[2.04s -> 10.17s]  So I'm thinking about a new intro screen that starts to play a loud like fallout boy song,
[10.17s -> 15.99s]  and it gets progressively louder and louder, starting at like 60 seconds until it is unbearably
[15.99s -> 21.16s]  loud. And every time like another number counts down on the screen starts at 60. Once we get to
[21.16s -> 27.72s]  like 15, the numbers start to fucking get huge. And like a big bass just explosion happens on
[27.72s -> 33.78s]  every countdown. It's like 15, boom, boom, and fallout boy gets louder and louder and louder
[33.78s -> 38.79s]  until it gets to zero. And then I come in, I'm like, Hey, everybody, welcome to the stream.
[38.79s -> 48.10s]  You guys like that? Should I put that one in a box and never open it again? I was thinking
[48.10s -> 54.73s]  about it sounds like pretty good, right? And there's like this fucking crumbs all over my chest
[54.73s -> 63.64s]  and like all of my mouth. I don't know why that would be there, but it is. I get that
[63.64s -> 70.22s]  one in the box. Hey, how you doing guys? You know, okay, I'm gonna give you guys a
[70.22s -> 76.79s]  tutorial on how to do the YouTuber and streamer yell. So you start normally like this,
[76.79s -> 81.67s]  right? And then almost almost pretend like you're yelling into a wall or like you've
[81.67s -> 86.76s]  ever yelled into a pillow. You pretend like the inside of your mouth is a pillow
[87.82s -> 93.98s]  that you're yelling into. So instead of being like, welcome to the stream. That's a fucking
[93.98s -> 100.02s]  yell. I just yelled. It's welcome to the stream. You almost like you use your teeth
[100.66s -> 117.03s]  as like a pretend muffler. So I used to do it. I think I got how do you think I made
[117.03s -> 121.93s]  fucking 50 trillion views on YouTube by doing the yell into the fucking teeth and
[122.73s -> 149.19s]  YouTube yell. Do you even know how to cook? This is cooking simulator. Just taking a sip
[149.19s -> 152.71s]  of my coffee hanging out here while I just made a tweet. I'm pretty much ready to go.
[156.20s -> 161.43s]  Came out today. Yes, it actually did release today. We don't have to pretend like I'm
[161.43s -> 164.95s]  going to stream this yesterday like I thought I was going to. It is now out. It's installed.
[164.95s -> 167.51s]  I actually have it up on the screen right now, but I'm not going to show you yet.
[175.00s -> 186.15s]  Show it. Not yet. It's not ready. It's not time. Not Hearthstone. That was still fun,
[186.15s -> 199.13s]  though. I had a good time. Well, here I'll have this ready. We already got right off the bat.
[199.13s -> 201.53s]  I've been waiting for this game for a long time. We've got some great music.
[207.93s -> 214.02s]  This is such unbelievably perfect in between announcements at the wedding music.
[218.06s -> 224.34s]  I'll give you an example. So for instance, okay, ladies and gentlemen, that that was it
[224.34s -> 229.22s]  for the first dance and your server will be coming around with the first course of dinner.
[229.22s -> 242.89s]  Enjoy it. We'll see you soon for the son and mother dance. It's every single one.
[242.89s -> 254.36s]  And for some weird reason, this stays on the whole time. Even when you're eating. I don't know why
[254.36s -> 258.87s]  they do that. Put on some like fucking Beethoven or something. That'd be more appropriate, right?
[263.46s -> 271.80s]  Anyway, we've wasted enough time. So I'm going to spend a little bit of time on this one guys
[271.80s -> 280.18s]  because I've been waiting for this for fucking ever. Cooking Simulator is the game that I've
[280.18s -> 289.18s]  been waiting for. This is my most anticipated game of 2019. No, it's not fucking Anthem 2
[289.18s -> 294.92s]  or whatever the hell is coming out. It's not like it's not destiny. Put a line through the two
[295.64s -> 307.45s]  and put it back on steam. No, it's this. So what should I do? Cooking School? Let me turn it up
[307.45s -> 318.38s]  a little bit. It's a little it's a little soft. There we go. Let's do cooking school.
[319.50s -> 327.58s]  Seasoning using if you have no idea what this game is. It's a cooking simulator. That's it.
[328.70s -> 339.32s]  There's nothing else. No shit. Wow. Okay, now it's really loud. Today's lesson is short,
[339.32s -> 342.68s]  but the skill you learn with it will determine whether you get tips or have to wrestle the
[342.68s -> 347.24s]  guests for money. Let's learn the basics how to season food. We need to wrestle the guests
[347.24s -> 352.66s]  for money. They're gonna steal? Target the salt container. Notice the number under the label.
[352.66s -> 359.43s]  Shows how much spice is left in the container. It's 500 gold in here. Okay,
[361.21s -> 364.97s]  now sprinkle the salmon and use the container to enter sprinkle mode.
[365.61s -> 375.34s]  All right, so this is sprinkle mode. Now for the actual seasoning. Aim for the fillet and use the
[375.34s -> 385.74s]  container until you season the fish with three grams of salt. Three. That was easy, wasn't it?
[385.74s -> 389.02s]  It gets a lot harder when the product is cut into pieces. Better practice your aim then.
[391.77s -> 406.46s]  What? That's that's not that's that's not too much salt. All right, so let's make a dish.
[408.95s -> 412.15s]  I am so fucking excited. You have no idea. Why is everything blue?
[414.12s -> 416.84s]  Think it's time you've served your first dish. Don't worry, I'll be here to guide you through
[416.84s -> 421.32s]  the whole process. This isn't a test, but if you run into trouble performing any task,
[421.32s -> 423.96s]  try one of the earlier lessons. All right, like seasoning the fish.
[426.89s -> 430.97s]  Steak with a side of french fries. Simple yet nuanced. There's no actual guest waiting,
[430.97s -> 438.98s]  so you can take your time. Simple yet nuanced. Look behind you. That's the checkout window.
[440.46s -> 443.82s]  Once we're done, you'll need to place the order on the shelf and use the tablet to
[443.82s -> 450.50s]  confirm. Simple yet nuanced. I don't think there's anything nuanced about getting a frozen
[450.50s -> 455.80s]  food section bag of french fries and a steak. I don't think that's very nuanced.
[458.92s -> 462.36s]  Look, someone ordered a dish. Every time a client orders something, you'll be notified
[462.36s -> 467.24s]  in the upper left corner of the screen. Notifications will also appear when you have
[467.24s -> 472.76s]  only a minute left to complete a dish. You're slightly late or when a client gives up waiting
[472.76s -> 478.60s]  and goes home. Imagine it takes that long for someone to make you food that you go home.
[481.00s -> 483.56s]  That's it. That's your order. Walk up to the display and press on the
[484.28s -> 491.37s]  steak with french fries. Take a good look at the screen. To the left,
[491.37s -> 495.53s]  you've got a list of ingredients. And to the right, what do you have to do with them?
[495.53s -> 499.29s]  Don't worry, we'll do it step by step. First, take the steak out of the refrigerator.
[501.96s -> 505.72s]  Imagine you order like steak and french fries from a place that like two hours go by.
[506.44s -> 512.78s]  You just leave. Why would you wait that long? I have a very strict policy on if the food is
[512.78s -> 523.02s]  not out in fucking 30 minutes or less, goodbye. If fucking Pizza Hut 20 years ago can come up with
[523.02s -> 528.58s]  that idea. 30 minutes or it's free. You can't make a fucking steak in 30 to 40 minutes.
[529.22s -> 536.90s]  I don't think so. Pizza Hut fucking made that a reality. All right, let's get a steak.
[537.38s -> 542.18s]  What we only have two. What does C mean? Is this the quality of the meat?
[544.25s -> 548.73s]  Try not to go bankrupt. Almost everything in the kitchen costs money. Plates, products,
[548.73s -> 553.53s]  and especially repairs. Don't take more than you need and keep an eye on your balance.
[553.53s -> 556.81s]  Once you're out of money, you're out of business. What is C?
[558.70s -> 565.00s]  Take, okay, take the steak out of the fridge. What is C? Does it sense?
[567.74s -> 573.18s]  All right, put down on the cutting board. Now pick up a salt and use it on the steak. 4G.
[575.64s -> 578.90s]  Hey, why don't I, never mind. All right, gotta get this right.
[581.96s -> 587.27s]  Pretty good. Now let's have some black pepper. Again, we'll need four grams on the steak. Okay,
[587.27s -> 600.73s]  so black pepper. All right, put this down. Pepper, four grams. Still on the save spot.
[602.02s -> 607.66s]  Okay, I did it. Time to heat things up. Turn on the griddle. It's right next to the fridge.
[607.66s -> 615.82s]  All right, put that down. Here's the griddle. Okay, turn it on. Put the steak on the
[615.82s -> 621.66s]  griddle. Target the steak to view its state. That green bar indicates that the food is cooked.
[623.86s -> 629.19s]  The little pan icon informs you that it's been fried. Look up. There's a spatula hanging above
[629.19s -> 640.63s]  the griddle. Take it. Precise handling of cooking the spatula. Ow, my hand.
[641.19s -> 645.11s]  Precise handling of tools in the kitchen is crucial. Holding down shift will open up new
[645.11s -> 650.52s]  ways. All right, I don't think I can take the fucking interlude wedding music. It's the same
[650.52s -> 654.84s]  loop. Holding down shift will open up new ways to manipulate whatever you are currently holding
[654.84s -> 660.65s]  in your hand. Oh, shift is like a context menu. We want to fry both sides of the steak so we need
[660.65s -> 664.25s]  to flip it. Target the steak. Use the spatula. Once the steak is on the spatula, target the
[664.25s -> 681.32s]  griddle and enter context. Hold the key to flip. All right, hold on. The steak is done.
[681.32s -> 685.48s]  It's done. Go and find some plate and paint that should be one on the storage shelf.
[685.48s -> 699.83s]  Do I take this off? Is it cooked? Shit. All right, I got it. We need a plate. Okay,
[699.83s -> 713.08s]  plate. Just put this down for a second. Move, move, move. I'm moving. How do I put this down?
[717.21s -> 730.26s]  Okay, back we go. Target the steak and plate it. Okay, put it down.
[730.98s -> 750.12s]  Put it down. Put down. Put container down. I just want to put it down. All right, pick up product.
[755.22s -> 758.98s]  Why can I pick it up? I need the spatula to pick this up. Where's the spatula?
[759.62s -> 778.87s]  I think I broke the tutorial. Target the steak and use the plate. Wait, I'm too tall.
[789.22s -> 793.46s]  All right, turn the fucking oven off. All right, now what? Oh, you want to put it
[793.46s -> 803.61s]  over here. Now take the cutting board. All right, I got the cutting board. Go to the pantry and buy
[803.61s -> 811.67s]  two potatoes. Potato one. Potato two. All right, now take them back to the countertop. We'll need
[811.67s -> 819.64s]  to cut them. I feel like I'm like my body is fucking so far away. Do I have the FOV too high?
[820.44s -> 840.49s]  Okay, here we go. You want me to just cut them? Okay, cut. Holy shit, this is unbelievable.
[842.39s -> 859.53s]  We don't want me. What? How many pieces? 10? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. How do I? Hold on,
[859.53s -> 873.43s]  rotate that around. 9, 10. Walk up to the deep fryer. Press the button to. All right,
[873.43s -> 877.67s]  the tutorial is kind of just like launch up at the top of the screen. Turn on the deep fryer.
[878.31s -> 887.21s]  What did that even just say? Okay, to the left is a fryer basket.
[888.81s -> 892.65s]  Pick up all the potato pieces. Put them into the basket and just target them and use the basket.
[901.22s -> 921.42s]  What? Why are they going through? Am I insane? Why did that fall? Okay, expand pickup range.
[927.05s -> 933.58s]  Expand pickup range. Oh, okay. I don't want this other whole potato though.
[936.14s -> 942.49s]  Target deep fryer. Place the basket inside. Now let's wait for the fries to cook. They're
[942.49s -> 970.25s]  supposed to be french fries. Oh, get the plate with steak. Are these done? How do I do it?
[970.25s -> 978.58s]  Rotate. This is so funny. I love this. Okay, you guess would be long gone by now.
[982.36s -> 987.86s]  Yeah, well, I'm just, I gotta learn the tools. Now to finish the dish, go to the herb
[987.86s -> 995.32s]  shelves in the pantry and add two rosemary twigs. This looks fucking terrible. I have two
[995.32s -> 1004.63s]  gigantic potato pieces. It's supposed to be fries. Whatever. All right, what do you want? Two twigs?
[1010.49s -> 1014.97s]  Done. I was, I don't know why I was making potato chips. All right, here we go.
[1016.82s -> 1075.78s]  Order up. Take a photo of your dish. I can fix this. Context, guys. All right, click.
[1075.78s -> 1085.06s]  Look at how good that looks. Save that one. All right, order up. Steak with fries. You need
[1085.06s -> 1093.77s]  to place the dish on the checkout counter left of the exit. Yeah, okay. Look at that. They didn't
[1093.77s -> 1100.76s]  even know that half of that shit touched the ground. How many fame points were given for
[1100.76s -> 1104.68s]  this dish? The better the restaurant, the higher the quality of dishes you need to prepare to
[1104.68s -> 1110.42s]  earn any fame. Poorly made meals will lower your fame rating. Taste, determined by the
[1110.42s -> 1115.78s]  technical and thermal quality of the dish. I cooked it to perfection almost. Cooking points,
[1115.78s -> 1119.54s]  how many points do you need to learn new dishes? The better you cook, the quicker
[1119.54s -> 1126.18s]  you can unlock new recipes. Nine cooking points. Some paid for the dish by the client. 45 cents.
[1126.90s -> 1133.85s]  Tip, a sign that the client liked the dish. Any complaints? Guest complaints. French fries
[1133.85s -> 1138.25s]  where there weren't enough salt on the french fries and there were some heating mistakes.
[1138.25s -> 1143.75s]  The temperature was perfect, but how does it make any sense? You want five-star quality food.
[1144.57s -> 1149.30s]  Go to fucking Burger King. How does it feel? Ready to take on the challenge of the kitchen
[1149.30s -> 1153.22s]  in your own? If not, you can always come back for a lesson or two. Cool. Okay. So I think I'm
[1153.22s -> 1167.48s]  understanding it. Advanced buying. All right, there's only a couple more. Buying items through
[1167.48s -> 1174.10s]  the shop UI. I've shown you previously how to buy products from shelves. However, not everything
[1174.10s -> 1180.22s]  can be found just lying around. This guy looks mean. Today you'll learn how to buy everything
[1180.22s -> 1189.24s]  you'll need and more. See that cardboard box? I need you to walk up to it. Now target box,
[1189.24s -> 1194.20s]  okay. That's a shop. This is the shop. Ooh, look at this. Look at all this fresh ingredients.
[1194.20s -> 1198.04s]  This is the shop screen. Items split into four categories and by default have sorted alphabetically.
[1201.59s -> 1205.99s]  Spices and liquids can only be bought here and they come only in larger amounts. So be prepared
[1205.99s -> 1209.99s]  to pay a handsome fee. If you have trouble keeping track of your tools and pots, you can
[1209.99s -> 1216.62s]  buy additional ones from the utensils tab. Be aware that quality doesn't come cheap. Now go
[1216.62s -> 1221.35s]  to the liquids tab. Avocado oil. The tabs at the bottom of the menu determine the sorting
[1221.35s -> 1228.10s]  order. I want you to select the right most sorting tab. Okay. Product should not be sorted
[1228.10s -> 1233.54s]  according to their price. Descending. If you haven't noticed, prices are denoted to the far
[1233.54s -> 1239.38s]  right in green or red if you don't have sufficient funds. I want you to get avocado
[1239.38s -> 1247.05s]  oil from this list. Buy it. Bottle of avocado oil. Leave the shop view. You can buy only
[1247.05s -> 1252.47s]  one item at a time. No tricks with a container this time. Okay. Don't forget this lesson. Many
[1252.47s -> 1262.34s]  items can only be bought this way. I was gonna drink it. All right, now what I want
[1262.34s -> 1268.26s]  you to do is I want you to chug the avocado oil. And when you do it, look right into the camera.
[1268.98s -> 1284.82s]  And I want you to say it. Never mind. Last one. Today I'll give you a quick tour of the kitchen.
[1284.82s -> 1288.58s]  Stay focused. You need to memorize all of this. Great. We can't have you wandering about
[1288.58s -> 1293.29s]  searching stuff while the guests are waiting. I'm gonna fucking ruin everything. Go to the
[1293.29s -> 1298.20s]  marker. Here you find mostly vegetables, some fruit, bread, and buns. Some of the products
[1298.20s -> 1301.64s]  you will need to unlock by learning new recipes. Look at that fucking pantry. That's
[1301.64s -> 1306.14s]  an envious pantry. Remember that you'll need to pay for the products and be sure to bring a
[1306.14s -> 1312.70s]  container if you want to carry more than one piece. Here you will find plate stacks. And
[1312.70s -> 1316.86s]  again, you have to pay for every single one. Once the dish is served, the price of the plate
[1316.86s -> 1321.42s]  will be added back to your account. Fucking expenses. You can also use plates to carry
[1321.42s -> 1326.81s]  things around the kitchen, but be careful these things break easy. Even more important
[1326.81s -> 1330.57s]  are the cardboard boxes. Trouble finding something, you can buy one from a box.
[1331.45s -> 1335.99s]  These shelves are used for storing herbs. Just as with everything else,
[1335.99s -> 1339.59s]  the herbs have to be purchased. You pay for every twig or leaf you take.
[1340.39s -> 1345.54s]  Go to the next marker. Okay. Let me, let me, I need to get reading comprehension here.
[1346.18s -> 1353.38s]  Fruits and vegetables are here. I can grab them. They cost money. Oils, seasonings,
[1353.38s -> 1360.57s]  spices, all right here. Herbs, right here. Plates. If I can't find like a fucking
[1360.57s -> 1365.21s]  tomato in here, if I can't see the tomato, then I go here and I can just, it's a big list.
[1367.27s -> 1373.61s]  Okay. In case there's a fire, break out the fire. This is the refrigerator. Here you can buy
[1373.61s -> 1376.49s]  fish, meat, cheese and fruits. Some of the products are hidden in the drawers at the
[1376.49s -> 1380.41s]  bottom of the fridge. Okay. So all the meats and cheeses and stuff are in the fridge.
[1382.98s -> 1386.58s]  The griddle is used for searing and frying. As long as the recipe doesn't call for any
[1386.58s -> 1391.70s]  fat such as oil, most meat needs to be fried on both sides. So don't forget to flip it.
[1392.42s -> 1398.33s]  The stove is your best friend here. You can boil, fry, grill with the right pan, of course.
[1398.33s -> 1403.62s]  Under the stove, there's even a backup oven. Remember that pots and pans come in different
[1403.62s -> 1407.38s]  shapes and sizes just because there are six burners doesn't mean you'll fit six containers
[1407.38s -> 1414.97s]  on the stove at the same time. This is really, really detailed. There's so much in this
[1414.97s -> 1420.01s]  game. I like already love it. If you wish you can cut on any flat surface, just grab a
[1420.01s -> 1426.28s]  knife. However, what did that say? However, pans are up below that. What did that say?
[1426.28s -> 1431.34s]  There are pots stored on another shelf on the floor. All right, what did that say?
[1436.33s -> 1439.93s]  Use the cutting board. But I said, however, the ground is preferred.
[1440.81s -> 1445.77s]  They can't, you know, if you need to use the ground, if you don't feel the need to
[1445.77s -> 1449.29s]  prepare before the workday or you're done for the day, you can use the clock to skip
[1449.29s -> 1462.14s]  the preparation phases at the beginning and end of each day. Okay. You'll use the faucet
[1462.14s -> 1466.14s]  mainly to fill pots. Most recipes assume that you will use cold water. So stay away from
[1466.14s -> 1471.91s]  the red handle unless you're told to use it. The oven is for baking. Be sure to use
[1471.91s -> 1475.75s]  baking trays. You can find them to the right. Remember, you can bake multiple different dishes
[1475.75s -> 1481.32s]  at the same time. Oh my god, the upper switch turns the oven on and off the lower controls
[1481.32s -> 1486.60s]  the heat. Baking times correspond to the first setting. So be careful not to burn your dish.
[1487.24s -> 1491.96s]  Okay, okay. I feel like somebody's taking me a tour of the spaceship. And they're telling
[1491.96s -> 1497.32s]  like, you know, like, hey, come and come and see the cockpit, son. And it looks like a
[1497.40s -> 1501.24s]  fucking HAL from 2001 Space Odyssey. That's what that's what it feels like.
[1503.06s -> 1506.82s]  These are deep fryers. They're empty. You need to push the left button to fill them with oil.
[1506.82s -> 1512.30s]  The right button drains the tank. Oh, and don't forget to use fryer baskets unless you want
[1512.30s -> 1516.23s]  third degree burns. I don't think I want that. Well, this one's pretty obvious. The grill is
[1516.23s -> 1519.51s]  for grilling. Just don't forget to flip whatever you're cooking. Most recipes require
[1519.51s -> 1529.34s]  that. Go to the next marker. Darts? This is the dart board. The food processor. Throw the
[1529.34s -> 1533.10s]  ingredients inside and push the button. Presto. You've got yourself a liquid blend. You can
[1533.10s -> 1539.75s]  always taste it if you forget what's inside. And it's a microwave. I don't know what this
[1539.75s -> 1545.70s]  thing is doing in a respectable kitchen. Best you forget it's here. And this, this shows why
[1545.70s -> 1549.30s]  this place nearly closed down. The last cook didn't even bother to bring darts. He threw
[1549.30s -> 1558.71s]  knives instead. Pathetic. Go to the next marker. You can use any of the screens in
[1558.71s -> 1562.55s]  the kitchen to view your current orders. Time left and recipe details. They're really useful.
[1563.11s -> 1571.51s]  Okay, any screen will show that stuff. What's this? This is your desk. The radio looks old,
[1571.51s -> 1575.51s]  but don't be fooled. You can set it to play your own mp3s and even interact
[1575.51s -> 1580.17s]  internet radio stations. The laptop won't cook for you, but it will help you run this place.
[1580.17s -> 1586.06s]  I'm sure the manager will explain everything in detail. The phone will come in handy when
[1586.06s -> 1589.10s]  something breaks down. Just pick up and walk up to whatever needs maintenance.
[1589.90s -> 1593.90s]  Pick it up so if it breaks, okay. Choose the service company wisely. Fast and cheap
[1593.90s -> 1596.94s]  might be a warning sign. Stuff might break before they even leave.
[1597.82s -> 1607.74s]  Holy shit, this is... I'm getting gaver overwhelmed. I'm getting gamer-whelmed.
[1608.38s -> 1612.81s]  And there's the checkup. Put your dish on the shelf and choose the tablet which
[1612.81s -> 1617.67s]  order you're about to serve. Just don't mix things up. Once it's out, it's out.
[1624.81s -> 1627.72s]  Alright, I have no idea what's going on.
[1629.40s -> 1631.80s]  And the final station, the garbage bin. If it's not good enough for you,
[1631.80s -> 1633.72s]  it's not good enough for your guests. Keep that in mind.
[1634.44s -> 1639.72s]  Alright, this was just a tour, but I hope you learned something. A true chef needs to
[1639.72s -> 1643.94s]  know his kitchen inside out. I'm... alright. We're gonna take this slow.
[1644.58s -> 1658.36s]  Here we go. Tutorials done. Wait a minute. Oh, fuck. I skipped two tutorials. I just...
[1658.36s -> 1663.05s]  it started here. No wonder I didn't know how to do this. Hold on.
[1663.77s -> 1668.66s]  Hello, the manager asked me to teach you a thing or two.
[1668.66s -> 1675.99s]  I thought I could watch the third tutorial. I'll teach you how to buy...
[1676.87s -> 1685.43s]  without wasting... Alright, this is important. I want you to walk up to the wooden racks
[1685.43s -> 1689.64s]  in the pantry. See? See those tomatoes? Buy a tomato.
[1690.73s -> 1693.29s]  Okay, take that tomato to the countertop and set it aside.
[1693.93s -> 1699.02s]  Time to buy a plate. It works the same as with buying products.
[1699.58s -> 1702.94s]  Do you see what I'm talking about? How I feel like I'm like 30 feet away from this?
[1703.50s -> 1716.09s]  I feel like... yeah, it's the FOV. I think I gotta turn the FOV down.
[1722.82s -> 1737.26s]  Right? This site... this feels a little better. We'll see how that goes.
[1738.20s -> 1741.96s]  Yeah, okay. This... this is context really, because look. Ready? See how far away I am
[1741.96s -> 1753.08s]  right now? Like... this is not right. I am... I'm fucking clearly very far away.
[1753.08s -> 1758.63s]  That's what's causing me all these problems. We'll do 75.
[1763.64s -> 1770.55s]  Yeah, that feels much better. Much better. I'm not gonna do the low...
[1770.55s -> 1772.63s]  Walk up to the tomatoes with the plate in hand and... okay, with...
[1772.63s -> 1775.51s]  Walk up to the tomatoes with the plate in hand and get three.
[1776.49s -> 1781.37s]  Yeah, I actually feel like I'm in the space now. Three tomatoes.
[1784.30s -> 1787.43s]  Okay, cool. So you have to like, carry stuff to plates.
[1792.94s -> 1796.94s]  All right. Cutting. This is where I fucked up last time, because I didn't know what to do.
[1797.50s -> 1805.88s]  Pay attention. I will. Easy to learn, but hard to master.
[1805.88s -> 1812.22s]  Put in the extra hours to practice once we're done. Grab the knife.
[1813.88s -> 1824.04s]  I have very clear posted streamer hours, okay? Why are you calling me during my streaming hours?
[1824.68s -> 1833.37s]  What did the tutorial just say? Okay, grab the knife.
[1836.58s -> 1842.31s]  All right, so... now I want you to cut the tomato into at least four pieces.
[1842.31s -> 1845.27s]  Just follow the instructions in the bottom right of the screen. Four pieces.
[1846.07s -> 1867.32s]  So like, one, two, three, four. Fuck. This is hard.
[1867.88s -> 1872.14s]  Can I like, get in closer? The chef's like, lean in and don't...
[1875.74s -> 1878.84s]  Okay, I know what I'm doing. Here we go. New game.
[1881.69s -> 1883.45s]  Most people skip tutorials. Don't do it.
[1883.45s -> 1885.21s]  Welcome to Cooking Simulator. As you've already noticed,
[1885.21s -> 1888.17s]  the restaurant you're now employed in does not have the greatest rating.
[1888.17s -> 1892.97s]  Your task is to restore it to its former glory and reach the highest level of prestige.
[1892.97s -> 1895.61s]  The last chef left the kitchen covered in sticky notes.
[1895.61s -> 1899.53s]  Maybe they'll come to use to you, good luck. All right, here we go.
[1899.53s -> 1902.84s]  Do you want to follow tutorial during first day? Yes.
[1902.84s -> 1907.43s]  Hi, I'm the manager of this place. Since it's your first day, I'll show you the ropes.
[1907.43s -> 1910.23s]  Wait, I didn't... I already did it. Did I need to be told twice?
[1910.23s -> 1913.70s]  I would get fired. In case you get lost.
[1916.18s -> 1919.62s]  Keybinding hints are always displayed in the bottom right corner, yeah?
[1919.62s -> 1925.62s]  During the tutorial, you can view your tasks in the bottom left corner of the screen, yeah?
[1925.62s -> 1929.64s]  Three, this tutorial will auto-save between stages.
[1929.64s -> 1932.28s]  If you get lost or stuck, you can always go back. Why didn't I just do this first?
[1932.84s -> 1937.06s]  All right, if you have to hold my hand the whole way through,
[1937.06s -> 1941.93s]  left this place in a sorry state. Get on the phone, we need to call some professionals.
[1944.33s -> 1948.98s]  Oh no, he turned the stove into aluminum foil. This looks like aluminum foil.
[1948.98s -> 1951.22s]  This is horrible. What do you mean he left in a bad state?
[1953.08s -> 1954.84s]  Did he have a fucking sledgehammer with him?
[1954.84s -> 1957.00s]  Was he... we had a baseball bat and was swinging it around?
[1957.64s -> 1961.27s]  All right, so we get a call. We need to get...
[1961.27s -> 1964.07s]  We need to get that gas cooker running as soon as possible.
[1964.07s -> 1967.80s]  So we have to go over here and say, get the gas cooker.
[1967.80s -> 1972.01s]  It'll take ages to repair that thing. We better hire someone that's fast
[1972.01s -> 1974.49s]  while hovering over the cooker press to select a company.
[1975.72s -> 1982.94s]  NiceCorp, Bakerson, Handyman at your service, Home Repair, fast and smooth,
[1983.82s -> 1990.34s]  Fast Service. I would never use a service that was called Fast Service.
[1990.34s -> 1996.63s]  To me, that... this is like a weird knockoff website of like this place.
[1996.63s -> 2001.34s]  They even got like a similar logo. I'm gonna go with NiceCorp.
[2001.34s -> 2011.40s]  Okay, so that takes... that's the time. So we gotta repair everything.
[2012.12s -> 2016.58s]  How much money do I have? We'll have NiceCorp do everything.
[2016.58s -> 2023.13s]  Gotta get a good reputation with one company. What else is just right?
[2026.04s -> 2028.92s]  Wait, do I have to do both of these? Does this count as one?
[2030.38s -> 2033.30s]  Lower Oven Left Fryer. I didn't do this one.
[2035.93s -> 2038.84s]  Lower Oven. Okay.
[2038.84s -> 2041.08s]  Put the phone away. We won't be needing it anytime soon.
[2041.08s -> 2042.84s]  So then you just wait till they're all fixed?
[2043.56s -> 2051.18s]  Okay, no time to take a breather. This place is empty and we're gonna do something about it.
[2051.18s -> 2055.96s]  You get some utensils. We gotta fill the restaurant.
[2055.96s -> 2061.48s]  Okay, I just left utensils. I don't have any utensils at all.
[2061.48s -> 2066.39s]  We need to get a blender. I'm running out of money.
[2066.39s -> 2068.63s]  Put the blender away. You can carry only one thing at a time.
[2072.94s -> 2075.99s]  I mean, very clearly the button says throw.
[2079.50s -> 2082.94s]  I can't... no. No, this is the first mission.
[2082.94s -> 2085.42s]  Put the blender away. Put the blender away.
[2086.23s -> 2091.29s]  I'm not going to throw it. Don't throw anything.
[2092.49s -> 2095.38s]  Hover over it and press E to pick up the box.
[2095.38s -> 2096.58s]  Put it down on the countertop.
[2098.20s -> 2100.04s]  Everything. You can throw everything.
[2100.04s -> 2103.51s]  I'm not going to do that right now.
[2103.51s -> 2105.83s]  Guys, this is going to be like a nice long stream.
[2106.55s -> 2108.95s]  You want me to automatically start spawning easy pizza?
[2108.95s -> 2113.91s]  I don't think you want that. I don't want that.
[2113.91s -> 2117.03s]  Okay, we need to buy a cooking tool. We need a bake tray.
[2117.67s -> 2122.78s]  So we need all this stuff. Use the shop to buy.
[2122.78s -> 2123.74s]  All right, so we can buy a knife.
[2125.02s -> 2127.42s]  Oh, you got to individually put everything down.
[2131.69s -> 2133.37s]  You have a power meter.
[2134.01s -> 2139.42s]  Holy shit.
[2142.46s -> 2143.58s]  All right, no more throwing.
[2144.78s -> 2146.54s]  I need to put the knife in the knife tray.
[2151.50s -> 2153.90s]  There. I'm doing this.
[2153.90s -> 2154.94s]  I'm going to play nice.
[2155.66s -> 2156.62s]  Pan. What does a pan go?
[2157.18s -> 2158.30s]  Underneath here, right?
[2164.60s -> 2167.67s]  Fuck. Just put it down.
[2167.67s -> 2169.38s]  Put it down. Pan.
[2171.77s -> 2174.76s]  Big pot. Big pot goes under here.
[2175.48s -> 2181.18s]  Barely. Fits under there.
[2181.99s -> 2182.87s]  Cutting board.
[2182.87s -> 2184.31s]  Wait, how many do I need? Two big pots?
[2184.95s -> 2198.12s]  Okay. Baking tray.
[2199.46s -> 2200.18s]  Oh, let's get that.
[2200.18s -> 2202.02s]  I need to remember where this shit is.
[2202.58s -> 2204.94s]  I'm going to put it in places that I know where it's going to be.
[2213.19s -> 2214.15s]  All right, last one.
[2214.71s -> 2215.43s]  A spatula.
[2215.99s -> 2218.47s]  I need to remember where this is going to be.
[2218.47s -> 2220.70s]  I'm going to put it over here.
[2221.34s -> 2225.03s]  Yeah, hang it right there.
[2225.03s -> 2229.77s]  This too. Can I put it up here?
[2233.16s -> 2235.82s]  Okay. Don't it go to the laptop?
[2235.82s -> 2236.62s]  We need to get a recipe.
[2237.18s -> 2241.99s]  Click on the recipe manager on the left side menu.
[2244.49s -> 2248.09s]  Click on the not owned tab to open the recipe.
[2249.18s -> 2250.30s]  Not owned.
[2250.30s -> 2254.36s]  Buy a recipe for baked trout.
[2255.45s -> 2256.25s]  Look at all this.
[2256.25s -> 2256.97s]  How many are there?
[2257.53s -> 2260.97s]  Oh man, that's fucking cool.
[2263.53s -> 2264.49s]  Oh, this is awesome.
[2264.49s -> 2266.17s]  All right. Baked trout.
[2266.81s -> 2270.10s]  So here's the recipe.
[2270.10s -> 2273.30s]  Take trout. Season with black pepper, thyme, dried, and dill.
[2273.30s -> 2274.58s]  I need black pepper.
[2274.58s -> 2275.54s]  Place on a baking tray.
[2275.54s -> 2276.58s]  Bake for 90 seconds.
[2276.58s -> 2277.62s]  Season with horseradish.
[2279.34s -> 2280.14s]  All right, buy it.
[2284.81s -> 2286.89s]  Unlock salmon steak and boiled potatoes.
[2286.89s -> 2288.17s]  Okay. I'm ready.
[2290.65s -> 2291.85s]  So we need to get fish.
[2292.41s -> 2293.13s]  How do we do this?
[2294.73s -> 2296.17s]  Where's my recipe?
[2296.17s -> 2300.73s]  Oh, okay. Owned.
[2302.26s -> 2302.98s]  Seven minutes?
[2303.78s -> 2309.22s]  What do I need to...
[2309.22s -> 2310.18s]  Hold on. Not owned.
[2312.33s -> 2313.69s]  Oh, I get it for free.
[2313.69s -> 2316.26s]  Tomato soup. Classic.
[2316.90s -> 2319.78s]  That should do for now.
[2319.78s -> 2321.54s]  We'll improve our menu once the business gets rolling.
[2323.90s -> 2324.30s]  All right.
[2324.86s -> 2325.82s]  Exit the laptop.
[2326.71s -> 2327.43s]  It's time to go.
[2327.99s -> 2329.67s]  Let's see. Repairs, utensils, recipes.
[2329.67s -> 2330.71s]  Yes, we need some spices.
[2330.71s -> 2331.91s]  Let's visit the shop.
[2331.91s -> 2336.70s]  We need salt.
[2337.34s -> 2340.38s]  All right. I gotta put this somewhere.
[2340.38s -> 2342.50s]  Somewhere where I know it's gonna be.
[2342.50s -> 2343.86s]  Somewhere I always know it's gonna be.
[2343.86s -> 2349.02s]  Right here. We're not open yet.
[2349.02s -> 2350.62s]  There's going to be much time for shopping.
[2350.62s -> 2351.42s]  Not gonna be much time.
[2351.42s -> 2352.62s]  Best we buy all that we need now.
[2353.42s -> 2355.26s]  Get everything. Dried dill.
[2356.14s -> 2358.36s]  All right. I need to know what this is gonna...
[2358.36s -> 2358.76s]  Over here.
[2359.40s -> 2362.47s]  Oh, no. That's fresh dill.
[2363.11s -> 2366.25s]  I'm gonna say this is the spice rack.
[2367.67s -> 2368.71s]  Should I do it alphabetical?
[2369.43s -> 2370.55s]  Yeah. D, dill.
[2371.11s -> 2371.67s]  B, black.
[2372.39s -> 2373.59s]  C, A, B, C.
[2373.59s -> 2374.47s]  All right. Hold on.
[2374.47s -> 2380.71s]  I'm doing it alphabetical.
[2380.71s -> 2392.42s]  Then we need horseradish dried.
[2395.45s -> 2397.05s]  QRS.
[2398.87s -> 2400.15s]  Powdered cayenne pepper.
[2400.87s -> 2401.99s]  All right. Here we go.
[2401.99s -> 2405.50s]  A, B. Wait.
[2405.50s -> 2407.42s]  All right. So we got dill.
[2407.42s -> 2408.46s]  A, B, C.
[2416.10s -> 2417.94s]  B, C, D.
[2419.35s -> 2420.15s]  E, F, G, H.
[2420.87s -> 2426.12s]  Okay. They're alphabetical now.
[2426.12s -> 2427.48s]  I just know if it's like black pepper.
[2427.48s -> 2432.42s]  B, liquids tab.
[2435.85s -> 2436.49s]  Chicken broth.
[2440.63s -> 2441.83s]  All the liquids are gonna go in the bottom.
[2444.38s -> 2445.42s]  Chicken broth.
[2445.42s -> 2451.38s]  B, sunflower oil.
[2453.40s -> 2464.58s]  S. Wait. Does it fit in there?
[2464.58s -> 2467.82s]  Why not?
[2467.82s -> 2474.18s]  What? It's too tall?
[2474.18s -> 2475.54s]  No. That's too high.
[2475.54s -> 2487.05s]  I want it in here.
[2487.05s -> 2488.57s]  Oh, right. It's made out of glass.
[2489.93s -> 2498.38s]  Wait. Can I use this?
[2498.38s -> 2500.38s]  How do I actually use this?
[2500.38s -> 2501.66s]  There we go. Move vertically.
[2512.65s -> 2514.09s]  How do I rotate it?
[2514.09s -> 2515.85s]  They didn't teach me how to use this yet.
[2515.85s -> 2524.92s]  Where's the trash?
[2524.92s -> 2526.28s]  Can I scoop this all up?
[2526.28s -> 2532.92s]  I have to do it one by one.
[2532.92s -> 2537.70s]  No. There has to be something.
[2537.70s -> 2539.94s]  Look. People break shit all the time in a restaurant.
[2539.94s -> 2541.70s]  If you guys ever worked in a kitchen like I have,
[2542.26s -> 2544.74s]  you understand how many bottles broke a day?
[2544.74s -> 2547.14s]  You don't understand how much food was just like dropped on the ground
[2547.14s -> 2549.94s]  and the bottle shattered and broken and wine bottles and stuff.
[2549.94s -> 2551.14s]  Happens like every 10 seconds.
[2551.78s -> 2570.92s]  I need...
[2570.92s -> 2572.52s]  Wait. I don't have any oil now.
[2572.52s -> 2575.38s]  I need to buy sunflower oil again because I...
[2578.44s -> 2579.00s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[2579.24s -> 2580.44s]  I need to bake me a baked trout.
[2580.44s -> 2581.64s]  Hold on. I miss an oil.
[2581.64s -> 2582.76s]  I need this. I need the oil.
[2582.76s -> 2584.28s]  Sunflower oil, right?
[2584.28s -> 2587.50s]  Don't worry. You have some help.
[2587.50s -> 2591.24s]  I need oil.
[2591.24s -> 2591.72s]  All right. Fuck it.
[2591.72s -> 2592.44s]  I'm just putting it up there.
[2592.44s -> 2593.56s]  Oh, God. Okay. Here we go.
[2593.56s -> 2594.12s]  Seven minutes.
[2594.92s -> 2595.48s]  What broke?
[2596.12s -> 2596.62s]  What?
[2598.60s -> 2599.32s]  What happened?
[2603.94s -> 2604.66s]  I don't understand.
[2608.04s -> 2608.60s]  I put it...
[2608.60s -> 2610.10s]  I did...
[2610.10s -> 2610.66s]  Open the refrigerator.
[2610.66s -> 2611.14s]  All right. Let's go.
[2611.70s -> 2614.14s]  Each product costs money.
[2614.14s -> 2614.94s]  So we need one.
[2614.94s -> 2616.70s]  You don't have to worry about supplies, but still you need...
[2616.70s -> 2617.66s]  Okay. One trout.
[2618.54s -> 2619.04s]  Got one.
[2619.58s -> 2626.78s]  Okay. Black pepper.
[2627.42s -> 2628.62s]  Five grams.
[2628.62s -> 2629.18s]  Black pepper.
[2629.18s -> 2629.74s]  Where's the pepper?
[2629.74s -> 2630.14s]  That's salt.
[2630.14s -> 2630.62s]  Where's the pepper?
[2630.62s -> 2631.18s]  Black pepper.
[2631.18s -> 2631.68s]  B.
[2637.78s -> 2638.28s]  Dill.
[2638.58s -> 2639.08s]  D.
[2643.69s -> 2644.09s]  Time.
[2644.09s -> 2644.59s]  T.
[2647.98s -> 2648.54s]  Okay. Here we go.
[2648.54s -> 2649.26s]  Five grams each.
[2650.06s -> 2653.98s]  Spin this around a little bit.
[2653.98s -> 2654.94s]  Rotate it like this.
[2656.70s -> 2658.82s]  I want to rotate it around.
[2658.82s -> 2660.10s]  I want it sideways.
[2660.10s -> 2666.42s]  I want it sideways.
[2666.42s -> 2667.99s]  Whatever.
[2667.99s -> 2668.63s]  Five grams.
[2668.63s -> 2670.31s]  Okay. Here we go.
[2670.31s -> 2679.91s]  Got it.
[2679.91s -> 2680.95s]  Dried dill.
[2680.95s -> 2698.23s]  Pretty good evening seasoning.
[2698.23s -> 2698.73s]  Five. Okay.
[2699.59s -> 2700.09s]  What am I...
[2700.95s -> 2701.75s]  Dill?
[2701.75s -> 2702.71s]  This dill needs dill?
[2703.27s -> 2706.42s]  How much is on there?
[2706.42s -> 2706.90s]  That's okay.
[2707.46s -> 2707.96s]  I missed.
[2709.99s -> 2710.49s]  Okay.
[2711.03s -> 2711.99s]  Baking tray.
[2711.99s -> 2712.87s]  Under here.
[2712.87s -> 2718.94s]  Oven.
[2718.94s -> 2732.25s]  Turn on the oven.
[2732.25s -> 2732.89s]  What's the degrees?
[2734.26s -> 2735.22s]  We need a lemon.
[2735.22s -> 2742.07s]  How long does it take?
[2742.81s -> 2745.06s]  Do I have a timer?
[2745.06s -> 2746.10s]  Four pieces.
[2746.10s -> 2758.66s]  Damn it!
[2759.22s -> 2760.02s]  Come on!
[2760.02s -> 2764.15s]  That's fine.
[2764.15s -> 2768.38s]  Hey, put this down.
[2768.38s -> 2769.80s]  What do I do with the lemons?
[2769.80s -> 2772.07s]  Is this done?
[2772.07s -> 2775.96s]  What do I do with the lemons?
[2782.18s -> 2783.22s]  This is scary.
[2783.22s -> 2785.46s]  Imagine you go into a restaurant in the back
[2785.46s -> 2786.98s]  and the chef could be doing anything else.
[2787.85s -> 2790.65s]  And he's just fucking staring, just waiting.
[2790.65s -> 2794.09s]  How long does it take?
[2794.09s -> 2798.42s]  How do I know when it's done?
[2798.42s -> 2799.54s]  It's not burnt.
[2799.54s -> 2802.22s]  Fridge is still open.
[2802.22s -> 2802.78s]  It's wasting it.
[2802.78s -> 2803.42s]  All right.
[2803.42s -> 2814.57s]  Don't blow up the propane tank.
[2816.94s -> 2819.08s]  That was very violent mopping.
[2819.08s -> 2819.56s]  Is it done?
[2821.42s -> 2822.06s]  I need to check.
[2822.06s -> 2823.67s]  Is it done?
[2823.67s -> 2823.99s]  It's done!
[2823.99s -> 2824.31s]  It's done!
[2824.31s -> 2824.81s]  It's done!
[2825.99s -> 2826.87s]  My hands!
[2826.87s -> 2827.37s]  Ow!
[2828.36s -> 2829.00s]  All right.
[2829.00s -> 2829.80s]  Is it done?
[2829.80s -> 2832.87s]  No, it's not done.
[2836.47s -> 2836.97s]  Oh, fuck!
[2838.10s -> 2839.46s]  I can't feel my hands anymore.
[2842.95s -> 2843.83s]  Okay, it's done.
[2844.71s -> 2858.79s]  I need a plate.
[2858.79s -> 2859.35s]  Okay.
[2859.35s -> 2862.84s]  Transfer the product.
[2863.16s -> 2864.76s]  Five grams of horseradish.
[2864.76s -> 2870.07s]  My hands are probably so inflamed.
[2870.07s -> 2874.31s]  I probably have huge, huge Mickey Mouse glove hands right now
[2874.31s -> 2875.59s]  because it's swelling up.
[2875.59s -> 2875.83s]  All right.
[2875.83s -> 2876.47s]  Five grams.
[2889.38s -> 2894.10s]  Now pick up the lemon quarters and target them and expand.
[2894.10s -> 2894.60s]  Wait.
[2895.70s -> 2895.94s]  Okay.
[2895.94s -> 2896.50s]  So here we go.
[2899.13s -> 2900.65s]  That looks horrible.
[2902.62s -> 2903.58s]  That's just a joke.
[2904.30s -> 2906.78s]  Just serve it with one lemon.
[2906.78s -> 2911.02s]  Parsley leaves.
[2911.66s -> 2913.64s]  One, two, three.
[2915.88s -> 2916.38s]  Serve it.
[2917.08s -> 2917.80s]  Put it on the counter.
[2918.84s -> 2920.52s]  Wait, can I like move it around a little?
[2923.62s -> 2924.26s]  Well, okay.
[2924.98s -> 2925.46s]  Enter the...
[2926.58s -> 2928.18s]  Like that looks bad.
[2928.82s -> 2971.27s]  Okay, hold on.
[2971.27s -> 2971.75s]  Looks good.
[2977.48s -> 2977.96s]  Midnight.
[2977.96s -> 2978.46s]  Okay.
[2978.84s -> 2988.39s]  Okay, hide the UI.
[2988.39s -> 2988.95s]  Take the picture.
[2991.93s -> 2992.65s]  Save it.
[2992.65s -> 2993.85s]  Looks fucking pretty good, actually.
[2995.00s -> 2996.76s]  Put it on grandma's Facebook.
[2997.48s -> 2997.98s]  Ding.
[3001.51s -> 3002.01s]  Taste?
[3002.86s -> 3003.82s]  Almost five stars.
[3004.46s -> 3008.76s]  Pretty good.
[3008.76s -> 3009.96s]  What are the complaints?
[3009.96s -> 3010.76s]  It was perfect.
[3011.24s -> 3014.28s]  The lemon quarters were not cut perfectly.
[3015.67s -> 3016.47s]  Yeah, whatever.
[3016.47s -> 3017.19s]  You're gonna come back.
[3018.81s -> 3019.45s]  That's it for today.
[3019.45s -> 3021.45s]  Tomorrow we'll be open for business, so do your best.
[3021.45s -> 3021.85s]  All right.
[3025.30s -> 3028.42s]  After each day, you'll be presented with a summary of progress the restaurant made.
[3030.04s -> 3032.36s]  Our goal is to reach full five-star fame rating.
[3032.36s -> 3033.88s]  As you can see, there's still a lot ahead of us.
[3033.88s -> 3034.44s]  Yes, there is.
[3035.00s -> 3037.14s]  Total income, negative $1,400.
[3038.26s -> 3039.46s]  How much money do I have?
[3044.09s -> 3044.33s]  All right.
[3044.33s -> 3045.05s]  This is where it begins.
[3048.78s -> 3052.06s]  Experience points come primarily from serving dishes and doing daily quests.
[3053.10s -> 3055.42s]  Once you gain enough experience, you will automatically level up.
[3056.06s -> 3059.21s]  We get to choose a perk.
[3060.22s -> 3061.02s]  There are perks.
[3061.90s -> 3062.40s]  Okay.
[3063.02s -> 3065.96s]  Perks are very powerful unique abilities.
[3065.96s -> 3068.84s]  Once every few levels, you'll be given an option to choose one.
[3068.84s -> 3070.76s]  This choice can't be postponed or undone,
[3070.76s -> 3073.48s]  so take your time and pick what you think will be the most useful.
[3074.28s -> 3077.86s]  Can you view perks?
[3077.86s -> 3079.70s]  You're already using your perk browser app.
[3079.70s -> 3080.42s]  Okay, hold on.
[3080.42s -> 3081.22s]  Long reach.
[3081.22s -> 3082.10s]  Long arms.
[3082.10s -> 3084.34s]  Longer reach from picking up and putting down items.
[3084.34s -> 3085.94s]  Have really long fucking arms.
[3087.24s -> 3088.04s]  Fast feet.
[3088.04s -> 3090.04s]  Get at three skill points that are unlocking a perk.
[3092.02s -> 3092.74s]  Steady hands.
[3094.20s -> 3096.84s]  Hold down shift to freeze items in place while cutting.
[3096.84s -> 3098.52s]  That's what's going on here.
[3098.52s -> 3099.24s]  I want this one.
[3105.27s -> 3106.23s]  Lower score requirements.
[3106.23s -> 3107.59s]  Pass the food critics.
[3107.59s -> 3110.31s]  Learn the temperature of ingredients in a closed oven.
[3110.31s -> 3111.27s]  Oh, that's good.
[3115.14s -> 3116.50s]  Time slows down while cutting.
[3117.22s -> 3120.07s]  Once per day, reset the timer of an active order.
[3122.87s -> 3126.87s]  Reroll order grants a magic wand that removes all stains and shards.
[3126.87s -> 3127.91s]  I mean steady hands.
[3129.16s -> 3129.72s]  That's...
[3129.72s -> 3130.68s]  I have to use that.
[3134.68s -> 3136.52s]  Skill points are used to unlock and upgrade skills.
[3136.52s -> 3139.16s]  With each level, you gain a certain amount of SPs.
[3139.16s -> 3139.88s]  You can spend them...
[3139.88s -> 3140.20s]  Okay.
[3141.66s -> 3142.62s]  What do I have for points?
[3142.62s -> 3143.26s]  I got three.
[3144.06s -> 3145.72s]  Oh my god.
[3153.06s -> 3157.59s]  All right, so income.
[3157.59s -> 3160.15s]  Pay 10% more for their orders without affecting the score.
[3160.71s -> 3163.27s]  10% more cooking points.
[3165.38s -> 3166.82s]  Kitchen decorations are cheaper.
[3166.82s -> 3169.94s]  You earn 50 more experience points for dish stars.
[3170.90s -> 3173.06s]  Chain four star dishes to earn more fame.
[3173.86s -> 3175.38s]  Liquids cost less.
[3175.38s -> 3176.50s]  Products cost less.
[3179.83s -> 3181.11s]  Spices are less.
[3181.11s -> 3182.79s]  Gifts, guest tip, more.
[3183.43s -> 3187.29s]  I think I'm gonna go with they pay more money.
[3190.74s -> 3192.74s]  Yeah, I want 30% more money.
[3193.38s -> 3196.90s]  All right, the joke's over.
[3196.90s -> 3198.10s]  It's time to fucking actually play.
[3198.66s -> 3201.24s]  This is the real game now.
[3204.79s -> 3206.06s]  All right, here we go.
[3206.70s -> 3210.06s]  Remember, everything you serve today will affect your reputation.
[3210.70s -> 3213.10s]  Let's do this.
[3213.10s -> 3214.70s]  Let's make the best restaurant in the city.
[3217.75s -> 3220.87s]  By throwing the propane tank into the microwave and turning it off for five minutes.
[3221.43s -> 3223.05s]  The name should tell the story.
[3223.05s -> 3226.01s]  No orders yet, but you can use anything in the kitchen to prepare for the day.
[3226.81s -> 3229.18s]  Make sure to prepare the ingredients you'll be using.
[3229.18s -> 3231.74s]  Getting a head start on some of the dishes is also a good idea.
[3231.74s -> 3232.94s]  As long as you know what you're doing.
[3234.30s -> 3235.74s]  There's fucking rumors in this game.
[3238.04s -> 3240.28s]  I just had a flash of...
[3242.41s -> 3243.13s]  Okay, hold on.
[3247.96s -> 3248.92s]  I feel bad right now.
[3248.92s -> 3249.16s]  Okay.
[3249.80s -> 3250.84s]  Let's pick what we left off.
[3250.84s -> 3251.96s]  Open the skill manager app.
[3254.06s -> 3254.70s]  That's bright.
[3256.41s -> 3257.05s]  Mm-hmm.
[3257.05s -> 3260.44s]  If you didn't spend your skill points, you can do so now.
[3260.44s -> 3260.76s]  I did.
[3264.07s -> 3266.71s]  You can choose to save up points and use the app later.
[3266.71s -> 3267.03s]  Okay.
[3269.08s -> 3270.28s]  You can get decorations.
[3271.32s -> 3274.28s]  Reset all of your points, but that's going to cost you money.
[3275.53s -> 3276.09s]  Makes sense.
[3278.79s -> 3279.59s]  Perk browser.
[3281.22s -> 3283.46s]  You can actually select perks.
[3283.46s -> 3284.74s]  It's like Call of Duty.
[3286.07s -> 3286.47s]  All right.
[3286.47s -> 3288.47s]  Okay, hold down shift to freeze items while cutting.
[3289.82s -> 3290.54s]  All right, let's go.
[3291.86s -> 3292.98s]  Yikes, look at the time.
[3292.98s -> 3294.18s]  We need to open right away.
[3294.18s -> 3294.90s]  Let's get cooking.
[3296.14s -> 3296.78s]  What?
[3296.78s -> 3297.42s]  It's time to...
[3297.42s -> 3297.98s]  I'm not ready.
[3298.70s -> 3300.62s]  I thought you might still need me today, so I'm here.
[3300.62s -> 3301.42s]  But only for today.
[3301.42s -> 3302.46s]  Don't get too attached.
[3305.19s -> 3306.07s]  Dish salmon.
[3306.07s -> 3307.99s]  Oh, I actually have a timer now.
[3308.87s -> 3309.51s]  Find a big pot.
[3309.51s -> 3310.55s]  We'll need to boil the potatoes.
[3317.38s -> 3320.18s]  Fill it with one cup of water.
[3320.18s -> 3322.87s]  How do I know how much water I'm going to get?
[3322.87s -> 3324.30s]  How do I turn it on?
[3326.18s -> 3327.46s]  How do I turn the faucet on?
[3329.56s -> 3330.52s]  No, is this cold or hot?
[3330.52s -> 3331.40s]  That's hot water.
[3331.40s -> 3331.64s]  All right.
[3331.64s -> 3333.00s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[3333.00s -> 3333.72s]  Cold water.
[3333.72s -> 3334.92s]  E.
[3334.92s -> 3335.64s]  How much water?
[3336.36s -> 3341.82s]  I feel like I'm at a gas station.
[3342.22s -> 3349.82s]  Okay, got it.
[3349.82s -> 3350.86s]  20 grams of salt?
[3350.86s -> 3351.74s]  That's too much salt.
[3356.17s -> 3357.05s]  Ugh.
[3357.05s -> 3360.36s]  We need two potatoes.
[3369.38s -> 3370.26s]  Potatoes.
[3370.26s -> 3370.58s]  Two of them.
[3370.58s -> 3371.14s]  How do I buy two?
[3371.14s -> 3371.94s]  Can I buy more than one?
[3378.94s -> 3379.66s]  All right.
[3379.66s -> 3380.46s]  Boil potatoes.
[3381.38s -> 3382.58s]  Cook for 120 seconds.
[3383.22s -> 3385.78s]  Is this the right one?
[3385.78s -> 3388.17s]  Okay, that's the right one.
[3388.17s -> 3389.05s]  120 seconds.
[3389.05s -> 3389.69s]  Count.
[3389.69s -> 3390.49s]  One.
[3390.49s -> 3391.13s]  Two.
[3391.13s -> 3392.01s]  Where were we at?
[3392.01s -> 3393.03s]  10?
[3393.03s -> 3393.91s]  Okay, so 10...
[3393.91s -> 3395.59s]  120 seconds is two minutes.
[3395.59s -> 3397.35s]  So when this gets to 10, twice.
[3397.35s -> 3397.83s]  Okay, go.
[3407.54s -> 3408.74s]  Okay, boil potato.
[3408.74s -> 3409.30s]  Boil...
[3409.30s -> 3412.74s]  Where's my cutting board?
[3412.74s -> 3413.54s]  Okay, got salmon.
[3419.38s -> 3419.78s]  I just got...
[3419.78s -> 3420.50s]  I already have one.
[3421.43s -> 3422.23s]  I have one.
[3422.79s -> 3423.35s]  All right.
[3423.35s -> 3424.15s]  Fish on the cutting board.
[3424.15s -> 3424.47s]  Got it.
[3426.55s -> 3428.39s]  We need salt and black pepper.
[3428.39s -> 3430.23s]  How much do we need?
[3430.23s -> 3431.03s]  5 grams?
[3431.03s -> 3437.67s]  Okay, black pepper.
[3440.34s -> 3440.58s]  10?
[3441.91s -> 3442.23s]  Okay.

[3443.91s -> 3445.90s]  Where's black pepper?
[3445.90s -> 3446.70s]  Where's black pepper?
[3446.70s -> 3453.74s]  Give me it.
[3453.74s -> 3458.44s]  Frying in oil.
[3458.44s -> 3459.24s]  Oh my god.
[3460.70s -> 3461.74s]  Put it back in.
[3461.74s -> 3462.70s]  Put it back in.
[3462.70s -> 3464.31s]  How do I put it back in?
[3464.31s -> 3464.81s]  Okay.
[3466.71s -> 3467.21s]  Okay.
[3470.60s -> 3471.80s]  I need sunflower oil.
[3473.00s -> 3474.20s]  Well, don't step on the glass.
[3474.20s -> 3475.24s]  Watch out for your bare feet.
[3476.41s -> 3478.23s]  How much oil do I need in the pan?
[3478.23s -> 3479.51s]  10 milliliters.
[3488.76s -> 3489.56s]  Tilt the bottle.
[3493.00s -> 3493.50s]  Oh!
[3494.52s -> 3499.30s]  Get the salmon in there.
[3499.30s -> 3500.34s]  That looks fucking amazing.
[3500.34s -> 3501.86s]  I have bugs on it.
[3501.86s -> 3503.30s]  Why are there ants on this?
[3504.74s -> 3506.10s]  Fry the steak for 60 seconds.
[3508.57s -> 3510.02s]  10?
[3510.02s -> 3511.75s]  Are they done?
[3511.75s -> 3514.58s]  Wait, are these done?
[3514.58s -> 3516.42s]  Oh, that's not real time.
[3517.94s -> 3519.54s]  Hold.
[3519.54s -> 3519.94s]  Okay.
[3519.94s -> 3521.06s]  What do I do with this?
[3521.06s -> 3524.76s]  Pick up the potato straight from the pot into the plate.
[3524.76s -> 3526.54s]  What plate?
[3526.54s -> 3528.31s]  What plate?
[3528.31s -> 3528.63s]  Plate.
[3528.63s -> 3529.19s]  I need plate.

[3531.16s -> 3531.72s]  Deep plate.
[3535.66s -> 3539.32s]  Okay.
[3539.32s -> 3540.36s]  Just put this down.
[3540.36s -> 3542.78s]  How about the salmon?
[3542.78s -> 3546.54s]  Is the salmon doing all right?
[3546.54s -> 3547.42s]  Why is it not cooking?
[3547.42s -> 3548.30s]  Okay, hold on.
[3548.30s -> 3549.82s]  Do I have to cut these?
[3549.82s -> 3550.78s]  Oh, god damn it.
[3550.78s -> 3551.42s]  It's not on.
[3551.42s -> 3552.47s]  Okay, hold on.
[3552.47s -> 3564.55s]  Spatula.
[3564.55s -> 3565.27s]  When do I flip it?
[3567.64s -> 3569.24s]  Don't you not flip salmon?
[3569.24s -> 3570.36s]  I know how to cook salmon.
[3570.36s -> 3571.00s]  You don't flip it.
[3571.72s -> 3572.44s]  You cover it.
[3573.24s -> 3573.88s]  Where's the coven?
[3575.05s -> 3576.57s]  Where's the coven for the oven?
[3576.57s -> 3577.37s]  Where's the coven?
[3577.37s -> 3579.53s]  Where are the vampire ladies that are gonna eat me?
[3586.97s -> 3587.85s]  These are gonna get cold.
[3589.37s -> 3590.17s]  How much time do I have?
[3591.88s -> 3592.44s]  Three minutes.
[3593.00s -> 3598.92s]  Can I turn the heat up?
[3604.09s -> 3605.13s]  Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[3605.13s -> 3606.65s]  Let's go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[3619.40s -> 3620.60s]  Wait, now it's...
[3620.60s -> 3621.32s]  Now I can't.
[3622.92s -> 3624.04s]  I have to do it again.
[3624.04s -> 3624.68s]  Flip it again.
[3625.67s -> 3626.31s]  Okay, we're good.
[3628.04s -> 3628.84s]  60 seconds.
[3628.84s -> 3629.72s]  Timer.
[3629.72s -> 3640.23s]  All right, 50 seconds.
[3640.23s -> 3650.01s]  Is it almost done?
[3650.57s -> 3655.91s]  What do I do in the meantime?
[3655.91s -> 3656.55s]  I got two minutes.
[3656.55s -> 3657.43s]  I'm fine.
[3657.43s -> 3659.05s]  I think I'm gonna have to cut up the potatoes though.
[3659.61s -> 3660.33s]  Are they still hot?
[3660.33s -> 3661.37s]  Yeah, they are.
[3661.37s -> 3662.36s]  Let me test.
[3662.92s -> 3668.76s]  Give me this.
[3675.26s -> 3676.06s]  I just heard a rumor.
[3682.36s -> 3682.68s]  All right.
[3684.14s -> 3684.54s]  Come on.
[3685.62s -> 3686.26s]  How much time?
[3687.82s -> 3688.78s]  I still got a little bit of time.
[3692.58s -> 3693.62s]  Perfectly calculated.
[3701.22s -> 3701.70s]  Put it down.
[3702.42s -> 3703.54s]  Just put the salmon down.
[3705.34s -> 3706.78s]  That's not cooked on the bottom.
[3707.50s -> 3709.78s]  Stop it!
[3709.78s -> 3710.26s]  Leave me a...
[3710.90s -> 3718.92s]  Pick up the plate with the salmon.
[3722.62s -> 3723.90s]  Put the plate on the serving shell.
[3724.54s -> 3725.74s]  This is not ready to serve.
[3727.90s -> 3730.78s]  You just want two fucking baked potatoes?
[3730.78s -> 3732.22s]  This is not even food.
[3733.02s -> 3733.26s]  What?
[3733.82s -> 3738.57s]  This looks like a dessert.
[3738.57s -> 3739.45s]  This looks like a cake.
[3740.01s -> 3755.24s]  No, that's a cake.
[3761.54s -> 3763.78s]  Imagine being served salmon like this.
[3763.78s -> 3764.98s]  Sitting up on its side.
[3766.06s -> 3766.94s]  You'd be like...
[3766.94s -> 3768.22s]  The chef is fucking drunk.
[3779.27s -> 3780.15s]  Not bad, actually.
[3784.58s -> 3785.78s]  I got a seven cent tip.
[3786.34s -> 3787.38s]  What were the complaints?
[3789.29s -> 3790.57s]  Heating mistakes.
[3790.57s -> 3792.94s]  Too much oil on the steak.
[3794.33s -> 3794.73s]  Yeah.
[3794.73s -> 3798.62s]  Well, he still ate it.
[3798.62s -> 3799.42s]  No time for slacking off.
[3799.42s -> 3800.06s]  Next order is here.
[3800.06s -> 3800.86s]  Tomato soup.
[3800.86s -> 3803.26s]  Wait, what do I have to do?
[3803.98s -> 3804.94s]  We need a big pot.
[3804.94s -> 3805.26s]  Find one.
[3805.26s -> 3805.98s]  Make sure it's empty.
[3806.97s -> 3807.37s]  Oh, fuck.
[3807.37s -> 3808.41s]  This is still boiling.
[3808.41s -> 3816.14s]  I'm trying to get it in the sink.
[3817.82s -> 3822.17s]  I'm gonna get myself a headache.
[3824.87s -> 3826.95s]  You just throw that into the ground.
[3829.82s -> 3831.02s]  How do I open this?
[3832.14s -> 3833.58s]  Open the chicken broth.
[3833.58s -> 3834.30s]  How much do we need?
[3834.30s -> 3835.82s]  700 milliliters?
[3835.82s -> 3836.22s]  All right.
[3836.22s -> 3836.86s]  Get it in there.
[3839.64s -> 3841.00s]  Stop pouring it.
[3844.79s -> 3845.19s]  All right.
[3845.19s -> 3846.07s]  Season the broth.
[3847.27s -> 3853.19s]  I need cayenne pepper to the pot.
[3853.19s -> 3854.23s]  12 grams.
[3854.23s -> 3858.71s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[3859.35s -> 3862.10s]  And we need some cayenne pepper.
[3862.10s -> 3862.82s]  Where's cayenne?
[3863.38s -> 3864.10s]  Horseradish.
[3864.74s -> 3865.14s]  Cayenne?
[3866.02s -> 3866.74s]  Time.
[3866.74s -> 3868.18s]  I need cayenne.
[3868.18s -> 3868.50s]  Now.
[3868.50s -> 3872.62s]  I need it right now.
[3872.62s -> 3873.66s]  Six grams.
[3873.66s -> 3877.10s]  Good.
[3877.10s -> 3877.42s]  Okay.
[3877.42s -> 3878.14s]  I need tomatoes.
[3880.86s -> 3882.22s]  Add fucking salt.
[3882.22s -> 3882.62s]  God damn it.
[3882.62s -> 3883.50s]  Where is it?
[3883.50s -> 3891.48s]  Okay.
[3891.48s -> 3892.20s]  Done.
[3892.20s -> 3896.63s]  Take the pot into the pantry and put eight tomatoes in here.
[3903.83s -> 3904.95s]  Eight tomatoes.
[3904.95s -> 3905.91s]  We need an onion.
[3905.91s -> 3906.15s]  What?
[3906.71s -> 3911.58s]  This isn't how you make tomato soup.
[3915.10s -> 3916.06s]  Why do I get gas?
[3922.06s -> 3922.30s]  Oh.
[3929.05s -> 3930.12s]  Okay.
[3930.12s -> 3931.16s]  Boil the soup.
[3931.16s -> 3933.46s]  How much time do I got?
[3933.46s -> 3933.94s]  Five minutes.
[3933.94s -> 3934.82s]  I got plenty of time.
[3934.82s -> 3936.76s]  What was in here?
[3936.76s -> 3937.00s]  What?
[3946.98s -> 3949.06s]  I guess you can throw that away.
[3949.06s -> 3949.54s]  Hold on.
[3951.90s -> 3953.02s]  This is dirty.
[3953.02s -> 3954.22s]  I need to throw it away.
[3961.29s -> 3963.21s]  Fucking dogshit restaurant.
[3963.21s -> 3963.93s]  This is so fun.
[3963.93s -> 3965.21s]  How do I clean the top?
[3965.77s -> 3967.85s]  How do I clean in there?
[3967.85s -> 3974.55s]  Is it boiling yet?
[3978.68s -> 3979.72s]  Can I buy a sponge?
[3984.44s -> 3984.68s]  All right.
[3984.68s -> 3985.32s]  This is...
[3985.32s -> 3986.44s]  They're almost done.
[3986.44s -> 3992.39s]  Turn off the heat and blend the contents.
[3992.39s -> 3992.63s]  What?
[3993.35s -> 4000.57s]  Okay.
[4000.57s -> 4001.05s]  Turn it on.
[4015.74s -> 4016.46s]  I'm trying to draw.
[4017.02s -> 4018.39s]  It's a mouse scroll?
[4019.45s -> 4020.17s]  Oh my god.
[4020.97s -> 4035.82s]  All right.
[4035.82s -> 4036.06s]  Done.
[4036.62s -> 4039.85s]  Okay.
[4039.85s -> 4040.65s]  What do I need now?
[4040.65s -> 4041.69s]  Pour sour cream?
[4042.33s -> 4044.14s]  Pour sour cream.
[4044.14s -> 4044.94s]  Whisk sour cream.
[4045.50s -> 4046.55s]  I already have it.
[4046.55s -> 4053.50s]  It's already over here.
[4053.50s -> 4053.82s]  Okay.
[4053.82s -> 4054.86s]  This is not...
[4054.86s -> 4056.14s]  You have to easily till.
[4056.14s -> 4056.78s]  How much?
[4056.78s -> 4057.34s]  150.
[4066.98s -> 4067.14s]  No.
[4072.33s -> 4072.89s]  Deep plate.
[4076.82s -> 4077.06s]  Okay.
[4078.02s -> 4080.34s]  Take the pot and target the deep plate.
[4080.42s -> 4082.50s]  And press to hold down while pouring this...
[4082.50s -> 4082.66s]  Wait.
[4082.66s -> 4082.98s]  You don't...
[4082.98s -> 4084.18s]  I have to pour the soup?
[4092.26s -> 4093.14s]  Nobody doesn't use...
[4093.14s -> 4093.62s]  You lay...
[4093.62s -> 4094.90s]  It was a ladle.
[4094.90s -> 4101.11s]  This is not what I'm supposed to do, right?
[4106.25s -> 4109.05s]  That was the whole pot.
[4109.05s -> 4113.51s]  This is a huge serving.
[4113.51s -> 4143.93s]  Imagine being served a full pot of tomato soup.
[4143.93s -> 4145.45s]  That's a full five right there.
[4150.26s -> 4150.98s]  Any complaints?
[4152.25s -> 4154.17s]  Technique was perfect.
[4154.17s -> 4155.29s]  Wrong amount of product.
[4156.81s -> 4158.41s]  What do you mean wrong amount of product?
[4158.41s -> 4160.41s]  Are they done with 149?
[4160.41s -> 4164.78s]  Whatever.
[4164.78s -> 4165.42s]  I'm still going.
[4168.90s -> 4169.70s]  One baked trout.
[4169.70s -> 4170.58s]  I remember this one.
[4170.58s -> 4171.38s]  I can do this one quick.
[4171.38s -> 4171.86s]  Okay.
[4171.86s -> 4173.46s]  Jess, this one...
[4173.46s -> 4174.18s]  I can do it on my own.
[4174.98s -> 4175.38s]  Okay.
[4175.38s -> 4175.94s]  Baked trout.
[4175.94s -> 4176.82s]  Remember, on my own.
[4177.38s -> 4184.57s]  I need a tray.
[4184.57s -> 4185.45s]  Where's the tray?
[4185.45s -> 4189.72s]  Where's the baking sheet?
[4189.72s -> 4190.36s]  Bingo.
[4190.36s -> 4190.92s]  Okay.
[4190.92s -> 4191.40s]  I need...
[4192.36s -> 4193.18s]  What do I need here?
[4193.18s -> 4193.82s]  I need...
[4193.82s -> 4194.14s]  I need...
[4194.14s -> 4194.70s]  Let me...
[4194.70s -> 4195.26s]  I need a...
[4195.26s -> 4195.90s]  How do I...
[4195.90s -> 4196.30s]  What?
[4196.30s -> 4197.18s]  Let me see.
[4197.18s -> 4200.98s]  How do I determine what I need?
[4200.98s -> 4205.08s]  I need salt and pepper, right?
[4205.08s -> 4206.36s]  Where's the thing to look at?
[4206.36s -> 4206.84s]  The salt...
[4206.84s -> 4207.24s]  Hold on.
[4207.24s -> 4207.64s]  Right here.
[4213.88s -> 4214.44s]  Pepper, thyme, dill.
[4215.69s -> 4216.73s]  Pepper, thyme, dill.
[4223.27s -> 4225.75s]  Two, three, four, five.
[4226.55s -> 4227.19s]  Get it on there.
[4227.19s -> 4227.67s]  Five.
[4227.67s -> 4227.83s]  Okay.
[4227.83s -> 4228.15s]  Come on.
[4230.25s -> 4230.57s]  Thyme.
[4239.70s -> 4242.14s]  Pepper.
[4242.14s -> 4243.50s]  Where's that black pepper?
[4243.50s -> 4244.74s]  That salt?
[4247.98s -> 4248.62s]  Oh, come on.
[4248.62s -> 4249.10s]  Where is it?
[4250.49s -> 4250.89s]  Right there.
[4254.73s -> 4256.57s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[4257.21s -> 4258.71s]  What's next?
[4259.72s -> 4259.96s]  Okay.
[4261.00s -> 4261.48s]  Baking tray.
[4261.48s -> 4262.44s]  Bake for 90 seconds.
[4262.44s -> 4263.48s]  Season with horseradish.
[4264.42s -> 4267.26s]  After?
[4267.26s -> 4268.63s]  After.
[4268.63s -> 4269.03s]  Okay.
[4269.03s -> 4269.51s]  90 seconds.
[4269.51s -> 4269.99s]  Get it in there.
[4282.54s -> 4283.10s]  Get it in.
[4285.34s -> 4288.02s]  This is still on.
[4289.98s -> 4291.10s]  I just burnt.
[4291.10s -> 4293.50s]  I just singed my fucking eyebrows.
[4299.34s -> 4300.78s]  Nice clown laugh, by the way.
[4301.98s -> 4304.26s]  All right.
[4304.26s -> 4306.82s]  Now I need lemon cut into quarters.
[4316.47s -> 4319.22s]  This is where I get a hold down shift.
[4319.22s -> 4319.62s]  Freeze.
[4320.18s -> 4323.05s]  Freeze product into quarters.
[4323.05s -> 4323.53s]  So here we go.
[4323.53s -> 4324.73s]  Let's get it nice and neat here.
[4328.12s -> 4335.74s]  Bang.
[4335.74s -> 4336.06s]  Bang.
[4342.04s -> 4343.13s]  Done.
[4343.13s -> 4343.85s]  90 seconds.
[4345.38s -> 4348.62s]  I need to see in there.
[4348.62s -> 4349.42s]  How long has it been?
[4349.42s -> 4353.77s]  Okay, it's almost done.
[4353.77s -> 4360.94s]  And then we need dried horseradish.
[4360.94s -> 4361.50s]  And then...
[4362.30s -> 4365.80s]  So get it on a plate.
[4365.80s -> 4367.56s]  Garnish with parsley leaves.
[4367.56s -> 4368.44s]  Six grams.
[4368.44s -> 4379.10s]  I need a plate.
[4379.10s -> 4384.70s]  Basic plate.
[4384.70s -> 4385.34s]  Is it done?
[4385.34s -> 4388.28s]  I'm burning my fucking hands.
[4391.53s -> 4392.09s]  No.
[4392.09s -> 4392.73s]  Hold on.
[4392.73s -> 4395.77s]  Just put it back in.
[4395.77s -> 4396.89s]  Just put it on the fucking table.
[4398.09s -> 4401.00s]  Jesus.
[4401.00s -> 4402.95s]  Horseradish first.
[4402.95s -> 4403.75s]  Five grams.
[4403.75s -> 4410.02s]  Get it on the plate.
[4415.94s -> 4417.38s]  Six grams of parsley.
[4417.38s -> 4418.50s]  Two, four, six.
[4421.50s -> 4428.10s]  Get those lemons on there.
[4428.18s -> 4428.82s]  Wait, I need to like...
[4431.30s -> 4432.26s]  Okay, that looks a little better.
[4432.98s -> 4433.38s]  Done.
[4433.38s -> 4433.78s]  Bingo.
[4447.50s -> 4458.14s]  What do you think?
[4458.14s -> 4459.26s]  I didn't have any help on that one.
[4459.26s -> 4459.98s]  Got them all perfect.
[4462.57s -> 4463.85s]  You got to hold the basics pretty quickly.
[4463.85s -> 4465.13s]  So what's the master plan, you might ask.
[4465.13s -> 4468.89s]  Well, I want this place to go from snow stars to five stars.
[4470.78s -> 4473.88s]  Not in the red today.
[4473.88s -> 4475.56s]  Each dish you serve affects our fame score.
[4475.56s -> 4476.68s]  Do well and the score goes up.
[4476.68s -> 4478.54s]  Mess up and we're going down.
[4478.54s -> 4479.74s]  I made 108 cents.
[4481.43s -> 4482.79s]  We need attractive food critic.
[4482.79s -> 4486.31s]  To do that, we have to meet a fame score quota at the end of the day.
[4488.09s -> 4488.73s]  And I did it.
[4490.65s -> 4491.21s]  I got to 30.
[4491.21s -> 4491.77s]  I got 34.
[4496.58s -> 4498.34s]  There's a food critic coming in at the end of today.
[4499.46s -> 4499.86s]  Already?
[4499.86s -> 4500.50s]  We just opened.
[4503.02s -> 4505.66s]  Going over the quota to have some breathing space just in case.
[4505.66s -> 4506.14s]  Yeah, I did.
[4506.78s -> 4510.02s]  A food critic wants to try your cooking tomorrow.
[4510.02s -> 4511.86s]  Impress him and we're guaranteed a fame star.
[4513.77s -> 4515.45s]  Once the critic is here, focus on his order.
[4515.45s -> 4517.85s]  Score at least four stars to pass his exam.
[4519.16s -> 4520.44s]  Tomorrow, we're getting inspected.
[4520.44s -> 4522.20s]  It's a great chance to raise our fame.
[4522.20s -> 4522.68s]  Be ready.
[4522.68s -> 4524.20s]  Well, I need to clean the kitchen.
[4524.92s -> 4530.22s]  Level up.
[4530.22s -> 4530.78s]  Skill point.
[4531.34s -> 4533.78s]  What do you think?
[4533.78s -> 4534.26s]  More money?
[4535.06s -> 4537.56s]  Yeah, I want 50% more money.
[4540.57s -> 4542.09s]  I think we should expand our menu.
[4542.09s -> 4543.69s]  Look at the dishes below and pick your favorite.
[4545.46s -> 4549.38s]  Pork chops with baked potatoes or simple Ukrainian borscht.
[4550.02s -> 4552.97s]  This takes nine minutes.
[4552.97s -> 4554.17s]  This takes seven.
[4554.17s -> 4555.86s]  Borscht?
[4563.56s -> 4566.68s]  Chicken broth, salt, black pepper, beetroot, onion, carrot, parsley.
[4566.68s -> 4567.80s]  Boil for 120 seconds.
[4568.44s -> 4571.42s]  I can handle this.
[4572.70s -> 4573.42s]  Yeah, let's get it.
[4579.10s -> 4580.22s]  Beetroot is our new ingredient.
[4580.22s -> 4586.15s]  You'll find it in the shop and the larder.
[4586.15s -> 4587.11s]  Carrot is a new ingredient.
[4587.11s -> 4588.31s]  You find it in the shop and the larder.
[4589.77s -> 4590.17s]  Parsley.
[4590.17s -> 4591.61s]  It can be found both in the shop and the larder.
[4591.61s -> 4592.49s]  Yeah, I got new ingredients.
[4593.13s -> 4594.28s]  All right, good.
[4594.28s -> 4595.00s]  Okay, I got time.
[4595.00s -> 4595.64s]  I got three minutes.
[4596.20s -> 4598.15s]  Someone's coming to investigate this place.
[4598.79s -> 4599.75s]  We got to clean this up now.
[4600.47s -> 4608.62s]  Within an hour.
[4608.62s -> 4611.14s]  There's no faster.
[4611.14s -> 4612.34s]  I can't drag this over here.
[4614.17s -> 4615.69s]  Food critic's going to be here in three hours.
[4615.69s -> 4616.17s]  Just mop.
[4616.73s -> 4628.50s]  We're getting health inspected.
[4629.62s -> 4630.18s]  Anything else?
[4630.18s -> 4631.78s]  The fridge has been open all night.
[4631.78s -> 4632.26s]  That's great.
[4632.98s -> 4633.85s]  Okay, I got to...
[4634.73s -> 4635.69s]  How do I clean up that?
[4636.33s -> 4637.45s]  I don't think I can reach this.
[4640.57s -> 4641.37s]  Move vertically.
[4643.54s -> 4644.02s]  Rotate.
[4644.66s -> 4646.87s]  I can't get it in there.
[4652.39s -> 4653.27s]  Advanced controls.
[4653.27s -> 4653.99s]  Move vertically.
[4655.35s -> 4656.47s]  They can't do anything about it.
[4656.47s -> 4656.95s]  Rotate.
[4657.91s -> 4658.71s]  Move vertically.
[4660.36s -> 4660.76s]  Sponge.
[4661.40s -> 4664.84s]  Utensils?
[4665.48s -> 4666.44s]  Oh my goodness.
[4667.78s -> 4668.34s]  Spatula.
[4668.34s -> 4668.66s]  Bucket.
[4668.66s -> 4669.06s]  Sponge.
[4679.10s -> 4679.90s]  How do I use it?
[4681.13s -> 4681.61s]  Rotate.
[4681.61s -> 4682.01s]  Throw.
[4682.01s -> 4682.89s]  Advanced controls.
[4682.89s -> 4683.45s]  Rotate.
[4683.45s -> 4683.77s]  Drop.
[4684.33s -> 4688.70s]  I didn't even know you could crouch in the game.
[4694.39s -> 4694.63s]  Good.
[4696.60s -> 4697.16s]  Clean that up.
[4703.10s -> 4703.42s]  Good.
[4703.42s -> 4703.82s]  Anything else?
[4703.82s -> 4704.38s]  What else?
[4704.38s -> 4705.42s]  There's shit all over here too.
[4708.60s -> 4710.04s]  It's the Mr. Clean Magic Eraser.
[4715.06s -> 4715.38s]  All right.
[4715.38s -> 4716.90s]  I had fucking three sponges already.
[4716.90s -> 4717.46s]  Great.
[4717.46s -> 4718.02s]  Fantastic.
[4718.02s -> 4718.26s]  Okay.
[4719.22s -> 4720.34s]  Time to open.
[4720.34s -> 4720.98s]  44 seconds.
[4720.98s -> 4721.30s]  What else?
[4721.30s -> 4722.42s]  We got anything else?
[4722.42s -> 4726.28s]  I got to make things a little nicer in here.
[4727.35s -> 4728.87s]  Just get it ready for the day.
[4731.21s -> 4731.69s]  What about...
[4733.62s -> 4734.66s]  This oven's been on.
[4734.66s -> 4735.30s]  I can clean the oven.
[4735.30s -> 4735.86s]  Turn the oven off.
[4741.30s -> 4741.86s]  Clean.
[4741.86s -> 4742.02s]  What?
[4742.02s -> 4742.66s]  I can't clean it?
[4743.22s -> 4743.46s]  Clean.
[4746.09s -> 4747.45s]  What the fuck is going on?
[4748.33s -> 4749.93s]  Why am I wiping the tile?
[4751.53s -> 4752.49s]  How do I zoom out?
[4761.80s -> 4763.08s]  What the hell is happening?
[4769.77s -> 4770.09s]  Okay.
[4770.09s -> 4770.89s]  I can...
[4770.89s -> 4771.45s]  New order.
[4777.56s -> 4778.52s]  Chicken broth.
[4778.52s -> 4778.84s]  Salt.
[4779.72s -> 4780.60s]  Pour the liquid...
[4780.60s -> 4780.76s]  Okay.
[4780.76s -> 4781.72s]  So I just need a...
[4781.72s -> 4783.82s]  I just need a big pot.
[4783.82s -> 4785.50s]  A thousand milliliters of chicken broth.
[4787.21s -> 4787.69s]  Pot.
[4787.69s -> 4788.57s]  Big one.
[4788.57s -> 4790.84s]  Is this clean?
[4791.40s -> 4794.66s]  It's clean.
[4794.66s -> 4794.98s]  It's clean.
[4794.98s -> 4795.54s]  It's clean, right?
[4796.73s -> 4797.45s]  That looks pretty clean.
[4798.01s -> 4798.55s]  All right.
[4798.55s -> 4799.11s]  Get it on here.
[4799.67s -> 4800.25s]  Here we go.
[4800.25s -> 4800.57s]  Here we go.
[4800.57s -> 4800.89s]  Here we go.
[4802.66s -> 4803.70s]  Chicken broth.
[4803.70s -> 4810.20s]  What?
[4810.20s -> 4810.52s]  Oh shit.
[4810.52s -> 4811.00s]  It's empty.
[4814.18s -> 4814.58s]  Buy one.
[4815.22s -> 4825.42s]  What's a...
[4825.42s -> 4826.86s]  What's a thousand minus 164?
[4832.73s -> 4833.21s]  Three.
[4833.21s -> 4833.93s]  Okay.
[4833.93s -> 4843.37s]  Oh fucking perfect!
[4844.23s -> 4845.11s]  It was perfect!

[4853.13s -> 4853.37s]  Pepper.
[4853.37s -> 4854.17s]  20 grams.
[4854.17s -> 4863.98s]  Let's go.
[4863.98s -> 4864.78s]  Salt right here, right?
[4866.02s -> 4866.98s]  20 grams.
[4866.98s -> 4876.62s]  What's next?
[4876.62s -> 4877.98s]  I need beetroot.
[4877.98s -> 4878.78s]  600 grams.
[4878.78s -> 4879.10s]  Onion.
[4879.10s -> 4879.58s]  Beetroot.

[4891.08s -> 4891.80s]  Put that beet in here.

[4937.96s -> 4938.28s]  What was it?
[4938.28s -> 4940.60s]  What was the parsley?
[4940.60s -> 4941.00s]  80.
[4943.46s -> 4943.70s]  Wait.
[4946.26s -> 4947.06s]  80?
[4947.06s -> 4956.09s]  Am I insane?
[4956.09s -> 4956.73s]  That's a lot.
[4961.50s -> 4962.78s]  Is there a dried parsley?
[4973.26s -> 4975.58s]  There's no dried parsley.
[4975.58s -> 4983.00s]  What is it?
[4983.00s -> 4983.24s]  How many?
[4983.24s -> 4983.88s]  Was this 80?
[4983.88s -> 4984.44s]  What is this one?
[4986.28s -> 4994.15s]  80.
[4994.15s -> 4997.74s]  Okay.
[4997.74s -> 4999.74s]  Boil for 120 seconds.
[4999.74s -> 5002.17s]  That's it.
[5002.17s -> 5005.51s]  Let's go.
[5005.51s -> 5005.75s]  Timer.
[5005.75s -> 5011.29s]  Where's the timer?
[5011.29s -> 5013.91s]  Q.

[5014.55s -> 5021.37s]  It's got to be more like...
[5021.37s -> 5021.69s]  All right.
[5021.69s -> 5022.89s]  How much time do I have?
[5022.89s -> 5024.17s]  Oh, it's gonna be close.
[5024.17s -> 5034.42s]  That's kind of weird to do like Q-A-S-E-D.
[5034.42s -> 5034.74s]  All right.
[5035.54s -> 5036.50s]  Let's cool it down.

[5038.07s -> 5038.31s]  Wait.
[5038.31s -> 5038.55s]  What?
[5038.55s -> 5039.43s]  Did that just cost money?
[5046.98s -> 5048.02s]  I can't put it back.
[5048.02s -> 5048.42s]  All right.

[5066.70s -> 5068.70s]  The onions are almost done
[5068.70s -> 5070.14s]  and then I have to turn the heat off, right?
[5070.14s -> 5072.86s]  Do I have to grind this up?
[5072.86s -> 5077.35s]  Do I turn the heat off?
[5077.35s -> 5104.20s]  All right.
[5104.20s -> 5105.16s]  We're good.
[5105.16s -> 5116.92s]  I think I might have fucked it up.
[5116.92s -> 5119.64s]  It's cooking for like three times the length.
[5119.64s -> 5122.09s]  Take it off the heat.
[5122.09s -> 5122.65s]  No.
[5122.65s -> 5124.10s]  It's not done.
[5124.10s -> 5131.10s]  Where's my plate?

[5154.84s -> 5155.48s]  This way.
[5155.48s -> 5165.32s]  How much soup is soup?

[5174.73s -> 5177.93s]  into the trash.
[5177.93s -> 5178.81s]  Oh my fucking god.

[5214.01s -> 5214.57s]  What?
[5214.57s -> 5216.41s]  I mean too much.
[5219.56s -> 5220.28s]  It was the same.
[5220.28s -> 5223.35s]  It was the right amount.
[5223.35s -> 5224.55s]  Dude, that's hard to pour.
[5225.99s -> 5226.31s]  All right.

[5234.55s -> 5243.70s]  We need that pot.
[5243.78s -> 5245.62s]  Just watering down the soup.
[5245.62s -> 5246.66s]  Is there any water?
[5246.66s -> 5247.54s]  You want water?
[5247.54s -> 5249.94s]  This is how we save money in the restaurant business.

[5653.67s -> 5655.03s]  Everybody could laugh.
[5655.03s -> 5662.01s]  Fucking feels good when you do a perfect water.
[5662.01s -> 5662.97s]  A thousand.
[5665.59s -> 5666.23s]  Don't even look at it.

[5811.70s -> 5813.72s]  Plate.
[5813.72s -> 5814.20s]  Where's the plate?
[5814.84s -> 5821.43s]  Do I not have any money to buy a plate?
[5832.89s -> 5834.57s]  What the fuck am I supposed to do about this?
[5841.99s -> 5864.18s]  Um, all right.
[5864.18s -> 5865.62s]  But that wasn't even my fault.
[5865.62s -> 5870.07s]  The thing fucking disappeared.
[5870.07s -> 5872.71s]  I lost my pan and now I can't get another one.
[5872.71s -> 5883.38s]  There's another order.
[5883.38s -> 5884.42s]  Yeah, but I can't even get it.
[5884.42s -> 5885.94s]  I can't even buy a plate.
[5885.94s -> 5896.97s]  Just serve it in the pan.
[5896.97s -> 5898.49s]  Can I even do that?
[5898.49s -> 5914.71s]  They do that at hipster restaurants.
[5914.71s -> 5915.59s]  That's true.
[5915.59s -> 5923.50s]  Let's see if this works.
[5926.66s -> 5928.34s]  Why are people taking the plates home?
[5928.34s -> 5929.14s]  Yeah, that's weird.
[5935.27s -> 5936.07s]  No, I can't even.
[5941.54s -> 5943.86s]  Like, I need, I don't even have four cents.
[5945.37s -> 5946.25s]  What the fuck?
[5946.81s -> 5949.22s]  I have to redo today.
[5949.22s -> 5949.78s]  This is not fair.
[5949.78s -> 5951.30s]  Can I like redo the day?
[5951.30s -> 5960.92s]  Yeah, I'll give you a fucking restaurant.
[5960.92s -> 5965.91s]  How does this sound?
[5965.91s -> 5967.59s]  Quit fucking beeping at me.
[5967.59s -> 5977.62s]  It's too hot to pick up.
[5977.62s -> 5977.86s]  All right.
[5981.78s -> 5982.74s]  When was this saved?
[5992.01s -> 5993.13s]  23 minutes ago.
[5997.00s -> 5997.24s]  All right.
[5997.24s -> 5999.83s]  This time I hope the stove doesn't eat my...
[6002.57s -> 6003.93s]  Oh my god.
[6003.93s -> 6014.12s]  I have to do the whole day again.
[6014.12s -> 6015.72s]  Why did it eat my pan though?
[6016.95s -> 6018.95s]  It just deleted my fucking pan.
[6018.95s -> 6019.93s]  All right.
[6019.93s -> 6022.23s]  I'm upset about that.
[6022.23s -> 6023.83s]  I'm gonna get this shit ready now.
[6023.83s -> 6026.90s]  So I don't have to not have enough money to buy.
[6026.90s -> 6027.14s]  All right.
[6027.14s -> 6027.78s]  Here we go.
[6029.96s -> 6030.28s]  All right.
[6030.28s -> 6036.42s]  Prep day.
[6036.42s -> 6038.34s]  I did so good on that first fish too.
[6038.34s -> 6038.58s]  All right.
[6038.58s -> 6044.30s]  Let's get the spices in the right place.
[6044.30s -> 6044.86s]  Spatula.
[6044.86s -> 6046.65s]  Hang it up.
[6046.65s -> 6047.62s]  Blender.
[6047.62s -> 6048.65s]  Hang it up.
[6048.65s -> 6049.61s]  We'll just put it right there.
[6049.61s -> 6051.78s]  That's fine.
[6051.78s -> 6056.44s]  We need fresh chicken broth.
[6056.44s -> 6057.56s]  We need fresh sour cream.
[6061.96s -> 6063.32s]  We need fresh tomatoes.
[6063.32s -> 6064.04s]  I got the plates.
[6065.42s -> 6066.30s]  Is there any dirt?
[6066.30s -> 6070.06s]  Let's go with chicken broth.
[6071.26s -> 6072.70s]  Let's get it over here.
[6075.29s -> 6075.93s]  What if you fool?
[6075.93s -> 6076.17s]  What?
[6076.73s -> 6079.67s]  This is why I don't have any money.
[6083.74s -> 6084.46s]  Well, I can, I...
[6084.46s -> 6088.97s]  Well, it's a new day.
[6088.97s -> 6095.54s]  Just relax.
[6095.54s -> 6096.26s]  That looks good.
[6096.82s -> 6097.93s]  Anything else?
[6097.93s -> 6099.13s]  Any of those things I need to clean up?
[6099.69s -> 6100.49s]  I got plenty of time.
[6107.13s -> 6109.21s]  Just use the spilled oil.
[6109.21s -> 6109.85s]  Oh my god.
[6109.85s -> 6110.89s]  That's fucking revolting.
[6114.50s -> 6114.82s]  All right.
[6114.82s -> 6116.66s]  No spills today.
[6116.66s -> 6118.18s]  I'm gonna be ready completely.
[6118.18s -> 6120.98s]  Is the oven still on?
[6121.54s -> 6124.95s]  This looks like shit.
[6124.95s -> 6127.91s]  And oven's on.
[6127.91s -> 6129.82s]  Turn it off.
[6129.82s -> 6131.74s]  I think I broke the oven by leaving it on all day.
[6131.74s -> 6132.46s]  So how much time I got?
[6133.10s -> 6134.39s]  45 seconds to get the pot.
[6135.58s -> 6136.70s]  Let's get the pot right here.
[6137.98s -> 6138.54s]  My spices.
[6138.54s -> 6139.50s]  Get them on the right spot.
[6140.06s -> 6142.92s]  This is gonna be clean today.
[6146.33s -> 6146.65s]  Salt.
[6146.65s -> 6147.05s]  Where's the...
[6147.61s -> 6148.25s]  There's the bowls.
[6148.25s -> 6149.13s]  There's plates.
[6149.13s -> 6149.77s]  Cutting board.
[6150.78s -> 6151.42s]  Nice spot.
[6151.42s -> 6151.74s]  All right.
[6151.74s -> 6152.70s]  Get it on the right area.
[6155.80s -> 6156.52s]  Use the radio.
[6156.52s -> 6156.76s]  All right.
[6156.76s -> 6157.40s]  Hold on.
[6157.40s -> 6159.51s]  There's no time for the radio right now.
[6159.51s -> 6165.37s]  I got my seasonings.
[6165.37s -> 6166.01s]  I got my spices.
[6166.01s -> 6166.73s]  I got my knife.
[6167.45s -> 6170.33s]  I got 11 seconds to turn the radio on.
[6172.49s -> 6173.93s]  Now playing on cheesy FM.
[6174.57s -> 6175.77s]  Cooking satay.
[6180.54s -> 6180.94s]  All right.
[6180.94s -> 6181.34s]  That...
[6181.34s -> 6182.86s]  I told you to get classical music.
[6182.86s -> 6183.26s]  That's fine.
[6184.79s -> 6185.19s]  New order.
[6185.19s -> 6185.51s]  Here we go.
[6186.39s -> 6187.19s]  Thousand chicken broth.
[6187.19s -> 6187.59s]  Salt.
[6187.59s -> 6187.91s]  Pepper.
[6188.47s -> 6190.23s]  Into the pot.
[6202.25s -> 6202.73s]  One.
[6202.73s -> 6203.29s]  Two.
[6203.29s -> 6203.61s]  Three.
[6204.25s -> 6205.59s]  Almost.
[6208.14s -> 6208.62s]  Come on, come on.
[6208.62s -> 6209.18s]  Clean it up.
[6209.18s -> 6209.66s]  Come on.
[6209.66s -> 6210.30s]  A little bit more.
[6210.30s -> 6210.62s]  Come on.
[6210.62s -> 6211.18s]  Clean it up.
[6212.58s -> 6213.06s]  That's good.
[6213.06s -> 6213.46s]  Perfect.
[6213.46s -> 6214.66s]  Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[6214.66s -> 6215.38s]  Salt, pepper, right?
[6215.94s -> 6217.03s]  There's my salt.
[6217.03s -> 6217.67s]  There's my pepper.
[6219.67s -> 6225.19s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.
[6225.83s -> 6227.35s]  In the hall of the mountain king?
[6229.00s -> 6229.96s]  This is the Lord of the Rings?
[6230.52s -> 6240.82s]  I think it was already content ID claimed because I don't hear it.
[6240.82s -> 6244.52s]  Yeah.
[6244.52s -> 6247.88s]  Okay.
[6247.88s -> 6248.44s]  What was next?
[6249.53s -> 6253.85s]  Next is beetroot, onion, carrot, parsley.
[6254.57s -> 6258.07s]  Beetroot.
[6258.07s -> 6258.55s]  Onion.
[6258.55s -> 6258.79s]  Carrot.
[6258.79s -> 6259.75s]  Let me get the onion.
[6261.24s -> 6261.72s]  Beetroot.
[6262.36s -> 6263.46s]  What was it?
[6264.18s -> 6264.90s]  Five.
[6264.90s -> 6266.02s]  It was five of these, right?
[6266.02s -> 6266.90s]  What about parsley?
[6266.90s -> 6267.86s]  It was one parsley.
[6270.89s -> 6271.45s]  Five of these.
[6277.75s -> 6280.01s]  And was there a carrot, too?
[6280.89s -> 6285.06s]  Beetroot, onion, it was one carrot.
[6285.06s -> 6286.18s]  No, yeah, it was one carrot.
[6286.98s -> 6295.35s]  Okay, here we go.
[6298.70s -> 6299.26s]  Boil it up.
[6300.76s -> 6301.80s]  Boil for 120 seconds.
[6302.44s -> 6303.64s]  I need to blend it, too, don't I?
[6304.28s -> 6305.93s]  It doesn't say to blend.
[6306.49s -> 6308.84s]  I mean, it doesn't say blend.
[6309.40s -> 6314.60s]  So just boil it for 120 seconds.
[6314.68s -> 6316.76s]  And then deep, deep plate.
[6317.48s -> 6319.06s]  And I'm good.
[6327.37s -> 6328.41s]  I haven't been counting any time.
[6332.81s -> 6333.69s]  How many seconds has it been?
[6334.33s -> 6340.82s]  Okay, let's clean up.
[6340.82s -> 6341.14s]  Clean up.
[6341.14s -> 6341.78s]  Clean up as we go.
[6343.06s -> 6344.98s]  Chicken broth, there's nothing in there.
[6344.98s -> 6346.62s]  I think I need another one of these, right?
[6352.84s -> 6354.20s]  Every chef will tell you clean as you go.
[6359.56s -> 6360.76s]  Onions are cooked.
[6360.76s -> 6363.19s]  That was less than one milliliter in there.
[6363.19s -> 6364.07s]  I didn't waste money.
[6367.62s -> 6370.10s]  Okay, the onions are cooked.
[6370.10s -> 6372.26s]  The parsley, everything else needs to cook.
[6381.00s -> 6382.20s]  And then just pour it into here.
[6388.25s -> 6395.40s]  Onions are getting a little crunchy.
[6398.95s -> 6399.51s]  Okay, that's it.
[6400.15s -> 6406.31s]  Get it in the bowl.
[6406.31s -> 6418.52s]  It was 300, right?
[6418.52s -> 6420.36s]  Only like 40 something more.
[6420.36s -> 6421.08s]  Just a little bit.
[6421.08s -> 6422.04s]  Just a little bit.
[6422.04s -> 6422.76s]  That's close enough.
[6423.64s -> 6424.84s]  I don't think I can get 10 from this.
[6425.64s -> 6428.81s]  Oh, whatever.
[6428.81s -> 6429.37s]  You get extra.
[6431.08s -> 6432.52s]  Happy fucking birthday.
[6436.28s -> 6440.74s]  That's all right.
[6440.74s -> 6441.14s]  Not bad.
[6444.79s -> 6447.67s]  Complaints were it was too much pepper.
[6448.39s -> 6449.11s]  Too much salt.
[6449.83s -> 6450.84s]  Wasn't it?
[6450.84s -> 6451.96s]  It's too much.
[6451.96s -> 6453.08s]  It was 20 and 20, right?
[6456.18s -> 6456.90s]  All right, quiet.
[6459.53s -> 6460.49s]  Here comes the critic, right?
[6461.50s -> 6462.78s]  I got everything I need.
[6462.78s -> 6463.50s]  I got the plate.
[6464.22s -> 6464.94s]  Here comes the fish.
[6467.77s -> 6469.13s]  Pepper, thyme, dill, trout.
[6469.69s -> 6477.64s]  No, wait, no.
[6477.64s -> 6478.52s]  Get in one of the trays.
[6480.68s -> 6481.56s]  Get in there.
[6481.56s -> 6485.08s]  In case somebody orders this again, just leave it on here.
[6486.66s -> 6487.70s]  Pepper, thyme, dill, trout.
[6487.70s -> 6488.74s]  Pepper, thyme, dill, trout.
[6488.74s -> 6489.46s]  Pepper, thyme, dill.
[6489.46s -> 6490.10s]  Pepper, thyme, dill.
[6490.10s -> 6490.98s]  Pepper, thyme, dill, dill.
[6491.62s -> 6498.39s]  I need one more.
[6499.51s -> 6502.01s]  Got it.
[6502.01s -> 6507.40s]  Pepper, thyme, pepper, dill.
[6507.40s -> 6508.12s]  Pepper, thyme, dill.
[6508.84s -> 6513.72s]  Come on.
[6513.72s -> 6516.71s]  Pepper, thyme, dill, trout.
[6516.71s -> 6517.27s]  Pepper, thyme.
[6526.68s -> 6527.40s]  All right.
[6527.40s -> 6527.80s]  That's it.
[6528.52s -> 6529.08s]  Baking tray.
[6529.08s -> 6529.64s]  Put it in baking.
[6529.64s -> 6530.20s]  90 seconds.
[6532.46s -> 6533.50s]  God damn it.
[6533.50s -> 6534.86s]  I fucking can't believe it.
[6534.86s -> 6537.50s]  You can't run every fucking time.
[6539.59s -> 6540.15s]  90 seconds.
[6540.79s -> 6549.18s]  Let's do 80.
[6549.18s -> 6552.01s]  Let's do like just that.
[6552.01s -> 6553.13s]  I can come back and look.
[6553.13s -> 6557.96s]  Okay, they got the plate.
[6557.96s -> 6559.72s]  Now we got the potatoes.
[6560.36s -> 6562.95s]  No, the lemon.
[6562.95s -> 6563.91s]  It's not potatoes, it's lemon.
[6563.91s -> 6564.31s]  Lemon, lemon.
[6564.31s -> 6565.11s]  One lemon quartered.
[6565.75s -> 6571.59s]  Here we go.
[6572.23s -> 6572.87s]  Freeze time.
[6573.43s -> 6577.86s]  Pretty good technique.
[6577.86s -> 6578.18s]  All right.
[6578.18s -> 6578.42s]  Good.
[6578.98s -> 6579.70s]  Wait for the fish.
[6580.26s -> 6585.38s]  Need a plate.
[6585.38s -> 6586.42s]  And then we need fresh parsley.
[6586.42s -> 6587.38s]  Six grams.
[6587.38s -> 6596.60s]  How you doing in there?
[6596.60s -> 6599.19s]  Pretty good.
[6599.19s -> 6601.94s]  Just get the parsley on it now.
[6601.94s -> 6602.58s]  Because who cares?
[6609.48s -> 6611.00s]  I swear to God.
[6611.00s -> 6612.49s]  Fucking Burger King.
[6613.13s -> 6618.98s]  I don't want to run.
[6618.98s -> 6620.34s]  There's a perk to run faster.
[6620.34s -> 6621.46s]  Why the fuck would I want that?
[6622.34s -> 6624.90s]  Oh, right, right, right, right.
[6627.51s -> 6628.07s]  Is done?
[6628.07s -> 6628.47s]  Not yet.
[6629.11s -> 6649.70s]  That was horseradish.
[6649.70s -> 6652.31s]  Where is it?
[6652.31s -> 6660.26s]  It's the yellow one.
[6660.26s -> 6660.98s]  Five.
[6660.98s -> 6662.95s]  Is this five on there?
[6662.95s -> 6663.51s]  I didn't see it.
[6663.51s -> 6664.23s]  Was it five?
[6664.23s -> 6665.11s]  Tell me quick.
[6665.11s -> 6666.23s]  Was it five?
[6666.23s -> 6667.10s]  Was it four?
[6670.60s -> 6671.16s]  Good.
[6671.16s -> 6679.21s]  Fucking parsley's on the ground.
[6681.05s -> 6682.09s]  All right, here you go.
[6683.13s -> 6684.17s]  Yummy.
[6684.17s -> 6685.61s]  I can't wait for you to try this.
[6686.25s -> 6689.35s]  I've dropped everything.
[6689.99s -> 6693.22s]  You can't tell the difference though.
[6693.22s -> 6693.78s]  Forty-eight.
[6693.78s -> 6694.74s]  That's better than yesterday.
[6695.74s -> 6696.54s]  No complaints at all.
[6697.26s -> 6701.61s]  All right.
[6701.61s -> 6702.25s]  I still have that.
[6702.97s -> 6703.46s]  Easy.
[6704.18s -> 6705.59s]  New order, huh?
[6707.08s -> 6707.80s]  Done.
[6707.80s -> 6731.75s]  I'm gonna be shocked to how fucking quick this one comes out.
[6732.39s -> 6737.27s]  Take it.
[6737.27s -> 6742.98s]  It was still hot.
[6748.26s -> 6749.14s]  Too much salt.
[6749.14s -> 6749.94s]  Did we...
[6749.94s -> 6750.82s]  Did I put...
[6750.82s -> 6753.54s]  No, I had exactly a thousand chicken broth in there.
[6759.61s -> 6760.25s]  Two col...
[6760.25s -> 6761.77s]  How many orders do I have to do here?
[6761.77s -> 6762.41s]  Tomato soup.
[6762.97s -> 6763.21s]  Fuck.
[6763.77s -> 6765.90s]  Okay, tomato soup is...
[6768.50s -> 6769.38s]  Seven hundred.
[6769.38s -> 6770.02s]  Twelve, twelve.
[6775.11s -> 6776.63s]  Seven hundred, twelve, twelve.
[6776.63s -> 6777.27s]  Seven hundred.
[6778.23s -> 6778.79s]  Chicken broth.
[6778.79s -> 6779.59s]  Where's my chicken broth?
[6779.59s -> 6780.39s]  Is it still any in there?
[6781.19s -> 6781.43s]  No.
[6787.19s -> 6788.07s]  Seven hundred.
[6788.07s -> 6810.63s]  Come on.
[6810.63s -> 6811.83s]  Okay, twelve, twelve.
[6811.83s -> 6812.47s]  Pepper.
[6812.47s -> 6812.79s]  Salt.
[6819.19s -> 6819.51s]  Twelve.
[6820.07s -> 6820.63s]  Black pepper.
[6829.62s -> 6830.58s]  Twelve.
[6830.58s -> 6831.30s]  All right.
[6831.30s -> 6832.07s]  Here we go.
[6832.63s -> 6835.90s]  And we need six cayenne.
[6835.90s -> 6836.46s]  Tomatoes.
[6836.46s -> 6837.98s]  Eight tomatoes and one onion.
[6837.98s -> 6854.60s]  Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[6855.42s -> 6856.38s]  And then one onion, right?
[6856.38s -> 6856.94s]  Was it an onion?
[6856.94s -> 6857.58s]  It was an onion, right?
[6857.58s -> 6858.14s]  It was one onion?
[6858.14s -> 6858.62s]  It was an onion.
[6861.27s -> 6861.43s]  C.
[6861.43s -> 6866.95s]  What do you mean C?
[6866.95s -> 6867.11s]  What?
[6867.11s -> 6867.67s]  What's the matter?
[6868.31s -> 6869.99s]  Is it just too big on the screen?
[6869.99s -> 6870.79s]  What do I do?
[6870.79s -> 6871.03s]  Bun?
[6872.39s -> 6873.83s]  Boil for sixty seconds and then blend.
[6873.83s -> 6874.39s]  Sixty seconds.
[6874.39s -> 6875.11s]  Timer.
[6875.11s -> 6875.67s]  Fifty seconds.
[6881.72s -> 6882.28s]  Then blend it.
[6885.62s -> 6886.42s]  Add sour cream.
[6886.42s -> 6887.30s]  Sour cream.
[6887.30s -> 6897.69s]  I'm ready.
[6897.69s -> 6898.33s]  We did it.
[6898.97s -> 6903.27s]  Hello?
[6903.83s -> 6907.61s]  All right.
[6907.61s -> 6908.89s]  I'm on a new station.
[6908.89s -> 6913.90s]  All right.
[6913.90s -> 6914.62s]  We'll keep the jazz.
[6915.18s -> 6920.34s]  This sounds like a song being played in reverse.
[6926.94s -> 6927.66s]  All right.
[6927.66s -> 6928.71s]  Here we go.
[6928.71s -> 6929.27s]  Turn this off.
[6929.83s -> 6933.91s]  Blend it up.
[6933.91s -> 6941.85s]  Done.
[6941.85s -> 6942.89s]  Turn off the heat.
[6942.89s -> 6945.75s]  Okay, done.
[6945.75s -> 6946.71s]  Add sour cream.
[6946.71s -> 6953.54s]  How much sour cream was it?
[6953.54s -> 6954.42s]  How much sour cream was it?
[6954.42s -> 6956.10s]  I just got fucking completely blanked.
[6956.10s -> 6957.61s]  How much sour cream?
[6957.61s -> 6959.22s]  One fifty.
[6959.22s -> 6962.30s]  How much is in there now?
[6962.30s -> 6962.78s]  That's enough.
[6971.35s -> 6971.91s]  Where's my bowl?
[6992.18s -> 6993.62s]  It's so hard to pour that.
[6993.70s -> 6994.58s]  I'm buying a ladle.
[6998.18s -> 6998.82s]  It's impossible.
[7004.98s -> 7005.78s]  Sixty-four to thirty.
[7005.78s -> 7009.22s]  I'm doing better than I was.
[7009.22s -> 7010.66s]  Not enough sour cream.
[7010.66s -> 7012.39s]  I thought it's too much.
[7015.05s -> 7015.53s]  We good?
[7018.14s -> 7021.08s]  Does anybody think that I'm like stuck in an infinite loop here?
[7021.08s -> 7024.42s]  Isn't this day two?
[7024.42s -> 7025.14s]  Salmon fillet.
[7025.14s -> 7027.13s]  Salt and pepper.
[7027.13s -> 7027.61s]  Save the game.
[7046.33s -> 7046.65s]  All right.
[7046.65s -> 7047.37s]  Salmon.
[7047.37s -> 7048.17s]  So salt and pepper.
[7048.17s -> 7049.11s]  Yeah.
[7049.11s -> 7050.39s]  I need that pan.
[7050.39s -> 7050.55s]  Okay.
[7050.55s -> 7051.99s]  This is where I fucked up last time.
[7051.99s -> 7052.63s]  I threw...
[7053.91s -> 7055.51s]  I fucked up everything from the very beginning.
[7057.18s -> 7060.14s]  Throwing away the pan in the very beginning was the worst thing ever.
[7060.70s -> 7062.34s]  Okay.
[7062.34s -> 7062.98s]  Pan.
[7062.98s -> 7063.30s]  Oil.
[7064.66s -> 7068.90s]  We have salmon fillet and five for both salt and pepper.
[7069.62s -> 7073.80s]  These are so expensive.
[7086.34s -> 7086.66s]  Salt.
[7086.66s -> 7087.06s]  Pepper.
[7087.70s -> 7091.13s]  Okay.
[7091.13s -> 7091.53s]  Get in there.
[7092.33s -> 7092.73s]  Three.
[7092.73s -> 7093.05s]  Four.
[7093.05s -> 7093.37s]  Five.
[7095.43s -> 7095.75s]  Salt.
[7095.75s -> 7096.63s]  Pepper.
[7096.63s -> 7097.75s]  And then we need to oil the pan.
[7098.76s -> 7099.48s]  Sunflower oil.
[7099.48s -> 7105.90s]  Salmon fillet.
[7105.90s -> 7107.42s]  Ten milliliters only.
[7115.26s -> 7115.58s]  All right.
[7115.58s -> 7116.22s]  Hold on.
[7116.22s -> 7117.26s]  Let's get the other thing going.
[7117.26s -> 7118.62s]  We need boiled potatoes.
[7120.06s -> 7120.86s]  Don't get rid of that.
[7120.86s -> 7121.82s]  There's still soup in there.
[7122.30s -> 7127.94s]  How did that not go in the fucking sink?
[7127.94s -> 7128.90s]  Fuck you, sink.
[7129.30s -> 7129.78s]  All right.
[7129.78s -> 7130.50s]  Boiled potatoes.
[7130.50s -> 7131.46s]  Thousand water, right?
[7138.04s -> 7138.76s]  Okay.
[7138.76s -> 7143.13s]  Twenty.
[7143.13s -> 7145.37s]  I have salt and then potatoes.
[7145.37s -> 7146.17s]  Let's get the salt in there.
[7146.97s -> 7151.16s]  One.
[7151.16s -> 7151.48s]  Two.
[7151.48s -> 7151.80s]  Three.
[7151.80s -> 7152.12s]  Four.
[7152.12s -> 7152.36s]  Five.
[7152.36s -> 7152.60s]  Six.
[7152.60s -> 7152.92s]  Seven.
[7152.92s -> 7153.16s]  Eight.
[7153.16s -> 7153.40s]  Nine.
[7153.40s -> 7153.64s]  Ten.
[7153.64s -> 7153.96s]  Eleven.
[7153.96s -> 7154.20s]  Twelve.
[7154.20s -> 7154.52s]  Thirty.
[7154.52s -> 7154.76s]  Forty.
[7154.76s -> 7155.00s]  Fifty.
[7155.00s -> 7155.32s]  Six.
[7155.32s -> 7155.64s]  Seven.
[7155.64s -> 7155.88s]  Eight.
[7155.88s -> 7156.28s]  Nine.
[7156.28s -> 7156.60s]  Twenty.
[7158.65s -> 7159.29s]  All right.
[7159.29s -> 7159.85s]  Potatoes.
[7159.85s -> 7160.89s]  How many potatoes?
[7160.89s -> 7161.13s]  Two.
[7161.69s -> 7164.55s]  That's a lemon.
[7164.55s -> 7165.51s]  That's not a potato.
[7167.10s -> 7167.50s]  Boiled.
[7168.14s -> 7176.70s]  Here we go.
[7176.70s -> 7177.70s]  One.
[7177.70s -> 7178.79s]  Two.
[7178.79s -> 7179.03s]  Three.
[7179.93s -> 7180.17s]  Four.
[7183.35s -> 7183.59s]  Ten.
[7184.31s -> 7184.63s]  Eleven.
[7201.85s -> 7202.57s]  120 seconds.
[7202.57s -> 7204.09s]  Boiled for 120 seconds.
[7204.09s -> 7207.05s]  Okay.
[7207.05s -> 7208.09s]  Looking good.
[7209.86s -> 7211.22s]  Flip it with my spatula.
[7211.22s -> 7212.26s]  I hung it up, right?
[7212.26s -> 7212.82s]  I did.
[7212.82s -> 7213.06s]  Good.
[7213.62s -> 7214.18s]  Smart boy.
[7214.90s -> 7218.09s]  I'm gonna go for a flip.
[7218.09s -> 7218.65s]  Don't!
[7218.65s -> 7220.41s]  Every time I fuck this up.
[7220.41s -> 7221.29s]  I'm not gonna fuck it up.
[7221.29s -> 7222.41s]  I do it every single time.
[7223.29s -> 7224.17s]  Not this time though.
[7224.97s -> 7227.56s]  This is the time where I actually get it back in the pan.
[7233.46s -> 7233.86s]  Got it.
[7238.70s -> 7239.18s]  He got it.
[7239.74s -> 7242.76s]  Do it again.
[7249.58s -> 7249.82s]  All right.
[7249.82s -> 7250.30s]  Need a plate.
[7250.86s -> 7252.34s]  Here we go.
[7255.70s -> 7256.26s]  Serve hot.
[7256.26s -> 7256.58s]  That's it.
[7256.58s -> 7257.62s]  Just get a plate.
[7257.62s -> 7258.50s]  Do I have one?
[7258.50s -> 7259.46s]  Is a broken one over there.
[7262.22s -> 7262.86s]  Basic plate.
[7265.53s -> 7265.77s]  Okay.
[7265.77s -> 7266.49s]  I'm almost ready.
[7267.05s -> 7273.67s]  Potatoes come out.
[7273.67s -> 7274.63s]  This is gonna be 100.
[7274.63s -> 7275.67s]  It's gonna be like 120 seconds.
[7275.67s -> 7275.91s]  All right.
[7275.91s -> 7276.15s]  Here we go.
[7276.15s -> 7276.47s]  Here we go.
[7276.47s -> 7276.87s]  Almost done.
[7277.59s -> 7280.22s]  This is gonna be perfect.
[7280.22s -> 7293.78s]  It's gonna be right on time.
[7298.39s -> 7298.71s]  Okay.
[7299.66s -> 7299.90s]  One.
[7300.78s -> 7301.02s]  Two.
[7301.82s -> 7302.06s]  Three.
[7303.10s -> 7303.58s]  Take it out.
[7304.30s -> 7304.94s]  Don't drop it.
[7312.17s -> 7312.65s]  Oh no.
[7313.59s -> 7314.15s]  Is it over the...
[7319.40s -> 7320.12s]  Come on.
[7320.12s -> 7321.16s]  How do you do this?
[7322.44s -> 7322.68s]  All right.
[7322.68s -> 7323.72s]  Give her the plate.
[7323.72s -> 7324.60s]  Stop ringing.
[7324.60s -> 7325.72s]  I wish it didn't ring this much.
[7339.67s -> 7340.31s]  Done.
[7340.31s -> 7345.58s]  What did I do wrong?
[7348.55s -> 7350.31s]  Potatoes with too much salt.
[7350.31s -> 7353.06s]  Why does the recipe say 20 grams if it's too much?
[7353.70s -> 7359.96s]  Okay.
[7359.96s -> 7360.36s]  I'm done.
[7363.10s -> 7363.34s]  So.
[7363.90s -> 7367.24s]  Did I do at least four stars?
[7367.24s -> 7377.64s]  Okay.
[7377.64s -> 7378.68s]  Let's clean up.
[7378.68s -> 7379.40s]  I got...
[7379.40s -> 7379.72s]  Okay.
[7379.72s -> 7380.52s]  This is perfect.
[7380.52s -> 7381.24s]  This is amazing.
[7381.24s -> 7382.20s]  I got plenty of time.
[7382.20s -> 7383.16s]  I gotta clean this stove.
[7383.80s -> 7384.60s]  Clean this shit up.
[7386.46s -> 7387.02s]  Into the sink.
[7388.87s -> 7389.19s]  No.
[7389.19s -> 7397.83s]  Dump it in the sink.
[7397.83s -> 7398.55s]  All right.
[7398.55s -> 7399.75s]  I'm not gonna do that anymore.
[7402.30s -> 7403.18s]  Just get it in the sink.
[7407.86s -> 7408.50s]  There we go.
[7408.50s -> 7408.90s]  Finally.
[7411.54s -> 7414.10s]  I just poured it into the oven.
[7414.10s -> 7415.22s]  Come on.
[7415.22s -> 7417.06s]  Get out of the fucking way.
[7417.06s -> 7417.38s]  Why?
[7418.42s -> 7422.73s]  Why is it playing like the Godfather music?
[7422.73s -> 7424.17s]  Is somebody gonna come here and whack me?
[7424.89s -> 7437.19s]  Can I not clean this?
[7437.75s -> 7444.62s]  I don't think I can clean in here.
[7445.18s -> 7447.91s]  All right.
[7447.91s -> 7448.95s]  Pots are ready.
[7448.95s -> 7449.91s]  Hang the spatula up.
[7453.88s -> 7454.60s]  Sour cream.
[7455.32s -> 7456.60s]  There's not very much left in there.
[7456.60s -> 7457.40s]  There is a little bit.
[7458.04s -> 7460.14s]  Okay.
[7460.14s -> 7462.06s]  Let's get the spices back to normal.
[7462.78s -> 7465.26s]  Turn off the heat.
[7465.26s -> 7465.90s]  That would be nice.
[7466.86s -> 7467.26s]  Blend.
[7467.90s -> 7468.50s]  All right.
[7468.50s -> 7469.06s]  That's fine.
[7469.54s -> 7471.06s]  Look at how fucking dirty it is in here.
[7471.78s -> 7472.58s]  All right.
[7472.58s -> 7472.98s]  Give me the...
[7480.94s -> 7481.74s]  What?
[7481.74s -> 7482.54s]  I can't clean that?
[7483.10s -> 7487.86s]  Do I need to buy a new stove?
[7493.80s -> 7494.68s]  How much time do I got?
[7494.68s -> 7495.32s]  A couple minutes.
[7496.12s -> 7497.80s]  Let's get the cutting board in a good spot.
[7498.44s -> 7500.70s]  Get the knife on over here.
[7502.58s -> 7503.46s]  Salt and pepper.
[7504.18s -> 7504.90s]  Put them together.
[7505.62s -> 7508.71s]  The other spices can just hang out over here.
[7510.18s -> 7511.78s]  Everything that needs salt always needs pepper,
[7511.78s -> 7513.14s]  so I'm just gonna keep them right next to each other.
[7513.70s -> 7517.56s]  The rest of these can just hang out over here.
[7518.20s -> 7518.68s]  All right.
[7518.68s -> 7519.72s]  I'm gonna get a new recipe.
[7522.47s -> 7524.47s]  I'm gonna use it eventually, so just keep it over here.
[7526.86s -> 7528.62s]  Here's the reverse jazz...
[7528.62s -> 7529.10s]  Don't break.
[7530.71s -> 7531.83s]  The reverse jazz song.
[7534.18s -> 7535.46s]  I can clean that.
[7535.46s -> 7536.74s]  I can't clean this.
[7536.74s -> 7537.86s]  None of this is even dirty.
[7538.66s -> 7541.00s]  Okay.
[7541.00s -> 7541.32s]  I'm good.
[7547.40s -> 7548.36s]  Anything else that I need to do?
[7549.16s -> 7549.88s]  Besides mop?
[7552.87s -> 7553.59s]  I'll write this.
[7558.54s -> 7558.70s]  Yeah.
[7558.70s -> 7559.90s]  The broken plate on the ground.
[7565.40s -> 7566.68s]  There's no broom or something.
[7566.68s -> 7567.88s]  I can definitely sweep, right?
[7569.05s -> 7570.09s]  You have to be able to sweep.
[7577.18s -> 7577.58s]  Yeah.
[7577.58s -> 7579.18s]  I'll get a stove cleaning company.
[7588.30s -> 7588.46s]  Here.
[7588.46s -> 7589.26s]  I got a better idea.
[7601.21s -> 7602.41s]  No, I'm not gonna throw it in the...
[7602.41s -> 7605.05s]  I'm just doing this so I don't have to run around.
[7605.05s -> 7608.95s]  Don't waste.
[7609.59s -> 7611.62s]  What do you...
[7611.62s -> 7612.50s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[7613.06s -> 7616.90s]  You want me to use already old cooked ingredients for tomorrow?
[7628.12s -> 7629.24s]  Is that gonna work?
[7629.24s -> 7634.41s]  That's how stock is made.
[7635.67s -> 7635.99s]  Yeah.
[7637.35s -> 7640.23s]  I don't think that people are gonna want to eat like an old cooked tomato.
[7640.95s -> 7642.89s]  All right.
[7642.89s -> 7644.17s]  Heat proof gloves.
[7644.17s -> 7644.89s]  Long reach.
[7647.06s -> 7647.78s]  Thermal division.
[7648.42s -> 7653.46s]  Connections.
[7654.10s -> 7655.54s]  Time slows when cutting ingredients.
[7656.26s -> 7660.49s]  I think I'm gonna do long arms or heat proof gloves.
[7662.98s -> 7663.54s]  Yeah.
[7663.54s -> 7663.78s]  All right.
[7663.78s -> 7665.06s]  So I can just pick shit up and move it around.
[7665.70s -> 7668.04s]  Or long hands.
[7677.86s -> 7679.38s]  Let's do long arms.
[7679.38s -> 7681.32s]  So I gave them a lot of money.
[7681.32s -> 7682.04s]  This is not as important.
[7682.04s -> 7682.92s]  Hold on.
[7682.92s -> 7684.98s]  Is there one I can increase the time?
[7685.62s -> 7687.45s]  Experience points.
[7688.25s -> 7688.89s]  More fame.
[7690.09s -> 7691.21s]  Products cost less.
[7692.01s -> 7693.45s]  I mean, this is important.
[7697.45s -> 7699.29s]  Liquids stuff costs less.
[7700.01s -> 7701.56s]  I'm doing it twice.
[7702.20s -> 7716.57s]  Demonstrate your skills.
[7716.57s -> 7716.89s]  All right.
[7716.89s -> 7718.57s]  I cleaned up a little bit so I should be good to go.
[7719.21s -> 7719.85s]  Repair company.
[7721.40s -> 7721.80s]  Quickly.
[7723.96s -> 7724.44s]  Hurry up.
[7728.18s -> 7728.82s]  13 seconds.
[7728.82s -> 7729.14s]  Quickly.
[7729.14s -> 7730.26s]  Come on, come on, come on.
[7730.26s -> 7731.61s]  How long is it gonna take?
[7732.41s -> 7733.05s]  15 seconds?
[7733.78s -> 7734.58s]  This is expensive.
[7735.30s -> 7735.54s]  Okay.
[7735.54s -> 7735.94s]  Fine.
[7735.94s -> 7736.34s]  We're good.
[7742.14s -> 7742.38s]  All right.
[7742.38s -> 7744.38s]  I got two minutes until I'm ready to go.
[7744.38s -> 7745.82s]  I'm getting my ingredients out.
[7747.30s -> 7751.48s]  I'm getting a couple of chicken broths.
[7751.48s -> 7753.00s]  Can I buy a recipe?
[7758.55s -> 7759.03s]  Not owned.
[7759.03s -> 7759.27s]  Okay.
[7760.15s -> 7761.59s]  Pork chops with baked potatoes.
[7762.23s -> 7763.69s]  I can do that.
[7774.12s -> 7775.16s]  Do more soups?
[7775.16s -> 7776.84s]  I don't have, I don't think I can do soups.
[7779.53s -> 7780.17s]  Duck broth.
[7781.62s -> 7783.14s]  I'm not famous enough for duck broth.
[7783.78s -> 7787.61s]  I can do pork chop and baked potatoes.
[7792.71s -> 7793.11s]  Yeah.
[7793.11s -> 7793.67s]  Pork chops.
[7796.46s -> 7797.58s]  I can't buy soups.
[7801.98s -> 7802.54s]  Perks.
[7802.54s -> 7803.42s]  Skills.
[7803.42s -> 7804.22s]  Everything's good to go.
[7805.62s -> 7806.34s]  All right.
[7806.34s -> 7807.94s]  So I'm gonna pre-make the soup.
[7808.89s -> 7810.01s]  I need to pre-make soup.
[7810.01s -> 7810.89s]  So let's get it out.
[7810.89s -> 7811.85s]  Let's get the ingredients out.
[7812.41s -> 7814.79s]  Just pre-make everything and then put it in the microwave.
[7815.51s -> 7815.75s]  All right.
[7815.75s -> 7816.15s]  Here's the soup.
[7816.15s -> 7816.79s]  I already got it right here.
[7816.79s -> 7820.01s]  What do I need?
[7820.01s -> 7821.21s]  No, this is all...
[7821.21s -> 7822.25s]  I need one more beet, right?
[7826.71s -> 7827.35s]  One more beet?
[7829.24s -> 7830.52s]  No, that's not gonna work.
[7830.52s -> 7834.47s]  Is this gonna work?
[7839.26s -> 7840.46s]  And then an onion, right?
[7842.17s -> 7843.21s]  This is not gonna work, guys.
[7845.61s -> 7846.81s]  No, I'm throwing this shit away.
[7846.81s -> 7852.02s]  Which one is the one that I just bought?
[7852.02s -> 7853.54s]  I'm not gonna serve customers old food.
[7854.10s -> 7858.12s]  That's not how it works.
[7858.12s -> 7861.83s]  This is the new one.
[7861.83s -> 7863.43s]  Gordon Ramsay would come in this restaurant
[7863.43s -> 7864.95s]  and start fucking trashing the place.
[7871.24s -> 7873.90s]  Five and then I need an onion.
[7873.90s -> 7874.86s]  No, what is it?
[7874.86s -> 7882.30s]  Carrot and then parsley, right?
[7882.30s -> 7886.30s]  Parsley and then what is it?
[7886.30s -> 7887.26s]  One onion, right?
[7891.29s -> 7892.97s]  And then it's chicken broth or is it water?
[7895.50s -> 7897.26s]  Let's get like two or three chicken broths out here.
[7907.22s -> 7908.02s]  And sour cream.
[7908.58s -> 7911.43s]  Well, not yet, not yet.
[7911.43s -> 7912.31s]  Don't overbuy everything.
[7912.31s -> 7913.35s]  All right, I got my spices.
[7913.91s -> 7915.21s]  I got my pre-made soup.
[7915.21s -> 7915.85s]  Wait, what's the other one?
[7915.85s -> 7916.73s]  The other one's tomato, right?
[7916.73s -> 7918.41s]  Let's get over here.
[7918.41s -> 7919.29s]  How many tomatoes is it?
[7921.66s -> 7923.58s]  It's one, two, eight tomatoes.
[7927.53s -> 7930.25s]  Eight and then it's one onion, right?
[7932.63s -> 7934.31s]  Eight and then an onion, I think.
[7935.03s -> 7938.26s]  Okay, that's good to go.
[7938.98s -> 7941.83s]  Now that's also chicken broth, right?
[7941.83s -> 7947.32s]  Here we go.
[7947.32s -> 7948.20s]  This is why you prep.
[7950.95s -> 7952.28s]  New order.
[7952.28s -> 7953.08s]  Fish.
[7953.08s -> 7958.07s]  I know this one by heart almost.
[7958.15s -> 7960.50s]  Where's my tray?
[7960.50s -> 7961.99s]  Where's my tray?
[7961.99s -> 7966.02s]  Where's the fucking tray?
[7966.82s -> 7967.46s]  Come on, man.
[7968.10s -> 7968.42s]  Really?
[7971.35s -> 7974.81s]  I prepped and everything and the tray's just not here anymore.
[7974.81s -> 7976.25s]  I don't own a tray anymore.
[7976.25s -> 7978.38s]  Are you kidding me?
[7978.38s -> 7987.75s]  I'm wasting fucking time already.
[7987.75s -> 7989.75s]  Okay, it's pepper time, dill.
[7996.07s -> 7997.19s]  Three, four, five.
[8006.57s -> 8009.24s]  Get it.
[8009.24s -> 8010.68s]  Pepper is right next to it, right here.
[8012.71s -> 8014.55s]  And then bake 90 seconds.
[8014.55s -> 8022.60s]  Get it in there.
[8022.60s -> 8024.20s]  90 seconds and then hoist.
[8024.20s -> 8024.60s]  Yep.
[8024.60s -> 8035.21s]  Don't run like you usually do.
[8035.21s -> 8036.65s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[8036.97s -> 8038.01s]  Get it in the oven.
[8039.14s -> 8049.06s]  91, two, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[8049.06s -> 8051.51s]  I just did way too much time.
[8056.04s -> 8059.11s]  Okay, now we got the lemon quarter.
[8059.11s -> 8064.66s]  Just get it ready.
[8064.66s -> 8070.17s]  Freeze time.
[8070.17s -> 8070.65s]  Excellent.
[8071.21s -> 8073.14s]  Right down the middle.
[8073.14s -> 8074.18s]  Right down the center.
[8074.18s -> 8074.82s]  Perfect.
[8074.82s -> 8075.70s]  Not perfect, but it's okay.
[8075.70s -> 8076.26s]  Could be worse.
[8076.90s -> 8077.62s]  Plate.
[8077.62s -> 8078.90s]  Do I already have a plate?
[8078.90s -> 8079.94s]  No, I do not, Jeremy.
[8079.94s -> 8080.98s]  Focus, god damn it.
[8082.23s -> 8083.19s]  You're gonna lose everything.
[8083.19s -> 8084.23s]  You're gonna lose everything.
[8088.09s -> 8092.14s]  When that shit comes out, we got horseradish five.
[8092.14s -> 8093.42s]  Get it on the plate.
[8093.42s -> 8093.90s]  Parsley.
[8094.38s -> 8103.10s]  Come on.
[8103.66s -> 8130.42s]  You done?
[8130.98s -> 8133.56s]  Oh, come on.
[8133.56s -> 8135.00s]  Hurry up and be done.
[8135.00s -> 8141.24s]  You're killing me.
[8141.24s -> 8142.76s]  One, two, three.
[8142.76s -> 8155.08s]  Horseradish.
[8155.08s -> 8157.08s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[8163.64s -> 8164.04s]  Easy.
[8164.60s -> 8165.24s]  Parsley.
[8165.24s -> 8169.91s]  Six.
[8169.91s -> 8170.79s]  Six.
[8170.79s -> 8173.02s]  Okay, done.
[8173.02s -> 8173.34s]  Enjoy.
[8173.34s -> 8175.58s]  Bon appetit.
[8175.58s -> 8176.22s]  Dick.
[8176.22s -> 8185.14s]  Don't be that mad.
[8185.14s -> 8186.98s]  And here you go, you dick.
[8187.70s -> 8191.75s]  All right, I'm prepped.
[8191.75s -> 8192.71s]  New order.
[8192.71s -> 8196.60s]  The Bostromish, whatever this is called.
[8196.60s -> 8197.90s]  All right, everything's ready.
[8197.90s -> 8198.94s]  Chicken broth.
[8198.94s -> 8199.42s]  Salt.
[8199.42s -> 8200.30s]  Chicken broth, salt.
[8200.30s -> 8200.70s]  Pepper.
[8201.94s -> 8202.66s]  Everything's already in there.
[8202.66s -> 8222.09s]  Chicken broth, salt, pepper.
[8222.09s -> 8226.79s]  Fucking close enough.
[8226.79s -> 8228.38s]  Salt and pepper.
[8228.38s -> 8239.22s]  20 of each.
[8239.22s -> 8241.91s]  20.
[8241.91s -> 8243.03s]  Did that actually get in there?
[8248.15s -> 8248.71s]  Am I crazy?
[8248.71s -> 8249.91s]  Did that say 10?
[8249.91s -> 8256.38s]  Did that not all go in?
[8272.02s -> 8272.98s]  Did it not all go in?
[8272.98s -> 8273.86s]  That was fucking weird.
[8274.84s -> 8275.88s]  It said 12.
[8275.88s -> 8277.08s]  All right, where's my pepper?
[8277.72s -> 8280.17s]  This is why I fucking prepped.
[8280.17s -> 8281.61s]  Give me my pepper, god damn it.
[8282.33s -> 8282.81s]  20.
[8282.81s -> 8283.45s]  Okay.
[8283.45s -> 8295.53s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
[8295.53s -> 8297.21s]  I'm understanding what's happening here.
[8297.21s -> 8298.65s]  I have salted.
[8299.21s -> 8301.85s]  I put like 20 grams of salt on one beat.
[8303.24s -> 8305.00s]  Oh my fucking god, whatever.
[8305.00s -> 8306.04s]  Okay, boil the time.
[8306.04s -> 8306.92s]  Just boil, go.
[8306.92s -> 8314.60s]  I don't have time for this.
[8314.60s -> 8315.40s]  120 seconds.
[8316.04s -> 8317.75s]  Put it on.
[8317.75s -> 8320.26s]  On 10.
[8320.98s -> 8322.60s]  All right, here we go.
[8323.08s -> 8324.20s]  Now we just fucking hang out.
[8324.20s -> 8324.68s]  Who cares?
[8327.86s -> 8329.70s]  I didn't mix it into the broth somehow.
[8329.70s -> 8331.14s]  You don't stir this up.
[8331.14s -> 8333.54s]  I want to pick it up by the sides and just like shake it around.
[8338.34s -> 8340.92s]  I'm gonna blow this place up.
[8341.56s -> 8352.02s]  Put propane in the oven.
[8352.02s -> 8353.14s]  I'm not doing that yet.
[8355.54s -> 8370.42s]  Give me another order so I can start prepping.
[8370.42s -> 8371.86s]  Add 40 seconds to the timer.
[8371.86s -> 8373.30s]  I want to just like start breaking stuff.
[8373.30s -> 8373.46s]  No.
[8374.26s -> 8378.25s]  The onions are overcooked.
[8379.80s -> 8380.68s]  Not yet.
[8380.68s -> 8383.48s]  They will be very soon.
[8383.48s -> 8396.76s]  Almost done?
[8396.76s -> 8400.58s]  Almost done, almost done, almost done, almost done, almost done, almost done,
[8400.90s -> 8406.15s]  one, two, three, four, five.
[8406.15s -> 8407.67s]  Why are the onions so overcooked?
[8407.67s -> 8411.75s]  You put everything in the pot and you boil it at the same time.
[8411.75s -> 8412.31s]  I don't understand.
[8413.38s -> 8414.42s]  Take the onion out.
[8416.50s -> 8419.69s]  All right, off, out, into a bowl.
[8422.10s -> 8423.46s]  And then sayonara.
[8423.46s -> 8433.70s]  Just pick up the onion with your hand.
[8433.70s -> 8451.00s]  Am I ever gonna buy a ladle for this shit?
[8451.00s -> 8451.48s]  Order up.
[8452.28s -> 8456.10s]  Italian borscht.
[8456.10s -> 8456.58s]  Pretty good.
[8460.84s -> 8461.56s]  Not enough pepper.
[8461.56s -> 8463.32s]  Yeah, I understand what's happening now.
[8464.20s -> 8465.85s]  All right, here comes the food critic.
[8465.85s -> 8466.97s]  Save the fucking game.
[8466.97s -> 8475.77s]  Here we go.
[8475.77s -> 8477.78s]  Oh no, I've never made this before.
[8477.78s -> 8478.58s]  I don't know how to do this.
[8479.38s -> 8480.50s]  Of course he orders the new thing.
[8480.50s -> 8482.10s]  I don't know how to make pork chops.
[8483.42s -> 8484.14s]  Okay, pork chops.
[8484.78s -> 8485.59s]  How many do I need?
[8485.59s -> 8485.83s]  Two?
[8487.50s -> 8490.74s]  Just one.
[8490.74s -> 8495.62s]  All right, and then salt the pork chop with black pepper and salt.
[8495.62s -> 8496.18s]  And then thyme.
[8496.82s -> 8499.13s]  So thyme, six grams.
[8501.18s -> 8505.72s]  One, six.
[8505.72s -> 8508.82s]  And then salt and pepper, four.
[8514.33s -> 8515.29s]  Evenly season it.
[8519.54s -> 8520.42s]  Four, nice.
[8529.59s -> 8531.43s]  For Minecraft food.
[8532.55s -> 8534.47s]  Somebody says, okay, pan.
[8535.19s -> 8536.47s]  Don't forget about the food critic.
[8536.47s -> 8537.51s]  What do you mean time's running out?
[8537.51s -> 8538.95s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[8538.95s -> 8540.31s]  Sunflower oil, pork chops.
[8540.31s -> 8542.71s]  Okay, 30 milliliters of sunflower oil.
[8542.71s -> 8543.67s]  Sunflower oil.
[8546.10s -> 8547.54s]  30 milliliters of sunflower oil.
[8552.73s -> 8553.61s]  What do you mean mixture?
[8555.06s -> 8556.02s]  Is the oil already in here?
[8558.02s -> 8562.60s]  There's like dirty fish oil in here.
[8564.76s -> 8565.96s]  Hope you're not allergic.
[8566.68s -> 8569.32s]  All right, so we got fry for 90 seconds each side.
[8570.30s -> 8572.54s]  Okay, fry for, what else do we need to do?
[8572.54s -> 8574.28s]  And then bake potatoes.
[8575.61s -> 8576.89s]  And then you bake.
[8576.89s -> 8578.41s]  Okay, cut potato into chunks.
[8579.13s -> 8583.42s]  Cut potato, 300 grams of potatoes into chunks.
[8590.36s -> 8592.36s]  Okay, I need to say, pause it.
[8593.00s -> 8596.28s]  I just took my hand, picked it up with my fucking hand.
[8597.37s -> 8600.57s]  And forcibly tried to stick it to the table.
[8600.57s -> 8605.62s]  Like, like I was making a, oh.
[8608.55s -> 8609.35s]  Oh my God.
[8609.35s -> 8610.31s]  All right, I need to focus.
[8611.19s -> 8612.47s]  300 grams of potatoes.
[8612.47s -> 8613.43s]  How many potatoes is that?
[8615.03s -> 8618.06s]  I do need a plate eventually here.
[8618.06s -> 8619.74s]  So 300 grams of potatoes.
[8620.46s -> 8621.93s]  It's two potatoes.
[8622.65s -> 8626.94s]  Transfer them over to here.
[8627.74s -> 8632.74s]  So I got to cut these into chunks of 50 grams.
[8635.40s -> 8638.52s]  So I need six chunks.
[8643.06s -> 8644.18s]  So cut them into threes.
[8644.98s -> 8675.14s]  Oh, chunks of 50.
[8675.14s -> 8676.58s]  And that's, that's, yeah, that's six.
[8677.62s -> 8678.94s]  I didn't do anything wrong.
[8680.68s -> 8682.68s]  Baking tray, bake for 80 seconds.
[8682.68s -> 8683.96s]  Where's the baking tray?
[8683.96s -> 8684.52s]  Already in there.
[8685.08s -> 8693.34s]  Okay, turn the oven on.
[8697.22s -> 8697.86s]  80 seconds.
[8697.86s -> 8698.26s]  Here we go.
[8698.26s -> 8700.26s]  Now let's just fry, fry, fry, fry, fry, fry, fry.
[8705.70s -> 8707.46s]  I put tomato soup in there.
[8707.46s -> 8723.83s]  All right, fry for 90 seconds a side.
[8723.83s -> 8724.87s]  Okay, good.
[8724.87s -> 8730.73s]  I think.
[8730.73s -> 8731.85s]  Okay, now anything else?
[8731.85s -> 8732.25s]  Anything else?
[8734.33s -> 8735.77s]  Just transfer them onto the plate.
[8735.77s -> 8736.33s]  Hot.
[8736.33s -> 8744.89s]  Where's my spatula?
[8744.89s -> 8750.86s]  I'm ready for this shit.
[8752.06s -> 8753.90s]  I'm a flipping master at this point.
[8763.67s -> 8764.07s]  Potatoes?
[8764.07s -> 8765.27s]  What do you mean potatoes?
[8765.27s -> 8769.19s]  These are fine.
[8769.19s -> 8769.99s]  They're fine, they're fine, they're fine.
[8769.99s -> 8771.19s]  Don't fucking freak me out like that.
[8771.19s -> 8772.07s]  Like another five seconds.
[8772.63s -> 8783.91s]  This was on a perfect timer.
[8783.91s -> 8789.35s]  They're done.
[8789.35s -> 8793.26s]  No, put this down.
[8794.50s -> 8795.38s]  Put it down.
[8795.38s -> 8796.42s]  Put the tray down.
[8799.82s -> 8801.58s]  Oh, where's my, where's my flipper?
[8809.42s -> 8810.30s]  What the?
[8810.30s -> 8822.97s]  Got it.
[8822.97s -> 8823.47s]  What?
[8838.47s -> 8839.99s]  I didn't do anything.
[8839.99s -> 8841.51s]  I didn't do anything.
[8842.23s -> 8843.11s]  It's not fair.
[8845.34s -> 8851.38s]  90 seconds.
[8851.38s -> 8853.14s]  50, 60, 70, 80.
[8853.14s -> 8854.18s]  I don't know.
[8855.38s -> 8859.32s]  Oh, I'm, I'm cooking on there.
[8859.32s -> 8860.44s]  I can't fucking believe it.
[8860.44s -> 8861.32s]  Why did that happen?
[8862.04s -> 8873.02s]  Motherfucker.
[8873.02s -> 8874.30s]  Just went through the bottom of the pan.
[8875.77s -> 8876.49s]  Unbelievable.
[8894.06s -> 8894.86s]  At least these are done.
[8895.42s -> 8900.65s]  Let me clean up while I go here.
[8909.13s -> 8910.65s]  It exploded on me.
[8910.65s -> 8911.69s]  That's bullshit.
[8917.30s -> 8919.62s]  Get it on a plate and hopefully I get four stars.
[8919.62s -> 8920.98s]  Hopefully it doesn't taste the glass.
[8921.62s -> 8923.80s]  I'm gonna be crunching on it.
[8923.80s -> 8926.04s]  Oh, this is good.
[8926.04s -> 8927.40s]  I taste a heavy iron.
[8928.28s -> 8931.30s]  That's a really strong iron taste.
[8932.10s -> 8932.82s]  It stings too.
[8932.82s -> 8933.46s]  Is this spices on?
[8933.46s -> 8934.90s]  Is this hot sauce on here?
[8934.98s -> 8936.66s]  My mouth is, my mouth hurts.
[8940.82s -> 8941.54s]  All right, let's go.
[8973.11s -> 8974.55s]  I see this, I don't like,
[8974.55s -> 8976.07s]  why can't I just like put it down?
[8976.63s -> 8977.59s]  I need to get the gloves.
[8978.23s -> 8987.50s]  Oh my fucking god.
[8988.06s -> 8989.58s]  I just can't put it down.
[8995.06s -> 8996.90s]  Why can't I just place it?
[9002.63s -> 9003.75s]  Oh my god.
[9003.75s -> 9016.06s]  I just, good enough.
[9016.06s -> 9026.89s]  Hope you like it.
[9029.45s -> 9033.54s]  Come on.
[9033.54s -> 9034.58s]  Not enough.
[9034.58s -> 9035.70s]  I lost a bunch of fame.
[9035.70s -> 9041.00s]  Well blame the salmon filet.
[9041.00s -> 9065.62s]  I'm gonna scum this.
[9066.34s -> 9068.78s]  Here we go.
[9068.78s -> 9080.95s]  How do you clean it?
[9081.35s -> 9084.31s]  Is it clean?
[9092.01s -> 9092.49s]  It's clean.
[9095.70s -> 9096.50s]  Nothing in here, right?
[9098.39s -> 9098.79s]  Here we go.
[9098.79s -> 9099.27s]  Now I'll get this,
[9099.27s -> 9100.07s]  I'll get the pan.
[9100.07s -> 9100.55s]  It's empty.
[9102.47s -> 9104.31s]  Okay, what do I do now?
[9104.31s -> 9105.27s]  What do I do?
[9105.27s -> 9106.23s]  Okay, pork chops.
[9115.74s -> 9116.94s]  Salt, black pepper, thyme.
[9116.94s -> 9117.26s]  Yep.
[9123.38s -> 9125.22s]  Two, three, four.
[9125.78s -> 9127.56s]  It's the thyme.
[9130.07s -> 9131.59s]  Wait, it was six thyme.
[9137.43s -> 9138.15s]  Six, okay.
[9138.15s -> 9140.28s]  Then we need pepper salt.
[9144.10s -> 9144.74s]  Oh fuck.
[9145.54s -> 9146.34s]  Turn it off, turn it off.
[9151.69s -> 9154.25s]  One, two, three, four.
[9154.25s -> 9154.65s]  Got it.
[9159.38s -> 9160.18s]  All right.
[9160.18s -> 9163.80s]  Three, four.
[9163.80s -> 9165.72s]  All right, got like the dinosaur dropping zone there.
[9166.60s -> 9167.16s]  That's it.
[9167.16s -> 9169.56s]  Now we add oil to the pan and pork chop.
[9169.56s -> 9170.92s]  Let's get the potatoes ready as well.
[9170.92s -> 9171.96s]  I got plenty of time.
[9171.96s -> 9174.86s]  It's two potatoes.
[9177.40s -> 9177.72s]  Stop.
[9177.72s -> 9179.32s]  Okay, I'm like panicking for no reason.
[9180.52s -> 9181.64s]  Plate, potatoes.
[9182.28s -> 9182.84s]  It's two.
[9188.52s -> 9191.00s]  Two, sunflower oil, pork chop.
[9191.00s -> 9193.80s]  Potato into chunks of 50 grams.
[9193.80s -> 9194.84s]  And then I didn't salt them.
[9195.86s -> 9208.18s]  Okay, they're all getting cooked anyways.
[9208.18s -> 9208.82s]  Don't relax.
[9210.41s -> 9215.30s]  Chunks of three.
[9220.42s -> 9221.06s]  Don't do it like that.
[9221.06s -> 9221.86s]  Don't be a fucking idiot.
[9236.90s -> 9237.46s]  Oh shit.
[9247.30s -> 9248.34s]  How many did I cut?
[9249.74s -> 9251.10s]  How many did I cut?
[9253.29s -> 9253.69s]  It's okay.
[9253.69s -> 9255.29s]  I can cook them and it doesn't matter.
[9255.29s -> 9257.96s]  Salt them.
[9257.96s -> 9264.68s]  Six grams of salt.
[9264.68s -> 9271.30s]  One, two, four, five, six.
[9272.10s -> 9272.90s]  Come on, six.
[9273.54s -> 9274.50s]  Get them on the tray.
[9289.69s -> 9292.81s]  Is there a reason why this doesn't work half the time?
[9293.53s -> 9294.57s]  Get in the fucking oven.
[9299.85s -> 9300.73s]  What are you doing?
[9302.62s -> 9303.18s]  Go.
[9303.18s -> 9305.77s]  Heat the oil.
[9305.77s -> 9306.94s]  30 milliliters.
[9318.10s -> 9319.18s]  Heat.
[9319.18s -> 9320.06s]  Heat the oil.
[9320.06s -> 9320.94s]  Here we go.
[9320.94s -> 9322.70s]  I'm ready.
[9322.70s -> 9323.74s]  Not fucking this up again.
[9323.74s -> 9324.22s]  Here we go.
[9324.22s -> 9325.74s]  One, two, three.
[9325.74s -> 9339.21s]  Wait till the oil is heated.
[9339.21s -> 9356.94s]  90 seconds.
[9356.94s -> 9358.06s]  All right, whew.
[9358.06s -> 9362.90s]  We're good.
[9362.90s -> 9373.66s]  We're almost done.
[9373.66s -> 9381.11s]  I don't know what to do with my hands right now.
[9381.11s -> 9385.40s]  All right, I gotta get ready.
[9385.40s -> 9388.20s]  I need a place to put this shit.
[9389.48s -> 9390.68s]  Move this out of the way.
[9390.68s -> 9397.64s]  Okay, perfect.
[9397.64s -> 9398.20s]  Clean that up.
[9398.76s -> 9399.96s]  Put the tray here onto this.
[9400.52s -> 9401.24s]  Yep.
[9401.24s -> 9401.80s]  Okay, timer.
[9401.80s -> 9402.60s]  Looking good.
[9402.60s -> 9403.08s]  Spatula.
[9403.08s -> 9403.88s]  Where is it?
[9403.88s -> 9404.76s]  The oil is burning.
[9405.66s -> 9406.14s]  Oh fuck.
[9407.02s -> 9408.30s]  I thought I had to wait till oil to heat up.
[9408.30s -> 9409.34s]  The oil is like on fire.
[9413.35s -> 9414.31s]  Fuck the potatoes.
[9418.71s -> 9419.43s]  No.
[9419.43s -> 9423.51s]  I only need a few.
[9423.51s -> 9424.55s]  I only need six.
[9425.19s -> 9427.14s]  I only need six.
[9427.86s -> 9428.74s]  Okay, what about this?
[9428.74s -> 9429.46s]  This is almost done, right?
[9431.35s -> 9431.67s]  Flip.
[9431.67s -> 9432.47s]  Where's my splipper?
[9433.43s -> 9434.87s]  Okay, slow down.
[9434.87s -> 9435.43s]  Slow down.
[9435.43s -> 9436.07s]  Slow down.
[9443.14s -> 9443.78s]  Oh yeah.
[9443.78s -> 9444.18s]  Okay, good.
[9444.82s -> 9445.93s]  Shut up.
[9446.57s -> 9452.33s]  Good.
[9452.33s -> 9452.81s]  All right.
[9452.81s -> 9453.37s]  Potatoes.
[9453.37s -> 9454.01s]  I need six.
[9454.57s -> 9457.61s]  Which ones didn't fall on the ground?
[9457.61s -> 9461.05s]  One, two, three, four.
[9462.01s -> 9462.97s]  Five, six.
[9463.94s -> 9464.18s]  Good.
[9465.46s -> 9466.90s]  Then put the pork chop on top and we're done.
[9470.60s -> 9471.56s]  90 seconds aside.
[9472.12s -> 9484.82s]  Where's my spatula?
[9484.82s -> 9491.43s]  Come on.
[9491.43s -> 9492.55s]  It's going to go to the red in a minute.
[9498.38s -> 9499.50s]  No, catch it before it falls.
[9499.50s -> 9499.90s]  Catch it.
[9500.54s -> 9502.25s]  Thank god.
[9502.25s -> 9519.03s]  It's almost done.
[9519.03s -> 9521.74s]  That's getting evenly cooked, right?
[9521.74s -> 9522.22s]  It better be.
[9528.70s -> 9529.34s]  10 seconds.
[9529.34s -> 9535.45s]  Nine, eight, seven, six.
[9535.45s -> 9536.09s]  Done.
[9536.09s -> 9539.54s]  That is very haphazard.
[9540.70s -> 9542.22s]  You don't get points for presentation, right?
[9542.22s -> 9543.02s]  Like this doesn't matter.
[9543.74s -> 9544.52s]  Just eat it.
[9544.92s -> 9550.26s]  We got our fame points.
[9550.98s -> 9551.86s]  Critic is pleased.
[9554.79s -> 9556.39s]  There's too much salt in the potatoes.
[9556.39s -> 9558.07s]  Well, cry me a river.
[9559.83s -> 9565.19s]  Timeline has been saved.
[9565.19s -> 9565.75s]  Thank god.
[9566.31s -> 9566.87s]  All right.
[9566.87s -> 9572.87s]  Closing down for the night.
[9572.87s -> 9573.83s]  No more orders.
[9573.83s -> 9574.39s]  Let's clean up.
[9574.39s -> 9592.92s]  Um, can I just save this?
[9592.92s -> 9593.72s]  I have an idea.
[9593.72s -> 9594.12s]  Hold on.
[9594.12s -> 9597.94s]  Can I do this?
[9598.82s -> 9633.99s]  I can't like store this in the fridge.
[9633.99s -> 9634.47s]  Well, here.
[9634.47s -> 9638.63s]  Just, I fucking hate this.
[9638.63s -> 9639.59s]  I swear to god.
[9639.59s -> 9643.66s]  I can't like keep leftovers in the...
[9643.66s -> 9644.94s]  I just wasted money now.
[9644.94s -> 9647.26s]  I wanted to keep leftovers in the fridge.
[9647.26s -> 9651.26s]  Leftovers somewhere.
[9651.26s -> 9654.04s]  Now I have to clean all this shit up.
[9654.04s -> 9655.72s]  Yeah, this is my Academy Award.
[9655.72s -> 9668.52s]  Why is there a timer up here?
[9669.98s -> 9670.54s]  Uh, all right.
[9670.54s -> 9671.42s]  I need to do song.
[9672.06s -> 9676.86s]  Nothing on the counter needs to be cleaned, right?
[9676.86s -> 9677.74s]  In the mop.
[9677.74s -> 9687.70s]  Why can't I rotate the mop?
[9688.79s -> 9691.11s]  It says rotate, but you can't rotate.
[9697.06s -> 9698.34s]  This is how I usually clean the floor.
[9698.34s -> 9698.90s]  I go like this.
[9699.62s -> 9702.10s]  I just kind of run back and forth from side to side
[9702.10s -> 9703.38s]  and just hold it in a new angle.
[9704.02s -> 9707.54s]  Usually does a pretty good job.
[9707.54s -> 9714.76s]  I need to pick up the glass.
[9715.40s -> 9720.47s]  I wanted to prepare.
[9721.03s -> 9722.39s]  This is not prepping for tomorrow.
[9722.39s -> 9723.27s]  This is bullshit.
[9724.73s -> 9725.93s]  This is needing to pick up glass
[9725.93s -> 9728.57s]  because I'm trying to put a bowl of soup in the fucking oven.
[9729.13s -> 9733.05s]  I'm very upset about this.
[9743.34s -> 9745.98s]  All right.
[9745.98s -> 9746.38s]  We good?
[9747.10s -> 9747.82s]  I think we're good.
[9748.38s -> 9749.82s]  Let me just move this stuff out of the way.
[9750.38s -> 9753.98s]  Come here.
[9753.98s -> 9754.70s]  Clean the pans.
[9755.34s -> 9756.31s]  This is dirty.
[9759.67s -> 9761.11s]  Let's get hot water.
[9761.11s -> 9768.89s]  How do I just dump it?
[9769.45s -> 9778.09s]  All right, that should be clean, right?
[9781.72s -> 9782.52s]  Yep, clean pan.
[9783.34s -> 9784.22s]  Still have plenty of oil.
[9784.22s -> 9785.10s]  Get the oil up here.
[9787.14s -> 9789.38s]  This is like only one milliliter thrown away.
[9789.38s -> 9792.66s]  I got plenty of chicken broth.
[9792.66s -> 9793.86s]  I got plenty of sour cream.
[9793.86s -> 9794.66s]  That's just still out.
[9794.66s -> 9795.62s]  Can I put this in the fridge?
[9796.50s -> 9798.17s]  Is this rot?
[9799.64s -> 9800.52s]  I don't think it does, guys.
[9800.52s -> 9801.08s]  I think we're fine.
[9801.72s -> 9809.03s]  52 bucks.
[9814.95s -> 9816.31s]  Reached level four.
[9816.31s -> 9820.42s]  Okay.
[9820.42s -> 9821.86s]  Request reward.
[9823.50s -> 9824.54s]  Cheaper liquid, I think.
[9825.34s -> 9825.58s]  Yeah.
[9826.22s -> 9832.63s]  Cheaper liquid.
[9832.63s -> 9833.43s]  Cheaper spices.
[9833.43s -> 9833.99s]  Probably cheap.
[9833.99s -> 9835.19s]  No, cheaper liquid twice.
[9835.75s -> 9836.47s]  What better tips?
[9837.11s -> 9846.49s]  Dish taste tolerance.
[9849.34s -> 9850.22s]  Yeah, more tips.
[9850.95s -> 9852.23s]  And taste tolerance.
[9852.79s -> 9854.71s]  That sounds good to me.
[9855.27s -> 9855.91s]  Choose a recipe.
[9855.91s -> 9856.31s]  Here we go.
[9856.87s -> 9858.71s]  I already have this.
[9863.99s -> 9864.79s]  I already own it.
[9865.19s -> 9867.78s]  Pork chops with bacon.
[9867.78s -> 9868.42s]  I already did it.
[9868.42s -> 9869.06s]  I did it already.
[9869.78s -> 9880.47s]  130.
[9884.82s -> 9885.78s]  Expand menu.
[9893.90s -> 9898.14s]  Am I actually soft-locked right now?
[9898.14s -> 9905.67s]  No.
[9905.67s -> 9907.91s]  I have to reload before I bought this.
[9908.63s -> 9909.83s]  No, don't make me do that again.
[9910.39s -> 9917.75s]  That's like an hour and a half ago.
[9917.75s -> 9929.58s]  Oh, no.
[9938.09s -> 9938.41s]  What?
[9939.51s -> 9943.29s]  Open the console?
[9943.29s -> 9945.13s]  There is no developer console.
[9945.13s -> 9953.67s]  I physically can't even get out of here.
[9953.67s -> 9955.11s]  I have to alt F4 the game.
[9960.60s -> 9961.24s]  No.
[9961.24s -> 9961.96s]  Why?
[9961.96s -> 9962.84s]  Oh, come on.
[9962.84s -> 9976.63s]  This sucks.
[9976.63s -> 9978.15s]  There's really no way for me to get out of here,
[9978.15s -> 9982.90s]  is there?
[9982.90s -> 9983.54s]  No.
[9983.54s -> 9984.34s]  I'm stuck.
[9985.67s -> 9987.53s]  Well, I can just do sandbox.
[9987.53s -> 9987.93s]  Fuck.
[9987.93s -> 9988.89s]  I was having a lot of fun.
[9996.98s -> 9998.42s]  Yeah, I was going to go into sandbox.
[9998.42s -> 9999.06s]  Damn it.
[9999.06s -> 10000.58s]  That's frustrating.
[10000.58s -> 10001.06s]  Oh, well.
[10001.70s -> 10016.55s]  Because I bought the recipe already.
[10016.55s -> 10017.43s]  Just do it again.
[10020.10s -> 10026.98s]  What's going on now?
[10026.98s -> 10028.90s]  I bought the baked potato,
[10028.90s -> 10029.70s]  and I was going to say,
[10029.70s -> 10030.82s]  what the hell is happening?
[10033.16s -> 10034.12s]  Sandbox mode.
[10039.32s -> 10040.44s]  Let's try Sam.
[10040.44s -> 10041.72s]  What about the auto save?
[10041.72s -> 10043.80s]  And we have to do that whole day again.
[10044.44s -> 10045.88s]  What's the difference between these two?
[10046.52s -> 10048.36s]  Is there a difference?
[10051.80s -> 10052.92s]  I don't think you get recipes here.
[10052.92s -> 10054.20s]  I don't think you get orders.
[10059.77s -> 10060.41s]  Yeah, this is just...
[10061.85s -> 10062.81s]  There's nothing here.
[10062.81s -> 10063.77s]  You just destroy the kitchen.
[10065.19s -> 10066.47s]  You just have infinite meats.
[10067.11s -> 10068.23s]  There's no order.
[10088.78s -> 10090.62s]  I'm so sad right now.
[10090.62s -> 10095.54s]  I'm trying to cook the propane.
[10095.54s -> 10096.26s]  There we go.
[10096.26s -> 10105.53s]  Is this going to work?
[10106.49s -> 10108.33s]  Let the propane simmer.
[10108.33s -> 10114.23s]  Why is this not exploded?
[10114.23s -> 10117.53s]  Yeah, hold on here.
[10117.53s -> 10120.12s]  Just get a little bit of rice vinegar on here.
[10133.53s -> 10134.73s]  All right, looks good.
[10134.73s -> 10147.19s]  How about some of this oregano?
[10147.19s -> 10147.83s]  Sounds good.
[10148.39s -> 10156.84s]  How do I get this to blow up?
[10181.30s -> 10190.82s]  What the fuck?
[10190.82s -> 10201.10s]  No, get it in the oven.
[10201.10s -> 10202.38s]  Get a blow torch.
[10202.38s -> 10206.25s]  All right, give me utensils.
[10208.66s -> 10209.38s]  Knife.
[10209.38s -> 10211.02s]  Spatula.
[10211.02s -> 10212.92s]  Sponge.
[10212.92s -> 10214.52s]  Just knife and just start stabbing it?
[10214.52s -> 10215.56s]  Blow torch.
[10215.56s -> 10229.77s]  Okay, now let's...
[10237.26s -> 10238.70s]  Like, Jesus Christ.
[10238.70s -> 10239.98s]  Let's get the fuck out of me.
[10240.46s -> 10245.88s]  I didn't think it was going to happen.
[10245.88s -> 10252.49s]  This shit was on the stove for like five minutes and it didn't blow up.
[10252.49s -> 10253.29s]  All right, I need to...
[10253.29s -> 10254.81s]  I'm going to go play the game.
[10254.81s -> 10257.29s]  I have to reload this stupid soft lock.
[10257.85s -> 10260.87s]  Throw the pizzas out the window.
[10260.87s -> 10263.14s]  Yeah, I'm just going to microwave a bunch of fruits.
[10266.02s -> 10267.62s]  Microwave a pumpkin.
[10267.62s -> 10303.05s]  Does this happen if you put a pumpkin in the microwave?
[10303.77s -> 10309.93s]  Oh, it's making noises I don't like.
[10310.65s -> 10314.38s]  Microwave some metal.
[10333.43s -> 10334.39s]  All right, that's half it.
[10334.39s -> 10341.19s]  This is like going to like irradiate the room.
[10341.19s -> 10344.57s]  If you touch that right now, you would like turn to stone.
[10344.57s -> 10345.21s]  Can I pick it up?
[10345.85s -> 10346.81s]  Oh, I can.
[10346.81s -> 10369.85s]  There we go.
[10369.85s -> 10370.89s]  Why is it still working?
[10376.44s -> 10378.12s]  Steam is coming out of the top but...
[10378.84s -> 10396.73s]  Holy shit, it actually makes a fire.
[10396.73s -> 10399.90s]  Does the fire spread?
[10399.90s -> 10400.70s]  Is it like the Sims?
[10423.27s -> 10424.39s]  Pumpkin is black.
[10434.84s -> 10436.95s]  All right, what would it take for you to eat this?
[10446.82s -> 10451.78s]  That shouldn't be able to...
[10451.78s -> 10456.89s]  I need more fire.
[10456.89s -> 10462.02s]  I need more explosive shit.
[10462.02s -> 10466.39s]  No, come here.
[10466.39s -> 10467.03s]  Drop it right here.
[10471.69s -> 10472.25s]  All right, burn.
[10472.81s -> 10473.53s]  Fire.
[10473.53s -> 10488.71s]  Here we go.
[10488.71s -> 10489.83s]  All right, we got a fire.
[10489.83s -> 10494.38s]  Oh, come on.
[10494.38s -> 10495.10s]  Stop.
[10495.10s -> 10499.98s]  Come on.
[10499.98s -> 10501.18s]  Why can you not blow these up?
[10508.97s -> 10510.41s]  Can I fry-a-late it?
[10510.41s -> 10513.70s]  I'm gonna deep fry a propane tank.
[10515.10s -> 10516.30s]  That's perfectly safe.
[10524.41s -> 10525.37s]  There's no oil in there.
[10525.37s -> 10528.66s]  Oh, I'll get oil.
[10528.66s -> 10530.02s]  What's the worst oil in the world?
[10537.42s -> 10537.92s]  Huh?
[10539.38s -> 10541.78s]  It's got like a bomb dropped on me.
[10546.66s -> 10551.34s]  Lime juice, soy sauce, which what has a high olive oil?
[10551.34s -> 10566.84s]  Yeah.
[10566.84s -> 10568.36s]  Okay, everything's fine.
[10568.36s -> 10569.91s]  We're good to go.
[10569.91s -> 10571.43s]  Turn every oven on.
[10571.43s -> 10573.48s]  Is this what the last guy did?
[10573.48s -> 10574.44s]  It's still cooking.
[10575.16s -> 10583.29s]  Torch the place.
[10583.29s -> 10584.01s]  Let's go.
[10584.01s -> 10596.41s]  Come on, blow up.
[10596.41s -> 10597.29s]  What's with this fire?
[10597.85s -> 10612.36s]  I'm trying to like burn my eyes.
[10613.64s -> 10614.84s]  Turn it around this way.
[10637.30s -> 10649.29s]  My face in here.
[10649.29s -> 10649.85s]  Why is it...
[10649.85s -> 10652.01s]  Wait, that just exploded.
[10652.01s -> 10653.45s]  Why is it gas coming in?
[10655.03s -> 10658.15s]  I threw a cucumber and it exploded.
[10658.15s -> 10658.87s]  It's a grenade?
[10661.30s -> 10662.82s]  All right, that was fun.
[10662.82s -> 10664.90s]  I need to like go play the fucking game now.
[10666.06s -> 10667.82s]  Is that enough for me to forget what happened?
[10669.03s -> 10669.99s]  Where was...
[10669.99s -> 10679.90s]  Where did I buy the recipe?
[10679.90s -> 10681.26s]  The lore was just getting good.
[10681.26s -> 10682.62s]  Okay, I have here and here.
[10684.34s -> 10685.22s]  Do I not have...
[10685.22s -> 10686.18s]  Is quicksave broken?
[10686.18s -> 10687.30s]  Do I not have a save before?
[10692.95s -> 10693.51s]  This is the...
[10694.79s -> 10696.81s]  Is the autosave dead?
[10696.81s -> 10697.29s]  Let me check.
[10703.16s -> 10704.04s]  Are both dead?
[10704.84s -> 10705.64s]  They're not.
[10705.64s -> 10706.44s]  I don't think they are.
[10711.03s -> 10711.83s]  They're not both dead.
[10714.84s -> 10716.92s]  We just have to do the day before again.
[10717.56s -> 10718.76s]  All right, let me like go get...
[10718.76s -> 10719.72s]  Let me get a glass of water.
[10720.86s -> 10721.50s]  I'll be right back.
[10722.14s -> 10723.26s]  We're just gonna pretend we didn't do...
[10727.42s -> 10728.46s]  And make a bug report.
[10732.04s -> 10732.52s]  Dad, don't worry.
[10732.52s -> 10733.72s]  I'll mute the music for you.
[10733.72s -> 10734.28s]  We'll fix it.
[10734.28s -> 10734.84s]  All right, I'll be right back.
[10734.84s -> 10735.56s]  Let's get a glass of water.
[10736.12s -> 10737.70s]  Hopefully we can get through this quickly.
[10738.34s -> 10740.47s]  I'll be right back.
[10740.47s -> 10940.32s]  Hey.
[10945.08s -> 10946.04s]  All right, let's try this again.
[10947.85s -> 10952.90s]  As severely disappointed as I am that we have to do this third time.
[10952.90s -> 10953.94s]  Because this is number three.
[10953.94s -> 10955.14s]  This is three strikes, you're up.
[10955.78s -> 10964.10s]  This will be strike three coming up.
[10969.66s -> 10974.81s]  The first time it went through the floor, my pan, and I had to restart.
[10974.81s -> 10976.17s]  Second time, I got softlocked.
[10976.17s -> 10976.97s]  Third time, let's see.
[10977.53s -> 10979.37s]  All right, we're good.
[10979.37s -> 10983.83s]  This is prep.
[10983.83s -> 10984.79s]  Oh, what do I need to do?
[10985.51s -> 10986.63s]  For a second, I thought all the...
[10986.63s -> 10987.59s]  This place was exploded.
[10987.59s -> 10988.23s]  It's not.
[10988.23s -> 10988.87s]  All right, repair.
[10989.51s -> 10994.54s]  I've been waiting years for this game.
[10996.71s -> 10999.51s]  Yeah, well, I was waiting like at least a few months.
[10999.51s -> 11003.53s]  It's fine, 28 seconds.
[11004.17s -> 11009.53s]  Kitchen Nightmares OST.
[11014.15s -> 11018.63s]  No, okay, I will put on the Kitchen Nightmares American OST.
[11018.63s -> 11021.30s]  When we get to a new level.
[11021.30s -> 11026.63s]  By the way, the Kitchen Nightmares OST is just every American reality show OST.
[11029.70s -> 11033.70s]  Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[11034.97s -> 11036.17s]  I hate watching those shows.
[11040.55s -> 11042.95s]  Five community subs just came in from Anonymous, thank you.
[11043.51s -> 11049.75s]  Whoever you are.
[11049.75s -> 11050.55s]  Oh, I gotta play.
[11050.55s -> 11051.51s]  Okay, what would...
[11052.07s -> 11053.03s]  I only got a minute, fuck.
[11057.24s -> 11057.80s]  Is this clean?
[11059.22s -> 11060.42s]  No, there's a blend in here.
[11072.46s -> 11075.66s]  All right, giving this another shot.
[11075.66s -> 11077.18s]  We keep doing Groundhog Day.
[11077.74s -> 11079.77s]  What did I...
[11079.77s -> 11082.01s]  Oh, fuck, this is before the...
[11083.21s -> 11084.73s]  I had all the stuff ready to go to.
[11085.83s -> 11086.87s]  Why game?

[28915.26s -> 28928.89s]  all right it's been eight hours it's time to go i can't break them okay get the mop yeah once
[28928.89s -> 28973.64s]  i start like pretending to be a child it's time to this really is a kid it's like you're gonna

[28990.73s -> 29006.97s]  i gotta get out of here guys i've gone fucking absolutely out of my mind it's over
[29006.97s -> 29035.19s]  serve the bread out the window oh my god all right that's it oh i gotta kill that audio
[29035.19s -> 29048.74s]  oh my god that was too that was too much so i think i'm gonna play this again i i'm not done
[29048.74s -> 29056.63s]  with my floor soup empire but we're gonna take a break from it because we actually might be able
[29056.63s -> 29063.91s]  to play it again very soon because of e3 because as of uh the microsoft conference is the next
[29063.91s -> 29074.15s]  time you'll see me live which is sunday sunday at uh 4 p.m eastern so 1 p.m pacific
[29074.15s -> 29084.70s]  so i'll be live at one o'clock maybe like 12 30 just like to but the reason why i might be able
[29084.70s -> 29089.48s]  to play this is because isn't there a there's like a two or three hour break between
[29089.48s -> 29096.47s]  microsoft and bethesda right so during that break i'll just play this and then we'll do
[29096.47s -> 29102.33s]  the bethesda conference that makes sense right i don't know how long it is in between
[29106.10s -> 29109.14s]  uh why didn't i why did i not light the kitchen on fire i did earlier
[29112.14s -> 29120.09s]  oh my goodness it's a four hour break that's that's perfect so the next time you'll see me
[29120.09s -> 29124.09s]  you'll see me uh for the microsoft conference i'm gonna go grab some food after pretending

[29566.95s -> 29572.58s]  the customer isn't going to know if they do find out and they do know
[29573.38s -> 29579.62s]  the whole place shuts off forever so that's why and the customer doesn't have a window

[29726.25s -> 29739.21s]  dollars and fifty cents have you ever had hers cheddar horseradish chips i've not are they good
[29741.18s -> 29745.02s]  i'll buy them the next time at the grocery store are they available because that sounds
[29745.02s -> 29755.75s]  pretty good i love horseradish i like it on sushi because that's what you're putting on
[29755.75s -> 29761.86s]  your sushi essentially most of the wasabi that you put on sushi is actually just
[29761.86s -> 29765.22s]  green horseradish i just ruined i blew you mind right there didn't i
[29773.19s -> 29786.66s]  yeah not really no it is real wasabi is yeah it's pretty rare they have it in some places
[29787.22s -> 29805.42s]  if you eat sushi at 7-eleven no what that's a thing but i didn't serve sushi at 7-eleven
[29805.42s -> 29815.32s]  that's against the law at this point you can't legally have sushi at 7-eleven they still do
[29817.11s -> 29825.72s]  no no they don't has anyone ever bought sushi from 7-eleven and if you have why
[29825.80s -> 29828.92s]  there had to have been a reason you were dared by it you got it you lost a bet
[29830.38s -> 29838.66s]  everyone that buys sushi from 7-eleven lost a bet previously that's how they make all their money
[29839.46s -> 29867.37s]  is on lost bets i have i was hungry i was still hungry after puking oh that's too bad i'm i'm
[29867.37s -> 29874.73s]  of the opinion though i might sound a little elitist here but unless i see the person making
[29874.73s -> 29881.22s]  the sushi unless i order the sushi and they do it right now right there i'm not gonna eat it who
[29881.22s -> 29884.42s]  knows somebody could have like stuck another tag on it add like the grocery store there's a
[29884.42s -> 29890.74s]  grocery store sushi all right maybe but if it's just sitting in a box hey here's some salmon
[29890.74s -> 29894.87s]  sushi how long has it been there for has it been on the fucking ground in a bowl for more
[29894.87s -> 29901.22s]  than four days i know somebody that's done that personally very much so i know them very well
[29901.78s -> 29906.39s]  who knows how long they could have been in there yes they have standards
[29907.27s -> 29911.19s]  but i want to see the person i want to order it and have it done and given to me in like less than
[29911.19s -> 29926.34s]  an hour raw food i don't mess around with raw food i eat sushi i like i really like sushi
[29926.98s -> 29932.76s]  but i don't mess around with raw food steak tartar i will don't i won't even touch it i
[29932.76s -> 29938.04s]  won't even be in the same room if you have steak tartar in a room and you invite me over
[29938.04s -> 29942.12s]  it's i'm gonna be like a vampire i'm not gonna be able to go in the room it's gonna
[29942.12s -> 29960.10s]  be like a satan going into a church like i like skin will start to burn but yeah sushi's great
[29960.82s -> 29972.98s]  i wonder what my favorite sushi roll is anybody know can somebody guess have i ever said it on
[29972.98s -> 29983.26s]  stream i don't think i have it's not california roll no you got it somebody got it i have two
[29983.26s -> 29991.40s]  or three favorite rolls philadelphia roll is in my top three spicy tuna is probably number one
[29992.97s -> 30005.08s]  and number three is uh debatable it's out there somewhere but spicy tuna is my favorite
[30005.96s -> 30018.89s]  especially if they do spicy tuna with like avocado on it it's so good but yeah with flakes
[30018.89s -> 30026.33s]  tempura flakes now you just make me want to get a spicy tuna roll uh there's a sushi
[30026.33s -> 30033.70s]  called philadelphia roll yes philadelphia roll is raw salmon and cream cheese rolled up with
[30033.70s -> 30041.62s]  um but usually what cucumber in it too now people that are going whoa that's gross um
[30042.82s -> 30047.86s]  you know bagel locks you never had like cream cheese locks and bagels before
[30048.50s -> 30059.42s]  it's kind of the same idea you never had a bagel with locks and cream cheese on it
[30059.42s -> 30067.13s]  that's fantastic too if you have never had it smoked salmon cream cheese yeah that's
[30067.13s -> 30071.05s]  it's the same idea it's just the it's a sushi roll and the salmon is raw
[30076.55s -> 30081.19s]  in other words the fish in spicy tuna isn't regulated quality and cut tuna doesn't have to
[30081.19s -> 30101.34s]  fall into an fda quality control because it's a minced meat mixed in sauce uh what yeah but when
[30101.34s -> 30108.73s]  i go to like nice sushi places that you can kind of you can like see them making it they don't
[30108.73s -> 30117.78s]  do they don't like scoop it up like an ice cream scoop usually i usually eat it it's a
[30117.78s -> 30125.94s]  sham i've actually been to a place before that had sushi and they the spicy tuna was
[30125.94s -> 30133.38s]  scooped up with an ice cream scoop and i immediately was like i'm gonna eat that but
[30133.38s -> 30143.94s]  i'm not gonna come back i still ate it and it was fine now you think now that you say that i
[30144.50s -> 30159.78s]  yeah they do a lot of ice cream scoop spicy tuna interesting i'm not even like ever again
[30162.71s -> 30174.87s]  except from the places that i know do it right i do like like uh simply this tuna sashimi
[30175.67s -> 30182.79s]  the nice dark almost purple fatty tuna it's really good with wasabi on it and that stuff's
[30182.87s -> 30198.30s]  real because i mean it is that doesn't come out of an ice cream scoop you see the guy like
[30201.18s -> 30203.74s]  two sword with two fucking big blades in his hands
[30207.50s -> 30210.38s]  and he picks up the thing and he starts sliding carving
[30212.41s -> 30218.22s]  carve and he puts on eat it that shit's real they don't make that up that's not a
[30218.30s -> 30236.86s]  stuffed animal what if it is but let's move on i think we've got them from cheddar horse radish
[30236.86s -> 30242.04s]  horse radish chips i will definitely try them hey podcast listener thanks for four bucks

[30355.98s -> 30367.40s]  dreams about me it's the same this you didn't you have like two dreams about me already
[30367.40s -> 30370.12s]  this is this is like i think this is dream at least number two is three
[30373.50s -> 30378.54s]  you were a pirate captain and i was a member of your crew we were looking for the infinity
[30378.54s -> 30385.02s]  stones and we had followed a map to this one specific island i immediately found all six under
[30385.02s -> 30394.17s]  a rock brought them to you and asked you to put me in the rumble you got super mad and
[30394.17s -> 30412.07s]  then i woke up thanks for the infinity stones can i be in the rumble the hardest decisions
[30412.63s -> 30423.22s]  takes the strongest of all decisions and then i fucking push you also seriously wendy's
[30423.22s -> 30426.26s]  mcdonald's and burger king aren't you forgetting one taco themed restaurant taco

[30483.03s -> 30490.07s]  earlier that's weird it's confusing anyways a taco bell is not a burger restaurant it is a taco
[30490.07s -> 30493.75s]  restaurant therefore it is compared with other taco restaurants which there are not very many
[30493.75s -> 30500.39s]  fast food taco places there are some but i digress and they say put me in the rumble

[30996.60s -> 31003.98s]  least this week right how'd the colonoscopy go oh for those of you that didn't hear about it
[31005.34s -> 31013.08s]  it went well i the doctor doesn't have any major concerns they took a few biopsies which
[31013.08s -> 31021.96s]  is why i spent an extra day or so away from the stream and just kind of wanted to reassure
[31021.96s -> 31028.66s]  myself a few things so the biopsies will come back in a couple weeks and again he doesn't
[31028.66s -> 31033.99s]  have any major concerns but it's always nice to know the results of those but yeah it went
[31033.99s -> 31045.05s]  well where was i the youngest person in the clinic um not not not that i don't really remember i
[31045.05s -> 31049.77s]  wasn't really paying that much attention to other people i was kind of just remember i hadn't really
[31049.77s -> 31057.96s]  eaten solid food in almost two days so i didn't really care who was in the clinic i was just
[31057.96s -> 31064.79s]  wanted to get it over with it was more about just focus and get in there and let me get out
[31064.79s -> 31074.71s]  of here and be done but no it went well uh a couple more bits are came in here a little
[31074.71s -> 31084.02s]  bit earlier we had uh ragarnoi for the two dollars and i fucked that up you cook your
[31084.02s -> 31093.14s]  cooking is like watching someone give birth directly to a woodchipper all right that was
[31093.14s -> 31108.73s]  worth reading that was good thank you for the bits there uh short stack thanks for five
[31108.81s -> 31112.73s]  dollars been too busy to watch the streams lately but cooking sim was such a fun game to come back
[31112.73s -> 31119.64s]  to thanks for the laughs king i i mean i gotta address the fact that you just called me the
[31119.64s -> 31128.52s]  king i mean king hey i mean hopefully i'm good to the people here i appreciate it though thank
[31128.52s -> 31135.26s]  you for the five dollars uh unicorn butt crumbs thanks for two dollars and fifty cents hey
[31135.26s -> 31140.38s]  jeremy been watching you for about seven years now since the early days of youtube you never
[31140.38s -> 31146.62s]  fail to put a smile on my face buddy i've been struggling a lot with uh ssri withdrawals
[31146.62s -> 31151.34s]  and your streams are a nice escape from my crazily imbalanced brain love all your content
[31151.34s -> 31157.02s]  creating and passion for what you do got a question for you okay which fictional character
[31157.02s -> 31162.92s]  has had the biggest impact on your life fictional character that has had the biggest
[31162.92s -> 31188.74s]  impact in my life um honestly probably probably ren and stimpy if i'm completely and totally
[31188.74s -> 31195.91s]  honest because that like shaped everything about like the way that i wanted to think was funny
[31195.91s -> 31205.45s]  and the way that i was and imitation and ran and stimpy both those two would just characters
[31205.45s -> 31219.38s]  that you only get to pick one ren is ren is definitely not stimpy it's ren always ran
[31219.38s -> 31234.84s]  stimpy is cool but ren was the clear clear anchor of the whole show uh ren was the little
[31234.84s -> 31242.97s]  chihuahua i mean i guess a better i mean you say fictional character but billy west is not
[31242.97s -> 31248.33s]  a fictional character that's the person that did all the voices for ren stimpy doug he did
[31248.33s -> 31253.13s]  almost every voice on futurama billy west is probably like the reason why i'm the kind of
[31253.13s -> 31261.32s]  person that i am billy west jim carrey um a couple other probably cartoon actors probably
[31261.88s -> 31267.69s]  but yeah billy west was doing all a majority of those characters when i was growing up
[31268.25s -> 31274.97s]  and he was so good and he was he was so interesting the way that he would put stuff
[31274.97s -> 31278.65s]  together in the way that he would talk and how we would roll sentences together it was
[31278.65s -> 31286.38s]  it was fascinating and probably uh charlie adler too if you want to know who charlie
[31286.38s -> 31295.99s]  adler is um ed big head uh the satan from cow and chicken uh ikus from ah real monsters
[31298.55s -> 31303.75s]  just so talented just could do anything with his voice it was just he could go up he could go
[31303.75s -> 31317.37s]  down he was so good yeah like the ass devil guy yeah yeah i think he had an actual name
[31317.37s -> 31334.22s]  was he just devil but there you go i did a kind of a wordy answer there but i'm really
[31334.22s -> 31342.74s]  sorry to hear about your having withdrawals here and if i can be something fun or something
[31342.74s -> 31351.75s]  interesting that you can relax to or have fun with i say it a lot but it's that's great
[31351.75s -> 31356.39s]  for me that's great for this community that means a lot to me that's like that's great
[31356.39s -> 31361.48s]  for me to hear that because i would never want somebody to come and watch this channel and then
[31361.48s -> 31366.79s]  say that's this is not good this was that i didn't like that this made me like
[31366.79s -> 31370.31s]  uncomfortable this made me feel like shit i don't want you to like feel like shit after
[31370.31s -> 31378.95s]  the stream i don't want you to leave this stream like mad or upset or angry or not having fun you
[31378.95s -> 31384.58s]  know what i'm saying i don't want you to feel bad so knowing that if you feel people tell
[31384.58s -> 31392.04s]  me that they feel good that's a win for me like i feel great hearing that it wins not really
[31392.04s -> 31410.47s]  the right word but i mean maybe it is floor soup was uncomfortable yeah and i know like
[31410.47s -> 31416.20s]  honestly like we fuck around a lot on these streams but it's to a point where we're
[31417.14s -> 31426.01s]  it you know what i mean that i can't really put it into words the floor soup made me
[31426.01s -> 31437.06s]  uneasy yeah but you didn't leave you still here floor soup was pissing me off it was
[31438.18s -> 31446.81s]  hey it's just soup on the floor it's a clean floor it doesn't where else was i going to put
[31446.81s -> 31457.27s]  it i almost screwed hey i'm having a moment here okay i'm having a little moment here i'm
[31457.27s -> 31473.74s]  trying to like tell you and i care about you sport anyways that's gonna be it i will see you guys
[31474.54s -> 31480.47s]  for the microsoft conference i'll probably be live 20-ish minutes before the conference so i can
[31480.47s -> 31485.70s]  get set up and we can hang out and remember last time i did this i was like 10 minutes late and
[31485.70s -> 31489.78s]  i was like in a bathrobe with wet hair from the shower i'm gonna try to avoid that this
[31489.78s -> 31516.14s]  time that is sunday let's see e3 microsoft so that it's at 4 p.m eastern so let me let me
[31516.14s -> 31521.02s]  get a good look here i'm not doing the ea play live i feel like that's not gonna be anything
[31521.02s -> 31530.62s]  worth covering microsoft is sunday at 4 p.m eastern so 1 p.m pacific so like 12 30 pacific
[31530.62s -> 31536.30s]  on sunday is when the stream is probably i'd say between like 12 and 1 p.m pacific and stream
[31536.30s -> 31544.98s]  will turn on and then bethesda is four hours later so depending how long the microsoft
[31544.98s -> 31555.45s]  conference goes we'll play uh kitchen flipper for a couple hours or so and then there's also
[31555.45s -> 31559.83s]  i probably probably won't do devolver because i probably at that point would have been
[31559.83s -> 31569.72s]  streaming for almost 10 hours so i'll probably take off after the bethesda conference four five
[31569.72s -> 31572.84s]  six seven eight nine ten no actually never mind i'm reading this wrong it'd be like
[31572.84s -> 31581.91s]  maybe not we'll see how it goes because that would only be six hours or so so yeah we'll
[31581.91s -> 31587.83s]  just play it by your sunday between 12 and 1 pacific the stream will turn on we'll do
[31587.83s -> 31593.19s]  the conferences and we'll hang out and that's pretty much the next time you're gonna see me
[31593.19s -> 31595.99s]  have a great rest of your night take care guys thanks for hanging out hope you enjoyed
[31595.99s -> 31602.49s]  it that game was fun and i had a lot of fun hope you did too take care everybody have
[31602.49s -> 31608.14s]  a great rest of your night and have a good weekend too because i won't see you until sunday
