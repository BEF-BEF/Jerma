[0.76s -> 9.24s]  Hello, how's everybody doing? Hope you're having a good day. I'm having a pretty good day.
[11.96s -> 21.08s]  I'm a little sloppy right now. That's because I just got out of an MRI and those are always fun.
[21.88s -> 27.16s]  And this time I had to get contrast. They put an IV in and they pump you full of
[27.16s -> 32.04s]  fucking squid ink. Whatever the hell it is. And then you, uh, they get a good image.
[33.00s -> 39.26s]  So I'm a little sloppy right now. That's why we're late. That's why we went head to stream today.
[39.26s -> 43.98s]  Yesterday, uh, anything before actually, uh, Otto had a surgical procedure done to
[46.78s -> 49.98s]  all over the place. And then I got a lot of stuff going on the next few days too.
[51.26s -> 60.38s]  Uh, a lot of things going on. I'm glad I did that 13 hour Lord of the Rings fuckface stream
[61.26s -> 69.37s]  because yeah, that, that, that was like three streams. Thankfully, because then that the next
[69.37s -> 73.45s]  few days, obviously I wasn't around and then juggling streams the rest of this week.
[74.49s -> 83.61s]  Is Otto okay? Otto was fine completely, but he had to have surgery and then I had to have an MRI.
[86.31s -> 89.59s]  And then there's all kinds of IRL stuff that I don't, I'm not really going to talk about
[89.59s -> 94.42s]  because they don't need to be talked about. So yeah, we're going to just chill out today.
[94.42s -> 96.42s]  I wasn't sure if I was going to, here comes the hype train.
[96.42s -> 115.51s]  Oh my God, colonoscopy too. I probably sound fucked up a little bit because
[117.02s -> 121.10s]  stuff just messes with me. Well, I like mom. My mouth tastes weird.
[121.98s -> 131.90s]  I like fingers were like cold. I have an MRI fear. If you didn't know while the hype train continues
[131.90s -> 138.34s]  to throw hundreds and hundreds of dollars at this stream. Every time I go to an MRI machine,
[138.34s -> 143.62s]  I always think I've had three MRIs think of my whole life. And when I go do them,
[143.62s -> 147.46s]  I always have this weird panic where I go, Oh, wait, hold on a second. What did, but
[148.42s -> 152.02s]  there could be metal in me. They might be metal inside my body. I don't know.
[152.98s -> 158.15s]  Then you think of every single time I've ever had, boy, what about metal like in your eye?
[158.15s -> 164.15s]  I've ever had metal shavings in my eye. Have I ever been, have I ever been a welder? I don't know.
[164.15s -> 169.34s]  No, I don't think so. What about my teeth? Do my teeth have any metal in them? If I ever had a,
[169.58s -> 176.66s]  my teeth gonna rip out because I've had a filling. And then when you're in the machine that like,
[179.74s -> 183.42s]  you can feel your hair is kind of standing up. And I'm like, is this teeth?
[184.14s -> 192.39s]  Is this when the teeth come out? Cause I can feel it. The magnets just running around you. It's a,
[192.39s -> 201.78s]  it's a shitty experience. But yeah, I have this weird irrational fear that wait, hold on,
[201.78s -> 206.58s]  check my pockets again. Do I have, what about the rings where the loops, you know, you know,
[206.58s -> 212.66s]  your pants, the thing you tie your pants with, not a belt. If you have jogging pants on that
[212.66s -> 219.26s]  little belt pant loop thing, there's a little metal ring. No, no, not a belt. The thing,
[219.26s -> 225.19s]  when you wear jogging pants, drawstring, there it is. No, not a belt. Yeah. Drawstring. I know this
[225.19s -> 232.46s]  word. It at on where the drawstrings connect to go through the pants to actually go around your body.
[232.46s -> 237.02s]  It's like a little metal ring here. And it's like, am I going to get sucked up to the top of the
[237.02s -> 244.95s]  machine like a cartoon? And then obviously the answer is no. We're already on level four,
[244.95s -> 254.23s]  the hype train too, which is fucking ridiculous. Now, obviously I don't know these things. I don't,
[254.23s -> 260.82s]  I don't think these things are actually going to happen, but they're, the teeth thing does
[260.82s -> 270.10s]  freak me out a little. Are we just doing a relaxing screen? Yes, we are. We're just going to hang out.
[270.10s -> 273.62s]  We're going to chill. We're going to play this game. Sorry if my voice sounds a little strange.
[274.34s -> 281.45s]  Um, it's a little raspy. I don't know why. I think it's just kind of, my body might be a little
[281.45s -> 290.49s]  stressed. I don't know. But thank you everybody for the third hype train in a row. Third time.
[291.13s -> 303.46s]  You guys are fucking ridiculous. Please don't, please don't die. I don't plan on it. I don't
[303.46s -> 308.23s]  have a plan. I don't think that's going to happen. I don't plan on that, but I don't know. I could,
[310.10s -> 313.94s]  I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what he plans on it. What are you doing? Don't say that.
[313.94s -> 320.38s]  Hype train complete. We just completed the hype train. Thanks a lot guys. Hype train.
[321.58s -> 330.01s]  Level four. The game we're going to play is Kingsway. It's a medieval OS. And yes,
[330.01s -> 334.87s]  you heard that right. It's got, somebody said it's like hypnospace outlaw, but it's an RPG.
[335.59s -> 339.86s]  So we're going to be something we can just relax with and play. And then tomorrow,
[340.82s -> 347.78s]  tomorrow is going to be an early, early stream. We're going to do an EU stream tomorrow and it's
[347.78s -> 356.01s]  probably going to be rhythm heaven somewhere around 11 to 12 Pacific. AM is tomorrow's stream.
[356.57s -> 361.61s]  I was thinking about doing rhythm heaven tonight, but I just, I'm not, I can't,
[362.79s -> 366.79s]  I can't, I got like this thing wrapped around my arm because of the IV and like, I'm just,
[366.79s -> 371.75s]  I feel like kind of shitty. So I'd rather not wave my arms around and have sing songs and shit,
[371.75s -> 376.31s]  but we'll do that tomorrow. That sounds like a plan tomorrow. EU stream tomorrow.
[377.19s -> 390.90s]  But without further ado, as hype train continues to leave the station, let's get over here. He's
[390.90s -> 398.31s]  feeling a little shitty. I mean a little, a little, just like tired and I don't know, annoyed. You
[398.31s -> 401.91s]  know what I'm talking about? Anytime you go to the doctor is the day that you're going to be annoyed.
[402.63s -> 407.19s]  It doesn't matter. You can feel fantastic before going in. You're just going to be annoyed
[407.19s -> 417.18s]  afterwards. And here we go. So again, this is a operating system, a medieval operating system.
[417.90s -> 428.04s]  Did I dip on Joel twice? And Joel hasn't said anything to me as me. Me and Joel don't talk
[428.04s -> 434.87s]  unless like a stream is currently on. That's like kind of how it works. The last like three weeks,
[434.87s -> 439.91s]  like if one of our streams is turned on, then like, oh, then, okay. Hey Joel, hey,
[439.99s -> 447.61s]  oh, day German. What's up, man? The, our last conversation on discord was like,
[447.61s -> 456.86s]  let's see. Yeah. Last Sunday. Yo man, you still, you want to take a day off. I heard you stream
[456.86s -> 468.30s]  for like 12 hours. See, he's looking out for me. He's looking out for me. Actually. Hey,
[469.10s -> 472.70s]  the only time that me and Joel talk is when the streams live. So I'm going to say, I'm going to,
[472.70s -> 478.87s]  let's reply. Let's ready. How about this one? Hey dude. And then in brackets, yo, streams on. So
[478.87s -> 482.86s]  like, don't, like, don't, what do you mean? It's like he's going to say something. Hey,
[482.86s -> 494.12s]  hey, dude, the mother streams on streams on. Don't say your credit card number out loud.
[496.25s -> 506.86s]  All right. I'm going to say, Hey dude, um, I'm around for this weekend. EU. If you could believe
[506.86s -> 517.13s]  it. And I'm going to write that EU. If you could believe it, what say you on a return to keep
[517.21s -> 529.19s]  talking. Why am I saying it like this? All right. I sent it message sent. Let's see if we'll get
[529.19s -> 541.96s]  back for an email later. My dearest Joel, I must ask you. Okay. New adventure of the slight member.
[541.96s -> 547.94s]  This is an operating system. Let's go to make sure everything's correct. No, no, no setting.
[549.24s -> 554.47s]  Do I want to curse a trail? Every time I ever had this on the old windows, it, I just,
[554.47s -> 558.95s]  it was like a drug simulation. I just feel like I, I feel like this is not, I've done it like this.
[558.95s -> 566.12s]  I'm on drugs. I don't like that. You would have, I'm on drugs or my computer sucks.
[569.06s -> 576.18s]  All right. This is, I'm on drugs or integrated graphics card. I don't, all of these are bad.
[576.74s -> 584.86s]  We're going with this. Don't, I'm not doing the drugs. No. What about background?
[587.19s -> 595.98s]  Did you do it? Level five hype train has been completed. How many hundreds of subs and
[595.98s -> 599.42s]  hundreds of thousands of hundreds of thousands of dollars have come in?
[604.20s -> 610.20s]  There it is. Hype train success hog jam. Thanks a lot guys. You guys never cease to fucking amaze
[610.20s -> 615.64s]  me with how much money you pour into the stream on a daily basis. Even when the channel is not live,
[616.84s -> 625.16s]  a hundred subs and 5,700 bits in just the last 10 minutes. You guys are fucking insane.
[626.12s -> 632.12s]  Should I do pink? No, I don't like that. No, I don't like that. No, actually pink is okay.
[634.12s -> 646.82s]  Did you do windows 3.1? Purple, purple, purple, purple, purple. No, I don't like that either.
[647.70s -> 655.91s]  I like this one. No, this one's nighttime. It's time for sleep time. No, the default is okay. Dark.
[656.95s -> 666.39s]  I don't like the dark theme. All right. This one's fine. Or no, that's, you know, this is more chill.
[666.47s -> 673.03s]  I'll take it. Notifications. Sure. Sound, main volume. I don't really know what this
[673.03s -> 679.67s]  means yet. Screen. An 80. Yeah, I don't have a 4k monitor. Can't fucking laugh in my face.
[680.87s -> 690.57s]  New adventure. Name. You can have a random name? You guys even hear this? Oh shit, I'm an idiot.
[691.29s -> 705.50s]  There you go. Okay. Do we do random? Open juice. Open Dion. Bruno Hill. Mushy Sherry. Jack Twain.
[707.34s -> 720.12s]  Dr. Milk. Jam Trey. Joan Cramp. You're Already. Paul Gifts. Ivan Yu. I like Ivan Yu.
[720.84s -> 733.72s]  His classes in this game? Zach Last. Dr. Milk. Third Bonnet. Apple Jr. Read a book. Pearl Twain.
[733.72s -> 750.84s]  Stern Twain. Eugene Much. I like Ivan Hill. Pearl Socks. Alvin 5000. Done. Okay. Adventure. Well
[750.84s -> 754.76s]  rounded character. Not great at anything. Not bad at anything. Makes sense. Warrior. Strong
[754.76s -> 760.41s]  character. Skilled with heavy weapons and armor. Wise character focused on magic and light armor.
[761.53s -> 767.54s]  Agile master many. So do you. This is like you play this game in the operating system. It's weird.
[768.50s -> 772.70s]  Or beast skin. An odd character. Strong and tough but has a bad reputation.
[776.82s -> 784.33s]  I like mage. I'm a mage. Portrait. Okay. Eyes. Does it look like me?
[784.33s -> 803.29s]  That's bigger than that. Let's see. Okay.
[808.84s -> 817.80s]  Bowl cut. That looks all right. I don't have like an old face, do I? Should I do the mustache?
[821.16s -> 834.79s]  Head shape? I'm just making that one image that was made of me with the mustache. Okay.
[835.75s -> 852.54s]  I actually like it. Hold on. Let me see the other hairstyles. I like this. I like that one too.
[852.54s -> 869.77s]  These are all good. All of these are good. No not bald. That's too easy. That's too easy though.
[869.77s -> 877.98s]  It really is. How can you have different hair color when you have a bald head? Okay. But better
[877.98s -> 888.84s]  eyebrows? Do we have the concerned eyebrows? Okay. Eyebrows and beard. What about ears?
[890.74s -> 903.18s]  That's fine. What is custom? Oh you could import images. What? I don't have any custom images.
[906.68s -> 914.28s]  48 by 48? Do I have one of those? What do we do it? Do it. Import. How do you already have this?
[917.24s -> 925.00s]  That's not a 48 by 48 image. Yes we do. We do. Does somebody have a 48 by 48 picture of my face?
[925.80s -> 932.36s]  That's a number I've never heard before. Just draw one right now. One of your emotes. Well the
[932.36s -> 939.88s]  emotes are 50. They're not 48 by 48. Free size and emote. I've opened Photoshop. I don't want to
[939.88s -> 944.60s]  open up an Adobe program. Don't you know if you double click an Adobe program you're going to be
[944.60s -> 954.02s]  sitting there for four minutes while it opens? I don't have that kind of time. Just do it in paint.
[954.02s -> 962.42s]  All right. Hold on. What should I use? Every time I open up an Adobe program I feel like I'm working
[962.42s -> 968.23s]  at NASA. And it's like oh booting up the supercomputer. Why do you have to tell me everything you're
[968.23s -> 976.07s]  loading? I don't care. Just load. Adobe products have a loading screen that cycles through a
[976.07s -> 982.39s]  million different text files. Like loading this. It's like I don't need that information.
[982.39s -> 987.61s]  Just open it. Wait you have one already? In the time it took me to talk about Adobe?
[988.49s -> 999.59s]  Is that 48 by 48? Okay fine. This doesn't even matter. I don't think this matters.
[1000.15s -> 1004.97s]  All right well fine. Where is it? Where to go? Right there? Okay.
[1007.11s -> 1020.28s]  I need to hold on. Wait custom import. Why does it? It doesn't think this is an image.
[1021.16s -> 1030.79s]  How is this not an image? Please no. We're not just gonna we're not just gonna give.
[1032.39s -> 1041.48s]  I can't. Okay fine. Fine. Fine. That one is pretty. Is that 48 by 48?
[1042.12s -> 1061.30s]  All right. Okay. Okay. It works. It works. It works. What's this character?
[1062.34s -> 1073.94s]  Wait I can change the hair color? I can't believe this is actually a real image.
[1075.94s -> 1081.14s]  Okay when I when somebody first showed me this the first thing that I've read the comments. You
[1081.14s -> 1084.90s]  don't think I read comments. I sit there in my bed and I like bite my fingernails and I go what the
[1084.90s -> 1089.62s]  fuck are people saying? Somebody said I look like a default goldeneye enemy.
[1090.34s -> 1098.22s]  Or like a Nintendo 64 of NPC or something. And I was like ah I guess yeah that's true.
[1098.78s -> 1105.42s]  That is pretty true. All right Alvin 5000. Mage. Everyone gets the same world. I don't want to do
[1105.42s -> 1113.66s]  leaderboard. All right I'm pretty intelligent. This is accurate. Choose a starting gift plus
[1113.66s -> 1121.90s]  six health points, two magic points, or 20 gold. What's is more important? I don't know.
[1123.11s -> 1135.11s]  20 gold? It's 21 out of 20. Double click the world navigator to travel through the land of Kingsway.
[1136.47s -> 1143.64s]  Okay. What? The yellow circles on the map are math nodes.
[1144.92s -> 1147.96s]  Click a node to travel to its location or inspect it for more information.
[1154.31s -> 1157.91s]  Training room. Distance 112. Location boat.
[1157.91s -> 1166.76s]  Okay this is. There is a battle dummy.
[1167.72s -> 1171.40s]  Some locations have events that trigger when you arrive. You must deal with the event before you
[1171.40s -> 1177.02s]  can continue traveling. Okay. Attack?
[1181.03s -> 1185.51s]  When in a battle you can choose an available skill. Each skill has a special use
[1185.51s -> 1193.46s]  and some are faster than others. Press the skill to attack your target. To load it?
[1194.26s -> 1204.01s]  Alvin 5000 attacks from one damage. There's a defense too? That's the load too I assume.
[1207.32s -> 1215.18s]  Defeated. You got plus five experience. What about loot? Oh nothing. This is cool. I like you can
[1215.18s -> 1219.82s]  actually move them too. Am I gonna get overwhelmed eventually? All right cool.
[1222.73s -> 1230.18s]  You will encounter battle. You will encounter. Oh this is fucking contrast man. I got contrast
[1230.18s -> 1235.62s]  dye in my blood. You will encounter. Why can I not say encounter? You will encounter battles
[1235.62s -> 1240.98s]  while traveling as well in events. If you encounter an enemy too powerful you can try to escape.
[1242.02s -> 1250.74s]  Okay so there's a chest right here. Training room. Distance? Okay boat.
[1256.57s -> 1262.41s]  There's a supplies chest. There's a sign next to the chest that reads one free potion per adventure.
[1265.46s -> 1270.82s]  It says it's actually like on the desktop. That's cool. Double click my bag to view your items.
[1270.82s -> 1276.87s]  Click and drag to move items between bags. Bags have a limit to how much they can hold to only take
[1276.87s -> 1285.22s]  what you need. Is there, can I see that limit? Do I have to double, do I have to open this?
[1286.18s -> 1301.88s]  Just copy paste bag. Copy paste bag. Open bag. Copy potion. Paste potion. That's so funny.
[1301.96s -> 1307.32s]  Throw away bag. Is that supposed to be me? Music. Whoa hold on there's music.
[1308.76s -> 1324.18s]  All right that's really loud but let me hold on. Let me fix that. I don't like this one.
[1336.81s -> 1357.16s]  Oh oh oh I think we found it. Oh absolutely we did. Let's get out of the boat. Turn to surface yeah.
[1358.12s -> 1366.31s]  Jesus. Take potion. What do you mean don't take the potion? Hold on what's this mean?
[1366.31s -> 1370.63s]  Pause? What's the taskbar do? Oh I have music. All right how do I turn it down?
[1372.15s -> 1384.52s]  Taddis? Where's my, where's the control panel? There it is. That's better. It's a little too
[1385.16s -> 1388.60s]  harsh for me. This is the king's land. The king's, all right get out of here.
[1389.24s -> 1394.74s]  I don't like all these windows open. Actually yeah I do. We'll keep this one open.
[1395.38s -> 1401.16s]  This is the king's land. The king's castle is to the east, right? But be careful traveling to the
[1401.16s -> 1405.32s]  east too quickly. There are powerful monsters closer to the king's castle so take your time
[1405.32s -> 1415.06s]  to get some experience on the way. What about the potion? What? You got a quest. What? Double
[1415.06s -> 1423.54s]  click the quest icon to view and manage your quests. Orientation. New message. Adventure corp.

[14823.14s -> 14830.12s]  that's plus eight damage on my weapon i don't think that's plus eight damage to spell is it
[14831.16s -> 14839.43s]  i'm not sure that's how the way it works i think it's only on the on a melee damage protection is
[14839.43s -> 14846.79s]  good too but is five percent damage protection better than 12 defense and 15 block that's for a
[14846.87s -> 14857.38s]  fucking scientist that's not me disenchant i will i must get the last treasure

[14956.89s -> 14970.94s]  five percent protection versus having the shield i have 28 defense now that's not good

[15633.82s -> 15637.81s]  Roach it's being guarded by a creature
[15639.45s -> 15653.66s]  Hey, it's a mimic limp rune spear of vitality book of apocalypse
[15659.74s -> 15661.74s]  16 vitality that's a lot
[15662.22s -> 15666.12s]  That's a huge amount of vitality

[15715.66s -> 15732.86s]  40 intelligence 41 intelligence. It's a mimic. Don't drink them. You will die. I know if can I drink one more though?
[15733.74s -> 15739.74s]  Only have one mana potion. This is really terrible. Actually, this is really really bad. I'm gonna have to run away and fight
[15740.42s -> 15760.26s]  Attack normally
[15760.26s -> 15782.38s]  This is not a good idea. This is bad idea, but it's kind of working
[15783.62s -> 15788.62s]  This is what about a bad idea. This was why did I listen to this person attack normally? Why did I listen?
[15789.18s -> 15791.02s]  What did I listen?
[15791.02s -> 15807.22s]  I'm dead. I only took 90% of my HP fuck

[15868.25s -> 15871.48s]  Chug attacks. I can't I'm not chugging attack
[15872.64s -> 15880.11s]  Which way I go. I am regening though. Thankfully. I'm not getting any random battles. That's good
[15880.63s -> 15884.39s]  Whatever it's a down
[15887.44s -> 15904.46s]  Wow, that's what a great move. Look at that. Look at that. Look at that. I need to kill one more person
[15942.03s -> 15946.45s]  Don't miss blocks
[15946.65s -> 15949.61s]  I'm a mage. I'm not supposed to be doing this in the first place
[15950.77s -> 15989.03s]  Apocalypse 2 no, okay. All right. All right. All right. I'm at the heritage. Okay
[15991.30s -> 16021.17s]  I can disenchant and I just chance something fuck
[16021.77s -> 16059.10s]  Attack potion and then pray that I can kill it with three healing potion potion of attack
[16059.70s -> 16062.65s]  You're not but I have
[16063.17s -> 16069.87s]  Disenchant disenchant disenchant what there's nothing else. We didn't chant the royal the royal dick
[16069.89s -> 16071.89s]  Thing I already did it's bugged
[16072.13s -> 16078.14s]  In fact get this away from me the orb. It's been no, I have disenchanted everything
[16079.34s -> 16081.84s]  Yeah, it just it's bugged
[16083.06s -> 16098.18s]  There's an enormous heart like organ it beats so heavily you can feel the area around you change shape and the air rush back and forth
[16099.02s -> 16109.32s]  Destroying this will surely destroy the sky eater with great force you managed to pierce the flesh of the heart
[16109.80s -> 16113.47s]  There is no blood but instead of rush of fresh air
[16114.03s -> 16119.94s]  It's beating slows and a lump on the side opens to reveal an eye twice the size of your head
[16120.46s -> 16126.00s]  You try to communicate with the alien, but there is no response
[16126.88s -> 16144.86s]  only attack
[16146.54s -> 16150.22s]  Killed you I win I win I
[16150.78s -> 16168.98s]  Didn't get hit heart completely stops. There is a perfect stillness for a moment before the room around you begins to shrink
[16169.58s -> 16181.23s]  And the for the room around you begins to shrink and the air sucked out from every direction
[16181.71s -> 16188.60s]  You try to escape, but the passage quickly becomes too small. The air is gone. You lose consciousness

[16570.29s -> 16572.21s]  Saved the world
[16572.21s -> 16577.17s]  In one try and then died at the first encounter. That is very accurate
[16577.97s -> 16579.57s]  That's what happened
[16579.57s -> 16583.90s]  Can I like you want to bury them?
[16584.54s -> 16586.43s]  Yes
[16586.43s -> 16588.35s]  Who's a memento?
[16588.35s -> 16590.35s]  The club you couldn't use

[16603.87s -> 16609.44s]  Um, I think it's gonna have to be the northern northern mash
[16610.48s -> 16615.47s]  that turns around
[16617.52s -> 16621.79s]  Or the limp ring
[16621.79s -> 16624.19s]  Or um, I just I just get to keep his stuff
[16625.07s -> 16627.57s]  It goes to next of kin
[16627.98s -> 16631.34s]  I'm not gonna put the most powerful weapon in the world
[16631.90s -> 16633.82s]  into a coffin
[16633.82s -> 16637.20s]  It's mine now dad
[16637.84s -> 16650.14s]  But that's what you keep that. Oh, that's a good thing. I clicked it
[16668.30s -> 16678.72s]  Kylie kisser lunch lock. All right here take the best weapon in the game
[16679.60s -> 16682.32s]  Hey lunch lock take the best sword in the game
[16684.54s -> 16688.94s]  All right. I'm done. I'm not playing another one. I can say you can play this more than a few times though
[16689.82s -> 16694.35s]  Can you not use it?
[16694.35s -> 16697.68s]  In his inventory every level six
[16703.78s -> 16705.78s]  And the weapon is gone no, it's here
[16708.98s -> 16712.10s]  Here we go again with the end of the stream voice
[16713.06s -> 16716.64s]  Rhythm heaven tomorrow. Yes
[16717.74s -> 16719.74s]  Rhythm heaven is going to be tomorrow for the week
[16721.44s -> 16723.44s]  today was a
[16725.49s -> 16727.49s]  I was a little under the weather today
[16728.29s -> 16730.29s]  Because I had to go get an MRI done
[16732.85s -> 16733.97s]  So
[16733.97s -> 16735.97s]  Wasn't feeling a thousand percent today
[16736.45s -> 16739.60s]  But I did I wanted to stream and this was a requested game
[16740.56s -> 16749.04s]  So we'll leave it at that. Yes. I said yeah with contrast
[16751.68s -> 16753.68s]  uh, but I do have some
[16754.80s -> 16757.04s]  Uh potentially very interesting news for you
[16760.40s -> 16763.22s]  Joel has responded
[16763.46s -> 16767.15s]  And it looks like we're going to do keep talking and nobody explodes this weekend
[16768.11s -> 16772.14s]  I would assume we'll be doing that on
[16772.86s -> 16776.13s]  saturday
[16776.13s -> 16778.61s]  That would be nice make sense. Keep talking to nobody explode
[16782.19s -> 16784.19s]  another worst stream
[16792.34s -> 16799.10s]  Let's go worst stream 2020 no, I okay if the worst stream 2020
[16800.06s -> 16802.88s]  I mean, it's that's funny
[16802.96s -> 16804.00s]  That's funny
[16804.00s -> 16809.76s]  But I mean I and the mods go through all the nominations to see what's what and we you know take things out
[16809.76s -> 16811.76s]  Then maybe yeah that maybe that's the wrong category
[16812.88s -> 16818.48s]  Every every single worst stream of 2020 cannot be a stream that I streamed with Joel
[16819.44s -> 16824.42s]  That can't be every nominee. That is actually kind of funny though
[16827.41s -> 16830.37s]  So so i'm sorry, but that's not gonna happen
[16831.09s -> 16838.70s]  Community content night is also slated for saturday, but what i'm going to assume
[16839.82s -> 16841.38s]  is
[16841.38s -> 16843.38s]  when we played
[16843.38s -> 16845.84s]  last time
[16845.84s -> 16847.84s]  We only played for like an hour or two
[16849.63s -> 16852.99s]  Last uh, like a week or so ago when we did it. We only played for like an hour and a half
[16853.95s -> 16862.02s]  It's tomorrow. Well, technically saturday
[16864.13s -> 16866.82s]  Or maybe um
[16866.82s -> 16869.06s]  How long is rhythm heaven? How long is that game going to take to play?
[16870.02s -> 16872.02s]  Hold on. Let me look this up
[16872.26s -> 16879.04s]  How long is rhythm heaven it's long really
[16881.52s -> 16887.73s]  I always thought it was one of those games you could kind of
[16888.91s -> 16891.39s]  Holy shit. This is yeah, it's eight hours
[16892.09s -> 16896.43s]  16 hours for the extras and main game. Oh my jesus
[16898.26s -> 16905.44s]  Okay
[16905.44s -> 16908.48s]  Let me let me talk to him. Let me let me see what his what his schedule looks like
[16909.36s -> 16911.36s]  As if not saturday, then maybe we could do it
[16912.08s -> 16913.04s]  on
[16913.04s -> 16914.96s]  Sunday or monday or something
[16914.96s -> 16921.60s]  Don't cancel no, no, no, we're playing rhythm heaven tomorrow. I just didn't know it was that long
[16922.32s -> 16925.71s]  Probably two full streams to get through it
[16927.92s -> 16931.04s]  Let me let me see what his schedule looks like and we'll slate it for like
[16931.98s -> 16934.40s]  saturday sunday monday one of those days
[16935.12s -> 16938.11s]  streaming now
[16938.11s -> 16940.27s]  Maybe it'll be better to do that on like monday
[16941.23s -> 16949.25s]  I would say
[16949.25s -> 16954.21s]  Five minutes ago. He said he was playing it this weekend. Well that I I didn't realize that rhythm heaven was like a 10 hour game
[16954.29s -> 16956.29s]  I thought it was like four or three
[16956.93s -> 16962.72s]  I was under the assumption that rhythm heaven was less than three or four hours long
[16963.84s -> 16968.38s]  It's because it's very hard
[16968.98s -> 16970.98s]  Oh, i'm gonna love it then let's go
[16971.70s -> 16980.77s]  But tomorrow is going to be a very early stream
[16981.57s -> 16985.33s]  Not only is it rhythm heaven. It's starting at like 11 o'clock in the morning
[16991.26s -> 16992.22s]  so
[16992.22s -> 16996.75s]  There is that
[16996.75s -> 16998.86s]  But that's gonna be it
[16998.86s -> 17000.86s]  We do have
[17000.94s -> 17005.90s]  Um, I do want to briefly go over the bits from a few days ago
[17006.62s -> 17009.98s]  Because I was up really late and it was like a 13 and a half hour stream
[17010.86s -> 17012.54s]  so I do want to
[17012.54s -> 17013.90s]  at least
[17013.90s -> 17016.54s]  cover those
[17016.54s -> 17017.58s]  as
[17017.58s -> 17021.71s]  Much as I can
[17021.71s -> 17024.67s]  Based and like elicit. I don't even remember saying half of that shit
[17028.30s -> 17030.06s]  Gimli stream
[17030.06s -> 17032.14s]  No outro. Yeah. Yeah there there is
[17034.58s -> 17036.58s]  but i'm saying i'm gonna start with um
[17037.76s -> 17040.32s]  The bits and subs and everything or at least the bits that we missed
[17042.30s -> 17043.82s]  from a few years ago
[17043.82s -> 17050.61s]  It was about 13 hours worth
[17054.43s -> 17056.11s]  Get it open
[17056.11s -> 17058.11s]  But i'll see you guys tomorrow morning
[17058.19s -> 17062.51s]  bright and early pacific time in which 11 a.m. Is not really bright and early
[17063.63s -> 17064.67s]  but
[17064.67s -> 17066.67s]  It is earlier
[17071.62s -> 17073.62s]  You got a stream or so I can get my wink points
[17074.99s -> 17076.27s]  Yeah, I know
[17076.27s -> 17078.27s]  I do
[17078.27s -> 17080.27s]  Get some music playing
[17084.62s -> 17094.88s]  Irma wink grew pilled. All right, let's try to go through these in a timely manner
[17097.02s -> 17099.02s]  We had five dollars from an anonymous cheer
[17099.66s -> 17102.93s]  Just five dollars
[17102.93s -> 17108.13s]  It was a huge amount of community subs also. It's every stream. There's a bunch of community subs
[17108.69s -> 17110.69s]  At the beginning now because of the hype train
[17112.53s -> 17114.21s]  Thank you so much guys
[17114.21s -> 17116.21s]  You guys every fucking day
[17116.69s -> 17121.41s]  Dump huge amounts of money on this stream and now there's this incentive for a hype train
[17123.92s -> 17126.13s]  Thanks guys
[17126.13s -> 17132.13s]  We had 250 from ipod matt. I said germa. I can't do this anymore any more hype and i'm gonna spontaneously combust
[17132.77s -> 17136.93s]  And he says thanks dude, and he smashes his keyboard and it was him exploding
[17138.69s -> 17142.21s]  Hey cad, thanks for the 250 cad
[17142.77s -> 17144.93s]  Is this the hype train for the bathtub stream?
[17146.14s -> 17151.95s]  No, I ain't ever getting in a bath on stream. You know that horror story that happened in my made-up reality
[17154.83s -> 17156.83s]  near shoe, thanks for the thousand bits
[17157.57s -> 17159.97s]  Thank you near shoe potion dweller. Thanks for 250
[17161.86s -> 17165.86s]  I'm, so sick of these hype trains. They're genius because they're making you so much money though
[17166.10s -> 17168.10s]  Even though I can tell you don't want them
[17169.52s -> 17172.88s]  well, if it's not that I don't want something like that to happen, it's just
[17174.67s -> 17176.67s]  Uh, i'm gonna keep increasing
[17177.39s -> 17182.18s]  the difficulty
[17182.18s -> 17184.18s]  For them to happen in the first place
[17184.66s -> 17187.28s]  So it doesn't happen every single time
[17188.66s -> 17191.86s]  But I mean right so he hates money. No, but listen
[17192.58s -> 17194.08s]  there's
[17194.08s -> 17197.60s]  There's all right. There's a sub train every single stream
[17198.48s -> 17202.16s]  And it's like that's very very good for me. That's a lot of money
[17202.96s -> 17204.96s]  But I never I don't want to
[17205.36s -> 17208.08s]  Have people think that that's something that they have to do every day
[17212.69s -> 17216.93s]  So I I I increased it a little bit as of the last two days. So i'm gonna
[17217.57s -> 17221.33s]  Make it i'm gonna raise the challenge a little bit to make it so it doesn't happen
[17221.89s -> 17225.89s]  As often and it might take a little bit more time and might be more difficult to do
[17226.77s -> 17230.42s]  The rain pisses him off
[17230.58s -> 17235.38s]  Stream every day for a hype train every day
[17236.66s -> 17243.18s]  Taking a vitamin
[17243.18s -> 17245.74s]  I appreciate it though. Thank you near shoe. Thanks for the 400 bits

[17254.48s -> 17256.48s]  All those things are incredibly difficult
[17257.12s -> 17262.34s]  German do you know that germa doesn't know how to chat? Hey chat, you know, germa doesn't know how to drive a car
[17263.30s -> 17268.88s]  That's why he can't that's why he sucks at fixing them 18 percent of people change their own oil
[17271.84s -> 17273.84s]  That's just that's
[17273.84s -> 17278.88s]  Okay, germa wink wink. What do you mean? What do you mean the wink happened? Oh didn't

[17286.10s -> 17288.10s]  Tingey just redeemed a wink
[17288.58s -> 17293.82s]  How did you get 75 000 points in like two weeks? What?
[17320.64s -> 17326.32s]  This is history this is history
[17327.28s -> 17329.04s]  Yeah, that kind of is
[17329.04s -> 17349.94s]  But that's still on weird i'm gonna i'm gonna look a little blue and green and shit

[17369.71s -> 17378.94s]  That's the only one that's gonna happen. I don't like it. I'm not doing it again
[17381.84s -> 17385.74s]  That wasn't worth it
[17389.26s -> 17391.26s]  Of course, it's not worth it
[17392.50s -> 17394.10s]  Of course not
[17394.10s -> 17407.78s]  Now that one was
[17407.78s -> 17414.96s]  Anyways, uh all those things are hard sticks. Hey clap them back. Thank you for the 400 bits. They say my fucking
[17415.68s -> 17418.24s]  Bean, I don't know what that is my beans

[17462.29s -> 17463.65s]  Hey gnarly, thanks for the 250
[17463.65s -> 17464.93s]  I thought I loved the hype train ride
[17464.93s -> 17470.21s]  But on my third train I started noticing the wires coming out of the streamer and the voice modifier he had
[17470.85s -> 17478.45s]  Even the starting soon planets are actually just pre-recorded footage. Honestly sucked all of the hype out of it. Thank you feels bad, man

[17544.78s -> 17546.46s]  I remember your name in chat
[17546.46s -> 17552.06s]  You pog champed and said I can't believe he did it. I remember I did like you were in the chat

[17566.82s -> 17570.43s]  Lord of the Rings the two towers
[17570.43s -> 17572.03s]  Well, I like
[17572.03s -> 17575.66s]  I was gonna say I like money, but that's kind of fucked up
[17577.68s -> 17579.68s]  Thank you. I really appreciate

[17598.93s -> 17603.92s]  Breadsticks from pizza hut. No, he couldn't not that thing
[17606.85s -> 17615.30s]  Without it. He doesn't get that
[17615.30s -> 17618.02s]  No, but really though, that's that's 50 dollars. It's a lot of money. Thank you
[17618.74s -> 17621.42s]  Isn't pizza hut doing real bad, by the way?
[17621.90s -> 17626.69s]  I heard they were going under that true. I mean it was like one of
[17627.33s -> 17628.83s]  the
[17628.83s -> 17631.57s]  17 000 watch mojo videos. Is that for real?
[17643.74s -> 17646.54s]  They started charging an extra one dollar for their original crust
[17647.98s -> 17649.42s]  scumbags
[17649.42s -> 17650.94s]  How could they?
[17650.94s -> 17657.39s]  It's like when subway made the five dollar footlong and then made it the six dollar footlong and then made it the seven dollar footlong
[17658.83s -> 17664.03s]  And then they said oh shit, we'll do the five dollar footlong again, but it's only like four sandwiches
[17664.75s -> 17670.85s]  Got that from a watch mojo video. It's not even watch mojo
[17671.57s -> 17673.57s]  What's it? There's another one. It's called like
[17673.65s -> 17677.41s]  There's like three of them that make the same videos and they have the same person that talks
[17683.49s -> 17685.55s]  mojo watch
[17685.55s -> 17690.62s]  looper
[17690.62s -> 17692.69s]  Yeah, they
[17692.69s -> 17694.69s]  No, not much not matching mojo
[17697.07s -> 17699.07s]  All right side. I don't there's a lot
[17699.31s -> 17701.31s]  And they all have the same person talking
[17701.63s -> 17705.92s]  It's that same lady. It's that same girl
[17709.97s -> 17715.17s]  We make videos every single day. So click on that bell. It's the same person in every video
[17721.47s -> 17723.87s]  You're acting like we've watched these you had to have seen one
[17728.34s -> 17730.34s]  We make videos every single day
[17731.14s -> 17740.19s]  Are people still telling you to click on the bell?
[17741.23s -> 17743.73s]  in every video
[17743.73s -> 17745.73s]  You know, let me I I got I have to say this
[17748.05s -> 17751.73s]  How stupid do people think that the audience is?
[17753.09s -> 17755.09s]  That they have to be told
[17755.33s -> 17756.37s]  every
[17756.37s -> 17759.28s]  single day
[17759.28s -> 17761.78s]  To click on the bell
[17761.78s -> 17765.71s]  every single day
[17765.71s -> 17768.13s]  Remember click on that bell to get notifications
[17769.23s -> 17772.03s]  Oh, okay
[17772.03s -> 17777.23s]  For 364 days i'm going to tell you to do that because I don't trust that you're going to do it
[17781.78s -> 17786.10s]  Not like once a week felt like once every like other video no, no every single video
[17792.46s -> 17794.46s]  But it's because of the new people
[17798.24s -> 17803.65s]  Uh, do you know how many of those new people don't aren't even not even logged into youtube?
[17811.81s -> 17813.01s]  What bell?
[17813.01s -> 17816.77s]  Somebody just shared this video with me. I'm gonna make an account to click a bell
[17817.73s -> 17819.17s]  That's not gonna happen
[17819.17s -> 17835.44s]  Smash the like button. Yeah, but the the bell is youtube decided that they were gonna make people's videos not show up
[17835.44s -> 17841.92s]  So you have to click another subscription button to be able to get people's videos. Is that what that's it, right?
[17842.96s -> 17846.66s]  Hey, you subscribe to this person
[17846.74s -> 17850.69s]  You want to see their videos?
[17850.69s -> 17854.80s]  Be sure
[17854.80s -> 17856.80s]  What they should probably have done
[17857.28s -> 17861.12s]  Is shouldn't they just have like a pop-up come up that says? Oh, hey, by the way
[17861.60s -> 17863.68s]  Uh notice you haven't watched the last
[17864.94s -> 17866.94s]  475 watch mojo videos
[17867.44s -> 17870.72s]  Do you still want to say subscribe to them and that person could go?
[17871.86s -> 17873.86s]  Oh, fuck. Yeah
[17874.45s -> 17878.61s]  No, I guess not
[17878.61s -> 17880.58s]  Why does it have to?
[17880.58s -> 17883.14s]  Oh, by the way, this has been it's been three days. It's been three days
[17883.78s -> 17891.49s]  Oh, so, uh dear germa985. We've noticed that uh, you haven't in the last four days have not watched
[17892.45s -> 17894.61s]  Six years worth of videos from watch mojo
[17897.71s -> 17899.71s]  Oh, uh, okay
[17901.87s -> 17914.29s]  YouTube doesn't want to encourage you to cut down on potential watch time though. It's a lot to make that many videos, man
[17914.29s -> 17916.37s]  I can't I couldn't even think about it
[17918.43s -> 17922.75s]  After I make one I don't know. There's like a team of people but after I made a video back in the day
[17923.63s -> 17925.95s]  I was just I was done
[17925.95s -> 17929.79s]  I was done. I want to make one of these for like at least two days. I'm fucking tired
[17930.59s -> 17939.03s]  I clicked the bell on your youtube channel, but it must not be working because i'm not getting any notifications
[17941.01s -> 17943.01s]  Oh shit, the sub boxes are broken
[17947.36s -> 17949.36s]  Wait, hold on you you didn't get my last
[17950.08s -> 17953.68s]  Five videos in a row that were top 10 scariest abandoned buildings
[17954.64s -> 17972.93s]  Uh, well, i'm sorry to hear that you should have am I gonna play kenshi? No, I've closed the book on that
[17973.74s -> 17975.70s]  Okay
[17975.70s -> 17977.78s]  Last three videos were doctor's appointments
[17979.95s -> 17981.95s]  Yeah. All right. Let's keep going
[17982.27s -> 17990.19s]  Uh sell thanks for the ten dollars thousand bits from sell thousand bits from yoko thousand bits from lmm, man
[17990.99s -> 17992.99s]  All of you. Thank you
[17993.31s -> 17997.55s]  They say fueling the train. That's yoko. Uh nova saying fueling the train while i'm here though
[17997.87s -> 18003.23s]  What part of massachusetts are you from you say boston, but that's what everybody says from i'm from well, um
[18004.35s -> 18009.07s]  There's a reason why people on the internet don't give uh direct echo locations of where they live
[18014.90s -> 18015.62s]  so
[18015.62s -> 18018.58s]  Uh, this question is uh, when i'm not going to answer
[18019.22s -> 18032.69s]  But you don't live there. My family does my friend. You know what I mean? Like it's
[18033.57s -> 18037.73s]  Hey, you don't live there anymore. You can just like uh, what if yeah, no one will care
[18042.11s -> 18044.11s]  No, but actually what you don't understand is
[18044.67s -> 18046.67s]  You do what you have it, right?
[18046.67s -> 18049.01s]  It was boston
[18049.01s -> 18051.09s]  city of boston inside the city
[18052.21s -> 18054.21s]  I've rode the train everywhere
[18055.81s -> 18057.33s]  I ate hot dogs
[18057.33s -> 18064.24s]  What does that I don't know what that has to do with anything
[18074.61s -> 18076.61s]  Inside city limits confirmed
[18081.09s -> 18085.52s]  But I appreciate the ten dollars though. Aren't you from rural mass?
[18089.18s -> 18091.18s]  What do you mean rural mass
[18093.60s -> 18095.60s]  This is not it's not like
[18095.60s -> 18097.60s]  It's not like mississippi
[18106.69s -> 18111.81s]  Oh, I guess no, I guess that is right. I guess that is well, not you know what I mean like this
[18113.29s -> 18117.71s]  Population per square mile all the way in western mass is one to ten
[18119.41s -> 18122.48s]  What?
[18122.48s -> 18127.01s]  Wait a minute population per square mile one to ten
[18129.44s -> 18131.84s]  one person potentially per mile
[18135.62s -> 18140.61s]  That's ridiculous
[18140.61s -> 18146.38s]  Well squared mile squared mile squared mile
[18147.26s -> 18150.21s]  Dude, are you guys excited for the xfl?
[18151.01s -> 18153.01s]  I can't wait for the xfl
[18154.75s -> 18156.43s]  Like that's gonna be
[18156.43s -> 18159.31s]  I can't wait the xfl is coming back in a week
[18160.19s -> 18162.43s]  I didn't even know this was happening
[18162.43s -> 18167.26s]  This is the moment in the xfl where like there's no fair catch and people just run into each other and like
[18167.50s -> 18169.82s]  Roche it at each other didn't they get no it's back
[18177.38s -> 18179.38s]  Two forward passes are allowed
[18182.02s -> 18184.02s]  Yeah, and they have a they have a shootout
[18184.98s -> 18187.73s]  If there's overtime
[18187.73s -> 18190.29s]  Like soccer or you know football
[18191.63s -> 18194.02s]  It's gonna be like hockey
[18194.02s -> 18196.74s]  That's gonna be ridiculous. I I can't wait
[18201.17s -> 18203.73s]  I I really I don't care that much about sports that much
[18204.53s -> 18205.78s]  but
[18205.78s -> 18208.10s]  I feel like it could be entertaining to watch just
[18208.90s -> 18213.06s]  You only need one foot in bounds to make it catch. It's a college rule
[18215.87s -> 18217.71s]  What's wrong with me?
[18217.71s -> 18220.66s]  I'm talking about the the xfl
[18221.22s -> 18224.10s]  of the new football league from vince mcmahon that was
[18225.06s -> 18232.90s]  Lasted one season back in 2002. It was a disaster. That's coming back
[18238.48s -> 18242.00s]  There was like four injuries every single game in the xfl
[18243.92s -> 18248.24s]  I don't I think I gotta like read the rules, but is is this coming back?
[18249.04s -> 18255.36s]  Why aren't you from boston? I thought you liked baseball. I do but I mean I don't watch
[18256.16s -> 18259.44s]  Every single game or anything if i'll catch it if it's on
[18261.47s -> 18263.47s]  I do like baseball. I do very much
[18263.71s -> 18271.94s]  It's like the football game you played that was half mortal combat what's the league one of the greatest
[18272.74s -> 18275.62s]  Video games ever speaking of great speaking of sports
[18277.01s -> 18281.33s]  I didn't even tell you guys this but over here. I have a very special game
[18282.29s -> 18284.66s]  I got nba street over here
[18286.40s -> 18288.40s]  I'm gonna play the absolute hell out of this
[18288.48s -> 18295.78s]  I've got quite the collection over here of video games
[18296.96s -> 18298.96s]  They're just waiting to be played
[18305.54s -> 18307.46s]  Both beautiful joes
[18307.46s -> 18310.40s]  Not a big deal. Don't worry
[18310.48s -> 18316.99s]  What's that? Oh begaman legends one and two over there hanging up
[18323.07s -> 18325.07s]  They're just sitting over there ready. They want to be played
[18325.63s -> 18332.93s]  You'll see them soon
[18332.93s -> 18335.55s]  tony hawks underground
[18335.71s -> 18337.71s]  And tony hawks underground too
[18339.01s -> 18340.45s]  I went nuts
[18340.45s -> 18351.50s]  And some other stuff, you know underground is the best
[18352.14s -> 18354.77s]  When are you gonna do the diablo 2 hardcore?
[18356.10s -> 18358.10s]  When I get a little less busy
[18359.73s -> 18361.65s]  It's gonna start to get
[18361.65s -> 18363.65s]  Really really busy for me
[18365.34s -> 18367.34s]  i'm trying to not
[18367.56s -> 18369.66s]  overthink this and overthink anything here, but
[18370.72s -> 18372.72s]  Over the next three or four weeks
[18373.12s -> 18374.72s]  I'm going to be very busy
[18374.72s -> 18381.28s]  I wanted to make sure I had a bunch of stuff ready to go lined up
[18381.92s -> 18387.62s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, there's no
[18388.26s -> 18392.35s]  There's no there's no baby
[18393.07s -> 18395.25s]  Let's just quell that one immediately
[18401.34s -> 18403.58s]  Do you have any special videos that you mentioned were in the process?
[18404.46s -> 18406.46s]  Uh, they've turned into streams
[18407.26s -> 18409.26s]  And yes, there is at least one
[18410.48s -> 18413.04s]  Very very very major project that is
[18413.92s -> 18415.52s]  Getting off the ground now
[18415.52s -> 18422.30s]  It's gonna be crazy
[18424.51s -> 18426.51s]  It is not the rumble 2
[18426.99s -> 18430.43s]  Although there are plans to try to do that
[18433.24s -> 18435.02s]  Hopefully
[18435.02s -> 18437.26s]  if not in 2020 then
[18437.82s -> 18439.82s]  very early into 2021
[18445.87s -> 18447.87s]  Then that stream
[18448.43s -> 18451.70s]  is going to be

[18476.53s -> 18478.53s]  Firing them. No, i'm done
[18479.01s -> 18481.01s]  What's the reverse of firing somebody?

[18827.52s -> 18829.52s]  But if you mean business
[18830.24s -> 18831.68s]  Call my manager

[18910.16s -> 18912.16s]  kai sob cryo
[18913.12s -> 18917.20s]  Thank you sob for the thousand bits as a kid me and my brother used to play this game an insane amount
[18917.92s -> 18919.92s]  But for some reason in our copy
[18920.00s -> 18922.00s]  Of the game it was impossible to save
[18922.48s -> 18925.68s]  So what we did is just play as far as we could every time without dying
[18926.24s -> 18928.24s]  Because then we'd have to start from the very beginning
[18928.96s -> 18934.88s]  This made the nazgul among other things so scary and that one time I got all the way to
[18936.00s -> 18938.32s]  Moira it was so fucking fog
[18939.60s -> 18942.00s]  That I had my brother come home from school to watch
[18942.96s -> 18944.96s]  Anyways, thanks for the insane nostalgia
[18945.92s -> 18951.82s]  The game is so hard. It's just so hard and so chunky and
[18952.62s -> 18954.62s]  But it still kind of holds up
[18959.12s -> 18964.08s]  Shanji again a ten thousand bits. I think we went over it but a fucking hundred dollars
[18964.64s -> 18967.68s]  They said I was going to ask if you realize you've invaded into playing a game
[18967.68s -> 18969.36s]  That's basically just a short joke
[18969.36s -> 18973.92s]  But then you confused candy for fruit and asked if dropping an ipad in the tub could kill you
[18974.08s -> 18976.88s]  So yeah, here's to my favorite century gun. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[18977.60s -> 18979.50s]  Thank you
[18979.50s -> 18987.70s]  Thank you

[18997.54s -> 19004.00s]  I love okay, you can tell when

[19012.00s -> 19014.64s]  You get comments like this and I actually don't even remember this
[19015.52s -> 19021.28s]  But I think i'm the meme machine gave 5 000 bits so they gave 50 dollars
[19022.08s -> 19024.00s]  Which is huge
[19024.00s -> 19028.32s]  And they said for the love of all that is holy germa. You finished the first level of the game
[19028.96s -> 19035.60s]  I'm literally paying you 25 times the wager of the bet for you to go play with joel instead of dragging this out. Holy shit
[19037.95s -> 19039.55s]  that was
[19039.55s -> 19043.28s]  just about
[19043.28s -> 19044.88s]  seven hours
[19044.88s -> 19046.88s]  Before the stream actually turned off
[19050.51s -> 19052.67s]  I think the stream went on for another eight hours after that
[19053.31s -> 19064.90s]  Flushy 400 bits play with joel. We would both enjoy that more
[19065.94s -> 19067.94s]  And well, that'll happen soon. Don't worry

[19109.12s -> 19115.52s]  I laughed so hard as we realized you will never escape the compact streamer meme and fate conspires against you
[19116.61s -> 19118.61s]  Yeah, and today
[19118.61s -> 19122.45s]  Yes, and today I had a little bit of a meltdown about

[19128.93s -> 19134.21s]  I I saw I I went off a little bit. I've got a little irritated. That's what happens
[19135.17s -> 19144.00s]  That's what happens when people throw darts at you. He's smalting
[19148.62s -> 19157.22s]  There was a little issue it was a little issue find me a clip of it being of more than a little issue
[19158.18s -> 19160.54s]  It was just a small issue
[19160.54s -> 19165.90s]  I told one person to fuck off right? That's what happened. I pretty I said hey, fuck you or something. What happened?
[19168.96s -> 19174.48s]  There were 5000 people here today. I one person I said hey get out of here. Why what did I do? Did I do that?
[19182.83s -> 19185.23s]  I didn't ban anybody. I don't I don't
[19187.23s -> 19190.06s]  I don't ban anybody

[19220.22s -> 19222.22s]  Chowder man. Thanks for the thousand bits chowder man
[19222.30s -> 19225.10s]  Hey, I remember you mentioned you were thinking of playing outer wilds the other night
[19225.10s -> 19227.82s]  And if you're still considering it, I highly recommend it. I am and I will
[19228.62s -> 19235.18s]  For the most part the next let's see

[19258.83s -> 19263.09s]  um, I have
[19263.09s -> 19264.99s]  planned out
[19264.99s -> 19266.19s]  the next
[19266.19s -> 19267.87s]  at least
[19267.87s -> 19269.79s]  30 to 40 streams
[19269.79s -> 19271.79s]  Of the things that I know what i'm going to do
[19273.33s -> 19276.93s]  I'd say I'd say I have about 30 streams worth of stuff just ready
[19277.89s -> 19282.53s]  So I don't have to go. Oh, what should I do now? What should I do today? I planned out a lot of stuff
[19286.03s -> 19287.63s]  Bugleberry is hot
[19287.63s -> 19291.18s]  That's my opinion. That's your opinion. You can have that's fine. You can have any opinion you want
[19291.74s -> 19297.25s]  Whatever you think whatever the I mean he's handsome, right?
[19297.81s -> 19303.31s]  No one said that. Yes, I did look it up in the logs swiggity swanky. Thanks for the 250
[19303.31s -> 19304.11s]  This game takes me back
[19304.11s -> 19309.07s]  There was a game boy advanced game of both the two towers and return of the king which played as a diablo clone
[19309.79s -> 19311.79s]  Good times diablo 2 hardcore
[19312.19s -> 19314.19s]  Uh until I die
[19314.51s -> 19316.37s]  Is a stream as well
[19316.37s -> 19318.37s]  I'll be playing that should be fun
[19320.06s -> 19324.38s]  Chad is going to here's the thing about that. That's what you need to make it a little more interesting
[19324.86s -> 19326.86s]  Chad is going to pick the class
[19326.86s -> 19328.86s]  And pick every single skill point
[19329.58s -> 19330.54s]  so
[19330.54s -> 19340.93s]  Make it a little more interesting. I give it 10 minutes
[19344.93s -> 19348.21s]  Are you doing that because you do not want to win i'm doing it so I can prove
[19348.77s -> 19350.77s]  That no matter what anybody throws at me
[19351.57s -> 19353.57s]  Diablo 2 is my
[19353.81s -> 19355.81s]  Favorite video game top five ever
[19356.13s -> 19357.41s]  I can deal with anything you throw at me
[19357.41s -> 19360.13s]  I you don't think I know the synergies for every single fucking item in that game
[19360.69s -> 19363.65s]  You don't think I know every single item every single skill
[19364.93s -> 19367.87s]  Oh, let's let's make him a sorceress
[19368.35s -> 19370.83s]  And put 20 points into warmth. I can deal with that
[19371.55s -> 19373.71s]  In fact, I hope you do that reverse psychology do it
[19374.35s -> 19375.63s]  See what happens
[19375.63s -> 19380.82s]  Oh shit, he actually knows the skills
[19386.59s -> 19387.79s]  Hey cad
[19387.79s -> 19389.47s]  Chad you're here. I saw you

[19406.74s -> 19408.74s]  Yeah, that's funny
[19408.82s -> 19411.30s]  That's funny
[19411.30s -> 19414.74s]  All the shit. All right, if you look up who's watching a movie right now
[19415.38s -> 19417.38s]  If you watch it like a load of things
[19425.89s -> 19428.37s]  That stream was funny the stream was a lot of fun
[19429.17s -> 19439.28s]  But thank you cat. Thank you orange julian for the five and a bit cheers to your gamer snack. It was delicious. Thank you
[19439.92s -> 19442.80s]  Jerma's pet ferret. I don't have a pet ferret, but thank you for the five dollars
[19443.60s -> 19447.74s]  Appreciate it. They say hey jerma. I'm samey
[19448.30s -> 19453.34s]  Or saime. I suffer from swelling and pain in both of my hands. It makes it almost impossible to use them some days
[19454.14s -> 19456.94s]  I'm a writer artist and a gamer and I work with dogs
[19458.14s -> 19460.74s]  Pretty awesome
[19460.74s -> 19464.86s]  I used to work with dogs too. I volunteered at an animal shelter. It's awesome
[19464.94s -> 19467.18s]  I highly recommend it if anybody has not done it before
[19467.90s -> 19471.31s]  I've seen countless doctors still no definite answer. I'm very proactive and sitting
[19471.87s -> 19477.15s]  Around doing nothing is hard on my mental health hate feeling useless and helpless, but your streams vods and videos
[19477.63s -> 19480.99s]  Sincerely help keep me sane and positive. You're a light in the dark times
[19481.55s -> 19487.12s]  Thank you
[19487.12s -> 19489.12s]  Thank you for the 500 bits first of all
[19491.79s -> 19496.21s]  and second of all
[19496.21s -> 19498.29s]  just know that
[19498.29s -> 19499.73s]  most people
[19499.73s -> 19502.53s]  Are going through something
[19502.53s -> 19509.02s]  There are I think a lot of people forget that I think a lot of people don't remember that and don't realize that you know
[19511.01s -> 19513.01s]  and if you can collectively
[19513.66s -> 19517.26s]  You know, that's why I like to tell people about but jerma. Why do you tell people about this?
[19517.50s -> 19520.70s]  Oh, why why'd you tell me about like all the things happening in your life that aren't very good?
[19521.58s -> 19525.36s]  It's because I I want to be a real person
[19525.84s -> 19533.10s]  You guys know I want you to know that there there there are bad things that happen in everybody's lives essentially
[19535.49s -> 19539.81s]  There are good things and there are bad things and I think that talking about the bad things
[19541.74s -> 19556.69s]  Let's us all know that we're human. So that's one of the reasons why sometimes I do share
[19558.05s -> 19562.77s]  Things that aren't really going great for medical problems like you have yourself as well
[19563.65s -> 19571.36s]  I wish you the best
[19571.36s -> 19573.36s]  I wish you the absolute best
[19576.26s -> 19578.26s]  Thanks for watching. Thanks for being here
[19578.50s -> 19581.04s]  And keep going
[19581.04s -> 19594.04s]  As best as you can moving on from that we had five dollars from mishanji
[19594.98s -> 19597.14s]  recipe for jerma jerky smoothie when
[19598.10s -> 19601.46s]  Uh, it's called open a bag of crave beef jerky
[19602.34s -> 19607.62s]  the best
[19607.62s -> 19615.79s]  Without a question without any single question at all. The only problem with crave beef jerky is it is incredibly expensive
[19616.83s -> 19620.46s]  But it is it is the best
[19621.34s -> 19623.34s]  It's the best
[19623.58s -> 19628.54s]  I have had lots of beef jerky before i've never had one that was better than crave
[19630.69s -> 19632.69s]  It's just very expensive
[19632.85s -> 19638.80s]  It's like eight bucks. Yes
[19639.36s -> 19644.80s]  It is like 750 or eight bucks for one of those bags of beef jerky. It's only like one or two and a half
[19644.88s -> 19646.88s]  It's like I can eat the whole thing in one bag
[19647.92s -> 19653.94s]  And that's the problem when you go get it
[19655.30s -> 19656.50s]  Oh
[19656.50s -> 19660.10s]  Crave beef jerky. All right. I love this stuff
[19660.66s -> 19663.22s]  You know how many i'm gonna grab like four of them. Yeah
[19663.22s -> 19666.42s]  I want to I want to make sure I have some in case i'm hungry and get one of those snacks
[19667.38s -> 19674.14s]  Then you go to the checkout and you realize that you just bought like 40 fucking dollars of your grocery bill is beef jerky
[19675.18s -> 19679.46s]  And you're like what what why why is my grocery bill so high?
[19681.81s -> 19684.13s]  40 but 50 dollars, but that
[19684.69s -> 19687.81s]  All right, because like well, I got like five or six like crazy
[19688.45s -> 19691.65s]  That's a huge amount of money for my grocery bill. Okay
[19694.75s -> 19696.51s]  fine dining
[19696.51s -> 19704.27s]  Like I said one thing if it was expensive and not the best
[19705.46s -> 19707.95s]  But it's expensive
[19708.03s -> 19709.39s]  and the best
[19709.39s -> 19713.68s]  One of my favorites is is uh chili lime
[19714.72s -> 19715.60s]  Oh
[19715.60s -> 19722.54s]  Doesn't get better than that. There's a sweet chipotle. Mm. It's okay. It's not as good as the chili lime though. Seriously
[19727.44s -> 19730.80s]  Jeremy's part of the one percent one percent jerky
[19732.77s -> 19735.17s]  Jack links original well, hold on jack links
[19736.51s -> 19737.89s]  Original

[19752.53s -> 19754.62s]  uh
[19754.62s -> 19756.62s]  Jack links if you want a classic standard
[19757.34s -> 19762.00s]  classic standard
[19762.00s -> 19764.80s]  Try crave if you like super niche flavors
[19768.61s -> 19776.45s]  Black cherry barbecue pork jerky lemon garlic turkey jerky garlic chili pepper beef jerky. Ooh, that sounds pretty good to me
[19777.33s -> 19779.57s]  It's because it's weird. No, it's not. It's great
[19780.85s -> 19786.22s]  Hold on. What's the best and worst beef jerky ranked? What's the worst?
[19787.02s -> 19790.30s]  Three jerks jerky filet mignon beef jerky apparently is the worst
[19791.34s -> 19793.86s]  Jerky ever
[19793.86s -> 19796.26s]  And then chefs cut real steak jerky
[19797.06s -> 19800.32s]  apparently second worst
[19800.62s -> 19803.28s]  Oberto original beef jerky is like
[19805.34s -> 19807.34s]  Jack links coming in at number three
[19808.29s -> 19811.65s]  Jack links original beef jerky number three. Oh fuck off
[19812.45s -> 19815.57s]  Crave original sea salt at number two. What's number one?
[19816.53s -> 19821.49s]  Oh, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, whoa, wait a minute. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. This is the worst. This is the worst
[19821.49s -> 19823.97s]  This is top worst. This is number two worst
[19824.53s -> 19828.05s]  What's the worst beef jerky? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
[19829.17s -> 19830.77s]  This is the worst
[19830.77s -> 19835.31s]  What's wrong with what do they say about it?
[19844.59s -> 19849.63s]  Yes craves jerky is made with an impressive list of all-natural minimally processed ingredients
[19850.27s -> 19855.95s]  But this tiny one ounce serving has 10 grams of sugar in it a third of every gram of jerky is sugar
[19856.35s -> 19860.43s]  For comparison a fifth of each gram of glazed crispy cream donut is sugar
[19863.22s -> 19864.82s]  Who gives a shit?
[19864.82s -> 19874.18s]  Although this is now the best. All right, let's hold on
[19875.22s -> 19877.94s]  This is i'm actually getting mad right now. What's number one?
[19879.04s -> 19881.04s]  brooklyn bill tong

[19907.42s -> 19914.77s]  Oh, it's a donut. It's not the donut. Yeah, and when you eat white bread your body treats it like cotton candy
[19915.33s -> 19917.17s]  Whoop the fucking doom
[19917.17s -> 19920.00s]  We really have to debate that

[20112.22s -> 20116.93s]  What is this?
[20116.93s -> 20119.73s]  I want to listen to this. I don't even know what this is. This is not even the same stream
[20121.86s -> 20128.26s]  Yes, god, you guys are mean. Does he tell you guys it mean because like wait, this isn't this is not in my stream
[20128.82s -> 20134.45s]  This is tomato stream streamers. I try to avoid it
[20135.73s -> 20139.41s]  Yes, god, you guys are mean. Does he tell you guys it mean because like
[20139.97s -> 20144.85s]  It seems like everyone's in on some joke about bullying him for his height. That's pretty toxic. What the fuck
[20145.81s -> 20147.25s]  Hey
[20147.25s -> 20153.79s]  You guys bully me for my color blindness, I guess which isn't actually even color blindness. It's gaslighting. So I guess

[20161.84s -> 20163.84s]  He hasn't been that short. Oh
[20163.92s -> 20165.92s]  He's been moderately tall
[20166.32s -> 20170.64s]  At average not at best. He was just he was he was like
[20171.76s -> 20178.26s]  He wasn't short to me didn't seem that short. Then again, he was on like he was wearing like very high heel shoes
[20186.06s -> 20188.06s]  At the time that I met him
[20198.91s -> 20201.62s]  Tomatoes a great guy. He is he actually
[20208.18s -> 20210.18s]  Show actually bad
[20210.58s -> 20213.38s]  Talking about talking about the wind being taken out of your sails
[20214.34s -> 20220.88s]  From what's like having a direct line to hundreds of nine-year-olds every night
[20229.54s -> 20231.54s]  Stop
[20232.82s -> 20236.02s]  I need to finish the bits we gotta get out of here
[20242.24s -> 20246.56s]  No, what what set it off completely tonight was somebody came in and said
[20248.56s -> 20250.62s]  What was it? It was like
[20250.62s -> 20255.10s]  Like lol i'm 15 and taller than jeremy and it's like dude
[20255.90s -> 20258.86s]  You hide his in your dna. I I didn't like

[20264.46s -> 20267.42s]  Lettuce you just that's just how tall you are
[20270.80s -> 20272.00s]  I didn't
[20272.00s -> 20276.80s]  I didn't like eat sand for breakfast and lunch and dinner every day. I just happened to not be
[20277.84s -> 20279.84s]  That's like our dna, man
[20281.63s -> 20283.63s]  It's like not so surprising
[20287.90s -> 20292.85s]  Oh, man boxbox coming in with a braid boxbox said you would feed us
[20293.81s -> 20297.33s]  Boxbox says you would be boxbox said you would feed us
[20301.20s -> 20308.56s]  What do you want to eat boxbox coming boxbox? We're at the end of the stream hanging out. Well, thanks for the raid. Welcome everybody
[20309.52s -> 20312.34s]  What do you guys want corn?
[20312.34s -> 20314.86s]  Got lots of sand
[20314.86s -> 20316.86s]  I got sand i've got corn i've got lettuce
[20317.34s -> 20319.90s]  Apparently the only three things that i've ever eaten in my life
[20320.62s -> 20322.78s]  To make me smaller than a 15 year old
[20325.55s -> 20329.71s]  If only he had eaten his vitamins and had broccoli maybe he would
[20330.43s -> 20332.67s]  You know what i'm not even going to get into it anymore
[20333.90s -> 20335.90s]  No, i've said my piece
[20337.86s -> 20342.82s]  Sand isn't food, but hey welcome 1700 people almost 2 000 people in a raid. Thank you boxbox
[20343.54s -> 20345.22s]  Welcome everybody
[20345.22s -> 20347.22s]  We were we were currently debating
[20347.70s -> 20350.64s]  um how tall I was
[20351.34s -> 20352.86s]  and how
[20352.86s -> 20357.02s]  people are comedians
[20357.02s -> 20360.06s]  It's interesting that there's thousands of comedians here
[20362.00s -> 20365.92s]  And they must all be part of the same comedy group because they all say the same jokes
[20366.72s -> 20370.40s]  They're all together in the I guess in the same same room, I guess
[20371.20s -> 20374.59s]  It's not much of a debate
[20378.37s -> 20382.05s]  We're all funny act. There it is. There it is. There it is. There it is. There it is. There it is

[20406.82s -> 20410.29s]  As we wind down for the end of tonight's stream
[20411.09s -> 20417.42s]  But yeah, uh, we're currently going over the bits
[20418.38s -> 20419.82s]  I do the
[20419.82s -> 20424.38s]  I don't read subs or bits or any donations on stream. We do it at the end of the post stream
[20424.46s -> 20426.30s]  Which is what we're doing now
[20426.30s -> 20429.58s]  and we have a very very very long stream a few days ago that I
[20431.02s -> 20433.46s]  Um almost collapsed
[20433.94s -> 20438.18s]  And I couldn't stand anymore as I had to leave and it was a 13 and a half hour stream and I was like
[20438.26s -> 20440.26s]  I gotta get out of here. So we're doing them now
[20440.74s -> 20442.50s]  I could have just said that
[20442.50s -> 20444.50s]  Much easier in about one sentence
[20444.82s -> 20452.26s]  All right, like that was much easier just to say hey i'm doing the bits from three days ago. Okay
[20453.39s -> 20457.31s]  All right, uh half monty. Thanks for the five dollars and ten cents. Great job jerma
[20457.31s -> 20460.03s]  I knew you had it in you super entertaining in a painful kind of way. Yeah

[20492.08s -> 20494.16s]  But I still believe you can beat this game little buddy

[20504.98s -> 20507.06s]  Saren fp. Thanks for the 500 bits yo jerma
[20507.06s -> 20510.18s]  I can't believe i've stuck around for almost 11 hours and loved every bit of it
[20510.18s -> 20512.18s]  There was still over two and a half hours after that
[20512.34s -> 20516.11s]  I'll probably be asleep by the time you read this but I just wanted to let you know not to
[20516.75s -> 20521.02s]  Not to something
[20521.02s -> 20523.34s]  a turbo driver dev gave
[20524.36s -> 20525.58s]  5,000
[20525.58s -> 20526.86s]  bits
[20526.86s -> 20531.22s]  Turbo driver dev. Thank you
[20531.22s -> 20535.39s]  I wake up in europe and you're still streaming. You're truly insane
[20536.43s -> 20538.43s]  Thank you turbo driver for the huge amount of money
[20539.23s -> 20543.42s]  Sometimes that happens. It only happens when I play playstation 2 or dreamcast games
[20545.02s -> 20545.82s]  and
[20545.82s -> 20548.38s]  That's actually kind of bad
[20548.86s -> 20551.57s]  because a shitload of things I have back here are
[20552.53s -> 20554.77s]  playstation 2
[20555.23s -> 20557.23s]  games old games, so
[20558.27s -> 20560.27s]  I don't know if it's about the old games thing
[20560.99s -> 20563.74s]  But I got a lot of them behind me
[20563.90s -> 20567.17s]  So be careful
[20567.17s -> 20572.99s]  Be careful nile aureon says for 300 bits. Hey, you fucking died mate. He he xd
[20573.63s -> 20574.91s]  Thank you
[20574.91s -> 20578.91s]  Judge mortis a thousand bits jerma, please for the love of god turn it off and go to bed your mother
[20578.91s -> 20581.95s]  And I can hear your damn tears through the wall go to sleep

[20601.02s -> 20606.70s]  Jerma, I went to bed for six or seven hours had a dream you accidentally put porn on the stream during a break
[20607.02s -> 20609.74s]  Woke up sweating for some reason and then saw you were still streaming
[20610.38s -> 20615.10s]  I don't know what's with the sex dreams people have of me putting sex on my stream
[20616.06s -> 20625.74s]  There has to be some reason why this is happening more than if okay if more than one person is having
[20626.84s -> 20628.84s]  subconscious dreams
[20629.18s -> 20631.18s]  Of me having sex on stream
[20631.98s -> 20633.98s]  Or doing porn on stream
[20635.02s -> 20637.02s]  What kind of vibe am I giving off?
[20639.25s -> 20641.57s]  That has to what kind of vibe am I giving off?
[20653.95s -> 20656.27s]  It's because people fall asleep in front of your streams and then
[20658.77s -> 20660.61s]  All right, let's get to the end here
[20660.61s -> 20663.81s]  Uh bug bear and frog. Thanks for the 500 bits. They say congrats

[20669.01s -> 20671.09s]  Nope
[20671.09s -> 20676.13s]  And then finally from a few nights ago. We had fifty dollars five thousand bits from swivel
[20677.17s -> 20679.17s]  Thanks for the 5k bits
[20680.13s -> 20685.25s]  Thanks for the longest stream jerma. Love you, man. What's the software that you edit your voice with?
[20691.52s -> 20693.60s]  software

[20699.23s -> 20702.32s]  I just got it
[20702.32s -> 20704.80s]  It's pretty fun. You can do all kinds of cool stuff with it
[20707.04s -> 20709.04s]  You can do all kind of kylo ren

[20741.07s -> 20745.65s]  Uh, we define those droids find where he is
[20746.21s -> 20748.21s]  And then get that

[20891.70s -> 20896.58s]  Is let's do an experiment. Let's do an experiment if I title the stream bugleberry reads bits
[20897.38s -> 20899.38s]  Willed a thousand people leave
[20899.70s -> 20908.02s]  Do you think so? I actually don't want to do that experiment

[21082.01s -> 21085.15s]  Castellion for the 300 bits. They say please watch
[21086.03s -> 21089.57s]  Are we supposed to be short? I saw this already
[21091.01s -> 21093.57s]  It was oh, oh very funny

[21097.90s -> 21102.22s]  Croak, thanks for the 500 bits. I've had a long history of word surgery due to my needlessly broken bladder
[21102.78s -> 21104.78s]  Which just recently started to heal
[21104.86s -> 21108.46s]  Hope whatever it is you're going through finds an end soon and you find relief soon enough me too
[21110.26s -> 21112.26s]  it's starting to be just
[21112.42s -> 21114.58s]  something that I always constantly have to think about
[21116.26s -> 21118.06s]  and
[21118.06s -> 21120.86s]  It's it's just annoying right it nobody wants to ever have
[21121.82s -> 21125.90s]  A medical issue or a problem that you don't know. What is the actual problem?
[21126.94s -> 21130.30s]  But I have i'm going down the road of knowing what it is
[21131.10s -> 21137.92s]  And trying to obviously I have to figure out what kind of treatment or solution I want to do
[21137.92s -> 21139.92s]  Do I want to have surgery on my hernia?
[21140.16s -> 21142.16s]  Do I want to just get that out of the way and just do it?
[21142.56s -> 21147.92s]  Because I have one and it might be contributing to some of these problems. Do I want to get an injection in my rib cage?
[21149.12s -> 21151.12s]  To do a nerve
[21151.12s -> 21155.04s]  Stop some of the nerve problems right from the whatever the inflammation in my rib cage
[21155.44s -> 21157.12s]  Do I want to do those things?
[21157.12s -> 21159.36s]  And when am I going to do those things? How am I going to do those things?
[21160.32s -> 21165.25s]  Uh, what am I gonna just schedule out like now do it now?
[21166.37s -> 21172.03s]  I don't know because I was told that the hernia that I have
[21173.14s -> 21175.14s]  Is not really big enough
[21175.54s -> 21178.66s]  to need to do surgery on it yet
[21179.62s -> 21181.90s]  it's kind of at the
[21181.90s -> 21184.06s]  Wait and see because it's not that it's not huge
[21184.62s -> 21192.40s]  It's compact. Yes
[21192.40s -> 21193.68s]  it is
[21193.68s -> 21198.53s]  What do you mean yet? Um hernias at the hernias can get worse
[21199.49s -> 21204.48s]  This could be something that's been developing in my stomach and esophagus for years
[21205.44s -> 21208.88s]  And it could just get worse. You throwing up softball jokes, you know
[21212.51s -> 21215.47s]  You set it up. We knock it's please explain this in the trump voice
[21223.17s -> 21226.93s]  Oh, we are all here in this beautiful. Wait, that's not correct
[21227.65s -> 21232.26s]  Uh, let me excuse me
[21232.50s -> 21236.36s]  Let me tell you something first about first about why is it so low?
[21241.49s -> 21243.49s]  All right
[21245.98s -> 21249.17s]  Excuse me
[21249.17s -> 21251.17s]  Let me oh god

[21256.02s -> 21258.58s]  It's not it. It's it's not a big deal
[21259.22s -> 21261.22s]  I just have a small hernia
[21261.62s -> 21267.62s]  If the hernia is big enough to be a problem, but it's not really a problem. It's it's it's a little large
[21268.18s -> 21269.54s]  It's not really
[21269.54s -> 21274.07s]  It's it always goes back to bugleberry
[21277.73s -> 21279.73s]  So we had 200
[21280.53s -> 21282.51s]  200 hernias

[21482.86s -> 21484.86s]  hurting yourself or
[21484.86s -> 21488.70s]  Self-harm or any of those kind of thoughts you don't want to be having those thoughts in the first place
[21489.50s -> 21496.53s]  I would get in touch with somebody that's a professional that can help you
[21497.94s -> 21499.94s]  Because you never want to let that linger

[21508.30s -> 21510.30s]  Helps you and keeps you from acting on anything
[21513.47s -> 21515.31s]  You got to be careful there
[21515.31s -> 21522.54s]  Please please please
[21523.65s -> 21525.65s]  Go at it from a few different avenues
[21526.05s -> 21537.84s]  If I can elevate your mood a little bit
[21539.14s -> 21541.14s]  That makes me really really happy
[21546.43s -> 21548.43s]  just make sure that you're
[21548.83s -> 21550.83s]  Taking the steps necessary to try to
[21551.55s -> 21552.91s]  Get better
[21552.91s -> 21558.54s]  And sometimes it takes more than one front to do that
[21559.42s -> 21565.97s]  I wish you the best of luck. Thank you so much for the 700 bits
[21567.01s -> 21582.78s]  And thanks for hanging out. Keep on keeping on no shame and getting help
[21583.90s -> 21588.54s]  That's true
[21588.54s -> 21590.30s]  Honestly, we should we should
[21590.30s -> 21592.30s]  We should think about
[21592.38s -> 21594.70s]  mental health the same way we think about
[21595.90s -> 21599.76s]  If you got hurt, you know, if you like you're handed physical
[21600.72s -> 21605.74s]  You know what i'm saying?
[21605.74s -> 21612.85s]  Medical we should not be thinking about mental health as oh, no, no, no, no, that's that's like that's completely different
[21612.85s -> 21616.21s]  It's different. No, that's way different. It's I don't know. No, no, we don't talk about that
[21617.92s -> 21620.48s]  Because it's your it's your body everybody. It's everybody has a
[21622.00s -> 21626.03s]  It's your brain. It's your body. We got to treat it the same way
[21626.99s -> 21629.62s]  It has to be taken as seriously
[21637.52s -> 21639.52s]  Everyone has a brain. Yeah, no, that's true
[21644.42s -> 21646.42s]  It's different but it's just as important
[21646.82s -> 21648.58s]  Yeah, it is
[21648.58s -> 21652.29s]  but if you go to
[21653.09s -> 21654.66s]  uh
[21654.66s -> 21656.50s]  colon doctor
[21656.50s -> 21659.38s]  and you go to a
[21660.34s -> 21661.94s]  bone doctor
[21661.94s -> 21663.78s]  Those are completely different
[21663.78s -> 21666.24s]  They're completely they're treated completely differently
[21667.76s -> 21671.28s]  The tests that are completely different the way that you treat it is completely different, but it's still
[21672.99s -> 21684.93s]  Still medicine it's still treatment and for for some there's this
[21687.22s -> 21689.14s]  There's this stigma
[21689.14s -> 21695.78s]  That I really hope that we get over when it comes to how we see mental health and how we view mental health
[21698.42s -> 21700.02s]  It really shouldn't be there
[21700.02s -> 21701.94s]  It just should not be there
[21701.94s -> 21707.86s]  We need to treat
[21707.86s -> 21709.86s]  The issues that come up
[21709.86s -> 21712.00s]  in our bodies
[21712.00s -> 21714.72s]  And that's really the end of it all that's really what it should be
[21715.68s -> 21722.21s]  That's kind of how I feel about that
[21722.45s -> 21726.93s]  The bone doctor will heal
[21727.65s -> 21730.58s]  Almost said the rest of that
[21730.58s -> 21732.58s]  Almost said the rest of that
[21737.02s -> 21741.50s]  But anyways one day we will all be robots and all we have to worry about is rust
[21750.38s -> 21752.46s]  S. J. Thanks for the 250 hey germo
[21753.18s -> 21756.13s]  I've been a fan for a long time and want to share a dream that I had
[21756.93s -> 21758.45s]  Here we go
[21758.45s -> 21761.65s]  Where you were hosting a tour across the u.s with chat on your bus

[22807.06s -> 22809.06s]  mayonnaise and chicken sandwich
[22809.62s -> 22818.53s]  Yeah, I think so. I think so somebody said gross
[22819.49s -> 22826.69s]  Don't make me angry
[22826.69s -> 22831.41s]  You would love me when i'm angry because the jump king string is one of the top streams i've ever done
[22832.37s -> 22835.30s]  So go ahead get angry
[22835.30s -> 22841.36s]  I had the highest retention rate per viewer on that stream
[22842.08s -> 22844.08s]  Than anything i've ever done before
[22847.58s -> 22850.64s]  Also made that one up too. Hey, mr. Dask
[22851.58s -> 22853.42s]  Thanks for the thousand bits
[22853.42s -> 22857.65s]  Is this enough to cover the guild charter?
[22858.45s -> 22861.76s]  I thought I already paid for it
[22861.76s -> 22866.88s]  But you kept asking again and again to cough it up or else I couldn't sell my strongest potions around here
[22867.44s -> 22872.96s]  Hope this isn't because of my refusal to sell them to you. My strongest potions would kill a dragon let alone a man
[22874.26s -> 22876.26s]  Well, that's i'm sorry to hear that
[22877.06s -> 22879.78s]  Uh, I did not i have nothing to do with this. Thanks for the thousand bits
[22880.82s -> 22885.14s]  Peaceful hailey. Thanks for the 250 peaceful hailey. Hey jeremy. Hope you auto and kimmer well
[22885.54s -> 22888.10s]  Hope auto surgery went well in your mri. I'm sure it did
[22888.98s -> 22890.98s]  I usually have more to say but I got nothing
[22891.06s -> 22893.06s]  Just hope you have there's no music
[22893.22s -> 22895.22s]  Just hope you have a good night
[22896.85s -> 22903.06s]  Thank you. Peaceful hailey. I know what the video is
[22905.87s -> 22907.39s]  if you have
[22907.39s -> 22911.22s]  a youtube account
[22911.22s -> 22913.66s]  That was created
[22913.66s -> 22915.66s]  over the last 10 years
[22916.06s -> 22918.06s]  You've seen the video
[22918.14s -> 22924.03s]  Does that video have?
[22924.03s -> 22926.35s]  How many views does that video have like 600 billion?
[22927.31s -> 22934.99s]  Six million. Oh
[22935.71s -> 22941.86s]  That was wrong. Okay. All right. We're almost done here. We have uh niece
[22941.86s -> 22942.98s]  Thanks for the 500 bits
[22942.98s -> 22948.66s]  I want you to use my money to take kim on a romantic date to mcdonald's and only order from the dollar menu
[22949.70s -> 22956.66s]  Yeah, do you want to go to mcdonald's?
[22956.66s -> 22967.02s]  Like actually right when this is over you want to go mcdonald's? It's five. That's five bucks
[22967.58s -> 22972.80s]  You know, you can't you can't scoff at five bucks man five. It's five bucks
[22974.82s -> 22978.90s]  I love mcdonald's
[22978.90s -> 22980.90s]  I i'd love I do
[22981.06s -> 22993.47s]  I would rather eat at mcdonald's than most places because they got the big mac and nobody else has the big mac
[22994.19s -> 22997.15s]  The big mac is the best. It's just I love that thing
[22997.95s -> 23001.78s]  I get the same order every time I go to mcdonald's
[23002.48s -> 23004.48s]  And you're gonna think i'm disgusting
[23004.88s -> 23006.40s]  but if i'm hungry
[23006.40s -> 23008.08s]  I want to just
[23008.08s -> 23010.96s]  eat, you know what i'm saying e a t
[23011.92s -> 23015.02s]  Go to mcdonald's and we gotta change the screen
[23015.34s -> 23016.38s]  Yeah, this is
[23016.38s -> 23020.46s]  Go to mcdonald's to get a number one
[23020.46s -> 23024.38s]  And I don't really drink that much. I try not to drink a whole lot of soda. I get a bottle of water
[23025.34s -> 23028.90s]  I get a bottle of water number one with a good big fry
[23033.95s -> 23035.81s]  That's one
[23035.81s -> 23037.78s]  I then
[23037.78s -> 23040.72s]  get
[23040.72s -> 23045.38s]  I'm i'm this i'm naked right now. This is me being naked. I get uh two mcchickens
[23046.16s -> 23050.06s]  For me those are mine
[23051.92s -> 23055.15s]  and then
[23055.15s -> 23057.44s]  10 piece nugget
[23057.44s -> 23059.44s]  That I share with somebody
[23067.06s -> 23069.06s]  He this is a troll that is not a troll
[23074.26s -> 23076.26s]  So I eat probably like four or five
[23077.06s -> 23078.90s]  chicken mcnuggets
[23078.90s -> 23081.14s]  I eat the full big mac. I eat the mcchicken
[23086.66s -> 23092.48s]  And I eat the second mcchicken
[23092.48s -> 23094.48s]  Now that order does not happen every time
[23096.02s -> 23097.70s]  Delete the big mac
[23097.70s -> 23099.70s]  And I typically will do two mcchickens
[23100.02s -> 23104.13s]  And the 10 piece
[23104.13s -> 23106.13s]  Yes, it does. No, it doesn't
[23106.29s -> 23108.93s]  I got I got a I got a backtrack barry this one. I think
[23109.73s -> 23119.15s]  The 10 piece is a waste of money the 20 piece is 50 cents more
[23122.78s -> 23124.78s]  He eats this every day
[23125.50s -> 23128.90s]  That would be so awful
[23128.98s -> 23132.48s]  All right, let's keep going but mcdonald's is great. I mean, I like wendy's
[23133.36s -> 23137.74s]  I mean, I don't know if this means anything but the last time I had burger king I got a cold
[23138.06s -> 23139.58s]  Does that mean anything?
[23139.58s -> 23142.54s]  I don't know. I like burger king, but the last time I ate it. I got a cold
[23143.18s -> 23148.74s]  That's just true. That's that's I don't maybe it could be not even correlated but it happened
[23169.02s -> 23171.02s]  That's what the star chart said
[23174.29s -> 23179.06s]  No, I haven't eaten burger king. All right
[23180.91s -> 23182.91s]  Burger king sucks
[23182.99s -> 23187.87s]  It like I let's be honest be honest with us and yourself burger king sucks
[23189.22s -> 23191.84s]  but
[23191.84s -> 23194.43s]  Sometimes you just want it
[23194.43s -> 23196.27s]  the long chicken
[23196.27s -> 23203.06s]  The original chicken sandwich is I crave that sometimes. I'm just like, you know, I want long chicken. That sounds good
[23203.70s -> 23208.64s]  But it's just gross. It just is
[23209.89s -> 23211.65s]  And I think they know that too
[23211.65s -> 23215.74s]  But i'm not sure they care very much
[23215.74s -> 23218.38s]  Because they're still one of the big three they still do
[23220.54s -> 23222.54s]  McDonald's is kind of like that too
[23226.46s -> 23228.62s]  Long chicken. Yeah, you'll get a long chicken
[23230.03s -> 23236.03s]  It's okay burger king has this thing called the original chicken sandwich
[23237.81s -> 23239.81s]  If you order a chicken sandwich from burger king
[23240.53s -> 23242.67s]  You are ordering
[23242.67s -> 23247.79s]  A regular. Oh, yeah, it's a patty. It's our crispy chicken sandwich. It's not the long chicken
[23250.51s -> 23253.31s]  They they don't want you to order the long chicken anymore, even though it's better
[23254.03s -> 23256.11s]  They want you to order the tender crisp
[23256.75s -> 23260.83s]  Patty with bacon and ranch sauce. No, you get the long chicken. It's the only one that's good
[23268.08s -> 23271.10s]  burger king
[23271.10s -> 23272.38s]  Long chicken
[23272.38s -> 23277.73s]  There it is. Thank you
[23277.73s -> 23279.17s]  The long chicken
[23279.17s -> 23282.40s]  It's this thing
[23282.40s -> 23292.22s]  I always feel like if I look up a fast food burger and I save the image to my desktop i'm gonna get a virus
[23292.62s -> 23296.22s]  Don't you think that's the easiest fucking way to inject like a trojan in somebody's computer?
[23298.45s -> 23299.57s]  seriously
[23299.57s -> 23306.18s]  I feel like that's so simple
[23306.18s -> 23314.56s]  Like I hope that's not happening
[23314.56s -> 23323.28s]  This thing that's the bk long chicken. It's the only thing on the menu worth ordering anymore
[23333.02s -> 23337.10s]  Speaking of viruses. Make sure you update your windows 10. Why is there something in the wild right now?
[23343.31s -> 23346.35s]  You've never seen that. Yeah, because they they don't want you to order it
[23346.91s -> 23353.20s]  But they like hide it on the menu or something. It's like oh no, we don't want you to get there. We want you to get the
[23353.76s -> 23355.04s]  tender crisp
[23355.04s -> 23370.53s]  Well, we want the chicken zinger burger. What the fuck is this? This is a real what is it? What even is this sandwich?
[23373.33s -> 23375.57s]  Chicken royale. All right, let's finish the bits up
[23376.29s -> 23379.39s]  I'll be left tomorrow morning
[23379.39s -> 23382.26s]  with some wee
[23382.26s -> 23384.34s]  Just some normal guy. Thanks for the
[23386.00s -> 23391.90s]  2,000-bit donations 20 bucks. Love you jerma. Hopefully you do a you'll do return of the king
[23392.30s -> 23395.34s]  I will also i'm sending more bits because I forgot to put a message in the other one
[23396.66s -> 23399.06s]  Yes, you will see return of the king on this stream guaranteed
[23399.94s -> 23405.46s]  Hey gnarly. Thanks for 250 a few weeks ago. You argued with chad about oil changes and why they're a waste of time to do yourself
[23406.26s -> 23408.90s]  Well yesterday, I was reading my micro economics book
[23410.05s -> 23413.33s]  And it talked about how while it is cheaper to do an oil change yourself
[23413.97s -> 23417.81s]  It is more beneficial to pay someone else to do it because of comparative advantage
[23418.53s -> 23425.09s]  Instead of charging your oil or instead of changing your oil for 15 minutes spend that time perfecting your comedy
[23425.49s -> 23428.61s]  Because it makes you happier and wealthier. You're my iq. He was right all along
[23429.94s -> 23430.98s]  I know
[23430.98s -> 23438.21s]  I know. Thanks for the reassurance. Appreciate it ab joe. Thanks for the
[23439.31s -> 23442.69s]  5,000 bits a lot of $50 drops over the last few days
[23444.26s -> 23445.38s]  Thanks guys
[23445.38s -> 23449.81s]  Hello germbo. Good to see you again. Glad your mri went. Okay
[23450.37s -> 23452.69s]  So when are you going to rename the channel points to bald coin?
[23453.17s -> 23455.17s]  I thought that one was a no-brainer
[23455.41s -> 23461.82s]  Much love from one human to another human keep it up. I will thanks for the huge amount of money
[23464.58s -> 23467.46s]  Uh buccas bald because crypto was like a thing
[23468.59s -> 23470.91s]  You know, it still is by the way, it still is
[23471.63s -> 23478.29s]  But that was the big ride up to 20k and it was kind of a thing. It was it was
[23479.17s -> 23482.05s]  Bald coins a little outdated. It is a little dated
[23486.35s -> 23487.07s]  blueberry juice
[23487.07s -> 23489.79s]  Thanks for the 250. Hey germa couldn't catch the lord of the ring stream last week
[23489.79s -> 23491.79s]  So i'm super glad I could catch this one
[23491.87s -> 23493.31s]  It's a lot of fun
[23493.31s -> 23494.59s]  but
[23494.59s -> 23497.15s]  You can bet your sweet compact gnome ass
[23497.79s -> 23501.07s]  That i'm not gonna miss the rhythm heaven fever stream tomorrow
[23501.87s -> 23504.99s]  That game is one of my favorites and I guarantee you will have a great time with it
[23505.63s -> 23511.15s]  By the way, do you know the best method of getting pog stains pog stains out of the carpet?
[23511.71s -> 23515.42s]  Sorry, the wink made me pog a little more than I was
[23516.88s -> 23520.59s]  Oh, yeah, thank you. Um
[23521.23s -> 23522.43s]  Throw it away
[23522.43s -> 23528.78s]  Hey cad. Thanks for the 250 cad b tv. Look here chump. I'm an old diablo 2 pro
[23528.78s -> 23531.02s]  You couldn't last half as long as I couldn't hardcore
[23531.82s -> 23534.54s]  Uh, i'm probably gonna lag in the first 10 minutes
[23535.26s -> 23537.26s]  And die by a stray arrow
[23537.90s -> 23540.40s]  So that's just what happens in that game
[23542.91s -> 23545.79s]  Let's get the credits on the screen. I haven't seen these in a while
[23547.57s -> 23554.51s]  And they are fast stream is still hovering over 10 000 subs still
[23558.67s -> 23560.61s]  almost a full
[23560.61s -> 23564.61s]  More than two weeks later. There's still more than 10 000 people subbed to the channel
[23565.25s -> 23569.89s]  Which is crazy
[23569.89s -> 23578.50s]  Thanks for sticking around. Thanks for subbing much love to all of you
[23583.90s -> 23589.42s]  And then let's finish up the bits. We had hill synth for the 500 bits. They say I miss travis germa pluto. We'll go back
[23591.09s -> 23594.93s]  We'll do we're gonna do all of them. I'm gonna do two. I'm gonna do travis strikes again
[23595.49s -> 23596.77s]  I'm gonna do three
[23596.77s -> 23602.00s]  So don't worry. We're gonna we'll do them. There's a lot to do. I'm just busy
[23603.14s -> 23605.94s]  Trying to do as much as I can the time that I have
[23610.27s -> 23616.59s]  Hey memey. Thanks memey for the 400 bits. Thank you to quarter dime for the 200 bits. He got it wrong again
[23617.15s -> 23619.47s]  It's 250 Jeremy, but you gotta read it now
[23620.11s -> 23627.39s]  They say the problem with mental health is that people are often mentally unwell to treat their mental illness
[23627.39s -> 23630.83s]  It's like if the solution to a broken leg was to travel to the hospital on foot
[23635.07s -> 23638.50s]  I think the
[23638.50s -> 23640.53s]  the issue is
[23640.53s -> 23641.73s]  trying to
[23641.73s -> 23643.73s]  Get there before it gets there
[23643.73s -> 23645.89s]  It's hard to do
[23645.89s -> 23659.47s]  Travis strikes again is interesting for referencing soot as other work, but it's probably the worst no more heroes game
[23659.55s -> 23661.55s]  But not terrible, but still yeah
[23662.19s -> 23667.46s]  But what I mean is okay, like you said if you have a broken leg and you want to walk to the hospital on foot
[23670.32s -> 23672.24s]  Yeah, you would never do that
[23672.24s -> 23675.15s]  But it's harder to
[23675.15s -> 23678.21s]  It's harder to to not get to that state
[23679.17s -> 23684.64s]  With mental illness because it's not something that anybody can see
[23685.60s -> 23692.24s]  Right. It's not something that anybody can true. Oh that person. Well, that person has a broken leg. Everybody knows that they can see that
[23692.88s -> 23696.88s]  so it's harder to
[23696.88s -> 23703.10s]  To do and it can stay
[23704.06s -> 23707.01s]  You mentioned broken legs
[23707.17s -> 23709.73s]  The broken leg is a broken leg and it has to be treated immediately
[23710.51s -> 23713.42s]  immediately
[23713.42s -> 23714.86s]  something like
[23714.86s -> 23716.86s]  depression or mental health problems
[23717.58s -> 23722.62s]  They can stay dormant for a long time and they can slowly build up and over time
[23723.34s -> 23725.34s]  Years get worse and worse
[23725.42s -> 23730.13s]  And it's trying to find that spot
[23731.42s -> 23735.10s]  Where you haven't like you say in quotes like have the broken leg
[23738.32s -> 23745.10s]  Over time. It's tricky though
[23745.50s -> 23751.84s]  It is very tricky
[23751.84s -> 23754.16s]  We had these those 20 community subs
[23754.96s -> 23756.96s]  from supper eyes
[23757.28s -> 23759.28s]  Thank you supper eyes
[23759.36s -> 23761.41s]  A lot of subs. Thank you
[23761.41s -> 23765.38s]  How do you guys pronounce co-op juke like that?
[23767.42s -> 23769.26s]  Hey, jillette. Thanks jillette for the 250
[23769.26s -> 23773.82s]  I've been struggling a lot with addiction and depression and watching your streams and vods helped me a lot for these times
[23774.54s -> 23777.26s]  I was having a pretty rough day until I watched today. Thank you for everything
[23781.50s -> 23783.66s]  Yeah, it's the same stuff. We were talking about before
[23787.90s -> 23793.33s]  same boat
[23793.33s -> 23795.33s]  addiction depression anxiety
[23797.23s -> 23799.23s]  And same boat but different paddles
[23799.63s -> 23802.21s]  You know what I mean? It's they're they're all in the same
[23802.77s -> 23806.03s]  realm
[23806.03s -> 23807.63s]  And how to treat them?
[23807.71s -> 23811.63s]  There's a lot of different ways that people would say is better or worse
[23812.59s -> 23820.82s]  but hopefully
[23820.82s -> 23822.96s]  You know over time
[23822.96s -> 23825.23s]  You can figure it out
[23825.23s -> 23827.23s]  the necessary help and the necessary
[23828.11s -> 23830.11s]  The support group right because everybody needs it
[23830.67s -> 23839.50s]  I'm going to be stealing that analogy. Well
[23839.98s -> 23842.08s]  It's free
[23842.08s -> 23844.90s]  It's free you can have it
[23846.96s -> 23849.34s]  Thank you, jillette
[23849.34s -> 23851.34s]  I wish you luck with
[23851.66s -> 23856.21s]  Your addiction and your depression
[23856.21s -> 23858.21s]  Not something to be taken lightly, of course
[23859.94s -> 23867.09s]  Thank you. Good luck. Just some normal guy gave 400 bits
[23867.65s -> 23872.93s]  Hey germa the whole talk about mental health made me want to say this with bits to anyone who has any mental problems or know
[23873.01s -> 23874.53s]  someone who does
[23874.53s -> 23876.50s]  I had a friend long ago
[23876.50s -> 23880.90s]  Who did commit suicide and it killed me inside that he didn't talk to me before he did it or said anything
[23881.54s -> 23885.70s]  Just know that if you are suffering with mental problems, there's always someone there. You can talk to who loves you
[23886.50s -> 23899.17s]  I'm really sorry to hear that the best thing that you really can do if you really think that you have
[23901.71s -> 23906.51s]  These kind of terrible thoughts that you do, you know, you do you think to yourself I shouldn't be having these this is
[23907.55s -> 23909.55s]  This this is not good. This is not good
[23910.11s -> 23919.84s]  You got to reach out to somebody and hopefully that person is somebody that's equipped to help you
[23927.74s -> 23930.46s]  Call the hotline of need be call the hotline therapy
[23933.86s -> 23935.94s]  And try just day to day to
[23936.82s -> 23939.81s]  I mean, it's it's really easy for me to sit here and go well
[23939.97s -> 23942.93s]  Just try to make yourself feel better, you know with small things little things
[23945.95s -> 23947.95s]  While you try to get the help that you need
[23948.03s -> 23954.94s]  Try to find things that make you happy
[23956.03s -> 23957.95s]  Not things that make you unhappy
[23957.95s -> 23961.02s]  I've talked about it a few times for me
[23962.42s -> 23964.58s]  Whenever I feel bad and I felt
[23965.38s -> 23967.68s]  I felt pretty bad
[23967.76s -> 23969.41s]  over the last
[23969.41s -> 23971.57s]  Couple decades, you know, it's everybody can get
[23972.45s -> 23974.45s]  Some type of uh, you know feeling down
[23975.31s -> 23978.91s]  And not feeling like things are going well, and I think i've made even videos on this
[23981.92s -> 23986.80s]  I got happiness and I sought happiness by making other people happy
[23990.05s -> 23992.05s]  That's I wanted to make somebody
[23992.69s -> 23997.97s]  I want to make somebody else life easier. I want to make somebody else laugh. I want I wanted to watch somebody
[23999.17s -> 24001.09s]  Be excited about something
[24001.09s -> 24004.61s]  That made me feel good showing somebody something caring about something making
[24005.73s -> 24007.09s]  making somebody
[24007.09s -> 24010.77s]  part of a conversation and you what do you think about that and see what they say and
[24011.57s -> 24016.05s]  That's how I always tried to get myself out of potential ruts that I was in was trying to make other people happy
[24016.85s -> 24019.25s]  Because in my mind it's like if I couldn't make myself happy
[24019.89s -> 24022.21s]  I could make other people happy
[24022.21s -> 24025.49s]  And in return that helped me that made me happy
[24026.53s -> 24028.53s]  in sort of a rebound way
[24028.53s -> 24031.92s]  same thing with animals, too, I
[24032.48s -> 24034.48s]  Like I said previously I worked
[24035.04s -> 24037.12s]  I volunteered at an animal shelter and it was just
[24038.21s -> 24041.17s]  It made me feel good. It just made it made me feel good
[24043.90s -> 24047.50s]  because helping other people or helping other things it actually
[24048.77s -> 24050.77s]  It doesn't it doesn't at least it doesn't for me
[24055.70s -> 24058.50s]  like what when somebody says something
[24059.06s -> 24065.17s]  like when I when i'm done streaming and I look back and look at some of the things people saying in the comments and
[24065.97s -> 24068.45s]  The reddit threads and some of the memes and shit that people say
[24070.64s -> 24075.20s]  If people say how oh this was that was fun. That was really fun stuff
[24075.76s -> 24080.78s]  I had a great fucking time. That was a great stream. I'm just like, all right, that's fucking exactly
[24080.94s -> 24082.94s]  That's exactly what i'm looking for
[24085.26s -> 24087.74s]  You have to kind of find your own ways to fight
[24088.46s -> 24091.65s]  Your own ways to battle it
[24091.65s -> 24099.98s]  Everybody's different. Do I read the 4chan threads on you?
[24101.97s -> 24103.09s]  No
[24103.09s -> 24105.09s]  No, I don't really read that
[24105.33s -> 24114.83s]  Not really. I hope I hope people I hope they I hope they like me and if they don't then that's all right
[24116.42s -> 24117.70s]  You know saying
[24117.70s -> 24124.34s]  I have nothing against anybody that if that's somebody if they do or do not like the things I do
[24125.38s -> 24129.09s]  That's all right. Well, i'm not gonna i'm not gonna be like how fucking dare you
[24129.97s -> 24132.82s]  Why don't you like me? Well, how could you like it?
[24134.02s -> 24136.90s]  People have their own shit. They have their own things. I think are interesting
[24140.45s -> 24142.45s]  I've read those threads. No, they like you
[24144.98s -> 24147.14s]  Yeah, but it's not everybody though
[24147.22s -> 24153.70s]  And like you can't I know that I can't make everybody think that these streams are fun and interesting and I know for a fact
[24154.58s -> 24171.34s]  It's getting windy. You guys hear that
[24172.06s -> 24173.82s]  that was like
[24173.82s -> 24177.46s]  That was big
[24177.46s -> 24180.10s]  Um, no, but to finish that thought up
[24182.78s -> 24187.18s]  And wherever you probably hanging out on message boards or whatever websites you're on
[24192.18s -> 24194.90s]  Thanks for even watching it all even if you don't like it
[24196.53s -> 24199.73s]  And if you do then thanks again, because obviously you're still here
[24204.13s -> 24206.13s]  We have gone over a couple times
[24206.29s -> 24209.41s]  About the whole like oh like fuck the haters
[24209.97s -> 24212.13s]  Fuck if you fucking got fuck the haters
[24213.54s -> 24217.54s]  I don't care. I don't like I if you don't if you don't like me then
[24218.98s -> 24221.58s]  That's fine
[24221.58s -> 24223.58s]  I find I find that the visa is
[24223.90s -> 24240.42s]  Sort of abrasive with that kind of mentality when you're gonna go on oprah
[24241.89s -> 24243.89s]  Can I get on oprah? Will they get me on oprah?
[24245.38s -> 24248.10s]  That sounds like a roundabout way saying fuck the haters
[24256.03s -> 24258.11s]  No, I re seriously seriously
[24262.13s -> 24266.16s]  Go on konan
[24266.16s -> 24271.04s]  I've seen some threads in reddit. I've seen some stuff on 4chan. I've seen it when um,
[24271.92s -> 24274.32s]  somebody linked me when the
[24274.32s -> 24279.04s]  German rumbles were going on the live ones at one point somebody linked me a thread and people were having fun
[24279.20s -> 24281.20s]  And that's that's that's all I care about
[24281.44s -> 24295.33s]  Go on konan so we can compare heights
[24300.61s -> 24303.41s]  All right. Let's finish this up snoozing copter 250 from snoozing copter
[24304.77s -> 24306.93s]  Hey, it's really late here. Or should I say early?
[24307.65s -> 24312.77s]  It's 8 a.m. Now and i've been up the whole night yesterday. I woke up at 8 30 p.m. Yes, I know
[24313.57s -> 24318.13s]  It's been like this for three months now after the jet lag coming back to germany. I've been there before
[24319.33s -> 24321.33s]  I have been there before
[24323.17s -> 24325.17s]  It can it can fuck with you
[24326.67s -> 24331.07s]  I'm finally working on reversing it, but it's really demotivating waking up when the day is already over
[24331.87s -> 24334.99s]  Can you say in your cheers to you voice to go to bed with applause in the back?
[24336.51s -> 24364.43s]  We want to thank you for staying up with the stream
[24367.18s -> 24369.18s]  But it's time to go to bed now
[24369.82s -> 24373.47s]  Put your head down
[24374.13s -> 24376.13s]  Listen to this music
[24377.30s -> 24379.30s]  Get ready
[24379.84s -> 24381.84s]  Because here it comes
[24383.50s -> 24385.82s]  We want to thank you for being asleep
[24389.44s -> 24397.90s]  There you go. You know, i've made comments about what the best video on youtube is
[24398.54s -> 24400.30s]  And i'm not sure that one counts
[24400.30s -> 24402.94s]  But that's the that's one of the best pieces of media
[24403.74s -> 24407.26s]  That's ever been produced. It is that's the one that's the best piece of media
[24409.66s -> 24411.66s]  It's the the hog calling. No
[24411.74s -> 24415.82s]  Now cheers to you is the single greatest achievement. I think of all of humanity
[24419.33s -> 24421.49s]  When you look sleep up in the dictionary
[24422.53s -> 24425.09s]  There's your picture
[24425.17s -> 24426.53s]  It's there
[24426.53s -> 24435.49s]  How many views does that video have? It's it's probably like 32 000 or something, right?
[24438.08s -> 24440.08s]  93 000 views. Yeah
[24441.18s -> 24443.66s]  And how many of those views are have been us?
[24446.35s -> 24450.59s]  Because part two has 14 000 views part one has 100
[24452.35s -> 24457.50s]  I know for a fact i've watched this video at least 30 times at least
