[0.95s -> 11.28s]  It's been one minute. It's been one solitary minute. Sorry. I had to pee. My mic seems really fucking loud
[11.70s -> 30.11s]  Hold on. It's a loud mic. Why is it so loud? It's probably better. How's that? That's a good thing. It's good like that
[30.11s -> 39.20s]  It's good. I don't like being loud. It's scary. Peek the mic. I have a compressor on but no
[39.20s -> 48.00s]  I'm not peeking any mics. Not right now. We want to hear your beautiful voice. All right. I'm not supposed to be here
[48.00s -> 66.46s]  I'll be back. Just enjoy the intro. Okay. Well that tweet was not supposed to say that I
[68.36s -> 73.72s]  Started writing. I wrote mall making stream and then I put some words in front of it instead
[74.24s -> 80.44s]  That was gonna be like chilling making a mall, but now it just says chilling in my mall making stream
[80.44s -> 83.90s]  Well, I guess that's accurate
[83.90s -> 92.38s]  It's like two distinct thoughts. It's accurate though. The first response is what?
[92.86s -> 97.03s]  I'm chilling in my mall making stream. That's easy to understand
[97.63s -> 98.99s]  That's fine
[98.99s -> 102.90s]  Anyways, hello. How you guys doing? Hope you had a good week and
[103.98s -> 107.94s]  We are back for the next few days
[107.94s -> 111.42s]  Next few days is gonna be a lot of grab bag stuff
[111.86s -> 119.92s]  There's the week after this one. We've got Halloween. Whole week of scary shit
[120.52s -> 132.56s]  Both VR and non VR. We're also gonna be going back to House Flipper for a night
[132.92s -> 142.77s]  That's not scary, but I got to play it because the VR mode is coming out at the end of this week
[145.54s -> 147.54s]  Finally gonna play saw 2
[147.62s -> 154.66s]  Yeah, you will finally see saw 2 on this channel
[155.26s -> 161.16s]  Next week. We got three or four VR scary games to play
[161.68s -> 174.36s]  Some of them are probably dogshit, but whatever we have some non VR games to play as well and chubby bunny. Yes
[175.00s -> 181.32s]  Chubby bunny is next week too. Why is that such a big announcement for everybody? You know what I mean?
[181.32s -> 185.94s]  Why is that such a big deal? Oh, we've also next week. We've got a big stream chubby bunny
[186.46s -> 199.30s]  Not that it's really not that cool. It's gonna be stupid. You're not even gonna think it's funny. It's so cool
[199.74s -> 202.07s]  It's the best dude
[202.07s -> 203.75s]  Well, I will tell you
[203.75s -> 211.35s]  I'm probably the only streamer on twitch that will have a chubby bunny segment of their stream. So
[211.91s -> 214.07s]  Gotta get those accolades right where I can get them
[214.55s -> 224.90s]  Wrong. No one has done chubby bunny on twitch. I'm almost certain of that who has done chubby bunny on twitch that oh, wow
[224.90s -> 236.43s]  Yeah, I'm no one has done chubby bunny on twitch. I don't believe you. No one has don't do it though
[236.43s -> 240.39s]  Oh now I know why nobody's done it. Now. I know why nobody wants to do it. This is dangerous
[240.83s -> 247.78s]  I'm gonna be very I'm gonna have like a doctor in my room. No, no, no, no, no, no Jeremy. That's too many
[248.02s -> 254.06s]  You've done eight if you do nine your chance of dying goes up by eight percent per
[254.64s -> 262.42s]  Bunny you put in a marshmallow you put in there. I'm being audited by the IRS
[262.42s -> 278.43s]  Well, you fucking shouldn't have lied on your taxes. Holy shit and speaking of taxes 20 community subs from lag X
[278.43s -> 284.91s]  That's we're talking about taxes. Thanks. That's a lot of subs. Thanks for the 20 subs like an
[285.51s -> 287.51s]  ink cat gave five oh
[292.53s -> 299.90s]  Taxes but dude dude, how do you taxes on stream? No, that's like the
[300.62s -> 302.62s]  Okay, I would rather
[303.06s -> 307.55s]  I would rather turn the webcam on and be 100% naked
[307.67s -> 313.14s]  No socks on either and have you do my taxes with me on stream
[313.54s -> 317.73s]  Like I'd rather do 20 jumping jacks
[318.53s -> 323.94s]  Completely fucking naked and have a camera over my shoulder while we do my taxes together
[324.38s -> 327.40s]  I
[327.40s -> 328.92s]  know dude
[328.92s -> 340.71s]  Like can I do the naked stream ten times like Satan pops up?
[341.71s -> 343.63s]  Jeremy you have two choices
[343.63s -> 349.07s]  You either do your taxes on stream or you're naked on camera for a stream
[349.07s -> 351.67s]  Can I do ten streams of being naked on camera instead? Oh
[354.29s -> 360.32s]  Yeah, yeah, I guess I would rather do that. Oh, okay
[361.00s -> 363.68s]  Right
[364.64s -> 365.80s]  Disappears
[365.80s -> 378.56s]  Anyways today, we're gonna play the mall game. That's TOS. Yes, it is. I'm not gonna do that. These are hypotheticals
[379.16s -> 382.14s]  So this is gonna be like kind of a chill stream
[382.14s -> 388.32s]  I can't even say that because that always ends up being untrue. This stream is going to be very exciting
[388.84s -> 395.67s]  Okay, it's gonna be the most exciting stream you've ever been to there now the opposite can happen
[395.87s -> 403.69s]  This is a game where you build a mall and there's a bunch of little characters that go to the mall
[403.69s -> 409.73s]  You can build whatever kind of mall you want. It was recommended to me. So I was like, yeah, dude
[409.73s -> 413.43s]  Let's have like a just chill resident sleeper fucking pogchamp stream
[418.88s -> 429.14s]  Casino ink to know this is a lot less wild than casino ink. This is more like city skylines, but it's it
[429.66s -> 430.70s]  concentrated
[430.70s -> 436.82s]  Microscope on the mall aspect of city skylines and I think it's a little bit easier for somebody with a fucking
[437.32s -> 446.14s]  Dumb person brain like me. I'll show you and it's got like nice cute. Everyone just relax. It's gamer time
[446.14s -> 449.15s]  No, it's relaxing time
[449.19s -> 457.11s]  Relaxing time. I was trying to figure out what I want to do. I could either do normal
[458.01s -> 465.15s]  By the way already did the tutorial don't need it. Although there's probably some detailed stuff another interesting thing about this game
[465.15s -> 467.15s]  I don't know if this works, but
[467.99s -> 472.54s]  If it entered apparently like it's pulling people from twitch from this
[472.54s -> 482.71s]  I don't know if you guys are gonna be in the game or something. I don't know. So there's four thousand
[483.07s -> 490.78s]  51 people in the chat. Maybe it's gonna be I don't know. I don't know how this works. Holy shit
[490.78s -> 497.64s]  We get to fuck up his ball. All right. Well right now this I think I might have okay looks good
[497.64s -> 507.75s]  I don't know. There's no like accept or submit button. Is it just pulling these names or K Andy Omega Lo
[508.79s -> 513.01s]  What?
[513.65s -> 521.45s]  4k Andy that's a shitload of people. We're in 4k Andy
[524.16s -> 526.08s]  It's a lot of people
[526.08s -> 532.56s]  That's tons of people. No, there's no there's only
[533.56s -> 539.78s]  35,000 people watching up football Stadium Andy. Is that what you guys say to like the top streamers on twitch?
[541.53s -> 552.71s]  Concert Andy only like a hundred thousand people here concert Andy. Okay, let's go. Look at that number fucking climbing
[553.19s -> 556.40s]  Forty six hundred, let's see what I've refreshed it again. Oh
[557.56s -> 567.82s]  All right, the audio broken it shouldn't be. All right, let's get let's go. Well, there you are. That's you. That's you
[569.38s -> 576.96s]  4.6 K Andy it's been ten minutes. Who cares? All right, so we have to make a mall now
[576.96s -> 583.76s]  Here's the question. Do you want me to play the video game or you know, and you know, there's mild rat infestations
[585.00s -> 591.39s]  Mild shoplifting. I don't know how that works. Would you want me just to start with money and just go for it?
[591.39s -> 604.61s]  I I'm kind of know what I'm doing. Let's go for it. All right, let's go. Look if I can't do shit
[604.61s -> 605.53s]  If I'm like having a hard time
[605.53s -> 609.13s]  I'll just go to the standard mode and we'll have a fucking resident sleeper pogchamp stream
[609.13s -> 612.49s]  And that's what that means. It means it's like oh, this is kind of relaxing for like cool game though, dude
[612.49s -> 621.97s]  All right, $200,000. It's enough normal research. It's fine mild severe rat and I don't want to do that
[621.97s -> 624.84s]  That's probably gonna be such a pain in the ass
[624.88s -> 633.55s]  Wait staff have hunger and bladder needs that's the default. I don't know if I want to do that drop lifting normal
[633.55s -> 635.55s]  These are the people that I don't have so much play default
[635.63s -> 648.06s]  Severe severe severe severe. No, I'm just doing normal standard demands standard prices. Okay, here we go
[648.06s -> 655.30s]  All right. This is what we got to start with pretty tiny. This is our builder. Are they in twitch chat?
[655.30s -> 656.26s]  They are
[656.26s -> 660.70s]  Double zero trash man. Welcome. I don't know who the fuck you are, but you're like the first person therefore
[660.70s -> 665.00s]  You're the most important person. This is the most important person in the stream right now
[665.32s -> 673.59s]  Double zero trash man. Apparently you're 28. Is that real? Is it pulling the person's not here?
[675.35s -> 680.41s]  This is not a person they left the stream. Oh, man, it's too bad. It's too bad
[680.41s -> 689.82s]  They took that 4k Andy joke to heart. It's me. All right, let's see
[689.82s -> 695.18s]  All right, so this is what we got. Look at this shit. Do you see how fucking crazy this could be?
[695.38s -> 701.84s]  Let's all right. Let's do this right every mall I've ever been to pause the game. I don't yeah, it's paused
[702.32s -> 705.70s]  Every single mall I've ever been to always has to start out a certain way
[705.70s -> 715.95s]  I hate with a passion malls that have parking in the middle where they people have to walk out around
[715.95s -> 718.35s]  No, no, no parking in the fucking middle. It's a disaster
[719.03s -> 721.65s]  Parking in huge parking lots on the outside
[721.65s -> 728.22s]  I hate this shit when there's like a road that leads into the middle and there's like parking here and then like
[728.34s -> 733.80s]  Shops all around it. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, I don't like that. I want big parking lot
[734.20s -> 740.44s]  Huge part of the mall big parking lot huge part of the mall big parking lot get those cars out of here
[740.56s -> 747.56s]  They're a distraction. Let's start that here. Okay road work 300 bucks for a road
[748.93s -> 761.68s]  What is this? Why is this little bill? Why is this like a little big center here? That's not a mall. This is all right
[761.68s -> 767.21s]  There's four parking spaces. This is like the maintenance person, right? Yeah, that'd be the builder
[767.37s -> 776.14s]  This is the builder hut they vape wait that they actually you they vape and they they can't and they've been continent
[776.46s -> 785.35s]  What why are these here can't resist e-cigarettes and bladder can't go below 50 can't resist diapers
[788.08s -> 795.90s]  Okay. Well, this is a got a little more interesting. All right, let's go. So I'm gonna say let's start our building here
[796.00s -> 802.45s]  We need a foundation. So I want the first store to be
[802.81s -> 807.48s]  Should I just do like a giant fucking box? Well, that's
[809.24s -> 819.34s]  $942,000 never mind. I cannot. Oh shit what I do. How much money do I have? I have 200 that fuck this mall sucks
[819.34s -> 823.20s]  It's gonna be tiny. How do you make a mall with 200 grain? You need like 200 million
[823.26s -> 830.60s]  All right. Well, it's gonna do a little store first. We'll expand right here. Ready? This is just be like a fucking CVS
[833.00s -> 839.31s]  27 fucking thousand dollars do what the hell is this shit? Okay now we're gonna we're gonna build that up
[839.31s -> 846.73s]  Build is gonna go double zero trash man. I didn't start building you pause the stream. I need to go pee
[846.73s -> 858.34s]  I'll be right back. No, the mall. Is it open? Yeah, you walls one Wendy's
[858.88s -> 864.56s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No. Wait, who's this? What? Who the fuck are you?
[866.12s -> 872.83s]  ASF max it very then there. Okay. This is you manage. Where did you come from?
[873.35s -> 881.72s]  It's fucking bugleberry. All right now. I know everyone's like, oh wow a mouse over and see where I am
[881.72s -> 893.16s]  There's gonna be like 5,000 people on the screen eventually like I can't do that. They're not here either. Not a real wait. Hold on
[896.89s -> 898.89s]  Okay, yeah, okay
[904.80s -> 906.20s]  6k Andy
[906.20s -> 911.23s]  What you just every every time we go up in numbers you just add an Andy after it
[911.49s -> 919.12s]  Alright, so that's it. We got that now we're gonna build we need to have so this is like anybody like a CVS
[920.76s -> 926.75s]  Foundation how much money do I have cuz you have to have a store room. I need a wall here do it

[954.76s -> 959.48s]  There's no door. I need a door here. Alright staff door
[959.48s -> 968.94s]  I don't want anyone just going in here and then a little double door here. Okay, build that shit. There we go
[968.94s -> 971.24s]  Look at these two. Look at these two hard workers
[971.72s -> 976.01s]  Okay, this is like that can I put like a couch in here?
[976.37s -> 984.05s]  All right. Now I need I mean I need a door here staff door and then this is gonna be the storage room
[984.37s -> 988.05s]  So we need to assign that look I did the tutorial already like a fucking stupid idiot
[988.41s -> 992.42s]  So that you have every if it's a store it has to have storage

[1025.62s -> 1031.78s]  How big is this door? This store is a storage room in a bathroom. This be a staff bathroom
[1032.18s -> 1036.59s]  Is this gonna be like half of those stores you go into and it's like, oh, do you guys have a bathroom?
[1036.59s -> 1038.59s]  Oh, yeah, but you ain't going in it. Oh

[9789.18s -> 9798.73s]  This is a huge investment here
[9800.20s -> 9802.04s]  Oh

[9804.52s -> 9806.52s]  This is a huge investment. I'm making a bar
[9820.44s -> 9822.52s]  Shit, it's nine o'clock in the morning. At least i'll be parking
[9827.26s -> 9829.50s]  It's under construction so you can just walk in
[9831.45s -> 9835.21s]  You just park your car walk through the grass and then you're at the frozen food section
[9838.50s -> 9839.94s]  That's so stupid
[9839.94s -> 9841.94s]  Okay, whatever speed it up

[9874.07s -> 9876.07s]  Even though the money we spent come on
[9876.94s -> 9878.71s]  No
[9878.71s -> 9880.71s]  Buy buy buy buy buy buy buy buy

[9930.33s -> 9933.69s]  This is going to be essentials
[9933.69s -> 9939.67s]  Okay, so this is going to be they're going to sell alcohol here
[9940.39s -> 9943.51s]  And then we're going to eventually close the door and turn it into a bar
[9955.96s -> 9966.60s]  87 fucking k. Andy this parking lot sucks
[9967.16s -> 9969.80s]  At least it's turning into kind of an actual place
[9970.44s -> 9983.75s]  Why is the wall all messed up? Um, I don't know. I think because they have to finish building this shit first

[10221.69s -> 10225.83s]  For the bottled waters looks good
[10226.86s -> 10232.39s]  Doc it up now. We have alcohol. I need more research for wine. Okay. Well, whatever we get beers
[10232.39s -> 10236.90s]  It's pretty expensive. Look at please look at the link. All right. Hold on relax
[10245.53s -> 10259.59s]  This is just creepy
[10260.23s -> 10263.19s]  I'm just looking up and seeing that would you still shop here?
[10263.83s -> 10280.50s]  All right, what if the prices were really low like we're talking one dollar for a large soda at mcdonald's low if everything was like
[10280.82s -> 10285.24s]  80 off but sometimes that guy would just
[10286.68s -> 10290.70s]  Reach in and like pick up somebody and just go like
[10291.90s -> 10295.77s]  Just drop him and swallow him. He did it like once an hour would you
[10296.97s -> 10306.71s]  Would you still shop there?
[10306.71s -> 10312.23s]  No, okay. So let's say this let's say a thousand people go in there in an hour
[10312.55s -> 10314.94s]  That's a one out of a thousand chance
[10314.94s -> 10318.60s]  That's gonna be you
[10318.60s -> 10322.44s]  And like I I didn't say you couldn't like run around and like grab like something and like throw it at him and try
[10322.44s -> 10328.46s]  To get away and like dodge behind stuff. You can do that. He might not get you. He might just be like
[10330.38s -> 10336.22s]  And just go for the person over there still no talking we're talking 80 off everything in the whole store
[10336.70s -> 10345.34s]  Come on, give me some more money. We gotta fill these parking spaces. Nobody wants anything in here. What do they want halloween?
[10346.52s -> 10350.20s]  Candy and greeting cards. I can do that. Let's do that refill this candy and greeting cards
[10350.52s -> 10353.98s]  This is all school supplies get this shit out of here
[10353.98s -> 10363.18s]  I was oh we need food shelves. Oh candy candy candy candy candy school supplies things is done
[10368.41s -> 10374.97s]  Although i'd wait outside until I saw somebody get grabbed and then I'd go in okay
[10375.05s -> 10378.06s]  So that's that's not a bad strategy
[10378.06s -> 10380.30s]  What if you pulled up there and you don't know when the last time you did it was?
[10381.38s -> 10383.86s]  Like what if you pulled up there and he's sitting there just looking down
[10384.58s -> 10386.76s]  How can you tell how do you know?
[10386.76s -> 10389.90s]  When he did it you would just wait an hour
[10390.14s -> 10396.14s]  So you would sit there for a full hour and then when you saw him grab someone then you would go in
[10397.18s -> 10406.47s]  So it's worth waiting a full hour in the parking lot. Just sit the way listen to talk radio
[10407.03s -> 10413.67s]  Now with a parking lot is you can't sit in there for more than an hour
[10415.21s -> 10419.13s]  Every one of the parking spaces has like a meter on it and when you like pull in it's like
[10419.61s -> 10428.73s]  It's like a 20 minute meter goes starts to counting down if you don't get the hell out of there
[10428.73s -> 10435.88s]  You gotta pull out within 20 minutes or his eyes just
[10437.00s -> 10443.13s]  Go right over to your car and he just puts his hand up and he's like the hulk grabs you and like just
[10444.25s -> 10450.30s]  Throws you into the atmosphere
[10450.30s -> 10454.62s]  Still going just park somewhere else and walk
[10455.58s -> 10456.54s]  Park, okay
[10456.54s -> 10460.94s]  So if you park here you park it like over here and like camp out overnight and just with binoculars
[10461.88s -> 10465.56s]  And then just wait and see when he does it and then like what but it's good. What if it takes you
[10466.12s -> 10468.92s]  It's gonna take you like 40 30 40 minutes to walk this far
[10470.79s -> 10474.87s]  By the time you get here you have probably like 20 minutes to get the fuck out of there
[10475.03s -> 10487.85s]  How far do you live from the store? I don't know. You might like live here. You might be like camped out here
[10489.42s -> 10491.78s]  Play the video game
[10491.78s -> 10495.30s]  Hey, i'll tell you when i'm ready to play the video game. All right, bro
[10496.18s -> 10503.38s]  Will you research the bar already so I can do this shit? Come on. You're at a profit for the day
[10503.94s -> 10507.45s]  Take a look at that
[10507.45s -> 10514.84s]  Mm-hmm. Everyone thought it was over. Everyone thought it was over when we hit that bottom. No, we're back
[10515.24s -> 10521.45s]  It doesn't take you 30 minutes to walk less than a mile. This is not less than a mile
[10522.36s -> 10531.50s]  It's probably like five miles 53
[10533.06s -> 10538.26s]  Can I afford to put another two desks in here? What do you think? I think I can afford it
[10538.74s -> 10547.74s]  He's never walked in his life. He's a car pick him up
[10554.04s -> 10557.72s]  Yeah, guys like my like feet are like so like
[10558.34s -> 10559.80s]  sensitive and soft
[10559.80s -> 10562.76s]  Because i've never walked I I just like have somebody pick me up
[10563.24s -> 10567.88s]  And like walk me to to a car carry me and like put me in the back seat
[10567.88s -> 10570.28s]  And then they drive me somewhere and then somebody puts me in a carriage
[10570.97s -> 10580.68s]  And they push me around the store and I pointed stuff if I like walked two or three steps and be like, ah, ah, yeah
[10580.84s -> 10614.33s]  Somebody pick me up. I've never used them. I make them look no stop. Stop what just stop
[10618.38s -> 10630.07s]  Just stop get back in here and build that. All right, we need uh, another person in the way
[10630.15s -> 10632.95s]  We can do five. All right, five. We'll do five people in the office. I got money
[10633.19s -> 10641.80s]  I need three people. No two more people in the office who we hire. You're digging yourself deeper
[10644.71s -> 10661.11s]  Why do you assume that I have a shovel in my hand because of the grave what minus two?
[10661.35s -> 10669.05s]  Fuck you that sucked what i'm saying what what you assume that i'm like even aware of what i'm even talking about
[10674.17s -> 10677.85s]  That was that wasn't even a joke. That was me just like oh you're digging you're digging
[10678.49s -> 10680.65s]  Yourself deeper and i'm like why you think I got a shovel
[10680.73s -> 10686.55s]  No, that's like a rebuttal to like you think I what do you think I know what you're talking about is smart
[10686.87s -> 10700.62s]  It was very smart
[10700.62s -> 10709.75s]  All right, I gotta hire people. I can't keep up with this. Um, mute it. That's just mute the stream
[10709.75s -> 10725.08s]  That's how I do it 53. Okay hire. Uh, I need to assign this that would be good if I did that
[10725.40s -> 10738.55s]  I don't even like this game hire office worker
[10746.02s -> 10755.75s]  Actually, uh you you too
[10757.93s -> 10773.06s]  You're better. All right, that's that's a full office now. Thanks for breaking completely twitch. What happened? What happened twitch is messed up right now

[13940.46s -> 13946.00s]  Jimmy kimmel has more of a larger audience than germa 985

[13954.84s -> 13957.24s]  Oh mega love these he's a nobody
[13959.53s -> 13962.09s]  You know in the grand scheme of things guys, yeah

[13971.29s -> 13974.81s]  yet, not yet
[13974.81s -> 13980.25s]  Let's see
[13980.25s -> 13985.30s]  Holy shit, man. Look at all this money. I need another I need more cashiers. How slow are these cashiers?
[13986.98s -> 13991.50s]  Not bad. I think they level up. I need another I need more checkouts
[13992.87s -> 13995.62s]  This is naughty. This is bad
[14006.60s -> 14013.14s]  Okay, is it weird that I want to just build a checkout counter here with like five checkouts
[14013.70s -> 14023.69s]  Connected to the same store essentials. So then they have to walk across the street and check out there's no more room
[14023.77s -> 14025.82s]  It's surrounded by roads
[14025.82s -> 14027.82s]  I guess I could take some of this out and put it here
[14028.54s -> 14037.10s]  Our is really not doing that. Well, i'm not happy with the performance here
[14037.74s -> 14042.98s]  Nobody's coming in to drink
[14042.98s -> 14062.86s]  All right. We're okay. We're doing all right almost time to start the bookstore profits. Not bad. What do we got?
[14063.42s -> 14068.33s]  People want to go see major movie release. Fuck. It's too many things
[14070.30s -> 14074.06s]  Almost have enough for books when that's done. We're doing books. How many people will work here?
[14075.77s -> 14079.99s]  Is there all right?
[14079.99s -> 14085.82s]  Parking lot's getting a little full
[14085.82s -> 14087.82s]  Hope you don't plan on becoming an architect
[14088.31s -> 14091.51s]  No, i'm 35. I don't think that's a career choice. I'm gonna start now
[14092.46s -> 14098.15s]  I don't think i'm gonna just go to like 10 years of architect school. I don't think so
[14100.14s -> 14102.14s]  Not something I was very good at anyways
[14102.30s -> 14109.99s]  So it's already something I know i'm not very good at and I have to go to a lot of school for that
[14110.39s -> 14112.84s]  It would be 45 or so when I started
[14113.64s -> 14115.61s]  Maybe 50
[14115.61s -> 14119.61s]  I'd work on maybe one or two major projects and get fired from them because I screwed something up
[14120.76s -> 14122.94s]  52 get fired. Okay
[14122.94s -> 14136.68s]  I don't know if I want to do that camel has 2.2 million viewers. You have 1.1 million. No
[14137.32s -> 14146.74s]  That's not how that works
[14146.74s -> 14149.70s]  You didn't want to have an enclosed mall with parking. Yeah, I did
[14150.92s -> 14154.44s]  I wanted it to be parking this huge parking lot around it and then everything inside
[14154.92s -> 14158.94s]  And then like we got a bar over here, but that's not I don't even own this
[14161.08s -> 14163.08s]  Big money today. Come on
[14163.72s -> 14166.17s]  growth more growth
[14166.17s -> 14174.76s]  Growth growth growth don't let these people leave without paying come on. Bring them up. Don't close the door
[14175.40s -> 14177.64s]  Close the door lock the door lock the door
[14180.06s -> 14187.00s]  That's so much product that would just let them go for free. How could you be angry?
[14187.80s -> 14192.20s]  Imagine being that angry and getting out of here with like fucking 180 dollars worth of shit for free
[14193.00s -> 14210.25s]  Why are you so mad about that? All right, we still grew almost ready for the bookstore. I need another cashier
[14211.77s -> 14213.53s]  I'll put it right here
[14213.53s -> 14216.65s]  That's more that's another employee though. Can I afford that?
[14217.29s -> 14221.62s]  Let's move some stuff around
[14221.62s -> 14223.62s]  All right, move some shit around here
[14224.22s -> 14230.22s]  This is going up. We need to really reorganize this place. This place sucks the complete reorganization of this place
[14235.42s -> 14237.42s]  M move up here
[14238.02s -> 14239.42s]  move
[14239.42s -> 14243.18s]  Here move here move it put it right here
[14243.98s -> 14253.45s]  A little off. I hate it, but it's okay
[14254.01s -> 14257.48s]  This is gonna be plenty of room for checkout counter
[14268.30s -> 14269.98s]  That one little thing
[14269.98s -> 14287.50s]  It's all right. Don't matter. Let's do that first so I can look at what it looks like
[14288.06s -> 14301.13s]  Yeah, you gotta move this stuff I already said make it all vertical, please i'm begging you
[14307.00s -> 14326.46s]  All even how vertical this is so much cleaner you do all your shopping here
[14326.78s -> 14329.82s]  And then we'll do some checkout line. This is gonna be so much more efficient
[14332.15s -> 14343.80s]  Make it symmetrical. I don't know what to do with this guy. I do I can't make it symmetrical doesn't matter
[14345.42s -> 14349.34s]  This down here. This is like the checkout line people in the checkout line can kind of browse
[14352.20s -> 14359.56s]  Need more room though check out that
[14360.68s -> 14362.68s]  Uh, no put this
[14363.32s -> 14367.72s]  Over here. No, no, no, no idiot. That's where the other checkout counter is gonna go
[14368.84s -> 14370.28s]  You dumb
[14370.28s -> 14373.80s]  You're not even smart like me
[14373.80s -> 14376.36s]  Okay, then this can we just wish up with these?
[14377.00s -> 14384.01s]  Remember, this isn't a mall
[14384.01s -> 14386.20s]  Okay
[14386.20s -> 14388.20s]  When a bookstore gets opened here
[14388.70s -> 14392.22s]  It's gonna be a mall. You'll have a grocery store and booze
[14392.84s -> 14397.66s]  Emporium a bar and a bookstore. That's like a strip mall
[14398.30s -> 14401.90s]  All I just the only thing I need here is I need a sub shop in a verizon store
[14402.54s -> 14404.54s]  And then what would you call it? That's a mall
[14404.62s -> 14412.55s]  The bar that opens at 10 in the morning
[14412.71s -> 14417.83s]  Just make it a walmart you redditor
[14418.31s -> 14425.05s]  This is a bunch of storefronts. Yeah, you park your car and you can like go into the verizon store
[14425.69s -> 14427.69s]  And then you can go into the sub shop
[14428.86s -> 14431.58s]  and then you can like go into the grocery store get some stuff and you can just
[14431.98s -> 14436.06s]  Have go over here to have a have like a fucking fresh fruit platter
[14437.64s -> 14439.72s]  Get a drink to go
[14439.72s -> 14441.48s]  And like well, no not like that

[14506.84s -> 14514.92s]  Yeah, I guess you know the people sit at bars. I know you can sit at a bar, but what?
[14515.48s -> 14524.97s]  It's for the atmosphere. This person no parking allowed here. What are you doing? Oh, no, that's a staff member. Okay

[17687.29s -> 17691.13s]  You wonder why I haven't been able to build anything and make any real money
[17691.77s -> 17696.15s]  It's because like 30 of all my margins are destroyed by builders walking out
[17696.63s -> 17708.10s]  Why do I have so many cashiers? I think there was huge demand you missed it
[17717.74s -> 17718.70s]  All right
[17718.70s -> 17722.31s]  Let's let this run out for a second and then I need to make a movie theater

[17763.51s -> 17778.73s]  They're not stealing this right now. You have to pay up front. What are you doing here? Oh, this is the overnight
[17779.42s -> 17783.75s]  Uh stock person who kind of only needed you for one day

[17791.78s -> 17795.62s]  Okay guys
[17795.62s -> 17803.86s]  You can just open these doors and just grab a jug of milk and leave I need to
[17804.65s -> 17820.18s]  Oh, you have to only be able to come in from one place. You don't even need to step in the store. You can just
[17821.54s -> 17826.76s]  Reach in and grab something and before even putting your body into this store, you can leave
[17832.14s -> 17837.35s]  Do not know that I didn't know I I kind of didn't I didn't know you could do that
[17837.67s -> 17847.54s]  I thought the security was like people fighting. I don't know. I thought like every time the security in a video game. It's usually
[17848.49s -> 17854.09s]  Just like a security guard stands here. And if there's a fight they break it up in every sim game ever played
[17859.27s -> 17863.43s]  Hey, how's that? Did you steal that? Did you steal that? Did you steal that?
[17863.99s -> 17868.15s]  Did you steal that you stole that you just grabbed it off the table and walked out you stole that
[17869.10s -> 17887.22s]  You stole that I can't believe it. I can't believe this much isn't going by. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. He has something
[17887.94s -> 17889.85s]  He has something too
[17889.85s -> 17893.29s]  Why is it just free food at Jeremy's? This is ridiculous
[17894.86s -> 17896.86s]  He had a bag of groceries
[17897.50s -> 17908.26s]  I don't even think these doors are locked. Can people just come in?
[17908.82s -> 17913.72s]  This is why you need a two-entrance mall and not a promenade
[17919.11s -> 17921.35s]  Oh, I can't I still can't believe
[17922.63s -> 17934.87s]  It's just people walking out with shit like more than 50 plus times a day 20 at least 20 to 30 times a day
[17935.19s -> 17946.50s]  You you know what? Go home. You're wasting money. Hey, hey, that doesn't mean you can take things
[17962.17s -> 17967.46s]  Ah, I got I can't laugh that hard right now. That's very that's very funny that this has been going on the whole time
[17968.02s -> 17975.77s]  Oh, well, is there a way I can see how many times a specific thing has been stolen from that would be so funny
[17976.17s -> 17983.99s]  Like if I could look at that and see how many times somebody took out of it, dude, you're so charitable. Thank you
[17986.94s -> 17988.94s]  Are you treating your employees ethically?
[17989.54s -> 17995.14s]  Well, um, I bet you half of them have been walking out with free groceries every day. So sure I guess
[17998.47s -> 18006.33s]  There's no metal detector here. There's no cameras take only what you need
[18006.89s -> 18015.51s]  That's a guy that doesn't work. You know what happens to the halloween
[18016.23s -> 18019.11s]  Bowl that says honesty one, please
[18020.04s -> 18023.62s]  That whole bowl is gone and i'm not just talking about the candy inside
[18023.70s -> 18028.66s]  I'm talking about the bowl too is gone within five minutes of it being out there
[18037.03s -> 18039.75s]  And then and then that sign that says honesty take one
[18040.87s -> 18052.90s]  Is covered in some kind of shaving cream that policy doesn't work. The sign is gone, too
[18052.98s -> 18058.58s]  Yeah, oh the signs kicked over and there's like five or six distinct foot like shoe prints all over it
[18062.47s -> 18064.47s]  He knows because he was the one that did it
[18064.63s -> 18078.02s]  No, I never did that. I never did that. I didn't even take candy out of that bowl, you know

[19792.81s -> 19809.02s]  Well, just give it a minute now. I think I got more these bags of trash have been there
[19809.10s -> 19819.58s]  So I need another janitor. Look people are buying your detector is gone. It's all right. No one's stealing anymore
[19819.66s -> 19823.30s]  So I need to actually I think I need another janitor
[19824.76s -> 19828.36s]  The seats are backwards i'm not going to go through the process. They're still watching the movie. It's fine
[19828.84s -> 19834.30s]  Okay, I need I need some staff
[19838.01s -> 19840.65s]  I need at least one or two more janitors. This is ridiculous
[19852.41s -> 19858.14s]  Please no, no, no one's coming to the movies anymore
[19858.86s -> 19862.18s]  All right, get back in here and watch the movies
[19870.47s -> 19876.76s]  Okay, pretty cool so far. I need a trash can. Yep
[19877.40s -> 19888.20s]  Here we go. There it's gonna get cleaned up now
[19889.72s -> 19905.78s]  That's better much better much better much better much better. It's currently movies were really in high demand
[19905.78s -> 19918.34s]  I hit it pretty well movies are still in high demand yesterday's sales. Look at that. Come on and go to the movies already
[19924.26s -> 19944.90s]  What the fuck is this?
[19944.90s -> 19945.78s]  there
[19945.78s -> 19962.87s]  Clean the seat is a trash can the trash can is a seat either or however you want to do it movies close at six
[19963.19s -> 19975.78s]  Oh, that's stupid. How do I um change that?
[19977.53s -> 19994.01s]  Take it lobby opens 9 a.m. Who goes to a movie at 9 a.m. Here we go. That's better movies at midnight
[19994.82s -> 20003.35s]  Matinee 11 10 that's good. And now the workers have to be doing that too. This is nobody here
[20011.05s -> 20038.25s]  What is all this going on? You start here? What is going on down there? That's the sales. All right, let's keep going
[20040.31s -> 20045.64s]  I've not all the parking spaces are there but the whole thing with a drugstore. I don't get it
[20045.64s -> 20059.32s]  All right movie theater is made dude. Look at that. How does it make any sense? I don't understand how this works. Um,
[20059.88s -> 20061.62s]  I've sold like
[20061.62s -> 20063.08s]  150 tickets
[20063.16s -> 20081.98s]  I made 38 dollars. What's up with that? Hopefully that changes increase the price. I don't think you can
[20082.38s -> 20089.78s]  I think it's just automatic. I just realized i've been streaming for five and a half hours
[20092.87s -> 20097.85s]  This is in in new new vegas arc. This is longer than I thought I was gonna be here for
[20098.09s -> 20103.98s]  How come there's nobody where oh right because it doesn't open till later
[20105.54s -> 20107.54s]  All right movies theater is about to open
[20107.62s -> 20125.74s]  Nobody's stealing anything movie theater is open in three two one open come on in movies are open
[20128.81s -> 20161.77s]  Really come on, what's with the big showing I need a big showing how's it still 38 dollars
[20166.71s -> 20199.53s]  60 000 investment and i've made 38 bucks from it. That's nice. It can't even be accurate like the employee hours shows the sales
[20199.77s -> 20204.52s]  Okay, we had a big spike
[20204.52s -> 20206.52s]  18 somewhere around like 15
[20207.24s -> 20216.95s]  I mean that there's nobody wants to see a movie. What the fuck spiked two
[20219.05s -> 20236.89s]  Should be the morning overnight. Okay, we're gonna do shift planning. Okay you oh, I didn't even do this
[20237.13s -> 20249.42s]  Take a look at that. Now there's infinite overlap. We're gonna open at four and we're gonna close at midnight at 21
[20251.59s -> 20262.25s]  Infinite we open at four. We open at six. We close
[20265.40s -> 20285.29s]  23 there you go. Now we got a lot of time here fill it up. Imagine seeing a movie at six in the morning
[20285.37s -> 20291.75s]  Yeah, I would not who watches movies at 6 a.m

[20326.31s -> 20330.28s]  What happened? What what happened? Why'd you leave?
[20339.80s -> 20353.82s]  One guy in the whole parking lot. It's an early bird. I should make a diner. Okay, here comes the crowd
[20353.82s -> 20355.82s]  Here comes the lunch crowd
[20360.66s -> 20366.02s]  Um the okay the profit stuff doesn't make any sense this oh this I had this open for
[20366.58s -> 20375.40s]  Almost six hours. We've made way more than three or four thousand dollars here. Oh security too. What can I guard?
[20375.96s -> 20391.56s]  What can I do? Let me look at that demand fresh meat. I got it arcade games. I don't have that
[20391.88s -> 20402.62s]  What's the research? What was security to self-balancing scooters security guards?
[20403.18s -> 20429.59s]  How do I hire a security guard?
[20429.67s -> 20435.16s]  I can't make a security guard. I need a security area like a building for them
[20438.47s -> 20440.15s]  security center
[20440.15s -> 20465.22s]  Just a little one. It's the tiny one just big enough for them to be somewhere like over like here security center
[20466.58s -> 20467.54s]  Okay
[20467.54s -> 20476.66s]  I need to make door here staff door. This is for security people only. All right. So now what do I do?
[20477.53s -> 20480.47s]  manage the security store
[20482.68s -> 20490.68s]  hire guard security
[20491.21s -> 20495.13s]  You okay pick a patrol for your guard. All right edit patrols
[20497.29s -> 20500.95s]  I want you right here here here
[20501.69s -> 20503.50s]  here

[20518.46s -> 20531.46s]  Okay, there's like a couch. He's one person
[20531.94s -> 20538.60s]  Yeah, I know he'll get the job done. I'm like the stream's over in like 10 minutes. Anyways, I don't care
[20541.91s -> 20564.07s]  Where are they something's wrong? Wait, what it's definitely this is where all the money is made in here
[20567.99s -> 20578.15s]  Just right here. Is that better patrol edit patrol? What's going on with this left click to extend patrol?
[20578.95s -> 20579.83s]  Oh
[20579.83s -> 20598.58s]  You have to actually draw this shit. Okay, that's good. Let's do it. What does he work?
[20598.98s -> 20620.70s]  Why is it why is it such a low battery? Is he working? I just want to see him
[20621.62s -> 20628.14s]  Make sure they're doing their job. Yeah, I just wanted to walk around here. No more theft
[20628.54s -> 20635.82s]  I'm not gonna get robbed anymore. This game is pretty fun. I kind of really like this. It's really fun
[20636.87s -> 20641.40s]  Now imagine if you had all this
[20641.40s -> 20646.65s]  Here's the thing though. If you're gonna do sandbox mode give yourself like 50 million dollars
[20648.31s -> 20651.83s]  Because it's very expensive and we didn't even get to crash the surface over here
[20651.99s -> 20669.72s]  I want to see him and then i'm gonna call it here. I'll call it here. I want I gotta get up
[20676.34s -> 20678.18s]  mall fortress
[20678.18s -> 20683.72s]  This is definitely made more than 200 bucks that's lagging data. That's like two months behind
[20695.06s -> 20715.64s]  There is uh, don't you have a route? Excuse me. Go out go out the door, dude
[20717.86s -> 20726.44s]  Go out the door and do your work. You can't cross the parking lot

[20818.47s -> 20820.71s]  No, not pokemon ai this guy's doing this

[20828.50s -> 20830.50s]  It's just gonna go

[20850.49s -> 20853.69s]  I have so much time to pay that loan. I'm fine. I have a hundred days to pay it
[20859.94s -> 20861.62s]  I think this is pretty cool
[20861.62s -> 20868.47s]  Okay, we got a restaurant. We've got a security spot. We've got a bar
[20869.11s -> 20872.78s]  There's a movie theater

[20881.67s -> 20886.73s]  Hey, what is this place for people to fuck just slack off?
[20888.46s -> 20890.46s]  A bar in a theater that no one go to
[20890.62s -> 20897.93s]  Well, just wait until it's be like another expansion this way with like another big thing
[20898.49s -> 20903.77s]  I'm making money. It's not making a lot of money, but i'm making money

[20939.30s -> 20947.13s]  This is a lot of fun though. I feel the same way about this that I felt about something like city skylines
[20948.26s -> 20950.74s]  Do you actually understand design and architecture?
[20951.30s -> 20953.21s]  I mean, it's just fun to do

[21045.78s -> 21046.10s]  Okay
[21046.10s -> 21048.66s]  If jimmy kimmel raided the stream that means it'd probably be like
[21049.30s -> 21057.94s]  200,000 concurrent viewers and I would have to keep the stream going. No, you know what I probably just leave
[21059.21s -> 21066.92s]  That's I am that streams over two hundred thousand people raid. I'd be like guys. I'm leaving
[21068.44s -> 21074.94s]  Come tomorrow if you want to hang out. That's toxic. Is it?

[21157.45s -> 21161.96s]  Uh, I don't you know, it's really hard to do that because when I hit end stream
[21162.44s -> 21165.16s]  I think it actually takes a few seconds for it to actually turn the stream off
[21167.61s -> 21170.81s]  Oh, by the way, uh, also something uh that I forgot and I didn't really know
[21171.29s -> 21172.66s]  um
[21172.66s -> 21174.58s]  This is dead serious
[21174.58s -> 21176.58s]  I mean this with all of my heart
[21176.82s -> 21179.94s]  This is not me making something up
[21179.94s -> 21181.62s]  the ow thing
[21181.62s -> 21185.91s]  When the janitor walks over and bumps into the thing and you guys say ow I thought
[21186.47s -> 21188.47s]  For the last two straight years
[21188.47s -> 21193.27s]  That you were talking about like oh he bumped into me. He bumped into my face
[21194.06s -> 21202.41s]  I didn't know there was a loud sound on it. I did not know that until three days ago
[21211.21s -> 21214.01s]  I thought it was because here he comes. He oh he bumped you
[21214.73s -> 21229.19s]  I did not know there was even a sound effect on it. That's not why
[21229.75s -> 21234.31s]  I was doing it because of the bump not the sound but wait, is is there a sound?
[21234.47s -> 21238.70s]  How come I don't hear the sound when he does it? I'm curious
[21242.58s -> 21249.77s]  How come there was no sound there? There's no sound there
[21253.69s -> 21260.97s]  It was how come I didn't hear it there is sound it's like a wet slap
