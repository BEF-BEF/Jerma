[0.18s -> 16.34s]  I look like shit right there. Can I take a better picture? Why is it the same picture?
[16.34s -> 26.94s]  Oh no, I got sucked into the comic book. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Come fight me.
[26.94s -> 29.57s]  Get fucking slapped.
[31.57s -> 40.67s]  Yeah, you want to see how we do a backflip into the devil slap?
[40.67s -> 51.10s]  I got two. I got to fight two of them. Just come closer. Come on.
[51.10s -> 53.10s]  I'm just going with the slaps now.
[62.13s -> 69.27s]  Got the kick. Oh, she just kicked me right in the face. What the fuck am I doing by the way?
[69.27s -> 72.27s]  Why am I like sitting on the ground? Got to use the uppercut.
[78.85s -> 80.85s]  Again with the power punch. I'm not kicking him.
[83.41s -> 91.51s]  Yeah, did you see that kick? Where did I end up? How did I get up here?
[91.51s -> 98.19s]  Alright, how do I get down? Like I got to jump over again, right?
[98.19s -> 107.60s]  Shit. Can I go down like this ladder? I don't think I can go down the ladder.
[107.60s -> 118.31s]  I'm stuck up here. What the fuck? Here we go.
[127.06s -> 131.67s]  I'm back up here again. What, the boxes?
[132.67s -> 137.73s]  Give me the box. Give me the trash can.
[138.73s -> 141.03s]  Oh, fuck it. I just hit my hand on it.
[142.03s -> 151.59s]  That's what I call the window washer. Get cleaned up.
[152.59s -> 159.26s]  Who's left? Oh, you? Oh, you? I saved the best for you.
[164.86s -> 169.85s]  Shit. This game's fucking hard.
[169.85s -> 179.36s]  Stay low. Dude, look at that. How are you supposed to beat this guy unless you stay low?
[179.36s -> 184.39s]  I can't even see what's going on on the screen. All I know is I'm picking his ass.
[184.39s -> 189.40s]  I literally beat him. I beat him. Victory.
[204.01s -> 209.06s]  Can I just say, I'm getting really tired right now.
[209.06s -> 214.54s]  Because unlike any other game that's like this, I really have to fight these guys.
[214.54s -> 219.54s]  It's not like I have to like pretend punch. I have to really fucking punch these guys.
[219.54s -> 225.54s]  I have to like actually throw swings, you know, and fucking ground pound.
[225.54s -> 237.36s]  Is this how fast I can fucking run?
[237.36s -> 250.76s]  I'm back. This time I'm brandishing a weapon.
[250.76s -> 262.57s]  This lightsaber or $4.52 grocery store Whipple Ball bat is going to help me achieve victory.
[270.94s -> 274.94s]  Just call me baseball player.
[281.19s -> 282.75s]  Did I die?
[282.75s -> 296.09s]  Even with a baseball bat, I broke something.
[296.09s -> 301.66s]  It was a lampshade. Don't worry.
[301.66s -> 303.66s]  See what I got? Out of here.
[303.66s -> 306.66s]  See what I got in my hands? It was a ball bat.
[306.66s -> 310.22s]  Fucking God. I can't use this.
[311.22s -> 314.86s]  Here we go. Nice and easy.
[314.86s -> 318.17s]  Just like you're hitting the ball up midfield past the second baseman.
[318.17s -> 320.54s]  And you can queue up a power attack in a second.
[320.54s -> 325.90s]  Right when he's at pretty much like low health, we're going to queue up a power swing for a home run.
[325.90s -> 330.47s]  Here we go. This is what we're going to do. We're going to step into it.
[333.12s -> 345.41s]  We're good. Hey, hey!
[345.41s -> 349.99s]  This is stupid. This is extremely dangerous.
[349.99s -> 353.99s]  Like what I'm doing right now could be the dumbest idea I've ever had.
[353.99s -> 359.99s]  Hey, let me go buy a Whipple Ball bat and like put duct tape all around it so you can see it so I can just break all this shit in my room.
[359.99s -> 362.99s]  What was I thinking? What was I thinking?
[362.99s -> 364.99s]  What was I thinking? Seriously, what was I thinking?
[364.99s -> 367.23s]  I don't even need that weapon.
[367.23s -> 375.16s]  See? I'm actually doing better without the weapon and my shit in my room is intact.
[375.16s -> 381.86s]  One more.
[381.86s -> 384.17s]  Shit, I missed. I got him.
[384.17s -> 388.52s]  What a dumb idea.
