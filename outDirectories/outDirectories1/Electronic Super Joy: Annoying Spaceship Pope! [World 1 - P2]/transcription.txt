[0.31s -> 18.86s]  Let's just go. Forget waiting for anything, man. Just move. Missiles, you know, screw
[18.86s -> 25.02s]  the missiles. Take them out when you can take them out and just move up the friggin' tower.
[25.02s -> 29.84s]  See the missiles are way far behind now. Stay ahead of the missiles. And then you can just
[29.84s -> 43.57s]  double smash them like... Oh! I thought that was a good plan. Turned out it was a pretty
[43.81s -> 52.40s]  bad plan. Don't make the screen go that far up. Just do it nice and gently. No, I did
[52.40s -> 69.52s]  it again. I did it again. Stop doing that. There we go. Okay. Mother. God. Please make
[69.52s -> 79.27s]  it. What does this asshole have to say now? Don't waste time. Stop floating around. Stomp
[79.27s -> 96.17s]  on those missiles. Okay, I can't touch those without doing the stomp. I'll be fine. Jump
[96.17s -> 106.51s]  up the sticky chamber. Perfect. All right. Where am I? That might be too risky to try
[106.51s -> 112.13s]  to get. I think that might be a little too risky. I never said I was going to gold star
[112.13s -> 116.53s]  every level. I never said that. Nobody can quote me on that. All I said I was going to
[116.53s -> 120.49s]  beat the game in like 10 minutes and it's been like probably 40. I don't even know how
[120.49s -> 135.57s]  long it's been. I'm just getting spammed with missiles right now. Look at all this nonsense.
[135.57s -> 147.41s]  I got to sit up for this. Sit up straight. Got to clear them before they become too out
[147.41s -> 166.12s]  of control. That's the theory. God. This is going to be a pain in the ass, man. These
[166.12s -> 177.75s]  missiles are going to be a thing for the rest of the game. I can already tell. Get out of
[177.75s -> 193.10s]  my face. Get away from me. I got the checkpoint. That's all that matters. I've got to stop
[193.10s -> 205.85s]  doing that. Why do they have to jump? Why do those things have to jump? Is there a reason
[205.85s -> 215.94s]  why they have to be jumping? Don't break your keyboard. What are you, Star? I only have
[215.94s -> 220.02s]  like one keyboard. I can't like afford to smash it into the ground. I'm not even using
[220.02s -> 227.17s]  a keyboard. I'm using a controller. Playing this game on a keyboard would be awful. It
[227.17s -> 231.70s]  would be mind-melting how hard this would be on a controller. This is not even that
[231.70s -> 249.47s]  difficult. I just need to slow down and stop being such a psychopath. I'm getting this
[249.47s -> 255.97s]  right now. Get out of here, you giant like fucking wildebeest. Did I touch the flag?
[255.97s -> 271.34s]  I touched the flag, right? I did. Good. Thank God. Let's get the hell out of here. Another
[271.34s -> 287.36s]  flag. Don't even destroy those. They're just to mess with you. That's the only reason why
[287.36s -> 290.76s]  these missiles are even here in this level. Just to mess with you. They're going a little
[290.76s -> 303.59s]  bit too fast. I did it. Hooray. The Pope. What did that say about the Pope? The Pope
[303.59s -> 314.42s]  has gone insane. That's too bad. Or been mind-controlled. Anyway, he wants to kill you. Pope wants to
[314.42s -> 322.79s]  kill me now. Guess you'll have to murder him. Oh well. So I gotta go kill the Pope? That's
[322.79s -> 337.03s]  the Pope? What's the Pope doing in this weird world? So I gotta go kill the Pope. Howdy.
[337.03s -> 348.51s]  Hi Pope. I'm the Pope. And I'm gonna fuck you up. Wow. Pope-tastic. What a dick. Is
[348.51s -> 359.42s]  this a boss fight? Alright, let's go. You think this is a spaceship? Alright, Pope.
[359.42s -> 370.73s]  You asked for it. I didn't know that was gonna be a thing. Okay. Here we go. Go. Oh man,
[370.73s -> 378.52s]  this is gonna be hard. This is gonna be hard. That dumbass screen shake at the very beginning
[378.52s -> 385.15s]  is really messing me up. Hey, what's like shake your screen? Like, look at violently
[385.15s -> 395.68s]  for like a second of... Whoa. I pulled that out of my ass. I like looked away from this.
[395.68s -> 411.75s]  This is... I don't even know about this one, guys. I don't know about this one. Fuck! I'm
[411.75s -> 418.23s]  doing something wrong. I'm going the wrong way. This is a bad route. I gotta beat him
[418.23s -> 424.81s]  up there. Let's go. There we go. Okay. Keep it going. I have to be way in front of all
[424.81s -> 442.21s]  that. Bull crap. No checkpoint flags. I don't see any checkpoint flags, by the way. Alright.
[442.21s -> 448.58s]  That was it. We built a spaceship. Jump in. Is this gonna turn into like a side-scrolling
[448.58s -> 457.30s]  shooter? Oh wow. It really is. This really is like a side... I can't believe it. That's
[457.30s -> 471.09s]  what this is. This thing handles like a slug. I can't move at all. Wow. Come on. You're
[471.09s -> 475.57s]  gonna turn this into like a bullet hell game? Are you kidding me right now? You've gotta
[475.57s -> 483.25s]  be fucking kidding me. You've got to be kidding me. Stay as far back as you can get and just...
[483.25s -> 486.45s]  I'm just tapping A right now and just weaving. That's all I'm gonna be doing. I'm just looking
[486.45s -> 496.23s]  at the bullet hell. Is that... Come on. He's almost got the shield down. Get rid of that
[496.23s -> 514.05s]  shield. Shield gone. Hit him. Good. Alright. Out of gas. Oh well. What the hell is that?
[514.05s -> 522.73s]  What the hell is that? I have a rocket launcher. Oh, alright. Yeah. Nice. Shoot him. Shoot this...
[522.73s -> 526.06s]  This is gonna be... This is gonna be a cake, man. I'm just gonna shoot this... Just shoot
[526.06s -> 532.49s]  him like probably like five times. Complete the level. Shoot the rainbow launcher at him.
[532.49s -> 538.25s]  Kill this mother... I can't call the pope a mother effer. That's not right. Kill this
[538.49s -> 551.13s]  bad guy. The pope. So he does a laser. He does rockets. You cannot get hit by the trail of
[551.13s -> 567.17s]  the rockets. Oh damn. Okay. I gotta go activate this one over here. Man. Just do it one right
[567.17s -> 580.29s]  after the other. See if I can... Fuck. This is starting to really irritate me. Can those
[580.29s -> 584.68s]  hit me? Hopefully... Too much stuff is going on on the screen at one time. I can't even...
[584.68s -> 598.80s]  I don't even know what's happening half the time. This rainbow colored nonsense is...
[598.80s -> 605.14s]  This is fucking ridiculous. Alright. Get it off. Get two off. He's gonna do the... There
[605.14s -> 615.26s]  we go. Laser. Three. There's the third one. Please arc over and hit him. Nice. That's
[615.26s -> 641.46s]  exactly what I needed right there. What is this? What? This might be the most swears
[641.46s -> 649.50s]  I've ever said in a video series ever. I probably have like sweared or swore like 60 times.
[649.50s -> 661.14s]  Oh, you want to like have a video where you like say swears like 75 times? Okay, great.
[661.14s -> 669.38s]  You know what? It's these... Is this like the last boss or is this like the first boss?
[669.38s -> 675.96s]  I have no idea. It's gonna be one of those things. It's either the first boss or the
[675.96s -> 683.21s]  last boss. And if this is the first boss, then my life is just gonna be over. I'm like...
[683.21s -> 689.97s]  My voice is getting all cracked up. I'm being quiet. I'm being totally silent to make this
[689.97s -> 710.86s]  happen. There we go. Please screw that up. I've been sitting here for so long trying
[710.86s -> 718.80s]  to beat this goddamn boss. Honest to God. This is just... This is just dumb. This is
[718.80s -> 727.02s]  just dumb, alright? You don't... See, I can handle this part. This part's not the big...
[727.02s -> 732.66s]  The problem. The problem is this part. Once it gets like the quad laser out, and then
[732.66s -> 736.62s]  you can't even like... You can't even do anything. Like I'm stuck in between these lasers and
[736.62s -> 748.10s]  he spins. So I'm like so screwed. And he's gonna shoot more rockets. What? Oh, he stopped.
[748.10s -> 754.86s]  He stopped doing it. Alright. I didn't... I had no idea that he did that. Don't do the
[754.86s -> 766.74s]  quad laser again, please. Is he dead? He's dead. Did I do it? Oh my God, I did it. I
[766.74s -> 776.57s]  did it. I actually did it. I'm so mad at you. Oh no. That was it? I just killed him. Okay.
[776.57s -> 782.85s]  You killed the pope. Congratulations. Dibs on his hat. Dibs on being the next pope. Dammit.
[782.85s -> 790.03s]  I wanted that. Anyway, good job. The game's not even close to being over.
