[2.04s -> 6.44s]  Hello everybody, welcome to the Christmas Eve stream.
[6.44s -> 10.02s]  I am ready to rock and roll.
[10.02s -> 14.54s]  Oh, what's up? What's up? What's up?
[14.54s -> 20.74s]  Good to see everybody again.
[20.74s -> 24.74s]  Uh, I don't... Alright, I turned on the stream I think already.
[24.74s -> 31.09s]  Now I'm Ken Haido. Welcome, welcome. How are you? Welcome to the stream. Good to see you.
[31.09s -> 36.85s]  Merry Christmas. It actually might be Christmas.
[36.85s -> 40.85s]  In some parts of the world right now. Very possible.
[40.85s -> 43.79s]  What time is it? 4.30?
[44.19s -> 48.19s]  5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. It is almost Christmas.
[49.19s -> 58.58s]  In EU?
[58.58s -> 60.58s]  Hey man, keep it down. I'm trying to sleep.
[60.58s -> 63.82s]  Wake up! It is! Oh, it's Christmas right now. Alright.
[63.82s -> 70.93s]  Yeah!
[70.93s -> 73.93s]  How was your peppermint mocha? Okay, let me... I have to explain.
[73.93s -> 75.93s]  And I'm still suffering right now, by the way.
[75.93s -> 78.68s]  So...
[78.68s -> 81.05s]  Uh...
[81.05s -> 83.80s]  I was in the Christmas spirit.
[83.80s -> 86.74s]  I was very, very excited for the holiday.
[86.74s -> 91.74s]  So, I... You know, you get flavor for a coffee. You get like one of those creamers.
[91.74s -> 96.24s]  And I got peppermint mocha flavored creamer.
[96.24s -> 98.74s]  Like, oh, this is fucking Christmas time. Let's go.
[98.74s -> 100.91s]  So, I mean...
[100.91s -> 106.29s]  I drank like three of them. Three coffees with it, in it.
[106.29s -> 109.85s]  And, uh... It was delicious, by the way.
[109.85s -> 112.54s]  Then I had to go to the bathroom.
[112.54s -> 114.78s]  And I'll be very, very honest with you.
[114.78s -> 116.78s]  I had to go to the bathroom again.
[116.78s -> 119.46s]  What?
[119.46s -> 121.46s]  We hold it for the stream because it's Christmas Eve.
[121.46s -> 123.46s]  And I... I'm holding it for Santa.
[127.43s -> 131.14s]  It's one of those things that comes in waves.
[131.14s -> 134.14s]  For those of you that understand and can get my drift.
[134.14s -> 139.37s]  I'm fine. I'm kidding. Oh, my God.
[139.37s -> 142.80s]  By the way, I have no idea what I look like.
[142.80s -> 145.98s]  Um...
[145.98s -> 147.98s]  This is gonna be a surprise to all of us, I think.
[147.98s -> 149.98s]  This is gonna be a shocker to all of us.
[149.98s -> 155.27s]  I'm just gonna look at the preview and see what I look like.
[155.27s -> 169.46s]  Ah, it's a blistery day here.
[169.46s -> 174.24s]  Father Christmas?
[174.24s -> 176.24s]  Look at how fucking much older I look.
[176.24s -> 178.24s]  And look at how wet my hair is still.
[178.24s -> 182.26s]  I haven't shaved.
[182.26s -> 184.26s]  Look at how, like, I look like it... Okay.
[184.26s -> 187.82s]  You'd probably think I got hacked if you saw the thumbnail, right?
[187.82s -> 189.82s]  If you saw this thumbnail,
[189.82s -> 193.46s]  it's like, who's this guy on Jerma's channel?
[193.46s -> 199.16s]  And why is the channel hacked?
[199.16s -> 201.46s]  It's my secret identity.
[201.46s -> 205.46s]  Yeah, this is like this bullshit disguise that...
[205.46s -> 207.46s]  Oh, yeah. I'm Superman, by the way.
[207.46s -> 210.46s]  I just put on glasses, put my hair back, and have a mustache.
[210.46s -> 214.86s]  God, I should just fucking leave halfway through the stream
[214.86s -> 218.86s]  and play a video of, like, a bus getting rescued or something.
[218.86s -> 221.61s]  Hold on to that one.
[221.61s -> 224.04s]  Imagine I'm just sitting here just playing normally.
[224.04s -> 226.71s]  I'm just like, oh, wow, look out.
[226.71s -> 228.71s]  Oh, nice, headshot.
[228.71s -> 234.58s]  And then be like, headshot.
[234.58s -> 236.58s]  Hey, guys, I gotta take a quick shit.
[236.58s -> 238.58s]  It's diarrhea, so it's gonna be, like, probably half an hour.
[238.58s -> 240.58s]  And I gotta fucking get up.
[240.58s -> 244.08s]  And then I come back, and people link me a video that,
[244.08s -> 246.08s]  oh, my God, did you see what happened?
[246.08s -> 250.26s]  And it's like me without the glasses and a superhero outfit,
[250.26s -> 252.26s]  like, saving a bus full of children,
[252.26s -> 257.96s]  dressed up like a therapist.
[257.96s -> 259.96s]  I'm not gonna... This is loud, by the way.
[259.96s -> 261.96s]  I'm not gonna wear this.
[261.96s -> 263.96s]  This is just for you to take a screenshot,
[263.96s -> 266.39s]  because I can't put these on.
[266.39s -> 268.70s]  It just seems weird.
[268.70s -> 270.70s]  I feel like I have a VR headset on without the VR in front of me,
[270.70s -> 276.58s]  because there's no lenses in these.
[276.58s -> 278.58s]  You know how some people look, like, much better with glasses?
[278.58s -> 285.94s]  What's the reverse?
[285.94s -> 295.16s]  Please wear it? I don't think I can.
[295.16s -> 297.16s]  I've got that light back up here, too,
[297.16s -> 302.41s]  which is not gonna do me any favors.
[302.41s -> 305.54s]  It's a fucking wine mom.
[305.54s -> 307.54s]  And I've got two kinds of chapstick!
[307.54s -> 311.26s]  I really am fucking 40.
[311.26s -> 317.14s]  So, here's what we're gonna do.
[317.14s -> 321.69s]  I've almost got my cross-eyed.
[321.69s -> 324.63s]  Yeah, these are coming off. I'm not fucking wearing these.
[324.63s -> 329.50s]  Those are coming off.
[329.50s -> 335.32s]  So, I have a bunch of Itch.io games that I want to play.
[335.32s -> 337.32s]  Some of them are Christmas themes,
[337.32s -> 339.32s]  some of them are horror, some of them are fun,
[339.32s -> 341.32s]  some of them are weird,
[341.32s -> 343.56s]  and we're just gonna do a bunch of them.
[343.56s -> 345.56s]  I don't know how long I'm gonna be here.
[345.56s -> 348.06s]  I don't know how long this is gonna take.
[348.06s -> 350.23s]  No idea. All I know is that I've got my wine here.
[350.23s -> 353.24s]  I've got my...oh, I'm gonna turn this on.
[353.24s -> 355.74s]  Gonna get toasty in here, I guarantee it.
[355.74s -> 361.74s]  Oh, let me move this.
[361.74s -> 364.04s]  Ah, turn on. Turn on!
[364.04s -> 367.05s]  Turn on! There we go.
[367.05s -> 371.46s]  Okay. Hold on, let me move this.
[371.46s -> 373.46s]  Let me move that.
[373.46s -> 375.94s]  Move this. Let me move that.
[375.94s -> 377.94s]  Move this.
[377.94s -> 379.94s]  I've got, like, an empty coffee mug here I want to get rid of as well.
[379.94s -> 381.94s]  All right.
[381.94s -> 386.74s]  I think I'm ready.
[386.74s -> 388.74s]  You just turned off the PC.
[388.74s -> 392.65s]  Hey, you know, hold on. I think I have to...
[392.65s -> 394.65s]  I think I have to be right back for a minute.
[394.65s -> 397.72s]  Yeah. Yeah, I think I got...
[397.72s -> 399.72s]  Yeah, I gotta BRB for just a second, guys.
[399.72s -> 406.10s]  Yeah, BRB.
[406.10s -> 408.10s]  Just one second. Just a minute or two.
[408.10s -> 419.48s]  Hahahaha! Merry Christmas!
[419.48s -> 426.58s]  Did you get one? Did you get your present?
[426.58s -> 429.53s]  I'm trying to make it around the clock.
[429.53s -> 438.94s]  I'm trying to get there.
[438.94s -> 440.94s]  There it is. I told you we were going to get one for winter
[440.94s -> 442.94s]  and one for Christmas.
[442.94s -> 445.37s]  Just in time for the holiday.
[445.37s -> 448.06s]  Got one of our new BRB screens
[448.06s -> 456.57s]  and I love it.
[456.57s -> 458.57s]  We're going to use this for, like, at least a week or two.
[458.57s -> 463.05s]  I don't even care if it's Christmas is over.
[463.05s -> 471.03s]  Do you see the characters in the background?
[471.03s -> 473.03s]  Can you count? Is that Grandpa? That is Grandpa down there.
[473.03s -> 478.86s]  Yeah, Blordow made this.
[478.86s -> 480.86s]  Got it done.
[480.86s -> 483.80s]  And out and ready.
[483.80s -> 485.80s]  We're just in time here.
[485.80s -> 488.42s]  So that's going to be the BRB screen
[488.42s -> 491.05s]  that you will see from now on
[491.05s -> 497.77s]  for the next week or two.
[497.77s -> 499.77s]  And now, we can actually start the stream.
[499.77s -> 502.20s]  I wanted to show that, though. I thought it was really cool.
[502.20s -> 506.30s]  Now, don't mind, like, the scary music
[506.30s -> 509.62s]  that's here now.
[509.62s -> 511.62s]  We're playing a scary game. It's called Santa's Cookies.
[511.62s -> 513.62s]  It's the first of the Ichio Night.
[513.62s -> 517.83s]  And I think we can begin.
[517.83s -> 524.68s]  I think we can begin.
[524.68s -> 526.68s]  That's a pretty good...
[526.68s -> 530.63s]  What year is it? What year is this?
[530.63s -> 535.43s]  Uh, last week.
[535.43s -> 537.99s]  2022.
[537.99s -> 540.30s]  Whatever it is.
[540.30s -> 542.98s]  It's a vintage!
[542.98s -> 545.48s]  I got it a week ago!
[545.48s -> 547.48s]  Evil hair. I look evil today. Are you ready?
[547.48s -> 549.48s]  Oh, but we want you to play horror games.
[549.48s -> 551.48s]  All right, well, the only time I'm going to play horror games right now
[551.48s -> 553.48s]  is if a lot of community subs are coming in, too.
[553.48s -> 555.48s]  Holy shit, thank you, everybody.
[555.48s -> 557.48s]  That's way too much.
[557.48s -> 559.72s]  Don't give me... Stop giving me money.
[559.72s -> 561.72s]  I demand it. That's 100 community subs from Zixia.
[561.72s -> 563.72s]  Merry Christmas. Stop giving me money.
[563.72s -> 566.22s]  Don't give me any more. I'm going to be very upset with you.
[566.22s -> 568.52s]  I'm going to be very upset with you.
[568.52s -> 570.82s]  Don't give me any more money. I'll be very upset with you.
[570.82s -> 573.38s]  Is this thing in the right spot?
[573.38s -> 576.07s]  What's it look like without this? I don't know.
[576.07s -> 579.53s]  All right, here we go.
[579.53s -> 581.53s]  Are you guys ready to rock and roll for the Christmas Eve extravaganza Ichio extravaganza Wine Mom Night?
[581.53s -> 594.97s]  Let me drop this.
[594.97s -> 602.20s]  Should I do two headphones for this?
[602.20s -> 604.20s]  I think my face cam's too big.
[604.20s -> 610.46s]  Yeah, I was right.
[610.46s -> 612.46s]  Uh, Zixia, that's insane. 100 community subs.
[612.46s -> 614.46s]  So many community subs are coming in.
[614.46s -> 616.46s]  Don't give me any more money. Thank you.
[616.46s -> 618.46s]  But that's a huge amount. 20 from Animos.
[618.46s -> 620.95s]  40 from Animos.
[620.95s -> 623.13s]  Let's fucking go. Santa's Cookies.
[623.13s -> 629.46s]  Ready to rock and roll.
[629.46s -> 641.56s]  Turn it up. The game crashed.
[641.56s -> 643.56s]  Shit. That's my fault.
[643.56s -> 649.58s]  That's my fault. I fucked it up.
[649.58s -> 651.58s]  I'm ready for this one, though. I fucked it up. Hold on.
[651.58s -> 663.72s]  Try it again.
[663.72s -> 666.60s]  Okay. Santa's Cookies.
[666.60s -> 677.27s]  Here we go. Merry Christmas, everybody.
[677.27s -> 679.27s]  Oh!
[679.27s -> 681.27s]  That's right. Voting for New Year's Eve.
[681.27s -> 683.27s]  Die!
[683.27s -> 689.29s]  Wait, what was he?
[689.29s -> 691.29s]  Get me! I didn't do anything.
[691.29s -> 695.45s]  What happened?
[695.45s -> 698.33s]  Um, voting for New Year's Eve.
[698.33s -> 700.82s]  I was...
[700.82s -> 702.82s]  Dude, the OBS preview is over here
[702.82s -> 704.82s]  and I got jumpscared from it.
[704.82s -> 707.51s]  Um, okay.
[707.51s -> 709.69s]  New Year's Eve stuff.
[709.69s -> 711.69s]  The poll, the vote,
[711.69s -> 713.69s]  is almost ready.
[713.69s -> 715.69s]  It's gonna take a little bit longer.
[715.69s -> 717.69s]  I'm hoping
[717.69s -> 719.69s]  that after this stream is over,
[719.69s -> 721.69s]  later tonight, you will see on my Twitter,
[721.69s -> 723.69s]  boom, Survey Monkey. There it is.
[723.69s -> 725.69s]  If it's not there tonight,
[725.69s -> 728.25s]  and that'll be an early Christmas present
[728.25s -> 730.25s]  for you tomorrow morning.
[730.25s -> 732.25s]  So, it's going to be there within the next
[732.25s -> 734.94s]  12 hours. Guaranteed.
[734.94s -> 739.03s]  People still giving a ton of money?
[739.03s -> 741.03s]  Alright.
[741.03s -> 743.03s]  Stop giving me money. I'm serious.
[743.03s -> 745.66s]  Stop giving me money. Please stop giving me money.
[745.66s -> 747.66s]  Don't give me any more money.
[747.66s -> 749.66s]  I'm addressing you directly now.
[749.66s -> 751.66s]  Don't give me any more money. I don't want it.
[751.66s -> 754.86s]  Stop it. Alright. No, no, no.
[754.86s -> 756.86s]  I haven't drank this yet. Alright, let's go.
[756.86s -> 759.86s]  So, what happened?
[759.86s -> 762.87s]  So, I don't want to meet Santa.
[762.87s -> 770.28s]  Why do you open doors? What?
[770.28s -> 778.02s]  Who am I? Why am I this small?
[778.02s -> 786.28s]  Is he right outside?
[786.28s -> 796.78s]  What am I supposed to goal?
[796.78s -> 809.32s]  Okay. I don't see him.
[809.32s -> 813.10s]  What am I supposed to be doing?
[813.10s -> 815.40s]  Oh, I got milk.
[815.40s -> 821.16s]  Oh no, I don't have a glass. I think I have to fill this with milk.
[821.16s -> 823.16s]  Can I just put it in the sink?
[823.16s -> 825.16s]  It's your fucking mom and dad anyways. Who cares?
[825.16s -> 827.98s]  I'll just put it in the sink.
[827.98s -> 847.74s]  Can I hide in here?
[847.74s -> 849.74s]  Why did I get jumped on so quickly last time?
[849.74s -> 852.74s]  Where's our house?
[852.74s -> 863.94s]  Oh shit, there he is.
[863.94s -> 867.21s]  Where's his hat? Oh shit, close the door.
[867.21s -> 869.64s]  Where do I go? What should I do?
[869.64s -> 871.64s]  This is not even Santa. This is just dad walking around.
[871.64s -> 879.38s]  Where's his hat?
[879.38s -> 883.02s]  I'd wear.
[883.02s -> 910.71s]  Can I go under the bed? There's a sprint.
[910.71s -> 914.17s]  I don't see him down here. Oh, milk.
[914.17s -> 921.40s]  Residents, hold on. There's milk, milk, milk, milk.
[921.40s -> 927.85s]  Put it down.
[927.85s -> 929.85s]  Alright, I got the milk on the table. Oh my fucking god, there he is.
[929.85s -> 936.30s]  Where do I go? Where do I go?
[936.30s -> 939.24s]  He's going back up the stairs. I think I'm okay.
[939.24s -> 947.62s]  So I have to put the cookies up there too?
[947.62s -> 958.38s]  Oh, there's a cookie. Oh shit, I think I missed.
[958.38s -> 972.01s]  I hope Santa didn't have any
[972.01s -> 974.01s]  pep and mocha coffees this morning like me.
[974.01s -> 984.38s]  I think I'm alright.
[984.38s -> 986.38s]  I think I probably leave now.
[986.38s -> 1007.48s]  It plays the music when he's there.
[1007.48s -> 1009.48s]  Where are the other cookies?
[1009.48s -> 1011.48s]  Relax, holy shit, dude. Are you kidding me?
[1011.48s -> 1014.36s]  This is not even scary.
[1014.36s -> 1016.36s]  Did I just fake that? No, I really didn't. I swear to god.
[1016.36s -> 1018.36s]  But that was way over- I haven't played scary games in a long time.
[1018.36s -> 1022.78s]  It's been a very long time.
[1022.78s -> 1024.78s]  That was way over-acting.
[1024.78s -> 1027.27s]  I gotta go back to acting school.
[1027.27s -> 1029.27s]  You guys think it's gonna be funny that in 10 years
[1029.27s -> 1031.27s]  when actors
[1031.27s -> 1033.27s]  don't even want to be actors anymore, they just want to be streamers?
[1033.27s -> 1035.96s]  There will be workshops
[1035.96s -> 1037.96s]  on how to react to
[1037.96s -> 1042.70s]  a jump scare.
[1042.70s -> 1049.54s]  I could teach that class. Alright, that was Santa's cookies.
[1049.54s -> 1054.65s]  It was pretty good.
[1054.65s -> 1056.65s]  We're gonna stay in this same realm
[1056.65s -> 1058.65s]  I think. We might as well
[1058.65s -> 1061.08s]  get them out of the way.
[1061.08s -> 1063.08s]  This one's called The Christmas Incident.
[1063.08s -> 1074.97s]  Find out.
[1074.97s -> 1076.97s]  Return of Scare Saturdays? Well, I mean, I just
[1076.97s -> 1079.59s]  feel like it'd be fun.
[1079.59s -> 1081.59s]  Christmas Incident. This one looks weird.
[1081.59s -> 1085.37s]  All these games were got on
[1085.37s -> 1089.21s]  ICHIO, by the way.
[1089.21s -> 1099.45s]  I think I'm gonna have to capture my monitor.
[1099.45s -> 1108.39s]  Alright, this is called The Christmas Incident.
[1108.39s -> 1110.39s]  I'm gonna turn this way fucking down.
[1110.39s -> 1112.39s]  Alright, 20 should be alright. Play.
[1112.39s -> 1120.25s]  Turn it up. Have you met Santa?
[1120.25s -> 1124.86s]  Okay, we gotta-
[1124.86s -> 1126.86s]  Can I get the sensitivity menu back?
[1126.86s -> 1131.85s]  This is way too low.
[1131.85s -> 1133.85s]  Every game has
[1133.85s -> 1135.85s]  wicked shit sensitivity, though.
[1135.85s -> 1138.22s]  Hold on, I gotta fix this. This is not gonna happen
[1138.22s -> 1140.78s]  the way that it is right now. Looking for a game
[1140.78s -> 1142.78s]  to capture. Well, there isn't one, so just wait.
[1142.78s -> 1153.64s]  Fucking didn't even
[1153.64s -> 1155.64s]  do the sensitivity, goddammit!
[1155.64s -> 1161.14s]  Every game that's ever released
[1161.14s -> 1164.34s]  ever, always
[1164.34s -> 1166.34s]  have the mouse sensitivity
[1166.34s -> 1168.34s]  you have to do 0
[1168.34s -> 1170.34s]  to 10 or nothing at all.
[1170.34s -> 1172.34s]  Like, anything over 10 is
[1172.34s -> 1175.16s]  unusable. I'll get it this time.
[1175.16s -> 1181.35s]  Call it. I'm gonna keep it at
[1181.35s -> 1185.13s]  50. Christmas- The Christmas
[1185.13s -> 1187.13s]  Miracle. That's better. Alright.
[1187.13s -> 1189.13s]  Can we give like an actual clap to this
[1189.13s -> 1191.82s]  dev, whoever you are?
[1191.82s -> 1193.82s]  You are better than every single AAA
[1193.82s -> 1195.82s]  studio that makes mouse
[1195.82s -> 1199.53s]  sensitivity awful. Alright, so let's go.
[1199.53s -> 1207.02s]  This is kinda creepy. Both
[1207.02s -> 1209.32s]  headphones in, I know I'm cheating. Have you
[1209.32s -> 1212.71s]  met Santa? Yeah, I've met him.
[1212.71s -> 1225.94s]  Maybe once or twice.
[1225.94s -> 1231.64s]  Pick up the flashlight. Okay.
[1231.64s -> 1237.06s]  There's no FOV slider.
[1237.06s -> 1240.01s]  What the hell is going on? You hear that?
[1240.01s -> 1249.67s]  It's creepy. Okay, I got a
[1249.67s -> 1251.67s]  game coming up that I'm really not looking forward to playing.
[1251.67s -> 1254.10s]  There's a game that I'm gonna play
[1254.10s -> 1256.28s]  in a little bit that is
[1256.28s -> 1258.28s]  considered one of the scariest, most
[1258.28s -> 1260.28s]  unbearable Itch.io experiences.
[1260.28s -> 1262.28s]  It's by that Puppet, um
[1262.28s -> 1265.29s]  Puppet combo?
[1265.29s -> 1267.46s]  It looks so
[1267.46s -> 1269.64s]  ugh. I'm not
[1269.64s -> 1271.64s]  fucking ready. It looks so horrible.
[1271.64s -> 1273.64s]  I don't know if I wanna do it.
[1273.64s -> 1277.29s]  But this low poly shit is way
[1277.29s -> 1279.29s]  scarier than like a hundred
[1279.29s -> 1281.29s]  zombies running at you in Resident Evil.
[1281.29s -> 1283.29s]  They gotta go back to this stuff. They really do.
[1283.29s -> 1288.79s]  It's just so unsettling. Enter house,
[1288.79s -> 1299.27s]  press E. Hold on.
[1299.27s -> 1301.27s]  It like looks like 3D movie maker, which makes it
[1301.27s -> 1307.99s]  worse. What am I looking for?
[1307.99s -> 1322.26s]  Just investigate? There are people talking.
[1322.26s -> 1326.86s]  Can you hear them? There are people eating
[1326.86s -> 1332.04s]  dinner. Where are the people?
[1332.04s -> 1342.47s]  What radio station just plays the
[1342.47s -> 1344.47s]  inside of a restaurant on a Thursday night?
[1344.47s -> 1363.45s]  I don't know. Okay.
[1363.45s -> 1367.54s]  BP. Can I turn the flashlight off?
[1367.54s -> 1386.02s]  Nothing in here. Oh, there is something in here.
[1386.02s -> 1401.96s]  There's a bloody knife. Now over here?
[1401.96s -> 1405.66s]  Wait. Yeah. This is where I came in.
[1405.66s -> 1407.66s]  Do I need to pick up any candy? Is this an elevator?
[1407.66s -> 1409.66s]  Why would you have it? Why is there an elevator?
[1409.66s -> 1423.16s]  Are you painting on the toilet? Oh, I thought that was
[1423.16s -> 1425.16s]  an easel. I was like
[1425.16s -> 1427.16s]  doing like a fucking piece of artwork while he
[1427.16s -> 1431.45s]  was taking a shit. Why is there
[1431.45s -> 1438.04s]  a mirror in here?
[1438.04s -> 1440.04s]  That's so weird. Can you
[1440.04s -> 1442.04s]  imagine just like squatting down here and
[1442.04s -> 1444.22s]  just like on your phone and just going
[1444.22s -> 1448.63s]  like this? That would be so
[1448.63s -> 1459.51s]  weird looking. What do you mean squatting?
[1459.51s -> 1462.65s]  How do you go to the bathroom?
[1462.65s -> 1465.59s]  What are you talking about? You squat down to take
[1465.59s -> 1467.96s]  a shit. How do you go to the bathroom? What are you talking about?
[1467.96s -> 1471.10s]  You stand on the toilet seat?
[1471.10s -> 1473.98s]  Sit. Yeah, squat, sit.
[1473.98s -> 1475.98s]  Like, you'd be
[1475.98s -> 1477.98s]  like, you know what I mean? Squat.
[1477.98s -> 1480.41s]  Take half a squat. What happened to my pop
[1480.41s -> 1483.22s]  stand? What the fuck is going on? You squat.
[1483.22s -> 1496.92s]  That looks fucking weird.
[1496.92s -> 1506.07s]  I'm not going to drink that way. Do I have
[1506.07s -> 1511.38s]  any backstory here? It's a horror
[1511.38s -> 1513.38s]  game, guys. Where's the notes that are
[1513.38s -> 1515.38s]  everywhere with like three pages of exposition?
[1515.38s -> 1519.74s]  Where's the open diary
[1519.74s -> 1521.74s]  with like fucking four pages of what happened
[1521.74s -> 1525.06s]  yesterday? This is what? You think this is a horror
[1525.06s -> 1529.03s]  game? Ooh, a big key.
[1529.03s -> 1537.98s]  I like this. I
[1537.98s -> 1540.47s]  love, I don't know. I think it's so cool
[1540.47s -> 1542.90s]  that over the last like ten years or so
[1542.90s -> 1544.90s]  that we've been able to have indie devs have been able
[1544.90s -> 1547.46s]  to just make whatever the fuck they want. It's really cool.
[1547.46s -> 1553.74s]  Is there a sprint? There is not a sprint.
[1553.74s -> 1561.16s]  I got a key though. Was there a locked door?
[1561.16s -> 1572.79s]  Oh shit. Oh,
[1572.79s -> 1574.79s]  there is a present waiting for you
[1574.79s -> 1582.28s]  under the Christmas tree. Is that Iron
[1582.28s -> 1585.03s]  Maiden? Why are they just like the
[1585.03s -> 1587.03s]  Olympic fucking rings? What?
[1587.03s -> 1590.86s]  What are these? There's a present waiting for you
[1590.86s -> 1592.86s]  under the tree. Alright, there's a person lying here.
[1592.86s -> 1617.35s]  Okay. I'm like unsettled right
[1617.35s -> 1619.35s]  now. Go get the present.
[1619.35s -> 1632.09s]  That's the wrong way. Oh shit. Okay, I thought
[1632.09s -> 1637.66s]  that was a hallway that went this way. It'd be so
[1637.66s -> 1639.66s]  funny to the killer. Like to the killer though.
[1639.66s -> 1641.66s]  Like you run that way
[1641.66s -> 1643.66s]  and you stop and you go, oops, sorry, nevermind.
[1643.66s -> 1648.89s]  What am I supposed to do?
[1648.89s -> 1656.74s]  Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me,
[1656.74s -> 1658.74s]  me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
[1658.74s -> 1665.83s]  Mokaish! Tree's downstairs.
[1665.83s -> 1683.99s]  Isn't the tree over here?
[1683.99s -> 1685.99s]  Alright, he's not just hiding back there, right?
[1685.99s -> 1691.43s]  Go get your present under the tree.
[1691.43s -> 1693.43s]  He's gonna just grab me and scream in my face.
[1693.43s -> 1696.06s]  I know it. Where's my present?
[1696.06s -> 1701.94s]  You forgot to put your eyelashes on.
[1701.94s -> 1714.28s]  Oh, I forgot something.
[1714.28s -> 1730.33s]  Is he running? Stop making
[1730.33s -> 1732.33s]  the fucking noise. Where is he?
[1732.33s -> 1744.15s]  The front door? Is he upstairs?
[1744.15s -> 1775.94s]  This is different. Oh, no.
[1775.94s -> 1788.86s]  I'm gonna get lost. I'm gonna get lost in here. Does that sound startle the witch?
[1788.86s -> 1791.22s]  Oh, I don't like- I hate this shit so much.
[1791.22s -> 1802.67s]  Why do I- like, you know, can I tell you something?
[1802.67s -> 1805.39s]  I need to talk about this for a sec before I get scared.
[1805.39s -> 1807.98s]  What the fuck is wrong with humans?
[1807.98s -> 1814.19s]  The lengths we go to to entertain ourselves and like stimulate our brains.
[1814.19s -> 1818.24s]  What the hell am I doing here? Why are we doing this?
[1820.53s -> 1827.86s]  Humanity goes so far to desperately try to stimulate our brains to a point where we like pretend
[1828.02s -> 1832.64s]  we're locked in a murderer's house and there's blood everywhere and we're gonna get fucking killed.
[1833.12s -> 1842.92s]  Guys, even just the notion of the firework is enough to be like, what are we doing?
[1842.92s -> 1847.00s]  Oh, yeah, I mean, I got an idea. Let's just make explode stuff.
[1847.00s -> 1854.95s]  Like, just make huge explosions in front of everybody. Like, why? Why are we doing this? You're high already.
[1867.33s -> 1874.59s]  What happened? What the fuck was that? I didn't do that. Why did my light just do that?
[1874.75s -> 1877.87s]  Why did the lights just go out? I'm not- am I- look at my hands.
[1878.23s -> 1881.91s]  Why did the lights just turn off? Why did the lights just turn off?
[1896.79s -> 1901.50s]  That was scarier than the game. Is the house haunted?
[1903.51s -> 1907.19s]  Did somebody hack my computer and like hack my house and turn my lights off in my house?
[1907.75s -> 1917.13s]  I feel like that was somebody here. 32-bit holiday jam 2021. Good work. That was fun.
[1917.13s -> 1929.82s]  Special thanks to the Unity Asset Store. Good shit. That was fun. It's quick. It was fun. It was weird.
[1929.82s -> 1938.31s]  I like it. It was good. Christmas incident. I love the low poly. I think it's fantastic.
[1938.83s -> 1944.80s]  You look genuinely concerned. Bro, the lights just turned off in my room and I didn't fucking
[1944.80s -> 1949.97s]  click switch. That wasn't a routine. I didn't- that wasn't a bit I did.
[1950.53s -> 1956.51s]  Alright, let's keep going. Moving on. I think there's one more like this that I want to do.
[1957.07s -> 1965.68s]  We've got- okay, I gotta make sure I remember which ones we did. That was the Christmas incident.
[1966.61s -> 1974.98s]  We did Santa's cookies. The next one coming up is sleigh bells. Sleigh bells.
[1974.98s -> 1994.29s]  Hopefully it's not loud. Careful. Stop breaking my immersion OBS.
[1997.93s -> 2009.55s]  Another low poly one we got here. Sleigh bells. Why is everyone saying yes? Why am I wearing- what
[2009.55s -> 2021.71s]  did you say? Why are you wearing a 2013 turkey evil eye bath towel? That's so weirdly specific.
[2021.71s -> 2026.90s]  I have no idea what you're even talking about. It's a nice sweater. I think it looks good.
[2027.46s -> 2031.82s]  It's not an ugly Christmas sweater. This is a beautiful Christmas sweater.
[2033.34s -> 2057.54s]  And I've got the game. I've got the game on. Yes, sleigh. You did this. Merry Christmas everybody.
[2058.62s -> 2062.83s]  You know, it's been kind of a fucked up year or two. It's been kind of stressful for everybody,
[2062.83s -> 2073.18s]  I think. But, uh, let's hope we- we keep going. All we can do is move forward. And that's it. Okay.
[2076.53s -> 2084.94s]  I'm ready. Press any key. You got it. Click here to watch the making of this game. Sleigh bells.
[2084.94s -> 2095.73s]  Who made this game? By Blake McKinnon. Additional sound effects by Brianna McKinnon.
[2095.73s -> 2101.52s]  Move WASD, sprint to shift, attack. There's an attack. Left click, zoom, right click,
[2101.52s -> 2109.66s]  F, E, and Q. All right, let's go. Christmas Eve and I'm still taking my clothes off in this
[2109.66s -> 2114.96s]  horrible town for money. Sigh, I better deliver Billy's Christmas present before it gets too late.
[2114.96s -> 2120.72s]  I wonder if he even remembers what I look like. He hasn't seen me for months. Not since he went
[2120.72s -> 2131.71s]  to live with his father. Why'd they have to take him from me? I miss my little Billy. Okay. Toggle
[2131.71s -> 2152.50s]  your flashlight. I like the music. I'm gonna go this way. There's a stamina meter. You know when
[2152.50s -> 2159.12s]  you put lip balm on and then your skin starts peeling off on your lips? What's up with that?
[2159.12s -> 2170.19s]  Our objective. Deliver Billy's present. This is zoom. Okay. I thought they were just gonna
[2170.19s -> 2176.00s]  fucking crash. Oh, I was gonna get, I didn't get it because it was, the file was so huge
[2176.00s -> 2183.50s]  for like a two second joke. I was gonna hit gone home, but you're a car. It was making me laugh.
[2184.54s -> 2202.38s]  I like this. But imagine if I played that. Okay. Are you Billy? Where's Billy? Where's my house?
[2202.94s -> 2219.02s]  Who are these people? Oh, snowman. That's a pretty damn good snowman. I gotta tell you.
[2219.10s -> 2225.07s]  The hair in my wine. Okay. I almost drank it. I don't care. It doesn't matter. You guys know
[2225.07s -> 2233.76s]  you eat over an inch of dirt every single meal. You know that? You eat over an inch of dirt every
[2233.76s -> 2244.88s]  single meal. Weird. Every time you've ever eaten, you're always eating over an inch of dirt because
[2244.88s -> 2251.28s]  you're at least about a foot off the ground at the dinner table, aren't you? Use that joke at
[2251.28s -> 2256.74s]  Christmas. Your family will laugh. I guarantee it. You're always eating at least an inch over
[2257.38s -> 2262.88s]  of dirt, at least. You know what I mean? At least you eat over an inch of dirt means you at least
[2262.88s -> 2272.42s]  eat over the inch of dirt. Get it? You guys don't get it. Or bet somebody to bar a hundred dollars
[2272.42s -> 2284.22s]  at. You'll win. Oh, deliver. I think this is it. Okay. I'll just leave the present here. I doubt
[2284.22s -> 2287.90s]  they'll want to see me right now. I better get home or it gets too late. I don't want to be out
[2287.90s -> 2302.62s]  after midnight. You minus twoing that? I just made everybody here a hundred dollars. You're not gonna
[2302.62s -> 2305.58s]  minus two when somebody has to pay you a hundred dollars because you proved to them that you eat
[2305.58s -> 2321.46s]  over an inch of dirt every meal. People fucking money. Whatever. Fine. All right. Merry Christmas,
[2321.46s -> 2335.76s]  Billy. I better get home. Chat is pissed. They'll get over it. I've made worse jokes. If you're new
[2335.76s -> 2346.72s]  here, don't worry. In fact, eventually here over the next 12 hours or so, you'll be able to vote
[2346.72s -> 2355.63s]  for what your favorite worst joke was last year. You've been on my Twitter. Worst joke of the year
[2355.63s -> 2379.30s]  is a category. Do I have an objective on the map? Make your way home. Okay. Where do I live? Where
[2379.30s -> 2398.40s]  do I live? What if I don't know where I live? Subway. This is blocked off for some reason.
[2398.40s -> 2406.35s]  I wonder what's going on up here. I won't be getting home this way. I'll have to go through
[2406.35s -> 2420.08s]  the subway tunnel. It's not that much further. I'm going to get fucked up today, by the way.
[2420.08s -> 2441.70s]  Just want to make sure everyone knows. All right. Go through the subway. Easy. All right. Here we go.
[2441.70s -> 2447.87s]  I got to go home through the subway. I got to walk the whole subway train line thing. It's allowed
[2447.87s -> 2466.86s]  to, is it all right? Aunt Sausage. Cat and the Mouse Experiment. Blake McKinnon film. Is this
[2466.86s -> 2475.57s]  guy, is this guy made like a horror movie? All right, Blake, let's see what you got. Let's see
[2475.57s -> 2488.11s]  what you got. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you too. I just licked my lips because I'm a lip
[2488.11s -> 2492.43s]  licker. I just can't stop. And I just tasted soap because I've been putting, I'm trying to do this,
[2492.43s -> 2503.49s]  man. I just, I gotta stop doing it. I'm such a, I'm a lizard. I swear to God. I, I'm so aware of it
[2503.49s -> 2512.45s]  too. It sucks. He's been disemboweled. What sort of maniac would do such a thing? I better get out
[2512.45s -> 2522.14s]  of here before whoever did this comes back. Get out of the subway? Oh, there's a lot of ads for
[2522.14s -> 2530.91s]  this guy's movie. There are more ads for this guy's YouTube horror movie than Spider-Man No Way Home.
[2530.91s -> 2538.80s]  Advertiser budget is probably pretty high for this one. It's loud as fuck. Is it all right?
[2538.80s -> 2556.62s]  Where should I go? Wait. I don't think I should go that way. Why is that even scary? Like, I mean,
[2556.62s -> 2564.98s]  it's weird that there's a, but like if I saw Santa, I'd be like, oh, safe. Santa will protect me from
[2564.98s -> 2577.79s]  the fucking scary monster that's here. I wouldn't be scared of Santa. All right. Do I have to run?
[2577.79s -> 2589.46s]  Why the fuck did you get over there? What happened? What are you talking about?
[2589.46s -> 2603.62s]  What? I wouldn't be scared of Santa. I would hope Santa would be the one protecting us.
[2603.62s -> 2610.48s]  If Santa's the one with the axe, we've got a lot of problems. We've got way more problems than we
[2610.48s -> 2641.22s]  think. Okay. So what am I supposed to do? Just run away? So what the fuck, man? Do I go buy him?
[2641.22s -> 2661.38s]  Oh shit. It's always a bathroom punch. What if I just punch him in the face?
[2661.38s -> 2666.54s]  I'm tell- I honestly think this. If like an old man was coming at me with a big axe,
[2666.54s -> 2672.13s]  I would just snap his neck and win. They have to swing the- an axe is not a great weapon.
[2673.33s -> 2688.11s]  All right. I'm dead. I don't think I wouldn't be afraid of an axe. I really wouldn't. An axe has
[2688.11s -> 2691.79s]  this like one point. It's heavy. You have to swing it. I would be able to dodge it and I would just
[2691.79s -> 2696.75s]  go dodge underneath them and grab him by his chin here and his top of his head here. And I would
[2697.47s -> 2709.71s]  snap his neck. It would be easy. Axes are not good weapons. Seriously. So, okay. I got to follow the
[2709.71s -> 2722.10s]  arrow somebody said. What the fuck? Ah, see what I'm talking about? This guy can't even hit me.
[2722.10s -> 2748.06s]  Don't turn around. Don't turn around. Don't turn around. Get out of the subway. Get out of the
[2748.06s -> 2776.86s]  subway. Get out of the subway. Whoa. Holy shit. Look at that. Whoa. What the fuck? That's so cool.
[2776.86s -> 2786.14s]  I didn't know you could do that. I need a crowbar to get out of the subway. Where the fuck is the
[2786.14s -> 2817.41s]  crowbar? I need a crowbar to get out of the subway. Bathroom? I knew you were gonna go right.
[2817.41s -> 2829.58s]  Where is the crowbar? It has to be the bathroom. Oh, down here? What the fuck? He's killing
[2829.58s -> 2851.87s]  policemen. Crowbar? I don't see a crowbar. Oh, fuck it. Out of here, dude. Where is the crowbar?
[2851.87s -> 2863.46s]  Can I hide? I have no idea where I am right now. I'm just going in circles. He's on the map. No,
[2863.46s -> 2888.91s]  he's not. What the hell is going on? Crowbar? Crowbar? Crowbar? You! How do I get the fuck out
[2888.91s -> 2899.14s]  of here? Oh my god, dude. Give me a break. Come on. I don't even know where I- I don't even know
[2899.14s -> 2925.23s]  where that was. Is there a crouch? I gotta hop. Okay, I gotta go right? I don't want him to see me.
[2925.23s -> 2932.70s]  Don't- okay. He'll walk by and I can go around. I'm high as fuck right now. As long as that's
[2932.70s -> 2942.27s]  legal in your jurisdiction and you're responsible about it and I'm okay with it. This is too loud.
[2942.27s -> 2954.00s]  I'm turning it down. Fuck it. If I can go around and hide. You- oh, yeah. Pre-fire.
[2954.56s -> 2963.26s]  Ban this person from the lobby, seriously. Oh, you piece of shit. Give me a break.
[2963.26s -> 2970.82s]  I remember it's down here. I gotta- okay. Lock this in long-term memory, please, Jeremy.
[2970.82s -> 2983.26s]  Here, I see blood. It's literally right. No, it's left. You stupid motherfucker.
[2983.26s -> 3002.26s]  I'm gonna get through this. It's the stamina that's killing me. It's right. So you go right,
[3002.26s -> 3005.97s]  straight. Alright, I'll get it. And then I gotta get to the exit, too.
[3007.17s -> 3035.66s]  The flashlight? I'm gonna flash that off. Okay, down, right. He doesn't know where I am. Right?
[3035.66s -> 3051.42s]  I don't know where I am. Where am I? Ah! Okay, I don't- I forget everything.
[3051.42s -> 3072.37s]  Fuck you! Give me a break. What? Right here? Where am I supposed to go?
[3072.37s -> 3084.32s]  And then I gotta go down here and leave the subway. Don't turn- I'm not gonna turn around.
[3084.32s -> 3101.18s]  No way. This looks like a Roblox mod. It's low poly. Just give me a checkpoint, please.
[3101.18s -> 3109.20s]  Oh shit, my light. My light- hold on a second. Whoa! I can't- if the game's paused,
[3109.20s -> 3133.73s]  he can't hurt me, right? My light's fucked up. I'm trying to be professional for once in my god
[3133.73s -> 3156.77s]  damn life. Alright, now what? Find your way home. It's very quiet all of a sudden. I wonder where
[3156.77s -> 3192.13s]  everyone has gone. A gulp. The weather outside is bright. I got fire and solar light. Since we-
[3192.13s -> 3202.85s]  since we no place- hold on. Since we no place- I'll get it. Since we no place to go. Let it snow,
[3202.85s -> 3214.62s]  let it snow, let it snow. Use that part. Like, three people just got banned. I don't know what
[3214.62s -> 3237.44s]  you did, but what the fuck are you doing? Oh, why do they have to keep locking this gate? Oh,
[3237.44s -> 3242.86s]  that's not Santa talking. I thought it said Santa. Looks like damage- can I break it?
[3242.86s -> 3255.12s]  How would you not be able to break it with a crowbar? Why could you not break it with a crowbar?
[3255.12s -> 3259.20s]  I don't even have a crowbar anymore. Why the game take- the game took the crowbar from me.
[3259.20s -> 3274.42s]  Are you kidding me? The flashlight. It coughs. There's a crazy guy running around with an axe.
[3274.42s -> 3279.98s]  He's- but he's- I think he's literally 15 feet behind me. He's gonna kill me.
[3283.76s -> 3292.59s]  Oh, I should go file a police report. He's- he's literally fucking 30 feet behind me. He's even
[3292.59s -> 3300.18s]  an axe. He's gonna kill me. Go- go to the station tomorrow morning. Okay. Just to tomorrow morning?
[3300.18s -> 3315.92s]  Okay. Okay, thank- all right, thank you. So, I need to find a weapon.
[3315.92s -> 3333.84s]  Politic Landy. I'm well lit for that one. Fuck you. I need to find something that breaks this.
[3333.84s -> 3344.21s]  Can I just punch it with my hands? How am I supposed to find something that breaks through
[3344.21s -> 3356.74s]  a wall? I had a crowbar in my freaking hand. Go home. What do you think I'm trying to do?
[3356.74s -> 3365.57s]  And how dare you talk like that to the streamer? Number one rule is respect the streamer always.
[3365.57s -> 3373.87s]  How dare you? I- I don't want to activate this yet. There's gotta be like a weapon or something
[3373.87s -> 3378.90s]  I can find. Something to break the door. I don't want to turn that cutscene on because then he
[3378.90s -> 3389.20s]  starts chasing after me. Hold on. Uh, it might show up on the minimap. Can I write your obituary in
[3389.20s -> 3397.14s]  advance? Ban that person for an hour. I think I have to do this first. Okay, now it's like,
[3397.14s -> 3410.42s]  oh, I can't get through here. Where is he? Where is he then? All right, does it- is it gonna show
[3410.42s -> 3423.36s]  up in the minimap? Something I can break? He just fucking hit me in the back. Oh, I'm so dead.
[3426.82s -> 3435.20s]  All right, I gotta find this, whatever this is first. Find something to break the door down,
[3435.20s -> 3441.84s]  but I wait, I don't know where to look. Blue dot on the map? It was only a yellow dot on the map,
[3441.84s -> 3463.81s]  though. I looked. Sneak around if- okay, turn the flashlight off. What can I find here? Go through
[3463.81s -> 3472.48s]  the window? Yeah, I'm not activating his spawn point here. Not yet. What about can I jump up on
[3472.48s -> 3482.98s]  stuff? Go through the window. You saw a window? It was a blue one just as you died. Really, was
[3482.98s -> 3487.89s]  there? All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, I'm going, I'm going. So I gotta run
[3487.89s -> 3508.96s]  this way. All right, go. Blue dot on the minimap. Oh shit, I see it. Oh bro, I got an axe now too.
[3508.96s -> 3524.43s]  You're fucked. I know what that is now. All right, I got it, I got it, I got it. You suck.
[3524.43s -> 3544.51s]  I don't. This game's hard. Blanker. All right, there it is, right there. I see the blue dot.
[3544.51s -> 3550.50s]  So get the axe first and then I'm going for it. Do two hits and you're out? Yeah, well, I, it's,
[3550.50s -> 3560.22s]  it's kind of tricky. So let me go get that first. That was what, down here? Yeah, right here.
[3560.78s -> 3570.58s]  So I got the axe. Now I shouldn't spawn him. I don't think he's gonna spawn unless I get over
[3570.58s -> 3578.85s]  there. I mean, you just hurt my feelings. I'm just kidding him. I'm just messing around. All right,
[3578.85s -> 3597.95s]  let's go. Find your way home. Oh shit, I live here. What? An eviction notice? They must have
[3597.95s -> 3602.99s]  changed the lock too. What? I need to get out of here before Santa finds me. The only way out of
[3602.99s -> 3621.70s]  here is along the train tracks. I turn the flashlight off. Get myself killed here. Can I
[3621.70s -> 3638.98s]  break this? Where is this motherfucker? I know he's here somewhere. Stairs onto the, wait,
[3638.98s -> 3662.13s]  the stairs. Go upstairs. I go. Where are the stairs? Stairs? Where are they? Where are they?
[3662.13s -> 3676.05s]  Where are the stairs? Where are the stairs? I don't see them. I got here late. What was
[3676.05s -> 3700.90s]  your Christmas gift? Is there a staircase up here that I didn't see? Where is it? Huh? Oh,
[3700.90s -> 3717.17s]  there I go. I just needed my glasses. I just needed my glasses. He's gonna be on the road here.
[3718.62s -> 3747.07s]  Wait, you know what I mean. That was one of my eye. My eye is burning. Two headphones going in.
[3747.07s -> 3754.66s]  Fuck it. I'm going real mode. For all the new viewers, I don't wear headphones. I only wear
[3754.66s -> 3760.26s]  one earbud because I'm like a baby and like I get sensory overload and I can't think and I can't
[3760.26s -> 3766.72s]  talk when there's sound going into both ears. So I have to do it like this. Otherwise I can't talk.
[3766.72s -> 3775.36s]  I swear to God that's not made up bullshit. It's real. See right now I'm like, I'm hitting a wall
[3775.36s -> 3783.82s]  of talking. I can't do it. I hate it. I need to be aware of my surroundings and I need to
[3783.82s -> 3793.63s]  hear my surroundings. I would rather there be mono audio coming through here and stereo coming
[3793.63s -> 3799.07s]  through here and I don't get to hear the left side. It sucks. All right. I got to pay attention.
[3799.07s -> 3809.70s]  This is important. What's all the stuff on the mini map? What's the green? There's a green thing
[3809.70s -> 3829.44s]  on the mini map. Oh, crowbar. Why would I get a, it's a gun. Gun. I have a gun. This guy's fucked.
[3829.44s -> 3836.19s]  Eight shots. All right. There's a crowbar. I think this is the final battle. This seems pretty final
[3836.19s -> 3841.50s]  battle-ish to me if I'm serious. What if I shoot him in the head? Does he just die?
[3842.14s -> 3859.02s]  Escape via the train tracks. Okay. See the gun. Why would I take an axe when I gotta get a gun?
[3860.67s -> 3880.11s]  16 shots. This guy is dead. What does he want me to go out here? Objective. Kill Santa. It is.
[3880.11s -> 3906.24s]  He's dead. Just give me a whatever. I'm just going to run around. I didn't, I didn't know
[3906.24s -> 3910.75s]  I had to shoot him that many times. Just a guy with an axe. If you shoot somebody in the head
[3910.75s -> 3963.10s]  with an axe, this is going to drop ammo. Let's go. Oh, your AI is fucking stupid. I win. Oh,
[3963.10s -> 4027.49s]  I don't have any bullets left. Fuck you. I need stamina. I can't run from him. I need stamina.
[4027.49s -> 4049.57s]  He's an idiot. He's an idiot. He's an idiot. Okay. I got time. Green dot is ammo. No, it's not. Shut
[4049.57s -> 4066.22s]  up. Is it really? Where's the gun? Where's the gun? Where's the gun? Where is he? What do I do
[4066.22s -> 4103.92s]  with the gun? What do I do with the gun? All right. He's dead. All right. He's dead. I'm going to,
[4103.92s -> 4111.23s]  I win. Poop face. That would be a really bad poop face. I feel like you'd want to go to the
[4111.23s -> 4119.10s]  doctor immediately. Give me the gun. All right. I got it. It's easy. I don't, I feel like the game
[4119.10s -> 4131.25s]  will fuck up if I pick that up. It's ammo. All right. So because the green, I thought the green
[4131.25s -> 4140.82s]  was the plant. 16. Let's get it all. You probably have to hit him every single time though. It's
[4140.82s -> 4152.46s]  probably like 30 shots. I thought it was something in the plant. I don't know. All right. I have 24
[4152.46s -> 4162.48s]  bullets. Garbage day. That's an old meme. All right. Let's do it. 24 shots. I'm not going to
[4162.48s -> 4168.50s]  shoot him yet. I'm going to get them onto the tracks and walk them backwards. Here we go.
[4169.06s -> 4216.00s]  Get the stamina up. Ready boys and girls. Oh, he's dead. He's dead. Oops. I thought he was,
[4216.00s -> 4257.63s]  I'm an idiot. I fucking missed. Oh my God. I'm going to blow the whole thing. Eat shit, Santa.
[4257.63s -> 4280.34s]  You killed Santa. Merry Christmas. I like that one. That was fun. That was fun. That was good.
[4280.34s -> 4295.20s]  That was good. That was good. That was fun. Do it again? Why would I do it again? All right.
[4295.20s -> 4303.97s]  Moving on. Coming up next. I need to make sure I got to keep track of these. Any more Christmas
[4303.97s -> 4318.34s]  ones? I think that's all the Christmas ones. I got to pee. Anybody else have to pee? Go pee.
[4318.34s -> 4323.14s]  We'll be right back. Pee break. Quick. And I kind of want to just put the BRB on. You know what I
[4323.14s -> 4483.95s]  mean? I just like the BRB. All right. Two minutes. Be right back. Okay. God, I love this. It's so
[4483.95s -> 4496.74s]  cute. Go support Blordow. For the love of God, please. He's got a band camp. I'm not even here
[4496.74s -> 4505.47s]  right now. Right? Like the thing you're hearing and the thing you are seeing is literally all
[4505.47s -> 4519.34s]  Blordow. It's his music and it's his art and animations. So go support Blordow. All right.
[4519.34s -> 4526.34s]  We're going to stay in the... I've actually seen this game played. So I can't tell you it's going
[4526.34s -> 4530.26s]  to be like a completely... Oh, I've never seen it before. But I feel like it looked like fun. I
[4530.26s -> 4536.51s]  didn't watch very much of it. We're going to play Knight of the Consumers. It's a game where you
[4536.51s -> 4543.09s]  have to like stock shelves or something. It's kind of scary. I don't know. I've seen it for like maybe
[4543.09s -> 4563.79s]  15 minutes of it so far. Looks like fun. And here we go. Coming back. Let me get this over here.
[4564.35s -> 4572.06s]  Open it up. Should see it very momentarily here. I put it on ultra graphics. Does that even matter?
[4572.38s -> 4589.46s]  I'm not sure that even matters. Warning. This game contains... Hold on. Warning. This game contains a
[4589.46s -> 4601.01s]  real retail experience. Knight of the Consumers. You don't stream in 1080. What's the point? Bit
[4601.01s -> 4616.51s]  rate. 1080. Not worth it. 60 FPS. Awful. Looks awful. You need at least 10 to 20,000 bit rate
[4616.51s -> 4625.36s]  to make 1080 look okay at 60. How many times do I have to tell you this? All right. What are the
[4625.36s -> 4638.62s]  controls? How do I play? I have no idea how to play. I have no clue. How do you do that?
[4638.62s -> 4661.46s]  Lots of lonely nights in the mirror. All right. Here we go. Hey, you're late. I just fell down.
[4662.93s -> 4667.66s]  You're late. But hey, since you're new around here, I'll cut you some slack.
[4669.44s -> 4675.94s]  My name is the manager. We're not too busy on days like these so you can have a nice easy shift to
[4675.94s -> 4684.05s]  help you get settled in. Remember, I got a reputation to uphold here. You won't have me
[4684.05s -> 4690.74s]  looking like a fool in front of the other manager, would you? The store is the best in town and I
[4690.74s -> 4696.69s]  would like to keep it that way. If any of my local customers aren't satisfied with your service,
[4696.69s -> 4703.68s]  I will be hearing about it. Now, go find Jimmy. He's been working here for a while now. Very loyal
[4703.68s -> 4724.18s]  employee. He'll show you the ropes. Put your stuff in the locker and get to it. Stuff in the locker.
[4724.18s -> 4749.65s]  All right. Where is... I don't remember that. You all right, Jimmy? I can't take this anymore.
[4749.65s -> 4756.26s]  I don't get paid enough for this. The rude customers. The endless amounts of sick
[4758.21s -> 4767.17s]  shit stains. I've reached my breaking point. Listen up. It's up to you now. There's still a
[4767.17s -> 4772.38s]  lot of empty shelves out there. They need to be stacked before we close. You don't want to upset
[4772.38s -> 4777.79s]  manager. Here, take this. It's all the notes I've made while working here. Those tips saved me time
[4777.79s -> 4790.22s]  and time again. All right. All right. I got notes. Hold shift is run. Left mouse is throw box. It
[4790.22s -> 4797.57s]  stuns them. Right mouse is drop box. When you're stacking a shelf, AD to look around. Hide in the
[4797.57s -> 4818.40s]  staff room. Don't get caught. Okay. The sprint kitchen. All right. Okay. You got to... All right.
[4818.40s -> 4823.31s]  What I've seen of this game is you got to make sure that you know where the places are. That's
[4823.31s -> 4832.80s]  all I remember. So we got kitchen furniture. All right. Kitchen's over here. So where is it? Right
[4832.80s -> 4858.61s]  here. So you hit space. Okay. You all got any of those P.T. clone games? I can't get enough of
[4858.61s -> 4869.87s]  them. Oh, I have to bring them to the right place. Toys. Video games. Right. Okay. I got to bring
[4869.87s -> 4875.79s]  them to the section, but don't get caught. Fucking same person. What are you doing? You got anything
[4875.79s -> 4888.48s]  with sugar in it? Magazines. Home cleaning. Pharmacy. Health and beauty. Pets. Alcohol. Drinks.
[4888.48s -> 4899.33s]  Sweets. There it is. What is this one? Video games. I can hide too, right? I can run away.

[6809.65s -> 6812.03s]  That's okay
[6812.03s -> 6816.80s]  And you don't even need to bloom who cares right? Like just just try to live your life as best you can
[6818.43s -> 6820.43s]  I think a lot of people are too concerned about
[6821.17s -> 6824.37s]  Trying to make it trying to do this trying to make sure you do this certain thing
[6825.01s -> 6827.01s]  Just do your best, you know
[6827.09s -> 6831.47s]  You don't have to bloom. You don't have to it's all right. You don't have to do that shit
[6833.86s -> 6836.02s]  Just try to live the best life you can with what you got
[6836.74s -> 6842.94s]  All right, this is called slide in the woods
[6855.87s -> 6860.59s]  22 20. Yeah, a lot of you guys are younger like trust me dude. I think about this
[6861.39s -> 6862.83s]  I am like
[6862.83s -> 6868.67s]  12 to 15 years older than a lot of you guys. I've been there before I I trust me. I know
[6870.61s -> 6875.68s]  In a long time
[6875.68s -> 6878.48s]  You'll figure it out. You'll find your place in the fucking world
[6880.00s -> 6883.92s]  But it doesn't have to be like extravagant. It doesn't have to be like I think a lot of people
[6884.48s -> 6886.48s]  There's a lot of pressure I think on people now
[6886.88s -> 6889.76s]  To have to do something extravagant like you have to
[6890.48s -> 6892.62s]  No, you don't
[6892.62s -> 6894.54s]  You really don't like
[6894.54s -> 6896.94s]  Just do you that's it man. Seriously
[6897.82s -> 6900.83s]  Too much pressure nowadays way too much

[6964.34s -> 6965.78s]  as I thought
[6965.78s -> 6967.90s]  But I was like 20
[6967.90s -> 6973.06s]  I thought I was like I have to be a famous film director and famous actor
[6974.42s -> 6976.82s]  No, that's too much pressure. Just just do what you can
[6977.92s -> 6980.56s]  If it fucking works out it works out if not, you'll find something to do
[6981.12s -> 6992.35s]  How many times have to go down the slide?

[7708.99s -> 7712.43s]  All right. I think it's time to take a break from the crazy shit
[7712.67s -> 7721.46s]  We're gonna play a little chill fun little game called freeways seems kind of fun. You have to make traffic patterns
[7721.86s -> 7738.94s]  By the way, all these are on itch.io freeways. It's kind of cool. We're freeways. There it is. Okay, does it show up?
[7740.82s -> 7742.85s]  Draw a road
[7742.85s -> 7744.29s]  Uh, hold on
[7744.29s -> 7754.10s]  this okay draw a road from the factory to highway six
[7758.83s -> 7765.98s]  Like that easy you must connect all the roads to all other roads
[7767.71s -> 7769.31s]  All right, so we're gonna go like this
[7769.31s -> 7775.04s]  Like that look highway signs to see which roads still need to be connected
[7775.36s -> 7794.29s]  Oh fuck. I'm not gonna be able to do this like that six needs to go to oh
[7797.63s -> 7804.30s]  oops
[7804.30s -> 7808.14s]  This needs to go over here. It does this needs to go that way. It does
[7808.62s -> 7818.40s]  Did I do it?
[7818.40s -> 7820.40s]  This person was shit faced
[7820.40s -> 7827.33s]  This bit of a shit face that made this make sense. Did I work? Did it work?
[7832.85s -> 7856.21s]  Look at the arrows. I got it. It works. I don't get it clear. Okay
[7856.69s -> 7859.89s]  Highway six needs to connect to 101 and one. Okay, so here we go
[7864.37s -> 7866.37s]  This needs to go here and here
[7866.69s -> 7873.92s]  Okay, you can go that way or that way
[7874.24s -> 7876.24s]  You can also go
[7878.30s -> 7894.67s]  Here I don't get it. I do it
[7897.15s -> 7902.26s]  I don't get it the directional arrows
[7906.75s -> 7919.33s]  I don't get it
[7932.26s -> 7934.26s]  By the way Boba Fett's in fortnight
[7935.87s -> 7951.84s]  Wait, all right traffic flow 71 complexity
[7952.40s -> 7954.80s]  Okay
[7954.80s -> 7957.70s]  New intersection. Let's go put over here
[7970.16s -> 8002.77s]  Everyone
[8003.01s -> 8011.47s]  Drive your fucking cars over here, dude the arrow what the hell drive let's go
[8012.35s -> 8046.13s]  Roundabout. Yeah, that's what i'm doing. I don't get it. Why is it not working drive your cars? It's fucking easy
[8046.37s -> 8072.03s]  It's kind of a mess
[8072.03s -> 8076.11s]  The direction you draw matters, okay 102 that's better than an a plus that's an s
[8077.71s -> 8092.42s]  So this is residential so green road. So this is a 17 north this goes down and this uh goes over here
[8092.58s -> 8102.42s]  This connects here. You can go to green road from here
[8103.70s -> 8106.10s]  splits
[8106.10s -> 8108.10s]  You can't go that way
[8110.78s -> 8130.34s]  That's the wrong way. So if this is a highway and this can go through here
[8131.15s -> 8133.15s]  And this can go through here
[8133.15s -> 8144.00s]  And then they'll just figure it out because they're fucking god damn animals who cares this is they put lights here. It's easy
[8163.66s -> 8165.66s]  We're all ants on the highway. Who cares?
[8166.35s -> 8175.78s]  We're all animals on the highway from space when they look down we're ants. We're all bugs. We're all animals. It doesn't matter
[8212.00s -> 8228.91s]  So what all right? What do I do? This is residential. You have like one road that comes out
[8229.86s -> 8235.49s]  One road that goes in play that
[8240.77s -> 8244.22s]  No idiot
[8244.22s -> 8248.69s]  And there's okay you get to get on the highway the highway's gonna go like here
[8250.42s -> 8253.46s]  I don't know highways do like a weird circle of shit. I don't know
[8288.26s -> 8300.98s]  I don't i'm not a city planner guys. We're all bugs. Who cares use ramps
[8306.85s -> 8308.69s]  Oh, wait a minute
[8308.69s -> 8326.05s]  All right, so that's above okay
[8328.59s -> 8370.37s]  I got it. What's the problem? What's going on? What's the problem people can come to and from wait a minute. Hold on
[8377.23s -> 8405.55s]  Mr. This dude's on coke. I don't get it. I don't I just can't I can't see things
[8406.17s -> 8411.14s]  Mathematically, give me the glasses. We're all bugs. God damn it. Who cares?
[8411.14s -> 8443.31s]  We're all animals from up above in space. You need a ramp. I don't guys I just drive on the road
[8443.31s -> 8448.40s]  I don't know how it works. I just go like this whenever I get to the port part where you guys are describing
[8448.56s -> 8452.26s]  I go like this
[8452.26s -> 8457.78s]  Big circle big circle big circle big circle big circle big circle big circle big circle big circle big circle straight line
[8457.86s -> 8467.68s]  Oh, okay. Somebody planned this that's smarter than me. Uh, what's the game called freeways on itchy? EO freeways
[8467.76s -> 8484.18s]  It's like three bucks. I don't get it. I'm moving on. I don't get it highways go like
[8489.17s -> 8496.69s]  They keep going
[8496.69s -> 8501.65s]  Highway it like take you get off the highway, but the highway the road keeps going
[8506.82s -> 8508.82s]  How this way?
[8509.82s -> 8511.82s]  And then this way
[8512.48s -> 8515.26s]  And then this way
[8515.26s -> 8517.02s]  And then this way
[8517.02s -> 8528.03s]  I don't I don't I I don't understand. I can't do this. I I can't do it. I I don't have the fucking mathematics to reconnect everything
[8548.51s -> 8561.55s]  Now take your goddamn turns
[8584.78s -> 8591.55s]  Oh shit
[8596.69s -> 8617.20s]  That was freeways it's fun if you're smarter than I am go ahead and play it it's a cool game

[8638.34s -> 8640.42s]  I'm not looking forward to this. It's gonna be horrible
[8642.02s -> 8654.80s]  Lower your volume

[18284.69s -> 18295.55s]  Um, I don't know the last dream. I remember just drinking Gatorade out of somebody else's fridge
[18299.66s -> 18302.38s]  And it was like all the gatorades were mixed together it was weird
[18302.62s -> 18314.54s]  It was like all yellow purple green and red gatorade were all mixed together
[18314.94s -> 18321.38s]  Like they got the gatorades down to like here and they poured the last third of it into the same gatorade
[18321.86s -> 18325.04s]  And they did that they did that with like six of them
[18325.81s -> 18328.85s]  So they didn't want to drink the last like gross part of the gatorade
[18328.85s -> 18361.30s]  So they combined them all and put them back in the fridge and I drank it. All right, I got it
[18361.46s -> 18391.78s]  So I wait I gotta explore what's down here, okay, now what draw ingredients I need more colors

[18491.81s -> 18495.04s]  Get out of here. Oh my god. Why?
[18503.89s -> 18513.95s]  Here's what happened. I accidentally pinned the spider exe file to the taskbar and I kept thinking it was open
[18514.59s -> 18518.83s]  So I kept right clicking it to close it, but I kept opening new instances of the exe
[18523.18s -> 18525.34s]  So let's unpin that from the taskbar
[18527.20s -> 18528.08s]  and
[18528.08s -> 18531.02s]  Keep going

[18923.44s -> 18932.16s]  I guess I have no idea. I guess twitch is having problems. It's not a twitch problem
[18932.16s -> 18954.26s]  It's a spider problem. The real question is is he gonna draw boogers down both the nostrils?

[20119.81s -> 20122.05s]  I got all these on itch.io only like a few of them were on steam
[20133.30s -> 20137.38s]  I got all these on itch.io because I heard that itch.io gives a higher cut to people right?
[20138.32s -> 20140.05s]  then steam does
