[1.72s -> 6.01s]  My hello there. Sorry, my mic was a little fucked up.
[15.56s -> 24.58s]  Can you hear that? Speaking of fucked up, the internet's not having a good time right now,
[24.58s -> 38.30s]  is it? Uh oh. This is happening two nights ago too, wasn't it?
[46.71s -> 52.07s]  I can't listen to this thing. If you're wondering what that noise is,
[55.34s -> 63.02s]  that's the Dreamcast. But can't really do much of anything right now.
[63.74s -> 74.49s]  Figured that we were just kind of going over a bad internet bump, but it's not the case right now.
[77.51s -> 81.99s]  Dropped a thousand frames in the first three minutes of the stream. That's not good.
[88.58s -> 95.56s]  We'll give it a few minutes, otherwise I am gonna have to get off and call,
[96.44s -> 104.09s]  because this would be the second stream in a row. We've had about two straight good months
[104.09s -> 112.07s]  of no internet problems, so. Anyways, if we do get to stream, the idea is,
[112.71s -> 118.87s]  can I like, all right, it's gonna, all I have to do is cover the vent. Where the fan comes,
[118.87s -> 123.29s]  just cover the fan with like a piece of tape, and then you can't hear it, right?
[124.01s -> 130.38s]  I forgot how fucking loud of Dreamcast is tonight. Sorry, I'm getting thrown off a
[130.38s -> 136.14s]  little bit here from the internet problem. But those of you that remember, it's a nostalgia,
[136.14s -> 144.57s]  it's a nostalgia trip tonight. I'll show you just how much of a nostalgia trip in about
[144.73s -> 151.29s]  five seconds when you see the date that's on the screen. Set up a date and time for the Dreamcast
[152.82s -> 172.71s]  12-27-1998. 2008, 2018, this is 21 years ago. What's today's date? Can you, are you even
[172.71s -> 179.19s]  allowed to go past the year 2000? What's the final year you're allowed to put in for Dreamcast?
[183.83s -> 185.59s]  I guess it can go as far as you want.
[190.07s -> 197.56s]  I wasn't even born yet? All right, let's keep it nostalgic. No, wait, isn't that gonna fuck up
[197.56s -> 203.30s]  like the internal clock or something? What if I play a game that needs the correct date?
[203.30s -> 209.06s]  Well, this is not connected to the internet, so it doesn't matter. All right, today is,
[210.60s -> 219.40s]  uh, what the hell is today? January 20, it's January 25th, 1998, and it is, is this a 24-hour
[219.40s -> 228.76s]  clock? It is. It is three, four, five, six a.m., seven a.m., eight a.m., nine a.m.,
[228.76s -> 234.60s]  ten a.m., eleven a.m., twelve noon, one, two, three, twenty-one.
[238.54s -> 244.50s]  All right, that looks good. Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes! Oh no, wait, what?
[245.30s -> 258.60s]  Where was the, the intro? Where's the Ted Talk intro? I pressed back?
[262.01s -> 267.38s]  I gotta restart the console. All right, well, we're good, right? What about music?
[269.62s -> 283.38s]  What's even on here? Oh, I gotta show this on camera, too, because, whoa!
[333.77s -> 342.52s]  That's me, uh, okay, so again, I gotta be careful here, uh, because that is,
[344.46s -> 350.02s]  so take a look what happens, right? It take, it captures the last frame that you did.
[350.74s -> 377.82s]  So for like, I gotta remember, like, hold on, whatever, I don't fucking care. All right,
[377.82s -> 382.79s]  I should be in sync now, whatever, I don't fucking give a shit. You think anything
[382.79s -> 397.16s]  embarrasses me anymore? Not really. So here's the Dreamcast controller, if you don't, if
[397.16s -> 403.69s]  you've never seen this before. I wasn't naked on camera, okay? I, look, I was going like
[403.69s -> 409.98s]  this, I was like this, and I leaned up and you didn't, you just couldn't see,
[409.98s -> 415.96s]  I, these were bunched up under my chin. I just didn't, look, I didn't have a shirt on,
[415.96s -> 429.53s]  but it was like closed up. Anyways, okay, here's the Dreamcast controller. The interesting thing
[429.53s -> 433.69s]  about, I can't even do like a look and welcome to the stream tutorial, look at the Dreamcast
[433.69s -> 443.66s]  controller now. It's fine, whatever. I don't think anything fucking embarrasses me anymore.
[444.87s -> 452.90s]  The interesting, the interesting thing about the Dreamcast controller is, if I can get it out,
[457.13s -> 463.48s]  shave your armpits. I, I will. I actually did that. My armpit hair grows exponentially.
[476.79s -> 484.70s]  So the interesting thing about the Dreamcast is this thing comes out. Isn't that interesting,
[484.70s -> 492.55s]  folks? This is the memory card and the memory card is also a little screen. And you put
[492.55s -> 495.43s]  that in here. Look, there's a slot right there. You can have two of these in there
[495.43s -> 512.65s]  if you didn't know. Take a look at that. It snaps in and there it is. Every game has a little
[512.65s -> 518.97s]  screen. Every game has fucking long armpit hair and every game turns on their webcam
[518.97s -> 526.15s]  with a frame of them with no clothes on. So anyways, let's get started here. We have to
[526.15s -> 534.79s]  reset it so we can hear the Ted Talk intro. I'm going to put it in. The reason why I'm
[534.79s -> 541.40s]  not going to start with Tony Hawk is because if I start with Tony Hawk 2,
[542.20s -> 546.28s]  that's going to be the whole stream. And I can't just do the whole stream as Tony Hawk.
[547.00s -> 553.05s]  So there were a handful of other great games for the Dreamcast that are exclusive.
[553.77s -> 564.22s]  Like for instance, Survival Horror. There were a handful of Survival Horror games that
[564.22s -> 571.14s]  only came out on the Dreamcast. Like The Ring, Blue Stinger, Carrier. There's at least three
[571.14s -> 577.38s]  or four. We've also got Dynamite Cop, which is one of my favorite arcade games ever made.
[578.18s -> 583.64s]  And we've got some other random fucked up stupid shit. So I'm going to probably have
[583.64s -> 590.57s]  to say we're going to start with The Ring. We have to. This is The Ring. This is the game.
[590.57s -> 599.42s]  This is what the movie was based on. What? I don't know why the fuck. Logitech and OBS.
[599.42s -> 612.57s]  Why did you do that? So Logitech and, uh, okay. Here it is. This is The Ring,
[612.57s -> 617.10s]  Terror's Realm, exclusive to Dreamcast. Can't get it anywhere else.
[617.90s -> 626.50s]  Let's go ahead and do this. Here it comes. Here it comes. Here it comes.
[631.06s -> 649.48s]  It didn't even do it. Why? What? Do it. Here it comes. It's not even going to do it.
[651.90s -> 655.66s]  Wait, I can't reset it right now. Listen, this is like somebody's cutting meat at the
[655.66s -> 671.43s]  deli. Listen to this shit. Hey, you want some salami? I'll get it for you.
[673.06s -> 703.19s]  Is that good? Is that thickness good? I gotta move this thing down.
[703.19s -> 710.14s]  Please, you have to help me. First Dreamcast game of the night
[710.78s -> 714.14s]  is going to be The Ring, Terror's Realm, and Dreamcast. That's what that's true.
[714.14s -> 719.26s]  I need to, this is so unbearable. I need to fucking move this down and I can put
[719.26s -> 739.18s]  like a blanket on it. Let me put it down here. It's too loud. I can't even concentrate.
[739.90s -> 754.25s]  Okay, that's better. This looks like a SNES menu. Yeah, it does.
[755.96s -> 759.16s]  All right, let's, uh, let's get started. This is The Ring. 1991.
[759.96s -> 770.58s]  New game, low game options. Nickelodeon presents The Ring, Terror's Realm.
[772.90s -> 791.05s]  Okay, uh, I'm just going to play, I think. Meg? Robert, get the job? Yeah, I'll be working
[791.05s -> 794.73s]  with you starting tomorrow. So I guess I'll be seeing you soon. Really? That's great.
[794.73s -> 800.01s]  So why don't we go out for a celebratory drink? Okay. I'll be ready. Promise? Promise.
[800.01s -> 808.26s]  Bye for now. Is he going to watch The Ring video? She thinks she is. She hasn't any idea
[808.26s -> 836.17s]  of how important this project is, but it's not a goal. What's happening? Robert, he didn't
[836.17s -> 840.65s]  sound so pleased, even though it's been quite a while since we spoke. He's absolutely missed
[840.65s -> 846.73s]  a thick head. Easy! What the fuck was that? Well, today's the day. He has to make up for it.
[847.69s -> 859.29s]  Don't go out of a garage like that. You got to slow down. It's a new Resident Evil 2.
[860.25s -> 880.76s]  This is the GTA driver. Why is it so dark? Robert? Yeah, I think we're just gonna have
[880.76s -> 885.24s]  to do it that way. And that's just it. Hey, hey, miss. No, I'm sorry. You can't
[885.24s -> 889.34s]  come in here. You're gonna have to get out of here. Or do you live here? What's
[889.34s -> 894.94s]  happened, officer? What's happened, officer? I'm asking you a question. Do you live here?
[894.94s -> 911.02s]  Hello? Miss? What the fuck? Hey, hey, stop. That punch sound. They only had like four
[911.02s -> 919.94s]  punch sound effects. I got hit sound. You okay, lady? Okay, this is way I need to
[919.94s -> 926.63s]  increase the brightness or something. Meg, Meg, what's going on over there?
[926.71s -> 930.87s]  Like, hey, man, what's happening here? Hold on a moment, sir. I know the two of them.
[930.87s -> 937.59s]  They're friends. What happened? I don't believe this. I see. Oh, Meg. Could you
[937.59s -> 942.23s]  explain your relationship to either her or the victim? This is like a bunch of
[942.23s -> 947.43s]  YouTubers made this or something. I'm Jack, and this is Robert's girlfriend, Meg.
[948.97s -> 955.90s]  Oh, I see. Well, I'm sorry. What happened to Robert? Actually, we don't yet exactly
[955.90s -> 963.02s]  know what happened to him this evening. You don't know? Isn't this a murder? It's
[963.02s -> 969.42s]  unlikely to be a homicide case. Not a murder? Then what's that? Did you see his
[969.42s -> 974.94s]  face? What's happened? Oh, my God. Well, we'll get to the bottom of this.
[977.26s -> 982.94s]  I'm still alive. I'll work for this company. I'm still alive. Don't worry. I
[982.94s -> 1001.77s]  shouldn't mourn your death forever. Right. I can't help it. The Dreamcast is so loud. Hold on. Wait.
[1005.38s -> 1008.66s]  Wait, wait a minute. Tell him it gets worse.
[1011.38s -> 1093.45s]  Make it stop. Here? I can fix this. This is my room starting today. It's a weird feeling.
[1094.41s -> 1113.88s]  When do I get to control the game? Robert. No good comes from me moping around all the time.
[1114.44s -> 1117.88s]  I have to do my best. Is this the same lady in the cutscene that we just watched?
[1119.16s -> 1128.41s]  Okay, I'm walking now. It's tank controls, which that's fucking fantastic.
[1129.53s -> 1143.42s]  What the fuck? Oh, that's sprint. Is it, though? How did I just do that? I have no idea
[1143.42s -> 1154.26s]  how I'm doing that. Is it reverse tank? How do I get out of the door? Get the phones ringing.
[1155.06s -> 1166.47s]  Hello. Meg, it's Jack. Are you settled in? Yes, today's my first day. I'm so sorry to make you
[1166.47s -> 1171.75s]  worry so much. Don't worry about it. I know you're going through tough times and I'm like
[1171.75s -> 1177.96s]  this. No. At times like this, it's easier to be worried about others. I'm reading this so
[1177.96s -> 1186.20s]  wrong. Oh yeah, by the way, did you look at Robert's computer? Computer? I see his laptop
[1186.20s -> 1192.92s]  here. Something the matter with it? No, actually I heard a slightly strange story. A strange story?
[1194.84s -> 1201.56s]  About a CQC lab. I'm not pressing any buttons. Died at the same time in the same way at Robert.
[1204.30s -> 1207.90s]  Same time in the same way. I don't think it's a coincidence I've never seen anyone die like
[1207.90s -> 1215.99s]  that. You're right, but what does that have to do with the computer? Yeah, about the computer.
[1216.63s -> 1220.87s]  Both of them were found dead in front of their computer. Jack, now isn't that a coincidence?
[1222.07s -> 1228.28s]  No, I have more. Robert and both lab workers running a program called Ring on their computers.
[1230.71s -> 1238.30s]  Hang? Yeah, hang. The police thought it was suspicious. They tried to analyze it,
[1238.30s -> 1244.86s]  but no matter what they did, it wouldn't boot. The program wouldn't boot? Yeah, apparently this
[1244.86s -> 1251.24s]  is just two AI talking to each other. This is just learning English. Take this text right
[1251.24s -> 1259.11s]  here and add the learning English YouTube video bullshit on here. Yeah, apparently. In any case,
[1259.11s -> 1263.85s]  I'll check up on the details about it now. But until then, I think it's better if you
[1263.85s -> 1269.13s]  didn't touch the computer. Don't touch the computer? But it doesn't boot, right? Besides,
[1269.13s -> 1275.61s]  Jack, are you saying that Robert died thanks to a computer program? You know, I am a
[1275.61s -> 1280.73s]  scientist. I would rather understand. I would understand if it was a virus in CQC, but from
[1280.73s -> 1293.67s]  a computer, I know, but I have a bad feeling about this. You're a worrywart. I'll be fine.
[1296.25s -> 1302.15s]  In any case, I'll call you again when I find something out. Thanks. Now I'm taking over
[1302.15s -> 1308.07s]  Robert's job starting today. That's good. I'm sure Robert's happy about that. I don't think
[1308.07s -> 1315.38s]  Robert's happy about being dead. Why would you be happy about this? Thanks for everything,
[1315.38s -> 1320.25s]  Jack. Yeah, I'll call you again. Just talking to the fax machine. All right, bye. That's not
[1320.25s -> 1333.48s]  the phone. That's a calculator. Okay, that was, let's go. I gotta examine Robert's computer,
[1333.48s -> 1341.88s]  right? Am I about to watch the Ring video? Ring, the killer computer program. This is
[1341.88s -> 1347.82s]  silly. This is what the movie was based on. This is it. Don't watch it! Don't! I don't
[1347.82s -> 1355.50s]  want to watch this! Meg. Uh, by the way, guys, everybody that's watching right now,
[1355.50s -> 1362.49s]  I'm really sorry, but it's seven days from now. I think we're gonna be around.
[1362.49s -> 1365.69s]  The reason why Robert died might be hidden inside this. I'm gonna try.
[1366.65s -> 1384.22s]  There she go. Uh-oh. We're all gonna get ringed. Here it comes. This is the Ring video.
[1385.02s -> 1401.67s]  It's people in ice cubes. Wait, why are we in here? This is the Ring video?
[1402.79s -> 1421.10s]  I booted up a program called Ring on the computer. Anyway, I should investigate. What are
[1421.10s -> 1429.88s]  you doing? What I'm doing, booting up this computer. What are you saying? Well, in the
[1429.88s -> 1433.56s]  situation we're in, I can understand you're getting confused. The situation making me
[1433.56s -> 1438.76s]  wear this and all. Where in the world is this? This place? This is our battlefield against
[1438.76s -> 1448.02s]  them. Them? What are you saying? Oh, I'm in the computer game. We have no time for this.
[1448.02s -> 1451.78s]  One of them has snuck in here. I'll check the first floor. You go check the second.
[1452.74s -> 1457.62s]  Check the second floor? Enough of this already. Is that gun you're holding a fake?
[1457.62s -> 1460.82s]  Quit yacking and go kill them off. If you're too slow, they'll get us.
[1461.54s -> 1465.86s]  Kill them? But you're the one that made me hold this gun. There's no way I can use
[1465.86s -> 1468.98s]  it without learning how. I'm appalled that someone would stand here without knowing how
[1468.98s -> 1475.58s]  to use a gun. Are you with the informants? This is just learning English. Here's a
[1475.58s -> 1481.86s]  quick rundown. Keep your ears open. First try pushing left trigger. That turns the flashlight
[1482.74s -> 1491.27s]  on. You can move it with just complete darkness there for a second. Okay. If you keep the
[1491.27s -> 1495.66s]  flashlight on, they'll find you immediately. So be careful not to try pushing right
[1495.66s -> 1509.62s]  trigger. Now shoot me! That's your aim. The gun automatically targets within 45 degrees
[1509.62s -> 1515.91s]  in front of you, but it only targets where the flashlight shines. The gun shoots if you
[1515.91s -> 1533.00s]  push the A button while aiming. Try aiming and firing. Yeah, that's it. That gun has a
[1533.00s -> 1536.28s]  laser sight, so it should be easy to tell where you're aiming. Be careful, some weapons
[1536.28s -> 1540.76s]  don't have sights. Next, equipping weapons. The status screen appears when you push.
[1540.76s -> 1546.79s]  What does this have to do with the ring? Somebody came up with an idea for the ring
[1546.79s -> 1553.14s]  for a video game, and then they realized that what are you supposed to do besides
[1553.14s -> 1558.28s]  watch the movie and die? So they put you inside of a computer program, which is
[1558.28s -> 1573.13s]  like an FPS shooter game, and this is us watching it, I guess. I have no idea. This
[1573.13s -> 1576.73s]  is Resident Evil. They were like, yeah, I guess just make Resident Evil again somehow.
[1578.97s -> 1585.45s]  Item. There's a handgun and a knife, and we are fine. Everything is just fine.
[1586.41s -> 1595.66s]  S item. Still dropping frames. This is kind of consistently sort of awful.
[1596.62s -> 1606.70s]  It's, oh, it's okay, but not good. We checked, right, and last changing viewpoints.
[1607.82s -> 1615.72s]  If you push the Y button, it'll shift to first-person view. Change the line of sight
[1615.72s -> 1620.68s]  with the analog thumb pad and look around. You return to this view and you let go of
[1620.68s -> 1628.68s]  the Y button. Oh, you have to hold it. Those are the basic controls of the game.
[1628.68s -> 1631.64s]  Anything else you need to learn on your own? Do you want me to go over that? No,
[1631.72s -> 1656.98s]  don't go over that again. Go check out the second floor. Be very careful. What's this?
[1656.98s -> 1661.70s]  How do I pick step up? You found a healing jelly. Pick it up. Yes.
[1662.90s -> 1667.82s]  Why would you ever play this game? Is there a speedrun with this game with all,
[1669.91s -> 1681.19s]  all the lights turned off? I can't use the analog either, and there's no fun
[1681.19s -> 1691.98s]  Dreamcast thing in the middle. What's upstairs? Oh, I forgot. It's an old game. You have to
[1691.98s -> 1721.69s]  actually load. It's too dark. Give me the healing jelly. All right, this is actually that the
[1721.69s -> 1727.62s]  perspective is actually kind of scary, although it's hard to even determine what the hell
[1727.62s -> 1733.78s]  my character is in these hallways. I'm gonna get jumped out. What was that? Oh,
[1735.46s -> 1744.70s]  flashlight in the screen, I guess. What is this? There aren't any enemies here.
[1744.70s -> 1757.18s]  This is stupid. That's the enemy. He wants me to kill that. He's reckless. I have to do it,
[1757.18s -> 1781.08s]  I guess. All right. Who bullets over here? It's like a book or a briefcase or a bullets. What
[1781.08s -> 1798.14s]  is it? Handgun bolts. Okay. More handgun bolts. Good. Next. Hold on. Not yet. Not quite.
[1798.94s -> 1812.26s]  We have to get past the first tutorial area. So did I do it? Is that the only thing he
[1812.26s -> 1819.38s]  wanted me to do? At least give me seven minutes in this game or seven, well, seven days. Never
[1819.38s -> 1841.46s]  mind. That would be a bad idea. I hate tank controls so much. Here's your five second loop
[1842.34s -> 1848.74s]  of the same song. I defeated the upstairs enemy, but now how do I? What? My body.
[1849.54s -> 1858.28s]  I feel I'm getting pulled pulling out is what's happening.
[1865.98s -> 1876.04s]  So now I die in seven days because I watched the shitty Resident Evil
[1876.20s -> 1892.50s]  game. That was the ring. Uh oh. I passed out this program. What was that about?
[1892.50s -> 1898.41s]  Ring? It's just a game. Really? Jack should hold off with his jokes once in a while.
[1901.62s -> 1904.50s]  Jack? Sheesh. I have no, I have to give him a piece of my mind.
[1907.06s -> 1915.82s]  Hello? Oh, here it is. Yeah. Seven days. Here it comes.
[1916.70s -> 1925.32s]  Seven. Dead. Oh. Seven more days. Seven. Only seven days.
[1931.27s -> 1933.51s]  Power outage, a crank call, and a weird program.
[1935.35s -> 1938.55s]  Seven more days. I'm going to die in seven days. You've got to be kidding.
[1940.55s -> 1965.66s]  Oh, because he loaded a fucking Doom II box here. Open the box. Nothing in here.
[1977.86s -> 1984.14s]  Healing jelly in the office. Nothing of interest here. Nothing in the sink.
[1995.74s -> 2003.77s]  Uh oh. It's Chris. Excuse me. My name is Chris. Are you Meg? Hello, Chris. I'm Meg.
[2003.77s -> 2009.85s]  Meg Rainman. It is a pleasure to meet you. You don't have to be so formal. My pleasure
[2009.85s -> 2014.65s]  to meet you. I know it's sudden, but the chief is asking for you. A guide to the chief's
[2014.65s -> 2026.12s]  office. I can't take, I can't. Sorry. It's fine with me. He-he, you're acting so formal. Well,
[2026.12s -> 2038.18s]  then this way. It really is. It's Chris. Meg. If the boss's name is Peter,
[2039.61s -> 2044.81s]  and there's a lowest involved too, then we've got the whole family. Oh, Brian.
[2044.81s -> 2054.92s]  Chris. Meg. Please tell me this guy's name is Brian. Or Peter. Nice to meet you,
[2054.92s -> 2059.24s]  chief. I'm Meg Rainman. Sorry I was late. I'm at your services starting today.
[2061.78s -> 2065.86s]  Chief Brian. What's his name? Thanks for coming. I'm looking forward to your work.
[2066.74s -> 2071.54s]  I'm sorry we caused you so much trouble with this case. What are you saying? We were the
[2071.54s -> 2079.54s]  ones who were serviced by Robert. It was a shame to end up that way. We have to work hard now to
[2079.54s -> 2088.84s]  make up for our loss of Robert. Yes, I think so too. By the way, about Robert. You heard that
[2088.84s -> 2094.04s]  three lab members, including him, passed away? Yes, I heard that they all passed away at the
[2094.04s -> 2101.86s]  same exact time. That's right. For such an accident, there is a high chance that it was a
[2101.86s -> 2109.86s]  virus. I assume so. This is the CDC after all. Yes, this is the best facility against disease
[2109.86s -> 2114.50s]  for the public. No, for the world. I don't even know what he said. We are investigating on our
[2114.50s -> 2120.34s]  own but cannot figure out the cause of death. However, the executives are fretful. They want to
[2120.34s -> 2124.90s]  make an explanation as soon as possible. I can't. I have to turn the music off. Just now an
[2124.90s -> 2129.06s]  evacuation order has been issued. They're shutting this lab down. They've prohibited
[2129.06s -> 2137.06s]  us from leaving the facility. It's speech jamming. Prohibit us from leaving? That means
[2139.14s -> 2144.42s]  you could say we have been quarantined. Impossible. I'm so sorry about this happening
[2144.42s -> 2148.66s]  on your birthday, but it's not that unusual for this stuff. Well, the evacuation order
[2148.66s -> 2154.26s]  for the whole town is, rest assured, it will only be for two, three days. All right,
[2154.26s -> 2158.58s]  I understand. Fortunately, you are free to roam in the facility. Have a look around the place.
[2160.18s -> 2165.94s]  Right now we're checking for virus leakage from the basement. You know, just like my water cooler
[2165.94s -> 2178.58s]  broke. Look at my virus leakage. I'm gonna call like an HVAC guy. All right, then Chris. Yes.
[2184.78s -> 2189.10s]  Mute the music. I can't. This card will be your key and your identification within
[2189.10s -> 2192.78s]  the facilities. Make sure you don't lose it. Yes, I will be careful.
[2193.50s -> 2199.91s]  Look around. Excuse me.
[2218.50s -> 2219.78s]  There is no, I can't do it.
[2227.62s -> 2233.38s]  There is no muting the music, guys. It's here forever. Doesn't open.
[2235.90s -> 2237.98s]  The reference room. It doesn't open without a key.
[2248.57s -> 2249.77s]  All right, let's go to the kitchen.
[2253.45s -> 2258.20s]  I like the music. Can I use the fire extinguisher?
[2264.63s -> 2272.07s]  You know, it's funny because I'm just like in poker, right? I got a deck of cards and I got
[2272.07s -> 2278.15s]  a hand. I got a good hand. I'm gonna fold a couple of bad hands. Forget this reference.
[2278.15s -> 2282.47s]  I can't talk with this music playing. I'm taking my headphones out to say this.
[2283.03s -> 2291.10s]  So, you never want to show your hand in poker, okay? You guys don't know. Right now you can see
[2291.10s -> 2297.10s]  like, this is like a 10, right? You know, I have like a jack, I got a queen, I got a king,
[2297.10s -> 2301.74s]  and I also got an ace. And they're the same suit, which is the Dreamcast.
[2302.94s -> 2305.66s]  So don't worry. Okay, now I can fucking put my headphones in.
[2307.18s -> 2332.47s]  What the fuck are you doing? All right, here's, okay, if we go back into the game,
[2333.99s -> 2339.99s]  if we have to go back into the ring video game, then I will change to the next game.
[2341.88s -> 2347.51s]  But, hold on. The locker room, I see. This facility is sure well equipped.
[2350.70s -> 2369.21s]  I have to kill the ring. I'm not going to complete this game. I literally had to mute
[2369.21s -> 2374.52s]  the stream. Oh my god. All right, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I'll get it
[2374.76s -> 2385.14s]  out of here. Hold on. I first need to do the Resident Evil, open the door,
[2385.70s -> 2393.82s]  transition loading screen. Wait, this is, uh, Lucino. This is the men's locker room.
[2393.82s -> 2400.30s]  Do you want anything? Sorry, I made a mistake. Yeah, I didn't know today's my first day.
[2400.30s -> 2430.17s]  You know, that you can get out now. Sorry. Okay, I'm gonna save everybody here. There.
[2431.29s -> 2439.70s]  It's nice to have nobody around. No changes at all. Do I have to go back in the computer?
[2440.50s -> 2447.02s]  There's nothing much here. All right, here we go. I'm gonna go back in the computer.
[2449.35s -> 2464.28s]  I'm gonna log back in. Nothing happened. I can still hear it. Okay, I got, I activated,
[2464.28s -> 2477.32s]  I activated the event that I need to activate. Phone rings. Pick it up. Has it, I've been
[2477.32s -> 2483.45s]  walking around for a full day. I heard there's a possibility of a virus leak from the CDC.
[2485.05s -> 2489.45s]  It's the top headline on every news show. It's only a possibility. They said it wasn't too
[2489.45s -> 2495.14s]  uncommon around here, so don't worry. They say it's not uncommon. Anyway, Jack, that ring you
[2495.14s -> 2501.90s]  mentioned earlier, it was just a game. That program booted? I had no problems, and there
[2501.90s -> 2507.90s]  can be no way that a computer program can kill someone. Nothing really happened. Nothing.
[2507.90s -> 2512.30s]  You worry too much. Although, speaking of something happening, I had a prank call right
[2512.30s -> 2518.70s]  afterwards. All right, call. Yes. Hey, there was a weird word on the screen.
[2521.22s -> 2527.35s]  It said dead. What do you mean weird word? It said dead. I think it meant game over.
[2528.49s -> 2534.82s]  That's not too funny. Anyway, did you figure anything out? All right, well,
[2534.82s -> 2542.34s]  every time somebody plays Dark Souls, that's like, that's not funny. I don't like that.
[2542.34s -> 2544.82s]  That's right. Apparently, Robert's body was handed over to the CDC.
[2545.62s -> 2548.58s]  The CDC. I wonder if it's to find out the cause of death.
[2550.54s -> 2553.50s]  But now, I guess I'll be able to find out directly. Thank you for your
[2553.50s -> 2557.50s]  Dark Souls reference in every stream. Don't go overboard. I'll call you again if I find anything.
[2561.48s -> 2572.86s]  Talk to you later. Yes. Robert. Am I gonna get another phone call? For now,
[2572.86s -> 2580.81s]  I should ask the chief. Oh my god. Not much longer, I promise. They were the ones
[2580.81s -> 2584.17s]  that Robert's body was handed over to. I know the chief is looking out for me still.
[2584.17s -> 2587.61s]  I wish he had told me about this. First thing now is to go talk to the chief.
[2587.61s -> 2594.17s]  That's why I opened the door. How many redundancies are there in one video?
[2596.47s -> 2602.15s]  No, not much longer. Don't you guys know the rules? When we do like a retro game night
[2602.15s -> 2607.83s]  on an old console, it's 40 minutes. We have to give it at least 30 to 40 minutes.
[2615.45s -> 2629.21s]  Yeah, that's the rule. Where's the chief's office? There's no information on here.
[2629.21s -> 2633.77s]  Information? What information? I don't see any information.
[2634.49s -> 2646.70s]  Where's the chief's office? You don't get a hamburger from a restaurant and take
[2646.70s -> 2651.42s]  one bite and then put it down. No, it's two bites. The first bite is to go,
[2652.14s -> 2655.58s]  hold on. That's all right. No, I don't know. And then the second bite is to
[2655.58s -> 2663.10s]  determine if you're gonna get food poisoning, right? And the third or fourth bite is if you're
[2663.10s -> 2665.26s]  gonna get food poisoning but you don't care because you're hungry and you know it's
[2665.26s -> 2667.98s]  gonna happen anyway, so you just eat the rest of the rotten turkey sandwich that was in
[2667.98s -> 2686.06s]  the trash. Does anybody remember where the chief's office is? All right, all right.
[2686.06s -> 2700.33s]  It's been like 40 minutes. It has. All right. Oh, I gotta go. I'm on the wrong floor.
[2701.13s -> 2708.62s]  You guys are good. Oh wait, there's a new character introduction here.
[2714.90s -> 2720.34s]  That's okay. No, that's Peter and Megan. This is a localization joke. There's Peter.
[2722.20s -> 2731.98s]  We found the localization of humor. Yep, that happened. Yes. This is somebody just,
[2731.98s -> 2738.95s]  this is 1998, okay? What happened was the person localizing this, wherever they were,
[2739.75s -> 2745.75s]  just, what's, what was popular in the West right now? Family Guy was just barely taken
[2745.75s -> 2750.63s]  off as a popular show, wasn't it? Whatever, just name them. People in the West love Family
[2750.63s -> 2761.88s]  Guy, all right? Hold on, wait. Family Guy came out in 1999. When did this game come out?
[2762.84s -> 2768.98s]  There's no way. No, yeah, there is Family Guy. When did, when did, when did the game come out,
[2768.98s -> 2789.37s]  though? Well, I don't care about this. I'm looking at the front, okay? This came out,
[2789.37s -> 2799.78s]  the copyright on the disc is 2000. So not 1998, 2000. When did the first episode of Family
[2799.78s -> 2812.34s]  Guy air? 1999. So yeah, it had to be. All right, let's move on. So that was a survival
[2812.34s -> 2815.94s]  horror. That was the Ring, Terror's Realm. I'm going to put that in the collector's dish,
[2816.74s -> 2820.50s]  because it's a collector's item. So I think we got to move on from there. We got to play
[2820.50s -> 2825.38s]  a good one, right? And I'm going to play right now, one of my favorite arcade games
[2825.38s -> 2829.78s]  ever made. So Strapping, you might be here for, this is going to be at least a 40 minute
[2829.78s -> 2846.33s]  thing here. Going in next is none other than Dynamite Cop. This is the best arcade game
[2846.33s -> 2860.06s]  ever made. It actually, I think it was called Die Hard in the arcades. Maybe we'll actually get
[2860.06s -> 2872.44s]  to hear the intro. Wouldn't that be great? Did you just say that this game was bad?
[2875.66s -> 2895.26s]  This game's bad? What? Here we go. Ted Talk. Today, we're going to talk about
[2895.26s -> 2907.03s]  setting goals. Here we go. My favorite fucking arcade. Caution, a memory card is required
[2907.03s -> 2913.75s]  in order to save Dynamite Cop data. Please select a door without a, yeah, it's this one.
[2915.13s -> 2928.81s]  Now prepare yourself for Dynamite Cop. We have a situation down there. Some modern day pirates
[2928.81s -> 2934.73s]  have hijacked a huge cruiser. They're holding 2,000 hostages inside, including the president's
[2934.73s -> 2940.73s]  daughter. We have to invade the ship, clear the pirates, and rescue the hostages, especially
[2940.73s -> 2949.70s]  the president's daughter. I'm on it. There ain't even no title screen. That's how good this game
[2949.70s -> 2957.56s]  is. You just go. Some of your favorite, some of your video games you like have fucking title
[2957.56s -> 2964.26s]  screens. Oh, there's, there's, I love this game so much. Here's the title screen. Never mind.
[2964.90s -> 2973.48s]  I'm going to beat this fucking game on stream. All right, let's go to other,
[2974.28s -> 2982.94s]  just for a second here. Options. Use what? Options. Every time you go into a beat-em-up
[2982.94s -> 2987.29s]  style game like this, you always want to make sure that you check to make sure that
[2987.29s -> 2990.65s]  there's no, you know what, I'm like the lowest amount of rests.
[2991.37s -> 2997.74s]  And some of you boomers will know what I'm talking about here. Dynamite Cop.
[2998.30s -> 3007.70s]  Ooh, there's more. Wait, there's two? This DLC campaign? I guess we're doing this one.
[3008.34s -> 3016.66s]  All right, I gotta pick. Wait, that guy, why does that guy have like a, I need to see
[3016.66s -> 3025.11s]  this. Wait, is this even the same? This is the same name. What? No, is this, is this
[3025.19s -> 3035.13s]  right? Am I, is this the right game? That guy has like a little animal on his shoulder.
[3035.77s -> 3049.00s]  Okay, I don't know what the controls are. Hold on. Where's kick? That's grab. Yep,
[3049.00s -> 3055.34s]  there's the suplex. That's kick. Okay, here we go. They all do the same scream when they die?
[3055.34s -> 3072.22s]  Yep, I remember. This is the tutorial mission. Yeah, it's different pitches of the same sound.
[3073.82s -> 3079.50s]  There's weapons, there's guns. I think there's quick time events too, if I remember.
[3080.38s -> 3098.38s]  Give me that. Come here, come here, come here. There's a gun. There's a turtle. Who's the
[3098.38s -> 3111.62s]  turtle guy? Wait, give me the soda. Yeah, it's a heal. I remember. I think I'm super mode right
[3111.62s -> 3128.18s]  now. DDT, double DDT, double DDT into a scoopslam. Can't get it out of that one. Anything else?
[3128.18s -> 3156.49s]  Let's go. The guns! If they have guns, you're in trouble. Captain Gonzalez. Oh boy.
[3157.53s -> 3165.35s]  Jump away, jump away, dash dash dash. I don't even, I got him. That's a power up.
[3166.31s -> 3179.18s]  Where is he going? Bazooka. Give me the airship missile. Oh, are they supposed to?
[3180.14s -> 3186.14s]  I just dropped a fucking nuke. Now I remember why they love this game so much.
[3187.82s -> 3199.78s]  Give me the lawn chair. Anybody else? No, that's the little mini boss. Give me the
[3199.78s -> 3220.78s]  heels though. This is in your face, fast paced. What? Why is she inside the suitcase?
[3221.82s -> 3224.46s]  This game was in arcades, but they kind of remade it.
[3232.36s -> 3236.36s]  So this was a die hard game, I think. It was in the arcade, they licensed it,
[3236.36s -> 3241.88s]  then they ported it to Dreamcast. Entirely different from what I understand. I could be
[3241.88s -> 3245.16s]  wrong and I might be remembering that completely incorrectly, but I think it is.
[3246.84s -> 3256.14s]  Anybody else? Fix the audio. What's going on with the audio?
[3259.32s -> 3273.38s]  Audio's fucked up? What do you mean? Out of sync? You're talking about like my voice to
[3273.38s -> 3285.24s]  the game or you're talking about like the game audio is not synced right now? It's the game
[3285.24s -> 3300.98s]  audio. Okay, hold on. So you're hearing sounds first. Oh, wait, kick! Got it. Now that sounds.
[3301.62s -> 3323.27s]  Oh fuck, he scoops lemon. His head's on sticks? Shit, he's got the head.
[3325.48s -> 3337.64s]  No, I don't want to die. There's different combinations you can do as well. Oh fuck.
[3338.44s -> 3344.47s]  Oh fuck. I believe, I believe like 80 and deep. Holy fuck, he's got a double.
[3351.35s -> 3366.01s]  Pick him up. Off the ground. Oh, I remember this. Oh, this game's so much fun. Hair sample?
[3366.01s -> 3383.58s]  What have we got? That's the end of that guy. I think I got a boss coming up here. Give me
[3383.58s -> 3395.69s]  the food. Stay up here. Is it a loaf of bread or is it a missile? I don't know.
[3396.65s -> 3422.01s]  Shit. It's a French roll. Stream saved. What happened? No, he doesn't have a gun. How do you
[3422.01s -> 3424.89s]  throw? Looks like there's a throw button I think where I can just with it.
[3426.09s -> 3436.46s]  Why the fuck did I throw this thing? I don't want to use the bread anymore. Get rid of it.
[3437.66s -> 3453.14s]  Why do I have an axe? Food. I need to eat. Eat the cake. What? Oh, throwing the cake at
[3454.10s -> 3483.29s]  the bread. Oh, fuck. Cake. Just eat it. Eat cake. There it is. Just lost all the health I just got.
[3487.08s -> 3517.32s]  He just linked me. Come on, man. You good? I'm good. Oh, the chef. The burners turn on.
[3517.32s -> 3534.92s]  I don't think they do. Food. Give me the apples. Just eat them. There's got to be more
[3534.92s -> 3540.66s]  food in here than just fucking god. He just throws dynamite in his own kitchen.
[3541.46s -> 3562.84s]  Oh, fuck. Crab walks back up. Any more food in here? Donkey Kong barrel. How many? I think I got
[3562.84s -> 3580.46s]  three continues. Give me more. I need more environmental stuff. Bridge? Those grenades?
[3581.50s -> 3597.05s]  Give me the grenades. Yep. You can't eat grenades, can you? Should be doing way more
[3597.05s -> 3609.77s]  damage. Shouldn't it? What else we got? Take the whole thing. Any more burners? All right,
[3609.77s -> 3616.50s]  back up, back up, back up, back up. Can I reach in here and grab anything? I don't think so.
[3617.14s -> 3635.53s]  I think I got all the environmental stuff out of the way. Oh, dropping frames again. It's
[3635.53s -> 3639.45s]  going to happen. Once this frame is over, I've got to make a few phone calls,
[3639.45s -> 3643.05s]  because this is the second day in a row. Well, second stream in a row where we've
[3643.05s -> 3651.14s]  had problems. So, going to have to get somebody else out here again. I'm not even
[3651.14s -> 3665.50s]  going to get up from that, I don't think. No, it's not. It's a profit with the internet
[3665.50s -> 3678.84s]  here. And it's very distracting. It's very annoying. I've got to get a full health pack, too.
[3681.53s -> 3684.01s]  Yeah, we'll probably drop like 50,000 frames this stream.
[3686.50s -> 3692.81s]  But, whatever. Not much I can do about it, unfortunately. This is dying my cock,
[3692.81s -> 3710.63s]  those of you wondering. That was not graceful at all. It just fell out of there.
[3713.08s -> 3716.30s]  Get him! He shouldn't be able to do that, that's not fair.
[3717.10s -> 3725.64s]  I still can't. All right, finally he comes up. Trying to aim at him.
[3730.39s -> 3747.27s]  Throw him this way. Is it really just getting worse? God.
[3749.11s -> 3767.78s]  It's like I still bet he died twice. This is a good gun. I think I can bounce him around.
[3770.18s -> 3791.27s]  Come here. So, it's hard to try to pay attention to two things at the same time.
[3792.31s -> 3799.90s]  Is it like, unwatchable? It seems just consistently not. And right when we get to
[3799.90s -> 3804.30s]  the crab enemies, really. You're gonna give me this internet bullshit when I'm doing one
[3804.30s -> 3808.54s]  of my favorite Dreamcast games with the fucking crabs. That's unbelievable.
[3811.29s -> 3863.43s]  Come here. Get him. Give me the piece of meat. 71 hundred fucking frames drop.
[3863.43s -> 3876.42s]  God damn, it's been one hour. Ah! So aggravating. Let's go. Take that suitcase.
[3877.14s -> 3896.94s]  Oh, I wasn't even... I just broke my fucking neck. I just... whatever.
[3925.24s -> 3931.74s]  Give me the black box. I'll stand on those.
[3933.42s -> 3945.96s]  No! I was trying to juggle him. Everybody wants the black box. So bad. Come here.
[3946.84s -> 3955.03s]  Is something in there still? There's still one missile left. Nice.
[3957.96s -> 3964.92s]  Really? Do I get infinite continues? I might get infinite continues. This is great.
[3965.80s -> 3981.35s]  It doesn't even matter how bad you are. Make sure you... a nuclear bomb does not get rid of
[3981.35s -> 3991.03s]  this guy. Two nukes. Okay, you're dead. I'm not gonna fail this one. I'm gonna be able to
[3991.03s -> 4009.74s]  pay attention. Hit him with a wrench! I told you, this game is insane. Plug?
[4016.22s -> 4027.53s]  Power, power, power. All right, I got power up. Right in the middle. I got boxing gloves.
[4036.36s -> 4060.55s]  Don't kill the octopus. The octopus has to die. Jump! Die! Help pack. Oh, you gotta see
[4060.55s -> 4076.55s]  this though. This is great. So I'm... I'm kind of confused. Are they not aware
[4077.51s -> 4083.75s]  that she's inside of the crate? And he just... he's bringing his just pink suitcase around.
[4083.75s -> 4101.69s]  He doesn't know that she's in there. I think that's what's going on. He just carries his
[4101.69s -> 4126.14s]  luggage everywhere apparently. That's a nice chicken in there. It's a monster rancher. Monster.
[4134.42s -> 4146.38s]  Dead. I can't go in there, but they can come out. Can I open this? I might be able
[4146.38s -> 4165.38s]  to break it. I need to do some more suplexes and stuff, but I don't know. I forget how to do them.
[4170.15s -> 4175.13s]  I wasn't trying to kill him. I was just trying... I was trying to open his crate.
[4175.69s -> 4192.28s]  Oh god. All right, come on down. I'll get you with the pendulum.
[4199.34s -> 4203.99s]  Where did you get the gun? You just have a pistol? How can you get...
[4205.19s -> 4208.55s]  You just pulled that out of nowhere. They split every time.
[4212.63s -> 4232.71s]  My god, that hurts. Don't even let him get up. That guy just tried to raid me.
[4233.43s -> 4241.66s]  Did he block the bullets with his hands?
[4255.10s -> 4273.14s]  Can I get Boko swords? I'm trying to do other moves. I remember this shitty game.
[4274.33s -> 4293.08s]  Shitty game. Who said this game was shitty? This is a classic slot machine. This is such
[4293.08s -> 4299.27s]  random shit in this game. I just got pizza. It's a hand toss. Let's get rid of this thing.
[4301.67s -> 4303.91s]  Oh, pepper. Can I eat the pepper?
[4308.97s -> 4323.69s]  He just makes him sneeze. What are those recovery moves?
[4326.26s -> 4329.86s]  That's like a horrible new trailer. Get pulled out of the room.
[4331.56s -> 4340.01s]  Okay, can I do something with this slot machine? Come on. Seven. Seven.
[4341.61s -> 4352.36s]  No! Do it again. Give me something cool. If he pulls it, does he get the whatever's in there?
[4357.77s -> 4377.37s]  No, I don't want to leave here without getting the jackpot. Here I come. No. Spin it again.
[4378.66s -> 4388.71s]  Do it again. The machine actually broke. Why? What the fuck? That's unfortunate.
[4389.59s -> 4412.25s]  Jervin has played Quiet Man and Dynamite Man, but this is Dynamite Cop. Two back-to-backs.
[4412.89s -> 4422.87s]  I gotta dump him into the ocean. I don't know why these were so much harder to do in the
[4422.87s -> 4436.68s]  arcade. Maybe it's because I was 14 or something. But I remember that was a big deal. Did I just
[4436.68s -> 4453.70s]  kick that guy into the balls? Bow and arrow is cool. Double machine guns?
[4455.22s -> 4460.70s]  Make sure you don't sharpen an axe with your hands, guys. That's a bad fucking idea.
[4472.36s -> 4501.02s]  Infinite continues! That was stylish. I sharpened my axes. I thought I could pick up the
[4501.02s -> 4504.25s]  mast. Sharpen my axes with my face.
[4521.58s -> 4524.81s]  All right, this guy. I was gonna say this guy shouldn't even let me.
[4530.12s -> 4543.42s]  No! He's breaking up my combos! You dick! Stop! Why is my combos breaking?
[4545.10s -> 4556.34s]  This way. Would you classify this game as a reverse Bayonetta?
[4556.98s -> 4560.18s]  The more damage I take, my clothes come off.
[4561.22s -> 4576.26s]  As an Bayonetta, the more damage you do, your clothes come off. Now you're doing this.
[4581.53s -> 4596.47s]  Dammit. That didn't work. Come here. Come here! Got it. Now it's time for the final boss. I'm ready.
[4603.80s -> 4610.22s]  He said, step on her head! You were in my suitcase! You threw my beach towels out of
[4610.22s -> 4627.40s]  there to get in there, didn't you? How did he change his body? Uh-oh, this is not gonna go well.
[4630.10s -> 4649.67s]  Standard combo. That's it. Where did he get the gun? He's shooting at his face.
[4651.50s -> 4658.17s]  That's wildly unfair. Watch out! How are you supposed to dodge that? This is the
[4658.17s -> 4664.44s]  way that they farm quarters. Yeah, I remember this. This is like the... I remember me and
[4664.44s -> 4668.84s]  my friend on the car ride, home of my mother's car, talking about to each other, back and forth.
[4668.84s -> 4672.92s]  Like, you know, arcades are so fucking stupid, man. That's like a way that they'd just be
[4672.92s -> 4676.04s]  guaranteed that they take quarters from you, because you're gonna die like five times.
[4678.92s -> 4691.08s]  I really had that conversation. Ask him! He lost his sword. See? Look.
[4694.60s -> 4697.88s]  All right, let's go, man! Come on! Don't let the continue go down! And then sometimes
[4697.88s -> 4700.76s]  you have to debate with your friend whether or not you want to put another quarter in.
[4700.76s -> 4704.52s]  You're... you both put like seven and a half dollars into the game, right?
[4705.99s -> 4709.59s]  And then the countdown is happening. If you don't continue, you start from the very beginning
[4709.59s -> 4712.55s]  again, and you have the debate with your buddy whether or not you want to move on to
[4712.55s -> 4717.43s]  a different game or you've got to finish this, we've got to beat it. And you have five fucking
[4717.43s -> 4736.12s]  seconds to figure it out. Oh no, he ripped off my clothes! Dodge, right? No, don't bring
[4736.20s -> 4766.79s]  back those memories. Got him. Great cutscene. I didn't skip it. A little smoking cigarette?
[4768.47s -> 4773.27s]  Why did she just kick me in the head? Wait, what was that traitor's shit in the end?
[4776.06s -> 4787.83s]  The island is still there. He didn't even get rid of the island.
[4787.83s -> 4791.11s]  Some other bad guy will take up shop in there.
[4791.11s -> 4812.04s]  There's two more chapters. Two more DLCs. Thank you for saving my life again.
[4812.04s -> 4819.88s]  Roundhouse kick to the part of your head where it's going to kill you, right? That heel went
[4819.88s -> 4825.00s]  directly into the back portion of my head where my skull connects to my neck. That is
[4825.00s -> 4838.66s]  dead. That is... you're dead. Is this supposed to be ominous that I lose?
[4847.29s -> 4854.98s]  It freezes at such a perfect time. All right, let's go. Let's try. Let's see the other campaigns.
[4860.09s -> 4863.05s]  Let's go. Let's go one, two, three right down the aisle here. Let's do a gene.
[4866.90s -> 4869.86s]  Back to the ring. No, I'm beating all these. Mission one, mission two.
[4873.38s -> 4901.30s]  Wait, this is the same mission. Oh, look at that kick though. Oh, the girl is great.
[4902.10s -> 4922.18s]  Gene Ivy is great. Look at these moves. Now I understand a few things about this game that
[4922.18s -> 4926.06s]  I didn't understand before. The thing that I understand is one.
[4938.22s -> 4942.95s]  Yeah, that's the whole game. But what's the other one though? What's the showdown one?
[4943.67s -> 4952.30s]  This game is like 40... this game's not even 30 minutes long. They were just farming
[4952.30s -> 4957.62s]  quarters. Oh, I just want everyone to do me a quick favor and just remember just how much
[4957.62s -> 4964.76s]  money this game was. I severely underestimated just how much content was in this game.
[4964.76s -> 4980.42s]  I think this game was like somewhere around a hundred dollars to get. I think. Oops. It's like
[4980.42s -> 4987.14s]  a very rare Dreamcast game and I thought it was going to be like... I'm keeping it and
[4987.14s -> 4997.30s]  guess what? It's an asset now and it's going to appreciate the value. And then 30 more years
[4998.02s -> 5004.18s]  I will give Dynamite Cup to somebody in my family. Hey, check out this Dreamcast system.
[5004.74s -> 5019.85s]  All these are going to appreciate the value. No, get the... This is different. No, this is
[5019.85s -> 5035.10s]  different. This is different, guys. It is. It's different. Yeah, it's the same enemies
[5035.10s -> 5049.77s]  but you fight them in different sequences. Can you get hit by those? The power-ups,
[5049.77s -> 5063.11s]  come on. P, P, P, P, P, P, P. Yeah, this didn't happen in the last game. The same cutscenes?
[5070.23s -> 5072.39s]  This time she's under the bed, not in the suitcase.
[5075.13s -> 5083.54s]  Different variations of the cutscene. Procedurally generated. Procedurally generated
[5083.54s -> 5097.96s]  hiding girl. That's good. Okay, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme. No, gimme, gimme, gimme. No,
[5097.96s -> 5106.68s]  I don't want the spear. You sissy. No! I have a lighter. What does a lighter do?
[5107.32s -> 5113.90s]  There's gotta be one that cycles between items, right? Let's see if I can grab him.
[5117.58s -> 5140.18s]  He died. Let's see what it just does. Just uppercut. In the bathroom? Yeah,
[5140.18s -> 5142.18s]  okay. These are new environments, guys.
[5142.98s -> 5166.90s]  I'm trying to do my best impression.
[5210.30s -> 5228.06s]  Hey, I'm available for consultation work. It's a deep cough.
[5248.06s -> 5253.35s]  Sneeze herself to death. I told you sneezes are very dangerous.
[5254.87s -> 5283.16s]  Uh oh. Oh god, the clothes are coming off. For those of you guys that are wondering,
[5283.16s -> 5287.48s]  I'm gonna move to the next game. This was very expensive, so I'm gonna get,
[5289.00s -> 5292.74s]  I'm gonna get my money's worth, because I want to play through the game.
[5293.93s -> 5298.49s]  I can't just play this for five, ten minutes and then go on. No, I wanna get, I hate,
[5298.49s -> 5309.22s]  I wanna get my money's worth. I don't remember what jump is. All right, here we go.
[5309.22s -> 5315.86s]  It's the, is this the same? This is not the same boss. This is a different boss.
[5329.48s -> 5335.45s]  It's, I'm so confused. All right, give me the fish. Can I eat it? Oh, that's a lot of tuna.
[5338.54s -> 5345.77s]  Somebody count the deaths from the last, anybody have an opportunity to do that?
[5346.65s -> 5356.06s]  How many times did I die last time? Because we're gonna determine how expensive this was.
[5356.78s -> 5365.82s]  We'll see if it's the same amount of money that it was on Amazon. Those grenades.
[5373.08s -> 5379.26s]  No way, no way, did you see that combo? He's going to Evo next weekend.
[5380.92s -> 5405.21s]  Evo's in August. Evo next weekend. Let's see, where, where, where is she now?
[5407.53s -> 5412.49s]  Under the bed, in the suitcase. Hanging somewhere, like from the rafters or something,
[5412.49s -> 5424.66s]  like peeking over the rafters. Still not graceful.
[5429.58s -> 5430.86s]  I just arrested that person.
[5433.50s -> 5454.10s]  How did I do that? I don't know how to, how did I arrest that person? Pizza, pizza face.
[5459.85s -> 5475.61s]  What would you rob? You can only do that with a handgun.
[5479.46s -> 5482.66s]  Empty your pockets. You're, you're not only, not only are you under arrest,
[5482.74s -> 5499.22s]  but I want the money in your wallet. Empty your pockets, pizza face. That's a little wild.
[5500.02s -> 5520.41s]  And then, perhaps this time, they are sharks. Still aquatic in nature, but not,
[5523.05s -> 5538.58s]  not in the land. He slid. Don't start singing the baby shark thing.
[5539.54s -> 5565.02s]  That was unbelievable. That was essentially breaking every bone. Baby shark. Why would
[5565.02s -> 5570.06s]  you say that? I didn't say it, somebody else did, and I just, let's go, applied to it.
[5571.42s -> 5578.04s]  Still under the bed. Okay, still under the bed.
[5582.14s -> 5590.63s]  Can we not get her out? I am really confused, because they took her in the
[5590.71s -> 5598.44s]  suitcase last time, so she's still. No, I want to freeze.
[5601.77s -> 5627.91s]  Assholes. So many broken bones. This person is not. Have I died a few times in this one?
[5628.87s -> 5642.81s]  Just give me the nuclear bombs. It's fun to shoot these in here,
[5642.81s -> 5652.15s]  knowing that only one of them will blow up the whole island. Don't shoot.
[5652.15s -> 5677.05s]  I said no, Luigi, because he has a green costume on.
[5683.90s -> 5704.34s]  Still the same octopus encounter. No, no, dodge it. That's why I need friends
[5704.34s -> 5709.22s]  to play. Somebody distracts the squid while other people fight it.
[5710.18s -> 5713.02s]  It looks like it could hit the head, too.
[5715.02s -> 5725.78s]  There's guns over here. Give me the other, whatever this is.
[5727.14s -> 5733.93s]  Oh, the July popsicle thing. What are you dropping from the ceiling? Is it gonna blast
[5733.93s -> 5761.38s]  them? The squid wants to fight you. Well, it's happening. Super deep talk. I love it.
[5761.38s -> 5775.72s]  Can I arrest the squid? No. Imagine you could put his arms behind his back.
[5776.44s -> 5799.91s]  Wait. Ooh. Now what do we have here? Don't move. I was under the bed, too. I was also hiding.
[5800.47s -> 5821.77s]  Where did that guy come from? Oh, that was so hard. That was so hard. Even more casino games.
[5821.77s -> 5853.22s]  Good. Well, we found the speedrun character. You just need a handgun. What's this? Coin bucket?
[5854.18s -> 5855.62s]  Oh, the casino.
[5865.34s -> 5869.53s]  This is back when casinos still had, like, coin buckets, isn't it?
[5872.94s -> 5882.86s]  Break his neck. I'm dead.
[5888.97s -> 5895.16s]  Throw this away. How do you? I wish I just threw. I'm not sure there is. All right, arrest.
[5898.26s -> 5908.17s]  You're under arrest. My god. Why do you have reach across the whole map?
[5909.13s -> 5929.42s]  Yes. You're on. Now I can't even arrest them. Caution. I missed the top.
[5930.86s -> 5948.42s]  That was awesome. There's another one. There goes Nat Pagel. Those guys are just bringing
[5948.42s -> 5956.66s]  booze to a party. You get these last little snippets. You just stabbed him in the
[5956.66s -> 5983.34s]  fucking skull with this. No. Give me the gun. Arrest.
[5986.78s -> 6014.25s]  Come with that. Can I pick up the piano? That's unfortunate. Maybe I can break it.
[6018.33s -> 6025.58s]  When you get powers up, you get extra moves. That's good.
[6032.78s -> 6056.20s]  Piano. Give me that. You died before I could do anything. Don't shoot me.
[6066.15s -> 6080.71s]  Only have four continues left. Same guy. Stupid fools. Your captain is long dead.
[6081.59s -> 6097.22s]  He's fish bait by now. I'm so broken up by that. I only have four. I only have four
[6097.22s -> 6102.68s]  continues left. You're right. Is that for real? Shit, it is real. All right. No more.
[6102.68s -> 6125.91s]  I can't fucking run. I actually have to beat this. What the fuck? That was unbelievable.
[6141.77s -> 6149.22s]  Ah. Oh, come on. What's the stamina bars? Why do you have a bigger stamina bar than me?
[6150.18s -> 6161.34s]  Yeah, you're trying to fucking farm coins from me. That's not what I want to pick up.
[6162.38s -> 6168.06s]  Rhinoblast in coming.
[6181.54s -> 6205.53s]  Three continues. No. I tried to dodge it. I'm trying to get away from you when you do that.
[6205.53s -> 6241.13s]  No. He gets like a guaranteed hit. Give me the cheats. I got the cheats.
[6243.77s -> 6268.30s]  It's gonna spin again. No, he's not. Back suplex him. Throw him over the... What the fuck was
[6268.30s -> 6293.54s]  that? He just shoved a meatball out of his eye. Right in the face. No. Yep, you gotta hit him.
[6297.56s -> 6317.10s]  One credit left. I can't fuck this up. Just play it safe. That's not safe. I just did.
[6330.71s -> 6345.19s]  See the new ending. Thank you for saving my life again. Okay. Wait a minute. He's done.
[6347.58s -> 6369.54s]  What? What a hacker. There's no way. Okay. To double click on your desktop and open up
[6369.54s -> 6375.96s]  hackprogram.exe, it'd probably take... You ever opened up Photoshop? A program that's that
[6375.96s -> 6395.88s]  elaborate. It's gonna take like 30 to 40 seconds to open. There it is. What is this
[6395.96s -> 6404.98s]  game and how do I play it? This is... Dynamite Cop is for the Dreamcast. It's only on Dreamcast.
[6404.98s -> 6408.82s]  There's only two ways you could possibly play this game. You have to get a Dreamcast
[6410.41s -> 6418.90s]  or you have to emulate the game. And emulation is fairly difficult, but it was really the
[6418.90s -> 6432.65s]  only two possible ways to play it. All right, here we go. Game over. Emulation is fine.
[6432.65s -> 6443.10s]  Um, it really depends on what emulator because I've tried to use like PS2 era plus PS3 era
[6443.66s -> 6449.59s]  emulators before. And they're not quite there yet. They function and some of them
[6449.59s -> 6454.33s]  function fairly well, but for the sake of making sure that there's no problems,
[6456.54s -> 6465.50s]  I've emulated before and it just doesn't work out well. All right, we got... We're
[6465.50s -> 6473.80s]  gonna try... Well, we're gonna do the last mission. We're gonna go to Eddie's and we're
[6473.80s -> 6489.06s]  gonna do mission three. So this is from underwater. The only emulated games that you
[6489.06s -> 6496.10s]  physically own. That's pretty much how it works. Plus, I like having the actual physical thing
[6496.10s -> 6505.98s]  here. Having a Dreamcast or having a PlayStation 2 is... Can I ride that?
[6519.96s -> 6525.64s]  Why do I only get four credits? What's with the four credits? You seeing that?
[6525.64s -> 6551.48s]  I gotta play well. Are they alive or... Yeah, I guess it actually is hard mode.
[6554.18s -> 6558.82s]  All right, I got super and I got the gun. No, why did you... Why did you do that?
[6561.13s -> 6595.61s]  Animation death. This... Over the rail. This from this early? Isn't this just like
[6595.61s -> 6609.62s]  more than halfway through? Ah, shit. I'm not supposed to get hit. Oh, bad positioning.
[6610.26s -> 6636.84s]  Oh, I didn't catch it. Some tryhard fancy for real. Because I don't... I want to do this.
[6637.80s -> 6645.19s]  I want to get to the end. It's three different sequences. Plays out three different ways.
[6646.63s -> 6652.44s]  We'll find out for real here. Hurry up with that bomb. And where is that girl?
[6654.20s -> 6667.51s]  She got out. All right, she's sneaking around now. Oh no, he's here. I wasn't ready.
[6669.40s -> 6686.36s]  What is this? Umbrella. She's dead. I need every heal. All right, I'm almost at full health.
[6686.36s -> 6712.36s]  No credits can be used. Pretty much full health. Good. No, what? Nopes. Weight room.
[6712.36s -> 6731.90s]  Pick up the bike machine. Yeah, those don't weigh like 4,000 pounds or anything.
[6732.78s -> 6739.93s]  Guy just got out of the sauna. You're never ready for a fight when you get out of the sauna.
[6740.57s -> 6763.38s]  The guy brings two guns into the sauna. Relax. They're hard days work. I love the
[6763.38s -> 6771.58s]  poster in the back. It's a beautiful poster. This dude's got the best combos. Seems like it.
[6772.30s -> 6784.79s]  So what's the chef going to be? Because we're about to fight the chef. And we're going to
[6784.79s -> 6808.28s]  see what is inside of there now. Twist. All right. Back. Give me the... what are they?
[6808.36s -> 6820.41s]  Pork buns? Oh, these are mine. No, shit. They don't even heal as much as you're gonna hit one time.
[6828.20s -> 6856.63s]  Let's go. Come here. No. Load a clip into the axe. Oh, I ran right into it.
[6872.57s -> 6891.13s]  All right, you good? These guys do a lot. The dual welders do a lot of damage. Like that.
[6891.13s -> 6912.12s]  I'm just getting poked. Those are tiny pokes. Do you have... is there a heal over here? There is.
[6913.98s -> 6942.90s]  Health. Get it. All right. What is the chef? It's...
[6953.74s -> 6962.25s]  there's no way you're gonna be able to stun lock me over here. You probably can. That's
[6962.25s -> 6996.07s]  dog shit. Come on. Right into the fucking camera. Oh, don't crap walk over here. How
[6996.07s -> 7009.72s]  did you not get hit by any of those? No. No credits. Come on. There's a drink right there.
[7011.00s -> 7041.86s]  Barely even healing me. Got it. All right. Watch out. There we go. I'll get him here.
[7042.66s -> 7069.11s]  Block every single punch. There we go. One credit down. Where's girl?
[7069.59s -> 7078.47s]  Haven't you found her yet? Never mind. It's time. Blow it up. Activate the bomb.
[7083.02s -> 7088.92s]  No sign of the girl somehow. Gotta utilize this.
[7095.18s -> 7129.22s]  One dead. Both dead. Move. Can't pick that up. That's weird. I'm trying so hard.
[7129.22s -> 7158.87s]  All right. One more and I get the power. Why... okay. Oh, he's the liar. He's the liar.
[7159.91s -> 7174.95s]  That's awesome. That was so cool. I'm glad we got to see it. I didn't screw it up.
[7176.23s -> 7192.17s]  I have a lighter. Holy shit. No! That was so cool. There's a lot of damage probably.
[7192.25s -> 7201.94s]  Come on. It doesn't feel like it's doing that much damage.
[7204.82s -> 7228.10s]  No! God damn! I think I don't want that right now. I don't want to pick that up.
[7229.14s -> 7234.55s]  I think it's a waste. I'd rather save that for like a boss or a hard encounter.
[7236.49s -> 7258.50s]  Okay. Come up with a broom. Come on. Why do you have so... this guy has so much health.
[7259.46s -> 7267.27s]  Okay. It's looking good. There's only one major boss left and it's the last guy.
[7268.23s -> 7286.15s]  This way. No, actually there's two bosses. These cutscenes are ridiculous.
[7290.98s -> 7299.94s]  They're so quick. Why'd you just hit me in the face?
[7307.70s -> 7328.54s]  Dead? No. I need the health. I need it. I have to take it. Give it to me. You stupid
[7328.54s -> 7346.54s]  fucking game. That's okay. It's actually pretty good here. This is not going to be
[7346.54s -> 7371.66s]  good. This ain't looking good. Puffing. Is that going to dodge quicker than that?
[7372.30s -> 7385.37s]  This guy's actually worse than any of the other bosses I think. Just because he's so big.
[7398.12s -> 7404.73s]  Okay. You got a health pack? You don't. Oh, you're so annoying. You have to have one.
[7416.34s -> 7452.87s]  What? Christ. Oh my god. The helicopter flew by twice. Can I rest? You can. That's a
[7452.87s -> 7464.66s]  strat. Get it. Wow. I can't be standing on top of something. Is that what the problem is?
[7480.55s -> 7487.22s]  All right. Is that a heal? Dollar bill. What do you do with a dollar bill?
[7497.78s -> 7508.50s]  This will be so easy. He can't teleport away. These guys are so horrible. Okay.
[7510.84s -> 7517.35s]  Really? Did I just get... Oh, the thing sticks out. You can't do it to the guy with
[7517.35s -> 7546.62s]  two swords, unfortunately. God damn it. How did you even... I just hit you in the fucking
[7546.62s -> 7572.65s]  face with a spear. How do you keep scooping me? I'm scared Jeremy. Hurry up.
[7574.89s -> 7578.39s]  Can I rest the crabs? Probably not. Nope.
[7578.39s -> 7592.74s]  Give me this. Come on. Oh, there's another hand gun back here.
[7595.30s -> 7603.59s]  Come on. This is back here. Fire axe.
[7609.32s -> 7640.54s]  He's dead. Come on. Give me something from the slot machine. Good. Good. Come on before it
[7640.54s -> 7654.82s]  drains. This is it. This guy and then we go up to the top and we fight the last boss.
[7654.82s -> 7674.23s]  I just need to be very careful. I don't have an actual gun to rest. That would help a lot right
[7674.23s -> 7699.86s]  now. Guns. Don't they gonna shoot? Oh, there's nowhere to go. There's two of them on the
[7699.86s -> 7717.93s]  ground. Head in the head in the head in the head. How many times do I have to shoot you
[7717.93s -> 7726.01s]  in the head? All right. I got the power for the boss. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's
[7726.01s -> 7741.48s]  go. Let's go. It's different this time. He was down twice in a row. Stupid fools. Your captain
[7741.48s -> 7750.84s]  is long dead. He's fish bait by now. Another combo with the axe. Forget it. Just take him down.
[7750.84s -> 7757.90s]  I can do it. Come on. I just gotta get it. Don't. That's almost three combos and he's
[7757.90s -> 7768.54s]  almost dead. That's it. And I got. Give me the special. Yes. All right. I'm ready to go.
[7778.65s -> 7787.88s]  One credit. He's gonna dodge at the right time. And I got a special.
[7790.68s -> 7802.73s]  All right. Dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge. Watch out. He's gonna kick.
[7807.32s -> 7827.14s]  Kick. Oh. Get out of here. Get out of here. Good to see the last cut scene.
[7831.62s -> 7839.69s]  Thank you for saving my life again. All right. How does this one play out?
[7841.88s -> 7856.89s]  He's dead. Arguably the worst one. That was the worst one. It just explodes. I think they
[7856.89s -> 7872.70s]  got him right at the time. First impressions? Um. I mean it's not first impressions. I played
[7872.70s -> 7879.69s]  this game. My first impressions 15, 16 years ago were I'm gonna burn $20 in this machine.
[7880.41s -> 7900.20s]  But wait. Hold on now. Is it after credits scene? Well now you just burned 100. I don't
[7900.20s -> 7916.54s]  think this one was that much. Post credits? This one was like 70 maybe. Or like 60. There's
[7916.54s -> 7928.17s]  no post credits scene. You said 100? It probably was. I don't know. I'm just trying to make myself
[7928.17s -> 7942.73s]  feel better. Uh. Did I unlock the? Well did you take a look at that? Showdown. I was so
[7942.73s -> 7957.51s]  good at the game. Um. Fast. I kind of like the combos with Eddie. Oh. Mission. You are
[7957.51s -> 7964.31s]  hurt. Do not wait. Weapon. Uh. This is just hard mode. Weapons, hits cause more damage than normal.
[7964.31s -> 7968.47s]  You are hurt. Do not take any more damage. Get to the next scene before time runs out.
[7969.99s -> 7976.04s]  So this is you one hit and you're dead. This is you. Everything does more damage and this is time.
[7976.04s -> 7992.33s]  Go! Move it! Apparently we're doing this one. Let's see what happens. 30 seconds to get the-
[7992.33s -> 7996.47s]  Is it? Do I have 30 seconds to beat the game? How is that possible? It's got a time
[7996.47s -> 8005.08s]  crisis isn't it? Let me just see what happens. Okay so we have 16 seconds.
[8007.24s -> 8024.04s]  I'm just curious. Yeah all right. So you have a certain amount of time to beat every screen.
[8024.84s -> 8032.33s]  That was fun. That was dynamite. Cough. Classic. I'm glad I played through it a few times.
[8032.33s -> 8036.33s]  I'm gonna go ahead and turn this off so I don't like hurt anybody's eyes or anything.
[8039.90s -> 8053.11s]  Next up we've got. What do we got? There are a few options. We could do another survival horror.
[8053.91s -> 8060.82s]  We could do- all right. There's three categories guys. There's game actually good,
[8062.06s -> 8073.74s]  survival horror, or stupid. That's pretty much what's available. Do you want to go through a
[8073.74s -> 8079.98s]  stupid one? All right okay okay wait okay yeah we just did the ring. That was survival horror.
[8080.62s -> 8085.98s]  Then we did dynamite cop which is good. So now we're gonna go with the floygan brothers.
[8086.78s -> 8113.38s]  Which I'm assuming is really stupid. The floygan brothers. Did somebody just get 50 subs?
[8115.96s -> 8134.25s]  The Olaf won thanks for the 50 community subs. My god. Thank you so much the Olaf.
[8136.65s -> 8142.01s]  Visual concept. I don't like this company. I don't- what? I'm being taunted.
[8163.42s -> 8171.46s]  Good floygan brothers. Episode one. Why how is this episode one? Is this a whole series? Is
[8171.46s -> 8179.40s]  this a tv show? But honestly thank you so much Olaf for the massive amount of community subs.
[8180.20s -> 8191.62s]  That's fucking crazy. It's Ed, Ed and Eddie Mario Brothers and uh the walking dead had a-
[8191.62s -> 8194.66s]  no it's not. The walking dead.
[8199.56s -> 8203.24s]  Oh
[8220.22s -> 8223.82s]  what's a seven-letter word that means circles of sugary baked dough
[8223.82s -> 8228.42s]  with chocolate chips in them. Cookies. Let's make cookies.
[8230.02s -> 8234.33s]  We're gonna make cookies. We need sugar. Pass me the sugar bowl big brother.
[8234.41s -> 8235.77s]  It's on the table. It's a pretty good show.
[8237.37s -> 8245.96s]  We need sugar. Do I just make the cookies? I move around. I get to be- I'm the- I'm the small
[8245.96s -> 8252.86s]  floy- yeah okay. You can already read the comments. Sugar makes cookies good. Of course.
[8253.42s -> 8268.18s]  Uh I need the sugar. Where was it? Right here? Reach the sugar. God,
[8268.18s -> 8277.62s]  Freudian weapon tank community subs. Thank you, Freudian weapon tank. Ten more.
[8284.14s -> 8293.00s]  I better be tall enough to open this door. I'm gonna say no way.
[8298.33s -> 8306.44s]  I thought I was Floygan. Oh no wait it's it's it's Hoygan? Hoygal Floygan?
[8307.40s -> 8312.47s]  Hoygal Floygan and what's the big brother's name?
[8328.18s -> 8333.62s]  I think yeah that that is a talented voice actor by the way. That's Frank- was Frank Welker?
[8335.62s -> 8345.48s]  Moygal and Hoygal Floygan.
[8364.76s -> 8380.02s]  That's their catchphrase. I'm gonna make him dizzy and then jump on his belly.
[8381.86s -> 8405.62s]  That didn't work. There you go. Moygal. I'm gonna- I'm gonna jump if you keep playing this. Don't.
[8406.34s -> 8421.91s]  Easy. You wanted stupid and I knew this was going to be the worst one of the entire bundle.
[8421.91s -> 8424.23s]  This is the worst game that I've that I've purchased. The worst one.
[8427.74s -> 8430.86s]  That's not true. This is Dreamcast exclusive. You can't get this anywhere else.
[8431.34s -> 8442.73s]  Okay there are- hug.
[8457.67s -> 8463.77s]  So what's the inevitable issue that they both have to solve together instead of just baking
[8463.77s -> 8473.27s]  cookies and being weirdos? The aliens land, the military shows up with the rifles or something.
[8473.27s -> 8479.13s]  Like what? What is it? The aliens have the radar gun. What is it?
[8487.24s -> 8497.13s]  It sounds like Otto from Otto's Big Adventure. I'm getting flashback.
[8500.79s -> 8510.14s]  Get to cookie. Where's the oven mitt? The cookies are burning. I gotta get the oven.
[8514.31s -> 8544.81s]  Where's- is it in here? Cookie. The house is gonna burn down. I don't know where it is.
[8544.81s -> 8557.96s]  Moygal. Where is it? Up here? This is gonna burn.
[8560.18s -> 8580.26s]  Hoygal. Hoygal the kitchen's on fire. It burns. Go let's get in here again. He's dead.
[8599.22s -> 8600.02s]  That's all right.
[8605.30s -> 8608.18s]  So this is- I anger my little brother and he tries to hurt me.
[8608.74s -> 8630.57s]  What? This is- brother's fighting. What happened to the cookies? It wasn't- what we're having a fun
[8630.57s -> 8642.52s]  time? We're killing each other. You burnt my cookies. Now I'm going to beat your face in.
[8643.24s -> 8676.94s]  Call the cops. What's he doing? Here he comes. What does this even do? Well it stops him
[8676.94s -> 8679.58s]  from hurting me because I stand on like the don't hurt- what?
[8679.58s -> 8701.03s]  What? Offer Moygal an apple when he's hungry. This is such a confusing brother relationship here.
[8704.73s -> 8710.94s]  I have to teach him. What are the options to teach? Let's see. Teach high five.
[8713.70s -> 8722.50s]  I did- why did I- I lost points. Moygal will high five with one hand or ten
[8722.50s -> 8726.66s]  with both hands. Use the analog stick to choose up down right or left and press
[8726.66s -> 8732.02s]  five for one hand or ten for two. Press go to start a help for-
[8743.32s -> 8745.32s]  This is the oddest game I think I've ever played.
[8746.84s -> 8754.62s]  So this actually was not the precursor to some larger scale story.
[8762.82s -> 8765.06s]  I'm very interested though. I need to see how this plays out.
[8765.06s -> 8778.54s]  So I taught him how to high five. Why is somebody like this using the oven?
[8778.54s -> 8810.68s]  What does he want? How many points should I give him? Ten? Nine? Five? Nine. Does anybody
[8810.68s -> 8825.53s]  understand what the hell is happening right now? He wants three. We're giving each other points.
[8826.49s -> 8837.26s]  That's not a place where you should have- wait, hold on. He just pulled- what is that? I don't
[8837.26s -> 8858.23s]  think I want to touch that. What the fuck? This is not gonna go anywhere. This goes in a
[8858.23s -> 8885.62s]  circle, Moygan. Oh no! Moygal has lost control of the train. Run and dive to catch the handle
[8885.62s -> 8911.10s]  at the back of Moygal's train. I don't have- I really don't have anything to say.
[8912.06s -> 8935.11s]  How do I get on the train? At the back? But the camera doesn't let me-
[8937.85s -> 8958.12s]  Where are the parents? How old are they? They're like 40 and you're learning how to high five
[8958.12s -> 8991.69s]  at 40? What do you mean before it's too late? I'm not sure what too late means. I'm not fast
[8991.77s -> 9009.88s]  enough to follow and he- my fucking god. I can't. You're going too fast. No, get off the ladder.
[9019.66s -> 9039.66s]  Just fall off at this point. The camera can't be moved. And then we can go make cookies.
[9041.74s -> 9065.27s]  I got it. That's how the adventure starts. They haven't been out of their house.
[9065.27s -> 9070.47s]  They have no idea what the outside world looks like. They get like dropped off here
[9070.47s -> 9080.30s]  with like a bunch of cookie batter. You've completed your Floydgan Brothers training.
[9081.18s -> 9085.66s]  Now on to the main episode. Moygal's secret project. Have fun playing games with Moygal.
[9086.46s -> 9108.44s]  Here he comes. This is why we waited that long. He just picks him up and starts eating him.
[9121.06s -> 9123.70s]  Is there a whole open world here?
[9123.94s -> 9128.97s]  I'm not gonna tell you. You got me again. Grab the lettuce.
[9147.56s -> 9152.82s]  What are you building in there? What scary twisted fucking
[9152.82s -> 9155.54s]  messed up device are you building inside of that shack?
[9155.54s -> 9162.04s]  You want to help me? You can help me find these seven things. It's part of the surprise.
[9162.04s -> 9163.64s]  He wants a muffler oil.
[9164.68s -> 9169.19s]  House friends? You talk to mice now? Go now, big brother, go.
[9169.19s -> 9171.99s]  No surprise without you, so just- He wants like kerosene and shit.
[9171.99s -> 9178.52s]  What the hell are you doing in here, man? That's my little brother. He talks to rodent.
[9178.52s -> 9189.53s]  Uh-uh. Rope. Syringe. Moygal meets Hoygal's help to find seven parts to finish his secret
[9189.53s -> 9194.79s]  project. Watch out. When Moygal's mood changes, they might be something new to do. Don't forget
[9194.79s -> 9211.85s]  that the mice can help find things. All right. Wait. This is Pac-Man. This is the Pac-Man Adventures.
[9218.42s -> 9224.84s]  It's just from a third point perspective. This is unbelievable. Okay. Hold on. How does it work?
[9226.47s -> 9232.55s]  All right. Go cry in that box. I'm gonna get Moygal sad.
[9232.71s -> 9236.71s]  I got better things to do. Okay. What do you- what do you like, Moygal?
[9237.88s -> 9247.53s]  Can you like take care of this? Beat him up. No, that makes him mad, not sad.
[9248.09s -> 9266.15s]  All right. We got some- Man. The mailbox. Is this one- is this anger? No, this is unconscious.
[9266.95s -> 9274.87s]  Hey, come here. Let me get to the mailbox. I will. Just a second. Just pass out here for
[9274.87s -> 9287.96s]  one second. Can I get over here? How can I maybe jump on him more than once?
[9289.59s -> 9298.02s]  Bounce, bounce. This is kind of interesting. It is, apparently. This is actually pretty
[9298.02s -> 9305.34s]  interesting. It is. I'm not sure how to get up there. Is there a double jump?
[9307.50s -> 9318.74s]  No. Huh. Maybe I need to maybe be closer. I was gonna be angry.
[9328.82s -> 9333.78s]  All right. That's fine. Come on. Follow me. Let's go to the mailbox. Is this the mailbox?
[9339.98s -> 9345.54s]  Mice, can you help me out here? What do I need? Look. Well, there's the yellow switch. Thanks,
[9345.54s -> 9365.48s]  mice. Hey, there's an item over there, Gerbil. Okay. Oh my god. Fruit? Oh, he eats these,
[9365.48s -> 9381.54s]  right? Will this make him happy? This is not gonna make him sad. Food? Wait, food is repulsive.
[9386.02s -> 9400.79s]  Are you gonna eat it? I'm offering you an apple. There really is something fucked up going on here.
[9405.70s -> 9411.86s]  I don't like help your strange brother build a dangerous thing in the shed. I don't like that.
[9411.86s -> 9431.67s]  I don't like this game. Okay. Well, we got the box. Five points, though, right? Let's see.
[9431.67s -> 9446.36s]  Teach. What can I teach? Teach, lift up, R the W. Round the world yo-yo. Let's teach.
[9448.46s -> 9462.17s]  Teach him the F word. Uh, how are you doing? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Cancel.
[9464.06s -> 9475.24s]  Teach around the world yo-yo. Ten points. I just had a piece of fruit right next to you.
[9482.02s -> 9487.35s]  Oh, I'm gonna make him cry. Come here. Where's the cry box?
[9488.15s -> 9500.66s]  Come here. Let's go. We're gonna make him cry and then he's gonna open the cry box. Sure.
[9508.68s -> 9532.09s]  Come on. Got it. He's filling the river because he's crying. All right. You want to play a game?
[9532.09s -> 9537.77s]  What was the game you want to play? Play. We could play high five. Hide and seek. Running
[9537.77s -> 9548.55s]  a race. Catch. I don't want to play high five. This is boring. Yeah, I know how to play.
[9548.55s -> 9559.96s]  I'm an expert at this point. But this is giving me points.
[9559.96s -> 9572.34s]  Yeah, this is not based on some original cartoon. This is just the game.
[9578.42s -> 9584.42s]  There is no... but this is episode one. I'm gonna assume that they thought maybe
[9585.62s -> 9589.70s]  there was a possibility that this would take off and they could make a bunch of stuff.
[9589.70s -> 9601.38s]  Toys, TV shows. It's based on every cartoon. That is true. What is this? Oh, it's candy.
[9601.38s -> 9633.70s]  Come here. Here. Come here. Eat the candy. No points. Here. I was trying to throw it in his face.
[9634.50s -> 9665.21s]  Whatever. All right. All right. Anger. Here we go. Get the key. I'll be... all right. It's
[9665.21s -> 9671.74s]  time to be fair. You ready to be fair? For a game that came out like 20 years ago.
[9672.46s -> 9678.84s]  It was Dreamcast exclusive. That sucks. This is a great game. Like this... imagine 20 years ago.
[9679.72s -> 9698.09s]  I thought that said Moegle's Children. I'm like, why? What is there? Why is this here?
[9698.89s -> 9706.97s]  I was like, what the fuck? Oh my god. Oh, I gotta get out of this game.
[9715.66s -> 9724.79s]  Like from back here. It's so blurry. I just... all right. What are we doing? You want to...
[9724.79s -> 9745.64s]  I had the plant already. I threw the plant. Where did it go? Did it come down here?
[9750.57s -> 9762.97s]  What's this emotion over this way? Happy? Yeah, that's happy. Is he happy now? Did you know
[9762.97s -> 9768.17s]  that the Texas Chainsaw film was based off of this? I didn't... you know, I didn't know that.
[9768.17s -> 9784.15s]  That's... punch. No, no, no, no. It's... I gotta teach you. Lift up. Hide and seek. I want to
[9784.15s -> 9807.35s]  teach you around the world. Right here. Eat this, then. Take it. All right, now we can learn.
[9808.65s -> 9832.38s]  Speak. Teach. Around the world. Floyd Gainesaw Massacre. I'm not sure what this does.
[9833.02s -> 9839.37s]  Isn't it around the world? You spin it around a circle? Why is he doing this?
[9839.37s -> 9863.90s]  Did he learn it? That's not around the world. Insult. Scores. Play. Teach. Did you
[9863.90s -> 9871.86s]  not do it? I guess that is what he did. Okay, how about... can we do it now? Can we play now?
[9872.82s -> 9887.06s]  No. No. We gotta... I'm almost... it's almost time to move on.
[9888.52s -> 9892.62s]  It's getting close. But I kind of want to see one last thing.
[9892.62s -> 9898.60s]  Do you think you could buy the rights to these characters?
[9900.44s -> 9914.44s]  No. I don't think so. Oh, it's because he has a full tummy. Okay, I get it.
[9927.18s -> 9929.42s]  Why do I have to bribe you with points to hug you?
[9935.43s -> 9938.39s]  It's a game... a competition that we're playing against each other.
[9939.19s -> 9949.30s]  All right, come on. Go, go, go, go, go, go. So what does this open?
[9961.67s -> 9988.76s]  Swipe? What am I supposed to grab? Oh, this water is like poison. All right,
[9988.76s -> 9994.52s]  I think that's enough of the Floydgan brothers. Keep... I can't keep playing this.
[9994.52s -> 9999.96s]  This is the... I don't... I can't play the Floydgan brothers for like another 30 minutes.
[10001.29s -> 10008.71s]  Keep playing. Oh, really? You want to see more Floydgan? This game sucks.
[10009.59s -> 10020.79s]  I'm... I didn't say that. More Floydgan. I did open this though. No, I didn't. Hey,
[10021.67s -> 10042.10s]  go get that. Go open the gate. You can't do it? We need more Floydgan.
[10044.79s -> 10046.87s]  No, you definitely don't want more Floydgan.
[10051.93s -> 10055.78s]  Okay, so somebody has to be standing here already. Stand here.
[10058.42s -> 10077.45s]  Get over here. Right there. I just got rejected. Gotta be fast like me. Okay, so I get it. Come
[10077.45s -> 10080.89s]  here. I'm gonna hug. I'm gonna open this gate. We're gonna see what's in here. Why am I still
[10080.89s -> 10091.82s]  playing Floydgan? No, let's hug. Let's hug. No, shit. I just punched him in the stomach.
[10095.77s -> 10099.45s]  The pulls are in. It's a steal. I don't have any... I can't bribe him. I used all my...
[10100.09s -> 10113.48s]  I used all my brother points. I gotta play... I have to play a game to build up points.
[10114.28s -> 10126.71s]  All right, we're almost done. Trust me. Spam the pull. No, no, no, no, no, no. We're gonna be...
[10128.95s -> 10131.72s]  Now it's a timer. It's a timer.
[10139.10s -> 10140.70s]  It's just some resident sleep.
[10143.98s -> 10146.54s]  That was one guy though. That was one guy.
[10157.13s -> 10159.93s]  He was trying to bait me. That was... I had one or two seconds to do that.
[10159.93s -> 10165.29s]  Now how many points did I get? One.
[10179.62s -> 10213.96s]  It'll be two. And then we can get in the gate. And then 25 seasons from now,
[10213.96s -> 10221.93s]  we're gonna find out what's in that basement. I've had the key around my neck for about
[10221.93s -> 10251.82s]  seven years now. Okay. Give me a hug. Let's go. Activate lever into the gate.
[10269.02s -> 10274.54s]  What? No, I don't want to do the... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[10274.54s -> 10300.68s]  What? Get in. Okay. There's a dog in here. Dog. Dog. Plus 500 viewers. Dog. There's a dog. Dog.
[10300.68s -> 10320.09s]  What the hell? Is he winding up a punch? All right. How do we play? Play with dog, right?
[10323.50s -> 10336.07s]  No, I don't want to punch... Oh my god. Here. Play ball with dog.
[10336.95s -> 10349.67s]  What's your thing, Wiggle? Yeah, I'm gonna throw this with a dog, Wiggle.
[10350.71s -> 10357.67s]  Run and dive to catch spits by the tail. Win by catching spits three times. Lose if the
[10357.67s -> 10376.28s]  timer runs out. Minus 500 viewers. We're almost done with Hoigl and Moigl. How many
[10376.28s -> 10390.36s]  times do I have to catch the dog? How many times do I have to do it once? How many times?
[10392.84s -> 10407.58s]  This is Super Mario.
[10422.97s -> 10441.00s]  Restore. That's Hoigl and Moigl. The Moigl Brothers. I don't even know what it was called.
[10441.00s -> 10450.52s]  It's called the Moigl Brothers. Now this one I am excited for. I can't wait to play this one.
[10451.16s -> 10456.38s]  I don't even think this is a Dreamcast exclusive. I just saw it and I said,
[10456.38s -> 10466.26s]  okay, I think I need to have this. I have to own this. It's not Crazy Taxi. It is,
[10468.42s -> 10474.25s]  you'll see. It's not Seaman. I had to return Seaman because they forgot to put the mic in
[10474.25s -> 10509.14s]  the box. This is ECW Anarchy Rules. I'm excited. Louder, louder. There's a dumpster
[10509.14s -> 10514.62s]  match in this. That's all I needed to see. That's the first thing I'm going to do,
[10514.62s -> 10528.86s]  and probably the last thing I'm going to do. ECW don't even exist anymore. It was absorbed
[10528.86s -> 10536.89s]  a long time ago. Blood and guts. They used to throw each other on fluorescent light bulbs.
[10537.69s -> 10553.72s]  They used to jump off buildings. That guy actually hit the head with a rock.
[10554.28s -> 10570.90s]  And then it fell to his hand. Okay, all right. I think we get the idea. This fat
[10570.90s -> 10587.77s]  guy's is thumbtacked. The game does not look anything like it. Okay, let's just go.
[10597.34s -> 10602.33s]  Anarchy Rules. It's got to be lowered. The volume is way too low.
[10606.50s -> 10614.92s]  Insufficient space. Pay per view needs 93 blocks. Wait, what's on here?
[10615.72s -> 10627.02s]  Freudian weapon thanks to the 10 community subs. 10 more. You know this is the first
[10627.02s -> 10642.14s]  place we're going. You gotta, there's no way there's something on here. That's impossible.
[10653.26s -> 10668.73s]  Create. Body. Loading screens for every single one. Mail. Oh my god, that is, that's very,
[10668.73s -> 10698.79s]  very large. How skinny can they get? Let's go with muscle. Hairy, scarred, bruised,
[10698.79s -> 10718.52s]  cut, diseased. Okay, let's go with rib. How do I select the color? What's the, how do I make
[10718.52s -> 10735.94s]  them, how do I make them like green? Yeah, make Thanos. That's not a bad idea. It is
[10735.94s -> 10761.08s]  loading so heavily. What does Thanos have for eyes? Nope, that's, that's my eyes.
[10762.68s -> 10777.67s]  That's not bad. You can't control him. This is very early character creator, so
[10780.10s -> 10785.88s]  mouth. Got a kind of a large mouth. Whoa, there we go. Getting there. 22 looks kind of like it
[10785.88s -> 10823.02s]  could be. No, 22, 21, 22 is probably the closest. No, hold on. Grimace. There we go.
[10824.34s -> 10832.90s]  Mouth 12. Oh, why does mouth 11 have to not be, come on, go the other way. Vertical.
[10837.62s -> 10852.46s]  That's not bad either. But he doesn't have the lines going down.
[10852.94s -> 10871.93s]  Oh, no, Thanos doesn't have hair. None. No, but maybe goatee would look a little better.
[10872.81s -> 10880.87s]  No, this is the real way to do this, guys. I'm making the goatee purple.
[10881.43s -> 10921.32s]  Almost. Look at that. That's pretty close. All right. Mask. What do you have? No, no mask,
[10921.32s -> 10939.94s]  right? But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Accessories, head gear. Does he have anything
[10939.94s -> 10955.19s]  on his head? Or on his ears or anything? Or body? He doesn't have clothes, does he?
[10955.91s -> 10991.22s]  What does Thanos do? He has armor. It's like gold armor, right? That's pretty good. Add-ons.
[10991.22s -> 11002.42s]  Don't need any add-ons. Chest gear. Oh, wait a minute. There's armor. Bulletproof chest armor.
[11002.42s -> 11034.30s]  Gold. There we go. Shoulder pads look okay. The whole thing. Come on. That's annoying.
[11038.62s -> 11055.34s]  Take off the shirt. No, he's got nothing on his arm. Take the shirt off, the dude looks like.
[11055.34s -> 11071.45s]  He's just wearing like a children's section t-shirt. Okay, all right, all right, all right,
[11071.45s -> 11091.37s]  all right. Gloves. One glove. That's, come on. That's really cool. Nice one glove.
[11092.41s -> 11103.46s]  Accessories. Oh, wait, we can make it. I think we can make it. That's pretty close.
[11104.02s -> 11112.31s]  Hold on, because the, that will go. Yeah, that's as good as it's going to be.
[11112.95s -> 11137.69s]  We gotta make it gold. I'm not sure you even can. Give him a corsage. How is this yellow?
[11146.14s -> 11163.38s]  Okay. Well, there is kind of yellow. My mood bracelet. Well, all right. It was back here
[11164.44s -> 11180.12s]  somehow. This is ugly. It doesn't even matter. He's getting thrown in a dumpster
[11180.12s -> 11183.96s]  in about five minutes anyways. That's okay. That's all the infinity stones are activating
[11183.96s -> 11198.02s]  at the same time. He's got the mood infinity gauntlet. Where's the stupid glove? One glove.
[11198.02s -> 11220.73s]  There it is. Mood gauntlet. This thing sucks. Eww, you mood gauntlet, infinity gauntlet,
[11221.82s -> 11228.14s]  or is he just wearing like a gushers? He just squashed a bunch of gushers and taped
[11228.14s -> 11247.05s]  them together and put it on his arm. He's wearing like a candy bracelet. Okay, a little
[11247.05s -> 11267.96s]  darker. Somebody's saying the chest is wrong. Add-ons, right? So wait, it needs to be black?
[11268.60s -> 11288.44s]  Give him a vest. This is the shittiest Thanos. Come on. It was this 2001, guys. I can't make a
[11288.44s -> 11310.63s]  perfect Thanos. This is actually kind of the vest he wears. This one right here. That's it.
[11316.78s -> 11351.74s]  What color is the vest? Black. Black. Black. Black. Who cares? Use buckles? All right. Buckles.
[11351.74s -> 11379.82s]  Black. He doesn't have sleeves. Guys, it's not going to happen. I don't even know what he
[11379.82s -> 11385.32s]  looks like. Hold on. I haven't seen that movie. Let me just look it up. Oh, Thanos.
[11389.80s -> 11396.68s]  Okay, so this is pretty... He doesn't have sleeves. It doesn't matter. I already had it.
[11396.68s -> 11411.80s]  It was already done. The vest doesn't need to be on here. That's pretty close already.
[11412.44s -> 11447.16s]  All right, what do you have for pants? Good. Okay, boots. Looking good. They're not blue.
[11447.16s -> 11461.59s]  All right, that's it. Accessories. That's good. They're good. I get a bit of socks on them.
[11462.47s -> 11481.75s]  Oh, shit. I don't like those. There he is. Text. Rant. Okay, we're done. What is Thanos's
[11481.75s -> 11512.26s]  real name? Does he have a real name? Just one name. Okay, attributes. Let's do this correct.
[11516.74s -> 11529.30s]  So I would say for charisma, I've got one. Recovery. Speed. Toughness. Okay, he's tough.
[11529.30s -> 11535.14s]  He's strong. He's very fast. He's... Maybe his mat skills might not be great because he's not
[11535.14s -> 11558.58s]  used to being in a ring. That's pretty good. They need to be balanced. No, I don't even know
[11558.58s -> 11581.72s]  who any of these... DeVito. Is there anyone with a T? Thanos. Personality. Crowd is gonna heal.
[11583.67s -> 11591.51s]  Fighting style. Yeah. Theme song is important.
[11595.96s -> 11652.63s]  They all have the same song. Hectra. Entrance. Um, don't care. Okay, voice grunts.
[11669.82s -> 11678.06s]  That's pretty good. Booger.
[11701.27s -> 11706.23s]  I'm a damn handsome man. I'm a damn handsome man.
[11706.23s -> 11712.55s]  Oh, baby, these shorts are tight. Oh, baby, these shorts are tight.
[11712.55s -> 11720.39s]  Now this is booking worthy. Come on, admit it. You're jealous. So what if I'm a girl?
[11720.39s -> 11724.55s]  There will be no appeal. The shorter they are, the harder they fall.
[11724.55s -> 11728.39s]  I hate this. I believe in this match. You're the joke.
[11728.55s -> 11733.19s]  Why did we make Loki? I believe in this match. You're the joke.
[11733.19s -> 11737.43s]  You're about to give Magma the key with the dangerous alliance in my stable.
[11741.26s -> 11747.58s]  Fear me. I'm insane. No. I'm Martian boy. I'm not a wrestler. I'm office.
[11748.38s -> 11752.62s]  What? I'm Martian boy. I'm not a wrestler. I'm office. I'm office?
[11753.66s -> 11758.86s]  I'm not wasting my time with crap like you. I'm gonna show you where I'm the original
[11758.86s -> 11764.14s]  gangster. You might think you're good, but I'm super. This match ain't gonna make a
[11764.14s -> 11769.34s]  best of tape. After I take you out, I'm gonna take your old lady out and show her why they
[11769.34s -> 11776.70s]  call me R- Brother, I'm the American dream. Chicken. It's time for everybody's favorite
[11776.70s -> 11786.22s]  rest. Simon says I'm more intelligent. Simon says I'm more intelligent. Simon says you need
[11786.22s -> 11794.14s]  some discipline. I am the Sandman, the hardcore icon. Left ear. Oh, he was only in the left ear?
[11795.50s -> 11806.26s]  Hold on. Wait, I gotta put my left ear in. Simon says I'm more intelligent than you are.
[11807.78s -> 11812.82s]  Oh yeah, it was just one ear. You can't beat me. I'm from Calgary, Alberta,
[11812.82s -> 11818.66s]  Canada. I'm the original gang. I'm gonna leave the broadcast booth just to kick your ass.
[11819.62s -> 11827.86s]  Good night, Chesty. Wherever you are.
[11832.10s -> 11841.61s]  Who is this? What three-year-old was in the extreme championship wrestling? What?
[11847.99s -> 11849.43s]  Where was there a child?
[11850.23s -> 11855.13s]  I'm prodigy, son of the great one. Your head is so tiny.
[11856.73s -> 11862.98s]  You're just another speed bump in my push to the top. Tonight, when you scream,
[11862.98s -> 11869.54s]  it had better be in tune. Oh, man. I'm gonna take this fist and shove it down your throat.
[11870.26s -> 11874.74s]  I may look like an underdog, but don't let that fool you. I've got a tremendous bite.
[11875.62s -> 11880.10s]  Be forewarned. My capacity for violence has yet to be ascertained.
[11885.54s -> 11890.02s]  I may look like an underdog, but don't let that fool you. I've got a tremendous bite.
[11894.02s -> 11897.14s]  I'm gonna take this fist and shove it down your throat.
[11898.10s -> 11903.51s]  I may look like an underdog, but don't you. I'm gonna take this. I may look like an under-
[11903.51s -> 11906.95s]  That's fucking hilarious. You're just another speed bump in my-
[11906.95s -> 11907.45s]  You're good.
[11909.38s -> 11931.45s]  Okay. Save. Save. Okay. S-A. Whatever. Wrestling name. Thanos. Change.
[11933.53s -> 11947.30s]  Fan po- Oh, I don't care. Go back and do the hit sounds. This kid. Hold on.
[11948.79s -> 11960.66s]  Name. Attributes. Moves. Personality. Fighting style. Theme song. The kid. What is the kid's
[11960.66s -> 11991.53s]  theme song then? Blazed Orphe. What a kid. Voice grunts. The kid. The kid. The kid.
[11992.58s -> 12011.19s]  I just have the kid be the running partner. Well, we don't- I don't even know how to play
[12011.19s -> 12020.60s]  the game yet. We gotta get there first. Hold on. Frickin'. I can't get over that.
[12021.42s -> 12034.02s]  Create. Okay, that's it. Create a pay-per-view. Edit stadium. Hold on. Let me just see.
[12034.90s -> 12042.65s]  This is all dumb. It's the entrance sign. Scaffold. Ban? All right. Let's go. Let's go.
[12042.65s -> 12052.95s]  Let's go. This is an exhibition. One-on-one. Lumberjack. Battle Royale. Hate match. Team
[12052.95s -> 12065.27s]  rumble. Stable match. Well, let's just- let's do a eight-man tag. Can I change the rules?
[12065.27s -> 12087.18s]  Battle Royale? What the hell is that? No. There's no kid. There's no the kid.
[12089.21s -> 12101.46s]  Okay, so we're gonna do the trainer. So I'm just gonna be-
[12101.46s -> 12120.66s]  Okay, so order list. No, I can't do that. Back it up. I'm really confused about how this whole
[12120.66s -> 12144.84s]  thing is working here. How many can I have in here? Wait, why is this so many?
[12150.06s -> 12171.90s]  Match. I can't change that. I don't understand. I can't see. This is just a Battle Royale.
[12172.54s -> 12179.64s]  Win modifier is none. Belt channel is no. Simulation on- is it just a rumble?
[12181.26s -> 12198.18s]  Brick. TKO. Off. This is just a bootleg rumble. It is. I think I want to play,
[12198.18s -> 12217.26s]  though. Maybe not. Let's just go. See what happens. Thanos is- yes, he is. Thanos is
[12217.26s -> 12238.06s]  right here. Are there no entrances? You're just begging. You're just another speed bump
[12238.06s -> 12244.47s]  in my push to the top. I hate this already. I don't like it. I really don't.
[12268.66s -> 12274.34s]  I want to play. The commentator is still on.
[12274.34s -> 12297.50s]  I want to play. Where's the crowd? Why is there no audience sounds?
[12311.61s -> 12319.83s]  They keep doing low blows to me. That's supposed to be an audience member.
[12322.34s -> 12333.82s]  So I wonder what the entrance is like for the kid. There's no music either.
[12336.65s -> 12339.45s]  How do you lose? Do you think it's thrown over the top rope?
[12344.57s -> 12348.33s]  Because only four people are allowed in here at one time and there's 30 that are supposed
[12348.33s -> 12367.99s]  to be here. This is gonna take a very- this- I think we have to do something else.
[12368.87s -> 12378.68s]  I'm not sure it's gonna be a win or a loss.
[12381.26s -> 12410.92s]  Exhibition versus one-on-one, right? Or three-way dance between me, the trainer,
[12412.54s -> 12423.80s]  and- this is- no, that's victory. This guy. Match options. Death match. Barbed wire.
[12423.80s -> 12429.05s]  Dumpster match. That's what I'm talking about. Brimstone match. Dumpster match.
[12429.61s -> 12446.89s]  Win modifiers. Simulation. On. No, off. I want to play. Let's go. This is a dumpster match.
[12460.46s -> 12476.26s]  Where are the entrances? There's no entrance? This is not the entrance. No, it is not.
[12481.82s -> 12487.58s]  I'm gonna knock you out cold with the orange bond and then finish you off with the trainer
[12487.58s -> 12493.22s]  song. I've proved in the past that being a champion wasn't a fluke. Now you get to
[12493.22s -> 12498.94s]  experience my skills. Let's go.
[12513.82s -> 12516.94s]  How does dumpster match work? Do you have to get thrown in the dumpster?
[12531.62s -> 12536.68s]  That's block. Okay. Can you guys fight each other? This is supposed to be a fatal three-way
[12541.78s -> 12548.02s]  and down stays player one. Ascending the turnbuckles. The trainer climbing up. Can I go
[12548.02s -> 12556.82s]  outside? How do you leave? Okay, that's run. Let's go use the dumpster.
[12560.23s -> 12564.15s]  They're not just gonna keep doing this, are they?
[12565.51s -> 12570.70s]  Off the ropes. Against the ropes. Into the ropes. Oh, you figured it out. Good.
[12570.70s -> 12575.34s]  The bounce off the ropes. He's taking it to the outside. He takes a well-deserved
[12575.82s -> 12577.18s]  change. How do I change who I want to look at?
[12598.49s -> 12604.62s]  Low blows. Don't give me that. There's a, a nose.
[12618.36s -> 12627.58s]  How does this match work? They won't fight each other. They're just gonna fight me,
[12628.62s -> 12635.88s]  which is bullshit on its own, right? I'm gonna lose. I'm almost out of health.
[12637.30s -> 12638.98s]  You can't pin me. There's no pinning.
[12647.54s -> 12651.38s]  It's over. I lost. I got put in the dumpster.
[12668.89s -> 12671.05s]  Who's bleeding? Why is there blood all over the ground?
[12673.53s -> 12678.09s]  Can I get out? I think I'm just in here. I think I lose. That's it.
[12678.09s -> 12698.95s]  Why am I dead? We have to do Bravestone after this. I need to know what that's like.
[12710.76s -> 12713.08s]  The disc just had to load to pull that audio off.
[12717.00s -> 12720.92s]  Looks like the trainer is going to beat an actual wrestler.
[12722.94s -> 12738.33s]  This game has a 38 on Metacritic, even back then. All right, I don't know much more I can
[12738.33s -> 12752.98s]  take of this. It's a different weight category. That might be true. They only have five minutes
[12752.98s -> 12767.54s]  and 45 seconds to finish this. Most of the sounds in this game are just diarrhea cramp
[12767.54s -> 12785.13s]  noises. His back? There's nothing with his shoulder. He bladed on his shoulder. He's
[12785.13s -> 12809.24s]  bleeding. I think this is the end. Just throw him in the dumpster. That's all you have to do.
[12809.32s -> 12817.82s]  You don't have to do anything else. He's red. Speaking of red,
[12818.70s -> 12826.47s]  LaCrando just gave a hundred dollars. LaCrando, thank you so much for the hundred bucks.
[12827.67s -> 12831.02s]  Hey Jeremy, remember me? It's time for some free shit.
[12831.82s -> 12833.10s]  The bounce off the ropes?
[12839.64s -> 12843.96s]  Okay, that's over, but thank you LaCrando.
[12848.28s -> 12855.86s]  Those of you that don't know what he's talking about, there's an extreme amount of money that
[12855.86s -> 12863.46s]  was given two days ago. It was one of the most outrageous things I've ever had on stream
[12863.46s -> 12870.44s]  for monetarily. It was ridiculous. Thank you. I don't know what this means.
[12871.72s -> 12877.83s]  Do you know how to do the secret poo move? I don't want to do a poo move.
[12878.71s -> 12903.16s]  How about mother jack, four way dance, and I do brimstone. Let me just do one on one.
[12903.16s -> 12910.09s]  Hate match, death match, cage match, street fight, barbed wire, dumpster, table, brimstone,
[12910.17s -> 12922.41s]  rage in the cage, back lot, brawl. Street fight? Let's try street fight.
[12932.07s -> 12966.73s]  Isn't street fight just a match with weapons, is it? Oh shit, it might be. I'm not sure
[12967.29s -> 12971.53s]  what's very childlike about this. I would do this if I was in the ring.
[12976.41s -> 13005.61s]  Okay, I did trainer again, didn't I? Just gonna walk. Do it again, same thing, do it again.
[13011.14s -> 13023.05s]  All right. Wrestling is not real. You're just another speed. He said wrestling's not real.
[13023.85s -> 13030.98s]  So there's punch, kick, and then there's a grapple. Vertical suplex. That's grapple and
[13030.98s -> 13034.90s]  it's up. Yeah, okay. So that's how that works. Emmerlock, reverse that move.
[13036.82s -> 13044.42s]  Reverse it. How are these street rules? Arm wretch. Wrestlers around the world use that move.
[13047.06s -> 13058.70s]  Where are the weapons? Hip toss. Emmerlock. I seem to only know how to do the arm wretch.
[13065.24s -> 13069.16s]  There we go, you have to down, up in a direction, left in a direction. Okay, I get it.
[13078.22s -> 13087.48s]  Use the infinity gauntlet. Emmerlock. Give me a goddamn weapon. That's smart, take it to
[13087.48s -> 13109.94s]  the outside. Arm wretch. Look at the crowd. Do you reach underneath? How do you? I want to
[13109.94s -> 13120.36s]  pick up some. Take it all the way out? Can I reach in the crowd? Most of the games allow
[13120.36s -> 13132.28s]  you to reach in the crowd. Nope. Can't go back that way. Fantastic. Yeah. Emmerlock.
[13132.60s -> 13151.51s]  What the fuck can I even do? All right, we're gonna. Street fight.
[13153.75s -> 13156.31s]  I'm not seeing much street and I'm not seeing very much of a fight either.
[13167.10s -> 13173.45s]  Win location anywhere. Move list. Hip toss. Body slam. Spinning DDT.
[13189.77s -> 13194.47s]  This is really kind of boring actually. We're gonna do a brimstone match.
[13197.59s -> 13203.45s]  It needs to be like a bunch of fire or something. A four-way dance and a brimstone.
[13204.17s -> 13222.76s]  Doesn't matter. Brimstone, here we go. Let's go. Moigan and Floydgan had superior combat
[13222.76s -> 13237.38s]  mechanics. All right, it got interesting. Remember how excited I was for this? I know.
[13238.42s -> 13245.22s]  This is a bust, unfortunately. I'm gonna say a funny baby line and then we can move on.
[13247.78s -> 13261.21s]  Now go to my comic. Funny. Against the rope. Finally, somebody's not fighting me. How do I go?
[13262.57s -> 13268.95s]  Can you not go outside? Hip toss. I've even seen fans do that.
[13275.80s -> 13277.96s]  It's just fire out there. You can't go outside.
[13278.84s -> 13294.49s]  Yeah, now this is all fun. It could have been. Half-a-tentative.
[13295.77s -> 13300.81s]  But unless I see somebody burn here. Player one is down and he's hurt.
[13303.29s -> 13305.94s]  Do I only have two moves?
[13306.02s -> 13311.19s]  Do I only have two moves?
[13325.38s -> 13329.72s]  So what's the point of the PNG outside around the edge?
[13330.44s -> 13334.28s]  Body slam. Is there no point to that? A move like that will never make the highlight real.
[13334.28s -> 13341.37s]  He stays down. There's just a blinking bitmap image. Why am I doing this?
[13341.85s -> 13351.06s]  They're all against me.
[13358.07s -> 13359.99s]  Somebody fight somebody else, please.
[13365.11s -> 13367.67s]  What's with this guy and everyone being able to do every move?
[13373.43s -> 13379.74s]  Oh, you know, hip toss. My grandmother can do that. DDT, fans can do that move.
[13380.94s -> 13382.46s]  Come on. Reverse that.
[13387.48s -> 13388.04s]  Hip toss.
[13392.38s -> 13393.02s]  Into the rope.
[13395.02s -> 13400.14s]  It's not as easy as you think. I've left their aggro range like four times.
[13405.43s -> 13406.71s]  Get away from me, please.
[13414.46s -> 13418.76s]  He's wide open. This game makes me nauseous.
[13420.52s -> 13424.44s]  I didn't like that sound. That was a very, very bad sound.
[13426.76s -> 13428.44s]  Not much skill needed there.
[13430.12s -> 13433.48s]  Is there any move that this guy doesn't think is not impressive?
[13434.44s -> 13440.81s]  Against the ropes.
[13441.85s -> 13444.65s]  I just light me on fire and so I can be done with this.
[13450.09s -> 13453.26s]  Player one can't keep his hands up.
[13453.26s -> 13454.78s]  Who's gonna throw me over? Who's gonna burn me?
[13462.78s -> 13463.58s]  Why are you pinning?
[13465.40s -> 13466.12s]  I stuck away.
[13468.76s -> 13470.65s]  There is nobody there.
[13471.61s -> 13475.14s]  Oh, ref, that's like a 12 pound.
[13480.31s -> 13483.59s]  He's still pinning.
[13485.19s -> 13487.19s]  He doesn't get it. He still thinks I'm under there.
[13510.86s -> 13515.35s]  Somebody kill me.
[13516.07s -> 13517.61s]  Just kill me already.
[13518.41s -> 13523.19s]  Can I just drop a cinder block on this guy's head or something?
[13523.59s -> 13525.03s]  Seriously, the guy that's lying down.
[13526.07s -> 13528.92s]  Can a stage light fall and hit him in the skull?
[13560.46s -> 13561.50s]  Why don't you get in the ring?
[13561.50s -> 13569.02s]  Nobody can go outside. It's actually just not even.
[13569.02s -> 13569.82s]  It's there for show.
[13572.22s -> 13576.30s]  Brimstone match is just to keep you in the ring.
[13576.86s -> 13579.18s]  There's no cool effect. There's no fire.
[13579.74s -> 13580.54s]  It's just there.
[13595.96s -> 13598.44s]  I'm just waiting for somebody to throw me over the edge.
[13600.38s -> 13602.30s]  The trainer doesn't do anything.
[13602.30s -> 13604.22s]  All right, that's it. I'm out of here.
[13604.62s -> 13611.62s]  It actually was just like a PNG.
[13612.26s -> 13640.38s]  I just need... I'll just wait.
[13640.38s -> 13641.74s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait. Calm down, calm down.
[13641.74s -> 13643.58s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait. Trust me, trust me.
[13644.22s -> 13645.02s]  Hi, Mom.
[13645.02s -> 13646.06s]  See? Look.
[13646.06s -> 13655.19s]  Here comes a much needed beating.
[13658.66s -> 13659.86s]  Is this it? Is this all? It's back here.
[13659.86s -> 13664.86s]  Wow. Yes.
[13664.86s -> 13665.90s]  Arm wrench.
[13665.90s -> 13667.90s]  He really seized an opportunity there.
[13669.10s -> 13669.90s]  There's nothing else there.
[13669.90s -> 13675.85s]  God damn it. What a bust.
[13675.85s -> 13678.63s]  That's so disappointing. What a bust.
[13678.63s -> 13679.75s]  What an actual bust.
[13679.75s -> 13685.82s]  All right, we got...
[13685.82s -> 13698.47s]  We got Tony Hawk 2 coming up here.
[13699.62s -> 13702.26s]  Either Tony Hawk 2 or...
[13702.26s -> 13703.62s]  No, wait, this one.
[13703.62s -> 13705.70s]  This one's going to be fucking fantastic.
[13705.70s -> 13706.74s]  I can't wait to play this one.
[13711.58s -> 13712.62s]  Hear me out on this one.
[13714.89s -> 13716.25s]  We got Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2,
[13716.97s -> 13719.37s]  but I feel like I need to end on that one
[13719.37s -> 13721.93s]  because I'm going to play it for at least an hour or two.
[13721.93s -> 13722.43s]  Right?
[13723.13s -> 13729.82s]  When we... I don't know.
[13729.82s -> 13730.62s]  That's tricky.
[13732.34s -> 13733.14s]  We'll see.
[13733.14s -> 13735.06s]  We don't have to do all of them in one day.
[13735.78s -> 13738.14s]  These can happen over the course of a few days,
[13738.14s -> 13739.58s]  over the course of like a week or so.
[13741.46s -> 13742.50s]  In the meantime, just give me a second.
[13743.06s -> 13743.86s]  I want to grab water.
[13744.42s -> 13745.46s]  It's been about four hours
[13745.46s -> 13746.58s]  and I want to grab something to drink.
[13746.58s -> 13747.22s]  I'll be right back.
[13748.18s -> 13924.97s]  So coming up now is...
[13928.15s -> 13950.71s]  This is a game about evolution from the description.
[13951.27s -> 13953.98s]  Those of you that have ever played Warcraft 3,
[13954.78s -> 13958.14s]  there's a game mode, a custom game mode that used to exist.
[13960.97s -> 13962.65s]  It was called Evolution,
[13962.65s -> 13965.58s]  where you had to eat and grow
[13966.60s -> 13968.36s]  and eat other things and other players.
[13970.10s -> 13971.62s]  You could transform into other things.
[13974.63s -> 13975.27s]  No, not Spore.
[13975.27s -> 13975.83s]  Not Spore.
[13977.85s -> 13980.01s]  That's called Darwin's Island is what it was called.
[13982.04s -> 13987.00s]  And I begged, begged for an actual real
[13987.00s -> 13988.20s]  developed version of that game.
[13991.86s -> 13993.70s]  And we got it in 1998.
[13995.56s -> 13997.80s]  Five years before Darwin's Island.
[13997.80s -> 14001.78s]  Sorry about that loud noise.
[14011.13s -> 14013.69s]  The story is fiction and it resembles actual names
[14013.69s -> 14015.45s]  or historical facts as coincidental.
[14016.17s -> 14033.85s]  Anything else?
[14033.85s -> 14035.45s]  Is it voiceover or something?
[14037.02s -> 14037.66s]  Nothing.
[14037.66s -> 14039.82s]  It's Mars.
[14052.79s -> 14056.63s]  60, 70 million years ago, Mars turns into Venus.
[14065.59s -> 14066.95s]  Full motion video cut scene.
[14067.67s -> 14068.87s]  Are they gonna be real actors?
[14068.87s -> 14069.43s]  I hope so.
[14069.43s -> 14084.86s]  A nice gentle rain falling on the terrain.
[14084.86s -> 14093.40s]  I thought you start as like a little tadpole
[14094.04s -> 14096.26s]  and you can grow to be as big as that mountain.
[14096.82s -> 14103.21s]  How did they get video 70 million years ago?
[14103.93s -> 14104.81s]  I have no idea.
[14105.53s -> 14111.59s]  Probably some, some like Rick and Morty episode.
[14111.59s -> 14113.75s]  Seventh cross.
[14113.75s -> 14129.02s]  Is there a melee missile?
[14129.02s -> 14129.82s]  Random missile?
[14129.82s -> 14130.38s]  What does that mean?
[14131.18s -> 14134.71s]  They're relaxing, relaxing things to say.
[14135.35s -> 14137.30s]  By the way, I can't save.
[14137.30s -> 14138.34s]  What the hell is even on this?
[14139.30s -> 14149.56s]  Should I stop removing shit from the VMU?
[14150.12s -> 14158.04s]  You barely understand what the game is.
[14158.04s -> 14158.44s]  Don't worry.
[14159.16s -> 14161.54s]  It will be, all will be revealed for you.
[14164.90s -> 14165.94s]  Here are six boards.
[14165.94s -> 14168.42s]  Select a more appropriate color for each board
[14168.42s -> 14169.46s]  from balls above.
[14171.70s -> 14173.35s]  Is he saying rats?
[14173.35s -> 14174.23s]  He's saying rats.
[14175.75s -> 14188.87s]  This board signifies offense.
[14188.87s -> 14190.95s]  Press the A button when you have selected a color.
[14193.35s -> 14193.91s]  No, what?
[14194.95s -> 14204.34s]  Does the color have to do with anything for offense?
[14205.14s -> 14206.71s]  Blue offense.
[14207.75s -> 14216.47s]  Water, fire, water, lightning, poison, holy, decay.
[14217.11s -> 14218.23s]  I'm not sure which one I want.
[14220.02s -> 14227.99s]  I got poison.
[14228.63s -> 14234.07s]  Okay, what's this one signify?
[14234.07s -> 14237.03s]  This board signifies PSI power.
[14237.03s -> 14238.15s]  Pounds per square inch.
[14238.15s -> 14240.07s]  Press the A button when you have selected a color.
[14241.27s -> 14244.98s]  Okay, so we've got power washer.
[14247.50s -> 14248.06s]  Vice grip.
[14249.42s -> 14250.30s]  Hydraulic press.
[14251.26s -> 14255.14s]  What white is.
[14265.16s -> 14265.56s]  Yellow.
[14267.40s -> 14268.28s]  But PK.
[14268.28s -> 14269.80s]  PK fire, PK freeze.
[14270.76s -> 14274.14s]  Go yellow.
[14274.14s -> 14279.50s]  This board, defense.
[14279.50s -> 14280.22s]  So defense.
[14281.34s -> 14284.68s]  Holy defense.
[14285.32s -> 14286.36s]  Or light defense.
[14287.08s -> 14287.72s]  Decay defense.
[14287.72s -> 14288.92s]  I'm gonna go with water defense.
[14288.92s -> 14290.04s]  I feel like it's gonna be very important.
[14295.45s -> 14296.17s]  Intelligence.
[14299.48s -> 14303.00s]  Holy, decay, white, red.
[14303.00s -> 14305.00s]  I'm just gonna say white, I guess.
[14306.36s -> 14307.24s]  No, no, no, no.
[14310.14s -> 14311.18s]  We look a holy person?
[14314.15s -> 14314.87s]  Yeah, let's do it.
[14316.07s -> 14319.75s]  This board signifies healing.
[14319.75s -> 14320.79s]  Ah, that's not good.
[14320.79s -> 14321.59s]  I got rid of the white one.
[14322.71s -> 14323.83s]  That's probably like holy.
[14324.71s -> 14325.35s]  Or light.
[14328.30s -> 14330.33s]  Could be.
[14332.25s -> 14334.50s]  No, red.
[14336.26s -> 14337.80s]  Maybe this is something cool.
[14337.80s -> 14338.20s]  Okay, let's do it.
[14340.04s -> 14343.21s]  Finally, dexterity.
[14344.01s -> 14344.25s]  Red.
[14345.61s -> 14354.10s]  What do we get?
[14355.90s -> 14357.34s]  All colors have been selected.
[14357.34s -> 14359.42s]  Okay to send color image to DNA.
[14360.54s -> 14362.06s]  Yeah, 3D print something here.
[14362.06s -> 14363.02s]  Come on, let's see it.
[14364.38s -> 14382.41s]  It's a dragon.
[14383.21s -> 14387.00s]  Light is supposed to be born.
[14387.00s -> 14387.96s]  Please give it a name.
[14389.72s -> 14400.82s]  Cheeto?
[14400.82s -> 14400.98s]  No.
[14401.54s -> 14418.79s]  I'm gonna make it Thanos.
[14418.79s -> 14419.35s]  Why?
[14419.35s -> 14419.91s]  Thanos?
[14421.03s -> 14422.41s]  We just did that.
[14424.78s -> 14427.34s]  I just made Thanos in the ECW game.
[14427.34s -> 14430.06s]  You want me to make Thanos the single cell organism?
[14441.78s -> 14442.98s]  No, no, not Xanos.
[14445.22s -> 14460.81s]  It was in my head.
[14460.81s -> 14462.09s]  You guys were all just talking about it
[14462.09s -> 14463.37s]  and I just did A-N-O.
[14466.79s -> 14469.22s]  All right, here we go.
[14474.39s -> 14475.27s]  I don't understand.
[14476.07s -> 14491.56s]  What am I supposed to do?
[14495.43s -> 14497.03s]  Oh shit, hold on, there's another one.
[14497.03s -> 14498.07s]  There's another animal over there.
[14498.71s -> 14500.31s]  Okay, there's a bunch of animals.
[14500.31s -> 14500.95s]  Eat the kelp?
[14506.01s -> 14506.73s]  Evolution?
[14523.54s -> 14524.26s]  I died.
[14524.26s -> 14530.30s]  All right, how do I eat?
[14530.30s -> 14532.14s]  Option, let's look at the controls here.
[14532.14s -> 14532.62s]  I can't.
[14536.20s -> 14538.04s]  Just have to survive, but how do you live?
[14538.68s -> 14539.48s]  Where do you eat?
[14539.48s -> 14540.68s]  How do you grow?
[14540.68s -> 14543.83s]  Is it a smaller animal or something?
[14543.83s -> 14545.43s]  I can't leave, I don't have legs.
[14545.43s -> 14546.39s]  I can't breathe air.
[14548.10s -> 14549.14s]  There's that crab again.
[14549.94s -> 14557.11s]  I have to assume it's eat the...
[14557.11s -> 14557.91s]  What's that?
[14557.91s -> 14558.23s]  Kelp?
[14559.05s -> 14559.93s]  Got it.
[14559.93s -> 14563.77s]  All right, I leveled up, I'm a slug.
[14568.70s -> 14585.54s]  Can I avoid the crab?
[14586.18s -> 14590.57s]  Come on, I got to at least get somewhere here.
[14590.57s -> 14591.05s]  What's this?
[14593.24s -> 14594.28s]  Slug again.
[14594.28s -> 14595.16s]  I can't leave yet.
[14595.80s -> 14597.90s]  I just ate some dirt.
[14598.70s -> 14601.99s]  Once you start hearing the Slenderman shit,
[14601.99s -> 14602.79s]  that's when you have to leave.
[14603.51s -> 14604.71s]  Where's the crab?
[14605.27s -> 14611.06s]  I don't see the crab over here.
[14613.64s -> 14614.12s]  Kelp?
[14614.12s -> 14614.52s]  Right here?
[14615.24s -> 14615.88s]  All right, what else?
[14615.88s -> 14616.36s]  What do we know?
[14617.08s -> 14621.27s]  Ooh, okay, I got somewhat of a body growing here.
[14621.91s -> 14628.20s]  I don't want to eat that anymore?
[14628.76s -> 14633.24s]  Okay, I don't like eating those now.
[14633.24s -> 14635.88s]  Do I have to change the food?
[14637.45s -> 14640.18s]  All right, I'm going to save it.
[14642.92s -> 14645.00s]  No, no, no, no, where's the crab?
[14645.00s -> 14645.64s]  Where's the crab?
[14647.70s -> 14648.42s]  Right there.
[14648.42s -> 14649.38s]  Oh, fuck.
[14649.38s -> 14652.98s]  How do I get out?
[14660.38s -> 14662.62s]  Oh my god, he's right behind me.
[14662.62s -> 14663.82s]  How do I eat more food?
[14664.38s -> 14669.14s]  Let's look at the status window.
[14670.73s -> 14672.01s]  Enterable terrain.
[14672.01s -> 14673.29s]  HP five out of five.
[14674.58s -> 14676.18s]  No part data.
[14676.18s -> 14679.86s]  I can't go down here.
[14679.86s -> 14680.42s]  Wait, here we go.
[14681.30s -> 14681.62s]  Got it.
[14682.26s -> 14688.18s]  Can I leave?
[14690.36s -> 14691.00s]  Okay, hold on.
[14691.00s -> 14692.52s]  Mutation EX power.
[14693.32s -> 14694.04s]  I have a heal.
[14694.76s -> 14700.76s]  How do I turn that off?
[14701.32s -> 14705.29s]  I gotta save again.
[14705.29s -> 14705.93s]  Where's the crab?
[14708.06s -> 14708.62s]  Oh, shit.
[14709.42s -> 14714.33s]  No, it doesn't want me to leave.
[14715.13s -> 14726.60s]  Why don't we use some kind of leaf monster?
[14726.60s -> 14727.48s]  I don't know what the hell it is.
[14732.42s -> 14733.78s]  I'm picking up random stuff and eating it.
[14734.50s -> 14741.90s]  Where's the crab?
[14741.90s -> 14742.30s]  Right there.
[14743.66s -> 14745.19s]  Press buttons.
[14746.87s -> 14750.39s]  The buttons I'm doing are B, heals.
[14751.51s -> 14753.21s]  That's my magical spell that I have.
[14753.21s -> 14754.17s]  I need to find something to eat.
[14767.54s -> 14768.18s]  Mutation.
[14771.38s -> 14774.18s]  Level one head, level one arm.
[14776.28s -> 14779.00s]  Defense, intelligence, heal, dexterity.
[14781.99s -> 14782.71s]  Eat crab.
[14785.19s -> 14786.71s]  I don't think I can eat the crab.
[14786.71s -> 14793.59s]  I can barely move down here.
[14800.12s -> 14800.84s]  Oh, cave.
[14801.48s -> 14802.78s]  I can't go that way.
[14803.34s -> 14808.42s]  I can't go down there.
[14808.42s -> 14808.98s]  What the fuck?
[14814.54s -> 14815.74s]  What am I supposed to eat?
[14816.54s -> 14818.30s]  I just killed something.
[14820.66s -> 14822.50s]  Okay, I just killed and ate something.
[14823.14s -> 14823.86s]  What was that?
[14825.16s -> 14826.84s]  I don't even know what animal that was.
[14827.56s -> 14834.74s]  How much more food do I need?
[14840.90s -> 14843.42s]  Can I fight the crab?
[14846.07s -> 14847.43s]  I'm so afraid to fight the crab.
[14847.43s -> 14849.11s]  I don't have any more VMU data left.
[14849.91s -> 14850.63s]  All right, here we go.
[14850.63s -> 14851.19s]  Fight crab.
[14851.99s -> 14858.54s]  I got it.
[14858.54s -> 14859.18s]  Okay.
[14859.18s -> 14859.50s]  Did it?
[14860.06s -> 14864.98s]  Am I evolving?
[14872.73s -> 14873.29s]  Did I evolve?
[14874.01s -> 14878.28s]  Am I bigger?
[14879.16s -> 14881.64s]  Evolution.
[14899.21s -> 14900.17s]  What the fuck am I doing?
[14942.81s -> 14945.13s]  Okay, so I need red.
[14947.08s -> 14947.72s]  Red head.
[14948.52s -> 14953.72s]  Is everybody getting this?
[14953.72s -> 14973.53s]  The manual?
[14974.25s -> 14981.56s]  Well, let me just save it.
[14981.56s -> 14982.68s]  I don't think I have enough room.
[14984.86s -> 14986.86s]  Can't save insufficient memory card.
[14987.58s -> 14989.80s]  There's a bunch of dog shit on here.
[14996.10s -> 14997.46s]  I think I have to kill the crab.
[14998.50s -> 15013.98s]  This is the most intricate part of the game
[15013.98s -> 15015.58s]  and certainly the most frustrating
[15015.58s -> 15017.10s]  that you need a manual.
[15018.14s -> 15024.34s]  All right, well,
[15024.34s -> 15027.50s]  somebody give me some Minecraft skin coordinates
[15028.14s -> 15028.94s]  and I'll make one.
[15035.06s -> 15036.02s]  I can't even attack it.
[15047.13s -> 15047.77s]  Coordinates.
[15048.81s -> 15050.01s]  Mine is 57.
[15050.81s -> 15052.44s]  Here's the FAQ.
[15052.44s -> 15053.24s]  Hold on.
[15053.24s -> 15060.23s]  Hold on a second, everybody.
[15060.79s -> 15062.07s]  Let me just see what they got here.
[15062.71s -> 15068.07s]  I'm just going to do the first one I see.
[15072.66s -> 15073.38s]  Getting started.
[15076.44s -> 15077.08s]  Stage one.
[15077.08s -> 15078.60s]  Surviving in the pond.
[15079.40s -> 15084.06s]  Okay.
[15084.70s -> 15093.86s]  Small strands of seaweed.
[15093.86s -> 15095.46s]  It smells green microorganisms.
[15096.02s -> 15097.90s]  Okay, first a slug.
[15098.87s -> 15099.67s]  Then bigger than that.
[15100.47s -> 15101.35s]  Third time you'll grow
[15101.35s -> 15103.51s]  probably your first working set of limbs.
[15104.47s -> 15105.75s]  This is the origin creature.
[15116.34s -> 15117.54s]  From here the real fun begins.
[15117.54s -> 15119.06s]  Your creature now has a functional head.
[15122.58s -> 15124.66s]  Go to the main menu and select mutations
[15125.82s -> 15127.58s]  to view your origin and its glory.
[15133.00s -> 15134.28s]  Find things that are moving
[15134.28s -> 15135.40s]  but look harmless.
[15135.40s -> 15138.84s]  Small and brown are your watch words here.
[15138.84s -> 15141.56s]  Some look sort of like pitcher plants
[15141.56s -> 15142.68s]  or sea cucumbers.
[15142.68s -> 15145.00s]  Some like crawling forearm slugs.
[15145.24s -> 15150.04s]  You earn EVPs for everything you slay.
[15151.08s -> 15152.60s]  For a small fry like you, you're hunting now.
[15152.60s -> 15153.56s]  You'll get one apiece.
[15153.56s -> 15154.52s]  Crabs are worth two.
[15154.52s -> 15157.00s]  If you are killed, you keep your EVPs
[15157.00s -> 15158.36s]  and return to the starting monolith.
[15158.36s -> 15160.04s]  So don't fear the crabs too much.
[15161.80s -> 15163.00s]  And then select evolution.
[15165.13s -> 15167.88s]  You only need two EVPs
[15167.88s -> 15168.84s]  at the beginning of the game
[15168.84s -> 15169.64s]  to build a new part.
[15169.64s -> 15171.00s]  So you can either make a beeline
[15171.00s -> 15173.24s]  for the monolith after two kills
[15174.04s -> 15175.16s]  or build up some points.
[15175.96s -> 15176.68s]  All right, here we go.
[15176.68s -> 15177.72s]  So that's the problem.
[15178.52s -> 15179.32s]  That's the problem.
[15179.32s -> 15180.44s]  We need one more point.
[15181.48s -> 15184.49s]  We need two EVPs.
[15184.49s -> 15185.45s]  We have one EVP.
[15186.33s -> 15188.62s]  So look for the little things in the ground
[15189.62s -> 15190.58s]  like this guy right here.
[15196.44s -> 15197.24s]  Kill him.
[15197.24s -> 15218.54s]  What about that?
[15218.54s -> 15219.34s]  That wasn't a crab.
[15219.34s -> 15220.70s]  That was a little guy.
[15221.42s -> 15226.36s]  I had a little slug here.
[15231.11s -> 15232.15s]  Oh, right there, right there.
[15233.35s -> 15235.51s]  All right, I'm getting the hang of it.
[15235.51s -> 15236.71s]  I'm starting to figure out what's going on here.
[15237.59s -> 15241.86s]  Come on, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.
[15241.86s -> 15242.42s]  Got it, okay.
[15242.42s -> 15243.14s]  That's two, right?
[15243.86s -> 15251.30s]  Pick that up.
[15251.30s -> 15255.06s]  Got one more over here.
[15255.70s -> 15263.59s]  All right, before the crab gets here.
[15263.59s -> 15265.27s]  All right, let's build level up.
[15267.16s -> 15278.33s]  Shit, I keep them though.
[15282.44s -> 15283.00s]  I'm stuck.
[15283.00s -> 15284.36s]  It is an invisible wall.
[15284.36s -> 15285.80s]  I can't go by the invisible wall.
[15290.94s -> 15292.14s]  So I should have enough to do this.
[15292.14s -> 15295.13s]  I should have three.
[15298.20s -> 15298.92s]  Three, all right.
[15301.66s -> 15302.54s]  Okay, here we go.
[15303.50s -> 15311.77s]  A button mash.
[15313.06s -> 15313.62s]  Evolution.
[15314.42s -> 15316.36s]  You're presented with a 10 by 10 grid
[15316.36s -> 15318.36s]  to draw in in six colors to choose from.
[15318.36s -> 15319.24s]  Not surprisingly,
[15320.20s -> 15322.68s]  these are the same colors you chose before.
[15323.88s -> 15327.37s]  You task it to draw whatever design seems appropriate.
[15327.37s -> 15328.33s]  Then click send.
[15329.69s -> 15334.34s]  So it doesn't matter.
[15334.34s -> 15359.34s]  I got arm level two from Shito.
[15360.78s -> 15364.73s]  I got it.
[15364.73s -> 15367.53s]  I leveled up my arm.
[15368.57s -> 15385.88s]  All right, so I'm going to do more damage.
[15385.88s -> 15386.92s]  Can I kill the crab now?
[15400.25s -> 15401.93s]  You have to equip the new arms.
[15409.24s -> 15410.92s]  All right, mutation.
[15413.00s -> 15416.58s]  Arm, level two, low fish.
[15421.21s -> 15421.85s]  Ooh, okay.
[15423.69s -> 15424.01s]  Head.
[15426.86s -> 15427.18s]  Nice.
[15427.18s -> 15429.18s]  All right, so now I actually have usable...
[15430.22s -> 15431.02s]  These things are probably...
[15431.02s -> 15431.98s]  Okay, time to kill the crab.
[15432.70s -> 15438.76s]  Oh, maybe not.
[15439.88s -> 15440.76s]  One more, right?
[15440.76s -> 15441.72s]  Right here.
[15441.72s -> 15445.16s]  Find the invisible wall there.
[15453.45s -> 15453.95s]  Die.
[15456.38s -> 15457.34s]  What the fuck?
[15462.97s -> 15464.41s]  I am surviving one hit,
[15464.41s -> 15474.46s]  but how many hits does it take to put at least 2,000 hours?
[15476.42s -> 15478.66s]  Don't give me that bullshit anymore.
[15478.66s -> 15480.81s]  All right, this should be two.
[15480.81s -> 15482.33s]  I should give this another opportunity, right?
[15482.89s -> 15484.87s]  Killed a slug.
[15485.51s -> 15488.54s]  How many EV points do I have?
[15489.98s -> 15491.74s]  EVO, EVE, what is it?
[15492.46s -> 15494.98s]  I should have two, right?
[15495.62s -> 15499.24s]  Let's go evolve again.
[15499.88s -> 15509.64s]  I want to get a head this time.
[15512.62s -> 15515.45s]  Well, I got two now.
[15515.45s -> 15516.57s]  We're going to clear it.
[15518.25s -> 15519.05s]  What else can I draw?
[15520.09s -> 15532.84s]  How about a pizza slice?
[15533.56s -> 15534.55s]  Bad idea.
[15588.49s -> 15589.13s]  Fuck!
[15589.13s -> 15595.42s]  I don't want this one here.
[15595.98s -> 15607.13s]  That's fine.
[15607.29s -> 15652.47s]  Oh, my fucking God.
[15652.47s -> 15654.63s]  It lags when you press the button sometimes.
[15655.51s -> 15661.27s]  How do I fix that?
[15661.27s -> 15662.15s]  Can I clear it?
[15662.87s -> 15667.67s]  How do I clear?
[15677.45s -> 15679.21s]  All right, it's fucking deep dish, all right?
[15706.49s -> 15707.45s]  Is it the same thing?
[15717.77s -> 15718.49s]  Low fish.
[15718.49s -> 15719.21s]  It's the same thing.
[15719.85s -> 15726.03s]  Shit.
[15727.13s -> 15733.66s]  Turned out to be a waste.
[15734.38s -> 15735.26s]  Sorry, we can get it back.
[15746.54s -> 15747.42s]  Stupid crab.
[15753.53s -> 15754.97s]  No, we can't be done with this one yet.
[15755.53s -> 15757.29s]  Not until I get out off the moat.
[15763.72s -> 15764.52s]  I got two again.
[15764.52s -> 15765.48s]  I'm going to draw a face.
[15767.62s -> 15770.02s]  Games for the Dreamcast are rare and expensive.
[15771.75s -> 15772.47s]  They sure are.
[15773.19s -> 15787.98s]  Two out of two, right?
[15791.10s -> 15791.58s]  There it is.
[15791.58s -> 15792.54s]  All right, no pizzas.
[15793.34s -> 15794.66s]  I'm going to draw.
[15795.38s -> 15797.02s]  Let's go with like...
[15798.10s -> 15799.54s]  What was my attack one?
[15800.42s -> 15800.92s]  Blue?
[15801.62s -> 15802.81s]  Was blue attack?
[15802.81s -> 15803.85s]  Blue is offense, right?
[15850.31s -> 15850.95s]  No, I did.
[15851.99s -> 15852.87s]  I did, guys.
[15852.87s -> 15853.37s]  Sorry.
[15854.79s -> 15858.50s]  No, you didn't.
[15858.50s -> 15859.00s]  I did.
[15862.02s -> 15863.22s]  No, I did, actually.
[15863.86s -> 15890.54s]  Don't I have three different arms, though?
[15891.26s -> 15913.30s]  I wonder if I can get the fuck out of here.
[15913.30s -> 15914.26s]  Arms on feet.
[15915.46s -> 15916.81s]  Can you do that?
[15918.33s -> 15918.83s]  No.
[15919.21s -> 15929.26s]  All right, there's one.
[15930.62s -> 15933.42s]  One more.
[15933.42s -> 15934.54s]  Again.
[15935.08s -> 15938.14s]  I have to kill that crab before I put another game in here.
[15938.86s -> 15951.18s]  That's two.
[15952.28s -> 15954.84s]  Back to the evolution table.
[15955.88s -> 15959.63s]  Wait, hold on.
[15960.33s -> 15965.46s]  There's another one right here.
[15965.46s -> 15966.34s]  I'm going to get them.
[15966.34s -> 15966.98s]  Just get them.
[15966.98s -> 15967.48s]  Farm them.
[15978.02s -> 15978.74s]  Two, four.
[15984.58s -> 15985.22s]  Grind it out.
[15985.22s -> 15985.86s]  But I want to be careful.
[15985.86s -> 15986.82s]  I don't want to run into a crab.
[15987.86s -> 15989.53s]  I'll get six.
[15991.98s -> 15996.30s]  One more should do it.
[15997.18s -> 15998.68s]  Bubbles.
[15999.70s -> 16004.73s]  Slug.
[16011.08s -> 16011.72s]  One more slug.
[16011.72s -> 16012.22s]  Come on.
[16012.84s -> 16013.64s]  It's falling somewhere.
[16023.18s -> 16032.62s]  Well, let's just go.
[16032.62s -> 16034.54s]  Yeah, there are no crabs around, that's true.
[16036.44s -> 16036.94s]  Okay.
[16038.44s -> 16039.16s]  Let's do white.
[16040.04s -> 16044.44s]  Let's make a piece of real abstract art.
[16044.44s -> 16059.16s]  Put it in the arm section.
[16063.16s -> 16064.52s]  Let us draw.
[16064.52s -> 16065.64s]  What do you mean, the arm section?
[16067.03s -> 16068.71s]  But I think that's the last three things I made.
[16069.67s -> 16105.56s]  Let you guys do it with click maps.
[16105.56s -> 16107.88s]  You want to click each individual cube.
[16108.68s -> 16114.15s]  That's like a fucking snooze fest.
[16115.91s -> 16116.71s]  Not like this isn't.
[16117.35s -> 16131.42s]  Let's see what we get.
[16131.42s -> 16154.02s]  Is there a...
[16154.66s -> 16155.96s]  Can I...
[16155.96s -> 16159.22s]  Don't use the same colors?
[16159.22s -> 16159.94s]  This is...
[16159.94s -> 16160.44s]  What?
[16163.18s -> 16167.66s]  This is yellow black, yellow black red, blue black, white...
[16167.66s -> 16169.34s]  I've never used either one of these two colors.
[16170.63s -> 16171.99s]  Don't put it in the arm section.
[16171.99s -> 16172.95s]  What if there...
[16172.95s -> 16174.23s]  Where's the other section?
[16176.55s -> 16177.35s]  Wait, hold on.
[16177.35s -> 16178.07s]  Hold on a second.
[16178.07s -> 16178.71s]  Wait.
[16178.71s -> 16186.94s]  I have to select that arm.
[16186.94s -> 16188.22s]  I can't move it from here.
[16192.79s -> 16194.23s]  I can't select anything.
[16194.23s -> 16200.66s]  You can't click on the head, but I can't click on anything.
[16201.46s -> 16202.65s]  There's no...
[16202.65s -> 16205.45s]  I can't move the cursor over to head, body, and legs.
[16209.40s -> 16210.36s]  So I have...
[16210.36s -> 16211.96s]  But wasn't I doing yellow before?
[16212.92s -> 16215.82s]  Yeah, but look.
[16215.82s -> 16216.06s]  All right.
[16216.06s -> 16217.18s]  Look, look, look, look, look.
[16217.18s -> 16217.58s]  Look at...
[16217.58s -> 16218.54s]  Look at body down there.
[16218.54s -> 16219.04s]  Yellow.
[16221.35s -> 16223.35s]  There's only red and yellow here.
[16223.35s -> 16224.71s]  Why didn't I get a head or a body?
[16241.72s -> 16243.32s]  Don't draw in the bottom left.
[16243.96s -> 16250.38s]  Let's try it.
[16251.02s -> 16258.86s]  Let's go white.
[16258.86s -> 16263.75s]  Let's go here.
[16264.55s -> 16281.80s]  Okay.
[16282.76s -> 16294.89s]  What?
[16294.89s -> 16297.05s]  Do you understand how this doesn't make any sense?
[16297.05s -> 16297.29s]  Look.
[16297.29s -> 16297.69s]  Listen.
[16297.69s -> 16298.25s]  Listen to me.
[16298.25s -> 16298.81s]  Listen to me.
[16299.37s -> 16300.73s]  This is a full cube.
[16303.10s -> 16304.78s]  This is not just bottom left.
[16304.78s -> 16306.06s]  This is bottom right.
[16306.06s -> 16307.34s]  This is all of them equally.
[16309.43s -> 16310.47s]  This one I can understand.
[16311.11s -> 16311.83s]  But what the fuck?
[16312.55s -> 16313.03s]  This one?
[16313.67s -> 16316.18s]  This one is the...
[16316.18s -> 16317.86s]  Every single square is filled up.
[16324.46s -> 16332.95s]  Arm has priority.
[16332.95s -> 16335.11s]  It's just going to default to arm if it's full.
[16348.81s -> 16349.13s]  Okay.
[16349.13s -> 16350.09s]  Let's put the head on.
[16360.07s -> 16360.39s]  Head.
[16361.45s -> 16362.33s]  Desert bone.
[16367.58s -> 16368.78s]  I look pretty fucking ugly.
[16369.34s -> 16374.33s]  So now I got...
[16374.97s -> 16376.02s]  I got some.
[16376.74s -> 16377.70s]  I got an opportunity here.
[16378.42s -> 16380.33s]  All right.
[16380.33s -> 16381.61s]  Let's go kick that crab's ass.
[16382.33s -> 16387.54s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[16388.74s -> 16391.86s]  Should I?
[16391.86s -> 16397.35s]  I just got baited.
[16397.35s -> 16399.35s]  I was aiming over the other side.
[16399.35s -> 16400.79s]  I can move in one crab now?
[16401.75s -> 16403.07s]  Nothing.
[16411.77s -> 16412.17s]  Got it.
[16412.17s -> 16413.61s]  I just killed my first new animal.
[16414.17s -> 16429.34s]  Looks like nothing.
[16430.62s -> 16438.60s]  Got two more.
[16439.56s -> 16440.28s]  I need a body.
[16441.00s -> 16449.99s]  Fight crab?
[16449.99s -> 16450.39s]  Not yet.
[16451.59s -> 16452.78s]  All right.
[16452.78s -> 16455.18s]  So body is top right.
[16455.18s -> 16457.42s]  And should I do yellow for body?
[16459.08s -> 16461.48s]  That's kind of the idea or does it matter?
[16461.48s -> 16462.28s]  I don't think it does.
[16471.14s -> 16471.38s]  Legs.
[16471.38s -> 16472.26s]  Do legs instead.
[16473.06s -> 16474.78s]  Bottom right.
[16475.50s -> 16491.00s]  One big beefy leg.
[16491.64s -> 16500.30s]  Green legs?
[16500.30s -> 16501.58s]  It's not gonna be arm two.
[16502.70s -> 16506.36s]  Green, white, green.
[16508.12s -> 16511.30s]  Too bad you can't be as creative.
[16511.30s -> 16512.58s]  But yeah, that's why I was drawing them.
[16513.14s -> 16513.54s]  Come on.
[16514.34s -> 16518.02s]  I guess you just have to make a random pattern.
[16518.02s -> 16520.55s]  What do you say?
[16521.35s -> 16530.70s]  Is chat wrong?
[16546.54s -> 16547.18s]  Level three.
[16554.66s -> 16556.18s]  It's random and I'm unlucky?
[16564.10s -> 16568.89s]  I hate this daft punked guy that just keeps talking.
[16569.77s -> 16576.17s]  Well, at least, yeah, it's level three.
[16577.54s -> 16578.66s]  There's a crab right behind me.
[16578.66s -> 16579.06s]  I gotta move.
[16587.78s -> 16589.86s]  You have to draw a leg to get a leg.
[16590.58s -> 16591.85s]  That's not how it works.
[16593.86s -> 16594.34s]  All right.
[16594.34s -> 16595.06s]  Leg.
[16595.06s -> 16595.54s]  Not arm.
[16595.54s -> 16595.78s]  Arm.
[16596.92s -> 16597.72s]  Low fish.
[16597.72s -> 16598.28s]  High fish.
[16600.15s -> 16602.07s]  His attack goes to 23.
[16608.06s -> 16610.92s]  Ooh, kind of like butterfly wings.
[16611.56s -> 16612.44s]  Do I fight crab?
[16613.82s -> 16614.22s]  All right.
[16614.22s -> 16614.94s]  Crab, let's go.
[16616.70s -> 16617.02s]  Not yet.
[16617.02s -> 16617.82s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[16617.82s -> 16618.38s]  I'm not ready.
[16619.10s -> 16621.35s]  I gotta get out of the water.
[16621.35s -> 16622.07s]  I need legs.
[16622.71s -> 16639.02s]  Come on here.
[16639.02s -> 16643.18s]  You gotta fight them on your turf.
[16643.90s -> 16644.38s]  It's true.
[16645.02s -> 16646.06s]  I gotta get legs.
[16646.38s -> 16648.70s]  Bring him up to the land and I'm gonna step on his head.
[16649.74s -> 16653.05s]  What do I got to say?
[16653.69s -> 16657.29s]  Oh, they both took two crabs.
[16657.29s -> 16657.61s]  All right.
[16658.57s -> 16670.98s]  Come on.
[16670.98s -> 16673.43s]  Come on, hurry.
[16673.43s -> 16674.15s]  Go, go, go.
[16674.15s -> 16674.95s]  All right, I need legs.
[16677.02s -> 16678.30s]  So is this just horse shit?
[16679.10s -> 16680.38s]  Should I be listening to you guys?
[16680.38s -> 16681.26s]  I don't think I should be.
[16684.42s -> 16685.62s]  I'm gonna go with blue.
[16687.85s -> 16688.89s]  Do one dot.
[16691.93s -> 16692.65s]  Leg section.
[16693.29s -> 16695.08s]  Draw a car.
[16698.49s -> 16701.43s]  Fuck it.
[16701.43s -> 16701.83s]  Blue?
[16702.47s -> 16712.47s]  No, I'm making two legs.
[16713.43s -> 16725.58s]  Give me legs, Jack.
[16725.58s -> 16726.74s]  You were very wrong.
[16739.99s -> 16750.98s]  You draw legs in the leg square.
[16750.98s -> 16752.10s]  That's what I just did.
[16752.98s -> 16754.02s]  I just did that.
[16754.82s -> 16761.26s]  I can't fight two crabs.
[16761.98s -> 16766.31s]  Come here, slugs.
[16766.31s -> 16767.11s]  I need two more.
[16768.15s -> 16768.71s]  Come on.
[16768.71s -> 16770.07s]  I can't go that way.
[16770.07s -> 16770.95s]  Come on.
[16770.95s -> 16771.27s]  Why?
[16772.47s -> 16773.91s]  Get out.
[16773.91s -> 16774.23s]  No.
[16793.27s -> 16793.75s]  Thank God.
[16794.90s -> 16795.38s]  No.
[16795.38s -> 16796.26s]  Why can't I put this on?
[16796.82s -> 16802.82s]  Why can't I put the head on?
[16805.74s -> 16810.97s]  Try all sorts of designs.
[16810.97s -> 16812.25s]  You might be surprised at what you find.
[16812.25s -> 16814.01s]  Geometric shapes, mirror images, symmetrical designs,
[16814.01s -> 16815.29s]  like little random U shapes here and there,
[16815.29s -> 16816.09s]  little random dots.
[16819.38s -> 16819.94s]  Head.
[16819.94s -> 16828.50s]  That's because I'm back to being scrub level.
[16828.50s -> 16854.60s]  The crab over there?
[16854.60s -> 16863.46s]  No, not next.
[16863.46s -> 16863.94s]  Not yet.
[16864.58s -> 16866.70s]  If I get out of the water and the game sucks,
[16866.70s -> 16868.22s]  then we can go from there.
[16868.94s -> 16870.62s]  But this is an interesting concept.
[16871.26s -> 16871.82s]  Where is it?
[16872.62s -> 16885.14s]  I just need to get out of the pond.
[16886.02s -> 16888.15s]  Once I get out of Goldshire, I'll be fine.
[16888.95s -> 16891.93s]  I need two crabs.
[16891.93s -> 16892.41s]  Come on.
[16892.41s -> 16893.21s]  Why are they so fast?
[16894.17s -> 16901.42s]  Are there any other squids?
[16904.22s -> 16905.50s]  I can't tell if that thing is...
[16906.06s -> 16907.90s]  I mean, how am I supposed to fight these?
[16909.30s -> 16910.42s]  I have a constant crab.
[16911.38s -> 16920.71s]  There's a bug chasing me too.
[16923.18s -> 16923.90s]  The bug hit me.
[16924.78s -> 16925.82s]  It didn't really hurt that much.
[16932.33s -> 16939.18s]  Please give me legs.
[16940.14s -> 16941.10s]  Get the crab away.
[16949.54s -> 16949.86s]  Legs.
[16949.86s -> 16951.46s]  All right, we're going to draw something cool.
[16951.46s -> 16952.42s]  Ready? Watch this one.
[16952.42s -> 16956.84s]  Little shapes.
[16956.84s -> 16957.88s]  We're going all in.
[16958.76s -> 17022.12s]  The designs are only worth arm level two.
[17022.76s -> 17024.04s]  There's a bug fighting me.
[17024.04s -> 17024.60s]  Where...
[17024.60s -> 17025.08s]  Look at him.
[17025.64s -> 17026.04s]  Hit him.
[17027.00s -> 17027.88s]  I know you can do it.
[17029.67s -> 17031.03s]  And now here comes the crab.
[17032.84s -> 17033.48s]  Get out.
[17033.48s -> 17033.88s]  Quick.
[17033.88s -> 17034.44s]  Get out.
[17034.44s -> 17035.00s]  Get away.
[17035.00s -> 17035.40s]  Get out.
[17035.40s -> 17036.12s]  Get away from me.
[17036.84s -> 17045.70s]  I just want something else besides arm two.
[17046.42s -> 17048.15s]  I'm going to do like...
[17048.15s -> 17048.55s]  I don't know.
[17049.19s -> 17051.72s]  I'm going to do an elaborate tetris thing.
[17052.44s -> 17065.48s]  I can't put this on.
[17066.28s -> 17067.51s]  Powers.
[17067.51s -> 17068.87s]  I have wind.
[17069.51s -> 17070.73s]  How did I get wind?
[17080.74s -> 17084.50s]  Come on, kill it.
[17093.56s -> 17094.52s]  Is it still alive?
[17112.52s -> 17113.08s]  I need...
[17113.08s -> 17114.60s]  I need my arm level three.
[17121.22s -> 17122.74s]  Why did I de-evolve my arms?
[17122.74s -> 17123.14s]  I didn't.
[17123.86s -> 17126.98s]  When you die, you have to come back and do it again, essentially.
[17127.86s -> 17132.30s]  He's dead.
[17134.02s -> 17136.58s]  If a design creates something that's almost useful,
[17136.58s -> 17139.14s]  say a leg that's too powerful for you to use,
[17139.14s -> 17140.66s]  or one that's underpowered for you,
[17140.66s -> 17144.34s]  try modifying it just a little and resending it.
[17145.14s -> 17145.70s]  And some...
[17145.70s -> 17146.50s]  Add some dots.
[17147.30s -> 17162.84s]  I still can't put it on.
[17162.84s -> 17163.32s]  Come on.
[17165.40s -> 17167.34s]  Here comes the crab.
[17168.14s -> 17172.01s]  There really is no point to the crab being in the tutorial.
[17173.29s -> 17177.08s]  And there's no point to those rocks.
[17177.08s -> 17179.00s]  And the rocks that just...
[17179.00s -> 17180.12s]  You can't go through them.
[17180.12s -> 17180.52s]  You can't...
[17182.98s -> 17183.70s]  Oh, man.
[17184.50s -> 17191.32s]  I very clearly could go through those rocks.
[17191.96s -> 17207.18s]  Do I have any evolution points here?
[17211.77s -> 17215.91s]  Do a U shape around the grid.
[17216.87s -> 17220.42s]  So, like, you're talking about, like, this.
[17221.46s -> 17226.60s]  Would you classify that as a U?
[17227.40s -> 17228.28s]  Around?
[17228.28s -> 17228.84s]  Is that a U?
[17229.72s -> 17236.68s]  No, U.
[17237.70s -> 17238.98s]  Your mileage will vary.
[17241.22s -> 17241.94s]  No, no, no.
[17241.94s -> 17243.14s]  Small U shapes.
[17243.94s -> 17250.07s]  So we're talking about, like, these.
[17250.71s -> 17270.01s]  Just don't put one in arms.
[17270.01s -> 17270.51s]  Okay.
[17273.98s -> 17310.90s]  Send it back?
[17311.54s -> 17313.53s]  Hold on.
[17313.53s -> 17313.85s]  I need to...
[17314.49s -> 17322.98s]  I can't even put these on.
[17329.02s -> 17329.52s]  No!
[17329.90s -> 17330.86s]  The crab!
[17330.86s -> 17331.82s]  Why do you exist?
[17332.38s -> 17335.10s]  Do I get the colors?
[17335.10s -> 17335.42s]  All right.
[17335.42s -> 17335.82s]  I did...
[17335.82s -> 17337.26s]  I did white and black before.
[17337.26s -> 17338.30s]  It was still the same thing.
[17339.02s -> 17341.66s]  I can't pick him up.
[17342.30s -> 17349.98s]  I had to because crab.
[17349.98s -> 17350.30s]  All right.
[17350.30s -> 17351.50s]  I'm trying this one more time.
[17351.50s -> 17353.02s]  Before I just rage.
[17353.02s -> 17353.74s]  Quitting something else.
[17354.86s -> 17368.26s]  What color have I not used?
[17368.26s -> 17368.50s]  Red?
[17369.54s -> 17371.21s]  I did.
[17371.21s -> 17371.53s]  Okay.
[17371.53s -> 17372.17s]  Blue U's.
[17373.61s -> 17373.93s]  That.
[17373.93s -> 17374.57s]  Whatever that is.
[17376.20s -> 17377.24s]  Blue legs.
[17378.20s -> 17380.66s]  Blue and white in the corner.
[17380.66s -> 17381.38s]  Black and white.
[17382.95s -> 17383.83s]  Green and white.
[17384.47s -> 17385.43s]  Blue, black.
[17386.47s -> 17386.71s]  Red.
[17386.71s -> 17387.43s]  We're going red.
[17388.31s -> 17394.63s]  Red.
[17396.97s -> 17398.25s]  Let's see.
[17398.97s -> 17438.73s]  Do you have to...
[17440.17s -> 17441.61s]  I don't even know what to ask.
[17441.61s -> 17442.41s]  Is it the color?
[17443.37s -> 17445.61s]  So if it's blue in the top...
[17446.73s -> 17450.57s]  Blueprint?
[17450.57s -> 17451.93s]  Somebody got a blueprint.
[17451.93s -> 17452.49s]  Is that for real?
[17453.13s -> 17456.39s]  It's time to stop.
[17456.39s -> 17457.03s]  No, it's not.
[17457.03s -> 17457.35s]  Not yet.
[17460.09s -> 17460.49s]  Not yet.
[17461.13s -> 17461.69s]  It's not...
[17461.69s -> 17462.17s]  Maybe soon.
[17465.37s -> 17466.01s]  No, this is the...
[17466.01s -> 17466.17s]  I can't.
[17466.17s -> 17466.97s]  I'm backing myself in the corner.
[17466.97s -> 17467.37s]  I gotta back up.
[17467.37s -> 17467.85s]  I gotta get out of here.
[17467.85s -> 17468.49s]  Gotta go, go, go, go.
[17468.49s -> 17468.97s]  No, no, no, no.
[17468.97s -> 17470.17s]  No, there's two crabs.
[17470.97s -> 17473.70s]  Are there three crabs?
[17474.34s -> 17486.04s]  Really liking the zero slugs that they've got here.
[17486.04s -> 17486.68s]  This is great.
[17503.05s -> 17503.69s]  Head.
[17503.69s -> 17505.72s]  Still can't put that on.
[17506.44s -> 17512.49s]  This streamer's gonna leave an angry yahoo...
[17512.49s -> 17513.05s]  I just...
[17513.05s -> 17513.69s]  I just...
[17515.53s -> 17519.46s]  Just wanna get out of the pond.
[17519.46s -> 17521.88s]  That's all I know.
[17521.88s -> 17522.84s]  Just gonna get out of the pond.
[17523.64s -> 17525.96s]  And then we can play anything else.
[17525.96s -> 17528.04s]  I have to get out of the pond first, though.
[17528.04s -> 17528.76s]  That's very important.
[17529.56s -> 17539.70s]  It's loud.
[17539.70s -> 17540.34s]  Let me turn it down.
[17541.54s -> 17544.60s]  Should be better.
[17547.22s -> 17548.74s]  Do I have enough to evolve?
[17553.11s -> 17553.51s]  Another...
[17553.51s -> 17555.51s]  I need five to evolve?
[17555.51s -> 17555.75s]  Why?
[17556.39s -> 17557.91s]  It was two for so long.
[17557.91s -> 17558.15s]  What?
[17562.92s -> 17565.00s]  Thank you, Frodeon, for the 10 community subs.
[17565.80s -> 17574.87s]  Thank you so much, Frodeon.
[17574.87s -> 17577.35s]  Make a big white Z pattern.
[17580.55s -> 17581.27s]  God.
[17581.27s -> 17587.99s]  Can I just redeem arms?
[17587.99s -> 17588.95s]  I would love to.
[17594.98s -> 17595.86s]  Oh my.
[17595.86s -> 17596.50s]  Please.
[17596.50s -> 17597.54s]  Just get away from me.
[17602.39s -> 17603.27s]  Wind first.
[17603.27s -> 17604.31s]  How do I even use it?
[17608.98s -> 17609.30s]  I can't...
[17609.30s -> 17609.70s]  I don't even know how...
[17609.70s -> 17610.74s]  I can't even use the weapon.
[17611.38s -> 17615.05s]  I'm gonna get stuck.
[17624.26s -> 17625.86s]  Yeah, I didn't die from one hit from a crab.
[17670.92s -> 17671.64s]  No...
[17671.64s -> 17674.36s]  I need fi...
[17674.36s -> 17678.12s]  It's because I made too many fucking arms and I can't do anything with these.
[17678.12s -> 17681.06s]  I need five.
[17681.06s -> 17682.58s]  I might as well just redo it.
[17683.46s -> 17684.18s]  New character.
[17684.98s -> 17690.66s]  No, get away from me.
[17706.60s -> 17708.04s]  Red and green only.
[17714.23s -> 17716.23s]  I need to make a new character...
[17716.23s -> 17717.83s]  No, nobody wants to watch me do that.
[17718.55s -> 17723.38s]  I wish I could go down here.
[17736.66s -> 17737.06s]  Exit.
[17737.46s -> 17756.95s]  No, get me out of the game.
[17756.95s -> 17763.22s]  Oh, this game has so much potential.
[17763.22s -> 17768.74s]  But no, we're so out of reach because I made too many arms.
[17769.30s -> 17780.98s]  Just do it again.
[17781.86s -> 17782.58s]  Out of reach.
[17783.67s -> 17786.38s]  Yeah, that's funny.
[17786.38s -> 17789.34s]  I can't...
[17789.34s -> 17790.86s]  I know I can't edit.
[17790.86s -> 17793.02s]  There's nothing to edit and I can't do anything about it.
[17793.66s -> 17794.98s]  Going ahead.
[17795.96s -> 17796.44s]  Like this.
[17797.16s -> 17798.34s]  No.
[17798.34s -> 17804.65s]  It's gonna take a very long time to get where I am now.
[17805.45s -> 17806.73s]  But look at the spawns.
[17806.73s -> 17808.89s]  I need like five slugs to spawn.
[17808.89s -> 17809.53s]  Here's one.
[17816.74s -> 17818.42s]  Is somebody actually linking a...
[17818.42s -> 17823.70s]  Like an Imgur to a full-on leg blueprint?
[17823.70s -> 17824.18s]  You know what I'm saying?
[17824.18s -> 17825.70s]  Is there a leg blueprint in chat here?
[17833.86s -> 17834.50s]  No cheating?
[17834.50s -> 17835.94s]  No, I don't care about cheating at this point.
[17836.58s -> 17838.92s]  The game's cheating.
[17839.56s -> 17841.75s]  I gotta even it out.
[17842.31s -> 17849.88s]  Okay, how many more?
[17849.88s -> 17850.36s]  Two more?
[17859.19s -> 17859.67s]  Finally.
[17859.67s -> 17860.95s]  You finally started the spawns.
[17864.38s -> 17865.42s]  No, I can't move.
[17865.42s -> 17866.14s]  I'm stuck here.
[17872.26s -> 17874.98s]  When I looked at the game,
[17874.98s -> 17878.10s]  I looked up stuff about the box art
[17878.10s -> 17879.30s]  and I saw the description.
[17880.02s -> 17882.02s]  I thought this was going to be the best one.
[17882.02s -> 17884.42s]  I thought this was going to be my favorite Dreamcast game.
[17885.30s -> 17890.10s]  It was very, very...
[17890.10s -> 17890.98s]  I'm certain of it almost.
[17891.54s -> 17902.17s]  I need one or two more slugs and I can do this.
[17902.17s -> 17907.02s]  I'm trying this one last final time with the Imgur link.
[17915.00s -> 17915.32s]  Okay.
[17916.12s -> 17916.60s]  All right.
[17916.60s -> 17917.40s]  All right.
[17917.40s -> 17918.12s]  I can do that.
[17919.16s -> 17919.96s]  I can do that one.
[17920.60s -> 17934.82s]  All right.
[17934.82s -> 17935.30s]  Let's do it.
[17951.62s -> 17952.34s]  I need nothing...
[17952.34s -> 17953.38s]  Ah!
[17953.38s -> 17960.36s]  I can't like modify these.
[17961.82s -> 17962.70s]  Can't like change them.
[17963.66s -> 17977.11s]  I really don't even mind getting killed by...
[17977.11s -> 17978.15s]  I thought that was a slug.
[17978.63s -> 17979.67s]  It's a praying mantis.
[17980.47s -> 17986.30s]  Getting killed by the crab resets the slug spawns.
[17986.30s -> 17987.74s]  So I'm actually all right with dying.
[17988.38s -> 18002.71s]  Oh, somebody just kill me.
[18002.71s -> 18003.35s]  Just kill me.
[18004.15s -> 18010.25s]  Do it again.
[18010.81s -> 18020.22s]  Am I hitting anything?
[18020.22s -> 18024.65s]  I got it!
[18046.84s -> 18047.16s]  Whatever.
[18047.16s -> 18048.04s]  I got slug spawn.
[18048.76s -> 18050.55s]  All right.
[18050.55s -> 18051.51s]  I'm going to try this thing.
[18052.31s -> 18054.94s]  Somebody put a legit blueprint in the chat
[18054.94s -> 18055.66s]  and I'm going to use it.
[18056.30s -> 18059.30s]  Let's go evolve.
[18059.94s -> 18067.38s]  You could just kite the crab around and shoot it.
[18069.59s -> 18070.31s]  I mean, I...
[18070.31s -> 18070.79s]  He moves.
[18071.75s -> 18072.71s]  Well, not when you get stuck.
[18074.15s -> 18074.87s]  I could try.
[18076.84s -> 18077.24s]  No.
[18077.24s -> 18080.12s]  No, this is not the crab sitting right next to you.
[18081.40s -> 18083.32s]  Somehow didn't die.
[18084.20s -> 18087.98s]  I don't think I'm going to be able to do it.
[18093.67s -> 18094.71s]  Just give it to me.
[18094.71s -> 18095.35s]  They're going to kill me.
[18095.35s -> 18095.91s]  Just give it to me.
[18096.55s -> 18104.01s]  Because he can still move.
[18104.01s -> 18105.45s]  Because I can't move right now.
[18105.45s -> 18105.95s]  See?
[18106.57s -> 18107.21s]  If he has a good...
[18108.57s -> 18109.13s]  Oh, here we go.
[18109.13s -> 18110.09s]  Okay, kill the crab.
[18110.09s -> 18111.69s]  I'm going to get a crab killed right now.
[18112.57s -> 18115.27s]  He's stuck.
[18116.34s -> 18116.98s]  Holy shit.
[18117.62s -> 18119.80s]  I mean, what is a crab worth?
[18120.52s -> 18132.09s]  Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[18137.86s -> 18139.70s]  Y'all thought we were going away from this game?
[18141.62s -> 18153.22s]  Nope.
[18153.22s -> 18153.78s]  Okay.
[18153.78s -> 18154.74s]  Blueprint.
[18154.74s -> 18160.78s]  I don't care about colors.
[18160.78s -> 18162.30s]  I'm following this blueprint exactly.
[18192.10s -> 18193.78s]  It's minion art?
[18193.78s -> 18196.63s]  Wrong blueprint.
[18196.63s -> 18197.03s]  What do you mean?
[18205.27s -> 18206.07s]  Minion art.
[18209.67s -> 18210.31s]  Okay.
[18210.31s -> 18211.11s]  God damn it.
[18211.75s -> 18213.03s]  I'm so antsy right now.
[18213.67s -> 18215.19s]  I just want something that's not an arm.
[18215.19s -> 18215.91s]  Okay, here we go.
[18216.71s -> 18217.75s]  This is the...
[18217.75s -> 18219.03s]  Somebody has to link this.
[18219.03s -> 18219.51s]  Here we go.
[18219.51s -> 18219.83s]  Ready?
[18252.47s -> 18253.83s]  Leg is like pink.
[18254.55s -> 18255.91s]  Pink is red.
[18256.95s -> 18258.07s]  Red and white.
[18258.07s -> 18259.43s]  Red and white makes pink.
[18259.99s -> 18263.48s]  Red and white makes pink.
[18263.48s -> 18265.24s]  Red and white makes pink.
[18295.85s -> 18317.08s]  I can edit these.
[18317.08s -> 18322.39s]  But am I allowed to resend them with no...
[18322.39s -> 18325.11s]  I need EVP to resend them.
[18325.11s -> 18334.84s]  Sooner or later you're going to get whacked.
[18334.84s -> 18335.72s]  Probably quite often.
[18335.72s -> 18337.80s]  When you do, you wake up next to the initial monolith
[18337.80s -> 18339.08s]  back in the origin stage.
[18339.08s -> 18340.36s]  Once you stop screaming...
[18340.36s -> 18340.86s]  What?
[18343.69s -> 18344.81s]  Just do the American flag?
[18347.29s -> 18348.89s]  Joel says make American flag.
[18349.69s -> 18356.14s]  What have I done even so far?
[18356.78s -> 18360.54s]  I've done the automaton.
[18361.26s -> 18362.14s]  A slice of pizza.
[18363.10s -> 18364.54s]  A happy smiley face.
[18366.30s -> 18368.22s]  Guy jumping at you.
[18370.02s -> 18371.38s]  Chat was wrong.
[18372.10s -> 18373.14s]  Chat was wrong too.
[18374.02s -> 18375.82s]  Chat was wrong three.
[18378.71s -> 18379.99s]  Random to try to get anything.
[18381.93s -> 18382.89s]  Chat was wrong four.
[18386.31s -> 18387.67s]  Guy playing golf.
[18387.67s -> 18388.17s]  Golfing.
[18388.79s -> 18391.30s]  Chat was wrong five.
[18391.94s -> 18393.32s]  And chat was wrong six.
[18393.88s -> 18402.92s]  So I'm not clicking any part of your Imgur links.
[18406.79s -> 18410.66s]  One red cube in the lower right
[18410.66s -> 18411.78s]  is what you're telling me I need to do.
[18420.66s -> 18421.14s]  Okay.
[18421.14s -> 18421.46s]  Okay.
[18421.46s -> 18421.78s]  All right.
[18421.78s -> 18422.74s]  That's it.
[18422.74s -> 18423.06s]  Relax.
[18423.06s -> 18423.78s]  Everybody relax.
[18424.50s -> 18429.06s]  I can't even put on the desert eagle
[18429.06s -> 18430.18s]  where the fucking thing is called.
[18435.13s -> 18436.65s]  Small u around grid.
[18437.37s -> 18438.92s]  I need some more slugs.
[18439.64s -> 18440.76s]  I can't stop playing this.
[18441.48s -> 18444.22s]  We've been looking at the same image.
[18444.94s -> 18458.92s]  Four more.
[18459.72s -> 18473.78s]  Put on the head and the arms.
[18473.78s -> 18474.10s]  I can't.
[18474.10s -> 18474.90s]  I'm not strong enough.
[18475.62s -> 18477.51s]  My character sucks.
[18477.51s -> 18478.39s]  I can't put him on now.
[18479.27s -> 18479.67s]  Watch.
[18479.67s -> 18479.99s]  Ready?
[18481.99s -> 18482.23s]  See?
[18482.79s -> 18484.79s]  I can't even wear these.
[18485.43s -> 18487.59s]  Because my my prot is too low.
[18499.13s -> 18499.53s]  Fire.
[18501.61s -> 18502.81s]  Where did I get fire from?
[18502.81s -> 18503.69s]  Why do I have fire?
[18505.83s -> 18506.15s]  Okay.
[18507.34s -> 18508.22s]  Fire crab.
[18508.22s -> 18508.62s]  You got it.
[18513.27s -> 18515.51s]  Can you go like any faster?
[18515.51s -> 18516.01s]  Okay.
[18517.67s -> 18518.55s]  Back this way.
[18526.89s -> 18527.53s]  Back it up.
[18527.53s -> 18528.57s]  Back up, back up, back up, back up.
[18531.22s -> 18531.94s]  Got him.
[18531.94s -> 18533.56s]  Get his body too.
[18534.20s -> 18535.67s]  This is food for a month.
[18543.74s -> 18545.82s]  Play floygan brothers to calm down.
[18553.82s -> 18557.56s]  Is that enough?
[18559.50s -> 18561.18s]  Don't tell me that I can't
[18561.18s -> 18562.46s]  go down here to pick up the body.
[18563.34s -> 18564.38s]  Oh my god.
[18564.38s -> 18581.30s]  Am I gonna play resident evil 2?
[18581.30s -> 18581.78s]  Yes, I am.
[18583.43s -> 18584.47s]  Just not today.
[18585.27s -> 18587.90s]  I'll need to start that tomorrow.
[18588.46s -> 18593.30s]  Or, uh, I don't know.
[18593.30s -> 18594.28s]  We'll see.
[18594.28s -> 18595.08s]  I am going to play it though.
[18596.17s -> 18596.41s]  Okay.
[18596.41s -> 18598.25s]  I got enough to do one.
[18598.25s -> 18601.38s]  So let's do the American flag.
[18601.94s -> 18604.98s]  Okay.
[18604.98s -> 18606.58s]  Without looking, I'm going to do the American flag.
[18672.74s -> 18676.82s]  And that's not that's not that's not the American flag.
[18683.34s -> 18684.46s]  Hey, arm two.
[18699.75s -> 18700.55s]  All right.
[18700.55s -> 18702.39s]  I think I have to give up on this game.
[18704.14s -> 18705.02s]  I think so.
[18705.02s -> 18707.18s]  I mean, this game is stupid.
[18708.14s -> 18713.58s]  But look what I was supposed to do.
[18713.58s -> 18714.86s]  I keep getting arm two.
[18717.56s -> 18719.72s]  Black top left red bottom right.
[18720.52s -> 18723.46s]  I've tried this last this the last time I'm going to do this.
[18724.02s -> 18728.98s]  There's probably so much video game here.
[18728.98s -> 18731.64s]  They head behind arm two.
[18732.28s -> 18738.02s]  Can you imagine how much is in this game that you cannot access?
[18738.58s -> 18745.78s]  Let's try it.
[18746.42s -> 18766.98s]  Black top left red bottom right.
[18768.02s -> 18774.14s]  Wait, wait, except both.
[18774.14s -> 18776.06s]  You guys are saying all like three different things.
[18777.29s -> 18780.50s]  Black top left dot bottom right red dot.
[18783.02s -> 18784.06s]  This is this is going to work.
[18784.06s -> 18785.10s]  You're telling me.
[18785.10s -> 18785.58s]  Yes.
[18785.58s -> 18785.98s]  Do it.
[18792.90s -> 18793.86s]  Body ten.
[18796.25s -> 18796.49s]  What?
[18798.79s -> 18800.07s]  Why is it body ten?
[18800.71s -> 18801.88s]  That was a cheat code.
[18801.88s -> 18802.92s]  Somebody that's a cheat code.
[18810.41s -> 18811.45s]  Stab scorpion.
[18811.45s -> 18812.41s]  I can't even use this.
[18813.05s -> 18814.14s]  Not even close.
[18814.78s -> 18824.06s]  I need to level up like 48 times.
[18836.34s -> 18838.18s]  So I have to eat 48 bodies.
[18838.98s -> 18840.58s]  Are you trying to keep me here?
[18840.58s -> 18841.62s]  You're trying to lock me here?
[18842.42s -> 18853.45s]  No, don't go away from me.
[18867.59s -> 18868.87s]  Play this for the rest of the night.
[18869.83s -> 18871.35s]  I feel like everyone's going to run away.
[18880.22s -> 18883.34s]  Realistically, how often can you watch the guy on the stream
[18883.34s -> 18889.64s]  in front of your computer using his goldfish hands to punch slugs
[18890.44s -> 18892.28s]  before you're like, yeah, you know what?
[18892.28s -> 18895.37s]  I guess there's something else I could probably do right now.
[18895.37s -> 18896.57s]  And I can't go down here.
[18899.69s -> 18900.33s]  Do blobs.
[18901.93s -> 18903.53s]  There's only one or two blobs per.
[18917.56s -> 18923.06s]  If I walk on out of here, then the real stream begins.
[18923.70s -> 18924.70s]  You understand?
[18926.09s -> 18929.93s]  I stand up on my own two feet and I'm walking over that mountain.
[18930.49s -> 18944.95s]  It's a real stream coming up here.
[18945.59s -> 18946.07s]  Here we go.
[18948.34s -> 18957.75s]  I'm going to do what I would consider to be a real blacktop left and nothing else.
[18963.80s -> 18967.72s]  But it's going to be another cheat with its level 10 hands or something.
[18976.14s -> 18977.42s]  Don't waste the proteins.
[18977.98s -> 18986.26s]  Who cares if it's cheat?
[18986.26s -> 18986.90s]  Okay, here we go.
[18987.62s -> 18992.54s]  Somebody says green square right in the middle.
[18992.54s -> 18993.34s]  Is that what you want?
[18993.34s -> 18994.30s]  Is that what we're talking about?
[19001.06s -> 19008.90s]  No, just one black dot in the top left.
[19010.58s -> 19011.78s]  One guy said it, whatever.
[19013.61s -> 19014.89s]  I can't use this.
[19016.01s -> 19017.53s]  I can't use this.
[19017.53s -> 19018.89s]  What am I supposed to do with that?
[19019.61s -> 19022.97s]  What do you want me to do with that?
[19025.02s -> 19026.86s]  No, I'm doing Minecraft Steve next.
[19027.72s -> 19030.76s]  And it's going to get me something amazing.
[19031.40s -> 19050.54s]  What even is it?
[19050.54s -> 19050.78s]  Arm.
[19053.98s -> 19054.46s]  Demon.
[19055.10s -> 19057.40s]  Demon arm.
[19058.36s -> 19059.86s]  This is end game content.
[19060.58s -> 19065.19s]  I can't do anything with that.
[19065.83s -> 19067.75s]  All right, Minecraft Steve.
[19072.18s -> 19072.90s]  Minecraft Steve.
[19072.90s -> 19075.61s]  Okay, he's got the hair on top, right?
[19076.33s -> 19082.17s]  It goes down like this.
[19086.60s -> 19108.79s]  And then blue eyes, right?
[19108.79s -> 19109.75s]  He also has a goatee.
[19120.71s -> 19126.70s]  Can I do, I guess this?
[19127.66s -> 19141.51s]  It's not Cheeto.
[19141.51s -> 19149.35s]  Minecraft Steve?
[19149.35s -> 19152.36s]  No, he's got like a nose too, doesn't he?
[19153.08s -> 19156.26s]  Color so that it doesn't nose.
[19156.26s -> 19169.80s]  It's an emoji.
[19175.35s -> 19176.07s]  SpongeBob.
[19176.71s -> 19178.15s]  That's my, hold on.
[19178.15s -> 19179.91s]  I said I was going to do Minecraft Steve.
[19179.91s -> 19180.63s]  So I'm going to do it.
[19183.66s -> 19187.69s]  My God, no, no.
[19192.97s -> 19194.89s]  Fuck, fuck, fuck.
[19209.27s -> 19210.95s]  Okay, try it again.
[19211.75s -> 19226.84s]  What was the other thing I was going to do?
[19233.54s -> 19238.73s]  One yellow line down the bottom.
[19238.73s -> 19241.13s]  I don't even have enough fucking protein powder.
[19241.77s -> 19253.18s]  Do I have enough to even just make a T pose?
[19255.18s -> 19256.86s]  I can't believe that didn't do anything.
[19257.66s -> 19262.73s]  Okay, okay.
[19262.73s -> 19264.09s]  I can put on my level three hands.
[19265.86s -> 19267.46s]  And crabs aren't going to kill me anymore.
[19268.10s -> 19269.98s]  I can put on my desert bonehead.
[19271.67s -> 19272.95s]  So that looks good.
[19272.95s -> 19273.45s]  Okay.
[19274.57s -> 19276.41s]  I'm kind of decked out right now.
[19280.34s -> 19281.06s]  What, 14?
[19284.62s -> 19285.66s]  Demon arms I can't do.
[19286.30s -> 19287.32s]  All right, let's go.
[19288.04s -> 19299.35s]  Who's even, I can't even see who's down here.
[19299.35s -> 19300.15s]  Okay, another slug.
[19300.87s -> 19308.39s]  That's enough.
[19309.27s -> 19317.80s]  There's the crab.
[19318.68s -> 19320.20s]  Oh, he's getting in close.
[19321.00s -> 19325.02s]  Do it again, again, again, again, again.
[19325.02s -> 19331.66s]  Okay, let's try it again.
[19336.38s -> 19338.06s]  I think you're supposed to lose, guys.
[19338.06s -> 19339.34s]  You're supposed to get your ass kicked.
[19340.31s -> 19342.63s]  Get tons of protein powder points.
[19349.88s -> 19351.88s]  I'm at a point where I can reliably kill all these.
[19353.11s -> 19353.99s]  In one or two hits.
[19358.25s -> 19358.73s]  Observe.
[19361.08s -> 19362.76s]  Okay, you want me to make it just a big Z?
[19363.56s -> 19378.02s]  What's this, what's this one?
[19382.33s -> 19383.21s]  So you want a Z.
[19387.82s -> 19388.62s]  A giant Z.
[19389.42s -> 19404.62s]  I gotta make sure this is correct.
[19416.20s -> 19418.20s]  No, fucking stupid, the yellow thing.
[19418.20s -> 19418.70s]  Hold on.
[19432.90s -> 19435.70s]  Okay, there's your Z, I make a Z.
[19436.78s -> 19442.02s]  And it's done.
[19442.02s -> 19443.06s]  Somebody got it.
[19443.06s -> 19449.85s]  We got legs.
[19449.85s -> 19453.78s]  It's done.
[19453.78s -> 19455.62s]  I'm so excited to put these on.
[19455.62s -> 19457.78s]  Legs, new legs, high fish.
[19457.78s -> 19458.26s]  Put them on.
[19458.82s -> 19466.46s]  I'm still in the pond.
[19466.46s -> 19467.18s]  We can't leave.
[19467.82s -> 19473.05s]  They're not legs.
[19473.05s -> 19473.85s]  Yeah.
[19473.85s -> 19479.32s]  Can I go on this block?
[19488.26s -> 19489.06s]  I was holding it in.
[19491.53s -> 19492.09s]  Into the cave.
[19507.13s -> 19508.89s]  What the fuck was that thing?
[19508.89s -> 19509.69s]  I think that's a boss.
[19510.25s -> 19521.74s]  I'm not going in there.
[19521.74s -> 19524.14s]  We just got access to the deep pond.
[19528.86s -> 19530.78s]  All right, don't screw this up.
[19530.78s -> 19531.66s]  I just need some more.
[19532.38s -> 19533.82s]  And then I can get a good body.
[19535.02s -> 19540.78s]  And then I can throw my entire career down the toilet
[19540.78s -> 19542.30s]  by playing this game every day.
[19546.74s -> 19547.94s]  And nothing else ever.
[19552.31s -> 19553.43s]  Save game, I can't.
[19554.23s -> 19558.66s]  I don't have any more space on the VMU that I bought.
[19559.46s -> 19562.34s]  Which, shame on the place that I got it from.
[19564.47s -> 19566.79s]  Because they didn't even have the wherewithal
[19567.43s -> 19568.63s]  to remove the shit that was,
[19568.63s -> 19569.67s]  oh, hold on a second.
[19569.67s -> 19570.39s]  I gotta pay attention.
[19571.03s -> 19573.83s]  There's a bunch of random games
[19573.83s -> 19576.71s]  that are still on here from some dude in like 1998.
[19577.51s -> 19580.34s]  I don't have any powers.
[19583.29s -> 19584.25s]  I can fire.
[19584.25s -> 19584.65s]  What?
[19584.65s -> 19585.05s]  Water?
[19588.97s -> 19590.65s]  Where is this camera located?
[19600.26s -> 19601.62s]  That was my responsibility?
[19601.62s -> 19604.58s]  No, it's the responsibility of when it comes into used
[19605.30s -> 19607.78s]  and somebody selling it used, you wipe it.
[19608.58s -> 19610.82s]  I don't want your like fucking tabs on here.
[19610.82s -> 19613.22s]  I don't want your like internet cache on here.
[19614.26s -> 19628.33s]  I actually think I'm pretty good right now.
[19629.05s -> 19631.26s]  Nobody can hurt me.
[19633.37s -> 19636.68s]  Crab doesn't do very much.
[19637.32s -> 19639.91s]  Okay, we're fine.
[19643.35s -> 19646.23s]  I love looking at what the mystery person played on their Dreamcast.
[19648.14s -> 19651.58s]  Yeah, it's all right though.
[19651.58s -> 19653.90s]  I think I can actually do something interesting here.
[19653.90s -> 19654.94s]  I think I can pull this out
[19655.66s -> 19658.62s]  and delete stuff off of it handheld.
[19662.06s -> 19664.14s]  I have so much EVP points.
[19664.78s -> 19669.00s]  Let's see if we can make something happen.
[19675.86s -> 19677.30s]  Equip that body.
[19677.30s -> 19682.07s]  No, I'm not there yet.
[19687.19s -> 19688.87s]  I can't do demon arm either, guys.
[19697.86s -> 19698.18s]  Land?
[19698.18s -> 19698.50s]  Can I?
[19698.50s -> 19698.82s]  I can't.
[19706.23s -> 19706.63s]  Uh-oh.
[19707.67s -> 19708.31s]  That's it.
[19708.31s -> 19709.83s]  I don't want to get killed here.
[19710.63s -> 19710.95s]  Got it.
[19722.22s -> 19724.62s]  You can walk on land with the leg, but hold on.
[19724.62s -> 19726.06s]  Just wait one second.
[19726.06s -> 19726.38s]  Oops.
[19727.93s -> 19729.45s]  These guys killed me in one hit before too.
[19730.01s -> 19733.37s]  What the hell is hitting me?
[19742.10s -> 19747.08s]  I'm not going to do any evolution stuff until I have at least 50 of these.
[19749.18s -> 19749.58s]  That's right.
[19749.58s -> 19750.22s]  You heard that.
[19750.22s -> 19751.34s]  Don't adjust your audio there.
[19751.34s -> 19752.22s]  That was five zero.
[19752.94s -> 19768.73s]  I wonder how many people were watching
[19769.83s -> 19772.39s]  that we got to the point where that was arm level two
[19772.39s -> 19776.87s]  like the 15th time and they were secretly hoping.
[19776.87s -> 19777.43s]  Oh man.
[19777.43s -> 19779.27s]  I hope he does not actually get out of this.
[19779.99s -> 19781.35s]  I hope he rage quits the game.
[19782.55s -> 19783.59s]  Where's Tony Hawk?
[19784.23s -> 19785.35s]  I would say it too, probably.
[19786.23s -> 19787.11s]  In fact, I think I did.
[19801.27s -> 19801.99s]  Where's Seaman?
[19801.99s -> 19803.67s]  I'll explain Seaman again.
[19804.31s -> 19805.43s]  I was going to play that today.
[19806.63s -> 19808.31s]  Unfortunately though, when I bought it,
[19809.43s -> 19810.31s]  where I bought it from,
[19810.31s -> 19813.27s]  the person did not put the mic in the package.
[19814.23s -> 19815.51s]  That was just the game.
[19815.51s -> 19817.19s]  And the game doesn't do anything without the mic.
[19818.97s -> 19819.61s]  Unfortunately.
[19820.33s -> 19824.20s]  Okay.
[19824.20s -> 19825.56s]  I got 25 of these.
[19829.16s -> 19829.48s]  All right.
[19829.48s -> 19830.60s]  I need something interesting.
[19830.60s -> 19840.31s]  How about we do guy eating cheese or cheese eating a guy.
[19841.03s -> 19842.44s]  Flip it on him.
[19842.44s -> 19853.18s]  I mean, you messed it up.
[19853.18s -> 19853.98s]  You messed it up.
[19853.98s -> 19854.70s]  You messed it up.
[19855.34s -> 19858.65s]  You can walk on land with these.
[19859.45s -> 19861.86s]  Wait.
[19861.86s -> 19862.74s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[19862.74s -> 19863.22s]  Easy.
[19863.22s -> 19868.98s]  What Pac-Man is a good one too.
[19869.78s -> 19876.41s]  How did I screw this up last time?
[19876.41s -> 19882.82s]  It's one in the middle here.
[19883.46s -> 19883.86s]  That's it.
[19884.66s -> 19886.18s]  Yeah, that's it.
[19886.18s -> 19887.38s]  So you tell me this is something else.
[19888.02s -> 19900.38s]  Is it different?
[19900.38s -> 19915.64s]  Thanks for dumping my protein powder in the sink.
[19919.10s -> 19919.82s]  All right.
[19919.82s -> 19927.24s]  I was going to eat that and go get a pump on, man.
[19927.24s -> 19927.48s]  All right.
[19927.48s -> 19933.77s]  Let's go with Metroa.
[19933.77s -> 19944.47s]  How about what have I used so far?
[19944.47s -> 19944.79s]  Let me see.
[19944.79s -> 19946.23s]  I got plenty of options.
[19946.23s -> 19950.47s]  Get Minecraft Steve, Pac-Man, Pac-Man.
[19961.34s -> 19962.06s]  I got to get this right.
[19962.78s -> 20016.09s]  Is there a green ghost?
[20016.09s -> 20033.43s]  He's going up and eating them.
[20033.43s -> 20057.26s]  Should I do the whole background black?
[20057.26s -> 20059.54s]  He's a circle.
[20059.54s -> 20060.90s]  He's turning.
[20060.90s -> 20062.50s]  He's turning up top left.
[20063.06s -> 20064.58s]  And opening his mouth and going that way.
[20088.66s -> 20089.78s]  Simple shapes.
[20090.78s -> 20091.10s]  Okay.
[20094.28s -> 20095.40s]  What's the point of having this
[20095.40s -> 20098.20s]  if I have to do like two squares and then go?
[20100.65s -> 20102.81s]  Oh, well, that's a fun fucking game.
[20114.55s -> 20115.43s]  What is it?
[20115.43s -> 20136.65s]  You fucking assholes.
[20136.65s -> 20139.11s]  Unbelievable.
[20139.11s -> 20140.95s]  Now you're going to gnome me after that shit?
[20144.71s -> 20145.43s]  Why?
[20145.43s -> 20147.38s]  Why would you do that?
[20147.38s -> 20147.86s]  Whatever.
[20147.86s -> 20148.10s]  Okay.
[20148.97s -> 20149.85s]  Stab Scorpion.
[20149.85s -> 20162.97s]  I need two more.
[20162.97s -> 20165.29s]  Level 11 by two black squares.
[20171.40s -> 20171.80s]  Draw.
[20171.80s -> 20172.68s]  Yeah. Okay. Fine.
[20173.32s -> 20175.75s]  Draw the gnome.
[20176.31s -> 20180.90s]  No, I'm just going to do this.
[20181.62s -> 20184.58s]  This is the dumbest game ever.
[20184.58s -> 20185.22s]  This is stupid.
[20205.75s -> 20211.78s]  I spent the last hour and a half just trying to figure out like,
[20211.78s -> 20215.86s]  oh, draw stuff and maybe do a pizza, a guy, a design, a shape.
[20216.42s -> 20217.14s]  Try this shape.
[20217.14s -> 20218.10s]  How about these shapes?
[20218.82s -> 20223.85s]  No, just do two squares and get a level 11 and 19.
[20230.92s -> 20232.28s]  Draw the American flag.
[20236.50s -> 20236.74s]  Okay.
[20267.58s -> 20269.98s]  I got lizard legs and I got monkey legs.
[20271.82s -> 20274.82s]  It's time to walk on land.
[20280.14s -> 20281.66s]  Too many squares.
[20284.89s -> 20289.06s]  It's really about the minimalist approach of one or two dots.
[20289.78s -> 20300.38s]  What do I have right now?
[20301.10s -> 20309.86s]  Eat the blobs for protein?
[20309.86s -> 20310.50s]  Yeah.
[20310.50s -> 20311.78s]  I'm just spawning random places.
[20318.47s -> 20319.59s]  God damn it.
[20319.59s -> 20324.70s]  All that time wasted trying to...
[20326.62s -> 20328.86s]  All we had to do is two dots.
[20329.50s -> 20334.74s]  What do I have right now?
[20336.20s -> 20337.96s]  49. Is that close?
[20338.84s -> 20340.52s]  Lizard Rex, 59.
[20340.52s -> 20341.24s]  67.
[20341.80s -> 20343.56s]  I think I can put on something else though.
[20343.56s -> 20344.28s]  What's the body?
[20344.28s -> 20344.60s]  10.
[20345.16s -> 20345.56s]  Okay.
[20345.56s -> 20346.44s]  Scorpion body.
[20347.32s -> 20358.73s]  I might be almost ready to fight that giant slug in the other room.
[20360.70s -> 20361.66s]  Not quite.
[20361.66s -> 20365.82s]  I need some more protein packs.
[20372.84s -> 20374.36s]  I demand bean bag Sonic.
[20375.00s -> 20379.45s]  I'm not sure we can make bean bag Sonic.
[20382.50s -> 20385.94s]  If you walk on land, I will sub for five months consecutively.
[20386.74s -> 20390.54s]  I gotta do that now.
[20390.54s -> 20398.66s]  I'm gonna get on land.
[20398.66s -> 20399.14s]  It's gonna happen.
[20399.14s -> 20400.26s]  We have the legs already.
[20409.14s -> 20410.02s]  Protein blobs.
[20413.29s -> 20414.49s]  My brain is stuck over here.
[20416.09s -> 20417.86s]  Why is my health low?
[20417.86s -> 20418.74s]  Yeah, that doesn't make any sense.
[20419.46s -> 20428.15s]  Do I have a heal?
[20430.81s -> 20432.57s]  Water first, water second.
[20433.13s -> 20436.63s]  Does I have a better water ability now?
[20437.19s -> 20437.83s]  Let's try it out.
[20439.05s -> 20439.61s]  Water two.
[20440.33s -> 20444.06s]  Pretty good.
[20444.70s -> 20452.25s]  This guy over here.
[20452.97s -> 20453.77s]  I hear a crab.
[20453.77s -> 20454.97s]  Crabs are still dangerous.
[20460.39s -> 20463.13s]  And I think we're looking upside down right now.
[20466.42s -> 20469.38s]  If you max out your creature, I will sub for 12 months.
[20469.38s -> 20470.50s]  I don't know if that's gonna happen.
[20471.22s -> 20472.36s]  Another crab.
[20473.08s -> 20483.96s]  I'll be happy as long as we got out of that stupid little pond in the beginning.
[20483.96s -> 20485.08s]  No, I gotta get out of this pond.
[20485.64s -> 20486.76s]  It's very important.
[20496.30s -> 20499.50s]  If I beat this game, you will give me 1.2 million dollars.
[20503.90s -> 20507.34s]  If that were real, that's the easiest money anyone could ever make.
[20509.82s -> 20511.42s]  That's a very bad investment.
[20511.42s -> 20514.62s]  I'm gonna tell you that that's a not sound use of your money.
[20514.62s -> 20515.90s]  I would refrain.
[20515.90s -> 20517.58s]  I'd say refrain from doing that.
[20517.58s -> 20521.75s]  Let's see.
[20522.47s -> 20524.23s]  There's one red dot in the middle.
[20525.03s -> 20531.16s]  Let's go with green dot.
[20531.16s -> 20532.68s]  We're gonna go green in the corners.
[20533.56s -> 20535.88s]  Oh no, green like this.
[20539.64s -> 20540.84s]  Arm 25.
[20547.08s -> 20547.48s]  Yellow.
[20548.12s -> 20554.42s]  Head 12.
[20554.42s -> 20556.89s]  That's pretty good actually.
[20556.89s -> 20558.33s]  And we're gonna go blue.
[20559.37s -> 20564.28s]  Blue in each corner.
[20569.93s -> 20570.97s]  Arm 25 again.
[20571.61s -> 20573.48s]  At least we have a lot to look at.
[20574.12s -> 20578.74s]  Let's see.
[20582.58s -> 20582.82s]  Head.
[20583.94s -> 20584.66s]  Lizard head.
[20585.38s -> 20587.32s]  Can't use it yet still.
[20588.82s -> 20589.14s]  Why?
[20589.14s -> 20589.54s]  Why not?
[20590.10s -> 20593.10s]  Prot 66?
[20593.90s -> 20604.15s]  Lizard Rex.
[20606.20s -> 20607.80s]  I'm not sure I'm understanding this though.
[20608.44s -> 20617.13s]  So I can't wear these because I have 60 too, right?
[20617.69s -> 20619.66s]  So if this was minus...
[20624.06s -> 20627.40s]  If this was minus 60, wouldn't it put me at two?
[20628.20s -> 20642.50s]  You have zero.
[20643.30s -> 20645.54s]  So I'd have to take it off of other places.
[20647.29s -> 20647.85s]  I see.
[20647.85s -> 20648.17s]  Okay.
[20648.89s -> 20659.29s]  Your fish sucks.
[20660.65s -> 20665.10s]  I wonder if I can fight that slug over there.
[20668.50s -> 20669.54s]  Ah, hello, hello, hello.
[20669.54s -> 20671.06s]  Let me have the control of my character please.
[20671.78s -> 20682.95s]  All right.
[20682.95s -> 20685.35s]  Let's see if I can unequip a few things and walk around.
[20685.35s -> 20688.62s]  Because I'm just curious.
[20689.75s -> 20691.19s]  So if I take off the arms...
[20691.99s -> 20694.71s]  That leaves me with a K 11 and a 7.
[20694.71s -> 20695.27s]  All right, I get it.
[20695.27s -> 20695.59s]  I see.
[20697.02s -> 20698.38s]  Take off like the body too.
[20704.20s -> 20705.24s]  Just want to see what happens.
[20712.34s -> 20712.98s]  Legs.
[20712.98s -> 20713.46s]  Lizard.
[20714.02s -> 20715.50s]  Eyes 42.
[20715.50s -> 20716.30s]  I still can't do it.
[20716.86s -> 20717.90s]  I need 112.
[20718.54s -> 20725.98s]  I can put the lizard head on though.
[20726.70s -> 20735.43s]  I'm not sure it's worth having that.
[20743.80s -> 20744.52s]  I don't think so.
[20746.62s -> 20747.66s]  Yeah, this thing sucks.
[20748.22s -> 20758.14s]  Put the high fish, the stab, scorpion arms.
[20758.14s -> 20758.62s]  Wait a minute.
[20763.18s -> 20764.62s]  Oh boy.
[20764.62s -> 20768.30s]  I think I'm ready to tumble.
[20772.30s -> 20772.78s]  Whatever.
[20772.78s -> 20773.98s]  What's my attack?
[20773.98s -> 20779.22s]  I got still the high fish and it's done with the body.
[20779.86s -> 20781.72s]  But what's better?
[20782.60s -> 20786.12s]  Having higher defense or having a huge amount of offense right now?
[20786.84s -> 20788.36s]  Probably the defense.
[20789.08s -> 20792.25s]  I mean, that's a huge increase, but I still have to stab shit.
[20798.46s -> 20798.70s]  Yeah.
[20801.06s -> 20801.86s]  All right.
[20801.86s -> 20802.74s]  Let's try to fight the boss.
[20803.54s -> 20808.98s]  I got everything equipped.
[20808.98s -> 20809.78s]  All my arms.
[20809.78s -> 20811.14s]  No, I can't do any other arms.
[20813.16s -> 20813.72s]  Nope.
[20813.72s -> 20815.61s]  Just desert bone.
[20815.61s -> 20815.93s]  All right.
[20816.57s -> 20818.97s]  Let's go fight the boss after I get healed.
[20823.10s -> 20824.06s]  Do I have good spells?
[20825.61s -> 20826.33s]  I have water.
[20826.33s -> 20828.09s]  I've got the level 30 water one.
[20828.81s -> 20830.09s]  I'm sure that's going to do some damage.
[20830.89s -> 20844.57s]  I guess I could just run through more protein blobs.
[20850.25s -> 20854.73s]  If I get one shot, you better believe that I'm going immediately to the next game.
[20856.58s -> 20857.62s]  Absolutely positive.
[20859.06s -> 20865.00s]  Because that would be so sad.
[20872.57s -> 20873.37s]  What is this game?
[20873.37s -> 20874.73s]  This game is for the Dreamcast.
[20874.73s -> 20879.22s]  It's called, I don't know why I was just going to say Steins Gate.
[20879.78s -> 20881.05s]  That's not what this is.
[20881.61s -> 20883.72s]  They're not even remotely similar.
[20886.87s -> 20888.23s]  Save before the boss.
[20888.23s -> 20888.71s]  Okay, hold on.
[20888.71s -> 20889.91s]  Let me see if this is even possible.
[20889.91s -> 20892.63s]  Can I just pull out the fucking EMP device?
[20893.35s -> 20894.71s]  This ain't going to crash my game, right?
[20897.46s -> 20897.86s]  Shouldn't.
[20899.77s -> 20902.89s]  Because I can go through this and like delete shit.
[20907.05s -> 20908.09s]  Okay, here we go.
[20908.09s -> 20911.38s]  I can turn this on.
[20912.02s -> 20916.38s]  How do I turn this shit on?
[20920.07s -> 20921.99s]  Can you act to access the Dreamcast screen?
[20927.42s -> 20929.42s]  Do I have a second Dreamcast I can plug in?
[20929.42s -> 20933.13s]  It needs batteries.
[20933.13s -> 20934.01s]  Oh, fuck.
[20934.01s -> 20934.25s]  Okay.
[20935.13s -> 20939.00s]  I think the battery is already in here, aren't there?
[20939.64s -> 20943.24s]  It's okay.
[20943.24s -> 20944.12s]  I'll get that.
[20944.12s -> 20945.48s]  When I take my next break,
[20945.48s -> 20946.20s]  I'm not going to die.
[20948.04s -> 20949.00s]  I'll grab some batteries.
[20960.10s -> 20961.86s]  That beep means it has none.
[20961.86s -> 20962.18s]  Okay.
[20962.82s -> 20964.34s]  It's good to know.
[20964.90s -> 20976.02s]  D'erba is taking longer to grow legs than actual prehistoric beings.
[20977.06s -> 20978.10s]  All right, I'm getting stuck.
[20978.82s -> 20980.78s]  Crab doesn't even hurt anymore.
[20981.94s -> 20983.06s]  Look at how far we've come.
[20983.78s -> 20993.61s]  Please, batteries, save us from this hell.
[20994.49s -> 20999.62s]  Now, I am a crab now.
[20999.62s -> 21000.02s]  That's right.
[21001.06s -> 21008.65s]  Okay, I need protein blobs.
[21009.85s -> 21011.45s]  You're not really going to come at me, are you?
[21012.41s -> 21015.38s]  Just go fight the boss.
[21015.38s -> 21016.18s]  I need batteries.
[21016.18s -> 21016.98s]  I can't do that yet.
[21025.51s -> 21026.71s]  What kind of batteries go in here?
[21028.65s -> 21030.25s]  They're not like AA or AAA.
[21030.25s -> 21031.53s]  Is it like a watch battery?
[21032.17s -> 21040.55s]  What do I got for the prod?
[21040.55s -> 21047.77s]  Where is my prod?
[21047.77s -> 21048.57s]  It's not even on here.
[21054.78s -> 21056.14s]  It's a quadruple A.
[21066.55s -> 21067.91s]  I haven't ran into any blobs.
[21068.55s -> 21075.91s]  For some reason, there's no audio anymore.
[21076.47s -> 21078.02s]  Okay, there it is now.
[21082.60s -> 21084.12s]  Go to Walmart and get them.
[21084.68s -> 21085.80s]  No, we just can't lose.
[21086.52s -> 21087.48s]  I'm not going to lose.
[21088.04s -> 21089.32s]  That's all that has to happen.
[21089.96s -> 21097.19s]  Where are these stupid blobs?
[21100.92s -> 21102.84s]  Finally, it took you ages to spawn.
[21103.48s -> 21114.89s]  What do I got now?
[21114.89s -> 21115.93s]  All right, I'm going in.
[21115.93s -> 21117.70s]  I'm going in.
[21117.70s -> 21119.35s]  Let's go.
[21119.35s -> 21119.83s]  I'm ready.
[21127.22s -> 21127.86s]  Really?
[21127.86s -> 21147.43s]  Water 2.
[21147.99s -> 21149.08s]  Bingo.
[21149.82s -> 21150.46s]  Dead.
[21150.46s -> 21150.86s]  One hit.
[21151.42s -> 21154.30s]  Where's my character?
[21154.30s -> 21155.66s]  Why don't I have control of the character?
[21155.66s -> 21156.14s]  I'm fine.
[21156.14s -> 21157.18s]  Look at that.
[21157.18s -> 21167.03s]  It's okay.
[21167.03s -> 21168.15s]  It's all right.
[21168.15s -> 21168.95s]  We're trading hits.
[21173.90s -> 21178.07s]  Dead.
[21178.07s -> 21183.88s]  I'm going to run out of shit here.
[21183.88s -> 21185.64s]  What the fucking god damn it?
[21185.64s -> 21186.92s]  Come on, why?
[21186.92s -> 21187.72s]  What the hell?
[21195.91s -> 21197.75s]  Back it up, that's it.
[21197.75s -> 21203.43s]  Okay, I have a heal too.
[21203.43s -> 21205.27s]  Look at all these random powers.
[21205.27s -> 21209.34s]  How do I get EP back?
[21209.34s -> 21226.30s]  I wonder what's most effective against the slug.
[21229.14s -> 21231.99s]  Fire, lightning.
[21235.06s -> 21238.02s]  Water 2 does a lot of, I would assume it's way more damage.
[21244.02s -> 21245.70s]  Use lightning and make you both crispy.
[21245.70s -> 21246.34s]  Yeah, that would happen.
[21246.34s -> 21247.38s]  All right, I got to get out of the menu.
[21249.70s -> 21250.58s]  All right, let's go.
[21252.49s -> 21254.41s]  I am going to heal though one more time to get to full health.
[21263.24s -> 21264.76s]  I wasn't taking very much damage there.
[21265.40s -> 21268.28s]  And I do have a heal so I can run around in a circle.
[21274.28s -> 21275.32s]  You are just pathetic.
[21278.81s -> 21279.53s]  I remember you too.
[21280.47s -> 21283.75s]  I did like a YouTuber scream when you guys came over that first time.
[21283.75s -> 21284.23s]  Not now.
[21287.16s -> 21293.78s]  I can't get the cursor to attack to go over you.
[21297.85s -> 21298.89s]  Get over here.
[21298.89s -> 21299.21s]  Okay.
[21300.09s -> 21303.50s]  Yeah, I've got power now.
[21305.98s -> 21308.54s]  And once we beat this boss, we get to unlock the next zone.
[21309.26s -> 21313.75s]  And then I get to put on the monkey legs.
[21314.31s -> 21315.78s]  Let's try it again.
[21315.78s -> 21316.28s]  Lightning.
[21316.90s -> 21332.34s]  Thankfully, the internet has gotten back to normal.
[21332.98s -> 21334.52s]  All right, lightning one.
[21339.69s -> 21341.61s]  A little zap.
[21342.17s -> 21344.50s]  I'm going to take a hit here.
[21344.50s -> 21345.06s]  That's fine.
[21349.40s -> 21352.84s]  I thought that the disc reading that you thought was my heavy breathing.
[21353.96s -> 21369.00s]  Watch out for the fucking cave entrance.
[21369.72s -> 21373.85s]  Oh boy.
[21374.65s -> 21378.33s]  Like I probably would have been able to trade blows back and forth.
[21378.33s -> 21379.29s]  Why is that even in the game?
[21380.17s -> 21382.90s]  I'll tell you, I can tank the hits at close.
[21386.12s -> 21387.72s]  He's barely hurting me up close.
[21388.60s -> 21389.48s]  He's dead.
[21389.48s -> 21389.80s]  I win.
[21389.80s -> 21390.84s]  Everyone thought I was going to lose.
[21390.84s -> 21391.64s]  You all thought I was done.
[21391.64s -> 21392.28s]  You thought I lost.
[21392.28s -> 21393.40s]  You thought the game was over.
[21393.40s -> 21393.80s]  I win.
[21394.68s -> 21397.56s]  And I'm going to eat him.
[21398.20s -> 21400.47s]  I just ate his whole body.
[21401.03s -> 21402.63s]  That's going to be at least like 500 points.
[21403.19s -> 21412.36s]  And I was going to touch the stones from Diablo.
[21412.36s -> 21412.92s]  Teleport.
[21412.92s -> 21413.48s]  Evolution.
[21446.52s -> 21447.02s]  No!
[21463.11s -> 21470.65s]  I'm not ready for this.
[21470.65s -> 21471.29s]  Can I go back?
[21472.41s -> 21478.71s]  I'm not ready.
[21478.71s -> 21479.59s]  I can.
[21479.59s -> 21488.36s]  Let's try maybe...
[21489.32s -> 21490.68s]  We haven't really done very much red.
[21490.68s -> 21491.96s]  That's not been very much red at all.
[21492.84s -> 21503.69s]  Arm 16.
[21504.49s -> 21521.03s]  Arm 16.
[21528.50s -> 21528.98s]  Too many.
[21528.98s -> 21529.62s]  Too many dots.
[21529.62s -> 21530.18s]  Too many.
[21530.18s -> 21530.90s]  Green and white.
[21538.97s -> 21540.09s]  Head 28.
[21540.73s -> 21542.81s]  I need more body.
[21542.81s -> 21549.10s]  I only have two bodies.
[21549.74s -> 21553.82s]  Red and blue.
[21566.58s -> 21567.06s]  There it is.
[21567.06s -> 21567.86s]  Body 15.
[21568.50s -> 21568.90s]  Perfect.
[21569.46s -> 21571.30s]  I can do another one.
[21571.30s -> 21577.66s]  I can do one more.
[21577.66s -> 21578.38s]  Yellow and blue.
[21578.94s -> 21580.06s]  Try yellow, blue down here.
[21581.46s -> 21585.48s]  Three yellows and then blue tipos.
[21588.12s -> 21589.08s]  Head 13.
[21589.08s -> 21589.40s]  All right.
[21591.10s -> 21592.78s]  Can you explain what you're doing right now?
[21594.39s -> 21597.43s]  Well, essentially, I have no idea.
[21597.83s -> 21599.03s]  I couldn't tell you if I tried.
[21600.98s -> 21603.54s]  I have absolutely no explanation for what's happening in the game.
[21606.60s -> 21608.84s]  How it works, I guess, is you have a grid.
[21608.84s -> 21612.76s]  It's a DNA algorithm where you have stats.
[21612.76s -> 21614.84s]  All the different colors are stats.
[21614.84s -> 21620.12s]  You pick stats in the beginning of the game based on a color's attack.
[21620.12s -> 21621.88s]  For instance, like offense is red.
[21622.68s -> 21623.72s]  Defense is blue.
[21624.36s -> 21627.48s]  And then you use the grid here to make body parts
[21628.04s -> 21632.52s]  when you get enough protein or EVP, especially protein.
[21634.04s -> 21636.68s]  And then you put together and then you make a body part,
[21636.68s -> 21639.64s]  which you have whatever it is.
[21642.42s -> 21642.58s]  All right.
[21642.58s -> 21644.50s]  So we've got lizard, head, lizard, Rex.
[21645.38s -> 21647.59s]  Crystal is the head.
[21647.59s -> 21648.39s]  So lizard.
[21649.43s -> 21650.39s]  Still can't put it on.
[21650.39s -> 21654.18s]  I've got new arms too.
[21654.18s -> 21655.06s]  Stab scorpion.
[21655.06s -> 21656.58s]  Electric mollusk.
[21656.58s -> 21657.86s]  I can just, no, I can't.
[21658.74s -> 21661.19s]  Electric mollusk and demon.
[21661.19s -> 21662.47s]  Electric mollusk sounds kind of cool.
[21663.59s -> 21664.47s]  That's a huge attack.
[21668.49s -> 21669.53s]  Hammer lobster.
[21670.41s -> 21673.16s]  Well, that's quite a defense increase.
[21673.16s -> 21674.44s]  And that's a much better heal.
[21676.26s -> 21681.08s]  I'm going to say it's probably worth it.
[21681.08s -> 21685.91s]  There's one more, right?
[21687.69s -> 21688.41s]  Lizard, Rex.
[21689.05s -> 21700.73s]  I feel like I need a PhD to understand this.
[21701.37s -> 21702.92s]  Hey, I, yeah.
[21703.80s -> 21704.84s]  Let me just take a quick look.
[21712.76s -> 21713.24s]  It's okay.
[21713.24s -> 21714.44s]  The organisms are idiots.
[21715.32s -> 21721.61s]  They can't even hurt me.
[21724.54s -> 21725.02s]  We're fine.
[21725.58s -> 21726.81s]  Oh God.
[21726.81s -> 21727.61s]  What's that?
[21727.61s -> 21728.17s]  What's that thing?
[21728.89s -> 21742.30s]  I do want more protein though.
[21745.61s -> 21747.53s]  It just, it seems so rare.
[21750.10s -> 21750.74s]  What is this?
[21751.38s -> 21767.48s]  I think it's just another area.
[21767.48s -> 21770.73s]  Yeah, we're out of the pond now, guys.
[21771.37s -> 21774.22s]  There's more than one zone.
[21774.22s -> 21782.58s]  I'm going to get so lost.
[21791.74s -> 21792.70s]  Still no protein.
[21800.34s -> 21801.86s]  Where's the protein?
[21801.86s -> 21802.42s]  Anywhere?
[21803.43s -> 21804.23s]  Come on.
[21804.23s -> 21805.67s]  I'm dying here.
[21805.67s -> 21820.60s]  There's another random little enemy.
[21820.60s -> 21821.40s]  Oof.
[21821.40s -> 21825.37s]  This is, this is not going well here with the frame rate.
[21832.17s -> 21833.29s]  Spear nose.
[21833.29s -> 21836.76s]  It barely hurts.
[21838.28s -> 21838.92s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[21838.92s -> 21839.40s]  Just attack.
[21840.12s -> 21846.01s]  You can't, nobody can hurt me.
[21846.65s -> 21848.38s]  Am I overleveled?
[21849.34s -> 21863.86s]  There was another one.
[21869.13s -> 21872.74s]  Why did I, I just got really bored right now.
[21872.74s -> 21874.42s]  It just happened right this second.
[21874.42s -> 21891.16s]  Look at all these things.
[21891.72s -> 21894.60s]  That guy hurts.
[21894.60s -> 21895.80s]  Okay, I gotta run.
[21895.80s -> 21922.22s]  Those guys hurt a lot.
[21922.78s -> 21925.86s]  I'm fine.
[21932.66s -> 21937.34s]  EX power, water, water too.
[21937.34s -> 21942.39s]  Here they come.
[21942.39s -> 21943.27s]  They're still on the way.
[21954.25s -> 21955.45s]  This game is depressing.
[21958.89s -> 21961.85s]  If I could find some more protein, that would be a start.
[21962.49s -> 21972.20s]  I'm just going to keep going.
[21973.40s -> 21974.84s]  At least straight here.
[21977.69s -> 21979.45s]  They went too hard on the gas.
[21979.45s -> 21983.74s]  You're in a pond.
[21983.74s -> 21985.10s]  We were just walking around in the pond.
[21985.66s -> 21991.24s]  And now all of a sudden it's an expansive gigantic ocean with no end.
[21997.03s -> 21998.39s]  Does the compass mean anything?
[22000.14s -> 22001.26s]  I really have no idea.
[22002.06s -> 22005.82s]  Somebody said earlier that it means that there's a food source or something.
[22007.86s -> 22009.62s]  I haven't been able to figure out what the hell that means.
[22010.26s -> 22015.24s]  Now we're going deep sea.
[22016.04s -> 22020.86s]  Oh shit, too deep.
[22021.50s -> 22036.20s]  I need the level 20 flashlight head.
[22036.20s -> 22038.20s]  I think this just might be the end of the game here, the end of the world.
[22039.56s -> 22045.61s]  I just want to put on the monkey legs.
[22046.57s -> 22066.33s]  Monkey legs don't help if they're underwater.
[22067.45s -> 22071.64s]  That's true, but in the same fashion.
[22073.26s -> 22078.68s]  Don't, doesn't somebody gonna sub for five months if I got out of the water?
[22082.42s -> 22084.58s]  Why is that the thing moving me forward?
[22084.58s -> 22089.27s]  Is that protein?
[22096.79s -> 22100.65s]  Damn it.
[22100.65s -> 22101.93s]  Just swim up.
[22102.01s -> 22103.21s]  I can't swim up.
[22103.21s -> 22104.70s]  There's no scale there.
[22108.18s -> 22112.82s]  Well, that was, uh, super evolution.
[22112.82s -> 22113.70s]  I don't know what the game's called.
[22119.21s -> 22121.61s]  Your protein gets drained when you recover HP.
[22121.61s -> 22122.17s]  Does it really?
[22131.08s -> 22134.04s]  You do not go on land in the whole game.
[22144.54s -> 22145.18s]  At least you do.
[22156.14s -> 22159.29s]  I guess that guy's not going to be subbing.
[22159.29s -> 22160.33s]  It doesn't seem like it.
[22161.54s -> 22162.34s]  It's okay.
[22162.34s -> 22172.31s]  This game reminds me of the games my dad played in the 90s.
[22174.07s -> 22177.11s]  That's because it is the game that was made in the 90s.
[22178.31s -> 22181.78s]  It's a 90s game for 90s dads.
[22182.42s -> 22188.25s]  Is there a reason why I can't pick that up?
[22188.25s -> 22189.21s]  I need the monkey legs.
[22195.10s -> 22195.58s]  All right.
[22195.58s -> 22199.98s]  Well, if I can't reliably get some more protein to progress,
[22201.42s -> 22205.10s]  I think we hit the point where it might be time to next the game.
[22207.21s -> 22208.09s]  Interesting concept.
[22209.27s -> 22211.83s]  Wish a game would come out like this that's current gen.
[22219.53s -> 22220.65s]  Thank God.
[22220.65s -> 22220.89s]  What?
[22221.93s -> 22222.65s]  This was fun.
[22224.09s -> 22224.89s]  I had a good time.
[22233.99s -> 22234.71s]  It was worth it.
[22244.94s -> 22246.38s]  So we have a couple options here.
[22250.36s -> 22253.24s]  That was EVP 14.
[22253.24s -> 22253.80s]  No, it's not.
[22253.80s -> 22255.56s]  That's what the screen says.
[22257.29s -> 22257.93s]  Shield your eyes.
[22257.93s -> 22258.25s]  It's going to...
[22258.25s -> 22258.81s]  No, it's not.
[22258.81s -> 22262.10s]  I got it.
[22262.10s -> 22264.82s]  I turned off the stream to watch paint dry.
[22266.10s -> 22278.60s]  And it wasn't as exciting as what I was just doing.
[22278.60s -> 22284.10s]  So there are a couple of survival horror games that remain.
[22285.30s -> 22286.90s]  Tony Hawk is going to be a long time.
[22286.90s -> 22288.10s]  I don't think I'm going to do Tony Hawk.
[22288.10s -> 22292.09s]  I think I'm just going to play Tony Hawk 2 tomorrow.
[22292.09s -> 22293.21s]  Like I'm just going to play the game.
[22293.21s -> 22295.21s]  I'm just going to just beat Tony Hawk 2.
[22296.82s -> 22298.26s]  As that's going to be at least a few hours.
[22303.88s -> 22306.76s]  Blue Stinger is a survival horror game, I believe.
[22314.28s -> 22314.84s]  Power Stone?
[22314.84s -> 22316.12s]  I still got Power Stone as well.
[22316.76s -> 22327.54s]  Why is this sealed so strangely?
[22327.54s -> 22329.62s]  How can one single piece of tape be this powerful?
[22330.34s -> 22334.41s]  What was that game that I just played right now that was...
[22335.21s -> 22335.69s]  That's not...
[22335.69s -> 22336.89s]  It's not the Flogen Brothers.
[22336.89s -> 22337.53s]  I just took it out.
[22338.17s -> 22341.34s]  That was called Seventh Cross Evolution.
[22342.66s -> 22343.78s]  Seventh Cross Evolution.
[22349.64s -> 22350.44s]  Steins Gate.
[22357.86s -> 22359.06s]  I'm not going to snap the disc.
[22359.06s -> 22360.82s]  All these games were at least like...
[22360.82s -> 22363.06s]  At least like 20 to 40 dollars each.
[22363.94s -> 22366.34s]  I'm not snapping a 40 dollar piece of plastic.
[22368.76s -> 22369.56s]  Maybe not that one.
[22373.75s -> 22375.03s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[22375.03s -> 22376.71s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[22376.71s -> 22377.59s]  I'm not doing that.
[22378.97s -> 22380.41s]  I need to go remove shit from this.
[22387.06s -> 22388.02s]  All right, let's see.
[22388.02s -> 22388.42s]  File.
[22391.27s -> 22398.95s]  So we've got NHL 2K Saved Season from the year 2000.
[22398.95s -> 22400.07s]  Okay, we need to get rid of that.
[22405.62s -> 22408.10s]  Star Wars Episode I Jedi Power Battles.
[22414.71s -> 22416.39s]  There is a Pac-Man in here somehow.
[22418.33s -> 22418.89s]  Get rid of that.
[22422.04s -> 22423.08s]  ECW.
[22423.08s -> 22424.52s]  Who's going to play that ever again?
[22424.52s -> 22425.72s]  Namco Museum.
[22425.72s -> 22426.44s]  High score.
[22427.80s -> 22428.76s]  We need these blocks.
[22428.76s -> 22429.40s]  I'm sorry, guys.
[22431.35s -> 22433.35s]  This is Ready to Rumble Boxing.
[22434.31s -> 22434.63s]  Mike.
[22435.19s -> 22435.75s]  Okay.
[22435.75s -> 22442.09s]  And then this is just a saved game options for Ready to Rumble Boxing.
[22442.73s -> 22448.01s]  What do you mean stop?
[22448.57s -> 22471.13s]  What is this asking me to do?
[22471.77s -> 22483.83s]  What does this have to do with a saved game wipe?
[22484.55s -> 22497.77s]  Oh, there's a fork and knife.
[22497.77s -> 22498.73s]  Okay, I get it.
[22498.73s -> 22500.12s]  All right, we're free.
[22500.68s -> 22503.61s]  Ready to go.
[22503.61s -> 22505.61s]  This blue stinger.
[22507.32s -> 22508.52s]  It's going to be so fun.
[22509.08s -> 22511.13s]  Let me pee one more time.
[22512.97s -> 22514.33s]  While this game loads in...
[22514.33s -> 22515.77s]  Actually, no, let me get to the menu first.
[22529.29s -> 22530.25s]  So fun, yeah.
[22532.74s -> 22533.38s]  It's going to be fun.
[22533.38s -> 22541.24s]  What are you talking about?
[22541.32s -> 22542.44s]  Climax Graphics.
[22542.44s -> 22551.03s]  Is this the company?
[22551.03s -> 22551.99s]  Blue Stinger.
[22556.90s -> 22561.35s]  1999.
[22561.35s -> 22562.23s]  So just give me a moment.
[22563.19s -> 22565.91s]  This will probably end up being the last thing we do tonight
[22567.54s -> 22570.34s]  because it is getting to be a little bit later.
[22571.58s -> 22573.98s]  Been about six and a half hours on stream.
[22573.98s -> 22575.34s]  Probably going to go for about seven to eight.
[22576.90s -> 22578.34s]  And we'll pick it up again tomorrow.
[22578.34s -> 22580.58s]  And I'm going to play the absolute shit out of Tony Hawk.
[22581.38s -> 22585.02s]  I will show you a one million point string of tricks.
[22585.98s -> 22592.07s]  You don't think I know how to do manuals.
[22592.55s -> 22593.11s]  We're going to go back.
[22593.11s -> 22594.71s]  I'm going to complete the floor again, brothers.
[22595.83s -> 22596.31s]  Just kidding.
[22596.31s -> 22597.99s]  That's not going to happen.
[22699.70s -> 22741.34s]  All right.
[22741.34s -> 22745.50s]  Blue Stinger.
[22749.37s -> 22749.93s]  What's going on?
[22750.57s -> 22756.60s]  He's breathing.
[22757.24s -> 22765.19s]  Just going to say what?
[22768.86s -> 22769.58s]  What did I do?
[22769.58s -> 22770.78s]  You didn't say you were leaving.
[22771.58s -> 22774.04s]  Didn't I say I had to go pee?
[22775.16s -> 22776.12s]  And I'll be right back?
[22780.36s -> 22782.12s]  I said I have to pee and I'll be right back.
[22790.26s -> 22791.46s]  I cut myself off.
[22791.46s -> 22792.90s]  What did you think I was going to say?
[22797.83s -> 22798.47s]  Difficulty.
[22798.47s -> 22799.03s]  That's fine.
[22800.47s -> 22801.11s]  Blue Stinger.
[22801.83s -> 22804.70s]  You were talking about Floyd again.
[22804.70s -> 22805.02s]  All right.
[22805.02s -> 22805.58s]  Cut scene, cut scene.
[22805.58s -> 22805.98s]  You got to be quiet.
[22805.98s -> 22806.46s]  Is it cut scene?
[22806.46s -> 22807.34s]  Hold on.
[22807.34s -> 22827.62s]  All right.
[22828.50s -> 22830.90s]  I glanced away from the screen and I turned back.
[22830.90s -> 22833.38s]  I didn't expect that helicopter is going to drive into the ground.
[22834.82s -> 22837.32s]  I'm not a pilot of that helicopter.
[22837.32s -> 22838.76s]  Did I just ghost ride it into the ground?
[22843.22s -> 22844.42s]  Nice sneakers too.
[22845.72s -> 22846.52s]  I skipped it.
[22846.52s -> 22847.56s]  I didn't skip anything.
[22848.62s -> 22850.30s]  I didn't skip any cut scenes.
[22850.30s -> 22850.62s]  What?
[22852.90s -> 22855.22s]  I did not skip the intro.
[22855.30s -> 22873.67s]  Those sneakers absolutely look like they've made out of chocolate.
[22874.47s -> 22882.09s]  Those don't look like real shoes.
[22888.38s -> 22888.86s]  Analog.
[22891.46s -> 22892.58s]  I feel like this game is going to be fun.
[22892.58s -> 22892.98s]  Let's go.
[22894.65s -> 22897.50s]  Follow the press the start button.
[22898.74s -> 22900.02s]  This is Elliot Balad.
[22900.02s -> 22902.50s]  Easter Troop C730 over codex.
[22902.50s -> 22903.78s]  This is Janine King.
[22903.78s -> 22906.34s]  KISS Dinosaur Island Security Officer.
[22906.34s -> 22909.88s]  The pilot is under an emergency situation.
[22909.88s -> 22910.84s]  Do you read?
[22910.84s -> 22912.92s]  Dispatch T-70 for rescue.
[22912.92s -> 22915.50s]  The location is-
[22915.50s -> 22917.02s]  I fucking forget to mute the mic.
[22917.02s -> 22917.98s]  I hate that noise.
[22917.98s -> 22918.46s]  Just as much as-
[22918.46s -> 22919.18s]  I got cut off.
[22925.77s -> 22926.09s]  All right.
[22926.09s -> 22927.85s]  I'm Elliot with one L.
[22931.90s -> 22933.93s]  It's Brutus.
[22943.99s -> 22944.87s]  Oh, that guy's not here.
[22945.43s -> 22947.05s]  Is that intentional?
[22947.05s -> 22948.25s]  Yeah.
[22948.25s -> 22949.77s]  You found Small Hassy.
[22954.15s -> 22955.59s]  What was the point of that guy?
[22961.13s -> 22961.69s]  That's it.
[22961.69s -> 22962.73s]  He's just stalking me.
[22963.37s -> 22965.13s]  But apparently he's not.
[22965.77s -> 22969.19s]  All right.
[22969.19s -> 22969.83s]  Through the front door.
[22969.83s -> 22970.15s]  Let's go.
[22970.79s -> 22972.23s]  Another codex call.
[22972.23s -> 22973.11s]  Who is it?
[22973.11s -> 22973.99s]  I repeat.
[22973.99s -> 22975.91s]  I need an EASER unit now.
[22975.91s -> 22976.79s]  Elliot Balad.
[22976.79s -> 22977.35s]  Do you hear me?
[22977.35s -> 22978.71s]  Same damn thing as Ibleed.
[22978.71s -> 22979.83s]  This is Elliot Balad.
[22980.55s -> 22983.99s]  We request D7 equipped rescue unit now.
[22983.99s -> 22984.79s]  The location is-
[22984.79s -> 22985.35s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[22985.35s -> 22986.15s]  Hold on.
[22986.15s -> 22987.43s]  I'm on vacation.
[22987.43s -> 22988.95s]  I'm totally unarmed.
[22988.95s -> 22989.67s]  So-
[22989.67s -> 22989.99s]  So?
[22990.63s -> 22991.75s]  I need help too.
[22992.71s -> 22993.51s]  Oh, great.
[22994.23s -> 22997.34s]  Tell me your location, Elliot.
[22997.34s -> 22998.70s]  Yeah, I have my favorite past time.
[22998.70s -> 22999.90s]  All I can tell you is that-
[22999.90s -> 23002.22s]  Jumping out of helicopters and crashing them into the ground.
[23002.94s -> 23004.07s]  Okay, Elliot.
[23004.07s -> 23005.75s]  First, find an ID card.
[23005.75s -> 23008.15s]  I'm sure there are a number of corpses around.
[23008.15s -> 23010.63s]  You should be able to find one of them with an ID card.
[23013.38s -> 23014.10s]  What happened to her?
[23014.10s -> 23014.58s]  What happened?
[23016.28s -> 23017.08s]  Corpses?
[23017.08s -> 23019.40s]  Did you say there are a number of corpses around?
[23019.40s -> 23019.72s]  Where?
[23028.12s -> 23030.36s]  More diarrhea cramp sounds.
[23030.92s -> 23032.44s]  What's with all the Dreamcast games
[23032.44s -> 23034.28s]  and everybody having stomach ache problems?
[23035.08s -> 23035.32s]  Okay.
[23038.76s -> 23039.32s]  Oh, no.
[23039.32s -> 23039.88s]  Corpses!
[23045.83s -> 23046.55s]  I'll call you back.
[23049.18s -> 23050.38s]  You found a credit card.
[23051.26s -> 23056.58s]  Is there a sprint?
[23061.03s -> 23061.67s]  No.
[23061.67s -> 23069.98s]  What does my shirt say?
[23071.67s -> 23073.16s]  They're gonna get up.
[23073.16s -> 23074.84s]  I thought this was a survival horror game.
[23078.54s -> 23079.74s]  I guess it technically is.
[23080.54s -> 23086.58s]  Except I'm gonna make a reference here.
[23087.22s -> 23088.42s]  No, don't make that reference.
[23089.06s -> 23090.26s]  People are gonna be like, what?
[23090.26s -> 23092.18s]  And then some people are gonna be like, whoa.
[23092.18s -> 23092.98s]  Speaking of-
[23092.98s -> 23093.78s]  Okay, that's-
[23093.78s -> 23094.50s]  There's this is a survive-
[23094.50s -> 23095.06s]  This is a-
[23095.06s -> 23095.54s]  Yeah, it is.
[23096.82s -> 23098.02s]  Oh my god!
[23098.02s -> 23100.02s]  Okay, that was fucking scary.
[23100.02s -> 23102.02s]  No sound, no noise.
[23102.02s -> 23103.38s]  No sound effects.
[23103.38s -> 23104.18s]  Just scary.
[23122.14s -> 23124.38s]  The parental controls are turned off in the options menu.
[23125.02s -> 23125.52s]  Really?
[23127.10s -> 23132.71s]  Alright, door's locked.
[23132.71s -> 23133.51s]  I have the key though, right?
[23134.39s -> 23142.74s]  Yeah, your level four arms couldn't save you.
[23142.74s -> 23143.70s]  Level two arms.
[23155.85s -> 23156.35s]  Jesus!
[23157.21s -> 23162.34s]  Monsters just got way, way cooler.
[23162.34s -> 23163.14s]  Well, there he is.
[23163.14s -> 23164.50s]  This is fucking Wario.
[23165.30s -> 23168.57s]  With his shorts.
[23170.47s -> 23171.35s]  That was close.
[23171.91s -> 23173.11s]  Thanks for helping me.
[23173.11s -> 23174.87s]  My name is Elliot G. Balad.
[23175.75s -> 23176.47s]  Where's Tim?
[23177.75s -> 23180.15s]  Breaking every rule in filmmaking.
[23180.15s -> 23180.65s]  Dogs.
[23181.27s -> 23183.03s]  I'm a captain of the SSDN.
[23183.75s -> 23186.39s]  If you're Elliot, you must be with Tim.
[23186.39s -> 23188.07s]  Breaking every single rule.
[23188.07s -> 23189.03s]  Tim is what?
[23189.75s -> 23190.15s]  Dead?
[23190.15s -> 23192.79s]  You're looking at the same part of the screen.
[23192.79s -> 23193.67s]  I don't know.
[23194.57s -> 23195.53s]  I don't know!
[23196.25s -> 23197.45s]  Is that Aesir's answer?
[23198.62s -> 23202.62s]  You know, Tim once told me he had a high level Aesir member as a friend.
[23204.39s -> 23206.71s]  Where are you going to the island?
[23206.71s -> 23208.31s]  I am still a rescuer.
[23208.31s -> 23210.07s]  There are people there who need help.
[23211.03s -> 23211.75s]  What a joke.
[23211.75s -> 23213.35s]  Just changed to 180 degrees?
[23213.35s -> 23213.83s]  Obviously.
[23213.83s -> 23215.03s]  Why would the camera do that?
[23215.03s -> 23216.31s]  Good help, like me.
[23216.95s -> 23219.35s]  I can't let a wimp like you go alone.
[23219.35s -> 23219.91s]  Whatever.
[23225.42s -> 23231.02s]  The guy's a magician.
[23231.58s -> 23232.14s]  He's just gone.
[23232.94s -> 23237.91s]  He seems to have that ability.
[23237.91s -> 23238.31s]  Somehow.
[23239.83s -> 23241.51s]  You wimp, you'll never make it by yourself.
[23242.87s -> 23246.82s]  Puff of smoke underneath him.
[23254.70s -> 23255.98s]  Go back to the freezer aisle.
[23256.70s -> 23259.18s]  Keep selling fish sticks.
[23261.27s -> 23261.75s]  Gorton.
[23262.31s -> 23263.03s]  How do I get in here?
[23268.71s -> 23270.23s]  That ID card doesn't work?
[23270.23s -> 23270.73s]  No, okay.
[23279.22s -> 23282.58s]  All right, we got some more dead space enemies.
[23282.58s -> 23283.70s]  Magazine of arrows.
[23285.90s -> 23286.40s]  Okay.
[23286.86s -> 23287.96s]  I'm gonna stand up.
[23288.68s -> 23294.50s]  This is already ten times better than the last game.
[23295.77s -> 23297.45s]  He's he just appeared next to me.
[23300.33s -> 23301.77s]  Kill it.
[23302.39s -> 23321.27s]  Is it inceptioning something into my brain here?
[23324.89s -> 23326.33s]  Sell all of your stocks.
[23335.98s -> 23336.48s]  Nephilim.
[23339.05s -> 23340.81s]  The hell is that?
[23340.81s -> 23342.41s]  It was a Nephilim.
[23342.41s -> 23343.29s]  I'm not sure.
[23345.43s -> 23346.79s]  Bad feeling about this.
[23347.51s -> 23350.62s]  Bye.
[23352.44s -> 23358.23s]  It's just Deckard Kane.
[23359.27s -> 23359.77s]  Uh-oh.
[23360.63s -> 23361.35s]  Monster mutant.
[23361.35s -> 23382.38s]  I guess I do.
[23382.38s -> 23382.88s]  Items.
[23384.07s -> 23384.57s]  Food.
[23385.27s -> 23386.50s]  Small Hassy.
[23387.22s -> 23389.54s]  Would you like to have a small Hassy?
[23395.50s -> 23401.03s]  Oh, what was the funny Illbleed story?
[23401.03s -> 23401.53s]  Oh, sorry.
[23402.07s -> 23404.07s]  Now this game kind of just threw me off for a second there.
[23404.07s -> 23406.23s]  So Illbleed is like almost a hundred dollars.
[23406.79s -> 23409.03s]  And I had to cut it because I was thinking of,
[23409.03s -> 23411.43s]  okay, we'll do a Dreamcast night, see how people feel.
[23412.39s -> 23416.14s]  I think Illbleed is like 70 or 80 dollars.
[23416.94s -> 23421.96s]  Good thing I'm in that realm.
[23421.96s -> 23440.28s]  A character from the evolution game.
[23440.28s -> 23443.03s]  I'm gonna get revenge.
[23443.03s -> 23443.53s]  No.
[23443.99s -> 23444.63s]  It's just dead.
[23445.19s -> 23446.15s]  What the hell?
[23447.94s -> 23448.58s]  Over there.
[23449.14s -> 23450.74s]  I am not skipping cutscenes.
[23456.46s -> 23457.58s]  I can't believe it.
[23457.58s -> 23458.78s]  Shooting from that far?
[23458.78s -> 23459.90s]  No shit.
[23461.56s -> 23462.06s]  Janine?
[23463.77s -> 23464.49s]  A woman?
[23471.67s -> 23472.79s]  This is Janine Over.
[23473.51s -> 23475.40s]  This is Janine Over.
[23475.40s -> 23476.28s]  You're great.
[23476.28s -> 23477.24s]  If you're an ESER member,
[23477.32s -> 23479.16s]  you'll definitely be ranked A plus.
[23479.88s -> 23481.00s]  You're flattering me,
[23481.00s -> 23482.60s]  but you won't get anywhere that way.
[23484.25s -> 23487.45s]  You can get in here by taking the slope shuttle in front of you.
[23487.45s -> 23489.37s]  If the shuttle is moving, that is.
[23489.37s -> 23491.85s]  And forget it if you don't have an ID card.
[23492.49s -> 23494.01s]  Oh, where am I gonna get an ID card?
[23495.53s -> 23502.30s]  Phew, tough girl.
[23502.30s -> 23503.18s]  I like it, Janine.
[23503.82s -> 23506.09s]  Who the hell is Janine?
[23506.81s -> 23507.69s]  My kind of girl.
[23507.69s -> 23508.73s]  So stay away from her.
[23512.09s -> 23514.65s]  Uh, that's, um...
[23515.45s -> 23520.17s]  You literally just had a conversation.
[23520.17s -> 23521.53s]  You just saw her from a distance.
[23523.67s -> 23526.47s]  And I believe that was four sentences.
[23527.03s -> 23531.37s]  I think you might want to pump the brakes just a little bit.
[23532.17s -> 23536.26s]  Door's locked.
[23540.52s -> 23543.98s]  I need a key card.
[23552.36s -> 23552.92s]  Gate check.
[23553.88s -> 23555.08s]  Door locked.
[23555.08s -> 23558.47s]  We don't have the card to open this door.
[23565.83s -> 23566.95s]  Push the old guy off.
[23567.67s -> 23572.31s]  Uh, he's not on the screen.
[23572.95s -> 23577.26s]  Did I miss something over here?
[23577.90s -> 23583.22s]  Door's locked.
[23584.10s -> 23596.74s]  Change character.
[23597.38s -> 23603.06s]  This guy's name is Doggs.
[23604.26s -> 23614.60s]  Do I have the key?
[23615.32s -> 23617.24s]  This guy, I thought he was just wearing socks.
[23629.74s -> 23633.14s]  Um, am I stuck here?
[23634.76s -> 23635.72s]  Wasting ammo?
[23636.36s -> 23640.26s]  I don't see anything.
[23640.26s -> 23641.78s]  I mean, map or something?
[23641.78s -> 23647.32s]  There's no info here.
[23647.88s -> 23653.98s]  I mean, this is this.
[23653.98s -> 23655.18s]  I don't think he has the key for this.
[23656.06s -> 23660.52s]  Door's locked.
[23660.52s -> 23663.22s]  There's really only one way to go.
[23673.75s -> 23674.87s]  His defense.
[23674.87s -> 23676.87s]  Everybody wore jorts back in the 90s.
[23680.79s -> 23682.55s]  I'm not so certain they did.
[23683.27s -> 23684.15s]  I don't think they did.
[23692.60s -> 23693.64s]  Well, I did.
[23694.20s -> 23699.93s]  This door's locked.
[23700.95s -> 23701.83s]  Scan your eyes.
[23702.55s -> 23708.46s]  There's no one else to go.
[23709.18s -> 23719.18s]  Is there anything else back here?
[23721.10s -> 23741.43s]  What just happened?
[23741.43s -> 23743.75s]  Uh, I guess I'm gonna go this way.
[23744.79s -> 23751.48s]  No, I don't wear jorts.
[23752.36s -> 23762.98s]  Where is this?
[23762.98s -> 23763.78s]  What is this door?
[23764.90s -> 23766.34s]  There was a room I didn't...
[23766.34s -> 23767.22s]  Okay, to the right?
[23770.57s -> 23771.45s]  Bridge tunnel.
[23773.64s -> 23774.28s]  Tunnel one.
[23775.40s -> 23782.33s]  Is there a place to the right over here?
[23783.13s -> 23794.87s]  I mean, this is the beginning of the game.
[23795.91s -> 23798.74s]  I don't have an indicator on the screen.
[23799.54s -> 23803.06s]  Let me look at the map.
[23803.06s -> 23803.54s]  Do I have a...
[23803.54s -> 23804.82s]  Is there a blip that's supposed to be me?
[23805.78s -> 23807.27s]  I don't think it...
[23807.27s -> 23808.07s]  I don't think it exists.
[23809.78s -> 23832.39s]  Uh, shit!
[23832.95s -> 23833.59s]  Okay, I'm...
[23837.05s -> 23844.09s]  Come on.
[23844.09s -> 23846.01s]  Where's this room that I didn't go in?
[23846.57s -> 23848.06s]  It's not here.
[23848.86s -> 23858.38s]  Can we go back to the ring?
[23859.02s -> 23859.90s]  No, not tonight.
[23860.54s -> 23873.19s]  No, not this way.
[23873.19s -> 23873.75s]  No, right.
[23873.75s -> 23875.35s]  Okay, we're just gonna keep going.
[23876.39s -> 23886.92s]  Continue forward with it.
[23886.92s -> 23888.60s]  Push the crate to the right.
[23890.54s -> 23891.18s]  This crate?
[23891.90s -> 23908.15s]  Why would anyone ever do this?
[23915.72s -> 23917.08s]  Why would you ever move this?
[23917.08s -> 23918.60s]  Why would you even look at this crate?
[23930.22s -> 23931.50s]  He really is Wario.
[23931.50s -> 23932.22s]  Yeah, he just went like...
[23934.46s -> 23937.93s]  There's more than one item up there.
[23939.53s -> 23941.80s]  Is there no ID?
[23942.36s -> 23942.76s]  A gun?
[23944.68s -> 23950.95s]  There's lockers.
[23950.95s -> 23951.91s]  This is a very claustrophobic...
[23951.91s -> 23953.99s]  Do you want to turn to download the map?
[23953.99s -> 23954.47s]  Uh, yeah.
[23955.43s -> 23958.63s]  Okay, download complete.
[23959.19s -> 23962.07s]  I got the map now.
[23963.03s -> 23964.87s]  And there are two items up there, somebody said.
[23965.67s -> 23996.82s]  Here you go!
[23996.82s -> 23998.55s]  So there's another thing...
[23998.55s -> 23999.03s]  What is this?
[24000.63s -> 24002.31s]  You found a handgun magazine, okay.
[24004.52s -> 24005.48s]  All right, let's go.
[24006.36s -> 24007.16s]  Now I can move on.
[24029.14s -> 24030.50s]  Blue Stinger.
[24031.93s -> 24033.53s]  Move on to the next game.
[24033.53s -> 24034.17s]  Hold on, I just...
[24035.21s -> 24037.77s]  I'm almost about to go through the first door I haven't been able to go through.
[24038.65s -> 24041.56s]  Turn off the key.
[24041.56s -> 24042.73s]  The door over this way?
[24043.45s -> 24050.81s]  No, I'm not done.
[24054.78s -> 24055.66s]  That's breaking the rule.
[24062.39s -> 24063.27s]  There we go!
[24063.27s -> 24064.07s]  Through the door.
[24064.79s -> 24069.27s]  There's like tendrils.
[24070.71s -> 24091.59s]  All right, got it.
[24091.59s -> 24093.35s]  This music is going to drive me crazy.
[24093.35s -> 24094.79s]  What's with these Dreamcast games?
[24095.94s -> 24097.78s]  And their EDF soundtracks?
[24112.46s -> 24113.26s]  Can't open this one.
[24117.59s -> 24119.75s]  Or fan-made Star Wars themes.
[24120.31s -> 24124.02s]  There's a huge keypad right here.
[24131.13s -> 24131.93s]  The person is going to get up.
[24131.93s -> 24132.33s]  What's that?
[24133.53s -> 24134.73s]  An magazine of arrows.
[24134.73s -> 24135.21s]  That's good.
[24136.01s -> 24137.22s]  Do you want to download the map?
[24137.22s -> 24137.46s]  Yes.
[24143.58s -> 24144.70s]  Vending machines?
[24144.70s -> 24145.90s]  Display contents of v...
[24145.90s -> 24146.94s]  Oh, it's a save point.
[24147.58s -> 24149.98s]  Do you want to...
[24149.98s -> 24150.94s]  Yes, I do want to save.
[24157.08s -> 24158.04s]  Really, is Wario.
[24159.80s -> 24163.90s]  Select the item you want to buy.
[24166.38s -> 24169.02s]  A hot dog is $120.
[24170.14s -> 24171.58s]  Hamburger $160.
[24173.32s -> 24175.16s]  Or a Hasee is $60.
[24176.12s -> 24184.12s]  Okay, it's an expensive hot dog.
[24185.08s -> 24185.56s]  God damn it.
[24185.56s -> 24186.44s]  Now I want a hot dog.
[24186.44s -> 24187.16s]  I'm hungry now.
[24208.39s -> 24209.03s]  I got the map.
[24209.03s -> 24209.91s]  Where the hell am I?
[24212.17s -> 24213.29s]  Brain area?
[24214.81s -> 24215.21s]  Brain.
[24215.93s -> 24227.74s]  This door is unlocked.
[24227.74s -> 24228.54s]  It can't be unlocked.
[24229.26s -> 24230.87s]  So I went in that way.
[24232.76s -> 24234.04s]  This door is locked.
[24234.04s -> 24235.24s]  So I have to go this way.
[24240.44s -> 24241.24s]  Control room.
[24242.04s -> 24249.94s]  Okay, I threw up the other party member.
[24250.66s -> 24252.02s]  Emergency alert.
[24252.02s -> 24253.78s]  Shuttle section should be stationed.
[24255.13s -> 24256.09s]  Emergency alert.
[24256.09s -> 24256.73s]  I wonder if I've been in Vegas.
[24256.73s -> 24258.17s]  Shuttle section should be stationed.
[24258.17s -> 24259.61s]  It's about four months now.
[24260.41s -> 24263.77s]  Negative pressure on the shuttle holder system has increased 20%.
[24265.77s -> 24269.59s]  The security limitation is exceeded on shuttle system.
[24269.59s -> 24271.35s]  Security break has been activated.
[24272.71s -> 24274.71s]  Shutter outer seal has been broken.
[24274.71s -> 24278.39s]  Once shuttle reaches security limitation stage, shuttle may descend rapidly.
[24283.29s -> 24284.97s]  Hey, somebody is on board.
[24285.53s -> 24286.33s]  He's locked up in the shuttle.
[24286.33s -> 24286.89s]  He screamed.
[24287.53s -> 24292.07s]  Activate the emergency stop control.
[24292.07s -> 24295.59s]  Remember the sound that I've played a couple times now that on the...
[24295.59s -> 24297.19s]  A shaft entrance lock has been deactivated.
[24297.19s -> 24298.95s]  That's the stock sound that I...
[24298.95s -> 24300.63s]  Activate the emergency stop control.
[24300.63s -> 24301.11s]  I'll play it.
[24301.11s -> 24304.31s]  Safety break will be destroyed in 125 seconds.
[24304.31s -> 24306.71s]  A shaft entrance lock has been deactivated.
[24307.27s -> 24309.35s]  Activate the emergency stop control.
[24309.35s -> 24312.63s]  Safety break will be destroyed in 120 seconds.
[24312.63s -> 24315.03s]  A shaft entrance lock has been deactivated.
[24316.73s -> 24317.53s]  That is the bugleberry.
[24317.53s -> 24319.29s]  A shaft entrance lock destroyed.
[24319.29s -> 24320.41s]  The shuttle is going to fall.
[24334.14s -> 24335.10s]  I got a time limit.
[24337.66s -> 24337.98s]  Fuck.
[24338.86s -> 24339.58s]  What do I have to do?
[24339.58s -> 24339.98s]  I didn't...
[24339.98s -> 24341.26s]  I was trying to find a scream.
[24342.06s -> 24354.79s]  Which way do I go?
[24355.35s -> 24357.21s]  This door is unlocked.
[24357.21s -> 24357.53s]  Okay.
[24357.53s -> 24357.69s]  Out.
[24366.41s -> 24366.81s]  Dodge.
[24376.46s -> 24377.66s]  Nice nonchalant running.
[24383.67s -> 24384.47s]  Lots of blood.
[24386.63s -> 24388.15s]  These huge pratfalls.
[24388.79s -> 24389.75s]  That looks painful.
[24390.55s -> 24394.12s]  I'm almost there.
[24397.13s -> 24397.45s]  What?
[24403.24s -> 24403.56s]  Uh...
[24407.40s -> 24408.76s]  Wasn't supposed to go there apparently.
[24412.92s -> 24413.08s]  Oof.
[24413.08s -> 24413.32s]  Oof.
[24413.32s -> 24413.40s]  Oof.
[24413.40s -> 24414.04s]  Oof.
[24414.04s -> 24414.52s]  Ah.
[24414.52s -> 24416.94s]  This...
[24416.94s -> 24417.90s]  I don't do anything here?
[24417.90s -> 24419.34s]  I don't climb up this or anything?
[24419.34s -> 24419.74s]  Nothing?
[24421.10s -> 24421.42s]  Oh.
[24421.42s -> 24453.10s]  Just put them in the pocket for a little while.
[24458.23s -> 24459.19s]  So that was the wrong way.
[24465.98s -> 24466.38s]  Let's see.
[24467.70s -> 24468.42s]  Five.
[24468.42s -> 24468.74s]  Four.
[24469.30s -> 24469.62s]  Three.
[24470.34s -> 24470.58s]  Two.
[24471.46s -> 24471.62s]  One.
[24490.78s -> 24491.26s]  What was that?
[24491.26s -> 24493.02s]  Was that supposed to happen?
[24503.16s -> 24504.68s]  Why was there a countdown for that?
[24512.26s -> 24524.39s]  I guess that was supposed to happen.
[24525.64s -> 24527.00s]  So I walked all the way up here.
[24530.25s -> 24531.45s]  I was supposed to stop it?
[24544.20s -> 24547.56s]  The Dreamcast fucking sucks laughing my ass off.
[24547.56s -> 24550.76s]  I don't know why that's making me laugh so hard.
[24551.32s -> 24551.56s]  Why?
[24556.31s -> 24557.11s]  It doesn't though.
[24565.43s -> 24567.11s]  Dreamcast is a great system.
[24568.47s -> 24569.99s]  We didn't even play Tony Hawk yet.
[24586.17s -> 24587.61s]  Dynamite Cop was awesome.
[24587.61s -> 24588.49s]  You can't deny that.
[24624.22s -> 24624.62s]  Listen.
[24624.62s -> 24627.58s]  We didn't even play Shenmue.
[24628.46s -> 24629.26s]  Shenmue 2.
[24630.38s -> 24631.26s]  Sonic Adventure.
[24631.90s -> 24632.94s]  Space Channel 5.
[24634.89s -> 24635.77s]  Crazy Taxi.
[24636.87s -> 24640.87s]  All of which were ported and run way better on PC now.
[24641.75s -> 24644.07s]  But they were on Dreamcast a long time ago.
[24644.71s -> 24646.84s]  That's what matters.
[24655.75s -> 24657.59s]  What do I have to do here?
[24662.58s -> 24663.30s]  Okay.
[24663.30s -> 24664.74s]  Shuttle A is deactivated.
[24671.18s -> 24672.94s]  Shuttle B is deactivated now.
[24672.94s -> 24674.14s]  Am I gonna get another timer?
[24675.02s -> 24683.05s]  Please just let the Death Star blow up already.
[24691.67s -> 24692.31s]  All right.
[24692.31s -> 24693.27s]  This door is locked.
[24693.27s -> 24694.31s]  How do I open the door?
[24699.85s -> 24700.73s]  Was that actually...
[24701.37s -> 24701.53s]  All right.
[24701.53s -> 24702.33s]  I gotta calm down.
[24703.05s -> 24703.45s]  Hold on.
[24709.62s -> 24710.42s]  Just give me a second.
[24716.10s -> 24717.86s]  I can't mute the music.
[24718.97s -> 24719.93s]  It's impossible.
[24719.93s -> 24721.05s]  I have to mute the whole game.
[24743.80s -> 24744.30s]  Okay.
[24748.63s -> 24749.83s]  I can't get it out of my head.
[24750.55s -> 24751.91s]  I can't get it out.
[24761.88s -> 24762.28s]  Okay.
[24763.35s -> 24765.67s]  So do I have to reload the save?
[24766.47s -> 24799.70s]  I don't know why this is doing it to me so hard.
[24799.70s -> 24800.50s]  I'm sorry.
[24800.50s -> 24801.22s]  I don't know why.
[24802.42s -> 24804.63s]  Let me heal.
[24805.27s -> 24805.83s]  No, I don't want to...
[24805.83s -> 24807.11s]  I'm gonna just get the other guy.
[24807.91s -> 24810.01s]  I'm so sorry.
[24810.01s -> 24811.77s]  I don't know why this is happening right now.
[24817.00s -> 24817.32s]  Okay.
[24817.88s -> 24818.76s]  I'm gonna backtrack.
[24819.32s -> 24824.17s]  My god.
[24824.17s -> 24824.57s]  Okay.
[24824.57s -> 24826.09s]  So that fell down.
[24827.29s -> 24833.67s]  Therefore, I'm gonna turn the music down.
[24834.39s -> 24840.31s]  I gotta mute...
[24860.79s -> 24861.11s]  All right.
[24864.42s -> 24866.74s]  So I downloaded some new maps.
[24867.54s -> 24873.53s]  We got brain area.
[24874.47s -> 24875.03s]  Let me look.
[24875.03s -> 24875.83s]  So that's...
[24875.83s -> 24876.31s]  Where was...
[24877.51s -> 24882.87s]  I'm gonna go check the tunnel that I was in again.
[24884.49s -> 24884.89s]  Okay.
[24884.89s -> 24885.69s]  I'll try.
[24885.69s -> 24886.97s]  Check that slope tunnel again.
[24886.97s -> 24887.21s]  Okay.
[24887.93s -> 24894.38s]  I should've...
[24894.38s -> 24896.06s]  Why did I get this instead of Ill Bleed?
[24919.66s -> 24921.10s]  It's making me laugh so hard because...
[24924.28s -> 24924.68s]  It's just...
[24925.72s -> 24929.24s]  I can smell the boredom coming from that person's comment.
[24929.24s -> 24932.28s]  And like, these are the games that are being shown.
[24932.28s -> 24933.24s]  And if you've never heard...
[24933.24s -> 24935.48s]  If you've never seen the Dreamcast, you've never heard of it before.
[24935.48s -> 24936.04s]  This like...
[24936.04s -> 24936.68s]  This sucks.
[24937.56s -> 24940.17s]  But there's so much more in Dreamcast.
[24940.17s -> 24941.77s]  Dreamcast is like a great system.
[24943.93s -> 24945.37s]  There are actually like at least...
[24946.68s -> 24950.20s]  At least like 10 games that are really fantastic.
[24950.20s -> 24952.20s]  Like genre-defining experiences.
[24953.24s -> 24957.91s]  But anyways, check the slope tunnel again.
[24964.12s -> 24965.24s]  Name three Shenmue.
[24965.96s -> 24966.52s]  Shenmue.
[24967.98s -> 24968.62s]  Power Stone.
[24969.74s -> 24971.02s]  And Dynamite Cop!
[24971.66s -> 24984.82s]  How do I get out of this?
[24989.91s -> 24991.83s]  I have to push the crate up the slope?
[24992.71s -> 24993.35s]  What crate?
[24996.01s -> 24996.73s]  Do something!
[24996.73s -> 24997.37s]  I'm sorry!
[24997.37s -> 24999.61s]  I don't understand!
[24999.61s -> 25001.53s]  The timer ran out and I have nothing to do!
[25014.20s -> 25015.08s]  There's a ladder?
[25015.88s -> 25017.08s]  Where's the ladder?
[25017.08s -> 25030.68s]  On the right side?
[25036.04s -> 25037.96s]  I just passed the ladder on the right side.
[25059.45s -> 25060.97s]  There's a ladder up all the way to the top.
[25071.11s -> 25072.23s]  I got my sound muted.
[25072.23s -> 25073.11s]  Why is he running...
[25073.11s -> 25074.39s]  Okay, I see a ladder here.
[25077.26s -> 25077.82s]  It's just like...
[25077.82s -> 25083.46s]  You're talking about the most chameleon ladder I've ever seen.
[25083.46s -> 25084.90s]  Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[25094.66s -> 25096.58s]  The A shuttle is out of order.
[25096.58s -> 25102.42s]  I'm gonna progress.
[25110.23s -> 25111.51s]  Oh my god.
[25111.51s -> 25113.42s]  Pull?
[25114.06s -> 25115.18s]  Just keep walking?
[25115.18s -> 25125.22s]  Where the hell did I end up?
[25125.22s -> 25125.94s]  What the f...
[25125.94s -> 25126.90s]  Where did you come from?
[25127.46s -> 25136.55s]  I'm gonna have to drink that large hassy in a second.
[25141.43s -> 25142.95s]  Are you gonna kill me?
[25142.95s -> 25143.59s]  You killed me.
[25158.62s -> 25160.06s]  I can't get out of here.
[25160.06s -> 25169.03s]  Oh yeah, I can.
[25169.03s -> 25171.35s]  No, I gotta give this game a...
[25185.94s -> 25187.30s]  No, this game's not...
[25187.30s -> 25188.66s]  This game's fun.
[25188.66s -> 25193.53s]  You give games too many chances.
[25193.53s -> 25195.37s]  No, this is a fun experience.
[25195.37s -> 25197.13s]  It's a genre-defining experience.
[25198.71s -> 25199.59s]  It's been 40 minutes.
[25201.99s -> 25203.19s]  God damn it.
[25203.19s -> 25203.91s]  Has it actually?
[25218.10s -> 25219.62s]  This genre sucks.
[25220.26s -> 25221.54s]  No, it doesn't.
[25221.54s -> 25225.30s]  Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 is best played on the Sega Dreamcast.
[25226.10s -> 25229.46s]  When it came out, it was at the best graphics.
[25230.02s -> 25232.10s]  It was played the best in the best control system.
[25235.06s -> 25236.98s]  Look, I don't want to play the whole cart, you know?
[25237.94s -> 25239.38s]  I told you at the beginning of the stream.
[25239.38s -> 25241.30s]  I got an ace, I got a queen, and I got a ten.
[25243.40s -> 25245.00s]  I don't want you to see the king.
[25245.80s -> 25247.02s]  Or the jack right here.
[25247.74s -> 25248.71s]  Well, the ace...
[25248.71s -> 25249.91s]  No, actually, this is the ace and the king.
[25250.63s -> 25253.35s]  Power Stone and Tony Hawk 2 are probably the best games on the system.
[25261.13s -> 25262.81s]  You've been playing Uno cards.
[25263.61s -> 25267.14s]  No, this one's gonna take a while.
[25267.70s -> 25271.06s]  So what did we go through tonight?
[25271.78s -> 25273.30s]  It's also been seven hours.
[25280.28s -> 25281.96s]  Let me just double check to see for tomorrow.
[25281.96s -> 25282.68s]  Let me take a look.
[25284.25s -> 25287.13s]  We've got an ace, a king, a queen.
[25289.48s -> 25289.96s]  We've got...
[25290.76s -> 25292.04s]  And then two terrible games.
[25292.84s -> 25294.60s]  And then one more survival horror.
[25296.90s -> 25297.62s]  Okay.
[25297.62s -> 25299.32s]  I'm gonna call it here.
[25300.20s -> 25302.36s]  Because it's getting later.
[25302.36s -> 25303.40s]  It's been about seven hours.
[25306.71s -> 25307.83s]  Seaman also...
[25307.83s -> 25308.55s]  I want to...
[25308.55s -> 25309.83s]  I didn't address Seaman.
[25309.83s -> 25312.31s]  I did a couple times, but I want to do it again.
[25312.31s -> 25314.31s]  I was supposed to play Seaman tonight.
[25315.66s -> 25320.14s]  But the microphone did not come in the package where I bought it from.
[25320.14s -> 25321.58s]  They sent me...
[25321.58s -> 25322.22s]  They missed...
[25322.22s -> 25322.94s]  It was missing.
[25323.99s -> 25326.63s]  And it explicitly stated the microphone was in the package.
[25327.59s -> 25329.19s]  So I have to get it again.
[25329.19s -> 25330.07s]  I have to reorder it.
[25333.75s -> 25339.27s]  Anywho, it has to be a specific mic.
[25339.27s -> 25340.47s]  Only one mic works.
[25340.47s -> 25343.27s]  It's the one you plug in to the VMU slot.
[25352.71s -> 25354.79s]  That was a pretty good C minus stream.
[25356.23s -> 25357.43s]  At least it wasn't an F.
[25357.99s -> 25358.71s]  I'll take that.
[25361.83s -> 25369.51s]  Jerma got scammed.
[25370.23s -> 25379.08s]  No, I bought it through Amazon.
[25379.08s -> 25380.12s]  I had fun.
[25380.12s -> 25383.72s]  Dynamite Cop is actually one of the better arcade games.
[25383.72s -> 25384.68s]  I think that was a blast.
[25386.28s -> 25387.08s]  What else did we play?
[25387.96s -> 25389.32s]  ECW was terrible.
[25391.21s -> 25393.77s]  Seventh Cross had potential and it was fun for a little while.
[25394.41s -> 25397.22s]  Floggin Brothers was terrible, but it was still interesting.
[25399.45s -> 25403.32s]  The Ring was barely even a playable video game.
[25404.04s -> 25407.16s]  Floggin was like, all right.
[25407.16s -> 25407.72s]  Yeah, it was.
[25408.86s -> 25411.82s]  So tomorrow, we got the ace and the king.
[25411.82s -> 25414.38s]  We got the real games lined up for tomorrow.
[25416.92s -> 25418.28s]  Power Stone, Tony Hawk 2.
[25418.28s -> 25419.96s]  I'm going to put a ton of time into Tony Hawk 2.
[25420.92s -> 25423.88s]  So be prepared for tomorrow's stream to be
[25424.68s -> 25428.68s]  Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 for like four to six hours.
[25429.56s -> 25432.28s]  And then we'll go through some of these other ones.
[25437.32s -> 25439.16s]  All two good Dreamcast games.
[25445.77s -> 25451.53s]  And by the way, all the other great like Shenmue, Jet Set Radio,
[25453.21s -> 25455.29s]  Space Channel 5, I own them on PC.
[25457.24s -> 25458.84s]  So they're still going to happen.
[25459.64s -> 25463.24s]  It's just I kind of need to get through the ones that are connected to the actual console.
[25464.12s -> 25468.86s]  Because once these are done, we can move on like Sega Bass.
[25468.86s -> 25469.66s]  Yeah, it's on Steam.
[25469.66s -> 25470.86s]  There's a whole package on Steam.
[25471.58s -> 25476.66s]  I own them all, but I have to kind of do these first.
[25477.46s -> 25481.00s]  So we're kind of going through a little bit of the garbage can first
[25481.64s -> 25484.76s]  and some other classic ones that are not available anywhere else.
[25485.40s -> 25489.90s]  But I still have a lot.
[25489.90s -> 25490.62s]  I had a lot of fun.
[25493.03s -> 25500.12s]  I it's something oddly satisfying and interesting to go through old
[25500.84s -> 25502.52s]  games that you've never really seen or played before.
[25503.40s -> 25504.95s]  It's like a new it's different era.
[25504.95s -> 25505.91s]  It's it's I like it.
[25505.91s -> 25507.51s]  I like just putting the disc in.
[25507.51s -> 25508.71s]  And what do we get?
[25508.71s -> 25512.31s]  It's something it's like a it's like a little Forrest Gump box of chocolates.
[25512.31s -> 25513.27s]  You know, you just never know.
[25514.55s -> 25517.96s]  Sometimes you get like three or four duds in a row.
[25518.78s -> 25520.22s]  Sometimes there's a really good one in there.
[25521.02s -> 25525.74s]  So we're going to go with bits.
[25526.84s -> 25529.08s]  And then when we're done with Dreamcast stuff,
[25529.80s -> 25532.04s]  which would probably be after tomorrow,
[25533.51s -> 25535.83s]  there'll probably be only a couple left.
[25536.47s -> 25537.61s]  Oh, what do you guys think?
[25537.61s -> 25540.41s]  So should I start with like should I start with the rest of the dog shit
[25540.41s -> 25542.73s]  and then move into like the good ones or should I start with Tony Hawk
[25544.76s -> 25545.72s]  and just play Tony Hawk?
[25546.60s -> 25548.55s]  I'm trying to figure that out.
[25554.82s -> 25555.78s]  Now that makes sense.
[25555.78s -> 25560.10s]  Start with dog shit and then go from terrible games to okay.
[25560.10s -> 25562.42s]  And out here is like that was like a couple hours.
[25562.42s -> 25562.98s]  There they go.
[25563.86s -> 25565.94s]  And now we're going to play Tony Hawk for the rest of the night.
[25565.94s -> 25566.58s]  That makes sense.
[25573.48s -> 25575.00s]  You can only go up at that point.
[25576.33s -> 25578.09s]  All right, let's do the bits and the subs.
[25578.09s -> 25579.05s]  Thanks everybody for watching.
[25581.91s -> 25583.51s]  It's always an interesting time.
[25586.28s -> 25587.08s]  If you stick it around.
[25588.20s -> 25588.60s]  Awesome.
[25588.60s -> 25591.88s]  If not, then I will see you hopefully tomorrow.
[25592.76s -> 25593.88s]  Probably around the same time.
[25593.88s -> 25595.40s]  Three ish PM Pacific.
[25600.06s -> 25600.62s]  It's open.
[25606.63s -> 25609.51s]  Oh, Resident Evil 2 Remake is going to start
[25610.31s -> 25611.99s]  once we're done with the Dreamcast stuff,
[25611.99s -> 25613.75s]  at least the physical Dreamcast stuff.
[25614.39s -> 25617.43s]  So after tomorrow, I'm assuming I'll be done with all the physical stuff.
[25618.47s -> 25622.73s]  And then that brings us to what?
[25622.73s -> 25623.53s]  Friday?
[25623.53s -> 25624.73s]  Today's Saturday.
[25625.29s -> 25626.49s]  That'll bring us to Sunday.
[25627.13s -> 25630.17s]  So I'll probably start Resident Evil 2 Remake on Monday.
[25635.82s -> 25637.91s]  But thanks for watching.
[25640.47s -> 25641.99s]  Sometimes you guys just do it to me, man.
[25642.95s -> 25647.19s]  That shit was I don't know why that one comment made me fucking laugh so hard.
[25647.19s -> 25649.51s]  It was like I couldn't even control myself anymore.
[25650.79s -> 25652.79s]  So many things are going through my mind.
[25653.75s -> 25660.78s]  I'm going to be laughing about that in bed tonight.
[25660.78s -> 25662.54s]  I'm just going to be lying there with my iPad,
[25662.54s -> 25663.98s]  just looking at like Reddit or something.
[25663.98s -> 25664.78s]  And I'm just going to happen.
[25668.98s -> 25676.15s]  Anyways, I hope you guys had a good time.
[25676.15s -> 25677.43s]  I hope it was interesting enough.
[25678.15s -> 25679.59s]  If it wasn't, then we'll try again tomorrow.
[25680.31s -> 25696.07s]  So let's go back to earlier tonight.
[25698.31s -> 25700.31s]  We have a dollar from Dr. Steen.
[25700.31s -> 25703.83s]  What are the plans streams for the near future after Dreamcast and Resident Evil?
[25705.70s -> 25707.22s]  Oh, that's a good question.
[25707.22s -> 25709.54s]  I really I leave it kind of up in the air.
[25710.74s -> 25714.18s]  I usually try to plan out a couple weeks of streams.
[25715.30s -> 25717.38s]  So on the when I have like a day off,
[25718.18s -> 25720.82s]  I usually try to sit there and think of, hey, what can we do?
[25720.82s -> 25723.46s]  What's something fun to do this week or next week or something?
[25723.46s -> 25726.34s]  Obviously, a major game release ties into that.
[25727.78s -> 25729.46s]  But there are a lot of requests people have.
[25729.46s -> 25733.18s]  There's a lot of recommendations that they could fit in.
[25733.98s -> 25741.43s]  I was always curious about Blue Stinger and Interested.
[25741.43s -> 25745.03s]  Yeah, but that's you got to remember this.
[25745.03s -> 25747.19s]  It's not like the best representation of the game
[25748.60s -> 25751.00s]  because obviously it's very old
[25751.72s -> 25753.56s]  and there's probably so much more after it.
[25753.56s -> 25757.32s]  And I might maybe I'll try to jump back into it again tomorrow
[25758.20s -> 25763.27s]  because it's it's definitely worth playing.
[25763.27s -> 25768.82s]  I think maybe the music's a little too loud, but it's OK.
[25771.61s -> 25775.69s]  But after that, after Dreamcast, after Resident Evil 2,
[25776.81s -> 25779.62s]  I don't know, there's a couple of small projects
[25779.62s -> 25782.18s]  and larger projects that I want to try to do
[25782.18s -> 25784.02s]  and get done at some point before the spring,
[25785.30s -> 25786.02s]  which should be fun.
[25786.74s -> 25788.74s]  And you'll find out maybe more about those a little bit later.
[25789.46s -> 25791.38s]  There's also the movie Encore Night.
[25792.18s -> 25794.02s]  The green screen Encore Night is what I mean.
[25794.02s -> 25796.34s]  I want us to get that set up too over the next couple weeks.
[25797.46s -> 25801.37s]  But I don't I don't plan out three, four weeks,
[25801.37s -> 25802.49s]  so a month out of streams.
[25802.49s -> 25804.25s]  They kind of just whatever I feel like doing
[25804.25s -> 25805.53s]  is what I usually feel like doing.
[25808.31s -> 25809.91s]  But thank you to Dr. Steen.
[25809.91s -> 25810.23s]  Thank you.
[25810.23s -> 25812.63s]  Trust no one for the one dollar.
[25812.63s -> 25813.43s]  Hello there, Jeremy.
[25813.43s -> 25815.27s]  I can clearly see that you had such a chill
[25815.27s -> 25816.63s]  and pleasant stream today.
[25816.63s -> 25817.75s]  It's so nice and sweet.
[25817.75s -> 25818.71s]  Yes, indeed.
[25818.71s -> 25820.55s]  However, please never forget that life is pain
[25820.55s -> 25821.59s]  and you hate it.
[25821.59s -> 25822.71s]  Let me remind you of that.
[25823.67s -> 25825.29s]  Mind you.
[25825.29s -> 25826.33s]  Actually, let me turn off the Dreamcast.
[25831.83s -> 25833.43s]  There now you can hear me clearly.
[25839.34s -> 25839.74s]  Let's see.
[25840.46s -> 25842.07s]  Let's get reminded.
[25844.90s -> 25850.76s]  What the hell is this?
[25850.76s -> 25858.23s]  This is German 95.
[25858.23s -> 25861.27s]  Only competent Dark Souls streamer of 2019.
[25862.39s -> 25869.22s]  I've seen this year.
[25870.73s -> 25873.69s]  That means a lot considering I've struggled a lot
[25873.69s -> 25875.29s]  with this game when I first played it.
[25875.29s -> 25876.97s]  Wow, that what a confidence boost.
[25878.01s -> 25878.65s]  Thank you for that.
[25878.65s -> 25880.89s]  Seriously, that was a super confidence boost.
[25880.89s -> 25881.77s]  I can do anything now.
[25882.57s -> 25884.25s]  I'm capable of anything.
[25884.25s -> 25886.49s]  Oh, I'm facing the wrong fucking direction.
[25887.29s -> 25889.69s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[25889.69s -> 25890.65s]  Dude, this is hell.
[25891.77s -> 25892.41s]  I can't even.
[25892.41s -> 25895.64s]  Oh, what the fuck happened?
[25895.64s -> 25896.60s]  One hit, what the?
[25898.44s -> 25900.36s]  I'm fucking deleting that weapon.
[25900.36s -> 25902.52s]  The Watchers is not even going to be as hard as this.
[25907.66s -> 25908.16s]  Same.
[25908.78s -> 25911.82s]  Suck my bum.
[25912.38s -> 25913.42s]  Come on.
[25913.42s -> 25914.62s]  Come on first person.
[25916.30s -> 25917.34s]  Holy shit.
[25917.34s -> 25918.14s]  It's so hard.
[25921.05s -> 25921.55s]  Barable.
[25924.07s -> 25925.83s]  Oh, it's so hard.
[25925.83s -> 25926.79s]  It's too much.
[25927.43s -> 25929.51s]  It's too much to handle.
[25933.27s -> 25935.48s]  The distance.
[25936.28s -> 25937.64s]  The distance.
[25937.64s -> 25940.20s]  It's hard to tell what the distance is.
[25941.56s -> 25944.31s]  It's my mind.
[25944.31s -> 25946.55s]  I don't know why I continue to do it.
[25947.27s -> 25949.11s]  I told you I was going to beat it first fucking try.
[25950.87s -> 25968.28s]  That was a great video, first of all.
[25970.12s -> 25970.76s]  Second of all.
[25972.10s -> 25974.98s]  Dirtiest NFL cheap shots.
[25974.98s -> 25975.70s]  I'm not going to watch.
[25975.70s -> 25977.06s]  I don't want to watch that right now.
[25977.06s -> 25981.05s]  No, that was very hard.
[25981.05s -> 25982.17s]  That's one of the hardest things ever.
[25983.90s -> 25984.86s]  The dodging and the fra-
[25984.86s -> 25985.98s]  I don't even need to explain it.
[25993.08s -> 25994.68s]  Too many emotions on that stream.
[25999.02s -> 25999.82s]  But thank you for that.
[25999.82s -> 26000.62s]  That was great.
[26000.62s -> 26001.98s]  That was Trust No One.
[26001.98s -> 26004.38s]  And here's the link to that video if you'd like to watch it.
[26012.90s -> 26013.40s]  Thank you.
[26014.66s -> 26016.10s]  Thank you to FutureGamer for the $1.
[26016.10s -> 26017.94s]  Do you ever get those gluten tests back?
[26017.94s -> 26018.98s]  No, I actually have not.
[26019.06s -> 26021.06s]  I have to go back to the doctor to get them back.
[26022.34s -> 26024.26s]  And I had a series of-
[26024.26s -> 26026.10s]  I had a shitload of things come back.
[26026.98s -> 26029.30s]  But the doctor that I have right now is-
[26029.30s -> 26030.82s]  I can't get them over the phone.
[26032.10s -> 26035.74s]  So I actually have to physically go in for a doctor's appointment
[26035.74s -> 26037.74s]  because they won't tell me the results over the phone.
[26038.62s -> 26039.74s]  So it's like, okay.
[26040.54s -> 26042.46s]  So I got to make a new appointment and go back in.
[26042.46s -> 26044.70s]  And I haven't done that in the last like week and a half or so.
[26045.34s -> 26046.06s]  So I got to go back.
[26047.10s -> 26053.11s]  But everything else was great.
[26053.11s -> 26054.31s]  But everything else was great.
[26054.31s -> 26057.19s]  I had a lot of other tests to make sure that nothing else was going on.
[26057.19s -> 26060.87s]  And all my blood work was okay.
[26060.87s -> 26062.55s]  There was some- I had some high calcium.
[26062.55s -> 26063.99s]  Like, I don't know if you guys remember.
[26064.87s -> 26066.79s]  I brought it up maybe like three or four months ago.
[26067.59s -> 26070.87s]  I had a fairly high blood calcium for no reason.
[26073.78s -> 26078.12s]  And I guess there's like, oh, you make sure you keep an eye on that.
[26079.37s -> 26082.65s]  And I had another couple of tests done.
[26083.21s -> 26084.65s]  And over the last couple of months,
[26084.65s -> 26086.17s]  it hasn't really gone any higher.
[26086.73s -> 26088.41s]  It's receded back a little bit.
[26088.41s -> 26090.57s]  So it's not a problem anymore.
[26091.69s -> 26092.33s]  So that's good.
[26092.89s -> 26094.01s]  But everything else is fine.
[26094.81s -> 26097.13s]  Just going to try to find out if I'm intolerant.
[26097.13s -> 26099.29s]  I did a full food allergy panel.
[26099.29s -> 26100.25s]  So we'll see.
[26101.37s -> 26105.24s]  Kidney health, kidneys are fine.
[26105.24s -> 26105.96s]  Kidneys are fine.
[26105.96s -> 26106.60s]  Liver is fine.
[26107.40s -> 26109.96s]  Everything's pretty much perfectly fine.
[26111.56s -> 26112.52s]  But I appreciate the concern.
[26112.52s -> 26113.48s]  Thank you, future gamer.
[26114.78s -> 26117.10s]  And all of you, everyone obviously with the love in the chat.
[26117.74s -> 26118.30s]  Thank you.
[26118.30s -> 26118.86s]  Appreciate it.
[26120.31s -> 26120.87s]  Hack it fast.
[26120.87s -> 26121.67s]  Thanks for the $1.
[26121.67s -> 26123.19s]  Jet set or choo-choo rocket.
[26123.19s -> 26124.79s]  Also, I eat ass.
[26124.79s -> 26125.75s]  Now that's on you.
[26125.75s -> 26128.23s]  That's for you to do and decide if that's what you're going to do.
[26128.79s -> 26129.51s]  Hey, pigeon.
[26129.51s -> 26130.47s]  Thanks for the $1.
[26132.55s -> 26134.79s]  They say, if you decide against it, it's none of my business.
[26134.79s -> 26135.83s]  And I'm okay with that.
[26135.83s -> 26136.71s]  Thanks for the great content.
[26136.71s -> 26137.11s]  Keep it up.
[26137.99s -> 26139.19s]  Changed my name recently.
[26139.83s -> 26143.30s]  What is this?
[26146.17s -> 26148.09s]  The Sega Dreamcast microphone.
[26148.09s -> 26148.59s]  Yeah.
[26153.14s -> 26155.30s]  That's the worst part about the things I bought.
[26156.02s -> 26162.20s]  So I bought Seaman and it was very expensive.
[26162.20s -> 26165.72s]  It was an embarrassing amount of money to pay for something.
[26166.28s -> 26170.33s]  And when it did not come with the microphone, I was like,
[26171.05s -> 26173.61s]  number one, somebody might be trying to scam me.
[26175.80s -> 26178.20s]  Or number two, they just forgot.
[26178.84s -> 26183.16s]  But I did a refund through Amazon and it apparently works.
[26183.16s -> 26184.12s]  So I just have to set it back.
[26185.00s -> 26193.83s]  But the fate of Seaman, you will see it.
[26194.55s -> 26196.39s]  Just not within the next couple of days.
[26196.39s -> 26197.67s]  I'm just going to load it up one day.
[26198.55s -> 26200.39s]  And just play it for like an hour and just fuck around.
[26204.81s -> 26206.73s]  But pigeon, thank you for the $2 here.
[26210.30s -> 26214.55s]  It's similar more links to the microphone stuff.
[26215.53s -> 26217.85s]  Which I will definitely be trying to get one.
[26219.22s -> 26222.50s]  Whether that's through another Amazon order or through another means.
[26222.50s -> 26223.78s]  So definitely.
[26223.78s -> 26224.18s]  Thank you.
[26225.14s -> 26226.58s]  Dorkcube, thanks for the $1.
[26226.58s -> 26229.70s]  What a plot twist that you would end up interacting with Joel more than Vinny.
[26232.42s -> 26235.22s]  I interact with Vinny.
[26238.78s -> 26242.14s]  They're both fucking cool.
[26242.14s -> 26242.78s]  What are you talking about?
[26251.50s -> 26252.30s]  Why do you...
[26252.30s -> 26253.50s]  What do you mean neglect?
[26259.08s -> 26260.20s]  I don't have any...
[26263.69s -> 26264.81s]  It's organic.
[26266.10s -> 26266.66s]  Organic.
[26268.22s -> 26269.66s]  Something that if you hang out with somebody,
[26269.66s -> 26270.54s]  you don't hang out with somebody.
[26270.54s -> 26272.46s]  Like versus Kraken was in Vegas.
[26273.34s -> 26276.26s]  You know, when was the last time somebody like streamed with Kraken?
[26278.41s -> 26278.97s]  You hit me up.
[26278.97s -> 26279.85s]  Hey, I'm in Vegas.
[26280.41s -> 26281.53s]  Yeah, I'll let come say hello.
[26281.53s -> 26282.49s]  Yeah, that organic.
[26285.34s -> 26286.46s]  We did and it was great.
[26287.10s -> 26296.01s]  Thank you, Dorkcube.
[26296.97s -> 26298.65s]  Thank you, Gib for the $5.
[26298.65s -> 26302.09s]  Maggie Simpson, binky sound when you swim.
[26307.10s -> 26310.06s]  Thank you, the cows are watching me for the $10.
[26310.06s -> 26312.70s]  Hey, German, just want to tell you thanks for all the great laughs through the years.
[26312.70s -> 26314.14s]  Hope you have an awesome 2019.
[26314.14s -> 26315.98s]  By the way, love the Kenshi streams.
[26315.98s -> 26316.48s]  Thanks.
[26320.51s -> 26325.55s]  Thank you for supporting any of the content that I put out here.
[26325.55s -> 26327.63s]  Any of the video games that I play, any of the stuff that I do.
[26328.19s -> 26328.99s]  Thank you, it means a lot.
[26329.71s -> 26333.05s]  And I just hope that you're having fun.
[26333.77s -> 26339.37s]  One of the reasons why I purchase stuff like Dreamcast
[26339.37s -> 26340.57s]  and buy a bunch of random games
[26340.57s -> 26342.89s]  and just see what looks like could be fun or interesting
[26344.27s -> 26345.55s]  is because that's why I want to do it.
[26345.55s -> 26347.95s]  I want it to be an interesting experience for all of us.
[26348.75s -> 26350.19s]  And it is, I think, a lot sometimes.
[26350.83s -> 26352.27s]  I know that was just an oxymoron, but
[26358.81s -> 26360.89s]  arm level two is going to be in the next year of a rumble
[26360.89s -> 26364.97s]  and it's going to be a tiny small person with just one jacked arm.
[26365.69s -> 26370.76s]  And that's kind of has to happen.
[26371.32s -> 26378.43s]  But thank you so much for the $10.
[26379.52s -> 26381.60s]  Hey, LMM, thanks for the $3.
[26383.50s -> 26384.54s]  No message, but thank you.
[26384.54s -> 26387.82s]  Also, I want to say this one more time.
[26387.82s -> 26390.78s]  Well, I'm going to kind of transition it over the next couple of weeks.
[26392.06s -> 26394.54s]  I'm changing the minimum bits for readings.
[26395.34s -> 26397.90s]  But I didn't really want to just throw that and be like,
[26397.90s -> 26399.58s]  Darn it! Okay, it's $3 now.
[26400.54s -> 26402.22s]  So over the next couple of weeks.
[26403.18s -> 26404.62s]  And then I'm going to kind of give like a cutoff.
[26406.33s -> 26407.69s]  We talked about it a couple of days ago.
[26409.18s -> 26411.98s]  Just about streamlining things.
[26411.98s -> 26414.88s]  And it was a very long conversation about money.
[26419.36s -> 26421.92s]  So it is turning into three.
[26421.92s -> 26425.68s]  300 bits will be the minimum for reading at the end of a stream.
[26429.31s -> 26432.35s]  And I don't think it is not $3 now.
[26433.31s -> 26436.83s]  I'm going to just, I just want to make people aware that in a few weeks,
[26438.25s -> 26441.53s]  somewhere probably in February, that I'm going to keep talking about it.
[26441.53s -> 26442.65s]  I'm going to make sure people are aware.
[26442.65s -> 26446.25s]  Because I think last time, a lot of people weren't aware of it.
[26448.35s -> 26451.79s]  And I kind of just made it $1 like a year and a half ago.
[26452.51s -> 26456.75s]  And then people were still spending, you know, 25 cents or 50 cents.
[26456.75s -> 26459.95s]  And they were writing these very nice thought out messages.
[26459.95s -> 26461.95s]  And I just wasn't, I don't think they even knew.
[26462.59s -> 26465.47s]  So I'm not just going to do it immediately like I did kind of last time.
[26471.60s -> 26474.96s]  But I have to do another explanation for it.
[26476.06s -> 26479.34s]  We just, we've seen such extreme growth on this channel.
[26480.22s -> 26483.42s]  With viewership and money and support.
[26483.42s -> 26491.58s]  And it's kind of, it's kind of a necessary evil at this point.
[26493.34s -> 26495.66s]  You know, even just in viewership alone,
[26495.66s -> 26500.62s]  it's gone up about nearly 35% or so in just people that are just here.
[26501.82s -> 26508.17s]  Hope you guys understand it's I'm not trying to just bleed money out of people.
[26508.97s -> 26516.19s]  I'm just trying to have, I'm just trying to like run the best stream that I can.
[26518.16s -> 26518.96s]  I hope you understand.
[26528.49s -> 26531.63s]  And we'll maybe, we'll see.
[26531.63s -> 26532.51s]  We'll see how it goes.
[26534.54s -> 26539.74s]  Another year or two, I mean, I had the last minimum for about a year and a half, right?
[26539.74s -> 26542.22s]  Maybe a little bit more, like just over a year, maybe.
[26543.18s -> 26550.00s]  I don't really see there's an opportunity why it would be increased again anytime soon at all.
[26551.20s -> 26552.16s]  And maybe never again.
[26552.72s -> 26563.64s]  But that will be happening in the next few weeks.
[26563.64s -> 26565.15s]  Just want to make people aware of it.
[26565.79s -> 26568.65s]  But thank you LMM for the three bucks.
[26568.65s -> 26570.25s]  Thank you Dork Cube for the one dollar.
[26570.25s -> 26571.77s]  Those poor developers.
[26571.77s -> 26575.05s]  They put all their time and effort into creating a new IP only for it to die on
[26575.05s -> 26576.01s]  the operating table.
[26576.57s -> 26580.70s]  But you, Jerma, you can continue on their legacy.
[26580.70s -> 26581.18s]  That's right.
[26581.18s -> 26583.42s]  Floydgan Brothers for Jerma Rummel.
[26591.88s -> 26599.58s]  We, you know, there was some talk that we've got potentially like a C minus stream here.
[26600.46s -> 26603.82s]  But interestingly enough, even in like a C minus stream,
[26605.52s -> 26609.36s]  there are probably five new characters that I can put into a wrestling event.
[26612.28s -> 26613.48s]  That's pretty great.
[26614.12s -> 26623.66s]  Floydgan Brothers tag team match that messed up Alien that I made.
[26625.23s -> 26626.03s]  Level two arm.
[26626.67s -> 26627.23s]  They're a lot.
[26627.95s -> 26634.20s]  But they're all C minus characters.
[26638.60s -> 26639.80s]  But I kid.
[26639.80s -> 26644.36s]  Kidding.
[26644.36s -> 26646.44s]  I missed the stream so it gets an F.
[26648.96s -> 26649.84s]  No, I had fun.
[26653.26s -> 26656.30s]  There was one or two places where I didn't.
[26657.72s -> 26658.92s]  But not really.
[26659.72s -> 26663.64s]  Out of a seven plus hour stream, I think I had fun for about six hours and 42 minutes.
[26673.96s -> 26676.68s]  I wish I had like an exact screenshot of when that happened.
[26677.32s -> 26680.88s]  I think I remember who it was.
[26680.88s -> 26681.44s]  Exactly.
[26681.44s -> 26682.80s]  It was, it was, it was Penny.
[26683.44s -> 26684.48s]  It was Penny Kettle.
[26688.72s -> 26690.16s]  It was just perfect.
[26691.66s -> 26693.02s]  It came at a perfect time.
[26696.89s -> 26699.45s]  Yeah, that came at a perfect time.
[26700.56s -> 26702.00s]  It was unbelievably timed.
[26702.72s -> 26705.58s]  Like that's a bravo.
[26710.40s -> 26711.28s]  But thank you, Dorku.
[26711.28s -> 26712.56s]  Thank you, Smelly Boy, for the one dollar.
[26712.56s -> 26714.32s]  The Floydgan Brothers better be in the next rumble.
[26714.32s -> 26714.80s]  They will be.
[26716.24s -> 26717.60s]  Hyena Dip, thanks for the one dollar.
[26717.60s -> 26719.52s]  This is just of Mice and Men, the game.
[26722.22s -> 26723.82s]  Casey, thanks for the one dollar.
[26723.82s -> 26728.30s]  The voices of the Floydgan Brothers are the voices of Scooby and Max from a goofy movie.
[26729.26s -> 26731.74s]  This game even actually had legitimate DLC.
[26732.54s -> 26739.12s]  Yeah, I can't, I, even when we were playing it.
[26739.12s -> 26740.08s]  Sure, it's a little slow.
[26740.72s -> 26744.64s]  Maybe a little too potentially boring for a stream, maybe.
[26744.64s -> 26749.20s]  But as a video game for a kind of young audience,
[26749.20s -> 26751.20s]  that was probably great back when it came out.
[26751.20s -> 26752.88s]  It just, it was, had to have been.
[26756.16s -> 26757.76s]  Thank you, Marvish McGally, for the one dollar.
[26757.76s -> 26760.88s]  Watching you beat Dynamite Cop with just four credits was very much worth it.
[26761.60s -> 26763.39s]  It's a great game.
[26766.86s -> 26768.86s]  Thank you, Freudian Weapon, for the two dollars.
[26768.86s -> 26773.50s]  Definitely going to track down a copy of Dynamite Cop for my Dreamcast gamebook's bonkers.
[26775.28s -> 26777.12s]  Yeah, it is more than one player.
[26777.12s -> 26778.80s]  It is, I believe, two players at least.
[26787.50s -> 26789.66s]  Oh, did Penny got gifted a sub?
[26790.38s -> 26793.56s]  Well, thank you for whoever did that.
[26799.55s -> 26800.19s]  I missed it.
[26800.19s -> 26801.31s]  What did Penny Kettle do?
[26803.08s -> 26804.28s]  Nothing, nothing bad.
[26804.28s -> 26806.76s]  It was just, it was very, very funny to me.
[26807.40s -> 26816.43s]  I was running up and down a slope in a game, and I can't even explain it.
[26816.43s -> 26817.47s]  It just was perfect.
[26819.07s -> 26819.47s]  I can't.
[26822.75s -> 26823.95s]  Wildfox, thanks for the one dollar.
[26823.95s -> 26826.11s]  Hey, Jerma, something you said recently maybe remembers a saying
[26826.11s -> 26827.55s]  that I came up with some years ago.
[26828.75s -> 26830.67s]  Political differences destroy friendships,
[26830.67s -> 26833.31s]  but complete political indifference destroys lives.
[26833.95s -> 26837.07s]  Refusing to talk about politics is a good decision, especially on stream.
[26837.71s -> 26840.75s]  On a side note, sorry if I haven't brought up depression a few times
[26841.39s -> 26843.07s]  with the few donations I made,
[26843.07s -> 26845.87s]  but it's very relieving to vent about it in a way.
[26848.33s -> 26849.53s]  No, that's okay.
[26849.53s -> 26850.25s]  Don't worry about that.
[26852.99s -> 26857.68s]  But yeah, politics and we touched upon it.
[26857.68s -> 26860.83s]  We talked about it already a few nights ago,
[26862.83s -> 26866.27s]  but I don't want to turn this stream into a debate
[26867.23s -> 26868.99s]  because that's not what it is intended for.
[26870.94s -> 26873.74s]  My intention to broadcast and hang out here
[26873.74s -> 26876.22s]  and do stuff and hang out with you guys
[26876.30s -> 26880.86s]  in like this live kind of broadcasted community thing
[26881.66s -> 26883.50s]  is not to start debates.
[26884.30s -> 26885.42s]  That's not why I'm here.
[26886.06s -> 26893.61s]  We're here just to hang out and have a good time.
[26893.61s -> 26895.31s]  That's it.
[26895.85s -> 26905.23s]  But I really appreciate it.
[26905.23s -> 26907.15s]  Thank you so much for the one dollar, Wildfox.
[26908.94s -> 26910.30s]  Lazy Luke, thanks for the one dollar.
[26912.24s -> 26919.13s]  We got a top 1,000 streamer piece of work here.
[26919.69s -> 26923.29s]  Did I go up any higher?
[26923.29s -> 26926.38s]  I was top 800 a few weeks ago.
[26926.38s -> 26928.54s]  Did I fall back down to earth?
[26928.54s -> 26929.50s]  What happened?
[26929.50s -> 26931.10s]  Am I back down to the top 1,000?
[26943.02s -> 26945.90s]  Then you played the Dreamcast and went back down.
[26955.37s -> 26958.01s]  It's a great system with some genre defining moments.
[26958.01s -> 26961.40s]  Coca-Cola classic.
[26963.36s -> 26965.36s]  But thank you to Jules for the one dollar.
[26965.36s -> 26966.48s]  I never heard of Dynamite Cop,
[26966.48s -> 26968.96s]  but Die Hard Arcade was also my favorite arcade game.
[26969.76s -> 26972.72s]  It's the only arcade game I ever beat in an actual arcade.
[26972.72s -> 26973.84s]  When I was like 12,
[26974.48s -> 26977.76s]  my brother and I spent hours in one sitting
[26977.84s -> 26978.56s]  playing this game.
[26979.28s -> 26981.36s]  I don't know how many quarters we spent playing this,
[26981.36s -> 26982.32s]  but it was so much fun.
[26982.96s -> 26983.84s]  After we beat the game,
[26983.84s -> 26987.04s]  I was surprised to see a crowd of about 30 spectators behind us.
[26987.60s -> 26989.92s]  Glad to hear that this was one of your favorite arcade games, too.
[26992.16s -> 26993.92s]  It is so fun.
[26993.92s -> 26998.22s]  And we're getting coxed here.
[26998.86s -> 26999.42s]  Just a little.
[27000.38s -> 27012.11s]  Jerma is a great streamer with some genre defining moments.
[27012.11s -> 27014.03s]  He sucks though, laughing my ass off.
[27015.56s -> 27018.12s]  It's the laughing my ass off part that I think did it to me.
[27019.95s -> 27021.31s]  But that's awesome, Jules.
[27021.31s -> 27022.51s]  Thank you for the one dollar.
[27023.15s -> 27024.59s]  Thank you, Snoozing Copter, for the one dollar.
[27024.59s -> 27026.59s]  All right, Jerma, how can you enjoy Dynamite Cop this much
[27026.59s -> 27028.75s]  and not even play 20 minutes of God Hand?
[27028.75s -> 27030.11s]  Don't answer, I know.
[27030.11s -> 27032.35s]  It takes time to get used to the controls in God Hand
[27032.35s -> 27033.71s]  and at least one or two hours.
[27034.35s -> 27035.07s]  Please play it again.
[27035.07s -> 27035.55s]  You'll love it.
[27041.63s -> 27043.95s]  Yeah, I did kind of just give up on God Hand, didn't I?
[27044.75s -> 27045.39s]  I don't know why.
[27052.86s -> 27055.02s]  Everybody threw their hats in the air and cheered.
[27057.20s -> 27067.45s]  But I think one of the things with these compilation,
[27067.45s -> 27071.58s]  retro kind of streams is because there are so many,
[27074.48s -> 27080.04s]  it's hard to put more than an hour or two into one of these.
[27081.28s -> 27083.84s]  And some of them obviously don't, I mean, there's a lot of them.
[27083.84s -> 27088.64s]  Most of them don't really necessarily even deserve an hour or two.
[27090.06s -> 27092.22s]  But the ones that do, in the back of my mind,
[27092.22s -> 27096.36s]  I'm always thinking, oh, I've been here for like two and a half hours,
[27096.36s -> 27099.00s]  but I got to stack this high next to me of other games to play.
[27099.00s -> 27107.63s]  But stuff like God Hand that requires that time,
[27110.49s -> 27112.09s]  especially during like a compilation night,
[27112.81s -> 27115.77s]  maybe it wouldn't be a bad, I mean, I still get the thing over there.
[27115.77s -> 27119.53s]  I just did, there's still like six, at least seven,
[27119.53s -> 27122.33s]  maybe eight PlayStation 2 games that are still over there.
[27129.07s -> 27134.84s]  All in due time, all things will happen, hopefully.
[27134.84s -> 27137.16s]  So many games and so little time during the day.
[27138.24s -> 27139.92s]  Yeah, I was thinking about going a little longer tonight,
[27139.92s -> 27141.68s]  but I really need to eat something.
[27142.48s -> 27146.56s]  I got to go take like a proper break and eat.
[27154.43s -> 27155.39s]  We are, let's see.
[27156.11s -> 27158.41s]  But thank you, Sneezing Copter.
[27158.41s -> 27160.89s]  Thank you, thank you Jess for the $1.
[27160.89s -> 27163.85s]  You remember Jamsters, what is a Jamster?
[27185.61s -> 27187.61s]  Holy shit, yeah, I remember this.
[27189.77s -> 27194.12s]  I forgot about that.
[27195.56s -> 27196.68s]  The original scam.
[27198.41s -> 27200.09s]  The original phone scam.
[27211.55s -> 27213.71s]  I buried that and you brought it back.
[27213.71s -> 27216.43s]  I forgot all about those commercials, but thank you.
[27217.07s -> 27218.59s]  Yeah, Crazy Frog was one of them.
[27219.39s -> 27225.50s]  Remember he was in the go-kart in some city at night?
[27226.30s -> 27229.07s]  It was a weird like Batmobile thing.
[27229.07s -> 27233.26s]  That's fucked up.
[27233.26s -> 27234.70s]  Thank you Carrot7 for the $1.
[27234.70s -> 27236.86s]  Two games in, I have determined that Dreamcast games
[27236.86s -> 27239.02s]  are the most chaotic neutral items in existence.
[27240.89s -> 27241.37s]  Kind of, yeah.
[27243.28s -> 27244.64s]  Thank you Alec for the $1.
[27244.64s -> 27246.16s]  You should play Bounty Hunter for the PS2.
[27250.60s -> 27252.84s]  Bounty Hunter, Star Wars, think you're talking about.
[27254.65s -> 27256.17s]  I do remember it being a very fun game.
[27256.81s -> 27259.60s]  Thank you, it's time for Slime for the $1 and it's a link.
[27260.40s -> 27263.82s]  Why would you give this to me right now?
[27264.62s -> 27265.76s]  I didn't even find that.
[27266.76s -> 27268.04s]  So the best part about this.
[27268.68s -> 27271.80s]  The name, this was uploaded in 2014.
[27271.80s -> 27273.72s]  This is called the Ring Terror's Realm.
[27273.72s -> 27274.20s]  You ready?
[27276.08s -> 27276.80s]  Are we still live?
[27281.20s -> 27284.56s]  This YouTube video is called the Ring Terror's Realm.
[27286.25s -> 27289.37s]  Most annoying music looped and extended.
[27290.01s -> 27297.21s]  So you guys weren't, it wasn't just you guys.
[27298.65s -> 27306.09s]  That's enough of that.
[27311.48s -> 27315.24s]  Getting some, I don't know what's going on with the internet recently.
[27315.24s -> 27318.36s]  We had a good solid probably five straight hours of no,
[27318.36s -> 27320.28s]  well I think, did we actually turn off?
[27323.04s -> 27323.84s]  I don't know.
[27323.84s -> 27328.30s]  We're getting kind of killed right now.
[27334.65s -> 27335.37s]  We're still live.
[27336.76s -> 27338.68s]  We're not going to zero, which is a good thing, but
[27340.51s -> 27345.16s]  the first hour or so of the stream was very chunky.
[27345.80s -> 27349.64s]  It looks like the last 40 minutes or so here have been also pretty chunky.
[27349.64s -> 27352.28s]  The middle about six, five or six hours was fine.
[27353.32s -> 27354.52s]  I'm going to make a call.
[27355.32s -> 27357.53s]  I'm going to have to make another phone call.
[27358.25s -> 27362.41s]  But we're good.
[27362.41s -> 27362.73s]  Thank you.
[27362.73s -> 27364.57s]  It's time for Slime for the annoying music.
[27365.29s -> 27367.39s]  Thank you Divus for the $2.
[27367.39s -> 27367.87s]  Appreciate it.
[27368.51s -> 27370.43s]  Someguy9 thanks for $5.
[27370.43s -> 27373.07s]  Since people seem to like my ARF video from last stream,
[27373.07s -> 27375.47s]  I'm back with another shitty meme video.
[27375.47s -> 27389.95s]  What the hell was that?
[27403.29s -> 27406.27s]  What was, what's a classic?
[27406.75s -> 27408.35s]  I don't any of these like meme videos.
[27409.47s -> 27411.23s]  Thank you Someguy9 for the $5.
[27412.59s -> 27414.19s]  Thank you Carrot for the $1.
[27414.19s -> 27417.72s]  I can't tell if I'm watching the ring or the room.
[27417.72s -> 27419.64s]  This game is a beautiful disaster.
[27420.52s -> 27422.52s]  Yeah, I just wish the game wasn't awful.
[27423.48s -> 27426.52s]  If we got to power through that and see more of those cutscenes,
[27426.52s -> 27427.56s]  the game just sucked.
[27429.05s -> 27432.81s]  It was just sloppy, bad Resident Evil in between some great cutscenes
[27433.45s -> 27434.89s]  and the whole cast of Family Guy.
[27435.69s -> 27445.68s]  It's just too bad that the game was unbearable.
[27451.39s -> 27452.91s]  Thank you Sawdust Bunnies for the $1.
[27452.91s -> 27454.27s]  Dreamcast was my first console,
[27454.27s -> 27456.99s]  so it's nice and nostalgic to see you play these great games.
[27457.79s -> 27459.45s]  There are some great ones.
[27461.42s -> 27463.02s]  Thank you Superman for the $1.
[27463.02s -> 27464.94s]  Hey German, notice you're wearing a UNH t-shirt.
[27465.50s -> 27467.58s]  I just wanted to know if you've ever visited New Hampshire
[27467.58s -> 27470.94s]  because I grew up there and had some of the best experiences of my life there.
[27470.94s -> 27472.06s]  Since I moved to California,
[27472.06s -> 27474.38s]  I've hated it and miss seeing the snow every winter.
[27475.84s -> 27476.96s]  Uh, that's not my shirt.
[27478.64s -> 27480.56s]  But yeah, I've been to New Hampshire plenty of times.
[27484.35s -> 27486.19s]  New Hampshire is a great state.
[27486.19s -> 27487.79s]  There's a lot of awesome, especially the mountains.
[27490.12s -> 27494.84s]  My family and I sometimes will go up and rent a house
[27495.88s -> 27497.24s]  and stay there for a little while.
[27497.80s -> 27501.80s]  Not so much anymore because I'm obviously across the country.
[27502.76s -> 27504.12s]  It was very easy just to be like,
[27504.12s -> 27505.96s]  all right, that's what we're going to do next weekend.
[27505.96s -> 27507.96s]  We're going to go for two days.
[27508.76s -> 27513.44s]  It's not even like a, it's barely like a two hour drive to get to New Hampshire.
[27514.24s -> 27518.65s]  Speaking of snow, yeah, didn't, um,
[27519.66s -> 27523.50s]  it didn't New England get kind of just crushed with a bad storm recently.
[27524.46s -> 27528.88s]  So what was up with the naked thing at the start of the stream?
[27528.88s -> 27530.08s]  Was that just a weird joke?
[27531.79s -> 27534.25s]  Um, a weird joke.
[27534.89s -> 27539.61s]  The camera captures a one frame and it keeps it there in the naked thing.
[27540.41s -> 27548.89s]  New England's about to get crushed by the Rams.
[27549.61s -> 27550.41s]  I don't think so.
[27550.41s -> 27551.05s]  I don't think so.
[27551.05s -> 27551.61s]  I don't think so.
[27552.41s -> 27555.13s]  Is the audio getting weird for people?
[27556.60s -> 27557.80s]  I keep seeing people say that.
[27560.81s -> 27562.09s]  I thought it was like a funny thing to do.
[27562.65s -> 27565.29s]  It's just to have no shirt on and like be unshowered.
[27567.82s -> 27570.46s]  Like I've got, my hair was just all messy and like greasy
[27570.46s -> 27571.58s]  and I like didn't have any clothes.
[27571.58s -> 27572.70s]  I thought it'd be like a funny joke.
[27583.58s -> 27584.78s]  Music is just cursed.
[27590.46s -> 27592.30s]  But yeah, I love New Hampshire.
[27592.30s -> 27593.02s]  It's a great state.
[27593.66s -> 27595.82s]  Thank you Casey for the $5.
[27595.82s -> 27597.02s]  Thank you for playing my favorite console.
[27597.02s -> 27597.98s]  There are still people that,
[27597.98s -> 27600.46s]  there are still people playing Dreamcast online if you can believe it.
[27601.64s -> 27608.22s]  Really, really hyped for the Tony Hawk stream tomorrow.
[27608.22s -> 27609.02s]  I grew up on that game.
[27609.02s -> 27609.66s]  It's one of my favorites.
[27609.66s -> 27612.30s]  Tony Hawk 2 is also the best one in the whole franchise.
[27613.66s -> 27615.80s]  It just is.
[27619.45s -> 27621.29s]  I am looking forward to it.
[27621.29s -> 27623.85s]  I am going to play the shit out of that game tomorrow.
[27623.85s -> 27629.13s]  But thank you Casey.
[27629.69s -> 27632.49s]  I do very much enjoy the Dreamcast as well.
[27632.49s -> 27634.81s]  Very, very interesting system.
[27634.81s -> 27636.89s]  Especially because it's Sega's last system.
[27638.17s -> 27641.29s]  So it's an interesting piece of hardware.
[27641.29s -> 27646.09s]  Hey smelly boy, thanks for the $1.
[27646.09s -> 27648.09s]  You better be ready for that one bare shoulder frame
[27648.09s -> 27650.73s]  to be in every piece of fan-made content for the next two years.
[27651.29s -> 27651.85s]  That's okay.
[27652.41s -> 27654.09s]  It was a funny fucking joke that I did.
[27655.29s -> 27655.85s]  It was a joke.
[27656.41s -> 27657.05s]  You think I was like,
[27657.05s -> 27658.25s]  you think I actually would do that
[27658.25s -> 27660.49s]  and make all the references about how I don't have clothes on ever?
[27661.37s -> 27663.16s]  Come on.
[27663.16s -> 27672.20s]  Like, Kappa.
[27673.07s -> 27674.59s]  Thank you Hasnain for the $1.
[27674.59s -> 27676.83s]  I lost $100 because you didn't die on Wednesday.
[27676.83s -> 27677.39s]  Thanks a lot.
[27678.19s -> 27679.55s]  Why would you ever take that bet?
[27684.06s -> 27685.58s]  That's a very bad bet to make.
[27687.44s -> 27688.96s]  Hey Trotter, thanks for the $1.
[27689.12s -> 27692.40s]  Jerma, what are you doing with the camera on when you were naked?
[27693.98s -> 27695.02s]  Setting up the stream.
[27697.15s -> 27700.03s]  That photo was taken at probably,
[27700.03s -> 27707.55s]  that frame was captured at probably like 2.45, 2.50 Pacific.
[27708.67s -> 27710.91s]  And I came back after showering and getting ready
[27710.91s -> 27711.79s]  and setting the stream up.
[27712.67s -> 27715.07s]  And it was setting up the live stream.
[27715.71s -> 27723.10s]  You had the door open so you just walk around naked.
[27723.10s -> 27724.14s]  I wasn't naked.
[27726.94s -> 27728.38s]  I was not naked.
[27728.38s -> 27732.94s]  I thought just walk around with just nudity.
[27732.94s -> 27734.14s]  I don't, that's not what happens.
[27737.88s -> 27739.40s]  Thank you Smelly Boy for the $1.
[27739.40s -> 27740.92s]  I saw your nude shoulder.
[27740.92s -> 27742.04s]  I'm sure you did, you did.
[27743.48s -> 27746.68s]  Thank you C4G for the $4.20 weed joke.
[27747.32s -> 27748.36s]  Will Jerma read this?
[27748.36s -> 27748.92s]  I just did.
[27749.80s -> 27752.17s]  Thank you for the $4.20 C4G.
[27753.72s -> 27756.68s]  Thank you Sam K42 for the $1.
[27756.68s -> 27757.80s]  A little tip for the stream.
[27757.80s -> 27759.00s]  Love you, Jerma.
[27759.64s -> 27761.36s]  Thank you.
[27761.36s -> 27763.12s]  And then Timmy Tim Tam, thanks for the $1.
[27763.12s -> 27764.16s]  Wow, I'm really tired.
[27764.80s -> 27769.21s]  Always a pleasure to hear these.
[27769.21s -> 27771.34s]  Housework.
[27771.34s -> 27774.38s]  I'm really tired and now I have to go home and cook.
[27774.38s -> 27775.90s]  Do you make dinner every night?
[27775.90s -> 27779.50s]  Yes, I usually make dinner and my husband washes the dishes.
[27779.50s -> 27781.26s]  I live alone so I do everything.
[27781.26s -> 27782.62s]  Sometimes I eat out though.
[27782.62s -> 27784.46s]  There are some good restaurants in my neighborhood.
[27784.46s -> 27785.50s]  Where do you live?
[27785.50s -> 27786.46s]  Near the Penn Center.
[27786.46s -> 27787.34s]  Oh, that's good.
[27787.34s -> 27789.50s]  There aren't any good restaurants near my house.
[27789.50s -> 27791.34s]  Does your husband help you do housework much?
[27791.82s -> 27793.18s]  Um, yes.
[27793.18s -> 27796.70s]  He sets the table almost every night and he makes our bed every morning.
[27796.70s -> 27798.30s]  But I usually make all the meals.
[27798.30s -> 27799.42s]  How about cleaning?
[27799.42s -> 27801.58s]  We clean the house together every weekend.
[27801.58s -> 27804.78s]  I vacuum the rooms and he usually sweeps the floor of the kitchen.
[27804.78s -> 27806.06s]  And he does yard work.
[27806.06s -> 27807.58s]  Your husband helps you so much.
[27808.54s -> 27810.38s]  Both these ladies are on coke.
[27812.25s -> 27813.53s]  Or like crack.
[27814.33s -> 27817.71s]  This is like this dude that there are drugs involved here.
[27818.59s -> 27819.31s]  They have, there are.
[27819.31s -> 27821.07s]  Does he help do the laundry too?
[27821.07s -> 27823.31s]  Well, he's never helped me do the laundry.
[27824.27s -> 27832.65s]  He's talking like so fast and with such a strange rhythm.
[27837.05s -> 27838.67s]  Small talk.
[27839.55s -> 27840.51s]  Oh yeah.
[27840.51s -> 27840.91s]  Okay.
[27841.47s -> 27843.24s]  Well thank you for that.
[27843.24s -> 27847.40s]  And we had a few more come in as we were going over the other ones there.
[27847.40s -> 27848.68s]  Thank you RTM for the one dollar.
[27848.68s -> 27850.84s]  Hey Jerma, I was listening to the stream while playing Remake 2.
[27850.84s -> 27851.40s]  Just one review.
[27851.40s -> 27853.40s]  We're going to take a look at it on stream.
[27853.40s -> 27854.84s]  If not, definitely check it out on your own time.
[27854.84s -> 27856.12s]  It's an absolutely gorgeous game.
[27856.68s -> 27863.44s]  I'm going to be playing Resident Evil 2 on stream in a few days.
[27864.00s -> 27865.92s]  That's going to be the start of the next week.
[27866.48s -> 27868.72s]  I'm going to try to just complete it.
[27868.72s -> 27869.84s]  Because it's, how long is the game?
[27870.64s -> 27883.93s]  Well Kim, you don't do any of those things.
[27883.93s -> 27885.53s]  And then the laughing my ass off face.
[27886.33s -> 27894.54s]  Any of what things?
[27907.71s -> 27909.07s]  Well hold on, hold on, hold on a second.
[27909.07s -> 27910.35s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[27910.35s -> 27912.03s]  Let's just go over a couple things here.
[27914.25s -> 27916.40s]  It's pulling weeds.
[27918.76s -> 27919.80s]  What about the pulling the weeds?
[27920.44s -> 27922.20s]  That's housework.
[27922.20s -> 27924.38s]  What about scrubbing the steps?
[27925.18s -> 27927.20s]  Is that not housework?
[27927.20s -> 27929.31s]  Took about an hour or two for me to do that.
[27929.31s -> 27930.11s]  Pulling weeds, huh?
[27941.36s -> 27942.48s]  That's yard work.
[27942.48s -> 27945.44s]  Well I do the yard work and Kim does the housework.
[27946.00s -> 27947.44s]  And then I do the dishes.
[27947.44s -> 27949.60s]  And then sometimes she sets the table.
[27949.60s -> 27951.12s]  I can relate to this.
[27951.12s -> 27951.60s]  Come on.
[27954.89s -> 27955.93s]  That's not the right video.
[27955.93s -> 27957.69s]  That's a different YouTube link.
[27957.69s -> 27964.54s]  Two hours to clean.
[27964.54s -> 27965.50s]  You don't have any idea.
[27969.55s -> 27971.71s]  You know how many times I've vacuumed?
[27976.46s -> 27981.69s]  My hands are raw with the amount of just yard work that I've done.
[27983.21s -> 27984.41s]  Breaking up rocks.
[27985.36s -> 27986.24s]  Pulling out shit.
[27988.49s -> 27989.45s]  Testing, you know.
[27989.45s -> 27990.65s]  Tapping, tapping, tapping.
[27990.65s -> 27991.29s]  Licking fingers.
[27991.29s -> 27992.09s]  Like is that good?
[27992.09s -> 27992.57s]  Is that clean?
[27993.21s -> 28000.92s]  Oh she's just having fun.
[28000.92s -> 28001.42s]  Okay.
[28008.80s -> 28009.68s]  It's in the oven?
[28010.24s -> 28011.66s]  Food is in the oven.
[28011.66s -> 28012.38s]  Oh okay.
[28012.38s -> 28012.86s]  Well thank you.
[28013.50s -> 28015.58s]  I'm sure it's delicious because you made it.
[28016.38s -> 28019.34s]  And I know it's going to be absolutely scrumptious.
[28029.92s -> 28031.44s]  Kim isn't modded or subbed.
[28033.04s -> 28035.12s]  Is that even the right, was that even the right Kim?
[28037.68s -> 28039.44s]  It's better than my rotten cooking.
[28039.44s -> 28042.80s]  You've never had the most succulent salmon of your life.
[28042.80s -> 28043.68s]  Unless you've had it by me.
[28044.32s -> 28044.82s]  Okay.
[28046.08s -> 28048.56s]  I do a butter au jus on top.
[28049.58s -> 28050.38s]  It goes in the pan.
[28050.38s -> 28050.94s]  I do the idea.
[28050.94s -> 28054.70s]  I tip, I put the oil in the butter and the cheese.
[28055.80s -> 28056.68s]  I tip it.
[28056.68s -> 28060.44s]  I do the Gordon Ramsay scoop, slap, scoop, splash, scoop, slap, scoop, splash.
[28060.44s -> 28062.04s]  Oh the oil gets all over it.
[28062.04s -> 28064.94s]  You baste it into the oven.
[28064.94s -> 28065.82s]  420 degrees.
[28067.15s -> 28067.63s]  It comes out.
[28067.63s -> 28069.47s]  You can smell the whole hell smells like it.
[28069.47s -> 28071.47s]  The whole house stinks like fish.
[28071.47s -> 28073.47s]  Like delicious salmon fish.
[28073.47s -> 28076.51s]  And it's wonderful you've never had anything more tasty in your whole life.
[28077.98s -> 28081.42s]  I sprinkle a little bit of rosemary just because I fucking can.
[28082.06s -> 28093.55s]  And then I do a little bit of a drizzle with EVOO.
[28093.55s -> 28097.77s]  Oh extra virgin olive oil.
[28098.97s -> 28100.65s]  And it's lemon infused.
[28101.53s -> 28103.77s]  Not your typical shit that you get on the grocery.
[28103.77s -> 28105.85s]  No they get a special order the lemon infused one.
[28107.48s -> 28109.40s]  Talk more about my cooking how it's not very good.
[28110.76s -> 28129.05s]  It sounds awful.
[28129.05s -> 28129.55s]  What?
[28131.92s -> 28138.24s]  I if you wanted me to I would do a cooking salmon infused lemon tang stream.
[28140.16s -> 28150.10s]  And I would show you all the whole house is gonna stink and it's gonna be great.
[28150.82s -> 28155.02s]  But anyways how do we get there?
[28155.02s -> 28157.58s]  Yeah I'm gonna play Resident Evil 2 probably on Monday.
[28158.14s -> 28160.78s]  Hey Mr Kool-Aid thanks for the one dollar since we're on the subject of Dreamcast.
[28160.78s -> 28162.38s]  I very much recommend Skies of Arcadia.
[28163.10s -> 28165.18s]  The world is vibrant.
[28165.18s -> 28167.82s]  The music is fantastic and it's genuinely fun RPG.
[28167.82s -> 28171.90s]  They did remaster it for Gamecube but back in the day it was the best reason for ever
[28171.90s -> 28173.34s]  owning a Dreamcast.
[28173.34s -> 28175.82s]  If you decide to play it it's quite the classic.
[28177.34s -> 28182.86s]  Another Dreamcast did have some of the best RPGs for its time.
[28184.11s -> 28191.23s]  Now long-winded 50 hour to 100 hour classic RPGs on the Dreamcast.
[28191.23s -> 28194.11s]  I'm not sure they'd be I don't think I'd want to stream them.
[28194.75s -> 28197.31s]  But I do appreciate that they exist.
[28201.12s -> 28202.24s]  What kind of pan do you use?
[28202.24s -> 28203.20s]  My hand.
[28203.20s -> 28204.00s]  I hold it in my hand.
[28204.00s -> 28205.04s]  I put my hand over the burner.
[28206.69s -> 28207.41s]  That's a pretty good job.
[28219.89s -> 28221.49s]  No you can do it in cast iron.
[28221.49s -> 28222.93s]  You can do it in a non-stick skillet.
[28222.93s -> 28224.53s]  You can do it in a pan in the oven.
[28225.33s -> 28226.37s]  Actually in the oven it's...
[28227.50s -> 28232.21s]  I actually prefer it in the oven because it can get it cooks all around.
[28232.21s -> 28234.61s]  And you take it out to get the medium rare texture inside.
[28235.97s -> 28241.65s]  Nice medium barely opaque flaking salmon buttery fish.
[28244.18s -> 28249.14s]  I would put my salmon up against any five-star restaurant salmon and win.
[28250.34s -> 28260.05s]  I don't care who it was.
[28264.45s -> 28268.93s]  Jerma is an insecure masochist who made up a salmon recipe to impress a bunch of...
[28268.93s -> 28269.17s]  What?
[28274.43s -> 28275.87s]  What are you talking about man?
[28275.87s -> 28279.07s]  Lifting shirt from neck grabbing and pulling.
[28280.83s -> 28281.79s]  What are you talking about man?
[28284.56s -> 28286.32s]  I'm really good at doing that.
[28290.75s -> 28292.67s]  Hey thank you Barry for the one dollar.
[28295.65s -> 28296.77s]  Jerma it's okay we understand.
[28296.77s -> 28298.21s]  Also please have a meet up in Vegas.
[28298.21s -> 28299.41s]  I go to college there.
[28300.05s -> 28302.86s]  I'll casino meet up.
[28304.59s -> 28305.15s]  Will we all...
[28305.15s -> 28307.39s]  A casino meet up where everybody gives a dollar
[28308.11s -> 28311.07s]  and we put a dollar on every single symbol at the roulette table.
[28312.46s -> 28316.78s]  No we make it so everyone goes in and we have everybody gives a dollar
[28317.58s -> 28321.18s]  and we just put like a hundred bucks on every single number
[28321.98s -> 28325.28s]  from double zero all the way to 35.
[28326.48s -> 28330.16s]  And then whatever hits we just you know that's good something's gonna hit
[28330.16s -> 28333.92s]  but they don't you know it that's 3500 bucks goes to charity.
[28334.72s -> 28343.86s]  But that would mean that they would be have to be way more
[28343.86s -> 28348.10s]  it would be like we'd just be losing like three or four or five thousand dollars.
[28348.10s -> 28350.18s]  Why wouldn't we just give 10 grand to charity?
[28351.14s -> 28362.16s]  That doesn't make any sense.
[28362.16s -> 28368.54s]  But I don't know I don't I don't I don't know I don't really do meetups
[28369.26s -> 28372.16s]  unless they're at like a convention or a place where I know I want to be or
[28373.12s -> 28376.05s]  I'm fucking I'm a weirdo guys.
[28378.18s -> 28384.06s]  I'm I don't I don't know those of you that have met me in real life
[28384.06s -> 28387.34s]  you probably can attest to the fact that like he was a fucking strange person.
[28389.06s -> 28392.26s]  You know he went like this that this and I scanned every item individually
[28392.26s -> 28394.90s]  and that that really happened and it was embarrassing.
[28395.70s -> 28416.72s]  I bet there's at least a couple of casinos that would be happy to host a charity roulette
[28416.72s -> 28420.56s]  game just to have the exposure and more people in the establishment playing other games.
[28421.52s -> 28425.52s]  You'd be surprised though a lot of those places are very very heavily regulated
[28426.32s -> 28430.80s]  and have very very very strict rules on what is allowed and not allowed.
[28432.48s -> 28442.14s]  That would be a tough cookie to sell I think because then they're very very particular.
[28446.21s -> 28447.65s]  Buy your own casino.
[28447.65s -> 28454.34s]  You know I had this weird dream and for some stupid dumb reason I looked up like leasing
[28454.34s -> 28455.86s]  prices in Vegas.
[28455.86s -> 28461.82s]  I had this weird dream about this like video game restaurant and I was like oh
[28461.82s -> 28465.02s]  that's kind of cool like on the strip that'd be cut look on the strip of Vegas
[28465.02s -> 28468.54s]  like a video game with like arcades like in like a cool menu
[28469.74s -> 28472.22s]  and like it serves alcohol but it's not Dave and Buster's
[28473.10s -> 28475.82s]  but it's like way better it'll be like a better version of Dave and Buster's
[28478.00s -> 28482.96s]  and it was like for three or four I think it was like $300,000 a year to lease it
[28482.96s -> 28492.61s]  like a place on the strip it'd be like Dave and Buster's but there's no prize games
[28492.61s -> 28497.25s]  it's more of a bar restaurant that has like three or four pinball machines
[28497.25s -> 28501.17s]  so it's not like Dave and Buster's at all it would be a bar restaurant that has three
[28501.17s -> 28506.61s]  or four pinball machines and a video game themed menu this is a bad idea
[28507.41s -> 28509.01s]  and I hope they deny me the loan.
[28518.34s -> 28520.58s]  Hey Tingy thanks for the two bucks what's this about you being naked
[28520.58s -> 28522.66s]  did I miss something while I was at work you didn't know
[28522.66s -> 28528.34s]  you didn't miss anything and what you did miss potentially was I was done on purpose
[28528.34s -> 28532.06s]  because it was funny you know
[28532.06s -> 28535.58s]  hey thank you Kinky for the one dollar snap your discs for more
[28538.06s -> 28542.22s]  not snapping a disc thank you Senator Chu Chi for the one dollar clueless sniper for the one
[28542.22s -> 28548.99s]  dollar thank you to Jug for the three dollars I would be down for arms level two emote
[28552.85s -> 28557.57s]  god uh special thanks for the one dollar hey Jeremy have you seen the Garfield game for
[28557.57s -> 28563.65s]  ps2 and pc it looks awful it's not Garfield cart and they link a speedrun I don't want to
[28563.65s -> 28566.13s]  look at it because if it's something I want to try them then I want to go in blind
[28567.25s -> 28572.13s]  thanks for the laughs from Australia it is Australia day happy Australia day
[28573.49s -> 28578.62s]  also please do the cooking stream perhaps invite the egg everybody loves the egg
[28579.79s -> 28582.83s]  but thank you uh if it's on ps2 or pc maybe I'll
[28583.71s -> 28586.70s]  but that would just push more Garfield I'm not sure if I want to do that
[28587.26s -> 28592.78s]  hey dr stein one dollar do a choose your own adventure cooking stream where you have a
[28592.78s -> 28597.66s]  shitload of ingredients and if chat choose which ones to use and when using the click feature
[28599.98s -> 28611.50s]  you are asking for me to burn down my kitchen that idea though choose your own adventure
