[0.95s -> 6.63s]  What? I'm trying to... I'm trying to do the thing. I'm trying to be a streamer. I'm trying to be a
[6.63s -> 16.63s]  streamer that has an intro play from one to a minute. We talked about this like a few days ago.
[19.19s -> 27.56s]  I'm trying to... All right, listen to me. Everybody that you watch on Twitch, I want... you know,
[27.56s -> 35.46s]  I want to get like an assessment, you know? What's the average starting soon screen time? I'm curious.
[35.46s -> 48.25s]  This is... no, this is important. What? 15 minutes? 15 minutes? Okay. I'm seeing a lot of 15 minutes.
[48.25s -> 57.93s]  10 minutes? 20 minutes? It's like 10 to 20 minutes? Okay. Zero minutes to an hour.
[62.70s -> 74.36s]  Pre-stream chat is that for you? Well, my question is, so if I'm late by 10 to 20 minutes,
[75.24s -> 81.03s]  at half the streams, aren't I just starting when most people would start usually after
[81.03s -> 95.35s]  a starting soon screen? Thinking phase, you know? No, because you don't wait for the notifications.
[96.15s -> 104.04s]  Oh, shit. Am I right? You're right. No, you're right. No, I had to take it on the phone. All right,
[104.04s -> 108.20s]  so the last couple days, I've had phone calls that have come in that are just like,
[108.20s -> 114.92s]  well, you have to answer this or your life is gonna fuck up. Oh, okay. I'm gonna answer that
[114.92s -> 130.38s]  phone call. I've had like two answer this or else phone calls in the last two days. No, it's not a
[130.38s -> 145.24s]  scam caller. That'll sound like fake calls to me. Anyways, how you doing, guys? Welcome back. We're
[145.24s -> 157.03s]  gonna play Black and White again, as you see on the title and from the tweet. Where we left it
[157.03s -> 166.68s]  last night is an actually pretty sad spot. Not a nice spot. Our new cow friend who we made last
[166.68s -> 173.67s]  night, the cow's name, by the way, is Murius. If you were not part of the pre-stream chat,
[176.20s -> 189.88s]  he's curious, he's a little furious, and he's a cow. He's Murius. Furious Murius. You can also say
[189.88s -> 207.78s]  curious Murius when he's doing something that's not so mean. Mald and Murius. Minus two. Hype train
[207.78s -> 215.98s]  incoming. What the fuck was that? What was that? You will have a limited time to earn exclusive
[215.98s -> 226.50s]  emotes. What is this? What's going on? Hype train at 82%. What the fuck is this? Sub gift or use bits
[226.50s -> 236.89s]  to get to the next level. What? I don't know what this is. Is this new? 100% we did it, apparently.
[238.26s -> 246.68s]  Hooray. Hype. I don't know what that was. I didn't enable this. This is like a birthday part. Level
[246.68s -> 258.01s]  one complete. Level two hype train. Okay, what is this, Twitch? I don't, what, we have five
[258.01s -> 270.95s]  minutes to do this? This is so, this is so obvious. I don't know what the fuck this is. I swear to
[270.95s -> 281.08s]  God. I was like talking about my cow. Wait, hold on, people are just giving a shit load of subs right
[281.08s -> 293.78s]  now. What the fuck? Hold on. Hype train. Hype. What is going on? What do you mean level two complete?
[295.48s -> 300.28s]  How many levels are there? No, there's three, there's more than three levels?
[306.92s -> 313.22s]  Level three hype train. Can I, I can click this button? Completing level three requires
[315.00s -> 320.10s]  hype conductors. What the, what is a hype conductor? This is like a train conductor,
[320.10s -> 328.49s]  a current hype train tops level three emotes. Wait, you're unlocking emotes like these weird
[328.49s -> 338.22s]  train monsters? We just got to level five? What level are we? Okay, hold on. I can't even keep
[338.22s -> 344.47s]  up with how many people just subbing right now. All right, you got more emotes. Thanks for the hype
[346.17s -> 352.73s]  train. I don't know if we've been selected to test a new feature, but apparently we're testing it.
[354.07s -> 366.07s]  Uh, level four hype train. Okay, at some point we have to get off of the train.
[368.34s -> 374.54s]  Sub gift. All right, let me see what this even is supposed to be for. Oh my God. All right,
[377.02s -> 386.25s]  guys, I, it never stops. No, it has to stop at some, you can't ride a train this fast.
[387.70s -> 393.46s]  75% level four. Oh man. Level wages. Dead. Level four hype train.
[397.30s -> 408.84s]  All right. All right. So now that's it, right? Now we can, did we do it? Level four complete.
[418.76s -> 421.56s]  I'm going to look this, I'm going to look this up. Hold on.
[422.46s -> 427.26s]  Hype train Twitch. I feel like I'm going to get like a bunch of compilation videos.
[427.26s -> 433.43s]  Hype train guide. I can't fucking believe this is happening so close to
[434.07s -> 440.10s]  the new year's Eve stream. Hype train incoming. Hype train is a super size celebration when
[440.10s -> 446.33s]  community members unite to support a streamer that they love. Well, thank you guys. It challenges
[446.33s -> 457.34s]  the community to reach epic levels of hype and reward. But when did this start? Oh my fucking
[457.34s -> 467.82s]  God. This is like, you, you've Twitch, you've gamified hype meters now. Oh my God.
[475.10s -> 480.78s]  So many subs and bits are coming in. I can't even fucking comprehend. I can't even, I,
[480.78s -> 488.73s]  we got to go to the beginning here. I haven't even done an intro yet. Hype. You did it.
[490.98s -> 494.34s]  Level five. It has to stop somewhere. Look, what does it, what does it say?
[495.61s -> 503.29s]  What does it say for? All right. You did it. We did it. You did it. You did a level five hype train.
[506.41s -> 521.66s]  135%. There ain't going over this. 140. I mean, it doesn't stop. Well, there's three minutes.
[524.42s -> 535.54s]  150%. You guys are fucking crazy, man. Well, that's an interesting feature.
[536.50s -> 546.31s]  It just activates when, holy shit. You guys don't even have to do this. You already unlocked level
[546.31s -> 555.24s]  five. You got, you're at 175%. You don't even have to do this anymore. You've already, we've
[555.24s -> 565.77s]  hyped ourselves into, into outer space. You did it. I just wish it wasn't called hype train.
[566.41s -> 572.65s]  Cause it is like, it does the hype thing at the top. Can I customize that so it doesn't say hype?
[574.28s -> 585.64s]  Can it say, I don't even know. Almost 200%. Two minutes until this clock runs out and,
[586.28s -> 596.22s]  and I get subbed and gifted another two to 300 times. Thank you guys. I did not know this feature
[596.22s -> 601.18s]  was even coming through, but just remember, I'm going to be very clear about this. The ridiculous,
[601.18s -> 608.78s]  insane, like top 30 on Twitch in sub numbers, top 40 on Twitch in sub numbers. And
[609.58s -> 617.78s]  incoming money. I'm going to fucking use it. I'm going to use it for this stream. I promise you,
[619.08s -> 636.09s]  a million percent, 246% of this experimental feature. He's going to use it on cocaine.
[636.81s -> 644.22s]  I don't do drugs. If I pissed in the wee, I don't do drugs. It's a monumental task
[645.72s -> 656.89s]  for me to even thank any of you. I, it's so, it's, this is like, it has to be one of the most
[656.89s -> 662.57s]  generous supportive communities on Twitch. It has to be. I can't even begin to tell you how much I
[662.57s -> 675.94s]  can say thanks. Honest to God, it's, it has to be up in the top 20. It has to be. The hype train
[675.94s -> 694.04s]  is at 333%. Get it to 420. 400%. This is the shit you didn't even need to do. Here it comes.
[694.60s -> 706.46s]  The clock is running out at 350. Hype train success. Okay. Now there's the, such strong support.
[706.54s -> 716.54s]  Level five completed. Now what do you all get? 182 subs at 24,000 fucking bits. What in the name
[716.54s -> 728.06s]  of God? We're delivering emotes. You guys have emotes now? Great work. Emotes are being delivered
[728.06s -> 742.84s]  to supporters. Hype unicorn three. What even are these? Can I customize those? All right,
[742.84s -> 752.74s]  if I can customize those, I'm going to make them fucking, I can't, no. Make a hype cow.
[756.07s -> 763.69s]  Once again, everybody, I can't even, my brain has trouble with this shit because I can't even
[763.69s -> 769.80s]  fathom something like this happening. And I just want, I just want to have fun. I just want,
[769.80s -> 774.04s]  I just want us to have fun together as a group of people. I just want, that's it. That's all
[774.04s -> 777.72s]  I care about. You know what I mean? Like it's hard for me to even say thanks because I don't
[777.72s -> 782.68s]  even know what to fucking do. It's just like ridiculous. I hope you fucking have fun. I really
[782.68s -> 791.58s]  do. Let's, let's have some fun. Somebody gave 20, Furious Bear 20 subs. We're going to, there's
[791.58s -> 797.66s]  going to be a long outro tonight. I will tell you because there was a, there was $50 too. There's
[797.66s -> 812.86s]  like $50 like five times. Holy shit. Somebody gave 100, 200 where? AB Joe gave 5,000 bits. They
[812.86s -> 823.29s]  said keep going. That's, so how do you, how does that even happen? Is it just random? Well, Twitch,
[823.29s -> 832.10s]  if you just released this and you'd like to get some beta feedback, here it is. Like there you are.
[832.10s -> 842.55s]  You just got a bunch of it. But thank you, AB Joe 5,000. Oh my God. That's the loudest one of the
[842.55s -> 846.23s]  year. Clip that one. That has to be the lot. That's the loudest room that's ever happened.
[846.87s -> 857.98s]  Seriously, like I won't even need a category. That was next to the window. Fiddy, thanks for
[857.98s -> 866.50s]  the 5,000 bits. I'm pogging so hard right now. You guys are fucking too much. Well,
[868.06s -> 876.22s]  top fucking goddamn 40. Top 30. Let's go. Let's go. Let's, let's, let's, let's take this whole
[876.22s -> 884.38s]  fucking website over. You know what I mean? Let's go. Let's, let's, let's, let's do it.
[885.02s -> 891.29s]  You guys should get fucking hyped for this channel. You should fucking feel excited for it,
[891.29s -> 896.01s]  especially considering we're about to play black and white for like another eight hours.
[896.57s -> 912.17s]  Oh, whoa, whoa. What are you doing? No, but for real, for real, for real, for real.
[913.82s -> 921.18s]  Oh yeah. Here we go. Everybody. Let's go hype trade. Hype me up. German 985. Okay. I mean like
[922.31s -> 929.99s]  that's over here. What's that thing? Oh, that's a tree. I need more of those. Yeah. Put that over
[934.33s -> 941.37s]  Adam, Adam laughing my ass off gave a fucking hundred dollars right now. Thanks for the,
[942.47s -> 949.46s]  thanks for the 10,000 bits, dude. Well, that was an interesting first 15 minutes of the stream.
[953.06s -> 960.04s]  We've been in the middle of the intro. What were we talking about? I don't know. What were we
[960.04s -> 968.34s]  talking about? It was something important. It was the cow. Oh yeah. The cow's name is Murius.
[969.30s -> 975.53s]  Murius. The cow and everyone, I got a lot of shit for that name. People like, oh, Murius,
[975.53s -> 980.33s]  come on. Like curious, furious, whatever. Yeah. But you know what the number one suggestion was
[980.33s -> 987.53s]  last night? I looked over here and you know what it was? It's mega milk. So I think my name might
[987.53s -> 1001.30s]  have been like a tad better than the number one suggestion. All right. But oh, that's right.
[1001.30s -> 1005.86s]  Those of you that weren't here last night, we have, that's a sad tale right now. While I was
[1005.86s -> 1015.03s]  going off on the sad tale on the intro, Murius was captured and is being tortured right now
[1015.03s -> 1026.10s]  over there. And we have to go save him pretty. Yeah. And that is what's happening. I am going
[1026.10s -> 1031.37s]  to go, I'm going to build up the city. Somebody said last night, I'm going to take this to heart.
[1032.01s -> 1039.21s]  They said in direct quotes, when you can look at the logs, they said, LOL, he is not ever going
[1039.21s -> 1043.21s]  to beat the third level because he didn't pay attention to one of the most important mechanics.
[1044.54s -> 1049.42s]  So I'm going to beat the third level because now I'm ready. I'm going to make sure that I have
[1049.42s -> 1055.59s]  shit ready to go. I'm going to pay attention. And I paid attention yesterday too. But anyways,
[1055.59s -> 1065.53s]  welcome back everybody. Playing black and white again. All right. So we need wood. Oops. Okay.
[1065.91s -> 1072.46s]  We need wood. Where's my wood center? Because these people are all, here's my temple, right? Okay.
[1074.06s -> 1081.46s]  I need some, where's my temple going? Why is this much louder? Oh, it's because I've opened the game.
[1082.26s -> 1090.68s]  When you open the game and all the volume shit goes crazy. Music is, where's the music? Should
[1090.68s -> 1098.71s]  we be getting music? I think I broke the music by like turning it off. All right. That's better.
[1099.35s -> 1105.32s]  There we go. Cutting the trees. How much wood do they need? Oh, I can just do this. I can help.
[1106.84s -> 1113.05s]  Let's get this temple built. How much more does it need?
[1113.69s -> 1125.16s]  3200. Why does it need so much wood? Bring back mega milk. He's, look, I'll show you. He's currently
[1125.16s -> 1129.59s]  being tortured right now. You want to see this? You really want to see this? I can't do anything
[1129.59s -> 1142.38s]  about this. There he is. But look at that will. He seems pretty chill. It's because he's frozen
[1142.38s -> 1148.90s]  in a weird ice thing. And by the way, this motherfucker is dead. Just wait till I train
[1148.90s -> 1152.58s]  with Murius and bring him over here. See, look what he's doing. He's just like burning me. I
[1152.58s -> 1165.10s]  got to get over there. He's got his hands on his hips. We got a long way to go for the saving of
[1165.10s -> 1171.82s]  Murius. There's other towns over here. All right, let's keep going. He does always have that Disney
[1171.82s -> 1184.26s]  character. Hands on hips, waving at people. All right, we need 1800 wood. Let's go. I need to
[1184.26s -> 1195.98s]  replant some trees. I miss them already. I really do. All right, we got it. We're good. Nice fax
[1195.98s -> 1208.92s]  machine. I need to put wood over here. But this shit needs it bad. Did you know? Yeah, yeah. Okay,
[1208.92s -> 1213.51s]  this is the store. Somebody, we got to get a builder over here. How many of you guys are builders?
[1214.07s -> 1219.50s]  What are you? Going to the forest for wood. No, no, no, no, no, not anymore. You're not. Come over here.
[1220.22s -> 1222.14s]  We got to get this shit built up.
[1225.72s -> 1234.98s]  Resident builder. Deciding what to do. I can decide for you. Come here. Builders.
[1237.14s -> 1246.52s]  All right, we got extra wood. This is extra, right? Yeah. I think that person just fell
[1246.52s -> 1254.71s]  off the cliff. Supply this shit. All right, come on. Hurry up. I got to like be efficient here.
[1258.22s -> 1273.99s]  Wait, did I just? What? Oh, fuck. That wasn't done. All right, all right, all right. This does not
[1273.99s -> 1282.92s]  seem like a good idea. Where are they going? I think, wait, what's this? Oh, I found a wood
[1282.92s -> 1289.77s]  miracle. Nice. All right, let's put it, uh, I'm gonna put it over here. Miracle of wood.
[1292.73s -> 1308.55s]  All right, I need 751. We'll just drop it in here. Oh, get on that hype train. All right,
[1308.55s -> 1323.53s]  somebody build it. Let's, what was that? Is this mine? I think all this shit is mine.
[1325.58s -> 1334.95s]  Shut up about the hype train. I'm kidding around. Don't worry. All right, give me that rock.
[1335.83s -> 1342.07s]  How much more wood does this need? Scaffold value three. No, I mean like build it then.
[1342.07s -> 1348.41s]  What is it? What's, what's taking, what's the hold up? Is it not buildable?
[1349.61s -> 1360.26s]  I guess I might have to wait. Rescue mega milk. That's the goal. That's not who that is though.
[1360.26s -> 1369.46s]  And I don't care if you keep calling him super milk. His name is Murius and I were not calling
[1369.46s -> 1377.83s]  him the thing that you are calling. Let's get a builder over here. Disciple Forester. No, no,
[1377.83s -> 1387.43s]  no, no, no, no. Disciple builder. Almost done. Good. Mega milk is easier to spell. It's also
[1387.43s -> 1398.60s]  porn from what I've been told. So I know that's not what it is. I mean, no, it's not.
[1401.91s -> 1413.22s]  It's not. It is. It's not. It is. Well, is it or isn't it? The last time I said those two words
[1413.22s -> 1419.86s]  together out loud, like a few weeks ago, I saw a scene of dude, shoot, shut the fuck up, dude.
[1419.86s -> 1425.54s]  You don't know what you're saying. Stop saying this. Shut up, dude. Stop. Like you were nudging
[1425.54s -> 1429.30s]  me at like the fucking dinner table. We were in front of your parents and you're like, don't
[1429.30s -> 1446.15s]  fucking say that in front of my mom and dad, dude. Are you stupid? So I don't know how much wood we
[1446.15s -> 1456.92s]  get. We're running out of wood. Oh, are we? Not anymore. Look at my miracles. Oh, wait, that was
[1456.92s -> 1466.49s]  a rock. Fuck. Fix this. Fix it. The village stored is nearly out of food. Fix it. Fix it. He's in
[1466.49s -> 1473.69s]  perpetual motion. Oh, no. Fix this. I didn't mean to do that. Oh, god damn it. When am I going to
[1473.69s -> 1481.82s]  get? I almost just called him the thing that I'm not supposed to call him. How do I repair
[1481.82s -> 1503.70s]  the building? What the fuck, man? All right. It's it's under construction again. All right,
[1503.70s -> 1512.06s]  we're good. Wear the shirt. I'm not going to wear the shirt. Hypers. Oh, I can't even.
[1512.86s -> 1522.92s]  I can't keep up. I can't keep up. I know. Well, I mean, where's the it's over here.
[1524.04s -> 1533.24s]  Is that the only one that has to be more than that around here? Right. I was going to say holy
[1533.32s -> 1538.44s]  shit. All right, we've got to we've got to take care of this shit right now. I need a builder.
[1539.08s -> 1553.83s]  I need more. All right, take it slow. 80. Fucking idiot. What am I? I'm like bird.
[1554.95s -> 1569.06s]  I need more wood for this. Actually, they're they're making food. Not a lot, but they are.
[1570.73s -> 1576.90s]  Yeah, they need food right now. I know. I know. I'm working on it. Come over here. Start working
[1576.90s -> 1581.94s]  in these fields over here. Disciple farmer. Actually, that's great. I'm actually really
[1581.94s -> 1587.21s]  happy. This is perfect. Even if not, if a rival god did this, I don't even care.
[1588.17s -> 1605.77s]  You're helping me. All right, we need people to work down here. You work over here. Disciple
[1605.77s -> 1611.43s]  farmer. Children's Day. Yeah, I got to fix this though. What is this person doing?
[1614.10s -> 1618.74s]  This is a weird spot, isn't it? Oh shit. He was carrying something. He was trying to fix the
[1618.74s -> 1623.70s]  orphanage. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, he was trying to get up there to
[1623.70s -> 1635.82s]  fix the orphanage. I got you. I got you. They can't get up here. See, it's in a way, it's in
[1635.82s -> 1653.88s]  like a fucked up spot. Can I move this? I didn't put this here. They can't get in. I don't think
[1653.88s -> 1662.36s]  they can get in there. It's in a weird angle. Okay, well, I have temple here. All right, let's get
[1662.36s -> 1675.22s]  the uh, is this thing almost done? Do they eat this person? All right, then we need food now.
[1675.22s -> 1681.00s]  Uh-oh. There's uh, oh, we need. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. I need to make, I need a miracle.
[1682.68s -> 1694.42s]  I can look for miracles. You're, okay, you're doing food. Who else is doing food? This still
[1694.42s -> 1700.79s]  needs to be built. Shitty pathing, too. This is all wrong. I didn't even build this shit. This was
[1700.79s -> 1707.75s]  given to me. I would have much better spot. All right. Disciple. No, no, do not breed.
[1709.32s -> 1715.94s]  Disciple builder. How much more wood? Zero? Okay, come here. We need people to make food.
[1719.51s -> 1722.63s]  Disciple farmer. The shit is so far away from where they need to be. The village store is
[1722.63s -> 1728.71s]  nearly out of food. You're running out of trees. I can make trees. Plus, I can steal them. I can
[1728.71s -> 1739.86s]  take trees from wherever I want. If the god next door is angry at me. Okay, now I need to do houses.
[1740.50s -> 1748.17s]  You're a liar and a thief. I don't see any food. All right, what's down here?
[1750.12s -> 1755.88s]  Okay, here's the next town over. Is this a neutral town? This town down here is neutral.
[1756.44s -> 1763.50s]  What do you got? They got a lot of food in here. All right, I need to send some people down here.
[1764.22s -> 1768.31s]  There's food near the orphanage. Yeah, somebody has to get it though.
[1768.95s -> 1776.49s]  That was, this orphanage is fucked up. All right, should I just like take it?
[1777.77s -> 1784.74s]  No, no, no, no, no. They have to do this themselves. You come here. Disciple farmer.
[1784.74s -> 1788.50s]  We need more farmers. What, what are you guys all up to? Going to farm, going to farm.
[1790.71s -> 1796.23s]  Who else? Going to a building site. No, no, no. Farm. Farm instead. Come here.
[1797.29s -> 1806.33s]  Disciple farmer. Big bits just came in. More big bits. All right. Crookshire gave 5,000 bits.
[1808.15s -> 1815.77s]  Another 50 fucking dollars. And they say this chat is hype. Get over here.
[1818.92s -> 1824.62s]  Disciple farmer. Hype. Getting another important phone call.
[1825.42s -> 1836.87s]  God damn it. It's going to have to wait. Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing.
[1836.87s -> 1845.74s]  Where are these people? What is this place? What do you mean dancing? Where are they?
[1851.83s -> 1857.91s]  Isn't this the production store? Oh my god. I, I gotta, okay.
[1861.90s -> 1871.21s]  Good. More food. Farm. All, everybody farm. Only farm. What's this person? This person,
[1871.21s -> 1885.35s]  this is Jeff Keely. What is Jeff Keely doing in this game? Steve Jackson is in this game.
[1885.99s -> 1902.04s]  That's the, that's sorcery. Wait, are these all game people? Did somebody just who? Steve Jackson?
[1907.02s -> 1914.54s]  Wait, did, okay. I was going to say that was not like, that wasn't Jeff Keely, right? All right.
[1914.54s -> 1918.46s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Forget about this fucking temple. Going to dead person. No. Come
[1918.46s -> 1932.65s]  here. No. Stop going to dead person and go get food. Farm. Disciple farmer. Farm. Disciple farmer.
[1933.54s -> 1946.10s]  They have to mourn. Age 82. All right. My crea- wait a minute. Am I going to get another creature to
[1946.10s -> 1961.48s]  rescue? Are we going to go on a rescue mission with a new creature? Disciple farmer. All right.
[1961.48s -> 1968.41s]  Well, thankfully it rains a lot. Water. Food. All right. I need to do this. I need a food miracle.
[1968.41s -> 1983.29s]  I need a site. What's that thing called? I need that thing to tell me. I need more wood in there.
[1989.24s -> 1994.97s]  What's it called? The thing that makes some worshipers can go worship.
[1998.39s -> 2010.18s]  All right. At least there's food in there now. All right. Come on. Build it. I need 4,900 more
[2010.18s -> 2024.20s]  wood. All right. It's time to start dumping trees. All right. Done. Where? Wood. Tree dump. I know I'm
[2024.20s -> 2037.48s]  ripping up everything here. I know. But I have to start moving. I'm only going to take the big
[2037.48s -> 2051.54s]  ones. Not the little ones. I promise. Okay. Is this done? Almost. You're going to have no trees.
[2051.54s -> 2060.06s]  I can do a spell that gives me trees. Plus, Murius will probably- doesn't Murius know that spell too?
[2060.06s -> 2072.01s]  Oh no. Murius knows wood, right? All right. What is it for? Does anybody remember what it is for
[2072.01s -> 2084.42s]  that worship site? Say his name, Jeremy. Who are we talking about? Talking about Murius.
[2088.63s -> 2121.38s]  Murius is the- okay. Bear with me here. Say his name, Jeremy. Say his name. Do it. Do it.
[2121.38s -> 2128.36s]  How much more wood do I need? At least there's a little dollop of fucking gravy in there. All
[2128.36s -> 2141.96s]  right. Is this almost done? How much more does this have to do? I don't want to breed anybody yet. I
[2142.04s -> 2149.88s]  don't want any breeding that's going to cause a huge problem. I need to build houses. I need more
[2149.88s -> 2173.74s]  wood. My best friend is being tortured. I'm not in a good- I don't like this. But anybody in chat
[2173.74s -> 2184.06s]  can help me out here. Don't break it! Okay. Jesus Christ. That was scary. What's the recipe for-
[2184.94s -> 2211.22s]  Get my temples done. All right. My influence grows. Okay. Now your temple looks sinister.
[2211.22s -> 2220.84s]  It's- I assure you it's not. Oh, what are they doing here? Is this the worship site? It is,
[2220.84s -> 2231.93s]  isn't it? All right. Finally. Took long enough. Build that site up. We need to pray- I'm trying.
[2232.49s -> 2246.92s]  I'm trying. I need to make a food spell and- Do not get hit by that rock, please. All right. Is it
[2246.92s -> 2255.46s]  done? Okay. Here we go. Wow. You did it. Everybody. And I mean everyone. Everyone to the temple. Now,
[2255.46s -> 2263.13s]  immediately drop everything you're doing and worship me. Tell me kind things. Tell me I'm smart.
[2263.13s -> 2272.36s]  Tell me I'm fun. We're going to have to sacrifice a couple people too. Yeah. Yeah. Who's-
[2282.06s -> 2290.70s]  Food! It's already gone. Oh my God. It's already gone. They're so hungry.
[2292.22s -> 2298.89s]  I can't- It won't even show up on the ground. We have to sacrifice somebody.
[2298.89s -> 2311.03s]  I seriously can't even get it to show up on the ground. All right. Somebody else has to die.
[2316.23s -> 2342.39s]  Yay. They're eating it instantly. All right. Who's dead? No. More. All right. Fill it up.
[2347.54s -> 2363.48s]  Keep believing. Keep believing. Continue believing in me. I need better fucking- I'm gonna
[2363.48s -> 2380.09s]  always be in need of food. More. How's everybody doing? We need food. I know. Uh oh. Okay. All
[2380.09s -> 2383.37s]  right. All right. All right. All right. One more and then I'm going to drop it down to like 30%.
[2387.06s -> 2396.82s]  Miracle food. I'm going to sacrifice one more person. Okay. That's good. I just dropped the
[2396.82s -> 2404.76s]  food over here. Whoops. I'll get it. Back to work. Sacrificing people means less people that need to
[2404.76s -> 2410.44s]  eat. This is true, but it also means I have to make sure that I'm not going to be unbreedable.
[2411.32s -> 2420.34s]  I don't want to kill everybody. All right. So now we still have these people there.
[2421.22s -> 2430.89s]  Give me more food. They switch off, right? What do you mean unbreedable? Like if there's- if I kill
[2430.89s -> 2437.37s]  all the men in the area, if I kill all the women, then there ain't going to be any more babies.
[2437.93s -> 2448.18s]  That's what I mean. All right. It's time to start growing influence. Everyone. How's everybody doing?
[2448.18s -> 2452.50s]  Everyone okay? Going to sleep on the floor. Okay. Now it's time for me to build.
[2453.30s -> 2467.38s]  Uh, what are they doing over here? What is Jeff Keeley building? What is this? Is this a game
[2467.38s -> 2486.02s]  awards arena? Maybe. He's building a statue of Kojima. What the fuck? Well, is this a house?
[2486.02s -> 2496.81s]  Maybe they're doing that on their own. All right. We're okay. I need to make a couple more houses.
[2497.61s -> 2507.18s]  Another civic building. All right. It's time to start ripping trees out. I need to build more
[2507.66s -> 2515.99s]  shit over here because I need to spread into here and take this place over. I also need this shit
[2515.99s -> 2524.23s]  too. I- I feel like this building is not being used. Like it can't be used. Oh, they are. They're
[2524.23s -> 2533.78s]  making settlements. What did you guys? Okay. Uh, let's go over here. Let's get some- let's get more
[2533.78s -> 2543.75s]  food. I'm going to get this to about 10,000. What's in there now? 4,000. Now do it like two,
[2543.75s -> 2555.56s]  three more times. You already forgot about Mega. I did not. Hey Streamer, just letting me know your
[2555.56s -> 2565.85s]  face cam is on. Oh, how embarrassing. I need a ton more wood. Where is there a forest I can just
[2565.85s -> 2581.83s]  rip out of? Save the cow? To save the cow, I need a strong enough base of followers. I can't just
[2581.83s -> 2588.65s]  go save the cow. Damn it. I really need a bunch of more wood. All right. Let's zoom this out so
[2588.65s -> 2597.74s]  I can see and just dump it into there. 7,600 wood. I need way more than that. I'll replace it.
[2598.38s -> 2621.69s]  How much wood is in there now? 8,300. Okay. I need like 20,000 wood because that's going to help me
[2621.69s -> 2632.52s]  build more civic buildings, which is what I need, right? 20,000 and I'm done. And then I'll plant a
[2632.52s -> 2638.92s]  fake forest. I'll plant a magic forest eventually. Don't worry. This is all going to get replaced.
[2639.64s -> 2657.48s]  Is that a rock? No. All right. What is that? 14,000? Not bad. Not bad. Not bad. Not bad. Not bad.
[2659.50s -> 2669.54s]  No complaints yet. Yet. Don't pick the little ones. Only the baby. Here we go. I keep hearing
[2669.54s -> 2676.66s]  somebody scream. Who's this monster that keeps fucking screaming? All right. Do food again.
[2684.66s -> 2692.84s]  Everybody's taken care of now. I'll do one more food and then I'm out of trees and shit. I'm
[2692.84s -> 2700.42s]  going to have to do tree miracles, wood miracles. Your son is screaming in pain.
[2702.49s -> 2711.13s]  My son's not a miracle food. All right. Let's start making shit. I need a civic building,
[2711.13s -> 2726.18s]  right? I need three. That's two there already. I already have one. So what do I need to do to get
[2729.62s -> 2740.60s]  worshippers to be able to help me move out and continue? I hope I'm trapped. I just need more
[2740.60s -> 2755.10s]  people. All right. Well, I'm going to do it. I'm going to do a big house. This isn't a boat. All
[2755.10s -> 2761.35s]  right. Let's put this. I wish I could make another one of those. I'm going to put this down here so
[2761.35s -> 2770.66s]  people can farm easier over here. You know, we're going to make these people over here the farmers.
[2771.54s -> 2781.53s]  Workshop. Here we go. All right. How do I cycle between what these are? Graveyard.
[2782.33s -> 2791.14s]  Should I make a graveyard of dead people? Do people like that? I need the graveyard.
[2795.86s -> 2805.61s]  How do you cycle between this shit? Workshop. No, I don't have enough influence to go that way yet.
[2805.61s -> 2812.31s]  How about down here? How did the graveyard down here? But it's not the graveyard yet.
[2813.03s -> 2825.05s]  Make another abode. I got to put that in a better spot. I wish I could make a farm over here.
[2828.17s -> 2836.78s]  All right. Making an abode. Abode right there. And then another abode right here.
[2837.58s -> 2847.37s]  Okay. So now people can actually live here and work here.
[2849.21s -> 2863.40s]  It's four scaffolds for a field. Oh, fuck. Okay. Let's do that. Do you put a storm? Get down.
[2873.53s -> 2879.64s]  Miracle food. So four and I'll put another field down. Yeah, that's a good idea.
[2880.60s -> 2891.93s]  I do need more wood though. Fuck. This game's so fun. All right. I need more wood. Let's do
[2891.93s -> 2896.97s]  the wood miracle. What is it? This one. Here it is. I don't have a wood miracle. Uh-oh.
[2898.01s -> 2920.36s]  Oh, that's very bad. That's very bad. Miracle food. I have to. This is very bad. Under the
[2920.36s -> 2925.91s]  waterfall. This is that dispenser. Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah. I did grab this. You're right.
[2926.87s -> 2942.63s]  Okay. How much wood do you need? That's not a whole lot though. That's not a whole lot of wood.
[2943.35s -> 2953.82s]  All right. It's four you said, right? We need another field. Oh, no. Maybe I should start
[2953.82s -> 2964.06s]  breeding the fuck out of everybody. What do you think? Pick up and replace the trees.
[2973.72s -> 2974.22s]  Water.
[2974.22s -> 2977.34s]  A miracle shower.
[2979.96s -> 2995.12s]  Hold on. Should I just water shit? This is not like Stardew Valley, right? Hey.
[2999.66s -> 3019.84s]  Oh, okay. It's four. What should I do here? I have five. Bigger house, civic building,
[3019.84s -> 3027.90s]  make a field, make a new village center. What words to make a field? Should I make a field?
[3028.86s -> 3042.92s]  Build a streamer house. I'm going to make a field. Here we go. Field. And I'm going to put this
[3042.92s -> 3048.60s]  shit. That's only one field. All right. I'm going to put this right. I'm going to put this over here
[3048.60s -> 3054.28s]  because this is too far of a walk. And then I'll put, I get to put like a new store building over
[3054.28s -> 3063.48s]  there. All right. I'm going to put it right here. That's a, that's a long, that's not, I don't want
[3063.48s -> 3072.62s]  that to be a long walk. All right. Food is starting to become a surplus. I have to work. What are you
[3072.62s -> 3082.68s]  doing? Don't sleep off. All right. Trees. Trees. I need, did I, did I just fuck this whole play
[3082.68s -> 3101.04s]  through because I pulled up all the trees. I can do this. Look, look what I'm doing.
[3102.12s -> 3121.12s]  I'm relocating this forest over here. Theft. This is not theft. Maybe not yet. I'm going to water
[3121.12s -> 3146.06s]  these trees after and we'll see what happens. Okay. Just let it go. Let it go. Let it go. Stop. Let
[3146.06s -> 3156.83s]  it give me. All right. There's only one more. Look at all this over here too. Okay. Miracle of water.
[3156.83s -> 3178.33s]  Let's go. All right. Let's see what happens. Do they grow? How are we doing over here? Is my field
[3178.33s -> 3189.26s]  done? No one's even started building this yet. Where is everybody? Somebody build this. All right.
[3189.26s -> 3197.53s]  Jeff Keighley. Build this. You're going to do it now. Like Jeff Keighley. You're really good at like
[3197.53s -> 3203.28s]  building shit. I've already seen you build like two. All right. You don't want to. Just do it.
[3204.16s -> 3224.35s]  He doesn't want to. Going to sleep on floor. I need more houses. Holy shit. You live a dangerous
[3224.35s -> 3232.12s]  life. Going to sleep on the floor at the edge of the cliff where the waterfall is. Sleeping upside
[3232.12s -> 3256.27s]  down. Insane. All right. So. Leave it. I'm not worth it. What just happened? I don't know what
[3256.27s -> 3283.77s]  that was. Was that another god? Actor. Is this the person talking? He's rehearsing his lines.
[3283.77s -> 3295.72s]  Should I just go get him? All right. I'm going to go get him. Actor. Go on. He's dumb. I got him.
[3300.11s -> 3314.49s]  Okay. Now. Breed? I'll do your worst but don't throw me though.
[3315.93s -> 3319.29s]  That the game's telling me to throw this person. But no. We're going to. We're going to breed?
[3320.25s -> 3328.28s]  Wait. Just what? What? What happened? You big bully. Try it again and you're dead.
[3332.43s -> 3339.63s]  Please don't throw me. Oh you big bully. Try it again and you're dead. Please don't throw me.
[3339.63s -> 3366.72s]  You didn't kill me. Please don't throw me. Uh. Why are we getting a slow mo cut scene?
[3368.49s -> 3377.79s]  Oh hell. You big bully. Try it again and you're dead. Please don't throw me. What?
[3380.11s -> 3396.19s]  What is this? Guy getting a special cut scene. Oh hell. Free influence. You didn't kill me.
[3396.19s -> 3407.79s]  Please don't throw me. Hey guys. Look at this. He's. Okay. You remember that game. Like kick
[3407.79s -> 3414.49s]  the buddy. That old flash game where he's like. Come on. Don't hit me. You like punch him and
[3414.49s -> 3418.49s]  poke him and stuff and he gets up and does this. Oh you big. Please don't throw me.
[3424.22s -> 3441.28s]  Oh hell. Am I getting points for this? You didn't kill me. Please don't throw me. Watch out lady.
[3442.00s -> 3452.33s]  Keep this guy in a box to him. You didn't kill me. Please don't throw me. All right. What do I need
[3452.33s -> 3468.32s]  for. How much belief do I need? He keeps flying. Is that him screaming in slow motion? Do it as
[3468.32s -> 3475.05s]  far as possible. Oh man. You didn't kill me. Please don't throw me. This actually is just
[3475.05s -> 3479.53s]  free influence though. All right. Fine. He's going for a long ride.
[3499.47s -> 3504.51s]  Oh you big bully. Try it again and you're dead. Please don't throw me.
[3506.19s -> 3522.32s]  What am I supposed to do with this guy? Oh hell. Kill him. I can't. Oh you big bully. Try it again
[3522.32s -> 3533.85s]  and you're dead. Please don't throw me. Ladies and gentlemen. The flying man. Are you not impressed
[3533.85s -> 3543.66s]  by the skills of the gods? My leg. Just know me. You didn't kill me. Please don't throw me.
[3544.30s -> 3555.23s]  I can't. All right. He's coming with me. Come with me. Oh there's a quest. All right. He's
[3555.23s -> 3559.47s]  coming with me. How do I lock him somewhere? How do I keep him somewhere? Should I just put a series
[3559.47s -> 3567.31s]  of rocks around him? Why would I do that in my own village? Well he's dead. He doesn't.
[3573.07s -> 3579.31s]  Feed him. Oh that's right. I'll feed him to the animal. On my arm. All right. Let him. You didn't
[3579.31s -> 3586.56s]  kill me. Whatever. He's called actor. There's a scroll over here. What was it? I just saw it
[3586.56s -> 3607.66s]  right there. What is that? Ah I see a god. Greetings. I am a guru and a yogi. I am off
[3607.66s -> 3614.54s]  to meditate and increase my powers. I have a secret place for this. Please don't follow me there.
[3614.54s -> 3625.98s]  That is all. So we follow him there. Right. You know what? Let's follow him. But let's make sure
[3625.98s -> 3633.26s]  he doesn't see us. Really. Following yogis isn't my idea of godly behavior. Don't follow me.
[3647.24s -> 3653.79s]  I ain't following you. Don't worry. This is just one of those awkward moments where we both say
[3653.79s -> 3659.71s]  bye. We both hug. We both say our goodbyes and then we both realize fuck we're both going the same way.
[3659.71s -> 3662.35s]  We're both gonna walk down the same street for like another 10 minutes.
[3662.51s -> 3668.25s]  See you later again. I guess. We already talked about everything. We already said bye. So we don't
[3668.25s -> 3675.77s]  talk. It's just fucking weird. I hate this. What's he doing? I wish I had. I wish I had my friend.
[3675.77s -> 3700.35s]  Where's my friend? Where's the. Where's. What's his name? Murius. I wish Murius was here. Don't you?
[3701.15s -> 3718.40s]  I don't know that name. So what do I. What do I get for this?
[3718.40s -> 3723.68s]  Breed already. I'm doing a reverse escort quest. I'm doing an escort quest that he doesn't know
[3723.68s -> 3736.84s]  I'm on. Jerma's mom? Well like what? Like I dropped off my kid somewhere or like dropped off my kid
[3736.84s -> 3751.92s]  at the mall. And I'm gonna have fun. Yeah I'll pick you up in an hour. And then what you don't know is
[3751.92s -> 3759.74s]  your mother actually stays at the mall and like sees where you are. And then she's like oh my god.
[3759.74s -> 3766.06s]  I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
[3767.37s -> 3774.65s]  And like sees where you went. And just has the newspaper up and like looks over when you're
[3774.65s -> 3785.28s]  going into fucking like EB games or whatever the hell it is. And then she pulls up in the car where
[3785.28s -> 3802.03s]  you're supposed to meet. Wait what's that? What is this? Checkpoint. You followed me so I'm going
[3802.03s -> 3807.63s]  back home now. What? He saw us boss. We gotta try again. What do you mean he saw us? Wait what?
[3807.63s -> 3814.20s]  What? Wait did you see the- hold on. Did you see the hand? I don't understand. Hold on. He can see
[3814.20s -> 3821.08s]  me. Am I just like peering in looking at him? It's the hand? He get- if he actually sees the hand.
[3826.81s -> 3835.71s]  Oh he's just skipping. He's skipping now. He's sliding. Wait what's going on?
[3837.29s -> 3854.81s]  You followed me earlier. Please don't try it again. That is all. Isn't he down here? Uh oh.
[3857.40s -> 3865.39s]  We may have got a game crash scenario. Hold on. Let it sit here for a sec.
[3865.95s -> 3870.44s]  There we are. All right. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Stay away from him then. Jesus.
[3880.08s -> 3885.44s]  Gosh he's quick. He gave us the slip there. He's going to be back at his temple later.
[3885.44s -> 3889.04s]  What are you talking about? I'm sitting here looking at him. He's right here.
[3903.71s -> 3920.24s]  What the fuck is going on? Uh okay. Okay I think we'll come back to this. Is he walking again?
[3927.68s -> 3936.64s]  Um. You followed me earlier. Please don't try it again. That is all. Okay. I don't know what-
[3936.64s -> 3945.08s]  so is it the hand? It's got to be the hand or is it my- all right. So is it my point of view or
[3945.08s -> 3971.64s]  is it just the hand? It's the camera. You followed me. What the fuck? I- He saw us boss. We gotta try
[3971.64s -> 3978.04s]  again. Rats. I'm looking all- I'm like peering over the edge here. What's he doing over there?
[3978.04s -> 3981.64s]  I'm supposed to hide my face? How am I supposed to do that without losing him?
[3982.44s -> 3991.90s]  Should I be down here? The camera's always going to be able to see him somewhere.
[3992.80s -> 3997.55s]  Like should I- but if I go- all right here he comes again. All right there he is.
[4000.46s -> 4007.44s]  Okay it's impossible for me to hide because I imagine myself being 500 feet wide as a face.
[4008.24s -> 4031.20s]  Is he gonna move? I think it's fucked and it- no it has to start over again
[4031.20s -> 4042.92s]  because remember he has to go, oh you followed me. I'm gonna try this one more time. Yeah and it's
[4042.92s -> 4050.35s]  gonna glitch out for 30 seconds. Please don't try it again. That is all. Okay so let me get this
[4050.35s -> 4060.06s]  straight again. It's just- if I go too far away he- they- I lost him boss! But if I go too close
[4060.06s -> 4079.68s]  he can see my 500 foot wide face. Stay above him? So just like get- just float above him
[4083.47s -> 4097.34s]  like this so he can't see me. He's- he can't see me right? He can't see the hand either.
[4104.84s -> 4113.93s]  You followed me. What the- I'm huge! I'm huge! We gotta try again. Rats! You can't hide when you
[4113.93s -> 4123.55s]  are this big. If I go over here he's gonna- we're gonna lose him. You followed me earlier.
[4123.55s -> 4128.99s]  Please don't try it again. Wait copy paste that. Copy paste it. Copy paste it. Somebody just said
[4128.99s -> 4147.13s]  what in order to what? Okay stay- keep the camera behind him. So you're saying like just stay with
[4147.13s -> 4206.48s]  him and stay behind him. Oh fuck. Which way is he? How is this not more noticeable? Oh fuck. Oh fuck.
[4206.56s -> 4231.00s]  Oh fuck. Get behind the rock. Save the game? You can't save the game. There is no save game.
[4231.00s -> 4243.48s]  It's autosave or you have to go into the temple. Oh fuck! We got a checkpoint. Checkpoint. Checkpoint.
[4243.48s -> 4246.92s]  Checkpoint. Checkpoints. Checkpoint. Checkpoint. Checkpoint. Checkpoint. By the way saving the
[4246.92s -> 4251.16s]  game crashes the game on Windows 10. That's what I was told. We're fine. We got a new checkpoint
[4251.16s -> 4268.67s]  right here. You followed me earlier. Please don't try it again. That is all. Have you tested that
[4268.67s -> 4274.59s]  once? No I just believed what one person with negative two points on Reddit said. You followed
[4274.59s -> 4278.59s]  me so I'm going back home now. What the fuck? I didn't even start. I just had a cut scene.
[4278.59s -> 4298.20s]  We gotta try again. Rats. You followed me earlier. Yes I did. Please don't try it again. All right.
[4298.20s -> 4302.68s]  All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Here we go. I have to wrap- I have to whip
[4302.68s -> 4308.20s]  around him to the left side. You followed me so I'm going back home now. What the fuck is going-
[4308.20s -> 4318.25s]  This is ridiculous. We gotta try again. Rats. I think I can do it. I have to rip around to
[4318.25s -> 4327.02s]  the other side of the building. Oh my god. Game break. You followed me earlier. Please don't try
[4327.02s -> 4338.80s]  it again. I have to go. I'm just ripping away. Gosh he's quick. He gave us the slip there. He's
[4338.80s -> 4354.12s]  bound to be back at his temple. You followed me earlier. Please don't try it again. That is all.
[4354.20s -> 4365.47s]  Hold on. If I pull back a little bit behind the rock, I just have to zoom out. Here we go. Don't-
[4365.47s -> 4381.08s]  Jesus. Okay here we go. He's quick. He gave us the slip there. He's bound to be back at his temple.
[4381.08s -> 4393.24s]  I was coming in. What the- Why are we doing this? I don't know. This probably- I don't know. I don't
[4393.24s -> 4397.80s]  know. Please don't try it again. That is all. Just kill him. No we're so close. This is the
[4397.80s -> 4409.28s]  second checkpoint. There's probably one more mushroom turn and that's it. Okay but look at the-
[4409.28s -> 4421.37s]  This is so odd. Is he done? Start walking. Okay I have to rip the camera around.
[4422.41s -> 4438.17s]  In fact, let's go over here. You followed me so I'm going home now. Liar. Liar. You can't see me.
[4438.17s -> 4444.73s]  Oh we gotta try again. Liar. Rats. Liar. Liar. I'm under- What? Do you see my hair?
[4454.27s -> 4466.20s]  You followed me earlier. Please don't try it. That is all. Okay. You followed me so I'm going
[4466.20s -> 4471.72s]  back home now. I can't do this anymore. I can't do this anymore. I can't do it anymore. I can't
[4471.72s -> 4476.92s]  do it anymore. I can't do it anymore. It's so finicky. It's so weird. It's so glitchy and sloppy.
[4476.92s -> 4486.28s]  I can't do it. I- I- I- I'm so close. You follow- Please don't. That is all. Okay. Zoom the fuck
[4486.28s -> 4496.19s]  out quick and then come back in. And then the camera has to be behind him. So I have to rip
[4496.19s -> 4502.89s]  the camera around his left side. I have to. Jesus, man. Even the tiny little- Is he going?
[4504.12s -> 4525.58s]  He's going. Please quick. He gave us the slip there. Oh it's- You don't- This is so fucked up.
[4528.20s -> 4533.96s]  You follow- Please don't. That is all. Why did I zoom in? I didn't. I moved the camera to the left
[4533.96s -> 4541.48s]  and this terrain. So you go- Up. Up. Up. I'm right on terrain. Please quick. He gave us the slip there.
[4541.48s -> 4553.39s]  He's bound to be back at his temple later. What about- I did directly above. Directly above doesn't
[4553.39s -> 4557.87s]  do anything. He sees you. You have to be directly behind him. But to be directly- You- I'm- This is
[4557.87s -> 4566.72s]  like an RTS camera that I have to stick up this guy's fucking- I'm controlling an RTS camera.
[4568.12s -> 4594.00s]  It's not like I can- I'm walking behind of a third person. Please quick. I- This- This- Oh my god.
[4594.80s -> 4606.01s]  You can't. You can't. There's a wall in the way and the camera hits the wall and points down.
[4606.01s -> 4610.65s]  Please don't try it again. That is all. Zoom. I'm gonna- If I zoom out, it's gonna lose him.
[4610.65s -> 4621.36s]  If I- If I go across- It's gonna lose him. Stay below the ridge? I just did that shit and he saw me.
[4630.91s -> 4635.55s]  Go lower than that. Watch this. Alright, fine. Let's go lower than that.
[4637.07s -> 4647.72s]  Oh gosh. He's- He's quick, isn't he? You followed me so I'm going back home.
[4647.80s -> 4656.54s]  Alright. All the chat detectives. All the fucking chat detectives. Go ahead. Do I- Do I get- Do I
[4656.54s -> 4667.98s]  get some- Some slack? You followed me earlier. Please- Keep you back to the cliff. I've done
[4667.98s -> 4672.38s]  that three times. And every time the camera- Because it's a fucking RTS camera. It hits the
[4672.38s -> 4699.16s]  fucking goddamn side of the wall and goes- I'm not doing that. See? I- Do you see what's happening?
[4699.88s -> 4708.84s]  I can't even move the fucking camera. Alright. What do I do now? What do I do? What do I do? What
[4708.84s -> 4714.73s]  do I do? Which way? You followed me so I'm going back home now. Come on! What the fuck?
[4714.73s -> 4726.92s]  He saw us, boss. We gotta try again. What? Dude, no way. No way, man. Like, no way.
[4728.14s -> 4736.30s]  Rotate quicker? Alright. Let's give me a break. You followed me. Please, that is all.
[4736.94s -> 4742.56s]  I gotta save? I'm not gonna go to the temple and load the save, am I?
[4748.17s -> 4762.92s]  P to pause the game. What? I've got magical fucking Adam Sandler powers?
[4764.48s -> 4779.12s]  What? Are you shitting me? Oh my fucking god. Give me a fucking break. You gotta be kidding me.
[4801.52s -> 4821.71s]  Which way is he turning? Which way is he turning? Does he turn to his left? You followed me.
[4822.11s -> 4836.81s]  He saw us, boss. We gotta try again. He saw through the powers. Oh my god.
[4840.32s -> 4842.56s]  You followed me. Please, that is all.
[4843.77s -> 4877.82s]  Oh, Jesus Christ. This is fucking ridiculous, man. This is ridiculous. Alright, pause it.
[4888.41s -> 4893.45s]  Why would they put... If you have to go around this way, why would this mountain be here?
[4897.72s -> 4914.80s]  Do you see what's happening? You followed me so I'm going back home. He saw us, boss.
[4914.88s -> 4929.28s]  We gotta try again. Rats. My... Give me a... I'm doing this one more time and I'm throwing this
[4929.28s -> 4939.60s]  guy in the ocean. You followed me. Please, don't. That is all. It's like, honest to god,
[4939.60s -> 4946.08s]  this is way too complicated for how stupid this is. You followed me so I'm going back home now.
[4946.08s -> 4959.53s]  Kill him. Kill him. We gotta try again. Kill this guy. Rats. Kill him. You followed me earlier.
[4959.53s -> 4965.61s]  Please, don't. That is all. Wait, wait, wait. Somebody said 10 in-game years have passed?
[4968.01s -> 5001.40s]  Alright, I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna do it now. Here it comes. This fucking wall has no reason to
[5001.40s -> 5011.98s]  be here besides to make this part stupid. It's just really... If I go... I can't go any further.
[5011.98s -> 5028.43s]  He'll see me if I'm right here. He'll see me if I'm up here. He's gonna see me. It has to be down
[5028.43s -> 5044.68s]  here. No, it has to be down here. But no, it doesn't. Alright, are we ready? Are we ready?
[5045.87s -> 5059.15s]  Ready? It doesn't. It doesn't have to be down there. Doesn't have to be down there. Alright.
[5063.50s -> 5069.95s]  What if I lose him though? What if I lose him? Why do I have carrot hands? I don't know what that
[5069.95s -> 5076.68s]  means. Carrot hands? Alright, am I in the... Zoom in for a second. Alright, I'm good. Back here.
[5077.48s -> 5093.08s]  This is good. Guys, guys, guys. He was looking this way. He was this way. He was fucking looking
[5093.08s -> 5107.71s]  over here and I'm standing over here like this. Stay low to the ground. Get up higher. Stay low
[5107.71s -> 5111.79s]  to the ground. Eat those berries. Shove those berries up your ass. Smell the berries.
[5123.63s -> 5135.77s]  Get the milk. Eat the milk. Drink the milk. What the fuck? Too many people with too many
[5135.77s -> 5146.86s]  conflicting opinions. I'm trying. Oh my god. Damn it. This is gonna drive me crazy, man.
[5147.82s -> 5180.76s]  Murius is being tortured right now. I know. It's terrible. It's terrible. I know. Don't look at me.
[5180.76s -> 5188.65s]  Oh, is he looking at me? You have to be. He's got like a 500 degree radius of an angle to see.
[5189.85s -> 5240.41s]  Can he see? Is he gonna see me right here? Read chat. Reach. Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma,
[5240.41s -> 5244.41s]  look at the chat. Look at when the when the yogi reaches a patch of tall blue mushrooms.
[5244.41s -> 5251.64s]  Swiftly circle around to the left. Wait, what? The yogi will look around. Hold on. It's going
[5251.64s -> 5260.64s]  too fast. I can't see. Okay, this is directing the wiki. Patch of tall blue mushrooms. Swiftly,
[5260.64s -> 5263.92s]  swiftly circle around to the left towards the center of the mountain. The yogi will look around
[5263.92s -> 5267.68s]  twice before starting to walk again. You need to rotate back to your original position before he
[5267.68s -> 5272.00s]  starts walking. Time your move carefully so you start rotating. I did that. No, this is too broken
[5272.00s -> 5280.08s]  to do that. I'm already here. You followed me, so I'm going back home now. He saw us, boss.
[5280.16s -> 5286.32s]  We gotta try again. Okay, I'm beginning to believe that this is absolute horseshit. I am
[5287.36s -> 5298.35s]  directly behind him. I am directly behind him and he turns around 180 fucking degrees.
[5298.35s -> 5321.10s]  You followed me. So you want me to go like this. Up here and go. Going against everything that
[5321.10s -> 5330.27s]  everybody in this chat has screamed at me not to do. This is gonna be fucking impossible.
[5335.16s -> 5350.89s]  Why does it have to be like this? Just do it with pause spam. Zoom all the way into his back.
[5353.93s -> 5362.51s]  He's gonna see me. Just leave him alone. People are dying. People are suffering in my village.
[5363.55s -> 5373.24s]  Pause the game. I'm gonna try it. I'm gonna get right behind him and you say around to the left
[5373.24s -> 5401.36s]  and then around to the right. Fucking RTS camera, man. I swear to god. Okay, here we go. I can't go
[5401.36s -> 5439.69s]  down any further than this. I can't. I can't go down any further. Closer. Get so close. Get close,
[5439.69s -> 5458.44s]  close, close, close, closer, closer, closer. I shouldn't be this close. His body needs to
[5458.44s -> 5497.12s]  fill the screen. Crush him. Crush him. Hit him on the head with a carrot. The camera's fucking with
[5497.12s -> 5532.78s]  me here. I need to be able to see him. Okay. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Stop. Don't move. This is hurting me.
[5534.30s -> 5548.06s]  Swifter. The second I see his shoulder turn, I gotta move. Close, close, closer, closer. Don't
[5548.06s -> 5551.58s]  lose him. Closer. What are you talking about? Leave me alone. This is too stressful for you.
[5552.22s -> 5589.16s]  What? Here he goes. Is this correct? Is this correct? No. What do you mean no? Behind him.
[5589.24s -> 5612.24s]  This is, okay, this is, this is as behind a person you could possibly be behind. Don't fucking do
[5612.24s -> 5651.47s]  that. What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? So it's a, so the encounter is just broken,
[5651.47s -> 5659.13s]  is what we're saying. It's a broken ass encounter? You followed me earlier. Please don't, that is all.
[5659.61s -> 5666.65s]  So he's getting bald. I, this is ridiculous. He's gonna check twice. That wasn't even checking
[5666.65s -> 5686.44s]  twice. That was him just fucking standing there. I was, I'm about to give up on this shit. Watch
[5686.44s -> 5694.68s]  a YouTube tutorial. This is the kind of shit that you have save states every half second.
[5717.48s -> 5732.89s]  Oh my god. This camera is gonna make me die. Like, I'm done. I'm done after this. If I don't do this
[5733.21s -> 5737.45s]  I ain't doing this. Oh well, I'll drop a rock on this guy's house. I don't care.
[5738.41s -> 5760.24s]  This is stupid. So I'm going back home now. This guy's hand is in front of the guy. This
[5760.24s -> 5766.12s]  guy's hand is in front of him. These are the wrong mushrooms. Wrong mushrooms. Not even the
[5766.12s -> 5774.12s]  right mushrooms. Okay, hold on. The, hold on. The title of this video is following the yogi
[5774.12s -> 5778.68s]  and the description is annoying little shit ruined hours of my childhood.
[5778.68s -> 5807.02s]  What? This is not even the right mushrooms. Is it? Were those the right mushrooms? That's
[5807.02s -> 5812.54s]  that's wrong. Dude, he's putting his hand in front of this guy. If I did. No, that is the right
[5812.54s -> 5819.32s]  mushrooms. Hold on. How did he do this shit? I fucking did this. I swear to god. I did this shit.
[5819.32s -> 5824.56s]  I did this. We're gonna watch this video on stream because I did this shit and you all know it.
[5832.41s -> 5844.72s]  Watch this with me. I did this. I got spotted from a fucking mile away when I did this.
[5851.66s -> 5867.74s]  I, I did. He saw us, boys. We're gonna try again. So you go up here and like hide up here and like
[5867.74s -> 5874.22s]  go like this, like this and like this. I don't know, man. It's, I think my game's broken.
[5877.26s -> 5887.58s]  Because he's putting his hand in front of his face. You fuck. You fuck. You fuck. What?
[5888.38s -> 5900.94s]  What's going on? What's going on? What? What? What? What? What? What? Oh, all right. I'm gonna try
[5900.94s -> 5907.72s]  this thing where you looks like you go up above him kind of. Hold on. Pause the game. This camera
[5907.72s -> 5929.90s]  is fucked up. So I gotta get up above there. These are not the same mushrooms from the video.
[5933.05s -> 5943.05s]  What? What are you talking about? Yes, they are. Okay. All right. What does he do? What does the
[5943.05s -> 5953.47s]  guy in the video do? All right. In the video, the guy is standing right here like this. I'm
[5953.47s -> 5956.51s]  gonna go to the, I'm gonna go to the exact, I'm gonna fucking put the video on screen
[5957.15s -> 6000.32s]  and I'm gonna pause it and I'm gonna do it frame by frame, frame by frame. Hold on. Okay. So let's
[6000.32s -> 6009.21s]  get to the starting point when he gets, where is it? Right here. Okay. So there he is. He's walking
[6009.29s -> 6015.88s]  up. I guess this is an HD. So he gets it. I want to see where he is. Okay. Right. Okay. Right there.
[6020.38s -> 6031.69s]  Not close. All right. Let's go. I gotta go over here. I need to put this on my, on my stream
[6031.69s -> 6040.96s]  deck. Hold on. Cause it'll be easy to switch back and forth. Lower my resolution. No, no,
[6040.96s -> 6059.63s]  I'm not doing that. I play in HD. Let me just get this on my stream deck. Okay. There it is. So.
[6059.63s -> 6072.40s]  Oh, pause, pause it, pause it, pause it, pause it. Okay. I can't see. I can't see what he's doing.
[6073.04s -> 6110.84s]  Am I in the right spot? Kind of to the left, right? Not left. I it's, I'm trying to look at
[6110.84s -> 6134.91s]  two different screens. Why is it game different? That's pretty close. Okay. What does he do next?
[6135.55s -> 6145.40s]  Jeremy, this is not content. This is not, I'm trying, this is not supposed to be.
[6145.40s -> 6150.76s]  This is me trying to beat this, this stupid fucking childhood ruining dumb part of the game.
[6153.93s -> 6163.28s]  I don't, I'm trying to win. What happens next? Okay. What does he do when he turns?
[6167.50s -> 6171.10s]  I can't, I can't even fucking see what's going on. All right. So as he stays here,
[6171.74s -> 6179.82s]  he then lowers the camera down to, okay. I see where that is. Wait, can you guys see this?
[6181.64s -> 6186.12s]  He lowers the camera down and he start. Okay. So he lowers. Do you see what happened?
[6186.92s -> 6200.97s]  He low. Wait, why are you not getting this? Oh, I'm an idiot. I'm playing it in the other window,
[6200.97s -> 6204.57s]  not the one that's the browser source. Okay. So what does he go from here?
[6205.45s -> 6223.96s]  Plus the singing HD. Okay. So where does he move from here? So he dips down, right? Okay. He dips
[6223.96s -> 6231.39s]  down. He's about to turn. So he's, he's, he's about to turn right there. Okay. Do you see what that
[6231.39s -> 6258.44s]  is? I'm going to get it in the exact fucking spot. Is that good? It's like right there,
[6259.24s -> 6281.15s]  a little bit more to the left. It's almost indecipherable. Okay. It's tilted up a little
[6281.15s -> 6304.12s]  and back. Yeah, it is. It's like this. I gotta be like tilted down and then this way. Okay. Like
[6304.12s -> 6311.10s]  that. Okay. You can't tell me that that's almost fucking a hundred percent the same image. That's
[6311.10s -> 6332.17s]  the same image. Okay. So now what does he do from here? Okay. Right when he turns, he dips down to
[6332.17s -> 6346.28s]  there. Let's look at it one more time. There's the turn. He has now turned what he's now 100%
[6346.28s -> 6353.32s]  turned. And then he dips down to there, covering himself and that top part of that tree right there.
[6356.94s -> 6369.84s]  Okay. Here we go. This is important. So let me just, let me, so pause, pause. Oh,
[6371.44s -> 6376.56s]  the game on pause guys, the game unpaused when I clicked back over on the screen,
[6377.28s -> 6382.72s]  I wasn't ready for that. When I see escape, when I went to continue, it was paused.
[6386.40s -> 6393.58s]  When I hit continue, the game unpauses itself. It was paused. Pause. Okay. Continue. Games unpaused.
[6393.58s -> 6403.80s]  Fuck. I know what. Oh, you followed me. Please don't try it again. That is all I have.
[6404.36s -> 6421.05s]  Yeah, I did. Oh my fucking God. This is stupid. This is the stupidest thing ever.
[6421.69s -> 6434.57s]  This video only has a thousand views, but I know a thousand of us that have seen this video are like,
[6434.57s -> 6445.24s]  yeah, fuck this guy and fuck this part of the game. Fuck this guy. But I'm 1089 of people that
[6445.24s -> 6451.20s]  clicked on that video and said, yeah, holy shit, this guy sucks. It's a thousand of us strong.
[6451.76s -> 6467.58s]  What's the context? You have to follow a guy with an RTS camera and he has like a
[6467.58s -> 6475.36s]  7,000 degree viewing angle. And God damn it. Game unpauses itself after I had escaped.
[6476.44s -> 6484.76s]  Is this correct? What? Don't do, I have to, okay, I have to like change windows. Do not hit escape.
[6484.76s -> 6497.34s]  Just only change window. This is the last time I'm doing this. That's it. That's close. That's
[6497.34s -> 6532.83s]  pretty close. Okay. Increase your FOV. I can't fucking believe I'm still doing this shit.
[6533.63s -> 6542.65s]  Okay. All right. Why does this game have to be so finicky? If you don't finish this,
[6546.70s -> 6550.94s]  I'm not doing like a routine here, guys. Look at the fucking description of this video.
[6552.73s -> 6556.65s]  Annoying little shit ruins hours of my childhood. I didn't make this video.
[6557.61s -> 6589.56s]  Okay. This is it. It's going to be a little bit further like this. Okay. That's close enough.
[6589.56s -> 6594.12s]  Seriously. That is as close as I'm going to get it for like a fifth thousandth fucking time doing
[6594.12s -> 6612.97s]  this shit. Okay. He wraps around. I'm done after this. I have to stop it. When he, when he gets,
[6612.97s -> 6628.09s]  I have to grab here. And when he turns, spin around. It's after he turns. There it is. The
[6628.17s -> 6642.56s]  camera has to be literally right here. Remember that tree further? Yeah. It's where's the tree
[6642.56s -> 6654.89s]  in our, we have to hold on. Okay. He comes back up and this way. Fuck man. I feel like that's,
[6654.89s -> 6661.74s]  this is not going to work. I don't think this is going to work. He comes out of there and is
[6661.74s -> 6684.49s]  sitting here and then he just stays behind him. So, so at this point he, when he starts walking,
[6684.49s -> 6690.99s]  so he begins his walk. I got to come out. Okay. So I have to come back out and up and then get
[6690.99s -> 6698.78s]  a little bit closer and keep tilting. Oh, fuck me, man. Okay. He hasn't started really. Okay.
[6698.78s -> 6718.81s]  He started walking now and then where is he? He started walking. All right. So he, he started
[6718.81s -> 6756.43s]  his walk. All right. Fuck. Hold on. Hold on. I got to zoom out a little here. Get the fuck out.
[6756.43s -> 6762.64s]  All right. Am I, is it ready to meet? Can I come out? Can I come out? Can I come out?
[6764.73s -> 6768.33s]  I think I can, I can come out now, right? This is what happens in the video, doesn't it?
[6773.95s -> 6783.45s]  Yes. Is this, am I, am I safe right here? Is this correct? This is correct, right? Yeah.
[6784.09s -> 6815.18s]  I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. I did it. All right. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[6815.18s -> 6836.41s]  Wait, what does he do? What? What do you mean refresh the page? What? Black and white following
[6836.41s -> 6851.61s]  the yogi and it says annoying little shit. Wait, hold on. Read the description again.
[6851.61s -> 6869.05s]  Jerma sucks. What? How did, are you watching the stream? Annoying little shit. Runaway. Jerma
[6869.05s -> 6895.85s]  sucks by the way. Hold on. I want to get lovely. This is fucking lovely. Oh, lovely. Yeah. Lovely.
[6895.85s -> 6910.60s]  I'm so happy about this. Hold on. Oh no. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[6910.84s -> 6914.60s]  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm doing that yet. I'm doing that. Yeah. I just broke the whole game.
[6915.40s -> 6918.36s]  I don't care. I don't care. I was going to, I was going to show all the comments.
[6918.36s -> 6933.77s]  Everyone's being real nice. All right. Pa, unpause. Does he, does he turn around again? Is this the
[6933.77s -> 6944.54s]  end or does he turn around again? Save the game. I can't, it might crash. Okay. Let me just check
[6944.54s -> 6972.72s]  the video. Check the video. Check the video. Delete the video before he can beat it. Delete
[6972.72s -> 6980.24s]  the video. Shut up. Do not even think about it. Don't delete this video. Don't delete this video.
[6980.24s -> 6992.78s]  I need it. I need this video. Do not delete this video. It doesn't matter if he deletes it. I still
[6992.78s -> 7002.11s]  have it in my queue. All right. Then he goes, he doesn't turn around again. You just have to stay
[7002.11s -> 7012.78s]  behind him. There is more. How much more is there? Why is there more? There can't be more.
[7013.74s -> 7036.67s]  No, I don't want to do more. Oh my God. Is there a checkpoint here? Is there a checkpoint?
[7037.39s -> 7065.18s]  Fuck. But he goes, where does he go? Save the game. If I save the game in a crash,
[7065.18s -> 7069.68s]  I'm going to be fucking really mad. All right. That's the end. All right. If I save the game,
[7069.68s -> 7076.89s]  the game crashes. I'm going to fucking be, I'm going to explode. Control S. If I do this,
[7077.85s -> 7087.31s]  Control S. Don't. Do not. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do
[7087.31s -> 7114.48s]  it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Do it. Don't do it. Should I do
[7114.48s -> 7132.73s]  it? Don't. So many people are saying no. That's too risky. What if I exit the game right now?
[7134.59s -> 7151.72s]  Okay. If I exit the game right now, it's going to say no. Just stay behind him. All right. What
[7151.80s -> 7159.32s]  does he come out from out there? Control S. Fuck. I am so, now get over, it's over here, right?
[7160.04s -> 7162.68s]  Not yet. I don't know. This is fucking horrible. I don't know what to do.
[7170.40s -> 7179.77s]  Just carry him laughing my ass off. On top of the rock. What happened in the video? I hope you
[7179.77s -> 7204.99s]  didn't delete it. He's not deleted. He didn't delete it. He goes under the rock and then as
[7204.99s -> 7213.15s]  he goes underneath when he, he's, he's underneath mine completely. All right. He's under the rock.
[7213.15s -> 7219.34s]  You just stay above the rock and let him come out. Wait up here until, again, when he comes out,
[7220.14s -> 7237.56s]  you start to move towards him. Okay. I'll get there. Let's do that on mine. Where is he?
[7244.04s -> 7258.57s]  Okay. And then now he's almost the top of that little hill. Okay. He's at the top of that little
[7258.57s -> 7266.56s]  hill. Okay. Now what does he do? Now what happens? He's at the top of the hill. Is he at the top of
[7266.56s -> 7274.76s]  the hill on this one too? Now what? He bent. Okay. He, I see that little pit. See that. What
[7274.76s -> 7291.12s]  happened? He starts to turn this way and he stays, he stays right here. He stays in this general area
[7291.12s -> 7328.01s]  right here. So he stays like here, like this, like that, right? Closer, like right there. Okay.
[7331.84s -> 7360.60s]  And then just please don't see me. Right. Just stay here. Right. I, I, okay. When he starts,
[7360.60s -> 7363.00s]  what does that happen? When he starts to move, when he starts moving, where do I go?
[7363.64s -> 7379.12s]  What's wrong? I thought he deleted it. I'm so fucking glad you're not going to delete it.
[7379.12s -> 7392.14s]  Must resurg, resist urge to delete video. Okay. He looks, he looks, he looks, you go around the
[7392.14s -> 7403.53s]  tree. You go around to the right behind the tree. Okay. Got it. So you go around this way
[7403.53s -> 7447.23s]  behind the tree. Yes. Oh fuck. Oh, that was horrible. Your stealth surprised me. You know
[7447.23s -> 7453.23s]  the secret of my special place of meditation. If you will remain quiet, I will help you on this
[7453.23s -> 7463.39s]  land. Oh, that was horrible. Rest assured I'll appear when needed. That is all. So what? What
[7463.39s -> 7475.34s]  did that do for me? Now kill him. I'll appear as needed. I don't get anything for that.
[7482.62s -> 7492.60s]  I did it. Somebody said the description changed again. Read the comments. All right. I'm going
[7492.60s -> 7498.12s]  to go through the comments of this, uh, video. Sure. Uh, German sucks by the way. Let's see.
[7498.12s -> 7503.34s]  Let's read it. Uh, short streamer. Jeremy Albertson needs guides to finish boomer game more at 10.
[7503.34s -> 7507.66s]  This is like this guy ruined hours of this person's childhood. A thousand of us get it.
[7507.66s -> 7512.70s]  Jeremy, you short omega low. That's funny. Five one Willem Dafoe needs tutorial to move camera
[7512.70s -> 7516.22s]  correctly. That's hysterical. Derma couldn't get it right. Now you're right. Hello, ladies and
[7516.22s -> 7520.30s]  gentlemen, welcome to the German craft copper pasta. This guy may be mauled on stream. Derma
[7520.30s -> 7524.54s]  walk. You can do a German. This is a German nine eight five partner channel. Now I was here when
[7524.54s -> 7528.70s]  he watched it. Derma Venus. Derma be like, Hmm, today we'll watch a tutorial live on stream and
[7528.70s -> 7534.14s]  not save mega milk. This is painful. Annoying streamer ruins hours of his middle age. Thank
[7534.14s -> 7538.14s]  you for this video. Jeremy would be banging his head against the wall without it. It's true.
[7539.26s -> 7543.98s]  I can't believe mega milk died for this legendary heard that some streamer called grill master,
[7543.98s -> 7548.62s]  whatever, sudden change in description left me in tears. Derma, you're handsome. Derma's handsome.
[7548.62s -> 7559.93s]  That's the same person. He did it. Let's read some of the comments from five years ago. Thank you.
[7559.93s -> 7566.08s]  This is from five years ago. I never could beat that mission. So it's great to actually see it
[7566.08s -> 7571.60s]  happen. It's kind of disappointing actually. Okay. What about another one from like 10 years ago?
[7578.96s -> 7587.28s]  That's it. That's it. That's the only comment. Liar making up comments. Go read them for yourself.
[7587.28s -> 7599.63s]  Sort by date. Let's go down to the end. Let's see. This is too many. One. Okay. A year ago,
[7599.63s -> 7605.23s]  five years ago. That's the only two comments. All right. Hype train initiated. All right.
[7605.23s -> 7611.63s]  Thanks for watching that guys. Wait, did another, another hype train, another hype train has been
[7611.63s -> 7623.02s]  initiated. Wait, what's going on? It's not doing it again, right? No. Okay. It's showing up on this
[7623.02s -> 7630.03s]  other screen. It's showing up on my Twitch dashboard now. All right. No, it's not. There's
[7630.03s -> 7638.25s]  no hype train. Don't hype anything. Okay. Welcome back to the stream guys. That was fucking stupid.
[7640.70s -> 7649.36s]  Let's uh, oh yeah. I had like a village that was starving. Let's go. How am I doing?
[7656.28s -> 7663.16s]  Oh, I'm so glad I don't have to do that anymore. That sucked. That actually was the worst. What was
[7663.16s -> 7667.32s]  I doing though? I've, that was, this was an hour ago. I don't remember what I was doing.
[7668.28s -> 7681.64s]  I was doing something important. I don't remember what that was. Breeding. Breeding. Right. Okay.
[7681.64s -> 7686.04s]  But I want some more. Oh wait. I went with my, my, the forest isn't doing anything.
[7691.87s -> 7699.79s]  You were saving Murius. I'll get this out of here. This is going to cause a problem. It's going to
[7699.79s -> 7705.40s]  hurt somebody. So to get rid of it. All right. I want to go take over the other village. That's
[7705.40s -> 7711.53s]  not going to hit a village, right? You got to be fucking kidding me. That's not going to hit the
[7711.61s -> 7716.48s]  good. Okay. All right. Let's make these people believe in me. What do you say?
[7721.04s -> 7725.84s]  Let's give them some food. They look like they need it. What's the food symbol?
[7728.99s -> 7735.56s]  I got to move in to my territory and then out to these people here that I want to give it to.
[7739.16s -> 7746.44s]  Miracle food. Let's get some influence. Ready? Uh, terrible. Come back over here.
[7748.89s -> 7753.31s]  All right. Here we go. All right. Oh, I don't have influence. I can't
[7758.72s -> 7773.16s]  damn it. Well, you need the immortal guy. What? How many believe do I need to take this over?
[7773.80s -> 7783.63s]  419. Just make a new village. You want to make a new village right down here at the edge.
[7784.43s -> 7798.12s]  Let me get this situated though. What happened here? What happened here? Wood. All right. What
[7798.12s -> 7807.93s]  we got anymore? Yeah. Let's put it. Let's make another settlement down here and it's time to
[7807.93s -> 7820.94s]  breed. Let's get some children. Did the trees grow? Um, they did not. They did not. Well,
[7827.58s -> 7847.08s]  time just to harvest them. Don't worry. We'll get them back. I can't believe I took that long
[7847.08s -> 7869.64s]  to do that. There's a miracle over here. Let's get that one. We can't believe it either. Well,
[7870.68s -> 7876.52s]  that guy is apparently important. I can't just not do anything with that guy. Physical shield.
[7886.12s -> 7894.56s]  I don't need that right now. Physical shield. All right. What if I give it to them?
[7895.20s -> 7907.04s]  Here. Oh, well, how do I cancel? Can I drop this? I don't want to. I don't want to use this.
[7908.16s -> 7920.70s]  I'm gonna sneeze. That couldn't be. I don't want this. Drop. Press you. No, you said bless you.
[7921.42s -> 7932.41s]  Who am I connected to? I don't want this. I actually don't want to shake it. There we go.
[7933.05s -> 7947.50s]  All right. It's time to breed. You. Breed. We need breeding. Breed. Disciple breeder. More.
[7947.50s -> 7964.11s]  We need children. Disciple breeder. More children. Who else? You're hurting them.
[7965.18s -> 7976.80s]  I'm not hurting anybody. I am not hurting anyone. I'm trying to get them to breed.
[7977.76s -> 7985.98s]  Disciple breeder. Disciple breeder. Thank you. Okay. Children are starting to come out. We have
[7985.98s -> 8001.96s]  enough place to live. Do need a little bit more wood, which there's some in here. And when that's
[8001.96s -> 8010.99s]  done, I gotta go this way. Which way should I go? This little area down here. Tons of trees over
[8010.99s -> 8033.64s]  here. In fact, I'm gonna harvest them. I need to. Play music for the right mood. This is kind of
[8033.80s -> 8045.16s]  the right mood. My buddy is gone. All right. Let's go. More food. Miracle food. People still
[8045.16s -> 8060.46s]  worshiping. Yeah, they are. They're getting tired though. 12,000 food. 11,000 wood. That should be
[8060.46s -> 8066.86s]  enough for now. Have some kids. Breed. And then I have to make this town. I have to influence this
[8066.86s -> 8073.66s]  town. What do you think? Maybe another little center here? Oops. I didn't want to do that.
[8081.15s -> 8086.70s]  You need a lot more breeders. I mean, I kind of, but I don't want to do too much.
[8088.14s -> 8092.06s]  What are they doing? Going home. Steve Jackson's going to sleep.
[8093.18s -> 8106.33s]  Disciple breeder. More. We need more kids. We need a worship site. Our population, seriously,
[8106.33s -> 8120.11s]  is not doing so well. Going to the forest? Is this still not built? How the fuck is this not
[8120.11s -> 8136.44s]  built? Everyone's like 70 plus years old. Better start having kids. Okay. Build two more houses.
[8136.44s -> 8144.41s]  We can live in these damn things. You were gone for 10 years. Yeah. Well, I had to figure out
[8144.41s -> 8157.40s]  some things. Build it. Are there, what about the, okay, let's go to the temple. This is about
[8157.40s -> 8178.24s]  eight women up here. I think so. Are there? Okay. We need some breeding. Breed. 76 years old.
[8179.12s -> 8197.10s]  I'm going to have my first child at 80. Can I? Disciple breeder. Okay. Good. We have to have
[8197.10s -> 8210.49s]  kids. Start having kids before the whole village gets wiped out. 68, 85. All right. Well, let's
[8210.49s -> 8225.95s]  just, wait, I think that was, I think that was a female. Fuck. How old was she? I just like,
[8225.95s -> 8232.83s]  oh God. Okay. Come here. Disciple breeder. What am I doing? I'm trying to make kids. Everybody's 80
[8232.83s -> 8243.32s]  and everyone's going to die. Did you even read chat? What are you talking about? What are you
[8243.32s -> 8253.42s]  talking about? The average age of people in this village is 75 years old. I have to make kids.
[8255.63s -> 8261.29s]  Use a pregnancy miracle. I don't have that. You're talking about stuff that's potentially like
[8261.93s -> 8263.13s]  six levels into the game.
[8275.31s -> 8287.21s]  All these kids are going to be messed up. Why are they having kids? All right. Get in the temple.
[8287.21s -> 8310.48s]  I need to see what's going on here. I need a better picture. Oh, 73% male. There are
[8310.48s -> 8327.39s]  222 people. More than an insane majority of men. Breeders. This is bad. Okay. What does my,
[8328.35s -> 8340.91s]  what's my creature have to say? I'm greedy. I'm tired. I think my God's on the good side.
[8340.91s -> 8350.65s]  I want to think about the creature Chugworth. He is totally evil. Who is Chugworth? The guy
[8350.65s -> 8364.03s]  torturing him? This guy torturing me is totally evil. Chugworth is such a cool name.
[8365.32s -> 8369.58s]  What's Murius? Murius is a good name too. Let's take a look at this.
[8370.30s -> 8381.93s]  All right. I got to start influencing because I wish I just had my guy. You know what I mean?
[8381.93s -> 8387.26s]  If I had my guy, I'd be fine, but I don't. All right. Get me out of here.
[8391.74s -> 8404.94s]  This is the room where you. Well, you could influence it or you could follow a Yogi for 60
[8404.94s -> 8412.14s]  years, but that's, that's probably going to come back to be a good thing. I would assume it has to
[8412.14s -> 8421.10s]  be right. All right. Time to build. I need wood. I need to build like a, what should I build?
[8421.10s -> 8431.05s]  Like a new town center down there. What do you think? What should I put down there to put my,
[8431.05s -> 8449.00s]  to put some influence? Almost out of wood. There's no kids either. I have to, all right,
[8449.00s -> 8465.16s]  I got to use the actor. Where is he? Come here. Look at what I have. Interesting, huh?
[8468.49s -> 8497.26s]  It's cool. I know I'm shaking a guy around in front of you. You didn't kill me. Oops.
[8500.41s -> 8508.32s]  Please don't throw me. Oh, cast some miracles in here while he's running around. Good idea.
[8508.32s -> 8514.49s]  All right. Let's do a food. Let's give him food. Oh, you big boy. Try it again. And you're
[8515.05s -> 8531.23s]  dead. Food. Yeah. Food in here. Look. Please don't throw me my leg. You want more food?
[8532.83s -> 8540.20s]  There's much more where that came from. Oh, you big bully. Try it again. And you're dead. Look
[8540.20s -> 8551.92s]  what I got. Look at that. Huh? Cool. Huh? Want some more? I need 300 belief. Please don't throw me
[8552.64s -> 8568.35s]  on my arm. I got more miracles. I've got more miracles. Get off me. Oh, my head. Throw some
[8568.35s -> 8576.80s]  fireballs around. No, no, no. I need influence, not fear. I do not. I want influence. I do not
[8576.80s -> 8597.29s]  want fear. Oh, oh, you big bully. Try it again. And you're dead. Wow. 280 belief. Come on. Let me,
[8597.29s -> 8604.40s]  let me, like, look, I pick up a tree and like do this. It's crazy, huh? Look at this. Look at
[8604.40s -> 8612.84s]  that shit. Cool, huh? Leave it. I'm not worth it. Miracle food. I'm trying to grab him. Please
[8612.84s -> 8623.74s]  don't throw me my leg. He's not worth it. He is because he lets me interact with this town.
[8628.84s -> 8643.29s]  You didn't kill me. All right. How much did I get for that? 251. I think I have to kill somebody.
[8644.01s -> 8659.08s]  Where'd he go? Please don't please don't throw me. I'm gonna hit somebody with this. Eventually.
[8659.08s -> 8667.64s]  Oh, my eye. That's a new line. Put him on the sacrificial altar. Hold on. Oh, you big bully.
[8667.64s -> 8672.68s]  Put one of your guys in the village. Get off me. Oh, you big bully. All right. Well, I have to put.
[8672.68s -> 8687.16s]  All right. Here we go. Who am I putting in there? Um, you. Somebody from my village. Oh, you big
[8687.16s -> 8694.59s]  bully. Try it again and you're dead. What did I just do? Did I just make him? No, no, no, no. Don't.
[8694.59s -> 8711.92s]  I want to. What does that mean? Is he like a. Did they just capture him? Did I make him into wood?
[8711.92s -> 8718.16s]  No, I didn't. Look, he's like talking. I think he just. Did he just breed? Who? Wait, where is he?
[8718.88s -> 8747.40s]  Is that them? Oh, it is. He's going around. He's. He's breeding. Right? Yeah. I infected them. Where's
[8747.40s -> 8761.21s]  he going? All right. I still need. Let me go back to my town. I have a lot of food. OK, let's build.
[8761.21s -> 8769.12s]  What do I want? There's a fucking shitload of food. OK, bigger house, civic building.
[8769.92s -> 8778.83s]  What should I do? Should I do a new village center or should I just do another place to live?
[8781.16s -> 8788.75s]  The soccer field is broken and it does not work, apparently. Make a graveyard. Change him to a
[8788.75s -> 8824.11s]  missionary. Hold on. Where's my guy that I throw for it to be able to interact? My head. OK, we're
[8824.11s -> 8832.75s]  in. We're in. You didn't kill me. Get off. Get off me. So where did my. Where did my guy go?
[8832.75s -> 8840.49s]  Is he just in here breeding in the village still? All right, I'm going to make a missionary.
[8841.21s -> 8854.70s]  I can't. I have no access to the snow. There he is. Wait, what are you doing? Try it again and
[8854.70s -> 8859.13s]  you're dead. I don't have enough influence over there. You've got to stay over here.
[8864.70s -> 8871.98s]  So this is weird. I don't think this is the kind of dumb way to do this. Oh, my head is built down
[8871.98s -> 8877.21s]  here because I can't put him over there unless I have access to be over here, which I don't have
[8877.21s -> 8885.00s]  access to be over here. Oh, you big bully. Try it again and please don't throw me like this guy has
[8885.00s -> 8893.39s]  to be standing in this village. My leg. OK, I have to grab somebody and put him in here
[8897.79s -> 8906.09s]  because I cannot do anything in this town unless there's positive. I'm cheating the system right
[8906.09s -> 8914.30s]  now. Essentially, it was what's happening. All right. You, Jeff Keighley, Jeff Keighley,
[8914.30s -> 8921.50s]  you are now going to be a missionary. What does it look like over here on the temple
[8922.30s -> 8940.65s]  on their temple? They don't have one, do they? On top of a person. Does it have to be a person
[8941.29s -> 8959.53s]  because the breeding is next to a house? OK, God damn it. Please don't. This guy has to be
[8959.53s -> 8980.56s]  over here. What the fuck? OK. Oh, you big bully. Try it again and you're dead. OK, Jeff Keighley,
[8980.56s -> 8995.88s]  come here. So was that like Zen symbol? Correct. Could I do it here? Disciple missionary. There he
[8995.88s -> 9014.76s]  is. He's going to change. What's going on in here? All right. Jeff Keighley is now. He's a
[9014.76s -> 9024.35s]  missionary. OK, I still need 226 believe flying, flying, flying. What happened? What did you guys
[9024.35s -> 9040.12s]  do? I died. What did they do? I can't even help them. Jesus. All right. All right. I got a
[9040.12s -> 9045.16s]  missionary. I got to go back to my town. I'm going to build something down here. I can take
[9045.16s -> 9060.08s]  anything. How are we doing on kids? Very important. Fuck. Somebody else died. Do we even have any
[9060.08s -> 9082.16s]  children? Aren't these any kids? Is it no kids? I got to get some breeding done now. You need
[9082.16s -> 9097.39s]  women have to be 45 or under to breed. Well, this town's gone. Hopefully Jeff Keighley does
[9097.39s -> 9108.78s]  something over there. Otherwise, this is actually fucking ruined. Everybody's 80. Oh no, it's over.
[9111.16s -> 9122.12s]  Steal people from the other village. Everyone over here is fucking ancient too.
[9122.92s -> 9132.73s]  Everybody look at how old everybody is. 60, 50, 60, 60, 70, 70, 70. Why are we so old? 20. OK,
[9132.73s -> 9144.30s]  hold on. Give me a break. Come on. This dude's going to die of old age. I got to get him. Oh,
[9144.30s -> 9156.97s]  that sucks. I spent 60 years following the stupid guy on the cliff. Oh, help. Oh, God.
[9167.07s -> 9180.17s]  No, you didn't kill me. Please don't throw me. Where the fuck am I? Speaking of missionaries,
[9180.17s -> 9185.77s]  time to go find some people to bring back to my town. And I don't know, I guess.
[9185.77s -> 9201.40s]  You didn't get off. Get off me. 84. Who are you? Oh, you big bully. Try it again.
[9201.40s -> 9209.10s]  I don't know who this person is. OK, got you. You are on my team now. You live here now.

[9441.71s -> 9457.93s]  mean to do that. 22. Come here. OK. These are two. These are women. All right. Women, women, women.
[9458.01s -> 9478.52s]  Where's the other guy? There he is. Put that down. All right. Did you do it? They're both going into
[9478.52s -> 9507.26s]  the same hut to give birth. Oh, this is weird. Oh, kids, kids. Come here. More. Where are those
[9507.26s -> 9516.88s]  kids? Where are they? I don't see any. Oh, this hole. Everybody's going to be related.
[9521.15s -> 9523.07s]  Everybody's going to be related.
[9529.48s -> 9544.09s]  Oh, no. Oh, boy. Here we go. No. Where are they? We need kids. Oh, they don't have any babies.
[9544.89s -> 9569.74s]  I need to steal more people. No. I have to do it before this guy dies. It takes a minute to give
[9569.74s -> 9601.45s]  birth. OK. Let's get another. You didn't kill me. 46, 85, 23. This place is vacant. What's wrong with
[9601.45s -> 9626.56s]  it? It doesn't need to be repaired. What are you talking about? OK. Now you breed. Disciple breeder.

[9774.28s -> 9784.11s]  24. Convert the village. I mean, I can't unless I can. I can't get over there for long enough.
[9784.75s -> 9794.04s]  I think it's going to be fine. Everybody over here is going to be a breeder.

[9848.17s -> 9853.77s]  everybody is now breeding with each other. Remember, the old can also breed.
[9853.77s -> 9863.53s]  I thought you guys don't know they couldn't. Disciple Breeder.
[9866.81s -> 9880.17s]  I'm trying to make offspring. One guy killed the colony.
[9882.97s -> 9889.05s]  Yeah, because I had to follow around this dude, which, by the way, if I was supposed to follow
[9889.05s -> 9900.46s]  that person around, that takes 10, 20, 30 years. Well, going home, going home, giving birth. OK.
[9900.46s -> 9906.35s]  We got another baby. I think we're going to be in the clear for a while. You don't go to the forest
[9906.35s -> 9926.17s]  for wood. Only breed. No one do anything else but breed. Anything. Disciple Breeder. OK. Don't do
[9926.17s -> 9935.82s]  anything but have children. There we go. All right. I think they will populate themselves now.

[9957.60s -> 9965.61s]  That's pretty fucked up. That's pretty fucked up. Yeah. Yeah, it's fucked up.
[9975.37s -> 9977.61s]  Heal the villagers. They're all under 50% health.
[9977.61s -> 10018.80s]  OK. One more. Over here. Nobody's worshipping, right? No, they can't. They can't because they
[10018.80s -> 10037.12s]  need to breed. Make them have, no. Having children. Breeding. I see a lot more names. That's good.

[10050.35s -> 10053.58s]  I need to do another heal though. How do I get another heal?
[10057.15s -> 10062.01s]  65%. Someone's got to go up here. OK. Is there anybody that's over the age of 60?
[10076.03s -> 10092.88s]  All right. Who needs help? You guys down here. 90, 40, 70, 60, 70, 70. 75%. All right. That's good.
[10094.70s -> 10103.74s]  All right. Everyone's OK. We're good. Maybe I should steal some more people.

[10132.59s -> 10149.00s]  You know what I mean? Let's just trash the place until they like me. No. Don't crash. I'm not doing
[10149.00s -> 10158.12s]  that again. You didn't kill me. Please don't throw me. All right. Look what I can do, guys.
[10158.12s -> 10171.53s]  You didn't kill me. Cool, huh? Get off me. Oh, hell. I wonder if he's going to die of an old age.
[10172.33s -> 10182.91s]  There's got to be it. Come on. Like I need like 20 more. Look, the miracle of something. You didn't
[10182.91s -> 10199.24s]  kill me. 12. That's a kid. Put the kid down. All right. How much more? 32? Damn it. Where is he?

[10212.49s -> 10219.23s]  I know. Why am I throwing this person? Because it gains belief points. Oh, my eye. Oh, you big
[10219.23s -> 10229.90s]  bully. Try it. Get off. Get off me. Do you believe me now, please? No. Once I have this village,

[10325.13s -> 10334.75s]  have to throw this guy again. I have to just deposit food over here. Oh, you big bully.
[10334.75s -> 10344.16s]  Got it. Try it again and you're dead. Get off. Get off me. Oh, you big bully. Try it again and
[10344.16s -> 10373.64s]  you're dead. Oh, my fucking God. Where is he? Please don't throw me. You didn't kill me.
[10377.08s -> 10385.96s]  Please don't throw me. I don't want to hear this dude ever again. I need 20 belief. I've given them
[10385.96s -> 10394.78s]  food. I've thrown people. I've destroyed things. How do I get this? Just 20 fucking belief.
[10396.22s -> 10400.38s]  Save the cow. You didn't kill me. Please don't throw me. Do you understand the cow is across
[10400.38s -> 10428.57s]  the entire game? I can't even. I can't get over there. I have to. This is somehow taking more
[10428.57s -> 10434.84s]  time than following the yogi around. Doesn't building get you more influence? You didn't kill
[10434.84s -> 10441.08s]  me. That's what I thought too. But I look at how much. I'm going to try building one building over
[10441.08s -> 10460.64s]  here. Just give me the fucking thing. Right at the edge. Somebody build the damn thing. Build that.
[10460.72s -> 10471.15s]  Disciple builder. Because I can't do anything over here until I have sacrificed somebody for a
[10471.15s -> 10484.54s]  miracle. I God damn it, man. Look at all these children. The problem was following the yogi.
[10484.54s -> 10488.14s]  Following the yogi was the dumbest thing to ever do. It just deleted 60 years.
[10495.61s -> 10501.85s]  Walking behind. I had save points and shit. That took like 70 fucking years to walk behind that
[10501.85s -> 10517.07s]  guy slowly. I got to sacrifice somebody for a miracle. Destroy a house in the village with a
[10517.07s -> 10527.92s]  rock. I tried to throw like a tree at their wall. All right. Give me a rock. Fuck it. Let's go.
[10532.60s -> 10540.30s]  I don't even know where that went. I have no idea where that just went. I need the actor again
[10540.30s -> 10550.70s]  to do that. Oh my God. He's going to die of old age. This is so stupid.
[10551.26s -> 10559.80s]  Oh, you please don't throw me. Oh, you pick it up. You didn't kill me. Please don't throw me.
[10559.80s -> 10566.52s]  Oh, you please don't throw me. You didn't kill me. Please don't throw me. You didn't kill me.
[10566.52s -> 10573.40s]  You have a rock in your village anywhere. I need a boulder. Oh, you big bully. Try it again and
[10573.40s -> 10586.40s]  you're dead. That's it. Fuck you. Finally. Jesus God. You didn't kill me.
[10595.92s -> 10602.60s]  We almost have our cow back. All this pain.
[10615.20s -> 10626.57s]  All right. God damn it. My influence has grown. Now let's do this. Everybody. Everybody start
[10626.57s -> 10634.25s]  working together. How are we doing? We have another village over here. I have influence right there.
[10635.13s -> 10643.61s]  We need breeding now. Breathe together. Live here in peace. What's going on?
[10644.09s -> 10652.17s]  I is dead. I have your creature and you still dare to oppose me.
[10653.61s -> 10666.68s]  The cow's been frozen for 100 years. I see some of your minions have strayed. What? Behold wrath.
[10666.68s -> 10684.64s]  What? No. I can't let this happen. I don't have a water spell. I don't have a water spell.
[10687.24s -> 10694.76s]  No. There he is. Save us, please. Please. You took all of them.
[10699.00s -> 10703.24s]  That's all you're going to give me is two water miracles? Thanks for nothing.
[10703.64s -> 10746.76s]  Stop lighting each other on fire. They're reigniting each other. Okay. We good? Vagrant.
[10749.52s -> 10753.04s]  Okay. So did I just get a shitload of people? Oh my God. They're all 18.

[12433.60s -> 12441.98s]  Because this is a huge forest. Let's just do this. Look at how many trees are over here.
[12444.01s -> 12456.76s]  An insane amount. This can feed everybody. What? Am I taking the whole forest? What the hell?
[12458.11s -> 12479.61s]  It's shrinking piece by piece. Oh Jesus. Okay. Almost a 20,000. All right. Let's make a...
[12479.61s -> 12488.51s]  What do I want to make? This is the edge of my influence. I kind of need to make... Who's
[12488.51s -> 12493.31s]  going home? All right. I got to build a building up here. Maybe a house or something.
[12494.03s -> 12506.83s]  All right. Where's the production yard? Wood required. Seven wood. Disciple builder.
[12509.04s -> 12511.76s]  Bro the guy again. I'm not doing that again.
[12514.96s -> 12522.16s]  You may have your few believers, but I can still command the beasts of the wilderness.
[12522.24s -> 12531.48s]  He's sending animals to attack us. Is it a bunch of raccoons? Oh wait.
[12532.12s -> 12539.15s]  It seems you have need of me. The wolves are possessed, but I think I can help you.
[12539.71s -> 12545.64s]  I will try to destroy some of the wolves. Can you destroy them all? Okay. Did you...
[12546.68s -> 12552.89s]  Do we have any defense or anything? I need a rock. I need a rock. I need something.
[12553.77s -> 12567.21s]  Where are they? Oh fuck. I need something. Pause the game. We need worship right now
[12568.01s -> 12581.00s]  because I need like fireballs and shit. I need lightning. Everybody worship. Which
[12581.00s -> 12587.63s]  one has the lightning in it? This one does. Okay. It's time. And that's this town here.
[12588.43s -> 12593.96s]  All right everybody. I need some of you to stop what you're doing. I need like a 45%.
[12593.96s -> 12600.52s]  Everybody. Lightning. It's 98%. Kill somebody quick.
[12618.75s -> 12623.55s]  Wolves have reached the village. Stop. Let me fucking do it. Are you kidding me?
[12624.81s -> 12643.28s]  You've got to be fucking kidding me. I can't even believe that this would happen.
[12643.92s -> 12648.00s]  Like that is unbelievable that that would be in the game.
[12653.37s -> 12669.05s]  A wolf came over. They attacked with wolves. A wolf got into the town
[12669.05s -> 12687.61s]  and now I lost the entire city. What was the last save? I'm not doing that. That's bogus.
[12687.61s -> 12701.16s]  That's actually fucking bogus. That's bogus. The true meaning of that word.
[12701.88s -> 12722.94s]  Now I want to spin. Get me out of here. What a pointless room. Where's the save game room?
[12723.96s -> 12731.16s]  I can't. Oh sire. A wolf got into the capital. Every single fucking person has turned.
[12732.52s -> 12740.30s]  What time is it? Five nine. That's wait. That's like a million years ago.
[12741.58s -> 12746.91s]  No no no. Don't delete it. Just get me back. I can't fucking believe it.
[12751.95s -> 12774.19s]  252 can i leave this goddamn place i'm actually angry just retake the village
[12774.19s -> 12788.12s]  yeah i've seen another three hours how much belief does it have
[12790.81s -> 12799.12s]  what the fuck are you i am i see am i am i am i am i the corrective lenses here
[12799.12s -> 12813.37s]  to see that's 14 fucking hundred believe i'm cheating i don't care this is stupid i'm cheating
[12813.37s -> 12824.40s]  Nah, I, you know, no way. I can't, that's unbelievable.
[12824.40s -> 12841.82s]  Is there any cheats here? That took so much time to get it and it's removed in five seconds.
[12841.82s -> 12846.28s]  This is not even cheats, this is like a guide for the game.
[12846.28s -> 12857.04s]  No, do you guys remember when websites used to do this stupid shit?
[12857.04s -> 12860.04s]  And it would be, oh, cheat codes!
[12860.04s -> 12864.04s]  And they would just tell you how to get achievements in the game, or how to unlock something.
[12864.04s -> 12869.88s]  Aren't you so happy that these websites probably get zero fucking traffic now?
[12869.88s -> 12880.08s]  Like, I just went to one of these and I'm probably the first visitor in, like, four years.
[12880.08s -> 12896.30s]  God damn it. I can't fucking believe I have to, uh, 13, I have to destroy, it's time to destroy.
[12896.30s -> 12901.54s]  I have to destroy the town. I have to just kill everybody.
[12901.54s -> 12903.54s]  I have to kill everyone!
[12905.78s -> 12909.24s]  I didn't want to do this!
[12909.24s -> 12919.86s]  Reload the save, the save reload is from an hour ago.
[12919.86s -> 12925.08s]  I can't do that. Just kill everyone and send it to missionary.
[12925.08s -> 12938.46s]  Where's lightning?
[12938.46s -> 12941.34s]  You guys are worshipping in the wrong one.
[12941.34s -> 12948.75s]  It's okay.
[12948.75s -> 12950.75s]  I just want to get the cow back.
[12950.75s -> 12956.24s]  Why would this mission even be here? This, like, level three?
[12956.24s -> 12959.00s]  What?
[12959.00s -> 12963.00s]  I'm so upset. I can't fucking believe I have to do this again.
[12963.00s -> 12970.82s]  Should I reload it? Should I reload it? How far away was that actually? What time is it?
[12970.82s -> 12972.82s]  Five, like, let's say 540.
[12972.82s -> 12976.82s]  It was like 30 minutes ago. Let's do it. Let's just reload it. I'm going for it.
[12976.82s -> 12990.06s]  Because nothing is worse than having to get 14 fucking hundred, I believe.
[12990.06s -> 12992.62s]  It was like 250.
[12992.62s -> 12995.69s]  Watch out for those dogs!
[12995.69s -> 13006.25s]  519.
[13006.25s -> 13023.68s]  Didn't you say this is as good as Half-Life 1?
[13023.68s -> 13027.97s]  See, it's 400.
[13027.97s -> 13032.17s]  Fuck, I just want my fucking cow!
[13032.17s -> 13034.80s]  Oh my god.
[13034.80s -> 13042.67s]  Give me a fucking break.
[13042.67s -> 13051.56s]  I should just play Skirmish.
[13051.56s -> 13053.93s]  I'm in too deep now.
[13053.93s -> 13058.64s]  Just stock up on Miracle Juice.
[13058.64s -> 13064.42s]  Yeah, I'm just going to go for a fucking total destruction, I think.
[13064.42s -> 13069.35s]  Like, I...
[13069.35s -> 13076.58s]  What do I need?
[13076.58s -> 13084.75s]  Alright, we have to break. Everybody get up here.
[13084.75s -> 13091.96s]  Just get rid of this for a fucking second.
[13091.96s -> 13095.16s]  I need juice.
[13095.16s -> 13100.74s]  I'm going to torch the place and then fucking water it down.
[13100.74s -> 13105.03s]  Let's go.
[13105.03s -> 13109.85s]  Fireball. Thank you very much.
[13110.85s -> 13129.96s]  And then I'm going to keep those people there and then I'm going to get the lightning ready.
[13129.96s -> 13131.96s]  I'm going to wait.
[13131.96s -> 13136.14s]  Because I also need people to be worshipping at the other one too.
[13136.14s -> 13142.09s]  To get lightning.
[13142.09s -> 13145.09s]  Abuse pause spam near Lethis's temple.
[13145.09s -> 13148.09s]  Let me try. Hold on a minute.
[13169.11s -> 13174.25s]  Kill.
[13174.25s -> 13177.32s]  Did that not hit anybody?
[13177.32s -> 13187.95s]  That didn't do anything.
[13192.68s -> 13193.68s]  Good.
[13193.68s -> 13196.82s]  Alright, water.
[13197.82s -> 13207.08s]  Hurry up and worship me so I can get some damn water.
[13210.28s -> 13217.60s]  Okay.
[13217.60s -> 13219.35s]  How much do I need?
[13219.35s -> 13220.35s]  330.
[13220.35s -> 13221.35s]  Do it again.
[13229.13s -> 13234.06s]  Don't put it all out. Uh oh.
[13234.06s -> 13239.16s]  Fuck my influence. I have no influence over it.
[13244.43s -> 13256.40s]  I'm trying to save you.
[13256.40s -> 13264.69s]  It's going to keep spreading.
[13264.69s -> 13267.69s]  It's going to spread everywhere.
[13267.69s -> 13271.69s]  Oh, what have I done? What have I done? What have I done?
[13277.13s -> 13283.38s]  Am I not getting belief points anymore? Have they caught on to my bullshit?
[13283.38s -> 13289.65s]  Alright, just kill everybody.
[13289.65s -> 13293.75s]  Yeah, they caught on.
[13293.75s -> 13298.48s]  Make them suffer.
[13301.66s -> 13307.29s]  Would you even go over there?
[13307.29s -> 13310.29s]  That doesn't even make any mechanical sense.
[13332.00s -> 13335.68s]  Oh, he's coming over here.
[13335.68s -> 13338.04s]  What's he doing over here?
[13338.04s -> 13346.92s]  Now heal them.
[13371.65s -> 13372.65s]  Why?
[13372.65s -> 13375.65s]  It's like what do you think I'm trying to do?
[13385.15s -> 13395.03s]  Do it again.
[13395.03s -> 13398.89s]  Heal.
[13398.89s -> 13399.89s]  200 belief needed.
[13399.89s -> 13402.89s]  I hope I, I gotta get a save after this.
[13402.89s -> 13404.89s]  That guy's stealing trees.
[13404.89s -> 13405.89s]  Why?
[13408.39s -> 13409.39s]  40 belief?
[13409.39s -> 13410.39s]  Nice, okay.
[13410.39s -> 13412.39s]  Now, hurt them again.
[13412.39s -> 13419.90s]  Where?
[13421.90s -> 13435.39s]  Okay, there you go.
[13435.39s -> 13437.39s]  Flamin' hot cheese?
[13437.39s -> 13438.39s]  Trees?
[13438.39s -> 13445.24s]  Just throw the wolves next time.
[13445.24s -> 13446.24s]  Can I?
[13449.41s -> 13454.79s]  What just happened?
[13454.79s -> 13456.79s]  So just throw the wolves.
[13460.76s -> 13462.51s]  Is that not healing anybody?
[13462.51s -> 13463.51s]  Alright, I'm done.
[13463.51s -> 13464.51s]  Time to fuck it.
[13464.51s -> 13465.51s]  I'm just going for it.
[13465.51s -> 13471.20s]  Just torture Twitter again.
[13473.20s -> 13486.00s]  Alright, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal.
[13486.00s -> 13505.55s]  Hurry up.
[13505.55s -> 13509.55s]  It's like 60% of my entire, I was supposed to say audience.
[13515.26s -> 13517.26s]  Apparently that's not doing anything anymore.
[13523.48s -> 13536.75s]  Now, seriously, don't do this bullshit again.
[13536.75s -> 13547.65s]  I want our cow back.
[13547.65s -> 13548.65s]  I want him back.
[13548.65s -> 13549.65s]  I miss him.
[13549.65s -> 13555.58s]  I haven't even seen him all stream.
[13555.58s -> 13561.06s]  Okay, everybody alright?
[13561.06s -> 13571.30s]  I'm coming.
[13571.30s -> 13573.80s]  Save the game?
[13573.80s -> 13575.80s]  It's gonna crash.
[13575.80s -> 13585.80s]  It will.
[13585.80s -> 13586.80s]  Don't do it.
[13586.80s -> 13595.21s]  I know.
[13595.21s -> 13600.29s]  Wait for an autosave.
[13600.29s -> 13602.29s]  I just have to not fuck it up.
[13605.29s -> 13606.29s]  No, no, no.
[13606.29s -> 13607.47s]  Lightning.
[13607.47s -> 13609.47s]  This is worse than the Wiimote gestures.
[13609.47s -> 13612.47s]  This is 2001 gestures.
[13622.36s -> 13637.20s]  Just cut it down.
[13637.20s -> 13649.68s]  Shit's on fucking fire.
[13650.68s -> 13651.68s]  Save!
[13651.68s -> 13652.68s]  Got one.
[13652.68s -> 13655.56s]  Got one.
[13655.56s -> 13656.56s]  Everybody live in here.
[13656.56s -> 13662.22s]  Three people are alive.
[13662.22s -> 13665.00s]  Let's go.
[13672.36s -> 13677.18s]  Everybody's good.
[13678.18s -> 13679.18s]  Okay.
[13679.18s -> 13681.19s]  Three villages.
[13681.19s -> 13686.19s]  And now imagine my annoyance when I did it last time.
[13686.19s -> 13687.19s]  And I didn't get a game.
[13687.19s -> 13689.19s]  I didn't get a save.
[13689.19s -> 13692.54s]  The fuck?
[13692.54s -> 13700.31s]  Alright, I got a lot of energy.
[13700.31s -> 13704.12s]  Let's drop this down.
[13704.12s -> 13706.58s]  Let's go 20%.
[13706.58s -> 13708.58s]  20% and 20%.
[13708.58s -> 13714.21s]  People need to get back to work.
[13714.21s -> 13722.34s]  Am I using the 1.4 patch?
[13722.34s -> 13723.34s]  Yes, I am.
[13723.34s -> 13724.34s]  1.43?
[13724.34s -> 13731.76s]  Alright, I got a forest miracle.
[13731.76s -> 13734.96s]  Got a lightning miracle.
[13734.96s -> 13737.52s]  We're going to bring some people over here.
[13737.52s -> 13739.52s]  And change them to live over here.
[13739.52s -> 13743.96s]  Yeah, we're going to move some people.
[13743.96s -> 13746.52s]  Do you live here now?
[13746.52s -> 13751.89s]  Yeah, that's what I wanted to do.
[13753.77s -> 13756.23s]  Like...
[13758.66s -> 13759.66s]  Fix everything.
[13759.66s -> 13762.95s]  Alright, here he comes.
[13762.95s -> 13763.95s]  Here he comes.
[13763.95s -> 13767.77s]  He's upset that I did this.
[13767.77s -> 13768.77s]  Chilling out.
[13768.77s -> 13772.42s]  Come live over here.
[13773.42s -> 13775.42s]  Just throw the wolves.
[13775.42s -> 13776.42s]  I'm going for that.
[13776.42s -> 13785.28s]  I'm going to whip them.
[13785.28s -> 13786.28s]  Alright, who needs wood?
[13786.28s -> 13788.60s]  You do.
[13788.60s -> 13789.60s]  How much?
[13789.60s -> 13792.12s]  Okay, you can build that.
[13792.12s -> 13793.12s]  Fix that up.
[13793.12s -> 13800.81s]  We need food.
[13800.81s -> 13805.80s]  I'm working on it.
[13806.80s -> 13809.56s]  Miracle food.
[13809.56s -> 13817.72s]  So we just call them a crybaby?
[13817.72s -> 13820.18s]  Whoa.
[13820.18s -> 13822.18s]  Easy.
[13822.18s -> 13827.49s]  Miracle food.
[13827.49s -> 13830.05s]  More, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more.
[13830.05s -> 13831.55s]  Okay.
[13831.55s -> 13832.55s]  One more.
[13832.55s -> 13834.81s]  Fixing up the town.
[13834.81s -> 13835.81s]  Everything's good to go.
[13835.81s -> 13851.56s]  There's a lot of settlements over here.
[13851.56s -> 13852.56s]  Just pause?
[13852.56s -> 13854.56s]  I could just pause, you're right.
[13854.56s -> 13856.37s]  Uh, hello?
[13856.37s -> 13858.37s]  This is taking a long time.
[13858.37s -> 13861.00s]  Miracle food.
[13861.00s -> 13868.00s]  You may have your few believers, but I can still command the beasts of the wilderness.
[13868.00s -> 13869.00s]  Did he just kill everything?
[13869.00s -> 13872.00s]  I think he just accidentally killed all of his stuff.
[13872.00s -> 13875.64s]  They're all on fire?
[13875.64s -> 13880.42s]  It seems you have meet the wolf.
[13880.42s -> 13881.42s]  Here we go.
[13881.42s -> 13883.42s]  But I think I can help you.
[13883.42s -> 13885.42s]  I will try to destroy some of the wolves.
[13885.42s -> 13886.42s]  They're on fire.
[13886.42s -> 13887.42s]  That is all.
[13887.42s -> 13888.42s]  Okay, here we go.
[13888.42s -> 13892.11s]  Get the food miracle off of my bar.
[13892.11s -> 13912.72s]  Uh, get the food miracle.
[13912.72s -> 13917.67s]  I can't pick them up.
[13917.67s -> 13942.28s]  Lightning and I, you can't throw, I can't, I can't, I cannot do anything past here.
[13942.28s -> 13946.80s]  I can't do anything past here.
[13946.80s -> 13949.80s]  I can't grab anything, I can't cast any spells.
[13949.80s -> 13954.51s]  I can't do anything past my influence.
[13954.51s -> 13970.51s]  I need the fucking actor over here.
[13970.51s -> 13973.68s]  What a crock of shit.
[13973.68s -> 14008.05s]  Use the actor and put a shield up.
[14008.05s -> 14011.94s]  What the fuck, man.
[14011.94s -> 14023.20s]  When it comes to meltdown?
[14023.20s -> 14025.20s]  No, but like, why?
[14025.20s -> 14028.53s]  You big bully.
[14028.53s -> 14030.53s]  Please don't throw me.
[14030.53s -> 14034.56s]  You didn't kill me.
[14034.56s -> 14038.57s]  Please don't throw me.
[14038.57s -> 14040.57s]  On my arm.
[14040.57s -> 14041.57s]  Here they come.
[14041.57s -> 14042.57s]  All right.
[14042.57s -> 14044.57s]  Stop doing fucking slow motion.
[14044.57s -> 14046.57s]  What's the point of doing it every time?
[14046.57s -> 14048.57s]  Oh, you big bully.
[14048.57s -> 14051.57s]  Try it again and you're dead.
[14051.57s -> 14058.89s]  I need you over here.
[14058.89s -> 14061.90s]  Please don't throw me.
[14061.90s -> 14062.90s]  Oh my God.
[14062.90s -> 14064.90s]  Stop doing slow motion.
[14064.90s -> 14068.61s]  They're going to get in.
[14068.61s -> 14069.61s]  I should have just done.
[14069.61s -> 14071.36s]  Oh, what a great feature.
[14071.36s -> 14074.69s]  Slow mo everything.
[14074.69s -> 14076.69s]  You didn't kill me.
[14076.69s -> 14081.84s]  I don't even know where they are.
[14081.84s -> 14096.58s]  Are they dead?
[14096.58s -> 14100.64s]  Do I know lightning?
[14100.64s -> 14110.29s]  I do know lightning, but it's going to take too long to load it up and I can't cast it over here.
[14110.29s -> 14111.29s]  I don't see anything.
[14111.29s -> 14112.29s]  You see anything?
[14112.29s -> 14113.53s]  I think I did it.
[14113.53s -> 14115.86s]  I don't see any.
[14115.86s -> 14119.47s]  Did I do it?
[14119.47s -> 14129.28s]  Leave it.
[14129.28s -> 14131.28s]  I'm not worth it.
[14131.28s -> 14136.11s]  I think that's it.
[14136.11s -> 14138.31s]  What do you mean it's there?
[14138.31s -> 14139.31s]  What do you mean it's there?
[14139.31s -> 14140.31s]  Where?
[14140.31s -> 14141.31s]  Where?
[14141.31s -> 14146.77s]  What are you talking about?
[14146.77s -> 14147.77s]  This is one more.
[14147.77s -> 14155.60s]  What do you see one more?
[14155.60s -> 14156.60s]  What are you talking about?
[14156.60s -> 14158.48s]  No, there's no more.
[14158.48s -> 14161.39s]  No, there's no more.
[14161.39s -> 14167.88s]  We're good.
[14167.88s -> 14172.32s]  Oh, hell.
[14172.32s -> 14173.32s]  You didn't kill me.
[14173.32s -> 14174.32s]  No, there's no more.
[14174.32s -> 14175.32s]  All right.
[14175.32s -> 14176.32s]  We're safe.
[14176.32s -> 14177.32s]  Back to work.
[14177.32s -> 14179.68s]  Why won't the game save?
[14179.68s -> 14181.63s]  Fuck if I know.
[14181.63s -> 14193.72s]  Throw me around.
[14193.72s -> 14200.23s]  Now, how am I going to get out there?
[14200.23s -> 14206.00s]  This is going to be a huge pain in the ass to go all the way down here.
[14206.00s -> 14208.31s]  Check under the tree.
[14208.31s -> 14212.40s]  There's nothing there.
[14212.40s -> 14214.40s]  No, you don't scare me.
[14214.40s -> 14216.40s]  I'm going to I'm going to grow this town.
[14216.40s -> 14217.40s]  Yeah.
[14217.40s -> 14223.38s]  Okay.
[14223.38s -> 14225.77s]  I just scared the absolute shit out of me.
[14225.77s -> 14226.77s]  I thought there was one in here.
[14226.77s -> 14227.77s]  All right.
[14227.77s -> 14228.77s]  Let's bring some.
[14228.77s -> 14229.77s]  I got to get some people over here.
[14229.77s -> 14234.36s]  We have to build up this town.
[14234.36s -> 14235.36s]  Chilling out.
[14235.36s -> 14236.36s]  You're now over here.
[14236.36s -> 14237.36s]  I'm not worth it.
[14237.36s -> 14238.36s]  Fix that, please.
[14238.36s -> 14239.36s]  Chilling out.
[14239.36s -> 14242.52s]  Chilling out.
[14242.52s -> 14243.52s]  Chilling out.
[14243.52s -> 14247.00s]  Disciple builder.
[14247.00s -> 14248.00s]  Fix this place up.
[14248.00s -> 14249.30s]  Okay.
[14249.30s -> 14250.30s]  Now fix this one, too.
[14250.30s -> 14254.87s]  Disciple builder.
[14254.87s -> 14255.87s]  We need people to live here.
[14255.87s -> 14256.87s]  If you see this.
[14256.87s -> 14257.87s]  What are you doing?
[14257.87s -> 14261.99s]  Oh, please don't pick me up.
[14261.99s -> 14262.99s]  I hope that I can't wait till that guy's dead.
[14262.99s -> 14263.99s]  I really can't wait till that guy's dead.
[14263.99s -> 14265.87s]  Okay.
[14265.87s -> 14266.87s]  How much wood do we need?
[14266.87s -> 14267.87s]  Disciple builder.
[14267.87s -> 14268.87s]  I have plenty of wood.
[14268.87s -> 14270.49s]  Let me dump some on all these places.
[14270.49s -> 14292.17s]  I want the cow back so bad.
[14292.17s -> 14302.67s]  Who lives here?
[14302.67s -> 14312.27s]  Wood required, 23.
[14312.27s -> 14314.27s]  Just fix this place up.
[14314.27s -> 14321.84s]  Right here.
[14321.84s -> 14322.84s]  All right.
[14322.84s -> 14324.92s]  Build it back up.
[14324.92s -> 14325.92s]  I need to...
[14325.92s -> 14327.92s]  I need people to come and actually live here.
[14327.92s -> 14335.79s]  I thought the prison was 98.
[14335.79s -> 14336.79s]  Holy shit.
[14336.79s -> 14339.18s]  Okay.
[14339.18s -> 14342.18s]  How do I get you to live here, though?
[14342.18s -> 14343.18s]  There we go.
[14343.18s -> 14344.18s]  Live here and love.
[14344.18s -> 14345.18s]  Live here and love.
[14345.18s -> 14346.18s]  Live here and love.
[14346.18s -> 14347.18s]  Live here and love.
[14347.18s -> 14348.18s]  More of you.
[14348.18s -> 14349.18s]  I think I can drop...
[14349.18s -> 14350.18s]  This town has a ton of people in it.
[14350.18s -> 14351.18s]  Let's drop the worshipping a little bit.
[14351.18s -> 14352.18s]  Yeah, we can do like...
[14352.18s -> 14358.67s]  15% is fine.
[14358.67s -> 14359.67s]  Sleeping at home.
[14359.67s -> 14361.55s]  We need more people to live.
[14361.55s -> 14362.55s]  Your worshippers are working assholes.
[14362.55s -> 14366.16s]  Good.
[14366.16s -> 14367.16s]  It's not good.
[14367.16s -> 14369.10s]  That's...
[14369.10s -> 14370.10s]  What am I talking about?
[14370.10s -> 14371.10s]  Okay, then.
[14371.10s -> 14372.10s]  Over here.
[14372.10s -> 14375.64s]  You live here now?
[14375.64s -> 14376.64s]  Can you not live there?
[14376.64s -> 14377.64s]  Oh, it's a kid.
[14377.64s -> 14378.64s]  It's a little kid.
[14378.64s -> 14379.64s]  God damn it.
[14379.64s -> 14380.64s]  Balding?
[14380.64s -> 14381.64s]  Oh, building.
[14381.64s -> 14383.20s]  27.
[14383.20s -> 14384.20s]  Okay.
[14384.20s -> 14385.20s]  Okay.
[14385.20s -> 14386.76s]  Okay.
[14386.76s -> 14387.76s]  Okay.
[14387.76s -> 14388.76s]  Okay.
[14388.76s -> 14390.32s]  Okay.
[14390.32s -> 14391.32s]  Okay.
[14391.32s -> 14394.93s]  Okay.
[14394.93s -> 14400.20s]  Okay.
[14400.20s -> 14401.20s]  Okay.
[14402.20s -> 14403.20s]  It's a little kid.
[14403.20s -> 14404.20s]  God damn it.
[14404.20s -> 14407.04s]  Balding?
[14407.04s -> 14413.85s]  Oh, building.
[14413.85s -> 14414.85s]  27.
[14414.85s -> 14421.70s]  Live here and love.
[14421.70s -> 14422.70s]  Yes.
[14422.70s -> 14423.70s]  All right.
[14423.70s -> 14425.64s]  More.
[14425.64s -> 14429.33s]  We have to really start to settle in this area.
[14429.33s -> 14432.33s]  Because this is going to be the one of the last towns.
[14432.33s -> 14433.70s]  Live here.
[14433.70s -> 14435.70s]  Live here and love.
[14435.70s -> 14437.70s]  In fact, you need to breed.
[14437.70s -> 14440.41s]  Breed if you can.
[14440.41s -> 14443.06s]  What do we got?
[14443.06s -> 14444.06s]  Any...
[14444.06s -> 14445.06s]  Do we have breeders here?
[14445.06s -> 14448.35s]  Breeder?
[14448.35s -> 14449.35s]  Yeah.
[14449.35s -> 14450.35s]  You guys...
[14450.35s -> 14451.35s]  You gotta breed.
[14451.35s -> 14452.35s]  You guys gotta breed.
[14452.35s -> 14453.35s]  Wait, 80?
[14453.35s -> 14454.59s]  Breed.
[14454.59s -> 14455.59s]  Finally.
[14455.59s -> 14457.72s]  Breed.
[14457.72s -> 14459.22s]  There we are.
[14459.22s -> 14460.22s]  Okay.
[14460.22s -> 14461.22s]  A couple more.
[14461.22s -> 14462.22s]  And then we should be good.
[14462.22s -> 14463.22s]  For now, at least.
[14463.22s -> 14473.31s]  I'm going to bring a ton of that food over here.
[14473.31s -> 14474.31s]  They don't need it.
[14474.31s -> 14477.28s]  No, no, no, no.
[14477.28s -> 14478.28s]  No.
[14478.28s -> 14479.28s]  You do live here already.
[14479.28s -> 14480.28s]  Live here and love.
[14480.28s -> 14481.71s]  Your people are dying through over-worship.
[14481.71s -> 14482.71s]  Stop this at once.
[14482.71s -> 14483.71s]  There's only like 10...
[14483.71s -> 14488.71s]  There's only like 10% of people doing it right now.
[14488.71s -> 14489.71s]  What?
[14489.71s -> 14497.99s]  All right.
[14497.99s -> 14514.08s]  Give me some of this food.
[14514.08s -> 14515.08s]  Okay.
[14515.08s -> 14516.08s]  Now they have food.
[14516.08s -> 14517.25s]  Now they'll be breeding.
[14517.25s -> 14518.25s]  And then I need a...
[14518.25s -> 14519.25s]  Where's a...
[14519.25s -> 14521.52s]  Where's a production yard?
[14521.52s -> 14522.52s]  Do they have one in here?
[14522.52s -> 14532.93s]  I don't think they do.
[14532.93s -> 14533.93s]  Going home.
[14533.93s -> 14534.93s]  All right.
[14534.93s -> 14537.20s]  You live here.
[14537.20s -> 14538.20s]  Somebody has to fix this shit up.
[14538.20s -> 14541.04s]  Whatever.
[14541.04s -> 14542.04s]  All right.
[14542.04s -> 14545.79s]  With this starting to fill up a little.
[14545.79s -> 14546.79s]  Giving birth.
[14546.79s -> 14547.79s]  There we go.
[14547.79s -> 14549.79s]  Do they have one of those children places here?
[14549.79s -> 14550.79s]  I don't think they do.
[14550.79s -> 14552.92s]  All right.
[14552.92s -> 14557.94s]  Wood.
[14557.94s -> 14560.94s]  Do we need a child care center or whatever it's called?
[14560.94s -> 14575.62s]  They already have one.
[14575.62s -> 14577.63s]  Well, I need to build something.
[14577.63s -> 14578.63s]  Does it need wood?
[14578.63s -> 14583.84s]  No, that's right.
[14583.84s -> 14584.84s]  It's right there.
[14584.84s -> 14588.27s]  I need another one of those construction yards.
[14588.27s -> 14589.27s]  The workshops.
[14589.27s -> 14591.21s]  All right.
[14591.21s -> 14595.65s]  I need a civic...
[14595.65s -> 14596.65s]  What is it?
[14596.65s -> 14597.65s]  What's it called?
[14597.65s -> 14600.65s]  Three to make a civic building.
[14600.65s -> 14604.66s]  Should I make a new village center?
[14604.66s -> 14613.34s]  Or should I make a civic building?
[14613.34s -> 14616.50s]  Launch an attack?
[14616.50s -> 14617.50s]  You can't.
[14617.50s -> 14623.39s]  It doesn't exist.
[14623.39s -> 14625.39s]  We haven't had the cow in three hours.
[14625.39s -> 14626.39s]  I know the time.
[14626.39s -> 14627.39s]  Yeah, I know.
[14627.39s -> 14628.39s]  Well, is that my fault?
[14628.39s -> 14637.16s]  We have this awesome, really cool, fun, awesome mechanic where you have an animal and they
[14637.16s -> 14647.61s]  just take the fucking thing away from you three hours, four hours into the game.
[14647.61s -> 14648.61s]  Can I bring this?
[14648.61s -> 14650.17s]  What should I do?
[14650.17s -> 14656.36s]  This is to make a workshop over here.
[14656.36s -> 14658.92s]  I need to like right there.
[14658.92s -> 14659.92s]  What is it?
[14659.92s -> 14663.72s]  Workshop?
[14663.72s -> 14664.72s]  How far can I go out?
[14664.72s -> 14669.45s]  Do they have a workshop?
[14669.45s -> 14671.78s]  They don't, do they?
[14671.78s -> 14673.02s]  All right.
[14673.02s -> 14674.02s]  This is it.
[14674.02s -> 14681.19s]  This is a cow waiting room.
[14681.19s -> 14682.19s]  Yeah, I know.
[14682.19s -> 14693.92s]  Me too.
[14693.92s -> 14712.50s]  The reason why I did the workshop here is because I'm going to spam trees into it.
[14712.50s -> 14713.50s]  Name the cow.
[14713.50s -> 14717.04s]  I already did.
[14717.04s -> 14718.04s]  What's the name?
[14718.04s -> 14729.73s]  How much more wood?
[14729.73s -> 14733.47s]  Okay.
[14733.47s -> 14734.47s]  Build it.
[14734.47s -> 14735.47s]  You too.
[14735.47s -> 14738.47s]  Did I just grab you?
[14738.47s -> 14750.20s]  Build it.
[14762.39s -> 14767.61s]  No.
[14767.61s -> 14771.32s]  Sacrifice.
[14771.32s -> 14774.32s]  No, I'm not going to sacrifice.
[14774.32s -> 14781.40s]  We need, uh, I need more builders over here.
[14781.40s -> 14782.40s]  I got to get this.
[14782.40s -> 14783.40s]  Get done.
[14783.40s -> 14784.40s]  Get it done.
[14784.40s -> 14785.40s]  Hurry up.
[14785.40s -> 14789.50s]  I don't know where the fuck you're going.
[14789.50s -> 14794.68s]  Put down the tree.
[14794.68s -> 14800.51s]  Is he going to ever build the graveyard?
[14800.51s -> 14805.51s]  The idea here is when this is built, I'm going to spam trees into it and build a ton of shit
[14805.51s -> 14811.37s]  and just command and conquer red alert my way over here and then take this over.
[14811.37s -> 14820.01s]  But they have to build it first.
[14820.01s -> 14823.66s]  Get a graveyard already.
[14823.66s -> 14824.66s]  It's part of the plan.
[14824.66s -> 14825.90s]  How are we doing on food?
[14825.90s -> 14826.90s]  We're okay.
[14826.90s -> 14831.44s]  We're okay on wood.
[14831.44s -> 14832.44s]  Almost done.
[14832.44s -> 14834.44s]  Do I need one more builder over here?
[14834.44s -> 14835.44s]  Yes.
[14835.44s -> 14837.77s]  Disciple builder.
[14837.77s -> 14844.28s]  Oh, I got to ask you a question.
[14844.28s -> 14846.64s]  What's, uh, what game is better?
[14846.64s -> 14850.64s]  Uh, London 2012 or Beijing 2008?
[14850.64s -> 14856.61s]  I want to play one of those Olympic track and field games.
[14856.61s -> 14866.00s]  Which one is better?
[14866.00s -> 14867.00s]  The London one is better?
[14867.00s -> 14869.65s]  I've seen a lot of London.
[14869.65s -> 14870.65s]  Okay.
[14870.65s -> 14876.18s]  Mario and Sonic?
[14876.18s -> 14878.18s]  Yeah, I'm already going to play Mario and Sonic.
[14878.18s -> 14880.12s]  All right.
[14880.12s -> 14882.12s]  Let me see how far the influence goes here.
[14882.12s -> 14883.12s]  All right.
[14883.12s -> 14884.12s]  Can we get a fresh start?
[14884.12s -> 14889.12s]  Can we get like, can we, can we start to progress instead of having me regress mentally?
[14889.12s -> 14896.36s]  I want my cow and I'm not stopping the stream until I get him back.
[14896.36s -> 14900.45s]  Not in a million years.
[14900.45s -> 14901.45s]  Send missionaries.
[14901.45s -> 14904.78s]  I can't go that far.
[14904.78s -> 14908.78s]  If I grab a missionary, I have to like, see, I can't do anything.
[14908.78s -> 14924.10s]  Hurry up and build this damn thing.
[14924.10s -> 14925.10s]  Just throw them and hope they live.
[14925.10s -> 14932.35s]  Then if I throw somebody that far, they're not going to live.
[14932.35s -> 14943.72s]  I don't believe it.
[14943.72s -> 14946.49s]  Good.
[14946.49s -> 14947.49s]  Just so you don't know.
[14947.49s -> 14953.87s]  Is it really taking the three this long to build this?
[14953.87s -> 14965.35s]  Like, what is taking you so long?
[14965.35s -> 14966.35s]  What's this?
[14966.35s -> 14968.35s]  It seems you require help.
[14968.35s -> 14971.35s]  That last village is causing you trouble.
[14971.35s -> 14975.35s]  So I have given your people the ability to build a wonder.
[14975.35s -> 14976.35s]  No.
[14976.35s -> 14977.35s]  Too many resources.
[14977.35s -> 14978.35s]  Too many resources.
[14978.35s -> 14979.35s]  Too many resources.
[14979.35s -> 14981.35s]  I don't have the resources.
[14981.35s -> 14984.29s]  That is all.
[14984.29s -> 14985.29s]  I don't have the resources to do this.
[14985.29s -> 14988.29s]  Twenty one thousand fucking resources.
[14988.29s -> 14989.29s]  Thanks for nothing.
[14989.29s -> 14995.64s]  Thanks for, thanks for pawning off your shitty real estate that won't sell.
[14995.64s -> 14998.82s]  Oh, I have this wonderful four bedroom.
[14998.82s -> 15003.12s]  It's just, it's a fixer offer, but you know, you can work with it.
[15003.12s -> 15005.07s]  Out of here.
[15005.07s -> 15015.44s]  It's literally surrounded by wood.
[15015.44s -> 15016.44s]  Yeah, but I still have to build it.
[15016.44s -> 15019.44s]  I think these guys can't even make a workshop.
[15019.44s -> 15023.72s]  And why do I not have any influence?
[15023.72s -> 15026.86s]  I own this building.
[15026.86s -> 15034.41s]  This is outside of my influence.
[15034.41s -> 15041.22s]  What the fuck?
[15041.22s -> 15056.26s]  No.
[15056.26s -> 15058.26s]  No.
[15058.26s -> 15062.16s]  I need a town center.
[15062.16s -> 15063.16s]  Well, let's go.
[15063.16s -> 15083.39s]  I'm doing all this for my boy, my baby boy.
[15083.39s -> 15085.39s]  I'm coming to get him.
[15085.39s -> 15094.24s]  Was it three there?
[15094.24s -> 15095.24s]  Okay.
[15095.24s -> 15098.83s]  Town center.
[15098.83s -> 15103.24s]  It's five, right?
[15103.24s -> 15106.24s]  Five for a new village center.
[15106.24s -> 15112.54s]  Click the link.
[15112.54s -> 15114.54s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not yet.
[15114.54s -> 15120.64s]  Four.
[15120.64s -> 15121.64s]  One more.
[15121.64s -> 15130.04s]  If I don't see a cow this spring, I'm, I guarantee you see a cow this spring.
[15130.04s -> 15131.04s]  Okay.
[15131.04s -> 15143.87s]  There's five here.
[15143.87s -> 15149.63s]  How do I not have to be a field?
[15149.63s -> 15159.10s]  There's five, right?
[15159.10s -> 15161.88s]  Five scaffold.
[15161.88s -> 15182.93s]  I don't fucking care.
[15182.93s -> 15185.93s]  Just build the damn thing.
[15185.93s -> 15187.43s]  He hates the links.
[15187.43s -> 15188.43s]  What's the link?
[15188.43s -> 15189.43s]  Zoinks.
[15189.43s -> 15192.65s]  You've taken a wrong turn.
[15192.65s -> 15193.65s]  The link doesn't work.
[15193.65s -> 15195.79s]  Punished Mega Milk.
[15195.79s -> 15197.79s]  A cow denied by his owner.
[15197.79s -> 15200.79s]  Get that out of here.
[15200.79s -> 15202.79s]  I'm trying to save him.
[15202.79s -> 15205.79s]  I've been trying to save him this whole stream.
[15205.79s -> 15218.04s]  Build.
[15218.04s -> 15219.04s]  I'll put a hundred people over here.
[15219.04s -> 15220.04s]  I don't care.
[15220.04s -> 15224.48s]  Get to work.
[15224.48s -> 15246.06s]  How much more?
[15246.06s -> 15247.06s]  One more.
[15247.06s -> 15249.39s]  Okay.
[15249.39s -> 15250.39s]  Now get some more builders over here.
[15250.39s -> 15251.39s]  And I'm almost done.
[15251.39s -> 15261.01s]  Build.
[15261.01s -> 15274.09s]  More.
[15274.09s -> 15286.34s]  Frank, that's a whole lot of sugar and water.
[15286.34s -> 15292.19s]  More.
[15292.19s -> 15297.20s]  Go.
[15297.20s -> 15315.57s]  Going to sleep on the floor.
[15315.57s -> 15319.57s]  Build me a new town center.
[15319.57s -> 15321.52s]  Hurry.
[15321.52s -> 15323.88s]  So I can go over here.
[15323.88s -> 15336.49s]  Might as well just start dumping wood in this thing.
[15336.49s -> 15337.73s]  Punish them?
[15337.73s -> 15338.73s]  They're okay.
[15338.73s -> 15347.96s]  I'll put like another couple of how, no, we need farms and shit out here.
[15347.96s -> 15358.31s]  Honestly, I wish Jerma would just say he doesn't like the cow.
[15358.31s -> 15362.31s]  We haven't seen him all stream because Jerma's trying to save him, but in reality he doesn't
[15362.31s -> 15368.80s]  want him.
[15368.80s -> 15370.29s]  Fuck.
[15370.29s -> 15371.29s]  God damn it.
[15371.29s -> 15372.29s]  Oh.
[15372.29s -> 15374.72s]  How could you say something like that?
[15374.72s -> 15377.48s]  I love him.
[15377.48s -> 15380.36s]  I love Myrius.
[15380.36s -> 15394.05s]  How could you say something so incorrect?
[15394.05s -> 15397.05s]  Just wait till we get him and it's going to be so much better.
[15397.05s -> 15407.75s]  You just had to remember his name.
[15407.75s -> 15408.75s]  Yeah, that's true.
[15408.75s -> 15409.75s]  You're right.
[15409.75s -> 15410.75s]  Yeah, I did.
[15410.75s -> 15413.88s]  I just, I just forgot his name again.
[15413.88s -> 15420.88s]  Like weirdly enough, I'm forgetting his name because, hold on, let me do the heal.
[15420.88s -> 15427.15s]  Because I keep trying not to say the one that you've been planted in my brain.
[15427.15s -> 15433.10s]  He's not going to be the same.
[15433.10s -> 15434.10s]  Yes, he will.
[15434.10s -> 15436.30s]  Looking at something?
[15436.30s -> 15446.40s]  I've finished building this.
[15446.40s -> 15448.40s]  Finished building that.
[15448.40s -> 15450.40s]  You're driving me crazy.
[15450.40s -> 15453.56s]  What?
[15453.56s -> 15454.56s]  Oh, they're going over there.
[15454.56s -> 15455.73s]  Why?
[15455.73s -> 15456.73s]  All right.
[15456.73s -> 15458.73s]  We're just going to get ourselves another field.
[15458.73s -> 15461.76s]  It's going right.
[15461.76s -> 15462.76s]  Where's it going?
[15462.76s -> 15463.76s]  Right in this town?
[15463.76s -> 15470.64s]  No.
[15470.64s -> 15471.64s]  Up here.
[15471.64s -> 15472.64s]  No.
[15472.64s -> 15473.64s]  Where should that go?
[15473.64s -> 15474.64s]  Do they even have any way to produce food in this town?
[15474.64s -> 15476.20s]  No, this is no food production.
[15476.20s -> 15477.20s]  I'll leave it right there.
[15477.20s -> 15478.20s]  All right.
[15478.20s -> 15479.50s]  What are we going to do over here?
[15479.50s -> 15487.20s]  Like literally, like literally, literally right there.
[15487.20s -> 15489.97s]  Still not done.
[15489.97s -> 15496.88s]  Slowest workers ever.
[15496.88s -> 15501.04s]  Just wait for the redemption arc.
[15501.04s -> 15505.04s]  Right now we're on a yogi arc.
[15505.04s -> 15507.05s]  Just wait.
[15507.05s -> 15512.23s]  Wait until we get the redemption arc from Murius.
[15512.23s -> 15521.51s]  Put wood in the wonder.
[15521.51s -> 15525.22s]  It's too far away for me to reliably do it.
[15525.22s -> 15528.06s]  Yeah.
[15528.06s -> 15533.16s]  It's too far away for me to do it reliably.
[15533.16s -> 15541.18s]  All right.
[15541.18s -> 15542.18s]  It's almost done.
[15542.18s -> 15543.18s]  Hurry up.
[15543.18s -> 15544.18s]  Please.
[15544.18s -> 15559.37s]  I need to get over here.
[15559.37s -> 15560.37s]  This is ridiculous.
[15560.37s -> 15568.81s]  84% complete with a dozen people working on it.
[15568.81s -> 15570.81s]  Peter Molyneux, you're not old enough to work.
[15570.81s -> 15576.51s]  Here comes the filler episode.
[15576.51s -> 15581.05s]  Just wait till we get to the actual arc.
[15581.05s -> 15584.38s]  Why is there a seven-year-old up here?
[15584.38s -> 15590.33s]  Is that the cow making that noise?
[15590.33s -> 15592.33s]  What are you doing here?
[15592.33s -> 15602.92s]  Finish it.
[15602.92s -> 15607.10s]  Finished.
[15607.10s -> 15608.98s]  All right.
[15608.98s -> 15609.98s]  Is it?
[15609.98s -> 15615.36s]  This is the only area I get.
[15615.36s -> 15622.18s]  The population's getting low.
[15622.18s -> 15623.18s]  Oh my God.
[15623.18s -> 15642.70s]  I can't fucking believe it.
[15642.70s -> 15648.72s]  This person's dead.
[15648.72s -> 15651.72s]  This person worked to death, apparently.
[15651.72s -> 15662.76s]  Worked until they died.
[15662.76s -> 15667.24s]  Well, I know where I'm going to put the graveyard.
[15667.24s -> 15677.29s]  I'll put it right over here.
[15677.29s -> 15679.29s]  Just build a line of houses here.
[15679.29s -> 15682.29s]  If I build a house right here, will this expand?
[15682.29s -> 15695.50s]  Somebody...
[15695.50s -> 15697.50s]  They'll just build it.
[15697.50s -> 15700.25s]  Don't work on this right now.
[15700.25s -> 15701.25s]  I can't even pick you up.
[15701.25s -> 15713.67s]  Work on this.
[15713.67s -> 15729.96s]  I just wanted you to work over here.
[15729.96s -> 15730.96s]  Like...
[15730.96s -> 15733.96s]  Ay, ay, ay.
[15733.96s -> 15736.97s]  I'm coming.
[15736.97s -> 15740.04s]  Disciple builder.
[15740.04s -> 15746.88s]  Now we need to breed.
[15746.88s -> 15749.12s]  We're okay with food, right?
[15749.12s -> 15751.12s]  All right, breeding time.
[15751.12s -> 15755.02s]  Anybody who in this town can breed?
[15755.02s -> 15762.81s]  You too, I think.
[15762.81s -> 15763.81s]  Offspray.
[15763.81s -> 15764.81s]  No.
[15764.81s -> 15767.18s]  I gotta start moving people from the other town.
[15767.18s -> 15775.54s]  I'm so sick of that fucking happening.
[15775.54s -> 15776.54s]  Disciple forester.
[15776.54s -> 15778.54s]  What do you think I'm trying to do?
[15778.54s -> 15779.54s]  Disciple forester.
[15779.54s -> 15780.54s]  Like...
[15780.54s -> 15783.04s]  What do you think I'm trying to do?
[15783.04s -> 15784.04s]  Stand next to...
[15784.04s -> 15790.05s]  Disciple breeder.
[15790.05s -> 15791.05s]  He's just pointing and laughing.
[15791.05s -> 15792.05s]  Disciple breeder.
[15792.05s -> 15805.26s]  Offspray.
[15805.26s -> 15806.26s]  Oh my god.
[15806.26s -> 15808.26s]  Disciple breeder.
[15808.26s -> 15812.57s]  Okay.
[15812.57s -> 15814.57s]  We have some breeding going on now.
[15814.57s -> 15817.57s]  We're gonna populate this with that town.
[15817.57s -> 15822.84s]  And hopefully they'll finish this.
[15822.84s -> 15823.84s]  Why are they cutting the tree down?
[15823.84s -> 15825.84s]  Because they needed wood.
[15825.84s -> 15836.21s]  When are you gonna get to the half-life factory?
[15836.21s -> 15838.21s]  I don't even know what that means.
[15838.21s -> 15842.28s]  I don't even know what that means.
[15842.28s -> 15845.48s]  Is that supposed to mean something?
[15845.48s -> 15848.48s]  I don't know if that's supposed to mean something.
[15848.48s -> 15854.78s]  All right, build that.
[15854.78s -> 15861.33s]  How much wood do I need?
[15861.33s -> 15869.63s]  All right, there are like four or five breeders over there now.
[15869.63s -> 15873.21s]  Now finish this hut.
[15873.21s -> 15880.40s]  No, stop going.
[15880.40s -> 15882.40s]  I'll take care of this.
[15882.40s -> 15883.40s]  Why does...
[15883.40s -> 15888.95s]  You don't even need any more wood.
[15888.95s -> 15889.95s]  Why are they doing this?
[15889.95s -> 15896.96s]  Wood required zero.
[15896.96s -> 15908.66s]  What are you guys doing?
[15908.66s -> 15910.66s]  Like sledding.
[15910.66s -> 15922.86s]  Guys, you don't have to go to the forest for wood.
[15922.86s -> 15925.48s]  What are you doing?
[15925.48s -> 15926.48s]  No!
[15926.48s -> 15945.43s]  Are you going?
[15945.43s -> 15949.61s]  Somebody finished this.
[15949.61s -> 15954.39s]  They're chasing after the tree.
[15954.39s -> 15955.39s]  They don't know what to do.
[15955.39s -> 15956.39s]  They can't...
[15956.39s -> 15959.39s]  Going to the building site with the wood.
[15959.39s -> 15965.47s]  And what, may I ask, are you doing that for?
[15965.47s -> 15974.71s]  I'm okay.
[15974.71s -> 15979.17s]  I guess you don't...
[15979.17s -> 15981.17s]  You made two different piles.
[15981.17s -> 15985.31s]  I heard somebody say omega-low in real life and ironically today.
[15985.31s -> 15987.93s]  I've heard that once.
[15987.93s -> 15997.68s]  I've heard it.
[15997.68s -> 16001.56s]  Let's finish it so I can please have some more influence.
[16001.56s -> 16003.56s]  Before I actually shit my pants.
[16003.56s -> 16005.87s]  Alright, how's the breeding going?
[16005.87s -> 16007.68s]  Okay?
[16007.68s -> 16013.92s]  Breeder?
[16013.92s -> 16014.92s]  Breeder?
[16014.92s -> 16015.92s]  Okay, I have a new child.
[16015.92s -> 16016.92s]  What about...
[16016.92s -> 16017.92s]  Okay, let's check the other town.
[16017.92s -> 16018.92s]  We haven't seen it in a while.
[16018.92s -> 16020.92s]  That's 85.
[16020.92s -> 16023.44s]  Dancing.
[16023.44s -> 16024.44s]  Dancing.
[16024.44s -> 16025.44s]  Dancing.
[16025.44s -> 16027.19s]  Okay.
[16027.19s -> 16029.19s]  Let's do some breeding.
[16029.19s -> 16032.94s]  Live here in peace.
[16032.94s -> 16033.94s]  Disciple Breeder.
[16033.94s -> 16036.56s]  I'm going to bring you over here.
[16036.56s -> 16040.56s]  I'm going to bring some more of the young people this way.
[16040.56s -> 16046.48s]  Let's do some breeding over here.
[16046.48s -> 16047.48s]  You live here now.
[16047.48s -> 16052.53s]  Live here in love.
[16052.53s -> 16055.53s]  Live here and love.
[16055.53s -> 16058.53s]  Live here and love specifically.
[16058.53s -> 16061.53s]  These people are all like 10.
[16061.53s -> 16065.48s]  Disciple Builder.
[16065.48s -> 16067.48s]  Offspring.
[16067.48s -> 16068.48s]  Wait, what?
[16068.48s -> 16071.67s]  This wasn't a...
[16071.67s -> 16077.75s]  Alright, I need a female.
[16077.75s -> 16078.75s]  27.
[16078.75s -> 16081.84s]  Is that a female?
[16081.84s -> 16082.84s]  29.
[16082.84s -> 16087.64s]  Alright, let's go.
[16087.64s -> 16094.73s]  I'm working on it.
[16094.73s -> 16096.04s]  Live here.
[16096.04s -> 16097.04s]  Live here in love.
[16097.04s -> 16099.04s]  Live here in love.
[16099.04s -> 16103.09s]  And breed.
[16103.09s -> 16104.09s]  Disciple Breeder.
[16104.09s -> 16105.09s]  There you go.
[16105.09s -> 16106.09s]  Okay, keep it going.
[16106.09s -> 16107.91s]  How are we doing?
[16107.91s -> 16109.34s]  Is this done?
[16109.34s -> 16115.20s]  I mean, it's really not that much more influence.
[16115.20s -> 16118.20s]  It's like barely any at all.
[16118.20s -> 16129.66s]  Save these edits for later.
[16129.66s -> 16133.66s]  For when I get the cow and then probably like turn the stream off.
[16133.66s -> 16137.66s]  Because it's been like 8 hours doing this dumb shit.
[16137.66s -> 16152.29s]  Alright, I gotta start to pull the...
[16152.29s -> 16154.29s]  We gotta start to build this shit.
[16154.29s -> 16162.27s]  Hopefully this actually does what I think it's going to do.
[16162.27s -> 16170.25s]  How many more do I need?
[16170.25s -> 16171.25s]  10,000?
[16171.25s -> 16177.01s]  Does anybody have 10,000 wood over here?
[16177.01s -> 16188.25s]  I'm not even sure there's 10,000 wood in this entire forest.
[16188.25s -> 16189.25s]  I missed the cow.
[16189.25s -> 16195.48s]  Yeah, because without the cow, this game just turns into like a grindy building sim.
[16195.48s -> 16201.89s]  The cow was fun and funny and shit and they took him from us.
[16201.89s -> 16221.92s]  They took him from you.
[16221.92s -> 16225.00s]  Yeah, but it's us.
[16225.00s -> 16227.00s]  We're in this together.
[16227.00s -> 16229.88s]  Can I not grab from this forest?
[16229.88s -> 16240.78s]  Nothing to do.
[16240.78s -> 16243.78s]  Except for build this house.
[16243.78s -> 16247.49s]  Not under attack.
[16247.49s -> 16250.78s]  Build.
[16250.78s -> 16258.91s]  Looking for something to do?
[16258.91s -> 16261.91s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[16261.91s -> 16277.27s]  Do I have to drop the actor here?
[16277.27s -> 16296.47s]  Someone will eventually build this thing.
[16296.47s -> 16297.47s]  I hope.
[16297.47s -> 16301.97s]  How much more wood?
[16301.97s -> 16302.97s]  A thousand.
[16302.97s -> 16314.11s]  I'm starting to shimmy around in my chair.
[16314.11s -> 16315.11s]  Alright.
[16315.11s -> 16319.11s]  For the love of God, build this so I can finish this stupid level.
[16319.11s -> 16326.60s]  Is this what that person was talking about when they said,
[16326.60s -> 16327.60s]  Oh, you got to level three.
[16327.60s -> 16329.60s]  Laugh out loud.
[16329.60s -> 16331.84s]  Is this why you were laughing?
[16331.84s -> 16333.84s]  Is this why you thought this was so funny?
[16333.84s -> 16348.04s]  He warned you.
[16348.04s -> 16355.21s]  Just build this.
[16355.21s -> 16356.21s]  Just build it.
[16356.21s -> 16360.21s]  Does everybody fucking get over here and build this shit?
[16360.21s -> 16362.21s]  I want my cow.
[16362.21s -> 16373.86s]  Disciple builder.
[16373.86s -> 16377.06s]  Your ignorance has led to your defeat?
[16377.06s -> 16381.35s]  I don't think so.
[16381.35s -> 16385.06s]  Disciple builder.
[16385.06s -> 16386.06s]  What do you mean defeat?
[16386.06s -> 16388.06s]  I'm not defeated yet.
[16388.06s -> 16390.96s]  Peter Molyneux.
[16390.96s -> 16394.76s]  Go build this.
[16394.76s -> 16396.76s]  Disciple builder.
[16396.76s -> 16400.28s]  You don't have to go get food.
[16400.28s -> 16401.28s]  I'll take care of that.
[16401.28s -> 16402.28s]  Just stay there.
[16402.28s -> 16409.96s]  I'm just going to dump it right next to you guys.
[16409.96s -> 16410.96s]  Here.
[16410.96s -> 16413.55s]  No, I can't.
[16413.55s -> 16420.14s]  Your influence, you can't move.
[16420.14s -> 16425.99s]  Finish it.
[16425.99s -> 16426.99s]  Forty one.
[16426.99s -> 16427.99s]  Get over here.
[16427.99s -> 16434.84s]  Build it.
[16434.84s -> 16435.84s]  Build it.
[16435.84s -> 16446.64s]  They're getting wood.
[16446.64s -> 16453.11s]  Stomp them.
[16453.11s -> 16456.28s]  I just have to get up here.
[16456.28s -> 16462.28s]  And then we release our friend who we want so desperately and so badly.
[16462.28s -> 16466.28s]  And then when I get out of here, I'm going to fucking murder.
[16466.28s -> 16470.28s]  I'm going to murder this motherfucker right here.
[16470.28s -> 16479.60s]  I'm going to kill that guy so badly.
[16479.60s -> 16484.47s]  So close.
[16484.47s -> 16486.41s]  Build this wonder.
[16486.41s -> 16487.41s]  How close?
[16487.41s -> 16488.41s]  What's the percentage?
[16488.41s -> 16489.41s]  Is it done?
[16489.41s -> 16492.68s]  Twenty seven percent complete.
[16492.68s -> 16494.68s]  Oh, that's a huge.
[16494.68s -> 16495.68s]  That's a that.
[16495.68s -> 16498.71s]  That's a.
[16498.71s -> 16499.71s]  All right.
[16499.71s -> 16503.51s]  In the meantime, let's work on.
[16503.51s -> 16505.51s]  In the meantime, we have to work on family building here.
[16505.51s -> 16515.94s]  We need offspring.
[16515.94s -> 16517.94s]  That's a two year old.
[16517.94s -> 16523.72s]  I wish I could group grab people instead of having to drag all the way across and grab
[16523.72s -> 16529.00s]  somebody and bring them all the way back.
[16529.00s -> 16531.00s]  Disciple forester.
[16531.00s -> 16538.47s]  And I also wish it wasn't the same button.
[16538.47s -> 16539.84s]  You know what I'm saying?
[16539.84s -> 16540.84s]  Like, I don't want you.
[16540.84s -> 16541.84s]  I want you to be.
[16541.84s -> 16542.84s]  I don't.
[16542.84s -> 16544.84s]  Why does it have to be the same button?
[16544.84s -> 16547.84s]  I want you to breed and nothing else.
[16547.84s -> 16551.84s]  And I have to wait till the indicator goes correct because it's a tree next to me.
[16551.84s -> 16558.94s]  Well, I just had it.
[16558.94s -> 16561.18s]  Disciple forester.
[16561.18s -> 16564.12s]  Oh, man, I'm starting to get annoyed.
[16564.12s -> 16571.27s]  The cracks in the armor is showing in black and white one.
[16571.27s -> 16582.39s]  It was the cow that was keeping it all together.
[16582.39s -> 16590.32s]  Stay strong for the cow.
[16590.32s -> 16592.88s]  Oh, I'm going to.
[16592.88s -> 16594.51s]  Don't you worry.
[16594.51s -> 16611.92s]  We need offspring.
[16611.92s -> 16612.92s]  God damn it.
[16612.92s -> 16617.92s]  Build this already so I can stop this madness and have fun.
[16617.92s -> 16625.60s]  Live here in peace.
[16625.60s -> 16628.28s]  But you possibly have nothing to do.
[16628.28s -> 16629.28s]  Fun?
[16629.28s -> 16642.08s]  We're not supposed to be doing that right now.
[16642.08s -> 16650.20s]  What percentage is this at?
[16650.20s -> 16651.20s]  Fifty one.
[16651.20s -> 16652.20s]  It's almost there.
[16652.20s -> 16653.20s]  And then hopefully we get a big circle here.
[16653.20s -> 16657.20s]  And then I can finally just take this over and be done with this.
[16657.20s -> 16662.96s]  We need offspring.
[16662.96s -> 16665.96s]  There are no women in this whole fucking village.
[16665.96s -> 16669.96s]  When I started the game, it was 80 percent men.
[16669.96s -> 16674.09s]  There are no females.
[16674.09s -> 16688.39s]  Disciple breeder.
[16688.39s -> 16690.14s]  Offspring.
[16690.14s -> 16701.30s]  Disciple breeder.
[16701.30s -> 16705.24s]  Disciple breeder.
[16705.24s -> 16711.16s]  Offspring.
[16711.16s -> 16713.16s]  Live here in peace.
[16713.16s -> 16715.16s]  Whose baby is it going to be?
[16715.16s -> 16717.16s]  Whose baby is it going to be?
[16717.16s -> 16718.16s]  I don't know.
[16718.16s -> 16720.16s]  We're not going to know.
[16720.16s -> 16725.60s]  Do the tree puzzle.
[16725.60s -> 16732.00s]  When's my wonder going to be done?
[16732.00s -> 16735.68s]  Do like a paternity test.
[16735.68s -> 16737.68s]  Wow.
[16737.68s -> 16738.86s]  Ooh.
[16738.86s -> 16740.86s]  Whoa.
[16740.86s -> 16741.86s]  We need offspring.
[16741.86s -> 16743.86s]  We need women.
[16743.86s -> 16745.86s]  We need women is what we need.
[16745.86s -> 16749.57s]  Is this person carrying a rock?
[16749.57s -> 16750.57s]  What are you carrying?
[16750.57s -> 16758.06s]  Wow, we need offspring.
[16758.06s -> 16764.06s]  We need more than three women in the entire group.
[16764.06s -> 16780.13s]  Is that a wolf?
[16780.13s -> 16782.13s]  I can't grab them because it's stupid.
[16782.13s -> 16784.13s]  This is a stupid border thing.
[16784.13s -> 16794.03s]  Which one of them is the woman?
[16794.03s -> 16796.03s]  The wolves don't care.
[16796.03s -> 16798.03s]  At least people are breeding over here.
[16798.03s -> 16810.43s]  What's presented?
[16810.43s -> 16811.43s]  Nothing to do.
[16811.43s -> 16817.04s]  Any women.
[16817.04s -> 16818.35s]  Yeah.
[16818.35s -> 16821.35s]  Disciple breeder.
[16821.35s -> 16823.04s]  Disciple breeder.
[16823.04s -> 16826.30s]  Now you have something to do.
[16826.30s -> 16827.30s]  Excuse me.
[16827.30s -> 16828.30s]  Come on out.
[16828.30s -> 16832.57s]  Any women?
[16832.57s -> 16833.57s]  No.
[16833.57s -> 16839.16s]  Go back to bed.
[16839.16s -> 16842.30s]  Any women?
[16842.30s -> 16843.30s]  All right.
[16843.30s -> 16844.30s]  Who's in here?
[16844.30s -> 16852.68s]  There are breeders over here now, right?
[16852.68s -> 16853.99s]  All right.
[16853.99s -> 16854.99s]  Let's go back this way.
[16854.99s -> 16855.99s]  Here we go.
[16855.99s -> 16856.99s]  Okay.
[16856.99s -> 16859.99s]  Now we're making some babies.
[16859.99s -> 16865.39s]  Offspring.
[16865.39s -> 16867.56s]  I think this is the only woman in the whole town.
[16867.56s -> 16868.56s]  These are all her children.
[16868.56s -> 16886.72s]  Look at all these kids now.
[16886.72s -> 16887.72s]  All right.
[16887.72s -> 16888.72s]  We have lots of kids.
[16888.72s -> 16892.17s]  I think we can stop with this now.
[16892.17s -> 16896.60s]  Go back to, go back to foresting.
[16896.60s -> 16897.60s]  Excuse me.
[16897.60s -> 16898.60s]  Get out.
[16898.60s -> 16901.51s]  Get out.
[16901.51s -> 16902.88s]  Get out of the house.
[16902.88s -> 16909.61s]  Oh, were you guys, oh, were you busy in there?
[16909.61s -> 16911.88s]  Wait.
[16911.88s -> 16913.95s]  I need you.
[16913.95s -> 16918.15s]  Do what you're doing, but do it over here.
[16918.15s -> 16925.53s]  Offspring.
[16925.53s -> 16932.64s]  Live here in love.
[16932.64s -> 16937.59s]  Okay.
[16937.59s -> 16938.59s]  Offspring.
[16938.59s -> 16942.59s]  Here comes the 78-year-old female.
[16942.59s -> 16946.94s]  Disciple breeder.
[16946.94s -> 16955.26s]  She's already giving birth?
[16955.26s -> 16957.26s]  Disciple breeder.
[16957.26s -> 16960.14s]  Oh, there we go.
[16960.14s -> 16961.14s]  All right.
[16961.14s -> 16963.15s]  Did you build it yet?
[16963.15s -> 16968.36s]  Who's dead?
[16968.36s -> 16969.36s]  Is somebody dead?
[16969.36s -> 16970.36s]  Who's dead?
[16970.36s -> 16974.16s]  89%.
[16974.16s -> 16977.16s]  Will you fucking just fix it already?
[16977.16s -> 16984.35s]  I need food.
[16984.35s -> 16990.45s]  How's a baby formed?
[16990.45s -> 16994.97s]  Two people that love each other.
[16994.97s -> 16999.39s]  What's half of spring?
[16999.39s -> 17000.95s]  I don't know.
[17000.95s -> 17009.84s]  Ask your parents.
[17009.84s -> 17014.39s]  But you're my dad.
[17014.39s -> 17016.39s]  I am not your dad.
[17016.39s -> 17019.65s]  93%.
[17019.65s -> 17024.98s]  Peter Molyneux, hurry up and finish it.
[17024.98s -> 17028.22s]  Peter Molyneux, hurry up and make another game
[17028.22s -> 17032.40s]  where you make this big group social experiment
[17032.40s -> 17036.40s]  with somebody that gets to the center of a giant cube
[17036.40s -> 17041.40s]  that potentially cost hundreds of dollars to spam mine the cube.
[17041.40s -> 17043.40s]  When they get to the center of that cube,
[17043.40s -> 17047.40s]  you make them the creative director for your new game,
[17047.40s -> 17054.43s]  but it's not real, and that game barely even comes out.
[17054.43s -> 17057.43s]  If you were the last person to click inside of the cube
[17057.43s -> 17059.43s]  in that Peter Molyneux cube game,
[17059.43s -> 17065.40s]  you got to be the creative director of Goddess, right?
[17065.40s -> 17068.64s]  And didn't the person that won not even get to do that?
[17068.64s -> 17070.64s]  Didn't they bring him into a room and they were like,
[17070.64s -> 17072.64s]  ah, well, you're really not going to do that,
[17072.64s -> 17075.64s]  but do you think that this would be fun?
[17075.64s -> 17078.81s]  And the dude's like, I guess.
[17078.81s -> 17080.81s]  Okay, thanks for coming.
[17080.81s -> 17087.75s]  You did it.
[17087.75s -> 17089.75s]  You made it to the center of the cube.
[17089.75s -> 17090.75s]  Wait, we're done.
[17090.75s -> 17091.75s]  We got it.
[17091.75s -> 17093.50s]  Is it done?
[17093.50s -> 17110.97s]  It's not done, is it?
[17110.97s -> 17117.49s]  I didn't get anything, so I got lied to by the yogi guy.
[17117.49s -> 17122.80s]  This doesn't do anything.
[17122.80s -> 17127.80s]  At this point, I think I'm going to start throwing fucking rocks
[17127.80s -> 17128.80s]  from over here.
[17128.80s -> 17166.53s]  I'm just building single houses in a straight line this way.
[17166.53s -> 17186.08s]  Houses don't give influence.
[17186.08s -> 17189.08s]  Only town center and scaffoldings do.
[17189.08s -> 17194.98s]  Well, how the fuck am I supposed to get over here?
[17194.98s -> 17199.08s]  Build another town center over here?
[17199.08s -> 17208.65s]  Do I have to use the throw guy?
[17208.65s -> 17212.21s]  I have to increase my population massively.
[17212.21s -> 17216.24s]  I mean, they're going at it.
[17216.24s -> 17218.24s]  They're going for it.
[17218.24s -> 17227.12s]  Offspring.
[17227.12s -> 17230.37s]  Offspring.
[17230.37s -> 17232.37s]  Live here in peace.
[17232.37s -> 17236.72s]  Offspring.
[17236.72s -> 17239.86s]  It's all men.
[17239.86s -> 17242.74s]  It's all fucking men.
[17242.74s -> 17243.74s]  Offspring.
[17243.74s -> 17245.74s]  We only have men.
[17245.74s -> 17250.64s]  There's only males.
[17250.64s -> 17256.79s]  Why?
[17256.79s -> 17260.69s]  Let's go find out once and fucking for all.
[17260.69s -> 17262.69s]  I want to see just how stupid this is.
[17262.69s -> 17269.88s]  All right.
[17269.88s -> 17272.06s]  60% male.
[17272.06s -> 17274.06s]  But that could be in the other villages.
[17274.06s -> 17280.20s]  No, I don't want to go in the creature cave.
[17280.20s -> 17281.20s]  I want...
[17281.20s -> 17293.81s]  He's angry clicking now.
[17293.81s -> 17294.81s]  I just want to...
[17294.81s -> 17299.63s]  I just want my fucking creature back because that was fun.
[17299.63s -> 17301.63s]  There are so many people over here.
[17301.63s -> 17303.63s]  So many kids.
[17303.63s -> 17304.63s]  We have to start bringing...
[17304.63s -> 17306.63s]  I mean, I have so many people, though.
[17306.63s -> 17308.63s]  Like, I have a lot of people.
[17308.63s -> 17312.63s]  I make up a majority of all the population in this whole world.
[17312.63s -> 17316.66s]  Look at all these kids.
[17316.66s -> 17330.48s]  Do I really have to get the throw guy and, like,
[17330.48s -> 17333.48s]  bring a missionary or something over there?
[17333.48s -> 17339.27s]  What's the premise of this game in five words?
[17339.27s -> 17341.27s]  Game sucks without the cow.
[17341.27s -> 17342.57s]  There.
[17342.57s -> 17354.03s]  Where's the guy that I can throw?
[17354.03s -> 17358.38s]  This guy's 94 years old.
[17358.38s -> 17359.38s]  Throw me around.
[17359.38s -> 17361.38s]  You think I care?
[17361.38s -> 17365.16s]  Please don't throw me.
[17365.16s -> 17367.16s]  94 years old.
[17367.16s -> 17372.89s]  I hope you don't die because I need you.
[17372.89s -> 17375.86s]  All right.
[17375.86s -> 17376.86s]  How much influence do I need here?
[17376.86s -> 17385.78s]  What is it at?
[17385.78s -> 17389.22s]  How much do I need?
[17389.22s -> 17390.22s]  500?
[17390.22s -> 17391.22s]  Not too bad.
[17391.22s -> 17393.84s]  Just destroy the whole fucking town.
[17393.84s -> 17398.32s]  And then I finally get my cow.
[17398.32s -> 17399.32s]  Where is he?
[17399.32s -> 17401.14s]  Please don't throw me.
[17401.14s -> 17402.14s]  You didn't kill me.
[17402.14s -> 17403.14s]  I'm gonna try not to throw you.
[17403.14s -> 17404.14s]  Please don't throw me.
[17404.14s -> 17405.14s]  You didn't kill me.
[17405.14s -> 17406.14s]  All right.
[17406.14s -> 17408.14s]  This is actually where I have to raise the banner here.
[17408.14s -> 17409.14s]  Please don't kill me.
[17409.14s -> 17410.14s]  I need lightning.
[17410.14s -> 17412.14s]  I'm just destroying the whole thing.
[17412.14s -> 17419.36s]  Where's the lightning?
[17419.36s -> 17420.79s]  Here it is.
[17420.79s -> 17421.79s]  All right.
[17421.79s -> 17422.79s]  Let's get lightning.
[17422.79s -> 17423.79s]  Let's do, like, 60%.
[17423.79s -> 17430.00s]  I'm gonna put food over there.
[17430.00s -> 17435.76s]  Must build homes.
[17435.76s -> 17439.15s]  Hopefully we can release that cow.
[17439.15s -> 17441.15s]  The village stored is nearly out of food.
[17441.15s -> 17442.15s]  I know.
[17442.15s -> 17445.15s]  But it don't matter because half of them are going over there anyways to worship.
[17445.15s -> 17449.27s]  They're going to this one, right?
[17449.27s -> 17450.27s]  Yes.
[17450.27s -> 17451.27s]  Is it this one?
[17451.27s -> 17455.35s]  I think it's that one.
[17455.35s -> 17456.35s]  Wait, which one is it?
[17456.35s -> 17462.56s]  Is it the one on the right or the one on the left?
[17462.56s -> 17467.36s]  Yeah, it's the one on the left.
[17467.36s -> 17468.36s]  Give me the lightning.
[17468.36s -> 17469.36s]  Eventually.
[17469.36s -> 17472.39s]  All right.
[17472.39s -> 17474.40s]  There's food over there.
[17474.40s -> 17475.40s]  Hey, where's that actor?
[17475.40s -> 17477.40s]  Let's torch the place.
[17477.40s -> 17488.43s]  Was he dead?
[17488.43s -> 17495.11s]  Where is he?
[17495.11s -> 17510.17s]  Where the hell did he go?
[17510.17s -> 17511.17s]  No, that's not the same guy.
[17511.17s -> 17512.99s]  That's the yogi guy.
[17512.99s -> 17513.99s]  Wasn't he, like, right here?
[17513.99s -> 17514.99s]  Yeah, he was right here.
[17514.99s -> 17516.80s]  Is he fucking dead?
[17516.80s -> 17517.80s]  There he is.
[17517.80s -> 17521.41s]  All right.
[17521.41s -> 17524.44s]  So begins the process again where we use this 100-year-old man to be able to...
[17524.44s -> 17525.44s]  And we have to listen to this shit again.
[17525.44s -> 17568.45s]  Oh, my eye.
[17568.45s -> 17569.79s]  Use him for his intended purpose?
[17569.79s -> 17573.87s]  What the hell is his intended purpose?
[17573.87s -> 17575.75s]  He has an actual purpose?
[17575.75s -> 17593.94s]  earth isn't.
[17615.42s -> 17617.74s]  Put him out! Put him out! Put him out! Put him out! Put him out! Put him out! I need to put him out.
[17619.40s -> 17622.92s]  Put him out! Put him out! Put him out! Put him out! Is he dead? Can he die? He can't die though,

[21372.44s -> 21377.80s]  we lived in peace here and we didn't want for anything then the gods themselves appeared with
[21377.80s -> 21384.12s]  the concepts of good and evil at first always will but then the one called nemesis arrived
[21384.12s -> 21396.70s]  and punished us for following you that dance-off was seriously ridiculous that was some loony-tuned
[21396.70s -> 21404.98s]  shit we were forced to worship him he brought forth fire from the heavens he gave us pillars
[21404.98s -> 21414.15s]  of lightning our lives have become a living hell even the sky turned the color of blood
[21414.95s -> 21425.00s]  but nemesis got bored with us and left us alone he wanted to continue his quest to be the only god
[21425.56s -> 21434.33s]  so he set three guardian stones to the first lies under a spiritual shield even the wisest of our
[21434.33s -> 21441.62s]  people don't know how to reach it it's like the end of the game the second guardian stone was
[21441.62s -> 21452.54s]  entrusted to a vicious ogre he's too strong for any mere mortal to beat that was the second to

[22366.23s -> 22368.07s]  oh that hurt oh
[22371.66s -> 22384.98s]  corn on pizza eggplant okay onions this list is horrible honey this is not even where's pepperoni
[22385.62s -> 22404.82s]  it's like oysters walnuts tom are you tomato slices on you
[22406.94s -> 22412.76s]  now give me a new list give me a new list this list this list is bogus this is a bogus list
[22412.76s -> 22423.24s]  absolutely this one's bogus hold on close that give me a new one is this one correct
[22423.96s -> 22438.70s]  i mean this one's this one's closer than this one was okay bacon yeah this this is closer this is
[22438.70s -> 22448.12s]  closer imagine eating a healthy pizza imagine imagine putting walnuts on your pizza i'm sorry
[22448.12s -> 22454.01s]  that's just that's odd to me imagine corn all right bacon here we go uh i'm gonna move this
[22454.01s -> 22460.84s]  stuff around is a steak i wouldn't put steak on pizza peppers i don't like peppers on pizza this
[22460.84s -> 22467.86s]  is this is chicken it can be okay depends i don't know eggplant nope broccoli on pizza is actually
[22467.86s -> 22479.16s]  okay um pineapple i don't put it on pizza was this fresh parmesan i don't know i don't know
[22479.16s -> 22486.07s]  what some of this stuff is mushrooms mushrooms are good where's pepperoni pepperoni the right stuff
[22487.83s -> 22494.31s]  onions are good parmesan is good on pizza i don't even know did this is parmesan i can let me
[22494.31s -> 22501.11s]  let me get the list ready spinach on pizza no thank you jalapenos i can't eat it i can't
[22502.25s -> 22513.22s]  why is corn on this list again i'm so just sausages sausages all right let me get this
[22513.22s -> 22535.62s]  correct um what is this tomatoes what is that crab meat no thanks that's bogus um olives and it was
[22535.62s -> 22550.82s]  this garlic or what tofu is it garlic or tofu the croutons what is this you don't put garlic
[22550.82s -> 22564.42s]  bread on pizza you guys put croutons on pizza it's probably garlic all right hold on let me
[22564.42s -> 22570.42s]  get this right pepperoni onion bacon goes up here chickens and chickens up it belongs above
[22570.42s -> 22576.90s]  bacon in my opinion broccoli goes up there uh mushrooms are okay i'd rather have garlic
[22578.71s -> 22583.83s]  then bell peppers is basic and it just tastes like water i don't like them
[22583.91s -> 22587.67s]  parmesan can go up here the tomatoes just if the pizza sauce is made of the tomatoes
[22596.20s -> 22603.22s]  i don't know this is supposed to be steak well i can tell you i'd rather have pineapple on pizza
[22603.22s -> 22615.70s]  than steak on pizza these are down here are either i can't eat them or they just seem odd to me
[22615.70s -> 22630.95s]  they're anchovies odd days no they're not that looks like a cut off steak no i think that i
[22630.95s -> 22636.94s]  think this is pretty close see everyone that's saying that parmesan what's wrong with you
[22636.94s -> 22642.68s]  parmesan's incredible parmesan is a great masking of bad pizza if you dump parmesan
[22642.68s -> 22649.62s]  cheese all over your slice of pizza it's because the pizza is not very good and you're making it
[22649.62s -> 22666.78s]  taste better that you don't have to put a bunch of parmesan cheese on a really good high quality
[22666.78s -> 22681.72s]  slice pizza it's like sriracha laughing my ass off that's incorrect it's a child flavor palette
[22687.54s -> 22700.98s]  because i don't want to put corn on my pizza i can't believe you put eggplant down in f tier
[22700.98s -> 22716.87s]  when was the last time you guys ordered eggplant on your pizza probably never oh yeah what do you
[22716.87s -> 22722.31s]  want for pizza okay if i'm the child then you're you're the person that nobody wants to order a
[22722.31s -> 22727.83s]  pizza with okay oh let's get let's get a pizza yeah what should we put on it how about eggplant
[22727.83s -> 22733.11s]  and spinach it's like get the fuck out of here i don't what i don't want to order a pizza with
[22733.11s -> 22740.33s]  you yeah maybe we should put corn and crab meat on it uh you can get your own pizza actually
[22740.33s -> 22750.87s]  well if we think about this i don't want that why jalapenos down here jalapenos would be up here
[22751.61s -> 22761.99s]  but i can't eat them anymore i physically can't do it anymore you know what i was thinking but
[22761.99s -> 22768.87s]  yeah uh instead of like pepperoni onion or like bacon chicken bacon or sausage or broccoli bacon
[22768.87s -> 22775.32s]  broccoli chicken i want corn and anchovies you i'm gonna just tell you honestly guys you will be
[22775.32s -> 22783.85s]  somebody that has to order your own pizza no one's gonna want to share this pizza with you
[22783.85s -> 22800.01s]  with corn and spinach on it and i don't i don't want olives i like olives i like olive oil but
[22800.01s -> 22805.05s]  i don't like olives like just eating olives they don't they don't belong down here though
[22806.46s -> 22818.79s]  i would probably i'd rather have olives on my pizza then yeah no no i actually wouldn't i
[22818.79s -> 22824.09s]  actually wouldn't mind it if it was on it i would eat it i don't love it i don't really like it but
[22824.09s -> 22838.78s]  i would eat that slice this is stuff that i wouldn't eat if it was on pizza pineapple is higher
[22838.78s -> 22848.17s]  than spinach i mean yeah you've never had spinach on pizza then oh i have i have it's great when you
[22848.17s -> 22853.53s]  bite into a slice of spinach on it and the spinach comes off and peels off like the lid of a yogurt
[22854.33s -> 22866.89s]  and it's like it's stuck on your mouth and somebody i know at least a few you know what
[22866.89s -> 22872.97s]  i'm talking about it's it's like that solid it just pulls off and like slaps you in the mouth
[22872.97s -> 22890.90s]  and it's like the shape of a yogurt lid pineapple on pizza sucks i just i don't i would say number
[22890.90s -> 22901.51s]  one i'd want i would want pepperoni or um peppers probably should be a little higher than this
[22903.64s -> 22908.52s]  because like peppers mushrooms like i don't i don't you know i don't think so i don't think so
[22909.08s -> 22918.66s]  i don't order sausage on my pizza ever i don't i love onion on pizza it's incredible though i love
[22918.66s -> 22929.59s]  onion yeah i think that's more accurate if this is garlic then it's more accurate now it is no
[22929.59s -> 22942.07s]  it's not okay that's safe no explain your olive hate um i don't i just regular olives just just
[22942.07s -> 22964.22s]  tastes like acid to me they they taste sour and acidic olives are just bitter and gross i mean
[22964.22s -> 22968.46s]  i'm not going to say they're gross i like olive oil is amazing i love olive i put olive oil on
[22968.46s -> 22992.60s]  everything you're so based and epic for this you're so based okay you brown noser hey leave him
[22992.60s -> 23022.18s]  alone leave him alone just because they didn't want corn on his pizza leave him alone all right
[23022.18s -> 23029.27s]  you passed the test you passed the test okay you passed the test i thought if i put uh bacon down
[23029.27s -> 23043.06s]  here people are gonna freak out and i was gonna call you hypocrites okay more and more that i
[23043.06s -> 23057.48s]  think about this i wouldn't i don't order sausage on pizza i don't order mushrooms either on pizza
[23057.48s -> 23066.02s]  i do sometimes but not as much as i would get like that's accurate all right i'm done why broccoli
[23066.02s -> 23080.71s]  you've never had broccoli on pizza before it's amazing now it's done dog food why would i do a
[23080.71s -> 23105.46s]  dog food tier list i've never eaten it dog food derma tier list tier list wait hold on i'm not
[23105.46s -> 23117.99s]  doing this this is just this is just dumb like this is just bizarre i best hot pockets i can do
[23117.99s -> 23125.83s]  this one really fast okay you ready let's do best hot pockets this one's gonna go real quick
[23127.74s -> 23166.25s]  okay best hot pocket uh where is the meatball marinara where is it i know it's here somewhere
[23166.25s -> 23179.03s]  meatball marinara where is it that's it right there right and where's the steak and cheese one
[23179.03s -> 23182.39s]  it's like this it's the steak with the cheese and the peppers and the onions where's that one
[23186.34s -> 23206.07s]  right here okay all right why do we got to do hot pockets like this uh and it was a ham and cheese
[23206.07s -> 23210.15s]  was it was the ad no the ham and cheese ones right here right yep okay that's correct that's
[23210.15s -> 23224.63s]  actually accurate what about the four cheese no the rest of these diversities you should never eat

[23252.71s -> 23259.88s]  no no just don't eat jimmy deen's instead jimmy deen makes much better breakfast sandwiches
[23260.60s -> 23273.80s]  i would rather have a jimmy deen frozen sausage egg and cheese than a hot pocket egg and cheese
[23273.80s -> 23280.63s]  burrito thing people eat these i thought there was a meme no i used to eat these all the time
[23280.63s -> 23286.52s]  especially these three all frozen fruit is gross ah i don't know i don't agree with you there
[23287.69s -> 23296.86s]  it can be okay best oreo flavors i can do this one because hopefully okay if it's on the list
[23297.42s -> 23300.86s]  i will put it five times higher than everything else is it on the list
[23301.82s -> 23305.74s]  now this is an incredibly this is a terrible list for oreos is there a better one with all
[23305.74s -> 23316.50s]  the oreo flavors there's got to be a better one than that is this one on it nope not on it

[24784.09s -> 24788.01s]  your stuff has really inspired me to apply myself over the years I'm currently
[24788.01s -> 24792.01s]  interning on a feature film while producing my own short I don't think I
[24792.01s -> 24793.69s]  would do it I think I would be here without you
[24793.69s -> 24801.82s]  seriously man you do so much more than you ever know thank you I'm that's
[24801.82s -> 24805.86s]  awesome that you're on a set on a feature film set right now and you doing
[24805.86s -> 24814.79s]  your own shit the best thing you can do is just keep punching at it see if it
[24814.79s -> 24829.76s]  takes you anywhere you can't win unless you try there is what you ought to say
[24829.76s -> 24838.90s]  do or dude don't do or do not do or do not do there is no try something like
[24838.90s -> 24844.94s]  that right was though you know because a Yoda could do or do not there's my
[24844.94s -> 24853.07s]  yearbook quote by the way I swear to fucking God do or do not do do or do
[24853.07s -> 24859.74s]  not there is no try that was my yearbook quote from Yoda but that's not
[24859.74s -> 24866.47s]  even accurate what I'm trying to say what I'm trying to say is try what if
[24866.47s -> 24873.49s]  that's a terrible quote no it's not that's Bruce Lee do or do not there is
[24873.49s -> 24904.72s]  no try that's Yoda what do you mean Bruce Lee listen to Yoda listen to Yoda
[24904.72s -> 24920.30s]  Bruce Lee Vod instantly got deleted no no I'm not gonna even try it was me
[24920.30s -> 24945.73s]  doing that voice I could probably do it I'm gonna mute I just tried it like six
[24945.73s -> 24955.95s]  times it's not gonna work listen to Yoda though seriously Yoda's got some good
[24955.95s -> 24969.25s]  advice try do it don't or do it don't try try it do Yoda's voice I have a note
[24969.25s -> 24974.81s]  that if you think that I inspire you to do anything I'm happy that that's the
[24974.81s -> 24987.14s]  case I hope it's a force for good hey very nice thanks for the 500 bits
[24987.14s -> 24990.70s]  Jeremy sorry for missing the New Year's stream don't apologize for ever missing
[24990.70s -> 24997.62s]  anything that this stream ever does you under no obligation to ever be here so
[24997.66s -> 25000.87s]  don't worry I'm feeling a bit bummed out at the moment because I didn't manage to
[25000.87s -> 25004.79s]  get into an overseas study program that I was looking forward to now a bit
[25004.79s -> 25015.67s]  directionless I'm sure one where I want to go next any words of wisdom try again
[25015.67s -> 25034.54s]  try again but there is no try who said who told you that all right I'll give it
[25034.54s -> 25045.84s]  a try no try not do or do not there is no try all right yeah I have to go
[25045.88s -> 25052.49s]  against Yoda on this one for a second any words of wisdom for real though
[25052.49s -> 25060.26s]  without any like jokes or anything I would probably say to honestly to try
[25060.26s -> 25069.43s]  it again I don't know how old you are but if you have something that you want
[25069.43s -> 25073.70s]  to do overseas study programs correct me if I'm wrong they're actually kind of
[25073.70s -> 25077.66s]  difficult to get into because they only take a certain amount of students right
[25077.66s -> 25084.44s]  so it's actually not something I don't think I would be too too upset about it
[25084.44s -> 25089.64s]  because it's such an exclusive hard to do they only take like what 30 40 50
[25089.64s -> 25093.56s]  students a lot of times it's incredibly difficult and it's incredibly expensive
[25093.56s -> 25101.93s]  now also remember that if you do an overseas program you may have just
[25101.93s -> 25106.05s]  increased the amount of money it takes for you to go to school by you know
[25106.05s -> 25117.53s]  times three so they do a lot of good where am I going with this one what do
[25117.53s -> 25124.15s]  I mean I'm just saying that it's it's it's expensive and it's hard to do hard
[25124.15s -> 25130.97s]  to get into overseas tuition is cheaper if you live in America wait what the
[25130.97s -> 25135.89s]  overseas study program not going to college in another country you go to
[25135.89s -> 25141.98s]  college in one country and you do a study program in another country you
[25141.98s -> 25149.03s]  don't like go to college in the other country it's a study program for a
[25149.03s -> 25153.23s]  school that's in the country of origin I'm confused what did you mean by this
[25153.23s -> 25176.33s]  yo Yoda yeah Yoda what should I do all right thanks Yoda move to a country with
[25176.33s -> 25200.02s]  better college prices he would recommend get him what would recommend drugs no I
[25200.02s -> 25212.08s]  really wish I had something better to tell you but you can try it again as a
[25212.08s -> 25221.37s]  meme no no carefully okay no stop saying ketamine what is ketamine what is it
