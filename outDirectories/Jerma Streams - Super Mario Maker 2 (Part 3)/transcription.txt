[0.70s -> 14.55s]  Hey, my headphones aren't in. No, they are. Well, now I can hear you. Sorry, I couldn't hear you.
[15.27s -> 30.23s]  I can hear you now. Welcome back. How's everybody doing? Are you doing good? Cool. How do you submit
[30.23s -> 37.99s]  levels for tonight? I kind of think we're just gonna just take them when I request them. You
[37.99s -> 45.19s]  know, like, hey, let me see one. I don't really have a plan for this besides just pulling them
[45.19s -> 55.91s]  out. Well, I want to do endless, not on super expert, but on easy. Just to try just to start
[55.91s -> 71.13s]  out. I just here's the thing about easy. So it's endless mode. How would you just play forever? If
[71.13s -> 75.93s]  you did it on easy? Is it okay? Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't easy? Like jump on the
[75.93s -> 84.79s]  turtle's head and then walk to the flag. Somebody's gonna do it. Somebody's gonna
[84.79s -> 91.59s]  just do endless on twitch for like seven straight days on easy. And they're gonna do like 4000
[91.59s -> 104.49s]  levels. There's gonna be a record to break. Is it gonna be me? I don't think I want that record.
[106.01s -> 112.44s]  Because first of all, you have to you have to do that. And then you are the guy that I'm the
[112.44s -> 121.37s]  person that beat all the levels on easy. Because it's what I was capable of. At that
[121.37s -> 132.92s]  point. This is gonna move. This is all screwed up. There we go. You got this man. It's all you.
[136.07s -> 145.38s]  No, I don't got this. But anyways, yeah, we're gonna do Mario Maker 2.
[146.10s -> 150.74s]  We are going to do Dark Souls randomizer tomorrow. Let me try to get it to work.
[151.62s -> 160.31s]  Today is Mario Maker 2. Dark Souls randomizer is tomorrow. And then I think I'm doing
[160.31s -> 164.66s]  something on fourth of July. I'm pretty sure Kim and I want to do something. I think
[164.66s -> 168.42s]  she wants to go out. So it'll probably be today, tomorrow and then Friday.
[169.78s -> 182.79s]  So we'll get these two days in a row here. Weapon randomizer, enemy, pretty much everything.
[183.51s -> 187.42s]  I want to do weapon randomizer, enemy randomizer, boss randomizer. It's just gonna
[187.42s -> 201.08s]  be it's a shit. It'll be a total shit show. So I have no idea in Dark Souls remaster.
[201.72s -> 205.13s]  I'm gonna do it solo. I'm not gonna do it co-op with anybody.
[205.85s -> 224.50s]  Don't forget about Resetier. I will not. We got a lot of things to play. So that's a good thing.
[226.70s -> 231.02s]  You never want me to turn this stream on and be like, I have no idea what I'm doing.
[231.66s -> 239.43s]  I've absolutely no clue. I got nothing. I got nothing. So it's a good thing that there's
[239.43s -> 247.98s]  at least three or four games that I can play whenever I want. That's every stream. What do
[247.98s -> 256.18s]  you mean that's every stream? Every stream, that's like one stream a month, maybe. I got
[256.18s -> 268.90s]  nothing. When have you ever heard me say that? It's been like a month or two. Yeah, I don't play
[268.90s -> 272.82s]  the same damn game every day. So sometimes you got to figure out what you're going to do.
[278.66s -> 295.94s]  What are you talking about? Me? Yeah, you. All right, let's go ahead and start it on easy.
[295.94s -> 310.06s]  This is the punishment. Okay, how easy is this actually going to be? All like jokes
[310.06s -> 323.94s]  aside, is this absolutely impossible to lose? I don't know how to fly. Yeah, I do.
[325.00s -> 348.62s]  Oui. Oui. Wait, it's supposed to be impossible to lose. Uh-oh, Hugh versus kicking in.
[349.26s -> 376.09s]  You can't lose. Happy Fourth of July, everybody. Hope you have some hot dogs and hamburgers.
[382.15s -> 401.59s]  I have the strangest urge to purchase a Oui now. Don't do that. That's only a minute.
[402.23s -> 412.06s]  That's a long time. All right, what's next? I like this. This is fun. Okay, here we go. What's
[412.06s -> 421.56s]  the next one? This is like a bag of really, really mild jalapeno chips. There's no habanero
[421.56s -> 428.12s]  in here. There's no ghost peppers in here. No, this is just mild jalapeno. This is like
[428.12s -> 434.82s]  the default sauce at Taco Bell. I like it. Wait, are you seriously getting a taco without
[434.82s -> 438.50s]  like the Diablo sauce? Sometimes you don't want Diablo sauce. Sometimes I just want to fucking
[438.50s -> 451.86s]  eat a taco. Look at this. This is delicious. Can I get like six extra packets of Diablo sauce,
[451.86s -> 476.28s]  please? No. What's wrong with you? Nice mild flavor here. Diablo sauce is mild sauce. All
[476.28s -> 485.24s]  right. Okay, settle down. I know that there are people that love to tout how strong they are
[485.24s -> 490.28s]  with their mouths and how they can eat anything in their Diablo sauce. Not even intense, man.
[491.58s -> 498.14s]  I gauge how much I like a hot sauce, whether or not it hurts my body. It hurts my face and my
[498.14s -> 503.42s]  face hurts and I sweat and it puts me in the hospital. That's how I determine if it's any
[503.42s -> 524.55s]  good. Uh-oh, uh-oh, slow go. Hold on a minute here. What's the middle sauce called?
[529.98s -> 536.44s]  That's a middle sauce right there. Mild. No, mild. Wait, mild is the middle sauce?
[537.24s -> 558.90s]  No, it's not. Is mild the middle one? No, it isn't. It's mild, hot, fire, and then Diablo.
[560.09s -> 577.93s]  Okay, right. Yeah, so hot is... Wait, what happened? Germany's supposed to go to the
[577.93s -> 591.69s]  right in Mario levels. To the right in Mario levels. What is going on? This is salsa.
[592.65s -> 615.98s]  That's not true. Some sauces can be really bad. This is V8 juice. The tomatoes can be
[615.98s -> 623.74s]  too acidic for people. All right, how long am I gonna do this? How am I gonna keep this up?
[624.30s -> 643.61s]  In a packet of frosting. Oh, RT Game Crowd coming in for the ride! What's up, man? Thank
[643.61s -> 652.20s]  you. Just started, too. You guys are just in time. I don't know what you were just
[652.28s -> 660.52s]  claiming, but hopefully it was fun. Welcome, everybody. Thank you, RT. Are you doing Mario Maker?
[661.16s -> 666.55s]  What's your... All right, RT, if you're here, what's your favorite... How did I... I just got,
[666.55s -> 674.78s]  I got tripled right there. I couldn't even move. This little salsa's got some
[674.78s -> 683.18s]  fucking kick to it. No, no, no, no, no. These guys, these guys, this is honest,
[683.18s -> 687.82s]  but there was a bone in my fucking salsa, okay? It has nothing to do with how hot it is.
[687.82s -> 699.45s]  I just like... I picked a fucking bone out. No, shit. God, I'll get his bones everywhere.
[710.71s -> 737.21s]  All right, am I gonna get bones? Not too bad. Died to vegan almond milk. I did not. That's not
[737.21s -> 749.67s]  what that was. That's tricky. All right, this is not even an easy level. You just have to
[749.67s -> 757.70s]  pick a door. This is gonna bring me all the way back to the level. No, this shit don't
[757.70s -> 770.71s]  count. Does it count when the waiter sneezes in your food? No. No, god damn it, I was trying
[770.71s -> 778.81s]  to go... I'm still eating it though. I'm still eating the food. I'm putting it in my mouth.
[783.24s -> 792.33s]  Just skip it. You won't let me skip it. Oh my god, what a nightmare. Same pipe joke.
[796.86s -> 800.92s]  All right, which... I'm trying to see which one it is. Which one's going this one?
[801.56s -> 815.14s]  It's both of them, doesn't it? What's wrong with you? I drank a bunch of milk earlier.
[821.61s -> 825.93s]  I definitely shouldn't have done that. All right, I'm not doing this anymore. I want some...
[825.93s -> 832.95s]  I want some better salsa. All right, let's go to... Let's... Anybody got anything fun?
[840.92s -> 852.01s]  What's a decent one? All right, I'm gonna pick this one. Let's see what this one is.
[852.65s -> 860.07s]  Yeah, when I call for them, I'm just gonna use them. So this is TXPX3G.
[876.81s -> 883.10s]  Okay, searching for courses. This is called Extreme Desert Bus.
[889.72s -> 903.32s]  All right, 0.3% people have completed this. This is a speedrun. Reach the goal in a Koopa
[903.32s -> 923.66s]  trooper car. Okay, but check far, far forward. Check it. No. All right. Just... All right,
[923.66s -> 940.01s]  here we go. Really? Was that gonna hit my head? No. What? How do you get over this?
[940.81s -> 977.18s]  I have to jump on top of this and then... What? It's gone. Do I get another car? How the
[977.18s -> 984.30s]  hell are you supposed to do this? You gotta be going fast. All right, I got... I understand
[984.30s -> 1006.30s]  what it wants me to do here. All right, hold on. I got it. Ow. Damn it. I can't... Do I get a
[1006.30s -> 1045.02s]  second car? All right, here we go. Nice. Wait. Oh, fuck. I did it. There's a car right there.
[1060.98s -> 1085.66s]  Desert bus. Desert jog. More like it. Looks good so far. I wonder if I'm gonna get another
[1085.66s -> 1109.02s]  car. Do I need a mushroom? That's not good. That's not good. Oh, no. I have to have the car.
[1109.74s -> 1113.18s]  Well, how am I supposed to make that jump? This is just getting over it.
[1122.82s -> 1133.46s]  Damn it. You can only bump the car like three times. I'm gonna get stuck here for like a half
[1133.46s -> 1148.39s]  an hour just trying to do this one jump. Oh, I just had it. Okay, you have to go tap, tap.
[1149.19s -> 1164.12s]  Ready? Okay. Can I make the whole thing? Imagine people actually speed running this. Holy shit,
[1164.12s -> 1172.73s]  this would be ridiculous. It's gone. Gone. You gotta be perfect or it's not gonna happen.
[1187.85s -> 1211.69s]  Shit. Shit. Shit. I don't have to go fast. No. Stop bouncing off a wall.
[1215.26s -> 1238.78s]  Ooh. All right, now what? Holy shit. No! I can do it. I can do it. I just gotta be more
[1238.78s -> 1256.87s]  careful. Slow down. Don't be an idiot. Ow, my head. I used to have bunk beds with my brother
[1256.87s -> 1263.29s]  around. I used to do that all the fucking time. I might do it already. By the way,
[1263.29s -> 1268.22s]  top bunk sucks. You have a bad dream and you wake up and you end up in the fucking ER
[1268.22s -> 1279.93s]  and you smash your head against the ceiling. Just do it again. Just do it again. Do it again.
[1279.93s -> 1285.40s]  No, top bunk is not good because every time you're in the top bunk,
[1286.28s -> 1290.36s]  when you close your eyes and you fall asleep and then you wake up in the morning whenever,
[1291.56s -> 1295.80s]  your face is just three inches away from the ceiling and you're just like,
[1297.32s -> 1309.69s]  every single time you have a mini panic attack and you can't be too panicky because if you're
[1309.69s -> 1312.73s]  too panicky, you're gonna freak out and bump your face and break your nose.
[1320.82s -> 1324.58s]  All right, we're good. We're good. What about up here? Secret? Yep.
[1330.94s -> 1355.83s]  Damn it. I thought I had it clean. No, not clean. Clean it up. No, top bunk is never fun.
[1355.83s -> 1379.29s]  It really isn't. Shit. And bottom bunk is, bunk beds all suck. There is no good bunk bed
[1379.29s -> 1383.85s]  because guess what? You've got, if you're on the bottom bunk, you've got a potential fucking
[1383.85s -> 1388.33s]  landslide hazard of the person above you collapsing on top of you and crushing you.
[1391.70s -> 1397.06s]  Sometimes, I remember, I had the bottom bunk before and you'll hear the person above you
[1397.06s -> 1402.10s]  rolling around like freaking and shit and you're like, this thing's gonna fall and
[1402.10s -> 1408.28s]  pancake me. I'm dead. I don't want somebody right above me, like 300 fucking pounds above me.
[1409.24s -> 1421.66s]  That thing is gonna crush you like the Terminator. Not yet. Not to mention,
[1421.66s -> 1426.30s]  what if somebody like pisses the bed? You're gonna get sprinkled on. Pee isn't
[1426.30s -> 1439.40s]  gonna seep through that mattress and hit you right in the head. There it is. Up. No.
[1451.78s -> 1459.00s]  No, bunk beds are not. I don't like that. All right, I'm back here.
[1459.96s -> 1467.94s]  Easy. Gentle. Gentle. Gentle. Okay, here it is. I'm out. I'm dead. You gotta be going faster than
[1467.94s -> 1470.98s]  that. Oh, I'm gonna get addicted to this level and I'm gonna fucking sit here all night.
[1472.34s -> 1481.11s]  I would rather sleep in a twin bed with like four people than have to worry about somebody
[1481.11s -> 1485.67s]  like some 400 pound dude above me in a bunk bed about to collapse on me.
[1488.52s -> 1492.28s]  I don't know why I'm assuming that the person above you in your bunk bed is 400
[1492.28s -> 1498.04s]  pounds. That person would be on the bottom, but you never know. Some people like at the top bunk.
[1499.56s -> 1519.98s]  Oh my god. Okay, I need to pay attention. Let me just, let me try to beat the stupid fucking
[1519.98s -> 1537.03s]  video game. Damn it. Let me at least try to get to that spot one more time.
[1537.91s -> 1541.54s]  This level is hours long. Well, let me at least try to get to the top there.
[1542.50s -> 1561.77s]  I didn't, I didn't get that. How did I not get that? I was touching it. Go up.
[1568.90s -> 1576.01s]  Ow. Moving to the rest of the screen? No, I'm not gonna. What's with this forward movement
[1576.01s -> 1579.85s]  and bullshit? Like I'm obviously going forward. Like what's, why is it hanging like that?
[1580.73s -> 1585.29s]  It's car mechanics. They need to fucking patch it. It's broken, I think. Here we go.
[1595.02s -> 1598.14s]  No, it's car mechanics. Car mechanics is what I thought. I heard.
[1599.42s -> 1602.30s]  I was on the forums. I was on Super Mario, Nintendo forums.
[1604.63s -> 1608.23s]  There's a huge apology post from Nintendo about the car mechanics. I don't know.
[1608.23s -> 1613.43s]  Specifically it was, um, it was written in Japanese so I had to translate it. So I might
[1613.43s -> 1617.03s]  not have the whole picture, but they were saying that the car mechanics are like all messed up
[1617.03s -> 1632.82s]  and that they were working on it. God damn it. Why? This first jump is so finicky.
[1633.54s -> 1643.19s]  You're wasting time of your life playing this game. This life. This level. You're
[1643.19s -> 1653.94s]  wasting your life. Don't remind me, Bob. Oh my god. I'm gonna jump on top of it. I'm
[1653.94s -> 1672.84s]  gonna jump on top. I wonder if that's why we're reliable, right? I can get over now.
[1672.84s -> 1695.91s]  You have to jump from this one to this one. I'm gonna try it. Here we go.
[1696.71s -> 1702.86s]  Trying to get this part clean is important. It's right here. Bang. Got it. Okay. Clean.
[1703.50s -> 1719.61s]  First part is decent. Shit. No. How did it just go? All right. Back to it. I gotta make
[1719.61s -> 1727.34s]  this jump, jump, jump, and then all the way. So we gotta do it early. Stupid. It's
[1727.34s -> 1752.20s]  not gonna be fast enough. Oh! What? What do you mean? How do I get that car? What? Does
[1752.20s -> 1771.30s]  he show up behind me? Hold on. I can't. I have to park the car in front of that thing?
[1775.94s -> 1794.30s]  Are you serious? He doesn't know? Tell me. Tell me. I want to know. I don't know. I
[1794.30s -> 1799.35s]  don't know. But what do I do? What do I not know? Tell me. Is it important? Is it critical
[1799.35s -> 1821.98s]  information that I don't have? Tell me. So park it. Shit. Wait, should I just drive over
[1821.98s -> 1838.22s]  and turn left? Turn on comments. Comments aren't going to help me, I don't think.
[1847.61s -> 1852.65s]  Damn. This is the hardest jump in the level right here. Just trying to get on
[1852.65s -> 1881.82s]  top of this from here. Pixel perfect. Pixel perfect. Pixel perfect. This thing, I gotta
[1881.82s -> 1892.02s]  fucking last any longer. Did I just, what just happened there? Did I, why did I just
[1892.66s -> 1902.26s]  throw the car like it was an item? What just happened? I just ghost rid the car into the
[1902.26s -> 1908.26s]  wall. I ejected out somehow. Oh, I know why. Because I leaned forward and my trigger
[1908.26s -> 1936.70s]  button hit the desk. Gave a rage. What the fuck keeps happening? Seriously? That's so
[1936.70s -> 1944.92s]  irritating. It's, what am I bumping? Oh my, okay, something's wrong. Something's wrong
[1944.92s -> 1948.60s]  here. Something's wrong. There's actually something wrong. There's something wrong.
[1949.16s -> 1989.67s]  What's wrong? Okay. Found out what was wrong. Good. Good. Good. The controller
[1989.67s -> 1996.65s]  wasn't plugged in. No, alright, quiet, quiet, quiet. I'm gonna get it right here. This is it.
[2009.80s -> 2028.94s]  What the fuck is happening right now? Well, something's, something ain't right here.
[2033.18s -> 2052.70s]  Well, there's sub only. What the fuck was that? Turns out there's only 30 real users
[2052.70s -> 2061.64s]  in this chat. That was fucking crazy. Um, settle down. What are you, what are you doing?
[2075.22s -> 2083.46s]  That was a lot of clapping. Yeah, it was. Now hold on. Now I gotta pay, I gotta pay attention
[2083.46s -> 2089.48s]  to the game. That was like, okay, that's the equivalent of you looking down and seeing 300
[2089.48s -> 2092.84s]  ants on the ground. You're like, hold on, wait, what the fuck is happening right now?
[2092.84s -> 2106.39s]  Hold on, hold on, I gotta take, there's ants in here. Start from back here. My god.
[2110.89s -> 2127.00s]  So, we're gonna have to keep it on for a little while. Just use the dev path? I'm
[2127.00s -> 2134.33s]  not gonna use the dev path. I will only use the dev path when I, you hear me say,
[2135.21s -> 2138.49s]  no, I'm not, I'm not doing this anymore. No, I'm not, this is fucking stupid. This is
[2138.49s -> 2142.33s]  fucking dumb. This is fucking stupid, fucking stupid. Once I start doing that, then yeah.
[2143.13s -> 2154.34s]  Once I start using the F word as every other vowel, then yeah, I swear to god, I don't
[2154.34s -> 2166.39s]  understand this one. This one feels like it works 40% of the time. How do you do the
[2166.39s -> 2178.97s]  jump at the end over here? You have to turn and then jump and then turn? Oh, there's
[2178.97s -> 2187.91s]  something wrong. There's something wrong. I'm gonna give this 10 more tries and then
[2187.91s -> 2190.87s]  I'm actually done. We're gonna move on. This is not gonna be one of those streams
[2190.87s -> 2195.03s]  where I sit here for an hour and 45 minutes trying to get through. It's not gonna happen.
[2195.03s -> 2206.49s]  Wait, I got this so much more to see. There's so much more to see. It is very
[2206.49s -> 2214.90s]  addicting though, and that's the problem. All these levels are just so addicting
[2214.90s -> 2225.72s]  because they're so meticulous and, all right, don't blow it. How do I get this? I have to
[2225.72s -> 2242.30s]  turn in midair and try to not flash. I crap. I ain't going down. Desert butts.
[2248.57s -> 2252.17s]  Nine more. Yes, keep track because yeah, I want to be held accountable for that.
[2252.89s -> 2269.93s]  Why does it not work half the time? No, I'm trying to think of an effective way.
[2282.26s -> 2295.21s]  No, why won't it jump when I land on this? I'm spamming the button too.
[2295.85s -> 2306.71s]  Ten Savovsky. Thanks for the 10 community subs. Oh, don't give subs. What are you thinking?
[2312.22s -> 2325.78s]  Don't do it. Don't do that. What are you thinking? All right, I'm starting to hate this
[2325.78s -> 2331.51s]  level only because of this part. Yeah, I'm sorry. I hate it. I'm getting there. I only
[2331.51s -> 2357.00s]  got seven more levels. I don't even understand. Oh god, I don't know where to go.
[2360.73s -> 2372.47s]  I, okay, let me try this one more time. Come on, I have to get over there from here and then jump
[2372.47s -> 2395.94s]  again. Oh my fucking god. Six more. I ain't doing this all night. I don't have this figured
[2395.94s -> 2408.55s]  out either. The creator of this level is laughing at you. Hey, dude, you made these
[2408.55s -> 2414.47s]  fucking crazy awesome levels and shit, but hey, can you make one, just edit this one
[2414.47s -> 2419.99s]  and make it like 10% easier and give it to me? And then I'll be like on stream beating it.
[2420.87s -> 2425.78s]  I'll be like, what the fuck, dude, this is so hard, but like, nice, but this level's
[2425.78s -> 2441.03s]  stacked all. Which one is this one? I don't know what to do here. I have to land and then,
[2441.03s -> 2459.03s]  but if I crash, turn before landing, that's what I was trying to do, but I lost momentum
[2459.03s -> 2475.08s]  and went down the hole. I have to figure out because when you jump, you just crash into
[2475.08s -> 2487.26s]  that wall. I do it every time. No, these stupid treadmill. Come on. No, I'm getting your tube
[2487.26s -> 2496.58s]  angry. What the heck's going on here? Yikes. All right, right here, jump down. That was it,
[2496.58s -> 2502.23s]  but I didn't jump again. My controller broke. No, it's not. No, no, it's not going to,
[2502.23s -> 2505.83s]  that doesn't work. It takes so long for your car to turn around, but by the time you turn
[2505.83s -> 2515.26s]  around again, you're already down the hole. It takes like a full second and a half to turn
[2515.26s -> 2535.26s]  the car over and go forward. I'm just going to crash into the wall. You'll see. This jump,
[2536.38s -> 2542.42s]  no, fuck this jump. Give me another copy of this, except like drop this thing here by like 8%.
[2559.35s -> 2564.26s]  Okay, here it is. I'm just going to crash directly into the fucking wall
[2564.90s -> 2571.80s]  because I obviously am not capable of doing this. Okay, that's one crash. Two more crashes
[2571.80s -> 2586.74s]  allowed. My God. See, you have to perfectly land on that. Turn left and then turn right
[2587.54s -> 2600.70s]  on the dime. Eventually, when the scientists can like come together to beat this.
[2606.57s -> 2617.53s]  Now I know why it has a 0.64% completion rate. That's probably the percentage of
[2618.49s -> 2624.81s]  scientists that exist on Earth right now. I would probably say that 0.64% of all people
[2624.81s -> 2640.62s]  are probably a scientist, right? All right, this is my last try. Last try before I skipped the
[2640.62s -> 2656.86s]  level. Wait, the dev is giving advice in the chat. Dev is giving advice. Well, I can't see.
[2660.06s -> 2672.78s]  There's a million names going by. Dev, but how can the dev, is the dev a sub?
[2673.18s -> 2687.10s]  He's like, I got a sub. This motherfucker's doing this all wrong. All right, so how do I get past
[2687.10s -> 2694.39s]  this first jump? Give me the secrets. You got to land on that conveyor, turn around,
[2694.39s -> 2710.92s]  and then spam jump at the end. Fuck. That's too hard. Spam jump. It's too hard. I'm going to
[2710.92s -> 2723.69s]  try it. I'm going to try to land, but the conveyor belt is so scary. Don't backseat him.
[2724.49s -> 2731.18s]  That's not backseating. That's advice. If you were to tell me that what I was doing was
[2731.82s -> 2736.14s]  wrong, therefore do my way, and that's right, that's backseating, but saying, hey,
[2736.14s -> 2740.46s]  like, you know, if you do it this way, that is what I'm talking about. So stop backseating me,
[2740.46s -> 2746.65s]  please. I swear to God, man. No, I got to get up there and try this one more time.
[2747.29s -> 2769.35s]  I have a strict don't backseat me policy in the channel. I'm trying to spam jump up here.
[2778.06s -> 2781.02s]  It's been like an hour. I don't want to do this all day.
[2781.82s -> 2785.58s]  This is the first viewer level. I can't do it. I got to give like a time limit.
[2803.46s -> 2820.94s]  Why? Why? I keep hitting my head on the goddamn bunk that I swear to God.
[2827.80s -> 2830.12s]  I'm of the opinion that you just throw dice in the air to get that jump.
[2831.50s -> 2841.24s]  Did you get a six? You get to go. All right, here we go. Time to actually get across.
[2847.82s -> 2854.22s]  No, you mother fucker. Why? God, why does it bounce so far back?
[2862.62s -> 2865.58s]  You launch backwards, always in that hole.
[2879.37s -> 2887.08s]  Shit. Oh my God. Like, un-fucking-bearable. Un-fucking-bearable.
[2888.28s -> 2903.02s]  This level was designed to make you hate the game. That's what it's here for,
[2903.74s -> 2909.86s]  and it's not working. I'm not going to let it work. Mario Maker 2 is fucking sick.
[2910.97s -> 2917.13s]  I'm not going to let some maniacal, maniacal developer try to take the fun away from me.
[2918.17s -> 2929.05s]  How do you fast-forward a screen? Well, there's a new feature on Twitch.
[2930.73s -> 2942.17s]  What you do is you have to, never mind. Rude. I didn't say anything. I didn't even say
[2942.17s -> 2951.27s]  anything. What do you mean rude? I didn't even open my mouth. He was about to say something
[2951.27s -> 2961.75s]  rude. No, I wasn't. Okay, don't screw it up again. I screwed it up again, but it's okay.
[2961.75s -> 2981.42s]  Okay, here we go. God. No way. No way. No way. Why did you do this? Why, why did you do it like
[2981.42s -> 2987.34s]  this? Why did you, like, make that extended by, like, one block? Why does he have to, why do
[2987.34s -> 3006.09s]  you have to do it like this? Why? The dev is in the chat. He can't quit. If I quit now, then,
[3006.09s -> 3020.74s]  like, I mean, this is his master creation. This is his master creation. Okay. Holy shit!
[3020.74s -> 3039.46s]  No! Oh! It was there, but it's too, it's too perfect. It needs to be too perfect.
[3040.44s -> 3049.99s]  Nobody's perfect. It was really close, but then I have to do the whole second half of the level
[3049.99s -> 3055.74s]  and I'm not prepared to do that shit. I just looked at chat because somebody said,
[3056.70s -> 3059.98s]  no, there is no raid right now. All right, everybody relax.
[3072.34s -> 3080.42s]  Even if I get through, even if I get through this part, which I'm not going to.
[3081.14s -> 3085.10s]  You know how much, I mean, maybe I could. If I spent another two hours here, if I would do it,
[3097.46s -> 3100.58s]  I have, if I crash the car, it's over. Things are going to split.
[3102.36s -> 3107.02s]  So I'm going to crash it right now. Holy fuck. Okay. Nope.
[3125.11s -> 3129.91s]  Um, so remember when we talked about sauces and shit and how I was on mild sauce,
[3129.91s -> 3136.47s]  where I was eating, like, a tomato out of a can? This is buying pure capsaicin
[3137.03s -> 3148.42s]  from the internet and putting it in your eyes. I, yeah, I, I just,
[3148.42s -> 3150.50s]  I kind of want to just go back and eat my taco.
[3151.46s -> 3167.30s]  Fortnite. Why? Okay. Why would Fortnite be here?
[3170.84s -> 3174.84s]  Somebody gifted Fortnite a sub. Yeah. You can gift anybody a sub.
[3175.64s -> 3185.43s]  Imagine if Fortnite, the Fortnite channel rated this stream. That would be so stupid.
[3186.07s -> 3197.98s]  All right. I'm going to get it. Jump down. God damn it. How do you do this?
[3199.16s -> 3213.16s]  How are you supposed to do that? It's not possible. I understand how that's even possible.
[3215.16s -> 3232.36s]  Turn and spam and it's been an hour. It has almost been an hour.
[3232.36s -> 3241.75s]  I'm going to give it at least, but this is, I can't just like give up.
[3241.75s -> 3247.96s]  Let me just get to the end of this. Can we, can we just fucking pretend that if I get
[3247.96s -> 3273.29s]  inside that exclamation cube that I beat it? Oh my fucking God. Why do I turn around?
[3273.29s -> 3276.89s]  Because the dev told me I had to do that because if I don't turn around, I drive,
[3276.89s -> 3282.01s]  it's a conveyor boat. So I drive directly into the wall and then I bounce off into the hole.
[3283.13s -> 3313.18s]  That wasn't the dev. You have to like land right on the edge and jump immediately.
[3314.06s -> 3325.85s]  Oh my God. Okay. I'm not reading the chat right now. I got, you know, sometimes I
[3325.85s -> 3331.69s]  think about this. Why would I, why, why would I want to sit here and stick small needles into
[3331.69s -> 3341.74s]  myself? You know, this is just, this is sticking like 5,000 small needles into my skin.
[3342.62s -> 3348.04s]  This is a whole game here. There's an entire video game here. I don't need to do the,
[3348.68s -> 3371.30s]  the needle level. You need to do the needle level. No, why do we have to do needle levels?
[3372.18s -> 3379.14s]  What happened to world 1-1? Okay. What happened to world 1-1? When everyone just enjoyed themselves
[3379.14s -> 3384.98s]  and I beat 1-1. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Now the video gaming in 2019 is, that's not enough.
[3386.82s -> 3394.84s]  I need to do world 1-1 blindfolded while you stick me with pins. We're in just,
[3394.84s -> 3418.86s]  yeah, we're in constant conflict. This is the last try, last try. This is it, this is it.
[3418.86s -> 3421.42s]  Everyone's going to say, oh, you're a quitter. I can't believe that. I beat,
[3421.42s -> 3424.46s]  I beat the last boss of Sekiro. That's all I care about. I don't care about this. I'll,
[3424.46s -> 3428.70s]  I will eat those needles. I won't eat these ones. Oh God. No, no, no, no, no, don't cry.
[3437.18s -> 3443.83s]  I don't care if you call me a quitter. It doesn't matter. I already had my 2,000
[3443.83s -> 3448.63s]  calorie a year diet of needle games. Sekiro's, I beat the last boss of Sekiro. That's all
[3448.63s -> 3452.47s]  I care about. I know people that haven't done that. Personal people, I know people
[3452.47s -> 3455.59s]  personally that haven't done that. It's like, what do you got? Come on. Can't do this one?
[3456.55s -> 3477.59s]  Whatever. That game's easier than Dark Souls. Oh God. How dare you? Oh, I did it. What do I do?
[3478.47s -> 3490.12s]  What do I do? What do I do? Where's the depth? Where's the depth? Turn? What do we turn?
[3491.00s -> 3498.62s]  Go in the box. What do we turn? I don't know what you're talking about.
[3499.34s -> 3508.25s]  What's wrong? When you hit the block? What do we, I don't, does it, does it come with me?
[3508.25s -> 3512.17s]  Drive into it. Go slowly into the box. But I can't go slow. Just working fast.
[3513.21s -> 3531.40s]  180 the car into the box. Just go forward. I ca-, oh! Okay. Now what do I do? But what do I do?
[3531.96s -> 3537.94s]  If I'm hitting one more thing, I'm dead. Is there a, is there a checkpoint?
[3538.66s -> 3545.43s]  There's gotta be a checkpoint here, right? Oh shit. I have one more hit and this
[3545.43s -> 3575.48s]  fucking model T is gonna fall apart. Ooh. But now what? Hold on. Ooh! Ooh! Jesus! Oh
[3575.48s -> 3609.86s]  my God! Oh my God. It's so hard. No, it's right here. What? How the fuck are you supposed to get?
[3609.86s -> 3616.26s]  You, really? Really? Like, no. No way. Uh-uh. I ain't going over any more cakes. No,
[3616.26s -> 3619.46s]  fuck these cakes. I'm not doing it anymore. I'm not doing any fucking vanilla frosting
[3619.46s -> 3652.97s]  bullshit. I'm out. I need a fresh car going in there. Fresh car. All right. How did I do
[3652.97s -> 3657.05s]  this last time? You have to jump like up and then I don't even know. It was dumb luck.
[3658.17s -> 3677.38s]  Broken clock is right twice a day. And I can't even do this shit. Here we go. No, it was,
[3677.38s -> 3682.58s]  I, I, I can do it. I know I can. I can do it. Not if it's a digital clock. But if you,
[3682.58s -> 3688.86s]  yeah. But it's, I'm talking about an analog clock. It's been an hour, but it's all right.
[3688.86s -> 3707.64s]  This is like, this is, it's just, I'm, I'm, I'm in it. I'm getting pretty good at this
[3707.64s -> 3717.53s]  part. I just got to nail this down. You got to do it early, early. Oh, fuck me in
[3720.25s -> 3722.49s]  You got to jump high and then turn and then jump.
[3755.45s -> 3776.62s]  You fucking asshole. Oh, I just, it's like anything else. Once you get to a certain point,
[3776.62s -> 3783.18s]  your brain just refuses to let you leave because it's some cost fallacy, but it's
[3783.18s -> 3794.02s]  not even sunk cost because I've seen some, I've seen some progress. Okay. If I was driving into
[3794.02s -> 3798.82s]  this first wall over and over again, maybe, but I, I got up there. I just want to see,
[3798.82s -> 3805.82s]  I want to do it. I want to be the 0.6% of people that have done it. I can do it.
[3806.38s -> 3824.09s]  Still in Anor Londo, but we don't care. I care. This is a personal goal for me.
[3836.15s -> 3860.41s]  Yeah, slow down. Oh, it's too hard. Whatever. People are going to call me out. I don't,
[3860.41s -> 3866.09s]  doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. Hey, you know why? You know what? Hey, I'll tell you why I
[3866.09s -> 3872.01s]  don't care. This is why I don't care. Cause 0.64% of people have beaten it. So if this 3,600
[3872.01s -> 3876.09s]  people watching this, like only, only like eight of you have done this. So I don't care.
[3877.05s -> 3904.07s]  That doesn't bother me at all. I'm out. It hurts, but I can't just,
[3904.07s -> 3929.72s]  ugh. I want to beat it so bad. I'm going back to that later. What's this one? Let's try this
[3929.72s -> 3961.62s]  one. Okay. This one is 130, no, 130. VG2, M9G. The dev is proud of you? Well, he'll be,
[3961.62s -> 3966.02s]  you'll be even more proud of me when I beat it. This is called Bowser's Challenge.
[3967.40s -> 3975.10s]  I'm the first one to play this one. And it says kinda hard. All right. I'll be the judge
[3975.10s -> 3981.18s]  of that. I am the guy that got a fourth of the way through. Um, I don't even remember
[3981.18s -> 3997.10s]  the name of the level because it was still long ago. Homing missiles. Oops.
[3999.58s -> 4008.06s]  I'm so used to the car. I've only done car. I haven't done anything else but car. What,
[4008.06s -> 4031.27s]  what, what's that flame mean? Oh, no, I'm fine with cake Luigi. Oh shit. All right. So
[4031.35s -> 4041.80s]  I have to, another hour. No, this one's just says kinda hard. I see the fire now.
[4042.60s -> 4046.81s]  I gotta blow this up. I can't kill him. So we gotta blow this up.
[4049.05s -> 4066.70s]  Holy shit. Okay. This is, I'll get there. Oh, okay. Hold on. Slow down. Slow down.
[4069.21s -> 4078.52s]  Holy shit. I had it. Oh, I've had too much coffee today. I need to like, how do you get
[4078.52s -> 4092.28s]  reverse coffee? All right. Watch it. Kinda hard. This could be, this could be fire.
[4092.92s -> 4105.29s]  I don't know what's up here. Yep. I told you. So we got, all right. Uh, we got,
[4106.01s -> 4115.35s]  they go back and forth. There is a flame there. I'm going to go now and then, oh shit. Um,
[4115.35s -> 4121.56s]  go now? Go now? Now? And then what's the, what's the, what's the, wait. Up and over.
[4122.63s -> 4126.71s]  Follow the cubes. Holy fuck. Where do I go now? Oh my God.
[4131.53s -> 4151.98s]  Man. Give me another one. All right. That's not, that actually sucks. That's going to be annoying
[4152.70s -> 4169.82s]  because I just got lucky. Wait. Now I gotta go easy. Jump over the first one. Wait till
[4169.82s -> 4199.30s]  the flame comes up and then go across. No. God damn it. Let me try this again. I have plenty
[4199.30s -> 4213.35s]  of time depending on how long it is. How often does it come up? Dang. It's going to do it
[4213.35s -> 4217.75s]  again here. So like right now. And then I got hit. Okay. That's the one I got hit by.
[4218.87s -> 4225.72s]  All right. Same deal. He's going to shoot it out. Why did he not shoot it out? Why did it
[4225.72s -> 4229.32s]  take an extra second to fit? That was, that was like timed exactly from when I was going to
[4229.32s -> 4262.07s]  land and jump again. Out of my way. Let's go. I can make that. All right. Watch this.
[4262.07s -> 4269.35s]  Here comes the second fire. Ready. I have to wait one cycle here. No. Holy shit. Wouldn't
[4269.35s -> 4273.67s]  idiot. Okay. I'm fine. All right. Now this time. Here we go. He's going to pop out now.
[4274.63s -> 4292.47s]  He's going to stand on it. Got it. Now what? I'm so paranoid. Okay. Uh, homing
[4293.67s -> 4303.51s]  bombers. I see the tail of that fire thing though. Oh shit. Oh my God. Oh no.
[4304.65s -> 4322.25s]  Oh, I forgot that if you jump up that you stuck up there. Do a demon screech. Not that
[4322.25s -> 4337.74s]  I'm not going to do a demon screech. I wasn't even mean by the way. That freaked me out.
[4337.74s -> 4340.86s]  It freaked me out because I couldn't see where I was jumping. It freaked me out.
[4340.86s -> 4367.19s]  And that's what happened. I went too fast. Demon screech. No. When are they going to add
[4367.19s -> 4381.06s]  save States to Mario maker? I want them. He's kind of lost his mind folks. All right. Wait,
[4381.06s -> 4391.24s]  just do it now. Okay. I'm fine. Now here we go. This is, uh, just be careful. All right.
[4392.92s -> 4404.20s]  Oh, okay. Oh no. No, don't shoot. Don't shoot. It's going to shoot. No fall. Oh no. Oh no.
[4412.60s -> 4429.69s]  He's going to jump. He jumps right. He jumps. Does he jump again? Oh, I did it.
[4438.07s -> 4451.94s]  That was tricky. Oh, I'm so, I'm so shaky. Somebody did it in 44 seconds. Sorry. It's
[4452.90s -> 4464.68s]  4% completion rate. There's like 50 people did this bongo man's the only other person that did
[4464.68s -> 4477.30s]  it. Let's try this one. Brody and weapon. Put one in here. Let's give it a try.
[4478.10s -> 4493.05s]  Comments. Oh shit. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, back it up. Back it up. I don't
[4493.05s -> 4503.38s]  want to do that. How do I back up? How do I hit B? How do I hit B? Do I hit B? I can't
[4503.38s -> 4511.77s]  move. Is it B? Which one is make sure this doesn't happen? The big X. I can't move. I
[4511.77s -> 4517.66s]  can't hit the X in the top right corner. Should I hit? No, it's an X. Is it B or X?
[4518.98s -> 4529.34s]  Touch the X. I, I'm going to touch it. Okay. I'm going to. Okay. I got it. I got it. I got
[4529.34s -> 4550.63s]  it. I had to rip the console out. Okay. We're good. Where I can't see it now. Okay. I
[4550.63s -> 4574.44s]  didn't know. I would have been such a bad look. What a bad look. WDGQXT9PG. I was so
[4575.40s -> 4583.13s]  embarrassed right there. I thought that that was like going through. Haunted house car ride.
[4584.31s -> 4601.14s]  Okay. Here comes another car. It's probably going to be. All right. Let's go this way.
[4603.14s -> 4614.31s]  Here we go. Haunted house car ride. Do I still need the car? I think I need the.
[4615.35s -> 4634.22s]  Yeah, that was an oof moment. All right, Luigi. Can I? Yeah, you can just run people
[4634.22s -> 4661.24s]  over. How are you? Oh, that's the scary part. I get it. Oh, that it's a little trick there.
[4665.06s -> 4685.32s]  They make you jump on it. Oh, shit. Okay. It's Luigi's mansion. Luigi's car. Oh, that was the
[4685.32s -> 4691.24s]  joke. I actually hit the comedy part because he spits at you and jumps and you land on it
[4691.24s -> 4700.97s]  and it messes you up. I didn't even trigger the comedy part last time. So shoot it. Now we
[4700.97s -> 4726.76s]  go. Oh, wait. Okay. I shouldn't be jumping. Why do I die? I don't know. I guess you can't.
[4726.76s -> 4732.82s]  I thought for some reason I was going to be able to. It was just a bad car accident.
[4745.26s -> 4754.42s]  That's just. Yeah. All right. Here we go. They laughing at me again because I went.
[4763.22s -> 4769.58s]  I thought the thing that they were laughing at was the. Go on. Spit the thing.
[4780.87s -> 4787.69s]  Oh, it's a fucking yeti. Somebody found Sasquatch.
[4796.09s -> 4819.16s]  Stop laughing at me. Do I get double car? All right. I want a new car. This car is broken.
[4823.48s -> 4852.04s]  What? What was I supposed to do there? I just. You can't tell me you would have done the same
[4852.04s -> 4855.80s]  damn thing. I mean, you would not look. I'm trying to complain to chatter. You would have
[4855.80s -> 4877.43s]  done the same damn thing. Oh, shit. Here it comes. No, I'm good. I pressed it. I was jumping.
[4877.99s -> 4908.89s]  I was pressing V. Why? Damn, I fucking went. Mario. What? No, it's not even Mario.
[4910.54s -> 4931.83s]  It's the shitty green one. I forgot. Oh, I just made a lot of people angry. Do I have to take
[4931.83s -> 4964.55s]  the car in? No, let's do it. I did what I was supposed to do. Sick. Three minutes,
[4964.55s -> 4976.39s]  44 seconds. 13%. That's still pretty good. See what people have to say. I wonder how many comments
[4976.39s -> 4983.26s]  are going to be about me. Hmm. He can't reach it. That's pretty good, Jerma Hart. Plus two,
[4983.26s -> 4998.90s]  Jerma Good. That's pretty good. That was fun. That was a good one. Let's try. This is the
[4998.90s -> 5011.45s]  first one I just saw. Let's do this one. This one is one of the first ones I saw. Let's do
[5011.45s -> 5018.81s]  CDD. KHW. I do like that a lot of you guys are playing along with it. That's fun.
[5019.45s -> 5036.41s]  This is called MonkaS in 3D. Is there already a comment? Good luck. Oh, all right. I wonder.
[5036.41s -> 5055.35s]  I'll give it a try. Let's see. This is in 3D. That's right. Speedrun. What did I do?
[5083.98s -> 5097.40s]  All right, so you get a ball jump. Go get Bigfoot. No, Bigfoot's not coming out again.
[5098.28s -> 5116.81s]  All right, power block. What do I? He's just in the way. Um, I have to jump over this and then,
[5116.81s -> 5129.21s]  but how? Oh, the spikes come down. I get it. Oh, God. Speaking of spikes coming down.
[5129.21s -> 5161.80s]  Quickly. Go. Do the P. What the fuck? Oh, um, how do you get through that?
[5162.44s -> 5186.42s]  You have to let him push you to the other side? Oh, really? Oh, that's unfortunate.
[5193.94s -> 5207.58s]  Just don't die. Oops. All right. Well, let's go, go, go, go. How do I?
[5210.10s -> 5215.94s]  Ah, shit. Oh, my God. Now. Okay. You have to jump and then grab the side and then jump up
[5215.94s -> 5242.10s]  to the hole and you got to do that fast. Insanity music is playing. Yep. Come on.
[5242.10s -> 5264.50s]  Really? I'm so close. Got it. I missed a coin. It doesn't matter. It's not to try to
[5264.58s -> 5266.98s]  get every coin to try to get to the end of the level as fast as you can.
[5267.94s -> 5272.25s]  Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry. All right. We're good.
[5272.97s -> 5285.51s]  Cling to the side. Side. Oh, my God. Just jump up there. I would have just lost. Oh, shit.
[5285.51s -> 5293.34s]  Now what do we do? Up. Oh, no. The lava's rising. The lava's rising. Um, is it gonna
[5293.34s -> 5323.80s]  come back up? No. I thought it was gonna go the other way. Speedrun ruined, but whatever.
[5330.62s -> 5356.34s]  Mr. Spicy Dude, thanks for the five community subs. I can see them and I can still play.
[5356.34s -> 5381.06s]  Thank you, Spicy Dude. Okay. Do I need to jump? Oh, I need to jump over now. I have to go
[5381.06s -> 5401.54s]  down. So I was right the first time. You got to go over there as fast as you can because
[5401.54s -> 5430.47s]  it dips down and then comes back up. Okay. I just leaned to the mic to do that. That's like,
[5430.47s -> 5434.47s]  I'm getting to a point where I like settle down. You know what I mean? Like calm down.
[5435.19s -> 5463.94s]  Got it. That's what I wanted. Okay. Come on. Get down there and grab them.
[5472.78s -> 5488.28s]  This is how people turn into fucking animals. I'm turning into fucking Teen Wolf. This is
[5488.28s -> 5497.06s]  what it feels like to be an Animorph. Why do you always yell into your glass? Because
[5497.06s -> 5502.26s]  it muffles the sound and it doesn't peek and hurt your ears. So I scream into the mug
[5502.26s -> 5527.14s]  and nobody can hear it. How do I scream and nobody can hear it? Because it's muffled.
[5544.36s -> 5551.75s]  That's just what we call, what do you call that? A complaint in the official review.
[5552.47s -> 5594.92s]  I almost touched that. That was really close. Get up there. I swear to God, I gotta stop.
[5594.92s -> 5604.60s]  I gotta fucking, God, I'm gonna lose my mind. Can I just hold onto the edge forever? No,
[5604.60s -> 5671.85s]  you start sliding down, don't you? I had it my first time too. That shit is fucking insane.
[5671.85s -> 5676.42s]  That's actually insane. And then we got this shit. I forgot about this. All right, calm down.
[5677.14s -> 5687.42s]  I gotta make it to the other, here we go. Now we jump up and we go over now. Quickly, get up.
[5687.42s -> 5700.71s]  Is there another one? Oh, you! No, why would you do that to me? Why would you do that to
[5700.71s -> 5712.42s]  somebody? It was so, it was there. Why would you do that? Come on, that's just not fair.
[5712.90s -> 5726.82s]  This is not fair. That womp jump is so hard. Are you gonna kaizo block me?
[5734.49s -> 5746.78s]  Okay, now where was it? It was up and then, relax. Here it comes.
[5752.76s -> 5757.24s]  All right, where's the, where is it? It's like right up here. Trigger it, where is it?
[5757.88s -> 5767.05s]  Where is it? Where is it? There it is. Oh my God, you did it again. What, I can't go in
[5767.05s -> 5777.82s]  there. Can I go up? What's that even there for? Hey, hey! What? Should I, should I,
[5778.54s -> 5803.66s]  do I need the momentum to do this? I don't, oh man, oh man. I just freaked out walking
[5803.66s -> 5812.62s]  the thing. Off the spring, would a long jump go across that whole thing?
[5813.42s -> 5842.60s]  I feel like I would just hit the ceiling. Oh, come on. I'm so close. I can't just give
[5842.60s -> 5883.96s]  up now. I'm so close to these. What are you doing, Jeremy? What are you doing? All right,
[5883.96s -> 5899.35s]  kaizo blocks are up here. Go up one more. Why? Come on, I can't handle this shit.
[5900.63s -> 5945.00s]  Come on, I was trying. I was pressing it as lightly as I could. I gotta go up the right
[5945.00s -> 5956.71s]  side to follow all the way and go up the right side. Okay, why couldn't I go up there? Why
[5956.71s -> 5964.79s]  couldn't I go up? I was trying to, oh my God. You have to jump early. You have to go to the
[5964.79s -> 6020.84s]  right side early. What is happening? The Yeti game was good? What's a Yeti game? I'm the
[6020.84s -> 6028.12s]  only person that's ever died on this map. All right, well, how about this? I 100% guarantee,
[6028.12s -> 6032.60s]  this is a 100% guarantee that when I get to the end of this,
[6032.60s -> 6037.40s]  there's going to be less than 5% of people who completed it. I 100% guarantee.
[6037.40s -> 6045.53s]  So you want to talk shit or bring out the fucking Yeti. No, I'm not going to.
[6056.86s -> 6126.17s]  I can't even do this part now. And he's going to go full Yeti. He is. I stopped
[6126.17s -> 6164.68s]  that as hard as I could. Oh my God, stop it. It happened again. I was trying to stand on
[6164.68s -> 6169.96s]  the front and I fucking can't. I can't. I was trying to stand on the front,
[6169.96s -> 6183.35s]  but you have to keep moving with it. Oh my God. I'm trying to stand on the front,
[6183.35s -> 6214.46s]  but it moves faster than you can run. It just pressed it. What is the actual completion rate
[6214.46s -> 6226.81s]  on this? What is it right now? I want to know. Get the fuck out of here. Get the
[6226.81s -> 6251.03s]  fuck out of here. What am I doing? I'm like overthinking. I'm listening to chat. Crouch,
[6251.03s -> 6275.24s]  crouch, crouch. No, no, no, no, no. I'm just doing it. Progress towards the Yeti. The Yeti
[6275.24s -> 6291.06s]  is going to unleash in a minute here. The Yeti is coming. It's currently 0%. I'm bringing
[6291.06s -> 6306.60s]  out the Yeti. What happened there? What was going on there? I can feel him. I can feel
[6306.60s -> 6314.02s]  him just rowing. He's in here. He's trying to get out. He's like, I'm going to get out
[6314.98s -> 6319.38s]  a couple more times. You die in a row and then, you know, you look over chat and they call you
[6319.38s -> 6324.58s]  like a fucking idiot. I'll be out just soon enough. Don't worry about me. I'll be out soon
[6324.58s -> 6351.82s]  enough. And I'm like, no, you won't. Oh, yes, I will. Don't fuck it up. Okay. All right.
[6351.82s -> 6369.94s]  Here we go. Let's go. Let's go. We're in. We're in. I told you. I told you I'd be out
[6369.94s -> 6402.58s]  soon enough. He's no longer with us. It's just me. What the hell? I swear to God,
[6403.38s -> 6412.71s]  I jumped there. It was so obvious, but I jumped. This is what I would call that
[6412.71s -> 6425.62s]  bullshit for my neck of the woods. That looks better. All right. It's a jump. Here we go.
[6425.62s -> 6444.17s]  Oh, what happened? I'm playing still. I'm good. Oh, what happened? You couldn't fucking do it either?
[6444.81s -> 6452.42s]  Oh, you couldn't do it either, could you? He's nowhere to be found. Not going to fucking say
[6452.42s -> 6477.61s]  anything, huh? Okay. How do I make the jump with the spring? I don't get it. Do I just
[6477.61s -> 6484.94s]  not press any buttons at all? Oh, listen to my voice. This is how people lose their
[6484.94s -> 6511.90s]  fucking minds. This is how people go crazy. But how do I have to jump? How? I don't understand.
[6513.14s -> 6527.19s]  Do ZR? Like the Biahu? Do Biahu? How do you do Biahu? I tried to do it twice.
[6527.99s -> 6549.91s]  I tried to do it twice. I tried. I can't. These games. These games. This is why I don't play them
[6549.91s -> 6559.56s]  because I'm going to have to go to the doctor after this. I'm going to have to go to the
[6559.56s -> 6571.94s]  doctor to get described like time it all. PM. So I could sleep. I'm going to wake up in the
[6571.94s -> 6576.82s]  middle of the night screaming about the Yeti that's coming to get me. I'm going to have
[6576.82s -> 6599.93s]  fucking nightmares. Oh, what? Prescription for Tylenol. Do you like this? Is this what you want?
[6599.93s -> 6610.20s]  Is this what you wanted? No, I'm not going to give it to you. I'm slowing down now.
[6625.29s -> 6631.29s]  I know that that's a joke. Can you please stop dying as a joke? I know you're not serious,
[6631.29s -> 6646.52s]  but for some reason, for some reason it's infuriating me. It's making me so mad.
[6648.39s -> 6652.79s]  And I know it's bullshit. I know it's not even real, but it's like when you go to the movies and
[6652.79s -> 6656.71s]  you watch the bad guy do something bad, you're like, God, that's bad. That bad guy, he's a
[6656.71s -> 6661.75s]  mean person. You know that person's not real, but it still makes you feel bad.
[6669.62s -> 6683.86s]  Like in the movie, I don't know. I'm trying to think of a movie. I don't want to get
[6684.02s -> 6707.29s]  spoiled. No, jump. I got to jump. Fuck, stop. Fuck, stop it. Who had German loses on an easy level
[6707.29s -> 6712.57s]  on that? It's not an easy level. It's not easy level. No, it's not. No, it's not. It's not. I
[6712.57s -> 6728.14s]  can prove that. Yeah. Yeah. Twice in a row quickly. It's going to get up there first.
[6735.45s -> 6738.73s]  This is the part that sucks the most for me is just trying to stay on that first block.
[6740.89s -> 6765.21s]  What happened? You're actually watching somebody live on Twitch lose their mind. I'm
[6765.21s -> 6768.97s]  going to get to the end of this and I'm going to be one of like seven people to beat this level.
[6768.97s -> 6776.17s]  And I will be able to say that I did it. No more half skips. I'm going to beat this.
[6776.81s -> 6789.62s]  There's hair going down. I'm going to cut my hair. My hair's too long for it to play
[6789.62s -> 6818.09s]  Mario Maker because your hair gets in your face. All right. Oh, okay. Two, two, uh,
[6818.09s -> 6834.28s]  yahoos. Okay. What do I do? Should I go? I have 86 seconds, but what does this take me?
[6837.98s -> 6853.93s]  What the hell? He's coming at me. I can't fucking do it, man. It's not fair. It's not fair.
[6855.34s -> 6869.93s]  It's not fair. He's coming at me. Am I getting charged by a bull or am I playing
[6870.89s -> 6881.78s]  a Super Mario game? Am I ducking behind like a chair to get away from the bull?
[6882.58s -> 6916.42s]  Here he comes! I can't. I can't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm hitting. I'm getting hit.
[6917.22s -> 6921.86s]  I gotta get it together. It's hitting. That stupid fire guy that just didn't let me get it.
[6924.50s -> 6930.73s]  I'm not going to be able to ever play another video game again. They're all going to be this
[6930.73s -> 6949.54s]  level. It's breaking. I did the jump so good too, and then I got LOL momented.
[6968.60s -> 6979.42s]  Okay. Excuse me. What happened to the game? Because that was very- what happened? Why would
[6979.42s -> 6985.10s]  it not stick? Sometimes it just doesn't feel like sticking. I'm gonna start drinking.
[6986.82s -> 6989.86s]  I'm gonna start drinking. I'm gonna just go grab a bottle of wine and we're gonna win.
[6990.58s -> 7020.34s]  I'm gonna drink. Let's drink. I'm gonna start drinking wine. I have to beat this level. It got
[7020.34s -> 7026.22s]  stuck. Something's going- it needs to be recalibrated or something. I don't understand.
[7027.18s -> 7049.86s]  Take a shot every time you die. How about I take a small sip? And I mean like a tiny one.
[7051.14s -> 7058.54s]  Something's wrong. Something's actually wrong here. I'm losing it. Something's wrong.
[7059.50s -> 7065.75s]  No. Something's wrong. Something's wrong. Here we go. Something's wrong.
[7072.84s -> 7075.85s]  Waited too long.
[7096.71s -> 7128.76s]  You do this to yourself. I fucking even get by this anymore because I keep hitting my head on
[7128.76s -> 7182.65s]  the ceiling. That jump sucks. Oh, unbelievable. You only got to beat it once. That's true.
[7182.65s -> 7216.04s]  That is true. This is hair in my mouth. Okay. All right. Just yahoo, yahoo, yahoo, yahoo.
[7216.04s -> 7237.53s]  Not a big deal. Just yahoo. Okay. Go! Just hold right. Go! Holy shit! What? I don't know what
[7237.53s -> 7271.06s]  to do about this! I'm now an anime fighter. I just powered up and yelled my move. But how
[7271.06s -> 7292.94s]  are you gonna deal with this? I'm gonna fucking lose my mind every time I make progress.
[7292.94s -> 7297.90s]  There's another thing I have to learn and then die because the spring is gonna launch me forward.
[7299.11s -> 7332.60s]  Oh, there's new things to memorize every time. I gotta be close to the end though. If I do this,
[7332.60s -> 7337.38s]  I get there again. Then I just jump, wall jump a few times. It's gotta be like the end,
[7337.38s -> 7342.90s]  right? It has to be. You're almost at like the bar you'll make your limit for amount of
[7342.90s -> 7381.10s]  assets, right? It has to be. All right. Let's try it again. Thank you. Okay. Wall jump.
[7381.10s -> 7389.74s]  There's just momentum was so much faster. There's so much more momentum off the spring.
[7389.74s -> 7405.03s]  Oh my god. I should probably shouldn't even use the spring. Can I just like,
[7436.76s -> 7443.99s]  80% done if I get to the wall part? Oh shit! There's more! There's 20% more!
[7462.33s -> 7465.37s]  I gotta knock it out of the park, but I gotta get that jump correct.
[7472.14s -> 7500.33s]  Spring and then over the wall and then jump over the wall. Okay, let's go. Okay, come on.
[7501.29s -> 7509.61s]  Just right off. Don't jump that high. Just jump a little. Small jump. Just a little one.
[7512.55s -> 7516.15s]  Hey! God damn it! I can go up around to the left.
[7518.23s -> 7523.16s]  There's not enough momentum. I'll jump right into the...
[7526.14s -> 7529.98s]  I'm gonna try to go around the left side. That looks like a hey. Try this way, maybe.
[7552.81s -> 7561.69s]  I just wanted to eat like mild hot dog, but this is eating. This is like the
[7562.41s -> 7569.61s]  can't you eat 50 hot wings challenge. I went in here with like my kids. I just... I just...
[7569.61s -> 7578.23s]  Hold on. I fucked it up. No, I didn't. Thank god I'm smart. I just wanted to come in here
[7578.23s -> 7616.12s]  with my children and get... Okay. Yeti's gone. No more. There's a man playing Mario Maker to
[7616.12s -> 7630.71s]  switch it up in my driveway and he... I'm not in your driveway. I'm in my house. Take the clear
[7630.71s -> 7644.15s]  pipe during the snake walk. I can't. It doesn't hug the wall. I was thinking about trying it.
[7644.15s -> 7672.20s]  It doesn't have to hug the wall. You know what I mean? Like it has to hug this wall, right?
[7672.20s -> 7697.75s]  Yeah, see? I can't grab it. I just ran into that shit. All right. I'm gonna try going to
[7697.75s -> 7705.98s]  the left side. No, I'm not. No. You just instantly get bounced and you're just dead
[7705.98s -> 7712.22s]  if you don't go forward. You just die. If you do not go forward, you are guaranteed to die.
[7712.22s -> 7729.05s]  You have to go forward. You can't like just go left. My stamina is starting to be depleted.
[7729.77s -> 7772.01s]  I don't even smoke cigarettes, but I might. My stamina's at risk. What the fuck? No,
[7772.01s -> 7780.81s]  what the fuck just happened? I... I gotta move on. I don't think I can take this anymore.
[7780.81s -> 7785.83s]  I don't... I don't think I can take this anymore. I don't think I can fucking take this
[7785.83s -> 7811.75s]  shit anymore. It's like so fucking hard. It's too much. You're so close. If it doesn't matter
[7811.75s -> 7819.53s]  how close you are, you could drive your car a hundred miles and have 90 miles worth of gas.
[7820.86s -> 7826.60s]  The car's breaking down. We're gonna start to put the damn thing in neutral and fucking
[7826.60s -> 7869.06s]  start pushing me. All right. I'm just gonna try to wall jump. I'm gonna just try. Here we go.
[7869.06s -> 7897.96s]  Here we go. Fuck. Now what? How do I go from here? How do I go from here?
[7899.08s -> 7910.79s]  Huh? What does he want me to do now? But what do I... What do you want me to do now?
[7914.17s -> 7928.46s]  I don't understand. Oh, wait, I understand. I understand. Did I make it? Did I make it?
[7931.22s -> 7936.95s]  Do I drive the car over this way? Did I make it?
[7937.91s -> 7997.29s]  Oh! This goofy falling off the cliff. Oh my god. This goofy falling off the cliff.
[7997.29s -> 8007.83s]  But he's covered in fire ants. Oh, come on. I had it. I can do it. I know what to do now.
[8011.13s -> 8015.05s]  Dude, that was about... That was probably the most embarrassing noise I've ever made
[8015.61s -> 8023.34s]  on camera. I really think so. It could be. That was really fucking embarrassingly loud
[8023.34s -> 8029.34s]  and weird and fucking strange. I'm not proud of that at all. Not at all.
[8030.38s -> 8038.15s]  Nothing about that is what I'm proud of. And I get to go around again.
[8038.87s -> 8055.51s]  And it goes faster the second time. Okay. Oh my god. I did that. I beat this part on all
[8055.51s -> 8063.35s]  adrenaline after this. And now... And now I have to do it again. Oh, I don't even know
[8063.35s -> 8089.51s]  if I'm going to be able to. No, I'm not! So defeated. I can do it. I know I can. Fuck.
[8089.51s -> 8095.91s]  But I'm sorry. I'm sorry this has taken so long. And I'm sorry that you're... Oh. Now
[8095.91s -> 8103.67s]  my proudest moment. Okay. Calm down. I can do it. It's not that bad. It's just precision
[8103.67s -> 8115.00s]  and just patience and... I can't believe it. I thought I was going to be able to move on
[8115.00s -> 8124.20s]  finally, but we're still here. That was the one. I can't believe I... But what do you
[8124.20s -> 8133.50s]  do there? I hit my head? I have to jump out of the car. I think that you hit the top
[8133.50s -> 8160.41s]  and then you jump out of the car. That makes sense to me. I'll try. All right.
[8160.41s -> 8177.74s]  Try it again. This part's the one that just rocks at me. Just don't jump. You just kind
[8178.30s -> 8188.09s]  of have to panic. Let's see what happens. I tried. I tried. I didn't jump. It didn't
[8188.09s -> 8199.64s]  jump. It didn't go forward fast enough. Oh my god. Guys. Guys. I just a little jump,
[8199.64s -> 8207.66s]  but it's just a little one. I think I've died two or three hundred times on this
[8207.66s -> 8212.54s]  level. Anyone have any idea? How many times have I died here? It's got to be at least
[8212.54s -> 8242.49s]  two or three hundred times. I've been here for at least 50 minutes at least, but this
[8242.49s -> 8249.11s]  one feels way more painful than the other car one. I don't know why. This one just is
[8249.83s -> 8283.93s]  pain. The other one was not pain. The other one was needles. Super Mario Man. Little jump.
[8284.09s -> 8313.19s]  Little jump. Little jump. Little jump. Little jump. He didn't do the little twirl. I could
[8313.19s -> 8318.31s]  guarantee after this would go. I'm doing it. I'm going. Not even mild. I'm just going to eat
[8318.31s -> 8333.59s]  ice cream on camera. I'm just going to eat ice cream on camera and I'm going to do the
[8333.59s -> 8350.20s]  easiest levels in the game. I'm going to use one hand. I fucking beat it. It's coming back.
[8350.20s -> 8378.94s]  I'm getting a flashback of that moment. Two people have beaten this level.
[8380.52s -> 8401.10s]  Oh Jesus. No. I just wasn't high enough apparently. No.
[8405.86s -> 8410.66s]  I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. It'll be all right. Everything's going to be fine.
[8410.66s -> 8421.72s]  I just think I need to relax and just get it done. Oh, it's not okay. I'm going to get
[8422.36s -> 8430.50s]  it done. I don't think that's going to be fast enough. Somebody just said the word
[8430.50s -> 8437.77s]  jello. Don't do that right now. I'm so sorry for what I've done to your psyche.
[8439.05s -> 8448.74s]  Well, it's definitely good. Otherwise, I'm going to stop playing it. Oh shit, I forgot.
[8456.70s -> 8461.19s]  When you do something enough times in a row and then you start to just
[8462.92s -> 8468.28s]  wash over you. It just washes over you. Like for instance, I tried to wall jump,
[8468.28s -> 8491.66s]  but Super Mario Maker 2 sucks. So you can't grab on some time. What the fuck?
[8498.12s -> 8518.87s]  I swear to God, I'm going to be the third person to beat this level. I will. Can I get
[8518.87s -> 8523.38s]  like webcams of the other two people to beat this? I want to see your reaction.
[8550.81s -> 8563.64s]  Is there everyone that was telling me to jump in this pipe over here? Are you telling me
[8563.64s -> 8576.95s]  to do that? All right. I need to get a good grab onto the wall here because I've done this
[8576.95s -> 8589.18s]  twice now and I've gotten there and I've just hit that right at the edge. No, no, it wasn't
[8589.18s -> 8593.34s]  enough. I knew it. I knew it wasn't enough when I went up. I knew it wasn't enough. I knew
[8593.34s -> 8596.62s]  it wasn't enough and that's why I did it. I knew it wasn't enough. I just, it was wrong
[8596.62s -> 8603.11s]  and I knew it and I had to just accept it. It's not hesitation. I just wasn't high enough.
[8621.21s -> 8629.53s]  Even. I need to, I need to completely just like capitulate on this level and then I'll beat it.
[8630.17s -> 8654.84s]  I don't care about time. No, just step on it please.
[8657.24s -> 8669.66s]  Is it audio desync? I'll fix it later. I'll fix it when I go take my first break,
[8669.66s -> 8672.46s]  which will be in another three to four hundred attempts at this level.
[8682.25s -> 8685.53s]  No, no, no. That's gonna happen sooner. I just need to get it over with. I just
[8685.53s -> 8699.00s]  get it over with. It's all just math. It's all just math and assets. None of this is real.
[8699.80s -> 8703.96s]  There's no spikes. There's no fire. None of this shit's real. It's all math.
[8703.96s -> 8707.64s]  You just have to do it at the right second. It's just mathematics. I'm gonna do this one
[8707.64s -> 8714.68s]  mathematically and see if it works. There's no coins on the screen. There's no fire. There's
[8714.68s -> 8760.14s]  no Mario. There's no Luigi. It's just math. It's just math. It's only math. Come on.
[8760.86s -> 8767.90s]  All right, here we go. Two divided by four is two. It's three divided by five is six. Let's go!
[8776.86s -> 8819.83s]  Am I dead? Yeti bit. Hey, Durham, a good stream. PSP desert bus. I don't think I can.
[8820.79s -> 8822.47s]  My god, this level sucks.
[8822.87s -> 8841.54s]  Is that 56 minutes ago? 33, by the way. Thanks for the five community subs,
[8841.54s -> 8846.66s]  rip pepe body lotion. I know this is cheating, but I made this just for you.
[8853.67s -> 8861.96s]  You knew I was gonna come scroll down these. That was a good level. I'm probably 38 now.
[8865.29s -> 8868.33s]  All right. No, you got me. You got me. That's that. No, that's a good strategy. You got me.
[8870.79s -> 8882.44s]  TFP C7. This is cheating. C7H. Bim, bim, boi. Thanks for the five community subs.
[8884.15s -> 8893.67s]  Okay, now I have... I'm back. I'm back in action. I'm very fragile, as you guys know.
[8894.23s -> 8909.67s]  Let's do it. Okay, this is 38. I feel so happy. I don't have to do that anymore.
[8909.75s -> 8935.03s]  Oh, TFP. I can feel how red my body is. C7H. It's a one, not a seven. Oh, oh, the audio desync.
[8935.03s -> 8943.26s]  Okay. World 6-3, they're the rats. So the audio, the game audio is happening early.
[8943.26s -> 8957.48s]  Is that what somebody said? Let's see if that helps. You tell me. Ready? Should be
[8966.18s -> 8986.63s]  World 6-3, they're the rats. All right. Are they sing? Hiding in here?
[8987.59s -> 9015.27s]  Oh, this is a delicious, mild fucking run. Q-R-S-H. How do I get that? I gotta go up.
[9019.61s -> 9024.89s]  Don't kill them. I'm not killing them. I'm defeating them.
[9042.30s -> 9042.86s]  10 coins.
[9047.02s -> 9055.46s]  But yeah, so don't you know in every game that's not rated at least T,
[9056.26s -> 9058.50s]  these people are being defeated. They're not being killed.
[9059.22s -> 9072.17s]  There's a difference. What's in the door? Good thing I just touched that flag.
[9075.75s -> 9080.47s]  Defeating them kills them. No, it doesn't. It just crushes their head.
[9087.96s -> 9094.84s]  I love the rush. I told you, my stamina was deflated. My body, my soul left my body.
[9094.84s -> 9104.26s]  Like for the last 45 minutes. I'm not used to slowing down. That wasn't on the head?
[9109.45s -> 9126.28s]  I told you, there's only one level I know how to play. Oh, it's because he has spikes on his
[9126.28s -> 9136.14s]  back. I get it. That's not clear. That's not clear by the... I didn't realize that was spikes.
[9136.14s -> 9155.06s]  I thought that was just a hairstyle. Oh my god, that's kind of tricky actually.
[9160.90s -> 9170.82s]  The conveyor belts are hard to be on. I know, you're right. It's just a math problem.
[9170.82s -> 9176.26s]  You're right. What am I thinking? It's just math. I jumped too high.
[9177.38s -> 9181.94s]  That's fucking me. That's fucking me. It goes back and forwards. I'm not using it. I'm not
[9181.94s -> 9203.70s]  doing math. Why does Luigi jump like 5,000 feet in the air? Damn, this part is actually very
[9203.70s -> 9207.94s]  hard. You only have one real spot you can jump and the conveyor belts really fuck with
[9207.94s -> 9236.02s]  you. I'm just going to cross it. Like that. Damn, that's... it goes so fast. I'm gonna have to
[9236.02s -> 9241.51s]  clear him out. I'm gonna clear out the first one and then go back. Because that aggro's him.
[9241.51s -> 9254.73s]  And then I'm gonna have him jump. Kill you. And now I can just jump. Okay, got it. Although
[9254.73s -> 9283.30s]  I'm kind of screwed here. Spikes. Oh shit. Oh my god. Too fast. Too... Do I have to jump over that?
[9285.59s -> 9314.50s]  Jesus. It's so fast. And then this one goes the other way. And I can't kill those things.
[9325.02s -> 9344.76s]  Shit. Oh, I almost had it. Gonna stay here for a second. Wait.
[9349.90s -> 9359.80s]  Alright, finally. I made it with a big guy. That hasn't happened yet. Oh shit.
[9380.31s -> 9396.84s]  No. No. I'm gonna have to go back through this all again, aren't I?
[9397.48s -> 9406.15s]  Conveyor belts. I hate these things.
[9444.28s -> 9455.46s]  This is just fucking... it goes too... it's going too fast. It's going too fast.
[9458.41s -> 9484.73s]  You can't even land on the ground here. Do I just have to... I'm gonna try to just
[9484.73s -> 9503.22s]  jump over the spikes. No, don't get hit by the second rat again. The conveyor goes the other
[9503.22s -> 9511.77s]  way. It's hard. You lose so much momentum change when you jump from these things.
[9519.19s -> 9555.93s]  Let me see if I can do this. What the fuck just happened? No, fuck no. I can't even turn around.
[9557.13s -> 9602.76s]  What am I doing? Jump. Jump. Oh my god. I know the rats jump when I jump. I knew that when
[9602.76s -> 9609.74s]  I first walked in the door. You don't think I knew that? You think it's taken me this long
[9609.74s -> 9616.84s]  to figure that out? I'm turning into the fucking air conditioner from Brave Little Toaster.
[9618.04s -> 9648.71s]  I'm back. Hi, guys. You can't do that shit. You can't even go there. It just automatically...
[9649.59s -> 9682.49s]  You see what I'm fucking seeing? Just run underneath. You can't run underneath.
[9683.13s -> 9687.53s]  Did you see what just happened there, son? You can't run underneath them.
[9687.61s -> 9692.01s]  Stop telling me to run underneath that one. Son, you can't do it. I've tried it, son.
[9692.01s -> 9695.29s]  I just want to... Son, come into my office for a minute. I want to talk to you.
[9739.27s -> 9766.14s]  I don't care. I win. I guess eight minutes. Now get out of here, kid. Holy shit. How did
[9766.14s -> 9800.49s]  you draw that? Medium heat, salsa, and chips. I played my level. These are so good. Stop
[9800.49s -> 9815.80s]  acting. What a bad comment. The conveyor belt is just fucking me so bad. All right,
[9815.80s -> 9828.95s]  let's take one from chat. Let's take one from chat. P... Hold on. There's a fish there.
[9828.95s -> 9849.90s]  That means I have to use it. Let's try this one. No, no, stop, stop, stop. P-T-D-K-N-B-M-7-G.
[9850.86s -> 9862.78s]  Okay. What's this one? Mushroom and Men. Get the mushroom all the way to the end. Okay.
[9862.78s -> 9876.90s]  Reach the goal as Super Mario. All right. Sounds good. All right. No more screaming.
[9877.94s -> 9881.14s]  No more yelling. No more. I think I already lost.
[9901.06s -> 9908.92s]  Okay. I didn't know that. Okay. I got it. I got it. I got it. I'm not going to lose.
[9908.92s -> 9913.56s]  I just... Just wait. Don't make me get... Don't make me... Don't make me be dad again.
[9913.56s -> 9940.33s]  I'll turn into dad. What? Down? Oh shit.
[9946.74s -> 9955.48s]  Leslie? Um, what? I had to... I had to eat it. Come back. It'll bounce back.
[9956.20s -> 9970.33s]  And then we have to go across? Yep. Um, but then how do I get over there? Oh, down. Shit.
[9979.72s -> 9986.04s]  Yoshi, I'm sorry. Yoshi. I just like... I just like tortured Yoshi.
[9986.04s -> 10007.08s]  Okay. This is cute. I like this. What happens? Woof.
[10013.16s -> 10023.22s]  No. Oh god. I need a break. I do. I need to go like get a drink of water or something.
[10028.98s -> 10032.02s]  Hit it. Just hit the fucking thing.
[10040.02s -> 10043.14s]  You know what? Just hit it now. Hit it now where you have a shot. You don't have to...
[10043.14s -> 10049.38s]  This is just... Jeez. It's just my stimulation. I'm just stimulated is what it is.
[10053.66s -> 10090.60s]  What happened there? Stimulation's doing it to me, Peter. You fucker. You're in a simulation?
[10093.26s -> 10101.21s]  I think... I think I'm in a normal world. Why do you keep hitting the coin ones? Because
[10101.21s -> 10116.36s]  there's something wrong with me. You understand? All right. Here we go. You gotta be quick.
[10116.36s -> 10136.36s]  Oh shit. Go. What? No. What is wrong with him? Why does he do that every time? It's freaking
[10136.36s -> 10163.18s]  me out. It's making me so mad. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here.
[10166.65s -> 10177.11s]  Sorry. No. You're too... I'm too big. Why am I... I'm too big to do that. All right.
[10177.11s -> 10180.87s]  Yoshi can't come through there. Yoshi cannot go through there. He's too big.
[10181.59s -> 10195.37s]  So I really should just leave him. I thought I needed him for something.
[10199.27s -> 10243.35s]  Man. He forgot the coins. Easy. Easy. Fuck off, Yoshi. Yoshi, get... Yoshi, why did you... Why?
[10243.91s -> 10251.26s]  Just... Why? Get out of the way. I'm just dumping him. The second I hit, I throw,
[10251.26s -> 10284.78s]  I spit it out. You did that there. It's there on purpose. It's there on... It's on fucking
[10284.78s -> 10294.81s]  purpose that like this stupid spike is where I did a run into. Somebody just texted me.
[10294.81s -> 10300.17s]  It was like my mother saying, I'm watching you play Mario Maker and you really need to calm down.
[10300.17s -> 10334.23s]  I don't like this side of you. You were such a sweet boy. Now what? Get over there. I did it.
[10334.95s -> 10361.42s]  But is this not a puzzle anymore? There's a hard level. What's he doing? I don't like
[10361.42s -> 10375.64s]  that. I don't like this. Is he gonna go up? Uh-oh. Okay, he goes down. Wait, hold on,
[10375.64s -> 10381.24s]  but I need to... He goes across this. There's another mushroom that I have to take care of.
[10382.28s -> 10387.62s]  I have to have him go... Oh no. Okay. Hopefully I can get this... Otherwise it's the whole
[10387.62s -> 10395.91s]  thing again. Let's go. He made it. Oh shit. Now what? Oh my god, what do I do?
[10396.87s -> 10411.02s]  Oh my god. What's going on? Oh, should I have brought this with me? What the fuck is going on?
[10413.82s -> 10424.46s]  What? Wait, how is he... What happened there? The blue... Oh, fuck.
[10433.53s -> 10467.00s]  Pain in the ass. I just tried to run by that. Here we go. Oh shit. I got it.
[10468.23s -> 10470.71s]  All right, so now there's blue...
[10476.95s -> 10483.27s]  So what was I missing at first? Let me just look. So I didn't grab the blue thing to touch or
[10483.27s -> 10500.82s]  something? Okay, here we go. There we go. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Now? Is that...
[10501.88s -> 10505.16s]  It worked! Wait, do I now take this with me? Do I take this with me?
[10505.96s -> 10515.30s]  I don't know what to do. It's gonna fall if I don't. It's probably already bounced.
[10515.30s -> 10524.14s]  Yeah, you gotta take this thing. If it's lying on there, if you use it, it's gonna just drop.
[10524.14s -> 10540.63s]  All right, well now I know what to do. See, mom, I promise. Everything's fine. It's not.
[10557.26s -> 10578.92s]  Yoshi, let's do it. You and me together. Yoshi. One, two, three.
[10587.18s -> 10590.62s]  It's a Rube Goldberg machine. Yeah, kind of. That's sort of what it looks like, yeah.
[10591.42s -> 10616.73s]  Wait till now. Grab the P and let's go. I gotta hit it now.
[10630.65s -> 10634.01s]  It was right there, but I thought it was ahead of me.
[10634.01s -> 10638.17s]  I thought I was panicking. I thought it was ahead of me. Shit. Oh well.
[10638.17s -> 10642.01s]  Well, it's right there.
[10648.41s -> 10650.01s]  That was a hair difference.
[10686.39s -> 10711.88s]  Is music making you sleepy? Wake up! All right, okay. I'm ready. I've prepared myself this.
[10714.60s -> 10717.32s]  I just have to wait till it gets across.
[10718.28s -> 10738.36s]  Let's go. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No. I beat him last time. Just relax.
[10739.32s -> 10763.59s]  What? Oh my god. But how would that... Wait a minute. Wouldn't that just fall down?
[10763.59s -> 10768.42s]  I'm just gonna walk ahead, but wouldn't that just make it fall?
[10777.77s -> 10783.67s]  I guess it would just go on top and then go forward. It wouldn't fall backwards though,
[10783.75s -> 10787.19s]  would it? This is the end of the level already.
[10796.95s -> 10813.51s]  It can do it. It's just slow. Oh, I don't know why. I figured it would just fall down.
[10815.43s -> 10824.06s]  I'll get stuck down there. Oh, Yoshi. You are the worst.
[10826.97s -> 10845.53s]  What happened there? I just, I did, I've done this part.
[10847.22s -> 10873.53s]  Stupid dog. You made me look bad. The one time my pixel jumped over his body.
[10874.17s -> 10922.12s]  You gotta be shitting me. Yoshi, move. I was gonna say, get out of here.
[10923.91s -> 10947.66s]  Too early. Too early. Too early. Too early. Okay, let's get it.
[10987.11s -> 10998.04s]  Mm. I'm so happy that I have to do this first part every single time. I love it. I am in love
[10998.04s -> 11054.66s]  with it. I call it classic pee pants. It's a classic pee pants moment coming up. No, the
[11054.66s -> 11068.01s]  fucking ice. I just have to carry. Oh my god. I just have to bring the button over,
[11068.89s -> 11093.48s]  when the stupid cannon shoots. What the fuck? Oh no, I'm so tilted that it's just that this
[11093.48s -> 11125.88s]  first half of the level, I want to just fucking tear it up and put it in a shredder. What just
[11125.88s -> 11138.20s]  happened? Holy shit, hold on. I just gave a trillion subs. Cyanide just gave 20 subs.
[11139.88s -> 11148.55s]  Thank you for the 20 community subs, cyanide. That's a lot. That's a ton. So I'm gonna do
[11148.55s -> 11155.00s]  this, but you know, I have to beat this. This is it. I'm gonna get it right here. Trigger the
[11155.00s -> 11162.58s]  cannon and then go. I'm gonna bring the pee pants all the way across. Trigger the cannon,
[11162.58s -> 11177.18s]  pee pants. Just run. Let's go. Put it down and get it. Got it? Holy shit, it's there. How do
[11177.18s -> 11182.65s]  I get it? How do I touch it? Oh my god, do I pick the coins up? No. All right, I got
[11182.65s -> 11200.71s]  eye pee pants. I was gonna say no way. Anything else happen here? What's going on
[11200.71s -> 11225.72s]  here? This looks weird. That was a fun one. That was a good one. All it took was 20 community subs.
[11225.72s -> 11248.36s]  That's all it took. See, I told you. That was clever. It was clever. It was. What the hell?
[11257.82s -> 11261.50s]  Some of you guys, I don't know how you guys do this in like 40 minutes.
[11261.50s -> 11265.96s]  Actually seven minutes. Here's an easy level.
[11266.84s -> 11275.88s]  Ha ha ha. Jerva bad. You didn't find the 10, 30, and 50 coins, but it's fine.
[11276.52s -> 11315.40s]  My turn. It's my turn. Here's one. Here's one. Report that comment. This is what the
[11315.40s -> 11326.58s]  feature's for, right? That's what the feature's for. I mean, come on. You can't, you can't do
[11326.58s -> 11339.11s]  shit like that. Nintendo's not, that's not all right. Nintendo's, that's not, that's against
[11339.11s -> 11367.69s]  Nintendo policy. And it's slander. This report will be sent to Nintendo. Hit the button. All
[11367.69s -> 11373.37s]  right. I'm doing it. I'm hitting it. It's inappropriate. All right. It's inappropriate.
[11374.09s -> 11398.52s]  Is that inappropriate? That's, that's inappropriate behavior. I'm gonna write,
[11398.52s -> 11415.42s]  I'm writing this off stream. It's too much work. No, it's not. It's just,
[11415.42s -> 11452.18s]  oh, I just almost turned the camera on. Do I, do I have to avoid comments now?
[11452.18s -> 11476.33s]  Let's try this one. Did I just lose it? Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where
[11476.33s -> 11495.13s]  is it? Where is it? One WB, P, O, L, G, X, F or P zero. One WB. Wait, what was it? One WB,
[11499.10s -> 11510.44s]  P, O, L, G, X, F. Bob-omb's begin their attack. Blast a hole in the command ship.
[11511.16s -> 11516.74s]  This is the first, I think this is the first like Mario 2, Mario 3 level I've seen.
[11526.73s -> 11544.55s]  He's my favorite. I'm gonna, I always do really well on these ones.
[11545.67s -> 11571.62s]  It's down here. Missed coin, missed coin, missed coin. I know you guys are saying that.
[11571.62s -> 11575.22s]  Don't, I don't care. Missed coin, missed coin, missed coin. See that jump?
[11576.66s -> 11590.50s]  What's happening here? Oh, it's an explosion!
[11598.86s -> 11604.30s]  I thought I was gonna get the, uh, the star, the thing, the roulette, the slot machine thing.
[11605.18s -> 11637.48s]  Nice. Who cares about that? Kaizo blocked. Kaizo blocked. Careful. Careful now.
[11638.60s -> 11658.31s]  That'll be it. Got it. I do, yeah, I did well on that level. That was a second attempt.
[11658.95s -> 11671.29s]  And that's a world record. I like that one. All right, be, be nice here. I don't want to have
[11671.29s -> 11695.08s]  any other bullshit here. I'm not gonna abuse the system. That was good. Good, good level.
[11695.08s -> 11703.56s]  Let's try this one. This one has a sad face next to it because I got it. I got it. I'll
[11703.56s -> 11726.74s]  do this one. FPD TF2 with star. Searching for level. This is called Baki Baki Bone Chompers.
[11727.62s -> 11746.50s]  A lengthy challenge course of ice, bones, and infested chompers, please help. Lengthy. Lengthy
[11746.50s -> 11752.02s]  level. All right. Changes course. I'm gonna have to deal with this asshole the whole time.
[11755.58s -> 11759.66s]  You know when you sneak up behind a cat and you, the cat is really not paying attention at
[11759.66s -> 11766.14s]  all, and you get to right next to the cat's back and the cat just like freaks the fuck out
[11766.14s -> 11780.47s]  and jumps. That's what just happened. This thing's made it to ice too. Oh boy. I'm not ready for
[11780.47s -> 11814.57s]  this one. No, wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Is there one? Does it respawn? I dreamt a lot about
[11815.05s -> 11845.66s]  it. So don't change it. I'm just trying to jump on his head. Mad because bald. Wouldn't you be?
[11846.30s -> 11879.43s]  I'm almost there. If I was. What the? Get it. Get up there. I got it. That's it. That's all
[11879.43s -> 11887.14s]  it does for me. I guess there's nothing else here for me to do. Just 30 coins. 30 coins.
[11889.18s -> 11902.58s]  I gotta go over that faster. I can't just jump on that, can I? I'm gonna need a lot
[11902.58s -> 11931.27s]  of momentum for this. Oh I slipped. I have to do momentum jump, momentum jump, momentum jump.
[11932.15s -> 11969.21s]  It makes sense to me. Perfect. Slippery shit. Just stop. Please. No don't don't don't don't.
[11969.21s -> 11986.87s]  I fucked it up again. It's just been so. I did that. I can't believe I didn't get hit by that.
[11987.51s -> 11999.37s]  That was a miracle. All right. Out of the way. Out of the way. They disappear already.
[12001.59s -> 12008.07s]  The speed. It was so slow. I couldn't turn around fast enough. It's all ice.
[12008.95s -> 12033.11s]  It's all ice. This is the swamp level of fucking Mario games. Oh my god. You can't. You can't.
[12033.11s -> 12042.28s]  Holy shit. Do you see how slippery this is? It's turned up times 10 slippery. This is the most
[12042.28s -> 12053.14s]  slippery any fucking level I've ever played. I can't do it. I just slid across the whole
[12053.14s -> 12065.70s]  entire level. It's a it's a times 10 slippery. That's like when you go to McDonald's and you
[12065.70s -> 12069.22s]  order a fucking hamburger and they put a joke amount of mayonnaise on it because you say you
[12069.22s -> 12088.90s]  want extra mayonnaise and they're like okay fine and it's unedible. I definitely have to
[12088.90s -> 12107.45s]  get rid of him and then. Jeez. Oh come on. Is there another one? Thank god. Even this is
[12107.45s -> 12134.49s]  slippery. I don't go down this. Oh man. I need to break him right? Can I smash him? I'm
[12134.49s -> 12138.25s]  not gonna be able to make this. I gotta do it. I'm freaking the fuck out right now.
[12147.96s -> 12153.80s]  Go down. I can't. Down's not gonna help me. Go down. Go down. Go down. Go down. You have to
[12153.80s -> 12179.45s]  go down. What? No I don't. Oh you fucking dick. No I was wrong. I was wrong. I was wrong to do
[12179.45s -> 12184.30s]  that. I have to go back in this. How am I supposed to jump to there? I can't make that
[12184.30s -> 12191.54s]  jump from that little sliver. I need momentum to make that jump. Unless I do have to land
[12191.54s -> 12207.61s]  on that tiny little pixel. No. Fix it. Oh see it's over. I gotta get up here now.
[12208.49s -> 12238.47s]  Move please. I don't think I can make this. I'm gonna try. I can make it. Okay I made it.
[12238.47s -> 12243.67s]  Now I have to break these. I gotta just have some confidence man. Just no confidence at all.
[12246.42s -> 12268.22s]  Is there a spot? Is that land? Am I gonna die? Do I have to jump on the bones?
[12268.22s -> 12302.06s]  Holy shit. Um okay but the arrow was pointing down here. All right what is there a block that I
[12302.06s -> 12325.53s]  missed? I I guess I screwed something up. But the arrow. Yeah there was an arrow. This streamer
[12325.53s -> 12339.80s]  is yuck very boomer. Does he? Did you see that? What just happened there? That's called a cat
[12339.80s -> 12374.57s]  like reaction. I gotta jump. Oh you dickhead here. All right so now I just have to go around it or
[12374.57s -> 12388.62s]  across it. I think I'm just gonna try to jump gently here. Well if he didn't throw the damn
[12388.62s -> 12401.85s]  thing I'd be fine. Oh no I gotta bounce on his head to get up there. All right so why would
[12401.93s -> 12452.34s]  I turn that on? Secret key was the key. But so where is it? It's not just a it's a leap of
[12452.34s -> 12489.62s]  faith but well maybe just walk off the edge. But why would the arrow be pointing down there
[12489.62s -> 12500.17s]  if there's nothing there? Try trapping the fire in the blocks? That's not a bad idea.
[12500.73s -> 12536.94s]  Just barely missed that one. It's actually really hard to do this just that jump.
[12538.31s -> 12549.72s]  I guess maybe I could get him killed. But all right so how do I get the key from
[12549.72s -> 12590.49s]  me? All right let's try this. I don't think this is gonna do anything. Is there maybe a
[12591.35s -> 12598.82s]  thing to climb? Okay that just scared the fuck out of me. All right so what the hell do I
[12598.82s -> 12611.37s]  get a P block this? Go on the coins down there and then there's probably a P block down there?
[12611.37s -> 12618.34s]  I don't have any idea but I'm gonna go for it. There is and yeah okay.
[12620.39s -> 12632.46s]  All right yeah well I'm gonna get it. I'm gonna get it. Of course you put it right where you
[12632.46s -> 12652.87s]  have to jump. In both places. In both places. Fucking ice. Bakken gave 50 dollars. Bakken this
[12652.87s -> 12658.04s]  is your level isn't it? Thank you for the 50 bucks you say. I'm so sorry I sent you the
[12658.04s -> 12662.60s]  wrong code. I meant for you to play this one. I hate this level too. I'm so sorry. Wait what?
[12668.34s -> 12684.15s]  I don't I think it's pretty fun. It's tough. It's tricky. That's a seal of approval to skip
[12684.15s -> 12689.48s]  the level. I'm so close though. I gotta get that key and then be out of here.
[12696.71s -> 12706.79s]  You can't skip now. Not now. Oops that's perfect timing. That was the that was the
[12706.79s -> 12724.39s]  earliest hit box I could have had. Okay let's try it again.
[12727.64s -> 12737.08s]  Ag is gonna be patient. The P is gonna. All right this also. If that's possible.
[12737.96s -> 12759.46s]  I'm not sure it is. Okay here we go. I gotta time this right. So let's go right when it's
[12759.46s -> 12775.78s]  on the way down. You bastard! It's all slippery! Where is it? The whole thing is slippery!
[12776.74s -> 12801.56s]  Oh every surface is slippery. It's so slippery. Come on. This ice is fucking ridiculous.
[12812.90s -> 12838.49s]  Look at him go. Give me the damn thing. It's the it's the one to the left. It's not right in
[12838.49s -> 12843.34s]  the middle. It's not it's right to the left of it. All right come on. I can do this.
[12844.14s -> 12848.50s]  I just have to do it right. Look at the slipperiness.
[12848.50s -> 12865.14s]  You saw it there folks. Dude! Oh everything is slippery. You understand how slippery everything
[12865.14s -> 12871.59s]  even the blocks even these brown blocks are slippery. All right okay everybody calm down.
[12872.31s -> 12880.12s]  This is gonna kill me isn't it? What's the respawn rate on that?
[12881.94s -> 12894.01s]  Should I just dive in there and hit up? What is that? Why are you doing this?
[12901.37s -> 12907.29s]  Hahaha drop them both or at least I'm gonna wait till you're on the other side
[12908.47s -> 12927.11s]  like that. Holy shit. Okay I'm over. Everything's fine. Okay slow down. Is he gonna he's gonna
[12927.11s -> 12936.50s]  continue. I'm not gonna make it. I can't make it. I can't make it. That's gonna hit me. Okay
[12936.50s -> 12948.89s]  I can make it now. Where's the key? Where's the key? There's another key. There's another key.
[12948.97s -> 12972.54s]  Oh no. Where's the other key? Is it a hidden block? Oh no. Do I have to kill him? I don't think I can
[12972.54s -> 12980.70s]  kill him. That's gonna hit me. I don't think I can. I can't kill him. I don't think he dies.
[12983.86s -> 13020.58s]  Shit. That's a little pixel at the end. He's dead. Man. Man. MAN! I got it. Oh yes. Okay
[13020.58s -> 13040.02s]  I did it. I'm there. Thank god you have a checkpoint. Why would you have this? Thank god.
[13040.02s -> 13047.83s]  I was so mesmerized by the super escalator. What is that going to do when I touch it?
[13111.16s -> 13118.97s]  Yoshi can step on these. Right? What's with the scary music?
[13128.36s -> 13140.55s]  Why did that Yoshi just die? Okay now I need a new Yoshi. I need a new one. I thought that
[13140.55s -> 13149.45s]  was gonna kill me for a second and I was about to be very sad. Do this. Just jump.
[13150.17s -> 13183.26s]  Okay this is just freaking me out here. Way too much movement. Oh this is...
[13198.50s -> 13220.65s]  Is this... No here it is. There it is. What does this do for me? Where's it going? No. What? I need
[13220.65s -> 13257.48s]  Yoshi. Well now I have Yoshi. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Okay. I have Yoshi now. Oh excuse me.
[13258.12s -> 13292.02s]  Okay. Come here. Stop getting so scared. It's not even scary. Trust me. Oh no no no no not like
[13292.02s -> 13307.93s]  this. Like that. All right. Then we go up. So then I gotta ride it up there. So where is it?
[13310.34s -> 13331.69s]  Okay I get it. Swing myself up and jump. Oh no. This is gonna take me up there. Okay.
[13331.69s -> 13356.84s]  Okay. Oh pig. So just... I did need Yoshi. It's a good thing I got him. You can't beat this
[13356.84s -> 13363.75s]  without Yoshi. Another checkpoint. Well you know let me tell you something. Thank you.
[13363.75s -> 13367.91s]  Because if there was no checkpoint here I would have quit this level. If getting to this far
[13367.91s -> 13378.41s]  and dying. Thank you for that. Two ways. I just wasted both of these. Just in case anyone's
[13378.41s -> 13386.68s]  curious though that was a complete waste. 100% waste of resources. What? I'm so confused. I just
[13386.68s -> 13406.38s]  gotta keep. Can I do it with being small? Holy shit. I'm fine. Watch out for those pixels.
[13408.38s -> 13415.58s]  Okay. That's the easiest jump I've had to do all night and I just seriously just closed my
[13415.58s -> 13433.18s]  eyes and just died. Well now I'm not gonna waste these. Try it again. Really I didn't make that.
[13433.18s -> 13444.28s]  How did I not make that? That's bullshit. I thought that was a tunnel to go into. Not tunnels
[13444.28s -> 13469.83s]  that turtles came out of. Chasing the goal until I die. What? What? Okay. Did you see that?
[13470.39s -> 13474.31s]  I want to make sure that people rewind that. Get a clip of that because why did I speed
[13474.87s -> 13480.31s]  up? Why did I go so fast? Why is it going? I don't get it. Why am I going so fast?
[13481.03s -> 13489.86s]  Well Germany because you have forward momentum. No I don't. Almost did it again but I
[13489.86s -> 13506.71s]  saved it. Okay one key. You know what? Kill that guy. How many keys do I have? Can I store
[13506.71s -> 13518.49s]  them? I don't think I can store them. Don't touch it. All right let me try to get through
[13518.49s -> 13525.94s]  this member. I can do it. No I usually go by now. I screw it up. I usually have momentum
[13525.94s -> 13531.50s]  here and I make the jump but now I'm all screwed up. Yep see? I told you and I knew
[13531.50s -> 13543.53s]  it was gonna happen because I waited too long. Watch out for this. He was about to just
[13543.53s -> 13573.99s]  tele-frag me. Am I gonna go now? Ambushed. I gotta go this way first. See when you got
[13573.99s -> 13577.27s]  that momentum you just go and you get it done. I won't get hit by anything except
[13577.27s -> 13583.21s]  for that one pixel. I told you. This bone shit's really done to piss me off.
[13586.09s -> 13600.73s]  I got- I'm itchy. I'm breaking out hives right now I think. Did I say that I was
[13600.73s -> 13626.62s]  gonna smoke a cigarette earlier? Don't do that. It's not good for you. I can't be serious
[13626.62s -> 13647.40s]  here. Good. This is gonna be hell. This is gonna be hell. Yeah I think so. I gotta
[13647.40s -> 13652.44s]  get that side done first because there is- I'm probably gonna say close to 100% no chance
[13653.64s -> 13659.00s]  that I will do the- this side last. So I gotta be confident and get this one done.
[13662.44s -> 13673.06s]  However I do. You know what I mean? What if I just don't spawn them? No they're gonna be
[13673.06s -> 13680.47s]  spawned. What if I drop their wings? I think I have to- no I can't take them up. There's
[13680.47s -> 13687.72s]  no way I can get them. Maybe if I- I guess I can like drop the wings but then he'll just
[13687.72s -> 13690.90s]  be on the ground right? I think I just made it worse.
[13693.70s -> 13701.27s]  Because those bones fill up the whole screen. You ain't gonna fucking do that.
[13701.83s -> 13714.36s]  Might as well just fucking call it quits right there if I don't make that.
[13719.61s -> 13741.61s]  I can go for a smoke right about now. No don't smoke. Why did it not jump all the way?
[13743.78s -> 13751.99s]  That was- the gas just flew up out of my body. I'm not gonna do this shit. I
[13751.99s -> 13758.23s]  have to- I'm gonna try to stand right here. Are they spawned? I don't think they're here.
[13759.03s -> 13765.29s]  The game doesn't know that they're here. Okay. It's possible. It's possible.
[13775.18s -> 13784.14s]  I'm just gonna take a buzzer to my head. This looks like this hair falling down in my mouth.
[13790.06s -> 13806.54s]  Hair clippers. Hair buzzers. Guys. Alright get over here. That bone is gonna screw me over
[13806.54s -> 13833.99s]  here. Slow down. No it just takes up too much real estate. They both gotta go. They both gotta
[13833.99s -> 13838.39s]  go. They do. If they take up too much space I gotta go right for them right in the beginning.
[13838.39s -> 13850.55s]  I can't fucking believe it. The one time that that happens. The one time that it actually is
[13850.55s -> 13858.14s]  high enough out of the fucking ground to hit me through the ground. What? And I-
[13859.58s -> 13864.14s]  This little Mega Man area boss zone is starting to get under my skin.
[13864.86s -> 13883.91s]  I'm not gonna make it. See? Sometimes you gotta pull up. Reassess the situation. Watch out.
[13883.91s -> 13908.81s]  Don't get hit by that one pixel. Okay. I gotta bait out one. Oh man. There's no way that this-
[13908.81s -> 13916.65s]  I don't- There's no way. There's no way. It takes up so much space. Why? There's no way.
[13924.09s -> 13937.93s]  You can't jump on this part of the level. There's no jumping. That guy wasn't even
[13937.93s -> 13951.02s]  throwing at anything. He just was whipping a newspaper into the wall. Do it again. I'm going
[13951.02s -> 13970.01s]  the other way. I'm gonna cry foul on that because what the- I'm crying foul on it.
[13970.73s -> 14013.05s]  It's slippery. Every single thing is fucking slippery. It's driving me mental. No it's
[14013.05s -> 14019.34s]  slippery man. I'm gonna play a normal level after this and I'm gonna be terrible.
[14019.34s -> 14026.14s]  Terrible. Terrible. I can't even jump over you. I can't jump over this. Yes I can.
[14039.40s -> 14083.74s]  It's on now motherfuckers. I'm freaking out. I got- Okay now- No!
[14085.26s -> 14095.98s]  That's what you have to do. It's sliding around. It's the sliding around that really
[14095.98s -> 14108.98s]  causes the problem for me. It's sliding the fa- You know that I'm literally shaking right now.
[14108.98s -> 14132.92s]  I'm literally shaking and crying. Alright just scratchy ass neck. I keep- Man when you have
[14132.92s -> 14139.34s]  to hold down so many buttons at the same time and you just worry about fucking- I swear man
[14139.34s -> 14145.02s]  this slipping fucking bullshit is- I'm gonna slide down my stairs. I'm gonna baseball slide
[14145.02s -> 14150.70s]  down my slates and go through the front door. I'm gonna put a slip and slide on my stairs and
[14150.70s -> 14164.90s]  just wet it and just slide down as fast as I can. Thank god there's another mushroom because
[14164.90s -> 14195.58s]  it's so- No and you fucking blew it again. I can't believe it. Why? I just wanted to
[14195.58s -> 14208.62s]  restart from the checkpoint. This is an icy motherfucker. I'm not doing it again but I'm
[14208.62s -> 14221.74s]  so close. You gotta be kidding me. Why do bad things have to happen? Why? What if I do it
[14221.74s -> 14237.38s]  in one go? I can't believe people are gonna come to the stream back from like 40 minutes ago
[14237.38s -> 14243.06s]  and they're gonna be like you're still here at the beginning. No I'm not. I'm not. It started
[14243.06s -> 14249.14s]  over. Accidentally I pressed the wrong button. Did Nintendo wish the confirmation that you
[14249.14s -> 14252.18s]  want to start from the beginning of the level without the checkpoint? Where's my confirmation?
[14254.26s -> 14276.58s]  I'm fucking over. I'm so- it's over. Come on controllers. I'm so- I'm just like mutated
[14276.58s -> 14284.90s]  right now. If you did like a scan of my brain right now the doctor would be like what the fuck
[14284.90s -> 14294.57s]  is happening? I don't understand this. How do you have a lion brain? Have you eaten potato
[14294.57s -> 14311.02s]  chips like too many? How is your DNA mutated? I don't get it. It didn't cough into his hands
[14311.02s -> 14317.64s]  right in my face. Sorry, sorry. I finally did it. That's the first time I've ever done that.
[14317.64s -> 14323.10s]  So we're gonna get it. We're gonna get it like perfect first. Remember this part? I remember
[14323.10s -> 14336.34s]  this part. Easy. Remember this part? I do. Oh press that before you click the switch.
[14337.82s -> 14351.21s]  Holy shit. It's so bad. Like that's such a bad, bad area to fall down in. But I made it.
[14352.01s -> 14366.02s]  I can get back there. Oh my god remember this part? Yep I do. It sucked. Oh it sucked.
[14366.02s -> 14390.06s]  Oh it sucked. Jeremy? Wait you gotta get the thing. Jeremy? Jeremy? Almost there.
[14390.70s -> 14407.11s]  Oh I remember this part. This sucked. No it didn't. It's just patience.
[14408.07s -> 14412.15s]  It's just patience. I'm already back here so we're good. I can beat it. I can do it.
[14414.47s -> 14422.98s]  I know I can. Forget about this. The jumpscare. It's not real. I thought.
[14422.98s -> 14459.14s]  Press that button. Jeremy? No stop that. No let me go. Let me go.
[14473.62s -> 14480.23s]  Forget it. I'm falling. I'm falling off the edge here.
[14482.07s -> 14494.50s]  Oops. I need Yoshi. I don't. I need Yoshi. I have to. I have to go jump over here. I need
[14494.50s -> 14505.91s]  Yoshi. Oops. Guys and why did I get stuck on the guy's body? I got stuck on his head.
[14506.87s -> 14524.65s]  Do you guys think that people like throw up from playing these these levels?
[14525.53s -> 14538.76s]  I swear to god people puke from these. I'm talking full on like you have to run to the
[14538.76s -> 14552.41s]  bathroom because it's. Good. Good job. I did it. What? Where did he go? Slow down. Don't.
[14552.97s -> 14559.13s]  Everything is fucking icy. Why? Just get on Yoshi. Please get on him. Get on him. No.
[14571.83s -> 14582.04s]  Just ride it over. I need to get over here. I'm not even done either.
[14585.98s -> 14592.30s]  You stupid bastard. What have you done? You're lucky. You're lucky that you didn't
[14592.30s -> 14605.98s]  just make me mad. You ever eat so much that you feel sick and you throw up?
[14606.78s -> 14611.78s]  That's called overeating and you shouldn't be doing that. Once you get to about 80 full
[14611.78s -> 14617.06s]  you should stop eating and then after about 20 to 30 minutes your hunger reflex will turn off
[14617.06s -> 14629.05s]  and you will not be hungry at all. Just a quick little tip. Oh no. Okay. Back where I was before.
[14629.77s -> 14646.22s]  Almost right? Getting there. This is it. Made it. Everything's fine. We're good. Now I just
[14646.22s -> 14671.96s]  need to complete it. Yeah I was watching Mario Maker. There was this guy that was streaming
[14673.56s -> 14707.34s]  and he was he like he sucked at the game. No way. Really? You know when athletes after they
[14708.62s -> 14715.90s]  play a tough game they sit in that like fucking ice bath? I'm gonna have to I don't think I'm
[14715.90s -> 14733.90s]  gonna do that. How much are those? Are they expensive? No it's ice. No that's not what
[14733.90s -> 14738.22s]  I'm talking about. Notice how I went backwards? Notice how I went backwards so I didn't make sure
[14738.22s -> 14767.69s]  I didn't kill him. Where really? Where did that even come from? I need this. Okay.
[14768.33s -> 14773.37s]  Didn't get the first one. I thought I could get the first one. One little
[14778.09s -> 14791.26s]  you dick. Okay I got one. One is dead. Is that enough? Might be enough. Dude dude dude
[14791.50s -> 14802.74s]  this part it takes you like six seconds to start moving. Look at this. That's a full six goddamn
[14802.74s -> 14813.90s]  seconds. I don't even care about that one. Oh that was that was really I'm really happy
[14813.90s -> 14819.98s]  about where that hitbox was. It's just I'm I'm so happy about it. I will sing about it.
[14831.88s -> 14838.17s]  I just throw things forward and there's nobody there. I throw them. I just throw
[14838.33s -> 14845.03s]  you don't. You don't throw? No no I don't and I want something to be in front of me.
[14845.03s -> 14870.95s]  No I do not. Don't bring Otto into this. That's not Otto. This is Otto.
[14872.55s -> 14909.46s]  This part is the worst. It's the worst. There's nowhere to go. You have to get that shell
[14909.46s -> 14915.08s]  in there and you have to kill them both. There's nowhere to go. There's nowhere to go.
[14915.08s -> 14922.60s]  You have to get over there with the shell and get them both. There's no other option.
[14930.18s -> 14937.50s]  Get it in there with full health like my dad used to say. Get me to the last castle with full health
[14937.50s -> 14941.34s]  with but no with eight lives and I'll beat the game and he would. We just have to get
[14941.34s -> 14950.68s]  him there. I'm sorry dad. I you have one health. Oh no really. You gotta be. That's
[14950.68s -> 14957.08s]  two. That's two. That's two. That's two. I got it. Give me out. I accidentally just
[14957.08s -> 15036.98s]  beat this. I'm the only person that's done it. That's wow. Only two completions and 749.
[15038.14s -> 15050.65s]  Wow. Don't make me fucking angry here. These are cute but careful girl. Careful.
[15051.29s -> 15071.66s]  I enjoy you but be careful. That's a beautiful Otto. Calm down bud. This one's way easier.
[15071.66s -> 15083.74s]  Jerm is a good streamer. I appreciate him. Look clear required. Should have skipped.
[15085.58s -> 15099.00s]  This fireman. I mean like come on man. What is this? You've wrote a paragraph in here.
[15100.07s -> 15103.91s]  Hey my good friend Jeremy found a hilarious level that simulates how it is to be short
[15103.91s -> 15111.99s]  as a seven-foot man. You'll love it. I can't t-c-8-9-7-v-d-y-f. That's how I write checks.
[15111.99s -> 15117.11s]  You know you get to the end you're like ah two hundred and forty-five dollars and
[15118.39s -> 15127.82s]  raising cents. You could have put that a little more legible but you know what?
[15128.30s -> 15143.66s]  For the effort I'll do it. Let's see 8-9-7-v-d-y-f. Why would I report that? How do you all make ice
[15143.66s -> 15149.82s]  levels? It's my turn. I'm gonna write this one down too. I'm gonna write this down. Okay.
[15152.25s -> 15175.88s]  He did say it was his. It was my turn so. T-A-T-K-W-H-G. Okay. 53 minutes ago. How do you
[15175.88s -> 15185.53s]  guys draw on the switch like this? Well I guess you can use a stylus right? Did we
[15185.53s -> 15192.25s]  already do this one? That's a pretty, you know, that's a good enough Mario where I'm gonna write
[15192.25s -> 15200.18s]  this one down. All right. 7-6-N-1-C-E-R-F. Let's go through these and then we're not going to do
[15200.18s -> 15209.14s]  any more from the comments. We're gonna go into the chat after these three. Let's start with
[15209.14s -> 15230.74s]  this one. T-C-9-7-v-d-y-f. Let's give it a try. Puzzle solving short and sweet. This is by
[15230.74s -> 15237.34s]  Gary the Snail. It's called Super Ball. Black and white. Original Super Nintendo. Super original
[15237.34s -> 15253.06s]  Nintendo. Black and white. Not Cake Mario or Cake Luigi but it's close. Oh I remember this thing.
[15253.86s -> 15265.50s]  The little... Oh yeah you got my attention. Game Boy. You gotta skeeball it around.
[15267.00s -> 15281.67s]  Oh this is gonna be fun. Can I do it? Nice. Yeah it's a skeeball level. This is so happy.
[15283.74s -> 15286.14s]  Now this is the kind of salad level that I'm talking about.
[15286.86s -> 15312.34s]  Yeah this is the salad level that I wanted. I remember this... What was the one... What was
[15312.34s -> 15317.78s]  the Mario Game Boy game where you flew around in that ship and you... You shot out the little
[15317.78s -> 15332.52s]  pellets. What was that? Did I get it? I hit the POW. Mario Land. That's the one. I missed
[15332.52s -> 15350.30s]  that game. That game was so much fun. I get in there. Hit the POW. It still exists? Yeah
[15350.30s -> 15354.14s]  but I remember. What I'm saying is I remember playing it and I remember being really happy.
[15355.18s -> 15368.07s]  And it is this same song. What a good song. Get up there. Ding dong. I think I have to activate
[15368.07s -> 15405.54s]  these. I'm not getting in there. Is it despawning? Okay cool. Bounce it from here I think.
[15406.50s -> 15426.34s]  Yeah like right here. Ding dong. How many more? I have to bounce it. Probably gonna have to
[15426.34s -> 15440.87s]  bounce it up. Or maybe not. I guess... No I don't. No I don't. It's gonna be hard.
[15441.51s -> 15471.05s]  All right get it. Right here. Shit. Sands. Sure. Sure thing. Sands. I know this is the
[15471.05s -> 15487.40s]  right place. Okay wait wait one two three. There we go. This one's gonna have to travel.
[15488.12s -> 15495.06s]  Bounce it up off the wall twice. One two and then yeah probably like two. One hop up the
[15495.06s -> 15514.46s]  ceiling. Two hops off the ceiling. We're right down in the middle here. Again? All right I think
[15514.46s -> 15529.46s]  this is gonna hurt me. This is gonna hurt me isn't it? I guess that's what I was supposed to do.
[15530.42s -> 15543.53s]  Think? You gotta... I think I have to grab you? Yeah you gotta grab the little gopher.
[15544.49s -> 15558.66s]  You're stuck there forever. Bring him down here. No no no no. Get him. Get him. Okay now
[15558.66s -> 15564.12s]  I'm gonna move out of the way and drag him down there. I'm gonna transfer him.
[15565.08s -> 15595.02s]  No transfer. Transfer! Dope. No put him down. I'm trying to drop him on the treadmill
[15595.74s -> 15611.05s]  but the the hand keeps getting stuck. All right grab him and then you have to put him down. Put
[15611.05s -> 15624.79s]  him down this way. No! Put him down! Get over here! No you idiot! Where are you running to?
[15626.82s -> 15645.94s]  This way! Quick! I thought maybe I could kill him. I don't have a flower. Oh damn it.
[15646.74s -> 15672.89s]  I thought I could kill him. It's all right. No! Shoot him. I didn't have any flower. Leather
[15672.89s -> 15676.73s]  belt. Leather belt. Leather belt. Leather belt. What do you mean leather belt?
[15681.11s -> 15693.40s]  Leather belt. Leather belt. What does that mean? You guys are doing like a 13 year old
[15693.48s -> 15726.70s]  World of Warcraft reference right now? Cam on. I don't think I will. Come on. Yep. You want my
[15726.70s -> 15736.78s]  webcam on? What's it gonna add? It's not gonna add anything. Tell me what it's gonna add.
[15737.66s -> 15767.06s]  My beautiful face. Very sweet of you. So we can see how sweaty you are. I mean I look like
[15767.06s -> 15773.64s]  I probably I look like shit. I can probably guarantee you that. It's gonna add my face value.
[15773.64s -> 15780.25s]  Well you guys the reason why I don't ever do face cam is because I don't want to turn
[15780.25s -> 15785.93s]  face cam on because it's I can just I can be I can look whoever however I want and I don't have
[15785.93s -> 15788.89s]  to worry about people looking at me and going like holy shit his hair looks like dog shit
[15788.89s -> 15794.49s]  today and I'm like that you don't you could I could look perfect right now your image of me
[15794.49s -> 15804.02s]  right now is me in a nice three-piece fucking suit and I got my hair gelled back got a
[15804.02s -> 15809.46s]  clean shave I look great just have that memory have that in your mind you don't even know
[15809.46s -> 15815.82s]  what I look like right now now here's the issue what the hell do I do about this
[15816.70s -> 15823.70s]  ah somebody just somebody did that for me I don't even know how that happened
[15831.82s -> 15854.58s]  here's your answer all right drag him over here no you're causing me all kinds of fucking
[15854.58s -> 15877.51s]  pain right now let him go let him go you made it stupid hey I did it what he's an idiot
[15877.51s -> 15883.02s]  he's an idiot he shouldn't be following me around running back and forth in circles
[15883.02s -> 15901.43s]  he's stupid and he had the key I hate this streamer no you don't 60 completion rate that
[15901.43s -> 15918.06s]  was a fun one let's take a look at what people had to say hell enough ice clear required all
[15918.06s -> 15921.42s]  right well we're not no more of these from the comments on what I want to do these next
[15921.42s -> 15927.37s]  two and then pull in some from chat but there's the ID that was really fun that was cool
[15927.37s -> 15948.81s]  it was like a little ski ball one this is so fun what a fun game g4t h2k w h g
[15955.75s -> 15964.46s]  red coin castle um this is apparently pretty hard very hard one it's short and sweet
[15965.66s -> 15973.61s]  but only one percent completion why do I sound so stressed out it's but I'm stressed out what
[15973.61s -> 15988.46s]  are you talking about I'm as cool as a cucumber right now red coin castle this thing's only like
[15988.46s -> 16002.74s]  30 seconds long well that's not the right way that is not the right way to go because it's
[16002.74s -> 16013.58s]  rising let me check these how much surprise all the way I just need I gotta examine
[16017.86s -> 16020.74s]  why is it normal to eat a handful of pickles and not a handful of cucumbers
[16023.80s -> 16035.34s]  why are you eating a handful of what do you mean a handful that's not abnormal to eat
[16035.34s -> 16041.83s]  a handful of cucumbers what's what's so abnormal about that
[16043.75s -> 16054.14s]  oh I didn't see that if you you never eaten a cucumber before
[16056.14s -> 16064.98s]  wrong I've eaten like two or three cucumbers before
[16067.22s -> 16070.71s]  you just they you cut them up and you put salt and pepper on them and they're perfect
[16070.71s -> 16080.33s]  what's the big deal I need that salt pepper and a little bit of olive oil that's good
[16081.13s -> 16087.56s]  it's not weird that's not strange that's a snack it's a very healthy snack
[16096.49s -> 16102.90s]  how do I do this probably should go underneath
[16102.90s -> 16112.55s]  it's this way no
[16118.09s -> 16121.37s]  drop spin jump dummy ban that guy please
[16137.00s -> 16154.60s]  shit there's a lot of explosions going on I love that old Yoshi's Island coin sound
[16154.92s -> 16158.52s]  oh come on that didn't touch the bat the top of his head
[16159.24s -> 16176.10s]  come on you're making me look bad how many coins are there three that's not terrible
[16185.16s -> 16191.27s]  I was I didn't I was trying to get that one beat that one this guy's skills are insane
[16193.27s -> 16204.98s]  thanks I have been practicing a little who's playing he's awful his name is German985
[16205.86s -> 16213.10s]  he's a youtuber for a while and he made the switch to twitch he's been doing it pretty much
[16213.10s -> 16220.82s]  regularly he's very not he's a really nice person too like I met him in real life
[16221.94s -> 16225.26s]  sign my face and
[16231.30s -> 16250.09s]  it's got a vacation here things gonna come back and haunt me I know it
[16251.05s -> 16258.36s]  that was not intentional that was not intentional the stupid button just was pressed
[16259.32s -> 16264.87s]  I would much rather that be like left or r or something like right bumper left bumper or
[16264.87s -> 16278.23s]  something just down how many times they test this why is it just down why can't that just
[16278.23s -> 16286.87s]  be like right bumper right bumper left bumper right trigger and left trigger are the same
[16286.87s -> 16294.97s]  thing that's four different buttons you can press to do the spin you gotta press down to ground
[16294.97s -> 16347.62s]  pound I just I disagree no shit fired up all right now I gotta go no what the fuck man the
[16347.62s -> 16366.62s]  stupid I'm gonna rip this thing out I'm about to give up I can feel it I can get the yeti
[16366.62s -> 16371.74s]  levels of fucking getting uncontrollable levels I just that was really redundant what I just
[16371.74s -> 16388.47s]  said you understand three no what the fuck man it was there was right there and I just like
[16388.47s -> 16400.22s]  fucking fat fingered it go I need like two I thought it was I thought it was lava and it
[16400.22s -> 16415.21s]  freaked up isn't it rise what the fuck what it just done it too but why is this not rising
[16415.93s -> 16419.34s]  that's the thing that confused the fuck out of me and I didn't even get the first one
[16420.49s -> 16427.85s]  it is rising so how far hold on how far does this go all right so you can't effectively get
[16427.85s -> 16432.33s]  down there and so you have to be really careful because the lava will just be up there and
[16432.33s -> 16465.34s]  fucking support you out of here that was dumb shit I've ever seen in my life
[16465.34s -> 16543.46s]  Nintendo what are you thinking can I unbind down I feel like not having a ground pound
[16543.46s -> 16546.66s]  would actually if I had to go in and toggle it back on it would probably be better for me
[16547.62s -> 16561.74s]  to wait till that top this one shot
[16562.70s -> 16608.25s]  I don't want to spend like an hour on this one no no thank you is it gonna fire oh what
[16608.25s -> 16622.89s]  the fuck is it doing is it still hanging out somewhere go down and then I think I have to
[16622.89s -> 16636.18s]  ground pound it the lava's up wait till the lava to go down get the third key piece and then
[16636.18s -> 16658.07s]  get the hell out of here give me a checkpoint I deserve it I did it holy fuck
[16684.87s -> 16705.37s]  yeah I did it Jerma look at chat okay I'm looking at it right now what is it some

[16735.93s -> 16744.06s]  easy to do you can really easily accidentally just press a that was good that was tricky
[16744.06s -> 16749.72s]  that was hard I was willing to put like an hour into that one all right there's one more
[16749.72s -> 16757.18s]  that I took from the and then we're gonna do chat ones after this one and six and the one

[16946.76s -> 16956.39s]  an answer all right uh I see this one here this one looks potentially interesting
[16957.35s -> 16962.52s]  let's get this one for when I get back I'll be right back I'm gonna take a quick pee I'm gonna
[16962.52s -> 17174.42s]  grab some water see you in a minute or two oh hello again how do you I'm gonna copy this one

[17228.81s -> 17232.09s]  use all the items you can to destroy the seemingly endless door of munchers
[17239.45s -> 17242.81s]  the chickens are like gum they stay in your digestive system for three years
[17245.98s -> 17249.82s]  well I would I'm probably gonna have to go get like surgery because I've eaten like 40 on
[17249.82s -> 17254.62s]  the last like year or so all right so hold on I think I already blew it
[17261.03s -> 17264.55s]  all right so wait a minute look on music
[17266.74s -> 17275.61s]  wood gold all right we get the four elements here so when I pick up one okay I just picked
[17276.17s -> 17286.10s]  coin and I just turned it off but what is it hold on what about the shell oh dear
[17290.01s -> 17301.66s]  so the right coin moves I gotta get the shell so this right what is it what is he doing
[17307.94s -> 17325.54s]  I need to get that shell on the top left so that's
[17327.46s -> 17337.34s]  on but what is what happened over here whatever I'm gonna try to get the middle one
[17339.19s -> 17341.67s]  okay so that turned on the blue
[17344.23s -> 17351.94s]  so then turn the red back on which is the middle one right I'm killing them what are
[17351.94s -> 17361.78s]  the what's the left and right ones do left I don't know if it's doing anything oh that's
[17361.78s -> 17432.79s]  blue the coin order doesn't matter oh okay wait wait wait oh wait a minute
[17434.23s -> 17444.71s]  would you look at that okay let's just jump up here
[17448.60s -> 17454.04s]  so I screwed it up so I have to go back I mean this is working
[17454.60s -> 17464.62s]  oh wow can I pick up pow wait hold on
[17467.37s -> 17494.30s]  all right so everything's dead now I can can I go up there do this
[17497.45s -> 17542.26s]  what of the time the time the time the time jump up high how high do I have to do I just
[17542.26s -> 17564.06s]  can I just use this not really all right that's gone now let's see if I can get up there
[17564.78s -> 17591.75s]  I just want to put it down I'm trying this one one more time
[17594.82s -> 17611.10s]  no one else will ever die in that spot it's easy I just gotta get up top because then
[17612.14s -> 17628.65s]  it's let's make it blue then I can go in the tunnel in the pipe give me the power now this
[17628.65s -> 17635.85s]  gets rid of the who cares about the coin I'm not gonna get it I just want to place this here
[17641.48s -> 17646.36s]  oh shit I have to switch the thing don't die by this spike don't die by that spike don't die
[17646.36s -> 17660.52s]  by that spike don't die by that spike don't die by the spike that was so so careful too
[17663.08s -> 17673.54s]  you saw how careful I was being I was trying to be so so it has to be blue but no I can't
[17673.54s -> 17679.67s]  even get up there if the blue is switched I'm so confused
[17682.23s -> 17689.72s]  so do I need to use the power how do I switch it when I try to get up there
[17695.51s -> 17698.23s]  maybe I shouldn't take the power maybe I should throw the power when I get up there
[17706.55s -> 17712.23s]  there's not even use the power but then how do I trigger this to open the door up to the
[17713.11s -> 17728.04s]  I'm gonna put it down does this blow everything up if I place it no okay so now get up there can
[17728.04s -> 17748.36s]  I get up there with this and then throw it I was trying to go put it on I guess I
[17749.64s -> 17768.57s]  I was gonna just go put the helmet on did I not understand can I not just walk up and grab
[17768.57s -> 17793.50s]  it did I touch it no I don't I don't think I can get it all right I'm I'm I'm moving on

[18024.66s -> 18039.58s]  got a little chaotic at the end there but that was really pretty good only two people
[18039.58s -> 18049.30s]  have played this two out of two 100 what do the people have to say cool nothing

[18085.18s -> 18090.78s]  an ironic statement because it's this is one of those impossible ones or if this is actually
[18090.78s -> 18097.93s]  a really easy one that's going to be very very simple for me to do time will tell I don't
[18098.01s -> 18115.30s]  know goku in smash well I I think it's it's probably going to be pretty puzzle solving
[18122.60s -> 18185.19s]  goku really goku smash this one that's funny okay we got one here goku in smash

[18320.58s -> 18331.13s]  died to a relaxing level you can still die that's not anything to be made fun of for
[18331.85s -> 18371.90s]  the secret up here what does that say it's not even a pea pants level what are you talking
[18371.90s -> 18385.62s]  it's not a pea pants level well that was kind of a pea pants moment right there but it's all
[18399.50s -> 18404.66s]  right and you're talking and making references and doing a voice poorly
[18405.38s -> 18411.86s]  and it's distracting enough where you can't do anything else you literally cannot do anything
[18411.86s -> 18435.19s]  else when you do that so stop it you peed my pants okay those make chickens that sound
[18435.19s -> 18444.38s]  really really good right now after a long day screaming nearly crying and shit my god

[18519.85s -> 18525.50s]  it was that was fun all right should I should I take the one where somebody says
[18526.06s -> 18532.58s]  putrid level if you have that kind of description I'm not sure that's the one I want to do
[18533.14s -> 18560.14s]  well I'm gonna try okay five nine two rm no no lettuce on it not for McDonald's for some
[18560.14s -> 18563.26s]  reason I don't know what it is but sometimes you go to McDonald's and you get lettuce on
[18563.26s -> 18574.47s]  your sandwich it's this wilted hot gross disgusting filmy just tiny thin filmy hot thing
[18575.03s -> 18584.57s]  it's like a wet napkin on your chicken sandwich not very appetizing sludge surfing in space
[18585.21s -> 18592.58s]  it's like cooked spinach yeah but it doesn't taste as good as cooked spinach
[18593.46s -> 18605.18s]  it tastes like a napkin I don't think I'm supposed to do that I'm gonna get in all
[18605.18s -> 18620.89s]  right let's go sludge racing good music choice can I not go in oh sorry my pee pants

[18651.75s -> 18655.59s]  it should give me something that should protect me at least five percent five
[18655.59s -> 18665.88s]  percent left after talk to poison talk to this tick poison so I got a question for you guys so
[18665.88s -> 18671.80s]  this is this would be mario maker's dream technically number three you want to see this
[18671.80s -> 18687.26s]  again I'm willing to do it again in a small dose it's pretty fun I guess it's pretty
[18687.26s -> 18699.11s]  creative people are pretty creative it's fun I need to hit that I don't know what's oh
[18699.11s -> 18711.72s]  shit okay yeah actually be careful I'm scared to get with it whatever this is he's dead right

[18717.46s -> 18739.46s]  that what is it it's just a it's a bait was it worth it no I didn't I thought it may have
[18739.46s -> 18756.70s]  been something cool it's just an extra shroom what did it cost uh you know the answer to
[18756.86s -> 18783.54s]  that question no get up get up easy all right now I want to go I want to get that
[18784.26s -> 18787.22s]  bump that's up there this bump up here I'm gonna bump it

[18813.32s -> 18826.15s]  what was wrong with it what was wrong with it what was I too tall I was just too tall for
[18826.15s -> 18842.17s]  this oh can I thankfully the checkpoints right there I'm now I'm small so this should work out
[18849.91s -> 18860.71s]  mushroom got it I think I waited too long dead yeah
[18867.74s -> 18878.62s]  that again I don't know why I have this weird urge to like tell you very loudly what's about
[18878.62s -> 18888.55s]  to happen and that is so hard to even do even if I try to do what I just did again
[18888.55s -> 18911.67s]  I wouldn't be able to do it these are some rare deaths yeah I'm so paranoid about hitting
[18911.67s -> 18919.11s]  the edge there that's enough time right yeah oh

[19109.83s -> 19131.91s]  clear on that why now we don't there's no speed there's no do it in a minute it's just
[19132.79s -> 19153.54s]  simply eat it on the stream okay I'm gonna do it why like what's the problem here uh this
[19153.54s -> 19162.95s]  is Vinny's level I'm gonna put down to do next I'm just just one right I mean I'm gonna buy four
[19162.95s -> 19175.18s]  but I'm only gonna eat one on stream and I'm gonna turn stream off this is the weirdest
[19175.18s -> 19179.02s]  thing I think I've ever had requested is can I pay you 20 dollars for you to eat a McChicken
[19185.16s -> 19200.17s]  that's such a ridiculous return on investment a McChicken is a dollar all right well I got a
[19200.17s -> 19205.32s]  couple more written down here thanks for the fun level it was pretty good I'm gonna do this
[19205.32s -> 19225.86s]  one HOM this shit is so cool though it really is imagine back in the 80s telling somebody this
[19225.86s -> 19233.98s]  is going to be possible this never-ending content Mario's Vacation Tower Heist it's a day off here
[19233.98s -> 19242.84s]  and Mario would like to go robbing Bowser again would you get in a bathtub of mac and
[19242.84s -> 19245.48s]  cheese for a hundred dollars and stream it no I'd have to be way more than that because
[19245.48s -> 19250.04s]  I would destroy the bathtub the box that the amount of macaroni and cheese would take to fill
[19250.04s -> 19259.58s]  a bathtub would be like 500 bucks it wouldn't be a hundred dollars it would fuck up the whole
[19259.58s -> 19272.18s]  bathtub and how many you understand how many boxes that is oh shit yeah that would probably
[19272.18s -> 19283.48s]  take at least 50 to 100 boxes to fill a whole bathtub I was trying to do something
[19283.48s -> 19290.33s]  cheeky over there just cover the drain
[19292.57s -> 19298.34s]  uh yeah just cover the drain
[19301.22s -> 19309.62s]  look at that rat having a good time bouncing around I'm too busy looking at the rat
[19309.62s -> 19328.65s]  and I think I've died I think I've been killed left side technically you didn't say you
[19328.65s -> 19339.70s]  wouldn't do it um guys I am not going to fill a bathtub I'm gonna deny that now I'm
[19339.70s -> 19353.62s]  not going to fill a bathtub with macaroni and cheese that's not gonna happen I gotta get across
[19353.62s -> 19372.94s]  here damn all right I gotta be up top on top of that and then up to the left well I'm not
[19373.66s -> 19402.63s]  that no amount of money is gonna have me do that just dropping goombas um so then how do I
[19403.99s -> 19406.39s]  what do I do let's go
[19413.08s -> 19439.10s]  okay and then we go damn we controller switch controller down ground town bullshit it should be
[19439.10s -> 19460.17s]  one of the triggers it's so easy to accidentally press this shit all the time uh Vilemi gave 50
[19460.17s -> 19468.89s]  dollars thanks for the 50 thanks and 50 bucks for learning huge money this is this is probably
[19468.89s -> 19475.86s]  McChicken money uh if I were to take a guess I wonder I haven't read it yet so I think it's
[19475.86s -> 19492.87s]  McChicken then let me see oh my god that just freaked me out the freaking thing's fallen um
[19492.87s -> 19497.51s]  Jeremiah I'll give you another 50 bucks I'll give you 5,000 bits if you wash down the
[19497.51s -> 19507.27s]  McChicken by chugging a Mountain Dew throwback no I'm not doing that thank you for the 50
[19507.27s -> 19512.23s]  dollars but I'm not chugging a Mountain Dew throwback I will have a stomach ache
[19513.98s -> 19529.03s]  I will have a problem it's not good for my health scream and fall down
[19544.07s -> 19556.89s]  what the fuck it's not what I didn't touch the flag why is the level go so
[19558.81s -> 19616.94s]  oh I jumped over the flag no you bumped your fucking head on the goddamn ceiling and it lost
[19616.94s -> 19624.58s]  why do you not attach to the wall like 25 percent of the time it's only in this like
[19624.58s -> 19628.82s]  new Super Mario fucking Five Toads game that's what happens
[19629.62s -> 19672.63s]  oh wow oh I wonder what happened I wonder what happened
[19673.67s -> 19677.43s]  what's up Vegeta maybe I you know be careful he's gonna be up taking off all his powers
[19696.18s -> 19698.02s]  you must have accidentally pressed down on the d-pad
[19700.26s -> 19717.34s]  maybe you gave me the controller I'd be able to take care of it really it's too hard
[19718.06s -> 19735.43s]  it's too hard why am I turning into the guy from Ghostbusters 2 why am I dripping with goo
[19741.10s -> 19761.37s]  the most unbelievable man I gotta wait till it switches and then now I have to go ready
[19762.78s -> 19771.16s]  that's not what I have to do at all that's incorrect it's only a game why do you have to
[19771.16s -> 19784.26s]  be mad because it's fucking hard and it makes me upset that's why I can't even see it's not
[19784.26s -> 19791.50s]  just a game this is this is not just a video game now a task that I need to accomplish
[19799.96s -> 19837.90s]  I'm going to fucking freak out accidental ground bounce oh my god I'll ever tilt
[19838.70s -> 19842.94s]  somewhat in the direction of down you'll go straight into the ground
[19843.98s -> 19852.10s]  I think I need a big chicken I would rather eat a big chicken than press down on the d-pad
[19852.10s -> 19869.16s]  accidentally on this dumb controller turn the webcam on because I want you to see this this
[19869.16s -> 19888.79s]  is important to me down I'm down oh by the way if you want to use these my thumb covers

[24248.90s -> 24275.98s]  oh it's not fucking tall enough there's secrets over here
[24279.75s -> 24289.19s]  I'm gonna I'm so uh is this is this what it looks is this what seven hours of Mario maker

[24316.07s -> 24323.51s]  the stream when I complain it's just I'm just like coping with the fact that I'm not okay
[24324.55s -> 24329.59s]  that actually was bullshit it actually was because I got the indicator on my controller
[24329.59s -> 24335.35s]  that it was being turned off because the battery's low so that is what's happening that is dog shit
[24348.54s -> 24371.75s]  toad's base stats are worse I'm just kidding the controls are fine I want like big diaper toad
[24372.63s -> 24384.79s]  I thought I could get it physics when we're going on there for that to happen whatever
[24384.79s -> 24399.22s]  this works out last time what's going on here what's over here I don't know what I don't
[24399.22s -> 24406.20s]  should go down there's an option I don't think I should go down that's the door and then got

[24552.10s -> 24565.03s]  a bubble bath screen I actually thought about it would be funny to stream me in a huge bubble bath
[24565.99s -> 24570.60s]  but that's like just creepy and fucking weird and odd and I don't think that's I'm not I
[24570.60s -> 24586.34s]  don't want to do that I already got I got the award in 2016 for weirdest person on

[24779.69s -> 24789.86s]  all it took I can't believe it I didn't think that was what was gonna take what time is it
[24789.86s -> 24801.24s]  right now like 1 a.m eastern I got time I got I got enough time for the McChickens to show up
[24801.24s -> 24813.50s]  here thanks for hanging out guys still a lot of people here hope you're enjoying this stream
[24813.50s -> 24832.94s]  hope you're having fun I know I am don't blow these up I need to do this is my favorite
[24832.94s -> 24850.22s]  stream ever I'm glad you can put up with my bullshit ding dong well the question is
[24851.18s -> 24864.62s]  he's coming over here um do I need another bomb or something how many McChickens are you
[24864.62s -> 24879.50s]  getting that's for me to know and you to see three um what am I supposed to do but down
[24879.50s -> 24889.10s]  there you're doing a 50 McNugget challenge now you guys ever tell you the story of how
[24889.10s -> 24892.70s]  friends of mine told me they wanted to do a big McNugget challenge where actually it was
[24892.70s -> 24899.96s]  a Wendy's chicken nugget challenge and they talked it up for a couple hours sitting around
[24899.96s -> 24905.88s]  just hanging out hey yeah who's gonna go get them I'd like I don't want to go get them
[24906.84s -> 24912.44s]  so I was like this is gonna be fucking hilarious you guys I'll go get them so they
[24912.44s -> 24916.68s]  wanted 50 Wendy's nuggets and they're gonna have a contest who could eat them fastest and
[24916.68s -> 24921.56s]  shit so I went all the way to Wendy's and I got all these nuggets and it was like a stupid
[24921.56s -> 24927.56s]  order the person was like how many do you want 50 oh okay like dick fine okay sure like this is
[24927.56s -> 24933.08s]  like a comedy order so I did it and I probably should have known there was like six people
[24933.08s -> 24937.56s]  that I was getting these nuggets for how do you do a contest with six people in 50 nuggets
[24937.56s -> 24942.36s]  that doesn't make any sense you would need like 200 for like six to eight people so
[24942.36s -> 24946.28s]  I bought them I eventually got the guy to give them to me went back to the dude's house
[24946.28s -> 24950.36s]  that we were hanging out at and they're like all right here they are okay let's open them
[24950.36s -> 24954.28s]  up and they got them all ready and they put them on a plate and then they just started eating them
[24954.28s -> 24958.76s]  normally and it was just a lie they just wanted me to go get them a bunch of chicken nuggets
[24958.76s -> 24962.68s]  and that was the way they were gonna get me to do it because I was so psyched for them to do
[24962.68s -> 24974.55s]  this they were eating them incredibly slowly in front of me so I was the asshole that went and
[24974.55s -> 24989.69s]  got 50 nuggets and speaking of um nothing that we were talking about what's to do here I
[24989.69s -> 24997.94s]  don't think I can make a jump can I jump up over this no it's gonna get eight nugget challenge
[24997.94s -> 25008.28s]  yeah that wouldn't that make any sense oh wait a minute hold on I'm talking about like
[25008.28s -> 25042.06s]  nugget challenges it's only give me a break one two three four five they just spam up
[25042.70s -> 25082.54s]  that's a fucked up jump oh man only on a derma stream would I feel bad about chicken nuggets
[25082.54s -> 25094.02s]  well I mean it was it was kind of funny a little irritated because I thought I was
[25094.02s -> 25139.27s]  going to show it was mildly irritating see a block to hit or anything
[25141.59s -> 25144.57s]  this is gonna be pain in the ass
[25150.10s -> 25167.14s]  is it gonna be safe I'm gonna go the other way let's check an update uh it'll be here soon
[25167.78s -> 25181.48s]  okay now what is that drops you in there I can climb across this right somebody
[25181.48s -> 25183.48s]  yell at me if I'm wrong I think I can though
[25186.20s -> 25199.29s]  forgetting that the thing has a hitbox five feet
[25233.85s -> 25250.14s]  I just effectively waited for the train by standing on the tracks not gonna be in my
[25250.14s -> 25284.30s]  best interest quickly quickly just like that same deal is this a Nintendo made level I don't

[25483.82s -> 25491.45s]  it shouldn't be too bad I'm gonna go now wait
[25494.17s -> 25505.26s]  shit all right how fast one is yes I gotta jump over it no that would be bad
[25506.22s -> 25520.15s]  oh why did I not get this I only have one more this is my last guy
[25526.44s -> 25558.22s]  I should be able to stand on it I have to run with it oh maybe I'm so timid it's bad get up
[25558.22s -> 25595.66s]  there that's it now grab the sprint wait what I'm just like fuck oh I almost died that was so
[25595.66s -> 25610.22s]  close that was inches this is the end this is my last shot to get through here so I gotta go

[25636.86s -> 25646.92s]  pixel that's gonna touch me if I stand here I don't know is it gonna hurt me
[25657.06s -> 25683.02s]  is that it no I I tried and I hit my head oh that was just the one jump but like I just
[25683.02s -> 25689.11s]  bumped the heads because it's it's it's you have to be perfect to get up there
[25691.91s -> 25701.80s]  oh no oh I'm just hanging out I'll be back here for a little while
[25704.36s -> 25707.96s]  I'm gonna hang out back here I'll see you guys in a minute just gonna be chilling back here

[25742.94s -> 25747.02s]  you just threw me off right there you don't need to tell me to watch out for my
[25747.02s -> 25751.26s]  surroundings to not throw my we mode into my fucking fridge okay I know you don't why do
[25751.26s -> 25759.74s]  you have to keep telling me this I promise I'm not gonna swing and like hit my little brother
[25759.74s -> 25786.54s]  in the head I'm gonna be sure you made that same joke on the main channel years ago it's
[25786.54s -> 25792.22s]  been a long enough time I can reason can I not touch the top
[25792.22s -> 25808.22s]  damn it it didn't touch the top either
[25833.69s -> 25839.21s]  you know it the screen that tells you to collect the coins I wish would just get out of the way
[25843.00s -> 25844.20s]  this shit's just in the way
[25849.98s -> 25854.38s]  I wonder what I have to do for this level it's not like Nintendo's told me three times
[25854.38s -> 25906.84s]  before I get to play again this one looks all right
[25927.40s -> 25932.20s]  why am I doing super expert because I am a maniac
[25952.36s -> 25955.80s]  expert is just as hard except the hot garbage is rarer
[25958.52s -> 25963.62s]  yeah what would what even classifies super expert well I screwed that up
[25964.50s -> 26024.89s]  see if I can do this one come on I can do it what oh I forgot about thought I could go through
[26024.89s -> 26031.67s]  like a jump through it is my mic broken no I'm just trying to concentrate I'm just sitting here
[26031.67s -> 26043.14s]  staring with my eyes wide open why am I turning around and hit springs you actually won't beat
[26043.14s -> 26072.87s]  this now that because one guy said that I'm gonna I'm gonna go for it you bet the uber
[26072.87s -> 26076.97s]  eats guy could beat this I bet she that she couldn't
[26087.96s -> 26094.44s]  well I don't do I'm like so concerned with like the three people in out of like four thousand
[26094.44s -> 26098.12s]  that'll tell me why you're not playing super expert what you suck you fucking idiot
[26098.76s -> 26112.79s]  then I'm like I can do it I'm capable I'm so concerned about like the five people
[26112.79s -> 26118.63s]  that would come here and be like oh this is dumb no I'm not I'm not dumb I can do super expert
[26118.63s -> 26142.02s]  watch oops oops oops those people are already gone they left like five hours ago no you gotta
[26142.02s -> 26159.32s]  go fast you can't just stop don't forget it again it's just too much to think about
[26159.32s -> 26169.30s]  oh it's all right whatever well where are those chicken sandwiches why does it take
[26169.30s -> 26177.26s]  you so long did I send this person into like a giant like drive-through line that's even worse
[26177.26s -> 26183.21s]  I'm even more of a bad person this person might be sitting in like a 12 car drive-through
[26183.21s -> 26195.46s]  line with three McChickens guess what he did again guess what he did he's he guess what he
[26195.46s -> 26199.62s]  did if you want you can rewind if you want to make sure if you know what he did he didn't
[26199.62s -> 26206.73s]  do the thing where he knocked this thing down again he's not capable of doing this I think and
[26206.73s -> 26212.97s]  what probably should happen he should probably go back to simple things like counting to ten
[26214.90s -> 26221.46s]  choosing what shape a shape looks like like circles squares you can do those I'm not
[26221.46s -> 26257.90s]  we're not sure what else he's capable of doing all right give me some fun levels all
[26257.90s -> 26261.66s]  right I've got no more of this no more of this let's do fun view levels with people
[26261.66s -> 26266.78s]  that are viewer levels you know I'm not no no no no I can do let's just play this is fun let's

[26292.46s -> 26297.10s]  I don't think I believe you though that's the thing I don't believe the word you're saying
[26297.10s -> 26303.11s]  right now let's see I can't wait to everyone to do like the Pepe fucking like
[26306.10s -> 26311.91s]  I came up with the Pepe like you know he doesn't know it is when you got it when you take a
[26311.91s -> 26332.09s]  hard one now everybody knows that the Pepe laugh is that like it's the dog from Dick Dasterly
[26333.75s -> 26384.10s]  Kanye Kanye of wisdom okay I'll try it oh what's this what's this thing

[26450.50s -> 26467.80s]  ripped off a piece of tissue paper this is lettuce and let's see how it tastes very bad
[26467.80s -> 26473.35s]  desynced it shouldn't be desynced oh I'll fix that don't worry I'm not going to eat it
[26473.35s -> 26488.42s]  until it's synced up trust me what do you think I'm crazy we should be synced up see if
[26488.42s -> 26495.30s]  you can hear the bite react more this would it be react it's a mick chicken sandwich I

[26556.54s -> 26575.21s]  that's impossible that's not possible it just turns into like gush it's not enough
[26608.01s -> 26610.09s]  making this not as enjoyable as it should be
[26625.43s -> 26667.91s]  no no no I'm not 33 I am hey look you get one life to be have to be 33 and have fun

[27228.74s -> 27238.60s]  when I get it back here it's I'm missing every moment so I have to like gum it like so once
[27238.60s -> 27260.34s]  it gets the initial bite down there these are spicy McChickens I don't know why but every
[27260.34s -> 27267.38s]  single time that I have ordered a McChicken in the last six months they've just given me a
[27267.38s -> 27272.20s]  spicy McChicken have they run out did McDonald's run out of regular McChickens and they're just

[27345.64s -> 27349.72s]  fucking dinosaur man like Barney Rubble
[27352.92s -> 27366.15s]  that's what your hands look like in a cartoon when Tom and Jerry come over and smash him with
[27366.15s -> 27372.49s]  a hammer oh I got something gross here yeah good thing the camera's not on because I

[27539.14s -> 27548.81s]  it's the council I'm not gonna lie I heard I swear to god I heard from inside of this can
[27548.81s -> 27557.91s]  I heard a there was sitting still on this desk I heard a like a bubble coming up and
[27557.91s -> 27584.31s]  popping up here like there's a fucking animal in here we got hold up we also got something
[27584.63s -> 27592.25s]  from it what is okay so we've also got I don't think I'm gonna be able to eat this
[27592.89s -> 27614.63s]  meal I'm gonna it's gonna be delicious anyways okay so um this is a no I promise you that's
[27614.63s -> 27623.35s]  not a picture of a salad that's a salad that's not a decorated plate that's a salad
[27623.35s -> 27635.54s]  I'm not gonna eat this salad I'm not gonna eat this salad and then here's the review

[27640.66s -> 27664.92s]  how's this one look let's actually unwrap this one well as we can see from the from the
[27664.92s -> 27682.30s]  unwrapping this somebody stomped on this this one's better this one what this one's a little
[27682.30s -> 27695.14s]  better fresher a little more of a zing to it although it kind of does have a little
[27695.30s -> 27701.22s]  happen something like the lettuces they're trying to get out and escape from out of the bump like
[27701.22s -> 27706.26s]  as you see the lettuce is trying to essentially get out it's crawling out to try to leave
[27708.33s -> 27720.98s]  sorry let me front page which didn't front page me right now that would be a mistake
[27728.38s -> 27748.97s]  that's no that's not real you guys with these pictures I swear this is this is not

[28364.06s -> 28370.90s]  fork or riot who goes to McDonald's and gets a fork they don't just hand them up they don't
[28370.90s -> 28376.06s]  just hand out those forks and what you're going to do is you're going to add two parts
[28376.06s -> 28387.22s]  of Parmesan cheese stir it up inside of that bowl chef chef John chef John from
[28387.22s -> 28401.66s]  foodwishes.com where did you come from I don't know if I want to eat one of these like

[28440.26s -> 28450.95s]  watch if I saw your face in real life I would laugh what does that mean this is real this
[28450.95s -> 28463.13s]  isn't but this is not real life how is this you can laugh now salad dressing in here and
[28463.13s -> 28482.46s]  use it as shampoo like just like condition it in there but that's not gonna happen come on
[28482.46s -> 28490.04s]  yeah yeah come on this is not IRL this is food and drink but isn't that this is this
[28490.04s -> 28498.57s]  it's the same subcategory isn't it drink the dressing I don't like dressing I'm one of those
[28498.57s -> 28512.31s]  weird vampire people that doesn't like put dressing on their salads you thought about it
[28512.31s -> 28517.58s]  I don't like dressing in clothes I like dressing in clothes are we gonna see the big
[28517.58s -> 28526.92s]  chicken in the germa rumble dressing is gross you're not weird well that thank you thank
[28526.92s -> 28536.30s]  you for saying that all right I'm gonna go I'm gonna cap this up final review so it's two
[28536.30s -> 28539.74s]  out of five so far I'm gonna give it I'm gonna give it a three no I'm gonna give it
[28539.74s -> 28546.81s]  a two eight out of five and the only reason why I'm doing that is because if we start at five
[28547.77s -> 28553.93s]  these french fries actually like they could have come out of the trash like I'm just being that's
[28553.93s -> 28561.27s]  a review that's not me like that's a review that's my opinion of this what that is the
[28561.27s -> 28566.20s]  salad's actually pretty good if you want to if you got a McDonald's salad you'd probably
[28566.20s -> 28574.49s]  think it was all right so but that brought it down like a whole letter grade the McChickens
[28574.49s -> 28578.97s]  tasted really good except those bones in them like two of them had like these weird chewy
[28578.97s -> 28583.61s]  like calluses in them so that brings it down another grade but they still tasted good it's
[28583.61s -> 28598.89s]  still they're still perfect McChickens are all amazing 2.8 I think I got a five I'll see
[28598.89s -> 28603.77s]  you tomorrow I'm out of here I'm going I'm going home I'm going home I'm going I gotta
[28603.77s -> 28610.33s]  go home that's what that one just tasted like it came right out of the ground does
[28610.33s -> 28615.69s]  that mean it's fresh if it was like dirt if you taste dirt does that mean like it's
[28615.69s -> 28631.26s]  fresh and it came out of the ground if you saw a guy in the subway eating like this
[28632.66s -> 28639.85s]  you'd move like four chairs to the right guys eating a salad with his fucking hands
[28640.65s -> 28646.97s]  and no dressing whoa bye I'm gonna stand and hold on to the thing I'm gonna stand I'm not
[28646.97s -> 28656.38s]  gonna sit next to this person this is the subway of twitch yeah it kind of is all right
[28656.38s -> 28668.38s]  I've got my greens I'm like smoking a cigarette here sweat check I'm not doing that
[28668.38s -> 28672.14s]  because I've got a lot of big hair under my arms and that would be embarrassing and everyone
[28672.14s -> 28689.96s]  would laugh at me so I'm not doing that thanks for watching everybody I'll see you tomorrow
[28690.60s -> 28706.70s]  this is not even I think this is Dr Pepper it's pretty good Mario Maker is a ton of fun

[28713.10s -> 28721.22s]  everybody making levels your creativity is fucking pretty sick I wouldn't classify this
[28721.22s -> 28724.82s]  as meltdown scream this was a positive meltdown you can use this two different meltdowns
[28725.38s -> 28729.30s]  there's like positive meltdown and there's negative meltdown you can go up you can have
[28729.30s -> 28743.38s]  an upwards meltdown there's a meltup yeah I still was having fun yeah that was a meltup
