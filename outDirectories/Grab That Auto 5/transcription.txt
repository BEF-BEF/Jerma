[0.00s -> 11.92s]  Let's go ahead and type in Grand Theft Auto into the App Store search bar.
[11.92s -> 20.44s]  Okay. Looks pretty legit, right? Looks pretty- San Andreas, you got Vice City, and you got all this.
[20.44s -> 30.17s]  What is all this? Grab the Auto 5. Please accidentally download me.
[30.17s -> 37.92s]  Okay, let's go ahead and uh... Thumbstick is right on an ad, so we're off to a great start here.
[37.92s -> 45.45s]  Do I have a mission to do? Or is this just pop in the game?
[46.34s -> 51.34s]  This engine, whatever it is, can't even load 15 feet in front of me.
[51.34s -> 56.04s]  I'm not even sure there's anything I can do here. Besides just drive around in the city and just walk around.
[56.04s -> 68.66s]  Alright! Let's get out and walk.
[68.66s -> 79.08s]  Does this actually have a radio like GTA as well? I want that bike.
[79.08s -> 86.64s]  Give me that bike. Yes, thank you. Thank you for getting off of your bike and dying.
[86.64s -> 88.60s]  Except he didn't.
[88.60s -> 93.60s]  Oh my god, I have to unlock- everything has to be unlocked. Money and diamonds and shit.
[93.60s -> 99.31s]  Let's just get back in my burger car, one of the only cars I can fucking drive.
[99.31s -> 103.43s]  Hold on.
[106.46s -> 110.75s]  They take a very long time to load.
[110.75s -> 117.12s]  This one has graphics. This music is so annoying.
[117.12s -> 119.62s]  Is anyone driving this car?
[119.62s -> 123.68s]  No, there's not. Nobody's driving the car.
[123.68s -> 130.91s]  How do I shut this music off?
[130.91s -> 137.88s]  Fucking music. I can't get over this music.
[137.88s -> 144.52s]  Shooting at it? Oh boy.
[144.52s -> 148.69s]  Am I still in their car?
[148.69s -> 151.70s]  Watch out for the cop car.
[151.70s -> 160.67s]  God, this camera. What are you doing, camera?
[160.67s -> 166.87s]  Why is it just singing to me?
[166.87s -> 171.37s]  Is that a police car or is that a bird, like a chickadee?
[171.37s -> 176.30s]  Cops found you. Get rid of them.
[176.30s -> 180.65s]  So they're just surrounding me.
[180.65s -> 183.34s]  Holy shit.
[183.34s -> 186.22s]  What am I supposed to- how do you beat that?
[186.22s -> 195.07s]  See, the greatest part about this is these two guys that don't care at all.
[195.07s -> 199.14s]  This is pretty normal to them, apparently.
[199.14s -> 203.86s]  It's just a normal day in Shitsville.
[203.86s -> 216.54s]  Two guys shooting at each other through a bunch of fucking bricks.
[216.54s -> 218.54s]  What is it with those guns?
[218.54s -> 228.10s]  There's like silly bullets in those guns.
[228.10s -> 231.90s]  No way.
[231.90s -> 234.90s]  We know this guy really likes this song. That's good to know.
[234.90s -> 236.90s]  At least he's got a favorite song.
[236.90s -> 240.92s]  This one's real bare bones.
[240.92s -> 245.06s]  There was no loading screen. There was no menu. It's just one.
[245.06s -> 253.98s]  Okay, um, I wish I could explain how hard this was to move, but I can't.
[253.98s -> 260.10s]  Oh, holy shit. That's a lot of money.
[260.10s -> 263.67s]  That guy was holding a bank vault worth of money.
[263.67s -> 267.24s]  Go get it. 20 bucks.
[267.24s -> 270.52s]  Where are you going?
[270.52s -> 274.90s]  I'm a psycho.
[274.90s -> 276.90s]  I can follow that guy.
[276.90s -> 280.78s]  Get out of the- pull him out of the window. Just rip him out of the windshield.
[280.78s -> 285.53s]  What is going on with- that guy just turned into a bunch of luggage.
[285.53s -> 288.80s]  There's a Mack truck. This guy's-
[288.80s -> 293.84s]  Oh. Pull him over.
[293.84s -> 316.39s]  God. Same game. Same engine. Same music.
[316.39s -> 320.39s]  The only difference is this time they decided to make you a robot Spiderman.
[323.74s -> 326.11s]  I guess this one's a slot machine.
[327.11s -> 329.82s]  No.
[329.82s -> 338.31s]  I'm gonna give it 15 seconds before I get run over.
[338.31s -> 341.70s]  Is somebody behind me?
[341.70s -> 345.52s]  Somebody's just throwing punches at me. Get out of here.
[345.52s -> 352.50s]  Are you serious? Is he still behind me?
[352.50s -> 353.50s]  He died.
[353.50s -> 358.17s]  This is another goal-less game.
[358.17s -> 361.86s]  Where the goal is-
[370.48s -> 373.17s]  Get away from me.
[373.17s -> 375.17s]  You fucking idiots.
[375.17s -> 387.82s]  Where are all these people coming from? Why are they fighting?
[387.82s -> 389.57s]  Why?
[389.57s -> 392.57s]  Is this dude just gonna stop fighting them?
[392.57s -> 394.94s]  Why would you start fighting this guy?
[394.94s -> 401.11s]  I don't know. I don't understand.
[401.11s -> 405.11s]  Is there a reason why these people are all doing this?
[407.74s -> 412.74s]  I can sit here and watch. It's a conga line of people punching each other in the back.
[412.74s -> 414.74s]  And then flying.
[414.74s -> 433.52s]  Oh, I'm gonna need a minute after this one.
[447.36s -> 457.17s]  It's never gonna stop. This is never gonna stop.
[457.17s -> 459.17s]  I'm gonna die.
[459.17s -> 461.17s]  I'm seriously gonna die.
[461.17s -> 463.17s]  I don't think I'm gonna live through this one.
[469.24s -> 478.30s]  This is the best thing I've ever seen in any game.
[479.30s -> 482.30s]  There's no reason for this to be happening.
[482.30s -> 490.60s]  I don't ever want this to end.
[490.60s -> 494.60s]  I don't want to hit pause. I don't want to hit replay. I don't want to stop it.
[494.60s -> 499.60s]  But you know what? I gotta get out of here. I have to stop this madness.
[499.60s -> 502.60s]  Because I'm seriously gonna throw up if I stay here any longer.
[502.60s -> 505.60s]  As amazing as this is.
[505.60s -> 507.60s]  So, I'll talk-
