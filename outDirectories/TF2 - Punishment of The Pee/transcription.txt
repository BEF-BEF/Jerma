[18.76s -> 21.83s]  Ooh, this is a good place to do this.
[21.83s -> 23.83s]  This is a good place to do this.

[70.60s -> 73.22s]  I gotta piss.
[73.22s -> 75.22s]  I gotta pee so bad right now? Is that the problem?
[75.22s -> 77.22s]  Who is on this point? There's nobody on the point.
[77.22s -> 79.22s]  Where is this guy?
[79.22s -> 82.17s]  What the fuck? It was a pyro?
[82.17s -> 84.17s]  No, I'm not allowed to pee.
[84.17s -> 86.17s]  I'm not allowed to go pee yet until I win a round.
[86.17s -> 88.79s]  That's the punishment for me just like
[88.79s -> 90.79s]  whiffing on like nine arrows in a row.
[90.79s -> 93.35s]  Do it for the camera. Go...
[93.35s -> 95.35s]  Yeah! Nice. Good spin, bro.
[95.35s -> 97.35s]  Do it again. One more time.
[97.35s -> 99.35s]  One more time for the camera. Just for the camera.
[99.35s -> 101.35s]  For the camera. Come on. You got a camera point at me.
[101.35s -> 103.35s]  I got a camera point at you.
[103.35s -> 105.35s]  We're both...
[105.35s -> 107.72s]  Let's make this quick.
[107.72s -> 109.72s]  Because seriously, I'm going to piss my fucking pants.
[109.72s -> 113.48s]  Go to A first.
[113.48s -> 115.48s]  And Scout just kind of standing there.
[115.48s -> 118.04s]  He'll go down. Make it nice and easy.
[118.04s -> 120.92s]  Nice and quick.
[120.92s -> 123.48s]  Just like my old pancake recipe.
[123.48s -> 125.78s]  See, what you gotta do is you gotta do twigs.
[125.78s -> 128.28s]  No, don't worry. I'm not going to do that joke again.
[128.28s -> 131.03s]  That joke is going to be buried forever.
[131.03s -> 133.03s]  Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out.
[133.03s -> 135.27s]  Scout, turn. Turn around, Scout.
[135.27s -> 139.35s]  Where is he? What?
[139.35s -> 141.35s]  What kind of fucked up magic trick was that?
[141.35s -> 144.23s]  Now I'm going to burn.
[144.23s -> 146.79s]  Do you have any milk? Got milk?
[146.79s -> 149.66s]  Hey, got milk?
[149.66s -> 151.66s]  I really am going to burn though.
[151.66s -> 154.09s]  Like, I really am going to burn. This is a stupid idea.
[156.09s -> 158.09s]  Hey, got milk?
[158.09s -> 160.09s]  Hey, need some milk?
[160.09s -> 162.90s]  At least the Scout is going to get it.
[162.90s -> 165.21s]  Come on, Scout. Get it.
[168.22s -> 171.29s]  Why is nobody pushing B?
[171.29s -> 173.29s]  They got a sentry? Is that the issue?
[173.29s -> 175.66s]  Nice dodge. I'll accept it.
[175.66s -> 178.52s]  I'll accept that dodge for what it was.
[178.52s -> 182.68s]  No, no. Fuck you.
[182.68s -> 185.30s]  I ain't going to die right there.
[187.54s -> 190.73s]  No!
[190.73s -> 192.73s]  Scramble the teams. No, I gotta pee.
[192.73s -> 197.66s]  Do not scramble the teams. I've got to piss.
[197.66s -> 202.71s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[202.71s -> 205.02s]  Stack every single person on A.
[205.02s -> 207.02s]  Here comes a spy. He's not going to do anything
[207.02s -> 210.41s]  because there's like 12 of us here.
[210.41s -> 212.65s]  Just cap it. Nothing spooky.
[212.65s -> 214.65s]  Nothing fancy. Nothing...what?
[214.65s -> 217.98s]  How did you...
[217.98s -> 222.82s]  How did he get...
[222.82s -> 224.82s]  Okay, we're still...
[224.82s -> 227.32s]  No, that's a crit. Where are these people?
[227.32s -> 230.78s]  Come on up. Come on up. Yeah.
[230.78s -> 234.17s]  Come on up. I ain't losing this.
