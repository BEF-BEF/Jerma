[1.02s -> 16.28s]  Hey. Sorry. Hi guys. What a great way to start. Make a lot of fucking gross noises. But hello.
[18.25s -> 24.09s]  Sorry, I was doing something that required my attention, but still started on time with that
[24.09s -> 30.73s]  2 p.m. Right before 2 1 58 exactly. I think it was. Don't have to stream for 24 hours,
[31.37s -> 43.66s]  because as you see, if you type in the new the new emote, I told you that when the stream started
[43.66s -> 49.98s]  today, if there wasn't that emote there, that I would have to do a 24 hour stream. But thankfully,
[50.62s -> 53.82s]  look at that. It's there. By the way, I don't know what to title this stream,
[53.82s -> 60.52s]  because what the hell else do you title this? We're gonna play Darkwood. It's October. There's
[60.52s -> 65.96s]  been a lot of requests to play this game. I don't know why. And this is scary. Is it weird? Is it
[65.96s -> 75.62s]  intense? I don't know. I have no idea. But what am I right? Just is Darkwood. Should I just
[75.62s -> 94.50s]  title the game the name MonkaS? No, that's so it's too easy. Hold on. Yeah, if you have any
[94.50s -> 99.29s]  horror game suggestions that I have not played, throw it in the recommended channel. I'll take
[99.29s -> 110.26s]  a look at them because it is October. So I mean, right. It's Darkwood. I was gonna write like into
[110.26s -> 117.72s]  the into the dark wood, but that's too easy to that's simple. Sometimes just has to be what
[117.72s -> 131.59s]  you're doing. Dead Rising. All right, let me make a tweet. I'll be back in like 40 minutes.
[132.39s -> 153.54s]  Just making a tweet. I see a lot of Yes, yes, this game is so good. Yes, this game is so good. Is
[153.54s -> 162.58s]  it really? Is it good? Am I okay? Am I gonna like this game? Or is this gonna be one of those
[162.58s -> 165.78s]  scenarios where I'm just like, I don't I don't fucking get it. I don't find that's just fucking
[165.78s -> 174.90s]  stupid. It's stupid. That fucking dumb game. I don't fucking like this. Find out. But yeah,
[174.98s -> 182.20s]  let's go. Enjoy the new emote. There's a couple of scenarios where you should be using it, by the
[182.20s -> 188.52s]  way. Really, I think only one or two scenarios where that emote makes any sense. One is,
[189.16s -> 197.61s]  if I taste or smell something gross on stream, or if you if you hear this sound,
[198.33s -> 207.53s]  this is pretty much the only reason why I would be on. You can't even hear this.
[208.25s -> 219.94s]  So if you hear a vacuum cleaner on stream, if it's in a game, what a perfect opportunity.
[222.30s -> 229.37s]  Or if I'm like, that's it. Don't use it anywhere else, or I'll get rid of it. All right, let's go.
[229.37s -> 234.57s]  Let's do Darkwood. Funny thing about this game, I actually downloaded this game a long time ago,
[234.57s -> 242.42s]  apparently, and have seven minutes of playtime in this game. I don't know how I don't know when
[242.42s -> 257.90s]  or why. Did I open it and go now? I mean, that's, that's as long as it is to do the
[258.78s -> 268.94s]  options in your video settings. Derma, don't do this. Turn on face cam. All right, if you're good.
[272.22s -> 283.94s]  Not a blind stream. Well, the menu is maybe not blind. Turn on cam. If you're good. All right,
[283.94s -> 288.10s]  play. What if I imagine I hit play, and I didn't know that you guys could see that there was a
[288.10s -> 291.86s]  save game that has like seven hours of playtime, and I've just been fucking lying that I never
[291.86s -> 302.74s]  played it. Thank God. That was close. There's like four different save slots, all with like
[302.74s -> 309.18s]  20 hours of game time. Face cam. You'll get if you go if you'll get a face cam if you're good.
[311.74s -> 315.66s]  Difficulty normal. The forgiving mode. When dying, you drop part of your equipment. No.
[315.66s -> 319.18s]  The unforgiving mode. You have a limited number of lives. After that, it's game over. No.
[319.74s -> 330.04s]  The ultimate thrill. Death is permanent. No. Oh, there's no easy. Indiegogo content. This option
[330.04s -> 338.58s]  enables additional cool but immersion breaking content. I don't want that. Does that mean like
[338.58s -> 342.18s]  Thomas the Tank Engine is going to be in the game and like draw like a like a mod or something? I
[342.18s -> 354.68s]  don't want that. Skip the prologue. No, don't skip the prologue. Normal difficulty. I don't want to
[354.68s -> 362.23s]  break my immersion. I'm going to get super locked into this. All right, you ready? You'll get this
[362.23s -> 380.57s]  if you're good. Why is it glitching out? All right, you'll get this if you're good. Is he wearing
[380.57s -> 386.66s]  Aquaman? Yep. All right, I gotta put I'm not putting both headphones in. You're playing a
[386.66s -> 391.46s]  challenging and unforgiving game. You will not be led by the hand. Respect the woods. Be patient
[391.46s -> 398.84s]  and focus. Okay, so backseating is allowed in this stream. Those of you that backseating is okay.
[400.04s -> 404.36s]  I'm going to give you a phrase. If I use this phrase, that means tell me the answer. Okay,
[404.36s -> 407.56s]  I'm going to look into the chat and I'm going to say please tell me the answer.
[408.44s -> 413.13s]  And that's all that needs to happen. Backseating is completely allowed. Like,
[413.13s -> 417.29s]  I encourage it actually. You're not going to read a challenging unforgiving game like that.
[417.29s -> 422.41s]  And then I don't know. I'm going to focus but I want the answers. I'm going to get them.
[423.13s -> 427.69s]  I don't even know what's on this coffee cup. Prologue. Quiet.
[428.98s -> 431.54s]  You've been good enough. You'll get the face cam for five minutes then it's going off.
[435.83s -> 450.30s]  I see hatred and fear in their eyes. As if I was responsible for spreading for the spreading
[450.30s -> 457.27s]  disease. Okay, there's an illness. There's a disease. There's a disease. As if I were
[457.27s -> 469.51s]  the source of all the misery plaguing this land. All right. I have nowhere to hide from them,
[469.51s -> 474.07s]  nowhere to run. The woods have closed us off from the outside world. Give me the solution to the
[474.07s -> 490.41s]  first puzzle. I want pre-backseat gaming. We are all doomed. So we just wrote go left.
[497.91s -> 508.34s]  Alcohol distiller. This is like Hotline Miami. Table. Search. Pill. You can have 30 pills.
[509.85s -> 519.02s]  Is this my inventory? Notepad. My old notepad. Examine it. Nothing interesting apparently
[519.02s -> 531.75s]  happening. Nothing on here. There's no secrets. There's no clues on here. Okay. Chair. Drag the
[531.75s -> 541.37s]  chair. All right. I'm going to block the door in case anybody comes in. All right. Alcohol distiller.
[541.37s -> 549.11s]  A homemade device for producing moonshine. The audio is too low. Is the audio too low?
[549.11s -> 562.12s]  Hold on. Let me help you out here. That's probably better. How's that? Better? I think so.
[562.12s -> 565.32s]  A homemade device for producing moonshine. Okay. I don't have any moonshine. That's my health bar
[565.32s -> 570.94s]  and my stamina bar. Do it louder than this. Yeah, but it's a scary game. I don't want it to be that
[570.94s -> 581.90s]  loud. No, I know where it is. Apply these. Yeah. Hold on. Hold on. Everybody wants it to be loud
[581.90s -> 586.57s]  when like the monster jumps through the fucking window. I get it. There you go. There's your
[586.57s -> 594.54s]  immersion. It's going to be loud and scary. Okay. That's good. Somebody think of a title,
[594.54s -> 603.54s]  by the way, while I do this. Better? Wooden door open. Is there a sprint? There is. It takes,
[603.54s -> 608.50s]  what is that? It takes stamina. Barricaded window. Dismantling this now would be suicide.
[610.28s -> 613.48s]  All right. Okay. So this is a post-apocalyptic zombie world.
[614.36s -> 622.23s]  Potatoes. The only edible thing growing on this land. I still have some left.
[623.11s -> 627.99s]  What am I doing? What am I doing? What am I doing? What am I doing? Why am I tying my shoes?
[632.71s -> 639.88s]  Oh God. This generator is almost out of juice. I need to find a full gasoline can. I saw a broken
[639.88s -> 646.33s]  tractor to the east. Maybe I could find some gasoline there. Go left. Thanks for the tip.
[646.33s -> 659.38s]  Appreciate that. Nothing in the cages. This time they're empty. Nothing in the cage.
[660.26s -> 671.29s]  No, I just have some pills. Chair. What the fuck? My old zenith camera. Can I spin it around or
[671.29s -> 680.17s]  something? Can I take it with me? My old useless medical bag. It's a bag. It's not useless. Photo.
[684.52s -> 693.94s]  Oh, I see. There's like a, there's a ghost in this photo. 1985. All right. So did I take these
[693.94s -> 701.21s]  photos? I took this photo. All right. What about over here? I would rather not open it. I spent
[701.21s -> 708.17s]  too much time to lock him in there. I mean, lock who in there? But this guy I don't care about,
[708.17s -> 713.29s]  by the way. The guy in here. Container. The lock is jammed a long time ago. Never mind. I used to
[713.29s -> 716.33s]  keep useless junk in there anyways. Why do you have so much useless stuff? What's with all the
[716.33s -> 727.83s]  donuts? I don't know how to do that. How to do what? Him. Him. All right. Well, where's it gonna go?
[727.83s -> 732.95s]  I need to find a can of gasoline to the east. Locked. I think I left the key in the wardrobe.
[732.95s -> 743.19s]  Oh, come on. Where's the wardrobe? My tools. They haven't been sterilized for years. The
[743.19s -> 750.73s]  local patients can't be helped anyways. All right. So I can't use them. Where's the wardrobe?
[750.73s -> 762.50s]  This is not a wardrobe right here. Isn't this a wardrobe? How do I leave my house?
[763.22s -> 771.06s]  How do I leave the house? Locked. I think I left the key in the wardrobe. Oh, there's another room
[771.06s -> 774.90s]  here. You can only select and interact with objects within your reach. The interaction
[774.90s -> 785.06s]  range is indicated by the color-changing cursor. Color-changing cursor. Oh, okay. All right. Let's
[785.06s -> 792.26s]  look at the bed. Just woke up. Radio Unitra. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Look
[792.26s -> 796.26s]  more than an ass. Oh, the radio has been silent for years. Although sometimes I think it can
[796.26s -> 809.06s]  hear voices through the static. I guess. I don't know. Wardrobe. There we go. All right. I know
[809.06s -> 818.17s]  these notes by heart. I don't want to... What did it say? Quickly produced moonshine. Barely filtered.
[818.17s -> 831.80s]  So what does this do? Board. Matchstick. Rag. Key. Where'd it go? What? My medical book. I thought
[831.80s -> 836.25s]  that was a picture of... I thought that was a picture of me for a second. I don't know why I
[836.25s -> 841.67s]  thought it for one second. Okay. So this is some kind of illness that's been spreading.
[842.47s -> 852.62s]  Okay. Anything else in the book? All right. Hold on. Board. Matchstick. Can I like use the
[852.62s -> 860.15s]  board as a weapon? All right. I have the board selected so I can just like cross somebody in
[860.15s -> 867.90s]  the head with this, right? All right. Well, I got the key. Locked. I think I left the key in
[867.90s -> 874.70s]  the wardrobe. I have the key on me. How do I get in my inventory? The cursor has a plus icon next
[874.70s -> 884.60s]  to it. You can hold left mouse button to open the selected object's action menu. Got it. All right.
[884.60s -> 899.58s]  I'm ready. This is a dog. What do I do? Wait. Hammer. Can I use the hammer? Destroyed well.
[900.62s -> 904.71s]  Rope. This is a survival game. I don't have to survive in this game.
[906.71s -> 913.75s]  My 125p. It used to be a luxury, but since all the access roads have been devoured by the woods,
[913.75s -> 921.66s]  it became a useless pile of trash. The People's Tribune. Daily newspaper of the Polish People's
[921.66s -> 932.95s]  Republic. Okay. To Edward Geirich. Oh, this is not English. Something about the United States
[932.95s -> 948.39s]  right here. Anybody read Polish? I don't know what that says. Deduced. My dog. I don't think
[948.39s -> 954.94s]  he's going to make it. I should end his suffering. No! No, not the dog. Immediately you're going to
[954.94s -> 963.34s]  throw the dog at me. I don't know what to do. How? Wooden doll. A large humanoid dog with a carved
[963.34s -> 979.94s]  out face. Okay. That was like loud. I don't like this. Barricaded window. So what's the point?
[979.94s -> 985.96s]  What's over here? Do I actually have to walk through the dark woods? Is that the whole point?
[986.68s -> 995.99s]  I don't know what to do about the dog. I really don't know what to do. For a space to vault over
[995.99s -> 1012.49s]  obstacles like fences or windows. It's the title. You said the title. Can I like alcohol? No. Like
[1012.49s -> 1025.24s]  I can't. I don't know what to do. Oh, it's actually you actually have to vault. Okay.
[1026.12s -> 1029.86s]  I got to put both headphones in for this because people are going to scream at me.
[1030.58s -> 1049.18s]  All right. Go east. Do I have a compass? I got an axe. All right. Axe. A formidable weapon. Oh,
[1049.18s -> 1058.09s]  sick. Okay. So you hold right, you hold right trigger and you get a cursor and you just
[1058.09s -> 1066.52s]  overhead swing into things. Do I cut down trees? I don't think so. All right. Go east. This is
[1066.52s -> 1069.88s]  south. Although I don't know which way I'm facing. So it could be, it could be anything.
[1071.99s -> 1096.07s]  Dog, dog, dog, dog. Oh, I don't want to do this though. Oh, I'm sorry. Be at peace.
[1096.63s -> 1105.90s]  I missed. I'm sorry. Be at peace. Oh my God. I can't even do it. I'm sorry. Be at peace.
[1110.25s -> 1118.23s]  I'm not doing a very good job. This is fucking embarrassing. My dog. I don't think he's gonna
[1118.23s -> 1129.08s]  make it. I should end his suffering. I don't know how to do that. What do you mean you don't know
[1129.08s -> 1142.28s]  how to do that? I left click dog. My dog. Middle mouse. I don't know how to do that. Right click.
[1142.84s -> 1147.40s]  He won't swing. No, this is not an all right scenario. This is a horrible scenario.
[1147.96s -> 1159.26s]  Uh, Freddie Dredd just gave 10,000 bits. Here's some bits for your boy. Thank you for streaming.
[1160.06s -> 1181.40s]  Then left click. I don't like this game. All right. So I don't like this game. I'm gonna do
[1181.40s -> 1186.90s]  the coloring book instead. Uh, but thank you, Freddie Dredd for the 10,000 bits. Really appreciate
[1186.90s -> 1193.67s]  it. So it's not hold and let go. It's hold and then left click. And then Clown Daddy just gave
[1193.67s -> 1198.63s]  five community subs. Thank you for the five community subs. Appreciate it. With a weapon
[1198.63s -> 1204.02s]  selected in your hot. I just had to walk five feet. Uh, with a weapon in your hot bar,
[1204.02s -> 1207.86s]  hold right mouse button to take aim, then press left while aiming to attack. Okay. Sure. Right.
[1208.82s -> 1218.49s]  Tree. Knock down the tree. Loud. Too loud. I don't like how loud this is. All right. These trees are
[1218.49s -> 1227.38s]  growing too fast. Soon. I won't be able to cut them down fast enough. Bear trap. Pick it up.
[1227.38s -> 1236.68s]  Okay. Dead cow cow bone. Uh, all right. I got a cow bone. Does the weapons have, weapons have
[1236.68s -> 1246.54s]  durability. Look at that. It's already like almost done. What about up here? Left shift. What does
[1246.54s -> 1257.26s]  that say? Left shift? What left shift? Run location found path. What are you talking about? Location
[1257.26s -> 1268.01s]  found. All right. Where's East? I'm going East, right? I can hear shit behind me. What does that
[1268.01s -> 1272.63s]  mean? Is this the radio on silent hill? When you start to hear like the weird echoey music,
[1272.63s -> 1274.95s]  it means that there's something like a monster or something, right? I'm going to get ready.
[1275.83s -> 1285.24s]  To access the map, press M. This is like an, this is like a stomach and intestinal track.
[1285.88s -> 1292.30s]  This is where I am. Your position on the map is not marked. When you discover a new location,
[1292.30s -> 1300.44s]  it will be added to your map. The location you are currently in is indicated in red. In order not to
[1300.44s -> 1305.24s]  get lost, you need to learn how to determine your position relative to the discovered locations and
[1305.32s -> 1313.99s]  landmarks. All right, so I'm here. I got to go down. Oh, this is gonna be, I'm so glad I have
[1313.99s -> 1320.73s]  you guys here. I'm so happy you guys are here. You guys can help me. The woods have been, have
[1320.73s -> 1324.97s]  devoured all the roads that connected us to the outside world. No one is able to pass through this
[1324.97s -> 1339.58s]  thicket. Unless they had an axe, of course. I'm gonna, I've, I've drank like two cups of coffee
[1339.58s -> 1345.02s]  today. So I'm already really jumpy. Just to make sure everybody's aware of that. I'm so glad I have
[1345.02s -> 1350.30s]  a limiter on my mic now because like I'm gonna scream at some point probably. It's gonna be so
[1350.30s -> 1357.02s]  loud, but I have a limiter. What's this? Burns campfire. To immediately transfer items between
[1357.02s -> 1362.94s]  inventories, hold left control or left shift when clicking. Okay. Can I have, can I have more than
[1362.94s -> 1372.04s]  one rag? How many boards can I have? Seven. How many matches can I have? 21. How many rags can I
[1372.04s -> 1380.23s]  have in one stack? Five. What do I do with these though? Should I go up? Wait, where am I? Okay,
[1380.23s -> 1399.51s]  I'm here. There's an up, wait, check down here. What's that? Oh, there's light over there. Happy
[1399.51s -> 1407.72s]  Halloween, by the way, guys. Do a tuber voice. Why would I do a tuber voice right now? These parts
[1407.72s -> 1417.13s]  of the woods are dark. I should craft a torch. Tab is your, this wasn't here before. Uh, crafting
[1417.21s -> 1426.12s]  torch. You have seven boards. You need one, one, one. It's okay. Craft a torch. How many should I
[1426.12s -> 1435.35s]  make? Should I make one in one? What's a super torch? Oh, this is a gasoline torch. Okay.
[1437.24s -> 1447.22s]  All right. So I have, okay. So did, okay. I can, all right. You can swing this. Oh, for the love
[1447.22s -> 1461.19s]  of God. I have to switch weapons. Can I kill people with the torch? I hope so. Where am I?
[1461.93s -> 1472.50s]  I don't know. Up. I have to go up. Abandoned house. Where is the house? Where's the, oh,
[1472.50s -> 1476.66s]  it's right here. There's a wall here. All right. I got to be ready. I got ready to burn a motherfucker.
[1477.30s -> 1482.94s]  No, don't barricade this door. Go in. Should I be going, should I go in here?
[1486.22s -> 1495.86s]  Chair. Wardrobe. Oh shit. There's rags in here. Nice. Bread. I'm out of space.
[1496.82s -> 1502.90s]  Rag. Should I make, I'm going to make some more torches. I think that's what I'm going to do.
[1506.06s -> 1518.04s]  Right? Yeah. How long does this last? Matchstick torch. Torch. Can I stack them?
[1519.64s -> 1524.41s]  I can't stack the torches. What about bone? They last for 20 minutes. All right. What about the
[1524.41s -> 1529.69s]  pills? What about the board? Turn the lights on. This is post-apocalyptic world. There's no lights.
[1531.40s -> 1540.18s]  I kind of want to take this stuff though. Rag. Bread. I need to take this bread. Why am I saying
[1540.26s -> 1548.26s]  so fucking strangely? Bread. Bread. Bread. Rope torch. Should I just eat the bread? I'm dying
[1548.26s -> 1556.90s]  right now. Why do I have health? How do I eat it? Your lungs are more efficient because you ate
[1556.90s -> 1570.65s]  bread. What? Did I inhale it? How do you save the game? Is there a save? Okay. There's somebody
[1570.65s -> 1586.39s]  like out here. Hit the X. I get the fuck out of here. All right. I'm out. I got, I ate the bread.
[1586.39s -> 1594.47s]  That means I'm not hungry anymore. Is there a save? There's no save. All right. Where the fuck
[1594.47s -> 1601.99s]  am I? All right. There's the house. I got to go right. Can I vault? Can I climb this? I don't
[1601.99s -> 1617.18s]  think I can climb that. Can I go through here? You can only save at a cooking station. All right. Up
[1617.18s -> 1622.97s]  maybe. Over here. Because I came from this way though. I'm already lost in the woods. I have no
[1622.97s -> 1639.85s]  idea where I'm going. All right. This thing's going to get up. In a few days it will be completely
[1639.85s -> 1648.07s]  absorbed. Absorbed into what? Clothes. Fucking rags. I don't, I don't know. I don't want it to,
[1648.07s -> 1657.03s]  I don't know what to do with the rags. Clothes. Searched. Yep. More rags. There's a deer over here
[1657.03s -> 1674.39s]  or an elk or a moose. I don't know. Whatever this is supposed to be. Ah, I hate it. Clothes. Rags. I
[1674.39s -> 1682.47s]  don't need rags. My medical bag? It's useless. So it's worth, but it's worth a hundred bucks.
[1683.19s -> 1692.46s]  I don't understand. Why is it worth so much money? Who do you sell stuff to in this game?
[1693.50s -> 1711.06s]  All right. Made it through this. I haven't been in here though. Doorway. Repair. Search these clothes.
[1711.06s -> 1717.78s]  More rags. I don't, I wish there would be more than five stacks. A bottle? An empty glass bottle?
[1717.78s -> 1731.82s]  I don't think I need this stuff. More rags. What am I going to do with these rags? They're coming.
[1731.82s -> 1742.47s]  Who's coming? No one's coming. Don't say that. Don't say they're coming. So I gotta go up.
[1743.99s -> 1758.60s]  All right. Slow down. I can't run that. All right. Guy. Guy over here. Do I have to put this, put this
[1758.60s -> 1768.58s]  guy at peace too? I probably, I'm walking over with an axe, but still. I think this one is still
[1768.58s -> 1778.74s]  breathing. Be at peace. Can I talk? Big metal key. If there is an exit out of these woods, this key
[1778.74s -> 1788.94s]  will surely open it. Number 21. He's unconscious. I've never seen him around here before. It's me.
[1788.94s -> 1801.66s]  It's gonna be me. He's only carrying a key and some journal. Since he managed to sneak in here,
[1801.66s -> 1819.24s]  he must know how to get out. Of course he won't help me voluntarily. So wrench. That is of no
[1819.24s -> 1839.91s]  importance. I need to get out of this accursed forest. You hear me? Rat! Where's the rat? Show
[1839.99s -> 1856.95s]  me how and I will let you go. I sometimes hear her voice. She's calling me. Calling me to return
[1856.95s -> 1877.93s]  home. Where is the exit? Am I interrogating this person? Where's the exit? Show me where. I don't
[1877.93s -> 1881.29s]  even know if, for all I know this could be just some person that just like went wandering in the
[1881.29s -> 1898.33s]  woods. Hey! I'll kill you like a dog if I have to. So I'm the bad, I'm the bad guy. What if you don't
[1898.33s -> 1909.16s]  kill the dog? I'm the, I knew I was the bad guy and now I'm this guy. Yep. And now I gotta kill me
[1909.16s -> 1916.18s]  who was me in the tutorial. You got it. That fucker stole my key. And enter into a small cell and
[1916.18s -> 1921.22s]  maybe the pantry. Let's get in. Use the lockpick. I have lockpick. Search. I couldn't open it with a
[1921.22s -> 1925.78s]  lockpick. I could open it with a lockpick. Okay. Crafting. I can make a lockpick. How do I make a
[1925.78s -> 1933.85s]  lockpick? One lockpick is two lockpicks. What? Why would two lockpicks make one lockpick?
[1935.69s -> 1943.38s]  Needs two, oh, it's like wire. Oh, that's not what it, okay. All right. Hey, uh, hey, my stomach
[1943.38s -> 1948.82s]  hurts. I'm gonna puke in here, man. Fucking best way to do it. All right. Let's see what else we got.
[1949.54s -> 1960.98s]  The barricade's too strong. All right. Easy. Let's make that lockpick and get out of here.
[1963.98s -> 1970.38s]  Neat. Okay. Lockpick. I can always make gauze. Heals wounds. All right. Let's use that. Nice
[1970.38s -> 1978.94s]  tutorial. Teach me how to use gauze. Okay. So use gauze. You, okay. Use. Using it. All right.
[1978.94s -> 1988.23s]  Lockpick. Let's do it. Unlocked. What's in the container? A shovel. It's heavy, but it has good
[1988.23s -> 2001.27s]  reach and a flashlight. All right. So I got to bash this guy's head in with the shovel.
[2001.91s -> 2008.25s]  It's too strong to dismantle. So just smash it down. All right. Does he hear that?
[2008.25s -> 2025.37s]  The item is no longer usable. Okay. I'm out. Wait, he was right in front of me. He was literally
[2025.37s -> 2037.98s]  right there. Okay. It took me so long to register that he was standing there. Holy shit. My, like,
[2037.98s -> 2052.76s]  pee brain. That's supposed to scare you immediately. And it took me, syringe. Fuck. Can I hit him with
[2052.76s -> 2061.61s]  the flashlight? I better not leave the house at night. It's safer here. Is this just a series of
[2061.69s -> 2064.41s]  taking the house from the person who squatted in the house before you?
[2065.45s -> 2078.78s]  What the fuck is this guy? Lamp. Turn the lamp on. Turn it on. How many batteries are in this
[2078.78s -> 2093.32s]  flashlight? Oh, there's a code. Please let me out. What? There's other people in here. All right.
[2093.32s -> 2103.10s]  Hold on. What is that? Is it a bomb? I think it's a bomb. All right. Don't touch this. It's a bomb.
[2103.10s -> 2108.14s]  That's a bomb. That's a bomb. Right? Stuff doesn't blink red unless it's a bomb.
[2109.78s -> 2118.62s]  Dismantle the bomb. Turn. All right. It's not a bomb. It's a radio. No, it's a bomb. Right?
[2118.62s -> 2136.18s]  Why is it connected over here? How do I get the fucking thing open? What about over here? This is
[2136.18s -> 2146.42s]  connected to this. Lamp on. Search the... What's going on? Can I punch? This is the... The radio
[2146.42s -> 2152.12s]  needs to be dialed to like a certain frequency, right? And then the frequency will open the door.
[2152.76s -> 2187.38s]  Oh, that was fucking easy. All right. Watch out. Somebody in here? Somebody in there? There's like
[2187.38s -> 2191.86s]  a torture device in here. All right. Generator. Don't turn it on yet. That's going to activate
[2191.86s -> 2202.55s]  everything. Meal table. A meal table with leather belt strapped on. Metal table. A meal... A meal
[2202.55s -> 2212.04s]  table. What's in here? Why did everything turn off? This is going to be somebody in here. He's
[2212.04s -> 2225.43s]  going to be in this box. Okay. No, there's nobody in the box. It's just gasoline. Table leg. Use it
[2225.43s -> 2232.66s]  as a weapon. You got it. Uh, I'm going to keep the shovel though, just in case I need it. Fuck
[2232.66s -> 2239.69s]  out of here. I need the code. How do I get the code to let the other person out? Generator on.
[2239.69s -> 2243.53s]  Let's go. To refill the generator, click the gasoline tank. Cover your mouse over the generator.
[2243.53s -> 2246.25s]  Hold right mouse button, followed by the left mouse button to pour the gasoline. All right.
[2246.25s -> 2263.05s]  I'm going to smash this guy's head in. How much do I have to refill it? I have to refill it that
[2263.05s -> 2275.99s]  much. Incoming joke alert. Incoming joke alert. Oh man. I've been playing wow for like fucking
[2275.99s -> 2284.34s]  six hours. When am I going to get to 60? Everybody fucking laugh immediately at that hilarious
[2284.34s -> 2303.62s]  fucking wow reference. Yes. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Actually pay attention.
[2304.71s -> 2324.87s]  Not funny. Didn't laugh. Yes, you fucking did. I saw it. I told you it was a bomb. The corpse
[2324.87s -> 2329.11s]  has two dials instead of eyes. His mouth is wide open and I can hear a distorted voice.
[2329.11s -> 2333.03s]  Barely distinguishable from the radio static. Turn on the generator. Turn on the generator.
[2334.15s -> 2350.30s]  Wait, it's not on. All right. He's going to get up. Right. I'm ready. I'm ready. Right. When he
[2350.30s -> 2355.38s]  comes up, this is going right in his head. The corpse has two dials. His mouth. I can hear it.
[2356.50s -> 2386.73s]  Barely just come from radio static. 4892. 4892. Okay. 4892. Got it. Who the fuck's in here?
[2387.45s -> 2413.53s]  Door seems stuck. I need to apply some force to it. Help me. You don't say come closer if you need
[2413.53s -> 2418.01s]  help. That's like what the witches and the fucking bad guys from Disney movies tell you.
[2424.28s -> 2444.54s]  I knew it. You fucking Disney witch. I didn't even know there was a corner there really. I just saw
[2444.54s -> 2467.13s]  it. Plastic chick. It's a bomb. This is a bomb. Oh, who's laughing? Right. And how do you will
[2467.13s -> 2476.14s]  want to get out now? You think you can man age all by yourself? Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
[2478.49s -> 2492.36s]  Hear it. Next motherfucker that comes near me is getting blocked in the fucking head. Who's in the
[2492.36s -> 2495.88s]  house? Somebody coming in the house right now. All right. I got to get out of the house, I think.
[2497.88s -> 2521.51s]  Did I lose? Or is that script? That's script. That was fucking terrifying. I hate fucking two
[2521.51s -> 2533.74s]  headphones. Now this is too loud. I have to drop this. It's too much. I was stretching the hand.
[2538.92s -> 2543.14s]  Leave the volume. No, it's too loud for me. It's too loud for you guys. Chapter one.
[2543.78s -> 2548.76s]  Don't do it or I'll leave. What? Don't turn the volume down a little bit so you'll leave?
[2549.80s -> 2561.91s]  Is this me again? All right. I have no stuff. Bandages with alcohol. Good for heavy wounds.
[2565.62s -> 2569.86s]  A pleasant worth is emanating from the oven. I can sense a strange yet familiar scent.
[2570.50s -> 2575.70s]  It's the smell of the protective substance, which gives me relative safety after dark.
[2576.71s -> 2580.95s]  The vapors rising from the huge cauldron are distributed all over the house via long pipes.
[2581.59s -> 2584.87s]  As long as I remain inside my hideout, I have a chance of surviving the night.
[2585.43s -> 2590.63s]  Examine the oven. Look at the weird bottle. Let's examine that. When I arrived here a couple days
[2590.63s -> 2595.27s]  ago, the oven was basically prepared. I just needed to light it up to ensure my safety at night.
[2595.83s -> 2602.49s]  This cottage must have been one of our hideouts. One of our hideouts. The inhabitants of these
[2602.49s -> 2610.31s]  woods don't need to inhale this revolting gas. Well, it's a weird bottle. The label on the bottle
[2610.31s -> 2615.83s]  says staying out of the reach of the protective substance after nightfall results in immediate
[2615.83s -> 2621.99s]  death in 99 out of 100 cases. It's advised to evenly spread the gas inside the sleeping area.
[2622.87s -> 2632.04s]  Okay, so you have to be in the gas. Warning! Even a properly prepared substance does not guarantee
[2632.04s -> 2637.80s]  100% safety. Remain vigilant. It is recommended to stay in well-lit indoor areas in order to
[2637.80s -> 2646.89s]  minimize the risk. So we need to have set up a stove that has gas coming out of it.
[2646.89s -> 2650.81s]  A small empty cast iron pot. I haven't used it yet. I haven't felt any hunger or thirst
[2650.81s -> 2656.09s]  since the accident a few days ago. I can't stop thinking about one thing. These mushrooms,
[2656.09s -> 2661.53s]  these red pulsating mushrooms, they look so tasty. Maybe this pot will prove useful after all.
[2662.25s -> 2677.18s]  Oven efficiency one. You just make a giant mushroom syringe? Holy shit. Okay, well, I don't
[2677.18s -> 2686.66s]  have anything. This is essence. Dose one. That's, oh, that's what you meant when you said cooking
[2686.66s -> 2693.24s]  saved the game. I see. All right, let's go. Turn the lamp on. I can't even turn anything. Wardrobe.
[2693.24s -> 2700.12s]  Nothing in there except there's a nail. Use that as a weapon. I don't think I can. Rag. And photo of
[2700.12s -> 2716.09s]  road. The road home. Wooden door. I think this is fairly safe in here, but I've been wrong. It's
[2716.09s -> 2721.50s]  okay. And cranky dog shit. Yesterday I barricaded one of the windows. If I want to stay for some
[2721.50s -> 2737.21s]  time, I should do the same with the other windows. Okay, done. Workbench. Repair. I know, man, this
[2737.21s -> 2745.72s]  is gonna get, this is gonna get nasty for me. Hotbar upgrade. So I get more slots. I need one
[2745.72s -> 2758.74s]  blanket and one wire. Board with nails. Antidote cures poison. Gas bottle. Okay. Upgrade workshop.
[2758.74s -> 2765.02s]  I need six boards. I need, okay. All right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's just hold on. I can't
[2765.02s -> 2778.87s]  board these up. Large mushrooms. Harvest them. Got it. Odd looking mushroom. Cookable. Okay.
[2783.50s -> 2788.70s]  All right. Y'all are gonna think I'm insane for doing this, but I'm gonna bind sprint to
[2788.94s -> 2793.02s]  one of my mouse buttons. I mean, I know y'all are gonna think I'm insane for doing that,
[2793.02s -> 2808.36s]  but I have to. Okay. Sprint. Run. Left shift. No. It's gonna be mouse button five.
[2809.08s -> 2818.07s]  That's a thousand times better. So now if I want to go left and sprint, I don't have to hit A and
[2818.07s -> 2825.82s]  then shift with my pinky. Much better. Got it. All right. Is this a streamer that sprints with his
[2825.82s -> 2835.06s]  mouse? Yes. All right. So we've got mushroom. Oh, wait. What'd I just do? Is this like to level
[2835.06s -> 2844.89s]  up your health or something? Yeah. It's, uh, you, you collect mushrooms and you put it in there and
[2844.89s -> 2852.74s]  you level it up. Yeah. Right here. Check this out. Harvest these and then I can, I fill it up with
[2852.74s -> 2858.60s]  syringe and then syringe myself in the neck and I'll get another bar of HP. Got it. So they've
[2858.60s -> 2862.20s]  wrought over time though, which is trying to figure out what that means, how long that takes.
[2863.16s -> 2873.19s]  I'll look for a couple more of these things. What's that? Night. You are in the hideout
[2873.19s -> 2876.31s]  under the influence of the protective substance. It will help you survive. Okay.
[2877.43s -> 2891.08s]  Build a well. I don't want to build a fucking well. Saw. Use a saw. Convert wood logs to planks.
[2891.96s -> 2902.41s]  Okay. I can make planks. Do I have to like fall out for this house? Is that what's going on here?
[2903.29s -> 2912.60s]  I want another mushroom. They're going to map too. All right. Underground entrance.
[2912.60s -> 2917.50s]  That's the X. That's where I got to go. Right? What's the mission? What's the goal of the whole
[2917.50s -> 2934.66s]  game? I don't know. Let me put that mushroom back in here. All right. They're worth 10 each.
[2937.22s -> 2944.58s]  Escape the forest. All right. Sounds easy enough. I need to barricade this though. Look at how
[2944.58s -> 2952.76s]  fucked up this is. Wait, what's in here? This generator is half empty. It contains enough
[2952.76s -> 2957.88s]  gasoline for one more night. I should find a full can in the house above the underground entrance.
[2960.28s -> 2965.88s]  Oh shit. You have some stuff on you. Got a torch on you. Thanks, man.
[2966.84s -> 2970.71s]  Native weapons have secondary attack. Try it by pressing mouse four.
[2971.91s -> 2980.25s]  Okay. It's an overhead swing. All right. Now I need to get the gas that's under the
[2980.25s -> 2986.41s]  underground entrance. Say that again one more time. I have enough for one more night.
[2988.62s -> 2998.31s]  That's not good. Okay. I can't sprint around everywhere. Don't waste the torch. Oh, sorry.
[2998.95s -> 3002.90s]  So how do I get over there? There's an underground entrance.
[3003.96s -> 3025.19s]  There's a full can of gas over here. Where? Full can of gas? There's a dog. Is it a
[3025.19s -> 3029.67s]  is it a poisoned dog? Or is it a regular? Sounds like a regular dog.
[3047.91s -> 3054.63s]  Okay. Dog. Is it a regular dog or is it an infected dog? Is there a difference in this game?
[3055.35s -> 3063.91s]  Is that an affected dog? Is this dog affected? You don't sound infected.
[3070.73s -> 3075.19s]  Get out of here.
[3088.49s -> 3099.61s]  God damn it. Where's the underground entrance? I need to find the full can of gasoline or I'm
[3099.61s -> 3107.03s]  not going to be able to survive another night. Oh, that's where I am. I have to go up into the left.
[3109.72s -> 3112.36s]  Loot the dog. The dog is still alive. I can't loot the dog.
[3119.37s -> 3123.16s]  Is there a beetle? There are more than one dog now.
[3136.86s -> 3142.47s]  I need to get the gasoline or I can't do this. Gasoline. All right. I'm going this way.
[3143.27s -> 3153.94s]  There's always a bigger dog. Just don't go near the dogs. I don't know what the fuck they are.
[3153.94s -> 3158.50s]  They're just like hanging out. They're just in random spots. Okay. I need to go this way.
[3158.50s -> 3161.78s]  Underground entrance. Get me up there. I'm just going to run away from the dogs if I see them.
[3162.50s -> 3170.78s]  Is it nighttime? This is the sun's out. Is the sun out right? All right. There's a dog.
[3171.42s -> 3186.10s]  Why did they just... Okay. I'm here. Underground entrance. Where is it? Underground entrance. I'm
[3186.10s -> 3193.03s]  here. Where's the underground entrance? Found it right there. Don't step on the bear trap
[3193.59s -> 3215.66s]  and give it to me. Okay. Is this it? Am I in like a zone I'm not supposed to be in?
[3216.46s -> 3227.45s]  Bear trap. If I climb through this window, I'll get... I'll step in it and I don't want to step
[3227.45s -> 3234.01s]  in that. Why can I... I cannot punch. This is the house. I'll find the entrance to the underground
[3234.01s -> 3241.19s]  here and I'm not bleeding so I'll be okay for a little while. I gotta get more mushrooms.
[3248.36s -> 3256.63s]  Watch it for this shit. I'm going to step in this. The cyclops are currently supposed to eat.
[3256.63s -> 3270.74s]  Eat. I don't have anything. Oh, I can make another bandage. Not as well. Bed. Backpack.
[3271.54s -> 3274.68s]  Ooh, nice. Okay. Bread. Pills. What do the pills do?
[3275.88s -> 3280.12s]  Medium caliber. But there's guns in this game? And a battery? Wait, there's guns.
[3285.50s -> 3296.28s]  Ooh, shit. All right. Lockpick. Nail. A couple of rags. There it is. Full gasoline. Pack of...
[3296.28s -> 3310.76s]  I thought that was... It's a pack of cigarettes. Looks like an apple. Oh, that's why it looks
[3310.76s -> 3318.84s]  like that. Okay. I guess it's just an interesting thing to find. All right. I got the... Do I have
[3318.84s -> 3325.90s]  a weapon? I have a weapon, right? Do I have a weapon? I don't have any weapon. Make a torch
[3327.10s -> 3340.31s]  and a bandage. Fuck. Okay, move this. Am I stuck here? No, not anymore.
[3350.39s -> 3359.56s]  Oh, it's these mushrooms. Nice. Okay, good. You used... Wait, what are you talking about? What?
[3367.50s -> 3379.10s]  I used the gasoline? Why did I use the gasoline? I dumped it on the torch? Why would I do that?
[3382.28s -> 3395.22s]  Wow. I thought it was a person. I thought there was a specific gasoline torch. It's a red one. I
[3395.22s -> 3404.34s]  don't have a red one in my inventory. See? Like gasoline torch. Look. Oh, I made that one. Well,
[3404.90s -> 3408.26s]  fuck. Is that going to be the mistake that ends this whole thing and I have to restart the whole
[3408.26s -> 3422.84s]  game? Tell me now. Okay, I'm going to examine it. The entrance to the underground tunnels.
[3424.39s -> 3429.99s]  I don't have any stuff. Why am I... How am I going to do anything down here? At least the game saved.
[3430.71s -> 3439.35s]  I have a mushroom. I don't want to... I can't... I don't know. What am I looking for down here?
[3439.35s -> 3444.62s]  I don't even know what I'm trying to do down here. What's the point of down here?
[3445.42s -> 3458.06s]  I need a torch. I have a... Wait a minute. You're telling me that the torch with the gasoline on it...
[3458.06s -> 3475.32s]  Oh, it's alcohol, technically. Rubble. The tunnel walls were crushed by enormous roots. Dig.
[3476.28s -> 3489.21s]  I don't have a shovel. Shit. Nothing over here. Let's keep going. Go home. Go home. Go home. Go
[3489.21s -> 3494.97s]  home. Should I go home? A light bulb dimly lits the wet walls of the underground passage. The
[3494.97s -> 3499.21s]  further part is shrouded in complete darkness. I need a light source to continue. Keep going. Go.
[3500.26s -> 3507.29s]  Go home. The thick wooded posts barely hold the soap brown and the tangled roots. The construction
[3507.29s -> 3526.47s]  seems on the verge of collapse. I'm going home. I'm going... I'm at her. I'm going home. Okay.
[3526.47s -> 3533.51s]  I have mushrooms to deposit into my mushroom syringe bank. Okay, now I gotta go this way.
[3534.07s -> 3548.82s]  There's a dog. Where the fuck are these dogs? Out here into the right... Wait, what's up here?
[3549.62s -> 3557.86s]  I'm so glad I have this stereo audio so that I can hear where they're coming from.
[3558.58s -> 3566.12s]  All right, I'm just gonna go. I gotta deposit that mushroom and then I'm gonna make a... I need to
[3566.12s -> 3576.90s]  make a weapon or something. I have to barricade boards and windows and... This way. What... What
[3576.90s -> 3590.44s]  day is it? What time is it? Do I even have that knowledge right now? Oh, you motherfucker. Where
[3590.44s -> 3610.31s]  are you? Is there any way I can see what time it is? All right. So, generator. Gasoline. Fill it up.
[3610.87s -> 3627.02s]  Okay, here we go. Right? This is what I'm supposed to be doing. Right? I'm going for it. And I'm going
[3627.02s -> 3642.89s]  to assume that the bar is a day. One of those bars is one day worth of fuel. Right? Okay. So,
[3642.89s -> 3649.78s]  I have two days, two and a half days worth of fuel. Now, climb over here. There's probably like a
[3649.78s -> 3659.99s]  creeper in the house now because I haven't barricaded any windows. The bear trap under the window is
[3659.99s -> 3663.75s]  still open. Looks like this night was exceptionally uneventful. I didn't put that there, did I?
[3664.15s -> 3672.04s]  Okay. Oh, fuck. There's stuff in here. Okay. Rope. Two pieces of alcohol, two pieces of bottle,
[3672.04s -> 3681.59s]  and a mushroom book. The title reads, The Use of Mushrooms in the Household. That's what it was.
[3681.59s -> 3689.61s]  People are doing shrooms and giving themselves this like post-apocalyptic disease. All right.
[3689.61s -> 3700.62s]  We're almost there. Two more. Game is saved. Now, I need to craft some stuff. Bandages with alcohol.
[3702.82s -> 3709.06s]  Battery. Do I have a stash or anything? Can I stash? I can stash this stuff in here.
[3711.30s -> 3721.29s]  Right? I can just put it in here. All right. Well, I don't need half of this stuff. I can
[3721.29s -> 3728.41s]  put the pills in here. Scrap metal. Is there a way I can just control and do it? Yeah. Okay.
[3728.97s -> 3734.01s]  I'm going to keep the lockpick. Keep the alcohol. I'll keep one alcohol, one rag.
[3734.97s -> 3739.85s]  Keep the bread. I don't need the rope. Do I need these things? I don't know if I need these things.
[3739.93s -> 3753.85s]  Or not. I have no idea. Nails? What do they do? I don't know. Check your journal. Items. Keys.
[3753.85s -> 3761.08s]  Journal. Me. Skills. You. Skills. Okay. So I need. I don't have any planks though.
[3763.86s -> 3777.05s]  Varricade. Varricade. I need three planks. I don't have any planks. Let's look at planks.
[3778.63s -> 3783.99s]  All right. I think I'm. I need a weapon. There's a sandwich outside. There's not a sandwich outside.
[3783.99s -> 3798.86s]  I guarantee it. What do I have to do with this stuff? Lock all the doors with furniture.
[3799.50s -> 3819.43s]  That's what I was thinking. Wait. Otherwise people can get in here. See what I mean? Like,
[3819.43s -> 3828.39s]  people can get in that. Planks. I'm going to go on a plank mission. Can I move the bed?
[3829.03s -> 3838.95s]  I cannot drag the bed. All right. I got. Let me consolidate. So empty bottle. I'm getting
[3838.95s -> 3846.34s]  rid of this. Back to my stash. Turn. Turn on the generator. Turn the generator on. Why?
[3847.06s -> 3855.18s]  What are you talking about? I'll fucking have to. No. Leave that. Generator. Generator. Generator.
[3855.18s -> 3870.68s]  Generator. I'm going. What? Everybody just relax. Look. Hey. There we go. How I. I mean,
[3870.68s -> 3880.76s]  it's kind of annoying. Should I save energy? Does it burn? I don't want to just leave my lights on
[3880.76s -> 3896.90s]  and leave the house. Doesn't that sound bad? Keep them on. All right. Don't leave during the night.
[3896.90s -> 3904.12s]  What the fuck? Don't leave during the night. What the fuck? So what do I just hang out? How
[3904.12s -> 3921.02s]  do I? Can I sleep at night? How do you sleep? So I just have to hang out here. Stay safe until
[3921.02s -> 3933.26s]  daytime comes. What was my watch? I don't even know what time it is. You wait, fucker. Oh my
[3933.26s -> 3962.71s]  goodness. This is because I'm looking over here. I'm looking over at you guys and everyone's like,
[3962.71s -> 3967.35s]  just hang out in the house. Hang out in the house. Don't step on the fucking bear trap.
[3968.28s -> 3971.56s]  You knew it was going to happen like once, right? Like it was going to happen one time.
[3971.56s -> 3979.30s]  It might as well happen once. I thought somebody threw an axe through the window. I really thought
[3979.30s -> 3986.54s]  somebody threw an object at me. All right. Stop. Am I bleeding? How do you tell if you're bleeding?
[3986.54s -> 4003.96s]  Go near the light, please. I just stepped in a fucking bear trap. There's no more bears.
[4003.96s -> 4006.92s]  I'm not setting traps. I'm not setting bear traps. Go to the light. All right. All right.
[4006.92s -> 4018.92s]  All right. I'm next to the light. I'm fine. And now I'm going to heal. There. There's nobody in
[4018.92s -> 4038.14s]  the house, right? There's nobody in here. Did that say possible mushroom? Poisonous mushrooms.
[4041.74s -> 4050.92s]  Why is it coming out of the ground? What? That was possible mushrooms. I was right. Okay. Mushrooms.
[4052.71s -> 4056.15s]  What's that sound? What's that sound? What's that? Stand next to the light. Next to the light.
[4057.75s -> 4077.42s]  Just put a ton of light over here. I hear somebody sprinting. Get the fuck away from me. Do I need
[4077.42s -> 4095.46s]  the torch? No, I have this. I'm just going to drag it around with me. Be quiet. I'm standing in a
[4095.46s -> 4109.53s]  gigantic halogen light bulb. It's too dangerous to cook during the night. Close the door. I can't.
[4110.09s -> 4120.18s]  Okay. I can. Close the door. That one is barricaded. Is there something going to come in here?
[4120.74s -> 4134.57s]  I don't have any barricades. No. I don't even know what that means. Wait. Somebody said the
[4134.57s -> 4139.46s]  first night's not bad. What? Is this like Five Nights at Freddy's? Is by like night four there's
[4139.46s -> 4155.93s]  going to be random fucking animatronics running around this house? Great. How many days? How many
[4155.93s -> 4163.61s]  days until like somebody else has to take the shift? Look outside. I'm not looking outside.
[4163.61s -> 4186.26s]  Someone's going to grab me through the window. No. How do I know it's daytime? Look around the
[4186.26s -> 4191.29s]  corner. All right. I'm going to bring my fucking light source with me so I don't get in trouble.
[4202.20s -> 4206.44s]  Is this like holy water? Is this going to burn them or something? Why isn't music doing this?
[4227.06s -> 4235.54s]  I did it. I survived today. All right. Now turn the generator off. I don't need this light anymore.
[4238.46s -> 4247.43s]  Look at how fucking much that's too much. I need gasoline. Okay. All it needs is to have to just go.
[4263.13s -> 4270.92s]  Okay. Quickly. Quickly. Wood legs. Nothing in there. I need to go now. Clock. Time freeze. Why?
[4270.92s -> 4276.76s]  We need time freeze. Why is time frozen? I have like a time. I get a setup phase. There's an NPC
[4276.76s -> 4287.64s]  in here. What? Where? Who the fuck is this? Wolfman. Even from afar, I can smell your
[4287.64s -> 4295.74s]  futured stench. Be glad I don't have an appetite for carcasses, meat. The figure hides its face
[4295.74s -> 4303.05s]  under the hood. It smells of wet soil and fur. He's got like a machine gun. I know what you're
[4303.05s -> 4308.09s]  after. I can help you reclaim what you've lost. If you help me attend a certain matter, what do you
[4308.09s -> 4315.59s]  say, comrade? As he leans toward me, I can hear him giggling under the hood. I knew what would
[4315.59s -> 4321.51s]  interest you. Before we make a deal, we need to prove that you can do the job. I have no time for
[4321.51s -> 4327.72s]  weaklings meat. Do you follow? Show me what you're made of. Get through to the silent forest.
[4328.78s -> 4333.26s]  You think it's so easy. If I were you, I would prepare myself well before setting out.
[4334.46s -> 4339.83s]  When you get there, you will find me in this spot. Remember it. The wolf grabs you by the fucking
[4339.83s -> 4347.13s]  shirt and rips you towards his face. The likes of you always crawl back to me. The wolf grabs
[4347.13s -> 4357.61s]  some of that and scribbles something on it. Show item. Does he even trade? Oh, beautiful item.
[4357.61s -> 4365.59s]  Perfect for a church fair. So, you want it? Wolf road. What's that you got there? The wolf snatches
[4365.59s -> 4371.35s]  the photograph from my hand and studies it carefully. Finally, he snorts. His thick yellow spit landing
[4371.35s -> 4379.69s]  on the photo. Aha! This road doesn't exist anymore. Overgrown with trees like all the other ones.
[4379.69s -> 4386.98s]  Wolf throws the photo to the ground. Before, better forget about the road home meat. Around
[4386.98s -> 4396.58s]  here all the roads lead to nowhere. Trade. Oh, he's got a watch. How much money do I have?
[4396.58s -> 4405.46s]  Where's my money? How much money do I have? All right, I have three empty bottles. Is that enough
[4405.46s -> 4426.25s]  for a gun? Handgun frame. Reputation is money. Tape. Is that free? Value? No. Chain. I buy weapons
[4426.25s -> 4435.51s]  and ammo. All right. I need this. 150. I need a weapon. I need something. He has gasoline. 60.
[4435.51s -> 4451.91s]  I don't have enough. Here, take a bottle. I don't want that shit. Um, I need to buy gasoline.
[4452.95s -> 4461.11s]  Alcohol? Wait, I have other stuff. Wait, hold on. Tell me the story. I'd avoid getting in trouble
[4461.11s -> 4466.54s]  if I were you, Meat. Or at least until you get a decent weapon. If you wish to spend some more
[4466.54s -> 4470.78s]  quality time basking in the striking yet natural beauty of my features before you head off to the
[4470.78s -> 4479.11s]  silent forest, you will find me in my camp. And oh, he's leaving. I want to hold on. Before you
[4479.11s -> 4483.83s]  head off to the silent forest, you will find me in my camp in the dry meadow. Points to a location
[4483.83s -> 4488.39s]  on my map. He's not gone, right? All right. You're still here. All right. Give me a second. Just stay
[4488.39s -> 4494.26s]  there. Where's my wardrobe? All right. I got a bunch of, I got batteries. I got fucking pills.
[4495.06s -> 4501.88s]  I got bullets and shit. What did I just do? Okay. Where is it? Okay. I got metal. I got nails.
[4502.76s -> 4522.79s]  Let's sell the battery. I need that gasoline. I just don't know what this does. Don't sell the
[4522.79s -> 4528.94s]  nails. Okay. What about the bullet? 20. All right. That'll give me 50. That'll give me 60, 70 enough
[4528.94s -> 4536.81s]  for gasoline. That's one bullet. It's, I'm not gonna be able to do shit. That's fine. All right.
[4536.97s -> 4550.33s]  Give me that. And I want a gasoline, please. 50 minus 40. All right. Okay. The bullet is for you.
[4550.33s -> 4562.74s]  What do you mean? Sell the bullet. Buy gasoline. Thanks a lot. Appreciate the business. Now I'm
[4562.74s -> 4572.09s]  going to fill this shit up to all the way. I think. I don't know. Yeah. Should I? Halfway?
[4573.21s -> 4590.49s]  Should I do this halfway? Halfway? Get it to half. All right. That's it half. And then I've got other
[4590.49s -> 4596.74s]  stuff to put gas on. Dump gasoline on ground to make fire. That's not, that's not a bad idea.
[4596.74s -> 4608.28s]  Thanks for the tip. What else can I do? All right. Go over to this. Yeah. This thing over here.
[4611.22s -> 4617.14s]  Saw. Use. There's the gasoline over there. That's the EXP bubbles down there. I'm gonna fill this up
[4617.14s -> 4635.38s]  to. I was supposed to do that? I don't know. Was that, was that supposed to happen? I don't know if
[4635.38s -> 4646.12s]  I was supposed to. Convert wood logs to planks. Convert wood logs. Aren't there wood logs over here?
[4647.08s -> 4652.31s]  Wood logs. How do you not have wood logs in a pile of wood logs? It's empty, but it's wood logs.
[4652.31s -> 4658.46s]  There's wood logs there. Why would there not be wood logs on a pile of wood logs? What the fuck is
[4658.46s -> 4668.28s]  this game talking about? In the pile of wood logs, there are no wood logs. This should be at least
[4668.28s -> 4677.10s]  one. I gotta find wood logs. All right. I'm gonna find some wood logs. There's the wolf's camp.
[4677.10s -> 4684.04s]  Wolf's camp. Silent forest. There's like the portal. All right. I'm gonna go to find wood logs.
[4685.00s -> 4692.57s]  How do you get wood logs? Do I have to cut down trees? I don't have an axe. Are they just lying
[4692.57s -> 4707.75s]  around? They're locked. Good thing I got a lock pick. Get it open. Ooh. Full container of gasoline.
[4707.75s -> 4722.36s]  That hurt a dog. This is my only weapon. I have to save it. Wait, can I hit people with a bottle?
[4722.36s -> 4739.61s]  I think I can. But what about a broken glass? Broken glass. Um, what are these pills? Oh, I could.
[4739.85s -> 4742.41s]  All right. I can't get the... If I step on the glass, it's gonna hurt me.
[4743.13s -> 4758.06s]  This game seems pretty realistic. Wait, I need logs. Wait, I gotta go back. More gasoline. Okay,
[4758.06s -> 4774.92s]  so gasoline is gonna go into... I'm gonna get rid of it. Do you eat glass? I know. I'm gonna fill...
[4774.92s -> 4784.18s]  I'm gonna go just gasoline. I can like fill it up the whole way. All right. Let's do that.
[4784.98s -> 4791.03s]  Right? That's probably not a bad idea. Gasoline here. Let's get it filled. At least enough for
[4791.51s -> 4800.73s]  I'm comfortable with it. Because that guy... I'll have plenty of gas. I'm filling the whole thing
[4800.73s -> 4815.42s]  up. Full tank. Full. Is it nighttime? What have I fucking done all day? What time is it? What time
[4815.42s -> 4845.26s]  is it? Workshop. Oh, this is a huge inventory. Okay, just put everything in here. Um, chain trap.
[4848.14s -> 4859.27s]  No, I don't... Repair item. No. Okay, I need to put the syringe thing in here. Odd looking mushroom.
[4859.27s -> 4867.98s]  20 essence. 30, 40, 50. I got it. It's done. What the hell is this? Staying in dark areas at night
[4867.98s -> 4873.35s]  can be dangerous to me. Okay, all right. I can see far... This is a level up system. This is how you
[4873.35s -> 4880.33s]  level up. Okay, I can see further. Once a day I'll be able to heal myself by standing next to an
[4880.33s -> 4887.59s]  electric light source. Once a day I'll be able to learn my current location on the map. That's pretty...
[4888.23s -> 4897.82s]  That's... I'll be able to heal myself by eating mushrooms. Any electric light source could be
[4897.82s -> 4910.46s]  anything. I kind of like the first one. So I could just stay next to anything. Seeing further is
[4911.10s -> 4919.59s]  important. I don't know. Either one of these two sounds really, really good. I would... If it was
[4919.59s -> 4924.79s]  me, and because I'm stupid, I would pick this one if I was playing off stream. Because I don't have
[4924.79s -> 4930.94s]  a fucking chat of 15,000 people to help me. So I don't even need this. Like, we can pretend
[4930.94s -> 4946.39s]  that I already clicked this because I have you guys. So I'm gonna just go where it takes me.
[4946.95s -> 4956.38s]  It's done. I need to choose a negative perk. What do you mean a negative perk? What the fuck you...
[4956.38s -> 4964.20s]  What do you mean a negative perk? I have to pick this one. What? Staying in dark areas at night
[4964.20s -> 4983.18s]  can be dangerous to me. I like being able to see... But I could heal. It's over. I did it.
[4984.26s -> 4996.23s]  See further. What's that mean? Does it mean like physically actually seeing over here or like the
[4996.23s -> 5002.68s]  light goes further? Oh, that's not good. That's actually kind of bad. That's not good at all. This
[5002.68s -> 5007.08s]  is terrible. What's the point of this? It's useless. Shouldn't have got it. I should have got the moth.
[5007.72s -> 5014.86s]  Too late. Got to sleep in your bed that you make. All right. What time is it? I don't know. Let's
[5014.86s -> 5020.28s]  go with... I got some bread. I got some bandages. I got... Okay, let's go scavenge. This game's fun.
[5020.28s -> 5032.71s]  I like this game. All right. Time to scavenge. What time is it? I don't know. He's coping.
[5033.93s -> 5037.13s]  Actually, that's not bad because I can see pretty damn far. All right. Scavenge.
[5044.22s -> 5056.52s]  Is it nighttime? Dogs over here. All right. Easy. Burned house. Burned house. All right. I can
[5056.52s -> 5064.68s]  scavenge in this burned house. I don't know. Those dogs are in there. Dogs are there, but they can't
[5064.68s -> 5088.66s]  get in the house. They don't have hands. What? It's an open door. Oh, fuck. How many fucking dogs are
[5088.66s -> 5102.76s]  there? Oh, there's a tractor over here. There's a log. All right. Hold on. Oh, gasoline and a tire.
[5102.76s -> 5118.23s]  Nice. Dogs. Don't touch dog. Just... That's not a light, right? Logs? There's debris over there.
[5118.23s -> 5156.98s]  There's like a big wooden log over there. There's a pig too. There's nobody here. I'm fine.
[5156.98s -> 5179.45s]  Okay. I got a log. Oh, what does he got? An ear? I don't know. Get the... Don't do that.
[5186.10s -> 5195.40s]  Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. I got it. I'm out of here. I got to leave. I'm out.
[5195.40s -> 5203.06s]  Time to go. I got a log. Okay. I got a log. Where am I? Burned house. Okay. I got to make... I got
[5203.06s -> 5208.31s]  to get like a weapon. What happened to me? What was that? What happened? Why am I sick? Why am
[5208.31s -> 5215.24s]  my character sick? Why is my character sick? Why is he sick? What happened? What's his ween?
[5215.24s -> 5225.83s]  You're poisoned. How do I get rid of poison? Bandage? All right. I'm back home. I got to turn
[5225.83s -> 5240.36s]  the lights on. Okay. I've got... Is it time for the lights? No, not yet. What do I got? I got a couple
[5240.36s -> 5258.15s]  of planks. All right. Workbench. Board with nails. Got it. I got a weapon now. Okay. What does the
[5258.15s -> 5264.22s]  ear do? Throwable can be used as bait for carnivores. Okay. I stole some gasoline. I'm
[5264.22s -> 5270.33s]  going to put it into the tank. Bottle. Let's store the tire because I don't know what the hell this
[5270.33s -> 5279.29s]  is for. I'm going to... I'm going to put on the board, I think. I guess. Yeah. Good. Oh, now I
[5279.29s -> 5286.50s]  feel like I'm ready. I need more bandages. Bandage with alcohol. Yeah. Fuck it. Let's do it.
[5287.14s -> 5294.60s]  Fuck it. Let's get it. I'm going to eat this food. Does that do anything? Was that a stupid
[5294.68s -> 5310.46s]  mistake? This is not like Minecraft. No, this doesn't heal you. Okay. That was dumb. I just
[5310.46s -> 5316.12s]  have more stamina. Well, oh well. All right. Hotbar upgrade. I need to board up some...
[5316.12s -> 5319.00s]  I only have two boards. All right. I got a weapon. I'm fine. I'm just going to stand next to the...
[5321.35s -> 5325.03s]  Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. I have to turn the light on. Turn on the lights now, please.
[5325.03s -> 5330.31s]  Right? Turn on the light. Turn the light on. Turn on the light. That's like... There's something
[5330.31s -> 5340.36s]  happening. Oh, it's rain. It's raining. All right. It's raining. What does that mean?
[5343.83s -> 5350.31s]  I didn't mean to swing that. I thought it was like something zoning in. Like the sides of your
[5350.31s -> 5357.03s]  screen are flickering. It is an animal or a bad... Like a monster or something. I'm just going to
[5357.03s -> 5366.94s]  stand here until it's... Is that lightning or is that... Okay. That's lightning. I can't get
[5366.94s -> 5378.89s]  struck by lightning, right? There's a roof here. You're doing a great overreacting to everything
[5378.89s -> 5403.90s]  joke. I drank three coffees today. I can't help it. This is four. Should I just stay in here?
[5404.30s -> 5412.10s]  I need to use my daytime. But what's the... What's the actual... You know what else it is, too?
[5412.10s -> 5419.05s]  I have to talk louder because I'm blocking both my ears. So I'm... It's like somebody has a vacuum
[5419.05s -> 5434.84s]  cleaner on right now. Thank you. Nice work. You guys nailed it. No, for those of you that are new,
[5434.84s -> 5446.17s]  if I block both my ears, I've like literally become useless. You know how like Superman has
[5446.17s -> 5451.75s]  kryptonite and he's like the most powerful entity on earth, right? But if you like hold a kryptonite
[5452.30s -> 5459.21s]  crystal up to him, he just like... That's what happens to me. Like I could be like the fucking
[5459.21s -> 5463.96s]  strongest person on earth. If you just covered both my ears, I'd be like... I'd be useless.
[5470.23s -> 5482.82s]  You're not Superman. Ego maniac. That's my weakness. You're like a shark. What?
[5486.12s -> 5491.82s]  All right. Is it nighttime? But the question I was going to ask is how do you tell when...
[5492.70s -> 5500.23s]  How much time is it for a day cycle in the game? An hour? 30 minutes? 20 minutes? What's... How do
[5500.23s -> 5511.86s]  I know? You can tell from your light, okay? You find the watch. I could have bought a watch.
[5517.70s -> 5523.14s]  When the light gets orange, that's when it's getting dark. Thank you so much for your incredible
[5523.14s -> 5534.39s]  contribution. When grass is green as day, grass orange dusk. No color is night, okay? Sorry,
[5534.39s -> 5539.80s]  I'm still good to go. I knew it was going to happen too. And now this is where it gets fucking
[5539.80s -> 5574.12s]  loud. And I've got the kryptonite on too. Is there a mushroom down here? Apparently there's
[5574.12s -> 5594.78s]  a mushroom down here somewhere. Orange, orange, orange. Time to go. I forget where the house is.
[5596.71s -> 5617.30s]  Oh no. Where's the house? I'm going to be honest. I'm too afraid to do anything.
[5618.84s -> 5625.77s]  I'm too afraid to fucking do anything. I'm just going to wait till it's orange. I thought that
[5625.77s -> 5634.30s]  around here. I thought it was orange. Barricade. I don't have any planks.
[5634.94s -> 5645.37s]  It's a very quick cue. You have right to be antsy. Get wood to barricade.
[5646.81s -> 5654.07s]  There's a storm outside. That's not smart. But where do you get wood?
[5655.03s -> 5665.77s]  It's not just from the simply like the trees, right? You just have to find it. This adult is
[5665.77s -> 5672.17s]  scared of thunder. No, this adult is scared of loud ass noises that go in both ears at the same
[5672.17s -> 5677.54s]  time while he's doing kryptonite to himself. Guys, I don't even listen to music in the car.
[5682.62s -> 5689.27s]  I need my ears to see. Somebody, there's a scientific reason for it. I don't know what
[5689.27s -> 5698.97s]  it's called. I swear to God, this is not a joke. I need my ears to be aware of where I am and shit.
[5698.97s -> 5714.90s]  I swear to God. What is it called? Ecto, echolocation. I really think I have that.
[5715.70s -> 5720.98s]  Because when my ears are blocked, it's hard for me to pay attention and see and stuff.
[5720.98s -> 5726.90s]  I think I use echolocation like a bat. It's weird because when I scream really loud,
[5727.46s -> 5739.62s]  I can see better. It's weird. It's dark out now. All right, I gotta turn it on, right? I'm done.
[5739.62s -> 5748.41s]  I don't fucking know, guys. Orange means almost night, right? I'm just trying to learn. Orange
[5748.41s -> 5755.80s]  means it's almost nighttime. So when it's orange, that's when it's like get the fuck inside.
[5755.96s -> 5761.64s]  Get inside now, please. And then once this, this is a, it's like a green light, yellow light,
[5761.64s -> 5772.17s]  and then red light. Now I know. Just needed to learn. You wasted an entire day. Congrats.
[5773.05s -> 5779.53s]  Every single day it gets harder. You might need to restart. Wait, what do you mean every,
[5779.53s -> 5784.01s]  every day it gets harder? Did I just really waste a whole, what did I do today? I don't know.
[5784.01s -> 5791.80s]  Whatever. Does it really just get harder every day? I'm just waiting to turn on the generator.
[5792.28s -> 5805.21s]  What was that sound? Is what I want to know. Don't let the chat backseat you. That's okay,
[5805.21s -> 5809.13s]  though, because I have no idea what I'm doing. And this is a game that doesn't hold your hand.
[5812.68s -> 5821.46s]  I'm just trying to see just, okay, so this is how long it takes. All right, turn on the generator.
[5822.26s -> 5827.85s]  Not yet. Turn it on. Not yet, but it's still orange. Actually, it's becoming not orange.
[5828.89s -> 5834.33s]  Okay, I'm gonna turn it on now. Okay, now I'll turn it on because it's becoming faded.
[5835.29s -> 5853.42s]  Where's the light? Was that light? Okay, just stand next to this all day. What a waste of time.
[5854.06s -> 5867.83s]  So if I just lock myself in the corner with the light facing out, I'm safe. Close the doors. The
[5867.83s -> 5881.14s]  doors are closed. Close the doors. I don't know where they are. Which door is open? I'm terrified
[5881.14s -> 5902.07s]  to go over here. Oven. Is that a person? I'm closing that. Just stand over here. This should
[5902.07s -> 5927.26s]  be fine. This is how you die. This is not fine. How do you escape now? I'm not trying to escape
[5927.26s -> 5936.95s]  right now. I'm trying to... Guys, I didn't even have a weapon until 15 minutes ago. I was being
[5936.95s -> 5959.00s]  attacked by dogs and shit. Turn off the lamp. You won't ever tell me I won't do something.
[5967.64s -> 5983.30s]  Five seconds. One, two, three, four, five. Turn off the lamp in 10 seconds.
[5984.18s -> 6001.78s]  No. Something's coming. No. Something's over here. Don't move. Is there a crouch? There's something
[6001.78s -> 6016.78s]  out here. Walking around. What does that mean? Does that mean they're near here? Oh god. This is
[6016.78s -> 6037.40s]  not good. Something is lurking in the shadow. I should stay close to the light. I'm... I'm standing
[6037.40s -> 6041.67s]  right next to the light. Oh, they're in the house now. They're in the house. The ghosts are in the
[6041.67s -> 6067.37s]  house. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Why is it not? What happened? Why did that happen? What is that?
[6089.08s -> 6100.06s]  What happened? A man roughly my size is standing before me. I can barely make out his disturbingly
[6100.06s -> 6105.42s]  familiar features through the mat visor of his helmet. The massive helmet is covered with an
[6105.42s -> 6113.83s]  old sack and seems to be an integral part of the unnaturally pale body. I remember him. He's the
[6113.83s -> 6120.60s]  one who rescued me from the doctor's house. The man reaches out to me with his black hand.
[6121.48s -> 6126.92s]  It's covered in charcoal. There's something written on his worn woolen glove. We need to stick
[6126.92s -> 6132.78s]  together, brother. His lips are moving, but all the sounds are drowned inside the helmet.
[6132.78s -> 6137.10s]  He shrugs and takes the huge sack off his back and drops it on the ground, revealing its contents.
[6137.66s -> 6144.33s]  Go to the road. He wipes his left glove on his pants, takes out the charcoal from his pocket,
[6144.33s -> 6149.61s]  and starts scribbling. When he finishes, he lifts his dirty hand. All roads lead deeper into the
[6149.61s -> 6176.86s]  woods. He's got a lot of boards. What are you guys linking? What is this? He stole the gun.
[6181.85s -> 6191.90s]  It looks... I mean, it looks like... No, guys, this is... I'm telling you. Let me tell you something.
[6193.88s -> 6200.92s]  I'll show you. This is the kind of internal reaction you have when you realize
[6201.80s -> 6209.05s]  that the movie you're watching with your parents, you get to the scene that has the
[6209.05s -> 6224.44s]  pornography in it. This is what you're thinking internally, and my face game is what you're
[6224.44s -> 6227.64s]  actually presenting to everybody in the family that's sitting there watching.
[6241.64s -> 6249.00s]  That looks fucking like 100 years old. I gotta stop moving my skin, because
[6249.00s -> 6256.06s]  when I sit here like this, I could be 20. Anytime I make any emotion, I turn 40.
[6256.54s -> 6275.08s]  Thanks for that, by the way. All right, let me keep going. So this is me. I just died, right? So
[6275.08s -> 6281.75s]  this is me with the... I got, like, oven mitts on or something. I got a bolt handle. Hold still so
[6281.75s -> 6289.06s]  they don't see your age. Yeah, it's a weird superpower. Then when I stand still, I de-age
[6289.06s -> 6295.56s]  by like 10 years. I could be 20. What an eagle maniac. I'm fine. All right, I still have...
[6295.56s -> 6301.37s]  What happens here? So I have no money. I guess... Whatever. I can't do anything.
[6302.17s -> 6305.85s]  All right, now I'm gonna prepare completely, because now I understand the game. I still have
[6305.85s -> 6311.37s]  my board. Gonna get boards. What's in here? I've got gasoline. How much gasoline do I have?
[6312.49s -> 6320.22s]  I gotta go find boards. I got a plank. I can hit stuff. I'm ready. How much gas do I have? Plenty.
[6321.18s -> 6328.42s]  Just totally plenty. All right, let's go. The lighting's weird in your room. If you fix it,
[6328.42s -> 6339.00s]  you might look younger. I gotta turn off the generator. All right, it's daytime. We're good.
[6339.00s -> 6343.64s]  Now I understand how the day and night cycle works. I'm gonna bring a little bit of food. I'm
[6343.64s -> 6348.84s]  gonna bring just some bandages. I'm gonna go scavenging to get boards to put all over the
[6348.84s -> 6357.40s]  place. All right, store this shit. I can... I'm gonna take this. I'm gonna bring out...
[6360.17s -> 6366.95s]  Fuck, I don't know. Heal? Is this a pill? I'm always afraid to make mistakes in these games.
[6367.83s -> 6378.92s]  I need a bandage. I need two rags. Prioritize the bedroom. I will try. All right, I'm just gonna...
[6378.92s -> 6384.02s]  I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. I'm going for it. Let's go. I have to just get stuff. Prioritize the...
[6384.02s -> 6388.58s]  What's the bedroom? All these rooms are all fucked up. Which one is the bedroom? I have no idea.
[6388.58s -> 6399.05s]  That one? Okay, let's go. The one with the bed. Okay, I'm going for it. Let's go. I got a plank.
[6399.05s -> 6404.39s]  I've got... I'm ready to defend myself. What do we got? I'm gonna check out this burned house.
[6412.98s -> 6421.13s]  There we go. All right. Broken glass. Let's get it. I don't... Maybe I can use it for something.
[6421.69s -> 6426.14s]  It's a trap. All right, nice. Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. Let's go.
[6427.10s -> 6433.99s]  Got plenty of daylight. Burned house. I got my plank. I can hit the random things that attack me.
[6435.77s -> 6449.10s]  All right, like that. Like right now. I'm ready. Two dogs. Four dogs. Is that too many?
[6449.18s -> 6462.71s]  There might be six. There's a six dog. There's a camp over here. I have to do this. Uh-oh. What
[6462.71s -> 6471.29s]  the fuck was that? It's the... I didn't... Okay, that's what it looks like. God damn it. I didn't...
[6471.29s -> 6484.25s]  I couldn't even fucking tell. I need to check in here. Can they see me?
[6487.29s -> 6493.66s]  Oh no, I'm gonna die again. There's like seven of them. Get out of here. Wait.
[6493.66s -> 6500.14s]  Wait. No, no, no. Give me the meat, meat, meat, meat, meat. Hurry up. Get in your fucking
[6500.14s -> 6509.54s]  inventory. Hurry up. Ah! How do I throw it down? How do I give them the meat? How do I give them
[6509.54s -> 6525.32s]  the meat? Okay, no. I have the meat. That's why they're coming over here. Oh my God. It's not
[6525.32s -> 6532.31s]  gonna work out. Throw the meat. I was trying to. Does it hold right? How do you throw this shit on
[6532.31s -> 6548.22s]  the ground? What the hell am I doing? You have to hold it for like two or three seconds.
[6548.86s -> 6558.86s]  To put it in your fucking hand, you have to go... All right, I don't know what the hell I'm
[6558.86s -> 6566.49s]  supposed to be doing here. Trying to find wood, but apparently this is the dogpocalypse.
[6567.51s -> 6573.56s]  It's all dogs. It's only dogs. The animals took over.
[6573.88s -> 6584.50s]  I gotta go a different way. Don't step on these poisonous mushrooms.
[6593.90s -> 6612.18s]  No weapon. I got a weapon. I need to heal though. I need logs. You would think that logs would be
[6612.18s -> 6619.13s]  the easiest thing in the whole game to find. There's trees everywhere. Why is it like finding
[6619.13s -> 6652.04s]  ammo in Resident Evil? How come I've not seen any logs? Can I get a log? Okay, there's a tree.
[6652.92s -> 6682.58s]  A fallen tree. Its bark looks chewed up. Hit it. That's not doing anything. Okay, I'm gonna...
[6685.34s -> 6698.57s]  That's not a log. This is like a chest. There's treasure chests lying around, but no logs. Did I
[6698.57s -> 6727.56s]  get like a shitty seed? There's more bear traps than logs. Oh my God, finally. Wooden logs.
[6728.20s -> 6757.88s]  That's it? Thank God, finally. Stumps. Stone too. All right, so I got... Getting there.
[6758.52s -> 6771.05s]  Okay, how many logs do I need to make enough planks to survive? I have six. Did I miss a pile?
[6771.61s -> 6791.11s]  There we go. All right, I'm fucking off. I'm out of here. I'm over here at the log pile.
[6791.67s -> 6805.80s]  Over at the hideout. Let's go. Trap. I missed... What do you mean the biggest pile? I missed a pile?
[6806.36s -> 6818.34s]  How did I do that? This one right here? That's not... Oh, I thought... I didn't think this was...
[6818.34s -> 6833.05s]  I thought they had to be the little like rabbit pellets. Okay, I'm good. Wait, chest. I need to...
[6833.05s -> 6845.69s]  Okay, let's get me out of here. There's a lot of these random crates. So now I board up with the
[6845.69s -> 6858.87s]  windows and then make sure that I have light in the bedroom. More piles. Thank God. This is just a
[6858.87s -> 6875.74s]  wood. This is just... We're getting as much wood as I can carry. I got no more room. I gotta go.
[6875.74s -> 6882.98s]  What is this? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I hear a dog somewhere. I know. I gotta
[6882.98s -> 6886.74s]  kill it. I gotta kill this dog. I'm gonna kill the dog. There's only one dog, right? Kill it.
[6889.94s -> 6895.22s]  There's only one dog. Kill it, I guess. Don't... I had one here. I fucking missed.
[6895.94s -> 6914.25s]  All right, I'll give it here. Give me the dog's ear. What happened to it? I had to do that. There's
[6914.25s -> 6926.62s]  nothing else I could do. Where the hell am I? I don't... I think I'm going the wrong way. Okay,
[6926.62s -> 6944.23s]  up, up, up from here. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Not right now. All right, we're here.
[6950.62s -> 6962.89s]  All right, so now get in here. Thank God. I have nothing to cook, right? No mushrooms. Turn the logs
[6963.85s -> 6985.45s]  into planks. So, wood logs to planks. 25 fuel. How many should I do? Is that a good idea? All of
[6985.45s -> 7013.82s]  them. I... Okay, I have 16 planks. Okay, now windows first, right? Which windows? Bedroom windows
[7014.22s -> 7040.65s]  first. Window. Bingo. Barricade. I need... Let's go. This one, too. And then this one.
[7045.77s -> 7053.00s]  Good. What's that? All right, let's just throw up in my mouth. I don't know why I told you that.
[7053.64s -> 7074.26s]  Should I very... No. Corner of the bedroom. I don't know, there's a backpack back here.
[7074.98s -> 7083.10s]  Can you honk in this game? That'd be awesome if you could. Okay, so this is fine.
[7083.98s -> 7104.58s]  Now I need to do that. What about over here? Is this okay? Is that blocking that? Push the furniture
[7104.58s -> 7110.76s]  in front of the door. All right, barricaded window. That's barricaded. So, this has to stay here,
[7110.76s -> 7120.62s]  though, because look, I mean, is that blocking this? Can I get confirmed? Am I now safe? Okay,
[7121.50s -> 7131.62s]  so they can't get in now. Door. Close the doors. Lock up. The only way you can get in is from here,
[7131.62s -> 7140.14s]  but should I... I'm just gonna barricade this door. Put the stool in front of the door. Yeah,
[7140.14s -> 7153.21s]  so that's blocking that door. I don't think I have any more furniture. Can I make furniture?
[7154.01s -> 7181.18s]  Okay. Drop your traps. Do I have traps on me? Oh, okay. Trap. Broken glass. Where should I put it?
[7181.82s -> 7186.44s]  In front of... In front of a window? In front of one of the doors?
[7189.38s -> 7193.75s]  Should I put it, like, over here? Right in front of the front door.
[7194.07s -> 7230.39s]  What? Outside the front door. It's, like, here. Like... Wait, am I gonna step on this? Oh, shit,
[7230.39s -> 7252.23s]  the well. I need... Oh, shit. Um, I need gasoline. Where's my gas? Give me my gas. I can remake this.
[7258.38s -> 7276.23s]  Okay, give me the gas on this hot bar here. Make some more wood. Here we go. Okay. What does the
[7278.78s -> 7291.99s]  well do for me? Give me fresh water? Okay, so... Oh, nice. Okay, so I can heal.
[7292.79s -> 7305.14s]  Is this infinite? Okay, I can hold... I can keep these in here. Now let's put the glass down
[7306.10s -> 7313.13s]  once per day. That's useful. Okay, so, um, I'm gonna close it. Put it here and then close the door.
[7319.64s -> 7329.48s]  No, they can't get in. It's orange. All right. Did I do it... Did I do this right?
[7329.48s -> 7333.32s]  Oh, wait, wait. I have to... I have to turn the, uh... I have to turn the generator on right now.
[7333.32s -> 7340.71s]  I didn't turn the generator on. Where's the light? Where's the lamp? Does it... Okay,
[7340.71s -> 7359.27s]  this is... Turn it on. Okay, there's plenty of gas. We're fine. Did you just write GTA 2 is lame?
[7359.91s -> 7371.82s]  What does that have to do with anything? Okay, this is blocked. I think I'm safe now. I'm safe,
[7371.82s -> 7382.49s]  I think. I should be. I gotta take my plank out just in case somebody gets in here.
[7385.05s -> 7394.95s]  And the torch. All right, I'm ready for a fight. Bring the other light in. What do you mean the
[7394.95s -> 7416.04s]  other light? There's another light? Put two lamps in the bedroom. Um, okay, here we go. It's
[7416.04s -> 7429.11s]  happening. It's happening right now. So I gotta put all the lights in the bedroom. So I'm going.
[7429.11s -> 7433.78s]  I'm going. I'm going. I'm moving. I'm moving. I'm moving. All right, everything's barricaded. I've
[7433.78s -> 7438.42s]  got two lamps. I've got the generator running and I have my... I've got traps outside the front door.
[7438.42s -> 7457.27s]  I've got everything boarded up. One guy. You don't have a roof. There's no roofs in this game.
[7458.15s -> 7470.82s]  Close the door. All right, they can't get in any other way, right? Let's board it up.
[7471.22s -> 7478.73s]  It's all boarded up. All right, I'm ready. Barricade the door now.
[7480.14s -> 7504.62s]  Yeah. Should I not have that? I'm just locking myself in the bedroom completely. Now I'm trapped.
[7504.62s -> 7519.64s]  Put the lamp on the door. It's... I can dismantle it. It's okay. All right. Um, should be fine.
[7525.00s -> 7532.07s]  What? Now what do I have to do? I still need to go over to like the secret silent forest.
[7532.79s -> 7548.17s]  Okay, I can do it. Don't stand near the windows. I can hear something skittering around.
[7574.33s -> 7596.50s]  What if I don't don't stand at the door either? I'm good. I'm good. They can't get over here.
[7596.50s -> 7609.98s]  They don't even know I'm in here. It's all barricaded up. Well, what's that thing? Why is
[7609.98s -> 7615.59s]  there a demon in here? Why is there a demon in here? What do I do? What do I do about that? What
[7615.59s -> 7651.80s]  do I do? Touch it? I picked it up. What does it do? Eat it. Um, okay. I ate it. I gave it a heal,
[7651.80s -> 7658.49s]  apparently. Why somebody just said eat it and I just reflect it. I just don't know what to look
[7658.49s -> 7692.65s]  at in the chat. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Here come the ghosts. Are they going to turn
[7692.65s -> 7698.66s]  off both lamps? I got to move the lamp. I have to move the lamp out of the room. Yep. They turned
[7698.66s -> 7707.03s]  up that lamp. It's okay. They can't get in here though, right? Ghosts can move through walls.
[7710.79s -> 7716.15s]  Ghosts can move through walls. How do I combat a ghost moving through a fucking wall? How do I?
[7716.95s -> 7736.42s]  I'm good. They can't move through the walls. Things you can't kill are afraid of the light
[7736.42s -> 7757.69s]  usually. I made it. Correct. Turn both lamps off. Okay. I almost just died from this.
[7769.99s -> 7778.63s]  Day four? I thought it was day two. I thought it was day two. Is it day four? When did it become
[7778.63s -> 7798.34s]  day four? Let's turn the generator off. I have to get out of the room. Um, where's my bed? It's
[7798.34s -> 7803.61s]  right here. All right. I got some time here. Uh, trader is back. I got a hundred trader reputation
[7803.61s -> 7811.02s]  gold. I noticed a smile on his face through the mat visor of his helmet. The man nods in greeting.
[7811.66s -> 7823.29s]  Show item. Okay. Trade. Wish I had whatever the hell that demon dropped. That'd be nice.
[7828.06s -> 7845.51s]  Axe blade. I don't have any money. I got, I stopped biting your lip. That's bad habit. Um,
[7846.39s -> 7865.59s]  I could get gas. Save it for the watch. Yeah, that is useful. Shotgun. I feel like the,
[7866.31s -> 7869.35s]  maybe later on when you survive one night, so you get more money or something, but
[7870.41s -> 7877.99s]  I can barely walk around with a stick with nails on it. Get some wires. I think I have some wires,
[7877.99s -> 7890.54s]  don't I? I gotta move this though so I can turn off the generator. Better off finding stuff. Yeah,
[7891.10s -> 7905.77s]  I got plenty of gas. All right. Move this back. Maybe too far. You're right here.
[7905.77s -> 7923.02s]  All right. Up and work bench board with nails torch. I still have a little bit of torch left.
[7923.82s -> 7935.38s]  All right. What the hell? Just dump all this in here. Okay. Lock pick. I do need the wire.
[7935.38s -> 7940.66s]  No, that's no, that's a different kind of like curly squiggly thing. That's rope and that's
[7940.66s -> 7953.61s]  wire. I need to wire the nails in there too. Upgrade the work bench. Oh shit. I'll be able
[7953.61s -> 7957.05s]  to craft more items and fit more upgrades into weapons when I upgrade my work bench.
[7958.01s -> 7985.35s]  Oh, let's do it. Okay. Ooh, I need a barrel. Lantern. How long does it last?
[7991.29s -> 8001.56s]  Waiting to see the final time on the speed run. Probably 16 hours and 42 minutes.
[8004.63s -> 8012.63s]  Should I just buy these? I think I'm going to buy two of them, but I need,
[8013.59s -> 8023.62s]  I'll go look for them. I mean, I'm going to, I've got, I'm going to go explore.
[8024.50s -> 8033.90s]  I'm going to bring some meat with me. I think I have a couple of pieces, right? Yeah.
[8034.86s -> 8040.94s]  Bring this. I have a bandage. I have, I don't think I can think of pills too, don't I?
[8043.08s -> 8055.46s]  Rag and alcohol. Can I make, how do I make a rag to go off? Right. I'm just going to go.
[8057.30s -> 8065.22s]  I'm going to go, I need to go like down here. Or no, I, the underground, it's been like two
[8065.22s -> 8068.66s]  and a half hours. I was supposed to go this way. Underground entrance. What am I, I have to go in
[8068.66s -> 8087.56s]  the underground entrance. I forgot that was part of the, all right, let's go. All right. Here we go.
[8087.56s -> 8094.58s]  Underground entrance. This loud rain. I, sorry, I can't hear you. Already there's a dog.
[8095.06s -> 8105.75s]  I want nothing to do with this dog. I could buy a shotgun. I can only shoot it one time, which I
[8105.75s -> 8122.47s]  will miss. I won't hit the thing I'm aiming at and it'll be a waste of money. There's that hole.
[8123.19s -> 8145.40s]  It's in here. Wait, how do I get in here? Climb the window, right? Get in the underground lair.
[8146.36s -> 8164.50s]  I hear mushroom noises. Here we go. I actually do not remember what I was supposed to do down
[8164.50s -> 8174.81s]  here, but I'm just going to go down here. I guess this is go through the underground passage. This
[8174.81s -> 8179.61s]  is the blood more. This is the fine, the den of evil of this game. And I've just barely doing it
[8179.61s -> 8197.08s]  now. Motorcycle magazine, automotive magazine. Okay. Maybe I can sell it. I needed another torch.
[8197.88s -> 8208.90s]  It's all right. There's no map down here either. What was that? Is it a dog? Of course it is.
[8208.90s -> 8250.81s]  Dogs everywhere. What is that? There's like a light over here. Mushroom. This part of the
[8250.81s -> 8267.80s]  passage is blocked by overgrown roots. Smash it. There's going to be like a sacrificial
[8267.80s -> 8280.01s]  fucking circle over here. It's my only way out. I won't be able to open it without my key.
[8280.01s -> 8285.75s]  Look at the handle. Press your ear against the keyhole. The hatch handle is covered in a thick
[8285.75s -> 8293.03s]  layer of dust. It hasn't been open for at least two weeks. I can hear a faint voice throughout
[8293.03s -> 8296.39s]  the howling wind. It sounds familiar. It seems to be coming through the keyhole. Someone's calling
[8296.39s -> 8303.43s]  me. The hatch handle is covered in a thick layer of dust. It hasn't been open for at least two
[8303.43s -> 8329.91s]  weeks. Look through the keyhole. I don't have a key. Is this the way I leave the game? This
[8329.91s -> 8337.02s]  is how you actually win. Interesting. Okay. Well, I'm on my way back, which means that I'm going to
[8337.98s -> 8343.13s]  I knew it. I knew it. I'm just going to run. I think I'm going to run. I think I'm just going to run.
[8344.71s -> 8349.35s]  Ah, I was down and then left. There's going to be a monster here or something. I don't know. I only
[8349.35s -> 8374.22s]  have a little bit more of my torch. Oh god. They are so powerful. Run. Just run, run, run, run, run,
[8374.22s -> 8399.24s]  run, run, run. Jesus. Oh, it's getting dark. It's getting dark outside. It's night. It's
[8399.24s -> 8418.98s]  nighttime now. I think it's nighttime right now. Is it nighttime right now? Oh, I do have mushrooms
[8418.98s -> 8454.89s]  to deposit. Oh god. What is this little dog? All right. I'm good. I'm good. A minute, a minute. Nice.
[8455.85s -> 8469.05s]  Okay. Let's put these mushrooms in. I don't even know what I need. Let's see. 10 essence, 10, 10.
[8469.05s -> 8480.68s]  Okay. Not bad. So I can't actually go down there yet, but I can make another board with nails.
[8480.68s -> 8491.83s]  What a repair item is what? It's four. Okay. It's one and five. To make a new one, it's two and ten.
[8491.83s -> 8495.82s]  So you just want to keep this repaired. I don't think I need to do that yet though.
[8503.16s -> 8509.24s]  Okay. I've got a battery, some more planks, some meat in there. All right. Looks good.
[8510.04s -> 8515.83s]  I just want to let you know that you're doing great. Hey, thanks. Appreciate that.
[8519.67s -> 8532.57s]  Can I make another lamp? This is a, somebody said this is a useless emote, the new one. I know.
[8533.45s -> 8536.17s]  I think the only reason why that's serious is because I didn't want to do a 24-hour stream.
[8536.17s -> 8540.33s]  It's last night I said, last night, sorry, what I meant to say was three days ago.
[8541.21s -> 8544.81s]  I said if I didn't have that here by the next stream, then I would have to do a 24-hour stream.
[8544.81s -> 8553.00s]  So I only did it so I didn't have to do that. All right. Now what? I think now I just have to
[8553.00s -> 8574.60s]  chill. The generator is not on. It's not dying time at all. You have time? Okay. Yeah. It's just
[8574.60s -> 8579.75s]  the rain. All right. I'm going to go down to the lower right just for a little bit and see if I
[8579.75s -> 8611.94s]  can grab any new supplies. Find a new place. What's this? A farm? Farmland? A wedding?
[8616.44s -> 8627.59s]  Wedding. It's just like a maze. Don't fucking be an idiot here.
[8638.22s -> 8657.38s]  What is over here? Oh shit, there's a place. Okay. Oh fuck.
[8659.70s -> 8664.44s]  Is it just one dog? Oh, it's a dog. Okay. That dog can't hurt me.
[8666.52s -> 8677.99s]  There's going to be gas in here, right? No gas or anything on the car? Nothing here? No way.
[8684.73s -> 8694.22s]  I have to do this quick. I have...
[8697.99s -> 8701.11s]  I had... I had to. I'm sorry. I had to do that. Otherwise it would kill me.
[8704.15s -> 8724.60s]  What's on the table? What is that? Nothing? What is going on in here? The torch... an old wagon
[8725.24s -> 8731.50s]  decorated with coked ribs and flowers made of white tissue paper. All right. I gotta go.
[8735.30s -> 8741.02s]  Chair. No. Come on. Like a box or something in here. Anything.
[8744.58s -> 8756.22s]  Food. Anything. A box. Stop. What do you mean stop? Stop, stop, stop, stop. I have to leave.
[8756.22s -> 8760.63s]  I have to leave. I have to get out of here now. Oh my god. Oh my god. What's happening?
[8760.63s -> 8767.11s]  What the fuck is that? It's orange, right? I gotta go. I'll come back here another time.
[8767.83s -> 8791.05s]  It's not orange yet. I wish I had a torch. Something's banging. Combo to get in there.
[8791.85s -> 8826.36s]  What is with this placement of barrels? I'm gonna get stuck in here and it's gonna be really bad.
[8830.15s -> 8833.91s]  Yeah. I'm like getting stuck in here. I can't get stuck in this shit right now.
[8834.87s -> 8841.38s]  I'm stuck in here now. Fantastic. I don't even know how I got in here.
[8841.94s -> 8854.06s]  Destroyed well. Good. I got one piece of rope. Awesome. Excellent. I'm surprised there's nothing
[8854.06s -> 8878.71s]  else in here. I can't. There's no... I need a combination to get over there.
[8879.11s -> 8892.94s]  I need a combination to get over here or in light. What the fuck was that? I just can't see
[8892.94s -> 8910.89s]  anything. Can you tell me there's nothing in the dog house? Wait. No. More of these random logs
[8910.89s -> 8923.02s]  in the way. Is there a faster way to get out of this? Put me down here. I'm just gonna go up
[8923.02s -> 8940.28s]  to the right. No. Do I actually... I have to go through this again. How do I get out? I do not
[8940.76s -> 8963.18s]  I do not remember how I got in here. I think it was from up. Oh no. This way. Oh you motherfucker.
[8963.90s -> 8981.14s]  All right. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I'm fine. Top left. Just move this way. A bunch of dogs.
[8981.94s -> 9001.86s]  Turn on the generator. Stamina. Get it back. Come on. Thank you for clapping for me. I'm here.
[9001.86s -> 9009.98s]  All right. I'm good. I didn't learn anything new. I didn't get anything new. I guess just survive
[9009.98s -> 9021.66s]  again and run this way tomorrow. I guess. I got rope. That's not gonna do shit for me.
[9022.38s -> 9041.34s]  How do I get back in my fucking house? Wait. Mushroom remains. Somebody's in your room.
[9042.06s -> 9046.68s]  You mean in the video game room or in like the actual room? Because I'm too scared to turn around.
[9051.35s -> 9063.66s]  I have to turn on the generator. Not quite yet though. It's still all right. All right.
[9065.50s -> 9077.66s]  Everything's still barricaded. I'm gonna. I'm gonna repair this.
[9078.46s -> 9094.07s]  Just so it's. Why is it red now? Okay. This is fine. This is fine. I can drink from the well tomorrow.
[9095.51s -> 9112.65s]  Uh doorway. Repair the doorway. Wait. Somebody got in here? That's not good. Was it always broken?
[9112.65s -> 9121.42s]  Oh. I think I'm all right then. All right. We're getting to be close to night time here.
[9121.50s -> 9128.55s]  Is there anything else I can do? All right. So the goal. Goal for tomorrow is to go down here.
[9129.85s -> 9132.49s]  Try to make at least somewhat of progress going down this way.
[9140.34s -> 9162.78s]  Right. I need lock picks too but I can't find any wiring. Turn off the lights and play in the dark.
[9164.38s -> 9170.60s]  It's 4 30 in the afternoon in Las Vegas. I can. It's. That's not going to work.
[9171.24s -> 9177.67s]  You're gonna have to wait another couple hours. I have no more gas either.
[9178.39s -> 9183.02s]  I actually really don't like this. What's happening right now because I don't have
[9183.02s -> 9190.10s]  any more gas. Close my blinds. They're. They're closed already. The sun is huge out here.
[9190.82s -> 9194.18s]  You're way close to the sun. To those who don't know Las Vegas is in the mountains.
[9194.18s -> 9197.70s]  So it's like 4 000 feet elevated closer to the sun. That's why it looks bigger.
[9198.58s -> 9213.93s]  That's why it's harder. Nothing else. Not one of these mazes. Something small I can just grab right
[9213.93s -> 9231.27s]  there. No. It's too risky. It's amazing that literally nothing I just said was correct.
[9235.26s -> 9249.56s]  Whatever. There is glass there. All right. I think it's time just to sit and just exist in here and
[9249.56s -> 9254.70s]  then I'll have enough money tomorrow. All right. Let's do it. Just turn it on.
[9259.45s -> 9273.77s]  So I should be able to buy some decent stuff tomorrow. It's in there, right? Yeah. Okay.
[9273.77s -> 9288.68s]  Live another day. Why are you doing Han Solo? What the hell do you guys know? All right. Bring
[9288.68s -> 9297.48s]  it on. Let's go. I have to pee too. I have to. I'm gonna take a break after this. He'll pee.
[9306.06s -> 9314.82s]  And then grab. I'm so sick of this happening. Again. We're only talking truth on this stream.
[9314.82s -> 9319.46s]  Only truth. I've showed this before but like seriously. We're only going to speak truth.
[9320.02s -> 9329.51s]  Okay. This is a razor death adder. I've used this mouse for years. I don't. I don't understand.
[9329.51s -> 9336.55s]  I need to. I needs to be explained. So why this. Why do you have this sticky thing over here that
[9336.55s -> 9341.22s]  can come off? Do you see what you see? What's that? I did. This is that's part of the mouse.
[9342.15s -> 9352.09s]  This thing is sticky. It's like glued on and it's the grip for the mouse. Why on earth is this
[9352.09s -> 9368.31s]  possible? Because now I can't put it back on. Why is this? Why is this like this? Yeah. I've tried
[9368.31s -> 9374.62s]  to put this back on like three or four times. You're supposed to buy a new one. This mouse is
[9374.62s -> 9380.86s]  less than six months old. It's like six or seven months old. Glue it back on but that's the problem.
[9380.86s -> 9385.58s]  It's never gonna fit the same way because it was like stuffed in and glued in there. I'm not sure
[9385.58s -> 9394.82s]  you can see this. It's this thing is bigger than this slot is. It was like stuffed in and glued
[9394.82s -> 9403.62s]  inside. Why is there even a grip on this mouse? What's the what does this grip do?
[9404.26s -> 9416.89s]  What's this grip? What's it here for? I did to grip my mouse? All that happens is you just get this
[9416.89s -> 9424.42s]  disgusting brown shit in there. That's it. Just collect it. It's a brown gamer shit collector.
[9424.42s -> 9439.48s]  I don't understand. And you can't just take it off and now I can't grab this because it's sticky.
[9439.48s -> 9443.08s]  Actually maybe that's the point. So now it's a super grip because now I stick to this when I hold
[9443.08s -> 9453.56s]  it. Am I alive? I'm still fine, right? I've owned the Death Adder. Different versions of it for like
[9453.56s -> 9462.28s]  15 years. Never have I seen the glued on weird grip thing on the edge. All right, I gotta pay
[9462.28s -> 9472.76s]  attention. I'm just gonna get an Amazon... Who opened that? Did I do that? I did. Did I do that?
[9480.70s -> 9507.53s]  Why did this open? Put the lamp on the door. Good call. Okay, I feel better now. I've used
[9507.53s -> 9515.75s]  a generic Microsoft mouse for eight years and I'm just fine. Yeah, I'm just gonna get the $4
[9515.75s -> 9526.14s]  Amazon mouse. Fake gamer. I use an Amazon keyboard. That thing is fine. It was $8.95.
[9526.94s -> 9549.59s]  It wasn't $300. Cheap gamer. My... Guys, we all have the same buttons. I have WASD on my keyboard.
[9549.59s -> 9558.42s]  So do you. I press W and I go up. You press W you go up too. You don't get extra keys. Maybe
[9558.42s -> 9568.87s]  some of them do. All the mouse has to do is left and right click with maybe a function button or
[9568.87s -> 9587.53s]  two like a mini scroll wheel. You don't have any optical buttons. Gamer keys. And when have you
[9587.53s -> 9593.21s]  ever used your gamer keys on your special keyboard? Because every time I've had a special keyboard,
[9593.21s -> 9600.34s]  they go untouched. In fact, I try to find ways to turn them off because I've never... I don't touch
[9600.34s -> 9605.14s]  them. Dust actually collected on some of my F keys on some of those like super function keys
[9605.70s -> 9614.10s]  because I've never touched them once. That's like having the help button on your Dell
[9614.66s -> 9618.79s]  keyboard and you would accidentally press it and you'd get the help screen would come up and you'd
[9618.79s -> 9634.20s]  be screaming at your monitor. Show us your keyboard. I've seen it before. It's an Amazon Basics.
[9634.92s -> 9643.08s]  Thing is cheap. But the buttons press and I move. Now if I really wanted to splurge,
[9643.72s -> 9650.92s]  you go for that like $29.99. The one that has the thing that stick... It lies down on two little
[9650.92s -> 9680.90s]  sticks and goes up at an angle. They didn't even come near me. I'm fine. My gamer keyboard. I want
[9680.90s -> 9692.09s]  to go home. Who's this? After you survive night, you gain reputation with the trader. All right,
[9692.09s -> 9718.81s]  cool. Who is this? Oops. What the fuck? Why did you do that? It's a... It's a vision. Not even real.
[9718.81s -> 9726.49s]  It's just a vision. All right. I have 200 bucks. I need to buy gasoline. I'm sorry, guys. Everyone's
[9726.49s -> 9731.58s]  going to be very upset about this, but I have to. I could get a metal pipe and make a gun.
[9731.58s -> 9754.06s]  Don't bite your lip. Omega low. Omega low. Why? How much is a watch? 200? 300. I can't. I don't
[9754.06s -> 9769.64s]  have enough. I need to live like another day or two. In the meantime... I need a torch. I have to do
[9769.64s -> 9781.56s]  one. I need a torch. I'm going to go anywhere. I already have a board with nails. Make torch
[9781.56s -> 9789.34s]  and explore that wedding chapel. That's what I was thinking of doing. Sell some stuff. I feel like
[9789.34s -> 9795.05s]  I need this stuff, though. Tire's not worth anything. Metal scrap I'll probably need. I'll
[9795.05s -> 9803.91s]  probably need some of this at some point. At least I think I do. Sell your useless stuff. I don't know
[9803.91s -> 9816.89s]  what's useless. Scrap metal. You can't go to the wedding. It's a waste of time. Okay. Well,
[9816.89s -> 9824.74s]  that's good to know. Hold on to my... Yeah, I'm going to hold on to this stuff. I'm going to go
[9824.74s -> 9832.74s]  explore the place I want to explore. I need healing, though. What can I get? I need two
[9832.74s -> 9842.58s]  pieces of cloth. That shouldn't be that hard to find, honestly. I really do need gasoline,
[9842.58s -> 9854.18s]  too. Hopefully I can find it. I can dodge by pressing control. Oh, that's really... Okay,
[9854.18s -> 9862.04s]  that's good to know. General. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I have like one more night in
[9862.04s -> 9867.96s]  this thing. This is going to be bad, isn't it? All right, I'm going to go down this way. Down.
[9869.02s -> 9886.22s]  Over and down. I have my torch, right? Get it on the bar. Poison. Don't touch it.
[9886.86s -> 9899.56s]  Just metal that trap. Get scrap metal. Perfect. Okay. Down. I'm trying to find a way through here.
[9900.12s -> 9908.57s]  Silent forest. There we go. Logs. Do I need these anymore, though? I feel like I don't even need
[9908.57s -> 9922.07s]  these. Do I need this shit? Important message. That was very important. I'm glad everybody just
[9922.07s -> 9932.94s]  told me. Very important stuff you guys are putting in the chat. I appreciate it. I just hit the
[9932.94s -> 9938.89s]  Windows button. Another key that should never exist anymore. There's no reason for that button
[9938.89s -> 9947.88s]  to exist. I have this theory that Microsoft... I have this theory, right? Pause the game. I have
[9947.96s -> 9954.76s]  theory that the reason why there's a Windows key on every single keyboard is because it's just free
[9954.76s -> 9960.79s]  advertisement for Windows. If it's on every single keyboard... Oh, that's the Windows key.
[9961.51s -> 9965.35s]  Every single company that makes a keyboard has it there. I'm surprised it's not on Mac keyboards.
[9966.07s -> 9972.86s]  Do they have to pay money to license that, by the way? If I want to make a keyboard and I'm going
[9972.86s -> 9978.38s]  to make the German 985 keyboard and there's a Windows key on it, do I have to pay Microsoft
[9978.86s -> 9985.56s]  fifteen cents a sale to do that? I'm actually serious. I'm actually asking this as a real
[9985.56s -> 9998.18s]  question. I'm not kidding around. Yes, I do. Do I? So why do most companies put it on there? Why
[9998.18s -> 10009.08s]  not just have a bigger control and a bigger alt? It's copyrighted. Who copyrighted the keyboard?
[10009.64s -> 10019.43s]  That's an important function. No, it's not. There's no keyboard copyright. You don't have to pay
[10019.43s -> 10024.47s]  anybody. Is there somebody that invented the keyboard like 40 years ago? And now you have to...
[10026.74s -> 10036.78s]  two-year Pepe dance. What? All right, I gotta go. Silent Forest looks like it's this way, but
[10036.78s -> 10043.43s]  I'm gonna move over here. This looks like the entrance to the Silent Forest if I was an entrance
[10043.43s -> 10056.76s]  to a forest that was supposed to be the entrance to this. There it is. All right, we got some
[10056.76s -> 10076.87s]  potential room here. There's a spot over here. Window? No. Fucking demons here or anything.
[10081.14s -> 10098.07s]  Stop singing. What are we doing? I need a... All right. Generator. Switch it on.
[10114.39s -> 10119.43s]  What is in there? How much gas is in this? Last one just for the visual.
[10120.47s -> 10158.18s]  Who is saying huh? Really? Every door has a lock? What is that? Hole. This place is infected with
[10158.18s -> 10169.99s]  something toxic. I need to find a way to get rid of it. I don't know. Burn? Burn it.
[10170.79s -> 10193.14s]  Burn it. Molotov cocktail. Okay, I gotta get this right. I only have one. Can I do it? Okay.
[10195.38s -> 10204.15s]  What about over here? I guess I can still take this stuff. Oven. Nothing in the oven?
[10204.95s -> 10216.62s]  All right, there's somebody in here. I heard him. Oh, come on. There's another one. How do I make a
[10216.62s -> 10248.36s]  Molotov cocktail? Wait. Are you serious? That's annoying. Okay. Further in? There's a guy in here.
[10248.92s -> 10275.85s]  I heard him. It's a bathtub. What's that? Egg. Something is floating inside. The skin looks to
[10275.85s -> 10286.86s]  be quite thin. Maybe I could puncture it or pierce it with something. An embryo. Get rid of something.
[10286.86s -> 10290.28s]  Get rid of something. Get rid of something. Get rid of something. What do I get rid of? I don't
[10290.28s -> 10307.91s]  know what to get rid of. I can't make the stone. And I'm gonna make a bandage. You fucking idiot.
[10307.91s -> 10333.16s]  You imbecile. Two bandages. Uh, no. Um, the rag? The meat. Give me that egg. I got it. Okay.
[10333.16s -> 10342.87s]  What? Bathtub. Search the bathtub. All right. I'm getting into uncharted territory here. There's
[10342.87s -> 10354.09s]  somebody. I heard the noise of somebody gurgling and stuff. Nothing else over here. Don't die in
[10354.09s -> 10381.61s]  here. Who's gonna be in this bedroom? Why is it so dark over here? What's that? There's a guy. Yeah,
[10381.61s -> 10420.62s]  there's somebody right there. The person. I just like had to press the number one and I just panicked
[10420.62s -> 10429.34s]  to a point where I could hit three times. Oh god damn it. I didn't even know what it was. I thought
[10429.34s -> 10434.06s]  it was going to be just a regular person. It was one of those guys with the giant spear halberds
[10436.47s -> 10442.49s]  and you have to hit them like seven times for them to die. I tried to press one, but I pressed the
[10442.49s -> 10446.87s]  tilde key, which by the way, why is that on a keyboard? I'm going to make a new, I'm going to
[10446.87s -> 10453.67s]  make a keyboard where all this useless shit is not on here. You know what I'm saying? I'm getting rid
[10453.67s -> 10460.07s]  of the tilde key. I'm getting rid of the windows key. I'm getting rid of whatever this is. What is
[10460.07s -> 10466.90s]  this? What is this like filing cabinet down here? Do you see this? What's the filing cabinet button
[10467.46s -> 10476.95s]  next to the alt key? What is that? What is this? What's that for? Page up, page down, you're out.
[10477.59s -> 10486.33s]  Scroll lock, pause, break. The music button. They're all gone. All of them. There's a music
[10486.33s -> 10496.28s]  button on here. I want a, I want a minimal keyboard with just the shit that you know you use.
[10496.28s -> 10503.77s]  Why can't I, why does it exist? The filing cabinet button opens the right click menu.
[10505.02s -> 10525.48s]  Why do I have a mouse? I want it to right click menu. Tiny, it's going to be a tiny little keyboard.
[10525.48s -> 10532.84s]  No, it'll just be all the QWERTY, all the numbers, all the function keys are gone, by the way.
[10534.01s -> 10540.86s]  No windows key. Tab can stay because it's useful. Caps lock can stay. All this like home, end,
[10540.86s -> 10549.82s]  insert. Just, I just need one, the delete key needs can be this big and sit right there. And
[10549.82s -> 10554.70s]  you know what else I don't like? The FN key is like a double function key. Nobody uses that many
[10554.70s -> 10562.98s]  keys. I can't think of any person I've ever come across my, hold on, I'm burning daylight here.
[10562.98s -> 10566.90s]  I can't think of one person I've ever come across in my entire life. And I mean my whole life
[10566.90s -> 10577.75s]  that has ever pressed the FN and a function key in my entire life. Even IT people. FN function,
[10577.75s -> 10584.62s]  for what? What do you use it for? What's it for? I want to see at least two or three different
[10584.62s -> 10594.60s]  scenarios where it's useful. For your volume. I want you to just, volume. So you, hold on,
[10594.60s -> 10607.74s]  so you need, you need, you need 24 function keys to raise and lower the volume of your computer.
[10607.74s -> 10611.26s]  I can understand. All right. If the tail of the key doesn't exist, that guy's dead.
[10612.20s -> 10618.06s]  And now I lost the, the fucking, I lost the egg. No, I didn't. Game's actually pretty fun. Never
[10618.06s -> 10626.55s]  mind. I was at, I bet, pretend that whole thing didn't happen. FN is for music control. Turn on
[10626.55s -> 10640.01s]  the radio. All right. Anyways, they've been making computers, they've been making keyboards
[10640.01s -> 10648.57s]  the same fucking way since like 1994. And nobody's decided to, the machines in the factory are set up
[10648.57s -> 10653.75s]  to always do it like this. So they're just like, I don't want to change that. I don't want to get
[10653.75s -> 10659.27s]  rid of that. It's important for no one. It's, it's for grandma to accidentally press and like
[10659.27s -> 10666.17s]  turn her brightness up. All right. I'm done with that. A little bit of an angry. I'm supposed to
[10666.17s -> 10675.11s]  pee. Brightness. No, if your screen's too bright, just go to the power options and just drag the bar.
[10675.83s -> 10679.83s]  I'm making a keyboard and I'm going to make trillion dollars. It's going to be the trillion
[10679.83s -> 10922.60s]  dollar keyboard. All right. I'll be right back. I gotta piss. Seriously, possibly imagine if you
[10922.60s -> 10927.24s]  were playing like God of War 2 on your Xbox and you accidentally press the filing cabinet button.
[10928.12s -> 10950.10s]  What, what's his image? What are you linking? I look like a skeleton. Okay. If you pause at
[10950.10s -> 10966.50s]  three seconds, I look like a skeleton. I'm talking about the video, not the stream,
[10966.50s -> 10972.58s]  the video that just got linked. All right. I'm ready. I'm ready. Oh, I hate losing.
[10974.50s -> 10977.30s]  What a super villain thing to say. I hate to lose.
[10979.62s -> 10988.17s]  Okay. Do the thing where some, the cartoon where somebody pulls your tongue out high
[10988.17s -> 10993.85s]  bar and lets it go. Wait, what are you talking about? I don't even know what that means. All
[10993.85s -> 11007.26s]  right. Let's go. Okay. What was I doing? I had this egg. I'm going to store the egg. I don't know
[11007.26s -> 11015.26s]  what it's for. I'm going to store this, store this, all of it. I guess if I killed that thing,
[11015.26s -> 11023.22s]  it would have been good. I need lost inventory. Wait, I can go get my inventory. What was that?
[11023.78s -> 11040.14s]  Show him the germ. Show it to him. What do you mean? What do you got? Something here?
[11040.14s -> 11047.90s]  What? I saw that. Yeah. I saw it. Yeah. It was me being funny. It was me doing that on purpose.
[11047.90s -> 11060.44s]  I was doing like a funny face. You know, I want to like, all right, somebody said cook egg.
[11060.44s -> 11072.55s]  Are you for real? Does that work? Should I cook egg? Draw my perfect keyboard. I can't
[11077.14s -> 11088.17s]  make it. Oh, that's all right. Okay. Cook egg. Oh, 40 essence. Nice. Okay. That's worth a lot.
[11092.46s -> 11100.63s]  Now this is a hard game. This is a very hard game. It takes a lot of patience. I
[11100.63s -> 11105.03s]  imagine playing this game on nightmare or whatever the hell it is. It's going to rain again.
[11108.22s -> 11117.34s]  Should have hatched it. Can you do that? That's weird. All right. I'm going to go.
[11117.66s -> 11124.89s]  Oh, where am I going to go? I've been here. I this this wolf's camp I can go up to,
[11124.89s -> 11132.46s]  but I'm not like I'm not good enough to go up yet. I need a I need to not panic when I see it's
[11132.46s -> 11137.80s]  just that I feel the same way when I ever came across the butcher in Diablo one. I had the same
[11137.80s -> 11144.04s]  reaction. Same exact perspective. Same exact scenario. It was around a corner. And he would
[11144.04s -> 11150.73s]  just it was terrifying. I couldn't do it. It was scary because you couldn't see. All right.
[11152.57s -> 11161.26s]  I don't know what exactly time it is. And I don't have any gasoline. This is the last day
[11161.26s -> 11165.58s]  that I can do this without needing to forcibly. I need to get gasoline. This is the last night
[11165.58s -> 11180.33s]  I can do this. Try try to go get my inventory. I think I'm gonna try to get it. I know that
[11180.33s -> 11184.25s]  guy's in there. I just have to dodge and hit him. I'm going for it.
[11197.72s -> 11224.95s]  Is my hand slippery and fucking in rain? What is going on? Now, instead of being go find logs
[11224.95s -> 11244.89s]  for an hour. Now go find rags for an hour. At least there are plenty of those. That's true.
[11245.53s -> 11253.54s]  That is correct. You're right. Although this thing's almost broken and it's I need that watch.
[11254.87s -> 11257.75s]  I would literally sell everything in my inventory tomorrow to get that watch.
[11258.79s -> 11268.47s]  I hate not knowing how much time I have. It's killing me. I need to repair this weapon. Don't
[11268.47s -> 11298.17s]  step on that glass. Just do it. I need another torch. I wish there was a mode in this game where
[11298.17s -> 11303.74s]  there was just a big box that had 10 of every single one of these in them. Just to get you going.
[11310.71s -> 11324.65s]  It's getting late. Yeah. But I can't turn the thing on yet. Right when I feel like I'm getting
[11324.65s -> 11332.98s]  going, I have to hide in this house and be terrified. I guess that's the point, right?
[11333.62s -> 11347.16s]  I need, I'm going to make like four torches or five torches or something. I need alcohol, matches,
[11348.04s -> 11361.58s]  planks, and rags. Is this going to be enough if I turn it on now? I see a booger. No, you don't.
[11368.78s -> 11382.76s]  I hope this is enough. Otherwise, I'm dead. Where? What? What are you talking about? Stop.
[11386.14s -> 11391.93s]  All right. Pray that this is enough because then I'll have enough money to hopefully buy some stuff.
[11391.93s -> 11407.53s]  This is why I can't have face cam. I've told you this a thousand times. B omega booger.
[11407.53s -> 11419.18s]  There's a booger on the door behind you. Imagine if I moved out of the way and there was just this
[11419.18s -> 11431.32s]  six or seven month long booger wall. When I was, it's nighttime, so we had to talk about some of
[11431.32s -> 11445.83s]  these things. When I was like, maybe seven or eight years old in my bedroom, you know what's
[11445.83s -> 11459.88s]  coming. The wall next to my bedroom, because my bed was right up against the wall, right up against
[11459.88s -> 11479.05s]  the wall. But I was, when I was eight, maybe like seven or eight years old, every, every single night
[11482.07s -> 11493.54s]  it would go. And I thought I was being so sneaky. We know what it is. I'm not going to say it. I don't
[11493.54s -> 11502.90s]  need to, but there would be a collection hidden. And anytime we would rearrange the room,
[11503.46s -> 11508.50s]  if my mother wanted to rearrange the beds or, Hey, we're going to change this. So we're going
[11508.50s -> 11527.51s]  to change some stuff. What is this? I was like seven. I was, I was a literal child. Okay.
[11528.39s -> 11552.39s]  This didn't happen two weeks ago. Seven's too old to be, you puked in your mom's bed two weeks ago,
[11552.39s -> 11560.71s]  more like nine years ago. I threw up in my bed. Yeah, but that was like, that was like a decade
[11560.71s -> 11573.14s]  old. More than that. That was 10 years ago. You were 25. Yeah. I had to fuck. I puked. I had to
[11573.14s -> 11581.45s]  throw up. I was sick. I didn't feel well. What? You've never thrown up before unexpectedly.
[11586.23s -> 11600.30s]  This is like red light coming through here right now. How did you get in here? How did he get in
[11600.30s -> 11613.80s]  here? How did he get in here? Well, I need this stuff. How did he get in here? Oh, the door.
[11630.30s -> 11658.46s]  I'm going to sneeze. Oh, come on, please close the door. I need to go outside.
[11659.42s -> 11668.68s]  Light will do it. I need to like, look out the window. Come on. Really? You're not going to let
[11668.68s -> 11674.38s]  me do this stupid joke that I want to do? Mother nature. Why? I was going to get up and sneeze
[11674.38s -> 11688.79s]  into the wall right here. And well, not anymore, apparently. Quick, do a windows key. No, I got,
[11688.79s -> 11698.07s]  I got seven monitors here. They're all bright. You know, I was trying to think of what I would
[11698.07s -> 11706.68s]  do with like five, six, seven monitors. People have that. I'm trying to think of, okay, if I had
[11708.38s -> 11723.22s]  stream labs, OBS, web browser, game or whatever right here. Chat. What, what, what could you do
[11723.22s -> 11736.68s]  with four monitors? More than four. Look at the five monitors. For what? What would you put on them?
[11737.56s -> 11744.68s]  Put stocks on one. I guess that's true. All right. Well, I did it. Another day. Trade. What do I got?
[11744.68s -> 11752.49s]  300 and I'm going to get the watch. I'm going for it. No, but I need a gasoline.
[11753.21s -> 11776.02s]  Was it 48 watch or gasoline necessity or vanity? No, I don't sell it back to him for 150. Put it
[11776.02s -> 11785.80s]  back over here. All right. I need gas though. So let's sell some of these. I'll sell you a,
[11786.60s -> 11798.58s]  hold on. I need 48 time. Eight, eight AM. Now I have that forever, right? And this can't break.
[11799.38s -> 11807.46s]  All right. Does he buy logs? No, I need those logs. He'll buy pills though. Whatever. I don't
[11807.46s -> 11815.61s]  need these for anything. I'm not going to do drugs. That's 30. Maybe some scrap metal. Sell the watch
[11818.92s -> 11833.66s]  stones. Battery. I'm going to sell both drugs. Sell the meat. I got, I don't have any more meat.
[11834.22s -> 11853.10s]  At least I do. Okay. I don't think I need it. So let's go pills. That's 35.
[11854.46s -> 11864.47s]  I actually don't have to sell these pills. Grab the gasoline. I'll take it. All right. We're fine.
[11864.47s -> 11876.97s]  Okay. Refill. And I have a watch. So it's eight AM permanently until I leave.
[11877.93s -> 11908.04s]  I need to fill this. Looks good. It's almost empty. Night starts at 20. Good to know. Tank is empty.
[11908.04s -> 11916.74s]  Let's go turn it off. I now have enough for at least one or two nights. There's nothing else in
[11916.74s -> 11924.84s]  here. Put the pills back. Have the watch. Put everything back. Bring a rag with me.
[11926.87s -> 11934.30s]  And why is this? The only two rope can fit on one. All right. Bottle. No. All right. I need
[11935.10s -> 11943.66s]  torch. I need, I need like an alcohol or something to put to, I don't have any. I have nothing.
[11944.22s -> 11956.15s]  I have nothing. I'm going to get this to, I have to make this full. I have to. Okay. I've got my
[11956.15s -> 11963.19s]  watch. I've got my board. I'm going down here to get my inventory. It's just one person down there.
[11963.19s -> 11980.04s]  I've got my watch. I'm ready to go. Let's go. Good luck for your law degree. Thanks. I'm trying.
[11980.04s -> 11990.10s]  Don't mess this up. I need to find mushrooms too. Okay. Perfect. I need to just kill the
[11990.10s -> 11995.02s]  dude that's in here. I don't want to take any unnecessary stuff in my inventory.
[11995.74s -> 12004.57s]  So essentially it's one minute a second kind of, sort of. All right. Here we go. Into the woods.
[12006.12s -> 12010.36s]  Is that guy just out of the house now? Or is he going to be standing somewhere in particular?
[12011.24s -> 12018.82s]  This is going to, okay. Don't panic. Don't accidentally press one of the 17 useless
[12018.82s -> 12036.86s]  keys on the keyboard that you have. He's going to be right here somewhere. How did I get down
[12036.86s -> 12066.95s]  there before? Through the other side? Okay. What's that? What is that? Is it a bug? What's that?
[12069.59s -> 12090.81s]  Dead bug. Bug. Shell. Where the hell is he? Fucking butcher. Hold on. There's no gas in here.
[12099.43s -> 12152.84s]  Not shift. You motherfucker. Where are you? Okay. All right. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[12152.84s -> 12202.22s]  Come on out. One, two, three, go. That's it, right? Nobody else. Okay. Alcohol. Note.
[12203.10s -> 12207.58s]  The door code is three, three, three, three. It can't get any easier. Remember it. I'm not opening
[12207.58s -> 12212.70s]  that door after dark anymore. I went to get some gasoline from the pig shed. I'll be back after
[12212.70s -> 12232.44s]  dark. Gas from the pig shed. What is that? Shiny stone for the 130 bucks. All right. I need to
[12232.44s -> 12249.91s]  use bandage. Is my inventory down here somewhere? Where's my inventory? Where is it? Is it not here?
[12252.04s -> 12273.11s]  Corpse. Chair. Wardrobe. Take all that stuff. Lamp. Oh, backpack. All right. I'm leaving.
[12273.11s -> 12279.11s]  I know the code and I know that there's gasoline in the pig shed. I'm out. What time is it? 11.
[12279.11s -> 12294.31s]  That's enough time to get out of here. Code two. All right. Get me out. I'm panicking right now.
[12294.31s -> 12308.12s]  I'm just so fucking nervous. What's that noise? Why is there a noise? The thing's about to be out.
[12308.84s -> 12346.33s]  Three, three, three, three. Sleeper. Sleeper. Who's sleeping? Shotgun and a map of the forest.
[12347.53s -> 12358.12s]  Is the guy sleeping? What do I do? Should I kill him? He's going to get up and he's going to attack
[12358.12s -> 12366.90s]  me. Right? I have to leave. Hey there, friend. Hey there. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Yes. In the last hideout,
[12369.61s -> 12395.54s]  look for an exit beneath the floor. He's going to fuck. He's a friend. He's going to get up and
[12395.54s -> 12407.46s]  run up just like that. Like I told you. He called you friend. That doesn't matter. I have to leave
[12407.46s -> 12415.54s]  now. I'm not going this way. Anybody that's alive is going to stand up and sprint at you. That's how
[12415.54s -> 12422.58s]  these games work. I can't let that happen. Not with this much stuff in my inventory and no torches,
[12422.58s -> 12433.78s]  by the way. So, okay. I have to leave now. I have to leave right now. Get out of here now.
[12434.98s -> 12450.70s]  Please get me out. I don't know how to get out of here. Okay. There it is. I'm sorry. If an NPC
[12450.70s -> 12458.54s]  has a dialogue option that's like trade, gossip, talk. We're good. If you're rolling around on the
[12458.54s -> 12474.46s]  ground and I don't know who you are and there is no dialogue options. He's a friend. There are no
[12474.46s -> 12484.17s]  such thing as friends. Not in a post-apocalyptic world. I made it though. I don't have enough
[12484.17s -> 12498.44s]  gasoline. All right. I can't look at chat anymore. Sorry. No more chatting. And so why am I just doing
[12498.44s -> 12526.78s]  that? All right. I'm here. No. Now I'm in the wrong spot. So, 3-3. That's how you get down
[12528.79s -> 12534.25s]  here. And then this is the silent forest hideout. I'm assuming I eventually have to end up up here
[12534.25s -> 12545.08s]  somewhere. Here we go. Let's fill this up with the gas that we have. No. Which I should have. I got
[12545.08s -> 12551.54s]  plenty. What is this? A piece of wood? A staff made of wooden unknown origin. And I have shotgun
[12551.54s -> 12572.28s]  shells too. This is pretty good. Okay. Let's fill this up. Not bad. Now this is a weapon. Let me go
[12572.28s -> 12583.40s]  back. Let me go to my weapon crafting bench. Let's see if I have anything new to do. Upgrade
[12583.40s -> 12597.91s]  workshop. I need, I don't know, is that toolbox? Shell, rag, alcohol. Okay. Let me make some more.
[12597.91s -> 12605.86s]  Shiny stone. That's worth a lot. All right. Let's take out the bandages. I have three bandages.
[12606.58s -> 12620.57s]  An image link is here. It's all right. Torch. I can make one. So make one. I need board. I can.
[12623.53s -> 12629.48s]  All right. I can make three torches. I need to turn on the thing out here. Let's do that.
[12635.26s -> 12644.70s]  Is it a bear or something? What was that? 25 fuel. Shit. Shouldn't have used it all, huh?
[12647.98s -> 12660.50s]  What happened to my watch? Oh, it's in the workshop. Never take that watch off. Ever. That's
[12660.50s -> 12680.52s]  fine. Alcohol. I have three bandages. One torch. Board with nails. Upgrades. Hardened. More nails
[12680.52s -> 12702.02s]  and light. And flex more. Yeah. All right. Prepare it. I need boards and uh-oh. Should I have done
[12702.02s -> 12715.75s]  that booger eating stance? Everyone's focusing on boogers and pee. That sounds about right. I need
[12715.75s -> 12723.32s]  more fuel, which means I have to live tonight and then buy fuel tomorrow. Yeah. That's the play.
[12724.60s -> 12738.30s]  I got enough. Let me see. Let me just lock some doors here. I need some supplies. Right there.
[12739.10s -> 12750.10s]  I actually think I want to bring this into the other room. That was a nice reference. Somebody
[12750.10s -> 12761.69s]  else said it on me. These are all still good. I can't cook anything. Oven efficiency one. How
[12761.69s -> 12779.61s]  do I make my oven better? This is still good. All this is still fine. The other hideouts. Oh, okay.
[12781.83s -> 12786.78s]  I see. I feel you. All right. So we got to get ready.
[12788.81s -> 12798.50s]  Pull this back. What do I think about the game so far? The visibility thing seems frustrating,
[12798.50s -> 12805.72s]  but cool. Oh, I think it's, I think it's good. I think I'm slowly starting to understand what
[12805.72s -> 12818.15s]  I'm even supposed to be doing, but uh, I think it's good. I think it's fun. He hates it. Well,
[12818.15s -> 12828.78s]  I mean, I'll probably uninstall it after this stream today, but I'm kidding. It's a joke. All
[12828.78s -> 12840.68s]  right. At least you're honest. We'll see how far I get. Torch. Free bandages. I need to repair this
[12841.32s -> 12845.91s]  before it becomes too late. Although while there's still some time left,
[12846.95s -> 12852.44s]  I'm going to go see if I can find some nails. Where have I not gone? I haven't gone like over
[12852.44s -> 12863.42s]  here. I'm just going to check it out really quick. Is it a survival game? Yeah, kind of.
[12864.58s -> 12887.30s]  It's a top down, it's a top down horror survival esque game. So yeah, it is. Okay.
[12887.86s -> 12896.25s]  Dry meadow. I'm up here now somewhere around 19 or so. I got to turn around. Nothing over here.
[12896.81s -> 12908.82s]  You know, like random logs or anything. Oh, if you have any of the horror games that I have not
[12908.82s -> 12917.53s]  played on stream, at least, or in a while toss them in the recommended for the discord because
[12920.10s -> 12923.62s]  I would play a bunch of horror games this month because obviously it makes sense. Right.
[12924.42s -> 12932.79s]  This is not, I'm not going to find anything over here. No, it's not worth it.
[12933.35s -> 12943.69s]  I just need to live one more day. Yeah, it's not worth it. Let's get me out of here.
[12944.97s -> 12962.01s]  Do PT. Didn't I do PT on stream? I don't remember. I know I played PT, but did I play on stream? I
[12962.01s -> 12967.61s]  don't know. Probably not. All right. I have to get the hell out of here. I must return to my hideup
[12967.61s -> 12981.48s]  before night. I know that's what I'm doing. Let's hide. So it was a good game.
[12985.85s -> 13011.50s]  I have heard it's a good game. How long is Soma? Move the bookcase like eight hours.
[13012.06s -> 13023.64s]  That's not bad. That's good. Check the door doors. Oh, okay. Good, good, good, good, good.
[13024.52s -> 13039.96s]  All right. Close this one. Lock it up. It's like two to three average German streams, but one
[13039.96s -> 13043.64s]  playthrough of Soma. Everybody's saying that I'm not going to be capable of beating it in like eight
[13043.64s -> 13052.62s]  hours. I think it's going to take me like 20 plus hours to beat it. What did you say? It might take
[13052.62s -> 13061.11s]  me 20 hours to beat that game. Is that some kind of challenge? It's around 16 hours. Well, that's
[13061.11s -> 13073.14s]  double what the last person said. The number would be good too. We'll check them out. All right. I
[13073.14s -> 13079.32s]  got to pay attention because this is an important day because then after this, we're going down to
[13079.32s -> 13089.78s]  the silent forest hideout. Every time I talk about something random during this, nothing happens.
[13090.34s -> 13105.69s]  I need another topic to go off on. Oh, my stream title is terrible. That's really bad. When your
[13105.69s -> 13110.25s]  stream title is the name of the game category and there's no difference. When somebody's browsing
[13110.25s -> 13114.09s]  through Twitch, it just says Darkwood Darkwood. And they think that there's something wrong with
[13114.09s -> 13124.02s]  their browser. And then they don't come to the stream. I should put Darkwood. I should put this
[13124.02s -> 13129.99s]  in brackets. Yeah, that's not a bad idea. So it's like the title is Darkwood Brackets one.
[13133.66s -> 13156.42s]  Yeah, that's not a bad idea. Okay. So now if you go out to the Twitch browser,
[13157.38s -> 13164.54s]  it'll say like Darkwood Darkwood one and you'll wait. They named it twice, but that's weird.
[13166.55s -> 13177.27s]  Looks a bit weird. Don't refresh. Well, yeah, I wouldn't refresh because you'll get an ad.
[13177.99s -> 13193.27s]  Somebody here. How are they in here? Are they in here? He's fighting the dogs outside. That was
[13193.27s -> 13196.31s]  really close. That was right outside the door. He's not going to like shoot a gun in here, right?
[13196.95s -> 13223.99s]  They don't sophisticated. Do they? I'm going to assume morning is like five, like 530.
[13236.87s -> 13245.38s]  Are they people or are they zombies? I really don't know. I think they're infected people.
[13246.10s -> 13266.98s]  Can you sleep? You cannot sleep. You have to just weather the storm. They can't get in.
[13266.98s -> 13273.03s]  This is a good strategy. I like this. Two lamps in front of the door, both barricaded.
[13274.15s -> 13280.65s]  Do I think that hot lava is worth buying? Um, it depends on how much you'd like to jump
[13281.37s -> 13301.06s]  and grab stuff. Who did it? Answer it. Did we get him? Did we get the streamer?
[13303.54s -> 13336.52s]  Close the door. He's throwing. Oh no, don't die in here. Oh, please. Why did you open it? I was
[13336.52s -> 13345.62s]  closing it. Oh no. How did he get in? Did he actually get in? He got in and it's one of these
[13345.62s -> 13352.66s]  guys. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm blocked. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead here. Just don't. What
[13352.66s -> 13369.54s]  do I do? Come on, Foxy's right in front of me. Duckies to my right. I can hear Freddy. I can
[13369.54s -> 13396.15s]  hear him through this ear. I need to do something about that. I can't continue like that. Gasoline's
[13396.15s -> 13402.58s]  the easy answer to be able to get planks. I'm going to bring the dresser. Yeah, that's not a
[13402.58s -> 13411.69s]  bad idea. Weapon parts. I have something for you actually. I have something for you. Should I sell
[13411.69s -> 13421.99s]  the jewel? Whatever it is. Cause I have some stuff that's worth some money. I got pills. I got the
[13422.23s -> 13431.00s]  shells. It's worth 130 bucks. Shiny stone. I don't think I'm ever gonna have a shotgun.
[13431.72s -> 13449.96s]  At least not now. I'm just gonna do it. Whatever. If it's a bad idea, it's a bad idea. It's okay
[13449.96s -> 13468.28s]  though. I need stuff now, not stuff later. 200. I'll have a lot. Which then can get me
[13471.08s -> 13484.95s]  fabric. I need this. I still need gas too though. Handgun, bolt handle, long barrel.
[13485.75s -> 13502.52s]  What about the axe, blade, shovel? There's too many things to do.
[13507.14s -> 13516.42s]  I don't know. There's too many diff. I don't know. I don't know.
[13520.41s -> 13530.36s]  Wire. It's done. Whatever it is, it's done. Gasoline too. Bucket. Like I need it. Okay.
[13530.36s -> 13549.08s]  Front door. Front door. Front door. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
[13550.12s -> 13566.10s]  All right. The front door. Now I need something better than that. All right. Now I need to fill
[13566.10s -> 13597.66s]  this up a little bit. Okay. Turn this generator off. Sour Jupiter. Really? Nice job. All right.
[13597.66s -> 13607.72s]  Now I can make... What the hell happened? Lockpick. At least I have a lockpick now.
[13608.44s -> 13615.58s]  I need to repair this, which means I have to go... Wait. Did I turn it off?
[13616.46s -> 13629.22s]  I did, right? Yeah. Why do I have loud P? That's an old reference that I have not seen in a very long
[13629.22s -> 13641.45s]  time. It's been a while. All right. Planks. Need them. Planks. Need them. Planks. Need them. Plenty
[13641.45s -> 13648.42s]  now. Repair this. It now does more damage, which is good. And then I need to move some stuff.
[13649.14s -> 13680.63s]  Oh, shit. I need nails. What was that? You guys heard that, right? All right. Can I buy nails?
[13681.86s -> 13702.25s]  I can. Just give me 10. I heard that if somebody was walking around. All right. Now this thing is
[13702.25s -> 13717.90s]  good. How many torches do I have? Zero. I want at least two. Seems good to me. I need whatever that
[13717.90s -> 13728.23s]  is. I am going to board this shuttle, because what's the point of leaving out this front door?
[13728.87s -> 13735.08s]  There is none. I always go out the back door anyways. I need more nails. I need two more nails.
[13736.20s -> 13756.65s]  Don't do that. Why not? No, I'm doing it. That's how they keep getting in. Dermot, you answer the
[13756.65s -> 13770.89s]  door when it knocks at night. Should I really be doing that? Okay. Give me the other gasoline.
[13770.89s -> 13791.46s]  I'll take it. All right. I'm done. Lockpick. Get rid of the boards. Keep two torches. One in the...
[13792.26s -> 13796.98s]  here. Get rid of the bottle. Get rid of the stone. Keep the bandages. Keep the lockpick.
[13798.20s -> 13804.60s]  It's time to explore. I'm ready. I'm going for it. I've got a good weapon now. I'm going...
[13805.40s -> 13815.29s]  I don't know. Burn down house. Or the... I mean, this is where I need to go.
[13815.85s -> 13826.89s]  I can go up. Okay. I'm gonna go up. Up. I have heels, right? I have three bandages.
[13827.53s -> 13867.02s]  Let's go. I'm gonna go straight up into the air. Go that way. Ah, this is a high-level zone.
[13868.15s -> 13887.21s]  I went into the high-level zone. Where are you going? Where are you going?
[13887.21s -> 13947.21s]  Where's it going? Why'd it do that? I got a shiny stone. I got it. Why is there a rooster? All right.
[13948.09s -> 13957.30s]  Why did they run away? Is this dog dead? This dog doesn't look dead.
[13959.64s -> 13973.05s]  Where am I? Where the hell am I? Oh, this is the burnt house. I can do this now.
[13991.75s -> 14003.03s]  I can do this shit now. All right. Stuff. Stuff. Anything. Search the sack. Alcohol.
[14004.57s -> 14010.55s]  Bedding. Nobody in the bed. Wardrobe. Oh, there's a flare in here and there's pills in here, too.
[14011.43s -> 14021.72s]  A note from the burnt house. I know they're there. I can hear them laughing. They're behind the wall
[14021.72s -> 14029.67s]  of trees. I can't get through by myself. The trees go... grow back too fast. Double mushroom.
[14030.23s -> 14056.15s]  Oh, this is perfect. Mushrooms. Just behind the trees. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Sofa.
[14057.19s -> 14104.14s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. All right. I might be a little up.
[14104.62s -> 14114.26s]  I'm pretty close to leveling up, I think. Without a doubt. All right. Easy. Come on over here.
[14114.26s -> 14131.88s]  There's a red log. Come here. Come on. What's a red log? There's a pig. Right? The pig. What?
[14131.88s -> 14139.14s]  The pig door? The pig door, right? Something was just on my leg. I'm not kidding. What was it?
[14139.70s -> 14162.04s]  I don't know. I felt something. I promise. Didn't the guy say that there was a pig?
[14164.90s -> 14177.94s]  Red seesaw. What's the significance of the red seesaw? I have a lot of mushrooms now.
[14185.80s -> 14200.34s]  Nothing in here. What? I swear there was a pig door. No. All right. Well, I got the burnt down
[14200.34s -> 14235.16s]  house now. Check the sofa lol. Sofa lol. All right. Okay. White dress. A white child-sized press.
[14237.67s -> 14246.36s]  And the thing that's $450. Do not die. Get this back so I can- that's a lot of money.
[14246.36s -> 14283.37s]  Let me see. Right there. All right. I'm up. Why am I- people are asking why I'm killing the dogs.
[14283.93s -> 14290.66s]  Because they're trying to kill me and I'm just trying to live. I've got a $450
[14290.66s -> 14303.48s]  piece of fabric in my back. I am not going to lose that one. Bingo. Nice. All right.
[14305.34s -> 14345.30s]  Every time. I swear. Hot bar upgrade. Inventory upgrade. Okay. I wanted the slots. Only two slots.
[14351.19s -> 14371.24s]  Antidote. No, no. I want to level up. Speaking of that. 120 out of 150. I need three more mushrooms
[14371.24s -> 14380.36s]  and I get to level up. Almost new powers. Yeah, I just need three more mushrooms. Oh, that's cool.
[14380.36s -> 14385.32s]  All right. Nice. So the burnt house is pretty much completed. The wedding though. I don't have the
[14385.40s -> 14392.12s]  key code to get in. I should be making some traps. All right. So let's go with chain trap
[14394.14s -> 14401.10s]  and then I'm going to go with bear trap and then I'm going to go chain trap again. Bear trap.
[14403.27s -> 14410.20s]  Now let's take a look. Repair item. Get that completed. I still have a lot of time so I'm
[14410.20s -> 14423.24s]  not going to do this yet. I have a lot of junk in my inventory. I can do this again?
[14424.12s -> 14433.27s]  No, only once. All right. I'm going to take this time here to try and find a chest to open,
[14433.27s -> 14438.09s]  which I think there was a couple over here. I still have about four hours or so.
[14446.12s -> 14458.84s]  There was a chest over here somewhere. Like legitimately right here. Pretty good. Yeah,
[14458.84s -> 14471.85s]  I think that deserves a few peepo dances. Nothing else? Oh, I got a couple of these now.
[14472.49s -> 14491.62s]  I'm going to be making some money now dog. Excuse me. By the way, you can always tell when I look
[14491.62s -> 14509.61s]  at chat when I go like this is that you guys are right there. All right. Now this is the underground
[14509.61s -> 14514.94s]  passage place, which I can't do anything here. This is the end game. That's how you leave. That's
[14514.94s -> 14534.01s]  how you win. I'm trying to find mushrooms though in the few hours I have. Win, win, win, win, win.
[14534.01s -> 14540.90s]  I can't win. Not yet. I'm going to head. I'm going back down towards wedding, but I need to find a
[14540.90s -> 14558.46s]  couple more mushroom. I've already done this. And the anime is lame. All right. I, why are you
[14558.46s -> 14596.89s]  saying that? Where did that come from? Wire, alcohol, magazine. Is it GQ or better homes and
[14596.89s -> 14635.29s]  gardens? Just farming those minus twos. Don't mind me. Minus two for every dog that you kill.
[14635.93s -> 14662.84s]  It's not fair. I can't. It's too far away. All right. I've got to get back.
[14665.26s -> 14674.15s]  My face came too dark. Oh, I'll fix it later. Where the hell am I? Oh, wait a minute.
[14674.79s -> 14685.72s]  Is this back at the? Yep. All right. This is back at the scrap yard. Yeah. All right. Let's go.
[14686.44s -> 14695.19s]  Ooh, that's a corpse area. I missed no room and inventory.
[14697.42s -> 14729.46s]  Shit. I need those nails. Uh, what was that? I don't, nevermind. Let's get me out of here.
[14730.18s -> 14743.24s]  All right. What should I eat? What do you guys think? What do you think is the number one thing
[14743.24s -> 14748.42s]  I should eat? Oh, nevermind. I can't eat anything. That's you guys would suggest.
[14750.50s -> 14755.50s]  Right. I'm on like, I'm on a, nevermind. I have to eat the stuff that's in the fridge.
[14756.30s -> 14762.44s]  Dammit. That sucks. I can't eat like loaded potato skins. Like somebody just said, I have to eat
[14764.26s -> 14772.31s]  lettuce, like plain meat. I have to do a FODMAP diet for like a week or two.
[14773.11s -> 14783.08s]  But should you guys know how hard it is to do a FODMAP diet? A FODMAP diet is you cannot have
[14783.08s -> 14790.81s]  any form of garlic or onion or fructose, essentially. It's a carbohydrate thing.
[14791.77s -> 14800.73s]  And weirdly enough, garlic and onion is in every single goddamn food in this entire country of the
[14800.73s -> 14807.53s]  United States of America. Garlic powder, onion salt, onion powder. It's in everything. It's
[14807.53s -> 14814.04s]  in every single food in the whole country. So I can't really go out to eat until I figure that
[14814.04s -> 14823.86s]  out. Oh, and I love onions. I love, okay, hold on. I love onions. I love garlic. It's one of my
[14823.86s -> 14829.75s]  favorite things on earth, but I cannot eat it for a while. That's the unfortunate thing. I don't
[14829.75s -> 14838.79s]  know. I got a lot of gas, so I'm going to go sell this magazine. No, I think I can, let's just turn
[14838.79s -> 14888.17s]  it on. Let's just, I got plenty of gas, but now I need to block this door. I ain't dying. Okay. It's

[17005.51s -> 17008.63s]  my way here i don't recognize myself anymore
[17008.63s -> 17012.63s]  i can barely hold this pencil has my body changed i no longer feel
[17012.63s -> 17018.82s]  hunger or thirst what is happening to me i remember his face the face of the man
[17018.82s -> 17022.34s]  who saved me then held me captive i don't know how i
[17022.34s -> 17025.70s]  managed to escape his hut ended up here what i do know is that the
[17025.70s -> 17029.30s]  insane fucker took my key my only chance to
[17029.30s -> 17033.46s]  get out of the woods he also took out all the pages from my
[17033.46s -> 17037.14s]  journal i doubt that he was able to learn the location of the
[17037.14s -> 17040.02s]  underground passage though i should check if the door is still
[17040.02s -> 17044.18s]  locked just to be sure i must find him i don't think he
[17044.18s -> 17047.46s]  still lives in the same place where he held me makes no difference
[17047.46s -> 17050.98s]  as i have no idea how to get back to that vile place
[17050.98s -> 17057.54s]  this the time's not going forward i thought that was going to be burning
[17057.54s -> 17065.61s]  time and now my hands are tingly because i've
[17065.61s -> 17080.55s]  leaned back that was a yawn that that was almost a yawn
[17080.55s -> 17085.03s]  but don't yawn on stream because then people think you're bored or tired
[17085.03s -> 17088.31s]  don't yawn on stream that's a good tip for you
[17088.31s -> 17091.91s]  if you're gonna if you're gonna be a streamer don't yawn on stream
[17091.91s -> 17095.99s]  it makes people think that you're fucking tired and bored and not unsatisfied
[17095.99s -> 17126.44s]  take it from me yeah they come you can always tell when someone's trying to
[17126.44s -> 17129.32s]  hold a yawn because they look like a lizard that just
[17129.32s -> 17148.57s]  ate a bug they go if you didn't know speaking of
[17148.57s -> 17153.61s]  lizards did i tell you guys that i was thinking
[17153.61s -> 17158.84s]  about getting a couple of like frogs or like a bearded dragon did i tell
[17158.84s -> 17161.88s]  you guys this i'm thinking about getting a bearded
[17161.88s -> 17170.62s]  dragon and they like so they're cool or like two
[17170.62s -> 17174.76s]  like a couple of tree frogs they're real chill yeah i've heard that

[17293.70s -> 17298.26s]  sour emote i thought it was a germa yawn emote they could both be the same thing
[17298.26s -> 17303.30s]  that's the start of a yawn or jeremy just ate a bug and he's a lizard
[17303.30s -> 17307.45s]  that has endless possibilities i think
[17307.77s -> 17334.01s]  why are there bugs in here come on hurry up and turn to dawn
[17334.01s -> 17358.52s]  before he gets in no day number nine day nine gain reputation 100

[17427.93s -> 17434.41s]  it to the dog guy so sell antlers to dog guy and then

[21631.32s -> 21634.68s]  to buy a rear pattern before anyone else could
[21634.68s -> 21638.36s]  it did multiple macro functions at once within the period of a few seconds

[21689.42s -> 21692.68s]  thousand miles per hour and he just gets booted and we just
[21692.68s -> 21701.61s]  kept getting booted from the game you had to it was a joke though it was
[21701.61s -> 21703.93s]  not oh let me just spin around with my mouse
[21703.93s -> 21707.45s]  you had to turn your dpi up to like 10 000
[21707.45s -> 21710.89s]  and then just have your character go like a blender in a circle
[21710.89s -> 21720.14s]  and you get you got like kicked out there's a video from like

[22162.50s -> 22169.67s]  all right let's keep going i forgot that was the cam button
[22169.67s -> 22175.64s]  all right so we also had uh oh it was the person that said they had a
[22175.64s -> 22181.99s]  macro for a while right okay my face is the same color as
[22181.99s -> 22193.67s]  this shirt what are you talking about i don't have it
[22193.67s -> 22197.94s]  orange it's not orange it's just like it's like a little tint of red
[22197.94s -> 22201.93s]  i've been it's hot in here do you know where i live
[22201.93s -> 22218.44s]  like it's cold thank you too uh sad vega though appreciate uh they say uh
[22218.44s -> 22222.44s]  germa i work in it and i can tell you the fn key is very useful for fixing
[22222.44s -> 22228.34s]  people who accidentally turn off their wi-fi
[22228.34s -> 22233.86s]  exactly why it doesn't need to fucking exist
[22233.86s -> 22237.86s]  why would you have a function key to turn off your wi-fi
[22237.86s -> 22244.66s]  just click in the bottom right of your screen and disconnect
[22244.66s -> 22247.70s]  uh and alter their screen when they accidentally press the fn key and
[22247.70s -> 22252.22s]  another key in a combo yeah i don't get it
[22252.22s -> 22256.62s]  you could make every single key 10 larger
[22256.62s -> 22259.66s]  if they was half these keys didn't exist there's so much more key real
[22259.66s -> 22262.38s]  estate your enter key could be bigger your
[22262.38s -> 22266.14s]  spacebar could be longer and larger your alt your control could be
[22266.14s -> 22270.90s]  bigger key you don't need bigger keys sometimes you do
[22270.90s -> 22278.22s]  it's an apple key on on an ipad or whatever whatever
[22278.22s -> 22281.91s]  but thank you uh sad vega appreciate the insight
[22281.91s -> 22284.71s]  door cube thanks for the 250 hey germa thanks for looking at my dumb
[22284.71s -> 22293.50s]  photoshop yesterday and saying wtf honestly it made my day i maybe i did
[22293.50s -> 22304.66s]  i don't remember yesterday i wasn't here yesterday

[22314.62s -> 22318.50s]  appreciate it i'm having fun with the new germa sour emote
[22318.50s -> 22322.34s]  would it be awesome to have some community bt tv emotes enabled too what's
[22322.34s -> 22325.06s]  the point of chatting if i can't use germa wild
[22325.06s -> 22330.70s]  i'm not going to make another 24 hour promise here
[22330.70s -> 22338.79s]  but uh i can't you only have five better tv emotes enabled at once
[22338.79s -> 22341.75s]  do i have to do something else to enable more than 10 of them or 20 of them or
[22341.83s -> 22349.54s]  something how do i do that you can enable your own you can have
[22349.54s -> 22360.70s]  like 20 000 it's five dollars oh okay yeah i'll i'll take a look
[22360.70s -> 22366.30s]  into that particular thing that you talking about
[22366.30s -> 22373.30s]  thank you thank you narcoleptic bear for the thousand bits
[22373.30s -> 22377.70s]  uh appreciate the ten dollars there for when you have to wait out the night
[22377.70s -> 22380.50s]  you should move the lamps away from the windows as the light seeping through
[22380.50s -> 22386.76s]  will attract monsters this is essential for surviving nights later in the game i
[22386.76s -> 22389.50s]  have to now that i'm in a new space tomorrow
[22389.50s -> 22392.30s]  we're gonna really start to move around and we need some french rearrangement
[22392.30s -> 22406.18s]  here people why are people so strange uh
[22406.18s -> 22411.08s]  anyways thank you narcoleptic bear appreciate thank you dino pulse
[22411.08s -> 22415.96s]  zeta for the 500 bits do you think you could eat as much garlic as wario and
[22415.96s -> 22419.00s]  be able to fart as much as him if you wanted to
[22424.57s -> 22431.98s]  i'll tell you wario is way healthier than mario
[22431.98s -> 22449.06s]  wario eats garlic mario eats flowers that burn down his esophagus
[22449.06s -> 22455.00s]  wario only and mushrooms mushrooms and hot sauce
[22455.00s -> 22461.19s]  wario eats garlic and he's got some weight on him so you know that he's
[22461.19s -> 22472.30s]  probably eating some beef wario is 100 muscle shrooms and hot
[22472.30s -> 22479.54s]  sauce yeah that's not a great diet and sometimes cake he gets eats a ton of
[22479.54s -> 22487.14s]  candy and sweets too what else does mario eat mario
[22487.14s -> 22490.66s]  eats spicy food like just hot stuff like hot
[22490.66s -> 22493.48s]  sauce mushrooms but does he eat the mushrooms
[22493.48s -> 22501.00s]  or does it they just like disintegrate into his body
[22501.00s -> 22508.74s]  he eats like bird feathers cherries bird feathers
[22508.74s -> 22517.62s]  that's mario doesn't even even eat food wario at least eats food
[22517.62s -> 22522.18s]  his candy is not really technically it is technically a food
[22522.18s -> 22525.94s]  it's just like sugar but that's like a food group i mean no maybe it's not
[22525.94s -> 22533.11s]  it's not really food is it it's a carbohydrate what is food would
[22533.11s -> 22537.83s]  you break it down to an absolute zero it's just energy sugar is just energy
[22537.83s -> 22542.76s]  so it is you can't get energy out of a bird feather
[22542.76s -> 22553.21s]  luigi doesn't can't eat luigi eats the same stuff as mario
[22553.21s -> 22558.33s]  heat is food yes when you eat something it just gets converted into heat in your
[22558.33s -> 22561.96s]  body and energy and then you burn it then you have to fill
[22561.96s -> 22564.84s]  it again it's just like a bit you're just a gas tank
[22564.84s -> 22574.28s]  i mean that's true yes i mean that but that that's just basic
[22574.28s -> 22579.22s]  basic just raw science i could go into more of that
[22579.22s -> 22588.14s]  everything has energy idiot oh yeah so if i ate uh if i ate the like
[22588.14s -> 22594.01s]  the glass here that i could i would turn that into energy
[22594.01s -> 22600.55s]  i would not i would i would not if i sucked on this piece of plastic
[22600.55s -> 22606.42s]  red air i'm not gonna get any energy from that i can't turn that into heat
[22606.42s -> 22618.94s]  kelvin that's not your name that's the temperature that you use
[22618.94s -> 22632.58s]  prove it yeah kelvin hawkeye of mine thanks for the 800 bits germa you just

[22701.88s -> 22708.39s]  twice and the full moon is out so obviously they wrote peepee and then
[22708.39s -> 22716.23s]  they wrote poopoo with germa sour before each one of them 25 dollars each
[22716.23s -> 22721.34s]  thank you bala koala for the 5 000 bits total
[22721.34s -> 22727.35s]  and your full moon comment uh thank you your

[22741.70s -> 22745.62s]  give 5 000 bits right now they say germa can you wear a collar on stream no
[22745.62s -> 22749.46s]  reason no i'm not going to wear the collar on
[22749.46s -> 22755.46s]  stream that's not gonna happen ever so just you have to accept that
[22755.46s -> 22759.56s]  that's not gonna happen the closest you're gonna get is when i
[22759.56s -> 22762.20s]  put that thing or that little choker thing around
[22762.20s -> 22767.24s]  that's it that's the only image you're gonna ever have
[22767.24s -> 22771.94s]  what are these messages i'm telling you i don't know
[22771.94s -> 22775.14s]  is the we have like a red moon or something we have like a green moon
[22775.14s -> 22786.94s]  tonight but thank you for the thousand bits
[22786.94s -> 22792.28s]  appreciate it gnarly thanks for the 250
[22792.84s -> 22797.24s]  by the way i saw people suggesting you play sc6 after you showed my characters
[22797.24s -> 22800.12s]  on stream i just want to warn you the character
[22800.12s -> 22803.32s]  creator is really restrictive and not really worth it when compared to wwe games
[22803.32s -> 22809.06s]  plus i'd have to play soul caliber which i don't want to do i don't have
[22809.06s -> 22811.70s]  anything against soul caliber i'm just saying i don't
[22811.70s -> 22814.66s]  i don't really want to play soul caliber you don't just make those characters
[22814.66s -> 22818.02s]  and then just don't do anything you have to play soul caliber
[22818.02s -> 22822.04s]  i'd get frustrated you know what would happen i don't even need to tell you
[22822.04s -> 22826.20s]  what would happen i would get shit on twice in a row and
[22826.20s -> 22829.56s]  i would it would piss me off more than anything and i would quit the game
[22829.56s -> 22832.12s]  and it would just be one of those streams or it was like oh he got like
[22832.12s -> 22836.55s]  angry like once every two or three years it'd be that stream
[22836.55s -> 22844.62s]  do cpu versus cpu no i'd still get angry because my guy didn't win
[22844.62s -> 22851.13s]  but yeah uh i didn't really have a plan but
[22851.13s -> 22854.33s]  your uh characters were fucking awesome so

[22912.44s -> 22915.48s]  chime in i'm not sure if this helps but i spent three years not eating onions or
[22915.48s -> 22918.84s]  garlic for health reasons it is annoying for sure if you ever try
[22918.84s -> 22923.00s]  and eat out but some pro tips sushi and home cooking use lots of
[22923.00s -> 22927.40s]  your favorite produce to make up for it like avocado tomato uh really fresh
[22927.40s -> 22930.28s]  tasting stuff hope it all works out i was able to
[22930.28s -> 22933.40s]  tolerate onions again after a few years off of them by the way yeah
[22933.40s -> 22937.64s]  my doctor's not sure of what if that's what it is
[22937.64s -> 22941.08s]  but i have to do this diet for like a while i was supposed to start doing it a
[22941.08s -> 22946.26s]  while ago but going to do the carnival and then twitch
[22946.26s -> 22948.90s]  con you kind of can't it was just it was
[22948.90s -> 22953.14s]  gonna be too hard to start so i'm doing it now the diet is a low
[22953.14s -> 22962.23s]  fod map diet what's wrong with me no there's nothing wrong with me i'm okay
[22962.23s -> 22970.36s]  um yeah thanks for the tips i was making a joke that if i got a bearded dragon
[22970.36s -> 22973.88s]  that i'd have to eat a bunch more of good salad because they eat a shitload
[22973.88s -> 22977.26s]  of greens and healthy food so i was trying to
[22977.26s -> 22981.02s]  really sell this to kim by the way hey let's get a bearded dragon
[22981.02s -> 22984.94s]  and she's like uh i don't know are you sure about that i'm like yeah well we're
[22984.94s -> 22989.86s]  gonna eat more salad because we're gonna buy a bunch of
[22989.86s -> 22993.13s]  salad stuff to feed to the bearded dragon and then
[22993.13s -> 23004.07s]  we have to eat that salad too it's making us healthier did it work
[23004.07s -> 23011.94s]  i'm not sure yet but i want i want one either that or a couple of frogs either
[23011.94s -> 23014.10s]  that or like a like a little gecko or something
[23014.10s -> 23019.74s]  that's that's just fun they're cute plus for the frogs
[23019.74s -> 23022.30s]  there's another thing that i told kim i was like kim you want maybe i'll get a
[23022.30s -> 23025.82s]  couple of tree frogs and she's like oh really what's what do you and i said
[23025.82s -> 23036.17s]  don't worry it's on brand i will see you guys tomorrow wait hold
[23036.17s -> 23043.27s]  on fickle pickle just came in with five dollars 500 bits i saw you out but i was
[23043.27s -> 23049.48s]  too afraid to talk to you because you were watching the lizards get sprayed
[23049.48s -> 23056.34s]  but you were at this pet store that i happened to like stumble across
[23056.34s -> 23060.73s]  i literally saw you looking at the lizards
[23060.73s -> 23077.88s]  no you didn't no way this no way holy shit hey those lizards pretty cool
[23077.88s -> 23086.42s]  he spotted out in the wild at like the lizard store
[23086.42s -> 23092.01s]  that's fucking crazy you didn't even know why didn't you say something
[23092.01s -> 23098.26s]  you should have been like hey those lizards are real cool huh
[23098.26s -> 23106.84s]  hi drama and i would have been like hi how are you
[23106.84s -> 23112.12s]  that's fucking crazy you need to have a secret code
[23112.12s -> 23119.66s]  phrase for fans well uh i actually if you are curious i've been doing my
[23119.66s -> 23124.60s]  research and i have been trying to find places in
[23124.60s -> 23131.64s]  like the vegas area that has lizards and uh amphibians
[23131.64s -> 23136.50s]  so i've been to quite a few places interestingly enough
[23136.50s -> 23143.93s]  kim and i actually went to one yesterday and the day before
[23143.93s -> 23148.39s]  i don't think anyone would call you germa in public except for fans that's
[23148.39s -> 23154.74s]  what i'm saying lizard store meetup why would i ever do
[23154.74s -> 23159.30s]  that that would be so that would be so strange
[23162.04s -> 23165.40s]  but there actually are a couple places believe it or not
[23165.40s -> 23169.74s]  like three or four of them you kind of have to go
[23169.74s -> 23174.49s]  a ways but there are some great stores that have great
[23174.49s -> 23186.62s]  great great great selections can i bring my dragon
[23186.62s -> 23189.90s]  no what guys we're not doing a lizard meetup okay
[23189.90s -> 23196.70s]  the secret phrase is pee pants no just say hi
[23196.70s -> 23203.11s]  germa so i'll immediately know that what's going on every if anybody
[23203.19s -> 23208.07s]  sees me in public and it's it's happened a few times
[23208.07s -> 23211.99s]  it's it's all right you can go home say hi just be like hey what's up man
[23211.99s -> 23215.67s]  germa right and i'll be like yeah what's up how are you
[23215.67s -> 23229.05s]  it's happened a few times it's you don't have to you don't have to hide from me
[23229.05s -> 23237.67s]  you'll have to prove it's you now i'm trying to figure out like
[23237.67s -> 23241.27s]  who you were you know what i mean now i'm trying to figure out
[23241.27s -> 23244.63s]  who were you there you know what i'm saying i'm just like hold on and wait a
[23244.63s -> 23248.66s]  minute i'm scanning my memory like where were
[23248.66s -> 23250.82s]  they which was somebody did somebody look at me
[23250.82s -> 23254.42s]  did somebody look at me and like i made eye contact did it may have
[23254.42s -> 23264.22s]  happened once i don't know i'm trapped that's so weird
[23264.22s -> 23267.82s]  that's i that's so that's so interesting
[23267.82s -> 23277.35s]  say hi next time look i'm going all around to all the lizard stores
[23277.35s -> 23284.06s]  is it weird that knowing that lost people recognize you and don't show it
[23284.14s -> 23291.45s]  i mean i not really i mean i'll be honest with you
[23291.45s -> 23294.89s]  if if i was to go out and somebody was to say something like hey what's up it's
[23294.89s -> 23298.17s]  it's just like i would say hello to anybody anyways it's like oh hey how are
[23298.17s -> 23302.01s]  you good to see you how's school how's life how are you

[23313.66s -> 23317.59s]  it's not like it's odd you know people have conversations with each other all
[23317.59s -> 23320.47s]  the time guys i have conversations with people
[23320.47s -> 23324.06s]  like the coffee shops you know what i mean like somebody will say a sentence
[23324.06s -> 23326.86s]  you're just like yeah yeah yeah but ever do yeah but ever do and they're like
[23326.86s -> 23328.94s]  yeah but ever do you're like yeah but ever do
[23328.94s -> 23340.49s]  and then you just move on with your day right it happens all the time

[23353.56s -> 23360.89s]  much love to you have a fantastic rest of your evening
[23360.89s -> 23372.82s]  maybe i'll end up with a lizard i missed bits by crunchy pickles
[23372.82s -> 23380.07s]  what about a pet snake um four dollars by the way 400 bits
[23380.07s -> 23386.07s]  i here's the thing about snakes snakes are really really really cool
[23386.07s -> 23389.19s]  they're really really interesting and they're so
[23389.19s -> 23397.43s]  cute like a those ball pythons are just adorable i cannot feed a snake a mouse
[23397.43s -> 23411.29s]  i can't couldn't do it that's the bit that's the wall
[23411.29s -> 23415.45s]  and i know that you can get them frozen right but that's just i don't know i
[23415.45s -> 23421.22s]  can't this is too much for me i could feed a bearded dragon bugs
[23421.22s -> 23427.38s]  and k not kale uh like greens and stuff whatever they eat i have to you know
[23427.38s -> 23431.06s]  obviously still do some research if i'm gonna do it or not i could eat a i could
[23431.06s -> 23436.98s]  feed a bearded dragon bugs but not a rat or something no
[23436.98s -> 23446.73s]  i would get attached to the mouse but none of this is set in stone this is all
[23446.73s -> 23450.89s]  just i've been sort of looking at a handful
[23450.89s -> 23456.41s]  of stores in the area like in the vegas area so i've kind of been hopping
[23456.41s -> 23459.05s]  around like do they sell things do they sell things do they sell things do they
[23459.05s -> 23462.28s]  sell things let's get in the car let's go
[23462.36s -> 23466.04s]  so none of this is really set in stone i'm just doing research i don't know
[23466.04s -> 23473.75s]  i'm obviously trying to ask the right questions you're attached to a frozen
[23473.75s -> 23478.12s]  mouse no you you know what i'm saying though it's not
[23478.12s -> 23492.70s]  that simple if you do it you have to get a lizard cam
[23492.70s -> 23503.05s]  don't be it can't be the dragons just hang out and just sit on your shoulder
[23503.05s -> 23508.28s]  aren't they just super chill but they'll poop on you
[23508.28s -> 23514.71s]  that's all right whatever yeah there's a humidity control i've been
[23514.71s -> 23527.32s]  doing a lot of research they just sit around and act dumb i
[23527.32s -> 23530.28s]  don't know it's it's up there in the brain i'm gonna have to this is this is
[23530.28s -> 23534.58s]  a multi-month decision process by the way like i'm not
[23534.58s -> 23537.86s]  gonna turn the stream on tomorrow and there's gonna be a bearded dragon on
[23537.86s -> 23542.10s]  stream like no this is like a multi it's gonna take like months to figure
