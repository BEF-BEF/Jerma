[1.14s -> 3.62s]  Good afternoon, good afternoon, good afternoon. Sorry I'm late, sorry.
[3.62s -> 9.29s]  Something came up last second that I just had to take care of.
[9.29s -> 14.44s]  Care of it? Everything's good? We're ready to go. Sorry I was, uh, late.
[14.44s -> 23.82s]  Sorry. Don't apologize, welcome. Hey, thank you. Hey, look at that.
[23.82s -> 34.92s]  When are we gonna do porn week? Uh, that's every week, man.
[34.92s -> 42.18s]  Keep apologizing. Where is New Vegas? What do you mean New Vegas?
[42.26s -> 46.79s]  Like Fallout New Vegas? Are you trying to tell me to continue a playthrough of a
[46.79s -> 53.59s]  game that I stopped four years ago during my do I like live streaming trial
[53.59s -> 62.04s]  period? Yes. You know, it's kind of funny.
[62.04s -> 68.25s]  If I did that same save file is still here. I could probably open it and I'd be
[68.25s -> 70.65s]  sitting at the door that we were at four years ago.
[70.65s -> 74.17s]  Should I just open it and pretend like it's been not even a day?
[74.17s -> 79.99s]  Okay, so last, uh, last week we were here. Pretty cool adventure so far.
[79.99s -> 83.56s]  I would have no idea where I was even going. I can't do that.
[83.56s -> 88.14s]  But hello, welcome. We're gonna be doing, uh, I did a poll
[88.14s -> 91.82s]  before the stream started. We're gonna be doing Psychic Detective.
[91.82s -> 99.64s]  It is a meaty 3DO game. It is an FMV adventure, from what I understand.
[99.64s -> 106.41s]  I heard it's crazy and you know how much we love our FMV games on this channel.
[106.41s -> 114.34s]  You know it as much as I do. This game is three discs long, which back
[114.34s -> 119.48s]  in the mid-90s, a three to four disc game
[119.56s -> 124.06s]  was like every Lord of the Rings movie back to back.
[124.06s -> 127.10s]  That was a huge amount of stuff. It was insane to know that that was the case.
[127.10s -> 136.44s]  If a game had more than one disc, you knew you were in for it. This is a new mic?
[136.44s -> 144.18s]  No. I'm just sitting a little closer. Look out, Jerma. This could be a porn game.
[144.18s -> 149.24s]  It's not a porn game. It's a detective game. It's not a
[149.24s -> 155.96s]  porn game. Turn your face cam on. Don't have any clothes on?
[155.96s -> 160.90s]  Don't have a face cam. Sorry, guys. Just imagine what I look like right now.
[160.90s -> 170.94s]  There's a couple other games that are FMVs that I cannot wait to play on this
[170.94s -> 179.35s]  ancient dinosaur device of a console. I'm not going to tell you what they are.
[179.35s -> 187.19s]  You'll experience them with me as we do. Psychic porn.
[187.19s -> 192.12s]  All right, let's go. Psychic Detective, welcome everybody.
[192.12s -> 195.72s]  This will be, I do want to say this though, as of today
[195.72s -> 199.88s]  we're going to put a little cool down period on the 3DO in the last three
[199.88s -> 203.69s]  streams in a row. So we're going to put the 3DO away for a
[203.69s -> 207.14s]  week or so. We'll come back to it. It's always here.
[207.14s -> 211.10s]  It's available. We'll do something else this coming week.
[211.10s -> 216.92s]  All right, let's go. Psychic Detective. Oh, by the way, I want to make sure I
[216.92s -> 222.60s]  start saying this more frequently. FTK is not canceled. FTK is going to
[222.60s -> 226.68s]  happen on October 3rd. That is the date for it.
[226.68s -> 234.74s]  October 3rd. I think I mentioned the 26th before, but no, no, no, no, no.
[234.74s -> 241.21s]  October 3rd, 3 p.m. Pacific. It is not canceled.
[241.29s -> 245.42s]  I saw you on my recommended, on my first, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
[245.42s -> 249.02s]  Saw you on my recommended. This is my first stream. Pog.
[249.02s -> 259.22s]  Can we get a warm welcome for Poinster? This is their first stream ever.
[259.22s -> 269.08s]  Phantom. Hey, welcome to your first stream ever.
[269.08s -> 275.83s]  That's the Pog. We, and by the way, we do this for all new viewers.
[275.83s -> 280.82s]  He doesn't know that we do this for everybody. Are you ready for the
[280.82s -> 284.78s]  sing the welcome song? Okay, here we go guys. You know it. You
[284.78s -> 287.50s]  guys know the lyrics. You guys start. You start. You guys do it first.
[287.90s -> 293.40s]  Here we go at the same time. Ready? Hey, I know you're new.
[293.40s -> 298.20s]  Welcome to the stream. Pull up a chair. It's quite the dream.
[298.84s -> 301.56s]  It's your first time here. Oh, what a joy.
[303.16s -> 309.38s]  But don't act like the stream is a toy. You.
[309.38s -> 324.50s]  All right, fuck that. Let's go. No signal.
[324.50s -> 328.18s]  Okay, you know what's really funny? Can I go off? I'm going to go off right now.
[328.18s -> 334.46s]  Do you know how exhausting it would probably be for every new follower or
[334.46s -> 340.10s]  every new subscriber if I had to sing that fucking song?
[340.10s -> 343.46s]  I would look over and they would be a new sub or something. I'd be like,
[343.46s -> 348.97s]  oh wait, there's this 10 new subs. Hey, welcome to the stream.
[348.97s -> 355.03s]  It's just you and I. So he's gone. No, he didn't leave.
[355.03s -> 360.94s]  He actually left. No, he didn't. He's here. You're going to get a personal
[360.94s -> 367.80s]  song sung about you and leave? No, I didn't. He didn't leave.
[367.80s -> 371.24s]  That was a personal directed like welcome song.
[373.37s -> 375.53s]  Actually, that's kind of weird. I probably would fucking leave too.
[375.53s -> 378.76s]  I'd probably leave if I came into a stream and I was like, hey,
[378.76s -> 382.84s]  my first time here and it was like, hey, Germa, welcome to my new stream.
[382.84s -> 385.64s]  You're a new guy. Everybody sing on the side.
[385.64s -> 387.08s]  It'd be like, I'm fucking out of here, man.
[387.08s -> 389.24s]  I just want to relax and just watch TV and eat like french fries.
[389.24s -> 396.23s]  Like, fuck you. Like, stop talking to me.
[396.23s -> 402.39s]  I just want to watch the stream, man. I've so overdone it to this person
[402.39s -> 405.11s]  at this point that now I like they probably I would get back.
[405.11s -> 411.34s]  This is the most overdone new viewer experience.
[413.94s -> 419.16s]  Okay, let's go. It's time for psychic detectives.
[419.16s -> 423.64s]  I have two different drinks here. Does that make me a psycho?
[423.64s -> 435.78s]  Does that make me a weird person? Yes. Movie. Wait, what do you mean movie?
[435.78s -> 452.81s]  Why does it say movie? Is this a movie? No, this is a video game, man.
[452.81s -> 465.45s]  Electronic arts and colossal pictures. It's a fucking nightmare.
[465.45s -> 469.03s]  Psychic powers. The world is yours to control.
[469.03s -> 478.02s]  That's a load of crap. What the hell is going on?
[482.36s -> 483.00s]  I need to turn the...
[483.00s -> 490.25s]  If I could predict the future, there'd be a few less dead bodies.
[492.68s -> 497.61s]  We just got a shot. I need to turn the volume up.
[497.61s -> 503.34s]  There I was, doing what I do best.
[503.34s -> 505.58s]  Look at that hair. That's my hair.
[505.58s -> 509.82s]  The old freak of nature routine. Called myself the psychic flash.
[509.82s -> 513.58s]  Hey, the old folks loved it. Me, I got that.
[513.58s -> 517.66s]  He's so close. Why are you this close to the audience?
[522.31s -> 525.70s]  Your grandfather gave this to you on his deathbed.
[525.70s -> 529.06s]  It's the Joker. It's just the Joker.
[538.44s -> 541.16s]  He's acting like the Joker, too. He's just sitting there staring at me.
[541.16s -> 546.36s]  With one shove, she sent my whole spinning out of control.
[546.36s -> 551.32s]  She showed me how to transmit my psychic self into the consciousness of others.
[551.32s -> 554.44s]  To see through their eyes, hear through their ears.
[554.92s -> 556.84s]  The real mind pirate stuff.
[556.84s -> 557.34s]  What?
[557.64s -> 559.64s]  Naturally, there was a price.
[562.89s -> 564.12s]  What's with the cat?
[564.12s -> 565.88s]  My father just killed himself.
[565.88s -> 566.68s]  Is he psych... What?
[567.48s -> 569.32s]  Is he psychically detecting the cat?
[569.32s -> 578.20s]  He showed me to a family gathering maze and ear.
[578.20s -> 580.36s]  This guy looks like every family feud host.
[583.74s -> 586.38s]  Lady, this is only $400. What the fuck is this?
[596.31s -> 600.73s]  Another special lesson.
[600.73s -> 602.65s]  All right, deal.
[604.68s -> 606.04s]  Ugh. Ugh.
[607.88s -> 612.98s]  What's Black Diamond? Some missing necklace?
[614.54s -> 618.65s]  Just a game. A silly old Russian game.
[619.77s -> 623.54s]  His outfit. He's like a fucking circus ringleader.
[623.54s -> 625.46s]  That's where my father jumped from.
[625.46s -> 626.98s]  What? Why are we here?
[627.70s -> 631.38s]  I tell you, Eric. My father was beaten, disgraced.
[633.06s -> 636.02s]  Too stubborn to give up like that.
[636.82s -> 641.69s]  Wait, we're going in?
[642.73s -> 643.59s]  Where are we?
[644.63s -> 645.96s]  I'm Eric.
[646.84s -> 649.88s]  That's my sister Monica.
[650.44s -> 651.08s]  Where are we?
[652.04s -> 655.00s]  Very cute. Very weak and gullible.
[655.00s -> 656.76s]  Who's the plastic dress?
[656.76s -> 658.20s]  Wait, what do I have to touch?
[658.20s -> 659.00s]  I have to like touch...
[660.04s -> 661.48s]  Maybe you can find out for me.
[662.52s -> 663.96s]  Okay, so...
[663.96s -> 664.46s]  And him?
[667.14s -> 668.90s]  I don't know. My father had a many...
[668.90s -> 671.62s]  Why do I feel like we're at like dinner for schmucks right now?
[671.62s -> 672.66s]  Am I one of the schmucks?
[673.38s -> 676.18s]  If there's money to be made, he smells it.
[676.18s -> 680.47s]  Keep an eye on him and Monica.
[680.47s -> 681.19s]  Where will you be?
[681.75s -> 682.31s]  What?
[682.31s -> 685.14s]  Me? You don't have to worry about me.
[685.14s -> 687.22s]  Okay, we've got people to talk to?
[687.86s -> 690.17s]  All right, come on.
[690.17s -> 691.85s]  Are you a friend of Garelia?
[691.85s -> 692.89s]  No, I want to talk to...
[692.89s -> 693.85s]  We're going to Moki.
[694.89s -> 703.83s]  I just... I totally just told her I gotta fuck off.
[703.83s -> 704.33s]  Uh-oh.
[705.50s -> 707.42s]  This is the scariest lady ever.
[707.42s -> 708.06s]  What was that?
[715.45s -> 717.05s]  Why are we in this scary house?
[717.85s -> 725.31s]  Okay, we'll...
[725.31s -> 733.95s]  Oh, we're inside of his head.
[735.95s -> 738.11s]  We're inside of Moki's head.
[752.91s -> 753.41s]  Brass ring.
[754.27s -> 758.30s]  Okay, we're looking for a brass ring.
[758.30s -> 759.10s]  Should I just stay in...
[759.10s -> 761.18s]  Okay, what if I stay in this guy forever?
[765.52s -> 767.36s]  Isn't that sweet?
[767.36s -> 768.48s]  You put it in the shredder, man.
[768.48s -> 769.84s]  You don't have to just rip it up in three pieces.
[771.23s -> 772.43s]  Who... What are we looking for?
[775.84s -> 779.34s]  Why are we in this guy's head?
[781.20s -> 784.00s]  We're just sitting there watching a movie.
[784.00s -> 785.36s]  Yeah, that's us down there, right?
[788.84s -> 791.24s]  You think you'd puke if you saw yourself walking down the stairs
[791.24s -> 792.84s]  and looked over at yourself, looking at yourself?
[792.84s -> 794.44s]  I would fucking puke right now.
[798.19s -> 798.67s]  Monica.
[798.67s -> 799.71s]  You should talk to Max.
[799.71s -> 804.46s]  Max sent me a check and the authority to give you
[804.46s -> 806.62s]  whatever kind of advance you'd like.
[806.62s -> 807.02s]  Oh, okay.
[808.06s -> 813.52s]  The donation of the Vladimir Pozzak collection to Mirage Quest.
[814.24s -> 815.77s]  Oh, back to Moki.
[815.77s -> 817.29s]  No, I don't have an option.
[818.25s -> 820.41s]  I have to be like within laser eye distance of them.
[822.06s -> 822.70s]  Oh, in my head.
[824.11s -> 826.36s]  Wait, this is what I see.
[829.20s -> 829.68s]  Cigar.
[834.62s -> 835.10s]  What am I...
[835.10s -> 836.54s]  I'm smoking somebody's cigar?
[837.26s -> 843.63s]  I must ask you to go.
[844.43s -> 846.19s]  Your uncle was a big noise.
[846.19s -> 847.79s]  A real player in the old country.
[848.96s -> 850.24s]  Paranormal espionage.
[850.24s -> 851.04s]  Did I just get kicked out?
[851.04s -> 852.16s]  That's all I'm allowed to say.
[852.48s -> 855.92s]  But perhaps you would be interested in a little collectible.
[855.92s -> 856.72s]  Oh, that's what I need.
[856.72s -> 857.52s]  I want that watch.
[858.40s -> 859.20s]  He's shameless.
[860.00s -> 860.88s]  His hands.
[860.88s -> 862.08s]  He's got like three hands.
[864.09s -> 864.41s]  Chad.
[865.13s -> 866.17s]  Oh, what's Chad up to?
[866.81s -> 873.53s]  Oh, wait.
[873.53s -> 874.17s]  This is the money.
[875.74s -> 876.54s]  Chad's got the money.
[877.10s -> 877.90s]  Are we Chad?
[877.90s -> 878.30s]  I don't know.
[878.30s -> 878.94s]  I don't understand.
[887.85s -> 888.65s]  What is all this shit?
[888.65s -> 889.93s]  This is like an incantation?
[889.93s -> 890.65s]  Hi there.
[893.71s -> 896.03s]  What is going on in this house?
[896.03s -> 896.67s]  What'd you find?
[896.67s -> 898.03s]  This is the most fucked up house ever.
[898.03s -> 899.55s]  Just a little notebook.
[899.55s -> 902.16s]  This is just improv class the house.
[902.72s -> 904.67s]  Okay, you got to walk into a room.
[904.67s -> 906.11s]  And now give me an object.
[906.11s -> 906.75s]  The book.
[906.75s -> 907.07s]  Okay.
[907.07s -> 916.97s]  And then she we're back in Eric's head.
[920.19s -> 920.83s]  Big knife.
[921.39s -> 924.88s]  We don't know that.
[924.88s -> 926.96s]  No, you have your chance.
[927.76s -> 930.64s]  I don't have any idea what the fuck is going on.
[930.64s -> 932.24s]  How do we make you sing?
[932.24s -> 932.74s]  Jesus.
[938.16s -> 938.96s]  Wait, wait.
[938.96s -> 939.84s]  A knife.
[939.84s -> 940.34s]  Knife.
[940.72s -> 941.44s]  Pick up the knife.
[941.44s -> 942.80s]  I had one second to look at that.
[942.80s -> 944.80s]  Take a genius to play it out.
[944.80s -> 946.08s]  I was coming down.
[946.08s -> 947.36s]  She was going up.
[947.36s -> 949.60s]  The door prize was a hunk of blood pudding.
[950.64s -> 951.44s]  I didn't I'll go away.
[951.44s -> 952.32s]  I didn't touch anything.
[953.12s -> 957.82s]  What happened?
[958.54s -> 959.58s]  Chad sort of made a mess.
[960.14s -> 961.02s]  Chad made a mess.
[962.22s -> 964.44s]  Are we leaving?
[965.00s -> 966.68s]  Please insert disc two.
[970.86s -> 972.62s]  Okay, let's go ahead.
[972.62s -> 973.82s]  I'm going to put in disc.
[973.82s -> 975.26s]  That was a quick.
[975.26s -> 976.30s]  That was very fast.
[976.94s -> 978.22s]  So what have we gathered so far?
[978.78s -> 979.28s]  Hold on.
[983.60s -> 984.56s]  40 minutes or so.
[984.56s -> 985.44s]  Where the fuck are they?
[986.32s -> 987.12s]  Where are these discs?
[988.00s -> 990.72s]  All right.
[990.72s -> 991.44s]  What have we gathered?
[993.39s -> 994.59s]  So far we've gathered that
[996.35s -> 997.87s]  there's a guy.
[997.87s -> 999.39s]  Somebody jumped out of a window.
[1000.19s -> 1002.51s]  And then we all went to a dinner party at their house
[1003.07s -> 1006.43s]  to find out who did it or something.
[1006.43s -> 1009.69s]  And then somebody gets stabbed.
[1009.69s -> 1010.73s]  There's a ring.
[1010.73s -> 1011.45s]  There's a watch.
[1013.53s -> 1013.93s]  You know what?
[1013.93s -> 1014.97s]  I have no idea.
[1014.97s -> 1017.53s]  So just I'm going to put disc two in.
[1017.53s -> 1020.48s]  We're going to see what happens.
[1020.48s -> 1022.48s]  I don't think can I even get into disc two?
[1022.48s -> 1023.28s]  There we go.
[1023.36s -> 1024.56s]  I don't have to press a button.
[1025.20s -> 1027.84s]  The game has.
[1027.84s -> 1028.16s]  Yeah.
[1028.16s -> 1029.84s]  I don't understand what you went through.
[1029.84s -> 1032.56s]  All the FMVs that are available in one disc.
[1032.56s -> 1034.83s]  That seems a little ridiculous.
[1037.79s -> 1039.71s]  12 video files on each disc.
[1041.24s -> 1041.48s]  All right.
[1041.48s -> 1042.52s]  Let's continue the story.
[1043.74s -> 1045.42s]  A meaty 3DO game.
[1045.42s -> 1045.74s]  Yeah.
[1045.74s -> 1048.94s]  Or like this is AI dungeon.
[1048.94s -> 1049.90s]  Shot for shot.
[1049.90s -> 1052.78s]  What happens next?
[1064.49s -> 1065.29s]  Crops got involved.
[1066.33s -> 1069.37s]  From the puka lounge to multiple stab wound city.
[1069.93s -> 1071.21s]  Courtesy of my libido.
[1072.17s -> 1073.61s]  I made a mental note.
[1073.61s -> 1076.73s]  From now on only do you brunch with these people.
[1076.73s -> 1080.30s]  You sure it was her?
[1080.94s -> 1081.18s]  Yeah.
[1081.18s -> 1082.86s]  Like I had a front row seat.
[1082.86s -> 1083.82s]  But why Chad?
[1084.80s -> 1086.16s]  Your father keep a green notebook?
[1087.63s -> 1087.95s]  Yeah.
[1088.59s -> 1089.71s]  Any idea what was in it?
[1090.67s -> 1091.63s]  Not really.
[1091.63s -> 1092.91s]  Don't play with me, Lena.
[1092.91s -> 1093.47s]  I don't know.
[1094.80s -> 1095.36s]  His big secret.
[1095.36s -> 1097.20s]  I feel like I skipped to the middle of the movie.
[1098.30s -> 1100.70s]  I think Chad was going to sell it to the weasel.
[1100.70s -> 1101.98s]  The Sylvia chick had other ideas.
[1101.98s -> 1103.90s]  Did we accidentally do the right outcome?
[1103.90s -> 1108.06s]  Eric, you're better than I could have hoped for.
[1108.06s -> 1109.71s]  Okay, here we go.
[1109.71s -> 1110.51s]  So are we good night?
[1111.63s -> 1112.27s]  Give me those keys.
[1112.99s -> 1120.00s]  I just wanted to take the keys, man.
[1120.56s -> 1122.76s]  I just wanted to take the keys.
[1123.32s -> 1128.08s]  Hiding somebody.
[1130.12s -> 1131.00s]  Shut up.
[1131.00s -> 1132.00s]  Who is he?
[1134.91s -> 1135.55s]  Sergey.
[1136.64s -> 1137.84s]  And Sergey is.
[1139.55s -> 1140.51s]  Not my lover.
[1140.51s -> 1141.55s]  Not my plaything.
[1142.43s -> 1145.40s]  Just a poor defenseless man.
[1147.98s -> 1148.70s]  Did I lose?
[1148.70s -> 1149.66s]  Did I touch the keys?
[1151.56s -> 1152.92s]  Poor defenseless man.
[1153.88s -> 1155.12s]  So how-
[1155.12s -> 1156.32s]  All right, we're gonna follow her.
[1166.49s -> 1169.05s]  I have trouble doing exactly what I'm told.
[1169.05s -> 1170.49s]  And I hate being lied to.
[1171.21s -> 1173.69s]  Okay, she was going to bite my head off.
[1173.69s -> 1174.49s]  Now what?
[1174.49s -> 1175.85s]  But that's better than getting it blown.
[1175.85s -> 1176.65s]  I'm really close.
[1176.65s -> 1178.41s]  Did you notice I'm just following her?
[1178.41s -> 1179.29s]  Did she not look?
[1179.29s -> 1180.41s]  She doesn't know I'm behind her.
[1181.05s -> 1182.41s]  She has no idea that I followed her.
[1183.13s -> 1189.40s]  Okay, that was way easier than it even seems to be in like GTA.
[1190.20s -> 1190.84s]  Knock on the door.
[1197.02s -> 1198.22s]  Don't look so surprised.
[1198.70s -> 1201.47s]  I mean, I followed you all the fucking way here.
[1206.78s -> 1207.82s]  Are you satisfied?
[1208.46s -> 1210.30s]  Did you find all the dirty truth you have?
[1210.30s -> 1210.86s]  That puppet.
[1211.50s -> 1212.94s]  Let's touch the puppet and see what happened.
[1213.98s -> 1222.01s]  Kiki dance.
[1222.01s -> 1223.29s]  Kiki dance.
[1223.29s -> 1224.17s]  Who did this to him?
[1224.17s -> 1225.05s]  What?
[1225.05s -> 1226.88s]  Well, who do you think?
[1227.60s -> 1229.52s]  The great Vladimir.
[1229.52s -> 1230.48s]  How could he?
[1230.48s -> 1233.85s]  Oh, he was so pleased with himself.
[1233.85s -> 1237.05s]  Such an elegant solution to such a messy situation.
[1238.17s -> 1239.13s]  The two of you-
[1239.13s -> 1240.01s]  What did she say?
[1240.01s -> 1241.13s]  Vladimir?
[1241.21s -> 1241.77s]  Oh, please.
[1243.77s -> 1244.81s]  Wait, I can go with somebody.
[1244.81s -> 1245.53s]  Let's go in her head.
[1246.33s -> 1263.64s]  Why is that so funny?
[1264.44s -> 1267.56s]  I guess you have gerbils that are running on a wheel.
[1267.56s -> 1269.08s]  I guess it's hilarious.
[1269.08s -> 1277.39s]  What the hell is going on?
[1286.91s -> 1287.47s]  Can't we help him?
[1287.47s -> 1288.03s]  Is he dead?
[1288.83s -> 1292.19s]  Did I just like psychic him to death?
[1296.99s -> 1298.91s]  Isn't that the thing that they keep the bingo balls in?
[1298.91s -> 1299.87s]  We need all four.
[1302.06s -> 1304.30s]  And you think I can find the other three?
[1306.01s -> 1306.73s]  I just hope you're ready.
[1306.73s -> 1309.05s]  I need to find four of these magic cylinders.
[1311.92s -> 1314.00s]  At least we have the actual thing we need to do for the game.
[1323.50s -> 1325.53s]  Don't do it.
[1325.53s -> 1326.01s]  Wait, it's-
[1326.57s -> 1333.56s]  Okay, that's-
[1335.24s -> 1335.48s]  That's-
[1335.48s -> 1336.28s]  It's improv.
[1336.28s -> 1336.84s]  It's improv.
[1336.84s -> 1337.88s]  It's improv.
[1338.60s -> 1339.56s]  It's improv.
[1339.56s -> 1340.28s]  It wasn't anything.
[1341.88s -> 1342.28s]  Oh, shit.
[1342.28s -> 1342.76s]  Where do I go?
[1345.05s -> 1346.25s]  Oh, in Max's head.
[1346.25s -> 1348.97s]  There's a little hot shot inside my head.
[1348.97s -> 1350.25s]  Eric Fox.
[1350.25s -> 1351.69s]  That name means nothing to me.
[1353.13s -> 1354.89s]  He's leaving fingerprints all over my mind.
[1354.89s -> 1356.09s]  I just changed the channel.
[1356.09s -> 1356.73s]  How can you tell?
[1357.45s -> 1359.05s]  You'd never understand.
[1359.05s -> 1359.55s]  Hey!
[1360.17s -> 1362.01s]  I'm not all tricked out and psychic,
[1362.01s -> 1364.09s]  but I'm damn good at what I do.
[1364.09s -> 1365.05s]  Smoked you out.
[1365.69s -> 1367.61s]  Maximum sub bonabim.
[1368.49s -> 1369.05s]  What about Eric?
[1369.85s -> 1373.34s]  I'm going to squash you like a sow bug.
[1376.19s -> 1376.91s]  What happened?
[1378.03s -> 1378.91s]  Aggression.
[1378.91s -> 1379.63s]  You just spat me out.
[1380.43s -> 1382.40s]  You can use it.
[1382.40s -> 1383.68s]  You can read me.
[1383.68s -> 1385.20s]  You can read all of us.
[1385.20s -> 1386.64s]  You can go anywhere.
[1386.64s -> 1388.32s]  Oh, you little innocent boy.
[1388.32s -> 1389.28s]  It was mine.
[1389.28s -> 1390.56s]  He gave it to me.
[1391.44s -> 1392.32s]  Are those stink lines?
[1392.32s -> 1393.76s]  Is she like smelling my body?
[1394.40s -> 1402.27s]  You did that.
[1402.27s -> 1402.59s]  Wait.
[1402.59s -> 1404.91s]  A dad just made her be aggressive.
[1405.55s -> 1411.60s]  But I think maybe you deserve it.
[1411.60s -> 1412.10s]  What?
[1412.48s -> 1415.18s]  There is a chance to spy, to go anywhere.
[1415.18s -> 1416.86s]  Read Psych-lana.
[1424.70s -> 1424.94s]  Wait.
[1424.94s -> 1425.66s]  Did I just?
[1425.66s -> 1425.98s]  Did I?
[1426.78s -> 1431.87s]  This guy.
[1435.64s -> 1436.84s]  Who the fuck is this?
[1442.06s -> 1443.18s]  He's not even here anymore.
[1445.12s -> 1445.92s]  Did that even happen?
[1446.64s -> 1451.12s]  You're under arrest for the murder of Sergian Olsenko and Chad Zatowski.
[1451.12s -> 1453.44s]  You have the right to remain silent.
[1453.44s -> 1455.36s]  You have the right to an attorney.
[1455.36s -> 1456.48s]  Anything you say can.
[1456.48s -> 1458.16s]  How many times are they going to put cuffs on me?
[1459.20s -> 1460.64s]  That was like five different cuffs.
[1466.41s -> 1467.61s]  So you like to read me?
[1467.61s -> 1468.73s]  What were you doing in the house?
[1468.73s -> 1469.61s]  Did you get the knife?
[1469.61s -> 1470.89s]  Like to cough turkey?
[1470.89s -> 1471.21s]  Sure.
[1471.21s -> 1472.01s]  Every Christmas.
[1472.01s -> 1473.69s]  You did a real number on Chad.
[1473.69s -> 1475.05s]  Not much darker meat was it?
[1475.05s -> 1475.85s]  I know who did it.
[1476.57s -> 1478.57s]  It was that chick who runs the tea room, Sylvia.
[1479.93s -> 1481.61s]  She killed him over a notebook.
[1481.61s -> 1482.65s]  Can you believe that?
[1482.65s -> 1483.29s]  You saw her?
[1483.85s -> 1484.81s]  These guys are touching.
[1485.77s -> 1486.97s]  How small is this room?
[1486.97s -> 1488.25s]  Is this an airplane bathroom?
[1488.25s -> 1489.45s]  He was nailed.
[1489.45s -> 1490.97s]  He was a fall guy.
[1490.97s -> 1495.56s]  He was going to jail.
[1495.56s -> 1496.36s]  Oh my god.
[1497.40s -> 1498.68s]  I guess we're going on to...
[1499.40s -> 1500.20s]  There is no losing.
[1503.28s -> 1506.56s]  We're moving on to the final chapter of the game.
[1515.95s -> 1517.15s]  This is like a roguelike.
[1517.15s -> 1518.03s]  I could just do it again.
[1523.84s -> 1524.56s]  Let me get this right.
[1524.56s -> 1526.72s]  So we didn't catch the killer.
[1526.72s -> 1528.09s]  That's what you have to do.
[1528.09s -> 1529.29s]  We caught it the first time.
[1529.85s -> 1535.50s]  But when that guy walked in with like two bleeding breasts,
[1535.50s -> 1538.03s]  we have no idea what happened to him.
[1538.03s -> 1539.31s]  And the guy had a gun.
[1539.31s -> 1541.08s]  We didn't catch it.
[1541.08s -> 1544.19s]  Well, let's see what happens.
[1544.19s -> 1556.48s]  You know, I'm going to keep these discs at the ready.
[1556.48s -> 1563.34s]  They need to be available.
[1563.34s -> 1565.82s]  Main character looks unreasonably sweaty.
[1565.82s -> 1569.04s]  I mean, yeah.
[1569.04s -> 1570.72s]  All right, we're in jail.
[1571.28s -> 1574.68s]  It's like I'm standing still.
[1577.16s -> 1577.88s]  Shit, I missed enough.
[1580.68s -> 1581.72s]  I could have gone in that guy's head.
[1588.20s -> 1589.16s]  Too weird to lie.
[1591.02s -> 1592.78s]  Detective, could you take that outside?
[1592.78s -> 1595.18s]  Detective, can you please not like light your nose on fire?
[1596.76s -> 1600.35s]  Why are you holding a lighter up to your eyebrows?
[1600.35s -> 1601.71s]  That's kind of strange.
[1601.71s -> 1608.35s]  We're going to go courier.
[1610.96s -> 1612.08s]  Holy shit, dude.
[1612.72s -> 1625.93s]  He drove like a type A wired on coffee and stressed to the max.
[1625.93s -> 1626.65s]  Come on.
[1626.65s -> 1627.05s]  Come on.
[1627.05s -> 1627.69s]  Come on.
[1627.69s -> 1628.09s]  Huh?
[1628.09s -> 1629.21s]  Jesus.
[1629.21s -> 1630.25s]  Yak, yak, yak.
[1631.29s -> 1633.61s]  He cursed the world, cut off everybody,
[1633.61s -> 1636.25s]  and had this false chipper voice for customers.
[1636.33s -> 1636.89s]  All righty.
[1636.89s -> 1638.33s]  Just sign right there on the Dipsy Doodle.
[1640.33s -> 1641.37s]  All of us are working.
[1641.37s -> 1643.13s]  Can we do the speed limit, please?
[1643.13s -> 1643.77s]  Excuse me.
[1644.57s -> 1645.45s]  Hello.
[1645.45s -> 1646.25s]  You're bigger than me.
[1646.25s -> 1646.73s]  Not much.
[1646.73s -> 1647.53s]  You're bigger than me.
[1647.53s -> 1648.89s]  A deeply disturbed head.
[1648.89s -> 1649.61s]  We all do this.
[1649.61s -> 1651.05s]  The psychic detectives can't be choosers.
[1651.05s -> 1651.53s]  I do this.
[1651.53s -> 1655.64s]  Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, please.
[1655.64s -> 1656.84s]  Not that, but I do the sounds.
[1656.84s -> 1657.80s]  Those noises, I do.
[1658.52s -> 1663.50s]  All right, what's in the package?
[1667.13s -> 1667.69s]  So nice.
[1667.69s -> 1669.13s]  He's got all the...
[1669.13s -> 1670.17s]  All right, we're going to Bagman.
[1672.40s -> 1673.52s]  Courier's walking by.
[1673.52s -> 1681.92s]  I'm Bagman now.
[1682.00s -> 1682.48s]  I just...
[1682.48s -> 1683.68s]  Get a life, dirtbag.
[1686.33s -> 1688.49s]  Wait, I can just jump into his head to laugh at him?
[1689.37s -> 1690.81s]  The rest became a blur.
[1691.77s -> 1693.45s]  What was the point of being able to jump into him?
[1693.45s -> 1694.49s]  Green light, green light.
[1694.49s -> 1697.61s]  He whistled at women and ate bags of pork rinds.
[1697.61s -> 1699.61s]  I couldn't stand it much longer.
[1699.61s -> 1701.29s]  Even jail was sounding better than...
[1703.18s -> 1705.50s]  Hey, somebody likes your hot shots.
[1705.50s -> 1706.54s]  He just pulled me out of that.
[1708.68s -> 1709.56s]  Sorry we kept you, kid.
[1709.56s -> 1710.52s]  Why is he in jail with me?
[1711.32s -> 1717.71s]  Oh, why is everybody in...
[1717.71s -> 1719.23s]  Why is she in prison?
[1721.02s -> 1722.54s]  Even the receptionist was in prison.
[1723.10s -> 1731.74s]  I think we should see how the old woman is doing.
[1731.74s -> 1732.78s]  What do you think?
[1732.78s -> 1734.38s]  I think we forget about her.
[1734.38s -> 1735.68s]  Who the kid?
[1735.68s -> 1736.88s]  Papa Vladimir?
[1736.88s -> 1738.16s]  He hid the fourth collector.
[1739.52s -> 1741.60s]  Am I going to have to put up on disc three?
[1742.64s -> 1743.28s]  How could you?
[1745.08s -> 1748.78s]  Eric, you are a genius.
[1749.58s -> 1750.14s]  I know.
[1750.70s -> 1752.99s]  Okay, here's where the...
[1752.99s -> 1753.87s]  Oh, there's Bagman.
[1754.67s -> 1756.01s]  Is it active?
[1756.01s -> 1756.65s]  Can you tell?
[1757.69s -> 1758.49s]  Barely.
[1758.49s -> 1760.48s]  But no tricks.
[1760.48s -> 1761.28s]  Just get it for me.
[1761.28s -> 1762.80s]  Can't go into Bagman again.
[1762.80s -> 1763.44s]  That's unfair.
[1773.16s -> 1774.20s]  Holy shit.
[1774.92s -> 1775.40s]  Okay.
[1781.36s -> 1786.60s]  But you're a fine looking couple.
[1786.60s -> 1787.40s]  You know, I tell you,
[1787.40s -> 1790.12s]  I get some butt ugly people in here sometimes.
[1790.12s -> 1791.48s]  It's a pleasure just to look at you.
[1791.48s -> 1792.76s]  Let me just look at you.
[1793.40s -> 1796.60s]  Can I see that metal crystal beer mug?
[1796.60s -> 1797.88s]  Oh, we get...
[1797.88s -> 1799.24s]  You can have it.
[1799.24s -> 1801.24s]  Some old bitch brought it in, I tell you.
[1801.24s -> 1803.16s]  You guys are a lot more fun than she was.
[1803.16s -> 1803.80s]  Two out of four.
[1804.92s -> 1805.68s]  Have a nice day.
[1805.68s -> 1806.32s]  Who's that easy?
[1806.32s -> 1807.04s]  Have a nice day.
[1810.14s -> 1811.34s]  Why would you say that?
[1811.34s -> 1812.46s]  Hey, do you want to get to hold it?
[1814.62s -> 1815.42s]  Can I hold it?
[1815.42s -> 1815.98s]  We don't need...
[1815.98s -> 1817.10s]  It's not like a dog
[1817.10s -> 1818.86s]  that you just got out of the pet store.
[1818.86s -> 1819.58s]  We can do this.
[1819.58s -> 1819.98s]  No, come on.
[1819.98s -> 1820.46s]  Let me hold him.
[1824.99s -> 1833.52s]  Okay, good.
[1833.52s -> 1834.08s]  Now we got...
[1835.36s -> 1836.48s]  Find them.
[1836.48s -> 1837.60s]  Tell me what they're doing.
[1837.60s -> 1838.16s]  Madame T.
[1839.84s -> 1840.88s]  Idiot.
[1840.88s -> 1842.54s]  You take too long.
[1843.42s -> 1845.63s]  Have your only hope.
[1846.67s -> 1847.71s]  She's talking to herself
[1847.71s -> 1848.91s]  but she know we're in her head.
[1848.91s -> 1849.95s]  What did you learn?
[1849.95s -> 1851.90s]  With your lady's steam.
[1851.90s -> 1853.10s]  What old lady?
[1853.18s -> 1854.78s]  Old lady's a pain in the key store.
[1856.96s -> 1857.52s]  Fine.
[1857.52s -> 1859.44s]  We'll give her the precious student.
[1859.44s -> 1860.80s]  Okay, so we're gonna go see the old lady.
[1863.71s -> 1864.03s]  Wait.
[1865.10s -> 1866.62s]  There's something I want to try.
[1867.84s -> 1869.04s]  We only need two more of these.
[1869.68s -> 1870.80s]  What are you trying?
[1870.80s -> 1871.28s]  Papa.
[1872.59s -> 1873.07s]  Triangles.
[1880.75s -> 1886.70s]  What is going...
[1886.70s -> 1887.26s]  What's he doing?
[1889.16s -> 1890.28s]  It was Max.
[1890.28s -> 1891.00s]  He was here.
[1891.00s -> 1891.64s]  Walk pattern.
[1892.28s -> 1896.56s]  It was Bugleberry.
[1896.56s -> 1897.92s]  It was Bugleberry
[1897.92s -> 1898.72s]  laughing at somebody
[1898.72s -> 1900.24s]  how bad they hated the new carpet
[1900.24s -> 1901.04s]  that just got delivered.
[1901.68s -> 1906.27s]  What the fuck am I doing?
[1906.83s -> 1913.61s]  It was already open.
[1913.61s -> 1915.05s]  It was clearly already open.
[1919.68s -> 1920.00s]  Case.
[1931.32s -> 1931.88s]  Okay.
[1931.88s -> 1932.36s]  Shards.
[1933.24s -> 1933.80s]  Workbench.
[1934.68s -> 1935.32s]  Let's get the pin.
[1944.51s -> 1944.75s]  Okay.
[1944.75s -> 1946.19s]  What's with the flashing lights by the way?
[1946.75s -> 1948.19s]  Where are we?
[1949.82s -> 1950.30s]  Shards.
[1953.26s -> 1956.56s]  Wait, he just broke one.
[1957.28s -> 1962.32s]  One of the spirits?
[1962.88s -> 1965.87s]  Or was it open...
[1965.87s -> 1966.43s]  Workbench.
[1983.56s -> 1984.12s]  Okay.
[1984.12s -> 1984.44s]  No.
[1984.44s -> 1985.64s]  Go to Madame T.
[1987.48s -> 1988.84s]  We go to Madame T?
[1989.40s -> 1993.45s]  Lexi killed your dad.
[1994.32s -> 1995.20s]  Lexi?
[1995.20s -> 1996.16s]  Lexi, Max.
[1996.16s -> 1997.28s]  Same asshole.
[1997.28s -> 2002.43s]  How do you know?
[2002.43s -> 2004.03s]  Why do you think I touched him?
[2004.03s -> 2005.15s]  To sniff my fingers?
[2006.99s -> 2008.75s]  What a weird thing to go to first.
[2008.75s -> 2009.47s]  I'm sorry.
[2010.35s -> 2011.31s]  He was here.
[2011.31s -> 2012.67s]  He wanted the fourth collector.
[2013.63s -> 2015.32s]  And he torched the hell out of Vladimir.
[2019.34s -> 2020.35s]  Uh-oh.
[2020.35s -> 2020.91s]  Madame T.
[2022.27s -> 2024.00s]  We're too late.
[2031.68s -> 2032.64s]  Just for me, Eric.
[2033.44s -> 2034.56s]  Make her...
[2034.56s -> 2035.72s]  ...wist.
[2035.72s -> 2036.22s]  No.
[2044.28s -> 2045.96s]  Hello on the old lady's face.
[2046.99s -> 2047.39s]  Oh.
[2047.39s -> 2048.67s]  Find what you can.
[2048.67s -> 2049.31s]  Find what I can.
[2049.31s -> 2050.59s]  Rip her to pieces.
[2050.59s -> 2055.24s]  Feed her or fry her.
[2055.24s -> 2057.72s]  You think you can use me?
[2058.84s -> 2059.72s]  Bend me?
[2060.60s -> 2061.72s]  For practice?
[2062.97s -> 2064.17s]  Get out!
[2064.17s -> 2064.89s]  Oh shit.
[2064.89s -> 2065.37s]  We blew it.
[2083.63s -> 2085.95s]  Get out before I take a turn.
[2086.59s -> 2088.99s]  You tell your next mirage.
[2088.99s -> 2090.11s]  We are ready.
[2092.59s -> 2093.79s]  Didn't she kill the person?
[2094.51s -> 2096.99s]  Anybody tried to talk to Moki lately?
[2097.79s -> 2098.59s]  What is Moki?
[2098.59s -> 2099.09s]  Uh-oh.
[2100.89s -> 2101.39s]  Uh-oh.
[2114.72s -> 2115.68s]  What is this game board?
[2119.77s -> 2120.81s]  Did we just get three?
[2121.53s -> 2122.49s]  We got a third one?
[2129.10s -> 2129.98s]  What in the name?
[2131.58s -> 2134.14s]  This is no game of checkers and pieces.
[2134.78s -> 2137.10s]  You must pick thoughts, Eric.
[2137.10s -> 2137.60s]  Go on.
[2139.02s -> 2139.42s]  This kind of...
[2139.42s -> 2140.62s]  The guy kind of looks like my dad.
[2140.62s -> 2141.50s]  So I'm just gonna pick him.
[2146.56s -> 2147.36s]  How about the skull?
[2148.16s -> 2148.66s]  Cigarette.
[2155.60s -> 2156.10s]  A shoe.
[2158.14s -> 2160.46s]  Yes, always pick the shoe.
[2161.34s -> 2163.02s]  Vladimir, he loved the shoe.
[2163.58s -> 2166.24s]  Always the shoe.
[2166.96s -> 2167.52s]  How about...
[2167.52s -> 2168.40s]  And you?
[2169.04s -> 2175.77s]  As long as I am alive.
[2175.77s -> 2176.27s]  Cool.
[2178.12s -> 2179.96s]  She's playing her pieces now.
[2179.96s -> 2181.55s]  Is this like auto chess?
[2181.55s -> 2182.19s]  Are they gonna fight?
[2182.75s -> 2183.47s]  I don't understand this.
[2183.47s -> 2184.67s]  You move first.
[2184.67s -> 2186.99s]  That is what this is.
[2187.79s -> 2189.95s]  I attack the shoe.
[2193.53s -> 2196.01s]  I'm gonna use the shoe to attack this person.
[2197.28s -> 2197.76s]  Got it.
[2197.76s -> 2198.64s]  They are the same.
[2199.28s -> 2201.68s]  Nobody wins till the next move.
[2201.68s -> 2203.12s]  Too bad for you.
[2203.12s -> 2205.07s]  It's my turn.
[2205.07s -> 2205.87s]  Okay.
[2205.87s -> 2208.11s]  So you're gonna go with lady versus dad.
[2208.11s -> 2208.91s]  You kill dad.
[2208.91s -> 2209.95s]  We take turns.
[2210.51s -> 2212.60s]  One of us will lose everything.
[2212.60s -> 2213.88s]  You understand?
[2213.88s -> 2216.60s]  Kill him.
[2216.60s -> 2220.16s]  Brat bastard, to be my laptop.
[2220.16s -> 2221.12s]  So what?
[2223.04s -> 2224.00s]  Own the fear.
[2224.00s -> 2224.80s]  Find the scar.
[2224.80s -> 2225.76s]  Free the girl.
[2225.76s -> 2226.88s]  Steal the kiss.
[2226.88s -> 2228.32s]  You're a little cocky.
[2228.32s -> 2228.82s]  I think.
[2229.60s -> 2230.32s]  Hi, noon babe.
[2230.32s -> 2231.04s]  Big showdown.
[2231.68s -> 2233.76s]  Eric, I don't think you realize.
[2233.76s -> 2234.48s]  What?
[2234.48s -> 2236.14s]  That I could walk away a fritter?
[2236.14s -> 2237.66s]  That I'm insane to do this?
[2237.66s -> 2238.54s]  What don't I realize?
[2238.54s -> 2243.02s]  Andy Samberg and original Luke Skywalker Mark Hamill got fused together.
[2243.02s -> 2244.06s]  Light a fire.
[2244.86s -> 2251.07s]  That really got me rocking.
[2251.07s -> 2257.02s]  I still have no idea what's going on.
[2258.30s -> 2260.54s]  So we now have to do her bidding.
[2260.54s -> 2262.22s]  Join the war on depression.
[2262.22s -> 2263.18s]  That's okay.
[2263.90s -> 2268.27s]  I mean, yeah, but that was back to disc one.
[2271.79s -> 2272.43s]  Holy shit.
[2273.15s -> 2274.27s]  We go backwards?
[2274.75s -> 2281.23s]  Let's make sure this is disc one.
[2281.23s -> 2283.10s]  I got it.
[2283.10s -> 2284.22s]  We're in a loop.
[2284.22s -> 2285.18s]  I don't think it's a loop.
[2285.74s -> 2294.64s]  I think they just compiled all the video files alphabetically on each disc.
[2294.64s -> 2314.94s]  Here we go.
[2314.94s -> 2315.44s]  Movie.
[2331.45s -> 2332.81s]  Is this the guy from Command and Conquer?
[2333.85s -> 2336.09s]  Wait, why'd she just fall down?
[2336.81s -> 2354.76s]  Wouldn't she just standing right next to him?
[2354.76s -> 2355.80s]  Would she do that?
[2357.00s -> 2358.44s]  She went and found a painting of him.
[2362.54s -> 2363.66s]  Why'd she just punch him in the face?
[2365.74s -> 2384.09s]  I don't even know.
[2384.09s -> 2385.37s]  I left her alone.
[2385.37s -> 2386.97s]  I have no fucking idea.
[2387.85s -> 2389.28s]  I left her for him.
[2390.33s -> 2392.97s]  I saw like a Mazel Tov thing and then...
[2393.61s -> 2394.25s]  What's he doing?
[2395.45s -> 2396.49s]  Let's take him out.
[2396.49s -> 2397.05s]  I want to go.
[2397.05s -> 2398.01s]  What do you mean take him out?
[2398.01s -> 2398.65s]  Then go.
[2398.65s -> 2399.61s]  But I'm holding this.
[2400.89s -> 2403.76s]  Maximum me.
[2403.76s -> 2404.56s]  Maximum you.
[2405.28s -> 2407.88s]  Is that like a self-help guru?
[2408.60s -> 2414.19s]  We're just walking into this guy's...
[2414.19s -> 2416.11s]  He's crossed-armed waiting for us.
[2416.35s -> 2439.34s]  This is the kind of reaction you have and the noises you make when you first pull up
[2439.34s -> 2440.86s]  photo booth for the iPad.
[2445.58s -> 2446.78s]  It's true.
[2446.78s -> 2449.50s]  Everybody played their part perfectly.
[2455.29s -> 2456.65s]  This is how you do it.
[2457.45s -> 2459.21s]  No wasted motion.
[2459.21s -> 2461.69s]  No parlor tricks.
[2461.69s -> 2463.13s]  Say goodbye to the girl.
[2463.93s -> 2464.73s]  Go to the car.
[2467.40s -> 2467.88s]  Harder.
[2468.83s -> 2470.83s]  Don't you want to see her cry?
[2470.83s -> 2471.07s]  No.
[2471.79s -> 2472.83s]  You think I need your help?
[2473.39s -> 2473.71s]  Oh wait.
[2473.71s -> 2474.51s]  You think I want you watching me?
[2474.51s -> 2475.71s]  He's psychic detecting me.
[2475.71s -> 2477.15s]  You're a cheerleader, a throw-ruck.
[2477.87s -> 2478.43s]  Now move!
[2479.82s -> 2480.06s]  Go!
[2480.06s -> 2480.70s]  Damn it.
[2480.70s -> 2484.00s]  Good boy.
[2484.00s -> 2485.36s]  Daddy's good boy.
[2486.24s -> 2488.00s]  Nobody wants to burn you.
[2489.08s -> 2491.64s]  Just bring me the toy.
[2491.64s -> 2496.04s]  These are the good times.
[2496.04s -> 2496.68s]  Bad ending.
[2498.97s -> 2500.65s]  The old man knew I was the best.
[2500.65s -> 2502.33s]  There was never any question about that.
[2503.21s -> 2506.09s]  The question was how to keep me happy.
[2506.09s -> 2509.77s]  You can't turn referee into a trendy style.
[2509.77s -> 2510.57s]  I'm sorry.
[2510.57s -> 2512.01s]  That fucking best don't work.
[2512.01s -> 2513.29s]  I made him look brilliant.
[2514.09s -> 2517.04s]  Surrendered Jim Chujinka.
[2517.04s -> 2518.94s]  Miss Layla.
[2518.94s -> 2521.66s]  But she is so stubborn.
[2521.66s -> 2527.66s]  And I get so pissed off.
[2531.77s -> 2533.21s]  Oh not this again.
[2533.21s -> 2534.01s]  Okay.
[2534.01s -> 2540.25s]  Cigarette versus, I don't know, a metronome and Bill Murray.
[2540.97s -> 2542.65s]  Versus, and the toy.
[2543.37s -> 2547.96s]  There's no shoe.
[2547.96s -> 2549.56s]  Oh wait, he had a shoe already.
[2549.56s -> 2550.36s]  Your move.
[2550.36s -> 2551.72s]  Try to be interesting.
[2551.72s -> 2552.92s]  Okay, we're gonna go cigarette.
[2553.72s -> 2560.00s]  No, we're gonna go toy onto shoe.
[2562.25s -> 2563.85s]  It's my game now.
[2564.49s -> 2566.01s]  The old man can rot.
[2566.81s -> 2568.17s]  I make the rules.
[2568.73s -> 2571.37s]  It means whatever I want it to mean.
[2572.33s -> 2578.43s]  Okay, we're gonna go, uh.
[2578.43s -> 2579.63s]  You're a butcher.
[2579.63s -> 2580.67s]  I'm a surgeon.
[2581.23s -> 2586.03s]  Lancing and popping all the little pimples that stain my natural glory.
[2586.03s -> 2590.49s]  So this has been just a psychic fight between the two of us the whole time.
[2591.21s -> 2596.11s]  A lot of real estate for a lucky man.
[2597.07s -> 2598.83s]  Sorry, I still have the, I still have the metronome.
[2600.86s -> 2601.98s]  It blocked.
[2601.98s -> 2603.02s]  Why'd she do it, Max?
[2603.74s -> 2604.22s]  I don't know.
[2604.86s -> 2605.90s]  She gave up.
[2605.90s -> 2608.38s]  She couldn't stand to see you become such a monster.
[2613.55s -> 2614.59s]  Okay, this is important.
[2615.71s -> 2616.99s]  Metronome versus shoe?
[2617.63s -> 2620.40s]  Or metronome versus lady?
[2620.40s -> 2620.88s]  I don't know.
[2625.42s -> 2625.92s]  Shoe.
[2627.12s -> 2628.56s]  Fuck, they canceled each other out.
[2628.56s -> 2642.03s]  Canceling each other out like smothering a silent stream.
[2642.03s -> 2646.16s]  War, you are so handsome.
[2648.20s -> 2649.72s]  So full of blood.
[2650.36s -> 2651.48s]  Of the balls.
[2652.52s -> 2654.12s]  I'm not even playing cards.
[2654.12s -> 2654.84s]  Double war.
[2656.22s -> 2658.62s]  If only I could die.
[2660.12s -> 2661.08s]  I win.
[2661.08s -> 2661.56s]  I win.
[2662.12s -> 2662.84s]  Kiki, I win.
[2663.56s -> 2664.06s]  Kiki!
[2665.16s -> 2665.66s]  Kiki!
[2671.04s -> 2672.32s]  Okay, so that's a bad ending.
[2675.96s -> 2676.84s]  Moki's playmate.
[2676.84s -> 2677.56s]  The village idiot.
[2677.56s -> 2678.36s]  This little piggy.
[2678.36s -> 2679.08s]  Maximum eric.
[2679.08s -> 2680.20s]  Double war.
[2680.20s -> 2681.40s]  Pooka lounge blues.
[2681.40s -> 2682.44s]  Lexi's last laugh.
[2682.44s -> 2683.16s]  Change heads.
[2683.90s -> 2685.26s]  No third chances.
[2685.26s -> 2685.98s]  Pretty bracelet.
[2685.98s -> 2687.02s]  The healing hothead.
[2687.02s -> 2687.90s]  The big kiss.
[2687.90s -> 2688.78s]  And the grand slam.
[2689.98s -> 2691.18s]  If you turn the menu over,
[2691.74s -> 2695.04s]  you'll see our list of our beverages.
[2695.04s -> 2696.48s]  And some alcohol.
[2696.48s -> 2697.92s]  You can order as well.
[2697.92s -> 2702.81s]  Start it a little bit.
[2702.81s -> 2703.69s]  Buck that one up a little.
[2703.69s -> 2704.09s]  It's okay.
[2705.02s -> 2705.66s]  Come on!
[2707.85s -> 2709.21s]  Give me that one.
[2709.21s -> 2717.76s]  Did you play black diamond with madam?
[2719.12s -> 2719.68s]  Tikonov?
[2721.92s -> 2722.42s]  Did I?
[2728.14s -> 2728.86s]  Belvages.
[2728.86s -> 2730.14s]  Yeah, yeah, belvages.
[2731.93s -> 2732.97s]  And now what?
[2732.97s -> 2734.62s]  Is that it?
[2734.62s -> 2737.04s]  Do we do it again?
[2737.04s -> 2737.84s]  All right.
[2737.84s -> 2739.44s]  Now that I know what's going on,
[2739.44s -> 2740.92s]  I want to try to do it again.
[2740.92s -> 2746.52s]  Now that I know what's happening,
[2746.52s -> 2747.16s]  I want to try.
[2747.16s -> 2748.36s]  I want to do it one more time.
[2748.36s -> 2748.92s]  Do you?
[2748.92s -> 2756.28s]  No, but yes.
[2756.28s -> 2758.12s]  We have to try a separate outcome.
[2758.12s -> 2768.32s]  Here we go.
[2768.96s -> 2770.49s]  We get invited to the dinner party.
[2775.82s -> 2777.42s]  That's my sister, Monica.
[2777.42s -> 2778.22s]  Okay, Monica.
[2779.42s -> 2780.38s]  He was hoping to come in first.
[2780.38s -> 2781.42s]  I can't believe it.
[2781.90s -> 2783.50s]  Your sister doesn't waste much time.
[2783.50s -> 2784.54s]  We have to get into Sylvia's head
[2784.54s -> 2785.66s]  because we're going to watch her kill the guy.
[2786.30s -> 2791.66s]  Meet him at the tea room at 10 o'clock.
[2791.66s -> 2792.54s]  I can change channels.
[2792.54s -> 2794.30s]  This is just in real time.
[2794.30s -> 2797.77s]  I miss the good times.
[2797.77s -> 2799.53s]  Monica, focus.
[2799.53s -> 2801.37s]  Max wants to make you an offer.
[2801.37s -> 2802.25s]  To me?
[2802.25s -> 2803.93s]  Mirage Quest would like to handle
[2803.93s -> 2805.37s]  your father's collection.
[2805.37s -> 2806.57s]  Which one?
[2806.57s -> 2807.85s]  Tea room, 10 o'clock, yep.
[2807.85s -> 2810.01s]  Max, Mirage will personally help you.
[2811.13s -> 2812.89s]  I could accept no less than 200.
[2812.89s -> 2815.21s]  Have you no shame, idiot?
[2816.92s -> 2819.80s]  It's just a giant twister spinner.
[2820.60s -> 2822.68s]  It's not ready for twister, you bastard.
[2824.00s -> 2826.32s]  We do that after our dessert drinks.
[2835.36s -> 2835.92s]  Okay, here we go.
[2838.73s -> 2839.85s]  Play Black Diamond with her.
[2847.79s -> 2848.75s]  All right, Black Diamond.
[2848.83s -> 2851.55s]  Felt like a good time to get acquainted with dad.
[2851.55s -> 2853.23s]  What worked in the Pooka Room
[2853.23s -> 2854.75s]  was bound to work around here.
[2855.63s -> 2860.35s]  The house had seen better days.
[2860.99s -> 2862.91s]  Better days, worse days.
[2862.91s -> 2864.99s]  It was just starting to give a big wet kiss
[2864.99s -> 2866.43s]  to the rotten days.
[2866.43s -> 2868.91s]  And there was stuff all around keeping secrets.
[2869.55s -> 2870.43s]  I wanted to find more.
[2870.43s -> 2870.93s]  Window.
[2875.13s -> 2879.52s]  He threw him out the window.
[2882.81s -> 2883.29s]  Yep.
[2883.29s -> 2884.81s]  I must ask you to go.
[2885.53s -> 2887.29s]  Your uncle was a big noise.
[2887.37s -> 2888.97s]  A real player in the old country.
[2890.17s -> 2891.45s]  Paranormal espionage.
[2891.45s -> 2892.65s]  We have to go to Chad.
[2893.61s -> 2895.85s]  But perhaps you would be interested
[2895.85s -> 2896.89s]  in a little collectible.
[2898.17s -> 2900.25s]  Chadster, shame on you.
[2900.25s -> 2900.89s]  This is Chad.
[2902.28s -> 2903.16s]  All right, stay with Chad.
[2910.17s -> 2911.29s]  She comes in and she stabs him.
[2921.71s -> 2922.59s]  Save him.
[2922.59s -> 2923.39s]  Can I?
[2923.39s -> 2925.82s]  But not to touch.
[2925.82s -> 2926.54s]  Oh, shit.
[2926.54s -> 2927.66s]  I just jumped onto the game board.
[2927.66s -> 2928.62s]  We're not going to see Chad die.
[2936.84s -> 2940.75s]  You are bold, disobedient.
[2942.11s -> 2943.87s]  That is good.
[2943.87s -> 2945.39s]  You will need to be reckless.
[2945.39s -> 2946.91s]  This is a Christopher Walken character.
[2946.91s -> 2954.28s]  He was lexing me up in hell for all I care.
[2954.28s -> 2955.02s]  What'd he do?
[2956.59s -> 2959.63s]  He was Vladimir's most brilliant pupil.
[2959.63s -> 2960.99s]  It's like SNL skit.
[2960.99s -> 2965.39s]  We first to learn how to destroy the black diamond.
[2965.39s -> 2966.75s]  Oh, she's going to teach me how to play.
[2967.39s -> 2969.31s]  Bash the hell out of a kitty cat?
[2969.31s -> 2970.35s]  Real brilliant.
[2970.35s -> 2977.12s]  Child is a symbol of the real power.
[2979.10s -> 2979.90s]  Time is right.
[2984.57s -> 2985.77s]  Oh, she could sense the murder.
[2985.77s -> 2986.65s]  Who is in the study?
[2987.21s -> 2988.01s]  Sleazy Chad.
[2988.57s -> 2990.01s]  Quickly, go to him.
[2991.13s -> 2999.87s]  What are you doing?
[2999.87s -> 3000.59s]  Get, should I get out?
[3001.15s -> 3002.28s]  Give me the inkblot.
[3002.28s -> 3009.05s]  Why do we call him Sleazy Chad?
[3009.05s -> 3010.41s]  Can't we just call him Chad?
[3016.19s -> 3019.07s]  She was hitting decibels dangerous to psychics and dogs.
[3019.79s -> 3022.19s]  Seemed like a good time to find my lovely escort.
[3029.69s -> 3031.37s]  What the hell is going on?
[3031.37s -> 3032.97s]  Dead body, lots of blood.
[3032.97s -> 3034.17s]  Your sister thinks I did it.
[3034.17s -> 3035.77s]  Decibels does not equal frequency.
[3035.77s -> 3036.73s]  Give me a break.
[3036.73s -> 3037.45s]  Come on, let's go.
[3039.21s -> 3039.85s]  Yeah, so?
[3040.73s -> 3041.37s]  All right, here we go.
[3041.37s -> 3044.73s]  We're on the right track.
[3044.73s -> 3046.73s]  This time, I'm going to stay as Bagman.
[3046.73s -> 3048.65s]  I'm not going to change from Bagman this time.
[3048.65s -> 3058.19s]  I want to be Bagman for the rest of the playthrough.
[3058.19s -> 3060.51s]  No, shit, I think I misplaced the second disc.
[3060.51s -> 3061.95s]  No, shit, that's Jurassic Park.
[3061.95s -> 3062.75s]  It looks the exact same.
[3062.75s -> 3064.65s]  Where'd it go?
[3064.65s -> 3065.13s]  Oh, no.
[3066.78s -> 3069.10s]  Disc three, that's disc one.
[3069.10s -> 3069.90s]  Where's disc two?
[3075.02s -> 3080.12s]  This is why I fucking hated having multiple discs.
[3080.12s -> 3082.60s]  You could always just get to the same part of Final Fantasy VII
[3082.60s -> 3084.28s]  before you had to stop.
[3084.28s -> 3085.88s]  Right before you met Kat-Sith.
[3086.52s -> 3108.80s]  We got spoilers.
[3108.80s -> 3109.92s]  It's a character in the game.
[3109.92s -> 3110.88s]  What are you talking about?
[3110.88s -> 3113.60s]  All right, these are both right here.
[3113.60s -> 3114.72s]  I got them right in front of me.
[3114.72s -> 3120.06s]  It's not, it's Kate, not Kat.
[3123.76s -> 3124.80s]  Kat, write nothing back.
[3124.80s -> 3126.00s]  Lousy party.
[3126.00s -> 3128.72s]  I sat there knowing two things dead certain.
[3128.72s -> 3130.80s]  Laynen was going to drag me in deeper
[3130.80s -> 3134.24s]  and I was going to follow like some over-sex schnauzer.
[3135.68s -> 3137.68s]  All right, should I not touch the bracelet this time?
[3137.68s -> 3139.76s]  Obtahoka, what's that mean?
[3140.64s -> 3142.16s]  It means stop it.
[3142.80s -> 3144.16s]  All right, kiss me sound whacked.
[3144.72s -> 3146.48s]  Your dad really did jump out the window.
[3146.48s -> 3147.52s]  You sound whacked.
[3147.52s -> 3148.72s]  Not exactly suicide.
[3149.36s -> 3150.32s]  What was it?
[3150.96s -> 3151.84s]  I don't know.
[3151.84s -> 3153.76s]  As someone was messing with his head.
[3153.76s -> 3155.76s]  That's not possible.
[3156.92s -> 3157.42s]  What's not?
[3159.29s -> 3159.93s]  Well, you know.
[3160.49s -> 3162.57s]  This is some ugly ass seat covers.
[3162.57s -> 3164.09s]  I'm still trying to get used to it.
[3164.81s -> 3165.45s]  Yeah, right.
[3166.17s -> 3167.69s]  You sure look busted up about it.
[3170.06s -> 3170.94s]  So are we good night?
[3171.58s -> 3172.97s]  All right.
[3172.97s -> 3173.77s]  What's Monica?
[3174.25s -> 3175.05s]  Just a little more.
[3175.05s -> 3175.77s]  I'm gonna let her go.
[3175.77s -> 3177.85s]  I do not trust this mirage quest.
[3177.85s -> 3178.81s]  I'm gonna let her go.
[3178.81s -> 3179.45s]  You're going?
[3180.51s -> 3181.23s]  I have to.
[3181.79s -> 3182.67s]  Don't ask why.
[3183.71s -> 3184.27s]  Just hate.
[3185.29s -> 3186.25s]  I don't like the rules.
[3186.25s -> 3186.75s]  What?
[3188.16s -> 3188.96s]  Eric.
[3188.96s -> 3190.00s]  Maybe I want to know why.
[3190.72s -> 3192.24s]  People are in danger.
[3192.24s -> 3193.28s]  Let's be specific.
[3194.08s -> 3197.68s]  Lexi, Anna, all my cousins, little children.
[3197.68s -> 3198.72s]  Just trust me.
[3198.72s -> 3200.16s]  I have to follow Monica.
[3200.16s -> 3201.12s]  I might come by later.
[3201.12s -> 3201.76s]  Bring the boyfriend.
[3201.76s -> 3203.28s]  Bring the whole box of dirty secrets.
[3203.92s -> 3206.32s]  If there's a knife in my back, throw it in the sink.
[3206.32s -> 3207.12s]  I'll do it in the morning.
[3207.12s -> 3207.62s]  What?
[3208.56s -> 3210.73s]  What do you mean if there's a knife in my back?
[3213.24s -> 3216.17s]  I got something in my eye.
[3216.81s -> 3218.22s]  Should I follow her?
[3218.86s -> 3220.54s]  I'm gonna try to get a different outcome this time.
[3220.54s -> 3221.04s]  All right.
[3221.66s -> 3223.48s]  We're gonna just go inside of her head.
[3223.48s -> 3227.55s]  Something's in my eye.
[3227.55s -> 3228.19s]  It's horrible.
[3228.19s -> 3229.47s]  It's like a knife in my eye.
[3242.08s -> 3242.58s]  What?
[3246.48s -> 3246.98s]  How are you?
[3247.44s -> 3249.44s]  Mokie found dead.
[3249.44s -> 3251.55s]  You're that psychic kid.
[3251.55s -> 3252.35s]  Flasho.
[3252.35s -> 3253.55s]  Flash in the pan.
[3253.55s -> 3254.51s]  I've seen the act.
[3254.51s -> 3255.47s]  I'm gonna get arrested.
[3256.19s -> 3258.67s]  To my pal, Mokie.
[3258.67s -> 3259.95s]  Listen, you little putz.
[3259.95s -> 3261.15s]  You're flying blind.
[3261.15s -> 3262.43s]  You need Mokie.
[3262.43s -> 3264.11s]  Mokie knows the dirt.
[3264.11s -> 3264.99s]  I think we need Mokie.
[3264.99s -> 3267.23s]  I got it stored in my cheeks.
[3267.23s -> 3268.43s]  That would explain the breath.
[3269.23s -> 3271.39s]  Listen, you do me a little job.
[3271.39s -> 3272.83s]  I clue you in.
[3272.83s -> 3273.39s]  Oh, shit.
[3273.39s -> 3275.39s]  You say, Foxy, time's a-
[3275.39s -> 3275.79s]  No, no, no.
[3275.79s -> 3276.51s]  We're gonna go with Mokie.
[3277.85s -> 3278.65s]  It's maybe a mistake.
[3311.48s -> 3312.28s]  Who is this guy?
[3313.88s -> 3314.84s]  Where do you fit in?
[3314.84s -> 3316.44s]  I ran a little office.
[3316.44s -> 3318.44s]  Code name, Svengali.
[3318.44s -> 3320.44s]  You're a spook?
[3320.44s -> 3321.56s]  I'm a broker.
[3321.56s -> 3323.00s]  Lexi wants it effect.
[3323.00s -> 3324.04s]  I bring the dough.
[3324.04s -> 3326.04s]  He brings me one of these.
[3326.04s -> 3327.72s]  Then what happened?
[3327.72s -> 3329.40s]  He grabbed two and flew.
[3329.40s -> 3331.40s]  Too bad his chopper didn't.
[3331.40s -> 3333.40s]  These photos are huge.
[3333.40s -> 3335.40s]  I'm standing in Finland, my juts in my hands.
[3335.40s -> 3337.40s]  And a Svengali.
[3337.40s -> 3339.40s]  So that leaves two collectors.
[3339.40s -> 3341.40s]  He's not only psychic, he can count.
[3341.40s -> 3345.44s]  All right, let's get to work.
[3345.52s -> 3346.16s]  Here's the gig.
[3346.80s -> 3350.64s]  You piggyback inside and get to Max Mirage's table.
[3350.64s -> 3352.16s]  Main room, far left corner.
[3352.16s -> 3352.66s]  Yep.
[3353.28s -> 3354.56s]  It's not like I use a map.
[3355.60s -> 3357.20s]  Hey, I wouldn't know.
[3357.20s -> 3358.08s]  I'm not psychic.
[3358.08s -> 3359.68s]  I don't have the sexy gift.
[3359.68s -> 3361.84s]  I just come from a clean straight shot home
[3361.84s -> 3363.04s]  where nobody mess me up.
[3363.76s -> 3365.04s]  What's that supposed to mean?
[3365.04s -> 3366.16s]  Exactly what it means.
[3366.16s -> 3367.36s]  I know things.
[3368.40s -> 3369.44s]  As usual.
[3369.44s -> 3369.94s]  Sexy.
[3371.52s -> 3372.02s]  Okay.
[3372.64s -> 3374.80s]  Is there opportunity?
[3374.80s -> 3376.32s]  There's a phone call coming in.
[3376.32s -> 3376.82s]  Fake it.
[3376.82s -> 3377.32s]  Two minutes.
[3378.00s -> 3378.96s]  Be there for it.
[3378.96s -> 3380.88s]  And don't screw me.
[3380.88s -> 3381.60s]  It's a phone call.
[3382.48s -> 3383.52s]  Did I, I didn't fake it?
[3386.20s -> 3388.03s]  He's still sitting here?
[3388.03s -> 3391.52s]  Psychic bastard, where are you?
[3391.52s -> 3392.02s]  Inside?
[3392.89s -> 3393.93s]  Have we crossed the room?
[3393.93s -> 3395.85s]  Oh, I'm faking being inside.
[3409.64s -> 3410.44s]  Kill him.
[3423.76s -> 3425.28s]  Yeah, I'm with you.
[3425.28s -> 3426.16s]  How to play.
[3426.16s -> 3427.20s]  Let's hear it.
[3427.20s -> 3428.40s]  You put the fear of God in him.
[3429.76s -> 3431.12s]  Why does it go smoke?
[3431.12s -> 3432.64s]  Anyone hear him talking roosties?
[3432.64s -> 3433.76s]  Just the whole damn room.
[3434.56s -> 3435.76s]  You're a lying little punk.
[3436.64s -> 3438.48s]  Maybe I couldn't get there in time.
[3438.48s -> 3440.08s]  Maybe you're full of crap.
[3440.96s -> 3443.84s]  Why don't you go peep the psychic slot?
[3443.84s -> 3445.12s]  That's about your speed.
[3445.68s -> 3446.18s]  What?
[3446.96s -> 3452.27s]  And if you're thinking of taking a ride in my head.
[3452.99s -> 3458.65s]  It wouldn't hurt that much.
[3458.65s -> 3459.77s]  That would not even really hurt.
[3460.57s -> 3463.10s]  That'd be slightly irritating.
[3463.10s -> 3464.94s]  Wait, we just got telltale.
[3467.08s -> 3467.58s]  No.
[3468.12s -> 3469.32s]  Psychic pizza.
[3469.32s -> 3470.68s]  We know when you're hungry.
[3470.68s -> 3477.69s]  Okay, let's get this part right.
[3479.40s -> 3482.65s]  This guy ends up with like three stab wounds in his chest.
[3482.65s -> 3483.61s]  We have to stop it.
[3489.80s -> 3492.40s]  Kiki's the, Kiki's the toy.
[3493.98s -> 3494.86s]  Well, who do you think?
[3494.86s -> 3496.38s]  This guy gets murdered.
[3498.97s -> 3500.25s]  We have to follow him around.
[3500.25s -> 3501.21s]  He's so pleased with himself.
[3501.21s -> 3501.77s]  What's his name?
[3501.77s -> 3504.97s]  Such an elegant solution to such a messy situation.
[3505.85s -> 3507.61s]  The two of you he didn't approve?
[3508.25s -> 3509.64s]  Oh, please.
[3510.28s -> 3512.17s]  I just don't want to explain.
[3512.89s -> 3520.60s]  All right.
[3520.60s -> 3522.12s]  Yeah, that's the four device.
[3522.12s -> 3523.16s]  He laughs at the rodents.
[3524.12s -> 3545.28s]  He died.
[3549.32s -> 3550.44s]  Kiki is the doll.
[3551.40s -> 3556.24s]  Can't we help him?
[3557.12s -> 3559.48s]  Okay, here we go.
[3560.04s -> 3562.06s]  This is where it all goes to hell.
[3562.06s -> 3563.74s]  Is how I fucked it up last time.
[3563.74s -> 3566.16s]  We're going to jump to somebody else here.
[3567.32s -> 3568.36s]  We need all four.
[3569.32s -> 3572.78s]  And you think I can find the other three?
[3574.52s -> 3575.72s]  I just hope you're ready.
[3577.79s -> 3578.19s]  Help him.
[3578.19s -> 3578.67s]  I'm going to try.
[3579.63s -> 3582.41s]  Because last time I didn't go to the old lady.
[3584.68s -> 3586.44s]  We came back here and there's a bunch of dead people.
[3606.75s -> 3606.99s]  Okay.
[3606.99s -> 3607.31s]  All right.
[3607.31s -> 3607.55s]  All right.
[3611.20s -> 3611.52s]  Max.
[3613.84s -> 3615.12s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[3615.12s -> 3616.40s]  Go back, back, back, back, back, back, back.
[3621.88s -> 3622.52s]  No, shit.
[3634.24s -> 3636.99s]  We left for two seconds, man.
[3640.76s -> 3644.44s]  I just like in the time it took me to wash my hands in the bathroom.
[3647.31s -> 3650.91s]  You're under arrest for murder of Sergei Nosenko and Chatskovsky.
[3650.91s -> 3651.79s]  He died.
[3651.79s -> 3654.11s]  You have the right to remain silent.
[3654.11s -> 3655.15s]  You have the right to literature.
[3655.15s -> 3656.03s]  Can I go back?
[3656.03s -> 3659.47s]  Anything you say can and you'll be used against you in a court of law.
[3660.83s -> 3662.67s]  I went to the same guy.
[3668.81s -> 3669.37s]  Redo.
[3669.37s -> 3670.41s]  I think I'm okay.
[3670.41s -> 3671.05s]  I think I'm okay.
[3671.05s -> 3671.69s]  I think I'm ready.
[3671.69s -> 3673.13s]  How long have you known Chatskovsky?
[3673.13s -> 3674.57s]  Why didn't Lena want you at the house?
[3674.57s -> 3675.61s]  You boffing her, kid?
[3675.61s -> 3676.73s]  You want to be boffing her?
[3676.73s -> 3678.33s]  What kind of game is she running?
[3678.33s -> 3680.17s]  She's looking for a psycho collector.
[3680.89s -> 3682.97s]  A whole bunch of people are looking for her.
[3682.97s -> 3684.57s]  Her dad made him four of them.
[3684.57s -> 3685.69s]  They're unbelievable.
[3685.69s -> 3688.33s]  It's kind of like some crystal hugging hop head.
[3690.17s -> 3691.85s]  Guys, I know this is hard to believe.
[3691.85s -> 3693.53s]  There was only one way to slip.
[3693.53s -> 3694.89s]  Somebody said cigarettes are cool.
[3694.89s -> 3695.93s]  Yeah, I have a cigarette.
[3697.13s -> 3699.66s]  Everybody smokes inside.
[3699.66s -> 3703.18s]  Everybody has yellow curtains and yellow stained ceilings.
[3703.18s -> 3707.61s]  No wonder.
[3709.13s -> 3712.09s]  A realtor is going to come in and say the property value dropped by like
[3712.09s -> 3714.57s]  40 grand because the whole house is yellow.
[3716.78s -> 3718.97s]  I smoke in the house.
[3718.97s -> 3727.92s]  I think I can still salvage it, though.
[3727.92s -> 3729.20s]  I really think I can.
[3729.20s -> 3740.80s]  I can't believe the exact thing.
[3740.80s -> 3742.16s]  Dude fucking died again.
[3742.16s -> 3743.52s]  And that guy came in with a gun.
[3743.52s -> 3745.28s]  He didn't even shoot anybody, though.
[3745.28s -> 3754.94s]  All right, I'm going to get this right.
[3754.94s -> 3755.34s]  Here we go.
[3755.34s -> 3758.32s]  Ready and go.
[3760.81s -> 3761.05s]  Shit.
[3761.05s -> 3761.53s]  No.
[3761.53s -> 3761.85s]  Back.
[3779.68s -> 3780.32s]  I don't suck.
[3787.60s -> 3788.80s]  Why did I click that?
[3789.60s -> 3790.72s]  Why did I click that?
[3791.76s -> 3793.20s]  Why did I click that?
[3793.20s -> 3795.60s]  I tried to piece the night back together.
[3795.60s -> 3799.44s]  That psychic slushy cup collector had torqued me sideways.
[3800.00s -> 3801.92s]  And something was trying to bubble up.
[3802.56s -> 3806.60s]  I had done this.
[3806.60s -> 3806.84s]  No.
[3806.84s -> 3807.16s]  All right.
[3807.16s -> 3808.68s]  Let's go somewhere else.
[3808.68s -> 3809.96s]  Can I psychic somewhere else?
[3812.97s -> 3820.91s]  I never trespassed again until last night.
[3820.91s -> 3824.56s]  And like a sick joke, he threw me in the closet.
[3828.09s -> 3828.97s]  I think we still get out.
[3831.56s -> 3833.08s]  There was squat to do.
[3833.08s -> 3834.36s]  Hard to keep the mind sharp.
[3835.08s -> 3837.24s]  I thought about all the women I'd ever slept with.
[3837.24s -> 3837.88s]  What?
[3837.88s -> 3839.56s]  All the women I wish I'd slept with.
[3840.20s -> 3841.72s]  All the women who called me shallow.
[3841.72s -> 3842.68s]  Is this what you care about?
[3849.31s -> 3853.15s]  And then I thought about like, you know, what the plan was going to be.
[3862.40s -> 3865.80s]  Oh, we had a new follower just came in.
[3865.80s -> 3866.28s]  A new viewer.
[3866.28s -> 3894.89s]  Welcome him.
[3894.89s -> 3895.21s]  Welcome.
[3910.62s -> 3911.42s]  Okay, this is it.
[3913.15s -> 3913.95s]  Opportunity here.
[3914.51s -> 3915.63s]  Wait, it's different.
[3921.05s -> 3921.45s]  Bokey.
[3927.85s -> 3929.93s]  Sort of psychic seal of approval.
[3929.93s -> 3932.09s]  Make sure my collector ain't a fake.
[3933.13s -> 3934.25s]  Come on, kid.
[3934.25s -> 3935.21s]  Clock's a ticking.
[3935.21s -> 3935.69s]  What do you think?
[3935.69s -> 3936.33s]  Yeah, we're going to go.
[3937.13s -> 3938.65s]  This is white hot.
[3938.65s -> 3940.49s]  We snag a collector.
[3940.49s -> 3941.69s]  We're big league.
[3941.69s -> 3942.57s]  Psychic mercenaries.
[3942.57s -> 3944.17s]  Eyes on the road, please.
[3944.17s -> 3945.77s]  That collector belongs to Lena.
[3945.77s -> 3946.65s]  The hell it does.
[3946.65s -> 3948.49s]  I shelled out cash four years ago.
[3948.49s -> 3949.13s]  So you say.
[3949.93s -> 3951.37s]  Don't you get it?
[3951.37s -> 3953.05s]  Lexi never died.
[3953.85s -> 3956.81s]  A face job and a lounge act worse than yours.
[3957.45s -> 3958.49s]  Max Mirage.
[3958.49s -> 3959.85s]  No, Wayne Newton.
[3959.85s -> 3960.89s]  Come on, kid.
[3960.89s -> 3961.85s]  Get with the beat.
[3962.97s -> 3963.93s]  That ponytail.
[3964.97s -> 3966.51s]  Okay, here we are.
[3967.95s -> 3974.04s]  And Sylvia.
[3974.04s -> 3974.84s]  He's very small.
[3975.72s -> 3976.44s]  What are you doing?
[3976.44s -> 3976.92s]  Harry.
[3976.92s -> 3977.96s]  I didn't know he's that small.
[3978.68s -> 3981.08s]  Ask you the same question.
[3981.08s -> 3983.00s]  Strictly insurance.
[3983.00s -> 3985.16s]  Make sure you got the genuine goods.
[3985.96s -> 3987.00s]  You ready?
[3987.00s -> 3988.44s]  No, I got to tape my ankles.
[3989.32s -> 3989.88s]  Let her rip.
[3995.87s -> 3997.79s]  I'm way taller than that.
[3999.93s -> 4000.25s]  Okay.
[4013.05s -> 4014.09s]  You can go weirder.
[4014.65s -> 4014.97s]  What?
[4016.01s -> 4016.97s]  Much weirder.
[4019.13s -> 4023.85s]  Take the lint out of your back pocket and stuff it into a chicken breast and eat it.
[4029.72s -> 4031.13s]  Give me the collector.
[4034.14s -> 4035.34s]  Well, let's get weird.
[4038.08s -> 4039.84s]  Somebody call the fire department.
[4039.84s -> 4040.40s]  Let's bail.
[4040.56s -> 4047.05s]  Oh, hey.
[4047.05s -> 4047.53s]  Sorry.
[4048.60s -> 4049.40s]  It's yours.
[4049.40s -> 4050.12s]  What?
[4050.12s -> 4051.40s]  Fuck.
[4051.40s -> 4054.01s]  Get a grip.
[4054.01s -> 4055.05s]  Try short.
[4055.05s -> 4056.09s]  Whose limo is this?
[4056.73s -> 4058.17s]  This wasn't the deal.
[4058.17s -> 4058.81s]  You're right.
[4059.85s -> 4060.09s]  Run.
[4063.64s -> 4069.16s]  Yeah, I was a coward and he was toast, lightly buttered and burnt to a crisp.
[4069.16s -> 4073.48s]  Max Mirage knew all the black diamond tricks, but he was never going to share them.
[4074.76s -> 4075.40s]  What is this?
[4076.36s -> 4078.56s]  It just went up on the curb.
[4079.12s -> 4085.98s]  I've been looking for you for hours.
[4085.98s -> 4087.34s]  Sorry, I was trying to help Moki.
[4088.46s -> 4089.58s]  What happened?
[4089.58s -> 4090.30s]  Fried rice.
[4091.93s -> 4093.53s]  Max has three collectors.
[4093.53s -> 4094.81s]  He's a lexian disguise.
[4095.37s -> 4096.09s]  What's new with you?
[4097.37s -> 4097.85s]  Monica.
[4098.49s -> 4099.69s]  How do we get out of this mess?
[4101.66s -> 4103.10s]  By making Q stronger.
[4103.10s -> 4103.98s]  I got to get stronger.
[4105.18s -> 4105.58s]  Okay.
[4105.58s -> 4106.38s]  Yeah, here we go.
[4106.38s -> 4107.82s]  Back to the mansion.
[4107.82s -> 4113.98s]  She has to see it alone and I'll wait in here.
[4113.98s -> 4114.78s]  Wait.
[4114.78s -> 4115.42s]  Look.
[4115.42s -> 4116.46s]  Come here.
[4116.46s -> 4117.10s]  It's here.
[4117.10s -> 4118.14s]  The fourth collector.
[4120.49s -> 4121.53s]  Please, Eric.
[4121.53s -> 4123.53s]  Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[4123.53s -> 4124.33s]  I've missed them all.
[4124.33s -> 4124.89s]  I missed them all.
[4124.89s -> 4125.53s]  I didn't know what to do.
[4126.33s -> 4129.47s]  I was going to go to Madame T.
[4139.64s -> 4140.52s]  Jeremy, you stink.
[4141.24s -> 4147.77s]  Hey, I'm not going to get the same ending.
[4159.00s -> 4160.68s]  He had the case hidden away.
[4161.64s -> 4164.27s]  It's going to be the same ending.
[4164.27s -> 4165.55s]  It's not going to be the same ending.
[4176.11s -> 4178.51s]  He's strong because he has more of those collectors.
[4179.07s -> 4182.59s]  I need all four to beat him in the mind game.
[4183.39s -> 4185.05s]  All right, let's go to Madame T.
[4185.69s -> 4186.49s]  While we're still time.
[4187.05s -> 4188.09s]  Lexi killed your father.
[4190.06s -> 4191.18s]  How do you think?
[4191.18s -> 4193.18s]  I don't touch stuff so I can sniff my fingers.
[4194.91s -> 4195.79s]  Lexi is Max.
[4196.59s -> 4197.96s]  He came here with a collector,
[4197.96s -> 4199.80s]  started frying Vladimir inside out.
[4206.35s -> 4210.03s]  Did they say Lexi is Max with like plastic surgery?
[4210.03s -> 4213.15s]  He said he got his face changed and stuff.
[4213.79s -> 4217.02s]  And then did he say that?
[4217.74s -> 4218.70s]  I'm confused by that.
[4218.70s -> 4219.50s]  Anna.
[4224.22s -> 4224.78s]  Oh, right.
[4226.06s -> 4227.18s]  Smothering the old lady.
[4227.90s -> 4230.46s]  I'm going to work me over, Clash.
[4231.66s -> 4234.56s]  What do I do?
[4238.56s -> 4239.36s]  What do I do?
[4239.36s -> 4240.96s]  Is that considered a promotion?
[4240.96s -> 4242.00s]  Zip it, Fox.
[4242.00s -> 4243.12s]  I don't blame him.
[4243.12s -> 4244.64s]  Monica's a cute little thing.
[4245.36s -> 4246.56s]  Unforced beauty.
[4246.56s -> 4247.60s]  Only 21.
[4247.60s -> 4248.48s]  I'm not biting.
[4249.36s -> 4251.95s]  She and Max, we're talking a serious item here.
[4251.95s -> 4253.95s]  We're talking ransom.
[4253.95s -> 4255.23s]  That's about all.
[4255.23s -> 4258.19s]  You want her back, you bring the fourth collector.
[4258.19s -> 4261.55s]  And of course, I decided to break her neck just to piss you all.
[4262.27s -> 4264.56s]  I saved her.
[4265.04s -> 4266.56s]  How could you, Eric?
[4266.56s -> 4268.56s]  No, you do good.
[4268.56s -> 4269.28s]  See?
[4269.28s -> 4270.72s]  You see the itch.
[4270.72s -> 4272.16s]  You love the itch.
[4273.20s -> 4275.60s]  She will betray him.
[4276.40s -> 4276.96s]  I think we just...
[4277.76s -> 4278.96s]  Get the collector.
[4279.52s -> 4280.64s]  Go to Max.
[4281.44s -> 4283.04s]  Challenge him the game.
[4283.68s -> 4285.28s]  Why not get the collector?
[4285.92s -> 4286.64s]  Hide for Max.
[4286.64s -> 4287.52s]  Play with the collector.
[4287.52s -> 4289.52s]  He is too powerful.
[4290.32s -> 4294.40s]  If you do not stop him, he will hunt you like a dog.
[4294.48s -> 4295.60s]  I never got to practice.
[4298.16s -> 4299.36s]  Find the scar.
[4300.32s -> 4302.40s]  Choose me if you can.
[4302.40s -> 4302.96s]  I'll choose her.
[4302.96s -> 4303.76s]  It doesn't make sense.
[4305.36s -> 4307.36s]  Not all the games make sense.
[4307.36s -> 4308.72s]  Not all the games make sense.
[4308.72s -> 4309.76s]  It's a Christopher Walken character.
[4309.76s -> 4310.72s]  Let me try it.
[4310.72s -> 4312.00s]  You must not deplete yourself.
[4312.00s -> 4312.56s]  She's in the car?
[4312.56s -> 4313.92s]  I'm the hope, okay?
[4313.92s -> 4316.24s]  The old lady said, Eric, you're the boss.
[4316.24s -> 4317.04s]  You play Lexie.
[4317.04s -> 4320.00s]  You put your ass on the hibachi, not your bossy burnout sidekick.
[4322.44s -> 4323.64s]  No, I don't want to confront him, though.
[4323.64s -> 4324.36s]  I'm sorry we have to fight.
[4325.24s -> 4326.44s]  Choose her and the shoe.
[4327.48s -> 4334.84s]  Should I?
[4335.56s -> 4336.52s]  Should we go in there, though?
[4336.52s -> 4337.40s]  Or should we do something else?
[4337.40s -> 4339.16s]  Because look, it's like, oh, go get him.
[4339.72s -> 4340.84s]  We don't have to, though, do we?
[4341.56s -> 4345.39s]  Fuck you, game.
[4345.39s -> 4349.44s]  Okay, so what's the play here?
[4349.44s -> 4362.14s]  It's Madame T, shoe, cigarette, cigarette.
[4362.14s -> 4364.48s]  It's a walkthrough.
[4364.48s -> 4368.28s]  I guess I could, couldn't I?
[4368.28s -> 4369.87s]  Does it really matter?
[4370.43s -> 4378.27s]  Let's see.
[4378.27s -> 4380.19s]  Does anybody even have a walkthrough for this game?
[4389.85s -> 4395.52s]  Okay, if I remember this part.
[4395.52s -> 4397.20s]  Don't squeeze me out.
[4397.76s -> 4402.48s]  But she's a Karelian and so photogenic.
[4406.33s -> 4407.05s]  Okay, let me see.
[4416.36s -> 4418.36s]  Oh, tricks to play Black Diamond.
[4419.32s -> 4422.68s]  Anna, the kite, Monica, or Lena are powerful.
[4425.24s -> 4428.36s]  Monica's weakness is with the doll and Moki.
[4432.92s -> 4435.88s]  And Lena is a draw with the doll and Sergi.
[4439.56s -> 4441.56s]  I think I would ever figure this out on my own.
[4445.64s -> 4455.07s]  Hey, I left her alone.
[4455.07s -> 4456.14s]  I'm scared.
[4456.94s -> 4459.40s]  I left her for him.
[4459.96s -> 4468.19s]  Queen B is all hot and bothered.
[4468.19s -> 4469.23s]  I gotta rub that itch.
[4472.17s -> 4472.89s]  If you must.
[4473.45s -> 4474.97s]  Just let me hang on to this.
[4475.61s -> 4476.96s]  We're trying a different tactic.
[4477.68s -> 4479.07s]  Wait in there.
[4481.15s -> 4482.99s]  I got no time for catfights.
[4482.99s -> 4483.47s]  Now move.
[4483.47s -> 4486.91s]  Am I telling her to wait while I go spend time with this girl?
[4487.87s -> 4489.23s]  Wait, what?
[4507.29s -> 4511.05s]  You know, I'm rooting for you way deep down.
[4511.05s -> 4512.25s]  Can you help me beat Max?
[4513.69s -> 4514.73s]  Oh, right.
[4520.72s -> 4521.76s]  Creamsicle Moki?
[4522.72s -> 4523.12s]  Okay.
[4527.71s -> 4529.31s]  Which one of these is your favorite?
[4531.23s -> 4532.03s]  Soldier.
[4532.03s -> 4532.59s]  Good.
[4532.59s -> 4533.47s]  I'll tell you what.
[4534.27s -> 4538.94s]  You can have it, but I need to know what happened to you.
[4541.95s -> 4542.43s]  Scary.
[4543.55s -> 4547.02s]  What happened to him?
[4547.02s -> 4548.30s]  Why is he like three?
[4548.30s -> 4549.58s]  Do you remember where you were?
[4550.38s -> 4553.95s]  Do you know where Eric Fox is?
[4555.79s -> 4568.92s]  I'm here for me to adore there.
[4568.92s -> 4571.31s]  There's nobody in this audience.
[4572.03s -> 4574.03s]  Play your little hide and seek.
[4574.03s -> 4575.63s]  It's megalomaniac.
[4575.63s -> 4578.94s]  Only one game matters.
[4578.94s -> 4579.98s]  I don't think so.
[4583.07s -> 4585.66s]  What just happened?
[4585.66s -> 4589.69s]  When he's properly cooked.
[4589.69s -> 4591.61s]  Wait, we were just dead.
[4592.33s -> 4594.81s]  You took your time, Jim Chushika.
[4594.81s -> 4596.38s]  But you gave me all four.
[4596.38s -> 4597.34s]  Who's that dude?
[4598.54s -> 4600.94s]  Edik Tartu, Lexi.
[4601.74s -> 4603.10s]  Go on, get her out of here.
[4603.10s -> 4603.90s]  I want my sister.
[4606.14s -> 4608.62s]  But I'm so very fond of the Bozark family.
[4610.94s -> 4614.46s]  We were too busy watching the little kid play with toys.
[4615.10s -> 4617.02s]  Can we sort of skip the male bonding?
[4618.46s -> 4621.77s]  As you wish.
[4621.77s -> 4624.09s]  The old man only cared about results.
[4624.09s -> 4626.01s]  Total neuralytic paralysis.
[4626.65s -> 4629.13s]  But how do you destroy someone mentally?
[4629.69s -> 4630.65s]  You take their fear.
[4630.65s -> 4631.53s]  Okay, what is he afraid of?
[4631.53s -> 4634.89s]  Traumas and nightmares and turn them up.
[4635.53s -> 4639.69s]  Full volume, a hideous marching band at the back of the brain.
[4640.33s -> 4645.29s]  All very amusing with rabbits and mice and half dead soldiers.
[4646.49s -> 4649.02s]  When two people know what's happening.
[4649.02s -> 4649.90s]  Okay.
[4649.90s -> 4651.42s]  Two talented people.
[4651.42s -> 4653.50s]  It's really a most fascinating game.
[4653.50s -> 4654.14s]  Two.
[4654.14s -> 4655.26s]  You have your thoughts.
[4656.30s -> 4657.10s]  I have mine.
[4657.10s -> 4657.60s]  Three.
[4658.54s -> 4662.57s]  And winner takes...
[4662.57s -> 4663.07s]  Four.
[4664.25s -> 4665.61s]  He activated the four pillars.
[4666.57s -> 4667.13s]  Here we go.
[4667.85s -> 4668.35s]  Okay.
[4668.97s -> 4673.63s]  So who is it?
[4673.63s -> 4674.43s]  Who's Anna?
[4675.07s -> 4678.46s]  The cat.
[4678.46s -> 4679.10s]  He's afraid of the cat.
[4679.10s -> 4679.74s]  He's afraid of the cat.
[4679.74s -> 4680.22s]  He's afraid of the cat.
[4680.22s -> 4680.70s]  He's afraid of the cat.
[4680.70s -> 4681.58s]  He's gonna fear cats.
[4681.58s -> 4682.57s]  Go on.
[4682.57s -> 4683.61s]  Pick a pretty picture.
[4683.61s -> 4684.33s]  Madame.
[4684.33s -> 4685.05s]  Definitely Madame.
[4685.61s -> 4688.06s]  We need Madame in there.
[4688.06s -> 4688.86s]  She said use her.
[4689.58s -> 4690.46s]  I think he's afraid of cats.
[4691.02s -> 4696.12s]  Cigarette?
[4696.12s -> 4698.28s]  I think I'm gonna use the cat.
[4698.84s -> 4700.56s]  Okay.
[4700.56s -> 4701.20s]  Now what else?
[4701.76s -> 4708.56s]  Which one of these is Monica?
[4708.56s -> 4710.40s]  Which one of these is Lena?
[4710.40s -> 4711.04s]  The shoe?
[4711.04s -> 4711.76s]  There is no shoe.
[4712.32s -> 4714.72s]  Cigarette?
[4716.09s -> 4716.59s]  Cigarette?
[4717.84s -> 4718.34s]  Or skull?
[4719.04s -> 4719.54s]  Cigarette?
[4720.70s -> 4721.02s]  All right.
[4721.02s -> 4721.98s]  We got one more choice here.
[4724.01s -> 4724.65s]  Left or right?
[4725.21s -> 4731.08s]  I don't know which one of these is who.
[4731.64s -> 4732.96s]  Skull?
[4733.50s -> 4738.64s]  Left, left, left, left, left, left, left, left, left, left.
[4739.20s -> 4739.94s]  Okay.
[4740.24s -> 4740.74s]  Let's do it.
[4741.36s -> 4746.38s]  Your move.
[4746.38s -> 4746.70s]  My move.
[4746.70s -> 4748.14s]  Try to be interesting.
[4748.14s -> 4748.46s]  Okay.
[4748.46s -> 4749.98s]  So cigarette versus...
[4750.78s -> 4752.30s]  Cat versus cigarette.
[4752.30s -> 4752.70s]  No.
[4752.70s -> 4754.94s]  Cat smoke cigarette versus doll.
[4758.84s -> 4759.80s]  Cigarette versus...
[4760.60s -> 4761.10s]  Uh...
[4762.91s -> 4763.39s]  Shoe.
[4763.39s -> 4764.03s]  There's no shoe.
[4765.44s -> 4767.20s]  You want me to hum the Jeopardy theme?
[4768.00s -> 4769.36s]  Don't let the cat smoke.
[4769.36s -> 4769.86s]  I'm not.
[4771.48s -> 4773.00s]  Old woman to red square.
[4773.56s -> 4775.29s]  Okay.
[4775.29s -> 4776.81s]  Old woman to red square?
[4781.29s -> 4781.79s]  Yes.
[4784.91s -> 4785.41s]  Got it.
[4794.94s -> 4795.44s]  Good.
[4795.44s -> 4795.82s]  All right.
[4795.82s -> 4796.32s]  Good move.
[4799.04s -> 4799.54s]  No!
[4806.56s -> 4809.12s]  It means whatever I want it to mean.
[4809.12s -> 4809.62s]  Cat dead.
[4812.12s -> 4812.68s]  Uh-oh.
[4812.68s -> 4813.00s]  Okay.
[4813.00s -> 4813.56s]  Now we need...
[4815.18s -> 4815.82s]  Uh...
[4815.82s -> 4816.62s]  Cigarette ver...
[4816.62s -> 4817.12s]  Uh...
[4817.58s -> 4820.50s]  I don't know.
[4821.79s -> 4822.83s]  Old lady versus doll?
[4823.55s -> 4825.55s]  Or late girl versus doll?
[4825.55s -> 4826.59s]  Cigarette versus skull?
[4831.39s -> 4832.43s]  Cigarette versus skull.
[4834.33s -> 4834.65s]  Yes.
[4834.65s -> 4836.41s]  I would be paralyzed as well.
[4836.41s -> 4841.74s]  I'm just wondering who cares in all caps.
[4843.82s -> 4845.02s]  Cigarette on lady?
[4846.67s -> 4848.03s]  On cigarette on lady?
[4848.97s -> 4850.65s]  Oh, they canceled each other out.
[4850.65s -> 4851.15s]  Shit.
[4851.15s -> 4853.40s]  A lot of real estate for a landmine.
[4853.40s -> 4853.88s]  Okay.
[4853.88s -> 4854.38s]  Come on.
[4855.63s -> 4856.13s]  Come on.
[4857.63s -> 4858.13s]  Oh!
[4860.30s -> 4860.78s]  All right.
[4860.78s -> 4862.78s]  We got old lady versus doll.
[4862.78s -> 4864.59s]  This is all we can do.
[4864.59s -> 4865.39s]  This is it.
[4865.39s -> 4866.19s]  Come on.
[4867.44s -> 4867.94s]  Yes!
[4872.11s -> 4872.61s]  I win.
[4887.82s -> 4889.90s]  Why is he three feet tall?
[4893.02s -> 4893.52s]  Oh.
[4893.82s -> 4894.32s]  Oh.
[4897.44s -> 4897.94s]  Never mind.
[4911.58s -> 4911.90s]  Okay.
[4911.90s -> 4912.78s]  Conclusions.
[4912.78s -> 4913.28s]  Uh...
[4914.17s -> 4914.67s]  Oh.
[4914.83s -> 4915.33s]  Oh.
[4915.33s -> 4915.95s]  I got...
[4915.95s -> 4916.59s]  I know what...
[4916.59s -> 4917.71s]  I know what this is.
[4917.71s -> 4918.83s]  I get it now.
[4918.83s -> 4919.39s]  I get it.
[4919.39s -> 4920.51s]  These are all the endings.
[4920.51s -> 4923.47s]  That makes sense.
[4923.47s -> 4923.79s]  Sure.
[4923.79s -> 4925.31s]  Okay.
[4925.31s -> 4927.31s]  So we had double war last time.
[4927.31s -> 4927.55s]  Oh no.
[4927.55s -> 4928.83s]  What did we have last time?
[4928.83s -> 4936.45s]  The big kiss.
[4936.45s -> 4937.81s]  The grand slam.
[4937.81s -> 4938.85s]  No third chances.
[4940.50s -> 4941.54s]  Double war.
[4941.54s -> 4942.42s]  Maximum Eric.
[4947.20s -> 4949.57s]  Maximum Eric.
[4949.57s -> 4951.25s]  What's the big kiss?
[4951.25s -> 4954.93s]  I have no idea.
[4954.93s -> 4955.97s]  No shit, dude.
[4958.02s -> 4958.90s]  Is it that obvious?
[4959.87s -> 4961.31s]  We want Maximum Eric.
[4961.31s -> 4961.95s]  I want...
[4962.51s -> 4963.39s]  I don't know how to do that.
[4967.22s -> 4969.38s]  So this is the only walkthrough that I could really...
[4969.38s -> 4970.50s]  One of the walkthroughs that I found
[4971.46s -> 4973.62s]  gave like a bunch of just like random info
[4973.62s -> 4974.90s]  and then at the end says
[4974.90s -> 4976.02s]  for different endings,
[4976.02s -> 4977.54s]  you can try to play this game again.
[4977.54s -> 4980.58s]  Sorry if you find difficulty with this walkthrough.
[4980.58s -> 4981.70s]  And then that's it.
[4981.70s -> 4984.90s]  Who the fuck was gonna make a walkthrough for this game?
[4984.90s -> 4985.30s]  I can't...
[4985.30s -> 4985.62s]  I don't know.
[4985.62s -> 4989.38s]  I'm not gonna be able to get Maximum Eric.
[4989.38s -> 4989.78s]  Hold on.
[4989.78s -> 4990.42s]  All right.
[4990.42s -> 4993.78s]  Maximum Eric ending.
[4994.78s -> 4996.22s]  Psychic Detective.
[4996.70s -> 5002.75s]  Psychic Detective strategy guy.
[5005.34s -> 5006.06s]  I don't know.
[5006.06s -> 5007.10s]  Maximum Eric time.
[5007.66s -> 5008.30s]  YouTube it.
[5008.30s -> 5012.53s]  Nobody has this on YouTube.
[5012.53s -> 5013.89s]  Cheat code central.
[5013.89s -> 5018.22s]  Due to the interactive nature of this title,
[5018.22s -> 5019.74s]  there are many ways to complete the game.
[5019.74s -> 5022.14s]  The game can finish in one of several endings.
[5022.14s -> 5024.26s]  Although the following walkthrough
[5024.26s -> 5025.70s]  may not be the most optimal,
[5025.70s -> 5029.06s]  it does expose most of the major plot themes.
[5029.06s -> 5030.98s]  Note the solution branches at several points
[5030.98s -> 5032.66s]  in order to reach different endings.
[5032.66s -> 5033.22s]  Okay.
[5033.22s -> 5039.34s]  Hold on a minute.
[5039.34s -> 5044.32s]  So the Grand Slam solution is the best ending.
[5044.32s -> 5044.72s]  They go...
[5044.72s -> 5045.84s]  I think these are ranked
[5045.84s -> 5047.36s]  in how good of an ending they are.
[5049.33s -> 5050.21s]  If you want to know,
[5050.21s -> 5054.51s]  Moki's Playmate is you play the entire game
[5054.51s -> 5056.67s]  without making a single choice.
[5056.67s -> 5059.07s]  You just let it do whatever it's going to do.
[5059.07s -> 5063.42s]  That's how you get that ending.
[5063.42s -> 5066.22s]  So, I mean, I don't...
[5066.22s -> 5067.34s]  We wait at the...
[5067.34s -> 5069.18s]  We want to go back and just watch the whole thing
[5070.56s -> 5071.28s]  to see what happens.
[5075.52s -> 5076.32s]  Watch it again.
[5077.12s -> 5077.92s]  Okay.
[5077.92s -> 5078.24s]  All right.
[5078.24s -> 5078.80s]  Let's see.
[5078.80s -> 5080.56s]  Let's at least get the worst ending in the whole game.
[5080.56s -> 5081.20s]  Okay.
[5081.20s -> 5092.74s]  I'm seeing a lot more yeses than I see nos.
[5092.74s -> 5093.70s]  Look, you can't just write...
[5093.70s -> 5094.82s]  You can't just write...
[5094.82s -> 5095.30s]  Fuck off.
[5095.86s -> 5097.31s]  Do them all.
[5097.47s -> 5102.80s]  I'm not going to do them all.
[5102.80s -> 5103.36s]  All right.
[5104.08s -> 5105.36s]  What's the Village Idiot?
[5105.36s -> 5105.76s]  Hold on.
[5110.61s -> 5115.42s]  Maximum Eric solution.
[5115.42s -> 5120.32s]  Hold on.
[5120.32s -> 5123.28s]  Yeah, that's real specific shit
[5123.28s -> 5127.62s]  in a lot of these later endings.
[5127.62s -> 5128.10s]  No.
[5128.10s -> 5128.74s]  All right.
[5128.74s -> 5130.18s]  We're going to do the dogshit ending.
[5130.18s -> 5135.55s]  Who owns the secret room?
[5135.55s -> 5135.95s]  I don't know.
[5145.28s -> 5146.16s]  I'm just going to sit here back here
[5146.16s -> 5148.67s]  and drink some coffee and hang out.
[5148.67s -> 5150.43s]  Make us click the ending we want.
[5150.43s -> 5152.03s]  Guys, I can't even get the solutions
[5152.03s -> 5152.67s]  to these endings.
[5152.67s -> 5153.47s]  There's so many of them
[5153.47s -> 5155.31s]  and none of them have any guides.
[5155.31s -> 5156.43s]  And the game is such a mess
[5156.43s -> 5158.27s]  that I can't do them all.
[5160.26s -> 5160.82s]  Okay, here we go.
[5161.38s -> 5162.82s]  I am going to put the controller down.
[5162.82s -> 5163.94s]  I'm not going to touch anything.
[5163.94s -> 5164.42s]  See what happens.
[5169.57s -> 5169.97s]  Here we go.
[5177.84s -> 5179.36s]  That's my sister, Monica.
[5180.24s -> 5180.56s]  Cute.
[5181.52s -> 5182.56s]  Very cute.
[5182.56s -> 5184.00s]  Very weak and gullible.
[5184.56s -> 5185.76s]  Who's the plastic dress?
[5186.56s -> 5190.99s]  Maybe you can find out for me.
[5191.71s -> 5192.51s]  Thank you for streaming.
[5192.51s -> 5193.23s]  You make a lot of...
[5193.23s -> 5193.71s]  And Tim.
[5193.71s -> 5194.21s]  Oh, thanks.
[5196.61s -> 5197.09s]  I don't know.
[5197.09s -> 5197.73s]  That's Moki, right?
[5198.93s -> 5204.59s]  There's money to be made.
[5204.59s -> 5205.71s]  He smells it.
[5205.71s -> 5207.25s]  Keep an eye on him.
[5207.25s -> 5207.89s]  So I just don't...
[5207.89s -> 5208.69s]  And Monica.
[5208.69s -> 5209.25s]  ...pour it over.
[5209.25s -> 5210.61s]  I don't warg into anybody.
[5214.98s -> 5215.54s]  So what happens?
[5215.54s -> 5216.34s]  I just stand around?
[5226.29s -> 5227.49s]  Normal man ending.
[5229.01s -> 5229.73s]  Yeah, I'm just a guy.
[5238.13s -> 5238.77s]  We missed this part.
[5244.22s -> 5263.94s]  What a shitty game.
[5263.94s -> 5264.66s]  Holy...
[5264.66s -> 5265.62s]  Oh my God.
[5270.03s -> 5272.43s]  You made a board and don't have any rules?
[5272.43s -> 5273.87s]  And then you're selling it as a board game.
[5279.87s -> 5281.23s]  This lady had found her niche.
[5283.97s -> 5285.57s]  House party from hell.
[5285.57s -> 5287.41s]  Not even a decent bean dip.
[5287.41s -> 5288.93s]  I was getting itchy fingers.
[5288.93s -> 5290.45s]  I went fishing for knickknacks.
[5292.43s -> 5293.55s]  About nine steps up.
[5294.11s -> 5294.67s]  What'd you think?
[5295.47s -> 5296.51s]  I couldn't tell.
[5296.51s -> 5297.39s]  You keep moving.
[5298.03s -> 5299.07s]  Even when you trespass.
[5299.07s -> 5299.63s]  Yeah, I like...
[5299.63s -> 5300.83s]  I love a good bean dip, too.
[5300.83s -> 5302.51s]  Driving into our part of you is asleep.
[5302.51s -> 5304.59s]  Hey, no one does autopot like Eric Bach.
[5304.59s -> 5305.09s]  I do.
[5306.99s -> 5308.50s]  There he is again.
[5308.50s -> 5309.62s]  Still don't know him, huh?
[5311.33s -> 5313.49s]  Oh, just some greasy little man.
[5314.13s -> 5315.97s]  Not like you, my sweet boy.
[5315.97s -> 5316.85s]  That's who he's talking...
[5316.85s -> 5317.89s]  That's who she's talking about.
[5319.17s -> 5321.97s]  Felt like a good time to get acquainted with dad.
[5321.97s -> 5325.17s]  What worked in the pookaloo was bound to work around here.
[5325.81s -> 5330.85s]  The house had seen better days.
[5331.49s -> 5333.41s]  Better days, worse days.
[5333.41s -> 5335.41s]  It was just starting to give a big wet kiss.
[5335.41s -> 5338.21s]  Dude, when we get to the point where the guy dies in that room,
[5339.25s -> 5341.57s]  we're gonna get to see it this time.
[5341.57s -> 5360.88s]  There's a lot of shit here that we did not look at.
[5361.28s -> 5363.36s]  We just looked out the window and then ran down the stairs.
[5366.82s -> 5367.54s]  Ten to one.
[5368.50s -> 5371.38s]  Secbethpah meant confidential.
[5371.38s -> 5372.74s]  That sounded like a good time.
[5385.02s -> 5387.66s]  Didn't anybody crack a smile in this country?
[5387.66s -> 5389.50s]  Doesn't Moki show all these photos here?
[5389.50s -> 5391.58s]  Maybe this was Papa Scrapbook of golden memories.
[5392.22s -> 5394.86s]  So how come I had a full-on case of the ripple in the ions?
[5399.23s -> 5401.07s]  These people were running a game.
[5401.07s -> 5402.59s]  A game I couldn't quite see.
[5403.47s -> 5405.39s]  Yeah, remember Moki shows all these pictures?
[5406.75s -> 5407.71s]  He stole them from here.
[5408.43s -> 5416.74s]  Okay.
[5416.74s -> 5420.38s]  I got more than I bargained for.
[5420.38s -> 5422.54s]  Like sneaking into someone else's nightmare.
[5423.34s -> 5424.30s]  Feeling right at home.
[5424.30s -> 5426.54s]  What the fuck are these drawings?
[5427.26s -> 5428.14s]  Who drew these?
[5444.75s -> 5446.27s]  I must ask you to go.
[5447.07s -> 5448.83s]  Your uncle was a big noise.
[5448.83s -> 5450.43s]  A real player in the old country.
[5451.65s -> 5453.33s]  Paranormal espionage.
[5453.33s -> 5454.45s]  That's all I'm allowed to say.
[5455.09s -> 5458.37s]  But perhaps you would be interested in a little collectible.
[5459.17s -> 5461.81s]  Chester, he's shameless.
[5465.68s -> 5467.28s]  Maybe I was trying too hard.
[5467.84s -> 5470.32s]  Maybe I stubbed my brain on something.
[5470.32s -> 5471.60s]  Because I was hearing voices.
[5472.24s -> 5472.80s]  Big time.
[5474.32s -> 5475.20s]  That's right.
[5476.24s -> 5477.44s]  Come this way.
[5478.69s -> 5479.57s]  All the way.
[5481.31s -> 5483.47s]  Time to pay me a visit.
[5483.47s -> 5484.75s]  Weren't we in somebody else's head at this point?
[5485.47s -> 5487.25s]  Let's walk around in a circle.
[5491.78s -> 5493.44s]  I am Ikunos.
[5494.54s -> 5504.56s]  Madame Ikunos.
[5504.64s -> 5506.48s]  This was the tutorial that we missed.
[5507.20s -> 5512.34s]  Quite the spread.
[5513.06s -> 5514.99s]  We don't clean up after this lady.
[5514.99s -> 5517.15s]  She's got like five empty coffee containers.
[5517.79s -> 5518.11s]  Oh.
[5519.07s -> 5519.31s]  Well.
[5520.35s -> 5521.39s]  That's interesting.
[5521.39s -> 5521.87s]  Never mind.
[5521.87s -> 5522.91s]  I didn't say that.
[5522.91s -> 5528.69s]  The one with the gift, smell it.
[5529.25s -> 5529.49s]  Yeah.
[5530.21s -> 5532.13s]  You smell anything in here, you've got your own gift.
[5533.30s -> 5534.42s]  I made a mental note.
[5535.14s -> 5535.94s]  Be less amusing.
[5535.94s -> 5536.98s]  Did I say she smells?
[5536.98s -> 5538.18s]  Come and sit.
[5539.28s -> 5541.52s]  But not to touch the game.
[5542.32s -> 5543.20s]  It is bad.
[5543.84s -> 5545.98s]  The devil itself.
[5545.98s -> 5550.32s]  What happened?
[5550.32s -> 5550.96s]  I didn't touch anything.
[5550.96s -> 5551.68s]  Bravo.
[5552.80s -> 5555.50s]  A marvelous raw talent.
[5556.54s -> 5556.94s]  Thanks.
[5557.58s -> 5560.16s]  You cannot do this with everybody.
[5561.04s -> 5565.28s]  Only with another psychic mind can you explore and talk.
[5565.92s -> 5570.27s]  Or do the nasty things.
[5570.27s -> 5571.71s]  I think I'll take a rain check.
[5571.71s -> 5575.23s]  And only another psychic mind can show you.
[5576.03s -> 5577.23s]  She's trying to hit on me here?
[5578.03s -> 5585.52s]  And only some of us can, you know, do the sex in our heads.
[5585.52s -> 5586.48s]  I'm one of them.
[5587.12s -> 5587.92s]  I'm available.
[5588.80s -> 5592.10s]  There's only three people on earth that can do this.
[5592.10s -> 5593.92s]  How can you?
[5593.92s -> 5596.08s]  You think it is a big joke?
[5596.08s -> 5597.68s]  Playing with the power.
[5597.68s -> 5598.56s]  Oh, come on.
[5598.56s -> 5599.60s]  It's a living.
[5599.60s -> 5600.80s]  Mental sleight of hand.
[5600.80s -> 5602.08s]  It is more.
[5602.08s -> 5608.11s]  You are the only one who can stop him.
[5608.67s -> 5609.31s]  Stop who?
[5612.54s -> 5613.58s]  Where is Chad?
[5613.58s -> 5614.46s]  In the study.
[5615.02s -> 5615.90s]  Quickly.
[5615.90s -> 5616.46s]  Go to him.
[5622.13s -> 5623.01s]  Oh, no.
[5623.01s -> 5624.05s]  Chad's dead.
[5625.09s -> 5627.20s]  What happens if you don't touch anything, though?
[5627.20s -> 5628.72s]  You don't say anything or do anything deep sleep?
[5629.60s -> 5633.52s]  I'm assuming if you pick up the knife, everyone goes, he did it.
[5633.52s -> 5636.24s]  And you get arrested and you go to disc three automatically, right?
[5636.88s -> 5644.50s]  It didn't take a genius to play it out.
[5644.50s -> 5645.86s]  I was coming down.
[5645.86s -> 5647.06s]  She was going up.
[5647.06s -> 5649.38s]  The door prize was a hunk of blood pudding.
[5650.26s -> 5657.14s]  Time to go.
[5658.26s -> 5659.78s]  Chad sort of made a mess.
[5659.78s -> 5660.26s]  Let's go.
[5664.08s -> 5664.40s]  Okay.
[5665.04s -> 5666.08s]  Incoming disc two.
[5666.88s -> 5671.66s]  This is great.
[5672.30s -> 5675.33s]  I'm going to hold on to this one.
[5675.33s -> 5677.25s]  I'm going to keep this in a glass case.
[5677.97s -> 5683.78s]  I'm going to hand down psychic detective to my grandchildren.
[5683.78s -> 5684.34s]  Oh, shit.
[5684.34s -> 5686.02s]  Was that just two or just three?
[5686.02s -> 5687.12s]  No, we're good.
[5687.68s -> 5695.30s]  Green vented.
[5696.70s -> 5697.66s]  Oh, I see what you're doing.
[5698.53s -> 5699.17s]  I see what you're doing.
[5700.03s -> 5700.83s]  I kind of get it.
[5701.39s -> 5702.03s]  Although I don't.
[5702.77s -> 5706.05s]  You know, I watch people stream among us and I have absolutely no idea what's going on.
[5706.05s -> 5707.57s]  I just kind of pretend like I do.
[5708.61s -> 5710.05s]  And then they just all start yelling at each other.
[5710.05s -> 5712.45s]  I sat there knowing two things dead certain.
[5712.45s -> 5717.97s]  Layne was going to drag me in deeper and I was going to follow like some over sex schnauzer.
[5722.88s -> 5723.52s]  What's that mean?
[5724.40s -> 5725.92s]  It means stop it.
[5726.56s -> 5726.88s]  All right.
[5726.88s -> 5732.88s]  This may sound like your dad really did jump out the window, but not exactly suicide.
[5732.88s -> 5734.16s]  He's still playing this.
[5734.16s -> 5735.28s]  Well, actually, I don't know.
[5735.28s -> 5735.68s]  You're wrong.
[5735.68s -> 5736.88s]  Someone was messing with his head.
[5736.88s -> 5738.40s]  I'm not playing this at all.
[5738.40s -> 5740.72s]  Actually, I'm sitting here without the controller in my hand.
[5740.72s -> 5741.22s]  What's that?
[5742.29s -> 5745.56s]  Um, well, you know that he's dead.
[5746.28s -> 5747.88s]  I'm still trying to get used to it.
[5748.60s -> 5749.24s]  Yeah, right.
[5749.96s -> 5751.48s]  You sure look busted up about it.
[5753.84s -> 5755.28s]  This ending is going to suck, too.
[5755.28s -> 5756.96s]  It's not going to be worth doing this a third time.
[5756.96s -> 5758.00s]  Watch, Monica.
[5758.00s -> 5758.88s]  Just a little more.
[5759.52s -> 5761.76s]  I do not trust this mirage quest.
[5762.56s -> 5763.20s]  You're going?
[5764.31s -> 5765.03s]  I have to.
[5765.59s -> 5766.47s]  Don't ask why.
[5767.51s -> 5768.87s]  Just hate me if you must.
[5769.91s -> 5773.67s]  What's that face I can do?
[5773.67s -> 5774.79s]  I can do like a sad face.
[5774.79s -> 5776.07s]  I can do a sad reaction.
[5776.71s -> 5777.19s]  I missed that.
[5777.99s -> 5779.59s]  Oh, I would have done the sad reaction.
[5779.59s -> 5780.71s]  Oh, you idiot.
[5780.71s -> 5782.47s]  How come I never thought about going home?
[5787.68s -> 5788.72s]  Wait, do I go home?
[5794.36s -> 5795.16s]  Hey, bright boy.
[5795.80s -> 5796.92s]  Want to get arrested?
[5796.92s -> 5798.44s]  Go sit in the cop car.
[5798.44s -> 5799.08s]  How are you?
[5799.64s -> 5801.08s]  Moki found dead.
[5802.63s -> 5803.75s]  You're that psychic kid.
[5803.75s -> 5804.47s]  Flasho.
[5804.47s -> 5805.67s]  Flash in the pan.
[5805.67s -> 5807.27s]  I've seen the act.
[5807.27s -> 5808.39s]  Moki's plaything.
[5808.39s -> 5810.31s]  To my pal, Moki.
[5810.87s -> 5812.15s]  Listen, you little putz.
[5812.15s -> 5813.35s]  You're flying blind.
[5813.35s -> 5814.63s]  You need Moki.
[5814.63s -> 5816.15s]  Moki knows the dirt.
[5816.71s -> 5817.67s]  I collected.
[5817.67s -> 5819.35s]  Stored in my cheeks.
[5819.35s -> 5820.63s]  That would explain the breath.
[5821.35s -> 5823.51s]  Listen, you do me a little job.
[5823.51s -> 5824.23s]  I clue you in.
[5824.23s -> 5825.83s]  We also could have followed Monica, too.
[5825.83s -> 5826.95s]  That could have been interesting.
[5826.95s -> 5828.15s]  Time's a-wasting.
[5830.48s -> 5833.24s]  It's a midnight sale.
[5833.24s -> 5835.64s]  Come on, now's the time, Foxy.
[5835.64s -> 5836.52s]  Take it or leave it.
[5838.88s -> 5840.48s]  Two exotic bombshells.
[5840.48s -> 5841.44s]  I end up with you.
[5841.44s -> 5842.48s]  Hey, kid.
[5842.48s -> 5843.92s]  You haven't seen me dance.
[5844.64s -> 5849.72s]  You know how they pronounce it?
[5851.48s -> 5851.98s]  Frick.
[5853.72s -> 5854.92s]  What assholes.
[5854.92s -> 5855.42s]  So?
[5855.42s -> 5857.48s]  So, history lesson.
[5857.48s -> 5860.76s]  The Black Diamond Campfire Girls.
[5860.76s -> 5862.68s]  Circa 1987.
[5863.80s -> 5865.48s]  It's the Resident Evil 7 family.
[5865.48s -> 5866.68s]  Vladimir Potsok.
[5866.68s -> 5868.95s]  The KGB kissed his ass.
[5868.95s -> 5869.91s]  Like it was sable.
[5869.91s -> 5870.79s]  Know why?
[5870.79s -> 5872.20s]  He made a little toy.
[5873.08s -> 5875.16s]  The Psychic Collector.
[5878.93s -> 5880.05s]  Lil' Lena.
[5880.05s -> 5882.53s]  Damn good psychic.
[5882.53s -> 5885.33s]  But a skitzy broad with a psychopathic papa.
[5885.33s -> 5886.53s]  Boo hoo.
[5886.61s -> 5887.81s]  And a Slasnewitz.
[5887.81s -> 5888.85s]  Eight years old.
[5888.85s -> 5891.41s]  She boils a cup of tea by looking at him.
[5892.69s -> 5893.57s]  Batting clean up.
[5894.29s -> 5895.97s]  Lexi Golitsyn.
[5895.97s -> 5896.85s]  Power hungry.
[5896.85s -> 5897.89s]  Perk hungry.
[5897.89s -> 5898.37s]  Borscht.
[5898.37s -> 5899.89s]  Turn myself into Moki.
[5899.89s -> 5901.41s]  Morty, I'm Moki.
[5901.41s -> 5902.53s]  I'm Moki, Morty.
[5902.53s -> 5903.25s]  Sergei Zansko.
[5903.25s -> 5905.62s]  Your rival.
[5905.62s -> 5906.82s]  It's not even funny.
[5907.62s -> 5908.74s]  I'm laughing at it, though.
[5908.74s -> 5909.38s]  I don't know why.
[5909.38s -> 5911.22s]  Because this makes no fucking sense,
[5911.22s -> 5911.78s]  what you just said.
[5911.78s -> 5912.34s]  Double the pain.
[5912.34s -> 5913.83s]  Who's all for?
[5913.83s -> 5918.84s]  We're talking frontal lobe trauma.
[5919.48s -> 5921.64s]  I turned myself into Moki, Morty.
[5921.64s -> 5922.68s]  Here's the key.
[5922.68s -> 5926.76s]  Do piggyback inside and get to Max Mirage's table.
[5926.76s -> 5928.36s]  Main room, far left corner.
[5928.36s -> 5929.40s]  Maybe we go in.
[5929.40s -> 5930.68s]  It's not like I use a map.
[5931.68s -> 5933.36s]  Hey, I wouldn't know.
[5933.36s -> 5934.24s]  I'm not psychic.
[5934.24s -> 5935.84s]  I don't have the sexy gift.
[5935.84s -> 5938.00s]  I just come from a clean straight shot home
[5938.00s -> 5939.12s]  where nobody mess me up.
[5939.84s -> 5940.96s]  What's that supposed to mean?
[5941.68s -> 5943.52s]  It means I know things.
[5944.56s -> 5945.20s]  As usual.
[5947.04s -> 5947.92s]  Moki, Andy.
[5948.93s -> 5949.41s]  That's fine.
[5950.68s -> 5951.00s]  Yeah, sure.
[5951.00s -> 5953.16s]  There's a phone call coming in two minutes.
[5954.12s -> 5955.08s]  Be there for it.
[5955.08s -> 5956.68s]  And don't screw me.
[5962.32s -> 5965.70s]  No, I don't even go in.
[5965.70s -> 5966.58s]  Psychic bastard.
[5966.58s -> 5967.06s]  Where are you?
[5967.70s -> 5968.18s]  Inside?
[5968.98s -> 5970.02s]  Have we crossed the room?
[5970.58s -> 5973.91s]  Here we go, kid.
[5976.96s -> 5978.16s]  It's the same path.
[5978.16s -> 5979.28s]  Yeah, it is the same path.
[5983.28s -> 5985.89s]  It's the same run.
[5990.02s -> 5992.58s]  Are you telling me that me actively playing the game
[5992.58s -> 5996.98s]  versus the game playing itself is just as bad?
[5998.58s -> 6000.02s]  That seems fucking impossible.
[6000.02s -> 6001.14s]  Yeah, I'm with you.
[6001.14s -> 6003.32s]  Let's hear it.
[6003.32s -> 6004.52s]  You put the fear of God in him.
[6004.52s -> 6005.88s]  Oh, for real?
[6005.88s -> 6007.24s]  White as a ghost, Moke.
[6007.24s -> 6008.76s]  Anyone hear him talking roosties?
[6008.76s -> 6009.96s]  Just the whole damn room.
[6010.68s -> 6011.88s]  You're a lying little punk.
[6012.76s -> 6014.60s]  Maybe I couldn't get there in time.
[6014.60s -> 6016.28s]  Maybe you're full of crap.
[6017.08s -> 6019.88s]  Why don't you go peep the psychic slot?
[6019.88s -> 6021.88s]  Why would this be Moki's playthrough?
[6021.88s -> 6023.24s]  Or Moki's plaything?
[6023.32s -> 6025.72s]  If we don't do what he wants and he gets angry and runs away.
[6025.72s -> 6028.44s]  If you're thinking of taking a ride in my head.
[6038.12s -> 6038.92s]  Eight, four, eight.
[6039.64s -> 6040.12s]  There it is.
[6041.19s -> 6043.11s]  Okay, this part, I'm really...
[6043.11s -> 6044.79s]  I need to see what really happens here.
[6044.79s -> 6045.43s]  Pizza!
[6045.43s -> 6047.94s]  We know when you're hungry.
[6047.94s -> 6050.42s]  This dude is the guy that walks over with his hands on his chest,
[6050.42s -> 6051.94s]  blood everywhere and the guy with the gun.
[6051.94s -> 6053.30s]  We keep missing this part.
[6053.86s -> 6054.90s]  Not this time.
[6054.90s -> 6056.90s]  Watch, Monica.
[6056.90s -> 6064.58s]  Learn everything, Eric.
[6064.58s -> 6065.30s]  Everything!
[6066.72s -> 6067.76s]  Say something!
[6067.76s -> 6068.08s]  Was that...
[6068.08s -> 6069.76s]  Was there a hand over there?
[6069.76s -> 6070.56s]  I quit.
[6070.56s -> 6071.60s]  I could put a puncher?
[6071.60s -> 6073.04s]  What the fuck was that?
[6073.04s -> 6074.72s]  On principle, of course.
[6074.72s -> 6076.00s]  Not because you're running away.
[6076.56s -> 6077.76s]  Oh, you think I'm scared?
[6078.40s -> 6080.82s]  You feel it.
[6080.82s -> 6081.94s]  Even when you touch.
[6082.74s -> 6085.65s]  Just before the flash, it's there.
[6086.53s -> 6089.72s]  What happens if I don't come back?
[6090.68s -> 6092.68s]  Or what happens if I come back like this?
[6093.40s -> 6102.40s]  Don't touch anything, don't touch anything.
[6106.24s -> 6107.52s]  My father made this.
[6109.03s -> 6111.03s]  Not to teach or to feel better.
[6111.99s -> 6113.91s]  But to destroy my Sergey.
[6113.91s -> 6114.95s]  From inside out.
[6115.99s -> 6117.11s]  And you want me to use it?
[6119.88s -> 6121.00s]  You will come back.
[6121.00s -> 6122.69s]  You are the best I've seen.
[6125.92s -> 6126.88s]  Okay, so now...
[6128.72s -> 6129.44s]  No!
[6129.44s -> 6130.08s]  No, no, no.
[6130.08s -> 6130.88s]  I didn't do anything.
[6130.88s -> 6131.28s]  Why is it...
[6133.25s -> 6134.05s]  I didn't do anything.
[6134.61s -> 6138.07s]  It's not going to come back with him walking in with blood all over him, is it?
[6138.07s -> 6143.57s]  It's going to open.
[6150.47s -> 6151.11s]  No, it's not.
[6151.11s -> 6151.51s]  It's not.
[6154.00s -> 6154.96s]  Okay, don't do anything.
[6169.62s -> 6171.06s]  I want to see what's happening to him.
[6182.90s -> 6184.69s]  You must have...
[6184.69s -> 6185.17s]  Get out!
[6185.17s -> 6188.16s]  You don't know what you say.
[6188.80s -> 6194.21s]  You cannot hear him.
[6194.21s -> 6195.49s]  You cannot protect.
[6195.49s -> 6196.81s]  Dracula.
[6196.81s -> 6197.67s]  You won't accept.
[6199.03s -> 6202.80s]  Dracula.
[6202.80s -> 6203.52s]  I miss him.
[6208.69s -> 6210.20s]  Stop it.
[6210.66s -> 6212.56s]  You will be adult.
[6212.56s -> 6213.44s]  You will be...
[6213.44s -> 6216.13s]  She's going to get...
[6216.13s -> 6217.01s]  She's going to get the last...
[6218.05s -> 6225.04s]  Okay, we're good.
[6225.04s -> 6226.32s]  Now let's see what happens here.
[6227.84s -> 6234.16s]  It can't be changed.
[6234.88s -> 6236.08s]  You can't change it.
[6237.96s -> 6238.92s]  Maybe you could have...
[6238.92s -> 6241.24s]  Maybe you could have gone back and seen what they were doing, but...
[6243.16s -> 6247.22s]  You have the right to remain silent.
[6247.22s -> 6248.42s]  You have the right to an attorney.
[6248.42s -> 6252.76s]  Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law.
[6252.76s -> 6253.26s]  Fine.
[6253.80s -> 6254.84s]  Lock me in my cell.
[6255.40s -> 6257.24s]  I sure as hell couldn't keep me in my body.
[6258.20s -> 6260.20s]  You could have switched to that guy's POV.
[6261.72s -> 6268.63s]  It's not going to be the same ending.
[6268.63s -> 6270.07s]  It's going to be impossible to be the same ending.
[6270.88s -> 6272.72s]  How long have you known Chad Kwiatkowski?
[6272.72s -> 6274.24s]  Why delaying a one-year at the house?
[6274.24s -> 6275.20s]  You boffing a kid?
[6275.20s -> 6276.32s]  You want to be boffing us?
[6276.32s -> 6277.92s]  What kind of game is she running?
[6277.92s -> 6279.76s]  She's looking for a psychic collector.
[6280.32s -> 6282.42s]  A whole bunch of people are looking for her.
[6282.42s -> 6283.30s]  Her dad made him.
[6283.30s -> 6284.02s]  Four of them.
[6284.26s -> 6285.38s]  They're unbelievable.
[6285.38s -> 6287.94s]  Sounded like some crystal-hugging hophead.
[6287.94s -> 6289.06s]  You wouldn't believe what can happen.
[6289.88s -> 6291.64s]  Guys, I know this is hard to believe, but...
[6291.64s -> 6293.48s]  There was only one way to slip this.
[6294.20s -> 6295.96s]  Find this damn collector myself.
[6297.94s -> 6300.50s]  I didn't even notice that face that got in leftist making.
[6300.50s -> 6307.41s]  All right, here we go.
[6307.41s -> 6308.69s]  It's time for the conclusion.
[6309.49s -> 6311.33s]  They're not pressing a single button.
[6311.33s -> 6319.52s]  If we get the same ending, I'm going to be very, very mad.
[6320.08s -> 6324.05s]  That would be upsetting to me.
[6324.05s -> 6336.77s]  All right, I got the worst ending on my own.
[6337.72s -> 6339.08s]  I don't think that was the worst ending.
[6339.08s -> 6340.68s]  I think it was a bad one, but not the worst one.
[6341.24s -> 6351.04s]  Hey, Fox.
[6351.04s -> 6353.20s]  Be a good boy.
[6353.20s -> 6354.40s]  No eight-dimension crap.
[6358.08s -> 6361.41s]  Go to Bagman.
[6362.05s -> 6362.79s]  I'll be honest.
[6362.79s -> 6367.00s]  I don't even know how I got to Bagman in the first place.
[6367.00s -> 6370.66s]  What is this dork cube, Link?
[6371.30s -> 6374.24s]  What the hell is dork cube?
[6374.24s -> 6379.30s]  I was sick to death of trespassing, head-hopping, trance, being.
[6379.30s -> 6382.74s]  I needed time to think, to figure out what I do next.
[6382.74s -> 6384.26s]  I'm not doing the feet thing right there.
[6384.26s -> 6384.76s]  No.
[6391.83s -> 6393.91s]  Mayor Patterson answered allegations
[6393.91s -> 6397.67s]  that the murders may have been motivated by anti-Corellian sentiment.
[6397.67s -> 6399.91s]  You won the black diamonds game last time.
[6399.91s -> 6401.75s]  That's the only thing that made it a good ending.
[6403.24s -> 6404.60s]  You got the worst good ending.
[6419.32s -> 6419.80s]  Hold on.
[6419.80s -> 6420.36s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[6433.91s -> 6434.41s]  Great.
[6435.56s -> 6436.06s]  Great.
[6436.44s -> 6437.32s]  Very cool, Link.
[6441.48s -> 6442.76s]  Crashing the website.
[6445.72s -> 6449.08s]  Well, when like 6,000 people click on something at the same time,
[6449.64s -> 6451.72s]  I'm going to assume it's not going to go very well.
[6465.54s -> 6466.34s]  It's so weird because when you...
[6468.74s -> 6469.54s]  Here's something weird.
[6470.18s -> 6473.22s]  Your teeth make up a huge amount of the way that you look.
[6475.06s -> 6476.18s]  That doesn't even look like me.
[6476.18s -> 6477.62s]  It's because the teeth are different.
[6477.62s -> 6478.98s]  It looks like a different fucking person.
[6481.54s -> 6482.66s]  Like that fake mouth.
[6483.30s -> 6484.02s]  It's just...
[6484.02s -> 6485.06s]  I am a different person.
[6500.62s -> 6501.66s]  New viewer.
[6501.66s -> 6516.90s]  I remember going to places like...
[6517.54s -> 6519.62s]  Because you guys know what Cold Stone is, right?
[6522.81s -> 6526.25s]  Cold Stone Creamery did this thing where anytime you got a tip,
[6526.81s -> 6528.79s]  and if you tipped anybody from Cold Stone,
[6528.79s -> 6530.39s]  they would have to sing this tip song.
[6531.45s -> 6532.65s]  And I remember always just thinking like,
[6532.65s -> 6533.53s]  they don't want...
[6533.53s -> 6535.69s]  Hey guys, we got a tip.
[6535.69s -> 6539.13s]  A tip just came in and we're really hip.
[6539.13s -> 6540.33s]  And then you could just tell it was like,
[6540.33s -> 6541.61s]  I don't want to fucking sing that.
[6541.61s -> 6542.33s]  So I would just...
[6542.33s -> 6543.69s]  I would put money in and be like,
[6543.69s -> 6544.41s]  you don't have to.
[6544.41s -> 6545.13s]  Just give it...
[6545.93s -> 6546.65s]  You don't have to do it.
[6546.65s -> 6547.77s]  I'm just going to say you did.
[6547.77s -> 6548.81s]  Yeah, I know you don't want to.
[6548.81s -> 6549.53s]  You don't have to.
[6549.61s -> 6550.49s]  You look disappointed.
[6551.05s -> 6553.29s]  Something for a pony or maybe a blonde.
[6554.74s -> 6556.18s]  I got a real job for you.
[6556.18s -> 6556.82s]  A real gimme.
[6556.82s -> 6558.66s]  A thousand bucks and 30 minutes.
[6558.66s -> 6559.62s]  Doing what?
[6559.62s -> 6561.54s]  Sort of psychic seal of approval.
[6561.54s -> 6562.74s]  If they wanted to, sure.
[6562.74s -> 6564.26s]  I would sit there and fold my arms and be like,
[6564.26s -> 6564.90s]  let me hear it.
[6564.90s -> 6566.02s]  Come on, kid.
[6566.02s -> 6566.98s]  Clock's a ticking.
[6570.07s -> 6570.87s]  My pal!
[6570.87s -> 6571.67s]  I thought he just ran away.
[6571.67s -> 6574.18s]  You just want to use the damn thing.
[6574.18s -> 6576.02s]  Kid, this is white odd.
[6576.02s -> 6577.86s]  We snag a collector.
[6577.86s -> 6579.06s]  We're big league.
[6579.06s -> 6580.02s]  Psychic mercenaries.
[6580.02s -> 6581.54s]  You with the brain, me with the Rolodex.
[6581.54s -> 6583.06s]  In the bit song.
[6583.06s -> 6583.94s]  The hell it does.
[6583.94s -> 6585.78s]  I shelled out cash four years ago.
[6585.78s -> 6586.50s]  So you say.
[6587.22s -> 6588.74s]  Don't you get it?
[6588.74s -> 6591.14s]  Lexi never died.
[6591.14s -> 6594.18s]  A face job and a lounge act worse than yours.
[6594.82s -> 6595.86s]  Max Mirage?
[6595.86s -> 6597.22s]  No, Wayne Newton.
[6597.22s -> 6598.26s]  Come on, kid.
[6598.26s -> 6599.14s]  Get with the beat.
[6599.14s -> 6600.18s]  Yes, he does have a rat's head.
[6600.18s -> 6600.58s]  Yes, he does.
[6601.30s -> 6603.16s]  Okay, here we go.
[6603.72s -> 6606.62s]  This is it.
[6607.18s -> 6608.46s]  This is where it's going to...
[6608.46s -> 6610.22s]  The path is going to branch here at this point
[6610.22s -> 6610.94s]  because I'm not going to run.
[6610.94s -> 6611.74s]  Don't say it.
[6611.74s -> 6614.12s]  What are you doing hanging around?
[6614.20s -> 6618.49s]  I could ask you the same question.
[6618.49s -> 6620.41s]  Strictly insurance.
[6620.41s -> 6622.57s]  Make sure you got the genuine goods.
[6624.38s -> 6625.90s]  No, I got to tame my ankles.
[6626.70s -> 6627.34s]  Let her rip.
[6639.38s -> 6639.94s]  Don't move.
[6647.83s -> 6649.03s]  The real thing?
[6649.03s -> 6649.67s]  Yeah.
[6649.67s -> 6650.79s]  Did the earth move?
[6652.31s -> 6653.35s]  Oh, man.
[6653.35s -> 6654.31s]  This is Bush League.
[6656.33s -> 6657.53s]  This is Bush League?
[6657.53s -> 6658.97s]  This wasn't the deal.
[6658.97s -> 6660.10s]  You're right.
[6660.10s -> 6661.06s]  I feel just...
[6670.30s -> 6671.34s]  Um.
[6671.34s -> 6675.64s]  Did she take his hairpiece off?
[6696.90s -> 6698.34s]  I'm your mommy now.
[6698.98s -> 6699.61s]  Okay.
[6717.13s -> 6718.25s]  Oh, hey, shit.
[6718.25s -> 6720.17s]  Monica, your car has got a lot of trash in it.
[6720.89s -> 6722.97s]  She does that thing when she freaks out.
[6722.97s -> 6725.21s]  She's like moving all the McDonald's and Wendy's bags
[6725.21s -> 6727.13s]  like deep into the bottom of the seat.
[6727.13s -> 6727.85s]  Like, fuck, fuck.
[6727.85s -> 6730.73s]  Ah, yeah, that's how I've been, you know, living out of my car.
[6730.73s -> 6731.77s]  You know, like we all do.
[6733.83s -> 6734.71s]  You just take your hand
[6734.71s -> 6736.39s]  and you drag it across the back seat
[6736.39s -> 6737.59s]  desperately trying to make room
[6737.59s -> 6738.55s]  and hope there's no stains.
[6747.54s -> 6748.50s]  What's wrong with me?
[6753.45s -> 6755.53s]  Think how you can train him.
[6755.53s -> 6756.49s]  Too much DMT?
[6762.30s -> 6767.19s]  You find the village idiot,
[6767.19s -> 6770.07s]  make a special delivery, and then maybe...
[6770.07s -> 6772.63s]  No, that's not the ending that I want.
[6777.88s -> 6792.10s]  Wait, did he just shoot the kid?
[6809.82s -> 6810.38s]  Take this.
[6811.61s -> 6812.89s]  Get the collector.
[6813.77s -> 6816.09s]  Challenge Lexi the game.
[6816.09s -> 6816.81s]  What do you mean, three?
[6816.81s -> 6817.53s]  Challenge the game?
[6817.53s -> 6818.81s]  He already blitzed me.
[6818.81s -> 6821.05s]  No, we cannot face him.
[6821.85s -> 6824.81s]  I've made you weak, but not so stupid.
[6825.69s -> 6830.38s]  Choose me.
[6830.38s -> 6833.19s]  I'm this guy.
[6833.19s -> 6834.07s]  Quickly.
[6834.07s -> 6836.66s]  Or he's destroyed.
[6838.76s -> 6839.24s]  No.
[6839.24s -> 6841.00s]  I leaned in so close for that.
[6841.80s -> 6842.60s]  I'm not a warrior.
[6842.60s -> 6843.24s]  Choose me.
[6843.24s -> 6844.76s]  I'm a freak of nature.
[6844.76s -> 6845.88s]  Choose me.
[6845.88s -> 6848.52s]  She pulls up from down below the frame,
[6848.52s -> 6850.84s]  an envelope with the fucking Smash logo on it.
[6850.84s -> 6851.80s]  This isn't Karelia.
[6851.80s -> 6852.84s]  You should run with the wolf.
[6855.32s -> 6855.96s]  Come with me.
[6856.68s -> 6858.44s]  We can take this thing to Mexico right now.
[6859.08s -> 6860.52s]  Start a new life, a new show.
[6861.08s -> 6863.00s]  I'll touch objects, you look real moody.
[6863.64s -> 6864.44s]  Why couldn't that work?
[6865.00s -> 6865.96s]  He's been listening.
[6871.13s -> 6871.69s]  She's in.
[6878.47s -> 6880.79s]  If I'm so weak, why would they make me come in here again?
[6880.79s -> 6886.39s]  Like, he already won.
[6886.39s -> 6890.44s]  I think it's time for the powerful, psychic old lady to have a try.
[6891.08s -> 6892.95s]  But her excuse was,
[6892.95s -> 6896.47s]  No, no, you're weak and terrible, and you suck.
[6897.35s -> 6899.99s]  But you do it again.
[6899.99s -> 6913.66s]  That's all I got from that.
[6913.66s -> 6915.75s]  Same ending and coming.
[6915.75s -> 6916.39s]  It can't be.
[6917.67s -> 6925.11s]  It actually cannot be the same ending.
[6925.11s -> 6926.79s]  Seven hundred dollar console, by the way.
[6926.79s -> 6930.26s]  Omega Lola wasn't that much money.
[6930.26s -> 6933.62s]  Although, like, I'll sell one to you if that's what you want to pay for it.
[6933.62s -> 6951.62s]  Karelia, so photogenic.
[6951.62s -> 6954.42s]  Why can't they all be full screen?
[6955.06s -> 6956.84s]  Why does it have to be in the tiny little window?
[6957.48s -> 6960.07s]  This doesn't even look bad.
[6960.07s -> 6962.15s]  Why does it have to put it so small?
[6962.87s -> 6967.22s]  Trouble in the rat hole.
[6967.22s -> 6968.71s]  Monica's up there.
[6969.43s -> 6970.07s]  Top floor.
[6970.63s -> 6973.22s]  What about Max?
[6974.02s -> 6975.22s]  He's waiting for us to make a move.
[6977.05s -> 6979.37s]  I guess you couldn't see the icons, huh?
[6980.33s -> 6981.45s]  Let's take him out.
[6981.45s -> 6982.90s]  I want to go.
[6982.90s -> 6983.54s]  Then go.
[6983.54s -> 6984.50s]  But I'm holding this.
[6987.10s -> 6988.14s]  I'm not going to get the same ending.
[7006.23s -> 7008.23s]  Is this a great country or?
[7008.23s -> 7010.81s]  Mirage quest.
[7010.81s -> 7011.93s]  What a scam.
[7011.93s -> 7015.85s]  You know, only in America could someone declare war on depression.
[7015.85s -> 7018.01s]  Depression is very important to Karelians.
[7018.01s -> 7020.25s]  It makes all that boredom seem somehow.
[7020.25s -> 7023.05s]  But did you say Karelians?
[7023.05s -> 7023.85s]  What was Superman?
[7023.85s -> 7025.13s]  A room full of sponge cake.
[7025.13s -> 7026.81s]  Every crumb in love with Lexi.
[7026.81s -> 7027.93s]  A humble beginning.
[7027.93s -> 7028.65s]  To what end?
[7029.29s -> 7030.81s]  Good seats at the ballpark.
[7030.81s -> 7032.33s]  Plank steak whenever I want.
[7032.33s -> 7032.81s]  Krypton.
[7032.81s -> 7034.41s]  Unlimited will wash your head.
[7034.41s -> 7034.89s]  What was he?
[7034.89s -> 7035.61s]  You're a mage.
[7035.61s -> 7038.17s]  Karelia on its knees.
[7038.17s -> 7038.65s]  Klingon.
[7038.65s -> 7039.29s]  No, no, no, no.
[7040.25s -> 7042.07s]  No, just a little.
[7046.62s -> 7047.98s]  So you've brought a toy.
[7048.70s -> 7049.58s]  You are prepared.
[7049.58s -> 7050.86s]  Superman was a Klingon.
[7051.98s -> 7052.54s]  Cold feet?
[7053.59s -> 7054.71s]  I'm not surprised.
[7055.75s -> 7056.71s]  A Kryptonian?
[7057.75s -> 7059.51s]  Hehehehehe.
[7060.86s -> 7062.22s]  Oh shit, this is getting weird.
[7062.94s -> 7076.84s]  Hehehehehe.
[7076.84s -> 7079.61s]  This is how you do it.
[7080.33s -> 7082.17s]  No wasted motion.
[7082.17s -> 7083.85s]  No parlor tricks.
[7084.65s -> 7086.17s]  Say goodbye to the girl.
[7086.90s -> 7087.62s]  Go to the car.
[7088.79s -> 7089.51s]  No.
[7089.51s -> 7091.38s]  Harder.
[7091.38s -> 7093.43s]  Don't you want to see her cry?
[7094.23s -> 7094.97s]  Hey.
[7094.97s -> 7095.77s]  You think I need your help?
[7096.49s -> 7097.69s]  You think I want you watching me?
[7097.69s -> 7103.38s]  You're a cheerleader, a throw rug. Now move! Go!
[7103.38s -> 7111.17s]  Good boy. That is good boy. Nobody wants to burn you.
[7111.17s -> 7116.47s]  Just bring me the toy. These are the good times.
[7116.47s -> 7119.48s]  Okay, hand it over.
[7120.91s -> 7122.22s]  It's a simple game, Rio.
[7122.22s -> 7125.22s]  I don't want to play the game though, but I don't touch anything.
[7125.22s -> 7132.58s]  I don't get it, how do I lose?
[7132.58s -> 7144.78s]  He is scared of the cat. That was a right call.
[7151.01s -> 7153.01s]  Which ones are stronger?
[7153.01s -> 7155.01s]  Alright, so now we lose. We have to lose this.
[7155.01s -> 7157.31s]  I don't want to accidentally win.
[7157.31s -> 7158.31s]  Alright, how about this one?
[7158.31s -> 7163.68s]  Take the bracelet, the doll, and red square.
[7163.68s -> 7166.68s]  And then, I don't know, this guy.
[7166.68s -> 7175.00s]  Okay, let's lose.
[7175.00s -> 7181.00s]  Okay, let's take the doll and put it over to cigarette.
[7181.00s -> 7187.65s]  I can tell which hidden the little bogeyman that scares you in the dark.
[7187.65s -> 7191.65s]  He works with me now. He tells me all your secrets.
[7191.65s -> 7193.40s]  Okay.
[7193.40s -> 7195.40s]  You're a little burnt up, aren't you?
[7195.40s -> 7197.40s]  As if I needed a handicap.
[7197.40s -> 7202.56s]  Cigarette on two. Alright, that's two in a row.
[7202.56s -> 7205.56s]  Terror feeds the gift. Terror makes you stronger.
[7205.56s -> 7211.17s]  And lets me pull you apart.
[7211.17s -> 7212.17s]  Not the same ending.
[7212.17s -> 7219.38s]  Okay, now we're going to do red square to lady, right?
[7219.38s -> 7221.38s]  Doesn't she destroy red square?
[7221.38s -> 7228.90s]  That one was particularly tasty.
[7228.90s -> 7230.90s]  The damn thing is rigged.
[7230.90s -> 7232.90s]  Well, take notes.
[7232.90s -> 7234.90s]  For some other lifetime.
[7234.90s -> 7240.78s]  Okay, time to lose.
[7240.78s -> 7241.78s]  Game over.
[7241.78s -> 7253.87s]  Yep, that's me.
[7253.87s -> 7256.87s]  The babbling idiot and his new best friend.
[7256.87s -> 7259.74s]  I want deep down.
[7259.74s -> 7262.74s]  You're still a little part of me that's really smart.
[7262.74s -> 7265.42s]  That knows what's going on.
[7265.42s -> 7266.42s]  Deep down.
[7266.42s -> 7267.42s]  Just doesn't get out much.
[7267.42s -> 7276.06s]  Did have that hair.
[7276.06s -> 7283.56s]  Yeah, that was really not worth watching the whole like 26 minute movie again.
[7283.56s -> 7287.76s]  To just say I want ice cream in jail.
[7287.76s -> 7291.98s]  It was not worth it at all, actually.
[7291.98s -> 7292.98s]  Wasn't even the right one.
[7292.98s -> 7294.98s]  Yeah, it was. It's Moki's Playmate.
[7294.98s -> 7301.15s]  You get that by not doing anything.
[7301.15s -> 7302.15s]  Alright, let's move on.
[7302.15s -> 7306.10s]  That was a meaty one though. I knew that was going to take at least a couple hours.
[7306.10s -> 7310.30s]  We're going to move on to...
[7310.30s -> 7314.53s]  We're in the 3D, I might as well stay on it.
[7314.53s -> 7316.53s]  We're going to play a game called I'm Mercenary.
[7316.53s -> 7321.07s]  Fucking Christ, finally.
[7321.07s -> 7330.38s]  Hey. Hey, come on, man.
[7330.38s -> 7332.38s]  Enemy Spider-Man? No, I'm Mercenary.
[7332.38s -> 7336.35s]  It looks pretty bizarre, but let's...
[7336.35s -> 7338.35s]  You know, we'll take a break too.
[7338.35s -> 7339.35s]  Just a quick one.
[7339.35s -> 7341.68s]  Let's go pee.
[7341.68s -> 7342.68s]  Grab a water.
[7342.68s -> 7345.43s]  And I'll be back in two minutes.
[7345.43s -> 7346.43s]  We're going to play I'm Mercenary.
[7346.43s -> 7348.57s]  In a sec.
[7348.57s -> 7571.06s]  Why are you all sleeping?
[7571.06s -> 7575.14s]  Why are you all sleeping?
[7575.14s -> 7578.02s]  Why are you all sleeping?
[7578.02s -> 7582.24s]  Okay, I'm Mercenary.
[7582.24s -> 7590.30s]  Probably should change the title to just retro.
[7590.30s -> 7594.42s]  Alright, let's go.
[7594.42s -> 7604.94s]  I have no idea how good this...
[7604.94s -> 7606.94s]  This game might be a fucking dud.
[7606.94s -> 7610.14s]  It looks wild.
[7610.14s -> 7611.96s]  So we'll find out.
[7611.96s -> 7621.37s]  A 3DO experience.
[7621.37s -> 7623.57s]  From Electro...
[7623.57s -> 7627.13s]  How much did EA have to do with this?
[7627.13s -> 7631.54s]  The games are exclusive EA games.
[7631.54s -> 7632.54s]  Did they make it?
[7632.54s -> 7634.54s]  Were they part of the process?
[7634.54s -> 7636.54s]  There's a lot of EA games.
[7636.54s -> 7637.54s]  Wake up.
[7637.54s -> 7650.24s]  Satellite Intercept.
[7650.24s -> 7651.24s]  Pick HQ.
[7651.24s -> 7654.53s]  Transmission.
[7654.53s -> 7661.74s]  This is in the sake of every generation to come.
[7661.74s -> 7664.98s]  Listen to me and behold your future.
[7664.98s -> 7668.98s]  After 10,000 years, I'm free.
[7668.98s -> 7671.98s]  It's time to conquer Earth.
[7671.98s -> 7675.60s]  Your children's children will become enslaved.
[7675.60s -> 7677.97s]  Forced to fight each other to the death.
[7677.97s -> 7680.97s]  Unless you listen to what I say.
[7680.97s -> 7682.97s]  I know what must be done.
[7682.97s -> 7685.97s]  But I am powerless to act on my own.
[7685.97s -> 7689.21s]  We must have a warrior from your time.
[7689.21s -> 7692.21s]  Someone outside this world we call perfect.
[7692.21s -> 7694.21s]  That person was just sleeping in a chair on the top left.
[7694.21s -> 7705.00s]  And must send us a warrior to destroy perfect.
[7705.00s -> 7707.00s]  Can you scroll it a little slower?
[7707.00s -> 7718.65s]  That's not me. That's not me.
[7718.65s -> 7728.12s]  Copyright 1995. You just took me out, man.
[7728.12s -> 7731.06s]  Leave the flatline thing there.
[7731.06s -> 7732.06s]  You just pulled me out.
[7732.06s -> 7737.12s]  New Jump.
[7737.12s -> 7741.32s]  Okay. All I can do is New Jump.
[7741.32s -> 7744.26s]  A211.
[7744.26s -> 7745.26s]  Near Little Rock.
[7745.26s -> 7746.50s]  Okay.
[7746.50s -> 7753.86s]  One of the Ghostbusters?
[7753.86s -> 7773.90s]  Why do they all have syringes?
[7773.90s -> 7777.29s]  We've got to pull him out.
[7777.29s -> 7788.14s]  No! I thought it was going to shatter.
[7788.14s -> 7795.54s]  That's actually what would happen if you got pulled out of the Matrix, by the way.
[7795.54s -> 7821.51s]  Help destruct?
[7821.51s -> 7823.51s]  It's the guy.
[7823.51s -> 7825.51s]  All these tales. Could it be?
[7825.51s -> 7828.51s]  It's going to be that guy from the Unsolved Mysteries thing.
[7828.51s -> 7831.39s]  Some of these are fiction. Some of these are fact.
[7831.39s -> 7833.39s]  Can you find out which one?
[7833.39s -> 7836.91s]  In crazy stories.
[7836.91s -> 7846.26s]  This one. This one was real.
[7846.26s -> 7848.26s]  I know. Real fucked up, I know.
[7848.26s -> 7850.26s]  This is all we got from Thor.
[7850.26s -> 7865.15s]  Jonathan Breaks. Yes.
[7865.15s -> 7874.24s]  The day to analyze it quick.
[7874.24s -> 7884.48s]  I don't think I want to go into that.
[7884.48s -> 7886.48s]  It's clearly just a dentist's chair.
[7886.48s -> 7888.85s]  No, it's a barber's chair.
[7888.85s -> 7893.97s]  With a headband on it.
[7893.97s -> 7906.64s]  A gamer coffin.
[7906.64s -> 7908.64s]  We haven't determined what happened yet.
[7908.64s -> 7911.20s]  But be careful in this area.
[7911.20s -> 7913.50s]  This is where we lost contact with number four.
[7913.50s -> 7917.50s]  Sorry, I think somebody may have hit the side of the TV with a hammer.
[7917.50s -> 7919.50s]  I think they're ready whenever you are.
[7919.50s -> 7921.50s]  So you can't really tell what the hell is going on here.
[7921.50s -> 7925.34s]  Neither can I.
[7925.34s -> 7927.34s]  Approaching synchronization now.
[7927.34s -> 7929.97s]  Waveform sync.
[7929.97s -> 7932.27s]  Check. Interference pattern.
[7932.27s -> 7934.27s]  0.5 milliseconds.
[7934.27s -> 7936.27s]  Forward.
[7936.27s -> 7938.27s]  Going in. Ready to link.
[7938.27s -> 7940.27s]  Jump in. Three. Two.
[7940.27s -> 7942.45s]  One. Let's go.
[7942.45s -> 7960.29s]  Are we in?
[7960.29s -> 7965.92s]  This is what it feels like to be in an MRI.
[7965.92s -> 7968.99s]  What the hell is going on? Gamer?
[7968.99s -> 7976.22s]  This is not what I thought
[7976.22s -> 7978.22s]  this was going to be.
[7978.22s -> 7980.22s]  Enter the playground.
[7980.22s -> 7987.20s]  Falcon.
[7987.20s -> 7989.20s]  It really is just a game. It's just a video warning.
[7989.20s -> 7991.20s]  Low defense. Red spire required.
[7991.20s -> 7993.82s]  Are these teammates?
[7993.82s -> 8004.56s]  Am I out of ammo?
[8004.56s -> 8009.04s]  Dude, it's a battle royale.
[8009.04s -> 8011.73s]  Wait a minute. What am I going to go?
[8019.01s -> 8021.01s]  I spent all the money on the
[8021.01s -> 8023.76s]  elaborate intro.
[8023.76s -> 8027.54s]  Touch this? I just picked that person up.
[8027.54s -> 8031.76s]  I think we're capping the point.
[8037.78s -> 8042.00s]  What's this? D.
[8042.00s -> 8044.00s]  O. A. What is that up there?
[8044.00s -> 8050.78s]  I killed that person.
[8050.78s -> 8052.78s]  I'm rank 255.
[8052.78s -> 8057.71s]  I need to go find a red spire.
[8057.71s -> 8062.83s]  Okay. Let's go.
[8062.83s -> 8065.58s]  This is a blue spire. It's not what I want.
[8065.58s -> 8072.88s]  Red spire. Is it on the map?
[8072.88s -> 8076.98s]  No. It's blue. Blue?
[8076.98s -> 8079.28s]  Also blue?
[8079.28s -> 8083.70s]  I think I passed out.
[8083.70s -> 8086.38s]  Rank...
[8096.38s -> 8098.38s]  I don't know what he said.
[8098.38s -> 8100.38s]  This is the type of game that you would see in a
[8100.38s -> 8102.82s]  Mountain Dew commercial.
[8108.70s -> 8110.70s]  It's like a game that you would see
[8110.70s -> 8112.70s]  on the background of a
[8112.70s -> 8114.70s]  TV show tries to show you what a
[8114.70s -> 8124.50s]  video game is.
[8124.50s -> 8128.02s]  I'm going back in.
[8128.02s -> 8130.02s]  Total jumps. Rank 255.
[8130.02s -> 8132.77s]  Defense, offense, and agility.
[8132.77s -> 8134.77s]  Ammo algorithms.
[8134.77s -> 8138.80s]  Agility is green.
[8138.80s -> 8140.98s]  Offense is red.
[8140.98s -> 8142.98s]  Defense is yellow.
[8142.98s -> 8148.29s]  Effectiveness is 34%.
[8148.29s -> 8155.76s]  Let's jump.
[8155.76s -> 8160.56s]  Mountain Dew commercial.
[8160.56s -> 8162.56s]  Would you be the test subject
[8162.56s -> 8165.06s]  back in the mid-90s
[8165.06s -> 8167.06s]  to play a game like that if you got to be
[8167.06s -> 8169.87s]  in VR for like 10 minutes?
[8169.87s -> 8175.95s]  Let's see if I can figure this out.
[8175.95s -> 8177.95s]  That Mountain Dew commercial the whole time would be like
[8177.95s -> 8179.95s]  with two
[8179.95s -> 8181.95s]  top boxes you can level up.
[8181.95s -> 8186.88s]  If you send in five labels
[8186.88s -> 8188.88s]  you'll get 200 XP
[8188.88s -> 8195.54s]  points.
[8195.54s -> 8198.16s]  Take your game to the next level.
[8198.16s -> 8200.16s]  And the person has a huge fucking headset on.
[8200.16s -> 8202.16s]  They always just have a gigantic headset on.
[8202.16s -> 8204.16s]  And they like put their hands in the air and they scream
[8204.16s -> 8210.82s]  yeah. Alright I'm in yellow right now.
[8210.82s -> 8212.82s]  Should I just hold it? Just hold this?
[8212.82s -> 8223.49s]  Red. The music's not bad.
[8223.49s -> 8227.52s]  No it's not. It's alright.
[8227.52s -> 8236.98s]  Alright red. The bars are going up.
[8236.98s -> 8238.98s]  Okay I'm standing in the red. Is that
[8238.98s -> 8240.98s]  the red bar is going up?
[8240.98s -> 8248.14s]  That's offense right?
[8248.14s -> 8252.94s]  That guy's 256? Did they explain any of this?
[8252.94s -> 8254.94s]  No no no. Somebody died in the chair.
[8254.94s -> 8256.94s]  Now I have to come in here and
[8256.94s -> 8258.94s]  dude this guy is
[8258.94s -> 8262.40s]  kicking the shit out of me.
[8262.40s -> 8264.40s]  That guy just destroyed me. I didn't even get a chance.
[8282.83s -> 8284.83s]  So you guys just
[8284.83s -> 8286.83s]  got to see in real time the reason why I don't
[8286.83s -> 8288.83s]  play online multiplayer games anymore.
[8288.83s -> 8290.83s]  That's my experience.
[8290.83s -> 8295.25s]  I just got in. Okay I'm running around
[8295.25s -> 8297.25s]  this corner. Oh I got hit hit hit hit
[8297.25s -> 8299.25s]  every single thing. I got
[8299.25s -> 8301.25s]  like triple tapped. I'm dead.
[8301.25s -> 8303.25s]  Oh. Okay well
[8303.25s -> 8305.25s]  I guess I'm going to start again. Oh I got
[8305.25s -> 8307.25s]  hit in the air and then hit in the air and then
[8307.25s -> 8310.45s]  juggled and hit in the air again.
[8310.45s -> 8312.45s]  Alright I think it's going to open up Minecraft.
[8312.45s -> 8323.82s]  Let's jump again. Ammo algorithm.
[8323.82s -> 8332.14s]  Yeah I don't even know what that's supposed to mean.
[8332.14s -> 8334.96s]  That song sucks? Okay.
[8334.96s -> 8342.19s]  Keep moving. What happened?
[8342.19s -> 8345.20s]  I just killed the yellow.
[8345.20s -> 8347.57s]  Okay just keep walking. It's blue.
[8347.57s -> 8350.38s]  What does blue do? Blue is making my
[8350.38s -> 8355.63s]  defense go up. And offense. Alright
[8355.63s -> 8365.10s]  keep moving. Go go go go go go. Don't stop.
[8365.10s -> 8368.37s]  Good. Good. Alright keep going.
[8368.37s -> 8371.38s]  Warning. Low agility. Rest for a while.
[8371.38s -> 8374.69s]  I have to stop. Low agility. Stop stop
[8374.69s -> 8377.70s]  stop stop. I'm stopped. I can only walk a
[8377.70s -> 8379.70s]  certain distance. I get it. Okay.
[8379.70s -> 8385.38s]  Get to a bonfire. Hold on.
[8385.38s -> 8387.94s]  What's this thing? Like an eye? I have to kill it?
[8387.94s -> 8392.03s]  Touch it? High explosive area
[8392.03s -> 8394.03s]  effect ammo uses 10
[8394.03s -> 8396.03s]  units per blast.
[8396.03s -> 8404.40s]  Did I get it? I think I got it.
[8404.40s -> 8409.95s]  Hold on. This is red. Rest for
[8409.95s -> 8418.02s]  a second. Run run run run run.
[8418.02s -> 8420.02s]  This is like blue's base. Pick that up. What is it?
[8420.02s -> 8425.50s]  I don't know. I didn't touch it. I just missed everything.
[8425.50s -> 8427.50s]  I missed every single shot on that guy
[8427.50s -> 8429.50s]  and he was like a level one scrub.
[8429.50s -> 8438.21s]  Warning. Low agility. I know I know I know.
[8438.21s -> 8442.05s]  Stop stop stop stop.
[8442.05s -> 8444.05s]  Stop stop stop stop.
[8444.05s -> 8454.40s]  Shit. I'm gonna.
[8454.40s -> 8458.43s]  Come on dude. What the fuck.
[8458.43s -> 8462.78s]  When does my brain shut off?
[8467.86s -> 8469.86s]  That's what caused his algorithm to crash.
[8469.86s -> 8472.93s]  I don't know. No.
[8472.93s -> 8474.93s]  I'm feeling there's more to it than that. Jim, I think
[8474.93s -> 8476.93s]  there's a little more to it. I think he's just not very good.
[8476.93s -> 8480.43s]  Here's your stats. Let us know
[8480.43s -> 8485.62s]  when. This guy lied on his resume.
[8485.62s -> 8489.97s]  It says he was
[8489.97s -> 8491.97s]  he said he prestige three times
[8491.97s -> 8494.85s]  in Call of Duty Black Ops.
[8494.85s -> 8496.85s]  That's true. That doesn't mean
[8496.85s -> 8499.41s]  anything though. It just means he sat there
[8499.41s -> 8501.41s]  and just got experience over and over again.
[8501.41s -> 8503.41s]  This guy's not even good at anything.
[8503.41s -> 8505.41s]  You hired this guy on prestige alone?
[8505.41s -> 8507.41s]  You really fucked the whole thing up.
[8507.41s -> 8517.78s]  Didn't you Mike? Only on prestige
[8517.78s -> 8519.78s]  three. Prestige three. God damn it.
[8519.78s -> 8523.17s]  You can sit in the corner of a lobby
[8523.17s -> 8525.17s]  and get to prestige 99 in
[8525.17s -> 8533.49s]  three months.
[8533.49s -> 8535.49s]  The Devil XP Mountain Dew.
[8538.50s -> 8540.67s]  Look at how big this is.
[8540.67s -> 8542.67s]  Yeah, we probably shouldn't have given him all those cans
[8542.67s -> 8545.23s]  of Mountain Dew. What is this?
[8545.23s -> 8556.54s]  What did we just
[8556.54s -> 8564.35s]  stumble upon?
[8564.35s -> 8566.35s]  Do I get to select a unit?
[8566.35s -> 8574.22s]  Wait a minute. This is cool.
[8574.22s -> 8583.17s]  I can talk? What who is
[8583.17s -> 8585.41s]  where is? What who
[8585.41s -> 8589.30s]  is? What is P-Fect?
[8589.30s -> 8591.86s]  What is Pusher?
[8591.86s -> 8594.10s]  It knocks people out of
[8594.10s -> 8597.74s]  your way. Where is
[8597.74s -> 8600.50s]  P-Fect? It's everywhere.
[8600.50s -> 8602.50s]  You can't get away from it.
[8602.50s -> 8606.06s]  Where is
[8606.06s -> 8608.06s]  Stunner? Wherever you find it
[8608.06s -> 8610.62s]  I guess. This is the shittiest eight ball
[8610.62s -> 8612.80s]  I've ever shook in my whole life.
[8612.80s -> 8619.14s]  There's all the same answer. Where reality
[8619.14s -> 8621.14s]  ends and the dream begins.
[8621.14s -> 8623.14s]  That was the slogan
[8623.14s -> 8625.14s]  they hit us with when they launched this thing.
[8625.14s -> 8627.14s]  A new frontier in
[8627.14s -> 8629.14s]  virtual reality they said.
[8629.14s -> 8631.14s]  What they didn't say was that this
[8631.14s -> 8634.27s]  is the final frontier.
[8634.27s -> 8636.77s]  Oh, well that's kind of cool. It's like Star Trek.
[8636.77s -> 8644.82s]  Okay, goodbye.
[8644.82s -> 8647.63s]  What do you have to say? Did I somehow
[8647.63s -> 8649.63s]  accidentally beat the game?
[8649.63s -> 8656.48s]  How do I get higher rank? What is the
[8656.48s -> 8658.48s]  Garden? What is Perfect One? What is
[8658.48s -> 8660.48s]  Ashflay? What is
[8660.48s -> 8662.48s]  Chafe? What is Boomerang?
[8662.48s -> 8664.72s]  What is a
[8664.72s -> 8666.72s]  Pems?
[8666.72s -> 8669.34s]  You just don't get it, do you?
[8669.34s -> 8671.34s]  You're not going to get out of here alive
[8671.34s -> 8674.54s]  and ne- Was that actually Penis?
[8674.54s -> 8682.29s]  Was that like a how dare you don't ask me
[8682.29s -> 8685.74s]  that question? Nothing, really.
[8685.74s -> 8689.52s]  What is the Garden?
[8689.52s -> 8691.89s]  The Garden is perfect.
[8691.89s -> 8693.89s]  And perfect is the Garden.
[8693.89s -> 8695.89s]  Where is the Garden?
[8695.89s -> 8698.19s]  Wherever we are.
[8698.19s -> 8701.57s]  That is the Garden. Where is Perfect
[8701.57s -> 8703.57s]  One? Perfect One
[8703.57s -> 8705.74s]  is dead. Oh.
[8705.74s -> 8709.18s]  Oh, no.
[8709.18s -> 8711.18s]  Who is Perfect One? A liar
[8711.18s -> 8713.92s]  and a lie. There is
[8713.92s -> 8715.92s]  no Perfect One. So Perfect One is
[8715.92s -> 8719.25s]  dead, though. Where is Roberto?
[8719.25s -> 8721.55s]  Roberto is sixth in the hierarchy.
[8721.55s -> 8723.55s]  He's the crazy one.
[8723.55s -> 8725.98s]  Or maybe we're all
[8725.98s -> 8727.98s]  crazy and he's sane.
[8727.98s -> 8734.50s]  Goodbye. So, can I
[8734.50s -> 8738.27s]  pick one of these? What
[8738.27s -> 8740.27s]  the fuck is that?
[8740.27s -> 8743.41s]  What is this thing?
[8743.41s -> 8750.58s]  Like a fly?
[8750.58s -> 8752.58s]  I've been watching you.
[8752.58s -> 8755.07s]  I see
[8755.07s -> 8757.07s]  everything.
[8757.07s -> 8759.95s]  You know? Okay.
[8759.95s -> 8761.95s]  What is the
[8761.95s -> 8764.58s]  Garden? The Garden
[8764.58s -> 8766.58s]  is good.
[8766.58s -> 8768.58s]  Oh, I said what is the Garden?
[8768.58s -> 8770.58s]  Not how is
[8770.58s -> 8775.31s]  the Garden. What is
[8775.31s -> 8779.15s]  Perfect? It's everything
[8779.15s -> 8781.15s]  and nothing.
[8781.15s -> 8783.46s]  No, no. I didn't say why.
[8783.46s -> 8785.76s]  A computer program. A universe.
[8785.76s -> 8788.06s]  A dream.
[8788.06s -> 8790.43s]  It's all we have.
[8790.43s -> 8795.62s]  Okay.
[8795.62s -> 8797.79s]  Let's say where is the Garden?
[8797.79s -> 8799.79s]  There is nothing
[8799.79s -> 8801.79s]  but the Garden.
[8801.79s -> 8804.48s]  Are these people in the computer? Are these people
[8804.48s -> 8806.48s]  with me in the game? Are these other gamers?
[8806.48s -> 8809.30s]  Is that like a cool
[8809.30s -> 8811.30s]  transmog this person has?
[8811.30s -> 8813.30s]  I don't understand. Are these other gamers?
[8813.30s -> 8823.07s]  Wait, hold on. This became
[8823.07s -> 8827.55s]  a completely different game.
[8827.55s -> 8829.55s]  Okay, who is
[8829.55s -> 8831.55s]  the Garden?
[8831.55s -> 8834.18s]  It's the same thing as Perfect.
[8834.18s -> 8836.18s]  Okay, enough of this bullshit. What is it?
[8836.18s -> 8838.18s]  I don't know. A lot of people
[8838.18s -> 8840.18s]  have been killed around the East Residential
[8840.18s -> 8842.18s]  District lately though. Thank you for the info.
[8842.18s -> 8844.18s]  And no one's seen anything. What? Oh.
[8844.18s -> 8846.18s]  Makes you wonder.
[8846.18s -> 8848.18s]  Okay.
[8848.18s -> 8850.18s]  What is a cannibal?
[8850.18s -> 8852.18s]  It increases your offensive capabilities.
[8852.18s -> 8858.00s]  Okay, goodbye. Alright, which one should I touch?
[8858.00s -> 8860.94s]  Should I touch the Five Head?
[8860.94s -> 8865.49s]  Oh, that person's naked.
[8865.49s -> 8871.25s]  I can't activate any of these
[8871.25s -> 8880.08s]  things? Okay, I'm just going to leave.
[8880.08s -> 8889.36s]  The Prophecy of Porn Week
[8889.36s -> 8891.92s]  is true.
[8891.92s -> 8893.92s]  The door seize is neutral.
[8893.92s -> 8895.92s]  Enter to heal. Oh, shit.
[8895.92s -> 8900.02s]  Oh, they're trying to go into heal.
[8900.02s -> 8902.02s]  Should I just camp and wait
[8902.02s -> 8904.45s]  for them all to come out?
[8904.45s -> 8906.45s]  Yeah.
[8906.45s -> 8908.45s]  Jim, he's using his tried and true
[8908.45s -> 8910.45s]  tactic of Call of Duty XP
[8910.45s -> 8912.45s]  boosting. This is how he got his prestige.
[8912.45s -> 8914.45s]  I told you this guy was the real deal.
[8914.45s -> 8923.78s]  He's spawn camping.
[8923.78s -> 8929.54s]  He got me right in the fucking head. And when he finds a good
[8929.54s -> 8933.95s]  player, he runs the fuck away. Let's heal.
[8933.95s -> 8936.45s]  Find a red spire.
[8936.45s -> 8938.45s]  Wait, there are new players here. There are people here again.
[8938.45s -> 8940.45s]  This really is just
[8940.45s -> 8942.45s]  like, okay. Wait.
[8942.45s -> 8945.14s]  I want to talk to this guy. This is other
[8945.14s -> 8955.30s]  players.
[8955.30s -> 8957.47s]  Where is Ice?
[8957.47s -> 8959.90s]  If you think you can handle Tesla,
[8959.90s -> 8961.90s]  try looking around the power plant.
[8961.90s -> 8966.70s]  What is perfect one?
[8966.70s -> 8968.70s]  The ultimate virtual warrior.
[8968.70s -> 8970.70s]  He's never been defeated in combat
[8970.70s -> 8972.70s]  and he's been here since the beginning.
[8972.70s -> 8975.33s]  The perfect one is the rank
[8975.33s -> 8978.34s]  one. Where are they?
[8978.34s -> 8980.34s]  The spire.
[8980.34s -> 8986.53s]  The spire. Okay.
[8986.53s -> 8988.53s]  This person hit a hundred times on character
[8988.53s -> 8993.52s]  generator. Okay. Well,
[8993.52s -> 9001.20s]  what the hell is this? What is
[9001.20s -> 9004.06s]  he? A grenade
[9004.06s -> 9010.08s]  more or less.
[9010.08s -> 9012.08s]  This is like Dr. Manhattan's friend.
[9012.08s -> 9016.62s]  Dr. Charcoal.
[9016.62s -> 9023.34s]  A stun gun. It's a stunner.
[9023.34s -> 9025.34s]  I don't know where in the real world.
[9025.34s -> 9027.34s]  I entered in Palo Alto.
[9027.34s -> 9029.84s]  You can make the jump
[9029.84s -> 9031.84s]  anywhere in the country. At least
[9031.84s -> 9033.84s]  you used to be able to. I have no
[9033.84s -> 9035.84s]  idea what's happening on the outside.
[9035.84s -> 9041.54s]  This is a side hang. That was a lie.
[9041.54s -> 9043.54s]  I don't know where in the real world.
[9043.54s -> 9045.54s]  I entered in Palo Alto.
[9045.54s -> 9048.03s]  You can make the jump anywhere
[9048.03s -> 9050.03s]  in the country. At least
[9050.03s -> 9052.03s]  you used to be able to. I have no
[9052.03s -> 9054.03s]  idea what's happening on the outside
[9054.03s -> 9057.23s]  anymore. This, somebody just said this
[9057.23s -> 9059.23s]  would have been really cool to play back then. Yeah.
[9059.23s -> 9062.75s]  It would have. I mean, nowadays
[9062.75s -> 9064.75s]  not so much, but still
[9064.75s -> 9070.00s]  is pretty interesting.
[9070.00s -> 9073.78s]  Character generator. Okay.
[9073.78s -> 9075.78s]  Somebody said to go to the east side.
[9075.78s -> 9080.13s]  Why do we all have to fight each other out here?
[9080.13s -> 9087.86s]  Oh shit.
[9087.86s -> 9090.67s]  Okay. I'm gonna go
[9090.67s -> 9092.67s]  I'm gonna run away. Let's go over here.
[9092.67s -> 9095.10s]  There's a building I can go over here.
[9095.10s -> 9097.10s]  Can I go in here? I think I might be able to go in this.
[9097.10s -> 9104.90s]  Alright, slow down.
[9104.90s -> 9108.03s]  Can I go in this?
[9108.03s -> 9111.81s]  Enter the pyramid. To face
[9111.81s -> 9114.37s]  Medusa. I wasn't ready
[9114.37s -> 9122.05s]  to face Medusa?
[9122.05s -> 9130.93s]  Uh oh.
[9130.93s -> 9134.58s]  Uh oh.
[9134.58s -> 9136.58s]  This is gonna be this.
[9136.58s -> 9138.58s]  Shit. Watch out. I'm gonna go this way.
[9138.58s -> 9151.81s]  Where is she? Agility
[9151.81s -> 9153.81s]  is bad. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[9153.81s -> 9158.16s]  Is she gonna wrap around me right?
[9158.16s -> 9161.42s]  My offense is not terrible.
[9161.42s -> 9163.42s]  My defense is so bad though.
[9163.42s -> 9169.63s]  I'm gonna spam as fast as I can when I see her.
[9169.63s -> 9174.43s]  It's gonna be like
[9174.43s -> 9179.42s]  Oh shit.
[9179.42s -> 9184.85s]  What happens if I win?
[9184.85s -> 9186.85s]  She's rank 11. I'm about to be a 255
[9186.85s -> 9188.85s]  versus an 11. If I win I get to 10.
[9188.85s -> 9206.96s]  I just got one shot.
[9229.33s -> 9231.33s]  Run through the fields?
[9231.33s -> 9234.90s]  Run through the fields?
[9234.90s -> 9237.90s]  Wait, I'm supposed to be
[9237.90s -> 9239.90s]  dying?
[9239.90s -> 9241.90s]  I'm supposed to die
[9241.90s -> 9243.90s]  and run through the field
[9243.90s -> 9245.90s]  and stuff. Okay.
[9245.90s -> 9247.90s]  Get more power.
[9247.90s -> 9249.90s]  I lost agility and lost
[9249.90s -> 9251.90s]  D.
[9251.90s -> 9257.79s]  I'm supposed to die
[9257.79s -> 9259.79s]  and run through the field and stuff.
[9259.79s -> 9261.79s]  Okay.
[9261.79s -> 9263.79s]  Get more power.
[9263.79s -> 9265.79s]  I lost agility and lost defense.
[9265.79s -> 9268.48s]  Alright, we gotta run through a static
[9268.48s -> 9272.32s]  field. What the hell does a static
[9272.32s -> 9281.01s]  field look like?
[9281.01s -> 9283.01s]  Kill enemies, collect their static.
[9283.01s -> 9285.31s]  Now start and select to return to the lab.
[9285.31s -> 9292.34s]  Okay.
[9292.34s -> 9297.39s]  Okay, I got static. I get it.
[9297.39s -> 9299.76s]  Alright, cool. Did I touch that?
[9299.76s -> 9302.64s]  Weird pool ball. High power, long range
[9302.64s -> 9304.64s]  blaster uses three zero units.
[9304.64s -> 9307.33s]  Alright, so I think I collected that.
[9307.33s -> 9309.33s]  Low agility, rest for a while. So what if
[9309.33s -> 9311.57s]  I press start? Select ammo.
[9311.57s -> 9313.94s]  Oh shit, look at this.
[9313.94s -> 9318.35s]  Default, default. What's this one?
[9318.35s -> 9322.24s]  Select ammo.
[9322.24s -> 9324.24s]  Give all messages. Information
[9324.24s -> 9326.24s]  only. Warnings only.
[9326.24s -> 9335.78s]  Okay, let's go back. Select.
[9335.78s -> 9338.66s]  No, I can't do it yet, I don't think.
[9338.66s -> 9343.58s]  I get it. Okay.
[9343.58s -> 9347.62s]  Alright, so
[9347.62s -> 9349.62s]  there, I'm level 255. I have to
[9349.62s -> 9351.62s]  only kill 255s.
[9351.62s -> 9357.63s]  Do they just keep me in here overnight?
[9357.63s -> 9368.13s]  You're a prisoner.
[9368.13s -> 9375.55s]  I don't think I'm a prisoner.
[9375.55s -> 9379.65s]  Alright, let me try this a couple more times.
[9379.65s -> 9381.65s]  So I have to run around and kill a bunch of things that are my level.
[9381.65s -> 9383.65s]  So we're only looking for
[9383.65s -> 9386.08s]  shitty players. Avoid everybody
[9386.08s -> 9390.24s]  else. Burn messages back on.
[9390.24s -> 9399.58s]  Okay. Pointing, low defense.
[9399.58s -> 9403.98s]  Give me that static. I need, I'm already
[9403.98s -> 9410.90s]  dead. Static.
[9410.90s -> 9418.30s]  Okay. Static.
[9418.30s -> 9421.49s]  Static. Okay, now what?
[9421.49s -> 9426.74s]  Select ammo. How do I get out? How do I do?
[9426.74s -> 9431.41s]  Should we be strafing? There's no strafing.
[9431.41s -> 9437.23s]  There's so many
[9437.23s -> 9446.06s]  people over here.
[9448.06s -> 9450.50s]  Can you give me a flamethrower
[9450.50s -> 9452.50s]  or something?
[9452.50s -> 9461.65s]  What's this game called? It's called
[9461.65s -> 9463.65s]  iMercenary.
[9463.65s -> 9466.59s]  Alright, I keep losing shit
[9466.59s -> 9473.31s]  permanently. Okay, if I run around
[9473.31s -> 9475.31s]  fast, I run out of agility
[9475.31s -> 9477.31s]  and the game says stop moving. And when I stop moving
[9477.31s -> 9479.31s]  a guy 50 levels higher
[9479.31s -> 9481.31s]  than me shoots me in the head and kills me.
[9481.31s -> 9491.17s]  It's like a new map. Alright, static.
[9491.17s -> 9505.68s]  Damn it. I don't have any
[9505.68s -> 9507.68s]  ammo. Alright, I'm done.
[9507.68s -> 9509.68s]  I'm done moving on.
[9509.68s -> 9513.71s]  New game.
[9513.71s -> 9515.71s]  This is ridiculous.
[9517.71s -> 9519.71s]  No, it wasn't. I didn't kill anybody.
[9522.53s -> 9524.53s]  Stop gaslighting me because I'm the only fucking
[9524.53s -> 9526.53s]  person that signed up for this experiment for $40.
[9534.91s -> 9538.82s]  Alright, last one, last one, last one.
[9538.82s -> 9548.42s]  One more. Stop gaslighting the word
[9548.42s -> 9551.55s]  gaslighting.
[9551.55s -> 9553.92s]  I feel like the word has feeling.
[9553.92s -> 9555.92s]  Alright, I gotta at least do something interesting.
[9555.92s -> 9557.92s]  Alright.
[9557.92s -> 9559.92s]  Shit is so low. Look at how big that bar can be.
[9559.92s -> 9564.66s]  The fuck, dude?
[9564.66s -> 9566.66s]  Where am I supposed to go?
[9566.66s -> 9574.51s]  What do you have to say now?
[9574.51s -> 9580.27s]  Nothing. It doesn't have anything to say.
[9586.27s -> 9588.27s]  In fact, I think, I think they may have, I don't think very many
[9588.27s -> 9594.22s]  people still work here. That guy might be
[9594.22s -> 9601.39s]  the janitor for all I know.
[9601.39s -> 9603.39s]  Run from spire to spire. Alright, that's what I'm gonna do.
[9603.39s -> 9608.70s]  Just stay near
[9608.70s -> 9611.90s]  the pyre. You need to kill
[9611.90s -> 9613.90s]  higher rank than two of these. Alright, I'm just gonna go
[9613.90s -> 9617.54s]  fire.
[9617.54s -> 9619.54s]  Okay, cool. I just, if I stay still I'm gonna die.
[9622.48s -> 9624.48s]  Why is my chili so bad?
[9624.48s -> 9626.48s]  I can only walk for two seconds.
[9626.48s -> 9632.88s]  What's the point of having traffic
[9632.88s -> 9636.40s]  lights? Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[9636.40s -> 9648.69s]  It's so slow.
[9648.69s -> 9655.34s]  I'm softlocked. No, don't put me back
[9655.34s -> 9657.34s]  in. Can I please eat
[9657.34s -> 9675.26s]  something?
[9675.26s -> 9677.26s]  I think we ran out of FMV sequences.
[9677.26s -> 9679.26s]  So, we're just gonna get the basic
[9679.26s -> 9685.47s]  ones. Alright, when I kill
[9685.47s -> 9687.47s]  the green guys, do I get green
[9687.47s -> 9700.02s]  stuff? Alright, I can almost make it to the blue.
[9700.02s -> 9702.02s]  I'm almost there. Low agility.
[9702.02s -> 9706.56s]  I think I just died
[9706.56s -> 9708.56s]  from being too tired. Alright, that's it. I'm out. Pull me
[9708.56s -> 9712.02s]  out. Pull me out. I'm done.
[9712.02s -> 9714.26s]  That's it. I've done it.
[9736.29s -> 9738.29s]  This is German Pluto.
[9740.29s -> 9742.53s]  ...capture those static algorithms.
[9742.53s -> 9744.53s]  Permanently add their power to your projection
[9744.53s -> 9746.53s]  into perfect. Get to the point.
[9746.53s -> 9749.15s]  The rhythms you can crash into in Huffman,
[9749.15s -> 9751.15s]  the more powerful you'll become.
[9751.15s -> 9753.39s]  The better your chances
[9753.39s -> 9755.39s]  of attaining our mission objective.
[9755.39s -> 9757.57s]  Gain all the power you can this
[9757.57s -> 9759.87s]  way. Why didn't you tell me
[9759.87s -> 9761.87s]  this? Like
[9761.87s -> 9763.87s]  18 days ago
[9763.87s -> 9766.94s]  when I got into the machine.
[9766.94s -> 9768.94s]  Wasn't somebody in this before? Somebody
[9768.94s -> 9770.94s]  died in this thing. You don't think they had the data
[9770.94s -> 9776.58s]  before? Alright, one more.
[9776.58s -> 9778.58s]  One more. This is it. And then I'm done.
[9778.58s -> 9780.94s]  This is it. Last one. This is the actual
[9780.94s -> 9787.41s]  final one. This is the last one.
[9787.41s -> 9802.62s]  This is it. I promise.
[9802.62s -> 9808.05s]  Agility done. No more ammo.
[9808.05s -> 9810.05s]  Okay, fuck it, I'm out. Take me out.
[9810.05s -> 9812.93s]  I love this game. Don't stop.
[9812.93s -> 9819.52s]  Run into the static fields.
[9819.52s -> 9821.52s]  I died. Nobody even shot me.
[9821.52s -> 9823.52s]  Nobody shot me. I've run out of lives.
[9823.52s -> 9825.70s]  I've gotta go. Okay.
[9825.70s -> 9832.86s]  It's time to move on.
[9832.86s -> 9835.10s]  I don't even care anymore.
[9835.10s -> 9837.10s]  I'm just being tortured in here.
[9841.12s -> 9843.12s]  Can you at least just wake me up
[9843.12s -> 9845.12s]  and just give me a Red Bull? I feel like I
[9845.12s -> 9847.12s]  would have a little bit more opportunity to succeed.
[9847.12s -> 9850.00s]  Stop just waking me up and putting
[9850.00s -> 9860.05s]  me back to sleep, dude.
[9860.05s -> 9864.78s]  Restart the game.
[9864.78s -> 9868.99s]  We're gonna play another one. What do I wanna do now?
[9868.99s -> 9870.99s]  Here comes a mystery. You have no idea what it's gonna
[9870.99s -> 9872.99s]  be, but it's gonna be a mystery. Well, you know.
[9872.99s -> 9981.01s]  Give me one sec. Okay.
[9981.01s -> 9983.01s]  So this one coming up here
[9983.01s -> 9985.01s]  is completely in Japanese.
[9985.01s -> 9987.95s]  I have no idea what's gonna happen here,
[9987.95s -> 9989.95s]  but this is called Montana Jones.
[9989.95s -> 9993.47s]  You're gonna have to help me out here.
[9993.47s -> 9995.47s]  Out of this, probably about 6,000 people
[9995.47s -> 9997.47s]  or one of you know how to speak Japanese.
[9997.47s -> 10018.83s]  Somebody will.
[10018.83s -> 10027.22s]  It's a cat, Indiana Jones.
[10027.22s -> 10032.40s]  Wait a minute.
[10032.40s -> 10034.40s]  This is Wacky Racers.
[10034.40s -> 10037.58s]  Same company.
[10037.58s -> 10047.76s]  Now I'm excited.
[10047.76s -> 10049.76s]  Because Wacky Racers was awesome.
[10060.90s -> 10069.47s]  Nice.
[10069.47s -> 10078.24s]  Montana Jones.
[10078.24s -> 10101.97s]  Fully animated?
[10101.97s -> 10103.97s]  He was like facetiming like a grand
[10103.97s -> 10106.21s]  kid. Making funny faces.
[10106.21s -> 10111.01s]  But Zelda CD-i
[10111.01s -> 10113.01s]  is not. It's better than that.
[10113.01s -> 10124.27s]  Okay, Montana?
[10124.27s -> 10126.45s]  Alfred or Melissa?
[10126.45s -> 10135.15s]  Give me the gist of it. Give me the gist of it.
[10135.15s -> 10153.63s]  Give me the gist. What did you say?
[10153.63s -> 10157.71s]  I can't select anybody.
[10157.71s -> 10159.89s]  What the fuck was that?
[10159.89s -> 10164.22s]  Did I take too long?
[10164.22s -> 10166.22s]  Alright, where are we gonna go? San Francisco?
[10166.22s -> 10168.22s]  The Caribbean Sea?
[10168.22s -> 10170.22s]  Through England, Egypt,
[10170.22s -> 10172.22s]  Tibet, or Sofet?
[10172.22s -> 10176.62s]  Sofet.
[10176.62s -> 10178.62s]  San Francisco or
[10178.62s -> 10185.15s]  Sofafet? Let's go San Francisco.
[10185.15s -> 10194.94s]  Oh, you know what it probably was like? This message will
[10194.94s -> 10196.94s]  self-destruct in 10 seconds, right?
[10196.94s -> 10210.13s]  I got that part.
[10210.13s -> 10214.42s]  Now what? It keeps floating.
[10214.42s -> 10226.30s]  Okay.
[10226.30s -> 10228.30s]  We're landing.
[10228.30s -> 10230.61s]  Landing in San
[10230.61s -> 10232.61s]  Francisco. We're gonna try to get a diamond.
[10234.61s -> 10242.35s]  San Francisco.
[10252.78s -> 10255.15s]  What are we looking for?
[10255.15s -> 10257.15s]  What are we looking for? What are we looking for?
[10257.15s -> 10264.75s]  This way. We're trying to do
[10264.75s -> 10267.57s]  this way.
[10273.02s -> 10275.02s]  We'll take a firework, please.
[10275.02s -> 10277.02s]  I guess.
[10279.33s -> 10281.33s]  Okay.
[10281.33s -> 10288.16s]  Okay.
[10288.16s -> 10290.16s]  Now what?
[10294.13s -> 10297.52s]  I guess we'll take one. Is it puzzle time?
[10299.52s -> 10301.52s]  Oh shit, I don't even know what the puzzle is.
[10301.52s -> 10303.70s]  What is the puzzle?
[10303.70s -> 10307.34s]  I took the first one.
[10307.34s -> 10309.34s]  You never take the first one.
[10317.46s -> 10319.46s]  It's okay. If I can't read it, then it won't come true.
[10319.46s -> 10322.66s]  I don't know. If I can't read it,
[10322.66s -> 10324.66s]  if I can't comprehend it, can't understand it, it's not gonna come true. It won't be real.
[10330.80s -> 10335.98s]  Friends like that. What does it say?
[10341.87s -> 10343.87s]  Is that cursed?
[10343.87s -> 10351.47s]  Okay. What about in the
[10351.47s -> 10353.90s]  in here? Down the street?
[10353.90s -> 10363.70s]  Let's go in here.
[10363.70s -> 10369.52s]  Expensive vases?
[10369.52s -> 10371.52s]  Are we stealing something from here?
[10371.52s -> 10377.73s]  I don't understand. Steel?
[10377.73s -> 10382.34s]  Are we taking something?
[10382.34s -> 10387.33s]  Vases? Lamps?
[10387.33s -> 10389.63s]  Jewelry or something?
[10389.63s -> 10392.96s]  Should we go in here?
[10394.96s -> 10396.96s]  Yes.
[10396.96s -> 10398.96s]  This is Zero-kyo.
[10398.96s -> 10400.96s]  We are friends.
[10400.96s -> 10402.96s]  Don't desecrate one of the areas. I didn't do anything.
[10402.96s -> 10406.42s]  What are you talking about?
[10406.42s -> 10408.42s]  Shut up and pretend to be Zero-kyo.
[10412.51s -> 10414.51s]  This is Zero-kyo.
[10414.51s -> 10416.51s]  Is he angry?
[10418.51s -> 10420.51s]  He's like, come on over here.
[10420.51s -> 10422.51s]  Come here.
[10422.51s -> 10426.91s]  He says here.
[10426.91s -> 10429.41s]  Please translate for me.
[10430.41s -> 10438.97s]  Is it here?
[10440.97s -> 10442.97s]  I'm trying, but you aren't reading my messages.
[10442.97s -> 10444.97s]  Alright, I'm gonna read your messages from now on.
[10444.97s -> 10449.70s]  Sir, Sir Linkerton.
[10449.70s -> 10454.38s]  Sir Linkerton, please.
[10454.38s -> 10459.56s]  Help me.
[10464.50s -> 10465.50s]  Why, where they come from?
[10465.50s -> 10467.50s]  That many people could fit on that?
[10467.50s -> 10470.64s]  Where are they coming from?
[10476.64s -> 10478.64s]  Am I about to make a deal?
[10480.64s -> 10482.64s]  Linkerton, what's going on here?
[10482.64s -> 10485.33s]  He said welcome.
[10485.33s -> 10487.33s]  He said a little more than welcome.
[10487.33s -> 10491.30s]  Did I pick that up?
[10491.30s -> 10496.42s]  Okay, what did he say?
[10496.42s -> 10505.62s]  We just took him.
[10505.62s -> 10507.62s]  Were we supposed to?
[10510.37s -> 10512.37s]  Two minutes of dialogue.
[10512.37s -> 10514.37s]  I'm getting destroyed.
[10514.37s -> 10516.99s]  I'm getting destroyed.
[10520.99s -> 10525.47s]  Did you bring the money?
[10525.47s -> 10527.78s]  I don't think we have any money.
[10531.78s -> 10533.78s]  I found this guy snooping around upstairs.
[10536.08s -> 10538.08s]  Bring him.
[10538.08s -> 10540.08s]  Oh no.
[10540.08s -> 10542.08s]  Stay calm everybody.
[10542.08s -> 10556.02s]  We don't know what he's planning.
[10556.02s -> 10558.02s]  This became a different video game.
[10558.02s -> 10569.33s]  Five nights at Freddy's.
[10573.33s -> 10575.33s]  Should we leave?
[10575.33s -> 10577.33s]  Alright, I need a translation.
[10577.33s -> 10580.14s]  What is she saying?
[10585.12s -> 10587.12s]  What's this room?
[10587.12s -> 10594.48s]  What's this room?
[10603.30s -> 10605.30s]  I need to break my neck, she says.
[10605.30s -> 10607.30s]  That's not what she said.
[10607.30s -> 10610.43s]  Alright, what did he say?
[10610.43s -> 10613.06s]  What did Linkerton say?
[10613.06s -> 10615.55s]  That's the only person I'm listening to.
[10615.55s -> 10617.55s]  What should we do? What's this room?
[10623.36s -> 10625.36s]  Need a key.
[10628.93s -> 10632.06s]  He said next game.
[10632.06s -> 10634.06s]  I'm sure she did.
[10645.74s -> 10647.74s]  Every room is the same.
[10647.74s -> 10655.98s]  Every room is the same.
[10657.98s -> 10659.98s]  He said this video fucking sucks laughing my ass off.
[10661.98s -> 10663.98s]  He says you moron, you are going the wrong way.
[10676.35s -> 10678.35s]  Does anybody have any idea what's going on?
[10682.53s -> 10684.53s]  He might be saying you need a paper.
[10686.70s -> 10688.70s]  You need a paper.
[10688.70s -> 10691.33s]  Shit.
[10691.33s -> 10694.27s]  I need a paper.
[10694.27s -> 10709.76s]  He said play wacky braces.
[10709.76s -> 10716.93s]  Come on.
[10716.93s -> 10720.06s]  Toilet paper.
[10720.06s -> 10722.93s]  Stop.
[10722.93s -> 10724.93s]  We can't help you go through the maze.
[10724.93s -> 10728.45s]  It's all the same room.
[10728.45s -> 10737.02s]  I have to memorize what I clicked on.
[10737.02s -> 10754.22s]  Shit.
[10754.22s -> 10759.54s]  Get me out of here.
[10759.54s -> 10762.54s]  I'm finally out of here.
[10762.54s -> 10763.50s]  I took back the
[10763.50s -> 10765.50s]  Bannereck's Tojiki from the gang.
[10765.50s -> 10767.50s]  And it's a big success.
[10767.50s -> 10774.02s]  Get in there.
[10774.02s -> 10776.02s]  We made it out.
[10776.02s -> 10779.41s]  Nice work.
[10779.41s -> 10781.41s]  It's too early to be at ease.
[10781.41s -> 10783.41s]  Come on, come on, let's go.
[10783.41s -> 10785.41s]  Wait up, you little brats.
[10792.11s -> 10796.11s]  Manic Dragon, height 5'2, weight 3'2.
[10797.07s -> 10805.97s]  What is the trouble?
[10805.97s -> 10813.58s]  Why am I looking at this?
[10813.58s -> 10817.92s]  Am I going to ride it?
[10817.92s -> 10823.30s]  How many games are there?
[10823.30s -> 10826.88s]  I didn't mean to do that.
[10826.88s -> 10828.88s]  This whole thing was made in dreams, by the way.
[10828.88s -> 10830.88s]  Life?
[10830.88s -> 10837.15s]  Why is my life a fuel gauge?
[10837.15s -> 10841.63s]  How about his head?
[10841.63s -> 10844.58s]  That didn't work?
[10844.58s -> 10846.58s]  Why is there a timer?
[10846.58s -> 10857.31s]  Get up.
[10857.31s -> 10866.40s]  Don't get hit again.
[10866.40s -> 10872.80s]  I just have to avoid it.
[10874.58s -> 10877.52s]  Easy.
[10877.52s -> 10879.52s]  Wait, secret.
[10879.52s -> 10881.95s]  Oh, I did it.
[10881.95s -> 10887.38s]  Let's go.
[10887.38s -> 10889.38s]  Go where?
[10889.38s -> 10891.55s]  You can run into the walls?
[10891.55s -> 10897.81s]  Why can you do that?
[10897.81s -> 10900.18s]  I'm not...
[10900.18s -> 10914.26s]  It's getting...
[10914.26s -> 10916.26s]  It's going so fast.
[10916.26s -> 10921.31s]  You have no idea.
[10921.31s -> 10923.31s]  Okay, well, San Francisco apparently has been destroyed.
[10923.31s -> 10926.64s]  I don't know.
[10926.64s -> 10945.95s]  How about England?
[10945.95s -> 10948.32s]  I am way more interested in this game now.
[10948.32s -> 10950.56s]  Because of the...
[10950.56s -> 10964.83s]  Eight different game modes that exist.
[10964.83s -> 10976.29s]  Translator, ready?
[10976.29s -> 10978.29s]  Lost in England.
[10982.29s -> 10988.43s]  This boomer unironically enjoys shit.
[10997.81s -> 10999.81s]  Is this an anime made into a game?
[10999.81s -> 11006.53s]  I don't know.
[11006.53s -> 11011.39s]  Maybe...
[11011.39s -> 11013.39s]  Okay, so we've got cars.
[11017.57s -> 11020.70s]  It is.
[11020.70s -> 11023.01s]  Oh, no. Translator.
[11023.01s -> 11027.94s]  What was just said?
[11027.94s -> 11037.34s]  I feel like this is important.
[11037.34s -> 11041.57s]  Where's my translator?
[11041.57s -> 11046.67s]  My chat's going too fast.
[11046.67s -> 11048.67s]  Should you change your name to Fart?
[11048.67s -> 11051.30s]  I can't even...
[11051.30s -> 11053.30s]  That's so dumb.
[11053.30s -> 11057.33s]  Why did I read what you said?
[11057.33s -> 11061.04s]  It asks you to go back to Boston.
[11061.04s -> 11066.16s]  No, it didn't.
[11066.16s -> 11068.16s]  It asks if you want to use the car or the taxi.
[11068.16s -> 11070.16s]  But that's not a yes or a no.
[11070.16s -> 11072.16s]  Do you want to use the car or the taxi?
[11072.16s -> 11080.99s]  Yes.
[11080.99s -> 11082.99s]  Oh, dear God.
[11087.74s -> 11095.36s]  Do I have access to brakes?
[11095.36s -> 11100.93s]  Or speed?
[11100.93s -> 11104.32s]  We're going very slow.
[11104.32s -> 11106.32s]  By the way, you're driving on this side of the road, right?
[11106.32s -> 11117.97s]  You have to drive on the left side.
[11117.97s -> 11121.87s]  I can't do anything.
[11121.87s -> 11124.88s]  Let's get to full letter grade.
[11124.88s -> 11135.38s]  Technically, that's true.
[11135.38s -> 11137.38s]  We're going five miles per hour.
[11137.38s -> 11149.66s]  It's okay.
[11149.66s -> 11151.66s]  I tried to side swipe him, but it went fine.
[11180.66s -> 11182.66s]  We made it.
[11185.98s -> 11189.89s]  Looks like we're taking the taxi.
[11189.89s -> 11191.89s]  Where are you off to?
[11191.89s -> 11197.06s]  I don't know.
[11197.06s -> 11199.42s]  That's Glastonbury Hill.
[11199.42s -> 11201.79s]  It's a beautiful place.
[11201.79s -> 11205.79s]  That makes sense because we definitely didn't drive more than 300 feet away from that way the taxi was.
[11205.79s -> 11208.29s]  There's an Excalibur somewhere in this church.
[11208.29s -> 11210.29s]  We barely pulled out of the driveway.
[11210.29s -> 11218.29s]  Let's go in.
[11218.29s -> 11220.29s]  There's an Excalibur somewhere in this maze.
[11220.29s -> 11233.28s]  Okay, time for another guess which way to go.
[11233.28s -> 11237.06s]  I can't get any help from anybody.
[11237.06s -> 11245.36s]  I need help.
[11245.36s -> 11251.49s]  They won't help me.
[11251.49s -> 11254.50s]  Touch it.
[11254.50s -> 11257.57s]  What did you say?
[11257.57s -> 11259.57s]  Did she say don't touch that or touch it?
[11259.57s -> 11264.67s]  Friends later.
[11264.67s -> 11266.67s]  Holy shit man, Montana's dumpy.
[11272.37s -> 11277.36s]  Now that opened this.
[11286.26s -> 11288.26s]  That's the way that your dog looks at you.
[11288.26s -> 11290.26s]  When you're talking to them.
[11290.26s -> 11292.26s]  I'm a dog and I heard my name.
[11294.26s -> 11309.47s]  Can we do it?
[11309.47s -> 11315.04s]  Another one of these.
[11315.04s -> 11320.93s]  Right next to the...
[11320.93s -> 11324.13s]  There's another one back here, right?
[11324.13s -> 11330.58s]  Down here.
[11330.58s -> 11332.75s]  Pull this one.
[11332.75s -> 11335.50s]  That should open up the one behind us.
[11335.50s -> 11342.61s]  Theoretically, right?
[11342.61s -> 11350.61s]  Then we turn left.
[11350.61s -> 11357.71s]  Should I...
[11357.71s -> 11359.71s]  That's probably that one.
[11359.71s -> 11363.55s]  This game predates the Bible.
[11363.55s -> 11366.74s]  I don't know.
[11366.74s -> 11373.65s]  Probably not.
[11373.65s -> 11376.08s]  Straight ahead.
[11376.08s -> 11378.08s]  This one might do this door.
[11378.08s -> 11386.70s]  I hope.
[11386.70s -> 11388.70s]  Next? No, no, no.
[11388.70s -> 11392.03s]  I don't want to say that right now.
[11392.03s -> 11394.03s]  You really don't want to say that.
[11394.03s -> 11400.37s]  That's not what you want.
[11400.37s -> 11405.81s]  I'll take the sword.
[11405.81s -> 11407.81s]  These Excalibur?
[11411.71s -> 11414.66s]  That means I'm the chosen one.
[11414.66s -> 11422.27s]  I'm the chosen one.
[11422.27s -> 11429.57s]  Boss fight with the sword?
[11429.57s -> 11432.06s]  That would be awesome.
[11432.06s -> 11437.12s]  Mechanic mole.
[11439.81s -> 11441.81s]  You can't wield Excalibur if you're not chosen.
[11441.81s -> 11443.81s]  Doesn't it burn your hands?
[11443.81s -> 11453.22s]  Pennsylvania?
[11462.35s -> 11464.53s]  Can I use the sword for anything?
[11464.53s -> 11468.30s]  This is Super Mario shit here.
[11468.30s -> 11477.78s]  Look at these blocks.
[11477.78s -> 11484.11s]  Okay, I'm fine.
[11484.11s -> 11493.70s]  Shit, I gotta go down.
[11493.70s -> 11496.58s]  Don't blow this.
[11496.58s -> 11511.55s]  It gets progressively faster.
[11511.55s -> 11516.61s]  We're good, we're good.
[11516.61s -> 11518.61s]  Oh no, that's more of this shit.
[11518.61s -> 11523.52s]  I just took a brick to the head.
[11523.52s -> 11534.02s]  All right, easy, easy, easy.
[11534.02s -> 11536.58s]  I have to beat one of these levels at least.
[11536.58s -> 11542.91s]  Shit, come on.
[11542.91s -> 11548.98s]  That's bullshit.
[11548.98s -> 11550.98s]  If you get touched by a brick, you go all the way back to the beginning?
[11550.98s -> 11556.93s]  That's stupid brick checkpoints.
[11556.93s -> 11573.12s]  Who the fuck are you?
[11573.12s -> 11575.62s]  Wait, who's that?
[11575.62s -> 11581.42s]  Don't get hit by a brick.
[11581.42s -> 11592.48s]  All right, easy.
[11592.48s -> 11596.56s]  Don't move.
[11596.56s -> 11607.87s]  You tell me I was that far away.
[11607.87s -> 11609.87s]  Think of this game like an ass.
[11609.87s -> 11612.24s]  And pretend to eat it.
[11612.24s -> 11614.24s]  All right, ban that person for at least 30 minutes.
[11614.24s -> 11626.46s]  There's more of this. There's probably three.
[11626.46s -> 11636.32s]  Good to know that that guy is now a part of the encounter.
[11636.32s -> 11640.48s]  Just stay up top.
[11640.48s -> 11652.37s]  Why give me such an opportunity to not get hit?
[11652.37s -> 11654.37s]  Oh, give me a fucking break.
[11654.37s -> 11658.08s]  That was stupid.
[11658.08s -> 11667.66s]  I won.
[11667.66s -> 11669.84s]  I don't have the sword.
[11669.84s -> 11673.94s]  I think it's just cutscene only.
[11679.94s -> 11681.94s]  I said, what did we do to deserve this punishment?
[11681.94s -> 11683.94s]  You guys didn't do anything.
[11683.94s -> 11686.94s]  I'm gonna need some time to fix this.
[11686.94s -> 11688.94s]  Welcome back.
[11688.94s -> 11691.44s]  You got the legendary sword, Excalibur.
[11691.44s -> 11696.88s]  I immediately killed Mogura with Excalibur.
[11696.88s -> 11706.22s]  Please stop playing the 3DO.
[11706.22s -> 11708.22s]  No, dude.
[11708.22s -> 11710.22s]  What do you mean?
[11710.22s -> 11712.46s]  Stop.
[11712.46s -> 11714.46s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11714.46s -> 11717.02s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11717.02s -> 11719.02s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11719.02s -> 11725.10s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11725.10s -> 11728.61s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11728.61s -> 11730.61s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11730.61s -> 11732.61s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11732.61s -> 11739.58s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11739.58s -> 11741.58s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11741.58s -> 11743.76s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11743.76s -> 11745.76s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11745.76s -> 11748.64s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11748.64s -> 11756.83s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11756.83s -> 11759.90s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11759.90s -> 11761.90s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11761.90s -> 11776.37s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11776.37s -> 11782.45s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11782.45s -> 11784.45s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11784.45s -> 11786.45s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11786.45s -> 11795.98s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11795.98s -> 11799.95s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11799.95s -> 11801.95s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11801.95s -> 11804.70s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11804.70s -> 11806.70s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11806.70s -> 11808.70s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11808.70s -> 11810.70s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11810.70s -> 11812.70s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11812.70s -> 11816.86s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11816.86s -> 11820.32s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11820.32s -> 11828.38s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11828.38s -> 11830.38s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11832.38s -> 11836.54s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11836.54s -> 11839.62s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11839.62s -> 11844.16s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11844.16s -> 11846.16s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11846.16s -> 11848.91s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11848.91s -> 11851.41s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11851.41s -> 11853.41s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11853.41s -> 11859.81s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11859.81s -> 11861.81s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11861.81s -> 11864.30s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11864.30s -> 11870.05s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11870.05s -> 11872.05s]  I'm gonna beat you up.
[11872.05s -> 11874.05s]  It's not just a background.
[11874.05s -> 11876.05s]  It's also a foreground. I get it.
[11885.82s -> 11890.42s]  No!
[11890.42s -> 11892.59s]  Hooray!
[11892.59s -> 11898.46s]  I don't think I did that.
[11898.46s -> 11900.96s]  I need to get back up on there.
[11900.96s -> 11902.96s]  Where the fuck am I?
[11912.53s -> 11914.53s]  I can go through to the
[11914.53s -> 11916.53s]  background, background.
[11916.53s -> 11918.53s]  But not the background, background, background.
[11918.53s -> 11923.26s]  What's up there? Okay.
[11923.26s -> 11935.60s]  Shit! Did he touch me?
[11935.60s -> 11937.60s]  Fuel gauge? I don't know. I'm probably made out of
[11937.60s -> 11942.34s]  metal or something.
[11942.34s -> 11944.34s]  I just want to play Sonic.
[11944.34s -> 11947.92s]  Should I grab the chain?
[11947.92s -> 11957.82s]  I'm gonna hand him this.
[11957.82s -> 11959.82s]  Is there a...
[11959.82s -> 11961.82s]  I need my translator.
[11961.82s -> 11977.57s]  What does that say? Lusiary wall?
[11977.57s -> 11985.31s]  Are we jumping out the window?
[11985.31s -> 11987.31s]  Well, he's here.
[11989.31s -> 11994.56s]  He said jump.
[11994.56s -> 11998.83s]  Jump. Okay.
[11998.83s -> 12001.01s]  I'm gonna jump.
[12007.39s -> 12009.76s]  That was risky.
[12015.63s -> 12018.83s]  That was pretty good clear.
[12018.83s -> 12024.21s]  I like that one.
[12024.21s -> 12030.66s]  Did he fall?
[12033.71s -> 12035.71s]  He said bite the disc and play Doki Doki Literature Club.
[12035.71s -> 12037.71s]  Okay, sure.
[12037.71s -> 12039.71s]  I bet you that's what was said.
[12049.12s -> 12056.03s]  We're home free, right?
[12056.03s -> 12058.03s]  We got the good thing we needed.
[12060.03s -> 12062.59s]  Horse?
[12062.59s -> 12064.59s]  Or horse.
[12066.59s -> 12070.43s]  It's a bear.
[12076.43s -> 12079.04s]  What are the wheels for?
[12079.04s -> 12081.04s]  Do you really put aesthetic wheels
[12081.04s -> 12083.04s]  on the back of the...
[12083.04s -> 12085.04s]  and turn into a car?
[12087.04s -> 12089.04s]  You're killing us.
[12091.92s -> 12094.93s]  You're killing us.
[12094.93s -> 12097.94s]  Why am I killing you?
[12097.94s -> 12100.37s]  Hey, hey, hey.
[12100.37s -> 12103.44s]  You're choking me.
[12103.44s -> 12105.44s]  Get your hands off your own neck
[12105.44s -> 12107.44s]  and pretending it's me.
[12107.44s -> 12109.44s]  Go, go, go.
[12109.44s -> 12118.53s]  It's gonna fall.
[12118.53s -> 12128.56s]  Oldest trick in the book.
[12128.56s -> 12130.56s]  You are personally squeezing my brain juice out.
[12136.56s -> 12138.56s]  If that's the case,
[12138.56s -> 12140.56s]  the whole world will know I'm Zayac.
[12140.56s -> 12142.93s]  You guys!
[12142.93s -> 12144.93s]  Don't think this is over!
[12144.93s -> 12151.97s]  This is better than the first game?
[12151.97s -> 12154.46s]  No, it's not.
[12154.46s -> 12156.46s]  They're both equally good.
[12156.46s -> 12159.92s]  Welcome back.
[12159.92s -> 12161.92s]  I was a little worried.
[12161.92s -> 12164.48s]  Have you forgotten
[12164.48s -> 12166.48s]  that I'm the luckiest man in the world?
[12166.48s -> 12168.48s]  I would love to be killed by you.
[12170.48s -> 12172.48s]  Not by the weird
[12172.48s -> 12174.78s]  I-kill-you fantasy.
[12174.78s -> 12176.78s]  I already made that video. You can go watch it right now.
[12176.78s -> 12178.78s]  You can go pull up the green screen right now
[12178.78s -> 12180.78s]  and just sit there and be like...
[12180.78s -> 12189.42s]  You can sit there and watch the ASMR
[12189.42s -> 12194.86s]  murder you video.
[12194.86s -> 12197.23s]  Alright, this was funny.
[12197.23s -> 12205.09s]  It was fun. What's next?
[12205.09s -> 12207.09s]  You said...
[12207.09s -> 12209.09s]  Yeah, that's what I just said.
[12209.09s -> 12215.42s]  This one's over.
[12215.42s -> 12217.42s]  It's been three and a half hours.
[12217.42s -> 12219.42s]  I don't want to really
[12219.42s -> 12222.30s]  pivot to anything else right now.
[12222.30s -> 12224.30s]  I think we're going to clean this up
[12224.30s -> 12227.57s]  with a really good one.
[12227.57s -> 12229.57s]  The one that's coming up next is called
[12229.57s -> 12231.57s]  Way of the Warrior.
[12231.57s -> 12233.57s]  It is a full on green screen
[12233.57s -> 12235.57s]  real people in like costumes
[12235.57s -> 12242.35s]  fighting game.
[12242.35s -> 12244.35s]  This is where we're going to end it tonight.
[12244.35s -> 12246.98s]  We're going to pick that up. We're going to try it out.
[12246.98s -> 12255.17s]  It is an actual costume fighting game.
[12255.17s -> 12262.14s]  Give me one second.
[12262.14s -> 12264.14s]  I didn't even know what that image was.
[12264.14s -> 12266.14s]  I just saw that there was an image loaded into OBS.
[12266.14s -> 12268.14s]  I didn't want to blind you with those bars.
[12268.14s -> 12276.59s]  Let's put it up whatever it was.
[12276.59s -> 12278.59s]  Head to head fighting action.
[12278.59s -> 12280.59s]  Huge digitized characters.
[12280.59s -> 12282.59s]  60 to 80 moves per character.
[12282.59s -> 12290.34s]  And secrets to die for.
[12290.34s -> 12296.34s]  You've got my attention.
[12296.34s -> 12298.34s]  This is one of Naughty Dog's earliest games.
[12298.34s -> 12300.70s]  Is that really what this is?
[12300.70s -> 12304.16s]  Holy fuck, you're right. I didn't know that.
[12304.16s -> 12306.16s]  This is Naughty Dog's first game.
[12306.16s -> 12312.61s]  That's pretty cool.
[12312.61s -> 12318.37s]  Here's some gamer history for you here.
[12318.37s -> 12333.34s]  You're right.
[12333.34s -> 12336.42s]  How does it feel like I look like this guy?
[12336.42s -> 12349.47s]  Sometimes.
[12349.47s -> 12353.44s]  Music by White Zombie.
[12353.44s -> 12364.00s]  Real band, huh?
[12364.00s -> 12369.76s]  Way of the Warrior.
[12369.76s -> 12371.76s]  Thanks for using my subpar translating skills.
[12371.76s -> 12376.94s]  Hey, you were the one guy today.
[12388.38s -> 12390.38s]  I already love it.
[12396.38s -> 12419.20s]  This is like comedy mortal combat.
[12419.20s -> 12421.20s]  Or is this supposed to be taken seriously?
[12421.20s -> 12423.20s]  I don't know yet.
[12423.20s -> 12425.20s]  Mortal combat is already kind of like comedy mortal combat, isn't it?
[12425.20s -> 12430.37s]  Find the way.
[12430.37s -> 12432.37s]  CDI Genon?
[12432.37s -> 12434.37s]  Okay, here we go.
[12434.37s -> 12436.37s]  The fighting has but one empty page.
[12436.37s -> 12438.37s]  And it is written that the way of this tournament's winner
[12438.37s -> 12440.37s]  will fill this page,
[12440.37s -> 12442.37s]  finish the book, and tip the scales
[12442.37s -> 12444.37s]  in favor of good or evil for eternity.
[12444.37s -> 12446.37s]  The balance of the world will lay
[12446.37s -> 12448.37s]  in the hands of everyone.
[12448.37s -> 12450.37s]  Find the way, noble challenger.
[12450.37s -> 12452.37s]  Find the way of the warrior.
[12452.37s -> 12455.38s]  CDI Genon?
[12455.38s -> 12459.22s]  Okay, here we go.
[12459.22s -> 12464.85s]  Game? Arena? I can't...
[12464.85s -> 12466.85s]  No, game.
[12466.85s -> 12468.85s]  Arena? Names?
[12468.85s -> 12473.25s]  No name.
[12473.25s -> 12475.25s]  No name. Skill.
[12475.25s -> 12477.25s]  Whatever, let's just go.
[12477.25s -> 12480.64s]  Let's go to just game.
[12480.64s -> 12486.40s]  Jakey, Jake,
[12486.40s -> 12488.40s]  Dragon, Australia,
[12488.40s -> 12490.40s]  Hong,
[12490.40s -> 12496.53s]  Jitsu,
[12496.53s -> 12498.77s]  Bar, brawling?
[12498.77s -> 12502.54s]  That's high.
[12502.54s -> 12506.26s]  Style.
[12506.26s -> 12508.26s]  Military UK.
[12508.26s -> 12512.16s]  I kind of want...wait, what about you?
[12512.16s -> 12514.34s]  Style? Original.
[12514.34s -> 12516.34s]  What is original style?
[12516.34s -> 12528.10s]  Jakey, Jake?
[12528.10s -> 12532.96s]  Alright, let's do it.
[12532.96s -> 12536.29s]  Alright, I'm going to say Muay Thai France.
[12536.29s -> 12538.53s]  I want to do Muay Thai.
[12538.53s -> 12543.58s]  Oh, I need a second controller.
[12543.58s -> 12545.76s]  Uh oh, wait.
[12545.76s -> 12552.86s]  I don't want to hear any more exposition from this skull.
[12552.86s -> 12559.07s]  You already did this.
[12559.07s -> 12570.46s]  The graveyard.
[12570.46s -> 12573.02s]  The throne room.
[12573.02s -> 12575.65s]  The temple.
[12575.65s -> 12578.46s]  The pit. Alright, the pit.
[12578.46s -> 12580.46s]  Alright, the game is
[12580.46s -> 12582.46s]  demo mode? Tournament mode.
[12582.46s -> 12584.46s]  Okay, we're going to do
[12584.46s -> 12586.77s]  tournament mode
[12586.77s -> 12588.94s]  at the pit. Right?
[12588.94s -> 12595.14s]  Are we ready?
[12595.14s -> 12607.74s]  There we go. Alright.
[12607.74s -> 12614.21s]  Look at those skulls.
[12622.21s -> 12624.90s]  Those are secret characters.
[12624.90s -> 12633.02s]  Are they really?
[12633.02s -> 12635.02s]  Blue man, Jax, and scorpion.
[12635.02s -> 12640.77s]  Here we go.
[12640.77s -> 12645.44s]  Wait, he grows?
[12645.44s -> 12656.77s]  Alright, that's a dog. Does it block?
[12661.57s -> 12672.13s]  Is there a move list?
[12672.13s -> 12675.26s]  Wait, no.
[12675.26s -> 12677.26s]  Stop.
[12677.26s -> 12679.50s]  Can I do moves?
[12679.50s -> 12695.50s]  How did he do that?
[12695.50s -> 12698.70s]  Sonic the Hedgehog.
[12698.70s -> 12700.70s]  Come on.
[12700.70s -> 12702.70s]  Dude, this is hard as shit.
[12702.70s -> 12717.66s]  Rematch. Come on.
[12717.66s -> 12719.66s]  Alright, that's upper punch.
[12719.66s -> 12726.64s]  Lower punch.
[12726.64s -> 12728.64s]  I'm trying to do like forward, down, forward,
[12728.64s -> 12730.64s]  C. Down, forward, C. Down, back,
[12730.64s -> 12736.34s]  C. I
[12736.34s -> 12738.77s]  used the combo.
[12738.77s -> 12741.71s]  I didn't even do a move.
[12741.71s -> 12745.17s]  Hold on a minute.
[12745.17s -> 12749.52s]  I need the instructions.
[12749.52s -> 12754.83s]  Okay, it says
[12754.83s -> 12756.83s]  special moves, nine, page nine.
[12756.83s -> 12761.12s]  Special moves.
[12761.12s -> 12763.12s]  In order to perform a special move,
[12763.12s -> 12765.12s]  you need to develop some special button technique.
[12765.12s -> 12767.12s]  First, it is important to remember that forward and back
[12767.12s -> 12769.12s]  refer to the direction of the character. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12769.12s -> 12771.12s]  Sweep attack. First down, then
[12771.12s -> 12773.12s]  down, forward, then down, forward.
[12773.12s -> 12775.12s]  What? Press D-pad
[12775.12s -> 12777.12s]  down, then press D-pad down, forward,
[12777.12s -> 12779.12s]  then press D-pad forward.
[12779.12s -> 12782.83s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[12782.83s -> 12788.14s]  Down, down, forward,
[12788.14s -> 12791.22s]  down.
[12791.22s -> 12793.22s]  Skill points and magic.
[12793.22s -> 12798.72s]  Push the D-pad to the back and hold for two seconds.
[12798.72s -> 12800.72s]  Okay, cool.
[12800.72s -> 12802.72s]  Hold B button and press D-pad.
[12802.72s -> 12807.38s]  Alright, here we go.
[12807.38s -> 12809.38s]  Special moves. Perform a sweep move, then press
[12809.38s -> 12812.00s]  the left shift.
[12812.00s -> 12814.00s]  Press D-pad down, diagonally, then press down, diagonally,
[12814.00s -> 12816.00s]  D-pad down.
[12816.00s -> 12818.00s]  I have
[12818.00s -> 12823.12s]  whatever.
[12823.12s -> 12829.71s]  D-pad down, then D-pad down,
[12829.71s -> 12833.94s]  forward, then D-pad down.
[12833.94s -> 12835.94s]  I'm gonna win. D-pad down, then D-pad down, forward,
[12835.94s -> 12840.35s]  then D-pad down.
[12840.35s -> 12842.35s]  Means down, down, forward, then forward.
[12842.35s -> 12844.98s]  Okay, down,
[12844.98s -> 12849.78s]  forward, down, forward, down.
[12849.78s -> 12851.78s]  This is why fighting games aren't mainstream, folks.
[12851.78s -> 12854.40s]  Well,
[12854.40s -> 12860.16s]  I don't know about that.
[12860.16s -> 12868.03s]  If I hold left, it should charge.
[12868.03s -> 12870.03s]  I don't even get to do one move.
[12870.03s -> 12872.03s]  He did one...got it!
[12872.03s -> 12875.68s]  Why did I get hurt by that?
[12875.68s -> 12880.93s]  This is why
[12880.93s -> 12882.93s]  Smash is the most popular fighting game,
[12882.93s -> 12885.74s]  Omega Low.
[12885.74s -> 12887.74s]  Fox is at the bottom of the tier list.
[12887.74s -> 12898.37s]  I have to win one.
[12898.37s -> 12908.08s]  Come on!
[12908.08s -> 12910.08s]  It's anybody's game.
[12910.08s -> 12914.88s]  Don't lose.
[12914.88s -> 12922.94s]  Do a leg sweep.
[12922.94s -> 12926.14s]  I'm trying, man.
[12926.14s -> 12930.11s]  Please block.
[12930.11s -> 12932.11s]  Block. That's block.
[12939.12s -> 12948.02s]  Get the fuck out of here!
[12948.02s -> 12951.15s]  What was that?
[12964.14s -> 12966.14s]  That's frame precedence?
[12966.14s -> 12968.14s]  What's with the frame precedence? Bullshit.
[12968.14s -> 12982.67s]  Trying to figure out moves.
[12982.67s -> 12986.96s]  He's doing a...
[12986.96s -> 12988.96s]  I just got fatality'd.
[12988.96s -> 12995.17s]  Have you found the block button?
[12995.17s -> 12997.17s]  Yeah, it's B, but I can't even block.
[12997.17s -> 13004.45s]  He gets to throw shit
[13004.45s -> 13016.42s]  in the air.
[13016.42s -> 13021.26s]  I just threw something at him.
[13021.26s -> 13023.26s]  He gets such fucking
[13023.26s -> 13025.26s]  frame precedence, it's not even fair.
[13025.26s -> 13027.26s]  We both move at the same time,
[13027.26s -> 13029.26s]  and then his one hurts me instead of him.
[13029.26s -> 13036.24s]  Instead of me hurting him.
[13036.24s -> 13039.12s]  Block.
[13039.12s -> 13048.21s]  Block's not gonna do shit.
[13048.21s -> 13057.47s]  Sword versus fist.
[13057.47s -> 13059.47s]  I'm gonna check a new character out.
[13059.47s -> 13065.68s]  Do low heavies.
[13065.68s -> 13072.78s]  I don't think there is low heavy.
[13072.78s -> 13074.78s]  I think there's just punch and kick.
[13074.78s -> 13078.30s]  No, don't rematch.
[13078.30s -> 13081.63s]  Alright, one more try.
[13081.63s -> 13093.58s]  It's gonna be quiet.
[13100.62s -> 13103.70s]  It's hard.
[13103.70s -> 13115.20s]  New character.
[13115.20s -> 13121.34s]  You gotta use your burst.
[13121.34s -> 13123.34s]  Yeah, I know.
[13123.34s -> 13125.34s]  Alright, we're gonna do it with Shake.
[13125.34s -> 13132.45s]  We're gonna go with Shakey Jake.
[13132.45s -> 13134.45s]  How am I supposed to know what the tier list looks like?
[13134.45s -> 13138.10s]  Turn the skill level down.
[13138.10s -> 13149.30s]  Alright, here we go.
[13149.30s -> 13164.72s]  I get a weapon this time.
[13164.72s -> 13173.74s]  Do you have any fucking moves?
[13176.88s -> 13187.89s]  Oh, I thought she disappeared.
[13187.89s -> 13191.09s]  Shitty Jake. No, it's just...
[13191.09s -> 13202.99s]  I get to turn the skill level down.
[13202.99s -> 13205.49s]  Get the fuck over here.
[13205.49s -> 13218.40s]  Don't be dazed.
[13218.40s -> 13224.03s]  I got a fucking force field now.
[13224.03s -> 13226.03s]  This play is just so much better.
[13226.03s -> 13228.03s]  This is just somebody that knows exactly how to play this fucking game.
[13228.03s -> 13233.79s]  Dude, you're getting recycled.
[13233.79s -> 13241.66s]  How do you grab?
[13241.66s -> 13244.35s]  I keep getting grabbed.
[13244.35s -> 13254.08s]  I think I got it.
[13254.08s -> 13258.11s]  I'm gonna do the good A bait.
[13258.11s -> 13266.24s]  Is it gonna work every time?
[13266.24s -> 13268.24s]  Come here. Let me win one, please.
[13268.24s -> 13282.82s]  You're getting farmed.
[13282.82s -> 13284.82s]  How does every character have 60 moves?
[13284.82s -> 13290.19s]  Yeah, that's what I want to know too.
[13290.19s -> 13292.19s]  I think they're physically talking about even just low punch and low kick and shit.
[13292.19s -> 13313.82s]  I don't think it's possible to win.
[13313.82s -> 13316.06s]  I know it's physically impossible to win.
[13316.06s -> 13318.30s]  I can't do it.
[13318.30s -> 13320.74s]  Spamming's not gonna help me.
[13320.74s -> 13331.87s]  It's not gonna do anything.
[13331.87s -> 13338.91s]  What do I think of the music?
[13338.91s -> 13340.91s]  I can't even pay attention to it.
[13340.91s -> 13347.50s]  You know when you play a fighting game versus somebody
[13347.50s -> 13349.50s]  and you know that you're a thousand times better than they are?
[13349.50s -> 13352.26s]  And you let up a little
[13352.26s -> 13354.26s]  so they get to win at least one of the matches
[13354.26s -> 13358.26s]  so they don't never fucking play video games with you ever again for the rest of your life?
[13358.26s -> 13360.26s]  Why can't they do that to me here?
[13360.26s -> 13368.64s]  Nobody wants to play with the person that's gonna win every time.
[13368.64s -> 13370.64s]  You gotta give a little bit of give
[13370.64s -> 13374.22s]  so I think that I'm doing okay.
[13374.22s -> 13376.22s]  Even if you're gonna win every single match.
[13376.22s -> 13380.19s]  It's like, man, I got you in that one.
[13380.19s -> 13382.19s]  Yeah, you totally did.
[13382.19s -> 13386.54s]  Nice job, man. I didn't see that coming.
[13386.54s -> 13388.54s]  I didn't see that throw coming.
[13388.54s -> 13390.98s]  Hey, you want to play tomorrow, right?
[13390.98s -> 13392.98s]  Yeah, yeah, I love this game.
[13392.98s -> 13396.43s]  I got him now.
[13396.43s -> 13398.43s]  I got him locked in forever.
[13398.43s -> 13401.89s]  Look at the instructions, lol.
[13401.89s -> 13405.15s]  Yeah, I just read the manual.
[13405.15s -> 13407.15s]  You don't need to send me a PDF.
[13407.15s -> 13409.15s]  You don't need to send me a PDF.
[13409.15s -> 13415.74s]  I have it right here.
[13415.74s -> 13423.17s]  I have the physical. Hold on.
[13423.17s -> 13446.85s]  I want to see these characters. I'm not still gonna lose.
[13446.85s -> 13449.60s]  If I lose
[13449.60s -> 13451.60s]  this next match
[13451.60s -> 13453.60s]  I'll get 50 subs.
[13455.60s -> 13485.42s]  Well, the best character in the game
[13485.42s -> 13487.42s]  he has the Honda Punch.
[13487.42s -> 13496.38s]  Don't get cocky. I can't lose this.
[13496.38s -> 13505.28s]  Yeah, I'm not gonna have to give 50 subs.
[13505.28s -> 13516.54s]  It's not gonna happen.
[13516.54s -> 13519.74s]  It's cheesy. It's not cheesy.
[13519.74s -> 13521.74s]  The developers have it in the game
[13521.74s -> 13523.74s]  so I'm gonna use it.
[13523.74s -> 13528.93s]  Oh.
[13528.93s -> 13535.97s]  Hey, dude, you're kind of being an asshole
[13535.97s -> 13537.97s]  with that kind of exploity kind of move.
[13537.97s -> 13539.97s]  Well, if the devs didn't want it in the game
[13539.97s -> 13541.97s]  they wouldn't have programmed it in.
[13541.97s -> 13557.97s]  I win. No subs.
[13557.97s -> 13562.19s]  I win. No subs.
[13562.19s -> 13579.46s]  Scamming.
[13579.46s -> 13581.46s]  Oh, this is a really important question for you guys.
[13581.46s -> 13583.46s]  So I have
[13583.46s -> 13585.46s]  I didn't even know they were making this.
[13585.46s -> 13587.70s]  I bought it because I wanted to play it on stream
[13587.70s -> 13589.70s]  eventually.
[13589.70s -> 13591.70s]  But, uh, Kingdoms of Alamore
[13591.70s -> 13594.51s]  the re-reckoning
[13594.51s -> 13596.51s]  they re-kind of did the game
[13596.51s -> 13598.51s]  I bought it for Xbox 360.
[13598.51s -> 13605.74s]  Is the Xbox 360 version
[13605.74s -> 13607.74s]  better than the remake?
[13607.74s -> 13611.71s]  Should I play it on the original version?
[13611.71s -> 13616.58s]  Or should I play the new one?
[13616.58s -> 13620.48s]  Shit. But it's fun shit.
[13620.48s -> 13623.10s]  Kingdoms of Alamore. What?
[13623.10s -> 13626.50s]  I'll play either. It's a shitty remaster.
[13626.50s -> 13629.44s]  It's not a remake.
[13629.44s -> 13631.44s]  The game's boring. Don't even play it.
[13631.44s -> 13635.73s]  Bad game. What do you mean bad game?
[13635.73s -> 13637.73s]  New one looks nicer.
[13637.73s -> 13640.16s]  We'll see. Got some quality of life fixes.
[13640.16s -> 13645.86s]  Alright.
[13645.86s -> 13647.86s]  If I end up with less than 50% health
[13647.86s -> 13649.86s]  at the end of this round here
[13649.86s -> 13651.86s]  then I will give 100 subs.
[13651.86s -> 13660.43s]  Good.
[13660.43s -> 13667.02s]  Uh, crisis averted.
[13667.02s -> 13669.78s]  We're good. He's too OP.
[13669.78s -> 13688.34s]  I'm fine.
[13688.34s -> 13691.86s]  Ah!
[13691.86s -> 13712.72s]  I didn't make any bets this time.
[13712.72s -> 13714.72s]  Every anime fight ever.
[13714.72s -> 13726.99s]  Get off!
[13726.99s -> 13730.64s]  Ten seconds.
[13730.64s -> 13732.88s]  It just goes to...
[13732.88s -> 13742.22s]  Nevermind.
[13742.22s -> 13744.22s]  I was looking at chat. I wasn't paying attention to the game.
[13744.22s -> 13748.26s]  I was looking at the chat room.
[13748.26s -> 13750.50s]  I think my 3DO is
[13750.50s -> 13753.31s]  overheating.
[13753.31s -> 13755.49s]  Where's my character?
[13755.49s -> 13757.49s]  Why am I green?
[13757.49s -> 13760.62s]  What is happening?
[13760.62s -> 13762.62s]  I think the 3DO is going to break.
[13762.62s -> 13764.62s]  This thing was 600 bucks.
[13764.62s -> 13767.95s]  It better not be breaking.
[13767.95s -> 13778.37s]  It's going to be fine.
[13778.37s -> 13780.37s]  By the way, it's not even 600.
[13780.37s -> 13782.67s]  We're good.
[13782.67s -> 13784.85s]  It was way less than 600 bucks.
[13784.85s -> 13788.43s]  I just want you to think that I spent way too much money on this.
[13788.43s -> 13793.49s]  Dunk it in water.
[13793.49s -> 13795.49s]  Wait a minute.
[13797.49s -> 13805.92s]  Okay.
[13805.92s -> 13810.53s]  Put it in rice.
[13810.53s -> 13812.83s]  Put the 3DO in a bag of rice.
[13812.83s -> 13822.24s]  And then put it in the fridge.
[13822.24s -> 13843.47s]  I learned a new move.
[13843.47s -> 13847.44s]  This is horrible fucking gameplay.
[13847.44s -> 13853.07s]  I'm embarrassed for you.
[13853.07s -> 13855.07s]  Because you're watching me do this.
[13855.07s -> 13857.07s]  You know what I mean?
[13857.07s -> 13859.07s]  I'm embarrassed for you guys.
[13859.07s -> 13861.07s]  Because you have to experience this.
[13861.07s -> 13866.19s]  I'm embarrassed because you guys are
[13866.19s -> 13868.19s]  embarrassed for me.
[13868.19s -> 13873.76s]  So I'm embarrassed for you.
[13873.76s -> 13875.76s]  This gameplay is so bad.
[13875.76s -> 13879.15s]  That if somebody came in right now
[13879.15s -> 13881.15s]  that has never seen me stream
[13881.15s -> 13883.15s]  and watched this, they would have to assume
[13883.15s -> 13885.15s]  that every single one of you was a fucking bot.
[13885.15s -> 13887.15s]  That I was viewbotting.
[13887.15s -> 13889.65s]  This guy's playing a fighting game
[13889.65s -> 13891.65s]  and he's just crouch kicking
[13891.65s -> 13897.09s]  and not talking.
[13897.09s -> 13899.09s]  He's just losing and shit.
[13899.09s -> 13901.09s]  They have to be viewbotting.
[13901.09s -> 13906.26s]  They have to be.
[13906.26s -> 13908.26s]  Why don't you guys just start saying
[13908.26s -> 13910.26s]  you know when somebody's
[13910.26s -> 13912.26s]  just egregiously viewbotting
[13912.26s -> 13914.26s]  and all the comments are just like
[13914.26s -> 13916.26s]  wow, can't believe you just did that.
[13916.26s -> 13919.89s]  Nice one.
[13919.89s -> 13924.50s]  Loving the stream.
[13924.50s -> 13935.89s]  Blowing my mind.
[13935.89s -> 13939.98s]  And then they'll say in the chat
[13939.98s -> 13941.98s]  they'll talk about something that doesn't even exist.
[13941.98s -> 13945.25s]  Hey man, what setup are you using?
[13945.25s -> 13947.25s]  I'm really starting to get into the idea
[13947.25s -> 13949.25s]  of playing games on my PC
[13949.25s -> 13951.25s]  and I'm just curious what I should be using.
[13951.25s -> 13953.25s]  Well I have a GTX 1080
[13953.25s -> 13955.94s]  and that's what I use.
[13955.94s -> 13957.94s]  That's what I would say you should use too.
[13957.94s -> 13961.07s]  What happened to me?
[13961.07s -> 13971.06s]  No, don't use emotes.
[13971.06s -> 13973.06s]  No emotes. Don't do that.
[13973.06s -> 13975.06s]  Only say wow.
[13975.06s -> 13977.42s]  Cool gameplay or something.
[13977.42s -> 13989.78s]  Emotes have given it away.
[13989.78s -> 13991.78s]  I should accidentally alt tab
[13991.78s -> 13993.78s]  and show like five
[13993.78s -> 13995.78s]  viewbotting programs and go oh shit.
[13995.78s -> 14014.66s]  And it's this 56
[14014.66s -> 14016.66s]  this 5,673 people there.
[14016.66s -> 14018.66s]  I alt tab and it's just
[14018.66s -> 14020.66s]  5,672
[14020.66s -> 14022.83s]  viewbots.
[14022.83s -> 14024.83s]  Because I'm watching my own stream.
[14024.83s -> 14030.66s]  I have my own stream open.
[14030.66s -> 14044.03s]  I got power up.
[14044.03s -> 14046.40s]  I'm done.
[14046.40s -> 14049.28s]  I'm done. I'm done.
[14049.28s -> 14051.28s]  I do want to see the secret characters though.
[14051.28s -> 14053.28s]  There's so many people left to fight. I don't want
[14053.28s -> 14056.48s]  no. This one's supposed to be good.
[14056.48s -> 14068.94s]  There's still so many more.
[14068.94s -> 14070.94s]  There's still a stack of like
[14070.94s -> 14072.94s]  fucking so many 3DO games. But we need
[14072.94s -> 14074.94s]  a 3DO break I think after
[14074.94s -> 14080.58s]  this. This is just
[14080.58s -> 14082.88s]  Mortal Kombat.
[14082.88s -> 14084.88s]  And how the fuck is that move fair?
[14084.88s -> 14087.70s]  Explain to me how an entire
[14087.70s -> 14089.70s]  screen filling move. You can't
[14089.70s -> 14094.24s]  dodge this fair. Gonna be blocked?
[14094.24s -> 14096.86s]  Oh it can be. Okay.
[14096.86s -> 14103.31s]  I want to do the uppercut into the acid
[14103.31s -> 14106.13s]  like in Mortal Kombat.
[14106.13s -> 14108.13s]  It's kind of just making me want to play Mortal Kombat.
[14108.13s -> 14125.60s]  Is that me saying hey?
[14131.54s -> 14140.24s]  Stop. Only I can do that.
[14140.24s -> 14145.10s]  So what should we do next?
[14145.10s -> 14147.34s]  What should we do after 3DO? After 3DO
[14147.34s -> 14149.58s]  cooldown. I could do saw.
[14149.58s -> 14151.58s]  I could go back to saw.
[14151.58s -> 14153.76s]  Do saw 2.
[14153.76s -> 14155.76s]  I could do super monkey ball.
[14155.76s -> 14159.58s]  I could do
[14159.58s -> 14161.58s]  face painting. I don't think I'm going to do that.
[14161.58s -> 14164.72s]  Doom Eternal?
[14164.72s -> 14166.72s]  I don't know.
[14166.72s -> 14173.25s]  Monkey ball? Monkey ball next?
[14173.25s -> 14175.62s]  Well not today. But I mean like next stream.
[14175.62s -> 14177.62s]  Monkey ball next stream? Super monkey ball
[14177.62s -> 14183.18s]  next stream?
[14183.18s -> 14187.01s]  Super monkey ball next stream.
[14187.01s -> 14189.01s]  Lock it in.
[14189.01s -> 14202.75s]  There's one. That's a no more baby
[14202.75s -> 14205.18s]  games. Yeah and then I'll go
[14205.18s -> 14207.18s]  you know what? We'll do VR. I'm going to give you a date for VR.
[14207.18s -> 14209.18s]  Because there's so many VR games I need to compile.
[14209.18s -> 14211.18s]  Let's do VR.
[14211.18s -> 14215.09s]  Let's do VR.
[14215.09s -> 14217.84s]  How about
[14221.84s -> 14225.23s]  Let's do VR.
[14225.23s -> 14227.23s]  The week of the 28th.
[14227.23s -> 14229.23s]  And then we'll lead into
[14229.23s -> 14231.23s]  FTK.
[14231.23s -> 14234.62s]  So we'll do some VR stuff.
[14234.62s -> 14236.62s]  For like that 28th.
[14236.62s -> 14239.12s]  The week of the 29th. 30th.
[14239.12s -> 14241.12s]  Lock it in. I want to get back into it.
[14241.12s -> 14252.62s]  It's been a long time.
[14252.62s -> 14254.62s]  Half Life Alyx? Yeah.
[14254.62s -> 14257.12s]  We'll start with Half Life Alyx.
[14257.12s -> 14267.55s]  That's something I've wanted to do for a long time.
[14267.55s -> 14269.55s]  What about Drew Crew?
[14269.55s -> 14271.98s]  Drew Crew is I think not going to happen
[14271.98s -> 14275.31s]  for a while. You got that
[14275.31s -> 14277.55s]  one chance randomly a few
[14277.55s -> 14279.55s]  weeks ago. Remember where I panicked because
[14279.55s -> 14281.55s]  I didn't have anything to do and had nothing to play and I freaked
[14281.55s -> 14283.55s]  out. Something happened.
[14283.55s -> 14285.55s]  What happened? And I opened up
[14285.55s -> 14287.55s]  one of the Nancy Drew games and then I immediately closed
[14287.55s -> 14290.37s]  and freaked out. When was that?
[14290.37s -> 14300.22s]  Okay. It was weird.
[14300.22s -> 14303.55s]  It was Fall Guys? Oh
[14303.55s -> 14305.55s]  that's right because the Fall Guys servers were off.
[14305.55s -> 14321.60s]  I haven't done that move.
[14321.60s -> 14323.60s]  I don't even like this game but I'm still here.
[14323.60s -> 14325.60s]  I don't know. It's alright.
[14325.60s -> 14332.77s]  These songs are all the same song.
[14332.77s -> 14343.44s]  Uh oh.
[14343.44s -> 14348.43s]  I need to play Lisa the Painful.
[14348.43s -> 14350.43s]  I'm not going to play Lisa the Painful.
[14350.43s -> 14362.27s]  Not on stream.
[14362.27s -> 14371.04s]  Can you play
[14371.04s -> 14374.75s]  SSX Tricky?
[14374.75s -> 14378.59s]  I don't know.
[14378.59s -> 14382.05s]  It's going to be a painful
[14382.05s -> 14384.05s]  chat experience. What about Ratatouille?
[14384.05s -> 14386.86s]  Funny that you say that.
[14386.86s -> 14390.88s]  I told you that over the next couple of weeks.
[14390.88s -> 14393.57s]  I wasn't going to tell you when it was going to happen.
[14393.57s -> 14395.81s]  But Ratatouille is
[14395.81s -> 14397.81s]  going to happen. I'm not going to tell you when.
[14397.81s -> 14405.30s]  It's going to happen when you least
[14405.30s -> 14413.68s]  expect it. That wouldn't have been great if I had that
[14413.68s -> 14420.21s]  ready to go right now and I switched right now.
[14420.21s -> 14422.21s]  It's not going to replace FTK.
[14422.21s -> 14428.86s]  Can you go off the edge?
[14428.86s -> 14438.26s]  You wouldn't expect it during FTK.
[14438.26s -> 14440.26s]  Yeah, neither would I because that would be
[14440.26s -> 14442.26s]  a
[14442.26s -> 14444.26s]  waste of resources
[14444.26s -> 14446.43s]  and time.
[14446.43s -> 14449.44s]  When is FTK? October 3rd.
[14449.44s -> 14451.44s]  3 p.m. Pacific. October 3rd is the new
[14451.44s -> 14464.37s]  date for FTK.
[14464.37s -> 14469.74s]  The Gran Turismo 4.
[14469.74s -> 14471.74s]  Is there any actual driving game
[14471.74s -> 14473.74s]  that would be fun to scream? Would that be fun?
[14473.74s -> 14476.43s]  Is that one of those scenarios
[14476.43s -> 14478.43s]  where I would just be terrible at it and it would crash
[14478.43s -> 14480.43s]  and I'd give up after five minutes?
[14480.43s -> 14491.63s]  How?
[14491.63s -> 14493.63s]  Showrunner?
[14493.63s -> 14495.63s]  I actually looked into that. I just want to be able to drive
[14495.63s -> 14497.63s]  cargo over snow and mud
[14497.63s -> 14499.63s]  and stuff, right? It might be fun.
[14499.63s -> 14501.81s]  Maybe I'll play that soon.
[14501.81s -> 14511.86s]  We should do an FTK
[14511.86s -> 14515.38s]  command.
[14515.38s -> 14521.65s]  We'll play the Ratatouille game
[14521.65s -> 14523.65s]  on September 28th.
[14523.65s -> 14526.46s]  What? Oh, shit.
[14526.46s -> 14528.46s]  I actually did promise it already
[14528.46s -> 14530.46s]  when you least expect it, right?
[14530.46s -> 14536.99s]  Oh.
[14536.99s -> 14538.99s]  Did he just say find something new?
[14538.99s -> 14540.99s]  He's mad that I'm doing the same move.
[14540.99s -> 14544.70s]  He's getting bored of the scream too, just like
[14544.70s -> 14548.67s]  you guys are.
[14548.67s -> 14558.26s]  On VR!
[14558.26s -> 14560.26s]  I don't expect you to keep your promise. Yeah, I did
[14560.26s -> 14562.26s]  every promise on July 30th.
[14562.26s -> 14568.72s]  Alright, there are only two
[14568.72s -> 14570.72s]  I'm going to try as hard as I can to get through this. I want to beat the game.
[14570.72s -> 14579.66s]  I'm ready.
[14579.66s -> 14581.66s]  I'm going to just absolutely steamroll
[14581.66s -> 14583.66s]  the other two competitors. Let's go.
[14583.66s -> 14589.55s]  Do VR and Ratatouille?
[14589.55s -> 14591.73s]  This whole
[14591.73s -> 14593.73s]  room has to be set up for VR and has to
[14593.73s -> 14595.73s]  stay that way for a little while.
[14595.73s -> 14598.16s]  I like to stand up and do VR. I don't really like
[14598.16s -> 14600.16s]  the seated VR. That makes me want to puke.
[14600.16s -> 14602.46s]  So,
[14602.46s -> 14604.46s]  standing VR, I have to kind of
[14604.46s -> 14606.46s]  move stuff in the room and get it ready, so it has to stay
[14606.46s -> 14614.14s]  like that for a little while. Beat Saber?
[14614.14s -> 14616.14s]  I played Beat Saber already. It was good.
[14616.14s -> 14618.14s]  I had a lot of fun.
[14618.14s -> 14620.14s]  I don't know if I would play it again, but I played
[14620.14s -> 14622.14s]  a lot of it during the last VR stream.
[14622.14s -> 14638.85s]  I'm not going to find something new. This works.
[14638.85s -> 14643.01s]  I'm not ready to order
[14643.01s -> 14645.01s]  anything else off the menu yet. I know what I like.
[14645.01s -> 14656.14s]  Hag me when Jerma
[14656.14s -> 14660.30s]  lies. Uh, one time
[14660.30s -> 14662.30s]  I shoved a brick of cheese up my nose.
[14662.30s -> 14676.77s]  True, true. Okay, how about this?
[14676.77s -> 14678.77s]  I'm going to stream for another 12 hours
[14678.77s -> 14682.80s]  today. Is this the last boss?
[14682.80s -> 14690.86s]  Is this the boss?
[14690.86s -> 14692.86s]  I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna.
[14705.62s -> 14707.86s]  That's not true. Hag him.
[14707.86s -> 14715.02s]  Platforms? Yeah, this is kind of cool.
[14715.02s -> 14723.02s]  Cheesed your way to victory.
[14723.02s -> 14725.52s]  Yes.
[14725.52s -> 14738.96s]  It's still a victory. He's
[14738.96s -> 14742.99s]  so pissed. He doesn't want to give me
[14742.99s -> 14745.36s]  the medal at the end of the game.
[14745.36s -> 14747.36s]  Oh, damn it. Do something different.
[14747.36s -> 14749.36s]  You know, I've never had to get at a good asshole
[14749.36s -> 14756.66s]  like you with a trophy.
[14756.66s -> 14760.75s]  Now what? I won. You don't deserve it.
[14760.75s -> 14764.45s]  Let's get to the end.
[14767.39s -> 14772.45s]  Oh, I got
[14772.45s -> 14774.45s]  Contra'd.
[14774.45s -> 14777.07s]  Yeah, I got to the level 3 in Contra on
[14777.07s -> 14779.07s]  easy and the game said, uh, please
[14779.07s -> 14781.07s]  please play again.
[14781.07s -> 14783.07s]  This time on the normal difficulty.
[14783.07s -> 14794.19s]  Well, yeah, that's okay.
[14794.19s -> 14796.19s]  All right. All right.
[14796.19s -> 14798.19s]  I'm gonna call it here.
[14798.19s -> 14800.75s]  We're gonna come back with Super Monkey Ball.
[14800.75s -> 14805.49s]  Monkey Ball now? I can't do Monkey Ball
[14805.49s -> 14810.35s]  now. I have
[14810.35s -> 14812.35s]  discs surrounding me. I have to
[14812.35s -> 14814.35s]  clean this shit up.
[14816.35s -> 14818.35s]  Today was Psychic Detective
[14818.35s -> 14820.35s]  Day and I loved every second of it.
[14823.17s -> 14825.17s]  There's a bunch more 3DO stuff, but
[14825.17s -> 14827.17s]  I think we need, we need to, we need to cool down.
[14827.17s -> 14829.17s]  It's too much.
[14829.17s -> 14831.17s]  Too much weird shit in a row.
[14835.34s -> 14837.34s]  So I will see you guys
[14837.34s -> 14839.34s]  on
[14839.34s -> 14841.34s]  uh, on Monday.
[14841.34s -> 14843.34s]  I'll see you Monday.
[14843.34s -> 14846.22s]  For Super Monkey Ball.
[14848.22s -> 14850.22s]  Gritty goes on fire. Yeah, it's like
[14850.22s -> 14852.22s]  freaking me out. Things like heating up and glitching
[14852.22s -> 14854.22s]  and shit.
[14854.22s -> 14856.53s]  See you guys for
[14856.53s -> 14858.53s]  Super Monkey Ball.
[14858.53s -> 14860.53s]  Thanks for watching as always.
[14860.53s -> 14862.53s]  Just watch the Psychic Detective endings
[14862.53s -> 14864.53s]  on YouTube.
[14864.53s -> 14866.53s]  Maybe I will in the bath later.
[14874.53s -> 14876.53s]  I have to turn this guy off.
[14876.53s -> 14878.53s]  I have to turn this guy off.
[14884.53s -> 14886.53s]  This guy's gotta go.
[14886.53s -> 14888.53s]  The bath stream?
[14888.53s -> 14890.53s]  Okay, if I had
[14890.53s -> 14892.53s]  clothes on, could I do a bath stream?
[14892.53s -> 14897.84s]  Would that be okay?
[14897.84s -> 14901.62s]  Yes. Would it?
[14901.62s -> 14905.84s]  Alright, well let me think about that.
[14905.84s -> 14908.59s]  I'll think about that. Uh, let's go say hello
[14908.59s -> 14911.79s]  to Vinny. Like seven
[14911.79s -> 14915.12s]  days to die.
[14915.12s -> 14921.14s]  Not yet. Not yet.
[14921.14s -> 14923.89s]  Because we have credits to do.
[14923.89s -> 14925.89s]  Who's that guy? I want to be that character. That was like
[14925.89s -> 14928.19s]  Skeletor from, uh,
[14928.19s -> 14930.43s]  Prang. What?
[14930.43s -> 14932.43s]  What's the game called?
[14932.43s -> 14934.43s]  What the fuck is the name of the game? The game with the
[14934.43s -> 14936.43s]  skeleton with the sword and the shield. What is it?
[14936.43s -> 14939.25s]  Uh, what is it called?
[14939.25s -> 14942.64s]  Kill, uh,
[14942.64s -> 14949.55s]  Killer Instinct. Not the
[14949.55s -> 14951.55s]  brain that sits inside of the guy in Ninja Turtles.
[14951.55s -> 14955.07s]  No. Alright, here come the
[14955.07s -> 14957.07s]  credits. Thanks for watching everybody.
[14957.07s -> 14961.30s]  Ooh, this is different.
[14961.30s -> 14968.26s]  Ooh, this is
[14968.26s -> 14974.72s]  cool. Uh, that's pretty
[14974.72s -> 14976.72s]  sick actually. Nice job.
[14976.72s -> 14984.85s]  Thank god the music ended.
[14984.85s -> 14986.85s]  Now it's readable. That's actually
[14986.85s -> 14989.92s]  readable. Thanks for the subs
[14989.92s -> 14992.48s]  everybody. I appreciate it.
[14992.48s -> 14994.48s]  It's like your names are being etched
[14994.48s -> 15001.46s]  into the book. How long does it take? I mean,
[15001.46s -> 15003.46s]  we're at age. I can't be that much longer.
[15003.46s -> 15009.47s]  I mean, there's a lot of subs.
[15009.47s -> 15011.47s]  There's always a lot of subs. It always takes a long time.
[15011.47s -> 15016.08s]  There's always tons of fucking subs.
[15016.08s -> 15020.03s]  Happy birthday.
[15020.03s -> 15022.46s]  Am I gonna stream on my birthday?
[15022.46s -> 15024.46s]  Oh shit, I might have a
[15024.46s -> 15026.46s]  birthday stream on Monday.
[15026.46s -> 15031.46s]  It might be a happy birthday stream
[15031.46s -> 15037.22s]  on Monday. That's very possible.
[15037.22s -> 15041.70s]  I'll bake myself a birthday cake.
[15041.70s -> 15045.79s]  There needs to be music, doesn't there?
[15045.79s -> 15050.27s]  Oh, the music's not even hooked up here.
[15050.27s -> 15054.43s]  How old are you? 74th birthday?
[15054.43s -> 15056.86s]  No. You guys can take a guess of how
[15056.86s -> 15060.70s]  old I am. Wish my dad a happy birthday.
[15060.70s -> 15062.94s]  Hey, Tasty Turd! You might not
[15062.94s -> 15065.12s]  know that that's your son's screen name.
[15065.12s -> 15067.12s]  And you might have just heard that. Wait, it's my
[15067.12s -> 15069.12s]  birthday, and my son's screen name is
[15069.12s -> 15071.12s]  Tasty Turd, but I'm sorry to be the one to
[15071.12s -> 15073.60s]  bring that up first. But
[15073.60s -> 15075.60s]  your son says happy birthday, dad.
[15075.60s -> 15084.29s]  Thank you, Tasty Turd.
[15084.29s -> 15086.78s]  I will see you guys on Monday.
[15086.78s -> 15090.30s]  Have a great rest of your night. We're gonna raid Vinny.
[15090.30s -> 15094.21s]  Go say hello. Take care
[15094.21s -> 15103.15s]  of yourselves. And good night.
[15103.15s -> 15105.15s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait a second, wait a second,
[15105.15s -> 15107.58s]  wait a second. I'm gonna give $100
[15107.58s -> 15109.58s]  earlier. I wanna make sure I catch
[15109.58s -> 15112.14s]  this. I just caught it right here.
[15112.14s -> 15114.14s]  10,000 bits
[15114.14s -> 15116.77s]  from
[15116.77s -> 15118.77s]  Makao
[15118.77s -> 15120.77s]  Nuko. Thank you for the
[15120.77s -> 15123.39s]  $100.
[15123.39s -> 15125.39s]  Irma, your content always seems to make me laugh and I'm feeling
[15125.39s -> 15127.39s]  down. I started watching a YouTube video seven
[15127.39s -> 15129.39s]  years ago. Keep doing
[15129.39s -> 15131.39s]  what you enjoy. Lots of love.
[15131.39s -> 15135.68s]  Thanks a lot. Seven years is a long time.
[15135.68s -> 15137.68s]  I'm surprised that
[15137.68s -> 15139.98s]  some of you guys have been around for that long and you still
[15139.98s -> 15143.57s]  think this is interesting. I think we've
[15143.57s -> 15145.57s]  said this before, but even after like watching seven or
[15145.57s -> 15147.87s]  eight seasons straight years
[15147.87s -> 15149.87s]  of a TV show,
[15149.87s -> 15151.87s]  you kind of start to go,
[15151.87s -> 15154.37s]  eh, I'm kind of over it. So
[15154.37s -> 15156.98s]  I'm just happy that a lot of you guys
[15156.98s -> 15159.15s]  are still around. I'm glad that you are.
[15159.15s -> 15163.06s]  You didn't say it was interesting.
[15163.06s -> 15168.80s]  Alright
[15168.80s -> 15170.80s]  guys, I'll see you later. See you
[15170.80s -> 15173.30s]  Monday. Let's go raid
[15173.30s -> 15177.58s]  Vinesauce. See you
[15177.58s -> 15210.22s]  later.
