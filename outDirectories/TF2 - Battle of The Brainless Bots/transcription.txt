[0.18s -> 14.13s]  I'm already just so exhausted from even trying to put this together. There hasn't
[14.13s -> 17.41s]  been an ounce of enthusiasm in my voice since we started talking about this, but
[17.41s -> 22.53s]  now we're ready. I sent you the info. Let's do this. You like do not want to do this at
[22.53s -> 30.17s]  all. I almost like threw up. Did you hear that? A little bit, yeah. So here's
[30.17s -> 34.77s]  what the deal is, right? So here's Ster. He's a soldier right here. He's on
[34.77s -> 38.89s]  red team. I'm on blue team. This is upward. We are going to both have a team
[39.37s -> 44.17s]  of easy mode bots. That means our bots are at the lowest difficulty they could
[44.17s -> 54.41s]  possibly be at. And why is there a tank? This feels familiar. So no, no, don't
[54.41s -> 64.02s]  break your own fucking server. Can you give me one second to explain what's
[64.02s -> 64.66s]  happening?
[72.21s -> 80.20s]  I can't believe you made like a trail to yourself. Okay. Yeah, I really didn't
[80.20s -> 85.26s]  think you were ever going to be able to do this. You brought the truck punch
[85.26s -> 91.30s]  line over into Team Fortress 2 and your server is going to crash. There's no way
[91.30s -> 97.78s]  we're making out of this one. This place is shutting down. Shit's like flying by
[97.78s -> 104.24s]  my screen. Oh, no, we invested our money poorly. We didn't put it into a 401k.
[104.80s -> 110.36s]  It's disappearing. All of our money is disappearing. You wanted to invest in a
[110.36s -> 117.21s]  lollipop company. It's all gone. All right, come on out. Um, they're they are
[117.21s -> 121.53s]  not leaving. Oh, yeah, they have one person. It seems two of them has left.
[122.65s -> 126.65s]  They're a little bit delayed. They're making some progress. Don't worry. We
[126.65s -> 131.81s]  have a we have our sentry set up in a very optimal situation with a scout not
[131.81s -> 135.93s]  moving standing next to it. Oh, I think I think my guys are pushing in. We got
[135.93s -> 139.05s]  it. We got a heavy medic combination coming in through the front control
[139.05s -> 143.77s]  point here. Pyro coming out here. Looks like you see your spy. No, I'm watching
[143.77s -> 152.85s]  the action. There is no, what are they doing? What is he still doing? He's out
[152.85s -> 160.03s]  of bullets, I think. Oh, okay. I'm going to, I'm going to pay attention to
[160.03s -> 165.27s]  something else. Why is they doing a melee fight? Are you kidding me right
[165.27s -> 173.30s]  now? What the fuck? Did you seriously make every single person a spy? Yes. Oh,
[173.30s -> 180.94s]  my God. What are they doing? What is your team doing? What? Why are they
[180.94s -> 185.18s]  freaking out in the corner over here? That's just what spies do. This is what
[185.18s -> 190.21s]  you should be aiming for. Oh, make sure you're disguised. Make sure he doesn't
[190.21s -> 197.30s]  see you. I just heard like 10 seconds. I wonder if one. Why are they trying to
[197.30s -> 201.54s]  jump through the boards? That doesn't work like that. You're not like made out
[201.54s -> 214.58s]  of taffy. Here we go. Um, here they go. I'm unstoppable. Don't even tell it.
[214.58s -> 218.28s]  Please don't tell me they're all gonna keep coming out of this door. Where else
[218.28s -> 223.88s]  would they go? I don't know. One option. I just, I go out this door. Oh, you're
[223.88s -> 229.48s]  spies. I think you like broke them. Hold on. Let me see where they are. Are they
[229.48s -> 244.68s]  done? No, they're all going out the front door. This is stupid. No, they're
[244.68s -> 257.42s]  going after each other. There was one too many of them. No one's gonna go
[257.42s -> 261.18s]  for the point. This is gonna last exactly three minutes and 32 seconds
[261.18s -> 265.39s]  because there's absolutely no way any of these brainless son of a bitches are
[265.39s -> 272.63s]  gonna go for that point. Okay, this one engineer is really just going for gold.
[272.63s -> 277.58s]  We actually capped it. Really? How the hell did that happen? I don't know. Maybe
[277.58s -> 280.10s]  had something to do with the tank.
[284.78s -> 293.09s]  It's just going through. They're all gonna get stuck on it. They're all just shooting it like what the hell is this block of the door?
[293.09s -> 297.93s]  This guy's freaking out. I'm about to get trick stabbed. No, no, no. Is it actually making its way in?
[298.33s -> 311.33s]  No, it's not. Is it? Please crush them. Please crush. You go for like crushing them. No, it didn't kill them. They got it in. They got it in.
[331.17s -> 341.03s]  I'm gonna die. This should not be happening. Drive up. They're actually doing enough damage to it.
[341.43s -> 357.49s]  Engineers on the back of the tank? Yes. Oh my god. Oh, you didn't think this could get even dumber. It's genetic. They just keep getting right over.
[363.80s -> 373.00s]  Alright, redo. Retake. I need like a second before I throw up. Why are they all taunting?
[373.40s -> 382.57s]  They don't even know where to shoot yet. Why are they not shooting you? Because the round doesn't start. I'm not supposed to be out here.
[382.57s -> 390.96s]  Oh, they're that confused about the round not being started yet. That they refuse to shoot you. What are they?
[390.96s -> 395.39s]  This doesn't make any... Wait, I want to see what happens in one second.
[396.39s -> 405.56s]  How is anybody on blue team gonna get anything done? You have such a huge advantage.
[405.96s -> 411.96s]  Because you're allowed to build your sentries first. My guys are being like dumbasses trying to do like leapfrog in the spawn.
[411.96s -> 419.26s]  Hey, you could be a little bit more respectful. Just wait. Wait till this 12 seconds counts down.
[419.26s -> 422.26s]  I bet you every single one of these guys just walks out and just gets eaten alive.
[422.26s -> 428.34s]  Eaten alive by what? We barely have a defense. The sentry mosquitoes.
[428.34s -> 433.28s]  Alright, here we go. You need a catchphrase for everything. Here we go. Let's see what happens.
[433.28s -> 437.28s]  Oh, this is gonna work. This is gonna work. They all backed up instantly.
[437.28s -> 441.28s]  Nah, let's just build them back here. Let's start getting these teleporters up.
[442.28s -> 445.28s]  They're so confused. You're still prioritizing the teleporters over sentries.
[445.28s -> 448.28s]  Yeah, they'd rather build teleporters than sentries.
[449.28s -> 454.28s]  No, seriously, this was done. The joke was over.
[455.28s -> 458.28s]  That joke ended so long ago.
[458.28s -> 464.27s]  Why do you have to fucking ruin everything?
