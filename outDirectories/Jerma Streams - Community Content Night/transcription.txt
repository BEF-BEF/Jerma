[0.82s -> 11.32s]  Good afternoon. Hello. Hi. Hope everyone's having a good day. I know I saw you last night and the
[11.32s -> 21.24s]  night before, but you know, just checking in on you. Today we have a very special stream,
[22.76s -> 29.46s]  one of hopefully many of these. You probably saw the title change earlier, like an hour ago.
[30.70s -> 39.13s]  We're going to do the Community Content Night. I've been talking about these for a long time,
[40.26s -> 48.44s]  and the first one's going to be tonight, or today, depending on where you are. These streams
[49.00s -> 54.44s]  will be once every month or two. I am going to monitor because there was a lot of submissions.
[55.08s -> 61.56s]  So I'm going to try to monitor how long this stream was, right? And then count how many,
[61.56s -> 65.40s]  I guess I'm going to keep track of how many tabs I had and how many length of the videos and all
[65.40s -> 70.44s]  that stuff. So I have no idea. This stream might be long, it might be kind of short,
[70.44s -> 79.34s]  but I want this is the first one. This is an experiment. He's got a stream monitor open.
[82.87s -> 91.75s]  You know, when you have too many tabs, when Google Chrome no longer puts the new tabs on top of the
[91.75s -> 102.52s]  screen. When I was clicking new tabs, it's like a ruler. Each increment of where a centimeter
[102.52s -> 108.90s]  is a new tab. It's a ruler up here. A giant ruler, a yardstick with centimeters on it.
[108.90s -> 118.89s]  Those are hard to find. Not using Firefox. Well, I use Chrome on stream. I use Firefox
[119.69s -> 132.58s]  for me. That's me. Chrome? Stream. Firefox? Me. Why do I do that? Well, that's because I do all of my
[132.58s -> 140.98s]  things on Firefox. I do all of my banking on Firefox. I do all of my all of my passwords
[140.98s -> 147.66s]  going to Firefox. So Chrome is a completely separated, totally separate entity that is
[147.66s -> 166.52s]  only for streams. Banking. All his Reddit accounts are on Firefox. Why do you have that many stream
[166.52s -> 177.29s]  tabs open? What do you mean stream tabs? Not using Internet Explorer? Here's the thing about Edge.
[179.24s -> 190.31s]  Isn't Edge kind of good? No. I've, I've heard that it's sort of good now. No, it's not. No.
[192.28s -> 198.89s]  I've heard it. It's okay. They've been slowly building that browser to make it a little bit
[198.89s -> 206.89s]  better for everybody, I think. But I like Firefox. Chrome was all right, but I don't know. When you
[207.29s -> 212.57s]  do Ctrl Alt Delete when you have one browser of Chrome open. I don't know why browsers do this.
[212.57s -> 220.36s]  Some of them do. Why are there like 12 processes when you have a Chrome browser open? Why? What does
[220.36s -> 235.46s]  it do? Why can it be one? It's one per tab. That's because Chrome sucks. Each process is a tab. No.
[236.41s -> 244.34s]  How my number is doing? Oh, shit. I forgot to open it. I forgot to keep it open. I turned off my
[244.34s -> 251.77s]  computer. I was gonna have it going for like 16 hours. Oh, well. I'm never playing it again now.
[251.77s -> 258.63s]  That's the nail in the coffin right there. Not playing it again. Once you make a mistake like
[258.63s -> 263.74s]  that, you cannot do that again. Now I have to go. What am I gonna open it again? Wow, that's too much
[263.74s -> 272.73s]  work. And speaking of work, I would like to change. We're gonna move on here. We're gonna start.
[273.91s -> 279.48s]  There are a lot of videos. There are a lot of pieces of artwork. This is Community Content
[279.48s -> 284.28s]  Knight number one. You were here for this one. You were here for the first one ever.
[290.36s -> 298.76s]  So let's start with the artwork. Here it is. This is artwork number one. Now one thing I do have to say
[299.64s -> 308.89s]  for the future. In the future, it's probably a good idea for you guys to watermark these with
[308.89s -> 314.60s]  your name because there are so many submissions that it's kind of, you know, it's hard to keep
[314.60s -> 319.96s]  track of every single person. So for the future, if you have something you want to put forward here,
[320.76s -> 328.15s]  throw a watermark on it if you want. If you, you know, want people to know that it was you.
[328.15s -> 340.79s]  It's mine now. Now let's go. Should I do cam for this? I don't want to do cam. Should I? I'm like,
[340.79s -> 345.69s]  all right, I'll just be down here at the bottom. All right. So how do you, I don't use Chrome.
[345.69s -> 354.92s]  How do you zoom in on Chrome? Is it control and scroll? What is it? This is, I don't use
[354.92s -> 360.73s]  Chrome. This is my streaming computer. There we go. All right. So this looks like a rumble.
[360.73s -> 366.01s]  This is, isn't, this is, uh, Gloo Man, Demon Lord Zaraxos, and a bunch of other fucking crazy
[366.01s -> 372.02s]  characters. So we got, this isn't good. Demon Lord Zaraxos is too strong, but if I fail,
[372.02s -> 378.02s]  the Jerma Rumble is doomed. You think you can beat me, you Gloo Man, the original shit character?
[378.02s -> 384.38s]  And then a big laugh. I'm the lord of all hells. You haven't got a chance. I may be the original
[384.38s -> 391.10s]  shit character, but I won't give up. Not when all of my friends are counting on me. You can do it.
[391.10s -> 396.33s]  All the beers agree on it. Beer. I make all the rules, kid, and I rule number one is don't lose
[396.33s -> 400.47s]  to this asshole. Gloo Man, win this for all the shit characters. This is all, that's all I get.
[400.47s -> 408.97s]  This is all the shitty characters. Like, well, that's, that's not a shit character. Do the voices.
[408.97s -> 418.41s]  You know, I need to sip my fucking cold classic before I can do that. Read, I'm reading them.
[418.41s -> 428.33s]  I am reading them. No, you can do it. All the beers agree on it. Beer. I make all the rules,
[428.33s -> 434.81s]  kid, and number one is don't lose to this guy. That boy didn't have a voice. Gloo Man,
[434.81s -> 440.01s]  win this for the shit characters. We believe in you. That's not what his voice is. That's
[440.01s -> 447.10s]  a placeholder. It's a template. Uh, Gloo Man can beat him. I bet all of my goat eggs on it.
[447.10s -> 454.28s]  And you can never have too many eggs. That's true. Hey, I think you fucking jump seed my grandson.
[454.28s -> 468.23s]  The little shit fuckhead is late for the stream. That's the best character. It is. I'm not late.
[468.23s -> 471.75s]  It's not even two o'clock. It's not even two o'clock. What are you on about?
[472.92s -> 477.72s]  That was great. And look at how quickly we can just go like this. Here's another fair
[477.72s -> 490.20s]  enough for the egg. Did someone ask for an egg? Balancing eggs. Very good. I'm early. I'm not
[490.20s -> 497.43s]  early. I'm in the exact window. Good stuff. I did say this in the rumble video, but the egg has
[497.43s -> 503.66s]  only been in two videos ever. He just, he has, that's the test of time. If you don't want a
[503.66s -> 509.50s]  character is, is just, is a great character when they've been on camera and on screen
[509.50s -> 522.41s]  for a collective, maybe seven minutes in 10 years of me doing this. And this fireman,
[522.41s -> 533.85s]  observe this individual, this handsome fireman. That's terrifying. That's horrifying, but still
[533.85s -> 542.68s]  cool at the same time. Am I going to play cube world? Are you going to play cube world?
[542.68s -> 553.64s]  Did I just get asked if I'm going to play cube world? No, I'm not. I'm not going to play cube
[553.64s -> 562.31s]  world. Uh, this is this, uh, person said that this is drawn in the, uh, style of, uh, I'm going to,
[562.31s -> 565.99s]  I'm going to butcher this name and it's a very popular, very, very talented artist,
[567.03s -> 577.30s]  Gendi Tartovsky, Gendi Tartovsky, Turovsky. What am I so phonetically spelled out for me, please.
[577.94s -> 587.53s]  The book is just almost flew out of my nose and we're not even five minutes into the stream.
[588.65s -> 603.16s]  He practiced that line for three hours. What? Gendi? Whatever. It's, that's, that's the guy
[603.16s -> 609.74s]  made Samurai Jack. Very cool. I love the line work. You're going to get, uh, by the way, you're,
[609.74s -> 616.44s]  I don't know anything about art. Uh, like you're going to get weird, uh, positive things here. I'm
[616.44s -> 620.28s]  going to be like, Oh, I really love the, uh, I really love the, the, the color scheme. And
[620.28s -> 623.56s]  if you're going to be like, fuck you talking about, you don't know anything about color schemes,
[623.56s -> 626.52s]  idiot. And I'm going to be like, I don't know. I just like it. So I don't know anything.
[631.72s -> 641.53s]  This is actually my ideal outfit. If I could wear this every day, I would, like, I mean, I do
[641.53s -> 647.24s]  besides, I mean, it's, it's blue, but this is, oh, I didn't show you this. This is, I, I got,
[647.24s -> 651.00s]  let me tell you something. I got a quick story for you. Take a look at this shit. I like this
[651.00s -> 654.84s]  shirt a lot and now I can never probably wear it again. Unless I get something like Oxy clean
[654.84s -> 661.56s]  or something to fix it. Take a look at this shit. I have coffee all over me. Can you guys see that?
[662.36s -> 673.43s]  It's literally all over the whole shirt. Um, coffee shops do this thing sometimes where they
[673.43s -> 682.15s]  fill your coffee so high to the brim that when the lid goes on, it creates this fucking vacuum
[682.15s -> 688.01s]  that sucks up the coffee and pushes it out of the top. Cause there's a bunch of ice in it. And I
[688.01s -> 692.41s]  don't know if it's like a cooling to heat rises. I have no idea, but they make, they fill it to
[692.41s -> 698.97s]  the brim so high that it's just obnoxiously high. And then they go, and when you grab it and you
[698.97s -> 703.85s]  go over it and you put your straw in, you get sprayed by coffee because there's pressure in
[703.85s -> 713.43s]  there somehow. Well, I got coffee sprayed. Like it was like, if you work at a coffee shop, you gotta
[713.43s -> 720.63s]  go like three or four centimeters under the line. Come on. And I'm just sitting there going like,
[720.63s -> 728.14s]  now what do I do? Now what do I do? Right? It wouldn't spray all over your shirt. Well, it was
[728.14s -> 732.14s]  like, and I'm like, oh shit. And it started dripping down, down, drip, drip, drip, drip,
[732.14s -> 736.70s]  drip. And I'm like, oh, it was very, very fast. You can't react fast like that.
[740.60s -> 750.10s]  Sorry for giving you more coffee. I guess that's not customer error. That's called the coffee was
[750.10s -> 763.40s]  filled too high to the top and it sprayed me customer error. You got extra coffee. No, I got
[763.40s -> 768.84s]  extra ice because what they do with a lot of these coffee shops is they dump a fucking whole
[768.84s -> 774.90s]  cooler worth of ice in your drink. And then they pour like three shots of fucking liquid in there.
[775.83s -> 780.87s]  And then over the course of a day or of a few hours or whatever, or an hour, your ice melts
[780.87s -> 785.43s]  and fills the rest of the drink up. It's just ice. You drink an ice. That's why you say no ice or
[785.43s -> 794.38s]  you say light ice, please. If you don't say light ice, you get a, you get like a tailgating party
[794.38s -> 802.33s]  worth the fucking ice in your drink. Light ice. Then they go, you know, normal. Anyways, that's
[802.33s -> 807.98s]  a great outfit. That's the outfit that I wear every day. Oh, this is during the, the, the Werma.
[808.62s -> 815.03s]  There we go. See, there we go. Dragon breath. There it is. Those of you that remember this stream,
[815.03s -> 827.06s]  this is from the dreams stream, which I took, took the defeat there that I, I couldn't really do it.
[829.85s -> 835.85s]  Why did you create me, Jeremy? I think this is based on the Garfield stuff, right? You know,
[835.85s -> 842.60s]  that's Werma. It's, it's horrifying. This is exactly what it looked like. This is not, I mean,
[842.60s -> 851.66s]  this is, this is an artist representation of Werma, but it's 100% accurate. And just in the
[851.66s -> 862.30s]  case you felt like sleeping tonight, here's the German scorpion. You can't stop me, Jeremy.
[866.12s -> 873.27s]  That's fucked up. Yeah, it is. Those of you that have played a certain video game, this is Ludwig.
[874.23s -> 884.60s]  That's what I see. It's great. That's from dragon breath. Thank you. These are great.
[884.60s -> 896.79s]  Very well done. This is my, they said this is my fursona. Frog. Yeah, that's right. I don't know,
[896.79s -> 902.39s]  I don't know, I don't know who that is. Is that, that's supposed to be me with the star wars shirt
[902.47s -> 921.61s]  on. Frogs don't have fur. I don't give shit. That's my frog soda. Fireman, take a look.
[922.55s -> 932.68s]  This is Clown Fireman. I mean, that's perfect. Timely, timely as well. Look at this dude.
[934.90s -> 942.28s]  He's so cute. I know. Fireman is, is the most adorable character, I think, that exists.
[943.43s -> 946.63s]  You could make a whole franchise around Fireman. You could have like, you could have like a
[946.63s -> 955.82s]  children's tv show. You could have a platformer that they could teach like safety and shit.
[958.95s -> 965.38s]  Fireman walks into like rooms and like lights shit on fire and then tells you like, this is
[965.38s -> 979.00s]  what you have to do. You're monetizing memes. Look out for this dude. Sell out the character,
[979.00s -> 986.31s]  will till we hate it. No, why would I do that? Fire Marshall Bill. And there's another one here
[986.31s -> 1006.62s]  too. Look at that. It's just beautiful. But why is he so sad? What happened? Why is he so, why,
[1006.62s -> 1018.90s]  what happened? Just crying because he's sad. This is a meme. Oh, because I sold him out. No,
[1018.90s -> 1028.10s]  I didn't. Now this one in particular, for one second I was like, oh shit, there's somebody
[1028.10s -> 1035.96s]  naked here, but it's all right. This was, this is a banner that was made for the whole Jerma Rumble
[1036.44s -> 1044.89s]  pretty much over the years, I guess. It's awesome. We got Batboy up here, the egg.
[1045.53s -> 1049.21s]  Now let's see if I know, let's see if I know my own character universe.
[1051.45s -> 1062.73s]  His uh, wall dad, super green screen, Charlie uh, cheese nips, Pac-Man, 30s, Milkman, the egg, me,
[1063.37s -> 1075.53s]  Batboy, Demon Bloods, Raxos, Sonic the Pencil, uh, Captain Cheez-It, right? Oh fuck, who's that?
[1075.53s -> 1084.20s]  Salad Fingers? No, what, did I put Salad Fingers in a rumble? Oh, Frogman from Dark Souls,
[1084.20s -> 1092.28s]  Frogman from Dark Souls, right? Frogman, this super Jax. Uh, there's the VR guy, a little bit
[1092.28s -> 1097.48s]  of background here. VR guy is my, probably like top three favorite characters I've ever made in a
[1097.48s -> 1102.49s]  video game. That whole thing, that the whole thing just was perfect for me. I loved every second of
[1102.49s -> 1110.17s]  it. That's VR guy. Uh, Garfield, Miserable Mikey, uh, Dr. Roker, Dr. Roker's pizza, haven't eaten one.
[1113.06s -> 1121.54s]  VR, why, why VR guy? Because he was on a wireless VR headset and just was playing a VR game and
[1121.54s -> 1126.25s]  didn't know he was in a wrestling event. That's my favorite character. Are you making fun of my
[1126.25s -> 1137.45s]  favorite character? Uh, there's grandpa, obviously, there's me again. Look at how deep, I love, I love
[1137.45s -> 1145.05s]  the, all right, here we go. I don't know shit about art, but here we go. I like the smoothness. I like
[1145.05s -> 1153.03s]  the, the almost, um, I love the smoothness of the palette. What am I trying to say? I love the,
[1154.50s -> 1161.19s]  it's like sanded almost. It's like sanded wood. I love the sanded wood look here. Take a look at
[1161.19s -> 1171.78s]  us, you know what I mean? It looks great. So we got Blue Man, uh, Mr. Sneak Man. Everybody has a man.
[1171.78s -> 1180.98s]  Everyone's man or boy. I'm coming to that realization right now. Uh, this is Bia, Bia, Bia 38,
[1180.98s -> 1188.36s]  by the way, I don't think I know my own characters. That's Bia 38. Uh, Dick Dastlely Richard.
[1188.36s -> 1203.93s]  Oh fuck, I don't know his name. Chuck, Chuck Schnauz, right? Chuck Schnauzwell, that's the one.
[1203.93s -> 1207.37s]  And that's the bottom half of the two person horse. I got it. And we had 10 community subs
[1207.37s -> 1215.72s]  just come in from Soft33. Thank you. Soft33, appreciate that. 10 subs. Congratulations to
[1215.72s -> 1221.00s]  those who got them. And thank you for the giant sub drop. Really. Thanks a lot. Forgot Frogman.
[1221.00s -> 1229.24s]  Well, I don't, I just, it's been a while. This is fantastic, Bill. It was awesome. And then
[1229.24s -> 1234.71s]  there's another one right after this one. I remember this one. I did, I've shown a couple
[1234.71s -> 1241.03s]  of these already on stream, but Jesus, some of these are so fucking good. You have to just look
[1241.03s -> 1253.02s]  at them again. You nailed it. It's a police sketch. That's the best damn police sketch
[1253.02s -> 1269.98s]  I've ever seen in my life. Uh, no, this is great. I love the, it almost looks like it was,
[1270.62s -> 1275.00s]  you know what I'm saying? You did the whole thing and then it was like,
[1275.64s -> 1288.39s]  whatever that's called. I love the smoothness of it. It's dope. I mean, you know what I'm saying? I
[1288.39s -> 1296.76s]  love, I love the tapping of it. I love the tapped smeared tapped on the cheeks. You know what I'm
[1296.76s -> 1302.09s]  saying? Like see here, it's like a, I can, I know exactly how your hand moved when you did this,
[1302.09s -> 1316.39s]  by the way. You went like this, like here's the paper. You went like, like, no, what are you
[1316.39s -> 1327.70s]  talking about? This is pencil. I know. But after the pencil was done, you went there with like a,
[1327.70s -> 1336.18s]  like a cloth and you went like, it's fucking fantastic. It seriously is. Thank you for this.
[1336.82s -> 1351.06s]  And that's me as Spider-Man. The Simpsons. What the fuck? It's like Peter Parker.
[1351.94s -> 1359.05s]  My brain is fucking fried apparently. I don't know why that was instantly, that was instantly
[1359.05s -> 1374.86s]  Peter Parker. They both start with an S. That's the problem. Spider-Man Simpsons. Peter Parker.
[1374.86s -> 1385.03s]  Thanks for drawing me as Peter Parker. No, this is great too. I have no idea why that came out.
[1385.03s -> 1391.96s]  Seriously. By the way, this outfit, I love it. I love the gray. Gray? Here's, I'm going to give
[1391.96s -> 1396.52s]  you, look, those are guys that are like, oh, I need some fashion sense. How do I, help me.
[1396.52s -> 1399.80s]  Well, I don't care. I can't help you up here because this is obviously like a joke, right?
[1399.80s -> 1409.64s]  But for here, gray, gray, black, blue, gray, black, blue, gray top, black jeans, blue sneakers,
[1410.36s -> 1416.04s]  black top, gray jeans, blue sneakers, blue top, black jeans, gray sneakers. Boom. I just did
[1416.04s -> 1422.26s]  your entire wardrobe for the rest of your life. Gray, black, blue, different shades. You could
[1422.34s -> 1430.81s]  have like a navy blue shirt, black pants, black shirt, black pants, black shoes, navy blue shirt,
[1430.81s -> 1451.77s]  navy blue shoes, gray pants, gray shows sweat. They all do. Okay. We're all humans. That's boring.
[1451.77s -> 1464.44s]  No, it's stylish and it's classic. Guys, it's classic. If, if you have the timeless for a reason.
[1465.94s -> 1479.83s]  This is called, this is called when chat is bored. I think too many jupes. There it comes. Can we get
[1479.83s -> 1485.62s]  one? I want one completed one. I want a real completed one or I'm not moving on. I will sit
[1485.62s -> 1489.46s]  here until we go. Somebody got it. They got it. Good. You got, wow. Holy shit. You guys did it
[1489.46s -> 1499.77s]  very easily. That's, I'm surprised you did it that quickly. It's too many jupes, too many jupes. That's
[1499.77s -> 1510.57s]  what we're seeing right now in chat. Stream will be bopping. Remember that one. This is great.
[1511.29s -> 1522.79s]  This one's really good. Yeah. They're all really good, but yeah, this is fantastic. Yeah. This is
[1522.79s -> 1527.66s]  from the game that I don't, I can't even, I can't even tell you the title. I don't know what it is.
[1527.66s -> 1534.38s]  It's something about like existence is, existence is futile or whatever. Resistance is futile.
[1534.38s -> 1542.22s]  That's the Borg from Star Trek. It's something like that. You'll find it. Type in the word like
[1542.22s -> 1548.63s]  existence into the steam bar and like it'll probably pop up. This is weed game, whatever
[1548.63s -> 1551.59s]  you want to call it. But this is great. This is the very beginning of the game. That's the best
[1551.59s -> 1565.45s]  part of the whole game. What's bopping? What's bopping, gamer? Yeah, that's true. What else we
[1565.45s -> 1570.65s]  got here? But that's great. Thank you. Oh shit. We're zoomed in, but this one is, this one's got
[1570.65s -> 1578.22s]  our, one of our favorite characters. That's an iced coffee. That's fireman enjoying an iced coffee
[1578.22s -> 1584.98s]  while the rat cooks a marshmallow on his head. I mean, this is like, come on, this is genius.
[1587.74s -> 1595.93s]  And I think they're in the desert. So this is probably somewhere in Las Vegas. Hot chocolate.
[1595.93s -> 1604.73s]  Oh, it is a hot chocolate. I thought it was an iced coffee. All right. That's my head cannon.
[1604.73s -> 1609.13s]  That's an iced coffee because he's like fireman. He's got to like cool down with an iced coffee.
[1611.32s -> 1618.06s]  I thought that was ice, like ice coffee. Whatever. But this is, I love it. I love the rat. I love
[1618.06s -> 1628.66s]  the marshmallow. He needs to heat it up. He would die if he drank this. No, he wouldn't. Why would
[1629.46s -> 1635.90s]  he die if he drank this? This is not going to kill him. Why would this kill him? Because it's cold.
[1641.75s -> 1651.05s]  It's too cold. Guys, if there's a fire blazing, like if you have a fire blazing and you pour a
[1651.05s -> 1655.13s]  water on it, you're not going to put the fire out. You're going to, it's going to be like,
[1656.01s -> 1658.49s]  and then just come back. It's not, you're not going to put the whole thing out.
[1660.73s -> 1665.13s]  If you have a big fucking fire in front of you and you take a cup of water this big and you go like
[1665.13s -> 1673.05s]  this, it's going to go and it's not going to put it out. You need a bucket of, if this was a bucket
[1673.05s -> 1685.32s]  of iced coffee, then maybe I would be concerned. Do it. Especially, you know, he, he might be made
[1685.32s -> 1692.74s]  out of grease. So that would just make it worse. If this was a cup of like powder, how do you get
[1692.74s -> 1699.22s]  rid of a grease fire? It's powder, right? Yeah. This was a cup of like talcum powder. Get it away
[1699.22s -> 1711.13s]  from him. Sand. Yeah. Yep. Cover it. Don't go near him. Don't cover him with anything.
[1713.29s -> 1723.93s]  You use milk. Now this is great though. Thank you. This also is a strangely, strangely in like the
[1723.93s -> 1730.25s]  same spot somehow. This says, it's so the curio had cheated death in the cemetery outside Good
[1730.25s -> 1738.46s]  Springs, cheated death once again. And the Mojave wasteland was forever changed. That was odd.
[1738.46s -> 1752.30s]  Michael's trip to Vegas. This is pretty good. Is this a spoiler? Spoiler for what? Wait, is this
[1752.30s -> 1767.35s]  not, is it, is this the end of the, of the game? This is the, this is the game's intro. No, it's
[1767.35s -> 1776.62s]  not. Is this the outro? Is this the game's outro? Uh oh. The game's been up for 15 years. If you
[1776.62s -> 1781.06s]  didn't play it yet, you're not going to play it. And by the way, why have you, why have you not
[1781.06s -> 1789.03s]  played it? It's the best one. It's the first portion of the outro. Let's skip that one then.
[1792.28s -> 1800.01s]  This is a odd, we'll stay on the odd. Odd Michael theme. You know what I really like on this one?
[1800.89s -> 1812.06s]  I like the pixelated graphics. Each beard is a pixel line. I like it. It's, you got the edges
[1812.06s -> 1820.97s]  here. Very pixelated. Nice teeth. I like the beard. It's the, the beard really draws you in.
[1821.69s -> 1825.78s]  When you look at this, what's the first thing you look at? You look bang right at that beard.
[1826.42s -> 1839.26s]  This right here. I haven't shaved, so this still works. Looking good. Thank you for the, uh,
[1839.26s -> 1845.10s]  and we've got the pretzel here too. That's what I like the most. Same artist, I believe, but this
[1845.10s -> 1855.82s]  is Jex. I don't have that much hair though. No, I did. I did have this much hair. I forgot. Do you
[1855.82s -> 1860.94s]  guys remember like two or three years ago how fucking long this was? It came down, it came down
[1860.94s -> 1870.60s]  to like here. It was crazy, but it wasn't nice long. It was just gross long. It was ugly. It was
[1870.60s -> 1878.02s]  just long and to here. I didn't have it layered, so it was just weird looking. Now my hair is a
[1878.02s -> 1885.80s]  mustache. That's fine. I'd probably rather have mustache hair, but this is great. It's got the
[1885.80s -> 1893.83s]  glasses too. What the heck are you talking about? Old man, even bald for 30 years. I hadn't even
[1893.83s -> 1908.57s]  been alive for 30 years, but that's Jex and this was Odd Michael. Good shit. This is me. I did,
[1908.57s -> 1918.95s]  I did this one. Oh, right. This is, this is a part, okay, this is a part two. I have no idea
[1918.95s -> 1925.00s]  what I was doing here. I can't, I don't know. This was supposed to be what? This was Twitch,
[1925.00s -> 1934.82s]  right? And then this is a streamer. Oh, right. This is from, from a couple weeks ago. So I,
[1934.82s -> 1944.54s]  this is me drawing a streamer. This is, Jeremy is my favorite finger YouTuber. What do you do?
[1944.54s -> 1951.00s]  Just go like this. Hey, what's going on guys? Welcome back. Uh, welcome back to, uh, hands
[1951.00s -> 1966.95s]  episode of 415. Yep. That's the one. I'm going to go like this today. Okay. What would that even
[1966.95s -> 1973.08s]  mean? Hand, just, uh, this time a finger. I'm a YouTuber that just finger hand YouTuber.
[1975.05s -> 1979.93s]  He's still got it. He's still got it. Yeah, guys, I don't know. I'm really like trying to think
[1979.93s -> 1985.53s]  about a change here. I've been a, I've been a finger YouTuber for like the last six years
[1986.17s -> 1990.65s]  and I kind of want to move on. I want to move forward. I want to keep the content going.
[1991.45s -> 1995.37s]  So I'm thinking of transitioning into elbow, you know, I know, I know I'm looking at the
[1995.37s -> 1999.77s]  comments right now. No, it used to be so much fucking cooler when you were a hand YouTuber,
[1999.77s -> 2003.45s]  but no, I don't want to elbow is different. I don't know. I don't want that guy. I'm just
[2003.45s -> 2010.23s]  trying to do something different now. You know what I mean? You got, you like, you guys cool.
[2010.23s -> 2016.06s]  I know people can take a while. Maybe just give it like 10 or 12 episodes. Look, I'll do here.
[2016.06s -> 2022.38s]  How about this? Once a week, I'll do a hand and a finger YouTube video, but like I'm going to,
[2022.94s -> 2035.88s]  I'm really into this right now. Uh, anyways, the next image is a continuation of this. I believe
[2035.88s -> 2055.70s]  they drew this. They like interpreted that. Oh, is this supposed to be me? No. Why am, why am I
[2055.70s -> 2071.48s]  being like obeyed? It's me watching your stream vessel. Right. Right. Right. Right. Let's take a
[2071.48s -> 2083.50s]  look. See how accurate it is. Pretty, pretty accurate. This is the fucking thing you hang up
[2083.50s -> 2093.96s]  on the fridge that your three-year-old drew. This is not streamer. This is how is your first day
[2093.96s -> 2101.43s]  of the first grade? Well, this, this, this Mr. Stevenson is really nice and we got to go to
[2101.43s -> 2111.29s]  computers and he turned on all the computers for us. And then I prayed. I played Minecraft.
[2111.29s -> 2116.33s]  Oh, wow. Wait, wait, your T your teachers letting you play video games in school.
[2117.69s -> 2123.53s]  Yeah. I played Minecraft for 10, 20 minutes. I'm going to be writing a letter to that
[2123.53s -> 2132.68s]  fucking superintendent, but I was just great. Thank you. Pull them out of that school.
[2135.88s -> 2144.41s]  Now they, they, they should, they should be teaching children about what should they be teaching kids
[2144.41s -> 2149.03s]  now? What do they teach? What are the, what's in school now? I haven't been in school in a long
[2149.03s -> 2152.39s]  time. What's the, what's like the, what's the first class you take in like middle school?
[2160.30s -> 2165.26s]  Stocks. No, they don't. There's no, I would have signed up for that class in like high school.
[2166.70s -> 2174.18s]  Science taxes. They don't teach you how to do taxes. You want to talk about how fucking
[2174.18s -> 2180.98s]  strange the American educational system is. We have this thing that everybody has to fucking do
[2180.98s -> 2190.62s]  when they get older. When you get to be 15, 14, 15, 16, 17 years old, why are they not teaching
[2190.62s -> 2197.19s]  us how the tax system works? Because you just get a job afterwards and then you just are supposed
[2197.19s -> 2207.29s]  to know who fucking supposed to tell you these things. It would have been really nice to know
[2207.29s -> 2219.59s]  how the credit system worked. But Christopher Columbus drove his boat and found this.
[2220.15s -> 2231.86s]  Okay. How do, what does credit mean? And please help me. I didn't know what credit fucking was
[2232.42s -> 2240.55s]  until I was like, I didn't understand how the system worked until I was like 26. And I would
[2240.55s -> 2251.00s]  imagine that a lot of you guys still don't fucking know. Exactly. That's what I'm saying.
[2251.00s -> 2255.96s]  Why is this not like a subject to teach us skills? Give us like skills that we need. Give us life
[2255.96s -> 2265.32s]  skills. Roll the TV in and show the Christopher Columbus shit on the TV. We'll be way more
[2265.32s -> 2277.11s]  involved in that one. There's got to be like a, an old like magic school bus episode about
[2277.11s -> 2282.31s]  Christopher Columbus. That's 22 minutes long. That's not like eight days worth of reading
[2282.39s -> 2299.58s]  textbooks. Teach me how to do my taxes. Teach me how to live. Does a magic school bus have like a
[2299.58s -> 2312.12s]  taxes episode? That'd be pretty fucking funny if they did. Anyways, sorry. I mean, I just,
[2312.12s -> 2317.27s]  I just want our education. I want, I want people to be, I want our education system to be working.
[2321.67s -> 2341.35s]  German 95 in Cox Cowboy, the slowest upload in the West. What is this? What is that? Is that a brum?
[2342.23s -> 2348.54s]  Am I holding like a brim up? Okay. At Hot Topic, they sell those lamps that are like that, right?
[2348.54s -> 2366.74s]  Is that a lamp? It's a horse. Where's, where's the horse? And who like shaved it? Because there's a
[2366.74s -> 2385.82s]  large chunk missing here. Is this the tail? Is this the horse's tail? And like the horse is like out
[2385.82s -> 2404.50s]  here. This is the horse's mane. Well, what, what is this? Is this like the, that's it looks like a bar.
[2405.22s -> 2438.98s]  Sometimes it's too easy. This is great. This is Glooman. Got you. Please stop. People are
[2438.98s -> 2454.18s]  going to actually think that you're dumb. This is why if only they fucking taught us in school
[2456.22s -> 2460.25s]  zoology, I would have been able to know immediately what the fuck that was.
[2465.27s -> 2477.43s]  Don't blame me. Blame the educational system that I was taught, which was algebra two part two.
[2477.43s -> 2482.87s]  I don't remember a goddamn thing from algebra two part two. Not a thing. I don't even know. I,
[2483.67s -> 2486.63s]  I'm going to close my eyes. I'm going to try to think of one word that came out in that class.
[2487.58s -> 2504.78s]  I can't. Imaginary numbers. And I don't look, math is important, right? But I don't buy
[2505.42s -> 2511.02s]  the whole thing that they used to sell us in those classes. You don't think you're going to use it,
[2511.02s -> 2520.65s]  but you will event. You're going to use it. You don't know you will, but you will. Yeah. When?
[2520.65s -> 2527.53s]  When have I ever done like X parentheses, two plus three brackets? No, we have Excel for that.
[2527.53s -> 2545.35s]  Mrs. Stevenson. This is great. Glooman, by the way, like this is, this is perfect.
[2545.91s -> 2551.21s]  I don't know why I thought that said style Seinfeld. It's like, wow, he fucking nailed it.
[2551.21s -> 2557.72s]  I didn't, there's a Seinfeld style in, uh, uh, soul caliber. That's pretty cool. What does it do?
[2562.30s -> 2568.42s]  And I mean, like this could be like a Seinfeld thing. That's like a Kramer move or something.
[2568.42s -> 2588.28s]  I don't know. Oh, here we go. We've seen these before. I just, uh, that was like, so that was
[2588.28s -> 2595.53s]  such a stretch. Oh yeah, Kramer, when he walked in and he goes like, he does that though. That's,
[2595.53s -> 2601.13s]  okay, that's not a stretch. That's not a stretch. He does that shit. He like opened the doors and
[2601.13s -> 2610.79s]  he like, he would like fucking move his hands around and be like, oh, Jerry. But this is from
[2610.79s -> 2618.70s]  Yan Wen. This is, uh, some great stuff from Yan Wen. Look at me, Jerry, look at me. This, I think
[2618.70s -> 2629.13s]  this is the first one that, uh, Yan Wen ever, uh, thank you, at least on stream. So I can't even,
[2629.13s -> 2635.21s]  man. Uh, but yes, it's fucking fantastic. Yan Wen is incredibly talented as you'll see here.
[2635.21s -> 2648.26s]  This is one of my favorites. This is the, uh, Seagull one. It's so good. It's so detailed.
[2649.06s -> 2657.77s]  It looks first. It looks nice. It's so, yeah, I'll tell you up here. See up here, the effect
[2657.77s -> 2665.53s]  that the wings are flapping is done. It's achieved by like, you take your, you take the palette and
[2665.53s -> 2673.94s]  you take a little bit of a cloth and you like dip it in some water and you go to blur it out. The
[2673.94s -> 2679.99s]  blurred image is representing movement because if you take a photo, if you would take a picture of
[2679.99s -> 2687.05s]  this happening, the frame rate would not be fast enough. Your ISO would need to be, um, closed
[2688.07s -> 2691.91s]  or opened, you know, depending on your, your shutter speed has to, it has to do with it too.
[2691.91s -> 2702.63s]  So if you, you see, this is like a great family photo. Of course stocks are crashing. Like,
[2702.63s -> 2717.94s]  wait, like in real, like in real life. All right. Let's imagine like the Dow drops like 10,000
[2717.94s -> 2732.87s]  points. Someone just comes into Twitch chat and just goes, all right, what happened? Oh, well,
[2736.57s -> 2748.66s]  time to buy gold. This is also from Yan Wen. This is, uh, before the carnival happened. Get
[2748.66s -> 2760.94s]  yourself, get, hey, unfortunately, I was not the clown in that string. That's no, it's, that is,
[2760.94s -> 2774.90s]  that is not a penis. That's a dog or it's a cat. That's, I, that's, I don't know how to make a dog.
[2774.90s -> 2780.94s]  So that's pretty accurate. This is me trying to make a dog. Look at that intense face though.
[2781.74s -> 2792.33s]  I could paint it on eyebrows. I should ask Polly polite, see if she can help me here.
[2793.05s -> 2798.78s]  But they're all, I picked out a few of my favorites there. So they're all, ah,
[2799.66s -> 2803.42s]  damn it. You ever, that ever happened? You ever get like stuck and you have to like,
[2803.98s -> 2810.62s]  that's been happening a lot lately. What's wrong with me? It's me with the rats.
[2811.26s -> 2821.32s]  It happens. Sometimes you just get like a little kink. Uh, it's just me hanging out with my rat
[2821.32s -> 2833.34s]  friends. Go see a chiropractor. I've actually been told that before, but chiropractors are weird
[2833.34s -> 2841.91s]  because 50% of all people say chiropractors are horse shit and they're fake and it's like going
[2841.91s -> 2848.15s]  and getting a psychic reading. And then 50% of people will tell you, I went to a chiropractor
[2848.15s -> 2867.88s]  and it changed my life. So who, what the, who do I fucking believe? I guess if you go to like,
[2867.88s -> 2870.92s]  some people can go to like a psychic reading and that can change your life too. Cause they're like,
[2870.92s -> 2874.36s]  oh, you have money coming in the future and you're like, holy shit, that was awesome.
[2875.08s -> 2884.62s]  I guess that could, that makes sense. I don't know. It scares the shit out of me too. I don't
[2884.62s -> 2889.02s]  know. I feel like, okay, like lie down here and just put your back that way. Okay. Now I'm going
[2889.02s -> 2894.62s]  to turn your body like this and I'm going to put my knee into your back and pull as hard as I can
[2894.62s -> 2902.89s]  this way and snap the other way with my knee and like break your back. Right. And then they like,
[2902.89s -> 2908.25s]  I've seen like, I've seen videos of people that they put them like in this like device,
[2908.97s -> 2913.53s]  they like lock their head like this. And then the guy takes like a thing and like puts it around
[2913.53s -> 2922.34s]  their head and like pulls it up. Like, and every time I see one of those videos, I just go, I don't
[2922.34s -> 2930.68s]  want to fucking do that. But then somebody will tell me, man, you got to go. You got to go. I'm
[2930.68s -> 2936.63s]  telling you, like, I feel like my, my spine's got like fluid in it now. I'm not going to go.
[2937.19s -> 2942.73s]  I don't want to have like that thing put around my head. It's going to be like medieval torture
[2942.73s -> 2953.98s]  device, but this is great. Me and the rat friends. That's a fireman. He's got underwear on. Relax.
[2953.98s -> 2967.74s]  This is a super fireman, as you can see, powered up in or in mid powering, possibly. Good Lord.
[2971.34s -> 2974.22s]  Yeah. I wonder how many ice coffees it would take to put this one out.
[2975.24s -> 2991.90s]  Right guys. God. And then from the same artist, this is Dick Dastley Richard. I like this a lot.
[2991.90s -> 3000.33s]  I like the, the bag. I like the, the eye slots. It looks, it makes it look more like a mask.
[3001.05s -> 3013.05s]  It's a hand tuber. Yep. Contemplating getting into the hand tuber scene. Did you, did you paint,
[3013.05s -> 3019.91s]  did you do that? That looks, this is really cool. Did you take the media from the game
[3023.98s -> 3030.17s]  and just kind of layer it on here and then go over like around it? That's pretty cool.
[3030.17s -> 3038.26s]  Cause this is, this looks like the game media. That's exactly what I did. Nice. That's awesome.
[3038.26s -> 3042.50s]  And if not, then you came really, really, really almost scarily close to what it actually looks
[3042.50s -> 3057.10s]  like. Very, very cool. This is from the computer doctor stream. So it reminds me of like a Sunday
[3057.10s -> 3066.98s]  morning cartoon panel. Gold plated. Yep. I feel like this should be like a bubble here.
[3067.94s -> 3072.79s]  This is like panel three or something. You gotta make a statement. You do have,
[3072.79s -> 3082.04s]  you gotta make a statement with your computers. Looking for Garfield. Looks like Kramer.
[3084.02s -> 3100.87s]  And I'm doing a Kramer right here. That, this is, that's Kramer. Do I look like Kramer? Maybe.
[3102.02s -> 3111.32s]  Maybe a little. No, I don't think so. Kind of. No, I don't think so. A little. Not really.
[3112.20s -> 3118.41s]  Oh, this is an animation. This person said that they were working on an animation. It's the first
[3118.41s -> 3123.22s]  time they've ever animated anything. And they have a little template that they were working on
[3123.22s -> 3130.34s]  for. This is a pre carnival stuff. And this is just a little bit of a teaser for what might come
[3130.34s -> 3136.34s]  later. And we have a little bit of a look here. They were going to do what I, what I assumed was
[3136.34s -> 3142.55s]  going to be a carnival cartoon with all these little ideas. Does it look real? It just looked
[3142.55s -> 3151.77s]  cool. So I wanted to look at it. I wanted to show it. What's that called? So you guys gotta help me
[3151.77s -> 3155.77s]  out here because I don't know anything about art. What is the thing called when you draw,
[3156.57s -> 3161.61s]  let's say you're going to draw something. And then the first thing you draw is like all the lines,
[3161.61s -> 3165.37s]  like lines, lines, lines, lines, lines, lines, lines, lines, lines, and then over what's,
[3165.37s -> 3173.45s]  what is that like called when you do that on line work, rough sketch? Does it have anything? Does
[3173.45s -> 3183.32s]  it called anything like a rough sketch? Because then you do, you go over it, right? Will we drop
[3183.32s -> 3190.47s]  in frames? No, we're okay. Cause then you go over that and then you delete, you delete the
[3190.47s -> 3199.21s]  layer behind it. Construction lines, early access art. There's like six different terms for it.
[3202.34s -> 3206.84s]  Structured lines. Okay. Yeah. I always found that interesting because it's almost like you,
[3207.96s -> 3211.64s]  you're like building out a skeleton and then you go over the skeleton and then you delete the
[3211.64s -> 3220.63s]  skeleton and you keep adding and then you maybe delete that too. It's a DLC sketch. This is cool
[3220.63s -> 3228.58s]  though. Really cool stuff. That's just me, you know, just, that's just me just looking great.
[3234.70s -> 3246.65s]  Try it. I can't do it. Delete your skeleton. Yeah. I think you got it pretty good. I think
[3246.65s -> 3253.50s]  you got it pretty close. I said my hair is a little longer now, but maybe not before.
[3253.50s -> 3268.18s]  This is Jerma Chad. That's just, that's just Jerma Jerma. Nice work. Here's some donkey donuts
[3268.90s -> 3271.94s]  because you're epic. I don't, I don't know. I still don't understand this.
[3273.14s -> 3283.18s]  Did this, did this come from this channel? It gets blurry. No. Okay. So this is not,
[3283.74s -> 3291.85s]  but the Dunkin Donuts thing. Here's some donkey donut because you're epic.
[3292.57s -> 3309.11s]  The little rat is great. And I got the Twitch logo on it. I feel like this is something you would do
[3309.67s -> 3314.54s]  out of Starbucks. If you were like really, really pretentious about your stream.
[3316.49s -> 3325.45s]  And what's the name? Twitch.tv slash Jerma985. Okay. And they have to write it on there. And
[3325.45s -> 3328.49s]  then you can walk around with it and like you just, people can just see it. I don't know.
[3329.37s -> 3341.02s]  People probably do that. Phylactery, let's just say 5,000 bits, 50 bucks from Phylactery. Phylactery,
[3341.66s -> 3347.66s]  a lot of money. They're the money king at this point. And they say this,
[3347.66s -> 3351.58s]  Hey Jerma, quick question. Do you find it weird that right now your bones are wet?
[3355.50s -> 3359.26s]  No, not at all. Because the bones are just the thing to protect the meat inside.
[3359.98s -> 3363.96s]  That's fine. That the bones are the shield for the marrow that's inside of them.
[3363.96s -> 3370.50s]  I don't care. Do you care when your car gets wet?
[3371.83s -> 3374.39s]  No, the car is the shell protecting the meat inside, which is you.
[3386.26s -> 3396.18s]  I just saw somebody just wrote, he's insane. No, your bones. What do you mean wet? How are they
[3396.18s -> 3408.57s]  wet? Okay. You've got skin, muscle, bone, but what the, is muscle wet? I mean, it's maybe,
[3408.57s -> 3416.26s]  it's maybe damp, like moist, damp. Muscles are not like, they're damp. They're like liquidy, I guess.
[3417.14s -> 3426.65s]  But who cares? Because if we weren't, if we weren't like 76% water, then that's fine. That's a,
[3426.65s -> 3432.92s]  that's the actual question is, is it weird that you are 76% water? I guess, probably.
[3433.64s -> 3437.83s]  But guess what, guys? You want to talk about some weird, fucked up,
[3438.39s -> 3461.61s]  next level meta shit? So is the earth. Weird. This is from the hit and run streams. Bogdanoff's are
[3461.61s -> 3467.70s]  calling. It's from the hit and run, the Simpson stream. This is from the Spider-Man stream.
[3469.34s -> 3476.95s]  If you remember when we played Spider-Man, I did. It was very, very good. It's an interesting
[3476.95s -> 3495.45s]  depiction. It was, you know, Doc Octopus. That was two years ago. Was it? No, it was not. That
[3495.45s -> 3501.62s]  was in, no, that was in Vegas. I've only been in Vegas for a year. That was like five, that was
[3501.62s -> 3507.42s]  like six or seven months ago. That was like three or four months ago. That was not that long ago.
[3508.22s -> 3515.42s]  It was two years ago. Oh, this is great. I think this actually was the thumbnail for that second
[3515.42s -> 3525.21s]  Derma video that was made, I think. It was in December. Right. Trying to figure out his own
[3525.21s -> 3534.78s]  lore. Right, but to be fair, I have an encyclopedia this thick of stuff that I've ever said or done
[3534.78s -> 3545.05s]  on camera. And sometimes you gotta cycle to like the S for Simpsons. Okay, there it is. Thick. Okay.
[3546.49s -> 3560.73s]  This is Glooman and me. This is great. I love this. Okay, much taller than Glooman, as you see.
[3562.42s -> 3569.62s]  We have seen this before, but it's worth showing again. This is the old Derma. New Derma shrunk and
[3572.46s -> 3578.78s]  became... I'm still all right. I'm not going to give you guys any gasoline to dump on that fire.
[3579.42s -> 3585.43s]  Uh, yeah. But this is, we've seen this one before. It's really good shit. I think this is all made
[3585.43s -> 3592.98s]  by the same artist, these two, this one as well. I believe so. Very, very good work. I like the
[3592.98s -> 3602.20s]  background here. It makes the foreground pop. Did you guys know that I was... I swear to God,
[3602.20s -> 3610.25s]  this is not a lie. This is 100% true. I promise you. I fucking 100% promise. I was an art minor
[3611.13s -> 3627.08s]  in college with my degree. My degree is an art minor. Yes, that's true. It is. I need to show
[3627.08s -> 3632.02s]  you. I don't even know where my degree is. I don't think it's even in this house.
[3632.74s -> 3641.06s]  I don't... I don't have my degree. If I ever needed to prove... This is the funniest part.
[3641.06s -> 3644.74s]  If I ever like applied for a job somewhere and they were like, oh, can we like see a copy of your
[3644.74s -> 3652.82s]  degree? I don't fucking have it. Can I like call the... Can you call the college? Is it like sending
[3652.82s -> 3659.14s]  you medical documents? Hey, I need you to fax my medical degree, my documents over. You can do
[3659.14s -> 3664.31s]  that, right? Is there... Is it like a timeline where you can't do that anymore? What if I graduated
[3664.31s -> 3674.42s]  20 years ago? Do they still have it? What if the college... Okay, what if the college
[3675.66s -> 3685.88s]  goes under and doesn't exist anymore? Where can I get it? I should get it now then. I'm going to
[3685.88s -> 3697.18s]  get like five copies of it. Hey, can you send over five copies of my degree just in case you're
[3697.18s -> 3712.79s]  screwed? No, I'll be fine. Back to college I go. The state government should have it too. They have...
[3712.79s -> 3725.38s]  The state government has everybody's degrees? What was your major? Engineering. Oh, look at this
[3725.38s -> 3735.38s]  one. This is a cute picture of me and Kim. You know, Kim is my girlfriend. Those of you that
[3735.38s -> 3744.31s]  might be new, you might not know. And that's me. It's adorable. I'm gonna... I'm gonna hang this
[3744.31s -> 3751.96s]  one up. I'm gonna hang them all up. I'm gonna get them as bumper stickers on my car. No, this is
[3751.96s -> 3763.30s]  great. What I really like here... I'm not gonna say it. No, this is good shit. We've seen this on
[3763.30s -> 3773.40s]  stream before too. What do you mean egomaniac? Hold on. I'm an egomaniac because some...
[3775.16s -> 3779.45s]  What if you... What if somebody took a photo of you and your girlfriend
[3781.18s -> 3785.67s]  and they showed it to you and then you're looking at it? Would somebody come over and say that
[3785.67s -> 3796.10s]  you're an egomaniac? Holy shit, dude. Wait, you took like three... Wait, hold on a minute.
[3796.10s -> 3802.50s]  You went on vacation and you have like 10, 20 photos of you on vacation? You fucking egomaniac.
[3802.50s -> 3807.30s]  Who are those for? I don't know. Why doesn't everybody take pictures? Why doesn't everybody
[3807.30s -> 3821.24s]  do anything? They're for me. If they were insane and had no concept of social standards.
[3821.24s -> 3825.32s]  So me wanting to frame a photo like this and like put it in like, like the fridge or in the
[3825.32s -> 3834.58s]  bedroom or something. This is like a nice moment. No, egomaniac would be if I told you to edit this
[3834.58s -> 3844.65s]  photo and up here write top fucking 500 streamer, wicked sick stream, really talented guy with an
[3844.65s -> 3852.23s]  arrow pointing over here. Like I have you edit it and do that and put that in or I won't put it up.
[3852.23s -> 3870.55s]  That's how you make the difference. Please OP. Edit that, please OP. OP? Oh, original poster, right?
[3871.43s -> 3874.47s]  Now this is good stuff though. Thank you. Let's keep going.
[3887.48s -> 3892.20s]  I just played this. I was over on my other monitor and the video portion's coming up.
[3892.20s -> 3898.23s]  You didn't hear it. I just played that accidentally but the audio was muted.
[3901.77s -> 3905.69s]  There's a video portion coming up here in a little bit and that is the first one.
[3907.85s -> 3914.81s]  Anyways, this is a artist depiction of what that image looks like down here.
[3922.04s -> 3933.69s]  Frame this one. Now this is a Halloween mask. This is two steps away from BF Bugleberry.
[3938.90s -> 3946.22s]  It's October. Make 3D print this as a mask. How much would that cost? How much would it cost to
[3946.22s -> 3950.86s]  have a company actually make me like a silicone like 3D printed like actual mask of this?
[3956.02s -> 3968.07s]  Like $150,000? I don't think so. What is it made out of? Is it made out of like silk?
[3968.87s -> 3984.87s]  300 bucks? We'll see. Maybe. This is great though. Thank you. It's good shit. This is from
[3984.87s -> 3990.87s]  the Dragon Lair stream. Please save me. This is, I think it's called German Daphne.
[3992.68s -> 3996.60s]  The cage is locked with the key. The dragon keeps it around his neck to slay. The dragon
[3996.60s -> 4013.69s]  used the magic sword. We saw this I think 150 times. Dragon's Lair.
[4018.74s -> 4026.44s]  That was close to a meltdown stream by the way. That was very close. Like I would say like another
[4026.44s -> 4037.64s]  10% more frustration in that game. I may have lost my mind. It was close. It was a lot of fun
[4037.64s -> 4044.01s]  though. It was. But thank you for this. It's great. That's supposed to be me in the glass tube
[4044.01s -> 4062.06s]  thing. Now this is Jex and I believe this is who made it. This is my Namco light gun. I missed that.
[4062.06s -> 4068.22s]  I should have signed it. I should have signed that and like cut the cord off, signed it,
[4068.22s -> 4073.83s]  and put it up in my entryway. Just to like have like look at that piece of like history.
[4074.87s -> 4089.46s]  Fucking egomaniac. This is Vinnie, right? It's a little gif. It'd be padding. That's Vdub.
[4090.76s -> 4102.76s]  Oh okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. One of these days maybe they'll team up. I don't know
[4102.76s -> 4113.77s]  though. I can't determine when he's going to come out. Sometimes he just does. Now that's cute. Very
[4113.77s -> 4120.39s]  cool. And then the next one is, I don't know. I don't know the context on these. Learn the
[4120.39s -> 4130.89s]  difference. It could save your life one day. Vinnie the Jerma. But I'm like sweaty and he's
[4130.89s -> 4140.14s]  cool. He's really cool and I'm like sweaty and weird. And then this is Vdub and Jex. Eats veggies
[4140.14s -> 4147.42s]  is cool and has a has a gun. Taller than Jerma. Jex. Totally better than Vinnie at video games.
[4147.42s -> 4160.07s]  So this is Vdub is better than Vinnie. Vdub vapes and just very epic. So wait. So Jex is
[4160.07s -> 4170.42s]  better than Jerma? Is that what we're coming to the conclusion of here? No. No, no, no, no, no,
[4170.42s -> 4176.92s]  no. This is like it's like Vegeta and Goku. You need both of them. Otherwise you're not going to
[4176.92s -> 4189.82s]  be able to take down Frieza. Give me a break. This is not better or this is the this is the version
[4189.82s -> 4201.82s]  of I have to be that. No, no, no, no, no. Need them both. There was what what was the movie?
[4203.10s -> 4209.40s]  What the fuck was the movie or TV show where the person's all their like alter egos came out. They
[4209.40s -> 4219.13s]  had to like um no it's uh the um no not face off what face off is two guys faces switched um
[4219.69s -> 4232.10s]  there's a Zelda game where this happens split no no no no no different Zelda Zelda and the four
[4232.10s -> 4237.16s]  links right like there's like sleepy link and then there's like comedy link and then this like angry
[4237.16s -> 4248.25s]  link right and they like split up does that happen no there's something else too it's not
[4248.33s -> 4256.36s]  snow white the seven dwarfs did not combine into like a mecha dwarf no jimmy neutron
[4262.57s -> 4266.09s]  why would that be so that's too specific i didn't watch jimmy neutron enough to know that
[4270.38s -> 4286.50s]  it's the movie called identity the power rangers identity okay you take that's from teen titans
[4287.99s -> 4296.07s]  no okay every major cartoon has probably done this every major syndicated cartoon television show
[4296.07s -> 4302.23s]  has probably done the you through some weird scientific experiment had like six personalities
[4302.23s -> 4311.26s]  come out of you it just depends on which one you want to name this happens in the muppets
[4312.90s -> 4324.38s]  no it doesn't danny phantom to i'm going to be to me danny phantom episode one and episode 100 of

[4331.37s -> 4338.09s]  the overarching story arc of danny phantom because i saw like five or six episodes of
[4338.09s -> 4342.57s]  danny phantom and they were all the same episode i could i could not take it tell them apart
[4349.13s -> 4357.26s]  i do remember the theme song because it was lit let me do it for you right now if i remember

[4419.94s -> 4429.10s]  this second cutting in line cutting in line with a video no no that's not how it works

[4448.10s -> 4461.05s]  so that's fair enough yeah let's keep going this is uh the ringleader here at germa from the
[4461.05s -> 4469.78s]  carnival stream cotton candy the most terrifying aspect of that whole stream was the cotton candy
[4469.78s -> 4476.76s]  machine i think i talked about it before but the thing was dangerous and of all the things that
[4476.76s -> 4484.34s]  were there they were machines that were shooting uh softballs at me and the thing that was the
[4484.42s -> 4491.67s]  closest thing to me actually getting severely injured was the cotton candy machine we watched
[4491.67s -> 4509.83s]  the footage afterwards and we like that's dangerous frog what about the frog the frog is all right the

[4543.35s -> 4550.36s]  great this is uh i really wish i looked that good because but here's the thing about costumes
[4552.07s -> 4557.75s]  when you buy a costume there's an 80 chance that it's going to be made out of a material
[4557.75s -> 4568.76s]  that's closer to paper than actual clothing so that hat and that robe were they were barely
[4568.76s -> 4574.66s]  caught it was that hat was barely a hat i don't know why it's just cheap cheap cheap shit material
[4575.22s -> 4592.94s]  paper is actually clothing i don't know why this can't make it normal clothes germa venus oh yeah
[4593.74s -> 4603.70s]  it wasn't a top hat it was a brimmed sack perfect description it was it was it was a brimmed sack

[5088.76s -> 5097.19s]  the carnival this is a cute little photo that's a that's a nice image of my perfect three day
[5097.83s -> 5104.28s]  five o'clock shadow timed stubble of course fireman's there the rat what's it why is the
[5104.28s -> 5116.28s]  rat so concerned why is the rat is the rat annoyed that fireman's on my shoulder looks very irritated
[5116.92s -> 5126.02s]  and there's the tent we didn't have a tent but maybe we should have because of the wind but

[5149.34s -> 5159.96s]  representation the somebody i'm sure is putting the clip in i would assume if he hadn't seen it
[5161.00s -> 5167.48s]  uh if you didn't see that stream chat did a wonderful job not winning that game but
[5168.20s -> 5180.30s]  hitting me directly in the face there it is i was there i was there no not the slap
[5182.33s -> 5187.77s]  uh that was awesome though that was an amazing time thank you for everybody for punching me in
[5187.77s -> 5194.66s]  the face now you can say you did that you can say i hit germa in the face and it would not be a lie
[5194.66s -> 5204.28s]  it would be true you won this is from my stardew valley streams this is the duck person from
[5204.28s -> 5218.34s]  stardew valley it was a long time ago what was this what was this character's name yeah this is
[5218.34s -> 5222.87s]  a full probably three or four years ago stardew valley i think is some of the first streams i
[5222.87s -> 5232.54s]  ever did it was greg every character is greg greg is my go-to when i don't have anything to think of
[5232.54s -> 5241.80s]  it's just greg back to bed i do remember that though what a great game what just what a lovely
[5241.80s -> 5250.04s]  experience that was i miss it i kind of did everything though and then kim played it again
[5250.04s -> 5256.04s]  a couple years ago and she 100 percent of the game and i was watching almost the whole time so
[5256.68s -> 5265.05s]  i can't really play it again unfortunately and then after that we have a germa heart
[5265.77s -> 5272.09s]  except this is a little more uh this is a little more morbid this is a germa stab heart
[5273.59s -> 5294.60s]  but it's uh it's really cool nonetheless what monka s why i think it's great i look very angry
[5294.60s -> 5299.21s]  though and this is not even supposed to be me this is supposed to be the person living up here
[5302.14s -> 5315.64s]  if i'm jeremy and jex is jex jerk this is germa the same they all share an apartment up here like in
[5315.64s -> 5320.20s]  my nose like through my nose into my brain this is the front door this is the two hey we got a
[5320.20s -> 5342.98s]  two-car garage here that's expensive oh jesus christ um okay this is this is a i believe this
[5342.98s -> 5350.90s]  is a where's waldo garfield edition is my am i in this somewhere this like hurts to look at
[5354.74s -> 5371.77s]  uh i have no idea anybody see it no that's john but that's not john it's that i'm looking for me
[5372.41s -> 5401.94s]  right oh i don't know what i'm looking for am i looking for me it's just so much orange all right
[5401.94s -> 5417.59s]  i see what is this there's a garfield wheel got it right there that was good that was a pretty good
[5417.59s -> 5430.70s]  one garfield mario is garfield reaching shrek levels right you know exactly what i mean by that
[5432.28s -> 5442.55s]  not yet maybe already already surpassed already was there okay i'm sometimes curious because i'm
[5442.55s -> 5451.82s]  seeing some shrek levels of manipulation here like it's shrek but shrek looks like this now
[5452.70s -> 5459.88s]  it's shrek but mar it's he's got a mario overalls on i mean i put shrek's face on a lasagna
[5462.22s -> 5478.98s]  it's just nests from earthbound but it's it's shrek's face we have reached that point play
[5478.98s -> 5487.35s]  earthbound what are you talking about those are shrek levels of mean creations somebody knows
[5487.35s -> 5492.39s]  what i'm talking about here and that person gets it you know sometimes you just get it
[5499.86s -> 5510.50s]  making the same face that's my shit eating grin i do it all the time free me
[5512.10s -> 5522.66s]  free me that's germa greed then there's a seal and i didn't even know what that was until very
[5522.66s -> 5528.54s]  recently i have no idea what that seal is that seal is on some kind of other completely different
[5528.54s -> 5538.84s]  journey completely new adventure i did not save that seal that seal is doing this has been
[5539.56s -> 5544.90s]  released into our wherever they're going to be they have they're on their own with a new life
[5545.78s -> 5558.22s]  the seal spy no that's just a regular seal but yeah that's from the carnival inside the money
[5558.22s -> 5566.63s]  machine it was a lot of fun and this is great i've seen a few of these this is uh the giant rat
[5566.63s -> 5579.32s]  it's a fair not a giant rat almost as a kingpin i do like the double cigar that's a nice touch
[5581.38s -> 5589.14s]  one for now one for later and this one is the later one as you can see because this one is
[5589.14s -> 5595.88s]  being uh dragged down quite a little bit dual welding cigars how about both for now
[5596.74s -> 5606.04s]  now you'll puke i gotta give you some advice here cigars are horrible because unlike a cigarette
[5606.60s -> 5612.44s]  if you smoke a cigar you are going to throw up because it has so much more concentrated
[5613.40s -> 5620.22s]  power in it it will you will puke if you smoke if you if you like i'm gonna smoke a full cigar
[5620.22s -> 5627.21s]  to my just to my face you'll throw up don't inhale a cigar don't smoke a cigar if you're
[5627.21s -> 5638.71s]  going to smoke a cigar don't breathe it in and don't do enough where you puke just don't smoke
[5638.71s -> 5647.08s]  that's easy you taste it and then spit it out just don't smoke don't smoke cigars don't be like this
[5647.08s -> 5657.16s]  guy he's got two you don't want to do one somebody just wrote something so so incorrect that it's
[5657.16s -> 5671.83s]  making me upset it's a good image though and then a birthday rat it was my birthday recently
[5671.83s -> 5679.27s]  happy birthday right thank you tell us what it is they said no because i don't want to be
[5679.27s -> 5683.19s]  i don't know i don't want to bad i don't want to be the person that is gets attributed this
[5683.19s -> 5689.78s]  shit they said something about it makes you stronger because it makes your lungs work harder to let

[5744.42s -> 5755.90s]  shirt on and the microphone from the carnival dermal wild two emote it's invaded you it's all

[5826.18s -> 5832.22s]  the office here i don't think i'm ever gonna do it i keep thinking of like times where like i might
[5832.22s -> 5847.38s]  do this and it just never becomes a thing just read it read it stream it i can't stream tv shows
[5848.18s -> 5860.58s]  i can't stream that germa can't read this is great though i love it regardless of where this is a
[5860.58s -> 5868.87s]  reference from or two it's it's still a great image now this one this is fucking amazing this
[5868.87s -> 5879.61s]  is a very recent stream the fmv night when i was stuck in the rocket wheelchair for 25 minutes
[5879.61s -> 5886.18s]  it's probably the hardest i've laughed in a long time at least in the last few weeks last month or
[5886.18s -> 5892.71s]  two my game was ridiculous that was from fox hunt i believe that's the game right fox hunt
[5894.38s -> 5911.16s]  that hurt to watch that hurt to watch imagine how much it hurt to play who's but somebody
[5911.16s -> 5919.54s]  eating your pizza what it was hilarious to watch it was it was just an absolute mess but this is a
[5919.54s -> 5928.12s]  this is a fantastic just encompasses the entire stream because it was an absolute joke put a
[5928.12s -> 5931.48s]  clip of me stuck in the chair if nobody saw that then that's a good opportunity for you to see it
[5931.48s -> 5940.57s]  because it was insane nobody has any clips of it oh too bad it's all right and then this is um
[5941.29s -> 5953.06s]  what i don't know why i included this i i this was just there it's i don't know it's like me
[5953.06s -> 5964.54s]  saying i don't know what this is what a perfect image to go after that that it was okay it's
[5965.42s -> 5986.44s]  supposed to be a me doing monkey s as me new emotes no i can't no no no these images in
[5986.44s -> 6020.20s]  succession they tell a story this is me back in my coal mining days you kind of have to double
[6020.20s -> 6026.68s]  take this one because it looks like a real image for a second and then you realize no it's not
[6026.68s -> 6034.20s]  it's not at all actually that was from my vibe stream when the stuff that weird charcoal stuff
[6034.20s -> 6043.29s]  was melting onto my face he hasn't aged a day look at that hair that hair is disgusting
[6049.46s -> 6055.86s]  i have such fine hair though that's the thing i have really fine baby fine hair that even the
[6055.86s -> 6066.65s]  slightest variable turns it to shit i will go out like this okay and i will look like this i'll take
[6066.65s -> 6073.85s]  a step outside and they will be like a six mile per hour wind gust six like maybe five miles per
[6073.85s -> 6083.37s]  hour and it just it turns in a second into just madness like this and i'm constantly like fuck
[6083.37s -> 6093.96s]  god damn it and i don't wear uh gel i don't do like gel or um hair spray i can't because
[6093.96s -> 6097.40s]  when i do hair spray this is the one thing that you need to remember about when you put products
[6097.40s -> 6105.85s]  in your hair you got to get it out because if you sleep in that shit it goes stays in here and goes
[6105.93s -> 6112.65s]  down and just gives you this greasy gross fucking hairline and i just break out all around my whole
[6112.65s -> 6120.38s]  hairline so you have to if you go out and you put product in your hair when you come back you have
[6120.38s -> 6124.94s]  to shower and sometimes that's a pain in the ass because you're tired and how many times have you
[6124.94s -> 6130.70s]  just been like all right it's like it's like 10 11 12 whatever i don't know one two three who knows
[6130.70s -> 6135.10s]  how late it is and then you have to go take a shower when you'd rather just go lie down and go
[6135.10s -> 6147.53s]  to bed i don't i don't put product in my hair at all use the water-based pomade i it doesn't work
[6147.53s -> 6163.35s]  it makes me just look like a sicko not shampoo yeah i shampoo in condition don't go all the way
[6163.35s -> 6169.54s]  to the roots so wait you won't no don't go all the way to the roots so you want to put like
[6169.54s -> 6177.75s]  like hair gel like here and then when the gust of wind comes through this happens are you ready
[6177.83s -> 6189.53s]  if i would do just right here the gust when the gust of wind happens this happens and that's what
[6189.53s -> 6206.20s]  i end up with and it's unfixable his hair is fucked no it's just fine it's really fine and
[6206.20s -> 6211.00s]  it can't i just let it do whatever it's gonna do but i like it like this i like the way it looks
[6211.00s -> 6225.37s]  like this i don't want to like shave it off am i sweating probably i liked it shorter i like it
[6225.37s -> 6231.22s]  short but i like it like this this is this is how i'm gonna wear it and i'm gonna cut it again
[6231.22s -> 6242.15s]  soon i'm a red dead redemption 2 npc oh here is what you mean because i'm curious i don't
[6242.15s -> 6249.99s]  understand how how me are you talking about here okay whoa we're in close but this is uh
[6250.63s -> 6266.94s]  this is one guy whoever you are doing a little dance gif image very cute i do uh and yes for
[6266.94s -> 6273.10s]  the future when we do these again make sure you watermark it just throw a little thing just like
[6273.10s -> 6277.34s]  just even if it's a copy of the image if you don't want to do anything to like the original
[6277.34s -> 6284.20s]  copy the image put a little thing on it just so we know who it is i said i said gif i didn't say
[6284.20s -> 6295.98s]  gif it's a it's a gif it's even i know it's pronounced gif whatever but this is very cute
[6296.54s -> 6332.50s]  this is the fireman gif fireman gif that was glue man and uh me apparently everybody loves fireman
[6332.50s -> 6343.99s]  i love fireman i'm noticing a lot of fireman content it's really cool go back to the gloom
[6343.99s -> 6367.80s]  fine here you go you know how my twitter banner is just this so change it to just this
[6368.92s -> 6389.14s]  it's good stuff though fireman and then we have the rat knight uh is that shovel knight
[6389.70s -> 6402.10s]  that's shovel knight armor it's good shit though it's just it's just a rat it's just it's rat
[6403.24s -> 6414.36s]  it's rat knight or it's rat man that's rocket knight no okay every knight is shovel knight
[6415.56s -> 6426.06s]  yeah just like how every game is dark souls i love it though i love these shoes i love the
[6426.06s -> 6437.69s]  the boots he's ratting us out good shit uh this is the one of the most recent ones this is from
[6437.69s -> 6445.80s]  the numbers going upstream last night um and the joe there's a joke here i'm sure you can figure
[6445.80s -> 6452.46s]  it out uh the actual one of the people that worked on the game made this we showed it last
[6452.46s -> 6470.78s]  night but i want to show it again uh viewers going down yeah don't matter dev in chat no actually
[6470.78s -> 6480.63s]  actually yes but yeah that's good shit thank you for that this also happened last night this
[6480.63s -> 6492.26s]  actually hurts i can't look this hurts my head birthday shito i forgot we did this shit weird
[6492.26s -> 6504.14s]  stream no emotion this is like the vacuum cleaners like oh okay the shito birthday shito
[6509.30s -> 6512.34s]  you know i need to make like i need to have like one of these be like an actual emote
[6513.43s -> 6522.74s]  and that is it that's the last of the artwork or the the drawn or written content good stuff
[6522.74s -> 6534.79s]  there were a lot of them they were very very good and we have a lot more to see if you put
[6534.79s -> 6541.13s]  something this is by the way this is as of last night so this is as of like yesterday so anything
[6541.13s -> 6547.59s]  that was put in there yesterday after i essentially went to bed is not in this stream whatever we
[6548.39s -> 6558.12s]  stop at at that point going forward is where i pull from so uh nerd neck give me one second
[6558.92s -> 6563.24s]  uh that took about two hours all right that's good to know that's good it took about like an
[6563.24s -> 6570.84s]  hour and 45 minutes or so where do you do this in the discord there is a public community discord
[6570.84s -> 6578.76s]  there is a channel called community content nights you put it there this could be there
[6578.76s -> 6583.48s]  are rules there you got to follow those rules it could be a video content it could be um
[6584.28s -> 6589.48s]  photoshopped content it could be original artwork as long as it's put there i will i will go through
[6589.48s -> 6597.56s]  that and that's where i pull it through so we're going to move on to the video portion of the
[6597.56s -> 6603.78s]  stream it should be probably another couple hours or so i would assume uh and there's deep fakes

[7566.57s -> 7569.57s]  Side by side comparison video.
[7569.57s -> 7576.67s]  I don't know how you make this video.
[7576.67s -> 7579.70s]  Okay, here we go.
[7579.70s -> 7580.70s]  Get Out Of Town.
[7580.70s -> 7591.58s]  You didn't actually do this whole thing.
[7591.58s -> 7598.75s]  Wait, don't I like strip?
[7599.75s -> 7612.09s]  Do you have to do all the movement?
[7613.09s -> 7614.65s]  Please don't.
[7623.20s -> 7624.20s]  I can't.
[7637.41s -> 7638.84s]  I can't.
[7639.84s -> 7648.80s]  This is supposed to have taken you a long time to do this.
[7656.42s -> 7663.01s]  It's all my fault.
[7664.01s -> 7668.45s]  Neck breaking.
[7668.45s -> 7696.40s]  Why would you make this?
[7696.40s -> 7708.62s]  It is the same.
[7708.62s -> 7709.62s]  The same.
[7709.62s -> 7711.62s]  It is actually the same video.
[7712.62s -> 7721.58s]  Even the looking back and forth.
[7721.58s -> 7723.58s]  Even the looking back and forth.
[7723.58s -> 7726.36s]  He's like...
[7726.36s -> 7728.92s]  Oh, he's autoplaying.
[7728.92s -> 7729.92s]  SNL.
[7730.92s -> 7732.92s]  I can watch this part here.
[7732.92s -> 7734.92s]  The most unbelievable part to me is...
[7735.92s -> 7738.67s]  Watch the comparison video.
[7738.67s -> 7740.67s]  Watch the actual video.
[7740.67s -> 7741.67s]  The left and right look right here.
[7741.67s -> 7742.67s]  Here it comes.
[7742.67s -> 7752.42s]  You had to have studied this for like 12 hours to do that.
[7752.42s -> 7756.51s]  That was fucking insane.
[7756.51s -> 7763.68s]  Good acting all around.
[7763.68s -> 7766.94s]  A 12 hour stream.
[7766.94s -> 7767.94s]  Holy shit.
[7767.94s -> 7770.94s]  That was called Get Out Of Town Side By Side Comparison.

[7775.66s -> 7776.66s]  Oh no, we already got it, right?
[7776.66s -> 7777.66s]  Somebody just spam them.
[7777.66s -> 7779.66s]  Just link them when they're done.
[7779.66s -> 7781.66s]  Just because I don't have to fucking...
[7781.66s -> 7782.66s]  I don't have to do it.
[7782.66s -> 7790.27s]  He's an egomaniac.
[7791.58s -> 7795.80s]  This is warm now.
[7795.80s -> 7800.15s]  That's not even a link.
[7800.15s -> 7801.15s]  Alright, I'm just going to do it.
[7801.15s -> 7802.15s]  Somebody got it.
[7806.59s -> 7807.59s]  My stomach hurts from laughing.
[7807.59s -> 7809.59s]  We're just getting started, by the way.
[7809.59s -> 7811.86s]  Give them a like.
[7811.86s -> 7813.86s]  I'm not even logged in.

[7818.85s -> 7819.85s]  You do it.
[7819.85s -> 7822.41s]  Fucking unbelievable.
[7822.41s -> 7824.71s]  You guys just keep getting better.
[7824.71s -> 7826.71s]  That's the scary thing.
[7826.71s -> 7827.71s]  You know what I mean?
[7827.71s -> 7831.95s]  You guys just continue to get better at doing this shit.
[7831.95s -> 7838.12s]  Let's keep going.
[7838.12s -> 7845.41s]  This is called Leaked Trailer For Alien Compact Isolation 2.
[7845.41s -> 7850.78s]  If you're ready, let's kick it off
[7850.78s -> 7852.78s]  and to get an update from our friends
[7852.78s -> 7854.78s]  at one of the most celebrated development studios
[7854.78s -> 7856.78s]  in the world, Bethesda Game Studios.
[7856.78s -> 7858.78s]  Please welcome Studio Head
[7858.78s -> 7860.78s]  and my good friend, Todd Howard.
[7861.78s -> 7870.36s]  Are there any gamers in here?
[7870.36s -> 7872.86s]  Of course there is.
[7874.48s -> 7876.48s]  We've got quite a lineup this year.
[7876.48s -> 7881.42s]  Last year we saw some of the best games
[7881.42s -> 7885.42s]  highly reviewed that we've ever had as a company here.
[7885.42s -> 7887.42s]  And we have you all to thank.
[7887.42s -> 7894.24s]  Our average Metacritic score reached over 58.
[7896.24s -> 7901.44s]  And I find it completely necessary
[7901.44s -> 7905.44s]  to now show you, the fans,
[7905.44s -> 7908.44s]  a brand new experience
[7908.44s -> 7910.44s]  that you won't have anywhere else.
[7910.44s -> 7913.32s]  World Premiere.
[7913.32s -> 7914.32s]  Nobody fucking knew.
[7914.32s -> 7915.32s]  I need to pause it.
[7915.32s -> 7916.32s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[7916.32s -> 7918.32s]  I need to pause it for one second.
[7918.32s -> 7920.32s]  I think this is like the first or second time
[7920.32s -> 7922.32s]  anyone has ever used this footage.
[7922.32s -> 7924.69s]  Nobody used that
[7924.69s -> 7927.69s]  because it has no context for anything.
[7927.69s -> 7934.26s]  The socks, the white socks.
[7934.26s -> 7937.26s]  Now show you, the fans,
[7937.26s -> 7940.75s]  a brand new experience
[7940.75s -> 7943.82s]  that you won't have anywhere else.
[7943.82s -> 7948.88s]  World Premiere.
[7948.88s -> 7951.88s]  So I guess you need to explore in this game.
[7951.88s -> 7953.88s]  There was a crash. Oh no.
[7953.88s -> 7955.88s]  Investigate the mystery of the crash.
[7955.88s -> 7957.88s]  Which is what I plan on doing.
[7957.88s -> 7959.88s]  Let's go ahead and go...
[7959.88s -> 7962.82s]  Oh fuck.
[7962.82s -> 7964.13s]  That's him.
[7964.13s -> 7965.13s]  Can I get away without him seeing?
[7965.13s -> 7967.13s]  That's the main thing that's got to be...
[7967.13s -> 7969.13s]  No, no, he's right behind me.
[7969.13s -> 7971.13s]  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
[7971.13s -> 7973.13s]  If I can make it up these stairs, please.
[7973.13s -> 7975.13s]  It's an alien.
[7975.13s -> 7977.13s]  It's a fucking alien.
[7977.13s -> 7980.14s]  Where is he? Where'd he go?
[7980.14s -> 7985.64s]  The doors are all locked.
[7985.64s -> 7987.64s]  I'm trapped in this spooky game.
[7987.64s -> 7988.64s]  What do I do?
[7988.64s -> 7989.64s]  Oh, I guess I could climb in here.
[7989.64s -> 7990.64s]  It's an old video.
[7990.64s -> 7993.07s]  Turn my flashlight on.
[7993.07s -> 7994.07s]  An achievement. Nice.
[7994.07s -> 7995.07s]  You know, I love getting achievements.
[7995.07s -> 7997.07s]  Especially when...
[7997.07s -> 7998.07s]  There he is. There he is again.
[7998.07s -> 7999.07s]  He's in the vent.
[7999.07s -> 8000.07s]  He's in the vent. He's in the vent.
[8000.07s -> 8001.07s]  Get out of the vent.
[8001.07s -> 8002.07s]  Out of the vent. Down the stairs.
[8002.07s -> 8003.07s]  Through the metal detectors.
[8003.07s -> 8005.07s]  Hopefully I don't have any weapons.
[8005.07s -> 8007.07s]  Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[8007.07s -> 8009.07s]  Straight down, straight down, straight down the stairs.
[8011.07s -> 8012.07s]  Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[8012.07s -> 8013.07s]  I know you can hide.
[8013.07s -> 8014.07s]  Hide in here.
[8014.07s -> 8015.07s]  Open it.
[8015.07s -> 8017.07s]  Okay.
[8017.07s -> 8018.44s]  Shh, quiet in here.
[8018.44s -> 8019.44s]  I don't want to...
[8019.44s -> 8021.44s]  If I make any noise, I'm going to be in a lot of trouble.
[8021.44s -> 8023.44s]  God, there he is.
[8023.44s -> 8025.74s]  Please don't come in here and kill me.
[8025.74s -> 8028.11s]  What the fuck is he doing?
[8028.11s -> 8032.19s]  That's psycho.
[8032.19s -> 8033.19s]  What is it?
[8033.19s -> 8034.19s]  Do you eat ass?
[8034.19s -> 8036.58s]  Do you eat ass?
[8036.58s -> 8037.58s]  Oh, that's the archive.
[8037.58s -> 8039.58s]  If you're ready, let's do the...
[8042.66s -> 8043.66s]  I was going to say this one more time.
[8043.66s -> 8045.66s]  Are there any gamers in here?
[8045.66s -> 8047.47s]  Of course there is.
[8047.47s -> 8050.61s]  That's my favorite part.
[8050.61s -> 8051.98s]  Oh.
[8051.98s -> 8055.22s]  That was a leaked trailer for Alien Compact Isolation 2.
[8055.22s -> 8064.43s]  It's just me.
[8069.05s -> 8070.05s]  Okay.
[8070.05s -> 8071.05s]  We need a link for that one.
[8071.05s -> 8072.05s]  All right.
[8072.05s -> 8073.05s]  I'll get you a link.
[8073.05s -> 8075.05s]  I'm going to be lightheaded by the end of this stream, I swear.
[8075.05s -> 8078.06s]  I'll get you a link.
[8078.06s -> 8080.74s]  I don't want you to see how many videos are left, though.
[8080.74s -> 8083.07s]  You know what I mean?
[8083.07s -> 8085.07s]  I don't want you to see how many videos are left.
[8085.07s -> 8088.66s]  That spoils everything.
[8088.66s -> 8096.94s]  All right.
[8096.94s -> 8099.18s]  So this next one is...
[8099.18s -> 8102.93s]  This is German95GermAnimatedFanArt.
[8102.93s -> 8104.93s]  This is actually ridiculous.
[8104.93s -> 8105.93s]  You guys ready for this?
[8105.93s -> 8107.93s]  It's a very short video, but check this out.
[8107.93s -> 8115.71s]  That's like Slimer from Ghostbusters.
[8115.71s -> 8122.75s]  That's a real 3D shit.
[8122.75s -> 8128.26s]  It's really impressive.
[8128.26s -> 8135.68s]  I like the lighting inside the mouth.
[8135.68s -> 8139.99s]  Look at that.
[8139.99s -> 8140.99s]  Let's do it one more time.
[8140.99s -> 8147.44s]  The tongue coming out of the mouth.
[8147.44s -> 8148.44s]  What made the Simpsons writing...
[8148.44s -> 8149.44s]  I don't know.
[8149.44s -> 8150.44s]  What made the Simpsons writing so special?
[8150.44s -> 8152.44s]  Maybe you'll find out one day.
[8152.44s -> 8153.44s]  Here's a link to that one.
[8153.44s -> 8155.44s]  It's called the German95GermAnimatedFanArt.
[8155.44s -> 8160.07s]  Here it is.
[8160.07s -> 8161.07s]  Yeah, take a look at the top.
[8161.07s -> 8162.07s]  Actually, you can't even see the top.
[8162.07s -> 8163.07s]  Oh, fuck yeah.
[8163.07s -> 8164.07s]  There is it.
[8164.07s -> 8166.21s]  I'm not going to...
[8166.21s -> 8169.21s]  No, we have like 40 videos to watch.
[8169.21s -> 8171.21s]  I'm not watching a Simpsons breakdown
[8171.21s -> 8175.21s]  of why the writing degraded after season four.
[8175.21s -> 8178.22s]  You could put that on a playlist
[8178.22s -> 8180.22s]  and listen to it in your car.
[8180.22s -> 8181.58s]  All right.
[8181.58s -> 8182.58s]  Let's keep going.
[8182.58s -> 8189.74s]  Coming up next is Germa and the...
[8189.74s -> 8190.74s]  This is a Dreams level.
[8190.74s -> 8191.74s]  I think we've already seen this,
[8191.74s -> 8192.74s]  but I want to show it one more time
[8192.74s -> 8193.74s]  because it's crazy.
[8193.74s -> 8196.74s]  This is Germa and the Bee from Dreams.
[8196.74s -> 8198.94s]  A game that I abandoned
[8198.94s -> 8200.94s]  because I was not good at it.
[8200.94s -> 8207.10s]  Turned up.
[8207.10s -> 8211.74s]  Guide the bee to Germa's iced coffee
[8211.74s -> 8212.74s]  within 30 seconds.
[8212.74s -> 8213.74s]  Are you serious?
[8213.74s -> 8224.98s]  Holy shit, there's a bee in here.
[8224.98s -> 8226.98s]  Star Wars.
[8226.98s -> 8227.98s]  I didn't even pick up.
[8227.98s -> 8231.98s]  The Star Wars is just text floating in front of me.
[8231.98s -> 8235.12s]  That's so funny.
[8235.12s -> 8237.12s]  You can't get it on a shirt.
[8237.12s -> 8253.76s]  Bumping into stuff?
[8253.76s -> 8259.54s]  What's...
[8259.54s -> 8260.54s]  Who's up in smoke?
[8260.54s -> 8261.54s]  You see that?
[8261.54s -> 8262.54s]  Look at these pogchamps.
[8262.54s -> 8264.54s]  Oh, he's dead.
[8264.54s -> 8271.74s]  What?
[8271.74s -> 8272.74s]  Are you serious?
[8272.74s -> 8275.81s]  Holy shit, there's a bee in here.
[8275.81s -> 8276.81s]  Oh, fuck me.
[8276.81s -> 8279.50s]  Goodbye.
[8279.50s -> 8280.50s]  Something about a bee,
[8280.50s -> 8281.50s]  it's just...
[8281.50s -> 8282.50s]  It's always scary.
[8282.50s -> 8283.50s]  Always.
[8283.50s -> 8285.86s]  And I know, save the bees.
[8285.86s -> 8288.10s]  The bees are so important to us.
[8288.10s -> 8289.10s]  But they're terrifying
[8289.10s -> 8297.74s]  just because you know what they're capable of.
[8297.74s -> 8299.74s]  The running animation is just like...
[8299.74s -> 8301.75s]  Do you win?
[8301.75s -> 8302.75s]  Do you beat it?
[8302.75s -> 8306.23s]  Get in that iced coffee.
[8306.23s -> 8307.23s]  Let's go.
[8307.23s -> 8309.50s]  Nice.
[8309.50s -> 8321.78s]  What's in the trash can?
[8321.78s -> 8326.10s]  Wait, that's not...
[8326.10s -> 8331.02s]  Wait, that's the coffee cup.
[8331.02s -> 8332.65s]  Oh, that's the cup.
[8332.65s -> 8333.65s]  Right, okay.
[8333.65s -> 8334.65s]  Stupid.
[8334.65s -> 8335.65s]  Idiot.
[8335.65s -> 8336.65s]  Moron.
[8336.65s -> 8337.65s]  Dumb.
[8337.65s -> 8338.65s]  Pathetic.
[8338.65s -> 8339.65s]  Okay, let's keep going.
[8339.65s -> 8340.89s]  That was Germa and the Bee.
[8340.89s -> 8341.89s]  Let's get you a link.
[8341.89s -> 8351.68s]  Very, very good shit so far.
[8351.68s -> 8354.01s]  What do we got next?
[8354.01s -> 8358.02s]  This is Germamari Damacy.
[8358.02s -> 8362.41s]  Apparently it's from an old advertisement for Katamari.
[8362.41s -> 8365.72s]  Let's find out.
[8365.72s -> 8366.72s]  Where is it?
[8366.72s -> 8367.72s]  Where's my guy?
[8367.72s -> 8368.72s]  There he is, right there.
[8368.72s -> 8369.72s]  Where's my guy?
[8369.72s -> 8370.72s]  Where's my guy?
[8370.72s -> 8372.72s]  Get back!
[8372.72s -> 8373.72s]  Come here!
[8373.72s -> 8375.15s]  They dropped it!
[8375.15s -> 8378.25s]  Get out of the fucking way!
[8378.25s -> 8379.25s]  I'm in the middle of a check...
[8379.25s -> 8380.25s]  That's all I hear.
[8380.25s -> 8381.25s]  That's all I hear.
[8381.25s -> 8382.25s]  Shut up.
[8382.25s -> 8383.25s]  Shut up.
[8383.25s -> 8389.22s]  Get in your car.
[8389.22s -> 8390.22s]  Get in your car.
[8390.22s -> 8391.22s]  What?
[8391.22s -> 8392.59s]  What is that?
[8392.59s -> 8394.15s]  I think I was going to catch it.
[8394.15s -> 8395.15s]  Hey, that's right.
[8395.15s -> 8400.49s]  Really?
[8400.49s -> 8401.49s]  Are you serious?
[8401.49s -> 8402.49s]  Shit, it worked.
[8402.49s -> 8403.49s]  Go fuck yourself.
[8403.49s -> 8404.49s]  What's up, man?
[8404.49s -> 8405.49s]  What's up, man?
[8405.49s -> 8408.07s]  What's up, man?
[8408.07s -> 8415.33s]  What's up, man?
[8415.33s -> 8416.33s]  What's up, man?
[8416.33s -> 8417.33s]  What's up, man?
[8417.33s -> 8426.12s]  What's up, man?
[8426.12s -> 8427.12s]  What's up, man?
[8427.12s -> 8432.90s]  What's up, man?
[8432.90s -> 8438.62s]  What's up, man?
[8438.62s -> 8439.62s]  What's up, man?
[8439.62s -> 8440.62s]  What's up, man?
[8440.62s -> 8441.62s]  What's up, man?
[8441.62s -> 8442.62s]  What's up, man?
[8442.62s -> 8443.62s]  What's up, man?
[8443.62s -> 8444.62s]  What's up, man?
[8444.62s -> 8445.62s]  What's up, man?
[8445.62s -> 8446.62s]  What's up, man?
[8446.62s -> 8447.62s]  What's up, man?
[8447.62s -> 8450.40s]  What's up, man?
[8450.40s -> 8451.40s]  What's up, man?
[8451.40s -> 8452.40s]  What's up, man?
[8452.40s -> 8453.40s]  What's up, man?
[8453.40s -> 8454.40s]  What's up, man?
[8454.40s -> 8455.40s]  What's up, man?
[8455.40s -> 8456.40s]  What's up, man?
[8456.40s -> 8457.40s]  What's up, man?
[8457.40s -> 8458.40s]  What's up, man?
[8458.40s -> 8459.40s]  What's up, man?
[8459.40s -> 8460.40s]  What's up, man?
[8460.40s -> 8461.40s]  What's up, man?
[8461.40s -> 8464.11s]  What's up, man?
[8464.11s -> 8465.11s]  What's up, man?
[8465.11s -> 8466.11s]  What's up, man?
[8466.11s -> 8467.11s]  What's up, man?
[8467.11s -> 8468.11s]  What's up, man?
[8468.11s -> 8469.11s]  What's up, man?
[8469.11s -> 8471.25s]  What's up, man?
[8475.30s -> 8476.30s]  I'm in the middle of a cha-
[8476.30s -> 8477.30s]  That's all I hear.
[8477.30s -> 8478.67s]  That's all I hear.
[8478.67s -> 8480.30s]  Shut up.
[8480.30s -> 8485.82s]  Shut up.
[8485.82s -> 8490.05s]  Get in your car.
[8490.05s -> 8492.29s]  That's fucking funny.
[8492.29s -> 8493.29s]  Why am I so mean?
[8493.29s -> 8494.29s]  I'm not.
[8494.29s -> 8495.29s]  I'm just...
[8495.29s -> 8496.59s]  This is the Katamari guy.
[8496.59s -> 8497.59s]  That's not me.
[8497.59s -> 8500.60s]  That was fucking fantastic.
[8500.60s -> 8509.54s]  Here it is.
[8509.54s -> 8512.32s]  What's next?
[8512.32s -> 8513.32s]  Another one of these.
[8518.63s -> 8523.37s]  Suck a fart out of my ass.
[8524.37s -> 8528.14s]  Alright, that was that one.
[8528.14s -> 8529.14s]  It's called S stands for...
[8531.14s -> 8534.66s]  Suck a fart out of my ass.
[8537.17s -> 8539.17s]  Do you want me to even link this one?
[8539.17s -> 8550.57s]  There you go.
[8550.57s -> 8553.57s]  This is the Life and Times of German985.
[8553.57s -> 8564.30s]  Based on the DOS Alter Ego stream.
[8564.30s -> 8571.14s]  Oh, this is my entire life.
[8581.30s -> 8583.30s]  Is this me reaching out to my old self?
[8583.30s -> 8594.10s]  That's me.
[8594.10s -> 8595.10s]  I mean, that is me.
[8595.10s -> 8598.75s]  What happened in this stream?
[8598.75s -> 8611.73s]  What the fuck is this?
[8611.73s -> 8613.73s]  Was this part of the stream?
[8613.73s -> 8626.17s]  He forgot...
[8626.17s -> 8628.17s]  Oh, right, right.
[8628.17s -> 8641.54s]  It's me on the bench.
[8641.54s -> 8643.54s]  Why?
[8643.54s -> 8688.41s]  I had a heart attack on the baseball field and died.
[8688.41s -> 8690.41s]  I remember.
[8691.41s -> 8699.60s]  Thanks for watching.
[8699.60s -> 8709.54s]  That was the Life and Times of German985 from the DOS stream Alter Ego.
[8709.54s -> 8720.43s]  Sometimes I forget all this shit and it's instantly reminding me.
[8720.43s -> 8726.02s]  He got old real quick.
[8726.02s -> 8727.02s]  Yeah.
[8727.02s -> 8728.02s]  34.
[8728.02s -> 8729.02s]  I look like fucking 80.
[8729.02s -> 8732.70s]  What's next?
[8732.70s -> 8734.70s]  Alright, let's keep going.
[8734.70s -> 8739.64s]  This is Vine Wrestle, a German story.
[8739.64s -> 8742.86s]  Alright.
[8742.86s -> 8760.38s]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to Vine Wrestle.
[8760.38s -> 8768.86s]  If this is your first Vine Wrestle, it is the sauciest wrestle event you'll ever see.
[8768.86s -> 8769.86s]  It's Joel.
[8769.86s -> 8775.14s]  Dookie Nookie, Dick Hickam.
[8775.14s -> 8780.45s]  It's time to chew ass, and I'm all out of ass.
[8780.45s -> 8781.45s]  It'll be real good.
[8781.45s -> 8789.64s]  It's been a long-awaited Vine Wrestle.
[8789.64s -> 8792.64s]  It's a sacred Vine Wrestle community event.
[8792.64s -> 8793.64s]  I invaded.
[8793.64s -> 8794.64s]  And you bet.
[8794.64s -> 8796.64s]  It's going to get real exciting.
[8796.64s -> 8799.64s]  Lots of new exciting things happening this year.
[8799.64s -> 8803.48s]  Before we do that.
[8803.48s -> 8812.63s]  Be a part of this wrestling event.
[8812.63s -> 8815.63s]  Because I'm Mr. Wrestling Event.
[8815.63s -> 8816.63s]  That's right.
[8816.63s -> 8817.63s]  German Rumble.
[8817.63s -> 8818.63s]  German Rumble 2.
[8818.63s -> 8819.63s]  German Rumble 3.
[8819.63s -> 8820.63s]  German Rumble Life.
[8820.63s -> 8822.63s]  German Rumble Rumble House.
[8822.63s -> 8823.63s]  The Sims one.
[8823.63s -> 8824.63s]  Nobody really liked that one.
[8824.63s -> 8825.63s]  I did.
[8825.63s -> 8826.63s]  But that's five.
[8826.63s -> 8829.63s]  I got six somewhere, too.
[8829.63s -> 8831.64s]  I do.
[8831.64s -> 8832.64s]  Somewhere.
[8832.64s -> 8835.80s]  Stop moving.
[8835.80s -> 8836.80s]  Stop the moves.
[8836.80s -> 8837.80s]  This is important stuff.
[8837.80s -> 8842.75s]  Boom.
[8842.75s -> 8843.75s]  I did everything possible.
[8843.75s -> 8858.31s]  I just wanted to come in and prove to the world that I had an enemy to do it.
[8858.31s -> 8860.31s]  I really didn't.
[8860.31s -> 8864.31s]  I really did not mean to do that.
[8864.31s -> 8865.31s]  Listen.
[8865.31s -> 8870.20s]  How do you think I'm going to get out too when you're gone?
[8870.20s -> 8871.20s]  Take me for everything.
[8871.20s -> 8877.10s]  Me out of my own.
[8877.10s -> 8881.00s]  It is time to hit the road.
[8881.00s -> 8883.26s]  Oh, the F.A.W.D.
[8883.26s -> 8884.26s]  The F.A.W.D.
[8884.26s -> 8885.26s]  Belt was fake.
[8885.26s -> 8889.96s]  Hang up on him.
[8889.96s -> 8890.96s]  Hold on.
[8890.96s -> 8892.39s]  Wait.
[8892.39s -> 8893.39s]  Hold on.
[8893.39s -> 8894.39s]  Wait.
[8894.39s -> 8896.46s]  Hang up on him.
[8896.46s -> 8904.14s]  You can hear the Super Mario RPG music in the background.
[8904.14s -> 8905.14s]  Listen.
[8905.14s -> 8908.74s]  Yeah.
[8908.74s -> 8909.74s]  Yeah.
[8909.74s -> 8915.98s]  Those of you that don't know, on the Vine Wrestle, I invaded.
[8915.98s -> 8917.98s]  I was not supposed to.
[8917.98s -> 8920.98s]  I really didn't want to win.
[8920.98s -> 8923.35s]  I just kept winning.
[8923.35s -> 8927.35s]  I just kept winning no matter what they threw at me.
[8927.35s -> 8934.22s]  I won every single time with a fake belt, though.
[8934.22s -> 8936.22s]  I should have known.
[8936.22s -> 8938.40s]  It looked a little weird.
[8938.40s -> 8939.40s]  I should have known.
[8939.40s -> 8941.40s]  He told me it was official, but you know, crayon.
[8941.40s -> 8944.40s]  It was just red crayon on the belt.
[8944.40s -> 8945.40s]  I just thought that's what they did there.
[8945.40s -> 8947.40s]  I was like, oh, this is like a joke.
[8947.40s -> 8949.40s]  They do like, it's a funny joke belt.
[8949.40s -> 8954.46s]  Maybe we'll see it again.
[8954.46s -> 8956.40s]  Maybe we'll see you next time.
[8956.40s -> 8958.79s]  Maybe.
[8958.79s -> 8959.79s]  We'll find out.
[8959.79s -> 8963.34s]  But that was Vine Wrestle.
[8963.34s -> 8964.34s]  It was a great event.
[8964.34s -> 8967.34s]  I was absolutely thrilled to be a part of it.
[8967.34s -> 8969.34s]  And I fucking won.
[8969.34s -> 8970.83s]  This guy.
[8970.83s -> 8971.83s]  I won.
[8971.83s -> 8974.65s]  Let's get you the link to that one.
[8974.65s -> 8978.45s]  Look at me.
[8978.45s -> 8984.02s]  It actually was a true look at me moment without a single doubt in my mind.
[8984.02s -> 8985.02s]  Coming up next.
[8985.02s -> 8990.22s]  This is called, Jerma Gets Back in Shape.
[8990.22s -> 8992.22s]  I'm looking forward to this one.
[8992.22s -> 8994.22s]  I want to see how I do it.
[8994.22s -> 8997.49s]  Do two headphones in for this one.
[8997.49s -> 8998.49s]  Come on.
[8998.49s -> 9024.56s]  What am I thinking?
[9024.56s -> 9050.70s]  How long is this video?
[9050.70s -> 9054.70s]  Do you want to send a car song?
[9054.70s -> 9057.70s]  I don't either.
[9057.70s -> 9064.29s]  Let's get it started right here.
[9064.29s -> 9070.01s]  Preview.
[9070.01s -> 9071.01s]  Preview.
[9076.59s -> 9089.82s]  Preview.
[9089.82s -> 9098.09s]  This is really coffee?
[9098.09s -> 9099.09s]  Jesus.
[9099.09s -> 9112.13s]  That's so loud.
[9112.13s -> 9114.13s]  I almost just ripped my pants.
[9114.13s -> 9116.01s]  Me too.
[9116.01s -> 9118.57s]  I was supposed to rip it out.
[9118.57s -> 9120.57s]  Holy shit.
[9122.57s -> 9124.57s]  I thought you were in jeans.
[9124.57s -> 9125.57s]  To the gym.
[9125.57s -> 9146.26s]  Jerma saves the galaxy.
[9146.26s -> 9147.26s]  What the fuck is this?
[9147.26s -> 9154.14s]  The time has come.
[9154.14s -> 9155.14s]  Wait.
[9155.14s -> 9156.14s]  Hold on.
[9156.14s -> 9157.14s]  Have you ever seen any Marvel movies?
[9157.14s -> 9158.14s]  Don't watch.
[9158.14s -> 9159.31s]  I don't know what this is.
[9159.31s -> 9162.31s]  There is a Marvel movie in here.
[9162.31s -> 9163.31s]  Somebody gets injured.
[9163.31s -> 9164.31s]  Somebody might get hurt.
[9164.31s -> 9165.31s]  Somebody might die.
[9165.31s -> 9166.31s]  But I don't know.
[9166.31s -> 9171.07s]  Oh, wait.
[9171.07s -> 9172.07s]  This is like a Disney movie.
[9172.07s -> 9178.90s]  Let's just get to the part where I'm in it.
[9178.90s -> 9179.90s]  This is a spoiler.
[9179.90s -> 9183.90s]  If you don't want to see Marvel movie spoilers, close your eyes and block your ears for 30
[9183.90s -> 9184.90s]  seconds starting now.
[9184.90s -> 9185.90s]  Do it now.
[9185.90s -> 9186.90s]  Now.
[9186.90s -> 9192.22s]  Now.
[9192.22s -> 9193.22s]  Now.
[9193.22s -> 9194.46s]  I just ripped my pants.
[9194.46s -> 9196.46s]  We don't need to watch anymore at this point.
[9196.46s -> 9198.46s]  I can't do it anymore.
[9198.46s -> 9200.60s]  Hey.
[9200.60s -> 9201.60s]  Hey.
[9201.60s -> 9202.60s]  It's.
[9202.60s -> 9203.60s]  Tim.
[9203.60s -> 9204.60s]  Tim.
[9204.60s -> 9205.60s]  Oh my god.
[9205.60s -> 9206.60s]  It's good to see you.
[9206.60s -> 9207.60s]  Thanks, man.
[9207.60s -> 9208.60s]  Yeah.
[9208.60s -> 9209.60s]  It's great to see you again.
[9209.60s -> 9225.88s]  What are you doing?
[9225.88s -> 9226.88s]  Hey.
[9226.88s -> 9227.88s]  Somebody keep track of my hands.
[9227.88s -> 9231.36s]  Get out of this.
[9231.36s -> 9232.36s]  There's an extra one for you.
[9232.36s -> 9233.36s]  I don't know.
[9233.36s -> 9243.26s]  I'm not even going to link you on that one.
[9243.26s -> 9248.82s]  You'll find it somehow.
[9248.82s -> 9251.82s]  What I'm next is I think we've seen this is called Jerma and the Dark Guy.
[9251.82s -> 9261.01s]  I walk out the door and there's just the there's the dark guy and he's just lined up the shot
[9261.01s -> 9263.01s]  and you're like, OK, go ahead.
[9263.01s -> 9268.44s]  And he's just like, hold on.
[9268.44s -> 9272.44s]  By the way, this happens like two or three times a week.
[9272.44s -> 9277.44s]  After a year, you're going to like kick out of the dark.
[9277.44s -> 9278.44s]  Jesus Christ.
[9278.44s -> 9279.44s]  That was loud.
[9279.44s -> 9280.44s]  You're going to be like, don't fucking get.
[9280.44s -> 9281.44s]  Don't come in my house ever again.
[9281.44s -> 9285.30s]  He's going to look at you like, what?
[9285.30s -> 9286.30s]  Don't don't leave.
[9286.30s -> 9287.30s]  Don't ever come back.
[9287.30s -> 9289.30s]  Get the fuck out of my house.
[9289.30s -> 9292.30s]  And he'll just be like, well, this bag like his bag of fucking darts on his back.
[9292.30s -> 9293.30s]  OK.
[9293.30s -> 9294.61s]  Bye.
[9294.61s -> 9295.61s]  You'll never see me again.
[9295.61s -> 9298.61s]  And you're like, yeah, get the fuck out of here, dark asshole.
[9298.61s -> 9300.61s]  The door closes and he's gone.
[9300.61s -> 9306.61s]  By the way, two months later, a dart hits your like window and you look out, you're
[9306.61s -> 9307.61s]  like that motherfucker.
[9307.61s -> 9310.61s]  And he's just like.
[9310.61s -> 9312.61s]  And he fucking runs away.
[9312.61s -> 9317.47s]  What the hell was I talking about?
[9317.47s -> 9328.38s]  I don't know.
[9328.38s -> 9332.38s]  I can't I cannot tell you what that I can't bring anything out of that for you.
[9332.38s -> 9335.51s]  Just there was a guy that throws darts at you.
[9335.51s -> 9336.51s]  Just watch out.
[9336.51s -> 9337.51s]  Didn't get rid of him.
[9337.51s -> 9338.51s]  He's in your house.
[9338.51s -> 9343.65s]  I don't know why there's a guy throwing darts in your house or what that's alluding to.
[9343.65s -> 9344.65s]  But here's the link.
[9344.65s -> 9347.98s]  It was a metaphor for Cox.
[9347.98s -> 9348.98s]  Oh, I see.
[9348.98s -> 9349.98s]  OK.
[9349.98s -> 9352.05s]  That makes sense.
[9352.05s -> 9353.05s]  What does it?
[9353.05s -> 9355.06s]  Probably not.
[9355.06s -> 9356.49s]  All right, let's go.
[9356.49s -> 9363.49s]  This next one is, oh, we got a chair, chairs, bizarre adventure, golden stream streaming
[9363.49s -> 9365.24s]  gold.
[9365.24s -> 9368.24s]  I think this is like a season five opener or something.
[9368.24s -> 9371.24s]  This is like late season Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.
[9371.24s -> 9372.24s]  I think opening.
[9372.24s -> 9377.24s]  So if you've never just whatever, it's not what I don't at this point, I'm just going
[9377.24s -> 9378.24s]  to press play.
[9378.24s -> 9379.24s]  You know what's about to happen.
[9379.24s -> 9380.24s]  So do what you need to do.
[9397.94s -> 9398.94s]  One guy.
[9399.94s -> 9400.94s]  Looking out for you.
[9400.94s -> 9401.94s]  Really.
[9411.66s -> 9412.66s]  That fucking hat is so bad.
[9415.66s -> 9423.25s]  I've got to get in front of that square and get away from it.
[9442.50s -> 9444.06s]  One guy.
[9473.38s -> 9476.38s]  I don't usually when I see an image of myself, I know where it's from.
[9476.38s -> 9477.38s]  Sort of.
[9477.38s -> 9479.38s]  I don't know where that's from.
[9479.38s -> 9485.83s]  It was Jared Jared's Bizarre Adventure Golden Stream.
[9485.83s -> 9487.52s]  Here you go.
[9487.52s -> 9494.46s]  Why do you love watching yourself so much?
[9494.46s -> 9495.46s]  I don't.
[9495.46s -> 9501.46s]  I love watching other people create scenarios around things I've done.
[9501.46s -> 9503.95s]  It's fucking wonderful.
[9503.95s -> 9506.83s]  He's an egomaniac.
[9506.83s -> 9507.83s]  He's a narcissist.
[9507.83s -> 9510.20s]  Don't ever trust this guy.
[9510.20s -> 9511.20s]  Don't ever trust him.
[9511.20s -> 9517.71s]  All right, let's go.
[9517.71s -> 9519.71s]  This one's called the cool guy contest.
[9519.71s -> 9525.83s]  This is the cool guy contest.
[9525.83s -> 9535.65s]  Alien.
[9535.65s -> 9542.84s]  Contest.
[9542.84s -> 9554.36s]  Have you seen this?
[9554.36s -> 9557.36s]  One day, fast German alien were walking to get burgers.
[9557.36s -> 9578.89s]  What game is this taken from?
[9578.89s -> 9580.89s]  Cool guy.
[9580.89s -> 9583.15s]  That's insane.
[9583.15s -> 9584.15s]  Right there.
[9584.15s -> 9585.15s]  Can you see?
[9585.15s -> 9587.15s]  I can't even hear it.
[9587.15s -> 9588.15s]  Yeah.
[9588.15s -> 9589.15s]  Yeah.
[9589.15s -> 9590.15s]  Yes.
[9590.15s -> 9592.15s]  Yes.
[9592.15s -> 9593.90s]  That's it.
[9593.90s -> 9595.90s]  That's it.
[9595.90s -> 9600.51s]  Purple alien says he's going to win.
[9600.51s -> 9602.51s]  You got something to say?
[9602.51s -> 9604.75s]  Say it again.
[9604.75s -> 9605.75s]  I want to win.
[9605.75s -> 9606.75s]  I want to win.
[9606.75s -> 9607.75s]  I want to win.
[9607.75s -> 9611.25s]  He's gone.
[9611.25s -> 9614.62s]  Who do you think will win?
[9614.62s -> 9658.67s]  Enough fooling around.
[9658.67s -> 9660.67s]  The contest is starting.
[9660.67s -> 9668.38s]  Calculating.
[9668.38s -> 9669.38s]  Calculating.
[9669.38s -> 9670.38s]  Who the fuck are these two?
[9670.38s -> 9671.38s]  Calculating.
[9671.38s -> 9672.38s]  Calculating.
[9672.38s -> 9673.38s]  Fever.
[9673.38s -> 9676.86s]  Steve.
[9676.86s -> 9677.86s]  Fast German.
[9677.86s -> 9678.86s]  Purple alien.
[9678.86s -> 9679.86s]  Frosty.
[9679.86s -> 9685.27s]  Frosty wins the cool guy contest.
[9685.27s -> 9690.54s]  This is terrible.
[9690.54s -> 9694.47s]  Absolutely terrible.
[9694.47s -> 9697.47s]  It appears as though they have misunderstood the contest.
[9697.47s -> 9709.89s]  That was fucking wild.
[9709.89s -> 9713.98s]  That was a dream.
[9713.98s -> 9715.98s]  That was, that was perfect.
[9715.98s -> 9719.12s]  That should be a children's TV show.
[9719.12s -> 9723.05s]  Think about it.
[9723.05s -> 9724.05s]  Maybe.
[9724.05s -> 9726.54s]  We got a lot more to do.
[9726.54s -> 9728.91s]  You thought, yeah, this is a good indicator.
[9728.91s -> 9729.91s]  This is about three hours.
[9729.91s -> 9734.20s]  There's much more to see.
[9734.20s -> 9736.82s]  You guys have just absolutely knocked it out of the park.
[9736.82s -> 9740.45s]  That's why I want to do, I want to do the green screen again.
[9741.45s -> 9747.45s]  Because I feel like so much interesting shit comes out of these green screen videos.
[9747.45s -> 9750.75s]  And when we did the first one, it was like, oh, that was cool.
[9750.75s -> 9751.75s]  Do it again.
[9751.75s -> 9755.75s]  Yeah, I guess I was only going to do it that one time, but I guess we'll do it again.
[9755.75s -> 9758.75s]  And the encore happened recently and it was awesome.
[9758.75s -> 9761.75s]  And then people are still making these things.
[9761.75s -> 9770.19s]  So why not do like another seven hours in front of a green screen and put on more costumes and stuff and give you guys more material?
[9770.19s -> 9773.39s]  Just keep adding more material.
[9773.39s -> 9774.39s]  Maybe.
[9774.39s -> 9780.66s]  It seems like you guys have a lot of fun with this and they're really, really fun to watch on stream.
[9780.66s -> 9787.40s]  Maybe I'll get back in that studio and do it again.
[9787.40s -> 9789.40s]  Making an entire cinematic universe.
[9789.40s -> 9792.11s]  Yeah.
[9792.11s -> 9793.11s]  Something to think about.
[9793.11s -> 9795.57s]  But let's see.
[9795.57s -> 9796.57s]  Did I link that?
[9796.57s -> 9797.57s]  I did, I think.
[9797.57s -> 9798.57s]  Did I link it?
[9798.57s -> 9801.86s]  Just in case I didn't.
[9801.86s -> 9802.86s]  The JCU.
[9802.86s -> 9809.62s]  Just random clips of me puking, pretending to rip my pants and punching the air.
[9809.62s -> 9811.62s]  What a cinematic universe that is.
[9811.62s -> 9815.48s]  Let's go.
[9815.48s -> 9822.34s]  This is called Alex Jones spots a liberal.
[9850.62s -> 9851.62s]  What the fuck.
[9852.93s -> 9853.93s]  Here you go.
[9854.93s -> 9858.38s]  There it was.
[9858.38s -> 9859.38s]  Look at me.
[9862.03s -> 9864.49s]  Coming up next.
[9864.49s -> 9871.81s]  Next is Jerma Shortking. I'm going with that height theme on today's stream.
[9871.81s -> 9882.59s]  Shortking. Why does a scale say 5'1"? A scale does not tell you how tall you are, it tells
[9882.59s -> 9888.30s]  you how much you weigh. That's why it's called a scale.
[9888.30s -> 9893.54s]  I'm five foot something but my bills all pay. All my tippy toes from L.A. to the bay.
[9893.54s -> 9897.66s]  Going off the deep end, chill in the shallow. You don't need your heels girl, just bring
[9898.26s -> 9904.24s]  a towel. I'm five foot something and I'm royalty. Short King Mama A. I'm five foot something
[9904.24s -> 9911.24s]  and I'm royalty. Short King Mama A. They know my speed, it's all the ride. I'm a fun size
[9911.24s -> 9918.24s]  super nice guy. I'm five foot something and I'm royalty. Short King Mama A. Short A. I'm
[9918.52s -> 9927.14s]  five foot something. This is not a real picture. This is a real picture. That's a real picture.

[10284.58s -> 10291.14s]  It's true. Just imagine seeing somebody go, oh no, like pulling their pants and just
[10291.14s -> 10297.41s]  puke. That would be the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.
[10298.45s -> 10304.21s]  I would never get over it. Ever. That would be the only thing I could think of for the rest of my life.
[10308.68s -> 10313.48s]  I'm okay. I'm thinking right now as if I've seen this, I've never seen this, but I'm laughing
[10313.48s -> 10320.93s]  because of it. Now I'm laughing after that. This didn't happen. Guys, but it's true though.
[10321.73s -> 10327.73s]  That you see, if you puke forward, if you are on a roller coaster and you puke forward,
[10327.73s -> 10334.21s]  it's going to spray and hit everybody. Not just one person's vacation. How many people can go on

[10361.64s -> 10374.18s]  puke into your shirt. Don't ruin somebody else's vacation. Don't be the dick that you are throwing
[10374.18s -> 10384.66s]  up. So grab your shirt, lift it up, tilt it so it makes a big cup, and then just puke into your
[10384.66s -> 10393.97s]  shirt. Down. Don't ruin somebody else's vacation. Just puke into your underwear.

[10619.75s -> 10627.06s]  lower the volume. Look at that Kramer. Look at that Kramer. That's a perfect Kramer impression
[10627.06s -> 10661.73s]  right there. This isn't even part of the playlist. Why is it so laggy? I'm not, I'm not pausing it.
[10665.94s -> 10677.64s]  No, we're not just gonna play other videos. I paused it once. All right, I'm unpaused. My hands

[10743.51s -> 10758.71s]  Nice job. Nice work. Take a look at that hat. This hat is not made out of a hat material.
[10758.71s -> 10766.71s]  Same thing with this vest. Direct hit him. It's a critical hit. Yeah, that's a crit.

[10801.91s -> 10809.86s]  we're not gonna watch the full two hours of this. This person made the, okay, so the context here
[10809.86s -> 10814.66s]  is, remember when I talked about if you were just screaming, you turned on a live stream and it was
[10814.66s -> 10822.56s]  just you screaming the full blast for like three or four hours and you just looped it and put it
[10822.56s -> 10827.14s]  and made it, you didn't have a start, you didn't have an end, it just started and ended. This
[10827.14s -> 10909.49s]  person did it. This is my me yelling. Why did I think it was gonna be different? Faster. Faster.
[10909.49s -> 10962.28s]  That didn't do anything. Slower. This is an electric razor. Adventure MF Dan just gave five
[10964.47s -> 10970.31s]  subs. I'm not laughing at that. I'm laughing at what somebody said. Don't laugh for two minutes.
[10970.31s -> 10984.26s]  We're not doing that shit again. I can't, I'm not gonna sit here and do that again. No, no, no, no.

[12154.68s -> 12156.68s]  I'd rather be in that position than be the team to home plate umpire

[12201.88s -> 12203.88s]  it's a fucking soaring home run
[12203.88s -> 12205.88s]  this would go into the ground

[12254.11s -> 12257.44s]  incorrect I just made an incorrect statement
[12257.44s -> 12259.74s]  anyways coming up we have
[12259.74s -> 12261.74s]  we have a twitter video
[12261.74s -> 12263.74s]  twitter video I couldn't figure out how to get to work
[12263.74s -> 12265.74s]  but I'm just gonna try
[12265.74s -> 12267.74s]  so here's the twitter video
[12267.74s -> 12269.74s]  it's from obviously google the gareth
[12269.74s -> 12272.30s]  and this thing has been auto playing
[12272.30s -> 12274.30s]  for the last three and a half hours
[12274.30s -> 12278.01s]  so here we go
[12278.01s -> 12280.01s]  let's see if I can get this to be full screened
[12280.01s -> 12282.01s]  I can
[12282.01s -> 12284.01s]  okay so this is called
[12284.01s -> 12286.01s]  I don't know what this is called
[12286.01s -> 12288.32s]  it's a wine thing
[12288.32s -> 12290.32s]  how upset I am right now
[12290.32s -> 12292.32s]  I've missed the wine convention
[12292.32s -> 12294.32s]  by two hours
[12294.32s -> 12296.32s]  and I bought this special red wine suit
[12296.32s -> 12298.32s]  to prove how much I love wine
[12298.32s -> 12300.32s]  and now what am I supposed to do
[12300.32s -> 12302.32s]  throw it in the trash
[12302.32s -> 12305.90s]  this is a monster from monster hunter
[12305.90s -> 12307.90s]  I can't even put it in words
[12307.90s -> 12309.90s]  how upset I am right now
[12309.90s -> 12311.90s]  I've missed the wine convention
[12311.90s -> 12313.90s]  by two hours
[12313.90s -> 12315.90s]  and I bought this special red wine suit
[12315.90s -> 12317.90s]  to prove how much I love wine
[12317.90s -> 12319.90s]  and now what am I supposed to do
[12319.90s -> 12321.90s]  throw it in the trash
[12321.90s -> 12326.25s]  you just
[12326.25s -> 12328.25s]  you just animate
[12328.25s -> 12330.43s]  no, that was awesome
[12330.43s -> 12332.43s]  awesome awesome stuff
[12332.43s -> 12334.43s]  I don't know how some of you guys do it
[12334.43s -> 12336.73s]  alright the next two
[12336.73s -> 12339.16s]  are
[12339.16s -> 12341.16s]  they're not, I had to put them on my computer
[12341.16s -> 12344.28s]  so
[12344.28s -> 12346.28s]  google the gareth makes great fucking animations
[12346.28s -> 12350.19s]  of course, let's move on
[12350.19s -> 12352.19s]  this one is
[12352.19s -> 12354.19s]  I don't know, it's going to be a surprise for all of us
[12354.19s -> 12358.14s]  because I have no idea
[12374.22s -> 12376.22s]  this is from the same two dates
[12387.80s -> 12389.80s]  oh it's kim
[12389.80s -> 12391.80s]  the best part about this
[12391.80s -> 12402.88s]  is sincerely
[12402.88s -> 12405.05s]  that's like a whole tv show
[12405.05s -> 12408.06s]  but
[12408.06s -> 12410.06s]  those clips are taken over the course of like
[12410.06s -> 12413.00s]  four hours
[12413.00s -> 12415.00s]  looks like you got cancelled after one episode
[12415.00s -> 12420.00s]  like a real tv show
[12420.00s -> 12425.44s]  we lost the fucking license
[12425.44s -> 12428.76s]  not anymore
[12428.76s -> 12430.76s]  alright coming up next, this is the final video
[12430.76s -> 12435.76s]  of the
[12435.76s -> 12438.76s]  this family guy of course
[12438.76s -> 12441.13s]  I don't get this one
[12441.13s -> 12443.37s]  I don't get this one
[12443.37s -> 12445.37s]  somebody's going to have to
[12445.37s -> 12449.79s]  I don't get this
[12458.20s -> 12470.94s]  is this supposed to be me?
[12470.94s -> 12472.94s]  by the way this is called germa chin
[12472.94s -> 12476.01s]  is this a chin joke?
[12476.01s -> 12481.24s]  oh
[12481.24s -> 12484.25s]  oh right okay
[12484.25s -> 12486.25s]  because somebody made me in family guy
[12486.25s -> 12488.25s]  creator dot com whatever
[12488.25s -> 12497.84s]  alright
[12497.84s -> 12499.84s]  that was that
[12499.84s -> 12501.84s]  and that is
[12501.84s -> 12504.97s]  the end of the videos
[12504.97s -> 12506.97s]  there was like an hour and 30 minutes of them
[12506.97s -> 12510.35s]  so now we're going to move on to the music
[12510.35s -> 12512.35s]  there's a couple of tracks that somebody gave
[12512.35s -> 12517.72s]  what a dumb video to go out on
[12517.72s -> 12520.78s]  we're not going out yet
[12520.78s -> 12523.02s]  the stream's not over yet
[12523.02s -> 12525.02s]  there's still a few more things to see

[12586.64s -> 12588.64s]  you guys don't know what it's like to be short
[12588.64s -> 12590.64s]  I take a shower and I'm out of the shower and I'm looking at myself

[12638.64s -> 12640.64s]  no no did I
[12640.64s -> 12642.94s]  oh
[12642.94s -> 12645.82s]  that was fucking awesome
[12645.82s -> 12648.56s]  oh alright let's get to
[12648.56s -> 12650.56s]  the songs there are a few things here let's put the
[12650.56s -> 12652.99s]  camera back on let's get
[12652.99s -> 12654.99s]  this in a spot where
[12654.99s -> 12659.02s]  it needs to be so that
[12659.02s -> 12661.02s]  was kind of it in a way
[12661.02s -> 12664.16s]  I thought I knew it was going to take
[12664.16s -> 12666.16s]  somewhere from like three to four hours
[12666.16s -> 12668.16s]  that's kind of what I was planning
[12668.16s -> 12670.16s]  the length of this one oh yeah I did it earlier
[12670.16s -> 12672.16s]  but gotta do it again
[12672.16s -> 12674.16s]  this is just fucking this is art right now
[12674.16s -> 12676.40s]  so you could
[12676.40s -> 12678.40s]  judging by how long this took
[12678.40s -> 12680.70s]  you can expect them to all
[12680.70s -> 12682.70s]  sort of be this sort of similar length like a three to four
[12682.70s -> 12684.70s]  probably this would be about four hours
[12684.70s -> 12688.92s]  I would assume
[12688.92s -> 12690.92s]  this I could make the camera bigger
[12690.92s -> 12692.92s]  and we'll listen to this couple of music
[12692.92s -> 12698.43s]  tracks to listen to
[12698.43s -> 12700.73s]  don't fucking do that
[12700.73s -> 12705.84s]  some of you did
[12705.84s -> 12708.40s]  alright let's get the music on here
[12708.40s -> 12710.40s]  there are two tracks this is called
[12710.40s -> 12712.40s]  the only good joke is
[12712.40s -> 12717.84s]  the beginning okay
[12717.84s -> 12721.98s]  what do you mean by that though
[12721.98s -> 12725.31s]  the only good joke is in the beginning
[12725.31s -> 12728.38s]  let's see here it comes
[12728.38s -> 12741.29s]  alright
[12741.29s -> 12746.33s]  alright
[12746.33s -> 12748.70s]  I see where you're going
[12748.70s -> 12750.70s]  Michael's mom
[12750.70s -> 12757.04s]  fucking Michael's mom
[12757.04s -> 12759.40s]  is pissed
[12759.40s -> 12774.06s]  here's the link to that one
[12774.06s -> 12780.33s]  did I lose connection to Twitch
[12780.33s -> 12782.33s]  how come I can't see
[12782.33s -> 12791.36s]  I guess I'm still here
[12791.36s -> 12793.66s]  there's that one
[12793.66s -> 12795.90s]  I'm still here
[12795.90s -> 12801.02s]  I'm still here
[12801.02s -> 12803.32s]  I'm still here
[12803.32s -> 12805.69s]  I guess I'm still here
[12805.69s -> 12807.69s]  there's that one and there's another one
[12807.69s -> 12809.69s]  this is called I made this with a clip of the labo
[12809.69s -> 12812.19s]  so this is a Nintendo labo song
[12812.19s -> 12815.20s]  both of these by the way made by the same person
[12815.20s -> 12819.02s]  let's check this one out
[12819.02s -> 12853.90s]  okay we're ready
[12853.90s -> 12874.81s]  didn't make this
[12874.81s -> 12877.44s]  that's pretty good
[12877.44s -> 12879.44s]  what's my soundcloud I don't have one
[12879.44s -> 12881.44s]  I just listen to other talented soundcloud artists
[12881.44s -> 12884.70s]  and go like this
[12884.70s -> 12906.78s]  nice
[12906.78s -> 12909.15s]  you should do one
[12909.15s -> 12911.58s]  that was pretty good
[12911.58s -> 12915.60s]  that was a nice beat
[12915.60s -> 12918.16s]  no emotion for two minutes
[12918.16s -> 12920.16s]  we did that yesterday
[12920.16s -> 12922.16s]  and I lost fucking 1500 viewers
[12922.16s -> 12924.78s]  those people are never coming back
[12924.78s -> 12929.77s]  alright that's the end of that
[12929.77s -> 12933.16s]  I have zero viewers now
[12933.16s -> 12935.53s]  shit
[12935.53s -> 12942.38s]  I don't want to be here anymore
[12942.38s -> 12945.90s]  but before we move on
[12945.90s -> 12949.23s]  I'm going to just hang up for a little bit
[12949.23s -> 12951.72s]  I want to tell you
[12951.72s -> 12954.97s]  that thank you
[12954.97s -> 12956.97s]  first of all for everybody that submitted everything
[12956.97s -> 12959.21s]  you guys are immensely talented
[12959.21s -> 12961.21s]  I am shocked every day
[12961.21s -> 12963.21s]  when new videos new artwork everything comes in
[12963.21s -> 12965.45s]  and this was number one
[12965.45s -> 12967.45s]  so I think
[12967.45s -> 12969.45s]  I think it was a success I think this is a cool idea
[12969.45s -> 12971.45s]  I think this is a better idea
[12971.45s -> 12973.76s]  than just showing this stuff
[12973.76s -> 12975.76s]  at the very end of a livestream
[12975.76s -> 12978.00s]  when the wind down happens
[12978.00s -> 12982.03s]  I think this is a much better idea
[12982.03s -> 12984.03s]  tons of great videos tons of great artwork
[12984.03s -> 12986.03s]  my body hurts from laughing at a few of those
[12986.03s -> 12988.65s]  and I'm in awe
[12988.65s -> 12990.65s]  at the sheer amount of talent some of you artists
[12990.65s -> 12992.65s]  can put forth onto a piece of paper
[12992.65s -> 12994.89s]  it's fucking incredible
[12994.89s -> 12996.89s]  so the next community
[12996.89s -> 12998.89s]  content night
[12998.89s -> 13000.89s]  is probably going to be
[13000.89s -> 13005.10s]  whenever there is about
[13005.10s -> 13007.10s]  fourish hours of content
[13007.10s -> 13009.79s]  I think that's a good
[13009.79s -> 13011.79s]  clean community night
[13011.79s -> 13015.36s]  so it's
[13015.36s -> 13017.36s]  when I announced that channel
[13017.36s -> 13020.17s]  about what like a month ago
[13020.17s -> 13022.17s]  that was like just about what thirty
[13022.17s -> 13026.20s]  thirty five days ago something like that
[13026.20s -> 13028.20s]  I would say probably like once every once a month
[13028.20s -> 13030.20s]  it'll probably happen and if there's not enough
[13030.20s -> 13032.20s]  for like to fill because I see how many tabs
[13032.20s -> 13034.20s]  here I'm going to see I'm going to count
[13034.20s -> 13036.20s]  how many videos there were how many pictures there were
[13036.20s -> 13039.85s]  to see how long it took to go through it
[13039.85s -> 13042.16s]  so you'll see
[13042.16s -> 13044.16s]  hopefully once a month if not that then every other month
[13044.16s -> 13048.57s]  we'll do like a just a night like this
[13048.57s -> 13051.32s]  so should be good
[13051.32s -> 13054.33s]  after this stream it'll be full in a week
[13054.33s -> 13056.33s]  then we'll have plenty of stuff to go
[13056.33s -> 13058.96s]  through so that should be good
[13058.96s -> 13061.96s]  who are you talking to we're not real
[13061.96s -> 13063.96s]  zero so wait what is going on
[13063.96s -> 13066.27s]  what is going on with twitch right now if I go
[13066.27s -> 13068.27s]  to twitch.tv does nobody have any viewers
[13068.27s -> 13070.27s]  is it zero viewers across the whole website
[13070.27s -> 13075.88s]  or is it just me everybody
[13075.88s -> 13079.21s]  uh oh uh oh
[13079.21s -> 13081.21s]  everybody has zero
[13081.21s -> 13083.52s]  viewers it's all been a lie
[13083.52s -> 13085.52s]  from the very beginning
[13085.52s -> 13089.42s]  it's all it's been a sham you're all
[13089.42s -> 13094.22s]  not real wake up
[13094.22s -> 13096.22s]  wake up wake up wake up wake up
[13096.22s -> 13105.18s]  wake up didn't work it's real
[13105.18s -> 13107.93s]  I knew it no I think that's um
[13107.93s -> 13110.17s]  I think that's a good cap
[13110.17s -> 13112.99s]  I think that's a good cap for the night
[13112.99s -> 13116.06s]  I could what time is it five thirty
[13116.06s -> 13118.06s]  four hours yeah
[13118.06s -> 13122.22s]  I think that's a good cap for the night
[13122.22s -> 13126.76s]  so I will see you guys I'm trying
[13126.76s -> 13134.89s]  to sleep over here baldo
[13134.89s -> 13136.89s]  no I'll see you guys um I'm not
[13136.89s -> 13138.89s]  I have to do some stuff
[13138.89s -> 13141.52s]  so the next time you see me will probably be
[13141.52s -> 13144.01s]  Monday Monday I have
[13144.01s -> 13146.01s]  I actually have I'm doing my
[13146.01s -> 13148.70s]  ultrasound on Monday so
[13148.70s -> 13151.07s]  I'll still be live on Monday
[13151.07s -> 13153.07s]  Monday after I go to the doctor's
[13153.07s -> 13156.33s]  appointment they need to
[13156.33s -> 13158.33s]  they need to look and look at my
[13158.33s -> 13160.33s]  they look at my gallbladder is what they do
[13160.33s -> 13162.33s]  my mother had her gallbladder removed
[13162.33s -> 13164.33s]  uh and so
[13164.33s -> 13166.33s]  I'm having like abdominal
[13166.33s -> 13168.33s]  problems and they think that
[13168.33s -> 13170.33s]  I might have to it might be that
[13170.33s -> 13172.33s]  I don't know we'll see
[13172.33s -> 13174.33s]  but uh I will stream after that
[13174.33s -> 13176.33s]  that's gonna happen earlier in the day
[13176.33s -> 13178.33s]  uh I don't think
[13178.33s -> 13181.08s]  I might have to stream later
[13181.08s -> 13183.08s]  around like three or four
[13183.08s -> 13185.08s]  just because I'll be there at the appointment
[13185.08s -> 13187.45s]  earlier in the afternoon
[13187.45s -> 13189.45s]  is your gallbladder a boy or a girl
[13189.45s -> 13194.32s]  but thank you again
[13194.32s -> 13196.32s]  for watching pretty good turnout
[13196.32s -> 13198.32s]  I'm glad everybody thought it was fun I did
[13198.32s -> 13200.32s]  I thought it was fucking hilarious and
[13200.32s -> 13202.32s]  uh awe inspiring
[13202.32s -> 13205.63s]  so my fucking gallbladder
[13205.63s -> 13207.93s]  we are gonna move
[13207.93s -> 13211.05s]  out to here does it work
[13211.05s -> 13213.05s]  does it work does it work I think so
[13213.05s -> 13215.74s]  and
[13215.74s -> 13217.74s]  one no no
[13217.74s -> 13219.74s]  no it's still me
[13219.74s -> 13223.84s]  why is it still me it shouldn't
[13223.84s -> 13226.20s]  be still me I thought I fixed
[13226.20s -> 13229.39s]  it fucking ego maniac
[13229.39s -> 13232.52s]  I know seriously
[13232.52s -> 13237.58s]  god damn it I had mine removed
[13237.58s -> 13239.58s]  it feels better but you have to be careful

[13248.96s -> 13251.32s]  legit so we're gonna take those off

[13405.77s -> 13407.77s]  a time when I was cold and afraid to love but you
[13407.77s -> 13409.77s]  and this whole community have helped me get a more
[13409.77s -> 13412.40s]  positive outlook on life
[13412.40s -> 13416.24s]  and I can never thank you all enough it's really
[13416.24s -> 13420.59s]  great to hear stuff like this is
[13420.59s -> 13423.40s]  just it's why I wanted to do more of these
[13423.40s -> 13427.12s]  types of things it's fun to collectively
[13427.12s -> 13429.93s]  come together and look
[13429.93s -> 13433.71s]  at stuff feels pretty good
[13433.71s -> 13437.29s]  I also love iPods
[13437.29s -> 13444.00s]  thank you though
[13444.00s -> 13446.00s]  I can't see the top donators yeah I know something
[13446.00s -> 13448.68s]  I don't know why
[13448.68s -> 13450.68s]  that's here but it is
[13450.68s -> 13453.23s]  I need to like
[13453.23s -> 13455.23s]  Streamlabs OBS has this
[13455.23s -> 13457.23s]  thing where it says
[13457.23s -> 13459.23s]  the sessions right
[13459.23s -> 13461.66s]  so I have for a source
[13461.66s -> 13463.66s]  it's the sessions top
[13463.66s -> 13465.66s]  subgifter doesn't that mean the stream
[13465.66s -> 13468.41s]  session so why does this
[13468.41s -> 13470.41s]  not work half the time
[13470.41s -> 13475.92s]  it doesn't make any sense is it not
[13475.92s -> 13477.92s]  pulling it from Twitch's end somehow but it's
[13477.92s -> 13482.33s]  a Streamlabs thing I don't know
[13482.33s -> 13486.17s]  maybe it's from the stuff from today
[13486.17s -> 13488.17s]  but it didn't work a few days ago either
[13488.17s -> 13490.60s]  Twitch has had zero viewers right now
[13490.60s -> 13492.60s]  somebody's panicking in that office
[13492.60s -> 13494.60s]  at the Twitch office
[13494.60s -> 13498.38s]  papers are flying around probably
[13498.38s -> 13500.38s]  like three people got fired
[13500.38s -> 13502.38s]  or something it's just like who did it
[13502.38s -> 13513.07s]  the alarms are going off
[13513.07s -> 13516.59s]  zero views
[13516.59s -> 13521.64s]  but thank you iPod Matt appreciate it

[13528.97s -> 13530.97s]  but I skipped Algebra 2 episode 4
[13530.97s -> 13532.97s]  I thought it was a clip show
[13537.76s -> 13539.76s]  Algebra 2 episode 4

[13600.94s -> 13606.64s]  face

[13814.12s -> 13816.12s]  movie you said you might
[13816.12s -> 13818.12s]  join I know just how the
[13818.12s -> 13820.12s]  scales I couldn't get it done for this stream but next
[13820.12s -> 13822.12s]  time you'll get an exclusive trailer and a real Garfield
[13822.12s -> 13824.68s]  face reveal don't
[13824.68s -> 13830.76s]  I already know what Garfield's face looks like
[13830.76s -> 13836.33s]  he's everywhere how's that for a Garfograph
[13836.33s -> 13838.33s]  can you tell Garfield the next community night stream
[13838.33s -> 13840.33s]  is so I have the trailer ready
[13840.33s -> 13842.33s]  probably I would say somewhere between 30
[13842.33s -> 13844.33s]  and 40 days from right now once a month
[13844.33s -> 13850.28s]  here's the thing with projects
[13850.28s -> 13852.59s]  I am currently
[13852.59s -> 13854.83s]  working on
[13854.83s -> 13856.83s]  2 at the moment right now
[13856.83s -> 13859.58s]  remember I told you guys before the carnival happened
[13859.58s -> 13862.52s]  that
[13862.52s -> 13864.52s]  there were going to be more of those
[13864.52s -> 13868.94s]  very very quickly so you can
[13868.94s -> 13870.94s]  expect that
[13870.94s -> 13873.44s]  every couple months every 2 or 3
[13873.44s -> 13875.44s]  months there's going to be something like
[13875.44s -> 13878.25s]  that on this channel not
[13878.25s -> 13880.25s]  carnivals just bigger
[13880.25s -> 13882.25s]  streams that I want to plan and
[13882.25s -> 13886.09s]  spend a lot of time on 2 of them
[13886.09s -> 13888.09s]  are already being worked on right now
[13888.09s -> 13890.09s]  one very much in particular is already
[13890.09s -> 13892.09s]  in the pre-planning stages
[13892.09s -> 13894.09s]  and is hopefully about 2 months away
[13894.09s -> 13898.76s]  maybe a little bit more depending on time
[13898.76s -> 13909.45s]  potentially really
[13909.45s -> 13911.45s]  exciting stuff in the future
[13911.45s -> 13914.01s]  we'll see
[13914.01s -> 13919.13s]  I'm just keeping my mind open
[13919.13s -> 13921.44s]  but look for the next community night
[13921.44s -> 13923.44s]  somewhere in November
[13923.44s -> 13925.44s]  like the first week of November maybe
[13925.44s -> 13929.32s]  something like that
[13929.32s -> 13933.36s]  thanks a lot Garfield
[13933.36s -> 13935.36s]  hey Appleship thanks for the 250 bits
[13935.36s -> 13937.36s]  hey man I'm so insanely happy that you like my drawings
[13937.36s -> 13939.36s]  they were awesome
[13939.36s -> 13941.36s]  thank you so much for the kind words I've got many more on the way
[13941.36s -> 13943.36s]  I hope to see them during the next community stream
[13943.36s -> 13946.28s]  very talented so
[13946.28s -> 13950.32s]  thank you so much
[13950.32s -> 13952.32s]  I missed these from before but I am
[13952.32s -> 13955.00s]  whizbang
[13955.00s -> 13957.31s]  gave 20 community subs
[13957.31s -> 13961.47s]  I am whiz thank you
[13961.47s -> 13963.77s]  20 subs
[13963.77s -> 13965.77s]  and then AdventureMFDamn we got you but you gave 5 community subs as well
[13965.77s -> 13969.21s]  thank you thank you thank you
[13969.21s -> 13972.73s]  it's a shit load of subs
[13972.73s -> 13975.55s]  it is a lot
[13975.55s -> 13980.80s]  appreciate every single one
[13980.80s -> 13982.80s]  I'd ever agree
[13982.80s -> 13985.23s]  for the 300 bits
[13985.23s -> 13987.47s]  Jeremy just want to say what's up
[13987.47s -> 13989.47s]  I finally got an interview for my first job and I'm super nervous
[13989.47s -> 13993.12s]  but I'm finally becoming a big boy
[13993.12s -> 13995.80s]  finally becoming a big boy
[13995.80s -> 13997.80s]  there you go congratulations
[13997.80s -> 14002.01s]  get that job
[14002.01s -> 14004.64s]  go for it don't be nervous
[14004.64s -> 14010.25s]  you're going to do just fine
[14010.25s -> 14013.45s]  good luck whatever it is hope you get it
[14013.45s -> 14020.35s]  you don't got to be nervous
[14020.35s -> 14022.35s]  remember this is something that you want
[14022.35s -> 14024.35s]  this is something you want to do
[14024.35s -> 14032.08s]  so grab it good luck though
[14032.08s -> 14034.08s]  I want to get a goose cab for the 250 bits
[14034.08s -> 14036.08s]  hey Jeremy I'm so glad you like my two home run videos
[14036.08s -> 14038.08s]  so much
[14038.08s -> 14040.08s]  I didn't even expect you to show the Ortiz Grand Slam again
[14040.08s -> 14042.08s]  but I'm glad you did
[14042.08s -> 14044.08s]  thanks for showing my content on stream
[14044.08s -> 14046.57s]  and I hope you continue streaming for a long time
[14046.57s -> 14048.57s]  they were great
[14048.57s -> 14050.81s]  they were fucking hilarious
[14050.81s -> 14053.63s]  absolutely
[14053.63s -> 14055.63s]  something about just super imposed on top of
[14055.63s -> 14057.63s]  Red Sox World Series wins
[14057.63s -> 14059.63s]  and playoff victories
[14059.63s -> 14061.87s]  it's just hilarious to me
[14061.87s -> 14065.39s]  so thank you
[14065.39s -> 14070.19s]  my pleasure
[14070.19s -> 14072.19s]  thank you for the 500 bits
[14072.19s -> 14074.19s]  you didn't read the short story I submitted for the community night
[14074.19s -> 14076.81s]  short story
[14076.81s -> 14083.47s]  short story
[14083.47s -> 14093.07s]  because I was just pulling images out of here
[14093.07s -> 14095.07s]  was there text in here?
[14095.07s -> 14119.71s]  oh there is like there is something right here
[14119.71s -> 14127.00s]  let's have text to speech read this right now
[14127.00s -> 14138.08s]  join the discord if you're not
[14138.08s -> 14150.75s]  that's how you can submit things
[14150.75s -> 14156.04s]  this is a short story
[14156.04s -> 14160.01s]  I believe this is
[14160.01s -> 14162.01s]  this looks like an
[14162.01s -> 14164.01s]  oh this is a spoiler I don't want to read that
[14164.01s -> 14168.49s]  alright let's see
[14168.49s -> 14172.52s]  I'll turn the music off for this one
[14172.52s -> 14174.52s]  hold on this is going to be faster
[14174.52s -> 14179.96s]  that's good right there
[14197.96s -> 14199.96s]  soothing reply of Dr.
[14199.96s -> 14201.96s]  Nelson resisting the urge
[14201.96s -> 14203.96s]  to roll her eyes
[14203.96s -> 14205.96s]  she was a professional and she had seen
[14205.96s -> 14207.96s]  far stranger than this she kept
[14207.96s -> 14209.96s]  telling herself
[14209.96s -> 14211.96s]  she wasn't going to let someone like this
[14211.96s -> 14213.96s]  break her composure
[14213.96s -> 14215.96s]  Dr. Horowitz Saturday
[14215.96s -> 14217.96s]  silently staring across his desk
[14217.96s -> 14219.96s]  Saturday
[14219.96s -> 14221.96s]  Nelson and the patient
[14221.96s -> 14223.96s]  Jeremy as he had been introduced
[14223.96s -> 14225.96s]  well geez gosh
[14225.96s -> 14227.96s]  I mean the voices
[14227.96s -> 14229.96s]  Jeremy laughed, eyes bugging slightly
[14229.96s -> 14232.14s]  they're just voices
[14232.14s -> 14234.14s]  you know, a couple of them
[14234.14s -> 14236.32s]  not that big a deal
[14236.32s -> 14238.32s]  Jeremy has apparently experienced
[14238.32s -> 14240.32s]  over 11,000 voices
[14240.32s -> 14242.32s]  speaking to him at once
[14242.32s -> 14244.32s]  Jeremy winced as the words
[14244.32s -> 14246.32s]  left drive, Nelson's mouth
[14246.32s -> 14248.32s]  but drive, Horowitz
[14248.32s -> 14250.32s]  D-I-D-N-T react at first
[14250.32s -> 14252.32s]  11,000
[14252.32s -> 14254.32s]  yes sir
[14254.32s -> 14256.32s]  no, that's crazy
[14256.32s -> 14258.32s]  that's the sort of thing a crazy
[14258.32s -> 14260.32s]  person would say
[14260.32s -> 14262.32s]  I'm not crazy
[14262.32s -> 14264.32s]  Jeremy sit down
[14264.32s -> 14266.32s]  Jeremy hyperventilating a little
[14266.32s -> 14268.32s]  Saturday back down in the folding chair
[14268.32s -> 14270.32s]  tell me
[14270.32s -> 14272.32s]  Mr. Elbertson
[14272.32s -> 14274.32s]  what do these voices say
[14274.32s -> 14276.32s]  Jeremy remained silent
[14276.32s -> 14278.32s]  and eventually drive
[14278.32s -> 14280.32s]  Nelson spoke up
[14280.32s -> 14282.32s]  it depends sir, but they seem malevolent
[14282.32s -> 14284.32s]  malevolent
[14284.32s -> 14286.32s]  they encourage dangerous behavior
[14286.32s -> 14288.32s]  they award him points for it
[14288.32s -> 14290.32s]  points
[14290.32s -> 14292.32s]  when he hurts people, breaks things
[14292.32s -> 14294.32s]  makes good jokes, they give him points
[14294.32s -> 14296.32s]  and they take them away
[14296.32s -> 14298.32s]  for wholesome behavior and bad jokes
[14298.32s -> 14300.49s]  I see
[14300.49s -> 14302.73s]  do they do anything else
[14302.73s -> 14304.73s]  they like to
[14304.73s -> 14306.73s]  all at once, Jeremy leapt to his feet
[14306.73s -> 14309.42s]  clutching his head and screaming
[14309.42s -> 14311.72s]  will you all shut up
[14311.72s -> 14313.90s]  talking about my feet
[14313.90s -> 14315.90s]  shut the fuck up
[14315.90s -> 14317.90s]  get off this topic
[14317.90s -> 14319.90s]  no more feet
[14319.90s -> 14321.90s]  before either doctor could attempt to pacify him
[14321.90s -> 14323.90s]  the door to the office slammed open
[14323.90s -> 14325.90s]  and security guards charged in
[14325.90s -> 14331.60s]  to restrain the screaming man
[14331.60s -> 14333.60s]  stop saying it
[14333.60s -> 14335.60s]  the big punch line got cut off
[14335.60s -> 14338.73s]  here's the big punch
[14338.73s -> 14342.00s]  right here
[14342.00s -> 14346.86s]  why did this get cut off
[14346.86s -> 14348.86s]  as he was hauled away, drive
[14348.86s -> 14350.86s]  I'm sorry sir
[14350.86s -> 14352.86s]  both SCP-985
[14352.86s -> 14354.86s]  and its host can be rather unpredictable
[14354.86s -> 14356.86s]  there you go
[14356.86s -> 14361.47s]  SCP-985
[14361.47s -> 14365.74s]  there's your punch line there
[14365.74s -> 14367.74s]  alright, we're gonna do the credits
[14367.74s -> 14369.74s]  the actual credits are gonna be probably right in front of my face
[14369.74s -> 14372.43s]  how do we get them here, let's see
[14372.43s -> 14374.43s]  well, we can go like this
[14374.43s -> 14376.43s]  are they gonna be in front of me, or behind me
[14376.43s -> 14379.80s]  we'll find out
[14379.80s -> 14383.26s]  chat's the true monster
[14383.26s -> 14385.44s]  eh, debatable, I think that's debatable
[14385.44s -> 14388.83s]  alright, am I
[14388.83s -> 14390.83s]  I think in front of me, or behind me
[14390.83s -> 14393.77s]  let's find out
[14393.77s -> 14398.12s]  thanks everybody for your support on these streams
[14398.12s -> 14400.68s]  they're in front of me
[14400.68s -> 14402.68s]  all these people subbed today
[14402.68s -> 14404.92s]  during the stream, whether it was from
[14404.92s -> 14407.48s]  a community sub or not
[14407.48s -> 14409.48s]  or you just decided to stay subbed for 36 months
[14409.48s -> 14412.17s]  in a row
[14412.17s -> 14414.92s]  thank you, all of you
[14414.92s -> 14419.08s]  here you all are
[14419.08s -> 14422.03s]  hell yeah, thanks a lot
[14422.03s -> 14424.46s]  we do have a few more bits to do though
[14424.46s -> 14426.46s]  here, I'll put them on a different screen
[14426.46s -> 14429.58s]  we had
[14429.58s -> 14431.58s]  that was Dr. Zutsu by the way
[14431.58s -> 14433.58s]  thanks for the story, sorry I missed it
[14433.58s -> 14435.58s]  when I was pulling stuff out, I was just gonna go in line by line
[14435.58s -> 14437.58s]  videos and pictures
[14437.58s -> 14439.58s]  I didn't see it
[14439.58s -> 14441.58s]  I just kind of squirreled by it apparently
[14441.58s -> 14443.58s]  it was very very very
[14443.58s -> 14445.58s]  very creepy
[14445.58s -> 14447.58s]  and it was a little twisted
[14447.58s -> 14449.58s]  but thank you, and thanks for your 500 bits too
[14449.58s -> 14452.01s]  GTX 1080 quad SLI
[14452.01s -> 14454.01s]  gave 250 bits
[14454.01s -> 14456.57s]  they say
[14456.57s -> 14459.58s]  why don't you do more things with italics
[14459.58s -> 14462.97s]  we just did something like last week
[14462.97s -> 14467.24s]  which is a twitch con
[14467.24s -> 14469.48s]  but to answer that
[14469.48s -> 14471.48s]  a greater question there
[14471.48s -> 14473.48s]  I don't do very much collaborations anyways
[14473.48s -> 14476.62s]  I think
[14476.62s -> 14478.62s]  it's just me
[14478.62s -> 14480.62s]  organically if you want to do a video or a stream together
[14480.62s -> 14482.80s]  I don't
[14482.80s -> 14485.80s]  typically do
[14485.80s -> 14487.80s]  co-streams or multiplayer streams
[14487.80s -> 14489.80s]  sometimes, but for the most part
[14489.80s -> 14491.80s]  if it makes sense
[14491.80s -> 14493.80s]  then yeah
[14493.80s -> 14496.11s]  but
[14496.11s -> 14498.99s]  I typically just do my own thing
[14498.99s -> 14501.48s]  typically
[14501.48s -> 14503.48s]  and yes I have seen the birthday card, it was fucking incredibly wholesome
[14503.48s -> 14505.48s]  and wonderful, thank you
[14505.48s -> 14508.03s]  we went over it
[14508.03s -> 14510.03s]  I'm completely floored
[14510.03s -> 14512.03s]  that there's that many people that want to say
[14512.03s -> 14514.03s]  that fucking nice things about me
[14514.03s -> 14516.97s]  so, I really appreciate it
[14516.97s -> 14519.79s]  words seriously
[14519.79s -> 14521.79s]  cannot describe the feeling
[14521.79s -> 14525.12s]  when I look at stuff like that
[14525.12s -> 14527.12s]  but, no, to answer the larger question
[14527.12s -> 14529.12s]  like I said
[14529.12s -> 14531.12s]  I get questions a lot about
[14531.12s -> 14533.12s]  hey, you should play with Star some more
[14533.12s -> 14535.12s]  what about Kraken and italics
[14535.12s -> 14537.12s]  you should play with Vinny or Joel
[14537.12s -> 14539.12s]  it has to just sort of happen
[14539.12s -> 14541.12s]  it's not like
[14541.12s -> 14543.12s]  I don't typically go out of my way
[14543.12s -> 14545.12s]  to do much
[14545.12s -> 14547.12s]  multiplayer content with people
[14547.12s -> 14549.87s]  and that's sort of just
[14549.87s -> 14552.75s]  I've been doing that for the last
[14552.75s -> 14554.75s]  five years or so
[14554.75s -> 14558.97s]  kind of, you should play with Ninja
[14558.97s -> 14565.18s]  why did I even read that out loud
[14565.18s -> 14569.34s]  why did I read that
[14569.34s -> 14576.83s]  Vinny said you peed your pants and he doesn't
[14576.83s -> 14578.83s]  need that kind of attention
[14578.83s -> 14583.44s]  I did not pee my pants
[14583.44s -> 14589.20s]  the song makes me sad
[14589.20s -> 14591.20s]  why does the song make you sad
[14591.20s -> 14596.00s]  it still hasn't streamed with Joel
[14596.00s -> 14599.64s]  it just
[14599.64s -> 14601.64s]  it just has to happen, you know what I mean
[14601.64s -> 14603.82s]  well that's not true
[14603.82s -> 14606.00s]  that's not true
[14606.00s -> 14609.00s]  we did the whole fine wrestle
[14609.00s -> 14614.00s]  that was a whole thing
[14614.00s -> 14621.80s]  yeah of course it does
[14621.80s -> 14629.16s]  but I typically just kind of do my own thing
[14629.16s -> 14633.32s]  that's kind of the shrug
[14633.32s -> 14636.59s]  you have to take the initiative
[14636.59s -> 14639.79s]  but I kind of just do my own thing
[14639.79s -> 14642.48s]  and I just bump you
[14642.48s -> 14646.49s]  bump you in the face
[14646.49s -> 14652.19s]  that's a big gamer shrug
[14652.19s -> 14655.26s]  to be honest you're much better as a solo act
[14655.26s -> 14657.95s]  I don't
[14657.95s -> 14659.95s]  I don't know if I necessarily agree with that
[14659.95s -> 14662.96s]  but
[14662.96s -> 14664.96s]  I'm like at my most comfortable
[14664.96s -> 14667.45s]  when I can kind of
[14667.45s -> 14669.45s]  just do whatever and kind of say whatever
[14669.45s -> 14671.45s]  and just kind of just be me
[14671.45s -> 14674.65s]  I've actually had this conversation before
[14674.65s -> 14676.65s]  about why won't you do this
[14676.65s -> 14678.65s]  or why you could play with that group or this group
[14678.65s -> 14680.65s]  it's because
[14680.65s -> 14682.65s]  maybe I am a little more comfortable
[14682.65s -> 14684.83s]  solo, maybe it is
[14684.83s -> 14692.51s]  maybe that is what it is
[14692.51s -> 14698.01s]  and obviously with all of you
[14698.01s -> 14700.01s]  I prefer solo less to comprehend from my tiny brain
[14700.01s -> 14705.00s]  my tiny brain
[14705.00s -> 14709.36s]  but I don't know sometimes stuff just randomly comes up
[14709.36s -> 14711.36s]  like for instance like Star
[14711.36s -> 14713.36s]  and Terraria it was just like
[14713.36s -> 14716.17s]  there was no plan there
[14716.17s -> 14718.17s]  it wasn't like oh we're going to do this
[14718.17s -> 14720.17s]  we should do this, we should do this more often
[14720.17s -> 14722.17s]  it was just like I want to fucking play Terraria
[14722.17s -> 14724.17s]  and you do too
[14724.17s -> 14727.95s]  let's do it, let's just play it, let's beat it
[14727.95s -> 14729.95s]  that's just kind of how it works
[14729.95s -> 14734.56s]  and that's how it will continue to work
[14734.56s -> 14738.25s]  what did he say?
[14738.25s -> 14741.52s]  Dermis Sauer
[14741.52s -> 14743.52s]  oh yeah I didn't put that, Dermis lied about it
[14743.52s -> 14745.52s]  no it's not
[14745.52s -> 14747.52s]  I have like four hours to put Dermis Sauer as an emote
[14747.52s -> 14754.24s]  but let's finish this up
[14754.24s -> 14756.60s]  let's get to the end
[14756.60s -> 14758.91s]  we are at the end
[14758.91s -> 14762.94s]  and that means we switch over to the real end
[14762.94s -> 14769.32s]  this one
[14769.32s -> 14771.32s]  we have 250 from Gnarly
[14771.32s -> 14773.32s]  at the end here, thank you
[14773.32s -> 14775.32s]  thanks for showing my Soul Calibur Glueman on stream
[14775.32s -> 14777.32s]  I don't know if I uploaded it right
[14777.32s -> 14779.32s]  but that was supposed to be a whole photo album of characters
[14779.32s -> 14781.32s]  regardless happen to have my shitty Glueman
[14781.32s -> 14783.32s]  next to some really high quality fan art
[14784.32s -> 14788.42s]  that was great
[14788.42s -> 14790.42s]  I don't think other ones popped up
[14790.42s -> 14793.62s]  but it was still awesome
[14793.62s -> 14796.37s]  it was still very very very good
[14796.37s -> 14798.37s]  good shit, I didn't even know that had that good of a character creator
[14798.37s -> 14800.37s]  until somebody told me about it
[14800.37s -> 14802.37s]  I was like damn, cool
[14802.37s -> 14804.87s]  but no it was great
[14804.87s -> 14806.87s]  Freudian Weapon thanks for the 250
[14806.87s -> 14808.87s]  this community content is a great idea
[14808.87s -> 14810.87s]  I'll definitely make some art for the next one
[14810.87s -> 14812.87s]  and good luck with the doctors, be well
[14812.87s -> 14818.29s]  I'm gonna try
[14818.29s -> 14820.29s]  I am gonna try
[14820.29s -> 14823.43s]  I'm not too concerned about it
[14823.43s -> 14826.05s]  but
[14826.05s -> 14828.05s]  there has been
[14828.05s -> 14830.05s]  just a random nagging issue
[14830.05s -> 14833.06s]  that has been around for a while
[14833.06s -> 14835.06s]  and it's not anything to do with my intestinal problems
[14835.06s -> 14837.06s]  at least not that I've been able to
[14837.06s -> 14839.06s]  because I had the colonoscopy, remember?
[14839.06s -> 14841.06s]  that was because of these symptoms
[14841.06s -> 14845.67s]  I wanted to check on a few things
[14845.67s -> 14848.68s]  keep going to see what the hell is going on
[14848.68s -> 14852.71s]  but I mean I feel fine
[14852.71s -> 14854.71s]  I'm okay, I'm fine, I'm not sick or anything
[14854.71s -> 14857.08s]  like I'm just
[14857.08s -> 14859.08s]  there's nothing going on internally there
[14859.08s -> 14861.08s]  that once I find out
[14861.08s -> 14863.08s]  what the hell it is
[14863.08s -> 14865.08s]  just do it, figure it out
[14865.08s -> 14870.18s]  I'm not concerned
[14870.18s -> 14872.18s]  do I have a FODMAP problem?
[14872.18s -> 14874.18s]  that's what they thought it was at first
[14874.18s -> 14876.42s]  but I'm not sure that's what it is
[14876.42s -> 14878.42s]  I get like this bad
[14878.42s -> 14880.42s]  abdominal pain that sits like under my rib cage
[14880.42s -> 14882.42s]  like on my right side
[14882.42s -> 14884.42s]  and it's kind of right in the center
[14884.42s -> 14886.42s]  so they want to do an ultrasound
[14886.42s -> 14888.42s]  on gallbladder and
[14888.42s -> 14890.42s]  check out the organs
[14890.42s -> 14895.48s]  just make sure they're all working properly
[14895.48s -> 14897.48s]  and it's peace of mind too, just to make sure you know
[14897.48s -> 14901.70s]  I want to stay on top of it
[14901.70s -> 14904.20s]  I guess, but thank you Frodeon
[14904.20s -> 14906.20s]  Bala Koala, thank you for the thousand bits
[14906.20s -> 14908.20s]  play more N-G-U
[14911.40s -> 14913.40s]  that's a great game but
[14913.40s -> 14916.28s]  I don't think you'll see that on stream anymore
[14916.28s -> 14919.92s]  we hit him too hard with the frog
[14919.92s -> 14921.92s]  could be irritable bowel syndrome
[14921.92s -> 14924.48s]  well I have irritable bowel disease
[14924.48s -> 14927.04s]  I was diagnosed with colitis
[14927.04s -> 14929.04s]  10 years ago
[14929.04s -> 14931.04s]  maybe a little bit more, like 12 years ago
[14931.04s -> 14933.04s]  the symptoms are different
[14933.04s -> 14935.80s]  they're not the ones that I'm typically used to
[14937.80s -> 14944.64s]  we'll figure it out
[14944.64s -> 14946.64s]  you won't see that on stream anymore
[14946.64s -> 14948.64s]  it's a great game but
[14948.64s -> 14951.91s]  I probably will move on from it
[14951.91s -> 14953.91s]  but thanks for the thousand bits, appreciate it
[14953.91s -> 14956.92s]  Bala Koala
[14956.92s -> 14958.92s]  also C4G, thanks for the 250, hey Jerma
[14958.92s -> 14961.41s]  I did the Ace Attorney video
[14961.41s -> 14963.41s]  I had a bit I wanted to include where the judge
[14963.41s -> 14965.41s]  gavel on the emote only button
[14965.41s -> 14967.41s]  but I was in a rush to finish it in time
[14967.41s -> 14969.41s]  and forgot to include it
[14969.41s -> 14971.91s]  I'm glad people seem to like the video
[14971.91s -> 14973.91s]  even if you won't admit to your crimes
[14973.91s -> 14977.04s]  that's fucking funny
[14977.04s -> 14979.99s]  that's fucking funny
[14979.99s -> 14986.13s]  but
[14986.13s -> 14988.13s]  it still was great regardless of any
[14988.13s -> 14990.13s]  finishing touches, so
[14990.13s -> 14992.13s]  thank you so much for that, it was fantastic
[14992.13s -> 14995.78s]  Superintendent Chalmers, thanks for the 250
[14995.78s -> 14997.78s]  hey Jerma, when you were talking about taxes and whatnot
[14997.78s -> 14999.78s]  I immediately thought of this
[14999.78s -> 15012.58s]  white suburban punk, just like me
[15021.73s -> 15026.71s]  what?
[15026.71s -> 15028.71s]  taxes?
[15028.71s -> 15042.71s]  taxes?
[15042.71s -> 15046.04s]  repo man?
[15046.04s -> 15048.04s]  click on the album, click on the album
[15052.04s -> 15054.66s]  hold on
[15054.66s -> 15056.66s]  don't click on the album, why?
[15056.66s -> 15058.66s]  why why why why why
[15058.66s -> 15060.66s]  what's in it, what's in it, what's in it
[15060.66s -> 15065.84s]  what did you make me click on?
[15065.84s -> 15072.36s]  one fucking guy, it's just
[15072.36s -> 15075.81s]  a one guy
[15075.81s -> 15077.81s]  oh I see the album though, hold on we'll go through this in a second
[15077.81s -> 15079.81s]  let's get to the end of the bits, there's only two more
[15079.81s -> 15081.81s]  two more
[15081.81s -> 15088.47s]  two more
[15088.47s -> 15090.47s]  and they are, that was from
[15090.47s -> 15092.47s]  Superintendent Chalmers
[15092.47s -> 15094.64s]  silent serenity thanks for the 250
[15094.64s -> 15096.64s]  silent serenity right now
[15096.64s -> 15098.64s]  Jerma, I'm not sure if I told this story before but I'm gonna
[15098.64s -> 15100.64s]  so I'm going to, since I was reminded
[15100.64s -> 15102.64s]  of it anyways, years ago when I
[15102.64s -> 15104.64s]  was still in high school I had to write
[15104.64s -> 15106.64s]  a play for English class
[15106.64s -> 15108.64s]  so what did I write about?
[15108.64s -> 15110.64s]  the egg of course
[15110.64s -> 15112.64s]  I adapted the original egg video
[15112.64s -> 15114.64s]  into my script, my teacher loved it
[15114.64s -> 15116.64s]  so I hope you don't mind that I plagiarized
[15116.64s -> 15119.52s]  what did you get for a grade?
[15119.52s -> 15125.22s]  did you get an A?
[15125.22s -> 15127.65s]  because that's only
[15127.65s -> 15129.65s]  okay if you got an A
[15129.65s -> 15134.52s]  if you got a C-
[15134.52s -> 15139.04s]  or worse, then that would
[15139.04s -> 15141.04s]  upset me a little because that means that
[15141.04s -> 15143.04s]  a teacher doesn't understand
[15143.04s -> 15150.53s]  true artwork
[15150.53s -> 15162.74s]  below average
[15162.74s -> 15165.62s]  because it's true art
[15165.62s -> 15169.78s]  is what that is
[15169.78s -> 15171.78s]  but Phylactery gave another
[15171.78s -> 15173.78s]  five thousand bits
[15173.78s -> 15175.78s]  may as well be
[15175.78s -> 15177.78s]  five thousand dollars at this point
[15177.78s -> 15181.43s]  total, thank you Phylactery
[15181.43s -> 15185.01s]  this is another video here
[15185.01s -> 15187.01s]  it's another Jimmy Neutron
[15187.01s -> 15189.01s]  video
[15189.01s -> 15191.76s]  how do you have all these Jimmy Neutron
[15191.76s -> 15193.76s]  clips just ready to go?
[15193.76s -> 15199.20s]  where are you getting the Jimmy Neutron
[15199.20s -> 15220.45s]  clips?
[15220.45s -> 15222.88s]  oh hi Jimmy
[15222.88s -> 15224.88s]  I have to do a report on snails or
[15224.88s -> 15226.88s]  napoleon, can you help me?
[15226.88s -> 15228.88s]  what's the point of doing homework
[15228.88s -> 15230.88s]  we do it and then what?
[15230.88s -> 15233.57s]  poof, we're gone
[15233.57s -> 15235.57s]  emptiness, we're all just dust in the wind
[15235.57s -> 15237.57s]  okay
[15237.57s -> 15239.57s]  I don't want to be dust in the wind
[15239.57s -> 15241.57s]  is that from the thing
[15241.57s -> 15243.57s]  we were talking about?
[15243.57s -> 15245.57s]  he got clipped into
[15245.57s -> 15247.57s]  five different Jimmy Neutrons?
[15247.57s -> 15249.81s]  oh okay right
[15249.81s -> 15251.81s]  like I said every cartoon has done that
[15251.81s -> 15255.91s]  thanks a lot Jimmy
[15255.91s -> 15257.91s]  well not Jimmy Neutron
[15257.91s -> 15264.05s]  Jimmy Neutron did not give me that clip
[15264.05s -> 15266.05s]  I misclicked, hold on
[15266.05s -> 15279.35s]  go back over here
[15279.35s -> 15281.35s]  but thank you Phylactery
[15281.35s -> 15283.35s]  and let's show the images
[15283.35s -> 15285.35s]  of, wait wait wait wait
[15285.35s -> 15287.35s]  somebody link me that image gallery
[15287.35s -> 15289.35s]  again of the
[15289.35s -> 15291.35s]  the characters from Soul Calibur
[15291.35s -> 15293.35s]  thank you
[15293.35s -> 15298.34s]  that is okay
[15298.34s -> 15300.71s]  that's one, that's one, that's one
[15300.71s -> 15302.88s]  alright, let's scroll through this
[15302.88s -> 15316.24s]  in the right spot though
[15316.24s -> 15319.32s]  go back to here
[15319.32s -> 15321.32s]  do a German Rumble special edition
[15321.32s -> 15323.75s]  special edition
[15323.75s -> 15326.18s]  they're all special, anytime
[15326.18s -> 15332.71s]  I'm still on Jimmy
[15332.71s -> 15334.71s]  that's on the stream dashboard
[15334.71s -> 15336.71s]  so, I mean that's incorrect
[15336.71s -> 15338.71s]  I don't know where it's pulling that from
[15338.71s -> 15349.72s]  password leaked
[15349.72s -> 15351.72s]  this is just like the stream bits
[15351.72s -> 15354.85s]  this is from the German Mustard site
[15354.85s -> 15356.85s]  it's way better
[15356.85s -> 15362.80s]  than stream labs
[15362.80s -> 15367.67s]  where

[15481.67s -> 15483.67s]  say the thing
[15483.67s -> 15485.67s]  I can't do it

[15518.90s -> 15520.90s]  and spends time on them
[15520.90s -> 15522.90s]  I know how long these take
[15522.90s -> 15525.97s]  it's deceiving
[15525.97s -> 15527.97s]  please
[15527.97s -> 15532.88s]  I'm going to leave this open
[15532.88s -> 15535.64s]  I'm going to leave this open
[15535.64s -> 15537.64s]  and I'm going to put a blanket behind my computer's fan
[15537.64s -> 15547.49s]  because I feel like it
