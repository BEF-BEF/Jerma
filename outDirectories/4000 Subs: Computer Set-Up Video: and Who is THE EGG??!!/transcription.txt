[1.34s -> 7.66s]  Oh, hello, cats. Hey, what's going on, guys? It's Gerber here for the 4,000 subscriber video.
[7.66s -> 15.05s]  This is my dog, Simon. He's a dachshund. He's like 17 years old. He's really, oh yes, hello, hello.
[15.05s -> 18.81s]  He can go down. But, uh, thank you guys so much. I got a couple of things in this video you guys
[18.81s -> 26.38s]  gonna like. I've got a setup video and I have a crazy kind of cooking show. But hopefully you
[26.38s -> 34.02s]  guys enjoy it. I really do appreciate the 4,000. Let's keep rolling, everybody. All right, so this
[34.02s -> 39.64s]  is my desk. I'll give you like a nice wide shot of the desk. So there's the desk, there's the monitor,
[39.64s -> 45.64s]  there's my chair. The desk is kind of messy, so I apologize. I didn't really have time to clean it
[45.64s -> 52.20s]  up before I made this video. But anyways, the computer is under the desk. It's lit, it's all
[52.20s -> 58.52s]  lit up blue and stuff, nice and cool. So that is the computer. The specs on this thing, it is a
[58.52s -> 64.12s]  custom-built Digital Storm PC. Highly recommend Digital Storm. If you guys don't know what Digital
[64.12s -> 72.01s]  Storm is, go find out. They're awesome. So it is an Intel i7-950 and it's overclocked to 3.6
[72.01s -> 82.95s]  gigahertz. It has 6 gigs of RAM at 1600 megahertz. It is a, oh, it has a Nvidia GTX 470, the super
[82.95s -> 92.58s]  clocked EVGA edition. Shibby will like that. And it also has a one terabyte, I believe, one terabyte
[92.58s -> 99.27s]  32 MB cache hard drive. I think it's a Western Digital, I think. Here's the monitor. It is a
[99.27s -> 108.57s]  27 inch monitor made by HP, the HP 2710M. It's a very, very nice monitor, nice and glossy, nice
[108.57s -> 114.20s]  finish. I really enjoy it. So that's kind of my computer setup. Oh, I also, here's my external
[114.20s -> 120.84s]  hard drive right there. I have it plugged in with eSATA. I don't have it plugged in with a USB
[120.84s -> 126.71s]  because eSATA is faster and more efficient. And yeah, that's pretty much my computer setup.
[126.71s -> 132.86s]  Hope you guys enjoy that. And now let's make some breakfast. All right. So we're here in the kitchen.
[132.86s -> 137.98s]  I'm going to cook you guys an American classic. This is the two eggs, two pieces of bacon,
[137.98s -> 141.98s]  two pieces of toast. Cause a lot of guys ask me, they say, Jerma, how do you stay so healthy?
[141.98s -> 146.86s]  How do you stay so physically fit? Like how, what can I do to get healthy? Besides exercise and
[146.86s -> 150.70s]  besides obviously keeping a good diet, you want a good breakfast. Now let's start out by talking
[150.70s -> 154.94s]  about the bacon. Bacon, you want premium cut. You don't want any of the gross, bad stuff. You
[154.94s -> 162.60s]  want the good stuff. Two eggs, two pieces of toast. And we're going to start. There's only one egg in
[162.60s -> 166.84s]  here. All right. Let's just go to the store real quick. Yeah. I'll go. Just, uh, it's, uh, the
[166.84s -> 176.58s]  supermarket's open, right? Yep. Did someone ask for an egg? Oh, it's the egg. Oh, all right. Come on
[176.58s -> 182.17s]  in, bro. Let's, let's do this. This is, uh, this is the egg. For those of you that don't know,
[182.17s -> 185.53s]  this is the egg. He's a really good friend of mine. He's been here for a long time.
[186.09s -> 190.97s]  Um, he had a crazy accident at some point in his life. I don't know when it was, but he, uh,
[190.97s -> 195.53s]  he turned into this and, uh, I mean, I don't, I don't know why I'm introducing you. You could
[195.53s -> 205.86s]  potentially do this yourself, but, uh, the egg. Um, I'm trying to do a healthy, like American
[208.71s -> 215.06s]  iPad. I kinda, I kinda only wanted to be honest. I wanted just like a few eggs. Like I only wanted
[215.06s -> 224.04s]  like two eggs. You can never have too many eggs. Um, you gotta tell me you're the egg expert. So
[224.04s -> 228.04s]  you gotta tell me if this is true. Is it true that the egg yolk is like the unhealthy part?
[228.04s -> 235.18s]  Don't you really want to cook like the egg whites and... In the military radium, we only cook
[235.18s -> 251.94s]  hybrid goat and chicken egg. Okay. So what does that have to do with anything? This is not how
[251.94s -> 256.82s]  you cook eggs. I don't know where you, where you figured this was a good idea. Whoever told you
[256.82s -> 261.93s]  this was a good idea was completely wrong. Everybody, everyone thinks this is funny. What
[261.93s -> 266.09s]  are you, what are you doing? So I, I mean, I, I at least want to add a little bit of bacon because
[266.09s -> 276.26s]  if bacon is... Not only egg. All right. The egg has, uh, has officially left us. Uh, I don't know
[276.26s -> 281.06s]  where he went. He just took off. He like stormed out of the kitchen. I don't understand, but I'm
[281.06s -> 286.90s]  going to try and fix this breakfast because this is an atrocity. Thank you, egg. You, uh, thanks
[286.90s -> 292.98s]  for bringing me extra eggs. I appreciate it, but you, um, obviously have a few problems in your life
[292.98s -> 298.10s]  you need to deal with. And that's something that you can figure out on your own. Okay. So it has
[298.10s -> 304.42s]  been a painfully long time since the egg has left and to be completely honest, I'm getting kind of
[304.42s -> 319.14s]  concerned. So, um, did you hear that? That is the shower. That is the shower. Egg. Egg. Shh. I knew,
[319.14s -> 321.86s]  I knew this was going to happen, dude. Watch out. Watch out. Get out of the way. Watch out.
[322.58s -> 343.40s]  You all right, egg? It's time for you to go home. Okay. You gotta, you gotta go home.
[344.04s -> 348.07s]  See you later, egg. When you're out of the shower, get out of here. Okay. Leave the house.
[351.94s -> 356.98s]  So thank you everybody for 4,000 subscribers. You guys are awesome. I hope you guys enjoyed this
[356.98s -> 362.58s]  little skit we put together for you guys. And, uh, yeah. Thank you for 4,000. See you guys next time.
[362.58s -> 386.28s]  Take care, everybody.
