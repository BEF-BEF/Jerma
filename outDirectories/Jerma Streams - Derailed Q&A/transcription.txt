[219.51s -> 222.58s]  We want to apologize
[222.90s -> 235.93s]  Tomorrow I can't even fix it. It refuses to not be a mustache. I'm just I'm buzzeted. I'm buzzing it
[236.45s -> 244.16s]  It has to be wet for it to not be mustache hair. I asked me anything. Let's go. Let's do it
[244.16s -> 246.08s]  Ask me they'll even in the right category
[246.08s -> 258.37s]  No, all right. Let's go
[264.65s -> 266.65s]  It's your favorite color teal
[266.69s -> 269.18s]  teal a
[269.18s -> 271.18s]  large is your
[273.14s -> 274.94s]  Index finger, I don't know
[274.94s -> 280.67s]  Two and a half inches when you play super monkey ball very soon on the Nintendo GameCube
[281.47s -> 294.51s]  When you're gonna get sponsored by Chuck E Cheese, it's not gonna happen. You'd like their establishment though. What's my ones that I can answer, please?
[295.15s -> 308.96s]  Are you gonna play metal gear? Uh, maybe that's the last time you peed your pants an hour ago
[309.08s -> 313.24s]  When are you gonna do birdwatching?
[315.30s -> 326.88s]  That's a good question. I have no idea. I have absolutely no idea. I want to do the birdwatching stream, but I want it to be
[327.56s -> 331.22s]  Good. All right. Here's my fear about the birdwatching stream
[331.22s -> 335.14s]  I'm out there and I got binoculars and you guys got binoculars. You guys have your own binoculars for chat
[335.58s -> 339.03s]  So you can see too, you know, so I can like put you in the right spot
[339.03s -> 344.27s]  I want there to be a camera that's binoculars in the camera so I can when I look at it
[344.27s -> 349.45s]  You'll see it too. But the problem with that is what if no birds show up?
[349.77s -> 352.93s]  And it's just me sitting it under like a tree
[353.47s -> 362.12s]  Like four or five hours. Did I grow a unibrow? No, I think it's just the
[362.64s -> 369.18s]  Thanks. Just did I I try I usually Kim gets in there and she and she plucks it for me
[369.70s -> 381.33s]  Is it there doesn't look like it? Maybe it's like the bitrate. It's been a while though
[381.77s -> 389.27s]  No, it feels pretty bare in there. Maybe like right here. It's a little thick
[389.75s -> 391.75s]  It could use it. It could use a little cleaning
[392.23s -> 394.91s]  You're a mess
[394.91s -> 410.33s]  Am I actually that there's a car? Okay. Hold on. Here's the thing if when I go like this, am I?
[410.81s -> 414.03s]  One or two frames in there make it look like shit
[414.47s -> 422.56s]  That's the thing you could pull even if I look at you like this and I'm talking like very normally and I look fairly
[422.56s -> 424.56s]  normal one of these
[425.08s -> 428.12s]  Frames is gonna look wicked
[429.32s -> 437.07s]  And which one is it? I don't know. Did somebody do it? Let's let's do I want to I want to do this theory
[437.63s -> 443.81s]  Okay, I'm gonna say a sentence and I want somebody to just take a screenshot of me in the middle of talking and I guarantee
[443.81s -> 448.03s]  You my eyes are going this way. My nose is like going like this. My mouth is like this
[448.61s -> 453.82s]  They ready. Hey, welcome to the channel. My name is German on eight five

[494.49s -> 500.53s]  I can't click that I can't I'm not showing that I'm not showing that I'm not gonna show it not showing it
[516.23s -> 524.63s]  Why did you make this okay this somebody's got one
[527.13s -> 538.38s]  I'm not I'm not showing that it's okay. Look it look at how fucked up I look
[538.82s -> 541.46s]  This is just a random frame
[541.46s -> 544.86s]  Let's see
[544.86s -> 551.49s]  I want to see if I can match how I look in these weird screenshots that you take in the middle of me talking
[552.05s -> 559.73s]  Doesn't like something looks strange. Something looks off
[560.25s -> 574.33s]  Normal my eyes look too big
[574.49s -> 583.24s]  All of a sudden the one on the right just goes man just jumps at the screen. Oh, that'd be awesome
[583.76s -> 598.33s]  It's the real one. Yeah, perfect. So I've here we go. I need to show you guys this because this is so important
[598.81s -> 601.05s]  when people
[601.05s -> 604.71s]  Show a funny picture that I did look at how funny and weird he looks
[605.39s -> 608.15s]  Look at this like crazy streamer. He's crazed
[608.59s -> 617.25s]  No, I think you just take a frame from in the middle of a normal sentence and I look I look insane
[617.69s -> 630.82s]  Gray hair. I don't have gray. It's the light above there. I'm cheese to meet you. No, I don't
[631.38s -> 650.06s]  Yeah, here's another one. This one's the worst. This is awful this guy. I used to do this
[650.06s -> 652.06s]  I used to do this shit for a living
[652.30s -> 660.66s]  This is every single photo of people at the wedding that are not the bride or the groom that are in focus
[660.94s -> 663.62s]  This is every single other image
[664.14s -> 677.58s]  Whoever is not directly in focus. You're this guy and you might just be eating he made money from this
[678.30s -> 681.60s]  Yes, I did. I did I did wedding shit
[682.22s -> 687.78s]  Because that was the job that I could do I knew how to edit I knew how to film
[687.78s -> 695.55s]  I I knew how to do these things. So I what can I do? I'm gonna make some cash. That's not new lore
[695.55s -> 697.55s]  I've yes, that's been known since like
[697.91s -> 698.95s]  2012
[698.95s -> 709.85s]  Chuck left. It's okay. I feel like this is not real
[710.45s -> 719.92s]  Is okay. Here's that let's play a game. Is this a real image or not? I don't think this one is I do not believe
[719.92s -> 726.64s]  This is a real screenshot from the string. No, it's not you can tell look at the nose
[727.00s -> 733.60s]  It's not real because look at the nose and look yeah, this is that this is not real. Sorry and incorrect
[736.40s -> 756.15s]  Rotate not real you can tell by the tip of the nose and you can tell by the eyes
[756.67s -> 760.73s]  Not a real image. My eyes are too. The eyes are too close together in this one
[761.21s -> 767.00s]  Hey
[767.00s -> 778.54s]  Incorrect. I'm going up next on is this a real screenshot from the stream? This one is okay
[778.72s -> 782.56s]  I'm gonna my vote on this one is is yes
[782.96s -> 788.61s]  This is a yes from me. I think I think I believe this is probably a real image
[789.09s -> 799.76s]  Maybe not. Yeah, it's really look at you. See that. He's a space here
[799.92s -> 813.31s]  Okay, they were smart enough if they doctored it to put that in your dinosaur. I don't know though
[813.31s -> 815.31s]  This looks a little fat down here
[815.55s -> 817.55s]  like right here this looks I
[818.79s -> 829.08s]  I don't know. I don't think that's real. Maybe it's not I'm gonna vote real though. I feel like this is real
[829.52s -> 846.16s]  It's real. Okay, got it. Nice Raptor tooth. Hey. Hey, let's see your teeth. This one's also real
[846.56s -> 867.10s]  Let's see, it's also real. Yeah, that's a real image. What else we got?
[867.82s -> 872.34s]  Let's see this one this one. I I you know, I'm not I'm actually not sure about this one
[872.34s -> 874.94s]  Is this one day is this one a real image or not? Let's see. I wonder um
[875.90s -> 882.88s]  well
[882.88s -> 889.98s]  Mmm, it's hard to tell cuz like down here is the way that it seems pretty similar
[890.62s -> 900.81s]  Yeah, it's real. I think this one's probably real pretty close
[901.43s -> 903.23s]  This one's tough though. I don't know
[903.23s -> 913.65s]  The left one's the fake one I know this is real
[915.01s -> 917.01s]  You know how I know this is real I
[917.05s -> 923.72s]  Can tell you immediately because this is the exact face that I make in that germ of log thumbnail
[924.22s -> 930.43s]  Where I'm going like that. It's the same exact face. Somebody want to get it because it's we can verify the image
[930.43s -> 934.92s]  It's like handwriting like the way that your mouth moves when you talk is
[935.48s -> 943.77s]  Your handwriting that you it's handwriting like you can be identified. That's not a that's not a soy
[943.95s -> 946.51s]  Face, okay, that's me talking
[947.03s -> 954.54s]  So when I just said the a in talking talking go ahead ready when I say the a and talking

[1002.78s -> 1027.38s]  It's this one. Give me the real one, please
[1027.82s -> 1049.54s]  People that are coming in and they said somebody just said this is so stupid
[1049.54s -> 1053.66s]  Why can't we to watch the VOD you have no idea what happened during the stream?
[1053.66s -> 1056.94s]  Could you like if you explain this to somebody would do you think they would even believe you? I
[1057.82s -> 1074.05s]  Don't I don't think I would believe somebody if they said this that's not even me. You're not even linking me pictures of me
[1076.54s -> 1081.46s]  I'm gonna get this off my computer
[1081.46s -> 1084.50s]  I gotta get this image off my fucking computer and off my hard drive
[1084.90s -> 1091.46s]  And then I have to fucking then I have to get a new hard drive, okay
[1091.46s -> 1102.54s]  Where is this picture? What's wrong with this one? Wasn't on fucking purpose. I swear to God. I swear to God. I swear to God
[1106.61s -> 1111.47s]  Why are you doing this?
[1112.11s -> 1134.79s]  What file is it? This is real, of course
[1135.43s -> 1139.21s]  I'm still being hosted
[1140.09s -> 1142.55s]  Shit. Oh
[1142.55s -> 1145.47s]  No, no, no, we have to abort immediately
[1146.03s -> 1153.00s]  This is an immediate this is an immediate abort scenario if I'm being hosted still
[1153.52s -> 1176.02s]  Okay, this one's like funny, but this is not even this is not even the same stream. This is a different stream
[1176.34s -> 1186.87s]  This is a different. This is a different place
[1187.45s -> 1204.53s]  Is this a pog? No, this is not a pog. I know there's noise coming off of this though
[1204.97s -> 1209.06s]  You want to know the noise coming off of this? This is the sound that this is making
[1209.06s -> 1213.93s]  Oh
[1216.05s -> 1233.78s]  That's what that emotion is that's not going like like oh no, no, that's very very energetic
[1234.30s -> 1256.96s]  Kind of energy behind it. All right, what else you got? This is too big. Oh Chuck E Cheese is offline
[1258.80s -> 1267.76s]  That's just a before-and-after photo
[1268.56s -> 1273.82s]  Alright, that's just that's one of those like this is what happens when you do drugs for a long time
[1274.30s -> 1283.46s]  The only thing it's missing is it's missing like four or five other pictures
[1283.98s -> 1304.46s]  That end up here. Maybe you shouldn't watch this stream. What else you got? I will add any more questions. Anybody got any questions?
[1305.18s -> 1308.28s]  Anybody have anything any questions to ask? Oh

[1324.85s -> 1328.97s]  No, no more of that two three month active bullshit. It's just not gonna work
[1328.97s -> 1332.93s]  I wasn't around for like months so I cannot expect people to sub through my absence
[1333.21s -> 1339.91s]  So September 13th put it on your calendar at 3 p.m. Pacific. Why is it happening so much later now?
[1339.91s -> 1350.56s]  I'm noticing the unibrow now. I'm noticing it. I see what you mean, but it's not there
[1352.50s -> 1355.50s]  It's really not there though. It's like something to do with how this shadow is gone
[1357.18s -> 1360.26s]  What the fuck happened
[1360.62s -> 1365.83s]  Okay cheese did something what happened we're talking about

[1370.57s -> 1377.11s]  Alright, so it's not gonna be what you expect this time. It's gonna be a lot different. It's gonna be a
[1378.13s -> 1383.01s]  100% reimagined game. It's not gonna be just shoot arrows at him until he fucking gets drunk and
[1383.53s -> 1384.57s]  swears
[1384.57s -> 1387.96s]  No, he's blitzed

[1419.14s -> 1421.46s]  So I was in the bathroom for a really long time yesterday
[1421.90s -> 1426.04s]  And I was just hanging out in there just like I was on the phone and like after you go
[1426.04s -> 1430.51s]  I don't know. I do this all the time like after I'm done using the bathroom
[1431.48s -> 1436.91s]  I just hang out in there even when I'm done like clean. We're talking clean and done completely

[1446.46s -> 1449.06s]  so I get out of the bathroom, I've been in there for about 30 minutes and
[1449.90s -> 1454.34s]  Kim is laughing her ass off at me. She's just cracking up. I'm like, what is so funny. What are you doing?
[1454.34s -> 1456.70s]  And she just she was dying laughing. I could not get it out of her
[1456.70s -> 1461.94s]  I'm just like what why are you laughing and she's like just wait, wait, wait, and she took her
[1461.94s -> 1466.34s]  She's like, please turn around and she took a photo. By the way, I'm just I'm in my underwear, right?
[1466.54s -> 1468.54s]  she took a photo and
[1468.82s -> 1475.69s]  The photo is of my backside. There is a toilet seat. That is a perfect toilet seat
[1476.25s -> 1480.11s]  Line red under my like on my legs
[1480.59s -> 1492.70s]  It's a big perfect toilet seat that's indented into my legs and I was really it was fucked
[1492.70s -> 1501.54s]  It was so stupid. It was funny though. That's why my back is fucked up
[1502.02s -> 1503.54s]  No, it's not
[1503.54s -> 1507.31s]  It has a toilet scar
[1507.91s -> 1516.20s]  Okay, you know how people when they play games a lot they get this like the little redness here with the mouse on the keyboard
[1516.20s -> 1522.34s]  I guarantee you I have a red ass. I guarantee it. I guarantee it

[1544.94s -> 1549.84s]  Just gonna have to take my word for it. I get this off the fucking screen
[1549.84s -> 1564.54s]  I don't want you to see the shelf because it was spoilers from the cam off
[1565.38s -> 1568.30s]  But when this cam turns off the streams turning off this this got destroyed
[1569.43s -> 1572.27s]  Started off playing a game Chuck E Cheese became my new best friend
[1573.58s -> 1576.90s]  This has been weird, but I'm cool. It's fun
[1577.42s -> 1589.07s]  Draw it, but he hates you now. You missed a Chuck E Cheese comment
[1625.06s -> 1629.76s]  Okay

[1638.74s -> 1644.67s]  Back the last time we did it, which is like four months ago. Now. This is gonna be completely different. It was
[1645.19s -> 1652.27s]  Kind of haphazardly organized. It wasn't a good set up. The servers got hammered this time this time
[1653.11s -> 1655.99s]  It's gonna be completely different. We're gonna have like a ton
[1655.99s -> 1659.07s]  There's gonna be like seven or eight servers linked together to make this happen
[1659.55s -> 1665.66s]  It's gonna be people you don't have to be subbed for more than two or three months. Just active subscription. That's it
[1666.18s -> 1671.22s]  There's gonna be a period about a three or four days before the stream happens
[1671.54s -> 1676.50s]  Well, we're gonna start to try to bring in like white list people and get them white listed
[1676.50s -> 1680.26s]  So we don't have the server get dumped with thousands of connections at the exact same time
[1680.66s -> 1687.65s]  This is what German plans when he's on the toilet. Yeah, no it is. You're right. This is you have that exactly, right?
[1689.21s -> 1690.25s]  Explain FTK
[1690.25s -> 1695.09s]  Well, it was called fuck the king and the goal was I was gonna get as many people as I possibly could again
[1695.09s -> 1698.31s]  Do a minecraft server with the goal is just whoever could just try to kill me
[1698.31s -> 1701.17s]  I had god armor on and they were all children
[1701.17s -> 1705.01s]  They were all babies and they would they would have tried to kill me like three or four hundred of them
[1705.45s -> 1707.45s]  But then it did that didn't happen
[1707.57s -> 1709.57s]  I don't have dying like three times
[1710.69s -> 1712.69s]  the server went down like ten times and
[1713.87s -> 1716.91s]  Um, that's all I remember I
[1717.59s -> 1723.23s]  Remember walking around singing and there's like just 60 people standing around me and just looking at me
[1724.66s -> 1731.74s]  It's changed. This is a full three to five hour experience. It's it's a full game. This is a game
[1732.10s -> 1734.26s]  This is not just like a okay. We're in
[1735.54s -> 1744.44s]  Fucking just walk over there and just try to catch him. I guess no, there's a full game. It's September 13th at 3 p.m
[1744.88s -> 1750.52s]  Pacific the server is also gonna stay up by the way
[1750.52s -> 1754.58s]  So when this is all done the server stays up for at least a month
[1755.06s -> 1763.87s]  So people can play it that didn't get to play in the server. That's really important. I will I will crush it
[1764.35s -> 1767.46s]  Please don't
[1767.46s -> 1770.81s]  Arm of death is back, but it's changed a little bit
[1770.81s -> 1775.93s]  You don't get banned from the server you get kicked back to one of these hub cities that they're gonna have
[1776.09s -> 1778.97s]  They're gonna have multiple servers that I have gonna have just be hub
[1779.21s -> 1781.91s]  Places for you to requeue to get back into the game
[1781.91s -> 1784.53s]  So you're not banned but you drop to the back of the queue
[1784.89s -> 1789.04s]  We want to try to cycle in as many people as possible and no gosh darn it
[1789.04s -> 1794.27s]  Let me tell you there's gonna be quite a few people being cycled out this y'all ain't gonna live
[1794.27s -> 1797.95s]  I can I just I can assure you that so like those you that are like, yeah
[1797.95s -> 1811.06s]  I'm gonna fucking live the whole time. I hope so. Good luck. Good luck. Make the germa is tiny sign again
[1811.06s -> 1818.92s]  I just like that person in the back of the queue. You're going to germa hell
[1819.12s -> 1821.12s]  It is kind of like a purgatory thing
[1821.72s -> 1826.28s]  Because you don't get booted out of the client or anything or out of the server you go back to one of the other
[1827.12s -> 1833.48s]  Queue servers. So how do you get in the queue? You just connect you just connect and
[1833.92s -> 1836.28s]  Then you get to you're gonna be able to you're gonna do a little thing
[1836.28s -> 1843.02s]  There's gonna be a slash like authenticate thing where it just checks to see if you're a sub and apparently it works very very well
[1843.54s -> 1845.06s]  They've been testing it for a little while
[1845.06s -> 1851.71s]  All it does is just is this person's subs to germa 985 actively right now. The answer is yes
[1851.91s -> 1855.55s]  And you can go in if the answer is no if hey, hold on if the answer is no
[1856.19s -> 1859.32s]  You still hang out this hub server. You that's shut
[1859.80s -> 1864.88s]  Speaking is difficult when you do it for a long time in a row. That's been about four hours of speaking in a row
[1865.88s -> 1873.01s]  And you'll die. No, you can hang out in the hub city. You don't you can be in the hub cities
[1873.77s -> 1876.37s]  You just can't join the FTK game
[1876.93s -> 1882.60s]  There are hub worlds people computer play can queue to play
[1882.60s -> 1887.20s]  I actually don't know exactly how the hub world like the queue world is going to work
[1887.60s -> 1891.28s]  but I'll obviously over the next three or four days, I'll get some more details on it and
[1892.79s -> 1895.55s]  Like not even like three or four days before the stream happens
[1895.55s -> 1897.23s]  There's gonna be a lot of testing on this as well
[1897.23s -> 1901.67s]  And I'll be in the discord asking all kinds of questions for people if they want to try to jump in and help
[1901.99s -> 1904.11s]  So that's a curse length where?
[1904.71s -> 1924.76s]  I thought that was real. I was like, holy shit. When did I show that much like underwear on stream?
[1925.48s -> 1928.72s]  I've never shown underwear like that on stream. I
[1929.48s -> 1933.09s]  Did ruin a pair of capes underwear though
[1933.09s -> 1937.21s]  I just put them on cuz I was freaking out and they just didn't fit right and I just ripped the room
[1937.89s -> 1944.31s]  Yeah, I didn't mean to wear them. I was I have black underwear. She has black underwear
[1944.59s -> 1947.11s]  This is a really fucking hard thing to explain
[1947.11s -> 1951.49s]  This is a really weird thing to be hosted by a family restaurant that serves pizza and as arcade games
[1952.07s -> 1958.41s]  I'm talking about tearing through my girls like friends underwear. Why do I put it on?
[1958.85s -> 1964.70s]  I'm not sure like anybody should be here right now, you know
[1964.82s -> 1967.70s]  Do you think that I don't think anyone should be watching this
[1968.22s -> 1971.16s]  We're gonna put like a family restaurant
[1971.96s -> 1982.64s]  Do a podcast. What do you want me to talk about? I'll do it right now
[1983.00s -> 1998.74s]  Give me a talk. Give me a topic and I'll talk about it runescape pretty cool. You can hey, how about that latest runescape update?
[1999.26s -> 2009.72s]  2.4 point to talk about the stock market. No, we don't talk about the stock market anymore
[2010.24s -> 2016.39s]  Thought after Beyond Meat, I don't talk about the stock market anymore since Beyond Meat
[2016.87s -> 2027.92s]  I got burned on Beyond Meat real bad. Yeah. Yeah, I was like, there's no way this is like a fucking $300 a share company
[2027.92s -> 2031.32s]  This is like more the way this was like more than Apple. I was like this is coming fucking way down
[2031.80s -> 2034.12s]  Like there's no way this is it's a fucking it's I did look they're good
[2034.12s -> 2037.92s]  I like them, but it's like as expensive as like Apple
[2038.24s -> 2043.60s]  I was like this no way you win some you fucking lose some you lose most of them
[2043.60s -> 2046.16s]  You lose almost all of them. You lose almost all except for maybe one
[2048.32s -> 2050.32s]  while doing that, okay, so
[2050.96s -> 2054.81s]  How much did you lose? Not enough to be upset about
[2055.45s -> 2060.89s]  enough to be irritated
[2061.85s -> 2069.68s]  What modulator voice modulation do I use well, it is a go XLR and it actually works pretty well
[2070.08s -> 2074.60s]  It seems to be very cool. It's pretty easy to use
[2076.96s -> 2082.34s]  Is you just plug in your mic I'll get into your computer and it's a compressor it does everything for you
[2082.34s -> 2087.06s]  I don't want to have a a compressor a noise gate a
[2087.62s -> 2090.84s]  End up like it's like an airplane up here. It's really really easy
[2091.48s -> 2095.42s]  Is that an ad no, I don't do but it works
[2095.98s -> 2104.02s]  What am I gonna be a VTuber? I'm not a VTuber. There's somebody else that might become a VTuber eventually, but I'm not them
[2104.66s -> 2114.61s]  Yeah, give me the image. When's the rumble the rumble is gonna be we're gonna be 2020
[2115.43s -> 2117.43s]  rumble will be on
[2117.83s -> 2125.97s]  January 1st, but December 31st. I'm gonna count down again like we did last time and in between
[2126.97s -> 2131.01s]  Matches at the rumble. We're gonna do a few categories for the worst and best of the year
[2131.45s -> 2135.72s]  I'm gonna do kind of a combo stream on New Year's Eve this year. That's right
[2136.94s -> 2139.46s]  combo German rumble Awards stream
[2140.87s -> 2145.68s]  countdown New Year and I figured we could do it like that because as
[2146.16s -> 2149.16s]  You all know I kind of disappeared for like two and a half months
[2149.84s -> 2154.76s]  So almost a full quarter of the year was kind of removed from this channel
[2155.32s -> 2166.09s]  So, I think we're gonna just kind of put it into the rumble I mean we're gonna do halo reach stream part two
[2170.08s -> 2174.07s]  I'm not ever doing that again. Make the nominees fight for the award
[2175.13s -> 2187.53s]  That's gonna happen at least once that will happen. I promise it'll happen at least one time at least once is
[2192.44s -> 2196.77s]  What that's gonna be a long stream? No, I don't think it will
[2197.29s -> 2201.59s]  Just think about it. All the rumble streams are all less than three hours long
[2202.27s -> 2207.63s]  It's just we watch it we do it I make it and we enjoy it and that's it and it's like two to four hours
[2207.63s -> 2209.63s]  It's not usually more than three hours
[2209.87s -> 2215.45s]  So you put some categories in there you have like 10 15 plus categories being add another hour or two to the stream
[2215.45s -> 2217.45s]  It's a four or five six hour stream. It's perfect
[2227.77s -> 2233.47s]  Okay, if you go to Chuck E Cheese, I think they give you one of these so this doesn't mean anything to me
[2236.89s -> 2239.07s]  You can actually get one of these
[2239.31s -> 2249.50s]  And I mean like that this is not that this photo I mean, that's really great
[2249.90s -> 2255.58s]  But this I feel like this is he writes BFF on every single selfie that people take with them
[2255.86s -> 2258.66s]  How do I know that I'm special? How do I know I'm his real BFF?
[2258.66s -> 2268.86s]  How's that? How am I supposed to know that he probably writes that on all of them, but if you turn it over
[2269.62s -> 2281.45s]  There's a note on it. You don't do that for everybody. See what it says on the back
[2281.69s -> 2290.51s]  that's the thing where you're walking towards somebody that's in the same fucking lane as you and
[2291.07s -> 2295.07s]  Like you've dealt you both move at the exact same time like football players trying to avoid each other
[2295.07s -> 2297.07s]  I just did that and I'm trying to
[2298.30s -> 2308.78s]  This what does it say on the back? I think my hands too small
[2309.32s -> 2356.44s]  God damn it. Hold on. I want to do this is a color corrector. What the fuck is this?
[2357.32s -> 2369.88s]  This is fucked up. Sorry. My OBS is fucked up. Why is it not showing me that? I can't like the scroll is so weird
[2369.88s -> 2377.53s]  Why is it doing this? I was gonna make myself black and white forget it. It says it says we're best friends. Forget it
[2377.53s -> 2387.00s]  I can't I thought I was gonna do something funny. Why this is annoying me. Why I wish I could show this
[2387.56s -> 2389.75s]  Now this whole thing is fucked up
[2389.75s -> 2401.02s]  What the fuck just brought like a bunch of little ants in my computer to do all this work for me that like that's behind
[2401.02s -> 2401.46s]  The scene stuff
[2401.46s -> 2406.38s]  I mean don't you wish I could just about have a computer with like an ants in it that could like they had lived like a
[2406.38s -> 2408.38s]  Really comfortable life in there and they can like control everything
[2409.14s -> 2427.24s]  And everything's messed up now. I don't know what's I don't know how to fix this. I
[2428.98s -> 2437.13s]  Opened up the fucking menu and now my camera just went down like ten points in quality
[2437.57s -> 2465.86s]  What is happening? Harold Albertson 9a5 just gave 20 community subs. I fucking hate this not you giving those subs this
[2466.10s -> 2485.96s]  Okay. Now this is the final picture. I have to like redo this. I
[2486.60s -> 2495.55s]  Don't know how this even happened. I touched the gamma once and my in cut my computer exploded
[2495.71s -> 2498.71s]  Don't look at those fucking spoilers back there. Get out of here. I
[2499.35s -> 2516.01s]  See you freaking like what's over there? What games that what's the next game? I don't even think about it. What happened to the camera?
[2525.30s -> 2558.00s]  Where did I go? Where am I? Hold on. What? Oh, I should the red I changed the resolution. I brought everything's broken
[2558.00s -> 2561.12s]  I actually broke it. I don't know what I did. I have no idea what's going on
[2561.84s -> 2593.26s]  Where is this picture? You guys can't see it, but it looks even worse. I don't understand
[2593.98s -> 2595.98s]  Okay, let me change this
[2596.02s -> 2613.43s]  All right up the stream is over the stream ended 30 minutes ago. I don't know what's going on now
[2613.43s -> 2640.83s]  I've lost it. It's I've lost control of the stream home again. Well, I'm working backwards. Hold on
[2654.57s -> 2658.43s]  This is just every FMV video clip on the Sega CD
[2665.02s -> 2679.26s]  HD Jerma add scanlines to it. It's been for I I'm gonna go I'm gonna go I got nothing else planned
[2679.78s -> 2687.08s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow
[2687.16s -> 2698.19s]  Tomorrow we're gonna it was it was Chuck E Cheese man Chuck E Cheese. It's just I feel like I'm in a fucking dream
[2704.34s -> 2709.30s]  Can we nominate best one guy moment? But when Chuck E Cheese derailed the whole stream?
[2711.27s -> 2724.20s]  That's my nomination. All right. I I don't want to hurt anybody's eyes
[2724.92s -> 2731.78s]  Yeah, I'm gonna call that. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. It's fast credits. Holy shit
[2731.78s -> 2739.76s]  How many people subscribe today of a lot of very large amount of people actually?
[2740.28s -> 2757.08s]  This is almost a thousand people. Oh, yeah. Why did I do 50 community subs?
[2757.56s -> 2761.79s]  This one's just lost in my brain
[2762.43s -> 2771.45s]  fell right right right
[2771.69s -> 2781.13s]  Alright, so what are we doing tomorrow? What's the deal tomorrow? Saturday is the DLC part two
[2781.13s -> 2797.46s]  I mean we could do more of that game the ship one if not, then
[2798.14s -> 2812.69s]  We've got pick custom robo. I got custom robo. I got a bunch of Xbox stuff saw too
[2813.17s -> 2817.07s]  We you know what we might be able to do soft
[2817.31s -> 2823.08s]  Let me let me see if because I have saw to know how much time and wouldn't remember how much time was left in
[2823.08s -> 2836.61s]  Saw one like an hour, right? It was not ten hours left. There was probably maybe an hour in the first one 45 minutes
[2836.61s -> 2842.69s]  Yeah, I'll think about it. We're either gonna finish saw one and move on to saw two tomorrow or
[2843.57s -> 2846.05s]  I'm gonna play custom robo or
[2848.27s -> 2863.84s]  Mystery PC game anything about that. Oh that a lot of fun though. This was fun got a little weird, but it was fun
[2864.28s -> 2867.41s]  Thanks for watching as always guys
[2867.57s -> 2870.14s]  again
[2870.14s -> 2872.14s]  September 13th mark it on your calendar
[2872.38s -> 2878.88s]  3 p.m. If you're an active sub you can play in the FTK server. It's gonna get streamed
[2879.40s -> 2892.86s]  It's gonna be all kinds of fun. I am looking forward to it. No more euro streams. This is a euro stream. Yeah, it is
[2893.54s -> 2905.27s]  Started it like around noon, right Pacific. That's pretty euro friendly, isn't it?
[2905.83s -> 2916.26s]  Where's the radioactive skeleton pick I will show that the minute that I actually have it to a raid raid raid raid
[2916.26s -> 2918.18s]  All right, who do you want to raid?
[2918.18s -> 2926.46s]  We rating who's available right now. Chuck E. Cheese Chuck E. Cheese is offline
[2926.46s -> 2937.48s]  I don't think Chuck E. Cheese is streaming right now. Do it. Anyway a
[2939.46s -> 2956.56s]  Raided offline chat. I've seen a lot of Limmy Limmy Limmy Limmy. Who else we got. He's a cool dude
[2956.92s -> 2976.70s]  Tomato tomato tomatoes a cool dude, too. Yeah, that's too. All right. I I don't know. I don't know
[2977.30s -> 2983.18s]  What in half? All right half of you go half of you go to tomato half of you go to Limmy
[2983.18s -> 2990.87s]  How's that sound lame? Don't split us up. All right
[2991.51s -> 3003.38s]  That's not how you do it. Are you do it? You do it. All right number generator 1 to 2. Here we go
[3003.54s -> 3005.54s]  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
[3005.98s -> 3016.42s]  All right, we're gonna let me it was fucking awesome too though. Go watch him too
[3016.98s -> 3030.16s]  And go watch all these people they're all fucking fantastic. I wish you could split the raid. Wouldn't that be cool?
[3030.80s -> 3034.89s]  If we could like just like spread out a bunch of like it's for a bunch of different places
[3034.89s -> 3041.82s]  That would be kind of fun. Is that like too dumb of an idea? Is that like a stupid fucking idea?
[3041.82s -> 3053.70s]  I go tell go say hello to Limmy. That's a stupid idea. I wish Chuck E. Cheese is alive right now
[3053.70s -> 3063.30s]  We would just dump on him. All right, the next time Chuck E. Cheese is live
[3063.78s -> 3070.53s]  I want to make sure I want to dump a raid on Chuck E. Cheese. I'm starting that I'm going for it
[3070.97s -> 3090.34s]  Keep an eye out. All right. I'll see you tomorrow
[3090.82s -> 3100.44s]  Is this the second time I've rated Limmy, right?
[3103.48s -> 3107.00s]  Has he does he like look back and go like who the fuck is this guy?
[3108.54s -> 3111.46s]  Like let me we're coming to say hi. I
[3115.30s -> 3119.78s]  Don't know if he doesn't know me at all. It's just like we're arriving Limmy
[3120.70s -> 3123.04s]  Okay. Okay. Hi guys. What's up?
[3123.68s -> 3135.46s]  That's it Vinny. No, I said Limmy didn't I?
[3135.98s -> 3140.38s]  All right. See you guys later. See you tomorrow
[3141.14s -> 3144.57s]  Around the same time. Goodbye. Good night. Take care
