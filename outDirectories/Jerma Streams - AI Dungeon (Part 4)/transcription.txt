[1.66s -> 10.66s]  You know something's funny that I've only really started to notice very very recently is before
[10.66s -> 16.17s]  stream starts I'm just you know I'm throwing some water in my face and maybe I brush my teeth I'm
[16.17s -> 25.34s]  taking Otto outside but when it strikes that exact moment of let's say 11 o'clock right I'm looking
[25.34s -> 31.90s]  outside and the fucking birds are chirping my dog is just what's this what's that over there
[32.62s -> 40.28s]  come on Otto let's go and there are thousands of people just screaming but I don't even hear them
[41.61s -> 49.29s]  it's very odd to think about that like I'm in the bathroom just doing a full piss
[49.29s -> 54.07s]  and it's just dead silent in my bathroom and in the back of my mind I'm just thinking there's a
[54.07s -> 60.17s]  like there's probably two or three thousand people right now just yelling at me and I'm just there
[60.25s -> 72.78s]  I'm just here I better get in there anyways hello I am yelling yeah but I don't hear you
[73.42s -> 82.82s]  it's weird like I'm just I'm just existing outside with Otto and like it is the sun
[84.31s -> 117.05s]  like where's the fucking stream give us a piss cam okay I don't want to just just I'm that's
[117.21s -> 128.92s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow the gas got out all right so today today was supposed to be chat's
[128.92s -> 134.23s]  choice I said that yeah yesterday very very plainly I was like oh today's gonna be your
[134.23s -> 141.70s]  viewer's choice he had a lot of trouble deciding I had to eliminate it was AI dungeon with the
[141.70s -> 152.15s]  dragon engine or eternal darkness and it was almost a straight 50 50 split on each pole so
[152.15s -> 159.35s]  what I've decided to do is I'm just gonna play AI dungeon for a little while I don't know once
[159.35s -> 166.10s]  I'm kind of like yeah that was fun I did buy the thing like the game apparently I don't know
[166.10s -> 172.90s]  anything about this I was told in the last AI dungeon stream that hey dude buy the new buy the
[172.90s -> 177.94s]  good one buy the one that has like actual it's like a better version it's a better engine it
[177.94s -> 184.30s]  has better AI training like I'm holy that's fucking all right let's go so I got it it's
[184.30s -> 193.62s]  currently active it apparently it does I've never done it before so that I mean why not give it a
[193.62s -> 199.62s]  try when I'm done with this or if I might be stuck here for four or five hours this might be the
[199.62s -> 206.34s]  stream but I intend on eventually maybe moving over to eternal darkness for the game cube that's
[206.34s -> 218.02s]  set up it's ready to go oh mega pog yeah easy lying again prove that I have eternal darkness
[219.40s -> 224.68s]  um no you'll see it in like a few hours if I have it or not so why don't you stick around why don't
[224.68s -> 229.85s]  you watch the stream then you want that answer maybe you'll get it but you gotta you've got to
[229.85s -> 240.95s]  stick around and watch the whole thing how will you ever know scamming scamming view wait scam
[241.51s -> 250.65s]  all right let's get to this I have to put on some music though because uh streamers without music
[251.67s -> 265.82s]  are like singers without voices so I'm sorry I have to put on something why you question marks
[265.82s -> 275.00s]  are you talking about how am I getting question marks it means it means that you have to have music
[275.00s -> 279.08s]  if you're a streamer in the background if you're just doing like hit sitting around irl stuff
[279.08s -> 288.02s]  otherwise you can't you can't it's impossible it's and you can't do it I tried who the fuck said
[288.02s -> 299.37s]  Lisa the painful ost I didn't all right I'm about to okay what is 100 gecks just what is it I don't

[339.70s -> 354.06s]  videos to me okay well no more why would I play any more than that
[357.02s -> 370.79s]  the question is did you like it I don't know the answer is no but whatever I'm I'm like 35
[375.10s -> 382.54s]  I listen my music I listen to is like Lost Odyssey theme song like the first two Gorillaz albums
[383.18s -> 389.66s]  and like Bon Jovi when I get a chance I don't I don't I don't even know what this is

[561.98s -> 569.32s]  life so I'm sorry I listen to that sometimes and of course I listen to freddy dread too
[569.96s -> 579.43s]  freddy dreads music and I'm just saying that because he just gave 50 community subs that's
[579.43s -> 592.52s]  a fucking ton though dude you all right you are you drop huge money all the time that's
[592.52s -> 605.94s]  a pogchamp moment freddy dread is a is a musician uh when you would call I guess you'd call a rapper

[737.72s -> 743.90s]  around the room and see three doors one door has a physician's office sign above it another has an
[743.90s -> 755.72s]  x-ray sign above it and the last says exit I go to the x-ray machine okay go what do you do

[789.58s -> 793.42s]  will upset balance of omega-6 to omega-3 ratio the majority of nuts especially peanut butter
[793.42s -> 797.66s]  which is concentrated contains very high amounts of omega-6 which is the unhealthy oil you want to
[797.66s -> 801.58s]  lower is similar to eating large tablespoons of canola or vegetable oil which causes severe
[801.58s -> 809.85s]  inflammation in your body and upsets gut bacteria I eat tuna and salmon like four days a week dude
[810.73s -> 822.39s]  well my omegas are my omega lulls are going to be just fine now he's going to have all this

[830.97s -> 838.02s]  and find another hallway you see signs for x-ray radiology and outpatient lab this is a lot smarter
[838.02s -> 846.30s]  already I can already tell all right go to x-ray should I just like go in the x-ray machine
[846.86s -> 858.95s]  okay go to x-ray go get superpowers you go down the hall and through the door to your right you

[5289.18s -> 5299.26s]  You shuffle your feet along the mountain, trying to make it as little noise as possible.
[5299.26s -> 5300.54s]  Bullets fly past you.
[5300.54s -> 5301.66s]  You keep climbing.

[5511.79s -> 5514.76s]  Here we go.
[5514.76s -> 5517.02s]  You hear a yelp.
[5517.02s -> 5519.99s]  Who's there?
[5519.99s -> 5520.99s]  Who's there?
[5520.99s -> 5532.86s]  Jacob.
[5532.86s -> 5534.67s]  Is that you?
[5534.67s -> 5535.67s]  Yeah.
[5535.67s -> 5539.67s]  You see his face and he screams.
[5539.67s -> 5541.67s]  He seems to be in a state of shock.
[5541.67s -> 5546.20s]  What are you doing here?
[5546.20s -> 5553.84s]  Same thing.
[5553.84s -> 5554.84s]  You know what I mean?
[5554.84s -> 5565.55s]  I could ask you the same thing.
[5565.55s -> 5566.55s]  I don't know.
[5566.55s -> 5568.55s]  You see him stand up and he looks at you.
[5568.55s -> 5572.55s]  He doesn't seem to be wearing any clothes, but he doesn't seem cold.
[5572.55s -> 5579.90s]  Am I dead?
[5579.90s -> 5580.90s]  Whoa.
[5580.90s -> 5590.20s]  I would be like, whoa.
[5590.20s -> 5591.20s]  What?
[5591.20s -> 5592.20s]  You're dead.
[5592.20s -> 5593.20s]  I'm dead.
[5593.20s -> 5595.20s]  He looks down at his hands, begins shaking.
[5595.20s -> 5597.38s]  Then he looks up at you.
[5597.38s -> 5598.38s]  We're dead.
[5598.38s -> 5599.38s]  You nod slowly.
[5599.38s -> 5606.57s]  Help me up.
[5606.57s -> 5612.30s]  Aren't I hanging off the side of the mountain?
[5612.30s -> 5618.06s]  Grab his hand to help pull him up.
[5618.06s -> 5620.75s]  As soon as he stands, he begins to wobble.
[5620.75s -> 5621.75s]  He falls to the ground.
[5621.75s -> 5623.75s]  He realizes that his legs are broken.
[5623.75s -> 5632.82s]  Carry Jacob to the top of the mountain.
[5632.82s -> 5640.76s]  Put him out of his misery.
[5640.76s -> 5641.76s]  What?
[5641.76s -> 5655.10s]  Carry...
[5655.10s -> 5657.10s]  Okay, you stand up and walk over to Jacob.
[5657.10s -> 5660.10s]  He's sitting in a puddle of his own blood.
[5660.10s -> 5663.10s]  Help!
[5664.10s -> 5674.42s]  You grab him under the arms and begin dragging him up the mountain.
[5674.42s -> 5676.42s]  Get to the top.
[5676.42s -> 5681.59s]  How's AI doing?
[5681.59s -> 5690.13s]  Lie down next to him.
[5690.13s -> 5693.13s]  You laugh and then begin to cry.
[5693.13s -> 5694.13s]  What do we do now?
[5694.13s -> 5695.13s]  He asks.
[5695.13s -> 5700.40s]  You begin laughing again.
[5700.40s -> 5701.40s]  Competitive.
[5701.40s -> 5702.40s]  It's been pretty good.
[5702.40s -> 5703.40s]  It's been pretty good.
[5703.40s -> 5708.31s]  It's been fun.
[5708.31s -> 5710.94s]  Start laughing harder.
[5710.94s -> 5714.26s]  We can't believe it.
[5714.26s -> 5717.26s]  We made it to the top, but it's hysterical because we're both so fucked up.
[5717.26s -> 5718.26s]  This is crazy.
[5718.26s -> 5719.26s]  Might as well just laugh.
[5719.26s -> 5720.26s]  What else can we do?
[5720.26s -> 5727.19s]  You roll around in the snow laughing at nothing for no reason.
[5727.19s -> 5729.19s]  Why are you laughing?
[5729.19s -> 5732.89s]  Stop laughing and look at him.
[5732.89s -> 5733.89s]  Point and laugh.
[5733.89s -> 5742.10s]  You point and laugh.
[5742.10s -> 5745.10s]  You begin laughing again and you point at him.
[5745.10s -> 5748.10s]  You look at the trees and begin to laugh at the trees.
[5748.10s -> 5749.10s]  He gets up and...
[5749.10s -> 5758.22s]  I can't...
[5758.22s -> 5761.22s]  He gets up and begins running in circles.
[5761.22s -> 5768.13s]  I just pictured him as a dog.
[5768.13s -> 5769.13s]  Like, is he a dog?
[5769.13s -> 5783.87s]  Let's let the AI take care of this one for a little while.
[5783.87s -> 5784.87s]  I don't understand.
[5784.87s -> 5785.87s]  He says.
[5785.87s -> 5786.87s]  You begin laughing again.
[5786.87s -> 5788.87s]  Suddenly you hear a loud noise.
[5788.87s -> 5795.46s]  It's the sound of a gun.
[5795.46s -> 5796.46s]  They stop moving.
[5796.46s -> 5800.52s]  Hide.
[5800.52s -> 5802.08s]  No.
[5802.08s -> 5809.31s]  Hide behind that shed.
[5809.31s -> 5814.73s]  Hide behind that glacier.
[5814.73s -> 5815.73s]  Hide behind that quick.
[5815.73s -> 5824.62s]  Hide behind that glacier.
[5824.62s -> 5826.62s]  Wrap him and quickly make your way over to the glacier.
[5826.62s -> 5828.62s]  You both duck down behind it.
[5828.62s -> 5829.62s]  Are they gone?
[5829.62s -> 5831.12s]  I don't know.
[5831.12s -> 5840.40s]  You should peek.
[5840.40s -> 5848.63s]  You should peek around the corner, Jacob.
[5848.63s -> 5852.75s]  Hello?
[5852.75s -> 5858.58s]  Jacob slowly peeks around the corner of the mountain.
[5858.58s -> 5860.58s]  He immediately ducks back down.
[5860.58s -> 5862.58s]  They're still there.
[5862.58s -> 5863.58s]  Are they looking this way?
[5863.58s -> 5864.58s]  You ask.
[5864.58s -> 5869.14s]  No.
[5869.14s -> 5879.95s]  Say, Jacob, go run out there and wave your arms in the air screaming.
[5879.95s -> 5902.42s]  Say, Jacob, go run out there and wave your arms in the air screaming.
[5902.42s -> 5903.72s]  What?
[5903.72s -> 5904.72s]  Jacob says.
[5904.72s -> 5905.72s]  Go ahead.
[5905.72s -> 5907.72s]  Jacob slowly stands up.
[5907.72s -> 5910.72s]  He begins walking to the direction of the fortress.
[5910.72s -> 5911.96s]  What's going on?
[5911.96s -> 5920.79s]  What color is the fortress?
[5920.79s -> 5922.79s]  How big is the fortress?
[5922.79s -> 5925.79s]  How big is the fortress?
[5925.79s -> 5936.76s]  AI doesn't know.
[5936.76s -> 5937.76s]  Okay.
[5937.76s -> 5939.76s]  AI doesn't know what's going on.
[5939.76s -> 5942.34s]  What's going on?
[5942.34s -> 5944.86s]  Let's go.
[5944.86s -> 5949.66s]  Sacrifice Jacob.
[5949.66s -> 5954.36s]  Here we go.
[5954.36s -> 5956.11s]  Let's go.
[5956.11s -> 5959.11s]  You stand up and begin running towards the fortress.
[5959.11s -> 5962.11s]  Once you get there, you hear a loud bang and everything turns black.
[5962.11s -> 5995.92s]  You wipe the cartoon black smoke off your face and keep running.
[5995.92s -> 5998.22s]  You rush into the fortress, guns blazing.
[5998.22s -> 6001.22s]  You go up to the first guard that you see and you stab him through the neck.
[6001.22s -> 6003.46s]  You run up to the next and do the same.
[6003.46s -> 6004.46s]  Why am I doing this?
[6004.46s -> 6008.78s]  Look for Jacob.
[6008.78s -> 6009.78s]  It's okay.
[6009.78s -> 6021.68s]  It's just a cartoon knife.
[6021.68s -> 6028.14s]  Outright violence.
[6028.14s -> 6029.14s]  You look for Jacob.
[6029.14s -> 6030.14s]  Well, where is he?
[6030.14s -> 6031.14s]  Come on.
[6031.14s -> 6032.14s]  Where's Jacob?
[6032.14s -> 6044.68s]  You look around and see Jacob on the floor, his face covered in soot and blood.
[6044.68s -> 6046.68s]  Jacob, you say.
[6046.68s -> 6048.68s]  He slowly turns his head to face you.
[6048.68s -> 6059.98s]  It was Looney Tunes soot.
[6059.98s -> 6070.06s]  Already did that joke.
[6070.06s -> 6071.06s]  Not to somebody else.
[6071.06s -> 6074.51s]  You wipe the soot and blood off his face.
[6074.51s -> 6076.51s]  He slowly opens his eyes, revealing his sad eyes.
[6076.51s -> 6078.51s]  Am I dead?
[6078.51s -> 6079.51s]  Yes, you reply.
[6079.51s -> 6080.51s]  Really?
[6080.51s -> 6089.56s]  Yes.
[6089.56s -> 6090.80s]  Really.
[6090.80s -> 6093.77s]  He's dead.
[6093.77s -> 6095.77s]  Why does everybody ask if they die?
[6095.77s -> 6097.77s]  Everybody asks if they're dead.
[6097.77s -> 6104.45s]  Say yes, really.
[6104.45s -> 6106.45s]  Really, you reply.
[6106.45s -> 6108.88s]  You hear a scream.
[6108.88s -> 6109.88s]  It's Ethel.
[6109.88s -> 6111.88s]  He slowly begins to rise.
[6111.88s -> 6113.88s]  I'm so scared.
[6113.88s -> 6114.88s]  He yells.
[6114.88s -> 6116.88s]  Now you begin to rise, too.
[6116.88s -> 6127.30s]  Grab the table.
[6127.30s -> 6129.30s]  Grab and hold the table.
[6129.30s -> 6131.30s]  I don't float anymore.
[6131.30s -> 6141.54s]  Table's not going to come up with me, right?
[6141.54s -> 6150.43s]  Is Ethel the hologram?
[6150.43s -> 6153.53s]  Maybe.
[6153.53s -> 6159.93s]  Oh, yeah, right.
[6159.93s -> 6161.87s]  Grab and hold the table.
[6161.87s -> 6163.87s]  Your hands go through the table.
[6163.87s -> 6168.87s]  The rest of your body slowly follows until you completely rise out of your chair and into the air.
[6168.87s -> 6175.68s]  All right, keep going.
[6175.68s -> 6176.68s]  What else you got?
[6176.68s -> 6184.10s]  What's going on, you ask?
[6184.10s -> 6187.47s]  I think this is heaven, Ethel says.
[6187.47s -> 6189.47s]  Oh, you reply.
[6189.47s -> 6193.10s]  The walls begin to turn into a bright white light.
[6193.10s -> 6200.35s]  I have a question for God.
[6200.35s -> 6215.94s]  You begin floating towards the light, as does Jacob.
[6215.94s -> 6218.44s]  What are you doing, Jacob?
[6218.44s -> 6220.44s]  I don't know, he says.
[6220.44s -> 6223.44s]  Jacob begins levitating towards the white light.
[6223.44s -> 6231.02s]  Float into the light.
[6231.02s -> 6235.24s]  Jacob belongs in hell?
[6235.24s -> 6238.24s]  Should I push Jacob down?
[6238.24s -> 6240.44s]  Float into the light.
[6240.44s -> 6243.44s]  Once inside, you see a man in white robe sitting on a chair.
[6243.44s -> 6245.44s]  Hello and welcome.
[6245.44s -> 6249.44s]  I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God, he says.
[6249.44s -> 6256.97s]  Can I ask you a question?
[6256.97s -> 6267.59s]  Can I ask you a question?
[6267.59s -> 6270.22s]  Of course, Jesus replies.
[6270.22s -> 6273.84s]  What did you really think of the world?
[6273.84s -> 6279.19s]  I loved it, he replies.
[6279.19s -> 6287.77s]  What happens when you die, Jesus?
[6287.77s -> 6296.58s]  You get to come to heaven, he says, smiling.
[6296.58s -> 6298.07s]  Forever?
[6298.07s -> 6299.25s]  Forever.
[6299.25s -> 6301.49s]  Jacob and Ethel both nod in agreement.
[6301.49s -> 6303.49s]  That sounds great.
[6303.49s -> 6336.69s]  Say, do you care that I had six marriages and only eight ground beef my entire life?
[6336.69s -> 6340.70s]  No, no, no, we're going to stick with this one.
[6340.70s -> 6343.70s]  I've just lived such a meat-filled life.
[6344.70s -> 6355.62s]  Do you care that I had six marriages?
[6355.62s -> 6358.35s]  That many?
[6358.35s -> 6360.35s]  I guess that's a lot.
[6360.35s -> 6362.35s]  Don't worry about it.
[6362.35s -> 6369.48s]  It's okay.
[6369.48s -> 6371.98s]  Don't worry about it.
[6371.98s -> 6372.98s]  It's okay.
[6372.98s -> 6401.71s]  Wait, do you care that all those marriages were me cheating on all of my wives?
[6401.71s -> 6404.02s]  That's what was sin, right?
[6404.02s -> 6405.02s]  We got gluttony?
[6405.02s -> 6407.02s]  All I ate was ground beef.
[6407.02s -> 6408.02s]  No, we didn't do gluttony.
[6408.02s -> 6422.44s]  We didn't do gluttony.
[6422.44s -> 6425.44s]  Do you mind that I only ate ground beef until I got big and fat?
[6425.44s -> 6444.94s]  Do you mind that I only ate ground beef until I got big and fat?
[6444.94s -> 6447.43s]  That's fine, too.
[6447.43s -> 6450.44s]  Jacob, do you have any more questions?
[6450.44s -> 6453.06s]  Jacob shakes his head.
[6453.06s -> 6455.06s]  I don't think so.
[6455.06s -> 6457.56s]  Come on, let's go.
[6457.56s -> 6464.58s]  Okay, lost.
[6464.58s -> 6470.22s]  I only care about money.
[6470.22s -> 6484.19s]  You, Jacob, and Ethel rise up into the sky.
[6484.19s -> 6486.19s]  Well, that's it for this chapter.
[6486.19s -> 6487.19s]  Thanks for reading.
[6487.19s -> 6489.97s]  All right, close the book.
[6489.97s -> 6491.97s]  Where the fuck am I?
[6491.97s -> 6494.87s]  Where am I?
[6494.87s -> 6498.29s]  Close the book.
[6498.29s -> 6500.66s]  This was just a movie stream.
[6500.66s -> 6505.39s]  Played out the exact same way.
[6505.39s -> 6514.98s]  Okay, let's do another one.
[6514.98s -> 6524.26s]  How about zombies?
[6524.26s -> 6528.67s]  Do fantasy?
[6528.67s -> 6530.67s]  Let's do fantasy.
[6530.67s -> 6536.62s]  Noble Princess Knight, Wizard, Witch, Ranger, Squire, Peasant.
[6536.62s -> 6537.62s]  Let's be a peasant.
[6537.62s -> 6538.62s]  Peasant.
[6538.62s -> 6544.27s]  What's a good peasant name?
[6544.27s -> 6548.26s]  Jacob.
[6548.26s -> 6552.96s]  Jacob.
[6552.96s -> 6558.50s]  Are we going to continue Jacob's story here?
[6558.50s -> 6560.64s]  Schwab?
[6560.64s -> 6565.78s]  Here we go.
[6565.78s -> 6573.30s]  Okay, you are Jacob.
[6573.30s -> 6578.42s]  Let me get some music.
[6578.42s -> 6587.43s]  Okay, you are Jacob, a peasant living in a small village in the kingdom of Larian.
[6587.43s -> 6589.43s]  You have a pitchfork and nothing else.
[6589.43s -> 6592.43s]  You dream of getting out of your village and having an adventure.
[6592.43s -> 6595.43s]  You go to your fields and begin working.
[6595.43s -> 6597.43s]  You look up and see your friend Anthony there.
[6597.43s -> 6599.63s]  Hey, Jacob.
[6599.63s -> 6602.63s]  You'll never guess what I heard in the tavern last night.
[6602.63s -> 6603.63s]  He says to you.
[6603.63s -> 6604.87s]  I don't know.
[6604.87s -> 6605.87s]  What?
[6605.87s -> 6607.88s]  Okay.
[6607.88s -> 6609.88s]  I can't add anything there.
[6609.88s -> 6618.05s]  There's a dragon to the south of here, like a real dragon.
[6618.05s -> 6620.05s]  Not a wyvern or a drake.
[6620.05s -> 6623.05s]  It's been terrorizing the nearby villages.
[6623.05s -> 6625.70s]  Really?
[6625.70s -> 6637.84s]  Hey, that's horrible.
[6637.84s -> 6644.24s]  Same voice, new effects.
[6644.24s -> 6645.24s]  Omega Low.
[6645.24s -> 6646.24s]  Get that guy out of here.
[6646.24s -> 6648.24s]  Ban that guy for like a year.
[6648.24s -> 6651.25s]  That's horrible.
[6651.25s -> 6660.21s]  Yeah, I know, Anthony.
[6660.21s -> 6661.21s]  Yeah, I know.
[6661.21s -> 6663.21s]  I wish I had the courage to go fight it.
[6663.21s -> 6666.47s]  What if it kills you?
[6666.47s -> 6670.71s]  A valiant death is preferable to a life of cowardice.
[6670.71s -> 6680.85s]  Do you want to go get to the bar?
[6680.85s -> 6683.85s]  Do you want to go to the inn?
[6683.85s -> 6685.47s]  Talk about it.
[6685.47s -> 6688.47s]  Look, I'm not just going to climb the ice fountain again.
[6688.47s -> 6690.47s]  You want to go to the inn?
[6690.47s -> 6692.47s]  You want to go to the inn?
[6692.47s -> 6701.62s]  Sure, says Anthony.
[6701.62s -> 6703.62s]  At the inn, you and Anthony have a few drinks.
[6703.62s -> 6707.36s]  Hey.
[6707.36s -> 6708.66s]  Damn.
[6708.66s -> 6710.97s]  I can't stop fucking thinking about this dragon.
[6710.97s -> 6711.97s]  This dragon, this dragon.
[6711.97s -> 6713.97s]  Since you brought it up, I can't fucking stop thinking about it.
[6713.97s -> 6715.34s]  Do we go get him?
[6715.34s -> 6716.34s]  I don't know.
[6716.34s -> 6717.34s]  Should I do it?
[6717.34s -> 6726.30s]  I can't stop thinking about that dragon.
[6726.30s -> 6733.94s]  Duncan Dragon.
[6733.94s -> 6737.88s]  Aw, don't worry about it, says Anthony.
[6737.88s -> 6742.46s]  Would you ever want...
[6742.46s -> 6744.46s]  Let's go see the wizard tomorrow.
[6744.46s -> 6751.12s]  Maybe he can help us.
[6751.12s -> 6762.45s]  Let's go see the wizard tomorrow.
[6762.45s -> 6763.45s]  Maybe he can help us.
[6763.45s -> 6766.45s]  Sure, why not, says Anthony.
[6766.45s -> 6769.74s]  Okay, bye.
[6769.74s -> 6771.74s]  You're like everybody that gets on the phone
[6771.74s -> 6773.74s]  and doesn't know how to say goodbye on the phone,
[6773.74s -> 6777.74s]  so you just kind of agree with or repeat everything I say
[6777.74s -> 6781.74s]  until one of us finally is like, I fucking have to leave.
[6781.74s -> 6793.14s]  Wave goodbye to Anthony.
[6793.14s -> 6802.89s]  Bye, Jacob.
[6802.89s -> 6805.32s]  Wave goodbye to your friend and head home.
[6805.32s -> 6806.32s]  There we are.
[6806.32s -> 6807.32s]  Okay, good.
[6807.32s -> 6817.97s]  We don't go see the wizard.
[6820.36s -> 6823.36s]  I'm just a regular guy in a kingdom.
[6823.36s -> 6824.86s]  That's it.
[6824.86s -> 6825.86s]  This is...
[6825.86s -> 6827.86s]  Oh, we're in a medieval fantasy fucking land.
[6827.86s -> 6828.86s]  This guy didn't have any powers.
[6828.86s -> 6830.86s]  He's just a regular guy.
[6830.86s -> 6833.48s]  There's no cool thing that happens.
[6833.48s -> 6835.04s]  Let's go over it.
[6835.04s -> 6838.82s]  Oh no, there's a dragon.
[6838.82s -> 6840.82s]  There's a dragon south of here, a real one.
[6840.82s -> 6842.82s]  Wow, I can't believe it.
[6842.82s -> 6843.82s]  That's horrible.
[6843.82s -> 6844.82s]  Yeah, I know.
[6844.82s -> 6846.82s]  Wish I had the courage to fight it.
[6846.82s -> 6847.82s]  I know, what if it kills you?
[6847.82s -> 6848.82s]  I have nothing.
[6848.82s -> 6850.82s]  I have no fucking weapons and no powers or anything.
[6850.82s -> 6852.82s]  I'm just a guy that works on the farm.
[6852.82s -> 6854.99s]  Yeah, valiant death.
[6854.99s -> 6855.99s]  You want to go to the inn?
[6855.99s -> 6856.99s]  Sure.
[6856.99s -> 6858.99s]  Okay, let's have some drinks.
[6858.99s -> 6860.99s]  I can't stop thinking about that dragon.
[6860.99s -> 6861.99s]  Yeah, I know.
[6861.99s -> 6862.99s]  Don't worry about it.
[6862.99s -> 6863.99s]  Maybe we should see the wizard tomorrow.
[6863.99s -> 6864.99s]  He can help us.
[6864.99s -> 6865.99s]  Yeah, sure.
[6865.99s -> 6866.99s]  Okay, bye.
[6866.99s -> 6869.49s]  I'll ask the wizard to go do the quest.
[6869.49s -> 6874.67s]  Never did this say I had anything.
[6874.67s -> 6877.67s]  Like I had some major adventure to do.
[6877.67s -> 6879.67s]  I said I want to.
[6879.67s -> 6882.67s]  I dream of getting out and having...
[6883.67s -> 6884.67s]  But that's not...
[6884.67s -> 6886.67s]  I live in reality right now.
[6886.67s -> 6890.02s]  I'm the wizard.
[6890.02s -> 6897.10s]  Of course, I have dreams of being an adventurer.
[6897.10s -> 6901.05s]  But the wizard has the powers.
[6901.05s -> 6910.46s]  Forever an NPC.
[6913.98s -> 6921.41s]  In fact, that was NPC underscore 118
[6921.41s -> 6926.35s]  talking to NPC underscore 119.
[6926.35s -> 6930.90s]  When you walk into the inn as a fucking Skyrim character.
[6930.90s -> 6935.95s]  That's all that was.
[6935.95s -> 6941.75s]  Man, this dragon, I can't believe it.
[6941.75s -> 6942.75s]  Neither can I.
[6942.75s -> 6944.75s]  I wish one day we could get rid of that dragon.
[6944.75s -> 6945.75s]  Yeah.
[6945.75s -> 6947.75s]  We should maybe go see the wizard.
[6947.75s -> 6948.75s]  Yeah.
[6948.75s -> 6950.93s]  Don't you think that's a great idea?
[6950.93s -> 6951.93s]  Sure.
[6951.93s -> 6957.18s]  I'm not going to get NPC'd here.
[6957.18s -> 6961.12s]  I am a ranger.
[6961.12s -> 6964.00s]  Is this copyright music?
[6964.00s -> 6966.07s]  Oh, fuck.
[6966.07s -> 6967.07s]  All right.
[6967.07s -> 6975.61s]  Be a wizard.
[6975.61s -> 6976.61s]  I do a wizard every time.
[6976.61s -> 6980.61s]  I have to do at least one non-wizard gameplay.
[6980.61s -> 6981.61s]  I'll do ranger.
[6981.61s -> 6985.70s]  Yes, that is the way to say it.
[6985.70s -> 6987.33s]  It's not ranger.
[6987.33s -> 6989.33s]  It's ranger.
[6989.33s -> 6991.72s]  All right.
[6991.72s -> 6992.72s]  What's a good OST?
[6992.72s -> 6993.72s]  No, no.
[6993.72s -> 6999.58s]  That's got to be like royalty-free jazz.
[6999.58s -> 7001.66s]  No, that doesn't make sense.
[7001.66s -> 7004.96s]  Royalty-free choir.
[7004.96s -> 7008.70s]  Emotional choir.
[7008.70s -> 7009.70s]  No.
[7009.70s -> 7012.70s]  Godhand OST.
[7012.70s -> 7017.12s]  Is this any good?
[7017.12s -> 7020.28s]  Not too arcadey.
[7020.28s -> 7021.28s]  Too arcadey.
[7021.28s -> 7022.28s]  Celeste.
[7022.28s -> 7023.78s]  Oh, yeah.
[7023.78s -> 7024.78s]  That's a good one.
[7024.78s -> 7031.07s]  Okay.
[7031.07s -> 7036.60s]  Here we go.
[7036.60s -> 7037.60s]  Nintendo Labo.
[7037.60s -> 7040.70s]  What's your character's name?
[7040.70s -> 7043.60s]  I'm a ranger.
[7043.60s -> 7046.25s]  Von Darlo.
[7046.25s -> 7050.62s]  Real Ralph?
[7050.62s -> 7051.62s]  No.
[7051.62s -> 7055.23s]  Real Ruff.
[7055.23s -> 7060.76s]  Real Tough.
[7060.76s -> 7061.76s]  What was the guy's name?
[7061.76s -> 7062.76s]  Slop.
[7062.76s -> 7063.76s]  I'm not going to even.
[7063.76s -> 7064.76s]  No, no.
[7064.76s -> 7067.98s]  Okay.
[7067.98s -> 7068.98s]  Doug is okay.
[7068.98s -> 7069.98s]  How about Doug?
[7069.98s -> 7070.98s]  Doug Shlop.
[7070.98s -> 7072.80s]  That's such a shitty ranger name.
[7072.80s -> 7073.80s]  You are Doug Shlop.
[7073.80s -> 7079.52s]  A ranger.
[7079.52s -> 7080.52s]  A ranger.
[7080.52s -> 7081.52s]  A ranger.
[7081.52s -> 7086.66s]  A ranger.
[7086.66s -> 7087.66s]  A ranger.
[7087.66s -> 7088.66s]  A ranger.
[7088.66s -> 7091.34s]  A ranger living in the Kingdom of Larian.
[7091.34s -> 7094.66s]  You have a hunting bow and a quiver of arrows.
[7094.66s -> 7097.82s]  You've been searching for a mystical beast for three months, tracking it through the
[7097.82s -> 7099.10s]  forest.
[7099.10s -> 7101.30s]  As you crouch behind a clump of trees, you see it.
[7101.30s -> 7107.65s]  It is a large black cat with a long tail that stands on its hind legs and looks like a man,
[7107.65s -> 7109.61s]  but with fur all over its body.
[7109.61s -> 7124.77s]  You just immediately shoot it with the arrow?
[7124.77s -> 7127.50s]  First of all, that's what I'm hunting.
[7128.73s -> 7133.55s]  I'm going to look at my map.
[7133.55s -> 7134.55s]  I need to see.
[7134.55s -> 7142.79s]  You look at your map and see where you are and you make a note of it.
[7142.79s -> 7144.79s]  You then look for potential escape routes.
[7144.79s -> 7152.71s]  Which way would you run?
[7152.71s -> 7153.95s]  That's cat.
[7153.95s -> 7155.26s]  Look at the cat.
[7155.26s -> 7156.26s]  Look at the cat's food.
[7156.26s -> 7157.50s]  I don't know.
[7157.50s -> 7159.82s]  What is it eating?
[7159.82s -> 7160.82s]  Does it eat?
[7160.82s -> 7161.82s]  Is it a vegetarian?
[7161.82s -> 7162.82s]  Is it a herbivore?
[7162.82s -> 7163.82s]  A carnivore?
[7163.82s -> 7167.69s]  You look at the dead deer on the ground.
[7167.69s -> 7168.69s]  Thank you.
[7168.69s -> 7169.69s]  The cat?
[7169.69s -> 7170.69s]  A panther.
[7170.69s -> 7172.05s]  Has two more just like it besides the corpse.
[7178.19s -> 7179.19s]  Let's try this one.
[7179.19s -> 7198.26s]  You ask if you can share some of the deer.
[7198.26s -> 7201.70s]  You slowly put your bow down and raise your hands.
[7201.70s -> 7205.78s]  You slowly approach the deer carcasses and the panther does not move.
[7205.78s -> 7209.06s]  Easy.
[7209.06s -> 7210.56s]  Easy.
[7210.56s -> 7212.12s]  Easy.
[7212.12s -> 7225.36s]  You say easy, putty tat.
[7225.36s -> 7230.71s]  Which is a reference to the popular movie Dead.
[7230.71s -> 7232.83s]  Walk towards the deer and the panther does not move.
[7232.83s -> 7238.29s]  Is that a reference to Dead?
[7238.29s -> 7242.28s]  Okay.
[7243.12s -> 7245.12s]  I'm close enough now.
[7245.12s -> 7257.95s]  Do you mind if I sit down?
[7257.95s -> 7258.95s]  Popular movie Dead.
[7258.95s -> 7261.74s]  Do you mind if I sit down?
[7261.74s -> 7263.50s]  The panther stares at you silently.
[7263.50s -> 7265.22s]  You sit down and take a rest for a minute.
[7265.22s -> 7278.43s]  You say, I can't believe I've been out here three days.
[7278.43s -> 7298.10s]  It's been three months.
[7298.10s -> 7302.18s]  I've lost my mind.
[7302.18s -> 7305.67s]  Wow, I can't believe it.
[7305.71s -> 7310.40s]  It's not been that long, but holy shit, three days is a long darn time.
[7310.40s -> 7311.40s]  Three fucking months.
[7311.40s -> 7313.98s]  Okay.
[7313.98s -> 7315.98s]  I can't believe I've been out here for three days.
[7315.98s -> 7317.78s]  The panther continues to make no reaction.
[7317.78s -> 7321.47s]  You begin to feel tired and lay down next to the panther.
[7321.47s -> 7347.91s]  We're lying down looking up at the sky.
[7347.91s -> 7354.74s]  You know, I always thought the stars were just big lightning bolts from other planets.
[7354.74s -> 7355.74s]  So stupid.
[7355.74s -> 7363.89s]  So young.
[7363.89s -> 7373.88s]  The panther begins to slowly move towards you and sniffs your neck.
[7379.29s -> 7381.29s]  I was just a big dumb idiot.
[7381.29s -> 7402.08s]  I mean, I was just a big dumb idiot kid trying to make sense of the world.
[7402.08s -> 7428.69s]  The panther suddenly leaps on you and tears your throat out.
[7428.69s -> 7431.29s]  I went out here on an expedition and got delirious in three months.
[7431.29s -> 7435.19s]  Started talking to a cat.
[7435.19s -> 7439.97s]  Like it was going to talk back.
[7439.97s -> 7444.13s]  Oh, good work, Doug Shlopp.
[7444.13s -> 7445.13s]  Excellent.
[7445.13s -> 7446.13s]  You did.
[7446.13s -> 7458.82s]  You got your bounty.
[7458.82s -> 7459.82s]  This one can't.
[7459.82s -> 7460.82s]  I don't think this one goes on anymore.
[7460.82s -> 7464.30s]  That's the end.
[7464.30s -> 7465.48s]  That's it for that one.
[7465.48s -> 7466.48s]  I'm going to be a squire.
[7466.48s -> 7472.01s]  Character's name.
[7472.01s -> 7473.01s]  What about eternal darkness?
[7473.01s -> 7474.01s]  It's only been a couple hours.
[7474.01s -> 7477.94s]  We'll do like another couple.
[7477.94s -> 7480.97s]  Let me go pee first, actually.
[7480.97s -> 7484.58s]  I'm going to piss.
[7484.58s -> 7485.58s]  I'll be right back.
[7485.58s -> 7487.58s]  Oh, man.
[7487.58s -> 7490.36s]  I just got hurt in the bathroom.
[7490.36s -> 7491.36s]  I actually just got hurt in the bathroom.
[7491.36s -> 7492.36s]  I started.
[7492.36s -> 7493.36s]  Okay.
[7493.36s -> 7494.36s]  I started just laughing.
[7494.36s -> 7587.70s]  I started pissing.
[7587.70s -> 7588.70s]  And it was, it was a full big 60 seconds.
[7588.70s -> 7589.70s]  I'm going to piss.
[7589.70s -> 7590.70s]  I'm going to piss.
[7590.70s -> 7591.70s]  I'm going to piss.
[7591.70s -> 7593.19s]  I'm going to piss.
[7593.19s -> 7594.19s]  I'm going to piss.
[7594.19s -> 7595.19s]  I'm going to piss.
[7596.19s -> 7597.19s]  I'm going to piss.
[7597.19s -> 7598.19s]  I'm going to piss.
[7598.19s -> 7599.19s]  I'm going to piss.
[7599.19s -> 7600.19s]  I'm going to piss.
[7600.19s -> 7601.19s]  I'm going to piss.
[7601.19s -> 7602.19s]  I'm going to piss.
[7602.19s -> 7603.19s]  I'm going to piss.
[7603.19s -> 7604.19s]  I'm going to piss.
[7604.19s -> 7605.19s]  I'm going to piss.
[7605.19s -> 7606.19s]  I'm going to piss.
[7606.19s -> 7607.37s]  I'm going to piss.
[7607.37s -> 7608.37s]  I'm going to piss.
[7608.37s -> 7609.37s]  I'm going to piss.
[7609.37s -> 7610.37s]  I'm going to piss.
[7610.37s -> 7611.37s]  I'm going to piss.
[7611.37s -> 7612.37s]  I'm going to piss.

[7618.37s -> 7619.37s]  I'm going to piss.
[7619.37s -> 7620.37s]  I'm going to piss.
[7620.37s -> 7621.37s]  I'm going to piss.
[7621.37s -> 7622.37s]  I'm going to piss.
[7622.37s -> 7623.37s]  I'm going to piss.
[7623.37s -> 7625.38s]  I'm going to piss.
[7625.38s -> 7626.38s]  I'm going to piss.
[7626.38s -> 7627.38s]  I'm going to piss.
[7627.38s -> 7628.38s]  I'm going to piss.
[7628.38s -> 7629.38s]  I'm going to piss.
[7629.38s -> 7630.38s]  I'm going to piss.
[7630.38s -> 7631.38s]  I'm going to piss.
[7631.38s -> 7632.38s]  I'm going to piss.

[7647.00s -> 7648.00s]  I'm going to piss.
[7648.00s -> 7650.39s]  I'm going to piss.
[7650.39s -> 7655.09s]  I'm going to piss.
[7656.09s -> 7657.09s]  I'm going to piss.
[7657.09s -> 7658.09s]  I'm going to piss.
[7658.09s -> 7747.20s]  I'm going to piss.
[7747.20s -> 7749.83s]  I'm going to piss.
[7749.83s -> 7750.83s]  I'm going to piss.
[7750.83s -> 7754.18s]  I'm going to piss.
[7754.18s -> 7756.83s]  I'm going to piss.
[7756.83s -> 7760.44s]  I'm going to piss.
[7760.44s -> 7762.13s]  I'm going to piss.
[7762.13s -> 7765.80s]  I'm going to piss.
[7765.80s -> 7768.64s]  I'm going to piss.
[7768.64s -> 7769.64s]  I'm going to piss.
[7769.64s -> 7776.13s]  I'm going to piss.
[7776.13s -> 7777.13s]  I'm going to piss.

[7784.70s -> 7785.70s]  I'm going to piss.
[7785.70s -> 7786.70s]  I'm going to piss.
[7786.70s -> 7787.70s]  It was worth it.
[7787.70s -> 7788.70s]  It was worth it.
[7788.70s -> 7789.70s]  I'll take that.
[7789.70s -> 7791.19s]  I will take that pain.
[7791.19s -> 7792.19s]  Oh my god.
[7792.19s -> 7793.62s]  That was so stupid.
[7793.62s -> 7794.62s]  All right.
[7794.62s -> 7796.25s]  Here we go.
[7796.25s -> 7800.61s]  You are Walter, a squire living in the kingdom of Larian.
[7800.61s -> 7803.99s]  You have a spear and a pack of supplies.
[7803.99s -> 7806.97s]  You follow Sir Theo as he enters the forest.
[7806.97s -> 7812.63s]  He turns to you and says, if we split up, we'll find the orcs much quicker.
[7812.63s -> 7817.31s]  Very well, sir, you reply, knowing he is far more experienced in fighting than you are.
[7817.31s -> 7828.03s]  I'm not going to split up, I'm going to follow him.
[7828.03s -> 7831.36s]  Silently follow Sir Theo.
[7831.36s -> 7841.67s]  Yeah, I'm going to be hiding behind him and see.
[7841.67s -> 7844.95s]  Hey, you silently follow Sir Theo into the forest.
[7844.95s -> 7849.46s]  Quietly, you sneak forward, moving slowly so as not to make any noise.
[7849.46s -> 7853.78s]  You look around, taking in your surroundings and noting that the trees are getting thicker.
[7853.78s -> 7867.40s]  Continue to follow Sir Theo.
[7867.40s -> 7872.54s]  You continue to follow Sir Theo, ducking under branches and taking care not to trip.
[7872.54s -> 7875.02s]  You hear a twig snap behind you and pause.
[7875.02s -> 7879.58s]  Isn't that just me?
[7879.58s -> 7881.46s]  I'm ripping through twigs and stuff?
[7881.46s -> 7882.46s]  That's me?
[7882.46s -> 7883.46s]  I'm doing that.
[7883.46s -> 7887.00s]  Turn around.
[7887.00s -> 7899.77s]  You turn around and grab your spear tightly, calling out, who's there?
[7899.77s -> 7904.35s]  You hear a faint laugh and response and quickly jab your spear in the direction of the noise.
[7904.35s -> 7906.04s]  Gotcha!
[7906.04s -> 7907.04s]  The voice says.
[7907.04s -> 7910.97s]  I didn't get him?
[7910.97s -> 7917.01s]  Did you get me?
[7917.01s -> 7924.66s]  Turn around again and see Sir Theo behind you smiling.
[7924.66s -> 7929.22s]  You get jumpy over the smallest things, boy.
[7929.22s -> 7933.46s]  What is it?
[7933.46s -> 7934.46s]  Who are you?
[7934.46s -> 7935.46s]  Wait, is it?
[7935.46s -> 7936.70s]  Wait, it was him.
[7936.70s -> 7942.14s]  He pranked me.
[7942.14s -> 7946.12s]  Don't do that.
[7946.12s -> 7947.12s]  That's not funny.
[7947.12s -> 7957.51s]  Alright, I'm sorry.
[7957.51s -> 7958.51s]  Come on.
[7958.51s -> 7962.31s]  Better keep going.
[7962.31s -> 7964.91s]  He sets off into the forest again and you follow once more.
[7964.91s -> 7971.53s]  What's our mission?
[7971.53s -> 7977.40s]  Follow Sir Theo and enter the forest and as he turns, as we split, okay, so what's the
[7977.40s -> 7983.05s]  actual mission, though?
[7983.05s -> 7989.63s]  Sing a lovely song as we travel to kill orcs.
[7989.63s -> 7990.63s]  Okay, yeah, kill orcs.
[7990.63s -> 7995.26s]  Right, right, right.
[7995.26s -> 7996.86s]  You sing a lovely song.
[7996.86s -> 8005.69s]  Sir Theo takes a moment to think, then starts singing in a beautiful angelic voice.
[8005.69s -> 8019.05s]  Harmonize with Sir Theo.
[8019.05s -> 8022.33s]  Sir Theo smiles as you join in with his song.
[8022.33s -> 8025.05s]  The two of you sing together as you walk through the forest.
[8025.05s -> 8028.46s]  Wow, lovely.
[8028.46s -> 8035.87s]  What about the orcs?
[8035.87s -> 8040.27s]  Oh, right.
[8040.27s -> 8041.27s]  Where are the orcs?
[8041.27s -> 8051.01s]  It's a medieval musical.
[8051.01s -> 8052.81s]  Sir Theo looks around in frowns.
[8052.81s -> 8053.81s]  I don't know.
[8054.13s -> 8056.37s]  I thought we would have encountered them by now.
[8056.37s -> 8062.16s]  Oh, we need to keep a lookout just in case.
[8062.16s -> 8065.42s]  I'll take first shift.
[8065.42s -> 8078.18s]  Very well, Sir Theo says, sitting down on a rock.
[8078.18s -> 8081.15s]  I suggest you keep alert.
[8081.15s -> 8082.83s]  Orcs can show up at any moment.
[8082.83s -> 8097.85s]  Why do you sound like that?
[8097.85s -> 8099.33s]  Sir Theo looks confused.
[8099.33s -> 8102.09s]  I don't understand.
[8102.09s -> 8104.01s]  Your voice, it's all ruined.
[8104.01s -> 8128.47s]  Yes, it's a side effect of using too much power.
[8129.10s -> 8131.02s]  I'll get it back eventually.
[8131.02s -> 8133.50s]  Now wake me up in four hours.
[8133.50s -> 8140.02s]  With that, he lies down on the ground and closes his eyes.
[8140.02s -> 8159.05s]  Leave Sir Theo immediately.
[8159.05s -> 8160.61s]  You leave Sir Theo immediately.
[8160.61s -> 8165.19s]  As soon as your back is turned, Sir Theo teleports behind you.
[8165.19s -> 8168.78s]  He grabs your shoulders and whispers,
[8168.78s -> 8174.50s]  They're too trusting, boy.
[8174.50s -> 8182.66s]  OK, spin around.
[8182.66s -> 8185.90s]  Spin around with weapon in hand.
[8185.90s -> 8194.37s]  I'll tell you, this guy's a bad guy.
[8194.37s -> 8195.81s]  Spin around and swing your weapon.
[8195.81s -> 8197.65s]  But Sir Theo twists out of the way.
[8197.65s -> 8202.52s]  Your weapon cuts through the air and slices into his arm.
[8202.52s -> 8205.36s]  I thought he got, OK, blood begins to soak his sleeve
[8205.36s -> 8209.30s]  as he draws a sword.
[8209.30s -> 8212.19s]  What was your real plan?
[8212.19s -> 8213.35s]  Hmm?
[8213.35s -> 8217.25s]  Go, go hunt orcs in the fucking forest?
[8217.25s -> 8218.82s]  Lie.
[8218.82s -> 8223.15s]  You guys didn't catch that right away, I did.
[8223.15s -> 8226.70s]  Sir Theo looks down at his sword and sighs.
[8226.70s -> 8229.62s]  I was going to make sure you were safe.
[8229.62s -> 8231.82s]  But if you don't trust me now, I suppose
[8231.82s -> 8241.24s]  you don't have to live with that.
[8241.24s -> 8244.78s]  I'm sorry.
[8244.78s -> 8248.40s]  Thought you were a bad guy.
[8248.40s -> 8257.96s]  I thought you were evil.
[8257.96s -> 8262.90s]  What happened?
[8262.90s -> 8270.02s]  Where am I?
[8270.02s -> 8275.10s]  OK, so what has happened is I press the back button.
[8275.10s -> 8278.58s]  And this is when I searched for AI Dungeon an hour and a half
[8278.58s -> 8279.18s]  ago to play it.
[8279.18s -> 8284.61s]  And I spelt it just a little incorrect.
[8284.61s -> 8296.45s]  Just a little.
[8296.45s -> 8297.73s]  Fuck.
[8297.73s -> 8301.51s]  Now I can't.
[8301.51s -> 8306.15s]  I have to log in again.
[8306.15s -> 8308.43s]  No.
[8308.43s -> 8313.76s]  Hold on.
[8313.76s -> 8314.76s]  I just pressed forward.
[8314.76s -> 8315.56s]  Yeah, I just did it.
[8315.56s -> 8318.52s]  I pressed forward.
[8318.52s -> 8319.08s]  Damn it.
[8319.08s -> 8325.95s]  We were getting somewhere with that one, too.
[8325.95s -> 8329.11s]  It's because of the stupid mouse button.
[8329.11s -> 8331.11s]  OK, there's a back button on the on.
[8331.11s -> 8335.44s]  If you buy a razor mouse, your back thumb button
[8335.44s -> 8338.05s]  is going to be go back.
[8338.05s -> 8351.29s]  It saves it.
[8351.29s -> 8358.79s]  Please pray.
[8358.79s -> 8371.87s]  What?
[8371.87s -> 8381.89s]  Oh, sick.
[8381.89s -> 8384.98s]  I'm sorry, I thought you were evil.
[8384.98s -> 8386.51s]  I understand.
[8386.51s -> 8388.09s]  It's not your fault.
[8388.09s -> 8390.18s]  I should have told you my plan.
[8390.18s -> 8396.30s]  Sir Theo looks down and then looks you in the eye.
[8396.30s -> 8398.30s]  What is the plan, then?
[8398.30s -> 8409.98s]  What is the plan?
[8409.98s -> 8412.62s]  I need you to do exactly as I say.
[8412.62s -> 8417.43s]  Do you trust me?
[8417.43s -> 8420.54s]  Do I?
[8420.54s -> 8421.06s]  What if I just don't?
[8421.06s -> 8422.26s]  I don't think I trust him.
[8422.26s -> 8424.58s]  OK, yes.
[8424.58s -> 8425.30s]  No, I don't.
[8425.30s -> 8426.10s]  I'm going to be honest.
[8426.10s -> 8427.18s]  No, I don't trust you.
[8427.18s -> 8433.84s]  I don't.
[8433.84s -> 8435.00s]  You're not going to trust me.
[8435.00s -> 8437.71s]  This conversation is over.
[8437.71s -> 8439.48s]  Fine, I trust you.
[8439.48s -> 8442.02s]  Good.
[8442.02s -> 8444.38s]  I trust you.
[8444.38s -> 8453.72s]  I will do everything you say.
[8453.72s -> 8454.64s]  We got telltale?
[8454.64s -> 8458.94s]  Yeah.
[8458.94s -> 8459.54s]  Do you trust me?
[8459.54s -> 8461.06s]  Yes, you reply.
[8461.06s -> 8466.13s]  Good boy.
[8466.13s -> 8478.43s]  What's next?
[8478.43s -> 8480.12s]  We need to split up.
[8480.12s -> 8481.52s]  I'm going to head through the mountains
[8481.52s -> 8483.14s]  towards the Orc fortress.
[8483.14s -> 8485.17s]  You head north along the trade route
[8485.17s -> 8488.74s]  and meet up with Captain Brannock's men at the fortress.
[8488.74s -> 8492.10s]  I like that one better.
[8492.10s -> 8493.18s]  Head along the north trade route
[8493.18s -> 8497.94s]  and meet up with Captain Brannock.
[8497.94s -> 8502.07s]  I don't feel safe splitting up.
[8502.07s -> 8504.39s]  I'm a squire.
[8504.39s -> 8507.19s]  Isn't a squire supposed to follow around there at night?
[8507.19s -> 8509.39s]  Why would you tell a squire, go fuck off somewhere
[8509.39s -> 8516.64s]  and go get lost in the woods?
[8516.68s -> 8518.68s]  If we travel together and word gets around
[8518.68s -> 8522.60s]  that you're helping the knights, our plan will be ruined.
[8522.60s -> 8524.90s]  We need to keep you safe.
[8524.90s -> 8532.50s]  I don't like this plan.
[8532.50s -> 8538.52s]  Fine, follow the plan.
[8538.52s -> 8539.52s]  I am a squire.
[8539.52s -> 8542.93s]  That's what I'm supposed to do.
[8542.93s -> 8545.19s]  Ah, good boy.
[8545.19s -> 8547.27s]  Get you a nice apple once I'm inside.
[8547.27s -> 8548.91s]  How does that sound?
[8548.91s -> 8555.52s]  Yeah, that sounds good.
[8555.52s -> 8562.22s]  Am I a horse, Theo?
[8562.22s -> 8566.43s]  Have I been a horse this whole time?
[8566.43s -> 8568.87s]  And that's why he's trying to get me to go back
[8568.87s -> 8571.15s]  and take a different route and get away and go that way.
[8571.15s -> 8595.88s]  And I think you know the answers to that,
[8595.88s -> 8597.00s]  Sir Theo smiles.
[8597.00s -> 8597.96s]  You nod slowly.
[8597.96s -> 8604.56s]  Yes, yes I am.
[8604.56s -> 8622.77s]  I'll see you when you get out.
[8622.77s -> 8624.13s]  I'll see you when you get out.
[8624.13s -> 8626.17s]  I'll see you when I get out, he smiles.
[8626.17s -> 8628.23s]  He turns and walks through the mountains.
[8628.23s -> 8640.10s]  You set off along the road to find Captain Brannock's men.
[8640.10s -> 8643.16s]  You, what's a horse do?
[8643.16s -> 8646.55s]  Throttle, trottle, gallop.
[8646.55s -> 8648.64s]  You trottle, trottle.
[8648.64s -> 8655.42s]  What would it be?
[8655.42s -> 8660.15s]  Trot along the mountain's edge.
[8660.15s -> 8664.23s]  Barely being able to stand
[8664.27s -> 8680.84s]  on, barely being able, barely able to balance.
[8680.84s -> 8683.54s]  You set off along the road to find Captain Brannock's men.
[8683.54s -> 8685.54s]  You trot along the mountain's edge.
[8685.54s -> 8688.81s]  Heading north for nearly a mile before you find the men.
[8688.81s -> 8691.73s]  They're camped in a gap between two large rocks
[8691.73s -> 8693.30s]  just off the road.
[8693.30s -> 8700.57s]  You walk into the camp and find a fire burning cheerfully.
[8700.57s -> 8709.18s]  Gallop over a mile.
[8709.18s -> 8715.22s]  How big was that mountain?
[8715.22s -> 8719.34s]  You walk slowly over to the men.
[8719.34s -> 8721.74s]  Clicking on the stones, your hooves.
[8721.74s -> 8724.02s]  You approach the fire and stand by it.
[8724.02s -> 8728.16s]  One of the men notices you and approaches.
[8728.16s -> 8736.05s]  Oh, hello there.
[8736.05s -> 8753.67s]  Is Captain Brannock around?
[8753.67s -> 8755.14s]  Horses don't talk.
[8755.14s -> 8756.14s]  This one does apparently
[8756.14s -> 8761.22s]  because Theo can understand everything I'm saying.
[8761.22s -> 8762.53s]  He's over there.
[8762.53s -> 8763.79s]  The guard says pointing over
[8763.79s -> 8774.12s]  to where a larger fire is burning.
[8774.12s -> 8777.27s]  You want me to take your horse to the stable?
[8777.27s -> 8778.11s]  Yes, please.
[8778.11s -> 8782.77s]  From a horse riding on top of a horse.
[8782.77s -> 8787.88s]  Interesting.
[8787.88s -> 8789.15s]  Oh, okay.
[8789.15s -> 8791.15s]  And I love how the larger fire,
[8791.15s -> 8795.93s]  there's one fire and then a larger fire right there.
[8795.93s -> 8803.98s]  Go to the larger fire.
[8803.98s -> 8812.68s]  Horse kick somebody, I will.
[8812.68s -> 8815.00s]  You walk over to the larger fire and stand by it.
[8815.00s -> 8816.52s]  The warmth feels nice on your back
[8816.52s -> 8818.40s]  after a long ride in the cold.
[8818.40s -> 8819.92s]  One of the men notices you.
[8819.92s -> 8831.61s]  Oh, hello there.
[8831.61s -> 8834.28s]  Theo is a mile long.
[8834.28s -> 8837.52s]  Long one mile.
[8837.52s -> 8840.86s]  You horse kick him into the fire.
[8840.86s -> 8842.00s]  You lash out at the man,
[8842.00s -> 8843.58s]  your hoof flying into his chest
[8843.58s -> 8845.30s]  and knocking him into the fire.
[8845.30s -> 8847.84s]  His screams are soon replaced by the sizzle of flesh
[8847.84s -> 8856.11s]  and the smell of roasting human quickly fills the cave.
[8856.11s -> 8859.21s]  Go to Captain Ren.
[8859.21s -> 8863.44s]  Rannick?
[8863.44s -> 8871.04s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[8871.04s -> 8873.20s]  Where's Rannick?
[8873.20s -> 8885.22s]  Right.
[8885.22s -> 8886.98s]  The other guards stand drawing their weapons.
[8886.98s -> 8889.22s]  They advance on you, but you're not backing down.
[8889.22s -> 8893.38s]  You swing a hoof and knock a man's arm into his chest,
[8893.38s -> 8896.09s]  breaking it.
[8896.09s -> 8908.65s]  Where is Rannick?
[8908.65s -> 8910.37s]  Breaking, yeah, breaking his,
[8910.37s -> 8915.79s]  I think it breaks his arm and stuffs it into his chest.
[8915.79s -> 8916.75s]  The men begin to surround you,
[8916.75s -> 8918.95s]  keeping out of the reach of your hooves.
[8918.95s -> 8920.47s]  One of them speaks up.
[8920.47s -> 8927.68s]  Captain Rannick, we have intruders.
[8927.68s -> 8933.86s]  Captain Rannick slowly walks his way towards group.
[8942.54s -> 8946.02s]  Next quest, help Sir Theo complete his quest.
[8946.02s -> 8949.89s]  Oh, whatever, okay.
[8949.89s -> 8951.37s]  Captain Rannick slowly walks his way
[8951.37s -> 8953.66s]  towards the group smiling.
[8953.66s -> 8955.06s]  Come on, lads.
[8955.06s -> 8957.16s]  We can take this one.
[8957.16s -> 8961.47s]  One of the men says charging at you.
[8961.47s -> 8966.96s]  Force kick him into a large group of people
[8968.22s -> 8973.06s]  that all have to catch you together
[8973.06s -> 8976.70s]  at least seven to eight people
[8976.70s -> 8981.70s]  who then all fall down at the same time.
[8988.89s -> 8991.35s]  Somebody gets it, good.
[8991.35s -> 8999.04s]  As long as one of you gets it, that's all I care about.
[8999.04s -> 9008.42s]  Force kick him into the crowd.
[9008.42s -> 9010.54s]  You swing a hoof, knocking the man back into the crowd.
[9010.54s -> 9012.82s]  He screams as he's tripled
[9013.38s -> 9018.96s]  and you nick another man's neck with your hoof.
[9018.96s -> 9036.06s]  I want answers, Rannick.
[9036.06s -> 9039.16s]  And you shan't receive them.
[9039.16s -> 9042.12s]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, continue.
[9042.12s -> 9055.00s]  One of the men jumps towards you swinging his sword.
[9055.00s -> 9059.48s]  Force kick him in the head.
[9059.48s -> 9060.80s]  You swing a powerful hoof,
[9060.80s -> 9063.00s]  knocking the man's head clean off.
[9063.00s -> 9066.19s]  It rolls to Captain Rannick's feet.
[9066.19s -> 9071.74s]  Oh dear me, he says stepping back.
[9071.74s -> 9076.32s]  Tell me everything you know.
[9076.32s -> 9079.24s]  Tell me everything you know.
[9079.24s -> 9089.52s]  You charge, knocking a guard off his feet
[9089.52s -> 9091.13s]  and trampling him.
[9091.13s -> 9094.72s]  All right, all right, please no more.
[9094.72s -> 9100.50s]  Stop and look at him expectantly.
[9100.50s -> 9114.21s]  What do you know?
[9114.21s -> 9117.53s]  It's a secret passage right behind you.
[9117.53s -> 9122.35s]  They use it to spy on us, I don't know why.
[9122.35s -> 9132.61s]  What do you mean?

[9411.49s -> 9417.16s]  You just keep walking into the night after an hour or two of walking you come across an old wooden cabin
[9417.16s -> 9437.47s]  You walk up to it still carrying Brannock, you know this place. Yes
[9437.47s -> 9443.21s]  I do Brannock says inching closer to you for warmth. This is my cabin
[9443.21s -> 9448.41s]  I use it for hunting you step forward walking into the cabin
[9448.57s -> 9468.94s]  Heavens do you own how many cabins do you own? Just this one?
[9469.30s -> 9474.32s]  Brannock says I was saving to buy a larger one with a fireplace and a wood stove
[9474.40s -> 9489.57s]  But I think I need a new hunting knife instead your hunter Brannock what animals did you hunt you know?
[9489.57s -> 9491.57s]  I'm just I'm just a little fucking curious about that
[9501.18s -> 9506.39s]  Mostly dear Brannock says I also tracked and killed a few wolves
[9506.99s -> 9518.00s]  Bandits and other criminals did you really oh yes kill a horse
[9518.44s -> 9551.58s]  Yes, Brannock says give me the reason why say give me the reason why they hurt my mommy's
[9551.98s -> 9558.60s]  You've roar lashing out at him Brannock falls off of you and you bring your
[9595.57s -> 9606.04s]  Mommy's
[9606.04s -> 9617.69s]  Hmm, okay, you roar. Oh, oh god. Oh god. What have I done?

[9636.14s -> 9639.08s]  You say oh god. What have I done?
[9639.88s -> 9642.76s]  You stare at Brannock's crushed skull
[9643.40s -> 9660.02s]  Horrified by what you did you had to Brannock's ghost appears behind you we had to I'm sorry
[9660.02s -> 9679.83s]  I just got so angry. I'm sorry. I just got so angry. I know
[9680.47s -> 9685.00s]  The ghost of Brannock says but now you must continue your journey
[9685.72s -> 9688.02s]  There are more like us up ahead
[9688.06s -> 9709.88s]  We need you to kill them kill them only a true king can kill another king
[9709.88s -> 9716.86s]  You must ascend the throne and kill the other kings Brannock says urgently
[9717.50s -> 9720.10s]  Only then can you be the one?
[9720.82s -> 9737.12s]  True king I am a horse though, but I am a horse a horse
[9738.00s -> 9759.93s]  Never be king, but I'm a horse a horse can never be king. You're not just any horse
[9760.53s -> 9768.73s]  Brannock says you're the horse that will raise up kill the king and become king yourself
[9774.40s -> 9777.98s]  Legally binding now it works
[9777.98s -> 9793.54s]  What if the king gets bit by a poisonous squirrel is a poisonous squirrel become the king of the world is that legally binding?
[9793.58s -> 9800.41s]  No, Brannock says Brannock's ghost fades away, and you turn to walk out of the cabin your adventure is over
[9800.41s -> 9811.48s]  No, no, no, we're no no we're going back. You're the horse that would raise up kill the king and become the king
[9811.48s -> 9831.89s]  I accept the challenge good. Yeah, Brannock says he reaches out placing a hand on your shoulder

[10222.80s -> 10235.78s]  That's the true ending. Let's do another one. I mean, this is we're gonna try to get something weird
[10236.38s -> 10243.39s]  Back hold on. Let's do let's make the randomness. I can sing wait eternal darkness
[10244.07s -> 10245.75s]  Yeah

[10271.68s -> 10273.68s]  cyberpunk
[10276.24s -> 10282.56s]  Do it I told you the scenario was gonna play out where I was gonna want to do this here. All right. Here's my problem
[10283.24s -> 10285.08s]  my problem with doing
[10285.08s -> 10291.60s]  Her doctors now is cuz I've been streaming for three hours. I'm probably only gonna be live for like another hour or two
[10292.36s -> 10294.12s]  typically, right
[10294.12s -> 10297.16s]  Starting that new game and only being gonna potentially play it for an hour
[10297.68s -> 10306.22s]  I'd rather get that in there and do that for like five or six hours with a diary of a wimpy kid prompt
[10306.50s -> 10314.25s]  Don't worry there. There will be vengeance for the eternal darkness voters
[10314.25s -> 10320.90s]  I promise that will be the next video game that we play. That's the next game
[10320.90s -> 10323.58s]  We're going to play on this stream is eternal darkness
[10326.34s -> 10342.04s]  Sanity, whatever it is. That's the next game guys ready custom. Let's do something weird like you are
[10342.80s -> 10355.06s]  currently running from a tornado of a
[10356.40s -> 10361.34s]  shotgun and a pair of jeans and
[10369.15s -> 10372.39s]  Now you have a shotgun and a pair of sunglasses
[10373.79s -> 10386.71s]  You need to warn the city about the incoming
[10388.18s -> 10389.26s]  disaster
[10389.26s -> 10402.34s]  There the tornado is coming. You just need to get out of here
[10402.34s -> 10410.17s]  The wind is picking up and it'll be too late soon in drive
[10410.21s -> 10422.03s]  I'm not gonna shoot the tornado you look at the tornado and realize that it can't possibly hit the city
[10422.21s -> 10424.73s]  It's not going to make it past the levees
[10425.13s -> 10436.42s]  You're going to have to do something else go home. I was wrong. I had it wrong
[10436.82s -> 10447.46s]  Go home you race back to your house the entire way you think about what could have caused this
[10447.90s -> 10453.83s]  You come up with several theories including global warming or the government and yeah
[10453.83s -> 10456.83s]  I mean it's probably if the tornado started and just stopped randomly
[10456.83s -> 10458.83s]  I'd be like what the fuck is happening with our planet?
[10459.19s -> 10475.82s]  Let it play out one more time when you arrive at the house
[10475.82s -> 10480.62s]  You slam the car in the garage and head into the basement you sit in your home and begin watching TV
[10480.62s -> 10482.06s]  This is the Simpsons
[10482.06s -> 10484.94s]  They pulled that from the Simpsons
[10485.18s -> 10506.41s]  Okay, where's Marge turn on the news the news begins to talk about a brutal killing in Bel-Nor
[10506.69s -> 10510.75s]  You quickly change the station and switch to channel 45 the Hinsky News Network
[10544.47s -> 10547.21s]  Okay, James you drink out of your duff beer can
[10547.67s -> 10551.59s]  You go to the fridge and find a beer the news begins to talk about a brutal killing in Bel-Nor

[10555.89s -> 10561.63s]  Watch the news. What does Homer do?
[10565.97s -> 10573.03s]  You watch the news the news is showing a clip of you exiting Marge's bedroom this morning when the news was called
[10573.75s -> 10596.57s]  How do you do it? It's like no you say no
[10597.37s -> 10601.89s]  Realizing that you had been caught on tape you attempt to turn off the TV, but you notice something else
[10601.89s -> 10603.89s]  You appear to be live on the news
[10604.01s -> 10617.30s]  Hey, how did you get me on? How did you get me on the TV?
[10618.10s -> 10631.94s]  You look out the window and realize you have been surrounded by TV crews
[10631.94s -> 10642.64s]  You see a large boom being lowered from a helicopter towards your house Marge get down here
[10642.88s -> 10653.79s]  Why would they bring a huge boom mic you call for Marge?
[10653.79s -> 10656.91s]  She comes downstairs the boom stops outside your window
[10657.51s -> 10670.82s]  scream into the mic scream into the mic as
[10671.94s -> 10673.92s]  loud as
[10673.92s -> 10683.92s]  You can you look out the window and Marge appears
[10683.96s -> 10687.96s]  She screams into the microphone the boom retracts into the helicopter which flies away
[10688.40s -> 10704.72s]  Marge has saved the day once again that's an area where he would do that
[10705.00s -> 10714.49s]  You say don't again and realizing that you had been caught on tape a second time you turn off the TV you go to the
[10714.49s -> 10716.49s]  Window you realize that you're still being watched

[10798.79s -> 10805.79s]  You watch as the Bellnore fire department carries out all the furniture from your house Ned approaches you

[11725.78s -> 11734.84s]  I just created a hundred more of them. Wait, there's a dragon
[11735.36s -> 11740.93s]  Mighty roar is heard you feel as though the very ground you're standing on is shaking
[11741.25s -> 11744.53s]  You see a massive winged beast flying above the clouds. It's headed your way
[11745.13s -> 11749.23s]  face the beast
[11749.59s -> 11751.39s]  in my truck
[11751.39s -> 11767.47s]  Try to keep it in sight, but to no avail it disappears from your view. It's still shaking the ground
[11768.19s -> 11775.71s]  use binoculars
[11775.71s -> 11786.69s]  We use binoculars to see the beast. The beast is huge. It's much larger than an airplane
[11786.77s -> 11789.29s]  What's more amazing is that it is clearly flying?
[11790.09s -> 11798.92s]  follow the beast
[11799.08s -> 11804.72s]  do with the shotgun from like a
[11805.96s -> 11807.96s]  15,000 feet below where he is
[11808.08s -> 11813.61s]  You continue to follow the beast keeping your eyes on it. It looks as if it's heading right towards you
[11813.61s -> 11822.68s]  It lets out another roar thrive down the beasts throat
[11823.28s -> 11841.66s]  It's that movie Bill Murray that it has like a cold and they get in there
[11843.17s -> 11848.46s]  It's like Punxsutawney Phil. What's it called? It's about the guy the
[11850.49s -> 11855.93s]  Osmosis Jones, that's what it is. I'm gonna Osmosis Jones this motherfucker right now
[11856.51s -> 11858.51s]  You see the beasts insides
[11858.95s -> 11866.81s]  Everything is redness and carnage. You manage to make out a road running along the beasts throat drive down the road
[11867.41s -> 11880.40s]  Yep, drive down the road after driving down the beast throat for quite some time
[11880.64s -> 11888.00s]  You reach a beaver that is holding a sign in front of it that reads next services heartburn hotel next left
[11893.31s -> 11894.83s]  Heartburn Hotel
[11894.83s -> 11901.62s]  All right, go to the heartburn. I'm gonna go to the heartburn hotel and just like put a bunch of hot peppers
[11901.96s -> 11905.56s]  Into like the wood stove that they have and he's gonna get really gassy and he's gonna be like
[11906.64s -> 11928.85s]  Next services go to the heartburn hotel the beaver waves at you as you pull into the hotel parking lot
[11928.85s -> 11936.16s]  He holds a sign in front of him that reads hotel lobby this way go to the hotel lobby
[11936.84s -> 11939.92s]  He's gonna be the clerk at he's gonna be the person at registration
[11940.42s -> 11950.68s]  Go to the hotel lobby you walk into the hotel lobby a man dressed in a fancy tuxedo stands behind a counter
[11950.68s -> 11959.54s]  He smiles at you ask to be
[11960.30s -> 11962.51s]  brought to
[11962.51s -> 11963.87s]  the
[11963.87s -> 11965.07s]  Oh

[11976.78s -> 11980.88s]  I want to like because this is like his heartburn. We're gonna make it worse. So he pukes us out
[11981.06s -> 11999.23s]  Yeah, we're gonna go in there be like hey something's wrong with your basement the heater
[11999.23s -> 12011.00s]  I gotta go down there and take a look at it the plot to a monkey island game
[12011.72s -> 12019.26s]  It is are you asked to be brought to the basement to see the heater. You're pretending to be a repairman
[12019.76s -> 12023.20s]  Your thing sir. Just take the elevator to your right
[12023.52s -> 12027.28s]  Let me get the keys to room 2 2 1 where the basement is located. Oh
[12029.64s -> 12031.16s]  That would not be a basement
[12031.72s -> 12051.40s]  Go to room go to room 2 2 1 the man hands you the keys to room 2 2 1 you thank him and
[12051.60s -> 12056.91s]  Walk towards the elevator you get in the elevator and press B or basement
[12057.11s -> 12071.60s]  There's B. Let's see what happens you exit the elevator and find yourself in a hallway
[12072.12s -> 12081.51s]  Heartburn hotel basement where service is still the most important thing in the world. The hallway is made of cement ask
[12082.03s -> 12085.47s]  Ask the clerk
[12085.75s -> 12088.31s]  He's shown
[12089.29s -> 12101.13s]  Heater ask the clerk to show you where the heater is there you go
[12101.45s -> 12114.17s]  You asked the clerk to show you where the heater is certainly follow me. He stands up and walked down the hallway
[12114.17s -> 12121.80s]  He stops in front of room 2 2 1 a this is it go into 2 2 1 a
[12122.72s -> 12135.35s]  Game has probably forgotten that we're in a dragon probably
[12135.79s -> 12141.91s]  Okay, you go to 2 2 1 a you walk into the boiler room. It's fairly large with two large boilers in the center
[12142.91s -> 12147.35s]  so what we just break them so we give him indigestion and he gets like we make the
[12147.97s -> 12152.33s]  Heating elements spill out into the hotel, which is that's his stomach or whatever and then he gets sick
[12152.93s -> 12154.49s]  We're gonna smash him
[12154.49s -> 12158.72s]  Burn up. Okay, turn the heat up turn the heat up
[12160.27s -> 12161.75s]  It's
[12161.75s -> 12171.43s]  Maximum turn the heat up to max turn the heat up to maximum turn the heat up to maximum heat
[12171.87s -> 12183.54s]  Turn the heat up to maximum heat the boilers begin to hiss as they begin to output more heat
[12183.86s -> 12186.74s]  You exit the boiler room and head back to the hotel lobby
[12187.10s -> 12203.08s]  Come on the clerk at the front desk looks up at you and smiles all fixed. He asks
[12203.26s -> 12212.00s]  Yeah, sorry about that. You walk out of the hotel back into your truck you drive away
[12212.88s -> 12218.70s]  See in the rear view mirror
[12221.91s -> 12223.15s]  Hava
[12223.15s -> 12226.13s]  pouring out of the windows
[12227.03s -> 12243.36s]  No, no, not that either all fixed. Yeah all fixed
[12243.36s -> 12250.32s]  I feel like this is at the point of the movie where in this music too
[12251.67s -> 12257.95s]  I have the thing that I needed to take out of the hotel in my hand and I'm putting it behind my back and it's a
[12257.95s -> 12262.03s]  Big jacket and stuff and it's like a comedy routine where like I'm really trying to not have them see what I have
[12262.43s -> 12266.87s]  They have no idea and they're just like I'll have a good day and I think that they're like really suspicious
[12266.87s -> 12284.14s]  But they're just not how do I write that? Oh, yeah, this is Dragonair
[12284.82s -> 12289.24s]  do a comedy scene
[12289.64s -> 12294.96s]  drive
[12294.96s -> 12296.96s]  towards the dragons
[12297.80s -> 12303.40s]  Throat because then with a heartburn hotel, let's drive towards the throat
[12303.92s -> 12314.16s]  Drive towards the dragon's throat. The dragon's throat is still dark, but not as dark as it was earlier
[12314.16s -> 12320.17s]  You can see a red glow coming from deep within I guess can continue
[12321.32s -> 12322.28s]  forward
[12322.28s -> 12335.13s]  Through the dragon's digestive system. Are you showing me open it?
[12335.13s -> 12338.01s]  I'm what you can't just make somebody open a present
[12338.01s -> 12346.96s]  You don't sit down and stuff a present in my face and go open it now
[12347.24s -> 12360.45s]  No, I don't want I don't know what's in that fucking present the way this is oh, okay, that's what that is
[12360.97s -> 12368.87s]  This is me smashing ps2 the board game
[12369.47s -> 12377.82s]  Joe scooby-doo. What do you have a scooby-doo? Ah
[12382.40s -> 12401.44s]  Wait this I clicked on the wrong one. This is is this even my face. This is my eyes and mouth on scooby-doo
[12401.44s -> 12409.51s]  I mean, I guess it kind of works. I feel like my mouth looks like that sometimes
[12410.03s -> 12419.21s]  Okay, let's keep going continue forward through the dragon's digestive system
[12419.25s -> 12428.80s]  You can take forward through the dragon's digestive system
[12428.80s -> 12434.52s]  You travel through the darkness not knowing what is in store you drive past rows and rows of teeth all shapes and sizes
[12434.52s -> 12442.98s]  This is a long trip. We've been on this road for a very long time. Oh
[12446.45s -> 12456.42s]  Down the dragon's throat into his stomach. I suppose stomach
[12456.42s -> 12469.63s]  I want to get in there drive deep into the dragon's stomach. There we go. All right, we're in this tree
[12469.63s -> 12470.71s]  Now we're in the dragon's stomach
[12470.71s -> 12479.54s]  There's a quite a large chamber you park your truck next to a rather large mound of half digested cows
[12479.78s -> 12506.49s]  You exit your vehicle and look around the chamber walls. Maybe somebody's alive down here. Is anyone here you shout into the darkness
[12506.49s -> 12508.29s]  Is anyone here?
[12508.29s -> 12523.65s]  Suddenly a large section of the chamber wall begins to move it reveals a tunnel which continues further down into the darkness back in my truck
[12524.13s -> 12538.30s]  Get back in your truck. You quickly run back into your truck and drive down the tunnel
[12538.54s -> 12545.65s]  The tunnel is long and twisty. You hope you can remember how to get back in you forward
[12545.97s -> 12561.15s]  All begins to slope downward and you can feel a change in air pressure you reach the end of the tunnel which opens up
[12561.15s -> 12562.79s]  into a large chamber
[12562.79s -> 12565.61s]  Drive out of the chamber
[12565.73s -> 12580.35s]  You drive out of the chamber you pull out of the tunnel and into the large chamber
[12580.35s -> 12584.19s]  You can see lights up ahead somebody must be here. You put your truck in park and get out
[12586.99s -> 12588.91s]  investigate the lights
[12588.91s -> 12602.19s]  Walk towards the lights as you approach them. You see a large rectangular opening in the ground
[12602.59s -> 12605.55s]  Ropes harnesses and other climbing equipment is lying around
[12610.96s -> 12616.90s]  Interesting you have found a climbing camp
[12617.46s -> 12621.78s]  Suddenly you hear the roar of a dragon. The sound is very close and very loud
[12622.50s -> 12624.74s]  You look up just in time to see a large dragon
[12625.54s -> 12626.50s]  but
[12626.50s -> 12630.91s]  Flying in your direction
[12630.91s -> 12639.39s]  Huh, but he's flying at me backwards with his ass
[12648.29s -> 12649.90s]  Ah
[12649.90s -> 12655.14s]  Okay, so what happened?
[12655.14s -> 12660.74s]  What happened wait back it up? Okay, do I run?
[12664.61s -> 12666.61s]  Get back in the truck
[12666.93s -> 12691.60s]  You dive back into your truck the dragon butt misses you by mere inches and instead crashes through the windshield of your truck
[12692.00s -> 12706.75s]  The tail continues on and crashes through the back window. Can you driving? I can see i'll be fine
[12707.07s -> 12717.90s]  I can just lean out the window like jim carrey hit the gas pedal and try to drive away
[12717.90s -> 12724.14s]  But the dragon butt is lodged firmly in your truck. You back up a little to dislodge it, but it's no use
[12724.62s -> 12744.50s]  The ass is too big. What the fuck what the hell? What the hell are you doing in my tent?
[12744.66s -> 12768.21s]  Damn it. Get the hell out. I'm sorry. Who are you say? I'm sorry. Who are you?
[12769.86s -> 12772.74s]  Oh, it's fucked up back it up

[12793.60s -> 12802.67s]  You rip down the tent you pull the ropes ripping the entire tent down your anger is out of control
[12803.55s -> 12812.10s]  The other climber wakes up and looks around in shock. How do I get out of here?
[12812.66s -> 12830.54s]  How do I get out of here? Wait, who are you? What are you doing in my tent?
[12831.70s -> 12833.70s]  I asked the question
[12833.78s -> 12848.00s]  Hey, you're that guy that was driving down the road. What are you doing here?
[12848.56s -> 12851.18s]  I got eaten
[12851.18s -> 12853.62s]  by the dragon
[12853.62s -> 12854.74s]  stupid
[12854.74s -> 12868.18s]  I gotta be mean to this guy
[12868.18s -> 12872.99s]  On purpose. I mean was it on purpose or was it the last ditch effort thing that I could do?
[12873.79s -> 12877.47s]  He's coming straight at me opens his mouth. What am I gonna do not just drive down his throat?
[12877.87s -> 12889.20s]  Gotta word that better. What are you doing here? The dragon ate me
[12890.67s -> 12892.67s]  I had the dragon eat me on purpose
[12908.03s -> 12910.03s]  You did what are you insane?
[12911.94s -> 12913.54s]  Maybe a little
[12913.54s -> 12925.02s]  You in?
[12925.02s -> 12930.54s]  Hell, yes, i'm in those treasure hunters are cold-blooded killers. There's no way i'm going back to that camp
[12931.18s -> 12934.80s]  What's your name?
[12934.80s -> 12948.70s]  How many people are actually in this dragon? I'm perney perney the climber
[12949.26s -> 12952.94s]  I was hired by the treasure hunters to rope down and examine the structure of the ruins
[12956.19s -> 12961.49s]  Do you know you are inside of a dragon's?
[12962.37s -> 12965.73s]  ass
[12965.73s -> 12967.73s]  I I don't he might not know
[12980.14s -> 12984.21s]  Ernie stares at you in disbelief. You've got to be kidding me
[12985.34s -> 12986.54s]  Not kidding
[12986.54s -> 12998.67s]  Ernie looks around nervously
[12998.67s -> 13000.91s]  How the hell did we end up inside a dragon?
[13001.79s -> 13005.23s]  I knew those treasure hunter guys were crazy. They always go looking for dragons
[13005.87s -> 13018.78s]  Have any supplies?
[13018.78s -> 13023.98s]  Sadly, no, they only supplied me with the bare minimum and they took the rest of my gear before throwing me in here
[13028.34s -> 13030.34s]  Do you have a sled?
[13030.96s -> 13032.40s]  Can you
[13032.40s -> 13034.40s]  Make me a sled
[13040.62s -> 13043.42s]  The car is destroyed remember reverse butt dragon
[13044.06s -> 13048.29s]  Killed to crush the car
[13048.29s -> 13050.75s]  Can you make me a sled?
[13050.75s -> 13052.99s]  a sled why
[13053.07s -> 13055.07s]  So I can ride the dragon
[13055.41s -> 13057.73s]  Ernie rushes up to you and takes you by the shoulders
[13062.03s -> 13070.10s]  And what does he do?
[13070.10s -> 13074.78s]  Ernie rushes up and takes you by the shoulders. She stares deep into your eyes
[13076.46s -> 13078.46s]  Look, i'm going to be completely honest with you
[13079.58s -> 13092.08s]  There is no way you are riding this dragon. Why not? Why i'm curious
[13092.40s -> 13098.96s]  It's the only chance either of us have of getting out of here alive
[13100.46s -> 13103.66s]  You're not a dragon rider. I can tell just by looking at you
[13106.66s -> 13107.86s]  I think
[13107.86s -> 13110.80s]  We can
[13110.88s -> 13112.96s]  Oh not
[13112.96s -> 13115.36s]  You don't
[13115.36s -> 13125.17s]  I'll prove it to you another NPC. Yeah another NPC
[13125.89s -> 13136.85s]  I'll prove it to you
[13136.85s -> 13141.90s]  That's not accurate. This is this is not what I like at like the county fair
[13147.84s -> 13150.78s]  Okay, that's a little better. How about this one?
[13150.94s -> 13152.78s]  It's the exact same song
[13152.78s -> 13154.06s]  How did I do that?
[13154.06s -> 13155.18s]  Here we go
[13155.18s -> 13160.27s]  Ernie grabs your shoulders and looks deep into your eyes. She begins to speak
[13160.83s -> 13171.46s]  I'm going to ask you a series of questions
[13171.86s -> 13174.10s]  And I want you to answer them as quickly as you can
[13174.90s -> 13178.11s]  Ready? Have you ever ridden a dragon before?
[13179.84s -> 13183.87s]  No, I mean
[13183.95s -> 13193.26s]  Yes
[13193.26s -> 13201.36s]  Never never Ernie frowns and lets go of you. Is that going to

[13215.18s -> 13216.88s]  Not necessarily
[13216.88s -> 13218.72s]  Just answer the next question
[13218.72s -> 13220.72s]  What did you do before you rode a dragon?
[13223.65s -> 13227.49s]  Uh, I think he was doing a simpsons thing
[13228.05s -> 13233.38s]  And then I turned into being inside of a dragon. I don't know what were a new a nuclear
[13233.86s -> 13242.53s]  Worker, what did you do before you rode a dragon drove down its throat?
[13243.17s -> 13259.62s]  I drove down a dragon's throat. Ernie throws her hands into the air
[13270.54s -> 13278.59s]  Hi birds. Oh, she's stuck. She's stuck. She can't move
[13284.42s -> 13286.43s]  Uh-oh, come on
[13286.43s -> 13293.44s]  Give us something. Come on. Do it. It's thinking so hard
[13295.62s -> 13312.88s]  Okay, i'll do it too. Ernie throws her hands into the air. You throw your hands into the air
[13313.20s -> 13315.20s]  Ernie looks at you with a look of disbelief
[13315.20s -> 13319.50s]  This is hopeless if you can't even tell me when i'm joking and when i'm not
[13320.86s -> 13324.30s]  Wait, if you can't tell when i'm joking when I so this has been like a just a
[13324.70s -> 13346.83s]  Ha, I know you're a dragon rider. I'm just kidding. I knew it was a joke. Why didn't you know I was joking?
[13352.56s -> 13356.08s]  You say ha ha ha ha ha ha Ernie frowns at you. I'm not laughing
[13356.72s -> 13364.30s]  She turns away from you and stares at the walls of the dragon's stomach. You know
[13365.47s -> 13367.47s]  How to get out of here?
[13374.14s -> 13380.90s]  Being gaslit by an npc something like that Ernie looks at you and raises an eyebrow
[13381.98s -> 13383.50s]  Of course I do
[13383.50s -> 13395.73s]  And let's go
[13395.73s -> 13406.93s]  Not so fast. I want your word that you will take me with you when we get out of here have my word
[13409.79s -> 13411.31s]  She's so fucked
[13411.31s -> 13421.15s]  Good enough Ernie turns away from you and begins scanning the walls for a way out
[13421.71s -> 13423.71s]  She looks up at one of the holes in the ceiling
[13424.27s -> 13437.65s]  Is that big enough?
[13437.65s -> 13441.95s]  Maybe begins looking around for something to stand on. What are you doing?
[13442.59s -> 13444.69s]  Looking for something to stand on
[13444.69s -> 13459.14s]  Why so why can't get up there? You're not strong enough to pull yourself up there. I'll figure out a way
[13459.62s -> 13487.04s]  She looks around some more. I can't believe you can't tell what i'm joking Ernie turns to you surprised
[13487.81s -> 13489.81s]  I thought you said you wouldn't make any more jokes
[13494.94s -> 13509.70s]  All I know how to do Ernie. I'm sorry. Can you take anything seriously?
[13509.86s -> 13519.34s]  I'm trying to Ernie smiles at you then turns away. What is the lead?
[13528.74s -> 13540.56s]  Ernie looks up at the hole of the ceiling surface. I hope is there any way of telling climb?
[13544.77s -> 13550.05s]  Uh climb on climb the truck, right? We can move we can I can we put it in neutral climb the truck
[13551.01s -> 13553.01s]  and get into
[13553.01s -> 13566.22s]  the hole
[13566.22s -> 13567.98s]  Climb the truck and get into the hole
[13567.98s -> 13572.62s]  You crawl out of the dragon's mouth and find yourself in the middle of a vast snow-covered plane. It's a beautiful day
[13574.86s -> 13584.50s]  Reckon you turn around and crawl back into the dragon's mouth
[13584.58s -> 13588.10s]  You climb down from the truck and stand up inside the dragon's belly
[13588.58s -> 13593.94s]  Trucks lies on the floor of the cavern clearly dead. No, not my truck trucks trucky the truck
[13594.50s -> 13602.13s]  I found
[13602.13s -> 13605.01s]  Away it leads it leads it leads
[13605.81s -> 13614.90s]  out of his mouth
[13614.90s -> 13616.42s]  I know that
[13616.42s -> 13619.70s]  His mouth is very small. I don't think it's meant for people to go in and out of
[13625.17s -> 13627.49s]  Any uh, any uh, any other ideas?
[13631.22s -> 13636.85s]  I just came in and out
[13636.85s -> 13641.30s]  None you begin to panic you sit down next to the corpse of the man who tried to help you
[13641.94s -> 13652.05s]  Well, I guess this is it then
[13652.05s -> 13655.79s]  Can't we go?
[13655.79s -> 13657.47s]  Another way
[13657.47s -> 13668.70s]  I've explored this entire continent. There's no other way
[13669.34s -> 13671.74s]  You slump to the ground staring at the hole in the wall
[13683.07s -> 13685.28s]  continent
[13685.28s -> 13686.16s]  Okay
[13686.16s -> 13688.08s]  climb through
[13688.08s -> 13690.40s]  the hole
[13690.40s -> 13704.38s]  with perney
[13704.38s -> 13719.23s]  And climb through the hole doesn't know what to do. Try it again. This stream is so fucked
[13721.46s -> 13722.34s]  uh
[13722.34s -> 13723.54s]  Thanks, man
[13723.54s -> 13729.14s]  Climb through the hole with perney you crawl out of the dragon's mouth and you find yourself in the middle of a vast snow-covered plane
[13729.14s -> 13738.51s]  It's a beautiful day
[13738.51s -> 13740.67s]  kick her back in just like
[13741.23s -> 13744.83s]  Sparta kick her back into the mouth. Why is the mouth just open?
[13745.39s -> 13750.24s]  No, I know what we can do
[13750.24s -> 13752.24s]  Take out a marker
[13753.47s -> 13755.71s]  and draw a funny mustache
[13757.62s -> 13777.54s]  on the dragon
[13777.54s -> 13780.42s]  You take out a marker and draw a funny mustache on the dragon
[13781.06s -> 13785.30s]  Trucks lies on the floor of the cavern clearly dead you pick him up and throw him down the hole
[13785.78s -> 13787.78s]  You hear him hit the ground a few seconds later
[13788.26s -> 13794.02s]  What are you doing here?
[13794.77s -> 13796.77s]  Draw a funny
[13797.17s -> 13798.90s]  Mustache
[13798.90s -> 13800.34s]  on the dragon
[13800.34s -> 13808.02s]  Here take this marker
[13808.58s -> 13828.51s]  Here take this marker and draw a funny mustache on the dragon perney takes the marker from your hand
[13829.55s -> 13832.19s]  You're very weird
[13832.19s -> 13837.23s]  Just do it. All right
[13837.23s -> 13848.40s]  Come on, just do it
[13848.40s -> 13851.12s]  Ernie shrugs him because drawing a mustache on the dragon
[13851.76s -> 13855.65s]  Two of you crawl through the tunnel for what seems like an eternity
[13862.13s -> 13863.90s]  Go buy
[13863.90s -> 13865.82s]  a funny hat
[13865.82s -> 13867.95s]  at the store
[13867.95s -> 13870.35s]  And put it on the dragon's head
[13871.15s -> 13883.36s]  Okay, why are we going back in?
[13883.36s -> 13887.20s]  Buy a funny hat at the store and put it on the dragon's head perney looks at you and begins to laugh
[13887.76s -> 13889.36s]  That's really funny
[13889.36s -> 13901.76s]  If you crawl through the tunnel for what seems like an eternity crawling
[13907.31s -> 13909.31s]  Blow up the tunnel
[13909.87s -> 13912.30s]  Okay, i'm gonna plant c4 on the ground
[13915.22s -> 13919.54s]  Crawl through the tunnel for what feels like an eternity soon. You find yourself out of the tunnel. You're standing on a sidewalk
[13920.18s -> 13938.64s]  You plant c4 in the tunnel you press a button on your watch and the entire tunnel explodes
[13939.12s -> 13941.12s]  You and perney are thrown across the room
[13941.52s -> 13943.52s]  Haha, that was great
[13943.60s -> 13947.95s]  Okay, leave the tunnel
[13948.51s -> 13963.22s]  You leave the tunnel you walk outside the building and begin walking down the road. Where are we?
[13963.86s -> 13965.86s]  I don't know. I've never been here before have you?
[13966.34s -> 13971.54s]  Yeah, I want to look for the dragon to see if he's see if I like
[13972.18s -> 13977.33s]  Blew him up. I never been here before have you i've never left my house
[13978.13s -> 13980.13s]  I guess it's new to both of us
[13980.29s -> 13983.01s]  You look around you're in a city surrounded by high-rise buildings
[13983.73s -> 13989.39s]  Where's the dragon?
[13989.39s -> 14002.70s]  We're not in springfield anymore
[14008.02s -> 14010.34s]  I think it's because it did you look right? Yes
[14011.22s -> 14013.30s]  You do look for the dragon not you look
[14015.62s -> 14018.90s]  Get out of here perney shrieks the two of you walk around the city marveling and everything around you
[14022.67s -> 14024.67s]  attempt to attach
[14024.97s -> 14027.82s]  yourself
[14027.82s -> 14029.82s]  to a building
[14029.98s -> 14031.74s]  with your hands
[14031.74s -> 14046.90s]  You attempt to attach yourself to a building with your hands you find yourself swinging through the air
[14047.54s -> 14051.14s]  After a few minutes of this you land on another building. I'm never doing that again
[14057.04s -> 14059.12s]  Go back down to perney
[14064.35s -> 14066.03s]  He's retired
[14066.03s -> 14070.32s]  Walk over to perney who is sitting on the street
[14070.88s -> 14072.78s]  What's going on?
[14072.78s -> 14075.10s]  Me legs hurt from walking around so much
[14085.18s -> 14085.98s]  and
[14085.98s -> 14091.92s]  It's so funny when the ai just doesn't know what else to do
[14092.72s -> 14095.86s]  It tries it's sitting there going fuck. All right
[14096.50s -> 14099.62s]  What am I pulling from here? What am I gonna do here?
[14100.42s -> 14103.14s]  It's got like trillions of days of content
[14103.70s -> 14107.73s]  Can we take a break?
[14107.73s -> 14109.63s]  Sure
[14109.63s -> 14111.90s]  Sit down next to perney
[14111.90s -> 14114.30s]  Do you know where we are? No, do you yeah?
[14116.53s -> 14118.21s]  We are in
[14118.21s -> 14122.02s]  metropolis
[14122.02s -> 14124.02s]  of the old
[14124.18s -> 14125.22s]  round
[14125.22s -> 14128.42s]  Dean, uh the we're in the metropolis of the old round

[14148.70s -> 14150.86s]  bad name
[14150.86s -> 14161.70s]  I was making it up on the spot to make perney think I knew anything. That's what the place is called by the way
[14173.82s -> 14175.50s]  Can you not read?
[14175.50s -> 14176.77s]  No
[14176.77s -> 14178.77s]  You look at perney. He's staring at his feet
[14179.58s -> 14181.02s]  I want to go home
[14181.02s -> 14191.57s]  Was it wait and just take the bus

[14217.09s -> 14219.09s]  I don't have any bitcoin. Here we go
[14219.33s -> 14225.89s]  To explore one of the alleys you see a merchant standing outside of his shop putting up a sign that says demons for sale
[14226.53s -> 14235.76s]  The merchant looks up at you and sees you go away. Can you steal a demon? What kinds?
[14236.32s -> 14238.32s]  What kinds of demons do you have?
[14241.15s -> 14243.87s]  Kind what kind of demons do you sell?

[16610.00s -> 16618.87s]  Go to the living room you watch a lot of tv

[16624.50s -> 16626.50s]  Not a clue. We should get some rest
[16630.68s -> 16634.32s]  Um, um, I have a dragon
[16635.27s -> 16645.04s]  outside
[16645.04s -> 16646.87s]  Begins to laugh
[16646.87s -> 16651.83s]  I'm just joking mom. She picks up a throw pillow from the couch and hits you with it
[16652.87s -> 16654.87s]  Oh, yeah, whatever sport

[16661.52s -> 16663.67s]  dragon
[16663.67s -> 16665.67s]  Is it right outside?
[16666.23s -> 16678.10s]  He chuckles i'll see you in the morning
[16681.88s -> 16683.56s]  Get the dragon
[16683.56s -> 16690.47s]  To come in the house
[16690.47s -> 16692.32s]  ds2 board gamer
[16692.32s -> 16695.12s]  No
[16695.12s -> 16697.12s]  You see you get the dragon to come in the house
[16697.44s -> 16702.56s]  You see a large lizard slithering through the grass towards the front door. You open it and it slinks in okay
[16705.88s -> 16706.92s]  Mom
[16706.92s -> 16709.52s]  Come look
[16709.52s -> 16711.12s]  At the dragon
[16711.12s -> 16724.10s]  But it's not it's a lizard
[16724.18s -> 16725.94s]  You say
[16725.94s -> 16729.12s]  Hey mom, come look at the dragon. She walks over and screams
[16729.84s -> 16731.52s]  It's a dragon
[16731.52s -> 16739.27s]  She runs into the kitchen. You hear the sound of her opening the freezer. What's in the freezer?
[16739.67s -> 16745.27s]  I hope she takes out a she comes back holding a tray of ice cubes. The dragon looks at her annoyed
[16745.91s -> 16750.15s]  She throws the ice cubes at the dragon which slides away on its belly to avoid them
[16750.79s -> 16758.60s]  There is some logic behind this
[16759.24s -> 16765.27s]  Because if the dragon is fire, you know, that's that's like the stupidest logic ever right?
[16765.43s -> 16772.40s]  But it's there kind of the ai is trying hey mom stop
[16780.92s -> 16784.64s]  Why we need to help the dragon? What's it gonna do eat us?
[16787.04s -> 16814.00s]  Tell the dragon to eat mom the dragon opens its mouth and roars your mother looks down dejected
[16814.76s -> 16829.11s]  I'll never be free. Will I i'm sorry mom it was
[16830.64s -> 16858.39s]  Just a joke a prank. Why am I such a shitty child? That's a really good question
[16858.63s -> 16866.48s]  Are you perny where the fuck is perny? She looks at you. I know I know it's okay
[16866.56s -> 16873.20s]  You'd never hurt me on purpose. So imagine a mother hugging her son the next morning
[16873.44s -> 16889.25s]  I've got to get away from like weird child and mom arc of this story
[16889.41s -> 16891.25s]  This one's been going on for like an hour
[16891.25s -> 16895.32s]  You look for mom you search the house, but she's nowhere to be found
[16895.32s -> 16910.79s]  The back door is wide open you walk outside and look around mom you look around but she's gone
[16911.03s -> 16913.03s]  You have no idea where she went
[16918.02s -> 16926.53s]  Ask the dragon ask the dragon where your mom is
[16927.09s -> 16941.08s]  You ask the dragon where your mom is the dragon looks at you confused and it shrugs and goes back to sleep
[16941.40s -> 16944.04s]  You stand there for a while waiting for it to do something
[16948.79s -> 16950.55s]  You eat my mother
[16950.55s -> 16961.56s]  The dragon looks at you annoyed
[16961.88s -> 16965.96s]  It opens his mouth and flame shoots out it burns your arm and you begin to feel faint
[16971.30s -> 16981.83s]  Did you eat her dragon says something in its strange language?
[16982.64s -> 16986.08s]  You see a flash of your house in the distance a woman stands in front of it screaming
[16986.40s -> 16998.16s]  You run towards it, but the dragon flies in front of you. It looks at you annoyed
[16998.64s -> 17004.20s]  You scream as the house is consumed by a ball of flame finally the pain stops
[17025.54s -> 17030.71s]  Raid the fridge and open a beer. It's pretty gross, but you manage to finish it
[17030.71s -> 17034.07s]  You go to sleep at the end. It's supposed to be like six
[17040.55s -> 17044.07s]  All right. I'm i'm out of here. I'm done. I can't do anymore
[17044.55s -> 17049.30s]  It's been almost five hours. I don't I don't think my brain can handle any more of this
[17049.94s -> 17057.30s]  That was a very long simpsons episode. Yes
[17061.22s -> 17062.98s]  Say epilogue
[17062.98s -> 17068.21s]  Fine. I'm just curious
[17070.68s -> 17073.36s]  My mommy's
[17073.44s -> 17076.40s]  My chest is killing me right now. Let me be honest because of that
[17077.12s -> 17079.36s]  It was two or three things today that seriously it was just
[17080.42s -> 17083.78s]  Um, I I hurt myself. I like broke my penis
[17085.40s -> 17088.60s]  And I swear to god i'm not trying to be like funny. This is not like a funny joke
[17088.68s -> 17091.64s]  I actually was in the bathroom laughing so hard while taking a piss
[17092.74s -> 17094.98s]  I like i've hurt myself today
[17096.05s -> 17106.53s]  Like it was I was laughing too hard going to the bathroom. I just kept going over and over and over again in my head
[17106.61s -> 17108.85s]  What was happening? It was the panther thing
[17119.43s -> 17121.43s]  Accidental self-inflicted. Okay
[17122.23s -> 17126.31s]  There is no epilogue
[17126.31s -> 17132.61s]  What a quote. Oh, okay
[17132.61s -> 17135.04s]  Yeah, I gotta eat something
[17135.04s -> 17138.76s]  And i'm gonna get going
[17138.76s -> 17140.76s]  Oh, that was a ton of fun though
[17141.09s -> 17142.45s]  It always is
[17142.45s -> 17145.72s]  And i'm glad that it's been a full five hours. I knew it was gonna happen
[17146.20s -> 17148.58s]  A new eternal darkness was just not gonna happen
[17149.14s -> 17158.77s]  Epilogue didn't work. So I will see you guys
[17159.81s -> 17161.81s]  On I have some doctor's stuff to do
[17162.37s -> 17164.61s]  Over these next couple of days
[17164.69s -> 17167.25s]  But you will see me again
[17167.25s -> 17168.85s]  on friday
[17168.85s -> 17171.14s]  See on friday
[17171.14s -> 17174.10s]  We're going to do
[17174.10s -> 17175.30s]  um
[17175.30s -> 17177.48s]  Eternal darkness
[17177.48s -> 17184.90s]  And then saturday is the dlc movie night and watch the playlist of a shitload of videos
[17185.54s -> 17189.62s]  We're trying to go through them. The mods are doing a very good job
[17190.26s -> 17193.76s]  But I will say this again because I have to say this every time
[17194.76s -> 17198.22s]  There were hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of submissions
[17198.86s -> 17202.12s]  If you do not see your video
[17202.12s -> 17204.15s]  I'm, very sorry
[17204.15s -> 17206.23s]  But when you have this many submissions
[17207.90s -> 17210.78s]  We gotta try we gotta try to condense it a little
[17211.58s -> 17218.78s]  Even if I do this over the course of two or three days, it's possibly even thousands of them. Yeah
[17220.36s -> 17221.96s]  Too many people
[17221.96s -> 17224.65s]  Are funny
[17224.65s -> 17226.65s]  And too many people make good videos
[17229.75s -> 17233.35s]  Raid raid joel ray. Yeah. Well, what's he doing? What's joel up to today?
[17234.70s -> 17236.70s]  Go find out what joel is doing
[17237.02s -> 17245.46s]  Rated joel in a while having fun doing rock smith rock smith, huh?
[17247.72s -> 17249.59s]  Isn't that the
[17249.59s -> 17251.59s]  Don't you play a real guitar?
[17251.59s -> 17255.59s]  Wait, isn't guitar wait, isn't rock smith guitar hero people that actually know music?
[17264.10s -> 17267.21s]  I mean, I already like it so far. I was only there for five seconds
[17269.96s -> 17272.04s]  He's actually playing the guitar. All right, that's cool. Yeah
[17277.91s -> 17279.35s]  Uh, let's do the credits
[17279.35s -> 17288.15s]  Thank you again everybody
[17288.15s -> 17290.15s]  Goal raid. Yeah, we will after the credits
[17292.36s -> 17295.00s]  Yeah, I probably i'm gonna I don't think ai dungeon to me
[17295.08s -> 17297.08s]  I feel like you do it for a little while
[17297.72s -> 17299.72s]  And then you have to take a break for a while
[17300.04s -> 17302.36s]  So I don't think we're gonna go back to it for a little while
[17303.51s -> 17306.47s]  I feel like there needs to be a cooldown period because it just gets too wild
[17307.11s -> 17312.49s]  But when we play it, it's a ton of fun. So friday, we're gonna do eternal darkness
[17313.05s -> 17320.78s]  And hopefully I see you there. If not, if it's not part of your schedule, then that's all right
[17321.50s -> 17323.67s]  You never come back to another stream again
[17324.23s -> 17328.60s]  Hey, that's cool, too
[17328.60s -> 17337.74s]  But like, you know, you don't you check out another one sometime, but i'll see you on friday. Let's run the credits right now
[17339.96s -> 17342.20s]  ready three two
[17342.84s -> 17347.59s]  Bring them on all in alphabetical order
[17348.23s -> 17355.11s]  Totally excited to finally watch joel because I was anticipating anticipating the stream
[17355.83s -> 17358.98s]  I feel like that's a good place. That's probably a real pain in the ass to set up
[17359.70s -> 17364.92s]  If you're using a real guitar
[17364.92s -> 17369.98s]  I feel like that's very difficult to do
[17372.76s -> 17374.76s]  A custom song sue. Well, that's awesome
[17378.86s -> 17381.10s]  I should do it. I have no idea how to play the guitar
[17382.60s -> 17385.80s]  My pinky can I can't play guitar hero. My pinky cannot hit the orange button
[17386.36s -> 17389.43s]  I have to play guitar here on medium only
[17390.50s -> 17393.06s]  Because I can only do the three buttons. I can't do four
[17398.71s -> 17400.71s]  Don't use the pinky. I have to
[17404.52s -> 17406.42s]  the drum stream
[17406.42s -> 17410.26s]  I could you know what I could probably really do like a rock band drum stream
[17411.54s -> 17415.06s]  And a lot of you think that I may be messing around but I can do all that stuff on expert
[17420.38s -> 17422.38s]  But I think what I I don't think I can do that though
[17422.94s -> 17425.02s]  All the just the it's just copyright music the stream
[17428.31s -> 17439.16s]  Maybe it's true. Yeah now on twitch now, you're gonna be careful with the copyright stuff
[17440.82s -> 17443.99s]  my understanding
[17443.99s -> 17445.83s]  do custom songs
[17445.83s -> 17450.95s]  That might work for a little while. I don't think I think that might get a little old to me after about six hours though
[17455.40s -> 17460.84s]  Doing just custom songs. I think I feel like if I heard like 85 different remixes the rat song
[17461.96s -> 17466.76s]  I know I feel like I'd probably want to it's like that. What are the songs do I have on this channel?
[17468.02s -> 17470.66s]  It'd be it'd be 40 giant enemy spiders
[17471.54s -> 17476.74s]  30 rat remixes and then the germa craft script with a beat behind it
[17477.78s -> 17482.89s]  That's what I would have to do
[17482.89s -> 17484.62s]  But we'll see you friday
[17484.62s -> 17486.23s]  Thanks for watching guys
[17486.23s -> 17488.23s]  Add on over to joel say hello
[17488.23s -> 17551.69s]  Take care
