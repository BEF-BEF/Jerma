[4.79s -> 15.19s]  Hey, what is going on everybody Jerma here with a sorcery exclamation mark gameplay commentary and before don't this is a text-based adventure type game
[15.19s -> 18.23s]  Don't nobody freak out. I just want to let you know beforehand
[18.27s -> 24.29s]  This is not like a hack and slash a party up and like throw fireballs at people that you kind of do
[24.53s -> 30.01s]  But it's very slow. It's very deliberate. It's a game to lie down and relax and play in bed
[30.13s -> 35.25s]  It's got like hundreds of thousands of words. So if you don't like reading
[36.77s -> 41.25s]  Wait a second. It's a fantasy world. It's like a choose-your-own-adventure book
[43.57s -> 48.87s]  Just calm down for a second just chill out. Okay. No, it's a fun game. Trust me. You just have to sit
[56.61s -> 59.28s]  Okay, so sorcery is
[60.48s -> 68.22s]  Like I said previously a text-based adventure game where your choices and your paps can lead to different conclusions
[68.22s -> 72.70s]  And it's based on a series of game books by Steve Jackson
[72.70s -> 77.62s]  Which is why it's called Steve Jackson sorcery and it's a whole lot of fun for the longest time
[77.62s -> 79.06s]  I've been saying to myself man
[79.06s -> 85.70s]  I wish they would bring back the choose-your-own-adventure books or the game books from back in like the 80s in the early 90s
[85.78s -> 90.10s]  Who remembers the old goosebump books? Remember those old like goose by?
[90.14s -> 93.82s]  There was one it was like a carnival and there were multiple ways you could die
[94.14s -> 98.94s]  Multiple ways you could escape and it was a ton of fun when I was a teenager sitting down lying in my bed
[99.06s -> 105.62s]  Flipping through these books. It was exciting because you never knew if the decision you were gonna make was gonna be the right one
[105.62s -> 109.06s]  Or will it be the wrong one? And is this way you die?
[109.62s -> 112.57s]  That feeling made me want to read
[112.65s -> 118.05s]  It made me want to pick up another one of these books and fine and try my luck at how far I can get in this
[118.05s -> 119.29s]  Susparner
[119.29s -> 127.05s]  That was cool back in the day and now it seems like this company Inkle who is the the group responsible for
[127.25s -> 131.21s]  Porting Steve Jackson series over to iOS and Android
[131.71s -> 137.51s]  They're doing a great job and it's fun to see them actually do this and then try to revitalize this old platform
[137.91s -> 143.63s]  That has sort of fallen off the beaten path in the last 15 20 years or so
[143.79s -> 150.05s]  But the way the game actually plays is sort of a good condensed version of the old books
[150.05s -> 157.35s]  There is an entire spell casting system with dozens of spells in this game that you can cast in a million different
[157.67s -> 161.75s]  Situations and see how they all turn out and there's a combat system as well
[161.75s -> 165.85s]  There is an actual sword play system over the course of your travels
[165.85s -> 172.67s]  You're going to encounter people like this guy that are pretty strong. You'll also encounter pretty weak enemies as well
[172.71s -> 177.43s]  They're not all as difficult and powerful as this guy, but it's a tug-of-war system, right?
[177.43s -> 180.35s]  So if I swing my sword harder than he does
[180.51s -> 184.75s]  I'm going to do the damage to him and vice versa. We have stamina meters
[184.75s -> 191.31s]  So you don't want to drain all your stamina in one swing which will then force you to defend and when you defend you are
[191.47s -> 196.59s]  Guaranteed to take one point of damage if the other enemy decides to swing at you
[196.59s -> 199.67s]  so you really want to play the cat-and-mouse game you want to play the tug-of-war game and
[199.87s -> 204.37s]  Try to keep your stamina above zero because when it hits zero you die
[204.53s -> 208.20s]  But regardless of any of this it spices up
[208.28s -> 216.10s]  What could just be a typical text adventure and Inkle has done an amazing job at making this not just feel like I'm reading a book and
[216.42s -> 221.02s]  Choosing little choices and reading the outcomes. I actually feel like I'm part of this little game world
[221.02s -> 224.74s]  It's like a board game the way you move your character around the map
[224.74s -> 230.94s]  It's a huge detailed world that you actually get to move around and then read about where you just went
[230.94s -> 237.04s]  And this is book two of the sorcery series. There is four books. There is four books
[237.04s -> 240.60s]  that's full, but there are four books in this series and
[241.76s -> 247.04s]  Episode three or part three should be coming out within the next I don't know
[247.04s -> 249.44s]  I know this just recently came out last year
[249.48s -> 255.08s]  So I don't want to like throw the developers under the bus and be like yeah sorcery three will come out in March of
[255.48s -> 258.44s]  2015 no, I don't know all I know is that they're working on it
[258.44s -> 261.00s]  They just released a new game not that long ago
[261.00s -> 266.08s]  So they're probably in between projects, but I would say pick up both of them if you like this kind of thing
[266.20s -> 268.20s]  It's gonna cost you
[268.48s -> 272.16s]  $3 for sorcery one the first part of the adventure and
[272.68s -> 275.24s]  five bucks for sorcery two
[275.88s -> 279.04s]  Eight bucks for the whole thing the whole experience so far
[279.54s -> 285.04s]  Depending on how many times you play through it and try to get all the different items and all the different weapons and all the
[285.28s -> 288.44s]  Scenarios to play out. It's probably gonna take you quite some time
[288.44s -> 294.29s]  I don't really want to put a hour number on it because you I don't want to put that in your head
[294.29s -> 298.81s]  I don't want to say oh the game will take you three and a half hours because you then you you're thinking about that
[298.81s -> 300.21s]  You're not engrossed in the story
[300.21s -> 304.57s]  It's gonna vary for every single person how long it takes them to play through their first time
[304.65s -> 308.17s]  Because some people will do some stuff very quickly other people will be going
[308.17s -> 311.17s]  Sort of around in a circle and trying to find a way it's it's a lot
[311.17s -> 318.73s]  It's different for everybody and it's enjoyable. Nonetheless, however, you play through it eight bucks again. It's on Android
[318.73s -> 322.73s]  It's on the app store links will be in the description if you want to check it out check it out
[322.73s -> 326.31s]  That's gonna wrap up the video guys. Thank you so much for watching really do appreciate it. I'll take y'all every day. That's a fair
[327.17s -> 329.60s]  Everybody take care
