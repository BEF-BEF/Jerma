[0.31s -> 12.89s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here, and MLC Stealth.
[12.89s -> 17.43s]  And today, Untimed Chaos Build. You can't start yet.
[17.43s -> 19.43s]  I wasn't, I was hiding.
[19.43s -> 24.43s]  Today we're going to be doing another Timed Chaos Build. We're going to be building Sonic the Hedgehog.
[24.43s -> 29.30s]  Because we haven't done really any gaming related things.
[29.30s -> 36.54s]  I mean, the only thing we came close to was the Super Mario Cheetos freaking like Pringles Man that we did with the first episode.
[36.54s -> 40.71s]  So, we're going to end up doing an actual gaming, iconic gaming character, Sonic the Hedgehog.
[40.71s -> 44.19s]  And we've got seven minutes to do it. So are you ready Stealth?
[44.19s -> 47.37s]  I am absolutely not ready because it's going to be bad.
[47.37s -> 54.26s]  So let's see how this goes. We've got seven minutes in three, two, one, go.
[54.26s -> 56.26s]  So we're starting his feet?
[56.26s -> 57.26s]  Yeah, I'll do the front leg.
[57.26s -> 61.26s]  Let's try to not make him like as tall as Andre the Giant.
[61.26s -> 63.26s]  That's probably a good idea.
[63.26s -> 68.26s]  We always make their legs like ten, like a hundred feet apart from each other.
[68.26s -> 70.26s]  And then it's like, oh man, this guy's going to be huge.
[70.26s -> 75.26s]  Alright, so wait, is Sonic the Hedgehog's whole shoe is blue? I mean, blue, red?
[75.26s -> 77.82s]  German, this color is red.
[77.82s -> 78.82s]  Okay, yeah, that's fine.
[78.82s -> 80.82s]  Here, make his feet a little bit longer, like that long.
[80.82s -> 83.58s]  Okay. Well, he's like running.
[83.58s -> 89.88s]  Yeah, this, yeah, no. Well, he has, wait, no, it's too, that's too long.
[89.88s -> 93.18s]  No, it's not. It's fine. He's good.
[93.18s -> 95.18s]  Why are his feet going that way?
[95.18s -> 97.36s]  Because he's going to be like running.
[97.36s -> 98.36s]  What?
[98.36s -> 100.36s]  No, just go. We don't have time.
[100.36s -> 102.36s]  What?
[102.36s -> 103.36s]  We don't have time.
[103.36s -> 104.36s]  Which way is he facing?
[104.36s -> 106.36s]  I don't know. He's facing that way.
[106.36s -> 110.54s]  What? Okay. He's facing the other way.
[111.90s -> 115.72s]  I don't know what you did with this sideways foot over here.
[115.72s -> 120.60s]  He's plieing right now. That's like what he's doing.
[120.60s -> 122.60s]  Great.
[122.60s -> 126.60s]  No, because this is going to, this leg's going to...
[126.60s -> 129.60s]  This is ballet Sonic the Hedgehog, apparently.
[129.60s -> 131.60s]  Look at him, he's plieing.
[131.60s -> 135.46s]  All right, this has to be a little bit shorter, like this.
[135.46s -> 137.47s]  All right.
[137.47s -> 138.47s]  Dang it.
[138.47s -> 140.47s]  One, almost one and a half minutes have gone by.
[140.47s -> 141.47s]  Oh, boy.
[141.47s -> 142.47s]  All right.
[142.47s -> 143.47s]  We made two feet.
[143.47s -> 145.65s]  That's fine. That's fine.
[147.65s -> 148.65s]  Have him come up.
[148.65s -> 150.65s]  We never give him any legs.
[150.65s -> 154.65s]  He could go straight from like knee to freaking body.
[155.65s -> 157.65s]  I got to do the spikes.
[157.65s -> 159.65s]  I'm going to do the spikes.
[160.65s -> 161.65s]  We don't have time.
[161.65s -> 162.65s]  I can't even finish this.
[162.65s -> 164.65s]  I don't even know what this is.
[164.65s -> 165.65s]  Is he on his knees?
[165.65s -> 169.65s]  Why is this leg like two inches long?
[169.65s -> 170.65s]  Look at his left leg.
[170.65s -> 176.65s]  I have no, I have no idea how to do the spikes on his back.
[177.65s -> 178.65s]  I don't know.
[178.65s -> 179.65s]  I have no idea how to do this.
[179.65s -> 181.65s]  Look at how long his legs are.
[184.82s -> 186.82s]  Screw it, straight to the head.
[186.82s -> 192.38s]  The head is like the most iconic part of him, so I'm going to make sure at least that's there.
[192.38s -> 194.38s]  I'm like losing breath, man.
[196.38s -> 198.38s]  All right, here comes the spikes.
[198.38s -> 201.14s]  Doesn't he have white in the spikes, too?
[201.14s -> 203.95s]  Sure.
[203.95s -> 205.95s]  All right, it's head time.
[205.95s -> 206.95s]  Yeah, you do the head.
[206.95s -> 210.60s]  What color is his mouth?
[210.60s -> 212.60s]  He's got a giant hand.
[212.60s -> 214.60s]  It's a giant hand on legs.
[218.16s -> 220.16s]  This is not Sonic the Hedgehog.
[221.16s -> 225.16s]  We almost three minutes have gone by trying to make it remotely Sonic the Hedgehog.
[225.16s -> 226.16s]  How long do we have?
[226.16s -> 228.16s]  We have like four minutes.
[228.16s -> 230.16s]  All right, he has white on his stomach, doesn't he?
[232.17s -> 234.17s]  Kind of like a penguin?
[236.73s -> 237.73s]  Oh, crap.
[237.73s -> 239.73s]  You have the wrong thing.
[239.73s -> 241.73s]  Hold on, I'm getting wool.
[241.73s -> 244.48s]  All right, I'm getting the spikes to come out of his head.
[248.92s -> 253.92s]  All right, it's starting to look like space bug Sonic the Hedgehog.
[255.67s -> 258.67s]  Wait, his mouth is somewhat like that.
[264.88s -> 265.88s]  All right, arms.
[265.88s -> 272.31s]  If you had to take a guess at what this was, you would never be able to guess this.
[272.31s -> 274.31s]  He's supposed to be running.
[275.31s -> 278.31s]  I still have no idea what the heck you did with his right leg.
[279.31s -> 281.31s]  I thought we were going the other way.
[283.19s -> 286.19s]  He kind of looks like the Mass Effect alien race.
[286.19s -> 290.25s]  What's that Mass Effect like alien girl?
[290.25s -> 291.25s]  What is her name?
[291.25s -> 294.49s]  She's the one with like the space suit, I think.
[294.49s -> 296.49s]  No, I'm not. I'll never be able to guess that.
[297.86s -> 299.48s]  All right.
[299.48s -> 302.91s]  Oh, cool. Good thing we got Scorpion Sonic the Hedgehog.
[302.91s -> 305.98s]  The actual bug Scorpion.
[305.98s -> 306.98s]  Four minutes have gone by.
[306.98s -> 308.54s]  That's his hand.
[315.55s -> 316.55s]  He's broken.
[316.55s -> 317.55s]  He is completely broken.
[317.55s -> 319.55s]  He's broken in so many different pieces.
[321.05s -> 322.05s]  I don't even know how to fix this.
[322.05s -> 324.05s]  I don't know. I don't know how to fix this.
[324.05s -> 325.05s]  This is so broken.
[325.05s -> 327.05s]  This is so screwed up.
[327.05s -> 329.05s]  Look at how many directions his body is going in.
[330.05s -> 331.05s]  You know what he looks like?
[331.05s -> 332.05s]  He looks like you took his head.
[332.05s -> 333.05s]  You twisted it.
[333.05s -> 334.05s]  You took his body.
[334.05s -> 335.05s]  You twisted it.
[335.05s -> 337.05s]  And you took his legs and you twisted it in completely different directions.
[338.05s -> 339.05s]  And that's how you left him.
[340.05s -> 346.05s]  Like imagine he's on it like all like he has head and his stomach and his legs are in a 360 degree plane.
[346.05s -> 348.05s]  And you spun him in random directions.
[349.05s -> 351.46s]  All right, we got we need more spikes.
[351.46s -> 353.46s]  I don't he doesn't have this many spikes.
[354.46s -> 355.46s]  Well, it's all right.
[355.46s -> 358.02s]  He looks like a character.
[360.02s -> 361.02s]  Okay, let's give him eyes.
[361.02s -> 362.02s]  First off, give him the eyes.
[362.02s -> 364.02s]  It'll look like normal with the eyes.
[367.72s -> 372.01s]  And then he has to have like the hair come up like this.
[374.57s -> 375.57s]  Normal with the eyes.
[377.57s -> 378.57s]  Five minutes and 25 seconds.
[380.57s -> 382.57s]  This is if I was this Sonic the Hedgehog.
[383.57s -> 388.57s]  This this guy is in like I know we've said this before, but I would be in pain.
[388.57s -> 390.57s]  I would be in so much pain as this character.
[390.57s -> 399.25s]  There is no words to describe what we have created here, but it absolutely is not Sonic the Hedgehog.
[399.25s -> 402.25s]  No, no, it's not.
[402.25s -> 404.38s]  Sounds like it's going great.
[409.74s -> 410.74s]  He's ET.
[413.87s -> 416.87s]  We have a we still have a full minute and I don't even know where to go.
[417.87s -> 419.87s]  There's no fixing this.
[419.87s -> 420.87s]  Oh, check it out.
[420.87s -> 422.87s]  It's ET with giant.
[422.87s -> 423.87s]  I don't know.
[423.87s -> 425.05s]  All right.
[425.05s -> 426.05s]  Come over here.
[426.05s -> 427.05s]  Let's at least fix this.
[427.05s -> 429.05s]  You said he doesn't have these spikes coming out all over the place.
[430.29s -> 431.29s]  You know what he is?
[431.29s -> 432.29s]  He's a maze.
[433.29s -> 435.29s]  He's a standing up maze.
[437.53s -> 439.53s]  I always make the hands the same way.
[439.53s -> 442.53s]  They look like four fingers and they look like pitchforks every single time.
[443.53s -> 444.53s]  It's going to be more like glove based.
[445.53s -> 449.46s]  Oh, that did it.
[449.46s -> 450.46s]  That fixed it.
[450.46s -> 451.46s]  Germica job.
[451.46s -> 452.46s]  It's made it ten times worse.
[452.46s -> 453.70s]  Like Sonic.
[453.70s -> 454.70s]  There you go.
[454.70s -> 456.38s]  All right.
[456.38s -> 459.20s]  Let's just make them have like a giant tongue coming out.
[460.38s -> 461.38s]  Yeah.
[461.38s -> 462.38s]  All right.
[462.38s -> 467.38s]  Well, we have plush toys that you get like mad at and you like squeeze it and everything just pops out.
[467.38s -> 468.38s]  He really looks like a squeeze.
[468.38s -> 469.38s]  Looks like one of the squeeze toys.
[469.38s -> 470.74s]  All right.
[470.74s -> 471.74s]  Well, we have three seconds.
[471.74s -> 473.74s]  Three, two, one.
[473.74s -> 475.74s]  And what's up?
[475.74s -> 476.74s]  Let's set the time.
[477.74s -> 478.74s]  Wrong thing.
[478.74s -> 479.74s]  We like even tried.
[481.56s -> 482.56s]  Oh, man.
[482.56s -> 483.86s]  There he is.
[483.86s -> 485.86s]  There is Sonic the Hedgehog.
[490.58s -> 491.58s]  All right.
[491.58s -> 494.58s]  So if you want to give it a different name, by all means, go ahead.
[496.20s -> 498.20s]  Let us know how we did.
[498.20s -> 500.20s]  That has to Sonic is that they're both blue.
[500.20s -> 502.44s]  That is literally it.
[502.44s -> 504.44s]  That's the only that's the only similarity.
[504.44s -> 506.45s]  All right, guys.
[506.45s -> 507.45s]  Cool.
[507.45s -> 508.45s]  Thank you so much for watching.
[508.45s -> 509.45s]  I really do appreciate it.
[509.45s -> 510.94s]  My goodness.
[510.94s -> 511.94s]  My goodness.
[511.94s -> 512.94s]  How did this happen?
[512.94s -> 517.91s]  How did this happen?
[517.91s -> 522.39s]  Seriously, just like two inches long legs.
[522.39s -> 525.57s]  It went from his feet to his body.
[525.57s -> 528.57s]  Oh, well, see you guys all next time.
[528.57s -> 529.57s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
[529.57s -> 532.90s]  Thanks for watching.
[532.90s -> 533.90s]  Oh, my God.
[533.90s -> 534.90s]  This is hard.
[534.90s -> 535.90s]  This is insane.
