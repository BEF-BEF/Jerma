[7.35s -> 21.61s]  Just making sure it works. Hello everybody. How you doing? Good afternoon. Hope all is well,
[21.61s -> 36.65s]  wherever you are. He speaks. Sometimes. Sometimes he speaks. Yeah, I saw the house flipper update.
[36.65s -> 46.06s]  Garden flipper, right? Is it blood on my coffee cup? No. No, it's dried coffee. I was like,
[46.06s -> 58.20s]  what are they? What? Drinking blood. No, but how you doing? Today we're gonna do something
[58.20s -> 66.66s]  we did last week. I thought it was a lot of fun. And I want to try it again. MS DOS,
[67.38s -> 76.38s]  the archive website. It's still up. It's still available. So we're gonna do some more of that.
[77.27s -> 84.12s]  It's gonna be different this time, though. Last time, we had a little thing on the right
[84.12s -> 88.73s]  where you could scroll. You cannot do that this time. We're gonna try it differently.
[89.78s -> 100.01s]  This time, we are going to pick three from the list. And then I'm just scrolling after
[100.01s -> 110.31s]  we do three. Or I might veto two of them and then just scroll. We'll see. All right,
[110.31s -> 120.52s]  I tweeted, right? I think we're good to go. Mario's gonna put this on a fort of a kind.
[123.40s -> 127.72s]  I don't know. I don't think we're gonna see Mario again. Does Mario have more than one
[127.72s -> 131.00s]  MS DOS game? And are we going to come across it? That's the real question.
[134.09s -> 144.57s]  Why not just play every game? I can't do that. There's too many of them. All right, so
[145.29s -> 152.06s]  welcome again. Happy, happy Saturday. And why don't we just get this off the screen and
[152.70s -> 158.41s]  look at that. Don't click yet. It's not ready yet. I believe this is where we left off.
[159.82s -> 171.14s]  I think it is because I was on page five. So like we did last time,
[171.14s -> 177.75s]  notice there's nothing on this side of the screen. Nope. Just a central location.
[183.22s -> 192.20s]  What's this page called again? This is the archive.org MS DOS archive.org.
[194.12s -> 202.06s]  There's software on here too, but I don't, I didn't put it on here. I'm only doing the games
[202.06s -> 214.63s]  because the software is command prompts and video. No, there was no video editing.
[214.63s -> 222.15s]  What programs existed that went on games where I missed off? Get ready to click.
[222.79s -> 234.44s]  Here's your first click of the evening. You can do it now. Software spreadsheets. Yeah,
[234.44s -> 239.62s]  it's about, it's not, it's boring stuff. So let's see. First pick of the day.
[241.61s -> 252.46s]  Looks like we have something called Alter Ego Mail. Is this a personality test? There's one
[252.46s -> 260.46s]  of two things. This is either personality test or porn game. We'll have to find out.
[260.46s -> 269.29s]  It's from Activision. Did Activision ever make any porn games? I don't think they may have.
[270.01s -> 282.70s]  Who knows? Okay. That's a pretty significant amount of people that want to see Alter Ego Mail.
[287.00s -> 309.24s]  All right. Let's go. Okay. Let's start it. Are you ready? Three, two, one. Here it comes.
[309.24s -> 314.36s]  Activision presents Alter Ego. Whoa, what's going on down there? You can like scan people.
[314.36s -> 323.48s]  Please enter your name. Okay. We're going to go with Jerma. No, should I put that? Should
[323.48s -> 327.77s]  I put something else? Should I put like, I don't want to put my name. What if somebody has
[327.77s -> 351.43s]  it? I wonder who that could be. Jared. Jared. Alter Ego personality development profile.
[352.25s -> 356.97s]  Use the arrow keys to move the pointer next to a response. Press space to select that response.
[358.49s -> 362.09s]  Let me select my own personality. Let the computer select my personality.
[362.73s -> 367.88s]  Let computer select my personality. Then let me examine or edit it.
[367.88s -> 374.49s]  I need to make my own personality, right? Yeah, I gotta, I can't, I'm not gonna let
[374.49s -> 381.06s]  somebody tell me who I am. I will probably try to answer these questions honestly.
[383.78s -> 393.11s]  Yeah, that's true. I'm likely to speak whatever comes to my mind. Yeah, I will. I do. I do that
[393.11s -> 397.88s]  all the time on stream. I just, shit just comes out. I'm a light sleeper who stirs
[397.88s -> 405.69s]  at even the slightest sound. This is absolutely true. I, I'm so bad. It doesn't matter.
[405.69s -> 413.30s]  A dog barking like 500 yards down that way will wake me up. Somebody's sneezing
[414.10s -> 422.81s]  in my neighbor's house. I'll wake up to it. Revenge is sweet. How do I get there? Oh,
[422.81s -> 426.89s]  I'm likely to speak whatever comes to my mind. I'll probably try to answer normally. I'm a light
[426.89s -> 434.23s]  sleeper. Revenge is sweet. How do I answer this? What kind, what do you mean revenge? Revenge
[434.23s -> 441.11s]  is sweet. What kind of revenge? I don't know. That's, that might not be true. I don't know
[441.11s -> 449.06s]  if I can answer that one. But like revenge, just general revenge. Do you like to get
[449.06s -> 457.66s]  revenge? No, it doesn't do anything. Have you seen every movie ever made? I often feel slow,
[457.66s -> 468.25s]  tired, and down in the dumps. This, uh, he's a liar. I'm, uh, all right, hold on. Is this,
[468.25s -> 475.43s]  this is a two parter here though. I often feel slow, tired, and down in the dumps. I often
[475.43s -> 480.97s]  feel like tired, but not down in the dumps. That's not completely true. An important part
[480.97s -> 486.98s]  of every job is knowing who to impress, Twitch chat. I am fascinated by car accidents and
[486.98s -> 499.22s]  their disaster scenes. I don't think, no, no. Why would this be a question? See, this is one of
[499.22s -> 504.98s]  those tests where it's trying to find the psycho. Oh, I feel sorry. Sometimes I'm tired. Oh,
[504.98s -> 511.64s]  impress people if you want. Yeah, car accidents are cool, right? Yeah, no, no, no, wait. The
[511.64s -> 520.66s]  people who know me best like me as a person. Yeah, I think so. I think people like, like
[520.66s -> 526.98s]  people that know me well like me. I'm extremely sensitive to criticism. Yeah, that was that
[526.98s -> 530.82s]  one time like, like four nights ago somebody said my stream sucked and I got really mad.
[531.54s -> 536.18s]  Uh, I get nervous performing in front of people even when the task is something I know by heart.
[536.18s -> 544.86s]  Nope. The people around me seem happier than I do. I don't, I don't know about that.
[553.02s -> 558.63s]  Uh, the people around me seem, I don't think so. No. I often get the urge to touch walls
[558.63s -> 563.93s]  on which wet paint signs are hung. No, because then you get paint on your hands
[563.93s -> 571.99s]  for the rest of the day and it sucks. I've done it. When I am ill, I become short tempered and
[571.99s -> 582.81s]  snap at people. Ill? No, I just like kind of sleep. I just, I just kind of do my own thing.
[583.85s -> 589.45s]  An important mattress, I usually follow my, no, no, one on important matters. I usually
[589.45s -> 599.05s]  follow my parents advice even when I disagree with it. No, I mean, my mother's got great
[599.05s -> 605.05s]  advice, but you know, I like to, I like to be me. You know, it is possible that I like, I take
[605.05s -> 611.86s]  advice and then I, I kind of let it sit for a while and then I say, what about my idea? And
[611.86s -> 617.21s]  then I kind of mold them together and then I get the best idea. It is possible that we live
[617.21s -> 623.26s]  in a world where people can watch our every move. Yes. That, that, that, yes, that's
[623.26s -> 631.61s]  true. Uh, it is very possible. I don't know when they made this game, but it is, is real.
[631.61s -> 640.23s]  When I'm in a quiet place, I get the urge to scream. Yeah. This is why I can't go to the movies.
[640.23s -> 644.71s]  I can't sit there, but no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, no, no, no, no, that's, that's kind of,
[644.71s -> 651.06s]  I send this, assuming that I just scream at the movies. No, no, that's not quiet.
[651.06s -> 661.64s]  And I meant like sit still. No, that's true. I need like stimulation or I lose my fucking
[661.64s -> 667.80s]  mind. It's okay to tell a white lie if it is guaranteed to bring great personal gain.
[667.88s -> 693.86s]  Done that quite, quite a bit on this stream. I'm kidding. It, no, it's true. Wait, this is,
[693.86s -> 700.31s]  we're talking, we're talking, I'm not a sociopath. Okay. I lied about Ace Attorney. So it happens.
[701.03s -> 703.91s]  I didn't, but I didn't though. That you just, you just perceiving that as a lie.
[706.25s -> 711.13s]  It is often pointless to try to discuss problems with other people. What? No. What?
[711.13s -> 715.98s]  No, somebody like to bounce a vent off of and bounce off. No, what are you talking about?
[715.98s -> 722.52s]  I'm easily embarrassed. No. Dermaraptor proves that. Children should be seen and not heard.
[722.52s -> 733.72s]  Are we talking about like, are we talking about like on the airplane? Like when the kids like
[733.72s -> 736.52s]  screaming and crying and like kicking the back of the seat. Is that what they're talking about
[736.52s -> 747.11s]  here? What are they talking about? What does it mean? Children should be seen and not heard.
[747.11s -> 752.22s]  No, but like kids are fun. Kids are like funny and interesting and they say all kinds, no.
[756.52s -> 760.12s]  I find it difficult to break the ice in conversations with people I barely know.
[760.12s -> 765.61s]  That's not true. My parents were strict disciplinarians. No. You can usually judge
[765.61s -> 776.25s]  a person by first impressions. No. People, no, I don't think so. One way of getting people
[776.25s -> 780.57s]  to treat you fairly is to take an aggressive stance and make them win you over. What?
[784.50s -> 794.09s]  What kind of weird, like take an aggressive stance and make them win you over. But what
[794.09s -> 799.40s]  does aggressive stance mean? Like you really get out there and you'd be, what does that
[799.40s -> 807.83s]  mean? Do you just say something crazy and then see if they like you? I mean, I usually,
[807.83s -> 817.77s]  I'm pretty boisterous. Maybe. Yeah. I think that questions like this are stupid and meaningless.
[820.28s -> 825.08s]  Like that. Yes. This one. Yes. I do think this question is meaningless because it's just,
[825.08s -> 829.53s]  it doesn't mean anything. Uh, dark soul. Thanks to the five community subs, dark soul,
[829.53s -> 835.86s]  a five sub drop from dark soul. That's the way this is the game. This is the game. We
[835.86s -> 842.82s]  haven't started the game yet. Please select the stage of life at which you would like
[842.90s -> 849.94s]  to begin the game. Birth and infancy. What? You could be a baby. Are we going to try to
[849.94s -> 859.48s]  live all through our whole life here? Birth and infancy. What if I, all right. Welcome
[859.48s -> 867.35s]  to birth and infancy. Every man is the architect of his own fortune. Solace, Gaia,
[867.35s -> 876.23s]  Solistius, Crispus. Speech to Caesar on the state. Sec I. Am I Julius Caesar?
[879.16s -> 888.18s]  Is that me? You are in a warm, dark, comfortable place. This has been your place since you became
[888.18s -> 895.42s]  aware that you are alive. It's almost time to enter a different world now. Select an action.
[895.42s -> 905.11s]  Stay in a little longer. Come out fighting. Come out peacefully. Stay in a little longer.
[905.11s -> 912.89s]  You start swinging at the doctor. I'm staying in a little longer. Okay. You certainly can't be
[912.89s -> 918.25s]  blamed for wanting to stay someplace safe and warm. Besides, you are learning early the social
[918.25s -> 936.71s]  merits of being fashionably late. Sure am. What time is it? 4 15 p.m.
[938.23s -> 945.80s]  Don't you think your mother has had enough aggravation carrying you in her belly for
[945.80s -> 955.45s]  nine long months? Stop being a freeloader and step out into the real world. All right, fine.
[955.45s -> 967.42s]  I'm gonna come out peacefully. I never come out fighting when I'm late. I'm always just like,
[967.42s -> 976.70s]  hey, what's going on, YouTubers? What a good sport. Are you sure you're ready for this?
[976.70s -> 981.02s]  It can get pretty hectic out there. I'll give you one more chance to try to stay a while
[981.02s -> 984.54s]  longer. Would you like it? What do you mean? Why are you like making me sign up a game tap
[984.54s -> 994.79s]  again? This is the game tap thing all over again. That's the spirit. You are an easy
[994.79s -> 998.23s]  delivery. No, no, no. I was trying to say no. I got fucking conned into coming out here.
[1000.22s -> 1004.94s]  That's the spirit. You are an easy delivery. Your mom and dad took special classes to help you.
[1006.15s -> 1009.83s]  Go out there and give them heck. You're still too young to swear.
[1010.47s -> 1016.46s]  Happy birthday and welcome to the world. From now on, life will begin to change rapidly.
[1016.46s -> 1020.94s]  You will have to learn to accept responsibility, build up your resources, and manage
[1020.94s -> 1027.91s]  yourself physically and emotionally. The events that transpire over the course of the next
[1027.91s -> 1036.23s]  few days include your rich aunt Martha places a $500 bond and trust for you. Thanks. You're the
[1036.23s -> 1043.21s]  most beautiful baby in the maternity ward and everyone takes your picture. All right. Starting
[1043.21s -> 1048.55s]  out pretty good here. Your father buys you a baseball bat and glove for you to use in a year
[1048.55s -> 1055.96s]  or so when you get older. A baseball bat and a glove when I'm one and a half years old. How's
[1055.96s -> 1062.90s]  that gonna work? I'm gonna be one with a... you can't even fucking think. What is this?
[1062.90s -> 1071.80s]  Do I have to select something? Oh shit. What is this? I don't know. Should I do like the emote
[1071.80s -> 1078.33s]  face or hearts? Which one of these do I do? I don't know what these mean. All right. I'm going
[1078.33s -> 1084.22s]  for like the I'm so intelligent. Lying on your stomach in the crib, you notice an interesting
[1084.22s -> 1089.90s]  object and arms distance away. It has a round shape at the top and a ring on the bottom.
[1089.90s -> 1102.60s]  Select a mood. Anger, frustration, determination. Determination and grasp for object.
[1102.68s -> 1108.18s]  You have the fighting spirit of your uncle Bill. You sneak and crawl on your belly like a combat
[1108.18s -> 1113.06s]  soldier heading into battle. You reach your destination, grasp the rattle confidently,
[1113.06s -> 1120.84s]  and drool on it in victory. Intellectual sphere shows a marked increase. Shake the rattle.
[1120.84s -> 1124.36s]  Keep drooling on it. Emit a pleasurable yell. I would do that. I'd be like,
[1127.56s -> 1132.12s]  this stimulates vocal cords and language centers in your brain. Good language skills
[1132.12s -> 1136.52s]  are essential to development. Intellectual sphere increases. If no one is looking,
[1136.52s -> 1143.61s]  give a little yell yourself for choosing this option. Go on. Did you do it? I actually did.
[1143.61s -> 1152.54s]  Select an action. Yes or no. What? Yes or no to what? Yes. Oh no, I did. Yeah, I did it.
[1152.54s -> 1159.13s]  Yes, I did. Good. I just gave you some extra social points for being good sport. I'm already
[1159.13s -> 1169.66s]  getting some good points here. Um, now where? What is it? What is this? A woman walks into
[1169.66s -> 1180.47s]  a room holding a blanket and a bottle with warm white liquid. Selective mood. Happy. Action. Coup.
[1180.47s -> 1190.81s]  Happy and coup. Why would I be angry? I just got extreme victory. I would coup.
[1190.81s -> 1195.38s]  Nothing like a nice warm bottle and a quick hug from mom to get a kid ready to face the world.
[1195.38s -> 1199.94s]  As she walks toward you with the bottle, she sees you smiling and interprets this as a
[1199.94s -> 1204.68s]  sign that you want to play with her. She picks you up and holds you for 10 minutes.
[1204.68s -> 1215.99s]  This presents you with quite a dilemma. Cry. Okay, mom can see that you have had enough
[1215.99s -> 1225.77s]  for now. She feeds you your bottle and walks away. You don't have very many skills yet.
[1225.77s -> 1233.99s]  As a matter of fact, life is pretty boring. Restless and irritable. Uh, restless and
[1233.99s -> 1239.00s]  irritable. I want to look around. Feel like you're going stir crazy. I can just imagine.
[1239.00s -> 1243.70s]  The room is filled with bright colors, but you have trouble focusing on any of them.
[1243.70s -> 1248.26s]  Cry and yell for attention. Keep looking around. Keep looking around. You look around
[1248.26s -> 1253.48s]  and see a large blur about 11 inches away from your eye. Every once in a while, it moves.
[1253.48s -> 1260.42s]  Hey, wait a minute. Just as you had that thought, it moved again. Keep looking.
[1260.42s -> 1267.14s]  Congratulations. You found your hand. This may not seem like much of a big discovery,
[1267.14s -> 1271.62s]  but it is. You will have to learn how to control your hands as part of childhood
[1271.62s -> 1276.33s]  development. When you are an adolescent, those hands are going to get you into quite
[1276.33s -> 1287.93s]  a bit of trouble because that requires a different kind of hand control. This is stupid.
[1287.93s -> 1292.57s]  You're lying down in your crib and are greeted by a nosy neighbor who has a child just around
[1292.57s -> 1297.94s]  your age. The neighbor says, my, look at that funny little nose. She turns to your
[1297.94s -> 1302.66s]  mother and adds, don't worry, dear. I hear that noses are the last thing to look truly
[1302.66s -> 1311.86s]  human. She picks you up. Uh, angry and vengeful. Collect a mouthful of drool.
[1311.86s -> 1316.15s]  A nice puddle of saliva has formed on the inside of your mouth. Open your mouth and
[1316.15s -> 1321.83s]  drool on the neighbor. Yeah. Talk about my fucking nose. I'm going to ruin your shirt.
[1324.58s -> 1331.30s]  A gooey stream showers your neighbor's face and hands while you give her a glassy-eyed smile.
[1331.30s -> 1340.38s]  She places you back in the crib and excuses herself. Revenge. Revenge. Revenge. That's
[1340.38s -> 1353.34s]  not revenge. It is. Maybe it is. It's all right. But it didn't feel sweet. It was just fun.
[1353.34s -> 1358.54s]  There should have been, revenge is not sweet, but could be fun if you're a baby sometimes.
[1358.54s -> 1364.54s]  You're lying on the floor of a big room on a soft furry blanket. You are on your back,
[1364.54s -> 1369.18s]  staring at shadows that sometimes creep across the ceiling. Every so often mom or dad passes
[1369.18s -> 1374.92s]  by and makes a funny face. Your hands grope in all directions and your feet pat the floor
[1374.92s -> 1387.19s]  gently, almost out of your control. Happy, sad, mad. Happy and make an O-shape with your mouth.
[1391.45s -> 1396.09s]  You pucker your cheeks in and out and take short, quick breaths. The skin on your face
[1396.09s -> 1404.58s]  feels alternately tight and loose. A person walks by and twirls their fingers at you.
[1404.58s -> 1412.46s]  Turn around towards the person. You are too young to keep the person in view for a long
[1412.46s -> 1417.93s]  time. Whoever it is that moves past in a blur. All right, here we go. We're going to develop
[1417.93s -> 1425.00s]  some brain here. You are lying down in the crib while your mom and dad are speaking in the other
[1425.00s -> 1429.96s]  room. You hear their voices, deep and muffled, from beyond the door. Why aren't they paying
[1429.96s -> 1438.74s]  attention to you? Make noise! Get over here! You begin to cry. This alarms your parents
[1438.74s -> 1444.41s]  and is a negative way of attracting attention. Your dad comes in holding a bottle of warm
[1444.49s -> 1457.08s]  milk which satisfies you temporarily. Uh-oh. Wrong. Wrong choice. You've just awakened from a nice
[1457.08s -> 1464.97s]  long nap. Your mom comes in the room and wants to hold you. I'm a little cranky. I'm a little
[1464.97s -> 1480.38s]  cranky, but I'm still happy. You have made an inappropriate response. What about a sleepy smile?
[1480.38s -> 1485.72s]  I can do that, right? It's a dog's life, isn't it? Nothing to do all day except eat,
[1485.72s -> 1491.08s]  sleep, and wonder what life will be like when you're older. Does life really change after two?
[1492.36s -> 1501.82s]  A dog's life? Am I a dog? Mom is coming closer. Sure. Very good. Eye contact with your caretakers
[1501.82s -> 1506.54s]  is very reinforcing to them. Parents often mistakenly think that it is the children
[1506.54s -> 1512.14s]  who need all the attention. Believe me, parents want it too. Your eye contact with
[1512.14s -> 1519.30s]  her makes her smile. Social and emotional spheres are increasing. Smile back. Smiling
[1519.30s -> 1523.62s]  makes your mom feel especially loving towards you. She brings your face close to her face.
[1523.62s -> 1538.78s]  Your face is touch. Be still or move my mouth. I'm gonna move my mouth. You just gave your first
[1538.78s -> 1544.70s]  kiss. This may not seem like a very big deal to you, but is very important for your mother.
[1544.70s -> 1549.18s]  The bad part is that now you will have to repeat this act until your entire family
[1549.18s -> 1556.73s]  becomes aware of your new talent. You can avoid kissing overly affectionate relatives
[1556.73s -> 1568.71s]  by dribbling on them at just the right moment. What are these? What is this? It's time to go to
[1568.71s -> 1573.91s]  Aunt Lucy's house. It's chilly outside and you need to be dressed in a coverall type suit.
[1576.82s -> 1586.44s]  Go limp! All right, I'm gonna... I don't want to go. I'm gonna go limp. Resist. You react
[1586.44s -> 1591.00s]  against being squeezed into this uncomfortable suit by crying and sending out long sirens
[1591.00s -> 1598.86s]  of protest. Your grandmother graciously offers to help. Cooperate for grandma. Keep giving
[1598.86s -> 1606.28s]  everyone a hard time. Not a very wise choice. How do you expect to motivate grandma to spoil
[1606.28s -> 1611.08s]  you if you are not willing to make your mom look foolish in front of her by persisting
[1611.08s -> 1617.82s]  to act like a little brat? Would you like to give in now or make everyone even angrier with
[1617.82s -> 1629.56s]  you? Your mother pulls you away from your grandmother and literally stuffs you into the
[1629.56s -> 1635.30s]  suit. It is tucked in and bunched up in all the wrong places and you are uncomfortable.
[1635.30s -> 1640.26s]  Your grandmother protests but to no avail. Your mom has the last word and your physical
[1640.26s -> 1647.59s]  sphere suffers temporarily short-term discomfort. I didn't want to go. I didn't want to be put
[1647.59s -> 1656.17s]  in the suit. You're quietly playing with your father's brand new electronic calculator. Look
[1656.17s -> 1664.52s]  the back of it lifts off very easily. Inquisitive. Look but don't touch. Look,
[1664.52s -> 1670.81s]  touch and take apart. Your little fingers make efficient pliers. You pluck out the electronic
[1670.81s -> 1676.65s]  components tasting one or two as you go along. They're definitely not for eating. You know dad
[1676.65s -> 1684.42s]  will be pleased at your fixing his toy. Uh I don't think dad's gonna be happy that his infant
[1684.42s -> 1697.93s]  son is eating small parts of a calculator. Oh that's my son the little Einstein. You
[1697.93s -> 1703.27s]  are exploring the playpen and are feeling very lively. Like a prize fighter you grab hold
[1703.27s -> 1711.51s]  of the playpen bars and shake back and forth flexing your knees. Daring. Determined. Daring.
[1711.51s -> 1718.68s]  Let go of the playpen. You raise your hands over your head triumphantly. Boom! You go right down
[1718.68s -> 1724.68s]  on your bottom. Thank heavens for padded bottoms. You wobble back up standing.
[1725.56s -> 1732.97s]  You wobble back up to standing position. All right. Navigate around the crib holding onto
[1732.97s -> 1740.33s]  the bars. All right we're gonna do this correct. With ballet-like movements you step over
[1740.33s -> 1745.85s]  the musical ball and four stuffed animals. You've perfected this form of locomotion.
[1745.85s -> 1753.32s]  Would you like to let go again? Yes. Boom! Ouch! You crash to the floor like a sack of
[1753.32s -> 1760.60s]  potatoes. Your rear end is beginning to feel sore. You want to try one more time? Yes.
[1760.60s -> 1766.20s]  The thrill of victory. You stumble across the crib like a punch-drunk sailor and firmly grasp
[1766.20s -> 1771.34s]  the rail on the other side. You've taken your first steps. Soon you'll be tripping
[1771.34s -> 1787.85s]  the light fantastic. Chasing women and running away from spankings. What? All right let's...
[1787.85s -> 1791.93s]  Mom and dad are entertaining some friends and you are minding your own business sitting quietly
[1791.93s -> 1797.51s]  in a corner of the room. Suddenly a man with a big nose and a shiny head puts his face right
[1797.51s -> 1805.05s]  up to yours. It said something in a loud voice. Scream in a loud voice. Hit the man
[1805.05s -> 1815.59s]  in the nose. You give him a right to the snoz which feels rough and oily. You are terrified
[1815.59s -> 1820.15s]  and he thinks you are playing with him. Fortunately your dad spots him and ushers him back to the
[1820.15s -> 1833.32s]  to bother people closer to his own age. I had to knock that guy up. I fucking dropped him in one
[1833.32s -> 1847.10s]  punch. Was it a clown? You're sitting in your high chair eating your lunch which consists of
[1847.10s -> 1851.98s]  crackers, strained peas, and a mug of milk. You're just learning how to eat with utensils.
[1857.26s -> 1864.22s]  Escape from the high chair. You will probably do much traveling when you get older. This isn't
[1864.22s -> 1869.90s]  bad provided that you are not traveling to avoid responsibility. You slip out of the chair
[1869.90s -> 1881.78s]  but hit the floor much harder than you expected. I'm getting out of here. Nothing, not even a
[1881.78s -> 1887.30s]  sore bottom, can stop you now. You're headed for daylight. You go for the blocks with the
[1887.30s -> 1894.81s]  speed of a charging buffalo. You encounter a large leg. Bite the leg. Dodge. You fake left
[1894.81s -> 1899.45s]  and move right. What am I, a fucking running back? Your mom is caught temporarily off guard
[1899.45s -> 1905.13s]  and once again you are unobstructed. Your confidence increases even though you are eventually
[1905.13s -> 1915.54s]  caught and dragged back to the high chair. That's too bad. I'm gonna use the spoon.
[1917.75s -> 1921.91s]  Using hatchet-like strokes you pulverize the cracker until it is unrecognizable.
[1923.80s -> 1929.48s]  Yell and pound on the high chair. Quietly sprinkle the crumbs all over the floor. That's
[1929.48s -> 1936.76s]  that one. I would do that one. All the characteristics related to extreme sneakiness
[1936.76s -> 1942.28s]  and hostility have increased. Your actions will not be detected until the next time someone
[1942.28s -> 1950.82s]  sweeps the floor. How do you feel about this? Good. You are even more sneaky and mean than I
[1950.82s -> 1961.83s]  thought. What kind of adult will you turn out to be if you keep this up? I'm not gonna,
[1961.83s -> 1971.96s]  it's not chaotic evil, it's lowkey. While being taken to the park your dad meets an
[1971.96s -> 1977.82s]  old colleague buddy who's wheeling a baby about your age. As the two dads talk you
[1977.90s -> 1990.66s]  casually begin to eye the baby in the other carriage. Curious and different. I wouldn't,
[1990.66s -> 1996.49s]  I don't think I would be aggressive. Very curious. Put your finger near the other baby's face.
[1997.37s -> 2001.35s]  Yeah, I'm just curious. I just want to see what their face feels like. A baby,
[2001.35s -> 2009.80s]  you wonder if it has all the same parts as you. I'm just like, I'm just, I don't even
[2009.80s -> 2014.44s]  know where my hands are going. Just baby face. You poke the other baby right in the eye.
[2014.44s -> 2018.60s]  He starts to cry. Your father is slightly embarrassed. The other dad is worried that
[2018.60s -> 2029.37s]  his little baby is not macho enough to take a little poke. Select an action. Pat the other
[2029.37s -> 2038.63s]  baby to con- why would I know that? I wouldn't know that's what you would do. Leave the baby
[2038.63s -> 2045.80s]  alone. All right, it's okay. I'm sorry. I apologize. It doesn't work. Geez. This kid is
[2045.80s -> 2050.84s]  a crybaby. You are learning that sometimes no matter how nice you are to some people, they
[2050.84s -> 2055.75s]  just don't appreciate it. Your dad moves you away from the other baby and gives you a
[2055.75s -> 2063.43s]  cookie to keep you occupied. At least he appreciates your empathy. So I poked this
[2063.43s -> 2071.98s]  baby in the eye, caused it physical pain, could not believe that I didn't like my
[2073.43s -> 2088.62s]  pat to the head I gave it afterwards, and I got a cookie. Okay, my first x-ray. Up until
[2088.62s -> 2094.07s]  this point in life, Weasley Wabbit, your stuffed toy has been one of your best friends.
[2094.07s -> 2098.55s]  You take him everywhere with you, but he is beginning to get on your on your nerves, I
[2098.55s -> 2105.05s]  thought it said. I don't know, I'm going down this like evil baby path. I didn't think it was
[2105.05s -> 2110.89s]  gonna be like you rip off his head. You take him everywhere with you, but he's beginning to get
[2110.89s -> 2116.33s]  on in years. One of his ears is torn off and a recent eye injury has made his face like
[2116.33s -> 2123.14s]  a little lopsided. It is suggested that Weasley should be retired. You wake up one day to
[2123.14s -> 2133.13s]  discover Weasley has been moved from the place where you last spotted him. Panic, suspicious,
[2133.69s -> 2140.38s]  and seek information. You confront mom with the fact that Weasley was not in the spot where he
[2140.38s -> 2148.70s]  was last deposited. She claims to not have seen him either. You are satisfied with this
[2148.70s -> 2158.09s]  answer, not satisfied with this answer. Where is Weasley Wabbit? Wisely, you persist. This
[2158.09s -> 2163.66s]  time she tells you that Weasley left because he wanted to be with friends who were more like him.
[2163.66s -> 2169.26s]  She tells you that next week you'll have a new visitor, a brand new friend who will be just as
[2169.26s -> 2182.42s]  nice as Weasley. You are not satisfied with that fucking answer. Bravo, don't fall for that
[2182.42s -> 2187.62s]  line of bull. Parents are great at fabricating stories like this when they make mistakes.
[2187.62s -> 2192.66s]  You will not get your Weasley Wabbit back, but your intelligence and perseverance in this
[2192.66s -> 2198.26s]  situation make it harder for your parents to tell you made-up stories to cover their mistakes.
[2198.90s -> 2207.06s]  How tall am I now? You're alone in the kitchen and begin exploring the closets
[2207.06s -> 2217.59s]  and refrigerator. Am I gonna like pull the refrigerator down? This could be bad. All right,
[2217.59s -> 2226.15s]  curious but cautious. Move toward the pantry. All right, adventuring, move toward pantry.
[2226.15s -> 2233.18s]  You swing the pantry door open and see all the beautifully colored jars, boxes, and bottles.
[2233.26s -> 2238.14s]  One jar looks particularly pretty. It is shiny and brown and full of liquid.
[2238.14s -> 2246.14s]  You unscrew the cap and smell what is inside. It smells sweet. No, I don't think I'm gonna drink
[2246.14s -> 2258.18s]  this. You've just avoided a potentially lethal accident. Your good judgment has saved your
[2258.18s -> 2270.38s]  life. You throw up at the pantry door. Jesus Christ. You're touching something smooth and
[2270.38s -> 2281.54s]  shiny. You pat it with your hand a few times. What? It's like the mood. I'm confused. What is it?
[2284.44s -> 2288.84s]  I'm confused, but I'm gonna keep touching it. It's not hot, right? It's not like a stove.
[2290.06s -> 2294.86s]  It is flat and a little cool. Wait a minute. There's a baby in there. Who is that baby?
[2295.86s -> 2300.81s]  What? Oh, it's a mirror. It's me. No, that's someone else.
[2300.81s -> 2311.16s]  I don't know. I'm trying to make them like a weirdo. No, that's you. You are looking at
[2311.16s -> 2318.95s]  yourself in a mirror. Isn't that a beautiful baby? Yes. You really are quite stunning.
[2318.95s -> 2328.98s]  You are developing a positive self-image. All right, cool. It is announced to you
[2328.98s -> 2333.14s]  during a heart-to-heart talk that it's time for you to give up the bottle and
[2333.14s -> 2344.50s]  drink from a glass like a big boy. No. How are you going to show your resistance?
[2347.90s -> 2358.92s]  Cry. Fold your arms and say no. Throw the bottle at mommy. No. A nice strong effort to
[2358.92s -> 2363.64s]  fight for what you believe in. Since you are strong enough to put up such a fuss,
[2363.64s -> 2372.84s]  you're also old enough to get off the bottle. We're gonna have to...
[2376.73s -> 2379.37s]  Yeah, I got baited there. We're gonna have to learn to live without it.
[2380.36s -> 2386.65s]  I'm not gonna suck my thumb. No. Learn to live without it. You'll be tough for a while.
[2386.65s -> 2391.37s]  You'll turn to Super Duck for comfort. Believe me, cold turkey is the best way to do it.
[2391.37s -> 2402.12s]  Good luck. Super Duck a cartoon or something? You're a guest at your friend Billy's house.
[2402.12s -> 2412.79s]  His mom gives you both a box of crayons and two pieces of paper. Artistic. Draw on the paper.
[2412.79s -> 2419.58s]  Draw in general. You draw large circles and swirls with black crayon on the paper. Oops,
[2419.58s -> 2427.75s]  you drew on the expensive tablecloth. Tell Billy about the spot. Cover up the spot. Tell
[2427.75s -> 2438.57s]  Billy's mom about the spot. No. You casually slide the paper over the offending spot where
[2438.57s -> 2444.09s]  it will remain covered and undetected until after you leave. This was the sneaky cowardly
[2444.09s -> 2462.92s]  way out. Cowardly and sneaky. I didn't do it. There was one time where I slept over a
[2462.92s -> 2473.61s]  friend's house and I slept on the couch and I was like, I don't know, maybe like 14 or
[2473.61s -> 2481.83s]  something, 13. I was old and I was like old. So in the middle of the night, I was like,
[2481.83s -> 2487.43s]  I was touching my face and touching my nose and touching the blanket that I had.
[2488.23s -> 2496.81s]  And the next morning after doing that a few times, I got up and realized that I had blood,
[2496.81s -> 2504.65s]  I had like a bloody nose. And then when I didn't even know. And it was like on the
[2504.65s -> 2508.65s]  blanket and I had like a fucking panic attack. I was like, Oh my God, they're
[2508.65s -> 2512.73s]  going to hate me. What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? At first I like folded it up
[2512.73s -> 2515.37s]  a shit load of times and like put it in the corner and I was like, no, I can't do that.
[2515.37s -> 2517.61s]  I have to like, I know they're going to find it. They're going to know it's me.
[2522.50s -> 2531.75s]  Eventually, like I just told, I told my friend, I was like, Hey, did you do it?
[2531.75s -> 2535.99s]  I first tried it, but I put it on him. Did you have like a bloody nose when we were
[2535.99s -> 2546.30s]  sitting on like the couch? No, man. No. Oh, well, um, I, maybe I, it's on there.
[2546.30s -> 2551.10s]  It's not, wait, it is. Oh yeah. Yeah, there is. Okay. Was it you? I don't know. It may be one of
[2551.10s -> 2562.58s]  us. I'd have been me or you. It may have been you. May have been me or you. The coward way out.
[2562.58s -> 2570.09s]  Coward. I did say it was like, who knows? It could have been me. Like I was taking
[2570.09s -> 2574.09s]  blame for it. It was like, it was either like you or it was me. It was me or you.
[2574.09s -> 2577.30s]  It could have been either one of us. It was probably me. It was you. It could have been
[2577.30s -> 2581.70s]  either way. I did it in his mind. He knew, he knew he didn't have a bloody nose. So it
[2581.70s -> 2586.02s]  had to be me. So I gave him the opportunity to think maybe it was him, but it was me. So he
[2586.02s -> 2594.23s]  get, he knew it was me. I'm not the coward way. 34 by the way. I was, this didn't happen last
[2594.23s -> 2603.37s]  week. This happened like 20 fucking years ago. 34. Yeah. 34 by the way. This happened
[2604.33s -> 2615.32s]  last Saturday. All right. You are sitting in a large place and a furry man walks up to you.
[2615.40s -> 2619.37s]  He's walking around you in circles. A furry man.
[2643.93s -> 2646.33s]  I'm going to grab the furry man by the head.
[2657.85s -> 2658.81s]  Oh, no. God.
[2658.89s -> 2660.84s]  What?
[2699.24s -> 2703.70s]  What? This is toddler. No.
[2706.63s -> 2709.91s]  Inquisitive. Ask some questions. Which question would you like to ask?
[2710.23s -> 2722.15s]  Do you have a husband? Do you have a doggie? Mommy said that daddy has a thick skull. Do you?
[2722.15s -> 2731.14s]  I tried very hard to pinch a penny like Aunt Edna, but couldn't. Can you? Mommy said that
[2731.14s -> 2738.33s]  daddy has a thick skull. The lady giggles and mom puts her hand over your mouth and says,
[2739.66s -> 2764.94s]  whack. What? Wait, did you actually get? What? Okay. This is mom. Jesus Christ. Mom is cheating.
[2764.94s -> 2769.82s]  Dad, where's dad? Perhaps you are interested in asking something else. Which question would
[2769.82s -> 2779.61s]  you like to ask? Do you have a doggie? She tells you no, no doggie, only a cat. You
[2779.61s -> 2790.22s]  inform her that daddy said that that's what they cook in the restaurant on the corner.
[2790.22s -> 2801.59s]  What? Where? What's why my parents so fucked? Perhaps you are interested in asking something
[2801.59s -> 2813.82s]  else. Do you have a husband? She tells you that she doesn't have a husband. You are
[2813.82s -> 2817.26s]  alone in your parents' bedroom. There is a shiny silver quarter on the table.
[2818.58s -> 2826.63s]  Honest, dishonest, take the quarter. I'm gonna honestly take the quarter. You have made
[2826.63s -> 2834.34s]  an inappropriate response. What? What do you mean? It's not dishonest if I say I'm taking
[2834.34s -> 2841.94s]  this quarter out loud. It is really questionable as to whether a child your age can tell
[2841.94s -> 2846.90s]  whether something like this is truly right or wrong. You have a vague sense that you
[2846.90s -> 2850.84s]  shouldn't have picked it up. Your mother sees you stash something in your pocket.
[2850.84s -> 2857.72s]  She asks you what you have there. You say nothing or this and hold out the quarter.
[2857.72s -> 2869.10s]  This. You're not so dishonest. In fact, you are being very trustworthy. It was a
[2869.10s -> 2877.30s]  temptation you couldn't resist. You get a big hug for being honest after all. I told you
[2877.30s -> 2883.24s]  I honestly wanted to take it. Hey, we got some weaves and growth here. Daddy says it's
[2883.24s -> 2895.70s]  time to go to bed. Hmm. What time is it though? That's important. Is it seven o'clock,
[2895.70s -> 2904.10s]  eight o'clock? If it was like six o'clock, I'd say no. I probably would be tired. Tired,
[2904.10s -> 2910.47s]  but I don't want to go to bed. Dad tries to bribe you by offering a bedtime story.
[2910.47s -> 2917.06s]  Oh, fucking hell, yeah. You're so tired that the murmur of words puts you right to sleep.
[2917.06s -> 2920.74s]  You don't even remember what the story was about. That's a pretty good deal. Yeah.
[2921.30s -> 2928.09s]  I made out on that one. It's Saturday morning and Dad asks you to help with some chores.
[2928.65s -> 2940.42s]  The Super Duck cartoon hour has just begun. I can't miss Super Duck. It's the best show on TV.
[2941.14s -> 2951.96s]  You're too busy fighting the glue monster with Super Duck. You're oblivious to all
[2951.96s -> 2957.45s]  sights and sounds other than the ones coming from the TV set. Dad tries to encourage you
[2957.45s -> 2965.24s]  away from the TV. Does it work? Of course it doesn't. You're becoming a TV addict at a very
[2965.24s -> 2970.76s]  young age. Before you know it, you will be staying up late watching old odd couple reruns.
[2971.32s -> 2981.70s]  So that's why that happened. I actually, I watch that show. I've seen every episode.
[2981.70s -> 2987.30s]  You're in a sandbox playing with your favorite toy. A larger, stronger child pulls it away from
[2987.30s -> 2997.18s]  you and screams, mine! What the fuck did you just do? Give it back. The child seems much
[2997.18s -> 3001.66s]  stronger than you. He puts three fingers in your mouth and tries to push you away.
[3001.66s -> 3010.79s]  He is holding the metal toy above your head. Bite him. The metal toy comes down right on your
[3010.79s -> 3018.55s]  head. No! Whoa! Crash again. Crash again. You are beginning to feel dizzy. You cry out, crash,
[3018.55s -> 3025.56s]  crash. He finally starts with your head and face uncovered in blood. His mother takes
[3025.56s -> 3030.20s]  him away before either one of your parents can tell what happened. He was a problem child
[3030.20s -> 3034.84s]  with very aggressive tendencies. He's done this to other children too. You were treated unfairly.
[3043.22s -> 3049.10s]  He was smashing the... Did I get the toy back? You know, if I'm in the car right back with the
[3049.10s -> 3056.25s]  toy in my hands. Like slow zoom into my face with some fucking rock music playing. A little
[3056.25s -> 3065.54s]  smirk. Yeah. Time to feed the fish. You punch a small amount of fish food in between your
[3065.54s -> 3071.98s]  fingers and tap on the glass. There is no sign of Gabriella. Who the fuck is Gabriella?
[3071.98s -> 3085.08s]  The fish? Unaffected. Do nothing. That's cold. Look for Gabriella. You put your hand in the
[3085.08s -> 3091.11s]  fish bowl and look for Gabriella. She is stuck under a rock. She is stiff and her eyes are
[3091.11s -> 3101.00s]  puffed out. You think that she might be sick. Oh god. Fucking god. I would... I'm not going
[3101.00s -> 3106.14s]  to take... No, I'm calling for mom on this scenario here. Gabby floats up to the surface
[3106.14s -> 3110.62s]  from under a big gray rock. Her eye seems very puffy and her body is stiff. You are
[3110.62s -> 3120.18s]  relieved to see she hasn't jumped out of the bowl. Ask mom about Gabby. Mom stutters
[3120.18s -> 3124.90s]  through the answers to your questions. She's uncomfortable and sad. Mom explains that
[3125.54s -> 3132.81s]  Gabby can't swim anymore. She's dead. She's gone away. How can that be? She's right there.
[3133.45s -> 3139.14s]  What is dead? You wonder. You are confused. Mom says that Gabby has to be taken out of
[3139.14s -> 3158.17s]  the bowl. Why would you... What would you... Okay. If this is a child, why would you in front of
[3158.17s -> 3166.79s]  this kid flush this down the toilet? No. You do that like you keep her in a box and
[3167.67s -> 3171.99s]  you give her a little thing like, oh, say goodbye. You don't just like flush.
[3191.37s -> 3196.33s]  Keep her in a box. You really can't do that. Gabby will start to smell up the drawer. You
[3196.33s -> 3200.41s]  still don't understand what this is all about, but tomorrow you will start to miss the ritual
[3200.41s -> 3211.67s]  of feeding her. Oh. Keep her in a box in my drawer. I don't know. I'm trying to be nice.
[3213.69s -> 3219.61s]  No. The fish, you can flush that fish. Whatever. But to the child, you say some
[3219.61s -> 3223.21s]  things. You say, oh, we're going to like, we're going to have them go off and I'll take
[3223.21s -> 3231.18s]  them on their next journey. You don't just do that. You are in the back seat of the car
[3231.18s -> 3241.18s]  during a very long ride. Tired. I'm just, I'm just like tired. I don't, I hate long car rides.
[3243.03s -> 3246.79s]  Let's just play a game so I can wake up here. You are too tired to play games. Are you feeling
[3246.79s -> 3251.98s]  less sleepy all of a sudden? Yes. Your mom has taken along some picture books and coloring
[3251.98s -> 3259.83s]  books for you to play with. What would you like to do? Let's just, let's just color.
[3259.83s -> 3264.47s]  Coloring is a solitary activity. You take the book and color in a picture of super duck.
[3265.11s -> 3268.47s]  You've missed an opportunity to have a positive social interaction with your mom.
[3269.37s -> 3272.33s]  Oh, fuck. I really am just like walking myself in here to like media.
[3273.05s -> 3280.33s]  Super duck is becoming more important than mom. Uh-oh. Danger ahead. You are eating
[3280.33s -> 3285.35s]  at the house of one of your parents' friends. You were told by your mother to be on your
[3285.35s -> 3291.45s]  best behavior. Something that you ate has disagreed with you and now you feel very sick.
[3291.45s -> 3302.14s]  Queasy. Ignore it. Throw up and get it over with. Call mom. Try to find the bathroom yourself.
[3302.70s -> 3311.61s]  Throw up and get it. I think we just get it over with here. Throw up into the blankets
[3311.61s -> 3320.02s]  and fold them up. Find a bed first. Throw up and get it over with. Try to find the,
[3320.02s -> 3327.11s]  all right, I'll try to find the bathroom. It is a large unfamiliar house. You find a
[3327.11s -> 3332.25s]  room, but it's not a bathroom. If you get sick here, no one will know.
[3332.41s -> 3337.80s]  Getting sick like that is difficult to hide. You are discovered and everyone feels sorry for you.
[3337.80s -> 3341.64s]  The person who has to clean it up feels less sorry for you than everyone else.
[3341.64s -> 3354.38s]  What? That's like kind of mean. You're still not completely familiar with using the toilet
[3354.38s -> 3359.34s]  that is still quite fascinating to you. You have just finished and you have cleaned yourself
[3359.34s -> 3373.42s]  like a big boy. Watch, watch the toilet paper disappear into the toilet. Make a boat out of
[3373.42s -> 3379.50s]  the toilet. Make a boat out of mom's brush and float it in the bowl. Ah, that sounds like fun.
[3379.50s -> 3387.61s]  Oops, it doesn't float. You can flush the bowl. Get it out with your hands. Flush it quick.
[3391.69s -> 3396.25s]  Woosh! It spins around three times and tries to go down the pipe. It goes halfway down.
[3396.25s -> 3401.61s]  The water slowly rises and spills out of the toilet. Mom rushes in. You stand there
[3401.61s -> 3405.77s]  looking at your mother with your index finger hooked into your bottom lip.
[3406.57s -> 3410.97s]  The cutesy routine doesn't work. You are sent directly to your room.
[3417.00s -> 3423.37s]  Today is dad's birthday and you would like to make him breakfast.
[3423.37s -> 3429.91s]  Extravagant. Let's make an extravagant eggs spread. What kind of eggs do you want to try?
[3429.91s -> 3435.32s]  Scrambled? Fried? Fried eggs. You must think that young children can do a lot.
[3435.32s -> 3439.48s]  The best you can do is throw them in a pot raw and give them to dad,
[3439.48s -> 3453.21s]  which is exactly what you do. He is in bed sleeping. Feed him raw eggs with a spoon.
[3454.14s -> 3458.38s]  Boy, is he surprised. He probably thinks this is going to be the best birthday ever.
[3459.02s -> 3470.26s]  Mom is laughing very hard. Dad's egg is dripping on the bed. The phone rings while daddy is
[3470.26s -> 3480.86s]  ironing a shirt. He must leave you alone in the room with the iron. Helpful. Help dad iron
[3480.86s -> 3490.02s]  the shirt. Don't die here. Don't die. I'm not going to die here. Cautious. Play quietly.
[3491.54s -> 3495.30s]  Dad realizes that you are alone with the hot iron and calls you into him.
[3495.30s -> 3500.49s]  You run into the room and trip over the iron cord. The iron cord falls on the floor and
[3500.49s -> 3504.65s]  burns a hole in the carpet. It is not your fault. Okay, I thought we were getting baited
[3504.65s -> 3513.99s]  there. I thought it was gonna like hit me in the head or something. All right, we're good.
[3516.42s -> 3519.38s]  Dad must get his teeth fixed and you must go with him to the dentist.
[3520.02s -> 3524.87s]  Mom is busy at work and dad couldn't find a sitter. You sit in the waiting room for a very
[3524.87s -> 3532.12s]  very very long time. Dad must run out and put money in the parking meter. Dad sits you
[3532.12s -> 3535.80s]  on the floor, gives you a magazine to leaf through, and tells you to behave.
[3540.79s -> 3546.58s]  Remove your shoes. I don't know why that's funny.
[3548.58s -> 3553.38s]  Now you're feeling a bit more comfortable. A nosy lady spies you from the corner of her eye.
[3553.38s -> 3555.62s]  What's she looking at? Your sock is crooked.
[3557.96s -> 3566.74s]  A mischievous good boy. Ignore the sock and tear pages from the magazine.
[3567.38s -> 3572.12s]  Remove the sock. Funny thing about socks, the way they stretch all the way out before
[3572.12s -> 3579.18s]  they snap off your feet. You decide to take both of them off. The lady looks at you again.
[3579.18s -> 3591.82s]  Where's dad? Climb up on the chair and look out the window. Dad is on his way back in.
[3591.82s -> 3597.50s]  He sees you with no socks and shoes on and feels embarrassed. The busy body lady gives
[3597.50s -> 3610.31s]  him a full report. Walk over and stick your tongue out at her. You give her your worst face
[3610.31s -> 3614.79s]  and get whacked on the bottom lightly by your dad who secretly approves of what you did.
[3615.35s -> 3620.87s]  He buys you a big ice cream when you leave to make up for feeling guilty about patting you
[3620.87s -> 3633.66s]  on the rear. Think about babies and how we just socially accept babies because of the weird
[3633.66s -> 3637.18s]  crazy shit they do. Imagine you went into the dentist office and you're in the waiting room
[3637.82s -> 3642.58s]  and there's like just people there reading magazines. People are getting called in and
[3642.58s -> 3647.66s]  you just take off your shoes and your socks and just like sit around and like start crawling on
[3647.66s -> 3672.65s]  the chair. That's a Chad move. Why? You have just passed through infancy. I've been an infant
[3672.65s -> 3679.96s]  that whole time. A brief look at your life up to this time shows the following. Your family
[3680.04s -> 3685.94s]  life has been positive and nurturing and as a result you have begun to form the critical bonds
[3685.94s -> 3691.82s]  that are important during this phase of life. Physically you have been not a very healthy baby.
[3692.87s -> 3698.79s]  Socially oh this is a long list. Socially during this phase in life nothing much is really
[3698.79s -> 3704.15s]  expected of you. After all you're still much too young to throw a successful cocktail party
[3704.15s -> 3709.11s]  and frankly anyone who still dribbles on himself probably wouldn't make the ideal dinner
[3709.11s -> 3716.15s]  guest. However by now there are some things you should have mastered. Your progress in this area
[3716.15s -> 3723.38s]  shows you've been the type of child who charms the lollipops off people. You've been the type
[3723.38s -> 3730.66s]  of child who is huggable and gets his cheeks pinched by old ladies with bright red lipstick.
[3730.66s -> 3736.87s]  Now regarding your emotional and personality development. I'm doing pretty well. You're not
[3736.87s -> 3740.63s]  exactly the type of child who could be trusted to wash his hands before coming to the dinner
[3740.63s -> 3746.14s]  table. If there is a piece of cake sitting in the refrigerator at noon chances are it will be
[3746.14s -> 3753.66s]  in your tummy by dinner. What's wrong with that? I'm fine. Your thoughtfulness your thoughtfulness
[3753.66s -> 3758.78s]  characteristic really doesn't count for much in this one module. Most children often find
[3758.78s -> 3763.58s]  themselves at the mercy of their whims and impulses. You're allowed to be cranky now.
[3763.58s -> 3770.38s]  People will tolerate it much better than when you are a teenager. Then your whining and carrying
[3770.38s -> 3776.54s]  on will seem more objectionable. One thing about your character that has a tendency to put people
[3776.54s -> 3781.99s]  off is your aggressiveness. You are the type of baby who likes to pull on loose pieces of clothing,
[3781.99s -> 3787.75s]  hair, and any bulbous fleshy object that comes within your reach. You are going to have to
[3787.75s -> 3794.09s]  learn the meaning of make nice. That wraps up your status for the first module. I hope you
[3794.09s -> 3799.05s]  like yourself. If not you can always try to improve yourself in the modules to come. There's
[3802.17s -> 3812.54s]  I'm now a kid. Are we gonna try to make it all the way through this? We're gonna try to actually
[3812.54s -> 3822.79s]  get all the way through. Welcome to childhood. I wonder how many more opportunities there are to
[3822.79s -> 3838.86s]  like die. Well let's at least get through childhood. I need a redemption arc. Practice
[3838.86s -> 3852.95s]  yourself for heaven's sake in little things and thence proceed to greater. I'm now a child.
[3852.95s -> 3857.53s]  Mom has just taken a job that requires her to be away in the morning and early afternoon.
[3857.53s -> 3863.26s]  She decides to enroll you in a nursery school program. Upon your arrival you are greeted by
[3863.26s -> 3868.78s]  another lady with very skinny legs and large round glasses. There are children playing with
[3868.78s -> 3873.42s]  buckets of sand, building blocks, and other activities. There's a small boy sitting in a
[3873.42s -> 3877.58s]  corner with tears streaming from his eyes, a runny nose, and cheeks red from crying.
[3878.38s -> 3891.43s]  Excited. Walk over and try to make friends. Give the lady with the skinny legs a left hook.
[3895.46s -> 3902.68s]  But why punch? No I need to stop my like psycho tendency. Walk over and try to make friends.
[3904.97s -> 3909.05s]  Your excitement is a positive sign that you are trying to adapt to this new environment.
[3909.05s -> 3913.05s]  To realize that your mom will be coming back so you attempt to make friends.
[3913.05s -> 3918.17s]  You see a little boy your age playing in the sand with trucks. What would you like to say to
[3918.17s -> 3926.18s]  him? Hi. Can I play? The little boy interrupts this as a threat. He interprets this as a
[3926.18s -> 3935.13s]  threat to his territory. He holds the truck close to his body. You can ignore him. Ask
[3935.13s -> 3939.77s]  him to play. Let's play! The boy shakes his head back and forth. He wants no part of you.
[3941.50s -> 3951.16s]  What the fuck? I can't even play with some friends? Should have left hooked.
[3951.16s -> 3955.03s]  Your mom is in the bathtub taking a nice relaxing bath. You are playing quietly in
[3955.03s -> 3958.39s]  your room. All of a sudden the doorbell rings. Mom doesn't seem to hear it.
[3960.55s -> 3971.83s]  Hmm nonchalant. Open the door nonchalantly. Don't open the door. All grown up,
[3971.83s -> 3977.30s]  tell mom. You can't be that grown up if you have to rely on mom to answer the doorbell all
[3977.30s -> 3989.62s]  the time. This set of choices doesn't make too much sense. Why? I can't. So you want to be
[3989.62s -> 3998.62s]  just to go oh go open the door to a stranger when my mom's in the bathtub? You have been
[3998.62s -> 4002.78s]  invited to sleep over at your best friend's house. This is your first sleep away experience.
[4004.54s -> 4008.78s]  Reluctance, excitement, mixed feelings. Lie to your friend and tell him you are not allowed.
[4009.42s -> 4014.06s]  Ask your parents that they will still be there when you get back. What? Go to your friend's
[4014.06s -> 4029.91s]  house as soon as possible. Mixed feelings. Mixed feelings but let's go. One way of resolving
[4029.91s -> 4034.71s]  a mixed feeling is to plunge headlong into a risky situation. Although risk taking is
[4034.71s -> 4039.77s]  sometimes a sign of emotional maturity, it can be dangerous if you do not take the time
[4039.77s -> 4045.94s]  to consider the possible consequences. While you are over at your friend's house,
[4045.94s -> 4058.36s]  you become frightened and demand to be taken home at two in the morning. Oh my god. I'm starting
[4058.36s -> 4067.08s]  to get a little soft here. While you are playing quietly in your room, you are strand- you're
[4067.08s -> 4075.72s]  strand-led, startled by loud muffled sounds coming from someplace else. It seems that your
[4075.72s -> 4080.68s]  parents are having a terrible fight over something. Your father's deep voice seems to be shaking
[4080.68s -> 4087.82s]  the whole house. Your mother's piercing screams sound like she's being hurt terribly. What?
[4097.42s -> 4101.83s]  The yelling gets louder and louder then suddenly everything is quiet. When you see your parents,
[4101.83s -> 4106.07s]  later they act as if nothing has happened. Mom's hair is ruffled and she seems to be very
[4106.07s -> 4115.21s]  tired. You can't seem to figure out what has happened or can you? Oh they were having sex.
[4118.65s -> 4129.83s]  Right. I don't know. It was like I looked over here and we're getting like a lot of
[4130.15s -> 4135.99s]  s's. It was like fucking screaming and fear. I don't know. Soon after you sit down for dinner,
[4135.99s -> 4147.74s]  your mother announces that the vegetable of the day is Brussels sprouts. Disgust. Eat the
[4147.74s -> 4151.58s]  Brussels sprouts without protest. Run screaming from the table. Put your finger in your mouth
[4151.58s -> 4165.72s]  and make a gagging sound. Feed the sprouts to your dog. Gudu. Gudu? Gudow? Gudow? Gudow.
[4165.72s -> 4176.38s]  Can dogs eat Brussels sprouts? Somebody look it up. Look up like can I feed? Can dogs eat
[4176.38s -> 4190.34s]  Brussels sprouts? It's important. I would look that up first. That's like not. Is that okay
[4190.34s -> 4197.72s]  for dogs? I'm a dog. I can confirm. Okay. All right. They can but not huge amounts. Okay.
[4197.72s -> 4205.06s]  So they'll be like it was only like two on there. That's not very fair is it? You resented
[4205.06s -> 4210.73s]  having to eat the sprouts yet you forced them on poor old Gudu. Poor Gudu thinks you are
[4210.73s -> 4214.81s]  doing him a favor. He will also think he's doing you a favor when he sleeps in your room later
[4214.81s -> 4234.78s]  tonight. Releasing the gaseous byproducts of his meal for your... of... An exciting movie is on
[4234.78s -> 4239.34s]  television. The whole family is in the living room watching it. You get up to get a drink
[4239.34s -> 4246.10s]  of water and return to find all the good seeds have been taken. Defeated. Sit down quietly in
[4246.10s -> 4260.65s]  a corner. Tell mom the doorbell is ringing. Tell dad the doorbell is ringing. You know
[4260.73s -> 4267.72s]  I'm to be devious here because I had uncles of mine. I'd go over family functions and I'd be
[4267.72s -> 4274.23s]  sitting in a nice comfortable chair and they would come over with a cordless phone in their
[4274.23s -> 4280.95s]  hand and they would have the button pressed. I was like probably 28 and they would have the
[4280.95s -> 4285.83s]  button pressed to show that the power was on on the phone and they would say hey it's it's
[4285.83s -> 4288.79s]  grandma. Can you talk to grandma? Like passing the phone around for grandma. Just like get up
[4288.79s -> 4291.91s]  just like go in the other room and like talk in there and people would fall for it all the time
[4292.47s -> 4301.91s]  and it was like it was the the red power indicator was on the phone like it had to be real
[4301.91s -> 4311.82s]  and by the way I wasn't 28 19 or something I don't know. She falls for it. She rustles to
[4311.82s -> 4317.37s]  the door and then you jump on her seat. When she realizes what you have done she goes over
[4317.37s -> 4326.28s]  and sits on top of dad. Everyone seems a bit happier now. Look at that. Look at what I've
[4326.28s -> 4334.15s]  done. You arrive at the dentist and discover that you have four rather large cavities that
[4334.15s -> 4349.56s]  need to be filled. Block out the sensations with your mind. I'm gonna be brave and I'm gonna block
[4349.56s -> 4357.56s]  it out. Your status sheet suggests that emotionally you are not capable of performing such a feat.
[4357.56s -> 4363.48s]  The pain sneaks into your consciousness but is not unbearable. This experience will toughen
[4363.48s -> 4370.94s]  you for next time. I still did it. I powered through it. I failed the stat check but it's
[4370.94s -> 4377.13s]  alright. Still got it. Why would I how could I die there? What's the death scenario there?
[4377.13s -> 4382.57s]  Your dad has promised that he will fix your bicycle. He's taking a nap so he's not doing
[4382.57s -> 4393.21s]  anything. Now seems like a good time to remind him. Patient and sweet. Tap dad on the shoulder.
[4393.21s -> 4402.79s]  Make the TV loud so he wakes up. I would say put the TV loud and then run out of the room.
[4402.79s -> 4407.94s]  You know slowly put that volume up to a point where it's not ridiculous but it will
[4407.94s -> 4411.98s]  definitely wake them up and then put the changer down and leave the room and then
[4411.98s -> 4416.54s]  you'll wait for them to get up and wait like I don't know maybe two to three minutes
[4416.54s -> 4421.42s]  after you hear them wake up and then like have a jacket on right have like a little jacket on
[4421.42s -> 4432.60s]  and walk in the room unzipping the jacket oh hey it worked now that you've got his attention

[4456.07s -> 4460.63s]  even though you seem helpless dad just rolls over and falls back asleep he mumbles
[4460.63s -> 4475.16s]  later everyone thinks i'm the bad guy one of your playmates is the daughter of your mother's
[4475.16s -> 4481.22s]  friend her name is cindy one day while you and cindy are alone you become very curious

[4497.45s -> 4503.06s]  trucks instead this game can only lead one place and you're not ready for it yet cindy

[4555.29s -> 4558.97s]  while rummaging around in the kitchen drawer you come across a book of matches
[4565.16s -> 4569.32s]  put the book of matches away light one in the kitchen or take the matches to your room
[4569.32s -> 4580.12s]  and close the door put the book of matcury no no no i'm not taking them what if i tell

[4591.78s -> 4596.34s]  match as you strike it you let the flame burn down the shaft of the match then blow it out
[4596.34s -> 4600.34s]  and light another no i didn't say another one the kitchen air soon becomes smoky with a
[4600.34s -> 4605.06s]  pungent sulfur odor the smoke alarm rings and sends your mother scurrying to check
[4605.06s -> 4614.10s]  what's happening you are grounded for a week take them back to your room is definitely a
[4614.10s -> 4622.38s]  death scenario you are in school and the teacher is giving a boring lecture the boy sitting two
[4622.38s -> 4627.34s]  seats away is rolling up a piece of paper and putting it in his mouth using the barrel of
[4627.34s -> 4635.30s]  his pen he spits the paper at the blackboard where it lands with a wet the teacher is furious
[4635.86s -> 4642.50s]  she screams who did this everyone in the class is howling until she promises that if the person
[4642.50s -> 4648.58s]  who did this will not come forward the whole class will get a punishment you are probably
[4648.58s -> 4660.87s]  the only person who saw the true culprit the teacher acknowledges you you can um may it please
[4660.87s -> 4668.95s]  be excused say pointing he was the one who did it a hush falls over the class some of
[4668.95s -> 4673.91s]  the other children's sigh and relief some snicker your anxiety makes you look a little
[4673.91s -> 4692.39s]  nerdish but everyone is thankful i'm taking charge okay i'm taking charge of that scenario
[4692.39s -> 4695.75s]  at school all of your friends are talking about a television program that you could not
[4695.83s -> 4702.90s]  stay up to watch a friend asks if you saw it unashamed say i didn't watch that show say i
[4702.90s -> 4706.92s]  wasn't allowed to see it say yeah i watched it it was really great yeah that's what i would do
[4708.95s -> 4717.74s]  i used to do shit like that all the time you're a confident liar your status sheet suggests
[4717.74s -> 4722.30s]  this is becoming a strong part of your personality for now your dishonesty remains
[4722.30s -> 4743.29s]  undetected actually becoming the real me late late lie and lazy the triple l and a snitch
[4752.20s -> 4756.36s]  you've just been ordered to bed by your parents in the middle of a favorite television show
[4757.72s -> 4760.68s]  angry complain about having to go to bed beg for 10 more minutes
[4761.48s -> 4766.14s]  yeah i would say 10 more minutes the show is almost over and if they said no
[4766.70s -> 4772.54s]  then i would just take a small tv into my bedroom plug it in and put it under the covers and watch
[4772.54s -> 4777.83s]  the show and the second that i heard the of my parents coming towards the door i would fucking
[4777.83s -> 4781.06s]  turn the tv off and pretend i was asleep and they would open the door and check
[4781.78s -> 4789.14s]  begging makes your parents feel guilty they let you stay up 10 more minutes after 10 minutes
[4789.14s -> 4793.86s]  they forgot you are supposed to go to bed and let you stay up for another hour before anyone
[4795.90s -> 4807.29s]  fuck yeah pretty sick that's best scenario there your best friend challenges you to a

[4921.45s -> 4928.79s]  removes the front of dad's sneaker what the foot in the door tech would just open somebody's door
[4929.96s -> 4935.24s]  say that was pretty good but you can only do it twice say maybe it's time to wrap it up for
[4935.24s -> 4944.01s]  today but even you can only do it twice maybe it's time to wrap it up for today oh because

[4964.31s -> 4975.86s]  treat it's not mine leave it alone that must have been very difficult for you considering
[4975.86s -> 4981.86s]  your history of untrustworthy behavior your appreciation for others increases your score in
[4981.86s -> 4991.51s]  trustworthiness social and intellectual areas all right we got a get a scenario here
[4993.35s -> 4997.99s]  while you are outside playing alone a car pulls over to the side of the road

[5054.50s -> 5058.26s]  you've just turned off the television set and your room is pitch dark through the shadows
[5058.26s -> 5063.56s]  you notice that your closet doors open just a crack you can almost see the image of a
[5063.56s -> 5068.84s]  black hooded axe murderer squinting at you through the door he's waiting waiting for
[5068.84s -> 5074.55s]  you to close your eyes and fall asleep in the quiet of the night you can hear his
[5074.55s -> 5080.31s]  hoarse breath making deep gurgling sounds you look away from the door and look back
[5080.31s -> 5088.84s]  it's open a bit farther than it was the last time if you can only make it to the closet
[5088.84s -> 5093.16s]  and shut the door tight you know he won't be able to get out and murder you in your sleep
[5093.96s -> 5099.72s]  the morning light will destroy him so you won't have to worry about seeing him when you wake up

[5135.88s -> 5141.40s]  relaxing night's sleep now only those aliens would stop hovering outside your window waiting
[5141.40s -> 5145.88s]  to suck you up into their spacecraft so they can examine your brain what's wrong with me
[5149.99s -> 5161.62s]  why am i why am i having so many problems your friends are all waiting for you to come out

[10226.78s -> 10231.96s]  hypocritical because your family relationships have been strained in the past they are
[10231.96s -> 10245.94s]  reluctant to accept you as an independent free-thinking person what the fuck while you

[10336.71s -> 10341.67s]  and that any further prying would be inappropriate some people have a way of testing whether a person
[10341.67s -> 10347.02s]  truly wants to help as opposed to those who merely feel it is their obligation to be friends
[10347.02s -> 10351.34s]  by saying that there really isn't anything wrong i think that this was one of those times you
[10351.34s -> 10364.26s]  never find out what was bothering him you're shopping at a drug store it is almost closing
[10364.26s -> 10369.06s]  time the manager is letting the customers out one by one keeping the door locked so no one

[10374.36s -> 10379.00s]  and announces a hold-up he smells heavily of alcohol and it looks like if the gun could be

[11269.16s -> 11276.02s]  it seems as though you are trying to avoid your real feelings there is hesitation and
[11276.02s -> 11281.06s]  confusion that you're not owning up to how good could anyone feel after his girlfriend
[11281.06s -> 11285.14s]  has just said she is leaving to go far away for a relatively long period of time
[11311.13s -> 11315.69s]  and has spent the afternoon with her parents visiting friends of the family when you see

[11377.64s -> 11382.28s]  to hear but it was one of her characteristics when you met her earlier you should examine
[11382.36s -> 11388.17s]  why you would want to stay with someone who you might not trust is it just you being overly
[11388.17s -> 11392.25s]  concerned or is there really a danger that she might abandon you for the first gorgeous

[13227.70s -> 13233.42s]  you to take charge of your life no one wants to let you have the freedom to do what you want
[13233.42s -> 13237.50s]  judging by your progress through life so far your family life has not been very good
[13238.06s -> 13243.50s]  spending time at home is like going to battle at times you aren't sure how you can even
[13243.50s -> 13249.32s]  live there physically you have been not very healthy socially this phase of life does present
[13249.32s -> 13254.94s]  its share of problems most of these problems fall into the category of girls life must have
[13254.94s -> 13262.65s]  been pretty simple before they showed up yeah your social adjustments to this phase of life
[13262.65s -> 13269.82s]  has been remarkable although you do not have a steady girlfriend at the present time there's
[13269.82s -> 13276.44s]  always the next life phase now regarding your emotional development your trustworthiness and
[13276.44s -> 13281.00s]  sense of fair play are commendable you are an honest young man but there's always room
[13281.00s -> 13286.22s]  for improvement a positive aspect of your adolescence is your ability to resist temptation
[13286.54s -> 13291.42s]  not give into your impulses since adolescence is the time for testing limits this can get some
[13291.42s -> 13296.86s]  people into some pretty dangerous situations on the other hand leading too much of a sheltered
[13296.86s -> 13303.59s]  life can be boring you seem to be enjoying most of what you do even though you experience
[13303.59s -> 13308.55s]  the blues in quotes every once in a while it's nice to see that you are not having
[13308.55s -> 13314.28s]  depressed traumatized life even though an occasional explosive outburst is common in most
[13314.28s -> 13319.32s]  adolescents you seem to be having you have everything well under control you seem to be
[13319.32s -> 13324.50s]  sensitive and gentle you certainly have a good head on your shoulders you are not only
[13325.30s -> 13330.26s]  book smart you also have plenty of common sense now that your adolescence is almost over it's
[13330.26s -> 13335.98s]  time to be hurled out there into the abyss of the real world i bet you didn't know that

[15565.43s -> 15571.08s]  is the fact that she damages neither herself nor her immediate surroundings after helga's
[15571.08s -> 15576.47s]  performance she relaxes with the people at the party wearing nothing more than a black g string
[15576.47s -> 15582.15s]  at various intervals during the night she whispers to a different gentleman at the party leaves

[15701.38s -> 15706.10s]  time but notice that bobby and linda are a bit rumbled in appearance it seems like you

[15711.88s -> 15717.00s]  ready for the concert linda is still glassy-eyed from tumbling around the room with bobby
[15717.64s -> 15723.90s]  there's a moment of uncomfortable silence after bobby walks down the hall to the showers
[15723.90s -> 15727.82s]  linda moves close to you and tells you that you have a bad sense of timing
[15728.62s -> 15733.74s]  she leans toward you and inquires if you would like to finish what bobby started
[15744.20s -> 15765.18s]  this game is fucked why every scenario don't do it don't do it don't do it

[15774.92s -> 15787.11s]  into no no not that scenario a friend from high school calls you up in a very serious tone of
[15787.11s -> 15791.85s]  voice she says she needs to speak with you about something right away her life is falling
[15791.85s -> 15804.50s]  apart and you are the only one who can help her um i guess i will sit with that we're gonna
[15804.50s -> 15810.87s]  what's what's going on what's happening you agree to meet her problem is that she has just
[15810.87s -> 15816.23s]  found out that she is pregnant and is confused about what she should do she can't speak with
[15816.23s -> 15821.98s]  her family and her boyfriend has abandoned her what will you suggest to her oh god
[15822.94s -> 15841.83s]  what the fuck we have we this is a conversation you go i would suggest we just got you just you
[15841.83s -> 15848.60s]  just got into town and i would say maybe you should go and start speak to a professional about
[15848.60s -> 15852.44s]  this shit because i don't know does your scenario i haven't probably i haven't talked to you in
[15852.44s -> 15859.18s]  a long time you this is this is this is not i i should have just said i should have just

[15876.79s -> 15880.87s]  a sensitive choice you must have realized that giving anyone such a direct piece of advice on
[15880.87s -> 15884.71s]  the matter as serious as this would surely be a mistake if things didn't turn out well she
[15884.71s -> 15888.87s]  might hold you responsible unfortunately it is often very difficult to help someone in trouble
[15888.87s -> 15894.73s]  sort out his or her true feelings the person may come to rely on your direction she may begin
[15894.73s -> 15899.05s]  to lean on you so that you begin to feel responsible for her even though you do not
[15899.05s -> 15903.61s]  actively try to give her advice well i don't want to say that a person can resolve a crisis
[15903.61s -> 15914.41s]  only by seeking professional help it is often the best way i don't have i need to study
[15914.41s -> 15923.53s]  relationship the thought occurs to you that it might be interesting to travel to a far away
[15923.53s -> 15928.65s]  place for a little while and experience new things someone suggests joining the peace corps
[15928.65s -> 15938.76s]  i think it's gonna take a long time i don't i don't think i would like to do that

[15982.82s -> 15987.46s]  in an agricultural community in an underdeveloped nation there'll be very few any
[15987.46s -> 15992.18s]  if any economic rewards as a matter of fact you will probably lose out financially because
[15992.18s -> 15996.74s]  of what you could have been earning in a more traditional job in this country during the same
[15996.74s -> 16002.58s]  time period what you will lack in monetary reimbursement you will more than make up for
[16002.58s -> 16006.98s]  an emotionally satisfying experiences and the knowledge that you have devoted a small portion
[16006.98s -> 16013.14s]  of your life to helping others before you volunteer your qualifications would have to be
[16013.14s -> 16023.67s]  checked are you interested in joining now that you have decided to join the peace corps

[16414.15s -> 16419.88s]  should be more aware of her behavior leave her alone no it's perfect what a sport you must

[16534.62s -> 16538.79s]  suspicious because you've never seen to be around now you must pick a way to propose

[16616.87s -> 16620.49s]  to find a decent place to live these days you know not that you have thought about some
[16620.49s -> 16624.65s]  of the major preparations the weeks fly by until your wedding date the time that passes
[16624.65s -> 16629.67s]  is crucial and can determine the future success of your entire marriage everyone has their share
[16629.67s -> 16634.87s]  of problems during this time unfortunately this includes you too approximately one week
[16634.87s -> 16645.43s]  before the wedding the following happens an old girlfriend throws herself all over you
[16645.43s -> 16649.67s]  and begs you to run off with her does this make you want to change your mind about the

[16664.25s -> 16669.93s]  memorable occasion unfortunately you get into a car accident on the way to the wedding and

[16717.58s -> 16724.52s]  you both fall asleep tired and exhausted you don't have the typical honeymoon sex experience
[16724.52s -> 16728.09s]  the next morning the two of you get ready to leave for your honeymoon

[16765.58s -> 16768.94s]  any problems you might have experienced on your wedding night are washed away by the
[16768.94s -> 16773.50s]  peacefulness of your surroundings this is the start of a lifetime that will be filled with
[16773.50s -> 16778.94s]  many emotions there is love of course but that will have to be tempered with tolerance
[16779.88s -> 16783.80s]  after all loving someone who loves you in return is easy tolerating her when she
[16783.80s -> 16787.96s]  is moody and irritable is difficult and may mean the difference between staying together
[16787.96s -> 16793.40s]  or falling apart admiration will sometimes be offset by petty jealousy desire for
[16793.40s -> 16798.58s]  companionship will sometimes be replaced by a need for solitude this kind of talk may
[16798.58s -> 16802.74s]  seem premature at this stage of your marriage but within the next two years things will
[16802.74s -> 16815.85s]  start to become very difficult why are you assuming this in the next two years two years
[16818.60s -> 16827.83s]  i'm still 14 all right i gotta hold on i need to take a second i'm like a giggly mess right

[16838.94s -> 16844.36s]  this is not a bad thing but it is reality your ability to adjust to your partner's
[16844.36s -> 16848.28s]  strengths and weaknesses and vice versa will ultimately determine the success of your

[17137.43s -> 17142.01s]  your work seems to be a higher priority your partner doesn't seem to understand this she
[17142.01s -> 17155.19s]  keeps saying you promised it already happened took three days i'm staying home i have to work
[17155.83s -> 17161.06s]  your partner gets very upset at your decision tell her she is not being very considerate

[17179.11s -> 17182.23s]  telling her this because you believe your immediate need to complete your work is more
[17182.23s -> 17187.21s]  important than her immediate need to have you accompany her on a shopping trip the real issue
[17187.21s -> 17191.53s]  had you taken the time to discover it is the fact that your partner feels that you are not
[17191.53s -> 17198.25s]  paying enough attention to her she just wanted to be with you your response to her sounds
[17198.25s -> 17202.49s]  hostile and insensitive your relationship will never last if you keep this up
[17202.73s -> 17215.43s]  while socializing at a friend's party you run into someone you had a terrible crush on in fifth
[17215.43s -> 17220.98s]  grade she looks even better now than she did back then she's with a guy who looks like he
[17220.98s -> 17233.70s]  eats apartment buildings for lunch uh no like sociable uh just say hello you are introduced
[17233.70s -> 17238.98s]  to duke her date who excuses himself to look for something to eat there's a table full of
[17238.98s -> 17245.08s]  food over there that looks unprotected make small talk and excuse yourself bring up the
[17245.08s -> 17249.98s]  fact that you had a terrible crush on her why would i do that i'm married you talk about how
[17249.98s -> 17254.14s]  things have changed and how everyone has grown up since grade school neither of you has kept
[17254.14s -> 17260.23s]  up with anyone the conversation soon runs out of steam and you excuse yourself besides duke is
[17260.23s -> 17266.42s]  returning from battle and may still be a bit hungry you never got a chance to find out
[17266.42s -> 17284.06s]  that it was she who had an even bigger crush on you yes congratulations the rabbit is dead
[17284.06s -> 17292.44s]  what oh your wife is officially pregnant over the course of the next seven months your wife
[17292.44s -> 17298.36s]  experiences stressful cramps water retention and nausea it is a difficult pregnancy for both of you

[17301.96s -> 17314.44s]  think is best what your wife will undergo hypnosis hypnosis for the natural childbirth
[17314.44s -> 17321.35s]  especially with classroom training what would hypnosis do i almost want to click this because
[17321.35s -> 17329.50s]  i have no idea what this fucking does i kind of want to do it i'm doing it this choice is
[17329.50s -> 17333.74s]  an interesting alternative to the other two not all people can be hypnotized about 20 percent
[17333.74s -> 17340.22s]  of us are resistant to hypnosis so there is no guarantee that it will be effective such an
[17340.22s -> 17345.54s]  application is quite extreme and is effective on only about 10 to 15 percent of the people
[17345.54s -> 17351.03s]  who can be hypnotized for childbirth hypnosis is a realistic alternative for many
[17351.03s -> 17357.51s]  the delivery is a difficult one and a cesarean section has to be performed
[17357.51s -> 17361.59s]  there are some tense moments during which you must leave the delivery room
[17361.59s -> 17369.56s]  you pace outside nervously but soon a shrill cry cuts through the silence of the delivery room
[17369.56s -> 17377.27s]  oh my gosh a baby you perform a quick inventory to make sure all the right parts are there

[17407.72s -> 17414.87s]  stressful period for you the result is that the baby is healthy congratulations again here

[17605.46s -> 17608.50s]  up to it you overcome your squeamishness and give in you lie down on the table and wait for
[17608.50s -> 17613.70s]  the nurse to take the blood the nurse is a very thin woman in her mid-30s you notice that
[17613.70s -> 17618.42s]  she wears very thick eyeglasses and her hand shakes a bit she smiles at you and tells you

[17624.10s -> 17630.89s]  be drilling for oil sorry she says as she prepares to go in again oh just a little bit
[17630.89s -> 17635.93s]  of trouble finding a vein after what seems like 20 minutes of unsuccessful probing she grasps
[17635.93s -> 17642.26s]  she gasped into light oh i just realized i'm wearing my reading glasses no wonder i'll just
[17642.26s -> 17650.31s]  put on my working glasses and we'll be fine now all you feel is a little pinprick imagine

[17686.62s -> 17707.82s]  try again later you are in a restaurant with three of your friends and it is time to pay the
[17707.82s -> 17719.00s]  check the bill is 25 dollars allow another five for a tip it's all about money
[17722.66s -> 17728.26s]  generous cautious prudent suggest separate checks wait for someone else to pick up the bill
[17728.90s -> 17733.50s]  eventually the guy to your left offers to pick up the tab but then apologizes saying
[17733.50s -> 17738.28s]  he doesn't have enough cash he checks the cash here at the restaurant and is told that they
[17738.28s -> 17750.90s]  do not accept credit cards everyone must pay for himself your bill is nine dollars you've been
[17750.90s -> 17755.22s]  invited to a party at the home of an acquaintance when you arrive at the party you notice that you
[17755.94s -> 17758.98s]  and your companion have virtually nothing in common with the other people there
[17759.62s -> 17763.14s]  they dress differently they speak differently and listen to a different kind of music
[17763.14s -> 17767.40s]  i'm getting old although you are in the same room as everyone else you seem separate from
[17767.40s -> 17771.26s]  them you have been there almost an hour and still haven't spoken to a single person
[17773.54s -> 17781.26s]  select a mood uh let's get the fuck out of here i guess you feel uncomfortable with the
[17781.26s -> 17784.46s]  difference between yourself and the other people at the party you might have tried
[17784.46s -> 17787.74s]  getting to know some of them a bit better sometimes it is the difference between people
[17787.74s -> 17793.50s]  that make life interesting and exciting what fun would it have been to meet a group of people
[17793.50s -> 17801.59s]  who were nothing more than clones of yourself looking in the mirror one morning you rub your
[17801.59s -> 17812.18s]  upper lip and imagine what it may be like to grow a mustache yeah sure what kind of
[17812.18s -> 17825.86s]  mustache would you like to grow should i have a foo man shoe okay your confidence
[17825.86s -> 17829.78s]  characteristic shows that you are capable of enduring the comments that it will make when
[17829.78s -> 17834.42s]  you change your looks the more sensitive people say things like have you done something
[17834.42s -> 17838.98s]  different with your hair lately the people who aren't as sensitive ask you what that thing
[17838.98s -> 17844.52s]  hanging off your face is it's funny the way a man's life is changed just by deciding not to
[17844.52s -> 17848.76s]  remove something that he never asked for in the first place and can't help growing
[17848.76s -> 17855.37s]  but i made it a foo man shoe you begin to see yourself as a different person more dashing
[17855.37s -> 17860.41s]  perhaps or mysterious you look especially classy during that period before you realize
[17860.41s -> 17864.79s]  that food sticks to facial hair one evening you attend a show with a piece of carrot
[17864.79s -> 17870.38s]  decorating your upper lip that's too bad can we go on a family vacation
[17873.42s -> 17877.82s]  vincent has developed the habit of dashing away from you and running toward the street at
[17877.82s -> 17884.57s]  full speed you have tried everything to prevent this but nothing seems to work while your hands
[17884.57s -> 17889.45s]  are full of heavy grocery bags vincent scoots away from you and nearly gets run over by a car
[17889.45s -> 17902.54s]  which swerves to avoid hitting the baby yell at the baby smack the baby on the butt isn't he
[17902.54s -> 17919.67s]  like fucking not even two months old all these are bad these are all awful yell vincent thinks
[17919.67s -> 17923.51s]  you are playing a game your yelling does little to prevent this from happening again in the
[17923.51s -> 17937.35s]  future oh okay it's searching vincent greets you with a tiny box wrapped up in tissue paper

[21019.70s -> 21024.78s]  you did your boss imagine if it said that you've just walked into a store and there is
[21024.78s -> 21029.21s]  apparently no one around to take your order it seems that the person who should be waiting on
[21029.21s -> 21034.25s]  you has stepped out of sight for a few moments waiting in the store with you is a teenage boy
[21034.25s -> 21039.53s]  about 16 wearing an old t-shirt and a pair of blue jeans he must have arrived a few seconds
[21039.53s -> 21044.49s]  before you he's tapping his foot lightly to the sound of the imaginary rock and roll band
[21044.49s -> 21050.73s]  playing in his head the proprietor steps out from the room at the back of the store makes
[21050.73s -> 21063.27s]  eye contact with you and says may i help you can wait am i concerned about the boy in the store

[21093.82s -> 21101.72s]  with age yes that's one way of rationalizing your behavior that you would probably be the
[21101.72s -> 21105.16s]  first one to complain if a youngster person weren't showing you the courtesy you think
[21105.16s -> 21110.74s]  you deserved how would the younger generation understand courtesy if not by example if he
[21110.74s -> 21120.92s]  had taken your turn you probably would have put up a big fuss your car has to be taken
[21120.92s -> 21127.00s]  in for some minor repair work the work will not cost you any appreciable not a lot of
[21127.00s -> 21138.78s]  money but it will be an inconvenience since you i have a car um do i have a car when did

[21174.22s -> 21186.28s]  service charges of 500 that's great some backbreaking labor has to be done in your
[21186.28s -> 21192.31s]  home over the next few days the chore is unpleasant but important no one who lives
[21192.31s -> 21200.71s]  with you is willing to help to just pay somebody you're determined to avoid this
[21200.71s -> 21204.07s]  kind of strenuous work at this point in your life and why not you have quite a
[21204.07s -> 21208.95s]  bit of money stashed away you can afford it after all you can't take it with you

[21271.64s -> 21286.52s]  30 grand give me a break what during a quiet time you begin to reflect on your life your
[21286.52s -> 21291.32s]  accomplishments and the people around you to whom you have formed attachments you've lived
[21291.32s -> 21296.73s]  the majority of your life and now seems a good time as any to take inventory as you look
[21296.73s -> 21300.17s]  around you find that there are those much younger than you who have accomplished so
[21300.17s -> 21306.41s]  much more you friends who have beautiful wives in large vacation houses in the country you know
[21306.41s -> 21311.11s]  people who have grown up to be great thinkers and scientists there are people living who
[21311.11s -> 21326.65s]  have made great contributions to society but do they have a yacht no that's right i'm fine
[21329.18s -> 21332.86s]  you must be either quite healthy or you are resistant to facing some of the typical worries
[21332.86s -> 21337.50s]  associated with this time of life in case you are interested some of your friends are
[21337.50s -> 21342.94s]  finding themselves terribly ambivalent about their lives right now they're experiencing mood
[21342.94s -> 21348.06s]  swings bouts of guilt shame anxiety panic since you are not experiencing any of these
[21348.62s -> 21353.10s]  it would be inappropriate to offer words of encouragement i hope your outlook remains this
[21353.10s -> 21362.89s]  positive throughout the rest of the game while you are on a sightseeing cruise you hear a
[21362.89s -> 21367.77s]  cry and see a small boy fall over the railing into the water there doesn't seem
[21367.77s -> 21372.33s]  to be enough time to call for help because the boat is moving too quickly jump in the
[21372.33s -> 21377.90s]  water after the kind of calmness this situation requires is not in your personality
[21377.90s -> 21382.98s]  fuck instead of acting calmly you expend energy trying to keep yourself calm and
[21382.98s -> 21388.65s]  neglect the situation at hand panic does have a purpose it mobilizes the body and prepares
[21388.65s -> 21392.81s]  for an extreme situation this would have been a much better response your concern with
[21392.81s -> 21402.89s]  keeping calm interferes with your ability to help the boy you both drown the game's over
[21409.61s -> 21432.17s]  what no no no no i was so close to being old no no no why did i jump in after him

[21531.19s -> 21534.87s]  you finally find one that feels like a dime you reach out and hand it to the young man
[21534.87s -> 21541.69s]  who looks at you quizzically the time the time he keeps saying your hearing is beginning to go

[21695.27s -> 21699.59s]  and hands won't respond to your wishes but instead of feeling frustration you feel great

[22589.06s -> 22594.38s]  can take some of the pressure off your lower body your back then begins to ache a little
[22594.38s -> 22599.42s]  girl with chestnut hair and freckles about eight years old has been watching you wide-eyed
[22599.42s -> 22604.46s]  for the past five minutes not long ago her mother whispered something in her ear to which
[22604.46s -> 22611.16s]  she looked up at you frightened and shook her head no after watching you a bit longer she gets
[22611.16s -> 22619.19s]  up from her seat brushes it off with her tiny hand and steps aside motioning you to sit down
[22619.19s -> 22627.54s]  thank you for the seat you are such a lovely lovely little darling you realize that accepting
[22627.54s -> 22631.94s]  the seat is a sign of neither personal nor emotional weakness is a simple fact of life
[22631.94s -> 22637.42s]  this child is young and in any way stronger than you she doesn't need the seat as you sit the
[22637.42s -> 22641.74s]  relief spreads rapidly through your body though soon your joints will begin to stiffen in this
[22641.74s -> 22654.30s]  seated position the child is looking at you with great relief on her face i need to get
[22654.30s -> 22664.86s]  married can't she pay for the wedding no nope a group of men are getting to the softball

[22671.37s -> 22675.61s]  to dive wow they believe that actively fun and enjoyment are just for the young ones this
[22675.61s -> 22680.25s]  is unfortunate and activity is probably one of the biggest causes of depression among older people
[22680.25s -> 22684.49s]  the other option is i die if you don't do anything you won't interact with anyone
[22684.49s -> 22688.65s]  this brings on loneliness and depression take a few more risks get out there and live a little
[22688.65s -> 22699.59s]  and die and don't live and die at the same exact crossroads here i'm not playing softball
[22700.47s -> 22705.30s]  there's only like nobody's gonna walk up to me and like hand me like a hundred dollar
[22705.30s -> 22711.77s]  bill or something while you're sitting quietly at a party you notice a very pretty very
[22711.85s -> 22715.53s]  slim young woman in a short skirt bend over to pick something up she has dropped on the floor
[22731.11s -> 22738.57s]  would you like to change your mind no i don't want to change my mind i want to live while
[22738.57s -> 22742.57s]  driving the car one day you notice that the turns seem particularly sharp and treacherous
[22747.85s -> 22752.17s]  your reflexes are not good enough to keep up this kind of speed your car begins to swerve
[22752.17s -> 22759.53s]  out of control and skins off the road your car wow uh your car hits a tree and you
[22759.53s -> 22764.33s]  strike your head against the windshield you begin to bleed you're taken to the hospital
[22764.33s -> 22779.54s]  but do not recover oh fuck off why wouldn't you slow down because it's inevitable i can't do it
[22779.54s -> 22808.15s]  i can't i don't i had a five dollar bill in my pocket oh yeah let me just see hold on
[22808.15s -> 22820.09s]  i have one question just one simple question what is the end here what is this how i'm like
[22820.09s -> 22827.94s]  65 can i actually just skip to the end of this game after a long but very relaxing day with a
[22827.94s -> 22834.02s]  deep sigh you climb into bed and sink into the warm cushiony fabric as you drift off feelings
[22834.02s -> 22838.66s]  of intense serenity and well-being overwhelm you pleasant images of childhood visit with
[22838.66s -> 22843.62s]  sweet memories of mom and dad school and growing up the memories flash by your mind's
[22843.62s -> 22851.11s]  eye was startling reality the smell of school on your first day the outfit your very first
[22851.11s -> 22856.15s]  girlfriend wore on your first date you recall places you haven't visited for years in picture
[22856.15s -> 22862.07s]  perfect detail friends and neighbors who have gone on greet you they're filled with excitement
[22862.07s -> 22868.04s]  to see you though you soon realize they are not communicating their joy in words it's almost
[22868.04s -> 22880.38s]  as if this will go on forever okay there's that we got our closure we got our closure
[22880.38s -> 22890.86s]  we didn't like drive into a tree and i had 140 dollars too there you go
[22894.34s -> 22908.20s]  um could have bought a ring could have oh that's it i did it we kind of frankenstein the end

[22932.01s -> 22940.23s]  this was alter ego that was fun that was interesting it's kind of all over the place
[22940.31s -> 22954.22s]  in a way but 1986 you didn't even become god emperor died to softball well i died i jumped
[22954.22s -> 22969.29s]  into the ocean to try to save somebody and we both died that was great died as you lived on

[23005.66s -> 23019.40s]  hours is a good stopping point only one game we beat the whole we did the whole thing but that
[23019.40s -> 23029.59s]  was fun that really was and i am so happy that this we can just do this all the time
[23029.59s -> 23034.52s]  i got sucked into this one but i think for good reason so don't worry we will come back
[23034.52s -> 23040.39s]  to this we will do more we're going to do this probably every saturday or at least like every
[23040.39s -> 23049.00s]  week just in case you know streams don't line up correctly right there's so much personality

[23930.34s -> 23937.14s]  very low think about how many people follow this channel and how many people are on earth
[23937.70s -> 23947.66s]  that's pretty low chance to actually run into those people right in the same community at
[23947.66s -> 23962.78s]  least three six billion out of seven billion yeah no it's i've run into people randomly before
[23965.14s -> 23973.51s]  that wasn't when not at a convention it was like holy shit small world it was cool but

[24084.38s -> 24091.56s]  that sometimes and i do it too pull out a little bit detach yourself from the internet
[24092.20s -> 24100.02s]  go do things work on yourself you know there are you've seen periods where i just
[24100.02s -> 24103.06s]  you know disappear for three four days a week straight two weeks straight
[24104.38s -> 24108.30s]  yeah i think you have to do it you have to keep yourself sort of grounded and check and
[24109.02s -> 24120.42s]  take care of yourself i do agree but thank you so much for the 250 and good luck again

[24171.13s -> 24175.37s]  it alone in fact the only reason you had internet problems was so you could go and
