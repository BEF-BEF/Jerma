[0.00s -> 20.10s]  Oh, you didn't you didn't think we were gonna play every single wonder book game? Let's make a potion.
[20.90s -> 27.38s]  We have the ideal guinea pig there. That is a poor soul. The cure for boils.
[27.90s -> 31.02s]  Alright, so I'm gonna make this potion that he's gonna drink it.
[31.02s -> 34.02s]  If you can make it correctly.
[34.94s -> 36.94s]  Pungent onions.
[37.20s -> 39.20s]  Crushed snake fangs.
[40.02s -> 43.70s]  Pungent onions. Dry nettles, a dash of flubber worm.
[44.42s -> 48.14s]  Nucous and sprinkle of ginger. This is a lot of ingredients.
[49.26s -> 55.10s]  Dude, why don't you just go to CVS and get fucking boil cream. Why do I have to do all this?
[55.54s -> 57.54s]  They make like Neosporin.
[57.54s -> 61.34s]  We have the ideal guinea pig there. That is a poor soul.
[61.34s -> 63.34s]  Oh shit, no, no, no. Go this way.
[63.34s -> 65.34s]  We have the ideal guinea pig there. That is a poor soul. That is a poor soul.
[65.34s -> 67.34s]  Get out of here, Dobby.
[67.34s -> 69.34s]  Get out of here, Dobby.
[69.34s -> 72.34s]  You're tracking mud all over my wonder book. Get out of here, dude.
[72.34s -> 74.34s]  Turn to page three.
[75.34s -> 78.03s]  Dobby, get off the book.
[78.03s -> 80.40s]  Dobby, get out of here.
[80.40s -> 82.77s]  What, page three?
[82.77s -> 86.77s]  Keep an eye on those pictures. They'll always tell you what we're doing next.
[86.77s -> 91.03s]  Ah, a hopping cauldron.
[91.03s -> 93.03s]  A faithful friend.
[93.03s -> 95.03s]  Dobby, get out of the potion.
[95.03s -> 97.03s]  At least until you try mixing flux weed.
[97.03s -> 99.40s]  I don't think he's supposed to be here.
[99.40s -> 102.40s]  Right at it, then hold the move button to start lifting it up.
[103.14s -> 106.13s]  Okay.
[106.13s -> 108.13s]  Am I making a potion?
[108.13s -> 113.13s]  Or am I Looney Tunes-style cooking Dobby in a pot?
[114.13s -> 116.13s]  This is fucked up.
[123.13s -> 125.13s]  This is evil.
[127.13s -> 129.13s]  Get him out. Get him out.
[129.13s -> 132.13s]  Dobby, get out. Get out of the...get out, please.
[134.13s -> 137.13s]  Ooh. Ooh.
[147.13s -> 149.13s]  Say the same line again, please.
[149.87s -> 151.87s]  Oh, that's fine.
[151.87s -> 155.87s]  Scatter those lovingly gathered ingredients everywhere, not to worry.
[155.87s -> 159.87s]  What a mess. Try to get some of it in the cauldron.
[159.87s -> 161.87s]  Oh, that's fine.
[161.87s -> 165.87s]  Scatter those lovingly gathered ingredients everywhere, not to worry.
[165.87s -> 167.87s]  What is in this?
[167.87s -> 169.87s]  Try to get some of it in the cauldron.
[169.87s -> 171.87s]  This thing is still going.
[171.87s -> 175.87s]  You need to be really careful when you're using your chopping tools.
[176.92s -> 180.92s]  Because there's a chance that you might cut yourself.
[182.22s -> 184.22s]  Ooh!
[192.22s -> 195.22s]  Hey, buddy. Who's holding the knife?
[195.22s -> 197.22s]  Okay, I did it right.
[205.81s -> 208.18s]  Yes!
[210.18s -> 212.18s]  ...to clip off some of the nettle.
[212.18s -> 219.33s]  Hold the clipper's clue.
[219.33s -> 225.28s]  For a cure for boils.
[229.23s -> 232.23s]  We still need that ingredient. Pick it up again.
[232.23s -> 242.79s]  It'll cure him.
[242.79s -> 248.96s]  If you don't get him in there, just dunk him a little bit.
[248.96s -> 250.96s]  Come on, Dobby, get in there.
[250.96s -> 258.70s]  Dobby, we're curing your fucking warts.
[258.70s -> 261.70s]  Stop there. That's two figs worth of juice.
[261.70s -> 264.07s]  Put my hand down.
[264.81s -> 266.81s]  There.
[266.81s -> 268.81s]  Oh, dude, he's sucking my blood.
[268.81s -> 270.81s]  Quite ingenious.
[270.81s -> 272.81s]  Oh, how much is he gonna drink?
[272.81s -> 274.81s]  After that close encounter, time to learn more.
[274.81s -> 276.81s]  Okay.
[276.81s -> 278.81s]  I just let these things drink a bunch of my blood.
[278.81s -> 282.98s]  Now I'm gonna kill him, mash him up, and put my blood in this potion.
[282.98s -> 284.98s]  You wanna get arrested?
[284.98s -> 286.98s]  That's how you get arrested.
[286.98s -> 288.98s]  That's how you get the health inspector to be like,
[288.98s -> 292.42s]  You're putting blood in your fucking food? Your blood?
[292.42s -> 296.01s]  My restaurant's gonna be closed.
[296.75s -> 298.75s]  Give them another bash.
[298.75s -> 300.75s]  My blood wasn't green?
[300.75s -> 305.23s]  Go to it!
[305.23s -> 307.23s]  Why is this implying that I had green blood?
[307.23s -> 309.98s]  I don't have green blood?
[309.98s -> 312.35s]  My blood's red.
[312.35s -> 316.35s]  Now we've got a cauldron full of ingredients.
[316.35s -> 319.35s]  All you need is a wave of the wand.
[319.35s -> 321.35s]  To make it into a fish potion.
[321.35s -> 328.20s]  That's it.
[328.20s -> 338.22s]  Your wand, pick up the fish and fling it towards him.
[338.22s -> 343.07s]  That's it.
[343.81s -> 355.52s]  Stupid, that's covered in shrinking solution.
[355.52s -> 357.52s]  He's just a little baby.
[357.52s -> 369.95s]  Well, he certainly won't stop us passing by now.
[369.95s -> 377.42s]  Can this chop?
[377.42s -> 379.42s]  You're too hard.
[379.42s -> 381.42s]  But here it is again, flighty thing.
[381.42s -> 384.48s]  Just keep quiet still now.
[384.48s -> 390.88s]  You know what the most fucked up thing is this entire time?
[390.88s -> 392.88s]  I haven't even had a chance to sample my own material.
[392.88s -> 395.88s]  I haven't even had a chance to drink my own fucking potions?
[395.88s -> 403.93s]  That's changing right now.
[404.67s -> 407.48s]  Whoa, that's spicy.
[407.48s -> 409.48s]  Whoo!
[409.48s -> 412.48s]  At first, I really didn't think I was going to like that.
[412.48s -> 417.73s]  But man, that was pretty tasty.
