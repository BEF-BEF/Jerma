[0.31s -> 14.67s]  Hey, where do we make the cheeseburgers?
[14.67s -> 19.22s]  I love how we each have a different name.
[19.22s -> 22.22s]  Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, stealth. No, no, no, no, no. Do not just start...
[22.22s -> 23.22s]  This is... What are you doing?
[23.22s -> 24.22s]  That's not me.
[24.22s -> 25.22s]  Oh, shit.
[26.22s -> 28.22s]  Why are you Star's girlfriend?
[28.22s -> 29.52s]  No, no.
[29.52s -> 30.52s]  I thought we were doing it at the date.
[30.52s -> 31.52s]  Oh, yeah?
[33.46s -> 34.46s]  Alright, so...
[34.46s -> 36.46s]  I can't control his mouth sensitivity.
[36.46s -> 38.46s]  You have to turn your, like, DPI down.
[38.46s -> 40.46s]  I can't fight my mouth sensitivity.
[40.46s -> 41.46s]  This is so high.
[41.46s -> 46.77s]  Alright, you are seriously, you are seriously messing this whole thing up, you guys.
[46.77s -> 48.77s]  We were supposed to build burgers.
[48.77s -> 51.77s]  You guys are just taking all the ingredients and throwing them all over the place.
[51.77s -> 52.77s]  We got people coming around.
[52.77s -> 53.77s]  They're just putting them on the floor.
[53.77s -> 54.77s]  We have customers.
[54.77s -> 56.20s]  I'm going to say hi.
[56.20s -> 59.20s]  Look, you need to look at, like, the note board to see what we have to do.
[61.98s -> 67.98s]  I'm just watching Star, like, literally just hold his hands out and just hold left to right as he goes down the road.
[69.54s -> 70.54s]  What are you doing?
[73.12s -> 75.12s]  Trying to fix this shit.
[75.12s -> 80.12s]  You have just, like, single-handedly destroyed what we were doing.
[80.12s -> 86.02s]  Can we actually make a burger or are you guys just going to be dipshits this whole time?
[87.33s -> 88.33s]  Look, come out here.
[88.33s -> 89.33s]  You sprint.
[89.33s -> 90.33s]  You can sprint.
[90.33s -> 93.59s]  I figured I'd just change the field of view.
[93.59s -> 94.59s]  There are people out here looking for cheeseburgers.
[94.59s -> 95.59s]  This guy wants a bacon burger.
[95.59s -> 97.59s]  Alright, we got to set this up.
[97.59s -> 98.59s]  This guy wants a bacon burger.
[98.59s -> 99.59s]  This guy wants...
[99.59s -> 100.59s]  There's so many people in here.
[103.18s -> 105.18s]  There's, like, sick people in here.
[105.18s -> 106.18s]  This guy wants a...
[109.67s -> 111.67s]  There is a burger patty.
[111.67s -> 112.67s]  She's not happy.
[113.91s -> 114.91s]  Alright, who wanted the lettuce?
[114.91s -> 116.09s]  No, nobody.
[116.09s -> 117.09s]  Alright, seriously.
[118.09s -> 119.09s]  Meeting.
[119.09s -> 120.09s]  Team meeting.
[120.09s -> 121.90s]  Team meeting.
[121.90s -> 124.08s]  Uh-oh, the manager is displeased.
[124.08s -> 125.08s]  I am not happy.
[125.08s -> 126.08s]  You guys...
[126.08s -> 127.08s]  One of you guys is getting fired.
[128.08s -> 130.96s]  Hey, look at all this stuff on the grill.
[130.96s -> 131.96s]  Yeah, it's all burnt.
[131.96s -> 132.96s]  Go to the front desk.
[132.96s -> 133.96s]  Go to the front.
[133.96s -> 135.33s]  I got a burger.
[135.33s -> 136.33s]  Wait, what do you mean?
[136.33s -> 137.33s]  What are you talking about?
[141.26s -> 142.26s]  No!
[147.29s -> 148.29s]  He took the patty.
[148.29s -> 149.29s]  Catch it.
[149.29s -> 150.29s]  Someone catch it.
[150.29s -> 151.29s]  I caught it.
[151.29s -> 152.29s]  I caught it.
[152.29s -> 153.29s]  And she's still in the restaurant.
[153.29s -> 155.29s]  Oh, there goes the rat.
[155.29s -> 158.13s]  Oh, he snagged it.
[158.13s -> 159.13s]  Oh, no.
[159.13s -> 160.13s]  Look at this trail of rats.
[160.13s -> 162.13s]  Look at the live rats.
[162.13s -> 163.30s]  They're all...
[163.30s -> 164.30s]  It's like a rat fight.
[164.30s -> 166.67s]  They're all going after this one piece of meat.
[166.67s -> 168.67s]  This one guy.
[168.67s -> 170.91s]  Don't let them get away.
[170.91s -> 173.28s]  We are chasing this rat all the way down the street.
[173.28s -> 176.48s]  Come here, you son of a bitch.
[177.48s -> 178.48s]  I got it.
[178.48s -> 180.48s]  I got the rat.
[184.48s -> 186.48s]  Look at all these people just watching.
[186.48s -> 188.30s]  We caught the wrong one.
[188.30s -> 190.30s]  Can we actually play this game?
[190.30s -> 193.05s]  We're not.
[193.05s -> 194.29s]  Hold on.
[194.29s -> 195.29s]  Everyone get in the back.
[195.29s -> 196.29s]  These rats are burned.
[196.29s -> 197.29s]  They are crisp.
[201.00s -> 202.00s]  They're not even...
[202.00s -> 203.00s]  They're dead.
[203.00s -> 204.00s]  They're black.
[204.00s -> 205.00s]  Okay, we can finish the rat burger.
[205.00s -> 207.00s]  I found the patty that they ran away from.
[207.00s -> 209.00s]  All right, get the rat and put it on the bun.
[215.21s -> 218.02s]  I'm crying right now.
[218.02s -> 220.02s]  This is so stupid.
[220.02s -> 222.02s]  Okay, can we please restart this?
[222.02s -> 225.02s]  I don't have any fucking rats everywhere.
[225.02s -> 229.67s]  How do I get the rat?
[229.67s -> 231.67s]  I don't even know how you draw.
[231.67s -> 233.67s]  How do you even control this?
[233.67s -> 235.67s]  I think it screws up in multiplayer.
[239.67s -> 241.67s]  It looks like a two-year-old drawing.
[241.67s -> 243.67s]  You're holding two?
[243.67s -> 244.67s]  All right.
[244.67s -> 246.91s]  All right, follow me, though.
[246.91s -> 248.91s]  There is a prisoner back here.
[248.91s -> 249.91s]  There's a person back here.
[249.91s -> 250.91s]  Oh, my God.
[250.91s -> 251.91s]  You fucking idiot.
[251.91s -> 252.91s]  What are you doing?
[252.91s -> 254.91s]  We just remade this game.
[254.91s -> 255.91s]  Why?
[258.58s -> 261.34s]  You're fired.
[261.34s -> 262.34s]  There's a person.
[262.34s -> 263.34s]  What?
[263.34s -> 264.34s]  There's a guy in here.
[264.34s -> 265.34s]  I know.
[265.34s -> 267.60s]  That's what I was saying.
[267.60s -> 268.60s]  What's wrong with this guy?
[268.60s -> 269.60s]  Can we punch him?
[269.60s -> 270.90s]  He is the rat mama.
[270.90s -> 271.90s]  Can I pick him up?
[271.90s -> 275.78s]  What if you could pick him up and make a person sandwich?
[275.78s -> 276.78s]  No.
[276.78s -> 278.78s]  Oh, no.
[278.78s -> 279.78s]  No.
[279.78s -> 282.78s]  We all conspired against you.
[282.78s -> 284.78s]  Yeah, it's just like all at once.
[284.78s -> 286.78s]  No one said anything.
[286.78s -> 287.78s]  I'm very happy with our teamwork.
[287.78s -> 288.78s]  I am completely lost.
[288.78s -> 290.78s]  There's no way I'm getting out of this.
[290.78s -> 292.78s]  We did that very silently.
[292.78s -> 293.78s]  We all knew.
[293.78s -> 294.78s]  You dicks.
[294.78s -> 297.96s]  It's just me and this weird hermit guy back here now.
[301.10s -> 303.10s]  He's fighting through the shrubbery.
[303.10s -> 305.59s]  I'm fighting through.
[305.59s -> 307.59s]  He's bringing the rats.
[308.59s -> 310.34s]  We're doing it.
[310.34s -> 313.34s]  Also, we're wearing bandanas and look like pirates.
[314.97s -> 317.53s]  Okay, Star, you're not allowed to look.
[317.53s -> 318.53s]  Not allowed to look?
[318.53s -> 319.53s]  No, because you're the burger judge.
[319.53s -> 320.53s]  There's people coming in.
[320.53s -> 321.53s]  There's customers.
[321.53s -> 322.53s]  I'll talk the people down.
[322.53s -> 324.53s]  You got to show them to their seats.
[324.53s -> 325.53s]  I'll lower their expectations.
[325.53s -> 329.53s]  Lower their expectations because they're going to probably throw up after eating one of our burgers.
[329.53s -> 331.22s]  I'm going to go.
[331.22s -> 332.22s]  You look mad.
[332.22s -> 333.22s]  Oh, I picked something up.
[333.22s -> 334.22s]  Yeah, still.
[334.22s -> 335.22s]  We have to make burgers.
[335.22s -> 337.22s]  We have to make our own delicious cheeseburgers.
[337.22s -> 338.84s]  By second rule.
[338.84s -> 339.84s]  By second rule.
[339.84s -> 340.84s]  Start with a bun.
[340.84s -> 344.84s]  Everyone get away from each other because we're just going to knock into stuff.
[344.84s -> 345.84s]  I'll take my stuff into the bathroom.
[348.02s -> 351.02s]  So here's my burger station is going to be right next to the sink.
[351.02s -> 354.02s]  In the bathroom.
[354.02s -> 356.02s]  Yeah, I'll be in the bathroom with my...
[356.02s -> 359.80s]  Oh, well, the cheese is completely...
[359.80s -> 362.80s]  My cheese, seriously, is just like a black tile.
[362.80s -> 363.80s]  You don't put the cheese on the grill.
[363.80s -> 364.80s]  I wanted to like melt it.
[364.80s -> 366.80s]  You don't put the cheese on the grill.
[366.80s -> 368.80s]  Okay, well, get out of my station.
[368.80s -> 372.36s]  You dick.
[372.36s -> 375.36s]  You son of a bitch.
[375.36s -> 378.36s]  He just dropped my burger in the fucking sink.
[378.36s -> 380.79s]  Hey, hey, you don't got to...
[380.79s -> 381.79s]  You got to play to win.
[381.79s -> 382.79s]  Oh my...
[382.79s -> 383.79s]  Where are you from?
[383.79s -> 384.79s]  Never...
[384.79s -> 388.44s]  Star, just pretend like you didn't hear that.
[388.44s -> 391.00s]  What are you doing back here?
[391.00s -> 394.00s]  How are you like multiplying these bacons, Star?
[394.00s -> 395.00s]  Come back here.
[395.00s -> 396.00s]  What?
[396.00s -> 397.00s]  Come back here.
[397.00s -> 398.00s]  What's going on?
[398.00s -> 399.00s]  I know how to break everything.
[399.00s -> 400.00s]  Where are you?
[400.00s -> 401.00s]  It's like duping poop.
[401.00s -> 402.00s]  I'm in the back room.
[402.00s -> 404.58s]  What the hell?
[404.58s -> 406.91s]  How did you get all this bacon?
[406.91s -> 407.91s]  I'm the Baconator.
[407.91s -> 408.91s]  I'm the Baconator.
[408.91s -> 409.91s]  Who's under the ground?
[409.91s -> 410.91s]  Jeremy, you're under the ground.
[410.91s -> 411.91s]  What the fuck?
[411.91s -> 412.91s]  Oh no.
[412.91s -> 413.91s]  What the fuck did you do?
[413.91s -> 414.91s]  No.
[414.91s -> 415.91s]  I'm gone.
[415.91s -> 419.15s]  I was so hard on that.
[419.15s -> 420.15s]  Oh, Phil.
[420.15s -> 421.15s]  Oh, Phil.
[421.15s -> 422.78s]  Where am I?
[422.78s -> 423.78s]  I don't know.
[423.78s -> 424.78s]  I'm...
[424.78s -> 425.78s]  Somebody else fell.
[425.78s -> 426.78s]  Somebody else fell.
[426.78s -> 433.65s]  Who just fell?
[433.65s -> 436.65s]  You went wizened by my screen.
