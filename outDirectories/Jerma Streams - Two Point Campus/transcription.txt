[505.16s -> 507.16s]  That's all the plus twos I got. That's not fair.
[507.16s -> 509.16s]  That's all the plus twos I got. That's not fair.
[509.16s -> 518.42s]  It really isn't. Hold on, let me make sure I get this right.
[518.42s -> 523.03s]  You've farmed plus twos for the last two and a half hours and now they're gone.
[523.03s -> 525.03s]  You've farmed plus twos for the last two and a half hours and now they're gone.
[525.03s -> 530.28s]  No, just everyone wants to give me shit.
[530.28s -> 534.42s]  That's fine.
[534.42s -> 540.18s]  You want to give me shit? That's not a shower.
[540.18s -> 550.15s]  That's the menu.
[550.15s -> 552.15s]  Hi, Professor Jerma. Hey, thanks.
[552.15s -> 558.73s]  Oh, right.
[558.73s -> 562.76s]  Let me make sure I turn this on.
[562.76s -> 566.28s]  It should be on now. Cool.
[566.28s -> 574.02s]  Make sure I turn this on.
[574.02s -> 586.42s]  Okay.
[586.42s -> 590.01s]  Okay.
[590.01s -> 594.15s]  Summa cum laude, here we come. Is that a good one?
[594.15s -> 611.10s]  I think it's pretty good. I think that's fun.
[611.10s -> 626.52s]  That's fun. Alright, but yeah.
[626.52s -> 629.02s]  In all seriousness, no fucking around.
[629.02s -> 631.02s]  We are going to be playing Two Point Campus on stream today.
[631.02s -> 634.66s]  It is going to be an ad stream.
[634.66s -> 637.48s]  It is going to be an ad stream.
[637.48s -> 639.48s]  The game actually looks really fun.
[639.48s -> 643.43s]  I actually want to play it, so it seems like it's pretty fun.
[643.43s -> 646.87s]  Let's go for it.
[646.87s -> 649.82s]  You guys ready? I'm opening it now.
[649.82s -> 660.17s]  I've heard good things.
[660.17s -> 670.79s]  I've heard good things.
[670.79s -> 673.16s]  Was the Black Ops 2 stream sponsored?
[673.16s -> 676.10s]  Why would Black Ops 2 stream be
[676.10s -> 683.46s]  a 10-year-old game?
[683.46s -> 685.46s]  Alright, let me make sure this is still here.
[685.46s -> 691.74s]  So by the same people that made Two Point
[691.74s -> 697.48s]  Hospital, we played that, if you remember.
[697.48s -> 709.30s]  I remember having a good time with that.
[716.33s -> 722.54s]  I'll put the camera on, I promise.
[722.54s -> 726.62s]  Alright, let's go. Alright, let's go.
[726.62s -> 740.04s]  I will put the camera on. See?
[740.04s -> 742.22s]  A man of my word. And I'm freshly
[742.22s -> 744.52s]  showered. And by freshly showered, I mean I threw a little
[744.52s -> 750.33s]  bit of water in my face. And that's it.
[750.33s -> 753.14s]  I definitely look a little less greasy, though, don't you think?
[753.14s -> 759.16s]  I look clean, don't I?
[759.16s -> 764.46s]  I'm ready to go. Are you ready to go?
[764.46s -> 769.64s]  Okay, Two Point Campus. New game?
[769.64s -> 787.61s]  What is going on in the school?
[787.61s -> 795.03s]  Wait, you can be a clown?
[795.03s -> 804.50s]  What is happening here?
[804.50s -> 806.50s]  If I can make a clown college, that is what I'm doing.
[806.50s -> 808.50s]  Without a doubt, that's what I'm doing.
[808.50s -> 819.06s]  Two Point Hospital was fun.
[819.06s -> 825.14s]  I guess you can build the whole campus, too.
[825.14s -> 827.77s]  You can do the whole outdoor area, everything.
[827.77s -> 835.96s]  So, it's gonna be fun.
[835.96s -> 838.52s]  What? Why did that building just shake?
[838.52s -> 841.59s]  Alright, select a member of staff.
[841.59s -> 845.62s]  I'm Albert Crank.
[845.62s -> 847.62s]  Your own per- wait.
[847.62s -> 850.18s]  Unplug this.
[850.18s -> 852.18s]  Your own personal advisor, and I'm here to help.
[852.18s -> 856.34s]  You may or may not have
[856.34s -> 858.34s]  an experience as a campus administrator,
[858.34s -> 860.34s]  but the people at Fresh Lay County
[860.34s -> 862.34s]  College are eager to give you a chance.
[862.34s -> 864.34s]  I didn't scam anybody.
[864.34s -> 867.48s]  I'm not sure what that
[867.48s -> 869.48s]  says about them, but hey, let's head to
[869.48s -> 871.48s]  Fresh Lay Meadows and get started
[871.48s -> 873.91s]  on your academic empire.
[873.91s -> 877.43s]  Hashtag advertising.
[877.43s -> 879.43s]  This actually is probably gonna be fun.
[879.43s -> 881.43s]  Alright, this country-side college has low expectations
[881.43s -> 883.43s]  and a nice canal. It's the perfect place for you to start your career.
[883.43s -> 885.74s]  Alright, let's go.
[885.74s -> 890.22s]  Campus Management 101.
[890.22s -> 898.14s]  Is that the school mascot?
[910.14s -> 912.14s]  Long ago, by dignified
[912.14s -> 914.14s]  people who wore bowler hats
[914.14s -> 916.14s]  and spoke via subtitle,
[916.14s -> 918.14s]  the world is a creation
[918.14s -> 920.14s]  of the past, and it is
[920.14s -> 922.14s]  our job to keep it all going
[922.14s -> 924.14s]  and try not to touch anything.
[926.14s -> 929.77s]  Stewie Griffin. Alright.
[929.77s -> 931.77s]  It looks really nice. The graphics are
[931.77s -> 934.65s]  beautiful. I thought that said
[934.65s -> 937.27s]  Scientology.
[937.27s -> 939.27s]  Alright, first day of school.
[939.27s -> 941.58s]  Welcome to Fresh Lay Meadows,
[941.58s -> 943.58s]  where life moves slowly and expectations
[943.58s -> 945.58s]  are lowly. The two-point
[945.58s -> 947.58s]  countryside is the perfect place to start your career.
[947.58s -> 949.58s]  Learn the ropes, make mistakes, and hit the
[949.58s -> 953.10s]  ground smiling.
[953.10s -> 955.10s]  Scientography.
[955.10s -> 957.27s]  Ten students, alright.
[957.27s -> 963.93s]  Alright, there's no school.
[963.93s -> 966.68s]  It's just an auditorium.
[966.68s -> 968.86s]  Okay, learn the basics of
[968.86s -> 970.86s]  campus management. Try moving the camera
[970.86s -> 972.86s]  and have a look around. You got it? Okay.
[972.86s -> 981.74s]  Okay. Zoom the camera.
[981.74s -> 986.79s]  Pan the camera. Sure.
[986.79s -> 988.79s]  Spin the camera. Pitch the camera.
[988.79s -> 992.31s]  R and F. Oh, okay.
[992.31s -> 996.92s]  He's desync.
[996.92s -> 1002.41s]  Shouldn't be. Okay.
[1002.41s -> 1004.41s]  So our campus is going to be running a Scientography
[1004.41s -> 1006.41s]  course. Let's start by building a science
[1006.41s -> 1010.31s]  lab. Okay. 18,000?
[1010.31s -> 1014.47s]  That sounds fine. Alright, so
[1014.47s -> 1017.22s]  it should probably be in the corner. How big
[1017.22s -> 1019.22s]  should it be?
[1019.22s -> 1023.32s]  Should it be huge?
[1023.32s -> 1026.78s]  I don't think it needs to be that big.
[1026.78s -> 1029.90s]  Five by five? Okay, so
[1029.90s -> 1031.90s]  it's a science lab. Let's put a door here.
[1031.90s -> 1040.39s]  This is actually way too small.
[1040.39s -> 1045.18s]  Okay. I got it.
[1045.18s -> 1047.18s]  Do you want to sell one invalid item?
[1047.18s -> 1050.57s]  Wait, no. What? What's invalid?
[1050.57s -> 1053.77s]  Make the entire school a
[1053.77s -> 1059.66s]  cafeteria.
[1059.66s -> 1062.73s]  Yeah? Okay, cool. There we go.
[1062.73s -> 1067.66s]  Let's hire a teacher.
[1067.66s -> 1074.95s]  The dabbing. Okay.
[1074.95s -> 1076.95s]  Toby Eastgate is going to be our Scientography
[1076.95s -> 1078.95s]  streamer.
[1078.95s -> 1080.95s]  Streamer.
[1080.95s -> 1082.95s]  I can't speech jam myself with this audio.
[1082.95s -> 1085.77s]  Okay. 70%
[1085.77s -> 1088.07s]  teaching skill. Excellent personal
[1088.07s -> 1090.07s]  hygiene. Toilet comfort
[1090.07s -> 1092.07s]  decreases slower than most.
[1092.07s -> 1094.38s]  Dives head first. Alright.
[1098.34s -> 1104.68s]  Did you say he can't work
[1104.68s -> 1106.68s]  in the science lab?
[1108.68s -> 1110.68s]  Wait, we only have one course?
[1116.68s -> 1118.68s]  Where's he going?
[1118.68s -> 1121.69s]  Where are you going?
[1121.69s -> 1130.38s]  Where are you going? We have to start the
[1130.38s -> 1133.06s]  school year.
[1135.50s -> 1140.15s]  Where's this guy going?
[1140.15s -> 1142.15s]  The students are about to arrive and this guy is walking
[1142.15s -> 1144.15s]  around on acid in the front lawn.
[1144.15s -> 1153.42s]  Here come the students.
[1153.42s -> 1156.81s]  Oh, hold on.
[1156.81s -> 1162.82s]  There we go. Okay.
[1162.82s -> 1167.18s]  Why are we all going the long way?
[1167.18s -> 1171.66s]  That's easier to go in there. Oh, I guess
[1171.66s -> 1173.66s]  it's closer. He's the teacher. It's closer.
[1173.66s -> 1180.42s]  Okay. Wait.
[1180.42s -> 1182.42s]  Do we do the class in here?
[1182.42s -> 1188.17s]  What's this for?
[1188.17s -> 1195.00s]  There are no seats.
[1195.00s -> 1197.00s]  Oh, okay. Here they go. They're in their first class.
[1197.00s -> 1202.81s]  First day.
[1202.81s -> 1208.95s]  There's no place to sit down. Hey,
[1208.95s -> 1216.95s]  put those down. This is dangerous.
[1216.95s -> 1225.46s]  We just make cubes?
[1225.46s -> 1227.46s]  There are no seats and there's no desks.
[1227.46s -> 1231.18s]  Okay. The students
[1231.18s -> 1233.54s]  learn experience points.
[1233.54s -> 1235.54s]  Increase their academic level.
[1235.54s -> 1241.37s]  Okay. Where's the teacher?
[1241.37s -> 1245.85s]  What are they making? They're making
[1245.85s -> 1249.37s]  gas. That's not
[1249.37s -> 1253.46s]  normal. Oh, by the way,
[1253.46s -> 1255.46s]  Two Point Campus is across all major platforms.
[1255.46s -> 1257.46s]  You can get it on
[1257.46s -> 1259.46s]  PC. You can get it on PlayStation.
[1259.46s -> 1261.46s]  You can get it on Xbox. You can get it on
[1261.46s -> 1269.59s]  everything. All right. So it's almost done.
[1269.59s -> 1273.69s]  Almost more than any gloves.
[1273.69s -> 1283.93s]  Feels fine. Squeaky clean. Iron
[1283.93s -> 1285.93s]  blood.
[1291.93s -> 1294.30s]  Did you get chin extensions?
[1294.30s -> 1296.30s]  Yeah.
[1308.30s -> 1310.30s]  This camera sucks,
[1310.30s -> 1312.47s]  okay?
[1312.47s -> 1314.47s]  Okay. Class is over.
[1314.47s -> 1316.47s]  They passed the
[1316.47s -> 1318.47s]  first class. Sadly,
[1318.47s -> 1320.47s]  they didn't do all that well. It seems a number of them
[1320.47s -> 1322.47s]  were distracted by one
[1322.47s -> 1324.47s]  need or another. What?
[1324.47s -> 1326.97s]  What are they doing?
[1346.57s -> 1348.57s]  Okay. Take a look at our campus.
[1348.57s -> 1350.57s]  Take a look at our students
[1350.57s -> 1352.57s]  and see what we can do to improve the campus.
[1352.57s -> 1359.22s]  Stop making me feel
[1359.22s -> 1361.22s]  jealous by telling me how many consoles this game is on.
[1361.22s -> 1363.22s]  I only own two, and you're making me feel
[1363.22s -> 1365.22s]  jealous of other people's possessions.
[1365.22s -> 1367.22s]  Bro, you own two of the
[1367.22s -> 1369.22s]  current gen consoles?
[1369.22s -> 1373.13s]  What?
[1373.13s -> 1375.62s]  Okay. Okay. We need
[1375.62s -> 1377.62s]  bathroom.
[1377.62s -> 1380.76s]  Tired?
[1380.76s -> 1382.76s]  The key to campus hospitality is remember that
[1382.76s -> 1384.76s]  three Rs. Students need somewhere
[1384.76s -> 1386.76s]  to relax, rest themselves,
[1386.76s -> 1389.00s]  and relieve themselves. Sure, two of those
[1389.00s -> 1391.00s]  might be the same thing, but it does sound convincing.
[1391.00s -> 1393.00s]  Let's build a dormitory
[1393.00s -> 1395.00s]  and a bathroom to keep people comfortable.
[1395.00s -> 1398.18s]  This poor kid.
[1398.18s -> 1400.18s]  Okay, I need to build a dorm.
[1400.18s -> 1402.62s]  Build a dorm.
[1402.62s -> 1408.95s]  Dormitory. How big?
[1408.95s -> 1414.07s]  It's got to be big, right?
[1414.07s -> 1418.81s]  Can I make the campus bigger? It's got to be
[1418.81s -> 1424.70s]  a lot. Shit.
[1424.70s -> 1428.47s]  How do I fix that? I need to fix that.
[1428.47s -> 1435.56s]  Okay.
[1437.56s -> 1441.46s]  Okay, place an item.
[1441.46s -> 1466.79s]  You can rotate it. Okay.
[1466.79s -> 1470.06s]  This is like a fucking hospital.
[1478.36s -> 1480.36s]  Turning into a barracks.
[1480.36s -> 1484.52s]  How many beds do I have to have?
[1484.52s -> 1486.52s]  What?
[1486.52s -> 1488.52s]  Okay. Okay. Okay.
[1488.52s -> 1493.90s]  Oh, shit. I thought it was
[1493.90s -> 1495.90s]  tutorialing me.
[1495.90s -> 1497.90s]  I thought I was getting tutorialed.
[1497.90s -> 1499.90s]  Because remember I put the door down.
[1499.90s -> 1501.90s]  I put the wardrobe down.
[1501.90s -> 1503.90s]  It selected it for me.
[1509.90s -> 1511.90s]  Okay.
[1513.90s -> 1515.90s]  I need an ATM.
[1517.90s -> 1519.90s]  Everybody gets a hand sanitizer
[1519.90s -> 1521.90s]  next to their bed.
[1527.90s -> 1529.90s]  Where's the bathroom?
[1531.90s -> 1537.59s]  Alright, where's the bathroom?
[1537.59s -> 1543.03s]  Do not cancel this room.
[1543.03s -> 1545.40s]  Okay, we good?
[1545.40s -> 1551.22s]  Wormitory is a great place for students to relax
[1551.22s -> 1553.22s]  when they're low on energy. One bed between
[1553.22s -> 1555.22s]  five students is considered normal on
[1555.22s -> 1560.92s]  campus. What?
[1560.92s -> 1575.37s]  Okay. Students may dream
[1575.37s -> 1577.37s]  of having their own bed, but they'll happily
[1577.37s -> 1579.37s]  share with a few friends. What are you talking
[1579.37s -> 1584.49s]  about? They don't get it at the same
[1584.49s -> 1587.94s]  time. Who gets into
[1587.94s -> 1590.18s]  a bed like that?
[1590.18s -> 1592.18s]  That's a weird
[1592.18s -> 1594.18s]  person. That's a weird
[1594.18s -> 1596.18s]  person. Who gets into a bed
[1596.18s -> 1598.18s]  long ways? Nobody.
[1598.18s -> 1602.34s]  Oh, there's only one wardrobe.
[1602.34s -> 1604.34s]  Why are there bones in there?
[1604.34s -> 1606.34s]  Why is there a dead body in there?
[1606.34s -> 1609.29s]  Why is there a dead body in there?
[1609.29s -> 1611.72s]  Alright, hold on. I'm confused.
[1611.72s -> 1622.47s]  I need a bathroom.
[1622.47s -> 1634.94s]  Okay. Sink.
[1634.94s -> 1638.26s]  Okay.
[1638.26s -> 1642.04s]  Hand dryer.
[1642.04s -> 1645.88s]  Plant. Hand sanitizations.
[1645.88s -> 1648.82s]  Okay.
[1648.82s -> 1651.90s]  And a window. No!
[1651.90s -> 1653.90s]  A window?
[1653.90s -> 1655.90s]  Put in some slot machines.
[1655.90s -> 1658.52s]  Okay.
[1658.52s -> 1663.06s]  Bathroom done. New room
[1663.06s -> 1667.86s]  unlocked. Shower room. Did you
[1667.86s -> 1670.68s]  hear that? I think our students might be hungry.
[1670.68s -> 1672.68s]  Originally, campuses offer a range of
[1672.68s -> 1674.68s]  food and drink to, you know, sustain life.
[1674.68s -> 1683.19s]  Let's add some vending machines.
[1683.19s -> 1690.28s]  I think I didn't make it.
[1690.28s -> 1692.28s]  Wait, you just went to the bathroom. Why are you still
[1692.28s -> 1694.28s]  holding your stomach?
[1694.28s -> 1697.29s]  This person...
[1697.29s -> 1699.29s]  Why are they doing this?
[1699.29s -> 1701.29s]  Why does everybody have diarrhea?
[1701.29s -> 1704.49s]  What happened?
[1704.49s -> 1708.01s]  Everyone's holding their stomachs?
[1708.01s -> 1710.01s]  Oh, they're hungry. Okay. Right, right, right, right.
[1710.01s -> 1713.59s]  That's my bed. Okay.
[1713.59s -> 1720.25s]  How do I get food?
[1720.25s -> 1722.42s]  Oh, okay. Here we go.
[1722.42s -> 1724.42s]  Cheesy gubbins machine.
[1729.27s -> 1731.27s]  I don't have to go far.
[1746.01s -> 1749.02s]  Alright. If we were up to the students,
[1749.02s -> 1751.02s]  I'm sure we'd be all living in our own filth.
[1751.02s -> 1753.02s]  We have very little say in the matter.
[1753.02s -> 1755.90s]  Let's hire a janitor and place a bin.
[1755.90s -> 1761.34s]  Okay. Jackie
[1761.34s -> 1763.70s]  Clear. Wait, these are teachers.
[1763.70s -> 1766.26s]  Jeff Vacuum.
[1766.26s -> 1768.26s]  That's a great, great janitor name.
[1768.26s -> 1770.70s]  Jeff Vacuum.
[1770.70s -> 1772.70s]  I think is the one that we
[1772.70s -> 1780.18s]  hire. Okay.
[1780.18s -> 1782.18s]  There's a drink stand right here. You're good.
[1782.18s -> 1787.75s]  You're fine. Okay, so.
[1787.75s -> 1790.38s]  Place one bin. Alright, you got it.
[1790.38s -> 1802.86s]  No one authorized
[1802.86s -> 1814.31s]  talking? Okay.
[1814.31s -> 1821.10s]  Let's see how the students do in the next class.
[1821.10s -> 1823.10s]  Oh, shit. Alright, we're doing a lecture.
[1823.10s -> 1834.55s]  Pass a Scientography
[1834.55s -> 1836.55s]  class with a C+.
[1836.55s -> 1841.72s]  What do you got for grades?
[1841.72s -> 1843.72s]  Bursting. Feeling
[1843.72s -> 1845.72s]  freshly. Peckish, thirsty, tired,
[1845.72s -> 1848.02s]  bursting, and bored.
[1848.02s -> 1856.28s]  Oh. Where are the rest of the students?
[1856.28s -> 1869.08s]  Absolutely
[1869.08s -> 1871.38s]  bursting.
[1871.38s -> 1873.38s]  Tired, peckish, and thirsty. So
[1873.38s -> 1879.91s]  go to the bathroom.
[1879.91s -> 1881.91s]  That's funny that there's bursting and absolutely
[1881.91s -> 1884.34s]  bursting. That's different.
[1884.34s -> 1891.58s]  It's in the books.
[1891.58s -> 1896.18s]  Everyone's sleeping in the same
[1896.18s -> 1901.05s]  two beds.
[1901.05s -> 1903.05s]  They're just sharing these two beds. I don't need
[1903.05s -> 1910.09s]  these many. Okay.
[1910.09s -> 1912.09s]  Who are you?
[1912.09s -> 1914.09s]  This is the class clown. Makes things
[1914.09s -> 1916.09s]  nice and cheery with a steady stream of jokes
[1916.09s -> 1918.09s]  and slapstick delights.
[1918.09s -> 1920.09s]  The class is just an audience that keeps coming back.
[1920.09s -> 1922.26s]  Keeps people entertained and has
[1922.26s -> 1926.68s]  poor hygiene. I love
[1926.68s -> 1931.48s]  this guy. Let's see. Tell me a joke.
[1931.48s -> 1934.62s]  Oh, there we go.
[1934.62s -> 1936.98s]  The better they do, the more money you'll have
[1936.98s -> 1938.98s]  to fund the campus who's smart now.
[1938.98s -> 1940.98s]  Yes, you get tuition
[1940.98s -> 1942.98s]  fees from all students enrolled in courses at the campus
[1942.98s -> 1944.98s]  as well as a bonus for how much XP they're earning.
[1944.98s -> 1946.98s]  Sick.
[1946.98s -> 1949.16s]  All right.
[1949.16s -> 1951.16s]  What? Studying.
[1951.16s -> 1953.16s]  Okay.
[1953.16s -> 1955.16s]  I need a place to study. Completing
[1955.16s -> 1957.16s]  assignments is a great way for students to earn XP
[1957.16s -> 1959.16s]  away from the classroom, but it looks like they
[1959.16s -> 1961.16s]  need...
[1963.16s -> 1968.15s]  Are they throwing just trash down
[1968.15s -> 1974.49s]  on the ground here?
[1974.49s -> 1976.49s]  You're a faculty, man. Pick that up.
[1976.49s -> 1978.49s]  You're setting a really bad example for all these fucking
[1978.49s -> 1981.05s]  kids. What are you doing?
[1981.05s -> 1985.02s]  Why would you do that? Okay.
[1985.02s -> 1987.02s]  Check your inbox
[1987.02s -> 1991.67s]  to see what they need.
[1991.67s -> 1994.30s]  All right. This is the check on
[1994.30s -> 1996.30s]  requests. Library requested.
[1996.30s -> 1999.43s]  Okay. Henrietta Belcher
[1999.43s -> 2001.43s]  has requested a library.
[2001.43s -> 2003.43s]  And nine people have agreed on Facebook.
[2003.43s -> 2010.34s]  Or whatever social media.
[2010.34s -> 2021.93s]  I'm running out of room.
[2026.39s -> 2028.39s]  How do I make the room bigger? How do I make this room bigger?
[2028.39s -> 2035.80s]  Try it again.
[2035.80s -> 2041.56s]  Library. That looks good.
[2041.56s -> 2045.02s]  All right. Let's put this here.
[2045.02s -> 2048.66s]  There. See?
[2048.66s -> 2051.54s]  See how it's doing it? Okay.
[2051.54s -> 2053.54s]  I got everything I need. I'll do one more bookshelf over here.
[2053.54s -> 2057.38s]  And...
[2057.38s -> 2059.38s]  Hand sanitizer. And a trash can.
[2059.38s -> 2064.30s]  And...
[2064.30s -> 2068.58s]  That's good. All right. Completing
[2068.58s -> 2070.58s]  assignment in the library. You got it.
[2070.58s -> 2076.90s]  What's that icon? Can I just sell all this stuff?
[2076.90s -> 2078.90s]  I don't... I mean...
[2078.90s -> 2086.95s]  Oh, this dormitory sucks.
[2086.95s -> 2088.95s]  I can't believe they're removing the beds.
[2088.95s -> 2091.38s]  Oh, what's that?
[2091.38s -> 2093.38s]  We're all sleeping in the same two beds.
[2093.38s -> 2095.38s]  And we have... These have been like
[2095.38s -> 2097.38s]  fresh, cleaned
[2097.38s -> 2099.38s]  beds that no one's touched.
[2099.38s -> 2108.52s]  And I'm getting points removed for that.
[2108.52s -> 2113.96s]  Move this. That's fine.
[2113.96s -> 2118.82s]  I'm gonna pull the room over a little.
[2118.82s -> 2120.82s]  It doesn't have to be this big.
[2120.82s -> 2128.23s]  What? Oh, it's
[2128.23s -> 2130.23s]  a copy. I thought it was move.
[2130.23s -> 2132.54s]  Okay.
[2148.54s -> 2150.54s]  Okay, now I'm gonna... Let's edit this building.
[2152.54s -> 2154.54s]  I wanna pull this in.
[2154.54s -> 2156.54s]  I wanna pull it in.
[2158.54s -> 2160.54s]  I wanna pull this in.
[2160.54s -> 2162.54s]  Like that, right?
[2162.54s -> 2166.12s]  Subtract, right?
[2166.12s -> 2168.12s]  All right. Subtract it.
[2168.12s -> 2170.12s]  Much better. All right. That's fine.
[2170.12s -> 2174.47s]  That's more realistic now.
[2174.47s -> 2176.47s]  Those don't very much room for whatever.
[2176.47s -> 2179.80s]  Maybe like a food place or something?
[2179.80s -> 2181.80s]  Get the banner?
[2181.80s -> 2185.19s]  Okay, I need to hire an assistant.
[2185.19s -> 2187.56s]  Open the hire staff menu to view
[2187.56s -> 2189.56s]  applicants.
[2189.56s -> 2192.38s]  Full of staff for different jobs. New applicants will apply.
[2192.38s -> 2194.38s]  Okay, so I need an assistant.
[2194.38s -> 2199.43s]  Assistant.
[2199.43s -> 2204.81s]  Oh, that's for the library. Shit, okay.
[2204.81s -> 2206.81s]  Okay, makes...
[2206.81s -> 2208.81s]  Happiness brings happiness. What does this bring?
[2208.81s -> 2211.35s]  Comedic timing? Yeah.
[2211.35s -> 2214.55s]  Moves fast and is really clean.
[2214.55s -> 2221.51s]  Yeah, for sure.
[2221.51s -> 2223.69s]  All right, okay. You're good.
[2223.69s -> 2226.70s]  Open the library.
[2229.45s -> 2233.16s]  Oh, there he is.
[2233.16s -> 2235.16s]  All right, we gotta make sure this... We gotta make sure this student
[2235.16s -> 2239.58s]  gets an A+.
[2239.58s -> 2241.58s]  Some of our students are completing an assignment in the library.
[2241.58s -> 2243.75s]  Great way to earn XP outside the classroom.
[2243.75s -> 2247.66s]  Cool. What's your schedule?
[2247.66s -> 2252.52s]  You got science here?
[2252.52s -> 2255.34s]  In January? Hold on.
[2255.34s -> 2258.54s]  You have one class in January.
[2258.54s -> 2260.97s]  And...
[2260.97s -> 2262.97s]  You're just gonna stay here from like
[2262.97s -> 2264.97s]  August through July?
[2264.97s -> 2267.53s]  A full year? You got one class?
[2267.53s -> 2272.07s]  I need more than one class.
[2272.07s -> 2274.07s]  No wonder everyone's walking around aimlessly.
[2274.07s -> 2276.07s]  There's only one piece of curriculum and one teacher.
[2276.07s -> 2280.42s]  Oh, shit. All right.
[2280.42s -> 2283.43s]  There's only one class.
[2283.43s -> 2285.43s]  Stay on campus for a year.
[2285.43s -> 2287.43s]  You know, and go to class for one week.
[2289.43s -> 2294.36s]  All right, let's go. It's a tutorial.
[2294.36s -> 2297.24s]  So, where do we get to build our own shit?
[2297.24s -> 2301.46s]  Apparently, there's a relationship system.
[2301.46s -> 2304.15s]  Which, I wonder how that works.
[2304.15s -> 2306.15s]  I'm very curious.
[2306.15s -> 2313.26s]  The bathroom's bigger than the library.
[2313.26s -> 2320.41s]  Yeah. Everybody needs to go to the bathroom.
[2320.41s -> 2322.84s]  Everybody doesn't study.
[2322.84s -> 2325.53s]  Do you need me to explain that further?
[2325.53s -> 2334.81s]  Maybe you should... All right. Pass a sign...
[2334.81s -> 2336.81s]  I keep...
[2336.81s -> 2338.81s]  Intography class.
[2338.81s -> 2341.05s]  They're gonna get a B. Look, they're doing pretty good.
[2341.05s -> 2343.05s]  Oh, wait. There's the Joker.
[2343.05s -> 2358.71s]  What's wrong? What'd he do?
[2358.71s -> 2360.71s]  What did he do?
[2366.71s -> 2368.71s]  What did he do? Why did he say free?
[2372.71s -> 2374.71s]  I don't get it. What happened?
[2380.71s -> 2382.71s]  Oh, they're bored.
[2382.71s -> 2384.71s]  Bored.
[2384.71s -> 2386.71s]  Just get a B and we'll be fine.
[2386.71s -> 2394.65s]  Hired.
[2394.65s -> 2400.92s]  How do I make a... Is there a...
[2400.92s -> 2402.92s]  Do the teachers go home?
[2402.92s -> 2407.14s]  Statement, okay.
[2407.14s -> 2409.58s]  Tuition fees, rent, XP bonus,
[2409.58s -> 2411.58s]  and then staff wages. All right, cool.
[2411.58s -> 2413.58s]  Seven grand.
[2413.58s -> 2415.94s]  All right, we're good.
[2417.94s -> 2419.94s]  So, can this be used for more than just
[2419.94s -> 2424.62s]  the science class?
[2424.62s -> 2426.62s]  The science class?
[2426.62s -> 2432.63s]  Nice.
[2432.63s -> 2434.63s]  Okay, if you had a B+, you'd get an A-.
[2434.63s -> 2437.45s]  If I'm the teacher and I look out the window
[2437.45s -> 2439.45s]  and you got like
[2439.45s -> 2441.45s]  an 88, or like an 89
[2441.45s -> 2443.45s]  on this exam here,
[2443.45s -> 2445.45s]  and I see you doing those funny movements out the window
[2445.45s -> 2447.45s]  just kind of dancing around, I'm turning it into
[2447.45s -> 2450.52s]  a 91. I'm making it a 91.
[2450.52s -> 2454.81s]  Your students have gone from C grade
[2454.81s -> 2456.81s]  chumps to B grade brain heads.
[2456.81s -> 2458.81s]  Let's recap how you did.
[2458.81s -> 2464.04s]  All right, tutorial over.
[2464.04s -> 2466.04s]  Provide better staff and facilities to improve
[2466.04s -> 2468.28s]  your students' grades. Make students happy
[2468.28s -> 2470.28s]  and comfortable to increase their learning rate.
[2470.28s -> 2472.28s]  Earn more cash by growing your campus and
[2472.28s -> 2474.65s]  enrolling more students. All right.
[2474.65s -> 2480.41s]  Spend Kudosh to unlock
[2480.41s -> 2482.41s]  new items as well as staff outfits and interior
[2482.41s -> 2485.16s]  design options. Okay, I got half a
[2485.16s -> 2488.23s]  million. Unlock an item with
[2488.23s -> 2492.58s]  Kudosh. Okay.
[2492.58s -> 2497.69s]  Oh, hell yeah.
[2497.69s -> 2501.85s]  Arcade machine.
[2501.85s -> 2503.85s]  What if there's no actual
[2503.85s -> 2505.85s]  learning? I just make a bunch of food places
[2505.85s -> 2513.14s]  and arcade games.
[2513.14s -> 2515.14s]  Just make a big arcade with no actual
[2515.14s -> 2522.31s]  learning. And just give everybody A's.
[2522.31s -> 2526.54s]  Make a casino
[2526.54s -> 2530.12s]  college. Test your strength.
[2530.12s -> 2532.12s]  Yeah, definitely. All right, where am I going to put this?
[2532.12s -> 2537.11s]  In the bathroom?
[2537.11s -> 2539.11s]  You go take a piss and then you come out and just
[2539.11s -> 2551.58s]  I got 200 points.
[2551.58s -> 2556.36s]  Okay. What is this?
[2556.36s -> 2563.53s]  You didn't even try.
[2563.53s -> 2566.34s]  You stink.
[2566.34s -> 2568.34s]  You are offensively
[2568.34s -> 2574.55s]  smelly.
[2574.55s -> 2577.18s]  Oh, I need showers. Oops.
[2577.18s -> 2579.18s]  You're right. You're right. I need showers.
[2579.18s -> 2581.18s]  Where do I do that?
[2581.18s -> 2592.42s]  Shower room. Okay.
[2592.42s -> 2596.52s]  Right here.
[2596.52s -> 2598.52s]  Security breach. Please change
[2598.52s -> 2600.52s]  your passwords. What?
[2600.52s -> 2602.52s]  Oh, I thought you meant. Okay. Was it? What the hell?
[2602.52s -> 2604.70s]  All right. Let's have
[2606.70s -> 2608.70s]  How many of these should I have in here?
[2608.70s -> 2613.69s]  And now for the segment we call
[2613.69s -> 2615.69s]  Agony Answers.
[2615.69s -> 2617.69s]  Should be individual rooms, right?
[2617.69s -> 2619.69s]  Agony Answers. This week's
[2619.69s -> 2621.69s]  problem is
[2621.69s -> 2623.69s]  Get out and lie down under
[2623.69s -> 2625.69s]  these.
[2625.69s -> 2627.69s]  Just lay down flat and push all the buttons.
[2627.69s -> 2630.18s]  I'd start by
[2630.18s -> 2632.18s]  contacting someone under less
[2632.18s -> 2634.18s]  anonymous circumstances.
[2634.18s -> 2636.18s]  Perhaps a friend of the local authorities.
[2636.18s -> 2638.18s]  Best of luck and so on.
[2638.18s -> 2641.19s]  Okay.
[2641.19s -> 2648.54s]  Door? Is that all right?
[2648.54s -> 2652.38s]  Is that okay? Is this okay?
[2652.38s -> 2656.22s]  Do I have to have
[2656.22s -> 2658.22s]  Separation?
[2658.22s -> 2666.20s]  This is fine, right?
[2666.20s -> 2689.75s]  Why is there no shower
[2689.75s -> 2693.98s]  curtain?
[2693.98s -> 2695.98s]  Just like a
[2695.98s -> 2697.98s]  Mario collect the star animation
[2697.98s -> 2699.98s]  and got naked
[2699.98s -> 2701.98s]  without a curtain or anything.
[2701.98s -> 2704.60s]  I probably should put
[2704.60s -> 2709.85s]  doors, right?
[2709.85s -> 2712.28s]  All right. What's wrong
[2712.28s -> 2716.70s]  with you? You have a staff
[2716.70s -> 2718.70s]  on break with nowhere to relax.
[2718.70s -> 2720.94s]  Where? Where are they?
[2720.94s -> 2726.06s]  I have one teacher.
[2726.06s -> 2728.06s]  This one overworked teacher.
[2728.06s -> 2732.54s]  Where are they? Where's my
[2732.54s -> 2740.09s]  staff? Is he sleeping in his
[2740.09s -> 2742.76s]  car?
[2742.76s -> 2745.19s]  No. Wait, wait. There you are.
[2745.19s -> 2756.82s]  I need a staff room.
[2756.82s -> 2758.82s]  I need a staff room. Staff room.
[2758.82s -> 2763.18s]  I need another teacher.
[2763.18s -> 2769.13s]  This person wants a dorm?
[2769.13s -> 2777.13s]  What happens when this gets all the way filled?
[2777.13s -> 2779.13s]  Students are reminded
[2779.13s -> 2781.50s]  that I'm not your mom.
[2781.50s -> 2784.12s]  Jeff vacuum is really carrying this place.
[2784.12s -> 2790.33s]  Okay, I need a staff room.
[2790.33s -> 2792.33s]  Staff room. I have no room. I need a
[2792.33s -> 2800.97s]  bigger building.
[2800.97s -> 2809.48s]  We got to make this really comfortable.
[2809.48s -> 2811.48s]  There are literally two people
[2811.48s -> 2813.66s]  that work here. I don't need more than one
[2813.66s -> 2817.94s]  couch. I was like,
[2817.94s -> 2820.70s]  why are they running? Let's do
[2820.70s -> 2823.58s]  a nice lamp
[2823.58s -> 2828.38s]  and a TV.
[2828.38s -> 2830.38s]  Oh, a dart board. That's nice.
[2830.38s -> 2834.66s]  Sky painting.
[2838.31s -> 2841.96s]  Purple rug.
[2841.96s -> 2845.10s]  Okay. A
[2845.10s -> 2847.10s]  snack table with
[2847.10s -> 2849.85s]  cookies and shit. Yeah.
[2849.85s -> 2854.89s]  I think that's good.
[2854.89s -> 2860.01s]  Here we go. I need some more staff.
[2864.30s -> 2866.30s]  How about another teacher?
[2866.30s -> 2868.47s]  Okay, Mack Pike.
[2868.47s -> 2871.61s]  Weed infestation?
[2871.61s -> 2874.74s]  Isn't that just college? What are you talking about?
[2874.74s -> 2878.46s]  Alright, how about Randy Bird?
[2878.46s -> 2887.61s]  What do you teach? Wait, what do you
[2887.61s -> 2891.70s]  teach? Okay.
[2891.70s -> 2894.97s]  Scientography. Where are these weeds?
[2898.42s -> 2900.42s]  Where are these weeds?
[2900.42s -> 2907.98s]  This one? That's not a problem.
[2907.98s -> 2909.98s]  Alright, I'll get another
[2909.98s -> 2912.41s]  assistant. Oh, no. Another janitor.
[2912.41s -> 2916.57s]  Maintenance. Yeah.
[2916.57s -> 2920.28s]  Definitely.
[2920.28s -> 2922.28s]  Actually, you know, take care of the weeds.
[2922.28s -> 2927.78s]  Okay, B+. That's good.
[2927.78s -> 2931.37s]  Student lounge wanted.
[2931.37s -> 2934.18s]  I've tried kicking back in every
[2934.18s -> 2936.18s]  room on campus, but nothing is quite hitting the spot.
[2936.18s -> 2938.18s]  I think we need a dedicated room for students to hang out
[2938.18s -> 2941.19s]  to relax in the lounge in.
[2941.19s -> 2949.32s]  Alright, fine. Can't fit there.
[2949.32s -> 2958.86s]  That's good enough.
[2958.86s -> 2966.97s]  Microwave.
[2966.97s -> 2970.04s]  What are you going to microwave?
[2970.04s -> 2972.04s]  The, like, old mac and cheese
[2972.04s -> 2974.04s]  machine stuff you get out of that?
[2974.04s -> 2977.62s]  Why would the people...
[2977.62s -> 2979.62s]  Okay, it's microwaved out of
[2979.62s -> 2981.62s]  here, and then you re-microwave
[2981.62s -> 2986.36s]  it over here.
[2986.36s -> 2988.36s]  Okay, here we go. How about some, like, video
[2988.36s -> 2996.10s]  games? Okay, move this
[2996.10s -> 2999.16s]  into here. That's better.
[2999.16s -> 3001.16s]  You're listening to campus radio.
[3001.16s -> 3003.16s]  I love TP.
[3003.16s -> 3005.16s]  Okay.
[3005.16s -> 3007.66s]  What is that?
[3009.90s -> 3012.14s]  This is a clown
[3012.14s -> 3016.87s]  trunk. Yep.
[3016.87s -> 3018.87s]  And funny costumes.
[3018.87s -> 3022.90s]  Fancy hats. That's a pretty good
[3022.90s -> 3024.90s]  student relax room.
[3024.90s -> 3028.74s]  This is not even a couch. I need,
[3028.74s -> 3033.99s]  like, a chair. There.
[3033.99s -> 3037.90s]  Good enough. Alright, go have fun.
[3037.90s -> 3045.96s]  Alright, we need... Students will
[3045.96s -> 3047.96s]  send a request. Level
[3047.96s -> 3051.80s]  3 science lab. There we go.
[3051.80s -> 3060.25s]  Okay, how do I level up the science lab?
[3060.25s -> 3064.09s]  Why is the environment so bad?
[3064.09s -> 3067.93s]  Cheese and fire crackers.
[3067.93s -> 3074.52s]  There are a lot of jobs for janitors around
[3074.52s -> 3076.52s]  campus. I already have
[3076.52s -> 3078.52s]  two janitors.
[3078.52s -> 3085.82s]  How do I upgrade the room?
[3085.82s -> 3091.38s]  That music's a little loud.
[3091.38s -> 3104.74s]  There you go. That's better. Maybe make the room
[3104.74s -> 3108.84s]  bigger and add furniture. Oh!
[3108.84s -> 3116.95s]  Where'd you get a hot dog?
[3116.95s -> 3122.78s]  Do I sell hot dogs here? You're not going to eat it?
[3122.78s -> 3125.08s]  Wait, you're just going to microwave a
[3125.08s -> 3127.08s]  hot dog in the bun and then
[3127.08s -> 3130.47s]  put it in your pocket?
[3133.72s -> 3135.72s]  Okay, wait, wait, wait. They have a bee.
[3135.72s -> 3138.66s]  Oh, okay, hold on. Let me add some stuff.
[3138.66s -> 3144.74s]  Okay, we need... Here we go.
[3144.74s -> 3146.92s]  More, like, science equipment.
[3146.92s -> 3151.70s]  A whiteboard.
[3151.70s -> 3153.70s]  And, dude,
[3153.70s -> 3155.70s]  that's $8,000. No.
[3155.70s -> 3169.06s]  That's good enough.
[3169.06s -> 3171.50s]  Is that enough? I need a roof?
[3171.50s -> 3176.42s]  There's already a roof on here. Campus management.
[3176.42s -> 3180.18s]  No, we're good. Alright,
[3180.18s -> 3185.43s]  level 3 science lab.
[3185.43s -> 3187.43s]  Room prestige. This place still sucks.
[3187.43s -> 3189.43s]  Hold on.
[3191.43s -> 3194.18s]  Oh, I got it. End of the year rewards.
[3194.18s -> 3197.51s]  Oh, my God.
[3197.51s -> 3200.07s]  I just punched you in the face. I'm sorry.
[3200.07s -> 3204.42s]  So what happened? Expelled?
[3204.42s -> 3211.72s]  Alright.
[3211.72s -> 3214.73s]  My pass rate is 100%.
[3214.73s -> 3216.73s]  Average exam is 81%.
[3222.07s -> 3224.07s]  Oh, okay, so now end of the year. No one's here
[3224.07s -> 3227.66s]  so I can do management.
[3227.66s -> 3229.66s]  Okay, let's expand our range of courses by starting
[3229.66s -> 3231.66s]  a virtual normality course.
[3234.47s -> 3236.78s]  Alright, new course. Next year's fee
[3236.78s -> 3238.78s]  is $180,000
[3238.78s -> 3242.36s]  for the year?
[3244.36s -> 3246.36s]  Okay, so this is the virtual reality
[3246.36s -> 3248.36s]  class.
[3250.36s -> 3252.36s]  Can I do something else, too? That sounds good.
[3252.36s -> 3258.12s]  Alright, cool. Buy a new plot
[3258.12s -> 3260.42s]  for your second year.
[3260.42s -> 3262.42s]  This is not quite business as usual here at
[3262.42s -> 3264.42s]  Duckworth Campus Food Court.
[3264.42s -> 3266.42s]  Where one of the servers has lost
[3266.42s -> 3268.42s]  a contact lens.
[3268.42s -> 3270.42s]  Unfortunately, they do believe the lens was
[3270.42s -> 3272.42s]  lost during the preparation of a
[3272.42s -> 3274.42s]  particularly big lasagna.
[3274.42s -> 3276.42s]  They're asking every student
[3276.42s -> 3278.42s]  to check their portion before
[3278.42s -> 3280.42s]  they chew. But as of yet,
[3280.42s -> 3282.42s]  no sight of the missing
[3282.42s -> 3284.42s]  lens. I have to redo some of this.
[3284.42s -> 3286.42s]  This looks pretty terrible.
[3286.42s -> 3288.42s]  This looks terrible.
[3288.42s -> 3291.69s]  I should have one be
[3291.69s -> 3294.82s]  dormitory, right?
[3294.82s -> 3296.82s]  Dorm. Student
[3296.82s -> 3298.82s]  facilities.
[3298.82s -> 3301.90s]  Food. Lunch. Yeah.
[3301.90s -> 3303.90s]  One of them's going to be the
[3303.90s -> 3306.33s]  actual work building.
[3306.33s -> 3308.50s]  So, we're going to change this.
[3308.50s -> 3310.50s]  This is going to be the actual student dormitory
[3310.50s -> 3315.11s]  student facility. Okay, so let's move this.
[3315.11s -> 3317.11s]  Why are the students still here? It's summer break.
[3321.06s -> 3327.78s]  What's the problem?
[3327.78s -> 3331.86s]  Course points?
[3331.86s -> 3340.25s]  What are the course points?
[3340.25s -> 3343.45s]  Alright, get rid of this.
[3343.45s -> 3345.45s]  Can I move this whole building? The whole thing?
[3345.45s -> 3371.37s]  Just sell it?
[3371.37s -> 3373.86s]  Move your webcam?
[3373.86s -> 3376.49s]  Oh, sorry. Oops.
[3376.49s -> 3378.49s]  Just remake it? Yeah, I'll sell it.
[3380.92s -> 3382.92s]  Alright, everybody take a shower
[3382.92s -> 3385.16s]  but then get out of here.
[3385.16s -> 3389.77s]  Alright, close the room. Everybody out.
[3389.77s -> 3392.07s]  Sell this whole thing.
[3392.07s -> 3394.57s]  Fourteen thousand dollars. You got it.
[3394.57s -> 3401.67s]  Okay, cool. Someone was
[3401.67s -> 3406.98s]  in there. Alright, we're good.
[3406.98s -> 3408.98s]  Okay, pause the game
[3408.98s -> 3412.70s]  because the people are going to freak out.
[3412.70s -> 3418.58s]  Oh, yeah. Actually,
[3418.58s -> 3428.76s]  probably over here is better. It's better over here.
[3435.35s -> 3437.35s]  Alright, it's paused.
[3437.35s -> 3439.35s]  Alright, so now, it's time to
[3439.35s -> 3441.91s]  expand. You can build.
[3441.91s -> 3445.50s]  A lot of areas in this game.
[3445.50s -> 3447.50s]  Like never before?
[3447.50s -> 3449.50s]  Mirror world?
[3451.50s -> 3453.50s]  Oh, you think I look weird because
[3453.50s -> 3455.50s]  I flipped it, right?
[3457.50s -> 3459.50s]  Yeah, this is weird.
[3459.50s -> 3461.50s]  This is when you take a picture of yourself
[3461.50s -> 3463.50s]  with an iPhone
[3463.50s -> 3465.50s]  and your face looks like
[3465.50s -> 3468.89s]  you hit it with a hammer like five times
[3468.89s -> 3473.50s]  because you're seeing yourself flipped.
[3473.50s -> 3475.50s]  It's like, what's wrong with my face?
[3475.50s -> 3477.80s]  Why does my face look like that?
[3477.80s -> 3483.86s]  No, I know what you mean. Watch.
[3483.86s -> 3487.32s]  I'll show you. Ready? So, check this out.
[3487.32s -> 3492.50s]  This is what I actually look like.
[3492.50s -> 3500.42s]  Isn't that weird?
[3500.42s -> 3502.42s]  This is what my face looks like, for real.
[3502.42s -> 3505.75s]  But if you flip it, it turns you into like a
[3505.75s -> 3528.26s]  nightmare person. See?
[3528.26s -> 3535.05s]  You definitely, you caught me.
[3535.05s -> 3538.89s]  It does look weird, though. I agree.
[3541.38s -> 3543.38s]  Okay, two point campus!
[3543.38s -> 3549.26s]  Which, by the way, in case you didn't know,
[3549.26s -> 3553.53s]  by the same people that made Two Point Hospital
[3553.53s -> 3556.79s]  and in case you didn't know, it's on every
[3556.79s -> 3558.97s]  it's on, it's PlayStation, it's on
[3558.97s -> 3561.66s]  PC, it's on Xbox.
[3561.66s -> 3563.66s]  There's a new and improved relationship system. Have I told you
[3563.66s -> 3567.94s]  that one yet? Have we talked about that yet?
[3567.94s -> 3569.94s]  Nurture and grow your students with a deeper and more meaningful
[3569.94s -> 3572.68s]  sense of connection. In case you didn't know.
[3572.68s -> 3574.68s]  Keep the students happy with clubs, societies,
[3574.68s -> 3576.68s]  gigs. Surround them with friends.
[3576.68s -> 3578.68s]  Help them develop relationships and furnish them with
[3578.68s -> 3584.02s]  care. You understand?
[3584.02s -> 3588.12s]  That's in this game. Nurture!
[3588.12s -> 3593.48s]  Nurture!
[3593.48s -> 3596.74s]  Why are you in a fisheye lens?
[3596.74s -> 3599.50s]  Can I do a fisheye lens?
[3599.50s -> 3601.50s]  Hold on. Can I do a slight fisheye
[3601.50s -> 3608.41s]  lens? Is that possible in just like
[3608.41s -> 3612.44s]  OBS? Not enough, just enough to
[3612.44s -> 3614.44s]  look a little weird. What's action movie?
[3614.44s -> 3617.26s]  Holy shit, I look so much
[3617.26s -> 3619.26s]  cooler. What?
[3619.26s -> 3627.43s]  Oh, yes.
[3627.43s -> 3629.43s]  That looks so much better. Wow.
[3629.43s -> 3631.43s]  Actually, I'm keeping this filter on. I'm not even getting around.
[3631.43s -> 3636.94s]  These look so much better than just being
[3636.94s -> 3638.94s]  a regular. No, I'm putting
[3638.94s -> 3641.94s]  this one. Look at how good this looks.
[3641.94s -> 3643.94s]  This actually looks better. That's ridiculous.
[3643.94s -> 3650.09s]  Okay. Well, that's cool.
[3650.09s -> 3656.55s]  I'm gonna keep this on. I thought I just
[3656.55s -> 3658.55s]  I thought I just closed my fucking OBS
[3658.55s -> 3661.88s]  and end of the stream. Alright.
[3661.88s -> 3663.88s]  Hey, I gotta play. I gotta play. I gotta play.
[3663.88s -> 3669.58s]  If I go to the school and some psycho keeps
[3669.58s -> 3671.58s]  stealing the shower.
[3671.58s -> 3674.58s]  That's very weird considering
[3674.58s -> 3676.58s]  that you're supposed to be paused
[3676.58s -> 3678.58s]  and frozen. So you're not actually
[3678.58s -> 3680.58s]  here. Because if you were, you
[3680.58s -> 3682.58s]  wouldn't be talking right now, would you?
[3691.96s -> 3694.71s]  Okay. Don't just drag it
[3694.71s -> 3697.78s]  like an idiot. Where do I want
[3697.78s -> 3699.78s]  all the beds? Right here, right?
[3699.78s -> 3705.99s]  I'm thinking just like right here
[3705.99s -> 3707.99s]  and then we'll do bathrooms, shower
[3707.99s -> 3711.51s]  and then student facilities. So
[3711.51s -> 3713.51s]  this is gonna be dorm rooms, beds and shit.
[3713.51s -> 3719.96s]  That doesn't need to be huge. It doesn't
[3719.96s -> 3723.48s]  need to be gigantic. We want good
[3723.48s -> 3727.83s]  beds. So let's go like one,
[3727.83s -> 3730.90s]  two, up to
[3730.90s -> 3733.34s]  five people can have a bed together.
[3733.34s -> 3735.34s]  It's weird to say that out loud. I know. I'm sorry.
[3735.34s -> 3746.28s]  Okay. It's five, ten, fifteen,
[3746.28s -> 3750.12s]  twenty, twenty-five, thirty.
[3750.12s -> 3754.09s]  That's I can add them later if I need to.
[3754.09s -> 3759.77s]  There's that. We should have a couple
[3759.77s -> 3763.48s]  wardrobes so people aren't fighting over it.
[3763.48s -> 3771.46s]  Add some desks. Okay.
[3771.46s -> 3777.27s]  Okay. What is this?
[3777.27s -> 3780.09s]  Oh, a dorm notice board.
[3780.09s -> 3784.31s]  Where should this go? How about like right here?
[3784.31s -> 3787.64s]  See? People like that.
[3787.64s -> 3793.58s]  Trash can.
[3793.58s -> 3810.26s]  Trash cans. What is this?
[3810.26s -> 3814.17s]  Oh, I thought I had four hundred and sixty-nine
[3814.17s -> 3816.34s]  thousand Kudosh
[3816.34s -> 3819.16s]  coins. I was gonna say this is not
[3819.16s -> 3821.66s]  tuned correctly. I was like this is
[3821.66s -> 3823.66s]  really inexpensive. You can definitely buy everything.
[3823.66s -> 3826.34s]  That's why I was just buying everything.
[3826.34s -> 3828.34s]  I thought I had five hundred grand in this currency.
[3828.34s -> 3831.40s]  So I bought some of this
[3831.40s -> 3833.40s]  dumb shit. How much was the clown
[3833.40s -> 3838.90s]  trunk? This feels like my channel point
[3838.90s -> 3843.51s]  rewards. That's what I was thinking. I was like, ah,
[3843.51s -> 3845.51s]  they're very low. It's like
[3845.51s -> 3847.51s]  two hundred channel points
[3847.51s -> 3855.83s]  to do anything here.
[3855.83s -> 3857.83s]  This is the relationship bed?
[3857.83s -> 3859.83s]  I bought this painting.
[3859.83s -> 3861.83s]  Well, I have to use it then.
[3861.83s -> 3863.83s]  Everybody gets one.
[3863.83s -> 3869.10s]  Okay, I'm
[3869.10s -> 3875.37s]  turning the clown sounds off. Everybody
[3875.37s -> 3880.36s]  gets one of these. And I got the rug too.
[3880.36s -> 3882.66s]  So we're gonna put a rug down under
[3882.66s -> 3891.11s]  a couple of the beds. Okay.
[3891.11s -> 3895.38s]  Sanitizer. Plant.
[3895.38s -> 3908.76s]  Yeah, I'm gonna delete all channel points. All channel
[3908.76s -> 3913.69s]  points are getting deleted. And we're gonna bring
[3913.69s -> 3915.69s]  it back even stronger. You know
[3915.69s -> 3919.08s]  what I mean? Okay, so that's fine. This is a nice little
[3919.08s -> 3921.08s]  dorm area. This bed needs to be
[3921.08s -> 3926.65s]  actually on the wall. Everything looks good, right?
[3926.65s -> 3929.02s]  Okay. So that's good.
[3929.02s -> 3935.14s]  What am I missing? What's wrong? Oh, there's
[3935.14s -> 3940.46s]  no door. There's dormitory
[3940.46s -> 3944.98s]  too, apparently. All right.
[3944.98s -> 3946.98s]  So now I'm gonna make a bathroom right here.
[3946.98s -> 3952.10s]  Bathroom and shower room will be right
[3952.10s -> 3955.22s]  here and here. And then
[3955.22s -> 3957.85s]  the hangout room will be here. And there you
[3957.85s -> 3963.03s]  go. What do you
[3963.03s -> 3965.03s]  guys do in channel points? I gotta turn off channel points.
[3965.03s -> 3967.03s]  Delete. Make channel points not redeemable.
[3967.03s -> 3993.45s]  Sink. Hand dryer.
[3993.45s -> 3997.40s]  And a
[3997.40s -> 4001.43s]  trash, just in case.
[4001.43s -> 4003.43s]  Wait, one more sink on the other side. Yeah, right here.
[4003.43s -> 4008.47s]  Now I need a door. I actually want
[4008.47s -> 4011.80s]  the door to be here. I screwed it up on them.
[4011.80s -> 4021.64s]  That's better. Okay. Shower's gonna
[4021.64s -> 4024.31s]  go here. I'm smart. I have
[4024.31s -> 4026.31s]  to turn off channel points right now. It's out of
[4026.31s -> 4029.96s]  control. How do I turn channel points
[4029.96s -> 4032.26s]  off? I need to turn it off right now. How do I turn it off?
[4032.26s -> 4043.38s]  How do you turn off channel points? How do you turn
[4043.38s -> 4046.14s]  them off? I have to turn them off now. Yeah, no, no, no.
[4046.14s -> 4049.27s]  Fine. I'm not gonna turn it off. Would you
[4049.27s -> 4051.83s]  shut up? We'll put it in emote only
[4051.83s -> 4053.83s]  mode and you shut your
[4053.83s -> 4056.52s]  shut up. I'm very angry right
[4056.52s -> 4058.52s]  now. This is a sponsor stream and you're making
[4058.52s -> 4069.08s]  us look bad. How am I supposed to show up
[4069.08s -> 4075.08s]  to the board meeting? Huh? How am I supposed
[4075.08s -> 4077.26s]  to show up to the next board meeting and explain
[4077.26s -> 4079.75s]  to everybody at that part of the
[4079.75s -> 4083.98s]  organization what's going on here? By the way,
[4083.98s -> 4089.42s]  the board is me and Otto.
[4089.42s -> 4092.42s]  And by the way, he's the accountant. I don't handle
[4092.42s -> 4099.21s]  that. Don't delete the room. Room's done.
[4099.21s -> 4105.02s]  Yeah, keep it in emote only.
[4105.02s -> 4107.02s]  They're abusing the channel points and I don't like
[4107.02s -> 4109.45s]  it. It's making me very, very upset.
[4109.45s -> 4117.06s]  Don't you just imagine Otto with like a pair of glasses
[4117.06s -> 4121.86s]  on and a suit. He's like a
[4121.86s -> 4123.86s]  board room table with like a pencil and
[4123.86s -> 4127.58s]  a paper and he just doesn't know what he's
[4127.58s -> 4131.54s]  doing and it's just so cute. Okay, showers.
[4131.54s -> 4146.82s]  Okay. Maybe one sink.
[4146.82s -> 4151.22s]  One more towel rack. That's better.
[4151.22s -> 4153.91s]  Okay, good. Complete it. There we go.
[4153.91s -> 4158.14s]  Much cleaner. Much
[4158.14s -> 4162.62s]  cleaner. And then there's enough room in the hallway,
[4162.62s -> 4165.50s]  right? Okay. Because then this will be
[4165.50s -> 4167.50s]  an activity kind of area for the students,
[4167.50s -> 4173.43s]  right? Campus building. Student
[4173.43s -> 4175.43s]  lounge. Yep. Okay. Student lounge.
[4175.43s -> 4188.58s]  Shit. No, it's okay. It's alright.
[4188.58s -> 4194.65s]  There's enough room. There's enough room. Yeah, we're fine.
[4194.65s -> 4202.71s]  Alright, that's good. Maybe two couches.
[4202.71s -> 4210.76s]  A little game table.
[4210.76s -> 4213.90s]  Microwavable snacks. Like a sink to
[4213.90s -> 4217.61s]  wash your hands. Arcade machines.
[4217.61s -> 4232.90s]  I almost did it.
[4239.34s -> 4241.34s]  There are TVs.
[4243.34s -> 4245.77s]  There's no TVs.
[4258.17s -> 4262.78s]  That was good. Alright, on the count of three, I want you to
[4262.78s -> 4265.85s]  let them out of emote only. On the count of three.
[4265.85s -> 4269.11s]  Let them out of emote only on the count of three.
[4269.11s -> 4271.99s]  And I'm going to sit here silently.
[4271.99s -> 4275.00s]  And if I'm not happy, it's going back. One, two, three, go.
[4275.00s -> 4291.18s]  I'm happy.
[4291.18s -> 4293.99s]  Is that too much? The one clown
[4293.99s -> 4296.74s]  trunk? Costume area?
[4296.74s -> 4298.74s]  Yeah. Alright, this is fun.
[4298.74s -> 4301.37s]  Maybe another chair in the middle or something.
[4301.37s -> 4306.15s]  Dartboard over here, too? Yeah, dartboard.
[4306.15s -> 4311.06s]  Maybe
[4311.06s -> 4313.06s]  somebody's to watch
[4313.06s -> 4317.48s]  people just sit here.
[4317.48s -> 4319.48s]  Do you want to have a little hangout
[4319.48s -> 4322.87s]  in this couch area?
[4322.87s -> 4324.87s]  Yeah, like a place to lounge and have
[4324.87s -> 4327.37s]  a snack together. Yeah, that's fine.
[4327.37s -> 4331.78s]  Alright, we're done. This one's perfect.
[4331.78s -> 4333.78s]  Alright, so this is the student hangout zone.
[4333.78s -> 4338.18s]  Student hangout zone looks good.
[4338.18s -> 4345.46s]  Now let me remove it from over here.
[4345.46s -> 4347.46s]  They're all here. Well, they'll figure it out.
[4347.46s -> 4356.98s]  I should probably keep the bathroom.
[4356.98s -> 4358.98s]  So you don't have to go all the way back to the student
[4358.98s -> 4361.80s]  lounge to go to the bathroom?
[4361.80s -> 4365.24s]  What? That's fine. Okay.
[4365.24s -> 4367.24s]  This has got to move, too. This is
[4367.24s -> 4375.93s]  annoying in the way. Can I pick it up?
[4375.93s -> 4380.98s]  Let's make a new one. I'll make a new one of these, too.
[4380.98s -> 4385.90s]  Wait, if I delete this, I'll lose
[4385.90s -> 4392.02s]  the prestige, right?
[4392.02s -> 4394.84s]  That's actually a bad idea. That's a really bad idea,
[4394.84s -> 4406.92s]  isn't it? Yeah.
[4406.92s -> 4409.61s]  One person just goes, yeah.
[4409.61s -> 4412.42s]  Y-E. And to see
[4412.42s -> 4414.42s]  if people are getting just banned and timed
[4414.42s -> 4420.55s]  out. Yeah. Yeah.
[4420.55s -> 4426.70s]  Thanks for the help. I
[4426.70s -> 4429.19s]  appreciate it, man. Alright, so
[4429.19s -> 4431.19s]  I'm gonna just expand it.
[4431.19s -> 4438.46s]  It can stay here. Yeah.
[4438.46s -> 4443.62s]  Ooh. Okay, wait. I need to
[4443.62s -> 4448.09s]  edit the room. Pick up room, edit
[4448.09s -> 4450.09s]  room. Alright, here we go. Let's add
[4450.09s -> 4455.78s]  some wall like that.
[4455.78s -> 4458.73s]  Okay.
[4463.22s -> 4465.22s]  This can stay over here. I need the other science
[4465.22s -> 4467.22s]  equipment, right?
[4467.22s -> 4469.22s]  Wait, edit it again.
[4473.85s -> 4477.82s]  What is this guy talking
[4477.82s -> 4485.18s]  about? Okay, now I need
[4485.18s -> 4487.18s]  another piece of equipment in here. Something better.
[4487.18s -> 4506.74s]  I need some science equipment. What the
[4506.74s -> 4510.57s]  fuck is that? Um, how do I find
[4510.57s -> 4518.63s]  it? Where's the science room stuff?
[4518.63s -> 4523.93s]  Oh, here we go. Okay. I don't have enough to do
[4523.93s -> 4525.93s]  that, but I can make the room better, right?
[4525.93s -> 4527.93s]  So I got a couple of those. It's almost a level
[4527.93s -> 4531.06s]  of prestige up. So let's do two of these.
[4531.06s -> 4533.06s]  There we go. Science lab level three.
[4533.06s -> 4537.14s]  Yes! A couple more whiteboards.
[4537.14s -> 4542.46s]  A place to sit down, right?
[4542.46s -> 4553.51s]  Is there any desks or anything? Oh,
[4553.51s -> 4555.75s]  why would I not? I spent it on
[4555.75s -> 4558.06s]  a piñata or whatever the hell it was.
[4558.06s -> 4569.77s]  What did I even spend that money on? Okay, that's fine.
[4569.77s -> 4573.35s]  What's wrong with your camera? It's bent.
[4573.35s -> 4586.02s]  Is that a window or did I just take the wall
[4586.02s -> 4590.38s]  away? How are those windows?
[4590.38s -> 4598.10s]  Oh, people really like that. This is
[4598.10s -> 4603.72s]  level five now. Okay.
[4603.72s -> 4605.72s]  Alright, so this place is better. I need like
[4605.72s -> 4613.59s]  chairs or something. I need chairs.
[4613.59s -> 4618.70s]  There we go. It's five, um,
[4618.70s -> 4626.36s]  what are they called? Isn't it suma
[4626.36s -> 4632.70s]  not sume? It is?
[4632.70s -> 4635.82s]  Wait, is it sumo? What did I say?
[4635.82s -> 4638.63s]  Sumekomlade.
[4638.63s -> 4644.95s]  Yeah. Alright, that's good enough.
[4644.95s -> 4646.95s]  I got it leveled up. So that'll be giving
[4646.95s -> 4648.95s]  people better grades now.
[4648.95s -> 4651.45s]  I'm strictly an anti-camera
[4651.45s -> 4653.62s]  kind of guy. I need a lecture hall.
[4653.62s -> 4655.62s]  My philosophy is I can't
[4655.62s -> 4657.62s]  see you, you can't see me.
[4657.62s -> 4659.62s]  Lecture hall will go right in the middle. So I like to
[4659.62s -> 4661.62s]  keep things as low tech as possible.
[4661.62s -> 4663.93s]  I'd recommend strategically
[4663.93s -> 4665.93s]  placed strings
[4665.93s -> 4667.93s]  attached to some bells.
[4667.93s -> 4669.93s]  You hear a ring and you got yourself
[4669.93s -> 4671.93s]  a visitor. Of course,
[4671.93s -> 4673.93s]  sometimes it's the doorbell
[4673.93s -> 4675.93s]  and you really do have a visitor. Alright, what else can I put in here?
[4675.93s -> 4677.93s]  Is it a camera?
[4681.93s -> 4683.93s]  This guy.
[4683.93s -> 4685.93s]  These guys are freaking me out.
[4693.90s -> 4696.52s]  Okay, people like that. Wipe board
[4696.52s -> 4700.23s]  behind you over here.
[4700.23s -> 4702.79s]  Just in case you need like a ton to show a lot of work.
[4702.79s -> 4708.94s]  Trash cans and
[4708.94s -> 4712.90s]  sanitizations. Okay.
[4712.90s -> 4716.10s]  And plants. Looks good.
[4716.10s -> 4718.60s]  Do I have two of these? No.
[4718.60s -> 4729.14s]  Should I? Shit.
[4729.14s -> 4733.18s]  Does that matter? I don't think that
[4733.18s -> 4743.10s]  I don't think this matters. It gave me points.
[4743.10s -> 4748.41s]  What's that? What poll? That's fine. It gave me points.
[4748.41s -> 4752.06s]  I don't care. Alright, that's a lecture hall.
[4752.06s -> 4755.06s]  Now we have to build the other
[4755.06s -> 4757.75s]  room which is the
[4757.75s -> 4759.75s]  VR lab.
[4759.75s -> 4762.06s]  35 grand. Alright, I hope this is worth it.
[4762.06s -> 4766.92s]  I'm thinking over here, right? Like yeah,
[4766.92s -> 4773.24s]  over here. Alright, this is the VR lab.
[4773.24s -> 4781.42s]  Should I make it bigger? Bigger?
[4781.42s -> 4790.04s]  Should I fill this whole thing? Yeah.
[4790.04s -> 4793.86s]  Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
[4793.86s -> 4810.87s]  Yeah.
[4810.87s -> 4812.87s]  Is that too big on this side though? Maybe
[4812.87s -> 4814.87s]  whatever. I don't care. It's fine.
[4814.87s -> 4818.07s]  I hate the way it looks. I hate
[4818.07s -> 4843.99s]  the way it looks. I hate the way this looks.
[4843.99s -> 4851.40s]  Why do I hate this so much? Should I just fill
[4851.40s -> 4855.18s]  the space and just say fuck it? Who cares? I'm just gonna
[4855.18s -> 4861.19s]  whatever. Fill it. It doesn't matter.
[4861.19s -> 4865.35s]  Should I have more than one of these? Okay,
[4865.35s -> 4868.87s]  so this is a VR
[4868.87s -> 4872.20s]  area here. I should probably have more
[4872.20s -> 4875.98s]  than a few of these. This is a VR
[4875.98s -> 4877.98s]  chair. These are
[4877.98s -> 4883.29s]  really expensive.
[4885.78s -> 4888.54s]  Five?
[4888.54s -> 4890.54s]  Okay, I'm gonna do
[4890.54s -> 4892.54s]  five of those and then the VR desk.
[4892.54s -> 4900.52s]  Wait, they need to be in front of them?
[4900.52s -> 4905.00s]  I'll just do this. And then
[4905.00s -> 4908.97s]  VR headsets.
[4908.97s -> 4922.52s]  Where do these go? Against the wall here?
[4922.52s -> 4925.14s]  Okay. Hand sanitizer.
[4925.14s -> 4929.43s]  Is that okay? Do I have
[4929.43s -> 4938.95s]  two? I'm gonna do two. And then
[4938.95s -> 4955.82s]  windows. Okay.
[4955.82s -> 4964.06s]  Trash can. Okay. Windows
[4964.06s -> 4967.82s]  in a VR room. Why what?
[4967.82s -> 4969.82s]  What platform is the best to buy Two Point
[4969.82s -> 4971.82s]  Campus on? I'm really glad you brought that
[4971.82s -> 4973.82s]  up, Mons. Let me tell you. You got
[4973.82s -> 4975.99s]  quite a few options here. You've got PlayStation.
[4975.99s -> 4977.99s]  You've got Xbox. You've got
[4977.99s -> 4979.99s]  PC. You've even got
[4979.99s -> 4994.84s]  the, um, you've got it on the Nintendo
[4994.84s -> 4996.84s]  Switch. So you've got a lot of options.
[4996.84s -> 5000.55s]  Pretty much every major platform this is
[5000.55s -> 5002.92s]  available on. It's got
[5002.92s -> 5005.16s]  really cool new abilities. You can
[5005.16s -> 5007.16s]  build in the, for the first time, you can build
[5007.16s -> 5009.40s]  in the great outdoors. You can build outside,
[5009.40s -> 5011.83s]  which is the, uh, you couldn't do that before. Uh,
[5011.83s -> 5013.83s]  if I were to take a pic right now, I would say it's,
[5013.83s -> 5015.83s]  you know, I'm gonna give you a little wild
[5015.83s -> 5018.20s]  card here. I'm gonna say this is probably great
[5018.20s -> 5020.20s]  on the Switch, because you can bring it into the bathroom.
[5020.20s -> 5022.76s]  This place, this is a perfect go to
[5022.76s -> 5024.94s]  the bathroom game, I think, if I'm gonna be really
[5024.94s -> 5027.94s]  honest with you. I can see myself playing this in the bathroom.
[5027.94s -> 5034.46s]  The Switch lets you do that. What
[5034.46s -> 5036.82s]  is he looking out the window for? Alright, that
[5036.82s -> 5041.93s]  looks good. Maybe some,
[5041.93s -> 5048.39s]  maybe this is too big. Here's a question
[5048.39s -> 5052.10s]  from Gyro. What is some
[5052.10s -> 5054.10s]  of your favorite panic room past
[5054.10s -> 5056.10s]  times? This guy with the panic rooms.
[5056.10s -> 5058.10s]  What is this, this guy,
[5058.10s -> 5060.10s]  this guy. I find that you can have a lot of
[5060.10s -> 5062.10s]  fun with a little bouncing wall. This guy has
[5062.10s -> 5064.10s]  one piece of content. In fact,
[5064.10s -> 5066.28s]  one time I was bouncing,
[5066.28s -> 5068.28s]  lost track of time, and it turned
[5068.28s -> 5070.28s]  out that I've been doing it for 16 hours. I think we're ready to start the next year.
[5070.28s -> 5072.65s]  I went cold turkey
[5072.65s -> 5074.89s]  after that, meaning I was hungry. So we've got
[5074.89s -> 5076.89s]  the library still. Should I put the library in the
[5076.89s -> 5079.58s]  student hall? That might make more sense
[5079.58s -> 5085.59s]  over here. What do you think? Library
[5085.59s -> 5087.59s]  in the academic building or library
[5087.59s -> 5089.59s]  in the student area?
[5089.59s -> 5095.40s]  Yeah? Yeah? What?
[5095.40s -> 5105.70s]  Nah. I don't know what just happened but it's gone.
[5105.70s -> 5108.65s]  Okay, thank goodness.
[5108.65s -> 5122.26s]  Stop. I'm going to put the library here
[5122.26s -> 5130.33s]  where the students are. Wait, oh
[5130.33s -> 5132.33s]  no, this is the staff room. I don't want this over here.
[5132.33s -> 5146.02s]  Okay, keep it there. This is the library.
[5146.02s -> 5152.92s]  I need two lecture theaters?
[5152.92s -> 5167.96s]  Oh, that's not good. Okay, I
[5167.96s -> 5170.78s]  need another one of these. I need another
[5170.78s -> 5180.82s]  receptionist here. This room is way
[5180.82s -> 5205.96s]  freaking small. Salad.
[5205.96s -> 5213.56s]  Computer desk? Yep, we need
[5213.56s -> 5219.37s]  computers. Maybe two of these?
[5219.37s -> 5221.54s]  Make a meth lab.
[5221.54s -> 5224.94s]  That's not happening.
[5224.94s -> 5228.06s]  Alright, some more books? Okay.
[5228.06s -> 5230.06s]  This is now a true, this is a library now.
[5230.06s -> 5240.87s]  The room has the same painting. Alright.
[5240.87s -> 5243.50s]  That's much better. I do
[5243.50s -> 5245.50s]  need two people working here now.
[5245.50s -> 5248.44s]  Yeah? Okay, I need two people working
[5248.44s -> 5251.51s]  there. That's good. That
[5251.51s -> 5253.51s]  meeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[5253.51s -> 5255.51s]  I just froze. My brain just
[5255.51s -> 5261.53s]  turned off. The lecture hall, they have to be
[5261.53s -> 5267.54s]  back to back over here.
[5271.19s -> 5280.22s]  One step ahead, sneaky getaway.
[5280.22s -> 5282.90s]  Couldn't install your panic room
[5282.90s -> 5285.14s]  in a hall of mirrors.
[5285.14s -> 5288.02s]  Or, get signed on the door that
[5288.02s -> 5290.02s]  says, out for lunch.
[5290.02s -> 5292.65s]  This place is way too big.
[5292.65s -> 5294.65s]  It's massive. It doesn't need to be
[5294.65s -> 5299.06s]  this big at all. Let's
[5299.06s -> 5319.02s]  close it up a little. Salad.
[5319.02s -> 5331.40s]  Salad. Salad. Salad.
[5331.40s -> 5337.34s]  Salad. Salad. Salad.
[5337.34s -> 5356.06s]  Salad. Salad. Salad.
[5356.06s -> 5368.06s]  How do I do it? How do I sell this?
[5368.06s -> 5370.06s]  Is your camera on 120 FOV? I don't
[5370.06s -> 5374.65s]  think so. How do I sell it? Subtract,
[5374.65s -> 5382.76s]  right? Yes. How do I do it? Which
[5382.76s -> 5386.79s]  pizza is the best? What's going on?
[5386.79s -> 5389.42s]  This is so wrong. Meat pizza sucks.
[5389.42s -> 5393.64s]  If you say that meat,
[5393.64s -> 5395.64s]  like meat pizza, I'm imagining
[5395.64s -> 5399.99s]  meat time is meat lover's pizza. Wait,
[5399.99s -> 5401.99s]  it costs money to vote on this poll. I was
[5401.99s -> 5406.28s]  wait, what? No, I'm not wrong. I'm not wrong.
[5406.28s -> 5409.40s]  Let me tell you something. Listen to me.
[5409.40s -> 5411.40s]  Pepperoni is amazing on pizza. Sausage
[5411.40s -> 5413.40s]  is amazing on pizza. Hamburger is amazing
[5413.40s -> 5417.22s]  on pizza.
[5417.22s -> 5419.22s]  Turkey or whatever. I don't know. Whatever
[5419.22s -> 5422.04s]  weird shit. Chicken is amazing on pizza.
[5422.04s -> 5424.04s]  But when you put them all on it at the same
[5424.04s -> 5426.04s]  time, it ruins everything.
[5426.04s -> 5430.07s]  It just becomes a fucking lasagna. You can't
[5430.07s -> 5432.07s]  you pick it up. You try to pick a piece of
[5432.07s -> 5434.31s]  meat lover's pizza up. It falls apart.
[5434.31s -> 5437.45s]  It goes everywhere. It's not even a piece
[5437.45s -> 5440.97s]  of pizza anymore. It's just annoying. I'm of
[5440.97s -> 5442.97s]  the opinion, and you guys can tell me if I'm wrong here, but that's fine.
[5442.97s -> 5445.27s]  It doesn't bother me. I don't think
[5445.27s -> 5447.27s]  there should ever be more than two toppings on a pizza
[5447.27s -> 5450.46s]  ever. Ever. For any reason.
[5450.46s -> 5452.46s]  When you put more than two toppings on a
[5452.46s -> 5454.46s]  pizza, it weighs down to a point
[5454.46s -> 5456.46s]  where it cannot be eaten anymore the way that pizza
[5456.46s -> 5458.46s]  is. At that point, it's not a pizza. It's a casserole.
[5458.46s -> 5461.66s]  Three maybe. Depends on what it is.
[5461.66s -> 5464.22s]  If you...
[5464.22s -> 5466.22s]  This fucking
[5466.22s -> 5468.22s]  panic room guy.
[5468.22s -> 5470.22s]  I need to quiet him while
[5470.22s -> 5472.22s]  I'm talking for a second.
[5472.22s -> 5474.39s]  Where is...
[5474.39s -> 5479.19s]  I feel like this is TTS
[5479.19s -> 5481.19s]  donations and you guys are on this
[5481.19s -> 5483.82s]  panic room meme. Okay.
[5483.82s -> 5488.60s]  So anyways, what the hell is just
[5488.60s -> 5493.78s]  coming out of my mouth? What were we talking about?
[5493.78s -> 5496.15s]  No, we're not talking about panic rooms.
[5496.15s -> 5498.15s]  We're talking about pizza.
[5498.15s -> 5501.67s]  We're talking about pizza.
[5501.67s -> 5504.74s]  Okay. That guy's wicked funny.
[5504.74s -> 5506.74s]  But not at the
[5506.74s -> 5509.56s]  exact moment when I'm talking about pizza.
[5509.56s -> 5512.18s]  Pepperoni. Like, okay, if you have like
[5512.18s -> 5514.18s]  mushrooms, onions, and peppers,
[5514.18s -> 5516.49s]  that's three items.
[5516.49s -> 5518.92s]  That's fine. Pepperoni, like
[5518.92s -> 5520.92s]  garlic and onion, that's fine.
[5520.92s -> 5522.92s]  Anything more than two or three and you just
[5522.92s -> 5525.48s]  come on. Just, you might as
[5525.48s -> 5533.80s]  well just make a lasagna. Seriously.
[5533.80s -> 5536.04s]  Items, small items are fine.
[5536.04s -> 5538.04s]  But more than three or four, it starts to become
[5538.04s -> 5542.90s]  too much for me. Garlic on pizza? Have you never
[5542.90s -> 5548.47s]  had garlic on pizza? Garlic and onion pizza.
[5548.47s -> 5550.47s]  Wait, you've never had garlic and onion pizza? What are you talking about?
[5550.47s -> 5555.19s]  That's kind of crazy. It's amazing.
[5555.19s -> 5558.84s]  You're going to ewe garlic.
[5558.84s -> 5560.84s]  I don't even listen
[5560.84s -> 5564.42s]  to that. Okay. So let me
[5564.42s -> 5568.71s]  try this again. Alright. Subtract.
[5568.71s -> 5578.42s]  How do I actually subtract it though?
[5578.42s -> 5589.18s]  Do I need to have this in here?
[5589.18s -> 5594.04s]  Invalid wall. Oh, okay.
[5594.04s -> 5597.50s]  You have to actually complete the room. I get it.
[5597.50s -> 5603.13s]  Oh yeah, it did not need to be that big.
[5603.13s -> 5605.13s]  So that's fine. Okay. So now I need a second one
[5605.13s -> 5609.61s]  of these. Sorry students,
[5609.61s -> 5616.12s]  you're going to have to move immediately.
[5616.12s -> 5618.12s]  I was going to say, what the hell have I done? That's fine.
[5618.12s -> 5625.72s]  Okay. Wait. That's
[5625.72s -> 5636.34s]  probably not a great idea.
[5636.34s -> 5639.61s]  Okay. I'm going to extend the bathroom a little bit.
[5639.61s -> 5654.63s]  Okay, that's fine. Now
[5654.63s -> 5656.94s]  I've got, I need a second
[5656.94s -> 5658.94s]  lecture hall, which is going to have to go down here.
[5658.94s -> 5662.31s]  Or maybe it could go here. Yeah, it could go here.
[5662.31s -> 5671.38s]  Under the door. No!
[5671.38s -> 5673.38s]  Okay, that's fine. And I'm going to take this
[5673.38s -> 5675.38s]  edge here. And the other lecture hall will go right here.
[5675.38s -> 5685.29s]  That's perfect. Much better.
[5685.29s -> 5691.42s]  Let's even this out. There's some shit in the way.
[5691.42s -> 5693.42s]  Look at this stupid hand sanitizer out here.
[5693.42s -> 5711.14s]  What are you doing? Alright, that's good.
[5711.14s -> 5726.82s]  I need a second one here. Oh, it's because of this door.
[5726.82s -> 5744.02s]  That's good. Okay, cool.
[5744.02s -> 5747.78s]  This is fun. Okay.
[5747.78s -> 5749.78s]  I'm going to get a ton of, they're going to get good grades.
[5749.78s -> 5755.21s]  Alright, here's another lecture theater.
[5755.21s -> 5759.11s]  This is lecture theater two. There it is.
[5759.11s -> 5762.94s]  Done. There we go. Alright.
[5762.94s -> 5765.88s]  Yeah!
[5765.88s -> 5772.34s]  I think I'm ready to start the year. Un-mirror the
[5772.34s -> 5774.34s]  thing. You look like an uncanny troll face.
[5774.34s -> 5779.78s]  You have to get over it.
[5779.78s -> 5781.78s]  Okay, let's hire some extra staff.
[5781.78s -> 5785.42s]  So we need a VR...
[5785.42s -> 5789.88s]  What's the difference between you two?
[5789.88s -> 5791.88s]  Moves faster than normal. Excellent personal hygiene.
[5791.88s -> 5794.89s]  Gets hungry easily. Gets thirsty
[5794.89s -> 5799.80s]  easily. You're fine. So we need
[5799.80s -> 5802.10s]  a VR technician.
[5802.10s -> 5807.08s]  We need... Should I get another
[5807.08s -> 5809.08s]  science teacher? Do we only have...
[5809.08s -> 5812.15s]  We already have one. Aerodynamics?
[5812.15s -> 5818.30s]  I definitely need another... Okay, I need a
[5818.30s -> 5820.60s]  library assistant. Yeah,
[5820.60s -> 5825.27s]  okay, you're good. Okay, so that's two
[5825.27s -> 5827.64s]  and then maybe one more janitor. I don't want to lose
[5827.64s -> 5830.20s]  I don't want to blow my money. Your head looks
[5830.20s -> 5842.55s]  like a slice of pizza. Alright, now what I need
[5842.55s -> 5847.42s]  to make this look a little nicer.
[5847.42s -> 5852.41s]  This is so barren out here.
[5852.41s -> 5855.48s]  What are the needs? Table, football,
[5855.48s -> 5857.85s]  wanted. I need a hundred coins.
[5857.85s -> 5860.28s]  Tree bench. I need a hundred coins.
[5860.28s -> 5864.10s]  Can't do it right now. I'm sorry.
[5864.10s -> 5866.10s]  Table, football, tree bench. I don't
[5866.10s -> 5874.34s]  have it. Alright, well, I gotta put like
[5874.34s -> 5876.34s]  some cool decorations.
[5876.34s -> 5883.75s]  How about this one? And then... What's this?
[5883.75s -> 5904.09s]  Oh, a fountain. I don't want to overdo
[5904.09s -> 5912.41s]  it. Seating like right outside. This is like
[5912.41s -> 5919.19s]  a good place to have it. That looks good.
[5919.19s -> 5924.87s]  That looks great. This is shitload of items.
[5924.87s -> 5929.66s]  There's actually a lot. Okay. What's this?
[5929.66s -> 5932.15s]  Paths and terrain.
[5932.15s -> 5935.34s]  Oh, okay. Alright.
[5935.34s -> 5940.46s]  Manage courses. I think we're ready.
[5940.46s -> 5947.03s]  Ready to go? Should I have some seating in here?
[5947.03s -> 5951.64s]  Alright, I can't even put... Wait, what about sofa?
[5951.64s -> 5956.74s]  Couch. Let's go.
[5956.74s -> 5965.58s]  It's time to start the academic year.
[5965.58s -> 5969.03s]  What am I doing wrong here?
[5969.03s -> 5978.42s]  Here we go. Are you sure you want to start
[5978.42s -> 5981.30s]  the year with the following courses?
[5981.30s -> 5988.02s]  Yes. Oh!
[5988.02s -> 5990.02s]  What is... Okay, it's literally... Alright.
[5990.02s -> 5992.02s]  That... What the fuck is that?
[5992.02s -> 5994.02s]  And why is it floating around the light?
[5994.02s -> 5998.89s]  I just got scared by like a hair.
[5998.89s -> 6004.65s]  There was this big dust bunny that was
[6004.65s -> 6006.65s]  floating around and it like got attracted to the ring light.
[6006.65s -> 6009.08s]  At least I think that's what that was.
[6009.08s -> 6037.86s]  Can you see this?
[6037.86s -> 6039.86s]  That floated up into the light and
[6039.86s -> 6043.13s]  casted a shadow. And it was
[6043.13s -> 6045.13s]  horrifying. I thought I was
[6045.13s -> 6051.53s]  getting attacked by an insect. It's just
[6051.53s -> 6053.53s]  dust. Yeah, I know, but it floated by the ring light
[6053.53s -> 6055.53s]  and casted this massive
[6055.53s -> 6059.43s]  shadow. You made a Lord Voldemort
[6059.43s -> 6061.43s]  sound.
[6061.43s -> 6071.53s]  Alright, new year, let's do it.
[6071.53s -> 6074.34s]  Welcome students. We've got more
[6074.34s -> 6077.61s]  classes here. We've got a nice
[6077.61s -> 6080.36s]  place to hang out. We've also got...
[6080.36s -> 6083.94s]  That's cheating.
[6083.94s -> 6093.46s]  Let's go to the toilet.
[6097.46s -> 6100.52s]  Alright.
[6100.52s -> 6102.52s]  We have a relationship forming between
[6102.52s -> 6104.52s]  The academic year is starting.
[6104.52s -> 6106.52s]  Wolfric Halfmoon
[6106.52s -> 6109.66s]  and
[6109.66s -> 6111.66s]  Randy Fenderson.
[6111.66s -> 6115.86s]  Students, virtual normality.
[6115.86s -> 6120.73s]  I think I can only have 20
[6120.73s -> 6127.00s]  students. Alright, come check out the
[6127.00s -> 6129.00s]  dorm room, man. It's pretty sick.
[6129.00s -> 6131.56s]  Yeah, I remember Benny Bungle from year
[6131.56s -> 6136.10s]  one. Yeah, trying the hats, man.
[6136.10s -> 6138.73s]  Check out the clown trunk too
[6138.73s -> 6143.91s]  when you have a chance. There are way
[6143.91s -> 6145.91s]  too many students. We only have two classes.
[6145.91s -> 6150.46s]  Two students have a
[6150.46s -> 6152.46s]  personal goal of wanting to sit on a park
[6152.46s -> 6159.93s]  bench. I mean,
[6159.93s -> 6167.29s]  really? That's a
[6167.29s -> 6169.29s]  goal of yours is to sit on a park bench.
[6169.29s -> 6172.94s]  I mean, I'm not going to deny you that. That's
[6172.94s -> 6174.94s]  fine.
[6174.94s -> 6176.94s]  Here, go
[6176.94s -> 6179.82s]  fulfill your greatest
[6179.82s -> 6184.87s]  desire. Where are the teachers?
[6184.87s -> 6193.83s]  What's wrong?
[6193.83s -> 6196.46s]  Learning rate, 118%
[6196.46s -> 6198.46s]  textbook cubicle required.
[6198.46s -> 6200.76s]  Get to class, hurry up.
[6200.76s -> 6204.09s]  Wait, Benny, the teacher.
[6204.09s -> 6206.09s]  Oh, the students are in here unsupervised.
[6206.09s -> 6211.66s]  How many teachers do I have?
[6211.66s -> 6215.75s]  Jerma, the VR students are making
[6215.75s -> 6217.75s]  porn. You have to stop them.
[6217.75s -> 6234.58s]  Students are asked not to ask questions.
[6234.58s -> 6236.58s]  Oh, you got an intelligence
[6236.58s -> 6238.58s]  boost. They're definitely going to end up
[6238.58s -> 6243.19s]  with a C, right? Uh oh.
[6243.19s -> 6250.54s]  There's only 10 room capacity.
[6250.54s -> 6255.14s]  One, two, three, four, five, six,
[6255.14s -> 6257.14s]  seven, eight, nine, ten. Yo,
[6257.14s -> 6259.14s]  how do I add more people?
[6259.14s -> 6262.92s]  You're doing a
[6262.92s -> 6264.92s]  broom on the sofa?
[6264.92s -> 6273.05s]  I thought that, did you see that fly by the
[6273.05s -> 6275.05s]  screen? Did you see it? You saw that,
[6275.05s -> 6279.38s]  right? Make the room bigger.
[6279.38s -> 6288.02s]  Nobody's going to the library. They're all just
[6288.02s -> 6290.02s]  goofing off in the hangout room.
[6290.02s -> 6299.75s]  You could hear a pin drop.
[6301.75s -> 6303.75s]  Look at this.
[6303.75s -> 6306.18s]  Look at this. Come on.
[6306.18s -> 6308.49s]  No one wants to study.
[6308.49s -> 6313.99s]  Oh my goodness.
[6313.99s -> 6319.93s]  Hot dog kiosk?
[6319.93s -> 6321.93s]  This might be frightfully exciting for you. The people of
[6321.93s -> 6323.93s]  Freshly now have a second thing to be proud of.
[6323.93s -> 6326.94s]  Congratulations and so on.
[6326.94s -> 6328.94s]  Don't be too complacent. This is your first campus
[6328.94s -> 6330.94s]  and it shows.
[6330.94s -> 6332.94s]  Alright, I have a new, I can do a new college.
[6332.94s -> 6338.38s]  I unlocked a hot dog machine.
[6338.38s -> 6345.61s]  So we're the,
[6345.61s -> 6354.82s]  we got that from a different campus.
[6354.82s -> 6356.82s]  Alright, no more like just potato chips
[6356.82s -> 6358.82s]  and sodas.
[6363.69s -> 6370.54s]  Could this be outside?
[6370.54s -> 6372.54s]  Maybe this shouldn't be inside here.
[6372.54s -> 6380.28s]  That would actually be amazing though.
[6380.28s -> 6384.38s]  Do you know? Okay, somebody confirm this to me.
[6384.38s -> 6386.62s]  I've heard
[6386.62s -> 6388.62s]  just randomly through
[6388.62s -> 6390.62s]  various people and stuff.
[6390.62s -> 6392.62s]  Has any of you guys ever heard of this?
[6392.62s -> 6394.62s]  Of like a restaurant being in your school?
[6394.62s -> 6397.05s]  Like a McDonald's?
[6397.05s -> 6399.05s]  Or like a fast food place?
[6399.05s -> 6401.93s]  Being like in the school?
[6401.93s -> 6405.77s]  Or like a Starbucks or something?
[6405.77s -> 6407.77s]  Yes, that happens. A subway. We had a subway.
[6407.77s -> 6411.67s]  We had a subway.
[6411.67s -> 6417.03s]  If there was like a
[6417.03s -> 6419.03s]  McDonald's in between the science room
[6419.03s -> 6421.03s]  and the math room, I would have been there all the time.
[6421.03s -> 6423.21s]  There's a Dunkin' Donuts here.
[6423.21s -> 6428.63s]  Really?
[6428.63s -> 6430.63s]  That sounds amazing.
[6430.63s -> 6432.63s]  We had a deli but not a brand name.
[6432.63s -> 6434.63s]  We had a Taco Bell, Wendy's, Arby's, Dunkin' and a Panera.
[6434.63s -> 6436.63s]  That sounds incredible.
[6436.63s -> 6440.15s]  So you tell me, you could like go out of
[6440.15s -> 6442.15s]  your logic class
[6442.15s -> 6444.15s]  and they would just be a Starbucks
[6444.15s -> 6446.15s]  in the fucking building
[6446.15s -> 6456.84s]  right there.
[6456.84s -> 6459.72s]  In College Univer- yeah.
[6459.72s -> 6461.72s]  That sounds amazing. It's a separate building?
[6461.72s -> 6468.50s]  How far though?
[6468.50s -> 6473.18s]  Corporate takeover.
[6473.18s -> 6475.18s]  Bro, just walk to the fast food.
[6475.18s -> 6477.18s]  But how convenient is that?
[6477.18s -> 6479.18s]  If I can walk out of the lecture hall
[6479.18s -> 6481.18s]  and there's just a Burger King here.
[6481.18s -> 6483.98s]  It's just like-
[6483.98s -> 6485.98s]  Alright, I'm getting a number two.
[6485.98s -> 6487.98s]  Let's go. I'm ready.
[6487.98s -> 6492.01s]  That would be so awesome.
[6492.01s -> 6494.31s]  I would have become such a fat- fuck.
[6494.31s -> 6497.77s]  I really would have been.
[6497.77s -> 6500.58s]  We had a Papa John's in the cafeteria.
[6500.58s -> 6505.69s]  That's so unfair.
[6505.69s -> 6508.18s]  We had a food court.
[6508.18s -> 6510.18s]  Yeah, that would be amazing.
[6510.18s -> 6512.18s]  If there was like three or four different restaurants
[6512.18s -> 6518.25s]  in the campus hall, what happened to you?
[6518.25s -> 6523.30s]  You just did something cool. What did you do?
[6523.30s -> 6526.95s]  Good grades?
[6526.95s -> 6531.24s]  Friends with Charlie Leotard.
[6531.24s -> 6537.32s]  Alright, they're friends.
[6537.32s -> 6539.32s]  Maybe it was a bad idea to have
[6539.32s -> 6541.32s]  the fucking hot dog kiosk.
[6541.32s -> 6543.32s]  Nobody's doing well.
[6543.32s -> 6546.58s]  He's holding his ass.
[6546.58s -> 6548.58s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[6548.58s -> 6551.46s]  He's walking like this.
[6551.46s -> 6553.70s]  He's holding his ass.
[6553.70s -> 6555.70s]  They all have stomachaches and they're gonna shit their pants.
[6560.25s -> 6562.25s]  Now everybody wants to go into the library.
[6562.25s -> 6564.25s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[6566.25s -> 6568.62s]  Oh, no.
[6568.62s -> 6572.78s]  What do I do?
[6572.78s -> 6576.49s]  There's too many people.
[6576.49s -> 6578.49s]  You're either gonna study or you're gonna get up.
[6578.49s -> 6580.49s]  Don't sleep.
[6580.49s -> 6582.49s]  Sleep in your bed.
[6584.98s -> 6586.98s]  No, don't sleep. Get up.
[6586.98s -> 6591.98s]  You've been expelled.
[6605.74s -> 6615.21s]  No.
[6615.21s -> 6617.21s]  What, a dictator? No, dude.
[6617.21s -> 6624.82s]  It's not enough room.
[6624.82s -> 6627.90s]  They're crying.
[6627.90s -> 6629.90s]  Wait, do I have coins? No?
[6629.90s -> 6639.18s]  I do. Okay, I got 200 coins.
[6639.18s -> 6641.54s]  Tree bench.
[6641.54s -> 6643.54s]  Why do you guys want benches so bad?
[6643.54s -> 6645.54s]  The most boring shit.
[6645.54s -> 6648.04s]  Ask for like a pinball machine.
[6648.04s -> 6651.82s]  I really would love a bench.
[6651.82s -> 6653.82s]  What do you mean a bench?
[6653.82s -> 6655.82s]  Ask for like a dozen pinball machines.
[6655.82s -> 6660.30s]  Ask for a McDonald's across from the campus.
[6660.30s -> 6663.50s]  Look, we have plenty of benches.
[6663.50s -> 6667.50s]  I count one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[6667.50s -> 6672.87s]  Why do you want another bench?
[6672.87s -> 6674.87s]  Please put a bench, please.
[6674.87s -> 6678.97s]  It's $4,000.
[6678.97s -> 6680.97s]  Oh, wait, this is like a romantic bench.
[6680.97s -> 6691.46s]  All right, let's put it like here.
[6691.46s -> 6698.81s]  Who's gonna use it?
[6698.81s -> 6700.81s]  Develop romances, dating, sweethearts.
[6700.81s -> 6703.18s]  All right, there we go.
[6703.18s -> 6709.32s]  Somebody's like, wait, we want this
[6709.32s -> 6711.32s]  because, well, do you want to tell the story?
[6711.32s -> 6714.52s]  No, I can't.
[6714.52s -> 6716.52s]  I guess you have to be there.
[6716.52s -> 6720.42s]  This is getting ripped up and put into the fucking recycling.
[6720.42s -> 6722.42s]  Like, I'm sorry.
[6722.42s -> 6724.60s]  If you have like a formal request and you're gonna send me to like the dean of students,
[6724.60s -> 6727.10s]  this is not how you write it.
[6727.10s -> 6730.30s]  Hey, we want table football.
[6730.30s -> 6732.30s]  I think a lot of the students would like it.
[6732.30s -> 6734.30s]  Actually, a lot of the people on the football team
[6734.30s -> 6736.30s]  said that they thought it was fun to maybe
[6736.30s -> 6738.30s]  just shoot the shit and hang out.
[6738.30s -> 6740.30s]  There's not a lot of stuff in the
[6740.30s -> 6742.30s]  recreation room so far.
[6742.30s -> 6750.87s]  This is not how you write to the dean.
[6750.87s -> 6752.87s]  I request this article of the night with no
[6752.87s -> 6754.87s]  with which to strengthen the moon's power.
[6754.87s -> 6758.78s]  Oh, please, I think it would be lovely.
[6758.78s -> 6765.50s]  This person's expelled.
[6765.50s -> 6767.74s]  Where are they?
[6767.74s -> 6769.74s]  Where are they?
[6769.74s -> 6774.98s]  I'm gonna put the poster right in front of them.
[6774.98s -> 6783.75s]  There you are. Look!
[6783.75s -> 6787.85s]  I gave you the
[6787.85s -> 6789.85s]  haunted Halloween poster.
[6789.85s -> 6815.75s]  Oh, nobody works here.
[6815.75s -> 6824.06s]  Where are you going?
[6824.06s -> 6829.05s]  I was gonna expel you if you threw that on the ground.
[6829.05s -> 6831.05s]  I was gonna hover over the expel button.
[6831.05s -> 6835.21s]  There you go.
[6835.21s -> 6844.04s]  Here comes the needs meter filling up.
[6844.04s -> 6848.20s]  Nice. Look at how happy you are.
[6848.20s -> 6852.17s]  Now go get an A. Dark aura.
[6852.17s -> 6860.86s]  That was a violent
[6860.86s -> 6862.86s]  door close.
[6862.86s -> 6867.19s]  How are we doing? Somebody has to work here.
[6867.19s -> 6873.21s]  I need an assistant. Somebody's gonna open this
[6873.21s -> 6879.40s]  kiosk. Wait. Oh, shit.
[6879.40s -> 6881.64s]  Isn't that person working at the library?
[6881.64s -> 6886.06s]  Where's my staff menu?
[6888.36s -> 6893.22s]  Yeah, I need another staff member.
[6893.22s -> 6899.11s]  I need more assistance. No, no, no.
[6899.11s -> 6901.11s]  I'm going for it. I got it.
[6901.11s -> 6905.27s]  Somebody can do food.
[6905.27s -> 6909.80s]  Can you do food?
[6909.80s -> 6913.38s]  Do they have to have food as a trait? Can anybody do it?
[6913.38s -> 6923.05s]  Or do you have to have food as a trait?
[6923.05s -> 6927.53s]  I think anybody can do it, right?
[6927.53s -> 6934.25s]  You're hired.
[6934.25s -> 6937.64s]  Get in there.
[6937.64s -> 6944.81s]  Where'd they go? Where'd that person go?
[6944.81s -> 6951.19s]  Did they just hire someone?
[6951.19s -> 6963.99s]  Oh, they're just in the staff room.
[6963.99s -> 6969.67s]  Alright, that's fine.
[6969.67s -> 6971.67s]  48, 46, 45.
[6971.67s -> 6973.67s]  What's why these people...
[6973.67s -> 6979.54s]  What's that mean? Why? What's gonna happen?
[6979.54s -> 6984.92s]  What happens if this goes to zero?
[6984.92s -> 7002.87s]  You're expelled. Hurry.
[7002.87s -> 7006.01s]  How do I pause?
[7006.01s -> 7008.01s]  Alright, alright, alright. They want textbook cubicle?
[7008.01s -> 7013.19s]  Oh, there's only one
[7013.19s -> 7028.17s]  in the whole college. Oh, there's not
[7028.17s -> 7030.79s]  one in the entire university.
[7030.79s -> 7043.21s]  Okay, I get it. There! Your demands
[7043.21s -> 7047.88s]  have been met. Is that okay?
[7047.88s -> 7050.95s]  You're gonna get rid of your little
[7050.95s -> 7056.58s]  countdown thing here?
[7056.58s -> 7059.14s]  There, see? Where is this person?
[7059.14s -> 7066.18s]  This person's been sitting in the break room.
[7066.18s -> 7071.43s]  Why are you just sitting here?
[7071.43s -> 7081.16s]  Who works where?
[7081.16s -> 7090.42s]  Weeds. There's only like one weed
[7090.42s -> 7093.62s]  on the whole thing. Alright, that's fine.
[7093.62s -> 7096.89s]  This is looking good. Looks good,
[7096.89s -> 7098.89s]  looks good, looks good, looks good.
[7098.89s -> 7101.45s]  Is there a face swap filter on?
[7101.45s -> 7105.34s]  Oh, it's kinda laggy.
[7105.34s -> 7115.26s]  Hold on.
[7115.26s -> 7126.70s]  That's not better.
[7126.70s -> 7129.32s]  Look at my eyes!
[7129.32s -> 7139.16s]  Why do they look so weird?
[7139.16s -> 7141.16s]  That's better. Not really, but whatever. I don't care.
[7141.16s -> 7147.37s]  Take off the troll chin.
[7147.37s -> 7155.50s]  That's just my face, man. You're very
[7155.50s -> 7157.50s]  blue. I think it's the action movie
[7157.50s -> 7159.93s]  filter. Okay, so you guys have gotten
[7159.93s -> 7161.93s]  used to this filter. Let's turn it off.
[7161.93s -> 7164.55s]  People are gonna be very surprised. You ready?
[7164.55s -> 7178.10s]  Yuck.
[7178.10s -> 7199.40s]  By the way, Two Point Campus is
[7199.40s -> 7202.66s]  on. Nintendo Switch.
[7202.66s -> 7206.87s]  It's on. Xbox.
[7206.87s -> 7209.50s]  It's on.
[7209.50s -> 7212.06s]  PlayStation 5.
[7212.06s -> 7214.06s]  It's also on.
[7214.06s -> 7216.06s]  P P P P P P P P P P P
[7216.06s -> 7225.14s]  P C D P P P C.
[7225.14s -> 7228.15s]  This hurts my head. Wait, can you like see
[7228.15s -> 7234.68s]  like the heat profile of my face?
[7234.68s -> 7237.24s]  Look at my eyes.
[7237.24s -> 7245.88s]  Holy shit, that looks weird.
[7245.88s -> 7247.88s]  You can see like the heat in my eyes.
[7247.88s -> 7267.06s]  That's terrifying.
[7267.06s -> 7269.06s]  I'm back. Nice heat detector.
[7269.06s -> 7272.58s]  That's not thermal. Wait, whatever.
[7272.58s -> 7279.37s]  Alright, let's keep going. And yes, this is by the
[7279.37s -> 7283.78s]  same people that did Two Point Hospital.
[7283.78s -> 7285.78s]  I sss...stop asking it!
[7285.78s -> 7287.78s]  Stop asking it! I see it every five seconds.
[7287.78s -> 7296.23s]  This college is bumping!
[7296.23s -> 7298.23s]  Please change your passwords. Sorry.
[7298.23s -> 7304.63s]  I have showers, right?
[7304.63s -> 7313.14s]  Yep. I actually might need
[7313.14s -> 7320.89s]  I need more classrooms.
[7320.89s -> 7322.89s]  Yeah, I need like another two or three
[7322.89s -> 7325.77s]  I need more classes. I need more professors.
[7325.77s -> 7328.52s]  Should I hire another professor?
[7328.52s -> 7333.00s]  Okay, we need a VR teacher.
[7333.00s -> 7335.00s]  No, I don't want to replace this person. That person was doing fine.
[7335.00s -> 7340.95s]  Wait, you just threw trash on the ground?
[7340.95s -> 7349.59s]  You're not going to leave, are you?
[7349.59s -> 7357.77s]  It's okay. I don't know what to do with you.
[7357.77s -> 7366.65s]  Where are the students?
[7366.65s -> 7369.14s]  Oh god, there's so many requests.
[7369.14s -> 7371.45s]  Please give us a coffee kiosk.
[7371.45s -> 7373.45s]  Please give us a crescent bench.
[7373.45s -> 7375.45s]  Please give us two-player game tables.
[7375.45s -> 7379.35s]  Give us a love bench. Okay, fine.
[7382.04s -> 7384.04s]  Okay, what else?
[7384.04s -> 7386.22s]  I feel like Bruce Almighty.
[7386.22s -> 7388.22s]  What else do you want?
[7388.22s -> 7390.65s]  Family tree wanted.
[7390.65s -> 7392.65s]  Okay, fine. I'll put this in the dorm.
[7392.65s -> 7402.81s]  Okay, there you go.
[7402.81s -> 7404.81s]  Oh, Statement of the Year.
[7404.81s -> 7407.18s]  12,000 profit.
[7407.18s -> 7412.87s]  That's good.
[7412.87s -> 7414.87s]  It would ruin my reputation if anyone knew I was talking to the Big Cheese.
[7414.87s -> 7416.87s]  But listen, I really want one of these.
[7416.87s -> 7422.50s]  Alright.
[7422.50s -> 7427.05s]  Oh, cool. Yeah, I'll put it here.
[7427.05s -> 7429.67s]  You want a bench?
[7429.67s -> 7431.67s]  Alright, here's your bench.
[7431.67s -> 7438.70s]  Can I put this anywhere?
[7438.70s -> 7440.70s]  Tuition fees are expensive.
[7440.70s -> 7442.70s]  And education is priceless.
[7447.30s -> 7449.30s]  Somebody even walks over here.
[7449.30s -> 7451.30s]  He's going to sit on this random bench in the corner.
[7451.30s -> 7454.55s]  Okay.
[7454.55s -> 7456.55s]  Two-player game table.
[7456.55s -> 7459.62s]  This is a big one.
[7459.62s -> 7464.42s]  These two want to hang out.
[7464.42s -> 7488.22s]  Alright, this is going. Pause it.
[7488.22s -> 7490.58s]  There we go. That's fine. That fits.
[7490.58s -> 7498.46s]  I should move this in the corner.
[7498.46s -> 7500.46s]  Nobody wants to play darts.
[7500.46s -> 7511.27s]  I haven't seen anybody play it once.
[7511.27s -> 7514.22s]  I think the two-player game table will be more popular than darts right now.
[7514.22s -> 7518.18s]  Yeah, it will.
[7518.18s -> 7522.15s]  Darts is cool, but people are requesting this.
[7524.97s -> 7531.29s]  Look, happy.
[7531.29s -> 7533.29s]  Very happy.
[7533.29s -> 7535.29s]  Oh, man. I love a nice coffee.
[7535.29s -> 7537.53s]  I love a nice coffee from a kiosk.
[7537.53s -> 7541.18s]  I'll put this right here.
[7541.18s -> 7543.18s]  You know how amazing this would be?
[7543.18s -> 7547.02s]  Right in front of the door.
[7547.02s -> 7563.26s]  Perfect.
[7563.26s -> 7566.58s]  That's much better.
[7566.58s -> 7568.58s]  Wait, I need another person to work here.
[7568.58s -> 7575.99s]  Someone will take care of it.
[7575.99s -> 7577.99s]  Alright, so far so good. What about my goals?
[7577.99s -> 7581.94s]  Career goals.
[7581.94s -> 7583.94s]  Level up 100 Scientography students.
[7583.94s -> 7590.20s]  Alright, I'll take it.
[7590.20s -> 7592.20s]  Anybody using the benches?
[7592.20s -> 7594.20s]  You look italicized.
[7605.54s -> 7607.54s]  Dude, don't run to the bathroom in class.
[7614.78s -> 7616.78s]  Do not piss into the chemical generator.
[7616.78s -> 7621.06s]  You look askew.
[7621.06s -> 7627.72s]  I don't know why.
[7627.72s -> 7630.02s]  I need another worker.
[7630.02s -> 7641.35s]  I'm in profit right now, so that's fine.
[7641.35s -> 7647.24s]  Where are you going?
[7647.24s -> 7651.96s]  Looking for work?
[7651.96s -> 7657.78s]  Can you not fit here?
[7659.78s -> 7661.78s]  Finally, somebody's here.
[7661.78s -> 7667.10s]  Alright, who wants a hot dog?
[7667.10s -> 7674.20s]  I could go for a hot dog right now.
[7674.20s -> 7678.87s]  I could go for a hot dog right now.
[7678.87s -> 7684.62s]  Three. Just three hot dogs.
[7684.62s -> 7688.46s]  Mustard.
[7688.46s -> 7690.76s]  Ketchup, Tabasco on the third one.
[7690.76s -> 7693.58s]  Mustard, mustard on the first two.
[7693.58s -> 7695.58s]  Ketchup and Tabasco on the third one.
[7695.58s -> 7699.48s]  That's it. Don't put anything else on it.
[7699.48s -> 7702.49s]  That sounds amazing.
[7702.49s -> 7706.52s]  That sounds so good.
[7706.52s -> 7709.02s]  Are you doing the class in a VR helmet?
[7709.02s -> 7711.02s]  That's awesome.
[7711.02s -> 7717.74s]  What's your performance like?
[7717.74s -> 7719.74s]  Are you happy?
[7719.74s -> 7725.05s]  Low energy.
[7731.62s -> 7734.50s]  How's everybody doing?
[7734.50s -> 7736.50s]  Alright, I need campus level nine.
[7736.50s -> 7739.51s]  Average dorm rating. Almost there.
[7739.51s -> 7741.51s]  Quick, add some more
[7741.51s -> 7743.51s]  Nintendo consoles and shit.
[7743.51s -> 7746.33s]  Hold on.
[7746.33s -> 7748.33s]  Rose Garden.
[7748.33s -> 7754.65s]  Hold on. Wait.
[7754.65s -> 7774.30s]  Dorm rating. We need some more stuff in here.
[7774.30s -> 7777.30s]  I need some...
[7777.30s -> 7781.02s]  Electric guitar.
[7781.02s -> 7785.42s]  We need 70%.
[7785.42s -> 7790.52s]  There it is. Rug.
[7790.52s -> 7805.48s]  Another sanitizer.
[7805.48s -> 7824.23s]  Come on! God damn it.
[7824.23s -> 7831.26s]  I didn't get it. Alright, how'd we do?
[7831.26s -> 7833.50s]  Did we do good?
[7833.50s -> 7835.50s]  I think we did okay.
[7835.50s -> 7845.98s]  I think we did alright.
[7845.98s -> 7848.22s]  Oh, that's right. I did that.
[7848.22s -> 7850.22s]  Everyone's got a C+.
[7850.22s -> 7863.72s]  That's passing grade. That's fine.
[7863.72s -> 7865.72s]  Everyone has a 77%.
[7865.72s -> 7868.98s]  97%.
[7868.98s -> 7870.98s]  97% pass rate. I expelled somebody.
[7872.98s -> 7874.98s]  Alright, so now what?
[7874.98s -> 7878.31s]  I can't believe I didn't get that.
[7878.31s -> 7883.43s]  Thanks a lot.
[7883.43s -> 7885.43s]  We sold one hot dog.
[7885.43s -> 7891.69s]  Are there new courses?
[7891.69s -> 7894.95s]  Wait, I can upgrade.
[7894.95s -> 7896.95s]  I want to check out the other campus.
[7896.95s -> 7904.62s]  Okay, here we go.
[7904.62s -> 7907.50s]  That's cool.
[7907.50s -> 7909.50s]  How do I get to see the campus?
[7909.50s -> 7916.07s]  Build more beds for the rating?
[7916.07s -> 7918.07s]  Hold on, I want to check out the other...
[7918.07s -> 7927.16s]  I unlocked another campus. Exit to map?
[7927.16s -> 7929.16s]  Oh, here it is. Save.
[7929.16s -> 7938.23s]  Okay.
[7938.23s -> 7940.23s]  Piazza Lanatra is now available.
[7940.23s -> 7946.10s]  Let's check it out.
[7946.10s -> 7948.10s]  Countryside college is low expectations and a nice
[7948.10s -> 7950.10s]  canal. It's the perfect place to start your career.
[7950.10s -> 7954.70s]  Let's check it out.
[7954.70s -> 7956.70s]  Bring back the... Oh, forgot I deleted the panic room guy.
[7956.70s -> 7959.13s]  I should definitely bring him back.
[7959.13s -> 7963.93s]  I'm not sure exactly where I can get
[7963.93s -> 7965.93s]  this awesome looking game.
[7965.93s -> 7969.43s]  Well, I'm really glad you asked.
[7969.43s -> 7971.43s]  Two Point Campus is available on Steam.
[7971.43s -> 7973.43s]  It's on the Xbox, PlayStation.
[7973.43s -> 7975.43s]  It's on Switch. It's pretty much every
[7975.43s -> 7977.99s]  major platform you could possibly imagine.
[7977.99s -> 7981.38s]  Also,
[7981.38s -> 7983.38s]  there's a link in the chat that's
[7983.38s -> 7987.74s]  being shown.
[7987.74s -> 7989.74s]  Obviously, there's a panel down there you can click the link to if you want.
[7989.74s -> 7991.74s]  Just go to Steam.
[7991.74s -> 7994.36s]  It's on Steam.
[7994.36s -> 7996.36s]  I mean,
[7996.36s -> 7998.36s]  you can
[7998.36s -> 8000.36s]  get it. I think it's good.
[8000.36s -> 8003.62s]  You can get it on Switch.
[8003.62s -> 8005.62s]  My only talking points that I've said all...
[8005.62s -> 8007.62s]  It's just like you can get it on Switch.
[8007.62s -> 8009.62s]  You can get it on Xbox.
[8009.62s -> 8011.62s]  You can get it on the Switch. Hey, by the way,
[8011.62s -> 8013.62s]  you can get it on the Switch.
[8013.62s -> 8017.53s]  I want to see the
[8017.53s -> 8021.30s]  relationship system.
[8021.30s -> 8028.28s]  It's important. Where's the people that
[8028.28s -> 8032.06s]  requested this?
[8032.06s -> 8035.38s]  Oh, panic room guy, right.
[8035.38s -> 8037.94s]  Two Point Hospital was fun, too.
[8037.94s -> 8039.94s]  If you liked Two Point Hospital,
[8039.94s -> 8041.94s]  and you were like, damn, I kind of wish Two Point Hospital
[8041.94s -> 8043.94s]  was like a college simulator game,
[8043.94s -> 8047.08s]  this is the game for you. It's clean.
[8047.08s -> 8049.64s]  It's fun. It's cute.
[8049.64s -> 8051.64s]  Seems like there's a lot to do.
[8051.64s -> 8057.98s]  And why am I here? Did I pick the same
[8057.98s -> 8070.52s]  place? Oh, I was like,
[8070.52s -> 8080.50s]  what? Didn't I pick it? It should be a
[8080.50s -> 8085.37s]  weed dealer. This is more of a
[8085.37s -> 8089.14s]  city.
[8103.77s -> 8105.77s]  Wait, there are clubs in this game?
[8107.77s -> 8109.77s]  There's like clubs.
[8109.77s -> 8111.77s]  There's no way that that's a real picture.
[8111.77s -> 8113.77s]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[8113.77s -> 8116.39s]  What picture? You mean the up here?
[8116.39s -> 8122.60s]  Wait, what do you mean?
[8122.60s -> 8127.34s]  I mean, you're very obviously like
[8127.34s -> 8138.47s]  fucked with this. I mean, if you do it
[8138.47s -> 8163.61s]  subtly enough, I get it.
[8163.61s -> 8165.61s]  You can make me believe something, but
[8165.61s -> 8174.06s]  you're not going to make me believe this is a real picture.
[8174.06s -> 8176.06s]  I mean, you're very obviously like
[8176.06s -> 8178.30s]  fucked with this. I mean, if you do it
[8178.30s -> 8180.30s]  subtly enough, I get it. You can make me believe something, but
[8180.30s -> 8182.30s]  you're not going to make me believe this is a real picture
[8182.30s -> 8184.86s]  in the state this currently is in right now.
[8184.86s -> 8187.74s]  You just not.
[8187.74s -> 8190.30s]  Oh, dude.
[8190.30s -> 8194.07s]  Real picture, this is what you look like.
[8194.07s -> 8196.07s]  That's not serious. You have to make it at least believable.
[8196.07s -> 8210.22s]  That's not very believable at all.
[8210.22s -> 8212.22s]  You bulged my
[8212.22s -> 8214.22s]  eyes out.
[8214.22s -> 8216.22s]  Look! You can even see the Photoshop fucking
[8216.22s -> 8218.46s]  smudge tool. Excuse me.
[8218.46s -> 8220.46s]  Yeah, I can see
[8220.46s -> 8222.46s]  the smudge tool that you dragged my face
[8222.46s -> 8227.70s]  Look and see the darkness you use the Photoshop tool.
[8227.70s -> 8233.82s]  You got to cover your tracks better than that.
[8233.82s -> 8234.82s]  Yeah.
[8234.82s -> 8248.73s]  Students are reminded such thing as free time.
[8248.73s -> 8249.73s]  Okay.
[8249.73s -> 8250.73s]  Hello there.
[8250.73s -> 8255.81s]  I'm DJ.
[8255.81s -> 8257.88s]  Wait.
[8257.88s -> 8258.88s]  Oh, okay.
[8258.88s -> 8259.88s]  DJ Sue Chef.
[8259.88s -> 8264.52s]  You'll find my restaurant and nightclub beat root right here in Piazza Lanotrara.
[8264.52s -> 8268.72s]  I'm here to help turn your student body into a bodacious stew of learning.
[8268.72s -> 8270.36s]  Welcome to the culinary world.
[8270.36s -> 8271.36s]  It's going to be delicious.
[8271.36s -> 8273.11s]  Where's the college?
[8274.86s -> 8275.86s]  It's a pretty cool campus.
[8279.58s -> 8284.15s]  Oh.
[8284.15s -> 8285.15s]  I guess it's all right.
[8285.15s -> 8292.84s]  Oh a savoury kitchen.
[8292.84s -> 8306.31s]  Here it comes.

[9709.58s -> 9716.69s]  don't get me wrong do not twist my words around I love eggs over medium eggs over
[9716.69s -> 9721.30s]  kind of from easy to medium is perfect how many times I have to have this
[9721.30s -> 9727.70s]  conversation with everybody here I don't know how many times I have to tell you
[9727.82s -> 9733.15s]  to be pleased while others must be when you have a plate of food entirely what
[9733.15s -> 9738.15s]  we do know is that hold on he has triumphed meaning that yet again the
[9738.15s -> 9741.63s]  people of two point come on I want to hear what he says what they asked for

[9756.81s -> 9762.23s]  thing you eat if you have a meal whether it's breakfast whether it's you know
[9762.23s -> 9767.83s]  brunch or lunch whatever you put your eggs on eggs is not the only thing that
[9767.83s -> 9774.70s]  you have on the plate so there's usually eggs bacon sausage tomato toast you know
[9774.70s -> 9781.06s]  what doesn't matter whatever's there if you have a runny egg you when you touch
[9781.06s -> 9788.06s]  the yolk it just explodes and gets on every single other piece of food it just
[9788.18s -> 9792.06s]  kind of gets everywhere and then it starts congealing and gets hard and
[9792.06s -> 9797.27s]  weird over medium is perfect and over easy to over medium somewhere in the
[9797.27s -> 9802.47s]  middle because the egg is still kind of runny and jammy and soft but it doesn't
[9802.47s -> 9806.58s]  just explode everywhere and then turn to this mess on your plate that's the point
[9806.58s -> 9811.50s]  but I don't want just egg yolk all over everything else that I'm eating I want
[9811.50s -> 9816.66s]  to choose to dip my sausage in the egg yolk I don't want to be forced to have my
[9816.70s -> 9822.17s]  sausage in the egg yolk right I want to be able to choose to do that sometimes

[11210.69s -> 11226.94s]  play with no where would you put it that's I think I did I unlock a new
[11226.94s -> 11235.14s]  space like oh yeah right here okay with buildings empty up just I don't want to
[11235.14s -> 11246.24s]  do it make it 10 grand I don't care this is way bigger now okay so what am I
[11246.24s -> 11254.20s]  gonna put in here a dessert thing up the quality on your webcam yeah I don't
[11254.20s -> 11261.36s]  webcams I don't care about see the problem is this thing has this stupid
[11262.20s -> 11269.46s]  auto exposure that even if I turn it I can't is such dog shit they really are
[11269.46s -> 11282.00s]  it's so bad so I can't really mess with the settings on this what do I do this
[11282.00s -> 11294.92s]  well let me try something yeah so I get it does this auto exposure that if I
[11294.92s -> 11303.53s]  turn off auto exposure it goes just dark so this is it without auto exposure on
[11303.53s -> 11311.06s]  I keep in mind I have a I have a ring light glaring into my face right now it
[11311.06s -> 11318.28s]  doesn't make any sense it's doesn't make any sense here's I have a light right
[11318.28s -> 11326.59s]  here I'm gonna turn as bright as that's as bright as this goes and it is it is
[11326.59s -> 11334.68s]  filling this room and burning into my face and if I turn the exposure up just
[11334.68s -> 11343.01s]  a little bit now look at this we're at like 10 FPS right put it down again with
[11343.57s -> 11350.24s]  the ISO changes yeah it's annoying and then when I hit auto exposure here it
[11350.24s -> 11363.01s]  blows me out I don't get it it's annoying that's for sure in the room
[11363.01s -> 11370.10s]  light on it is on you have no idea how I actually bright that really is it hurts
[11370.10s -> 11383.36s]  what is gonna have to be 20 FPS Andy oh also keep in mind I know I'm looking at
[11383.36s -> 11393.67s]  you here was that also keep in mind change the gain yeah if I turn the gain
[11393.67s -> 11398.50s]  down or turn it up it does the same thing it's weird wait let me try that
[11398.50s -> 11404.94s]  and see if I look like an idiot Sunday is green screen movie night part 2
[11404.94s -> 11408.46s]  because it's some fancy but nothing tomorrow but we'll be back on Sunday or
[11408.46s -> 11412.14s]  green screen radio is pure jazz man and that's gonna be a fun one I'm
[11412.14s -> 11417.56s]  predictable and just learn sure you could pay some let me try this tell you
[11417.56s -> 11425.70s]  which buttons to press and so let's turn this on that radio that's that we
[11425.70s -> 11449.66s]  scheduled so then if I turn the gain up here we'll try it that better my semi in
[11449.66s -> 11461.79s]  60 FPS said is that way better contrast is a little too high though isn't it
[11461.79s -> 11480.00s]  how's that I think that's actually better I think we're good now you can see all
[11480.00s -> 11487.80s]  the gross individual hairs on my beard because it's darkening them whatever
[11487.80s -> 11492.96s]  that's what the exposure down to the gain up
[11493.24s -> 11496.96s]  your chicken should not be pink hey we really loved the sponsored content when
[11496.96s -> 11506.80s]  you were fixing your camera and we're having a fucking blast in two-point
[11506.80s -> 11513.37s]  campus I actually this game is really fun I actually like I like to point um
[11513.37s -> 11518.33s]  hospital as well so that's not surprising to me sorry it's not
[11518.33s -> 11524.44s]  surprising to me all right let's upgrade this I can have 15 students now upgrade
[11524.44s -> 11544.61s]  we are not you yep this is a sponsored stream and this stream will be over very

[11609.15s -> 11613.59s]  platforms just because education is a scam doesn't mean all those teachers are

[11618.67s -> 11623.79s]  little volcano it's pretty trippy to learn that volcanoes what's wrong this

[12060.02s -> 12074.08s]  teacher Andy I want let me go to the map I'm curious about something I want to see
[12074.08s -> 12085.89s]  how many zones there are this one's like medieval themed this is the original one
[12085.89s -> 12094.83s]  this is like the one we're on now this one looks like it unlocks maybe this is
[12094.83s -> 12104.79s]  baseball kind of stadium this one over here is there a sandbox mode I'm curious
[12104.83s -> 12115.63s]  did you take a shower there is a sandbox mode oh you have to like beat the game
[12115.63s -> 12126.44s]  okay okay that's cool well you have to get at least through the game this is a
[12126.44s -> 12134.42s]  German stand-in I could see how you feel that way all right let's go back what
[12134.42s -> 12143.94s]  else yeah we'll be like another five minutes you need to do the first four
[12143.94s -> 12152.88s]  levels you're a genuine question how do you manage your pain levels when your
[12152.88s -> 12164.37s]  chronic pain flares up um if I'm really honest distractions help and this is
[12164.37s -> 12170.30s]  kind of one of them whenever I'm just kind of sitting there hanging out and I
[12170.30s -> 12174.62s]  like don't care about that kind of the shitty way that I feel a lot of time
[12174.62s -> 12182.27s]  it's I kind of just put it back here and it's not accessed you probably see from
[12182.27s -> 12188.86s]  time to time I'm you probably pick up on it when I go like this that's me going
[12188.86s -> 12196.35s]  like anytime that you can see the letters down here when I go like that
[12196.55s -> 12204.55s]  it is there it always is and but I just do it and I just try to put it back here
[12204.55s -> 12208.29s]  and just not put it in the front of my head and it's crazy that if you do that
[12208.29s -> 12212.90s]  if you actually try to just distract yourself with stuff you don't focus on
[12212.90s -> 12219.02s]  it and I know that sounds really like yeah man that like it sucks it does but
[12219.02s -> 12224.62s]  I'm right now having fun I'm having fun playing this game hanging out being a
[12224.62s -> 12229.78s]  dickhead on stream so like I don't I don't have time to care about that I
[12229.78s -> 12235.63s]  don't have the capacity to give a shit about that right now right and also go
[12235.63s -> 12240.54s]  to your doctor to pain management's a huge pain in the ass it really is there's
[12240.54s -> 12245.26s]  so many weird dumb things that our body does for no reason that you really
[12245.26s -> 12254.33s]  should have a program with it out with your doctor yeah it's a lot of
[12254.33s -> 12262.36s]  distractions and the more that I have like fun that the more that it does it's
[12262.40s -> 12268.93s]  not a thing that I care about and it sucks it when the stream turns off and
[12268.93s -> 12277.41s]  I'm just kind of lying in bed it's like oh what that's a no excuse me yeah oh
[12277.41s -> 12292.76s]  yeah but that's just that that's just the fact thanks for the cool streams hey
[12292.76s -> 12300.73s]  thanks for being here I'm glad you're here let's have some fun and with that
[12300.73s -> 12306.86s]  I'll see you guys later if streaming helps manage pain why
[12306.90s -> 12311.82s]  well let me make this really clear it's not like the act of streaming that's
[12311.82s -> 12318.50s]  managing my pain symptoms it's just one of a few one of many things that can
[12318.50s -> 12322.06s]  distract me from the current problem make no mistake about it the reason why
[12322.06s -> 12325.02s]  I only stream two three days a week is because it actually does become a
[12325.02s -> 12330.16s]  problem after I sit here for a long time then I'm not hey guys I'm managing my
[12330.16s -> 12340.16s]  pain with twitch streams that's not that's not what I mean yeah that's two
[12340.16s -> 12344.52s]  point campus I give it a stamp of recommendation I know the stream is
[12344.52s -> 12351.66s]  sponsored but I mean it's it it's a fun tongue-in-cheek light-hearted management
[12351.66s -> 12357.38s]  to point kind of tycoon type games it's fun it just is these games are fun there's
[12357.38s -> 12365.48s]  no other way I can spin that for you it's available on you know devs obviously
[12365.48s -> 12372.51s]  I appreciate the sponsor so thank you to two-point campus devs it's a great
[12372.51s -> 12378.32s]  game I think it's really fun I actually think it's a fun game hope you guys
[12378.32s -> 12384.40s]  enjoyed it if you want it if you wanted to you know do your own get on steam
[12384.40s -> 12393.96s]  right now seems like there's a lot of content seems promising is it on switch
[12393.96s -> 12401.53s]  oh yes it is and then a call to the lamb you will see that I will bring call to
[12401.53s -> 12414.84s]  the lamb back after baseball I got a lot of things lined up after baseball yeah
[12414.84s -> 12419.97s]  then that game was really good too two two solid video games back to back today
[12419.97s -> 12424.27s]  yeah that's gonna end the stream that'll end this off with obviously the sponsor
[12424.27s -> 12429.35s]  segment as well go support these devs because you know if they supported the
[12429.35s -> 12435.87s]  channel so that's good special thanks to two-point campus I'll see you guys on
[12435.87s -> 12452.33s]  Sunday it's green screen tomorrow green screen is Sunday Sunday at 4 p.m. Pacific
[12452.33s -> 12469.72s]  Sunday at 4 p.m. Pacific not tomorrow yeah take care everybody see you soon I
[12469.72s -> 12485.54s]  think there are there are more than a hundred green screen videos we're gonna
[12485.54s -> 12491.10s]  be watching I know for a fact that there's at least three to four hours I
[12491.10s -> 12498.14s]  think of content that we have not seen yet so should be exciting stuff I agree
[12498.30s -> 12504.00s]  yeah you should it's I mean in about six hours here you've been potentially
[12504.00s -> 12515.96s]  watching for a long time I would hydrate if you haven't yeah see you on Sunday
[12515.96s -> 12538.40s]  green screen movie night part two have a great night and of course call your
[12538.40s -> 12599.78s]  mother see you guys Sunday
