[3.45s -> 12.68s]  Hey what is happening guys, Jerma here with a gameplay commentary. This is a
[12.68s -> 17.84s]  one-life gameplay with one class. Not with two classes, this is the same class.
[17.84s -> 25.54s]  Two gameplays, one class, one life. In both lives. If that makes absolutely no
[25.54s -> 29.06s]  sense to you, you'll get it in a second. First headshot is on that heavy, this is
[29.06s -> 33.42s]  the Huntsman sniper on Hightower. The first one is gonna be on Hightower. The
[33.42s -> 38.78s]  second one is going to be on Gold Rush, it is, with the default sniper rifle. So
[38.78s -> 43.38s]  two different ends of the spectrum. Huntsman sniper and default sniper, so you
[43.38s -> 47.22s]  get to see both ends of the world. You get to see China and you get to see...
[47.22s -> 52.18s]  what's on the other end of China? America, right? America! You get to see China and
[52.18s -> 57.46s]  America. What a terrible analogy that was. Anyways, payload race Hightower is the
[57.46s -> 61.42s]  map we're playing on right now. And real quickly, I want to give you guys a tip on
[61.42s -> 66.34s]  how to deal with a Huntsman. Never get that close. See how he got right up in my
[66.34s -> 70.58s]  face? When you do that, you are increasing your head's hitbox by a
[70.58s -> 74.86s]  astronomical amount. You never want to get that close to a Huntsman. How to deal
[74.86s -> 79.10s]  with a Huntsman? Stay as far away from them as you can, because you will get
[79.10s -> 83.78s]  luckily headshot in your face. If you get within five to ten feet of a Huntsman,
[83.78s -> 88.26s]  you're pretty much dead. Sneaking around those boxes, luckily get the headshot on
[88.26s -> 91.58s]  that heavy. Good thing, because these dispensers would have gone down, and the
[91.58s -> 94.74s]  engineers, and they would have had to build it all over again, and that just
[94.74s -> 100.06s]  sucks. So I'm glad I could protect those engineers. Long-range headshot on that
[100.06s -> 103.62s]  soldier right there. I love when that happens. There's one thing in this game
[103.62s -> 107.22s]  that I think is the most satisfying thing. It's either an engineer crit from
[107.22s -> 111.58s]  the Frontier Justice, or a long-range across the entire map headshot from the
[111.58s -> 115.26s]  Huntsman. Hands down, I can't think of anything else that's more awesome than
[115.26s -> 119.20s]  that. Trying to time when that scout was going to come out of the door. I didn't
[119.20s -> 122.36s]  time it right, but it's okay. I ended up getting away. He's coming after me guys,
[122.48s -> 127.16s]  and here we go again. The same thing I said before. Watch what happens here. I'm
[127.16s -> 131.28s]  gonna die, right? I get in this little corridor, and look at how close he gets.
[131.28s -> 135.64s]  Now he's dead, and I am completely fine. That could have been the end of my life.
[135.64s -> 140.94s]  Can't stress it enough. Never get close to a Huntsman. Pick off that Pyro right
[140.94s -> 147.22s]  there. A soldier coming around the corner. I miss. He misses. I miss. He misses. This
[147.22s -> 151.06s]  is where it gets a little funny. He gets too close. Get him right in his face, and
[151.06s -> 156.15s]  now it's time for round three with that scout. Dun dun dun dun. Here he is. Jumps
[156.15s -> 160.27s]  over the arrow. Misses me with the ball, and I wonder, you can probably guess on
[160.27s -> 163.83s]  who wins this round. Probably he was getting a little sick of getting shot in
[163.83s -> 167.91s]  the face from two feet away. I think he learned his lesson. Good job scout. You did a
[167.91s -> 172.35s]  fine job. Now before we get on to the next gameplay, I want to show you this. I
[172.35s -> 176.79s]  was pooping my pants because of this by the way. Think I'm gonna headshot him? No. I
[176.79s -> 190.41s]  go for the taunt kill. I get it. I can't believe it. I'm so sad. Oh well, get over it. Time to get
[190.41s -> 194.89s]  on to the next gameplay. This is the default sniper rifle now, and the Darwin's
[194.89s -> 200.29s]  Danger Shield, and the Tribalman Shiv. I do very, very well here. Very, very well.
[200.29s -> 204.25s]  Unfortunately, something else ridiculous happens at the end of this gameplay. Not
[204.25s -> 209.01s]  gonna spoil it, but I wanted to, again, poo my pants and then shoot myself in the
[209.01s -> 213.09s]  face because of what happens. So I saw that spy coming around the corner there.
[213.09s -> 216.57s]  I didn't end up going after him. I really wanted to get the headshot on that pyro,
[216.57s -> 221.61s]  and now me and this huntsman sniper going toe-to-toe. We can't seem to kill
[221.61s -> 227.00s]  either of each other. It's really, really funny, and that's it. Dude, what are you
[227.00s -> 232.48s]  doing spy? Why did you do that? So me and that sniper just say, forget it. I'm not
[232.48s -> 235.36s]  gonna deal with you. You're not gonna deal with me, and we go our separate ways.
[235.36s -> 239.24s]  Headshot on the engineer, and his sentry goes down. Looking good. Sitting pretty.
[239.24s -> 243.56s]  Headshot on that medic, and a headshot on the heavy, but it doesn't kill him. Turn
[243.56s -> 247.04s]  around running away. Don't get yourself killed in these situations. Try to get
[247.04s -> 251.04s]  the upper hand. Try to get the advantage. He sees me again. I turn around. I get the
[251.04s -> 255.78s]  headshot just in time to protect that other sniper. Now I start doing a whole
[255.78s -> 259.42s]  lot of missing in a row. Miss that soldier with the headshot. Miss that
[259.42s -> 262.70s]  engineer with the headshot. Miss his sentry. Doesn't matter. It got destroyed.
[262.70s -> 266.78s]  Anyways, this pyro's doing the smart thing, which is if you didn't know, he
[266.78s -> 270.66s]  stood up. That was the mistake he made. If you don't know, ducking behind the
[270.66s -> 274.74s]  cart is a very, very good way to protect your head of getting headshot, as long as
[274.74s -> 279.60s]  you are right behind it. Specifically the part with the huge bubble, because I can
[279.60s -> 283.80s]  still get you sometimes if you're right behind the cart, right to the side. But
[283.80s -> 287.60s]  he had the right idea. That sniper was coming after me, I could tell, because he
[287.60s -> 292.04s]  was scoped in, looking straight ahead. Get the headshot on him. Get the headshot on
[292.04s -> 295.60s]  that pyro. Bang, bang, bang. We're doing pretty well here. Looking out for that
[295.60s -> 299.68s]  demo spam. Trying to find a situation where I can shoot somebody in their skull
[299.68s -> 304.30s]  cap. A spy tries to backstab me right here. I just barely get out of the way.
[304.30s -> 308.94s]  Now I look in the obvious spy places and that's where he was. Get the kill on him.
[308.94s -> 313.46s]  Coming over here just to resupply my health and my ammo. This is something you
[313.46s -> 317.78s]  never want to let slip your mind, guys, because as a sniper I have 150 health.
[317.78s -> 322.90s]  Usually you have 125 if you're using the, not using the Darwin's Danger Shield. And
[323.22s -> 327.30s]  the big problem is a lot of people forget about going to resupply their health and
[327.30s -> 331.26s]  you can get killed by a sniper that's counter sniping you in potentially one
[331.26s -> 335.30s]  body shot. So you always want to make sure that you have full health, or at
[335.30s -> 339.98s]  least very close to full health, anytime you are sniping. Otherwise, like I said,
[339.98s -> 343.46s]  you could potentially just get one shot by some dude that just goes counter
[343.46s -> 348.30s]  sniper and just murders you. Not having very much luck with the front end of the
[348.30s -> 352.14s]  gate here, so I turn around and go to the right side. Ends up being a good idea
[352.14s -> 356.46s]  because I end up getting three or four headshots in a row. There's one. Here
[356.46s -> 359.34s]  comes two on this heavy. Doesn't kill him, but it's okay. Watch what he does.
[359.34s -> 364.02s]  He's like, no! He jumps in the air trying to avoid me. I get it. Soldier coming
[364.02s -> 367.30s]  around here. I get the headshot on him as well, which makes it three headshot
[367.30s -> 372.02s]  kills in a row. Just briefly now I want to talk about one thing really quickly
[372.02s -> 375.10s]  before the end of the gameplay. Coming up to a close here in the next minute or
[375.10s -> 379.14s]  so, I just want to let you guys know how to play with sniper. If you guys go back
[379.18s -> 383.66s]  a couple of months, go back to my Uber update video. If you watch my Uber update
[383.66s -> 389.82s]  video, you will see I was an atrocious sniper. I said in that gameplay, I'm a
[389.82s -> 393.46s]  terrible sniper. I'll never be good at sniper. I'm awful. And I kind of swore
[393.46s -> 398.70s]  off the class for a while. Just recently, the last maybe month or so, I started to
[398.70s -> 403.22s]  really practice sniper and get much better at it. And that's really what it
[403.22s -> 407.38s]  takes, guys. It's all about the muscle memory. It's all about keeping your arm
[407.42s -> 411.98s]  and wrist in check and not flying all over the place just relaxing. Go to a
[411.98s -> 416.74s]  couple of orange maps or go to a sniper specific map. You will get better. You
[416.74s -> 420.66s]  just have to practice. It takes a little bit of time, takes some effort. That's
[420.66s -> 424.18s]  all I have to say about that. The gameplay is coming to a close here in the
[424.18s -> 428.22s]  next 30 seconds, but the most important part of this gameplay is coming up right
[428.22s -> 432.22s]  now in the next 15 seconds. Get ready for this so you see the spy right here,
[432.22s -> 436.70s]  right? Okay, I'm aware of him. I know he's there. So I come back around here
[436.70s -> 440.78s]  going up to the top of this corridor up here, and I figure if he's going to come
[440.78s -> 444.70s]  up there, I'll see him and I'll probably bump into him. There he is.
[452.59s -> 457.91s]  Oh my God. Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. I
[457.91s -> 459.87s]  will see you all next time. Take care.
