[4.86s -> 18.54s]  Hello. Hello. How are you? That's good. That's good. Good. I'm good.
[20.70s -> 31.72s]  709. You're late. It's 409, actually, in my part of the world. Also, I- you guys didn't turn your
[31.72s -> 38.42s]  clocks back? The second- we have a few daylight savings times. You have to go back- you fall
[38.42s -> 46.55s]  back 10 minutes. You guys didn't do that? Don't be- I- you didn't do that? I didn't? What are
[46.55s -> 55.02s]  you talking about? Yeah, it's fall back. No, that's not- sorry, it's- it's uh- it's simmer down.
[55.82s -> 70.42s]  Summer, like simmer down, right? By 10 minutes. Summer down. Yeah, the summer simmer down.
[72.84s -> 85.45s]  That's not funny. You need to be funny. I got a whole book of jokes, okay? The joke- I have a
[85.45s -> 91.42s]  joke book. No, you're not gonna find every- all right, you're not gonna find every single thing
[91.42s -> 97.42s]  I say funny. If you did, if you- okay, if you thought every single thing I said was funny,
[97.42s -> 105.42s]  I would feel like you would just blow and smoke up my ass. You know what I mean? You're not gonna
[105.42s -> 109.90s]  think everything I say is funny. Otherwise, you'd- you might just be blowing smoke up my ass.
[116.60s -> 128.50s]  I have to tell you guys something. Um, I had an insane dream. Wild. This- this was wild. It was an
[128.50s -> 138.82s]  entire television show. It was a whole movie. It was fucked up. I- I'll tell- I'm gonna tell the
[138.82s -> 143.32s]  whole thing- I gotta try to remember it, though, because the thing about dreams is it- I wrote
[143.32s -> 154.82s]  the whole thing down. It's about, I don't know, I said like a full page long. And this one- I- you
[154.82s -> 158.98s]  guys are gonna think this one's funny because it has a really- it has a really interesting ending.
[160.58s -> 168.09s]  I will be- I'm gonna give you a warning here. It's disgusting. It's gross. It's really gross.
[174.14s -> 178.14s]  But I'm- I'll tell- I want to wait till more people- do I want to wait till more people are here to-
[178.14s -> 183.02s]  so more people hear this? Or do I want less people to hear this? So it doesn't- you know,
[183.02s -> 187.82s]  people don't think I'm weird. You know what I mean? Should I wait for more people or less people?
[187.82s -> 199.77s]  But then I feel like- I'll tell it in a second. Let me explain what we're doing. Let me give you
[199.77s -> 205.90s]  the kind of lowdown of what's going on today. We're gonna play a game today called Later Alligator.
[207.98s -> 215.14s]  Excuse me, Later Alligator. This is a kind of a puzzle slash point and click adventure game
[215.14s -> 220.50s]  with really cute interesting characters, I guess. It seems like- I mean, people have been requesting
[220.50s -> 225.34s]  this for a while. It's been requested for like a year. It's supposed to be really fun, just like
[225.34s -> 234.60s]  a chill game. We're gonna play it. If I get kind of over it and I'm done with it, I'm gonna play
[234.60s -> 245.16s]  a game called Webbed. We're probably still gonna play Webbed. Webbed is apparently really fun.
[245.72s -> 251.35s]  It's time for you to do a lot of voices. I think- isn't the- it seems like it's voice acted.
[251.99s -> 262.47s]  Is the whole game voice acted? I thought so. What is better, alligator or crocodile? It's
[262.47s -> 270.22s]  a different animal. Stop doing that. Stop doing that. Ow, my hand. Look what happened.
[271.42s -> 280.81s]  I just hit my desk hard. What the fuck? We're gonna have 15 different Bernie Sanders voices today.
[281.45s -> 290.20s]  I don't know, are we? Is somebody gonna talk like this? Is there gonna be another character that
[290.20s -> 304.90s]  talks like this? Yeah, probably will be a few. Do you want a barf drink or statue?
[305.70s -> 316.23s]  No, but I mean maybe. That sounds like kind of cool, maybe. Do you want one of those?
[318.14s -> 331.56s]  Do you like axolotls? Yeah, they're really cute. Please explain the birds and the bees. I'm really
[331.56s -> 339.53s]  confused by it. They're two animals. One of them's an insect. The other one's a bird that flies around.
[340.25s -> 348.20s]  The bees are literally gonna- that's how humanity ends, okay? The bees- you want to look into the
[348.20s -> 352.68s]  bees? Have we have issues here with the bees? That's how humanity ends. There's your birds
[352.68s -> 363.69s]  and the bees. Once the bees are gone, we're all dead. Don't you get it? When the bees are gone,
[363.69s -> 384.01s]  we are all dead. Wise words. Save the bees. What about the mosquitoes? Fuck the mosquitoes.
[388.62s -> 392.38s]  Insect-tier list. Okay, do you guys want to hear a tidbit of information here?
[393.99s -> 397.59s]  Uh, mosquitoes are all the way below F-tier. They're the worst insect.
[399.27s -> 406.10s]  Mosquitoes were part of the reason why I moved to Nevada. I was like, what's a part of the world
[406.10s -> 411.78s]  where I will never see one of those motherfucking mosquitoes ever again? Ever. I don't even- I
[411.78s -> 417.67s]  don't want to see them ever again. Nevada is one of those places where there just are no mosquitoes.
[417.67s -> 427.03s]  They do not exist. I would rather get stung in the mouth by a scorpion than be outside,
[427.67s -> 437.05s]  ever again, at like 6 30 p.m. in Massachusetts and look up and see the swarm of these bugs that just
[437.05s -> 446.73s]  want to suck all your blood out. That's kind of extreme. It is. I hate mosquitoes. Having to be
[446.73s -> 452.71s]  out there and to- look, look, let me show you. When you are outside and there's a place where
[452.71s -> 458.55s]  there's a lot of mosquitoes but a really humid place. Does this remind you? Does this- are you
[458.55s -> 469.27s]  aware of this scenario? Yeah, so how's school? Yeah, no, it's cool. I think one of the big
[469.27s -> 479.00s]  problems I think with the school system- you just graduated? Yeah. Yep. I don't like doing that. I
[479.00s -> 487.00s]  don't like fucking doing that. I'm so glad I never have to do that again. And everybody is doing it.
[487.00s -> 493.21s]  Everybody in like the group of people outside are all doing it. It's not abnormal to see somebody
[493.21s -> 501.03s]  just freak out and like reach elastic style around their back and be like, yeah, what time do you
[501.03s -> 507.83s]  guys want to go? If we want to get coffee, we probably should go at like six, maybe, maybe,
[507.83s -> 514.50s]  maybe seven. It's like this is normal. I don't- I hate it. You're a hater. Yeah, I am a- I'm a
[514.50s -> 532.04s]  mosquito hater. That was based. Okay, take a look at this. Ah, this is later alligator.
[532.68s -> 542.71s]  Do I talk about my dream now? Okay, this dream is fucking crazy. All right, let's- let me start.
[542.71s -> 550.54s]  Hold on. So I had a dream. I would tell you right now this is disgusting. This is a very gross
[551.10s -> 556.46s]  thing that happened. Your sideburns aren't even. I need a haircut. Sometimes when I shave,
[556.46s -> 563.29s]  I don't- I like- I fuck it up, all right? All right, this is actually a lot. That's really bad
[563.29s -> 568.81s]  now that I look at it. That's like- that's pretty awful. It's like so full. I don't- but listen,
[569.13s -> 575.62s]  I think it's- I think it's because I like went to- my hair has a weird growing pattern.
[576.26s -> 582.79s]  Is it that bad? All right, it is bad. But listen, my hair is a lot thinner here than it- look at
[582.79s -> 589.83s]  how much thicker my hair is here. You see? It's really- I have really thick hair here and really
[589.83s -> 596.97s]  thin hair here. I didn't shave this. Look, see? It's- see how it's better now? Because like this
[596.97s -> 603.22s]  kind of- it thins out. You're reusing the sideburns bit. No, I just don't care when I shave.
[604.52s -> 610.20s]  I- when I go and get my haircut, they get it to where it needs to be. I just don't care. I
[610.20s -> 615.78s]  shave my face and I go, whatever, that's close enough. Whatever, that's close enough. I just
[615.78s -> 620.82s]  don't care. I don't care. Like this is fine, right? When I go get a haircut, they take care of that.
[622.25s -> 628.09s]  I don't care. I do the same thing. I can't be bothered. See? Some of you get it. I know you do.
[630.33s -> 638.74s]  Okay, so listen. It sticks out. It's because I haven't had a haircut. They go
[641.30s -> 647.70s]  and they get rid of it. This is not worst hair. Stop that worst hair. I didn't do anything.
[648.71s -> 654.47s]  What the fuck are you talking about? My hair looks fine. My hair looks like good. Look at this. It's
[654.47s -> 660.71s]  like smooth. It's silky. It's been conditioned. Just because I have sideburn hair does not make
[660.71s -> 664.71s]  it worst hair. I'm not even putting it on a- I'm not even making it a category this year. Good luck.
[665.72s -> 670.44s]  It looks greasy. It's- what do you mean greasy? It's- look at that. Could greasy hair do this?
[674.36s -> 717.67s]  Nope. It's not- how is it worst hair? You guys are fucked. Whatever. So I had this dream. I had a
[717.67s -> 727.91s]  dream where I was- hold on. So I had this dream. This dream is crazy. I want to- I have to warn
[727.91s -> 733.38s]  everybody here, seriously. I'm going to probably, like, this is going to gross people out. I had
[733.38s -> 743.18s]  this dream. Why is my mic peaking? It's not. Fix your settings. Fix your settings. There's nothing
[743.18s -> 755.72s]  wrong with my mic. Okay. So there's enough people here. Whatever. Is stalling? This is- what do you
[755.72s -> 768.81s]  mean stalling? You just did stun locks. Fine. Okay. So here- listen to me. This is really important.
[768.81s -> 779.74s]  I had this dream where me and Holly were on a road trip. This is like two different dreams that were
[779.74s -> 785.03s]  connected for no reason. So me and Holly were on a road trip. We were, like, driving somewhere.
[785.90s -> 794.94s]  And, you know, in dreams, stuff just gets kind of stitched together and you don't really know why.
[794.94s -> 803.77s]  Holly and I- fix your settings! I don't care. So Holly and I, we went on a road trip and we stopped
[803.77s -> 811.05s]  at, like, a gas station slash, um, a gas station slash- I can hear her laughing already. I already
[811.05s -> 817.13s]  told her this, by the way. And she was disgusted, by the way. She was like, this is- this story is
[817.13s -> 824.49s]  fucking disgusting. Like, I- she- I- she's heard the story already. So anyways, uh, we go to gas
[824.49s -> 831.98s]  station and we pull in and it's a car wash slash gas station. Okay, cool. So the idea was, okay,
[831.98s -> 835.02s]  we're gonna get out and, like, and they're gonna wash the car and whatever. I don't know why we
[835.02s -> 839.82s]  decided to go get a car wash, um, in the middle of a road trip to some friend's house or something.
[840.54s -> 844.86s]  So we get out of the car and it's like, okay, take the car. Sure, whatever. Go ahead, go for it.
[844.86s -> 850.54s]  Take it and wash it. And one of the workers- this guy had, like, a clipboard here. And I, like, went
[850.54s -> 856.14s]  to go do something and Holly was, like, in the- kind of in the business or whatever. And this guy- I
[856.14s -> 861.34s]  don't know if he was, like, going to attack Holly. Like, I don't know why the employee was doing this.
[861.34s -> 866.22s]  Like, I come back out- I think it was, like, maybe I was outside for some reason. I come back in the
[866.22s -> 872.73s]  establishment and this guy's, like, going to, like, attack Holly. So I, like, got in the way
[872.73s -> 877.05s]  and I, like, fucking pushed the guy and he pushed me back and I, like, shoved him with the clipboard
[877.05s -> 881.38s]  and this clipboard, like, hit him in the face and I started fighting this fucking guy. I was, like,
[881.38s -> 886.02s]  fucking punching him in the face and we were fighting, just fighting each other. And the whole
[886.02s -> 893.91s]  time we're- this car is at the car wash, right? So, okay, what- the car is, like, at the car wash.
[894.71s -> 898.23s]  Splash! We're gone. We're not in the car wash anymore. We're outside the car wash.
[898.23s -> 903.69s]  I don't know how it's stitched together. And we're looking for the car. And the whole time,
[903.69s -> 907.21s]  like, Holly and I are like, that guy was- what the fuck was that guy's problem? That guy was a piece
[907.21s -> 911.37s]  of shit. Yeah, I, like, kicked his ass. Like, I fucking beat him up. Whatever, right? So I
[911.37s -> 915.37s]  kicked this guy's ass. And we're looking around for the car. We can't find it. We don't know where it
[915.37s -> 920.73s]  is. Um, eventually we come to the termination after walking around the parking lot four or
[920.73s -> 929.11s]  five different times. The car is gone. The car's gone. Somebody stole the car, okay? Somebody
[929.11s -> 936.95s]  stole the car. It's just not there anymore. So we had to start walking to my friend's house,
[936.95s -> 945.37s]  whatever it was, we started walking. Who's Holly? Holly's my girlfriend. So we- we had to walk. As
[945.37s -> 952.33s]  we're walking down the sidewalk, whatever, some guy in, like, a trench coat and these, like, big,
[952.33s -> 957.29s]  like, sunglasses. He was wearing these huge sunglasses. Comes up to us. He's, like, walking
[957.29s -> 961.05s]  kind of next to us and we're like, what the fuck is going on? And this guy walks up to us and he
[961.05s -> 968.54s]  goes, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, spray me in the face with this. And he hands Holly this, like, aerosol
[968.54s -> 976.33s]  can to spray him in the face. So we're just like, I don't- I- oh, I mean, you're gonna leave us alone?
[976.33s -> 982.33s]  Just leave us alone. So the guy- the guy's sitting there just waiting for Holly to spray him in the
[982.33s -> 988.25s]  face. So she holds the nozzle up like this and is, like, pointing at him and she goes
[989.85s -> 994.49s]  and sprays herself. It was- the guy was- it was a prank. The guy turned the nozzle the other way
[994.49s -> 1001.58s]  and she maced herself in the face and she's, like, and I'm, like, what the fuck just happened?
[1001.58s -> 1005.26s]  What the fuck? And the guy starts laughing. So I start fighting the guy. I, like, start- I'm,
[1005.26s -> 1009.18s]  like, fucking- I fight this guy. I start punching this guy. I'm fighting this guy.
[1009.18s -> 1013.94s]  Like, I used to fight another person. I'm fighting another guy. Holly's over, like,
[1013.94s -> 1017.70s]  on the sidewalk with, like, these, like, welling up in her eyes. Like, I was like, I don't know
[1017.70s -> 1022.58s]  what the fuck it was. So I'm fighting this guy and we get to a point where, like, we're wrestling
[1022.58s -> 1027.06s]  around, like, fighting each other and there was a side- like, a drop down. We were on, like,
[1027.06s -> 1032.34s]  a sidewalk and there was a lip and then another sidewalk. Maybe, like, I don't know, maybe five
[1032.34s -> 1041.38s]  feet, six feet lower. This guy jumps down to, like, get down to the other sidewalk and I'm looking
[1041.38s -> 1045.38s]  down at him. He's only, like, remember, he's only, like, five or six feet below me and I'm, like,
[1046.26s -> 1051.78s]  I'm gonna- fuck this. I know what to do. So I, like, falling R1 the guy. Like, that was gonna work
[1051.78s -> 1058.18s]  in real life. So I, like, fall and, like, punch and I, like, punch him in the head and, like,
[1058.26s -> 1063.30s]  I fucking get him. Like, I knock this dude out. Two of his friends are, like, coming over and I'm,
[1063.30s -> 1068.74s]  like, oh shit, this is bad. This is really bad and they're, like, oh yeah, fuck him. He's a fucking
[1068.74s -> 1074.50s]  asshole, man. I'm just, like, what? Like, all right. Flash again. This is where it gets weird. This is
[1074.50s -> 1079.03s]  where it gets really weird and I'm gonna warn everybody. This is where it gets gross. We are
[1079.03s -> 1085.19s]  at our destination, right, after that happened. We get to the destination. We're at my friend's house
[1086.49s -> 1090.65s]  and I really have to go to the bathroom. Like, I could have been at that. Remember, this is a
[1090.65s -> 1096.57s]  gross story. Number two. So the bathroom is, like, I remember, like, this is stitched together in such
[1096.57s -> 1102.26s]  a weird way. I don't know how it's stitched together. So we get there. I go to their bathroom
[1103.16s -> 1111.74s]  and their bathroom is a bedroom. It's like a bedroom. There's a toilet that's, like, five feet
[1111.74s -> 1117.50s]  tall. The bowl is, like, up here and it's, like, a bunch of porcelain going all the way down,
[1118.14s -> 1123.88s]  okay? So, all right, it's, like, this is, like, this is, why is your bathroom a fucking bedroom?
[1123.88s -> 1131.06s]  There's, like, a shelving thing over here. There's, like, a bed over there, too, and it's just,
[1131.06s -> 1138.10s]  like, weird, like, why is it like this? So, again, this is gross. So I get, like, up on this huge,
[1138.10s -> 1142.74s]  like, high, it's, like, it was, like, a gigantic, like, high chair. It was, like, a big high,
[1142.74s -> 1146.66s]  that's all the way I can describe it. It was huge. Like, it was really high off the ground for no
[1146.66s -> 1155.14s]  reason. So I get over there, dude, I, this is gross. I take a huge shit, right? I take a
[1156.50s -> 1164.34s]  massive shit in this toilet and I'm done. Okay, that's it. I'm done. It's time now. It is time.
[1164.34s -> 1168.58s]  I told you this was going to be gross. I warned you, like, five times. So, like, I flushed the
[1168.58s -> 1175.00s]  toilet, whatever, and everything's fine, and I'm like, okay, it's time to, it's time to clean up,
[1175.00s -> 1178.76s]  right? So I look over at the material that you used to clean up, which is the toilet paper,
[1179.56s -> 1185.88s]  and there on this roll next to here was, like, right next to the toilet. The toilet paper roll
[1185.88s -> 1193.35s]  had this stain on it. It was a stain. You know what I mean? And I was just, like, I don't, uh-uh-uh,
[1193.35s -> 1198.95s]  I don't think so. So I kind of rolled it a little bit and the stain was there still,
[1198.95s -> 1202.87s]  a little bit faded, still there, a little bit faded, still. I'm like, I don't want to use this.
[1202.87s -> 1211.11s]  I'm not using this. So I'm like, what the fuck do I do now? Oh, I know. There, over on the shelf,
[1211.67s -> 1219.05s]  on the shelf in this bedroom bathroom was, like, of various sizes and shapes, different toilet paper
[1219.05s -> 1223.85s]  rolls. Like, some of them were kind of halfway undone. Some of them were wrapped up in, like,
[1223.85s -> 1230.65s]  the hotel wrapping. So I'm like, all right, the hotel wrapping over there. I, I, that's,
[1230.65s -> 1234.49s]  that's the one. It's a fresh one. It's brand new, right? It's wrapped in, like, that, that hotel
[1234.49s -> 1242.07s]  wrapping. So I go, I, I, I start to go up to go to where the toilet paper is. But remember,
[1242.07s -> 1245.51s]  I don't know why dreams are like this. Don't ask me why. Please don't ask me why. I don't,
[1245.51s -> 1253.38s]  I can't describe why this happens. I was in the water, up to here, like, like a fucking jacuzzi.
[1254.47s -> 1260.31s]  And I was, like, pushing up to get out of, like, the jacuzzi and, like, get, making it so my elbows
[1260.31s -> 1266.47s]  were, like, on the bowl and, like, getting up because that's how I had to get out. So I finally
[1266.47s -> 1272.79s]  get up, I'm soaking wet and I'm, like, out of the toilet and I go over to grab this, like, I'm like,
[1272.79s -> 1277.75s]  what the fuck am I gonna do? So I grab this, this wrapped toilet paper, fresh toilet paper roll.
[1277.75s -> 1282.79s]  Okay. I didn't fall in. I was apparently already in it. Dreams don't make any sense. I was
[1282.79s -> 1288.15s]  apparently already in this toilet and, like, up to here. Remember, this thing was, like, five feet
[1288.15s -> 1295.85s]  tall. So I, I get out, I unwrap the new toilet paper and there's a fucking huge stain on it.
[1295.85s -> 1301.13s]  It's a huge stain. Again, I was like, this doesn't make any sense. Something with the manufacturing
[1301.13s -> 1305.85s]  this shit. What happened? This doesn't make any sense. Why is it like this? I don't get it. What
[1305.85s -> 1313.13s]  the fuck? So I can't use this roll either. So I put that down. I, I go over the, again, there are
[1313.13s -> 1318.41s]  tons of, there's, like, five different rolls on a shelf over here and I grab one of them. That's,
[1318.41s -> 1324.78s]  like, kind of halfway done. But this toilet paper roll was, like, antique. It was falling apart in
[1324.78s -> 1329.58s]  my hands. Like, I would unroll it and it was, like, crumbling out, like, like, as if it was, like,
[1329.58s -> 1337.43s]  antique. I was like, I can't fucking use this either. What the hell is going on? So eventually,
[1338.07s -> 1344.52s]  eventually, I get to a roll that I have in my hand and I'm like, this looks pretty good.
[1344.52s -> 1348.20s]  There's nothing on it. There's no stains on it. It's not, like, weird crumbling in my hands,
[1348.20s -> 1353.26s]  antique bullshit. I start to, like, get it over to where, remember, I just crawled out of the toilet.
[1353.26s -> 1359.74s]  I get over to where the toilet is and, like, it's kind of, like, oddly heavy. So I, the toilet paper
[1359.74s -> 1364.46s]  roll kind of unrolls a little bit and then it unravels and hits the ground and starts rolling
[1364.46s -> 1372.87s]  on the ground. And there is rolled up in the toilet paper, like, 30 to 40 thousand fucking
[1372.87s -> 1378.55s]  dollars. It was where this person was, like, hiding money in their house. It was, like,
[1378.55s -> 1384.55s]  they were hiding money here, hiding it. I was like, oh my god, no, what the fuck? There was,
[1384.55s -> 1389.99s]  like, a hidden money spot in your house? What the fuck? So I try to, and then this is all this money.
[1389.99s -> 1393.91s]  There was, like, other, like, little antique shit in here, right? There was, like, little antiques
[1393.91s -> 1397.27s]  in it. There were, like, little trinkets, like, wrapped up in the money that was wrapped in the
[1397.27s -> 1403.51s]  toilet paper. So I start picking up these, like, this bundle of, like, just, like, it's rolled up
[1403.51s -> 1408.15s]  money. It was, like, rolled like this. And I don't know what to do with it because no matter what I
[1408.15s -> 1413.75s]  did, this was going to, I would never make it look the same way, right? Like, holy shit, man, this
[1413.75s -> 1417.99s]  was wrapped up so perfectly. It's going to be a mess. They're going to know that I did that,
[1417.99s -> 1423.77s]  right? They're going to know that something happened. So this is one. This dream is your
[1423.77s -> 1430.25s]  internal struggle with money and greed. Well, I'm not done. It gets worse. So eventually,
[1430.25s -> 1434.97s]  like, this unwrapped money, I, like, put it back on the shelf. It's all fucking crumpled up and
[1434.97s -> 1438.81s]  all fucked up looking. So there's no way I did, there's no way I didn't touch it, okay?
[1440.12s -> 1446.78s]  Finally, I get a piece of toilet paper, like, a roll that is fine and it works. I bring it over
[1447.58s -> 1456.34s]  and I realize that there's a gigantic window directly across from the fucking toilet,
[1456.34s -> 1463.78s]  like a huge bay window. And I was like, whoa, what the fuck? Somebody could have seen this.
[1463.78s -> 1468.02s]  What the, somebody could see me walking around like this. And like, who's, could anybody see,
[1468.02s -> 1470.90s]  why would you have a window like this? Why would you have a huge bay window here? What the fuck is
[1470.90s -> 1476.02s]  wrong with you? What are you, what's fucking wrong with you? So boom, I wake up. I wake up
[1476.02s -> 1483.56s]  and I'm lying in bed and I open my eyes and after this insane dream, I thought I shit my pants.
[1483.56s -> 1487.56s]  I thought there was shit in my, in my, like, asshole in my ass cheeks. So I'm sitting there
[1487.56s -> 1493.56s]  going, I shit my pants. Like, there's shit in my ass. So this is real life. Like, I'm lying there
[1493.56s -> 1499.00s]  in real life going like, yup, yeah, this, I, there's, I shit, there's shit here. I felt it.
[1499.00s -> 1505.48s]  I knew it. I was certain about it. So I get out of bed and I, like, waddle over, like, slowly.
[1505.72s -> 1511.35s]  This is the slowest I've ever gotten out of bed. And I walk over towards the bathroom and I go,
[1511.35s -> 1518.90s]  and I, like, go to get the toilet paper. And guess what? There ain't no toilet paper in there.
[1520.30s -> 1527.58s]  So, so I waddle across the fucking house, just like, god damn it, no, it can't be real.
[1527.58s -> 1533.02s]  And I waddle across the fucking house and I get, go to where the toilet paper is. And I get into,
[1533.02s -> 1537.58s]  I get into a private place and I, like, do what I need to do and I wipe my ass
[1538.14s -> 1546.55s]  and it's clean. There's nothing there. There's absolutely nothing there. It was fucking nothing
[1546.55s -> 1551.58s]  happened. And this probably, I probably, I probably, like, slowly walked around the house like I had
[1551.58s -> 1555.82s]  shit in my pants for, like, probably five minutes. Maybe, like, two, you know what, no, that's a lie.
[1556.70s -> 1564.50s]  Maybe, like, two or three minutes total. But still, that's, like, so long. And then I left and I was
[1564.50s -> 1571.61s]  like, well, that was fucking wild. And I had a wicked bad headache. I had a wicked bad headache
[1571.61s -> 1575.83s]  and I kind of still do. I don't know, man, like, I just have these dreams that just become so
[1575.83s -> 1584.20s]  fucking strange. And that was it. And I was like, oh, that was, like, ridiculous. And I wrote this
[1584.20s -> 1591.67s]  all down too. I remember, Holly was, like, out here, like, in her office working. And I was just,
[1591.67s -> 1596.95s]  like, it was, like, wicked early in the morning. Like, she was up working. And I was just, like,
[1597.75s -> 1603.13s]  I, like, walked kind of by her and I was like, hey, hi. Like, I probably looked wicked fucked up.
[1603.45s -> 1612.58s]  And she can literally attest to this. Like, this, this is real. I was, like, slowly walking by,
[1612.58s -> 1619.14s]  just like, hey, hey, yeah, I'm just, like, getting up. It was fucking wild. And I had to write this
[1619.14s -> 1629.16s]  whole thing down. I thought I should, I thought I should the bed. Because I thought, like, oh,
[1629.16s -> 1633.88s]  my God. Okay, I got to be careful because I don't, I, like, in my brain, I was going over every
[1633.88s -> 1640.42s]  single scenario, like, I hope don't come in, don't, do not come into the bedroom. Do not go in the
[1640.50s -> 1645.32s]  bedroom. Because, like, I may have shit the bed. Like, but how do you say that to somebody? Oh,
[1645.32s -> 1650.28s]  hey, um, hey, I just, like, woke up and I'm in, like, kind of a daze. But I may, I may have shit
[1650.28s -> 1660.97s]  the bed. Don't go in there. Somebody said TMI. I told you, I warned you over and over again.
[1660.97s -> 1665.69s]  This is a gross story. This is not, this didn't happen. This is not a real story. Let me be,
[1665.69s -> 1674.50s]  look, that didn't happen. This was in the dream. Oh, this music. This music should not have been
[1674.50s -> 1683.54s]  on this whole time. But I don't, okay, I don't know what it is about why our brains do this weird
[1683.54s -> 1693.18s]  shit to us. But when I woke up from that dream, I, I shit my pants. Like, I did. I felt it. You
[1693.18s -> 1699.46s]  know what I mean? Like, it was like, oh, no, no, no, this is bad. This really happened. I really
[1699.46s -> 1706.52s]  thought it happened. I actually really did. But why? Why does my brain want to do that? Why does
[1706.52s -> 1711.56s]  my brain feel like, oh, hey, by the way, I need to tell you something. Like, you really did that.
[1711.56s -> 1715.24s]  But like the first minute that you're up, I'm sitting there, I was lying on my back.
[1715.24s -> 1723.78s]  I'm lying on my back just going, oh, no, oh, no, this is not good. What do I do about this?
[1723.78s -> 1728.76s]  What am I supposed to do about this? It was like so much internal panic, like through that entire,
[1728.76s -> 1735.48s]  like I, I don't know, I fought like two or three people. I thought I shit my pants. You
[1735.48s -> 1745.16s]  just stopped doing DMT. I don't, I don't do anything. Anyways, we're going to play Later
[1745.16s -> 1757.80s]  Alligator. And the fact that I was in the toilet, why was I in the water? OK, I know that like the
[1757.80s -> 1761.32s]  people have like dream journals and people are like, oh, this is why you had that dream. I don't,
[1761.32s -> 1765.56s]  OK, if I told like somebody that was like a dream journal specialist or whatever that dream,
[1766.52s -> 1769.88s]  they probably would be like, you made that up. Like that's, that doesn't happen. I don't know
[1769.88s -> 1777.53s]  what the fuck is wrong with you. I have no idea what's wrong with you. This game is, OK, here we go.
[1780.90s -> 1793.45s]  Release the Armin Audition tape. That's what Holly just said. I'm not doing that. Not right now.
[1793.45s -> 1805.37s]  I'll do that before I like, I retire. And remember, this is important too. I know that like,
[1805.37s -> 1808.65s]  sure, me and Holly have a great relationship, right? And like, it's, it's very wonderful.
[1808.65s -> 1815.96s]  I like, it's a great relationship. It's fantastic. But like, it, I, I don't want to, I still like,
[1815.96s -> 1822.04s]  don't want to like fart like loud in front of her. So the prospect of, I may have shit the bed,
[1822.04s -> 1828.57s]  honey. It's like, whoa, you went from like, you are farting in front of your girlfriend to
[1828.57s -> 1834.89s]  you shit the bed. That's too hot. That's way too much. That's too fast. I'm gonna slow that down,
[1834.89s -> 1840.65s]  right? You're gonna slow way that, slow way down. What's an alligator? It's a dinosaur that made it
[1840.65s -> 1854.66s]  through the meteor, OK? Here we go. You guys ready? So this is Later Alligator. It's a puzzle game
[1854.66s -> 1865.67s]  and we're gonna have a great time playing. You and I. No company, please, thank you. OK? Latte
[1865.67s -> 1875.53s]  machine. Two earbuds? I thought about it. No, um, no ablo ingles, no ablo espanol, no ablos at all.
[1875.53s -> 1888.33s]  Not even one ablo. What's going on here? 48 puzzles! Do I have a knife? There's no voice acting? I
[1888.33s -> 1894.76s]  think there is. They said there's a voice volume indicator. Hey, I'm trying to lay low here, so
[1894.76s -> 1902.38s]  maybe can you move on, please? OK? OK? You got me. I'll come clean. Sorry for being so rude before.
[1902.38s -> 1905.82s]  I am just a little, well, I'm turning the cam off for this. I'm just a little on edge.
[1906.63s -> 1911.11s]  Normally I wouldn't tell anyone this, but you've got such soulful eyes that I can totally see the
[1911.83s -> 1918.52s]  eternity of. So I feel safe with you, stranger. You see, usually I love coming to John Johnny's
[1918.52s -> 1924.78s]  on my birthday like this. Staying in the hotel, floating in the pool, eating two bagels at the
[1924.78s -> 1929.34s]  Continental Breakfast, eating two soaps in the complimentary bath basket. Ooh. Why did I say
[1929.34s -> 1937.29s]  ooh? Ugh. I just burped. But this year I've got a problem. A real problem. A real, real, big,
[1938.01s -> 1942.49s]  problem. The thing is, I'm pretty sure the family is finally trying to rub me out for squealing.
[1943.13s -> 1947.43s]  I didn't mean to squeal, honest. I just see a pair of earnest eyes and the secrets just start
[1947.43s -> 1955.53s]  flowing out of my snoot. See? I'm doing it right now. Oh, cheese and crackers. What am I going to
[1955.53s -> 1961.08s]  do? I don't want to be rubbed out. Two Tantona even told me I have to meet him upstairs here at
[1961.08s -> 1966.89s]  H Sharp for the event. They think I don't know, but I heard him talking to Big Mama on the phone.
[1967.53s -> 1971.85s]  Well, family's going to come to really show me how it's done. What am I going to do? I don't want
[1971.85s -> 1975.69s]  to sleep with the fishes. I have shell physiology and I have my asthma accent when I get too
[1975.69s -> 1980.73s]  waterlogged. Wait a second. You're interested in me, right? You wanted to sit with me for
[1980.73s -> 1986.07s]  breakfast and everything. Do you think that you could help me? Since we're such great pals,
[1986.07s -> 1991.37s]  you could go out and talk to my family around Alligator, New York City. Find out information
[1991.37s -> 1996.17s]  about the event and report back to me. Yes, that's a great idea. Together, maybe we can collect
[1996.17s -> 2003.43s]  enough info to save me. You want to save me, right? Right? Great. I'll text you if I need
[2003.43s -> 2012.50s]  any help. How about you go there and start? Do you have a watch? Oh, you do? Great. I'll text a
[2012.50s -> 2017.62s]  little before 10 a.m. since it can take 15 minutes or so to get back here on the trolley. Make sure
[2017.62s -> 2022.42s]  you check your watch a bunch. If you happen to get stuck doing some weird game-like activities
[2022.42s -> 2027.62s]  while investigating, it could take time. I don't have because I'm going to have to, I'm going to
[2027.62s -> 2033.74s]  have to, I'm going to have a murder done on me. I'm okay. Think of the beach, Pat. Remember what
[2033.74s -> 2039.38s]  Dr. Duples knew to you. Anyways, thank you for helping me out like an alligator might be. I feel
[2039.38s -> 2044.20s]  like I'm just, I'm better just looking at your super kind invincible face. And be careful out
[2044.20s -> 2050.47s]  there. The last thing we need is two people sleeping with the fishes. We need to find a double bed in
[2050.47s -> 2064.65s]  this economy. See you later, friend. Stay safe. Ah, cam off. Hello, esteemed guest. If you're
[2064.73s -> 2068.09s]  looking to leave the restaurant, you'll have to use the exit arrow up in the corner of the screen.
[2069.69s -> 2074.82s]  We provide all our patrons with an exit arrow and complimentary pillow mint.
[2075.82s -> 2079.90s]  Feel free to use both outside of our fine establishment to exit and munch as you wish.
[2080.54s -> 2085.67s]  Just don't mix the two up since that arrow is vintage and known to contain harmful materials
[2085.67s -> 2091.11s]  such as lead paint, asbestos, and a combination of rat poisons and cilantro. Please feel free to
[2091.11s -> 2102.06s]  visit us again here at John Johnny's and have a Johnny of a day. What's up? Okay, that's his cute.
[2103.22s -> 2110.58s]  This is John Johnny's Cafe. New voice unlocked. Cilantro. Ew, cilantro tastes like soap! Shut up.
[2111.22s -> 2124.89s]  It is gross though. I love it. Hey, bub. Got a minute? Or perhaps three minutes? I ain't above
[2124.89s -> 2131.00s]  asking for five. I saw you walking out of John Johnny's over there and I said to myself,
[2131.00s -> 2136.78s]  Vicki, you gotta talk to that mysterious stranger. Vision and pinstripes, says. I ain't
[2136.78s -> 2141.74s]  trying to fluff you up or another, but you look like an alligator of exceptional taste. As well
[2141.74s -> 2145.90s]  as one who might like to dabble in high stakes games of chance and intrigue, if you feel me.
[2146.54s -> 2151.83s]  Oh, don't actually feel me. I got a skin condition. They call me slick for a reason. According to my
[2151.83s -> 2156.87s]  doc, it ain't going away unless I start using that topical cream at night. I gotta listen to
[2156.87s -> 2162.07s]  some jabroni with a smarty certificate, you know what I'm saying? All my spots on the street.
[2162.63s -> 2170.76s]  This is also where I got this skin condition and my impolite lower back tattoo. Whom? What about the
[2170.76s -> 2178.89s]  event? Oh, you know about the event? Ah, look. Well, here, bub, it's a real secret affair, you dig?
[2179.61s -> 2184.09s]  Ain't nobody supposed to be going and telling Pat about it. My lips are sealed just like they
[2184.09s -> 2190.90s]  seal when I wake up after a night of nose only breathing. Hey, who's Pat? You talking about Pat,
[2190.90s -> 2195.94s]  the alligator? Yeah, I know that dude pretty well. You see, yeah, he's my second cousin.
[2196.66s -> 2202.74s]  One time when we was kids, those guys got locked out of CCD after recess and missed juice and
[2202.74s -> 2207.62s]  cookie time. We only had one granola bar between us and good old Pat gave me the bigger half.
[2208.81s -> 2216.33s]  I'll always remember that. No, I ain't crying. I just spit in my own eyes as a display of my street
[2216.33s -> 2226.10s]  toughness. Name's Mickey, but everyone, you know, calls me the old king of the cops.
[2226.90s -> 2230.42s]  Well, that one guy did before he yelled at a fence to stop stealing his email password
[2231.14s -> 2238.22s]  and his pants fell down and he fell down into an open manhole. But I have it on good authority
[2238.22s -> 2243.02s]  from the paramedics that he only called three or five other people that. So by the way,
[2244.06s -> 2251.53s]  the old card king at your service. Oh, maybe no, just maybe if you play a little game with Mickey
[2251.53s -> 2257.67s]  here, my lips might loosen up a little. You can keep an eye on this flurry of fingies and find the
[2257.67s -> 2266.42s]  queen. Yeah. All right. Keep an eye three card Mickey. Yes, let's do it. Mickey's running a
[2266.42s -> 2271.72s]  street scam. Keep an eye on the queen and pick the correct card to foil his plans. All right,
[2271.72s -> 2279.13s]  keep an eye on the queen. All right. Get your peepers peeled because these hands are about
[2279.13s -> 2283.48s]  to become a hurricane. I can't voice act on camera. I have to do it behind the scenes.
[2284.90s -> 2290.26s]  See here. Keep your eyes on the lady. Where is she going to go? Where is she going to go?
[2297.34s -> 2304.15s]  I got it. It was easy. Oh, but oh, don't be feeling too bad. Ain't nobody can.
[2304.15s -> 2306.87s]  What? Wait, what happened? That wasn't even looking.
[2307.59s -> 2312.86s]  Ain't nobody can hold a candle to Mickey's slick hands and catch fire from the mystery grease.
[2313.66s -> 2323.98s]  Maybe I should start using that cream. I wasn't even looking. I actually, I actually wasn't even
[2323.98s -> 2330.01s]  looking. I was looking over here at you guys in the chat. I'll give you the win. Mickey ain't made
[2330.01s -> 2334.87s]  of stone. He's made of a series of tubes filled with a mysterious substance that may or may not
[2334.87s -> 2354.33s]  be slightly corrosive. What? I won? I did it. Oh, geez. Anyways, about the event. Well, yeah.
[2355.29s -> 2358.97s]  Ain't heard it from me, but I hear it's going to be a real affair to remember.
[2359.69s -> 2363.93s]  The whole family's been talking about it for months. That's really going to get here. You
[2363.93s -> 2369.13s]  know what I'm saying? Anyways, thanks for playing. Let me know if you need any of my city smarts
[2369.13s -> 2373.61s]  while you're out here, rookie. Try not to lick any trolley handrails if you can help.
[2374.33s -> 2384.60s]  Those dermatology copays are real kicking the alligator pants. You feel me? Oh, that was fun.
[2384.68s -> 2391.00s]  I did it. Trolley ain't here yet, so why don't you use go check out the arcade? Mickey got banned
[2391.00s -> 2397.21s]  for his slick fingers gumming up the machines and causing an epidermis epidemic. That ain't mean.
[2397.21s -> 2408.82s]  You got to suffer the same fate. Oh, say Goku. Oh, that was cute. Okay. Click and drag up and
[2408.82s -> 2417.14s]  down. Oh, all right. Where should I go from here? The arcade? What time is it? It's 8 30. I got to
[2417.14s -> 2424.84s]  be my what animal am I? Oh, I'm an alligator. I'm an alligator. All right. Where's the, uh,
[2424.84s -> 2436.28s]  where's the arcade? Go. Who is it? Um, hello. Is this by chance your first time in alligator
[2436.28s -> 2444.01s]  New York City? I mean, in the city city, not alligator Long Island or something. Who's this?
[2444.65s -> 2449.93s]  I thought so. Oh, you don't know me. I'm sorry if that's weird. I just thought if you'd like,
[2449.93s -> 2456.09s]  I could text you some tips. City is really big and has a lot of colorful secrets that I wouldn't want
[2456.09s -> 2462.31s]  you to miss on your first visit. Is it okay if I help you out from time to time? Lose this number.
[2463.03s -> 2470.82s]  Leave me the fuck alone. Oh, great. I'll be sure to text you again soon. Don't forget to enjoy
[2470.82s -> 2482.60s]  yourself. Okay. Oh, what's the street street kiter too? I got to play these. I just got a puzzle
[2482.60s -> 2496.28s]  piece. What's that? I got it. All right, let's go. Sweet Geraldine. Hey, up there in long arms. I'll
[2496.28s -> 2503.34s]  be back. Hey, up there in long arms. You got a sec? Nice suit. What's a fancy reptile like you
[2503.34s -> 2508.86s]  doing at the back of the arcade? I know what you're after. That's right. I've got you just by looking
[2508.86s -> 2514.94s]  at you. You want cold hard plush. Oh, you find the right alligator. And I've got a job that'll pay
[2514.94s -> 2520.62s]  for both of our retirements and poorly made stuffies. Auto. You might see a humble claw machine,
[2520.62s -> 2525.35s]  but this is a fault and we're going to break in. We can't just walk in. No, there's countermeasures.
[2525.91s -> 2530.07s]  Sometimes, normally the security guard comes by and says, I'm not allowed to put my con
[2530.07s -> 2534.94s]  chair into the aisle. Without the boost, I'm not tall enough to work the cloth.
[2535.66s -> 2539.43s]  He says it's a fire hazard, but most of the machines in here are. You see behind here,
[2539.43s -> 2545.72s]  that's one hailing power strip juicing up every one of these babies. One wrong move and pinball
[2545.72s -> 2550.12s]  and boom. This place lights up like my chemistry teacher's hair when I turned that Bunsen burner
[2550.12s -> 2559.48s]  too high. What? What the fuck? What do you know about the event? I love to tell you about the
[2559.48s -> 2563.88s]  event. I really would. But this is our first time on the job to get a Mac. You haven't yet earned
[2563.88s -> 2572.52s]  my unbridled trust. Okay. What about Pat? Pat is a Patsy, but not my Patsy. That's for sure.
[2572.52s -> 2578.28s]  It's related to some of my dad's friends. One time at dad's show, Pat pulled the fire alarm
[2578.28s -> 2582.36s]  because he thought someone was trying to set him on fire. Turns out he just had a warm piece of
[2582.36s -> 2586.84s]  pizza in his pocket. No one could find him for almost an hour until the firefighters pulled him
[2586.84s -> 2591.98s]  out of the concert hall's crawlspace. He was covered in spiders and had eaten the pizza,
[2591.98s -> 2601.14s]  but was otherwise unharmed physically anyway. That guy's pretty weird. That was fun voice acting
[2601.14s -> 2605.98s]  for like five minutes. All right, let's go. Me, I'm known around these parts as sweet Geraldine,
[2605.98s -> 2609.74s]  criminal mastermind of the claw machine. You haven't heard of me? Honestly, I'm not surprised.
[2611.13s -> 2616.33s]  I leave no fingerprints and Johnny Law doesn't have a clue. Or Johnny Boyer from my geography
[2616.33s -> 2623.00s]  class. At least that's what he said when I asked him to spring fling. Okay, so what do we have to do?
[2623.72s -> 2628.41s]  Maybe we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement. Claw machine, it's a two man
[2628.41s -> 2632.41s]  operation. I need someone who's not going to rat me out for additional prizes when plush comes to
[2632.41s -> 2645.53s]  shove. You feel me? Low effort streamer. What do you say, old timer? One last claw machine
[2645.53s -> 2658.15s]  score. The big one. All right, let's go. Let's do it. Follow sweet Geraldine's instructions to get
[2658.15s -> 2663.35s]  the perfect claw machine prize. Click left and right to control the crane. When you're ready to
[2663.35s -> 2675.53s]  grab, click the center button. What do you mean? Here she is, the big quesadilla, the motherlode.
[2675.53s -> 2680.26s]  Inside this vault is a treasure trove of prizes. I've had my eye on a couple of choice goods,
[2680.26s -> 2685.78s]  but I need an accomplice with nerves of steel and hands of steel. A tall patsy like you can
[2685.78s -> 2690.66s]  push the buttons and see the prizes. So what do you say? Let's get some cute loots for our cute
[2690.66s -> 2696.74s]  snoots. First, you should warm up your tricky digits. Grab me any prize that catches your eye.
[2696.74s -> 2718.74s]  Go on, old timer. Show me what you got. I'm going for the candy. Right there? I want this. Got it.
[2718.74s -> 2724.14s]  I heard a prize. Let's check the slot. Oh, my dad says I'm not supposed to have too much candy
[2724.14s -> 2728.95s]  because I get hyperactive and prone to fits of father pinching. But I think he just likes
[2728.95s -> 2737.61s]  keeping it all for himself. All right. I got it first try. I got it. Real job begins. How will
[2737.61s -> 2741.85s]  you react when the pressure's on? This time you follow my lead. And you give me that seashell. I
[2741.85s -> 2753.03s]  think it's pretty. What's seashell? Oh, which one? There's two. There's three. They're all the same,
[2753.03s -> 2769.30s]  right? A little bit more. That'll get it. You got one. What is it? I wonder if I'll hear the ocean
[2769.30s -> 2783.27s]  if I put this to my ear. It said glacial melt is changing ocean currents. Whoa, dude. You're really
[2783.27s -> 2786.87s]  good at this, but it's finally time for the big score. I can see it in your eyes. You're ready
[2786.87s -> 2793.42s]  to get the ultimate prize. Get me the doll from the best, most awesome video game franchise of
[2793.42s -> 2798.70s]  all time, Final Friends City. He's the dreamy one with the spiky hair. This is it. The big one.
[2803.27s -> 2818.14s]  Which one? This one here? This one? Can't move it. It's gotta be that one, right? No, I'm not
[2818.14s -> 2829.37s]  gonna be able to get that one. You gotta go for this one. Stop moving. Stop. Is it puzzle piece?
[2831.48s -> 2848.17s]  Where? Oh, shit, there is. All right. Give me that. Oh, I fucked it up. The Onimon anime is a
[2848.17s -> 2852.41s]  bazillion years old and only weird grownups remember it. I bet you'd only get the reference
[2852.41s -> 2859.98s]  of it being here at all if you were totally an old person. I want that puzzle piece. Give me the
[2859.98s -> 2868.26s]  doll from the best, most awesome video game franchise. I think I screwed it all up. I don't
[2868.26s -> 2880.92s]  think I can get it. I have to clear this out, right? Piderman, you know, from that obscure internet
[2880.92s -> 2892.09s]  cartoon. Popcorn? Blue bullet, maybe. I'm Bobman. I'm Piderman. Here's another quarter. Could you
[2892.09s -> 2898.02s]  try again, please? I want the puzzle piece. Wait, I gotta make sure I can get it first try. I might
[2898.02s -> 2910.17s]  be able to get it here. Batman, Piderman. Do I go straight down through here? Through the middle?
[2910.17s -> 2924.44s]  I think I'll get it. That's it, right? Wow. Dirt. Wait, did you put dirt in there? I only have two
[2924.44s -> 2932.87s]  more chances. I think I might be out of luck here. I have to make sure I can get this one. Let me try
[2932.87s -> 2948.01s]  to... What? Did you get the... Oh, no, I didn't. Yikes. Even looking at this guy is like walking
[2948.01s -> 2954.63s]  under a bazillion ladders or yeeting a shattered mirror into hyperspace. Wait, I can get this one
[2954.63s -> 2963.67s]  over here. This one over here. I got it. Can the claw go that far, though? I don't think it can.
[2963.67s -> 2975.00s]  I think I just lost. Oh, I got it. I got the puzzle. You can have this. I get the feeling
[2975.00s -> 2983.85s]  it'll come in handy later. I got it. That's a Nintendo Switch sound. Bad news, old timer.
[2983.85s -> 2995.45s]  That was my very last quarter. I'll retry in 30 minutes. Oh, it makes... I thought it was timed
[2995.45s -> 3006.18s]  out. Okay, 30 minutes is gonna go by. I get it. All right, let's go. Oh, I got it. I got it. I got
[3006.18s -> 3016.95s]  it. That's the punishment. All right, any prize. Doesn't matter. Let's just get one. What's this one?
[3016.95s -> 3027.18s]  Try to get the key, too. A big edie bar. They stopped making these in the 90s. This is just
[3027.18s -> 3032.54s]  like when my science class dug up fossils. But when I found my old retainer under several strata
[3032.54s -> 3047.38s]  layers of anime wall scrolls. What? I want the ducky. The key is gone. How am I supposed to get
[3047.38s -> 3058.87s]  the ducky? What's this anime? There's only one ducky in here. Is this one easier to get or is
[3058.87s -> 3064.76s]  this one easier to get? Probably this one. There it is. Got it. Thank you. Thank you.
[3067.98s -> 3073.58s]  Last year at recess, this girl in my class, Chrissy Baraducci, she got her snoot stuck in
[3073.58s -> 3078.79s]  a hole near the swing set that was full of bees. Anyway, she looked kind of like this after. So,
[3078.79s -> 3089.80s]  I think I'll give it to her as a gift for her beeversary. Okay, you're ready for the ultimate
[3089.80s -> 3095.56s]  surprise. The doll from. Okay, the spiked haired. Okay, there it is. Should I get the key?
[3096.36s -> 3111.72s]  I get the key. No, I don't want Batman. Batman, I haven't seen this guy in a while. I come over
[3111.72s -> 3123.51s]  the house. What? I know you want the doll, but I want the key. Just smash the glass and take it.
[3123.51s -> 3151.00s]  What the fuck? It's gone. All right, whatever. I need to get it. One more try. Just go one,
[3151.00s -> 3157.37s]  two, three, go. Okay, I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done.
[3157.53s -> 3170.71s]  I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I don't want to mess it up. I can't. An hour can't
[3170.71s -> 3176.57s]  go by. I got to do these mini games. It's like 50 mini games. I got to do them all or a reasonable
[3176.57s -> 3191.34s]  amount of them to complete the games program. Right here. Got it. Those sounds are so loud.
[3191.34s -> 3197.02s]  Oh, jeez. I can't believe you got the dreamiest anime game boy from Final
[3197.02s -> 3202.47s]  Friend City, Claude Stripes. Claude, his hair is almost as prickly as his social interactions
[3202.47s -> 3213.35s]  with women. This is exactly what I wanted. Thank you so much for helping me. Claude. Okay.
[3214.23s -> 3217.43s]  I can't believe the big score. Thanks to you, we had a clean getaway.
[3218.39s -> 3226.12s]  Family member badge. All right, go. I'll tell you what you need to know. The event is a secret.
[3226.92s -> 3231.72s]  I'm a gator, not a rat. It's a birthday party. It's a birthday party. It's literally a birthday
[3231.72s -> 3236.36s]  party. It's a surprise birthday party and everyone's invited and he thinks he's going
[3236.36s -> 3240.89s]  to get killed or something. This is a birthday party. That's the birthday party. That's right,
[3240.89s -> 3249.08s]  a classic double cross. That's the calling card of sweet Geraldine master criminal. All right.
[3249.80s -> 3257.96s]  What else we got here? Joanne. Oh, Joanie. Hey there. You up for a real challenge?
[3258.68s -> 3261.88s]  I haven't seen you here before, stranger. Alligator New York City is a big place,
[3261.88s -> 3266.84s]  but we tend to have regulars, you know? Little Rocco and Bonnie over there. Those two are here
[3266.84s -> 3276.94s]  every day, but you, I remember such a visible face like yours. Look at me being a real jerk.
[3276.94s -> 3280.22s]  I don't mean to be giving you a hard time or nothing. I've just been a little frazzled since
[3280.22s -> 3286.30s]  last night. I had a dream that I was a ski ball and some sticky fingered kid kept throwing me
[3286.30s -> 3292.39s]  into the 10 point hole. Over the 50, dingus, I tried to yell, but being a ball and all,
[3292.39s -> 3296.97s]  ding dong couldn't hear me. I woke up in a cold sweat in my kitchen, systematically throwing
[3296.97s -> 3301.08s]  individual oranges from the window into my neighbor's terrarium. Vitamin C would have
[3301.08s -> 3304.60s]  helped me shake it off, but all I had for breakfast was black coffee and a half a can
[3304.60s -> 3312.17s]  leftover candy cigarettes. Well, I got a dream for you. How much time do you have? How much time do
[3312.17s -> 3317.35s]  you have? All right. What is the event? Look, I know you're here spying for Pat for whatever
[3317.35s -> 3321.91s]  reason. That's fine, but I can't tell you family secrets. You feel me? If you haven't been filled
[3321.91s -> 3325.74s]  that hot, you'd have to really impress me. All right, let's go. What do you want me to do?
[3326.54s -> 3346.36s]  It smelled weird. It was a dumb kid. All right. Pat's my cousin and also the most genuine doof I
[3346.36s -> 3355.42s]  know. So you better be nice to him, you hear? He smelled it. I don't know. The thing that popped
[3355.42s -> 3360.38s]  in my head was like the drain commercial with the guys puking. I wouldn't want to have to pop
[3360.38s -> 3366.44s]  you one. I'm told I got a mean left hook and a moderately insulting right hook. A kick that
[3366.44s -> 3371.64s]  could benefit from some anger management courses. I tried to sign up for some calming hot yoga
[3371.64s -> 3378.68s]  at the YACA, but it didn't go over well. You ever get kicked by your own leg? It ain't great, bud.
[3379.48s -> 3386.84s]  It ain't great. My name's Joni or Bologna. If you're my fourth grade bully, come back to fight me.
[3389.00s -> 3395.69s]  You're not, right? Damn. Anyway, I work here at Adelaide's Arcade, sweeping floors and keeping
[3395.69s -> 3400.58s]  all the games running smooth as a baby's balmy behind. I used to work as a greaser in a shop
[3400.58s -> 3405.22s]  downtown, but I left to be closer to my gaming hobby. But let me keep the leather jacket though
[3405.78s -> 3412.68s]  and the company hairstyle. All right, what are we doing? So what do you think? Can you roll the
[3412.68s -> 3418.60s]  ball, old timer? I'm talking pinball, the old pinny B as I like to call it. It's the advice of both
[3418.60s -> 3423.24s]  of my friends, family and the supportive therapist I see on Thursdays. I got the highest score on
[3423.24s -> 3427.48s]  lizard wizards. You're eight months running, but I'm always looking for a real pinhead to
[3427.48s -> 3433.00s]  put my skills against. What do you say? Care to take on a pinball lizard like me? I didn't mean
[3433.00s -> 3441.82s]  to make a joke. I take this very, very seriously. All right, let's go. Pinball. When the ball is in
[3441.82s -> 3473.11s]  play control by clicking L and R or the keyboard, beat 5000 points. Absolutely simple. 5000. I'm
[3473.11s -> 3477.59s]  going to beat this right now. I literally just destroyed it. Has anybody played to beat your
[3477.59s -> 3492.71s]  score? I just annihilated your score. It was, it was embarrassing. I think that's so stupid. I hate
[3492.71s -> 3497.77s]  pinball machines should not have this. There should never be a way for it to fall down the
[3497.77s -> 3503.53s]  left and right without you doing anything. Cause that's not user error. It's designed failure,
[3503.53s -> 3506.65s]  which is like, come on, like that's stupid. I don't know what pinball machines should be like
[3506.65s -> 3523.34s]  completely redesigned. Mad because bad. You can't control that if it goes down there. There's
[3523.34s -> 3536.55s]  nothing you can do about it. What if I get a million points? El ballo. You can influence it.
[3536.55s -> 3548.34s]  What? By like picking the machine up and turning it around? That's illegal. It's illegal. You can't
[3548.34s -> 3567.96s]  tell the pinball machine. You get thrown out. All right. I destroyed the score. You're the annoying
[3567.96s -> 3576.30s]  kid in the arcade spamming the buttons. What? Cause I like the sound. One of the most amazing
[3576.30s -> 3585.45s]  sound effects of all time. They go in this order, running water in a river and pinball flipper sound
[3586.17s -> 3598.23s]  when you press the button. Number three would probably be, I gotta make sure I get this right.
[3601.99s -> 3609.22s]  A perfect swish at a basketball hoop in that order. Opening a can of soda is probably number
[3609.22s -> 3616.02s]  four or five. Hey, it's been a long time since I seen moves like that in front of the lizard wizards
[3616.02s -> 3621.06s]  here. Got that ball hitting all the do what's and who's it so fast. I could barely keep up.
[3621.94s -> 3630.81s]  Releasing a big fart. No, that's not a great sound. That's like a gross sound. It's been a real honor
[3630.81s -> 3634.65s]  to hang with us. Another student of the pinball arts. All right. I got a puzzle piece too.
[3635.61s -> 3640.01s]  Well, the event now, this might be just a rumor, but word of the street, there's going to be some
[3640.01s -> 3646.09s]  sick games there. It's a birthday party, not pinball per se, but you know, he can take what
[3646.09s -> 3651.37s]  you can get. That's all I can really say. I'd better get back on the grind trying to beat my
[3651.37s -> 3656.49s]  last high score. Thanks for showing me your supple wrist and head. Catch you later. All right. Let's
[3656.49s -> 3670.09s]  go. Time is it. Hey, it's me, Pat, the alligator, one with the hat, iPad. It's almost 10 can
[3670.09s -> 3676.54s]  you come back? Someone came over to my table and threatened me. Well, they gave me a coupon and
[3676.54s -> 3685.98s]  told me to have a nice day, but that could mean anything. Nobody came to threaten me.
[3685.98s -> 3691.56s]  One free tomato soup, best in New York City. There's a coupon I got last week. If you come
[3691.56s -> 3698.36s]  back, I'll give it to you. No questions asked. All right. So I gotta go back. Am I on like a time
[3698.36s -> 3716.22s]  limit? An actual time limit? I got some info. I don't bop me. Oh, it's just you, my new friend.
[3717.10s -> 3720.62s]  Sorry, I saw your shadow over me. I thought some kind of restaurant assassin was descending
[3720.62s -> 3732.09s]  from the rafters to take me out. It's a birthday party. Just do what everybody else fucking does.
[3732.81s -> 3738.86s]  And you act surprised even though you know what it is. It's a birthday party. Relax. You're going
[3738.86s -> 3745.51s]  to walk in the door, you're going to walk in the door, you're going to go like the coat off, lights are going
[3745.51s -> 3751.75s]  to come on and you're going to go like that. Just like that. Those of you guys that have ever had a
[3751.75s -> 3755.67s]  surprise birthday party that you knew about, don't get loud because that means you knew about it.
[3756.39s -> 3761.27s]  You have to go like this. You have to have like a bag in your hand or like a coat in your like under
[3761.27s -> 3770.92s]  your arm. You have to go, what the, hey, if you go like, oh, it's like, you know, you played it up.
[3772.36s -> 3776.44s]  You have to have like a bag in your hand, like a, like a grocery bag or like a briefcase or something.
[3776.44s -> 3782.94s]  You have to like be holding it up like this and act kind of surprised. Thanks for the tip. Yeah,
[3782.94s -> 3791.19s]  of course. Don't you, don't you, didn't you have to dare me when you were in elementary school?
[3791.19s -> 3795.67s]  You know, dare, dude, assassins really exist. At least I think that's the acronym.
[3795.67s -> 3800.44s]  I was absent a lot due to my nut allergy. It was tough times for Pat at
[3800.44s -> 3806.15s]  Willie's Peanut Butter Factory Elementary School. That's funny. Anyway, did you find out anything
[3806.15s -> 3811.32s]  from the family? Well, yeah, I know the sound. They sound nice, but they just might be fluffing
[3811.32s -> 3816.97s]  you up, you know, buttering your bread roll to throw you off the trail. All right, I've actually
[3816.97s -> 3821.21s]  just been sitting here mainlining complimentary bread rolls the whole time you were gone.
[3826.20s -> 3832.25s]  I'm a burger boy. We were at, I think we were at, where were we? I think we were at like Outback
[3832.25s -> 3837.83s]  Steakhouse and we ordered like, there was like three or four of us, we ordered entrees and there
[3837.83s -> 3844.81s]  was like this big loaf of bread there, like the, like the free bread. And he didn't like order
[3844.81s -> 3849.37s]  anything. He wasn't hungry or like didn't want to like, he didn't have like any cash. And I think
[3849.37s -> 3853.29s]  we were probably offered to be like, and he's like, no, no, no, I'm not that hungry. But I don't know
[3853.29s -> 3858.54s]  why he like didn't think it was free. I think the waiter came over and he was like, hey, is that free?
[3859.26s -> 3864.09s]  They're like, yeah. And he just goes, oh, nice. And he picked it up and like started eating it.
[3865.35s -> 3872.04s]  It's like what, of course it is. He could have asked us that, right? Hey, hey, so bread, is that
[3872.04s -> 3881.18s]  free? Yeah. I think the waiter was like, yeah. I just kept walking. I don't think everybody
[3881.18s -> 3887.69s]  at the table was like, what the fuck are you talking about? Oh, so funny. All right. Sorry,
[3887.69s -> 3892.79s]  I've actually just been sitting here mainlining complimentary bread rolls. And the bread from
[3892.79s -> 3898.38s]  Outback Steakhouse was actually fucking unbelievable. You can say whatever you want about like some of
[3898.38s -> 3904.31s]  these chain restaurants. I remember that it was, okay, it was like this little loaf. It was like,
[3904.31s -> 3912.09s]  I think it was like pumpernickel, right? What is it? The bread from Outback is like the best thing
[3912.09s -> 3917.66s]  in the whole restaurant, like the whole restaurant. They gave you this kind of butter that you really
[3917.66s -> 3922.41s]  had to really stick the knife in and really move it around. I mean, literally everything else at
[3922.41s -> 3926.73s]  Outback, I don't remember if it was good or not, but that little, it was a tiny little loaf. Oh,
[3926.73s -> 3934.57s]  it's awesome. Yeah. The bread is unbelievable. It's really good there. Is it actually, or is he
[3934.57s -> 3940.68s]  insane? No, no, I swear. Oh, there's a time limit. All right. And let's loggy with bread. Let's go.
[3946.10s -> 3951.22s]  Yeah, there it is. Yep. Yep. Yep. Oh, and the butter too. That butter's perfect. Yep. This is it.
[3951.22s -> 3963.27s]  Hold on. That's it. I think that's exactly what it is. This is the bread from Outback. The only
[3963.27s -> 3981.66s]  thing I remember. Look at the butter too. Yeah. The butter was so good. Like, is it weird that I
[3981.66s -> 3987.40s]  would want to go to Outback and just order like an appetizer and just be like, uh, I would pay for
[3987.40s -> 3992.79s]  the bread, right? Like if, you know, it's like, oh yeah, do you want like more bread? They'll do
[3992.79s -> 3996.07s]  that, right? They'll come back. You want some more bread? But I almost kind of want to be like, hey,
[3996.07s -> 4000.39s]  can you just like, can I just like mac and cheese and just, you bring out like five of these,
[4000.39s -> 4005.22s]  I'll pay for them. Like I pay for whatever you would think they would cost, whatever they are.
[4005.22s -> 4016.18s]  I'll pay for it. Bread tier list. That's how I feel about Olive Garden. Breadsticks from Olive
[4016.18s -> 4023.96s]  Garden are actually really good. Steak houses have like really banging bread. Yeah. You can
[4023.96s -> 4037.53s]  order it to go. Really? Bread makes you fat. So what? All right. My safe place. Find the code to
[4037.53s -> 4048.52s]  Pat's abode. Help Pat remember his room code. Thanks for protecting me. It really helps to have
[4048.52s -> 4053.66s]  someone walk me to my room. The wallpaper in here is a little intense. That makes me feel like
[4053.66s -> 4061.56s]  something is staring at me. What am I going to do? My heart can't take 10 more hours of waiting.
[4062.20s -> 4074.52s]  What's the event? What did I squeal the beans on? Cheese and crackers. Am I going to finally
[4074.52s -> 4086.01s]  catch this for the first time ever? Come on. Every time I think about it, it just doesn't happen.
[4086.57s -> 4093.16s]  I'm ready if it does. Since I was so worried about getting super murdered today, I did the
[4093.16s -> 4098.76s]  smart thing and got a special lock for my hotel room door. Just a little something I picked up
[4098.76s -> 4102.84s]  at the hardware store. I was worried I'd get so nervous that I'd forget the lock's passcode,
[4102.84s -> 4108.76s]  so I saved it on my website, www.allocator.com. I even made a button you can click for it.
[4109.32s -> 4112.36s]  I'm really glad now I took those all these specific button making classes at my local
[4112.36s -> 4122.82s]  community center. Okay. It's a virus website. This is Pat's home page generated by Geo Scalies.
[4126.04s -> 4139.72s]  Warning. Don't click Pat only. About me. Sorry. Under construction. What is that? This is the code?
[4144.06s -> 4160.30s]  About me. I'm Pat. Okay. Don't click Pat only. If you're not Pat, you're breaking the law. This has
[4160.30s -> 4177.93s]  been reported to the computer police. 91619. Okay. I got it. I got it. How do I say I got it?
[4178.49s -> 4202.38s]  91619. Let's go. All right. Here we are. Let's freaking go. Let's freaking go! This is for sure
[4202.38s -> 4206.94s]  my room. You can tell by the unobtrusive lock I installed. Can you go to my website and grab
[4206.94s -> 4223.53s]  the code? Okay. Let's go. 9 for the code. How do I enter the code? Oh. You did it. Thank you so much.
[4224.33s -> 4238.52s]  Whoa. I can't close it. What's going on? Help. You gotta help me. I don't even like pink. What?
[4240.82s -> 4247.05s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Back up. I fucked it up. It's getting on my feet. Enter
[4247.05s -> 4263.46s]  anything. Oh my gosh. Hello. My word. This is quite the mess. Who are you two and why have you opened
[4263.46s -> 4269.99s]  my door? Oh my. I'm Pat. This is my hotel room. I installed this lock because my family's trying to
[4269.99s -> 4275.56s]  rub me out. This is my door where I've installed the lock because my family's trying to rub me
[4275.56s -> 4286.06s]  out. But if that's true and my password still worked, is your lock code 91619? Is your lock
[4286.06s -> 4291.74s]  code 91619? We have the same code and our families are both trying to kill us.
[4295.88s -> 4304.60s]  This is very funny. So long stranger. Perhaps in another life we would have been total best friends.
[4305.16s -> 4310.74s]  Like ships in the night, Mr. Pat. And if you don't tell anyone what you've seen here or I'll come
[4310.74s -> 4324.15s]  for you endlessly. That sure was a string of unlikely coincidences, wasn't it? I hope that
[4324.15s -> 4330.42s]  guy's room is OK. That stuff kind of smells like brimstone. Do we actually have the same code?
[4331.06s -> 4345.24s]  This is awkward. I'm not saying anything. All right. If you have pink stuff in here, it's going
[4345.24s -> 4357.43s]  to be wild. All right. Here we go. Thanks. I never would have remembered that on my own. Come on in.
[4364.26s -> 4367.94s]  I'm so glad we made it inside. Now I can really try to relax. I'll try to distract you from the
[4367.94s -> 4372.42s]  investigation. I'll text you again when it gets closer to 4 p.m. So don't forget to check your
[4372.42s -> 4377.30s]  watch. You know, in case you do get distracted doing a collection of menial tasks, formatted
[4377.30s -> 4391.91s]  in an enjoyable manner. Something like that. All right. Bye for now. Do I have any minigames? Wait,
[4391.91s -> 4417.35s]  who's that? God damn it! It's nice about sitting by yourself in a restaurant with a good book.
[4417.35s -> 4428.97s]  My girlfriend's coming to pick me up after work. I'm so nervous. What's in the kitchen?
[4433.02s -> 4455.13s]  That was so scary and loud. Oh, puzzle piece. Puzzle piece. Oh, wait. Sound effect number five
[4455.13s -> 4467.19s]  in the top five list is coffee pouring into a mug. Yep. Hey, bub, you're just in time for the
[4467.19s -> 4476.92s]  trolley got here a minute ago. OK. Why don't you go check out the city? Bring Mickey a hot dog,
[4476.92s -> 4484.23s]  maybe, or some protective handware. I'm gross. OK. But hold on, there's people here.
[4484.95s -> 4490.47s]  Who's this? If we eat a John, Johnny's here, food's all right, but that bottomless chowder
[4490.47s -> 4494.87s]  bowl was a disaster. I picked that thing up and bam! Chowdered pants the rest of the day.
[4495.59s -> 4503.69s]  Classic work of comedy. Classic comedy. Oh dear, I think I may have left my scrapbooking scissors
[4503.69s -> 4508.25s]  at home on accident. Oh, I found my scissors must have been your approach that gave me good luck,
[4508.25s -> 4513.13s]  stranger. Hee hee. I'm gonna try to go outside, home more, since I had the new baby.
[4513.93s -> 4516.57s]  Nana is watching her today, so here I am, out in the world.
[4518.09s -> 4521.37s]  A little nerve wracking to be away from the nursery after those months, to be honest.
[4522.25s -> 4528.25s]  Oh, I already miss all the new baby smells. Well, not all the smells. We all know more things come
[4528.25s -> 4532.87s]  out of babies than just sweet fragrance of their cute little heads. Well, even that stuff is a
[4532.87s -> 4542.30s]  little cute. Hee hee. I'm Maria. It's wonderful to meet you. I was heading to the local YACA
[4542.30s -> 4546.46s]  before I ran into you. I'm taking a class there today on scrapbooking, but I'm a little early.
[4547.42s -> 4553.34s]  I meant to wait here in the lovely weather until their class on mom yoga and self-defense ends.
[4554.22s -> 4565.62s]  Eat, pray, shove. Hee hee. Do you mean my son Pat? Oh, I'm just so proud of him. It's his birthday
[4565.62s -> 4573.30s]  today. Did I fucking talk with you? I told all of you. Why is he not doing voices? This is depressing.
[4574.34s -> 4582.28s]  What? It's his long game. It's a birthday. It's a birthday. I told you it's a birthday.
[4583.00s -> 4588.55s]  He's so funny with how he treats himself to a hotel stay every year on the day. He just
[4588.55s -> 4600.50s]  loves that continental breakfast. Voices or riot. You're going to make me get up and sing?
[4602.14s -> 4608.14s]  Oh, yeah. Jeremy has a really good voice. Don't you, Jeremy? Why don't you get up and sing for
[4608.14s -> 4623.74s]  us? Twinkle twinkle little star. I don't want to do that. I don't want to do it.
[4626.68s -> 4631.00s]  I do get concerned he eats too many of those, however. Sud shouldn't be coming out the snoot
[4631.00s -> 4646.41s]  of a boy that age. What about the event? It's his birthday. The event is why I'm taking this class
[4646.41s -> 4656.44s]  today. Okay, so what do you need? Help a mom out. Trying to put together a family tree to bring
[4656.44s -> 4663.06s]  tonight. Yeah, I don't have everyone's picture. It's so hard for all of us to get together in one
[4663.06s -> 4667.70s]  place these days. I don't think anyone would like me to use their photos from the early 2000s.
[4667.70s -> 4672.26s]  We all made some questionable wardrobe decisions back then. Since you're already going around town,
[4672.26s -> 4685.35s]  would you mind snapping some pictures of the family? And you get to and you get and bring back
[4685.35s -> 4688.39s]  a foot in the family tree. Maybe if you get them all, something good will happen.
[4689.19s -> 4709.29s]  Oh, I see you already have one there. Can you put it in? Let's see how much you learned so far.
[4709.85s -> 4724.14s]  Okay, what do I know so far? Click and drag the alligator portraits in a position of the family
[4724.14s -> 4736.62s]  tree. Come back any time to see your collection. Oh my god, there's so many people. How many people
[4736.62s -> 4751.72s]  are in this family? It's like the Elden Ring family tree. Like there's a fucking million people.
[4752.44s -> 4779.02s]  I don't know anybody. Can I take your picture? Where's my camera? Ain't nobody can follow these
[4779.02s -> 4791.21s]  ferocious fingies. Where's my camera? I want to take a picture of these people. You already got
[4791.21s -> 4797.99s]  her picture, but now I take pictures of everybody else. All right, let's go to the fun district.
[4798.63s -> 4824.66s]  I'm in the fun district. You got them from the mini game. Oh god, unknown. Again, you're a friendly
[4824.66s -> 4832.14s]  city guide here. So I was wondering, have you been finding any puzzle pieces around? I'm going to
[4832.14s -> 4842.50s]  write in all capitals, stop, unsubscribe. I thought so. You can find a lot of fun things you might not
[4842.50s -> 4847.38s]  expect in the city by clicking around. Puzzle pieces, secret baubles to look at, interestingly
[4847.38s -> 4854.07s]  shaped sewer rats. It's a real menagerie. Maybe if you find enough pieces, you'll be able to do
[4854.07s -> 4859.27s]  something good with them. Like unlock something. Maybe make a small blanket for a family of chilly
[4859.27s -> 4867.56s]  squirrels. The world is so bright. Have lots of fun looking around. Oh, there's all kinds of, wait,
[4867.56s -> 4873.90s]  I sell bugs. Bugs, bugs. All right, I'm going off. You know that there's like an old person
[4873.90s -> 4880.20s]  I'm going to do this, right? Bugs, bugs for sale. More than one even, unlike what the sign implies.
[4882.04s -> 4888.62s]  Yeah, I sell bugs here. No, not for baiting, for eating. We're alligators and we eat bugs,
[4888.62s -> 4891.74s]  which is something you know because you exist here, canonically.
[4892.78s -> 4900.74s]  Anyway, get bug buying or goodbye, kiddo. Ain't got all day. But I got to sell bugs to feed my
[4900.74s -> 4908.55s]  family with different bugs, which I buy with an alligator currency. What do you know about the
[4908.55s -> 4917.22s]  event? The event? I'm not quite sure what you're talking about. I have a selective memory disorder,
[4917.22s -> 4924.31s]  you see, and that I forget about things I don't really want to go to. What do you know about Pat?
[4925.19s -> 4930.39s]  Oh, did you say Pat? That's my grandson's name, but also the name of the nurse that comes to
[4930.39s -> 4936.39s]  massage the kinks out of my tail on Tuesdays. Did you mean Pat or Pat? You'll have to speak
[4936.39s -> 4940.55s]  up. I'm hard of hearing due to a condition where I stop listening mid-sentence and think about the
[4940.55s -> 4950.12s]  war. Most people call me Capulli, but my real name is Mortimer Giles, Jr., the third and a half,
[4950.84s -> 4955.72s]  on account of my grandfather being perfectly bisected by a wheat thresher during the Great
[4955.72s -> 4960.60s]  Depression. Miraculously, he's survived, but his life wasn't without its problems.
[4961.24s -> 4964.44s]  That's just how it was hard to see him when he turned directly to one side.
[4965.80s -> 4969.56s]  Grandpa, where are you, we'd called, but you know Vail, he'd already slipped through a crack
[4969.56s -> 4975.13s]  in the decorative neolium. It's the last time we ever saw him, and also when those basement
[4975.13s -> 4980.17s]  sounds started up. Well, look at me rambling here to a youth about cellar screams and the like.
[4983.05s -> 4987.93s]  Perhaps you can jog this old man's memory if you help me out with a favor. You see,
[4987.93s -> 4993.05s]  the only photo I have left of my dear late wife, Martha, has also been the victim of a wheat
[4993.05s -> 4998.81s]  thresher incident. I can't seem to put it back together again. Oh, how I'd give anything to see
[4998.81s -> 5005.53s]  Martha's sweet smile again. Can I help this old softy gaze upon his love, lost love once more?
[5007.93s -> 5014.57s]  Sure, Grandpa, I'll help you. Get the pieces glued for this old dude. Make my wife please.
[5016.70s -> 5022.39s]  Like a block to slide it into the empty space would be a very simple picture to gaze upon
[5022.39s -> 5039.22s]  the alligator's beautiful wife. Am I actually on a timer for this? All right,
[5039.22s -> 5068.14s]  this is gonna go off. Fuck, I'm so bad at these. You have no idea. Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait.
[5072.94s -> 5084.36s]  Oh, it's close. It's close. It's close. I got it. I got it. Almost. I got it. I got it. I just did
[5084.36s -> 5089.45s]  it. I got it. I just did it. I literally just did it. That was in record time. That's it. I just did
[5089.45s -> 5108.42s]  it. Oh dear, it seems you've seen the other side now with my secret wife. Could you put this one
[5108.42s -> 5123.05s]  back together too? If not for me then for creepy old coot grandpas everywhere? What? Oh no. What
[5123.05s -> 5126.41s]  the hell? I don't know. This is gonna take so long. I'm not gonna be able to do this one.
[5127.05s -> 5156.97s]  This has got to go top left. Just get this where it needs to be. Is that the right way? I think
[5156.97s -> 5168.10s]  this is probably like that, right? This? I don't know. What? It looks like you're not very good
[5168.10s -> 5180.10s]  at this. No, not taking this. Okay, that's correct but I gotta get it over there.
[5187.27s -> 5206.55s]  All right. Why are there two? Why are there like three people in this picture? Who is this?
[5213.30s -> 5227.30s]  Where does this go? Somebody in the front? Whose head belongs on here? I don't get it.
[5228.30s -> 5257.54s]  Whose fucking head goes on here? All right, it's that one and then there's three people in this
[5257.54s -> 5289.54s]  picture. Oh, leave me alone. This is here. All right, wait, wait, wait. Okay, so he's all the way
[5289.54s -> 5353.21s]  to the left, right? She's in the middle, right? Right? Fuck. This is hard. That's not right.
[5356.02s -> 5362.78s]  I'm so confused. Is it? Wait, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Bring everything down. Bring everything down.
[5362.78s -> 5384.74s]  Bring everything down. Shit. I can't do these. This is too much. This is, this is correct but
[5384.74s -> 5484.04s]  I don't want to touch this. Damn it. This is down here. Fuck. Chat, please be supportive. Dude,
[5484.04s -> 5494.31s]  it's hard. You're nearly there. I know. I'm almost there. I just gotta get it correct. All right,
[5494.31s -> 5512.34s]  this has got to go up there. Let me just get it over there. Okay, that's done. This whole side is
[5512.34s -> 5559.51s]  done. Don't touch it. Fuck. It's close. So close. Come on. All right, don't touch this one. Can I
[5559.51s -> 5588.84s]  do it without touching that? I'm melting. I'm doing it. It's so close. I'm almost there.
[5589.40s -> 5595.61s]  This has got to come over here. All right, I just got to do this.
[5634.49s -> 5655.88s]  Stop making fun of me. What's it doing? Get out of here. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do
[5655.88s -> 5664.18s]  it. I can't do it. It's like, it's too, it's like my brain cannot do it. My brain can't do it. Even
[5664.18s -> 5669.70s]  if I sit there and think for a second, it's just like, like that's all I hear. All I hear in my
[5669.70s -> 5737.75s]  head is the net. There's nothing with that sound. Ah, I can't. It's so easy. This is harder than
[5737.75s -> 5745.40s]  millennia. I beat millennia. Look, everybody has a left left brain and a right brain. Okay.
[5746.36s -> 5754.68s]  My left brain is this big. It's this big. It's like you'd have to go under a microscope to look
[5754.68s -> 5763.24s]  at it. My right brain is so large, it's swelling up my skull. You get it? It's like, oh my goodness,
[5763.24s -> 5768.23s]  it's swelling up so much. I can't, it's so much. You have to go to a microscope to find the other
[5768.23s -> 5777.18s]  side. A microscope. Left brain, right brain is a myth. Yeah, but whatever. You could like,
[5777.18s -> 5780.54s]  whatever. We can speculate. We don't even know. Okay. We don't know how the dinosaurs died. We're
[5780.54s -> 5789.08s]  speculating. It was a meteor. Yeah, we don't know that. We don't know how they died. They could have
[5789.08s -> 5791.88s]  something else going to happen. They could have like eaten each other. There could have been like
[5791.88s -> 5798.92s]  an explosion from a volcano. Not a meteor. Who knows? We don't know. A big rock, you don't know.
[5798.92s -> 5803.16s]  A big rock could have hit it. Yeah. But also, there could have been like a volcano that erupted
[5803.16s -> 5811.43s]  a huge one. A super mega volcano. Right? Nobody knows. All we can do is we can look at fossils
[5811.43s -> 5816.55s]  on the ground and go, that was a meteor. I think. Yep. We don't know. Nobody knows. We don't know.
[5816.55s -> 5819.51s]  You don't know. You don't know anything. You don't know anything. This puzzle is hard. You couldn't
[5819.51s -> 5854.44s]  do it. All right. All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Bro, there's like one thing I
[5854.44s -> 5864.65s]  can't do and it's these fucking sliding puzzles. Break up the right column. I, who cares? What is
[5864.65s -> 5869.21s]  the, who cares if you can't do a sliding puzzle? Does it really matter? Does that really matter
[5869.21s -> 5875.45s]  that much? That doesn't matter. Oh, you can't do one of those. Oh, does it matter? Oh, I can't do
[5875.45s -> 5911.34s]  it. Oh no, I can't do the sliding puzzles. I can't, who cares? Oh, I got it. What if there was a
[5911.34s -> 5915.98s]  life-threatening situation where there was an escape room and you had to get out within 10 minutes
[5915.98s -> 5924.07s]  for that? Or like, no, I'm dead. I'm just dead. I'm going to die. I literally die. I literally die.
[5926.12s -> 5932.60s]  One of you could have said in the chat, hey dude, I'm going to give, um, 50 million dollars in bits
[5932.60s -> 5938.04s]  if you do this in 10 minutes. I wouldn't do it. I actually wouldn't have been able to do it. I
[5938.04s -> 5944.89s]  would have been like, oh my god, I wouldn't have done it. I just wouldn't have done it. I got it
[5944.89s -> 5958.94s]  though. That was fun. Oh, Gertie, good old Gertie. It's been years since I've looked upon your sweet,
[5958.94s -> 5964.06s]  curly hair and your man-breaking arms. Thank you so much for your help, stranger. Thanks to you,
[5964.06s -> 5969.56s]  I'm reunited with both my lost loves. I just have like this red image sitting here.
[5970.52s -> 5980.17s]  Far the past years ago, but Gertie is just in witness protection, you know, from all the
[5980.17s -> 5986.71s]  man-breaking. What a firecracker, that gal. On full days, I could still feel the phantom
[5986.71s -> 5995.29s]  broken body pains she left me. Hey, a vent? Oh, you mean tonight's a vent? You young folk love
[5995.29s -> 6001.85s]  staying up late. Me, I've been bed by six nightly after a modest dinner of soft bug puddings and
[6001.85s -> 6008.01s]  four to seven episodes of soft flutes on public broadcast. Anyway, kiddo, thanks again for helping
[6008.01s -> 6014.87s]  me out, or should I say helping three out. Yeah, don't tell my grandkids. And look, here's a little
[6014.87s -> 6029.72s]  something for your trouble. All right, no more slide puzzles and we'll be fine. The breeze,
[6029.72s -> 6044.63s]  the practicing quartet, what a perfect day to be a live alligator. Sleepy pants. Oh no, the snipper.
[6045.59s -> 6051.06s]  Are you here about joining the resistance? Come to the front door, but don't let the feds tail you.
[6051.70s -> 6057.06s]  Password is the only thing worth fighting for. Justice Absolute, which is also the name of my
[6057.06s -> 6064.41s]  favorite Mark's Leaning Ska Band. Yes, I said favorite. There are more than one. There are two,
[6064.41s -> 6069.05s]  as a matter of fact. Their first single was about putting a potato in the tailpipe of a
[6069.05s -> 6074.81s]  crooked alligator governor when he tried to join their mailing list. No GMOs. That's no
[6074.81s -> 6085.02s]  governors may opt in. Which event? I have four events to go to this week alone. Like tomorrow,
[6085.02s -> 6090.78s]  it's Minestrone Monday at the soup kitchen. Then it's onto Taco Tuesday at the women's shelter.
[6091.42s -> 6096.22s]  Wednesday doesn't have a funny name, but everyone does get those cupcakes with the white squiggly
[6096.22s -> 6100.22s]  as an extra at the alligator food bank. If you're talking about tonight though,
[6100.22s -> 6105.34s]  you might as well go act like a cop somewhere else, officer pinstripes. I don't rat out my
[6105.34s -> 6112.22s]  comrades. My name is bolted up so tight the count of Monte Cristo has spent years trying to escape
[6112.22s -> 6117.66s]  from me while plotting his vengeance against those who wronged him. We just finished reading
[6117.66s -> 6122.78s]  that book in my Tuesday Lit class. Pretty baller to be honest. I love revenge and breakfast.
[6123.66s -> 6131.06s]  What do you know about Pat? Do you mean Hat Pat or do you mean Bat Pat? No, no, you probably
[6131.06s -> 6138.18s]  mean Hat Pat. Bat Pat is my high school neighbor that used to pick me up for DSA meetings on Friday
[6138.18s -> 6145.94s]  until he got grounded. He'd apparently broken his nice favorite set of extremely fragile and large
[6145.94s -> 6152.10s]  eyed porcelain deer with something. A club? Well it's not important. We'll spring him eventually.
[6152.10s -> 6157.86s]  Yes dad, I mean legally. Anyway, Hat Pat is an okay dude. I barely know the guy but he still made
[6157.86s -> 6166.90s]  me punch proof vest to wear to protest out of Dr. Soda bottle caps. He's a stand up alligator.
[6167.78s -> 6171.46s]  Maybe he drinks too much soda though. Doesn't he know what the government puts in that stuff?
[6172.58s -> 6176.02s]  I tell you but the CIA agent that watches my cell phone would probably delete my
[6176.02s -> 6185.11s]  chumbler in vengeance. That's where I keep all my pictures of day one. Okay. I'm Mona but you can
[6185.11s -> 6191.83s]  call me by my online handle for safety which is kpopangel85 but I can have other interests
[6191.83s -> 6198.04s]  besides the cause. All right what do you what do you what do you want me to do? Listen I'm not
[6198.04s -> 6202.36s]  trying to give you crud about Pat or something. I'm just a little stressed out. I don't have to go
[6202.36s -> 6209.40s]  all first world probes on you bobs but I have a design due to be scanned tomorrow afternoon.
[6210.12s -> 6214.12s]  If I miss this deadline it won't get printed in time for the indie comics annual people with
[6214.12s -> 6221.29s]  bangs convention this weekend. You know how long it takes to staple a stack of these zines? At
[6221.29s -> 6226.41s]  least two full episodes listening to gator crater a true crime podcast about the world's most blown
[6226.41s -> 6233.66s]  up alligators. Yes dad I also have Algebra 2 homework. If you know we put some of these pictures
[6233.66s -> 6238.54s]  together maybe I could give you the straight dope about the dope. Get ready to join the resistance.
[6239.50s -> 6244.68s]  Okay make paper words salad because your voice is valid smells like
[6244.68s -> 6252.44s]  zine spirit. Mona's zine needs to cover three topics evenly choose a clip to add to the zine
[6252.44s -> 6255.64s]  and click the page to glue it in place because some clips cover two topics at once.
[6257.88s -> 6262.66s]  So check it pinstripes I've already done all the hard zine stuff like picking the clips and
[6262.66s -> 6267.43s]  cutting everything with semi-straight lines. I need you to pick a good selection then glue them
[6267.43s -> 6274.39s]  into place. Sadly ever since the stickening of 2017 I'm not allowed to use glue myself
[6275.03s -> 6279.75s]  or glue sticks or rubber cement or large stickers or small stickers so you're gonna have to be the
[6279.75s -> 6286.47s]  hero that sticks the pics. This sign encompasses of course the most the three most important most
[6286.47s -> 6292.55s]  ziny things possible. I'm talking about social issues indie comics and k-pop obviously. These
[6292.55s -> 6296.31s]  three topics go together like peanut butter jelly and a third comparable thing that escapes me at
[6296.31s -> 6302.63s]  this moment. That doesn't mean we can lean into any one more than the other. My zine has to be
[6302.63s -> 6307.75s]  balanced or people will think I'm biased. That means no page space for anything more than the other.
[6308.55s -> 6312.87s]  So pick up a pic and get ready to stick careful though I have a limited selection of content
[6312.87s -> 6320.14s]  and my glue is forever just ask my hamster. Grip in Valhalla goopy the third 2015 to 2017.
[6321.46s -> 6331.30s]  zine for god's sake zine what magazine oh a magazine when you're done we'll ask the
[6331.30s -> 6338.09s]  editor if it's ready to scan so get pasting okay so what was it cover is really important
[6338.09s -> 6343.77s]  as to portray the essence of what's on the inside really choosing what ironically humorous t-shirt
[6343.77s -> 6351.64s]  to sport at Rosh Hashana that'll really unsettle your extended family wait what no I didn't want
[6351.64s -> 6359.64s]  to choose that heat it wibbly fin this will get him cancelled for sure I don't know I just
[6359.64s -> 6366.57s]  clicked on the first one don't forget to balance the topics okay I wouldn't want anyone to accuse
[6366.57s -> 6378.39s]  me of political bias or standing bias okay so we already did wibbly fin right this one guys together
[6378.39s -> 6392.92s]  forever together forever okay what's this one is it a meme all right oh well I'm going to send this
[6392.92s -> 6397.08s]  to everyone I know and some people like don't if you type random numbers into your phone they
[6397.08s -> 6403.66s]  have to go somewhere right Jesus do we really want someone who eat do we really want someone
[6403.66s -> 6416.50s]  who eat a sad lunch for another term in office oh my god I mean that's fucking crazy that's so
[6416.50s -> 6425.26s]  like sad to be honest this one kind of mondo bums me out I didn't win the zine award last year
[6425.50s -> 6435.99s]  last year's calm but I did place third in cool bangs Joshua Ransom oh okay wait this is a
[6435.99s -> 6440.47s]  like celebrity or something I didn't really get an interview this is just what I hope he'd say to me
[6440.47s -> 6451.99s]  ah I love you JR hope you read this this is balancing it out right question oh okay that's
[6451.99s -> 6456.39s]  okay I love you what type of girls do you like oh any kind but most of the kind that are like you
[6456.39s -> 6463.34s]  on the inside this one's a real exclusive I can't believe we got it last inside page is a hard
[6463.34s -> 6468.46s]  hitter you have to really leave them wanting more like really actually more like maybe they'll give
[6468.46s -> 6479.75s]  you a couple more bucks to pick up a few more for their comrades this is lois she feels wibbly fin
[6479.75s -> 6486.42s]  is an inadequate mayor balance the budget he can't even balance on this log in his own yard
[6486.42s -> 6491.14s]  nonetheless all right yeah this is particularly damning but I pride my zines on delivering
[6494.15s -> 6500.55s]  health care or public restroom chocolate fountain wibbly fin would rather save the scales
[6500.55s -> 6509.11s]  on his back than weigh in on what matters we are but no it can't be too we can't be too political
[6510.65s -> 6517.54s]  we can't be too this is we've already got political well I will always be so alone I
[6517.54s -> 6523.78s]  just need to be on my own at least this guy misunderstands is still streaming final season
[6523.78s -> 6534.63s]  this one really taps into the deep well of the soul we're almost there just paste on the back
[6534.63s -> 6546.09s]  cover and we'll be done mayor wibble fin uncompromising hair partisan teeth he's got an
[6546.09s -> 6554.34s]  okay hand cherry mandarin fingers embezzling tail mayor wibbly fin would make a terrible
[6554.34s -> 6558.58s]  addition to the k-pop group eight guys and therefore we should examine what type of
[6558.58s -> 6563.70s]  politicians we really want to hold office in our beloved city as you can see from this photo
[6563.70s -> 6568.42s]  he just doesn't fit and therefore the case is made that he's out of touch despite his effort
[6568.42s -> 6579.82s]  to not look out of touch and looks gross here in this photo okay I don't like it so it makes
[6579.82s -> 6588.10s]  me feel there's a really solid case you're all done hand it over I said fair and balanced but
[6588.10s -> 6592.34s]  you're clearly favoring one topic over the others I should have known better than to ask an outsider
[6592.34s -> 6599.74s]  what I got it wrong what oh my god all right it's this three topics let me just get it right
[6602.17s -> 6612.50s]  shit all right not more than one or the other okay okay okay okay okay I the the mayor ones
[6612.50s -> 6619.99s]  which is kind of funny all right we're gonna start with the mayor exposing the mayor okay
[6620.79s -> 6633.88s]  expose start with a mayor then not too much mayor so we're gonna go with this is the band
[6633.88s -> 6643.05s]  eight guys so we have one for the mayor one for eight guys now I need okay this is like a
[6643.61s -> 6655.00s]  little comic book or something meme okay so I've got one of each sad meal we have two mayors and
[6655.00s -> 6670.10s]  one of the others two mayors this is also because we have two eight guys and two mayors okay now we
[6670.10s -> 6682.31s]  need something that's not the mayor or eight guys is this one no no shit this is three eight guys
[6682.31s -> 6695.77s]  two mayor one of something else this is three mayor nope wait hold on oh here we go yep all
[6695.77s -> 6706.34s]  right this is like a comic book we have three eight guys two mayor two right right it's a comic
[6706.34s -> 6712.06s]  book all right so we're almost there just paste on the back cover so now we need another uh comic
[6712.06s -> 6722.73s]  book right is that gonna be all right this one right that'd be three two three is that two three
[6722.73s -> 6732.76s]  two will that be enough is this eight guys oh that's eight guys no I didn't want to click I
[6732.76s -> 6737.26s]  wanted to put it over it okay whatever we do again we're gonna do it again we're gonna do it
[6737.26s -> 6743.94s]  whatever whatever whatever I wanted to switch it I just click paste we're gonna another hour is
[6743.94s -> 6753.29s]  gonna go by all right fuck okay help me retract shit I wanted to move it okay okay okay okay what
[6753.29s -> 6763.58s]  do I start with I'm not gonna start with the mayor there's too many mayors don't open with the mayor
[6764.38s -> 6774.23s]  open with um this one I'm gonna open with the comic book one right that makes sense
[6775.85s -> 6790.63s]  indie comic one now I can do I can do eight guys and the mayor okay so we need to do meme
[6791.43s -> 6801.98s]  and now we need a mayor there we go we're pretty balanced now right so that's two comic one of the
[6801.98s -> 6814.76s]  other ones okay here we go this is two comic two um eight guys right oh wait no no no wait
[6814.76s -> 6824.38s]  this is eight guys person this is both eight guys is this a comic okay wait so this is eight guys
[6824.38s -> 6835.35s]  yep okay so we have two eight guys two comic one mayor we need another mayor okay we gotta balance
[6835.35s -> 6843.21s]  this up what's this one we need a mayor eight guys the last one needs to be a comic and that's it
[6844.76s -> 6857.53s]  right mayor and comic I don't have mayor in comic do I don't I my only options are our mayor right
[6858.25s -> 6869.26s]  so eight guys comic no comic for the back cover you will have to have a comic term of two people
[6869.98s -> 6880.71s]  the last one can be mayor eight guys burgers and fries by the way keep comic mayor which I do
[6881.35s -> 6889.58s]  right now it's one politics two k-pop two indie comic so this would be two two two but fuck help
[6889.58s -> 6900.52s]  me mayor then comic book this is mayor now we get comic book and then the back cover is eight guys
[6900.52s -> 6917.88s]  and that's it that's it right I think back cover is comic book I think that's correct then we end
[6917.88s -> 6929.29s]  up with the comic and that's it we got it got it that's it no that's eight guys fuck did I get it
[6929.93s -> 6942.33s]  that's two three does this count as both back cover is mayor and this is comic though technically
[6942.33s -> 6962.14s]  right you the mayor one this counts as mayor and comic this one is mayor and comic right you
[6962.14s -> 6970.55s]  cringe I think that's good that should be it right this is mayor and k-pop mayor I need mayor and
[6970.55s -> 6990.36s]  comic all right this is gonna be the one what do I need comic was the cover this is this is it all
[6990.36s -> 7000.23s]  right that's it that would be three three three I'm just gonna write fucking down I'm gonna write
[7000.23s -> 7006.06s]  this shit down I'm I can't I've ran out of time I've run out of time I didn't I didn't know that
[7006.06s -> 7017.75s]  too they could be two different things fuck god damn it all right I get it I'm gonna write it down
[7017.75s -> 7045.83s]  I'm literally gonna write it down all right what are we doing okay cover needs to be comic we got
[7045.83s -> 7054.62s]  one comic some covers are two topics all right so we need the cover we need the comic cover
[7055.99s -> 7076.23s]  all right then we want may no eight guys be one eight guys I don't know which one covers all three
[7076.87s -> 7095.93s]  this one does because this would be one eight guys and then this is that's good now we need a
[7095.93s -> 7110.31s]  mayor one mayor which is right here fuck um comic this is too comic or should I do two eight guys
[7110.87s -> 7128.74s]  this would be too comic cover is all three one no this is too comic too comic well we have two
[7128.74s -> 7137.64s]  comic one eight guys now this is mayor that would be two comic one eight guys one mayor
[7141.24s -> 7156.70s]  okay and this is eight guys this is this is this is eight guys there'll be two eight guys
[7157.42s -> 7171.66s]  is that we two comic two eight guys one mayor am I doing the same thing okay that's
[7171.66s -> 7185.43s]  two comic two eight guys one mayor now I need um I need mayor that'd be two two that'd be two two two
[7188.54s -> 7198.09s]  this would be two two two this would be three guys three this is what is this two mayor now
[7200.25s -> 7213.56s]  and then putting this would be three guys two mayor um eight not three what this is one comic
[7213.56s -> 7219.05s]  one this is I wrote I wrote I fucking wrote something down I fucked it up right now I'm at
[7219.05s -> 7231.54s]  two two one so this would be I'm so confused because this accounts as two left brain logic
[7231.54s -> 7243.21s]  I'll dodge an axe if you swing it at me I I've lost I'm you know I gotta turn the music off it's
[7243.21s -> 7248.33s]  like literally fucking with my brain all right music off we got two two one right now this would
[7248.33s -> 7261.05s]  be three two two right three two two three two two if I put this here I'm just fucking doing it
[7261.05s -> 7269.21s]  I don't care I'll leave I'm leaving if I don't get it right three two two that's three comic two
[7269.21s -> 7279.48s]  eight guys two mayor now I need this would be three mayor I just need one eight guys on the back
[7280.12s -> 7284.76s]  and I'm done because that would be three comic two eight guys three mayor that's it I just need
[7284.76s -> 7294.82s]  comic on the back and that's it right I just need just comic on the back is it is it not possible
[7295.54s -> 7310.49s]  I need comic on back no comic is on the back of the eight guys what there are no comic on the back
[7310.49s -> 7318.02s]  there is none so if I do this this would be free I stop I have to stop writing shit down before
[7318.02s -> 7327.27s]  it happens so this is comic I'm just gonna look up the solution all the backs are two topics
[7327.99s -> 7336.07s]  there are no comics for the back so this this would get us to three comic right

[7421.48s -> 7427.29s]  what happened to Shake Shack but holy shit it fell off hard so hard you want to know something
[7427.29s -> 7434.18s]  fucked up you know I I was a Shake Shack fan I was an absolute Shake Shack maniac um I've had it a
[7434.18s -> 7443.05s]  few times and holy shit it fell the fuck off so bad the last time I've ordered Shake Shack the
[7443.05s -> 7449.72s]  burger's been like not good it's like the texture length has been weird and if you get lettuce on a
[7449.72s -> 7454.12s]  Shake Shack burger this is just my this is what's happened to me the last few times this might not
[7454.12s -> 7461.02s]  be your experience but holy shit it's been mine dude the lettuce is like one tiny little joke
[7461.02s -> 7468.54s]  piece of wilted like wet gross lettuce like this it was dog shit dog shit I'm not even knocking it
[7468.54s -> 7475.35s]  was dog shit if you open the bun of like a recent Shake Shack burger it fucking looks like this
[7476.15s -> 7484.17s]  and it's like just it's one tiny little pathetic piece yeah I had a five guys burger the lettuce
[7484.17s -> 7489.69s]  was fucking big and crispy it was a tomato it was a big thick delicious tomato burger was cooked
[7489.69s -> 7496.17s]  perfectly I have to amend the fast food tier list Shake Shack literally went down to like a B
[7496.73s -> 7504.86s]  maybe even lower it sucks literally was my favorite place I'm sorry like you you know I'm not a
[7504.86s -> 7510.86s]  bullshitter I it was up an S tier but but why was there tomato on it I just felt like it one day
[7510.86s -> 7515.50s]  I know tomatoes I don't tomatoes gross I just felt like it it was good I felt like it I felt
[7515.50s -> 7520.97s]  like it you fell off shut up I felt like it today I didn't eat it today you know what I mean I felt
[7520.97s -> 7528.31s]  like it like recently I felt like eating tomato on my burger I felt like it I had to test to see
[7528.31s -> 7535.51s]  how juicy and firm and crispy it was you know I mean I had to test it because if your lettuce
[7535.51s -> 7539.51s]  if your vegetables I get to check and see that because that's important I don't like lettuce
[7539.51s -> 7544.42s]  tomato on a hamburger but I had to try to see how well it was it's crispy it was juicy and
[7544.42s -> 7559.51s]  watery and delicious calm the fuck down dude you know oh that's pretty rad tagline if I had public
[7559.51s -> 7563.83s]  access channel talk show which is 100% of the cards by the way if I keep a B plus his second
[7563.83s -> 7569.27s]  term that would definitely be my sassy catchphrase anyways the event is a gross allocation of funds

[14688.68s -> 14696.10s]  and big which i also like broad shoulders she says he's cool quiet type but he has a sense of
[14696.10s -> 14702.68s]  humor and a big heart and between you and me she said he's a real dragon in the dojima if you
[14702.68s -> 14709.02s]  catch my drift i wonder what she told him about me while this negative thinking is messing with
[14709.02s -> 14714.78s]  my mojo he seemed like the strong silent type and you're cute enough that it intimidates me
[14714.78s -> 14720.52s]  just a little please you gotta help me practice for my big date i need a boost of confidence
[14720.52s -> 14730.02s]  and i need it now yay i mean uh cool thanks karen arranged it all with my date
