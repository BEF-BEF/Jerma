[0.82s -> 11.18s]  Yes, yes, really. Yeah, I know I told you that it probably wasn't gonna happen today, but I'm full of surprises, aren't I?
[11.18s -> 26.62s]  Hi guys. Uh, yeah, we're gonna try. There's been some strange happenings over the last few days, and I'm not gonna stream just yet.
[26.62s -> 32.92s]  I'm gonna make sure this is gonna work. So we're gonna hang out here for like five to ten minutes and see what happens.
[32.92s -> 43.30s]  If we're still green, like solid green, uh, heck yeah. Sounds like a plan. Telephone hangout stream.
[43.30s -> 50.12s]  No, I actually have something that I've been really looking forward to playing, but we're not gonna show that yet.
[50.12s -> 56.12s]  It's the title, it's in the stream title. Why do I think there's some type of curtain I can drop here?
[56.12s -> 62.42s]  Well, I'm not gonna tell you what the game is, I'm gonna make it be a surprise. It's the title of the stream and it's the game category.
[62.42s -> 77.35s]  But, just make sure we got it. Yeah, we're good. Is it Resident Evil? No, it is. Oh, maybe some of you guys haven't refreshed.
[77.35s -> 89.96s]  Would you look at that? Looks like some of you guys might not have refreshed. Is it Bookworm Adventures? No.
[89.96s -> 105.29s]  It is Africa. The game Africa. This is a rare PlayStation 3 game. Let's hope it's worth the $50 I spent on it.
[105.29s -> 116.21s]  Because it's rare. That doesn't mean good, but okay. We're gonna be playing a rare one tonight.
[116.21s -> 120.64s]  Yeah, I'll give you a quick little sneak peek. How does that sound? Getting down, look at that.
[120.64s -> 131.16s]  Okay, back to the intro. Oops. Well, now it's, now it's just playing, isn't it? I probably should turn that off.
[131.16s -> 141.95s]  Uh, this is a game where you take photos. That's the whole game. It's Pokemon Snap, but real life. It's a real life Pokemon Snap.
[141.95s -> 152.29s]  You gotta get perfect angles. And this is the game we're gonna play today.
[152.29s -> 161.95s]  Uh, because I don't want to start the vibe. And I know what some of you were thinking. That I'm, I'm Pikachu socks-ing everybody here.
[161.95s -> 168.95s]  And that I'm a liar, and I don't, let me just go, let me make sure, like, we're gonna see lots of Pogchamps in the chat, because this is like a year in the making.
[168.95s -> 178.86s]  I, I finally own this. Just so people understand. That this is not a Pikachu sock scenario.
[178.86s -> 186.80s]  There it is. There's the vibe. It's real. I didn't make this out of, like, plastic and cardboard and shit. I mean, I could've, it's real.
[186.80s -> 192.80s]  It's here. It's so, it's set up. And, uh, that's what I thought I was gonna be doing over the, like, the next three, four days.
[192.80s -> 205.33s]  Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Internet was all fucked up. We had a lot of issues. Uh, and I'm gonna give Cox the benefit of the doubt on this one.
[206.33s -> 214.51s]  I know, I hate to say that. But the weather here has been fucking crazy. We've been getting, like, 60 plus mile per hour winds.
[214.51s -> 222.51s]  Uh, like enough to take trees down and stuff. And it's been record rainfall. We had a shitload of rain.
[222.51s -> 234.68s]  So I, I, I, maybe the, the anger was misdirected. Potentially. I don't know. We have not dropped a single frame yet today.
[234.68s -> 242.68s]  Uh, there was a weird bandwidth problem me and Italics were having. So me and Italics are trying to work through these weird issues that we keep having with this company.
[242.68s -> 249.68s]  But, uh, I don't see any dropped frames at all in about five minutes. So I think I can stop stalling.
[249.68s -> 260.70s]  I don't know. Should I? Should I make a tweet and say that the stream is on? I think, I don't wanna jinx it.
[260.70s -> 272.67s]  Because the last stream from this place, uh, was actually Italics. And that was, like, what, two days ago? And he dropped, like, 30, 40,000 frames.
[272.67s -> 282.75s]  So, look, I, I don't wanna jinx it. But, you know, let's go. I've been wanting to stream for, like, three days.
[282.75s -> 290.88s]  I've got so much shit you guys have no idea. We've got Africa. The whole continent is here. In my house.
[290.88s -> 298.89s]  We got all the vive shit. This room is, this room is vivified. I vived it two days ago.
[298.89s -> 306.40s]  We got Space Channel 5 Part 1. We got, I bought a shitload more PlayStation 2 games. I'm ready to go.
[306.40s -> 313.47s]  And I gotta get out of here. So I'll see you tomorrow. No. All right. Let me just make a tweet. Then we can play, uh, Africa.
[313.47s -> 319.99s]  Metro Exodus just released. But I didn't play Last Light. I can't just play Exodus.
[321.29s -> 327.29s]  You can't watch Star Wars Episode 4 and then skip to Episode 6 if you've never seen them before.
[327.29s -> 330.60s]  They would be like, why would you do that? You have so many questions.
[330.60s -> 341.34s]  All right. I think we're good to go. Oh, boy. The whip dis- I got some good news for the house here today.
[341.34s -> 349.16s]  No drop frames in five minutes? That is beyond recognizable to us recently. Let me see here.
[349.16s -> 355.84s]  Because it was fucking bright red like an hour ago. This is weird. What a fucking weird technology.
[355.84s -> 363.69s]  All right. But I was told it was going to get fixed today. That's what I was told.
[363.69s -> 371.83s]  Anyway, let's go ahead and tweet that. I'll go ahead and get this off so you can take a look at this fun intro with like the lizard.
[371.83s -> 382.94s]  I think the stalling can end. You need audio too, don't you? You'll get it in a second.
[382.94s -> 395.07s]  So if you end up hearing, which you probably will, there's probably going to be a scenario where it sounds like my house is going to fall over because of the wind.
[395.07s -> 402.31s]  It's supposed to keep going over into midnight tonight. So you will hear like my room is being microwaved.
[402.31s -> 409.94s]  That's the sound it makes. That's the only way it can compare it to. There it is.
[409.94s -> 426.12s]  All right. I just tweeted it. That means it's real. Let's go. Get that audio on. I turned it on right when it stopped.
[426.12s -> 433.31s]  All right. We need to test something here. How are there already seven clips of this spring?
[433.31s -> 439.56s]  Did somebody, did you accidentally press the clip it button and you're like, oh shit, hopefully nobody saw that.
[439.56s -> 446.87s]  All right. Let's make sure that's synced up. All we can do is new game. So new game.
[446.87s -> 458.00s]  And there's the MGM lion. We are currently auto saving. Again, if you're just joining us.
[458.00s -> 464.00s]  This is the rarest PlayStation 3 game that exists in North America. It was five hundred dollars.
[464.00s -> 495.09s]  So, I mean, hopefully we get to play it. Is that the real win? What's going on here?
[495.09s -> 499.84s]  Do I have to like reset this game? I thought you're never supposed to do this.
[499.84s -> 503.84s]  Aren't you not supposed to ever do this with ever got any console ever?
[503.84s -> 516.60s]  I can't turn the console off. That's the number one cardinal sin is turning off your console during a save.
[516.60s -> 521.28s]  And this is like italics. Let me borrow this. I'm going to break his PlayStation 3.
[521.28s -> 529.60s]  What am I going to do about this? What if I like wipe? What if he's got some like saves on here that are really important?
[529.60s -> 536.36s]  I just looked it up. It's fifty dollars for a used copy. Yes, it is.
[536.36s -> 553.57s]  I don't. What's wrong with this? The disk is perfect. The disk is perfect.
[553.57s -> 563.15s]  This is not even. This is almost like factory new. Now, something just fucked up there.
[563.15s -> 577.33s]  Was there like a glitch? We're good. We're good. Everybody calmed down. Let's try it again.
[577.33s -> 589.29s]  It's broken and not used. He's actually microwaving his room. Somebody microwaved the room.
[589.29s -> 593.66s]  I don't know. Somebody went on to, you know, you know, every room has a fucking panel.
[593.66s -> 598.72s]  Every microwave. I don't know what I meant to say is every microwave has the panel.
[598.72s -> 604.81s]  Somebody put on like five seconds and impressed it. Let's try again.
[604.81s -> 643.66s]  Well, the Internet works in that spectacular. OK, told you I told you I wasn't supposed to do that.
[643.66s -> 646.66s]  Don't tell them. Don't tell them. Let me be the one that tells them.
[646.66s -> 659.63s]  Let me be the one that tells them. Let me be the one that tells them.
[659.63s -> 663.63s]  I can't fucking believe it. I just wanted to play Africa and take photos.
[663.63s -> 679.37s]  What did I do? What happened? How do I even do that? How do I delete that?
[679.37s -> 699.70s]  How do you delete save data? He's watching. I don't understand what happened.
[699.70s -> 716.85s]  I'm going to delete the save data for. OK, that's good. Let's let's hold on.
[716.85s -> 734.32s]  I'm going to do it again and see what happens. I'm so like sad right now.
[734.32s -> 739.88s]  I didn't even do anything. I just put a game disc in the PlayStation.
[739.88s -> 745.84s]  That didn't. I don't think that did. No, don't worry.
[745.84s -> 757.01s]  It didn't delete everything. It didn't delete everything. It only deleted Africa. I hope.
[757.01s -> 762.36s]  Do not see. That's what I'm telling you guys.
[762.36s -> 764.36s]  Everyone was telling me that I should have done that.
[764.36s -> 770.56s]  Fucking autosave. When is I going to come up with an autosave that doesn't fucking brick your entire...
[770.56s -> 776.47s]  Let's do it. Do it. Let's go. Autosave. Party the fuck up.
[776.47s -> 786.04s]  What is what is happening right now? I'm going to leave it for a second.
[786.04s -> 796.71s]  I'm impatient. It shouldn't take this long. Just wait. Just wait. OK.
[796.71s -> 815.27s]  I'm an impatient boomer. I don't know, man. After after two to three straight minutes.
[815.27s -> 823.27s]  It might have to delete all the local content. No, I can't do that.
[823.27s -> 835.77s]  OK. It takes a long time to load a whole continent.
[835.77s -> 843.45s]  I'm going to give this another two minutes. I just got to wipe his hard drive.
[843.45s -> 864.52s]  Try unplugging it now. If I have to factory reset his PlayStation.
[864.52s -> 868.85s]  What do you mean Google it? It takes that long. What?
[868.85s -> 875.93s]  Oh my God. So I brick this PS3 for no reason.
[875.93s -> 884.88s]  It has a three hundred and eighty seven megabyte save file.
[884.88s -> 889.57s]  Why does it have a four hundred meg save file?
[889.57s -> 898.04s]  OK. Well, sorry. It's Alex. I may have brick to your saves.
[898.04s -> 901.04s]  It's all right. You can make a new team as those character.
[901.04s -> 907.26s]  It's all right. Don't worry. I'm sorry. Music volume in midnight mode.
[907.26s -> 913.28s]  I don't have that. Can we get the Jurassic Park music down a little bit?
[913.28s -> 916.28s]  No, I'll keep it up. No, that's too much.
[916.28s -> 926.94s]  Two two ticks down. It is the look. How many times?
[926.94s -> 931.18s]  OK, thank God. It was going to be like five minutes every time.
[931.18s -> 933.18s]  This is an incredibly poorly optimized.
[933.18s -> 937.18s]  Learn all about Africa and its animals. All right.
[937.18s -> 941.93s]  Read about any animals you've discovered in Safari mode.
[941.93s -> 949.36s]  We're going to get default unlockables, which is bugs, shrimp and tigers.
[949.36s -> 961.87s]  So at least we'll have the defaults. So zebra.
[961.87s -> 967.00s]  I told you we're going to get those. Let's learn. Let's learn about the zebra.
[967.00s -> 970.00s]  This is the rarest PlayStation 3 game in North America.
[970.00s -> 974.31s]  This was five hundred dollars. You understand?
[974.31s -> 981.80s]  Let's go. A 3D view profile.
[981.80s -> 988.07s]  Look at this. There's even video. There's even.
[988.07s -> 991.50s]  Never mind. This 3D view.
[991.50s -> 999.91s]  That's what an adult looks like. What about a baby?
[999.91s -> 1002.91s]  I have not found the baby yet. We've got to take a picture of everything.
[1002.91s -> 1006.15s]  Planes or virtual zebras are Africa's most common zebra species.
[1006.15s -> 1009.15s]  They can be distinguished from other species by their unique pattern of stripes,
[1009.15s -> 1011.15s]  which are wide and widely spaced.
[1011.15s -> 1016.15s]  As in all zebra species, the stripes are thought to help visually distract potential predators.
[1016.15s -> 1022.54s]  So that's top right. That's what the zebra.
[1022.54s -> 1027.54s]  That's the male and female. I guess maybe the female stands up on two legs.
[1027.54s -> 1035.68s]  Interesting. Wears shoes too.
[1035.68s -> 1041.13s]  New record. Four to four and a half feet at the shoulder.
[1041.13s -> 1044.13s]  And they weigh four hundred eighty five to seven hundred seventy five.
[1044.13s -> 1048.40s]  Music's too loud. And we got fifty fucking subs just came in.
[1048.40s -> 1052.57s]  Fifty of them. That's right. Five hundred community subs.
[1052.57s -> 1055.57s]  What is going on? No. Oh my god. Fifty and then ten.
[1055.57s -> 1059.57s]  Great Canadian Fuck Club gave six thousand dollars worth of subs right there.
[1059.57s -> 1062.57s]  Whatever it was. Thank you so much, dude. That's a shitload.
[1062.57s -> 1069.03s]  Whiff whiffs. I gave ten. Great Canadians back.
[1069.03s -> 1076.03s]  All right. That's cool. I mean, no, but that is cool.
[1076.03s -> 1080.42s]  I'm talking about like the game. That's cool. This is cool.
[1080.42s -> 1088.93s]  That's a lot of fucking money. Fifty gifted subs is two, three.
[1088.93s -> 1092.93s]  That's two hundred and fifty bucks. My god.
[1092.93s -> 1095.81s]  Thanks for the three at all. It's cool. I guess.
[1095.81s -> 1103.38s]  And yes, I understand. I'm going real slow. It's been 20 minutes.
[1103.38s -> 1106.75s]  But I have to make sure that this Internet is going to work.
[1106.75s -> 1110.75s]  This is the rarest fucking PlayStation 3 game.
[1110.75s -> 1113.75s]  I ain't going to turn this on and get turned off in five seconds.
[1113.75s -> 1118.16s]  Ten community subs from Multi Trip. Thank you, Multi Trip.
[1118.16s -> 1127.59s]  Shut the fuck up about that shitty joke. It's not a joke.
[1127.59s -> 1133.22s]  Look it up. Go look it up.
[1133.22s -> 1140.26s]  Kairatobi, ten community subs. Thank you so much, Kairatobi.
[1140.26s -> 1145.91s]  That's like eighty community subs right now.
[1145.91s -> 1156.10s]  You guys are fucking incredible. All right, we're going to make our license here.
[1156.10s -> 1161.49s]  OK, let's see. Eric, age 27 from France.
[1161.49s -> 1165.49s]  Or Anna, 24 from the USA.
[1165.49s -> 1170.92s]  I mean, I can't. I mean, USA.
[1170.92s -> 1177.72s]  Occupation zoologist.
[1177.72s -> 1191.00s]  Journalist. I'm picking zoologist.
[1191.00s -> 1197.88s]  And USA. New name.
[1197.88s -> 1203.80s]  Anna, forty-six dollars.
[1203.80s -> 1208.48s]  It's not a joke. How about...
[1213.81s -> 1228.22s]  Photo. Focus.
[1228.22s -> 1232.22s]  Exposure. Exposure? No, no, no, no.
[1232.22s -> 1236.83s]  Focus. Lens.
[1236.83s -> 1240.83s]  Laura Lens. No, that's like a fourth grade
[1240.83s -> 1243.83s]  ABC mouse character. No, no, no, no.
[1243.83s -> 1249.14s]  Telephoto. Tele...
[1249.14s -> 1254.52s]  Telephana. Telephana. Telephana.
[1254.52s -> 1260.55s]  Aperture. That's pretty good. Telephana.
[1260.55s -> 1267.84s]  Aperture Anna. No, but that's like Aperture Science.
[1267.84s -> 1278.98s]  Tele... Laura, ten community subs from
[1278.98s -> 1282.98s]  Winterly Parsley. Winterly Parsley, thank you so much for ten subs.
[1282.98s -> 1290.40s]  Thank you. God damn it, there's so many different
[1290.40s -> 1294.40s]  interesting names. I like Laura... I don't care. Lens Laura.
[1294.40s -> 1300.06s]  Laura through the lens or something. I don't know.
[1300.06s -> 1308.72s]  Laura Long Lens. That's a bad name, bad name, bad name.
[1308.72s -> 1317.66s]  Streamer's not reading chat. Yes, he is.
[1317.66s -> 1325.04s]  No, I'm not gonna... I'm gonna name this character something
[1325.04s -> 1329.04s]  because this character is, believe it or not, and whatever everybody wants to say, this character will be
[1329.04s -> 1333.04s]  in the next Jerma Rumble. It's important. Every new
[1333.04s -> 1337.04s]  protagonist that you get in a video game, this character's gonna be in the Jerma Rumble. Has to be.
[1337.04s -> 1348.62s]  What was that one? Anna Exposure. No.
[1348.62s -> 1354.72s]  This is taking too long.
[1354.72s -> 1360.49s]  Aperture Anna. What does Aperture mean? Focus.
[1360.49s -> 1366.96s]  Whose name starts with F? Fran? Fran Focus.
[1366.96s -> 1373.04s]  Fran Focus. I'm done. How do I do uppercase on this computer?
[1373.04s -> 1380.27s]  Francine Focus. Yep. Done.
[1380.27s -> 1396.76s]  There it is. Francine Focus. How do I go?
[1396.76s -> 1406.75s]  How do I make a space? Can I not do a space?
[1406.75s -> 1429.02s]  That's the maximum name you can have. Okay.
[1429.02s -> 1435.76s]  That's Francine. That's fine. Francine Focus.
[1435.76s -> 1444.20s]  Look at how beautiful this game is. You didn't want me to play it. You.
[1444.20s -> 1448.20s]  A245 Fortnite. That guy didn't want me to fucking
[1448.20s -> 1464.64s]  play. Get him out of here. What? Oh.
[1464.64s -> 1468.64s]  I thought that was me. We finally arrived at the Manyanga Conservation Area.
[1468.64s -> 1473.13s]  Okay. Base camp is all set up, so let's start exploring
[1473.13s -> 1477.13s]  right away. The game gets it. Who wants to do a tutorial? Who wants to learn everything?
[1477.13s -> 1481.37s]  Just get us out there into the wild and get the camera in my hands.
[1481.37s -> 1485.37s]  Looking forward to working with you, Francine. You too, Eric.
[1485.37s -> 1489.37s]  The Jambo Navi interface is all set up on the laptop.
[1489.37s -> 1493.37s]  There may be messages from the head office, so you should check your email now.
[1493.37s -> 1501.20s]  Just select the laptop PC to use it. Check email, transfer photos from your camera,
[1501.20s -> 1508.43s]  purchase equipment, and more? Okay. Got email, photo,
[1508.43s -> 1512.73s]  gallery, shopping, save. Let's go ahead and get that
[1512.73s -> 1521.20s]  out of the way so we don't corrupt it. 387 megabytes.
[1521.20s -> 1531.31s]  Is this going to take that long to save it every time?
[1531.31s -> 1545.02s]  It's going to take like two minutes to save every time. That's
[1545.02s -> 1549.32s]  insane. Did they just copy and paste the whole game in a save state?
[1549.32s -> 1554.76s]  That might be what this is. Is this game more than 400 meg?
[1554.76s -> 1567.00s]  It's 10 years ago. That's not counting photos. So once I start
[1567.00s -> 1571.00s]  having like 50 to 100 photos in my library, this is going to be like 5 gig.
[1571.00s -> 1582.48s]  Saving is going to take like an hour. This is probably why nobody owns it.
[1582.48s -> 1591.56s]  Maybe. Alright, let's check the email. When your in-game
[1591.56s -> 1595.56s]  email, pretend email, is faster than your save,
[1595.56s -> 1599.56s]  there's something wrong. You could have made that a little longer. Important wildlife research
[1599.56s -> 1604.00s]  request. Welcome to the Manyanga Conservation Area. If you
[1604.00s -> 1608.00s]  are the first to research Manyanga, so we need you to start by documenting
[1608.00s -> 1612.00s]  the animals that live here. Anytime you see a new animal, take a picture of it
[1612.00s -> 1616.00s]  and send it by replying to this email. Then we can send you
[1616.00s -> 1626.04s]  new photo assignments for that animal. Bits? We got big bits?
[1626.04s -> 1634.81s]  Holy shit, we did have big bits. A hundred dollars.
[1634.81s -> 1641.87s]  Thank you for the hundred bucks. G-Y-H-D-H-F-E.
[1641.87s -> 1645.87s]  Based on your responses to my questions, I've determined that you
[1645.87s -> 1649.87s]  would be impotent, asexual or answers of a
[1649.87s -> 1653.87s]  beta male. Also, your responses on my fetish question, I've determined
[1653.87s -> 1657.87s]  you to be a person with really fucked up fetishes because if a person doesn't express his fetishes
[1657.87s -> 1661.87s]  online, he's really fucked up and he can't reveal. This is way out of all of this
[1661.87s -> 1665.87s]  however you have to answer this question or else it's a valid place to. Have you tried? I'm not going to read that out loud.
[1665.87s -> 1670.94s]  Okay, I got two things
[1670.94s -> 1674.94s]  to ask you there. Two questions. I got a question for
[1674.94s -> 1678.94s]  you. Here's question number- let's get this out of the way. Question
[1678.94s -> 1684.59s]  number one for you. Why do you care so much about my sexuality?
[1684.59s -> 1688.59s]  Isn't that my business? You know what I mean? Ain't that like my business?
[1688.59s -> 1694.73s]  You know what I'm saying? Question number two for you. Equally
[1694.73s -> 1710.35s]  is important. No, it is ours. What?
[1710.35s -> 1714.35s]  I'm in a very happy relationship with
[1714.35s -> 1718.35s]  someone named Kim. She's my girlfriend.
[1718.35s -> 1728.78s]  Got a healthy relationship. That's all you need to know.
[1728.78s -> 1732.78s]  I'm not going to answer the question at the end of that because that's not appropriate
[1732.78s -> 1736.78s]  for me to say on a live stream of me taking pictures of animals
[1736.78s -> 1741.40s]  in Africa. Okay? If this was like a
[1741.40s -> 1745.40s]  podcast- let's talk about appropriate shit here. If I was doing a podcast
[1745.40s -> 1750.16s]  about sexual shit
[1750.16s -> 1757.79s]  alright, yeah, but I'm about to take a picture of a zebra. What is the
[1757.79s -> 1766.57s]  context of this conversation? We can't even get to the animals at this
[1766.57s -> 1776.56s]  rate. Anyways, no, you can't just like
[1776.56s -> 1780.56s]  alright, I'm going to make one more point here. You can't- okay,
[1780.56s -> 1784.56s]  if someone's coming out of a coffee shop, let's say Brad Pitt
[1784.56s -> 1788.56s]  was coming out of a coffee shop, right? Yeah, it's Brad Pitt.
[1788.56s -> 1792.56s]  You know him, you've seen his movies. And you run up to Brad Pitt
[1792.56s -> 1796.56s]  there's a bunch of people taking pictures of him and he's like
[1796.56s -> 1800.56s]  oh no, no photos today please. I've got pictures of zebras to take.
[1800.56s -> 1804.56s]  And they're like, okay, yeah, you run fucking through the crowd
[1804.56s -> 1808.56s]  and you like run in there and you're like, hey, have you ever tried to
[1808.56s -> 1814.76s]  blank your own blank? He's going to be like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[1814.76s -> 1829.29s]  He's going to be like, is he going to walk away?
[1829.29s -> 1834.24s]  Comparing yourself to Brad Pitt. I mean, this is 3,300 people here.
[1834.24s -> 1840.40s]  How many people have seen Brad Pitt's movies? Maybe like
[1840.40s -> 1844.40s]  5-10,000? He gets like 5-10,000 concurrent viewers on his movies.
[1844.40s -> 1854.84s]  I think I'm in like a similar category, I think. Thank you for the 100 bucks
[1854.84s -> 1861.63s]  though. Alright, we had 50 fucking dollars
[1861.63s -> 1870.09s]  from ChunkyBeloney. ChunkyBeloney thanks for $50.02.
[1870.09s -> 1874.09s]  Here's a nice cheer to get the taste of the last one out of your mouth. Happy Friday. You've been streaming
[1874.09s -> 1878.09s]  for 30 minutes and managed to save and name your character.
[1878.09s -> 1885.98s]  This is the ultimate stall stream. Don't you
[1885.98s -> 1889.98s]  understand? Things that Jerma says
[1889.98s -> 1893.98s]  500 times a stream. Don't you understand? This is something you gotta understand.
[1893.98s -> 1902.19s]  You understand? This is something you guys gotta understand. Okay.
[1902.19s -> 1908.97s]  No, seriously, thank you both of you. 150 bucks. I need to take a picture
[1908.97s -> 1912.97s]  of a, what am I taking a picture of? I'm going to get 3,000 concurrent
[1912.97s -> 1919.26s]  viewers. I already have that. Alright, I, I, I, let's go.
[1919.26s -> 1923.26s]  Take a picture of it and send, anytime you see a new animal, take a picture of it and send it to my email.
[1923.26s -> 1930.49s]  You got it. So difficulty is
[1930.49s -> 1934.49s]  level one. Just get, let's go. Let's go take some photos. Let's go.
[1934.49s -> 1940.08s]  A draw request already came in, did it? Just start by taking a picture of each type of animal
[1940.08s -> 1944.25s]  that you see. Francine, this is for you. A
[1944.25s -> 1950.59s]  Tsetse type F. It's my first camera.
[1950.59s -> 1955.71s]  And binoculars. And a GPS map. The camera case is
[1955.71s -> 1962.62s]  over there. F for Francine. I put the tools in the
[1962.62s -> 1966.99s]  cases next to the bookshelf. I'd like to go too, but I need to sort out
[1966.99s -> 1970.99s]  our equipment. Can you go with the guide, James?
[1970.99s -> 1975.48s]  He should be waiting just outside. Oh, the guy's name is James. I was like, what the hell are you talking about?
[1975.48s -> 1980.80s]  Have a safe trip. Okay. So let's go into the camera case.
[1980.80s -> 1985.47s]  Make sure that's equipped. Yep, view cameras and lenses. We've got
[1985.47s -> 1990.54s]  the type F. Body is type F, that's all I got. There's multiple
[1990.54s -> 1998.22s]  bodies, multiple lenses. I don't think I can do anything else.
[1998.22s -> 2002.65s]  New tools, they're already equipped. Yep, binoculars, GPS map. Use with the
[2002.65s -> 2007.21s]  R1 button. Use with select. Good thing I looked at that, otherwise I would have been
[2007.21s -> 2014.46s]  like, don't even explain our flight. Exit base camp.
[2014.46s -> 2028.04s]  Tsetse. Tsetse. It's your birthday today.
[2028.04s -> 2040.06s]  You know it's on the way. We should be way
[2040.06s -> 2044.06s]  more excited about something else. Zero drop frames.
[2044.06s -> 2050.12s]  Maybe they fixed it. I don't know, I'm not going to be... I can't say that's
[2050.12s -> 2058.32s]  going to happen. We're at Duma Step. Okay.
[2058.32s -> 2062.32s]  Jumbo Francine. Welcome to the Manyanga Conservation Area.
[2062.32s -> 2066.32s]  I'll drive the car, Francine. Go ahead and make yourself comfortable in the backseat.
[2066.32s -> 2073.42s]  I have to take pictures of animals, right? We're going to get like a monster
[2073.42s -> 2079.45s]  hunter now. Where's the...
[2079.45s -> 2083.45s]  The Kulu Yaku?
[2083.45s -> 2088.08s]  What's the bird's name? The bird with the egg? Hippo Pool.
[2088.08s -> 2097.10s]  This is the Hippo Pool. Yeah, well I would have driven
[2097.10s -> 2102.30s]  another like five feet up there. Nobody is home right now, but Hippo's
[2102.30s -> 2106.67s]  off and bathe here. Yeah, I know that. I've played the game before. Drive.
[2106.67s -> 2110.67s]  Wrong way. Wrong way, idiot. Like fucking idiot. Doesn't even know where he's going.
[2110.67s -> 2119.95s]  You know I've done this before. You know that? Hello? You know I've
[2119.95s -> 2128.22s]  done this. I drive over here. You're going the wrong way. Just turn around.
[2128.22s -> 2132.91s]  Wow, you like went into the ditch for a second. What a fucking idiot.
[2132.91s -> 2138.49s]  God, how does this person have 3,000 viewers? I don't understand. Am I supposed to be
[2138.49s -> 2146.25s]  taking pictures? How do I take pictures? How do I take
[2146.25s -> 2150.43s]  a photo? Is this just like teaching you that they are okay? Here we go. Not many animals here.
[2150.43s -> 2154.43s]  There's a shitload of animals here. That bird's coming down and swooping down and going to get us.
[2154.43s -> 2159.82s]  Let's try a Wily Oasis. When there's water, there's life,
[2159.82s -> 2166.04s]  right? Blind. There are no animals. Wow,
[2166.04s -> 2170.04s]  a blind streamer. Can't even see the fucking animal in front of him. He's pretending.
[2170.04s -> 2176.33s]  He has to be. Yeah, I don't know man. Like seriously? Like how do you
[2176.33s -> 2180.33s]  not see that? There were clearly three or four deer in front of him and he just doesn't see
[2180.33s -> 2184.83s]  them? I just don't get it. He needs to start paying the fuck attention to stuff. It's pissing
[2184.83s -> 2195.85s]  me off lately. That's the Wily Oasis. Yeah.
[2195.85s -> 2206.67s]  Just like I said, plenty of animals here. Oh, let's get a giraffe. Too far
[2206.67s -> 2210.67s]  to see? Try the binoculars. Press R1 button to use the binoculars.
[2210.67s -> 2217.53s]  Oh, whoops. It could get a bit bumpy, so hang on. Oh, I can't wait to see how
[2217.53s -> 2223.44s]  badly he drives. Come on, streamer. He actually just
[2223.44s -> 2230.68s]  has to dash into that. Alright, we can find the perfect one. Look at that. Planes, zebras.
[2230.68s -> 2236.52s]  I would laugh my ass off if he fucking runs into one. Look, they're
[2236.52s -> 2246.38s]  what? What about the giraffe? Look at that.
[2246.38s -> 2252.67s]  Maasai giraffes. Yeah, it was also, what's this one?
[2252.67s -> 2260.16s]  The little ones. Wily Oasis.
[2260.16s -> 2267.90s]  By the way, Francine, do you know how to use the camera? I have
[2267.90s -> 2272.52s]  no idea. Press the square button to point the camera and press the circle
[2272.52s -> 2276.52s]  button or R1 to shoot. This one right to the right is looking like
[2276.52s -> 2280.52s]  prime picture material. They're right in front of the bush.
[2280.52s -> 2289.29s]  Why don't you try it out now? Point the camera and then snap a picture. How do I zoom in?
[2289.29s -> 2310.14s]  No, that's not good enough. Where's the truck? Where's the truck?
[2310.14s -> 2317.63s]  Okay, I don't know where the truck went. Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it.
[2317.63s -> 2326.78s]  Check your photos in the field menu. Press the triangle button to open the
[2326.78s -> 2334.40s]  field menu. Photos. That one's, look at how beautiful that is.
[2334.40s -> 2338.89s]  A little blurry, but it's alright. That's a pretty good
[2338.89s -> 2344.60s]  calendar photo, I would say. Tools, missions, look like I could.
[2344.60s -> 2348.60s]  Try taking some pictures up close. Press X button to exit the car. But please don't
[2348.60s -> 2353.93s]  stray too far from the car. Good luck. Snapshots of plenty of animals.
[2353.93s -> 2359.07s]  You're not gonna like leave me, are you? I can actually walk around?
[2359.07s -> 2387.72s]  How did that one come up? That zebra.
[2387.72s -> 2399.44s]  Okay, uh, what if I just took like a fucking... Oh, come on!
[2399.44s -> 2403.80s]  I pressed the wrong button. Come on, do something, do it again.
[2403.80s -> 2418.59s]  No, I gotta take pictures of like animals. No, you scare them if you get too... Okay,
[2418.59s -> 2423.92s]  I got zebras, I need giraffe. Is it like a sneak button? What's like
[2423.92s -> 2427.92s]  the stealth kill button? And I don't mean like the stealth kill button, I mean like the stealth
[2427.92s -> 2431.92s]  button that makes you creep down and do the... Like, hold on, just quiet.
[2431.92s -> 2442.41s]  There's one right here. No, I gotta get closer than that. God damn it.
[2442.41s -> 2452.73s]  What are those little guys called? Francine, don't wander too far, it's dangerous.
[2452.73s -> 2458.36s]  Can I get like fucking eaten by a lion? Come on, come on!
[2458.36s -> 2474.16s]  That was the wrong button. It's circle.
[2474.16s -> 2486.32s]  I keep thinking it's X. Okay, there's the giraffe.
[2486.32s -> 2498.24s]  Get one close. I mean, I can't get that close to a giraffe, guys. Not bad.
[2498.24s -> 2505.15s]  I gotta get the little ones. There they are. Okay, let's get up there.
[2505.15s -> 2509.71s]  Right next to this tree. Can I get it? Come on. I gotta get away.
[2509.71s -> 2518.62s]  Don't run away! Stop! Ah! Here we go. It's gonna be patient.
[2518.62s -> 2525.34s]  You're gonna pop up from behind the bush. Beautiful. Oh,
[2525.34s -> 2534.38s]  excellent job. That's it. Tutorial mission passed.
[2534.38s -> 2544.12s]  You have to crouch to enter sneak mode. Oh, I don't know how to crouch. No.
[2544.12s -> 2553.29s]  Wasted film. Baby giraffe look like adult giraffe, but just get the
[2553.29s -> 2562.96s]  rhino. Where's the rhino? I gotta get back in the car
[2562.96s -> 2583.95s]  to get the rhino. What about that? Is that a zebra? Yeah.
[2583.95s -> 2591.00s]  That's great that they actually pose, though. Let's go back to base camp. Let's review the photos
[2591.00s -> 2598.19s]  and do the tutorial. I might get a couple of action shots here. This might be good.
[2598.19s -> 2611.56s]  Where's the rhino? Looking for a rhino? Come on. Something crazy is gonna happen.
[2611.56s -> 2620.28s]  He doesn't know where the rhino is. I'll get the rhino eventually.
[2620.28s -> 2626.96s]  I'm not operating the car. Maybe I get to drive the car eventually. I would assume. Probably can, right?
[2626.96s -> 2636.36s]  What are those? Lining the shot up?
[2636.36s -> 2644.81s]  Are those just regular horses? What are those?
[2644.81s -> 2660.60s]  Got ya. Gazelles. Horses. I don't know.
[2660.60s -> 2668.68s]  How far away? You couldn't even tell. This is an on-rail shooter.
[2668.68s -> 2672.68s]  Well, only for this portion. You actually get to get out.
[2672.68s -> 2685.10s]  Let's review those photos. Send them pictures of the gas tanks.
[2685.10s -> 2692.41s]  How was the safari today? Many types of animals live in the area. Good luck tomorrow, too.
[2692.41s -> 2696.97s]  There are like 500 animals to take pictures of in this game.
[2696.97s -> 2705.05s]  How was it on the field? Find lots of animals? Transfer your photos to JumboNavi.
[2705.05s -> 2709.05s]  Also, send the head office a photo of each animal that you took by replying to their email.
[2709.05s -> 2718.01s]  Transfer photos.
[2718.01s -> 2731.07s]  I have to check the ones that I want to send.
[2731.07s -> 2736.64s]  Let's take a look at the view. That one's not bad. I like that one.
[2736.64s -> 2740.64s]  That one's way better.
[2740.64s -> 2745.58s]  That's just a handsome fella, you know what I mean?
[2745.58s -> 2756.25s]  This one... no. Wait, what was it? This is so bad.
[2756.25s -> 2760.25s]  This is like Grandma with an iPhone. At the Disney one.
[2760.25s -> 2768.06s]  I like that one. Good picture, Grandma. This is like in your group chat.
[2768.06s -> 2774.52s]  Everybody has one with their family.
[2774.52s -> 2778.52s]  And even when you say hide notifications, it doesn't matter. It still pops up.
[2778.52s -> 2786.35s]  At the top of your phone. You have to kind of chime in.
[2786.35s -> 2790.35s]  Your grandma's in there, so you're going to be like, oh, that's a really cool picture you got there of the turkey.
[2790.35s -> 2794.35s]  Yeah, I was at the safari at Disney World.
[2794.35s -> 2798.35s]  Let me show you this photo.
[2798.35s -> 2802.35s]  You can be on National Geographic with those photos.
[2802.35s -> 2815.23s]  That's how it goes every time.
[2815.23s -> 2820.88s]  I'm going to take this one. Here's the one I wanted to use. That's a cool zebra.
[2820.88s -> 2827.87s]  Let's transfer those.
[2827.87s -> 2844.24s]  Did I just delete everything?
[2844.24s -> 2849.24s]  This is spaced with photos.
[2849.24s -> 2857.18s]  I can save them?
[2857.18s -> 2864.22s]  We got reply. Send photos.
[2864.22s -> 2868.65s]  Did I even pick photos? Oh, here we go.
[2868.65s -> 2872.89s]  This is the good one I wanted. Send that one.
[2872.89s -> 2879.32s]  Send. Result. Clear.
[2879.32s -> 2883.32s]  Good angle. Excellent target. Marvelous distance and marvelous technique.
[2883.32s -> 2889.42s]  $3,000. Animal added to GeoAfrica mode.
[2889.42s -> 2896.51s]  Thompson's gazelle.
[2896.51s -> 2900.88s]  I'm going to send you a picture of the giraffe.
[2900.88s -> 2909.34s]  It's a bad angle, but it's okay. I'm going to use it.
[2909.34s -> 2914.28s]  Great angle. Marvelous. Marvelous. Excellent.
[2914.28s -> 2925.37s]  Look at all the space above the giraffe. This is a bad picture.
[2925.37s -> 2933.10s]  Let's do it again.
[2933.10s -> 2938.04s]  What if I just send him a picture of my friend giving the thumbs up?
[2938.04s -> 2943.69s]  What's he going to do?
[2943.69s -> 2956.43s]  This photo. Let's see what they say.
[2956.43s -> 2963.10s]  Failed. Sorry.
[2963.10s -> 2967.10s]  This bird or this bird? This one's probably more clear.
[2967.10s -> 2973.12s]  Even though it's not at all.
[2973.12s -> 2979.45s]  It is a pretty bad angle, but at least I cleared it with a B.
[2979.45s -> 2986.11s]  Lapid-faced vulture.
[2986.11s -> 2991.42s]  Let's do the new animal.
[2991.42s -> 2996.11s]  What is this of? I don't think I even did the zebras.
[2996.11s -> 3004.30s]  Excellent angle. Marvelous. Marvelous. Marvelous.
[3004.30s -> 3011.68s]  I already did it. So what did I not send?
[3011.68s -> 3024.43s]  The other gazelles. Like these. Bad angle.
[3024.43s -> 3030.83s]  How do you have good distance?
[3030.83s -> 3039.92s]  There's another iPad picture. I have money.
[3039.92s -> 3045.10s]  I'm going to go on my photo gallery. I'm going to start deleting shit.
[3045.10s -> 3049.10s]  Delete this. Delete. Delete. Delete. Wait. Keep that one.
[3049.10s -> 3060.36s]  I think we already got them. We got them all.
[3060.36s -> 3064.36s]  Maybe I can get a better angle on Turkey. Whatever the hell this thing is.
[3064.36s -> 3069.95s]  Because that is a vulture too, right? Maybe I'll get a better grade.
[3069.95s -> 3086.20s]  We improved the grade. Let's see what the save is now.
[3086.20s -> 3091.40s]  308. I have to do it. No we don't. Not yet.
[3091.40s -> 3098.32s]  What do I have for money? Photo frame. Photo storage.
[3098.32s -> 3102.32s]  That's all I have unlocked right now. $48,000
[3102.32s -> 3106.75s]  for a photo storage device. $68,000 for a photo frame.
[3106.75s -> 3112.76s]  That's kind of ridiculous.
[3112.76s -> 3116.76s]  Transfer photos to laptop PC to free up space on your camera.
[3116.76s -> 3121.20s]  As long as there's room your photos will be automatically transferred when you use the PC.
[3121.20s -> 3125.20s]  By the way, I prepared a map of the area. We can fill the map out as we discover new areas.
[3125.20s -> 3129.44s]  Great first day out there. Let's rest up and get an early start tomorrow.
[3129.44s -> 3144.92s]  Time for bed.
[3144.92s -> 3148.92s]  Oh, I'll leave the survey log on the bookshelf. You may want to review it from time to time.
[3148.92s -> 3154.38s]  What do you mean like right now?
[3158.38s -> 3162.38s]  The grandma joke in the group chat is going to be a reality.
[3162.38s -> 3169.50s]  Survey log. This is the log of the progress of the survey of the
[3169.50s -> 3174.38s]  Mannyanga conservation area.
[3176.38s -> 3183.69s]  Camera lingo. Camera shake. Basic photography.
[3183.69s -> 3189.60s]  Okay, remaining image. Make sure I know what this is going on. Left stick is angle.
[3189.60s -> 3195.76s]  Right stick up and down. Wait a minute.
[3195.76s -> 3200.44s]  Today's advice. If you think your photo is good, chances are it is.
[3200.44s -> 3205.84s]  Type F. We don't need to know about that. Camera shake.
[3205.84s -> 3209.84s]  Let's talk about a nasty little problem that can wreck your hard-won photos.
[3209.84s -> 3213.84s]  You guessed it. Camera shake. If your hands jiggle while you snap the picture, your photos are blurred.
[3213.84s -> 3218.08s]  Increase the shutter speed or try pressing the shutter
[3218.08s -> 3223.28s]  more gently. So that's why these pictures have been shitty.
[3223.28s -> 3228.57s]  Shooting vertically. What?
[3228.57s -> 3232.57s]  Vertical photos are fun to take. No they're not. This is like every
[3232.57s -> 3236.57s]  photographer will tell you that don't ever take a photo with your iPhone. Vertical.
[3236.57s -> 3241.26s]  I guess this is like a nice iPhone though. From the viewfinder, try holding
[3241.26s -> 3248.68s]  the controller in a vertical position.
[3248.68s -> 3254.33s]  I don't even know if I can do that with this controller.
[3254.33s -> 3259.28s]  Pictures you take are saved to your photo storage. All your photos go to the same storage.
[3259.28s -> 3266.20s]  So even if you change cameras, you'll have the same number of shots remaining.
[3266.20s -> 3270.20s]  Dirty shots in the storage. If you want to take more, you need to import some of your photos into the John Blanavia or
[3270.20s -> 3276.88s]  let's delete to clear up space.
[3276.88s -> 3284.51s]  My survey begins.
[3284.51s -> 3288.51s]  This is your player record. Total time played, day of survey, photos taken, missions cleared.
[3288.51s -> 3293.00s]  My ranking is Vervet Monkey.
[3293.00s -> 3297.50s]  This is going to be fun. Let's do it. How do I do anything?
[3297.50s -> 3303.15s]  Alright, Eric.
[3303.15s -> 3307.77s]  What about the map? The map of the locations you've explored.
[3307.77s -> 3315.60s]  Look at all this. Look at all that up there.
[3315.60s -> 3320.09s]  There's so much. I'm going to beat this whole game today.
[3320.09s -> 3324.09s]  Well no I'm not, but I'll play for a while. Hippo Pool Base Camp. We've got to go to the Hippo Pool, right?
[3324.09s -> 3328.91s]  Base Camp Hippo Pool. Closest water source from Base Camp.
[3328.91s -> 3333.40s]  Favorite spot for Hippopotamus. Hippopotamus is
[3333.40s -> 3338.67s]  a fucking dangerous though. They're the most vicious animal on Earth.
[3338.67s -> 3345.58s]  Alright, let's see. Any new emails? I do.
[3345.58s -> 3350.27s]  Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. Alright, research. Herd of...
[3350.27s -> 3354.44s]  We need a herd of gazelles. Hi Francie, nice to meet you.
[3354.44s -> 3358.44s]  Since you're doing research on the Duma step, I had a favor to ask you. Are you familiar with an animal called the
[3358.44s -> 3362.44s]  Thompson gazelle? They favor flat plains with a wide view and live in herds of several
[3362.44s -> 3366.44s]  dozen head or more. Could you photograph one of these herds for us so we can study
[3366.44s -> 3370.44s]  their behavior on the Duma step? By the way, I've attached a really good photo
[3370.44s -> 3374.44s]  and an amazing, in fact, video of a herd of them. But I'm just trying to
[3374.44s -> 3378.44s]  flex on you to see if you can even come remotely close to my incredible skill.
[3378.44s -> 3384.73s]  Thank you. Have a nice day. Okay, we need a...
[3384.73s -> 3388.73s]  Okay, let's take it. Accept this mission? Yes. Herd of gazelles.
[3388.73s -> 3395.64s]  Plains with a wide view. So we got that one. Can we do more than one?
[3395.64s -> 3402.19s]  This is the project head office. Thanks for that photo you sent to the Plains zebra.
[3402.19s -> 3406.19s]  Could we ask you to take another one with a little more detail? We want to study
[3406.19s -> 3410.19s]  the stripes on the Plains zebra's face. So we need a face shot taken
[3410.19s -> 3414.19s]  from head on. There's no rush, just send me one when you have time.
[3414.19s -> 3421.04s]  Yeah, like the one we just sent you. Good day Francie.
[3421.04s -> 3425.04s]  My name is Maliwe Essien. I'm researching savanna wildlife ecology.
[3425.04s -> 3429.04s]  I caught wind of your studies on the Duma step and was hoping I might ask you a favor.
[3429.04s -> 3433.04s]  I wish to teach my students how to identify a topi. But I need a
[3433.04s -> 3437.04s]  photograph first. Topis have a distinct black pattern
[3437.04s -> 3441.04s]  at the base of their legs. Could you take a picture from the side that shows this?
[3441.04s -> 3448.72s]  So this is just side missions. The Maasai giraffe photo you sent us the other day
[3448.72s -> 3452.72s]  was quite nice. You're already creating a buzz around the office. When we showed the photo
[3452.72s -> 3456.72s]  to a bottled water manufacturer, they expressed an interest in seeing a photo
[3456.72s -> 3460.72s]  of a giraffe drinking water. Can you manage this additional
[3460.72s -> 3465.85s]  request? Yeah? Alright, so what do we need?
[3465.85s -> 3469.85s]  Oh, I can only take one mission at a time. Alright, that one's better. Giraffe drinking
[3469.85s -> 3473.85s]  water. And then if I come across a zebra,
[3473.85s -> 3477.85s]  take a picture of its face, and we're looking for
[3477.85s -> 3482.28s]  different discolorations
[3482.28s -> 3486.28s]  on the topi with the legs.
[3486.28s -> 3490.28s]  Alright, photo of a giraffe drinking water.
[3490.28s -> 3495.16s]  And this is also just take pictures of any new animal. It's just permanently
[3495.16s -> 3501.77s]  there. Alright, let's go. Our next job is to photograph a Maasai giraffe drinking
[3501.77s -> 3505.77s]  water. When giraffes drink water, they spread their front legs and drink from a standing position.
[3505.77s -> 3510.27s]  Stay out of notice and wait for the giraffe to become thirsty.
[3510.27s -> 3526.60s]  Alright, stalk a giraffe. I can't wait to get a dangerous shot.
[3526.60s -> 3546.43s]  You know, it's just loading up all the photos. Yeah!
[3546.43s -> 3550.92s]  Alright, we'll be going James.
[3561.53s -> 3568.64s]  He just drives. Am I driving?
[3568.64s -> 3572.64s]  If you ever want me to stop the car, press the L2 button to tell me. For your own safety,
[3572.64s -> 3576.64s]  you can't get out of the car until it comes to a complete stop. It's none of that
[3576.64s -> 3581.32s]  GTA bullshit. Press the R2 button and I'll start driving again.
[3581.32s -> 3591.95s]  Press circle to talk to me. Please be sure not to wander too far
[3591.95s -> 3598.35s]  from the car. Alright, go! Alright, giraffe drinking
[3598.35s -> 3607.69s]  water. Alright, stop. We gotta get a picture of a hippo.
[3607.69s -> 3618.70s]  How close? Oh, he sees me. Is this like his aggression stance?
[3618.70s -> 3641.47s]  I can get closer, I think. Hippos can't run.
[3641.47s -> 3647.56s]  Can hippos... Wait, hold on. Can I die?
[3647.56s -> 3654.60s]  Hold on a minute. What does that mean?
[3654.60s -> 3661.72s]  He's like burping at me. Alright, I'm just gonna get it. We'll get all of them.
[3661.72s -> 3669.15s]  No, no, no. Wrong button. Why is it circled?
[3669.15s -> 3691.28s]  Wait, push it slightly, gently. Okay, let's go.
[3691.28s -> 3696.97s]  Let's get out of this way. Charge the hippo. I'm not gonna charge the hippo because
[3696.97s -> 3700.97s]  if I die and I have to reload a save, I haven't saved it in like an hour.
[3700.97s -> 3710.30s]  Let me save it. You're driving right towards the hippo.
[3710.30s -> 3714.30s]  Hey, look at that. See, the hippos are bathing at the hippo pool. It's a great chance
[3715.30s -> 3719.30s]  for some photos. Hippos can be dangerous. Be careful when taking close shots.
[3719.30s -> 3725.64s]  No, I already got it. Let's go. We don't want any hippos coming after us.
[3725.64s -> 3731.80s]  Let's take a detour. He just drove straight at him.
[3731.80s -> 3741.01s]  Hippos can run literally like a horse. Yeah, but
[3741.01s -> 3745.01s]  they're like a train. It takes them like a mile to slow down.
[3745.01s -> 3756.80s]  They're running with like five billion pounds. Why are you stopping?
[3756.80s -> 3762.52s]  Get us to a giraffe. Now. Isn't that even worse?
[3762.52s -> 3771.16s]  Isn't the hippo actually the most dangerous animal in the world?
[3771.16s -> 3780.69s]  Alright, stop, stop, stop, stop. Now, one of these giraffes
[3780.69s -> 3789.46s]  has to take a drink. Bingo. Get in there. Donk your head.
[3789.46s -> 3802.52s]  Let's... Okay, hold on. Hold on. No, no, no.
[3802.52s -> 3815.14s]  We could get a better one. Yeah, the level of detail loading with the frame rate
[3815.14s -> 3819.14s]  in the background. Well, yeah, it's to keep the CPU cool.
[3819.14s -> 3830.53s]  None of these animals are dangerous. I'll be fine. Come on, come on.
[3830.53s -> 3837.06s]  I gotta get in the magazine. No, I gotta get in the bottled water. Fuck.
[3837.06s -> 3845.32s]  Do it again. This is a great shot. Go down one more time.
[3845.32s -> 3852.16s]  This is good framing. I got the water, the distance.
[3852.16s -> 3862.66s]  What the hell was that? He just lifted his leg up to pee.
[3862.66s -> 3866.66s]  Oh, you asshole. We already... Alright, hold on. This will be good.
[3866.66s -> 3881.57s]  If I get two of them, that's gonna look great. Go into that water.
[3881.57s -> 3892.90s]  He's getting so close, dude. This is gonna be perfect. Look at that background, too.
[3892.90s -> 3899.64s]  That'll go on the front of a bottle of water. I can guarantee it.
[3899.64s -> 3915.76s]  Just in case, just in case. Hold on. I gotta get in the front of the zebra's face.
[3915.76s -> 3920.90s]  How the hell am I gonna get that? They get so scared and they just run off.
[3920.90s -> 3926.29s]  Can I get like a different costume to make me hide or something?
[3926.29s -> 3939.16s]  Just wait. They'll get in here. This counts as a... right in front of the face, right?
[3939.16s -> 3949.46s]  Come on. I'm just a statue. They don't even know I'm here.
[3949.46s -> 3969.68s]  Got it. I need a better lens. What was the last thing we did?
[3969.68s -> 3977.76s]  Let me try it one more time. Perfect. Oh, this is gonna be good.
[3977.76s -> 3982.95s]  Leave me alone. What the fuck are you doing? What are you doing?
[3982.95s -> 3986.95s]  I had it lined up perfectly and you just tethered me back here.
[3986.95s -> 3991.96s]  Oh, god damn it. Whatever. I gotta get the topi, right?
[3991.96s -> 3999.32s]  Let me take a look at those photos. Just make sure they're fucking clean.
[3999.32s -> 4005.22s]  That's good. That one's really good. It's definitely this one.
[4005.22s -> 4012.24s]  Too far away. No. That's a good one.
[4012.24s -> 4023.00s]  This camera sucks. That's the good one. Somebody said rule of thirds
[4023.00s -> 4033.96s]  is a myth that makes your photos look like shit. What do you mean it's a myth?
[4033.96s -> 4040.68s]  Alright, let's go find... I really want to get the zebra
[4040.68s -> 4046.26s]  right in the face. Let me try that one more. I gotta get that. I can't just go.
[4046.26s -> 4050.26s]  Look, maybe if he drives the car a little bit closer he won't be like, get back here!
[4050.26s -> 4059.99s]  You're too far away! Stop.
[4060.99s -> 4078.27s]  He's got to get right in their path. I had it too and it just limited a loading screen.
[4078.27s -> 4097.85s]  Fuck! I had it set up like two different times.
[4097.85s -> 4103.63s]  And that guy just... Wait, careful! You're going too far!
[4103.63s -> 4116.24s]  Whatever. It's close enough. I had to see two different loading screens
[4116.24s -> 4122.84s]  when I had the shit ready to go. It's because he was worried about you.
[4122.84s -> 4128.04s]  Don't be worried about me. I'm a fucking Francine... No, don't go back to the base camp.
[4128.04s -> 4135.92s]  Actually, yeah. Go back to the base camp.
[4135.92s -> 4141.31s]  I'm looking for a... Topey. Is that one right there?
[4141.31s -> 4148.41s]  I think there's one right here. Can I go that far? Stop.
[4148.41s -> 4161.00s]  That's definitely one right here. Does it have the same pattern that they want?
[4161.00s -> 4172.59s]  I can't tell. I think it does. Yep, it does. Get in there.
[4172.59s -> 4178.43s]  Alright, just in case it runs away, let's get like a dogshit grandma photo.
[4178.43s -> 4190.46s]  Just so we can at least prove that we did it. Don't you fucking dare pull me back right now.
[4190.46s -> 4194.46s]  You fucking asshole. Stop this. I have a perfect opportunity.
[4195.46s -> 4210.04s]  They want a side profile. Got it.
[4210.04s -> 4214.47s]  Zoom in. I have a default camera. I can't go that far.
[4214.47s -> 4222.98s]  Can I get closer? Oh god, that's perfect.
[4222.98s -> 4240.13s]  Stay right there. Don't move. Alright, now get out of here!
[4240.13s -> 4251.16s]  I should have every photo I need. Why are you being so nasty? No, I'm trying to get him away.
[4251.16s -> 4255.16s]  There could be predators around. He's standing still from my photo.
[4255.16s -> 4268.04s]  No, get out of here. Go. Go back to your family.
[4268.04s -> 4273.30s]  I could have died 30 minutes ago. It isn't real life though.
[4273.30s -> 4289.62s]  Yeah, I'll say it now. The hippo would have just snapped you in half.
[4289.62s -> 4300.15s]  I need to get a huge lens. Yeah, once we start making money I can start buying stuff.
[4300.15s -> 4312.99s]  Get a six foot camera lens. I don't know if I can get a comedy lens.
[4312.99s -> 4322.99s]  How is the safari? You look satisfied with the photos you took.
[4322.99s -> 4333.74s]  Let's examine them. Make sure we get the right ones. Send the right ones in our emails.
[4333.74s -> 4338.24s]  That was a loud, dangerous sound. I don't know if you guys heard that.
[4338.24s -> 4344.19s]  Let's go to the laptop. Let's see. Photos.
[4344.19s -> 4351.47s]  Transferring photos. Let's take a look.
[4351.47s -> 4355.47s]  Request just came in. This is for a drinking giraffe.
[4355.47s -> 4360.60s]  I do have a photo. Which one was it?
[4360.60s -> 4367.39s]  Let's see. We got this one, and then this one.
[4367.39s -> 4371.39s]  That's the only two I got, right? Yeah, that's too far away.
[4371.39s -> 4375.39s]  Too hazy and far away. I saw the animals in the shot too.
[4375.39s -> 4383.71s]  This is terrible. It's this one. Select this one.
[4383.71s -> 4392.41s]  That's the one. That's got to be a great angle.
[4392.41s -> 4396.59s]  How is that not better? Distance is angle.
[4396.59s -> 4401.85s]  That's not a good angle. I got a C for that picture.
[4401.85s -> 4406.73s]  That's a beautiful piece of photography right there. Didn't get the full 20 grand.
[4406.73s -> 4414.54s]  This one is done. It should have been in the center.
[4414.54s -> 4418.54s]  I have rule of thirds. This is bullshit.
[4418.54s -> 4423.36s]  We didn't get the herd of the gazelles yet.
[4423.36s -> 4427.53s]  This is the side profile of that
[4427.53s -> 4433.05s]  topi.
[4433.05s -> 4441.77s]  Let's take a look. I don't like this photo though. It's ugly.
[4441.77s -> 4455.40s]  This one is better. This one looks like shit.
[4455.40s -> 4463.28s]  That's definitely a better picture. The color correction is awful.
[4463.28s -> 4467.28s]  This one is better? I feel like the tree in the background and the dirt in the background
[4467.28s -> 4471.90s]  is screwing up the composition there. Look at the dirt and the sand
[4471.90s -> 4476.20s]  in the background. And his face is not defined
[4476.20s -> 4481.92s]  with the tree in the background. This one is better.
[4481.92s -> 4496.43s]  That's what I'm saying. Told you guys. Come on.
[4496.43s -> 4500.67s]  They weren't asking for a face shot. They were asking for just a side profile.
[4500.67s -> 4504.67s]  That's going against what the client asked and what the client
[4504.67s -> 4515.31s]  was paying for. This one on the other hand, I didn't get.
[4515.31s -> 4521.15s]  Let me see. Face shot from head on.
[4521.15s -> 4530.43s]  That's not right.
[4530.43s -> 4539.05s]  That's not correct. If that's what they want, then that's not what they got.
[4539.05s -> 4546.43s]  Just for curiosity, I can't even do it. You can only do these
[4546.43s -> 4550.73s]  missions once. Send it anyway. No, no. You only get to do them once.
[4550.73s -> 4555.87s]  But we do have new photos. It's 3000
[4555.87s -> 4563.82s]  per new animal, which we have hippos here.
[4563.82s -> 4568.68s]  They both suck.
[4568.68s -> 4576.54s]  It's the turkey. Probably this one. This one sucks.
[4576.54s -> 4589.15s]  At least this one has a face. Bad distance. I mean, kind of
[4589.15s -> 4597.28s]  okay distance in technique. Not really though. Hippopotamus.
[4597.28s -> 4601.28s]  And was there any others that I didn't get that were in?
[4601.28s -> 4605.82s]  No, we got them all. Alright, I'll delete all these.
[4605.82s -> 4610.06s]  I'll get rid of these fucking things. I need the herd of gazelles
[4610.06s -> 4614.06s]  and a face shot of a zebra.
[4614.06s -> 4631.69s]  So let me go back. Let's get rid of these. Delete them.
[4631.69s -> 4639.64s]  Transfer this one. How do I just transfer this?
[4639.64s -> 4649.77s]  I want to keep this one. I can't keep this one forever?
[4649.77s -> 4656.24s]  Or does it just sit in here? If I go shopping, shopping.
[4656.24s -> 4662.97s]  I want to go shopping. Hit X. I was pressing X. It didn't do anything.
[4662.97s -> 4668.04s]  Free shipping around the world. Wouldn't that be interesting? I don't have money.
[4668.04s -> 4676.57s]  Save. Press X when in the transfer screen. I was.
[4676.57s -> 4693.47s]  I was pressing X. Didn't do anything. Broke? Well, I just started.
[4693.47s -> 4700.83s]  Have I caught all the Pokemon yet? No. Not yet.
[4700.83s -> 4704.83s]  Don't you have camera experience from the wedding jobs you took in real life?
[4704.83s -> 4709.77s]  Well, I have video experience, not photo experience.
[4709.77s -> 4716.06s]  They're in the same kind of category, but they're kind of like cousins.
[4716.06s -> 4720.06s]  Recording something that is potentially moving around and distance and
[4720.06s -> 4724.06s]  location and lighting is a lot different instead of still picture.
[4724.06s -> 4740.19s]  Ah, this is painful. This save. What is the save time?
[4740.19s -> 4744.19s]  Yeah, if you're just joining us, for some reason there's a 400 megabyte save file
[4744.19s -> 4748.19s]  and there's nothing I can do about it. It's the rarest
[4748.19s -> 4752.19s]  joke that people get angry at because I said it like five times in the first 20 minutes
[4752.19s -> 4756.94s]  of the stream. Alright, that's good. Let's go.
[4756.94s -> 4761.37s]  I have to let go to sleep, right? New day?
[4761.37s -> 4769.13s]  Can I look at the cameras? Can I do anything with the camera?
[4769.13s -> 4775.28s]  Can I buy something for this? Type F. No, I need to buy a new
[4775.28s -> 4786.03s]  camera. Alright, let's go to bed. F, F, F, F, F, F, F.
[4786.03s -> 4793.60s]  This lazy shit just reads while I take photos.
[4793.60s -> 4800.25s]  There's elephants down there? Look it. There's elephants. There's probably like
[4800.25s -> 4806.48s]  T-Rexes and shit. Alright, we need the... Wait, I gotta take that
[4806.48s -> 4810.48s]  mission first. We're probably gonna have a bunch of emails now.
[4810.48s -> 4815.23s]  Alright, we got two opportunities.
[4815.23s -> 4821.44s]  This one's boring. The ultimate big mouth.
[4840.44s -> 4852.13s]  Okay, I'll do it. That one's more interesting.
[4852.13s -> 4856.56s]  We need the close-up of the face and a hippo
[4856.56s -> 4861.19s]  yawning. You got it.
[4861.19s -> 4865.19s]  Hey, let the professional decide what they're going to do.
[4865.19s -> 4869.81s]  Mr. Reading Harry Potter start to finish.
[4869.81s -> 4874.88s]  I don't have my... I have a thing that I put on the ground to wheel.
[4874.88s -> 4892.55s]  And I took it out because I VR-ified my room.
[4892.55s -> 4897.04s]  It's like I'm glued to the ground right now.
[4897.04s -> 4901.04s]  Okay. Hello, Francine. We're looking for
[4901.04s -> 4915.57s]  hippos this time, right? Oh, jumbo.
[4915.57s -> 4920.20s]  If it's not far, but let me take you to the hippo pool. Go ahead and hop in the back.
[4920.20s -> 4926.29s]  Snap a yawning hippopotamus. I'm gonna try.
[4926.29s -> 4941.08s]  How do hippos... I'm not gonna read that, but I don't know. I have no idea.
[4941.08s -> 4946.72s]  I don't know. Okay, let's go.
[4946.72s -> 4958.69s]  Go hide in a bush. When the screen flashes red, I'm getting too close.
[4958.69s -> 4965.09s]  Here comes a big yawn.
[4965.09s -> 4973.99s]  Am I hidden right now? This one seems pretty alerted.
[4973.99s -> 4989.81s]  This one seems pretty alerted. I got it.
[4989.81s -> 4994.05s]  I got a pretty good video of that hippo coming to kill me.
[4994.05s -> 4998.05s]  You wake up in the fucking hippo. Oh, you all right? No photos
[4998.05s -> 5017.25s]  worth risking life and limb over. You're finally awake.
[5017.25s -> 5021.25s]  Hey, I didn't get your yawning hippo, but I got a great YouTube
[5021.25s -> 5025.43s]  like Facebook video of that. That's gonna be shared.
[5025.43s -> 5042.07s]  50 million times. Let's try again.
[5042.07s -> 5050.79s]  Hide in a bush. I gotta be very, very careful. Very patient.
[5050.79s -> 5058.36s]  For a second at the top, I thought that said, stop a yawning
[5058.36s -> 5063.68s]  hippopotamus. Stop them from yawning. What am I supposed to do?
[5063.68s -> 5077.70s]  This time, I'm gonna be very cautious.
[5077.70s -> 5084.93s]  They're all turning the other way. Yawning hippo.
[5084.93s -> 5094.87s]  That one right in the middle. Or on the left. One on the left?
[5094.87s -> 5104.21s]  That's not a bad shot. Not a bad shot if you just open your mouth.
[5104.21s -> 5108.77s]  I gotta wait for it. If he lifts his head up over the bush, that would look so good.
[5108.77s -> 5137.00s]  Who's gonna do it? Which one of you, like, thumbs
[5137.00s -> 5152.55s]  is gonna open your mouth? I can't get closer than this. Do it.
[5152.55s -> 5160.69s]  Zoom in. I have the default camera. I can't go in any further.
[5160.69s -> 5173.44s]  And if I get closer, they'll attack me. Look, I'm gonna come out of the camera mode and
[5173.44s -> 5185.35s]  I'm gonna do it. Oh yeah, you yawn first. That's right.
[5185.35s -> 5208.50s]  No? Did it work? Yawn. Somebody yawn.
[5208.50s -> 5223.30s]  I can't get closer. The last time I got closer, they tried
[5223.30s -> 5237.00s]  to kill me. No, this one just went to bed. Come on, somebody do it.
[5237.00s -> 5258.37s]  They're both asleep. Wait. You just woke... Okay, that's actually not a bad thing.
[5258.37s -> 5262.68s]  You just woke this one up. Maybe it'll do a, I just woke up yawn.
[5262.68s -> 5275.52s]  No, don't turn the other direction. They're behind you. Where are you going?
[5275.52s -> 5295.03s]  Turn this way. Alright, it has to be you. No, no, no, no.
[5295.03s -> 5305.41s]  Don't obstruct it from the... Shot ruined.
[5305.41s -> 5331.44s]  I'm gonna have to get this one over here. Yawn. Oh, this is not a bad shot.
[5331.44s -> 5337.54s]  Come on, do it. You just woke up. This is your opportunity to yawn. Do it.
[5337.54s -> 5358.85s]  How much is this one? You're the only one left in the pool. Please just yawn.
[5358.85s -> 5365.44s]  When is your AI gonna understand that it's time to yawn?
[5365.44s -> 5375.80s]  Is that about the yawns?
[5375.80s -> 5379.80s]  No, it's a huge thing. They go like, they look like a snake
[5379.80s -> 5383.80s]  when they do it. The jaws unhinge. And they like a swallow and
[5383.80s -> 5390.85s]  an egg. I don't think that was a yawn. I could probably pass it off as one though.
[5390.85s -> 5398.16s]  The mouth is open. Whoops, that's a... I don't want to do vertical.
[5398.16s -> 5417.09s]  Great. Wait, wait, wait. He's turning around. This is good.
[5417.09s -> 5421.09s]  This is really good, really good, really good. Do it. No, no, no, no. This way.
[5421.09s -> 5429.94s]  No, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Wait for him to land. Wait for him to land.
[5429.94s -> 5457.83s]  Okay. That was a yawn coming up. Nope. Get out of here.
[5457.83s -> 5462.20s]  I think Gazelle just ruined everything. Oh, you know what? That's... I'm gonna take...
[5462.20s -> 5469.81s]  Right? Why not just take that? That's a good turning
[5469.81s -> 5481.91s]  profile picture. Where's the other hippo? Just still
[5481.91s -> 5498.10s]  sitting there. Isn't there a third hippo? This really is what...
[5498.10s -> 5502.10s]  You guys think this is... Wow, this is boring. I've seen
[5502.10s -> 5506.10s]  like Planet Earth. I've seen the National Geographic stuff. It's so much more interesting than this.
[5506.10s -> 5511.36s]  No, it isn't. To get the photo of the
[5511.36s -> 5515.73s]  hippopotamus yawning and have it really look cool and on like the National Geographic
[5515.73s -> 5519.73s]  PBS stuff. Somebody comes out here and does this for like six straight days.
[5519.73s -> 5532.36s]  Just hang out here and they just eat like sandwiches.
[5532.36s -> 5536.36s]  You want to know why that's so difficult to do? Because think about that.
[5536.36s -> 5540.36s]  There is one moment that you have to be ready to take the photo.
[5540.36s -> 5544.36s]  And it might take up to five straight days before you get it. At any point
[5544.36s -> 5548.36s]  in those five days. You gotta be like, oh shit! And like grab
[5548.36s -> 5552.72s]  like snap! Because you might be sitting there for like 16 hours.
[5552.72s -> 5563.35s]  That's hard. Will you open your mouth and yawn please? There's the other one.
[5563.35s -> 5567.65s]  Do a double yawn. Do like a Dragon Ball Z fusion yawn together.
[5567.65s -> 5585.06s]  Come on. This is a bad photo. I have to move. This is a
[5585.06s -> 5589.06s]  hippopotamus right? I just want to be like, yes, yes it is. Because they're not
[5589.06s -> 5599.38s]  yawning. These are elephants. These are baby
[5599.38s -> 5603.68s]  elephants. They could be. But what if they... Good. Now yawn
[5603.68s -> 5607.68s]  together. One, two, three, yawn.
[5607.68s -> 5613.84s]  Can they see me? Is that why they're not doing this? Is that why they're not comfortable
[5613.84s -> 5621.60s]  enough to yawn because I'm sitting here? They said, the guy told me to hide in a
[5621.60s -> 5627.89s]  bush. He said hide in a bush.
[5627.89s -> 5639.28s]  Only these bushes are here. Bingo. You aren't in a bush.
[5639.28s -> 5644.16s]  I can't take a photo inside the bush. Alright.
[5644.16s -> 5648.53s]  I'm in the bush. Cool. Let's take a photo. That is just good.
[5648.53s -> 5670.37s]  Do it. This is good. This depth of field here. Come on. Open your
[5670.37s -> 5692.90s]  mouth. Please. Do it. That's not depth of field.
[5692.90s -> 5699.51s]  It's low resolution. Well, whatever. How are you not...
[5699.51s -> 5708.20s]  Here it comes. I gotta be ready. What was that? What?
[5708.20s -> 5712.20s]  Was that a fast yawn? That was like a super fast forward, fast forward
[5712.20s -> 5736.66s]  motion yawn. I'm so angry.
[5736.66s -> 5744.40s]  Just like in real life. I almost wasn't ready. Do it.
[5744.40s -> 5749.65s]  Come on. He's getting right into frame. Right now. Stop.
[5749.65s -> 5753.65s]  Open the mouth. Let's go. Come on. Don't get blocked by the low res
[5753.65s -> 5757.65s]  grass, bush thing. Don't do it. Do it. Here we go.
[5757.65s -> 5770.82s]  One. Two. Do it.
[5770.82s -> 5784.39s]  Is that gonna be flurry? Why?
[5784.39s -> 5790.85s]  Wait. Yes. Perfect. See ya later.
[5790.85s -> 5799.68s]  Check him first. Hold on. Check him. Check him. Check him. Good.
[5799.68s -> 5808.24s]  That's the best one. Look at that one.
[5808.24s -> 5820.15s]  The rest of these are just not. I don't even know what these are.
[5820.15s -> 5824.15s]  I was taking a photo trying to time the mouth opening and I didn't get it once.
[5824.15s -> 5833.68s]  I almost got it right there. I like these two.
[5833.68s -> 5840.93s]  They just look like two terriers looking at me. I like this one.
[5840.93s -> 5848.50s]  I do. Well, we got the thing we needed.
[5848.50s -> 5855.54s]  What's the other mission we can do? Let's see. Yeah, get a shot of those
[5855.54s -> 5860.29s]  zebra and herd of gazelles. I need a zebra.
[5860.29s -> 5864.98s]  I need to get that zebra shot. Let's go. No, don't go back to the camp.
[5864.98s -> 5872.34s]  You can't take me a little bit further out. Why? Why can you not take me
[5872.34s -> 5880.15s]  further out? Zebra right here. No, I can't go that far away.
[5880.15s -> 5890.12s]  Let's just turn this one in. Was it inevitable?
[5890.12s -> 5898.76s]  Was it inevitable? I think it was inevitable. Uh oh.
[5898.76s -> 5916.04s]  We're going back down to zero, boys and girls.
[5916.04s -> 5946.29s]  I got the photo. We good? Wait, we're back. German is disappearing.
[5946.29s -> 5959.22s]  Quick, get in. It was a long drive, but we made it.
[5959.22s -> 5965.70s]  Yeah, we have some other issues going on here.
[5965.70s -> 5971.35s]  Something got fucked up. Something definitely got really fucked up.
[5971.35s -> 5975.35s]  We're seeing some odd shit at this residence, I'll tell ya.
[5975.35s -> 5982.32s]  Alright, so far it was good. That was me.
[5982.32s -> 5992.05s]  Alright, let's get these out of here.
[5992.05s -> 5997.68s]  Is this whole game just to sell people Sony cameras?
[5997.68s -> 6002.31s]  Sony? At least Sony cameras? They don't look like Sony.
[6002.31s -> 6006.61s]  Is that a Sony video camera? You know what I mean by that.
[6006.61s -> 6014.61s]  Well, none of you guys are going to buy this shit. This is like 12 years ago.
[6014.61s -> 6024.61s]  Alright, this is the one we're going to use. Wait, wait, wait.
[6024.61s -> 6028.61s]  It's doing a poor job. Alright, $20,000. We got the yawn.
[6028.61s -> 6037.43s]  Let's take a look. Uh, I don't know. This is tough.
[6037.43s -> 6041.43s]  Because, here's the problem. This one is definitely way more pronounced.
[6041.43s -> 6045.43s]  But this one is centered.
[6045.43s -> 6057.54s]  The mouth is actually, you can see down, like the urinal.
[6057.54s -> 6063.25s]  The tilted one is a big, what about over here? Nah, not these ones.
[6063.25s -> 6071.59s]  This one has more emotion behind it. That's really tired.
[6071.59s -> 6080.82s]  But yeah, somebody said the game is probably coded for the
[6080.82s -> 6093.51s]  looking down the PVC pipe. I like this photo better,
[6093.51s -> 6104.07s]  but this one's probably worth more points. I'm going with that one.
[6104.07s -> 6111.32s]  I'm going with my gut here. Target, distance, excellent technique.
[6111.32s -> 6116.71s]  Alright, now that's alright. I got exactly what I came in for.
[6116.71s -> 6124.90s]  $20,000. Oh yeah, by the way, sorry for telling you.
[6124.90s -> 6129.40s]  The pre-stream was a little odd. Because I'm just sitting there
[6129.40s -> 6133.40s]  going, yeah, we're wearing the bright red. There's no stream today.
[6133.40s -> 6137.40s]  Stream's not happening today, is what I said in the chat. And then I got green.
[6137.40s -> 6141.40s]  And then the problem was fixed. And then me and Italics were talking about
[6141.40s -> 6145.40s]  how we can kill bandwidth to each other now somehow, which wasn't
[6145.40s -> 6149.40s]  really necessarily a problem before.
[6149.40s -> 6153.40s]  And we had like fucking 60 plus mile per hour winds in Vegas.
[6153.40s -> 6157.40s]  It was raining. I don't know, there's a lot of weird shit going on. So there's probably like more than two or three
[6157.40s -> 6161.40s]  problems, but I was told they were going to get fixed today. So we'll see.
[6161.40s -> 6167.28s]  Alright, so let me...
[6167.28s -> 6171.46s]  I got $63,000. Should I get more photo storage or just save it?
[6171.46s -> 6176.28s]  I think I have to buy this to unlock the next couple of things to buy.
[6176.28s -> 6185.89s]  Alright, we'll save it. So let's go to sleep.
[6185.89s -> 6194.08s]  See what we get in the morning. See what new missions we get.
[6194.08s -> 6199.67s]  Yeah, apparently Valentine's Day broke a rain record. Like across
[6199.67s -> 6205.00s]  all of Vegas. It was raining everywhere. Alright, what do you got for me today?
[6205.00s -> 6214.79s]  Nothing, still on the same page in the book. Alright, head
[6214.79s -> 6220.18s]  we gotta get this. Yeah, we have to just get the herd.
[6220.18s -> 6228.32s]  The herd of gazelles and the zebra head.
[6228.32s -> 6235.06s]  Let's go take a look at the map. We need to take a photo of the herd of gazelles.
[6235.06s -> 6239.06s]  Look for a chance to capture as many gazelles as possible in one shot.
[6239.06s -> 6251.28s]  So let's just go. Let's not pick like a place.
[6251.28s -> 6255.28s]  I don't know why, but for one second I thought this just quit to my desktop and this was my desktop
[6255.28s -> 6260.55s]  background. I don't know why I thought that. I was like what the fuck, why are we on my desktop?
[6260.55s -> 6273.48s]  I don't know why. This is the standard Windows XP
[6273.48s -> 6280.39s]  background. Yeah, this is the
[6280.39s -> 6285.46s]  Dell computer background that has never changed in ten years.
[6285.46s -> 6312.07s]  Alright, let's take a picture of some gazelles. What is that? I don't know,
[6312.07s -> 6324.82s]  it looks like a cat. It's gonna be so blurry. Can I look at them?
[6324.82s -> 6334.12s]  Now this is, I was testing the white balance. That's what this photo is.
[6334.12s -> 6338.12s]  I'm not taking pictures of anything, I'm just testing the camera to make sure I have enough battery to take a picture.
[6338.12s -> 6366.84s]  It's a pretty nice big footprint. No, I need a better
[6366.84s -> 6374.96s]  camera. Can't take photos out of the window of a car.
[6374.96s -> 6383.75s]  Alright, where are these gazelles? I don't see a herd of gazelles anywhere.
[6383.75s -> 6388.69s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[6388.69s -> 6399.24s]  Okay, let's get set up. Should they be running? It wants a
[6399.24s -> 6407.00s]  stampede of gazelles, right? I gotta get as many as possible.
[6407.00s -> 6432.64s]  I gotta get back it up a little. That distance is bad. I got, I already
[6432.64s -> 6446.80s]  got it, I got it. I already got it. That's a good photo, but it's not a whole
[6446.80s -> 6461.59s]  herd. Alright, now make them run. I got it already, right? Alright, get it.
[6461.59s -> 6470.93s]  Why does this look like shit? There's something wrong about this photo. Why does this look
[6470.93s -> 6478.56s]  so off? No, get back in the car and drive me to where I need to go.
[6478.56s -> 6488.18s]  There's too much ground in that photo. That's exactly what it is. Alright, take me to the tree.
[6488.18s -> 6501.88s]  Okay, now I can walk a little further.
[6501.88s -> 6506.95s]  What constitutes a herd? Is a herd three or more?
[6506.95s -> 6521.20s]  At the umbrella tree. Three or more is a herd.
[6521.20s -> 6529.28s]  At least fifteen. Alright, this couple right here.
[6529.28s -> 6539.14s]  Let's get a little closer. Not bad, not bad. Turn, turn, turn, turn.
[6539.14s -> 6550.10s]  Tilt. One on the top left. Turn a little. How many grains
[6550.10s -> 6556.07s]  of sand is a beach? No, that's true. It's because of the sand that doesn't mean
[6556.07s -> 6565.94s]  it's a beach. No, it has to, I gotta go this way.
[6565.94s -> 6574.98s]  That's bordering on a goddamn ocean. Let me go over here.
[6574.98s -> 6579.28s]  I think I fucked up my opportunity to take a good picture. So they're getting the terrible one.
[6579.28s -> 6583.28s]  It's just for like a classroom, right? It's for students.
[6583.28s -> 6593.78s]  They don't need a National Geographic quality photo. They just need
[6593.78s -> 6604.66s]  a photo. Yeah, I scared them all off. There's one more down there.
[6604.66s -> 6623.54s]  Yeah, I blew it. Let's go. I'm gonna have to use that terrible one.
[6623.54s -> 6639.14s]  She probably stinks. What?
[6639.14s -> 6654.95s]  Watch out, watch out, watch out. Don't run them over. There's definitely no animal
[6654.95s -> 6662.20s]  run over physics. I would guarantee that's not the case. I got a photo
[6662.20s -> 6671.62s]  100 degrees and you can't shower.
[6671.62s -> 6678.16s]  You can like roll around in one of these little lakes.
[6678.16s -> 6682.40s]  One of these little ponds. You can just like roll around in it with some like Dove.
[6682.40s -> 6687.48s]  Just buy like his 25 pack of the Dove dog shit
[6687.48s -> 6696.32s]  brand. Get like a Lever 2000 or something.
[6696.32s -> 6702.53s]  It's probably like full. Don't, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop the car, stop the car,
[6702.53s -> 6706.53s]  stop the car, stop the car, stop the car, stop the car, stop the car,
[6706.53s -> 6775.41s]  stop the car. Come on, look over here. This is good.
[6775.41s -> 6779.72s]  This is good. There's a little too much tree. Bingo. There's the shot right there.
[6779.72s -> 6803.67s]  Maybe, hold on, one more, one more. It's not even in focus.
[6803.67s -> 6811.78s]  We'll get one like dead on too. Over here. Watch this shit.
[6811.78s -> 6817.41s]  This is gonna be fucking beautiful. It's gonna get a little bit of leaf,
[6817.41s -> 6827.92s]  a little bit of leaves in the foreground. I need a better lens.
[6827.92s -> 6837.99s]  Oh, fuck, there's another one. Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look. This is perfect.
[6837.99s -> 6841.99s]  It's like a cat sitting on a tree. Come on, get the leaves. We need foreground,
[6841.99s -> 6846.61s]  mid-ground, background. No, no, this is not a good enough lens.
[6846.61s -> 6862.10s]  I can't do what I want to do. Whatever. None of those will work.
[6862.10s -> 6869.20s]  Do I actually have to have the car take me there? Smelly lady.
[6869.20s -> 6873.20s]  You don't know that. Oh, there is a Sony lanyard on her neck.
[6873.20s -> 6877.20s]  Now I understand why you guys saying Sony sponsor.
[6877.20s -> 6893.52s]  How was the safari? It was good. Okay, transfer those.
[6893.52s -> 6900.63s]  I don't care if one of the photos is terrible. Let's get an email going.
[6900.63s -> 6905.76s]  Head, a herd of gazelles. I don't know if we have that many.
[6905.76s -> 6913.57s]  It's only for 10,000. Who cares? Let's take a look.
[6913.57s -> 6918.76s]  I like that one. That one's pretty great. This is the best one.
[6918.76s -> 6924.20s]  No, sucks. Delete. I like it. It's quaint.
[6924.20s -> 6929.20s]  No, this one's good. Not good. Actually,
[6929.20s -> 6933.44s]  kind of good. This is not a bad photo. If only
[6933.44s -> 6937.44s]  that one in the, all the way far to the top right. If it was just two.
[6937.44s -> 6947.57s]  There it is. There it is. Okay. This photo's really bad, but it's the only one that's a
[6947.57s -> 6959.41s]  real herd. It has to be this one. Whatever.
[6959.41s -> 6966.85s]  I'll take the D-minus that I'm going to get for this photo.
[6966.85s -> 6975.19s]  I'm sorry. I'll take a C. Now we, ultimate big mouth. Didn't I already do this?
[6975.19s -> 6980.05s]  Oh yeah, these are done. Okay. Let's get the
[6980.05s -> 6989.72s]  picture of the, whatever it is in the tree.
[6989.72s -> 6994.79s]  Clearly this is, ah, this is clearly the best photo. Or this one. So let's just
[6994.79s -> 7003.38s]  give him a shitty one, because I want to hold on to a couple of these. Okay, this is like a very clear
[7003.38s -> 7010.63s]  I'm staring right in the camera picture, send it over. Marvelous. Marvelous.
[7010.63s -> 7017.75s]  Marvelous. Perfect score. Uh, that's a
[7017.75s -> 7023.52s]  vervet monkey adult. Uh, I need to delete some of these. Let's save
[7023.52s -> 7029.68s]  a couple of them. Not this one. Get rid of that. I like this one. Get rid of
[7029.68s -> 7033.68s]  this one. Get rid of this one. Keep that one. I like it. I don't,
[7033.68s -> 7037.68s]  all these can go. We already got the yawn done, so I'm going to keep the one that
[7037.68s -> 7046.39s]  I like. I like that one. Bad, bad, bad, bad.
[7046.39s -> 7054.02s]  No, keep turkey. Delete. So again, let's try
[7054.02s -> 7059.01s]  this again. X. X. X.
[7059.01s -> 7063.32s]  Check. Check all. X. I can't, like,
[7063.32s -> 7071.08s]  bring them over anywhere. They might just have to sit here. Unless, like,
[7071.08s -> 7077.03s]  there's something I'm missing. I need to buy the storage.
[7077.03s -> 7090.48s]  Really. First number you can hold to 50. Carry with your camera
[7090.48s -> 7094.48s]  without feeling, no, this is the camera. Yeah, that's the camera photo
[7094.48s -> 7098.85s]  still. Alright, let's go to bed.
[7098.85s -> 7105.14s]  Wake up in the morning. See what's on the list. I can't wait to do a tiger.
[7105.14s -> 7117.49s]  Don't forget to check your email. I do every day, man.
[7117.49s -> 7121.49s]  Important. Camera repairs complete. The camera you sent in
[7121.49s -> 7126.50s]  for repairs before your departure just came back. New camera.
[7126.50s -> 7130.93s]  It's a digital SLR camera. The A100 lens kit.
[7130.93s -> 7134.93s]  We've made arrangements so you can use it right away to take great photos for us, of course.
[7134.93s -> 7143.76s]  Okay, this is a tree monkey.
[7143.76s -> 7147.76s]  Tree monkey with a black face, okay. Hello, Francine. My name is David Moore.
[7147.76s -> 7151.76s]  I work with the African Photo Press. We're currently looking for a shot of a
[7151.76s -> 7155.76s]  vervet monkey climbing a tree. I already got one. I already do- it's done.
[7155.76s -> 7160.71s]  To fill out our wildlife photo collection. If you've taken any, could you send them my way?
[7160.71s -> 7164.71s]  If it's any help, vervet monkeys are often spotted where humans live. Good luck.
[7164.71s -> 7169.97s]  Already got it. Done. Good thing I held onto it. That's good.
[7169.97s -> 7181.17s]  That's a good photo, too. Done. Take it.
[7181.17s -> 7190.02s]  Thanks for the money. Cool. So now what?
[7190.02s -> 7196.88s]  Go back to bed. Let me go look at my camera, though.
[7196.88s -> 7201.44s]  A100. DT 18-70. F-stop is 3.55.
[7201.44s -> 7205.88s]  Cool. The camera we sent to the head office for repairs has come back.
[7205.88s -> 7209.88s]  Put it inside the camera case. You can check it any time. Proper focusing is key to using this camera.
[7209.88s -> 7213.88s]  Now the camera is set to autofocus. If you're not sure of a function,
[7213.88s -> 7221.83s]  consult the camera photography manual on the bookshelf.
[7221.83s -> 7225.83s]  So this is an autofocus camera. It's a body. Basic features intended
[7225.83s -> 7229.83s]  for amateurs. Get rid of that. An easy to use camera utilizing super
[7229.83s -> 7237.01s]  steady shot image stabilization and advanced autofocus.
[7237.01s -> 7242.60s]  Lens. Standard zoom lens mimics the human eye's field of vision for a true
[7242.60s -> 7246.60s]  perspective, not intended for long distance shots. There it is.
[7246.60s -> 7257.80s]  So it's just on there. All right. Are they getting new tools or anything?
[7257.80s -> 7266.77s]  Let's go look at the bookshelf. I want a Sony camera.
[7266.77s -> 7271.40s]  All right. We've got to look at some of this. A100. Full featured
[7271.40s -> 7275.40s]  camera, but you can always use auto mode if you want to keep things simple.
[7275.40s -> 7279.40s]  I never use auto on a camera. I always go to manual focus.
[7279.40s -> 7283.40s]  The A100 has four noteworthy features. The lenses are interchangeable.
[7283.40s -> 7287.40s]  You can introduce selective blur. You can greatly customize how you shoot.
[7287.40s -> 7291.40s]  Plus, it helps stabilize camera shake. I'll introduce each one of these
[7291.40s -> 7297.03s]  in a separate column. Focus. We've all seen autofocus photos
[7297.03s -> 7301.03s]  for the subject. You meant to take a picture of lines of blurred. You need to focus on your subject.
[7301.03s -> 7305.03s]  With the A100, you can focus by half pressing the circle button or the R1 button.
[7305.03s -> 7309.03s]  That's not going to be terrible. Pressure sensitive PlayStation 3
[7309.03s -> 7313.03s]  bullshit. Great. If you move the left stick around while doing so, you can even change the
[7313.03s -> 7320.39s]  angle. A half press to focus.
[7320.39s -> 7328.37s]  And you can move the stick around. Depth field.
[7328.37s -> 7332.37s]  Depth field contributes to how much of your scene, what range around the focus distance
[7332.37s -> 7336.68s]  remains sharp. It's also tied to a lens's zoom. Zooming in limits the depth of
[7336.68s -> 7341.43s]  field while zooming out increases it. Yes. I know that.
[7341.43s -> 7345.43s]  Now we've got a camera menu. Oh boy, we have an actual camera menu.
[7345.43s -> 7349.43s]  Open the camera menu button by pressing triangle. From the camera
[7349.43s -> 7353.43s]  menu, you can change various camera preferences in addition to trickier photography settings.
[7353.43s -> 7357.43s]  You can also set preferences for continuous shooting, image confirmation after you snap
[7357.43s -> 7361.43s]  a photo, shooting in black and white, and so on. So that's triangle.
[7361.43s -> 7367.51s]  Different exposures.
[7367.51s -> 7371.51s]  Four modes. Auto, aperture priority, shutter speed priority, and manual exposure.
[7371.51s -> 7376.20s]  And auto, snapping pictures is fully automatic. Or half
[7376.20s -> 7380.20s]  auto for the other two. Half manual modes. In manual, you set everything up yourself.
[7380.20s -> 7386.48s]  Advanced users though. That's what I will be using. Yep.
[7386.48s -> 7390.92s]  Aperture priority. Uh huh.
[7390.92s -> 7395.35s]  Narrow depth of field for a low value. So you get to like really get
[7395.35s -> 7403.67s]  really, really detailed motion blur moments.
[7403.67s -> 7409.44s]  So we want low aperture value. Shutter speed. This is a good, this is very educational.
[7409.44s -> 7419.88s]  All this is good stuff. Shutter speed is how much
[7419.88s -> 7423.88s]  the lens remains open. 1, 30th of a second, I'm on 1,000th
[7423.88s -> 7427.88s]  of a second for example. Slow shutter speed, you get more motion blur
[7427.88s -> 7431.88s]  while faster shutter speeds will freeze your subjects in its tracks.
[7431.88s -> 7435.88s]  A little motion blur can punch up your action shots though.
[7435.88s -> 7441.51s]  Am I going to be taking pictures of that? Okay. We're going to need a high
[7441.51s -> 7447.92s]  shutter. Yeah, this is exposure, right?
[7447.92s -> 7453.30s]  How do I do it? Use plus to take brighter photos
[7453.30s -> 7457.30s]  minus mimics to take darker. Okay, well how do I just, I guess, correct it?
[7457.30s -> 7462.63s]  Ice. Ice start AF.
[7462.63s -> 7466.63s]  Original features focuses for you automatically even if you don't half press the shutter.
[7466.63s -> 7470.63s]  Naturally this is very useful since the camera will continue to focus for you as long as you have the viewfinder open.
[7470.63s -> 7475.51s]  I'm going to just go through it. I know how to do this shit. Creative style. You can change it to
[7475.51s -> 7479.88s]  like sepia, black and white. Yep. With the
[7479.88s -> 7483.88s]  continue, you can hold down the circle button to continuously snap photos.
[7483.88s -> 7487.88s]  You can set this up in the feature settings.
[7487.88s -> 7493.27s]  You're limited to three shots in a row. You need to release
[7493.27s -> 7503.00s]  the button before you can shoot again. I'm ready. Let's take a look.
[7503.00s -> 7507.30s]  I gotta go back to bed, right? Yeah, back to sleep. I already handed in the
[7507.30s -> 7519.33s]  perfect monkey one. New emails? No. What's the thing I
[7519.33s -> 7523.96s]  haven't done? I have to get a photo of this zebra.
[7523.96s -> 7529.52s]  Close up in the face. Alright, let's go.
[7529.52s -> 7545.97s]  Is this fun? Yeah. This is a good game.
[7545.97s -> 7556.15s]  Having fun. It's fun to take pictures of animals. Now we have a camera that
[7556.15s -> 7568.39s]  I can actually toggle different settings. And we're only in the first area.
[7568.39s -> 7576.15s]  This is the home of the area up there with lions and tigers and shit.
[7576.15s -> 7580.76s]  Let's take a look at the camera. Here we go. Here's our new camera.
[7580.76s -> 7588.56s]  Let's go into the settings here. Exposure mode. Aperture priority.
[7588.56s -> 7593.70s]  Let's do manual. Shutter speed. Let's get like a high shutter.
[7593.70s -> 7601.00s]  No, actually not yet. This is like the aperture stop.
[7601.00s -> 7608.42s]  I really wish I could see the auto-review
[7608.42s -> 7612.42s]  on creative style. I wish I could see what it looks like without
[7612.42s -> 7628.18s]  getting too... Shutter speed's too long. Well, I'm trying to... You'll see.
[7628.18s -> 7677.06s]  I need a zebra. Alright. Can you stop? Let's go.
[7677.06s -> 7689.99s]  Wait, what? There's a cheetah? Don't get... Let me out of the car. Let me out!
[7689.99s -> 7716.15s]  Oh god, he's gonna be... I gotta get him like stalking. I'm getting some
[7716.15s -> 7732.15s]  pretty good shots already here. I shouldn't even need to bring the camera out. He's gonna be
[7732.15s -> 7741.06s]  running fast. Heard of gazelles. It's this time the prey got away.
[7741.06s -> 7745.06s]  We know that the cheetahs live on the... Yeah, well what the hell? Why wouldn't you let me get out of the car?
[7745.06s -> 7753.04s]  Are you ready to go? What? Hold on.
[7753.04s -> 7760.53s]  Why wouldn't you let me get out of the car before? Alright, is there a zebra around here?
[7760.53s -> 7768.15s]  Alright, there's no... I do not see a zebra. Look, a cheetah! Stay in the fucking
[7768.15s -> 7782.92s]  car! Yeah, let's go. Why do you keep
[7782.92s -> 7806.10s]  stopping me? Is that a zebra? Over there? There it is.
[7806.10s -> 7816.42s]  I'm gonna be too far away from him though. You do know we're on the mission to take a picture
[7816.42s -> 7839.91s]  of a zebra, right? Where are my binoculars? Where the fuck are the
[7839.91s -> 7844.40s]  zebras? We just drove in a circle. I didn't see one
[7844.40s -> 7855.28s]  zebra. He just wanted to show me the cheetah and then take me home.
[7855.28s -> 7866.63s]  I'm definitely gonna get an email about cheetahs.
[7866.63s -> 7871.75s]  Alright, we're home. That was fun. That was good to see the... I'm glad we got to see
[7871.75s -> 7880.13s]  the cheetah. Email me about it tomorrow. Hold on a minute.
[7880.13s -> 7890.52s]  Alright, let's get... let's make some fucked up shit happen here.
[7890.52s -> 7918.16s]  Oh, look! I got a picture of that! That's so funny. That's such a ridiculous
[7918.16s -> 7924.52s]  shutter. Alright, let me go get the email about the
[7924.52s -> 7938.80s]  fucking cheetah. That was great today, but I didn't do anything.
[7938.80s -> 7947.40s]  You drove around in a circle. You encountered cheetah? Well, I'll write up the report.
[7947.40s -> 7956.88s]  Go to bed. Nah, I don't want to transfer these photos. I'm just making a joke.
[7956.88s -> 7966.04s]  He's like trying to get in the photo. You know,
[7966.04s -> 7970.04s]  the aperture is bad, but it makes it kind of
[7970.04s -> 7974.04s]  good. If only the shutter wasn't so stupid and I didn't have like a photo bomb
[7974.04s -> 7980.82s]  here. I think I'm gonna have to keep this one. No, no, no, no.
[7980.82s -> 7991.33s]  Okay, just go to bed. I'm gonna take a picture of a cheetah
[7991.33s -> 8000.76s]  stalking prey tomorrow or something, right? Okay, we got a new email
[8000.76s -> 8007.16s]  that's gonna be about a cheetah. Just you wait. Hunting at 60 miles
[8007.16s -> 8011.70s]  per hour. Mm-hmm. This is Peter O'Brien over at
[8011.70s -> 8016.00s]  National Geographic. Next month's feature is about hunters of the savanna.
[8016.00s -> 8020.00s]  And we want to talk about how cheetahs hunt. We'd like you to handle the photography.
[8020.00s -> 8024.00s]  The cheetah tears after its prey at 60 miles an hour.
[8024.00s -> 8028.00s]  You only get one moment to take the shot. It's an important job, but I know you're up to it.
[8028.00s -> 8038.63s]  This is apparently one of the harder difficulty ones.
[8038.63s -> 8048.93s]  I only get one chance. I didn't get a picture of a cheetah. Okay.
[8048.93s -> 8052.93s]  So I'm gonna save it here because I should.
[8052.93s -> 8057.11s]  And I'm also gonna go to the bathroom. So I'm gonna say it's gonna take, by the time this is done,
[8057.11s -> 8061.11s]  I'll be back. So let me just take a piss break. I'll be right back.
[8061.11s -> 8218.05s]  See you guys in a second. Alright. Have we saved? Good.
[8218.05s -> 8240.13s]  Alright. We've been asked to photograph a cheetah. Could you try to find that cheetah
[8240.13s -> 8244.13s]  again? This one's up to you. Hope you can get that perfect picture.
[8244.13s -> 8248.50s]  Did I accept the mission? Make sure I just accepted it.
[8248.50s -> 8258.61s]  Yeah. So do I need to take a photo of it killing something?
[8258.61s -> 8267.20s]  Or take a photo of it when it's about to kill something?
[8267.20s -> 8273.86s]  I'm gonna have to drop the shutter too. And do a burst photo. 60 miles per hour
[8273.86s -> 8283.41s]  I get one second. A photo of it about to kill you.
[8283.41s -> 8292.52s]  Take a selfie while being eaten at 60 miles per
[8292.52s -> 8301.04s]  fresh beer. I'm gonna say that every fucking time.
[8301.04s -> 8305.54s]  Looking for a cheetah. Let's try the ant hill. There was a cheetah in that area
[8305.54s -> 8321.67s]  before. Let's get in here. Continue shooting on
[8321.67s -> 8340.48s]  standard. Let's see what's going on here.
[8340.48s -> 8350.85s]  Let's see those photos. It's going too fast. Can I drop it?
[8350.85s -> 8361.92s]  Can I drop that? I couldn't go
[8361.92s -> 8375.81s]  up to these values before. I could not pick these before.
[8375.81s -> 8384.02s]  They're dark. I gotta bring the... Hold on.
[8384.02s -> 8389.46s]  We gotta open up the fucking eye a little bit here.
[8389.46s -> 8395.17s]  Is that gonna help? Nah. Fuck. We need exposure composition.
[8395.17s -> 8406.56s]  Exposure. Exposure plus one.
[8406.56s -> 8428.77s]  Fuck. The shutter's too high. It's too high.
[8428.77s -> 8443.28s]  Let's try this. It's not terrible. Let's try that.
[8443.28s -> 8449.51s]  320.
[8449.51s -> 8456.88s]  That looks okay. That looks okay. Alright. That doesn't look bad.
[8456.88s -> 8461.64s]  Adjust the aperture. God damn. I gotta do full manual here.
[8461.64s -> 8469.33s]  That's as much as I can go. I can't do exposure.
[8469.33s -> 8473.57s]  I gotta do it on shutter speed priority. Three and a half is as far as I can get it.
[8473.57s -> 8485.22s]  That doesn't look terrible. Okay. Nobody home at the anthill.
[8485.22s -> 8497.76s]  Let's try the oasis. Oh fuck. I have two. I gotta get
[8497.76s -> 8501.76s]  rid of these. How do I delete these? We're good. We're good. We're good.
[8501.76s -> 8507.41s]  The aperture cannot go lower than 3.5 on this camera.
[8507.41s -> 8532.37s]  Looking over there. Shooting. Auto review.
[8532.37s -> 8546.18s]  Those look cool. Let me make sure this...
[8546.18s -> 8555.72s]  Now that's gonna be fine. Not gonna be blurry before the
[8555.72s -> 8563.35s]  cheetah. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Stop the car. Stop the car. Stop the car.
[8563.35s -> 8567.35s]  Stop. Stop the car. Why can I not tell you to stop the car?
[8567.35s -> 8572.04s]  Get me off the rails. Why?
[8572.04s -> 8580.42s]  I wanna stop. It's an opportunity to get a picture of a zebra. Fuck. I'm gonna get one
[8580.42s -> 8586.90s]  opportunity and I'm gonna blow this. I got three shots continuously
[8586.90s -> 8590.90s]  in a row. As long as I can get a decent one I'll be fine. No sign of a cheetah.
[8590.90s -> 8599.60s]  You try to spot a cheetah using the binoculars.
[8599.60s -> 8613.41s]  Okay. I'm just gonna drive through the animals.
[8613.41s -> 8624.37s]  I don't see a cheetah. I don't even need to use the binoculars. This is Star Wars music.
[8624.37s -> 8635.52s]  It is. You're right. It is Star Wars music. This is specifically like
[8635.52s -> 8639.96s]  Obi-Wan. The crescendo of this is every time
[8639.96s -> 8643.96s]  Obi-Wan does a gigantic force front flip or back flip
[8643.96s -> 8648.32s]  onto another ledge. I'll give you an example here.
[8648.32s -> 8652.32s]  There he goes. He swings the lightsaber.
[8652.32s -> 8656.32s]  There's the back flip. Up. Maybe two levels above the enemy.
[8656.32s -> 8660.32s]  And he stays there and looks down and turns his lightsaber off.
[8660.32s -> 8664.63s]  And then turns around and he goes down another direction. So it's always a back flip or a front flip.
[8664.63s -> 8686.45s]  I just wanna look for a fucking cheetah. What the fuck is this cheetah?
[8686.45s -> 8691.01s]  Cheetah! Oh aren't those... What?
[8691.01s -> 8697.92s]  That's a cheetah right there. Isn't that a cheetah? That's not a cheetah.
[8697.92s -> 8712.05s]  Cheetah. Oh look they're... Oh you're just saying the things that I point the camera at.
[8712.05s -> 8716.55s]  Found it! Cheetah! Cheetah! Cheetah! There it is.
[8716.55s -> 8723.46s]  Okay I gotta get ready. Alright set it up. I got one chance.
[8723.46s -> 8730.26s]  Can I bring this into Photoshop later and fuck with it or no? Looking up at prey on top of the anthill.
[8730.26s -> 8735.27s]  It might start a chase. Let's get closer.
[8735.27s -> 8742.32s]  It has its eyes on a Thompson's gazelle.
[8742.32s -> 8749.36s]  Because you can't really make sure you have enough photos left. I'll follow along
[8749.36s -> 8760.71s]  Let's try when the cheetah starts running. Get that perfect shot.
[8760.71s -> 8765.01s]  Big game number one. Snap a cheetah hunting. Is the camera gonna already be open?
[8765.01s -> 8774.24s]  I only have like three seconds to get this correct.
[8774.24s -> 8782.96s]  This is not the cutscene anymore. Where is he? Where's the cheetah?
[8782.96s -> 8819.06s]  What are you doing? Oh! Look at that one.
[8819.06s -> 8828.90s]  You really have to do that? Is he three times?
[8828.90s -> 8833.91s]  That is not the best one. That's not the best one.
[8833.91s -> 8841.99s]  Looks like they're doing a conga line. This one sucks.
[8841.99s -> 8848.34s]  That was one fantastic hunt. You must have gotten some great photos.
[8848.34s -> 8858.77s]  There's no blood. Now this game was to
[8858.77s -> 8873.38s]  educate children how to use cameras. Specifically from Sony.
[8873.38s -> 8877.56s]  Got it. Ready to go home. Now if you see
[8877.56s -> 8882.93s]  a zebra, stop the car.
[8882.93s -> 8891.01s]  So I can get that too. Where are all the explosions?
[8891.01s -> 8898.12s]  This game is bullshit. Where are the fucking TIE fighters?
[8898.12s -> 8908.16s]  Zebras? I'm never gonna get that close with a zebra's face.
[8908.16s -> 8915.46s]  Put on different music. I can't put on custom music.
[8915.46s -> 8921.99s]  No! We have to deal with the same Star Wars track
[8921.99s -> 8926.29s]  over and over again. You're just watching your favorite scene.
[8926.29s -> 8930.29s]  You're watching the General Grievous scene over and over again.
[8930.29s -> 8935.81s]  In fact, I think he does it in the General Grievous scene.
[8935.81s -> 8956.04s]  No, it actually happens in that scene. Let's see.
[8956.04s -> 8960.04s]  It's not gonna be a copyright problem. Don't worry. I just need to get to the one part that I think is gonna happen.
[8960.04s -> 8973.08s]  Give me a sec. Let's get it on screen.
[8973.08s -> 8990.40s]  And here it comes.
[8990.40s -> 8995.22s]  Where is it? Come on. He jumps down. Does he jump
[8995.22s -> 9000.79s]  up? Why is this big backflip that he does up? I know
[9000.79s -> 9015.19s]  what happens. Here, look. I'll show you. You've never seen Star Wars before
[9015.19s -> 9025.56s]  than just fucking whatever.
[9029.56s -> 9035.14s]  No, no. I can't play this. I gotta stop this now. Stop.
[9035.14s -> 9053.06s]  No, no. That was less than ten seconds. Okay, hold on. Where's the jump? Update your
[9053.06s -> 9078.32s]  mic. Here it comes. Here we go.
[9078.32s -> 9106.42s]  I'm not gonna get in trouble. That was like five seconds.
[9106.42s -> 9120.82s]  I sorta fucking sneeze of the movie. We were looking for when he jumps
[9120.82s -> 9127.16s]  backwards or forwards and he jumps forwards. I'm not gonna get in trouble.
[9127.16s -> 9132.36s]  I showed fucking four seconds of a movie that came out like forty years ago.
[9132.36s -> 9140.82s]  Twenty years ago. There are people that like stream
[9140.82s -> 9147.94s]  all the Harry fucking Potter movies on Twitch. I don't think we have to be
[9147.94s -> 9155.96s]  concerned about like eight seconds. Like you can find like
[9155.96s -> 9159.96s]  whole fucking movie streams. Like super illegal movie streams.
[9159.96s -> 9169.73s]  Watching like all the Lord of the Rings. Let's see what we got.
[9169.73s -> 9182.79s]  Your best shot. Really? The one. Let's reply.
[9182.79s -> 9188.12s]  Which one? How is that not a good shot? This is great.
[9188.12s -> 9198.87s]  This is like showing the kill. Doesn't really fell over.
[9198.87s -> 9216.15s]  That one's good. Apparently they think it's this one. The first one.
[9216.15s -> 9224.29s]  I guess is the better one. He was then laid a band from Twitch.
[9224.29s -> 9231.16s]  For those four seconds of copyright material. We're gonna use this one. This is the one
[9231.16s -> 9242.05s]  that the video game is determined is the best one so I'm gonna use it.
[9242.05s -> 9253.25s]  That's pretty good. Yeah we got the algorithm in our favor.
[9253.25s -> 9259.80s]  I still need to do this one. I got a lot of money. I should buy something.
[9259.80s -> 9263.80s]  I'm just hoarding all of my cash right now. For no reason.
[9263.80s -> 9276.66s]  Unless eventually I can buy something better. But what does this frame do?
[9276.66s -> 9285.38s]  Put the, say for a ten foot lens.
[9285.38s -> 9290.64s]  I mean we could. What did the client think about the photo you sent them, Princey?
[9290.64s -> 9297.70s]  Well we crossed a milestone in our survey. We should get some rest.
[9298.70s -> 9319.10s]  Alright, hold on, hold on. I'm buying it.
[9319.10s -> 9346.36s]  I hung up the photo frame in the back. Perfect!
[9346.36s -> 9353.36s]  Let's see what the new task is. Sending map of new research area.
[9353.36s -> 9359.07s]  We have taken a detailed map of the wetlands adjacent to the Duma step.
[9359.07s -> 9363.07s]  In the area they refer to them as the Kiboko Swamp.
[9363.07s -> 9367.07s]  The rich water supply draws a number of animal inhabitants.
[9367.07s -> 9371.07s]  Especially those who thrive along the water's edge. Please focus your efforts in this new area starting today.
[9371.07s -> 9380.54s]  I'm literally turning, I'm getting, I'm like sixty.
[9380.54s -> 9384.54s]  I used to never have to have this problem.
[9384.54s -> 9391.53s]  When you get like a little older, it shit just happens man. I can't, I just, I'm old.
[9391.53s -> 9397.12s]  I'm getting older. You ever listen to the noises your fucking grandfather makes?
[9397.12s -> 9401.42s]  When he's just sitting there?
[9401.42s -> 9405.42s]  He's got like his hands together and he's just got his thumbs down and he's just like sitting there just relaxing.
[9405.42s -> 9409.42s]  And all of a sudden he just goes like...
[9409.42s -> 9418.59s]  I don't know what that's like. I get it now.
[9418.59s -> 9424.92s]  Sometimes I'll just be like...
[9424.92s -> 9432.03s]  I understand.
[9432.03s -> 9436.91s]  Please focus your efforts on this new area starting today.
[9436.91s -> 9443.71s]  Wait actually, I can send an email to Cheetah.
[9443.71s -> 9450.67s]  Any new animal is just three thousand dollars. Let's get a good one here of the Cheetah.
[9450.67s -> 9455.98s]  No, no. What the hell is that?
[9455.98s -> 9464.89s]  That's good. That's a good photo, but it's not of a Cheetah.
[9464.89s -> 9473.53s]  Unfortunately I have to use one of the ones.
[9473.53s -> 9477.53s]  One of these ones here. Like this one.
[9477.53s -> 9482.52s]  This one's probably good. Or that one. I'll do this one.
[9482.52s -> 9494.86s]  Framing's pretty terrible, but whatever. I'm gonna get the money anyway. Nevermind.
[9494.86s -> 9500.24s]  Alright, it's time to explore the wetlands. I can join you in the field starting today.
[9500.24s -> 9509.26s]  It took you like five days. Let's head to the swamp.
[9509.26s -> 9514.78s]  A zoomer streamer pukes on keyboard. Am I not a zoomer?
[9514.78s -> 9526.49s]  I'm not a boomer either. I am a
[9526.49s -> 9543.90s]  millennial. He's a zoom beanie.
[9543.90s -> 9547.90s]  I'll drive us to the Kiboko Swamp.
[9547.90s -> 9554.57s]  Francine, you just take the backseat and enjoy the sights.
[9554.57s -> 9567.13s]  Where's James? You drive like shit. Can I please bring James back?
[9567.13s -> 9587.10s]  We gotta go back and change some shit here. Enjoy the sights.
[9587.10s -> 9594.14s]  I wonder if I can get some cool shots here.
[9594.14s -> 9606.44s]  Just in case something crazy happens.
[9606.44s -> 9614.01s]  Is this that Vive game he was talking about? No, the reason I didn't do Vive today is because
[9614.01s -> 9618.01s]  I did not know if I was even going to be able to stream.
[9618.01s -> 9622.88s]  I didn't want to have a scenario where I can turn the stream on and the internet's
[9622.88s -> 9626.88s]  still fucked up. But I'm like all set up in a Vive VR room.
[9626.88s -> 9630.88s]  And the stream goes down in like 45 minutes.
[9630.88s -> 9636.89s]  I figure I would do this today and then do the Vive
[9636.89s -> 9640.89s]  hopefully tomorrow if his internet still works. I don't know. It's going to be tough
[9640.89s -> 9644.89s]  because it seems that we're having other issues too with
[9644.89s -> 9648.89s]  how our bandwidth is being split between
[9648.89s -> 9652.89s]  because Italics is here as well. So it's almost like we have two computers running
[9652.89s -> 9656.89s]  at the same time. One just can kill the other now.
[9656.89s -> 9660.89s]  So I don't know why. So I don't know. We might have to do a situation where
[9660.89s -> 9664.89s]  we try to take turns using the broken internet.
[9664.89s -> 9674.38s]  We'll have to figure that out. Hopefully it just works because it seems to be working now.
[9674.38s -> 9678.62s]  I thought that was a Twitch logo.
[9678.62s -> 9682.62s]  I think he tried to do something on the internet and that's
[9682.62s -> 9687.76s]  when we dropped like a thousand, two thousand frames. Weird. I don't know.
[9687.76s -> 9691.76s]  I can't explain it. The map from the head office indicates that Keeq Boko Swamp
[9691.76s -> 9707.96s]  lies this way. Let's go. And it's definitely not a problem with any of our
[9707.96s -> 9712.72s]  equipment because we've had the same shit for four months.
[9712.72s -> 9717.77s]  And we haven't really had a problem that we had to deal with this before.
[9717.77s -> 9721.77s]  All this shit started three days ago when the whole internet just
[9721.77s -> 9726.91s]  cut off, turned off to zero. And then I was told by
[9726.91s -> 9730.91s]  people at Cox that we have like a packet loss problem
[9730.91s -> 9734.91s]  and they were going to fix it and they were going to work on it. I don't know. Maybe they're still doing that.
[9734.91s -> 9738.91s]  We're getting some fallout from the weather maybe. I don't know.
[9738.91s -> 9742.91s]  We're just going to try. We're going to do what we can do. That's all we can do.
[9742.91s -> 9762.22s]  All right. What an incredible sight we're at the swamp.
[9762.22s -> 9767.08s]  That's a nice photo. That photo was terrible but that was a nice looking photo.
[9767.08s -> 9781.74s]  Any other animals in the swamp?
[9781.74s -> 9791.42s]  Eric follows the GPS into a lake.
[9791.42s -> 9797.07s]  That climbing shrub is called a water tree.
[9797.07s -> 9801.88s]  That tree looks like an easy one to climb. We're going to climb the tree.
[9801.88s -> 9809.90s]  Climb a tree to conceal yourself from the animals.
[9809.90s -> 9822.12s]  I'm not going to get the equipment to go up here. I'm just going to drive by it.
[9822.12s -> 9827.32s]  See Francine, this right here is a lake. It's a swamp.
[9827.32s -> 9831.32s]  The swamp is much larger than I expected. Why don't you take the wheel from here?
[9831.32s -> 9836.70s]  Why don't I take the wheel from here? What? I have to drive the car now.
[9836.70s -> 9849.63s]  How do I drive it? Just went up a whole letter grid.
[9849.63s -> 9855.34s]  What do you want me to do? Can I dump them?
[9855.34s -> 9868.22s]  What do you want me to do? Take the wheel to do what?
[9868.22s -> 9879.42s]  I can't take any pictures. Look, I could have gotten those swans.
[9879.42s -> 9894.01s]  I'm going to climb the tree?
[9894.01s -> 9905.04s]  This looks like a battery powered toy car.
[9905.04s -> 9911.32s]  It does look like a power wheel. What the fuck am I looking for?
[9924.19s -> 9945.36s]  I'm just up on a tree. What are we doing this for?
[9945.36s -> 9953.61s]  Here we go. Fly right down into me.
[9953.61s -> 9965.39s]  Fly down, down, down, down, right into me.
[9965.39s -> 9974.14s]  Not terrible. A lot of birds.
[9974.14s -> 10000.33s]  These photos are not very good.
[10000.33s -> 10026.06s]  Let me take a look at that one. That might be the best photo I've taken.
[10026.06s -> 10030.06s]  It was a snap. Look at the background.
[10030.06s -> 10034.56s]  Look at his wings are a little bit out of focus. What his beak is.
[10034.56s -> 10047.61s]  Great photo. What about all the birds?
[10047.61s -> 10057.26s]  I think there's more than one.
[10057.26s -> 10063.10s]  Take a selfie. Selfies didn't exist.
[10063.10s -> 10067.10s]  This game came out in 2008. Selfies were not a thing that made any sense.
[10067.10s -> 10081.24s]  Selfies did not exist.
[10081.24s -> 10098.40s]  There was no picture camera that you could hold in your hand and turn that way.
[10098.40s -> 10116.44s]  I can get closer than that. Just T-Posed.
[10116.44s -> 10166.62s]  Right here. Slow down.
[10166.62s -> 10181.79s]  Right there. That's the one.
[10181.79s -> 10231.88s]  I had it. It was close.
[10231.88s -> 10236.96s]  Eric! Eric!
[10236.96s -> 10242.84s]  Where's Eric? Where's the car?
[10242.84s -> 10274.46s]  No! Do I get to keep my photos?
[10274.46s -> 10290.33s]  That picture of the
[10290.33s -> 10294.83s]  bird is gone.
[10294.83s -> 10302.46s]  That was the best picture I've ever taken.
[10302.46s -> 10306.46s]  Camping tent. Spend the night in the field and get an early start the next morning. An outdoorsman's best friend.
[10306.46s -> 10318.68s]  That sucks. That actually sucks.
[10318.68s -> 10347.02s]  I'm going to buy it. Let's get the tent. Why does the buffalo wipe the camera?
[10347.02s -> 10352.22s]  I don't know. I'm so disappointed right now.
[10352.22s -> 10367.96s]  Why would Eric save the photographer and not the photos?
[10367.96s -> 10382.94s]  At the end of the day, I matter not the footage.
[10382.94s -> 10387.24s]  Buffalo took the SD card. No, I think it's what it's implied.
[10387.24s -> 10394.92s]  Because your camera gets stomped. Those are some good photos too.
[10394.92s -> 10414.38s]  What? Why?
[10414.38s -> 10418.81s]  We've got to go back to the wetlands. I need to go explore and take some good photos.
[10418.81s -> 10425.42s]  Go get revenge. What? Go run over the buffalo.
[10425.42s -> 10430.30s]  I've got to go get my SD card back.
[10430.30s -> 10439.64s]  We can't flip the car, right? Where is this heading?
[10439.64s -> 10464.86s]  This is a different zone too. Heading towards...
[10464.86s -> 10472.75s]  I've got to get my souls back. I'm glad I actually had to drive though.
[10472.75s -> 10494.12s]  That was annoying. Having to wait for someone to drive you around.
[10494.12s -> 10498.12s]  At what point does Eric start to say...
[10498.12s -> 10502.49s]  Watch out! Hey now, watch your driving!
[10502.49s -> 10507.44s]  There it is. Please don't do that.
[10507.44s -> 10511.44s]  That's Jay Leno, by the way.
[10511.44s -> 10524.99s]  I might as well put the chicken in my head around.
[10524.99s -> 10530.38s]  Let's find a place to stop. I can't believe I lost the picture.
[10530.38s -> 10534.38s]  The gull. The pelican.
[10534.38s -> 10538.38s]  Or the swan. Or the flamingo.
[10538.38s -> 10547.80s]  One of the birds have the weird long sock necks.
[10547.80s -> 10562.60s]  Get out of the car. Let's get a good one from far away.
[10562.60s -> 10570.09s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[10570.09s -> 10574.09s]  I've got to get closer, otherwise I have to drop the aperture.
[10574.09s -> 10587.90s]  That's one drinking right there.
[10587.90s -> 10602.30s]  I've got to get closer. Do not get fucking killed again over this.
[10602.30s -> 10607.69s]  Not bad. I've got the fucking photo I need.
[10607.69s -> 10627.53s]  What are you doing? That's too dark. He's going manual!
[10627.53s -> 10634.72s]  It's too dark. I'm not sticking around. I've got what I needed.
[10634.72s -> 10645.66s]  Now I've got to get a couple photos of...
[10645.66s -> 10650.99s]  Can I take a photo right now if the car has stopped? Or do I have to get out of the car?
[10650.99s -> 10658.28s]  This guy's not going to knock the Jeep over, is he?
[10658.28s -> 10666.62s]  I need to get the birds.
[10666.62s -> 10681.34s]  I'm so pissed off that I lost those.
[10681.34s -> 10685.34s]  Hey, is this the streamer that photographed a wild buffalo on manual?
[10685.34s -> 10701.10s]  Not yet. He has a driver's ed brake.
[10701.10s -> 10710.44s]  I think that's what's going on.
[10710.44s -> 10714.44s]  The head office hasn't sent us maps for this area yet.
[10714.44s -> 10723.04s]  I've got the buffalo. I need the flying birds. Can I climb these trees?
[10723.04s -> 10732.25s]  I'm going to take the fucking pictures all over again.
[10732.25s -> 10740.51s]  Let's get this back up.
[10740.51s -> 10748.96s]  The birds are going to be flying around. I need some good speed.
[10748.96s -> 10758.88s]  Climb tree. Can I only climb certain trees?
[10758.88s -> 10770.14s]  Is that what I'm missing here? I can't climb this?
[10770.14s -> 10788.17s]  I guess I can. Why the hell not?
[10788.17s -> 10795.16s]  What tree should I go to, then? What happened to the Jeep?
[10795.16s -> 10812.44s]  I was going to say, what? How does it camouflage?
[10812.44s -> 10824.99s]  Let's try the other tree. This one down here. The big ones, probably.
[10824.99s -> 10830.96s]  I did different gazelles.
[10830.96s -> 10835.32s]  I'm going to get up in that tree right there. That's a good spot.
[10835.32s -> 10854.01s]  Climb trees.
[10854.01s -> 10858.01s]  Can I not climb the tree unless he tells me to climb the tree?
[10858.01s -> 10864.68s]  Is there one tree I can get on? I don't think I can get on any tree but the one in the middle.
[10864.68s -> 10877.48s]  What about this one? I don't see a prompt or anything.
[10877.48s -> 10894.04s]  Nice FPS, bro!
[10894.04s -> 10915.85s]  There's a hole in that one.
[10915.85s -> 10926.88s]  I'm going in the tree.
[10926.88s -> 10936.78s]  Why am I doing this?
[10936.78s -> 10946.38s]  Do I live here now? Am I baiting somebody out?
[10946.38s -> 10960.44s]  I'm hiding here. What am I hiding from?
[10960.44s -> 10977.60s]  This one has horns. Gotta get closer.
[10977.60s -> 11035.45s]  Just in case you run away, let me get one. I'm just bored in this venue.
[11035.45s -> 11049.28s]  Some of those were good. Now I just need the bird.
[11049.28s -> 11069.10s]  Go get in the tree. That's why we shoot raw.
[11069.10s -> 11076.03s]  I really wish I had a picture of one of the gulls but I don't.
[11076.03s -> 11092.16s]  I can probably get a shitty picture of one of these birds.
[11092.16s -> 11096.16s]  I get it. I know, I know. You don't have to hold down the fucking instructor break.
[11096.16s -> 11102.70s]  Just get a zoom in.
[11102.70s -> 11109.74s]  It looks like shit. I don't even care. I just have to get them collected.
[11109.74s -> 11130.73s]  Whatever. I want to do another one of those cheetah missions. That was really cool.
[11130.73s -> 11139.88s]  The cheetah mission only gave you a certain amount of time.
[11139.88s -> 11146.24s]  What happened to the Star Wars music? That's true.
[11146.24s -> 11160.83s]  It kind of just disappeared. Why did the music disappear? I couldn't tell you.
[11160.83s -> 11177.53s]  I have no idea. That was music for James.
[11177.53s -> 11184.64s]  It took a long time to load that. Area secured, we got this one.
[11184.64s -> 11192.51s]  Back to the camp. I honestly don't even know where the camp is.
[11192.51s -> 11218.04s]  There it is. You don't get stuck like this. I don't even know where the save point was.
[11218.04s -> 11229.37s]  Get up there. This is really
[11229.37s -> 11237.56s]  electrical powered. Four by four.
[11237.56s -> 11251.40s]  Can we get out of the car? Hey, thanks. Whoa, somehow we pulled free.
[11251.40s -> 11256.86s]  Wow. Thank you World of Warcraft Game Master.
[11256.86s -> 11262.17s]  Appreciate that. Now I got stuck in Iron Forge again.
[11262.17s -> 11272.28s]  How do I go back to camp? It's starting to get dark.
[11272.28s -> 11276.83s]  Can we get out of the car? End. Okay, here we go.
[11276.83s -> 11288.48s]  End Safari. Oh my god. You can just teleport.
[11295.86s -> 11306.48s]  This is so bad. Which one's worse?
[11306.48s -> 11312.05s]  That's pretty good. That's not so good.
[11312.05s -> 11316.48s]  Neither is that. This one is good. That one's really good.
[11316.48s -> 11326.68s]  I'd say this is the one I'm going to send. I'm not looking for good scores, I just want to have the database.
[11326.68s -> 11333.41s]  So I get the mission to do it. There's a Pelican. I got it right.
[11333.41s -> 11356.20s]  That one's good. Three grand. I'll take it.
[11356.20s -> 11365.60s]  That's an Impala. What else we got? The buffaloes, right?
[11365.60s -> 11372.22s]  These are different. This is the male and female, right?
[11372.22s -> 11378.70s]  Oh, this is different. Bad angle. Why is this a bad angle?
[11378.70s -> 11395.79s]  We got the buffaloes. The one that's the most in focus is the one over there.
[11395.79s -> 11404.57s]  To the left. You can take this one.
[11404.57s -> 11420.00s]  African Buffalo. Are there any others? I don't think so.
[11420.00s -> 11424.24s]  I got the gull. I'm going to hold on to these though.
[11424.24s -> 11429.93s]  This one in particular. Get rid of the shitty ones.
[11429.93s -> 11434.43s]  Get rid of all the shitty buffalo ones. What is this? A bush.
[11434.43s -> 11439.16s]  Just get rid of this one too. Hold on to these ones because I like them.
[11439.16s -> 11449.04s]  Got to keep that one. And that looks good.
[11449.04s -> 11459.98s]  Alright. Go to bed. See if I actually have a mission tomorrow.
[11459.98s -> 11468.04s]  Check the email. There we go. Whoa, that's a lot.
[11468.04s -> 11472.28s]  Photo for nature power. Could you get a giraffe at eye level?
[11472.28s -> 11479.07s]  What? How are you tree climbing skills? I've got a job for you.
[11479.07s -> 11483.07s]  I need a close up of a giraffe's face, but not just any close up. I kind of
[11483.07s -> 11487.07s]  promised my boss I'd get him a shot taken from tree level. Can you bail me out?
[11487.07s -> 11493.79s]  If I can climb a tree, maybe. Hello Francine.
[11493.79s -> 11497.79s]  My name is Javi Salgado and I represent NINP Publishing.
[11497.79s -> 11501.79s]  It's a pleasure to meet you. We plan to introduce readers to the African Buffalo
[11501.79s -> 11505.79s]  in one of our upcoming magazines. You think you could provide a photo? Try and get as close to a
[11505.79s -> 11509.79s]  vicious buffalo as you can. We want a tense shot.
[11509.79s -> 11519.13s]  You saw what happened last time. You're familiar with an animal called the impala.
[11519.13s -> 11523.69s]  Each male is what you might call a player. He forms a harem
[11523.69s -> 11530.41s]  of multiple females.
[11530.41s -> 11534.41s]  Photograph one of these harems. Look for the male's magnificent horns and please
[11534.41s -> 11538.84s]  make sure both male and female are in frame. What's this for?
[11538.84s -> 11546.28s]  Am I just going to send this to this guy? Oh hey, can you show that? That's for me.
[11546.28s -> 11555.69s]  It doesn't say what it's for. Yeah, there's no official reason
[11555.69s -> 11562.41s]  for these photos. Okay, well whatever.
[11562.41s -> 11569.53s]  A giraffe at eye level is more interesting. I'm going to take this one first. And then we're looking for
[11569.53s -> 11573.53s]  what we can get that. We still need a close up of a zebra's face.
[11573.53s -> 11577.53s]  I don't think we're going to get that though. Let me get this.
[11577.53s -> 11599.55s]  Find a tree we can climb. Well, interestingly enough,
[11599.55s -> 11606.08s]  I think the internet has been incredibly stable. So cross your
[11606.08s -> 11611.26s]  fingers that today's test stream
[11611.26s -> 11621.90s]  can carry us into tomorrow and the next day. Hopefully.
[11621.90s -> 11625.90s]  I wasn't even going to stream today. I was going to just not do it.
[11625.90s -> 11636.16s]  It looks like we might be good to go. Who just drove in front of my car?
[11636.16s -> 11652.03s]  Oh my god. Why are you doing this to me?
[11652.03s -> 11656.03s]  You thought this was going to be a transition into five? Well, I can't really do that right now.
[11656.03s -> 11660.59s]  Because I have to set the room up again. I had to bring all my
[11660.59s -> 11664.59s]  shit back in here until I sit down at my desk. That's...
[11664.59s -> 11671.32s]  This is not going to happen tonight. Tonight was really just to make sure that the stream
[11671.32s -> 11677.42s]  could be on for more than two or three hours. Like I got to set up my lighthouses back here again.
[11677.42s -> 11689.28s]  Yeah, Vive is a total commitment. And I have to be certain
[11689.28s -> 11697.28s]  that it's possible too. I need a tree. Because once I go in
[11697.28s -> 11701.58s]  that thing, I had a conversation with a talc about it earlier today.
[11701.58s -> 11705.58s]  It's like, oh, am I going to stream Vive today? Well, maybe the internet might not work.
[11705.58s -> 11710.01s]  I have to fucking take a gigantic robot outfit and
[11710.01s -> 11714.01s]  put lighthouses all over my room and the stream turns off in 45 minutes.
[11714.01s -> 11719.47s]  I'm just going to be like, well, that was fucking dumb. Can I even climb this tree?
[11719.47s -> 11730.75s]  Let me just make sure I can climb the trees here. How do you determine if you can climb
[11730.75s -> 11739.64s]  a tree? Yeah, I saw there was tons of recommendations
[11739.64s -> 11744.65s]  for VR. There's so many things to do.
[11744.65s -> 11748.65s]  It's actually kind of overwhelming how many fucking Vive games there are
[11748.65s -> 11766.33s]  that I haven't played. Mind Show is the number one.
[11766.33s -> 11772.22s]  And I'm not even certain I'm going to do that tomorrow. Or the next day,
[11772.22s -> 11787.72s]  depending again on how this internet works out.
[11787.72s -> 11797.98s]  Where are the giraffes? I gotta go to like a pool somewhere.
[11797.98s -> 11804.33s]  If you don't know what Mind Show is, Mind Show is a VR game.
[11804.33s -> 11808.33s]  It's not really a game, it's more of an experience. Where you
[11808.33s -> 11812.33s]  get into the VR shit
[11812.33s -> 11816.33s]  and you make scenes and make your own movie. TV show
[11816.33s -> 11820.76s]  skit thing. It's very much like you control
[11820.76s -> 11825.90s]  the movies in a way, the sets,
[11825.90s -> 11830.84s]  the set pieces. I'm really looking forward to it. Alright, here we go.
[11830.84s -> 11842.68s]  That's a tree I can get in. There's a
[11842.68s -> 11848.52s]  microphone built into the Vive too, which I didn't even know. So that's going to be
[11848.52s -> 11854.04s]  really interesting. Alright, stop freaking out, I'm fine.
[11854.04s -> 11858.04s]  No, no, no, no, don't run away. I just need to get your eye level in your face. This one didn't
[11858.04s -> 11863.05s]  run. This one didn't run. The Vive mic sucks.
[11863.05s -> 11868.38s]  Yeah, but it might be fun to use it. Because my microphone setup is really
[11868.38s -> 11872.38s]  not like the best in regards to standing in a room.
[11872.38s -> 11882.75s]  Can you tell me I can't get in this tree? I can definitely get on this tree. I have
[11882.75s -> 11903.42s]  to be able to. Look at this, it's perfect. Alright, what the hell was that?
[11903.42s -> 11910.16s]  How am I going to get this? I gotta be right in their face?
[11910.16s -> 11923.15s]  This is not like right in their face. He's got to get much closer. Just throw
[11923.15s -> 11932.75s]  the camera. God damn it, turn around. I wonder if they'll come over to the tree and eat.
[11932.75s -> 11940.75s]  Get the zebra picture too.
[11940.75s -> 11949.18s]  Yeah, I'm trying to be as prepared as possible.
[11949.18s -> 11953.74s]  Because I know there's a lot of things that can go wrong
[11953.74s -> 11957.74s]  in VR streaming. So I'm making sure to make sure
[11957.74s -> 11962.49s]  the room is set up completely perfect. The games I'll have
[11962.49s -> 11971.34s]  work. I'm just fucking happy the internet works.
[11971.34s -> 11981.34s]  I have to have patience now. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No, I don't.
[11981.34s -> 11985.77s]  You just turn your head this way.
[11985.77s -> 12003.32s]  That should be alright. Turn this way. Come on, turn your head this way. Do it.
[12003.32s -> 12026.00s]  No, my fucking zoom. He's coming this way. Turn,
[12026.00s -> 12048.51s]  turn, turn your head. I think I got it. Let's take a look.
[12048.51s -> 12056.00s]  I didn't have time to mess with settings there. I had to go to auto.
[12056.00s -> 12061.12s]  Here it is. It could be that one though. That one's good too.
[12061.12s -> 12073.02s]  It's probably this one. Or this one.
[12073.02s -> 12078.48s]  I should have done vertical. Yeah, shit, you're right. I'm going to stay here.
[12078.48s -> 12088.91s]  He'll come back. I always use manual. Well, I got a real camera.
[12088.91s -> 12113.68s]  Not a video game camera. Let's try it again.
[12113.68s -> 12117.68s]  I do realize now this stream is just me taking photos of animals. Look at that one.
[12117.68s -> 12134.70s]  You get the little one and you get the big one. Opportunity here. Hold on.
[12134.70s -> 12146.80s]  Stay there. No, you idiot. You just ruined the whole thing.
[12146.80s -> 12154.41s]  This would have been so cute. Go. Move. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[12154.41s -> 12164.73s]  It's off. It's all fucked up. Doesn't matter.
[12164.73s -> 12171.15s]  I could have got his face. Please move out of the way so I can get this. I'm going to have to crop you out.
[12171.15s -> 12177.16s]  Nice. Nice work. Thanks a lot.
[12177.16s -> 12185.61s]  Do what you want. Go over there. Dickhead. Do that on purpose.
[12185.61s -> 12190.30s]  No, no, no. Wait. Stop. Stop. This is perfect. Go to auto. I don't care.
[12190.30s -> 12204.25s]  No black and white. This is the one.
[12204.25s -> 12219.15s]  Turn. Turn. Turn your head. Turn your head this way.
[12219.15s -> 12225.31s]  Oh, it's not good.
[12225.31s -> 12249.18s]  It was close, but not great. Maybe you'll do it.
[12249.18s -> 12258.86s]  One. I'm going to turn up the... hold on. Because he's going to turn his head
[12258.86s -> 12263.48s]  and I'm going to get it right when he turns. It's not going to be blurry.
[12263.48s -> 12267.48s]  Watch this. He's going to turn and I'm going to get it right when he's mid-turned. Get the camera right here.
[12267.48s -> 12271.48s]  Snap it when he gets out.
[12271.48s -> 12282.83s]  He's basically going to cross the plane here. Why is this black and white? What the fuck?
[12282.83s -> 12301.77s]  I didn't do that. Turn slightly.
[12301.77s -> 12308.75s]  You went the wrong way. God damn it. If he had turned this way.
[12308.75s -> 12314.52s]  Look, it's like you're riding him. I got it. I got it. I think this one's fine.
[12314.52s -> 12335.71s]  Let me just... I got a secret bird.
[12335.71s -> 12348.94s]  This is a secret bird any day. I like that one. Secret bird.
[12348.94s -> 12354.44s]  See how cute that would have been if I had that framed up and all three of them were there.
[12354.44s -> 12358.94s]  That would have been such a great picture. Thank the dumb zebra that screwed it all up.
[12358.94s -> 12365.74s]  Somebody just gave me $100.
[12365.74s -> 12371.26s]  100 bucks. Cyclops Parker, thanks for the $100.
[12371.26s -> 12378.36s]  10,000 bits. Shit load.
[12378.36s -> 12382.36s]  They say, hey Jeremy, I've been watching you for years now, but I can rarely catch the streams live.
[12382.36s -> 12386.60s]  To be here, just wanted to help keep you doing what you do.
[12386.60s -> 12393.08s]  Thank you so much, Cyclops Parker. That's fucking incredible. Thank you.
[12393.08s -> 12397.84s]  If you can't catch it, as long as, you know, if you want to
[12397.84s -> 12402.59s]  jump in when you can, and you feel like being here, that's...
[12402.59s -> 12407.53s]  You're not under any obligation to come to every stream, but I really appreciate it.
[12407.53s -> 12414.38s]  If you come here and you're happy, that's fucking awesome. Thanks for stopping in.
[12414.38s -> 12428.14s]  And thank you for the $100. So I got that photo.
[12428.14s -> 12432.14s]  It's covering the fees. No, no, that's incredibly fucking generous
[12432.14s -> 12436.14s]  and nice of anybody to give that much money, or even any amount of money.
[12436.14s -> 12444.27s]  So, thank you. Do I have another opportunity for a fucking secret bird?
[12444.27s -> 12449.15s]  Did you see that? I missed it. I want to get a close-up
[12449.15s -> 12485.63s]  of that bird. Oh, I'll get you, motherfucker. Just you wait.
[12485.63s -> 12493.77s]  I would have had three there. This is just so relaxing. Why don't they make another one
[12493.77s -> 12501.79s]  of these, somebody? Make like an incredibly detailed version of this.
[12501.79s -> 12508.91s]  Just go do it in real life. I can't do this.
[12508.91s -> 12514.36s]  A VR game where you do this. Does that exist? If it does,
[12514.36s -> 12518.36s]  I'm gonna play it. All right, here we go. There's another opportunity for a
[12518.36s -> 12529.44s]  decent one. Damn it. I'm gonna run into
[12529.44s -> 12533.44s]  the photos here, if I'm not careful. I got it, I got it, I got it. Let's get the zebra face.
[12533.44s -> 12548.54s]  And then move on. German spells too bad to do this. What the hell are you talking about?
[12548.54s -> 12554.83s]  I don't know if that's gonna fly here. I don't know if that's gonna work.
[12554.83s -> 12562.68s]  Closer? How close can I get? Don't overdo it.
[12562.68s -> 12575.80s]  No, no, no, no, no, no. Drop that, drop that, drop that, drop that.
[12575.80s -> 12579.98s]  And when I say drop it, I mean raise it. Are you gonna walk forward?
[12579.98s -> 12587.47s]  I'll get this on auto. Oh, great. I think that's gonna be fine.
[12587.47s -> 12598.62s]  That'll be worth it, I think. Let's get out of here.
[12598.62s -> 12606.19s]  Got the giraffe, I got his face. Let's go. Back to base camp.
[12606.19s -> 12613.69s]  Apparently there's first person too. I just figured that out right now. Somehow.
[12613.69s -> 12627.31s]  Let's see, transfer the photos in. Some good ones.
[12627.31s -> 12632.49s]  Alright, giraffe at eye level. I don't have a lens that's good
[12632.49s -> 12637.04s]  enough to do this, but it's close enough. It's this one right here, right?
[12637.04s -> 12642.65s]  Yeah, that's eye level. Loving Fox
[12642.65s -> 12658.91s]  just gave six community subs. Thank you, Loving Fox. Thank you for the
[12658.91s -> 12663.53s]  six. How is that target not more than great?
[12663.53s -> 12672.86s]  Because his head is tilted a little too much, apparently.
[12672.86s -> 12683.29s]  Now, here we go. Is this good enough? I don't know, like
[12683.29s -> 12702.60s]  that's as best as I'm gonna get with this lens. Really?
[12702.60s -> 12707.74s]  Okay. This one is the, get a close up of an African
[12707.74s -> 12712.11s]  buffalo. Try and get as close to a vicious buffalo as you can with looking for a dynamic
[12712.11s -> 12716.11s]  really tense shot. I gotta know where the car is.
[12716.11s -> 12725.92s]  The car is gonna be right behind me. And this one is already here. Wait,
[12725.92s -> 12736.80s]  secret bird. Bingo. Is there a better one?
[12736.80s -> 12754.46s]  That's pretty good. The superb starling adult.
[12754.46s -> 12767.32s]  Alright, let's go get killed by a buffalo. Use the brushes cover.
[12767.32s -> 12771.63s]  Can I just do it now? No, I gotta go to bed.
[12771.63s -> 12783.34s]  I love the plane sound effect when you email pictures.
[12783.34s -> 12788.78s]  We might have more to do though, let's see.
[12788.78s -> 12800.56s]  Where's the wall here? Play another game.
[12800.56s -> 12805.48s]  This is the plan. This is the game that I wanted to play for a little while.
[12805.48s -> 12819.39s]  I'm just hanging out and playing it. We are on the PlayStation 3, so even if there was
[12819.39s -> 12823.82s]  something else I wanted to do, I would have to kind of set up
[12823.82s -> 12829.47s]  something else and not capture my PlayStation 3.
[12829.47s -> 12833.47s]  And there's nothing really that's ready to go right this second, because remember, I didn't even know the stream was gonna happen today.
[12833.47s -> 12837.47s]  So I knew that I had this game, and that if I could stream I was
[12837.47s -> 12842.60s]  gonna try it. So this stream was not really supposed to happen.
[12842.60s -> 12846.60s]  But I'm so glad it did, because now I know that the internet works.
[12846.60s -> 12864.59s]  And I'm stuck.
[12864.59s -> 12868.59s]  I just want people to be aware that's why I'm just playing a
[12868.59s -> 12875.13s]  take photos of animals safari game.
[12875.13s -> 12879.13s]  There's a lot of vibe shit to do, but like I said before, I just want to make sure that I'm able to
[12879.13s -> 12888.60s]  stay alive for more than 5 fucking hours.
[12888.60s -> 12896.24s]  What happened there? Alright, tense buffalo close up of a buffalo's angry face.
[12896.24s -> 12900.24s]  Is it possible to roll the car? No, you can't roll the car and you can't run over any animals.
[12900.24s -> 12907.10s]  Sorry everybody. I don't know why I have to apologize for that.
[12907.10s -> 12914.92s]  That should be like, oh that's good that you can't do that. I gotta pick a beeline for the car.
[12914.92s -> 12929.45s]  After getting this picture. After we get this photo though, there's probably gonna be another
[12929.45s -> 12938.30s]  super mission. I'm glad you can't hurt the animals. That's what I was saying.
[12938.30s -> 12942.60s]  I wasn't saying I'm sad that I can't run them over.
[12942.60s -> 12954.72s]  This is a pretty good sit on the couch and have your mouth open game though.
[12954.72s -> 12968.28s]  It definitely is. I would play this game
[12968.28s -> 12974.06s]  with like a niece or a nephew and be like, oh can you, I don't see, do you see the buffaloes
[12974.06s -> 12978.75s]  anywhere? Right there! Oh you're right, you're right, yeah!
[12978.75s -> 12996.48s]  Should we go take a photo? He's a boomer uncle.
[12996.48s -> 13000.48s]  What's wrong with that? What's wrong with being like an uncle? That's not a problem.
[13000.48s -> 13024.91s]  That kinda hurt my head. Anything that's like boomer
[13024.91s -> 13029.66s]  to a lot of you guys apparently. How do I not be
[13029.66s -> 13034.48s]  like a quote boomer? What if I told you guys I eat like candy?
[13034.48s -> 13038.48s]  Okay, so if I ate a bunch of candy it was in the first grade, why
[13038.48s -> 13059.40s]  would I still be a boomer? Yes. You were born in 1985.
[13059.40s -> 13068.96s]  I know, but what if I wasn't? I went to the
[13068.96s -> 13073.84s]  dentist today. What a boomer. Teeth health is a boomer thing?
[13073.84s -> 13093.68s]  Where the fuck are these buffaloes? What kind of question is that?
[13093.68s -> 13104.49s]  Where did it go? Oh!
[13104.49s -> 13109.80s]  Okay, come here. Those are elephants. I found elephants.
[13109.80s -> 13113.80s]  They just woke the fuck up now. Hey, if you're watching and you were like kind of drifting off
[13113.80s -> 13117.80s]  and like hanging out and not excited about this scream because it's just kind of a chill scream.
[13117.80s -> 13140.65s]  Wake! Wake up! Time to get up!
[13140.65s -> 13162.48s]  Never mind, go back to bed. Sorry I woke you up for that.
[13162.48s -> 13166.48s]  That bunch of people probably did just like wake up from just like taking, they kind of drifted off.
[13166.48s -> 13170.48s]  It was an invisible wall to hide the elephants apparently.
[13170.48s -> 13180.08s]  Well, I got photos of them.
[13180.08s -> 13190.40s]  I thought they were buffalo at first. Well, that's like the edge of the universe right there.
[13190.40s -> 13204.72s]  The edge of the universe. Stop. No, no.
[13204.72s -> 13210.56s]  Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay. Not fast enough. Hold on.
[13210.56s -> 13222.76s]  They're gonna land. Right here. Fuck. I gotta get a good
[13222.76s -> 13254.57s]  swampy moss photo with some red eyes.
[13254.57s -> 13263.04s]  Whatever. Oh, you keep coming in right when I stop doing that.
[13263.04s -> 13271.74s]  Whatever. I'll never get the perfect photo again.
[13277.65s -> 13285.84s]  Turn. Is someone coming in? I have to stay in the same spot.
[13285.84s -> 13293.60s]  This guy's gonna turn around and fly back overhead. Yeah, I'm fishing for shots. It sucks.
[13293.60s -> 13299.19s]  You have to let the wildlife come to you. You can't go to the wildlife.
[13299.19s -> 13305.46s]  Eventually just aim your camera out your window. Eventually a rhino will
[13305.46s -> 13320.44s]  walk by. You have to do it for a long time. Come on.
[13320.44s -> 13327.60s]  Somebody turn. We got one coming in right here, don't we? Did it turn? I don't think so.
[13327.60s -> 13338.42s]  No, they're all flying this way. Hold on. I'm in a bad place.
[13338.42s -> 13361.19s]  Bad spot. God damn it. Wait. I don't even know what that is.
[13361.19s -> 13369.83s]  Let me find them. Let me do the mission at hand here. Let's find the
[13369.83s -> 13380.60s]  buffalo. Chad has voted to adjust Jerma's height to
[13380.60s -> 13390.98s]  three feet. I love how that's an adjustment.
[13390.98s -> 13395.41s]  That's an adjustment. Alright, here we go. We need an aggressive shot. Keep the
[13395.41s -> 13400.68s]  engine running. Here we go. He's gonna turn around and run directly behind me.
[13400.68s -> 13415.78s]  An angry face. Okay. Get close enough.
[13415.78s -> 13421.94s]  He's gonna get close. Wait till he gets closer.
[13421.94s -> 13434.31s]  Okay, hold on. Not tense enough. He needs to be angry.
[13434.31s -> 13450.56s]  Okay, here we go. Ready? One. Holy fuck.
[13450.56s -> 13463.24s]  That's a great one. Get in the car. Oh, that was good.
[13463.24s -> 13473.28s]  Get me out of here. I gotta take a look at that one.
[13473.28s -> 13489.92s]  That's gotta be worth some money. This thing was about to kill me.
[13489.92s -> 13500.69s]  That was a great one. I said that really fucking weirdly. I wanna hear how I said that.
[13500.69s -> 13508.84s]  That was really strange. Okay, here we go. Ready? One.
[13508.84s -> 13516.71s]  Holy fuck. That's a great one. I said that weird, right?
[13516.71s -> 13527.51s]  Something about that was off. I don't know why.
[13527.51s -> 13539.56s]  Alright, let's get out of here. Australian accent.
[13539.56s -> 13548.98s]  Fuck. That's a great one, Mike.
[13548.98s -> 13555.70s]  That is a good one, though. I tell you.
[13555.70s -> 13561.41s]  That's my normal voice.
[13561.41s -> 13571.84s]  If I sound like that? Take your photo. This better get in the magazine.
[13571.84s -> 13578.96s]  Marvelous. Marvelous. All marvelous.
[13578.96s -> 13582.96s]  That's bullshit. How would I get closer?
[13582.96s -> 13589.06s]  Are you trying to make this photographer die? How would you get closer than I did?
[13589.06s -> 13594.44s]  I was seconds away from being killed. That's not close enough, apparently.
[13594.44s -> 13602.71s]  Congratulations! Published in the magazine Nature Power.
[13602.71s -> 13607.52s]  Check the bookshelf to view your own published photos.
[13607.52s -> 13611.96s]  Nice. Okay, what about this one? We had a picture of elephants, right?
[13611.96s -> 13625.59s]  Some weird fucking bird. Who cares? Just give me the money.
[13625.59s -> 13629.59s]  For the record, that's a better photo than the almost-dying charging buffalo.
[13629.59s -> 13649.51s]  What else am I missing here?
[13649.51s -> 13660.34s]  Did I get these already? I don't think so. Yeah, I already had a picture of them.
[13660.34s -> 13665.78s]  I do have the distance elephants. This is such a bad photo
[13665.78s -> 13676.04s]  of elephants, but you know what? I just want the data.
[13676.04s -> 13684.31s]  The distance is terrible, but it's okay. African elephant, African elephant.
[13684.31s -> 13690.50s]  Alright. Cool. Let me go look at my published work.
[13690.50s -> 13697.81s]  Let's see. National Geographic. Let's take a look inside. Let's find our photos.
[13697.81s -> 13709.01s]  Monthly Nature Power. The African buffalo
[13709.01s -> 13713.19s]  are grazers eating grass and leaves off trees. Those are real photos
[13713.19s -> 13718.77s]  and then mine's a fake one. Imagine you wouldn't get away
[13718.77s -> 13723.08s]  with that. This is a real magazine. Very clearly,
[13723.08s -> 13729.04s]  the one on the left is not real. I'm trying to pull that off.
[13729.04s -> 13736.80s]  It's a computer-generated image. Somebody's not going to pick up on that?
[13736.80s -> 13749.09s]  That's a great picture. I'm shitting on the PlayStation 3 graphics.
[13749.09s -> 13753.09s]  No, I'm saying that the photos on the right are real photos.
[13753.09s -> 13757.09s]  This could be on the PS4. This could be on
[13757.09s -> 13761.27s]  a GTX 2080 of max settings
[13761.27s -> 13765.27s]  on the Frostbite engine, and that's still not a real buffalo over there.
[13765.27s -> 13779.09s]  The real photos look worse. They don't look worse.
[13779.09s -> 13783.09s]  Hang that one on the wall, but I can't take this one down.
[13783.09s -> 13797.62s]  This is me and my friend. I can't do that.
[13797.62s -> 13812.08s]  Let's take a look. We should have news. Here we go. Big ticket item.
[13812.08s -> 13819.78s]  Need a shot of the herd's top trumpet.
[13819.78s -> 13830.48s]  I can't. This is strange for me to say this, but I can't tell.
[13830.48s -> 13835.73s]  Is that video playing here on the right? Claimation.
[13835.73s -> 13839.97s]  It feels like it's stop-motion. The background doesn't look real.
[13839.97s -> 13855.20s]  That's not claimation going on? Wait, no. Look at the end.
[13855.20s -> 13862.93s]  Watch the end. It's over-animated. That's not real.
[13862.93s -> 13866.93s]  All right, take the... Each African elephant herd has a boss who holds it together.
[13866.93s -> 13877.57s]  Could you take a photo of one? That background's not real.
[13877.57s -> 13881.57s]  That's not a real background. That's on a set. That's a set somewhere. Look at the clouds. Look behind them.
[13881.57s -> 13891.17s]  They manufactured that. I'll be right. That's fine.
[13891.17s -> 13905.43s]  It's like a narcissistic thing to say.
[13905.43s -> 13909.43s]  So how do you tell the difference between a boss and the others?
[13909.43s -> 13913.43s]  They battle to determine who gets the position. The winner must have a certain qualities.
[13913.43s -> 13917.92s]  Fierce-looking tusks, for example.
[13917.92s -> 13930.74s]  So big tusks. We've got to find the big boss. I can't do that.
[13930.74s -> 13938.04s]  Okay. Also, this is real. That looks real to me.
[13938.04s -> 13947.33s]  I'm working as a photographer lately trying to steal my business. Just kidding.
[13947.33s -> 13951.33s]  There's a bird called the cattle egret. They travel with large herbivores as a rule.
[13951.33s -> 13955.33s]  I got those requests for a photo for a cattle egret.
[13955.33s -> 13959.33s]  An African elephant together. But I'm too busy. Think you can get the shot for me?
[13959.33s -> 13966.96s]  Take a look at that way that elephant looks.
[13966.96s -> 13972.42s]  And the background and the foreground. Look at the claymation.
[13972.42s -> 13981.57s]  I'm fucking out of here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[13981.57s -> 13985.57s]  If only they'd come a little closer. Let's continue to observe the herd.
[13985.57s -> 13989.57s]  The pond with the anthill will be the perfect place to watch them from.
[13989.57s -> 13998.85s]  I saw them already.
[13998.85s -> 14022.61s]  I have to save the game. I'm sorry. I'm going to spend like five minutes saving this.
[14022.61s -> 14026.61s]  Game sucks. Please play I spy spooky mansion again.
[14026.61s -> 14031.04s]  I like this. I'm not going to do this for that much longer.
[14031.04s -> 14035.04s]  This is the internet test stream. Don't you guys understand?
[14035.04s -> 14054.07s]  There it is. Bingo. I've been playing for five hours?
[14054.07s -> 14060.66s]  I've only been playing for like four? Three and a half?
[14060.66s -> 14067.01s]  Remember I spent 30 minutes creating my character. That doesn't really count as playing.
[14067.01s -> 14072.98s]  Play space channel five. I want to watch Ulala. I have it.
[14072.98s -> 14076.98s]  But I can't do that.
[14076.98s -> 14080.98s]  Because that would require me to take down the PS3.
[14080.98s -> 14084.98s]  And hook up and plug everything in and get everything set up for the Dreamcast.
[14084.98s -> 14089.41s]  Which the Dreamcast is in the closet right now.
[14089.41s -> 14093.41s]  I've got to make sure the audio works.
[14093.41s -> 14098.74s]  Hold on a second though. I've got to show you this.
[14098.74s -> 14111.24s]  This came in the mail. Something finally came in the mail.
[14111.24s -> 14121.62s]  Something people have been waiting for for a while.
[14121.62s -> 14127.72s]  Me too. I had some issues with the mail.
[14127.72s -> 14131.72s]  Where are they? They finally came in. I'm going to finally prove that I own this.
[14131.72s -> 14135.72s]  Because everybody is so annoyed at me for not proving that I own this.
[14135.72s -> 14140.47s]  That's right. The Seaman webcam. There it is.
[14140.47s -> 14147.20s]  The Seaman microphone. I got it.
[14147.20s -> 14154.26s]  So we can actually play that game. What's wrong with it? I look weird.
[14154.26s -> 14168.28s]  Get that off. Yeah it actually came.
[14168.28s -> 14182.04s]  We demand Pikachu socks. I don't even know if that is.
[14182.04s -> 14186.34s]  I look like I've made it a clay. Do I? Am I claymation?
[14186.34s -> 14215.19s]  I do look like I made it a clay. Am I real?
[14215.19s -> 14222.76s]  I made it a clay today. I don't know why. I got a greasy face.
[14222.76s -> 14232.12s]  That's just a clay drive. Relax. What the fuck was I doing?
[14232.12s -> 14236.68s]  Now I'm going to be so self-conscious. Forever. Forever.
[14236.68s -> 14246.48s]  Look what you've done to me. Look what you've done.
[14246.48s -> 14250.48s]  You're in a room. It's like a dark room.
[14250.48s -> 14255.24s]  And all of a sudden TVs turn on. Two TVs back to back.
[14255.24s -> 14261.40s]  You had one second. Which one of these is clay?
[14261.40s -> 14268.95s]  I'm going to do the same motions as the elephant.
[14268.95s -> 14299.09s]  I'll do it for you. Ready? Which one of those is clay?
[14299.09s -> 14303.52s]  Stand up and do it. I'm not fucking standing up and doing that.
[14303.52s -> 14313.96s]  Not a chance. That's just old. Why are you putting the fucking birthing
[14313.96s -> 14328.95s]  scene from Outlast 2? Why would you put that here? I don't know why that's there.
[14328.95s -> 14332.95s]  What was that shit-eating grin? I made it a fucking clay. I gotta get out of here.
[14332.95s -> 14353.11s]  I'm not on camera ever again. Can I get a haircut? I can't.
[14353.11s -> 14358.05s]  I can't get a haircut. Why would I get a haircut?
[14358.05s -> 14362.05s]  It's a shitload of blood vessels. Each individual hair is a blood vessel.
[14362.05s -> 14405.01s]  I don't want to be caught up in bleed and shit.
[14405.01s -> 14410.53s]  German alternative facts are fucking out of hand.
[14410.53s -> 14420.82s]  Alright, what's the deal here? I need to get an elephant.
[14420.82s -> 14435.86s]  I gotta get the boss of the elephant. Does your hair have nerve endings? No.
[14435.86s -> 14440.55s]  They just bleed and it's weird. When you snip the ends of one hair
[14440.55s -> 14446.20s]  of blood, two or three droplets come out of each strand.
[14446.20s -> 14450.20s]  I hate going to the barber. I hate going to the dentist. I hate going to the doctor.
[14450.20s -> 14470.48s]  Is it really going to stop me? Can I just go to the wetlands please?
[14470.48s -> 14493.54s]  Don't you guys know the golden rule of this stream?
[14493.54s -> 14500.72s]  How are you guys losing the golden rule of this stream? Treat others
[14500.72s -> 14504.72s]  the way that you would like to be 95% of everything I say is
[14504.72s -> 14537.11s]  a lie. Alright, elephant.
[14537.11s -> 14541.11s]  If 90 to 95% of everything you say is bullshit
[14541.11s -> 14545.11s]  and just made up, then what about all the times when you say
[14545.11s -> 14549.11s]  things that are really nice and you're not messing around? So everything you say is
[14549.11s -> 14553.11s]  a lie? Well think of how many dumb fucking things I say.
[14553.11s -> 14557.11s]  I'd probably say a hundred stupid things being broadcasted.
[14557.11s -> 14561.11s]  Five of those things would definitely be legit.
[14561.11s -> 14581.52s]  Where are the elephants? They're all on the edge.
[14581.52s -> 14585.89s]  How am I going to get to snap the elephant boss when I can't even
[14585.89s -> 14592.63s]  go over to see them? They're all down there. I can't go over
[14592.63s -> 14601.89s]  there. How do we know that wasn't a lie? I don't know.
[14601.89s -> 14608.68s]  I heard of African elephants coming this way. I heard it's on the move.
[14608.68s -> 14619.04s]  Alright, they're looking for the one with the big tusks.
[14619.04s -> 14625.19s]  The king of the elephants, right?
[14625.19s -> 14631.20s]  Which one of these is the boss? It says you can tell because they start
[14631.20s -> 14640.55s]  fighting and they have big tusks. One of the little ones is
[14640.55s -> 14646.63s]  probably the boss. Well, this is not a Looney Tunes cartoon.
[14646.63s -> 14664.87s]  So I'm going to say the answer to that is probably no. Is that the leader?
[14664.87s -> 14674.04s]  That's the one that's leading everybody here. That could be the one.
[14674.04s -> 14687.92s]  What about boss baby? No. That's like a meme
[14687.92s -> 14692.61s]  answer. You know, boss baby is currently like a funny
[14692.61s -> 14697.88s]  meme right now, right? That's not a bad shot of all the elephants.
[14697.88s -> 14706.52s]  This one has to be the leader. They're all following the leader. I'm not going to get run
[14706.52s -> 14717.67s]  over, right? Yeah, this has to be the leader. Why would they all be following this
[14717.67s -> 14733.86s]  one elephant here? Unless I'm missing something. This one has like a broken
[14733.86s -> 14741.09s]  tusk. This one's been in a bunch of fights. I'm going to say it's probably this one.
[14741.09s -> 14745.09s]  The one in the back? The one in the back has huge tusks. Wait, wait, wait.
[14745.09s -> 14750.16s]  It actually might be the one all the way in back. See how big the tusks are on that one?
[14750.16s -> 14758.50s]  See look, ready? This one has a kind of broken tusk. That one has gigantic
[14758.50s -> 14762.93s]  teeth. Much bigger than anybody else. It's definitely that one back there.
[14762.93s -> 14793.00s]  I've got to get closer. Am I going to be safe here? It's a bad photo.
[14793.00s -> 14809.83s]  It's not you. I need the other one. Oh, fuck. I can't move. I can't move.
[14809.83s -> 14814.45s]  I can't move. Don't move. Don't move. Oh, god. Don't move. Oh, fuck.
[14814.45s -> 14821.57s]  Okay. Got to run. Where's the jeep? It's all the way back there. Oh, fuck.
[14821.57s -> 14827.97s]  Oh, no. I'm going to die. I'm good. Alright, where's the leader? I'm going to wrap
[14827.97s -> 14838.47s]  around here. There's the leader right there. God, perfect opportunity to get
[14838.47s -> 14851.99s]  in front. Right here. Oh, come here you majestic bastard.
[14851.99s -> 14856.84s]  Got it. I can get a better one than that though. It's going to look right in the camera.
[14856.84s -> 14865.22s]  Just get it. That's good. That's good. That looks good. Perfect.
[14865.22s -> 14880.26s]  T-pose to assert dominance. No, don't look at me.
[14880.26s -> 14887.00s]  Las Vegas photographer dies attempting to get pictures of elephant boss baby.
[14887.00s -> 14900.37s]  Okay.
[14900.37s -> 14904.55s]  I need the elephant birds too. Yeah, but where are they? They're not going anywhere.
[14904.55s -> 14911.09s]  I need to get back in the car because look at how far away this is.
[14911.09s -> 14916.16s]  How much longer am I going to be playing? I don't know. Maybe like another hour or so.
[14916.16s -> 14922.13s]  Hour or two. I don't know. I'm still enjoying my time. We're just kind of
[14922.13s -> 14926.13s]  hanging out talking about 95% of everything I say is lies on one of those screens.
[14926.13s -> 14939.96s]  Eric literally does not do anything. No, Eric does not do
[14939.96s -> 14943.96s]  anything. You're right. But here they go. They're going to like the swamp thing here.
[14943.96s -> 14948.71s]  Birds. What? It wants a symbiotic relationship thing.
[14948.71s -> 14955.70s]  What does it want me to do? African elephant's avian sidekick
[14955.70s -> 14959.94s]  shows cattle egret, shows African elephant.
[14959.94s -> 14965.06s]  So they have to just hang out together. Are these egrets?
[14965.06s -> 14970.96s]  Are those egrets? That's an egret right here, right?
[14970.96s -> 14984.13s]  Is it? Get in the tree. Right?
[14984.13s -> 14988.13s]  Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, car, car, car. Get in the tree. I'll get it.
[14988.13s -> 14997.03s]  I'm going to get in the tree. I'm going to cross. There's going to be a bunch of egrets.
[14997.03s -> 15027.24s]  Get fucking up there. Why can't I go up to this?
[15027.24s -> 15036.71s]  Eric is not dumb. Eric's pretty dumb. Alright, the question is I need
[15036.71s -> 15068.71s]  them to walk by. I need an egret. There's no egrets.
[15068.71s -> 15090.98s]  Didn't say that they hang out together here. Where are they going? Oh, this is bullshit.
[15090.98s -> 15100.13s]  Should I pull back? Does that count? Is that an egret right there?
[15100.13s -> 15104.13s]  It might be. Alright, there's like a weird bug in the background.
[15104.13s -> 15114.71s]  There's a smudge on the camera lens, but I think it was an egret. Is that an egret?
[15114.71s -> 15134.72s]  Does that count? I don't know if that counts.
[15134.72s -> 15147.65s]  Alright, well, hopefully that was one of them. Let's see where else they go.
[15147.65s -> 15151.65s]  Six FPS. Claymation Elephants. No, I got it. I got what I needed.
[15151.65s -> 15162.23s]  Yeah, let's get the hell out of here. You guys remember when he tried to play
[15162.23s -> 15184.24s]  Mountain Blade? I do. That was the Herd's leader, yeah. I got him.
[15184.24s -> 15190.82s]  It is this one, but which one's better?
[15190.82s -> 15197.48s]  Probably that one. This one's a little more clear, but this one
[15197.48s -> 15208.93s]  is a better action shot. I'm going to go with this one.
[15208.93s -> 15217.30s]  What do we get? That's alright. I got a B.
[15217.30s -> 15226.96s]  Then the... I don't know if I even have
[15226.96s -> 15230.96s]  because this is correct. This is such a half-ass. This is so half-ass.
[15230.96s -> 15236.10s]  This is the equivalent of you figuring out that you had homework
[15236.10s -> 15240.10s]  in homeroom, and you filled in random answers
[15240.10s -> 15255.46s]  on your math sheet. At least you did it. It's going to have to be
[15255.46s -> 15262.52s]  this first one. Is that even the right bird? I don't even know if that's the right one.
[15262.52s -> 15279.12s]  Whatever. At least I turned it in.
[15279.12s -> 15288.15s]  I turned in the homework. I still need this one. I need new stuff to unlock.
[15288.15s -> 15301.12s]  I got the tent. Give me a new camera.
[15301.12s -> 15305.75s]  You have a 150-word essay due tomorrow. 150-word essay?
[15305.75s -> 15325.83s]  Isn't that... That's like two paragraphs.
[15325.83s -> 15329.83s]  Isn't that a tweet? 150...
[15329.83s -> 15338.87s]  140 characters. Oh, that's an easy essay
[15338.87s -> 15347.46s]  meme in 2019. Oh. Every copypasta
[15347.46s -> 15352.58s]  always works. I don't pay attention
[15352.58s -> 15357.52s]  to this shit. I'm not going to like fucking Copypasta
[15357.52s -> 15361.52s]  Wiki and looking up what's the latest copypasta that came out like two months ago.
[15361.52s -> 15369.46s]  I barely go see movies that come out. Here we go.
[15369.46s -> 15374.21s]  Hello Francine. How you doing? I've been writing a picture book about an elephant mother and child.
[15374.21s -> 15378.21s]  You're on an expedition or something in Africa, right? Perfect timing. Do me a favor.
[15378.21s -> 15382.21s]  Snap me a photo of a baby African elephant. Give me a really cute
[15382.21s -> 15386.21s]  little tyke, one whose tusks haven't grown in yet.
[15386.21s -> 15392.69s]  This is difficult apparently. Do I have to get it falling down?
[15392.69s -> 15396.69s]  This is apparently very difficult. Baby African elephant.
[15396.69s -> 15407.17s]  Little tusks. No tusks. Okay.
[15407.17s -> 15415.43s]  A little tyke. Let's go. I'm going to get fucking killed
[15415.43s -> 15421.00s]  if I go near an elephant's child.
[15421.00s -> 15426.18s]  Well, we'll do just fine.
[15426.18s -> 15431.96s]  Still need to do that one. Alright. Let's get it. We need to photograph an elephant calf.
[15431.96s -> 15435.96s]  You saw an elephant herd in the corongo flats. If you climb
[15435.96s -> 15439.96s]  a tree they won't see you and you can catch them their most natural behavior.
[15439.96s -> 15448.79s]  Go get it. 200 word essay. What's the
[15448.79s -> 15452.79s]  standard for a college essay? Thousand words?
[15452.79s -> 15463.94s]  Two thousand words? I remember like somewhere around a thousand was pretty
[15463.94s -> 15475.72s]  standard. Ten pages. A hundred and fifty. A hundred and fifty words is
[15475.72s -> 15482.12s]  like a chicken cutlet recipe.
[15482.12s -> 15491.97s]  Alright. Baby elephant time. Let's go. I hate this thing.
[15491.97s -> 15498.39s]  A hundred and fifty words is a paragraph, but that's what I mean. Chicken cutlet?
[15498.39s -> 15503.64s]  You want a fucking chicken cutlet? Yeah, we make the best fucking chicken cutlet chip.
[15503.64s -> 15510.95s]  I love. Chicken cutlet is one of my favorite things in the world.
[15510.95s -> 15530.58s]  I'm doing a funny voice. Funny voice.
[15530.58s -> 15534.58s]  I'm not allowed to like change the pitch of my voice to just make like a point about a chicken cutlet.
[15534.58s -> 15553.14s]  He did the funny. If I was to go on Shark Tank,
[15553.14s -> 15567.75s]  who do you guys think would be the shark that would give me the deal?
[15567.75s -> 15573.32s]  None of them. Mark Cuban? Maybe it would be Mr. Wonderful.
[15573.32s -> 15579.28s]  There's a reason why I'm Mr. Wonderful. Fuck his deals. They're always terrible.
[15579.28s -> 15595.41s]  That guy, every time that guy just gives student loans.
[15595.41s -> 15616.20s]  I'm going to work with Laurie. Here we go. We're going to get a baby, right?
[15616.20s -> 15620.20s]  It's a boomer show? That is not a boomer show. That is like a
[15620.20s -> 15624.20s]  general audience. Leave it on the background and who gives a shit show?
[15624.20s -> 15633.30s]  Your baby, without tusks. This baby has tusks.
[15633.30s -> 15641.68s]  Boomer show. God. No, you know what a
[15641.68s -> 15645.68s]  boomer show is? This is how you guys are so wrong.
[15645.68s -> 15651.01s]  It's so wrong for you to say that. The Wheel of Fortune
[15651.01s -> 15658.20s]  is a boomer show. Jeopardy is a boomer show. All the game shows.
[15658.20s -> 15669.97s]  What do you mean no, it's not? Guys, I don't think there's ever been a
[15669.97s -> 15673.97s]  contestant on Wheel of Fortune that was under the age of 45.
[15673.97s -> 15690.42s]  I need another baby. Family Feud is not a boomer show. I didn't say
[15690.42s -> 15694.42s]  Family Feud. Oh, by the way, I bought Family Feud for Playstation 2.
[15694.42s -> 15701.92s]  I don't know why. I just, I had to get it. No, we have another version of Family Feud to play.
[15701.92s -> 15707.06s]  I don't know who the host is on this one. Oh, fuck, that's
[15707.06s -> 15715.08s]  a chase. Is it going to be a T-Rex chase?
[15715.08s -> 15722.64s]  Uh oh, I'm aggroing all of the elephants right now.
[15722.64s -> 15732.07s]  So that's obviously, there's no baby there that has small tusks.
[15732.07s -> 15753.32s]  Dumb request, that is. The other one who took it. But that was my only
[15753.32s -> 15757.32s]  look, I just take the missions. I take the emails. And I determine
[15757.32s -> 15762.39s]  alright, I can do that. I can take a picture of a baby elephant. But has to have no
[15762.39s -> 15772.45s]  tusks. Oh, hey, chat, hazy, did he do the run over the animals
[15772.45s -> 15778.10s]  joke? No, I have not. How long have I been playing for?
[15778.10s -> 15782.10s]  Like four and a half hours and I haven't tried that?
[15782.10s -> 15786.10s]  Oh, yellow owl! Here it comes!
[15786.10s -> 15791.16s]  Oh, what the, oh fuck. What? No, get back in.
[15791.16s -> 15805.68s]  Of course I tried that. That was the first thing I did.
[15805.68s -> 15809.92s]  Repeat what you just said. I'll try. He's like, uh oh.
[15809.92s -> 15818.76s]  Yellow owl! Something like that, right?
[15818.76s -> 15842.24s]  Are those the only elephants that are going to spawn? I don't know why
[15842.24s -> 15846.24s]  I'm just thinking about this. I don't know why I thought this was funny.
[15846.24s -> 15854.64s]  It's like, bad. For some reason I was hoping a low branch was
[15854.64s -> 15858.64s]  going to hang and hit this guy in the face. It's not that funny.
[15858.64s -> 15865.96s]  No, you know, it might have been. It might have been.
[15865.96s -> 15877.92s]  Alright, get out of the fucking car!
[15877.92s -> 15894.93s]  Baby. 12 o'clock. This baby doesn't...
[15894.93s -> 15899.24s]  You're going to have to deal with the picture I give you because if there's no spawned
[15899.24s -> 15903.24s]  elephants that are babies with no tusks then I'm not going to be able to get a picture of it.
[15903.24s -> 15909.97s]  I literally cannot stand the presence of Eric.
[15909.97s -> 15913.97s]  And all First Person does is make him more prevalent in the shot.
[15913.97s -> 15918.66s]  Hold on, there's a lot of babies here. Looks like he's driving the car.
[15918.66s -> 15924.12s]  We've stadium seating for some reason. Why? Pull up to the drive-through.
[15924.12s -> 15928.12s]  Not the drive-through, the drive-in. Yeah, when you pull up to the drive-through he's got a better angle to speak.
[15928.12s -> 15938.55s]  Right there. Baby with big tusks.
[15938.55s -> 15954.88s]  The one right there has big tusks too. You're just going to get a picture of a baby elephant
[15954.88s -> 15958.88s]  and that's pretty much what you're going to get. Sorry.
[15958.88s -> 15962.88s]  They asked for no tusks? I know, but there are no tusks. They all have tusks.
[15962.88s -> 15972.16s]  Just fucking Photoshop them out. Is it really going to be that
[15972.16s -> 15976.16s]  hard for you just to take the paint tool and grab on
[15976.16s -> 15980.16s]  a like color, the eyedropper thing,
[15980.16s -> 15996.61s]  and trace over the tusks? I don't give a shit.
[15996.61s -> 16012.55s]  That's perfect. I'm out. Just make a clay elephant and photograph
[16012.55s -> 16016.55s]  that. What was the side mission? Do we have one?
[16016.55s -> 16020.92s]  This weird one showed a male impala and two
[16020.92s -> 16029.12s]  or more females. Let's get it.
[16029.12s -> 16035.99s]  This game is stupid. No it's not. This game is not stupid.
[16035.99s -> 16047.06s]  That's pretty stupid. But as a whole the game is not stupid.
[16047.06s -> 16053.33s]  What does this game have for a rating?
[16053.33s -> 16057.33s]  The title of the game is Africa with a K.
[16057.33s -> 16062.13s]  Look it up for me. What does it have on
[16062.13s -> 16077.83s]  internet game news? Whatever, IGN.
[16077.83s -> 16083.41s]  Three and a half out of ten on IGN.
[16083.41s -> 16087.41s]  I need three females. There's a male right there.
[16087.41s -> 16097.28s]  One, two. No, I see one this way though.
[16097.28s -> 16103.83s]  It said on the thing only desperate streamers would play this.
[16103.83s -> 16108.07s]  That would be kind of funny if I had an opportunity to take a picture when it was
[16108.07s -> 16114.68s]  sprinting by and I didn't get it.
[16114.68s -> 16125.32s]  I see a bunch of females. Now what I was going to tell you is
[16125.32s -> 16135.41s]  fuck, I'm going to have to wait over here.
[16135.41s -> 16139.41s]  This is not desperate boomer. Why did I even add boomer?
[16139.41s -> 16143.72s]  I didn't even need to do that. Desperate streamer? No, no, no.
[16143.72s -> 16147.72s]  Does it say anywhere there about testing your internet? This is a test the internet game.
[16147.72s -> 16151.72s]  If your internet works, then you can play it and stream it for a little while.
[16151.72s -> 16155.72s]  Just to make sure the internet works so when you do the real stream tomorrow
[16155.72s -> 16159.96s]  that you'll know the internet's going to stay on. Does it say that anywhere?
[16159.96s -> 16168.92s]  Alright, what do we got? There's a male right there.
[16168.92s -> 16176.53s]  I think this game's fun. Okay, got it. Right here. Come on.
[16176.53s -> 16192.45s]  That male's right there. And at least three females.
[16192.45s -> 16199.19s]  This is like Pokemon Snap without the fun of Pokemon. Oh, I gotta get that a shot of the male.
[16199.19s -> 16215.70s]  That's not good. That's not good.
[16215.70s -> 16222.56s]  I gotta get closer. This is the right shot though. Keep him right in the middle.
[16222.56s -> 16236.32s]  Right there. Come on, get it. Are they wagging their tails? Head up.
[16236.32s -> 16249.00s]  I got it. I got it. You've walked forward to zoom back out. Yeah, because of
[16249.00s -> 16264.61s]  depth. Wait, we have another opportunity here for elephant.
[16264.61s -> 16273.64s]  Baby elephant right here? Maybe not, that's not a baby elephant.
[16273.64s -> 16297.27s]  It's the same one I already took a picture of before. They don't seem to really want to protect this baby.
[16297.27s -> 16304.26s]  I can get a great shot. The baby's not even going to move.
[16304.26s -> 16320.18s]  Alright, fine. No. Come here. That was close. I can get it again.
[16320.18s -> 16337.57s]  Right when it crosses the plane. This thing can probably kill me.
[16337.57s -> 16342.96s]  No, I can just leapfrog it. I have a thousand percent confidence that I could leapfrog
[16342.96s -> 16347.59s]  that elephant if it charged at me. Just jump as high as you can. Push down
[16347.59s -> 16358.48s]  four arms hard as you can up over the elephant. Alright, I got the fucking photo.
[16358.48s -> 16372.18s]  Let's go. I don't think anyone can do that. I don't think they could.
[16372.18s -> 16378.32s]  The jackass guys used to do that all the time.
[16378.32s -> 16384.92s]  They would like jump over shit. Alright.
[16384.92s -> 16397.97s]  I'm pretty sure Stevo has done what I just said in a jackass episode.
[16397.97s -> 16406.36s]  Let's get a good one. Baby elephant. I mean, that's cute.
[16406.36s -> 16410.36s]  I don't know if it's a good perfect frame, but it's pretty good.
[16410.36s -> 16423.54s]  I said get a cute one.
[16423.54s -> 16431.22s]  It's life.
[16431.22s -> 16438.21s]  Oh, get a cute one. That's so bad.
[16438.21s -> 16442.21s]  That's so bad. Oh yeah, go up in a tree.
[16442.21s -> 16455.99s]  Did you see this one yet? I mean, come on.
[16455.99s -> 16460.48s]  He even got the smoke on his legs. Just disturbing.
[16460.48s -> 16464.48s]  Disturbing nature. Not even remotely close to what they asked for.
[16464.48s -> 16468.92s]  Alright. That's good.
[16468.92s -> 16478.45s]  Alright, there you go in the picture book.
[16478.45s -> 16501.51s]  That's not an elephant calf. Okay, so that was not a...
[16501.51s -> 16505.51s]  That is absolutely an elephant calf. Absolutely.
[16505.51s -> 16524.44s]  There's no way that's not a baby. What? That doesn't make any sense.
[16524.44s -> 16532.29s]  Which is the good one here. Probably this one.
[16532.29s -> 16543.94s]  Sorry, I'll take the money. No tusks to send in the email.
[16543.94s -> 16551.75s]  I thought that was a criteria for...
[16551.75s -> 16559.38s]  That's fucking running away. That is so bad.
[16559.38s -> 16576.80s]  We already did this one. We already did that one. Keep that.
[16576.80s -> 16582.48s]  No, no, no. Keep this one. Keep that one. Keep that one.
[16582.48s -> 16586.48s]  Keep this one. Keep the terriers. Yep, two terriers.
[16586.48s -> 16594.88s]  Keep that one. Okay, delete. Okay, let's go to camera.
[16594.88s -> 16602.52s]  Anything new with the camera? Same lens.
[16602.52s -> 16607.33s]  I don't have any lenses or anything. I can't really buy one.
[16607.33s -> 16611.33s]  I gotta get this calf apparently somehow. I don't know what I'm missing here.
[16611.33s -> 16617.62s]  I'm getting the photo storage.
[16617.62s -> 16621.92s]  Because we need to buy it all so the game knows that I bought everything.
[16621.92s -> 16632.63s]  Play Apex.
[16632.63s -> 16641.08s]  I don't play those kind of games. Any new emails? No.
[16641.08s -> 16648.20s]  I need to still get this stupid thing.
[16648.20s -> 16652.20s]  Let me look at this camera.
[16652.20s -> 16656.20s]  I've never snapped a photo of a baby African elephant. Give me a really cute one.
[16656.20s -> 16660.20s]  One whose tusks haven't grown in yet. That's why this one's at four cameras
[16660.20s -> 16664.20s]  out of five. And it's 40 grand.
[16664.20s -> 16674.00s]  You gotta get the right spawn. Alright, I'm gonna pee my pants.
[16674.00s -> 16678.00s]  I'll be right back in like 30 minutes. I'm just kidding. Don't leave.
[16678.00s -> 16907.59s]  You can if you want to. But I'll be back in like two minutes. Gotta pee.
[16907.59s -> 16911.59s]  Holy shit, they made candied bacon downstairs. I gotta get out of here.
[16911.59s -> 16916.84s]  That was delicious.
[16916.84s -> 16923.49s]  Brown sugar, maple, bacon. It's unbelievable.
[16923.49s -> 16936.55s]  Alright, what were we doing? Baby elephant thing again, right?
[16936.55s -> 16952.29s]  Let's try it again. End of the stream, bacon? Not yet.
[16952.29s -> 16960.80s]  Not yet. We're good. I'm gonna keep going because I don't know what the status
[16960.80s -> 16965.75s]  is gonna be tomorrow. You know what I mean? It's easy to be like, oh, you know what? It's been like five hours.
[16965.75s -> 16972.42s]  Okay. No, I'm serious. No, no, no. This might be the
[16972.42s -> 16977.04s]  green day of the week. I have no idea. So I'm just gonna keep going.
[16977.04s -> 16994.07s]  I'm having fun. Green day of the week? Yeah. I do it every time.
[16994.07s -> 17000.68s]  It's happened every single time. Do you want to just cut them down?
[17000.68s -> 17014.39s]  No, no, no, that's bad. They don't leave nature alone. Alright, we'll just play a vibe game.
[17014.39s -> 17018.39s]  That's next up. That is the next thing that I want to do.
[17018.39s -> 17023.65s]  That's the real... I'm going in.
[17023.65s -> 17034.08s]  A lot of VR shit to do. What's the point of Eric?
[17034.08s -> 17038.08s]  I think what the developers were looking for was somebody to take up
[17038.08s -> 17046.04s]  screen real estate, and that's it. Cause I guess
[17046.04s -> 17050.04s]  in that tent, in that camp, if it's just empty, that doesn't feel
[17050.04s -> 17054.34s]  realistic. He's just like a researcher. They just put him there.
[17054.34s -> 17062.23s]  He just takes up real estate. So what was this? A 3.5 out of
[17062.23s -> 17069.86s]  10? I don't agree with that. I would put this... I would give it at least a 5.
[17069.86s -> 17081.19s]  Alright, baby elephants, let's go. It's a 68 on
[17081.19s -> 17086.71s]  Metacritic. That's probably the exact score I would give it.
[17086.71s -> 17095.48s]  Is it 68? Maybe. I'm willing to put this up to a 7-0
[17095.48s -> 17099.65s]  if, and only if, this is a very, very important detail.
[17099.65s -> 17105.22s]  If the next boss fight is cool.
[17105.22s -> 17109.22s]  The cheetah was interesting, but whatever this area's boss, in quotes,
[17109.22s -> 17113.52s]  is, if it's cool and fun, I might knock it up
[17113.52s -> 17128.88s]  to a 7-0. I'm going to search for elephants. What are the downsides?
[17128.88s -> 17132.88s]  Driving into any form of bush or
[17132.88s -> 17137.76s]  grass stops the car. And
[17137.76s -> 17143.73s]  it's a vast, open, sandbox experience. It just feels empty.
[17143.73s -> 17166.77s]  No babies, though. Are you playing
[17166.77s -> 17172.04s]  this game still? Yeah. I actually, this is fun.
[17172.04s -> 17176.04s]  It might not be a good game, but it's fun, and
[17176.04s -> 17180.85s]  it's rare. So, come on, that gives it a few points.
[17180.85s -> 17186.16s]  The fact that it's rare, and
[17186.16s -> 17190.16s]  your good friend Jeremy spent $50
[17190.16s -> 17194.53s]  on this game. So I'm going to get a $50 experience.
[17194.53s -> 17207.27s]  How am I supposed to find this shit? That baby
[17207.27s -> 17220.28s]  has tusks. Use a PlayStation 3
[17220.28s -> 17225.16s]  emulator. Alright, as somebody that's tried to do
[17225.16s -> 17229.16s]  emulators for last generation,
[17229.16s -> 17235.81s]  is not there yet. There are a handful of games that really, truly
[17235.81s -> 17254.07s]  work as intended on, like, a PS3 emulator. Have you seen any
[17254.07s -> 17260.68s]  elephants? And something tells me, and this might just be a hunch
[17260.68s -> 17265.54s]  here, that the Safari
[17265.54s -> 17269.54s]  Photography, the Safari Photograph video game, Africa,
[17269.54s -> 17273.54s]  is not high on the list to get it to work well with an emulator.
[17273.54s -> 17280.02s]  I would probably say that's an accurate statement.
[17280.02s -> 17294.29s]  Where are the elephants? God damn it. Alright, huge pack of elephants.
[17294.29s -> 17301.08s]  Where are the babies? Why do I have to be
[17301.08s -> 17308.18s]  on the rare quest? You have tusks. Yes, I know
[17308.18s -> 17315.80s]  what those are. I know where they are. Leave me alone. You also have
[17315.80s -> 17323.09s]  tusks. Am I supposed to climb a tree for this one? Yeah, but
[17323.09s -> 17327.84s]  am I just going to climb a tree and wait for elephants to walk by the tree?
[17327.84s -> 17344.42s]  How long that's going to take? Get out of the way. Come on.
[17344.42s -> 17358.56s]  Elephants are attracted to people in trees. And plus
[17358.56s -> 17362.74s]  another thing about emulators, that I'm not entirely sure everybody
[17362.74s -> 17369.22s]  is aware of this, they're illegal. Like, as like
[17369.22s -> 17373.22s]  a streamer, as somebody who is broadcasting themselves to the internet,
[17373.22s -> 17378.10s]  hey guys, like, I don't own this shit. I just downloaded it online
[17378.10s -> 17384.96s]  for free. It's kind of just inviting an issue
[17384.96s -> 17392.53s]  potentially. Emulators aren't, but ROMs can be.
[17392.53s -> 17398.10s]  There's a lot of weird, there's a lot of weird slippery
[17398.10s -> 17411.49s]  legislature with like emulating video games.
[17411.49s -> 17415.49s]  So let's say for instance, let's say I got a
[17415.49s -> 17419.49s]  RCS, PS3, whatever it is.
[17419.49s -> 17423.49s]  Let's say I got that emulator and I downloaded this game and I don't own it.
[17423.49s -> 17427.49s]  Let's say I just streamed this game on an emulator without buying or owning the game.
[17427.49s -> 17439.22s]  You're not supposed to do that. But I do own it.
[17439.22s -> 17444.74s]  But why would I, why would I emulate this now? There's no reason for me to
[17444.74s -> 17449.11s]  emulate this game. Do we have a stray baby elephant with no tusks for
[17449.11s -> 17460.88s]  no reason? What? It has tusks. What are you doing out here?
[17460.88s -> 17476.44s]  Now you could also argue, like for instance, if a game
[17476.44s -> 17480.61s]  is actually not even viable, like
[17480.61s -> 17486.58s]  straight up you can't get it anywhere. And alright, maybe it's
[17486.58s -> 17498.95s]  how else are you going to play it, right? Emulation and ROMs are actually
[17498.95s -> 17504.58s]  what they're doing is they're backing up the
[17504.58s -> 17508.58s]  history of video games. As you saw recently with all this shit
[17508.58s -> 17512.58s]  with the Wii Shop channel and you know, games going into
[17512.58s -> 17516.58s]  abandoned ware. Oh, it's like this random Super Nintendo game that you will never
[17516.58s -> 17520.58s]  see, you will never play, you will never find ever again. There are no copies that are in
[17520.58s -> 17524.58s]  circulation anymore. You can argue that there's a reason to
[17524.58s -> 17536.24s]  have backups of video games forever. But
[17536.24s -> 17541.64s]  if I have the means to do it and I've tried doing emulation before
[17541.64s -> 17546.00s]  and it just always had like some random problem that was like, oh
[17546.00s -> 17550.00s]  well that's good, it's the emulator. It's like, well fuck, okay, well why don't I just get the damn thing
[17550.00s -> 17554.00s]  for real and not have to worry about any potential issues that pop up from
[17554.00s -> 17558.00s]  emulating like a last generation game. Is that a baby up there?
[17558.00s -> 17566.15s]  And there's even a list online of PS3 emulated
[17566.15s -> 17572.31s]  games and how much they function. It's like, oh this one
[17572.31s -> 17576.31s]  like kind of works. This one doesn't work. This one doesn't work at all. This one like loads
[17576.31s -> 17581.38s]  past level four. Like you can actually see which ones are even
[17581.38s -> 17585.38s]  being like worked on to help, you know. What are you doing out here?
[17585.38s -> 17599.44s]  That's the one that I chased away. Well, why?
[17599.44s -> 17605.33s]  How am I supposed to do this? If at any given moment
[17605.33s -> 17609.76s]  if one or two troops of elephants spawn
[17609.76s -> 17615.32s]  then all of them have tusks.
[17615.32s -> 17636.87s]  How much do you find, monster?
[17636.87s -> 17648.40s]  What are your thoughts on games being forcibly removed due to licensing issues like
[17648.40s -> 17653.67s]  the Scott Pilgrim game on PS3? I don't know, I'm kind of
[17653.67s -> 17657.67s]  of the opinion that if you fucking made something and you've released it and people bought it and
[17657.67s -> 17661.67s]  you sold it, are you really going to be upset that people want
[17661.67s -> 17666.61s]  to buy it and still play it and resell it?
[17666.61s -> 17682.61s]  It's like, you already did it. Here comes another troop. Yeah, just stay in the car, Eric.
[17682.61s -> 17687.24s]  Everything will be fine. Tusks. Put this down.
[17687.24s -> 17693.33s]  Binoculars and more. Can I please get a baby with no tusks? You have
[17693.33s -> 17703.52s]  tusks. Did I actually hit the wall in this game? I may have.
[17703.52s -> 17721.00s]  Is this the soft lock mission? Find two elephants having
[17721.00s -> 17732.98s]  sex and then follow them for nine months. This is the boss battle? No.
[17732.98s -> 17739.33s]  It wouldn't have like a cool cut scene. Nine months?
[17739.33s -> 17749.40s]  Wait, hold on. A baby, an elephant is pregnant for
[17749.40s -> 17755.60s]  32 months? Look at that. Oh my
[17755.60s -> 17764.88s]  god. Almost two years of pregnancy.
[17764.88s -> 17776.36s]  Humans come out too early. Yeah, they are massive when they come out. Yeah, that's
[17776.36s -> 17785.84s]  true. Alright, can I like cheat this game and put cheat codes
[17785.84s -> 17791.80s]  in and just skip this one? Maybe I have to
[17791.80s -> 17797.51s]  get in a tree. Maybe that's part of it. Maybe I have to trigger the
[17797.51s -> 17810.90s]  cut scene. Let me look at this one more time. Does this have any info on it for me?
[17810.90s -> 17818.02s]  Client, Irino, African, elephant,
[17818.02s -> 17833.19s]  calf. Cheated enough for
[17833.19s -> 17848.55s]  one scream? What do you mean? Cheated? I'm gonna get in
[17848.55s -> 17852.55s]  this and see if I trigger a cut scene or something because it did say that I could get up.
[17852.55s -> 17866.44s]  Snap a baby elephant. Give me a cut scene.
[17866.44s -> 17875.48s]  Oh god damn it is a fucking cut scene. I can't believe it. I've been
[17875.48s -> 17881.83s]  driving around in circles for like 30, 40 minutes. Look, there's a
[17881.83s -> 17885.83s]  calf or the elephant herd. I took the wrong photos. Oh, there it is. There's the
[17885.83s -> 17896.08s]  one with no tusks. Descripted. Descripted event.
[17896.08s -> 17902.76s]  Good. This is the boss. Snap parent and child African elephant.
[17902.76s -> 17925.40s]  Which one is the parent? Not bad.
[17925.40s -> 17930.72s]  I don't like this one. I don't like this. I don't like this. Change it. Change it. Change it. Change it. Change it.
[17930.72s -> 17978.34s]  Manual. Fuck! Get out of the shot. Out of the shot. Go!
[17978.34s -> 18045.97s]  Bye. Let's see what my best photo was. You don't just kind of want one.
[18045.97s -> 18056.28s]  Elephants? Could you have an elephant as a pet?
[18056.28s -> 18065.81s]  If you had a huge backyard and you put up like T-Rex fences
[18065.81s -> 18069.81s]  I'm talking you own like 40 acres. Like 50 acres of land.
[18069.81s -> 18074.18s]  100 acres of land. And you have man-made pools and
[18074.18s -> 18084.12s]  man-made shrubbery and bushes and shit.
[18084.12s -> 18089.32s]  Which one is the good one? The black and... No it's not!
[18089.32s -> 18093.32s]  The last black and white photo I took was way better than all these.
[18093.32s -> 18105.17s]  Really cared for the young. Well how did it go? Did you get your photos of the baby elephant?
[18105.17s -> 18115.75s]  I did. Yeah you have like 100 acres of land. You have walls
[18115.75s -> 18125.28s]  surrounding the whole thing. And you have one giant elephant.
[18125.28s -> 18129.28s]  Yeah and like some of you guys said you could have another part of land. Let's say you own 100 acres.
[18129.28s -> 18133.28s]  Like 10 acres could be for elephants. Like 5, 10 acres could be
[18133.28s -> 18137.28s]  for bears. Get a couple of bears. Make sure they're all fenced off completely.
[18137.28s -> 18142.23s]  Maybe have like a penguin exhibit too. Like get ice
[18142.23s -> 18156.77s]  shipped in. Like 50 acres or something. Who's gonna clean it?
[18156.77s -> 18161.01s]  You can hire a staff. You know if you have that kind of money to have an elephant
[18161.01s -> 18165.01s]  for a pet you probably have money to spend. So you hire like
[18165.01s -> 18170.85s]  100 people. 100 staff to take care of the animals.
[18170.85s -> 18174.85s]  And then maybe have like a little area
[18174.85s -> 18178.85s]  that's small. Like a building that you develop that has like stuffed animals
[18178.85s -> 18183.80s]  in it. Of the animals that are there. And coloring books and shit.
[18183.80s -> 18187.97s]  And then you could like invite people over to come and hang out.
[18187.97s -> 18206.10s]  I love how much people hate this.
[18206.10s -> 18216.55s]  And yeah yeah you could charge. Just you know to cover the costs
[18216.55s -> 18220.55s]  of you know you have like pet elephants and pet bears and shit. Like $20 to come and look
[18220.55s -> 18230.87s]  around. Alright I don't know how this one
[18230.87s -> 18241.17s]  the composition of this one is not. This one is way better.
[18241.17s -> 18245.17s]  Look at the depth of field on this one. This one's like 5 times better.
[18245.17s -> 18265.84s]  This is really the best algorithm. It's
[18265.84s -> 18270.15s]  because of the mother pushing up. I guess.
[18270.15s -> 18283.97s]  Well that's apparently the best one so I'm gonna listen to the game.
[18283.97s -> 18289.60s]  Accidental black and white photo? Accidental?
[18289.60s -> 18296.64s]  Now I turned it on. I did that intentionally. That's a lot of money.
[18296.64s -> 18304.15s]  How could the angle not be better than that? Considering they told
[18304.15s -> 18309.41s]  me to go in this tree. This was a cut scene. I got cut
[18309.41s -> 18313.41s]  into this angle and it was a bad angle. That's not my fault.
[18313.41s -> 18325.72s]  Another job done and we're still on one piece. Tomorrow we start early. Let's get some rest.
[18325.72s -> 18338.45s]  He was supposed to be on top of the elephant. Good morning Francine.
[18338.45s -> 18348.24s]  Be sure to check your email. Sending map new area. Alright
[18348.24s -> 18355.86s]  I think this might be one of the last areas. New camera. Thank you for your continued
[18355.86s -> 18359.86s]  business. In today's newsletter we'd like to let our A100 users know
[18359.86s -> 18363.86s]  the product they've been waiting for has finally arrived. A 24 to
[18363.86s -> 18367.86s]  105mm f-stop of 3.5 to 4.5 is an interchangeable
[18367.86s -> 18371.86s]  lens for the A series. Switch lenses and
[18371.86s -> 18375.86s]  power up your photography. Pro shop for more details.
[18375.86s -> 18385.20s]  We got a new area. The Choroa Gorge.
[18385.20s -> 18389.20s]  Harsh lands surrounded by rocks and sand.
[18389.20s -> 18399.19s]  Let's research the area. We're gonna get an ad.
[18399.19s -> 18414.04s]  We're actually getting a fucking ad. Clever.
[18414.04s -> 18418.72s]  Alright well there it is. Wide angle to mid range telephoto.
[18418.72s -> 18427.11s]  Let's do it. Compact. High power standard. Zoom.
[18427.11s -> 18436.53s]  Wide angle. Beautiful. This whole game
[18436.53s -> 18446.64s]  is really just product placement. It's funny because back in the day
[18446.64s -> 18451.25s]  here. 2007, 2008.
[18451.25s -> 18459.97s]  I like how desperate are you Sony. Canon was the leader here.
[18459.97s -> 18463.97s]  Alright so this is the telephoto. We're gonna get some cool photographs with this one.
[18463.97s -> 18472.04s]  Is Canon still the leader? Wouldn't surprise me at all. They make
[18472.04s -> 18489.51s]  high quality fucking cameras. I still haven't used this at all.
[18489.51s -> 18493.68s]  This is a next level sponsored stream. Play a game
[18493.68s -> 18497.68s]  that has a competitor advertising all over the place and have streamer
[18497.68s -> 18501.68s]  talk about how dumb it is and bad it is and then mention Canon once
[18501.68s -> 18505.68s]  and subliminally get that
[18505.68s -> 18510.63s]  message inside of the consumers head. I'm having trouble with words tonight.
[18510.63s -> 18521.25s]  I don't know why. That one's better so I'm gonna get rid of these.
[18521.25s -> 18529.78s]  Nope. Keep these. I have to have a bunch of memories from each encounter.
[18529.78s -> 18539.00s]  Alright let's go explore the new area. All DSLRs
[18539.00s -> 18544.84s]  are the same. Canon is definitely still
[18544.84s -> 18555.96s]  the best. What do they got now? Didn't Kodak literally
[18555.96s -> 18568.24s]  go bankrupt? Did they? Canon's not worth the money.
[18568.24s -> 18586.21s]  It's Nikon now. Nikon's the best now?
[18586.21s -> 18590.96s]  Nikon's doing well.
[18590.96s -> 18597.83s]  Nikon's doing alright in the
[18597.83s -> 18603.65s]  consumer level. You buy a Nikon
[18603.65s -> 18607.96s]  T2100 whatever series
[18607.96s -> 18612.84s]  and you bring it on vacation and take nice pictures. You bring
[18612.84s -> 18616.84s]  that to Vegas and you take a picture of Excalibur at the hotel and you're like oh that was
[18616.84s -> 18620.84s]  worth like in the consumer $280
[18620.84s -> 18641.33s]  kind of nice consumer level.
[18641.33s -> 18645.33s]  I find Sony to be the best for photography.
[18645.33s -> 18649.33s]  Photography? Holy shit Jeremy.
[18649.33s -> 18653.33s]  Get your fucking head screwed on. Photographing.
[18653.33s -> 18658.72s]  What's wrong with me tonight? I tell you the high winds I must have
[18658.72s -> 18666.10s]  blown my brain around in my skull. It was crazy though.
[18666.10s -> 18670.10s]  Let me tell you. Vitalix and I were outside just
[18670.10s -> 18674.10s]  curing shit because the wind can cause damage. We're making sure
[18674.10s -> 18678.10s]  we don't lose stuff that can fly around and around the house.
[18678.10s -> 18682.10s]  Outside the house and all that shit. This was like a movie. This was like being on set
[18682.10s -> 18686.10s]  in a fucking tornado themed movie. It was terrifying.
[18686.10s -> 18693.28s]  It was at the point where you had to lean into the wind or you were going to fall
[18693.28s -> 18698.55s]  over. Plant your feet and stuff your back into the huge 60
[18698.55s -> 18714.29s]  fucking mile per hour gust or you're going down. It was crazy.
[18714.29s -> 18720.39s]  Close your mouth or your dentures will fly out.
[18720.39s -> 18725.78s]  Open your mouth for a second and you can see it just skyrocket over the horizon.
[18725.78s -> 18732.32s]  New zone? This is not the new zone. Why do you have to drive so slow through the new
[18732.32s -> 18740.77s]  areas? Las Vegas doesn't ever get that type of weather does it?
[18740.77s -> 18745.46s]  From my understanding, not the rain.
[18745.46s -> 18750.92s]  The rain is something that doesn't happen very often. So we got to shitload of rain.
[18750.92s -> 18754.92s]  I think they actually broke a record yesterday.
[18754.92s -> 18758.92s]  The most rain ever in one day, at least on Valentine's Day,
[18758.92s -> 18763.28s]  broke a record somehow. But the wind from my understanding
[18763.28s -> 18767.28s]  is it happens a lot. Vegas is a very windy
[18767.28s -> 18773.36s]  city. But being here for about four and a half
[18773.36s -> 18778.76s]  months, we've never experienced that. More than like
[18778.76s -> 18785.17s]  60 plus mile per hour wind gusts. So it does get windy
[18785.17s -> 18789.17s]  around here but it can get pretty extreme sometimes.
[18789.17s -> 18813.57s]  I don't even know where the hell it comes from. I actually kind of like that picture.
[18813.57s -> 18823.99s]  I really like this. Can you run over animal?
[18823.99s -> 18831.56s]  You cannot run over animal. Has the minimum changed yet?
[18831.56s -> 18835.80s]  Not yet. The minimum is changing over the next couple of days though.
[18835.80s -> 18840.55s]  So just to make sure you're aware, the bit minimum is
[18840.55s -> 18848.88s]  increasing to 250. 250 is the new bit reading
[18848.88s -> 18852.88s]  minimum. As of like now.
[18852.88s -> 18857.12s]  But not as of this stream.
[18857.12s -> 18861.12s]  If that makes any sense. So in the next few streams we're going to slowly
[18861.12s -> 18869.46s]  transition it. I did bring it down from three because
[18869.46s -> 18873.46s]  some of the things that people were saying, there were some good points
[18873.46s -> 18878.32s]  about how buying bits makes a three dollar
[18878.32s -> 18882.32s]  minimum sort of awkward because they don't come in threes, they come in
[18882.32s -> 18888.80s]  fives. How do you slowly transition that?
[18888.80s -> 18892.98s]  It's instantly over one day. But over the course of the last
[18892.98s -> 18896.98s]  three weeks or so, almost about a month, I've been slowly telling everybody
[18896.98s -> 18900.98s]  that it's going to happen in mid-February. So I mean
[18900.98s -> 18904.98s]  I have slowly been telling everybody it was going to happen in mid-February and now we're in mid-February.
[18904.98s -> 18910.50s]  It's going to take one day. Are there ostriches here?
[18910.50s -> 18922.47s]  There are ostriches in Africa? I thought these were like
[18922.47s -> 18931.51s]  only in New Zealand. Isn't this like the New Zealand state bird?
[18931.51s -> 18944.04s]  That's a good photo. That's emus.
[18944.04s -> 18961.94s]  Wait. Let's put it on auto for now. No get
[18961.94s -> 18980.84s]  the fucking black and white off. Well let's start surveying from this location.
[18980.84s -> 18988.28s]  Francine, why don't you take the wheel. Well there's an actual
[18988.28s -> 18993.54s]  camera emulator. Yeah. It has all the settings.
[18993.54s -> 18998.34s]  That's why this game is really... Can I just drop this guy off?
[18998.34s -> 19003.86s]  You actually don't have a reason to be here. Let me get out and get a good picture of this. Never mind.
[19003.86s -> 19019.99s]  Let's go. That guy's just back there smoking a blunt. Okay slow
[19019.99s -> 19028.32s]  down. Let me get a good one. This is a good horizon here. Now you're ruining
[19028.32s -> 19044.96s]  the shot. Get out of the way. Nice. Nice. Oh you're getting close.
[19044.96s -> 19059.70s]  Oh work with me here. Work with me here. Look at this one.
[19059.70s -> 19064.13s]  Whoa. I love it. I love it. I hope you just get out of the way.
[19064.13s -> 19068.13s]  I gotta get a little tighter. I don't want that little deer in the way. Come on. Come on.
[19068.13s -> 19088.24s]  Come on. This is like a fucking car commercial. Do it. Do it. Do it. He's using the
[19088.24s -> 19109.49s]  rule of search. I like that one. There's nothing wrong with
[19109.49s -> 19124.85s]  this photo. Why is that such a bad thing? That one's really good too.
[19124.85s -> 19133.32s]  That one actually might be the best one. Why not a different shutter?
[19133.32s -> 19147.72s]  Well because I want my photos to look awful. I can make one of these
[19147.72s -> 19156.23s]  my desktop background. Oh that's some pretty good photos. I like the
[19156.23s -> 19164.93s]  landscape here. Kubwa rock. Put your ISO at
[19164.93s -> 19174.74s]  12,000. Any more wildlife? Probably rhinos here.
[19174.74s -> 19182.82s]  I need to get a good picture of Oscar. All right we got something else over here.
[19182.82s -> 19189.17s]  What's this? Where are the lions? This has got to be the lion
[19189.17s -> 19210.36s]  zone. It has to be. New bird. One of those will be good enough.
[19210.36s -> 19229.96s]  Let's do a real slow, slow fucking shutter.
[19229.96s -> 19260.23s]  Stop moving. It's too bright. No. Get out of the menu.
[19260.23s -> 19275.46s]  Okay. Manual. Other
[19275.46s -> 19298.26s]  direction. You gotta go up. You gotta close the iris. Not open it.
[19298.26s -> 19338.71s]  Stay right there. Right there. Right there. Stay. Stay. Stay. Stay. Right there. Right there. There it is.
[19338.71s -> 19353.03s]  Stay there. Right there. Look at that. No I moved.
[19353.03s -> 19359.38s]  No. No. No. No. No. It's just shutter. The shutter. That was perfect. The shutter
[19359.38s -> 19363.75s]  has got to be quicker than that. Oh he walked by at the right time. Don't move.
[19363.75s -> 19376.55s]  Walk into frame. Come on. Walk into frame so I can get the good
[19376.55s -> 19393.00s]  depth of field here. I'll follow you as long as I need to.
[19393.00s -> 19399.33s]  I'll get it. It's going to be a good one. Watch this. Oh if I was only a
[19399.33s -> 19405.88s]  little bit. Come on. I need you like down here.
[19405.88s -> 19420.26s]  I gotta move. Opportunity is knocking right now. You dumb
[19420.26s -> 19457.64s]  dickhead. That was what I wanted. This one's not bad. I don't mind
[19457.64s -> 19465.33s]  this one. Yeah this is the. We finally got the. I got the right exposure here.
[19465.33s -> 19476.53s]  Whoops. Can you imagine. If it was a little turn the other
[19476.53s -> 19481.59s]  way. Can you imagine how good this one would have been. It's still alright.
[19481.59s -> 19486.08s]  If I could have gone. I need a bigger lens. I want to go closer. Go right
[19486.08s -> 19510.72s]  up in his face. But I can't do that. I need a better shutter.
[19510.72s -> 19543.12s]  No. Every one of you fucking dumb inputs are wrong.
[19543.12s -> 19558.29s]  I need to get a better lens. Can I just buy one.
[19558.29s -> 19562.29s]  No live preview when adjusting the settings. Yeah that's the one unfortunate thing. You only
[19562.29s -> 19566.29s]  get the pre. It shows you what you got. Actually hold on.
[19566.29s -> 19575.64s]  All of you stay right there. If I can get in front.
[19575.64s -> 19617.73s]  Wait wait wait. Shhh. No no no. God.
[19617.73s -> 19627.65s]  Come this way. Come on. I need a tree right here.
[19627.65s -> 19682.29s]  Fuck. It's alright. Close enough. That's what I want.
[19682.29s -> 19691.33s]  I want it to be a little darker. I don't want it blown out. I need one of them to
[19691.33s -> 19700.29s]  go through that tree. I need to get up here. Master plan. Come on.
[19700.29s -> 19705.41s]  What I want. I want. I want one of you to go through here.
[19705.41s -> 19710.42s]  Like that. And I get you right in the middle. I'm going to go a little closer.
[19710.42s -> 19728.02s]  Oh fuck it. Whatever. I'm taking this too seriously. This is fun.
[19728.02s -> 19736.74s]  Press R3. It drops bait for the animal.
[19736.74s -> 19740.92s]  Add that to the list of bullshit things I've heard in the last two days.
[19740.92s -> 19764.85s]  Can I have them take the wheel so I can take a photo? Guys don't you know
[19764.85s -> 19769.92s]  that a photographer will take two thousand photos
[19769.92s -> 19773.92s]  at an event or something they're hired for. And only like
[19773.92s -> 19797.22s]  four of them are going to get used. Oh it's fast. I can see that one.
[19797.22s -> 19805.75s]  If only it was a little bit more.
[19805.75s -> 19814.44s]  Oh you're coming right at me. I got a chance. What are you doing?
[19814.44s -> 19819.25s]  Wow. Meerkats. That's the first piece of dialogue you've had in four days, Eric.
[19819.25s -> 19923.76s]  Shut up. I'm putting the camera right in there. I'm trying so hard
[19923.76s -> 19927.76s]  to not make any noise. I'm hopping right now. What are you doing?
[19927.76s -> 19932.45s]  Nobody walks like that. Nice stealth
[19932.45s -> 19939.94s]  walk. Look at how majestic this bird is.
[19939.94s -> 19979.49s]  I got to get closer to this. What are you?
[19979.49s -> 19999.33s]  No, no, no, no. No. Shit you threw it in the photo.
[19999.33s -> 20010.84s]  You dick. That's a pretty good class picture. Okay I'm gone.
[20010.84s -> 20018.39s]  It's really weird. Okay.
[20018.39s -> 20033.56s]  What was I doing? Oh yeah meerkats. That's a good one. Perfect straight line.
[20033.56s -> 20045.25s]  Right in the middle. Alright I got to go to the meerkats.
[20045.25s -> 20049.62s]  What hole are they in? I'm just going to hide. Maybe I shouldn't park the jeep in front of the holes.
[20049.62s -> 20068.95s]  That's good. So let's wait. I'm going to put the binoculars out.
[20068.95s -> 20072.95s]  That's a good spot. Is there a tree I can climb or something? What about up here?
[20072.95s -> 20082.50s]  Can I get up there? No that's a wall. It's an actual wall that I can't climb.
[20082.50s -> 20086.50s]  Why can't I just stand on the jeep? That seems like a perfectly
[20086.50s -> 20104.85s]  swell place to stand. Look at the angle.
[20104.85s -> 20111.25s]  Just park the jeep over the holes. What kind of monster are you?
[20111.25s -> 20115.68s]  No I'm just going to sit here. I'm going to wait until one shows their head.
[20115.68s -> 20142.12s]  And I'm going to whip the camera out and snap. They pop up right?
[20142.12s -> 20156.37s]  Come on. Are they just holes? Just look for other holes.
[20156.37s -> 20165.57s]  Maybe. Alright let me look for other holes.
[20165.57s -> 20186.24s]  Don't run across. Don't run across. What are you doing?
[20186.24s -> 20190.24s]  Break the truck. You cannot unfortunately. I wish you could.
[20190.24s -> 20196.96s]  That would have definitely caused some damage.
[20196.96s -> 20207.65s]  Kobe Sand. Some other type of animal here.
[20207.65s -> 20213.17s]  Tigers? Lions? There's got to be a lion in this game. You can't have it take photos
[20213.17s -> 20217.17s]  of animals game and not have a lion in this area.
[20217.17s -> 20235.27s]  There's no way. Can I climb this tree? It's a pretty good view but there's nothing
[20235.27s -> 20243.06s]  here. What the hell is that? No it's just a random animal.
[20243.06s -> 20250.61s]  A bird? What kind of bird is that? Is that like a pheasant?
[20250.61s -> 20261.17s]  That is the equivalent of a bird Chadwalk. It's
[20261.17s -> 20285.70s]  gold too. We've got to take a picture of the golden bird. It's just a dumb
[20285.70s -> 20295.11s]  vulture. Okay. What's supposed to be over here?
[20295.11s -> 20308.18s]  I think it's a meerkat but let's go back and turn some of these in.
[20308.18s -> 20312.18s]  The meerkats are too scared to come out of their burrow. There must be a way. Let's request new equipment from the head office.
[20312.18s -> 20325.88s]  I couldn't do anything. Give me a break. I took a lot of pictures didn't I?
[20325.88s -> 20332.61s]  Alright we've got our email. We're going to do wildlife research. Any new animals?
[20332.61s -> 20338.64s]  We have a few. What's a good one?
[20338.64s -> 20348.95s]  Golden vulture.
[20348.95s -> 20353.51s]  Why are the bird pictures with bad framing?
[20353.51s -> 20364.85s]  This is one of the most highly sought after images.
[20364.85s -> 20372.10s]  We've got the good class picture of the ostrich.
[20372.10s -> 20377.03s]  This has got to be a full block for everything right?
[20377.03s -> 20382.74s]  God damn it. Distance by a hair and technique by a hair.
[20382.74s -> 20394.72s]  Oh well. Okay let's see. There's the photo bomb. I'm going to keep that one.
[20394.72s -> 20400.04s]  This one sucks. This one's kind of cool but sucks.
[20400.04s -> 20404.28s]  I don't know what this picture is of. I was trying to go for some artsy
[20404.28s -> 20408.28s]  stuff with everything in the foreground was out of focus.
[20408.28s -> 20413.80s]  They were in focus but my subject was not cooperating.
[20413.80s -> 20430.36s]  That one's not bad. I like this one.
[20430.36s -> 20451.94s]  That one's good. This one's fine. That's a good one.
[20451.94s -> 20463.14s]  That one causes a headache. I'm progressively trying to change
[20463.14s -> 20468.98s]  the aperture and the shutter. See typically
[20468.98s -> 20474.10s]  you go through and you delete all these. It slowly gets better
[20474.10s -> 20478.10s]  and then you got the fucking money shot which is right here.
[20478.10s -> 20486.04s]  This one actually is more pleasing to me. Let them evaluate
[20486.04s -> 20494.87s]  this one? No. The same bird? It is.
[20494.87s -> 20499.43s]  That's pretty great. Can't you just see a logo
[20499.43s -> 20503.91s]  right in the middle there? That's perfect template
[20503.91s -> 20515.43s]  for two or three words for your business.
[20515.43s -> 20522.79s]  I think that's a better one too. That's pretty good. I think that works for what they're looking for.
[20522.79s -> 20532.02s]  Come on, give me a perfect. God damn it.
[20532.02s -> 20540.36s]  Then there was one more photo of an animal.
[20540.36s -> 20548.85s]  Where is it? No, not the baby running away scared.
[20548.85s -> 20554.42s]  Maybe that's it. No, that's it.
[20554.42s -> 20561.20s]  Let's delete some of these. These are
[20561.20s -> 20565.20s]  terrible. I like both of these. I'm keeping both.
[20565.20s -> 20569.76s]  This one's dumb. Don't like it. Don't want any of these.
[20569.76s -> 20574.84s]  None of these are worth saving. None of these are worth saving.
[20574.84s -> 20578.84s]  It's just a job. You know what I mean? No, don't get rid of the
[20578.84s -> 20586.08s]  advertising template. But here's the
[20586.08s -> 20591.03s]  marketing template. It's good to
[20591.03s -> 20595.03s]  have two templates because this giraffe is paying attention to
[20595.03s -> 20599.03s]  whatever the company or logo is in the middle of the screen. This giraffe
[20599.03s -> 20603.03s]  is paying attention to you. It cares about you and your interests.
[20603.03s -> 20607.52s]  So the logo on the screen is there for the company but this giraffe is endorsing it
[20607.52s -> 20611.52s]  and looking to you on how you feel about it.
[20611.52s -> 20628.10s]  Instead of what the giraffe feels about the company. I'll keep them both.
[20628.10s -> 20638.98s]  I'll get rid of this one. Keep that one. I'm gonna run out of space. Any more space?
[20638.98s -> 20648.95s]  Keep that one. Okay, delete. I'm assuming we're probably gonna get
[20648.95s -> 20657.65s]  a mission. But the giraffe could also
[20657.65s -> 20661.65s]  symbolize a person targeted by the advertisement so the one with it looking at the logo would be better.
[20661.65s -> 20667.09s]  Could be. That's all on the marketing firm that
[20667.09s -> 20672.92s]  decides to pay for those pictures. I'm just the photographer.
[20672.92s -> 20679.14s]  They interpret, not me. Oh, there's a lot here. Thanks for the other day.
[20679.14s -> 20684.40s]  Amazing animals editorial desk. My boss loved the giraffe photo. Thanks for
[20684.40s -> 20688.64s]  saving my bacon. Hey, by the way, have you ever seen ostriches court
[20688.64s -> 20692.64s]  each other? If not, you should check it out. It's quite a spectacle.
[20692.64s -> 20696.64s]  And by check it out, I mean snap me a photo. I'll use it in next month's Amazing
[20696.64s -> 20710.08s]  Animals. Cute little animal request.
[20710.08s -> 20714.08s]  One of the companies sponsoring our project requested you send a photo of a meerkat standing
[20714.08s -> 20718.45s]  up and looking around. However, you won't find a more vigilant
[20718.45s -> 20722.45s]  watchman than a meerkat. You'll have a rough time sneaking up on one without being noticed.
[20722.45s -> 20727.46s]  What was it just eating in that last frame? Oh,
[20727.46s -> 20731.83s]  the stick. Okay. Luckily, we were ready for this and have prepared new equipment
[20731.83s -> 20735.83s]  for you. Use it to get the photo. I can't do that now.
[20735.83s -> 20740.39s]  Doing the ostriches having sex with each other.
[20740.39s -> 20746.34s]  An animal that has a funny face. Hey, can you take a photo for our next issue?
[20746.34s -> 20750.71s]  We're doing a favorite funny animal faces. And I want you to put a picture
[20750.71s -> 20754.71s]  of a heart beast in the running. They have those long
[20754.71s -> 20758.71s]  slender faces. If you got a shot from head on, our readers would vote at number one, no
[20758.71s -> 20768.77s]  question. I deleted them all. Alright, I gotta get a good one of the funny
[20768.77s -> 20775.62s]  face. Trap cam on its way. Head office is sending
[20775.62s -> 20779.62s]  you new equipment. The trap cam lets you photograph subjects remotely.
[20779.62s -> 20783.62s]  Set up the camera where you want to take a photo, then trigger the shutter from a distance.
[20783.62s -> 20788.31s]  Feel free to use the trap cam for other research after you finish
[20788.31s -> 20792.80s]  taking the meerkat photo. Alright. Francine never heard of
[20792.80s -> 20796.80s]  the big five. There are five major animals people want to see on safaris.
[20796.80s -> 20800.80s]  The African elephant, the African buffalo, the rhino, the leopard, and the lion.
[20800.80s -> 20804.80s]  They're all tough to find, though. You'd have to be pretty lucky to spot them all.
[20804.80s -> 20811.59s]  Oh, there's the rare spawn. Alright, uh, ostrich is
[20811.59s -> 20817.41s]  doing courting. Okay. How do I
[20817.41s -> 20822.55s]  use? The male slowly rotates its wings and moves its head into figure
[20822.55s -> 20829.35s]  eight. It's quite exotic. How do I use the
[20829.35s -> 20837.17s]  trap cam? Shoot photos from a distance using infrared remote, custom for
[20837.17s -> 20841.17s]  tsetse cameras. How do I use it?
[20841.17s -> 20868.21s]  Wait a minute. I got the wrong camera. Oh, I don't want to do that. Ten hour joker?
[20868.21s -> 20879.30s]  It's the amateur camera. Alright, let's go with ostriches.
[20879.30s -> 20884.87s]  Ostriches. It's weird to say that name.
[20884.87s -> 20890.84s]  Ostriches. Hard to pronounce. Ostrich.
[20890.84s -> 20915.22s]  Ostrich. Okay. Capturing ostrich
[20915.22s -> 20921.88s]  in a mating ritual. Can't I just skip?
[20921.88s -> 20937.64s]  You can't put a base camp up in the other areas.
[20937.64s -> 20954.53s]  GTA bushes. Yeah, they're pretty bad.
[20954.53s -> 20960.55s]  So which way is the place we just worked? This way?
[20960.55s -> 20990.74s]  Fucking god. Do we have a problem in chat? Do we have
[20990.74s -> 20996.90s]  a problem right now in chat? Am I getting baited here or is this
[20996.90s -> 21000.90s]  actually the day that I get rid of links forever?
[21000.90s -> 21005.65s]  Okay. Alright, that's fine. Just remember,
[21005.65s -> 21024.29s]  the boy of fried wolf. Open it. I'm not going to open it.
[21024.29s -> 21036.21s]  I don't want to open it. Don't crash into that. It's going to stop you.
[21037.21s -> 21047.98s]  What is he going to do? Do I really have to go from the wetlands
[21047.98s -> 21051.98s]  to through the wetlands? Up through the other place.
[21051.98s -> 21068.38s]  Into the desert area. Do I actually have to do that?
[21068.38s -> 21082.78s]  Long loading screens. Guys, let's act like his camera's on.
[21082.78s -> 21099.93s]  His cam's on. That's not a fake message somebody actually wrote that.
[21099.93s -> 21114.75s]  What the fuck, dude?
[21114.75s -> 21120.08s]  No one said yes they did. Check the logs. Somebody wrote that.
[21120.08s -> 21128.80s]  Let's pretend. Oh, was it all capitals? That's why I turned that on.
[21128.80s -> 21138.01s]  Alright, we need an ostrich mating ritual.
[21138.01s -> 21155.08s]  Somebody did say that. I have the logs.
[21155.08s -> 21172.32s]  Show the logs? I'm not going to show logs. I don't have any logs.
[21172.32s -> 21178.80s]  It was a lie. I have a memory. Alright, get out.
[21178.80s -> 21186.94s]  See if there's a ritual right here. They moved the head into figure 8.
[21186.94s -> 21193.34s]  Like that? Is that one about to do it?
[21193.34s -> 21197.64s]  Is this one about to do the thing? He turned his head upside down.
[21197.64s -> 21209.85s]  He's going to do the thing. He's about to do it. I've got to get closer than that.
[21209.85s -> 21213.85s]  It looks like somebody squished his neck. Somebody accidentally stepped on his neck.
[21213.85s -> 21244.56s]  No. I wonder. Alright, you like Donald Duck.
[21244.56s -> 21273.04s]  Go find another Donald Duck. And let's get this over with.
[21273.04s -> 21278.43s]  Why are you not taking this moment to make a funny animal documentary?
[21278.43s -> 21284.65s]  What do you want me to say?
[21284.65s -> 21298.11s]  I already did that joke five years ago.
[21298.11s -> 21302.67s]  Okay, you want me to go like this. As you can see here,
[21302.67s -> 21306.67s]  the giraffe is drinking from the water. And to the left...
[21306.67s -> 21315.45s]  Here it is in action right now. It's doing like a turkey dance.
[21315.45s -> 21321.02s]  Alright, that's what I need to get. I got it already. That's what you guys wanted.
[21321.02s -> 21343.48s]  You don't want that. You'll do it again. So is this game any fun or is this whole
[21343.48s -> 21350.28s]  stream just a bit? That would be pretty long.
[21350.28s -> 21358.80s]  Six straight hours of a bit.
[21358.80s -> 21362.80s]  That's the whole stream. Been a bit. I got it.
[21362.80s -> 21371.58s]  Who cares if it's not worth anything?
[21371.58s -> 21375.58s]  You can't even see it. It's a very bad photo. This one's about to do it, right?
[21375.58s -> 21380.91s]  They get down on their knees and they start moving around in a circle.
[21380.91s -> 21390.20s]  They float their feathers out and they start moving their head around. I've got to get in front of them.
[21390.20s -> 21401.21s]  Have I tried only talking when I have something funny to say?
[21401.21s -> 21409.66s]  Why the hell would I do that?
[21409.66s -> 21413.66s]  If I would have just sit here silently, it would just be watching
[21413.66s -> 21417.66s]  a silent gameplay of PlayStation 3 safari photos.
[21417.66s -> 21435.39s]  Why in the name of fucking God would I ever do that?
[21435.39s -> 21488.89s]  Alright, I'll try it. I'll make it really...
[21488.89s -> 21492.89s]  This is not a joke. Hey, what's up guys? Chime in here. This is not a joke.
[21492.89s -> 21496.89s]  Did you guys actually know that the ostrich is one of the most closely
[21496.89s -> 21501.96s]  related animal to dinosaurs?
[21501.96s -> 21545.69s]  If I would have walked into my room right now and not...
[21545.69s -> 21549.69s]  I wasn't streaming this. This is a really weird fucking game.
[21549.69s -> 21553.69s]  Just to be playing. Just here.
[21553.69s -> 21558.89s]  I know it's not funny, but it is. Silently playing this game.
[21558.89s -> 21571.24s]  It feels weird to play this game in silence.
[21571.24s -> 21577.07s]  It just does. I'm sorry. You're not going to silence me.
[21577.07s -> 21592.43s]  It's immersing. Fine. Five straight minutes
[21592.43s -> 21812.99s]  of silence. I got something funny to say. That's a workout video.
[21812.99s -> 21816.99s]  That's a workout video. And I just got a picture of a workout video.
[21816.99s -> 21839.63s]  That's funny. I got it. Five more minutes. I can't fucking do it.
[21839.63s -> 21850.64s]  I only have three minutes. How was it? I'm not going to say that?
[21850.64s -> 21854.64s]  Alright, I can fucking do it. I'm doing it. I don't care if there's anything funny to say. I'm not going to say anything.
[21854.64s -> 21858.64s]  I swear to God. Five fucking minutes. I'm not going to talk. I'm not going to smirk
[21858.64s -> 21862.64s]  staring at the fucking screen playing my silent video game.
[21862.64s -> 21872.56s]  I'm going to keep the mic on this time so I can prove it.
[21872.56s -> 21877.37s]  Here it goes. Here it goes. Here it goes. Here it goes. Shut up. I already blew it.
[21877.37s -> 21882.19s]  It's already over. Start again. Right now. Go.
[21882.19s -> 21890.59s]  I already got the... I got to get in front of them. Shhh.
[21890.59s -> 21975.95s]  Starting now. Nothing was even fucking funny.
[21975.95s -> 21979.95s]  I just started rifling through things in my head that were funny.
[21979.95s -> 21984.64s]  I don't know why my brain was trying to make me lose.
[21984.64s -> 21988.64s]  You know when you're in class and the teacher's like, everybody shut the fuck up.
[21988.64s -> 21992.64s]  Anyone peeps at all and that's it. You're going to have detention.
[21992.64s -> 21996.64s]  And you shut the fuck up and you're like, I don't want to get in trouble. And then you think of every funny thing
[21996.64s -> 22000.64s]  you've ever heard of in your life. Your brain just starts to talk.
[22000.64s -> 22004.64s]  Things that have nothing to do with what you just heard. What might have been funny five minutes ago.
[22004.64s -> 22008.64s]  You fell off your skateboard and you bumped your head on a wall
[22008.64s -> 22012.94s]  or something in the ninth grade and it was like hilarious.
[22012.94s -> 22016.94s]  Like somebody puked in front of you when you were like fucking fourteen and you were like laughing your ass off.
[22016.94s -> 22028.48s]  Those images come into your mind. That just happened. I'm going to get it.
[22028.48s -> 22037.52s]  I'm going to get it. Let's go. Three, two, one, go.
[22037.52s -> 22042.65s]  What? No, I'm talking about like if I like... You ever like bumped into something and like you knocked over
[22042.65s -> 22069.08s]  like a fucking cabinet and it's not funny? Yeah, a whole cabinet.
[22069.08s -> 22073.96s]  I'm sorry guys, but in eighth grade typing class
[22073.96s -> 22078.46s]  somebody puking on their computer all over the keys. How would you react to that?
[22078.46s -> 22099.45s]  Like holy shit. But that didn't even happen to me.
[22099.45s -> 22105.87s]  That happened to my father. That's a story from my father.
[22105.87s -> 22109.87s]  My father did that. I wasn't in the classroom.
[22109.87s -> 22118.14s]  He ate like pecan pie and fucking threw up all over his computer.
[22118.14s -> 22122.14s]  Wait, this might have been a lie that my father told me.
[22122.14s -> 22126.14s]  Because they didn't have computers back then, did they?
[22126.14s -> 22135.36s]  Was it computers back in like the fucking 70s? He's going for it.
[22135.36s -> 22149.24s]  He's going for it. He's going for it. How bad is the picture that I took?
[22149.24s -> 22158.09s]  It doesn't matter. It looks like shit, but who cares? Yeah, there was a typing class.
[22158.09s -> 22162.09s]  I'm going to text him tomorrow and be like, hey, did you have a computer?
[22162.09s -> 22166.09s]  Did the pecan pie throw up all over the keyboard story real or did you make that up?
[22166.09s -> 22190.30s]  I'm going to get the whole story. I've been here for so long trying to take pictures of these fucking...
[22190.30s -> 22197.42s]  I was going to say elves. Every funny thing I've ever heard of is happening
[22197.42s -> 22201.42s]  right now in my brain. Everything that I've ever thought was funny
[22201.42s -> 22205.42s]  is all mashing together into one made-up fucking story.
[22205.42s -> 22221.05s]  I think that's actually what's happening because I can't shut the fuck up
[22221.05s -> 22239.29s]  for five minutes. Are you going for it? It's good practice. Okay, I'm going to try
[22239.29s -> 22243.29s]  it again. This is the real one. This one's no more fucking wrong. I swear to God. I promise.
[22243.29s -> 22247.29s]  100% guarantee. If I crack, I will give a hundred
[22247.29s -> 22251.79s]  gift subs if I fucking crack. Five minutes starting now. Let's go.
[22251.79s -> 22510.33s]  God damn it.
[22510.33s -> 22514.89s]  Okay, two things. One, the ostriches were walking in exact succession
[22514.89s -> 22520.41s]  into my lens. It got silent and y'all hear it was... and then I crashed the same
[22520.41s -> 22524.41s]  fucking bush that had crashed into like a hundred times.
[22524.41s -> 22538.30s]  How long was that? That's four minutes?
[22538.30s -> 22572.44s]  Photo finish. How many subs was it? Fifty?
[22572.44s -> 22604.75s]  Oh, God damn it.
[22604.75s -> 22608.75s]  I had it too. It was fine. I swallowed that bullshit and then I drove into the same
[22608.75s -> 22625.66s]  fucking bush I've driven into every single goddamn time. Alright, how do I fucking do this
[22625.66s -> 22631.88s]  again? God damn it. Is it a hundred subs?
[22631.88s -> 22635.88s]  The last time I did this was bingo, like four months ago.
[22635.88s -> 22645.37s]  This doesn't count as like money laundering, right? No, it doesn't count because I just
[22645.37s -> 22653.95s]  lose money. Let me get to the channel. Double or nothing? Double or
[22653.95s -> 22661.05s]  nothing. Two hundred gifted subs if I can't do it.
[22661.05s -> 22666.32s]  Two fucking hundred. Double
[22666.32s -> 22670.94s]  or nothing for ten minutes. No, it's never gonna happen.
[22670.94s -> 22675.31s]  That will never happen. I can guarantee that.
[22675.31s -> 22679.80s]  Oh, for ten minutes I can do it. Oh, God damn it.
[22679.80s -> 22687.93s]  No, I'm like, we're gonna giggly and laugh right now. It's not gonna work.
[22687.93s -> 22691.93s]  It should be five. Yeah, no, double or nothing. The time is the same. Ten minutes
[22691.93s -> 22697.84s]  is no way. I can't fucking close my mouth for ten minutes.
[22697.84s -> 22701.84s]  Like, in four minutes I put my hands up and I laugh at my fingers sometimes.
[22701.84s -> 22705.84s]  Like, you're not gonna work. I'm one of the fucking weasels from Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
[22705.84s -> 22712.12s]  It's not gonna happen. It's hard because I know I see chat like
[22712.12s -> 22716.12s]  over here in the corner of my eye. I'm not even paying attention to you guys. And all I see, I see,
[22716.12s -> 22720.12s]  I can feel what you guys are writing. Somebody wrote like fucking
[22720.12s -> 22724.12s]  brap. And I don't think that's funny. And like, I fucking
[22724.12s -> 22728.12s]  just like, I can feel that word. And it's just like
[22728.12s -> 22735.82s]  fuck, I turn off the monitor. Alright, here we go.
[22735.82s -> 22739.82s]  Double or nothing. Five, same time. Five minutes, two hundred gifted subs
[22739.82s -> 22743.82s]  if I don't fucking do it. I'm getting ready for this one. I'm gonna think about like fucking just
[22743.82s -> 22748.00s]  I'm gonna think about like, you know what I'm gonna think about? I'm gonna think about like fucking bad,
[22748.00s -> 22754.91s]  mean stuff. This is that crying fucking
[22754.91s -> 22758.91s]  face. I'm just gonna make sure that I don't do anything fucking, I gotta get it out
[22758.91s -> 22764.36s]  of me. I'm just gonna put a picture of something, no, because I think it's funny after like a minute or
[22764.36s -> 22768.36s]  two. I snap a mirror cap, I gotta get that off the screen. I gotta get you guys off the screen.
[22768.36s -> 22774.78s]  Alright, two hundred gifted subs if I don't do this in another five minutes. But
[22774.78s -> 22778.78s]  hold on, I gotta think of everything that's ever funny right now and I gotta laugh about it.
[22778.78s -> 22787.37s]  Alright, here we go. Five minutes, double or nothing, two hundred subs if I don't
[22787.37s -> 22795.24s]  get it, I'm already gonna fucking up. Alright, we gotta get an official
[22795.24s -> 22799.24s]  time. I can see it at the timer right here. We're at six, twenty, twenty
[22799.24s -> 22803.24s]  seven. So at the top of the minute here, at six hours and twenty one minutes
[22803.24s -> 22807.24s]  screen, but that's where it begins. No talking, no bursts,
[22807.24s -> 22812.00s]  just, I'm turning the fucking screen off. I don't even see you guys.
[22812.00s -> 22818.12s]  No, that's cheating. Here we go. The minute's about
[22818.12s -> 22822.68s]  to turn here. Somebody, okay, I'm not looking to fucking chat ever again.
[22822.68s -> 22830.24s]  Here it comes, three,
[22830.24s -> 22855.52s]  two, triple or nothing, triple
[22855.52s -> 22861.42s]  or nothing, three hundred, three hundred if I can't do it.
[22861.42s -> 22865.79s]  Triple or nothing on the table. I can't have you guys here.
[22865.79s -> 22869.79s]  I see like fucking faces over here. I know you guys are fucking with me.
[22869.79s -> 22874.72s]  Triple or nothing, three hundred gifted subs if I don't get it, five minutes.
[22874.72s -> 22884.24s]  Triple or nothing, ready?
[22884.24s -> 23463.68s]  Five minutes, triple or nothing. I told you I could fucking do it.
[23463.68s -> 23468.24s]  I said to bring five grand to the casino and put a thousand dollars
[23468.24s -> 23472.24s]  in and lose it in one hand, put two thousand and lose it, and then put
[23472.24s -> 23476.24s]  three thousand, two thousand and then win. No, you bring five
[23476.24s -> 23480.24s]  thousand dollars to the casino, put a five hundred dollar hand on blackjack, you lose it.
[23480.24s -> 23484.48s]  Two thousand dollar hand on blackjack, you lose it. Fucking another
[23484.48s -> 23493.18s]  twenty-five hundred hand on blackjack, you hit it, get out, go home. Did I get the photo?
[23493.18s -> 23501.96s]  I got the photo, let's get out of here. Quadruple or nothing, I already did it.
[23501.96s -> 23511.95s]  What would that, that would have been, that would have been what, like
[23511.95s -> 23516.25s]  fucking fifteen hundred dollars spent with what, three hundred subs.
[23516.25s -> 23523.48s]  So, if it's like two grand,
[23523.48s -> 23535.18s]  holy fuck, fifteen hundred.
[23535.18s -> 23541.92s]  What the hell are we even doing on this stream anymore? Is it time to go?
[23541.92s -> 23556.97s]  Well, it is off the camera, that's for sure. No, you should have, the people that were saying double or nothing
[23556.97s -> 23567.72s]  should have just let me sleep in my bed. Let's give them the photo.
[23567.72s -> 23581.16s]  What's wrong with the controller? Nobody said triple or nothing, yeah, but I was
[23581.16s -> 23590.64s]  panicking. This is the best one.
[23590.64s -> 23595.32s]  We don't want you to lose money. It's alright.
[23595.32s -> 23604.16s]  Cute animal request. I gained viewers doing that.
[23604.16s -> 23611.53s]  There were like twenty-seven hundred people here when I started doing that.
[23611.53s -> 23616.73s]  And now there's like thirty-two hundred. If you lost triple or nothing, would you have done quadruple?
[23616.73s -> 23626.65s]  No, that's strike three. That's to be standing?
[23626.65s -> 23633.32s]  Oh, fuck, it does. Triple or nothing, cause that is strike four, you can't go strike
[23633.32s -> 23652.40s]  four. That's not how that works. Technically standing.
[23652.40s -> 23656.40s]  People logged on their Smurf Twitch account to get the free sub.
[23660.17s -> 23666.32s]  Quadruple or nothing? No, man.
[23666.32s -> 23671.24s]  No way. After triple or nothing, that's it.
[23671.24s -> 23675.24s]  I broke even at the casino and my heart is
[23675.24s -> 23679.24s]  in my fucking stomach and I'm slowly going to walk out of the casino and be like
[23679.24s -> 23693.77s]  holy fuck, I'm never doing that again.
[23693.77s -> 23698.40s]  Two thousand dollar joke. Well, yeah, technically I would be
[23698.40s -> 23702.40s]  paying, I would just be giving Twitch money. Like I would just be giving the money.
[23702.40s -> 23709.58s]  I did that before. How about just for fun?
[23709.58s -> 23727.84s]  Let me save the game first. Then I would inflate my
[23727.84s -> 23733.29s]  sub count and then in a month it would come back down.
[23733.29s -> 23740.48s]  People are leaving. It's alright, we're getting to the end anyways.
[23740.48s -> 23744.65s]  In fact, we're probably going to call pretty soon here. It's been about
[23744.65s -> 23768.65s]  seven hours. Logging out of their Smurfs.
[23768.65s -> 23773.92s]  You're going to play a stunt like that and then go? I would have done it.
[23773.92s -> 23794.41s]  If I had lost on that third time, I would have done it.
[23794.41s -> 23801.85s]  A stunt like five minutes of silence.
[23821.00s -> 23842.76s]  Alright, where are we going? Let me just take a pee break. I'll be right back.
[23842.76s -> 23967.07s]  Let me just take a quick piss break. Alright, guys.
[23967.07s -> 23971.44s]  I guess it's going to happen. I'm going to give you a consolation prize. 50 community subs
[23971.44s -> 23992.89s]  coming out right now. Psych? No, there they come.
[23992.89s -> 24008.32s]  Generous streamer says, you know what, to the casino. Take my money anyway.
[24008.32s -> 24020.91s]  Congratulations, whoever gets it. I'm going to change my monitor here. Hey, hey, thanks a lot
[24020.91s -> 24035.32s]  German985. He's pretending. That's not pretending.
[24035.32s -> 24048.01s]  What the fuck? Holy shit! 50 community subs!
[24048.01s -> 24061.84s]  You know, I bet too much money. I bet too much.
[24061.84s -> 24067.16s]  And it's all good, because half of that money doesn't even come back.
[24067.16s -> 24079.96s]  That was fun. You guys got the house edge.
[24079.96s -> 24083.96s]  Even if you played a casino, if I was putting three grand
[24083.96s -> 24088.20s]  on the line there, even if I didn't lose,
[24088.20s -> 24092.20s]  even if you played blackjack perfectly, that's still a one or two percent house edge.
[24092.20s -> 24099.32s]  You know? Egotistic streamer
[24099.32s -> 24104.14s]  donates money to himself and demands thanks for it.
[24104.14s -> 24114.57s]  And I think with
[24114.57s -> 24118.57s]  that, I think I'm going to call it there. I think that's a good enough to go
[24118.57s -> 24122.88s]  out on. Did about seven hours. Gonna take us about an hour to go through the bits.
[24122.88s -> 24126.88s]  Oh my fucking god. Wait, wait, why did you match me? No, you just gave
[24126.88s -> 24130.88s]  the money back. No, you gave me, you gave the house, the casino just gave me the
[24130.88s -> 24138.12s]  house edge back. You weren't supposed to match me.
[24138.12s -> 24142.12s]  Well, there it is. There's your 100 community subs, guys, from me failing it the first time.
[24142.12s -> 24149.80s]  There you go. That first failure when I said 100,
[24149.80s -> 24153.80s]  there it is. I decided to get matched by ha ha ha ha.
[24153.80s -> 24160.59s]  Kumo, Chi Chi, thank you for the 50
[24160.59s -> 24169.31s]  matched community subs to make it a hummy. The promise was
[24169.31s -> 24173.31s]  delivered, if it wasn't me, completely. Only two, and that's not true, only
[24173.31s -> 24189.12s]  200 more to go. No, that's 100. Yeah, that was a lot of fun.
[24189.12s -> 24193.12s]  We're gonna take off here now. That's a good time. That's a good note to close it out on.
[24193.12s -> 24197.48s]  That was an interesting thing to close it out on. That was Africa.
[24197.48s -> 24202.03s]  It was a fun game. Relaxing.
[24202.03s -> 24206.03s]  Hard to keep a straight face when you silently sit in there.
[24206.03s -> 24211.48s]  And so the plan for the next couple days is
[24211.48s -> 24215.85s]  I really have to play this by ear. Cause I really don't know what the scenario is
[24215.85s -> 24220.16s]  gonna be, cause like I said, when Italics and I are both trying to
[24220.16s -> 24224.16s]  stream at the same time, or try to use the internet at the same time, sometimes
[24224.16s -> 24228.16s]  it just fucking kills the whole thing. So it seems to be
[24228.16s -> 24232.16s]  fixed though, at least in a packet loss frame drop kind of way.
[24232.16s -> 24236.16s]  But we might have another issue entirely.
[24236.16s -> 24240.16s]  So tomorrow, I plan on streaming Vive tomorrow, but just
[24240.16s -> 24244.33s]  stay, stay alert! Cause around
[24244.33s -> 24248.33s]  the stream time tomorrow, around like 2 to 3 PM,
[24248.33s -> 24252.33s]  I'm gonna be around to give you guys an update on what's actually happening.
[24252.33s -> 24256.33s]  Who knows, this might just be a random fluke of a day.
[24256.33s -> 24261.07s]  Oh, B or B, that's not true. This might be like a random day
[24261.07s -> 24265.07s]  that's a fluke, where I get a green light for like 7 hours for no reason.
[24265.07s -> 24272.32s]  But, I'll see you maybe tomorrow?
[24272.32s -> 24278.27s]  I don't know. We'll find out.
[24278.27s -> 24282.27s]  Thanks for joining me ahead. That was a lot of fun. That was a fun, relaxing,
[24282.27s -> 24288.62s]  chill hangout stream. Thank you for the massive amount of
[24288.62s -> 24292.62s]  community subs, especially right at the end there from Ha Ha Ha.
[24292.62s -> 24301.39s]  Much love to you all. I'll see you all maybe tomorrow. I'll let you guys know
[24301.39s -> 24308.32s]  either on Twitter or here. And with that, let's do the bits. What do you say?
[24308.32s -> 24321.95s]  Let's pull it up here. Did I look into the OpenVR plugin?
[24321.95s -> 24326.51s]  Yeah, I have this OpenVR. There's a couple of other things. There's like a chat. I can do
[24326.51s -> 24330.51s]  chat, right? If I get a certain thing, I have chat on my hand. I've been looking
[24330.51s -> 24338.57s]  into a lot of them. Let's scroll back down to earlier this evening.
[24338.57s -> 24342.57s]  To 7 hours ago now. Just about 7-ish hours ago.
[24342.57s -> 24348.84s]  Yeah, OVR drop. Yeah. I'm going to try to get it set up.
[24348.84s -> 24352.84s]  The whole room is set up, so really it's just software stuff that I can do tonight and tomorrow.
[24352.84s -> 24359.39s]  But thank you Rise, Fall of Ziggy.
[24359.39s -> 24363.39s]  Thank you for the $5. Ziggy Stardust is the name.
[24363.39s -> 24367.39s]  This stream exists. Congratulations. Yeah. Yeah, for a like,
[24367.39s -> 24371.39s]  let's test the internet stream. I had a lot of fun. Hope you guys did too.
[24371.39s -> 24376.14s]  Timmy Tim Tim, thanks for the $1 play. Crazy Strike Bowling for a Nintendo
[24376.14s -> 24383.39s]  Switch. I gotta use my Switch more. I
[24383.39s -> 24387.63s]  started off doing a ton of Switch stuff. I haven't done it in such a long time.
[24387.63s -> 24392.44s]  It's been at least a couple months since I've even turned it on. But thank you Timmy Tim Tim.
[24392.44s -> 24396.68s]  Jared Roberts, thanks for the $15. Thanks for streaming
[24396.68s -> 24401.76s]  German Life is Difficult and Simple Streams can brighten it up.
[24401.76s -> 24407.58s]  Thank you so much for the $15. And yeah, it's
[24407.58s -> 24413.10s]  sometimes the little things are worth looking forward to.
[24413.10s -> 24418.84s]  Like taking photos of animals in Africa on the PlayStation 3.
[24418.84s -> 24425.24s]  But thank you so much for
[24425.24s -> 24430.32s]  the $15 Brad Roberts. Divus, thanks for the $2 Divus.
[24430.32s -> 24437.63s]  No message is Divus coming in always with a few dollars every stream. Thank you.
[24437.63s -> 24442.19s]  Dark Keegan, thanks for the $10.
[24442.19s -> 24446.19s]  Finally managed to catch a stream after starting my first job. Thanks for all the laughs. You're great.
[24446.19s -> 24451.88s]  Thank you. Thank you for the $10 and thank you for sticking around.
[24451.88s -> 24458.46s]  Glad you got to catch one. Maybe we'll see you again soon.
[24458.46s -> 24462.46s]  Mostly Lost, thanks for the $10. No, that's a $1 for Mostly Lost.
[24462.46s -> 24466.46s]  The game should work fine if you delete the streamer. That was 7 hours ago
[24466.46s -> 24470.70s]  and then somehow we came back to that 7 hours later.
[24470.70s -> 24477.23s]  Well, nice foreshadowing. We had 50
[24477.23s -> 24484.03s]  community subs from Great Canadian Fuck Club, right?
[24484.03s -> 24489.04s]  And then WhiffWiff gave a bunch to, there pretty much
[24489.04s -> 24493.04s]  was 200 or 300 community subs tonight. Just combined.
[24493.04s -> 24498.75s]  So double enough and triple enough and don't really matter. Thank you to both of you.
[24498.75s -> 24507.52s]  Mostly Lost also gave $50. I think I somehow
[24507.52s -> 24514.43s]  missed this. If you still hear Mostly Lost, thank you so much for your
[24514.43s -> 24521.74s]  large amount of money. Finally my missed bits.
[24521.74s -> 24527.13s]  I'm so sorry. What was I doing here? I don't know.
[24527.13s -> 24531.13s]  But thanks a lot, man. They say, here I assume this is what you paid for the game, so let me
[24531.13s -> 24536.65s]  reimburse you for it. Oh wait. The game was
[24536.65s -> 24540.65s]  just about, I think it was $50 total. Like $48 or something.
[24540.65s -> 24546.41s]  But thank you. German95, thanks for donating, dude.
[24546.41s -> 24554.88s]  What do I have for a sub count now? I have
[24554.88s -> 24559.82s]  over $5,800. It was almost $7,000
[24559.82s -> 24563.82s]  something, I think. I think it was just under $7,000. Was it $7,200
[24563.82s -> 24567.82s]  or something before? Like with the insane amount of community subs?
[24567.82s -> 24576.09s]  Yeah. There was like, I had over, was it over
[24576.09s -> 24580.72s]  $7,000 or was it up to, it's like $68 or something.
[24580.72s -> 24586.68s]  But we're at about $58. I think some of you guys, yeah $65.
[24586.68s -> 24590.68s]  There were so many community subs last month. It was ridiculous.
[24590.68s -> 24604.89s]  But thanks a lot, Mostly Lost. How do you handle the fluctuating
[24604.89s -> 24609.84s]  income as a streamer? Do you just live well below your income at any time?
[24609.84s -> 24615.23s]  Yeah, I mean, I just, I mean, for the most part
[24615.23s -> 24622.22s]  I think that as long as, like look, if you're paying your bills
[24622.22s -> 24626.22s]  and you pay for, you know, food and bills and
[24626.22s -> 24630.91s]  just because you're making, like I'm making
[24630.91s -> 24636.04s]  very, very good money from you guys. It's fucking insane.
[24636.04s -> 24642.40s]  But, I mean, living below your means, I mean,
[24642.40s -> 24646.40s]  five, six, seven, eight thousand subscriptions on Twitch. You talk, that's a ton
[24646.40s -> 24652.28s]  of money. So I just, you know, want to save
[24652.28s -> 24656.46s]  some money. I want to put a lot of money back into the stream, which is what I
[24656.46s -> 24660.46s]  try to do. I mean, I spend
[24660.46s -> 24665.34s]  a significant percentage of every dollar that I make from Twitch goes
[24665.34s -> 24669.34s]  back to, you know, studio shit and buying games and buying systems
[24669.34s -> 24678.44s]  and hiring people and so
[24678.44s -> 24682.68s]  I'd like to, because then there's another, I mean, obviously there's the realistic approach
[24682.68s -> 24687.18s]  too, right? Where, you know, if you make a really good amount of money
[24687.18s -> 24691.36s]  doing something like this, because it's such a
[24691.36s -> 24695.85s]  kind of volatile place, you know, like streaming and YouTube,
[24695.85s -> 24699.85s]  it's not like, oh, this is the amount of money that you're going to make and you're going to make that probably for
[24699.85s -> 24703.85s]  like five to ten years and maybe you could get a promotion, maybe that's the money you're going to make
[24703.85s -> 24708.86s]  for like two decades. Like, I have no idea. You know, there's really no way
[24708.86s -> 24712.86s]  to tell. So why not just try to
[24712.86s -> 24716.86s]  do what I can and save what I can and make as good of a stream
[24716.86s -> 24726.86s]  as I can while I'm here. But I'm along for the ride, however
[24726.86s -> 24732.64s]  long it takes. You know, wherever this train leads to, I'm
[24732.64s -> 24738.22s]  going to ride it. Let's just get on it, right? Like you might even go
[24738.22s -> 24743.42s]  way up in a couple months and then just drop off. No, yeah, it can. It can.
[24743.42s -> 24751.44s]  But I've been showered with such generosity
[24751.44s -> 24757.76s]  over the last year that I'm
[24757.76s -> 24762.64s]  I'm living well in my means. So thank you all for the
[24762.64s -> 24770.51s]  support for real. But hopefully that answers the question.
[24770.51s -> 24774.51s]  And let's go to... Kairatobi gave a shitload of community subs.
[24774.51s -> 24779.84s]  Winterly Parsley gave a bunch of community subs. It was like
[24779.84s -> 24793.02s]  fucking two or three hundred. That was a lot. A lot, a lot, a lot.
[24793.02s -> 24797.02s]  And then we had Lobotomized Teddy Bear gave a dollar. Jerma, I'm happy you're teaching chat about
[24797.02s -> 24801.02s]  African animals before they are all basically
[24801.02s -> 24805.02s]  dead in like 20 years. That's so morbid.
[24805.02s -> 24815.50s]  This is not... Oh, God.
[24815.50s -> 24824.35s]  Well, I hope you liked the elephant. Somebody mentioned about taxes. Yeah, I mean
[24824.35s -> 24828.35s]  there's taxes on every dollar that I make from Twitch.
[24828.35s -> 24834.75s]  You know, it's not just like, oh, this is the amount
[24834.75s -> 24838.75s]  of money you make from a sub and that's yours. You get to keep. No, there's taxes.
[24838.75s -> 24844.27s]  It's hard to do taxes when you just sort of completely
[24844.27s -> 24848.27s]  have 1099 as income is what it's called. So it can get like sloppy
[24848.27s -> 24854.11s]  if you don't stay on top of it. But I've been doing just fine.
[24854.11s -> 24867.87s]  I have a good tax person. I talk to them all the time. As long as you stay
[24867.87s -> 24874.65s]  on top of it. Tax boy. But thank you Lobotomized Teddy Bear.
[24874.65s -> 24878.65s]  A Louis, thanks for the one dollar, or Louis with a large underscore.
[24878.65s -> 24883.60s]  Thank you. People possum thanks for the five bucks.
[24883.60s -> 24887.60s]  They say forehead. Hey Jerma, I'm donating blood on Monday and they're
[24887.60s -> 24891.77s]  replacing it all with pee. I'm very excited.
[24891.77s -> 24895.77s]  Well, unfortunately, I don't know if that's a great idea.
[24895.77s -> 24901.93s]  Why would they replace your blood with pee? Well, if the first part
[24901.93s -> 24905.93s]  is true, that's really, really kind of you and good of you to do.
[24905.93s -> 24911.90s]  Hopefully it goes to somebody that really needs it. So thank you for doing that if that's true.
[24911.90s -> 24916.40s]  For the pee part, I would probably not sign
[24916.40s -> 24921.15s]  that waiver. I'm not sure you should do that.
[24921.15s -> 24925.64s]  But thank you. Thank you Tar Alacrin for the one dollar. Hey Jerma, great gameplay today. Really
[24925.64s -> 24929.95s]  riveting. And they do a sarcastic I'm smiling face.
[24929.95s -> 24933.95s]  Anyways, have you considered playing one of those new fangled
[24933.95s -> 24937.95s]  randomizers like a Zelda game? That are all the rage these days.
[24937.95s -> 24941.95s]  If you are worried about getting lost, I don't think it would be distinguishable from you playing a game normally.
[24941.95s -> 24949.82s]  Hopefully we see a couple of ehe's from that one.
[24949.82s -> 24955.08s]  Randomize the stuff though. Once I'm done with everything else
[24955.08s -> 24960.01s]  that I want to do. There's a bunch of shit that I want to do.
[24960.01s -> 24964.01s]  I bought a bunch of PlayStation 2 games. I've got to
[24964.01s -> 24968.83s]  admit it to you guys. I just went on a PlayStation 2 spree
[24968.83s -> 24972.83s]  again. I bought like 10 more. Already on top of the fucking
[24972.83s -> 24978.80s]  10 that is still there to be played. So we're going to have to do another
[24978.80s -> 24982.80s]  PlayStation 2. I got the Jaws game where you play as the shark.
[24982.80s -> 24993.80s]  I just had to buy it. I had to get it.
[24993.80s -> 24999.58s]  The game is great. I know. There's a lot to do.
[24999.58s -> 25004.59s]  Thank you Binary Man for the $5.11. Sorry Jerma,
[25004.59s -> 25008.59s]  but I had to. To anyone who can actually play this properly, I apologize
[25008.59s -> 25012.59s]  for the bad playing, but I learned it on the spot while waiting for the
[25012.59s -> 25022.00s]  stream to start. Well, what is it?
[25022.00s -> 25037.42s]  It's a YouTube link. Stream in the corner.
[25037.42s -> 25056.56s]  That's it. That's the whole thing.
[25056.56s -> 25066.94s]  Thank you so much. That sounded pretty great.
[25066.94s -> 25074.73s]  Thank you Binary Man. Thank you Dork Cube for the $1.
[25074.73s -> 25078.73s]  Firefox and Twitch don't mix too well, so when I went to look at the emotes
[25078.73s -> 25082.73s]  and saw that you had what looked like 50 emotes that were all duplicates, I was
[25082.73s -> 25096.41s]  confused. What the fuck? That's a weird bug.
[25096.41s -> 25107.48s]  That's a very strange bug. That's a lot of emotes.
[25107.48s -> 25111.48s]  Thank you Dork Cube for the $1. Hey Flank Tank, thanks for the $10.
[25111.48s -> 25115.48s]  $10 from Flank Tank. Hey, I heard from a little safari birdie
[25115.48s -> 25119.48s]  that on February 26, Nier Automata was releasing its own
[25119.48s -> 25123.48s]  prepared to die Scholar of the First Sin version with all the DLC for I think half off.
[25123.48s -> 25127.48s]  Not sure what the other changes will be, but that might be a good time to look into it.
[25127.48s -> 25134.72s]  Jerma Venus. Sure.
[25134.72s -> 25142.73s]  I've never played it. I never played the other one. There's like a series, right?
[25142.73s -> 25149.53s]  There's like Nier, then there's Nier Automata.
[25149.53s -> 25156.46s]  I don't know really anything about them. All I know is that they exist.
[25156.46s -> 25160.46s]  But thank you for the suggestion. I did not know that was coming out. I will definitely
[25160.46s -> 25165.77s]  be looking into it. Thank you for the $10. Hey Swiggity Swanky, thanks for the $3.
[25165.77s -> 25173.13s]  This is your situation with cocks right now.
[25173.13s -> 25177.82s]  There are discs all over me. There are discs in every single part of my life right now.
[25177.82s -> 25181.82s]  There's a disc over here. There's a disc over here. I got discs in front of me.
[25181.82s -> 25186.76s]  I got discs all over me. Covered in discs.
[25186.76s -> 25191.63s]  He knew what he was doing.
[25191.63s -> 25195.63s]  He knew what he was doing there, making a joke. Don't let him fool you.
[25195.63s -> 25205.63s]  That's got at least 22 thumbs up on the
[25205.63s -> 25209.63s]  comments section. He knows what he's doing, guys.
[25209.63s -> 25222.56s]  But thank you Swiggity Swanky for the $3. Super sale thanks
[25222.56s -> 25226.56s]  for the $1. If a hippo woke you up in the middle of the night and personally asked you to pee
[25226.56s -> 25230.56s]  in their urinal mouth. Why are you asking me this?
[25230.56s -> 25235.80s]  The answer is no. I would call the police.
[25235.80s -> 25239.80s]  Jess, you got it. Thanks for the $1. After two weeks, I managed to finish editing that video
[25239.80s -> 25244.49s]  of all the sounds you made in January. And then it broke in rendering and I couldn't
[25244.49s -> 25248.49s]  save it. I'm disappointed because it was pretty funny and I don't want to start over
[25248.49s -> 25252.49s]  so here is one of my favorites from the list of 300.
[25252.49s -> 25257.50s]  I'm so sorry to hear that. That sucks.
[25257.50s -> 25269.08s]  Oh, that's Simpsons Hit and Run. I remember that. That's from the Simpsons Hit and Run.
[25269.08s -> 25276.96s]  Adam Sandler. The TIE fighter.
[25283.87s -> 25289.50s]  I'm really sorry to hear about that though. That's happened to me
[25289.50s -> 25293.50s]  quite a few times. Where in Premiere
[25293.50s -> 25297.50s]  you're working on something for like three days and then all of a sudden it fucks up and the
[25297.50s -> 25301.50s]  save doesn't work. Or like you spend three hours on something and then you
[25301.50s -> 25305.50s]  lose the three hours of it. You go back and you're like what the fuck. I don't even want to
[25305.50s -> 25309.50s]  do this again. And then you try to get more re-motivated to do the same cuts
[25309.50s -> 25313.50s]  the same edits that you just did already. It's awful.
[25313.50s -> 25318.30s]  So I'm really sorry to hear that happen. But thank you for the
[25318.30s -> 25327.21s]  attempt and thank you for the clip. And thank you C4G for the $4.83
[25327.21s -> 25331.21s]  and they say pride. Hey you
[25331.21s -> 25335.21s]  fucking gamer. And they say pride. Hey, thank you.
[25335.21s -> 25340.52s]  For the $4.83. C4G. I'd like to call myself
[25340.52s -> 25345.40s]  a gamer sometime. Hey future gamers. Thanks for the $1.00. How much
[25345.40s -> 25349.40s]  have you used the Vive already? Have you not even put it on yet? I have not
[25349.40s -> 25354.48s]  logged into any Vive related games.
[25354.48s -> 25358.48s]  I have done the setup. So I painted the room
[25358.48s -> 25362.48s]  with the hand. Like I did the perimeter. I got everything ready to go.
[25362.48s -> 25366.97s]  So I've not played a game in it yet. Because I want
[25366.97s -> 25373.95s]  my first experience to happen on stream. So it does
[25373.95s -> 25377.95s]  fit. It does work. It's just a question of getting into a game, capturing it
[25377.95s -> 25385.96s]  and streaming it. And we will see how that happens tomorrow.
[25385.96s -> 25389.96s]  Again, like I don't want to be this guy that sits here and tells you
[25389.96s -> 25393.96s]  there might be a stream tomorrow. But there might not. But there might be a stream. But there may be not a
[25393.96s -> 25398.52s]  stream tomorrow. That's unfortunately the way I have to look at it right now.
[25398.52s -> 25402.52s]  Until this is confirmed, which it hasn't been. The technician I'm
[25402.52s -> 25406.52s]  working with has not closed the ticket yet.
[25406.52s -> 25411.28s]  So until that ticket is closed and yes that issue
[25411.28s -> 25415.28s]  is resolved, I can't tell you that I can
[25415.28s -> 25419.28s]  that there's going to be a stream tomorrow. I don't know. Because like again,
[25419.28s -> 25423.28s]  Italic streams from this location too. So we
[25423.28s -> 25429.18s]  have to both use it. So I'm sorry to say
[25429.18s -> 25433.18s]  that I wish I could tell you it was going to happen. But I don't know. We might have to wait until the day.
[25433.18s -> 25439.53s]  We'll see. I'm optimistic. At least he kept the ticket open.
[25439.53s -> 25443.53s]  Yeah, he's going to keep it open until it's like completely confirmed
[25443.53s -> 25448.99s]  that it is done and closed. Future gamer, thanks for the $1.
[25448.99s -> 25452.99s]  Again, I cannot wait to watch you WWE chair shot someone
[25452.99s -> 25457.80s]  in Blade and Sorcery. I don't know what that means, but I'm
[25457.80s -> 25465.10s]  looking forward to it. Whatever that is. Thank you Jamona Cucumber
[25465.10s -> 25469.40s]  for the $2. Hey Jerma, I don't know if you remember when I made the LEGO Glue Man
[25469.40s -> 25473.40s]  render. Well I made a Sneak Man render that I posted in Creative and it was a bit
[25473.40s -> 25477.40s]  shit. So I came back and took a running leap at it. I present Mr.
[25477.40s -> 25488.11s]  LEGO Sneak Man Remastered. LEGO Sneak Man!
[25488.11s -> 25498.09s]  He's got these like ripped abs. LEGO really,
[25498.09s -> 25506.03s]  LEGO is one of those things that will always be a thing.
[25506.03s -> 25510.03s]  The test of time has passed over LEGOs and they are still
[25510.03s -> 25514.03s]  just as popular and still just as relevant as they were
[25514.03s -> 25528.56s]  20-30 years ago. It will always be relevant.
[25528.56s -> 25533.37s]  Thank you Jamona Cucumber, it's a great render. The Glue Man one was great as well.
[25533.37s -> 25539.47s]  And they got a comparison. They say hey if you want a comparison, here are the two comparisons.
[25539.47s -> 25550.60s]  Let's take a look. The second one is a little cleaner.
[25550.60s -> 25559.88s]  There's some better shading on the second one. Looks good.
[25559.88s -> 25565.60s]  Thank you for that. Are the LEGO movies
[25565.60s -> 25571.95s]  really good? Aren't they really highly rated movies? Like LEGO
[25571.95s -> 25575.95s]  Batman and LEGO Island. Not LEGO Island, LEGO World.
[25575.95s -> 25579.95s]  What was the LEGO movie? That had like a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes or
[25579.95s -> 25586.48s]  something. So I mean they're doing just fine. Thank you
[25586.48s -> 25590.48s]  Yes Is Online for the one dollar my face win and I realize that all elephants are clay.
[25590.48s -> 25606.56s]  What does your face do? What the fuck?
[25606.56s -> 25615.53s]  This is an Alex Jones and Death Grips
[25615.53s -> 25636.01s]  mashup. That's what this is. Link it, link, link.
[25636.01s -> 25645.36s]  Here, here, here, I'm giving it to you.
[25645.36s -> 25649.53s]  Thank you for that. Yes Is Online. My face win, all elephants are clay.
[25649.53s -> 25655.12s]  Freudian Weapon thanks for the eleven dollars. I could honestly write an essay about how inspirational
[25655.12s -> 25661.71s]  you've been to me. Thank you for the eleven dollars and I
[25661.71s -> 25665.71s]  can't believe that somebody would say something like that. So thank you so much.
[25665.71s -> 25669.71s]  I'm happy that you can find any inspiration from this stream or from the videos.
[25669.71s -> 25676.68s]  That means a lot. Thank you so much, Freudian. Thank you for the eleven dollars. Appreciate it.
[25676.68s -> 25683.10s]  Coming up to Colorblind Samurai thanks for the five dollars
[25683.10s -> 25687.47s]  and twelve cents. Hey Germans, just want to let you know that you mean a lot more to a lot of
[25687.47s -> 25691.47s]  us than you know. A year ago today my dad died of brain
[25691.47s -> 25695.47s]  cancer. Fuck cancer. And since then I've graduated from college, gotten a really
[25695.47s -> 25699.47s]  good job. But none of that would have been possible if I couldn't watch your streams and
[25699.47s -> 25703.47s]  vlogs to help me get back mentally from whatever shitty place I was in.
[25703.47s -> 25709.88s]  All the love I've got to you, man. I'm incredibly fucking sorry
[25709.88s -> 25716.99s]  to hear that. I'll tell you something right now though. Graduated from
[25716.99s -> 25727.48s]  college, got a great job. They'd be really fucking proud of you. Thank you
[25727.48s -> 25743.16s]  so much for being part of this community. And yeah, fuck cancer.
[25743.16s -> 25747.85s]  Hopefully someday soon we will get rid of that fucking awful, awful,
[25747.85s -> 25754.91s]  awful, awful thing forever. Thank you so much,
[25754.91s -> 25759.28s]  Colorblind Samurai for the five dollars and twelve cents. And I know I just kind of butchered
[25759.28s -> 25765.80s]  your name. But you know, that means a lot. That means a fucking lot.
[25765.80s -> 25781.55s]  I'm happy to be able to tell you that I
[25781.55s -> 25786.68s]  appreciate the fuck out of you being here. And if I can even give you a semblance, even a
[25786.68s -> 25790.68s]  second of happiness, in a place where you're not having a good time,
[25790.68s -> 25798.86s]  then fuck yeah. I'm happy to be there.
[25798.86s -> 25804.76s]  Thank you so much again for your five dollars and twelve cents. And yeah, fuck cancer.
[25804.76s -> 25819.60s]  For real. And congratulations on getting a good job. Cheers to
[25819.60s -> 25827.61s]  you. And moving on from that we've got Vroom had one dollar Vroom.
[25827.61s -> 25833.32s]  If you want to emulate video games you have to pretend that you're on the legit
[25833.32s -> 25839.87s]  hardware. L-U-L. Well that's not to do with pretending. If you want to emulate
[25839.87s -> 25844.43s]  video games you have to pretend that you're on the, no. The emulators just some
[25844.43s -> 25848.43s]  there's a whole list of games that can't run on those emulators.
[25848.43s -> 25853.12s]  And some of them that do are classified by the
[25853.12s -> 25863.24s]  community involved in trying to get them to work. I remember
[25863.24s -> 25867.24s]  I tried, I tried. This is not, this didn't happen on stream.
[25867.24s -> 25871.55s]  This happened, this was like a long time ago. Like two or three years ago.
[25871.55s -> 25876.04s]  It's not that long ago. But WWF No Mercy is one of my favorite Nintendo 64
[25876.04s -> 25880.86s]  games ever. I've owned that game like three times.
[25880.86s -> 25885.42s]  It's my favorite N64 game. Is that game.
[25885.42s -> 25890.35s]  Now, I wanted to play it, you know, a couple years ago.
[25890.35s -> 25894.35s]  And what happened was I got, I was like, ah, how am I going to track down any of this shit?
[25894.35s -> 25898.35s]  I tried to emulate it. And there was a ton of weird bugs and
[25898.35s -> 25902.35s]  problems and glitches. And I couldn't get it to work properly no matter what tutorials I tried.
[25902.35s -> 25906.59s]  So from that day forward I decided I was going to, I'm going
[25906.59s -> 25910.59s]  just legit only, I'm going to buy the hardware and just play it the way it was meant to be played
[25910.59s -> 25914.96s]  on an Nvidia graphics card. But not really.
[25914.96s -> 25929.92s]  The way it was meant to be played. Sponsored. Oh, internet.
[25929.92s -> 25936.14s]  I just saw a flash of bad internet. But didn't you try to get
[25936.14s -> 25942.30s]  the ISO for that Dreamcast game a week ago? Yeah, but that's, but
[25942.30s -> 25947.05s]  that was desperate because I bought the game. I purchased
[25947.05s -> 25951.05s]  that game and it came to me, delivered to me
[25951.05s -> 25956.25s]  the game that I bought. And it wasn't in the case.
[25956.25s -> 25960.25s]  It was half of the game. So I figured that's, that's
[25960.25s -> 25964.25s]  not, I'm okay. I own that game. I currently
[25964.25s -> 25970.97s]  have it sitting right here. I bought it. That's different. You know, you
[25970.97s -> 25977.26s]  can't sure me on that one. I purchased the game and the game
[25977.26s -> 25981.88s]  was not there. I got the second disc of two discs
[25981.88s -> 25986.06s]  for a game that I purchased and I can't just go to like Walmart or like
[25986.06s -> 25990.06s]  GameStop and buy a new one. The game doesn't even fucking exist anymore.
[25990.06s -> 25995.45s]  They're selling it like third party, fourth party.
[25995.45s -> 25999.88s]  So of course I'm going to look into some alternative actions and ways to make it work.
[25999.88s -> 26006.54s]  You guys act like that was like fucking, that was
[26006.54s -> 26011.10s]  like Battlefield 4. I can still, I can go buy that right now
[26011.10s -> 26023.72s]  and get it. They probably still sell that game at Walmart. Yeah, fourth party.
[26023.72s -> 26034.54s]  But here's the thing. Once you get the hardware, once you
[26034.54s -> 26038.54s]  slowly build up, like I've got PlayStation 1, I got the Dreamcast, I got PlayStation 2,
[26038.54s -> 26042.54s]  I got, well I had a Sega CD and then I gave it to
[26042.54s -> 26046.54s]  a friend of mine. But the point is then you have it all and you own it all.
[26046.54s -> 26050.54s]  And if you ever want to play like an N64 game, bingo, just go
[26050.54s -> 26055.10s]  get it and you just stick it in there and cap it and you can play it like
[26055.10s -> 26059.10s]  one to one real time the way it was meant to be played on the cartridge.
[26059.10s -> 26064.67s]  It's getting late to get this upset. I'm not upset. I'm just speaking matter of factly.
[26064.67s -> 26071.90s]  And then it breaks. And then you go get the emulator.
[26071.90s -> 26079.21s]  And you pretend that you're not on the emulator. Thank you though, Vroom. Appreciate it.
[26079.21s -> 26083.21s]  Sly 161, thanks for the $1. Hey, Jerma, it's midnight on the East Coast and that means it's officially
[26083.21s -> 26087.52s]  my birthday. Did you get me anything cool? I got you a
[26087.52s -> 26092.14s]  finger snap. No, happy birthday, Sly.
[26092.14s -> 26098.99s]  I don't know exactly how old you are, but happy birthday. Happy birthday.
[26098.99s -> 26107.44s]  Oh, cartridges die constantly. Well then I would back it up.
[26107.44s -> 26111.44s]  I would make the ROM myself. That's not against the law. I would put the ROM device in.
[26111.44s -> 26115.44s]  I would pull it from the source and I'd make my own ROM from my own cartridge.
[26115.44s -> 26127.80s]  That's what I would do. That's what I would be doing. But thank you, Sly. Happy birthday.
[26127.80s -> 26132.28s]  DorkCube, thanks for the $1. Hey, Jerma, I hope you and Kim
[26132.28s -> 26136.28s]  and Italics had a happy Valentine's Day. Well, I didn't have
[26136.28s -> 26140.28s]  a Valentine this year. I did find out that my brother is going to propose to his girlfriend tomorrow.
[26140.28s -> 26145.74s]  So I'm pretty excited. That's exciting stuff. I wish
[26145.74s -> 26151.32s]  your brother the best of luck and many years of happiness for you
[26151.32s -> 26158.25s]  and your brother. But yeah, me and Kim had a good...
[26158.25s -> 26162.25s]  We did a Valentine's Day before Valentine's Day
[26162.25s -> 26166.43s]  because it was also our anniversary on the 13th. So we did like a dual
[26166.43s -> 26170.43s]  let's go out and go to dinner and do like a Valentine's Day
[26170.43s -> 26174.43s]  before Valentine's. It's like Christmas with your birthday at the same time. You know, if you have your birthday the day before
[26174.43s -> 26179.48s]  Christmas, you know, you celebrate your birthday
[26179.48s -> 26184.46s]  and Christmas on the same day. It's a dual day. That's right.
[26184.46s -> 26190.73s]  What a ripoff. What? Ripoff. But thank you, DorkCube.
[26190.73s -> 26196.57s]  I wish luck to your brother and his girlfriend.
[26196.57s -> 26201.96s]  DemonicCucumber, thanks for the $1. This guy is asking the real questions. Who?
[26201.96s -> 26206.20s]  It's an immigrant link. Let's see. I'm trying to actually
[26206.20s -> 26210.20s]  gain some muscles on my bony arms, but I don't know where to start. Any recommendations for how I can get
[26210.20s -> 26214.20s]  started and be like 2012 Jerma? Yes.
[26214.20s -> 26220.16s]  Eat. You just, you gotta eat and eat and eat.
[26220.16s -> 26225.55s]  It's coming from a skinny, skinny, skinny guy.
[26225.55s -> 26231.07s]  You need to eat a shitload. And that does not mean McDonald's.
[26231.07s -> 26237.53s]  Okay? I'm not talking about, yeah, just go get like a large
[26237.53s -> 26241.53s]  pizza from Domino's and eat that and then go, no, no, no. You need high
[26241.53s -> 26247.12s]  quality, quality protein. You need to make sure that you're taking
[26247.12s -> 26251.12s]  a good amount, a good high quality protein a little bit before
[26251.12s -> 26257.60s]  and especially after you work out. Within like an hour,
[26257.60s -> 26261.60s]  within 30 minutes to an hour of you lifting weights, you've got to take in a high quality protein.
[26261.60s -> 26269.08s]  Your muscles need to recover, god damn it. You need to be eating a lot of calories,
[26269.08s -> 26273.08s]  but you don't want to eat bad garbage food. You want to eat high quality,
[26273.08s -> 26277.08s]  high calorie foods. This is kind of disgusting.
[26277.08s -> 26281.08s]  I'll tell you guys a little tidbit. Something that I used to do, but I do not, this is not advice.
[26281.08s -> 26286.41s]  I'm not giving advice to anybody. I don't want anyone to take this and be like, oh,
[26286.41s -> 26290.59s]  that's what I should do. Back when I was trying to really gain
[26290.59s -> 26296.49s]  mass, I would, does anybody know what tahini
[26296.49s -> 26307.80s]  is? Tahini. Tahini
[26307.80s -> 26312.56s]  is how they, it's what's in hummus. So hummus
[26312.56s -> 26316.56s]  is usually chickpeas, tahini,
[26316.56s -> 26320.56s]  and garlic and maybe a little bit of lime. It is
[26320.56s -> 26326.12s]  ground up sesame seeds and it is the highest
[26326.12s -> 26330.12s]  caloric food you can possibly eat pound for pound.
[26330.12s -> 26334.12s]  It is one of the highest calorie foods you could possibly eat
[26334.12s -> 26338.68s]  and I used to eat it like peanut butter. Speaking of peanut butter,
[26338.68s -> 26342.99s]  let's move on from that. Don't do what I do,
[26342.99s -> 26346.99s]  but tahini is really, really good. You put it on a salad,
[26346.99s -> 26350.99s]  you put it in, just use it where you should be using it. Don't eat spoonfuls of it like a psycho
[26350.99s -> 26354.99s]  because, I mean, it's like 300 calories a spoonful. Don't do that.
[26354.99s -> 26362.60s]  But peanut butter, that's your best friend. If you like peanut butter,
[26362.60s -> 26366.60s]  you can eat a lot of it and not really feel that guilty, but it's
[26366.60s -> 26372.57s]  high in fat. Just be careful. Don't go crazy because you don't want to cause
[26372.57s -> 26376.57s]  a stomach problem or a digestive issue for yourself if you're just like, oh, I gotta eat a jar of
[26376.57s -> 26383.05s]  peanut butter every day. High quality proteins, especially after you fucking work out.
[26383.05s -> 26392.28s]  But I used to just do a spoonful of tahini before bed.
[26392.28s -> 26397.36s]  It's not bad for you, it's a sesame seed paste, sesame seed spread, it's good.
[26397.36s -> 26404.33s]  Put it on a piece of toast. Somebody's mentioning fish, yes.
[26404.33s -> 26408.70s]  We're talking, I used to eat, but I don't, this is like bad advice though.
[26408.70s -> 26414.52s]  I used to eat tuna out of a can like a cat. I would eat like a can
[26414.52s -> 26419.66s]  of tuna. I would eat like the cheap,
[26419.66s -> 26423.66s]  cheapest tuna I could get out of a can. It was like
[26423.66s -> 26431.93s]  78 cents a can. Tuna's amazing, I love tuna fish, but I
[26431.93s -> 26438.41s]  ate it a lot, too much. I hate like the tuna fish.
[26438.41s -> 26448.59s]  But I did gain weight. Salmon,
[26448.59s -> 26453.28s]  there's also like the rock. Okay, listen to the rock, but don't listen to the rock
[26453.28s -> 26457.77s]  because the rock ate like 12 pounds of cod a day or something,
[26457.77s -> 26463.23s]  right? Fish is the best possible food you can eat if you really want to like body build
[26463.23s -> 26469.58s]  it, so it's just like good, high quality protein and high quality fats.
[26469.58s -> 26473.58s]  Don't think that just eating more is better. Like I said, going to get like a Big Mac every day is going to cause
[26473.58s -> 26481.15s]  you way more problems. The rock eats a three layer cake for breakfast
[26481.15s -> 26491.28s]  every day. But yeah, I loved when I was working out, I loved cod,
[26491.28s -> 26495.84s]  I loved tuna, I loved salmon. Chicken, just like
[26495.84s -> 26499.84s]  chicken breast is really easy to eat and really easy to make.
[26499.84s -> 26503.84s]  You can make a ton of it and just have like, you know, but don't eat like
[26503.84s -> 26508.84s]  fucking meats. Get like some good nice lean chicken breast.
[26508.84s -> 26512.84s]  Cook it up. Get some carrots in there. You want to eat a good amount of carrots
[26512.84s -> 26516.84s]  and like greens. You want a balanced, good diet. You want to be lifting
[26516.84s -> 26520.84s]  and you want to fucking bring those high quality proteins into your life. After you work out especially.
[26520.84s -> 26527.96s]  Don't rely, don't rely on the shit in the box
[26527.96s -> 26533.53s]  that says like, oh yeah, this is all these things in this box. Drink it.
[26533.53s -> 26538.60s]  Got to eat food. You can supplement with those like fucking drinks.
[26538.60s -> 26544.25s]  You can supplement with the drinks, but don't make those drinks
[26544.25s -> 26555.53s]  the main course for your routine. Eat carrots
[26555.53s -> 26565.53s]  before and after you work out. No, you don't have to do that. But yeah, I have not
[26565.53s -> 26570.52s]  been to the gym in a long time. I just got,
[26570.52s -> 26575.72s]  I wish I could still do it. It started getting harder to do post
[26575.72s -> 26581.50s]  30. It really did. 33, 34, it's
[26581.50s -> 26591.48s]  got hard to do. I really am deteriorating, huh?
[26591.48s -> 26597.71s]  Okay, if I was streaming, if I, okay, rewind
[26597.71s -> 26602.01s]  the clock, but also fast forward the clock, okay? If I
[26602.01s -> 26606.25s]  was where, if I'm right now in the twitch.tv seat
[26606.25s -> 26610.25s]  here, German 985 right now, and it's me
[26610.25s -> 26614.25s]  from 2012 sitting here, and I would have the webcam on, you guys
[26614.25s -> 26620.54s]  would see just how fucking jacked and handsome I was. People would be
[26620.54s -> 26628.04s]  commenting on it all the day. I would look over and like, I would
[26628.04s -> 26632.04s]  see my huge fucking arm in the rear view mirror,
[26632.04s -> 26636.22s]  and I would look over at chat and be like, fuck man, he's huge.
[26636.22s -> 26640.65s]  How did he get, he's fucking so jacked, and I'd be like, yeah, fuck, I am, yeah, yeah.
[26640.65s -> 26647.45s]  I wouldn't say that, but I'd be like, yeah, yeah, not anymore. Well, I look like I made
[26647.45s -> 26657.39s]  it a clay. It's amazing, it's really, here's the thing, it's amazing that
[26657.39s -> 26664.09s]  you never like see yourself age, but
[26664.09s -> 26668.72s]  there are certain specific things that I know and do that, because you
[26668.72s -> 26672.72s]  talk, I mean, talking about 2011 is when I started on YouTube, 2012.
[26672.72s -> 26676.72s]  Really, I like got going really in 2012. I made
[26676.72s -> 26681.47s]  a bunch of videos in 2011, but it's weird to see that over almost
[26681.47s -> 26685.47s]  seven to eight years, going from like 25 to
[26685.47s -> 26689.84s]  like 32, 26 to like 33,
[26689.84s -> 26699.63s]  it's a long time, you don't really even think about it. You look at, I look at
[26699.63s -> 26703.93s]  old videos, old photos from like 2010, 2011,
[26703.93s -> 26709.39s]  I'm just like, holy shit, I am like, I'm starting to look like my
[26709.39s -> 26715.10s]  father. When I look at photos of me now instead of almost 10 years ago,
[26715.10s -> 26729.04s]  I look like my father, I can see it, it's weird. Dad
[26729.04s -> 26735.20s]  streamer, I know, it's weird, but I'm not sure how we got on that, but it was
[26735.20s -> 26742.25s]  an interesting talk nonetheless. Thank you though, DemonicCucumber, for your
[26742.25s -> 26747.00s]  two dollars here. Hey Jerma, while I was watching your iSpy stream, I showed
[26747.00s -> 26751.00s]  my mum, yes the one who said you were attractive, some of my
[26751.00s -> 26755.00s]  renders, and we kept having to switch back because of your crazed rant
[26755.00s -> 26759.00s]  about the hot dog eating bear. She thought it was very funny, so
[26759.00s -> 26763.00s]  thanks on her behalf and mine for the laugh.
[26763.00s -> 26767.00s]  That's a great transition into the conversation we were just
[26767.00s -> 26771.18s]  having.
[26771.18s -> 26777.28s]  I love it. Thank you DemonicCucumber, and thank you mum.
[26777.28s -> 26783.63s]  Flugboy, thanks for the one dollar, I threw something together very quickly.
[26783.63s -> 26793.68s]  Let's see what they threw together. Is this a JoJo thing?
[26793.68s -> 26808.76s]  It's up perfectly. Why the fuck aren't the hippos yawning?
[26808.76s -> 26812.76s]  Here, take a look, there it is. It's apparently me stomping on a
[26812.76s -> 26819.63s]  what am I stepping on? And that's not even me, but
[26819.63s -> 26826.62s]  do I just automatically assume every anime I ever get shown is a JoJo's
[26826.62s -> 26832.33s]  Bizarre Adventure reference? Have we gotten there?
[26832.33s -> 26839.12s]  But thank you Flugboy. Thank you Captain Morgan for the one dollar they should
[26839.12s -> 26843.12s]  have got you to play younger Willem Dafoe in Aquaman. Why aren't you
[26843.12s -> 26851.31s]  out there acting?
[26851.31s -> 26856.49s]  I don't know. I'm doing this. I don't need to like,
[26856.49s -> 26865.60s]  go be an actor somewhere. This is an act.
[26865.60s -> 26869.60s]  No, I'm saying like, I don't gotta go like, move to Hollywood and like
[26869.60s -> 26875.24s]  start my acting career. I got this whole damn community, why would I
[26875.24s -> 26882.75s]  do that? Jerma can't act, yes I can, I can act
[26882.75s -> 26890.06s]  circles around anybody you could possibly put me in front of. I'm talking, anybody.
[26890.06s -> 26894.06s]  Especially, you talk about like Twitch, YouTube, but you find me somebody on like Twitch
[26894.06s -> 26899.77s]  YouTube that's a better actor than I am. I'll act anyone. And if you want to
[26899.77s -> 26904.08s]  make it a competition, let's do it. Find me somebody that like wants to be an actor, like
[26904.08s -> 26908.62s]  we'll have an acting composition in Las Vegas, in studio,
[26908.62s -> 26915.08s]  scripts, scenes, and I will destroy them all.
[26915.08s -> 26920.09s]  It won't even be a competition. You guys, I'm gonna upload the fuck away.
[26920.09s -> 26932.52s]  Give me something like, you gotta give me something like real, real fucking heavy too.
[26932.52s -> 26938.24s]  I'll be like a method actor, I'll fucking like smash something and fucking get like
[26938.24s -> 26944.20s]  lightning bolt, you'll hear me say all kinds of fucking swears. He's on his high
[26944.20s -> 26951.37s]  horse now. No, I can, I can out act anybody. I'm certain of it.
[26951.37s -> 26961.10s]  More like a meth actor, what the fuck. I'll show up
[26961.10s -> 26967.82s]  in like a big scarf and huge sunglasses
[26967.82s -> 26972.12s]  drinking like a really tiny coffee. I will destroy them.
[26972.12s -> 26989.79s]  Maybe one day. But thank you to Demonic Cucumber again
[26989.79s -> 26993.79s]  for the one dollar. It's weird to hear that the bit's minimum is going up.
[26993.79s -> 26997.79s]  I'll be okay. I usually donate about five dollars when I can.
[26997.79s -> 27001.79s]  I suppose I'll have to make my messages more compact. I do worry about the others
[27001.79s -> 27005.79s]  in the EU and those viewers everywhere else because bits are quite a bit more expensive
[27005.79s -> 27009.79s]  in some parts of the world. But I'm sure we'd be happier to put less strain on you
[27009.79s -> 27013.79s]  at the end of streams. Anyway, Jerma Heart as usual, mind how you go,
[27013.79s -> 27019.44s]  handsome boy. Yeah, I mean, it was not something that I just did
[27019.44s -> 27025.08s]  for either no reason or because I take it lightly.
[27025.08s -> 27030.16s]  I don't want to increase minimums to read, but sometimes
[27030.16s -> 27035.55s]  we have to make the stream,
[27035.55s -> 27041.64s]  the stream still has to be efficient. And as much as I would love to
[27041.64s -> 27045.82s]  be able to hang out all night and read bits, as the channel
[27045.82s -> 27049.82s]  grows, we have to keep the stream an efficient stream. We have to keep the stream
[27049.82s -> 27053.82s]  rolling and it gets late.
[27053.82s -> 27060.22s]  The stream ended at
[27060.22s -> 27067.28s]  about seven hours. So that was when the game was over.
[27067.28s -> 27071.28s]  The broadcast was pretty much just like, all right, the game's done. The thing that I
[27071.28s -> 27075.28s]  want to do tonight is done and we're going to hang out for a little bit afterwards.
[27075.28s -> 27079.28s]  But when it gets to a point where you've got like seven, eight, nine, ten hours,
[27079.28s -> 27084.40s]  there's two different options. There's either streamline it
[27084.40s -> 27088.64s]  to go really fast and read names and say,
[27088.64s -> 27092.64s]  oh, thank you, demonic key come for the one dollar. Thank you, unconquerable for the one dollar.
[27092.64s -> 27096.64s]  Thank you, mostly lost for the one dollar. Gambling addiction hotline.
[27096.64s -> 27100.64s]  That's funny. Thank you, unconquerable for a dollar. Thank you, Alex for the ten bucks. You deserve
[27100.64s -> 27105.07s]  something for that. I could blow through them. But that's not what the end of my
[27105.07s -> 27111.10s]  streams, that's not what I want to do. So streamlining the end
[27111.10s -> 27115.10s]  process and not bogging it down is
[27115.10s -> 27126.96s]  the goal. The German doesn't know the entire community is five guys making
[27126.96s -> 27133.68s]  fake accounts. As your audience grows, that will be harder.
[27133.68s -> 27137.98s]  I mean, look, we have to face a, you know,
[27137.98s -> 27142.35s]  a potential reality here. And that is, I'm not saying this is going
[27142.35s -> 27146.35s]  to happen, but if it does, you look at some streams that have
[27146.35s -> 27150.35s]  three, four, five thousand concurrent viewers, ten thousand concurrent viewers.
[27150.35s -> 27154.35s]  Sometimes some of these streams have six, seven, eight, nine, ten thousand
[27154.35s -> 27158.35s]  concurrent viewers. It's almost impossible to keep up.
[27158.35s -> 27163.34s]  Like actually impossible to keep up. So
[27163.34s -> 27167.34s]  the reality is if the channel keeps growing and if the community keeps
[27167.34s -> 27171.34s]  growing, these things are going to have to keep happening.
[27171.34s -> 27175.77s]  Not to an extent of, I mean, I would never make a bit reading minimum, but maybe
[27175.77s -> 27179.77s]  the bit reading minimum changes or doesn't happen anymore. Maybe, I don't know.
[27179.77s -> 27183.77s]  I can't tell you that it's, I have no idea what's going to happen. All I can
[27183.77s -> 27188.27s]  do is day to day, month to month, you know,
[27188.27s -> 27192.27s]  by yearly, maybe like once every year or two,
[27192.27s -> 27196.27s]  try to figure out solutions to keep the stream
[27196.27s -> 27200.27s]  going in an efficient and streamlined and fun way. Because as much as
[27200.27s -> 27204.27s]  people love this end of the stream portion of every single stream
[27204.27s -> 27208.76s]  I do now, there are a lot of people that just leave, right?
[27208.76s -> 27213.20s]  There are people that are just like, alright, he's got to the end of the stream, I'm out of here. And
[27213.20s -> 27217.63s]  you know, people will pop back in and be like, oh wait, you're still streaming? It's been like
[27217.63s -> 27228.33s]  three hours, you're still doing the end of the stream? Somebody's gave fifty dollars. Am Scoots,
[27228.33s -> 27235.84s]  thanks for fifty bucks. And they say, greedy streamer. But they think at the end,
[27235.84s -> 27240.78s]  thank you for the fucking fifty dollars. At the end of the day,
[27240.78s -> 27245.34s]  I also have to take into consideration, you know, me.
[27245.34s -> 27251.55s]  Right? Like I'm still, I'm the
[27251.55s -> 27255.55s]  one that's sitting in the chair and talking and I have to try to make it easy
[27255.55s -> 27261.71s]  for me to do as well. And if the end of the streams,
[27261.71s -> 27265.71s]  if like the second stream ends up being like a two, three,
[27265.71s -> 27270.72s]  four hour experience after the stream is over, you know, it can be hard
[27270.72s -> 27275.53s]  to do that. You know, every stream can't be
[27275.53s -> 27279.77s]  seven hours, eight hours of a stream, and then three,
[27279.77s -> 27287.15s]  four hours for reading bits. And a lot of what
[27287.15s -> 27291.15s]  somebody just mentioned, VR Josh just mentioned, would you ever consider having text to speech
[27291.15s -> 27295.15s]  donations? Absolutely not. Never. It'll never happen on this channel. It will never happen.
[27295.15s -> 27303.53s]  I cannot ever do it. Because
[27303.53s -> 27308.16s]  I have the opinion that text to speech audio
[27308.16s -> 27312.78s]  is, it kind of just gets in the way of the stream, like of the broadcast.
[27312.78s -> 27318.11s]  That's just my opinion on it. That's just how I feel about it. I'm not saying
[27318.11s -> 27322.28s]  that it's a wrong way to do your stream. It's just, I have,
[27322.28s -> 27326.28s]  I can't pay attention to that. I can't be trying to do something over here and
[27326.28s -> 27330.28s]  oh, let me take a picture of like the rhino. And then all of a sudden, bang! And somebody's like talking
[27330.28s -> 27336.25s]  in my ear. I do much better when I have very little distractions
[27336.25s -> 27344.70s]  because I'm so easily distracted anyways. And text to speech,
[27344.70s -> 27348.70s]  what text to speech can sometimes do is turn
[27348.70s -> 27352.70s]  a stream into a
[27352.70s -> 27357.64s]  just, everybody's just fucking writing random shit
[27357.64s -> 27362.14s]  that's just gonna be blasted out to a ton of people. So it's less about
[27362.14s -> 27366.14s]  hey, this person is streaming this game, or this person is streaming this event or something, and more
[27366.14s -> 27370.14s]  just full blasting voice talking
[27370.14s -> 27385.96s]  out loud to a bunch of people. But people run their communities the way that they want to
[27385.96s -> 27389.96s]  and that's fine. And I do see like the fun
[27389.96s -> 27394.51s]  in somebody having a system where you can just kind of be
[27394.51s -> 27400.54s]  on stream. Like that's kind of fucking fun. That's kind of cool. Having somebody pop
[27400.54s -> 27405.68s]  up and just be like, their name pops up and this is them talking.
[27405.68s -> 27409.68s]  And they can say, they can just like shitpost, they can say something funny, they can say something interesting.
[27409.68s -> 27420.17s]  I understand that. But I don't think I'd ever want that on my stream.
[27420.17s -> 27424.17s]  So I have to figure out other ways to
[27424.17s -> 27429.37s]  interact with the community. And I think, I thought this was a decent idea
[27429.37s -> 27433.37s]  kind of just doing reading and hanging out at the end of a stream when
[27433.37s -> 27437.37s]  I'm not gonna get distracted by messages or
[27437.37s -> 27444.30s]  sounds or noises or, and I felt like this solution
[27444.30s -> 27448.30s]  was the best one. But this solution is so strange, I think, that it
[27448.30s -> 27454.46s]  needs constant care to still work.
[27454.46s -> 27458.46s]  So that's why things like minimums have to increase. That's why eventually
[27458.46s -> 27463.02s]  maybe some other things might have to change about it as well. But I'm not gonna cross any of those
[27463.02s -> 27468.09s]  bridges until it's certain of what those things have to be. So at the end
[27468.09s -> 27472.09s]  of the day, as of this weekend here, we are going up to $2.50.
[27472.09s -> 27478.11s]  $2.50 to help streamline the end of the stream.
[27478.11s -> 27493.85s]  And it was three. It was three. So I did
[27493.85s -> 27498.09s]  bring it down back from three because of the way the bits are purchased.
[27498.09s -> 27504.68s]  We'll keep going. We'll see. But thank you, Demonic Cucumber.
[27504.68s -> 27509.24s]  Thank you, Unconquerabee for the $1. Shut up and play.
[27509.24s -> 27513.68s]  I'm not sure what I was doing, but hopefully I shut up and played.
[27513.68s -> 27522.51s]  Or maybe I didn't. Maybe I decided I wanted to do something else.
[27522.51s -> 27526.51s]  Maybe if I didn't want to play and I wanted to just say something, maybe that's what I'm gonna do.
[27526.51s -> 27535.15s]  Maybe that's gonna happen. But thank you. Thank you, Mostly Lost for the $1.
[27535.15s -> 27540.35s]  The National Gambling Addiction Hotline. Oh, there it is again. Keep that in mind whenever you go
[27540.35s -> 27544.35s]  triple or nothing on a bet and lose within 30 seconds. I went triple or nothing and I won.
[27544.35s -> 27552.17s]  Thank you, Unconquerabee for the $1. Again, I enjoyed watching this edition of
[27552.17s -> 27556.17s]  German 985, The Legend of the Triple Dog Beer. Anyway, it's been a while and I haven't donated
[27556.17s -> 27560.17s]  in a bit. Glad I got to catch a bit of this stream before I slept.
[27560.17s -> 27564.17s]  Can't wait for the next stream and I hope you keep your gambling tendencies to a minimum.
[27564.17s -> 27569.68s]  Much love, German Heart. Thank you. No, it was a lot of fun. I liked this game
[27569.68s -> 27574.24s]  and I liked this stream and I liked this. It was fun. We had a good time.
[27574.24s -> 27578.24s]  Alex Onyx, thanks for the $10. You deserve something for that.
[27578.24s -> 27583.69s]  $10 apparently from Alex. Thank you.
[27583.69s -> 27590.54s]  Unhealthy Habits. You guys act like...
[27590.54s -> 27597.71s]  Like, I gotta make gambling references.
[27597.71s -> 27601.88s]  I live in Las Vegas, right? That's an easy joke.
[27601.88s -> 27606.32s]  I got so many easy gambling and casino references to make because I live here.
[27606.32s -> 27610.49s]  That's like 75% of the reason why I moved here. So I can make
[27610.49s -> 27620.94s]  casino reference jokes because it's easy comedy. And if you believe that,
[27620.94s -> 27628.56s]  the fuck. But thank you, Alex. Thank you, Most of the Lost for the $1. You know the game has a
[27628.56s -> 27632.56s]  lot of its... You know the game has lost its comedic value when the funniest thing you
[27632.56s -> 27639.34s]  can do is be silent for 15 minutes. And that was fun.
[27639.34s -> 27643.34s]  It was fun. Hey, German 985! Thanks for the 50 community subs, German
[27643.34s -> 27648.28s]  985. And then HaHaHaKuma
[27648.28s -> 27652.91s]  gave 50 as well, making the 100 community subs
[27652.91s -> 27656.91s]  original bet be paid off completely. The debt has been cleared.
[27656.91s -> 27661.79s]  Thank you so much. Thank you, Jerma. Thank you so
[27661.79s -> 27667.18s]  much, man. Holy fuck. How much fucking money is that? How much money is that? How much fucking money
[27667.18s -> 27673.15s]  is that shit? But thank you, HaHaHa. That was... You didn't... You didn't have to
[27673.15s -> 27677.39s]  do that. And you did, so thank you. PizzaBot. Thanks for the $5, PizzaBot.
[27677.39s -> 27681.39s]  I'm pretty sure you almost hit enlightenment with being quiet for so
[27681.39s -> 27688.64s]  long. Something or other thanks to the $1 didn't make a business logo,
[27688.64s -> 27694.28s]  went with a shitty postcard instead. Yeah, that
[27694.28s -> 27698.28s]  works too. That works too. Greetings from Toronto.
[27698.28s -> 27706.92s]  Welcome to Brazil. What? It does make a pretty good postcard.
[27706.92s -> 27715.50s]  Thank you Clueless Sniper for the $1. Mostly lost. Thanks for the $1.
[27715.50s -> 27719.50s]  Also, please don't feel bad about missing my bits. It's really not a big deal.
[27719.50s -> 27724.96s]  Yeah, but it was a lot of money. And I don't ever want to bypass
[27724.96s -> 27728.96s]  somebody's major massive monetary contribution
[27728.96s -> 27733.84s]  to the stream. You know, it's... I want to make sure that you
[27733.84s -> 27740.36s]  know that I see it. Because it's a lot of money. But thank you.
[27740.36s -> 27744.36s]  Thank you Flammable Cow for the $10. May I suggest you play Spongebob Squarepants
[27744.36s -> 27748.36s]  Battle for Bikini Bottom. I was hovering over the purchase button, but I didn't
[27748.36s -> 27753.76s]  buy it. Love the streams. You're a great guy. Keep doing you.
[27753.76s -> 27759.53s]  I was going to buy Spongebob Square, but I didn't know what to do. There's like
[27759.53s -> 27763.53s]  six PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Nickelodeon, Spongebob
[27763.53s -> 27767.53s]  included games. And I didn't know which one was the one to buy. Is it Battle for Bikini Bottom?
[27767.53s -> 27772.41s]  Is that the one? Is that the one that I'm going to beat on stream?
[27772.41s -> 27776.41s]  Is that the Simpsons Hit and Run 2 where I play that game for like a 12 hour session and beat the whole game?
[27776.41s -> 27783.34s]  Is that an angry game? Am I mad at that game?
[27783.34s -> 27792.64s]  No? Is it just fun? Is that a game where you have to be
[27792.64s -> 27800.27s]  picture perfect? Yeah, Nicktoons Unite is one that I saw.
[27800.27s -> 27806.86s]  I was going to get it. Did you actually beat Hit and Run? Oh yeah.
[27806.86s -> 27811.23s]  I did it in one stream. I sat there for like 13 hours and did the whole thing.
[27811.23s -> 27816.88s]  I probably lost a handful of brain cells doing it, but
[27816.88s -> 27824.17s]  I still did it. But yeah, you'll probably see that at some point soon.
[27824.17s -> 27829.88s]  Silver Catalyst. Thanks for the five dollars, Silver Catalyst.
[27829.88s -> 27833.88s]  Hey Jerm, I've been watching you for around five years, but only recently been watching
[27833.88s -> 27837.88s]  your streams, and it's phenomenal how much joy you bring to me. Love your content.
[27837.88s -> 27841.88s]  Also, have you seen this rhythm game called Osu? Someone mapped
[27841.88s -> 27845.88s]  Rats Birthday Mixtape and it's one of the hardest maps ever full combo'd.
[27845.88s -> 27849.88s]  Did somebody link this before?
[27849.88s -> 27855.98s]  Yeah, I remember this. So hold on a second. Do I have the hardest
[27855.98s -> 27869.29s]  level in Osu? Do I have the hardest level in the game? No?
[27869.29s -> 27880.89s]  This is 655pp. What's that mean? Am I in the top 50
[27880.89s -> 27892.99s]  hardest levels in the game? This is a rhythm game, right?
[27892.99s -> 27896.99s]  655 is really high actually, really. That's cool. I think we watched that once before.
[27896.99s -> 27903.96s]  But that's really cool.
[27903.96s -> 27907.96s]  Hardest game for the streamer that plays the hardest games and is really focused
[27907.96s -> 27919.48s]  and gets the job done on stream. That's what I say.
[27919.48s -> 27923.48s]  Is there a Rats Mixtape map in Beat Saber? I think there is. I think somebody showed it to us
[27923.48s -> 27928.94s]  a while ago. PP is the scoring system. It's one of the hardest maps
[27928.94s -> 27937.24s]  DW. Alright, well that's crazy.
[27937.24s -> 27942.32s]  Thank you to the five dollars, Silver Catalyst, and thanks for the video.
[27942.32s -> 27946.75s]  Good luck on all you Osu players. I think you can beat the Rats Mixtape
[27946.75s -> 27952.08s]  level. It's the hardest level in the game. Good luck.
[27952.08s -> 27956.08s]  Uripterida.
[27956.08s -> 27960.08s]  Thanks for the one dollar. College is stressful but your streams always brighten my day.
[27960.08s -> 27964.70s]  Germahart. Gonna be a vet tech when I'm done with this. Awesome.
[27964.70s -> 27968.70s]  Told you guys this before. If I wasn't a streamer or a tuber,
[27968.70s -> 27972.70s]  either one, I would probably go into the veterinary field
[27972.70s -> 27976.70s]  to do with animals. I would own a backyard with a bunch of
[27976.70s -> 27982.22s]  acres of land and I have an elephant. I don't know how to pronounce it either.
[27982.22s -> 27990.80s]  Okay, good. That's good. And then we have two dollars from
[27990.80s -> 27995.10s]  Garfield the Monday Killer. We've got two very large
[27995.10s -> 28001.00s]  Garfagraphs here. Why am I even saying the word
[28001.00s -> 28006.57s]  Garfagraph? It's a paragraph. Don't call it a Garfagraph.
[28006.57s -> 28010.57s]  Hey there Germah, long time no bits. Garf has been out on a Himalayan expedition of magnificent
[28010.57s -> 28014.57s]  magnitude, still murdering Mondays as usual,
[28014.57s -> 28018.57s]  but a whole lot of toony business I had to take care of. Dick Dasterly
[28018.57s -> 28022.75s]  and Muttley even stole all of Garf Bucks and I had to team up with Twitch
[28022.75s -> 28026.75s]  staff in order to put those villains behind bars. How was your Valentine's, Germah? Garf had a surprisingly
[28026.75s -> 28030.75s]  good one despite the Monday-like break up of a few months ago. My two gal
[28030.75s -> 28034.75s]  pals and I made a sorry I ran out of space on the last
[28034.75s -> 28038.75s]  Garfagraph. He he. Anyway, we all, we weren't, we went out and
[28038.75s -> 28042.75s]  did sweet things for one another. We may not be romantically interested, but just hanging out with two good pals
[28042.75s -> 28046.75s]  is just as Garfy. In case you want to know who they are,
[28046.75s -> 28050.75s]  it was Cora from Avatar and Sombra from Overwatch. Okay.
[28050.75s -> 28054.75s]  Yeah, Garf hangs out with Sombra for some reason. That sounds like a funny
[28054.75s -> 28058.75s]  LARPing cartoon joke, but those two actually go to conventions as those
[28058.75s -> 28077.20s]  characters. They're very, they're, thank you Garfield
[28077.20s -> 28083.66s]  for the two dollars. I'm glad you're doing well.
[28083.66s -> 28087.66s]  Tingy, thanks for the one dollar. Cox has delayed this, but here's my hundred dollar message. Thank you, Tingy.
[28087.66s -> 28092.35s]  Yeah, sorry about the stream dying after like an hour and forty minutes a few
[28092.35s -> 28096.84s]  days ago. It was not my intention. I'm sorry that some people got left in
[28096.84s -> 28103.00s]  the dust there, so thank you so much for the huge amount of money. This two dollar and
[28103.00s -> 28107.00s]  fifty cent increase is going to cut into Garfield's savings.
[28107.00s -> 28113.34s]  Gold Ruby production, thanks for the one dollar.
[28113.34s -> 28117.52s]  How is Shito doing? Hope he is well. Shito's doing great.
[28117.52s -> 28121.76s]  He's been asleep for like seven days. That's typically how it works.
[28121.76s -> 28125.76s]  You know how a camel only has to eat or drink like once or like every
[28125.76s -> 28129.76s]  two weeks? Shito is like a camel. Instead of
[28129.76s -> 28133.76s]  eating, he sleeps for like two weeks and then gets up and eats
[28133.76s -> 28139.32s]  some dog food. His favorite. Wakes up
[28139.32s -> 28143.32s]  and plays himself as an instrument. He talks.
[28143.32s -> 28149.02s]  That sounded really bad.
[28149.02s -> 28153.02s]  If a pet is sleeping for seven days, it means it's
[28153.02s -> 28164.16s]  dead.
[28164.16s -> 28170.73s]  That's so terrible. Yeah, he's been sleeping for seven
[28170.73s -> 28174.73s]  days. Thank you, Gold Ruby production. Shito's doing
[28174.73s -> 28179.80s]  just fine. Anything else? Show official. Thanks for the six bucks.
[28179.80s -> 28184.04s]  You ever thought about playing New Vegas with mods? I know you played New Vegas, but the stream was pretty great.
[28184.04s -> 28189.31s]  I thought with mods it would be funnier. Also, you're amazing.
[28189.31s -> 28193.31s]  That's incredibly nice thing to say about somebody. Thank you for that. And to answer the question,
[28193.31s -> 28199.64s]  not now. Not now. Revisiting old stuff
[28199.64s -> 28203.64s]  or games that I played before and adding new content
[28203.64s -> 28208.91s]  is something that we need to go back to eventually.
[28208.91s -> 28214.24s]  Maybe. Because it needs to be like out of my brain completely. I know it's been a few
[28214.24s -> 28221.47s]  years, but it might be worth doing. The thing is though, once you do
[28221.47s -> 28225.47s]  mods, once I do like fucking mods, the game is just
[28225.47s -> 28229.64s]  forever. I can never go back ever again. That happened with the Skyrim.
[28229.64s -> 28233.64s]  Did I do that in Oblivion? I did not do it with Oblivion. I did it with Skyrim,
[28233.64s -> 28238.72s]  and I never went back and played Skyrim the same way ever again. So, putting a bunch of like
[28238.72s -> 28242.96s]  crazy, fun, interesting mods into
[28242.96s -> 28249.87s]  New Vegas. Oh my god.
[28249.87s -> 28254.75s]  Another 50 bucks from Amskoods. 100 dollars total from Amskoods.
[28254.75s -> 28260.08s]  I take it back, you're not a greedy streamer with a smiley face. Hey, thanks.
[28260.08s -> 28270.94s]  Thank you for the 100 bucks. That's a ton of money. But yeah,
[28270.94s -> 28277.21s]  I'm not opposed to the idea. It does sound fun.
[28277.21s -> 28281.21s]  Thank you Dorkcube for the one dollar. How does Garfield always know exactly what to write in order to confuse Jeremy?
[28281.21s -> 28287.87s]  Well, it's not like confusing. It's just like
[28287.87s -> 28292.04s]  two paragraphs of stuff that
[28292.04s -> 28296.48s]  isn't even real. It's just like huge strings
[28296.48s -> 28300.48s]  of shit that's not even real. It's just like talking about John
[28300.48s -> 28310.09s]  and going like grocery store shopping. Hey, speaking of Garfield, the Monday
[28310.09s -> 28314.33s]  killer. Thanks for the one dollar. I actually stopped donating bits to give
[28314.33s -> 28318.33s]  Jerma a break from my Garfer graphs, but that last reading might have been one of
[28318.33s -> 28322.33s]  the hardest he struggled to get through it. Oh my gosh, Jerma, I'm so sorry.
[28322.33s -> 28327.66s]  Please don't hate the Garf. He just wants to make you laugh. Take that back.
[28327.66s -> 28331.66s]  You fuck.
[28331.66s -> 28335.66s]  I gotta give pauses between statements.
[28335.66s -> 28341.05s]  Because I'm gonna copy and paste that.
[28341.05s -> 28346.56s]  Look, look. See, this is me
[28346.56s -> 28356.17s]  quoting Dorkcube. But thank you Garfield. No,
[28356.17s -> 28360.60s]  the stuff you say is fucking funny. It's hard for me to follow. There's so much going on
[28360.60s -> 28371.61s]  in the Garfield lore. But thank you so much, Garfield. What happened to the music?
[28371.61s -> 28378.46s]  I need you to laugh at my joke.
[28378.46s -> 28382.46s]  Poor Garfield. No, everybody loves Garfield. Well, nobody likes
[28382.46s -> 28386.64s]  Garfield. But the fake Garfield that's not the real Garfield
[28386.64s -> 28392.35s]  is in this community and everybody loves the fake Garfield. More like
[28392.35s -> 28398.83s]  dumb985. Why do people get me to try to
[28398.83s -> 28404.09s]  read the same thing? Please laugh at this. Why would I laugh at that?
[28404.09s -> 28414.65s]  What? This is the real Garfield. This is not the real Garfield.
[28414.65s -> 28419.66s]  This is the better Garfield. This is like the original Garfield when
[28419.66s -> 28424.14s]  he used to be fat and funny. Instead of like a plush toy
[28424.14s -> 28431.26s]  that has a cartoon. Garfield the Monday Killer with the dollar.
[28431.26s -> 28435.26s]  What are you talking about, Jerma? I'm the real Garfield. Come on, folks. Give Jerma a round of applause.
[28435.26s -> 28447.36s]  What a funny Garfster. And this is the video.
[28451.36s -> 28458.09s]  That was the Will Smith Genie.
[28458.09s -> 28474.73s]  Oh, man. There it is.
[28474.73s -> 28484.01s]  Alright, I'm going to make a prediction. You ready?
[28484.01s -> 28488.96s]  If I, we're going to price is right this. Or at least like
[28488.96s -> 28492.96s]  over under a little bit here. I'm okay. The Aladdin live action
[28492.96s -> 28498.09s]  movie will have within five percentile
[28498.09s -> 28503.85s]  28% on Rotten Tomatoes. Okay. So that means
[28503.85s -> 28507.85s]  if it's anywhere within 5, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32,
[28507.85s -> 28514.96s]  33, 28, 27, 26, 25, 34, 23.
[28514.96s -> 28523.68s]  28%. If I get it dead on, then I get the jackpot. If
[28523.68s -> 28527.68s]  the live action Aladdin has a higher Rotten Tomatoes than Venom,
[28527.68s -> 28534.20s]  I'll be very surprised. What is Venom at right now? I think it's like
[28534.20s -> 28539.21s]  32, right? 29. Okay, 29% on Rotten Tomatoes
[28539.21s -> 28550.41s]  right now. 28%. See you in like three weeks.
[28550.41s -> 28560.14s]  Wait, when does that movie come out? Like next year? I have no idea.
[28560.14s -> 28566.36s]  But thank you, Garfield. And thank you, that was
[28566.36s -> 28571.42s]  awesome. I believe we're not awesome. Awesome Triss.
[28571.42s -> 28576.49s]  That video. And finally, two more here. Dorkcube, thanks for the one dollar.
[28576.49s -> 28580.49s]  You're making me mad, mister. Stop saying Garfield isn't real. He is real. I know it.
[28580.49s -> 28586.46s]  He eats lasagna, and lasagna is real. Explain that.
[28586.46s -> 28591.15s]  Lasagna is like as if somebody took a fucking textbook,
[28591.15s -> 28595.64s]  wet all the pages, and in between each page put a bunch
[28595.64s -> 28599.64s]  of cheese and sauce, and then put it in the fucking oven.
[28599.64s -> 28614.32s]  When did I tell you it didn't taste good? I didn't tell you it didn't taste good. When did I
[28614.32s -> 28618.49s]  say that? When did I say that lasagna is bad? When did I say that
[28618.49s -> 28622.80s]  lasagna is not tasty? It's just a textbook that has
[28622.80s -> 28636.25s]  been wet and put in the oven and cheese all over it. It's still good?
[28636.25s -> 28640.75s]  Uh oh, he's getting political again. Guys, I love lasagna. I'm fucking kidding.
[28640.75s -> 28649.96s]  I actually haven't eaten lasagna in probably five years.
[28649.96s -> 28654.20s]  That's a real 5% statement. I have
[28654.20s -> 28660.36s]  not eaten lasagna in five years. If I'm going to have lasagna,
[28660.36s -> 28664.73s]  I just want chicken parm instead. No, that's not a lie.
[28664.73s -> 28676.46s]  I have not had lasagna. I have not eaten lasagna maybe even in ten years.
[28676.46s -> 28682.62s]  I don't think I have. I don't think so. Fettuccine Alfredo.
[28682.62s -> 28686.99s]  I want that. Lasagna. Is that on the menu? No.
[28686.99s -> 28692.44s]  What else is on the menu? I'm not going to order lasagna.
[28692.44s -> 28702.56s]  You can't even order lasagna at a restaurant. You have to make lasagna.
[28702.56s -> 28711.85s]  What restaurant has lasagna on the menu? I've never seen
[28711.85s -> 28720.19s]  just default lasagna at an Italian restaurant. The Olive Garden?
[28720.19s -> 28729.48s]  You can't put Olive Garden. Every Italian restaurant
[28729.48s -> 28735.32s]  has lasagna on the menu. They don't? I'm talking about
[28735.32s -> 28742.51s]  nobody has a default lasagna. Risotto.
[28742.51s -> 28746.51s]  Uh, rigatoni.
[28746.51s -> 28752.14s]  Fettuccine Alfredo. Chicken broccoli ziti. Chicken parm.
[28752.14s -> 28761.48s]  Chicken marsala. Shrimp scampi. No, just because it's had
[28761.48s -> 28770.97s]  chilies. Yeah, alright, so there's a lasagna at like
[28770.97s -> 28782.94s]  Friday's. Meatballs, right? Let's look at the TGI
[28782.94s -> 28793.44s]  Friday's menu and see what they got. Okay, we got loaded chicken nachos.
[28793.44s -> 28797.68s]  Cheeseburger sliders. Philly cheesesteak egg rolls.
[28797.68s -> 28801.85s]  What the fuck? Philly cheesesteak egg rolls. Wings roulette
[28801.85s -> 28809.10s]  platter. Chicken quesadilla. No, we've got to go down. Friday's classics.
[28809.10s -> 28816.00s]  Bucket of bones. That's what this is actually called.
[28816.00s -> 28820.54s]  Whiskey sliders. Chicken strips.
[28820.54s -> 28825.61s]  Come on, where is it? There's mozzarella sticks. Wings.
[28825.61s -> 28831.24s]  Burgers. Soups and salads. I'm not making
[28831.24s -> 28835.61s]  that up. It actually says bucket of bones. Sandwiches.
[28835.61s -> 28841.50s]  Pasta. Here we go. Nope. Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta.
[28841.50s -> 28848.04s]  Chicken parmesan pasta. Lemon and garlic shrimp pasta.
[28848.04s -> 28852.86s]  Alright, Olive Garden. Olive Garden. Olive Garden
[28852.86s -> 28861.00s]  menu. Okay, if there is no default
[28861.00s -> 28873.82s]  lasagna on this menu, you guys have to apologize to me. Okay,
[28873.82s -> 28879.79s]  we're looking for the dinner menu at Olive Garden. Okay,
[28879.79s -> 28884.60s]  we've got appetizers. Create your own pasta bowl.
[28884.60s -> 28889.10s]  Classic favorites. Okay, what do we got for a classic favorite?
[28889.10s -> 28894.92s]  It's like, here we go. Bolognese.
[28894.92s -> 28898.92s]  Creamy mushroom. Ravioli. A tour of Italy.
[28898.92s -> 28902.92s]  Cheese ravioli. Shrimp alfredo. Seafood alfredo. Chicken alfredo.
[28902.92s -> 28906.92s]  Chicken parm. Chicken scampi. Five cheese ziti.
[28906.92s -> 28910.92s]  Fettuccine alfredo. Eggplant parm. Lasagna classico.
[28910.92s -> 28920.60s]  I've never seen a lasagna on a menu at an Italian restaurant.
[28920.60s -> 28926.19s]  Olive Garden does not count. No, Olive Garden
[28926.19s -> 28930.94s]  doesn't count. Olive Garden is not an Italian restaurant.
[28930.94s -> 28950.99s]  Olive Garden is like the subway of Italian restaurants. What's wrong with subway?
[28950.99s -> 28958.73s]  They're going under. I got some real, real bad news for all you subway
[28958.73s -> 28962.73s]  fans. I don't see that company still existing in like 20
[28962.73s -> 28981.10s]  years. And they're taking all the lasagna with them. Feels bad, man.
[28981.10s -> 28985.10s]  It's because they don't have lasagna. It's the first time I've ever seen lasagna on a menu.
[28985.10s -> 28997.52s]  I swear to God. I'm okay with that.
[28997.52s -> 29006.86s]  I haven't had it. I haven't eaten
[29006.86s -> 29010.86s]  lasagna in five fucking years. I'm not kidding. I swear.
[29010.86s -> 29021.93s]  Wait, am I hearing right that lasagna is also not Italian?
[29021.93s -> 29041.26s]  Hold on a minute. Where does lasagna come from? Italy.
[29041.26s -> 29045.26s]  Lasagna, in Italy at least, has never been an everyday dish.
[29045.26s -> 29049.63s]  Those delicate sheets of fresh egg pasta, the complex sauces and ingredients
[29049.63s -> 29054.25s]  for the filling, it'd be a momentous occasion
[29054.25s -> 29058.43s]  to be with all that work. That's why in the North, lasagna
[29058.43s -> 29079.36s]  is not even, they don't even eat it there. Lasagna.
[29079.36s -> 29086.41s]  All right. I'm sorry, man. But look, look. I mean, that looks
[29086.41s -> 29109.15s]  like as appetizing as a catcher's mitt.
[29109.15s -> 29113.15s]  Somebody worked hard on that. It's not their fault. Lasagna just looks like
[29113.15s -> 29118.48s]  that. Lasagna just looks like cat puke.
[29118.48s -> 29126.54s]  That's not, look, you can make the best lasagna in the world.
[29126.54s -> 29130.78s]  It tastes good, it's not, but it looks like
[29130.78s -> 29143.82s]  a catcher's mitt. Lasagna.
[29143.82s -> 29152.22s]  Garfield, what have you done? What if your mother made you lasagna? Would you say it looked
[29152.22s -> 29158.64s]  like cat puke? No, I would eat it and I think it was delicious. Guys,
[29158.64s -> 29162.64s]  it's pasta sheets, a bunch of cheese, and a ton of
[29162.64s -> 29169.42s]  sauce. That doesn't taste bad. What's, there's nothing wrong
[29169.42s -> 29177.42s]  with it. It's, that's all it is. It's pizza
[29177.42s -> 29184.22s]  with dough or your bread. At least we don't eat canned tuna. I'm banning
[29184.22s -> 29189.10s]  this guy. How do I do that? I just gifted them a
[29189.10s -> 29209.47s]  sub. Alright, hold on. Yeah, I get fucking banned.
[29209.47s -> 29235.71s]  Yeah, I get banned. Like, that's really close to ban person.
[29235.71s -> 29240.14s]  There's like, add friend, whisper, gift a sub, and then like
[29240.14s -> 29244.14s]  right there is also ban. Like, ban is not even
[29244.14s -> 29261.95s]  two inches away from gift sub. Alright, now I'm actually, now I'm gonna ban you.
[29261.95s -> 29269.37s]  I'm gonna get banned for like a day. Alright, it's time to go. I gotta get
[29269.37s -> 29273.61s]  ahead of here. Lasagna tastes great, it's delicious, it's wonderful.
[29273.61s -> 29279.95s]  It's just, it's not on Italian menu. It's on
[29279.95s -> 29284.44s]  Olive Garden and like Friday's secret menu. You gotta order from the secret
[29284.44s -> 29290.54s]  menu. German, please laugh, please. Just pretend laugh at my joke.
[29290.54s -> 29294.84s]  I need your Boston laughs. What was the joke?
[29294.84s -> 29306.25s]  Wait, what are you spamming this for? You can take the sub back.
[29306.25s -> 29310.25s]  I can't take the sub back. I'm not gonna ban you. I'm just, why
[29310.25s -> 29316.16s]  would I ban you? Did I just give you like a three month sub?
[29316.16s -> 29323.66s]  Wow, okay, I'm loud, alright.
[29323.66s -> 29335.50s]  Just, I did it. Subway isn't going under.
[29335.50s -> 29343.88s]  It's gonna happen. Does that work? German 95 is gifted a, no
[29343.88s -> 29348.83s]  it was tier one. I see it in my streamlabs. More like
[29348.83s -> 29355.50s]  Uglyma985.
[29355.50s -> 29360.76s]  Like that. Hey QWWQ4, thanks for the one dollar.
[29360.76s -> 29365.20s]  They say meatball, what is this? This is not a real website. Hey Dork Cube
[29365.20s -> 29369.20s]  thanks for the one dollar. Get fucked. Lasagna Classico for the goddamn win.
[29369.20s -> 29373.20s]  I didn't, I like lasagna. This is just, this is
[29373.20s -> 29377.20s]  a bullshit article that was written about me in chat how I don't like lasagna.
[29377.20s -> 29381.20s]  I said it was delicious, I said it was full of delicious flavors, and then I love,
[29381.20s -> 29388.51s]  I would eat it. When did I ever say that? Hey Zazzasalt,
[29388.51s -> 29392.51s]  thanks for the one dollar. A while ago you mentioned wanting a short co-op game to play with italics.
[29392.51s -> 29396.51s]  I recommend Monaco. What's yours is mine. It's a co-op heist game
[29396.51s -> 29404.65s]  that I think would be great stream material. I've actually heard of that
[29404.65s -> 29410.68s]  game. We were looking at stuff recently. Some PS3
[29410.68s -> 29414.68s]  stuff maybe we could do together. Cause we have all these old consoles.
[29414.68s -> 29418.68s]  But Dork Cube thanks for the one dollar. You're making me mad mister. Stop saying Garfield isn't real.
[29418.68s -> 29423.31s]  I thought this was a lasagna thing again. Alright, look at the source.
[29423.31s -> 29431.20s]  Zazzasalt says someone's mom made this and now she's crying. But did you
[29431.20s -> 29435.37s]  not hear my statement about how all lasagna
[29435.37s -> 29439.37s]  looks like that? Gordon Ramsey could make a lasagna.
[29439.37s -> 29443.87s]  And it would still look like that. That's just what lasagna is.
[29443.87s -> 29458.54s]  It's just a ton of layered sheets of pasta and
[29458.54s -> 29464.57s]  sauce all over it with a shit load of cheese stuffed in it.
[29464.57s -> 29470.54s]  I'll make it on stream. I can do it.
[29470.54s -> 29474.54s]  Last two here, thank you Juno. Scepto over the three bucks.
[29474.54s -> 29478.54s]  Thanks for the stream. I don't know why I couldn't stop laughing at a man literally not talking or remoting
[29478.54s -> 29483.61s]  over for ten minutes. It was hard. But thank you.
[29483.61s -> 29487.61s]  Glad to have you. QWWQ4 thanks for the one dollar. It's the
[29487.61s -> 29492.30s]  menu for Spaghetti Warehouse. Don't be mean to lasagna.
[29492.30s -> 29501.63s]  Lasagna. But thank you guys. Let's take a look at the
[29501.63s -> 29506.06s]  video. There's going to be a shit load of subs that scroll up here really fast. Cause as you know
[29506.06s -> 29510.68s]  there were a ton of community subs. And here they come.
[29510.68s -> 29516.14s]  Thank you everybody. General please tell me a bedtime story that will help me sleep.
[29516.14s -> 29520.81s]  Once there was a young prince
[29520.81s -> 29526.40s]  that lived in a castle. He was really
[29526.40s -> 29530.70s]  really good at Fortnite. So one day he got the
[29530.70s -> 29539.36s]  Victory Royale in Fortnite. I'm really rusty on these aren't I?
[29539.36s -> 29557.45s]  Mentioning Fortnite. I said Fortnite and it threw me off.
[29557.45s -> 29566.24s]  This is lagging. It's going so fast. That was a shitty story. Tell us a better one.
[29566.24s -> 29572.89s]  It was a shitty story. Blah blah blah blah blah.
[29572.89s -> 29578.09s]  It was a shitty story. Blah blah blah. You want a better one? Fine.
[29578.09s -> 29583.04s]  How about this one? This one's called...
[29583.04s -> 29587.04s]  I'm just going to come up with more than a fly here.
[29587.04s -> 29591.58s]  Okay so you got a... Okay how about...
[29591.58s -> 29596.51s]  I got a decent one. We got a
[29596.51s -> 29600.51s]  small one cause we were just doing stuff about animals. A fawn was
[29600.51s -> 29604.51s]  racing in the forest. He was ahead of a rabbit.
[29604.51s -> 29608.88s]  He was very fast coming through. He was ahead of the elephant.
[29608.88s -> 29612.88s]  The fawn is faster than the elephant. The fawn is faster than the rabbit.
[29612.88s -> 29616.88s]  He leapt and cleared the stream. He ran past
[29616.88s -> 29621.56s]  the crumbling wall of dirt. There was a large boulder on the
[29621.56s -> 29625.56s]  grassy plain. He stumbled and fell down.
[29625.56s -> 29629.56s]  He burst into tears and the monkey massaged his leg.
[29629.56s -> 29633.56s]  Tears flowed from the fawn's eyes.
[29633.56s -> 29637.56s]  The brother bear picked him up. The fawn didn't stop crying. His mother came.
[29637.56s -> 29642.51s]  She said, look we'll beat up this bad boulder. The fawn said, oh don't
[29642.51s -> 29646.51s]  do that. Then the boulder will also start crying. His mother laughed. So did the fawn.
[29646.51s -> 29656.64s]  That's the story. Ten more community subs just came in.
[29656.64s -> 29664.83s]  What's the moral of the story? I don't know. You don't have any fucking idea what the moral of
[29664.83s -> 29672.20s]  this story is. It's a cute story that's told by some kid or something. I don't know.
[29672.20s -> 29678.92s]  Amscoots, ten community subs. Thank you Amscoots.
[29678.92s -> 29687.95s]  Really appreciate it. It's a lot. Was this story generated by an AI?
[29687.95s -> 29693.84s]  I don't think so. And those of you that want to like
[29693.84s -> 29698.72s]  this is a children's book right? Was my book better than this book?
[29698.72s -> 29705.12s]  This book, this is a book. This book was originally published.
[29705.12s -> 29711.32s]  This is a published book. This is exactly what I have to say.
[29711.32s -> 29715.32s]  The person just did the, they did fawn racing
[29715.32s -> 29724.04s]  in forest and then they made this up. They had the random number
[29724.04s -> 29735.50s]  generator. Are you still on the children's book joke? Yeah, then we've been going
[29735.50s -> 29740.64s]  this whole time. I've been streaming for like four days straight.
[29740.64s -> 29748.46s]  I've written like five books. But that's gonna be it. Thank you
[29748.46s -> 29752.46s]  everybody for hanging out. Again, I'm not entirely sure
[29752.46s -> 29756.46s]  what tomorrow is going to hold. So
[29756.46s -> 29760.46s]  tentative that I'll be live tomorrow. But the next time that I am live, whether it's
[29760.46s -> 29764.89s]  tomorrow or a day from now, we will be doing
[29764.89s -> 29768.89s]  live. I'm gonna get into it. I'm gonna get started. I'll see you when I see you.
[29768.89s -> 29772.89s]  The sus is probably gonna be weird or inaccurate for a day or two.
[29772.89s -> 29778.59s]  So I'll be here tomorrow afternoon to let you guys know what's happening.
[29778.59s -> 29782.59s]  So regardless if I stream or not tomorrow, I'll be here at around like
[29782.59s -> 29787.02s]  2, 2.30 tomorrow just to let everybody know what's gonna happen. Or maybe I'll make a
[29787.02s -> 29792.03s]  tweet or something. Just check my socials, you know. Have a great night.
[29792.03s -> 29796.03s]  Thanks for hanging out. This is Blast as always. See you guys soon.
