[1.08s -> 5.08s]  Trees. Found trees. Found them. Right there.
[5.08s -> 9.40s]  We can all calm down now. I found the trees.
[9.40s -> 12.40s]  And I am gonna starve to death. Oh my god.
[12.40s -> 14.70s]  Do I have any- I have, like, food, right?
[14.70s -> 19.04s]  What if I eat the raw beef? Does it give me, like, E. coli?
[19.04s -> 25.54s]  Oh, it doesn't- the rotting flesh is, like, better.
[25.54s -> 29.98s]  No, it's not. Not at all.
[29.98s -> 36.01s]  Alright, tree. There we are.
[36.01s -> 38.69s]  No, I don't have a- nooo!
[38.69s -> 43.88s]  Is this the only tree here?
[43.88s -> 45.08s]  You're killing me!
[45.18s -> 52.23s]  I need at least, like, a stack of wood to create my floor.
[52.23s -> 54.75s]  My wooden paneling floor.
[54.75s -> 58.25s]  Cause I wanna- I wanna look like a rich person.
[58.25s -> 61.50s]  Is that really the only damn tree here?
[61.50s -> 66.40s]  The nec- look, okay, look. The next tree is over there.
[66.40s -> 69.10s]  Oh my god.
[69.10s -> 72.60s]  I would sprint, but I don't wanna lose all my hunger.
[72.60s -> 74.96s]  Cause that would be bad.
[74.96s -> 77.76s]  I'm just gonna eat all this rotten raw beef.
[77.76s -> 81.16s]  Let's see if I get salmonella.
[81.16s -> 84.77s]  Alright, so far so good.
[84.87s -> 86.76s]  Oh yeah.
[86.76s -> 92.16s]  I wanna get up to that stupid tree up there.
[92.16s -> 96.58s]  Alright, you've had your fun. Time for you to die.
[96.58s -> 98.88s]  I'm only level two.
[98.88s -> 100.38s]  Is that because I've died so many times?
[100.38s -> 103.70s]  Alright, I have to make the trek up this mountain.
[103.70s -> 104.80s]  To get this stupid tree.
[104.80s -> 106.50s]  I haven't been leaving the breadcrumb trail.
[106.50s -> 108.10s]  I'm gonna get lost.
[108.10s -> 109.90s]  And I'm never gonna find the house again.
[109.90s -> 111.80s]  I think I'll be alright.
[111.80s -> 114.00s]  I can see there's a torch over there.
[114.00s -> 118.51s]  I have to get up to this one other tree up here.
[118.51s -> 120.58s]  This is ridiculous.
[120.68s -> 125.11s]  One damn tree at the top of a mountain.
[125.11s -> 126.61s]  What?
[126.61s -> 127.71s]  Where the hell did you even come from?
[127.71s -> 131.86s]  I'm knocking you off the cliff like I did your brother.
[131.86s -> 134.26s]  Where is he?
[134.26s -> 136.05s]  Get out of here.
[136.05s -> 139.05s]  Get out of here.
[139.05s -> 139.85s]  Oh, whatever.
[139.85s -> 141.65s]  You can just, I'm just gonna go away.
[141.65s -> 144.56s]  Go away, I'll take it, I'll take it.
[144.56s -> 147.17s]  Nice, level three.
[147.17s -> 149.27s]  Oh, already this is gonna be cruel.
[149.27s -> 150.47s]  This cow.
[150.47s -> 151.97s]  Oh, I can watch the sunset.
[151.97s -> 154.71s]  I'm gonna knock this cow off.
[154.71s -> 157.98s]  Sorry cow, but you had it coming.
[157.98s -> 160.85s]  Plus I want your meat.
[160.85s -> 162.39s]  I want your meat.
[162.49s -> 164.93s]  Look at this.
[164.93s -> 167.38s]  Now see.
[167.38s -> 170.58s]  Now see, this is what it's all about, guys.
[170.58s -> 174.40s]  Watching the sunrise on the top of a mountain.
[174.40s -> 178.91s]  Looking down at all the beautiful stuff.
[178.91s -> 182.66s]  Oh, sorry cow.
[182.66s -> 189.12s]  Oh man.
[189.12s -> 191.92s]  Come on, I can't believe I need to find some more trees.
[191.92s -> 194.91s]  This is bad.
[194.91s -> 197.98s]  How many wooden planks am I gonna get out of this?
[197.98s -> 201.68s]  If I'm gonna get at least a stack of 64 wooden planks,
[201.68s -> 206.42s]  I should be able to cover my whole ground level.
[206.42s -> 208.72s]  And not even close.
[208.72s -> 210.42s]  Kinda close, though.
[210.42s -> 213.49s]  Actually, no, I got some of these, so okay.
[213.49s -> 214.49s]  If I can get one more tree.
[214.49s -> 215.29s]  Where's one more tree?
[215.29s -> 217.09s]  Oh, yeah, right down there.
[217.09s -> 219.45s]  All right, I need to go.
[219.45s -> 221.46s]  Oh no.
[221.46s -> 222.86s]  Wait, hold on.
[222.86s -> 224.36s]  Okay, it's this way.
[224.36s -> 226.53s]  That's the way I gotta go.
[226.53s -> 227.73s]  There's a tree right there, too.
[227.73s -> 229.33s]  I'll take that tree and just go home,
[229.33s -> 230.53s]  because I'm gonna get lost.
[230.53s -> 232.11s]  Oh!
[232.11s -> 233.71s]  That was close.
[233.71s -> 236.78s]  I was actually very terrified about that one.
[236.78s -> 239.57s]  Let's go!
[239.57s -> 244.88s]  Let's get this last tree and then go home
[244.88s -> 247.78s]  so I can build the rest of my floor.
[247.78s -> 251.75s]  God.
[251.75s -> 256.99s]  Ka-chunk, ka-chunk, ka-chunk.
[256.99s -> 261.42s]  Okay, let's see if I can't get some floor out of that.
[261.42s -> 262.42s]  So there's one of my torches.
[262.42s -> 262.82s]  I see it.
[262.82s -> 266.14s]  They see my breadcrumb trail I left.
[266.14s -> 269.37s]  So far, so good.
[269.37s -> 276.23s]  Give me more of these so I can make some pita bread.
[276.23s -> 277.93s]  All right, as I go, I'm gonna take the torches back,
[277.93s -> 280.24s]  because that's a waste.
[280.24s -> 290.15s]  Whoop!
[290.15s -> 294.06s]  Excellent.
[294.16s -> 309.38s]  Excellente.
[309.38s -> 312.89s]  Blink.
[312.89s -> 318.44s]  Boink.
[318.44s -> 320.24s]  Okay, so I'm on my way back,
[320.24s -> 322.74s]  and I went all the way this way,
[322.74s -> 323.74s]  all the way down there,
[323.74s -> 326.24s]  way past that thing up on a mountain,
[326.24s -> 329.07s]  and there was a whole forest right there.
[329.07s -> 330.57s]  So...
[330.57s -> 333.35s]  Yeah.
[333.35s -> 335.44s]  Whoops!
[335.44s -> 341.86s]  I'll come back to that later.
[341.86s -> 343.76s]  We've collected the trees.
[343.76s -> 345.96s]  We've collected the wood.
[345.96s -> 350.56s]  Time to go back home and build up the house like we should.
[350.56s -> 354.06s]  There's no reason to fear, and there's no reason to fret.
[354.06s -> 355.56s]  There's a creeper in my house!
[355.56s -> 357.16s]  Oh, I can't!
[357.16s -> 359.06s]  Oh, God!
[359.06s -> 360.06s]  Get away from me!
[360.06s -> 361.46s]  Don't ruin my house!
[361.46s -> 362.76s]  Don't ruin my house!
[362.76s -> 363.16s]  You...
[363.16s -> 363.86s]  Come here! That's right!
[363.86s -> 364.56s]  Come over here!
[364.56s -> 367.19s]  Come over here!
[367.19s -> 370.56s]  You ruined my song, you piece of shit!
[370.56s -> 373.80s]  How...
[373.80s -> 375.92s]  My boat!
[375.92s -> 381.95s]  Oh...
[381.95s -> 386.64s]  Okay, is there anybody else in the damn house?
[386.64s -> 387.74s]  Okay.
[387.74s -> 389.04s]  I think we're good.
