[0.31s -> 16.54s]  Now what, build the mannequin? Build the mannequin.
[16.54s -> 21.31s]  Alright, well the head, the octopus head definitely goes on the head.
[21.31s -> 24.68s]  That's very painfully obvious. Okay.
[24.68s -> 27.93s]  So what is the banana, is the banana my like dick?
[27.93s -> 30.56s]  What's the banana for?
[30.56s -> 37.30s]  Alright, the suit goes on here. Suit obviously, okay.
[37.30s -> 42.02s]  So what's the banana? Get out of the way, chair.
[42.02s -> 46.60s]  Get out of my, get out of my way, my god.
[46.60s -> 52.94s]  Here, take it. Oh. Okay, I was wrong.
[54.32s -> 57.76s]  I did it, mannequin complete.
[57.76s -> 61.79s]  I am the victor of the game.
[61.79s -> 66.31s]  Well now what, did I beat it? Did I beat octopus father?
[66.31s -> 71.31s]  Oh my god.
[71.31s -> 75.02s]  Why is my house on fire?
[75.02s -> 79.78s]  What is going on? Did this guy burn my house down?
[79.78s -> 82.78s]  Oh my god, what about my family?
[82.78s -> 85.97s]  What about my like kids and my wife?
[85.97s -> 93.56s]  I am not concerned about climbing this ladder as much as my like sleeping daughter that's like burning in a fire right now.
[93.56s -> 97.78s]  Yeah, see, I climbed your stupid ladder.
[97.78s -> 103.06s]  Get over here. I did it.
[103.06s -> 106.06s]  Now can I go save my family? That's in, whoa.
[106.06s -> 108.62s]  Gotta secure a grip on my face.
[108.62s -> 110.62s]  I don't know.
[110.62s -> 113.12s]  I got away, I'm good. I'm good like that.
[113.12s -> 118.42s]  You will be dead from sushi. I said that completely wrong. That was embarrassing.
[118.42s -> 119.92s]  Oh damn.
[119.92s -> 122.10s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[122.10s -> 123.10s]  It's the mannequin.
[123.10s -> 127.13s]  Isn't the house on fire still?
[127.13s -> 133.64s]  I don't understand. What happened to the house burning?
[133.64s -> 141.14s]  The house was legitimately just on fire and it's just not anymore. Okay, whatever.
[141.14s -> 143.92s]  So now what?
[143.92s -> 148.33s]  I don't understand what I'm supposed to do.
[148.33s -> 150.64s]  I don't understand.
[150.64s -> 152.64s]  I don't understand.
[152.64s -> 154.64s]  I don't understand.
[154.64s -> 157.64s]  Just gonna climb up this place.
[157.64s -> 161.58s]  Something tells me this is not supposed to be happening right now.
[161.58s -> 164.82s]  I don't think I'm supposed to be doing this.
[164.82s -> 167.82s]  I'm pretty sure I'm not supposed to be glitched into the wall.
[167.82s -> 170.32s]  And like sliding up.
[170.32s -> 176.16s]  I'm like one of those chairs that climbs down.
[176.16s -> 179.16s]  I can't even make the joke. This is too weird.
[179.16s -> 181.16s]  Get me. What's happening to me?
[181.16s -> 183.85s]  Seriously, what the f...
[183.85s -> 188.23s]  Get up the stairs.
[188.23s -> 190.23s]  I'm gonna have to restart the game.
[190.23s -> 193.68s]  Where's my left leg?
[193.68s -> 197.12s]  Oh, whoa.
[197.12s -> 198.12s]  Oh, hold on.
[198.12s -> 200.12s]  You can see my left leg.
[200.12s -> 202.12s]  I can see my right leg.
[202.12s -> 205.64s]  I can see my right leg.
[205.64s -> 207.64s]  Whoa. Whoa.
[207.64s -> 209.39s]  Oh, hold on.
[209.39s -> 212.56s]  So you can actually slip on the banana peels?
[212.56s -> 216.76s]  Oh, whoops-a-daisy.
[216.76s -> 219.76s]  Oh, let's take a joke from like an 80s cartoon.
[219.76s -> 222.76s]  Whoa, look out. Is that a banana peel right there?
[222.76s -> 224.76s]  Whoa.
[224.76s -> 227.58s]  What the hell do I even do now?
[227.58s -> 228.58s]  Did I beat the game?
[228.58s -> 230.58s]  It didn't say like I beat the game.
[230.58s -> 231.58s]  It was like, oh, hooray.
[231.58s -> 233.88s]  You saved us from burning.
[233.88s -> 235.44s]  Bye.
[235.44s -> 238.00s]  Can I play pool?
[238.00s -> 240.56s]  I thought I think I can actually play pool.
[240.56s -> 241.56s]  Oh, hell yeah.
[241.56s -> 242.93s]  Let's go.
[242.93s -> 243.93s]  Let's play this pool game.
[243.93s -> 249.92s]  Come on, you...
[249.92s -> 250.92s]  No.
[250.92s -> 253.92s]  No, I'm gonna get a scratch.
[253.92s -> 257.22s]  I just scratched.
[257.22s -> 259.22s]  I'm really good at pool.
[259.22s -> 260.22s]  Yeah.
[260.22s -> 261.22s]  Well, I didn't want to do that.
[261.22s -> 262.22s]  I wanted to throw it.
[262.22s -> 263.84s]  That's why I said yeah.
[263.84s -> 265.79s]  Yeah.
[265.79s -> 267.28s]  Are you kidding me right now?
[267.28s -> 269.28s]  I'm knocking these things over.
[269.28s -> 272.85s]  This is how we play pool.
[272.85s -> 276.31s]  As a real man.
[276.31s -> 277.31s]  I'm like stomping grapes.
[277.31s -> 279.31s]  Anyone want some pool wine?
[279.31s -> 280.93s]  Wait a second.
[280.93s -> 283.68s]  Wait just one second.
[283.68s -> 286.84s]  This is a shovel.
[286.84s -> 288.84s]  Why would there just be a shovel right here?
[288.84s -> 291.62s]  Hold on.
[291.62s -> 294.62s]  Am I about to dig up this dead body that's down here?
[294.62s -> 295.62s]  It works.
[295.62s -> 296.62s]  It works.
[296.62s -> 298.88s]  It works.
[298.88s -> 299.88s]  Hold on.
[299.88s -> 300.88s]  Oh, my God.
[300.88s -> 301.88s]  This guy's dead corpse is gonna be down here, I think.
[301.88s -> 302.88s]  The real father.
[302.88s -> 305.25s]  Oh, that would be so crazy.
[305.25s -> 308.67s]  There's bananas.
[308.67s -> 313.19s]  Is this octodad or octodog?
[313.19s -> 316.00s]  Because who buries this many things?
[316.00s -> 317.00s]  Like, what the hell?
[317.00s -> 319.00s]  Half octopus, half dog.
[319.00s -> 321.69s]  Oh, I want to bury my toys.
[321.69s -> 322.69s]  Wait a second.
[322.69s -> 325.15s]  Get that out of here.
[325.15s -> 326.58s]  Get the fuck out of here.
[326.58s -> 327.58s]  That's a key.
[327.58s -> 329.84s]  That's a key.
[329.84s -> 331.72s]  Give me that.
[331.72s -> 332.72s]  What?
[332.72s -> 334.96s]  Is this like a giant like prop key or is that like a real key?
[334.96s -> 335.96s]  Pick it up.
[335.96s -> 339.64s]  What?
[339.64s -> 340.64s]  Pick the fucking key up.
[340.64s -> 341.64s]  Yes.
[341.64s -> 345.26s]  You found a key.
[345.26s -> 348.26s]  The key can be used to open doors of various lengths.
[348.26s -> 351.20s]  Okay, I've got to say this right now.
[351.20s -> 355.20s]  I've been walking around aimlessly with this key in my fucking hand.
[355.20s -> 358.64s]  In my fucking hand for like 30 minutes.
[358.64s -> 361.94s]  And you're telling me I'm looking at a keyhole right over there.
[361.94s -> 363.94s]  You see that?
[363.94s -> 364.94s]  You guys see this right here?
[364.94s -> 368.16s]  This is going to open this door.
[368.16s -> 370.94s]  Please come on.
[370.94s -> 371.94s]  Please tell me I was right.
[371.94s -> 373.94s]  Please tell me I...
[373.94s -> 376.59s]  What is this?
[376.59s -> 377.59s]  What is this?
[377.59s -> 378.59s]  Open.
[378.59s -> 381.34s]  Open with your legs.
[381.34s -> 385.14s]  Does that not do anything?
[385.14s -> 386.14s]  Come on.
[386.14s -> 389.49s]  Open.
[389.49s -> 391.63s]  Open.
[391.63s -> 394.85s]  Yes.
[394.85s -> 396.09s]  What the...
[396.09s -> 398.84s]  Where the hell am I?
[398.84s -> 403.39s]  I'm in like an underground facility.
[403.39s -> 405.40s]  What is this?
[405.40s -> 408.40s]  And why is the chef back?
[408.40s -> 412.68s]  I am so confused right now.
[412.68s -> 414.68s]  It's not even funny.
[414.68s -> 418.14s]  I saw a panel over here.
[418.14s -> 419.14s]  Can I like open the panel?
[419.14s -> 422.21s]  I have to be able to open this panel.
[422.21s -> 424.03s]  It's the only thing I can do.
[424.03s -> 432.14s]  That was very easy.
[432.14s -> 433.14s]  Okay.
[433.14s -> 435.72s]  So what is it?
[435.72s -> 437.72s]  Is this like my like secret superhuman lair?
[437.72s -> 441.27s]  Well, I see big red button.
[441.27s -> 443.27s]  That usually means press.
[443.27s -> 445.60s]  Press the big red button.
[445.60s -> 447.28s]  Okay.
[447.28s -> 449.10s]  No.
[449.10s -> 450.10s]  Yes.
[450.10s -> 451.10s]  To the moon.
[452.10s -> 455.28s]  We are going to the stars.
[455.28s -> 456.28s]  Look at that.
[456.28s -> 457.64s]  Okay.
[457.64s -> 459.52s]  I got to beat this.
[459.52s -> 460.96s]  Push it open.
[460.96s -> 461.96s]  Push it.
[461.96s -> 463.20s]  Push the button open.
[463.20s -> 464.20s]  Push the button.
[464.20s -> 465.20s]  Go.
[465.20s -> 466.20s]  Go.
[466.20s -> 468.64s]  Come on.
[468.64s -> 470.00s]  It's a race.
[470.00s -> 472.01s]  I made it.
[472.01s -> 473.01s]  Okay.
[473.01s -> 474.01s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[474.01s -> 475.89s]  Don't get electrocuted.
[475.89s -> 476.89s]  What is going on?
[476.89s -> 478.07s]  What the...
[478.07s -> 479.07s]  All right.
[479.07s -> 480.31s]  I can beat this.
[480.31s -> 482.57s]  I can do this.
[482.57s -> 483.57s]  I can do this.
[483.57s -> 485.84s]  Go.
[485.84s -> 486.84s]  No.
[486.84s -> 487.84s]  Go.
[487.84s -> 489.20s]  Come on.
[489.20s -> 490.70s]  These don't turn off.
[490.70s -> 493.26s]  I have to step over these?
[493.26s -> 495.26s]  Are you serious?
[495.26s -> 496.95s]  Nice and easy.
[496.95s -> 501.56s]  Nice and easy.
[501.56s -> 503.80s]  Nice and easy.
[505.74s -> 508.04s]  Look at my bar on the top left.
[508.04s -> 509.04s]  Holy shit.
[509.04s -> 511.41s]  This is going to be so difficult to do this.
[511.41s -> 516.98s]  I got to get really close.
[519.22s -> 523.15s]  Fuck.
[523.15s -> 524.15s]  I just thought of a brilliant idea.
[524.15s -> 532.60s]  Let's see if it works.
[534.86s -> 536.86s]  It worked, but I'm so tired.
[536.86s -> 537.86s]  Oh, I'm dead.
[537.86s -> 540.86s]  You got me with your lasers.
[542.86s -> 544.86s]  Oh, I'm doing that on purpose.
[544.86s -> 546.42s]  All right.
[546.42s -> 549.42s]  So guys, remember, if you're looking for a technique to beat that really difficult part,
[549.42s -> 551.42s]  just like screw through it.
[551.42s -> 553.43s]  Who cares?
[553.43s -> 555.43s]  Oh, there's a zip line.
[555.43s -> 557.43s]  Oh, this is going to be so dumb.
[557.43s -> 562.19s]  Are you guys ready for how dumb this is really going to be?
[562.19s -> 563.19s]  Here we go.
[563.19s -> 564.62s]  Yay.
[568.08s -> 569.08s]  Yay.
[569.08s -> 570.08s]  That was fun.
[571.25s -> 572.25s]  Oh, God.
[572.25s -> 575.26s]  I would play a game where you just did that.
[575.26s -> 577.26s]  That was like the funnest part of this whole game.
[577.26s -> 580.36s]  Oh, what?
[580.36s -> 581.36s]  Another laser room?
[581.36s -> 588.76s]  Oh, another laser room of, you know, fucking whole room.
[588.76s -> 589.76s]  Go.
[589.76s -> 590.76s]  Go.
[590.76s -> 593.40s]  Yes.
[593.40s -> 594.40s]  Yes.
[595.90s -> 598.90s]  I am the laser room master.
[598.90s -> 602.29s]  Can I pick up one of these rocks?
[602.29s -> 603.29s]  No, no, those aren't rocks.
[603.29s -> 604.29s]  Those are like whistles.
[604.29s -> 605.66s]  Give me one of the whistles.
[605.66s -> 608.22s]  I got to coach my little league team.
[608.22s -> 613.76s]  I've got to be pretty close to being at the end here.
[613.76s -> 615.96s]  Okay.
[615.96s -> 616.96s]  There we are.
[616.96s -> 619.16s]  Elevator.
[619.16s -> 620.16s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[620.16s -> 621.16s]  Hey, whoa, dude.
[621.16s -> 623.16s]  What the fuck is going on?
[623.16s -> 625.49s]  I...
[625.49s -> 627.24s]  What the...
[629.55s -> 635.35s]  Well, the technique always works.
[635.35s -> 643.50s]  Fuck.
[643.50s -> 651.72s]  Fucking God damn it.
[651.72s -> 652.72s]  I don't want to...
[652.72s -> 656.81s]  I had this beat, dude.
[656.81s -> 659.81s]  I had this beat and the game like fucked up.
[659.81s -> 661.18s]  Great.
[670.28s -> 672.90s]  Why did it work the first time?
[672.90s -> 674.90s]  And I can't get it to work again.
[674.90s -> 676.20s]  You got to be kidding me.
[676.20s -> 677.57s]  All right.
[677.57s -> 678.88s]  There's that.
[678.88s -> 680.88s]  I actually have to like do it the right way.
[680.88s -> 683.65s]  How do I crouch?
[683.65s -> 687.00s]  Crouch, huh?
[687.00s -> 688.00s]  There's no way I can crouch.
[688.00s -> 690.27s]  Oh my God.
[690.27s -> 692.27s]  Just go through it, you stupid prick.
[692.27s -> 698.82s]  God.
[698.82s -> 699.82s]  All right.
[699.82s -> 703.34s]  Can I not like glitch into the wall this time?
[703.34s -> 705.34s]  It took me long enough to get back here again.
[705.34s -> 707.28s]  Thank you.
[707.28s -> 708.65s]  My God.
[708.65s -> 710.72s]  There's a present.
[710.72s -> 712.80s]  All right.
[712.80s -> 713.80s]  What do I touch?
[713.80s -> 715.36s]  How about the present?
[715.36s -> 717.53s]  Present looks promising.
[717.53s -> 722.64s]  If I could put...
[722.64s -> 724.64s]  Why am I backwards?
[724.64s -> 729.37s]  Why can I not pick up the present?
[729.37s -> 732.07s]  Oh.
[732.07s -> 733.07s]  I get it.
[733.07s -> 736.72s]  Okay.
[736.72s -> 739.50s]  I did it.
[739.50s -> 740.50s]  All right.
[740.50s -> 741.50s]  So that's beating Octodad.
[741.50s -> 742.50s]  Oh, I beat Octodad.
[742.50s -> 743.74s]  Thanks for playing.
[743.74s -> 744.74s]  All right.
[744.74s -> 745.74s]  What about the roses?
[745.74s -> 747.49s]  I can do anything with the roses?
[747.49s -> 749.44s]  Kind of.
[749.44s -> 750.80s]  All right.
[750.80s -> 753.80s]  Well, thank you guys for watching this Octodad playthrough.
[753.80s -> 758.11s]  Beginning to end sort of with edits in between.
[758.11s -> 761.35s]  Here's a flower for you because I love you.
[761.35s -> 762.52s]  Let me bring it to you.
[762.52s -> 765.66s]  Everybody watching right now.
[765.66s -> 767.66s]  Here's a flower for you.
