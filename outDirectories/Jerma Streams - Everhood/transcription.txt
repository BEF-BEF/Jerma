[2.81s -> 13.75s]  Well hi. What's up? How are ya? Welcome to the stream, as always. My name is Jerbo985.
[14.39s -> 26.62s]  Did you already knew that? You clicked on it. Good afternoon, how are you? Do you? What is that?
[27.43s -> 31.51s]  Don't do anything cool while the ad is going. Oh my, you know what? That's a really good idea.
[35.82s -> 43.88s]  That's true. I should not say anything for the first five minutes ever of any stream. That's right.
[46.47s -> 56.98s]  Because a ton of people are coming in and getting a pre-roll. That's true.
[58.14s -> 62.22s]  All right, well let's just like do nothing. I do nothing for five to ten minutes anyways for the
[62.22s -> 69.03s]  first ten minutes of every stream. You're always late in the first place. You know, all right,
[69.03s -> 72.95s]  let me ask you guys something. Maybe we should poll the community on this because this is important.
[74.81s -> 84.36s]  If I were to hit the live button, right, at 4 p.m. specific, but I just was not here for at least
[84.36s -> 91.93s]  10 to 20 minutes, would you prefer that? Or would you prefer for me just to be ready to go
[92.65s -> 97.37s]  like when the stream comes on, you know within like two to three minutes that we're going to
[97.37s -> 103.59s]  start? What do you prefer? Would you rather just be late or do you want the stream to turn on at
[103.59s -> 111.37s]  four and have this screen on for like 15 to 20 minutes? All right, we want you ready to go.
[112.09s -> 120.98s]  I'd rather you just be late. Okay, be late. All right, second one. Okay, turn it on so we can
[123.90s -> 130.04s]  listen to the music and watch the planets. Yeah, I'm talking about Monk. That's what I mean.
[130.60s -> 139.53s]  I was just watching your Thrillville VOD. I get five to ten instead of 20. Well, it is five.
[139.53s -> 142.41s]  It's 410 right now. I didn't start at 420.
[145.93s -> 148.95s]  We're going to play Everhood today. We're going to continue the playthrough.
[151.77s -> 155.45s]  I don't really know that much about... All right, so the last time I played this,
[155.45s -> 165.42s]  I played it for like 40 minutes and it was really... I was like half a bottle down in wine.
[165.50s -> 170.68s]  I drank like half a bottle of wine. I was just playing it. I didn't really follow the story
[170.68s -> 176.84s]  that much that well. I remember it was fun, but people were like,
[176.84s -> 183.45s]  please, for the love of God, play this game again. I was like, all right, restart the game.
[183.45s -> 194.54s]  No, start over? No, I mean, I played it for like... I remember the gnome stuff. It was fun.
[194.54s -> 197.58s]  I remember the guy would be in like the club and the guy's like, we did like a dance battle.
[205.27s -> 215.35s]  Why do I sound like that? Stop. What's wrong with me? Yeah, but you were drunk.
[215.99s -> 220.54s]  So what? I started the game a little bit on the drunk side.
[222.09s -> 226.97s]  So what? I can't continue that playthrough. It needs to be a clean slate.
[227.69s -> 237.29s]  Well, let me ask you this. How long is this game? Is this game like a four-hour experience?
[237.29s -> 240.01s]  Is this game like a seven-hour experience? How long is the game?
[244.81s -> 247.85s]  It's like about seven hours. Okay. It's like six to seven. All right. Well then,
[248.49s -> 253.66s]  so then I can, I'm guaranteed to be able to finish it tonight then. Like six. Yeah. So then I'm
[253.66s -> 268.14s]  already like four. Yeah. No, no. We're not starting over. Let's go. You guys ready? I'll give... Okay.
[268.14s -> 275.50s]  Here's the story so far. Laser beam dance game. They shoot laser beams at you. You have to dodge
[275.50s -> 280.22s]  it. The music is to the music. There's a beat that plays in the background. You jump over the beat.
[280.22s -> 285.74s]  You dodge the beat and then you beat enemies based on dodging their musical attacks. That's
[285.74s -> 290.22s]  pretty much it. That's all you really need. It's pretty fun. I will tell you right now.
[290.22s -> 296.06s]  Let's get this out of the way as well. There's a, there's a flashing lights warning. I turned on
[296.62s -> 303.82s]  this thing here. So I, the image sensitivity I turned on because I don't really like getting
[303.82s -> 309.14s]  my like face like flashed and shit anyways. So, but just be aware this game is pretty,
[309.14s -> 318.30s]  if you photosensitive, this is like, this is going to be a doozy. Anyways, I'm ready to,
[318.30s -> 326.01s]  I'm ready to rock and roll. You should put up a warning. I think that, does that warning stay
[326.01s -> 339.19s]  in the corner? I don't remember. Let's see. I put it on hard? What? I played this on hard? What?
[342.42s -> 354.63s]  Why did you let me do that? Why would I be on the hardest difficulty guys? What? So this is,
[354.63s -> 360.94s]  but we're only like 30 minutes into the game. I got into this castle. You're good at it. So
[360.94s -> 364.06s]  don't worry. I'll be all right. I got into the castle and I'm about to do like a big castle battle.
[366.01s -> 373.90s]  As expert as well. Yeah, I know. We tried to stop you. You insisted on it. Okay. Well,
[374.54s -> 378.74s]  you should put a warning on screen. Should I actually, because I will if I, if you think I
[378.74s -> 393.37s]  should. No, yes. Yeah. I'm getting a lot of yeses. You should. Yes. Put it in the title. My title is
[393.37s -> 398.97s]  like perfectly carefully comedically crafted. I don't think I want to do that. I'll put it on
[398.97s -> 408.74s]  screen. I'll just put it like kind of in the corner. Your title sucks. Oh yeah.
[408.74s -> 433.78s]  I'm sorry. I've been in a weird mood lately. How's that? Can I have it like kind of down here?
[433.78s -> 445.37s]  Where should it go? Like up here? Is that all right? Is it okay? Put it right in the middle?
[445.37s -> 456.06s]  I'm not going to put it in the middle, dude. What are you talking about? Responsible Annie.
[456.06s -> 467.59s]  I think that's okay. Yeah. I think that's, that's all right. Put it in the stream title.
[467.59s -> 471.67s]  My stream title is perfectly crafted. All right. Well, all right. You guys saw that. Whatever.
[471.67s -> 476.07s]  Fuck. You guys saw the funny joke in the stream title. Who cares about the title? I'll put it in
[476.07s -> 483.37s]  the stream title. You guys already saw the funny stream title, right? And everybody laughed and now
[483.37s -> 492.10s]  all right. Here we go. I, dude, I had this one. It's one of you required to feel the music.
[492.10s -> 512.18s]  Flashing lights. I put it right here. This title has so many brackets. This is the longest title
[512.18s -> 536.42s]  I think I've ever had. This title is too long now. Let me see. Is that better? There we go.
[536.42s -> 541.14s]  Care as somebody said. I don't know. Okay. When I play, people tell me, play Ace Attorney, dude.
[541.14s -> 544.90s]  Play Ace Attorney. Ace Attorney is like so fucking fun. It's like the funnest game. You're going to
[544.90s -> 549.06s]  love it. That's, that's great. I tried to play it. I did because I always try to see if I can
[549.06s -> 555.64s]  record a game or capture it, make sure it doesn't look like shit, right? Um, I can't play Ace Attorney
[555.64s -> 560.12s]  because every 10 seconds the game decides to go like this and I don't know why it goes,
[563.08s -> 570.12s]  and it flashes a white light in your face. It happens every 10 seconds.
[570.12s -> 574.09s]  Anyways, the key to the locked door is somewhere in the maze. I put it there.
[574.09s -> 588.79s]  Maybe it was for the best. Okay. So I got to find the key. Why can't anyone hear me?
[588.79s -> 594.01s]  You were playing the game wrong. You should buy, buy a real copy of the game.
[594.01s -> 601.93s]  It's funny you say that, sir or madam. I actually bought every single version of the game that was
[601.93s -> 607.30s]  available. I bought it on the iPad to see if it had, if it happened on the iPad. I got it across
[607.30s -> 615.58s]  every platform, steam, everywhere, consoles. I purchased that game probably four or five times
[615.58s -> 621.21s]  because I was hoping that one of these versions did not have the flashing white light.
[625.88s -> 632.52s]  Hi-ho-ha. Fancy seeing you here in such a spooky place. I am notice Freddy here. I've heard that
[632.52s -> 638.81s]  this castle has a heart and a soul. Hi, Fanta. What that really means? Maybe it has a secret rooms.
[641.43s -> 664.01s]  Slime. Oh, here we go. Everybody get ready. First banger of the night incoming. You ready?
[665.45s -> 670.81s]  This is Flynn. Welcome to Slime Brothers Plank Service. My name is Flynn and my brother's name
[670.81s -> 677.35s]  is Muck. It's me. We provide a plank renting service. What kind of plank are you looking for?
[677.35s -> 684.60s]  I'm looking for a long plank. Long planks are my favorite, but sadly they are out of stock.
[684.60s -> 692.89s]  Welcome to Slime Brothers Plank Service. My name is Muck and my brother's name is Flynn.
[692.89s -> 702.94s]  Talk to my brother if you want to rent a plank. Welcome to Slime. That's not what he said. I forgot
[702.94s -> 710.41s]  everything about this guy. What was he? I forgot. Well, I don't remember. I'm not kidding. I don't
[710.41s -> 716.95s]  remember what he sounded like. I have no idea. Well, I don't know. I remember he was kind of
[716.95s -> 724.60s]  like Otto on the right, but what did he sound like? Hi, welcome to Slime Brothers Plank Service.
[724.60s -> 731.00s]  My name is Flynn and my brother's name is Muck. It's me. Yes, what do you want? Long plank. Whoa,
[731.00s -> 738.44s]  you know, very long planks are hard to handle. They come at a price. Are you sure? All right,
[739.08s -> 748.95s]  actually, for you to rent a very long plank, you also need. Shoot, I forgot. Hey, Goku. Yeah?
[749.83s -> 755.16s]  What do you need to rent a very long plank? You mean the diploma of certification for
[755.16s -> 762.36s]  handling very long planks? Right. Do you have a certificate for handling very long planks, sir?
[762.36s -> 768.92s]  Yes, I do. Hey, don't pull my leg. You don't have a certification. You're a funny guy. Of course,
[768.92s -> 775.40s]  you're wrong. Don't worry. It's on the house. Hey, Muck. What is it, Flynn? This wood face
[775.40s -> 782.76s]  wants the diploma of certification for handling very long planks. Oh, really? Get ready, matey.
[786.89s -> 814.17s]  Let's go. Turn it up. Oh, this is good. I like it. This is a good song. I drank two copies,
[814.17s -> 830.46s]  by the way, so there's no way I get hit again. Nice. Are they playing? Are they playing like
[830.46s -> 858.98s]  guitars? Just like wood guitars. Oops. Oops. You are worthy of the diploma of certification
[858.98s -> 867.37s]  for handling very long planks. Now it's up on the wall. And of course, here's your very long plank.
[868.33s -> 885.10s]  God. Let's pick it up. You picked up the very long plank as my diploma. The diploma reads
[885.10s -> 891.40s]  diploma of certification for handling very long planks. One who has earned the certificate has
[891.48s -> 896.36s]  not only amassed a body of knowledge pursuant to handling very long planks, but also has demonstrated
[896.36s -> 902.78s]  proficiency in wicked dance moves and an impeccable personal style. Displayed in the medium of groovy
[902.78s -> 907.18s]  beats, we, the Slime Brothers Plank Service, present with this diploma evidence that they have
[907.18s -> 912.60s]  fulfilled all necessary requirements as given with confidence that the individual is equipped
[912.60s -> 917.51s]  by grace of Slime Brothers to meet their challenge in life as a strong, willful, and plank-possessing
[917.51s -> 926.62s]  individual. What a nice diploma. Please leave your diploma here. I have only five voices.
[926.62s -> 944.22s]  Okay, so I have a plank now. Where do I put that? Oh, it's this guy. I remember this guy.
[946.95s -> 953.51s]  Oh, it's you again. What the hell do you want? You'll be annoying somewhere else. I'm busy,
[953.51s -> 972.81s]  can you tell? Fuck off. Here's the plank right here. Gotta be careful. Certified welder? Oh,
[972.81s -> 993.34s]  save the game. Right. I forgot the lanterns did that. Save. Hello? Nose-far-ot-choo.
[993.98s -> 1002.42s]  That was a sneeze joke. I warn you red. Amazed monster lurks here. If it finds you,
[1002.42s -> 1014.62s]  try to scare it. Monster guards something. If. Sorry, forgot what it was.
[1015.18s -> 1025.61s]  Okay, just look around here first. Are there any items in this game or is it just a bunch of
[1025.61s -> 1062.25s]  dances? What the fuck was that? Okay. Oh my god. Oh shit. Nice. Gotta stay on the left side after
[1062.25s -> 1079.62s]  this. Oh my god. Okay. Jesus. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I'm ready. I'm ready. Holy shit.
[1080.34s -> 1103.91s]  Oh my fucking lord. All right. I gotta, I gotta stay on the left side. Definitely.
[1104.47s -> 1124.95s]  Could be right. What the fuck am I supposed to do about that one? What was that button? That was
[1124.95s -> 1144.09s]  like a Sonic the Hedgehog spring. Nice. All right. Fucking idiot. I need full health for this.
[1144.65s -> 1176.57s]  All right. All right. Right. Jesus god. I gotta get that one down. All right. So
[1177.21s -> 1189.80s]  what does the red button do? Do I touch the button? I like the song though. I gotta put
[1189.80s -> 1202.86s]  both headphones in. That's a problem. Stupid fucking idiot. All right. Stop, stop, stop.
[1202.86s -> 1256.81s]  Stop, stop. I jumped over the button. I button button. Where's the button? Here it comes. Fuck
[1256.81s -> 1272.38s]  you. Fuck. Shut up. Not you. You don't have to shut up. It's me that has to shut up.
[1273.26s -> 1283.40s]  Ugh. All right. I swear to god. I'm just, it's, it's just a reaction. It's hitting the jump button
[1283.40s -> 1305.38s]  on everything. It's, I have to jump, jump, jump. Oh my god. He's running around. He's running around.
[1305.38s -> 1315.90s]  He's running around. What do I do? Where do I go? Oh, you found a crystal key. Give me out.
[1315.90s -> 1345.59s]  I hide. Oh, give me out. Can I dodge him when he goes down the hall? I did it. I got it. Maze
[1345.59s -> 1366.18s]  monster lurks here. Okay. I got the key. So I got the key. Okay. This is my room. It ain't much.
[1368.50s -> 1378.20s]  Sorry. It'd be nice if I had some more furniture. Game console with super racket inserted.
[1379.40s -> 1393.21s]  Wanna play some super racket with me? Sure. Okay. I warn you. I'm quite good. Hey. Sega.
[1401.27s -> 1417.50s]  Oh, we actually are doing this. Deflect with X. Okay. Someone just did that inside of my head.
[1417.58s -> 1422.76s]  That sucked. I don't want to hear that again. I don't want to hear that noise ever again.
[1422.76s -> 1456.28s]  Okay. I can just, it's too much. If you ever want to play again, I will be here. That was kind of
[1456.28s -> 1465.46s]  cool. You're pretty good at this. I mean, I'm playing, I, I got to give myself credit.
[1465.46s -> 1472.95s]  If anything that you require me to press a button at a certain time, I've made this remark before
[1472.95s -> 1478.07s]  and some of the new viewers can listen to this as well. If a game has four face buttons and it's
[1478.07s -> 1486.25s]  in a control stick, I will be able to do good at that game. If we're talking four buttons,
[1486.89s -> 1497.80s]  that's it. If there is like a dodge, a punch, and like a run, I will do good in that game.
[1497.80s -> 1513.53s]  Save the game, right? What about Minecraft? Well, no, no, no, no. So I'm sorry.
[1513.53s -> 1518.57s]  Minecraft has way more shit to do. There's like a crafting menu. You have to press like a,
[1518.57s -> 1523.43s]  you have to combine. No, no, no. If the only thing you do in the game is jump,
[1524.15s -> 1536.81s]  dodge and attack and move, I will be, I will win. Careful with that stuff. Doors unlocked.
[1536.81s -> 1545.54s]  What about Dark Souls? Well, here's the thing. Dark Souls, you don't, I could literally use the
[1545.54s -> 1548.50s]  default weapon in Dark Souls you find in the very beginning and you still get through the game.
[1551.24s -> 1554.68s]  You can find like some shitty katana on the ground in Dark Souls and you could,
[1554.68s -> 1571.66s]  you could get through the game. It doesn't matter. Hey, did I lose? What happened? Oh,
[1571.66s -> 1593.35s]  okay. Okay. What? Okay. It's, I get it. Hey, you got to go up some, it's a joke. Up, up.
[1593.35s -> 1606.18s]  How do I go up from here? Yeah. I'm not playing your game. That's down. How do I know which one
[1606.18s -> 1624.65s]  goes up? Oh, okay. I got it. You picked up the handle piece of a door. I'm bored. I'm going to
[1624.65s -> 1629.93s]  go read Calvin and Hobbes. I mean, I've, I've completely, I put a stamp of approval on that.
[1629.93s -> 1640.55s]  Calvin and Hobbes is fucking one of the greatest ever. I, I, I can like say that that's a good
[1640.55s -> 1645.43s]  idea. I mean, like we've probably got like German 985, Calvin and Hobbes, and Garfield is like the
[1645.43s -> 1652.02s]  best cartoon characters probably ever, right? So that's okay. You have the biggest challenge ahead
[1652.02s -> 1660.15s]  of you. This is the mirror of truth and I will allow you to leave my castle, which is probably
[1660.15s -> 1669.86s]  up here. John R. Buckle. I am royal guard of castle. My guard important. Very important.
[1672.54s -> 1683.56s]  Enter alone only. What? Why? Rules are rules. I don't have any legs and this guy is mute.
[1683.56s -> 1703.64s]  Did you really deny us entrance? Hey, were you only? Okay. Hey, how's the mirror? Okay.
[1712.76s -> 1727.38s]  I, um, let's walk around it. I think you should keep trying to look at the mirror. Maybe try to
[1727.38s -> 1752.49s]  examine it from the other sides. I just did that. This is my first dream. Say hi. What's going on?
[1752.49s -> 1764.81s]  Just stare at it? What if I just don't move and look at it? It's not even a mirror.
[1772.22s -> 1784.70s]  Okay. I don't, it's not doing anything. What? What's to happen? Oh, look at you. Look at me.
[1784.70s -> 1790.33s]  What gives you the right to come here and control me? I wish you would just leave.
[1790.97s -> 1802.41s]  You disgust me. This wooden cage. Not always been like this. Divided myself into pieces.
[1805.59s -> 1815.80s]  Everyone, once you leave, I have to deal with everything. He's made it a wood. It would be
[1815.80s -> 1822.81s]  like creaking and shit. I'm the actor. You're not an actor. I hate you for it. I wish you would just
[1822.81s -> 1846.65s]  stop. I want you to leave. I don't want to talk to you again. This guy's so annoying. Okay. I leave.
[1846.65s -> 1876.38s]  This is like, this is you and your emo phase. Talk to me. I'm rural guard. I guard important,
[1876.38s -> 1883.56s]  very important. I leave now? Well done, little puppet. You are a one step closer to helping us
[1883.56s -> 1891.70s]  all. In another time, you will come back and you will slay the beast within and passage will open.
[1891.70s -> 1909.13s]  The end is nearing us. You are now free to leave. Oh, hold on. My headphones got tied up. That's
[1909.13s -> 1922.87s]  kind of hard to use. This is kind of cool. I should play Noita. I have played Noita and it created a
[1922.87s -> 1933.13s]  big problem for me. All right. Yeah. I'm just untying my headphones so they can sit on my ears
[1933.13s -> 1947.43s]  better. Okay. What's over here? Come on and experience the race of your lifetime. We let's
[1947.43s -> 1966.44s]  go. All right. It's pretty good. Oh, look at them braces go. Someday I hope to win. My sibling is
[1966.44s -> 1972.20s]  into fantasy games. All right. I'll tell you, I have both headphones in and it's loud for me because
[1972.20s -> 1975.56s]  obviously I want to feel the music. That's a requirement. Otherwise, you know, the exit signs.
[1976.36s -> 1980.60s]  So, but I can, I can't hear myself talk. So it's hard to like talk. I don't even know what I sound
[1980.60s -> 1992.14s]  like right now. I have no idea what I sound like. You sound like you're drunk. I'm so, I can't hear
[1992.14s -> 2005.94s]  myself talk, which means I can't talk well. Why me? Why me? Why me? It's the point of learning
[2005.94s -> 2011.91s]  new skills. You'll just get bored and forget all that knowledge over time. Maintaining your driving
[2011.91s -> 2017.03s]  skills, for example. What does anyone get out of that anyways? I guess when it comes down to it,
[2017.03s -> 2021.51s]  I need to stop thinking about the future. Enjoy what's in front of me instead of what's ahead.
[2022.47s -> 2027.48s]  So that's why they've had like 10 wow expansions. The exact reason you're describing.
[2028.28s -> 2034.71s]  I have to treat my life like I'm going through a cave full of gems and try to collect as many as
[2034.71s -> 2043.51s]  I can because otherwise what's the point? Wow reference minus two. No, no, it wasn't. No,
[2043.51s -> 2051.34s]  it wasn't. Hi there, a red rider. Can you smell the gasoline? Can you feel the thrill? Are you
[2051.34s -> 2060.70s]  getting pumped? Do you want to participate in the race? Yes. Oh, exciting. Let us get you our cart.
[2061.34s -> 2073.29s]  Wait, I actually get to drive this? Welcome all racers. Tonight and all other nights,
[2073.29s -> 2086.60s]  we will race until the end of time. Why am I the other way back here? This isn't fair. What?
[2088.20s -> 2105.00s]  Brattle is A. Oh my God. Are you serious? I'm so bad at games like this. I thought I had to pick
[2105.08s -> 2115.80s]  stuff up. I don't know. I just, I thought I had to pick something up. Oh, this is crazy.
[2118.33s -> 2120.57s]  Shit. I'm not going to be able to beat this. I can't win this.
[2121.93s -> 2133.90s]  My God, it's too fast. No, I'm just towed. Oh, this is what it feels like to be fucking towed.
[2136.38s -> 2151.53s]  I'm in 20th place still. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it.
[2153.48s -> 2161.26s]  Fuck. It's hard. Don't get lapped like towed. Don't get lapped like towed on Bowser's cape, please.
[2167.75s -> 2173.70s]  It's hard to tell where they're coming at that down the road.
[2182.18s -> 2203.78s]  It's too hard. It's no idea. It's too much. Both headphones in visual stimulation.
[2204.42s -> 2216.10s]  I'm going at warp speed. I'll get it. I'll get it. Just relax everybody. Hold on.
[2217.14s -> 2269.24s]  All right. There we go. There we go. Slow down. Come on. Come on. Right for the middle.
[2269.24s -> 2291.50s]  Come on. It's right there. Damn it. How? No, no, it's right here. I, I still got it. I have a chance.
[2292.94s -> 2298.44s]  Oh, that was a choke. It was a choke. It's all right. I get it this time.
[2299.72s -> 2334.81s]  Okay. Let's go. Let's go. I'm coming to first place now. Let's go. See, now I get it right here.
[2344.18s -> 2358.46s]  You pushed me off the road. Fuck you. Don't hold the acceleration the whole time.
[2358.94s -> 2377.88s]  In much better position than I was last time. Red is climbing through the ranks.
[2390.98s -> 2398.62s]  Who's in first place? It's always Mario and Luigi. It's such poor shit. And if you get even remotely
[2398.62s -> 2408.07s]  close to either one of those two assholes, they go. And they don't even have a star. It's so fucking
[2408.07s -> 2430.74s]  stupid. That game sucks. All right. Hold on. Don't blow it. Can anybody even hear me? I don't even
[2430.74s -> 2450.63s]  know what I'm gonna be talking. Hey, good. Just don't hit anything. I'm right here.
[2460.30s -> 2485.66s]  It's right behind me. It's right up ahead. Oh, I just scared the shit out of me. Yes. Yes. Nice.
[2485.66s -> 2493.03s]  All right. I guess you can hear what I was saying. Anytime in Mario, uh, Mario Kart Super Nintendo,
[2494.01s -> 2503.16s]  you get close to Mario or Luigi. They just have a star. It's so, it's annoying. They're always in
[2503.16s -> 2514.46s]  first and second place. Congratulations on finishing in first place. Here is your trophy.
[2515.58s -> 2528.89s]  Oh, trophy. You picked up a trophy. What does that do? Do it multiple times. Wait, do the race
[2528.89s -> 2538.55s]  multiple times? It doesn't do anything. It does literally nothing. Oh, that's still fun. Hi, ho.
[2538.55s -> 2546.42s]  Welcome. Welcome. I am Cassius. Come and run my humble obstacle course. It ain't much, but it's
[2546.42s -> 2551.78s]  something. Hi. I will reward you with something yummy. If you beat the universal record,
[2552.42s -> 2559.42s]  you want to run the obstacle course? Make sure to stretch first. I'm not muted. Stop. I can see my
[2559.42s -> 2581.77s]  indicators. Ready? Three, two, one, action. Oh, this is bad. I got to use analog for this. Or do I?
[2581.77s -> 2609.26s]  How do I sprint? Oh, did I do it? I got it. You beat the record. Receive your award outside.
[2610.22s -> 2622.57s]  Well done. You'll be rewarded with a homemade, delicious, scrumptious cake. Okay. Maybe you can
[2622.57s -> 2632.38s]  give it to a friend. Picked up a cake. I like this kind of little mini games. I like this.
[2632.38s -> 2651.03s]  Only VIPs allowed. Oh, no need to eat. I know the taste. Anything else I can do? What's he doing?
[2651.67s -> 2667.53s]  Look at them racers go. Okay. Okay. So that's, I got to go in the VIP room. Let's do it.
[2668.49s -> 2678.47s]  Who are we theater? Who are we watching? Hello Red. I sometimes come here to relax.
[2681.14s -> 2689.37s]  Just to let my mind wander a bit and forget about it all. I got it right. Good. Sorry.
[2693.48s -> 2703.16s]  Here comes my favorite part. Wow, that was cool. Look at that. I got to share that with you stranger.
[2710.49s -> 2727.77s]  Okay. Anything I can do over here? Dude, this would be so bad for you. Imagine sitting this
[2727.77s -> 2734.41s]  close to a screen like this and having your eyes open. Oh, it hurts to think about that.
[2740.41s -> 2757.82s]  All right. That was cool. This is fun. Imagine being that close to your stream.
[2761.69s -> 2775.38s]  VOD watcher point of view. We had a good time. It didn't. It's not the door we came from.
[2775.94s -> 2807.16s]  That was quite a fall. Okay. What's up with this? He picked up a shiny gem. He over here.
[2807.16s -> 2843.77s]  Wait, did I look up here? I like the song so far. This is the best song, best character coming up.
[2843.77s -> 2868.54s]  Cool. Whoa. What's that? You found my eye. Please give it to me. Sure. Yes, I am finally restored.
[2871.99s -> 2876.70s]  I can't believe you have all people saved me. What's that supposed to mean?
[2877.18s -> 2886.86s]  Are you here as well, little red nose? Aiding the enemy? What? The enemy? The enemy is gold pig.
[2891.24s -> 2899.06s]  I might have been lost to the woods for ages, but you are the one who is truly lost. Anyway,
[2899.06s -> 2905.14s]  I am not without honor. You have helped me. So I am in your debt. Now that my vision is restored,
[2905.14s -> 2911.46s]  I can use my magic. You seem to be missing an arm. Maybe I can help by removing this giant
[2911.46s -> 2921.16s]  boulder in your way. Should we teleport it away? Destroy it? Why not transform it?
[2922.74s -> 2930.17s]  Now it's a Mario cube. How delightful. Maze transformed the giant rock into a clay pod.
[2930.17s -> 2936.07s]  This is what happens when you do voices for too long. I will now consider the debt repaid.
[2936.87s -> 2940.79s]  I am still thankful for you bringing me my eye, red. I will remember that.
[2948.01s -> 2963.10s]  You can go now. There is no reason for you to continue to stand there. Apparently. Hey,
[2963.10s -> 2970.58s]  hold on a second. Now that the debt has been repaid, you are still the enemy.
[2971.30s -> 2977.70s]  Seeing you in such a weakened state, it would be unfortunate if I didn't, you know, exploit the
[2977.70s -> 3041.96s]  situation. Oh, I didn't press the button. This might be my favorite song so far. Oh, damn. Seems
[3041.96s -> 3047.72s]  you are still strong even without your arm. But you know, I don't really care about any of this.
[3047.72s -> 3052.68s]  I just want to have a good time. Thanks to you now I can. I won't forget that you helped me.
[3052.68s -> 3058.76s]  I won't bother you anymore unless you bother me. Have fun in the mushroom forest. I have enjoyed
[3058.76s -> 3064.12s]  enough here without going insane. That reminds me, I'm extremely late to an appointment. See you
[3064.12s -> 3075.45s]  around. Are we in the mushroom forest? Well, this is on hard. There's something about this place I
[3075.45s -> 3102.86s]  can't remember. Funny. Wait, this looks like a cave. Oh, oops. I feel like this is about to get weird.
[3102.86s -> 3119.02s]  Everything's slowing down. I obviously follow the rabbit, but. I am the guardian of the mushroom
[3119.02s -> 3125.82s]  forest. There will come a time when we shall talk, but it will not be tonight.
[3139.96s -> 3150.81s]  So unfair. Everyone took the good hiding places. You still have seven to find. Oh, great. You found
[3150.81s -> 3161.21s]  me. I don't consider myself so good at hiding as the others. We still have six to find. Whoa,
[3162.60s -> 3181.08s]  you found me. You still have to find five more. See you around, dude. Oh, thank God. Are you Swedish?
[3181.08s -> 3189.82s]  No. If you spend too much time in the mushroom forest, you might change. What does that mean?
[3189.82s -> 3203.94s]  Oh, you found me. I think you should be reevaluating my invisibility spell. You
[3203.94s -> 3209.48s]  still have four to find. By the way, we never figured out what that was from. It was not from
[3209.48s -> 3227.32s]  that TV show. I don't know what it's from. Oh, you really stepped into something bad now.
[3231.56s -> 3239.40s]  Another weirdo. Oh, let me get my weirdo voice ready. One, two, three, me, me, me, weirdo. Incoming.
[3241.24s -> 3245.80s]  I have finally caught the wooden pestilence. I'll make sure it won't be able to escape.
[3246.52s -> 3257.48s]  With my defibrillatory stun gun, it will hurt. It will take months before we can use that stun gun
[3257.48s -> 3263.16s]  again. We'd better make the best out of this opportunity. Grundel, go pick it up and bring
[3263.16s -> 3271.86s]  it to the land now, Grundel. What are you doing? Hurry up. I've had enough of a weirdo for you.
[3271.86s -> 3295.70s]  You doofus. Here comes the weird guy. Don't you know that Gerber does weird characters
[3295.70s -> 3301.35s]  and he loves to do them. Even though they all sound like this. Every single one of them.
[3301.35s -> 3313.61s]  It works, I think, though, for most characters. You got to just do the weird guy. That's it.
[3315.34s -> 3330.57s]  I thought I was supposed to find mushrooms. Oh, back to the bunny. I mean, I just got
[3331.53s -> 3339.59s]  captured. What are you talking about? What happened? Never mind. You can't talk anyway.
[3339.59s -> 3348.76s]  Kick me up and let's get out of here. I do anything else here? He's doing anything?
[3348.76s -> 3353.64s]  I don't even want to talk about the things I've seen here. You can save your progress here.
[3353.64s -> 3368.98s]  Do you want to save? Yes. Good luck getting out of here. Are you going in the light? Get out of the
[3368.98s -> 3385.03s]  way. Step away or prepare for trouble. I wonder what this song will be. He's got one huge arm.
[3386.87s -> 3439.96s]  Not bad so far. Oh, my lord. Oh, fuck. God damn it. That got hard. Relax, relax, relax, relax, relax,
[3439.96s -> 3480.31s]  relax. You got to hug the left side when he does that weird bone. Here we go. You idiot.
[3480.31s -> 3520.71s]  That was so easy. You good? All right. That was a good one, too.
[3520.71s -> 3543.11s]  I didn't do it. I promise. I didn't do it. No, I didn't. Strange looking machine.
[3551.88s -> 3555.64s]  You have awakened just in time. My masterpiece is about to be unleashed.
[3555.64s -> 3558.97s]  I have constructed an artificial replication of an ancient creature.
[3559.69s -> 3564.01s]  Its raw energy makes it so powerful that it can only exist for a limited time.
[3564.57s -> 3570.07s]  The only chance to bring you down and establish peace once and for all. Prepare to face your doom,
[3570.07s -> 3612.30s]  red beige. What's wrong? What happened? Did I lose? What? How could you have defeated my masterpiece
[3612.30s -> 3619.98s]  so swiftly? It didn't even stand a chance. Even more powerful than I imagined. It must be another
[3619.98s -> 3636.52s]  way. We will meet again, red marauder. Okay. The door is shut tight. All right. Go get the
[3636.52s -> 3644.22s]  mushrooms. Go back and get the mushrooms. Can I get, can I go back from here? There's no door.
[3644.22s -> 3667.93s]  I can't go anywhere from here. Are you enjoying the game? This is great to go down. What the hell
[3667.93s -> 3681.16s]  is going on in here? This is freaking me out. Oh, actually, you know what? You're going to think
[3681.16s -> 3687.00s]  I'm crazy for a second, but trust me, I'm doing this for a reason. I need to move that over the
[3687.00s -> 3692.44s]  dead pixel. Let me get it in the right spot. I have a dead pixel on my monitor. And I think
[3692.44s -> 3699.00s]  that actually, if I move it to this right spot, it'll fix it. Right. Let's see. It's like, how do
[3699.00s -> 3710.42s]  I move it? I can move it over here. All right. It's, it's on the dead pixel right now. It only
[3710.42s -> 3717.59s]  works for some types of, it takes hours for that shit to work. Does it? It's not going to work if
[3717.59s -> 3727.48s]  I sit here. Oh, well. Yeah. It's, it's green. The pixels. So it's not a dead pixel. It's a stuck pixel.
[3728.12s -> 3734.44s]  All right. Who are you? You're everywhere. What do they want? Let me be. I don't want to make it
[3734.44s -> 3738.92s]  stop. I don't want to make it stop. Make it stop. Make it stop. Make it stop. Make it stop. Make it
[3738.92s -> 3746.58s]  stop. Make it stop. The TV. How long must I endure? How long has it been? How long has it been? How
[3746.58s -> 3752.87s]  long has it been? Who said that? Who's there? Stop laughing at me. It hurts. I just want it to stop.
[3752.87s -> 3756.39s]  It hurts. Just want to stop. Rest a bit. Please. I don't want it to just stop. I don't want it to
[3756.39s -> 3760.47s]  hurt. Stop it. Don't do it. Stop. Stop it. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop it. All right. I'm getting out
[3760.47s -> 3765.88s]  of here. No, I didn't want to do that again. Do I keep talking to them? It never ends. Why won't it
[3765.88s -> 3772.22s]  end? Must I suffer forever? It never ends. That damn mage. Why does it torture me? I want to leave.
[3772.22s -> 3780.12s]  I don't know where to go. I'm useless. They're everywhere. Okay. Well, I turned off the TV. Can
[3780.12s -> 3795.82s]  they leave now? I don't know. It's an average Jerma viewer. You can, you can leave whenever you want.
[3795.82s -> 3816.90s]  I don't know. I'm not holding you here. Why do you think we can leave? I don't know because you can.
[3818.02s -> 3825.45s]  All the circumstances are optimal. I have analyzed the triggering factors of what is considered a
[3825.45s -> 3831.05s]  battle using quantum theory to artificially create a battle that is not considered a battle.
[3833.02s -> 3837.42s]  You can't resort to your dirty tricks, red mage. This will be the end of you.
[3841.94s -> 3887.29s]  Oh, I can run. There's no jumping. All right. What do you got? What do you got? What do you got?
[3887.29s -> 3941.24s]  What's going on? I have to attack it? Yikes. Yikes. Oh, I thought it was over.
[3955.56s -> 3969.88s]  Fuck. That was sick. Remarkable. My efforts have proven futile once again. Is there nothing that
[3969.88s -> 3976.79s]  can stop you? Hope you find it in your heart to forgive my actions. I just want to find a solution.
[3977.59s -> 3987.80s]  This won't be the last time we meet, red mage. That was cool. I can go in there.
[3989.16s -> 3996.44s]  We're all being paid by your mother to watch this stream. None of them want to be here.
[3996.68s -> 4005.06s]  Nobody wants to be here. Okay. If my mother was paying each of you $1 to be here every stream,
[4005.06s -> 4014.01s]  that's almost $17,000 a stream. That's extreme. I stream probably two days a week.
[4014.57s -> 4021.11s]  You're talking about like $40,000 a week that my mother is paying to have you all be here.
[4021.11s -> 4028.57s]  But that's $160,000 a month. So you're telling me that my mother is spending more than 1.1 or
[4028.57s -> 4033.37s]  1.2 million dollars a year just to have you stay here and pretend to like the stream.
[4033.37s -> 4045.00s]  And that's only if you were getting $1 to be here. And I'll be honest with you, right? Think about
[4045.00s -> 4050.90s]  that. If somebody were to ask you to, hey, I want you to go watch this stream for, you know,
[4050.90s -> 4055.72s]  four to six hours, I'll give you a dollar. You'd be like, no fucking way. You'd be like, make it
[4055.72s -> 4062.52s]  $50. You're not doing that for a dollar. You're doing that for at least like $30 to $40, at least.
[4062.52s -> 4071.64s]  There's no way you're going to do that for that little. Like, if my mother's not giving you at
[4071.64s -> 4077.85s]  least like a 20 or like at least about 30 bucks to be there. Uh-uh. There's no way. I want to get
[4077.85s -> 4089.82s]  that. Can you imagine? Can you actually imagine if like, I was actually truly paying people to stay
[4089.82s -> 4097.93s]  here and you guys are not bots. You're just, I'm actually like hiring people to pretend to be an
[4097.93s -> 4119.94s]  audience. That would be so weird. When's the paycheck? Okay. No, no, no, don't go back in.
[4120.66s -> 4129.69s]  Happy Saturday. Yeah. Happy Saturday. Okay. Now we're looking for the mushrooms or maybe not.
[4129.69s -> 4144.02s]  Professor Orange has sent a message. They have failed to annihilate the doll.
[4144.82s -> 4152.65s]  Yes. But then we moved back to our hideout. That doll to the hillside back. It's a grand similar
[4152.65s -> 4158.86s]  affection. Orange messages that there is a doll picked at the blue door piece that Orange has
[4158.86s -> 4168.55s]  left before it left. What? Sir, the doll has given the kiss, the cursed kiss. Yes. The doll
[4168.55s -> 4179.50s]  is still there. The doll can hear us. It's using some sort of telepathic magic.
[4181.50s -> 4186.78s]  How long is it with this thing? I can just swap the magic if you desire, golden pig.
[4187.90s -> 4207.77s]  Not another word. I'll do it right. I'll do it myself. Are you all right?
[4211.69s -> 4242.26s]  Okay. You kind of Zoey's out there for a while. Looking for mushrooms. Can I run down?
[4242.26s -> 4254.26s]  I'm not making any sense. I made it to the other side. All right. Mushrooms. Hello there.
[4254.26s -> 4267.34s]  Do you want to save? Yes, I do. Change. All right. All right. All right. Hi. I guess you found me.
[4267.34s -> 4283.53s]  You still have three to find. Bye. Three more. I think I already went up by this one. Oh, hello.
[4283.53s -> 4296.46s]  I guess you did find me. You still have two to find. Well, find the bunny. All right. I'll get
[4296.46s -> 4308.15s]  the bunny. I already went up here. Is this one? Oh, you found me. I knew I should have
[4308.15s -> 4314.68s]  chosen a better hiding spot. You still have one to find. Oh, don't even start doing more to you,
[4314.68s -> 4319.67s]  idiot. All right. I got them all. Hi. It was the last mushroom. We'll be waiting by the forest
[4319.67s -> 4343.43s]  guardian far to the west. Whoa. Oh, it's this person. Right. Okay. Right now you are the
[4343.43s -> 4352.57s]  annoying audio book voice actor you complained about. I'm not. No, I'm not actually. No, I didn't
[4352.57s -> 4358.74s]  complain about audio books. I just said it's hard to be an audio book voice narrator because
[4358.74s -> 4364.79s]  you have to do like 60 people's voices over the course of the whole story because even the best
[4364.79s -> 4368.79s]  voice actors in the room in the room, I was going to say even the best voice actors in the room.
[4370.95s -> 4373.67s]  If you tell them to do all their voices back to back to back to back,
[4374.47s -> 4380.23s]  you will be able to tell it's the same person. You will. Nobody can be different people.
[4380.79s -> 4392.58s]  For instance, I am the guardian of the Muslim forest. I will open a passage for you. Let me
[4392.58s -> 4398.82s]  tell you that this is entirely optional. You're not forced to be here. This is only for those
[4398.82s -> 4407.22s]  seeking answers. There will come a time when we shall talk, but it will not be tonight.
[4408.50s -> 4417.19s]  Hey, that was me talking. You knew that was me talking. Why? Why can't I go in there? He
[4417.19s -> 4428.90s]  found us all. What the hell? Hi there. You found us. Go talk to the divine mushroom.
[4428.90s -> 4450.76s]  Look at the divine mushroom. Welcome to my domain. Your efforts in indulging my kin.
[4450.76s -> 4463.18s]  For giving them some joy, I cannot offer you much. I can't offer you much, but I can give you
[4463.82s -> 4471.45s]  a bathroom break. You need to pee very badly. Enjoy the break while you pee.
[4473.21s -> 4481.98s]  Drinking water all day. Be right back before I do another big, big one. Oh,
[4481.98s -> 4718.25s]  it's still the Christmas thing. Hey, it's still Christmas in my mind. I'll be right back. I just
[4718.25s -> 4725.10s]  want to grab some beef jerky too. I promise that I won't choke on it and inhale it like I did in the
[4725.10s -> 4742.10s]  little ring string. Sponsored? I didn't tell you what brand I'm eating. Sponsored by who?
[4750.15s -> 4765.08s]  Sponsored by the beef industry. Beef industry sponsor. I'm not in Congress. I don't have
[4765.08s -> 4772.30s]  lobbyists. What are you talking about? I really liked his streams. Once the big beef industry
[4772.30s -> 4790.54s]  got involved and started lobbying him. What? All right. I'm ready. What'd you say? I like this
[4790.54s -> 4798.71s]  comment. I bet your breath always smells like you just ate jerky. It's not garlic. I'm not eating
[4798.71s -> 4802.95s]  cloves of garlic. Beef jerky does not stay with you in your clothes and shit. It's just like
[4802.95s -> 4826.90s]  fucking, what are you talking about? What are you on about? It still has an aroma. Okay. What
[4826.90s -> 4834.79s]  about every other food? Do you have like, like chicken nugget breath? Did you eat a bowl of
[4834.79s -> 4841.51s]  cereal? Are you going to have like, like wheat grass on your breath? No, I think your breath
[4841.51s -> 4848.17s]  just stinks. That's it. Nobody knows what you had for dinner. They just know that you smell.
[4859.08s -> 4867.67s]  Holly's. There you go. There's your proof. Holly literally just said, I don't smell like beef.
[4867.67s -> 4885.08s]  Like I don't smell like a meat aroma. Confirmed. My headcanon is that you smell like weed.
[4885.80s -> 4897.45s]  Why wouldn't, why are you headcanoning what I smell like? You know what? You know what I do smell
[4897.45s -> 4911.75s]  like? I smell like a dryer sheet. I smell like a dryer sheet and motor oil together. You know,
[4911.75s -> 4921.05s]  you understand? Like it's just light motor oil and dryer sheet. Maybe like a hint of grilled onions.
[4933.82s -> 4940.65s]  What a disgusting smell. Are you willing to risk your soul? Yes. I am neither glad nor sad. You
[4940.65s -> 4947.98s]  smell like piss. I do not smell like piss. I'm very, if I'm not going to mess around and be
[4947.98s -> 4954.23s]  honest with you, I'm very aware of how I smell. I always am trying to be like clean. I always want
[4954.23s -> 4958.65s]  my clothes to be clean. I always want to be able to have a shower before I go anywhere or do anything.
[4958.65s -> 4969.72s]  I always am very aware of my like cleanliness of my body. Just go. All right. Settle down. Relax.
[4969.72s -> 4986.47s]  I'm just hanging out. Find peace in your endeavors. Take a few steps back, please.
[4986.47s -> 5027.82s]  Good. Now let this happen. Things might get strange. Ow. All right. It's a worm fight. Whoa.
[5029.61s -> 5068.44s]  Time to get weird. What the fuck? Shit. Whoa. I can't even see that. Hello, human.
[5071.78s -> 5088.73s]  And you see us. I don't know what I'm supposed to be looking for. Jesus. Why are you here?
[5089.53s -> 5121.93s]  Oh, fuck. This is so wild. You are hurting. Please quit. Never. I'll never quit.
[5122.57s -> 5135.43s]  I will give it 100% always and potentially go beyond. 110%. I hurt my throat doing that. Why?
[5183.18s -> 5197.69s]  Seems that you are back. Did you know what you were getting yourself into?
[5198.25s -> 5207.08s]  You don't have to keep coming back. You're always watching. I hope you're enjoying yourself.
[5207.64s -> 5216.04s]  That you have something to do. Being it. It's not always easy. Have you come to hear an absolute
[5216.04s -> 5227.18s]  truth? Yes. There is a risk you might change upon hearing it. Sometimes not for the better.
[5228.30s -> 5241.66s]  Are you sure you want to hear an absolute truth? It doesn't feel like the machine else come in.
[5241.74s -> 5253.19s]  There are several absolute truths. One of them is you are me and I am you.
[5254.07s -> 5263.51s]  Even the ones you hate and love remain true to yourself. Your thoughts were never yours anyways.
[5264.70s -> 5272.79s]  Take this truth and it is now in your hands to truly interpret. It's humor is how you wanted
[5272.79s -> 5278.74s]  to experience this life. I told you many times to not go through with this. I thought it would be
[5278.74s -> 5286.54s]  fun and here you are. We look forward to sitting talking and laughing about all this when you
[5286.54s -> 5294.01s]  return. You must go forward. We will let you return to your world. We hope you find what
[5294.01s -> 5305.62s]  you're looking for. You must now leave. It's turning British. Welcome back. I hope you enjoyed
[5305.62s -> 5311.40s]  that experience. You strike me as an adventurous sport. Take this precious gemstone. It might be
[5311.40s -> 5327.38s]  useful someday. Maybe not this day. You picked up a ruby. Thanks. All right. New item. Can I go in
[5327.38s -> 5335.98s]  here now? Guarding the forest. Do I have to pay him in a ruby? You smell like Sour Patch Kids
[5335.98s -> 5350.47s]  and old cigarette butts. So I smell like a movie theater? I smell like the outside of a movie
[5350.47s -> 5367.66s]  theater. Now that's an absolute truth. All right. Whatever. Would you like an absolute truth? Yes.
[5369.35s -> 5374.95s]  You smell like Sour Patch Kids and cigarette butts. That would be so funny. I wish they would put that
[5374.95s -> 5383.37s]  in here. An absolute truth. Your breath is awful. It smells like you just opened up a tuna can
[5385.91s -> 5392.49s]  and put it inside of a dog shit bag. I hope you found something extraordinary.
[5393.45s -> 5417.69s]  You can now return to your realm. Okay. Damn. All right. That was cool. He's just frog.
[5420.86s -> 5429.03s]  Enjoying ourselves? Nope. This is quite a strange world. This realm has a way of
[5429.03s -> 5436.54s]  cutting right into the heart. It is natural it becomes this way for immortals. I like it for
[5436.54s -> 5445.21s]  what it is. I will be expecting many great things from you. It will get harder in ways
[5445.21s -> 5454.42s]  you might not be able to imagine. Voice is bad. Voice is bad. Shitty voice. Worst voice. Okay,
[5454.42s -> 5462.90s]  fine. I'll give you one that you like. But I shouldn't let you worry too much. You're ever
[5462.90s -> 5471.91s]  lost. Maybe talk to your blue friend. I bet they have a keen sense of direction.
[5471.99s -> 5476.95s]  Opposite ends of the spectrum for horrible. And not getting the good one. I know you want it to
[5476.95s -> 5484.36s]  be like, all right, if you're ever lost, maybe talk to your blue friend. I bet they have a keen
[5484.36s -> 5495.48s]  sense of direction. Now that would have been good, right? Hey, you fine piece of craftsmanship.
[5495.48s -> 5510.57s]  Want to swing by Midnight Town. The nicest place around. That was a perfect voice for a frog where
[5510.57s -> 5518.97s]  the world wasn't ready for it. Trust me, I know. All right, we've got a lot of places I can go.
[5518.97s -> 5523.43s]  Is this kind of like the Mega Man open world screen? Do I just pick a world and go?
[5523.43s -> 5553.03s]  Hey Red, instead of going back there, how about we go to Midnight Town? Cool. Time is only temporary.
[5553.03s -> 5567.82s]  True. What's this? Casino? What are we playing? Looking forward to playing. It's fun pretending
[5567.82s -> 5574.17s]  to be someone else. Oh, it's just, it's like D&D. I can't wait to get started. Hi there, Red. We can
[5574.17s -> 5580.79s]  finally start the game. Let's go. Certainly is out of my comfort zone, but I don't have anything else
[5580.79s -> 5590.41s]  to do. Sorry, well done, but I do like your company. Okay, Red, there's still room for one
[5590.41s -> 5598.95s]  more player if you want to join. I promise you it's going to be blast. All right. Yeah, let's play.
[5598.95s -> 5606.41s]  Wait, what's in here? The hatch is shut tight. You can't get it open. Seems we're all finally here.
[5606.41s -> 5622.25s]  Now, are you ready? Ready for an epic adventure? Yes. Good. Let me just set the mood. Let the
[5622.25s -> 5632.66s]  adventure begin. Once upon a time, in the land of Medallion, there was a village whose name had
[5632.66s -> 5640.01s]  been forgotten. The little town was settled with happy, hard-working villagers. But beyond the lake,
[5640.73s -> 5650.12s]  deep in the darkness, stood a tower so tall that it reached the clouds. The villagers could see
[5650.12s -> 5657.86s]  mysterious lights and shadows moving at the top of the tower, fearing that an evil wizard had
[5657.86s -> 5664.02s]  taken hold of the tower. The townspeople hoped for a hero to save them from their presumably ill
[5664.02s -> 5671.99s]  fate. Within the village was a temple that protected an ancient relic capable of withstanding evil.
[5677.02s -> 5688.79s]  Sword that deflects, Red attacks. Really? That's a really dumb name. I find it quite descriptive.
[5689.99s -> 5702.02s]  Guys, please don't interrupt. During a dark, rainy night, a warrior entered the temple.
[5702.50s -> 5720.17s]  Oh, great warrior, take this sword, our most valuable relic. Vanquish all the evil and save
[5720.17s -> 5737.90s]  our small village. Receive this sword and gain its powers of deflecting red attacks. With this power,
[5737.90s -> 5747.35s]  you might be able to face the evil wizard. Now before- what the fuck? Give me all your treasure
[5748.07s -> 5754.06s]  or pay with your lives. Oh, great warrior, we're helpless. Save us from this foul bandit.
[5754.14s -> 5795.58s]  I can deflect red, deflect his X, okay. Get out of town. You have bested me.
[5796.46s -> 5809.29s]  You saved us, oh great warrior. Hooray. Hooray. Hooray. Now make haste to the tower and defeat the
[5811.93s -> 5820.89s]  evil wizard. The warrior has a quest. Little did the warrior know what terrible challenges were
[5820.89s -> 5828.31s]  ahead. Seems like such a waste of time. We could be doing something more important, Red.
[5830.58s -> 5831.38s]  Mermaid man.
[5836.98s -> 5842.18s]  No, we need to get into the boat and go get them, SpongeBob.
[5842.18s -> 5845.93s]  What are you doing, you old moron?
[5847.11s -> 5856.26s]  I am trying to do what it is a superhero must be doing, getting to the bank.
[5856.26s -> 5860.38s]  We cast that check two days ago.
[5860.38s -> 5867.58s]  What? I have no idea what you're talking about. That wasn't SpongeBob, that was Barnacle Boy.
[5867.66s -> 5878.36s]  I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm glad you're the warrior, Red.
[5878.36s -> 5884.22s]  All right, get to the tower and fight. Yeah, that was Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
[5884.78s -> 5895.83s]  That wasn't SpongeBob. Oh, this is cool. I like this. Mood, yes.
[5910.14s -> 5920.02s]  Fake SpongeBob fans. So what, we're playing D&D right now? Is that what this is supposed to be?
[5920.82s -> 5926.18s]  Hey there, Red. Are you on your quest to slay the evil wizard? You see, that is also my quest.
[5926.74s -> 5932.02s]  That guy's terrorized these villagers too long. I see you got the sword that deflects Red attacks.
[5932.74s -> 5936.26s]  I'm not relying on any steel. My weapons are my fists.
[5937.06s -> 5940.86s]  Just out of curiosity, would you like to engage in some friendly sparring?
[5940.86s -> 5945.10s]  See which one of us is the strongest? Your sword versus my fists?
[5945.10s -> 5950.34s]  You want a surprising battle? All right, let's see who truly is the strongest.
[5950.34s -> 5957.74s]  Fucking cringe. What? Why did I just cringe?
[5960.46s -> 5998.26s]  Wait, why wasn't I ready? Shit, I could be hitting way more of these.
[5998.82s -> 6016.98s]  Like that, there we go. Yeah, you gotta string it together.
[6016.98s -> 6024.20s]  Cat, our streamer is bad. What? No, I'm not. I mean, I'm not great. I wouldn't say I'm very
[6024.20s -> 6030.07s]  good, good, but I think I'm okay. You got impressive moves. I have to practice harder
[6030.07s -> 6036.50s]  if I'm gonna beat the evil wizard before you. Let me handle it. I'm the one with the sword.
[6036.50s -> 6047.16s]  Oh no. Help me, Red. This game's too hard. I gotta attack my squirrels.
[6047.72s -> 6053.78s]  Would you help me? Thanks much. This time I will not fail.
[6053.78s -> 6065.78s]  Oh no, get up. Wow, those squirrels don't give up.
[6066.42s -> 6071.30s]  Would you help me up again? Thanks. This time I will not fail.
[6077.13s -> 6082.65s]  Wow, don't give up. Can I have you help me? Thanks. Thanks for helping me.
[6088.30s -> 6089.26s]  If he's dead, he's dead. Whatever.
[6089.90s -> 6096.10s]  Dear enter my domain. I have been commanded to not let a soul pass this bridge
[6096.10s -> 6102.12s]  if you are to cross. Prepare to pay with your life. Is this the wizard? No.
[6102.92s -> 6119.69s]  I think it's about to get serious. Boys and girls, it's about to get serious. What was that?
[6119.69s -> 6131.62s]  What the fuck is this? Oh, it takes out the whole row. That's good. No.
[6133.80s -> 6175.29s]  I like the song though. It's really chill. Shit. See ya.
[6178.50s -> 6185.29s]  Got some dank moves. Such great powers. I sure hope you're a good aligned character.
[6198.30s -> 6203.90s]  Warrior had proven their skills twice. Their confidence was high, which would be needed.
[6203.90s -> 6207.26s]  The swamp of chaos would challenge the warrior to their very core.
[6209.72s -> 6215.16s]  Swamp of chaos? Isn't a swamp level a bit cliche? What's next, the sewer level before the tower?
[6215.16s -> 6225.42s]  No. It's actually the badlands of chaos. You don't have to change the entire level because
[6225.42s -> 6229.74s]  of the zig. No, it's fine. I was obviously kidding that there was a swamp level. This is better.
[6231.18s -> 6260.87s]  The game's like glitching. Do you see that? What's this? Can I get rid of this stuff?
[6261.43s -> 6268.95s]  Honestly, the graphics in this level are very ugly. It really looks unfinished.
[6269.67s -> 6283.24s]  Well, that's what you get. Just saying you can make it better at the end of the game.
[6283.24s -> 6297.11s]  This is fart music. I gotta come forward in the chair. Here we go.
[6301.80s -> 6305.40s]  Stop hitting me. Only if you give me all your items.
[6306.20s -> 6312.17s]  Land, is that you? Did you see ya? This is my custom made mech character from Gears of
[6313.05s -> 6318.97s]  This fantasy game is way easier with a mech. I also noticed that attacking other players gives
[6318.97s -> 6325.19s]  me more loot. This must be breaking several game rules. I'll have to check the rule book.
[6326.23s -> 6328.79s]  Hold on, you don't play a good character, do you Red?
[6329.93s -> 6349.18s]  Oh, in that case, green and over all of your items will feel the wrath of the chaos six.
[6349.18s -> 6390.44s]  God, he's like scary looking. B. All right, get it together. Get it together. E.
[6403.74s -> 6435.64s]  Fuck. I'm going too far. This game is hard. I play a good guy. I lose. I play a bad guy. I lose.
[6435.64s -> 6443.94s]  Here we go. I found the rule about PvP combat. Oh, I guess you guys solved it already. It was
[6443.94s -> 6454.23s]  really not what we were concerned about. The show must go on little one. How am I supposed to win
[6454.23s -> 6460.15s]  when I keep losing? Muk keeps telling me failure is the progress that pays the world to success.
[6461.43s -> 6467.74s]  To me, failure just seems like failure. I guess you just have to think of another way to win the
[6467.74s -> 6475.86s]  game. I can't believe I was steamrolled by flan. I should really retire.
[6499.32s -> 6505.58s]  Don't skip. I didn't skip anything. Finally, at the foot of the tower,
[6505.58s -> 6511.29s]  the lair of the evil wizard. Will you be able to save the village from its ill fate?
[6511.29s -> 6518.46s]  It's actually becoming quite exciting. You can do it, Red. I guess if anyone has a chance to win,
[6518.46s -> 6533.70s]  it's you. If you defeat the evil wizard, we win the game. I'm the curse save point. There is a
[6533.70s -> 6539.46s]  50% chance that I'll delete your save. Lucky for you, you should have several save slots.
[6539.46s -> 6547.75s]  Do you take your chances? Oh my god. That actually scared me. Your save was deleted?
[6547.75s -> 6555.56s]  Okay. Holy shit, is that real? But seriously, your game was saved. Okay.
[6555.56s -> 6570.47s]  Scared me enough to do that. Got all this space back here. I'm assuming you're not going to use it?
[6571.35s -> 6615.34s]  Really? Okay. You have come a long way, warrior. I see that you are armed.
[6616.22s -> 6626.78s]  You are not the first they have sent to assassinate me. Isn't that right, Rasta beast?
[6626.78s -> 6630.22s]  The villagers just fear what they don't understand, you see.
[6631.77s -> 6636.57s]  Don't listen to that evil wizard, Red. Oh, shut up, Rasta. I don't have time for this
[6636.57s -> 6642.01s]  and you heroes are bothering me. Your death will serve as an example for anyone that would
[6642.01s -> 6654.04s]  even consider disturbing me. All right. This is the big one right here.
[6654.76s -> 6719.37s]  Oh, they're being blocked. You think you're fighting evil? You are so full of yourself.
[6722.74s -> 6747.24s]  I am the one who hears God. How are you so strong? I can't believe I was beaten by a wooden
[6747.24s -> 6761.27s]  doll wearing a metal bucket. One day I'll have my revenge. Lots of jump scares in this game.
[6761.27s -> 6764.47s]  Thank you for saving me, Red. I wouldn't have made it if it wasn't for you.
[6764.47s -> 6772.90s]  You fought valiantly. Let's go back to the village and tell them the good news.
[6772.90s -> 6783.96s]  You beat him too fast, you skipped verse two. Really? Oh, shit. Now that the quest has come
[6783.96s -> 6790.68s]  to an end, Red and Rasta beast journeyed back to the village, silhouetted by a glorious sunset.
[6794.28s -> 6803.80s]  No verse two. Really? Oh, sorry. Once returned, they were received as heroes for defeating the
[6803.80s -> 6813.10s]  evil wizard. Plant opened up a bakery where they sold slimy muffins, which proved to be quite a
[6813.10s -> 6822.84s]  success. Zig decided to make the tower their home, where Zig lived happily ever after,
[6822.84s -> 6832.49s]  or at least for a long time. And Nosferatu- Wait, you weren't in the game at all? I wanted to role
[6832.49s -> 6838.62s]  play as one of the mushrooms. Nosferatu continued the unfruitful quest of trying to learn the
[6838.62s -> 6855.50s]  secrets of their past. The end. Oh, that was fun. So what did you guys think? That was a good session,
[6855.50s -> 6862.36s]  green mage. Oh, I've played better. I enjoyed it, even if it was a bit hard. I guess this is it.
[6865.51s -> 6880.78s]  Actually, your great efforts of saving the land of Medallion, Red. Puzzle piece. Take this tributary
[6880.78s -> 6890.20s]  piece of wood as a reminder of this epic quest. Oh, wow. I'm sure it will come in handy. We picked
[6890.20s -> 6903.91s]  up a piece of a door. Door piece. Very cool. Oh, it's open. Hey, what are you doing? That's private.
[6904.47s -> 6916.14s]  The hatch is shut. You can't seem to get it open. What? Are you serious? For that just being one
[6916.14s -> 6923.56s]  little section of this area? That was pretty crazy. That was one little house. There's so much
[6923.56s -> 6940.47s]  more to do here. What's this? Oh, boy. I'm not doing that yet. Hi, dear. I feel that I am
[6940.47s -> 6961.50s]  destined to do great things in my life. I can go down. Who's out there? If anyone is out there,
[6961.50s -> 6966.54s]  it's kind of an emergency. Could you get some toilet paper? I'll reward you with a lava lamp
[6966.54s -> 6985.27s]  for your troubles. OK, toilet paper. What about the shop? These flowers smell like an old person's
[6985.27s -> 6998.74s]  breath. Like Sour Patch Kids and cigarettes. A rigidly locked chest. I smell like childhood.
[6998.74s -> 7012.84s]  I smell like barbecue. These flowers smell like paper. They smell like dirt. They smell like
[7012.84s -> 7023.27s]  skunky sweet. Wow. What is that clay pot you have? It would fit perfectly for something I had in
[7023.27s -> 7029.70s]  mind. I will give you something valuable in return. Could I have the clay pot? Yes.
[7033.69s -> 7044.28s]  This feels great. You can take my old hat. Trash can live. You seem interested in that chest.
[7044.92s -> 7049.72s]  Are you only Altem? Only the brown mage can unlock the golden lock, so I've heard.
[7054.52s -> 7069.16s]  I got a lid. What do I do with the lid now? Hi, small figure. I'm a stone guardian. Really like
[7069.16s -> 7078.22s]  eat, but I no move. Oh, you have food. Can I has cake? Yes. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum. Yum.
[7079.35s -> 7086.94s]  Delch. This was a bad cake. Thanks for nothing. What? What do you mean?
[7087.66s -> 7106.98s]  Pick up a hook. Do I have a hook? I have a trash can lid. A beautiful metal thing is that. I would
[7106.98s -> 7113.69s]  love to trade it. What do you want? Do you want to trade? Yes. Wow. I look so cool. Here, take this.
[7114.09s -> 7126.82s]  Um, this nice stick. I don't feel like it's a bad trade. Pick up a nice stick. Okay, stick,
[7126.82s -> 7141.83s]  trash can lid. Is there a trash somewhere? Oh, right here. I need a roof for my home. Maybe I
[7141.83s -> 7146.79s]  can give you some trash if you find me a roof. I do have some half used toilet paper if that would
[7146.79s -> 7154.18s]  be useful. Hey, that thing right there would be great. Perfect. I will trade you for the toilet
[7154.18s -> 7173.10s]  paper. Yes. Wait, you're not getting my toilet. I need it too. Haha. What? That's not fair. Ow,
[7173.10s -> 7247.21s]  my hand. Damn it. Oh, cool. I like this one. Damn. I think you get your that end, huh? That end?
[7247.21s -> 7254.31s]  Oh, what a bother. Fine. Take the toilet paper, but I'm keeping the roof. Got the toilet paper.
[7254.31s -> 7264.39s]  I need to be honest. You're really good at this game. You're crazy good at this game. Am I?
[7264.95s -> 7272.54s]  Can I find my calling? Who's out there? If anyone is out there, it's kind of an emergency. Yep,
[7272.54s -> 7282.38s]  I got toilet paper. Attach it to the hook and I will hoist it up. So what? You're going to
[7282.38s -> 7294.15s]  give me the key to the chest, right? Ah, yes. Finally, I can wipe my table clean. Is assholes
[7294.15s -> 7304.44s]  a table? Oh, right. I promised you something. A lava lamp, right? Oh, no, I've got bad news.
[7304.44s -> 7311.91s]  I seem to have lost it. If you bring me batteries, I promise to make something really, really unique
[7311.91s -> 7326.09s]  and special as a super promise. You dick. Bring me batteries. Well, batteries. Batteries in the
[7326.09s -> 7346.86s]  clock. I think I went everywhere I can here, right? I think that's it. Hold on. Wait, hold on.
[7346.86s -> 7360.23s]  Oh, the door is locked. What is that? All right. Well, I know I can go down. I can do it, Red.
[7360.23s -> 7370.87s]  My wife is 350 pounds. Please help me. I don't know. What do you want me to do about it? What
[7370.87s -> 7384.28s]  do you want me to do about it, man? Good luck with whatever you're doing. Okay. So I got that
[7384.28s -> 7393.13s]  was that door. We've been here. We've been here. Have I been? This is okay. We've been here. This
[7393.13s -> 7400.98s]  is the entrance, right? No, I don't want to leave yet. We've not gone in here. I hope you had a
[7400.98s -> 7418.07s]  great time. Want to go back dancing? Wait, what? I've gone in here. Knock on in here. How much do
[7418.07s -> 7428.87s]  I weigh? 100 and like 150 160. I just want to be someone. I wish I could leave this place someday.
[7428.87s -> 7447.91s]  I haven't felt happy in such a long time. 155. Um, I guess I can't do anything here.
[7454.60s -> 7483.19s]  Okay. What was that all about? Uh, you should do a golfing stream. I'm not gonna go golf. No,
[7483.19s -> 7490.70s]  I don't. I'm bad. I can drive, but I can't do anything else. I can drive and I can putt. That's
[7490.70s -> 7498.78s]  it. I would love to drive your ball for you. Wait till you chip it a million times and all the annoying
[7498.78s -> 7504.71s]  boring shit. So like I do the, I use the driver and I smash it. And then I just go in the golf
[7504.71s -> 7509.11s]  card and get to the green. I just drive to the green and wait for you. And you do all the shitty
[7509.11s -> 7515.59s]  boring golf suck stuff from the tee to the green. And then I take the putter and I putt. I do the
[7515.59s -> 7526.55s]  fun stuff. Just tell gold pig that you beat me up. If I can count on you saying the same. Yes.
[7526.55s -> 7531.96s]  You're a cool guy. All right. I've been, this is the first part, right? I was already here.
[7531.96s -> 7540.97s]  I remember doing this and I spit in the, like the one hour that I played this game a couple
[7540.97s -> 7550.41s]  weeks ago. I remember playing that part. This implies that I would let myself be within 200 feet
[7550.41s -> 7559.11s]  of you. I don't understand. What do you, what do you think? What do you think I'm going to do?
[7559.67s -> 7578.66s]  Like start biting you? Door's locked. Did I go in here? I think I already did. Yeah, didn't I?
[7579.22s -> 7584.68s]  This door seems broken. Oh, I have all the pieces to this door. All right. Let me save it.
[7584.68s -> 7592.74s]  He's rabid. I'm not gonna, why do people think that I'm going to like, I'm going to see you
[7593.38s -> 7598.97s]  first of all, how am I going to know who you are? If we're just like out in public somewhere and
[7598.97s -> 7603.45s]  we're just doing something, I'm going to know that you're a chatter in my chat. I'm, dude,
[7603.45s -> 7607.46s]  if we're just at the grocery store, we're at the grocery store. I'm not going to like ask everybody
[7607.46s -> 7611.62s]  in the grocery store if they're a watcher of the channel. First of all, how are you, how am I going
[7611.62s -> 7628.49s]  to know who you are from the smell? Okay. Are you sure you want to go in this door?
[7629.05s -> 7632.65s]  This journey is long and unforgiving. Do you still want to enter? Yes, of course I do.
[7637.74s -> 7662.98s]  And what, like, oh, hey, Jerma. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, just want to say. What, what is it?
[7665.14s -> 7671.54s]  I'm a big fan. And when I hear the N in fan, I just grab your fucking arm and start.
[7675.16s -> 7687.96s]  Why do you think that's going to happen? No, here's what's going to happen. Hey, Jerma.
[7691.70s -> 7695.70s]  Hey, I'm a big fan. Oh, hey, cool, man. Really good to see you.
[7696.52s -> 7702.58s]  You're a fan. That's awesome. That's so cool. Yeah, I, this is really fun. This is really cool.
[7702.58s -> 7707.53s]  I can't believe somebody recognized me in public. That's insane. Yeah, dude, can I get a selfie?
[7707.53s -> 7713.54s]  Of course you can. Of course you can. I'm going to need your credit card, though. And I got my
[7713.54s -> 7723.86s]  app here. It has tap. You can tap the phone. It's a little device I plug in. Yeah, sure,
[7723.86s -> 7742.65s]  absolutely. You got like a chip in your card, right? Yeah. And then he bites you after you pay.
[7743.37s -> 7752.33s]  No. Oh my God. Oh, thanks, man. Yeah, that was $50. Oh, here's a selfie.
[7761.48s -> 7766.20s]  I'm just a normal person, guys. I'm not like a rabid weirdo. If you come up to me and say,
[7766.20s -> 7769.48s]  Hey dude, how are you? I'm going to be like, Hey, what's up? It's really good to see you.
[7770.12s -> 7777.22s]  I'm not like a psycho. I'm not going to like, what are you talking about? Hey, red and blue.
[7777.22s -> 7780.58s]  The night is here. Sit down and relax. You still have a long walk ahead.
[7790.31s -> 7800.66s]  Please don't bite me. I don't want to turn into a germa. I've been meaning to tell you red.
[7801.38s -> 7806.02s]  This path will only lead to more torment. You have come this far. So I guess you've made up
[7806.02s -> 7812.14s]  your mind. I'm afraid this will lead to more questions than answers. I fear something
[7812.14s -> 7818.89s]  horrible might happen if you continue. Anyway, much has been said. It's time to hit the hay.
[7819.53s -> 7833.85s]  Good night. Is it like a bite of a vampire or a zombie? Um, I don't know. Probably,
[7834.41s -> 7840.62s]  probably a zombie. If I were to say that I don't have fangs and I don't like drink blood or
[7840.62s -> 7846.92s]  anything. So a zombie is just kind of a person's mouth and it's just kind of dirty with unbrushed
[7846.92s -> 7857.53s]  teeth. I mean, right? That's the only difference. A bit embarrassing. I don't remember why we are
[7857.53s -> 7868.89s]  here. What are we actually trying to do? I don't understand what we are doing. I feel like everyone
[7868.89s -> 7874.10s]  is speaking in riddles. There's no clear indication to what's actually going on. You really think we
[7874.10s -> 7882.46s]  should continue forward? I trust you. What is going on with this fire? Somebody's just breaking
[7882.46s -> 7886.38s]  styrofoam in the background. I can't even concentrate. I just hope you know what you're
[7886.38s -> 7906.95s]  doing. I just wanted to say that I trust you. Good night. Tap dancing. Yeah, somebody's practicing
[7906.95s -> 7925.69s]  above me in my apartment. That's not what fire sounds like. As good as a day can be, the road
[7925.69s -> 7934.81s]  is clear. Good luck. That's the hamburger helper burning in the oven. You don't put a hamburger
[7934.89s -> 7954.52s]  helper in the oven. In the oven. It's the sap that's being ignited by the wood.
[7957.80s -> 7962.41s]  All right. That's actually kind of interesting. I actually didn't know that. That's kind of cool.
[7963.05s -> 7985.22s]  Thanks for the tip. This is nice. This kind of reminds me of Outer Wilds at one planet. Enough,
[7985.22s -> 7992.62s]  buddy. Look, pal. I tried stopping you earlier, but you ignored it. I laughed and let it slide,
[7992.62s -> 7999.26s]  but now I've really got to put my foot down and tell you, go back and stay out and I won't hurt
[7999.26s -> 8014.71s]  you. Oh, I see. So be it. Get ready for a beating, fella. You gonna distract my lightning? I'm
[8014.71s -> 8024.46s]  serious. Go back. Come on, mate. What are you gonna be so stubborn? If you won't turn back,
[8024.46s -> 8035.91s]  I'll be forced to take you down. All right. You asked for it. I hate to do it. I'm gonna be real
[8035.91s -> 8041.38s]  sorry. I shall unleash my fury upon you like the thunder of a thousand lightning storms.
[8041.38s -> 8056.04s]  We got a big one coming up. A good song. What am I doing? Why would this work the second time?
[8056.04s -> 8064.12s]  All right. Hear me out. If Gold Pig asks, please just say that I fought valiantly, displayed great
[8064.12s -> 8073.29s]  acts of heroism and all that jazz. I won't waste any more of your time. I will. Don't worry. I will.
[8080.31s -> 8090.07s]  What's that? A car?
[8102.92s -> 8111.13s]  Hello? Broken car. There are batteries next to the engine. Do you want to pick up the- Yes, I do.
[8113.21s -> 8140.49s]  You picked up the batteries. He's mad. What's the car battle? Go back, turn around. I'm not going
[8140.49s -> 8145.93s]  all the way back that way. That's a 10 minute walk. I'm gonna get teleported to that hub world
[8145.93s -> 8179.64s]  anyways. Big gate stands ahead. Do you want to open the gate? Yes. What do we got? Oh, you walk
[8179.64s -> 8183.32s]  the entire way to the old desert temple and not many visitors come to these parts. It's good to
[8183.32s -> 8192.01s]  have multiple saves. Who knows what might happen? Nice. Good luck with whatever you're doing.
[8198.02s -> 8205.86s]  Look who finally stumbled in. You just won't give up. As much as I do. I must say I do.
[8205.86s -> 8214.26s]  Admiring. Chasing. Like this. At the edge of the mountain. Lucky for you, I have prepared a
[8214.26s -> 8228.49s]  welcoming party. Perfect. What I do. What I pay you to do. Hello, Red. I cannot let you continue down
[8228.49s -> 8241.82s]  this path. Leave now. I will kill you if you don't. I'm not a very good actor. I'm not a good actor.
[8252.65s -> 8255.61s]  Seems that you didn't understand what I meant when I told you to leave.
[8256.57s -> 8270.81s]  I regret disobeying my command. This is a Zumbini. I feel pain. I've resurrected you from the dead.
[8271.69s -> 8279.00s]  You are to follow my orders until I release you. What is it you ask of me? I want you to disable
[8279.00s -> 8293.50s]  the red one. I have something funny to- can't write as well. All right, let's get down to business.
[8294.22s -> 8300.30s]  You want to pass, Dolly? That ain't happening. Amigo, you heard what either mage said. I'ma
[8300.30s -> 8342.04s]  mess you up. Real bad. Can I still have the sword? Who made all the music for this? That's awesome.
[8343.00s -> 8396.25s]  It was Kevin MacLeod. It was not Kevin MacLeod. It's not Kevin MacLeod. It was. No, it was not
[8396.25s -> 8402.65s]  Kevin MacLeod. I'm guaranteeing that. Kevin MacLeod is a talented guy. He made a bunch of
[8402.65s -> 8410.06s]  great songs for all of us YouTubers. I don't think they had anything to do with this. It's
[8410.06s -> 8420.90s]  impossible. Purple, I can't do it. Yes, I see. I did not expect you to be victorious. I expected
[8420.90s -> 8429.05s]  you to die. I can't believe I was being used like that. This isn't the first time Purple put me in
[8429.05s -> 8437.91s]  a rotting corpse. I could at least have been for something important. Those mages, I don't like
[8437.91s -> 8462.06s]  them. I don't like them. I know your secret now. The tactic that lets you win. I found you.
[8463.26s -> 8468.94s]  I am Rob, former world champion. Raised from the dead. How to fulfill my deed with my bro Zomp.
[8469.74s -> 8475.34s]  But where is that guy? Ah, your green zombie friend there, down the hall.
[8476.22s -> 8481.90s]  Oh snap, that slacker knows we've got a job to do. Whoa, whoa, wait. Hold on there. I recognize
[8481.90s -> 8489.02s]  your voice. You're the one that summoned me. Oh, I see. You're part of the binding contract.
[8489.98s -> 8496.54s]  Seems I've summoned two entities, I guess. Sure seems like it, bro. This guy is loud.
[8497.26s -> 8505.67s]  What do you want me to do, boss? Well, since you're here. Yeah. If you defeat it, I will release you
[8505.67s -> 8512.65s]  from your bind. Okay, bro. It'll be a piece of cake. Hey, you're going to, yeah, I'm gonna, yeah.
[8516.41s -> 8522.73s]  Who's louder, me or them? It's definitely me. It's definitely me. I'm way fucking louder than
[8522.73s -> 8566.68s]  this guy. It's not me. It's not me. Holy shit. Oh God, it's distracting. You play good. No,
[8567.48s -> 8572.92s]  not sure I could take them down, bro. I didn't expect you to. I expected you to die.
[8573.72s -> 8583.54s]  Nothing has changed, Red. Hey, it's me again. I thought I would make things easier for you.
[8583.54s -> 8591.85s]  It's good to have multiple saves. Who knows what might happen? Do you want to save? Yes.
[8595.53s -> 8603.59s]  Nice. Good luck with whatever you're doing. All right. All right. All right. Okay. I don't,
[8603.59s -> 8614.97s]  whatever. Just look up on like the Wikipedia for this game what he said. Dude, my, hey,
[8614.97s -> 8619.05s]  my wife is 400 pounds. I don't care how heavy your wife is. I don't care how heavy you are.
[8619.05s -> 8625.69s]  I don't care. You're just prancing around in the same spot. I'm surprised you even got this far.
[8626.65s -> 8630.97s]  The dead may not be able to stop you. Living seem unable to do as well.
[8634.62s -> 8648.50s]  But I will not let you continue. We'll end your journey. This probably seems like a major boss
[8648.50s -> 8758.17s]  fighter. Oh boy. I can't get hit there. Why don't they play this kind of shit at the club? I would
[8758.17s -> 8787.96s]  go. It's getting quieter. This is freaking me out. They do. They do. They do this in Germany.
[8789.10s -> 8798.68s]  It's true. Hold on. Do I find that I like a certain genre of like German club music and I didn't even
[8798.68s -> 8808.74s]  know? Impressive. I won't be able to stop you. Understand that I did what I had to do. Let your
[8808.74s -> 8817.30s]  choices be merciful. It's literally just EDM. But is it like German EDM or is there a difference?
[8817.30s -> 8853.50s]  It's just standard. It's techno. You missed a door? I didn't. Oh, there is a door right here.
[8854.14s -> 8870.30s]  You're right. What kind of music do you hear at clubs? I don't know. What's this?
[8871.50s -> 8874.62s]  It's been a long time since we arrived in what some call Everhood.
[8875.66s -> 8880.22s]  So many years have passed that I've almost forgotten some of us were once humans.
[8880.22s -> 8885.59s]  So I thought I would write our history before time fades away. Time fades away our memories.
[8886.79s -> 8893.26s]  A long time ago, before we found the rift that would enable us to transport to this realm of
[8893.26s -> 8900.04s]  the immortals. When we were a society of millions and a small selection of us had the privilege to
[8900.04s -> 8905.64s]  belong to the almost at intestines, we had many debates on how to share this gift, this newfound
[8905.64s -> 8913.64s]  miracle. Should we open it for everyone or should only a few be allowed to visit such a place?
[8914.36s -> 8919.77s]  We decided it had been far too long that we had kept this gift to ourselves. In the end,
[8919.77s -> 8927.38s]  we determined we should allow everyone to meet the entities. The masses were elated. A great
[8927.38s -> 8932.33s]  majority decided to become immortals while only a few would remain as mortals, such as the old,
[8932.33s -> 8939.06s]  the sick, and unfortunate ones were the reasons of their own. You could experience the most
[8939.06s -> 8944.57s]  euphoric moments of your life then completely forgot they ever had happened over and over again.
[8944.57s -> 8950.18s]  I still have fond memories of using the earthquake machine during my dance-off battles with pink
[8950.18s -> 8976.15s]  mage. They were one of a kind and I truly miss them. Brown Mage. Okay, are we in the metaverse?
[8982.94s -> 8992.20s]  Go back, go to talk to Brown Mage. Can I get there from here? I don't think I can get all
[8992.20s -> 9008.50s]  the way back there. No, I know. I'm not listening to that one guy. This game's sick. This is a really
[9008.50s -> 9014.54s]  good game. I understand why everybody wanted me to finish it. It's very, very good. Very fun.
[9014.54s -> 9025.51s]  You need to do the Schrodinger's stream. What's Schrodinger's stream?
[9035.05s -> 9039.93s]  You're unbeatable after all. I assume now you feel entitled to have your arm.
[9040.73s -> 9045.59s]  I won't let you take it. That's why. You're going to have to take it for my cold,
[9045.59s -> 9081.21s]  dead hands. I will end you. Let's go. Final boss. Maybe. Watch it.
[9086.39s -> 9089.67s]  Easy. Get your tits out of the way, I can't see. You're blocking my view.
[9119.02s -> 9168.07s]  Through the fog. Why did I walk into that? You gotta keep the blood flowing. See what I mean?
[9181.53s -> 9227.74s]  Whoa. How do I dodge that? Oh. All right. Fight him. Shoot him. That's not it. I'm prepared.
[9235.19s -> 9237.27s]  Typical of you to dodge my attacks.
[9240.07s -> 9245.34s]  Why do you keep challenging Red when you know you always lose, Gold Pig? What do you mean?
[9246.46s -> 9251.54s]  Don't tell me you've forgotten. Seems you don't remember Red's other side, Blue.
[9251.94s -> 9261.10s]  Oh, always being a pawn in someone else's scheme, little gnome.
[9262.14s -> 9268.94s]  Gold has been using you all along to get his arm back. Wait, what? I, what?
[9269.82s -> 9276.22s]  Didn't know, or? Forgot. You scattle-brained twerp. I noticed you kept forgetting things.
[9277.58s -> 9280.78s]  It was just a matter of time before you turned completely useless.
[9281.90s -> 9285.34s]  That's why I took your legs. You don't need those.
[9286.60s -> 9298.44s]  My legs? You stole my legs? You stole Blue's legs? You let your greed control your actions again,
[9298.44s -> 9305.13s]  Gold Pig? Why would you even take Blue's legs? That's why they may be useful as toothpicks.
[9305.77s -> 9310.81s]  You give me my toothpicks back. Give me my legs. Give me back my legs.
[9312.65s -> 9317.21s]  You should return the legs. Blue is weak. They don't deserve to have anything.
[9318.76s -> 9333.66s]  Give back the legs, you hoarder. Fine. Fine. So I'm Red Mage, and that's Blue Mage,
[9333.66s -> 9337.82s]  and that's Green Mage, and that's Purple Mage. So we're all like, we all know each other.
[9337.82s -> 9350.20s]  We're all friends. Oh, I can finally walk again. I guess I don't need your help anymore.
[9351.32s -> 9360.55s]  Thanks for helping me. Now, where's Red's arm? I think you'd better spill the beans, Gold Pig.
[9361.19s -> 9366.97s]  These guys don't give up. Do what you want, right? Your precious little arm.
[9368.57s -> 9376.65s]  It is no use to try and hide it any longer. I keep it in the treasury. Go and get it and then buzz
[9376.65s -> 9396.38s]  off. It's gonna be a trap. They're gonna lock me in like a cell. I know it. There's a trap. It has
[9396.38s -> 9415.94s]  to be. Oh, look it. These are all our friends. We know these are all the friends we've made along
[9415.94s -> 9423.53s]  the way here. Remember the door? Remember the fish? Remember the goblin? Remember Dr. Robotnik?
[9423.53s -> 9431.54s]  Make a second save. Multiple saves. Hurry. Save. Save. Two saves. What? What? Why? Make a new save.
[9431.54s -> 9450.89s]  Why am I making a new save? Okay. Make a third save. I'm not doing two. I'm not. I'm doing two
[9450.89s -> 9471.11s]  saves. I'm not. I don't. No. Here's my arm. You want to pick up the arm. Leave you scram. Don't.
[9471.11s -> 9475.86s]  Are you sure? Yes. You picked up your arm.
[9491.18s -> 9508.01s]  What? It's not. This is bullshit. This is a fake end. Yeah, it's a fake ending. It's a fake ending.
[9508.97s -> 9526.41s]  I can smell it from a mile away. It's a fake ending. It seems as if the doll has finally
[9526.41s -> 9533.13s]  found its arm. You have proven yourself more than worthy to get your arm back.
[9534.20s -> 9541.64s]  Now that you have seen what remains of this world, the ones in this world are trapped here in this
[9541.64s -> 9552.42s]  realm. They have lived for many, many, many, many eons. Searching for a release for a purpose,
[9552.42s -> 9559.75s]  for a meaning. I just freaked out. People said their voice is bad. I must ask of you a huge
[9559.75s -> 9567.06s]  favor. Help free us from this eternal wandering. You must find extraordinary courage and determination
[9567.06s -> 9577.51s]  as this will be an immense challenge to end this world. We'll show you how to free souls with your
[9577.51s -> 9591.51s]  arm. Pair yourself. Human. Oh, this is a real boss. Oh, we got to lock in on this one. Listen
[9591.51s -> 9623.40s]  closely now. Reflect my attacks. Whoa. This is a whole new game. It's loud. So you got to get three
[9623.40s -> 9664.76s]  notes of the same color in a row. Shit. Oh, this makes it harder. This makes it really hard. You
[9664.76s -> 9676.02s]  just need two notes of the same color and now free souls. It's only two notes. Two then X to fire.
[9676.02s -> 9680.66s]  Oh shit. Okay. I thought I had to. All right. It'll be a challenging mission, but you do not stand
[9680.66s -> 9686.09s]  alone. You're the key, our champion, to free us from the shackles of immortality. Seek out the
[9686.09s -> 9711.80s]  spirits if you are in doubt. All right. Go. Am I about to go free these motherfuckers over here?
[9711.80s -> 9725.59s]  Interact or kill? What? You want to? Yeah. I want to save. What? Why would I kill the save point?
[9725.59s -> 9735.64s]  Great. Good luck. What if I, what if I kill this? What happens? I understand. Oh,
[9736.60s -> 9759.11s]  did I free them? Finally, you have your arm back. It's been such a long time. The mages have fled
[9759.11s -> 9764.84s]  for they know what is coming, but they don't understand why they must be killed. You must
[9764.84s -> 9770.23s]  help them by ending them. If you need help finding the remaining souls, we will be in our court.
[9770.23s -> 9784.95s]  Right now. So they're all running from me now. I'm going to head back to the cosmic hub. Wait,
[9784.95s -> 9804.81s]  I'm about to go on. I'm about to go kill everybody. I'm going to. Oh no. Don't kill the hub save point
[9804.81s -> 9810.17s]  for obvious reasons. All right. Well, let me go to like the circus, the carnival.
[9810.17s -> 9830.65s]  So wait a minute. What do you want to do? What's the point of learning new skills?
[9831.21s -> 9840.04s]  What do I, what do I do? Hey, what's with the attitude? What are you doing?
[9841.00s -> 9848.25s]  I thought we were going to have a dance off. I thought we were going to have a dance off.
[9848.25s -> 9852.89s]  I thought we were going to have like a dance off party thing. I don't want to kill everybody.
[9852.89s -> 9860.74s]  I thought it was like, oh, I can like grab the different colors and should fire it back.
[9860.74s -> 9872.38s]  What? I can just kill people? Hi there red. The cart race is closed. You, I have to?
[9872.38s -> 9881.83s]  I didn't want to kill that person. It's releasing them. You're freeing them.
[9885.78s -> 9896.07s]  I'm to stamp home. Goodbye. This feels bad. They're immortal. There's 28 more people. Wait,
[9896.07s -> 9913.24s]  I have to wipe everybody out? You can go pacifist if you want. I mean, what do I do?
[9914.36s -> 9919.00s]  Let's see what kind of wood you're made of. Oh shit. I can't just kill this guy. This guy's
[9919.00s -> 9966.58s]  fighting back. Of course. Right. When I changed from yellow to gray, can I just tap, tap, tap,
[9967.62s -> 9989.19s]  I'm going to try it. Watch this. Ready? You ready? Ready? Nope. That didn't work. I didn't do
[9989.19s -> 10035.96s]  anything. Wait, wait, I didn't kill them. Oh, not so easy to kill a vampire. Is it? Oh, I got it.
[10035.96s -> 10042.49s]  All right. I got you. It's, you got to do it before the song ends. This is awesome.
[10043.45s -> 10072.26s]  This game just got like five times cooler. Right now. It just did. Shit, you idiot. You idiot.
[10075.11s -> 10125.70s]  Can I block these? Oh, I can. I can. I didn't think I could block those.
[10126.82s -> 10163.29s]  You fucking idiot. Stop blocking. Get out of here. Oh, you hit hard for looking like a pair of sticks.
[10164.01s -> 10175.94s]  Before I go, let the world know. The world know what? I, Disco Jimmy, live to the fullest.
[10176.58s -> 10196.97s]  Time for me to perform my final disappearing act. Hey, no need to be so hostile. Let me just
[10196.97s -> 10204.74s]  go get a thing. What's he doing? Sucker. Wait, what? Is he hiding?
[10212.17s -> 10221.54s]  You don't have to kill them all. There are two routes you locked yourself after murdering the
[10221.54s -> 10226.18s]  save point. Oh shit. If you want to see this ending, you can keep going, but if you want to
[10226.18s -> 10232.54s]  change your mind, you can slow the save before you kill the lamp post. Shit. Well, we're already
[10232.54s -> 10239.34s]  doing this one. I'll do this one. I figured it was probably I didn't have to kill everybody,
[10240.14s -> 10263.72s]  but I mean, I want to see what happens. How do I get out of here? Oh wait, there's a sign in there.
[10263.72s -> 10277.16s]  Oh, there is a sign. You're right. I have to kill everything? Sign? Use magic eight ball. It will
[10277.16s -> 10284.76s]  help in your mission. What is your obsession with me? You are so cool for vandalizing a sign.
[10285.48s -> 10297.10s]  True rebel. 26. But what about the robot? The robot hid behind the booth.
[10301.11s -> 10318.15s]  I didn't I didn't kill the robot. Let me see. There's actually four endings. That's actually
[10318.15s -> 10334.55s]  that's cool. You stand still. The game will give you a guide and who you have to kill. Really?
[10334.55s -> 10357.30s]  Oh, it's a lie. Okay. Do the right thing and save them. Wait, that means I have to kill all the
[10357.30s -> 10365.40s]  mushrooms. I like the I like the mushrooms, but I'm not killing them. I'm freeing them from the
[10365.40s -> 10371.86s]  immortal world where we're all stuck here. Right? Is that just the narrative I'm putting in my head?
[10371.86s -> 10408.55s]  I kill this thing? Look, everyone's having a good time here. What about you? Can I? I'm the guardian
[10408.55s -> 10413.37s]  of the mushroom forest. Oh, yes. Here it is. The reaper of souls. I've been looking forward
[10413.37s -> 10418.86s]  to speaking with you. Have you come for my guidance or for my soul? Let me I'll get you.
[10418.86s -> 10424.89s]  You can say some words first. Put it simply. Life is suffering. The living fear death until
[10424.89s -> 10430.50s]  it's too late. That is how the mind works. But when life does not have a time span,
[10430.50s -> 10437.62s]  becoming immortal is more of a curse than a blessing. It is torture for the soul. There's
[10437.62s -> 10443.06s]  nothing to do with all of this time. After thousands of years, you become docile. You
[10443.06s -> 10448.90s]  become mute. There are so few things you can do in a physical form. It's almost like a cruel joke.
[10449.62s -> 10454.58s]  You must take great strides to realize what must be done. Do you understand what I'm what I'm saying?
[10455.14s -> 10465.78s]  Do you understand that I want to die? Um, yes. Good. Good. Do you have what it takes to finish
[10465.78s -> 10475.46s]  the quest? I don't know. Like maybe. No. Yes. The weight of the world is in your shoulders.
[10475.46s -> 10479.78s]  No one should be forced to bear such a burden. You're the only one that can end this torture.
[10480.66s -> 10502.54s]  Now, shall we battle? Yeah. Sure. Yes. Just like that.
[10502.54s -> 10595.13s]  That was tricky. Well done. You performed admirably. A true liberator, finally.
[10595.85s -> 10600.82s]  You will be received as a true champion when you reach the end. Farewell.
[10606.66s -> 10612.95s]  Everybody around here see that? They kind of look, they look kind of sad. Are you all right?
[10613.43s -> 10623.83s]  Wow. You found all of us. Oh, what a twist that you would be the one who had such power.
[10623.83s -> 10636.62s]  Life sure is full of surprises. So long for now. I don't want to get rid of them all. I like these
[10636.62s -> 10647.06s]  guys. I like this guy. I like this guy the most. I don't want to get rid of them. You found us. Yay.
[10648.34s -> 10661.88s]  It comes a time for us all. Oh, you have to free them. They're suffering. Death is temporary.
[10662.76s -> 10680.97s]  Life is eternal. There's nothing to be afraid of. Oh, God. He looks concerned. I don't think he...
[10685.75s -> 10707.13s]  Nothing to be afraid of. Don't miss the point of the whole thing. This is a musical thing.
[10707.13s -> 10709.21s]  We are supposed to dance, sing, and enjoy ourselves.
[10710.97s -> 10724.06s]  Hi. Hey, little guy. What are you doing? Nothing. Just coming over to say hi to you and check on
[10724.06s -> 10732.76s]  you and make sure you're doing okay. I'm doing good. I'm doing very good. Are you struggling?
[10732.76s -> 10749.21s]  Are you sure of your actions? You can't kill me in a way that matters. What the fuck, man?
[10749.21s -> 10760.17s]  It's not my... I'm freeing them from the immortal torture. Wait, the little worm guy. Get her alive.
[10760.17s -> 10765.62s]  For me, it doesn't matter. I can let you kill me without a battle. Or would you prefer a fight?
[10765.62s -> 10781.27s]  Do you want to battle? Yeah, I do. You're slaughtering everybody one by one.
[10782.76s -> 10863.27s]  Well, oh yeah. This guy does the weird shit. Shit. Hello, human. Oh, he won. No, he didn't.
[10863.91s -> 10890.63s]  I have green right now. Why is Dreamer so cracked at this game? I don't know. I just...
[10890.63s -> 10900.58s]  I told you. Give me four buttons and I win. That was fun. I admit defeat.
[10901.78s -> 10910.50s]  See you on the other side. Are you still on hard mode? Yeah. I haven't changed the difficulty or
[10910.50s -> 10919.85s]  anything. I have no idea what extreme would be like. All right. Is anybody still here?
[10920.41s -> 10939.86s]  Or did I free everybody? Is this somebody? The tree has a face. It said,
[10939.86s -> 10952.98s]  I think your brain might be just wired to be funky. The people in the lab. Oh, that's right.
[10952.98s -> 10974.04s]  Where was the lab? Isn't it up here? If you crank it up to extreme, it should be fine. It's not that
[10974.04s -> 10982.52s]  much harder, to be honest. Maybe... Once I learned you got your arm back, I reconfigured this entire
[10982.52s -> 10988.46s]  lab into an impenetrable death fortress. You're never going to catch me, bloodthirsty marauder.
[10988.46s -> 11006.52s]  Run down. Make sure to set all traps to full power. All right, you doofus. Oh,
[11022.66s -> 11053.96s]  just got to do it to the beat. That's it. No. Did you just turn it down? You fucked up. All right.
[11053.96s -> 11056.76s]  I'll turn it back up. It looked like it was too loud. I'm sorry. I'll turn it back up.
[11082.49s -> 11104.74s]  I'm fine. I need to go this way. I need to go over. I need to double. Where is it?
[11105.30s -> 11115.30s]  Yes! I'm fine. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[11117.40s -> 11121.00s]  I have to turn it down in my head. Oh, I have to do the whole thing again. God damn it.
[11122.04s -> 11149.56s]  God, I hate this. I just want to skip it. I hate trap stuff. I have no patience. This is getting
[11149.56s -> 11157.94s]  murdered. I don't... I don't... I can't do it. I'm going right down the middle. One, two, three, go.
[11158.90s -> 11182.18s]  I hate it. Okay, so I have to wait till it processes each other. One, two, go. My God,
[11182.18s -> 11186.82s]  don't even do this to me. All right, so I have to start at the bottom. Just walk with it. Just walk
[11186.82s -> 11205.08s]  with it. Just walk with it. All right, I made it. Oh, shit. What does this mean? Can I touch these?
[11208.82s -> 11224.31s]  Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. I'm fine. I can't believe it. How is it possible that you
[11224.31s -> 11238.90s]  got through all those traps? I command you to attack that red marauder. All right, we're ready
[11238.90s -> 11316.52s]  to kill. Oh, come on. God damn it. Come on. More volume. But that's a soul, right? 25. All right,
[11316.52s -> 11339.06s]  don't move. I'm just going to save the game. Go to extreme difficulty. I don't think I can... Can I?
[11339.06s -> 11344.52s]  Makes winning feel good, you will die. Less health regeneration for people who like hard challenges.
[11344.52s -> 11351.08s]  You think I can handle it? I'll try it this once. If I can't do it... If I'm not confident on this
[11351.08s -> 11360.95s]  doing it once or twice, then yeah, I'll try. I'll try extreme. Seems my luck has run out.
[11360.95s -> 11365.83s]  I don't blame you. I did try to eliminate you. There's no point in hiding myself from me now.
[11366.55s -> 11383.03s]  This inevitable death is upon me. I didn't even get a chance. He had two souls in his head.
[11383.03s -> 11389.75s]  You're orange. Started out as a minor inconvenience as it mostly does. For years and years and years
[11389.75s -> 11395.03s]  of endless enjoyment, our physical bodies were simply not keeping up with what our minds desired.
[11396.76s -> 11400.68s]  Not a sense of sickness or pain, none of that existed. But through sheer exhaustion,
[11401.40s -> 11408.12s]  our bodies from our primordial worlds would not adapt into the freedom of our new home.
[11408.12s -> 11412.70s]  This, of course, wasn't the case for every inhabitant. But as a former human, it certainly
[11412.70s -> 11419.91s]  was for me. You don't have to do this to yourself. Don't let chat peer pressure you. No, I know.
[11419.91s -> 11425.62s]  If it's too much for me, I'm just going right back to hard. And I will not care at all.
[11425.62s -> 11429.78s]  Sometimes games go from hard to extreme, and extreme is like impossible. So don't worry.
[11429.78s -> 11436.33s]  We usually found quick solutions such as potions, surgery, and artificial limbs.
[11436.89s -> 11441.08s]  But our demands grew more ambitious and we continued to evolve ourselves,
[11441.08s -> 11443.64s]  all in the name of making our existence as joyful as possible.
[11444.73s -> 11448.17s]  Our ways became twisted. We felt the urge to play pranks on each other,
[11448.17s -> 11452.90s]  throwing both friends and foes into pits of eternal hell, over and over just to experience
[11452.90s -> 11459.05s]  the days and months. In this insane indulgence, this cruel and twisted nightmare,
[11459.05s -> 11465.82s]  inhabitants started to disappear altogether. I suspect they found a way to end their immortality.
[11466.46s -> 11470.90s]  Brown mage. We're just like pranking each other by killing each other,
[11470.90s -> 11483.98s]  just to like know that time passed. That's kind of fucked up.
[11483.98s -> 11492.01s]  Oh, this person. What do you want to do? They're everywhere. What do they want? What do they want?
[11492.01s -> 11494.89s]  Leave me be. I don't want to. Make it stop. Make it stop. Make it stop. Make it stop.
[11495.53s -> 11522.39s]  What are you doing? What are you doing? I'm just, I'm freeing you. That was upsetting.
[11524.87s -> 11530.76s]  Back to the entrance. Yes. Build a save. I don't think the save points have a soul.
[11531.72s -> 11552.58s]  They don't. Okay. I think that's everybody in the forest. I believe that's everybody.
[11552.58s -> 11570.38s]  Interact with the ball. You shake the magic eight ball. It says,
[11570.38s -> 11575.58s]  Zig is relaxing in the dance club in a bad mood. Oh, it tells you where to go. Okay.
[11575.58s -> 11600.66s]  How the hell do I get out of here? How do I get out of here? I'm a save point and I have a soul.
[11600.66s -> 11609.18s]  How do I get out of here? Wait, what's that? You can open that door? Eventually?
[11609.18s -> 11629.08s]  Oh, get him out. Get me out of here. Use the door to the right of the lab.
[11629.08s -> 11647.98s]  Oh, I went the complete wrong way then. The spirits.
[11664.23s -> 11669.51s]  Why the fuck do you eat cauliflower with mustard? Why do you think I do that? Who told you I did
[11669.51s -> 11690.22s]  that? I don't, I don't, is there something wrong with that? They never were truly alive.
[11690.22s -> 11698.31s]  The mushrooms were never alive. There was the type of guy to watch
[11698.31s -> 11702.23s]  anime intro openings and complain that that's not what's put on the radio.
[11702.23s -> 11727.69s]  This door is locked. What's going on in here? And what's going on in here?
[11728.25s -> 11740.76s]  It's a vicious insult. I mean, is it an insult if it's not even real?
[11747.26s -> 11754.34s]  Okay. That's like you saying to me. Oh, German man. Like, God, imagine being the guy that likes
[11754.34s -> 11759.70s]  putting fucking call mustard on cauliflower. I've never eaten that before in my life. Right?
[11759.70s -> 11767.86s]  Like that doesn't insult me. I've never done that before. I don't like want anime intros on
[11767.86s -> 11773.11s]  the radio. Like, I mean, if that were on there, that'd be cool. Fine. But I don't like care.
[11773.11s -> 11785.29s]  All E flower. How do you say it? Good music, good people. I lived good.
[11785.85s -> 11801.00s]  Goodbye. What is that? What's this? Is it a wanted poster? Oh, it's a robot. Get him.
[11802.04s -> 11807.18s]  There's no escape. I always wondered if I was truly conscious. I might finally get some answers.
[11807.90s -> 11817.24s]  You want to fight, huh? You act tough, but I've never seen you throw any punches.
[11817.24s -> 11822.71s]  This time, I'll teach you a lesson. Yeah, turns out, turns out you didn't have a soul.
[11828.42s -> 11848.63s]  No soul in the robot. I know that's sad. Oh, this seems so easy by comparison to everything else.
[11864.15s -> 11919.94s]  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do. This song was awesome. Let's go. Phase two. Shit. Shit.
[11926.52s -> 11973.98s]  Fuck you. I expert. I can do it. I can do it. I can do it. It's easy. I can do it. Come on,
[11973.98s -> 12074.02s]  Gwen. Come on, Gwen. All right. You idiot. Can I touch it? I can. Oh, how are you so fast? Last
[12074.02s -> 12124.92s]  time. You got lucky. This time. Oh, you won't be so lucky. Oh, shit. I almost lost. I don't feel so
[12124.92s -> 12136.90s]  good. Expert makes them have more health and you don't have as much time. I mean, we'll do it for
[12136.90s -> 12151.94s]  a little while. Getting kind of creepy. Someone did the math on this game and the people living
[12151.94s -> 12172.15s]  in it. They've been living for 12 million years. God. Oh, what about this guy? Worked too much.
[12172.15s -> 12187.78s]  Should have done other things. Damn. I've had a great time. I've had a great time. I had a great
[12187.78s -> 12197.61s]  time. I had a great time. Does the ATM have a soul? That would be kind of funny. Do not harm the
[12197.61s -> 12246.44s]  automatic terror machine or it will harm you. Oh, shit. It does. I thought I could be sneaky. Oh,
[12246.44s -> 12301.74s]  I can't grab those. Come on, Gwen. Shoot it. Do not damage evil property. Ice over. It did have a
[12301.74s -> 12347.34s]  soul. I guess it did. Rabbit. Way to go. Way to go. No. Oh, what's going on? What the fuck?
[12351.78s -> 12392.20s]  What is it? I can't catch these. Speaking a different language? Yikes. Yikes. That's fucking
[12392.20s -> 12411.69s]  crazy. All right. Retry, right? I think I can do it. I can do it backwards. The text is backwards.
[12411.69s -> 12454.84s]  Last checkpoint. Try again. This one was wacky. I got to focus real hard here. Holy shit in my
[12454.84s -> 12468.22s]  fucking diaper. I was told to not say die forever again and I just did. I have more than one person.
[12468.22s -> 12499.96s]  I know. I got to roll over those. Oh, fuck you. I had it. Wow. It's impossible. No, it's not.
[12547.11s -> 12556.76s]  Damn it. It's so hard. I want to beat around the experts so bad. Same exact spot as last time.
[12556.76s -> 12562.54s]  Shit. Difficulty. I know. I know. All right. You need to jump and press the direction.
[12563.90s -> 12571.80s]  I know. I know. I know. There's a lot going on on the screen. There's all this candy shit
[12571.80s -> 12627.11s]  all over the screen. What's it doing? Oh, where are we going? Don't die. Don't go backwards on
[12627.11s -> 12645.66s]  me here, please. It's so hard to tell where the fucking thing is. Was I supposed to touch that?
[12645.66s -> 12734.98s]  I jumped over it. Shit. What are you doing? Oh, no. Do you have what it takes? Human? I don't know.
[12734.98s -> 12759.26s]  Oh, damn. Damn. That was close. Not required. You all right? You seem distressed. Hey, buddy.
[12759.26s -> 12776.17s]  Do you want to save? Yeah. I ran out of time. Like 15% health? No. No, what? You idiot. What happened?
[12776.17s -> 12784.41s]  That was your backup. My brother's two, three... All right. Start timing out the people.
[12784.49s -> 12790.38s]  Writing about how fat their family members are. Okay. I don't care. What did I just do? I saved
[12790.38s -> 12804.01s]  over the backup? We have been. Okay. All right. All right. All right. What happened? Did I blow it?
[12804.01s -> 12819.78s]  You saved over the one before you went into kill mode. Oh, that's all right. It's okay.
[12819.78s -> 12828.39s]  It's all right. That was wild. I thought I had it. I guess once the kind of neon colored ones,
[12828.39s -> 12833.43s]  once I can collect, once those started to come down, I didn't know I was supposed to kill.
[12833.91s -> 12845.21s]  Oh, I have to kill you. I'm glad I still remember you. Would I please tell you something? Sure.
[12845.93s -> 12850.74s]  You haven't said a word during the time we've known each other. You helped me even when I had
[12850.74s -> 12854.66s]  done something bad to you. Without you, I never would have made it to the Gold Pig's temple.
[12854.66s -> 12861.13s]  You helped Flan in that game. Even though they attacked you later, you helped Green Mage get
[12861.13s -> 12867.10s]  their eye back. Maybe it was all just to get your arm back. I don't know. It feels like there's
[12867.10s -> 12873.82s]  something bigger going on here. Maybe like an important cause? Do I have something to tell you?
[12875.00s -> 12879.90s]  Green Mage blocked the door to Midnight Town. There's a hidden entrance.
[12879.90s -> 12885.75s]  Green Mage told me to keep it hidden. I think Green Mage gave me this job because I would forget
[12885.75s -> 12897.53s]  where it was. It would remain hidden for everyone. I trust what you are doing, Red. I think I'm ready
[12897.53s -> 12911.64s]  now. Bye, old friend. May we see each other again. In the second eternity where we cannot die.
[12912.57s -> 12929.96s]  Immortality in heaven. Where the whole thing starts over again. I won't allow you to go any further.
[12929.96s -> 12935.93s]  Last time you had your arm, so many perished. If anyone else dies,
[12937.42s -> 12945.38s]  I just cannot stand by and watch it happen again. I'm gonna sneeze during this and I can't mute
[12945.38s -> 13033.96s]  because I'm playing. I'm ready. Oh, come on. Bullshit. Give me a break. I tapped it. What the
[13033.96s -> 13038.60s]  fuck are you talking about, bro? I was hitting X on the right spot. This is making me really mad.
[13173.53s -> 13191.50s]  Get the fuck out of here. God, that was hard. That was crazy. That's a severe
[13191.50s -> 13208.38s]  concentration. Whew. It wasn't enough. I can't believe Holly beat that for you. Shh, don't say
[13208.38s -> 13216.14s]  that. No, I'm gaming right now. All right, you can go. You can go in the other room. Thank you so
[13216.14s -> 13234.28s]  much. Yeah, thank you. I'll see you. All right, who's left in here? Good job, Holly. Come on.
[13234.92s -> 13251.69s]  Hey, what are you doing? You do have a pacifist save. It's the second file. Oh, that's right. It's
[13251.69s -> 13267.29s]  a little bit before the end of the game though, right? What about this guy? You're asking for
[13267.29s -> 13279.29s]  trouble? No trouble making in my shop. Actually get to go against the shopkeeper. Good luck on
[13279.29s -> 13290.57s]  this one. Oh man. All right, is this when we turn it down to hard? Find out. Oh, you can't grab those.
[13291.13s -> 13307.37s]  You can't grab those either. All right, I get it. I was trying to grab all those in the beginning.
[13307.93s -> 13350.14s]  You can only grab the orange ones. Oh, this is crazy. Okay, I'll give it a few more tries.
[13350.14s -> 13478.79s]  You got to just sneak in there and sneak out real quick. Come on. What? No. Oh my goodness.
[13478.79s -> 13486.87s]  Oh, yeah. All right. Okay. All right. All right. All right. We're going back to hard. That's insane.
[13486.87s -> 13497.24s]  Let's go. That's wild. Especially when your left is right, right is left. I don't know about that
[13497.24s -> 13516.15s]  one. Oh, did I training wheels myself though? We'll see. No, it's still pretty bad.
[13553.59s -> 13618.74s]  Shit. All right. Now we reset. Reset. Oh my God. You idiot. Oh man.
[13621.43s -> 13666.54s]  Give me something to throw at him. Shit. Going to be close.
[13675.10s -> 13680.15s]  That was probably the best song of the whole game. That was awesome.
[13684.36s -> 13706.01s]  Such a shame. Getting down to the final like 10. Getting a little weird. Oh, the chest. Can I still
[13706.01s -> 13719.72s]  open this? I don't want to kill the chest. I want to open it. Didn't say the brown mage had it.
[13719.88s -> 13735.40s]  This is getting pukey. All right. Here's the brown mage. What do you want? Kill. Who's making
[13735.40s -> 13761.69s]  that ruckus? Scram and get out of here. Bring me batteries. Oh, yes. Finally, I can power my
[13761.69s -> 13770.52s]  toilet. All right. I promise you. Here's a lava lamp. Oh, no. I seem to have lost it. Bring me
[13770.52s -> 13774.52s]  a trampoline. Then I can give you something. That's super promise. All right. Fuck this guy.
[13780.62s -> 13784.86s]  Forgive me for my thoughtless requests. I shall reward you greatly for your endeavors.
[13784.86s -> 13800.98s]  I will need you to open the secret entrance to my keep. Okay. Please be very discreet. The secret
[13800.98s -> 13806.18s]  entrance is located south of the pool of water. You'll find a pile of rocks and a door. I've
[13806.18s -> 13833.34s]  unlocked it for you. Okay. So I have to go down there? All right. Wait. What about down here?
[13833.34s -> 13863.86s]  Open it with my arm. Yes. You want to go in? Yes. What's all these tally marks? Oh, it's you. Hey
[13863.86s -> 13872.04s]  there. I'm a bit surprised that you broke into my cellar. I guess I shouldn't be. Now what is it
[13872.04s -> 13891.91s]  that you want? Go down first. Don't kill. Go down first. Did I go down first? Am I going to soft
[13891.91s -> 13905.70s]  lock myself out of something? Yes. Yeah. Go down first. Okay. Just wait that way. Just wait that
[13905.70s -> 13926.12s]  way. Okay. So go down from here. Okay. What the hell is this? Sign says turn on colorblind mode
[13926.12s -> 13945.24s]  in settings. I think I prefer it on, especially in battles. Really? I have to turn it on? You
[13945.24s -> 13958.66s]  don't have to. Oh, I thought it was required for this exact mission or something. Wait, this is him.
[13958.66s -> 13971.59s]  Dear Brown Mage, you never want to do anything lately. Just sit in your little hole and eat and
[13971.59s -> 13976.31s]  eat and eat. There isn't really anyone on my level and I'm bored out of my mind. I might give the
[13976.31s -> 13987.94s]  mushrooms a visit and yes, I'll be taking the ruby with me. Marine Mage, welcome friend. I sadly have
[13987.94s -> 13993.54s]  some bad news. I seem to have miscalculated my hypothesis. I need a very rare type of stick.
[13994.26s -> 13998.90s]  Unless you have a special type of stick. Wait, you do? Give it to me and I'll finish it.
[13999.46s -> 14010.30s]  Finally, I give you this as you have given me so much. The golden key. This key will unlock
[14010.30s -> 14035.22s]  secrets. I got a golden key. Okay. Is this person alive? A well-maintained porcelain toilet. Looks
[14035.22s -> 14044.73s]  expensive. Why are you acting so hostile? What do you want? Wait. Oh no. I've been tricked. It's
[14045.29s -> 14053.30s]  you. Even after everything I've done for you. We don't fight him. He just, oh shit, we didn't
[14053.30s -> 14070.44s]  even get a, you don't go, you don't get a cool song apparently. Oh shit, okay. All right, let's
[14070.44s -> 14091.45s]  go to the chest and then I want to open that other door too with the gold lock. Save the game first.
[14091.45s -> 14117.24s]  Save, save, save, save, save, save. All right, chest. What do you want to do? Interact. You want
[14117.24s -> 14136.18s]  to use the key? Yes. Something powerful seems to resonate with the golden key. Are you sure? Yes.
[14136.18s -> 14145.21s]  All right. Who is it? Dr. Manhattan? Who's in here?
[14186.73s -> 14190.73s]  Holy shit. That gets a little, okay, that got a little crazy.
[14190.73s -> 14203.30s]  Why is my pee green? I don't know. Go to a doctor. That's a question for a doctor, not me.
[14251.16s -> 14252.12s]  What?
[14295.99s -> 14316.25s]  I can grab those? I thought I couldn't. I thought I couldn't grab those. I thought I
[14316.25s -> 14319.45s]  couldn't grab those. I thought I couldn't. I can't. I can grab those. I thought I couldn't.
[14321.18s -> 14323.34s]  Oh, I didn't know I could grab those. I thought I could jump over them.
[14323.50s -> 14368.46s]  I can grab them. Shit. I'm an idiot. Oh man. All right. Gamer Fatigue is sitting in. Gamer Fatigue
[14368.46s -> 14386.74s]  is sitting in I think. Let me drink some water. Gamer Fatigue is sitting in. I'm ready. This is
[14386.74s -> 14391.99s]  one of the hardest battles in the game. I'll get it. It might take me a few more. I got to get
[14391.99s -> 14514.38s]  through the Gamer Fatigue and I'll be fine. We're good. God damn it. Motherfucker, that lasts so
[14514.38s -> 14531.98s]  long. His brain's overheating. Oh, it is. Oh, I was close. 30%. You ever shower with your socks on?
[14532.62s -> 14540.20s]  No, I don't. All right. All right. It's all about you got to move to the edges of the screen.
[14540.76s -> 14593.77s]  You can't panic. My nose is burning. Okay. Oh my God. All right. I'm out. I'm out. No, I'm out.
[14593.77s -> 14612.60s]  I can't leave. I'm stuck here forever. I think I'm stuck here forever. We'll forgive you if
[14612.60s -> 14619.16s]  you lower the difficulty. I think I can do it. I think my brain's starting to get a little
[14619.16s -> 14703.03s]  fried from the game though, to be honest. I think we're frying out.
[14706.71s -> 14742.10s]  Fuck you. Same exact spot as last time. Same spot as last time. I'm so close though. I can
[14742.10s -> 14749.54s]  feel it. I got him to 25% health. I just got to get through that section and I got this shit.
[14749.54s -> 14756.71s]  That section is the worst part. If he goes back to the first verse again, oh, it's over. I'll get
[14756.71s -> 14774.74s]  him. I'll get him. Take a break. Take a break. All right. We'll take a break for a second. Deep
[14774.74s -> 14789.22s]  breathing. Let's go. All right. So when he does the second part of that chorus, everything comes
[14789.22s -> 14797.80s]  down. There's two blips where you're safe and you have to collect them both and fire it back.
[14797.88s -> 14805.05s]  Everything else is full. Shower with some socks on and eat cauliflower and mustard.
[14805.05s -> 14809.75s]  You can just dodge it and do the fight later. Yeah, but I want to kill this motherfucker.
[14812.12s -> 14888.74s]  Okay. I'm ready. One more attempt and I'm going to go pee.
[14945.74s -> 14955.26s]  Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Quiet. Everybody quiet. I'm in the same spot.
[14955.26s -> 14967.30s]  It happened the exact same spot again. Okay. We're not upset about anything. We're just
[14967.30s -> 14973.00s]  exclaiming the fact that I need to probably move to the left side. I'll move to the left side
[14973.00s -> 14979.40s]  instead of the right side. It's mirroring the pattern. I know. I know. Tasmanian devil.
[14984.20s -> 14990.58s]  Hold on. Did that actually sound like the Tasmanian devil? Oh my God. Let me see. Let me hear it.
[14990.58s -> 15005.58s]  It's okay to be upset. I know. Oh man. It's the same spot. Oh shit. It keeps happening in
[15005.58s -> 15017.90s]  the same location. I got to move to the left side. You're going to piss yourself? Oh, I'm good. I'm
[15017.90s -> 15040.34s]  good. You can hear it. Okay. You want to know what happened? So right here, I can pinpoint
[15040.34s -> 15045.14s]  you the exact place where my brain decided to try to switch this from anger to like,
[15045.54s -> 15053.32s]  this is a funny voice, right? Right there. Because then I go like, I'm trying to look at this is a
[15053.32s -> 15062.71s]  funny voice now. Like that was me. That was my brain desperately trying to make you guys
[15062.71s -> 15070.49s]  think that that was like, oh, a funny voice I was doing. I realized that I was screaming and I had
[15070.49s -> 15074.65s]  to like in the middle of the scream, turn it into like a little funny. Oh, what a joke he's making.
[15077.72s -> 15086.15s]  Larry David. I'm not fucking going anywhere. This is the one right here. Halfway through that,
[15086.79s -> 15096.52s]  I was like, oh, I'm a comedian. Shut up and get it right. This is it. This is the one. This is
[15096.52s -> 15161.21s]  actually the one right now. I'm not fucking, I'm not going to get hit once. My face is so itchy.
[15161.21s -> 15171.16s]  My face is so itchy. It's ruining everything. Oh God damn it. Why does it itch? Why? Whatever.
[15172.38s -> 15256.58s]  I'm fucked. Yeah, I didn't beat him. Oh man. I'm finally free from the shackles. I hope to see you
[15256.58s -> 15276.70s]  soon. Goodbye to this wretched world. No. No. No. I failed the DPS check. Reload the save.
[15284.38s -> 15292.86s]  You can find them again. Oh, I can fight them again. Okay. Shit, that was crazy. What do I
[15292.86s -> 15297.90s]  want to do? What is it? Gems of power and soul bound gems, sometimes known as the fruits of the
[15297.90s -> 15309.38s]  gods. Okay. There are different gems in this world. Many are already known, but it's likely
[15309.38s -> 15313.38s]  there are still just as many waiting to be discovered. It truly harnessed the gem's full
[15313.38s -> 15317.06s]  potential. It just needs to fuse the gem with their body and soul. These are known as soul
[15317.06s -> 15328.65s]  binding gems. One should be cautious of soul binding gems as they have a tendency to change
[15328.65s -> 15334.26s]  the very nature of the ego once they are truly connected. In essence, it's very unnatural.
[15334.26s -> 15341.27s]  The melding process is known to be quite painful. For a gem to become a soul bound gem,
[15341.27s -> 15350.79s]  it needs to replace at least one of the five senses. I hate that. I keep thinking about how
[15350.79s -> 15356.46s]  much I hated how I said that. One or more need to be sacrificed so the gem can be truly activated.
[15356.86s -> 15394.73s]  Especially considering it was like it happened in a sheshma. I hate it. I hate that sound. Oh,
[15394.73s -> 15398.97s]  right. Hey, you think you're tough coming in here and making a ruckus? I'll show you ruckus.
[15403.16s -> 15406.12s]  Oh, all right. We'll take a break after this. We'll go pee and I'll come back.
[15406.12s -> 15422.22s]  Crash can time. Stop farming 2022 awards. I'm not. I promise. All right. Relax, dude. Come on.
[15424.52s -> 15471.34s]  Not you, me. This is night and day compared to the last one. Good block. Holy shit. What are you
[15471.34s -> 15487.38s]  doing, man? I'm just completely jinxed at you. Not even my shell can protect me from you. We've
[15487.38s -> 15501.99s]  had a long time for this. 13. All right. I'll go pee. I will see you guys in two minutes. I'm
[15501.99s -> 15505.03s]  going to go pee. I'm going to grab a little bit more water. I'm going to shake around a little bit
[15506.62s -> 15510.30s]  my brain in the right place to do the rest of the game, which I'm assuming that we probably
[15510.30s -> 15732.07s]  are getting near the end here. I'll be right back. Okay, guys, somebody wants to say something.
[15732.71s -> 15740.89s]  They're a little groggy. They've been sleeping for a while. They don't want to be on camera.
[15741.53s -> 15762.15s]  Are you doing, Cheeto? Okay. Okay. Yeah, you're a little groggy. Tired. Do you want some coffee
[15762.15s -> 15773.29s]  or something? You've been asleep for like two years. Do you want anything? Okay. That's a very,
[15773.29s -> 15785.74s]  that's pretty big Burger King order. You want to, you want to shake? Okay. Chocolate? Okay.
[15786.30s -> 15797.54s]  You want me to put you back on the shelf? Okay. Back on the shelf. He's not ready for the camera
[15797.54s -> 15801.38s]  yet. He's a little tired. He was asleep for a couple of years. He doesn't want to be on camera.
[15802.02s -> 15813.53s]  The large Burger King order, McDonald's, whatever he wants. He's just waking up. It takes like a few
[15813.53s -> 15836.71s]  days to wake up. All right, let's go. We're going to do a Burger King Cheeto stream. All right,
[15836.71s -> 15852.30s]  who do we got left? I already did this stuff. What's Cheeto's order? So Cheeto really only
[15852.30s -> 15860.09s]  eats a very, very little. So Cheeto likes nuggets. So what ends up happening is he eats one nugget,
[15860.09s -> 15865.90s]  like the half of one nugget takes him like 45 minutes or so. He kind of nibbles at it. And
[15865.90s -> 15878.46s]  then I just eat the rest. Blue slime is working hard in the cursed castle. I opened this. Ow!
[15879.43s -> 15886.01s]  Thank you for removing the lock. Green mage locked me up to keep you away, I guess. Oh wait,
[15886.01s -> 15890.09s]  wasn't green mage like down in the thing? Yeah, hold on. Let's go get green mage. He was down.
[15890.09s -> 15919.85s]  Where was he? All right, let's go get him. Hi, green mage. Time to go. From this point forward,
[15919.85s -> 15930.97s]  I need 12 more souls. How much time do I think I got left in the game? This is where it ends.
[15930.97s -> 15939.53s]  After spending an eternity in mushroom forest. How anticlimactic. Maybe like an hour or two? All
[15939.53s -> 15962.94s]  right, cool. An absolute max of maybe two hours. Okay. All right, green. Let's go. I don't know,
[15962.94s -> 15984.06s]  I can catch these. Wait, stop. You're serious? Hear me out. If you want a true clash of life
[15984.06s -> 15997.82s]  and death, you'll have to spice it up. Come into my playroom. I wouldn't go in there if I were you.
[15997.82s -> 16002.54s]  That corridor is endless. Well, technically it isn't endless. There's an end. It'll just take
[16002.54s -> 16027.45s]  forever to get there. I know because I made the corridor. Hi, buddy. Main reason why I gave the
[16027.45s -> 16033.53s]  ruby to you is to have them separated. Together they are too powerful in wrong hands. The emerald
[16033.53s -> 16039.54s]  is locked inside an indestructible chest stored with an acquaintance of mine. For your own sake,
[16039.54s -> 16048.68s]  I won't tell you where the aquamarine is located. Take care of yourself, green. It takes four hours
[16048.68s -> 16052.76s]  to go down the hallway and there's shit in the hallway so you can't just tape a button down.
[16053.64s -> 16061.98s]  Are you kidding me? Welcome to my real playroom. Only a special few know of its existence.
[16062.54s -> 16065.74s]  Let us not delay the inevitable. Or are you too scared you might lose?
[16066.54s -> 16068.30s]  All right, it's time for you to die, motherfucker. Let's go.
[16072.44s -> 16082.04s]  Somebody said Forsen watched Shrek during the walk. Wait, are you serious? Hold on. Really?
[16082.04s -> 16103.43s]  That's fucking hilarious. Oh, that's amazing. I was there. I haven't felt this alive in a long
[16103.43s -> 16155.37s]  time. Let's go. It'll be the greatest duel ever. I can't pick those up. I'm trying to grab those
[16155.37s -> 16163.29s]  and it's too much. All right, sit up. I'm too busy trying to grab those ones and I just avoid them.
[16199.29s -> 16205.38s]  What am I doing wrong here? This is not that hard. I'm just overthinking it now.
[16206.38s -> 16212.78s]  The last insane electricity man. I need to put my brain back where it was.
[16265.80s -> 16319.96s]  Oh, fuck off. Can I catch those? What the fuck? Oh my god, you're killing me here.
[16320.68s -> 16355.61s]  I can't grab anything. Oh, shit. No, I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.
[16356.17s -> 16390.84s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me. Oh my god, you're gonna be kidding me. Pity loop? That's fine.
[16390.84s -> 16425.29s]  I got pity looped. It's all right. I'll take it. We'll do the two. I know 11. What characters
[16425.29s -> 16470.95s]  were even left? I'm not doing the hallway. I'm not doing that. No, that song was awesome.
[16470.95s -> 16487.08s]  That was a really good one. A blue slime in the castle. It's only four hours. That's four hours
[16487.08s -> 16512.79s]  too long. I think everybody's dead here. So this way is locked. Favorite type of cheese,
[16512.79s -> 16523.27s]  probably Swiss or some kind of cheddar probably. Where should I go? These people are in here,
[16523.27s -> 16533.67s]  right? The ghost people? What do you want? I bet what you heard from the forest spirit was not
[16533.67s -> 16557.22s]  what you wanted to hear. What are you doing? Oh, again? Oh, whoa. What? The blue slime is
[16557.22s -> 16575.35s]  working hard in the cursed castle. My work is not done. Still, I've had my revenge. You must kill
[16575.35s -> 16579.91s]  everyone from this immortal world before we allow you to continue. You have 11 souls to liberate.
[16582.36s -> 16589.64s]  Cannot kill what is already dead. You must kill everyone before we can close this realm.
[16592.65s -> 16597.05s]  I can give you something that will help you. Help you find the souls. Some might say the extra help
[16597.05s -> 16602.92s]  isn't necessary, but I say take all the help you can get. Do you want it? Yeah. This lantern,
[16602.92s -> 16616.20s]  it will help you find souls. I want to go away, but I can't seem to let go. What do you want?
[16617.16s -> 16621.53s]  Wait, what? The beast within the cursed castle protects a spirit.
[16621.53s -> 16628.98s]  Get the lantern. If you stand still, a guide will show you where the souls are. Oh,
[16628.98s -> 16637.19s]  this is what they were talking about. That person said that. Ah, all right. Cool. No help. No help.
[16637.19s -> 16675.46s]  No help. Where are you at? How does that make any sense? Why are you telling me to do that?
[16675.46s -> 16702.41s]  Nice GPS. Come here. Why does it run away every time? Annoying. Yeah, there's the night guide.
[16702.41s -> 16707.94s]  There's people in the castle too. God, our differences. Both of us had our own goals.
[16708.50s -> 16712.34s]  Me trying to stop you, you walking all over me and not showing any sympathy.
[16712.34s -> 16717.62s]  Hurt my feelings. It hurt my finances. Right now, my friend, I understand that you're on some kind
[16717.62s -> 16725.66s]  of killing spree. You can't just let that slide, you know. All right, dude, let's go.
[16745.85s -> 16805.40s]  Match the colors. Huh? Please, can you stop? If I bother. The guy looks like German when he's
[16805.40s -> 16819.70s]  streaming. That's true. You sure are a tough guy, you little red twerp. There are 10 souls remaining.
[16819.70s -> 16846.89s]  We're gonna find them all. He's as naked as ever. Oh, we have to ride this back.
[16846.89s -> 16860.14s]  Probably shoot. What the fuck? There's somebody here. I didn't know that was okay.
[16860.78s -> 16872.71s]  There's somebody actually on the train. I can't really read what they're saying.
[16899.90s -> 16925.19s]  This is gonna hurt. This is gonna hurt. Yeah. Nine. I guess my days end here. Nobody else to
[16925.19s -> 16942.57s]  move the car. It's the only character with a damage animation. There's no music now. This
[16942.57s -> 16973.59s]  is weird. Who's next? I had a nap midstream. Why is he killing everyone? You're gonna have to go
[16973.59s -> 16984.09s]  back and see what happened. Oh no, not these. You ain't going nowhere. Against both at the same time.
[16985.93s -> 16990.97s]  Let's get him, Job. They both have such painful sound effects for noises.
[16995.72s -> 17008.06s]  He's gonna be screaming the whole time. It's gonna be so annoying. Oh, they have different health bars.
[17008.70s -> 17067.59s]  Oh god, that's too many sounds. Oh, the beat. I can't focus. I'm almost dead. It's too powerful.
[17068.47s -> 17110.10s]  Now what? Impossible. So he said, I don't get this combat system at all, but it looks fun.
[17110.90s -> 17116.66s]  So the first half of the game, you do not have a combat. You don't have a laser beam that I'm
[17116.66s -> 17121.70s]  shooting out. You essentially, well, I'll let you figure it out. It's a fun game. It's good.
[17123.69s -> 17147.22s]  Found a loophole in our contract. Kevin McCloud. A two? Yeah, down to seven. Oh no, I don't want
[17147.22s -> 17160.68s]  to kill these guys. I like these guys. Hey there, pal. Oh, you seem to have found your arm. Great
[17160.68s -> 17178.87s]  news. I like these guys. Hey buddy, great to see you again. You can't come here and cause a ruckus.
[17178.87s -> 17184.34s]  I don't like the vibes you're putting out, man. What does she teach you a thing or two about bad
[17184.34s -> 17190.17s]  behavior? You think that qualifies us to help, Buck? You got it right, Plant. We won't go easy
[17190.17s -> 17242.94s]  on you, kid. I really like these guys. I don't want to kill these guys. That was cool. He's cool.
[17242.94s -> 17264.89s]  Oh shit. Oh, he's pissed. What happened? What the fuck? I should have killed the turtle. I should
[17264.89s -> 17335.14s]  have killed the turtle first. It's Ornstein and Smog. Oi, oi. That is phase three. I got pity
[17335.14s -> 17355.29s]  looped again. No, I didn't. You horrible creature. I hate you. Down to five, right? Okay. Everyone,
[17355.29s -> 17399.00s]  they certified me. I feel bad. Okay. Somebody in here? They are in here. Oh, this shit. I remember
[17399.00s -> 17426.58s]  this. I got to go down. Just kidding. Up. I remember it. Do you want to stop killing? I don't know. I
[17426.58s -> 17442.38s]  feel like I'm doing the mission. I'm on the mission. No. I admire your determination, but I can't stay
[17442.38s -> 17448.04s]  in the choices you're making. I can't be part of this murderous crusade. One of your quests
[17448.04s -> 17541.91s]  must end now. Faster hand? All right. This game is crazy. Ooh, I like it. Okay, let's go. Damn.
[17544.49s -> 17592.44s]  Oh, my colors are blending together in my brain. Shit, I don't think I beat him. Jesus. I barely
[17592.44s -> 17600.42s]  got the loop. Come on. I want to see the heart rate. You should have seen the heart rate on
[17600.42s -> 17610.33s]  the magical lightning guy. Boy, the hand didn't have a soul, though. Oh, my God. What are you
[17610.33s -> 17636.02s]  doing? It was probably really high. All right. We'll lock doors. This is the beginning of the game.
[17636.02s -> 17641.06s]  I am free again, thanks to you. The mage has locked me up. Purple mage is in the room with
[17641.06s -> 17659.94s]  the mirror of truth. We trust in you to finish the deed. Who's in here? Wait, what? Oh, right.
[17659.94s -> 17685.70s]  What is that? Going to the theater? You killed the cursor. That's your hand now. Oh, okay. Oh,
[17685.70s -> 17697.59s]  the maze. The spider. That's right. Okay. Wait, why does it want me to go up here? Where was that
[17697.59s -> 17729.29s]  spider? Hold on. Let me go to the theater. Somebody in the theater. Who's in the theater?
[17729.85s -> 17761.67s]  It's a 50% chance every time you walk in. Where is he? Either you were lying to me or these are
[17761.67s -> 17775.91s]  some really stupid ridiculous odds. All right. Where's the spider, though? I want to do spider
[17775.91s -> 17797.48s]  first. There's still several people in the castle. Castle near the slime brothers. I'll just go back
[17797.48s -> 17811.99s]  down. You're insanely stupid sometimes. How? Because I didn't know that it was, I don't have
[17811.99s -> 17832.81s]  a Wikipedia open about how to trigger the event to happen. Oh, you. You're alive. You find pink
[17832.81s -> 17841.61s]  spirits and old saying says not to trust them. It'd be quite mischievous. I guess this is as
[17841.61s -> 17857.40s]  good as any place to die. It's cold and comfortable. What would you like to die for? What does that
[17857.40s -> 17891.53s]  sound? What if I can't? Do I play by myself? Sounds killing me. What is this? I don't.
[17909.62s -> 17929.18s]  Okay. Congratulations. There was a type of person to say please to his Alexa. Sure. Find the spider.
[17929.74s -> 17955.70s]  I'm here. Where are you? Where are you? Let's go. Favorite album of all time. Probably Demon
[17955.70s -> 17978.39s]  Days or Plastic Beach. I like them both equally. No, wait. Oh, right. I have to avoid those.
[17982.09s -> 17996.73s]  Right. That's going to be a pain in the ass. Okay. Avoid everything. Just avoid everything.
[18038.68s -> 18062.46s]  You stupid idiot. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. I couldn't press
[18062.46s -> 18065.90s]  it before and now you can't avoid it. No. Well, I. All right. No, no, no. Start over. Start over.
[18065.90s -> 18113.26s]  Let's just do this right. Shit. Dude, I'm slowing down hard. I feel like I've been looking at a
[18113.26s -> 18192.74s]  kaleidoscope for five straight hours. Oh my God. Sensory. Oh, stop. I'm turning it down. Oh my
[18192.74s -> 18214.63s]  goodness, dude. Come on. That was unbearable. Okay. Peace returning to the immortal realm.
[18214.71s -> 18284.18s]  Follow the pink. I was thinking about it. Up. We're here. Up. Whoa. What is this? Two, two, two.
[18284.90s -> 18300.34s]  Two, two, two. What do you want? Hello, red. Keep following the candy canes and you will arrive
[18300.34s -> 18342.01s]  at bubble gum land. You sure pack a punch. Okay. It's a long way. It's going to be a pain in the
[18342.01s -> 18353.93s]  ass to go back. Vampire guy said don't trust pink spirits. I'm not trusting them. I'm about
[18353.93s -> 18401.85s]  to kill them. Come here. Trust them. I'm here to murder them. How long is this? What the fuck?
[18401.85s -> 18424.95s]  Am I going to have to put on Shrek while I do this? Something's not right. I don't know what
[18424.95s -> 18461.74s]  it is. Something's not right. Something's not right. Oh, please. You just have to walk backwards.
[18461.74s -> 18476.98s]  Welcome to bubble gum land. Relax and rest. If I do a job badly, then you can do it well.
[18476.98s -> 18490.92s]  Is there a save point anywhere? Here is good to be a bubble gum entity. Welcome to bubble gum land.
[18492.31s -> 18505.00s]  The quest is so big. Big bubble gum spirit. Hello, red. By now you should have come across
[18505.00s -> 18511.50s]  the powers you wield. Only you can erase the inhabitants of this realm. The incredible power
[18511.50s -> 18516.70s]  which only you possess. Some life is supposed to extend into centuries while others are shorter.
[18517.58s -> 18523.82s]  If one is in a loop where they cannot die and yet they fear death, that is not a pleasant way to
[18523.82s -> 18531.02s]  live. That's why you, as the human, have a gift. You get to experience the world within all its
[18531.02s -> 18538.81s]  dualities. Unfairness and chaos. An expiration date. But someday this will all end. It is truly
[18538.81s -> 18545.72s]  the most bittersweet feature of your existence. I give you only my words of advice. If you're
[18545.72s -> 18551.74s]  doing this for a cause, a cause that is good, do what you think is right. If you do not agree,
[18551.74s -> 18556.78s]  then who is to stop a god of death? Much has been said. We must go on.
[18559.35s -> 18580.86s]  You didn't have a soul? All right, well, what's your deal? Oh, you found my backup secret hideout.
[18581.66s -> 18586.22s]  Now that you found me, what are you going to do? Are you going to finish me off because I
[18586.22s -> 18595.70s]  took your arm? Or are you going to stroll out where you came from? You are here to erase my
[18595.70s -> 18600.66s]  existence. You've destroyed my empire. You've ruined my reputation. You've forced me to flee
[18600.66s -> 18609.77s]  for my life. Your thirst to kill does not end only because I took your arm. You disgust me.
[18609.77s -> 18614.49s]  It's my life you want. I won't give it away easily. I will make you walk through hell.
[18615.13s -> 18658.68s]  Sure you will. Bubblegum hell. All right, let's go. Dude, it's easy. Just settle down.
[18659.56s -> 18724.94s]  You're going to let this shitty stuff hit you? Why do we keep seeing that thing? Someone's
[18724.94s -> 18734.07s]  vaping in your room, dude. You put on quite a show, you annoying wooden doll. You have bested me. I
[18734.07s -> 18741.06s]  wish thousands and millions of years of torment upon you. Hey, dude, you hit my car yesterday,
[18741.06s -> 18755.66s]  dickwad. Are you going to pay? You drove off and I'm going to go bankrupt. You hit my car.
[18769.46s -> 18787.24s]  There's two left. I'm assuming that's including me, right? It kind of has to be. Purple mage and me
[18787.24s -> 18797.82s]  are the last two people, right? Purple mage is waiting in the mirror of truth, praying.
[18797.82s -> 18832.31s]  And the theater only responds when you go back to the hub. Does that guy count? He's optional,
[18832.31s -> 18839.34s]  okay. Because I'll be honest with you, I don't know if my brain can handle fighting that guy again.
[18839.98s -> 18869.72s]  I could try maybe once or twice. How do I get out of here? Let's peep the horror. I don't have the
[18869.72s -> 18877.22s]  horror. All right, let's go up to the mirror, see what he has to say. I'm going to get a big
[18877.22s -> 18904.36s]  reveal, I guarantee it, right? Want my GameCube controller back? I don't have your GameCube
[18904.36s -> 18919.70s]  controller, man. All right, this is it. One of the final people to grab here. For many years,
[18919.70s -> 18924.98s]  I have been told that this mirror tells you the truth. I spent many nights thinking on this.
[18927.45s -> 18936.86s]  If you have any decency left, I urge you to leave, to stop this act and leave. You're not a killer.
[18936.86s -> 18944.17s]  Refund this game, if you can. Just leave us alone. Are we getting existential here?
[18950.57s -> 18956.57s]  You've come here to kill me. Maybe this was meant to be. Although, I won't give up my life easily.
[18957.21s -> 18964.63s]  Well, they say that because they know you're already five to six hours into the game,
[18964.63s -> 18970.66s]  you can't refund it. They don't put that shit an hour and 45 minutes into the game.
[18970.66s -> 19016.15s]  They put it six hours into the game. Oh, stop hitting me. It's all right, start it over again.
[19017.03s -> 19101.54s]  Sloppy. He's healing. Okay, stop being so sloppy. He's healing. This is one more.
[19101.54s -> 19133.66s]  This is how it ends. You fought well, I never stood a chance. The final gem. Go to the court
[19133.66s -> 19152.22s]  of the lost spirits. Back to those guys. All right, it's going to be me. It's definitely
[19152.22s -> 19169.67s]  going to be me. It's going to be me. I'm going to punch myself in the face and I'm going to end up
[19169.67s -> 19175.96s]  dying. I'm going to wake up somewhere in another world or something. Let me save it.
[19182.23s -> 19190.49s]  All right, so it's saved. Fight the light guy first. I don't think I have it in me.
[19190.49s -> 19210.81s]  Kill the lamp. Did I? Just do the light guy on easy mode. That's not a bad idea. I'll try that.
[19210.81s -> 19219.80s]  I'll turn it down just to see what happens when you win. Let's put it on normal or something.
[19219.80s -> 19247.69s]  Yeah, you can do it on normal. Okay, that's lame. Well, I want to see what happens. All right,
[19247.69s -> 19256.76s]  50% chance. All right, there it is. All right, this world is a shell. It gives me no pleasure
[19256.76s -> 19263.30s]  to witness this twisted experiment. All right, let's go for it. Let me just get the win here.
[19264.10s -> 19271.56s]  I'm not an expert. I just want to see the end. I'll put it back.
[19271.56s -> 19318.15s]  I can already read the chat messages that say lost on normal, so I can't lose.
[19328.41s -> 19406.95s]  All right, relax. Oh, fuck. I did it. That's heavy. Finally, a worthy warrior. Use it well.
[19407.75s -> 19436.47s]  That was pretty cool. What about the door in the forest? Is this my only opportunity to see that?
[19436.47s -> 19440.89s]  No one's left here. Okay. All right, let me save it here. I'm going to go look at it. That's true.
[19440.89s -> 19476.17s]  You can do it after the game, but that's in a while. Okay. Where? Do the right thing.
[19479.86s -> 19487.08s]  You're probably going to want to put this on normal again. Well, we'll find out.
[19493.83s -> 19519.26s]  That door was here somewhere. This one's okay. All right. What was that door over here? Where is it?
[19519.26s -> 19530.98s]  Do you like cucumbers? Yeah. Yeah. He's doing end of the screen voice. I'm kind of tired,
[19530.98s -> 19553.11s]  I'll be honest. My brain is... I feel like I've watched six movies. I'm so close here. This is
[19553.11s -> 19567.91s]  the final act of the game. I'm not going to stop now. Where is it? I feel like it was right here
[19567.91s -> 19608.54s]  somewhere. Oh, it's the thing. Is that professor's junk pile thing? Hello. Hello. Save. Down here.
[19608.54s -> 19614.66s]  The ending takes a while. You should probably just do it. How does it take a long time?
[19624.81s -> 19643.83s]  A jump rope holds itself up. You accept the challenge. Sure. All right. I'm going to give
[19643.83s -> 19741.70s]  this one my all here. I got enough time to do the ending. Attack yet. Whoa. Holy smokes.
[19741.70s -> 19764.52s]  I guess you don't kill this thing. Do you want to unlock the door with your arm? Sure.
[19770.28s -> 19796.07s]  Is that... All right. I got to just grab this. My head hurts. I got the aqua marine. All right.
[19796.07s -> 19811.98s]  Get me out. Get me out of here. Hey, my grandma said you're cute. All right. Well, just put me on
[19811.98s -> 19820.18s]  speaker. Put me on speaker. I'm going to assume that I'm on speaker. Put me on speaker now.
[19822.84s -> 19828.98s]  Hello there, darling. I just wanted to say I can't believe you think that I learned that I'm a cute
[19828.98s -> 19836.44s]  and attractive man. I don't know what you look like. I'm not entirely sure, but your grandson
[19836.44s -> 19842.57s]  seems to know quite a few. He's got a good taste. You know, I'm old. I don't know how old you are,
[19842.57s -> 19852.14s]  in particular, but I just want to say that your grandson's in good hands here. As he watches me,
[19852.14s -> 19859.18s]  I have a lot of good people here, a lot of friends and stuff, and family and everything.
[19859.18s -> 19863.10s]  Family's incredibly important, so I just want to let you know that your grandson's in a good place
[19863.10s -> 19874.41s]  right now. Do you think I'm cute? Thank you. Okay. Now take me off speakerphone. Dude,
[19874.41s -> 19903.62s]  pass the fucking joint. Dude, did you buy it? All right. Let's see the end. Remember, why do
[19903.62s -> 19931.16s]  you hate everything? What? I like frogs. All right. I'm ready. I'm going. I'm finishing the game.
[19931.16s -> 19940.86s]  I still have a little bit of juice left. I do. You're saying it's about an hour from here?
[19940.86s -> 19955.82s]  I have a little bit of gas left. I think I'm good to go. You got all the gems. Go in and out of the
[19955.82s -> 19973.64s]  blue door now. Do I actually have all the gems? I have aquamarine, emerald, and ruby. Where's the
[19973.64s -> 19991.11s]  diamond? Where's sapphire? Where's quartz? You're very close. The blue door is the true ending.
[19991.11s -> 20026.17s]  I gotta get out of here. No help. You've liberated everyone in the forest. The mushrooms are never
[20026.17s -> 20035.98s]  truly alive anyways. Okay. Final gem is black tourmaline. Well, then I must be pretty good for
[20035.98s -> 20047.48s]  my energy levels then. All right. So you think I can open the blue door? You mean this one here?
[20047.48s -> 20072.66s]  There's nothing alive in this part of the realm. Do you still wish to enter? So be it. I tell you
[20072.66s -> 20084.94s]  to budget. Oh, why is the game so quiet? Other blue door. Sorry about that. I turned it down from
[20084.94s -> 20103.75s]  blue door. The other blue door. In and out of a blue door. And that one? I mean this one here.
[20103.75s -> 20136.55s]  I would call that a gray door. Blue trim. Go in and out of it. The green door is better. I'm just
[20136.55s -> 20144.68s]  going in here. I'm just going in here. I'm just going in. I mean, there could be some super
[20144.68s -> 20157.22s]  secret weird thing. I'm just going for it. You have done a massive task. Everyone is dead except
[20157.22s -> 20163.96s]  one. Some of the ones you've slain might not approve of your actions. Those who felt wrong,
[20163.96s -> 20202.81s]  there will be reconciliation. It is time for you to come out. Hello, human. Or should I say,
[20202.81s -> 20211.32s]  hello, red? You've done well. It is time to go back home now. Close all the doors. Permanently.
[20211.32s -> 20228.54s]  Hardest part is coming up. Close all the doors. The door is locked. Okay, just get rid of all the
[20228.54s -> 20240.15s]  doors. Thank you for staying persistent and helping us. Finally, some peace in the world.
[20240.15s -> 20257.53s]  How do the doors talk? We had some good times. Now it's time to say goodbye. Okay. Finally,
[20257.53s -> 20277.30s]  peace blast. We meet again in another plane of existence. It's been awesome, buddy. Why is there
[20277.30s -> 20294.65s]  some nonchalant about this? You're doing the right thing. Am I going to come out of a birth canal?
[20294.65s -> 20298.94s]  Right? Am I about to like be born? Is this going to be like I'm born or something? It's supposed to be
[20298.94s -> 20313.02s]  purgatory. I'm going to wake up in a hospital bed. Stop the waiting room. Well done. This world has
[20313.02s -> 20318.38s]  lived for a long time. You have done a tremendous task. You could have quit any time you wanted.
[20318.38s -> 20322.70s]  But you pushed through even when it got difficult. This is a great feat that only a few could
[20322.70s -> 20333.22s]  accomplish. Use this determination wisely. Now only one remains. I told you it was me. As long
[20333.22s -> 20340.54s]  as the last star shines, we can't depart from this world. We shall grant you power to kill our son.
[20340.54s -> 20360.66s]  The rabbit? The final battle has begun. We must hurry. The last star needs to die for us to continue.
[20371.58s -> 20386.58s]  That was like Peter Griffin plays fucking Undertale. Oh god. Here we go.
[20390.54s -> 20409.02s]  Negative 103 Celsius. What? I can't catch that? What the fuck are you talking about?
[20409.02s -> 20415.43s]  Excuse me. I'm grabbing them. Do I have this timed wrong because it's stretched out?
[20415.43s -> 20511.53s]  Because the perceptions are warped. That's true. Ow. Ow. It's getting closer. It's getting closer.
[20511.53s -> 20565.53s]  Fuck you. Oh come on. Uh oh. Can I dodge? Damn. All right. Just blew up a son.
[20586.68s -> 20597.50s]  I'm sorry. It was open in the other window. I'm sorry. I had to put Larry David in there at the
[20597.50s -> 20667.80s]  very end. Victory screech. Uh oh. It's the absolute truth. Kingdom Hearts. Okay. Oh. I'm just shit so
[20667.80s -> 20672.52s]  bad. I'm not even kidding. I don't know what happened in like the 10 seconds that I started
[20672.52s -> 20684.34s]  this. Oh my god. What? I don't know why they crept up so hard on me. Oh. Okay. Let's go. Let's go.
[20686.18s -> 20737.42s]  The absolute truth. Okay. There's nothing to attack. I can't hurt it. I'm just going to queue
[20737.42s -> 20833.32s]  it up. All these lives you have destroyed. Who was wrong? Oh shit. I got to fight this guy.
[20833.80s -> 20897.40s]  Uh huh. Whatever you say. I don't know. Don't do that. Not now. Oh you can do better than that.
[20897.40s -> 20928.12s]  You can do better than that. Playtime is over. You thought you got away with no physical constraints.
[20929.16s -> 20935.82s]  We have the upper hand now. My hands are sweating and I have to shit. I'm going to shit my pants.
[20935.82s -> 20990.36s]  What? This has gone too far. Pink? Red has been helping us. We just didn't know. But they killed
[20990.36s -> 20999.94s]  us. Yes. They did. They did what I couldn't do. I thought- this person's naked. This person's
[20999.94s -> 21008.26s]  naked. I thought by not killing we should not fear death. I've read that so wrong. Look at that. I'm
[21008.26s -> 21011.62s]  a little on edge right now. I'm kind of like a lightning bolt. It's been really kind of tricky
[21011.62s -> 21021.46s]  to pay attention. I feel like somebody just put a blow dryer in my face for 15 straight minutes.
[21021.46s -> 21029.40s]  Do I have to keep going? Are you on Adderall? No. That was crazy. There was too much going on.
[21029.40s -> 21050.31s]  Are you still going? I can't understand how you went through with this monstrous act.
[21050.31s -> 21056.28s]  You're the only one with powers to kill in a world of immortals. Against their will you took
[21056.28s -> 21063.77s]  their lives. That's not true. Half of these people were like, yes please kill me. Hooray. I'm happy.
[21064.41s -> 21068.01s]  What do you mean against their will? Like 70% of the people were happy I was doing this.
[21068.01s -> 21077.56s]  Was it my purpose to kill everyone? What do you mean that's not true? Half the people were like,
[21077.56s -> 21084.71s]  yeah well here it is. I'm happy. Thank you. I was being thanked because I sent her on a mission.
[21084.71s -> 21089.61s]  Have I forgotten my destiny? Don't be mistaken. I have thought about this for many years.
[21090.62s -> 21094.94s]  So many wanted to end their lives and didn't struggle. Even if they had asked me I didn't-
[21094.94s -> 21102.54s]  I don't think I could have killed them. What are you talking about? You were the one that killed us.
[21102.54s -> 21108.94s]  What? No. It was the doll. Her body was burned up in the incinerator, pink.
[21110.54s -> 21116.07s]  But as always the main problem was that- what was it? The main problem is something- you were in
[21116.07s -> 21123.82s]  there. That's the issue. You were inside. To cope with losing your body you create an illusion.
[21123.82s -> 21135.24s]  What? Don't go. No. After everything you were still the killer. No it wasn't me. It was not me.
[21135.56s -> 21140.84s]  I did not kill you. I was not. I did not do that. I did not hit her. I am stuck here now.
[21141.64s -> 21147.56s]  Was this all a test? I cannot do this alone. Please Red, you have to help me. I beg you,
[21147.56s -> 21166.12s]  you have to help me. I cannot do it alone. Is Daffy Duck gonna come over here with a pencil
[21166.12s -> 21171.08s]  in his hand and be like, don't don't don't erase me. You're an idea. And I'm gonna start like
[21171.08s -> 21198.60s]  drawing shit on him. Not the entire body, but it will have to do. Control me like you have always
[21198.60s -> 21215.19s]  done. Please guide me. Is that the Konami code? I guess. Where do we go? Is it really all in my
[21215.19s -> 21228.44s]  head? It couldn't have been. I know you're out there. What if I- you'll be my eyes. I trusted you,
[21228.44s -> 21242.01s]  human. Guide me out of this hellscape. It works. I can't believe it. Sorry. I'll remain silent.
[21242.01s -> 21249.32s]  As long as I trust you, you can guide me. Shut up. You just said you were gonna stop talking.
[21269.67s -> 21278.30s]  It's a frog. What do you wanna do? The journey is almost over now. Do you wanna save? Yes.
[21283.02s -> 21294.18s]  Thanks. What do you wanna do? Hello, Pink. Knowing you've accomplished what I asked of you
[21294.90s -> 21300.20s]  makes me a very happy frog. Your biggest challenge is yet to come. Please,
[21300.20s -> 21309.26s]  stay and relax until you feel ready. Let me know if you have any questions. Okay. I mean,
[21309.26s -> 21316.18s]  I've got quite a lot of questions, actually. What is behind that? Beyond there lies the end of your
[21316.18s -> 21321.32s]  journey. I don't understand. I can give you a hundred different explanations for what's behind
[21321.32s -> 21326.36s]  that door. But in the end, you're gonna come out the birth canal either way. It don't matter
[21326.36s -> 21341.30s]  what I say. You just have to find out. Where are we? We're not in the physical world anymore.
[21341.30s -> 21346.39s]  We're not in the end either. We're in a sort of waiting room. Just for you to collect yourself
[21346.39s -> 21353.10s]  and come to peace. I'm fine. I don't have to- I'm fine. Like, I heard- I felt the gurgles for a
[21353.10s -> 21362.49s]  minute and now I'm fine. Don't worry. Is that how I'm supposed to do that? I'll admit, I did not
[21362.49s -> 21391.48s]  expect this. I'm sorry. Don't worry. If you're fine, then gamble on a fart. Why are you just
[21391.48s -> 21403.93s]  assuming and implying that I have to do that? I don't need- I don't have to do that. I'm just
[21403.93s -> 21428.41s]  kind of walking right now. There's nothing here. Oh, please. So what is the final boss, then?
[21428.41s -> 21457.08s]  It's gonna be me. It's- it's gonna be me. It smells horrible. Let it happen. Oh, no. Did I
[21457.08s -> 21467.66s]  shit my pants? It's cold. What? It doesn't feel good. It's uncomfortable. I didn't mean to. No,
[21467.66s -> 21480.31s]  no. I won't. I just killed him. Age will always get you human, but some of us found a way out.
[21480.31s -> 21487.29s]  But it requires immense determination. The only way for you out, Pink, is to surrender yourself.
[21487.85s -> 21496.60s]  But I think you already knew that. Have what it takes to save Pink. Yes. Good. You see things
[21496.60s -> 21504.38s]  through. That is a good trait, but it's far from looking. Look into the darkness. Face the abyss.
[21504.38s -> 21522.90s]  Shit your pants. Just do it. Water's getting deeper. It's cold. It doesn't feel good.
[21523.54s -> 21535.66s]  Uncomfortable. It hurts. Everything is burning. I guess I- I forgot a problem. That's- that's way-
[21535.66s -> 21557.94s]  that's, uh, a few too many Taco Bell Diablo sauces on that. Eagle funny. I know. Trust me. I get it.
[21557.94s -> 21579.37s]  What happened? Uh, I'm coming out of the birth canal. I told you. It's been some time since we
[21579.37s -> 21630.20s]  last saw each other. All right. Holy shit. We're all good friends and we all get together sometimes.
[21630.20s -> 21636.41s]  When you're feeling down and you're feeling out of luck and out of change, we will work together
[21636.41s -> 21642.17s]  and we will have- I'm sorry. I- that's what I expected. That's what I expected. I expected that.
[21642.17s -> 21656.22s]  You have to understand. I can't hear anything. I can't even hear my own thoughts.
[21656.94s -> 21662.71s]  I have no- I don't know what I sound like right now. I might- I've probably been talking so loud
[21662.71s -> 21669.19s]  this whole playthrough because I can't hear anything. There's a vacuum cleaner going behind me
[21669.19s -> 21683.43s]  and in front of me and on both sides of my ears. It has not been easy, but you made it into the-
[21683.43s -> 21691.62s]  what is this? You have fought- am I Jesus? You've fought well, Jesus. Most important thing.
[21692.26s -> 21694.42s]  Coming up here. It's still left.
[21699.51s -> 21748.33s]  We're going upside down again. Hey, stop doing that. We are reaching the end of time.
[21758.44s -> 21766.78s]  Okay. Okay. Can somebody press the tracking button on the remote, please?
[21767.58s -> 21801.24s]  I'm trying to watch The Simpsons from 1990 fucking 3. Give me something to shoot at him.
[21801.24s -> 21821.21s]  What the fuck? Will you behave? I don't know. Give me a bow and arrow to shoot at him, please.
[21835.03s -> 21862.41s]  Am I the Big Bang or something? My planet? Farewell. Thanks.
[21864.26s -> 21876.33s]  Oh my god. What are you doing, game? When you're out of luck and you're out of friends,
[21878.09s -> 21933.99s]  let me be the one to show you. So long. It's still going? Is this- am I getting looped?
[21933.99s -> 21959.78s]  Am I getting pitied? Oh shit. Don't lose now. Stop shaking the screen. Stop doing this.
[21960.42s -> 21986.84s]  Please, I can't see anything. Oh my god. Bro. Bro. Bro. Bro. Come on, bro. Dude, what the fuck?
[21986.84s -> 21997.90s]  I can't even like see anymore. I literally can't even see. Somebody's just screaming into my brain.
[21999.34s -> 22012.55s]  It's like- it's like somebody hitting me in the back of the head with a hammer every 10 seconds.
[22024.06s -> 22026.70s]  There are wow raid bosses that are not as long as this.
[22027.50s -> 22033.40s]  I remember like Ragnaros took like 40 minutes. I don't want to re- I don't want to do that again.
[22034.20s -> 22048.07s]  All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. I'm good. I'm good.
[22084.28s -> 22132.42s]  I don't want to see it anymore. No. Stop it.
[22133.30s -> 22146.97s]  Stop. Dude, I want to do that. It's- oh my god. Hey. Hey, you want to do this again
[22146.97s -> 22151.69s]  for another five straight fucking minutes? Stay strong. Stay determined.
[22152.73s -> 22157.13s]  Fly into me. Fly out of me. Because you're a baby and you're about to be in the universe.
[22157.13s -> 22163.24s]  I don't know whatever the fuck this is. Put it on easy just to see the end of the game.
[22171.00s -> 22175.16s]  My face is itchy. I'm losing my mind. All right. Wait. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. I got it.
[22175.80s -> 22213.30s]  Stop. All right. If I make another sound after this, I'm going to gift a thousand subs
[22215.29s -> 22448.66s]  until the end of the fight. Okay. Starting now. I can talk. Okay. I did it. I almost screamed when
[22448.66s -> 22458.82s]  it just did that. What happened? Where am I? When it did that second part right there,
[22458.82s -> 22463.06s]  when it just threw a bunch of- I almost screamed, but I was like, oh my god, I can't scream.
[22463.06s -> 22480.06s]  Am I dead? What am I? And you fart directly in- I'm not going to even say anything because
[22480.06s -> 22489.00s]  why do I read those? Do not worry. You have done well. This is the end of this life. Before we
[22489.00s -> 22517.48s]  venture forward, I have something to show you. It's going to be earth. I created earth. You're
[22517.48s -> 22528.71s]  awake. You did it. Apparently I did it. You freed everyone from the immortal realm. Welcome to the
[22528.71s -> 22536.47s]  waiting room. This is the place of reconciliation, the place after death and the end of the game.
[22541.43s -> 22549.86s]  This was the good end. It's been an absolute joyful experience to see you on this journey.
[22550.42s -> 22569.93s]  Some have waited for you here. Okay. This is the good ending. I actually was supposed to do this.
[22569.93s -> 22575.13s]  Look. Thank you for freeing me. You're truly a great warrior, but this world still has secrets
[22575.13s -> 22584.73s]  left to uncover. I've lost everything. The world doesn't exist. I'm not really me anymore. All these
[22584.73s -> 22594.86s]  things I used to care about, they don't matter. In a strange way, I feel relieved. I believe there
[22594.86s -> 22599.34s]  was another world after death. I thought everything would just stop and turn black for all eternity.
[22599.98s -> 22606.12s]  Maybe an eternity has already passed. I don't even know anymore. I'm glad it seems there is
[22606.12s -> 22615.35s]  more to life than what I thought. I feel stupid. I thought we were already in the afterlife,
[22615.35s -> 22619.99s]  but I'm happy there's another journey coming. I'm a bit sad that I've been quite accustomed to my
[22619.99s -> 22626.23s]  body. Existed for eons, maybe some change is good. It must have been hard for you to kill everyone.
[22626.79s -> 22636.06s]  I'm glad you took the role of Reaper. Here comes the birth canal. I'm telling you. Sometimes when
[22636.06s -> 22641.48s]  it gets really quiet, I hear a voice. I can't decide whether it's nice or some whatever. I have
[22641.48s -> 22647.66s]  a nice journey. Everyone's getting birthed. I knew you had it in you. It gives me great pleasure that
[22647.66s -> 22654.31s]  you were able to free the souls, including his by the way. Everyone did that D face when I did it to
[22654.31s -> 22666.36s]  him. Look what I did. Wait, why are you not going? You had a reason for coming here, didn't you?
[22667.99s -> 22672.58s]  As we are ending our chapter, I have a strange feeling there is more to this world.
[22676.60s -> 22682.15s]  Across to the other realm, I see. It will be a pleasure showing you this world, Red. Unfortunately
[22682.15s -> 22687.19s]  for you, human, you will not be joining us tonight. But don't worry. Your time will come soon enough.
[22687.19s -> 22697.27s]  Goodbye. You've done well. What a strange place you have brought me to. Kill them all again.
[22699.03s -> 22702.79s]  You did well, human. The inhabitants had been there a long time. It's great to finally see
[22702.79s -> 22708.87s]  them come back. As for you, Pink, I hope you understood what needed to be done. It was a
[22708.87s -> 22713.27s]  hard path, something no one should be forced to do. It is not good for the soul to be immortal.
[22713.27s -> 22728.09s]  You need to come home. Yeah, so it seems. Hi, guys. I was shocked with everything that happened,
[22728.09s -> 22731.45s]  but I'm happy with how it all turned out. I think Flan is happiest of us all.
[22736.33s -> 22740.09s]  You, Red? You've changed quite a bit. How long has it been since we saw each other?
[22742.25s -> 22751.35s]  I can't tell. I know we didn't leave on good terms, but I wanted to let you know that I'm
[22751.35s -> 22756.81s]  thankful for what you did. Grim is ready for it to end when he stops doing voices.
[22760.52s -> 22766.90s]  Yeah, if you're new to the channel, hour number like one, two, and three is like, oh, that's me,
[22766.90s -> 22771.62s]  Germa. Oh, hey, that's me. I had a great life and lots of friends. When you get to hour number four
[22771.62s -> 22777.85s]  and five and then six and so on, it's like, here, I'm just just me. We're just hanging out.
[22777.85s -> 22783.19s]  You can feel the energy levels like sap from my body. I've had a great life with lots of
[22783.19s -> 22788.30s]  friends and fun, but when I was alone, I didn't have such a great time. Anyway, happy you helped
[22788.30s -> 22795.86s]  me. Yeah, end of the stream voice. That's how you can tell. Do we have to send everybody or?
[22798.33s -> 22806.63s]  I did a good job looking forward to reward. This is it, huh? What was the point of that?
[22807.19s -> 22818.39s]  I got some thinking to do, Red or whoever you really are. Red, hi, Blue. I'm so happy to see
[22818.39s -> 22822.87s]  you again. Once I died, it felt very cold and everything became dark and it got a bit scary.
[22823.51s -> 22826.71s]  But after a while, that frightful feeling disappeared. And when I opened my eyes,
[22826.71s -> 22836.65s]  I was here. I knew you weren't a bad guy. All these people are respawning in the freezer.
[22839.19s -> 22842.87s]  Oh, we're going over. Oh, I didn't know I was an immortal. He's sending us over.
[22843.51s -> 22851.94s]  He's sending us over to the next realm. I didn't know I was an immortal. Knowing that there is
[22851.94s -> 22868.92s]  more. You still have like a cold up here. Send them to the birth canal. I wonder where we will
[22868.92s -> 22873.64s]  appear now. Are they going to like appear as like animals and humans and like bugs and stuff?
[22875.67s -> 22882.42s]  How do I know that I'm not just like having them reincarnate as like a beetle? I couldn't believe
[22882.42s -> 22887.19s]  that there was more to it all. I'm so thrilled. I assume the world would just cease to exist.
[22889.37s -> 22901.35s]  And then nothing, you know, this is truly astonishing. I never got the chance to truly
[22901.35s -> 22905.91s]  meet you for so many years. No, for so many decades, I've been living in a world of terror.
[22906.47s -> 22911.74s]  I was held prisoner by Professor Orange. They gave me things so I wouldn't couldn't leave.
[22912.38s -> 22917.18s]  I'm just happy it's all over now. But I do feel regret regret that I didn't take it into my own
[22917.18s -> 22925.48s]  hands and free myself from Professor Orange. I just gathered courage. I don't know. Still,
[22925.48s -> 22943.35s]  I'm very happy I'm finally free now. I am thankful. I was hurt. You. You helped me.
[22943.35s -> 22951.21s]  Professor Orange. Not so nice. To me. All right, so we're sending this guy to hell, right?
[22953.67s -> 22957.03s]  Had theories about there being additional layers of consciousness after death.
[22957.83s -> 22962.15s]  The rationalist and materialist in me couldn't let myself truly indulge in that fantasy.
[22962.15s -> 22966.71s]  In any case, I'm glad that there is a light beyond death. I'm sorry for my actions of malice
[22966.71s -> 22978.70s]  against you. I was technically sent to hell. Anybody else down here? We got everybody down here?
[22978.70s -> 22996.25s]  What about the street lamp? Okay. Thank you for everything. Do you want to save? Yes. Right here.
[22996.65s -> 23012.92s]  Amazing. Okay. I'm going to save your progress. No. I can't kill him. All right. Only a few more
[23012.92s -> 23031.34s]  people up here. I think this is it. Who's that? A Roblox character? This whole game was made in
[23031.34s -> 23042.17s]  Roblox? You did well. You can finally know peace. It wouldn't have been possible without you.
[23042.81s -> 23050.50s]  Seems like a good place for a fresh start. You can call me Bridge. Oh wait.
[23051.58s -> 23055.66s]  Honby. When you killed me, I was like, this is where it all ends. But then I didn't.
[23055.66s -> 23063.34s]  I'm ready for something new. I will be honest with you, Pink. I never expected the afterlife
[23063.34s -> 23069.34s]  would look like this. It's been nice, but I do feel a bit sad. Are you sad? No. I have a heart of
[23069.34s -> 23074.65s]  stone, you know. Maybe that's how you were able to do it all. And we're just, we're sending them
[23074.65s -> 23080.12s]  over in their essences and energies. We're going to fire a laser and blow up a planet. That's like
[23080.12s -> 23089.78s]  why we did this whole thing was for that. Bye. Get out of here. I'm sorry. He didn't leave. I'm
[23089.78s -> 23094.76s]  sorry for attacking pink. I thought I did the right thing. It's both exciting and a bit, uh,
[23095.40s -> 23101.66s]  whatever that word is, it starts with an M and ends in ellencolic. Oh, melancholic, like melancholy.
[23102.38s -> 23106.54s]  We're going to leave this realm. I've lived for so long that I feel like there's so much more for
[23106.54s -> 23113.22s]  me to discover. Thank you for all the good times, Pink. Thank you, Ross the Beast. You're always
[23113.22s -> 23122.50s]  looking out for me. You need to get out of here. All right, nothing gets past you. All right,
[23123.30s -> 23141.70s]  gotta be gone. All right, we cleared it out. Nobody left. Put everybody on. Now it's time.
[23142.42s -> 23150.15s]  Hello, human. Are you ready to end the game? Yes. It's been a spectacle watching you.
[23150.79s -> 23159.72s]  Let us say farewell in a way it deserves to end. God, more. Do I have to fight God now?
[23161.99s -> 23177.24s]  You kidding me? I don't want to fight God. I don't want to fight God. Everyone's leaving.
[23178.04s -> 23191.70s]  Am I going to try to hurt them or are we going to dance over the credits?
[23192.42s -> 23217.85s]  How come it's just those guys? I want the whole and I want the whole cast.
[23245.75s -> 23252.63s]  All right. All right, guys, guys, guys. Okay. I'm done. I'm done. I'm really tired.
[23254.52s -> 23258.68s]  Everyone go live your next life and ship. I don't want to do this anymore. I'm fucking tired.
[23262.34s -> 23269.32s]  You don't understand how long I've had to do this for. Goodbye, everybody. Goodbye. Goodbye.
[23270.12s -> 23277.22s]  Thanks. Thank you. I swear to God, I'm going to start throwing you outside the side of my window
[23277.22s -> 23292.06s]  like a fucking newspaper if you don't leave. Thank you. I hope you found this experience.
[23292.06s -> 23301.13s]  Let's try to kill me with that last chord. Oh, okay. Dick. Before we close the curtains,
[23301.13s -> 23308.87s]  I'd like to thank all the Kickstarter supporters and everyone on Patreon. I hope it does that.
[23308.87s -> 23320.34s]  Please do that. That would be fucking awesome. Let me dance over all the Kickstarter names.
[23320.34s -> 23337.13s]  Come on. Thanks for everything. Always to let me get out. Can't leave me alone.
[23337.93s -> 23361.80s]  I won't let me rest. Thanks to you, I can finally sleep. Yeah, that'd be great when I get to do that
[23361.80s -> 23369.54s]  too. You want room service? Anybody here want room service? Want to call Toshiers? Anybody need
[23369.54s -> 23381.85s]  anything? You're always sort of annoying. You know what? Send that guy to hell. Send that guy to
[23381.85s -> 23386.25s]  hell. I want that guy dead again. I want that guy to go back to the immortal world. I don't want to
[23386.25s -> 23396.42s]  give him eternal fucking beautiful life. Send that guy to hell. It's been a pleasure. Thank you.
[23397.62s -> 23408.44s]  Thank you for helping me. Yes. I'm so happy there's more. I'm just waiting for this to cut
[23408.44s -> 23415.88s]  and we're in a giant bus and we just go off a cliff. Oh, we're going to venture beyond the
[23416.04s -> 23423.26s]  and then it just cuts to like real. We go off like a fucking cliff and the car explodes.
[23424.22s -> 23470.65s]  That health bar is huge. That health bar is massive. It's so massive. Thank you for playing my game.
[23470.65s -> 23486.94s]  See you later. Please stop thanking me. Yeah, we did. One thank you is enough. I don't need to
[23486.94s -> 23498.57s]  hear more than one thank you. Here we are at the end of the road. We have witnessed an eventful
[23498.57s -> 23507.45s]  journey. Many words have been said. Thoughts have been shared. Before you leave, do you wish
[23507.45s -> 23519.40s]  to hear the last absolute truth? Sure. What is it? There are no absolute truths. Yes, there is.
[23519.40s -> 23525.61s]  Chocolate is delicious. That's an absolute truth. Nobody can disagree with that. You're free to
[23525.61s -> 23535.21s]  wrap your half truths into whatever. No, that is the true beauty of it. You can make the rest up.
[23535.21s -> 23542.86s]  You still have a long time. No, that's not a good idea. That's not a good idea because that's how
[23543.10s -> 23550.22s]  Facebook and Twitter got so fucked up. No, no, no. Let's focus on truth, please.
[23550.22s -> 23562.25s]  You still have a time left and some time after that. Oh yeah, the thing about truth is you just
[23562.25s -> 23575.00s]  make a bunch of shit up. Who cares? Who cares about that truth stuff? I'm not going to skip
[23575.00s -> 23587.69s]  the credits. That's not what it means. There's no Facebook dude in heaven. Oh, how do you know that?
[23587.69s -> 23591.13s]  You don't know that. You don't know what it is. You don't even know what it looks like.
[23591.77s -> 23604.87s]  You want the alien rant again? Take care of yourself. Thank you, friend. What the fuck is
[23604.87s -> 23627.99s]  happening? Come and visit us again. It never ends in everhood. New game plus.
[23641.26s -> 23645.58s]  All right, I'm going to give you my full my opinion. Played through the whole game. Took
[23645.58s -> 23656.14s]  about seven and a half hours. I tell you, I believe that that was very solid. I would say
[23656.14s -> 23663.05s]  that was a highly recommend. It's very good. It was definitely worth playing for sure.
[23669.94s -> 23689.42s]  That was very good. What would you give? What about a rating? New game plus for the good ending.
[23689.42s -> 23699.61s]  I don't think so. Game grew on me a lot after I beat it and thought about it more. Please write
[23699.61s -> 23703.38s]  to us and tell us how our game made you feel. Our email is in the store page. I'll tell you right
[23703.38s -> 23709.77s]  now. It made me feel I had a lot of emotions. It made me feel all kinds of things like what is
[23709.77s -> 23720.04s]  life? What is death? This game contains flashing lights that can be dangerous. No, it's very good.
[23720.04s -> 23742.68s]  But this is this is now looks different. What happened? Oh, you can replay battles. That's
[23742.68s -> 23754.07s]  cool. All right, I think I'm going to call it here. That was really good. Now I understand
[23754.07s -> 23757.99s]  why everybody said, dude, don't just play the don't just like drink half a bottle of wine and
[23757.99s -> 23763.93s]  play like the first level. I get it. That was a that was a very, very fantastic time. I had a
[23763.93s -> 23776.58s]  great time. Hope you did too. The next time that you see me live, I will see you on the 20th of
[23776.58s -> 23780.18s]  the next four or five days. I've got a lot of stuff I need to do, a lot of work to do,
[23781.86s -> 23790.23s]  especially on the big stream that's happening on the 1st of February. A lot of stuff to do.
[23790.23s -> 23797.48s]  On the 20th, that's Thursday, we're going to play Hitman VR. It releases on the 20th. I'm
[23797.48s -> 23812.55s]  very excited for that. I feel like that's going to be a lot of fun. And I will see you guys later.
[23812.55s -> 23820.62s]  He's stalling? The stream is over, man. But yeah, Hitman VR will be the 20th. I'm assuming I'll
[23821.18s -> 23825.62s]  here's one thing I want to make really clear about the VR streams is because the last time
[23825.62s -> 23829.86s]  I did VR, I kind of really had a lot of trouble and a lot of problems afterwards.
[23829.86s -> 23835.43s]  So what's going to happen with those streams is I'm probably only going to be in the headset
[23835.43s -> 23841.67s]  for like maybe two or three hours each time. I just physically can't do more than like three,
[23841.67s -> 23848.14s]  four hours in the headset. I just can't. So yeah, for those of you that don't know,
[23848.14s -> 23858.79s]  I have some medical issues with my chest and back. Even seated VR probably would be too much.
[23858.79s -> 23863.86s]  Yeah, probably two or three hours. Maybe I'll push it a little more past three if I'm having
[23863.86s -> 23870.98s]  a great time. But the 20th, we'll do it again. Maybe on like the 22nd or something, 23rd,
[23870.98s -> 23877.14s]  24th. I will do it a few times in a row, but just not a whole lot of time in the headset in a row.
[23877.14s -> 23886.98s]  Like I'm in the same setting. It should be fun. I'm looking forward to it. You should go back to
[23886.98s -> 23896.14s]  Everett and try the pacifist run. Maybe I'll do that on my own time. But thanks for hanging out.
[23896.14s -> 23905.10s]  Hopefully you guys had a good time. And we'll see you again in four or five days on the 20th.
[23905.18s -> 23915.42s]  It's man time for that. Let's go. I'm going to say four o'clock Pacific. That might come back
[23915.42s -> 23920.57s]  to like two or three, depending on if I can get my sleep schedule in the right spot. But plan on four,
[23920.57s -> 23925.59s]  although it could be pulled back to like something as early as two or three. I really want to get
[23925.59s -> 23931.16s]  back on that like 2 p.m. Pacific schedule because it is right now pretty late for everybody,
[23931.16s -> 23943.34s]  not just East Coast. And that's it. Have a wonderful evening, everybody. Take care of
[23943.34s -> 23952.57s]  yourselves. You know, hey, do one good thing today. You know what I mean? Do something good
[23952.57s -> 23957.62s]  today. You know what I mean? So you can breathe in the air and breathe it out and go,
[23957.62s -> 23969.77s]  that feels good. I did something good. Do it. Just do it. Why not? Do it. No. Okay. Good night.
[23969.77s -> 23975.26s]  Well, yeah, it's too late. The day's over. Yeah. Never mind. Do it tomorrow. Do something nice
[23975.26s -> 23981.11s]  tomorrow for somebody. I don't know. Yeah. Forget about the rest of the day. Just, you know, you'll
[23981.11s -> 23992.90s]  be asleep. It's like negative 30 outside. I'm not going anywhere. Call your mother and say hi.
[23992.90s -> 24001.83s]  Mom, it's good to hear from you. I'll see you guys on Thursday. Take care. Have a good night. Goodbye.
