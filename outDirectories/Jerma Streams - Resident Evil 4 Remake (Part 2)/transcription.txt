[25.72s -> 35.12s]  What's up? How's it going?
[35.12s -> 39.46s]  What are you doing?
[39.46s -> 50.85s]  Yeah, today we're going to be continuing the Resident Evil 4 Remake playthrough.
[50.85s -> 55.49s]  Last thing we did, if you're trying to avoid any spoilers or something.
[55.49s -> 60.22s]  We killed the, uh...
[60.22s -> 62.42s]  How do I say it? I don't want to spoil it.
[62.42s -> 64.22s]  Big body of water.
[64.22s -> 69.10s]  Something there.
[69.10s -> 72.97s]  I don't want to spoil it for anybody.
[72.97s -> 75.37s]  We killed the big monster in the lake.
[75.37s -> 77.11s]  That was the last thing we did.
[77.21s -> 81.02s]  And we moved on a little bit. We did like another couple of areas.
[81.02s -> 82.52s]  I spoiled it.
[82.52s -> 84.37s]  It's okay.
[84.37s -> 89.36s]  Crap.
[89.36s -> 92.57s]  Yeah, how you doing?
[92.57s -> 94.87s]  Not going to waste too much time in the intro because I really want to play.
[94.87s -> 97.37s]  I've been wanting to play this game.
[97.37s -> 102.20s]  I was considering reverse delaying yesterday.
[102.20s -> 103.50s]  I was like, you know what?
[103.50s -> 105.74s]  I don't think I'm going to do it.
[105.74s -> 109.20s]  And Holly and I looked at the clock.
[109.20s -> 113.69s]  It was one o'clock in the morning.
[113.69s -> 115.79s]  It's like, well, I can't do that now.
[115.89s -> 119.38s]  I can't do that.
[119.38s -> 120.28s]  It's like, oh, man.
[120.28s -> 121.68s]  No, reverse delay?
[121.68s -> 122.48s]  Maybe.
[122.48s -> 123.78s]  What time is it?
[123.78s -> 124.48s]  1 a.m.
[124.48s -> 130.55s]  Oh, never mind.
[130.55s -> 132.35s]  Yeah, let's just go.
[132.35s -> 138.67s]  I don't got very much to talk about besides this.
[138.67s -> 141.00s]  Stop staying up so late.
[141.00s -> 142.20s]  I don't really stay up that late.
[142.20s -> 143.10s]  Well, that's a lie.
[143.10s -> 146.04s]  Recently I've been staying up pretty late.
[146.04s -> 148.30s]  But I...
[148.30s -> 150.50s]  I want to say the last few years,
[150.50s -> 156.72s]  I've really tried to go to bed before 3 a.m.
[156.72s -> 159.12s]  Really, really try to do it.
[159.12s -> 163.34s]  It can be so hard, though.
[163.34s -> 166.82s]  I try to get to bed somewhere between 2 and 4,
[166.82s -> 173.25s]  which will reliably allow me to wake up at some point in the morning into the...
[173.25s -> 176.19s]  Because I don't like waking up early in the morning.
[176.19s -> 178.79s]  It doesn't matter if I have seven or eight hours of sleep
[178.79s -> 180.99s]  and I wake up at 8 a.m., 7 a.m.,
[180.99s -> 182.69s]  I feel fucked up.
[182.69s -> 186.20s]  And it's been like that forever.
[186.20s -> 189.54s]  Since I was a kid, all through school,
[189.54s -> 196.51s]  all through my early adult life into my kind of mid-stage adult life here.
[196.51s -> 199.21s]  I just cannot operate at 7 to 8 o'clock in the morning.
[199.21s -> 200.71s]  I can't...
[200.71s -> 204.05s]  I feel like that's forever.
[204.05s -> 207.46s]  But you move that forward
[207.46s -> 215.11s]  instead of going to bed at 10, 11, 12, waking up at 7, 6, 7, 8.
[215.11s -> 217.21s]  I don't know what, you move it forward two hours.
[217.21s -> 223.54s]  I go to bed at 2 or 3 in the morning, wake up at like 10, 11, 3 a.m. to 10.
[223.54s -> 225.34s]  It just works better for me. I don't know why.
[225.34s -> 227.04s]  You're a vampire, huh?
[227.04s -> 236.83s]  Oh, I don't think so.
[236.83s -> 238.33s]  Is he going to play the game?
[238.33s -> 239.43s]  I just turn...
[239.43s -> 240.73s]  I know you just fuck with me.
[240.73s -> 242.83s]  You're trying to get me to go off.
[242.83s -> 244.83s]  And I'm going to be better about that.
[244.83s -> 248.14s]  I can tell now.
[248.14s -> 250.94s]  You know how you guys can tell when I'm doing a bit...
[250.94s -> 254.14s]  Oh, here comes the bit voice.
[254.14s -> 259.64s]  I can tell now when you guys are writing the LOL Vitamix blender.
[259.64s -> 261.44s]  Like, oh, hey, what blender should I get?
[261.44s -> 264.44s]  I'm aware of that now.
[264.44s -> 268.87s]  You don't think I started to sense this?
[268.87s -> 270.87s]  It only took you like six years.
[270.87s -> 273.25s]  I mean, I'm...
[273.25s -> 277.61s]  Yeah, that's true.
[277.61s -> 279.21s]  Can you play Project Zomboid?
[279.21s -> 282.07s]  I wanted to.
[282.07s -> 292.16s]  I wanted... There's too many things I want to do.
[292.16s -> 293.06s]  Sorry, I didn't say anything.
[293.06s -> 294.86s]  I was just stirring up this fucking tea.
[294.86s -> 296.23s]  All right.
[296.23s -> 297.43s]  You guys ready?
[297.43s -> 298.23s]  Resident Evil 4?
[298.23s -> 302.68s]  You guys good?
[302.68s -> 309.22s]  Oh, also, there's a new Grotto Beast video talking about deck building.
[309.22s -> 309.92s]  You want to...
[309.92s -> 312.22s]  The Grotto Beast YouTube has a new video.
[312.22s -> 314.82s]  If you want to go check it out, if you're not into that,
[314.82s -> 322.73s]  then hey, Resident Evil 4 is about to begin.
[322.73s -> 332.10s]  Let me link it so you can see it.
[332.10s -> 335.47s]  Yeah, our game designer is making these.
[335.47s -> 338.17s]  Grotto Beast has a YouTube if you want to check it out.
[338.17s -> 347.06s]  It's part two of a series.
[347.06s -> 348.46s]  There you are.
[348.46s -> 349.66s]  Why is my chat going so slow?
[349.66s -> 351.36s]  No, not like my chat is going so slow.
[351.36s -> 356.10s]  Like, computer is going slow.
[356.10s -> 357.50s]  Why is my chat going so slow?
[357.50s -> 358.90s]  That sounds like egomania.
[358.90s -> 362.16s]  No, I'm saying like my computer is slow right now.
[362.16s -> 370.43s]  Why?
[370.43s -> 371.43s]  All right, you guys ready?
[371.43s -> 373.23s]  Resident Evil 4 headphones are going in.
[373.23s -> 374.43s]  I got my drink.
[374.43s -> 377.92s]  I've tweeted and I'm ready to play.
[377.92s -> 380.80s]  I've been waiting for this.
[380.80s -> 381.50s]  What's up?
[381.50s -> 385.15s]  How are you?
[385.15s -> 387.28s]  Both headphones are in.
[387.28s -> 388.38s]  I can't turn the lights off.
[388.38s -> 390.08s]  I'm on the West Coast.
[390.08s -> 391.08s]  I'm on Pacific time.
[391.08s -> 395.38s]  So it's it's almost six o'clock Pacific, but I can't turn the lights off.
[395.38s -> 398.19s]  They already are off.
[398.19s -> 404.23s]  When it gets darker, I will turn off some things and we will have a nice scary environment.
[404.23s -> 409.00s]  I promise.
[409.00s -> 412.08s]  What about your you have blinds?
[412.08s -> 416.49s]  They don't they don't lock out everything.
[416.49s -> 418.88s]  It doesn't matter.
[418.88s -> 419.58s]  You know what?
[419.58s -> 428.52s]  I've thought about getting but I actually don't want you know those hotel complete blackout curtains.
[428.52s -> 435.40s]  Those things those things are so dangerous.
[435.40s -> 445.10s]  I don't really want those because when it gets to be 7 8 9 10 11 12 o'clock if it's still pitch black in your room
[445.10s -> 447.90s]  and you kind of wake up for a second, it's like oh, it's still nighttime.
[447.90s -> 448.60s]  I'm so tired.
[448.60s -> 449.70s]  It's sleep time.
[449.70s -> 453.41s]  Having natural sunlight kind of come in.
[453.41s -> 455.71s]  Otherwise, I will sleep till 5 o'clock in the afternoon.
[455.71s -> 462.90s]  If I have blackout curtains, it throws me off big time big time.
[462.90s -> 465.80s]  Okay, they are nice though.
[465.80s -> 471.36s]  They are they are nice.
[471.36s -> 475.45s]  I have them and to be honest, it does make it harder.
[475.45s -> 478.15s]  You know, I want to get a sleep mask.
[478.15s -> 481.30s]  I want to get one of those eye things.
[481.30s -> 484.00s]  Is it bogus that that actually makes you sleep a little better?
[484.00s -> 486.09s]  Is that for real?
[486.09s -> 492.68s]  Those things work.
[492.68s -> 493.98s]  It blocks out light.
[493.98s -> 494.58s]  Well, it's the same.
[494.58s -> 495.48s]  Wait, it's the same thing.
[495.48s -> 498.08s]  It's having blackout curtains in front of your face.
[498.08s -> 501.58s]  So that would probably be bad for me.
[501.58s -> 506.18s]  If I don't want blackout curtains, then I shouldn't do like blackout thing on my eyes.
[506.18s -> 508.20s]  That would be bad.
[508.20s -> 510.70s]  No, whatever just wear sunglasses to bed.
[510.70s -> 523.16s]  All right, let's go curtains work better than a sleep mask.
[523.16s -> 524.56s]  I'm going to give you a black eye.
[524.56s -> 525.26s]  All right.
[525.26s -> 526.36s]  All right, dude.
[526.36s -> 529.97s]  All right, settle down.
[529.97s -> 536.43s]  All right, settle down.
[536.43s -> 537.03s]  Next game.
[537.03s -> 538.83s]  No, get out of here.
[538.83s -> 539.13s]  All right.
[539.13s -> 545.02s]  What was I doing?
[545.02s -> 547.02s]  I got another gem for this, didn't I?
[547.02s -> 548.52s]  Ruby's all rubbish.
[548.52s -> 550.22s]  It makes no difference.
[550.22s -> 552.32s]  The price will.
[552.32s -> 554.12s]  That's our choice to make.
[554.12s -> 555.52s]  Is it okay if I gamble?
[555.52s -> 557.22s]  To suit your specific...
[557.22s -> 557.82s]  I don't know.
[557.82s -> 558.92s]  Are you old enough?
[558.92s -> 560.82s]  It's a thing of beauty.
[560.82s -> 562.12s]  Wait, I don't know.
[562.12s -> 563.02s]  I can't answer that question.
[563.02s -> 563.82s]  I don't know.
[563.82s -> 569.06s]  The answer is probably no.
[569.06s -> 571.93s]  Are you using it for entertainment value only?
[571.93s -> 574.33s]  Are you using it for entertainment value only?
[574.33s -> 576.43s]  Okay.
[576.43s -> 582.63s]  Let's see.
[582.63s -> 583.13s]  Yes.
[583.13s -> 584.78s]  Okay.
[584.78s -> 586.28s]  The answer is no.
[586.28s -> 588.86s]  Don't.
[588.86s -> 595.51s]  That's all there is to it.
[595.51s -> 598.91s]  This is the new pistol I got and this thing is unbelievable.
[598.91s -> 599.31s]  I think I...
[599.31s -> 599.71s]  All right.
[599.71s -> 604.80s]  Should I sell the other pistol and just dump it into this?
[604.80s -> 605.50s]  The game's a little quiet.
[605.50s -> 608.19s]  I'll fix that.
[608.19s -> 608.89s]  I probably should.
[608.89s -> 609.99s]  This is like the best gun.
[609.99s -> 612.09s]  Not seeing anything you like, stranger.
[612.09s -> 615.92s]  I'm selling the thing that I was using.
[615.92s -> 617.12s]  Nineteen thousand.
[617.12s -> 622.70s]  I'll buy almost anything.
[622.70s -> 625.19s]  This is not stupid, right?
[625.19s -> 627.29s]  Because then I'm going to dump it all into the...
[627.29s -> 631.03s]  Because this weapon is awesome.
[631.03s -> 631.83s]  This is the play.
[631.83s -> 632.63s]  This is what you do.
[632.63s -> 633.53s]  I'm selling it.
[633.53s -> 634.03s]  I'm selling it.
[634.03s -> 634.53s]  And people...
[634.53s -> 634.83s]  Whatever.
[634.83s -> 639.65s]  I've ruined my playthrough.
[639.65s -> 642.85s]  A deal well struck.
[642.85s -> 644.40s]  Okay.
[644.40s -> 647.00s]  I want ammo capacity.
[647.00s -> 648.70s]  There you are.
[648.70s -> 650.81s]  I want power.
[650.81s -> 651.91s]  Dazzled.
[651.91s -> 653.51s]  And I want...
[653.51s -> 658.47s]  Our craftsmanship demands no less.
[658.47s -> 661.11s]  Ammo capacity again.
[661.11s -> 661.51s]  There we go.
[661.51s -> 671.84s]  We're starting to get an idea of your taste, friend.
[671.84s -> 672.04s]  I know.
[672.04s -> 672.54s]  I'm stalling.
[672.54s -> 672.94s]  I am.
[672.94s -> 675.54s]  This is like one of the best games ever made.
[675.54s -> 677.04s]  I'm going to stall a little.
[677.04s -> 680.30s]  Lack of skew, friend.
[680.30s -> 681.30s]  I'll have a knife too.
[681.30s -> 682.97s]  I should do this.
[682.97s -> 683.07s]  All right.
[683.07s -> 683.97s]  Well, this thing is awesome.
[683.97s -> 684.77s]  I'm going to use it.
[684.77s -> 687.17s]  It's going to be so deadly.
[687.17s -> 690.92s]  Everyone's going to be so jealous that they don't have this.
[690.92s -> 693.30s]  Because I knew where it was.
[693.30s -> 696.00s]  Why am I sinking?
[696.00s -> 697.80s]  That was weird, wasn't it?
[697.80s -> 701.92s]  Was that weird to anybody else?
[701.92s -> 702.92s]  That was kind of weird, wasn't it?
[702.92s -> 703.92s]  Did I just lose my mind?
[703.92s -> 706.76s]  That was weird.
[706.76s -> 713.17s]  I felt like my character was sinking into the ground.
[713.17s -> 713.47s]  I don't know.
[713.47s -> 715.05s]  That was...
[715.05s -> 716.85s]  Oh, it's because there's an incline here.
[716.95s -> 718.90s]  Okay.
[718.90s -> 719.50s]  I was wondering.
[719.50s -> 720.70s]  I was like, why can I...
[720.70s -> 724.50s]  Why am I like at eye level with the save thing with the typewriter?
[724.50s -> 727.12s]  What?
[727.12s -> 727.32s]  All right.
[727.32s -> 731.97s]  So the last thing we were doing, we're going now to two locations.
[731.97s -> 735.42s]  I got to get in the boat and go down here.
[735.42s -> 740.54s]  But we're going to be a hundred percent completion, Andy.
[740.54s -> 743.17s]  And I think I'm going to go this way.
[743.17s -> 746.44s]  Can I even get there from here?
[746.44s -> 747.24s]  And where's the boat?
[747.24s -> 750.20s]  The boat's down here.
[750.20s -> 751.70s]  I got to go down the stairs.
[751.70s -> 755.24s]  Okay.
[755.24s -> 758.12s]  I already tried that.
[758.12s -> 758.82s]  Sell the crown.
[758.82s -> 763.42s]  I'm not selling the crown until I have all gems fully socketed.
[763.42s -> 767.24s]  I'm not selling until I get it fully socketed.
[767.24s -> 768.34s]  Why do you look so angry?
[768.34s -> 770.85s]  It's just my face, man.
[770.85s -> 771.15s]  I'm sorry.
[771.15s -> 776.47s]  This is my face.
[776.47s -> 776.77s]  All right.
[776.77s -> 780.69s]  So did I try to go?
[780.69s -> 781.89s]  I don't think I docked here.
[781.89s -> 787.13s]  Let me try it.
[787.13s -> 787.43s]  Yeah.
[787.43s -> 787.63s]  Okay.
[787.63s -> 793.97s]  I can go this way.
[793.97s -> 795.37s]  What do I have for a weapon right now?
[795.37s -> 795.87s]  There it is.
[795.87s -> 800.16s]  There it is.
[800.16s -> 803.36s]  This thing is awesome.
[803.36s -> 807.52s]  Can't go that way.
[807.52s -> 828.51s]  I've been so waiting to play this too.
[828.51s -> 835.43s]  Both headphones go in.
[835.43s -> 840.26s]  Watch out.
[840.26s -> 840.86s]  There's no jump.
[840.86s -> 848.52s]  I don't know why I just tried to jump with spacebar.
[848.52s -> 855.54s]  Not bad, right?
[855.54s -> 872.12s]  This gun's awesome.
[872.12s -> 880.12s]  Oh man.
[880.12s -> 885.56s]  What the fuck just happened?
[885.56s -> 902.86s]  Can you parry these things?
[902.86s -> 903.96s]  Oh my God, please.
[903.96s -> 904.96s]  The glasses.
[904.96s -> 910.10s]  The glasses is staying on permanently.
[910.10s -> 912.80s]  I want to put on all the other stuff too, but you know, whatever.
[912.80s -> 913.60s]  We'll see what happens.
[913.60s -> 915.00s]  I've been playing on stream for a while tonight.
[915.00s -> 926.11s]  So hmm.
[926.11s -> 927.51s]  But he looks so lame.
[927.51s -> 929.83s]  You can't even see.
[929.83s -> 932.73s]  You don't even know that he has sunglasses on right now.
[932.73s -> 933.53s]  You don't even know that.
[933.53s -> 935.59s]  You can't even see it.
[935.59s -> 944.02s]  It's only when he talks and the camera zooms in on his face that everybody gets mad.
[944.02s -> 956.94s]  Okay, go up.
[956.94s -> 960.13s]  Shortcut.
[960.13s -> 961.53s]  How do I turn it around again?
[961.53s -> 972.44s]  Q.
[972.44s -> 977.14s]  Nope.
[977.14s -> 979.14s]  Like I just threw it behind his head.
[979.14s -> 983.29s]  What?
[983.29s -> 984.09s]  What's wrong with me?
[984.09s -> 989.98s]  Why am I like coughing?
[989.98s -> 991.98s]  Like I threw that shit backwards.
[991.98s -> 992.58s]  That was...
[992.58s -> 993.48s]  Oh my God.
[993.48s -> 1004.54s]  I'm gonna fucking die.
[1004.54s -> 1006.14s]  Oh shit, that works.
[1006.14s -> 1019.19s]  Okay, that does work.
[1019.19s -> 1025.88s]  I don't know why he threw a Molotov at me and my throat hurt.
[1025.88s -> 1026.48s]  Okay, that's good.
[1026.48s -> 1028.49s]  Let's go.
[1028.49s -> 1031.27s]  There's more shit over here though.
[1031.27s -> 1039.78s]  Back here.
[1039.78s -> 1041.38s]  Oh, I could have done that.
[1041.38s -> 1041.68s]  It's all right.
[1041.68s -> 1043.26s]  Whatever.
[1043.26s -> 1050.53s]  I'm going to go that way though.
[1050.53s -> 1064.52s]  Good.
[1064.52s -> 1075.77s]  I don't want to miss anything.
[1075.77s -> 1081.33s]  Heard somebody.
[1081.33s -> 1089.37s]  What the hell is this guy?
[1089.37s -> 1100.62s]  You know what we haven't heard yet?
[1100.62s -> 1105.99s]  We haven't heard that one.
[1105.99s -> 1114.69s]  The really grungy, gravelly one.
[1114.69s -> 1116.81s]  That was one of my favorites.
[1116.81s -> 1123.44s]  What is this guy doing?
[1123.44s -> 1127.04s]  Is this a zombie or is this a guy also playing Resident Evil?
[1127.04s -> 1133.78s]  Oh, it's a zombie.
[1133.78s -> 1139.43s]  Hi.
[1139.43s -> 1139.73s]  Okay.
[1139.73s -> 1144.34s]  Well, I'm taking this.
[1144.34s -> 1147.13s]  Running out of ammo.
[1147.13s -> 1148.43s]  He's playing the game better than you.
[1148.43s -> 1151.63s]  Well, he's gone and I'm still here.
[1151.63s -> 1164.25s]  So, sorry.
[1164.25s -> 1165.35s]  Oh, that was...
[1165.35s -> 1188.33s]  That's him.
[1188.33s -> 1204.98s]  Don't put it down.
[1204.98s -> 1212.23s]  Don't get up.
[1212.23s -> 1214.86s]  Shit.
[1214.86s -> 1221.68s]  What the fuck?
[1221.68s -> 1227.28s]  I'm getting hit way too many times.
[1227.28s -> 1231.89s]  And for being a hardcore gamer playing on standard,
[1231.89s -> 1240.22s]  I got to be better than that.
[1240.22s -> 1244.08s]  All right, let's go.
[1244.08s -> 1248.44s]  Wait, I probably shouldn't have dropped down.
[1248.44s -> 1248.84s]  It's okay.
[1248.84s -> 1249.64s]  You're over 35.
[1249.64s -> 1251.74s]  Yeah, that's right.
[1251.74s -> 1253.74s]  What's the route to get over here?
[1253.74s -> 1264.84s]  Right across?
[1264.84s -> 1275.79s]  Oh, I don't...
[1275.79s -> 1278.11s]  What is this one?
[1278.11s -> 1285.66s]  Is this written down somewhere?
[1285.66s -> 1291.50s]  Let me get some brain fluid.
[1291.50s -> 1313.81s]  Okay.
[1313.81s -> 1314.31s]  Okay.
[1314.31s -> 1318.34s]  So, it's that one, that one.
[1318.34s -> 1320.38s]  But what order?
[1320.38s -> 1323.43s]  I don't remember this puzzle.
[1323.43s -> 1325.33s]  I seem to not remember anything from this game
[1325.33s -> 1326.63s]  because I keep saying that.
[1326.63s -> 1327.03s]  All right.
[1327.03s -> 1327.93s]  How do I know?
[1327.93s -> 1329.23s]  Do I just have to present any order
[1329.23s -> 1337.02s]  or just the ones that are shown?
[1337.02s -> 1337.52s]  Let me walk around.
[1337.52s -> 1337.72s]  All right.
[1337.72s -> 1340.14s]  So, this is like a circle of the line.
[1340.14s -> 1341.74s]  There's like a double...
[1341.74s -> 1345.62s]  Like a DNA thing.
[1345.62s -> 1351.18s]  There is a floating...
[1351.18s -> 1358.88s]  Whatever.
[1358.88s -> 1359.78s]  He's not remembering this?
[1359.78s -> 1361.24s]  No, I don't.
[1361.24s -> 1361.44s]  All right.
[1361.44s -> 1366.11s]  So, it's the circle on the line underneath the DNA symbol.
[1366.11s -> 1373.53s]  The two, like, Pisces, whatever it is.
[1373.53s -> 1389.30s]  Anything else?
[1389.30s -> 1396.26s]  It's really awesome meeting you at PAX East.
[1396.26s -> 1410.12s]  Somebody lied to you.
[1410.12s -> 1410.32s]  Okay.
[1410.32s -> 1428.48s]  Well, let me see if I can deduce it from that.
[1428.48s -> 1429.58s]  Was there any over here?
[1429.58s -> 1433.07s]  Let me just check.
[1433.07s -> 1435.47s]  Any other symbols besides those ones?
[1435.47s -> 1436.77s]  Or am I just overthinking this
[1436.77s -> 1441.50s]  and it actually is just so easy?
[1441.50s -> 1444.79s]  I'm probably overthinking this.
[1444.79s -> 1445.09s]  All right.
[1445.09s -> 1447.29s]  Then there's like the two birds.
[1447.29s -> 1448.09s]  That's four.
[1448.09s -> 1451.45s]  I think I got it.
[1451.45s -> 1454.96s]  Two birds.
[1454.96s -> 1462.42s]  So, we got this one.
[1462.42s -> 1464.40s]  Why can I not press it?
[1464.40s -> 1464.70s]  Okay.
[1464.70s -> 1467.72s]  No, it's this one.
[1467.72s -> 1472.12s]  Then this one.
[1472.12s -> 1473.72s]  This one.
[1473.72s -> 1478.72s]  Wait, what?
[1478.82s -> 1479.42s]  Does that mean a certain...
[1479.42s -> 1479.82s]  Wait.
[1479.82s -> 1485.97s]  Well, I couldn't do it.
[1485.97s -> 1493.90s]  Is it this one or this one?
[1493.90s -> 1497.70s]  Is it not this one?
[1497.70s -> 1498.40s]  No, I didn't want to do that.
[1498.40s -> 1505.97s]  Cancel.
[1505.97s -> 1511.65s]  That's not it.
[1511.65s -> 1518.45s]  This is going to take you 20 minutes.
[1518.45s -> 1519.25s]  Oh, this one had...
[1519.25s -> 1520.35s]  Okay, this one had that.
[1520.35s -> 1521.98s]  This one had that.
[1521.98s -> 1522.78s]  And this one had...
[1522.78s -> 1524.28s]  And this is correct.
[1524.28s -> 1528.93s]  Why?
[1528.93s -> 1529.83s]  It was like two...
[1529.83s -> 1532.09s]  The two bird ones.
[1532.09s -> 1538.72s]  Does that mean an order?
[1538.72s -> 1541.12s]  Because, I mean, this one was absolutely there.
[1541.12s -> 1545.75s]  This one was absolutely there.
[1545.75s -> 1546.45s]  I don't...
[1546.45s -> 1548.60s]  It was only one.
[1548.60s -> 1551.53s]  It was the circle of the line underneath it.
[1551.53s -> 1556.23s]  This one obviously doesn't count.
[1556.23s -> 1556.83s]  What's going on here?
[1556.83s -> 1569.00s]  What's going on here?
[1569.00s -> 1573.78s]  Check it again.
[1573.78s -> 1574.98s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[1574.98s -> 1576.28s]  This is one.
[1576.28s -> 1577.87s]  Okay.
[1577.87s -> 1582.04s]  So, this is just one of them.
[1582.04s -> 1584.64s]  So, it's this one.
[1584.64s -> 1587.54s]  And then this one.
[1587.54s -> 1589.58s]  And then this one.
[1589.58s -> 1590.18s]  Okay.
[1590.18s -> 1591.08s]  Okay.
[1591.08s -> 1592.85s]  I thought they were separate.
[1592.85s -> 1593.85s]  I was like, wait...
[1593.85s -> 1596.69s]  I thought this was just the double helix one.
[1596.69s -> 1597.09s]  We're good.
[1597.09s -> 1597.49s]  I just...
[1597.49s -> 1601.68s]  I got it.
[1601.68s -> 1613.24s]  I got a head.
[1613.24s -> 1616.77s]  Did you do a video of you fighting a bear?
[1616.77s -> 1617.47s]  No.
[1617.47s -> 1619.97s]  That would be incredibly dangerous.
[1628.70s -> 1630.20s]  You can't carry a grenade.
[1630.20s -> 1631.80s]  It's going to just explode on you.
[1631.80s -> 1649.38s]  What am I doing?
[1649.38s -> 1649.68s]  All right.
[1649.68s -> 1650.08s]  I'm just...
[1650.08s -> 1650.28s]  All right.
[1650.28s -> 1660.51s]  There's one of those things in this guy's head.
[1660.51s -> 1671.17s]  Almost out of bullets, by the way.
[1671.17s -> 1671.47s]  Cool.
[1671.47s -> 1672.07s]  Okay.
[1672.07s -> 1672.97s]  I got what I needed.
[1672.97s -> 1674.37s]  Time to go to the other one.
[1674.37s -> 1698.51s]  Oh, nice.
[1698.51s -> 1698.81s]  All right.
[1698.81s -> 1700.01s]  This is the...
[1700.01s -> 1704.82s]  This is going back.
[1704.82s -> 1705.52s]  I...
[1705.52s -> 1707.22s]  Hold on a second, though.
[1707.22s -> 1711.07s]  I want to explore.
[1711.07s -> 1711.87s]  I'm exploring.
[1711.87s -> 1721.40s]  Sorry.
[1721.40s -> 1722.30s]  There's a lot to explore.
[1722.30s -> 1723.30s]  Yes, there is.
[1723.30s -> 1731.95s]  Unfortunately, this...
[1731.95s -> 1733.45s]  Can this go in there?
[1733.45s -> 1735.05s]  Oh, it can.
[1736.94s -> 1739.44s]  It's a very big box for...
[1739.44s -> 1739.84s]  Wait.
[1739.84s -> 1741.48s]  There's other ones.
[1741.48s -> 1741.88s]  Does that work?
[1741.88s -> 1742.28s]  That works.
[1742.28s -> 1743.98s]  I'm going to go back to the other ones.
[1743.98s -> 1747.20s]  There's like two or three.
[1747.20s -> 1751.24s]  I'm going to try to remember what those are.
[1751.24s -> 1752.34s]  It was a 30-hour playthrough.
[1752.34s -> 1753.84s]  Now it's a hundred and...
[1753.84s -> 1754.24s]  You know what?
[1754.24s -> 1760.91s]  I played Elden Ring for a full straight month.
[1760.91s -> 1762.21s]  So it's all right.
[1762.21s -> 1763.11s]  I think I'm going to be...
[1763.11s -> 1766.34s]  I think I'll be fine.
[1766.34s -> 1772.92s]  That's all there is over here, though.
[1772.92s -> 1774.32s]  I'm not going to play this game for a month.
[1774.32s -> 1775.02s]  I'm just saying.
[1775.02s -> 1779.86s]  I'm taking my time.
[1779.86s -> 1781.16s]  It was definitely more than that.
[1781.16s -> 1787.22s]  It was probably like two months straight.
[1787.22s -> 1789.72s]  I...
[1789.72s -> 1791.38s]  Yeah, I want to...
[1791.38s -> 1798.28s]  I want to go back.
[1798.28s -> 1809.25s]  Maybe not right now, but eventually I want to go back to the other areas.
[1809.25s -> 1811.35s]  Bro, what are you doing?
[1811.35s -> 1816.48s]  Somebody just said that into their screen.
[1816.48s -> 1817.78s]  Their teeth, they were close.
[1817.78s -> 1823.86s]  What are you doing?
[1823.86s -> 1829.58s]  Relax.
[1829.58s -> 1832.96s]  All right.
[1832.96s -> 1834.76s]  Wait, I didn't get this.
[1834.76s -> 1837.03s]  What is that?
[1837.03s -> 1839.40s]  I got to check it.
[1839.40s -> 1839.70s]  I already...
[1839.70s -> 1841.00s]  I was just here, though.
[1841.00s -> 1842.10s]  Did I not get...
[1842.10s -> 1842.70s]  I'm confused.
[1842.70s -> 1850.17s]  How did I not see that?
[1850.17s -> 1860.83s]  Where is this?
[1860.83s -> 1862.27s]  Where is this?
[1862.27s -> 1869.76s]  Just past it.
[1869.76s -> 1870.36s]  Oh, is it there?
[1870.36s -> 1871.86s]  Is it that right there?
[1871.86s -> 1873.44s]  That's kind of weird.
[1873.44s -> 1875.99s]  I don't...
[1875.99s -> 1891.54s]  Is it really that?
[1891.54s -> 1893.79s]  Where is this thing?
[1893.79s -> 1899.33s]  I think it actually is that barrel.
[1899.33s -> 1903.29s]  My ceiling, ceiling, ceiling.
[1903.29s -> 1904.69s]  Oh, I thought that was a...
[1904.69s -> 1911.05s]  I thought that was a stalagmite.
[1911.05s -> 1916.73s]  Nice.
[1916.73s -> 1918.53s]  Bro just shot the rope.
[1918.53s -> 1919.03s]  I don't know.
[1919.03s -> 1921.26s]  I thought maybe it would...
[1921.26s -> 1924.63s]  I don't know.
[1924.63s -> 1925.87s]  Now we're good.
[1925.87s -> 1931.24s]  All that for a silver coin.
[1931.24s -> 1938.05s]  All right, I promise I'm going to move on.
[1938.05s -> 1941.29s]  We're going to continue through...
[1941.29s -> 1974.98s]  I'm going over here.
[1974.98s -> 1976.88s]  What are you doing?
[1976.88s -> 1983.42s]  What is he...
[1983.42s -> 1990.04s]  What is he doing?
[1990.04s -> 1992.72s]  He hates this chat.
[1992.72s -> 1997.20s]  No, you guys are fine.
[1997.20s -> 1998.10s]  Okay, we're good.
[1998.10s -> 1998.30s]  All right.
[1998.30s -> 1999.50s]  Now we're doing game progress.
[1999.50s -> 2002.98s]  Let's go.
[2002.98s -> 2009.56s]  What were they thinking?
[2009.56s -> 2010.99s]  All right.
[2010.99s -> 2018.86s]  So I need to put the head here
[2018.86s -> 2028.88s]  and I need to put something else there, which...
[2028.88s -> 2058.43s]  Oh, so he's got to go through the lake
[2058.43s -> 2068.41s]  and then just keep going.
[2068.41s -> 2072.90s]  Any other shit over here?
[2072.90s -> 2083.14s]  No, this is the boathouse.
[2083.14s -> 2093.22s]  Just check the outskirts.
[2093.22s -> 2095.12s]  Yep.
[2095.12s -> 2103.10s]  Let's go.
[2103.10s -> 2105.08s]  Check everything.
[2105.08s -> 2107.58s]  A lot of chickens here.
[2107.58s -> 2109.21s]  Ooh.
[2109.21s -> 2111.91s]  Wait, any golden eggs?
[2111.91s -> 2114.03s]  Any golden eggs?
[2114.03s -> 2114.33s]  I need it.
[2114.33s -> 2116.92s]  That's for a quest.
[2116.92s -> 2119.87s]  Oh, that's not a golden egg.
[2119.87s -> 2123.04s]  What do you have the golden egg?
[2123.04s -> 2126.04s]  Yep.
[2126.04s -> 2132.08s]  Gold chicken egg.
[2132.08s -> 2134.54s]  That's a quest.
[2134.54s -> 2136.72s]  Anything else here?
[2136.72s -> 2138.47s]  Oh, no.
[2138.47s -> 2140.81s]  Very good.
[2140.81s -> 2142.36s]  All right.
[2142.36s -> 2145.64s]  That's why we explore.
[2145.64s -> 2146.94s]  Got everything.
[2146.94s -> 2150.79s]  Now I'm going to go...
[2150.79s -> 2151.49s]  Oh, man.
[2151.49s -> 2153.54s]  Look at all this.
[2153.54s -> 2157.89s]  Look at all these fucking goodies.
[2157.89s -> 2163.13s]  I'm going over there.
[2163.13s -> 2172.78s]  What's this?
[2172.78s -> 2175.44s]  Oh, that's progress.
[2175.44s -> 2176.84s]  We're not doing game progress right now.
[2176.84s -> 2200.48s]  We're going to get goodies.
[2200.48s -> 2210.14s]  Anything over here?
[2210.14s -> 2213.14s]  Yeah, trinkets and all that stuff.
[2213.14s -> 2217.56s]  Okay, we're good.
[2217.56s -> 2218.66s]  This is the one and only time
[2218.66s -> 2219.96s]  you're going to see me walk around
[2219.96s -> 2224.17s]  in a circle collecting things.
[2224.17s -> 2228.22s]  Maybe one more time after this.
[2228.22s -> 2230.35s]  All right, let's go
[2230.35s -> 2248.18s]  clean out this place.
[2248.18s -> 2248.78s]  Block?
[2248.78s -> 2249.28s]  No.
[2249.28s -> 2250.48s]  Oh, God.
[2250.48s -> 2255.80s]  Shit.
[2255.80s -> 2268.05s]  It needs a regular key.
[2268.05s -> 2268.35s]  What?
[2268.35s -> 2297.15s]  You're alive.
[2297.15s -> 2298.75s]  This room feels booby trapped.
[2298.75s -> 2302.95s]  I don't think I want to go in here.
[2302.95s -> 2311.85s]  Do I have to shoot those?
[2311.85s -> 2315.44s]  Wait, I was already in here before.
[2315.44s -> 2318.97s]  Why are there more enemies now?
[2318.97s -> 2320.77s]  All right, this was one of those things
[2320.77s -> 2324.73s]  I know there was.
[2324.73s -> 2329.75s]  Where was it?
[2329.75s -> 2331.65s]  Did I bite my toenails?
[2331.65s -> 2336.54s]  No, I did not.
[2336.54s -> 2339.35s]  I don't bite my nails really either.
[2339.35s -> 2342.03s]  Not that I would bite my toenails,
[2342.03s -> 2343.03s]  but I don't bite my nails
[2343.03s -> 2345.57s]  because it kind of...
[2345.57s -> 2347.07s]  I always feel like it hurts
[2347.07s -> 2348.37s]  my teeth or something.
[2348.37s -> 2349.97s]  Like going like this would be like a bite.
[2349.97s -> 2353.37s]  Like it messes up my teeth.
[2353.37s -> 2358.68s]  It kind of hurts my teeth.
[2358.68s -> 2364.22s]  That's not very XQCL of you.
[2364.22s -> 2371.36s]  Yeah, there it is.
[2371.36s -> 2373.37s]  Nice.
[2373.37s -> 2376.62s]  Pearl bangle.
[2376.62s -> 2379.59s]  You have weak teeth?
[2379.59s -> 2382.96s]  Probably.
[2382.96s -> 2383.96s]  All right, I can't get that one,
[2383.96s -> 2390.50s]  but I can try these two.
[2390.50s -> 2397.72s]  Oh, I can open this.
[2397.72s -> 2402.29s]  Is this game progress?
[2402.29s -> 2404.79s]  I don't know, but I can go in here.
[2404.89s -> 2408.30s]  I thought game progress was going with the boat.
[2408.30s -> 2412.68s]  Apparently not.
[2412.68s -> 2420.06s]  Into the tunnel.
[2420.06s -> 2421.66s]  Someone catch me the gigantic fish
[2421.66s -> 2422.96s]  that lives in the lake for me.
[2422.96s -> 2425.02s]  Fish oil has many uses.
[2425.02s -> 2428.02s]  This photo should help you find it.
[2428.02s -> 2430.25s]  Oh, we're going back and doing that.
[2430.25s -> 2432.85s]  In front of the big shed thing.
[2432.85s -> 2436.92s]  Oh, yeah, let's get it.
[2436.92s -> 2437.62s]  Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[2437.62s -> 2443.61s]  Let's go get it.
[2443.61s -> 2444.81s]  There is something in here though.
[2444.81s -> 2450.29s]  Is it hanging? There it is.
[2450.29s -> 2456.25s]  Spinal.
[2456.25s -> 2462.52s]  Paper wolf.
[2463.82s -> 2466.00s]  Omega 3 Andy.
[2466.00s -> 2472.44s]  Very good for you.
[2472.44s -> 2481.12s]  There was one more and it's over here.
[2481.12s -> 2484.68s]  I want to go over here.
[2484.68s -> 2485.78s]  Where is it?
[2485.78s -> 2493.72s]  For the nest?
[2493.72s -> 2510.85s]  Right here.
[2510.85s -> 2512.19s]  Ooh.
[2512.19s -> 2516.37s]  All right, now let's go get the fish.
[2516.37s -> 2519.26s]  That's all I can do here for now.
[2519.26s -> 2521.00s]  Pretty sick.
[2521.00s -> 2526.85s]  All right, let's go get the fish.
[2526.85s -> 2529.77s]  Shoot the nest.
[2529.77s -> 2530.77s]  Shoot the nest, you dummy.
[2530.77s -> 2532.47s]  What do you mean?
[2532.47s -> 2538.05s]  Is that going to do something?
[2538.05s -> 2541.46s]  God, the backseaters today.
[2541.46s -> 2548.91s]  God, God.
[2548.91s -> 2550.21s]  All that for five handgun ammo
[2550.21s -> 2552.73s]  and I just destroyed a nest.
[2552.73s -> 2562.06s]  God, backseating today.
[2562.06s -> 2562.86s]  All right, let's go.
[2562.86s -> 2572.85s]  I want to get the fish.
[2572.85s -> 2573.55s]  You know what?
[2573.55s -> 2585.93s]  Mods, put it in no chat only today.
[2585.93s -> 2590.72s]  It would be so weird to scream without a chat.
[2590.72s -> 2593.71s]  I'll give you a little bit of inside info.
[2593.71s -> 2596.61s]  Back in the day making YouTube videos.
[2596.61s -> 2599.61s]  A lot of times I would just open up the game.
[2599.61s -> 2601.91s]  I would just kind of sit here like this
[2601.91s -> 2605.51s]  and I would be talking and making jokes
[2605.51s -> 2607.51s]  and trying to find funny things to do.
[2607.51s -> 2610.71s]  And it's so much easier to do this
[2610.71s -> 2614.01s]  with the people that you know are here right now.
[2614.01s -> 2616.81s]  I remember talking to nobody sometimes
[2616.81s -> 2618.61s]  and that's why I would always kind of be hanging out
[2618.61s -> 2620.51s]  on a call.
[2620.51s -> 2622.41s]  A lot of those old videos had, you know,
[2622.41s -> 2625.21s]  like stir, italics, boo, stealth.
[2625.21s -> 2626.61s]  We were kind of always just hanging out on a call
[2626.61s -> 2628.71s]  and she's like, all right, I'm just going to record.
[2628.71s -> 2630.31s]  A lot of times they would just be in the videos
[2630.31s -> 2632.41s]  because they were just in the call.
[2632.41s -> 2639.03s]  Which is, wait, what's in here?
[2639.03s -> 2640.13s]  Ooh, there's something else in here.
[2640.13s -> 2652.70s]  What's this?
[2652.70s -> 2657.23s]  Is this game progress?
[2657.23s -> 2660.12s]  No, there's something else in here.
[2660.12s -> 2666.83s]  Is it game progress?
[2666.83s -> 2675.89s]  All right, three squiggly lines.
[2675.89s -> 2677.26s]  Red herb.
[2677.26s -> 2682.45s]  All right, three squiggly lines.
[2682.45s -> 2688.17s]  P3, whatever that is.
[2688.17s -> 2692.31s]  And then the three fishes.
[2692.31s -> 2698.79s]  That's not going to help.
[2698.79s -> 2714.82s]  It's locked.
[2714.82s -> 2715.52s]  Where's P3?
[2715.52s -> 2719.55s]  Oh, there it is.
[2719.55s -> 2723.84s]  Ooh, it is game progress.
[2723.84s -> 2732.68s]  I needed one of those too.
[2732.68s -> 2734.28s]  I'm not going to pick that up yet because it's going to spawn
[2734.28s -> 2735.28s]  like 30 people.
[2735.28s -> 2739.06s]  So I'm not getting it yet.
[2739.06s -> 2753.18s]  Anything else I can get here?
[2753.18s -> 2757.61s]  I got everything besides the thing that's in the, wait,
[2757.61s -> 2762.80s]  what?
[2762.80s -> 2765.49s]  The other head.
[2765.49s -> 2769.28s]  Now get the key to the church.
[2769.28s -> 2775.32s]  There's still something behind me.
[2775.32s -> 2787.13s]  Hanging?
[2787.13s -> 2788.43s]  Very nice.
[2788.43s -> 2790.24s]  All righty.
[2790.24s -> 2792.62s]  It's time.
[2792.62s -> 2799.82s]  It is now time to, I'm not going to go back this way.
[2799.82s -> 2802.02s]  I'm going to go over here because I want to go.
[2802.02s -> 2803.62s]  Where was that other?
[2803.62s -> 2806.58s]  It was over here, wasn't it?
[2806.58s -> 2808.55s]  Where I could go.
[2808.55s -> 2814.35s]  I could go down.
[2814.35s -> 2815.35s]  Where was that part that I was at?
[2815.35s -> 2816.25s]  Oh, is this game progress?
[2816.25s -> 2823.65s]  It was up here, wasn't it?
[2823.65s -> 2824.55s]  I need the shed.
[2824.55s -> 2828.39s]  Yep.
[2828.39s -> 2832.37s]  Bang, all right.
[2832.37s -> 2835.57s]  All right, fish.
[2835.57s -> 2844.35s]  I think the fish is over here.
[2844.35s -> 2849.92s]  Move that like shed.
[2849.92s -> 2866.76s]  There it is.
[2866.76s -> 2871.90s]  There it is.
[2871.90s -> 2884.18s]  There's it.
[2884.18s -> 2885.48s]  Uh-oh.
[2885.48s -> 2887.94s]  It's a little too big.
[2887.94s -> 2942.02s]  Um, I already did this, right?
[2942.02s -> 2945.98s]  How big is this fish?
[2945.98s -> 2948.99s]  I think that's big enough, right?
[2948.99s -> 2952.02s]  All right, cool.
[2952.02s -> 2954.62s]  A rare Lunker size bass measuring over 18 inches
[2954.62s -> 2956.02s]  can be sold at a high price or used.
[2956.02s -> 2958.12s]  And is that the, that's the right one, right?
[2958.12s -> 2963.00s]  Okay, yeah, let's go.
[2963.00s -> 2976.10s]  Let me go do this.
[2976.10s -> 2978.66s]  What was over here?
[2978.66s -> 2991.88s]  Was it just a chest, a regular chest?
[2991.88s -> 3001.67s]  I need to go back to the merchant.
[3001.67s -> 3004.71s]  Need to go do the hexagon puzzle.
[3004.71s -> 3008.84s]  Yeah, that was pretty early on, wasn't it?
[3008.94s -> 3021.78s]  Okay, now I got to go right.
[3021.78s -> 3024.18s]  I go down.
[3024.18s -> 3039.52s]  Because this is, jeez.
[3039.52s -> 3046.30s]  What the hell is going on here?
[3046.30s -> 3047.70s]  I was trying to do the jump scare
[3047.70s -> 3050.94s]  and then have it get jump scared like three seconds later.
[3050.94s -> 3052.94s]  Like I, I don't know, like I had lag on my computer
[3052.94s -> 3058.08s]  or you had lag to your computer.
[3058.08s -> 3058.98s]  This is wicked funny.
[3058.98s -> 3077.00s]  You just didn't get to see it.
[3077.00s -> 3080.62s]  Oh, this is a key.
[3080.62s -> 3082.82s]  I can go open up a drawer now.
[3082.82s -> 3087.24s]  All right, I, I love doing this.
[3087.24s -> 3088.74s]  I, yeah, I'm having fun.
[3088.74s -> 3094.37s]  I don't care.
[3094.37s -> 3098.88s]  Now I got to go open up one of those drawers
[3098.88s -> 3100.28s]  and that's all that's here.
[3100.28s -> 3101.68s]  Any other things to do?
[3101.68s -> 3102.58s]  Nope.
[3102.58s -> 3126.76s]  What the fuck is that?
[3126.76s -> 3139.62s]  No, honestly, like what is that?
[3139.62s -> 3152.07s]  Why is the predator out here?
[3152.07s -> 3166.62s]  Great.
[3166.62s -> 3168.42s]  What the hell?
[3168.42s -> 3169.42s]  What button?
[3169.42s -> 3172.42s]  I just pressed every button on my keyboard.
[3172.42s -> 3176.50s]  It's V.
[3176.50s -> 3177.90s]  Oh no.
[3177.90s -> 3179.98s]  No way.
[3179.98s -> 3183.98s]  See ya.
[3183.98s -> 3201.65s]  No, it don't even.
[3201.65s -> 3205.63s]  Oh.
[3205.63s -> 3210.52s]  Oops.
[3210.52s -> 3222.08s]  Okay, we're good.
[3222.08s -> 3227.26s]  All right, there is a draw in here.
[3227.26s -> 3234.78s]  Let's go open it.
[3234.78s -> 3236.02s]  Where, right here, right?
[3236.02s -> 3242.87s]  All right, what do we get?
[3242.87s -> 3245.10s]  I got a gold bar.
[3245.10s -> 3247.61s]  This is a, how much this is worth?
[3247.61s -> 3248.21s]  Where is it?
[3248.21s -> 3255.90s]  A gold bar?
[3255.90s -> 3259.17s]  It's 10,000.
[3259.17s -> 3261.11s]  I got a lot of money.
[3261.11s -> 3263.94s]  I need more of these jewels though.
[3263.94s -> 3267.43s]  The rectangle ones.
[3267.43s -> 3274.29s]  So I can do this now.
[3274.29s -> 3278.94s]  $46,000.
[3278.94s -> 3284.82s]  This thing is, I'm going to be able to buy something ridiculous.
[3284.82s -> 3287.10s]  Very cool.
[3287.10s -> 3288.30s]  I need more of these.
[3288.30s -> 3291.15s]  I found tons of these, but not a lot of these.
[3291.15s -> 3293.60s]  Now I will sell this.
[3293.60s -> 3295.43s]  I'm going to make a lot of money.
[3295.43s -> 3296.43s]  Okay, very cool.
[3296.43s -> 3299.04s]  Good.
[3299.04s -> 3300.33s]  Worth it.
[3300.33s -> 3302.61s]  Glad I came back here.
[3302.61s -> 3305.31s]  Now we're going to go to the merchant.
[3305.31s -> 3308.84s]  Because I have to turn in a bunch of shit and I want to make sure I get.
[3308.84s -> 3312.25s]  What is going on up here?
[3312.25s -> 3314.25s]  I didn't get, that's gunpowder?
[3314.25s -> 3319.26s]  I got to get it.
[3319.26s -> 3325.76s]  How did I miss this?
[3325.76s -> 3326.76s]  Remember, it's a Resident Evil game.
[3326.76s -> 3328.76s]  You have to pick up everything.
[3328.76s -> 3340.37s]  Everything must be picked up.
[3340.37s -> 3340.67s]  Okay.
[3340.67s -> 3342.84s]  Got everything.
[3342.84s -> 3343.84s]  Very good.
[3343.84s -> 3344.84s]  Very cool.
[3344.84s -> 3345.44s]  So happy.
[3345.44s -> 3349.22s]  I'm excited.
[3349.22s -> 3363.90s]  I had to go put like $70,000 into one gun.
[3363.90s -> 3375.15s]  Think that the merchant is down here.
[3375.15s -> 3375.45s]  Here.
[3375.45s -> 3375.65s]  All right.
[3375.65s -> 3390.88s]  That's going to go straight.
[3390.88s -> 3392.08s]  Take the boat east.
[3392.08s -> 3405.14s]  You can find a McDonald's.
[3405.14s -> 3410.91s]  I wonder if they'll be, should I go to the merchant or will there be one like right here?
[3410.91s -> 3412.01s]  There's one right across.
[3412.01s -> 3412.91s]  Yeah, just go.
[3412.91s -> 3417.80s]  I'm going to be mad that if I don't.
[3417.80s -> 3419.70s]  Can we please go?
[3419.70s -> 3437.39s]  This area is very important to explore.
[3437.39s -> 3439.49s]  Maybe I should have used the key here, but I got a gold bar.
[3439.49s -> 3441.76s]  I'm happy.
[3441.76s -> 3442.06s]  All right.
[3442.06s -> 3443.86s]  Turn in the quests.
[3443.86s -> 3445.96s]  Sell a bunch of shit.
[3445.96s -> 3447.26s]  Welcome.
[3447.26s -> 3453.10s]  I've got something new for you.
[3453.20s -> 3462.41s]  Where's the um, how come I didn't get the turn in?
[3462.41s -> 3464.91s]  Oh, sell a Lunker bass.
[3464.91s -> 3467.85s]  Okay.
[3467.85s -> 3469.15s]  I need to sell the Lunker.
[3469.15s -> 3469.65s]  Sell the egg.
[3469.65s -> 3477.29s]  Welcome.
[3477.29s -> 3479.33s]  Anything perfect.
[3479.33s -> 3481.33s]  You're a real professional.
[3481.33s -> 3484.93s]  A job well done deserves payment in kind.
[3484.93s -> 3486.93s]  Will that be all then?
[3486.93s -> 3487.63s]  All right.
[3487.63s -> 3488.43s]  Pearl bangle.
[3488.43s -> 3490.13s]  This is just for selling only.
[3490.13s -> 3492.93s]  Rubies or bar makes no difference.
[3492.93s -> 3494.53s]  The price is just for selling.
[3494.53s -> 3494.93s]  Cool.
[3494.93s -> 3497.43s]  That's our choice to make.
[3497.43s -> 3500.93s]  Seventy three thousand and this key is done, right?
[3500.93s -> 3506.29s]  This is a done key.
[3506.29s -> 3506.89s]  Nice.
[3506.89s -> 3507.29s]  All right.
[3507.29s -> 3511.82s]  This is like seventy five thousand.
[3511.82s -> 3512.62s]  Thank you.
[3512.62s -> 3518.83s]  Got a selection of good things on sale stranger.
[3518.83s -> 3521.13s]  Why not try your hand?
[3521.13s -> 3527.26s]  I'm going to buy the rocket launcher.
[3527.26s -> 3529.66s]  I'm not buying the rocket launcher.
[3529.66s -> 3539.99s]  I should probably get this because I have the.
[3539.99s -> 3545.82s]  Crossbow.
[3545.82s -> 3549.80s]  It's twenty percent off.
[3549.80s -> 3551.20s]  Knowledge is power.
[3551.20s -> 3553.00s]  Case upgrade is just important.
[3553.00s -> 3555.40s]  I'm getting it.
[3555.40s -> 3555.60s]  All right.
[3555.60s -> 3559.87s]  Now hold on.
[3559.87s -> 3567.18s]  I don't think I really care about the rifle.
[3567.18s -> 3570.48s]  That cash in your pocket or your life.
[3570.48s -> 3572.88s]  What else do you got?
[3572.88s -> 3575.38s]  Anything else?
[3575.38s -> 3576.58s]  What's that?
[3576.58s -> 3583.42s]  Have we procured eight curiosities?
[3583.42s -> 3586.82s]  Increase the drop rate of resources large elegant mask.
[3586.82s -> 3588.85s]  Oh, yeah.
[3588.85s -> 3589.75s]  I'm getting the mask.
[3589.75s -> 3593.21s]  You can't go wrong.
[3593.21s -> 3597.08s]  I'm getting the Punisher.
[3597.08s -> 3597.88s]  No, no, no, no.
[3597.88s -> 3602.25s]  Get the map to don't already have it.
[3602.25s -> 3604.81s]  I guess I get is it going to help?
[3604.81s -> 3606.21s]  Treasure.
[3606.21s -> 3608.21s]  I'm going to get one of these two.
[3608.21s -> 3610.65s]  All right.
[3610.65s -> 3611.05s]  Now hold on.
[3611.05s -> 3615.45s]  Hold on a second.
[3615.45s -> 3619.32s]  I could do three reds in this right now.
[3619.32s -> 3621.32s]  Is that better than we'll find out?
[3621.32s -> 3629.24s]  All right.
[3629.24s -> 3633.14s]  Triple Reds is one point four times nineteen six.
[3637.17s -> 3643.12s]  What about three?
[3643.12s -> 3644.12s]  Way more.
[3644.12s -> 3647.23s]  Twenty four seven.
[3647.23s -> 3647.63s]  All right.
[3647.63s -> 3652.93s]  Put those in.
[3652.93s -> 3653.43s]  All right.
[3653.43s -> 3654.23s]  Sell this.
[3654.23s -> 3655.53s]  Welcome.
[3655.53s -> 3656.43s]  Where would it?
[3656.43s -> 3660.54s]  What can I do you for a deal?
[3660.54s -> 3666.45s]  Well, don't get yourself killed here.
[3666.45s -> 3672.79s]  I'm going to put this in here.
[3672.79s -> 3674.39s]  A ton of money.
[3674.39s -> 3682.44s]  Now, what do I want?
[3682.44s -> 3683.74s]  Fix the knife.
[3683.74s -> 3684.64s]  Good luck to you.
[3684.64s -> 3685.14s]  Strange.
[3685.14s -> 3689.44s]  I think I'm doing durability on the knife and I'm doing.
[3689.44s -> 3692.84s]  Yeah, it sucks when you don't have it.
[3692.84s -> 3693.34s]  I got tons of money.
[3693.34s -> 3698.74s]  I'm fine.
[3698.74s -> 3699.44s]  Dirty.
[3699.44s -> 3703.04s]  Yeah, this kind of work is about finesse.
[3703.04s -> 3704.34s]  Strange.
[3704.34s -> 3707.14s]  Little bit goes a long way.
[3707.14s -> 3709.49s]  You'll see.
[3709.49s -> 3711.59s]  See how that feels.
[3711.59s -> 3717.63s]  Better like yourself should notice the difference right away.
[3717.63s -> 3720.33s]  Dazzled are you?
[3720.33s -> 3724.80s]  Our craftsmanship demands.
[3724.80s -> 3725.40s]  All right.
[3725.40s -> 3725.70s]  All right.
[3725.70s -> 3727.30s]  Slow down.
[3727.30s -> 3729.10s]  Slow down.
[3729.10s -> 3730.20s]  I am.
[3730.20s -> 3737.29s]  I am disgusting right now.
[3737.29s -> 3738.99s]  Killing me.
[3738.99s -> 3740.99s]  You come back any time.
[3740.99s -> 3742.79s]  How come you're not using the rocket launcher?
[3742.79s -> 3747.39s]  Because the rocket launcher is going to sit in the storage box until the last encounter
[3747.39s -> 3750.59s]  and I'm going to take it out and I'm going to have three shots for it.
[3750.59s -> 3753.19s]  I'm going to miss the first one.
[3753.19s -> 3755.59s]  It's going to right by the boss's head.
[3755.59s -> 3757.59s]  I'm going to scream and be pissed.
[3757.69s -> 3758.89s]  I'm going to shoot one more time.
[3758.89s -> 3759.89s]  It's going to hit the chest.
[3759.89s -> 3761.19s]  Boom, big explosion.
[3761.19s -> 3761.69s]  Do it again.
[3761.69s -> 3762.99s]  Boom, big explosion.
[3762.99s -> 3767.71s]  And then I'm going to have to take out every magazine and every clip anyways of every weapon
[3767.71s -> 3769.53s]  to beat it anyways.
[3769.53s -> 3784.85s]  So no, I think I'm going to put this one back on.
[3784.85s -> 3786.95s]  I want because my handgun is the best thing I have.
[3786.95s -> 3787.95s]  I want more ammo for it.
[3787.95s -> 3799.77s]  I'm running kind of low.
[3799.77s -> 3806.61s]  I could make another three bolts, but do I really care?
[3806.61s -> 3807.91s]  Let's do this.
[3807.91s -> 3814.41s]  Then I need a yellow and we're good.
[3814.41s -> 3829.60s]  What's the case look like now?
[3829.60s -> 3831.66s]  I'm happy with it so far.
[3831.66s -> 3835.78s]  I'm happy.
[3835.78s -> 3837.68s]  I do want to get another shotgun eventually though.
[3837.68s -> 3840.48s]  Shotguns are so good in these games.
[3840.48s -> 3842.95s]  Cool.
[3842.95s -> 3843.65s]  All right.
[3843.65s -> 3845.85s]  I am ready to progress the game.
[3845.85s -> 3847.81s]  It's time to do it.
[3847.81s -> 3849.56s]  Finally.
[3849.56s -> 3860.76s]  So in the boat, straight right.
[3860.76s -> 3877.64s]  There it is.
[3877.64s -> 3879.34s]  Bro Twitch didn't notify.
[3879.34s -> 3879.94s]  Oh shit.
[3879.94s -> 3892.90s]  I'm sorry about that.
[3892.90s -> 3895.92s]  Okay.
[3895.92s -> 3897.92s]  I have that hexagon puzzle too though.
[3897.92s -> 3902.05s]  Where was that?
[3902.05s -> 3903.25s]  Church insignia.
[3903.25s -> 3905.45s]  I got to go back to the church.
[3905.45s -> 3907.95s]  That just something is wrong with my video card.
[3907.95s -> 3909.35s]  Condor one to roost.
[3909.35s -> 3911.05s]  I found the key to the church.
[3911.05s -> 3912.15s]  Copy that.
[3912.15s -> 3914.03s]  Now go get baby eagle.
[3914.03s -> 3914.73s]  Right.
[3914.73s -> 3916.03s]  No time to chat.
[3916.03s -> 3927.03s]  I'm going in condor one out by the fishing farm.
[3927.03s -> 3933.20s]  I got to go back here.
[3933.20s -> 3934.30s]  Bang a left down here.
[3934.30s -> 3940.60s]  And then wait, how do I get back there fish farm?
[3940.60s -> 3943.10s]  Here it is.
[3943.10s -> 3945.78s]  I need to go here.
[3945.78s -> 3959.27s]  Okay, so I got to go to this way.
[3959.27s -> 3960.37s]  I missed some treasures.
[3960.37s -> 3961.47s]  Yeah, I did.
[3961.47s -> 3966.80s]  It's okay though.
[3966.80s -> 3974.68s]  Can't get everything.
[3974.68s -> 3977.92s]  Where did I just come out?
[3977.92s -> 3995.45s]  Interesting.
[3995.45s -> 3999.68s]  I'm going the wrong way.
[3999.68s -> 4002.44s]  I got to go back to the boat.
[4002.44s -> 4006.33s]  Why did they dump me out here?
[4006.33s -> 4017.03s]  I guess I could have not gone this way.
[4017.03s -> 4018.13s]  Am I going to stream today?
[4018.13s -> 4019.70s]  I was thinking about it.
[4019.70s -> 4021.84s]  It depends.
[4021.84s -> 4026.55s]  I was going to start at like 8 or 9 p.m. Pacific again.
[4026.55s -> 4034.37s]  I haven't pressed the button yet though.
[4034.37s -> 4036.63s]  I hope you do stream today.
[4036.63s -> 4037.43s]  Eh, I don't know.
[4037.43s -> 4039.73s]  I'm not really feeling it today.
[4039.73s -> 4041.03s]  So probably not.
[4041.13s -> 4059.96s]  Maybe like in a few days or something.
[4059.96s -> 4067.16s]  All right, I need to go here.
[4067.16s -> 4072.53s]  I'm going the wrong way again.
[4072.53s -> 4080.98s]  I'm so bad with directions.
[4080.98s -> 4083.68s]  Wait, didn't I just, hold on.
[4083.68s -> 4085.68s]  All right, I can't look over at chat for a minute.
[4085.68s -> 4087.98s]  I need to, it's over here, right?
[4087.98s -> 4089.88s]  Because this is connecting.
[4089.88s -> 4091.38s]  Now it's back where the merchant is.
[4091.38s -> 4094.31s]  Back where the merchant is, back where the merchant is.
[4094.31s -> 4100.13s]  I don't know what the fuck I was doing.
[4100.13s -> 4103.95s]  Wait, is it actually, can I actually go from here?
[4103.95s -> 4104.95s]  Why am I looking over here?
[4104.95s -> 4106.45s]  I just said I wasn't going to do that.
[4106.45s -> 4107.75s]  Because I like, I'm in the game,
[4107.75s -> 4109.65s]  and then I take myself out of the game.
[4109.65s -> 4112.05s]  And then I just hold W, and I'm still,
[4112.05s -> 4117.98s]  I'm going in a complete, and then I'm like, where am I?
[4117.98s -> 4127.76s]  I gotta stop looking over here.
[4127.76s -> 4132.23s]  I found it.
[4132.23s -> 4144.00s]  Stop looking over there.
[4144.00s -> 4168.88s]  Stop!
[4168.88s -> 4170.48s]  This is like doing a Rubik's Cube.
[4170.48s -> 4217.73s]  Shit, I gotta bring this up, the whole thing.
[4217.73s -> 4264.73s]  This shit's fucking hard.
[4264.73s -> 4269.16s]  I wish I could move the, all the top left.
[4269.16s -> 4283.74s]  I can't.
[4283.74s -> 4287.99s]  You could have done this in like four turns.
[4287.99s -> 4291.30s]  You know, here's the thing, everybody.
[4291.30s -> 4292.90s]  Some of you are good at puzzles.
[4293.00s -> 4294.60s]  Some of you are very strong.
[4294.60s -> 4295.80s]  Some of you are very smart.
[4295.80s -> 4297.20s]  Some of you are very funny.
[4297.20s -> 4299.80s]  Some of you are very, some of you are very fast.
[4299.80s -> 4301.60s]  Some of you are very slow.
[4301.60s -> 4303.10s]  Some of you are slow and strong,
[4303.10s -> 4306.40s]  and, and we're all different, okay?
[4306.40s -> 4308.50s]  We're all different people.
[4308.50s -> 4310.90s]  I'm not very good at puzzles,
[4310.90s -> 4312.80s]  but I do other stuff pretty good.
[4312.80s -> 4314.20s]  We're all different people.
[4314.20s -> 4316.10s]  Some of you are really good at this kind of shit,
[4316.10s -> 4317.60s]  but it's good.
[4317.60s -> 4319.00s]  I'm glad that you are.
[4319.00s -> 4320.30s]  Not me.
[4320.30s -> 4321.50s]  Not me, if I could do that though,
[4321.50s -> 4323.50s]  oh, you didn't see me, did you?
[4323.50s -> 4335.99s]  This hurt my ankle.
[4335.99s -> 4428.67s]  Maybe if I do it with one eye.
[4428.67s -> 4430.47s]  I fucking can't do this shit.
[4430.47s -> 4432.27s]  I hate these more than anything.
[4432.27s -> 4435.34s]  I hate these more than anything.
[4435.34s -> 4438.07s]  You want people to go, I can't, why can he not do this?
[4438.07s -> 4440.37s]  Every time I've ever seen a puzzle like this,
[4440.37s -> 4441.57s]  I don't do it.
[4441.57s -> 4444.27s]  I just don't, and where would I do these, by the way?
[4444.27s -> 4445.27s]  It's not, it's not like in the,
[4445.27s -> 4447.75s]  this is not like the Sunday fucking comics.
[4447.75s -> 4449.85s]  It's not like, oh yeah, let me do the fucking weird
[4449.85s -> 4452.95s]  three triangle slide puzzle today.
[4453.05s -> 4454.65s]  I've, where do you do these,
[4454.65s -> 4457.83s]  if not only in Resident Evil 4?
[4457.83s -> 4459.63s]  I've, this is the only time I've ever,
[4459.63s -> 4461.37s]  I don't do Rubik's Cube.
[4461.37s -> 4462.47s]  If you give me a Rubik's Cube,
[4462.47s -> 4463.87s]  I'm gonna go fuck this, man.
[4463.87s -> 4466.27s]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm not gonna do this.
[4466.27s -> 4467.17s]  Somebody else do it.
[4467.17s -> 4468.37s]  I'm not doing this.
[4468.37s -> 4473.32s]  It's only, these are only in Resident Evil.
[4473.32s -> 4474.32s]  I've never completed,
[4474.32s -> 4476.52s]  I've gone like this with a Rubik's Cube.
[4476.52s -> 4478.32s]  Oh, there's green on the top,
[4478.32s -> 4481.06s]  and there's yellow down there.
[4481.06s -> 4483.10s]  I got one row.
[4483.10s -> 4485.30s]  It's gone, I don't, into the trash.
[4485.30s -> 4487.20s]  Well, not into the trash, into the, you know,
[4487.20s -> 4488.60s]  on the shelf somewhere.
[4488.60s -> 4490.00s]  But you get, all right, all right.
[4490.00s -> 4492.95s]  Everyone stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[4492.95s -> 4523.28s]  Why would I buy a Rubik's Cube to throw it in the trash?
[4523.28s -> 4524.18s]  Fuck you!
[4541.94s -> 4567.41s]  I wanna move these ones on the top right.
[4567.41s -> 4568.91s]  Hey, this needs to be on the bottom.
[4568.91s -> 4571.41s]  How do you get it to be that way?
[4571.41s -> 4572.91s]  No, this has to, this is, it's on the top.
[4572.91s -> 4574.31s]  This has to go on the top.
[4574.31s -> 4575.91s]  Those ones up there are the bottom.
[4575.91s -> 4577.31s]  I don't fucking know, guys.
[4577.31s -> 4579.90s]  I don't care.
[4579.90s -> 4586.73s]  Is this the bottom?
[4586.73s -> 4587.57s]  No, it's not.
[4587.57s -> 4589.27s]  It's the right side?
[4589.27s -> 4595.10s]  What side is that shit?
[4595.10s -> 4595.94s]  Get me in there!
[4595.94s -> 4597.40s]  I don't care, shoot it open!
[4597.40s -> 4600.60s]  Give me a crowbar, I'll get in there in one minute.
[4600.60s -> 4603.81s]  Give me a crowbar, I'm in here in less than 30 seconds.
[4603.81s -> 4604.65s]  I'll just,
[4606.81s -> 4607.81s]  and open it.
[4607.81s -> 4626.30s]  Give me a crowbar, I'll get in there in one minute.
[4626.30s -> 4629.84s]  All right, so that's, this is the right,
[4629.84s -> 4632.34s]  this has to go over to the right.
[4632.34s -> 4634.04s]  It's because it's all circles and shit.
[4634.04s -> 4636.24s]  I can't do it.
[4636.24s -> 4638.24s]  My four-year-old got this in six minutes.
[4638.24s -> 4641.44s]  You're a bad parent for letting your four-year-old
[4641.44s -> 4674.97s]  play Resident Evil 4, there's blood and guts in this.
[4674.97s -> 4676.77s]  2020 Jerma would have gotten this, no.
[4676.77s -> 4679.67s]  2020 Jerma would have stopped playing Resident Evil 4
[4679.67s -> 4684.90s]  after the first stream, and you know that's accurate.
[4684.90s -> 4688.10s]  Yeah, oh yeah, 2017 Jerma, no, 2017 Jerma
[4688.10s -> 4692.00s]  would have played Resident Evil 3, 4, for three hours,
[4692.00s -> 4695.81s]  and then played a different game the next day.
[4695.81s -> 4705.19s]  He was so, he was so much smarter than me.
[4705.19s -> 4707.49s]  Yeah, 2018 Jerma would not have been,
[4707.49s -> 4709.91s]  not even gotten this far.
[4709.91s -> 4712.01s]  2018 Jerma would have thrown a grenade into the wall,
[4712.01s -> 4713.81s]  it would have bounced back and blown me up,
[4713.81s -> 4719.98s]  and I would have uninstalled the game.
[4719.98s -> 4776.42s]  All right, I'm not looking at chat for the next 10 minutes.
[4776.42s -> 4783.58s]  Bro, I don't think I can do it.
[4783.58s -> 4789.40s]  There's that side, but like, but it's,
[4789.40s -> 4791.90s]  this is the Rubik's Cube dog shit,
[4791.90s -> 4794.30s]  where if you get one side all red,
[4794.30s -> 4796.90s]  it's like hooray, I got all this one side red.
[4796.90s -> 4798.20s]  That doesn't matter at all,
[4798.20s -> 4800.40s]  because all the other sides are wrong.
[4800.40s -> 4803.10s]  So it doesn't matter if you got one side right.
[4803.10s -> 4804.10s]  You've got to read through the whole thing,
[4804.10s -> 4806.60s]  because everything has to line up exactly, perfectly,
[4806.60s -> 4811.02s]  at the very end.
[4811.02s -> 4849.00s]  Okay, piece of shit.
[4849.00s -> 4850.84s]  Is this even right?
[4850.84s -> 4866.81s]  No, it is.
[4866.81s -> 4869.70s]  He's regressing.
[4869.70s -> 4874.76s]  Dude, puzzles like this, no, nobody does these.
[4874.76s -> 4877.86s]  Well, I ain't getting into the magical fucking fortress.
[4877.86s -> 4882.55s]  Good for you, Resident Evil 4 villains.
[4882.55s -> 4885.25s]  Put these in front of your door.
[4885.25s -> 4887.75s]  You know what, forget about locks.
[4887.75s -> 4889.65s]  You don't, get rid of keys.
[4889.65s -> 4892.55s]  You want to make it so nobody gets into your fucking house?
[4892.55s -> 4895.15s]  No more keys that you can lockpick and shit.
[4895.15s -> 4897.45s]  No, no, no, put one of these on your front door.
[4897.45s -> 4899.65s]  I ain't nobody getting in.
[4899.65s -> 4901.55s]  Ain't nobody going to get in.
[4901.55s -> 4903.25s]  Do one of these to get into your house,
[4903.25s -> 4905.85s]  to get into your front door, to get into your fortress.
[4905.85s -> 4907.65s]  No one's getting in.
[4907.65s -> 4921.47s]  This is way more secure than a lock with a key.
[4921.47s -> 4922.77s]  What if you forgot the solution
[4922.77s -> 4928.45s]  and you locked yourself out of the house?
[4928.45s -> 4930.45s]  I'm just imagining somebody, I don't know why,
[4930.45s -> 4932.25s]  but a bunch of fishing equipment.
[4932.35s -> 4936.32s]  A fishing hat, two free fishing poles, a tackle box,
[4936.32s -> 4938.52s]  a big box of bait and stuff,
[4938.52s -> 4940.72s]  and they're like, what the fuck is happening?
[4943.77s -> 4945.37s]  You can't get in the house?
[4945.37s -> 4947.37s]  Come on, let me try.
[4947.37s -> 4949.17s]  It's like, yeah, just, I don't know.
[4949.17s -> 4950.77s]  You put this on here, shut up.
[4950.77s -> 4952.61s]  Hold on a minute.
[4952.61s -> 4953.51s]  No, no, it's the other way.
[4953.51s -> 4955.31s]  You screwed it all up.
[4955.31s -> 4957.81s]  Ah, shit, we're going to get a locksmith.
[4957.81s -> 4959.61s]  The locksmith shows up.
[4959.61s -> 4960.81s]  It's like, I don't, bro,
[4960.81s -> 4962.71s]  I don't know how to fucking get in your house.
[4962.71s -> 4967.28s]  I don't know how to get in here.
[4967.28s -> 4969.58s]  You're going to have to use like fucking C4
[4969.58s -> 4971.88s]  to get into your front door.
[4971.88s -> 4973.88s]  Someone's going to have to use a battering ram
[4973.88s -> 4983.23s]  to knock your door in.
[4983.23s -> 4984.73s]  I'm so fucked here.
[4984.73s -> 4986.63s]  Okay, I know I have to focus.
[4986.63s -> 4989.24s]  I know, I know.
[4989.24s -> 4990.84s]  There's a lot of people that don't like these
[4990.84s -> 4991.68s]  and I'm one of them.
[4991.68s -> 4994.34s]  And I know that some of you are one of them too.
[4994.34s -> 4997.97s]  Okay, you guys have to help me.
[4997.97s -> 4998.81s]  You guys have to help me.
[4998.81s -> 5000.17s]  I actually, I'm having a lot of trouble.
[5000.17s -> 5001.57s]  You have to help me.
[5001.57s -> 5007.48s]  I want to ask if we get one's in the chat.
[5007.48s -> 5009.58s]  Hey guys, I can't get in my house.
[5009.58s -> 5016.08s]  One's in the chat if I should rotate this.
[5016.08s -> 5019.62s]  I can't turn on click math.
[5019.62s -> 5022.02s]  A walkthrough is actually not helpful either
[5022.02s -> 5027.64s]  because I already fucked it all up and I can't reset it.
[5027.64s -> 5035.82s]  All right, do I spin this one?
[5035.82s -> 5043.66s]  Okay, everybody stop talking.
[5043.66s -> 5045.26s]  Do I spin this one again?
[5052.57s -> 5056.05s]  No, okay, all right, all right, all right.
[5056.05s -> 5064.88s]  Do I spin this one?
[5064.88s -> 5069.65s]  Yes, spin this one twice.
[5069.65s -> 5074.98s]  Okay, do I spin this one?
[5074.98s -> 5079.93s]  This must be humiliating.
[5079.93s -> 5081.03s]  No, not really.
[5081.03s -> 5083.83s]  I just don't do, I'm not like a puzzle guy.
[5083.83s -> 5089.56s]  I'm just not, I don't care.
[5089.56s -> 5091.76s]  I'm not a, but dude, it's such an easy puzzle.
[5091.76s -> 5096.82s]  Maybe for you, but my brain, when I turn this,
[5096.82s -> 5101.82s]  it's like, it's like when fucking, what's his name?
[5101.82s -> 5104.72s]  The weird, weird, Doctor Strange.
[5104.72s -> 5105.82s]  When Doctor Strange is in,
[5105.82s -> 5108.22s]  they're seeing every fucking timeline
[5108.22s -> 5111.82s]  and he's like, when I spin this,
[5111.82s -> 5113.32s]  I see every possibility.
[5113.32s -> 5115.42s]  My brain's like, dude, just walk away.
[5116.50s -> 5118.80s]  All right, spin this one?
[5118.80s -> 5125.61s]  Doctor weird.
[5125.61s -> 5131.20s]  Just spin this one.
[5131.20s -> 5133.20s]  Dude, I need somebody to help me.
[5133.20s -> 5139.81s]  I need somebody to help me.
[5139.81s -> 5141.95s]  I'm fast as fuck though.
[5141.95s -> 5143.65s]  I guarantee you if I had a crowbar,
[5143.65s -> 5145.35s]  I would solve half the problems.
[5145.35s -> 5148.35s]  I could solve, I could solve most problems
[5148.35s -> 5149.65s]  with the crowbar, I think.
[5149.65s -> 5151.15s]  Getting in somewhere, helping,
[5151.15s -> 5154.45s]  just give me the crowbar and I could fix everything.
[5156.48s -> 5157.58s]  I could get leverage.
[5157.58s -> 5159.18s]  I could, you know, use it to hook on
[5159.18s -> 5161.08s]  and like climb a fucking wall and shit,
[5161.08s -> 5162.68s]  or like a rock.
[5162.68s -> 5165.78s]  I could do so much with the crowbar.
[5165.78s -> 5172.62s]  Am I spinning this again?
[5172.62s -> 5174.48s]  Bottom left?
[5174.48s -> 5175.68s]  You are two steps away.
[5175.68s -> 5178.14s]  What?
[5178.14s -> 5180.70s]  Spin left?
[5180.70s -> 5183.50s]  Holy shit.
[5183.50s -> 5184.80s]  How did you guys do that?
[5184.80s -> 5188.50s]  How did you do that collectively in two turns?
[5188.50s -> 5189.50s]  What?
[5189.50s -> 5192.50s]  I am, no, I am actually fucking losing my mind.
[5192.50s -> 5194.80s]  How, that's no, I did all that work.
[5194.80s -> 5195.70s]  I did all that work.
[5195.70s -> 5196.50s]  I did all that work.
[5196.50s -> 5197.90s]  That's bullshit and you know it.
[5197.90s -> 5200.00s]  I did all that work in two fucking moves.
[5200.00s -> 5201.40s]  You finish it.
[5201.40s -> 5202.20s]  I did all that work.
[5202.20s -> 5205.32s]  That was barely any of your work.
[5205.32s -> 5206.32s]  This is no way.
[5206.32s -> 5208.55s]  This is no way to move.
[5208.55s -> 5210.15s]  Yeah, I was, I loosened the lid.
[5210.15s -> 5211.75s]  I had the pickle jar and I was like,
[5214.82s -> 5217.02s]  and then you took it and after like 25 minutes
[5217.02s -> 5219.62s]  of me doing that, you went, I don't understand.
[5219.62s -> 5220.72s]  It's easy.
[5220.72s -> 5222.02s]  No, I did all the work.
[5222.02s -> 5225.78s]  I did all the work.
[5225.78s -> 5227.98s]  Yeah, I ran the lid under hot water.
[5227.98s -> 5230.18s]  I got a paper towel.
[5230.18s -> 5233.45s]  Oh, I did all that.
[5233.45s -> 5239.55s]  Okay, anyways, how high is your IQ?
[5239.55s -> 5242.75s]  I have an incredibly low performance IQ.
[5242.75s -> 5245.35s]  I have a very high IQ,
[5245.35s -> 5248.25s]  but my performance IQ was like,
[5248.25s -> 5254.90s]  actually like very bad.
[5254.90s -> 5257.20s]  It was abysmal.
[5257.20s -> 5259.10s]  Almost, I think there was actually a question
[5259.10s -> 5261.60s]  like almost as if I didn't take the test correctly
[5261.60s -> 5264.10s]  because my performance IQ was so low,
[5264.10s -> 5266.70s]  but my like my visual IQ and my audio,
[5266.70s -> 5268.00s]  like there's other IQs.
[5268.00s -> 5269.40s]  They were fucking through the roof.
[5269.40s -> 5272.39s]  They were absolutely through the roof.
[5272.39s -> 5273.89s]  So there you go.
[5273.89s -> 5274.79s]  There you go.
[5274.79s -> 5278.18s]  Live, you get to watch it.
[5278.18s -> 5282.24s]  Wait, was something in here?
[5282.24s -> 5284.05s]  I already was in here.
[5284.05s -> 5287.25s]  All right, so I did the hexagon puzzle.
[5287.25s -> 5297.76s]  Now, can I get through there from here?
[5297.76s -> 5301.97s]  It's funny because you are theoretically smart.
[5301.97s -> 5304.42s]  Exactly.
[5304.52s -> 5308.22s]  In theory, I'm very, very intelligent, very intelligent,
[5308.22s -> 5312.78s]  but in practice, not so much.
[5312.78s -> 5315.28s]  I should have been a philosopher.
[5315.28s -> 5316.12s]  You know what I mean?
[5316.12s -> 5318.48s]  Just like just talk and just like come up with theories
[5318.48s -> 5320.18s]  and maybe some solutions.
[5320.18s -> 5321.58s]  Other people will do all that though.
[5321.58s -> 5323.98s]  I'm just gonna drink wine and talk.
[5323.98s -> 5326.28s]  That's what I should have done.
[5326.28s -> 5334.92s]  I do that anyways.
[5334.92s -> 5340.69s]  All right, fish farm.
[5340.69s -> 5341.79s]  I hope that was entertaining
[5341.79s -> 5347.22s]  because it was very embarrassing and very painful.
[5347.22s -> 5348.82s]  I'm all right, I can't wait to see
[5349.02s -> 5351.69s]  all the clips.
[5351.69s -> 5354.09s]  Jerma's performance IQ is zero.
[5354.09s -> 5355.19s]  And it's gonna be that whole routine
[5355.19s -> 5356.29s]  and all the comments are gonna be like,
[5356.29s -> 5359.09s]  I actually can't even, how is that even possible?
[5359.09s -> 5360.49s]  How does he drive a car?
[5360.49s -> 5362.09s]  It's like not even, how does this guy operate?
[5362.09s -> 5363.79s]  And I'm gonna be like, no,
[5363.79s -> 5368.95s]  performance IQ level is pretty low.
[5368.95s -> 5382.66s]  All right, where is this something in here?
[5382.66s -> 5385.15s]  Is it in the meat grinder?
[5385.15s -> 5392.00s]  No, right there, okay.
[5392.00s -> 5399.02s]  And this is what I really wanted to do, right?
[5399.02s -> 5412.36s]  Is that, oh, whatever that thing is.
[5420.12s -> 5425.36s]  I go back up, shoot the red barrel.
[5425.36s -> 5431.58s]  No, no, I gotta come down a little bit and refocus.
[5431.58s -> 5434.38s]  I cannot believe that you guys did that in two turns.
[5434.38s -> 5435.48s]  Two spins did it.
[5436.48s -> 5439.48s]  It probably takes like 20 spins to do that puzzle.
[5439.48s -> 5441.84s]  I did all the work.
[5441.84s -> 5456.62s]  I will die on that hill.
[5456.62s -> 5458.42s]  Worth it, okay.
[5458.42s -> 5462.89s]  So I need to go to the church.
[5462.89s -> 5466.18s]  So I need to get out of here and go this way.
[5466.18s -> 5467.98s]  I'm just gonna go up and through here
[5467.98s -> 5470.58s]  and then back to the merchant.
[5470.58s -> 5476.10s]  Can I actually, now he's gonna walk around.
[5476.10s -> 5479.40s]  That wasn't even the thing I shot at.
[5479.40s -> 5481.38s]  Really?
[5481.38s -> 5511.02s]  Where's this other treasure then?
[5511.02s -> 5533.60s]  Where is it?
[5533.60s -> 5538.13s]  Antique pipe, whoa.
[5538.13s -> 5540.04s]  What is your chess elo?
[5540.04s -> 5541.97s]  I'll tell you.
[5541.97s -> 5545.17s]  My chess elo is whatever is not playing the game.
[5545.17s -> 5546.77s]  It's taking all the pieces out
[5546.77s -> 5550.77s]  and having a pretend war where you make them have characters
[5550.77s -> 5552.97s]  and you take like the bishop and the knight and stuff
[5552.97s -> 5554.17s]  and you make them like fight and stuff.
[5554.17s -> 5555.97s]  And that's how I played chess.
[5556.07s -> 5558.67s]  You make a fake, like they're action figures.
[5562.43s -> 5565.03s]  Or it's as a set piece so people think you're intelligent.
[5565.03s -> 5569.03s]  It's just in your living room and it's a chess board
[5569.03s -> 5570.63s]  and there's a game currently on it
[5570.63s -> 5572.23s]  and you just put the pieces in random places
[5572.23s -> 5574.43s]  and people go, wow, intense game going on here.
[5574.43s -> 5576.03s]  You don't play it at all.
[5576.03s -> 5578.23s]  You've never played it before.
[5578.23s -> 5580.63s]  It's just people going, oh, there's an intense game
[5580.63s -> 5582.23s]  of chess going on over there at some point.
[5582.23s -> 5584.33s]  I wonder, high intelligence in this house.
[5589.51s -> 5591.51s]  All right, I'm focusing now.
[5591.51s -> 5592.41s]  It's been an hour.
[5598.14s -> 5604.58s]  I'm having a lot of fun though.
[5604.58s -> 5607.98s]  Where's the way to get out of here?
[5607.98s -> 5610.22s]  Over here.
[5610.22s -> 5622.12s]  Can I go to the right?
[5622.12s -> 5625.64s]  How come you look so pissed off?
[5625.64s -> 5649.86s]  I already answered this.
[5649.86s -> 5655.36s]  All right, we have made it.
[5655.36s -> 5656.96s]  We're so close.
[5656.96s -> 5665.15s]  Exactly as intended.
[5669.68s -> 5673.46s]  7,000, 15,000.
[5677.06s -> 5678.56s]  That's all I can do with this, right?
[5678.56s -> 5686.19s]  Selling only, yeah.
[5686.19s -> 5688.39s]  I'm just gonna max out the handgun.
[5692.32s -> 5695.62s]  Craftsmanship demands no less.
[5695.62s -> 5697.72s]  See how that feels, mate.
[5697.72s -> 5698.82s]  A fellow like yourself
[5698.82s -> 5701.22s]  should notice the difference right away.
[5701.22s -> 5703.02s]  Well, that might want to take care
[5703.02s -> 5704.82s]  of any leftover errands.
[5707.36s -> 5709.66s]  Let's go.
[5712.96s -> 5717.46s]  All right, back to the church.
[5717.46s -> 5721.30s]  Wait, no, it's not time to do that.
[5721.30s -> 5735.64s]  I can play the casino gambling game.
[5735.64s -> 5738.70s]  Oh, I only have two.
[5738.70s -> 5753.86s]  Shit, nevermind, I thought I had three.
[5753.86s -> 5764.32s]  Okay, time to go to the church.
[5764.32s -> 5765.22s]  There is.
[5765.22s -> 5778.94s]  Oh, very nice.
[5778.94s -> 5788.09s]  I could do three reds in this.
[5788.09s -> 5794.24s]  21, I'll hold them in there for now.
[5794.24s -> 5795.98s]  Probably not permanently.
[5795.98s -> 5799.18s]  Lights off, it's still not quite that dark.
[5799.18s -> 5820.01s]  Lights will go off in about 15 minutes, 20 minutes still.
[5820.01s -> 5830.08s]  Plus blood.
[5830.08s -> 5831.68s]  I'm wearing the gamer vest
[5831.68s -> 5834.58s]  that vibrates in shock when things happen.
[5843.69s -> 5851.80s]  Defeat the giant.
[5851.80s -> 5864.84s]  Oh shit.
[5864.84s -> 5865.94s]  Oh.
[5890.17s -> 5896.62s]  Where is it?
[5896.62s -> 5897.46s]  Stab.
[5923.52s -> 5924.36s]  Dog.
[5932.21s -> 5937.50s]  Dog friend.
[5937.50s -> 5950.74s]  Ow.
[5950.74s -> 5952.78s]  With the dog from the beginning
[5952.78s -> 5956.45s]  that I let out of the trap.
[5956.45s -> 5957.55s]  What?
[5957.55s -> 5959.35s]  The knife broke.
[5959.35s -> 5961.75s]  Oh, that's not good.
[5961.75s -> 5968.05s]  It breaks in mid fight like that?
[5968.05s -> 5979.20s]  The dog.
[5979.20s -> 5980.04s]  Oh, no.
[5991.83s -> 5993.33s]  What the fuck am I doing?
[6022.96s -> 6024.36s]  The knife can break up here.
[6046.65s -> 6051.09s]  The dog is so bloody on one side.
[6051.09s -> 6052.39s]  It's like two-faced.
[6052.39s -> 6054.99s]  The dog, half the dog's body is like fucked up.
[6065.23s -> 6066.33s]  Where's the dog?
[6066.33s -> 6071.24s]  Okay, let's get to that church.
[6071.24s -> 6082.21s]  Where's the dog?
[6082.21s -> 6084.21s]  Can't you say, where's the dog?
[6084.21s -> 6085.31s]  Can't you see the dog?
[6095.08s -> 6097.38s]  Oh, there you are.
[6097.38s -> 6098.88s]  Hey, thank you so much.
[6098.88s -> 6099.72s]  Thanks bud.
[6099.72s -> 6102.65s]  You're awesome, appreciate it.
[6102.65s -> 6105.32s]  You are very, very cool.
[6105.32s -> 6108.00s]  And good luck.
[6108.00s -> 6112.07s]  I would throw you a raw turkey if I had one, but I don't.
[6112.07s -> 6118.21s]  Take care of yourself, it's fucking wacky out here.
[6118.21s -> 6120.76s]  I think I got everything, right?
[6120.76s -> 6122.56s]  I thought I threw a grenade at the dog, by the way.
[6122.56s -> 6124.61s]  That's why I was...
[6124.61s -> 6127.91s]  That's where you got the YouTube thumbnail from.
[6127.91s -> 6135.55s]  I thought I threw a grenade and blew the dog up.
[6135.55s -> 6136.75s]  There is something else here.
[6136.75s -> 6137.55s]  There it is.
[6154.55s -> 6162.23s]  Nothing else I can do with the dog, I don't think.
[6162.23s -> 6164.11s]  Very cool.
[6164.11s -> 6170.79s]  All right, back to the church.
[6170.79s -> 6174.39s]  Nobody got me, I know Resident Evil dog got me.
[6194.73s -> 6199.33s]  I hear a treasure.
[6199.33s -> 6211.79s]  Oh, that's gonna fall all the way into the water.
[6211.79s -> 6212.89s]  Can anybody tell what it is?
[6212.89s -> 6214.29s]  I think it's just money.
[6214.29s -> 6229.75s]  Should I go get it?
[6229.75s -> 6232.59s]  Okay, next section.
[6232.59s -> 6234.19s]  I think this is a different act
[6234.19s -> 6239.05s]  or a different chapter, I think.
[6239.05s -> 6242.98s]  By the way, is the brightness okay?
[6242.98s -> 6267.93s]  Remember that was a problem a little bit yesterday.
[6267.93s -> 6268.83s]  Good enough, it's okay.
[6268.83s -> 6279.48s]  Make it a little brighter.
[6279.48s -> 6282.90s]  I don't wanna go too bright.
[6282.90s -> 6286.97s]  That looks better.
[6286.97s -> 6293.30s]  All right, I'm gonna save it.
[6293.30s -> 6297.40s]  Capturing a game through OBS sometimes.
[6297.40s -> 6300.66s]  I feel like it makes it darker.
[6300.66s -> 6337.98s]  Darker than it looks for me.
[6337.98s -> 6358.47s]  I feel like I have enough room to put this in here now.
[6358.47s -> 6363.21s]  Hello, didn't I learn how to craft mines?
[6363.21s -> 6371.48s]  Oh, that's a lot.
[6371.48s -> 6378.50s]  That is a lot of materials.
[6378.50s -> 6380.55s]  Are they attached?
[6380.55s -> 6381.85s]  Oh, gee, okay.
[6381.85s -> 6385.82s]  Well, I'm not gonna use this for like another, okay.
[6385.82s -> 6392.20s]  Maybe for bosses, that's pretty cool.
[6392.20s -> 6412.30s]  I think there is a, save it.
[6412.30s -> 6415.20s]  If I remember correctly, this is the scary,
[6415.20s -> 6416.90s]  really scary part of the game.
[6416.90s -> 6418.30s]  I always hated this place.
[6418.30s -> 6422.12s]  Ashley Graham, I'm here to help.
[6422.12s -> 6424.02s]  No, I think that's a little bit later.
[6424.02s -> 6425.22s]  I'm trying to think of a specific enemy type
[6425.22s -> 6482.09s]  that was terrifying and I hate fighting.
[6482.09s -> 6490.94s]  Okay, I need to move the, I need to move blue too.
[6490.94s -> 6492.64s]  Can't do this without moving blue.
[6492.64s -> 6497.08s]  So I might as well just not even do it.
[6497.08s -> 6501.52s]  Yeah, I gotta move the blue one.
[6501.52s -> 6506.35s]  The blue one is literally up there, isn't it?
[6506.35s -> 6511.24s]  I gotta move the blue one.
[6511.24s -> 6512.64s]  I don't wanna hold on to these honestly
[6512.64s -> 6522.50s]  because I'm not gonna use the gun.
[6522.50s -> 6529.63s]  There's the blue dial.
[6529.73s -> 6531.97s]  All right, now we can do this, but wait.
[6531.97s -> 6537.88s]  Bolts, five bolts, that's a lot.
[6537.88s -> 6540.08s]  Anything else?
[6540.08s -> 6595.35s]  All right, let's do it.
[6595.35s -> 6650.38s]  Blue is correct.
[6650.38s -> 6651.48s]  So fucking close.
[6651.48s -> 6661.42s]  What's going on here?
[6661.42s -> 6674.09s]  I just fucked the whole thing up.
[6674.09s -> 6677.67s]  The logo, what?
[6677.67s -> 6682.38s]  Please, Jerma, you aren't taking long enough, what?
[6682.38s -> 6684.68s]  It needs to go like in the, okay, hold on.
[6684.68s -> 6686.08s]  Everything has to be shifted to the left.
[6686.08s -> 6688.49s]  Oh no, wait, it's upside down.
[6688.49s -> 6704.40s]  Okay, so everything has to go this way, like here.
[6704.40s -> 6706.30s]  I hate using ADQE.
[6706.30s -> 6713.18s]  I just wish I could use a fucking analog stick.
[6713.18s -> 6714.84s]  Oh, I hate this.
[6714.84s -> 6726.53s]  ADQE is making me wanna fucking puke.
[6726.53s -> 6732.69s]  There it is.
[6732.69s -> 6741.35s]  I had it upside down.
[6741.35s -> 6742.65s]  Hey, yo, he did it.
[6742.65s -> 6747.18s]  I did.
[6747.18s -> 6752.23s]  I'll be taking autographs after this for you.
[6752.23s -> 6766.12s]  Ashley, you in there?
[6766.12s -> 6769.34s]  What was that?
[6769.34s -> 6771.14s]  That just felt like doing that.
[6771.14s -> 6796.32s]  If there's a problem, then you can leave.
[6796.32s -> 6800.16s]  Ashley, Ashley Graham, are you in here?
[6804.07s -> 6806.75s]  Listen.
[6806.75s -> 6808.72s]  Ow.
[6808.72s -> 6810.34s]  That hurt.
[6810.34s -> 6812.48s]  My name's Leon.
[6812.48s -> 6814.28s]  I'm here in the president's quarters.
[6820.81s -> 6826.42s]  I think, I think there should be some kind of code word
[6826.42s -> 6828.62s]  to be like, hey, you know that I'm here
[6828.62s -> 6829.72s]  and I'm like a good guy.
[6829.72s -> 6830.52s]  What is that?
[6830.52s -> 6841.36s]  Assue them.
[6841.36s -> 6843.84s]  Boss lambs are a skin.
[6843.84s -> 6846.84s]  Yes, persevere.
[6846.84s -> 6852.46s]  Deliver unto them.
[6852.46s -> 6862.29s]  Salvation.
[6862.29s -> 6872.96s]  We both just had the same dream.
[6872.96s -> 6874.86s]  This is real, this is getting real.
[6874.86s -> 6883.09s]  It's getting better.
[6883.09s -> 6885.29s]  This take like 30 or 40 minutes off.
[6885.29s -> 6910.67s]  We were having a bunch of conversations.
[6910.67s -> 6911.87s]  We were having a conversation.
[6911.87s -> 6914.18s]  What do we do?
[6914.18s -> 6918.62s]  Your father trusts me.
[6918.62s -> 6920.22s]  And I need you to trust me too.
[6920.22s -> 6921.52s]  And do exactly as I say.
[6921.52s -> 6924.52s]  I can also announce that I will be putting on the
[6924.52s -> 6940.29s]  comedy costume for 15 minutes.
[6940.29s -> 6947.38s]  And the lights I'll go off too.
[6947.38s -> 6949.62s]  Let's get the hell out of here.
[6949.62s -> 6950.82s]  Okay.
[6955.30s -> 6956.40s]  Seriously?
[6956.40s -> 6957.90s]  I just bought this.
[6957.90s -> 6958.90s]  Oh, cell phone.
[6958.90s -> 6985.98s]  Okay.
[6985.98s -> 6989.14s]  There's a way out, there's a way out.
[6989.14s -> 6991.33s]  I'm going to jump out the window.
[6991.33s -> 6995.83s]  This shining the light in your face.
[6995.83s -> 7013.16s]  Accessory glasses.
[7013.16s -> 7017.29s]  Wellington.
[7017.29s -> 7018.19s]  What do you mean glasses?
[7018.19s -> 7019.59s]  What do you mean Wellington?
[7019.59s -> 7020.93s]  What do you mean?
[7020.93s -> 7022.93s]  What are you talking about my Wellington?
[7022.93s -> 7023.73s]  What are you doing?
[7023.73s -> 7024.83s]  Stop it.
[7024.83s -> 7025.63s]  What are you doing in my Wellington?
[7025.63s -> 7026.23s]  Stop.
[7026.23s -> 7027.33s]  Stop it.
[7027.33s -> 7041.02s]  It's okay.
[7041.02s -> 7045.92s]  I've got you.
[7045.92s -> 7052.20s]  It's like he gets possessed.
[7052.20s -> 7064.06s]  Hey, trust me.
[7064.06s -> 7067.06s]  I think it's kind of funny if she landed in his hands
[7067.06s -> 7070.16s]  and it's raining or she slipped and she fell right down.
[7070.16s -> 7079.94s]  Just like.
[7079.94s -> 7084.86s]  Pressures.
[7084.86s -> 7086.26s]  Don't do that.
[7086.26s -> 7087.56s]  Do not just do what I just did.
[7087.56s -> 7089.26s]  That was a bad idea.
[7089.26s -> 7090.30s]  Copy that.
[7090.30s -> 7091.74s]  Is she okay?
[7091.74s -> 7092.24s]  Affirmative.
[7092.24s -> 7095.64s]  For ASAP.
[7095.64s -> 7099.35s]  I'm sending you the call for the extraction point.
[7099.35s -> 7102.66s]  May happen to baby eagle.
[7102.66s -> 7103.66s]  Copy that.
[7103.66s -> 7104.46s]  Hurry.
[7104.46s -> 7106.36s]  The weather is getting worse.
[7106.36s -> 7110.58s]  Roost out.
[7110.58s -> 7110.98s]  All right.
[7110.98s -> 7112.98s]  Head to the extraction points all the way up here.
[7112.98s -> 7116.78s]  We got to go through the all the way back to where we were.
[7116.78s -> 7117.78s]  Town hall.
[7117.78s -> 7122.59s]  Like I said, it's dangerous.
[7122.59s -> 7123.19s]  Stay close.
[7123.19s -> 7126.08s]  I'm going to eat an egg.
[7126.08s -> 7127.48s]  Want one?
[7127.48s -> 7131.45s]  I mean, they're raw.
[7131.45s -> 7133.05s]  You just crunch them.
[7133.05s -> 7134.45s]  But food.
[7134.45s -> 7149.06s]  Come on.
[7149.06s -> 7151.36s]  Okay, Ashley commands.
[7151.36s -> 7153.86s]  Switch between tight and loose formation with control.
[7153.86s -> 7156.86s]  Ashley will stick close behind Leon while in tight formation.
[7156.86s -> 7161.75s]  This can be effective when running past enemies.
[7161.75s -> 7163.05s]  Okay.
[7163.05s -> 7165.55s]  So you hang back.
[7165.55s -> 7167.05s]  Avoid attacks.
[7167.05s -> 7168.45s]  Give me some space.
[7168.55s -> 7171.94s]  Okay.
[7171.94s -> 7173.48s]  On me.
[7173.48s -> 7173.78s]  Got it.
[7173.78s -> 7175.15s]  Spread out.
[7175.15s -> 7175.75s]  Hey.
[7175.75s -> 7177.42s]  With me.
[7177.42s -> 7178.90s]  Spread out.
[7178.90s -> 7193.63s]  Hey.
[7193.63s -> 7195.13s]  Stick close.
[7195.13s -> 7196.33s]  Okay.
[7201.07s -> 7201.47s]  They're coming.
[7201.47s -> 7206.66s]  Get behind me.
[7206.66s -> 7226.91s]  Watch out.
[7226.91s -> 7227.71s]  What?
[7227.71s -> 7228.91s]  What's going on?
[7228.91s -> 7232.19s]  Oh shit.
[7232.19s -> 7232.69s]  Okay.
[7232.69s -> 7233.09s]  All right.
[7233.09s -> 7233.69s]  All right.
[7233.69s -> 7244.24s]  Stay behind me.
[7244.24s -> 7244.84s]  Oh my God.
[7244.84s -> 7272.39s]  I just shot Ashley in the fucking head.
[7272.39s -> 7276.30s]  Here you go.
[7276.30s -> 7276.80s]  Oh, you're fine.
[7276.80s -> 7311.46s]  We're good.
[7311.46s -> 7313.16s]  Ashley, are you all right?
[7313.16s -> 7313.86s]  Yeah.
[7313.86s -> 7317.94s]  Thanks.
[7317.94s -> 7318.14s]  All right.
[7318.14s -> 7331.99s]  Let's move.
[7331.99s -> 7340.43s]  Another grenade.
[7340.43s -> 7348.48s]  Don't walk in that.
[7348.48s -> 7349.98s]  I hear...
[7349.98s -> 7372.33s]  Why do I hear a dynamite stick?
[7372.33s -> 7373.73s]  Remember, you're going to kill this girl.
[7373.73s -> 7390.99s]  I am not going to kill this girl.
[7390.99s -> 7391.79s]  Spread out.
[7391.79s -> 7393.01s]  Okay.
[7393.01s -> 7399.94s]  Come on.
[7399.94s -> 7401.34s]  You already attempted to.
[7401.34s -> 7401.64s]  What?
[7401.64s -> 7404.10s]  No, I didn't.
[7404.10s -> 7414.60s]  I threw a grenade.
[7414.60s -> 7414.80s]  All right.
[7414.80s -> 7419.40s]  We made it.
[7419.40s -> 7420.80s]  So far so good.
[7420.80s -> 7422.70s]  Got some new wares, stranger.
[7422.70s -> 7426.08s]  You're in for a treat.
[7426.08s -> 7426.28s]  All right.
[7426.28s -> 7428.28s]  I got some stuff.
[7428.28s -> 7430.28s]  I got something new for you.
[7430.28s -> 7439.38s]  Those won't do you much good in the grave.
[7439.38s -> 7440.08s]  Let me check this.
[7440.08s -> 7443.09s]  Hold on.
[7443.09s -> 7455.23s]  Two red, one yellow.
[7455.23s -> 7457.42s]  Three red is better.
[7457.42s -> 7459.22s]  All red is better.
[7459.22s -> 7464.84s]  I'll just do all red then.
[7464.84s -> 7468.80s]  I'll do all red.
[7468.80s -> 7469.70s]  Welcome.
[7469.70s -> 7475.86s]  Au revoir.
[7475.86s -> 7483.48s]  Thank you.
[7483.48s -> 7484.68s]  This is good.
[7484.68s -> 7484.88s]  All right.
[7484.88s -> 7487.98s]  I got to get this much better.
[7487.98s -> 7488.98s]  Power for the shotgun.
[7488.98s -> 7490.78s]  It's a thing of beauty.
[7490.78s -> 7492.48s]  And I will not forget the comedy outfit.
[7492.48s -> 7495.84s]  I promise.
[7495.84s -> 7500.41s]  I think I'm just going full power with it.
[7500.41s -> 7503.81s]  And then I reload speed.
[7503.81s -> 7506.48s]  Rate of fire.
[7506.48s -> 7507.92s]  Yeah.
[7507.92s -> 7509.22s]  There you are.
[7509.22s -> 7510.92s]  As you wished.
[7510.92s -> 7511.82s]  Where would it?
[7511.82s -> 7513.42s]  What can I do you for?
[7513.42s -> 7516.39s]  Come back any time.
[7516.39s -> 7517.09s]  Is there a...
[7517.09s -> 7518.19s]  Yes, there is.
[7518.19s -> 7518.49s]  All right.
[7518.49s -> 7523.53s]  We're going to go comedy outfit.
[7523.53s -> 7532.23s]  How do I do it?
[7532.23s -> 7535.76s]  Is it not from the settings menu?
[7535.76s -> 7536.36s]  Oh, extras.
[7536.36s -> 7539.97s]  Okay, here we go.
[7539.97s -> 7546.94s]  Can only be changed from the main menu.
[7546.94s -> 7550.88s]  Well, I'll go to the main menu.
[7550.88s -> 7575.95s]  I just saved it, right?
[7575.95s -> 7576.95s]  Where is it?
[7576.95s -> 7596.09s]  I'm safe.
[7596.09s -> 7597.79s]  Try using nice next time.
[7597.79s -> 7599.79s]  Try using nice next time.
[7599.79s -> 7605.43s]  Hey, we're a team, right?
[7605.43s -> 7609.26s]  Hey, we're a team, right?
[7609.26s -> 7613.32s]  How do I put these on?
[7613.32s -> 7619.15s]  Oh, okay.
[7619.15s -> 7619.65s]  All right.
[7619.65s -> 7621.97s]  I'm going to put this one on.
[7621.97s -> 7624.88s]  He's keeping the sunglasses on.
[7624.88s -> 7628.57s]  Casual or romantic?
[7628.57s -> 7639.12s]  I think it's this one.
[7639.22s -> 7642.96s]  I'm only doing this for...
[7642.96s -> 7649.78s]  I'm only doing this for like 20 minutes.
[7649.78s -> 7651.18s]  Speaking of a few minutes,
[7651.18s -> 7651.88s]  I'm going to...
[7651.88s -> 7654.55s]  I'm going to go refill this.
[7654.55s -> 7664.00s]  But, goodness.
[7664.00s -> 7665.90s]  This feels like a different game.
[7665.90s -> 7674.29s]  This doesn't even feel like the same game anymore.
[7674.29s -> 7674.59s]  Give me a moment.
[7674.59s -> 7675.69s]  I'll be right back.
[7675.69s -> 7950.28s]  I'm just going to go pee and refill my drink.
[7950.28s -> 7955.65s]  I am back.
[7955.65s -> 7958.90s]  Okay.
[7958.90s -> 7963.36s]  Oh, I refilled my drink.
[7963.36s -> 7964.36s]  Nice.
[7964.36s -> 7974.46s]  Hydrating tea.
[7974.46s -> 7974.96s]  Okay.
[7974.96s -> 7979.62s]  I think we are good to go.
[7979.62s -> 7981.38s]  At least we should be.
[7981.38s -> 7982.08s]  How's the camera?
[7982.08s -> 7983.78s]  Should the camera be like lowered or moved or something?
[7983.78s -> 7984.48s]  I feel like it's...
[7984.48s -> 7995.46s]  I always feel like my camera is either way too big or way too small.
[7995.46s -> 8013.01s]  Is it good?
[8013.01s -> 8013.81s]  I think it's all right.
[8013.81s -> 8019.75s]  Is it maybe a little too big?
[8019.75s -> 8022.30s]  Oh, light's off.
[8022.30s -> 8032.85s]  That's right.
[8032.85s -> 8034.31s]  It is dark.
[8034.31s -> 8037.77s]  Let's see how that looks.
[8037.77s -> 8040.46s]  Okay, we're good.
[8040.46s -> 8053.88s]  I think this is a good illumination level.
[8053.88s -> 8056.00s]  Good.
[8056.00s -> 8059.00s]  What's the quest?
[8059.00s -> 8062.10s]  I need someone to get rid of the wild dog that's been roaming around the village.
[8062.10s -> 8063.10s]  It'll be easy to spot.
[8063.10s -> 8067.33s]  It's not like normal dogs.
[8067.33s -> 8068.13s]  Eight.
[8068.13s -> 8071.32s]  Spinals.
[8071.42s -> 8073.86s]  Village Manor.
[8073.86s -> 8081.94s]  Over here.
[8081.94s -> 8082.14s]  Okay.
[8082.14s -> 8092.12s]  Well, I forgot that I did that.
[8092.12s -> 8095.76s]  Makes over, I suppose.
[8095.76s -> 8102.18s]  Let's go.
[8102.18s -> 8104.08s]  Hey, can we take a break?
[8104.08s -> 8117.85s]  Sorry, we need to keep moving.
[8117.85s -> 8135.79s]  I don't want to go too fast because I'll run into something.
[8135.79s -> 8142.58s]  Hunnigan was right about the weather.
[8142.58s -> 8164.68s]  I'm over here in dark.
[8164.68s -> 8167.22s]  What am I doing?
[8167.22s -> 8175.36s]  I'm like, why am I crumpling up into like a little ball?
[8175.36s -> 8193.02s]  Good.
[8193.02s -> 8218.83s]  Uh-oh.
[8218.83s -> 8222.43s]  I put these new costumes on and my FPS went down by like
[8222.43s -> 8223.73s]  40%.
[8223.73s -> 8244.80s]  I'm just saying maybe still the fire.
[8244.80s -> 8252.61s]  Oh my.
[8252.61s -> 8252.81s]  All right.
[8252.81s -> 8259.45s]  There's a big dog somewhere.
[8259.45s -> 8260.55s]  Can I get in here now?
[8260.55s -> 8275.98s]  It's still blocked up.
[8275.98s -> 8278.83s]  Oh wait, we can get in here.
[8278.83s -> 8279.43s]  Okay.
[8279.43s -> 8295.45s]  I need you to open it from the other side.
[8295.45s -> 8300.17s]  It's up.
[8300.17s -> 8305.55s]  Good work.
[8305.55s -> 8307.85s]  Elegant bangle.
[8307.85s -> 8316.71s]  Cool.
[8316.71s -> 8317.51s]  Anything else in here?
[8317.51s -> 8322.51s]  I think there's a yep.
[8322.51s -> 8322.71s]  All right.
[8322.71s -> 8343.95s]  I can use the gumball machine.
[8343.95s -> 8361.33s]  Where's this dog?
[8361.33s -> 8372.85s]  People upstairs.
[8372.95s -> 8382.15s]  It on there.
[8382.15s -> 8391.16s]  Let's go.
[8391.16s -> 8400.85s]  Maybe this shit in here.
[8400.85s -> 8405.36s]  Where's the chief right?
[8405.36s -> 8410.62s]  River said said in the elder.
[8410.62s -> 8416.98s]  What was it a chief's house down here?
[8416.98s -> 8430.98s]  Maybe she good.
[8430.98s -> 8432.86s]  Okay.
[8432.86s -> 8435.64s]  It's actually it's on the map.
[8435.64s -> 8437.34s]  Ah, it is.
[8437.34s -> 8437.64s]  Okay.
[8437.64s -> 8438.04s]  I'm going.
[8438.04s -> 8440.38s]  I'm going to do it.
[8440.38s -> 8440.58s]  Yeah.
[8440.58s -> 8441.38s]  Look at all this stuff.
[8441.38s -> 8442.08s]  I'm going to go.
[8442.08s -> 8453.79s]  Oh, this is far away though.
[8453.79s -> 8459.17s]  Not that far.
[8459.17s -> 8459.97s]  All right, we're going.
[8459.97s -> 8463.17s]  I'm doing it.
[8463.17s -> 8466.27s]  I have Ashley though.
[8466.27s -> 8486.82s]  I feel like that's going to be dangerous.
[8486.82s -> 8488.52s]  Oh, there it is.
[8488.52s -> 8489.32s]  Oh, it's a bat.
[8489.32s -> 8511.38s]  I thought it was one of those hanging things.
[8511.38s -> 8512.28s]  All right.
[8512.28s -> 8513.68s]  You stay here.
[8513.68s -> 8514.88s]  It's all right.
[8514.88s -> 8515.88s]  Stay there.
[8515.88s -> 8518.58s]  Don't move.
[8518.58s -> 8518.88s]  All right.
[8518.88s -> 8524.59s]  There's apparently a giant dog here.
[8524.59s -> 8526.26s]  I'm ready.
[8526.26s -> 8527.06s]  Stay back there.
[8527.06s -> 8545.91s]  Don't come near me.
[8545.91s -> 8546.51s]  Oh my God.
[8546.51s -> 8563.96s]  Don't do that.
[8563.96s -> 8565.62s]  One egg.
[8565.72s -> 8577.66s]  Who's baking one single egg in the shell?
[8577.66s -> 8593.52s]  I thought I heard a little jingle.
[8593.52s -> 8620.95s]  Oh, where is this dog?
[8620.95s -> 8629.40s]  He's going to be in here.
[8629.40s -> 8648.68s]  He's going to be lying in the bed or something.
[8648.68s -> 8650.19s]  Come on.
[8650.19s -> 8650.89s]  No problem.
[8650.89s -> 8659.18s]  Oh shit.
[8659.18s -> 8662.77s]  Above the bed.
[8662.77s -> 8663.37s]  Why?
[8663.37s -> 8676.72s]  Stop.
[8676.72s -> 8677.32s]  Oh shit.
[8677.32s -> 8684.46s]  Nice.
[8684.46s -> 8708.57s]  Take a screenshot of each one of those and just read it.
[8708.57s -> 8713.47s]  Iron works.
[8713.47s -> 8730.99s]  Very nice.
[8730.99s -> 8739.35s]  Antique camera.
[8739.35s -> 8748.56s]  That sell for a lot.
[8748.56s -> 8749.86s]  This is also one of those.
[8749.86s -> 8750.36s]  I hear it.
[8750.36s -> 8754.00s]  Where is it?
[8754.00s -> 8762.52s]  There it is.
[8762.52s -> 8764.32s]  So where is this dog?
[8764.32s -> 8825.84s]  This apparently gigantic dog.
[8825.84s -> 8829.85s]  That looks like a dog.
[8829.85s -> 8831.05s]  Is this the?
[8831.05s -> 8831.75s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[8831.75s -> 8832.35s]  Get over here.
[8832.35s -> 8840.55s]  Get over here.
[8840.55s -> 8841.25s]  Where's this dog?
[8841.25s -> 8877.69s]  Where did it go?
[8877.69s -> 8895.95s]  Whoa.
[8895.95s -> 8903.69s]  He's still alive.
[8903.69s -> 8912.80s]  There you go.
[8912.80s -> 8914.20s]  Oh, that's good.
[8914.20s -> 8924.45s]  I can complete that other treasure now.
[8924.45s -> 8924.75s]  All right.
[8924.75s -> 8928.27s]  Let's keep moving.
[8928.27s -> 8937.12s]  I missed money in there.
[8937.12s -> 8941.86s]  Where's the money?
[8941.86s -> 8942.64s]  All right.
[8942.64s -> 8945.76s]  Cool.
[8945.76s -> 8947.16s]  That's eight spinals for that.
[8947.16s -> 8948.26s]  That's a lot.
[8948.26s -> 8948.46s]  All right.
[8948.46s -> 8949.76s]  We got to go the other way.
[8949.76s -> 8952.73s]  Now we got to go in.
[8952.73s -> 8953.73s]  There's a treasure in there.
[8953.73s -> 8955.23s]  But whatever.
[8955.23s -> 8959.40s]  I'm just going to go back up.
[8959.40s -> 8960.70s]  That was fun.
[8960.70s -> 8962.40s]  I like the little quest that they added.
[8962.40s -> 8968.09s]  Because that stuff was not in the other game.
[8968.09s -> 8971.82s]  A little side content.
[8971.82s -> 8984.32s]  Let's go.
[8984.32s -> 8987.25s]  That's the best way to go.
[8987.25s -> 8988.95s]  I'm going to go this way.
[8988.95s -> 8995.17s]  The blue targets were in the original,
[8995.17s -> 8996.87s]  but not the other stuff.
[8996.87s -> 8998.47s]  Yeah, that stuff is really cool.
[8998.47s -> 9012.46s]  I like it.
[9012.46s -> 9013.36s]  Mm-hmm.
[9013.36s -> 9013.96s]  Mm-hmm.
[9013.96s -> 9027.50s]  We're good.
[9027.50s -> 9030.28s]  All right.
[9030.28s -> 9032.68s]  Just stay with me.
[9032.68s -> 9049.36s]  Because this is new content incoming.
[9049.36s -> 9052.11s]  New content.
[9052.11s -> 9056.79s]  Did you see the nerfed sludge in Grotto Beasts?
[9056.79s -> 9057.29s]  Yeah.
[9057.29s -> 9076.02s]  I mean, it's really, really powerful.
[9076.02s -> 9094.52s]  Oh, my.
[9094.52s -> 9102.19s]  Trying to save ammo.
[9102.19s -> 9102.69s]  Oh, shit.
[9102.69s -> 9104.39s]  That guy has a mask on.
[9104.39s -> 9106.10s]  Come this way.
[9106.10s -> 9109.71s]  This way, this way, this way, this way, this way.
[9109.71s -> 9111.01s]  Oh, my God.
[9111.01s -> 9112.21s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[9112.21s -> 9113.91s]  Just up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[9113.91s -> 9116.81s]  Ashley, up here.
[9116.81s -> 9118.70s]  Oh, my God.
[9118.70s -> 9126.06s]  Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up.
[9126.06s -> 9129.39s]  Get out of the way, get out of the way, get out of the way, get.
[9129.39s -> 9135.45s]  Holy.
[9135.45s -> 9136.35s]  Oh, no.
[9136.35s -> 9136.85s]  Oh, no.
[9136.85s -> 9138.15s]  I'm in trouble.
[9143.57s -> 9156.06s]  I think I killed him.
[9156.06s -> 9162.03s]  Hurry up, hurry up.
[9162.03s -> 9166.95s]  Uh-oh.
[9166.95s -> 9179.67s]  Jesus.
[9179.67s -> 9201.62s]  Is he dead?
[9201.62s -> 9203.90s]  All right, we're good.
[9203.90s -> 9219.46s]  That was pretty nuts.
[9219.46s -> 9220.96s]  I need to craft some ammo.
[9220.96s -> 9224.54s]  This is getting kind of bad.
[9224.54s -> 9230.96s]  All right, I'm going to go check this out.
[9230.96s -> 9232.80s]  Where's the treasure?
[9232.80s -> 9234.78s]  Back here.
[9234.78s -> 9235.78s]  Oh, yep, yep, yep.
[9235.78s -> 9239.46s]  I remember this.
[9239.46s -> 9241.96s]  This might be it for this as well.
[9241.96s -> 9277.60s]  Oh, no.
[9277.60s -> 9292.58s]  I just told her to back up.
[9292.58s -> 9295.18s]  Oh, yeah, I got to close all those doors.
[9295.18s -> 9296.34s]  You.
[9296.34s -> 9297.34s]  Hey.
[9297.34s -> 9298.84s]  Listen, about earlier.
[9298.84s -> 9299.64s]  Yeah, about that.
[9299.64s -> 9300.64s]  You imagine?
[9300.64s -> 9304.84s]  I saw him like two hours ago in game.
[9304.84s -> 9308.88s]  And now I'm dressed like this.
[9308.88s -> 9310.68s]  What's the explanation here?
[9310.68s -> 9314.50s]  All have names.
[9314.50s -> 9315.10s]  Now then.
[9315.10s -> 9318.00s]  I dyed my hair since we talked two hours ago.
[9318.00s -> 9320.15s]  What are you doing here?
[9320.15s -> 9324.46s]  Very good questions, unfortunately.
[9324.46s -> 9326.90s]  Hide now.
[9326.90s -> 9330.13s]  In that case, here, help me.
[9330.13s -> 9331.33s]  Ashley, quick.
[9331.33s -> 9333.47s]  Over here.
[9333.47s -> 9344.50s]  He is wrong.
[9344.50s -> 9346.81s]  OK, it's game time.
[9346.81s -> 9349.01s]  Don't you feel like I saw his outfit
[9349.01s -> 9359.03s]  and was like, I got to one up you.
[9359.03s -> 9362.17s]  It's made up of monsters.
[9362.17s -> 9363.87s]  Oh, she's going to pick up everything.
[9363.87s -> 9377.44s]  I hope you can shut up, baby.
[9377.44s -> 9378.04s]  Upstairs.
[9378.04s -> 9415.30s]  Let's go, let's go, let's go.
[9415.30s -> 9416.10s]  Ow.
[9416.10s -> 9416.90s]  I tried to parry it.
[9416.90s -> 9493.82s]  It didn't work.
[9493.82s -> 9516.06s]  Whoa.
[9516.06s -> 9516.76s]  I'm sorry.
[9516.76s -> 9518.26s]  I'm fucking such a weirdo.
[9518.26s -> 9550.00s]  Uh-oh.
[9550.00s -> 9554.78s]  What the?
[9554.78s -> 9557.78s]  I blocked that with my hand.
[9557.78s -> 9559.48s]  What the fuck?
[9559.48s -> 9562.28s]  My arms would be skewered right now.
[9562.28s -> 9564.58s]  I blocked that with my fingers.
[9564.58s -> 9566.88s]  What the fuck?
[9566.88s -> 9575.76s]  Oh, shit.
[9575.76s -> 9586.89s]  Oh, my goodness.
[9586.89s -> 9590.74s]  OK.
[9590.74s -> 9591.44s]  Oh, my god.
[9600.12s -> 9600.62s]  Ah.
[9612.94s -> 9616.47s]  Honestly, there's something about anybody else feel like this.
[9616.47s -> 9619.73s]  It feels just so wrong.
[9619.73s -> 9626.84s]  Watching Leon get killed is so fucked up looking, isn't it?
[9626.84s -> 9629.84s]  Because everybody knows it's like watching the main character
[9629.84s -> 9632.74s]  just get killed so violently.
[9632.74s -> 9634.24s]  Like, Leon doesn't die.
[9634.24s -> 9636.94s]  He's in Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil 6,
[9636.94s -> 9639.34s]  Resident Evil 10, probably.
[9639.34s -> 9642.24s]  He's such an iconic character that watching some random guy
[9642.24s -> 9652.27s]  snap his neck is just so strange looking.
[9652.27s -> 9653.47s]  Turn the difficulty down?
[9653.47s -> 9658.11s]  What?
[9658.11s -> 9658.61s]  All right.
[9658.61s -> 9659.61s]  No, this is the hard part.
[9659.61s -> 9668.34s]  I got it.
[9668.34s -> 9669.14s]  Let's go.
[9669.14s -> 9675.60s]  Against two of us.
[9675.60s -> 9677.00s]  Oh, and that's nothing yet.
[9677.00s -> 9679.50s]  This fuck is made up of monsters.
[9679.50s -> 9681.50s]  You done warming up?
[9681.50s -> 9685.00s]  Hope you strip.
[9685.00s -> 9686.36s]  Yeah.
[9686.36s -> 9700.09s]  Now, if you'd shut up, we'd be good to go.
[9700.09s -> 9700.99s]  Just come upstairs.
[9700.99s -> 9701.89s]  Go upstairs.
[9701.89s -> 9702.59s]  Upstairs, upstairs.
[9702.59s -> 9704.09s]  Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[9704.09s -> 9714.94s]  Go upstairs.
[9714.94s -> 9724.08s]  We're doing left for dead bathroom scraps.
[9724.08s -> 9792.33s]  Here we go.
[9792.33s -> 9824.49s]  You all right down there?
[9824.49s -> 9825.69s]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[9825.69s -> 9827.06s]  Upstairs.
[9827.06s -> 9828.36s]  Upstairs, now.
[9828.36s -> 9828.96s]  Now.
[9828.96s -> 9832.00s]  Go.
[9832.00s -> 9832.80s]  Upstairs, now.
[9886.96s -> 9893.58s]  All right, now we're going to go up, up, up, up, up.
[9893.58s -> 9901.79s]  All the way up.
[9901.79s -> 9902.39s]  Oh, shit.
[9902.39s -> 9903.79s]  You might need some company.
[9903.79s -> 9904.99s]  Oh, shit.
[9904.99s -> 9906.29s]  Are you coming?
[9906.29s -> 9907.69s]  That's not even you, dude.
[9907.69s -> 9909.69s]  How are you up here already?
[9909.69s -> 9936.39s]  Why am I talking like we're in voice comms together?
[9936.39s -> 9942.52s]  Oh, no.
[9942.52s -> 9945.69s]  Where is he?
[9945.69s -> 9950.40s]  Is that him?
[9950.40s -> 9951.10s]  What is?
[9951.10s -> 9955.95s]  What's happening?
[9955.95s -> 9956.65s]  Go, go down.
[9956.65s -> 9978.73s]  Go down.
[9978.73s -> 9990.96s]  Oh, my fuck.
[9990.96s -> 9995.28s]  I can't even.
[9995.28s -> 10002.37s]  Oh, that was lucky.
[10002.37s -> 10011.92s]  So many people are coming down here.
[10011.92s -> 10012.82s]  Push through, buddy.
[10051.27s -> 10052.67s]  I'm fucking dead here.
[10052.67s -> 10065.64s]  He's going to hit me right in the head.
[10065.64s -> 10067.34s]  Get the fuck away from me, dude.
[10067.34s -> 10074.30s]  Get away from me.
[10074.30s -> 10076.47s]  Oh, my god.
[10076.47s -> 10086.04s]  What do you mean pay attention?
[10086.04s -> 10087.14s]  Don't just leave me.
[10087.14s -> 10087.74s]  OK.
[10087.74s -> 10092.10s]  Wait, I didn't kill that guy.
[10092.10s -> 10097.59s]  No, I missed out on an item.
[10097.59s -> 10105.54s]  I missed out on an item.
[10105.54s -> 10107.04s]  You are the reason why the devs put
[10107.04s -> 10108.54s]  bright yellow paint on everything.
[10108.54s -> 10111.44s]  No, it's because the contrast of the new graphics
[10111.44s -> 10114.94s]  made having the barrels be a lighter color
[10114.94s -> 10116.44s]  be kind of distracting.
[10116.44s -> 10119.04s]  And they changed it for that reason.
[10119.04s -> 10120.94s]  They changed it because it was contrast.
[10120.94s -> 10122.24s]  Go look at the dev notes, OK?
[10122.24s -> 10126.22s]  I don't have to tell you this.
[10126.22s -> 10127.52s]  You want to start explaining?
[10127.52s -> 10137.20s]  The cough is caused by something called a plaga.
[10137.20s -> 10140.91s]  You saw those people, right?
[10140.91s -> 10143.71s]  But you have the same thing inside you,
[10143.71s -> 10147.26s]  the same thing that made them that.
[10147.26s -> 10150.90s]  This is what you're experiencing, these symptoms.
[10150.90s -> 10152.87s]  They're only the beginning.
[10152.87s -> 10155.23s]  I don't want to become like them.
[10155.23s -> 10159.57s]  You are, well, you see, at this early stage,
[10159.57s -> 10162.04s]  the parasite, the plaga.
[10162.04s -> 10166.90s]  It is possible to remove it with the surgical procedure.
[10166.90s -> 10168.90s]  And all you need is some know-how.
[10168.90s -> 10172.17s]  And oh, yeah, the right equipment.
[10172.17s -> 10173.47s]  Wait, you too?
[10173.47s -> 10176.52s]  No worries.
[10176.52s -> 10179.67s]  See, I have a plan.
[10179.67s -> 10187.03s]  But you're going to have to trust me.
[10187.03s -> 10187.63s]  Great.
[10187.63s -> 10189.03s]  We're partners, then.
[10189.03s -> 10189.73s]  Hey, why are you?
[10189.73s -> 10190.73s]  No time for any questions.
[10190.73s -> 10192.60s]  The clock is ticking.
[10192.60s -> 10194.50s]  Why are you helping us?
[10194.50s -> 10196.10s]  Because it makes me feel better.
[10196.10s -> 10198.00s]  Let's leave it at that.
[10198.00s -> 10200.80s]  I will contact you later.
[10200.80s -> 10210.12s]  Dress as this Leon for Halloween.
[10210.12s -> 10213.02s]  I'm sad I didn't, I used a bunch of ammo on it.
[10213.02s -> 10235.21s]  I didn't even kill the pig mask person.
[10235.21s -> 10245.19s]  Eyes are so red.
[10245.19s -> 10248.42s]  Hey, got a smoke?
[10248.42s -> 10251.02s]  I do, the kind you like.
[10251.02s -> 10253.56s]  Now where's the amber?
[10253.56s -> 10256.64s]  Fortunately, it's not on me at the moment.
[10256.64s -> 10261.74s]  And you really should be telling me what a good job I did.
[10261.74s -> 10265.54s]  Busted my ass and managed to hide it right before I got caught.
[10265.54s -> 10266.64s]  Ada.
[10266.64s -> 10272.22s]  Which is why I'm still alive.
[10272.22s -> 10276.62s]  The deal was we get you out of here when you deliver the amber.
[10276.62s -> 10281.32s]  No amber, no protection, Luis.
[10281.32s -> 10285.71s]  Such a stickler for details, huh, Ada?
[10285.71s -> 10287.63s]  Okay, then.
[10287.63s -> 10288.43s]  I'll go get it now.
[10288.43s -> 10301.34s]  How about that?
[10301.34s -> 10306.32s]  And I do have something else I need to get, too.
[10306.32s -> 10311.14s]  Somebody asked, is this as good as the original?
[10311.14s -> 10312.14s]  This is Roost.
[10312.14s -> 10315.30s]  Got some bad news, Condor One.
[10315.30s -> 10318.70s]  With the weather like this, the chopper can't make its approach.
[10318.70s -> 10320.70s]  Can you stand by until it clears?
[10320.70s -> 10321.30s]  Negative.
[10321.30s -> 10322.70s]  Too dangerous.
[10322.70s -> 10325.20s]  We're going to get out of here and find someplace safe.
[10325.20s -> 10326.20s]  I'm sorry.
[10326.20s -> 10328.40s]  I wish I could do more to help.
[10328.40s -> 10329.30s]  Don't worry about it.
[10329.30s -> 10331.30s]  We'll swim home if we have to.
[10331.30s -> 10333.50s]  Condor One, out.
[10333.50s -> 10337.15s]  Let's go.
[10337.15s -> 10339.15s]  What's going to happen to me?
[10339.15s -> 10343.53s]  Right now, let's just focus on getting out of here.
[10343.53s -> 10344.73s]  Yeah.
[10344.73s -> 10346.13s]  Any more eggs?
[10346.13s -> 10364.03s]  No.
[10364.13s -> 10372.03s]  Okay, so is this as good as the original?
[10372.03s -> 10377.08s]  The answer is yes, because it is the original.
[10377.08s -> 10378.28s]  You know what I mean?
[10378.28s -> 10381.99s]  They didn't change that much.
[10381.99s -> 10386.36s]  There was enough changes for it to be kind of a different experience,
[10386.36s -> 10390.26s]  but it still is the same game.
[10390.26s -> 10396.41s]  It's just kind of updated.
[10396.41s -> 10400.23s]  I think there's still reasons to play the original,
[10400.23s -> 10401.63s]  but I love it.
[10401.63s -> 10407.54s]  I think it's amazing.
[10407.54s -> 10408.74s]  I think it's impossible to say,
[10408.74s -> 10410.84s]  well, yeah, this replaces Resident Evil 4.
[10410.84s -> 10417.00s]  I don't think that's accurate, but it's still kind of...
[10417.00s -> 10423.06s]  I'm having a fantastic time.
[10423.06s -> 10441.95s]  Centrist Andy.
[10441.95s -> 10455.61s]  I already know this.
[10455.61s -> 10459.72s]  It's kind of the same thing with...
[10459.72s -> 10463.38s]  All right, let's see if I can describe this.
[10463.38s -> 10466.91s]  We all have memories playing the old games,
[10466.91s -> 10471.82s]  and I feel like something like Diablo 2 Remastered is like this too.
[10471.82s -> 10474.91s]  When I'm walking around playing this,
[10475.01s -> 10478.81s]  it's almost like the way that I remember the old one.
[10478.81s -> 10482.01s]  It's like back then, it's almost like...
[10482.01s -> 10486.74s]  This is the way that it looked to me in a weird way.
[10486.74s -> 10487.64s]  It's like, oh, yeah, of course.
[10487.64s -> 10489.74s]  This is the same game.
[10489.74s -> 10492.74s]  I feel like I'm playing the same thing.
[10492.74s -> 10496.94s]  I feel the same kind of way with Diablo 2 Resurrected.
[10496.94s -> 10502.74s]  It's like I feel like back when I played Diablo 2,
[10502.74s -> 10504.14s]  the game's graphics were great.
[10504.14s -> 10504.94s]  Like, this is awesome.
[10505.04s -> 10507.24s]  It's like current-gen and everything's fanned out.
[10507.24s -> 10509.86s]  Wow, look at the lighting effects.
[10509.86s -> 10513.76s]  Going back and playing any amount of Diablo 2 Resurrected now.
[10513.76s -> 10514.86s]  Oh, wow, look at all these graphics.
[10514.86s -> 10516.06s]  Look at the lighting effects.
[10516.06s -> 10517.56s]  It's like the same...
[10517.56s -> 10524.25s]  It's in the same place in my brain.
[10524.25s -> 10527.35s]  If you showed me two images side-by-side of this game,
[10527.35s -> 10528.85s]  I would very much be able to go,
[10528.85s -> 10530.35s]  whoa, that's way, way different,
[10530.35s -> 10530.85s]  but I don't...
[10530.85s -> 10533.25s]  My brain is telling me that it's not the case.
[10533.25s -> 10536.05s]  This is the same experience that you remember,
[10536.05s -> 10538.25s]  and isn't it fucking awesome?
[10538.25s -> 10544.68s]  So that's kind of the way I feel.
[10544.68s -> 10546.38s]  All right, I'm going to sell some stuff.
[10553.68s -> 10562.49s]  Ooh, but I feel like I'm going to sell that soon.
[10562.49s -> 10570.77s]  I feel like I'm going to get another handgun soon.
[10570.77s -> 10573.97s]  Nostalgia makes things often seem better than they were.
[10573.97s -> 10574.37s]  That's what I mean.
[10574.37s -> 10576.27s]  It's you have this layer of nostalgia,
[10576.27s -> 10579.06s]  and somebody's kind of painting over it.
[10579.06s -> 10581.56s]  It's like you have this nostalgia memory
[10581.56s -> 10586.36s]  that is being kind of traced with much better ink,
[10586.36s -> 10589.36s]  and it kind of replaces that part of your brain
[10589.36s -> 10593.46s]  that remembers the nostalgia.
[10593.46s -> 10594.76s]  They both operate very well.
[10594.76s -> 10597.30s]  They both operate in the same spot.
[10597.30s -> 10599.49s]  I'm going to buy this.
[10599.49s -> 10608.76s]  You can't go wrong with that.
[10608.76s -> 10611.19s]  It's like finding an old book,
[10611.19s -> 10614.19s]  and the pages are all fucked up,
[10614.19s -> 10617.29s]  and it's all dusty,
[10617.29s -> 10618.89s]  and you blow the dust off,
[10618.89s -> 10619.49s]  you clean it up,
[10619.49s -> 10621.39s]  you send it to a restoring agency,
[10621.39s -> 10622.49s]  whatever, and they restore it,
[10622.49s -> 10623.39s]  and you get to read it again.
[10623.39s -> 10625.53s]  You go, holy shit, this is great.
[10625.53s -> 10626.33s]  I remember this book.
[10626.33s -> 10631.57s]  It looks great now.
[10631.57s -> 10632.97s]  I don't think I want any of this stuff.
[10632.97s -> 10634.61s]  Maybe the diamond.
[10643.88s -> 10645.18s]  Double yellow in here, probably.
[10645.18s -> 10646.51s]  Yeah.
[10654.05s -> 10660.83s]  Is any of these worth more than the other or no?
[10660.83s -> 10661.73s]  So usually they are.
[10661.73s -> 10663.13s]  Okay, so yeah, they are.
[10663.13s -> 10664.33s]  Red is not as valuable.
[10664.33s -> 10667.87s]  Red is more valuable than purple.
[10667.87s -> 10670.50s]  Purple, green.
[10670.50s -> 10674.11s]  Green and red.
[10674.11s -> 10674.61s]  There we go.
[10674.61s -> 10682.05s]  Okay, 19, 8.
[10682.05s -> 10684.45s]  And I could do two yellows.
[10684.45s -> 10685.85s]  Is yellow worth a lot?
[10685.85s -> 10688.97s]  7,000.
[10688.97s -> 10690.37s]  I'm going to get another yellow.
[10690.37s -> 10691.37s]  Two yellows.
[10705.94s -> 10706.74s]  Nice.
[10706.74s -> 10709.90s]  All right, big money coming in.
[10709.90s -> 10713.66s]  Put the purple back in.
[10713.66s -> 10720.75s]  Purple was 4, wasn't it?
[10720.75s -> 10733.40s]  Or shift on the gem screen.
[10733.40s -> 10735.30s]  Three colors, trio.
[10735.30s -> 10736.90s]  Two duos.
[10736.90s -> 10739.40s]  Four colors, quartet.
[10739.40s -> 10740.30s]  Duo and trio.
[10740.30s -> 10741.90s]  All right, so we need...
[10741.90s -> 10742.40s]  This is a...
[10742.40s -> 10743.30s]  This is two.
[10743.30s -> 10751.67s]  So this is...
[10751.67s -> 10753.99s]  I mean, I don't...
[10753.99s -> 10755.89s]  A duo is better, but I don't...
[10755.89s -> 10757.09s]  I only have...
[10757.09s -> 10758.80s]  It's fine.
[10758.80s -> 10759.50s]  It's fine.
[10767.50s -> 10772.35s]  It's fine.
[10776.35s -> 10777.05s]  Yes!
[10777.05s -> 10778.45s]  New shotgun.
[10780.45s -> 10783.48s]  $28,000, though.
[10783.48s -> 10794.98s]  All right, sell the other shotgun.
[10794.98s -> 10797.18s]  $76,000.
[10797.18s -> 10804.23s]  That's a lot.
[10806.80s -> 10807.70s]  Here we go.
[10819.30s -> 10825.87s]  Cool.
[10825.87s -> 10828.57s]  Now we're going to upgrade the absolute hell out of this.
[10828.57s -> 10829.17s]  Power?
[10830.17s -> 10833.27s]  We're starting to get an idea of your tastes.
[10833.27s -> 10834.57s]  Power again.
[10834.57s -> 10835.07s]  Max it out.
[10835.07s -> 10836.77s]  See how that feels, mate.
[10836.77s -> 10839.77s]  A fellow like yourself should notice the difference right away.
[10839.77s -> 10840.87s]  Ammo.
[10840.87s -> 10841.77s]  There you are.
[10841.77s -> 10842.17s]  Do it all.
[10842.17s -> 10843.67s]  As you wish.
[10843.67s -> 10845.47s]  Dazzled, are you?
[10845.47s -> 10846.37s]  Ha ha.
[10846.37s -> 10847.17s]  Our craftsmanship marks no less.
[10847.17s -> 10849.07s]  Max upgraded, uh...
[10849.07s -> 10850.17s]  Riot Gun.
[10850.17s -> 10861.41s]  That's good work if I do say so myself.
[10861.41s -> 10866.99s]  Do I have any more things to sell?
[10866.99s -> 10871.06s]  Your vows won't do you much good in the grave.
[10871.06s -> 10891.24s]  Thank you.
[10891.24s -> 10891.94s]  If you want...
[10891.94s -> 10893.74s]  See how that feels, mate.
[10893.74s -> 10895.14s]  I'm not going to use...
[10895.14s -> 10897.44s]  I'm not going to use it.
[10897.44s -> 10901.04s]  I'm using handgun and shotgun.
[10901.04s -> 10904.96s]  And maybe the bolt shooter.
[10904.96s -> 10908.29s]  I'm not going to use the submachine gun this whole game.
[10908.29s -> 10911.34s]  Come back anytime.
[10911.34s -> 10915.78s]  Look at this thing.
[10915.78s -> 10917.52s]  Who sells ammo?
[10917.52s -> 10921.94s]  I know I'm not going to be using it.
[10921.94s -> 10934.28s]  All right, I'm changing the outfits.
[10934.28s -> 10935.08s]  I need more...
[10935.08s -> 10938.08s]  Whoa, that was a weird sound.
[10938.08s -> 10949.56s]  Oh, there's more of this.
[10949.56s -> 10951.66s]  Need some yellow herbs.
[10951.66s -> 10959.00s]  I'm golden.
[10959.00s -> 10960.30s]  All right, let me, uh...
[10960.30s -> 10969.43s]  We're going to change outfits.
[10969.43s -> 10971.98s]  Should I try the other stuff or...
[10971.98s -> 10979.10s]  I want to see what the other stuff looks like.
[10979.10s -> 10979.50s]  I kind of...
[10979.50s -> 10983.80s]  I kind of like this one.
[10983.80s -> 10992.08s]  Yeah, this is like a Resident Evil 2.
[10992.08s -> 11005.08s]  Hmm.
[11005.08s -> 11008.48s]  Finally, glasses off.
[11008.48s -> 11016.59s]  Yeah.
[11016.59s -> 11022.68s]  Okay, cool.
[11022.68s -> 11025.54s]  We're good.
[11025.54s -> 11034.09s]  Play with this for a little while.
[11034.09s -> 11040.15s]  Reload the guns and let's continue the video game.
[11040.15s -> 11043.99s]  I have nine mines to attach.
[11043.99s -> 11049.48s]  Wow.
[11049.48s -> 11052.96s]  All right.
[11052.96s -> 11059.72s]  I can make some more shotgun bullets.
[11059.72s -> 11061.22s]  Joggun is going to carry this whole playthrough,
[11061.22s -> 11065.12s]  so I want to make sure I have always have bullets for it.
[11065.12s -> 11070.26s]  All right.
[11070.26s -> 11080.17s]  There is something over here.
[11080.17s -> 11084.39s]  Well, it would be nice to have that.
[11084.39s -> 11085.69s]  Can we get a Mr. Bean impression?
[11085.69s -> 11087.80s]  Yeah, sure.
[11087.80s -> 11089.10s]  Oh.
[11089.10s -> 11090.44s]  Oh.
[11090.44s -> 11091.74s]  Oh.
[11091.74s -> 11092.84s]  Oh.
[11092.84s -> 11136.93s]  Oh.
[11136.93s -> 11138.33s]  What?
[11138.33s -> 11139.53s]  Don't scream.
[11139.53s -> 11140.53s]  What's happening?
[11140.53s -> 11144.07s]  Why is there a train coming?
[11144.07s -> 11150.10s]  What's going on?
[11150.10s -> 11156.18s]  Fucking dead.
[11156.18s -> 11159.02s]  Oh, no, Leon.
[11159.02s -> 11161.52s]  What do you do if you're Ashley in that scenario?
[11161.52s -> 11162.42s]  Do you?
[11162.42s -> 11165.10s]  What do you do?
[11165.10s -> 11166.40s]  You just run?
[11166.40s -> 11168.80s]  You pick up the riot shotgun and just start firing?
[11168.80s -> 11169.20s]  I don't know.
[11169.20s -> 11169.90s]  What do you do?
[11169.90s -> 11179.16s]  I would, you know, I pick up the gun and start shooting.
[11179.16s -> 11180.16s]  I have so much shit on me.
[11180.16s -> 11182.82s]  I feel like I would be a Diablo enemy.
[11182.82s -> 11186.52s]  That head comes off and it's just like six items dropped.
[11186.52s -> 11191.24s]  It's like two or three legendary indicators.
[11191.24s -> 11197.80s]  Is this?
[11197.80s -> 11198.40s]  All right.
[11198.40s -> 11200.18s]  Okay.
[11200.18s -> 11202.68s]  Does it count that I picked up the ammo?
[11202.68s -> 11232.89s]  It does.
[11232.89s -> 11234.29s]  What the hell happened?
[11234.29s -> 11249.06s]  We stepped in the trap.
[11249.06s -> 11250.60s]  Let's go.
[11250.60s -> 11251.50s]  Okay.
[11261.22s -> 11262.82s]  We're doing this.
[11270.59s -> 11272.26s]  Give me space.
[11272.26s -> 11273.26s]  With me.
[11273.26s -> 11274.56s]  Oh, wow.
[11274.56s -> 11276.36s]  Oh, whoa.
[11276.36s -> 11277.96s]  Oh, this is one of those.
[11277.96s -> 11291.03s]  He's running.
[11291.03s -> 11304.34s]  This thing is powerful.
[11304.34s -> 11305.04s]  Watch out.
[11305.04s -> 11328.05s]  Oh, my God.
[11328.05s -> 11329.45s]  Will you fuck off?
[11329.45s -> 11373.14s]  Up all this stuff.
[11373.14s -> 11382.24s]  You all right?
[11382.24s -> 11382.74s]  Another grenade.
[11382.74s -> 11384.72s]  Do I have any more eggs?
[11384.72s -> 11389.82s]  Don't.
[11389.82s -> 11391.13s]  Why does it say?
[11391.13s -> 11393.83s]  Oh, I keep that keeps confusing me.
[11393.83s -> 11411.50s]  I only have one but the four means it's in the slot number four.
[11411.50s -> 11427.42s]  Cool.
[11427.42s -> 11428.92s]  Give me some space.
[11428.92s -> 11432.56s]  Okay.
[11432.56s -> 11434.08s]  Come on.
[11434.08s -> 11439.56s]  Hang on.
[11458.83s -> 11460.73s]  Dude, Chalice of Atonement.
[11460.73s -> 11462.23s]  There's a lot of slots in here.
[11462.23s -> 11463.44s]  Spread out.
[11463.44s -> 11480.90s]  Let's go.
[11480.90s -> 11482.80s]  That looks like real fire.
[11482.80s -> 11485.70s]  My eyes actually feel the same way when I look at a real flame.
[11486.54s -> 11505.20s]  Kind of intense.
[11505.20s -> 11506.00s]  What should we take a second?
[11506.00s -> 11525.12s]  Are you all right?
[11525.12s -> 11525.92s]  Catch your breath.
[11525.92s -> 11529.24s]  Sure is quiet.
[11529.24s -> 11589.37s]  Okay, we're good.
[11589.37s -> 11590.27s]  Kill.
[11590.27s -> 11607.50s]  I think that's all of them.
[11607.50s -> 11613.72s]  Locked.
[11613.72s -> 11615.86s]  Well, shit.
[11615.86s -> 11616.86s]  How come you're not suplexing?
[11616.86s -> 11620.32s]  Zero suplexes.
[11620.32s -> 11622.48s]  How do you do a suplex?
[11622.48s -> 11640.66s]  Is it just melee from a different angle?
[11640.66s -> 11658.83s]  All right, I've got a max heel.
[11658.83s -> 11661.00s]  Get it loaded.
[11661.00s -> 11674.44s]  I'm going to use this for a little while.
[11674.44s -> 11687.60s]  What?
[11687.60s -> 11712.28s]  I'm having her play a horror game.
[11712.28s -> 11712.88s]  Every horror game.
[11712.88s -> 11725.45s]  You go into the locker like that and then you just that happens every time.
[11725.45s -> 11730.17s]  Oh, that's not good.
[11730.17s -> 11731.87s]  Why did you do a backflip?
[11731.87s -> 11734.55s]  Unless it was yours.
[11734.55s -> 11740.46s]  Lady type guy.
[11740.46s -> 11741.76s]  Can I go in?
[11741.76s -> 11742.36s]  Oh, fuck.
[11742.36s -> 11749.58s]  They're chasing me.
[11749.58s -> 11776.16s]  Get this fucking guy out of the way.
[11776.16s -> 11801.43s]  Fuck.
[11801.43s -> 11802.13s]  Stay down.
[11802.13s -> 11803.43s]  All right.
[11803.43s -> 11805.63s]  I used all every fucking bullet.
[11805.63s -> 11814.72s]  Ow.
[11814.72s -> 11819.49s]  Oh my goodness.
[11824.62s -> 11829.64s]  I'm so dead.
[11829.64s -> 11831.24s]  What are you doing over here?
[11831.24s -> 11845.08s]  Get out of here.
[11845.08s -> 11845.38s]  What are you?
[11845.38s -> 11849.88s]  Get over here.
[11849.88s -> 11879.73s]  What are you stupid?
[11879.73s -> 11885.12s]  We're good.
[11885.12s -> 11885.72s]  I just look over.
[11885.72s -> 11888.72s]  She's just sprinting towards me.
[11888.72s -> 11891.54s]  There's two people with chainsaws here.
[11891.54s -> 11892.04s]  Oh, okay.
[11892.04s -> 11896.12s]  Checkpoint crank.
[11896.12s -> 11897.42s]  Wacky.
[11897.42s -> 11899.02s]  That shotgun is strong as...
[11899.02s -> 11900.68s]  Oh, yeah.
[11900.68s -> 11903.28s]  I put $150,000 into it.
[11903.28s -> 11910.62s]  I hope it is.
[11910.62s -> 11913.12s]  Out of a bullet support though.
[11913.12s -> 11914.22s]  Or am I?
[11914.22s -> 11917.42s]  Yes, I am.
[11917.42s -> 11918.32s]  Need some electrolytes?
[11918.32s -> 11922.50s]  I'm good.
[11922.50s -> 11924.10s]  Is there anything else here?
[11924.10s -> 11925.20s]  There is something here.
[11925.20s -> 11939.04s]  There's a couple things here, actually.
[11939.04s -> 11940.74s]  One more behind me?
[11940.74s -> 11941.44s]  Right here?
[11941.44s -> 11942.84s]  Up there, I think.
[11942.84s -> 11948.16s]  Yeah.
[11948.16s -> 11950.26s]  I want to get up there and go across.
[11950.26s -> 11950.66s]  Yeah, I know.
[11950.66s -> 11951.86s]  Completionist Andy.
[11951.86s -> 11953.84s]  I know.
[11953.84s -> 11957.08s]  I know.
[11957.08s -> 11963.15s]  Is there a way to get up there from around?
[11963.15s -> 11964.25s]  I like the jacket.
[11964.25s -> 11967.28s]  I actually do like this outfit.
[11967.28s -> 11971.94s]  I definitely want to get up there because this is one of those things.
[11971.94s -> 11984.21s]  So I'm going to go up this building.
[11984.21s -> 11986.30s]  Do something silly.
[11986.30s -> 11989.33s]  Nah.
[11989.33s -> 12011.14s]  Nah.
[12011.14s -> 12016.30s]  That's how you get that.
[12016.30s -> 12022.80s]  Okay, now I'm going to go up.
[12022.80s -> 12023.70s]  Oh, shit.
[12023.70s -> 12025.26s]  It's okay.
[12025.26s -> 12029.93s]  At least I got those items too.
[12029.93s -> 12032.97s]  It was very un-silly of you.
[12032.97s -> 12035.44s]  That's all right though.
[12035.44s -> 12048.28s]  Okay, I want to go up here.
[12048.28s -> 12051.06s]  Goofing off.
[12051.06s -> 12062.31s]  I like goofing off.
[12062.31s -> 12063.90s]  Nice.
[12063.90s -> 12071.04s]  Elegant headdress.
[12071.04s -> 12072.94s]  Let us continue.
[12072.94s -> 12073.74s]  All right.
[12073.74s -> 12077.18s]  I got to go in there.
[12077.18s -> 12093.72s]  I just dropped down.
[12093.72s -> 12099.10s]  I need to find another place to draw it open.
[12099.10s -> 12104.24s]  Fox and Space 2 episode 2 just aired.
[12104.24s -> 12109.05s]  Are you hurt?
[12109.05s -> 12111.65s]  I wonder if I'm in it.
[12111.65s -> 12112.35s]  I wonder if I'm in it.
[12112.35s -> 12114.05s]  Seems this isn't the first time running from creeps.
[12114.05s -> 12118.76s]  That's meant to be a compliment.
[12118.76s -> 12121.27s]  Yeah, it was really cool.
[12121.27s -> 12126.74s]  It was really, really cool to do that.
[12126.74s -> 12127.84s]  I won't spoil anything.
[12127.84s -> 12130.31s]  But Fox and Space 2.
[12130.31s -> 12138.62s]  Go check it out.
[12138.62s -> 12139.72s]  This is a normal playthrough.
[12139.72s -> 12155.86s]  Yeah, I mean, it's barely normal.
[12155.86s -> 12157.93s]  Are you actually being serious?
[12157.93s -> 12162.60s]  You're gonna have to go watch it and find out.
[12162.60s -> 12163.30s]  I could be making it up.
[12163.30s -> 12167.31s]  You better go watch it.
[12167.31s -> 12183.00s]  You should watch it anyways.
[12183.00s -> 12191.56s]  All right.
[12191.56s -> 12194.92s]  Do I have enough to make any shotgun shells?
[12194.92s -> 12199.07s]  Yes, I do.
[12199.07s -> 12211.26s]  Used every single bullet on the two chainsaw ladies.
[12211.26s -> 12225.88s]  Can I do it again?
[12225.88s -> 12226.84s]  All right.
[12226.84s -> 12227.82s]  Come on.
[12227.82s -> 12232.66s]  Okay.
[12236.10s -> 12238.00s]  Oh yeah, this guy again.
[12255.44s -> 12257.24s]  It's made out of aluminum foil.
[12257.24s -> 12259.54s]  Not even that impressive.
[12259.54s -> 12266.41s]  You're not fooling anybody.
[12266.41s -> 12266.91s]  Come on, come on.
[12266.91s -> 12275.12s]  Hurry, go, go, go, go, go.
[12275.12s -> 12275.82s]  What?
[12275.82s -> 12291.41s]  All right.
[12291.41s -> 12291.91s]  I did.
[12291.91s -> 12292.41s]  All right.
[12292.41s -> 12299.32s]  Whatever.
[12299.32s -> 12300.42s]  What a hero.
[12319.54s -> 12328.30s]  Uh-oh.
[12328.30s -> 12338.63s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[12338.63s -> 12339.73s]  I thought she was already...
[12339.73s -> 12345.38s]  I didn't know if she could get hit by that.
[12345.38s -> 12351.18s]  I didn't know if that counted as damage to her.
[12351.18s -> 12352.08s]  She was already down.
[12352.08s -> 12362.77s]  I figured I would...
[12362.77s -> 12364.27s]  Just kill me.
[12364.27s -> 12368.26s]  Just...
[12368.26s -> 12368.96s]  Just kill me already.
[12368.96s -> 12380.28s]  I want to restart.
[12381.48s -> 12383.98s]  She's screaming.
[12388.59s -> 12389.90s]  Stay back.
[12389.90s -> 12391.20s]  Ashley, watch out.
[12402.74s -> 12414.53s]  I want to get it.
[12414.53s -> 12416.73s]  I want to restart.
[12416.73s -> 12454.58s]  An arrow sticking right out of his head.
[12454.58s -> 12457.39s]  Get out of the fucking way.
[12457.39s -> 12463.12s]  The bridge.
[12463.12s -> 12465.62s]  Ashley, pick up as many fucking items as you can.
[12465.62s -> 12472.24s]  Ashley.
[12472.24s -> 12473.54s]  I...
[12473.54s -> 12474.04s]  God.
[12474.04s -> 12477.90s]  I want the item so bad.
[12477.90s -> 12478.20s]  All right.
[12478.20s -> 12478.60s]  No more fucking...
[12478.60s -> 12479.20s]  I just run.
[12479.20s -> 12479.60s]  I know.
[12479.60s -> 12480.00s]  I just want...
[12480.00s -> 12484.42s]  There was like $2,000 on the ground.
[12484.42s -> 12488.83s]  I know you just got to go, but I just wanted money.
[12488.83s -> 12490.03s]  I promise I'm not going to fuck around.
[12490.03s -> 12491.43s]  I'll get it right now.
[12521.10s -> 12521.50s]  Get up there.
[12521.50s -> 12522.60s]  Go.
[12522.60s -> 12524.00s]  What's going on?
[12524.00s -> 12525.40s]  What's going on?
[12525.40s -> 12526.80s]  Get up.
[12526.80s -> 12527.70s]  Get up there.
[12527.70s -> 12528.10s]  Go.
[12528.10s -> 12529.40s]  Jump up here.
[12529.40s -> 12530.60s]  Jump.
[12530.60s -> 12530.90s]  Jump.
[12530.90s -> 12531.20s]  Oh, go.
[12531.20s -> 12537.66s]  Not this way, actually.
[12537.66s -> 12539.16s]  The paint was all over the wall.
[12539.16s -> 12554.80s]  I thought it was go up.
[12554.80s -> 12565.62s]  I thought it was paint all over the wall.
[12565.62s -> 12569.12s]  Usually that means, hey, you need to look up and do...
[12569.12s -> 12572.62s]  I thought it meant like, hey, do the thing where you give her...
[12572.62s -> 12576.81s]  Do the hoist.
[12576.81s -> 12584.13s]  Get all the money over there.
[12584.13s -> 12586.10s]  You're the one he wants.
[12586.10s -> 12589.59s]  If we see him again, you...
[12589.59s -> 12590.99s]  What about you?
[12590.99s -> 12604.88s]  I'll do my job.
[12604.88s -> 12605.68s]  Glad to see you.
[12605.68s -> 12625.44s]  Break's over, I suppose.
[12625.44s -> 12628.46s]  $35,000.
[12628.46s -> 12636.40s]  That's pretty good.
[12636.40s -> 12637.10s]  Come.
[12637.10s -> 12638.00s]  Where would it?
[12638.00s -> 12642.53s]  What can I do you for?
[12642.53s -> 12643.63s]  Ruby's all rubbish.
[12643.63s -> 12645.33s]  It makes no difference.
[12645.33s -> 12646.33s]  The price?
[12646.33s -> 12649.64s]  Well, that's our choice to make.
[12649.64s -> 12654.68s]  It's pretty good cash.
[12654.68s -> 12665.62s]  Thank you.
[12665.62s -> 12666.32s]  This thing's good.
[12666.32s -> 12667.12s]  This thing is good.
[12667.12s -> 12668.12s]  I could put some more into this.
[12668.42s -> 12672.42s]  Can make up for a lack of skew, friend.
[12672.42s -> 12673.32s]  Dazzled.
[12673.32s -> 12673.82s]  Are you?
[12673.82s -> 12680.47s]  Good luck to you, stranger.
[12680.47s -> 12681.77s]  There you are.
[12681.77s -> 12686.63s]  As you wished.
[12686.63s -> 12689.96s]  Get the stock.
[12689.96s -> 12691.56s]  I have enough for you.
[12691.56s -> 12694.59s]  Back is killing.
[12694.59s -> 12697.29s]  Gun will look great with that.
[12697.29s -> 12703.85s]  Come back.
[12703.85s -> 12710.44s]  Where is it?
[12710.44s -> 12711.34s]  The time.
[12711.34s -> 12713.59s]  Okay.
[12713.59s -> 12720.31s]  Now.
[12720.31s -> 12722.11s]  Welcome.
[12722.11s -> 12725.96s]  Take some ammo.
[12725.96s -> 12727.16s]  Hey, I'm gonna get it.
[12727.16s -> 12728.96s]  Don't steal.
[12728.96s -> 12734.04s]  Remember that, mate.
[12734.04s -> 12741.25s]  Better to be over prepared.
[12741.25s -> 12744.59s]  Try that on for size.
[12744.59s -> 12745.49s]  Dazzled.
[12745.49s -> 12746.29s]  Are you?
[12746.29s -> 12746.69s]  All right.
[12746.69s -> 12750.52s]  Now this thing is pretty damn good.
[12750.52s -> 12752.82s]  I got one more upgrade for the knife.
[12752.82s -> 12755.52s]  This thing is going to be pretty decent now.
[12755.52s -> 12756.92s]  Everything else is fantastic.
[12756.92s -> 12758.62s]  I got all these upgrades.
[12758.62s -> 12761.12s]  Knife needs care every once in a while.
[12761.12s -> 12765.44s]  The difference between life and death.
[12765.44s -> 12770.52s]  Anything a pleasant travels.
[12770.52s -> 12774.56s]  Why do you have chicken strips in your inventory?
[12774.56s -> 12809.18s]  These?
[12809.18s -> 12810.64s]  Nice.
[12810.64s -> 12821.70s]  We're good.
[12821.70s -> 12826.99s]  Why are you so quiet and awkward?
[12826.99s -> 12830.18s]  I'm playing a game.
[12830.18s -> 12831.88s]  I'm awkward.
[12831.88s -> 12845.12s]  What do you mean awkward?
[12845.12s -> 12849.97s]  I'm going to use this for a little while.
[12849.97s -> 12850.77s]  He's new to streaming.
[12850.77s -> 12852.37s]  I just started streaming like a week ago.
[12852.37s -> 12878.82s]  I knew it was coming too.
[12878.82s -> 12882.52s]  Cease your pointless struggling.
[12882.52s -> 12888.06s]  Abandon your body to the will of our God.
[12888.16s -> 12891.26s]  This guy was creepy before.
[12891.26s -> 12893.36s]  I wonder how it is in the remake.
[12893.36s -> 12895.96s]  Oh, almighty.
[12895.96s -> 12901.28s]  Grant me the strength to crush your enemies.
[12901.28s -> 12903.80s]  Son of a bitch.
[12903.80s -> 12905.20s]  Ashley, run.
[12905.20s -> 12907.20s]  Okay.
[12907.20s -> 12915.85s]  Paso Luego.
[12915.85s -> 12922.22s]  God, I thank you for your gift.
[12922.22s -> 12922.72s]  Yeah.
[12922.72s -> 12925.06s]  You want to get ugly?
[12925.06s -> 12931.08s]  Let's get ugly.
[12931.08s -> 12952.28s]  Nice.
[12952.28s -> 12979.74s]  I gotta go up.
[12985.82s -> 12986.62s]  Oh, no.
[12986.62s -> 12990.00s]  Not into the fucking fire.
[12990.00s -> 12994.50s]  Get out of the fire.
[12994.50s -> 12996.53s]  Oh, shit.
[12996.53s -> 13030.83s]  Get out of the fire.
[13051.86s -> 13057.29s]  It worked.
[13057.29s -> 13061.09s]  I got him.
[13061.09s -> 13067.96s]  This shortcut is so strong.
[13067.96s -> 13095.67s]  Every single dollar has gone into this thing.
[13095.67s -> 13098.14s]  Give my regards to your God.
[13098.14s -> 13099.44s]  Any more?
[13099.44s -> 13102.44s]  No, no, no, no, not yet.
[13102.44s -> 13104.90s]  Yes, yes, I think there's items.
[13104.90s -> 13109.55s]  I didn't break a couple of boxes over here, right?
[13109.55s -> 13112.20s]  Yep.
[13112.20s -> 13112.80s]  I know.
[13112.80s -> 13113.20s]  Just wait.
[13113.20s -> 13128.35s]  I'm going to be fine.
[13128.35s -> 13130.25s]  I got 30 handgun bullets.
[13130.25s -> 13153.54s]  I was bound to catch their attention.
[13153.54s -> 13160.79s]  Okay.
[13160.79s -> 13161.39s]  You're doing fine.
[13161.39s -> 13163.62s]  Let's get moving.
[13163.62s -> 13167.34s]  Leon's going to turn into one of them, right?
[13167.34s -> 13168.64s]  I won't let that happen.
[13168.64s -> 13170.90s]  I promise.
[13170.90s -> 13172.50s]  Don't eat any food after midnight.
[13172.50s -> 13186.73s]  We'll be fine.
[13186.73s -> 13187.33s]  Oh, wait.
[13187.33s -> 13189.31s]  This is where...
[13189.31s -> 13193.01s]  I'm thinking of saying hello to you, Mr. Kennedy.
[13193.01s -> 13193.81s]  I think that...
[13193.81s -> 13195.70s]  Right?
[13195.70s -> 13205.85s]  What's this character's name?
[13205.85s -> 13214.79s]  Spoilers, spoilers.
[13214.79s -> 13219.36s]  Hair color red.
[13219.36s -> 13227.60s]  Wait, red hair for her?
[13227.60s -> 13233.12s]  I'm actually going to heal.
[13233.12s -> 13236.35s]  No, I'm not.
[13236.35s -> 13246.23s]  I'm making another one of these, though.
[13246.23s -> 13247.73s]  Spoilers for almost 20-year-old game.
[13247.73s -> 13258.12s]  Should have played it before, losers.
[13258.12s -> 13261.16s]  Put the red hair on.
[13261.16s -> 13267.23s]  At the next save point, I will...
[13267.23s -> 13271.70s]  Well, at least you don't have to worry about being followed.
[13271.70s -> 13300.08s]  Come on.
[13300.08s -> 13304.95s]  I'm going to pop out and change costumes.
[13304.95s -> 13309.42s]  Luis here.
[13309.42s -> 13311.38s]  You guys still around?
[13311.38s -> 13315.18s]  Well, I wanted to go home, but Ashley just had to see this castle first.
[13315.18s -> 13318.63s]  Perfect, because I have a present I want to give you.
[13318.63s -> 13321.33s]  Medicine that will help to suppress the progress of your problem.
[13321.33s -> 13323.33s]  You're going to play in the real man difficulty?
[13323.33s -> 13324.93s]  Let's see.
[13324.93s -> 13327.23s]  Come to the courtyard inside of the castle.
[13327.23s -> 13328.13s]  We can meet up there.
[13328.23s -> 13332.40s]  On a second playthrough, I would do that.
[13332.40s -> 13338.09s]  I have such a tension problem that playing on hardcore would be so bad on stream.
[13338.09s -> 13340.99s]  I would look over here, look at what chat said,
[13340.99s -> 13354.79s]  and I would just get an axe in the head and all my health would be gone.
[13354.79s -> 13371.86s]  This place is cool.
[13371.86s -> 13386.85s]  I just upgraded, so I guess this is probably a save point, maybe.
[13386.85s -> 13396.21s]  Vintage compass.
[13396.21s -> 13398.11s]  Everybody's kind of grunts in this game.
[13398.11s -> 13400.82s]  Even the merchant.
[13400.82s -> 13402.59s]  Everyone's just...
[13405.39s -> 13420.37s]  ...it might interest you.
[13420.37s -> 13422.73s]  Wait, there's so many handguns available.
[13422.73s -> 13427.04s]  Choosing the right one can be tricky.
[13427.04s -> 13428.14s]  Oooh.
[13428.14s -> 13429.83s]  The Punisher.
[13429.83s -> 13434.15s]  This one has a brilliant stability and penetration power.
[13434.15s -> 13436.15s]  The red nine, which is what I'm using.
[13436.15s -> 13440.72s]  A lot of power, but it kicks like a horse.
[13440.72s -> 13442.03s]  The Blacktail.
[13442.03s -> 13443.43s]  Quick shooting. It's compact size.
[13443.43s -> 13446.11s]  Also helps free up inventory space.
[13446.11s -> 13451.39s]  The Matilda.
[13451.39s -> 13458.12s]  Do you have that one in this castle?
[13458.12s -> 13461.62s]  Welcome. I've got something new for you.
[13461.62s -> 13474.22s]  That cash in your pocket, or your life. Easy choice, mate.
[13474.22s -> 13477.22s]  This thing is 30% off right now.
[13477.22s -> 13491.50s]  I always get the magnum when I save every bullet to the final boss.
[13491.50s -> 13498.50s]  Ruby's all rubbish, it makes no difference. The price, a deal well struck. Hehehe.
[13498.50s -> 13499.50s]  Damnit.
[13499.50s -> 13510.54s]  You'll get some bang for your buck, I guarantee it.
[13510.54s -> 13514.54s]  Your valuables won't do you much good in the grave.
[13514.54s -> 13524.38s]  Get rid of the bolt thrower?
[13524.38s -> 13530.89s]  I could, it's really, it's cool.
[13530.89s -> 13536.84s]  But, it's cool. It was a new weapon, I tried it for a while.
[13536.84s -> 13537.84s]  It was pretty cool.
[13537.84s -> 13547.16s]  But I'm getting the magnum and I'm gonna upgrade it to 100% so I can kill the boss in one shot.
[13547.16s -> 13557.06s]  But, hold on. I have these mines, I haven't even used them.
[13557.06s -> 13559.06s]  Maybe I will hold on to this.
[13559.06s -> 13564.58s]  I have to sell something to afford magnum, though.
[13564.58s -> 13567.08s]  Time is money, mate.
[13567.08s -> 13569.08s]  How much does it cost?
[13569.08s -> 13573.48s]  29,400 for the grenades.
[13573.48s -> 13577.48s]  Why not try your hand at a new gun, stranger?
[13577.48s -> 13579.48s]  That won't get me there.
[13579.48s -> 13586.48s]  Ruby's all rubbish, it makes no difference. The price, a deal well struck. That's our choice to make.
[13586.48s -> 13590.83s]  It's 1500.
[13590.83s -> 13595.35s]  I can certainly do something with this.
[13595.35s -> 13597.59s]  I could sell one of these.
[13597.59s -> 13599.96s]  That I'm just never gonna use.
[13599.96s -> 13604.70s]  I have doubles in a couple of them, don't I?
[13604.70s -> 13607.70s]  Your valuables won't do you much good in the grave.
[13607.70s -> 13609.70s]  Sell the ruby? I wanna keep all the gems.
[13609.70s -> 13615.24s]  I'm gonna sell one flash grenade.
[13615.24s -> 13617.74s]  Which will get me there.
[13617.74s -> 13619.23s]  Not bad.
[13619.23s -> 13621.23s]  Alright, let's do it.
[13621.23s -> 13626.01s]  Let us know when you've made some room.
[13626.01s -> 13630.63s]  Got cash in your pocket all your life. Easy.
[13630.63s -> 13636.60s]  I'm gonna store the magnum. I don't wanna use it yet.
[13648.97s -> 13650.97s]  Magnum ammo recipe.
[13650.97s -> 13652.97s]  Hell yeah.
[13652.97s -> 13662.97s]  Alright, the idea is to spend the rest of the game spending about $200,000.
[13662.97s -> 13667.97s]  Getting this all the way up so I can kill the last boss in four or five shots.
[13667.97s -> 13672.83s]  What does it take to make the magnum ammo?
[13672.83s -> 13678.21s]  A lot.
[13678.21s -> 13682.82s]  But I'm happy with that.
[13682.82s -> 13684.82s]  I'm gonna store it for now.
[13684.82s -> 13687.63s]  No sense in me taking it.
[13687.63s -> 13709.06s]  I can't use this.
[13709.06s -> 13714.07s]  I think I'm good.
[13714.07s -> 13716.07s]  The hair? I will, yep.
[13716.07s -> 13719.31s]  Wait, this is important.
[13719.31s -> 13726.94s]  Rifle craft ammo. Magnum ammo craft bonus frequency.
[13726.94s -> 13729.72s]  We want these on.
[13729.72s -> 13744.22s]  Because when I craft magnum ammo, I'm gonna get extra.
[13744.22s -> 13749.96s]  I also want to increase the drop rate for gunpowder.
[13749.96s -> 13768.03s]  Because it takes a lot of gunpowder to make magnum ammo.
[13768.03s -> 13771.03s]  I do make shotgun shells as well.
[13771.03s -> 13780.94s]  Although, is it? I think I'm alright.
[13780.94s -> 13781.94s]  Alright, we're gonna put the red hair on.
[13781.94s -> 13788.85s]  Sell every gun except for the magnum.
[13788.85s -> 13791.09s]  I will not be able to complete the game.
[13791.09s -> 13802.12s]  Okay.
[13802.12s -> 13808.01s]  Now, I'm gonna keep this one on.
[13808.01s -> 13841.58s]  I think I'm playing Castlevania or something.
[13841.58s -> 13846.41s]  Alright.
[13846.41s -> 13848.65s]  So, things are looking good.
[13848.65s -> 13863.63s]  Let's go.
[13863.63s -> 13867.69s]  Jesus.
[13867.69s -> 13869.69s]  The fuck was that?
[13869.69s -> 13871.86s]  I don't know if you guys heard that.
[13871.86s -> 13878.46s]  He put gunner optics on.
[13878.46s -> 13891.60s]  Don't heal Leon.
[13891.60s -> 13892.60s]  We want him to suffer.
[13892.60s -> 13893.60s]  Not always down.
[13893.60s -> 13912.31s]  It's 2020, it's for you, dude.
[13912.31s -> 13914.31s]  You have to start streaming in 1080p.
[13914.31s -> 13925.00s]  If I can start streaming in 10,000 bit rate, I will.
[13925.00s -> 13939.51s]  Oh.
[13939.51s -> 13941.51s]  What?
[13941.51s -> 13945.31s]  No.
[13945.31s -> 13946.31s]  I shot it twice.
[13946.31s -> 13953.93s]  Oh my god.
[13953.93s -> 13975.42s]  Well, let's try that again.
[13975.42s -> 13976.42s]  Oh, that's right.
[13976.42s -> 13977.42s]  They did do...
[13977.42s -> 13978.42s]  What did they say?
[13978.42s -> 13981.64s]  They went like...
[13981.64s -> 13984.94s]  Something like that, right?
[13984.94s -> 13987.38s]  I'm hearing...
[13987.38s -> 14011.53s]  Boot knife.
[14011.53s -> 14021.02s]  It's so quiet.
[14021.02s -> 14050.58s]  Does this break the durability?
[14050.58s -> 14073.13s]  It doesn't look like it.
[14073.13s -> 14080.13s]  That hit.
[14080.13s -> 14081.30s]  Thanks.
[14089.20s -> 14090.20s]  Ashley.
[14090.20s -> 14092.78s]  You okay?
[14092.78s -> 14093.78s]  Yeah.
[14093.78s -> 14094.78s]  Oh shit.
[14094.78s -> 14103.38s]  You alright?
[14103.38s -> 14104.38s]  Nice shot.
[14104.38s -> 14134.49s]  Just like through the fucking head.
[14134.49s -> 14135.49s]  Again?
[14135.49s -> 14138.84s]  Yeah.
[14138.84s -> 14141.21s]  I don't want to use this.
[14141.21s -> 14142.21s]  I'm good.
[14142.21s -> 14145.88s]  Thanks.
[14145.88s -> 14146.88s]  I need more eggs.
[14146.88s -> 14180.66s]  I don't look so good.
[14180.66s -> 14188.49s]  Damn it.
[14188.49s -> 14212.77s]  I hate this.
[14212.77s -> 14218.62s]  Uh oh.
[14218.62s -> 14220.62s]  I guess this is their idea of a warm welcome.
[14220.62s -> 14232.10s]  I am shit faced right now.
[14233.27s -> 14276.73s]  Stop asking that.
[14276.73s -> 14287.25s]  God damn it.
[14287.25s -> 14288.25s]  I am going to heal.
[14288.25s -> 14294.52s]  I hate wasting materials.
[14294.52s -> 14296.52s]  I hate taking the materials.
[14296.52s -> 14299.68s]  It sucks.
[14299.68s -> 14331.75s]  Move.
[14331.75s -> 14336.53s]  I guess this is their idea of a warm welcome.
[14336.53s -> 14342.82s]  Alright, so we got...
[14342.82s -> 14344.82s]  I'm going to go this way.
[14344.82s -> 14346.70s]  Same.
[14346.70s -> 14352.40s]  You know, we're going this way actually.
[14352.40s -> 14353.40s]  I want to restart so bad.
[14353.40s -> 14354.40s]  You have no idea.
[14354.40s -> 14360.50s]  Shoot him.
[14360.50s -> 14365.52s]  She's going to get killed.
[14365.52s -> 14388.20s]  Back it up.
[14388.20s -> 14389.20s]  Do the stab.
[14389.20s -> 14413.10s]  Oh my God.
[14413.10s -> 14416.10s]  Did I shoot myself in the face?
[14416.10s -> 14445.63s]  I don't want to.
[14445.63s -> 14448.13s]  Alright, where's the last catapult?
[14448.13s -> 14457.30s]  Right there.
[14457.30s -> 14458.30s]  Duck.
[14458.30s -> 14507.29s]  I just want to fucking shoot it.
[14507.29s -> 14536.05s]  You okay?
[14536.05s -> 14537.05s]  Alright, we're good.
[14537.05s -> 14539.70s]  We're good.
[14539.70s -> 14540.70s]  Where are the last ones?
[14540.70s -> 14542.58s]  I got all the ones here.
[14542.58s -> 14549.77s]  Okay.
[14549.77s -> 14550.77s]  All the catapults are done.
[14550.77s -> 14551.77s]  Thank God.
[14551.77s -> 14553.65s]  I think.
[14553.65s -> 14554.65s]  No, there's one more.
[14554.65s -> 14564.12s]  Where can I hit it from?
[14564.12s -> 14578.61s]  Is she coming?
[14578.61s -> 14636.87s]  One more.
[14636.87s -> 14640.22s]  Nice.
[14640.22s -> 14649.72s]  Uh oh.
[14649.72s -> 14659.26s]  Why did you not come in the door?
[14659.26s -> 14691.97s]  Oh!
[14691.97s -> 14720.94s]  My sensitivity is so low on this thing.
[14720.94s -> 14725.38s]  Nice.
[14725.38s -> 14726.38s]  Alright.
[14726.38s -> 14727.38s]  I think I got everything.
[14727.38s -> 14729.38s]  There's one thing here.
[14729.38s -> 14734.16s]  Where is it?
[14734.16s -> 14735.16s]  Down below?
[14735.16s -> 14737.55s]  Did I miss it?
[14737.55s -> 14738.55s]  I can take a second though.
[14738.55s -> 14748.37s]  I can hear it.
[14748.37s -> 14756.14s]  Eh.
[14756.14s -> 14767.08s]  Where's this last blue medallion?
[14767.08s -> 14775.40s]  I got a pee so bad.
[14775.40s -> 14780.52s]  Do you have your cheater?
[14780.52s -> 14789.03s]  I mean I have to get it.
[14789.03s -> 14827.65s]  It's only one more.
[14827.65s -> 14874.78s]  I don't see it.
[14874.78s -> 14880.30s]  I don't see it.
[14880.30s -> 14882.30s]  There's also another treasure in here somewhere.
[14882.30s -> 14889.79s]  But where's this last blue medallion?
[14889.79s -> 14894.46s]  It'll show you when you get the blue request, really?
[14894.46s -> 14904.41s]  Really?
[14904.41s -> 14905.41s]  Alright.
[14905.41s -> 14906.41s]  Well the actual treasure is right there.
[14906.41s -> 14912.49s]  Can you not talk for 30 seconds on stream?
[14912.49s -> 14914.49s]  I feel like I do that pretty frequently.
[14914.49s -> 14953.81s]  Blue medallions.
[14953.81s -> 14959.08s]  God damn it.
[14959.08s -> 14960.08s]  You were right.
[14960.08s -> 14962.15s]  It actually does show up.
[14962.15s -> 14963.15s]  Where is it?
[14963.15s -> 14964.15s]  Where is that?
[14964.15s -> 14965.39s]  It's like all the way out.
[14965.39s -> 14982.82s]  It's like on the rocks.
[14982.82s -> 15003.01s]  Good.
[15003.01s -> 15011.16s]  There it is.
[15011.16s -> 15018.99s]  That's my favorite land mammal.
[15018.99s -> 15020.23s]  Buffalo.
[15020.23s -> 15023.52s]  Or a rhinoceros.
[15023.52s -> 15029.70s]  Rhinoceros is what an unbelievably ridiculous animal.
[15029.70s -> 15030.70s]  Rhinoceros is crazy.
[15030.70s -> 15040.07s]  What about humans?
[15040.07s -> 15043.25s]  Humans are definitely not as cool as a rhinoceros.
[15043.25s -> 15062.75s]  Give me my spinal.
[15072.75s -> 15075.46s]  Okay.
[15075.46s -> 15079.46s]  30 exclusive upgrade tickets?
[15080.70s -> 15082.70s]  Years haven't been kind to us.
[15082.70s -> 15087.70s]  A single use ticket that grants access to a weapon's exclusive upgrade, regardless of
[15087.70s -> 15088.70s]  the weapon's level.
[15088.70s -> 15089.70s]  These are 30.
[15089.70s -> 15095.85s]  I've been spending these the whole time.
[15095.85s -> 15096.85s]  Red herb drop rate.
[15096.85s -> 15105.62s]  Is this out of reach now?
[15105.62s -> 15112.02s]  This might actually be out of reach.
[15112.02s -> 15114.38s]  Do I have to save a lot?
[15123.37s -> 15126.98s]  Double blue?
[15126.98s -> 15142.06s]  Yeah, double blue.
[15147.06s -> 15155.42s]  Oh, I can buy these now.
[15159.42s -> 15164.38s]  Where's my...
[15168.38s -> 15170.38s]  Oh, I need to get it out of my box.
[15177.56s -> 15179.56s]  Alright, we're going damage.
[15184.68s -> 15185.68s]  Or ammo.
[15185.68s -> 15186.68s]  Damage.
[15186.68s -> 15188.94s]  Yeah.
[15192.57s -> 15205.45s]  Alright, I'm going to pee.
[15205.45s -> 15207.84s]  I'll be right back.
[15207.84s -> 15208.84s]  Give me two seconds.
[15208.84s -> 15210.34s]  Cinnamon.
[15210.34s -> 15510.90s]  Back.
[15510.90s -> 15512.21s]  And I got a snack.
[15512.21s -> 15528.87s]  It's a tortilla.
[15528.87s -> 15531.52s]  Fired.
[15531.52s -> 15534.21s]  Fired tortilla with hummus in it.
[15534.21s -> 15535.51s]  Just spreading it.
[15535.51s -> 15553.18s]  Simple.
[15553.18s -> 15554.18s]  You know what a really good snack is?
[15554.18s -> 15562.62s]  Who here has had matzo bread?
[15562.62s -> 15564.62s]  The really thin, cracker-like bread?
[15564.62s -> 15566.11s]  You ever have matzo bread?
[15566.11s -> 15574.38s]  So, matzo bread is usually...
[15574.38s -> 15576.38s]  I remember when I was younger.
[15576.38s -> 15580.05s]  My mother used to spread a little bit of butter on it.
[15580.05s -> 15585.13s]  It was just like, holy shit, this is phenomenal.
[15585.13s -> 15586.37s]  It's so good.
[15586.37s -> 15590.58s]  But I've been putting hummus on it.
[15590.58s -> 15593.75s]  I've been spreading hummus across it instead of butter.
[15593.75s -> 15601.34s]  Butter is delicious, but you can really go a little overboard
[15601.34s -> 15604.34s]  when you spread butter on matzo bread.
[15604.34s -> 15608.35s]  And you'll look at what you have, because matzo bread is big.
[15608.35s -> 15610.59s]  It's like a huge cracker.
[15610.59s -> 15615.02s]  So, putting butter across this gigantic square,
[15615.02s -> 15617.39s]  it kind of feels kind of bad.
[15617.39s -> 15622.45s]  So, I've been putting hummus on it, and it's unbelievable.
[15622.45s -> 15623.45s]  Unbelievable.
[15623.45s -> 15625.84s]  Highly recommended.
[15625.84s -> 15630.87s]  You can get matzo bread at pretty much any grocery store, too.
[15630.87s -> 15635.08s]  It's very dry, but it's very good.
[15635.08s -> 15642.63s]  I don't eat this weirdly, I promise.
[15642.63s -> 15643.63s]  I just want to eat it a little fast.
[15643.63s -> 15653.68s]  What about horseradish?
[15653.68s -> 15654.68s]  Hmm.
[15654.68s -> 15656.43s]  Good tip.
[15656.43s -> 15662.58s]  Is that the one that looks like crispy cardboard?
[15662.58s -> 15667.66s]  Yep.
[15667.66s -> 15668.66s]  It is very, very dry.
[15668.66s -> 15670.66s]  It's got a great flavor, though.
[15670.66s -> 15675.25s]  Matzo and butter, it gets dangerous.
[15675.25s -> 15676.25s]  Trust me.
[15676.25s -> 15687.66s]  Matzo ball soup.
[15687.66s -> 15695.34s]  If you've had matzo ball soup, it's phenomenal.
[15695.34s -> 15700.63s]  Just kind of super salty, super flavorful.
[15700.63s -> 15724.91s]  What about radishes?
[15724.91s -> 15725.91s]  Been a while, yeah.
[15725.91s -> 15736.09s]  Matzo ball soup is practically crack.
[15736.09s -> 15737.78s]  It is.
[15737.78s -> 15745.54s]  When you get those big matzo balls, and you just take your spoon,
[15745.54s -> 15748.91s]  you're just going to press down, and it just forms around the spoon.
[15748.91s -> 15749.91s]  You get a little bit of the broth.
[15749.91s -> 15756.35s]  If you've never had it before, I really suggest you try it.
[15756.35s -> 15758.10s]  Very, very good.
[15758.10s -> 15759.79s]  It's super basic, too.
[15759.79s -> 15763.27s]  It's very, I don't want to say plain, but it's very,
[15764.27s -> 15767.92s]  it's very palatable.
[15767.92s -> 15769.92s]  It's not really heavily spiced or really,
[15769.92s -> 15771.92s]  oh, what kind of flavor can I expect?
[15771.92s -> 15778.16s]  It's just a good broth, kind of salty, sort of the texture.
[15778.16s -> 15779.16s]  It's just very good.
[15779.16s -> 15788.31s]  It's very straightforward, yeah.
[15788.31s -> 15789.31s]  You making me want bread?
[15789.31s -> 15793.34s]  I could live off of matzo bread.
[15793.34s -> 15796.34s]  If you gave me just 10 cases of matzo bread,
[15796.34s -> 15801.34s]  and two pounds of butter, and three pounds of garlic hummus,
[15801.34s -> 15803.34s]  I would probably be happy for a month.
[15803.34s -> 15809.98s]  Or even, it might even be a week.
[15809.98s -> 15812.74s]  Oh, here he is.
[15822.93s -> 15824.93s]  Holy shit.
[15824.93s -> 15827.93s]  He looks crazy in this one.
[15846.98s -> 15852.73s]  Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kennedy.
[15852.73s -> 15855.76s]  Oh, no.
[15855.76s -> 15859.76s]  Nonetheless, you see, the girl must be ours.
[15859.76s -> 15863.76s]  With a girl as the very source, your United States,
[15863.76s -> 15867.76s]  and then the entire world shall overflow with his grace.
[15867.76s -> 15875.76s]  For that is the iron will of my master, the most holy, Lord Sadler.
[15875.76s -> 15881.26s]  So then you will comply, yes?
[15881.26s -> 15882.26s]  Never.
[15882.26s -> 15884.26s]  You heard the lady.
[15884.26s -> 15887.26s]  How unfortunate.
[15887.26s -> 15893.26s]  Do make sure our guest feels at home now that he has chosen death.
[15893.26s -> 15903.33s]  Leon.
[15903.33s -> 15905.33s]  Just stay close.
[15905.33s -> 15928.82s]  No way a shotgun blast would have blown your head off.
[15928.82s -> 15934.00s]  I thought it was Barry.
[15934.00s -> 15948.34s]  Leon.
[15948.34s -> 15949.34s]  Get cocky for a second.
[15949.34s -> 15957.65s]  True.
[15957.65s -> 15965.10s]  This doesn't fit.
[15965.10s -> 15983.00s]  Didn't I buy heel saving this one?
[15983.00s -> 15993.71s]  Could go up.
[15993.71s -> 15994.71s]  Wait, let me check the other side.
[15994.71s -> 16006.58s]  Of course it is.
[16006.58s -> 16007.58s]  Won't open.
[16007.58s -> 16019.63s]  Yes.
[16019.63s -> 16020.63s]  Perfect timing.
[16020.63s -> 16029.30s]  Right when you need it.
[16029.30s -> 16040.60s]  I don't think you can go in the front door, but I'm going to do it anyways.
[16040.60s -> 16041.60s]  Locked.
[16041.60s -> 16043.86s]  There's got to be another way to get to the...
[16043.86s -> 16050.93s]  Over here.
[16050.93s -> 16056.10s]  Okay.
[16056.10s -> 16059.62s]  I need you to open it from the other side.
[16059.62s -> 16062.78s]  Buck.
[16062.78s -> 16069.26s]  Okay.
[16069.26s -> 16070.76s]  Nice job.
[16070.76s -> 16071.76s]  Thanks.
[16071.76s -> 16089.83s]  More money.
[16089.83s -> 16107.57s]  Did she?
[16107.57s -> 16108.57s]  Did she follow through?
[16108.57s -> 16119.02s]  Yeah.
[16119.02s -> 16120.02s]  Can I actually knock it through this?
[16120.02s -> 16122.10s]  What can I say?
[16122.10s -> 16136.46s]  Let's continue.
[16136.46s -> 16144.18s]  Looks like we can continue on this way.
[16144.18s -> 16146.18s]  This dude doesn't wash his dishes.
[16146.18s -> 16147.18s]  I didn't have a dish.
[16147.18s -> 16150.50s]  I had a little paper towel.
[16150.50s -> 16156.45s]  Little napkin.
[16156.45s -> 16161.08s]  God.
[16161.08s -> 16162.08s]  None shall escape.
[16162.08s -> 16185.65s]  Sounds of nails clawing at the stone walls and the writhing moan of curses.
[16185.65s -> 16188.95s]  That man harbors enough hate to ruin this world.
[16188.95s -> 16192.95s]  He once served the lord of the castle as the torturer, like his father and grandfather
[16192.95s -> 16193.95s]  before him.
[16193.95s -> 16197.95s]  One of the many unsightly legacies left by Salazar family.
[16197.95s -> 16201.15s]  Even among his family he was special.
[16201.15s -> 16204.15s]  He enjoyed his work wholeheartedly and had a talent for it.
[16204.15s -> 16206.15s]  He was gifted at tormenting others.
[16206.15s -> 16208.15s]  His abilities soon attracted the master's interest.
[16208.15s -> 16210.52s]  And when he took him to the dungeon...
[16210.52s -> 16211.52s]  No.
[16211.52s -> 16212.52s]  I can't write anymore.
[16212.52s -> 16213.52s]  I won't.
[16213.52s -> 16215.52s]  I don't want to recall what happened down there.
[16215.52s -> 16217.52s]  My mind can't take it.
[16217.52s -> 16218.76s]  It'll break me.
[16218.76s -> 16222.76s]  I was ordered to attend to him, to feed him, dispose of the filth, all while listening
[16222.76s -> 16224.76s]  to that wretched voice every night.
[16224.76s -> 16226.00s]  I can't take it anymore.
[16226.00s -> 16227.00s]  I've had enough.
[16227.00s -> 16230.00s]  I will not tolerate one more night in this castle.
[16230.00s -> 16235.24s]  I shall leave tomorrow, go far away, where that voice cannot reach my ears.
[16235.24s -> 16271.60s]  That's no way to go.
[16271.60s -> 16276.25s]  Do they keep animals down here or something?
[16276.25s -> 16278.77s]  Quick!
[16278.77s -> 16279.77s]  Ashley, hide!
[16279.77s -> 16280.94s]  Okay.
[16280.94s -> 16312.11s]  Can I light these?
[16312.11s -> 16327.30s]  All right.
[16327.30s -> 16328.30s]  I'm not going to stall anymore.
[16328.30s -> 16337.99s]  Let's go.
[16337.99s -> 16338.99s]  I do remember this part.
[16338.99s -> 16357.90s]  The light is lost.
[16358.90s -> 16365.94s]  Apparently, I don't remember this part.
[16365.94s -> 16382.30s]  I remember this part.
[16382.30s -> 16383.30s]  These guys are awful.
[16383.30s -> 16385.30s]  I forgot about this enemy.
[16385.30s -> 16386.30s]  Okay.
[16387.30s -> 16388.30s]  I forget.
[16388.30s -> 16390.30s]  I know you have to bait them.
[16500.61s -> 16503.83s]  Oh, shit.
[16503.83s -> 16521.20s]  Oh, shit.
[16521.20s -> 16525.87s]  Oh, those guys are so bad.
[16525.87s -> 16531.11s]  I distinctly have a memory of a part of this game in a little bit, maybe like an hour or so.
[16531.11s -> 16535.19s]  It's one of the worst parts of the whole game.
[16535.19s -> 16536.19s]  It's so scary and it's so awful.
[16536.19s -> 16538.19s]  And it's including those guys.
[16538.19s -> 16543.57s]  That is not the enemy I was talking about.
[16543.57s -> 16545.87s]  There's another one after that that I find to be worse.
[16545.87s -> 16549.46s]  But these guys are pretty bad.
[16549.46s -> 16553.49s]  You all know the ones I'm talking about.
[16553.49s -> 16556.43s]  I'll give you a quick hint.
[16556.43s -> 16576.42s]  You'll see.
[16576.42s -> 16577.42s]  Eventually.
[16577.42s -> 16589.52s]  Where's Ashley?
[16589.52s -> 16610.09s]  You okay?
[16610.09s -> 16613.38s]  It's you.
[16613.38s -> 16615.83s]  What happened down there?
[16615.83s -> 16617.58s]  Nothing.
[16617.58s -> 16619.14s]  You were right about the animals, though.
[16619.14s -> 16620.14s]  Nothing.
[16620.14s -> 16624.24s]  A little bit more than nothing happened down there.
[16624.24s -> 16637.53s]  You get a lot of headaches because you squint a lot.
[16637.53s -> 16639.70s]  Probably.
[16639.70s -> 16640.70s]  You okay?
[16640.70s -> 16647.90s]  I'm fine.
[16647.90s -> 16649.39s]  Come on.
[16649.39s -> 16650.82s]  For now.
[16650.82s -> 16668.13s]  All those bobbleheads are here or whatever they are.
[16668.13s -> 16669.13s]  Good.
[16669.13s -> 16680.22s]  There you are.
[16680.22s -> 16682.23s]  I thought I shot her in the head.
[16682.23s -> 16687.67s]  How are we doing on crafting here?
[16687.67s -> 16688.67s]  All right.
[16688.67s -> 16692.34s]  Let's see.
[16692.34s -> 16693.34s]  So I get 15 percent.
[16693.34s -> 16694.78s]  20.
[16694.78s -> 16695.78s]  So there's a 35 percent chance.
[16695.78s -> 16701.98s]  Does that mean there's a 35 percent chance to get more or I get 35 percent more for doing
[16701.98s -> 16702.98s]  this?
[16702.98s -> 16706.14s]  I think it's chance.
[16706.14s -> 16707.14s]  Unfortunate.
[16708.31s -> 16728.23s]  I actually need to start making shotgun bullets because it's one of the best items I have right
[16728.23s -> 16729.23s]  now.
[16729.23s -> 16730.23s]  You know what?
[16730.23s -> 16731.23s]  Use this.
[16731.23s -> 16735.74s]  I had it in my inventory for two hours and I haven't even used it.
[16735.74s -> 16737.02s]  There is a treasure here.
[16737.02s -> 16738.46s]  Where is it?
[16738.46s -> 16780.88s]  It seems almost fully upgraded, too.
[16780.88s -> 16784.64s]  I need the eagle, the snake, and the moose.
[16784.64s -> 16802.31s]  Okay.
[16802.31s -> 16846.64s]  I don't even think about it.
[16846.64s -> 16847.64s]  Bloodied sword.
[16847.64s -> 16850.80s]  Well, it's just a replica.
[16850.80s -> 16861.83s]  Only a couple of uses for it.
[16861.83s -> 16863.52s]  Okay.
[16863.52s -> 16867.38s]  Iron sword.
[16867.38s -> 16876.27s]  So, um, a superb golden sword that has been dulled for display and cannot be used as a
[16876.27s -> 16884.98s]  weapon.
[16884.98s -> 16885.98s]  Gold?
[16885.98s -> 16893.43s]  Maybe this is gold?
[16893.43s -> 16900.58s]  That once was a knight who was very strong-willed.
[16900.58s -> 16908.33s]  The king knighted him, giving him the ability to go fight for the kingdom.
[16908.33s -> 16913.14s]  He did so very valiantly, but he died.
[16938.58s -> 16939.58s]  And his sword became rusty.
[16939.58s -> 16940.58s]  The end.
[16940.58s -> 16991.10s]  I'm going to start using the knife more, but I'm afraid of breaking it.
[16991.10s -> 16992.10s]  Okay.
[16992.10s -> 16993.27s]  This is...
[17004.10s -> 17005.10s]  All right.
[17005.10s -> 17007.74s]  What is this one?
[17007.74s -> 17008.74s]  This one is seahorse snake.
[17008.74s -> 17012.35s]  What is a snake?
[17012.35s -> 17031.06s]  Put that down.
[17048.26s -> 17051.93s]  Ooh.
[17051.93s -> 17057.58s]  Nice.
[17057.58s -> 17063.50s]  Golden hourglass.
[17063.50s -> 17064.50s]  As if.
[17071.92s -> 17084.51s]  I'm going to do it again.
[17084.51s -> 17090.81s]  All right.
[17090.81s -> 17097.13s]  There's the snake.
[17097.13s -> 17104.32s]  Ooh.
[17104.32s -> 17105.32s]  Look at...
[17105.32s -> 17106.32s]  Yo, look at that.
[17106.32s -> 17107.32s]  That was very helpful.
[17107.32s -> 17110.39s]  That was exceptionally helpful.
[17110.39s -> 17114.00s]  Wow.
[17114.00s -> 17115.00s]  There's items, though.
[17115.00s -> 17121.27s]  I think there's items over here, probably.
[17121.27s -> 17127.18s]  No items?
[17127.18s -> 17152.55s]  Yeah, there is.
[17152.55s -> 17154.82s]  From the school announcements.
[17164.81s -> 17165.81s]  Oh.
[17165.81s -> 17187.66s]  Can't pick up that golden chalice.
[17187.66s -> 17200.17s]  Give ourselves the way back.
[17200.17s -> 17212.61s]  All right.
[17212.61s -> 17213.61s]  Hey, a safe haven.
[17213.61s -> 17222.85s]  Good.
[17222.85s -> 17224.85s]  There are some parasites that have the ability to control their hosts.
[17224.85s -> 17229.53s]  This is basic knowledge among most biologists, but not much is known as to how the parasites
[17229.53s -> 17230.96s]  do it.
[17230.96s -> 17235.57s]  The following is a list of several such parasites.
[17235.57s -> 17243.72s]  Weird.
[17243.72s -> 17247.41s]  Actually, this is pretty interesting.
[17271.95s -> 17274.70s]  The galactosomum.
[17278.70s -> 17280.70s]  And the parrot bass.
[17307.42s -> 17328.91s]  That's why I eat a lot of garlic.
[17328.91s -> 17329.91s]  Those things are nasty.
[17329.91s -> 17331.47s]  Yeah.
[17331.47s -> 17344.94s]  I could make...
[17344.94s -> 17356.29s]  Let's do this.
[17356.29s -> 17357.29s]  There's two ways to go here.
[17357.29s -> 17358.29s]  Is this a dead end?
[17358.29s -> 17364.84s]  It is.
[17364.84s -> 17365.84s]  No good.
[17365.84s -> 17368.17s]  Isn't there...
[17368.17s -> 17371.17s]  There's, like, a minigame or something here, isn't there?
[17371.17s -> 17374.66s]  Why do I have a weird memory of it being a minigame here?
[17374.66s -> 17381.66s]  There is.
[17381.66s -> 17382.66s]  It is a shooting range.
[17382.66s -> 17383.66s]  Okay.
[17383.66s -> 17396.87s]  Be careful.
[17396.87s -> 17399.07s]  Nice shot.
[17399.07s -> 17400.07s]  Ashley's very nice.
[17400.07s -> 17401.38s]  Very helpful.
[17401.38s -> 17423.54s]  Am I facing him too big?
[17423.54s -> 17430.46s]  We are.
[17430.46s -> 17432.46s]  Tonight's entertainment.
[17432.46s -> 17434.54s]  Where's Harvey?
[17434.54s -> 17435.54s]  Dan, you know?
[17435.54s -> 17436.54s]  Have you seen him?
[17436.54s -> 17448.90s]  You know?
[17448.90s -> 17449.90s]  Oh my goodness.
[17449.90s -> 17475.39s]  I don't even have the thing pop out.
[17475.39s -> 17476.76s]  Ah!
[17476.76s -> 17477.76s]  Oh my goodness.
[17477.76s -> 17479.45s]  I missed.
[17479.45s -> 17485.40s]  I'm not getting those.
[17485.40s -> 17488.05s]  All right.
[17488.05s -> 17489.05s]  We need to...
[17489.05s -> 17494.62s]  We need to actually get over here.
[17494.62s -> 17517.55s]  All right.
[17517.55s -> 17518.55s]  Not bad.
[17518.55s -> 17544.56s]  We're okay.
[17544.56s -> 17617.48s]  I'm fine.
[17617.48s -> 17618.48s]  Ooh, good.
[17618.48s -> 17637.13s]  Boy, hey.
[17650.34s -> 17667.77s]  I'm fine.
[17667.77s -> 17671.06s]  Ooh, good.
[17671.06s -> 17689.51s]  Boy, hey.
[17689.51s -> 17690.51s]  Some of us are trying to sleep.
[17690.51s -> 17694.51s]  This is the probably worst game to be watching when you're falling asleep.
[17694.51s -> 17695.51s]  You're going to have nightmares.
[17695.51s -> 17710.58s]  All right.
[17710.58s -> 17712.58s]  I got to get the wheel, which is over there.
[17712.58s -> 17730.06s]  Yeah, over there.
[17730.06s -> 17740.51s]  Fell asleep watching the VOD yesterday.
[17740.51s -> 17742.51s]  I guess it's all about volume, isn't it?
[17742.51s -> 17743.51s]  You turn the volume down.
[17743.51s -> 17780.85s]  Why would you say that?
[17780.85s -> 17781.85s]  There's nobody even near us.
[17781.85s -> 17798.83s]  Come on.
[17798.83s -> 17799.83s]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[17799.83s -> 17805.62s]  Whoa.
[17805.62s -> 17806.98s]  What happened to her?
[17806.98s -> 17807.98s]  Oh.
[17807.98s -> 17809.48s]  Duck.
[17812.06s -> 17817.40s]  Duck.
[17817.40s -> 17818.40s]  Shit.
[17818.40s -> 17863.29s]  Where's eight?
[17863.29s -> 17867.81s]  Why can't Leon just give her a gun or at least a brick?
[17867.81s -> 17874.74s]  You wouldn't believe what you could do with a brick.
[17874.74s -> 17884.20s]  Let me just collect the items.
[17884.20s -> 17892.19s]  Honestly, if somebody threw a brick and it hit you right in that face, I think that's
[17892.19s -> 17895.43s]  as bad as getting shot, right?
[17895.43s -> 17898.43s]  I mean, that would probably just kill you.
[17898.43s -> 17905.98s]  You can be a backpack with a bunch of bricks, and I think we'd be all right in here.
[17905.98s -> 17906.98s]  Why am I going down?
[17906.98s -> 17907.98s]  I'm just looking at chat and talking.
[17907.98s -> 17908.98s]  Go up.
[17908.98s -> 17914.00s]  I can't reach that.
[17914.00s -> 17923.58s]  You need a backpack full of bricks.
[17923.58s -> 17926.22s]  Okay.
[17926.22s -> 17929.22s]  And the front compartment is like six bricks.
[17929.22s -> 17933.22s]  And in the side compartment of four, you know, the other compartment of the backpack of four
[17933.22s -> 17939.13s]  bologna and cheese sandwiches wrapped in saran wrap.
[17939.13s -> 17940.13s]  And a crowbar.
[17940.13s -> 17942.30s]  And put a crowbar on my belt.
[17942.30s -> 17943.30s]  I'm making it out of there.
[17943.30s -> 17950.14s]  Where did the...
[17950.14s -> 17954.46s]  I shot four arrows at somebody up here.
[17954.46s -> 17955.46s]  Where are they?
[17955.46s -> 17966.43s]  All the way up.
[17966.43s -> 17984.93s]  Don't underestimate the brick.
[17984.93s -> 17999.46s]  I think they're up here.
[17999.46s -> 18017.78s]  Let's do it.
[18017.78s -> 18031.86s]  A little over the top, don't you think?
[18031.86s -> 18041.81s]  Hmm.
[18041.81s -> 18045.48s]  Oh, right.
[18045.48s -> 18046.48s]  This part.
[18046.48s -> 18050.86s]  Got it.
[18050.86s -> 18052.86s]  This is why you have a rifle for this part, bud.
[18052.86s -> 18053.86s]  Are you going to be okay?
[18053.86s -> 18054.86s]  I'll be all right.
[18054.86s -> 18062.05s]  Yeah.
[18062.05s -> 18063.05s]  I'll cover you.
[18063.05s -> 18106.02s]  Don't stop.
[18106.02s -> 18120.57s]  Oh, fuck.
[18120.57s -> 18132.05s]  That guy sucks.
[18132.05s -> 18140.24s]  Oh, my God.
[18140.24s -> 18145.38s]  I'm sorry.
[18145.38s -> 18174.66s]  Nice job.
[18174.66s -> 18175.66s]  Okay.
[18175.66s -> 18178.50s]  Get back here.
[18178.50s -> 18179.50s]  I want to go through and collect everything.
[18179.50s -> 18180.50s]  Can I get up there?
[18180.50s -> 18181.50s]  Can I get up there?
[18181.50s -> 18191.27s]  I want to get up there.
[18191.27s -> 18193.27s]  Can you help me up there?
[18193.27s -> 18199.74s]  You okay?
[18199.74s -> 18200.74s]  I want to get up there.
[18200.74s -> 18204.16s]  Shit.
[18204.16s -> 18205.40s]  Oh, well.
[18205.40s -> 18206.40s]  There's no drops.
[18206.40s -> 18211.48s]  It's all good.
[18211.48s -> 18223.71s]  Come on.
[18223.71s -> 18227.90s]  That was intense.
[18227.90s -> 18228.90s]  You threw a grenade at her.
[18228.90s -> 18232.48s]  I had to make a choice.
[18232.48s -> 18239.72s]  It was either she dies because four people were attacking her, or I do about 70 percent
[18239.72s -> 18242.72s]  of her health in a grenade and everybody dies around her.
[18242.72s -> 18257.50s]  I had to make a choice.
[18257.50s -> 18258.50s]  You got 30k.
[18258.50s -> 18277.02s]  Give her one.
[18277.02s -> 18278.02s]  Give her some bricks.
[18278.02s -> 18280.67s]  That's what I'm saying.
[18280.67s -> 18285.86s]  I think that's all I can do.
[18285.86s -> 18289.61s]  I need to throw you up here.
[18289.61s -> 18290.91s]  Come on.
[18290.91s -> 18302.01s]  Okay.
[18302.01s -> 18303.76s]  Nice.
[18303.76s -> 18305.76s]  How far can you throw a rock?
[18305.76s -> 18306.76s]  Probably really far.
[18306.76s -> 18309.58s]  I would be like hop, hop, hop, run.
[18309.58s -> 18310.58s]  You have to be.
[18310.58s -> 18311.58s]  I would be in a full sprint.
[18311.58s -> 18312.58s]  How much?
[18312.58s -> 18314.58s]  How far can I sprint before I do it?
[18314.58s -> 18317.14s]  How many steps can I take?
[18317.14s -> 18325.87s]  Are we talking standing still from here, no pivoting, just kind of throw, or do we mean
[18326.87s -> 18329.87s]  one, two, three, four, five.
[18329.87s -> 18330.87s]  Gun it.
[18330.87s -> 18337.94s]  Because with like a power walk into a triple quadruple crow hop, I could probably throw
[18337.94s -> 18365.59s]  it a hundred yards.
[18365.59s -> 18368.73s]  Looks like the right place.
[18368.73s -> 18369.73s]  You okay?
[18369.73s -> 18371.67s]  I think so.
[18371.67s -> 18381.01s]  Instead of worrying about her, worry about your own skin.
[18381.01s -> 18418.21s]  Can you at least kick the knife back over here?
[18418.21s -> 18421.21s]  Like the knife is pretty much needed.
[18421.21s -> 18431.64s]  Drop the accuracy a little bit.
[18431.64s -> 18448.62s]  Thank God you didn't have it.
[18448.62s -> 18451.62s]  Yeah, if there was a brick in that scenario, Leona's dead.
[18451.62s -> 18453.06s]  Roost, come in.
[18453.06s -> 18454.06s]  Things went to shit.
[18454.06s -> 18459.23s]  We took refuge inside a castle, but I've just been separated from Baby Eagle.
[18459.23s -> 18460.23s]  Say it.
[18460.23s -> 18461.23s]  And you.
[18461.23s -> 18462.23s]  Roost, you're breaking up.
[18462.23s -> 18463.23s]  Do you read me?
[18463.23s -> 18464.23s]  Damn it.
[18464.23s -> 18466.30s]  So much for that.
[18466.30s -> 18471.32s]  All right.
[18471.32s -> 18472.32s]  Get all that.
[18472.32s -> 18479.19s]  So much over there.
[18479.19s -> 18483.18s]  All right.
[18483.18s -> 18484.18s]  Find Ashley.
[18484.18s -> 18485.18s]  I do have a lot of stuff to sell.
[18485.18s -> 18487.32s]  Having a rough day, stranger.
[18487.32s -> 18488.32s]  Got something new for you.
[18488.32s -> 18489.32s]  Body armor.
[18489.32s -> 18498.18s]  Bang for your buck.
[18498.18s -> 18502.81s]  I guarantee it.
[18502.81s -> 18503.81s]  Yeah, I don't need it.
[18503.81s -> 18504.81s]  Ruby's all rubbish.
[18504.81s -> 18508.74s]  It makes no difference.
[18508.74s -> 18515.75s]  These don't have any slots, do they?
[18515.75s -> 18522.55s]  Hold on, wait a minute.
[18522.55s -> 18523.55s]  Now.
[18523.55s -> 18531.19s]  Be yourself, stranger.
[18531.19s -> 18532.19s]  Welcome.
[18532.19s -> 18535.19s]  You're valuables, stranger.
[18535.19s -> 18536.19s]  70k.
[18536.19s -> 18548.57s]  I'll pay a pretty penny for that.
[18548.57s -> 18558.39s]  Your weapons are in good hands, mate.
[18558.39s -> 18559.87s]  I'll see you right.
[18559.87s -> 18566.67s]  Finish the knife.
[18566.67s -> 18569.83s]  Your weapons are in good hands, mate.
[18569.83s -> 18572.53s]  I'll see you right.
[18572.53s -> 18577.87s]  Finish the knife?
[18577.87s -> 18580.11s]  Will that be pleasant travels?
[18580.11s -> 18590.20s]  What is that there?
[18590.20s -> 18593.12s]  Got a lot of shit in here.
[18593.12s -> 18594.20s]  Sell the rifle ammo.
[18596.04s -> 18602.16s]  Welcome.
[18602.16s -> 18605.51s]  I'll buy it for thank you.
[18605.51s -> 18608.68s]  Yeah.
[18608.68s -> 18609.52s]  Come back.
[18609.52s -> 18615.04s]  I got a lot of crap.
[18615.04s -> 18616.76s]  I'm gonna sell.
[18616.76s -> 18619.95s]  Any time.
[18619.95s -> 18628.10s]  All right, give me extra magnum ammo.
[18628.10s -> 18653.01s]  You're killing me.
[18653.01s -> 18660.50s]  All right, let me get it out of there.
[18660.52s -> 18661.80s]  Welcome.
[18661.80s -> 18665.64s]  Ooh, what you buying?
[18665.64s -> 18667.28s]  Dazzled, are you?
[18668.36s -> 18671.72s]  Our craftsmanship demands no less.
[18671.72s -> 18680.20s]  This thing is ready to go now.
[18680.20s -> 18683.28s]  21 damage, eight shots.
[18683.28s -> 18687.91s]  Molding a weapon to suit your specific needs.
[18687.91s -> 18696.75s]  Honestly, I don't think I care about either one of these.
[18696.75s -> 18700.87s]  Got a selection of good things on sale, stranger.
[18702.24s -> 18703.08s]  Pleasant travels.
[18703.08s -> 18704.04s]  That'd be fine.
[18704.04s -> 18706.85s]  Okay.
[18706.85s -> 18713.69s]  So how many shots do I have with this?
[18713.69s -> 18720.52s]  Six, what do you mean six?
[18720.52s -> 18722.04s]  What do you mean six?
[18722.04s -> 18729.19s]  This shouldn't just have eight?
[18729.19s -> 18736.40s]  What do you mean six?
[18736.40s -> 18738.96s]  I thought that if you upgraded the ammo capacity,
[18738.96s -> 18747.32s]  it went up to the maximum.
[18747.32s -> 18750.58s]  No?
[18750.58s -> 18752.14s]  Does that happen in the other games?
[18752.14s -> 18753.54s]  That's in the original.
[18753.54s -> 18754.82s]  It has eight.
[18754.82s -> 18756.54s]  Yeah, but I mean, I thought that when you upgrade
[18756.54s -> 18758.22s]  ammo capacity, it fills it up.
[18761.16s -> 18767.27s]  That's all right.
[18767.27s -> 18769.59s]  I feel pretty good about this.
[18769.59s -> 18791.21s]  I'm gonna go.
[18791.21s -> 18807.09s]  Ooh, Magnam ammo, nice.
[18807.09s -> 18811.68s]  There's people alive.
[18811.68s -> 18816.54s]  This is messed up.
[18816.54s -> 18817.74s]  There are other revolvers in the game
[18817.74s -> 18822.24s]  that are better than this one.
[18822.24s -> 18825.31s]  That's all right.
[18825.31s -> 18827.63s]  You get all your money back when you sell something.
[18827.63s -> 18862.61s]  So that's fine.
[18862.61s -> 18864.41s]  The voice of Pestilence dwells in the flames,
[18864.41s -> 18866.01s]  leading the pitiful souls to salvation.
[18866.01s -> 18869.33s]  Consign the crimson flame to its rightful place,
[18869.33s -> 18885.44s]  where you shall be enlightened.
[18885.44s -> 18893.15s]  Lord, I'm doing this.
[18894.71s -> 18899.12s]  Ready to interrupt.
[18899.12s -> 18899.96s]  Uh-huh.
[18899.96s -> 18916.45s]  Buzzo.
[18916.45s -> 18922.32s]  Get away from me.
[18922.32s -> 18923.16s]  Stop reloading.
[18923.16s -> 18924.64s]  Out of you, out of your mind.
[18934.39s -> 18937.69s]  Stop doing this.
[18937.69s -> 18938.53s]  Oh, shit.
[18951.69s -> 18958.45s]  Get off of me.
[18958.45s -> 18970.71s]  Where is he?
[18970.71s -> 18986.04s]  Get over here.
[18986.04s -> 18988.66s]  Where is he?
[18988.66s -> 19006.33s]  Where is he?
[19006.33s -> 19021.62s]  No, I didn't want to do that.
[19021.62s -> 19040.72s]  Oh, shit.
[19040.72s -> 19042.00s]  All right.
[19042.00s -> 19053.38s]  There's a lot of stuff on the ground.
[19053.38s -> 19056.88s]  A Sephiroth's theme?
[19056.88s -> 19062.19s]  All right.
[19062.19s -> 19063.63s]  Wait, you mean the one that goes,
[19063.63s -> 19069.19s]  De-tee, de-tee-roo, de-tee-ree, de-tee-roo, de-tee-roo.
[19071.05s -> 19077.57s]  That one?
[19077.57s -> 19093.69s]  Hmm.
[19093.69s -> 19095.44s]  You're with pearls and rubies.
[19095.44s -> 19099.91s]  Nice.
[19099.91s -> 19102.24s]  Crimson Lantern.
[19102.24s -> 19105.34s]  That, it, there's probably something else in here.
[19105.34s -> 19113.12s]  There is.
[19113.12s -> 19142.38s]  Bullets on the ground and money.
[19142.38s -> 19146.44s]  Drop the chandelier.
[19146.44s -> 19147.28s]  Is that a good thing?
[19147.28s -> 19162.67s]  Should I do that?
[19162.67s -> 19174.56s]  How do I do it?
[19174.56s -> 19175.38s]  Oh, that's right.
[19175.38s -> 19176.22s]  There was that lever.
[19176.22s -> 19180.26s]  I ran by it because I fell off.
[19180.26s -> 19183.46s]  You fell off L ratio.
[19183.46s -> 19184.94s]  I said it before you did, so.
[19184.94s -> 19186.77s]  I made it so it's not funny.
[19186.77s -> 19187.93s]  Because if I say it and then you,
[19188.09s -> 19189.81s]  if I say it first, it's like, oh, fuck.
[19189.81s -> 19208.12s]  Like dad said it.
[19208.12s -> 19210.98s]  Ooh, that was worth it.
[19210.98s -> 19243.31s]  Appreciate it.
[19243.31s -> 19244.35s]  Need to Ashley.
[19244.35s -> 19247.47s]  Won't open.
[19247.47s -> 19248.74s]  Hmm.
[19248.74s -> 19249.58s]  There's a big chest in there.
[19249.58s -> 19265.89s]  Are there still snakes in boxes?
[19265.89s -> 19270.08s]  Yes, there is.
[19270.08s -> 19271.68s]  I actually just ate one.
[19271.68s -> 19283.75s]  Not that long ago.
[19283.75s -> 19288.38s]  Running low on juice here.
[19288.38s -> 19290.92s]  I need some more water.
[19290.92s -> 19298.33s]  You can stop.
[19298.33s -> 19302.80s]  Wouldn't make me use this, would you?
[19302.80s -> 19305.24s]  Well, after six years, that is one hell of a game.
[19305.24s -> 19306.92s]  I think that gun could go off.
[19306.92s -> 19308.54s]  Ada.
[19308.54s -> 19311.54s]  You don't seem surprised.
[19311.54s -> 19312.46s]  Interesting.
[19319.70s -> 19321.94s]  Try using knives next time.
[19321.94s -> 19324.74s]  Better for close encounters.
[19324.74s -> 19327.06s]  Not a bad move.
[19327.06s -> 19328.98s]  Very smooth.
[19328.98s -> 19331.34s]  So who are you working for this time?
[19331.34s -> 19333.44s]  Oh, Leon.
[19333.44s -> 19341.46s]  You know I don't work in town.
[19341.46s -> 19344.10s]  I thought he just stabbed himself in the chest.
[19344.10s -> 19347.66s]  She's lost no matter what.
[19347.66s -> 19350.98s]  You walk away now and who knows.
[19350.98s -> 19353.58s]  Maybe I'll live to meet me again.
[19353.58s -> 19357.11s]  And then I might get you that greeting you were looking for.
[19357.11s -> 19363.45s]  You think I'm gonna give up that easy?
[19366.60s -> 19367.44s]  Right.
[19367.44s -> 19371.76s]  How about we continue this discussion another time?
[19371.76s -> 19375.16s]  By the way, Wesker wears the sunglasses, you fucking dork.
[19377.76s -> 19384.76s]  Zip line out.
[19384.76s -> 19391.95s]  Last person I thought I'd run to here.
[19391.95s -> 19392.95s]  The glasses and the cut scene.
[19392.95s -> 19399.66s]  Yeah, they really are just ruining everything.
[19399.66s -> 19400.50s]  All right.
[19400.50s -> 19402.50s]  This is the maze part, isn't it?
[19405.18s -> 19458.64s]  My name is Maze.
[19458.64s -> 19472.66s]  I think I'm, am I missing one?
[19472.66s -> 19473.86s]  Oh wait, you can flip them.
[19473.86s -> 19483.84s]  Oops.
[19483.84s -> 19509.28s]  This is not correct.
[19509.28s -> 19510.44s]  It's not even a puzzle.
[19513.12s -> 19515.92s]  What is going on here?
[19515.92s -> 19517.28s]  Oh, it wants me to do, okay.
[19517.28s -> 19518.12s]  It wants me to do that.
[19518.12s -> 19554.39s]  Is that not right?
[19554.39s -> 19557.45s]  Bro.
[19557.45s -> 19558.85s]  Oh, it's a hexagon.
[19558.85s -> 19590.03s]  Should do it.
[19590.03s -> 19591.75s]  I guarantee I can run faster than you.
[19591.75s -> 19593.14s]  I guarantee it.
[19593.14s -> 19595.85s]  I guarantee it.
[19595.85s -> 19597.93s]  Can't, yeah, imagine we, all of us,
[19597.93s -> 19599.61s]  all fucking 13,000 of us,
[19599.61s -> 19601.92s]  we're at like a fucking 100 meter dash
[19601.92s -> 19603.96s]  and I'm, so here we go.
[19603.96s -> 19605.04s]  Start.
[19605.04s -> 19606.72s]  I blow by all of you.
[19606.72s -> 19609.33s]  And I'm gonna be looking back.
[19609.33s -> 19611.67s]  I'm gonna be, you're all gonna be in the review.
[19611.67s -> 19614.47s]  Some of you are gonna be like, I can't, I can't do it.
[19614.47s -> 19618.15s]  And I'm already finished.
[19618.95s -> 19622.01s]  Enjoy your puzzles.
[19622.01s -> 19623.03s]  All right.
[19623.03s -> 19635.76s]  Need to find Ashley.
[19635.76s -> 19637.68s]  Hear the signal echo through the mountains.
[19637.68s -> 19646.39s]  Rocks become gravel and the castle walls crumple.
[19646.39s -> 19649.07s]  You're 37 and you only eat raw radishes and mayonnaise.
[19649.07s -> 19650.27s]  That's not my diet, man.
[19650.27s -> 19651.59s]  I eat fucking chicken.
[19651.59s -> 19657.45s]  I eat lean turkey, spinach, lettuce, kale, hummus,
[19657.49s -> 19671.39s]  chickpeas, fruits, apples, carrots.
[19671.39s -> 19676.54s]  I've started eating an apple pretty much every day.
[19676.54s -> 19677.90s]  They're gonna be sprinting in the 100 meter dash.
[19677.90s -> 19679.02s]  I'm gonna be so far ahead of you.
[19679.02s -> 19681.18s]  And I'm just gonna take an apple out and just be like,
[19683.72s -> 19690.64s]  and just fucking just keep running.
[19690.64s -> 19693.20s]  Yeah, I might even throw a few banana peels behind me too.
[19693.20s -> 19705.15s]  Good luck.
[19705.15s -> 19705.99s]  What the hell?
[19705.99s -> 19739.02s]  I didn't even see what it was.
[19739.02s -> 19739.86s]  Christ.
[19742.92s -> 19745.00s]  Jesus.
[19745.00s -> 19747.64s]  Oh my God, he killed me.
[19747.64s -> 19748.48s]  Holy shit.
[19748.48s -> 19752.44s]  This is a new enemy.
[19752.44s -> 19756.28s]  This enemy was not in the other game.
[19756.28s -> 19760.61s]  Wow.
[19760.61s -> 19761.45s]  That's new.
[19761.45s -> 19762.27s]  Was it?
[19762.27s -> 19765.72s]  It was?
[19765.72s -> 19768.32s]  I don't remember.
[19768.32s -> 19769.44s]  He ran faster than you.
[19769.44s -> 19774.08s]  This is me hitting W-A-S-D on a keyboard.
[19774.08s -> 19796.03s]  Wait, there's an item in here.
[19796.03s -> 19812.58s]  Christ.
[19813.42s -> 19821.22s]  That was scary.
[19821.22s -> 19822.82s]  My legs are twice the length as yours.
[19822.82s -> 19825.82s]  That's fine.
[19825.82s -> 19827.82s]  You don't think I'm aware that a lot of you
[19827.82s -> 19829.06s]  might be taller than me?
[19829.06s -> 19833.52s]  Some of you might be shorter too.
[19833.52s -> 19837.64s]  You better, but I'm eating a whole bowl of pasta for that.
[19837.64s -> 19840.16s]  I'm gonna eat a full bowl of plain pasta.
[19840.16s -> 19843.92s]  Like two hours, four hours before we do our fucking
[19843.92s -> 19854.96s]  residential fitness test.
[19854.96s -> 19856.20s]  Welcome.
[19856.20s -> 19858.24s]  Ooh, what you're buying.
[19862.27s -> 19864.31s]  A deal well struck.
[19864.99s -> 19867.52s]  Ah.
[19867.52s -> 19869.84s]  I wanna go back to that game, the coin thing.
[19879.60s -> 19898.87s]  We're half your age, most of us too.
[19898.87s -> 19900.15s]  We'll see.
[19900.15s -> 19903.58s]  Why am I acting like we're doing this?
[19903.58s -> 19908.27s]  See you at the next meet, bro.
[19908.27s -> 19909.11s]  I need a yellow.
[19961.99s -> 19966.64s]  No rifle, Andy?
[19966.64s -> 19969.04s]  That's fine.
[19969.04s -> 19970.24s]  Let's hit me in the head.
[19985.26s -> 19990.72s]  Whoa!
[19990.72s -> 20023.92s]  No, no, no, no, no, don't do that.
[20023.92s -> 20037.49s]  What's that sound I hear?
[20037.49s -> 20041.61s]  Damn, that's pretty good against spiders.
[20041.69s -> 20059.45s]  Is that a one hit kill on the spiders?
[20059.45s -> 20060.73s]  That's a one hit kill on the spiders.
[20060.73s -> 20061.89s]  This is the spider killer.
[20061.89s -> 20063.01s]  This thing's great on spiders.
[20063.01s -> 20063.85s]  Wow, nice.
[20063.85s -> 20072.61s]  Okay, good.
[20072.61s -> 20082.38s]  Actually has a pretty good use.
[20082.38s -> 20086.20s]  Would you run with your arms out like Naruto?
[20086.20s -> 20107.89s]  No, I would run like this, just windmilling.
[20114.64s -> 20128.39s]  This is closed.
[20128.39s -> 20130.19s]  Okay, I think I see how this works.
[20130.19s -> 20131.47s]  It hurt him to do that.
[20131.47s -> 20133.79s]  You don't know what did and didn't hurt.
[20136.46s -> 20138.50s]  Yes, I'll be icing my shoulder later.
[20138.50s -> 20206.20s]  Thank you very much.
[20206.20s -> 20222.23s]  Did I shoot that out of his hand?
[20222.23s -> 20228.62s]  I agree.
[20228.62s -> 20230.02s]  Okay, gotta pull it again.
[20230.02s -> 20245.76s]  It's mine.
[20285.40s -> 20286.28s]  You gotta be kidding me.
[20286.28s -> 20301.55s]  How do I miss that point blank?
[20301.55s -> 20306.45s]  Saving ammo doing this though.
[20306.45s -> 20319.31s]  It's a good thing.
[20319.31s -> 20329.35s]  Only one shotgun.
[20329.35s -> 20335.68s]  Hold on.
[20335.68s -> 20355.46s]  Let's open this.
[20355.46s -> 20373.56s]  Not yet.
[20373.56s -> 20381.05s]  Give me that shit back.
[20381.05s -> 20387.04s]  He's saving his ammo for the Resident Evil 5 remake.
[20387.04s -> 20389.83s]  I have almost no ammo in my inventory.
[20389.83s -> 20395.71s]  What?
[20395.71s -> 20397.28s]  Look at this.
[20397.28s -> 20400.52s]  I've got 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.
[20400.56s -> 20417.18s]  I have like 16 bullets left in my entire arsenal.
[20417.18s -> 20430.88s]  Keep that open for now.
[20430.88s -> 20432.32s]  You piece of shit.
[20464.84s -> 20496.97s]  She said meeting you once was enough.
[20496.97s -> 20498.65s]  Get that little bug.
[20498.65s -> 20499.49s]  Stop.
[20499.49s -> 20501.09s]  Oh my goodness gracious.
[20510.52s -> 20518.45s]  No, where did it even come from?
[20518.45s -> 20522.36s]  I just wasted every shot.
[20522.36s -> 20527.13s]  All right, I'm gonna speed run this shit.
[20527.13s -> 20534.17s]  Oh, I can't believe I can't believe it.
[20534.17s -> 20567.51s]  Fuck.
[20567.51s -> 20581.39s]  Okay, go.
[20581.67s -> 20582.83s]  Okay, I think I see how this works.
[20582.83s -> 20583.67s]  Would you live here?
[20583.67s -> 20588.80s]  No.
[20588.80s -> 20594.07s]  No, I don't think I would.
[20594.07s -> 20629.47s]  Keep it open.
[20629.47s -> 20631.83s]  Okay.
[20631.83s -> 20633.31s]  What if it had central air?
[20633.31s -> 20636.00s]  Central heating and air.
[20637.40s -> 20638.36s]  I'd think about it.
[20690.97s -> 20693.84s]  What would you do if you were cloned?
[20693.84s -> 20695.39s]  It'd be bad.
[20695.39s -> 20698.15s]  Because initially I would make the clone do everything.
[20698.15s -> 20700.07s]  Be like, oh, hey, clone, I gotta go to the grocery store.
[20700.07s -> 20700.91s]  You go.
[20700.91s -> 20702.95s]  Hey, clone, I need you to stream.
[20702.95s -> 20704.09s]  You should go stream.
[20704.09s -> 20707.41s]  I need you to work on the wash machine, bro.
[20708.25s -> 20710.07s]  Call somebody, you figure it out, fix it.
[20710.07s -> 20711.83s]  And I would become gradually
[20711.83s -> 20715.00s]  over like a two or three, four month period.
[20715.00s -> 20718.64s]  I would gain probably 150 pounds.
[20718.64s -> 20723.94s]  So that I would be like the big unhealthy version of myself.
[20724.10s -> 20727.14s]  So it wouldn't be like, oh, look, it's Jerma.
[20727.14s -> 20728.74s]  People would know that it was,
[20728.74s -> 20731.16s]  I wouldn't be able to hide it anymore.
[20731.16s -> 20732.40s]  I would be like, yeah, you go do that.
[20732.40s -> 20733.92s]  Go do this, go do that, go do that.
[20733.92s -> 20736.20s]  And eventually I would just kind of
[20736.20s -> 20738.92s]  probably be really unhealthy.
[20738.92s -> 20743.18s]  We would have to split it.
[20744.06s -> 20745.42s]  Okay, so if you're gonna, okay,
[20745.42s -> 20747.46s]  if clone one, you're gonna stream on Monday.
[20747.46s -> 20748.98s]  I'll stream on Tuesday.
[20748.98s -> 20751.50s]  I'll do the laundry on Wednesday.
[20751.50s -> 20753.34s]  You do the laundry on, you know, next week.
[20753.34s -> 20754.18s]  You know what I'm talking about?
[20754.18s -> 20757.24s]  We'd have to make a system.
[20757.24s -> 20758.88s]  Be like having a roommate.
[20758.88s -> 20768.17s]  It would be a roommate.
[20768.17s -> 20770.97s]  But it would be a roommate that looks exactly like you.
[20770.97s -> 20777.52s]  That can do things in place of you.
[20777.52s -> 20786.06s]  You think, what about if the clone attacked me?
[20786.06s -> 20788.74s]  See, I don't know.
[20788.74s -> 20791.50s]  If the clone is me and it knows exactly
[20791.50s -> 20793.82s]  like what I would be doing and where, I don't know.
[20793.82s -> 20816.77s]  We wouldn't, it would be a stalemate.
[20816.77s -> 20818.37s]  Twins exist, you know?
[20818.37s -> 20819.29s]  Yeah, twins exist.
[20819.29s -> 20821.32s]  We're talking about a clone,
[20821.32s -> 20825.00s]  like a carbon copy of me, a clone.
[20825.00s -> 20826.24s]  That means it has all my,
[20826.24s -> 20827.88s]  I'm assuming it has all my memories.
[20827.88s -> 20832.88s]  It has all my preferences, my whole life, right?
[20833.40s -> 20858.37s]  I mean, it would be a carbon copy of me.
[20858.37s -> 20865.10s]  A clone wouldn't get the memories.
[20865.10s -> 20865.94s]  Well, that's the thing.
[20865.94s -> 20868.42s]  It would just be a clone that is a baby
[20868.42s -> 20870.66s]  that grows up into the clone of me.
[20870.66s -> 20873.84s]  Or are we talking about a machine that like,
[20873.84s -> 20892.33s]  and like another me walks out?
[20892.33s -> 20900.39s]  That was a lot of stuff.
[20900.39s -> 20903.03s]  Okay, so now I gotta go up.
[20903.03s -> 20904.51s]  This is where I died last time.
[20904.51s -> 20906.15s]  I am not dying here again.
[20908.27s -> 20919.76s]  Nope.
[20919.76s -> 20923.38s]  Oh my, I almost died again.
[20923.38s -> 20945.24s]  Just died again.
[20945.24s -> 20947.00s]  That didn't blow up.
[20947.00s -> 20958.68s]  How is it?
[20958.68s -> 20960.35s]  Somebody else.
[20960.35s -> 20986.24s]  Calm down.
[20986.24s -> 20987.08s]  How would I pull that?
[20987.08s -> 20988.08s]  I need to go this way.
[21005.88s -> 21011.90s]  I have no, I don't have any ammo.
[21043.44s -> 21090.29s]  Oh, he's running so weirdly.
[21090.29s -> 21136.09s]  Oh, I heard that guy's neck break.
[21136.09s -> 21157.95s]  Oh, get on the fucking ladder.
[21171.89s -> 21183.31s]  This shadow.
[21183.31s -> 21184.91s]  Ooh, a beetle.
[21184.91s -> 21189.08s]  Nice.
[21189.08s -> 21190.28s]  You see how weird that was?
[21190.28s -> 21191.16s]  That was weird.
[21191.16s -> 21193.24s]  That person slid in.
[21193.24s -> 21198.49s]  They skated in.
[21198.49s -> 21206.83s]  That was so weird.
[21206.83s -> 21232.67s]  Are you?
[21232.67s -> 21233.99s]  If I go up here and get hit in the head with a rock,
[21234.03s -> 21259.64s]  I'm gonna be really, really mad.
[21259.64s -> 21260.48s]  Items.
[21281.09s -> 21290.43s]  I got him.
[21296.64s -> 21300.32s]  Did he drop something?
[21300.32s -> 21303.57s]  I don't think so.
[21303.57s -> 21320.88s]  Anything else to shoot with the cannon?
[21320.88s -> 21362.31s]  Go get in the cannon and shoot him out.
[21362.31s -> 21364.76s]  I don't think there's anything else in here,
[21364.76s -> 21381.11s]  but I will look.
[21381.11s -> 21383.49s]  I love the way the game looks.
[21383.49s -> 21387.15s]  That Capcom Resident Evil engine.
[21387.15s -> 21404.21s]  I just wish they would use it for every single game.
[21404.21s -> 21406.76s]  I mean, other companies that aren't Capcom.
[21406.76s -> 21421.80s]  Sorry, I've had my fill of you guys.
[21421.84s -> 21425.26s]  I can go across still.
[21425.26s -> 21430.86s]  I don't even think about it.
[21430.86s -> 21445.82s]  Can I go down?
[21445.82s -> 21447.16s]  Really?
[21447.16s -> 21466.89s]  How could you have that many drawers and none of them open?
[21466.89s -> 21473.38s]  Oh, this part.
[21473.38s -> 21475.28s]  Ashley, where are you?
[21475.28s -> 21479.29s]  People are gonna get really mad at me here.
[21479.29s -> 21480.11s]  Are they?
[21480.11s -> 21485.48s]  Hold on.
[21485.48s -> 21486.60s]  I'll figure it out.
[21486.60s -> 21495.79s]  I'll figure it out.
[21495.79s -> 21496.63s]  I'll figure it out.
[21496.63s -> 21504.94s]  I'll be fine.
[21504.94s -> 21519.69s]  Stylish mask.
[21519.69s -> 21533.96s]  Easier this time.
[21533.96s -> 21535.88s]  I'm so scared.
[21535.88s -> 21542.10s]  Myself anymore.
[21542.10s -> 21543.90s]  Oh, something else.
[21543.90s -> 21545.18s]  She must've been terrifying now.
[21545.18s -> 21549.25s]  I know.
[21549.25s -> 21554.38s]  You too?
[21555.22s -> 21559.11s]  I should get all the way here without dying.
[21559.11s -> 21559.95s]  I don't know.
[21559.95s -> 21562.58s]  But you can't run.
[21562.58s -> 21565.88s]  You gotta keep moving forward.
[21565.88s -> 21568.68s]  We will beat this.
[21568.68s -> 21573.08s]  Together.
[21573.08s -> 21574.16s]  I don't know if I can.
[21574.16s -> 21577.25s]  You can.
[21577.25s -> 21580.05s]  Just give me heads up before you stab me next time, okay?
[21583.25s -> 21597.18s]  Leon, thanks.
[21597.18s -> 21604.05s]  Reunited.
[21604.05s -> 21618.00s]  Okay.
[21618.00s -> 21620.34s]  Luis, where are you?
[21620.34s -> 21622.94s]  Sorry, I screwed up.
[21622.94s -> 21625.82s]  Come to my rescue, Prince Charming.
[21625.82s -> 21626.66s]  I'll show you a charmer, pal.
[21626.66s -> 21627.90s]  How many chapters are there?
[21628.74s -> 21632.21s]  Come on, bastard courtyard.
[21632.21s -> 21633.41s]  Be late to the dance.
[21633.41s -> 21634.25s]  I'm a little bit,
[21634.25s -> 21636.41s]  I'm pretty much right at the halfway point, I think.
[21636.41s -> 21638.45s]  Maybe a little bit more.
[21638.45s -> 21657.24s]  When he's in trouble, we can't just leave him, right?
[21657.24s -> 21658.08s]  End of the stream, boys?
[21658.08s -> 21659.36s]  No.
[21659.36s -> 21674.64s]  No, I'll go for like another hour.
[21674.64s -> 21676.32s]  See, they know what they're doing.
[21676.32s -> 21680.92s]  I told you.
[21680.92s -> 21709.44s]  I told you.
[21709.44s -> 21713.22s]  It begins.
[21713.22s -> 21714.94s]  Need to go through here.
[21714.94s -> 21715.78s]  All right.
[21715.78s -> 21722.22s]  Get a visual for what this looks like.
[21722.22s -> 21723.06s]  I'm gonna go from here.
[21723.06s -> 21724.50s]  I'm gonna go left.
[21724.50s -> 21732.58s]  I'm gonna go left first.
[21732.58s -> 21735.04s]  Let me just check over here.
[21735.04s -> 21738.71s]  Nothing.
[21738.71s -> 21742.82s]  So when looking at the big staircase,
[21742.82s -> 21746.97s]  left is where I'm going.
[21746.97s -> 21748.53s]  I'm gonna walk, by the way.
[21748.53s -> 21752.85s]  I'm not gonna run.
[21752.85s -> 21767.15s]  Hey, let's go right.
[21767.15s -> 21775.43s]  Just eat him immediately.
[21775.43s -> 21789.01s]  Two bonus, nice.
[21789.01s -> 21795.53s]  Okay.
[21795.53s -> 21802.00s]  A lot of gunpowder.
[21802.00s -> 21803.68s]  Imagine being Ashley and watching him do that.
[21803.68s -> 21807.56s]  Yeah, me eating a snake.
[21807.56s -> 21808.40s]  Okay.
[21808.40s -> 21809.28s]  I didn't go over here.
[21846.16s -> 21851.56s]  What's that?
[21851.56s -> 21855.52s]  Nice.
[21855.52s -> 21864.11s]  Where is it?
[21864.11s -> 21866.00s]  Okay.
[21866.00s -> 21877.73s]  Nothing over here.
[21877.73s -> 21901.02s]  Dog.
[21901.02s -> 21912.34s]  What is happening?
[21912.34s -> 21913.62s]  You jumped over it.
[21913.62s -> 21915.22s]  Wait, what?
[21915.22s -> 21929.20s]  Did I let them out?
[21929.20s -> 21931.59s]  I thought they were gonna break it down.
[21931.59s -> 21933.43s]  I thought they were gonna smash it down eventually.
[21933.43s -> 21937.84s]  I was like paranoid.
[21937.84s -> 21948.08s]  Okay.
[21948.08s -> 21969.29s]  You let them out?
[21969.29s -> 21972.08s]  I don't, it's dead?
[21972.08s -> 21995.90s]  I don't think it's dead.
[21995.90s -> 22012.52s]  Ooh, elegant chessboard.
[22012.52s -> 22015.24s]  I hear something running.
[22015.24s -> 22036.34s]  God damn it.
[22036.34s -> 22037.30s]  I missed that somehow.
[22037.30s -> 22049.07s]  I don't care.
[22049.07s -> 22051.51s]  There's one flag, two more.
[22060.34s -> 22073.06s]  Can you look out for dogs, please?
[22073.70s -> 22074.54s]  Don't be rude.
[22074.54s -> 22075.38s]  Don't be rude to Ashley.
[22075.38s -> 22090.35s]  I'm not being rude.
[22090.35s -> 22113.65s]  Please refill that.
[22113.65s -> 22114.49s]  They're just too useful.
[22114.49s -> 22124.98s]  I need them.
[22124.98s -> 22125.82s]  All right.
[22125.82s -> 22128.03s]  Where did I come from?
[22128.03s -> 22128.87s]  Came from here.
[22128.87s -> 22129.85s]  So I could go straight.
[22129.85s -> 22133.74s]  I'm gonna go straight.
[22133.74s -> 22148.70s]  Right across.
[22148.70s -> 22149.54s]  Like in here.
[22210.37s -> 22216.08s]  You can just hear them like.
[22216.08s -> 22217.35s]  Put this down.
[22217.35s -> 22230.06s]  Okay.
[22230.06s -> 22244.51s]  Careful.
[22244.51s -> 22257.73s]  Dude.
[22257.73s -> 22258.57s]  Where's the last one?
[22259.88s -> 22265.48s]  That one's pulled down.
[22265.48s -> 22269.74s]  Where's the last one?
[22269.74s -> 22270.95s]  Right here?
[22270.95s -> 22271.79s]  Okay.
[22271.79s -> 22273.87s]  It's right here.
[22273.87s -> 22278.02s]  Uh-oh.
[22278.02s -> 22283.16s]  Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[22283.92s -> 22284.76s]  Why'd you let go?
[22284.76s -> 22285.76s]  Where are you going?
[22285.76s -> 22287.57s]  Where are you?
[22287.57s -> 22288.41s]  Why did you run away?
[22288.41s -> 22289.23s]  I was gonna come get you.
[22289.23s -> 22309.70s]  What are you doing?
[22309.70s -> 22312.65s]  Get out of the way.
[22312.65s -> 22313.57s]  Question.
[22313.57s -> 22314.51s]  It's like The Sims.
[22314.51s -> 22316.13s]  There's a fire over there.
[22316.13s -> 22318.00s]  Will you just relax?
[22318.00s -> 22328.97s]  I'm trying to.
[22328.97s -> 22329.81s]  We're good.
[22329.81s -> 22330.65s]  We're good.
[22330.65s -> 22331.80s]  We're good.
[22331.80s -> 22332.92s]  Please don't kill me.
[22339.49s -> 22340.85s]  Thank God this was loaded.
[22354.36s -> 22355.20s]  Okay.
[22355.20s -> 22356.95s]  This whole thing got fucked up though.
[22356.95s -> 22379.84s]  I gotta go that way.
[22379.84s -> 22384.32s]  This was not that bad.
[22384.32s -> 22385.40s]  Please do a suplex.
[22385.40s -> 22395.29s]  I don't even know how.
[22395.29s -> 22411.46s]  God.
[22411.46s -> 22418.95s]  I didn't want to miss anything.
[22418.95s -> 22420.86s]  All right.
[22420.86s -> 22421.70s]  This is it.
[22421.70s -> 22423.02s]  I think I got pretty much everything.
[22423.02s -> 22428.56s]  I think I missed one item, maybe.
[22428.56s -> 22429.68s]  You have to be on their knees
[22429.68s -> 22432.17s]  and you have to be behind them.
[22432.17s -> 22433.01s]  Shoot somebody in the knee
[22433.01s -> 22434.05s]  and then they lay from behind.
[22434.05s -> 22434.89s]  Okay.
[22434.89s -> 22436.89s]  Now we can finally get out of this maze.
[22446.93s -> 22448.93s]  This is why I crafted it.
[22448.93s -> 22459.23s]  There you go.
[22459.23s -> 22475.05s]  That's why I crafted it.
[22475.05s -> 22482.66s]  They're not over here, are they?
[22482.66s -> 22484.32s]  I didn't really miss much.
[22484.32s -> 22487.69s]  I don't think I missed anything.
[22487.69s -> 22489.13s]  We're gonna raid.
[22489.13s -> 22492.04s]  Hey, Boon, thanks for the raid.
[22492.04s -> 22493.97s]  Welcome, everybody.
[22494.01s -> 22496.07s]  Playing Resident Evil 5.
[22496.07s -> 22506.04s]  Thank you, Boon.
[22506.04s -> 22508.73s]  Four, four, four.
[22508.73s -> 22509.57s]  Right.
[22509.57s -> 22511.13s]  Did I say five?
[22511.13s -> 22513.09s]  This is just so confidently wrong.
[22513.09s -> 22514.89s]  That was confidently incorrect.
[22514.89s -> 22516.57s]  Not some new wares, stranger.
[22516.57s -> 22520.32s]  You're in for a treat.
[22520.32s -> 22528.02s]  Little medallions in the hall, okay.
[22528.02s -> 22530.62s]  I can do even more nasty upgrades
[22530.62s -> 22531.62s]  on those weapons of yours
[22531.62s -> 22534.08s]  and make them sing even louder.
[22534.08s -> 22536.74s]  Was this like another upgrade system?
[22536.74s -> 22539.26s]  Oh no.
[22539.26s -> 22540.40s]  Welcome.
[22540.40s -> 22545.02s]  I've got something new for you, mates.
[22545.02s -> 22549.06s]  That cash in your pocket or your life.
[22549.06s -> 22551.14s]  Easy choice, mate.
[22551.14s -> 22553.50s]  Always do the case upgrade.
[22553.50s -> 22557.40s]  Enough to get the job done, surely.
[22557.40s -> 22559.80s]  Oh, there's even more.
[22559.80s -> 22562.96s]  Your weapons are in good hands, mate.
[22562.96s -> 22567.43s]  I'll see you right.
[22567.43s -> 22575.00s]  It's definitely a shotgun.
[22575.00s -> 22578.23s]  I'll buy almost anything.
[22578.23s -> 22581.03s]  He, he, he, he, thank you.
[22581.03s -> 22583.91s]  Oh, this is gonna be worth like 50, 60 grand.
[22583.91s -> 22586.50s]  Got a scum.
[22586.66s -> 22599.20s]  Double red, two, right?
[22599.20s -> 22601.17s]  Double red.
[22601.17s -> 22606.52s]  This is, this is triple red, isn't it?
[22606.52s -> 22608.88s]  Yeah.
[22608.88s -> 22611.92s]  Or should I do yellow?
[22611.92s -> 22615.04s]  Triple is better than, yeah, no, triple's better.
[22615.04s -> 22619.97s]  43,000, that's pretty damn good.
[22619.97s -> 22624.57s]  Any welcome.
[22624.57s -> 22626.59s]  What about yellow, yellow?
[22626.59s -> 22627.63s]  Ruby's all rubbish.
[22627.63s -> 22629.31s]  It makes no difference.
[22629.31s -> 22631.40s]  The price will.
[22631.40s -> 22636.50s]  I think triple would be better than yellow, yellow.
[22636.50s -> 22638.14s]  Hold it, onto it.
[22638.14s -> 22640.77s]  Why?
[22640.77s -> 22641.69s]  Try to get four?
[22641.69s -> 22647.83s]  Try to get another one to do four red?
[22647.83s -> 22652.91s]  It's true.
[22652.91s -> 22665.96s]  Easy work.
[22665.96s -> 22669.48s]  Molding a weapon to suit your specific means.
[22669.48s -> 22676.04s]  Oh, it's a thing of beauty, isn't it?
[22676.04s -> 22687.08s]  Hmm, this is important.
[22687.08s -> 22690.96s]  This kind of work is about finesse, stranger.
[22690.96s -> 22694.68s]  Little bit goes a long way, you'll see.
[22695.84s -> 22698.64s]  There you are, as you wished.
[22698.64s -> 22700.00s]  Will that be all then?
[22702.03s -> 22704.04s]  Whoa.
[22704.04s -> 22707.80s]  There's some things money can't buy.
[22707.80s -> 22719.04s]  Heh heh, good it, Liz.
[22719.04s -> 22720.68s]  I need more of these square ones.
[22744.04s -> 22744.92s]  Well, I have room.
[22744.92s -> 22746.80s]  I could probably bring the magnum now,
[22746.80s -> 22750.89s]  just in case I wouldn't bring it.
[22750.89s -> 22754.47s]  Might as well.
[22754.47s -> 22759.52s]  Nah, just leave it.
[22759.52s -> 22767.56s]  Kind of low on healing.
[22767.56s -> 22768.56s]  There's a gumball machine.
[22768.56s -> 22774.92s]  Well, that's what we're about to do right now.
[22774.92s -> 22776.60s]  I'm gonna imagine this is probably the last thing
[22776.60s -> 22779.24s]  I'm gonna do on the stream,
[22779.24s -> 22784.14s]  because I'm about to go down here,
[22784.14s -> 22806.40s]  and I'll probably be here for a while.
[22806.40s -> 22809.14s]  Rare.
[22809.14s -> 22834.69s]  Yes, I have to go 100% health recovery for black bass.
[22834.69s -> 22835.53s]  Is that good?
[22835.53s -> 22837.92s]  That means I have to go farm the lake for food,
[22837.92s -> 22853.49s]  but they take up so much space.
[22853.49s -> 22854.73s]  That's actually pretty good.
[22854.73s -> 22858.80s]  They spawn all the time.
[22858.80s -> 22874.53s]  Okay, let's do it.
[22874.53s -> 22925.90s]  I've never shot this weapon so far.
[22925.90s -> 22931.05s]  Thanks, Ashley.
[22931.05s -> 22936.51s]  That's pretty good.
[22936.51s -> 22943.33s]  Where am I missing the other ones?
[22943.33s -> 22989.76s]  In the barrels?
[22989.76s -> 22991.17s]  Stupid.
[22991.21s -> 22992.81s]  I'm so bad with the machine gun.
[23030.38s -> 23053.05s]  Shit!
[23053.05s -> 23057.99s]  I would have had it too.
[23057.99s -> 23063.68s]  I would have had it.
[23063.68s -> 23076.05s]  Controller is wet.
[23076.05s -> 23077.05s]  It's so inaccurate.
[23077.05s -> 23078.25s]  How are you supposed to do that?
[23078.25s -> 23079.09s]  Relively.
[23111.51s -> 23112.35s]  You!
[23122.78s -> 23125.16s]  Can you go in the other room?
[23125.16s -> 23127.28s]  If you're just, you're annoying.
[23127.28s -> 23129.24s]  She's just like, you're shocked.
[23129.24s -> 23130.08s]  She's not even saying that.
[23130.08s -> 23144.60s]  She was being very supportive.
[23144.60s -> 23145.48s]  You give me the shotgun,
[23145.48s -> 23170.26s]  and I'm gonna perfect it every time.
[23170.26s -> 23247.33s]  Reload?
[23247.65s -> 23248.49s]  Whatever.
[23270.34s -> 23283.00s]  I fucking hate the machine gun.
[23283.00s -> 23310.91s]  Oh, I hate the machine gun.
[23310.91s -> 23311.87s]  Come on.
[23311.87s -> 23314.09s]  What?
[23314.09s -> 23321.32s]  What the fuck?
[23321.32s -> 23334.22s]  Reload the gun.
[23334.22s -> 23337.42s]  Oh, that's gonna be so hard to do that.
[23337.42s -> 23340.64s]  That's gonna be hard as absolute hell to do that.
[23340.64s -> 23342.04s]  This shit is so inaccurate.
[23345.12s -> 23346.24s]  Just give me the bonus.
[23391.30s -> 23400.42s]  No, press the fucking button.
[23400.46s -> 23402.26s]  I hate the double weapon one.
[23402.26s -> 23421.56s]  Just only use the shotgun as the only weapon to use.
[23421.56s -> 23424.87s]  No!
[23424.87s -> 23426.03s]  I better get the bonus.
[23455.05s -> 23469.43s]  I hate this gun so much.
[23469.43s -> 23470.47s]  I feel like that's chat.
[23470.47s -> 23471.31s]  It's like, it's all right.
[23471.31s -> 23472.13s]  Hey, nice job.
[23472.13s -> 23472.97s]  You're doing great.
[23472.97s -> 23473.81s]  You're doing a good job.
[23473.81s -> 23474.63s]  Don't worry.
[23474.63s -> 23475.77s]  You're doing good.
[23475.77s -> 23476.61s]  I'm just sitting here like,
[23476.61s -> 23509.25s]  I hate this fucking game.
[23509.25s -> 23519.95s]  Wow.
[23519.95s -> 23526.18s]  What are you?
[23526.18s -> 23527.18s]  Oh my God.
[23527.18s -> 23530.42s]  It's the most inaccurate piece of shit gun in the whole game.
[23530.42s -> 23531.78s]  It's not even worth it.
[23531.78s -> 23534.54s]  It's the biggest piece of shit in the game.
[23534.54s -> 23538.30s]  It's just like the accuracy is this big square
[23538.30s -> 23615.30s]  and it's just good luck.
[23615.30s -> 23621.07s]  I don't know.
[23621.07s -> 23665.22s]  Did I do it?
[23665.22s -> 23666.04s]  I don't know.
[23666.04s -> 23678.96s]  It doesn't matter.
[23678.96s -> 23679.80s]  Oh my goodness.
[23679.80s -> 23714.44s]  He moved right at the very end.
[23714.44s -> 23715.48s]  I want the gold coin.
[23730.19s -> 23731.52s]  Let me out.
[23731.52s -> 23732.36s]  Let me out of here.
[23732.36s -> 23733.96s]  Let me out of here.
[23733.96s -> 23749.52s]  I hate this weapon.
[23749.52s -> 23760.10s]  Quiet for a second.
[23760.10s -> 23762.99s]  That's an epic.
[23762.99s -> 23771.68s]  Illuminado's emblem plus 20% melee critical hit rate.
[23771.76s -> 23775.54s]  Melee crit rate.
[23775.54s -> 23784.58s]  Does that mean I can just swing the knife?
[23784.58s -> 23789.06s]  That sounds unbelievable.
[23789.06s -> 23791.72s]  Is it crit kicks?
[23791.72s -> 23797.62s]  Oh, that might be amazing.
[23797.62s -> 23799.46s]  I have to get the other one, right?
[23799.46s -> 23805.98s]  I have to.
[23805.98s -> 23814.09s]  I could do this, right?
[23814.09s -> 23817.38s]  There we go.
[23817.38s -> 23820.30s]  Wow.
[23820.30s -> 23823.20s]  20% weapon resale value.
[23823.20s -> 23843.52s]  Incredible.
[23843.52s -> 23853.62s]  Nice.
[23853.62s -> 23855.02s]  It was really cool.
[23855.02s -> 23855.86s]  I could get the other one,
[23855.86s -> 23858.16s]  but one more try.
[23858.16s -> 23862.12s]  No, I hate that gun.
[23862.12s -> 23867.62s]  That's cool.
[23867.62s -> 23875.51s]  200% health from Bass.
[23875.51s -> 23877.62s]  So I'm curious.
[23877.70s -> 23878.91s]  Welcome.
[23878.91s -> 23882.70s]  What can I interest you in?
[23882.70s -> 23884.18s]  So the riot gun is 152,000.
[23884.18s -> 23886.58s]  Your valuables won't do you much.
[23886.58s -> 23888.90s]  Next time, buy something.
[23888.90s -> 23905.06s]  So if I put this on,
[23905.06s -> 23923.39s]  that's so ridiculous.
[23923.39s -> 23925.55s]  I don't know.
[23925.55s -> 23929.12s]  I'm not gonna put the Bass one on.
[23929.12s -> 23932.18s]  Or the magnum.
[23932.18s -> 23933.68s]  Oh, it's already on there.
[23933.68s -> 23935.80s]  All right, so now it was 157.
[23935.80s -> 23941.39s]  Well, what is it now?
[23941.39s -> 23942.23s]  What?
[23942.23s -> 23943.93s]  I'll buy almost anything.
[23943.93s -> 23944.77s]  How did it go down?
[23944.77s -> 23952.49s]  Suit yourself, stranger.
[23952.49s -> 23953.37s]  20%.
[23953.37s -> 23955.33s]  It was 152,700.
[23955.33s -> 23956.17s]  That's not 20.
[23956.17s -> 23963.23s]  20% would be like 20, 30K, 40K.
[23963.23s -> 23968.00s]  Plus 20% weapon resale value.
[23968.00s -> 23969.60s]  That'd be $30,000.
[23969.60s -> 23975.60s]  Was it 127 or 157?
[23975.60s -> 23977.76s]  What is it?
[23977.76s -> 23979.12s]  It doesn't count the upgrades.
[23979.12s -> 23980.28s]  Welcome.
[23980.28s -> 23984.08s]  Got a selection of good things on sale.
[23984.08s -> 23984.92s]  How is it?
[23984.92s -> 23986.94s]  What?
[23986.94s -> 23991.60s]  Look at the mask you got.
[23991.60s -> 23994.73s]  Hold on.
[23994.73s -> 24003.92s]  It's not that good then.
[24003.92s -> 24005.92s]  I'll leave the magnum on.
[24005.92s -> 24011.08s]  It's kind of unfortunate.
[24011.08s -> 24011.92s]  All right.
[24011.92s -> 24013.84s]  Oh, the mask, right.
[24013.84s -> 24018.16s]  Save it.
[24018.16s -> 24024.89s]  And then I will, we'll check out the mask.
[24024.89s -> 24026.73s]  An extra 3K.
[24026.73s -> 24029.71s]  It's not 20%.
[24029.71s -> 24036.18s]  It's all right though.
[24036.18s -> 24060.95s]  You have more than one.
[24060.95s -> 24062.59s]  So how much money do I got?
[24062.59s -> 24064.07s]  360.
[24064.07s -> 24065.51s]  Can't really do much else.
[24065.51s -> 24068.13s]  This is probably a good place to stop.
[24068.13s -> 24069.73s]  Seven hours or so.
[24069.73s -> 24070.57s]  What's right?
[24070.57s -> 24077.01s]  I think there's a boss coming up really soon here.
[24077.01s -> 24087.71s]  Let me shoot these things in the hall.
[24087.71s -> 24090.11s]  Look, there's a statue up there.
[24090.11s -> 24091.79s]  Oh no, I got a while.
[24091.79s -> 24093.79s]  You're gonna put the three or four heads on this, right?
[24093.79s -> 24094.63s]  Yeah.
[24094.63s -> 24096.11s]  I got a long time.
[24096.11s -> 24099.87s]  At least another hour or two.
[24099.87s -> 24112.03s]  Let me just do this.
[24112.03s -> 24112.87s]  Where's that one?
[24112.87s -> 24118.54s]  That one, there's two on the ground floor.
[24141.02s -> 24144.46s]  Three.
[24144.46s -> 24150.02s]  And the last ones are deeper in, which I'll go this way.
[24150.02s -> 24151.10s]  Yeah.
[24151.10s -> 24153.04s]  No, we're good.
[24153.04s -> 24165.59s]  Yeah, that's gonna be it.
[24165.59s -> 24166.43s]  Where is it?
[24166.87s -> 24167.95s]  There it is.
[24167.95s -> 24168.79s]  Wait, where is it?
[24187.74s -> 24188.98s]  Already got it?
[24188.98s -> 24189.82s]  No, no, no, no.
[24189.82s -> 24197.00s]  There's a, there's a treasure here.
[24197.00s -> 24221.48s]  I can hear it swaying around.
[24221.48s -> 24222.32s]  Where is it?
[24246.02s -> 24251.20s]  It's right there.
[24251.20s -> 24266.84s]  Ooh.
[24266.84s -> 24268.77s]  I will see you guys later.
[24268.77s -> 24272.48s]  I might, I think I'm streaming tomorrow.
[24272.48s -> 24278.54s]  So the plan.
[24278.54s -> 24280.00s]  So I will see you guys.
[24283.44s -> 24287.32s]  Yeah, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[24287.32s -> 24290.94s]  Tomorrow as in Sunday.
[24290.94s -> 24291.78s]  Probably around the same time,
[24291.78s -> 24293.60s]  probably around like five or six.
[24293.60s -> 24297.03s]  We'll keep doing this, gonna keep playing it.
[24297.91s -> 24303.85s]  And that's it.
[24303.85s -> 24304.69s]  See you guys tomorrow.
[24304.69s -> 24313.85s]  I don't need to, all right, I saved it, right?
[24313.85s -> 24315.72s]  Yeah, thanks for watching guys.
[24315.72s -> 24318.14s]  See you tomorrow.
[24318.14s -> 24320.51s]  That's gonna be it.
[24320.51s -> 24321.39s]  It's great.
[24321.39s -> 24326.56s]  It's genuinely as much fun as I had playing the other one.
[24326.56s -> 24330.42s]  We talked earlier about how, is it better?
[24330.42s -> 24331.66s]  Is it worse?
[24331.66s -> 24333.58s]  I think it's kind of just another version.
[24333.58s -> 24335.38s]  It's another version of it and it's very good.
[24335.38s -> 24337.92s]  They're both fantastic.
[24337.92s -> 24339.96s]  I love this game.
[24339.96s -> 24343.68s]  Very, very good.
[24343.68s -> 24348.20s]  I don't think I even need to give you a final assessment.
[24348.20s -> 24349.60s]  It's just one of the best games ever made.
[24349.60s -> 24352.08s]  It just is one of the best games I've probably ever played.
[24352.08s -> 24356.13s]  It's in the top 10, top 20, probably.
[24356.13s -> 24360.58s]  But we will continue it tomorrow.
[24360.58s -> 24362.23s]  Take care.
[24362.23s -> 24364.88s]  Get some sleep.
[24364.88s -> 24366.12s]  See you around five or six o'clock.
[24366.12s -> 24367.40s]  We'll just put six.
[24367.40s -> 24368.52s]  If I show up a little bit early,
[24368.52s -> 24376.64s]  I might show up a little bit early.
[24376.64s -> 24388.37s]  I'm not trying to beat it tomorrow, for those wondering.
[24388.37s -> 24392.03s]  There's at least another 10 to 12 hours,
[24392.03s -> 24397.18s]  I think, in the game.
[24397.18s -> 24399.60s]  It's gonna go at the pace we're going.
[24399.60s -> 24400.56s]  Maybe another few streams,
[24400.56s -> 24409.26s]  two or three streams, I would imagine.
[24409.34s -> 24412.05s]  Three, six hour streams,
[24412.05s -> 24413.53s]  two, seven or eight hour streams.
[24413.53s -> 24415.38s]  We'll see.
[24415.38s -> 24416.70s]  I'm not gonna put a time limit on it
[24416.70s -> 24423.54s]  and I'm not gonna rush through it either, right?
[24423.54s -> 24425.10s]  Well, I'm not gonna put a time limit on it
[24425.10s -> 24428.64s]  and I'm not going to go too slow either.
[24428.64s -> 24435.71s]  I'm gonna go as exactly as I wanna go.
[24435.71s -> 24436.55s]  Thanks for sticking around.
[24436.55s -> 24437.39s]  See you tomorrow.
[24437.39s -> 24438.21s]  Good night.
[24438.21s -> 24439.42s]  Goodbye.
[24439.42s -> 24440.26s]  Have a good one.
[24440.26s -> 24441.25s]  Call your mother.
[24441.25s -> 24448.16s]  See you soon.
[24448.16s -> 24502.42s]  Take care.
