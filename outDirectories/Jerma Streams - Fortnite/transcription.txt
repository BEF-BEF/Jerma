[996.46s -> 1003.02s]  What are they gonna do send the weekend? I i am honestly if if this if this gets like muted this part of the stream
[1003.10s -> 1028.82s]  And I don't really necessarily care
[1029.94s -> 1034.10s]  You also like can't cancel it. Okay licensed audio mute all
[1035.85s -> 1040.78s]  Yeah, why is it gondam style? That's so good. Yeah, there's a dance
[1041.50s -> 1046.71s]  Uh, it's just so big 10 years ago and they brought it back for fortnight
[1047.74s -> 1052.74s]  There's no music replacements. You just kind of do that. I don't think there's no I don't I don't think
[1053.14s -> 1066.65s]  Why do I feel like the whole game muted? But no, it's um, good to see you guys again. We're good to hear from you again
[1067.67s -> 1070.31s]  Yes, sir. We were we were very excited to hear that you were our captain
[1070.71s -> 1076.41s]  I found out I was your captain when um, I can't when I came in the call, so i'm ready to leave the ship
[1078.84s -> 1080.84s]  Steer it in the right direction
[1080.84s -> 1082.60s]  Yeah
[1082.60s -> 1087.40s]  A ludwig augren production. Can I can I paint you a little picture of how we how we got here?
[1088.04s -> 1092.10s]  So last fortnight monday, um, we had a son on our team
[1092.82s -> 1094.07s]  uh
[1094.07s -> 1099.91s]  Who has played a little more than you have but has has played probably a just as significant amount of as you have
[1100.57s -> 1102.81s]  And uh, we got destroyed. We got second to last
[1103.85s -> 1110.86s]  Um since then ludwig nick me and hasan since then we have put in some serious hours
[1110.86s -> 1112.86s]  We've been dropping tilted constantly
[1113.42s -> 1115.42s]  Uh, we've been discussing strategy
[1116.06s -> 1116.94s]  um
[1116.94s -> 1118.94s]  We consulted our friend's little brother
[1119.02s -> 1122.87s]  Uh, because he that was huge that was because he because he's like 16
[1123.11s -> 1128.09s]  So we asked him how he would approach this and I think we're ready to place top three
[1128.33s -> 1135.62s]  I I mean look I I might not know fortnight, but you get the you take the building out
[1136.26s -> 1141.32s]  I have like three four thousand hours in team fortress too. Yeah, you point and you shoot, you know
[1142.15s -> 1146.39s]  And I mean like I've just completed elden ring. It's just a better cartoon shooter
[1146.39s -> 1152.04s]  You're gonna be fine. Yeah, you got it. Everybody said congratulations, but it's all right
[1152.52s -> 1155.16s]  Oh, you're talking about yeah, it's super weird
[1155.24s -> 1159.64s]  Well, I mean I just said I just I just completed elden ring and I just figured that it was gonna get like a bunch of like
[1159.64s -> 1165.22s]  Claps and stuff, but no. Yeah, I heard that I I heard that so
[1165.86s -> 1174.90s]  Fortnight so better what what are people spending better for no one asked?
[1178.70s -> 1180.70s]  Codes up codes up. Oh
[1181.90s -> 1192.06s]  Okay, putting our code in so should I ready up? Um once I do yeah
[1194.23s -> 1196.23s]  At sapnap. It's a pleasure to meet you by the way
[1198.10s -> 1201.48s]  All right. We should be able to ready
[1201.48s -> 1203.08s]  I have the code in
[1203.08s -> 1207.00s]  Oh, sorry. I was using the restroom. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. I had my wireless headset on
[1208.02s -> 1211.62s]  You were listening to us while you were in the restroom. Yeah, you did special
[1211.94s -> 1216.25s]  That's the bond. I just left my headset on muted my mic got up and went to pee
[1216.73s -> 1221.13s]  That's a good idea actually and I heard just in case I was gonna miss someone is it time to ready up?
[1222.02s -> 1228.74s]  Uh, I think so. Yeah, i'm hitting it. Uh, should we just do it? Yes, sir. All right
[1229.32s -> 1233.26s]  Surprise for the table. I gotta put both headphones in for this
[1237.56s -> 1241.64s]  Okay, jerma big big, uh big thing for I think battle royales in general
[1242.20s -> 1247.00s]  The worst thing you can hear when your teammate when something is happening to your teammate is they're over there
[1247.32s -> 1250.20s]  Because no one knows what you're talking about, right? So there's a ping button
[1250.20s -> 1258.17s]  I believe it's mapped to z very helpful for saying over there and then it's like beep beep. You got it also
[1258.33s -> 1267.56s]  Um, I do have some battle royale experience not with this one of g-mobile. Okay, wait
[1268.92s -> 1275.54s]  Mobile, that's not a joke. I actually I played the mobile pubg a lot of airport hours. Were you nice, sir?
[1276.31s -> 1278.71s]  I mean I was just in I was just did it in bed just lying in bed
[1281.83s -> 1284.18s]  Oh, yeah, I think you need to ready up nick. I did what?
[1285.38s -> 1289.38s]  So I understand the concept of the shrinking zone of like the landing in different places picking up web
[1289.38s -> 1297.66s]  Okay, what's a good weapon? What should I be looking for? I think the the meta is like aug plus. Um, what's the the shotgun?
[1298.30s -> 1300.86s]  the big amount of ammo
[1301.34s -> 1305.10s]  The drum one I think drum. Yeah, I think it's aug plus drum plus
[1305.83s -> 1314.18s]  Uh the things that launch you and then two heels is what I was told. That's like the meta. There's uh, there's smgs
[1314.26s -> 1316.04s]  They're kind of unwieldy
[1316.04s -> 1317.83s]  Usually not worth it
[1317.83s -> 1322.47s]  But the the rifles are like where your bread and butter is going to be are your mouths moving on your characters when you know
[1322.55s -> 1324.55s]  They're not okay. Oh, yeah the dog
[1325.91s -> 1336.31s]  Everyone keeps saying that I was like, whoa, that's kind of cool. Are we supposed to switch to na west?
[1337.42s -> 1341.42s]  We are on na west. Oh, okay. This ain't gonna start in 30 minutes, right?
[1343.40s -> 1347.56s]  Um, it should start immediately or once everyone's ready once everyone's in
[1347.88s -> 1353.40s]  I think the 30 minute thing you're seeing is like a different thing. It's like the duo tournament. Okay pop up
[1353.64s -> 1362.55s]  I feel like I feel like i'm gonna surprise a lot of people
[1363.51s -> 1370.44s]  Why does it say only 28 cute am I I didn't do it wrong, right? No, I think i'm just waiting or
[1371.40s -> 1376.87s]  No, i'm not buying i'm not gonna buy a skin. No, it's too late. I'm just gonna play
[1378.34s -> 1381.90s]  Remember you might be cracked in this I might be this is a surprise to us
[1382.89s -> 1386.73s]  Yeah, I didn't I wasn't expecting that but I mean it's whatever i'm ready to i'm ready to game
[1387.21s -> 1398.28s]  Ready to click heads. Oh, yeah, I love that dude. So I know this this healing right like bandages and that kind of thing
[1398.44s -> 1398.84s]  Yeah
[1398.84s -> 1399.08s]  Yeah
[1399.08s -> 1404.36s]  So big big thing you want to remember if you so there's little pots and small pots and they give you different amounts of shield
[1405.24s -> 1407.32s]  Uh, you're gonna want to use those little pots first
[1407.64s -> 1408.12s]  Okay
[1408.12s -> 1413.16s]  The reason being is if you already have 50 shield and you try to take a little pot the game doesn't let you
[1413.85s -> 1417.21s]  So you want to use the little pots to hit 50 and then use the big pot to hit 100
[1418.89s -> 1422.86s]  Yo, can one of you guys discord live stream?
[1422.86s -> 1424.38s]  uh
[1424.38s -> 1434.73s]  Yeah, I probably should be me ty just one. Thank you. I love it a little late, but uh
[1435.77s -> 1444.28s]  The thought that counts I work on like 1500 millisecond ping so you get the internal delay
[1444.60s -> 1455.27s]  So that happens when you're almost 40 one day the zoomers will be old bro. Not me. That'll be funny. You guys
[1455.99s -> 1458.49s]  Not um, i'm chilling
[1460.98s -> 1462.98s]  I've been using lotion. I'm like all
[1464.34s -> 1466.34s]  I'm all slippery and
[1466.50s -> 1470.74s]  Hard to catch. No, no, seriously though. Actually actually moisturize your faces like seriously do that
[1472.46s -> 1476.86s]  I was once told by a makeup professional doing makeup on my face for a thing
[1477.18s -> 1482.62s]  She said if you moisturize you will never age and she said it with like this ancient wisdom and I was like, yes
[1483.34s -> 1486.62s]  Okay, now that that's actually dead serious like when you come out of the shower
[1487.10s -> 1491.42s]  You had like a really good light face moisturizer. That should be the first thing you do after you dry your face
[1491.90s -> 1498.86s]  Dry your face. Let it sit for a second moisturize. Trust me. I'm gonna remember this forever
[1499.88s -> 1507.75s]  You your 40 year old face is gonna thank you when you're fucking 40 and old and weird. You'll be looking smooth
[1509.35s -> 1513.51s]  Moist I might be weird, but i'll be in otter. I'll be moving around
[1514.63s -> 1518.86s]  You should have a whole skincare routine. I don't know. It should really we really should be pushing this
[1519.10s -> 1523.19s]  I think it's hard for dudes, you know
[1524.09s -> 1526.89s]  I wasn't caught this, you know as a young man
[1527.99s -> 1531.11s]  I just ate taco bell and wore hoodies and rolled around
[1532.07s -> 1536.63s]  And slop. Yeah, so so that's not dude culture. I think you're trying to imply that
[1537.83s -> 1539.83s]  I didn't I wasn't doing that
[1540.23s -> 1542.55s]  Yeah, I know. It's just like the normal like american
[1543.35s -> 1547.99s]  And rolled around and slop. Yeah, it's like what you did. Like it's what I did culturally
[1548.07s -> 1552.87s]  I am literate. He's from colorado is kind of like part of the whole yeah is what I think there colorado is nice
[1552.95s -> 1555.43s]  I like colorado colorado. Yeah, it's some great slop
[1561.91s -> 1575.16s]  People say i'm actually the american psycho no, I I just like I I want to take care of my face
[1578.01s -> 1585.37s]  Is it psychotic to moisturize honestly once this goes it's over dude you as a patrick bateman deep fake is so funny
[1586.65s -> 1589.06s]  I'm thinking about that right now
[1589.06s -> 1594.42s]  One of my favorite moments I think it's like jackass one the movie, uh, it's like johnny noxville like
[1595.14s -> 1599.30s]  He he he gets hit by like a claymore mine that has like rubber balls in it
[1599.86s -> 1605.06s]  And they hit him all over his body his body's like insanely bruised and he's like kind of limping out after it happens
[1605.06s -> 1610.18s]  And he's like circling his face. He's like is this okay face good. Oh, we're good. Right?
[1612.26s -> 1614.82s]  No, it's true. I mean I used to be in the gym all the time
[1615.06s -> 1620.26s]  I used to work out all the time like three four days a week and then like I started to kind of get like that
[1620.82s -> 1626.23s]  Weird like attack on titan monster body where like my my like stomach's like too big
[1626.31s -> 1631.83s]  But like my shoulders are not wide enough to make sense and my like waist is small. My ass is huge
[1632.49s -> 1636.17s]  Yeah, you look like you look like someone was just fucking around in the tony hawk building character
[1636.57s -> 1639.53s]  Can be kind of uh, so I mean I gotta make sure this stays around
[1643.50s -> 1646.62s]  And the hair too the hair's got to stick around for a while too. I gotta be honest with you
[1647.10s -> 1649.84s]  Yeah, I started to look like the pill from osmosis jones
[1649.92s -> 1652.35s]  Uh
[1660.96s -> 1665.12s]  People are demanding I buy a skin. I don't what's what's even available. You should buy a skin
[1665.36s -> 1669.20s]  I wasn't gonna say that but I don't want to like go get my credit card mentioned it
[1670.89s -> 1677.52s]  Yeah, get get your money up. Not your phone up. Yeah, it's pretty big. Do I have to put my credit card in?
[1679.42s -> 1681.74s]  Well, it's it's not gonna run on magic. This isn't unicef
[1682.62s -> 1684.22s]  Hold on. Let me let me turn all my kid
[1684.22s -> 1687.42s]  I don't want anyone to see like the reflection of my eyes of my screen putting my credit card in
[1687.66s -> 1690.84s]  How much money how much money do I need?
[1690.92s -> 1691.88s]  Uh
[1691.88s -> 1695.24s]  How much what's the v-book transfer like 20 30 100 bucks, whatever?
[1696.36s -> 1701.40s]  100 what no, I put a hundred like 20 50 like you put a hundred dollars in
[1703.74s -> 1704.62s]  Oh
[1704.62s -> 1710.20s]  About 100 the 799 one. How about that one? That's pretty good. Thank god. I'm not showing this on screen, right? No
[1711.85s -> 1718.35s]  Yeah, thousands enough for like like bubble gum or like maybe like one of your shoes
[1718.83s -> 1722.59s]  Okay, so add funds to wallet right place the order
[1724.73s -> 1726.01s]  Did it work?
[1726.01s -> 1728.51s]  Thank you. Okay, so I should have
[1729.77s -> 1734.33s]  Okay. So now if I go to item shop, I have a thousand I have one thousand v bucks
[1734.99s -> 1740.89s]  Okay, it doesn't sound as much as it might be but that will get you a skin. All right. So what what should I do?
[1741.77s -> 1746.81s]  Well now you can go to the item shop on the top and sort of browse and anything you can afford
[1747.77s -> 1749.77s]  Which is not much for the thousand it is true
[1750.01s -> 1757.18s]  You can but I think you can get i'm seeing envoy which is like a hot like green haired spy woman
[1757.84s -> 1759.84s]  um, you don't have enough for the
[1760.40s -> 1765.53s]  Fish in astronaut suit. I don't have enough to do this. I have to buy the
[1766.17s -> 1768.33s]  I'd buy on okay. What else is there?
[1769.05s -> 1773.93s]  This is the only thing that's available. This is all that's available. It's envoy or I believe wind walker echo
[1775.23s -> 1779.72s]  Which is like a sort of like a mage. I don't know
[1780.36s -> 1793.36s]  Wind it's uncommon green. Oh, okay wind walker echo. I guess i'm gonna do
[1793.84s -> 1802.99s]  Envoy what matches more with you guys envoy is very is much more dripped out
[1803.63s -> 1809.07s]  Like wind walker is like a fantasy character, right? We're dogs wearing balenciaga, which has nothing to do with fantasy, right?
[1812.91s -> 1819.02s]  All right. So i'm gonna put another thousand v bucks in my man. I should have just bought the other one
[1820.20s -> 1826.43s]  Wait, can you not get the how much is the the dog?
[1827.07s -> 1831.47s]  For me, it says 600 but maybe it's because already I don't know. Um, dude
[1831.55s -> 1835.71s]  I missed the I missed the 12 extra coins too for me. The dog says 1200
[1836.03s -> 1842.70s]  Okay, maybe that just like upgrades the dog. I think it's because okay. I see. It's like a I see
[1843.60s -> 1848.99s]  Because I own some of it. It's less. Yeah, I got the pack. So it doesn't even show me the um, the price anymore
[1850.72s -> 1855.44s]  Okay, I got two I got two thousand v bucks. You don't want to put that skin on before the match starts
[1855.44s -> 1860.83s]  Which is in like a minute. So you want to click locker in the top? Okay, but when you buy it
[1861.40s -> 1867.95s]  Oh you oh after you buy they already bought it my bad big chungus. That's what I was thinking is is really your style
[1868.51s -> 1873.16s]  Because he looks like the attack on time guy like he looks like he has like guys screaming
[1873.56s -> 1875.56s]  That would look great on you
[1876.28s -> 1878.72s]  Fuck it up germa. How do I claim this?
[1878.72s -> 1885.66s]  Wait, I think I think it's starting right now. You might be fucked. He's got it equipped. Did I do it? We're in
[1886.14s -> 1895.64s]  Did I equip it? All right, let's fucking go. This is not gonna be close. That's what i've been saying. I think I got it

[1913.98s -> 1918.06s]  And so what what that means for me is I want you to feel comfortable making shot calls
[1920.30s -> 1925.72s]  And we will we will follow you as if you are a compass command cavern. We should drop like right now
[1926.14s -> 1931.26s]  All right dropping. Okay, it's spacebar germa because I know all right, we need to fight for the blimp
[1931.26s -> 1936.89s]  There's gonna be people here. So try and grab a gun immediately and take control of them

[1943.74s -> 1950.03s]  They're not real characters, but they can uh, they can dice you up. It doesn't look like we have too many people here with us
[1950.35s -> 1958.48s]  Nice. There's one other at least one other player for sure
[1975.45s -> 1977.45s]  Guys how do I land?

[2087.55s -> 2091.07s]  Okay, jeremy jeremy we're restarting that game didn't count we got really lucky. Oh, wow
[2091.87s -> 2095.47s]  Return to love it. Okay. I did not know that fucking guy was gonna be there
[2096.89s -> 2100.81s]  Yeah, we had to we dealt with the npc and then we got run up on yeah
[2101.93s -> 2103.93s]  Okay, someone in tarik's team is really bad
[2104.25s -> 2108.44s]  I don't know who it was. I saw I don't know who it was but they were like, yeah, they were really good
[2108.68s -> 2112.44s]  Oh, that was probably slicker. Oh, we know that's not on their team. Wait, who's their new player?
[2112.76s -> 2115.50s]  So that was an npc we were fighting
[2115.58s -> 2120.54s]  The teleporting person really the really powerful guy was an npc, but then a real team dropped on our blimp
[2121.10s -> 2123.18s]  Oh crap, there's a new there's a new code now
[2124.01s -> 2129.45s]  Okay, i'll put that in
[2131.26s -> 2136.06s]  I was unlucky that we just randomly got put off the spawn next to those guys. Holy shit. Yeah
[2137.18s -> 2138.46s]  once they like
[2138.46s -> 2141.90s]  Once tarik and I don't even know who else got in there. They just annihilated us
[2142.06s -> 2147.58s]  Maybe it's better to fly or go to like a further blimp only because like really confident players like them are just going to insta drop
[2148.14s -> 2152.86s]  Yeah, I didn't I wanted I chose that one because I didn't see other like the ones that were further
[2152.94s -> 2157.02s]  All the ones I saw were tilted and what's the other crossroad one whatever it's called
[2157.26s -> 2162.06s]  Yeah, and I know that puns's team was gonna go for one of those two and I didn't want to fight puns. Oh fair enough
[2162.86s -> 2172.01s]  You got a new code in did you get the new code in nick? Uh, yeah. Yeah, I I read it up. All right ready
[2172.01s -> 2177.66s]  Uh, jeremy got ready up. Oh, yeah, my bad. It's only four games instead of five
[2177.98s -> 2183.10s]  So local bars is bad documented. So that might be the person on tarix. Why did why would restarting what happened?
[2184.16s -> 2187.20s]  Uh, I don't know there must have been some error and then we also lost time
[2187.28s -> 2189.68s]  So now there's only four matches instead of five. Oh, okay
[2190.08s -> 2196.89s]  So I think I have enough to buy one dance this time. Oh, that's so big. That is so big that helps
[2199.21s -> 2204.51s]  How about no sweat test it out? See how you like it? Sure
[2206.32s -> 2213.44s]  Whatever dude, I can't get the the gamer rage wanting. Oh my god my shop refresh. That's crazy
[2213.76s -> 2216.06s]  Because it looked a lot like this. So no head
[2217.90s -> 2219.66s]  That's not the right one
[2219.66s -> 2232.01s]  I know that's the default dance. Oh, yes, sir. Good luck slime. Thank you protect saikuno from guns insane name to have in chat
[2232.64s -> 2239.68s]  But also I agree. Why did your guy only use one hand for that dance? Is that a thing? I think that's the dance
[2244.97s -> 2246.41s]  That one just tilts me
[2246.41s -> 2251.53s]  Yeah, I just get mad looking at it. Just know after I kill someone I will be popping this. Yeah
[2252.57s -> 2254.57s]  I'm right there with you
[2256.92s -> 2258.92s]  Do
[2266.04s -> 2268.04s]  The one-handed floss
[2268.44s -> 2279.29s]  So I so badly want to do this at one of the fortnight concerts. Wait, is it okay? No, that's it's the code
[2279.29s -> 2287.48s]  We're already on. Okay, someone's a tarik scene thought we were randoms. Why would they think that that's weird to think
[2287.56s -> 2293.72s]  Why would you think royale come in my way is anyone but german 95? That's such a bot name
[2293.72s -> 2295.72s]  Randoms
[2298.92s -> 2301.08s]  Swag is for men
[2301.08s -> 2306.64s]  Yeah, these do at least a couple of these feel like bot names. I'll have a papa for sure
[2307.55s -> 2312.46s]  Pan i've had i've had this day since season two. Is it pen is the is the
[2313.02s -> 2315.60s]  It's just supposed to be pandas, but like pandas is taken
[2316.08s -> 2318.32s]  I got it. So I just was like
[2318.40s -> 2321.84s]  Till then it does it does mess with the brain a bit because you want to say pan
[2322.64s -> 2326.40s]  Does pan does a human mouth doesn't allow for that
[2328.00s -> 2332.46s]  Some people saying they can get thanos. Yeah thanos in the game
[2332.94s -> 2335.74s]  Thor dude, no shit will smith is in this game
[2335.90s -> 2340.46s]  Uh, I think moist had it on last week right after the the oscar's thing
[2340.86s -> 2343.74s]  It was really funny to see will smith jumping around but
[2344.54s -> 2350.48s]  I wouldn't have picked like the saturday morning cartoon bane if I knew that I could get thanos
[2351.90s -> 2357.90s]  Yeah, that's the thing you got to tune in next shop to see what what the vbucks you can spend you know
[2358.06s -> 2363.61s]  That's how they get you. Oh, so you can't just go back into the catalog and buy a bunch of stuff that they did
[2364.57s -> 2370.32s]  Yeah, I guess that adds exclusivity to it, right in a way
[2372.28s -> 2377.16s]  Do you guys think that um, what are your thoughts on the three stooges making their appearance here in the next few weeks?
[2379.20s -> 2383.12s]  I think that it's a game where four people can squad up. So there's an instant problem
[2384.83s -> 2390.81s]  Wow, that's true. Unless there was a fourth stooge like the bonus jonas
[2391.13s -> 2404.32s]  Well, what about mo or curly or something? You think that they have a chance with the bowl cut maybe yeah shemp
[2405.68s -> 2407.68s]  Everyone should have to play as the beetles
[2409.66s -> 2415.26s]  Oh shit, the beetles could be added. No, that's fucked up because two of them two of them were murdered bro. You can't do that
[2416.22s -> 2418.30s]  You literally can't all right. Here we go. Here we go
[2423.85s -> 2429.21s]  By the way, Anthony paul mccartney is a fig if the three stooges are the three stooges are not added to this game
[2429.29s -> 2431.77s]  By april 23rd, I believe I have to eat a glove on stream
[2432.49s -> 2438.41s]  That is a that is so unfortunate like a latex glove or like a mechanic
[2438.65s -> 2442.41s]  I mean, I I was so confident like two years ago. I gave a random date in the future
[2443.63s -> 2445.55s]  You know, I have a friend that did the same thing
[2445.55s -> 2450.19s]  He he said at the beginning of 2018. Dr. Phil will die this year and he didn't
[2450.59s -> 2457.69s]  So kind of kind of ate his own words on that one. What do you mean go here? Um, let's see
[2458.49s -> 2460.49s]  Maybe we can crank whatever this is
[2461.56s -> 2464.12s]  Yeah, i'm done. I'll be late. Yeah, let's do it
[2464.68s -> 2465.87s]  Yep
[2465.87s -> 2470.46s]  I think the later too the more safe we get well, I don't know
[2471.10s -> 2474.38s]  I think everyone I think everyone is thinking that so it's kind of a toss-up
[2475.34s -> 2477.98s]  I do like this spot though. I think I think we can do a lot of good work
[2478.14s -> 2480.14s]  We can see there's a lot of people dropping right now
[2481.28s -> 2483.28s]  So we're waiting we're waiting to get all the way to the end here
[2483.84s -> 2487.68s]  Yeah, drop drop when it says like 900 on the meters away from the ping. Oh
[2488.56s -> 2495.10s]  I guess you could like maybe now. Yeah, i'm gonna go now. I don't really see too many people so
[2495.90s -> 2497.10s]  Looks good
[2497.10s -> 2499.96s]  What's the best way to make it so I go over there and not across the whole game?
[2501.52s -> 2502.80s]  um
[2502.80s -> 2506.96s]  I don't exactly know what you're saying. You can you can pop your thing early by pressing space bar
[2507.12s -> 2509.12s]  Okay, if you don't want to go too low. Yeah
[2509.92s -> 2512.32s]  Which should be fine for where we're dropping because you want to be higher
[2514.70s -> 2516.70s]  I think we're good. I don't think anyone's dropping here
[2517.80s -> 2520.12s]  We might be able to loot the town under us too and then come back up
[2520.20s -> 2523.24s]  This actually looks really good and there's gonna be cars in this town. So we don't have to worry about circle
[2528.33s -> 2529.85s]  Oh, there's one person
[2529.85s -> 2531.37s]  So it's probably one team
[2531.37s -> 2533.21s]  So we're going into the blimp
[2533.21s -> 2536.97s]  Yeah, they missed the blimp. They're gonna go they're gonna. Oh, no, they made it they're going inside right now
[2538.25s -> 2540.25s]  I'm bad. I'm bad. I'm bad. I'm bad. I'm bad. I'm so sorry
[2542.03s -> 2546.11s]  I I picked I hit a pixel. Did you fall? Yeah, I fell i'll come down
[2547.07s -> 2550.01s]  I'm so sorry
[2551.69s -> 2555.34s]  They're inside
[2555.42s -> 2557.10s]  I'm gonna revive nick and come right back up
[2557.10s -> 2560.30s]  It might be worth to actually bail on the blimp because we have two down here
[2560.38s -> 2562.70s]  Yeah, there's one on top of right now if I jump off my safe
[2565.05s -> 2568.97s]  If you if you jump off you can you'll take the ball down we might have to just like hit the town
[2572.81s -> 2576.97s]  Right in front of me
[2579.45s -> 2581.45s]  I'm going for a gun
[2583.29s -> 2585.47s]  Right there shit
[2588.99s -> 2593.07s]  Okay, fuck we're actually just only play that was mendo xqc
[2594.76s -> 2596.76s]  Holy shit, we're playing the best game right now
[2597.24s -> 2602.84s]  Dude, i've never played one minute of this game. Okay. I don't even I don't know how to land the fucking sky dive
[2604.16s -> 2606.16s]  Uh, that was that wasn't bad
[2606.16s -> 2611.72s]  Ludwig, what are you doing in the call? Oh, sorry. Sorry. Just spectating. What do you want? Ludwig?
[2611.96s -> 2613.96s]  I'll do what you guys are doing spectating
[2614.70s -> 2618.88s]  I don't like this guy anyone else sort of sharing that feeling
[2619.36s -> 2626.27s]  Did did you think it's fair that tarik is playing this video game? Oh, he must be gone. Oh, he's gone
[2626.27s -> 2629.68s]  Yeah, he left. So what happened there?
[2630.62s -> 2637.18s]  Um, okay, I trolled, uh, my my character's foot hit like a pixel which made me insta drop off my
[2637.74s -> 2640.73s]  Parasail and then I just went straight down. Oh shit
[2641.29s -> 2646.09s]  And then we dropped with maybe the best team in the lobby at the moment. Oh
[2648.86s -> 2654.54s]  People going for blimps. Are we uh screwing ourselves by going blimp? We might have to we might have to
[2657.79s -> 2659.64s]  With that with an audible
[2659.64s -> 2663.16s]  That's fine. What I think what is in the blimp? That's very important
[2663.56s -> 2666.44s]  It's less about what's in there and it's more that you have high ground constantly
[2666.52s -> 2670.12s]  Okay, and and teams like the whole goal is just to live the longest, right?
[2670.20s -> 2673.80s]  So if you can like have a really high spot where it's hard for people to kill you
[2674.78s -> 2682.28s]  Uh then and also be in a place where people don't often like try to take over late then it's just good
[2682.52s -> 2691.45s]  This person's in a tent. No, dude, if they're tenting i'm not a narc. I would never oh wait
[2692.17s -> 2694.17s]  Wait, what happened?
[2695.13s -> 2702.41s]  Wait, maybe you're maybe you're allowed to tent to heal but not to store
[2702.81s -> 2708.56s]  I think we ran into some bad luck boys and I think it's it's no it's no big deal
[2709.04s -> 2710.08s]  i'm telling you
[2710.08s -> 2712.56s]  Just give me a weapon and I and I and i'll shine
[2715.18s -> 2717.34s]  I don't think I haven't held a weapon either one of these two
[2718.46s -> 2721.58s]  Dude shroudy shroud is just literally melting. No
[2722.14s -> 2724.24s]  He took out mango's team single-handedly
[2725.10s -> 2736.59s]  He's the he is god's gift to all of gaming and he's in the same tournament moki got tarik. Okay, good to know
[2739.39s -> 2746.19s]  Scalps. Dr. Lupo is he's good, right? Dr. Lupo is I believe a very seasoned player very good, right?
[2746.91s -> 2749.92s]  I feel like this is the one to watch at the moment
[2753.29s -> 2757.29s]  Sakuno's team is a is a powerhouse of content tarik got rebooted
[2757.93s -> 2768.75s]  But you can get in that thing
[2768.75s -> 2770.75s]  Yeah, you can like launch yourself
[2772.81s -> 2775.13s]  I didn't know you could gonzo the great out of that. I would have just done that
[2777.15s -> 2779.15s]  What would you call it gonzo the great?
[2779.95s -> 2787.96s]  Yeah, okay
[2787.96s -> 2789.24s]  Whoa, that's cool
[2789.24s -> 2791.61s]  It's inside the mind of sakuno right now
[2794.17s -> 2797.21s]  Dude dodger lupo's fortnight level 153
[2798.09s -> 2802.57s]  Oh shit
[2802.57s -> 2805.29s]  Guys, it's too late to get a vape pen. I can't do it right now
[2812.43s -> 2814.91s]  Yeah, blimps seem to be what everyone is trying to do
[2815.55s -> 2817.21s]  Yeah
[2817.21s -> 2818.81s]  I think we should avoid blimps
[2818.81s -> 2821.69s]  What's another good place to to hang out?
[2824.27s -> 2827.47s]  I'm behind i'm not sure. I think it's just about like, uh
[2828.19s -> 2834.51s]  It's kind of lucky right because like you could say like oh drop far away, but then other teams are also saying drop far away
[2835.39s -> 2840.67s]  We're really just trying to set ourselves up with like enough gear and decent positions so that we don't have to worry about looting
[2841.23s -> 2843.60s]  If we can just get live off the spawn
[2843.60s -> 2846.80s]  We can it'll help us a lot
[2846.80s -> 2848.80s]  Yeah, just on's like just the most it's just coin
[2849.76s -> 2850.64s]  Yeah
[2850.64s -> 2853.60s]  Guys, i'm not gonna order a vape pen off of uber eats
[2854.56s -> 2857.13s]  That would be the stupidest fucking thing ever
[2860.28s -> 2861.80s]  uber eats
[2862.89s -> 2866.41s]  No, i'm not vaping a vape pet. I'm not gonna inhale nicotine for fun
[2870.03s -> 2873.95s]  The place is the very end but people who drop before the autodrop will just get there first
[2875.04s -> 2877.68s]  So if we want to go to the end, let's just drop before the end, you know
[2878.24s -> 2879.80s]  Yeah
[2879.80s -> 2884.04s]  I mean like how much are you craving like nicotine where you need to uber eat?
[2884.68s -> 2892.64s]  Why is there a car over there? This is just like a there's just like a regular red sedan just parked on a hill
[2893.60s -> 2898.56s]  Yeah, there's just some car ass cars in this game and then there's like lambos with jet rockets
[2901.07s -> 2903.07s]  Wait, there are people
[2907.04s -> 2909.04s]  That was that was a good that was a good shot
[2910.60s -> 2912.60s]  Watching a tubbo right now
[2912.60s -> 2916.44s]  How do you switch teams? You're watching. Oh, you just keep pressing next. Yeah, he's gonna keep going
[2920.73s -> 2926.86s]  I'm trying to learn as I watch
[2926.86s -> 2929.18s]  All the teams are just like trying to get as high as possible
[2929.90s -> 2934.38s]  For one second. I thought that was like a cars crossover and there was a car's skin. That was like lightning mcqueen
[2936.06s -> 2938.06s]  the price that's oh, I just turned to a
[2938.54s -> 2946.92s]  Ooh ipn and it's chun li from street fighter with the dump truck tubbo is bruno mars
[2947.64s -> 2953.28s]  Shit
[2953.28s -> 2956.48s]  I bet epic could just make celebrity deathmatch with all the ip they own
[2957.20s -> 2960.80s]  Or like have access to licensing too. So this squad is all still up
[2961.84s -> 2963.98s]  which is the
[2963.98s -> 2967.18s]  Crash yawn disguise toast. Oh, no, somebody's dead
[2967.74s -> 2969.74s]  Crashing just died. Oh, no, no questions right here
[2970.92s -> 2975.56s]  Yeah, uh the the health bar is like really bugged sometimes it'll just show people are dead when they're not
[2975.88s -> 2978.12s]  I feel like i'm stuck in between two teams
[2979.00s -> 2982.12s]  Yeah, i've had that happen to me. That's why I was asking like how do you switch teams?
[2982.92s -> 2986.28s]  But I just kept pressing next player and eventually I got out of the ken jutsu
[2987.32s -> 2990.36s]  I I don't I don't care about the flavored vape pens. I'm not gonna
[2991.00s -> 2994.68s]  Eat like inhale like apple cinnamon nicotine. No, I don't want to do that
[2995.24s -> 3003.76s]  Is there a way to see the list of yo, guess what you shouldn't either
[3005.37s -> 3008.72s]  You shouldn't even know what that is
[3008.72s -> 3012.08s]  You shouldn't even know what that is. You're not old enough to know what that is. I'm playing fortnight today
[3018.68s -> 3020.76s]  Yeah, i'm stuck in the tier zoo team now
[3021.48s -> 3026.03s]  Yeah, I said that you're spectating me now. I'm just gonna i'm just gonna sit here
[3027.52s -> 3031.12s]  Enjoy the view while I can I hate being like trying to switch out
[3036.04s -> 3038.44s]  Oh my god, every team is trying so hard. Holy shit
[3039.88s -> 3047.58s]  This is great. The tier zoos team is just in bushes at the edge of the map the very very edge daily doses bad, man
[3050.00s -> 3053.60s]  So you kind of just want to grab you want to get a bunch of items get a spot
[3054.00s -> 3057.84s]  And just kind of defend that spot till the circle that starts to kind of encroach on you, right?
[3058.32s -> 3059.44s]  Yeah
[3059.44s -> 3062.88s]  you also kind of want to play to kill people though like I think I think like the way that the
[3063.12s -> 3065.84s]  the team like tier zoos team is playing whether there's play on the edge of the map like
[3066.72s -> 3071.52s]  Best case scenario they get to like the final couple teams and they're in like a pretty bad position
[3072.08s -> 3074.08s]  And then they like maybe they probably die
[3074.80s -> 3079.04s]  And you get points for every kill your team has. Oh, okay. So you do
[3080.16s -> 3082.72s]  So you get like a certain amount of points for like placing top three
[3083.28s -> 3089.44s]  But you every kill you get also adds on top of that. So like you do have some level of pressure to be aggressive
[3089.84s -> 3094.64s]  Okay, which is why being somewhat central and being high up is good because then you get to see people trying to rotate
[3095.60s -> 3100.24s]  Uh, but you're also in like a good spot looking at uh, justin minx's team looks like it's going down here
[3102.28s -> 3104.49s]  Uh-oh
[3104.49s -> 3106.41s]  Oh, this is trouble
[3106.41s -> 3108.41s]  This is a lot of trouble
[3112.44s -> 3113.40s]  Oh
[3113.40s -> 3115.36s]  Not quite
[3115.36s -> 3117.60s]  Oh thermal is so busted man
[3123.08s -> 3126.43s]  so this is uh
[3126.43s -> 3129.44s]  I'm very invested
[3129.44s -> 3134.44s]  It's a good team right here. Who's anonymous 257. I want to know who that is. Yeah, I was wondering that too
[3134.52s -> 3139.24s]  Actually, we can look at this. Yeah, it's not it's not looking it's it's probably shra and actually, I don't know
[3144.83s -> 3146.83s]  That team is lily. It's lily
[3147.47s -> 3151.79s]  Is it lily? I don't hate fortnight. I just don't understand fortnight
[3165.45s -> 3171.04s]  So how many squads are still up? Uh, well, there's 40 people
[3171.84s -> 3176.38s]  But it doesn't say the team amount there's a big fight going on with timmy's team
[3184.52s -> 3188.14s]  I feel like i'm playing against like professional soccer players in a game of football
[3190.20s -> 3192.20s]  And I like am a video gamer
[3195.21s -> 3201.37s]  Oh my god, it's like when one of those celebrity athletes comes to your school to visit, uh, and you're like an elementary school
[3202.33s -> 3206.97s]  And they're just like giant giant mountains of humans and you're like damn and then it's oh we're gonna play
[3207.05s -> 3211.13s]  We're gonna play some uh baseball together and they just hit like five home runs and everybody cheers
[3221.04s -> 3226.91s]  Well, they're reviving holy shit dude alec, uh
[3227.95s -> 3230.43s]  My friend who got taken off our team his team is just destroyed
[3232.84s -> 3236.28s]  Happy for him. Um, I am happy for it was actually it's actually either you or him
[3236.76s -> 3238.76s]  What is going on over here, by the way?
[3239.61s -> 3241.61s]  It takes a long time to revive somebody does it?
[3243.13s -> 3247.21s]  Yeah, it takes 10 seconds, but you can double up you can like cut it in half if two people revive
[3247.37s -> 3249.37s]  Why was she just spray painting herself in the face
[3250.33s -> 3254.81s]  Uh, it's a heal. Oh, okay. Yeah, it heals you like 15 every like
[3256.17s -> 3258.17s]  Something every like half a second
[3258.73s -> 3260.73s]  That was oh

[3263.50s -> 3268.99s]  It's like the whole team
[3268.99s -> 3270.75s]  Who is prospering?

[3275.00s -> 3280.25s]  Oh, he's right behind the team. This team doesn't see him

[3295.42s -> 3298.17s]  Please tell me this is fake
[3298.33s -> 3301.37s]  I can assure you it's real but I can tell you it's a few days late
[3303.20s -> 3305.20s]  And I don't have the fake pen, but whatever
[3305.28s -> 3308.00s]  I'm just playing for it. I'm not kidding. I'm playing for it and i'm not kidding
[3314.48s -> 3317.36s]  I'm watching shroud and he's not he's not thirsting at all
[3318.89s -> 3322.09s]  He downs him and he moves on to the next chump. Yeah honorable gamer
[3322.65s -> 3325.88s]  It's xqc doing
[3325.88s -> 3328.20s]  He watched them to get revived so you can put them back down

[3345.55s -> 3347.55s]  That was that was crazy
[3353.69s -> 3356.81s]  Tuber reaction. I gotta do something man was watching tv
[3360.51s -> 3365.15s]  Who's the shark who has the shark skin? It's just an actual shark in the game
[3366.27s -> 3368.57s]  It's like what the fuck is this?
[3369.53s -> 3374.01s]  Yeah, this game is terrible because they weren't doing anything I was like why are they not attacking this person
[3374.73s -> 3380.17s]  I thought it was like a transformation where he did like getting so oh my god. Yeah, dude
[3381.21s -> 3385.55s]  He's nuts
[3385.55s -> 3390.27s]  Dude, lovely wouldn't let our friend's little brother play because he's good at fortnight, but he let shroud in the tournament
[3390.43s -> 3392.43s]  Oh, like fucked up bro
[3393.79s -> 3396.83s]  Okay, he's down what shrouds is what shrouds name
[3397.55s -> 3400.35s]  Trouty rowdy rowdy. Oh my god. What can I not?
[3401.74s -> 3405.10s]  Oh, he just he literally just died. Oh, okay. The rest of his team is up
[3406.14s -> 3412.75s]  Huns is just big chilling. This is batman
[3414.03s -> 3422.08s]  Oh nade shots down. Is this the end of the team? Oh, they're rezzing. They got nade up. He has a med kit
[3424.32s -> 3434.78s]  Uh, did they where stream 2022? You can't say that yet. It's not over. He chowed with his level one account
[3435.50s -> 3439.77s]  Just vibing. Oh, whoever they're fighting right now is just so dead
[3440.49s -> 3450.59s]  What am I gonna add to make it better bro, I just told you we were doing tier lists after this
[3450.59s -> 3453.31s]  This is not gonna last that this is only gonna be like another like half hour 40 minutes
[3458.91s -> 3461.79s]  Do you guys see puns? He's just been hiding. Yeah
[3466.35s -> 3472.43s]  That is so smart, I almost just call this guy han solo what's bubblefets in the game?
[3474.14s -> 3476.46s]  Yeah, I think so. I think they just yeah, they just saw her stuff
[3477.50s -> 3482.70s]  That's kind of cool. All right daily doses team. It's wiped. Wait puns can win this
[3483.50s -> 3488.94s]  Oh, he fucked up. Oh tarik's the only one left on this team, I think unless the health bars are glitched while these whole teams is up
[3494.41s -> 3495.93s]  Oh
[3495.93s -> 3505.79s]  They should rush they should rush the nade team
[3508.30s -> 3510.30s]  Wait, is it one v one? No
[3512.06s -> 3515.96s]  I'm not gonna do a vape flavor tier list. I don't know what it even tastes like
[3516.44s -> 3522.36s]  It's probably probably tastes like ass. All right, so they're all going at f. They're like, oh my god. He like fifth partied
[3522.84s -> 3524.84s]  Oh, it's a four v one
[3527.21s -> 3528.78s]  Oh
[3528.78s -> 3531.18s]  What shot? Oh, that's toast toast to the last
[3532.35s -> 3536.11s]  Wait that oh, I was just on bubby's um pov and then I went right to do this when he headshot him
[3536.43s -> 3538.43s]  Anthony alex in the final team
[3538.51s -> 3540.51s]  That is crazy
[3541.58s -> 3543.58s]  Let's get evolved. Oh, that's
[3547.96s -> 3549.96s]  Okay, wow
[3552.14s -> 3555.69s]  All right rough start but
[3555.69s -> 3560.43s]  I think frost was prospering guys pretty good. I think we'll be all right this time
[3561.23s -> 3568.35s]  With the last first one didn't count second one. We just got unlucky like everybody went there and I was still figuring out how to detach the parachute
[3568.99s -> 3571.39s]  Um, I know how to do that. I know how to detach the parachute now
[3571.47s -> 3573.47s]  I think we're in a better position than we were before
[3573.95s -> 3578.27s]  We got it now. I'm optimistic. You know what they say jerma. You gotta be down to come back
[3579.84s -> 3582.01s]  Yeah
[3582.01s -> 3587.42s]  Also, you only ever win or learn that's a good way to put it. I learned so much
[3588.06s -> 3590.54s]  Just now watching that whole game the entire game
[3591.90s -> 3594.20s]  Is
[3595.16s -> 3600.52s]  They're predicting a lot of strats I actually got the most perspective because I got to watch every player who wasn't me
[3602.68s -> 3610.11s]  Why is it headshotting everybody? Okay. Let's get this second code going
[3610.75s -> 3611.87s]  Oh, man
[3611.87s -> 3613.15s]  I have to leave
[3613.15s -> 3618.68s]  I'll be right back. Wait, what happened? How do I get out of here?
[3619.64s -> 3621.64s]  uh top left
[3621.64s -> 3625.80s]  Or escape key maybe and then oh just bottom left is maybe a cancel bottom left. Yeah
[3629.52s -> 3632.08s]  Someone said we're not last which is kind of hype
[3632.72s -> 3636.89s]  No, we are we finished 19th. There's 19 teams. I'm banning that guy
[3639.23s -> 3646.54s]  Easy, so there's 19 teams. We came in 19th place. Yeah, I think we we got well, we got really unlucky. We really did
[3648.14s -> 3652.86s]  It's not over. I wish there was still five matches but
[3656.30s -> 3659.50s]  People in my chat are voting to see if we're gonna win the next round
[3661.29s -> 3662.49s]  um
[3662.49s -> 3666.09s]  It's not a it's not a uh straight bet. What would you say they go?
[3666.17s -> 3670.25s]  What if you were taking odds on this? What's the odds that we come in first place next next game?
[3670.73s -> 3671.93s]  one in 19
[3671.93s -> 3673.93s]  No
[3673.93s -> 3675.45s]  19
[3675.45s -> 3677.45s]  I think it's 100 percent
[3677.45s -> 3681.85s]  Yeah, 100 percent. I'm on the 100 percent. We're winning this one. We got unlucky like
[3682.49s -> 3684.49s]  Yeah, I think the payout would be like
[3685.19s -> 3687.95s]  6000 to one
[3687.95s -> 3689.95s]  If you would have bet on us right now
[3689.95s -> 3693.69s]  Are the odds that's hype. Yeah, somebody could make a lot of money
[3693.93s -> 3706.76s]  I just feel like the results of the last match were indicative of our team's overall skill. Mm-hmm or
[3707.30s -> 3709.30s]  Connectiveness or
[3709.40s -> 3713.88s]  Chemistry. Yeah, I think I think I think we should stay away from blimps because blimps are a little confusing
[3714.44s -> 3719.88s]  They're like genuinely confusing to navigate on the inside and get to and get up and down and we can just go to like
[3720.70s -> 3722.70s]  Just some town and loot up, you know
[3723.26s -> 3726.06s]  Also want to make sure I get because I don't want to be a moron when we start this
[3726.46s -> 3728.49s]  If one of you guys goes down
[3728.49s -> 3733.21s]  Is is it you know you get to a position where you can like a left for dead revive somebody, right?
[3733.21s -> 3736.25s]  Just like e hold e tap. Yeah, you hold it. You hold it. Okay
[3736.33s -> 3740.73s]  Yeah, and you can't you can't move around like physically while doing it. You have to just stay still
[3741.13s -> 3757.53s]  Okay, you're kind of using your your positional currency by rising. This is cool regardless
[3759.74s -> 3765.85s]  No, it's only cool if we win. I was gonna wait till we won and then we could
[3766.65s -> 3769.85s]  Say this is only fun because we won
[3781.44s -> 3783.44s]  Not now
[3783.52s -> 3788.06s]  It's just unlucky we got
[3788.06s -> 3793.02s]  Doing the we two teams that are like really really really good teams that have really good players
[3793.10s -> 3795.18s]  We ran into them back to back first second
[3795.18s -> 3801.02s]  It is crazy that we fought tarik's team and then we got a lucky reset and then we fought xqc's team
[3801.42s -> 3807.18s]  Yeah, I know right. I killed I killed someone on that blimp. I killed I don't know who they were like that's some weird name
[3809.05s -> 3810.73s]  I think it might have been
[3810.73s -> 3814.88s]  ipn
[3814.88s -> 3817.44s]  I wish I would have landed on the blimp dude if we would have killed that team
[3818.08s -> 3823.07s]  Um, it's so nice. Fuck the stream's not over yet
[3824.16s -> 3827.60s]  Oh, I can't wait. I can't wait for those worst dream 2022 andes
[3828.16s -> 3834.80s]  To wait till I do the full from software every single boss ever tier list because that's coming up and I want I want to
[3834.80s -> 3837.68s]  See your face when you see how fun that is
[3839.60s -> 3852.11s]  But I get cool backpacks i'm gonna buy something right now. You got me inspired hot bullet time is so swag
[3852.99s -> 3861.31s]  I'm i'm very confident. We'll at least
[3862.03s -> 3864.03s]  We will at least land this time
[3864.27s -> 3866.67s]  And at least congregate somewhere with weapons
[3868.03s -> 3879.66s]  Desert get you a rifle in your hand. I have fish sticks in the oven. Um
[3880.86s -> 3884.56s]  Man, let me ask you guys this in the call here. Yeah, so
[3885.90s -> 3888.30s]  You know how in the back of a lot of frozen foods?
[3889.28s -> 3891.21s]  it's like
[3891.21s -> 3895.29s]  50 plus minutes sometimes to heat up but it's like four minutes in the microwave
[3896.38s -> 3899.04s]  Yeah, how?
[3899.04s -> 3901.04s]  When do you guys decide to use the oven?
[3902.57s -> 3908.57s]  Can I tell you my my filthy little secret my my filthy little dirty secret I have sure
[3910.27s -> 3911.31s]  uh
[3911.31s -> 3919.45s]  I prefer microwaved food totally oven-made food. Yeah. Yeah, you're just like you're just like a sludge monster
[3919.61s -> 3922.89s]  It's because it's fast just because it's faster and you know, you can for me for me for me
[3922.89s -> 3927.29s]  It's because it's faster like I know no for me. It is taste. That's why I am a filthy monster
[3927.69s -> 3930.75s]  I actually think that how do I put this?
[3931.58s -> 3934.86s]  You know how like you know shit that you put in the oven in microwave
[3934.86s -> 3937.82s]  It's already like a certain quality threshold that it can't break through
[3938.51s -> 3944.96s]  Like it has a hard ceiling of how good it can be also game two's in the thing
[3945.61s -> 3950.01s]  I have the code in there and we're ready. We're ready. Yeah. Awesome
[3950.57s -> 3955.53s]  What's the last thing you guys ate that was a like a microwaved food or a frozen food?
[3956.17s -> 3957.29s]  Uh
[3957.29s -> 3963.69s]  Microwaving I I do microwave leftovers all the time. That's just simple. No, but like a packaged like disgusting trash meal
[3963.77s -> 3966.03s]  I had a uh
[3966.03s -> 3972.57s]  I had a di giorno pizza on my trip to arizona a couple weeks ago brotherhood. Yeah, that's all right
[3972.65s -> 3975.20s]  No, but I mean I I wouldn't put that in the microwave
[3975.28s -> 3981.68s]  I would never put would you ever put a chicken pot pie in the microwave? Yeah. Oh, come on. I used to eat those
[3981.68s -> 3983.68s]  That's why i'm only this tall
[3987.13s -> 3992.89s]  It's stunted your growth the frozen chicken pot pie has to go in the oven even it takes like an hour it has to
[3993.53s -> 3995.05s]  Yeah, maybe for you. I guess yeah
[3995.05s -> 3999.13s]  Maybe if you maybe you're free from the 50s and you and you hand crank your radio
[3999.53s -> 4002.41s]  Can you do it in black and white? Yeah, i'm fucking busy brother
[4004.33s -> 4007.61s]  All right, so what everyone what would you put it up? Oh god damn. I'm such a driver ready
[4008.49s -> 4010.49s]  It's always talking about chicken pot pies
[4010.97s -> 4013.13s]  Is that why they came somebody said they came to watch you stream?
[4013.13s -> 4019.18s]  We're just sitting here talking about frozen food and I didn't ready up yet. Sorry about the banter
[4019.76s -> 4026.33s]  Savnet, what's the last frozen food thing you ate? Dude, I actually don't remember you live healthy. Yeah, you're eating good
[4026.49s -> 4030.65s]  That's really good though. Let's be honest. I I have yeah, I I try to eat pretty good
[4030.73s -> 4034.25s]  Yeah, I don't I don't remember the last frozen food thing, but yeah, I really don't
[4034.57s -> 4038.25s]  I used to grind final fantasy 14 and just eat pop tarts all day in college
[4038.33s -> 4044.65s]  I think I just like 2 000 calories a day in pop tarts again. It's why my bones i'm sure are hollow like a bird's
[4048.01s -> 4052.96s]  I remember my first year of college. I'd yeah, I used to eat so much like yeah pop tarts and like
[4053.28s -> 4056.08s]  What's it called hot pockets and that type of stuff? I'd tear it up
[4057.55s -> 4066.86s]  You know what actually is good in the microwave is those trader joe's, uh tiki masalas those are unbelievable trader joe's
[4067.48s -> 4072.68s]  Constantly is blowing me away. That actually might be the best frozen food item that exists
[4073.16s -> 4084.41s]  Is the tiki masala from trader joe's like honest to god? It's it's there's nothing that compares frozen wise germa
[4084.41s -> 4088.89s]  Who is your best friend? Um
[4090.41s -> 4101.76s]  Uh burger boy. Wait, what was that burger boy? Are we getting owned burger boy these nuts in your mouth?
[4102.32s -> 4103.84s]  Whoa, hey
[4103.84s -> 4105.12s]  I don't know
[4105.12s -> 4108.16s]  I try to get ahead of it
[4108.16s -> 4112.96s]  Oh burger boy. Look, I don't have a best friend because I think that that's stupid because it called it
[4113.52s -> 4115.04s]  All of your other
[4115.04s -> 4117.76s]  All of your other friends then have to know oh that's your best friend
[4117.76s -> 4125.44s]  No, I have everyone's on the same playing field for me dibs. Well, we're not we're not there yet

[4133.76s -> 4136.88s]  It's a centrist position. Yeah, that person is correct
[4137.20s -> 4146.78s]  No, they are not because I don't have a best friend makes me a centrist. Yeah. Yes, sir. Mr. President, sir
[4149.77s -> 4152.68s]  Sapnap, who's your best friend? Um

[4156.75s -> 4163.28s]  That's fair like my with my group of like friends that i'm like really close with i'd probably be like dream george
[4164.00s -> 4165.76s]  carl quackety
[4165.76s -> 4171.20s]  It's a circle rather than like yeah, it's like a circle. It's not like yeah, you are incredibly well rounded
[4171.20s -> 4173.20s]  Can I just say like you're right?

[4384.99s -> 4387.34s]  Hey

[4393.50s -> 4403.10s]  Hey, good luck game three guys. Good luck game three
[4403.50s -> 4411.13s]  I just want to hold a weapon to watch the whole fucking game again. Oh my god, dude
[4412.44s -> 4414.44s]  I just I just want to know what it's like to shoot a weapon
[4415.00s -> 4416.20s]  I know
[4416.20s -> 4422.12s]  No, I I knew because like I ran downstairs like like in the mines and I was like destroying someone and I got
[4422.20s -> 4425.56s]  Two tapped by a deag and I was like damn whoever two tapped me with that deag is really good
[4426.12s -> 4428.60s]  And then I saw the fucking kill feed and I was like god damn it
[4429.72s -> 4434.20s]  Bro, okay. Now you can nominate for worst room
[4435.21s -> 4436.56s]  um
[4436.56s -> 4439.44s]  After that one because it'd be like what am I supposed to do about it?
[4439.76s -> 4444.43s]  What am I supposed to do?
[4444.43s -> 4449.07s]  Is that oh I land we land and which is dead. I I haven't even held a weapon yet
[4449.55s -> 4451.07s]  I don't even know what this is like
[4451.07s -> 4454.35s]  I don't know what the trajectory of moving your character feels like
[4455.08s -> 4458.60s]  Like I don't know what the the knots per second it is when you actually walk around
[4458.68s -> 4461.48s]  I don't think i've walked around. I think i've landed with the parachute
[4462.04s -> 4464.36s]  And died in five to ten seconds
[4465.48s -> 4468.11s]  Oh my god
[4468.11s -> 4472.75s]  I mean, it's funny, but I mean, I was just sure a lot of content going on for me
[4474.84s -> 4476.84s]  You know you want to come over zap nap
[4481.88s -> 4483.88s]  He's earned it honestly
[4484.20s -> 4486.20s]  He's had too good for too long
[4488.00s -> 4491.68s]  Yeah, I said I think i'm gonna surprise some people if I had a
[4492.56s -> 4496.32s]  I have had fucking minecraft axe in my hand
[4496.88s -> 4500.88s]  And i'm I don't know what like all these places are I haven't even held a weapon yet
[4501.20s -> 4504.00s]  If you put a weapon in my hand
[4504.00s -> 4508.88s]  But I like I was about to I was about to walk around the corner and melee swing at shroud
[4509.28s -> 4514.24s]  Do you understand like what out dire it is right now on this team? We just keep I
[4515.28s -> 4521.23s]  He would have thought I was a bot. He would have thought I was about this is path
[4522.59s -> 4524.59s]  So what if
[4524.59s -> 4531.55s]  Sorry, okay. What if we if there's a team we just fucking go away like we don't take the initial flight ever
[4531.79s -> 4534.59s]  Yeah, we loot first. We loot first no matter what even if we think the team's bad
[4536.48s -> 4542.64s]  So it's like if we see a team, uh, you know, we just mark a different spot overshoot or something like that
[4543.44s -> 4545.68s]  I think that's our best chance to get out of the yeah
[4545.68s -> 4550.32s]  Maybe we even maybe we even drop really high so that we have advantage on like where people are going
[4551.36s -> 4553.04s]  We can decide
[4553.04s -> 4561.50s]  We would we don't we don't need to hit the ground first if we're going somewhere. No one went
[4562.89s -> 4566.03s]  Oh, no daily dose
[4566.03s -> 4567.82s]  I love that guy
[4567.82s -> 4572.54s]  He's hiding he's trying not to die I hate that guy but I like his content so I should have done
[4573.95s -> 4575.39s]  You hate him because he's
[4575.39s -> 4578.59s]  Seating the game looks like he's trying to get him water. He's like water, please
[4579.31s -> 4582.70s]  I feel like he's gonna put his head in there and start shrinking
[4583.02s -> 4589.21s]  Someone said at least we're consistent and that is true and valid and right he's lost in the desert
[4591.26s -> 4592.56s]  Oh, no
[4592.56s -> 4596.49s]  Oh, no
[4596.49s -> 4598.49s]  What? Oh, they're on the same team. Okay

[4661.40s -> 4662.68s]  Finished first
[4662.68s -> 4665.93s]  I think he had it like that

[4968.72s -> 4970.32s]  germa
[4970.40s -> 4980.38s]  Oh this guy's a leather banana
[4980.38s -> 5014.99s]  I don't like that. I don't like even it being called that sexual you play you play minecraft, right tap nap
[5015.39s -> 5016.46s]  Yeah
[5016.46s -> 5019.90s]  Do you do you still enjoy it these days as much as you used to when you got into it?
[5020.66s -> 5026.82s]  Um, I think now these days it's i'm much more relying on like I need to be playing with like my friends before
[5027.22s -> 5034.16s]  I used to like sweat minecraft. I was just playing just to be like good. So now it's more social
[5034.56s -> 5038.08s]  Yeah, it's like if your friends don't want to play you're probably not playing. Yeah, exactly
[5038.56s -> 5043.62s]  Oh shit, that's why I don't play csgo. We're the same. Oh god. I played so much csgo
[5045.65s -> 5049.57s]  All my friends switched to valorant and I was like, I can't I guess i'm playing valorant now, which is fine
[5049.89s -> 5053.26s]  But I missed the ak-47
[5053.42s -> 5057.95s]  Yeah, I just miss cracking cases. Honestly, that's
[5058.91s -> 5063.39s]  If they would just put opening cases in valorant, I would I would have nothing left in counter-strike. I'm in
[5064.27s -> 5069.17s]  Okay, i'm back. I just I like counter-strike's movement got a little trick for you here
[5069.33s -> 5074.50s]  You'd like to see it feels like a little clunky, but valorant. I actually enjoy valorant more
[5075.36s -> 5082.72s]  Like just a quick one. Yeah, I I agree with that. I think uh, pretty much like I think that I like that counter-strike
[5082.88s -> 5089.92s]  Rewards you for being good at b-hopping. My hands are so greasy instead of making b-hopping and like not a thing. Yeah
[5090.64s -> 5092.80s]  I also think that they made a counter-strafing
[5094.19s -> 5097.79s]  Not a thing. So yeah counter-strafing is like it's like bad like you can't there's no
[5098.85s -> 5101.25s]  there's no jiggle peeking right i'm like in csgo like
[5101.89s -> 5103.89s]  like you can jiggle peek a corner and just like
[5104.29s -> 5106.77s]  tap heads and valorant it's not as
[5107.65s -> 5113.33s]  Yeah, and valorant you can just let go of the movement key and it you're accurate the same speed as if you counter-strike
[5113.33s -> 5117.73s]  Yeah, when I jiggle in valorant, I feel like i'm getting made fun of like in a discord or somewhere
[5119.54s -> 5123.22s]  Look at this guy. What is what is what do you think he's doing? He's playing the wrong game
[5126.53s -> 5133.81s]  You play valorant a lot slap sap amp. Yeah, I do. What's your rank diamond three diamond? Oh, he's a gamer
[5134.29s -> 5137.90s]  Yes, sir. Me too. I'm also that i'm actually immortal
[5138.44s -> 5139.74s]  20 20
[5139.82s -> 5145.95s]  26 we should play I think I think I was d3 at the end of the season and I think i'm d2 right now
[5145.95s -> 5149.71s]  I haven't played much. I haven't been home for like the whole entire last month
[5150.35s -> 5153.79s]  We can get our we can get our ego up after this play some valorant. Yeah
[5154.83s -> 5156.19s]  All right, guys
[5156.19s -> 5161.47s]  That's a game I win at I'd like for you guys to make it just a quick quick u-turn over to my stream for a second
[5161.87s -> 5165.55s]  Yeah, I knew that get it open. It's cracking. Let's see
[5166.27s -> 5172.62s]  I'd like to show you I've got two hands here holding a penny you can see
[5174.00s -> 5176.32s]  This hand is nothing in it. Let's just go and make sure there's no strings there
[5178.38s -> 5180.86s]  No strings. Yeah, i'm on i'm on you i'm on no strings at all
[5181.81s -> 5185.17s]  And if we could turn that penny be nice if we could turn that into 50 cents, wouldn't it?
[5185.57s -> 5192.27s]  That'd be pretty cool. You know turn that into 50 cents, wouldn't it? Oh shit
[5192.83s -> 5194.75s]  That's kind of clean
[5194.75s -> 5198.51s]  50x yeah, that's a 50x 50x on on
[5200.03s -> 5202.03s]  Whoa on might of raw
[5206.66s -> 5210.62s]  My stream sucks
[5211.18s -> 5217.34s]  Yeah, no, I I know a little bit of magic why you stream you could just do that like a hundred more times and
[5217.98s -> 5222.93s]  You'd be set. It's exponential if it keeps doubling. Would you like to know how to do it?
[5223.01s -> 5226.45s]  Would you let me to do the thing where the guy doesn't have the whole tv show about all the magic
[5227.25s -> 5230.53s]  The masked magician. Yeah, that show is so awesome
[5231.23s -> 5236.35s]  You know magicians were pissed about that. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah that guy was in like a lot of trouble
[5237.31s -> 5240.05s]  What
[5240.05s -> 5244.63s]  Is he like I like I like how they did shit. I like the idea of like a large group of magicians
[5249.41s -> 5252.67s]  I'm going to make your wife disappear
[5254.27s -> 5256.27s]  So if you guys want to like, you know
[5256.67s -> 5260.83s]  Impress your friends and stuff you you have to open with like the fun line of gosh man
[5260.83s -> 5262.50s]  That's stock market
[5262.50s -> 5266.82s]  Don't you wish you could die, you know buy buy a stock or security and have it go up by 50x
[5267.22s -> 5271.94s]  Like you start with that like, you know corny shit and then they go. Whoa, they lean in they get really curious
[5272.70s -> 5277.22s]  And then what you say is you say i've got a penny here and what you've got you do have a penny
[5277.22s -> 5281.17s]  But what you also have is you hold the two quarters here as well. The two quarters sit
[5281.57s -> 5285.41s]  Uh, is that perpendicular? What is that? Oh, I see. Yeah perpendicular. Oh, that's correct
[5285.97s -> 5291.73s]  So you make the ad it blocks everything especially it's like how could you even hold those quarters there show them the other hand
[5293.09s -> 5296.61s]  And then and then and then say excuse me you you in the audience. Excuse me
[5299.49s -> 5303.41s]  Would you would you like to buy one cent in my my new stock here and then they go
[5303.73s -> 5306.77s]  Of course, I will in this context really quick just so I can clarify i'm trying to learn
[5306.85s -> 5312.18s]  Um, so you're already on stage as a magician. Yes got it
[5314.34s -> 5316.85s]  Okay
[5316.85s -> 5325.17s]  Okay, so what we do is you take your thumb raise the bottom of the penny slide it underneath the second quarter grip
[5326.38s -> 5331.84s]  Hole with the other hand hide it behind the quarter. Oh, let's slide a hand
[5334.80s -> 5340.24s]  Yeah, no, that that's how you do it. Why do you ever do the thing where you uh, you put the salt shaker under the napkin
[5340.88s -> 5342.56s]  And you smash it
[5342.56s -> 5347.18s]  Uh, yeah, you like slide it off the table first and then you like smash it. Yeah, that's a good one
[5347.50s -> 5355.60s]  That's that's a that's a wow. That's a wild classic. Okay, so let's try to uh, pick a weapon up this time
[5356.24s -> 5360.16s]  Yeah, let's try to like survive longer than two minutes. Yes
[5360.72s -> 5368.93s]  I feel good about this game. Actually you take two turns like your your pokemon like rests for two turns
[5368.93s -> 5375.63s]  Then it comes out with like a really big attack. Yeah, we got we're winning this next game. Fuck it
[5375.63s -> 5378.11s]  I don't care speak it into the world bro. I'm with you
[5381.04s -> 5388.29s]  Okay, you want to hear the the prediction that's running over here? What's that is will I pick up a gun before I die?
[5389.97s -> 5393.41s]  And honestly like those odds are not great if you really think about
[5394.13s -> 5398.61s]  Yeah, if you're looking at statistics purely then the odds are not in your favor yet gambler fallacy, bro
[5398.93s -> 5401.73s]  It's not like it's going to influence the next event, you know
[5403.17s -> 5412.91s]  Think about that temple sapper. Honestly, I have two chap sticks
[5412.99s -> 5423.86s]  Um two different flavors play one game of fortnight with sap now. I got minecrafters following me. What happened to my skin?
[5424.42s -> 5429.54s]  I had a skin that I was happy. It made me look like a sweat and now I can't find it anywhere. I found it
[5430.59s -> 5432.91s]  Look, oh yeah, we're gonna be scared of us. That's yeah
[5434.02s -> 5437.46s]  Maybe we should all change skins because we sort of train people to think that we're easy
[5437.94s -> 5443.06s]  Yeah, they see they see like the the the blintz yaga and they're like, ah, really? That's all these fuckers
[5443.38s -> 5449.90s]  We're gonna ride guys. Can they see my level? Uh, I don't think they can when they spectate you
[5450.48s -> 5453.60s]  Yeah, all right, but not in the game. They don't go look level one get them
[5454.48s -> 5457.04s]  I don't think a single person has been able to spectate you yet, though
[5457.68s -> 5464.03s]  Any of us that is true. I didn't think about that. There's just nothing to watch for any of us. All right
[5464.03s -> 5467.95s]  I got my sweat costume. Oh, it's probably like, you know, where are these guys? What are they?
[5469.07s -> 5474.16s]  Are they even here? Do they go home? Yeah. Yeah, that's it. It's true
[5481.76s -> 5485.33s]  What you see lewis announcement? Wait, what do you do winning team?
[5485.49s -> 5489.66s]  All gets a $1,000 massage chair delivered to their home. All right guys, come on
[5489.66s -> 5492.22s]  We gotta quit fucking around now if we win the rest of them. We have a chance
[5492.86s -> 5496.88s]  It's true. We have two more matches. We have three, right?
[5497.68s -> 5501.76s]  No, they got rid of the fifth one. So we have to the time. Yeah. Oh my god. I know
[5502.32s -> 5504.64s]  Even if we win the next year, I don't even think we could win
[5504.88s -> 5510.29s]  We have to kill like the half the server. I wouldn't put it past us though. We have that
[5510.69s -> 5518.19s]  And I think we do have it we've actually gotten kind of it's been a little it's been a little rough where we've landed
[5519.52s -> 5524.11s]  Yeah, what the fuck? I'm so mad. I can't believe it. I can't wait to be diving
[5524.94s -> 5528.62s]  Look over and diving right next to me at the exact same speed as shroud
[5530.13s -> 5533.38s]  He just winks at you and just like oh, oh
[5535.44s -> 5540.32s]  Okay, if that happens, i'm just telling you guys i'm gonna pop parachute and i'm just going i'm just floating him to somewhere else
[5540.93s -> 5544.13s]  He's abandoning us mr president goes to the fallout shelter
[5544.45s -> 5557.36s]  I know I know shroud's skin now so I can determine if it's him. I think i'll actually beat that prediction though
[5557.36s -> 5559.36s]  I think i'll get a gun before dying this time
[5562.13s -> 5565.41s]  We have such a cool squad too. We could do so much fun
[5565.41s -> 5569.97s]  We could get in the car we could go jump around the buildings and stuff like come on we have this is such a cool squad
[5570.61s -> 5575.49s]  That's what i'm saying. I'm trying to have a goddamn wonder years episode with my boys
[5576.93s -> 5581.66s]  I never finished that show. I need to finish that
[5582.14s -> 5586.83s]  I remember was on netflix and I grinded it. I was
[5591.34s -> 5593.10s]  Why was that show so good
[5593.10s -> 5601.18s]  It's a really good question. I seemingly I like I remember it being like insanely good when I was watching it
[5601.58s -> 5603.10s]  Wait, what show?
[5603.10s -> 5604.30s]  Wonder years
[5604.30s -> 5613.10s]  It was a good show. Is it just is coming of age american coming of age just like hit the sweet spot in our brains
[5613.10s -> 5621.17s]  Maybe well that show was um, his brother had a mullet. That was how long was that show on the air?
[5621.17s -> 5626.05s]  I feel like it was on for a really long time. All right, we got the game three code
[5626.29s -> 5628.85s]  All right, let's get involved
[5630.27s -> 5631.54s]  All right

[5653.84s -> 5657.20s]  My boss are i'm just gonna buy one with the company card
[5657.68s -> 5662.88s]  Even if we lose I don't give a shit. I'm charging ludwig's card a thousand dollars for a massage chair
[5663.28s -> 5668.08s]  Regardless if we drop next to shroud this match, I am buying a massage chair on company dime
[5668.88s -> 5672.77s]  In between the match
[5672.77s -> 5677.25s]  We put it on the podcast next week. We call it a business expense. This is this is mogul moves
[5677.49s -> 5682.75s]  He's just telling me he ordered an extra three accidentally or something

[5687.38s -> 5689.38s]  That would be for you three. I don't deserve one
[5690.45s -> 5696.14s]  No, you deserve one. No, you deserve one. What the hell get that mentality up. I don't want to hear that
[5696.46s -> 5702.56s]  Yeah, come on it doesn't matter because we're just gonna win it anyways, but like on the off chance we don't
[5703.44s -> 5708.98s]  Right. Yeah, even if we do win i'm buying a second one to let him know that his tournament was bad
[5709.70s -> 5713.60s]  Nick myth is in our house fishing for compliments. Somebody said
[5715.92s -> 5720.54s]  Even though I just pulled up his stream ludwig's stream. Should we go ask him for help?
[5722.06s -> 5725.10s]  He hops on my setup, bro, hop on my fucking pc, please

[5751.23s -> 5753.55s]  The crowd can't even see the types of coins you're holding
[5754.75s -> 5767.34s]  So far away, what is that? My go-to magic trick was uh, that one from you guys you ever see now you see me

[5773.02s -> 5775.90s]  Out and the one the audience all saw that was my go-to
[5776.30s -> 5783.44s]  I my brain can't even remember half that movie. My that movie is just a trailer of people like throwing cards at each other
[5784.77s -> 5786.77s]  That that's not you see me too

[6138.77s -> 6143.01s]  Yeah, we should say the fuck away from everyone. We should definitely grab as much uh,
[6143.81s -> 6145.81s]  Health and shield as we can for sure
[6146.98s -> 6152.42s]  I have uh, I have what's it called splash. I could throw it at everyone. I've got six minis
[6156.74s -> 6158.74s]  I don't know. I went in the dumpster
[6159.94s -> 6161.94s]  Yeah
[6162.82s -> 6166.50s]  No, I thought I was dead dude, I was like what the fuck somebody like sniped me it was terrifying
[6167.30s -> 6172.42s]  Yeah, you you transported right? Yeah, I jumped off a building and it went in the dump. I'm so sorry. I just know it's okay
[6173.30s -> 6176.50s]  It's the same thing. That was important. I got my adrenaline up and that's gonna help me aim
[6180.56s -> 6183.52s]  I'm so i'm too i'm too neurotic to play this game
[6184.54s -> 6188.46s]  I think I think we're we're pretty mentally beaten, you know, so we gotta
[6189.42s -> 6195.33s]  It's it's very fair to feel good to actually like run around and shit. Holy fuck seriously
[6195.97s -> 6197.97s]  Yeah, I didn't know this game had controls
[6198.53s -> 6203.46s]  I gotta do this before we'd all right. Oh my god. We're far away from that. Aren't we pretty far?
[6203.62s -> 6205.62s]  Let's just start cranking it that way
[6208.08s -> 6217.20s]  You're pretty far nick. Yeah, i'm coming. Is there a reason why batman is on the screen right now blinking?
[6218.08s -> 6223.95s]  Yeah, that's like it's about if we kill him on the map. There's a yellow circle. That's where he is
[6224.67s -> 6228.03s]  Shock grenades are big that cars us that's nick. Yep
[6230.86s -> 6232.86s]  All right. We picked a good place to drop this time
[6235.44s -> 6240.32s]  All right, my loot pretty trash. Yeah, I got I got I got some minis up here someone wants to grab those. I have no space
[6241.38s -> 6246.26s]  We need to get like a keg would be really nice so we can all get up to 100 shield. I can splash us
[6246.82s -> 6248.82s]  All right, let's meet up in this house. Let's splash
[6249.38s -> 6252.58s]  Okay, there's no there's a blimp here. So be careful that there might be people on it
[6253.54s -> 6258.16s]  Let's see
[6258.24s -> 6260.00s]  The car
[6260.00s -> 6262.64s]  Here, what's splash up right here? I don't see anybody in the blimp
[6263.28s -> 6270.24s]  So is a smart thing to do just to yell out the number at the top of the screen
[6271.44s -> 6278.24s]  Yeah, that's pretty good. There's also 319. That works like like when when people shoot there's a red little uh thing that pops up on it
[6279.04s -> 6281.79s]  Wait, you say there's people 319
[6281.79s -> 6284.59s]  No, no, no, that was a dummy call out. Yeah, okay
[6287.62s -> 6290.82s]  Did no one go to this blimp? I'm kind of scared to go to this blimp and loot it
[6291.39s -> 6295.68s]  But this town looks unlooted below it. Yeah, we also don't have a lot of time
[6297.10s -> 6299.18s]  Yeah, but we can you we can use that we should go to the bump
[6299.18s -> 6306.66s]  What's with the bump because we can use the blimp to fly to your own frames. Oh
[6308.38s -> 6313.50s]  Uh, anyone have can you hold smalls? Uh sound up you hold small pots. I got I got six already
[6315.58s -> 6317.34s]  Actually, I can eat the big
[6317.34s -> 6320.06s]  Yeah, I could I would eat it. Never mind. I'll hold it. I got it
[6320.70s -> 6324.22s]  Dude, there's so much loot in this town. We should just yeah, let's loot loot this town and then use wait
[6324.46s -> 6329.82s]  This chest is open. This chest is open. Yep. That's true. Could be team here. I'm going over here
[6330.62s -> 6332.64s]  Going on the blimp
[6332.64s -> 6335.60s]  I'm gonna go with you. I'm not gonna i'm kind of scared to go in it
[6335.92s -> 6339.68s]  Maybe i'll take a little gandy. Yeah, this is looted. I'm just gonna stay on top of the blimp
[6340.00s -> 6342.00s]  i'm actually use use the blimp to
[6342.24s -> 6343.44s]  Glide out
[6343.44s -> 6344.88s]  That's a call
[6344.88s -> 6348.80s]  We all had enough. Yep. Yeah, and then we're just gonna fly away using the like the propeller things
[6350.10s -> 6352.98s]  I bet the team that was here already left. Yeah, I think they did as well
[6354.00s -> 6356.00s]  I think we should just be
[6356.00s -> 6360.82s]  Pussies and just stay like on the edge of the zone. Yeah. Oh shit. We gotta go now. Oh my god
[6360.82s -> 6368.62s]  It's coming out. It's not gonna hurt too bad. But yeah, i'm already in right on you
[6368.94s -> 6373.47s]  Okay, there's a blimp right here probably guaranteed a team on it. So stay away from that
[6373.47s -> 6376.59s]  There's some people in there. We should stay away from tilted in general. That's gonna be fucking
[6377.23s -> 6378.51s]  terrible
[6378.51s -> 6380.43s]  We should just keep looting these outer
[6380.43s -> 6382.43s]  Little things like this little hut and shit
[6383.07s -> 6391.50s]  There's still 60 people alive, bro. There's a green og in here. Just pretty nice on one set. I will need that
[6392.98s -> 6395.38s]  Did I heal a little bit or should I take this big?
[6396.03s -> 6401.50s]  Yep, when you when we get safe you can heal up but you shouldn't really need to because you can't heal with a bandage
[6401.50s -> 6403.36s]  And it's a waste of a medkit
[6403.36s -> 6406.88s]  Uh, there's mushrooms over here on my ping if you want to get your shield finish off
[6410.75s -> 6414.27s]  Okay, so the teams that are in tilted are gonna start moving towards us because of the next circle
[6414.27s -> 6416.99s]  So we should probably run like completely out of here. It's like let's go this way
[6417.55s -> 6422.19s]  Oh, there's a team people fighting in front of us. There's a fucking tank. Oh, it's a battle bus. Oh shit
[6423.15s -> 6426.59s]  Yeah, we should stay the fuck away from that. I do have a rocket. I have three purple rockets
[6426.67s -> 6429.79s]  No, we shouldn't fight on a thing give away in the I can kill one
[6431.65s -> 6435.57s]  Not nice. Nice. Good job. Finish up. Nice. We gotta kill
[6440.58s -> 6442.58s]  I didn't see anything. I was spraying myself in the face
[6443.06s -> 6444.26s]  No, that's
[6444.26s -> 6447.78s]  You're doing your job. You're you're using less that player made a call out where we are
[6447.78s -> 6451.36s]  So we should probably reposition. Yep
[6451.36s -> 6456.40s]  Do you think the rest of the teams right they're either right up here? I see over here. Wait, a car just turned on right next to me
[6457.28s -> 6460.48s]  Guy but jumping. Okay, I think we're getting run up on and done up on
[6461.82s -> 6463.82s]  Careful. Oh shit. I'm getting hit
[6464.22s -> 6468.13s]  This guy right here in front of me
[6468.13s -> 6471.65s]  Chilling i'm coming to you. I'm gonna come to you. I'm gonna fight with you. I'm backing up here
[6472.05s -> 6474.37s]  Yep, I don't really like maybe we just go back where we came from
[6478.51s -> 6480.51s]  Oh right right fire
[6480.83s -> 6483.94s]  Covering fire. Ah
[6483.94s -> 6488.74s]  Right there on my ping. He's he's coming behind us. He's flanking that tree. No, no, no, no, no
[6489.46s -> 6491.46s]  On us on us on us
[6492.50s -> 6495.70s]  God I don't I don't even I have a stay alive. Stay alive. Stay alive
[6498.26s -> 6501.38s]  I want you to I want you to stay all the way to the end, baby. Ah, that was excuse me
[6502.42s -> 6505.95s]  Okay, of course
[6505.95s -> 6506.75s]  Oh
[6506.75s -> 6513.68s]  Don't even engage to stay alive get get us towards the end. There's we have I think we have so many meds on
[6514.48s -> 6518.48s]  We have so many meds on us that you can stay in the oh shit. There's a guy right there
[6519.04s -> 6523.76s]  What I need is pause pause my fucking spotify
[6524.67s -> 6528.43s]  You're like the little brother that their mother forced them to play with their older brother
[6529.86s -> 6535.30s]  I mean, yeah, this is the first okay. I don't even know what the weapons distances are
[6539.87s -> 6541.87s]  It's fun, but
[6544.32s -> 6547.12s]  Because they're gonna dip right now and then you have a bunch of heels
[6547.36s -> 6553.66s]  I hope these okay as long as they didn't take them all turn the shadow with shadows off help
[6553.98s -> 6561.87s]  I don't why why am I dropping frames? That's fucking annoying then with this tree
[6565.25s -> 6570.45s]  Hey, all you gotta do stay alive simple enough. All right storm coming in
[6583.39s -> 6585.39s]  There's no fucking heels. Holy shit
[6586.61s -> 6588.45s]  Hold on. Okay
[6588.45s -> 6591.17s]  Yes, oh so swag that was the most swag thing i've ever seen
[6591.97s -> 6596.18s]  Holy shit, that was pretty cool
[6596.18s -> 6600.83s]  You got a great circle
[6600.83s -> 6603.23s]  Dude, holy shit. If you actually get those rezzes off
[6603.87s -> 6605.79s]  This is doable
[6605.79s -> 6609.87s]  I don't know the only fuck the only one is there it's gonna be tough reboot van
[6613.78s -> 6617.46s]  Yeah, when you die, you drop a little card and you go to the van and you can redeploy us
[6618.70s -> 6620.70s]  But you got to collect the card which he just did
[6621.10s -> 6627.01s]  Yeah, the frames are dropping because I went back to the original ingest server a week ago and now it's having problems again
[6627.65s -> 6633.07s]  Hooray, that's fucking fantastic. So i'm just gonna go to the other one and never turn back
[6633.84s -> 6640.02s]  You gotta be worried about getting fucking sniped from someone. There's so many players. Like they have one like has to be near you
[6640.78s -> 6648.94s]  Yeah, I know. Hopefully I can catch someone coming into the circle or something
[6650.06s -> 6652.70s]  So if you get to that van you can revive everybody
[6653.90s -> 6655.90s]  Yeah, wait, can I get in that battle bus?
[6656.38s -> 6665.78s]  That's a player. You saw one. Yeah. Yeah, hopefully the bus is probably out of gas if it's just sitting there
[6670.37s -> 6677.12s]  Oh, I can maybe steal some kills here. Oh nice. Yes, sir
[6679.04s -> 6682.56s]  That's x bro
[6684.40s -> 6687.15s]  The party bus
[6687.79s -> 6694.26s]  Oh shit i'm on fire with yes, sir
[6696.18s -> 6698.34s]  That was that was ridiculous. What just happened?
[6699.14s -> 6701.14s]  Someone blew it up with I think a rocket
[6701.62s -> 6704.98s]  X is probably still downed on that. Uh, Ron. No, no his friends are picking him up for sure
[6706.59s -> 6710.59s]  Yep, I didn't want to check do this. No, no, no, no, no. Yeah, I think you're in a good spot
[6711.55s -> 6713.55s]  Oh
[6716.59s -> 6719.95s]  How do you see me there that's crazy way better way better this time boys
[6721.87s -> 6722.75s]  Wow
[6722.75s -> 6725.95s]  All right, i'm reporting him
[6726.83s -> 6728.83s]  That's really the only option. Yeah
[6729.25s -> 6734.29s]  Dude, oh my xqc shroud xqc shroud delta was or no xqc shroud shot xqc
[6735.15s -> 6739.55s]  Yeah, I guess he knew maybe he just knew from where I shot him last time. He was just waiting looking for me there
[6740.99s -> 6743.23s]  I'm gonna brib one second. I'm switching twitch servers
[6743.87s -> 6747.55s]  All good. Look that was a lot better. We got all right. I'm switching servers
[6747.55s -> 6766.05s]  I'll switch the servers stream's gonna go off for 30 seconds. I'll be right back. Okay, i'm back
[6770.37s -> 6774.45s]  You got a gun germa and that's huge. That means you're improving. That's huge. Oh puns is down
[6775.76s -> 6781.76s]  Oh connor's down. Oh, I think that's it for the one and he's about to go down too. Yep. Well, it's all up to george
[6782.78s -> 6785.82s]  He's me man 13. All right, so we're not 19th
[6787.10s -> 6792.22s]  No, we are far from it us getting two kills that game probably solidified us not last
[6793.90s -> 6800.14s]  Which I can't stress this enough for you germa that is enormous when you live with the guy running the tournament
[6801.68s -> 6805.52s]  He's he's just gonna be such a pain in my ass about this
[6807.10s -> 6809.39s]  Why what do you mean?
[6809.39s -> 6812.67s]  well, ludwig is very competitive person and uh
[6813.47s -> 6815.57s]  I kind of made a big deal about
[6815.57s -> 6817.57s]  the fortnight tournament from last week
[6818.53s -> 6820.05s]  and uh
[6820.05s -> 6825.86s]  He's just he's just gonna he's just gonna rub it in and he's too strong. So I can't I can't
[6826.26s -> 6828.26s]  Is ludwig playing in this tournament?
[6828.58s -> 6833.78s]  No, he's just commenting. Oh, okay. He did last time he played and then hosted it
[6833.78s -> 6837.94s]  But I think that's too much which is understandable. Yeah jumping or he's spectating that much too
[6838.82s -> 6841.38s]  Is there gonna be one next week as well every monday?
[6842.90s -> 6844.90s]  Until he decides not to do him anymore
[6848.22s -> 6850.62s]  He really did pick a terrible day, huh? Anthony
[6851.71s -> 6854.43s]  Second worst dream. Hey refresh i'm back
[6855.23s -> 6858.27s]  No more dropped frames. I'm never going back to that server again
[6861.78s -> 6867.92s]  What right when I said it are you kidding me at a specific time ludwig londay?
[6868.40s -> 6872.69s]  Then he adds the fortnight event. Why is he going past it? I guess I guess
[6873.25s -> 6876.21s]  Drum shotgun is that good if he's like passing up a purple
[6877.34s -> 6881.10s]  Uh auto shotgun it is the drum. It's like drum over any other shotgun
[6883.54s -> 6885.54s]  Carl seems really deep into this
[6887.74s -> 6895.86s]  What the fuck why did it get worse? Oh my god, i'm about my internet's about to go off
[6904.72s -> 6906.72s]  Am I still in the call with you guys?
[6906.72s -> 6909.42s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah
[6909.42s -> 6912.78s]  My connection to the twitch servers are fucking awful right now
[6914.51s -> 6919.55s]  Wait carl's are you guys watching carl like his team could just annihilate this. Yeah. Yeah, this is there there's
[6920.42s -> 6928.03s]  They're set if I was him. I would just open fire on these guys. I wonder who's igle. Who's who's telling him to hold back?
[6928.43s -> 6931.15s]  I don't know. I guess the only reason yeah
[6931.15s -> 6933.79s]  If it was this this is the thing that's the most annoying thing about the twitch server shit
[6934.35s -> 6939.49s]  If this was my internet, I would be that call would be all robotic. What the fuck
[6941.28s -> 6969.68s]  Why does twitch hate my connection coming in? It's fucking annoying. I'll be right back one more time, dude
[6969.76s -> 6978.50s]  I I cannot connect to twitch my my internet is perfect. What like what the fuck?
[6981.09s -> 6983.46s]  I don't understand why this keeps happening
[6983.46s -> 6989.62s]  I cannot connect to twitch's twitch's server is a junk for me, but i'm in the game. My internet's fine
[6990.26s -> 6992.90s]  Um, listen
[6992.90s -> 6994.90s]  Oh carl get shot out of the sky
[6995.06s -> 6997.06s]  Look at this. Oh, it's a 4v1
[6997.06s -> 6998.35s]  Unreal
[6998.35s -> 7006.02s]  But I my call's not robotic. It's only connecting to twitch. What the fuck i'm trying something else. I'm trying something else be right back
[7006.34s -> 7015.07s]  Okay, let's try let's try this guys. I don't fucking get it
[7022.22s -> 7023.50s]  Murdered it out
[7023.50s -> 7029.86s]  Okay, when this is over i'm mutating ludwig. I'm deleting his phone number. I'm queuing valor and feel something dude
[7030.18s -> 7032.18s]  Well, let's just move out
[7032.74s -> 7034.10s]  I'm tired
[7034.10s -> 7036.14s]  I'm weary
[7036.14s -> 7040.03s]  Okay, so I i'm just like routing my traffic
[7040.83s -> 7044.99s]  In about you know, I don't know why twitch hates my connection so much sometimes
[7045.79s -> 7055.65s]  But I went to three or four different servers. What the fuck is happening? All right. We're good
[7056.37s -> 7059.81s]  All right. I'm good to go. I'm back
[7060.37s -> 7062.37s]  They couldn't hold us down forever
[7062.69s -> 7064.69s]  That was better though. That was better. We got one more
[7064.77s -> 7069.31s]  Yeah, one more last game. Let's try I kind of want I kind of want there just to be five
[7070.35s -> 7078.67s]  Dude, right the false start at the beginning was well was great for us. I won't lie
[7079.07s -> 7080.27s]  Yeah
[7080.27s -> 7095.12s]  That's fixed now cool. Yeah, so I have no idea why that keeps happening
[7095.98s -> 7097.98s]  randomly for no reason
[7098.00s -> 7098.88s]  my
[7098.88s -> 7103.44s]  Data coming in through twitch from vegas. It just hates it and it just kills me
[7104.00s -> 7107.98s]  But I jump around to like five different servers and it's like, okay. I'm gonna here you go. You're fine
[7108.14s -> 7110.38s]  Literally like as if the problem never existed
[7111.02s -> 7115.76s]  None of my internet goes down. I'm at full speed full speed ahead. Nothing. I don't get it
[7116.40s -> 7120.43s]  You got zero viewers. Shut up
[7127.55s -> 7132.37s]  Laying in bed, can I be honest? I've gotten a battle royale
[7133.17s -> 7135.57s]  In uh pubg mobile before oh really you played too
[7136.69s -> 7139.89s]  And when it first came out in high school, I played it a little bit when I was on class
[7140.45s -> 7142.45s]  That's high. That's dude
[7143.01s -> 7144.14s]  How old are you?
[7144.14s -> 7149.82s]  Uh, 21. Oh my god. I'm 10 years older than you kids had it so good. You know what I did we played psp
[7150.46s -> 7153.82s]  Grant f. Dotto liberty city stories and we wi-fi like
[7154.44s -> 7159.02s]  Multi-playered I shot my friend jfk style out of a convertible with a sniper rifle on a psp
[7159.42s -> 7161.58s]  It's actually my greatest gaming achievement to this day
[7163.26s -> 7164.53s]  I
[7164.53s -> 7167.90s]  You say that you're 10 years older got some news for you
[7170.06s -> 7174.30s]  I am the middle bear here, huh? Super mario brothers released by the regular nintendo
[7176.22s -> 7177.74s]  That's fucked up
[7177.74s -> 7180.94s]  Yeah, I was I was a model warfare 2 land in high school
[7181.10s -> 7182.14s]  I had to get uh
[7182.14s -> 7185.50s]  My father would always come over and say hey get me six lives and get me to the last boss
[7185.74s -> 7188.06s]  And i'll beat it because we just couldn't do it me and my siblings
[7188.38s -> 7193.79s]  So we would have we would spend the whole game trying to get to six lives to get to the last part
[7194.43s -> 7200.03s]  The last level where bowser was and my dad would take the controller and he would beat it as long as we had six lives
[7201.36s -> 7202.48s]  Why?
[7202.48s -> 7205.87s]  Why was he why was he it was like a sweatshop?
[7206.77s -> 7211.09s]  Well, no, he was just he knew he could beat the game at that point
[7211.09s -> 7213.89s]  He'd almost memorize the level but in case he died three or four times
[7214.05s -> 7221.58s]  He didn't want to upset his children. What if he didn't do it anthony ready up. Oh, sorry. Sorry. That is extremely funny
[7221.66s -> 7226.54s]  How many stepped up how many pubg mobile victor rails under your belt? Oh god, I don't know
[7226.62s -> 7229.90s]  Maybe I feel like whenever I was playing I was playing against like bots
[7229.90s -> 7233.82s]  So I got quite a few but like it wasn't it didn't feel like good like, you know what I mean?
[7235.66s -> 7237.18s]  I feel rewarding. You know what I want
[7237.18s -> 7241.90s]  I want pubg like the actual game to come back that game whenever that came out that was like
[7242.30s -> 7245.26s]  Peak like that was one of the most funs i've had on it was so fun
[7245.34s -> 7248.14s]  Yeah, it was ridiculous. Like I remember my friends me my buddies in high school
[7248.62s -> 7251.50s]  The bit was we just drop pochinki and then just run it
[7252.54s -> 7257.18s]  Dropping school. Yeah, there was pochinki. There was school. I never dropped school school was too much for me
[7257.34s -> 7262.54s]  It was just ridiculous. Yeah, it's a 10 second game if you land but it was it was just so fun
[7262.94s -> 7265.58s]  I think it was it was showing how fun it was
[7266.06s -> 7270.46s]  Even though the game was like such a buggy piece of shit. We all put up with it because we're like this is sick
[7271.23s -> 7277.39s]  Yeah, and still buggy piece of shit to the people playing daisy daisy was huge. Oh my god, dude
[7277.39s -> 7284.08s]  I loved daisy. I loved daisy so much like so so much. I used to like play like rp servers
[7284.40s -> 7286.40s]  I thought the rp servers were more fun
[7286.40s -> 7292.08s]  Because like there's like dedicated zones where you could kill people just like randomly and otherwise you had to like rob them
[7292.08s -> 7293.65s]  Which was really fun
[7293.65s -> 7294.29s]  Yeah
[7294.29s -> 7299.65s]  That was a real interesting social experiment because people would that was one of the first times people were just kind of given a piece

[7433.79s -> 7437.62s]  And there were just videos of people interacting with each other

[8539.57s -> 8541.57s]  And then we all ended up in the same place
[8543.28s -> 8546.48s]  And then not only did they do that, but then they all continued to only shoot it up
[8548.16s -> 8550.32s]  They were like waving at each other like neighbors, dude
