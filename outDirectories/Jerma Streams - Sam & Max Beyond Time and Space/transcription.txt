[3.00s -> 12.30s]  Late. I actually just walked in here, just moving some stuff around. I went to the bathroom
[12.30s -> 17.02s]  and saw the time. I saw it was 3 59 and I said, oh fuck, and I pressed the button.
[21.08s -> 34.10s]  I ain't even fucking ready, but I'm gonna press it. That was an awful little laugh. What are you
[34.10s -> 40.44s]  talking about? You've been doing this all week. Hey, I was live at 11 15 yesterday.
[41.08s -> 62.18s]  The window was 11 to 12 yesterday and I was there at 11 15. Right? Yeah, but that was
[62.18s -> 71.43s]  yesterday. This is today. The one time you're early. There's no, look, there is no early or
[71.43s -> 78.31s]  late anymore. There is between three and four. That's it. Might start at three. Might start at
[78.31s -> 84.25s]  four. Just gives me that window so it doesn't matter. Usually though, all jokes aside,
[84.25s -> 91.80s]  usually though, if you look back at the last like three or four weeks, it's usually been
[91.80s -> 101.26s]  like 3 40, like 350. So between three and four p.m. has averaged out somehow to like 3 45,
[102.90s -> 111.56s]  like 3 40 and 3 50. Well, that's the design. That's what it's there for.
[115.83s -> 120.33s]  Just make it 3 30 to 4 30. No, because no, no, I can't do that. Because look,
[121.21s -> 127.77s]  the whole point of this whole thing was to make sure that I didn't start after four.
[128.41s -> 131.53s]  You know what I mean? Because like if I got a three to four hour window, like what, are you
[131.53s -> 138.49s]  kidding me? Making it 3 30 to 4 30 is then like, oh, I got it till 4 30 now. No, no, no, no,
[138.49s -> 143.93s]  no. It's to make sure that I like get fucking ready and get here between three and four.
[148.46s -> 153.02s]  The more you push that window forward, the more it's like, wow, 5 30. All right, fine. I'll
[153.02s -> 170.14s]  start at 5 22. But anyways, how you doing? Make it within a 24 hour range. Well, the idea
[170.14s -> 177.94s]  was that, okay, I got rid of the schedule, right? So no, it is not like, oh, Tuesday, Thursday,
[177.94s -> 182.82s]  Friday, and that's it. It's, we'll just do whatever. Getting rid of the time schedule
[182.82s -> 187.94s]  was also part of the plan, but I didn't want to do that. So I kept it at like the three to
[187.94s -> 195.86s]  fourish sort of range because I don't want to just have it be, oh yeah, he's going to be
[195.86s -> 202.89s]  live at some point at some time. That doesn't make any sense. Why would I do that? All right,
[202.89s -> 210.06s]  guys, I'll see you streams over for today. I'll see you guys at some point at some time.
[211.78s -> 216.65s]  You mean tomorrow? I don't know. You mean what? You mean like this week? Yeah. Oh yeah. I'll
[216.65s -> 220.54s]  stream at some point this week, but at some time, it's like, it's like sitting there
[220.54s -> 229.53s]  waiting at the telephone. Is he going to call? Hey, that's like, can I get your number? Yeah,
[229.53s -> 234.68s]  yeah, sure. I'll give you my number. What's your number? Thank you. Thank you. What do you
[234.68s -> 239.58s]  want to like, when do you think he'll call? At some point at some time. Don't do that to
[239.58s -> 250.12s]  me. Tell me if you're going to call me tomorrow. Anyways, let's move on. Today is going to be Sam
[250.12s -> 263.51s]  and Max season two. I'm going to start, he's ghosting his chat. I've never done that.
[265.32s -> 270.52s]  Actually, well, I have maybe a few times, but we're going to do season two, episode one
[270.52s -> 279.91s]  of Sam and Max. Can you, could you already tell that will there be anything else than
[279.91s -> 286.89s]  Sam and Max? So I, I know. No, Sam, we're just going to do probably the first two episodes of
[286.89s -> 294.14s]  Sam and Max tonight. And then tomorrow, that's right, four days in a row. Tell him to get rid
[294.14s -> 302.33s]  of that schedule. And I have unleashed. You see, you see, it's the same thing.
[302.33s -> 306.65s]  Look, look, look. I know. Oops. I'm sorry. I know people are going to be like, I know,
[306.65s -> 313.78s]  I know we get it. Just go. But listen, removing the schedule. It's the same idea of
[313.78s -> 320.36s]  having the window there, right? Or giving like a perfect time. Cause if I have a three
[320.36s -> 325.37s]  day a week schedule, I'm only going to stream three days a week, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday.
[327.02s -> 331.56s]  That's it. Okay. Bye. I don't have to worry about anything. Just that's it.
[332.65s -> 335.21s]  See now I can, whenever I feel like it, we can just fucking keep going.
[335.77s -> 345.43s]  I can, I could go three, four, five straight days, whatever. Keep talking to us. No,
[345.43s -> 348.79s]  with no schedule, you can stream less. Oh, that's true, but that's not the case.
[349.59s -> 354.65s]  All right. If that was the case, is he mad? No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, mad.
[354.65s -> 357.93s]  No, no, no, no. I'm just trying to give some more insight. It's some more lore for
[357.93s -> 365.61s]  the Wiki page. Keep stalling. All right. You think I'm stalling? It's already ready to go.
[365.61s -> 376.68s]  Bang. Game paused. Press space. All I have to do is press space. Oh,
[376.68s -> 381.16s]  fucking set. Who set him off? No, no, no. I'm not. I'm just, nobody set me off. Don't
[381.16s -> 391.85s]  worry. See, it's right there. I can just press it. That's a screenshot. Oh yeah. You
[391.85s -> 400.90s]  think that's a screenshot? Is it now, huh? What you guys don't know is I animated all
[400.90s -> 409.61s]  this in dreams. That's not a video. Hold on. Let me just tweet this. All right. Too long,
[410.57s -> 416.06s]  too long streamer stalling for fucking 10 minutes before we do anything. No schedule,
[416.06s -> 420.70s]  no timeframe means I stream more. I need to get more of me. I don't know if you want
[420.70s -> 423.26s]  that or not. Maybe you don't want that. Maybe you're like, dude, we liked it when you were
[423.26s -> 437.08s]  less. Get the fuck out of here. Called dentist waiting room. All right. Here we go. Season
[437.08s -> 442.74s]  one, uh, season two. Sorry, I'm saying Max, but I didn't even get a chance to ask you
[442.74s -> 447.99s]  guys how has your day been going? That's the ultimate stall question.
[456.44s -> 462.52s]  Because I'm talking, okay, I'm typing right now a tweet saying that I'm live. Hey,
[462.52s -> 466.28s]  and so by the way, how has your day been? Let's go ahead. Give me some answers here.
[469.99s -> 471.59s]  All right. Season two.
[480.49s -> 489.94s]  All right. Now it's official. I gotta go. Season two, episode one, Sam and Max.
[491.02s -> 497.50s]  Let's see what the intro is doing for us today. Congratulations on another successful
[497.50s -> 503.74s]  peace summit, Mr. President. Don't congratulate me. Congratulate the peacemaker. You crack me
[503.74s -> 508.78s]  up a little brain salad. Oh, that was, he just, he's been acting surly and withdrawn
[509.26s -> 512.46s]  even for a vice president, but I never thought it would come to this.
[513.82s -> 518.78s]  His lust for power has twisted him into a mockery of the goldfish. We once kind of loved
[518.78s -> 525.10s]  that in sushi and fin flapping that glassy malevolent stare like a sociopath or a Fox
[525.10s -> 532.94s]  newscaster. Mr. Spatula has become pure evil. Why would he do staging a spatula? Not on my
[532.94s -> 542.65s]  watch. Eliminate him. You are my idol. I didn't. Why did they do that?
[545.45s -> 550.09s]  Hi fellas. Hey, what's the rumpus? I'm in the middle of some sensitive PI business.
[550.09s -> 553.69s]  And we respect your sensitivity. Is that mechanical goon one of yours?
[556.17s -> 558.89s]  Secret sideburns of Isaac Asimov. My name Tron.
[558.97s -> 571.51s]  That's what Mr. Spatula gets for sending a hitman with lousy aim.
[571.51s -> 575.11s]  Max, what say we go down and administer a freelance police style beat down to that
[575.11s -> 580.39s]  metal monstrosity? And then dance on its smoking carcass. It's that attention to detail that
[580.39s -> 592.23s]  makes me glad you're still president, little buddy. Sorry, I had to, I had something, I had to
[592.23s -> 600.49s]  talk to you real quick. All right, so first of all, this is important. I need to make sure
[600.49s -> 608.01s]  this is in the right settings. Are these right? Wait, is it, is Cox coming back? Help not.
[609.93s -> 615.48s]  I think this is fine. I had to do this because I couldn't do full screen,
[616.36s -> 623.08s]  because full screen wasn't gonna work. Top titles are on, hint level. They added this
[623.08s -> 630.14s]  in season two. I can't turn this on, right? People would make fun of me. I think we're
[630.14s -> 636.23s]  good. All right, let's go see what this thing's doing. He's tearing apart the entire
[636.87s -> 647.19s]  building. That's fucking kind of loud though. Hold on, that's the thing. We're not dropping frames,
[647.19s -> 658.70s]  right? We better not be. All right, what do you say? Hello? We didn't see you at all last year,
[658.70s -> 664.46s]  Flint. What gives? Okay, that was weird. I had one hell of a crazy case, fellas.
[664.46s -> 670.22s]  Boiling a conspiracy in the movie biz, matching wits with a reanimated Grover Cleveland,
[670.22s -> 675.02s]  breaking up Ascension's cell phone network, and a showdown with a cult leader on Saturn's
[675.02s -> 681.24s]  sergeant moon. It's wall dead. Wow, come we never get to do cool stuff like that.
[682.84s -> 689.32s]  That really is wall dead. All right, so I don't have, what do I have? Gun? Shoot robot with
[689.32s -> 697.82s]  gun. Not even a gun. They just don't make bullets like they used to. Wall dead. He's
[697.82s -> 713.54s]  tearing apart the entire building. He's tearing apart the entire building. I'm worried, Max.
[713.54s -> 716.58s]  Worried that enormous black mole on your back might be malignant?
[716.58s -> 721.46s]  Well, I am now. I was just worried that the giant robot was going to tear down our building.
[722.66s -> 731.08s]  Can you hear me? Okay, the button's fucked up. How are things going with your presidency?
[731.08s -> 736.20s]  The winds of progress are blowing swift and juicy, Sam. I'm proudest of the new law I
[736.20s -> 741.64s]  just pushed through congress. I'm pretty sure he who smelt it dealt it was already established
[741.64s -> 748.30s]  during the Eisenhower administration, little pal. I enjoy our little chats. Anything for a
[748.30s -> 754.49s]  friend and registered voter. I'm excited for season fucking two. What's this? We should just
[754.49s -> 759.61s]  accept we'll never teach that chief to be an arts grand master. How do I stop a robot from
[759.61s -> 763.21s]  punching me? Banana peels are a lot better than what he used to fling at it.
[763.45s -> 770.76s]  All right, this is really loud. Like, too loud for comfort. We can't do anything out here.
[770.76s -> 773.16s]  He's tearing apart. Should we leave? Should we just leave?
[782.30s -> 790.73s]  What goes up must come down. The boss goes back. Just to tell you once again who's back.
[797.24s -> 801.80s]  He may be a mechanized engine of wanton destruction, but his taste in hideous
[801.80s -> 808.63s]  middle of the road pop music is impeccable dead. No, they wouldn't kill a main character like that.
[809.43s -> 814.54s]  I don't believe it for a second. All right, so he's lost that loving feeling.
[816.94s -> 819.82s]  Excuse me, Mr. ginormous wind up toy of destruction.
[822.46s -> 825.74s]  Yes, I don't suppose you care to start. What do you want?
[826.38s -> 833.40s]  Hmm. In truth, it does not matter. I exist only as a mechanized engine for destruction.
[833.40s -> 837.16s]  What I do is what I am, whether I care for it or not.
[837.16s -> 841.40s]  Oh, no, Sam, he's been to community college. It's trouble. All right.
[842.84s -> 850.17s]  All right, so we're not I have a question. You seem like a smart guy for a robot.
[850.17s -> 854.01s]  Can you explain something to us? There is no question you could have
[854.01s -> 859.77s]  that I could not answer immediately. Okay. No, no, no, no. Put that away.
[860.89s -> 865.93s]  Max, you're always screwing things up. God, I love them. Why are you doing this? What if all
[865.93s -> 870.89s]  this is an illusion? Why do fools fall in love? He's having love. He's saying stuff about
[870.89s -> 876.89s]  love. Let's ask him that. Why do fools fall in love? Why do birds sing so gay and lovers
[876.89s -> 881.53s]  await the break of day? All right. Well, that stopped him from doing something from
[881.53s -> 886.49s]  attacking the building. I wonder what that means now. Maybe we come back and we
[887.85s -> 893.18s]  throw a grenade at him. I don't know. We're going to go to Bosco's. He's selling a
[894.60s -> 899.37s]  limb tear off device and it turns out as a grenade. The car's fucked up.
[899.37s -> 905.37s]  I've spent too many cycles processing this query. I might as well face it. I'm addicted
[905.37s -> 911.62s]  to show. So that stops him. I don't think I can do anything else.
[913.70s -> 919.62s]  Excuse me, Mr. Manedron. He didn't go high enough. He should have went.
[923.30s -> 928.62s]  All right. Let's do again. I have a question. I want to ask you something. Why do birds
[928.62s -> 932.70s]  appear every time you're near? What if all this is an illusion? Why do birds
[932.70s -> 937.02s]  appear every time you're near? Why do birds suddenly appear every time you are near?
[937.02s -> 945.34s]  Do that. Fascinating. All right. You get him to start thinking and then.
[949.54s -> 959.70s]  Wait, hold on. The robot sounds like Kylo Ren. I seem to get to turn him off. Reach
[959.70s -> 970.20s]  out the window and turn off his thing. Pull the key up. Oh, you were trying to
[970.20s -> 975.88s]  destroy us and worse. You butchered every song I wish I'd forgotten. And another one
[975.88s -> 982.60s]  bites. And another one bites. And another one bites. I didn't kill him.
[989.80s -> 998.38s]  I didn't kill him. He's alive. Check the closet. Oh, that's from season one. Here's
[998.38s -> 1005.86s]  the Whack the Rats bulletin board. Cool. Pardoned. Have you been abusing your
[1005.86s -> 1009.94s]  presidential powers again, Max? He's not. That depends on what your definition of
[1010.02s -> 1021.66s]  abuse is. He's not dead. He has a wind-up toy in his back. He cannot die. He cannot
[1021.66s -> 1029.30s]  die. He cannot live. He can merely exist. And I know what you're saying. Oh, hey,
[1029.30s -> 1032.74s]  Jeremy. What about your fucking body's electrolytes? That's the same exact
[1032.74s -> 1038.82s]  thing as pulling the key out. No, it's not. So he's just. Who is he fighting?
[1038.82s -> 1047.74s]  What's he doing in here? I'm surprised this game survived being thrown clear
[1047.74s -> 1052.46s]  at the Playland and Casino explosion. Nobody's saying that. Yeah, they are.
[1052.46s -> 1066.17s]  You're thinking it. I forget which. It's the orange. Okay, it's the orange one. I
[1066.17s -> 1073.21s]  didn't know. I forgot. I'll get that better. Hold on. Do it again. I don't
[1073.21s -> 1095.24s]  lose. I don't. I never lose. Don't say that. I don't lose. I don't lose.
[1095.24s -> 1106.26s]  Don't ever say that to me again. I don't ever lose. It's our Salvia
[1106.26s -> 1110.34s]  Hispanic of Brady culture here. Safe and fun gardening at home with no
[1110.42s -> 1113.62s]  threat of legal action due to trademark infringement.
[1113.62s -> 1118.10s]  Oh, okay. All right, let's go check on the robot.
[1118.10s -> 1123.45s]  We pressed a few buttons. Not bad, kid.
[1123.45s -> 1132.55s]  Question, Sam. How do you like me now, spatula?
[1132.55s -> 1135.83s]  I'll ignore that question, Max, in order to say, look,
[1135.83s -> 1139.51s]  holy knuckle cracking cringles on a bullet train with a sack full of head-covered cheese.
[1139.51s -> 1142.23s]  I wish Jerma played Joffrey in Game of Thrones.
[1142.23s -> 1146.07s]  We were wrong about Mr. Spatula all along. What do you mean
[1146.63s -> 1149.11s]  why?
[1150.55s -> 1154.79s]  It was sent from a bleak and desolate wasteland by the most ancient and
[1154.79s -> 1160.79s]  powerful opponent we've ever faced. A hairy, bloated, pagan god.
[1160.79s -> 1165.83s]  To Sam and Max from Santa. Why is, why would Santa be sending us, um...
[1166.39s -> 1174.47s]  Dun-unh, dun-unh, dun-unh, dun-unh-unh. Dun-unh, dun-unh, dun-unh, dun-unh-unh.
[1174.47s -> 1200.58s]  Dun-unh, dun-unh, dun-unh, dun-unh-unh. Dun-unh, dun-unh, dun-unh, dun-unh.
[1200.58s -> 1205.08s]  I missed my cue. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1205.08s -> 1209.40s]  Goodbye, Santa. Leave the talking to me. And the hasty trial, the harsh
[1209.40s -> 1213.64s]  sentencing, and the immediate execution. I took a bite out of a sandwich.
[1213.64s -> 1217.64s]  God damn it. Don't I get to do anything?
[1218.60s -> 1224.17s]  Don't, I can't restart it. God damn, that was a perfect opportunity.
[1224.17s -> 1229.05s]  I don't know. I took a bite out of my sandwich. I have a sandwich over here.
[1229.05s -> 1233.53s]  Hold on. I was gonna, I was gonna go like this.
[1233.53s -> 1237.59s]  It's too late now, but just add it. Add it.
[1237.59s -> 1239.83s]  Somebody add it to the end of that. I know someone's gonna fucking clip it
[1239.83s -> 1255.62s]  or something, but add this. Oh, hey look, Max. It's the soda
[1255.62s -> 1258.10s]  poppers. Again. We thought you'd all gotten
[1258.10s -> 1260.50s]  taken out in the Great Dakotan Conflict.
[1260.50s -> 1263.94s]  You might be relieved to see we made it. Right.
[1263.94s -> 1269.22s]  Relieved. What are you doing here? We all got terrible presents from Santa.
[1269.22s -> 1272.82s]  So we decided to come to the North Pole and return them.
[1272.82s -> 1276.10s]  Better that than spending Christmas Eve with a shotgun aimed at the
[1276.10s -> 1279.46s]  fireplace. Kids today have no respect for
[1279.46s -> 1282.26s]  tradition, Sam. Yeah, these, these guys again.
[1282.26s -> 1288.60s]  Why don't you go inside? We were on our way in when we heard some
[1288.64s -> 1291.72s]  frightening noises. That's the end of the Cowboy Bebop intro.
[1291.72s -> 1295.40s]  It almost sounded like. I thought you guys liked that shit.
[1295.40s -> 1300.12s]  Yeah. I'll write it down. Why am I the only one who associates Christmas with
[1300.12s -> 1309.61s]  the sound of gunfire? Best not to think about it, Max.
[1309.61s -> 1312.41s]  Uh yeah, weren't they governors? Aren't you guys governors of the Dakotas?
[1312.41s -> 1318.73s]  We were, but that wasn't enough. So we annexed Nebraska. Unfortunately, there
[1318.73s -> 1323.45s]  was a bit of a disagreement. With who? 2.5 million
[1323.53s -> 1329.42s]  voters. They won. Are you going to run for reelection?
[1329.42s -> 1335.26s]  No, now we're focused on environmental issues. We've got a new respect for
[1335.26s -> 1338.62s]  nature since we got kicked out of the governor's mansion.
[1338.62s -> 1344.63s]  Can we stay with you guys? No. Are they?
[1344.63s -> 1348.25s]  Okay. Well, what did you get from Santa? What did you get from Santa?
[1348.25s -> 1352.25s]  A jar full of rhinoceros musk. Yes, another one.
[1352.33s -> 1357.29s]  I got a see-through 90. It's beautiful, but I don't have the hips for it.
[1357.29s -> 1360.33s]  I'll trade you. Why? What did you get?
[1360.33s -> 1365.06s]  Tuberculosis. That's what I gave Sam last year.
[1365.06s -> 1368.82s]  Don't do it. And that's why we no longer have secret Santa at the
[1368.82s -> 1371.54s]  office. Don't fucking do it. I know some of
[1371.54s -> 1377.34s]  you guys don't. You dare. Okay. We should be going. Christmas
[1377.34s -> 1381.74s]  isn't going to save itself. Yeah, not like that snobby self-sufficient
[1381.74s -> 1390.02s]  St. Patrick's Day. All right, so we gotta go
[1390.02s -> 1393.22s]  Santa's Workshop, the second happiest place on Earth. The first
[1393.22s -> 1400.98s]  happiest place in the Disney world. He's really let himself go.
[1400.98s -> 1404.90s]  I should make a snowman on stream. I can't do that.
[1404.90s -> 1408.10s]  I live in the desert. Oh, I forgot I don't live
[1408.10s -> 1418.87s]  in Massachusetts anymore. I can't do that. Never mind. Wait, what's this?
[1418.95s -> 1426.46s]  Yellow snow reclamation. Just make a sandman.
[1426.46s -> 1430.30s]  Bleaches it into fresh sanitary snow. Want to have a snowball fight?
[1430.30s -> 1434.18s]  Not without industrial goggles, I don't.
[1434.18s -> 1438.34s]  What do I do? Okay, I have a snowball. This is a pea snowball.
[1438.34s -> 1447.06s]  I throw it. He gonna throw this in his face? Hey, wizard.
[1447.06s -> 1450.66s]  Please forgive us for what we are about to do. Oh, crap.
[1450.66s -> 1454.82s]  You guys are gonna kill me, aren't you? Yeah, we're gonna kill you.
[1454.82s -> 1461.05s]  You need to relax. Take a deep breath. Put your guard down.
[1461.05s -> 1466.01s]  I don't know why I'm so tense all the time.
[1466.01s -> 1470.82s]  All right, let me tell you something. That sucked. You ever been hit in the
[1470.82s -> 1473.30s]  face by a snowball before? It's not fun.
[1473.30s -> 1479.26s]  Of the smell of snowballs in the morning.
[1479.26s -> 1485.30s]  It really, really fucking hurts and it's like this equal parts
[1485.30s -> 1489.30s]  numb, pain, cold. It goes down your neck into your shirt and
[1489.62s -> 1499.91s]  it's awful. All right, well, I have a snowball here
[1499.91s -> 1503.03s]  and it really depends on the snow too. You can get
[1503.03s -> 1508.23s]  packed up really, really wet snow and it's like getting punched in the face
[1508.23s -> 1511.43s]  by a fist. People don't realize that shit.
[1511.43s -> 1518.97s]  Mostly. Not him, Santa. He forced us to make all those awful hurtful toys.
[1518.97s -> 1524.25s]  We don't know what's gotten into him. Whoa.
[1524.25s -> 1529.61s]  The snow will turn red with the blood of the knot.
[1529.61s -> 1536.50s]  The cartoons always made him seem a lot more jolly.
[1536.50s -> 1540.34s]  If you have wet snow and you pack it up and throw a snowball at somebody,
[1540.34s -> 1543.22s]  you are throwing a baseball at them and then it's like it's all fun and
[1543.22s -> 1546.10s]  games. Would you throw a baseball at your
[1546.10s -> 1550.55s]  friend's face as hard as you can? Why would you do that with a snowball?
[1550.55s -> 1553.67s]  It's not, it's fake. It's made out of like fluffy water.
[1553.67s -> 1558.66s]  No, no, no. It's a baseball you're throwing at your friend's head.
[1558.66s -> 1562.50s]  We're trying to talk to Santa. You know him? Mind if I keep cowering?
[1562.50s -> 1566.18s]  I'd encourage it. Just remember to cower with your legs,
[1566.18s -> 1572.23s]  not your back. The evidence melts away.
[1572.23s -> 1583.24s]  Whoa. I would, I would track that guy. Okay, uh, see anything unusual?
[1583.24s -> 1586.84s]  Well, this morning I could have sworn I felt the presence
[1586.92s -> 1590.76s]  of an unspeakable evil. Tell us more about this.
[1590.76s -> 1594.84s]  That doesn't even look like me. Give me a break. I'd rather not speak about it.
[1594.84s -> 1602.78s]  My teeth are way better. You all know that.
[1602.78s -> 1606.14s]  All right, so unspeakable evil. Can't you tell us anything about that
[1606.14s -> 1613.29s]  unspeakable evil? No. Don't you know what unspeakable means?
[1613.29s -> 1616.65s]  Okay, what's, what is he doing? Why is he doing this? Santa went nuts.
[1616.65s -> 1621.13s]  Beat me? I'm the intern. I just came off the assembly line yesterday.
[1621.13s -> 1624.89s]  Jumping jacks and half stacks of hat racks. Are you saying elves are made in
[1624.89s -> 1627.77s]  factories? Because if you are, I want to place an
[1627.77s -> 1631.61s]  order for six million. Also, tell my army they're fired.
[1631.61s -> 1636.25s]  No, I meant I was working in a factory. Sorry, it's relevant at the moment.
[1636.25s -> 1644.82s]  What did the factory make? Elves. Okay. Merry Christmas.
[1644.82s -> 1649.54s]  It sure is. So the snowball melts. Should I throw a snowball in the elf's face?
[1649.54s -> 1652.82s]  Or should I compact up a baseball snowball, throw it into the window, and
[1652.82s -> 1659.08s]  hit Santa right in the mouth? Okay, we got a lot of things to look at
[1659.08s -> 1666.33s]  here. Hold on. Trampoline. Max, get on the trampoline.
[1666.33s -> 1673.77s]  We do? Not really. All right. We've got better things to do than jump
[1673.77s -> 1679.67s]  around on a trampoline. Okay, so the gift dispenser. This tube
[1679.67s -> 1683.43s]  spits out presents. Hey, it's just like me. I wouldn't
[1683.43s -> 1686.39s]  call those presents, Max. It's a high score. I can put it with
[1686.39s -> 1692.49s]  high score. This must be what Santa uses to send presents.
[1692.49s -> 1697.80s]  Cougar in a box. Footbath and piranha aquarium.
[1697.80s -> 1701.94s]  That's what he sent to us. Grandma's happy pills.
[1701.94s -> 1715.11s]  My first Moai head. Santa exclusive. Obsess-o-matic stopwatch.
[1715.11s -> 1722.42s]  Uh, footbath and piranha aquarium. Just scoop them out.
[1722.42s -> 1726.74s]  Oh, now we just need to attach a gift tag. Attach a gift tag?
[1726.82s -> 1730.42s]  Look. I gotta find out what people want for Christmas. Perfect.
[1730.42s -> 1734.02s]  I've had a hard time lately getting people to open packages that say
[1734.02s -> 1737.62s]  from Max on them. So who should this go to? You don't have yourself to blame for that.
[1737.62s -> 1760.36s]  It was worth it. Okay, I just wanted to take a bite of a sandwich, but I just
[1760.36s -> 1762.84s]  realized that sounded like somebody came up behind me
[1762.84s -> 1772.22s]  and like put like a fucking covered my mouth and like dragged me away.
[1772.22s -> 1782.07s]  Then I'm gone. Okay, we got the gift tags.
[1782.55s -> 1787.74s]  Let me see. Hold on. Who's it for? No one. Actually, I can't think of-
[1787.74s -> 1800.89s]  It's for me. Oops. All right, so I have gift tags. I can put them on the presents.
[1800.89s -> 1810.02s]  There's a switch too. That turns- All right, so hold on.
[1810.02s -> 1815.16s]  Let's stop it right here and then Max jump on the trampoline
[1815.16s -> 1822.22s]  and get the coin, the star, whatever it is. Go for it, Max.
[1822.22s -> 1829.69s]  Get it. What the hell? It's a toy bomber.
[1829.69s -> 1832.97s]  Or a real bomber that just takes tiny warheads.
[1832.97s -> 1836.01s]  Makes me wish we still had that box of tiny warheads.
[1836.01s -> 1839.93s]  Not me. So I can't jump on that? That was our best fishing trip ever.
[1839.93s -> 1844.44s]  All right, well, slimy crate. What is this gelatinous goo?
[1844.44s -> 1847.96s]  I don't know, but for once I don't find myself wanting to eat it.
[1847.96s -> 1852.44s]  There's a mailing label. To Santa from lower Manitoba.
[1852.44s -> 1856.12s]  And they said Santa never gets gifts. Manitoba.
[1856.12s -> 1863.42s]  Should you get chicken tenders? Absolutely, get them.
[1863.42s -> 1868.50s]  I wonder why they call this the Flounder Pounder.
[1868.50s -> 1875.75s]  So you can shoot tennis balls out. Don't get ten- Why not?
[1875.75s -> 1878.95s]  That's fine. Just don't- Just get chicken tenders and get like honey
[1878.95s -> 1882.47s]  mustard sauce. I don't know. The bop buddy pre-adolescent
[1882.47s -> 1885.35s]  aggression management system. German would never say to get
[1885.35s -> 1889.67s]  tenders. Somebody just said should I get tenders and I'm like yeah.
[1889.67s -> 1896.52s]  It's the world's simplest maze. What's the big deal?
[1896.60s -> 1900.68s]  All mazes are simple. Not everybody has your knack for lateral sinking and heavy
[1900.68s -> 1906.26s]  ordnance, Max. This is not fake. Why would you say
[1906.26s -> 1912.57s]  something like that? Am I not real enough for you?
[1912.57s -> 1934.79s]  I will try harder. Tendies, right? Okay, world's simplest maze.
[1934.79s -> 1944.98s]  So let me go talk to Santa. Will he shoot at me?
[1944.98s -> 1958.52s]  Sugar in water. More, more, more. All right, come on. Give me
[1958.52s -> 1963.08s]  some intel, Santa. I want intel.
[1963.08s -> 1972.50s]  Hi, we're collecting guns for tots. Care to make a donation?
[1972.50s -> 1977.37s]  No siree. Should I give him the kitty litter box?
[1977.37s -> 1980.65s]  All right, record player. It's Santa's record player. Do you think it still
[1980.65s -> 1982.97s]  works? Since we haven't gone near it yet,
[1982.97s -> 1993.74s]  I assume so. Wait, hold on. Double click to run.
[1993.74s -> 1998.23s]  That doesn't work. He just walks a little faster. All right, cannon. Wait, wait, wait,
[1998.23s -> 2000.39s]  wait. We're gonna have to do like a Rube Goldberg machine here.
[2000.39s -> 2003.99s]  It's one of those infinitely reloading cannons. Is it loaded?
[2003.99s -> 2010.62s]  Well, yes. It even has the easy light wick.
[2010.62s -> 2014.78s]  Toy Marie Antoinette sold separately. Okay,
[2014.78s -> 2018.70s]  so what put the other half? We're trying to talk to Santa. You know him?
[2018.70s -> 2021.98s]  Oh sure, he's the one who put me in charge here.
[2021.98s -> 2025.34s]  Was that before or after he went crazy? I'm not sure.
[2025.34s -> 2029.26s]  When someone offers me a promotion, I don't ask a lot of questions.
[2029.26s -> 2038.06s]  That's a soda popper. Santa fired them to stay competitive with the other major
[2038.06s -> 2041.50s]  holidays. We had to outsource our gift manufacturing.
[2041.50s -> 2046.30s]  How'd the elves take it? They all got together and sang a farewell song.
[2046.30s -> 2049.74s]  Oh, that's sweet. You didn't hear the song.
[2049.74s -> 2055.42s]  Let's just say it wasn't very Christmasy. No, no more songs. No more Christmas songs.
[2055.42s -> 2058.94s]  What's it like being here? What's it like living at the North Pole? I wouldn't know.
[2058.94s -> 2065.78s]  I commute. Okay, okay we'll buy. Merry Christmas. Don't remind me. If we don't
[2065.78s -> 2069.94s]  deal with Santa soon, we'll never make our shipping date.
[2069.94s -> 2073.70s]  All right, so what about Boxing Betty? It's a Boxing Betty doll.
[2073.70s -> 2078.26s]  The finest in remote control fisticops. Didn't the Mame-tron teach us
[2078.26s -> 2081.46s]  anything about the dangers of playing with violent robots?
[2081.46s -> 2086.10s]  No, I didn't learn anything. Good, I worry sometimes.
[2086.10s -> 2090.74s]  Okay, well I have Boxing Betty. Boxing Betty, simple maze,
[2090.74s -> 2096.92s]  gift tags, gun. It just wouldn't feel like Christmas without the needless
[2096.92s -> 2104.42s]  destruction of an innocent bystander. Can I put like Boxing Betty on the
[2104.42s -> 2108.62s]  trampoline and launch Boxing Betty up into the
[2108.62s -> 2111.85s]  atmosphere?
[2112.81s -> 2117.14s]  I wonder what the elves have on their office computer. Oh, let's read
[2117.14s -> 2120.50s]  their email. It's a high score list for Minesweeper.
[2120.50s -> 2124.98s]  Let's see. Prancer, Wiggles, Shambling corporate presents.
[2124.98s -> 2128.26s]  How'd that get there? Well, pretty soon it's gonna be all
[2128.26s -> 2132.10s]  max. Now how do I start a new game? Sorry, I think it's
[2132.10s -> 2136.50s]  frozen. Torture? What does that say? Icey arctic wasteland. Hold on, what does that mean?
[2136.50s -> 2143.88s]  I need to see it. There's a, there's a torture thing over here.
[2143.88s -> 2151.74s]  Torture me Elmer, product testing. It's a torture me Elmer doll. Look, he comes
[2151.74s -> 2158.23s]  with his own breakable spirit and detachable retinas. What the
[2158.23s -> 2165.90s]  fuck? Seeing all these toys kind of makes me wish I was a kid again.
[2165.90s -> 2169.26s]  If it's any consolation, I still think of you as a child.
[2169.26s -> 2197.56s]  Thanks, I wish the courts did. No, you can only do that for three
[2197.56s -> 2204.38s]  seconds before people start to leave. All right, we got uh. Hi guys. Let me
[2204.38s -> 2219.32s]  check, wait, wait, wait. See you later guys. Did we do this to him?
[2219.32s -> 2226.42s]  It's a topiary planted in a tiny clay pot.
[2226.42s -> 2230.87s]  You guys, you guys are the, I think you guys might be the villains here.
[2230.87s -> 2235.27s]  This must be Santa's sleigh. Where does he attach the flying reindeer?
[2235.27s -> 2239.59s]  There's a boiler on the back. Whoa, tough break for the reindeer.
[2239.59s -> 2244.18s]  Wait, I want to, before you don't leave yet, let me see what this
[2244.26s -> 2248.58s]  out of you as a child. Thanks, I wish the courts did.
[2248.58s -> 2261.42s]  All right, that's fucked up. All right, I'll give that to you. That's fucked up.
[2261.42s -> 2271.66s]  Santa's coal-powered sleigh. Sleigh. Where are the reindeer? Whoa, you
[2271.66s -> 2274.89s]  actually can run. You guys weren't lying. I can
[2274.89s -> 2278.41s]  snowball. Let's think about the snowball. Boxing Betty.
[2278.41s -> 2287.02s]  Gift. Tags. Snowball. Um, let's see snowball.
[2287.10s -> 2290.86s]  Again and head. Baseball throw into dude's face.
[2294.20s -> 2305.45s]  Didn't even break. The co-op Jupiters are really good today.
[2305.45s -> 2316.07s]  They tend to be. All right, what about Santa? Throw it at Santa?
[2316.07s -> 2319.35s]  It's a bot. Oh no, no, it better not be.
[2319.35s -> 2325.29s]  I don't like to hear that. No, they teach you how to dodge snowballs on
[2325.29s -> 2333.13s]  day one of elf orientation. Should I shoot back at Santa?
[2333.13s -> 2335.37s]  I feel like there's an elaborate puzzle here that I need to be thinking
[2335.37s -> 2342.10s]  of rather than throw snowballs at people. I think I'll save my gun.
[2342.10s -> 2362.25s]  North pole. Okay, all right. Well, let's just leave.
[2362.25s -> 2367.21s]  Use Max on the torture rack. No. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2367.21s -> 2369.77s]  Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Can I actually shoot
[2369.77s -> 2383.85s]  the cannon? I'm not going to do that. Whoa,
[2383.85s -> 2388.15s]  because that line, I lined it up with the, what's not lined up anymore?
[2388.15s -> 2398.09s]  It should be, right? So can I put it right in front of it? Like right
[2398.09s -> 2402.70s]  here? No. I need to shoot the toy bomber.
[2402.70s -> 2411.45s]  It's very obvious. No, you can only stop it here.
[2411.45s -> 2420.84s]  I can't stop it anywhere else. How is it obvious? Well, I mean, I have to
[2420.84s -> 2427.70s]  move it and then get it right. Okay, it doesn't work.
[2427.70s -> 2431.06s]  What happened to Santa? I don't know, but if you ask me,
[2431.06s -> 2434.18s]  it was only a matter of time before he snapped.
[2434.18s -> 2438.02s]  He's always been a little crazy. He has?
[2438.02s -> 2442.10s]  Think about it. The man gives presents away for free.
[2442.10s -> 2446.26s]  I always assumed he did it for the tax write-off.
[2448.33s -> 2453.16s]  Ah, that's right, right. Oh, that's a good humor right there. Who manufactures
[2453.16s -> 2455.88s]  the toys now? It's all been moved off site, so
[2455.88s -> 2463.53s]  officially speaking, I have no idea. What about unofficially? Baby penguins.
[2463.53s -> 2467.29s]  Why on earth would you use baby penguins? The adults refuse to work
[2467.29s -> 2471.77s]  without a health plan. Santa paid more in taxes in 2018
[2471.77s -> 2474.57s]  than Amazon.
[2475.35s -> 2479.35s]  I mean, think about that. That is a funny joke. Santa is operating at such a
[2479.35s -> 2484.63s]  massive loss. Oh, the elves make the toys, but
[2484.63s -> 2487.91s]  Santa, buddy, I gotta have payroll. They're probably, and he's gotta give
[2487.91s -> 2492.15s]  toys to literally everybody on earth. That's the thing. That's the lore,
[2492.15s -> 2494.49s]  right? You just wake up and there's a bunch
[2494.49s -> 2498.58s]  of fucking shit expensive stuff under your tree to
[2498.58s -> 2503.10s]  millions and millions of families. Santa is operating at like a 40 to 50
[2503.10s -> 2507.10s]  billion dollar loss every year. I don't know, where's he getting the
[2507.10s -> 2511.82s]  money? Who is like leveraging and insuring Santa
[2511.82s -> 2519.02s]  Claus? He might not even be real. I mean, I
[2519.02s -> 2520.94s]  don't know where the presents come from. I just assumed
[2520.94s -> 2524.78s]  that they just, they just were kind of, he did it. I don't know, he might
[2524.78s -> 2530.23s]  not be real. That's kind of weird to think about.
[2530.23s -> 2534.47s]  Wait, if it's like 50 to 100 billion dollars a year and nobody pays it,
[2534.47s -> 2539.53s]  but what about the guy that's at the mall? There's a person, there's a
[2539.53s -> 2542.94s]  guy, I guess you could just, you could dress
[2542.94s -> 2552.20s]  up as that guy, but they say it's him. It could be an actor.
[2552.20s -> 2559.77s]  Merry Christmas. If you say so. Fuck. No, but then how,
[2559.77s -> 2565.61s]  then where did I get my stuff? When I was like,
[2565.61s -> 2575.24s]  parents might have done it. I gotta take a,
[2575.24s -> 2581.74s]  I gotta take a quick break after this. I'm just gonna make a couple phone
[2581.74s -> 2590.09s]  calls. Where to, Sam? On second thought, let's just stay here.
[2590.09s -> 2593.69s]  Kind of, my whole world's kind of crumbling on me right now.
[2593.69s -> 2599.94s]  Trying to figure out what the fuck is going on here. I can't leave!
[2599.94s -> 2603.06s]  Where to, Sam? On second thought, let's just stay here.
[2603.06s -> 2608.39s]  Okay, well I have to figure this out. Simplest maze. Max, come here.
[2608.39s -> 2613.13s]  Can you do this? When one of the soda poppers touches this?
[2613.13s -> 2617.43s]  Then they try to give me something I didn't want. Give me a snowball.
[2617.43s -> 2624.60s]  Let's try throwing snowballs and stuff. I didn't do shit, don't stop
[2624.60s -> 2639.38s]  saying that. Throw a snowball at me. Baby
[2639.38s -> 2641.06s]  penguins. Do penguins do good work?
[2641.06s -> 2644.90s]  Sure, if you don't mind toys that have a slightly fishy smell.
[2644.90s -> 2649.06s]  Giving them or receiving them? You can use the gift tube over there and see
[2649.06s -> 2651.46s]  for yourself. Gift tube, we already clicked on it.
[2651.46s -> 2654.26s]  Okay, we want to talk to Sam. We've already done this.
[2654.26s -> 2657.62s]  I don't think talking is going to do any good.
[2657.62s -> 2661.94s]  All he wants to do is shoot everything. That's understandable.
[2661.94s -> 2665.06s]  You gotta get his gun away from him or he's gonna make us do
[2665.06s -> 2668.90s]  bad things. Get the gun away. Merry Christmas.
[2668.98s -> 2671.62s]  Don't remind me if we don't deal with Santa.
[2671.62s -> 2675.02s]  Yep, all right. What about you? You have anything else to say?
[2675.02s -> 2678.38s]  What are you doing? So what do you do here? I'm supposed to make this tree
[2678.38s -> 2682.30s]  grow. Oh. By crying. Christmas trees love
[2682.30s -> 2687.66s]  elf tears. Heck, who doesn't? It makes them grow up big and fast.
[2687.66s -> 2691.50s]  But I'm too darn happy. I'll never be able to cry.
[2691.50s -> 2694.30s]  So we gotta make him cry. It's enough to make you cry.
[2694.30s -> 2699.21s]  I wish. Throw a snowball at his face. I bet we could make you cry.
[2699.21s -> 2703.21s]  Thanks. I've been trying to cry but I'm just too darn happy.
[2703.21s -> 2706.73s]  We can fix that. In fact, that's about the only thing we can fix.
[2706.73s -> 2711.45s]  If you want to make me cry, go ahead. We want to. We want to.
[2711.45s -> 2716.01s]  Me first. Okay, wait, wait, wait. We killed your dog. I'll feed you to a
[2716.01s -> 2720.49s]  polar bear. I'll rip your eyes out. You were adopted. Santa isn't real.
[2720.49s -> 2724.49s]  You're fired. I give up. All right, hold on. Should we drop this
[2724.49s -> 2728.33s]  absolute bombshell on him? You don't still believe in Santa Claus, do you?
[2728.33s -> 2732.65s]  Sure I do. I saw him this morning. Well, I hate to be the one to break it to you
[2732.65s -> 2736.57s]  but Santa isn't real. He's just make believe.
[2736.57s -> 2740.97s]  Like the black Easter bunny or elves. But I'm an elf.
[2740.97s -> 2745.93s]  That's what makes this so hard. Wait a second. Are you saying I don't exist?
[2745.93s -> 2749.05s]  I got him. Can you prove that you exist? Well, sure. Got him.
[2749.05s -> 2753.64s]  I mean, no, I guess I can't. Got him.
[2753.64s -> 2764.44s]  Ouch, tough break. Surprise, we were lying. Congratulations, you exist.
[2764.44s -> 2770.18s]  Nice try, but I don't believe in you either.
[2770.18s -> 2777.62s]  Grow? Excellent. Hey, my snowball melted.
[2777.62s -> 2781.54s]  All right, so now it's bigger. That's a big honking tree.
[2781.54s -> 2786.66s]  Those elf tears really work. So now,
[2786.66s -> 2793.13s]  uh, is this gonna bump into the tree?
[2793.13s -> 2797.21s]  No, I thought it could have, like, stopped at a bump into one or something. I don't know, dude.
[2797.21s -> 2800.73s]  Um, all right, cannon. But let me, hold on.
[2800.73s -> 2825.00s]  There's a demon at the top of the tree. Yeah, there it is. All right, so we can throw
[2825.00s -> 2830.28s]  snowball at, give me this. Well, I can't believe he filled up the entire can.
[2830.28s -> 2834.84s]  Yeah, we must have really terrified the poor guy. Good work, little buddy.
[2834.84s -> 2839.80s]  Oh, stop. Now you're gonna make me cry. He shat the line, little buddy.
[2839.88s -> 2844.18s]  All right, let's throw snowball at cannon.
[2844.18s -> 2847.62s]  The cannon's already loaded. No, snowball.
[2847.62s -> 2852.71s]  He's already cried. There's this thing, snowball
[2852.71s -> 2857.99s]  into this thing. I think I'll save my snowball for a more satisfying target.
[2857.99s -> 2869.82s]  Okay, snowball. No. Can I make something else grow? Can I make the
[2869.82s -> 2875.94s]  trampoline grow? Hey, my snowball. Maybe a bigger
[2875.94s -> 2882.38s]  trampoline? I can't water that. Why not? Wait, do I have any other stuff
[2882.38s -> 2892.20s]  in my office or something? Can I leave now?
[2892.20s -> 2901.59s]  There is something out here. Can we grow? I remember this thing. All right, so that's huge.
[2901.59s -> 2905.43s]  Give me the rest of those elf tears. I've got a date with an unsuspecting
[2905.43s -> 2908.71s]  metropolis. Sorry, little buddy. They only work on
[2908.71s -> 2912.47s]  plants. Only on plants. You win again, Tokyo!
[2912.47s -> 2928.89s]  Giant topiary. I know it's called a topiary.
[2928.89s -> 2936.52s]  So now we're in Santa's room. Merry Christmas!
[2936.52s -> 2940.28s]  We come bearing good cheer and high-powered pistols.
[2940.28s -> 2948.42s]  Chuck-a-bump fairies! Santa, you okay in there?
[2952.66s -> 2957.78s]  Wait, why are we coming down again?
[2958.97s -> 2963.18s]  Okay, so we have to be quiet. Now, let's see here. We've got
[2963.18s -> 2969.48s]  Boxing Betty. Simple maze. That's his aggro zone. Santa's safe.
[2969.48s -> 2979.05s]  Bookshelf photo. Exit. Santa's hat. It's Santa's hat. Do you think it's
[2979.05s -> 2983.21s]  magical? Nope. The tag says it's 100% polyester.
[2983.21s -> 2987.53s]  Wow, that's the exact opposite of magical. I'm not gonna shoot him. That's not the solution.
[2987.53s -> 2994.02s]  Okay, we've got... Grr?
[2999.82s -> 3010.60s]  All right, I'm gonna shoot him now. That was my one shot. That was my one chance.
[3010.60s -> 3013.80s]  I can't shoot Santa Claus. What if I missed?
[3013.80s -> 3017.96s]  That'd just make him even meaner. But don't miss.
[3017.96s -> 3021.86s]  Problem solved. Boxing Betty. All right, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[3021.86s -> 3026.18s]  Wait, what's... Christmas record? Record player?
[3026.18s -> 3029.78s]  Oh, it includes the smash hit, the friendly demon song.
[3029.78s -> 3032.66s]  I can't think of anything to say right now. He'll come up.
[3032.66s -> 3040.12s]  Okay, so record player Parchment. Their exorcism instructions.
[3040.12s -> 3045.40s]  Wicked! I want to do it now! But we don't know anyone who's possessed
[3045.40s -> 3049.40s]  or doing. Possessed. How do we start? Hey kids,
[3049.40s -> 3054.76s]  want to silence those inner voices? Do I? No more messy arcane rituals.
[3054.84s -> 3058.04s]  The My Little Demon playset makes it easy. First,
[3058.04s -> 3061.72s]  signal the emergence of the demon with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
[3061.72s -> 3067.53s]  action figures, sold separately. Ask your parents to help you place the
[3067.53s -> 3070.33s]  horsemen around a powerful magnetic pole.
[3070.33s -> 3074.89s]  Roman Polanski? Finally, draw the hell spawn out by singing the friendly
[3074.89s -> 3077.77s]  demon song, using personal information about your
[3077.77s -> 3084.74s]  demon. He won't be able to resist. Okay, so we need four horsemen.
[3084.74s -> 3091.35s]  We need the four horsemen. Where am I going to get the four horsemen?
[3091.35s -> 3099.83s]  Performance reviews for young children. Well, at least I have the
[3099.83s -> 3103.67s]  record. It's either a trip to the zoo or Santa's gotten remarried.
[3103.67s -> 3106.71s]  Either way, I can't tell what he sees in her.
[3106.71s -> 3110.97s]  Yeah, I think you'd need a wider lens. All right.
[3110.97s -> 3113.85s]  Well, can I put on the coat? I can't touch any of this stuff. I've never
[3113.85s -> 3117.21s]  seen Santa take his coat off before. Now that you mention it, I don't
[3117.21s -> 3119.93s]  think I've ever seen you take your coat off either.
[3119.93s -> 3124.57s]  I haven't. Reindeer? Wait, this is one of the reindeer? It's either
[3124.57s -> 3131.24s]  dasher or dancer. Well, let's just see what we can do now. We
[3131.24s -> 3137.80s]  have a way to get in. So I'm gonna assume we can
[3137.80s -> 3142.79s]  eventually hear. I got the record and exorcism instructions.
[3142.79s -> 3159.72s]  Can I play the record? There's a whole lot of random stuff in here that I
[3159.72s -> 3171.18s]  feel like I'm missing. Naruto? Why you gotta say Naruto?
[3171.26s -> 3182.90s]  Let's put on the friendly demon song.
[3188.10s -> 3196.97s]  What? What? Very scary demon. We had him. Like two ferrets and a dolphin
[3196.97s -> 3203.83s]  stapled together.
[3208.82s -> 3226.18s]  In the bathtub of 94 Honda Civic. I pull the tail off the donkey.
[3226.18s -> 3230.58s]  Hey, nameless one of his homilinkers. Hey, he has a thousand unanswered
[3230.58s -> 3234.42s]  supplies. Hey, Shambling Corporate Presence. Hey,
[3234.42s -> 3239.85s]  Shambling Corporate Presence. I don't think that's how the song goes.
[3239.85s -> 3251.42s]  So we have to, all right. We have uh, what would it,
[3251.42s -> 3258.41s]  who's on here? Who's number one? It's a high score list for Minesweeper.
[3258.41s -> 3261.85s]  Prancer, Wiggles, and the Shambling Corporate Presence.
[3261.85s -> 3272.07s]  Okay, Prancer. So these are all references to stuff in
[3272.15s -> 3280.20s]  the I.K. All right. So let me look at that again.
[3280.20s -> 3283.40s]  It's Santa's record player. It's Santa. Oh, play it.
[3283.40s -> 3295.53s]  Let me just see what those options were again.
[3298.41s -> 3306.86s]  Very scary form. IRS 1040. I mean, that's, didn't they make an IRS
[3306.86s -> 3313.30s]  gelatinous goo? Because that's what's in the box.
[3314.33s -> 3316.33s]  I'm going to say this one.
[3320.52s -> 3327.02s]  Most unholy creature that was ever born. Okay, Manitoba.
[3327.02s -> 3338.26s]  In lower Manitoba. What's on the box? It's like Minesweeper, right? Because the
[3338.26s -> 3349.74s]  computer. Shout his name. Prancer. Oh, shit.
[3349.74s -> 3359.66s]  That's not the, the Corporate Presence didn't win. Is it that?
[3359.66s -> 3365.85s]  That's no, no, no. That's the only, that's the only possible option.
[3365.93s -> 3370.65s]  Oh, the song seemed right. I guess we must not have all the
[3370.65s -> 3373.45s]  horsemen in place. Oh, fuck. I have to have to put them over here.
[3373.45s -> 3377.21s]  I have to have four horsemen. Hey, it's the North Pole,
[3377.21s -> 3380.89s]  the magnetic center of the earth. Well, magnetism.
[3380.89s -> 3385.29s]  Don't tell me you're one of those kooks. You don't believe in magnetism.
[3385.29s -> 3388.33s]  It's an interesting theory, but I'm not convinced.
[3388.33s -> 3392.65s]  Your magnetism is a cute bedtime story, but I believe in one
[3392.65s -> 3399.26s]  thing. Okay, fine. I can't believe this works.
[3399.26s -> 3402.84s]  I believe in two things, but that's my limit.
[3402.84s -> 3409.96s]  Max is a flat earther. All right, so we need four people or four things
[3409.96s -> 3415.70s]  out here. How do we, where the hell does that come into play?
[3415.70s -> 3421.19s]  Is it the soda poppers? It's only three. Who's the fourth?
[3421.19s -> 3431.83s]  Is it Max? Hi, guys. Why don't you go inside?
[3431.83s -> 3435.43s]  We're waiting for the shootout to end. I can respect that.
[3435.43s -> 3441.59s]  How? So I have to stop Santa from doing that. See you later, guys. So they go inside so I
[3441.59s -> 3453.22s]  can teleport them to hell. All right, maybe something with the gifts.
[3453.22s -> 3460.04s]  No, but I don't have it. Can I leave yet? Where to, Sam?
[3460.04s -> 3462.28s]  Okay, I can leave. Let's go back to the office. Let's head back to
[3462.28s -> 3466.28s]  civilization or what's left of it. Good thinking. We can always freeze to
[3466.28s -> 3479.22s]  death out here later. Drive from here to there because I
[3479.22s -> 3481.46s]  couldn't leave before. This is the first time I've been able
[3481.46s -> 3485.70s]  to come back to the town. All right, well hold on. Sibyl's is, is
[3485.70s -> 3488.90s]  Sibyl alive in here? Sibyl's not here. It's closed.
[3488.90s -> 3492.42s]  Open 24 hours unless I don't feel like it.
[3492.42s -> 3497.06s]  Or a giant robot tosses the entire building a city block.
[3497.06s -> 3502.86s]  Poor Sibyl. Sorry, Sibyl. We tried. All right, boss goes for the first time.
[3502.86s -> 3510.79s]  Who's this rat? It's not a clickable rat. New S&M
[3510.79s -> 3513.83s]  season. It's a shame you don't wear collars, Sam.
[3513.83s -> 3517.75s]  It says they're coming back in style. Sam back.
[3517.75s -> 3522.07s]  U.S. to Macroheart Corporation. I wondered why the stock market kept
[3522.07s -> 3525.93s]  crashing. All right, let's go in. How's Bosco
[3525.93s -> 3534.65s]  doing in season two? Welcome to Bosco's
[3534.65s -> 3538.01s]  inconvenience. Please wait while I determine whether
[3538.01s -> 3542.41s]  you are truly welcome or if I am just uttering idle pleasantries.
[3542.41s -> 3545.93s]  Nothing says inconvenience like a full body search before you can buy
[3546.01s -> 3548.17s]  your candy cigarettes and all day suckers.
[3548.17s -> 3553.38s]  You have been deemed not unacceptable. Welcome.
[3553.38s -> 3559.86s]  Bosco, your disguise. It's, it's, it's hideous. Claw my eyes out, Sam. I can't
[3559.86s -> 3563.38s]  bear to look at it. Not if I claw my own eyes out first.
[3563.38s -> 3566.90s]  He's not going to be in a costume. I'm not wearing a disguise.
[3566.90s -> 3572.02s]  I know comedy. I forgot how ugly you were without a wig or hat or something.
[3572.02s -> 3580.41s]  My package. All right, so what, uh, what, what package? Say Bosco, what's in the-
[3580.41s -> 3583.77s]  Hey guys, does my package sound like it's ticking to you?
[3583.77s -> 3587.29s]  Not your best pickup line, Bosco. Oh, I don't know.
[3587.29s -> 3591.05s]  I think my package is the bomb. Now that's
[3591.05s -> 3598.17s]  a pickup line. Okay. Keep going. Who would send you a bomb?
[3598.17s -> 3602.41s]  My mother, of course. She sends me one every year around this time.
[3602.41s -> 3606.41s]  What the? Families need traditions. So why don't you just get rid of it?
[3606.41s -> 3610.25s]  I built that bomb disposal unit for that very purpose.
[3610.25s -> 3615.69s]  So why don't you just get rid of it? Because it might be the billion dollar
[3615.69s -> 3622.01s]  plunger I just ordered. What a dilemma. Billion dollar. Just open it. Just open
[3622.01s -> 3625.61s]  your package, Bosco. What if it's the bomb? I thought I
[3625.61s -> 3630.63s]  heard ticket. Just get rid of your package, Bosco.
[3630.63s -> 3635.45s]  Forehead. But what if it's my plunger? I gotta be sure it's ticket.
[3635.45s -> 3640.10s]  Just open your package, Bosco. Just get rid of your package, Bosco.
[3640.10s -> 3644.30s]  But what- Just open your package, Bosco.
[3644.30s -> 3654.68s]  Just get rid of your package, Bosco. That's-
[3654.68s -> 3666.04s]  that's the shit I gotta deal with on a day-to-day basis.
[3666.04s -> 3670.04s]  I know what it's like. Why not disguise it?
[3670.04s -> 3673.72s]  No hilariously inadequate disguise this time? Sam, Sam, Sam, you
[3673.72s -> 3679.40s]  poor naive fool. Don't you realize the time for disguises is past?
[3679.40s -> 3682.84s]  Yeah, you poor naive fool. Don't you realize that?
[3682.84s -> 3686.84s]  Quiet, head knuckle. A disguise could never protect you from
[3686.84s -> 3696.04s]  T-H-E-M. Them. You scared me. Who's them?
[3696.04s -> 3699.48s]  That's exactly what I'm trying to figure out. I'm watching,
[3699.48s -> 3703.88s]  I'm listening, and I will find T-H-E-M.
[3703.88s -> 3710.66s]  Well, if you do, tell them- Okay, this is getting old fast.
[3710.66s -> 3721.51s]  Them. Them. That's great, I love it. Just open your package, Bosco.
[3721.51s -> 3726.95s]  What- Them. Just get rid of your package, Bosco.
[3726.95s -> 3733.16s]  But what if it- Them. Welcome to every German 985 stream.
[3733.16s -> 3739.22s]  Just open- Them. Just get rid of your package, Bosco.
[3739.22s -> 3754.46s]  But what if- Them. Oh, shit!
[3756.98s -> 3763.32s]  I don't do that, though. I don't do that. I can't do that.
[3763.32s -> 3767.16s]  What's with your store? I'm not sure if you noticed, but this ain't-
[3767.16s -> 3771.86s]  Jokes do always go wrong. I haven't noticed anything.
[3771.86s -> 3775.62s]  Look, I've got a hundred trillion dollars and a thousand faceless
[3775.62s -> 3779.78s]  enemies. I don't need to sell anything. Then why keep the place open?
[3779.78s -> 3784.73s]  I'm a people person. You would if you could. No, I would not.
[3784.73s -> 3789.37s]  I love you guys, you guys are great. You think I would ever do that?
[3789.37s -> 3793.45s]  Okay, what's the door scanner? What's with the fancy dance scanner, Bosco?
[3793.45s -> 3797.77s]  Tools are necessary. Tools are the only things that separate us from the
[3797.77s -> 3800.41s]  animals. That probably plays a little better
[3800.41s -> 3804.25s]  with the non-dog and rabbit ground. That's why I need the personal
[3804.33s -> 3808.09s]  antipathy registration annulment and non-negational
[3808.09s -> 3812.65s]  omnifunctional identification device. That's just paranoid.
[3812.65s -> 3817.13s]  Technically, yes it is. Okay, oh here we got another one of these.
[3817.13s -> 3820.89s]  Do you have any bulletproof edible underwear? I don't have
[3820.89s -> 3824.25s]  anything. This ain't a store. It's not a store anymore.
[3824.25s -> 3827.45s]  Do you have any lords of leaping and or maids of milking?
[3827.45s -> 3831.61s]  I told you this ain't a store. I'm gonna get punched.
[3831.61s -> 3835.29s]  Do you have any inflatable arms capable of being used as replacements for your
[3835.29s -> 3839.05s]  real arms? Didn't I just tell you this ain't a store
[3839.05s -> 3843.59s]  no more? Do you have any passive aggressive
[3843.59s -> 3846.79s]  payback disguised as an innocuous customer inquiry?
[3846.79s -> 3853.67s]  Punch. Do you have any- No! This ain't a store!
[3853.67s -> 3858.86s]  It's not? No! Oh, why didn't you say so?
[3858.86s -> 3862.46s]  A trillion dollars worth of detection equipment and yet he still didn't see
[3862.46s -> 3869.03s]  that one coming a mile away. Now the store looks interesting.
[3869.03s -> 3872.79s]  It ain't a store no more. And did you know people who say that-
[3872.79s -> 3876.39s]  Wow, I'm being a real asshole. Are more likely to be serial killers?
[3876.39s -> 3879.75s]  More likely than who? Than non-serial killers.
[3879.75s -> 3883.11s]  It's a fact. A fact they don't want you to know.
[3883.11s -> 3889.16s]  Who doesn't want me to know? Exactly.
[3889.16s -> 3892.44s]  Hold on. My regards to your decorator. I like this. Yeah, what's the style?
[3892.52s -> 3897.88s]  Early colonial conspiracy theorist? No, a theorist is somebody who has a theory.
[3897.88s -> 3903.08s]  I have conspiracy facts. So I guess you'd be a conspiracy factist.
[3903.08s -> 3907.48s]  He's certainly not a cluist. Conspiracy factist.
[3907.48s -> 3913.08s]  Because he doesn't have a clue. Yeah, I got it.
[3913.08s -> 3916.04s]  All right. Enough about your store. It's not a-
[3916.12s -> 3923.06s]  Oh, forget it. Just open your package, Bosco.
[3923.06s -> 3925.78s]  See ya, Bosco.
[3926.74s -> 3931.08s]  All right. Bomb be gone. Can we borrow your bomb be gone?
[3931.08s -> 3934.36s]  There's some obsolete landmines around the office we need to get rid of.
[3934.36s -> 3937.72s]  No. If I loaned my bomb disposal unit out to everyone in the
[3937.72s -> 3940.28s]  neighborhood who needed it, I'd never get it back.
[3940.28s -> 3944.28s]  You know, in this neighborhood that's actually true.
[3944.28s -> 3948.41s]  X-ray machine. So it's not a store. It really isn't.
[3948.41s -> 3954.38s]  Theory of everything. Suddenly, it all makes sense.
[3954.38s -> 3957.02s]  I can't see where we fit into all this, Sam.
[3957.02s -> 3964.14s]  Oh, I've got a couple of walls upstairs devoted to YouTube.
[3964.14s -> 3967.02s]  That's not the shit that he made. That's not the stuff that he
[3967.02s -> 3970.54s]  researched. All right, X-ray machine. Hey, an X-ray machine.
[3970.54s -> 3975.56s]  Don't fool with that. X-ray boxing bag.
[3975.56s -> 3980.97s]  Don't fool with that. X-ray... What about these?
[3980.97s -> 3983.77s]  To exorcise the demon, it says we'll need to
[3983.85s -> 3987.13s]  collect the four horsemen of the apocalypse action figures. Place the
[3987.13s -> 3990.57s]  horsemen around a magnetic pole and draw the demon out using the
[3990.57s -> 3994.17s]  friendly demon stone. We just need the four horsemen.
[3994.17s -> 3999.77s]  Enlarger. I wonder if we can enlarge anything else.
[3999.77s -> 4009.05s]  No, Max. No. Okay, if the tears make things grow,
[4009.05s -> 4013.24s]  I'm not gonna say it because that's an easy
[4013.24s -> 4020.44s]  low-hanging fruit. Fill in the blank. All right, so
[4020.44s -> 4033.19s]  I'm not, let me go check the other stuff. Wait, this is open?
[4033.19s -> 4038.14s]  Stinky's Diner is open. Stinky's Diner.
[4038.14s -> 4040.78s]  It's back in business. We're gonna, a new character? An excited neighborhood
[4040.78s -> 4046.78s]  reopens its arms and its emergency rooms. Stinky's
[4046.78s -> 4050.06s]  Diner. I'm excited for a new character. Ah, the
[4050.06s -> 4054.06s]  smell of desiccated eggs, congealing bacon fat and rye bread gone
[4054.06s -> 4056.54s]  awry. It's like Stinky's Diner never
[4056.58s -> 4062.94s]  closed. Welcome to Stinky's. We never close except when we're closed.
[4062.94s -> 4066.94s]  Who are you? Is it Stinky? I'm Stinky. The Stinky we know was a
[4066.94s -> 4070.86s]  cantankerous old man who transformed his seething hatred of humanity into a
[4070.86s -> 4073.98s]  misanthropic smorgasbord of culinary horrors.
[4073.98s -> 4078.30s]  That does sound like grandpa. Okay, we're ready for the next round of
[4078.30s -> 4081.18s]  trivia and the question is... They're alive!
[4081.82s -> 4083.82s]  They're alive!
[4092.38s -> 4098.42s]  Bangers and match. Do I get the answer?
[4098.42s -> 4108.07s]  I can't. Okay, alpha horn. Bug. Oh wait, it's a bug.
[4117.51s -> 4130.55s]  I've got two people living in there.
[4131.11s -> 4136.98s]  Why'd you play back that demon recording? I've got a case of PISD,
[4136.98s -> 4141.70s]  post insecticide stress disorder. It keeps causing these flashbacks.
[4141.70s -> 4145.86s]  How so? I get a whiff of something familiar and the memories just come
[4145.86s -> 4148.42s]  rushing back. All right, so you get a smell. Must have been some brimstone in the
[4148.42s -> 4151.38s]  air during that exorcism. Oh, was that brimstone?
[4151.38s -> 4154.66s]  This whole time I just assumed you let out a 200 pound fart.
[4154.66s -> 4163.13s]  No, it was brimstone, honest. Okay. You don't get along with your family?
[4163.13s -> 4167.69s]  Negative. Except for my dad. They're all a bunch of spineless ladybugs.
[4167.69s -> 4170.89s]  Aren't all bugs spineless? Not in my regiment.
[4170.89s -> 4174.89s]  If you didn't have a spine, by god, my dad would make you grow a pair.
[4174.89s -> 4178.25s]  A pair of spines? That's just the kind of bug he was.
[4178.25s -> 4182.41s]  Oh, I forgot about the dream. Like, I had a dream last night.
[4182.41s -> 4186.04s]  This is important. Really important. Pause this for a second.
[4186.04s -> 4190.20s]  I actually can pause this. So listen to this shit. So last night I had a
[4190.20s -> 4195.16s]  dream, and this is, it was too real. So I had a dream. You know how people
[4195.16s -> 4199.50s]  have dreams about me streaming? They say, dude, I was having this
[4199.50s -> 4202.70s]  dream, you're streaming it, you got sucked up, the gray fluid went into
[4202.70s -> 4206.78s]  your brain, and then I... So I was having a dream that I was
[4206.78s -> 4211.35s]  streaming. And I turned on the webcam. I don't
[4211.35s -> 4213.43s]  know what game I was playing, what didn't matter, but that was about, I
[4213.43s -> 4216.47s]  was gonna do like a joke that I thought was gonna be funny.
[4216.47s -> 4219.67s]  And everyone was like, oh, joke incoming, joke incoming,
[4219.67s -> 4224.94s]  webcam's on, and I was like, I didn't have anything. I had nothing.
[4224.94s -> 4227.74s]  So I was like, oh fuck, I gotta think of something funny to do quick,
[4227.74s -> 4230.94s]  because I didn't, I don't like have a joke ready. And I like did the turn on
[4230.94s -> 4234.15s]  the webcam thing. So I just started going like this. I
[4234.15s -> 4238.07s]  started punching towards the camera, and every time I would punch, I was
[4238.07s -> 4243.10s]  going, I'm gonna get you guys with some karate!
[4243.10s -> 4246.46s]  And it was like minus twos, and people would just like, I did it like
[4246.46s -> 4251.64s]  four or five times in a row. And I remember right when I stopped
[4251.64s -> 4254.52s]  doing it, I was like that, this was not even funny,
[4254.52s -> 4258.28s]  that was not even, that was horrible. And I was like, I'm just like kidding, I
[4258.28s -> 4262.92s]  turned off the webcam, and I was still asleep. And I went
[4262.92s -> 4267.06s]  through the rest of my night, walking around like eating, I just
[4267.06s -> 4270.18s]  have these vague weird flashes of me lying in my bed,
[4270.18s -> 4273.80s]  being like, fuck, that like, that really, that joke really sucked.
[4273.80s -> 4276.52s]  Ah, it's all right, like I'll come back tomorrow and like do something funny,
[4276.52s -> 4284.76s]  and then I woke up. That was yesterday.
[4288.49s -> 4296.55s]  Imagine if this actually happened.
[4297.67s -> 4301.03s]  I'm so fucked up, and like delirious, and so
[4301.03s -> 4304.23s]  scatterbrained, that I don't even remember what I did yesterday,
[4304.23s -> 4315.37s]  and I thought it was a dream. He doesn't remember it.
[4315.37s -> 4332.66s]  He's not even funny in his dreams! No, I'm not. Here we go, let's go.
[4332.66s -> 4336.34s]  I just, that makes it even funnier in my brain, that like this actually
[4336.34s -> 4344.68s]  happened. And I thought it was, I don't have any
[4344.68s -> 4351.80s]  clothes on, I can't turn my webcam on. I was like, punch, punch, punch, I call
[4351.80s -> 4356.36s]  raw tea to you guys! And people hated it. That didn't happen
[4356.36s -> 4364.82s]  yesterday. No, stop fucking with my head! No,
[4364.82s -> 4370.66s]  no, this is not like time travel, guys. I don't have to like redo the
[4370.66s -> 4373.86s]  thing that I did to keep the timeline going correctly.
[4373.86s -> 4380.36s]  What do you mean we have the clip? What are you linking?
[4380.36s -> 4391.00s]  Hold on. No, it's not the slap. What is that, what,
[4391.00s -> 4406.94s]  Effectator, what are you linking here? This, what is this?
[4406.94s -> 4413.88s]  I missed my cue! Oh, wait, you already did this?
[4413.88s -> 4421.99s]  Wait, what is this one? Wait, how did you get this already?
[4421.99s -> 4430.70s]  Oh, here comes a joke. Karate! Oh, I already hate it. Not the video, but
[4430.70s -> 4443.10s]  hold on. I missed my cue! Well, hold on.
[4443.10s -> 4454.30s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, I took a bite out of a sandwich.
[4454.30s -> 4461.99s]  God damn it. Don't, I can't restart it. God damn, that was a perfect
[4461.99s -> 4466.23s]  opportunity. I took a bite out of my sandwich. I
[4466.23s -> 4470.74s]  have a sandwich over here. Hold on. I was gonna, I was gonna go
[4470.74s -> 4475.70s]  like this. It's too late now, but just add it.
[4475.70s -> 4478.18s]  Add it. Somebody add it to the end of that. I know something's gonna fucking
[4478.18s -> 4484.38s]  clip it or something, but add this.
[4494.94s -> 4510.42s]  That was not what I did. That was not even close to what I did.
[4510.42s -> 4518.31s]  All right, let me play the game. Recreate the karate joke!
[4518.31s -> 4521.99s]  No! I, hold on, let me put on like a blanket.
[4525.82s -> 4530.44s]  Bag on my body. I need a shirt. Hair. This is fine.
[4530.44s -> 4541.19s]  Will this cover enough? Yeah, no, this is fine. This, this will cover it up.
[4541.19s -> 4548.86s]  This is essentially wearing a shirt. Is it? I need to look.
[4548.86s -> 4551.58s]  I need to see where the camera is, because this, I, this is a, this
[4551.58s -> 4574.28s]  functions as a t-shirt. Yeah, we're good. Oh, we're good.
[4574.28s -> 4583.83s]  Okay. Yeah, this functions as a t-shirt. Okay.
[4583.83s -> 4590.47s]  So I said, hey, it's time for some karate!
[4590.47s -> 4613.88s]  That's what I did. And that's like a SpongeBob thing, right?
[4613.88s -> 4620.73s]  Oh no, I'm looking over it. I'm seeing it. You know, here's the really fucked
[4620.73s -> 4626.90s]  up part about this whole thing. I'm living right now the dream that I
[4626.90s -> 4631.88s]  had last night. That's, I had to correct, there's some
[4631.88s -> 4637.69s]  weird like time thing where I had to do that. I just
[4637.69s -> 4642.84s]  probably, I just like saved all the, all the whole universe by doing
[4642.84s -> 4655.11s]  what I just did. For some reason I had to do that. I
[4655.11s -> 4662.25s]  had to help, somehow. I don't know how. Is it the same armor from the day the,
[4662.25s -> 4670.55s]  yes it is. It was just in the closet and I knew I could use it as a shirt.
[4670.55s -> 4672.95s]  Sometimes you gotta think about that. Like, why did I have that dream in the
[4672.95s -> 4677.67s]  first place? It was because they, like they knew
[4677.67s -> 4680.63s]  that I was gonna have to do this. And I, that second, somebody was
[4680.63s -> 4683.51s]  watching the stream and like I had to stall here for a second for some
[4683.51s -> 4686.39s]  reason. Because that made them pay attention
[4686.39s -> 4689.83s]  for some reason. Because they're gonna go on to be like a
[4689.83s -> 4693.59s]  scientist. And they, right after fucking watching that clip they,
[4693.59s -> 4697.83s]  they thought of something to write down or at that moment they picked up their
[4697.83s -> 4701.85s]  career path. And then you go on and you like cure
[4701.85s -> 4706.94s]  every illness. Because of just the way that the time
[4706.94s -> 4711.54s]  that had that had happened for a reason. Santa isn't fucking real.
[4711.54s -> 4714.58s]  Figure it out. All right, when did you start, where are we?
[4723.22s -> 4734.26s]  I gotta get a good career.
[4734.26s -> 4738.02s]  I gotta get a good career so I'm not a guy in my 30s
[4738.02s -> 4746.33s]  punching into a camera with a child's hockey chest pad on. You know,
[4746.33s -> 4752.84s]  however we do it, we do it. However we do it, we do it guys.
[4752.84s -> 4754.87s]  Right?
[4757.83s -> 4770.97s]  It's D.
[4770.97s -> 4778.97s]  We think it's D. Wait, what was, oh fuck, wait.
[4778.97s -> 4789.10s]  Hey, you okay? Hey, you okay, man? Was it D?
[4789.10s -> 4800.79s]  Yeah, the D. All right. Hey, Sybil. Oh, hey there, Sam and Max.
[4800.79s -> 4805.19s]  What was all that commotion outside? Just a little urban renewal project that
[4805.19s -> 4808.15s]  got out of hand. By the way, didn't you tell us that you
[4808.15s -> 4810.63s]  wished your office was closer to a good restaurant?
[4810.63s -> 4816.58s]  That's right. Why? No reason. All right, what are you doing here? What
[4816.58s -> 4819.22s]  brings you here? I thought it would be fun to play this
[4819.22s -> 4822.18s]  trivia quiz. But instead we're stuck watching
[4822.18s -> 4824.98s]  Stinky make a mockery of the word knowledge.
[4824.98s -> 4829.22s]  Sounds like fun to me. Yeah, Max and I always have a blast making a mockery of
[4829.22s -> 4834.98s]  the word justice. How Stinky rooting for trivia.
[4834.98s -> 4839.70s]  No, I'm sure my answers are right. But Stinky says otherwise.
[4839.70s -> 4844.10s]  I'm sure you're right too, dear. If this is too aggravating.
[4844.10s -> 4849.06s]  Oh no, this is fine, Abe. I'm just enjoying being here with you.
[4849.14s -> 4853.14s]  If I weren't trying to impress Abe, I thought I saw that
[4853.14s -> 4857.54s]  lying witch's eyes out. She doesn't want to be here. Get her out quick.
[4857.54s -> 4860.98s]  Otherwise your entire relationship is based on a lie.
[4860.98s -> 4864.82s]  Why are you giving out relationship advice, Max? I just want to see a good
[4864.82s -> 4868.68s]  cat fight. Anytime somebody says on a date,
[4868.68s -> 4874.26s]  no, no, no, I just like being here with you.
[4874.26s -> 4885.43s]  Out. Because that means, no, I hate everything that's happening here, but
[4885.43s -> 4895.35s]  I like you. So it's like, oh shit. When you're the most interesting thing
[4895.35s -> 4902.86s]  in the laser tag area, I think, yeah, at least come on. She probably doesn't
[4902.86s -> 4908.66s]  like laser tag. And why did you pick that in the
[4908.66s -> 4911.83s]  first place? You gotta go somewhere you're both
[4911.83s -> 4918.47s]  gonna like. You kids be like, oh I like laser, let's go play laser tag.
[4918.47s -> 4926.44s]  Go see a movie. Having fun yet? I know she's cheating, but I don't want to
[4926.44s -> 4930.68s]  ruin my date. Laser tag? Yeah, you decided to take her to
[4930.68s -> 4933.88s]  laser tag or take him to laser tag, doesn't matter.
[4933.88s -> 4937.00s]  And you thought it was a good idea. Yeah, I love laser tag. It's awesome. I'm so,
[4937.00s -> 4940.60s]  I love, it's my favorite thing. Oh, this is cool. Yeah, pick you up at
[4940.60s -> 4943.40s]  eight. Okay, cool. And you go there and you're moving,
[4943.40s -> 4947.13s]  you go here all the time and you fucking lighten up the scoreboard.
[4947.13s -> 4952.84s]  You do so many more points than them. That's not, that's, why, why is that
[4952.84s -> 4957.38s]  fun? Don't do that. He's speaking from
[4957.38s -> 4961.83s]  experience. It's too specific to be a random joke.
[4961.83s -> 4971.30s]  Let me help you here. By the way, I used the name cloud9
[4971.30s -> 4975.93s]  long time ago for my laser tag days. This is before that company even existed.
[4975.93s -> 4982.02s]  I was like 12. I swear to god this is real.
[4982.02s -> 4998.63s]  Are you and Abe on a date? Well, if you want to call it that. I did that
[4998.63s -> 5000.31s]  when I took a girl bowling. What if I wanted to call it
[5000.31s -> 5004.63s]  the unspeakable obscenity from beyond space cackling on the threshold of
[5004.63s -> 5011.56s]  utter madness. I think I'd prefer date. What, do you get like a bunch of
[5011.60s -> 5020.36s]  strikes when she was on her like phone?
[5020.36s -> 5029.00s]  Okay, so let's let's figure the trivia thing.
[5029.00s -> 5033.16s]  Yeah, that's uh red flag number one. If you're having a great time and she's on
[5033.16s -> 5041.14s]  her phone. Hiya, stinky. If that is your real
[5041.14s -> 5044.58s]  name. Uh, who are you two again? Sam and Max,
[5044.58s -> 5047.78s]  freelance police. The real stinky's favorite customers.
[5047.78s -> 5051.46s]  It says so right on our frequent diner cards. Which conveniently double as
[5051.46s -> 5055.46s]  organ donor cards. Oh yeah, Sam and Max.
[5055.46s -> 5059.30s]  Grandpa warned me about you two when he left the restaurant to me.
[5059.30s -> 5064.42s]  Something about frequent threats of violence and refusal to pay your bill.
[5064.42s -> 5072.54s]  He remembered us. Okay, why are all these people? What's going on? There's a lot
[5072.54s -> 5075.18s]  of people here. Two. It's a trivia contest.
[5075.18s -> 5078.78s]  It's fun. People get to show off how little they know
[5078.78s -> 5081.74s]  and I get to show off how much I know.
[5081.74s -> 5085.10s]  That doesn't sound like much incentive to play. Shows what you know.
[5085.10s -> 5089.50s]  Oh, and there's a big prize too. What's the prize? What's the prize for the
[5089.50s -> 5094.54s]  trivia contest? If anyone wins, they get my ancient heirloom.
[5094.54s -> 5099.74s]  Sickly man on a horse. Famine. Pestilence. Not that anyone's come close to winning yet.
[5099.74s -> 5103.18s]  My sophisticated questions are just too esoteric for these
[5103.18s -> 5108.38s]  booth monkeys. Booth monkeys? Where? It's just an expression.
[5108.38s -> 5114.65s]  No, not wrath. They think of the seven horses of sins.
[5114.65s -> 5122.87s]  Not the four horsemen of the apocalypse. Okay, what can we play? How do you play?
[5122.87s -> 5127.19s]  It's easy. Just grab a trivia pad. I'll read a question.
[5127.19s -> 5130.79s]  You write down the answer. I'll review the answers.
[5130.79s -> 5134.95s]  Eleven horses of evil. And then you'll see how much smarter I am than everyone else.
[5134.95s -> 5139.85s]  You can choose a team if you want. Oh, oh, Sam! Kick me! Kick me!
[5139.85s -> 5143.83s]  Okay, we could order food. We'd like to order something.
[5143.83s -> 5148.07s]  We're all out. Of what? Whatever you're going to order.
[5148.07s -> 5151.58s]  That's okay. We just want to order it anyway.
[5151.58s -> 5157.37s]  All right. The daily special. Poached eggs with tinfoil. Tuna sandwich with
[5157.37s -> 5162.14s]  peppers and pop rocks. Ooh. We'd like the tuna sandwich, extra
[5162.14s -> 5164.78s]  peppers and pop rocks on white bread. That sounds kind of cool.
[5164.78s -> 5169.69s]  I need an al gore and mariachi pans writing a disco ball.
[5169.69s -> 5172.73s]  Sweet and sour salt water. That sounds good too. Sweet and sour salt
[5172.73s -> 5176.65s]  water taffy. Sal? Julia Roberts. Put a bullet in her brain and kiss her
[5176.65s -> 5180.01s]  with Andy Rooney. It's like my secret dreams made
[5180.01s -> 5184.41s]  audible. Two yogurts and a turkey sandwich.
[5184.41s -> 5187.85s]  We'll have two yogurts and an open-faced turkey sandwich. Sal?
[5187.85s -> 5191.91s]  Hubeless times two with a side of Brady culture.
[5191.91s -> 5195.35s]  Uh, poached eggs with tinfoil. We'll have the poached eggs with tinfoil.
[5195.35s -> 5201.11s]  Sal, give me the Norse god Thor in a terrarium and spank him.
[5201.11s -> 5204.55s]  Double biscuit burger no clams. I'd like the double burger baked in
[5204.55s -> 5207.67s]  biscuit dough. Hold the clams. Half a doppelganger in tight
[5207.75s -> 5211.91s]  pants singing solo. Precious special with hash browns.
[5211.91s -> 5214.55s]  Can I get the precious special with hash browns?
[5214.55s -> 5219.19s]  Sal, two limini snickets in a Mexican standoff with a prairie dog.
[5219.19s -> 5223.11s]  What's the daily special? I'd like the daily special. Sal, condi rice, kickboxing
[5223.11s -> 5229.03s]  the buddha, Thai style. What's in it? What do you mean what's in it?
[5229.03s -> 5234.54s]  On second thought, I'm on a diet. All right, what was that about trivia?
[5234.54s -> 5238.54s]  What's happening again? A trivia contest. Just grab a pad and try
[5238.54s -> 5241.98s]  around. Okay, so let's go try around.
[5241.98s -> 5246.46s]  But how's business? Exhaust all actions. Well, it's no Italian villa rendezvous with
[5246.46s -> 5249.82s]  George Clooney, but reopening a family restaurant is
[5249.82s -> 5253.34s]  very fulfilling. Bringing people closer to obesity-induced
[5253.34s -> 5256.06s]  ischemic heart disease is its own reward.
[5256.06s -> 5259.18s]  On the other hand, George is much easier on the eyes
[5259.18s -> 5266.60s]  and the feet. My dogs are barking louder than you, Fido.
[5268.76s -> 5272.04s]  Standing up all day getting you down? And how?
[5272.04s -> 5275.88s]  I was made for sending beachside and capri, not slinging hash
[5275.88s -> 5296.92s]  counter side for a pack of ingrates. The forbidden word.
[5296.92s -> 5305.86s]  So long. All right, well let's sit down.
[5305.86s -> 5310.57s]  Let's give this trivia question a try. It's D.
[5310.57s -> 5315.05s]  Okay, let's hear everyone's answers. We'll start with you,
[5315.05s -> 5319.53s]  Sybil. I chose A. Of course you did, dear.
[5319.53s -> 5324.66s]  Because you're wrong. I also chose A.
[5324.66s -> 5327.86s]  And that's very sweet, Mr. President. But also
[5327.86s -> 5336.36s]  very wrong. The answer is D. D. Wait. Oh, I'm sorry. That is wrong.
[5336.36s -> 5343.16s]  We also chose D. Really? Hilarious. And again wrong. The correct
[5343.16s -> 5349.88s]  answer was actually B. B? Liar. All right, next question.
[5349.88s -> 5353.24s]  This day of the week comes between Tuesday and Thursday.
[5353.24s -> 5360.60s]  What is it? A. Doomsday. B. Wednesday. C. Doris Day. D.
[5360.60s -> 5372.06s]  Menachem Begin. Doomsday. Okay, let's hear everyone's answers.
[5372.06s -> 5375.02s]  I think we have to make them choose the wrong answers. I love how you keep
[5375.02s -> 5377.02s]  playing even though you're always wrong.
[5377.02s -> 5384.55s]  Never lose that. I also chose B. We all have to choose the right answer. Oh, how cute.
[5384.55s -> 5388.63s]  You two are like identical twins or something with your enormous foreheads
[5388.63s -> 5392.87s]  and your matching wrong answers. The answer is D. D.
[5392.87s -> 5395.99s]  No, it is not. Not. How could you be bad at this?
[5395.99s -> 5402.95s]  What are you talking about? Oh, too bad. Wrong. Only one answer
[5402.95s -> 5405.75s]  wasn't guessed, so it was obviously the correct one.
[5405.75s -> 5410.55s]  I get it. I understand now. That's just not true. I know what you gotta do.
[5410.55s -> 5413.75s]  Next. Here's the plan. Which of the following women's names
[5413.75s -> 5420.47s]  is also the name of an herb? You gotta make everybody somebody has to win. C.
[5420.47s -> 5424.95s]  Rosemary. D. The pyloric sphincter. None of this matters.
[5424.95s -> 5428.79s]  So convince everybody to choose a different answer and then choose the
[5428.79s -> 5436.17s]  one that was not picked. So somebody has to be right. 23
[5436.17s -> 5441.53s]  Skadoo, Mr. Lincoln. What's shaking, Mr. X, president?
[5441.53s -> 5447.69s]  Hmm? Oh, it's you two. I also chose D. Wanna compare notes on the trivia
[5447.69s -> 5450.89s]  contest? That's not necessary. Abe and I know
[5450.89s -> 5453.93s]  what we're doing. That's right. We're doing fine.
[5453.93s -> 5461.19s]  Help me out here, guys. We think it's A. We think it's A.
[5461.19s -> 5469.43s]  Okay. All right. Bye. See you, A.L. Represent. We think it's B.
[5469.43s -> 5472.79s]  Do you know the answer to the trivia question? I'd rather not say.
[5472.79s -> 5475.91s]  I'm kind of competitive. That's okay. We're not.
[5475.91s -> 5479.59s]  Why? What do you think the answer is? B.
[5479.59s -> 5487.51s]  We think it's B. Hmm. Good to know. Okay. See ya, Sybil. Then have you pick C.
[5487.51s -> 5491.27s]  Hello, sir. Oh, I thought you were my family.
[5491.27s -> 5494.87s]  They always try to surprise me on my birthday. Someone's gonna win the prize and then I just...
[5494.87s -> 5507.88s]  What day? What the fuck was that? That was weird.
[5507.88s -> 5511.96s]  Okay. Wanna compare notes on the trivia contest?
[5511.96s -> 5516.28s]  What do you think the answer is? C. We think it's C. And then we're gonna pick D.
[5516.28s -> 5520.38s]  That's the best I can expect from civilians.
[5520.38s -> 5526.18s]  Sir, so long. We have five community subs coming in. Thanks for the five community
[5526.18s -> 5532.97s]  subs, Tour T. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Five community subs.
[5532.97s -> 5538.57s]  I chose C. Oh, only C was an option. Wrong.
[5538.57s -> 5542.25s]  I chose A. Scratch it off.
[5542.25s -> 5549.83s]  Sadly, you're wrong. The answer is D. D. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. What?
[5549.83s -> 5553.11s]  What? We also chose D. Oh, he chooses D.
[5553.11s -> 5557.83s]  The correct answer was B. He chooses D every time. Time for a new...
[5557.83s -> 5560.95s]  Who is buried in Grant's tomb? No matter what.
[5560.95s -> 5563.35s]  A. Grant. B. C. Abbott and Costello.
[5563.35s -> 5567.03s]  All right. All right. It's C. D. Spam.
[5567.03s -> 5573.67s]  C. We pick C. He's gonna pick D. You pick A.
[5573.67s -> 5576.87s]  Let's talk trivia. Wanna compare notes on the trivia contest?
[5576.87s -> 5580.63s]  Yes. Hook a brother up. We think it's A.
[5580.63s -> 5586.84s]  Got it. See you, A.L. Wanna compare notes?
[5586.84s -> 5590.95s]  Why? What do you... We think it's B.
[5590.95s -> 5598.04s]  Okay. See ya, Sybil. He always picks D.
[5598.04s -> 5601.24s]  What's the actual... Wait. What's the actual fucking answer here? Hold on.
[5601.24s -> 5608.71s]  Who is buried in Grant's tomb? Grant. So, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[5608.71s -> 5613.64s]  She's gonna answer Grant. So, Sybil is going to do Grant.
[5613.64s -> 5617.96s]  So, that means we have to give A to B and we have to do C.
[5617.96s -> 5623.53s]  Wanna compare notes on the trivia contest? She always gets pissed off.
[5623.53s -> 5626.57s]  Yes. Hook a brother up. So, you do B.
[5626.57s -> 5631.46s]  We think it's B. We're gonna do C. Thanks for the tip. See you, A.L.
[5631.46s -> 5636.76s]  Refres... Okay. So, then we're gonna do C. He's gonna do D.
[5636.76s -> 5645.34s]  Bingo. Problem solved. So, we do C.
[5645.34s -> 5648.94s]  Okay. Let's hear everyone's answers. He read chapters.
[5648.94s -> 5653.34s]  Of course you did, dear. Because you're wrong.
[5653.34s -> 5657.18s]  I chose B. Come on. I appreciate a man
[5657.18s -> 5661.34s]  unafraid to flaunt his ignorance. Wrong. You think I'd read chat?
[5661.34s -> 5664.94s]  The answer is D. D. I look over here and I
[5664.94s -> 5668.22s]  say random answers to random questions. I don't have chat open.
[5668.22s -> 5671.82s]  I've never had chat open. We chose C. No, that's wrong.
[5671.82s -> 5675.90s]  I guess it must be right. Well, congratulations.
[5675.90s -> 5679.02s]  I know you guys always say, nobody said that. I really enjoyed that you won, but I'm far too
[5679.02s -> 5682.38s]  magnanimous to let it bother me. Cheaters.
[5682.38s -> 5686.06s]  It's the limited edition pestilence maquette with super detailed open
[5686.06s -> 5689.50s]  sores. Oh, see how he slumps in this saddle.
[5689.50s -> 5692.46s]  Do you have any cool action features? I'm surprised I've been able to go four
[5692.46s -> 5695.66s]  years of doing this without people knowing. What's the worst a toy could do?
[5695.66s -> 5699.82s]  Choke a toddler? Blind a toddler? Eviscerate?
[5699.82s -> 5708.30s]  Well, it looks like nothing happened anyway. Let's go.
[5708.30s -> 5711.58s]  One guy is fake. One guy is just alternate accounts.
[5711.58s -> 5717.99s]  I have to find a way to reply to somebody. All right. So, we got
[5717.99s -> 5726.81s]  one horseman of the apocalypse. It is pestilence. I knew it. I knew it.
[5726.81s -> 5733.32s]  Still need to do something. Can I do anything over here? What about down here?
[5733.32s -> 5736.68s]  Whoa, wait a minute. Jimmy Tootie. Hey, my missing boxing glove. Whoa, he's got one.
[5736.68s -> 5741.72s]  That's my lucky glove cut. Jimmy Tootie, what are you and your
[5741.72s -> 5745.24s]  unsavory pals doing in the burned out husk of this robot?
[5745.24s -> 5749.08s]  The first rule is we don't talk about what goes on in the burned out
[5749.08s -> 5755.88s]  husk of this robot. Hey, eat horse. Give it to me. Nothing. Do it. That's my
[5755.88s -> 5759.24s]  championship trophy and I want it bearing square.
[5759.24s -> 5762.76s]  That's my trophy. I could probably get it if I tried.
[5762.76s -> 5767.40s]  They're giving out trophies now? Boxing championship, wise guy.
[5767.40s -> 5772.68s]  See ya, suckers. Okay, so how do we get him a boxing championship?
[5772.68s -> 5778.90s]  Well, isn't that funny? Boxing Betty. Do with this.
[5781.59s -> 5783.59s]  Do I have to play this or are they going to do it on their own?
[5800.84s -> 5804.36s]  Gabby J. Yay, yay, yay.
[5815.85s -> 5818.81s]  Okay, hold on. We got five community subs from PilotGuy. Thank you to the
[5818.81s -> 5827.50s]  five sub PilotGuy. Appreciate it. Thank you. Coming in with subs.
[5828.52s -> 5832.52s]  What do we got? Move your mouse left and right to dodge and click either mouse
[5832.52s -> 5835.96s]  button to punch or use the keyboard. I'm going to use the keyboard. Use the
[5835.96s -> 5839.72s]  left and right arrow keys to dodge and then use A or D to punch.
[5839.72s -> 5845.32s]  So it really is punch out. It is punch out.
[5845.32s -> 5859.19s]  Yo.
[5868.23s -> 5884.49s]  More punch out? Uh oh. Bald Bull. Do I have to actually do the Bald Bull
[5884.49s -> 5891.82s]  mechanic? He like runs in.
[5893.90s -> 5914.79s]  Who's left? Final opponent? The Giant Rad. He's got a huge glove.
[5915.83s -> 5928.01s]  Can I not dodge that glove? And maybe I can't dodge that side.
[5929.45s -> 5934.90s]  We'll find out. Oh, he can. Oh, that was quick.
[5935.78s -> 5944.14s]  Left jab. Left hook, go left. Right hook, put him away. One more.
[5945.18s -> 5958.98s]  Right hook, and Jimmy goes down. It's the super exclusive,
[5958.98s -> 5963.22s]  more action figure with extra, hmm, there are pieces missing.
[5963.22s -> 5966.50s]  I don't see the weapons of mass destruction. Eh, who needs them?
[5967.46s -> 5972.74s]  How could I lose? I'm no expert, Jimmy, but I bet being a loser helped.
[5973.30s -> 5974.58s]  Four.
[5980.42s -> 5984.42s]  I think they kind of need to update the four horsemen, don't you think?
[5991.30s -> 5993.78s]  Like, where's the horseman of identity theft?
[5998.02s -> 6003.18s]  That's a huge problem right now. Where's the horseman of,
[6003.90s -> 6010.90s]  you know, like a pestilence? Famine? No, where's the horseman of low Instagram likes?
[6011.62s -> 6024.57s]  That's what we care about now. Suicide isn't the answer. Things will turn up. Think of your loved
[6024.57s -> 6048.46s]  ones. I stuck a nerve on that one. People are getting defensive here. Wait, what did he say
[6048.46s -> 6061.98s]  about me? What did he say? I'll bite him. All right, uh, I have a big question.
[6068.62s -> 6074.46s]  I think like a millennial like zoomer joke. How many times have you wrote boomer jokes in here?
[6074.46s -> 6078.70s]  What, I'm allowed to just take them, but I can't dish it out? What's up with that?
[6085.11s -> 6088.15s]  Sometimes you guys gotta play defense. It's not all offense.
[6094.34s -> 6104.22s]  Try to land. Oh, my God. Which one's the incontinent one again? I couldn't tell you.
[6104.22s -> 6106.38s]  Boy, you really are useless. Aren't you?
[6109.37s -> 6111.45s]  It's not funny when you're making fun of me.
[6114.47s -> 6118.15s]  Uh, think of your loved ones. You know, your wife's going to give you hell if you kill
[6118.15s -> 6125.93s]  yourself. You're overreacting, Jimmy. You think? Sure. Your wife probably never really
[6126.01s -> 6131.91s]  loved you in the first place. Jesus Christ, that's fucking awful.
[6134.60s -> 6138.60s]  It's always darkest before the dawn, Jimmy. What the hell does that even mean?
[6139.32s -> 6143.40s]  Give it up, Sam. Oh, you're right. If somebody as dim as you can tell I'm
[6143.40s -> 6147.56s]  just phoning it in, why bother? Thank God. Um, I don't know.
[6149.62s -> 6154.18s]  Max, I don't think this is helping. I disagree, Sam. I feel much better about
[6154.18s -> 6175.48s]  myself already. Uh, well, do I have any items? Maze? Jimmy, care to try out a maze?
[6175.48s -> 6183.06s]  No way. I ain't falling for that. I'm not gonna shoot him. That's not
[6183.06s -> 6187.30s]  gonna do anything. No, Jimmy's gonna have to do this for himself. Oh, God.
[6187.78s -> 6211.26s]  Nobody's home. I love, I love that. So I love, I love just how I make like a, like a zoomer
[6211.26s -> 6221.19s]  reference and all of a sudden it's just like, boom, chat explodes. Right? Oh, that's so
[6221.19s -> 6225.85s]  fucking funny. I love it. Can I talk to, I can't talk to the other rat, I don't think.
[6225.85s -> 6232.39s]  Throw a snowball at him. It's gonna melt. It's like a 16 hour car ride.
[6239.19s -> 6245.74s]  But can I maybe, where is he on the left? Where's my office? Here's the window. Hold on. Wait a
[6245.74s -> 6262.68s]  minute. I can't reach Jimmy from here. No, we'll have to talk to him from downstairs.
[6263.64s -> 6267.48s]  Nope. Well, let's listen to the answering machine. What does that sound? Oh.
[6267.48s -> 6275.96s]  I mean, this is IP Freeway. Stick Charmer in the closet. Then you should see a doctor
[6275.96s -> 6283.34s]  about that. No way. Crank calls only work when you call someone besides us. This is
[6283.34s -> 6292.81s]  the only phone number I can remember, Sam. Can I like, I want to, you know when you
[6292.81s -> 6311.38s]  get like rewind and relive moments? I want to relive that one. Oh, I love it. This is,
[6311.38s -> 6316.84s]  I love it. I love this. It's so much fun. All right, let's go.
[6322.97s -> 6326.65s]  Let's go back to the North Pole. I need a snowball. We're off to the North Pole.
[6327.61s -> 6347.38s]  A new, okay. So I have two horsemen. I have the record. Hmm. Can I, nothing can be done
[6347.38s -> 6352.78s]  with these two. I have to, what do I do with the snowball? Can I bring the snowball back
[6352.78s -> 6361.11s]  and throw it at him? Let's see. There's a time limit on it, so let's go. Where to, Sam?
[6361.75s -> 6375.58s]  Let's head back to civilization or what's left of it. Why would I do that? To throw the
[6375.66s -> 6384.90s]  snowball at the rat to stop him from jumping off the ledge? Wouldn't this knock him off the ledge?
[6394.10s -> 6396.98s]  That's not how it works. Ah, Bosco's maybe.
[6399.22s -> 6401.86s]  I don't know. Let's try, maybe go, let's try Bosco's again.
[6402.66s -> 6407.51s]  Do you ever look at your subreddit all the time?
[6412.23s -> 6415.67s]  Being hit with a bleached snowball at this range could cause permanent blindness.
[6415.67s -> 6422.31s]  And usually draw the line at temporary blindness. Microwave, microwave the snowball. I don't know.
[6423.27s -> 6428.71s]  Does he have one? But we have something with the gifts. Save, Bosco. We'll take that package
[6428.71s -> 6440.79s]  off your hands for you. Step back, boy. That's mine. Get away from me. I can't like occupy
[6440.79s -> 6451.75s]  his brain with a maze. Maybe I probably have to send him. Wait, hold on, gift tags? Maybe
[6451.75s -> 6453.59s]  make him think it's not. I don't think I can send that in the mail.
[6455.35s -> 6465.13s]  X-ray machine. It's probably something to do with sending him a present. Hey, an x-ray machine.
[6465.13s -> 6474.50s]  Don't fool with that. Even dark rooms need popsicles. What's going on in the refrigerator?
[6475.14s -> 6482.18s]  Stay away from my cryogenic freezer. Yeah, but what reddit? They said your reddit.
[6482.18s -> 6486.50s]  If it's a cryogenic freezer, why are there still mustard-covered snow cones in there?
[6486.50s -> 6490.58s]  Just because I'll be in suspended animation doesn't mean I don't want a snack.
[6493.02s -> 6503.26s]  All right, this is the bathroom. Something to do with the gift. X-ray viewer. Oh,
[6505.10s -> 6510.33s]  it's in there. All right, we have to send Bosco a present. We're going to send Bosco
[6510.33s -> 6520.31s]  a present and then we're going to take this one. So we got to get a package sent to him
[6520.31s -> 6528.55s]  and it's going to be green and it's going to be a clock. Clock. Send him a clock. Got it. I win.
[6529.93s -> 6536.76s]  Sometimes it's just so easy. I get headaches all the time. Like my brain is so fucking huge it
[6536.76s -> 6540.60s]  can barely be in the skull. It's just like I want to just let it come out. You know what
[6540.60s -> 6552.09s]  I mean? That's what my mother used to tell me. Mom, I have a really bad headache. That's
[6552.09s -> 6570.78s]  because you got such a big brain, sweetie. Off to the North Pole. That's not true.
[6572.74s -> 6586.50s]  Your mom lied. Jesus, guys. Oh my god. Yeah, Neanderthals have big brains too.
[6587.06s -> 6602.25s]  Yeah, but they didn't know how to use them. Okay, so now I get a gift. Bingo.
[6603.27s -> 6609.51s]  Sessomatic stopwatch. It's going to Bosco. With a constant reminder that they're always
[6609.51s -> 6614.15s]  running late. You can hear the precious moments of your life passing with every second. Now we
[6614.15s -> 6621.11s]  just need to attach a gift tag. Gift tag to Bosco. What unlucky person should we mail this to?
[6621.11s -> 6632.63s]  You know. Bosco might like that. It's not green though. Does that matter? I don't think
[6632.63s -> 6644.14s]  that matters. Brain spickness does not equal smartness. For example, blue whales. You're
[6644.78s -> 6662.42s]  talking about not a human. Let's go get it. Where to, Sam? Let's head back to civilization
[6662.42s -> 6665.78s]  or what's left of it. Good thinking. But how do you know? We can always freeze to death
[6665.78s -> 6670.65s]  out here later. How do you know how smart a blue whale is? Have you talked to a blue
[6670.65s -> 6675.29s]  whale before? No, scientists have like dropped cameras down to the deep sea and taken a few
[6675.29s -> 6690.42s]  pictures and put it on like Instagram trying to get a bunch of likes. Dude, what is with
[6691.30s -> 6694.90s]  okay. We're going to talk after this.
[6704.66s -> 6707.78s]  So where's the other one?
[6723.59s -> 6732.79s]  We're good at waiting to open presents, a little buddy. Wait, where's my package? Dear God,
[6732.79s -> 6737.99s]  they took it and they took Sam and Max too. There ain't no place safe.
[6739.91s -> 6747.03s]  All right. So listen, the word Instagram has the immediate, innate,
[6747.03s -> 6752.46s]  complete opposite reaction of the word speed. Think about that. When I say, oh, an
[6752.46s -> 6771.59s]  Instagram, I'm going to fuck up you guys right now. You ready? Instagram likes speed,
[6771.59s -> 6787.93s]  Instagram likes Instagram speed speed. What do I do? What do I do? I need one more.
[6788.01s -> 6794.65s]  Let's just stay here. You never take me anywhere. I just took you to the North Pole.
[6794.65s -> 6800.09s]  That's how I beat the villain at the end of the movie. I used that tactic. That's all they had
[6800.09s -> 6815.99s]  to do. I beat the robot villain at the end of the movie. I went, you are the villain.
[6816.86s -> 6823.91s]  Sometimes the villain wins. I better be careful though, because the villain,
[6823.91s -> 6829.99s]  only temporary, no, the villain can like, and we gotta be careful because like the villain
[6831.05s -> 6837.16s]  somehow always in every form of media is like, wait, I'm not a bad guy as I can't win.
[6837.80s -> 6856.06s]  But sometimes they do. Sometimes they do, guys. I need one more. Can I go in here?
[6856.70s -> 6860.79s]  There's actually been like quite a few movies and TV shows where the bad guy did win.
[6861.35s -> 6879.66s]  I can name you a few very recent ones. Uh-huh. Like, wait, what? Wait, wait, wait, wait,
[6879.66s -> 6883.26s]  wait, what? Like, I'm not going to say, I don't even know what you mean by this,
[6883.26s -> 6895.26s]  but hold on. I'm trying to piece that together in my brain. Megamind. Does that, does,
[6896.14s -> 6914.65s]  does Megamind win? But at the end of the movie, does Megamind lose? You know what I mean? Like
[6914.65s -> 6920.87s]  I'm saying, like I love when they, when they skirt around tropes like that. I'm spoiling
[6920.87s -> 6937.26s]  Megamind. No, what? I didn't spoil, I just said that's a trope in movies, like the bad
[6937.26s -> 6958.49s]  guy doesn't win. I didn't mean, I didn't spoil Megamind. You just spoiled every single movie.
[6959.53s -> 6965.77s]  That's not how that works, okay? Just because somebody says the bad guy doesn't always win.
[6966.49s -> 6971.61s]  The bad guy wins, but the bad guy doesn't always win. I just explained to you every
[6971.61s -> 6975.61s]  piece of fucking media that's ever, and guess what? There's a bad guy in this one too.
[6975.61s -> 6981.46s]  Sometimes a bad guy, the bad guy won in episode three. Bad guy didn't win in episode five.
[6981.46s -> 6992.44s]  I, what do you mean? I'm spoiling every fucking movie. Every single piece of media.
[6992.44s -> 7007.21s]  That's not, come on. Megamind, who cares? So long. Megamind was like a fucking Will
[7007.21s -> 7014.02s]  Farrell movie that came out between like two other Will Farrell movies. That was like a Will
[7014.02s -> 7021.06s]  Farrell 1.4 in the middle of like a 1.0 Will Farrell and 2.0 Will Farrell. You don't care
[7021.06s -> 7029.74s]  about Mega, I didn't spoil Megamind. I just asked a question. What do you mean Will Farrell's
[7029.74s -> 7052.52s]  not even in it? Will Farrell is Megamind. I don't even need to, I just watched the first
[7052.60s -> 7060.82s]  five seconds of the trailer of Will Farrell. I can't believe you spoiled Megamind.
[7062.52s -> 7072.84s]  You said the bad guy doesn't win in movies. Oh no, I could never play Super Mario Brothers
[7072.84s -> 7087.94s]  ever again. I could never play any. Streamer says it's okay to spoil movies if you don't
[7087.94s -> 7106.28s]  care. That's not, all right, we're done with this. Oh no, wait, the bad guy doesn't always,
[7106.28s -> 7111.30s]  the bad guy doesn't win in movies. I like when the bad guy wins, but the bad guy doesn't win.
[7115.78s -> 7123.94s]  You mean to tell me that Bowser is not gonna win? I thought this time when he captured the
[7123.94s -> 7135.38s]  princess it was gonna work. Can we start the exorcism now? No, we still need three more
[7135.38s -> 7146.82s]  horsemen. Let's hurry, I've got a sudden inexplicable craving for pea soup. I hope
[7146.82s -> 7151.62s]  this demon appreciates all the work we're going through. I just hope he doesn't rip our lungs out
[7151.62s -> 7156.82s]  and eat them in front of us. Bowser does win in one of the games, but that's what I'm saying.
[7156.82s -> 7162.98s]  What, what are you talking about? Bowser is like a, wins sometimes, but he loses all the time.
[7164.42s -> 7172.46s]  You'll have to, we still need one more horseman. Okay, I gotta get one more horseman.
[7173.10s -> 7176.14s]  It's definitely not here. It's something to do with this shit, but it's not here.
[7181.27s -> 7186.01s]  How does he win sometimes if he loses all the time? I don't know.
[7189.77s -> 7192.09s]  No, one snowball is probably more than enough.
[7195.93s -> 7199.69s]  So basically what you're saying is sometimes different things happen in movies.
[7200.57s -> 7205.69s]  Sure, and everybody lost their mind. I don't even know where Megamind came from.
[7205.69s -> 7224.78s]  Or what's left of it. Where the fuck did Megamind come from? I don't even know what
[7224.78s -> 7235.93s]  happened. Garage. Oh, it was the Villains Win movies. No, because you guys called me a villain
[7235.93s -> 7244.17s]  and I said, Hey, does Villain win sometimes, doesn't he? And then all of a sudden.
[7257.50s -> 7262.62s]  All right, well these guys, there it is. There it is. How do I get this?
[7274.20s -> 7279.24s]  Autobot is here before you open this body shop. A string of unsuccessful body shops.
[7282.76s -> 7287.88s]  What makes you think you will have better luck? A recent influx of road debris will
[7287.88s -> 7294.84s]  result in the projected six four percent increase in revenue. Route debris from the main
[7295.00s -> 7295.56s]  track.
[7309.06s -> 7312.42s]  Okay, you don't like Torture Me Elmer. What have you got against Torture Me Elmer?
[7313.38s -> 7319.30s]  Show us. My associates were once the most popular toys available, but no more.
[7320.10s -> 7327.38s]  Beating up a doll cannot compare with the wonder and excitement of arithmetic and grammar.
[7327.38s -> 7333.06s]  Uh oh, Max. I think the cops may have been educational toys. I knew there was a reason
[7333.06s -> 7339.02s]  I didn't like them. You know how to fix cars. So do you know anything about cars?
[7339.02s -> 7343.50s]  If we didn't, why would we open a car shop? Because you're lonely,
[7343.50s -> 7349.50s]  forgotten machines who do anything to feel useful. Processing. Oh dear. Import appears
[7349.50s -> 7354.62s]  valid. I just had a breakthrough. This is all about my dad.
[7358.84s -> 7363.24s]  All right, we want a hybrid. You guys turned the DeSoto into a hybrid.
[7363.24s -> 7368.28s]  Damn hippies. We are not. I just wanted to be able to use the carpool lane.
[7368.28s -> 7377.88s]  Since when do you stay in the lanes anyway, Sam? Okay. Torture Me Elmer is the hottest
[7377.88s -> 7384.68s]  toy this season. Elmer appeals to the lowest common denominator. He's a solo!
[7388.46s -> 7393.10s]  We'd like to pimp our car. Please make a selection from the following menu.
[7393.98s -> 7397.58s]  If you'd like the exclusive Death Horseman hood ornament, press one nine.
[7398.54s -> 7407.02s]  And what else? That is all we have. There was an ordering malfunction. Totally not my fault!
[7407.02s -> 7411.82s]  Actually, we also offer a wide range of completely worthless decorative decals.
[7413.80s -> 7417.96s]  We want that horseman. We'll take that Death Horseman hood ornament.
[7417.96s -> 7423.08s]  Excellent. First, however, you must complete the Pimplica driving challenge. Oh no.
[7423.72s -> 7427.72s]  I'll just give us the horse. Video game challenge. Where is this on the net?
[7427.72s -> 7432.12s]  We've pooled together our years of experience in designing the most advanced computer games
[7432.12s -> 7438.04s]  to bring you the ultimate augmented reality driving experience. Augmented reality? Yes.
[7438.04s -> 7442.68s]  While you were cooking, we placed a pair of our patented augmented reality goggles in your
[7442.68s -> 7449.96s]  vehicle. Okay. You did? Through the miracle of augmented reality, your driving experience
[7449.96s -> 7456.44s]  will be five to ten times more satisfying than ever before. Would you like to try the
[7456.44s -> 7465.88s]  driving challenge now? Yes. And how? Eat my dust. Initiating augmented reality driving secrets.
[7467.24s -> 7476.26s]  So I have to just win this driving challenge? Elmer's hit. I have to run over Elmer's.
[7476.26s -> 7486.58s]  Pimplica driving challenge. Thanks to advanced technology and the darkroom, you can now drive using a computer keyboard in addition to your mouse.
[7486.58s -> 7493.54s]  I'm really excited. How many do I have to hit? 30. Your mission is to have the displayed number of torture meal medals.
[7496.42s -> 7499.46s]  I can get that. And you must do it in the allotted time.
[7500.18s -> 7512.28s]  Well, let's go. Just go. That's right. I'm not non-efficient.
[7512.28s -> 7531.06s]  Fuck not. Once they put the pressure on, I can't do it. I got it.
[7541.82s -> 7553.66s]  I win. I don't. Got them all.
[7556.98s -> 7561.54s]  Look, Max. It's the sudden unexpected death figurine with super reaping action.
[7561.54s -> 7567.46s]  Now wherever we drive, pedestrians will feel the icy chill of death. More so than usual.
[7569.69s -> 7576.76s]  I didn't skip that. It was over. I didn't skip it. I didn't skip that. Hi guys. What's this about
[7576.76s -> 7581.64s]  decorative decals? We can outfit your ride with a wide assortment of decorative embellishments
[7581.64s -> 7588.12s]  created by our in-house auto detailing artist. How does he do that? I didn't skip it. His
[7588.12s -> 7594.52s]  mother was your label maker. Simply hit the street and obliterate rare objects. If we deem them
[7594.52s -> 7599.48s]  suitably interesting, we will reward you with a decal to commemorate such joyous destruction.
[7599.48s -> 7605.24s]  Now that's my kind of game. What should we be obliterating? That is for you to determine.
[7607.42s -> 7615.06s]  Okay, so no decals. All right, give me the horseman. Do I just have it in my inventory?
[7615.06s -> 7627.82s]  I don't. I don't. I don't. He's giving me horseman of death. It's icy cold. Complete
[7627.82s -> 7637.64s]  the exorcism. Where to, Sam? It's time to make a horror movie. It's time to have first and
[7637.64s -> 7643.38s]  last name and then the bad thing that happened to them as the title of the movie. Off to the
[7643.38s -> 7687.85s]  North Pole. The exorcism is definitely rose. Jenny Stevenson goes to hell. That's the last
[7687.85s -> 7695.29s]  one. Now we just have to sing the incantation. The haunting of Will Ferrell. Possibly the entire
[7695.29s -> 7702.01s]  earth as we know it, yes. It still hardly seems worth it. I feel like that could be a real
[7702.01s -> 7710.94s]  movie. All right, here we go. Let's do it. Let's put on the friendly demon song.
[7711.50s -> 7721.56s]  Here's some demon.
[7725.37s -> 7726.49s]  It was a gelatinous
[7733.78s -> 7734.58s]  mantle.
[7741.88s -> 7742.44s]  Mime sweeper.
[7746.42s -> 7749.82s]  Corporate presence.
[7751.98s -> 7757.11s]  Poor horseman. Suck him up. Roy G. Pitt.
[7759.91s -> 7765.91s]  The power of Christmas compels you. Any second now, Santa's gonna walk out that door demon free
[7765.91s -> 7770.15s]  and show us with gifts like absentee dad and guilty conscience. Did it work?
[7772.47s -> 7780.15s]  Wait, but he, you mean, but I thought, no. I quit. I'm gonna be a dentist. Is he dead?
[7785.64s -> 7793.16s]  Finish Navidad, baby. What? Nothing? Didn't you guys read the back of the instructions?
[7793.40s -> 7801.82s]  There's a back? Feeling hungry? My five dollar fill up box will do. I'm sorry.
[7802.54s -> 7807.74s]  Very important. Make sure you have the spirits of Christmas to contain the beast or you're
[7807.74s -> 7813.50s]  screwed. Shaman Max, it's up to you to save Christmas. Yep, we're screwed.
[7819.74s -> 7825.54s]  Sorry, I had to just ruin that. I'm sorry. I'm having too much fun today. You know what
[7825.54s -> 7830.34s]  I mean? I gotta like stop having fun. I gotta like shut up and have not have fun, right?
[7831.22s -> 7847.77s]  All right, so let's investigate. Can we just go in the room now? I just got 45 dollars for that
[7847.77s -> 7852.87s]  joke. Juno Upsetto, that joke deserved these bits. Thanks for the 45 dollar joke. That was
[7852.87s -> 7863.78s]  just for you. Thank you. That's a lot of money. Christmas pass, present and future.
[7867.45s -> 7875.45s]  You know us? We know all those who have ever ruined Christmas, especially the repeat offenders.
[7877.13s -> 7883.93s]  It's only supposed to be five dollars. Spirit of Christmas past, brothers. I am the spirit
[7883.93s -> 7891.61s]  of Christmas present. And that cat's the spirit of Christmas yet to come. He's shy.
[7892.49s -> 7897.45s]  What's your 20, good buddies? We could use some help saving Christmas. We're not bad
[7897.45s -> 7903.93s]  people. We've just had bad luck with major holidays and automobiles and federal statutes.
[7903.93s -> 7911.85s]  It is your own selfish actions that have brought this to pass. Selfish? We're freelance police.
[7911.85s -> 7918.97s]  We save the world, sometimes on purpose. You got no clue the bad karma you've built up, man.
[7918.97s -> 7926.73s]  You will need the combined help of all three of us to defeat the demon. We will show you
[7926.73s -> 7933.85s]  three Christmases you've ruined. Set them right and we will consent to help you.
[7933.85s -> 7938.57s]  Where are you going? I have to get some air. I'm gonna talk shit right now.
[7940.89s -> 7944.09s]  Pause it for a second. Somebody said when the game is funnier than the streamer.
[7945.42s -> 7952.44s]  Well I'm sorry. I'm talking in real time here by myself over a video game that I'm just saying
[7952.76s -> 7959.16s]  time. Of course the game's gonna, they had like years to make this game with a team of writers
[7959.72s -> 7967.05s]  who every day for months came up with jokes. What? Of course there's gonna be better humor
[7967.05s -> 7972.98s]  in here. They had like a year and a half to write the jokes. You gave me 10 seconds. Sorry
[7972.98s -> 7978.73s]  I spoiled Megamind. That's what this is about. I know it is. That's what this is about. They're
[7978.73s -> 7990.49s]  mad because I spoiled fucking Megamind on them. Hey Sam, what time is it? Let's see. The
[7990.49s -> 7996.42s]  little hand is on the freckle and the corn cob pipe is on the right eyeball. Ready? Where does
[7996.42s -> 8006.76s]  the time go? Look at this. It's Santa's magical stocking stuffer. It fills the sock with whatever
[8006.76s -> 8012.20s]  gift the owner deserves. Oh let's try it. I think we'd need to have socks first. I was gonna
[8012.20s -> 8015.32s]  see them theaters after the stream. It's a record of what people got. You know how they
[8016.20s -> 8021.48s]  Jenny A. Nice kid. Sock full of toys. I know we're still on this but. Means well.
[8021.56s -> 8029.40s]  Sock full of candy. Steven G. Liar. Sock full of coal. Wow. Santa must really hate liars.
[8029.40s -> 8034.12s]  You know when they bring back movies for a limited run in the theaters? What if they
[8034.12s -> 8038.44s]  brought Megamind back for a new another run in the theaters for some reason? If they break
[8038.44s -> 8045.96s]  to IMAX or something or 3D for a couple months? Oh man. That would be fucking hilarious. But
[8045.96s -> 8049.88s]  why would they ever do that? That's such a forgettable movie. Not that it was a bad movie,
[8049.88s -> 8054.20s]  right? Listen, it's just not a movie you would bring back. Didn't win the Academy Awards.
[8054.92s -> 8072.44s]  That's my son's favorite movie. That's fine. I didn't say it was a bad movie.
[8073.24s -> 8079.96s]  No, one snowball is probably more than enough. A concrete car thanks for the five community
[8079.96s -> 8083.16s]  subs. There's a lot in this one. There's like a bunch of different things to do.
[8083.16s -> 8087.88s]  You cats ready to take a freaky trip to the past? Thanks for the five subs. You bet!
[8089.16s -> 8104.47s]  A team of writers spent months writing Megamind. Of course it's going to be better than this stream.
[8106.33s -> 8122.90s]  The game crashed. Uh oh. I didn't save it once. Is there an autosave here? No,
[8122.90s -> 8126.10s]  okay. I think we're fine. I just had my stomach just hurt for a second. I was like,
[8126.18s -> 8146.71s]  that was two hours. Gone. Oh boy, I hope so. Come on. What is this? Where is this?
[8147.67s -> 8151.91s]  Okay, I'm fucking having a little panic attack here because this is the first image of the
[8151.91s -> 8170.07s]  beginning of the game. Oh, thank god. Okay. Oh. All right, well let's go to the future.
[8193.94s -> 8200.06s]  The future. Oh no, we're spoiling our future.
[8227.38s -> 8233.70s]  Change our snackless fate. Surely we can alter these shadows before us perhaps with a larger
[8233.70s -> 8239.38s]  economy size bag of pork rinds or chips. You know, Max, we could find a way to get our future
[8239.38s -> 8253.96s]  selves out of this place. Yeah, I guess that'd work. So, uh, what's the scenario here? We need
[8253.96s -> 8259.40s]  to get snacks or something. We probably have to change the past. Why did you bring us here,
[8259.40s -> 8264.28s]  spirit? What do we do? Who wins the SEC? We probably have to bounce around between. I got
[8264.28s -> 8272.34s]  money riding on it. Yes, our future selves are trapped to die on a tiny outcropping of ash
[8272.34s -> 8279.93s]  surrounded by roiling magma. But what is it we're here to fix? Hold on, hold on before everybody
[8279.93s -> 8290.10s]  screams. I thought you can't talk to yourself. Don't I crack you up now, Sam? Sorry pal,
[8290.10s -> 8296.89s]  his material just seems fresher somehow. Hey, future me, would it hurt you to hit the treadmill
[8296.89s -> 8302.65s]  once in a while? Did you say something, Max? You mean after we're gonna die, it burns, it burns?
[8303.45s -> 8313.10s]  Topical. What do you mean? Anything else in here? No, just lava. All right, let's go to the past.
[8326.55s -> 8330.87s]  Game saved. I'm so glad they added that run. It really is great. Portals of the present.
[8330.87s -> 8337.03s]  Are we already in the present? How does that make any sense? You cats ready to take a freaky
[8337.03s -> 8344.55s]  trip to the past? You bet. I want to rub my body all over Mary Curie and see if you'll glow in the
[8344.55s -> 8351.90s]  dark. That'd be neat too. Wow, man. We ain't going back that far though. Jump in. All right,
[8351.90s -> 8363.93s]  don't crash. Oh, we're back here. Here we are in your office in a not too distant past.
[8363.93s -> 8368.25s]  I remember this. This is when we had to retrieve the toy mafia's meatball sandwich
[8368.33s -> 8372.25s]  that Leonard tried to fence to Jimmy. Do we get to beat up Leonard some more?
[8372.25s -> 8378.49s]  No way, Max. These cats can't sense your presence in any way. Dick, you are here to
[8378.49s -> 8384.41s]  right a terrible wrong you once committed. We have to stop ourselves from doing yo mama jokes.
[8384.41s -> 8391.29s]  Just watch. See you around, sucker. Stop ourselves from doing karate jokes. Hello, guys?
[8391.85s -> 8399.66s]  Jimmy, anybody? Well, Jimmy, where's this big score that's going to change everything?
[8399.66s -> 8404.46s]  Where's all the money that's going to save our dear tiny Timmy? Yes, daddy,
[8404.46s -> 8410.30s]  where the **** is it? Oh, it's hopeless. The doctors say his Tourette syndrome will kill him
[8410.30s -> 8417.99s]  if they don't operate soon. Don't cry, mommy. I'll get the **** with the **** angels.
[8417.99s -> 8421.99s]  It's all a bust, Mary. Every time I try to make an honest living,
[8421.99s -> 8428.79s]  Sam and Max smack me down. Oh, ****. Jimmy, we were all counting on you.
[8428.79s -> 8435.99s]  I know, Mary, I know. If only I'd have stuck to boxing, I could have been somebody.
[8435.99s -> 8439.67s]  All right, so we got to be in a wreck, which is what I am.
[8439.67s -> 8443.03s]  Stop him from boxing? So get your lucky boxing glove and go fight.
[8444.23s -> 8450.55s]  I don't have it no more. Sam and Max took it. Again with Sam and Max. If you spend more
[8450.55s -> 8455.83s]  time boxing and this time sitting around watching TV, you'll be champ. They said,
[8455.83s -> 8462.55s]  Jimmy, you're a washout. Please don't fight mommy and daddy. Daddy's my hero.
[8462.55s -> 8469.11s]  This is bad. This is not good. Poor Jimmy.
[8480.28s -> 8486.02s]  Oh my God. I'll go call the doctor to ease his suffering.
[8486.02s -> 8490.42s]  Just get that glove, Jimmy. A baby doesn't have much time to live.
[8490.42s -> 8494.66s]  I can't say all that on TV. That's probably a $400,000 FCC fine.
[8494.66s -> 8497.06s]  You see what you gotta do. Beat up Leonard some more?
[8500.82s -> 8507.03s]  All right, so we have to. Jimmy, stop sitting around and get that glove.
[8507.03s -> 8512.90s]  We have to get the box. He has to be a boxer and boxer.
[8513.78s -> 8517.27s]  I gotta get the glove. So I have to give him the glove.
[8524.82s -> 8526.10s]  We can't interact with anybody, can we?
[8526.10s -> 8529.29s]  We've come back from the grave to haunt you.
[8529.29s -> 8533.13s]  He can't hear us, Max. Also, we're not dead yet.
[8537.90s -> 8541.18s]  Being hit with a bleak snowball at this range could cause permanent blindness.
[8542.06s -> 8544.06s]  I usually draw the line at temporary blindness.
[8544.06s -> 8547.42s]  We need to get the glove from Jimmy in the present to give to Jimmy in the past.
[8547.98s -> 8555.08s]  So we have to get Jimmy to not jump off the ledge to get the glove to bring to here.
[8559.66s -> 8561.58s]  The street looks a lot less destroyed.
[8565.24s -> 8568.36s]  All right, so how do I get the glove from Jimmy?
[8569.08s -> 8571.16s]  That's the real question. Hold on, can you tell me?
[8571.16s -> 8572.52s]  So what do we have to do?
[8572.52s -> 8576.04s]  Can't you brock the signal these cats are sending you, man?
[8576.04s -> 8580.68s]  The ailing child, the nagging old lady, the boxer who lost his mojo.
[8580.68s -> 8581.88s]  I have to go back and lose?
[8582.36s -> 8586.36s]  Trap traps? No, you gotta get him back in the ring.
[8586.36s -> 8587.40s]  Okay, get him a glove.
[8598.26s -> 8601.06s]  I know I have to stop him from suiciding, I know.
[8602.26s -> 8603.46s]  But the question is how?
[8604.10s -> 8605.62s]  You don't gotta all caps me.
[8606.34s -> 8608.10s]  I just said I knew that's what I had to do.
[8617.83s -> 8622.81s]  All right, so what does the present do?
[8623.62s -> 8630.10s]  Prepare yourselves for a journey beyond imagination as we enter the present.
[8638.97s -> 8643.37s]  Sam and Max, witness how your reckless carelessness hurts those in...
[8643.37s -> 8646.01s]  Hey, wait a second. This isn't the present.
[8646.01s -> 8647.21s]  You took us to the past.
[8647.77s -> 8649.29s]  Past us are standing right there.
[8649.29s -> 8649.85s]  Yeah, this is the past.
[8649.85s -> 8651.05s]  I know that.
[8651.05s -> 8653.13s]  Just give it a minute to catch up.
[8654.97s -> 8655.13s]  What?
[8655.13s -> 8659.13s]  That's the limited edition pestilence maquette with super detailed open sores.
[8659.85s -> 8662.01s]  Aw, see how he slumps in his saddle.
[8662.01s -> 8663.77s]  Does he have any cool action features?
[8663.77s -> 8666.41s]  Cut it out, Max. You don't know what that'll do.
[8666.41s -> 8668.25s]  What's the worst a toy could do?
[8668.33s -> 8670.33s]  Choke a toddler? Blind a toddler?
[8671.37s -> 8672.49s]  Inviscerate?
[8672.49s -> 8674.41s]  Well, it looks like nothing happened anyway.
[8674.41s -> 8674.89s]  Let's go.
[8675.85s -> 8676.49s]  Oh, no.
[8677.13s -> 8683.21s]  Seriously, we had a totally boss bug summoning toy and we wasted it on a stupid exorcism.
[8683.21s -> 8684.25s]  Teen hut!
[8684.25s -> 8685.61s]  That too, sergeant.
[8685.61s -> 8686.17s]  What?
[8686.17s -> 8688.17s]  How did you stink bugs find me?
[8688.17s -> 8689.37s]  This place is great.
[8690.01s -> 8692.65s]  Beaty brother too good to share with his family?
[8692.65s -> 8694.57s]  Too good to birth radio silent to cause this problem.
[8694.57s -> 8696.01s]  Another family problem.
[8696.01s -> 8697.93s]  Been on a work mission, ma'am.
[8697.93s -> 8701.13s]  Been hanging out with those filthy dungies more like me.
[8701.13s -> 8703.21s]  They don't even speak our language.
[8703.21s -> 8706.73s]  As long as my family's together again, I'm never leaving.
[8706.73s -> 8707.93s]  Mayday! Mayday!
[8707.93s -> 8709.45s]  Request immediate evac.
[8709.45s -> 8711.13s]  Immediate evac!
[8711.13s -> 8711.61s]  So what?
[8711.61s -> 8713.69s]  We have to rekindle the bugs' love for his family?
[8713.69s -> 8715.45s]  Teach them what they really mean to him?
[8715.45s -> 8716.25s]  Oh, my.
[8716.25s -> 8716.89s]  No fair.
[8716.89s -> 8718.17s]  Have you seen them?
[8718.17s -> 8719.61s]  They're awful.
[8719.61s -> 8721.93s]  You have to get rid of them.
[8721.93s -> 8722.73s]  Oh, boy.
[8722.73s -> 8724.33s]  I'll go get my stomping boots.
[8724.97s -> 8727.13s]  Non-violently.
[8728.09s -> 8728.57s]  All right.
[8732.31s -> 8733.03s]  Let me see.
[8733.03s -> 8738.47s]  We've got gift tags, simplest maze, and spirit bottle.
[8738.47s -> 8740.23s]  The maze has definitely put something here.
[8741.19s -> 8744.12s]  Can I like do something with the maze?
[8744.68s -> 8745.80s]  Not happening.
[8745.80s -> 8746.60s]  What do I do with the maze?
[8746.60s -> 8747.80s]  I've had it for a long time.
[8747.80s -> 8748.84s]  Hello, sir.
[8748.84s -> 8750.20s]  He can't hear us, Sam.
[8751.40s -> 8752.60s]  What is that?
[8752.60s -> 8754.68s]  It smells like wet ghost dog.
[8754.68s -> 8757.00s]  Maybe can I do the maze to the rats?
[8757.00s -> 8758.68s]  Well, I didn't think it was that funny.
[8758.68s -> 8760.28s]  But whatever turns you on.
[8760.28s -> 8761.16s]  I didn't say that.
[8761.16s -> 8761.80s]  The bug did.
[8763.00s -> 8764.52s]  What else is in here?
[8765.72s -> 8766.52s]  Hey, Sybil.
[8766.52s -> 8767.72s]  Oh, she can't hear us.
[8769.14s -> 8770.02s]  Hey, Abe.
[8770.02s -> 8771.14s]  Oh, he can't hear us.
[8773.14s -> 8777.74s]  Think it'd scare anyone if we started playing the jukebox?
[8777.74s -> 8778.62s]  Probably.
[8778.62s -> 8780.38s]  Your taste in music scares even me.
[8782.04s -> 8783.40s]  Can't change the channel.
[8784.20s -> 8787.11s]  Anything else over here?
[8791.48s -> 8792.44s]  Hey, Stinky.
[8792.44s -> 8793.56s]  Oh, she can't hear us.
[8794.20s -> 8799.35s]  All right.
[8799.35s -> 8801.27s]  Well, bug family.
[8802.15s -> 8803.75s]  Anybody else feel that?
[8803.75s -> 8804.39s]  Sure did.
[8805.19s -> 8808.17s]  Some kind of angry, violent presence.
[8808.17s -> 8810.09s]  And strangely familiar.
[8810.09s -> 8811.37s]  Is that you, Dad?
[8811.37s -> 8814.17s]  We haven't seen him since the attack of the cleaners.
[8814.17s -> 8815.53s]  Give us a sign, Father.
[8816.90s -> 8817.40s]  Okay.
[8818.84s -> 8822.36s]  So the idea here is, what if I just go back?
[8828.22s -> 8830.38s]  Maybe press the button on the...
[8830.38s -> 8831.82s]  No, but I don't have it there.
[8832.46s -> 8836.63s]  Let's go out of here.
[8837.43s -> 8840.02s]  Let me try the maze on the rat.
[8840.02s -> 8841.06s]  Why would that do anything, though?
[8841.54s -> 8847.22s]  The future doesn't...
[8847.22s -> 8847.86s]  There's nothing there.
[8851.11s -> 8852.15s]  I mean, I'm in the...
[8852.15s -> 8853.59s]  I can still do stuff now.
[8859.34s -> 8860.54s]  Let me just see what this does.
[8861.54s -> 8862.82s]  Look alive, Cheek.
[8862.82s -> 8864.26s]  Lead on, brother.
[8865.16s -> 8868.04s]  I'm gonna try just the maze here and see if I can put it down.
[8875.10s -> 8876.70s]  Jimmy, stop sitting around and get that glove.
[8876.70s -> 8878.38s]  Most rats would love a maze for Christmas.
[8878.38s -> 8878.62s]  No.
[8878.62s -> 8880.54s]  But this rat only wants his boxing glove.
[8885.46s -> 8889.08s]  Nope.
[8889.08s -> 8890.52s]  I gotta get him off the ledge.
[8891.24s -> 8891.96s]  The booze?
[8891.96s -> 8893.40s]  Maybe, like, how do I get him...
[8893.40s -> 8894.20s]  That's how I get the glove.
[8894.20s -> 8894.92s]  I need to get...
[8894.92s -> 8896.44s]  Go back to the reality here.
[8896.44s -> 8897.40s]  The real reality.
[8911.80s -> 8913.56s]  Can I give him, like, the booze?
[8914.44s -> 8917.72s]  Well, what is this thing?
[8917.72s -> 8919.16s]  Oh, that's the corporate presence.
[8919.16s -> 8921.00s]  Freelance police help spawn.
[8921.00s -> 8922.36s]  You're under arrest.
[8922.36s -> 8924.44s]  You have the right to remain viscous.
[8932.60s -> 8933.24s]  I mean, yeah.
[8933.24s -> 8934.84s]  You'd think the rat maze would do it, but...
[8937.85s -> 8938.65s]  I was clicking on Jimmy.
[8938.65s -> 8940.01s]  Can I click on the kid?
[8950.62s -> 8951.18s]  Jimmy.
[8951.18s -> 8952.14s]  Timmy this...
[8952.14s -> 8952.54s]  Here we go.
[8952.54s -> 8952.86s]  Hold on.
[8953.74s -> 8954.94s]  Timmy two teeth.
[8954.94s -> 8957.42s]  Rats do love mazes, but giving a dying kid
[8957.42s -> 8959.98s]  a cunningly disguised trap seems cruel.
[8966.39s -> 8968.23s]  Merry Christmas, Mrs. Two Teeth.
[8968.23s -> 8968.71s]  Come on.
[8968.71s -> 8970.63s]  We've got you the one gift every rat loves.
[8970.63s -> 8970.95s]  Really?
[8970.95s -> 8972.23s]  An impossible maze.
[8972.79s -> 8981.69s]  Yeah, I'm gonna get it.
[8981.69s -> 8982.73s]  So now in the...
[8982.73s -> 8985.13s]  I hope Mrs. Two Teeth appreciates the finest...
[8987.53s -> 8992.52s]  So now if I go into the present, is she gonna be in there?
[8996.74s -> 9000.02s]  And she's gonna come out and I'm gonna make her talk him off the ledge.
[9000.58s -> 9011.40s]  Let's see.
[9011.40s -> 9011.80s]  Hold on.
[9012.94s -> 9015.93s]  Where to, sir?
[9015.93s -> 9018.49s]  Let's head back to civilization, or what's left of it.
[9018.49s -> 9018.99s]  Good thing!
[9020.34s -> 9021.62s]  Let's see if she's in there.
[9030.18s -> 9048.82s]  Okay.
[9048.82s -> 9049.80s]  Now is this here?
[9055.19s -> 9055.83s]  It's not there!
[9056.39s -> 9057.91s]  We never should have let that deadbeat...
[9061.54s -> 9062.90s]  Wait, is he on the window?
[9064.39s -> 9065.19s]  I can't read...
[9065.19s -> 9066.07s]  We'll have to talk...
[9066.07s -> 9066.47s]  Wait a minute.
[9066.47s -> 9067.19s]  Wait, hold on a second.
[9067.19s -> 9067.43s]  Is he...
[9070.07s -> 9070.95s]  Was he on the window?
[9077.88s -> 9078.52s]  Fuck.
[9078.52s -> 9080.09s]  Didn't do it.
[9080.65s -> 9087.86s]  Wait, let me try to give him the...
[9087.86s -> 9088.82s]  What I was gonna try before.
[9088.82s -> 9089.46s]  Give him the booze.
[9093.26s -> 9093.74s]  You want this?
[9094.46s -> 9095.34s]  Nothing doing.
[9095.34s -> 9099.21s]  No.
[9099.53s -> 9102.25s]  It's the guy that did something through the maze and the boxing club.
[9102.25s -> 9103.21s]  The wife and the...
[9103.93s -> 9109.67s]  Where to, Sam?
[9110.39s -> 9113.18s]  Can I just...
[9113.18s -> 9113.50s]  Wait, hold on.
[9113.50s -> 9114.06s]  Let me talk to him.
[9114.62s -> 9116.98s]  Because I did place it.
[9117.78s -> 9119.29s]  Oh, that was a big one.
[9119.29s -> 9120.41s]  I'm gonna do it!
[9120.41s -> 9121.77s]  I'll jump, I tell ya!
[9121.77s -> 9122.73s]  Hang on a second, Jimmy.
[9125.62s -> 9126.98s]  Smile, Jimmy.
[9126.98s -> 9127.38s]  What about...
[9128.74s -> 9129.78s]  Smile, Jimmy?
[9129.78s -> 9130.18s]  What is it?
[9130.18s -> 9130.58s]  Look on the...
[9131.86s -> 9133.78s]  Turn that frown upside down.
[9133.78s -> 9135.94s]  That nonsense ain't helping.
[9135.94s -> 9136.82s]  Sorry, Jimmy.
[9136.82s -> 9140.42s]  It's just that suicide is too horrible for me to even contemplate.
[9140.42s -> 9142.26s]  Even though we'd all be happier if you were dead.
[9143.94s -> 9144.74s]  So there's no, like...
[9144.74s -> 9145.54s]  What about your wife?
[9145.54s -> 9148.74s]  No wife, no family, no job.
[9148.74s -> 9150.42s]  What right side?
[9150.42s -> 9152.66s]  Well, with all the brain damage you got from boxing,
[9152.66s -> 9154.58s]  you'd make a great bacon-eyed janitor.
[9155.78s -> 9156.50s]  Nuts.
[9156.50s -> 9158.74s]  My boxing career didn't even last long enough
[9158.74s -> 9160.82s]  to give me a decent case of brain damage.
[9162.92s -> 9165.56s]  You know your wife's gonna give you hell if you kill yourself.
[9165.56s -> 9166.52s]  Mary!
[9166.52s -> 9167.32s]  She left me!
[9167.96s -> 9169.64s]  You're overreacting, Jimmy.
[9169.64s -> 9170.76s]  You think?
[9170.76s -> 9171.24s]  Sure.
[9171.24s -> 9173.64s]  Your wife probably never really loved you in the first place.
[9175.00s -> 9176.22s]  I gotta get the glove.
[9176.22s -> 9176.54s]  It's...
[9176.54s -> 9177.42s]  We're in a paradox.
[9177.42s -> 9180.22s]  I have to get the glove to give him a pass so he boxes,
[9180.22s -> 9181.90s]  but I need to keep the wife there
[9181.90s -> 9184.06s]  so he doesn't end up going down the path.
[9185.18s -> 9186.70s]  Max, I don't think this is helping.
[9186.70s -> 9187.26s]  I disagree.
[9189.61s -> 9191.05s]  We gotta break the loop here.
[9191.77s -> 9194.39s]  How do I get his wife to...
[9196.79s -> 9200.76s]  What is the point of the trap?
[9201.72s -> 9202.44s]  Hold on.
[9202.44s -> 9204.57s]  We're off to the North Pole.
[9214.20s -> 9215.40s]  Am I missing something here?
[9220.70s -> 9225.40s]  Because at present, the trap is that I have this alcohol.
[9226.36s -> 9229.06s]  I have a snowball.
[9229.70s -> 9231.38s]  The family is just out there.
[9233.08s -> 9235.64s]  How do I get the wife to go into the maze?
[9236.52s -> 9242.89s]  How are we doing on fuel?
[9242.89s -> 9245.08s]  It's running low on coal.
[9245.88s -> 9247.58s]  I can't take anything from that.
[9247.58s -> 9248.14s]  All right, hold on.
[9249.58s -> 9250.54s]  Let's go back in here.
[9254.65s -> 9256.41s]  Let's exhaust some options in here.
[9272.14s -> 9272.78s]  She's talking.
[9277.14s -> 9277.62s]  Take the coat.
[9277.62s -> 9278.42s]  It's always the coat hanger.
[9291.91s -> 9292.55s]  Is that really it?
[9295.91s -> 9296.63s]  What?
[9296.63s -> 9297.03s]  That is...
[9299.67s -> 9300.55s]  We can work it out.
[9301.27s -> 9302.47s]  I just took his wife.
[9303.35s -> 9304.23s]  She left me.
[9304.87s -> 9306.71s]  Now I'll never see her again.
[9308.63s -> 9309.51s]  I know, son.
[9310.07s -> 9310.55s]  I know.
[9314.82s -> 9315.14s]  Okay.
[9316.28s -> 9319.62s]  So now we go to the present.
[9319.62s -> 9321.22s]  We put the wife down.
[9322.02s -> 9326.90s]  We show them that we let the wife out.
[9334.98s -> 9335.78s]  Okay.
[9335.78s -> 9338.42s]  I guess we're just gonna hold her up and be like,
[9338.42s -> 9339.06s]  here she is.
[9339.54s -> 9345.64s]  Oh, no.
[9345.64s -> 9345.96s]  Yeah.
[9345.96s -> 9347.16s]  This is how she left.
[9348.82s -> 9349.62s]  Oh, shit.
[9350.18s -> 9352.42s]  I told you this is time travel.
[9357.40s -> 9358.20s]  We took her.
[9364.95s -> 9365.67s]  Oh, wow.
[9367.74s -> 9368.06s]  Okay.
[9368.06s -> 9368.54s]  Here we go.
[9369.70s -> 9369.94s]  Look.
[9388.26s -> 9393.06s]  Oh.
[9393.06s -> 9395.46s]  I hope he takes the glove off and it's a huge fucking human hand.
[9412.42s -> 9412.92s]  Got it.
[9418.82s -> 9422.66s]  Oh, my God.
[9423.30s -> 9424.26s]  That was awful.
[9427.35s -> 9428.47s]  Why did you do that?
[9436.46s -> 9437.18s]  Give him the glove.
[9441.02s -> 9441.58s]  Why not?
[9441.58s -> 9441.82s]  Yeah.
[9447.40s -> 9447.96s]  Let's go.
[9448.76s -> 9461.08s]  Here you go.
[9462.47s -> 9463.67s]  Now be the best boxer ever.
[9463.67s -> 9465.03s]  And then we're gonna lose to him.
[9466.57s -> 9467.05s]  Probably not.
[9467.05s -> 9469.37s]  This is probably just as simple as clicking on you and then we win.
[9471.67s -> 9472.15s]  Excuse me.
[9472.15s -> 9472.39s]  Makes.
[9472.39s -> 9472.95s]  Get out of the way.
[9472.95s -> 9473.59s]  Thank you, makes.
[9478.62s -> 9478.86s]  What?
[9479.42s -> 9480.46s]  Could it be true?
[9481.27s -> 9486.23s]  Timmy, look, it's your pa's lucky boxing glove.
[9486.23s -> 9489.58s]  Where the fuck did that come from, daddy?
[9489.58s -> 9491.10s]  I don't know, son.
[9491.10s -> 9494.14s]  All I know is I finally got a second chance.
[9494.78s -> 9497.78s]  It's a fucking Christmas miracle.
[9497.78s -> 9498.42s]  Stop that.
[9499.54s -> 9502.90s]  I ain't never gonna get anything out of my sight again.
[9502.90s -> 9504.34s]  Now, come on, son.
[9504.34s -> 9506.66s]  No squares are allowed on Twitch.
[9506.66s -> 9508.82s]  And get you that operation.
[9511.64s -> 9513.40s]  Way to go, dudes.
[9513.40s -> 9515.08s]  You saved Christmas past.
[9515.80s -> 9518.60s]  So let's move on back to the present.
[9520.84s -> 9524.09s]  The rats made you and the rats will destroy you.
[9528.82s -> 9534.10s]  Sam and Max, you made up for your past and helped Jimmy find his way.
[9534.10s -> 9536.18s]  Now for your reward.
[9536.18s -> 9538.50s]  Your eternal reward.
[9538.50s -> 9542.98s]  I'm just gonna chill in this bottle until you're ready to unleash all three of us
[9542.98s -> 9544.90s]  cats on that fascist demon.
[9546.58s -> 9547.22s]  Nope.
[9553.40s -> 9555.64s]  Okay, so we have done that.
[9555.64s -> 9557.80s]  We now have one spirit in the bottle.
[9558.36s -> 9559.80s]  We now have to figure out this shit.
[9560.92s -> 9567.64s]  Which is we've got the future, which is just standing there.
[9567.64s -> 9569.24s]  That didn't really do anything for us.
[9569.24s -> 9571.56s]  That just closed up that little port of the present.
[9572.12s -> 9578.57s]  Let's go back to the future and see.
[9579.37s -> 9581.37s]  Ready to hit the future again, Max?
[9581.37s -> 9582.49s]  Go ahead without me.
[9582.49s -> 9583.53s]  I'll catch up.
[9583.53s -> 9584.41s]  Just get in here.
[9585.21s -> 9590.78s]  Bottle of spirits.
[9590.78s -> 9592.14s]  I get it because alcohol is scary.
[9592.14s -> 9593.18s]  Why are you capsing me right now?
[9593.18s -> 9594.38s]  We still haven't escaped yet?
[9595.02s -> 9596.38s]  I'm disappointed.
[9596.38s -> 9599.50s]  It's people like us that give people like us a bad name.
[9603.53s -> 9604.57s]  There's nothing else in here.
[9606.14s -> 9607.42s]  Jimmy didn't do something different.
[9614.33s -> 9617.93s]  I'd better start dieting now if I want to be in shape for my inevitable death.
[9617.93s -> 9619.21s]  Can I throw a snowball at myself?
[9620.84s -> 9622.04s]  Hey there, sexy.
[9622.04s -> 9627.59s]  I'll be back to pick you up later.
[9627.59s -> 9629.35s]  Being hit with a bleached snowball at this time.
[9629.83s -> 9639.59s]  I don't think I can do anything.
[9639.59s -> 9641.27s]  I need an item or something.
[9641.27s -> 9645.24s]  What happens if you kill yourself in the future?
[9646.92s -> 9653.03s]  Can you tell us what to do in charades?
[9653.03s -> 9653.59s]  Is that it?
[9654.95s -> 9655.35s]  Nothing.
[9656.95s -> 9657.59s]  Okay, okay.
[9657.59s -> 9659.91s]  One word sounds like fiery death.
[9662.89s -> 9665.21s]  I'm skipping the text we've heard three times already.
[9667.14s -> 9668.18s]  I better start dieting.
[9669.06s -> 9671.30s]  Are you mad that you don't get to hear that an eighth time?
[9671.86s -> 9674.62s]  What if I didn't hear that one?
[9674.62s -> 9675.02s]  Yeah, I did.
[9684.25s -> 9685.61s]  Skipping the fight.
[9685.61s -> 9686.73s]  It was the shooting one.
[9687.53s -> 9688.57s]  Oh, well, whatever.
[9690.84s -> 9692.28s]  Santa's coal powered sleigh.
[9694.22s -> 9694.86s]  Santa's coal.
[9696.86s -> 9697.18s]  Coal?
[9699.18s -> 9700.46s]  It's running low on coal.
[9700.46s -> 9701.18s]  I need coal.
[9704.14s -> 9706.70s]  Can I dump this guy's energy in here?
[9708.63s -> 9708.95s]  Coal?
[9710.23s -> 9711.80s]  Where do I get coal?
[9711.80s -> 9713.40s]  I gotta get from the stockings.
[9717.58s -> 9717.98s]  Wait a minute.
[9717.98s -> 9718.46s]  Get out of my way.
[9718.46s -> 9719.18s]  Let me go over here.
[9733.00s -> 9735.00s]  So you're telling me this was for nothing?
[9736.73s -> 9739.77s]  This trampoline cannon toy bomber thing?
[9739.77s -> 9741.29s]  I don't have to even use right now?
[9742.01s -> 9743.83s]  It was for nothing.
[9745.27s -> 9746.31s]  They set this up.
[9746.31s -> 9749.11s]  I took like 30 to 40 minutes in the beginning of this stream
[9749.11s -> 9750.31s]  trying to figure out how to do this.
[9751.03s -> 9754.49s]  I can't be right.
[9754.49s -> 9759.70s]  It was just for fun.
[9759.70s -> 9760.26s]  Well, whatever.
[9760.26s -> 9761.30s]  Okay, that's cool.
[9762.02s -> 9764.04s]  All right, where is it?
[9764.04s -> 9765.16s]  Stocking stuffer.
[9765.16s -> 9766.04s]  Look at this.
[9766.04s -> 9768.20s]  It's Santa's magical stocking stuffer.
[9768.20s -> 9769.08s]  So the sock.
[9769.08s -> 9771.56s]  With whatever gift the owner deserves.
[9771.56s -> 9773.00s]  Oh, let's try it.
[9773.00s -> 9774.60s]  I think we need to have socks first.
[9774.60s -> 9775.88s]  So we have to get a pair of socks.
[9777.40s -> 9780.07s]  Where can I get socks?
[9780.87s -> 9783.85s]  I need a pair of socks.
[9784.65s -> 9788.12s]  Santa doesn't have socks lying around here somewhere.
[9788.68s -> 9792.12s]  Okay.
[9800.54s -> 9803.80s]  Are the Curly Larry and Moe still out there?
[9803.80s -> 9804.28s]  Whatever they are.
[9805.16s -> 9807.94s]  No, no socks here.
[9813.94s -> 9814.18s]  No.
[9814.90s -> 9834.12s]  Are these little weirdos over here still?
[9834.12s -> 9836.76s]  No, they're gone.
[9836.76s -> 9837.16s]  Socks.
[9838.46s -> 9839.34s]  We're gonna get a pair of socks.
[9839.34s -> 9841.82s]  Let us return to the present.
[9842.62s -> 9850.57s]  Off topic, but how much?
[9850.57s -> 9851.05s]  Never mind.
[9852.34s -> 9853.46s]  That's very off topic.
[9853.46s -> 9854.34s]  That's so off topic.
[9854.34s -> 9855.54s]  That's not even like I'm not.
[9855.54s -> 9857.46s]  Why would I would never would read that?
[9858.10s -> 9858.42s]  Okay.
[9859.06s -> 9859.78s]  Just what we need.
[9860.50s -> 9868.65s]  I mean, there was a feet command here.
[9869.59s -> 9870.47s]  Hey, stinky.
[9870.47s -> 9871.67s]  Oh, she can't hear us.
[9872.31s -> 9873.27s]  No, it's in the other.
[9873.27s -> 9873.99s]  No, I gotta go back.
[9881.34s -> 9882.54s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[9882.54s -> 9883.18s]  That's the only.
[9884.30s -> 9885.58s]  Is she even wearing socks?
[9888.41s -> 9890.01s]  Why would I go to them?
[9890.01s -> 9891.13s]  Why would I go up to her and be like,
[9891.13s -> 9893.61s]  Hey, can I have your socks?
[9898.47s -> 9898.71s]  No.
[9904.06s -> 9905.58s]  They're for a quest.
[9907.00s -> 9907.40s]  Okay.
[9909.30s -> 9910.58s]  It's adorable.
[9910.58s -> 9912.90s]  I think it might be a warning, Sam.
[9912.90s -> 9913.94s]  Still adorable.
[9926.01s -> 9926.49s]  Hold on.
[9927.80s -> 9929.16s]  Where to, Sam?
[9929.16s -> 9930.52s]  Is that really what it is?
[9930.52s -> 9931.56s]  Let's head back to.
[9931.56s -> 9932.28s]  Good thinking.
[9934.42s -> 9954.65s]  I thought about the bugs.
[9957.18s -> 9957.98s]  Bug family.
[9958.78s -> 9966.47s]  Come here.
[9966.47s -> 9967.59s]  Let's let's talk about this.
[9969.78s -> 9971.46s]  Standing up all day, getting you down.
[9971.46s -> 9974.98s]  And how I was made for sunning beach sunning.
[9975.86s -> 9978.90s]  Not slinging hashed counter side for a pack of ingrates.
[9979.86s -> 9981.06s]  This doesn't mean anything.
[9981.94s -> 9984.02s]  Any tips on dealing with cockroaches?
[9984.02s -> 9985.30s]  That depends.
[9985.30s -> 9988.42s]  If they're in the soup, just scoop them out.
[9988.42s -> 9991.86s]  If they're on the pizza, it's easier just to eat around them.
[9994.42s -> 9995.06s]  Um, okay.
[9996.25s -> 9996.73s]  So long.
[10004.63s -> 10005.43s]  Bug family.
[10005.43s -> 10006.07s]  Hello, sir.
[10006.87s -> 10010.31s]  What happened to your dad?
[10010.31s -> 10011.51s]  You really want to know?
[10012.15s -> 10013.19s]  No, not really.
[10013.19s -> 10014.79s]  It was our toughest battle yet.
[10014.79s -> 10017.67s]  We secured our positions in a heavily fortified dumpster.
[10017.67s -> 10020.87s]  When suddenly they came out of nowhere.
[10020.87s -> 10021.83s]  Who?
[10021.83s -> 10023.59s]  The cleaning crew.
[10023.59s -> 10025.35s]  Cleaning crew.
[10025.35s -> 10027.51s]  Attacking with sanitation.
[10027.51s -> 10029.35s]  That's just plain dirty.
[10029.35s -> 10031.11s]  Get stinky socks.
[10031.11s -> 10032.39s]  Overpowering.
[10032.39s -> 10033.27s]  We all would have gotten.
[10033.27s -> 10033.67s]  I don't.
[10033.67s -> 10035.75s]  I think I'm getting, like, baited.
[10035.75s -> 10037.59s]  I still remember his last words.
[10038.31s -> 10039.83s]  Move out, maggots.
[10039.83s -> 10041.03s]  God, he was concise.
[10042.31s -> 10043.03s]  Cleaning.
[10043.03s -> 10043.67s]  Every time.
[10044.39s -> 10045.59s]  Every time?
[10047.99s -> 10048.79s]  I know what to do.
[10054.39s -> 10055.67s]  Can't you get your family to leave?
[10056.63s -> 10059.35s]  This sorry regiment never listens to me.
[10059.35s -> 10061.59s]  These half-wits would only listen to my father.
[10061.59s -> 10063.67s]  God rest his exoskeleton.
[10065.24s -> 10066.12s]  Goodbye.
[10066.12s -> 10066.68s]  Keep them dead.
[10067.64s -> 10071.11s]  Being hit with a bleached snowball at this rate.
[10071.11s -> 10071.43s]  No.
[10072.79s -> 10073.19s]  And?
[10073.75s -> 10075.43s]  That was so clever.
[10076.31s -> 10076.63s]  Really?
[10079.54s -> 10082.42s]  I think I'll save my snowball for a more satisfying target.
[10084.30s -> 10084.86s]  No.
[10084.86s -> 10086.89s]  That's not it?
[10089.59s -> 10091.43s]  But where's the, where's the watering can?
[10092.07s -> 10100.47s]  Can I throw it at the different time period?
[10100.47s -> 10115.42s]  In the, at the.
[10115.42s -> 10116.38s]  Where to, Sam?
[10117.34s -> 10119.34s]  We're off to the North Pole.
[10124.66s -> 10128.89s]  Let's see if I can do it in the other presence.
[10145.62s -> 10146.74s]  Okay, so now.
[10147.70s -> 10149.50s]  To containment.
[10149.50s -> 10150.62s]  No, no, no, I know, I know, I know.
[10155.58s -> 10156.06s]  Got it.
[10156.06s -> 10156.56s]  Whoa!
[10157.26s -> 10159.18s]  Cleaning crews on all sides.
[10159.18s -> 10161.18s]  Father, it is you.
[10161.18s -> 10163.26s]  The butterflies are pinned down!
[10163.26s -> 10164.86s]  Move out, maggots!
[10164.86s -> 10166.06s]  Sir, yes, sir!
[10166.06s -> 10167.18s]  Company, march!
[10169.86s -> 10171.46s]  What in tarnation?
[10171.46s -> 10172.66s]  My family!
[10172.66s -> 10175.54s]  Imagine taking this long to beat a putt-putt spinoff?
[10176.26s -> 10177.38s]  Well done.
[10177.38s -> 10179.30s]  Now, let us return.
[10179.30s -> 10179.86s]  Get over it.
[10179.86s -> 10181.46s]  To the present.
[10188.44s -> 10193.16s]  I must admit your obedience was acceptable.
[10193.16s -> 10195.32s]  I suppose I can help you after all.
[10195.88s -> 10196.84s]  Forget that!
[10196.84s -> 10198.20s]  You gotta send me back!
[10198.20s -> 10200.44s]  I wasn't done haunting people yet!
[10200.44s -> 10202.52s]  Oh, Max.
[10202.52s -> 10206.12s]  You and Sam will be dead soon enough.
[10206.12s -> 10206.92s]  I'll wait in the-
[10206.92s -> 10207.96s]  What is this? What are you linking?
[10207.96s -> 10209.40s]  I've saw, I've seen that already.
[10209.40s -> 10214.76s]  Hold until you're prepared to release all three of us to smite the demon.
[10220.07s -> 10221.27s]  Alright, socks.
[10221.27s -> 10223.51s]  We need a pair of socks.
[10223.51s -> 10228.23s]  I'm excited, disappointed, over-socialized, and more than a little gassy.
[10228.23s -> 10231.24s]  Get me back to the sock machine.
[10231.88s -> 10242.33s]  It was a bunch of bullshit.
[10242.33s -> 10245.93s]  You guys just wanted me to say the word, like, feet and stinky.
[10246.65s -> 10248.90s]  Together.
[10248.90s -> 10249.62s]  And it worked.
[10249.62s -> 10250.66s]  You did a very good job.
[10252.87s -> 10254.71s]  You did a great, great work.
[10255.35s -> 10261.67s]  Here, print out.
[10261.67s -> 10262.47s]  Candle hell.
[10262.47s -> 10263.03s]  Deceased.
[10263.67s -> 10265.11s]  Sock full of flowers.
[10265.11s -> 10266.23s]  Richard N.
[10266.23s -> 10266.63s]  Liar.
[10267.19s -> 10268.07s]  Sock full of coal.
[10269.82s -> 10270.62s]  Richard.
[10270.62s -> 10271.18s]  Jason B.
[10271.82s -> 10272.70s]  Liar.
[10272.70s -> 10273.98s]  Sock full of coal.
[10273.98s -> 10274.94s]  Patches.
[10274.94s -> 10275.82s]  Good boy.
[10275.82s -> 10276.30s]  Patches.
[10276.30s -> 10277.18s]  Sock full of chew toys.
[10277.82s -> 10279.26s]  Dr. Catherine D.
[10279.26s -> 10280.30s]  Upstanding citizen.
[10280.86s -> 10281.82s]  Sock full of toys.
[10282.22s -> 10283.42s]  George W.
[10283.42s -> 10284.30s]  Liar.
[10284.30s -> 10285.18s]  Sock full of coal.
[10286.06s -> 10287.18s]  Annabelle L.
[10287.18s -> 10287.90s]  Deceased.
[10287.90s -> 10288.22s]  Okay.
[10288.22s -> 10288.94s]  Richard N.
[10289.90s -> 10290.86s]  I don't think that matters.
[10305.27s -> 10307.51s]  Ahhhh, god.
[10309.18s -> 10313.00s]  Damn it.
[10313.00s -> 10315.00s]  It's a torture me Elmer doll.
[10315.00s -> 10319.40s]  Look, he comes with his own breakable spirit and detachable retinas.
[10322.86s -> 10324.22s]  It couldn't have been that easy, right?
[10325.91s -> 10326.95s]  I need socks.
[10327.67s -> 10329.48s]  I need socks.
[10329.56s -> 10333.08s]  I need to find a sock to put the coal in so I can power the sleigh so I can...
[10336.47s -> 10338.79s]  I'm just gonna go back to the real world.
[10342.60s -> 10343.40s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[10343.40s -> 10344.44s]  Can you get socks from...
[10344.44s -> 10344.76s]  Hold on.
[10344.76s -> 10346.44s]  There's actual toys in here.
[10346.44s -> 10372.17s]  Computer.
[10372.17s -> 10373.93s]  Foot bath and piranha query.
[10374.73s -> 10376.49s]  Too bad the piranha are sold separately.
[10377.13s -> 10378.33s]  Let's attach a gift tag.
[10381.13s -> 10381.85s]  Who's it for?
[10384.49s -> 10385.53s]  Stinky might like that.
[10391.34s -> 10391.98s]  Quick, run!
[10392.62s -> 10401.82s]  Joke's on you.
[10401.82s -> 10403.34s]  The chat wasn't being creepy.
[10403.98s -> 10404.70s]  Well, they were.
[10404.70s -> 10405.18s]  They were.
[10405.18s -> 10405.90s]  Very much so.
[10406.70s -> 10408.22s]  But I thought I was getting...
[10408.22s -> 10410.14s]  I thought it was like a defeat meme on Switch.
[10411.02s -> 10411.74s]  Apparently not.
[10412.55s -> 10414.15s]  Let's head back to civilization.
[10414.15s -> 10415.11s]  Or what's left of it.
[10417.08s -> 10421.32s]  I was trying so hard to think of another solution around that.
[10421.32s -> 10423.08s]  But it actually was the solution.
[10423.08s -> 10424.52s]  Because I thought everybody was just doing like,
[10424.52s -> 10425.56s]  Yeah, she's got feet.
[10425.56s -> 10426.06s]  She's...
[10426.76s -> 10433.96s]  It's this way.
[10439.08s -> 10440.36s]  That's gonna be like on the counter.
[10440.36s -> 10443.80s]  Oh, that foot bath was heavy.
[10443.80s -> 10448.28s]  My feet haven't felt that good since that hot oil massage from Barack Obama.
[10448.28s -> 10450.44s]  It smells like you've got a new item on the menu, too.
[10451.00s -> 10455.80s]  Now I can find the strength to keep serving these poor sweet spoiled imbeciles.
[10462.25s -> 10464.25s]  This smelly old sock could come in handy.
[10484.20s -> 10486.44s]  That was the thing that I thought was never gonna happen
[10486.44s -> 10488.36s]  because everyone was saying it was gonna happen.
[10488.92s -> 10490.04s]  Where to, Sam?
[10490.04s -> 10492.44s]  I was trying to just subvert it so much.
[10494.97s -> 10495.37s]  Oh well.
[10495.37s -> 10496.81s]  We're off to the North Pole.
[10497.77s -> 10508.82s]  See you guys.
[10517.51s -> 10519.51s]  Chad is becoming the voice in Jerma's head
[10519.51s -> 10521.43s]  that is always right that he never believes.
[10532.07s -> 10533.11s]  Always right.
[10533.11s -> 10533.61s]  Okay.
[10536.20s -> 10539.16s]  Hang back on the extreme backpack there.
[10540.73s -> 10541.85s]  Always right.
[10562.98s -> 10564.50s]  At least one guy is right in Chad.
[10564.50s -> 10565.14s]  At all times.
[10567.14s -> 10567.94s]  Yeah, I mean that's...
[10568.66s -> 10571.38s]  But you're just talking about like a sample statistic here.
[10572.87s -> 10574.95s]  There's 3,000 people here.
[10576.18s -> 10577.62s]  Somebody's gonna be right.
[10577.62s -> 10579.46s]  At least 10 of you.
[10579.46s -> 10580.42s]  100 of you, maybe.
[10583.53s -> 10584.09s]  What do you mean?
[10585.21s -> 10586.81s]  If you get a thousand people in a room
[10586.81s -> 10588.49s]  and you ask them all a hard question,
[10588.49s -> 10590.17s]  at least a dozen of them will get it right.
[10593.88s -> 10594.44s]  So Chad is...
[10594.44s -> 10596.36s]  No, some of Chad is always right.
[10597.00s -> 10598.84s]  Most of Chad is always wrong.
[10606.82s -> 10607.54s]  That's true.
[10608.50s -> 10610.26s]  Some of Chad is right
[10610.26s -> 10612.26s]  and most of Chad is wrong.
[10612.26s -> 10612.50s]  Right?
[10615.80s -> 10616.52s]  I'm not...
[10616.52s -> 10618.12s]  Think about how many times you've said something
[10618.12s -> 10619.16s]  that it was correct.
[10620.12s -> 10621.96s]  You're one of like the 20 to 30 percent
[10621.96s -> 10622.76s]  that gets it right.
[10638.65s -> 10640.33s]  We need more research for that conclusion.
[10645.83s -> 10648.07s]  What an unexpected stroke of luck.
[10648.07s -> 10649.75s]  Is this another mastermind thing?
[10650.63s -> 10652.39s]  Well, you're talking mega-line.
[10652.39s -> 10653.59s]  An effort to save Christmas
[10653.59s -> 10656.31s]  and drove it recklessly into a hellish vision of the future
[10656.31s -> 10658.55s]  very much like the one we're standing in now.
[10658.55s -> 10661.35s]  I stopped paying attention halfway through that sentence.
[10661.35s -> 10664.39s]  I wonder if our ghosts are here guiding us right now.
[10664.39s -> 10665.99s]  Hey, past me!
[10665.99s -> 10667.43s]  Check this out!
[10667.43s -> 10668.39s]  Shake that thing!
[10669.11s -> 10671.03s]  Classy as always, little pal.
[10671.03s -> 10672.15s]  Now let's get out of here.
[10673.51s -> 10676.28s]  We get it.
[10676.36s -> 10680.76s]  I have closed all outlying portals.
[10681.90s -> 10684.38s]  Hey, you could stand to lose a few yourself, smart guy.
[10689.98s -> 10691.66s]  Chad is always right.
[10693.22s -> 10694.26s]  Right, if you could say that.
[10694.26s -> 10696.34s]  We saved Christmas for our future selves.
[10696.34s -> 10697.86s]  Chad collectively is...
[10697.86s -> 10699.86s]  Some of them will be right, so Chad would be right.
[10701.26s -> 10702.94s]  But that's not how it works.
[10702.94s -> 10705.26s]  That means he'll help us take care of our demon problem.
[10705.26s -> 10706.14s]  What's he gonna do?
[10706.14s -> 10707.58s]  Give him the silent treatment?
[10708.30s -> 10711.64s]  Oh, stop!
[10712.33s -> 10712.83s]  Hey!
[10713.53s -> 10715.53s]  Never underestimate the power of passive aggression.
[10715.53s -> 10717.29s]  But that would also make Chad wrong, too.
[10717.85s -> 10720.65s]  Yes, Chad is right and wrong at the same time.
[10725.27s -> 10727.03s]  By the way, opinions are not facts.
[10727.03s -> 10727.59s]  Let's just get that.
[10727.59s -> 10729.19s]  So, Jerma is short.
[10729.19s -> 10730.31s]  Oh, we can all agree on that.
[10730.31s -> 10731.27s]  That's an opinion of yours.
[10732.60s -> 10736.86s]  If somebody was like 5'5", or like 5'2",
[10737.58s -> 10738.78s]  I would be taller than them
[10738.78s -> 10741.50s]  and they wouldn't think I was short.
[10741.50s -> 10742.46s]  So, that's an...
[10742.46s -> 10748.78s]  If I went to like a village of people that were like 2' tall at some point,
[10748.78s -> 10750.79s]  I don't know, I would be tall.
[10750.79s -> 10751.51s]  That would be their opinion.
[10751.51s -> 10752.47s]  Oh, you're kind of tall.
[10753.80s -> 10755.40s]  So, that's an opinion of yours.
[10755.40s -> 10756.28s]  That's not a fact.
[10761.50s -> 10763.02s]  So, I have all the Christmas spirits.
[10765.02s -> 10765.90s]  Hey, demon!
[10765.90s -> 10766.54s]  Cut that out!
[10777.99s -> 10779.99s]  I was supposed to take the spirits and...
[10779.99s -> 10781.51s]  What was I supposed to do with them?
[10781.51s -> 10782.23s]  Give them to Santa?
[10785.21s -> 10785.69s]  What are you doing?
[10785.69s -> 10786.09s]  I just...
[10786.09s -> 10786.81s]  We were talking about...
[10788.33s -> 10790.62s]  We were talking about shitting.
[10805.80s -> 10807.50s]  What are you doing in the game?
[10807.50s -> 10808.14s]  Yeah, we were talking.
[10808.14s -> 10808.70s]  I wasn't like...
[10808.70s -> 10811.18s]  I was focusing on speaking about opinions.
[10813.90s -> 10815.10s]  What size shoe do you wear?
[10815.10s -> 10815.60s]  14.
[10833.74s -> 10835.10s]  Happy New Year, everybody.
[10837.61s -> 10840.97s]  Well, I hope you boys have learned your lesson.
[10840.97s -> 10842.65s]  It was a series of honest mistakes.
[10843.45s -> 10847.37s]  Keep us on the nice list and nobody has to see this videotape of you
[10847.37s -> 10849.77s]  wetting yourself and screaming like a campfire girl.
[10851.21s -> 10853.05s]  You rapscallions!
[10853.05s -> 10855.69s]  Rattle on to bed, both of you!
[10855.69s -> 10859.05s]  Ready for visions of sugar plums to dance in your head, little buddy?
[10859.05s -> 10860.65s]  It'd be better than the night terrace.
[10860.65s -> 10861.37s]  I got a size 10.
[10861.37s -> 10863.29s]  Ho, ho, ho!
[10863.29s -> 10864.09s]  Jello!
[10864.73s -> 10865.61s]  Sinful.
[10866.57s -> 10867.37s]  Santa!
[10868.09s -> 10868.57s]  No!
[10868.57s -> 10869.07s]  Uh-oh.
[10872.20s -> 10874.20s]  Eat the jello!
[10877.66s -> 10879.51s]  That feels so good.
[10882.36s -> 10887.45s]  So wait, that was all for nothing?
[10888.09s -> 10889.77s]  The whole episode was for no reason?
[10903.27s -> 10904.87s]  All right, this is where it comes in play here.
[10909.11s -> 10913.98s]  Okay, yep, we planned for this.
[10915.21s -> 10918.65s]  So we've got to move this over there.
[10921.35s -> 10922.63s]  And then we've got to move this.
[10925.35s -> 10927.75s]  We've got to move that.
[10927.75s -> 10928.71s]  Shoot that.
[10928.71s -> 10929.59s]  Drop it on his head.
[10929.59s -> 10930.31s]  Trampoline.
[10931.03s -> 10934.86s]  We've got to get that.
[10934.86s -> 10937.26s]  We've got to move this over here.
[10937.90s -> 10939.34s]  Stop it over the trampoline.
[10941.72s -> 10943.00s]  And then shoot it with a cannon.
[10944.31s -> 10945.43s]  And the cannon's going to break that.
[10945.43s -> 10947.03s]  It's going to bounce and hit him in the head.
[10947.03s -> 10947.91s]  No, it's not.
[10947.91s -> 10949.75s]  What we've got to do here is we've got to shoot this.
[10951.03s -> 10956.06s]  Shoot the, uh, I've got to, how do I move the cannon?
[10965.03s -> 10965.51s]  Gift.
[10965.51s -> 10966.71s]  Christmas present.
[10966.71s -> 10968.38s]  We've got to shoot.
[10971.18s -> 10971.68s]  Oops.
[10972.66s -> 10973.54s]  Shoot the present.
[10973.54s -> 10974.66s]  Onto the trampoline.
[10975.88s -> 10976.60s]  Oh, fuck.
[10977.86s -> 10979.94s]  Shoot the, shoot the cannon.
[10979.94s -> 10980.74s]  Shoot the present.
[10980.74s -> 10981.38s]  Present.
[10981.38s -> 10981.94s]  Explodes.
[10982.82s -> 10987.02s]  Shoot the cannon.
[10987.66s -> 10988.30s]  Hits the present.
[10989.35s -> 10989.91s]  Present.
[10989.91s -> 10991.27s]  Onto the backboard.
[10992.62s -> 10993.18s]  Backboard.
[10994.58s -> 10995.22s]  Goes over here.
[10997.50s -> 10998.00s]  Dump it.
[11006.14s -> 11012.58s]  Yeah, we finally did it at the time.
[11013.94s -> 11014.44s]  Oh.
[11033.38s -> 11033.88s]  Okay.
[11033.88s -> 11034.38s]  Wow.
[11037.14s -> 11037.94s]  Everybody.
[11037.94s -> 11039.30s]  It's almost dawn.
[11039.30s -> 11040.74s]  What are you standing around for?
[11042.26s -> 11048.18s]  We don't get to pull together and save Christmas for the kids of the world.
[11048.18s -> 11051.94s]  When have I ever done like a change the letters around joke to make another word?
[11051.94s -> 11052.66s]  That's never happened.
[11052.66s -> 11054.18s]  I can do the urinating.
[11054.18s -> 11055.30s]  It's opinion, not a fact.
[11055.30s -> 11057.78s]  And who could possibly deliver all the toys in time?
[11058.98s -> 11066.74s]  Read seven.
[11066.74s -> 11068.58s]  Merry Christmas.
[11068.58s -> 11069.08s]  Good luck.
[11069.08s -> 11069.86s]  Drink water.
[11069.86s -> 11073.29s]  So that was the Christmas episode.
[11075.22s -> 11078.18s]  Say Max, do you think we should have waited for them to load the presents
[11078.18s -> 11079.46s]  before we drove off?
[11079.46s -> 11080.82s]  What's the rush, Sam?
[11080.82s -> 11082.18s]  It's the middle of November.
[11084.34s -> 11091.32s]  Oh.
[11091.32s -> 11092.76s]  Ice Station Santa.
[11105.48s -> 11105.98s]  Cool.
[11106.36s -> 11107.16s]  That was fun.
[11107.80s -> 11113.35s]  We're gonna take a pee break while the ending plays out
[11113.35s -> 11114.63s]  and then we're gonna go on to episode two.
[11116.60s -> 11117.72s]  Next episode when?
[11117.72s -> 11118.22s]  Right now.
[11118.76s -> 11120.22s]  You're about to see it.
[11120.22s -> 11127.62s]  All right.
[11127.62s -> 11128.42s]  I'll be right back.
[11129.14s -> 11131.42s]  This will just play out.
[11132.06s -> 11134.07s]  We'll see you in like two, three minutes.
[11134.63s -> 11323.75s]  Why is it taking so long to pee?
[11323.83s -> 11325.43s]  But I gotta get water, too.
[11325.43s -> 11328.46s]  Come on.
[11328.46s -> 11329.10s]  I gotta pee.
[11329.10s -> 11329.90s]  I gotta get water.
[11329.90s -> 11332.14s]  I gotta like stand up and shake around and move around a little.
[11337.56s -> 11339.53s]  Takes a few minutes.
[11339.53s -> 11340.65s]  Everyone always screams.
[11341.29s -> 11342.73s]  You're not hydrated enough.
[11342.73s -> 11343.53s]  You're gonna die.
[11344.09s -> 11345.26s]  Where the fuck is he?
[11345.26s -> 11346.14s]  Get back here now.
[11347.21s -> 11348.25s]  I was gonna get a water.
[11348.25s -> 11348.57s]  No.
[11348.57s -> 11349.07s]  No.
[11349.61s -> 11350.11s]  Now.
[11350.95s -> 11351.45s]  Okay.
[11352.92s -> 11354.84s]  But drink some water.
[11354.84s -> 11355.64s]  For God's sakes.
[11355.64s -> 11361.94s]  You're shriveling up.
[11361.94s -> 11362.44s]  Sorry.
[11364.02s -> 11364.52s]  All right.
[11365.27s -> 11366.47s]  Let's do episode two.
[11375.03s -> 11376.39s]  You guys are like a grandma.
[11378.30s -> 11379.34s]  Dear, dear.
[11379.34s -> 11380.30s]  Please come in.
[11380.30s -> 11380.80s]  Yes.
[11381.58s -> 11382.38s]  You have no idea.
[11382.38s -> 11383.10s]  Look at you.
[11383.10s -> 11384.54s]  You haven't eaten in forever.
[11384.54s -> 11385.02s]  Get in here.
[11385.02s -> 11386.14s]  Let me get you some cookies.
[11387.51s -> 11387.99s]  Oh, yes.
[11387.99s -> 11389.19s]  You love cookies.
[11389.19s -> 11390.39s]  No, have a steak, too.
[11390.39s -> 11392.31s]  Let grandma will take care of you.
[11392.31s -> 11394.09s]  You know, you look a little fat today.
[11394.73s -> 11398.41s]  Hey, I think you need to go outside more often and get some exercise.
[11411.83s -> 11415.03s]  There's the Adam Sandler voice again.
[11415.75s -> 11416.47s]  That's the guy.
[11416.47s -> 11418.07s]  That's probably an Adam Sandler joke.
[11418.89s -> 11420.17s]  I definitely didn't make that up.
[11420.17s -> 11421.80s]  Somebody else did.
[11421.80s -> 11423.40s]  That's been a thing for a long time.
[11423.96s -> 11425.56s]  Adam Sandler probably made that up, too.
[11435.45s -> 11438.14s]  Adam Sandler was funny, you know,
[11438.14s -> 11441.18s]  before he started doing a Netflix movie every three months.
[11442.63s -> 11445.59s]  He was funny like 10, 20 years ago.
[11445.59s -> 11454.66s]  What do you mean he wasn't funny ever?
[11454.66s -> 11456.10s]  He was funny on Saturday Night Live.
[11459.40s -> 11461.64s]  Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison.
[11461.64s -> 11466.95s]  Those movies were actually pretty funny.
[11466.95s -> 11468.95s]  Just because his movies are not good now.
[11476.87s -> 11489.02s]  Like his like mid to late 90s movies were pretty good.
[11489.02s -> 11492.70s]  That was like the heyday I said that Chris Farley, Adam Sandler,
[11493.43s -> 11498.87s]  Dana Carvey, David Spade, Chris Rock.
[11498.87s -> 11501.43s]  Come on.
[11501.43s -> 11504.04s]  That was like the golden years.
[11507.61s -> 11509.45s]  All not particularly funny people.
[11509.45s -> 11510.25s]  Holy shit.
[11510.97s -> 11516.84s]  I'm too old for this.
[11519.18s -> 11520.38s]  Who's funny now?
[11520.38s -> 11525.10s]  Who would you compare to Chris Rock that's funnier now?
[11527.64s -> 11529.88s]  Somebody just, Ninja.
[11543.35s -> 11544.47s]  Bill Burr is hilarious,
[11544.47s -> 11554.57s]  but Bill Burr has also been around for a long time.
[11554.57s -> 11555.37s]  All right.
[11555.37s -> 11577.58s]  Okay, before I have a meltdown, anyone you don't like.
[11581.69s -> 11582.25s]  All right, let me.
[11583.05s -> 11583.69s]  Okay, here we go.
[11585.59s -> 11587.69s]  Quit this episode two.
[11588.57s -> 11589.05s]  Give me a moment.
[11589.05s -> 11592.79s]  It's actually kind of opening these old games.
[11592.79s -> 11595.35s]  They require a lot of care and attention.
[11595.99s -> 11598.47s]  So I'm going to mute the audio so I don't hurt anybody.
[11602.97s -> 11606.09s]  I have to change the title too, to make it episode two.
[11606.65s -> 11610.36s]  Which is uh, Moi Better Blues.
[11610.92s -> 11612.20s]  Here we go.
[11612.28s -> 11615.08s]  I have to do all the settings again.
[11622.98s -> 11623.46s]  Why is it not?
[11623.46s -> 11626.70s]  There we go.
[11626.70s -> 11627.90s]  Do I drink tap water?
[11630.38s -> 11631.18s]  Technically, yes.
[11633.96s -> 11635.88s]  I mean, it comes out of the tap.
[11635.88s -> 11638.12s]  I don't drink it right from the tap though.
[11638.12s -> 11638.76s]  It's filtered.
[11643.29s -> 11643.69s]  Hold on.
[11643.69s -> 11644.01s]  I'm sorry.
[11644.01s -> 11644.25s]  Sorry.
[11644.25s -> 11645.21s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[11645.21s -> 11652.82s]  Pause.
[11652.82s -> 11654.74s]  No, I have a water filter.
[11654.74s -> 11656.74s]  So the tap water goes through the water filter,
[11656.74s -> 11657.86s]  and then I drank it.
[11657.86s -> 11659.78s]  It's a good filter.
[11659.78s -> 11660.10s]  Don't worry.
[11662.41s -> 11664.01s]  Let's get this on here.
[11672.62s -> 11673.18s]  There we go.
[11673.82s -> 11678.06s]  The audio seems to be okay though.
[11678.62s -> 11680.71s]  I hope it is.
[11684.26s -> 11686.02s]  That's such an American thing to do,
[11686.02s -> 11687.30s]  to filter your water.
[11688.02s -> 11691.13s]  There's a lot of fucked up shit that is in water.
[11695.91s -> 11697.83s]  How is it American to filter your water?
[11701.53s -> 11703.29s]  EU stream was yesterday.
[11703.29s -> 11704.49s]  You may have missed it.
[11704.49s -> 11709.50s]  Let me make sure that's all set.
[11710.06s -> 11711.96s]  Now I'm going to change the title.
[11711.96s -> 11715.03s]  Episode two.
[11715.03s -> 11716.23s]  Oh, two.
[11716.87s -> 11717.80s]  There it is.
[11717.80s -> 11718.52s]  Let me update it.
[11720.20s -> 11720.44s]  All right.
[11720.44s -> 11722.52s]  We're officially ready to play episode two.
[11728.97s -> 11731.29s]  Good time coming back from the North Pole, Amax.
[11731.29s -> 11733.21s]  If you say so, Miss Daisy.
[11733.21s -> 11734.17s]  If I'd been driving,
[11734.17s -> 11736.41s]  it wouldn't have taken us a whole month to get home.
[11736.41s -> 11738.41s]  Well, I've got to go drain the DeSoto.
[11738.41s -> 11740.89s]  You should have taken care of that before we left.
[11740.89s -> 11742.81s]  Somebody insisted that we drive through
[11742.81s -> 11744.33s]  the Hudson Bay with the top down.
[11749.98s -> 11753.21s]  What the hell was that all about?
[11753.21s -> 11754.25s]  That's what I said.
[11754.25s -> 11756.09s]  Unless I miss my guess,
[11756.09s -> 11758.73s]  Sybil's being pursued by some kind of rogue,
[11758.73s -> 11760.81s]  semi-sentient, interdimensional portal.
[11762.49s -> 11768.63s]  Think we should try to help her?
[11768.63s -> 11769.99s]  Can't think of anything better to do.
[11771.19s -> 11774.49s]  All right.
[11774.49s -> 11775.29s]  So at its peak,
[11776.52s -> 11780.76s]  how much was the Max's head in United States dollars?
[11788.34s -> 11790.02s]  No matter how many fires we cause,
[11790.02s -> 11792.02s]  this baby keeps 70 to 80 bucks.
[11792.02s -> 11792.34s]  Yeah.
[11792.34s -> 11794.18s]  And without complaining about it,
[11794.18s -> 11796.42s]  not like all those uppity firefighters.
[11797.38s -> 11801.59s]  Is it still worth some money, isn't it?
[11803.11s -> 11804.31s]  Have to do anything with the robot?
[11804.31s -> 11805.27s]  Well, well.
[11805.27s -> 11807.59s]  We were wondering where you'd scampered off to.
[11807.59s -> 11809.43s]  What are you doing just standing there?
[11809.51s -> 11810.63s]  Stop that thing.
[11810.63s -> 11811.27s]  What do you want me to do?
[11811.27s -> 11813.59s]  You already sucked up Big Otis and T-Bone.
[11816.20s -> 11817.80s]  It's some kind of semi-sentient,
[11817.80s -> 11819.00s]  interdimensional portal.
[11819.00s -> 11819.32s]  Okay.
[11820.82s -> 11821.78s]  Don't have to shoot it.
[11822.58s -> 11825.99s]  When it comes back around,
[11825.99s -> 11826.63s]  I'm just gonna shoot it.
[11827.19s -> 11834.34s]  Well, I would have stopped it,
[11834.34s -> 11834.74s]  wouldn't it?
[11838.06s -> 11839.26s]  Throw a parking meter.
[11841.88s -> 11842.68s]  Make it the water.
[11842.68s -> 11843.56s]  Have water shoot out.
[11844.28s -> 11847.30s]  It's some kind of...
[11847.94s -> 11848.34s]  Okay.
[11848.34s -> 11849.30s]  What about Bosco's?
[11858.84s -> 11859.64s]  Hey, Bosco.
[11859.64s -> 11861.24s]  What do you know about suddenly appearing
[11861.24s -> 11862.84s]  interdimensional portals?
[11862.84s -> 11864.20s]  I hear a lot of things.
[11864.20s -> 11865.32s]  What does it look like?
[11865.32s -> 11868.12s]  Three sides, reddish, chasing Sybil.
[11868.12s -> 11871.24s]  Oh, what you've got there is a Bermuda Triangle.
[11871.24s -> 11872.60s]  Bermuda Triangle.
[11872.60s -> 11874.20s]  Why didn't we think of that?
[11874.20s -> 11875.80s]  Wait, chasing Sybil?
[11875.80s -> 11877.16s]  You mean it's here?
[11877.16s -> 11878.52s]  Oh, that ain't good.
[11878.52s -> 11879.56s]  That ain't good at all.
[11881.00s -> 11884.04s]  Uh, shouldn't the Bermuda Triangle be in Bermuda?
[11884.84s -> 11887.56s]  What's the Bermuda Triangle doing all the way up here?
[11887.56s -> 11889.80s]  Sometimes they just like to wander.
[11889.80s -> 11893.80s]  Unless it was summoned by T-H-E-M.
[11894.76s -> 11895.88s]  This thing again.
[11895.88s -> 11896.20s]  Okay.
[11897.64s -> 11898.84s]  Who controls the Triangle?
[11898.84s -> 11899.88s]  Who's controlling the Triangle here?
[11899.88s -> 11901.16s]  I told you.
[11901.16s -> 11903.16s]  T-H-E-M.
[11903.16s -> 11906.12s]  I really hope you're talking about the giant ants this time.
[11906.12s -> 11907.48s]  Giant ants?
[11907.48s -> 11908.76s]  That's crazy.
[11908.76s -> 11912.04s]  I'm talking about the mysterious cabal of controllers
[11912.04s -> 11915.40s]  who summon the Triangle's Ascension portals
[11915.40s -> 11917.08s]  to do their dark bidding.
[11917.08s -> 11918.52s]  Well, that makes sense.
[11918.52s -> 11921.00s]  If there's a Triangle in our neighborhood,
[11921.00s -> 11922.92s]  that means they're coming.
[11923.88s -> 11924.28s]  All right.
[11925.64s -> 11928.12s]  Oh, how do we stop this Triangle?
[11928.12s -> 11930.44s]  Once a Triangle gets imprinted on you,
[11930.44s -> 11931.88s]  it's tough to shake it.
[11931.88s -> 11933.88s]  But they say you can train them
[11933.88s -> 11936.52s]  if you can figure out how to communicate with them.
[11936.52s -> 11937.02s]  Okay.
[11938.04s -> 11940.58s]  How do we communicate with the Triangle?
[11940.58s -> 11943.70s]  They're very attracted to Symbols and Sigils.
[11943.70s -> 11945.54s]  Symbols and Sigils.
[11945.54s -> 11946.66s]  Those two.
[11946.66s -> 11948.18s]  They're not real picky.
[11948.18s -> 11950.50s]  They're driven by shapes and colors.
[11950.50s -> 11953.54s]  A pink rhombus makes it nostalgic for the people.
[11953.54s -> 11954.66s]  Pink rhombus.
[11954.66s -> 11955.38s]  Red octagon.
[11955.38s -> 11956.42s]  Makes it stop whatever it's doing.
[11956.42s -> 11957.06s]  I need a red octagon.
[11957.06s -> 11960.74s]  A blue icosahedron makes it sit in its mom's basement
[11960.74s -> 11962.66s]  and draw maps of dungeons.
[11962.66s -> 11964.34s]  And they can't see or hear.
[11964.34s -> 11967.70s]  So you've got to feed them a symbol of what you want them to do.
[11967.70s -> 11969.14s]  Okay, so we need an octagon.
[11970.90s -> 11973.80s]  We'd like to buy something.
[11973.80s -> 11975.56s]  I told you, fools, last time.
[11975.56s -> 11977.24s]  The store is closed.
[11977.24s -> 11980.84s]  But I've been craving a pack of beef tarts for weeks now.
[11980.84s -> 11983.80s]  It's the delicious tangy candy that makes its own gravy.
[11983.80s -> 11984.84s]  Help us out, Bosko.
[11984.84s -> 11985.48s]  That sounds pretty good.
[11985.48s -> 11986.76s]  Stop wasting my time.
[11986.76s -> 11988.76s]  I'll never get the bunker ready if you two keep chatting.
[11988.76s -> 11990.52s]  Some of these comedy foods I would love to eat.
[12000.74s -> 12002.58s]  You can't close the store, Bosko.
[12002.58s -> 12005.70s]  Everything we value is bought or shoplifted from here.
[12005.70s -> 12006.74s]  Don't you see?
[12006.74s -> 12008.50s]  The end is nigh!
[12008.50s -> 12009.46s]  Nigh?
[12009.46s -> 12010.82s]  Yes, nigh!
[12010.82s -> 12012.90s]  Wandering Bermuda Triangles.
[12012.90s -> 12015.22s]  Strange radio transmission.
[12015.30s -> 12016.50s]  Don't you see?
[12016.50s -> 12018.58s]  It's T-H-E-M!
[12018.58s -> 12019.70s]  They're coming!
[12019.70s -> 12022.42s]  I have to relocate before it's too late!
[12022.42s -> 12025.06s]  When your life is such a joke that you want to eat comedy food.
[12029.32s -> 12031.64s]  But like you didn't, like you've never wanted to have
[12032.36s -> 12033.72s]  like a donut from The Simpsons?
[12035.46s -> 12037.14s]  Like specifically from The Simpsons?
[12043.14s -> 12043.86s]  Come on.
[12043.86s -> 12044.66s]  Donuts are real.
[12044.66s -> 12045.70s]  That's a real food, though.
[12049.16s -> 12050.20s]  Oh, yeah.
[12050.20s -> 12058.41s]  Um, what about a, uh, everlasting gobstopper?
[12058.97s -> 12063.10s]  Those aren't real.
[12063.10s -> 12065.26s]  That's a fucking comedy food.
[12065.82s -> 12069.58s]  Those are real.
[12069.58s -> 12070.54s]  No, they're not.
[12070.54s -> 12073.34s]  Those aren't real.
[12073.98s -> 12076.86s]  Wonka was bought out by one company and they, uh, they do, they still,
[12076.86s -> 12077.90s]  only thing they do is nerds.
[12078.54s -> 12082.63s]  They don't do anything else anymore.
[12082.63s -> 12083.91s]  They don't have like Wonka bars anymore.
[12083.91s -> 12088.90s]  They don't, the Wonka the company went under.
[12088.90s -> 12090.10s]  They don't really exist anymore.
[12090.66s -> 12092.73s]  Look it up.
[12093.37s -> 12097.45s]  Why does the Bermuda Triangle have such a grudge against all those boats and planes?
[12097.45s -> 12099.93s]  Oh, the Triangle got a bad rap for that.
[12099.93s -> 12105.85s]  Scientists say those accidents were caused by sudden explosive outbursts of methane gas.
[12106.49s -> 12107.61s]  Speaking of which.
[12108.33s -> 12109.45s]  Max, don't.
[12109.45s -> 12110.33s]  What, Sam?
[12110.33s -> 12114.17s]  I was going to point out that many phenomena long believed to have paranormal causes
[12114.17s -> 12117.21s]  have actually turned out to be far more mundane in origin.
[12117.21s -> 12121.37s]  Only one phenomenon's tremendous power continues to baffle scientists.
[12121.37s -> 12123.69s]  Why do you always bring negative energy?
[12124.49s -> 12125.05s]  What's that?
[12126.33s -> 12139.40s]  All right, so let's, we need to get out here.
[12139.40s -> 12142.70s]  I'm gonna get a red, I'm gonna get octagon.
[12143.42s -> 12146.22s]  I wasn't laughing at that.
[12146.22s -> 12148.06s]  I was laughing at something, the thing that somebody said.
[12148.70s -> 12177.05s]  All right, we need, what do you, let's go to order.
[12179.35s -> 12180.31s]  Into Stanky's.
[12180.31s -> 12181.19s]  What about the toys?
[12188.70s -> 12189.50s]  Howdy, cops.
[12189.50s -> 12190.86s]  How's the auto body business?
[12190.86s -> 12193.42s]  How does it feel knowing you're the only person on Twitch streaming this game?
[12196.36s -> 12197.16s]  Doesn't surprise me.
[12206.33s -> 12207.61s]  All right, so we have to stop this.
[12207.61s -> 12208.81s]  We need an octagon.
[12209.93s -> 12210.89s]  Can we go into symbols?
[12214.55s -> 12215.67s]  Sibyl's office is closed.
[12215.67s -> 12217.51s]  What does she do now, anyway?
[12217.51s -> 12220.71s]  I don't know, but whatever it is, she's doing even less of it than usual.
[12220.71s -> 12224.55s]  Number one Sam and Max scream, screamer, streamer.
[12225.91s -> 12230.70s]  Oh, damn it, stupid spot.
[12230.70s -> 12231.02s]  Red.
[12231.02s -> 12231.98s]  Hi, you stinky.
[12231.98s -> 12233.90s]  Oh, it's you guys.
[12233.90s -> 12235.02s]  Hank and Jethro, was it?
[12235.02s -> 12235.42s]  Red, toaster.
[12235.42s -> 12236.78s]  Sam and Max, actually.
[12236.78s -> 12237.98s]  What are you doing?
[12237.98s -> 12239.82s]  What? I was just taking care of some cleaning.
[12239.82s -> 12241.02s]  Red, stoplight.
[12241.82s -> 12245.42s]  If that's a blood stain, you should be sure to use bleach.
[12246.38s -> 12248.30s]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[12256.41s -> 12260.09s]  Sadly, I think my days of pillaging coastal villages are now behind me.
[12267.91s -> 12268.79s]  Give me, give me.
[12268.79s -> 12270.31s]  Can we borrow your sign, stinky?
[12270.31s -> 12271.75s]  It's kind of important.
[12271.75s -> 12272.87s]  Well, okay.
[12272.87s -> 12273.75s]  But bring it back.
[12273.75s -> 12275.03s]  It's a national heirloom.
[12275.03s -> 12275.99s]  You made an octagon.
[12275.99s -> 12278.55s]  That will stop sign that would have prevented the Kennedy assassination
[12278.55s -> 12279.99s]  if Connolly hadn't run it.
[12280.87s -> 12281.59s]  He's blind.
[12282.31s -> 12282.55s]  What?
[12284.30s -> 12286.06s]  Yeah, they can't do everything instantly.
[12286.78s -> 12288.04s]  Oh my god.
[12288.36s -> 12290.63s]  Instantly.
[12290.63s -> 12293.59s]  I need to instantly do it in a second.
[12296.97s -> 12297.53s]  Look, Max.
[12297.53s -> 12299.29s]  It's our neighbor, Flint Paper.
[12299.29s -> 12300.33s]  Hiya, fellas.
[12300.33s -> 12302.33s]  Keep it on the down low, would ya?
[12302.33s -> 12304.25s]  I'm doing surveillance.
[12304.25s -> 12306.65s]  Oh boy, real detective work.
[12306.65s -> 12308.17s]  Who are you spying on?
[12308.17s -> 12310.25s]  Some bug, the name of Bosco.
[12311.13s -> 12315.37s]  Oh, so, wait, is this a, somebody's, okay.
[12315.37s -> 12318.41s]  Stinky's has no smoking unless you're Flint policy.
[12318.41s -> 12320.65s]  Sounds a lot like their policy on homicides.
[12322.17s -> 12325.77s]  Kitty litter, somebody gave a lot of money.
[12327.26s -> 12328.78s]  The Bala Koala, 50 bucks.
[12328.78s -> 12332.30s]  Thank you for the 50 dollars, 5,000 bits, 5,000 bits.
[12332.30s -> 12332.70s]  Thank you.
[12334.25s -> 12340.10s]  Bala Koala, huge cast drop, bit explosion there.
[12340.10s -> 12342.74s]  And they say, don't listen to chat.
[12342.74s -> 12343.30s]  They suck.
[12349.69s -> 12350.89s]  Thank you for the 50 dollars.
[12350.89s -> 12354.54s]  I mean, that's, that's the opinion.
[12354.54s -> 12356.86s]  No problem, the jukebox only takes 20s.
[12358.63s -> 12359.67s]  That's your opinion.
[12360.31s -> 12368.46s]  But I like him here for a second.
[12368.46s -> 12369.82s]  Yeah, yeah, no, come here.
[12369.82s -> 12373.32s]  Yep, nailed it, man.
[12373.32s -> 12376.39s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, they can't hear us.
[12376.39s -> 12377.99s]  No, that was fucking the livers.
[12377.99s -> 12379.19s]  Of course that's what I fucking think.
[12379.99s -> 12381.03s]  Get the fuck right in there, man.
[12381.03s -> 12381.99s]  Fucking thank you for that.
[12382.79s -> 12384.90s]  All right, thanks for coming out.
[12384.90s -> 12385.40s]  See you later.
[12388.04s -> 12399.72s]  Hey, there we go.
[12399.72s -> 12402.47s]  Now thanks for the 50 bucks.
[12403.11s -> 12406.07s]  Just wanted to, I wanted to just say thanks in person.
[12406.07s -> 12408.39s]  A little, you know, bring them up and just puddle up a little bit and just,
[12409.85s -> 12412.73s]  you know, like what dad does at the wedding when he leans in and just,
[12412.73s -> 12414.33s]  I just wanted to tell him a couple things.
[12414.33s -> 12415.05s]  Appreciate that.
[12418.70s -> 12420.54s]  All right, so we have, let's go stop it.
[12435.90s -> 12437.26s]  What are you talking about?
[12437.26s -> 12443.13s]  I just had a moment with somebody.
[12443.13s -> 12450.78s]  Come on, cross over here so I can stop you.
[12465.19s -> 12466.98s]  Got it.
[12466.98s -> 12467.48s]  Doink.
[12478.01s -> 12479.21s]  Don't suck up Abe Lincoln's head.
[12482.39s -> 12482.89s]  No!
[12483.43s -> 12487.29s]  Oh, not Abe Lincoln.
[12487.29s -> 12487.79s]  No!
[12497.70s -> 12498.90s]  Casualties.
[12498.90s -> 12501.22s]  What do you think's on the other side, Sam?
[12501.22s -> 12502.26s]  Oh, I don't know.
[12502.26s -> 12505.62s]  Probably some horrible alternate dimension ruled by incomprehensibly
[12505.62s -> 12508.66s]  horrific ancient gods seeking to bring chaos to this plane.
[12508.66s -> 12509.94s]  Do you want to jump in?
[12509.94s -> 12511.14s]  You can read my mind, Sam.
[12511.14s -> 12512.42s]  Oh, we're going a new dimension.
[12512.42s -> 12513.06s]  I hope not.
[12514.58s -> 12522.41s]  It's my opportunity.
[12522.41s -> 12522.89s]  I can do it.
[12537.40s -> 12560.49s]  They're more difficult than I imagined a horrific alternate dimension to be.
[12560.49s -> 12560.89s]  Help.
[12561.53s -> 12562.49s]  Help me.
[12563.53s -> 12564.55s]  Help!
[12564.55s -> 12566.31s]  Oh, you big baby.
[12566.95s -> 12570.79s]  But my nose sunburns so easily.
[12570.79s -> 12571.91s]  I'll get it for you later.
[12572.95s -> 12575.03s]  Oh, hi, StamaMax.
[12575.03s -> 12576.71s]  Are you guys on vacation too?
[12576.71s -> 12577.67s]  Yeah, we're on vacation.
[12577.75s -> 12581.81s]  We came here to rescue you from unimaginable horrors beyond the portal of mystery
[12581.81s -> 12586.55s]  You could have at least had the courtesy to be impaled on spikes or something step aside
[12588.51s -> 12594.53s]  Well, thanks for the thought guys, but this place is great. What was the name of it again? Hey
[12595.63s -> 12599.63s]  What scab are you guys eating in that pot activity in the South Pacific?
[12600.31s -> 12604.27s]  Commonly known as Easter Island because once you leave three days later
[12604.27s -> 12609.63s]  You can't wait to come back Abe and I thought this would be a great chance to get some alone time
[12610.43s -> 12612.43s]  emphasis on alone
[12613.59s -> 12618.07s]  Finally someone has come to rescue us from the ancient prophecy
[12619.59s -> 12623.93s]  Talk oh Sam ancient prophecies can only mean two things
[12624.71s -> 12630.47s]  Tedious backstories and work we don't get paid for let's hear them out little buddy. Well, all right
[12630.67s -> 12637.23s]  Maybe these giant stone heads have something interesting stone heads. What's all this about a prophecy?
[12637.23s -> 12642.79s]  The ancient ones said this was going to happen. It's the end of our civilization
[12643.59s -> 12648.15s]  But you can stop the prophecy and save us all
[12649.83s -> 12650.99s]  Okay
[12650.99s -> 12655.43s]  What what is the prophecy? What exactly does this prophecy say is going to happen?
[12655.59s -> 12661.17s]  The carvers were told of golden age of one thousand years of peace
[12665.39s -> 12669.03s]  Cataclysm the great volcano god Rana how would
[12669.51s -> 12676.87s]  Reawaken and rain fiery death upon the island our noble civilization would come to an end
[12678.95s -> 12681.05s]  Sounds like we picked the coolest time to come
[12681.53s -> 12686.35s]  What do you want us to do you must stop Ron a cow from the
[12690.38s -> 12697.04s]  Legend speak of a hidden cave beneath the island where the ancient carvers built a means to pacify
[12697.26s -> 12703.18s]  Dribble Venus eyes in the mood for a little spelunking and volcano god pacifying a little buddy
[12703.26s -> 12710.40s]  If by pacifying you mean squeezing the magma out of him like toothpaste from a savagely beaten tube and by spelunking you mean
[12710.92s -> 12712.92s]  Spelunking and yes
[12713.68s -> 12720.34s]  Okay, we'll do it. We'll take the case your honor. What does that mean like the Hawaiian word aloha?
[12720.34s -> 12725.78s]  It can mean many things like hello. Goodbye or as in this case
[12726.18s -> 12728.62s]  We're not going to pay you
[12729.66s -> 12731.66s]  Really is the universal language
[12732.30s -> 12734.30s]  Not even a couple of bits
[12735.14s -> 12740.10s]  Anything else in that prophecy who are you guys? Who are you guys? Anyway, we are the moai
[12741.06s -> 12745.56s]  Guardians of the island spirit keepers of the elemental power
[12746.42s -> 12750.26s]  Sounds like either a good prog rock album or a bad animated series. I
[12751.26s -> 12753.26s]  control the power of wind
[12755.30s -> 12760.42s]  Well, I used to control the wind now there's not much point to it
[12761.90s -> 12763.68s]  Okay
[12763.68s -> 12769.70s]  So where's the cave? Where is this ancient hidden underground cave? It's hidden. Cool it rocky
[12769.70s -> 12771.70s]  We were asking the middle one
[12772.14s -> 12777.82s]  Unfortunately, he is correct. The entrance to the cave is shrouded in mystery. It's gonna be in one of their mouths
[12778.82s -> 12780.58s]  with peril
[12780.58s -> 12787.06s]  Brought with peril or just right with peril. This is the kind of thing we need to know going in it doesn't matter
[12787.06s -> 12789.06s]  You'll never find it
[12789.22s -> 12793.67s]  Okay, cheer up max and I will find a way to stop that volcano
[12793.67s -> 12800.59s]  Oh good, then we'll be able to go back to our important work of sitting motionless and staring
[12801.67s -> 12807.11s]  We have something to look forward to that's a really really good Queen of thorns
[12809.27s -> 12813.60s]  Impression I feel like the Queen of thought feel like that was watching game from
[12814.44s -> 12824.04s]  portal triangle triangle
[12824.08s -> 12831.66s]  Gone and lost and found they don't even know that
[12832.50s -> 12835.70s]  That's not a joke. I just think that that sounds just like all this junk
[12836.02s -> 12841.26s]  I'm gonna ring the triangle anything good want to read the second half of the 20 commandments
[12841.26s -> 12845.02s]  Nah, I only support omnipotent deities when I'm the deity
[12845.90s -> 12855.23s]  Okay
[12855.23s -> 12857.03s]  fountain of youth
[12857.03s -> 12861.33s]  Gong light preserver the only thing that survived from the SS minnow
[12861.53s -> 12865.75s]  Did they ever find all those irritating castaways? Nobody ever looked
[12866.65s -> 12871.96s]  It's the fountain of youth
[12875.30s -> 12878.85s]  All right, so there was a deadly piranha swimming in it
[12879.61s -> 12881.61s]  I never wished that about anything
[12882.57s -> 12888.09s]  Get rid of the piranhas somehow triangle pong. What are these?
[12888.93s -> 12896.74s]  Check this out max. It's even the same color scheme this portal
[12897.30s -> 12906.77s]  When did this come out? It's a gong with a silver triangle on it. Check this out max
[12907.49s -> 12909.49s]  All right, so
[12909.53s -> 12922.78s]  This is the portal out anything else in here. There's the picnic. They're doing a picnic over here
[12923.42s -> 12933.03s]  Gong there's like this gongs all over the place. It's a silver gong. Oh, we're salmon max freelance bro. The cake is a lie
[12933.03s -> 12937.38s]  I can do this one
[12940.94s -> 12947.04s]  Still can't understand you speak a little more clearly
[12947.56s -> 12961.60s]  What's left of Noah's Ark? So the legends are true
[12961.88s -> 12967.84s]  Someone really was crazy enough to save mosquitoes from extinction and humans live and learn
[12968.84s -> 12976.53s]  I know where to go. How did you find picnic stuff on a desolate island? Easy. It was on the picnic basket
[12977.29s -> 12985.05s]  So I drank all the coffee out of this coffee mug. It's been sitting here empty with just a little coffee stain on the bottom
[12988.00s -> 12991.52s]  That it's this smells so bad, I don't know why
[12992.44s -> 12996.20s]  When coffee dries out, that's why I never spill coffee in your fucking car
[12996.92s -> 13002.07s]  When coffee dries it smells it like shit
[13002.67s -> 13004.55s]  like actual shit
[13004.55s -> 13009.41s]  I've ever one time my mother dumped a whole coffee in the car accidentally
[13010.17s -> 13013.05s]  And it smelled like my little ass
[13013.89s -> 13020.53s]  Five years, but something tells me this just might be the ancient entrance to the secret underground lair of the volcano god
[13020.53s -> 13022.53s]  Where do you think you're going?
[13027.93s -> 13032.81s]  Try not to get imprinted or shot max we still don't know who this little type belongs to
[13033.05s -> 13035.05s]  Jimmy Hoffa belongs to nobody
[13038.41s -> 13040.58s]  Okay, so
[13040.58s -> 13046.99s]  You can't be Jimmy Hoffa Jimmy Hoffa was a ruthless union organizer and head of the teamsters in the 50s and 60s
[13047.47s -> 13052.39s]  Known for his ties to organized crime and his mysterious disappearance good recap Sam
[13052.75s -> 13057.19s]  Also, Jimmy Hoffa wasn't a diaper wearing baby. I'm not a baby
[13057.19s -> 13059.19s]  No
[13062.87s -> 13070.15s]  People always showing me disrespect you should never have started drinking from that fountain of youth. No, it makes sense
[13071.15s -> 13076.02s]  What fountain of youth are you talking about? We're gonna be babies fountain right there brainiac
[13077.14s -> 13080.86s]  You expect us to believe the fountain of youth is on Easter Island
[13080.86s -> 13084.18s]  I can't believe it. I can't believe how perfect he is
[13085.82s -> 13093.50s]  Okay, you came here for the mountain water a little hard haven't you I do but take on occasion. Yes. That's my business
[13102.66s -> 13108.66s]  Well, why'd you drink so much of infancy look I ain't got no problem, so don't go saying that I do
[13109.14s -> 13111.94s]  It's just a little discretion is required
[13112.46s -> 13118.06s]  Drink too little you have to go through puberty again too much and bada bing
[13119.46s -> 13120.94s]  but as
[13120.94s -> 13125.92s]  Just take a small sip every day and stay the same age, you know
[13125.92s -> 13132.28s]  Well, just take put an eye droplet in there and like drop one droplet into your eye and you'll stay like 40 forever
[13132.28s -> 13138.94s]  I don't see where the big deal is
[13139.30s -> 13144.14s]  Step aside sport we grown-ups have to take care of a great big mean old volcano gone
[13144.30s -> 13148.44s]  You and your companion will be one thing to take a step back
[13154.22s -> 13160.46s]  Not now max then when Sam my biological clock is ticking and I'm not getting any younger
[13161.14s -> 13167.43s]  If you spit into the fountain, do you get older?
[13167.99s -> 13176.18s]  Know your spit would the whatever the DNA that's in the saliva would would transmute whatever it does
[13176.70s -> 13179.77s]  No, it would have to come in contact with you
[13180.41s -> 13183.67s]  Okay, so we need to obviously
[13184.51s -> 13191.03s]  His baby getting fussy. Is it his bedtime? I'm gonna speak. Yeah, that's it gets younger
[13195.03s -> 13204.25s]  How can we find out it's baby gassy this baby need to be birthed that's weird to hear that
[13205.53s -> 13207.53s]  It's baby gassy
[13207.85s -> 13211.90s]  That's the first time we've heard. I think him change the way that he speaks
[13212.58s -> 13214.49s]  This is very weird
[13214.49s -> 13222.35s]  We'll give you a nice big rattle for that dumb old gun of yours. You two are seriously trying my patients
[13227.55s -> 13232.93s]  We're going bye-bye now, bye-bye you'll stay gone if you know what's good for you
[13236.67s -> 13238.67s]  To get him to get out of the way
[13239.35s -> 13245.82s]  We can't go in bye. Bye. So we need to okay. Tiny Tiki is this way
[13246.86s -> 13255.68s]  Looks like we've stumbled into some primitive Tiki bar. How it's going
[13258.52s -> 13263.66s]  Pipe down chucklehead. No, I was hoping to get into a lagomorphs gone wild video
[13263.88s -> 13266.24s]  Howdy boys haven't seen you around before
[13266.88s -> 13271.84s]  Sam they're all babies stay calm max. They're more frightened of you than you are of them
[13273.24s -> 13276.02s]  All right, so this is called wipeout
[13276.98s -> 13280.58s]  Hey max, want to see how I won all those surfing trophies back in school
[13280.58s -> 13285.02s]  No, I don't want to see you cry to the PE teacher and then beg me to club your competitors in the knees
[13285.02s -> 13289.94s]  Why? Oh, you're just jealous of my more plausible center of gravity. Watch this
[13291.30s -> 13296.74s]  It's surfing time as the surfboard bucks back and forth use your mouse for the arrow keys to dodge flying bottles
[13298.74s -> 13300.74s]  He's like up or down
[13300.82s -> 13310.57s]  Two surfers don't lose pal. We just bide our time on the next way
[13310.57s -> 13316.65s]  I thought I'd press left all their arms and shriek like startled raccoons either. I'm pretty sure you lost
[13318.17s -> 13323.86s]  Try to have your socks knocked off little pal. I don't wear socks and socks feet humor me socks
[13323.86s -> 13326.02s]  You'll better pretending that you're not naked. Okay
[13336.26s -> 13344.26s]  Hold on. It's not it's not instant. The Sun was in my eyes. I'm gonna take another crack
[13347.67s -> 13354.76s]  The call
[13362.56s -> 13364.16s]  Why is it doing that
[13364.16s -> 13374.49s]  So, what do I get a baby bottle? Well, that was entirely point baby bottle pop a baby bottle pop. I
[13375.01s -> 13378.27s]  Hope so. So it was pointless
[13378.91s -> 13388.74s]  Purely decorative. Hey fellas, what brings you to our little slice of paradise?
[13389.26s -> 13396.98s]  Salmon max freelance police man, and we're here to stop a volcano you babies are in danger. Shut up. We're not babies
[13399.02s -> 13402.26s]  He's right pleased to meet you boys babies
[13405.22s -> 13409.74s]  My name's Amelia a hot you've already met. Mr. Charles Lindbergh, Jr
[13409.94s -> 13414.46s]  Whatever and that other fella is one. Mr. Dan Cooper. Hey
[13415.46s -> 13417.46s]  Call me DB everybody does
[13419.14s -> 13426.39s]  You've been missing forever. You guys have been missing for decades. That's the funny thing about this island
[13426.39s -> 13430.39s]  It's easy to lose track of time. They just keep drinking baby
[13430.39s -> 13436.39s]  You don't write you had conspiracy theorists and documentary filmmakers. Baby fountain youth drink. You can't tell us what to do
[13436.39s -> 13438.39s]  They keep drinking from the fountain of youth
[13438.39s -> 13440.39s]  You look younger than in your pictures
[13440.39s -> 13445.83s]  It's that damn fountain
[13445.83s -> 13447.83s]  Once you start drinking from it, you can't stop
[13447.83s -> 13449.83s]  We had to put the fountain off limits
[13450.07s -> 13455.43s]  From it, you can't stop we had to put the fountain off limits or we would have drunk ourselves out of existence
[13456.43s -> 13462.79s]  Ironic ain't it? I made my reputation being a woman. I'm afraid to wear pants and now I'm wearing rubber pants
[13463.83s -> 13470.70s]  It must have been a big adjustment going back to wearing diapers
[13470.70s -> 13473.18s]  Well, not for me when you're in my line of work
[13473.18s -> 13476.02s]  It helps to have some extra protection if you know what I'm saying
[13476.18s -> 13481.18s]  I ever tell y'all about how I dive them feds and jumped out of a jumbo only like a million times
[13481.54s -> 13486.10s]  Okay, what's the do around here you guys do come on around here
[13486.10s -> 13490.36s]  We used to ride the bucking surfboard until we drank ourselves under the hot limit
[13493.50s -> 13496.42s]  Give me a few more years and I'll beat your record Amelia
[13497.54s -> 13504.46s]  Why don't you just leave why haven't you gone home and ruin a clean getaway? No, they don't understand me at home
[13504.46s -> 13507.26s]  My parents are so stupid
[13507.38s -> 13512.16s]  And I'm not leaving until I get some service
[13513.06s -> 13515.06s]  Who is this one? Who's this guy?
[13515.42s -> 13527.23s]  How'd you manage to all regress to exactly the same age?
[13527.25s -> 13534.65s]  It was a very carefully planned and executed drinking game. You take a drink every time DB says the word parachute
[13535.53s -> 13537.59s]  Okay, see you around kids
[13538.41s -> 13542.99s]  We have to fill up with a drink. I'm gonna get a small max here
[13543.65s -> 13547.68s]  Well
[13547.68s -> 13553.64s]  It's an empty tea kettle tempest not included. Okay. Hold on a minute if we boil the water from
[13554.36s -> 13560.08s]  the Fountain of youth then it maybe will be the fountain of aging. Maybe the boiling the water gets rid of the aging germs and
[13560.88s -> 13565.16s]  It's cartoon logic guys. It's possible. I'm gonna boil the water
[13565.72s -> 13571.95s]  It's a swing town inferno. It's gonna reverse them
[13572.35s -> 13580.42s]  Where did you find so many femurs my old thorn section say hello to Jack Don and
[13580.94s -> 13587.46s]  Rochester that's awesome animals. Tell me about these guys still can't hold the high notes
[13588.46s -> 13593.58s]  steel pins go
[13594.48s -> 13597.20s]  Alas Gene Krupa. I knew him
[13597.96s -> 13602.36s]  Thank you. Thank you
[13602.72s -> 13608.04s]  Hiya boys. You're new here, right?
[13608.48s -> 13615.44s]  Salmon max freelance volcano stoppers. Well gosh, I'm glad to meet you. I'm Glenn Miller
[13616.36s -> 13618.36s]  Maybe you boys can help me out
[13620.53s -> 13622.53s]  Everyone here is missing
[13623.13s -> 13627.53s]  You're a missing person. We thought you were dead. Yeah, I get that a lot
[13627.53s -> 13631.17s]  I was here 20 years before I believed I wasn't really dead
[13632.05s -> 13635.89s]  Hated to break it to you Glenn, but all that hot playing was getting annoying. I
[13636.85s -> 13639.03s]  Don't know who any of these people are I
[13640.09s -> 13644.01s]  Don't I know I I don't know what the references I mean, this is not like
[13644.53s -> 13649.21s]  Chris Rock Adam Sandler David Spade those people were up here. I would know who they were
[13650.01s -> 13660.95s]  What's Benny Goodman like in person Benny could do things with a clarinet that nobody else could
[13661.39s -> 13664.83s]  Thank God a one night after a show in New York
[13665.55s -> 13669.91s]  I'll just tell you it was the damnedest thing I ever saw and and leave it at that
[13670.91s -> 13676.69s]  I know who they are my god. I don't know who they are. I know who two of them are
[13677.31s -> 13686.70s]  But honestly, I got this could be dawn nuts. I don't know from the Andy Griffith show
[13686.70s -> 13696.93s]  I don't know who that is. Was count Basie really a vampire a golem actually
[13696.93s -> 13700.25s]  But we never held that against it. That was we simply time
[13701.05s -> 13708.85s]  How'd you end up here? I was on a mission for the Air Force and I flew here
[13709.01s -> 13713.09s]  You mean your plane was sucked through a portal into an alternate dimension and deposited here
[13713.17s -> 13716.61s]  No, just got kind of lost and crashed on Easter. I
[13717.25s -> 13724.29s]  You ever get a song stuck in your head and can't get it out. It's downright distracting
[13725.25s -> 13728.52s]  All right, so song
[13729.12s -> 13740.27s]  What do you need help with? I'm trying to find just that perfect sound for my next big hit
[13740.63s -> 13741.83s]  Oh
[13741.83s -> 13745.67s]  That's it
[13745.67s -> 13752.63s]  Well, gee, thanks, but I don't want to just put out a repeat of my early stuff. It's got to be new and fresh
[13753.15s -> 13755.51s]  But I'm stuck on on two things
[13755.51s -> 13760.79s]  I need a catchy melody and I need a good train sound a train sound
[13761.87s -> 13764.30s]  You need a melody and a train
[13764.54s -> 13768.74s]  You need a melody and a train whistle for your song cool
[13768.82s -> 13776.66s]  You but I'm pulling out all the stops this song's gonna be about all the things the kids are into these days
[13777.34s -> 13782.62s]  Train the song is gonna be perfect swing dancing in methamphetamines
[13783.38s -> 13785.26s]  But how are we gonna find a new melody?
[13785.26s -> 13789.86s]  You've been here 60 years and have been able to give my show you guys I'm teething

[13829.64s -> 13836.36s]  Any direction that doesn't involve hitting things with hammers is no direction. I want to go. Thank you and good day, sir
[13846.37s -> 13849.06s]  That's it
[13850.02s -> 13861.52s]  Okay, I got the I can hit the gongs so we need a train sound

[13888.43s -> 13892.14s]  Okay
[13893.22s -> 13898.94s]  The ancients use them to transport the sacred stones and to travel all
[13899.34s -> 13903.74s]  Throughout the world and for practical jokes, which weren't funny
[13904.86s -> 13906.54s]  Okay
[13906.54s -> 13909.46s]  If you control the wind, let's see a demonstration

[13915.42s -> 13921.54s]  I guess I've just got a case of the Blas. I don't know
[13921.94s -> 13923.58s]  sacred stones
[13923.58s -> 13928.26s]  God is okay. So I'm gonna make you happy so you blow
[13929.02s -> 13937.64s]  All right, don't do it. Have you heard the good news about rhinoplasty? What are you in flying? Oh
[13938.44s -> 13945.44s]  Nothing. It's good. You're not bound by the conventions of traditional beauty. I'm just the way the Carver's made me
[13946.52s -> 13949.50s]  All right, keep up the good work
[13951.30s -> 13957.86s]  Make them happy, but so did this causes the triangles to appear can more than one appear
[13958.66s -> 13964.39s]  Or can just one appear does it is just one that shows up and teleports over this way
[13965.11s -> 13971.96s]  Okay, so that I guess I can read maybe do it on this one and I can reach into it
[13972.64s -> 13975.46s]  Maybe I could see what's in it
[13977.04s -> 13983.73s]  Check this out max. Where does it go?
[13984.37s -> 13987.32s]  All right, so oh
[13992.37s -> 13994.49s]  That's the book. Hey, that's this one kiss and now
[13997.90s -> 14002.98s]  For some reason I thought they would these were okay. So can I reach in and like grab his head?
[14003.46s -> 14009.25s]  See what happens goldfish memory
[14010.70s -> 14019.66s]  You know, I'm getting up. Let me tell you something. I'm getting real sick and tired of people questioning
[14020.18s -> 14031.61s]  Yeah, no, no, cut it cut the music cut the music. Let me tell you something
[14042.84s -> 14045.68s]  Like the back of the head. Wait, there's a gong over here
[14046.28s -> 14065.00s]  So I okay. Here's where this I don't understand. I can't reach in why why would this matter?
[14073.47s -> 14080.16s]  I'm assuming there's an item that I need to do all these things check this out max
[14080.68s -> 14085.23s]  Like yeah, all I can do is put my hand in there. But if I had something else I could
[14085.77s -> 14087.77s]  Transfer it around but what?
[14088.13s -> 14099.46s]  Well, I could go back to the real world. I think I have exhaust all the options here besides of the picnic
[14099.46s -> 14103.34s]  Let me go over here. Don't you think it's amazing that you found that picnic basket full of food?
[14103.50s -> 14107.18s]  Not really. It was sitting right there. You couldn't miss it
[14108.10s -> 14111.62s]  How's the vacation going? Oh
[14111.62s -> 14115.26s]  The weather's perfect and there's so much history and culture
[14115.54s -> 14122.42s]  The best part is that Abe and I finally get some time all to ourselves. Let's talk there. No distractions
[14124.66s -> 14128.02s]  Abe what? Oh, yeah, right culture
[14129.10s -> 14135.27s]  The volcano is gonna explode volcano is going to erupt in a deadly rain of fiery magma. Aren't you worried?
[14135.27s -> 14139.59s]  Are you sure you're a dog? Did you sound like a big chicken?
[14140.15s -> 14145.79s]  Be nice Abe. Well, if it looks like the volcano is going to blow we'll just hop back through the triangle
[14149.78s -> 14155.46s]  Just between the four of us those moai statues are real jerks now you just shut your mouth
[14164.30s -> 14169.72s]  Trouble in paradise have fun kids. Don't wait up
[14170.32s -> 14174.87s]  So long you two
[14175.87s -> 14180.71s]  Talk to you talk to you. What about you? This is the one that doesn't like me
[14181.23s -> 14186.43s]  Why the long face? It's just that we've been here for so long and there's so little for us to do
[14186.43s -> 14190.39s]  I have to question the soul-crushing bleakness of our existence and oh
[14191.07s -> 14197.39s]  Wait, you're making fun of me aren't you took him long enough to catch on and the way that sob story was going
[14197.39s -> 14202.19s]  I thought he was about to show us baby pictures and have his sign his yearbook. Not cool
[14203.19s -> 14204.71s]  All right
[14204.71s -> 14210.79s]  One here Joe. Hey, how many volcano gods does it take to screw in a light bulb hackneyed and blasphemous?
[14211.39s -> 14213.39s]  Sheesh up island
[14213.99s -> 14215.59s]  Okay, what do you?
[14215.59s -> 14220.67s]  How about this problem you believe in all this prophecy of destruction mumbo-jumbo? Of course I do
[14220.67s -> 14225.43s]  I can feel run a cow's anger rumbling. Even now me too, Sam
[14225.43s -> 14228.83s]  I think those tamales from stinky's are repeating on me. Ah
[14228.99s -> 14232.07s]  It's got a logical humor very classy
[14233.51s -> 14236.26s]  Don't worry
[14236.26s -> 14242.98s]  Your civilization is coming to a fiery cataclysm again. Don't sweat it. I'm glad you can joke about the end of our civilization
[14242.98s -> 14244.98s]  I don't find it particularly funny
[14246.10s -> 14248.07s]  Okay
[14248.07s -> 14252.07s]  What's your story if you must know I am the keeper of the power of earth
[14253.39s -> 14258.95s]  Why don't you give us a demonstration? I'm not going to unleash the tremendous power of the earth God on just a whim
[14260.51s -> 14265.27s]  Shake the earth. Okay, so shake with your volcano problem. At least you could do is shake things up and win
[14265.27s -> 14270.07s]  This isn't some game. I wasn't granted elemental powers just to amuse you
[14270.27s -> 14275.63s]  Are we gonna have to dig this guy up to get the stick out of his butt? He wasn't always like this
[14276.31s -> 14282.31s]  Double dig that guy out trees ago when the ground would shake with his laughter
[14282.31s -> 14287.47s]  And there was a time when you didn't need a sandblaster to fit in your ceremonial dress
[14287.75s -> 14289.75s]  That was uncalled for
[14290.95s -> 14294.56s]  Okay, got to make this one laugh this one happy
[14295.44s -> 14304.56s]  Hmm. What's the problem man? Stop being so uptight and give us a demonstration. I'm not in the mood get lost
[14304.76s -> 14306.76s]  All right. So how do we make you laugh?
[14307.40s -> 14310.92s]  Don't go anywhere. We'll be back. Is that supposed to be funny?
[14312.16s -> 14313.20s]  Hmm
[14313.20s -> 14315.56s]  so comedy

[14319.99s -> 14321.96s]  don't know about you though
[14322.00s -> 14328.64s]  All right, let's go back to earth and explore a little bit
[14330.67s -> 14333.91s]  Like I have an idea of what's going on here. Can I shoot the fish?
[14334.51s -> 14336.87s]  Sometimes the simplest answer is the easiest one
[14337.51s -> 14362.47s]  So what about the diner anything in here?
[14362.47s -> 14367.19s]  Oh, I can talk to the I remember that they said they wouldn't talk until the I stopped the time
[14367.19s -> 14369.99s]  Howdy cops anything new in the out-of-body business
[14374.19s -> 14376.19s]  Naturally
[14378.59s -> 14385.95s]  Oh, it's a captivating melody composed by a resident musical maestro
[14388.71s -> 14392.79s]  All right enough with the sales pitch how much it is not for sale
[14403.87s -> 14408.82s]  All right, there's a new tell us about the new game
[14411.04s -> 14413.04s]  That is correct
[14420.08s -> 14423.04s]  We are sorry, did we just blow your mind
[14424.72s -> 14430.16s]  I don't like to brag but my prowess at banjo legend extreme is pretty renowned throughout the tri-state area
[14430.48s -> 14437.04s]  And i've been banned from 27 local arcades for playing forbidden dance insurrection in ways the designers never intended
[14437.84s -> 14443.36s]  Does not compute you are saying that music video games already exist
[14445.76s -> 14449.24s]  We play the new game how do we play this game of yours

[14464.04s -> 14466.04s]  We get to being in rhythm with the soundtrack
[14467.80s -> 14475.96s]  Obligated calculating that would require processing power far beyond error not a number
[14476.60s -> 14480.34s]  Just destroy all the to win our exclusive new car horn
[14482.90s -> 14495.25s]  Would you like to play our game let's do it so we have to run stuff over again
[14495.89s -> 14499.33s]  Hello and welcome to the pimp the car music challenge
[14499.89s -> 14504.69s]  Your goal is to drive over the bagpipes and own me the bagpipes don't hit the courty
[14506.13s -> 14512.85s]  Thanks to advance of the nanotechnology at the dark car you can now try using a computer keyboard in addition to your mouth

[14776.68s -> 14778.68s]  What do you know about easter island?
[14779.41s -> 14783.89s]  Who told you to ask me that just some guy outside in a black suit and sunglasses
[14784.37s -> 14786.37s]  Seem to know a lot about you bosco
[14786.37s -> 14788.37s]  They're getting closer
[14789.88s -> 14792.12s]  Bosco has the water been tasting funny to you
[14792.12s -> 14797.08s]  Why am I doing this to him ever since we saw those government guys working on the pipes down the street
[14797.48s -> 14804.92s]  It tastes like control and makes me want to pay taxes good thing. I distill sanitize and recycle my own water
[14807.11s -> 14810.07s]  He he gets it about those black helicopters hovering outside
[14810.63s -> 14813.27s]  Stop trying to freak me out fools. I'm busy
[14814.15s -> 14820.82s]  Hey bosco. Did you know you're being watched? Do you guys even know me? Of course, I know that
[14821.30s -> 14823.94s]  No, we mean right now from inside stinkies
[14824.42s -> 14826.42s]  Y'all just trying to make me paranoid
[14826.66s -> 14832.74s]  You think I don't have a camera inside stinkies. I'd know if I was being watched. Where's the camera?
[14833.14s -> 14834.58s]  It's genius
[14834.58s -> 14839.06s]  Hidden inside the pie that nobody ever eats oops, by the way
[14839.54s -> 14844.66s]  Tell stinky her place would look a lot better if she didn't have that big black lump in the booth
[14844.82s -> 14846.82s]  That looks like a small intestine
[14848.18s -> 14854.29s]  Where you planning to go? Oh, you'd like me to tell you where my emergency bunker is
[14854.85s -> 14858.13s]  No chance you'll have to stop goofing off and bill jones
[14858.53s -> 14865.17s]  It's just like the fable of the grasshopper and the ant if the ant were a paranoid lunatic and the grasshoppers too come to think of it
[14866.45s -> 14872.53s]  All right. Where's the emergency bunker in it? But uh, where's your emergency bunker bosco for the last time?
[14872.93s -> 14876.45s]  My secret bunker's secret location is a secret
[14878.44s -> 14882.20s]  Do you have any honey bunches of pumice brand cereal? Yes
[14882.60s -> 14887.40s]  It's good and it's good for you and it's all for the bunker. We're gonna find the bunker
[14887.48s -> 14893.72s]  Do you have any stem packs and radiation cams fall out? Sure do cool. It wouldn't be a good emergency bunker without them
[14894.98s -> 14896.98s]  Unfortunately, they had to pay
[14897.00s -> 14899.00s]  I think the settlement was
[14899.08s -> 14901.32s]  Four to five million dollars out of court
[14902.44s -> 14904.44s]  Bethesda did not like that at all
[14904.76s -> 14910.44s]  That's kind of sad. Do you have any zombie repellent? Get out of here. There's no such thing as zombies
[14910.92s -> 14913.00s]  That's just what they want you to think
[14917.80s -> 14922.76s]  Do you have any powdered drink mix cases of it in every flavor you can think of?
[14923.24s -> 14928.92s]  Three day old rigatoni stuffed with marshmallow peeps in an orange soda reduction with a hint of cilantro
[14929.40s -> 14931.96s]  Every flavor a normal person can think of
[14933.16s -> 14937.72s]  Is that it? Do you have any high glass repair kits?
[14938.12s -> 14943.32s]  Not much worse than being stuck in the apocalypse with all the time in the world to read and then have your glasses break
[14943.72s -> 14948.36s]  Y'all think i'm an amateur this bunker is going to be 100 irony proof
[14950.79s -> 14956.95s]  Do you have any look for the last time? It's all for the bunker. Give it a rest already
[14961.27s -> 14963.59s]  All right. See you bosco. That's not for long
[14969.32s -> 14975.88s]  It's a combination microwave and x-ray machine perfect. Now we can see what's living inside the burrito and then watch it die
[14976.84s -> 14978.84s]  I don't think there's anything left I can do in here
[14979.08s -> 14982.69s]  I do know about an emergency bunker, which is probably the bathroom
[14983.70s -> 14985.70s]  And it's definitely the bathroom
[14985.78s -> 15000.50s]  Do the grandpa voice
[15000.66s -> 15002.37s]  for what
[15002.37s -> 15004.13s]  Just right now
[15004.13s -> 15009.00s]  Just because nothing else down here
[15013.67s -> 15018.53s]  Let me go into the office
[15020.53s -> 15022.85s]  Wait, wait, wait, was there anything else over here I could do?
[15023.65s -> 15030.34s]  Chew chew teeth miss me already chumps. Well, I ain't coming back no matter how much you beg
[15030.82s -> 15037.54s]  The place just isn't the same without your persistent funk and wheezy starting. Yeah. Well, i'm done with that rat hole
[15037.54s -> 15039.54s]  Happy birthday mega agro

[15047.06s -> 15051.94s]  Because that's all that fucking matters in your birthday party is if somebody brings you something to eat and brings you toys
[15052.50s -> 15054.50s]  That's all that I that's all I get
[15055.14s -> 15057.30s]  Happy birthday. There you go. That's free birthday. No

[15098.76s -> 15100.76s]  finest in remote control fisticuffs
[15101.88s -> 15110.18s]  Leonard looks surprisingly healthy for someone who's been in the closet for six months
[15110.50s -> 15116.18s]  I've been feeding him. Oh you old softy. I've been feeding some way to get rid of all those spiders
[15117.70s -> 15122.45s]  This is a fucked up inhumane shit going on in the closet here
[15129.20s -> 15132.40s]  Just like max this desk is full of handy secret compartments
[15133.36s -> 15136.80s]  Okay desk line. I don't think I think I just gotta keep going
[15137.52s -> 15151.22s]  I think we just have to go back

[15196.05s -> 15198.21s]  I don't think he'd like it here. No outlets
[15198.85s -> 15207.41s]  Well, in any case, that's the perfect melody for my new hit now. Just find me a good train sound and we're all set
[15208.61s -> 15211.81s]  me sound
[15211.81s -> 15217.24s]  Why is there a train?

[15246.13s -> 15251.51s]  Artificial colors flavors preservatives and water. I mean, that's just a gatorade. I would drink this one
[15252.55s -> 15258.88s]  All right. Well, I have the cup now. Can I
[15259.76s -> 15274.08s]  Put this in the fountain youth the piranhas are in there though. What's left of Noah's ark?
[15274.80s -> 15281.41s]  Can I have some of that?
[15281.41s -> 15283.41s]  Maybe something with the portal. Can I like put the
[15285.65s -> 15287.65s]  Cup in the portal or
[15287.97s -> 15291.49s]  They're gonna jump out at me
[15291.89s -> 15293.89s]  Did I get it? Is this fast enough?
[15294.53s -> 15297.81s]  No, I gotta stop them
[15297.81s -> 15302.04s]  Let me just see what happens if I do this
[15302.28s -> 15304.77s]  I'm just curious if I can put things inside
[15306.32s -> 15311.52s]  No, siree
[15311.52s -> 15317.16s]  So how do I take care of this?
[15317.16s -> 15322.61s]  Nope
[15322.61s -> 15325.89s]  Can I actually use the cup on anything that can I fill the cup?
[15326.92s -> 15338.56s]  Hold on. Can I drink one of these or put one in?
[15339.68s -> 15344.72s]  The diaper rash ingredients bourbon guava juice mint and talcum powder
[15344.72s -> 15348.40s]  The only thing that you can't really the talcum powder is the only thing that's not good there. Like can I use it?
[15349.60s -> 15351.60s]  Oh, actually I can I can fill it up
[15361.19s -> 15368.23s]  They've already got their drink

[15402.31s -> 15407.35s]  So is there somebody I can feed this to but I don't think that would work. We just dump it in the piranha pool
[15408.39s -> 15411.65s]  I feel like that's too easy. Does somebody
[15415.49s -> 15417.32s]  try

[15427.22s -> 15432.66s]  I didn't mean to do that. I want it served by a dues paying member of the waitresses union
[15432.98s -> 15440.26s]  How do we get into the waitresses union? Fortunately for you, I am the union leader and also dues collector
[15440.98s -> 15443.30s]  Yeah. Yeah, I know a setup when I see one
[15443.70s -> 15449.78s]  I suppose you want a favor to let us in the union the game has too many jimmies from spilling on the paying customers

[15632.21s -> 15641.62s]  That's what this is for
[15642.18s -> 15646.21s]  There's nothing in it
[15646.21s -> 15648.37s]  It's an empty tea kettle. Okay now put it

[15679.52s -> 15685.76s]  Don't say simulacrum. Well, that's perfect. That's just the sound I need for my big hit
[15686.32s -> 15689.52s]  Let's get started making musical history boys
[15693.57s -> 15697.81s]  Uh, there's a demo on that conch shell this is gonna be you

[15712.71s -> 15714.07s]  Who needs this?
[15714.07s -> 15717.99s]  No, he's already
[15717.99s -> 15722.84s]  I need to get him a drink though. I'm sure they've already heard it
[15723.56s -> 15759.96s]  I know what that is
[15779.43s -> 15781.43s]  Put this through play it will make you happy
[15793.04s -> 15796.48s]  But yes, it's down like toe tapping
[15802.32s -> 15804.32s]  Oh, no whistling sound
[15805.12s -> 15806.00s]  Abe
[15806.00s -> 15808.00s]  Are you even listening to me?

[15865.19s -> 15870.55s]  Come on blow us. You know how to whistle. Don't you just put your stone slabs together and blow
[15871.43s -> 15876.07s]  I think I need something else really in the mood. Well, you're not in the mood fine. Keep up. All right
[15876.07s -> 15878.07s]  So how do I get you to move now?
[15879.83s -> 15882.90s]  Will you move?
[15882.90s -> 15885.46s]  Playtime is over son. We've got important work to do
[15885.70s -> 15892.44s]  I'm expanding my enterprises back here and I'd hate for either of you to get hurt in the construction

[15977.16s -> 15982.52s]  Hey windy sybil, I mean sybil have you ever thought about getting some surgery done?
[15982.76s -> 15988.76s]  What I was thinking if you had your nose stretched out, so maybe you sweared off the head a little you'd look fantastic
[15989.56s -> 15991.56s]  Not that you don't look nice now, of course
[15991.88s -> 15996.52s]  That is it. You've done nothing but stare at her this entire time
[15997.00s -> 16000.68s]  Come on. I'm a man. I'm not made of stone. Well, you know what I mean
[16001.24s -> 16004.84s]  Oh, I know what you mean. All right, you're just in a mood

[16006.92s -> 16012.20s]  I will long remember what you said here and I will never forget what you did here
[16012.60s -> 16015.08s]  I just can't believe you'd insult me like this
[16015.56s -> 16018.12s]  And on my birthday happy birthday sybil
[16019.24s -> 16024.20s]  I said birthday today makes you have a good one to have a picnic and have some toys. That's what I want

[16046.44s -> 16050.76s]  Well that happened but we have an important task to do it's give alcohol to a baby
[16066.52s -> 16068.12s]  Say bye now
[16068.12s -> 16079.08s]  Let's try some water
[16079.08s -> 16081.64s]  Bourbon is not going to do it artificial preservatives is
[16092.48s -> 16093.84s]  I was thinking
[16093.84s -> 16095.28s]  give him the
[16095.28s -> 16108.68s]  fountain of youth
[16108.68s -> 16122.96s]  You just don't want water? Thank you. I've
[16123.60s -> 16125.76s]  It's probably the I've got to get the piranhas out of there
[16129.49s -> 16134.05s]  I don't think we've ever tried to stop a volcano before not unless you count that time in the philippines
[16137.73s -> 16140.05s]  Let's take in some sites or vice versa
[16141.49s -> 16145.01s]  It's definitely the fountain of youth and you feed it to him
[16148.16s -> 16149.12s]  but
[16149.12s -> 16155.52s]  We have another scenario over here things didn't go so well with sybil, huh? Yeah, she was cramping my style. Anyway
[16156.08s -> 16158.08s]  So miss moai
[16158.08s -> 16161.52s]  How you doing get bent beauty?
[16161.92s -> 16163.92s]  Fair enough
[16164.00s -> 16165.36s]  Okay
[16165.36s -> 16170.47s]  What's left of noah's art?
[16170.63s -> 16176.31s]  So, uh to put in a good word for you with sybil. Nah, i've still got a shot with the locals
[16176.95s -> 16185.27s]  Not even after another thousand years. Wow. I haven't seen rejection on that scale since I walked you in the last election
[16186.47s -> 16192.07s]  Don't you think it's amazing that you found that picnic basket full of food. I've got more important things
[16192.23s -> 16194.95s]  Should I go talk to sybil maybe I should go talk to sybil
[16196.23s -> 16198.23s]  What's back there what's left of noah's art?
[16199.03s -> 16201.33s]  They're gong back here
[16201.41s -> 16204.36s]  Looks like another gold gong
[16208.07s -> 16209.65s]  What?
[16209.65s -> 16211.97s]  There's no way I could reach that how do I get over there?
[16212.85s -> 16216.60s]  Now we have five community subs from splarg
[16217.32s -> 16218.76s]  Thank you splarg
[16218.76s -> 16220.93s]  For your five subs. Thank you
[16224.20s -> 16235.22s]  That has to mean something. I don't think I can reach that. I don't think I can shoot it from here
[16235.86s -> 16239.11s]  Are you serious? I don't need the gong
[16240.07s -> 16242.82s]  Well, what am I supposed to put over there?
[16243.38s -> 16260.98s]  Check this out max. What happens?
[16261.06s -> 16265.57s]  Is there anything over here?
[16265.57s -> 16267.57s]  I don't think this will uh
[16268.37s -> 16279.97s]  Nothing doing damn. All right. Well, that's probably for that's the volcano
[16284.92s -> 16287.16s]  here
[16287.16s -> 16297.25s]  Hold on and blow the whistle into here. She's gonna blow and it's gonna come out the other side
[16298.05s -> 16300.52s]  Watch this ready
[16300.52s -> 16306.29s]  No, it's not what you'd probably make more friends if you'd just denunciate more clearly
[16310.12s -> 16340.98s]  What would that that line that wouldn't accomplish anything but what do I get to do with that? It's a silver gong. Can I
[16342.64s -> 16356.02s]  No way
[16356.02s -> 16358.02s]  No, no, that's not gonna do it. Is it?
[16362.08s -> 16363.84s]  No, it's not
[16363.84s -> 16367.51s]  Something has to come out of here. Wait, hold on
[16393.57s -> 16395.09s]  You seem irritable
[16395.09s -> 16397.09s]  Want to talk about it?

[16441.73s -> 16443.97s]  I want to do this fast
[16443.97s -> 16446.85s]  Not fast enough
[16453.91s -> 16460.64s]  No

[16744.66s -> 16746.66s]  Um, you can't kill us we're famous
[16747.22s -> 16750.50s]  Be reasonable seahorse monkeys, but your spatula is evil
[16751.06s -> 16756.98s]  Your high priest is a false prophet that very serious claim to make
[16757.46s -> 16764.42s]  Could make us lose tax exempt status. How are you back it up with a filet knife and some sushi rice
[16764.90s -> 16769.00s]  kill them
[16769.00s -> 16771.48s]  Uh, you can't kill us. We're famous. You can't execute us

[16786.28s -> 16790.04s]  He our only can do it to mighty feet
[16791.16s -> 16798.29s]  Okay

[16802.93s -> 16804.21s]  What are you anyway?
[16804.21s -> 16810.69s]  We are the underfoot protectors of the sacred home of ranakao the volcano god
[16811.17s -> 16814.05s]  The airbreathers call us ocean chimps
[16814.69s -> 16816.69s]  We know like that name
[16818.64s -> 16823.60s]  Okay enough of these we know that imposter is lying because max is the true high priest
[16824.48s -> 16828.32s]  He does have feet maybe shulu's dog speaks the truth
[16829.04s -> 16835.76s]  Look, we ancient civilization that worship giant feet who speak to us through ghost fish high priest
[16836.08s -> 16841.04s]  We're not gullible if white one with mouth truly is high priest
[16841.60s -> 16844.82s]  He prove it by fulfilling the ancient prophecies
[16845.68s -> 16852.40s]  I bet there are three of them. He knows our ancient traditions. Maybe he really is the chosen one
[16852.80s -> 16859.52s]  Ancient say that an outsider will be anointed by the feet the feet will recognize him
[16860.00s -> 16863.60s]  And he will perform great miracle to feed his people
[16863.76s -> 16867.20s]  He was feeding these water becomes delicious treats
[16867.68s -> 16873.28s]  And the island itself will show us the face of the true high priest
[16873.84s -> 16876.56s]  He appears before us in the living rock
[16878.69s -> 16880.29s]  Ah

[16888.29s -> 16893.81s]  The outsiders stand under the great feet. They move to show they accept him
[16895.09s -> 16898.84s]  Okay
[16898.84s -> 16902.12s]  What kind of miracle are you guys looking for prophecy say

[16910.92s -> 16918.30s]  Banang eat delicious banana flavor drink that fortified with essential vitamins and minerals
[16921.16s -> 16922.92s]  That's the fake water
[16922.92s -> 16926.85s]  with banana flavoring
[16926.85s -> 16933.25s]  What do you mean about the island showing his true face prophecy say image of true high priest
[16933.57s -> 16936.13s]  Will appear to us in the cavern
[16936.77s -> 16940.77s]  That prove our high priest is the one look

[16956.95s -> 16961.99s]  Rock next to it look exactly like high priest though. It's miracle
[16962.79s -> 16964.87s]  All right, so we have to put his ears down
[16965.83s -> 16967.83s]  All that is max in a nutshell
[16968.23s -> 16974.31s]  We believe it when we see it we fair people we give you until soon down
[16974.71s -> 16978.31s]  You prove white one is high priest and we know kill you
[16980.10s -> 16981.68s]  Okay
[16981.68s -> 16984.40s]  So we need to make max we're going to take max's head
[16985.12s -> 16987.12s]  We got to cut his ears off

[16993.38s -> 16995.38s]  Oil or something. We'll just slick him back
[16995.86s -> 17002.58s]  And then we need to feed them a banana flavored water and then we have to go get worshipped by the feet
[17004.48s -> 17010.74s]  All right. We want to get max anointed up
[17014.56s -> 17016.56s]  Okay, we humor you

[17021.68s -> 17027.04s]  Do you recognize this white stranger as your servant whose feet are these though?
[17040.47s -> 17043.99s]  Give it a minute. The feet just don't recognize me without the mustache
[17044.31s -> 17046.31s]  You waste our time
[17047.35s -> 17053.99s]  Say you not high priest we killed him now. No, we must wait for sundown

[17580.08s -> 17584.75s]  Let me go just look at it for a second
[17585.63s -> 17590.88s]  Here's this one. The water cooler is one of the most often repeated forms appearing in nature
[17591.36s -> 17598.44s]  So the something right next to his head
[17599.72s -> 17603.76s]  He has one right next to him, right?
[17603.76s -> 17607.53s]  It's this one
[17607.53s -> 17623.98s]  Go back down because it's one two three, right?
[17624.70s -> 17627.90s]  Maybe not that way. Wait, what do you mean wrong?

[17644.54s -> 17645.58s]  No
[17645.58s -> 17650.36s]  What?
[17650.36s -> 17652.80s]  It's the middle one
[17652.80s -> 17661.07s]  No, i'm trying to activate the stalagmite next to him

[17686.48s -> 17688.78s]  The music doesn't do anything to the third one
[17688.78s -> 17692.78s]  Now that this this is a portal right and this is the one next to him if I activate that I can like reach
[17692.78s -> 17702.73s]  In right?
[17702.73s -> 17714.19s]  All right, so max get up there. Let's get max anointed again

[17723.08s -> 17726.60s]  Do you recognize this white stranger as your servant?
[17727.48s -> 17735.80s]  I thought it would look like a portal. It could be like a portal
[17741.85s -> 17744.76s]  look

[18910.42s -> 18911.54s]  smoke
[18911.54s -> 18929.65s]  No, I know I can activate it by shooting it, but I don't know what I need to do with it something
[18929.81s -> 18938.32s]  I don't even know why I still have this
[18942.90s -> 18945.94s]  I'm i'm stuck. I'm kind of stuck. I am but

[19109.68s -> 19114.16s]  Not bad enough to turn the stream off but annoying enough where it happens, right?
[19119.92s -> 19121.68s]  It's definitely manageable
[19121.68s -> 19125.28s]  But now it's not good enough. You're fixing it again cocks
[19126.00s -> 19141.30s]  Is there something in here that I didn't do?
[19143.81s -> 19146.53s]  Can I take something out of can I take the banana out?
[19147.25s -> 19149.73s]  I drink something ceremonial feeding her
[19150.29s -> 19163.38s]  Not happening. Damn it. What about this? I can't open this thing
[19165.23s -> 19169.87s]  It's the entrance to the lava machine only used by a high priest
[19177.65s -> 19181.33s]  Oh for the love of god
[19181.33s -> 19183.17s]  What the fuck?
[19183.17s -> 19185.41s]  There's enough this another portal in here

[19192.94s -> 19196.86s]  Well, that's red sea snail. I hope that's red ink and not
[19197.42s -> 19202.24s]  Something else the world beneath the sea is both wondrous and completely disgusting
[19207.68s -> 19211.81s]  Okay
[19211.81s -> 19213.81s]  That gong doesn't need to be painted
[19213.97s -> 19220.45s]  I've got to paint a gong. I've got to paint the gong but red it's it's orange. It's not red
[19221.41s -> 19229.98s]  Do I have to go paint that gong?
[19233.62s -> 19236.42s]  Yeah, but like this I have to paint the gong red
[19245.71s -> 19247.71s]  No, siree. Let's go see what it does
[19260.24s -> 19263.73s]  All right, let's go paint it

[19317.33s -> 19321.17s]  It's science. We can now activate and deactivate red
[19322.45s -> 19323.97s]  activate red
[19323.97s -> 19327.49s]  Really expected that to work. Ah
[19329.09s -> 19334.85s]  It pulls the biggest reddest thing here. How was I gonna connect those two? That's I what what?
[19335.81s -> 19351.74s]  It's huge and red. I what
[19352.30s -> 19354.54s]  That was a tough one that was tricky
[19355.97s -> 19357.97s]  It's obvious. What? No, it's not
[19360.40s -> 19362.24s]  It's not that obvious
[19362.24s -> 19372.72s]  It's tricky
[19372.72s -> 19376.40s]  Colors. Yeah, but I didn't know this one was connected to a gong. How would I know that?
[19378.61s -> 19379.97s]  All right, let's do it
[19379.97s -> 19386.05s]  And I gotta go find like a snail with blood coming out of its ass or whatever it was

[19669.18s -> 19670.67s]  sad
[19670.67s -> 19674.35s]  Funny so-called high priest. What have you to say for yourself?
[19676.75s -> 19678.99s]  I thought we were pals. He said
[19681.31s -> 19683.31s]  Then he spit derisively
[19683.79s -> 19687.28s]  Me
[19687.28s -> 19688.72s]  Now he say
[19688.72s -> 19690.72s]  Me welcome death
[19690.72s -> 19697.76s]  Better than suffer tyranny of imprisonment on stale beach flakes. I knew I should have taken him for more walks
[19698.32s -> 19700.32s]  I blame myself. I blame you
[19702.64s -> 19708.56s]  Now he say you think you won sam and max you really just step in trap
[19708.96s -> 19714.80s]  I send triangle to summon you here and your stupid primitives to waste your time

[19722.14s -> 19728.72s]  fascist oppressor sam and max get herbal tea and foot rubs once and for all that doesn't sound so bad
[19729.12s -> 19734.32s]  Is this thing going faster? Now? He's saying that not what I said at all
[19734.96s -> 19740.56s]  Me confused not herbal tea and foot rubs rain or fire and drowning magma
[19740.96s -> 19742.32s]  I always
[19742.32s -> 19745.28s]  Should have taken the express part now. He's taking a long time
[19745.84s -> 19748.64s]  Sam and max come to your doom
[19749.44s -> 19751.44s]  In my spectral form

[19800.42s -> 19802.96s]  What do we do?
[19802.96s -> 19808.56s]  We press this emergency button. It says in case of emergency press it sam press it
[19808.88s -> 19810.88s]  I suppose now is as good a time as any
[19813.49s -> 19816.93s]  Uh
[19816.93s -> 19823.62s]  That did nothing more we can do here max. Let's go up top and check out the situation what?
[19825.14s -> 19829.78s]  Turn off the volcano like this. It's too late. The volcano's already going to a rock. All right
[19829.78s -> 19832.58s]  Well, we just okay get it done. Let's go go go come on. Hurry
[19833.46s -> 19835.46s]  With some pep in your step
[19835.62s -> 19839.30s]  Hey, look, I had the parking brake on that whole time. Whoops
[19842.30s -> 19850.69s]  All right, what did that do up here we need to see what's going on outside
[19859.87s -> 19865.55s]  Bloody-nosed euclid doing the eucarist on a nitro-burning catamaran. That's the second biggest bermuda triangle
[19865.63s -> 19868.43s]  I've ever seen seems to be spinning out of control, too
[19869.87s -> 19871.87s]  Now this one's getting up
[19872.51s -> 19877.87s]  That one is it went inside the only way home. I fail to see how this is helpful in an emergency
[19878.27s -> 19881.33s]  This is it. The volcano is about to explode
[19884.94s -> 19886.94s]  Help us sam and max
[19887.90s -> 19890.05s]  I'll try
[19890.05s -> 19892.45s]  But hold on. I forgot to get the thing that fell
[19901.62s -> 19907.76s]  run this thing
[19908.93s -> 19912.13s]  High priest medallion. It's the official signet of the ocean chimp's high priest
[19913.09s -> 19918.03s]  Don't I get to wear it? We don't have a chain long enough to fit around your enormous head chump
[19918.51s -> 19920.51s]  Okay, anything else sock crown?
[19930.85s -> 19932.13s]  You look right
[19932.13s -> 19936.45s]  Any more snail trail? It's that sea snail's disgusting red residue
[19937.17s -> 19940.37s]  All right, so I got
[19940.37s -> 19942.62s]  coin
[19942.70s -> 19948.16s]  Conk well, I did that. So now let's see so I have
[19948.88s -> 19956.99s]  All right, hold on
[19956.99s -> 19959.15s]  Cup of the snail trail. I maybe let's see
[19963.58s -> 19973.82s]  This one's pink
[19973.82s -> 19977.34s]  So we got that's I can act definitely have to do something with the one in the back
[19989.94s -> 19991.94s]  What do I have to do with this?
[19996.26s -> 19998.26s]  May I make pink maybe?
[20012.38s -> 20014.46s]  Can I scoop it up? I mean I need to make pink
[20023.38s -> 20029.54s]  No way. Nah
[20029.54s -> 20031.54s]  I still have to use it. Okay
[20032.35s -> 20034.75s]  Well, I have a red coin
[20037.07s -> 20040.19s]  red and blue makes pink red and green
[20043.12s -> 20046.86s]  red and
[20046.86s -> 20048.86s]  Red makes red and white
[20068.03s -> 20072.11s]  Well, i'm just going by previous logic that we had to paint the gong a different color
[20076.75s -> 20078.75s]  Maybe I have to paint the gong a different color now
[20086.27s -> 20089.23s]  Now it's a fucking call back to the beginning of the game
[20090.40s -> 20097.07s]  Hold on
[20097.07s -> 20106.03s]  Watch this
[20106.03s -> 20125.25s]  He's gonna stop what did that not work?
[20126.59s -> 20131.47s]  Uh, I hope there's nobody on the other side of that triangle. I thought I had to do way more than that
[20131.55s -> 20133.55s]  You said it dude, bro
[20133.55s -> 20140.29s]  You've done it. You've broken the prophecy. You've saved our ancient civilization from destruction
[20142.59s -> 20148.91s]  So sweet thing now that's over with let's say you and I find somewhere private to get
[20149.69s -> 20154.75s]  Sedimentary so accomplishment is something we've been screaming for 10 minutes time apart your loss
[20155.31s -> 20160.83s]  Can I get a ride with you guys? You guys like think i'm just sitting with my face into the other monitor going
[20160.91s -> 20162.11s]  Just where's the answer?
[20162.11s -> 20166.19s]  Mr. Lincoln only one way to find out I have to like click on the screen
[20166.27s -> 20170.59s]  But and I have to look at the screen. No, no, I have to look over here the whole time. Yes. I got it
[20170.91s -> 20177.95s]  Thank god. I guess we just sit here for another few thousand years. That's what I do
[20179.07s -> 20181.07s]  That sucks
[20181.07s -> 20208.24s]  Where's the music?
[20208.24s -> 20218.27s]  Imagine talking over the ending I could hear it just fine. No, I didn't mute anything
[20229.90s -> 20231.90s]  Is this supposed to be playing music?
[20231.90s -> 20256.58s]  It's all right. Don't worry. I'll I'll show it again. Yeah, maybe we lost the uh, the window is
[20257.22s -> 20273.44s]  Yeah, the window is on the music stops if you take too long take too long doing what the episode
[20276.35s -> 20278.67s]  I took like, I don't know. What was that like an hour and 20 minutes?
[20285.06s -> 20304.80s]  Isn't the general time for these like an hour to two hours? All right, shut up. Sorry. I had to stop talking
[20315.66s -> 20339.60s]  Here we go, you guys want to see the ending no see you guys in five minutes
[20339.84s -> 20354.13s]  I hope there's nobody on the other side of that triangle. I don't care. Uh
[20354.85s -> 20359.41s]  You said it dude, bro. You've done it. You've broken the prophecy
[20359.57s -> 20363.59s]  You've saved our ancient civilization from destruction
[20365.97s -> 20372.29s]  So sweet thing now that's over with let's say you and I find somewhere private to get
[20373.07s -> 20374.77s]  Sedimentary. Yeah
[20374.85s -> 20381.81s]  I think we should spend some time apart your loss. Can I get a ride with you guys? Our portal back home is gone
[20381.97s -> 20383.97s]  We're gonna have to swim
[20384.86s -> 20389.82s]  Do you float mr? Lincoln only one way to find out I get to ride on his do-lap
[20390.06s -> 20392.06s]  You can only call that once we get in the water
[20395.26s -> 20400.14s]  I guess we just sit here for another few thousand years
[20402.66s -> 20404.66s]  That sucks
[20405.76s -> 20407.28s]  Okay, so
[20407.28s -> 20412.00s]  Everyone was so upset that I spoke over the last four sentences of the game. Let's see what we have to do it again
[20427.47s -> 20434.43s]  Again with the music it's to say you i'll put it on youtube here now
[20434.51s -> 20458.88s]  I gotta do it again because the music's not there. Can I get it?
[20459.44s -> 20468.85s]  No, this is that's this is this is the rick and morty's ending credits. All right, that's it

[20849.10s -> 20861.62s]  What what what are you talking about? What are we mad about tonight lads?
[20862.10s -> 20874.42s]  It's not funny when you're mean to chat with mean to the person that mean to the one person that told me that they said
[20874.50s -> 20876.50s]  My stream was gonna be shit tomorrow
[20877.68s -> 20879.12s]  What?
[20879.12s -> 20881.15s]  That's one guy
[20881.15s -> 20883.63s]  Who was rude so I was rude back
[20884.59s -> 20889.06s]  What?
[20889.06s -> 20893.58s]  What are you talking about?
[20893.58s -> 20895.74s]  This is this is copypasta bullshit
[20904.37s -> 20908.34s]  What would jesus do he'd say hey cut it out asshole
[20909.98s -> 20925.47s]  That's what he would say. I don't think jesus would know english. He might
[20925.95s -> 20937.34s]  They're copypasting but when I said it I meant it
[20938.67s -> 20940.05s]  What?
[20940.05s -> 20943.12s]  That what are you talking about?
[20943.12s -> 20945.12s]  No, this is this is just bullshit
[20951.09s -> 20954.05s]  That one guy has a now permanent bias
[20954.69s -> 20963.20s]  Yeah, i'm i'm permanently getting t
[20972.99s -> 20974.99s]  One guy has so much power
[20976.61s -> 20980.53s]  When I look over here and I say here's what for the fourth stream in a row this week
[20981.81s -> 20984.37s]  Hey, I had this idea of playing like ms dos games
[20985.09s -> 20987.49s]  Now that's gonna suck that stream sucks
[20988.35s -> 20993.71s]  Like what like what what do you want me to do be like, yes, of course it will suck. You've got a great great idea
[20993.79s -> 20996.10s]  Good. Thank you
[20996.10s -> 20998.62s]  what
[20998.62s -> 21017.62s]  What do you what?
[21017.62s -> 21020.66s]  Don't acknowledge the one guy. I mean i'm i'm partially
[21021.38s -> 21025.04s]  Kidding when I acknowledge that
[21025.04s -> 21027.04s]  But I am gonna i'm gonna fight back
[21027.04s -> 21031.22s]  I'm a fighter
[21031.22s -> 21037.54s]  I lost in the first round when I got in that fight in high school
[21039.23s -> 21045.01s]  First round got KO'd I got the wrong thing up here
[21045.57s -> 21055.10s]  And then after that I took a vow to never ever fight anybody ever again
[21063.52s -> 21073.49s]  Back in 86
[21073.49s -> 21088.34s]  That was that was the smartest thing i've ever done. But anyways, yes, I will see you tomorrow
[21103.38s -> 21106.02s]  What games are we gonna play that's for up to you to decide
[21109.12s -> 21111.12s]  Because i'm gonna turn on smart clicks
[21111.36s -> 21121.42s]  So you'll be able to decide that I know there's a lot of things on there that I might not be able to stream
[21123.98s -> 21125.04s]  so
[21125.04s -> 21137.92s]  Gonna have to be careful with that one. You gotta get it right

[21296.14s -> 21298.04s]  that I saw you at
[21298.04s -> 21303.90s]  Nando's last night. I wanted to come say hi, but you were shouting profanities at the 16 year old busboy
[21304.46s -> 21306.62s]  Because kim only let you use the kids menu
[21306.94s -> 21312.86s]  I found it awkward when you dd teed the chef through table and then started harassing an elderly couple about how you kicked their ass
[21312.86s -> 21314.62s]  in the germa rumble
[21314.62s -> 21319.26s]  It got so bad that the police showed up but you escaped through the back door while carrying a box of cheeses
[21320.06s -> 21327.87s]  Why do I always have to like be?
[21328.45s -> 21332.29s]  This like insane person that's hurting people and breaking things
[21335.86s -> 21338.02s]  there's nowhere like a copy pasta here of like
[21338.66s -> 21340.66s]  I saw germa out at
[21340.66s -> 21344.10s]  Wendy's and he high-fived the guy in the window and gave him a
[21344.56s -> 21346.98s]  $100 tip and then turned around and winked at me
[21351.57s -> 21359.26s]  And in the back was a bunch of puppies that he was saving. It's never that it's always like I break shit and hurt people
[21359.98s -> 21365.31s]  Because they're telling the true stories. Yeah, there you go
[21368.30s -> 21372.51s]  That's unrealistic
[21372.51s -> 21390.46s]  You would do those things
[21390.46s -> 21391.66s]  Uh, thank you
[21391.66s -> 21392.78s]  I
[21392.78s -> 21394.16s]  zek

[21402.08s -> 21405.60s]  Got a good laugh out of me on an otherwise depressing birthday. Well, happy birthday. That's

[21416.70s -> 21418.70s]  But thank you the five dollars
[21418.94s -> 21419.82s]  I
[21419.82s -> 21422.43s]  We kind of were just talking about a random bunch of bullshit
[21423.15s -> 21425.15s]  Hope you thought it was funny glad you did
[21427.78s -> 21430.42s]  Hope you have a better. Uh, hope you have a better birthday
[21431.06s -> 21434.67s]  Sorry to hear that. It wasn't very good. Happy birthday though

[21448.51s -> 21453.89s]  I didn't even do it right
[21453.89s -> 21456.85s]  But thank you. Thank you zack or zake again for the 250
[21457.49s -> 21461.65s]  Well, pretty cool that you have a black belt in karate. I didn't know that they use hockey pads in karate, too
[21462.13s -> 21465.17s]  PS have you ever thought about doing morning streams for eu boys?
[21466.42s -> 21468.10s]  Uh after yesterday
[21468.10s -> 21472.50s]  I thought this one might have been a little like an hour or two early, but no, I just wasn't able to do it
[21473.70s -> 21480.02s]  But not really planned on it. Unfortunately, I know there's a lot of people that want it but I have to be
[21481.49s -> 21485.73s]  Ready to stream and in a streaming mood and doesn't really happen that often in the morning
[21487.97s -> 21492.77s]  And for me to do an eu friendly stream, I have to start at at least you know, nine ten o'clock in the morning
[21492.77s -> 21493.97s]  It is not
[21493.97s -> 21495.81s]  That highly energetic
[21495.81s -> 21505.44s]  in the morning
[21505.44s -> 21509.28s]  But they will happen randomly from time to time like you see them already a couple times
[21515.62s -> 21521.06s]  Uh, thank you ranzor for the three bucks. No messages. Just three dollars. Thank you ranzor
[21522.13s -> 21526.53s]  Bimber ten. Thanks for the five dollars. Hey jeremy. I would eat my toes if you played no one lives forever, too
[21527.52s -> 21531.36s]  A spy in harm's way. It's a classic game that I think you would love it'd be entertaining to watch
[21536.75s -> 21538.70s]  um
[21538.70s -> 21544.06s]  I've never heard of it
[21544.06s -> 21548.90s]  But I admit maybe if I think it's something that's fun and worth streaming
[21550.70s -> 21557.78s]  I don't know. We had a lot of feet on stream today
[21558.50s -> 21562.93s]  Yeah, there was
[21562.93s -> 21566.93s]  German lied about taco bell. Thanks for the 250 mega mind for germa rumble
[21572.56s -> 21583.47s]  Good old mega mind
[21583.47s -> 21585.23s]  No mega minds
[21585.23s -> 21591.49s]  I'll get in trouble. Somebody will sue me. You never played it. It's
[21592.21s -> 21594.21s]  Look at the tricycle mine level
[21597.92s -> 21601.12s]  Bought 50 from bala koala earlier. Thank you so much bala koala

[21635.86s -> 21643.02s]  What's on the collar? Is it a flower?
[21643.26s -> 21656.11s]  That's a pretty great cat
[21656.11s -> 21659.15s]  Uh, somebody said you ever just sniff your monitor. No never
[21665.12s -> 21668.16s]  that was um earlier it was a bit message, but I

[21672.56s -> 21683.76s]  Freudian weapon. Thanks for the 250 don't listen to the rude guys. Your streams are always fun
[21685.06s -> 21693.73s]  I'm gonna fight back
[21693.73s -> 21696.93s]  No, I know people were fucking around 95 percent of the time
[21697.57s -> 21704.10s]  But i'm yeah, i'm dead if we're gonna if we're gonna have a back and forth scenario here. I'm gonna fight back
[21704.82s -> 21714.59s]  You can hear him flex. You just like fucking muscles are just exploding
[21725.63s -> 21730.11s]  I'm serious
[21730.11s -> 21738.21s]  Chat rumble
[21738.21s -> 21740.64s]  You want to hear me flex?
[21741.92s -> 21746.45s]  Just popped up
[21746.45s -> 21750.06s]  Try it again
[21750.06s -> 21751.02s]  Oh
[21751.02s -> 21753.42s]  That one that one was that one hit the ceiling
[21764.54s -> 21766.54s]  Most of the time you guys realize that
[21767.34s -> 21771.42s]  Whenever somebody if I say something where i'm like, oh fucking ray, what the fuck fuck you
[21772.22s -> 21774.78s]  i'm usually just fucking around
[21775.10s -> 21777.23s]  we have all kinds of
[21777.23s -> 21778.35s]  in
[21778.35s -> 21780.35s]  channel kind of back and forth
[21781.73s -> 21782.78s]  that
[21782.78s -> 21783.74s]  are
[21783.74s -> 21791.63s]  Fun, right?
[21791.63s -> 21794.43s]  But i'm i'm what you what do you want me to say?
[21801.39s -> 21803.39s]  I I can't like pretend
[21804.27s -> 21809.30s]  You hurt my feelings. What about my feelings?
[21816.70s -> 21818.70s]  You you took it too far
[21819.18s -> 21820.22s]  What?
[21820.22s -> 21826.66s]  I spent the whole last 10 minutes of the stream. I mean people tell me how stupid I was
[21827.22s -> 21829.22s]  How dumb of a person I am
[21829.22s -> 21834.59s]  That was that was like the last 20 minutes of that was like actually the about six hours of the stream
[21838.74s -> 21841.30s]  So wait, i'm allowed to take the harassment here
[21843.42s -> 21851.62s]  huh
[21851.62s -> 21853.62s]  When I say one thing
[21867.82s -> 21876.08s]  In like a joking manner all of a sudden i'm like the joker from batman
[21890.05s -> 21907.46s]  I get to be the one guy sometimes come on
[21908.22s -> 21911.82s]  You gotta give me a little bit. I like you gotta give me a little bit of slack
[21923.97s -> 21929.66s]  We fuck around here a lot but half the shit that is said in this stream would get you banned somewhere else
[21930.06s -> 21949.70s]  And you know it come on. So we have a pretty light atmosphere here
[21950.02s -> 21980.24s]  I say a lot of shit and get banned for it be the bigger person in any room
[21980.88s -> 21986.32s]  Oh, I get it. See? All right. So, all right. All right. Look at that. Look it's being spanned right now
[21987.18s -> 21990.46s]  Look, do you see this? You see like what?

[22015.26s -> 22017.26s]  And I look over and I see a shit talk

[22040.53s -> 22072.85s]  But anyways, let us move on the coffee pasta is so elaborate because
[22074.26s -> 22076.26s]  People can come up with some crazy shit
[22083.46s -> 22089.71s]  But we had let's uh, almost at the end here. We had ten dollars from all mu for thank you all mu
[22089.95s -> 22099.68s]  Hey, germa was out with my girlfriend the other night at a bar. We were pleasantly surprised to see you
[22100.24s -> 22102.56s]  Kim and shito there, but you seemed a little off
[22102.96s -> 22106.48s]  I saw that you ordered enough pbr to make yourself almost pass out and even be sick
[22107.04s -> 22111.60s]  we didn't want to go up and say anything because we saw shito and kim carrying you home as you stumbled and
[22112.16s -> 22114.08s]  a drunk fit
[22114.08s -> 22117.76s]  I just want to ask what's the deal with you lying so much. I really want you to be a better person
[22125.97s -> 22131.33s]  Thank you for the ten dollars. I appreciate i'm gonna i'm drinking pbr tomorrow
[22132.90s -> 22135.46s]  Mark my words, I will drink that gross liquid
[22142.77s -> 22145.17s]  Germa lied about taco bell. Thanks for the 250
[22145.89s -> 22148.85s]  I saw germa out at a wendy's he high-fived the cashier and then winked at me
[22148.85s -> 22152.93s]  He was super nice to everyone right up until he pulled his pants down and shit on the floor
[22158.32s -> 22163.78s]  Son of jenova, thanks for the three dollars. Hi. I love you. Watch this, please
[22163.78s -> 22165.78s]  It's probably what's gonna happen to you tomorrow
[22182.37s -> 22184.93s]  Hey, don't tell him penis
[22189.65s -> 22191.81s]  I'm not allowed to do that. Come on
[22206.53s -> 22208.53s]  Nobody said you can't
[22219.92s -> 22222.88s]  It probably is what's gonna happen, but i'll be i'll be on top of it. Don't worry
[22223.44s -> 22226.40s]  I'm gonna flex my fucking tiny muscles
[22227.12s -> 22234.96s]  Why are you so mean to us? I'm not i'm not what?
[22236.08s -> 22238.56s]  I know this is just a die. No, everyone just fucking with me now
[22239.20s -> 22281.04s]  Where's the sour place? Come on. I was there it is. That's what I was waiting for
[22288.02s -> 22294.13s]  Thank you, though. I will be on top of it. Don't worry. Hey, uh shinoda. Thanks for the 250
[22294.13s -> 22296.37s]  Hey germa, are you going to join the vine sauce charity stream?
[22296.93s -> 22300.27s]  It'd be good time for vine wrestle versus germa rumble with joe
[22301.38s -> 22302.50s]  I don't know
[22302.50s -> 22304.18s]  That's a really good question
[22304.18s -> 22305.86s]  i'll have to
[22305.86s -> 22308.22s]  I don't really have an answer for you
[22308.22s -> 22313.23s]  But it's a great charity. They do awesome stuff
[22315.23s -> 22319.31s]  They do it every year, right? So I mean, I maybe we'll see I I can't give you an answer
[22319.31s -> 22321.63s]  I don't want to tell you that's gonna happen and then it doesn't right so
[22322.35s -> 22328.45s]  But thank you for the 250 definitely something to look into right?
