[0.00s -> 19.35s]  The local vector with target vessel is locked. Operate light screen. Hang and depressurized. Move out to the arming area and careful you don't bang up my flight deck.
[23.54s -> 29.10s]  Right, let's go down the checklist here and make sure you didn't knock any screws loose on a trip over.
[30.91s -> 34.91s]  The old gun head here has got four weapon hardpoints and four item brackets.
[37.18s -> 41.18s]  First up, rattle off a few rounds from the machine gun into the targets.
[42.18s -> 47.59s]  Hey, what's happening everybody? Jerma here with Crypt Dark.
[48.59s -> 51.59s]  Yes, that was me. I was giving myself a tutorial.
[52.59s -> 56.59s]  If you haven't played the game yet, or if you've played it, or if you've been watching the streams I've been doing recently.
[57.59s -> 67.59s]  I did voice work for this game. I am the tutorial-esque character. I pop up time to time in the game and give the player certain hints and tips and various other details on the game.
[68.59s -> 70.59s]  And it's in early access right now. It just came out last week.
[70.59s -> 79.15s]  And it's actually pretty damn fun. I usually don't like to do early access games. I cover them on my channel or talk about them at all or play them.
[80.39s -> 85.39s]  Because a lot of times they're never done. And they're either stuck in like tech demo hell for a long time.
[86.39s -> 89.39s]  Or they're a certain genre that I just really don't care about.
[90.63s -> 93.63s]  But this one in particular, this is by the Apotheon guys, Alien Trap.
[94.87s -> 97.87s]  And it's pretty far along in development. It's close.
[97.87s -> 101.87s]  I think they only want the game in early access for 6-12 months or something.
[102.87s -> 106.87s]  A pretty short turnaround. The game is a start to finish experience at this point.
[107.87s -> 108.87s]  You can actually complete the game.
[109.87s -> 114.05s]  And we'll talk about the game very briefly. It's a roguelike twin stick space shooter.
[115.05s -> 117.05s]  Like Binding of Isaac and Nuclear Throne had a baby and went to space.
[118.05s -> 123.42s]  The whole goal is you go through these places. They're like essentially dungeons that you have to clear.
[124.42s -> 127.42s]  There's a core that you blow up. And once the core is destroyed, you move on.
[128.42s -> 129.42s]  You have to do that seven times.
[130.42s -> 132.42s]  The seventh one is the Cryptarch.
[133.42s -> 138.42s]  And it's an extremely difficult version of all the types of random stuff that you can see in this game.
[139.72s -> 142.72s]  I've not beaten it yet. I've not gotten to the Cryptarch in actually one.
[143.72s -> 144.72s]  I've gotten to it a couple of times.
[145.72s -> 147.72s]  But each one of those times I end up running out of money and lose the game.
[148.72s -> 150.72s]  Because when you die, when your ship explodes, the game isn't over.
[151.72s -> 152.72s]  You don't go to the very beginning again.
[153.72s -> 156.72s]  It's a roguelike in the sense that you have to spend money for your loadouts.
[156.72s -> 162.72s]  So when you run out of money, you don't have any more cash to spend on your loadouts is when the game ends.
[164.02s -> 168.02s]  There's a shitload of weapons and items you can find throughout the game and unlock and equip.
[169.02s -> 170.02s]  That's one of my favorite parts about the whole game.
[171.02s -> 174.02s]  You have four slots for weapons and you can do wacky shit like this.
[175.02s -> 176.02s]  These are four zip guns.
[178.48s -> 179.48s]  Now there's no conceivable reason why you'd ever do this.
[180.48s -> 182.48s]  But you can. You can do it however you want.
[183.48s -> 184.48s]  You can put any amount of items and weapons on.
[185.48s -> 187.48s]  As long as you have the money to support it, you can do it.
[188.91s -> 189.91s]  That's really all I got to say.
[190.91s -> 191.91s]  I just wanted to give a quick little shout out to the game.
[192.91s -> 195.91s]  And I'll leave you with a couple more lines that I say throughout the game.
[196.91s -> 199.15s]  And yeah, it's on Steam. Check it out if you want.
[200.15s -> 203.39s]  It's Crypt Dark. 13 bucks. It's a good one.
[204.70s -> 205.70s]  I would suggest trying it out. It's a good one.
[207.13s -> 208.13s]  Check it out on Steam.
[209.13s -> 210.13s]  The game's out on Steam right now. Check it out on Steam.
[213.10s -> 228.12s]  Checklist cleared. I'll get the angle quite soon.
