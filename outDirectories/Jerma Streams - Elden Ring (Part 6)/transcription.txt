[3.64s -> 17.38s]  Hello. How are you? How are you doing? How are things? You good? What's up? I changed my Twitch
[17.38s -> 29.56s]  server. Let's see if that fixes the problem. Streaming on a different server. If you're not
[29.56s -> 37.16s]  here last night, every like five minutes I would drop like a few hundred frames for no reason. It
[37.16s -> 45.74s]  seemed to happen at the same exact interval. Apparently I have negative latency to your stream.
[45.74s -> 55.22s]  I'm seeing it before you stream it. That's weird. Uh, some people were saying that it might have
[55.22s -> 58.50s]  been a Twitch problem. Maybe the server I was connecting to. So I changed servers. Let's see
[58.50s -> 65.62s]  if it fixes it. If not, then I, unfortunately, don't know what to do about it because my internet
[65.62s -> 78.70s]  seems to be perfect. Today, I'm gonna, I'm gonna be very calm today. I'm going to relax. I'm going
[78.70s -> 87.02s]  to, I'm going to be in Zen mode. I'm not going to get angry today. I'm going to very desperately
[87.02s -> 99.56s]  try to stay focused and my voice will not go over a certain amount of DB level. Okay. It's going to
[99.56s -> 105.91s]  be collected. I'm going to just relax and enjoy the world of Elden Ring because that's all I do
[105.91s -> 115.29s]  now. I'm literally an Elden Ring streamer. I don't do anything else. Uh, but yeah, I'm looking
[115.29s -> 128.23s]  forward to it. It'd be a good time as always. Hey, Jerma the Bod for the what? The Bod for
[128.23s -> 137.14s]  that last boss fight got deleted. Did it? No, it didn't. Don't forget about Smite Saturdays.
[140.60s -> 150.87s]  Did you smoke before this? No. I would never play Elden Ring inebriated. Yeah, that's not going to
[150.87s -> 158.70s]  happen. You understand how impossible that would be? You're asking me to do an impossible task.
[162.78s -> 167.58s]  You can't, like that's like handing somebody that's like just, just zonked out of their mind
[167.58s -> 178.30s]  of Rubik's Cube. Then you have one minute to solve this. Huh? How's this it? It's scabbed over. It
[178.30s -> 194.95s]  looks pretty bad. Whatever. I'm literally doing that right now. It's not that bad. I would be
[194.95s -> 201.99s]  completely de-stressed, but that would be an unwatchable stream because I would walk into
[202.07s -> 209.59s]  boss encounters and die in five seconds and I wouldn't even care. I'd be like, Oh man,
[209.59s -> 213.99s]  that's what he does. Oh, okay. And that would happen for two or three straight hours. Like
[213.99s -> 219.43s]  I wouldn't even attack the boss. So many people like claim that they would stay here and watch
[219.43s -> 226.01s]  that kind of shit. But after an hour or two of doing that, I wouldn't attack the boss.
[227.96s -> 231.40s]  You just, you would go do something else. You'd find something else to do. You just would.
[232.12s -> 242.82s]  That would be the best stream. It would not. It would be an actual improvement. Oh, get out of
[242.82s -> 254.39s]  here. Okay. Uh, you guys ready? It's a couple of things. I, I have marked some things on the map
[254.39s -> 265.03s]  that I want to do. A few of them in particular. I want to continue this quest line for Ranny.
[269.06s -> 280.63s]  Maybe please just do one designated song stream with me strong. All right. I will, I'm, it might
[280.63s -> 293.62s]  be fun to do a, a me strong stream in Elden ring and I would just be role playing. You guys are
[293.62s -> 299.26s]  not going to want to watch it. It's going to be awful. No one's going to do it. No one's going
[299.26s -> 304.30s]  to want to watch that stream. I'm telling you, there's going to be threads on Reddit about this
[304.30s -> 307.42s]  about like, I mean, like that was like, not that funny. It was like kind of fucking like
[307.42s -> 312.54s]  irresponsible and annoying of him. Um, like that was the worst stream 2022 without a doubt. Like
[312.62s -> 316.86s]  it was, that was just boring and like, not funny. You guys are not going to like this stream. I'm
[316.86s -> 323.18s]  just, I want to be, I want to be clipped completely sober of sound mind and sound body. They will be
[323.74s -> 326.30s]  people that they're going to be a lot of people that are going to think that's the worst frame
[326.30s -> 331.83s]  of the year. Okay. I just want to make sure I'm clear on that. So let's just, I'm going to,
[331.83s -> 340.87s]  I'm going to make it so you can't nominate it. It's grayed out. Okay. You guys ready? I'm ready.
[341.51s -> 353.51s]  Let's get into it. Can you guys hear it? You can't. No, you can't. Make sure I've got my fan
[353.51s -> 360.09s]  going already. And even been five minutes. I'm getting that fan going layer blowing on me.
[363.58s -> 390.49s]  That cannot be the way that is though. So use me. I've got like red circles under my eyes. Why?
[391.45s -> 395.88s]  What does that mean? Actually, nothing sits in lighting the way the lighting is in the room.
[396.60s -> 407.18s]  Yeah, it's just weird lighting. All right. I gotta move this out of the way. So last thing we did,
[408.14s -> 412.44s]  by the way, this is the most face cams per capita you've ever had.
[413.32s -> 425.26s]  This is the most face cams you've ever had like in a row. So what? It's something I don't normally
[425.26s -> 432.94s]  do. Okay. I want to show you some stuff. First of all, let me show you some things. I have marked
[433.02s -> 440.17s]  on the map specifically where we are going to go. We're going to go here. I was told by somebody
[440.17s -> 446.06s]  in chat that this is a place that I would be very interested in. So I marked it. I also wanted to
[446.06s -> 454.04s]  make sure that I checked, got this map fragment. I also wanted to check out this place because it
[454.04s -> 462.17s]  looked kind of cool, like a church or something, right? I also wanted to go here. This looked like
[462.17s -> 466.17s]  an interesting boulder of some sort. And I don't know what this spiky stuff is, but this looks like
[466.17s -> 475.99s]  an interesting boulder to me. Zip will go away in like a week. Don't worry. And then I want to
[475.99s -> 484.60s]  continue the quest line. So at the end of that Redan fight, the stars all fell. And I was like,
[484.60s -> 490.28s]  oh, falling stars, falling stars. And I had to go find them. So I'm going to go look over here
[490.28s -> 494.28s]  because from the lore perspective, it sounded like it may have been somewhere
[495.42s -> 501.18s]  around this vicinity, if I were to take a guess. So we're going to check this out here.
[501.82s -> 511.06s]  Permanent Zip. South of the Mistwood. That's what I was thinking too. I was thinking like somewhere
[511.06s -> 518.42s]  in this vicinity here. Because this looks like an area it could fall. Nice cringe lore. That's like
[518.42s -> 527.93s]  one of the coolest parts of all the Dark Souls games is like the lore. Has anybody ever looked
[527.93s -> 534.47s]  at you like that before in your life? I used to get that all the time. I used to get that all of
[534.47s -> 541.48s]  the time. Like it'd be like, something, I'm saying something, saying something. That's equal parts
[541.48s -> 552.09s]  stop and equal parts. What are you doing? What are you saying? Like, yeah, me too.
[552.82s -> 564.57s]  That happened to me too. Yeah. Microwave rant. I need to start to put a tally on how many times
[564.57s -> 574.02s]  that happens to me. It's very distinctive. It's not a book. It's not. Nope. It's not. It's,
[574.58s -> 585.51s]  it's very distinct. It's, it's equally parts confused and upset and kind of like what?
[586.66s -> 594.58s]  All right. Let's go. We're going to check section one, which is this part right here. I'm going to
[594.58s -> 601.51s]  go in order. I heard this is something I'd be interested in. That's the face that I make almost
[601.51s -> 611.26s]  all the time when watching you. You're wicked funny. Okay. So the, how do I get up there though?
[611.82s -> 625.43s]  I was told I'd be very interested in this space here. Okay. I don't think I can get up here this
[625.43s -> 633.58s]  way. All right. There's like some, there's some cringe rocks in the way. How am I going to, from
[633.58s -> 641.22s]  this way? How do I get on this road? This is all, this is the bridge. Okay. So how,
[642.02s -> 647.06s]  I'm going to have to go from here, aren't I? I don't think I can get up there from here.
[652.57s -> 661.35s]  Yeah. I'll go from here or I think I have to go backwards from here. I don't know. Or maybe
[661.35s -> 671.18s]  forwards from here. Let's try forwards from here. Doesn't know how to read a map. You look like
[671.18s -> 674.38s]  some, I don't, I know. I know. I look like everybody you've ever seen in your life.
[677.05s -> 700.66s]  So I need to go this way. Not that way over here. Look like my grandma. That would actually be kind
[700.66s -> 716.25s]  of funny if I really did look like your grandmother. This is just an item here. Fire arrows. Cool.
[716.25s -> 720.49s]  Okay. Let's keep going. I got to follow the, just the path. Yeah. I didn't get a bunch of these
[720.49s -> 729.58s]  things. Hey, can you please kiss the camera? You know how many times I've done that? There's
[729.58s -> 735.96s]  somebody in here. You know how many times I've kissed the camera and regretted it immediately
[735.96s -> 741.61s]  after doing it. Who's this guy? War Master Shaq.
[754.20s -> 763.48s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[763.48s -> 776.12s]  Yeah. Battle arts.
[787.16s -> 796.02s]  Okay. This guy sells battle arts? Ah, okay. Very cool. Well, I don't think I really need any of
[796.02s -> 804.97s]  these or want any of these in this playthrough because I'm a magic magician person. So pretty
[804.97s -> 839.46s]  cool though. What level am I? 60. Oh, knowledge of the arts.
[844.42s -> 849.06s]  All right. See you later. Have fun. Good luck with you. It's the world's wacky out there.
[849.06s -> 853.67s]  Just be careful. That's cool though. I don't need any of that, but that's cool to know that
[853.67s -> 865.00s]  that's what that is. We're going to continue. I want to go that way. I had a dream last night
[865.00s -> 875.27s]  that you did an in-person event. You were there. You did an in-person event. You did an IRL like
[875.27s -> 880.31s]  tier list, like live show. What? It's like kind of fun. What are you talking about?
[890.10s -> 897.35s]  Ooh, this is a new space. All right. What's, what's here? There's probably something here
[897.35s -> 910.18s]  that I didn't get. Jort sword. Oh, come on. I don't want to fight anybody. I just want to
[910.18s -> 926.36s]  like take all the stuff in your camp. I don't want to fight you for it. I don't want to fight
[926.36s -> 936.60s]  you for any of this stuff. I just want it. I met you while lucid dreaming. We need the guy with
[936.60s -> 943.83s]  the green hat on. What the fuck, dude? What? We both were flying next to each other and I looked
[943.83s -> 949.19s]  over and you gave me the thumbs up and like, and I had the big airplane goggles on, like the big,
[949.43s -> 959.91s]  like the red Baron goggles on. That was so much fun. It sucks though, when I fucking,
[960.87s -> 966.47s]  like I stopped flapping my wings and I like froze in midplace and did a big cartoon gulp and fell.
[967.67s -> 970.47s]  You laughed at that, which is kind of fucking, that's kind of annoying,
[972.87s -> 984.52s]  but you know, it was still cool to see you though. I had a dream that you were over mine.
[993.35s -> 999.16s]  You're losing so many viewers. Um, I don't, I don't hear a thing. I don't think I'm,
[999.16s -> 1002.52s]  I don't think we're losing viewers. I think we're getting to the stage where a lot of people don't
[1002.52s -> 1010.12s]  want to see because a lot of people aren't necessarily grinding out this game. So the
[1010.12s -> 1014.60s]  further we go in Elden Ring, the further that people might not be and they might not want to see.
[1015.72s -> 1018.44s]  So that's the phenomenon you're experiencing here and that's cope.
[1019.56s -> 1032.84s]  That's streamer cope, but it's true. It's true. See, one person says that. You know how I know
[1032.84s -> 1037.00s]  that. Do you know why I know that's true? Because the first three or four days of Elden Ring,
[1037.00s -> 1043.00s]  I was watching tons of streamers. Oh my God, how'd they do with that guy? I have avoided every
[1043.00s -> 1051.94s]  single person's broadcast the last like four days. I've not looked at anybody, no one. So I mean that
[1052.87s -> 1058.66s]  ego kind of, kind of the way it is. All right, so I got to cross this bridge, but not yet.
[1059.46s -> 1066.66s]  And plus, I don't, not every stream has to have
[1067.38s -> 1088.98s]  20,000 people on it. I get it, man. I get it. These guys have so much health. He's gonna break
[1088.98s -> 1098.09s]  down because he's lost it. But I mean, I've only been live for fucking like 15 minutes. I don't,
[1098.09s -> 1110.18s]  I don't pay attention to that kind of stuff that much. Should I kill this thing? It has so much
[1110.18s -> 1119.75s]  health. Wait, how come this one doesn't have that much health? These vary in how much health they have.
[1119.75s -> 1128.82s]  Okay, so wait a minute. That one that was on the rooftop, I couldn't even hurt.
[1128.82s -> 1143.82s]  Is it just because they scaled to the area they're in? Yes. Frames dropping again? No,
[1143.82s -> 1157.75s]  they're not. Don't even say that. What? It can't be. Be serious. No. Hold on a minute. Let me,
[1157.75s -> 1186.18s]  let me do it. Let me do something real quick. Give me one second. I don't get it. My speed
[1186.18s -> 1204.63s]  tests are perfect. It couldn't get any better than this. It couldn't. What's going on? Yeah,
[1205.03s -> 1213.00s]  I was running a speed test. That's why I killed it. I don't think server matters. This is happening
[1213.00s -> 1231.54s]  to east coast streamers too. What? I did switch servers. I did. Yeah, I just ran a speed test and
[1232.50s -> 1246.66s]  it's perfect. Well, that's frustrating. Sorry guys. I wish there was something I could do about it.
[1248.90s -> 1257.27s]  I don't think it's a problem on my end. I don't. Yeah. Well, I'm sorry that we kind of have to
[1257.27s -> 1266.76s]  painfully deal with this because I changed servers. It doesn't seem to have fixed anything.
[1267.32s -> 1293.51s]  Well, we will press on. I got to go down there. Cross this bridge. It's not fine. It's not bad.
[1294.23s -> 1299.58s]  Yeah, that really does. It still sucks though because this is one of those games and one of
[1299.58s -> 1306.06s]  those streams where we're like kind of experiencing this and the harder it is to experience for some
[1306.06s -> 1314.25s]  of you guys, the more irritated it makes me. This is so new. It looks fine. It's probably going to
[1314.25s -> 1325.98s]  keep happening. Unfortunately, I don't think there's very much I could do about it. Let's just
[1325.98s -> 1338.98s]  kill this guy. Cause I'm probably my leveled up for this area. Probably it's all your fault.
[1343.61s -> 1355.43s]  I think stone. Yeah, we're in. Okay. So now I'm here. I was told that I would, I'd be very
[1355.43s -> 1360.28s]  interested in this area over here. And there's also something in the middle here too. All right. I
[1360.28s -> 1374.97s]  haven't seen any of this, so let's, let's take a, let's take a minute. Hey, I have a question. Is
[1374.97s -> 1384.50s]  the, is the tree in the middle? Is that why? Hold on. Is the tree just in the middle of every zone?
[1385.78s -> 1406.34s]  It is, right? I'll, I'll, I'll show you this gigantic tree. Am I still in combat?
[1407.45s -> 1420.39s]  Oh, like is, is, is this the tree here? Just huge in the middle. That would make sense.
[1420.95s -> 1435.40s]  All right, let's do it. This is the area I was told to come explore.
[1436.28s -> 1447.27s]  I said, Jerma, go check out this area. Somebody said you'd be very interested to see what's here.
[1447.99s -> 1465.72s]  Not actually this space, but you know, a little bit further. What a boat. Why don't you just get
[1465.72s -> 1476.07s]  out and walk? What's the point of being in a boat? You're that, that's harder to push. Who Tibia,
[1476.07s -> 1492.46s]  who Mar- who is this? Tibia Mariner? Where are you? Is this, is this the Mar- is this them right here?
[1493.26s -> 1504.60s]  Where are you? Where'd you go? Are you hiding? Oh, there you are.
[1505.16s -> 1518.92s]  You can't be that dangerous, right? Like I'm- is this person just actually in a boat?
[1519.64s -> 1528.41s]  This person like sucks. I, I think they got to like the boss sign up sheet.
[1529.53s -> 1535.51s]  And from software is just like, oh, all right, I guess we're going to add you. That's fine.
[1536.55s -> 1552.07s]  Where'd you go? All right, let's go kill this guy. Yeah. Okay. Uh, so you, you want to be a boss
[1552.07s -> 1559.19s]  in Elden Ring? Yes. What do you do, man? Ah, I have a boat. All right. Boat encounter. Sick. Cool.
[1559.19s -> 1563.11s]  Boat encounter, man. All right. So you're going to be like flying down like a speedboat. You're
[1563.11s -> 1573.77s]  going to have like a Kraken come up. Um, yeah. No way, bro. Seriously. Oh, wow. Yeah, absolutely.
[1573.77s -> 1581.61s]  So how much damage do you think you could do? Two. Two thousand? No fucking way, bro. Cool.
[1582.41s -> 1595.83s]  Get them on there quick. Get them on the list. This poor guy. This is just a regular enemy. He
[1595.83s -> 1604.26s]  wasn't supposed to be in the game. I feel so bad. I actually feel bad for that guy.
[1605.06s -> 1618.49s]  Death root. Skeletal militiaman ashes. Okay. Hey, don't even say anything else, man.
[1619.13s -> 1632.62s]  Welcome to Dark Souls. Welcome to Elden Ring, man. That actually is Pinwheel. That was, that was,
[1632.62s -> 1636.86s]  that was easier than Pinwheel. Even if I was, because I'm probably, what level am I? Level 60?
[1637.50s -> 1646.70s]  Yeah, I'm level 60. So if I was like level 45 or 50, I still think that would be impossible to lose.
[1650.65s -> 1654.01s]  That's not possible to lose. That guy literally was like the last minute sign-up.
[1654.73s -> 1678.49s]  Okay. Well, that was fun. Anything else here? That was cool. This guy in a fucking boat. Oh,
[1678.49s -> 1696.62s]  just die. I was level 16 when I did that. I got bone boys. I think is it only two or is it more
[1696.62s -> 1710.01s]  than two bone boys? Okay. I think there's a place to go down here. I think there's a dungeon here.
[1710.01s -> 1736.95s]  I would be surprised if there wasn't. By the way, I have to get intelligence to 52 if I plan on
[1736.95s -> 1744.92s]  using that staff. There's got to be a way to go down. All right. There's got to be.
[1749.77s -> 1772.06s]  Check over here one more time. This, that down here. I don't know. I don't see anything. Oh,
[1772.06s -> 1782.74s]  my back. Okay. I don't see any way to go down. Maybe it's here somewhere. I'll check one more
[1782.74s -> 1790.89s]  time this way. And that's it. All right. Somebody said next to the turtle. Are you sure? Are you,
[1790.89s -> 1805.51s]  are you, are you sure? Are you for real? I said what turtle? Turtle? Are you for real? Next to
[1805.51s -> 1814.25s]  the turtle. I don't remember where the turtle was. Where's the turtle? Is it a turtle? Ah,
[1814.25s -> 1818.30s]  fuck it. Whatever. I'll come back later. I don't know. I don't know what the turtle is.
[1830.42s -> 1841.26s]  I don't know what the turtle is. What about over there? Not over here. What about this one?
[1850.98s -> 1871.58s]  Thanks. I can't go down here. Why not? How do I get down there? It's a stone sword. Oh, it is.
[1871.58s -> 1875.34s]  Let's go. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. I got plenty of these.
[1876.41s -> 1890.47s]  Let's go. Let's go for it. I don't just, this dungeon is gonna get me kicked off the internet.
[1900.66s -> 1910.02s]  I don't have to fight these, right? Okay. Cause I like the turtle thing. Like everybody loves
[1910.02s -> 1913.46s]  the turtles in Elden Ring and like, I'm not just going to kill a room full of turtles.
[1915.06s -> 1930.31s]  Green turtle talisman. I got the turtle talisman. What's that? Oh, that's good. Raises stamina
[1930.31s -> 1940.33s]  recovery speed. Turtles are known as a nutritious ingredient symbolic of inexhaustible power.
[1941.05s -> 1957.46s]  So I just have permanent stamina recovery. So what's, is that better than slowly? How much HP does
[1957.46s -> 1972.66s]  this load? It's low HP and maybe get rid of this. That's the best talisman in the game. Well, that's
[1972.66s -> 1986.17s]  was worth, that was worth coming down here. Very cool. It's really slow, but it'll save you flasks.
[1988.66s -> 1999.61s]  Well, thank you. I appreciate that. Turtle friend. What a weird animal. What a weird animal. It's
[1999.61s -> 2009.37s]  like, it's like this weird, like almost like an elephant, but they have elephant feet and like
[2009.37s -> 2016.09s]  lizard heads and like big, like rock bodies. What a fucking weird animal. Like what an interest.
[2016.09s -> 2027.11s]  And they live to be like 150 years old. So strange. They have elephant feet. Yeah. Look at
[2027.11s -> 2038.46s]  there. Look at, look at this guy's elephant feet. He's got elephant feet. Cool. They're so slow,
[2038.46s -> 2053.00s]  but they're so wise. Did we just make that up by the way? Is this reason why like the turtle in
[2053.00s -> 2059.24s]  all TV shows and movies is old and has like a brow? Is it because they're old and we just like made
[2059.24s -> 2075.88s]  them, we just pretend they are? Oh, okay. Old equals wise. That's right. They live a long time.
[2075.88s -> 2081.98s]  Yeah. That's why we've made them like intelligent beings. We made them like super intelligent alien
[2081.98s -> 2086.73s]  beings. They live a long time, but that's cool though. That's cool to you that they can live
[2086.73s -> 2093.59s]  that long. All right. So now I want to go this way. That was not what I was told to go see.
[2094.23s -> 2101.40s]  I gotta keep going. Elephants are wise. Elephants are very intelligent, right? Elephants are very
[2101.40s -> 2112.49s]  wise, but I can't remember a piece of media, TV show, cartoon, movie, video game where an elephant
[2112.49s -> 2118.97s]  was, yes, it's me, the elephant, the old and wise elephant with like gray hairs here. How many,
[2118.97s -> 2133.29s]  how many gray haired tortoises have you seen? I think I gotta go this way. It's turtles and
[2133.29s -> 2140.20s]  owls. No, the ninja turtles don't count. They got covered in ooze. That doesn't count.
[2147.99s -> 2150.79s]  They could, any animal could have been in that ooze and they would have become,
[2151.43s -> 2161.08s]  you know, that. It could have been like the ninja seahorses if they, if they'd gone in that goo. So
[2161.08s -> 2173.18s]  that doesn't count. Okay. Where is it? This is, there's apparently a cave here somewhere. I was
[2173.18s -> 2184.09s]  told explicitly to come here. How come they chose turtles for that show? They just kind of did,
[2184.09s -> 2197.48s]  didn't they? That's up further, but up there, those turtles are cool. Turtles are cool.
[2198.12s -> 2211.94s]  They should have just used people, but that would just be teenage mutant ninjas, teenage mutant
[2211.94s -> 2232.81s]  ninjas, heroes, teenagers. How would you even do that? Okay. I think this is right. What do I
[2232.81s -> 2245.86s]  have against turtles? I just told you that I thought turtles were cool animal. Can you swing
[2245.86s -> 2253.08s]  at them please? Oh my goodness. Really? Are you that bad? I just said that I thought turtles were
[2253.08s -> 2276.74s]  cool. All right. So what's here? What is it? There's something right here. What is it? Ah,
[2278.26s -> 2283.38s]  do you not think snakes are cool? I think snakes are cool that they just scare me.
[2285.26s -> 2293.02s]  Oh, all right. Okay. Cool. Let's go. Snakes kind of scare the shit out of me. Not because,
[2293.02s -> 2297.82s]  and I honestly, I don't, I'm not afraid of snakes. I'm afraid of snakes unpredictability.
[2299.58s -> 2311.74s]  Snakes are unpredictable. I have this fear of, okay, snake is just like, oh, you want to hold
[2311.74s -> 2317.26s]  the snake? Yeah, sure. And they're just kind of, it's wrapping around my arm and looking at me and
[2317.26s -> 2324.94s]  going, it's like, oh, hey, hey, hey, little guy, like licking and like, kind of looks cute. And
[2324.94s -> 2334.26s]  then I move like a way that they don't like any, and I'm like, and I start to fucking pass out and
[2334.26s -> 2339.56s]  shit. Like, I don't know if they freak me out. I just feel like they're unpredictable. Like you
[2339.56s -> 2345.45s]  can't determine like what the move is that they're not going to like. So like, if you have a snake
[2345.45s -> 2351.51s]  in front of you and you turn your eyes a certain way, I don't like that. I don't like what you just
[2351.51s -> 2361.34s]  did. And like they hear it fucking strike. I don't know. They don't, they're unpredictable.
[2361.34s -> 2369.35s]  What about children are unpredictable too? Yes, a child is unpredictable. But the difference is
[2369.99s -> 2376.23s]  watching like a two year old like bounce around walking and like bump into a wall is not the same
[2376.23s -> 2381.83s]  as a snake biting you in the neck. It's different. A toddler is not going to come up to you and look
[2381.83s -> 2390.38s]  at you and be like, what is it a little Johnny? What do you want? And just like fucking leech,
[2390.38s -> 2403.53s]  like leap at you and like fucking strike you right here. How am I supposed to get down there?
[2403.53s -> 2411.27s]  Horses are unpredictable too. I'm just saying, and I'm saying a lot, there's no poisonous horses.
[2412.07s -> 2419.48s]  Look, if a snake, if there was snakes that just bit you and that was it, it's like, fuck, I got a
[2419.48s -> 2424.04s]  snake bite. A shitload of snakes can literally kill you. They can, but there's not a poisonous
[2424.04s -> 2431.30s]  horse. Although if a horse like fucking kicks you in the face, it's going to cave in your face.
[2432.34s -> 2437.22s]  Okay, that argument's not that sound. But you understand what I mean though? Like a snake can
[2437.22s -> 2444.42s]  hide. A snake can hide somewhere in like a bush. I know that at the danger level of a horse,
[2444.42s -> 2449.85s]  if you get, you know, kicked, bucked in the face, it's going to blow up your whole face and you're
[2449.85s -> 2454.81s]  going to die instantly. But like I can see the horse, I can run from the horse, right? I can see
[2454.81s -> 2460.97s]  the horse from a mile away. A snake just like in a bush is like, where is he? I don't know. He's
[2460.97s -> 2464.65s]  somewhere near me. And then they get off and they're like this and they go like that. And
[2465.05s -> 2470.15s]  they like fucking fray out their heads. And then it's like, okay, if I move, I'm dead.
[2470.15s -> 2483.74s]  It's unpredictable. Guys, like tigers are like that too. Sometimes like a tiger or a lion will
[2483.74s -> 2491.35s]  just be like, oh, like, it's just like, whoa, whoa, what happened? What happened? What's going on?
[2492.31s -> 2496.55s]  What's going on? Why'd they freak out? Like sometimes they just freak out. Sometimes animals
[2496.55s -> 2504.30s]  like just freak out. Snakes. Tigers are like, no, I don't like unpredictable animals. I like
[2504.30s -> 2508.70s]  predictable animals. Like a, like a fucking little like sausage dog because they're just going to
[2508.70s -> 2513.42s]  lie on the couch and they're not going to like, there's no point where Otto is going to like
[2513.42s -> 2518.46s]  roll over. I'm going to be rubbing his stomach and he's going to go like, oh yeah. And like,
[2518.46s -> 2536.90s]  come and fucking kill me. Like it's not going to happen. Oh, the title of the stream. Do you
[2536.90s -> 2543.30s]  live in a rainforest? No, I don't live in a rainforest. I'm just saying I'm comfortable.
[2543.30s -> 2546.50s]  I'm not comfortable around certain animals as much as I think they're cool. I think snakes are
[2546.50s -> 2553.14s]  really cool animals. I just don't want to hold one. And I know that, oh, but Mr. Snookums,
[2553.14s -> 2558.90s]  my snake is so cool. I, that's fine. I don't care. Hold them. I'll watch. I'll take a fucking picture
[2560.33s -> 2564.65s]  like big tarantula spiders. No, I don't want to hold you tarantula. I don't get it. That's
[2564.65s -> 2578.33s]  I want to be within like three or four counties away from that thing. Your neck is all red. I'm
[2578.33s -> 2585.69s]  telling you. That's what I'm saying. I get bit by a snake. Have you ever seen a wild tarantula?
[2587.82s -> 2592.46s]  Look, we're not talking about in the wild. We're talking about like people that have pets.
[2592.46s -> 2597.18s]  There's a ton of people that have tarantula pets. A ton of people have snakes for pets.
[2597.18s -> 2601.18s]  I'm glad you like it. I hope you enjoy it. I know they're probably so loving and so wonderful.
[2601.82s -> 2605.26s]  I don't want it near me. I don't want to be near it. I just want to look. I'll look at it
[2605.26s -> 2624.18s]  from like a distance. Okay. I need to level up. And those little ball pythons, they're so cute
[2624.18s -> 2628.18s]  and they're so nice and they're so fun and they'll just kind of sit and hang out with you.
[2628.98s -> 2634.34s]  That one moment, one moment in my brain where like I did something unpredictable to the snake
[2635.70s -> 2646.62s]  and he latches on. Don't let go. You can put it on a leash. You don't put a leash on a snake.
[2647.34s -> 2672.10s]  What are you talking about? Oh, I can do it now. All right. Let me uh, okay. This that way. Okay.
[2672.66s -> 2684.49s]  Object permanence time. Object permanence time. Down, right, left. Got it. Okay. You go right.
[2684.49s -> 2719.38s]  1100 damage. Holy crap. Okay. This leads into this waterfall area. Do that once.
[2722.07s -> 2753.91s]  Okay. This is a tiny little area to fight this. What? I don't have any juice left.
[2755.32s -> 2769.21s]  Bad timing. I gotta get around him. Here we go. It's not doing enough damage to remotely even
[2769.21s -> 2805.69s]  considered using. Oh man. He's susceptible to that for sure. Behind you. What? Still alive?
[2805.69s -> 2827.37s]  You were very susceptible to that. Land octopus ovary. Cross naginata causes blood loss. Dex C.
[2828.25s -> 2844.36s]  This thing looks crazy. Oh, it's a spear. That's cool. It's a spider behind you.
[2849.42s -> 2867.50s]  Oh, got him. Damn it. My room is too clean. I was hoping I could put like a piece of like
[2867.50s -> 2871.18s]  brown or like black dust or something in my hand and be like, oh yeah, and show it.
[2872.89s -> 2876.41s]  Well, I thought that was going to be like a piece, like a little piece of something like I could put
[2876.41s -> 2884.10s]  in my hand. Why do you look AI generated? I don't know because I'm ugly. Okay. Why don't you just
[2884.10s -> 2910.15s]  say what you want to say? Ooh. Okay. So that's, there's nothing here. You won't acknowledge his
[2912.31s -> 2915.19s]  dude. I was literally pretending to bite my neck with a snake.
[2916.07s -> 2923.96s]  Can you imagine if I just showed up on stream one day and they were just like,
[2929.27s -> 2949.86s]  I just don't say anything. I need 20,000. I'm, I'm putting it into health. Don't worry.
[2949.86s -> 2963.50s]  Just be covered in boils for your next stream. No, I, that would be, that would be concerning.
[2963.50s -> 2970.23s]  Could be like, what the hell's happening? Is he okay? If I just have like boils everywhere,
[2970.23s -> 2973.27s]  like big bubbles, like I got, I went to a prosthetic makeup person or something and had
[2973.27s -> 2980.07s]  him all over me. You guys would be like, what's, what happened? I would actually scare the shit
[2980.07s -> 2984.15s]  out of people. And if I didn't make a joke about it or something, I feel like people would not be
[2984.15s -> 2994.20s]  happy about that. It'd be like, dude, come on. Like, what the fuck? Just draw a bunch more zits.
[2995.24s -> 3004.82s]  You just say you're allergic to something. Yeah. Sorry guys. I changed laundry detergents.
[3009.08s -> 3016.62s]  That's actually kind of funny. Yeah. Sorry guys. I, I, I'm using a new brand of detergent and
[3017.34s -> 3025.03s]  I think it's my blanket. I don't know. Had a big reaction to it because that is everything down
[3025.03s -> 3040.15s]  there. I have enough to level up. I think let's just do it. Where was that? I want that spear.
[3040.15s -> 3049.94s]  I'll show you in just a sec. Uh, that spear is behind the big optic octopus in the Gale tunnel,
[3049.94s -> 3054.50s]  which is in this weird section down over the off the road here between, uh,
[3055.99s -> 3061.43s]  Kalid and limb grave come down this way. There's a cave down here. There's some
[3061.43s -> 3072.47s]  enemies down here as well. You're looking for that, uh, pretty good weapon. It looks kind of cool.
[3073.11s -> 3083.88s]  I'll have to check it out. I'll try it on. I need one more kill should do it. And then I'm
[3083.88s -> 3101.99s]  going to put it into health. How big is your spear? Um, well, this is a, this is a short sword. So
[3103.03s -> 3107.67s]  it's like, maybe, well, I was using a dagger before, so three, four inches.
[3108.39s -> 3115.77s]  You talk about like the blade, like from the blade to the, uh, handle. That's a lot. That's
[3115.77s -> 3120.87s]  what I was using. It was a dagger. Oh, what? Oh my God. What the heck happened? I said something
[3120.87s -> 3140.01s]  weird and gross. All right, let's keep going. No reason to fight any of you.
[3144.31s -> 3153.88s]  I would get banned from my own chat. We'll just be clear. I would get banned from my own chat.
[3153.88s -> 3185.22s]  Like I would actually get banned from my own chat. Hey, race mimic. What is that? Oh,
[3185.22s -> 3189.30s]  it's the thing where you break it and it kills. It gets rid of all your souls and puts you to a
[3189.30s -> 3204.95s]  bonfire. Five of them. That was down here. That's it. Oh, hold on. This is, this is
[3206.07s -> 3236.22s]  smithing stone. There's something big behind here. Okay. Is there a bonfire right here?
[3236.22s -> 3243.82s]  Cause that thing is, whatever that is, it's big. This guy died at pinwheel. Yes, of course. I'm
[3243.82s -> 3255.59s]  glad I didn't just open that door. Did you play destiny too? If there was sex scenes? No,
[3256.47s -> 3269.13s]  who cares? It's down here. This is the other entrance. Uh, I have way too many flasks
[3269.13s -> 3279.67s]  been acting up lately. Like this chest thing. Let's do, uh, I'll do seven and two.
[3280.39s -> 3305.10s]  All right. Who's in here? Go headphones. Magma worm. Didn't I already fight this guy?
[3305.98s -> 3319.50s]  All right. Oh no. I thought the magma worm maker. So this guy is made by the big magma worm guy.
[3319.50s -> 3362.92s]  Okay. Well I have experience fighting you, but glint stones. What am I doing? I'm not, I'm not,
[3362.92s -> 3398.65s]  I'm not like at Disney world. Like what am I doing? Oh, now does he stand up like his friend?
[3399.29s -> 3417.91s]  Stop doing that move. Stop doing the move. This tiny little area. Stop doing that move. Stop
[3417.91s -> 3424.63s]  doing that move. Okay. Like dude, you guys gonna run a circle? It's a tiny circle.
[3425.35s -> 3441.82s]  I got it. I got it. Not all these magma worms. They're magma worm maker. He makes the magma
[3441.82s -> 3451.70s]  worms. He's like, he's like the chocolate factory guy. He died to the magma worm at level 60.
[3452.26s -> 3461.08s]  Did your magma worm do three or four magma runs in a row? I didn't think so. So who?
[3462.04s -> 3478.49s]  Okay. Object permanence. Where are we going? Wrong way. Can I summon Oleg in there? But Oleg
[3478.49s -> 3521.18s]  kind of sucks against these guys. I actually would rather have the boys. Oh, the boys are dead.
[3530.62s -> 3567.80s]  Oh, he spins all the way around. Let that fire dissipate. Dude, I got a river of flame here.
[3588.46s -> 3668.01s]  Oh, you stand up. Do you stand up like your friend does? He does stand up. I don't think he stands
[3668.01s -> 3685.78s]  up. That's the difference. It's annoying. It has a lot of health. What the fuck? Oh, what the fuck?
[3686.34s -> 3802.95s]  What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck? Hey, I dodged it.
[3802.95s -> 3824.65s]  I didn't. Oh, another dragon heart and I got nothing called moon veil. Moon veil.
[3843.93s -> 3872.87s]  Int and deck scaling katana. Really? Wow. It has a magic slash. Shit, this thing's fucking crazy.
[3872.87s -> 3887.26s]  Chief blade holding it at the hip in a composed stance. Follow up with either a normal or a strong
[3887.26s -> 3899.32s]  attack to draw the blade at great speed. Both attacks fire a wave of light. Oh, my whole body
[3899.32s -> 3919.61s]  just like got like cold. What does it take to level up? It's fast. It's fast as fuck too.
[3920.25s -> 3934.12s]  That's a huge one. I wonder how much damage that does. How much man does it take? That goes far
[3934.12s -> 3939.48s]  and look at that's a huge wave. That doesn't take very much mana. I wonder how much it does.
[3939.48s -> 3954.39s]  And it has bleed. Are you kidding me? It's a magic bleed weapon. This is the best int weapon in the
[3954.39s -> 3976.39s]  game. What the fuck? It hits like a truck. All right, dude. Okay, for now, let's I got to put up
[3977.03s -> 3984.65s]  but the carrion knight sword has been passed down for generations. The carrion knight blade is like
[3984.65s -> 3997.90s]  so it's a regal and look at it's both best in the game. Yeah, I know that's subjective. Well,
[3997.90s -> 4004.14s]  I need to go investigate that because if that's the case, if that's the case, then I might have
[4004.14s -> 4007.58s]  to actually use it. I need to see how much damage that magic part of it does though.
[4008.46s -> 4023.34s]  Well, that's really cool. Passed down for generations. Well, I mean, I yeah, this wasn't
[4023.34s -> 4032.04s]  passed down to me. I took it off of some guy. Oh, passed down for generations. I like I kind of
[4032.04s -> 4048.20s]  just took this off a guy's body. Oh, do I really? Am I that attached? Okay, let's do a little I need
[4048.20s -> 4051.88s]  to do an investigative work here. I it's not going to do that much damage that I don't have enough to
[4051.88s -> 4066.09s]  I need one point in strength. But how much damage does that do? 173. How big is the arc?
[4075.05s -> 4086.89s]  That's a big arc. He's serious, dude. I can't even I'm not like that. I'm legally not even
[4086.89s -> 4091.91s]  allowed to have this like on right now. And I'm still like, all right, no, no more testing.
[4103.35s -> 4114.79s]  I don't know. I don't know. You're too handing it so you get the benefits. Okay, okay.
[4121.13s -> 4130.62s]  Cool weld. It looks cool. It is cool. It's like a like a see through. It's like bubbles.
[4132.38s -> 4138.47s]  It's like styrofoam. I have a styrofoam sword. This is kind of weird. It's just styrofoam.
[4138.47s -> 4154.15s]  Am I sure this is actually hurting people? Do not use it. All right, let me I want to see what it
[4154.15s -> 4159.21s]  what it takes to upgrade. Because I can have a couple weapons, right? But let me all right,
[4159.21s -> 4180.82s]  let me clear this from I did that there. Bro, watch out. There's a snake. Good kidding. See
[4180.90s -> 4187.38s]  through brain Andy. Let me clear that. And then all right, do I go back to the Smith?
[4187.94s -> 4194.09s]  Is there anything else over here that I marked? I don't think so. No. I just had a panic attack
[4194.09s -> 4200.98s]  for one second. I actually thought I actually thought that I was going here. I was like, oh,
[4200.98s -> 4208.50s]  I have to go fight that guy on the radan guy. I beat him. Thank God. All right. What was next
[4208.50s -> 4216.66s]  on the list of like my cleanup list? Here, I wanted to see what this was. So we're gonna go
[4216.66s -> 4228.54s]  there. Yeah, I did. I fight I fight it over Dan. And he he wouldn't take me about three or four
[4228.54s -> 4241.43s]  hours to beat him. planning all the way. hating the game the whole way. So this way, I get up.
[4243.16s -> 4250.23s]  Oh, no, nevermind. I don't Is there even a way to get up there? It doesn't look like it. I don't
[4250.23s -> 4256.98s]  think I can get there from here. If you have to go from here. Whatever. Okay. Alright, nevermind.
[4257.62s -> 4262.41s]  Where's three? Three was this I was like, what's this thing? This is kind of weird thing. What's
[4262.41s -> 4293.42s]  that? Let's go find out. You please play Lego GTA. Stupid game. Finish Ronnie's quest. Yeah,
[4293.42s -> 4299.26s]  after I clean up these waypoints, I'm going to go to the Smith. I'm going to see what I have
[4299.26s -> 4306.70s]  available and see if I want to potentially upgrade that katana. I also need 12 strength.
[4308.90s -> 4319.51s]  I don't know. I'm not sure yet. It's definitely available. Alright, so what is here? Play Lego
[4319.51s -> 4335.77s]  elven room. Let's explore this island. frames are still dropping. Yeah, they are and they're
[4335.77s -> 4342.01s]  going to continue to. It's some something going on with the twitch servers right now.
[4342.65s -> 4363.16s]  I've confirmed it is not my internet. This seek three wise beasts. Tetsu's rise. You must solve
[4363.16s -> 4374.73s]  the puzzle to enter. Seek three wise beasts. Oh, we're just never doing this one.
[4376.01s -> 4417.10s]  Kill three turtles. Oh my god, the whole island is here. God, get off me. How many people are
[4417.10s -> 4429.16s]  just gonna spawn here? I mean, I'll take the souls. There's not stop. Let's farm here for a minute.
[4429.16s -> 4455.61s]  Why not? So I'm just gonna farm here. What? Oh, I thought I had the sword out. Oh my god,
[4456.09s -> 4461.93s]  what? They're not giving you any souls. Are they not 65? That's a lot. That's not bad.
[4463.45s -> 4467.38s]  That's not bad. Then actually, it's not that. Yeah, you're right. Let's get out of here.
[4468.18s -> 4488.15s]  All right. Well, I can't do whatever this is, but I can check the back. I don't think I can do this
[4488.15s -> 4500.60s]  yet. Oh, okay. Well, that's cool. Magic turtle. Find three wise beasts. That's a turtle right
[4500.60s -> 4514.18s]  there. What do I do? Is that it? It's definitely fine. Three wise beasts. It's actually turtle.
[4514.18s -> 4519.30s]  It actually is, isn't it? You gotta be kidding me. After all the shit that we just talked, is it?
[4523.99s -> 4529.11s]  Oh, that was kind of mean. That's what it is. Oh my god, it's actually that.
[4530.33s -> 4538.63s]  Let's kill the three wise beasts. It's the turtles. And then that's gonna open. All right,
[4538.63s -> 4553.42s]  where's the other turtles? That was one. They're just hiding in random trees or something.
[4561.99s -> 4600.06s]  Come on. Where are you? I know there's more. Two? Where's three? Everybody see three?
[4612.09s -> 4630.82s]  I don't know. Other side? It's gotta be here. Like right here somewhere. Where's this third
[4630.82s -> 4675.66s]  turtle? On the beach maybe? Over in the rocks. Where the hell are you? I don't know. Behind you.
[4681.42s -> 4736.81s]  There's one more turtle. I need to find it. Oh shit! Do I have to get them again? I just reset it.
[4736.81s -> 4744.20s]  Wait, okay. Where the fuck were they? Where were they? Where were they? I don't remember.
[4744.20s -> 4787.70s]  Object permanency. Where is this last turtle? Look over the east cliff. Thank you. Thank you.
[4787.70s -> 4797.02s]  I don't- I'm not playing where's Waldo for like another fucking five minutes. East cliff? This is
[4797.02s -> 4810.49s]  the east cliff right here. I swear to god damn god man. Just teleport quick before I fall off.
[4811.37s -> 4826.18s]  I have to start the puzzle again? I'm just gonna sprint as fast as I can.
[4828.09s -> 4832.01s]  Oh, it's because I have to activate it. Right. Okay, because all those guys didn't spawn.
[4832.73s -> 4838.89s]  Seek three wise beasts. Okay, where are they?
[4843.45s -> 4846.60s]  I'm just waiting for one of them to go.
[4850.44s -> 4855.64s]  Oh, I'm awake. They always sleep and they always wake up and have a white beard. Where are they?
[4871.61s -> 4886.34s]  Oh, there's the dog mouth too. It's like- all right, let me at least get the other ones.
[4886.34s -> 4890.02s]  Where's this last one? This last one's gonna be like a suction cup down a wall. I know it.
[4890.02s -> 4899.90s]  It's gonna be so stupid. Are you sure that they are- I reset it because I don't see the one in
[4899.90s -> 4942.57s]  the tree anymore. He's in a bush next to the stairs. You lying motherfucker. There's no turtle
[4942.57s -> 4951.85s]  in this bush dude. East- it's off the side of a cliff. Southwest cliff. Southwest cliff. Southwest
[4951.85s -> 4970.20s]  cliff. Southwest cliff. Oh my goodness gracious. I have a confession to make. I thought that was a
[4970.20s -> 4975.56s]  sickle on the compass and I was wondering what the hell that was the whole game. It's S.
[4984.73s -> 4993.98s]  Southwest cliff. I thought that was like a sickle and it was like oh this is some kind of a sickle
[4993.98s -> 4997.98s]  enemy or a sickle thing. They're like- I don't know what it was. That doesn't look like an S.
[4999.99s -> 5003.27s]  Okay, southwest cliff. This is southwest. Here's the cliff.
[5004.89s -> 5030.81s]  Right? This southwestern cliff. I hear magical sounds near the edge. I'm just gonna look up from
[5030.81s -> 5043.08s]  here. Stop throwing. I'm looking for a turtle that is randomly in a spot here and I can't find this
[5043.08s -> 5051.58s]  little bastard, okay? Southwest cliff. Why am I still in combat? I can't even look at my fucking
[5051.58s -> 5091.59s]  map. Wrong side. This is the southwestern- look at the compass! It's just- where the fuck is this
[5091.59s -> 5115.19s]  thing? It's not on a cliff. Look at the map. I know- I know- people- I feel like people are
[5115.19s -> 5124.52s]  fucking baiting me. I need to- I'm gonna circle the whole goddamn island. I'm not- dude, southwest
[5124.52s -> 5136.87s]  cliff! Yeah, last time I did that I fell off the edge. This- I am at the southwest part of the map
[5136.87s -> 5171.45s]  right now. I don't see a turtle. Like, you mean out here? He just looked at it? Flying above you.
[5171.45s -> 5194.79s]  No, it is not. It's not a blimp. It's a turtle. Go on the cliff. I am at sea level right- I'm not
[5194.79s -> 5204.95s]  supposed to be yelling. I'm currently at sea level right now. South cliff. Look down. There's no cliff
[5205.03s -> 5210.31s]  on the southwestern part. South cliff. Look down. I'm gonna listen to that person.
[5226.76s -> 5229.80s]  There's no southern cliff. It all leads down to sea level.
[5232.54s -> 5249.85s]  Where are you? Where are you? Dude, it was right there. Right side of the tower. Run along the edge.
[5252.07s -> 5259.78s]  The edge of the tower or the edge of the map? Like, the cliff. Oh my god, it is stupid motherfucker.
[5280.90s -> 5301.54s]  I thought- I thought he was gonna be like- like, suctioned on the edge. Okay, I get it. What's in
[5301.54s -> 5311.26s]  here? This is very intriguing. Very intriguing. Seek three wise beasts. I can't believe it was
[5311.26s -> 5330.12s]  wise beasts. We just had a whole rant about that. Okay, so what the hell's here? Do you think- oh,
[5330.12s -> 5333.56s]  question mark, question mark. Do you think turtles have suction powers? LOL, what an idiot.
[5334.78s -> 5343.96s]  One of them was in a fucking tree. I don't know very many tortoises that can climb trees
[5343.96s -> 5362.39s]  and get to the top of the fucking tree. Is that for your logic? Oh, wait. Oh, hold on. Can I get
[5362.39s -> 5375.74s]  over there? Oh, look at this. Oh, look what's over here. Really? Come on. Is there something I can
[5375.74s -> 5389.69s]  do about this? Where's the shot? Wait, illusory wall. Don't tell him what to do. Let him lose on
[5389.69s -> 5402.41s]  his own. Okay, fine. That's interesting. Gonna be a teleporter. Oh, another spell- another memory
[5402.41s -> 5409.67s]  stone. That's it? That's kind of cool. That's kind of cool. It's a little puzzle to get a memory
[5409.67s -> 5427.38s]  stone. This is definitely a place where online messages make a big difference, yeah. Lugades
[5427.38s -> 5434.10s]  is probably the hardest boss in the game. Oh, I hear- yeah, yeah. General Lugades. That guy's nuts.
[5435.06s -> 5449.43s]  Crazy. That's a crazy fight. Okay, so that's cool. As I did want to check that out, I wanted to
[5450.23s -> 5455.83s]  see what that was. I also wanted to see what this was before we continue on our on our main
[5455.83s -> 5473.18s]  quest here. Very curious what that boulder thing is. Very curious about it. Are we in the end game
[5473.18s -> 5483.27s]  now? No, I don't think we'll be in the end game for quite a while. All right, what is this big boulder?
[5490.12s -> 5518.23s]  Royal Grave Evergale. Go to Evergale. Yes. Okay. Alabaster Lord? What did this guy come from?
[5526.02s -> 5533.53s]  Oh, shit. That's all right. All right. All right. All right. All right, Mr. Lord.
[5538.38s -> 5562.60s]  Not bad. I got magic of my own. See how it works against you. That was- that staggered him too.
[5562.60s -> 5574.34s]  Hold on. Get a better one. That not even hurt me. That did. All right, now we're fucking around.
[5574.90s -> 5613.69s]  No more testing. No more theories. Let's go to phase two. Okay, so that doesn't do damage,
[5613.69s -> 5625.35s]  but just knocks you down. Oh, okay. He kind of reversed a long way. Oh, boy. This bad.
[5626.31s -> 5683.13s]  All right. That wasn't that bad. Alabaster Lord. Meteorite. Cool. That's just- that's just a boss.
[5683.13s -> 5692.09s]  It's just like a phantom boss thing. Let me see what that looks like. I can use this now. 30 in.
[5692.97s -> 5698.17s]  All small meteorites down from the sky. Someone's avoid that in his reign of small meteorites hold
[5698.17s -> 5705.05s]  to continue the effect. I definitely want to try it. I've- wait, you haven't done any- I've not done-
[5705.05s -> 5711.48s]  that's- I didn't even know they existed. How many more of these are there? Is that the first Evergale
[5711.48s -> 5722.06s]  he's seen? Yeah. There's a lot of these? There are dozens of these. Okay, let me ask a question. I
[5722.06s -> 5728.22s]  have a question for everybody watching. Did I, like- because I spent a lot of time exploring
[5728.22s -> 5735.70s]  in the first stream or two, did I just go the route to avoid every single possible interesting
[5735.70s -> 5746.90s]  thing? Did that- how did I miss everything? I did so much exploring. I did, like, I did a bunch of
[5746.90s -> 5752.98s]  dungeons and, like, I looked down here, the burnt ruins. I didn't find any of this stuff. It was a
[5752.98s -> 5758.92s]  required item that I was supposed to find. I just didn't even know it existed until, like, literally
[5758.92s -> 5776.63s]  fucking 12 hours ago. You can fight these? Okay. Well, that's cool. You explored armpits when the
[5776.63s -> 5782.47s]  full body was exposed. That's, like, weird. That was a weird thing. I don't even know what I said.
[5782.47s -> 5786.23s]  That was a weird thing to say. That was a very weird thing to say. I don't even know what you're
[5786.23s -> 5790.87s]  saying. That was weird. That was a very odd way to put that and, like, I don't know. It's freaking me
[5790.87s -> 5798.84s]  out. You explored the armpit when the whole body was exposed. What's that supposed to mean?
[5799.72s -> 5803.98s]  What's that supposed to mean? That's freaking me out. I don't know what that means.
[5804.62s -> 5809.00s]  Did you expect a serious answer? Yes. I know this is a very serious community.
[5810.63s -> 5818.92s]  Okay. Pretty cool. I think I've tied up all the loose ends. There's one more loose end that I
[5818.92s -> 5822.44s]  want to tie up and I just want to get the map fragment for here because it's, like, come on.
[5823.08s -> 5834.87s]  Really? Try the meteor? Yeah. Yeah. You want to try the meteor? Okay. I'll try it. Sure. Okay.
[5834.87s -> 5861.18s]  Let's see what it does. It shoots me in random directions?
[5865.27s -> 5870.31s]  This is fucking terrible. Hold on. Does it? If I lock on, will it? Let's test it over here.
[5871.03s -> 5888.22s]  I wonder if I lock on. All right. Let's see what happens here. That might be the worst move in the
[5888.22s -> 5914.58s]  game. I didn't hit any single person. It's probably good against big enemies. I guess maybe if you cast
[5914.58s -> 5930.65s]  right in front of them maybe. That's a lot. I thought it was a different spell. I thought it
[5930.65s -> 5937.43s]  was one that, like, shot little ones. It says small meteors. Those are huge. Okay. Well,
[5937.43s -> 5942.87s]  it's not very good, but maybe it'll be good in random scenarios. I need... I'm going to get to
[5942.87s -> 5961.85s]  25 vigor. Do I have enough... So what? What? Oh, wait. I got a new great rune. What does Rodan's
[5961.85s -> 5967.96s]  great rune do? The void of any benediction. Seek the divine tower of Kaelid, which stands upon the...
[5968.68s -> 5973.58s]  I think I have to talk to the finger lady. Yeah. Let's go talk to the finger lady. Upgrade strength.
[5976.34s -> 5983.19s]  Wait. Do what I came here for. I could, yeah, I could go to the dragon thing.
[5983.83s -> 5998.04s]  But those are all faith moves. And Rodan's soul weapons. Yeah. Let me get the map fragment.
[5998.04s -> 6013.32s]  Should do the katana. I'm going to make a very, very hard decision. I'm going to make a decision.
[6013.32s -> 6038.46s]  Not going to be easy. Lunaria East. Finally, I can see what the hell's going on here. I wonder
[6038.46s -> 6047.82s]  how much further up this goes. You know what I mean, Vern? All right. Time to head back to the
[6047.82s -> 6074.98s]  blacksmith and make some decisions. This is not going to be easy. I don't have enough to level up
[6074.98s -> 6084.84s]  one time, but I could get it pretty easily. I also need to... Let me do this while I'm here as well.
[6085.00s -> 6089.21s]  Greetings. Are you here for spirits? There's something you should know.
[6089.21s -> 6094.41s]  I need to warn you about something. A little while ago, someone started lurking in the wing
[6094.41s -> 6100.41s]  on the opposite side of the round table. And I can hear, from all the way over there,
[6100.41s -> 6109.26s]  a thing of spirits in fear of a curse. I can even hear the repulsive twisted malice in itself.
[6109.26s -> 6114.46s]  A plethora of spirits in an unceasing cacophony. I can't even imagine
[6114.94s -> 6121.50s]  how much suffering inflicted to who knows how many souls. Not even the crafting caused anything
[6121.50s -> 6126.46s]  like this to happen. You should keep your distance. I know you're strong, but please.
[6126.46s -> 6134.63s]  Wait, what? There's like a boss in here? This little one.
[6139.02s -> 6140.14s]  But you want to give me a little friend?
[6140.14s -> 6142.70s]  I'll be glad if you'll come to me, I think.
[6142.70s -> 6161.21s]  Favorite jellyfish. All right, let's get the boys up. I need Ghost Glovewort II to even do Oleg.
[6162.17s -> 6184.82s]  Boys love free. I'll do the wolves as well. Level the boys up, yeah. I'm curious what
[6184.82s -> 6192.62s]  she's talking about. I'm gonna go take a look. All right, so...
[6192.62s -> 6204.06s]  So, somber smithing stone 6 is what I need to get this to plus 6. I also need to start
[6204.70s -> 6211.66s]  upgrading. I gotta get this upgraded. My scaling is such shit. What does it take to get Katana
[6211.66s -> 6251.88s]  upgraded? Also, somber smithing stone. That's C scaling, C and C. All right, all right, all right,
[6251.88s -> 6273.62s]  hold on. This is 150, 150 plus 29, 38. The scaling is so much higher. And with the strength,
[6273.62s -> 6285.50s]  it would be, it'll be fine. What does more? 137 plus 62 plus the bleed. Yeah, I'm gonna put a
[6285.50s -> 6291.58s]  point in strength. It's, yeah. It's time to put the, uh, carrion knight sword to rest, because that's
[6291.58s -> 6303.16s]  D and D scaling. This is C and C scaling. It's like, well, is this a no-brainer? That's a
[6303.16s -> 6315.43s]  no-brainer. I'm gonna miss this little guy, but this thing just seems way too good. All right,
[6315.43s -> 6325.86s]  I just need a point in strength. And I'm also going to do this too, because where's that staff
[6325.86s -> 6336.89s]  that I want to eventually use? It's here. Okay, somber smithing stone. I can do it again. Get this
[6336.89s -> 6348.55s]  to plus four, which I'm going to do. I want to equip, it's almost an S scaling, bro. My current
[6348.55s -> 6353.19s]  staff does not use somber smithing stones, so I'm just going to use the regular ones on here.
[6353.83s -> 6381.54s]  So I need, I need six. Uh, bro. Okay, now I've got to, what do I gotta do? What was I gonna do?
[6382.34s -> 6388.23s]  What the hell am I doing? There's something very specific I wanted to do.
[6389.53s -> 6398.02s]  What was it? Oh, the, uh, the boss soul and the finger lady. Go find out what the deal is.
[6398.82s -> 6416.26s]  All right, what's the radan boss soul? Cause I'll just crush it. Okay. This is just a huge strength
[6416.26s -> 6425.30s]  weapon and a bow though. That's kind of cool. I am great bow. Star color cry. Bring the,
[6425.30s -> 6438.28s]  wait, it's two swords. You pull people, you pull them in. The great bro is pretty pog.
[6439.08s -> 6446.73s]  Radan's rain. Archery skill performed from a low stance. Oh, it shoots. It does the arrow move.
[6448.28s -> 6460.02s]  Sucks. Okay. Uh, I'm just going to crush it for souls. That's really cool though.
[6460.02s -> 6471.03s]  Oh, don't what? Let me don't. Why is everybody going? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't, don't,
[6471.03s -> 6488.39s]  don't. Why not? Wait, what are his namesake? I'm not by the finger reader. Yeah. Or used to gain
[6488.39s -> 6498.71s]  a great bounty of ruins. What are you talking about? What are you guys talking about? That's a lot.
[6499.67s -> 6502.87s]  Okay. That's, that actually just helps me a lot. Big time. All right. So we can get strength.
[6503.67s -> 6514.58s]  Yeah. If you're not going to use the boss weapon, then just remove it. Let's point
[6514.58s -> 6518.74s]  one point in strength. That's, and I can do one point strength and we'll do, uh,
[6518.74s -> 6528.47s]  I'll get 25 vitality. Good. All right. We've got a new weapon and I'm ready to check it out.
[6529.11s -> 6541.45s]  Somebody do some math with me here though. I need a calculator.
[6542.33s -> 6552.74s]  137 plus 62. That's there. It's 67, 80, 90. That's one 99 and one 15. That's 29,
[6553.62s -> 6566.97s]  one 25, 35, 36, 7, 8, 9, 41, 2, 3, 4, 144 and one 99 versus one 81, one 90.
[6567.61s -> 6579.35s]  But it has bleed and it's also as the magic built into it's close.
[6580.50s -> 6596.82s]  This also is, is it not leveled up? Oh, it just, it just says it there. That's cool. Okay.
[6599.50s -> 6613.70s]  Three 72, three 44. Okay. But it does have the bleed and it's also plus four when the
[6613.70s -> 6627.75s]  carrying a sword is plus five. So fuck it. Let's go. I'll use it now. Very important. I need to,
[6628.71s -> 6648.22s]  uh, talk to you about something. I can get his helmet. That's kind of cool. I can also get his
[6648.22s -> 6660.42s]  lion armor. Holy shit. That's a lot of defense. Look at the robustness increases intelligence
[6660.42s -> 6684.62s]  by how much, by how much is this thing increases intelligence, but it makes me, it makes me slower.
[6685.34s -> 6696.58s]  My stamina is gone. It's the same. Okay. But hold on. So I get my stamina back.
[6697.30s -> 6711.77s]  Fucking idiot. This is going to just, I'm, I'm going to tell you, this is distracting.
[6711.77s -> 6728.09s]  This is very distracting. That's going to, it gets, it's like, it's in the way. It's actually in
[6728.09s -> 6737.35s]  the way. You look like a coat hanger. I look like a moron and it's takes up too much of the screen.
[6737.35s -> 6751.40s]  Real estate. I don't like it. Fucking idiot. Well, I have to like put on other clothes then, right?
[6752.12s -> 6764.86s]  I just look like I'm about to go to sleep. I'm wearing pajamas. This is like, okay. Do you
[6764.86s -> 6769.58s]  know like back in like the, like the 1910s, this is like the pajamas that people would wear. They'd
[6769.58s -> 6779.72s]  wear like the pajama hat and pajamas. Okay. Well, whatever. It's better than it is actually
[6779.72s -> 6789.19s]  statistically better than what I had on the carrying night stuff back on. I'll keep the
[6789.19s -> 6808.30s]  dunce cap on. Now I got my new weapon. I've got my new stuff. It's time to continue the video game
[6809.67s -> 6816.98s]  and that means go find the shooting star that landed down here somewhere. I'm going to continue
[6816.98s -> 6838.20s]  Ranny's quest. You look like a Frito. Okay. I definitely don't want that. I'll put this on.
[6838.20s -> 6850.15s]  Yeah. All right. Let's go like here. We're looking for a star fallen star. Anybody sees it? Please
[6850.15s -> 6884.50s]  let me know right there. Look in the sky and it would be on the ground. Something here, man. Hold
[6884.50s -> 6911.32s]  on. Oh, I thought that was a bush. I thought that was a bush. He's stuck in the thing. He's
[6911.32s -> 6927.16s]  actually stuck in the wall. Perfect. Holy shit. This thing's fucking incredible. This weapon is
[6927.16s -> 6945.08s]  unbelievable. It is a place to go down here. Very cool. Let's do it. Katana. Good. Katana. Good.
[6945.08s -> 6951.18s]  Yes. Katana. Very good. Well, let me put the purpose. I've been saying magic Katana. Very good.
[6952.89s -> 6970.06s]  Axe talisman enhances charge attacks. That doesn't count for like this, right? It's only this.
[6971.66s -> 6986.46s]  That's really cool. It's just R2 attacks. Okay. That's still cool though. I feel like I would
[6986.46s -> 6995.26s]  want to remember that for me strong because holding R2 with like a big gigantic club because
[6995.26s -> 7000.78s]  that's the weapon I'm going to use the big huge like turkey leg. All right. Well, that was cool.
[7001.58s -> 7027.70s]  Very cool. All right. Looking for a star shooting star East East. I feel like it would be glowing
[7027.70s -> 7035.90s]  and really, really visible on like the whole map, right? I don't think it's something that I have
[7035.90s -> 7061.46s]  to go searching for desperately or maybe I do. Maybe it's tiny. Is that it? It looks like down
[7061.54s -> 7074.47s]  here. Did it make a big crater? Can I jump down there? Go down. Jump. Is this going to kill me?
[7080.33s -> 7082.97s]  Okay. I thought I was going to put with like a magical realm or something.
[7083.53s -> 7101.54s]  I thought it was going to be a magical realm. I didn't know. How do I get down?
[7101.54s -> 7112.86s]  If there's a, there's literally a path down there. Oh, I don't know. This guy's got literal brain
[7112.86s -> 7123.99s]  rot. I don't look, I don't know. It looks very magical down there. Plus it was a little fog.
[7123.99s -> 7127.99s]  It's not, it's not so foggy right now. Do you see how much fog was covering this whole thing?
[7127.99s -> 7149.40s]  I can actually see now. What? It wasn't, it was like a thousand ruins or something.
[7150.84s -> 7155.27s]  Okay. Uh, the fall damage in this game, I got to tell you, I don't make no much sense to me.
[7157.50s -> 7170.25s]  You either die or you take like five damage. This is where I jumped from. That's not that far.
[7177.85s -> 7209.22s]  That's not that far. That was a Reddit comment. This is crazy though. It's cool. How about,
[7221.24s -> 7288.47s]  oh, I got to go over there. Oh, fuck. What the fuck?
[7296.50s -> 7303.13s]  You guys, this is going on magical down here. What? I thought it was magical.
[7307.14s -> 7311.06s]  Yeah. I thought it was like magical or something. Like there's nowhere else to go.
[7311.06s -> 7329.48s]  Where else do you go? He's always frowning. I don't, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be
[7329.48s -> 7373.42s]  doing here. It's, I definitely have to go this way, but I don't understand where. Don't do it again.
[7377.83s -> 7415.59s]  I'm getting laughed at. I'm getting actually laughed at. I'm getting laughed at. Dude,
[7415.59s -> 7427.10s]  just play worms. Okay. What's happening? What keeps happening here? This game's too hard.
[7427.10s -> 7431.10s]  This game's too hard. All right. What keep, what, what the fuck actually keeps happening to me?
[7431.74s -> 7438.06s]  I don't, what's going on here? I keep getting here and then my brain goes nowhere. Go lose that way
[7439.02s -> 7447.90s]  left. See how fucking foggy it is here. Dude. It's so foggy. I couldn't see this.
[7448.70s -> 7486.70s]  It's too foggy. I couldn't see it. Are you malding? Yeah, dude. Oh, oh, oh yeah.
[7487.42s -> 7500.46s]  Are you balding? Yeah. Not that rapidly though. I'll probably have here for a while.
[7500.46s -> 7511.75s]  Probably into my like forties. It's gotta be a, a touch stone thing here, right?
[7512.55s -> 7518.58s]  Bonfire. If it's not, then like, I'm sorry, but the developers like seriously made a fucking big
[7518.58s -> 7525.69s]  mistake. If there's not a bonfire down here, then like, I mean, the devs made a fucking massive
[7525.69s -> 7528.81s]  mistake. And like, if I was on the team, I'd probably know how to do, I'd probably fix it.
[7528.81s -> 7542.50s]  You know what I mean? If I was like one of the devs, I would like know what to do. Like this,
[7542.50s -> 7546.58s]  this part here, like I'm not a fucking big fan of that. Like man, if I was on the team, I'd fuck,
[7546.58s -> 7553.11s]  I'd fix that quick. The small animation cancel at the end there. I would have fixed that if I was
[7553.11s -> 7574.15s]  on the team. What is he talking about? I'm doing the thing where like when you suck at Dark Souls,
[7574.15s -> 7578.23s]  you talk about how like the game's not good and you would explain why like, and how you're
[7578.23s -> 7590.52s]  going to fix it. And like, you would know so much better. Oh, this is we're now. Okay. I get it.
[7591.16s -> 7608.86s]  I get it. Be careful. All right. Dual headphones going in. You explain the joke minus two.
[7609.58s -> 7613.34s]  Sometimes you have to because people think I'm actually sitting here doing that.
[7618.55s -> 7635.42s]  I'm sorry. I'm not going to fall. No, I am going to look for secrets.
[7636.38s -> 7641.18s]  Oh, you go. Gross you.
[7643.50s -> 7655.69s]  What was that? People genuinely think souls games are perfect. No, they're not.
[7656.90s -> 7677.67s]  Absolutely not. Radan is in the game. It's not perfect. This is weird.
[7678.87s -> 7691.21s]  Holy shit. I thought I just walked off the edge. Whoa. It's just like the thing from clay fighter,
[7691.21s -> 7707.05s]  the blob was his name. Oh my goodness. Be careful. Yep. Yep. Yep.
[7707.93s -> 7721.67s]  Oh, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt. If it gets that reference.
[7723.58s -> 7739.82s]  You're, uh, you're a real one. That's literally from clay fighter. We were just talking about it.
[7739.82s -> 7753.43s]  I can't believe some people just don't get it. What's that? Silver tear husk.
[7753.43s -> 7764.94s]  Stop doing that or I'm going to fucking tell on you.
[7773.22s -> 7786.71s]  Those guys are fucking terribly easy. Just get them. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here.
[7786.71s -> 7801.56s]  Come here. Come here. Come here. I still get it. Right. I win. Right. Ascent butterfly.
[7804.47s -> 7832.55s]  Next game. I fall through this. Okay. For a second, I thought I was avoiding that accidentally.
[7832.55s -> 7838.98s]  One of them, maybe you can go right through. I wouldn't be surprised.
[7839.54s -> 7848.54s]  When is Elden Ring going to come out? Um, I don't know, dude. Check your fucking local listings.
[7848.54s -> 7874.18s]  Leave me the fucking line. Cool. You just got to type in, go to walmart.com and type in Elden Ring
[7874.18s -> 7897.14s]  PC CD ROM. Okay. I don't know. I don't know when it's coming out. Is that what I need?
[7897.14s -> 7914.46s]  No, it's somber smithing stone five. Pretty cool. We use the CD. I don't know very many people that
[7914.46s -> 7932.55s]  still have a CD drive on their computer. Uh, is this safe? I don't think this is safe. Is it? I'm
[7932.55s -> 7951.96s]  kind of scared to do this. I don't think this is safe. This kind of frames. Yeah. I don't,
[7952.97s -> 7958.65s]  I'm sorry guys. There's nothing I can do about it. If I could fix it, I would.
[7958.73s -> 7963.05s]  Something with a lot of people on Twitch's connections streaming to Twitch right now,
[7963.05s -> 8000.70s]  it's not good. That's seriously like unfucking good. Damn, that's good. It's better on mobile.
[8001.42s -> 8009.75s]  Um, I, it's, it's my connection to Twitch, whatever is wrong. But I would originally
[8009.75s -> 8015.67s]  be kind of concerned about this. But according to what a lot of you guys have told me, this is not
[8015.67s -> 8035.16s]  just a me problem. Cause when I do a speed test, it's perfect. Okay. I can't level up
[8035.16s -> 8046.09s]  for anything. So what I, something I do want to do, I want to get rid of this enhances left hand
[8046.09s -> 8056.55s]  shield damage. How much though? By what? Either that or maybe starlight. I feel like I'll need
[8056.55s -> 8077.99s]  it at some point. What about Glenstone arc? I have Glenstone arc as this weapon, so I don't need it
[8077.99s -> 8096.60s]  anymore because I have it baked into this weapon. It's pretty damn good. Something tells me I'm
[8096.60s -> 8102.14s]  about to fight something here. I'm getting very concerned about it. I'm getting very concerned.
[8102.14s -> 8122.86s]  Please don't curse. Yeah. All right. I'll do my best. If I think about cursing, I'll just,
[8122.86s -> 8134.58s]  I'll mute. Glove ward. It is ghost glove ward. That's exactly what I needed to upgrade. Oh, like,
[8135.14s -> 8153.27s]  I don't know if it's exact this one though. This is a boss area. It has to be. So let's prepare.
[8158.68s -> 8166.87s]  The audio is completely out of sync. I think it's because the stream keeps like hiccuping
[8167.99s -> 8199.78s]  and I think it's happening on the browser. Hey, oh, stop. Oh, stop it. Oh, stop. I don't know what
[8199.78s -> 8212.60s]  happens when that fills up, but I don't want to, I don't want to find out process frost. Okay.
[8213.32s -> 8231.82s]  So it just makes me slow. Not a big, not a big deal. Ghost glove ward pickers bell bearing.
[8232.54s -> 8244.79s]  I can bring that to the store. That's kind of cool. All right. I can read it in the store
[8246.73s -> 8251.51s]  that five times fast. Ghost pickle bell bearing. Ghost sword pickle bell.
[8252.79s -> 8268.84s]  I don't know what it was. Let's check this side. I want to miss anything.
[8276.36s -> 8288.14s]  shit. All right. I was close to my boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat.
[8288.14s -> 8292.06s]  Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. Toy boat. That was a record. I think
[8292.30s -> 8321.14s]  this channel at least that was probably at least 10 plus times in a row what other channels do that
[8322.34s -> 8327.14s]  i'm just saying in general i can't claim to have the record because somebody probably did it a
[8327.14s -> 8349.75s]  hundred times in a row that's mad damage that's actually that's actually just mad that's mad
[8349.75s -> 8359.85s]  damage i like this area's music it's very blood-borne-y that leg
[8375.85s -> 8395.42s]  great one two that's five great shield boys interesting tank boys all right so i can go
[8395.42s -> 8416.22s]  in here i could go down there let's see what's in here can't replace the boys i can at least get them
[8416.22s -> 8426.47s]  so plus three marvel tier i'm gonna do an item uh like recap essentially i picked up a lot of
[8426.47s -> 8436.31s]  stuff in the last like hour okay i think that's everything i'm gonna go down there is a desync
[8436.87s -> 8445.24s]  i i don't think there is i think i don't see it on my uh preview i honestly think it's the internet
[8445.24s -> 8459.70s]  shit that was happening with twitch's servers oh shit okay there's a boss here one of those statues
[8462.95s -> 8472.68s]  hmm i think i level up first yeah definitely i have enough runes i think to put
[8472.68s -> 8475.56s]  another point into intelligence which is what i'm gonna do
[8480.55s -> 8492.76s]  oh fuck out of here
[8499.35s -> 8524.98s]  big whip do i get the whip you kissed erba i already have what that was a different whip though
[8526.18s -> 8531.88s]  that was a like a chain it almost looked magical a magical whip would be kind of fun
[8532.28s -> 8543.88s]  hmm yeah i definitely can level up for uh going in there without a doubt so that's what we're gonna
[8543.88s -> 8593.62s]  do another larval tier oh i need that's why i don't have the arc i have it already i think
[8593.62s -> 8598.02s]  that's all i can do but i'm gonna level up unless because there's a statue back there so that's what
[8598.02s -> 8603.94s]  they want you to respawn after you die a multitude of times here i do have to pee too so we're gonna
[8603.94s -> 8617.43s]  take a break before doing whatever the heck this is yeah all right i'm going back to the bonfire
[8623.27s -> 8632.92s]  i gotta pee whoa what did i just go what no that's not what i wanted to do
[8633.64s -> 8651.42s]  what happened what it's the wrong one what's the right one this one here okay yeah this is the
[8651.42s -> 8657.98s]  right one all right uh let me see if i can level up yeah i have so many of these it's gonna be 5k
[8657.98s -> 8684.28s]  okay 23 000 24 000 i believe it's 24 or 23 23 okay i gotta kill a couple things
[8684.92s -> 8722.82s]  hello everybody aggro everyone a few more level up p why what's wrong with having is the zip

[9602.20s -> 9623.42s]  okay see how long it just took him to do that all right no more messing around time to die
[9633.37s -> 9652.50s]  larval tier silver tier mask what is that like a clay mask greatly increases arcane to the
[9652.50s -> 9675.74s]  detriment of physical attack power by how much 17 versus oh my god that's a lot it's a lot
[9676.70s -> 9700.84s]  okay well that was not that bad maybe if he was a stronger character very cool yeah i mean i we
[9700.84s -> 9706.12s]  might have to come up with like a command for like the frames or something like like exclamation
[9706.12s -> 9711.30s]  point frames and just have like they have like a corporate response like i don't understand what's
[9711.30s -> 9716.02s]  going on my internet is fine i think we've narrowed it down to possibly it's something going on on
[9716.02s -> 9733.66s]  twitch is in bear with us all right well that leads to this which this looks like the real
[9733.66s -> 9738.62s]  encounter coming up here this is a huge bridge there's no way that this is not the real fight
[9739.58s -> 9749.75s]  i have 10 000 souls i'm kind of concerned about this how come no one else is losing
[9749.75s -> 9754.79s]  frames if it's a twitch problem i don't i don't understand i thought people i thought it was
[9754.79s -> 9770.82s]  happening to other people i can upgrade the katana those are fine they've gotten way worse
[9771.78s -> 9786.42s]  other streams are fine i did switch servers brutal right now what the fuck is going on i
[9786.42s -> 9791.06s]  actually am dropping a huge an insane amount of frames though like it's actually really bad
[9791.94s -> 9801.48s]  this server might actually be worse it doesn't make any sense because i i have i i literally
[9801.48s -> 9806.20s]  have a thousand megabit upload right now like i just i just did a speed test it was like 940
[9806.20s -> 9829.67s]  megabits up i don't get it should i change back to the other server it is definitely happening to
[9829.67s -> 9836.70s]  other people it is literally happening to other people don't let anyone don't listen to everybody
[9849.00s -> 9861.27s]  worse than yesterday though it's not happening it's not happening to every streamer but it's
[9861.27s -> 9866.71s]  happening to a lot of people um that's this is like really not good though i kind of might go
[9866.71s -> 9873.91s]  to the other server yeah let me let me try that i i changed maybe it's happening to like where like
[9873.91s -> 9878.87s]  maybe some route is fucked up so people may be in like the i don't know in like the western part
[9878.87s -> 9885.11s]  of the country or something but let yeah this is bad like i'm i have six percent drop frames
[9885.91s -> 9896.26s]  let me go back to the server i was on before see if it makes it even a little bit better
[9896.82s -> 9902.39s]  because i have 6.6 percent of all frames have been dropped which that's really not that's awful
[9905.06s -> 9910.25s]  let me refresh the stream i'll be right back see if it gets any better if i go to the place
[9910.25s -> 10013.77s]  i was before i'll be right back don't go anywhere don't move a muscle be right back okay whoa
[10015.64s -> 10027.03s]  holy shit i can't even connect to this server what the fuck yeah like i i'm dropping
[10027.03s -> 10033.42s]  60 percent of all my frames trying to connect to this one what the fuck is going on right now
[10033.42s -> 10047.14s]  this is insane what i'm gonna have to connect to a i'm gonna have to go somewhere else for like
[10047.14s -> 10055.77s]  my server what the fuck this is by the way this is the server that i use i've been using for like
[10055.77s -> 10065.66s]  two straight years holy shit this is unbelievably bad i don't know what's going on but this is
[10066.22s -> 10077.67s]  really really weird i'm doing a speed test right now and i do 900 down 900 up
[10078.74s -> 10103.40s]  fuck yeah this is fucked up yeah i just did a speed test 900 900 um well we're gonna try a
[10103.40s -> 10122.34s]  different server yes there's no way i can connect to this one i will see you guys again in a moment
[10125.86s -> 10134.28s]  yeah i have officially confirmed this has nothing to do with my internet zero i just ran three or
[10134.28s -> 10139.58s]  four speed tests in a row it's perfect officially confirmed has nothing to do with my internet i'll
[10139.58s -> 10143.50s]  be right back i'm gonna try another one uh it's not my vpn i don't have my vpn's not on
[10144.06s -> 10219.37s]  be right back we're gonna try another server okay how are we doing are we good
[10223.21s -> 10236.10s]  now something's still wrong it's better but it's still really bad i'm gonna stick out let's stick
[10236.10s -> 10242.60s]  on this one for a little bit for a minute or two because this is the third server i've tried i'm
[10242.60s -> 10268.54s]  gonna stay here for a minute let's just let's just chill out for a moment i i i have a live
[10268.54s -> 10279.05s]  monitor over here and i can see that it's it's still about 10 maybe i should turn the vpn on
[10279.69s -> 10283.29s]  because that'll route traffic in a different way maybe because something to do with the connection
[10283.29s -> 10289.46s]  to twitch maybe it's a good idea to just to turn the vpn on and have it just kind of go somewhere
[10289.46s -> 10306.47s]  else and have the track of traffic come in a circle it seems better we'll give it a moment
[10306.47s -> 10315.54s]  oh hello what can i do for you all right i'm gonna i'm not gonna go brb actually i'm technically
[10315.54s -> 10321.69s]  gonna go brb because i think you need something uh i'm gonna sit here and see because i think it's
[10321.69s -> 10330.90s]  all right it's definitely better than it was before at least it seems that way what are you
[10330.90s -> 10339.32s]  doing where are you going what are you doing ato all right yeah i think he's probably just
[10339.32s -> 10341.80s]  he just i think he wants a treat or something i would just give him a treat
[10342.52s -> 10352.17s]  oh you want a treat yeah he always wants a treat he wants a biscuit um i i'm just gonna go for it
[10357.18s -> 10361.48s]  well the treat stream that's right me and holly we're we're actually talking about it we were
[10361.48s -> 10366.82s]  like how are we gonna do like the treat tier list how are we gonna do a treat tier list i tell
[10368.68s -> 10372.22s]  yeah it's better than it was before and we're gonna have to deal with it because i can't just
[10372.22s -> 10386.10s]  sit here and just do nothing for like another 40 minutes so sorry about that treat stream yeah
[10386.10s -> 10395.00s]  we actually did talk about it but sorry everybody i know this is kind of annoying but it's annoying
[10395.00s -> 10402.70s]  for me too trust me but it seems to be settling down dude i don't know what's going on with the
[10402.70s -> 10406.78s]  west coast servers maybe the josh you were saying the east coast servers are doing it too but
[10408.55s -> 10412.71s]  i connected to the server that i've been connecting to for years and i couldn't even
[10412.71s -> 10422.46s]  put anything through but it's okay it's all good i'm just glad it's not my problem because
[10422.46s -> 10428.63s]  you guys know i have like traumatic experiences with my internet being terrible but thankfully
[10428.63s -> 10450.31s]  i can confirm that it's not my internet but we continue it's a long bridge oh oh okay
[10451.54s -> 10459.11s]  we see auto um he just ran away all he gave him a treat and he's he now he doesn't care about me
[10459.83s -> 10467.05s]  he's like hanging out with her he's incredibly food motivated wait go to the end of the bridge
[10474.82s -> 10488.22s]  maybe a little bit later a little bit later i'll show i i will show auto i actually he did lose one
[10488.22s -> 10503.51s]  pound but that's good i wonder if i can get down there like right there he was way too chunky
[10504.55s -> 10517.83s]  weight like bad he's supposed to be like between like 22 and like 26 pounds yeah
[10518.87s -> 10528.36s]  he may have been uh closer to 30 so i'm glad that he's uh getting back down to like 27
[10528.36s -> 10534.12s]  we want i'm trying to get him to 26 because he's a dachshund mix so he's not he's actually
[10534.12s -> 10538.76s]  supposed to be a little he's supposed to be bigger so his ideal weight is like 24 to 26
[10540.09s -> 10557.03s]  so he was like 28 he's down now to like 27 trying to get him down to 20 all right you get it let's
[10557.03s -> 10587.10s]  go fuck you well these guys got a lot of health huh all shrimps get the mushrooms oh that you
[10587.10s -> 10606.90s]  don't like that jawbone axe pretty cool these guys really don't like that move oh if you're
[10606.98s -> 10613.86s]  getting um stream syncing problems because of the weird server issues uh refreshing apparently
[10613.86s -> 10625.83s]  works load of blood your eminence i beg you grant me a seat at the table of the dynasty
[10626.63s -> 10636.86s]  long live the mogwin dynasty long live that come on with dynasty i kill these things no
[10652.42s -> 10656.66s]  there's been a split second delay for months i think i went over this before that like
[10657.46s -> 10664.09s]  the way that my webcam is picking up my voice like my voice comes out sometimes my voice doesn't
[10664.09s -> 10687.58s]  match my mouth movements a lot of times that's normal i actually talk really weird all right so
[10687.58s -> 10703.51s]  where am i going from here probably explore this top part i get on the horse too we're singing
[10703.51s -> 10766.97s]  again this is gonna am i gonna get attacked by like the goats is it a goat call all right for
[10766.97s -> 10790.84s]  interrupting it was such a weird death face forward that was actually kind of like terrifying

[10968.95s -> 10980.28s]  i'm the incest ancestral woods grace and then jump from all right well that's a lot hold on
[10981.16s -> 11000.30s]  i have to be careful i could get so easily killed too be very easy for me to get killed

[11902.71s -> 11906.47s]  the old-fashioned like dear old dad used to make that's like that's like that drink that is
[11906.47s -> 11911.43s]  undrinkable it's probably like 40 alcohol it's probably that it's what half the drink is alcohol
[11918.44s -> 11922.28s]  don't make it so sweet this time let me show you let me show you how dear old dad used to make it
[11927.18s -> 11942.06s]  oh no no not 40 alcohol by volume i mean like the drink is 50 alcohol and 50 something else
[11942.06s -> 11958.47s]  which is like oh that's too much all right i need i need two more dude you're a lightweight
[11958.87s -> 11979.45s]  okay please yep there it is i can upgrade the katana not yet oh dude shot what do you do

[12104.73s -> 12134.76s]  if they laugh this is like too this is too simple but what this room is this is too simple this
[12134.76s -> 12160.58s]  guy's gonna turn into like an eagle or something this person's gonna turn to an eagle ancestral
[12160.58s -> 12172.94s]  infant's head what is that didn't it say something about that i have an item that is wait what is
[12172.94s -> 12191.64s]  that uses fp to spray spirit vapor the vapor becomes a temporary geyser which deals continuous
[12191.64s -> 12206.36s]  damage to everything it touches and then the helmet that i have right strengthens ancestral
[12206.36s -> 12233.21s]  infant's head is it just one use or how does this work i'm just gonna try it that's actually kind
[12233.21s -> 12243.80s]  of cool it's just reusable that's really actually pretty cool i wonder how much more significant it
[12243.80s -> 12249.83s]  is if you have the helmet on all right well i'm gonna keep it on the bar because that's kind of
[12249.83s -> 12259.96s]  cool i might use it how do i get out of here now do i have to just teleport i'm not sure i can
[12259.96s -> 12270.02s]  like do anything about this i think i just teleport unless i'm missing something else here
[12273.11s -> 12285.53s]  yeah i got i gotta teleport i gotta teleport out of here jump what do you mean jump jump
[12287.74s -> 12299.61s]  jump from here foot i mean like no guys i can't that's not gonna happen

[12319.70s -> 12331.03s]  really been paying attention to it how are we going off let me see how many have dropped
[12332.79s -> 12337.54s]  it's better than the it's better than it was it's still a piece of shit though but it's better than
[12337.54s -> 12344.65s]  it was we went from six point eight percent to three point five percent so i don't know what
[12344.65s -> 12369.13s]  the solution is but well hopefully they fix it soon well i'll just stay on this server i need
[12369.13s -> 12376.58s]  to upgrade the katana we're gonna do that oh what was that shit they were saying about the um
[12377.72s -> 12381.64s]  somebody was here and like don't go near them they're scary or something whatever it was

[12729.72s -> 12740.06s]  gateway is hidden it will lead you to garank thanks let's just let's just go do that i guess
[12740.06s -> 12746.55s]  it's kind of in the front of the brain right now wait i need to upgrade uh people yes
[12747.35s -> 12756.71s]  upgrade people upgrade people this way at least i can do uh i could probably do all like a few
[12756.71s -> 12773.80s]  times yeah i just need souls 34 that's a lot 3400 great many runes i think i would like that

[12889.56s -> 12901.78s]  that's part of it let's see what this is very interesting they said there's a gate
[12901.78s -> 12908.25s]  hidden over here it really is wow it really is kind of just buried in the corner here
[12909.13s -> 12930.57s]  i definitely don't think i would have found this look it up regal's dragon barrow hey hey

[12956.66s -> 12974.54s]  second half is here so that's interesting dragon barrel so holy shit what is that i was scared
[12974.54s -> 12980.57s]  though that actually scared me that was terrifying to me that was terrifying why are you writing
[12980.57s -> 12984.81s]  notes like a nerd because i'm trying to good luck keeping track of anything going on
[12989.61s -> 13011.22s]  east yield sanctum okay so this is the guy he's like i'm gonna send you to my friend
[13017.16s -> 13029.00s]  hand over death root let me let me first uh figure out what i'm handing them
[13029.72s -> 13043.78s]  so i don't even know what it is death root east clergyman seeks and devours these
[13044.58s -> 13060.17s]  where did i get this i don't know where i got that from where is that from like your notes

[13135.48s -> 13145.46s]  uh said to tremble when close to death root
[13145.62s -> 13151.38s]  i said to tremble when near death root the murky violet iris writhes if it's alive
[13151.38s -> 13166.33s]  i wonder what that that's an indicator on the screen fort farrowth in the dragon barrel
[13166.89s -> 13172.58s]  that was kind of interesting what was the other thing give me two things flaw
[13173.54s -> 13192.76s]  was it sometimes i like kind of wish this game had a like combat log of history that happened
[13193.72s -> 13202.31s]  happened what was it i just got it gave me two things i and the claw but what is
[13203.51s -> 13240.47s]  it's a weapon where is it it's a talisman eighth talisman where is it didn't give me two things
[13241.03s -> 13254.28s]  it's an offhand oh bestial incantations okay i was i'm looking around i thought it was an item
[13254.28s -> 13263.40s]  um that's kind of cool so it's a dude does that thing that cast spells very cool all right that's
[13263.40s -> 13273.96s]  pretty nice all right should i uh just get embarrassed and die from this thing that's
[13273.96s -> 13277.08s]  really cool all right let's uh this area i'm probably not supposed to be here so let's go
[13277.08s -> 13296.38s]  ahead and like just spray this guy wait this is a boss what this is a boss that took me a while to
[13296.38s -> 13333.08s]  figure that out i was mesmerized okay he's that's one hit i don't i don't think i'm uh
[13335.56s -> 13350.04s]  it's a weird place to fight him too you're not hostile until you hit him well now i now i want
[13350.04s -> 13367.16s]  to go out there and fight him i was he versus this stuff let's see very bad what if he was like oh
[13367.16s -> 13389.53s]  and i blinded him i i'm gonna try it one more time it's just fun whoa that goes far so i'm an
[13389.53s -> 13399.32s]  oleg actually i'll summon oleg get the hell out of here man can you not follow me inside
[13399.32s -> 13407.35s]  that actually could be kind of funny if i can just cheese him no no i'll come back and actually
[13407.35s -> 13413.19s]  fight him i want to actually fight all right yeah i'm level like 62 or something i shouldn't be here
[13413.91s -> 13420.47s]  okay well that was kind of cool now i know what this is for we're all the way over here
[13421.35s -> 13433.50s]  uh so we are going to go back to knock around because i need to light the fires in knock run
[13446.33s -> 13464.41s]  still missing i believe who who files how's the chewy noise
[13465.46s -> 13472.39s]  joey joey i always have to lean in and get off camera to do a voice because i don't want to be
[13472.95s -> 13482.71s]  because i make like weird scary weird faces this is seriously this is not the closest
[13486.31s -> 13503.26s]  this one closer but i'm already doing it why is the stream stuttering exclamation point frames
[13532.28s -> 13551.94s]  all right let's go let's go let's go i definitely am an idiot because there's absolutely another
[13551.94s -> 13557.13s]  bonfire somewhere right here it's all right though i need two more fires we fight whatever
[13557.13s -> 13565.02s]  that is and then maybe i'll do i continue that the ranny quest all right i did i went to the
[13565.02s -> 13601.40s]  right i need to go to the left what about yes yes oh my god really yes now here's an interesting
[13601.40s -> 13625.30s]  thing what's this for whoa that person alive holy shit i think that person's alive oh my god
[13626.02s -> 13661.32s]  this is huge okay night's sacred ground oh um maybe i'll find a bonfire og you found
[13661.32s -> 13684.78s]  renee's quest og you found renee's quest silver tier who's that ruin are you can't they can't get
[13684.78s -> 13699.37s]  up here so it doesn't matter i'm just i'm doing item search you know that there's but yeah of
[13699.37s -> 13718.46s]  course there is celestial dew i got a couple of those now tell a joke um i'm not very good
[13718.46s -> 13742.52s]  with jokes i'm not very good with i'm not very good with jokes can i go down here okay jump to

[13769.18s -> 13798.98s]  all you do is that all you do okay hopefully there's no item on that person
[13800.42s -> 13837.85s]  i would be remarkably pissed off it's a big ruin another way to go over here what are these
[13837.85s -> 13850.90s]  butterflies oh frames drops only happen when you attack i think uh i think that might be
[13851.78s -> 13873.69s]  a really interesting coincidence i wasn't make it it's your pc it's not my pc my pc's fine
[13875.78s -> 13881.80s]  my game is playing flawlessly my internet is perfect there's nothing wrong with my face
[13881.80s -> 13919.45s]  i have no pimples to go up where we're going oh shiny in there it's too quiet in this place
[13919.45s -> 13922.94s]  it just is that usually means something horrible is about to happen
[13925.18s -> 13947.30s]  black wet blade yep i knew it i heard it oh it's you what's that how many do i have
[13948.18s -> 13963.03s]  what do you say i have i have seven stone sword keys i'm gonna use it this looks like an npc
[13963.67s -> 13982.50s]  why can i attack this person what's going on who is this oh it's a chest
[13987.77s -> 14017.54s]  okay what is it wow this is gold mimic tier ashes that's a gold beam legendary ashen remains used
[14017.54s -> 14026.26s]  to summon the spirit of a mimic tier summoning consumes hp rather than fp the spirit takes the
[14026.26s -> 14031.22s]  form of the summoner to fight alongside them but its mimicry does not extend in imitating the
[14031.22s -> 14045.42s]  summoner's will what do i summon a copy of myself to run around that's kind of interesting i'm
[14045.42s -> 14068.57s]  curious this one sucks oh legs better i'll try it oh no how much does it cost to use
[14069.53s -> 14073.54s]  that's kind of good it's literally the best summoned by a thousand miles
[14074.18s -> 14082.58s]  because how many keys that take to get in here not that many there's only one okay we're good
[14084.90s -> 14108.95s]  very cool okay more items i i'm pretty i'm item collect andy by the way just
[14109.67s -> 14115.53s]  i guess everybody needs to know that if i if it's available i'm gonna try to get it
[14116.17s -> 14141.53s]  how do i get over there the gold the ball is alive why is the ball alive the ball has a health bar
[14144.42s -> 14166.34s]  what is this an enemy why is the ball alive oh shit doesn't look like it does that much damage
[14171.27s -> 14177.93s]  don't fucking go that close holy shit it does a lot a lot a lot like a huge a lot
[14182.92s -> 14198.38s]  oh man fuck you i gotta have a hit a wall get away from me you're stuck
[14205.59s -> 14229.21s]  oh jesus okay that's a okay that was a sentient ball what did it drop

[14235.77s -> 14263.56s]  it's so weird it's weird that was just odd okay nothing let's go there's so many cool
[14263.56s -> 14270.36s]  enemies and stuff and then there's just a ball that's very from software though right
[14271.32s -> 14283.06s]  god it's so from software we're slowly making our way down to the lady huge lady there sitting
[14283.06s -> 14301.24s]  there an old lady this takes health it said i'm very curious how that works how okay that's a
[14301.24s -> 14321.08s]  lot of health not some health that's so stupid he's a fucking moron all right this might be
[14321.08s -> 14326.84s]  the best someone in the game if it wasn't this character because that's a move i don't think is
[14326.84s -> 14354.23s]  worth doing he's gonna do the spinning staff move oh he sprayed the goo he's just a mind of his own
[14354.23s -> 14360.95s]  he's trying to drink a potion now i understand why this is so fun to watch you like watch the

[14741.96s -> 14750.71s]  key hidden treasure of the eternal city of nokrom this blood-drenched fetish is proof
[14751.43s -> 14755.11s]  of the high treason committed by the eternal city and symbolizes its downfall
[14755.67s -> 14761.19s]  and i'll be wielded by those without a fate but it's said to be able to harm the greater will
[14761.19s -> 14779.13s]  and its vassals let's take this to ronnie i got a super glove warp okay this doesn't do anything

[15005.91s -> 15019.51s]  still fighting me this weapon is so good i didn't abandon oleg what are you talking about i'm sure
[15019.51s -> 15047.94s]  he'll set he'll be really useful in a lot of time a lot of places level up time this area looks
[15047.94s -> 15081.27s]  cool this area is really cool 25 000 i think is what i need maybe 22 20 what do i need
[15081.27s -> 15121.83s]  25 all right i'm gonna kill a few more people hey come on it's so good it's so good
[15129.64s -> 15149.54s]  that enough i think i need 25 i'll just kill this group here that's such a great move i wonder if
[15149.54s -> 15153.30s]  that's only good against these guys but whatever i'll take it he's just kind of a pain in the ass
[15153.30s -> 15169.03s]  all right that should do it it was 25 and some change hopefully it's not more than that
[15169.67s -> 15180.18s]  works on shield with enemies too wow that sounds fucking incredible uh health or more
[15180.18s -> 15193.11s]  into i'm gonna try to get health to 30 i feel like i'm really lacking in that right now all right

[15201.88s -> 15231.16s]  deer bosses something okay let's go i wonder how different this one will be
[15231.16s -> 15259.88s]  let's go eagle ancestor spirit is it the same fight seems to be pretty similar
[15267.16s -> 15306.41s]  two that's different what so this one does three what that does four
[15306.49s -> 15313.50s]  four that's a one two three four
[15339.53s -> 15384.60s]  these pigs are in the way don't be greedy i love that sound whoa what's this
[15393.64s -> 15400.54s]  excuse me what happened here you healed to full health oh well that's gotta stop that from
[15400.54s -> 15414.78s]  happening i have to stay i have to stutter that i think what the holy shit okay that was okay so
[15414.78s -> 15472.94s]  that it's not a big aoe move it's a heel what the fuck it's like bunny hopping is that it holy
[15472.94s -> 15521.62s]  fuck i thought you're gonna do the bunny hop yeah oh fuck i think it's run maybe you can dodge
[15521.62s -> 15570.55s]  through it no no no no no no no no no no i gotta go faster i gotta kill him faster than this
[15571.19s -> 15583.14s]  i just happen to be drinking all right yeah i gotta kill i gotta kill you faster than this

[15689.32s -> 15692.36s]  times i thought it was a giant aoe explosion that's why i didn't do it the first time and
[15692.36s -> 15709.62s]  he got full health i got him like i'm no sword skill um i feel like i could have just beaten
[15709.62s -> 15720.04s]  him without it i'll try it though don't even make sure you use that sheath magic i'll try it
[15720.76s -> 15740.44s]  he shit like that like i didn't know that now i know that i'm ready yes dead what about killing
[15740.44s -> 15747.67s]  the animals uh i could try it maybe it's the amount of heal he gets that's a great question
[15747.67s -> 15804.15s]  actually i should probably try it god damn it got greedy being stupid yep that's definitely
[15804.15s -> 15811.26s]  that's what it is he eats the animals he eats the animals all right i gotta i gotta run around him
[15811.26s -> 15814.94s]  oh come on i could have had an opportunity all right yeah i he i gotta get rid of the animals
[15815.96s -> 15856.52s]  he eats the animals that's what's going on here oh that's a stagger let's get him right in the
[15856.52s -> 15895.00s]  head see you later oops try dodge it that hurts me too all right bro fuck you
[15905.48s -> 15964.60s]  fuck what he added that dude what the fuck stop yes yes yes yes yes that's a remembrance
[15967.94s -> 15976.36s]  really okay that's actually kind of cool i wonder what that boss weapon is
[15979.66s -> 15990.49s]  all right really cool really really cool pretty cool pretty cool that's another level too very
[15990.49s -> 16004.49s]  nice i want to see what that does whatever to the burger king head uh it was kind of nerfing me
[16004.49s -> 16008.87s]  this thing dude this thing is the same thing as the burger king head the only difference is it
[16008.87s -> 16018.41s]  does not it's way less defense but this brings my stamina down 10 this doesn't it gives me the same
[16018.49s -> 16036.28s]  intellect increase but it's not as funny you can do this again what's that all about
[16050.55s -> 16057.35s]  okay so let's do let's see what the remembrance is i have to imagine this is probably sorcery
[16058.76s -> 16069.58s]  right because i mean think about it that was pretty much all sorcery imagining a pretty major
[16069.58s -> 16085.45s]  spell winged great horn axe ancestral spirits horn restores fp upon defeating enemies
[16086.17s -> 16107.61s]  this is a helmet or is this a talisman this is kind of huge deal how much fp does it bring back
[16107.61s -> 16126.50s]  because man we're gonna be needing that talisman it's only about three fp per kill is that worth it
[16127.54s -> 16145.40s]  i guess maybe hold on how much does it cost to how much fp does this thing use hard to tell
[16145.40s -> 16152.04s]  is that worth using well how much is like a just regular source removed to tell you
[16152.84s -> 16165.91s]  fp costs seven okay so this is 12 i get three back per kill which would mean if there's like
[16165.91s -> 16181.06s]  three or four enemies i don't know i don't know worth it more just to probably level up into fp
[16181.70s -> 16190.62s]  what else are you using your talisman slots for this one i'm not taking off for the rest of the
[16190.62s -> 16198.31s]  game this one i could replace because i'm using the magic on the weapon not necessarily sorceries
[16198.31s -> 16213.03s]  that much anymore and this is i could probably replace this one i'll get it the heal is pointless
[16214.70s -> 16232.38s]  i'll get it let's try it i want it let's try it we'll put it on okay bingo restores fp upon
[16232.38s -> 16259.56s]  defeating enemies i replaced the heel very cool well that was awesome oh oh uh ronnie do i have
[16259.56s -> 16277.10s]  any uh crunchies i have to be careful i do have the finger blade so i gotta bring it back to ronnie
[16278.54s -> 16299.50s]  see what else i have to do i want to test that talisman as well see if it's worth it okay hello
[16302.09s -> 16308.81s]  it was the not blithe it seemeth even in my slumber i sensed it i picked it up it is in

[17278.39s -> 17282.66s]  now i can level up but let me see what else is okay hold on something up here
[17283.30s -> 17295.53s]  oh yeah i see the ladder i see the ladder from come on from what's with this like what's with

[17375.82s -> 17402.54s]  that's how that works there better be something good up here all right what's the least the path
[17402.54s -> 17408.79s]  of the least resistance here i don't know i'm gonna get spawned on they're gonna climb up
[17408.79s -> 17411.99s]  something i gotta be i gotta get myself situated that straightaway right there
[17450.94s -> 17458.41s]  boost fp restoration from flask it's really not that big of a deal that's not worth climbing
[17458.41s -> 17469.85s]  two ladders for that's not worth climbing two ladders for okay uh that's it nothing else here
[17469.85s -> 17476.18s]  i'm just gonna jump down to here i'm gonna go back down i'm gonna go up a little bit more though
[17476.74s -> 17498.31s]  be careful wait why uh i do want to go here though because there was another place to go
[17499.03s -> 17513.37s]  what is this wait no no no no no this is the way up oh i think i missed something
[17514.33s -> 17530.25s]  i think i missed an item maybe not no never mind
[17543.58s -> 17552.92s]  okay i think that's it at least well that's cool to get i'll try it out a little bit flip
[17552.92s -> 17558.28s]  the thing upside down go back up here and i guess do whatever i need to do for this uh
[17559.42s -> 17571.08s]  ron rainy quest ronnie i haven't been here for a few hours what's going on uh with that hat
[17571.64s -> 17577.16s]  i lost a bet with uh chat and they said that i had to wear this hat for the next three to six
[17577.16s -> 17584.76s]  hours of gameplay um it does it's so stupid when you put this on you take 25 more damage from all
[17584.76s -> 17591.42s]  sources uh it's a lot of like speed runners and like like really like hardcore gamers are going
[17591.42s -> 17596.70s]  to be using it because your movement speed is like 10 faster so but it's like really bad to
[17596.70s -> 17602.90s]  have on right now it's actually a pretty stupid thing to wear for like a first playthrough
[17605.27s -> 17609.11s]  and actually it might even be 30 more damage with a 10 movement speed buff
[17625.03s -> 17627.67s]  why do they just lie all the time i don't know because it's kind of funny
[17628.47s -> 17632.42s]  well i'm just making conversation but oh what's going on with you
[17634.10s -> 17637.78s]  oh
[17654.42s -> 17656.98s]  i'm gonna get this to 30 and then we're gonna do some more intelligence
[17657.62s -> 17669.38s]  let's check it out magic down four i'll try it see what it does
[17676.95s -> 17694.07s]  oh actually pretty good area denial i charge it i can charge it that's pretty good denial
[17694.07s -> 17699.05s]  right like i can kind of catch people up guard does like no damage yeah but it's probably good
[17699.05s -> 17716.70s]  to some area denial okay now let's go for it i already saw this let me check the frames i'm
[17716.70s -> 17732.30s]  just curious it's a pretty consistent three percent frame drop for some reason on twitch what's going
[17732.30s -> 17744.26s]  on with my connection to your servers what's going on here no no i don't want to do this
[17744.26s -> 17758.70s]  area there are hands here i don't want to do it no no no i don't want to do their hands here
[17759.34s -> 17769.77s]  i don't want to do it this is my least favorite enemy in the game are you actually back i killed

[17912.84s -> 17914.44s]  i feel like i'm not supposed to be playing here
[17925.53s -> 17944.84s]  let's go dodge what the fuck is happening stop getting caught on whatever bullshit you're
[17944.84s -> 17990.17s]  getting caught on get out of here with your fingers fucking hand away from me

[19355.06s -> 19366.20s]  got to do it again run past i'm not gonna i refuse it's like every organ has been taken out
[19366.76s -> 19375.30s]  like rubbing alcohol dumped on it and put back in my body like i beat them i can have i can ride
[19375.30s -> 19380.74s]  my horse what i didn't know that when can i when have i ever been able to ride a horse like this
[19380.74s -> 19390.02s]  on a bridge where are my souls where the fuck are they where are my souls why are they in this
[19390.02s -> 19406.38s]  corner oh my god check this out it's awful it doesn't do shit that's terrible i'd rather do
[19406.38s -> 19418.68s]  downpour in fact like i would rather probably just do this just like spray fucking nickelodeon
[19418.68s -> 19435.43s]  gac everywhere oh you better believe that strategy are you kidding me we're playing mario kart it's
[19435.43s -> 19482.57s]  oil just kind of sucks fine i i don't want to i hate ripping the fucking band-aid off and giving
[19482.57s -> 19491.05s]  up you would you are dead you are dead you were dead they were you you were dead it's just the
[19491.05s -> 19497.93s]  poison build up that fucking language that was like that language was so incorrect for me that
[19497.93s -> 19532.84s]  fucking language what's that remember you're gonna get an epic item come on i'll be back
[19533.48s -> 19563.24s]  that's poison build up say it causes wearer too consumable to be poisoned
[19592.01s -> 19596.73s]  poison build up i know stop saying it because it's making me fucking angry and i'm angry about it
[19596.73s -> 19607.18s]  and i keep seeing it is i'm i'm so yeah it's poison build up first mark of death stargazer
[19607.18s -> 19641.91s]  heirloom that's plus five intelligence okay i have a question is this considered a sorcery
[19643.43s -> 19647.83s]  or is that just magic intelligence based scaling does that consider it a sorcery
[19648.39s -> 19665.98s]  it's a weapon skill so it's not a sorcery it just stacks with intelligence okay so i i'm gonna lose
[19665.98s -> 19672.52s]  the potency but i mean that's just gonna make this weapon do so much more damage and gets me closer
[19672.52s -> 19682.49s]  to the other stuff but now i scale even more oh my god plus 82 holy shit all right so that's all
[19682.49s -> 19685.61s]  it's up here there was something else up here too what was that was like a key item or something
[19685.61s -> 19702.18s]  what was it what else was down there's something else here first mark carved into lunar princess
[19702.18s -> 19727.75s]  ronnie's discarded what that's her what happened what the hell happened also known as the half
[19727.75s -> 19733.99s]  wheel wound of the centipede this curse mark was carved at the moment of death of the first demi
[19733.99s -> 19741.19s]  god and should have taken the shape of a circle however two demi gods perished at the same time
[19742.15s -> 19746.97s]  breaking the curse mark into two half wheels ranny was the first of the demi gods whose
[19746.97s -> 19766.89s]  flesh perished while the prince of death perished in soul alone does that mean so what where do i

[23789.42s -> 23799.29s]  can go that's not this way it's not okay so i'm going to lead to believe i'm led to believe that
[23799.29s -> 23806.26s]  i'm going to go back to the other bonfire the one that was over here ansel river downstream no
[23807.06s -> 23814.55s]  which one i believe it was downstream imagine if i had a voice like this it'd be so
[23815.90s -> 23819.42s]  the hours would melt away so much quicker than the way that i talk now
[23828.28s -> 23836.28s]  my chaps am i going chaps am i going the right way i don't remember trying to find out where that
[23837.16s -> 23856.68s]  is oh i think if i were to go further down for which way it was ansel river main i think it was
[23861.78s -> 23871.59s]  you tell me where to go i'm not going to stop doing that you tell me where to go i'm not going
[23871.59s -> 23885.02s]  to stop go to the main and turn right if that person's lying i'm going back to british accent
[23885.02s -> 23913.13s]  cringe i was wrong i'm led to believe that you're getting the completely incorrect the ant place is
[23913.13s -> 23926.46s]  down river so i go to here go down to the right path i'm telling you that i'm punishing that
[23926.46s -> 23938.20s]  person 5000 people are leaving you're losing viewers it's so funny losing viewers because
[23938.20s -> 23952.79s]  i'm doing like a english accent that's so funny doing an english accent and people like i'm fucking
[23952.79s -> 23968.87s]  out of here i'm leaving man okay so i haven't been down this way maybe i have i don't know
[23968.87s -> 23985.77s]  all these tunnels look exactly the same like gone i dude i don't know i'm just gonna go in
[23985.77s -> 23999.93s]  a direction is run i actually don't fucking know okay this is right i have not been this way
[24001.19s -> 24016.22s]  melted mushroom come back okay if you have me in like a just come back what i did an english
[24016.22s -> 24021.26s]  accent and 500 people left more than that almost a thousand people left just come back come back
[24021.26s -> 24038.15s]  what what's the problem do you have a problem come back come back wait i've already been out
[24038.15s -> 24049.91s]  no i this is new this is very new another one of these people sitting in a chair
[24050.79s -> 24081.67s]  but dragon kin soldier of nox stella well his whole body's like
[24104.25s -> 24117.67s]  all right when he does it in the middle he goes he does it twice your body is so weird man i can't
[24117.67s -> 24139.69s]  hit it he's like missing parts of his body holy shit that hurts a lot
[24145.90s -> 24205.38s]  fuck holy smokes the fuck out of here so strong this weapon is so good it's unreal how good that
[24205.38s -> 24220.39s]  is that shit does 400 damage every time i did it now i mean the problem with this which i have
[24220.39s -> 24231.64s]  to be careful is it takes i kind of takes a second use the ash of war to buff its magic scaling
[24236.68s -> 24239.96s]  here's the crazy part right this is the most ridiculous part about this weapon
[24243.67s -> 24250.23s]  i have not been building this character all intelligence really i mean i put like i put
[24250.23s -> 24258.41s]  like 10 what 11 points in dexterity if i had just 50 points in intelligence this might be just stupid
[24267.77s -> 24278.60s]  you're over leveled i don't i'm only level 70 i'm not that high when i because people
[24278.60s -> 24286.46s]  okay his thing people said i was under leveled for radan and i was like 55 for radan this boss
[24286.46s -> 24295.16s]  is an earlier game boss well that makes sense too this area is but that this area has to be
[24295.16s -> 24300.76s]  after radan though because this is part of the witch's quest or am i just out of my mind and
[24300.76s -> 24315.38s]  i just found this isn't the quest this is not part of the quest oh okay so there's just there's
[24315.38s -> 24328.31s]  just a boss down here very cool well what was the spell i got some kind of weird like frost spell
[24328.31s -> 24340.28s]  or something didn't i what was it didn't i get a new spell frozen lightning spear oh it's an
[24340.28s -> 24358.38s]  incantation okay well that was cool that was very cool this is an area that you can get too early
[24359.18s -> 24375.93s]  this game is insane this guy's just down here game's insane great ghost glove ward
[24377.46s -> 24387.18s]  there's probably only like four of these in the game okay well that's awesome uh
[24388.81s -> 24399.10s]  should i just leave so much more down here uh yeah i gotta keep doing the what's what am i
[24399.10s -> 24409.13s]  even look what am i doing down here for rena's quest but what am i actually doing here i don't
[24409.13s -> 24435.91s]  know to go kill the shade thing she talked about is it down here let's go the other way
[24436.71s -> 24462.57s]  oh all right um so i need 29 i'll be fine so if i were to go go back over here where was that
[24462.57s -> 24472.70s]  area with all the red bugs and shit and my throat's been kind of annoyed cancel river main to main
[24474.97s -> 24479.21s]  and then head into that okay yeah my throat's been although i'm just talking a lot
[24479.77s -> 24492.25s]  i'll probably get some water in a minute here okay so like over here this is where i came from
[24492.25s -> 24507.22s]  so from here it was another way wasn't there yeah there was okay there was another way to go
[24507.22s -> 24512.25s]  that's right that's a whole huge area that i just was there for like an hour and a half
[24513.21s -> 24523.03s]  i don't know why am i fighting these people how long am i going to play tonight
[24523.03s -> 24531.86s]  um was like another hour or two couple hours maybe a little more i think oh if i still have
[24531.86s -> 24541.90s]  gas all right so i went through those doors that was where i went through there was that big
[24542.46s -> 24551.08s]  ugly guy i did not go this way so we'll check this out you're gonna go kill the fat guy before
[24551.08s -> 24570.74s]  the end of the stream possibly i don't know all right what else is down here waterfall
[24571.46s -> 24581.61s]  am i gonna die holy shit it goes down it goes down it doesn't go down man no it goes down
[24582.41s -> 24596.39s]  okay so not there it too no it don't like my favorite part of that video is the
[24597.11s -> 24609.56s]  when he leans back like that he goes like it goes okay so back through here
[24610.28s -> 24620.36s]  this is just kind of taking me back to the area that i was before i'm right at the ants
[24622.54s -> 24642.39s]  i need a better gamer chair holy shit this thing sucks this thing actually sucks
[24643.03s -> 24655.70s]  like a this is like concrete elbow pads they'll go this way i didn't go this way you're right
[24657.11s -> 24680.23s]  don't think i did i got a lot of upgrades to do too what do you want what do you want ugly
[24682.81s -> 24686.73s]  i need a much better gamer chair an actual really comfortable one that has a good support and
[24686.73s -> 24706.47s]  everything moxtella eternal city wait have i been here like i've been here have i been here
[24707.19s -> 24721.82s]  oh i don't think so i guess not i haven't okay damn there's more shit down here
[24733.91s -> 25041.54s]  i gotta pee so bad i gotta pee this time see you guys in like two minutes oh i don't know
[25041.54s -> 25049.05s]  if i'm like junking up my voice but my throat is killing me i don't know why it's only one side of
[25049.05s -> 25066.89s]  my throat too am i screaming too much maybe i got some water though i'll be all right we'll go for
[25066.89s -> 25087.24s]  like another hour or two we'll see what happens at the end of this because once i get to wherever
[25087.24s -> 25092.41s]  i need to go here i'll try to complete some more of this quest line i don't know how much longer
[25092.41s -> 25113.37s]  it's gonna go it'll be a long time for all i know okay i did get some more water though i want to
[25113.37s -> 25122.98s]  make sure it's cold i got an ice cube in here you're too tight no i'm good i'm good i'll be good for
[25122.98s -> 25131.67s]  like another half hour at least and then we'll be live again tomorrow we'll do it again tomorrow
[25133.14s -> 25136.82s]  then after tomorrow i'm gonna have to start to figure out what i want to do with this game
[25140.04s -> 25149.80s]  we'll see i i really don't know i'm still having a bunch of fun and i'm still finding new things
[25149.80s -> 25186.54s]  and finding more reasons to play oh that person riding a bug can i use my horse down here time
[25186.54s -> 25198.90s]  tomorrow probably on the same town for about four o'clock pacific four p.m pacific uh i could almost
[25198.90s -> 25203.38s]  level up again and i think i'm gonna just keep putting in intelligence try to get to that 52
[25204.18s -> 25218.84s]  i can't use the horse here i go up into the building or right this way there is so much
[25218.84s -> 25225.38s]  content there really is i don't it's like it's kind of overwhelming in a way it's just it's
[25225.94s -> 25251.80s]  i so much to do there's so much going on oh that hurts oh that hurts a lot
[25252.76s -> 25264.63s]  it's very overwhelming yeah it's every and every area is so different and fresh it is every area
[25264.63s -> 25272.31s]  just feels so and that's why it's almost hard to remember what's going on because everything
[25272.31s -> 25277.99s]  is so different there's so much going on that it's almost like wait this is a whole new zone
[25278.87s -> 25283.91s]  you almost you don't even give a shit what happened like two zones ago even though
[25283.91s -> 25291.06s]  that's important stuff going on there it's like that ant place that i just was there might be
[25291.06s -> 25296.57s]  something else there but it's like whoa look at a new pretty area i may i may as well have never
[25296.57s -> 25305.93s]  gone there to the ant place it just constantly a drip feeding new crazy places it's ridiculous
[25307.64s -> 25311.16s]  in a good way obviously not in a bad way right like in a very much a good way
[25330.98s -> 25347.69s]  germ of the ruins germ of the ruins i got him what's my take on asiago bagels um they're good
[25348.25s -> 25359.30s]  nothing wrong with them they taste good i'm gonna go over here i think i have enough to level up
[25361.10s -> 25377.99s]  i will do that this soft cap at 40 yep how do i compare this to bloodborne i kind of can't
[25378.71s -> 25389.30s]  it's uh it's actually becoming very difficult to do that for a few reasons the first most important
[25389.30s -> 25400.70s]  reason is bloodborne is a ps4 exclusive game that came out that's locked at 30 fps that was made in
[25400.70s -> 25410.06s]  2013 or 2014 or something right i mean that i consider that to be one of the best games i've
[25410.06s -> 25414.94s]  ever played in my whole life if not the best single player game i've ever played we all know
[25414.94s -> 25422.74s]  that we're all aware of that problem is this game comes out and i would say completely blows it
[25422.74s -> 25428.79s]  completely out of the water a thousand percent technically speaking it runs way better right
[25429.43s -> 25435.29s]  there's so much more to do there's so much more going on but it's like it's just it's kind of
[25435.29s -> 25442.10s]  unfair to say that because this game came out like look at eight years seven or eight years after
[25442.10s -> 25452.36s]  bloodborne did if bloodborne were to have if this was elden bloodborne right maybe i don't know
[25452.36s -> 25458.63s]  we'd be having a different question we're having a different conversation runs better yeah blood
[25458.63s -> 25465.43s]  borne was locked at 30 fps and all the time it would drop i remember that dropped down to like
[25465.43s -> 25471.77s]  25 frames a second a lot of time so it this game runs a thousand times better 2015 yeah well you
[25471.77s -> 25489.74s]  know what i mean it's been seven years since that game came out it's a shield how's this poison
[25489.74s -> 25507.80s]  build up if you attack with it oh is it alive damn what's the damage mitigation on this is
[25507.80s -> 25530.30s]  this thing's alive 100 physical guard boost yeah cool why does everything have to be alive in this
[25530.30s -> 25546.28s]  game it's kind of creepy isn't it yeah i i have already played through more areas in this game
[25546.28s -> 25554.94s]  than bloodborne times two already what is going on up here i feel like i've played through bloodborne
[25554.94s -> 25566.41s]  twice already and i'm not even like what halfway through the game why these guys electrified
[25566.41s -> 25589.80s]  it's killed each other okay well whatever i'll take it okay not even half yeah there's no way
[25589.80s -> 25596.33s]  they were not working on this game for the last like 10 years it's impossible i know that they
[25596.33s -> 25603.93s]  already had all these assets after making dark souls 3 and bloodborne and sekiro they had a
[25603.93s -> 25609.46s]  shitload of assets no fucking way this game took them three to four years to make it this game
[25609.46s -> 25614.38s]  has probably took them like seven or eight years to make it there's just too much to do there's too
[25614.38s -> 25621.40s]  much in the game there's too many things to see the game is too big you're gonna do the electric
[25621.40s -> 25634.31s]  explosion thing holy shit oh they have shields on their faces okay well let's change that then
[25634.95s -> 25683.02s]  okay can i get behind them whoa this game is worth 60 this game is worth probably
[25683.02s -> 25689.50s]  this game is worth probably 150 like this game the actual value of the video game is probably
[25689.50s -> 25703.74s]  worth like 125 dollars maybe even more this is like three video games like you're getting
[25703.74s -> 25709.27s]  all three lord of the rings movies in one game and you don't have to wait like three four years
[25709.27s -> 25714.17s]  between them like you know what they could have done and this is i'm gonna okay time to get from
[25714.17s -> 25720.84s]  software some some praise here they could have had like elden ring become like an episodic thing
[25721.72s -> 25727.88s]  right if it's like oh yeah elden ring part one we're seeing that a lot lately like oh it's like
[25727.88s -> 25733.66s]  the first part and the more will come later they could have done it in three parts they could have
[25733.66s -> 25738.78s]  done it in two parts it could have been like elden ring part one and elden ring part two
[25738.78s -> 25744.84s]  because there's that much content to do it episodic i know i say it weird
[25745.96s -> 25759.35s]  oh more stuff in the shop the whatever the dlc they do to this game is actual full-on
[25760.58s -> 25767.06s]  would be like the fourth or fifth dlc in dark souls 3 you're getting a game that has the amount
[25767.06s -> 25774.47s]  of content that would take probably five dlcs for dark souls 3 i don't even know what they're
[25774.47s -> 25785.75s]  gonna do for dlc it's already here it's already in the game i'm playing it right now final fantasy
[25785.75s -> 25791.77s]  7 remake that's a good point that's exactly kind of what i was talking about it's just
[25793.43s -> 25797.19s]  it's they they could have done that they could have actually just released it like in two or
[25797.19s -> 25809.19s]  three parts not saying the final fantasy 7 is a bad game to remake whatever it's just
[25810.15s -> 25811.35s]  i think they could have done that
[25828.12s -> 25832.04s]  final fantasy 7 remake is a bad game well i didn't say you did
[25839.45s -> 25857.38s]  i do it should i do it what do you think should i do it i'm doing it i thought those were statues
[25857.38s -> 25904.10s]  these are people they're not npcs either nox monk greaves all right so what is it what's in the
[25904.10s -> 25929.54s]  chest purple night maiden and swordstress puppets cool very cool fireplace this is literally the
[25929.54s -> 25939.00s]  area i just was looking at oh my goodness i can jump down be careful i didn't think i was gonna
[25939.00s -> 25955.64s]  be able to make that i i honest to god it's it's it's kind of bizarre to think that like what how
[25955.64s -> 25963.64s]  did they make sakiro if this was still going on i know they have two teams right who made sakiro
[25963.64s -> 25971.74s]  and who made this member it was like dark souls 2 wasn't uh oh i thought it was frozen i thought
[25971.74s -> 25991.96s]  i didn't know could come get me what the dark souls 2 team must have made sakiro that was so
[25991.96s -> 25999.66s]  much easier yeah because they had like an a team a b team and the b team would work on stuff while
[25999.66s -> 26003.83s]  the a team was working on something else all right i really hate to say a team and b team
[26003.83s -> 26007.91s]  but you know what i mean not like oh a like gray and better but like just two two teams
[26008.55s -> 26025.24s]  sakiro was still directed by miyazaki though yeah how does he have enough time to do any of this
[26026.04s -> 26031.61s]  like i'm just a streamer you know what i mean like i'll like get up in the morning
[26031.61s -> 26038.33s]  i don't know time is two o'clock i don't know what what am i doing today i got streaming
[26039.05s -> 26045.94s]  this guy's got like holy shit man the amount of work ethic and the amount of time and like
[26046.90s -> 26053.06s]  genius level iq to like have that much time and dedication and passion to do stuff like this it's
[26053.06s -> 26069.11s]  ridiculous in the morning you're still on boston time uh 2 p.m early bird yeah the early bird
[26069.11s -> 26079.98s]  special i don't know i'm at least happy that we get to experience just think about this this might
[26079.98s -> 26086.79s]  be a little sad for some of you but don't be sad it's literally probably one of the worst games
[26086.79s -> 26136.15s]  ever played i'm sad now only two hits gorsh gorsh gorsh okay so what i was gonna say
[26139.29s -> 26146.15s]  is this is gonna make people probably a little sad this these from software games have all come out
[26147.35s -> 26159.86s]  in this kind of like what like 10 like what 15 year span when did demon souls come out on ps3
[26169.67s -> 26180.87s]  2009 so it's been 12 13 years we are we are experiencing those of you that have played
[26180.87s -> 26186.01s]  these games a lot those of you that have played all of them which i have right or a lot of you
[26186.01s -> 26193.43s]  guys have to here's the generations that are coming after us because these games are so
[26193.43s -> 26199.59s]  interesting and they're so unique and they're so uniquely made and they're so weird like in
[26199.59s -> 26206.79s]  10 to 20 plus years people are going to be younger people right like in 20 years younger
[26206.79s -> 26212.95s]  people will be playing these as kind of this crazy wow well can you look at all look at how
[26212.95s -> 26217.91s]  ridiculous this was look at how much fun this was imagine like this this was coming out and
[26217.91s -> 26222.71s]  you get to play it right when it released that kind of shit right so many kids are going to be
[26222.71s -> 26226.95s]  playing this in 20 years and having those kind of conversations like the way that we have conversations
[26226.95s -> 26234.74s]  almost about like um even stuff like ocarina of time right or even before that but it's not even
[26234.74s -> 26251.18s]  the same though it's a boomer thought all right i hope i don't die that's worth it because we get
[26251.18s -> 26258.78s]  to play these as they come out and that's cool but being able to like play all the from software
[26258.78s -> 26265.26s]  games that at least since kind of the demon souls era of them making games it's going to be really
[26265.34s -> 26272.63s]  interesting because they're going to play them and what does it hate them or something like
[26272.63s -> 26276.89s]  they're going to die they're going to fall off a cliff or something and be like grandpa i don't
[26276.89s -> 26287.34s]  understand that's right you little fuck now you go back and get those souls like it's going to be
[26287.34s -> 26303.56s]  correct what if they what if this is like they think it's dumb get good grandson your grandson
[26303.56s -> 26308.71s]  died to pinwheel you'll see you can sit there and laugh all right i'm afraid to open this door but
[26308.71s -> 26343.78s]  let's do it i feel like i'm missing a potential bonfire uh-huh just electrocute yourselves to

[26426.62s -> 26455.67s]  i gotta figure out what to do with those that's the respect currency right you need a certain
[26455.67s -> 26476.57s]  amount or something i can upgrade the katana i think twice give me another bonfire or something
[26477.29s -> 26488.55s]  or a shortcut i thought it was somebody hiding waiting to ambush me i didn't know it was one of
[26488.55s -> 26521.21s]  those nice just let him have his dung it's my dung it's mine i don't know where the bonfire
[26521.21s -> 26551.32s]  do i have to actually run up here if this is a fight looks dangerous oh oh oh let's go bud
[26572.01s -> 26599.83s]  do something else do a different move did you seriously lose all right all right all right

[26683.62s -> 26705.21s]  i'm looking for versus memory slots not a big deal it's not a big deal that's all the way up
[26705.21s -> 26721.30s]  here though another way i didn't go that's the only thing that's up here not a big deal
[26721.94s -> 26748.01s]  not a big deal at all ah this way right i hear some something growling oh yeah i've guys i've
[26748.01s -> 26752.49s]  been streaming and doing youtube for over 10 years but you know that half my material is just
[26752.49s -> 26759.45s]  calling back to other things that i've done over the last 11 years we've reached that stage where
[26759.45s -> 26763.29s]  i can do a widget it's just re-reference these things that's like the whole thing now
[26764.17s -> 26777.21s]  i'm gonna get attacked by something there's a whole nother area down there
[26778.41s -> 26810.86s]  this endless content hog where am i now oh that's good oh dude where where am i now they made too
[26810.86s -> 26824.55s]  many games there's like four games in here and there's like 10 different systems my nose just
[26824.55s -> 26839.56s]  started bleeding after that okay well um i would really like a bonfire that would be amazing
[26839.56s -> 26895.03s]  actually is that what's that i'm gonna go in there you're close okay all right don't fight
[26895.03s -> 26903.56s]  the ants they're scary they actually are very much so i saw how much damage they do but did
[26903.56s -> 26914.66s]  they say how much damage that i do quite a bit i love this thing i think it's so ridiculous
[26915.38s -> 26926.47s]  this ring must be so old the elden ring and yeah probably a few thousand years old
[26927.11s -> 26947.11s]  what the bloodborne spiders those are awful as well what do you think is the scariest insect
[26947.75s -> 26962.25s]  i don't know scary like i am like irrationally afraid of this or scary like this thing is
[26962.25s -> 26971.75s]  terrifying and can like hurt people because i guess probably a centipede or something
[26972.76s -> 26978.36s]  or like a uh like a yellow jacket like hornet because hornets are just mean they're just
[26978.36s -> 27029.26s]  actually mean angry little shitheads really hey this wasn't your fight those guys suck
[27031.86s -> 27040.10s]  i wouldn't make it a day in this universe you none of us would make it a day in any of these

[27068.06s -> 27074.02s]  and that was hard hitting how do i get back here this is all the way up
[27075.74s -> 27096.06s]  holy shit um oh my fucking god this is so far away i have to run the entire thing
[27100.09s -> 27108.94s]  wait is it under here yeah it is just under here all right well i don't want to die i don't want
[27108.94s -> 27143.62s]  to lose that many souls i gotta play really passive here you look so menacing i don't like it

[28264.20s -> 28272.42s]  souls i'm not gonna use it because i think that upgrading the sword a couple times is gonna make
[28272.42s -> 28283.98s]  this fight much easier i'm also going to no yes all right that was this one here
[28285.82s -> 28296.28s]  blue cheese cheeseburger sounds good oh it is all right so now i got i'm ready to play i've
[28296.28s -> 28302.15s]  upgraded the weapon twice the little chip damage i was doing to him is now going to be
[28302.15s -> 28316.73s]  real damage and i'm going to really kill him all right let's go i am now prepared this time
[28316.73s -> 28336.15s]  let's go buddy a lot of unnecessary damage here
[28354.15s -> 28362.12s]  whoa what happened is that poison or something he's still hard to kill
[28362.76s -> 28372.39s]  there's a dot he has very varied swings but there's a lot of telegraphing on them i'll get it
[28373.11s -> 28377.19s]  he has a bleed tick oh that piece of shit all right let's go let's go
[28377.99s -> 28394.62s]  okay let me drink this too while i'm out here that will help he's got fire bleed on his sword
[28394.62s -> 28423.18s]  what a punk i'm all fucked up now again isn't that insane the first try i dodged almost every

[28447.86s -> 28454.25s]  killing me instantly it's so weird i think it's just like i just don't care right when you when
[28454.25s -> 28457.45s]  you first see a boss for the first time be like i don't give a shit if i lose or not like i who

[28518.58s -> 28531.19s]  him can i i feel like i was right behind him wait for the jump attack yeah he does like the here i
[28531.19s -> 28542.62s]  come swing and then the jump i try to get behind him well i wonder can i stagger him maybe i should
[28542.62s -> 28568.10s]  just do jump attacks i'm not gonna go for it i'll try to kill him and all right buddy that's a big
[28568.10s -> 28627.91s]  deal oh come on i thought i got around it shit he jumps fuck i thought it was a swing
[28629.11s -> 28682.34s]  fuck these stupid fucking cinder blocks in the way is the heal again that's the strat man

[29572.73s -> 29579.69s]  one in your guide i don't have i have i have not been using a guide ever the only time i used it
[29579.69s -> 29585.77s]  was when i opened it because it looked like this was going to get confusing this quest i've played
[29585.77s -> 29589.85s]  50 hours of this game without a guide we've been you and i have been talking and trying to figure
[29589.85s -> 29621.78s]  out what the fuck man where do i go i haven't even used it nobody said dude it's really cute
[29621.78s -> 29626.66s]  even you've been pretending what like you don't know where to go but we can see the reflection
[29626.66s -> 29634.81s]  of the guide on your forehead i swear to god i'm i want to experience the game
[29636.81s -> 29641.93s]  let me ask you this do you really think i'm using a guide if i didn't know what a sacred tier did
[29641.93s -> 29648.33s]  until literally yesterday do you think i'm using a guide if i didn't have the physique flask until
[29648.33s -> 29652.49s]  40 hours into the game do you think of what i'm just i don't what do you think what are
[29652.49s -> 29666.73s]  you talking about i'm dead all right i got the items over here i didn't know that sacred tears
[29666.73s -> 29677.70s]  were in churches until like seven game like 12 game hours ago you're getting a tactical advantage
[29677.70s -> 29684.50s]  all right so just tank it and run i got the items over there we're gonna go get the items over here
[29688.34s -> 29704.98s]  an item run what don't you think doesn't the rock grease just sound like a big fat guy is like
[29704.98s -> 29714.07s]  cooking food for you what's that rock grease it's healthy it's fine rock grease to me sounds like
[29714.07s -> 29719.21s]  they didn't like change the fryer later oil and i have something about it like i don't care
[29721.32s -> 29736.62s]  like that's kind of like that's weirdly appetizing to me i don't know why is that strange i don't know
[29736.62s -> 29740.22s]  like something about like oh oh like grease i don't know i don't know something about it maybe
[29740.22s -> 29750.12s]  i think that sounds good somehow in a cartoon pretend way you know what i mean i was just
[29750.12s -> 29757.14s]  just seeing if there was any items over there everyone relax you sound delirious just get to
[29757.14s -> 29763.13s]  the ball i'm i'm just telling you it's a cartoon world i'm talking about i'm not going to go put
[29763.13s -> 29770.34s]  like rot grease on my hot dog i'm not going to put rot grease on like my cheeseburger later i'm
[29770.34s -> 29775.54s]  just saying like uh grease like rot grease just sounds like something like a big fat cartoon
[29775.54s -> 29781.22s]  character would put on his hot dog and in that world in that context i'd be like it's that's
[29781.22s -> 29794.33s]  not bad wait what the fuck just happened what did i just step on i just drained the lake of rot
[29794.89s -> 29815.45s]  it's still rotted what happened i summoned platforms are they still are they going to be
[29815.45s -> 29828.74s]  there now permanently read your guide i shouldn't have even said anything because like i just
[29829.30s -> 29834.34s]  i opened it just in case like i needed it and i've never used that shit you know i've been
[29834.34s -> 29838.26s]  playing without it and stuff but like and everybody knows that we're just like hanging out
[29838.98s -> 29848.46s]  now everybody thinks i'm a guide andy and i'm not you told us not to tell online chat you
[29848.46s -> 29853.50s]  betrayed yourself but i actually haven't been using it everybody in offline chat knows i opened

[30318.31s -> 30328.34s]  like that's just not gonna happen like i don't know if i played mario golf with a bunch of other
[30328.34s -> 30335.06s]  streamers or something that might be fun but i'm not just gonna play it okay that i i think i'm
[30335.06s -> 30344.04s]  gonna die if i fall here can i even get down and how do i get down from here at least on the right
[30344.04s -> 30366.58s]  and that um how do i get down your ladder just play it alone in total silence of course you can't
[30366.58s -> 30408.17s]  summon the horse here there is a ladder this goes this way what's over here no no no no i need it i
[30408.17s -> 30488.74s]  need it i need whatever it is what was it smithing stone this way made it all right so you want me

[30503.83s -> 30511.61s]  gonna go on forever isn't it i'm not checking the guide i'm not using a guide there's an item

[30532.28s -> 30550.89s]  we're gonna do it tomorrow because it is way too late i want to go in there though real quick
[30551.53s -> 30582.63s]  just really quickly who cares if i get the rod i don't care i want to go in here all right yeah
[30582.71s -> 30589.56s]  chest right here that's so cool that key leads all the way back to that library
[30594.33s -> 30610.89s]  all right that's it i'm gonna stop it right here i'm gonna sit at the fire i'll see you guys
[30610.89s -> 30616.22s]  tomorrow i'm gonna go eat some food i'm gonna rest my voice for a little bit because it's
[30616.22s -> 30633.88s]  kind of getting a little junky i will see you guys tomorrow let me put on the credits
[30634.68s -> 30652.28s]  we're at 4 pm the pt so how i haven't really done i didn't do any of the main kind of quest
[30652.28s -> 30661.08s]  line today did i just kind of running around doing this stuff i really like this area this
[30661.08s -> 30670.12s]  is a really cool spot how much more realistically percentage wise like where am i percentage wise in
[30670.12s -> 30688.10s]  the game realistically 30 to 40 40 maybe 50 that's ridiculous you're legit like 50
[30688.98s -> 30702.74s]  that's crazy so this really is like 100 plus this is a 100 plus hour game on a first playthrough
[30702.74s -> 30714.39s]  without seeing everything that's ridiculous the game took me about 80 hours to fully explore it
[30715.03s -> 30730.20s]  i believe i'm like 48 49 hours in that's still in the 30 to 40 plus hours are you liking the
[30730.20s -> 30740.23s]  game yeah i mean i think it's it's ridiculous it's really easy to get overwhelmed but i think what
[30740.23s -> 30745.35s]  i have to start doing is i didn't do this yesterday and this is where we're gonna i did it today is
[30746.31s -> 30752.84s]  i picked four or five things that i wanted to go do specific areas i wanted to go look at
[30754.26s -> 30758.98s]  and just did those and if something led to another thing if that thing led to another thing i did
[30758.98s -> 30765.91s]  that too uh yesterday i kind of just was wandering around i got like lost and i didn't really have
[30765.91s -> 30771.21s]  any direction or anything but i uh i definitely like the idea of picking a few places to go
[30771.85s -> 30785.14s]  but yeah thanks for watching guys see you tomorrow four o'clock pacific same thing elden ring after
[30785.14s -> 30790.02s]  tomorrow's stream we're gonna have to evaluate what i want to do with this game i'm gonna have
[30790.02s -> 30798.33s]  to evaluate what the plan is because i don't want to just stream elden ring only so the stuff i'd
[30798.33s -> 30806.97s]  like to do we'll find out after tomorrow are you gonna drop it after the stream tomorrow
[30807.85s -> 30821.93s]  i don't know i don't think so i may um maybe we sprinkle in some mario golf go back to it
[30822.65s -> 30825.77s]  problem with coming back to it and this is the problem with all souls games
[30826.81s -> 30831.72s]  my fear of not playing this game for more than two or three days
[30833.32s -> 30840.25s]  coming back to this game a week or two later you just you're gonna get your ass kicked and it's
[30840.25s -> 30844.33s]  gonna be hard to get back into the swing of things to remember where anything was
[30845.29s -> 30851.37s]  to have the timings down it's it's rough to come back to a from software game
[30851.93s -> 30860.17s]  if you don't play it for like a few weeks so if i were to stop playing it every day or every stream
[30860.97s -> 30868.12s]  they would it would have to be a case of all right we're gonna do mario golf and then like
[30868.12s -> 30873.16s]  like the next day we're gonna play elden ring two days in a row right they're gonna be a lot of
[30873.24s -> 30881.72s]  streams i think for me to continue to want to play this but we'll see i mean i might just keep
[30881.72s -> 30898.55s]  going as of tomorrow as well we'll see i'll see you guys tomorrow we'll pick up right here
[30899.27s -> 30931.83s]  take care of yourselves see you guys soon have a good one really important before i go
[30932.63s -> 30946.18s]  did the frame drop stop and if they did when they kept going the whole way even up until like right
[30946.18s -> 30953.45s]  now did they actually get better or has it still been happening maybe like an hour ago
[30960.95s -> 30966.31s]  it weren't as bad as they were a few minutes ago yeah so this is definitely not an internet
[30966.31s -> 30979.38s]  problem for me yet like one o'clock in the morning no way yeah now i confirmed it a few times anyways
[30981.08s -> 30985.08s]  hopefully that whatever routing issue or server issue that's happening with twitch
[30985.08s -> 30991.50s]  i really hope that gets resolved because that would suck all right good night see you tomorrow
