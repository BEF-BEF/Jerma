[0.00s -> 14.88s]  Hey, what's happening everybody? Jerma here. Welcome to 2016. Let me be the first to welcome you to 2016.
[14.88s -> 20.69s]  First, before we get started into the top five games of 2015, I want to tell you about my new year's resolution.
[20.69s -> 29.43s]  Here we go. Here it is. It's to invent a shrink ray so I can hang out with my mice friends that are in the top five games of 2015.
[29.43s -> 33.60s]  These are the ones that I spent the most time in or the ones that I just had the most fun with.
[35.36s -> 44.42s]  Warning! This is an automated response. The Witcher 3 has not been detected on this list. Proceed with caution.
[44.42s -> 50.21s]  No, I haven't even played the game.
[59.49s -> 65.16s]  Quick little story about Undertale. I played this game for two hours and gave up.
[65.16s -> 71.16s]  I saw it as a run-of-the-mill RPG with retro-inspired graphics made by a small team.
[71.16s -> 79.16s]  It took me a good two to three weeks before I came back to it. And not because I really felt like playing Undertale, it's because I just really had nothing else to do.
[79.16s -> 84.66s]  I ended up streaming the rest of the time in the game and it was a blast. It was a ton of fun.
[84.66s -> 90.66s]  And I'm so glad that I got bored that day and decided to go back and play it because it turns out to be one of my favorite games from last year.
[90.66s -> 96.16s]  And I thought about it as to why I didn't care before and why I didn't like it, why I didn't give it a chance.
[96.16s -> 100.90s]  And it has to do with Inception. How many of you guys remember when Inception came out?
[100.90s -> 105.90s]  Everybody loved the movie and everybody was talking about it. And if you hadn't had seen Inception, people were like,
[105.90s -> 113.70s]  Whoa, wait a second. You haven't seen Inception? Oh, you got to see Inception. Just wait for that part in Inception. You ever heard of Inception?
[113.70s -> 119.20s]  And it gave this predisposed expectation of what you're supposed to expect to get from the movie.
[119.20s -> 128.44s]  Undertale is the same way. People talk a lot about this game. Even me right now, me making this video, is telling you about it and talking about it.
[128.44s -> 135.62s]  And the point I'm trying to make is just enjoy the game at your own pace. Don't listen to other people. Just forget everything I've said so far.
[135.62s -> 142.85s]  Everything. I should not have even talked about it. I didn't plan this through. Didn't think this through at all. Of course not.
[142.85s -> 150.73s]  Just pay attention to your screen right now. The mind eraser frog is going to come say hello.
[150.73s -> 155.73s]  So as I was saying, Dying Light is number five because of everything we just talked about.
[155.73s -> 163.23s]  It's got great melee mechanics. It's got a fun multiplayer mode. You can jump in, jump out with your friends. I highly recommend you check it out.
[163.23s -> 168.30s]  Number four is Metal Gear Solid V The Phantom Pain.
[168.30s -> 173.50s]  There's not much I can say about Metal Gear Solid V that hasn't already been said by everybody.
[174.00s -> 185.00s]  So know that it's a fantastic open world third person shooter with stealth tactics, but also know it's one of the greatest, if not the only, human being collection simulators.
[185.00s -> 192.08s]  I think the Fulton device might be more fun for me than the actual Metal Gear Solid V campaign.
[192.08s -> 201.58s]  Something about scoping people out, seeing what they're good at, sending them back to Mother Base, doing staff allocation and moving people around and oh these guys got in a fight, gotta move these guys around.
[201.58s -> 204.58s]  It was a very, very itchy, itchy, scratchy game.
[204.58s -> 212.08s]  Now, I have not yet finished this game. I actually didn't start playing this game until 2016, about a week ago.
[212.08s -> 221.64s]  So technically, it's not even allowed to be on this list because I need to follow my own rules and I had to at least have started playing the game in 2015.
[221.64s -> 233.55s]  So unfortunately, I'm gonna have to disqualify Metal Gear Solid V fucking up this whole list. Can I get anything right the first time?
[233.55s -> 236.74s]  Hold on, just take a look at this frog for a second.
[236.74s -> 240.60s]  Hey, you're on a boat. You're on a boat and it's a nice day.
[240.60s -> 245.10s]  There's a southeastern wind that comes by, catches right in the cheek. You breathe in the fresh sea air.
[245.10s -> 252.10s]  You go home, you had a great time when you were there. That was what you just were doing and it reminded you of just how bad Raven's Cry sucked.
[252.10s -> 256.10s]  And you wanted to disqualify it and that's exactly what we just did.
[256.10s -> 263.10s]  Currently making our Games of the Year for 2015 list and what a great idea that was that you had. What a fantastic suggestion that you gave me there.
[263.60s -> 268.60s]  Yeah, I'm feeling a little bit sick too. I'm a little queasy as well. It's probably something that we ate. We probably ate the same thing.
[268.60s -> 270.60s]  But don't worry about that. It'll probably pass.
[270.60s -> 275.93s]  Let's move on. We've already talked about this. We can go to number four now on the list.
[275.93s -> 283.87s]  And it's Victor Vran. Victor Vran is one of those games that I wish the developers had a hundred million more dollars.
[283.87s -> 288.87s]  Because the base game is so good and there's so many great ideas in this game.
[289.37s -> 296.37s]  If I won that Powerball, like I'll give you a real scenario here. If I won the 1.6 billion dollar Powerball, whatever the hell it was,
[296.37s -> 302.37s]  I would have like wrote a blank check to these guys and then like make another one of these games and make it like 50 times bigger.
[302.37s -> 307.87s]  Here's a fucking billion dollars. But I didn't win the Powerball so I can't do that.
[307.87s -> 315.30s]  But the point still stands. The genre of action RPGs, especially top-down ones, really needed a breath of fresh air.
[315.80s -> 322.73s]  Victor Vran is that air. There's a combat role in this game. There's a wall jump.
[322.73s -> 329.73s]  There's a deck building progression system where you craft cards together and collect different types of cards and put them in the slots down here.
[329.73s -> 334.03s]  It was a bunch of new ideas. And I just wish I could have seen it more fleshed out.
[334.03s -> 342.64s]  But what was there was really good. I just hope they made enough money from this game to potentially do another one or a sequel.
[343.14s -> 348.14s]  Maybe not Victor Vran 2 because we've already seen a handful of Hellsing inspired RPGs.
[348.14s -> 354.14s]  I'd rather see a different setting or a different story or something. But whatever, who doesn't like slaying monsters?
[354.14s -> 356.76s]  You know what I mean? Who doesn't like killing monsters?
[356.76s -> 360.77s]  So that wraps up this one. Here comes number three, Card Crawl.
[360.77s -> 367.95s]  I was pretty reluctant to put this on the list because it's a mobile game. iPad, Android, iPhone, that type of deal.
[367.95s -> 373.70s]  So just give me ten seconds, ten seconds, ten seconds of your time. That's all I ask for.
[374.20s -> 379.63s]  Take all the games that I've talked about so far. Take the amount of playtime I have in them.
[379.63s -> 384.63s]  I would not be surprised if I had at least half that amount of time in Card Crawl.
[384.63s -> 393.32s]  The game is fun. You play against a deck of 54 cards and it's three bucks. There's no in-app purchases. The game's really...
[393.32s -> 401.18s]  Look at this frog. Look at the frog. What? Is that a battery? Does it even take batteries?
[401.68s -> 406.68s]  No, people are going to remember this. How do I get out of this? How do I get out of this?
[406.68s -> 410.63s]  Witcher 3 is number two. Yep.
[410.63s -> 418.63s]  Congratulations. This list has officially been approved for viewing. Please have a nice rest of your day.
[418.63s -> 426.04s]  Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate it. Witcher 3 is number two. That's it. And Bloodborne is number one.
[426.04s -> 433.50s]  Not only is Bloodborne my favorite game from last year, it might even be one of my favorite single player games
[433.50s -> 442.00s]  I've ever played. I seriously cannot remember the last time I put more than 120 to 150 hours into a single player game.
[442.00s -> 448.30s]  I gotta go back at least two decades, guys. Remember, I'm like 40. But this game sucked me in. Big time.
[448.30s -> 454.30s]  I was really into this game for a period. I've read an entire 110 page thesis statement about this game.
[454.30s -> 459.48s]  And I loved every second of it. The game's combat, the story, the atmosphere, the art direction.
[459.48s -> 466.22s]  Literally everything about this game, I adore. The only issue I have with it is that everybody can't play it.
[466.22s -> 472.40s]  I so badly want people that don't have PS4s to be able to enjoy this game. But at the time of this recording,
[472.40s -> 477.64s]  it does not look like it's coming to PC or Xbox One, at least for the foreseeable future.
[477.64s -> 483.00s]  Besides that, it gets two thumbs up from me. You know when you play a game and you say to yourself,
[483.00s -> 487.18s]  man, I wish I could just go back and like relive that experience for the first time?
[487.18s -> 493.18s]  There was some way that I could wipe my memory and play this game again and enjoy it like it was the first time playing it.
[493.18s -> 498.68s]  Holy shit.
[498.68s -> 503.68s]  I'm not getting into another argument with somebody from tech support. You're the third person I've been transferred to.
[503.68s -> 509.18s]  I have a warranty and I need to recalibrate my mind eraser frog. Is it that hard to understand?
[509.18s -> 518.90s]  Maybe six or seven thousand times over the course of a few years. Not supposed to do it that many times.
[518.90s -> 523.90s]  Okay, well you work for the company that makes these, so you're like kind of preaching to the choir here.
[526.49s -> 532.90s]  Underneath? Yeah. I'm looking at it right now. What's the purpose of...
[532.90s -> 538.90s]  I want to go back, I've said it four times now, I want to go back and play Bloodborne and experience it for the first time.
[538.90s -> 545.43s]  It's the game of the year.
[547.43s -> 552.86s]  You think that's a better game than Bloodborne. Well, good to know they transferred me to a fucking idiot.
[552.86s -> 561.31s]  Okay, no, no, no. It's not better than Bloodborne. Look, we have differing opinions, whatever. I'm sorry, just forget it.
[561.31s -> 569.86s]  How do I fix it? The button underneath, there's, I see it, yes. Hold it for four seconds.
[569.86s -> 571.92s]  Now, is there something?
[571.92s -> 575.98s]  Oh, you piece of shit, that was fucking dastardly!
[588.31s -> 601.08s]  Hello? Oh, I'm sorry to bother you. Yeah, I did call to tell you that Fallout 4 was the best game of the year.
