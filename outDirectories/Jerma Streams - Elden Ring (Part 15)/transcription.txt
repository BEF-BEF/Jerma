[5.05s -> 9.53s]  He goes, hey, what's up? How are you? Good to see you.
[12.63s -> 15.05s]  How's everybody doing? I don't know what you're doing. All right.
[15.77s -> 21.08s]  Just sending out a tweet. Sorry, I'm late. Yeah, whatever. You know what? I'm not even gonna say
[21.08s -> 29.26s]  that anymore. I'm not even gonna say that anymore. Do I? Okay. If you're late every day, are you late?
[30.14s -> 32.10s]  Are you just a piece of shit?
[38.92s -> 42.44s]  Oh, sorry, I'm late. Oh, hey, I'm late. Oh, hey, I'm late. Oh, hey, I'm late today. Hey, sorry,
[42.44s -> 47.00s]  I'm late today. Hey, I'm late. Oh, hey, I'm late today. At what point you're not late?
[47.00s -> 61.58s]  You're just a dick. I'm not a dick though. For God's sake, what? No, I'd rather look, I'm gonna take
[62.22s -> 73.29s]  the incredible wisdom of Nintendo. Somebody at Nintendo once said, I would delay the fucking
[73.29s -> 78.73s]  game three more times if I knew it was going to be a better video game when it released,
[79.29s -> 86.02s]  when kids got their hands on it, right? Somebody said that at Nintendo. What's going on? Why is
[86.02s -> 102.31s]  my voice like this? Why? Whatever. I would rather be live when I'm ready than turn the stream on,
[102.31s -> 110.54s]  not be ready, have a little bit of a headache, sit there and go, oh, oh, my head. And everyone's
[110.54s -> 116.07s]  like, oh, his head. And I'm like, oh, ow, ow, ow. For like 30 minutes. No, I'm gonna stream when
[116.07s -> 131.75s]  I'm ready. And you know what I noticed? Since streaming, since going back to, when I say back,
[131.75s -> 137.11s]  I mean, since going down to like two days a week, obviously Elden Ring was a lot different,
[137.11s -> 142.31s]  right? Because I was streaming that a lot more. But since doing two to three days a week, like one
[142.31s -> 148.87s]  to two days a week sometimes, right? I feel like I haven't seen you guys in a while. So I just
[149.43s -> 153.35s]  absolutely unload on you with just weird stuff that I've like thought of in the last like five
[153.35s -> 163.80s]  days. I think that's why the streams have gotten odder in the last like year. Because there's way
[163.80s -> 168.76s]  more stuff for me to say to you. And there was, you know, if I were to stream every single day,
[169.72s -> 175.88s]  I wouldn't have had that Dunkin Donuts drive through scenario, right? Maybe I would have,
[175.88s -> 183.64s]  but it wouldn't have been as in the front of the head. Because you lost your mind. No, I'm just
[183.64s -> 186.68s]  messing around. You guys know that. Hi, how are you? Welcome to the stream. Today we're gonna play
[186.68s -> 195.05s]  Elden Ring. Not regular Elden Ring. We're gonna do multiplayer. I'm gonna start, we're gonna do
[195.05s -> 203.34s]  some invasions. We're gonna pick a spot somewhere. I'm gonna put a sign down. Or you'll put a sign
[203.34s -> 210.41s]  down and then we'll have a group password. We'll do some PvP. Maybe we'll do some summoning. If
[210.41s -> 216.15s]  you're having trouble with the boss. Hey, maybe I might help you kill Godric. That's very possible.
[216.95s -> 225.59s]  What system? This is on PC. I'm not going to tell you anything yet because I don't want...
[226.31s -> 232.57s]  Okay, here's why I don't want to tell everybody what the information is. I think I'd rather just
[232.57s -> 239.21s]  slowly trickle in because I don't want like 5,000 people to all put their sign down right now
[240.09s -> 252.22s]  in the same spot. So just hold on. You have multiple characters for certain levels. No,
[252.22s -> 258.46s]  unfortunately I have one character that's 153 and then me strong who is level 10.
[260.30s -> 268.79s]  So I'm gonna be playing with this character. Just use a password. Levels don't matter.
[277.94s -> 282.50s]  Well, here's the thing. I'm not gonna do like just PvP only. I want to do like some invasions
[282.50s -> 294.98s]  and stuff. But that's the plan. We're just gonna play. We're just gonna hang out. Tomorrow,
[295.86s -> 304.17s]  I'll be live tomorrow. We're not playing Elden Ring. Tomorrow we're gonna do DOS games. I'm gonna
[304.17s -> 317.05s]  grab a bunch of random stuff. Play for a few hours. That's tomorrow. This is today. If anybody has
[317.05s -> 321.13s]  any recommendations for DOS games, please put them in the recommendation channel in the Discord.
[323.08s -> 331.93s]  Uh, we've played a lot already. Bringing this back. I used to do this. I've done this probably
[331.93s -> 340.86s]  like five to ten times. Maybe total. So we have done a lot already. It's gonna be really hard
[340.86s -> 345.74s]  for me to remember what those are. So we're gonna... I will collectively have a pretty decent list
[345.74s -> 353.88s]  tomorrow. But I might pop in to the Discord and ask a few questions. All right, let me just tweet.
[353.88s -> 423.66s]  I'll be right back. We'll get started. It just took me so long to do that. Yeah, I'll get around
[423.66s -> 432.55s]  to the BTTV emotes. I know. Oh yeah, I'll get around to that. Oh, yeah. You know what? I've
[432.55s -> 441.10s]  been kind of... Oh yeah, no, I'll get around to it. Yeah, me strong will take care of that.
[444.07s -> 448.79s]  All right, let's go. It took me so long to tweet that. Why? Why did that take so long?
[448.79s -> 455.35s]  That should have been so quick. I just had to look at the keyboard. I actually, honest to God,
[455.35s -> 461.85s]  I'm not kidding. I just said, all right guys, I'm gonna go tweet. I'll be right back. Let's tweet.
[462.81s -> 474.25s]  I went like this. I was just looking at my keyboard. What the fuck happened? I was just
[474.25s -> 477.61s]  looking. I was just like, oh, that's... I'm gonna look at the keyboard for like 10 to 15 straight
[477.61s -> 487.48s]  seconds. All right. Hi. Welcome to another stream. Today, I'm gonna be summoning people in PvP.
[487.48s -> 493.32s]  This is not where I'm doing this, by the way. I'm not doing it here. I know that I'm gonna look down
[493.32s -> 499.00s]  and it's gonna be like... I'm not... Don't. Stop. I'm not doing it here. See? There's already one
[499.00s -> 506.38s]  right there. I'm not gonna use the katana. Maybe I will. I don't know. You guys see? Okay. How many
[506.38s -> 510.38s]  rivers of bloods are we gonna see in the first 30 minutes? I didn't even tell you what we were
[510.38s -> 517.75s]  doing yet. Here's what I'm doing. I want to start because... Let me get the hang of this first. Let
[517.75s -> 525.96s]  me like figure out how this works. I'm gonna do some invasions. I'm gonna try to invade somebody's
[525.96s -> 537.70s]  game. Where should I do this? Rest till night at this bonfire. Is there a place that I should do
[537.70s -> 552.01s]  this? I feel like I want to do it somewhere weird. Go to the mountaintops. Why rest till nightfall
[552.01s -> 566.20s]  here? Is there where I get invaded? At the divine bridge? This is like a perfect knot. Rest again.
[567.42s -> 574.42s]  Rest again and walk to the shack. Hold on. I love how I'm still... I like beat the game and I kind
[574.42s -> 578.82s]  of finished the actual kind of campaign of the game. I love how people are like, all right dude,
[578.82s -> 583.22s]  rest at that bonfire. Wake up. Take 10 steps forward. Take 10 steps backward. Look at the
[583.22s -> 587.94s]  ground. Look at the sky. Swing once and a boss appears. I don't... What's he... What am I even
[587.94s -> 608.31s]  doing? I'm supposed to be invading? Okay, now walk to the shack. Bell Bearing Hunter. What happened
[608.31s -> 616.36s]  to this weapon? Oh, this is fucking hard. Dude, it's so cool. They added like a boss bar for PvP
[616.36s -> 621.08s]  encounters. That's so cool. That's awesome. I'd say they should have added that a long time ago.
[621.08s -> 632.33s]  That's a cool move. Where'd you get this weapon? Also something finally added. Thank God. It's
[632.41s -> 641.74s]  being able to scale your player model and stuff. Like, bigger head, bigger arms. Nice. Okay, they
[641.74s -> 651.02s]  can kill the NPCs in a bit. I don't even have two headphones in. This doesn't count.
[652.06s -> 661.93s]  Oh, now I'm not supposed to drink. I know. Whatever. All right, stop with the fucking
[661.93s -> 683.38s]  PvP joke. Just kill this boss. This guy's easy. Get in! Stop respawning. Oh my God. All right,
[683.38s -> 693.29s]  this is not supposed to be a game where I play Elden Ring. I'm supposed to be PvPing. I'm stuck
[693.29s -> 735.40s]  in the tree. Thank you. Yeah! How come you look like you're 17? Because I moisturize every day.
[735.40s -> 746.38s]  I'm gonna have youthful skin for the rest of my life. Like, internet just freeze. What was that?
[746.38s -> 768.82s]  That was weird. All right, I'll kill this guy. I'll kill this guy. This isn't Fortnite. Okay,
[768.82s -> 772.50s]  come on. Now I know what's happening. Wait, is he gone? Why is he not here?
[774.84s -> 778.92s]  Okay. All right, I'm not playing Elden Ring anymore. I'm playing Elden Ring PvP. They're
[778.92s -> 784.52s]  two separate clients. Two separate EXE files. I shouldn't even be seeing these enemies. It's
[784.52s -> 791.34s]  ridiculous. Okay, so here's where I'm gonna go. Beat him first. Fine. All right, I'll beat him.
[792.14s -> 836.07s]  I got it. I got it. I beat him. I was here for like four hours. I was here for like four hours.
[836.71s -> 843.00s]  Medicine peddler's bell bearing. All right, cool. I beat it. There we go. All right,
[843.00s -> 847.48s]  I'm not gonna use the moon veil in PvP. I'm not gonna do the thing that everybody thinks I'm gonna
[847.48s -> 854.17s]  do. Here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna use the baby rattle. It's gonna be people are not used to
[854.17s -> 861.51s]  fighting the baby rattle. All right, so let's go. Are you ready? I'm gonna I'm just gonna invade
[861.51s -> 872.15s]  somebody. Just right here. Can I invade somebody here? I just want to see how this works. That's
[872.15s -> 899.66s]  a summon set. Now here we go. Attempts invasion of other players world. Yeah. Phantom bloody finger.
[899.66s -> 921.34s]  Okay, now what? All right, I gotta kill this person. How come they're not on the minimap?
[921.34s -> 934.52s]  Where are they? This be anywhere? Oh, they are in the mini. They are on the minimap.
[934.52s -> 964.18s]  No, they're not. Wait, what? Do you see me? This guy afk. Let's get the shit out of this guy. Oh,
[964.18s -> 973.35s]  fuck. I scared him. I scared the shit out of him. Never seen a baby rattling PvP. Have you?
[980.87s -> 994.49s]  Fine. I'll do it too. Two sorcerers back to back. He's being a weirdo. He's being a weirdo. He's
[994.49s -> 1010.06s]  being a weirdo. Wait, who's? Wait, there's a is that a go to guy? Why? Who is this?

[1048.22s -> 1066.90s]  he just baseball swung me to midair. How come I don't get a tag team partner? Oh, I got him.
[1066.90s -> 1078.74s]  Now what? Now what? Now what do we do? Do I have to fight him too? Whoa, I did it. I kind of feel
[1078.74s -> 1085.08s]  bad though. That like, that's annoying. I kind of feel bad. Like that person was just afk. Like
[1085.08s -> 1101.94s]  hanging out. The person probably, what did they lose their souls? They do. I feel, I feel kind of
[1101.94s -> 1111.77s]  bad. That was fun though. I don't know why that was fun. They're five feet from the grace and
[1111.77s -> 1116.73s]  it's fine. That's true. Oh, so what I can do that anywhere. I've never done PvP in any of the souls
[1116.73s -> 1127.19s]  games ever. So I can just do that anywhere in the whole world. What's a weird place that no one would
[1127.75s -> 1145.64s]  ever invade you at like a front door LB on the map. What is this? What is this?
[1148.07s -> 1167.45s]  Multiplayer status. This is where people are hot spots. Oh, for Dan swamp. That is kind of a weird
[1167.45s -> 1173.40s]  place. Or what about the, I mean, the front door actually has a lot of, uh, activity. What about
[1173.40s -> 1183.10s]  like over here? Like in right in front of the divine tower of limb grip fight them on the elevator.
[1183.10s -> 1203.02s]  Here we go. Oh, I can't use it here. The guy was an afk. He was waiting for me. He was hot spots.
[1203.66s -> 1210.36s]  Why? I repeat. Well, well, that was kind of fun. I'll do it again. How about just over here? Whatever
[1210.36s -> 1218.79s]  right here. Doesn't work in all areas. Okay. He used the taunter's tongue. Lunaria is full of
[1218.79s -> 1226.57s]  tryhards. So is this sectioned off to kind of like skill level? Lunaria is for the tryhards.
[1227.51s -> 1230.15s]  Limgrave is for the people that don't even understand the mechanic is in the game.
[1230.79s -> 1236.54s]  Kaylet is for people that want the like kind of animated background, like in street fighter.
[1237.10s -> 1242.76s]  The capital are for people that said, look how far I've come in the game so far. And like, I'm like,
[1242.76s -> 1247.32s]  look, I'm at the capital. I played the game for a while and the mountains is nobody cares because
[1247.32s -> 1254.28s]  nobody plays. Nobody wants to be here. Right. I look at how far I made it into the game.
[1254.84s -> 1261.67s]  It's based on your level. Oh, Oh, let's just do it right here. Whatever. I have like, I got a shit
[1261.67s -> 1274.65s]  load of these. Let's go festering bloody finger. Let's use it. Invasions are one V two.
[1276.81s -> 1289.42s]  Did it work? I didn't even look. Did I teleport? Cancel. Oh, it's not doing it.
[1290.14s -> 1301.82s]  You can only evade people who are in co-op. You can one V one viewers by making a password for us
[1301.82s -> 1309.61s]  and put them down the duelist sign. Like what's going on here? Well, go do something so I can
[1309.61s -> 1315.05s]  invade you. Oh, there's nobody around there. Okay. There is somebody around there right there.
[1315.77s -> 1325.26s]  No one is here. God damn it. All right. How about like, how about like the cat? Yeah. People will
[1325.26s -> 1333.03s]  be like right here. Right? Yeah. Get a fight club going. I just turned. I just started.
[1333.03s -> 1336.79s]  Relax. I don't, I'm not going to start the fight club before I even know how to
[1336.79s -> 1349.62s]  PVP everybody. This is a good place. Uh, Ray Lucario game is good for PVP.
[1350.34s -> 1377.30s]  Let me do it. I want to do some more invasions. People play this game. The Hallux. Oh, oh, oh,
[1377.30s -> 1391.53s]  oh, oh, oh, it's a dead game. All right. Here we go. I should dress like a weirdo, right?
[1392.25s -> 1428.60s]  All right. Make them think I'm fucking lagging. What was that move?
[1428.60s -> 1431.72s]  Starlight. Oh, that was a bad idea. I was going to do this. Freak them out.
[1432.28s -> 1445.05s]  What the fuck just happened to me? Oh, what? That tracks. How much does that track? Oh my God.
[1445.05s -> 1468.44s]  I'm going to get embarrassed. I got him. Nice job. GG. What happened? So I should, I should dress up
[1468.44s -> 1479.40s]  as the baby then. I would be furious right now. That person had 15 bigger.
[1480.04s -> 1493.82s]  Okay. Why did I, why did that, why did they die? I hit them with the swing for the baby rattle.
[1494.38s -> 1498.38s]  That hits. Then the explosion hits. And then like a second later, he would hurt them.
[1498.38s -> 1506.79s]  That was weird. All right. Cool. I actually kind of like this. It's fun.
[1510.38s -> 1516.38s]  You played the entire game without following up an L2. Um, maybe rattle does not have an L2 follow
[1516.38s -> 1524.14s]  up. Everybody scream. No L2 follow up. No L2 follow up. No L2 follow up. No R2 follow up.
[1524.62s -> 1538.01s]  Look, no R2 follow up. No L2 follow up. No R2 follow up. No L2 follow up. And by the way,
[1538.01s -> 1542.09s]  the person that said that you have to understand, I played the first like 50 hours of this game
[1542.09s -> 1550.28s]  without the flask of wondrous physique. I mean, there's that I'm, I have a tendency.
[1552.10s -> 1556.06s]  How much is like right in front of the ear tree? Kind of fun. Like at the throne. Yeah.
[1556.86s -> 1572.42s]  Let's do it right here. And let me change my outfit because who cares about actually winning games.
[1573.06s -> 1577.56s]  Let's make ourselves just look like scary and weird and creepy.
[1578.28s -> 1607.32s]  Yeah. I'm going to be an assassin. Hmm. There we go. Big oven mitts and mushroom legs.
[1608.04s -> 1621.48s]  Oh, that's ugly. There you go. I just put on like a boxing glove and go punch people.
[1622.04s -> 1635.29s]  I just want to walk around with two shields. That'd be fun. All right. Uh, where's the katana?
[1635.85s -> 1645.24s]  I just want it in one hand and I want a parrying dagger in the left hand. I want people to think
[1645.24s -> 1649.82s]  like, Oh, God damn it. Do I really have to fight against this fucking, this guy's just going to
[1649.82s -> 1664.41s]  try hard the whole time. Where's, uh, where is it? Here you go. Even if it doesn't work, I don't,
[1664.41s -> 1670.14s]  it doesn't need to work. It just needs to look like I'm trying to do that. Yeah. Like right here.
[1675.00s -> 1678.84s]  Yeah. I want people to be like, Oh, come on, man. Really? I'm going to start like this.
[1681.67s -> 1684.07s]  They'll think you're trying to use moon bill. All right. Here we go.
[1684.95s -> 1691.48s]  You can't do it here. You can't do it on the throne. Huh? What about just like here means bed
[1691.48s -> 1701.72s]  chamber. What I want to, whoever I invade right now as the, I'm the moon veil, try hard guy.
[1702.74s -> 1706.02s]  I want to make, here's what, here's the ultimate. We're going to make somebody's day
[1706.58s -> 1710.36s]  because I'm going to come in there and I'm going to make sure that I lose.
[1711.22s -> 1717.54s]  So that person fucking jumps up in their chair and they're like, yes, like new piece of shit.
[1717.54s -> 1733.46s]  See, like I beat you. I want to make sure that they think that. So let's do it. I've even,
[1733.46s -> 1746.39s]  how long have you been drinking matcha for? Um, not that long. Don't pander to the three V ones.
[1747.98s -> 1757.98s]  Wait, there's a, what started fighting the boss? Oh, that's unfortunate. That's so funny.
[1757.98s -> 1760.94s]  Get me in there. I'm going to hopefully find somebody that's about to go in the boss door.
[1761.98s -> 1775.78s]  I want to stand in front of the boss door. That was a waste of a finger.
[1775.78s -> 1797.94s]  That should return it to you. That's not fair. And I got a bow too, right? Oh, moon veil. Oh God.
[1798.90s -> 1830.86s]  Oh, here we go. A bit of menacing. I am. They're talking. They're in a discord call right now
[1830.86s -> 1838.66s]  going like, man, I, people, people just net decking. Yeah. Nice net deck kid.
[1838.66s -> 1843.78s]  That's what they both are saying right now. All right. This time I'm actually going to try it.
[1843.78s -> 1860.66s]  I'm going to make somebody angry. No, they're saying what the fuck was that? I'm going to
[1860.66s -> 1878.73s]  actually try this one. I'm going to, I'm going to be the moon veil guy was going to the boss door.
[1881.67s -> 1895.85s]  Damn it. Shit. I wanted to backstab them so bad. I will go off and backstab somebody at this box.
[1895.85s -> 1898.73s]  I'm wasting fingers. Whatever. I can buy them from merchants. Who cares?
[1900.60s -> 1904.60s]  Invade away from the boss. I want to go up there and I want to, I want to scare the shit out of
[1904.60s -> 1909.64s]  somebody. Why would you ever get invaded here? Right? Like dude, there's no, like what a shitty
[1909.64s -> 1918.49s]  place to fight. First of all, people are just walking into this boss door. The recusant finger
[1918.49s -> 1923.85s]  is infinite. Okay. I got to get up there quick. They're going in. They're going to go, go, go,
[1923.85s -> 1937.43s]  go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Quickly. All right. Do I have any? There's
[1937.43s -> 1945.78s]  anything what's really long range a bow and arrow. Right? Could I like shoot him with a bow? Like
[1945.78s -> 1964.25s]  should I turn instantly and shoot the bow just like a bow? No. Use a great bow. Can I even hold
[1964.25s -> 1974.47s]  a great bow? I'm an Azure with a common I common. As they're my take too long. Use the red as a bow
[1974.47s -> 1981.74s]  And I does that go actually go that far? How annoying is that? I don't okay
[1981.74s -> 1985.70s]  I don't also don't want to be annoying the whole time. I want to see if this works
[2000.42s -> 2002.99s]  Invasions are always annoying
[2002.99s -> 2017.00s]  Invading is inherently annoying. Am I being annoying? You don't have a staff equipped. Oh god damn it
[2041.45s -> 2047.79s]  That would be so scary, I don't think anyone expects it and you know, somebody invaded
[2047.79s -> 2049.59s]  Oh, I wonder they're probably far away
[2049.59s -> 2053.03s]  I'm just at the bottom of the stairs put the fucking staff on dude. What a waste of
[2053.63s -> 2061.26s]  If this works, this is so stupid. I hate this. Okay, here we go
[2061.70s -> 2065.14s]  So just use the other finger. Is there any
[2066.17s -> 2068.69s]  Benefit to using this one that I had because I have them
[2069.13s -> 2073.68s]  Is there any reason to ever use these ever is it the exact same thing?
[2074.24s -> 2083.19s]  Use the taunter's tongue. I'm currently invading the exact same. Okay, see if I can do it
[2102.99s -> 2104.99s]  I
[2105.23s -> 2133.29s]  Am I up here? Is that the person? Oh shit. I got moved. Oh shit
[2136.15s -> 2145.59s]  Let's work. What's that? Why did he fall down?
[2162.18s -> 2215.99s]  Stop oh my goodness
[2217.59s -> 2222.14s]  No, I'm trying to kill him in one hit
[2222.58s -> 2239.52s]  What that was such a good fight? What the fuck? That was such a great fight. What happened? It didn't rage quit
[2273.87s -> 2276.46s]  Okay, I kind of like that. Let's go
[2281.82s -> 2283.82s]  Like what kind of stat combination is this?
[2283.98s -> 2301.76s]  Also, I want this person to be like, I don't know what the fuck's going on this guy
[2301.76s -> 2315.06s]  But I'm gonna like just pretend like I'm gonna walk around like my connection is bad. Wait, they're not here yet
[2315.54s -> 2335.43s]  shit
[2336.39s -> 2339.81s]  You can jump over the railing I think you can jump over the railing
[2340.55s -> 2352.20s]  You can jump over that railing. Oh, you know how I know that because I've seen speedrunners that do that
[2352.20s -> 2354.50s]  I just not whatever
[2357.59s -> 2367.52s]  Imagine somebody getting in there. He's invade someone else. I'm not invading the same person
[2369.51s -> 2377.54s]  Hotkey my beloved Omega. Well, he thinks he can God free skip
[2377.54s -> 2386.15s]  Nobody thought I could I will skip and I didn't two tries and I just want to so badly just be the boss
[2386.15s -> 2388.15s]  I want to be standing there when they get there
[2388.55s -> 2395.34s]  All right. I'll go in somewhere else. I'm going somewhere else. Fine. God damn it. All right, where's the where's the uh,
[2396.30s -> 2408.46s]  Activity, why is there a lot of activity inside of these dungeons? That's kind of weird the top like the mountaintop
[2413.33s -> 2415.81s]  Do the main gate at Ray Lucario?
[2417.54s -> 2430.08s]  Let's just try here. Whatever. I'm having fun doing invasions. Oh fire mazula. That's right
[2430.20s -> 2442.95s]  You should skip 48 minutes of waters. Why I'm invading I'm having fun getting invaded in the dungeons actually pretty cool
[2443.47s -> 2485.42s]  All right. Where are you? Can I get on horse here? See me? Oh, yeah, let's get this shit out of somebody
[2489.88s -> 2493.11s]  What
[2493.15s -> 2504.98s]  Why did mine go into the ground what the fuck is happening with these people get away from me
[2510.48s -> 2511.44s]  shit
[2511.44s -> 2518.11s]  Why?
[2518.11s -> 2520.47s]  Why did my beam go?
[2520.99s -> 2530.82s]  Two inches in front of me and do nothing. I did the beam and it went this far. What happened?
[2530.82s -> 2544.88s]  I want it. I want to kill up against those people again. You aimed it at the ground
[2544.88s -> 2551.50s]  I was targeting somebody you hit the rock in front of you. I didn't know that there was a madness beam
[2552.06s -> 2591.18s]  See them right there like I don't see him. What the fuck is he doing?
[2607.87s -> 2609.87s]  Hope you have fucked now
[2614.62s -> 2620.81s]  Stayed next to this thing. This is so unfair
[2621.33s -> 2653.62s]  Am I hitting him shit? Is it my just cheap? Oh, he killed it. Fuck. Oh my god. I didn't get okay
[2653.62s -> 2662.82s]  I honestly didn't think he killed it. I was I don't know what I was doing. I don't understand what happened
[2662.82s -> 2665.70s]  I I was like, I didn't think he was gonna kill that thing
[2665.98s -> 2670.34s]  But then I forgot that like other players probably don't think that the hand is that big of a deal
[2670.34s -> 2677.66s]  I was like just watching him fight it. All right, no more messing around like I'm not gonna like Oh cutesy
[2677.66s -> 2683.76s]  Look, I'm not gonna attack you. I'm gonna pretend like I have a connection problem. Oh, I have an idea
[2683.76s -> 2690.13s]  Let me invade somebody and pretend I have a connection problem and then they kill me great fucking fantastic. I'm killing this person
[2690.37s -> 2743.43s]  Here we go. I'm running another cooperator. Where are they? I'm not since in any movement. I'm gonna get sniped use the compass
[2743.59s -> 2744.51s]  Oh

[2755.92s -> 2784.53s]  Where are they at them a person tried to summon a friend it didn't work. That's not them. Is that them?
[2784.81s -> 2819.62s]  No, there's inside the building it below you. How do I get over there? Oh, that's unfortunate
[2820.06s -> 2831.86s]  You'd reinvade with finger. I'll try this one more time. I'm gonna go somewhere else. I actually think this is really fun
[2831.86s -> 2842.25s]  No, I love this at a password. We will we will I just want to invade. Well, actually
[2843.01s -> 2852.90s]  Does the password do invasions thought that was just for what was that? The password doesn't work for
[2853.54s -> 2871.65s]  Invasions does it? Okay down here. Is this the same thing? Are they underneath me like all the way?
[2872.25s -> 2882.69s]  Are they actually here? Why does it keep putting me up there? Yeah, what?
[2882.69s -> 2886.01s]  No, I promise we will do I will you guys can put your signs down and I'll bring you in
[2886.53s -> 2891.11s]  Alright, and well, I want to some cooperative stuff, too. I want to like have people summon me to help fight

[3000.50s -> 3009.38s]  What's that person doing? This guy's probably pissed. What the fuck is happening?

[3110.56s -> 3113.28s]  Invaded a player that player
[3114.16s -> 3121.21s]  Asked two other players for help. I killed one of those helpers as an afk
[3121.65s -> 3128.10s]  One of those helpers invaded that game and killed everybody in one swing
[3128.54s -> 3133.46s]  That invader was your teammate. Why was I dead? Well, he killed me in one hit
[3136.38s -> 3140.96s]  Invaded the host you got a helper but friendly fire is on. So did we win?
[3141.60s -> 3145.18s]  Did we did we beat it?

[3156.90s -> 3167.68s]  That guy came in and just waved a magic wand and killed everybody. What the hell was that?
[3168.36s -> 3173.10s]  Like I was a referee. That wasn't even a player. He just came in and like he blew a whistle. We all stopped

[3249.28s -> 3269.40s]  Spike that's not an accurate cosplay and also doesn't have a tabard. That was so funny, though. I almost beat him
[3269.92s -> 3284.45s]  You know what? I want to do so bad. I just want to freak somebody out like crazy
[3284.45s -> 3287.95s]  I want to just jump from here and land in front of them and die
[3288.19s -> 3291.23s]  Maybe like where did they come from? Why did they just fall? Are they all right?
[3291.83s -> 3313.48s]  They right there. Is that them sitting right there? That's a fault. I mean, I'm gonna try. I don't know. That's a marionette
[3313.84s -> 3317.30s]  They're at the bonfire
[3317.30s -> 3327.21s]  Damn it. Oh, well, you know I'm saying I just want that person to be walking around and a red invader just falls into

[3400.28s -> 3408.10s]  They see it though
[3408.10s -> 3411.06s]  I'm gonna be careful. I'm gonna end up in like an Elden Ring
[3411.62s -> 3413.62s]  funny moments compilation I
[3413.82s -> 3427.26s]  Was to go somewhere else how about like here let's look at some hotspots people fight here a lot
[3427.26s -> 3431.84s]  All right. What about over here? This is where the try-hards are, right? Okay

[3455.38s -> 3470.06s]  I'm gonna have to turn crouch on because I'm not pressing X every time. All right, let's do it. So I'm invisible
[3470.58s -> 3478.18s]  You say so when I crouch when I get in the game, I'm not I'm invisible to the people on the other team
[3478.86s -> 3492.42s]  Has been only when you move away. You have to be in a distance. Do I have to stand completely still?

[3787.34s -> 3799.18s]  All the host was the okay. I see I didn't do that that guy
[3799.84s -> 3803.72s]  Shot a bunch of mold out of his hands and I didn't have anything to do with that

[3874.80s -> 3899.86s]  There they are did I just go invisible on their screen? Oh my god, I was bowing
[3926.82s -> 3940.63s]  This guy's like do you have any other moves
[3940.87s -> 3971.85s]  Oh

[3988.64s -> 4004.00s]  I will try that now. Okay main Academy Gate. Oh, those are faith spells. They've those are cool. Let's seem fun
[4010.33s -> 4012.05s]  dragon and crucible faith moves
[4012.05s -> 4024.02s]  So, okay. I see why this is a PvP zone. It's just a circle. I want some new clothes, too
[4024.50s -> 4029.36s]  As I'm not I don't need to do the comedy thing anymore
[4029.76s -> 4044.25s]  What do I actually want to put on I guess I put on the hat I look like a dickhead though, all right
[4044.25s -> 4064.17s]  Um, I'm still medium with these big pants on this place is for duels not invasions
[4064.61s -> 4067.55s]  Who's to say that?
[4068.27s -> 4077.74s]  I'm doing it right now. Is the mimic the mimic fail actually works
[4080.95s -> 4101.22s]  Put it on it works. How is that nobody to invade here? Oh, there we go
[4101.54s -> 4107.46s]  Use the red sign on the ground I will it's cross region enabled. It is not
[4107.62s -> 4112.67s]  I'm sorry to all the people that are not in the United States
[4112.99s -> 4118.75s]  But I'm not going to get swung at dodge and then two and a half seconds later take damage for it
[4119.07s -> 4141.76s]  It's just not happening. All right. Well, well, come on. I'm a hundred and fifty three. All right, here we go
[4142.16s -> 4144.61s]  If you want to put a sign down, I'll put mine
[4146.14s -> 4156.78s]  The multiplayer password is cheese doctor. It's like that. I'm gonna put this
[4157.10s -> 4169.47s]  I guess I'm just gonna have to pull people in it's probably easier for me to pull signs in right?
[4169.95s -> 4180.83s]  Me you can't see it. All right. Well, okay. The password is cheese doctor capital C capital D cheese doctor. No spaces
[4181.31s -> 4200.16s]  No period cheese doctor er smooth face cam. All right, my goodness. Well, I just told you what it was
[4200.72s -> 4227.73s]  Here cheese doctor. See it. All right, here we go. This is trying to invade another world over and over again
[4228.45s -> 4235.36s]  The last time I did this in Dark Souls
[4235.36s -> 4240.52s]  It was insane how many signs are on the ground turn off the invasion use the remedy. Oh
[4248.81s -> 4262.74s]  Okay, how do I turn off the invasion? What happened? I finally found somebody to invade
[4263.06s -> 4302.01s]  Why would this be out here? It's Garfield. I don't think he notices. All right. Well, that was cool
[4302.25s -> 4306.28s]  No, no, I don't take it off
[4308.08s -> 4313.70s]  Like that's gonna fix it. How do I take this off? How do I take it off?
[4358.37s -> 4385.50s]  Wait, is this too obvious? I can't see I can't see the painting covers it. Oh shit. Oh shit. Oh shit
[4386.22s -> 4420.50s]  That's so funny. All right. Where are the signs? That's right. Ladies and gentlemen
[4421.14s -> 4426.96s]  I might invade your game terms and conditions do apply
[4430.53s -> 4436.66s]  Could you be the lucky viewer that germa 985 invades? This is a weird thing
[4437.22s -> 4443.22s]  Oh, well some some like some celebrity will do that and they've never played they don't they're just part of the promotion
[4443.22s -> 4448.18s]  They just don't give a shit at all. They invade like two people. That's the whole thing
[4451.57s -> 4456.75s]  That's the big wow. I can't believe it. They play for like eight minutes
[4457.31s -> 4462.75s]  All right, let's do this one. Oh, no, we're going against the joker
[4464.24s -> 4466.24s]  Two huge hammers
[4475.07s -> 4484.27s]  That's not a viewer. How do you know? I want to invade somebody in like hide. I think that's so fun

[4566.61s -> 4572.30s]  Didn't think it was gonna be twice in a row
[4574.85s -> 4599.94s]  Good game good fight. That was cool. Nobody expects twice in a row. Who are you? How about billy bobbertson?
[4600.10s -> 4610.13s]  That's that sounds fun password password is cheese doctor capital c and then dr
[4610.77s -> 4614.21s]  Capital d cheese doctor. This is still not a viewer. How do you know that?

[4837.74s -> 4895.22s]  If you get one I get one good fight. Yeah, I ran forward
[4896.02s -> 4910.94s]  Immediate pivot that was a good fight. That's the soul level 153. This is really fun
[4912.27s -> 4918.91s]  But this is really fun. I understand why people do this now. All right, I need the ones with the circles
[4919.31s -> 4929.60s]  Here we go right here. Zoram. We're uh, we'll go zoram first
[4930.08s -> 4934.16s]  Yeah, okay, how about peeing myself that sounds that's good i'm that might not even been a viewer
[4941.63s -> 4952.45s]  I don't think that was a viewer. What are the emotes I have?
[4955.17s -> 4957.17s]  Let's do this while they're before they hear her
[4964.59s -> 4977.12s]  All right. What do you got? What are you wearing? I don't see any weapons mistake right now. He's like, oh shit

[5010.80s -> 5012.69s]  What
[5012.69s -> 5014.69s]  Is happening with this person?
[5017.55s -> 5019.55s]  I'm so confused
[5024.51s -> 5027.07s]  Wait, what's going on? What the fuck is going on?
[5031.58s -> 5033.58s]  I'm so what happened
[5033.58s -> 5041.14s]  Oh, he's peeing. Okay
[5042.62s -> 5045.02s]  He also drank flask too, which uh
[5045.82s -> 5049.02s]  We all know that's uh, not allowed
[5056.21s -> 5059.65s]  And he liked he was like teleporting. That was weird. All right. Yeah, I do a password
[5059.65s -> 5065.46s]  All right. Password is cheese doctor. You can't see it, but i'll move passwords cheese doctor cheese doctor
[5070.45s -> 5075.68s]  Touch chugged flask before a fight. Is that cheating? What should I do for a flask?
[5097.81s -> 5099.79s]  for you
[5099.79s -> 5101.79s]  Uh shyness boy
[5101.87s -> 5124.91s]  Sure, i'm not gonna use that right now
[5124.99s -> 5129.10s]  Wait, actually tell me the truth is using the wondrous physique flask
[5130.54s -> 5136.99s]  Em in pvp or no, is that fine? No, okay
[5137.39s -> 5161.01s]  I don't know where this person is but they're not here. I think this is fucked up. What about over here?
[5161.33s -> 5165.63s]  All right. This is
[5166.27s -> 5181.55s]  Is there xbox that's an xbox username
[5182.19s -> 5186.33s]  What does this say? No skill ahead all the more dung ahead
[5188.70s -> 5192.24s]  Try summoning. Oh for the uh ranala
[5195.71s -> 5196.75s]  How are we?
[5196.75s -> 5213.42s]  Here we go. What the fuck what happened?
[5214.46s -> 5216.30s]  That actually worked
[5216.30s -> 5229.29s]  All right. That was i'm not using that again
[5232.41s -> 5238.99s]  Is that was that kind of unfair?
[5238.99s -> 5242.43s]  I'm sorry girthquake. That was not fair. That was just stupid
[5245.69s -> 5247.69s]  That that's that's so dumb
[5251.79s -> 5253.15s]  uh, how about
[5253.29s -> 5254.59s]  Hilarious
[5254.59s -> 5266.48s]  I want to even get one of these off from the beginning like right when it's like let's go. Let's go. Let's go, right?
[5269.52s -> 5273.02s]  That works shockingly. Well
[5273.02s -> 5274.46s]  Is that fire damage?
[5274.46s -> 5279.82s]  So technically you could put on a ton of fire resist drink that blow up and then fight them
[5280.84s -> 5287.79s]  Totally really that's weird. Oh, whoa. Whoa. Whoa. All right. Okay, we're just going you just got here
[5289.10s -> 5290.06s]  Hey
[5290.06s -> 5292.06s]  Scared the shit out of me. I thought that was

[5312.43s -> 5321.80s]  Oh
[5321.80s -> 5323.52s]  Wowie
[5323.52s -> 5325.76s]  Oh, I wanted to jump but I didn't have enough stamina
[5327.36s -> 5332.99s]  Nice fight
[5332.99s -> 5334.99s]  You're allowed to use a blue flask. You are
[5337.08s -> 5360.94s]  Well, I can drink blue. Okay, cool. So blue is allowed. Okay, it's fun. Pick me pick me, please
[5364.51s -> 5365.88s]  warrior
[5365.88s -> 5375.16s]  Millennia
[5375.16s -> 5379.48s]  I'm sorry, but there's no respect here at all. This is absolute
[5379.56s -> 5383.00s]  I'm just gonna go go straight up disrespect if this is you playing right now. Just be aware
[5383.72s -> 5391.72s]  I'm going full on disrespect mode full disrespect. You don't come in and come in here with a millennia cost plan
[5399.80s -> 5418.22s]  What the hell
[5418.22s -> 5420.22s]  Do you want to play that? All right, we'll play that
[5429.96s -> 5431.96s]  No, not that stupid thing
[5437.31s -> 5439.15s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me
[5439.15s -> 5441.71s]  She has this move where she goes in the air
[5442.35s -> 5445.07s]  And she slash slash slash you cannot fucking avoid the
[5445.63s -> 5455.29s]  Yeah, well, maybe if I didn't drink the take
[5455.77s -> 5460.73s]  Uh two-thirds of my health off in the very beginning by drinking the exploding flask and I didn't I didn't time it right
[5471.12s -> 5476.22s]  Hold on. Are we certain that the summoning signs are that accurate the circle on the ground?
[5476.78s -> 5480.73s]  How actually accurate is that?
[5480.73s -> 5490.38s]  Don't growl at me. Okay
[5490.38s -> 5492.38s]  So you can drink these that's cool. All right
[5492.46s -> 5495.98s]  I'm maybe i'm gonna change up my spells too. These are pve spells
[5496.62s -> 5499.44s]  I think i'm gonna change that up. I'm gonna put on
[5499.84s -> 5503.12s]  Just weird shit that people that people are gonna be like annoyed to have to deal with
[5504.63s -> 5509.61s]  Pve. Okay. Yeah, like shooting glintstone ice crag. You're gonna no it's not gonna work in pvp
[5510.41s -> 5541.56s]  Let's do it
[5541.56s -> 5544.36s]  Whoa, you can okay you that you poised through that
[5560.60s -> 5562.49s]  Oh fuck
[5562.49s -> 5566.19s]  Okay
[5566.19s -> 5568.19s]  I you can't he poises through it
[5568.67s -> 5570.68s]  You poise through it you poise through okay
[5570.68s -> 5576.60s]  I I for some reason I thought that the magic glintstone ice crag was gonna break that poise
[5576.60s -> 5578.76s]  But you just said you cannot become out of that animation
[5583.00s -> 5586.60s]  I didn't know I didn't know I didn't know and if I knew you would have lost by the way
[5586.68s -> 5600.22s]  That's if I knew you would have lost that fight. Okay, this is not gonna work, but maybe this will
[5601.80s -> 5604.88s]  Yeah, let's do that
[5604.88s -> 5612.16s]  That's all right, what about that was weird like freezing mist like who the fuck uses this
[5615.48s -> 5617.48s]  meteorite something weird
[5618.64s -> 5619.68s]  and
[5619.68s -> 5621.04s]  What else should I do?
[5621.04s -> 5632.75s]  crystal release
[5632.75s -> 5636.67s]  Demo or ice storm. All right, let's just be kind of like an annoying weirdo
[5646.28s -> 5648.04s]  All right, zoram. Let's go
[5648.04s -> 5655.04s]  Crystal burst is good. Oh wait, I don't want to do that
[5655.12s -> 5658.08s]  That's kind of like bad because it'll start attacking him and I don't want to start attacking him before he
[5658.97s -> 5660.33s]  That's like kind of unfair
[5660.33s -> 5669.34s]  All right, here we go. You're missing half of the pvp spells. I don't whatever
[5669.74s -> 5686.36s]  These aren't just gonna shoot over there, right?
[5686.36s -> 5689.82s]  Get out of the emote
[5690.84s -> 5692.28s]  All right, you can
[5692.28s -> 5695.96s]  You can drink you can drink that wasn't fair. That wasn't fair. You can drink that wasn't fair
[5696.76s -> 5700.22s]  Uh, that wasn't fair. You can drink
[5700.22s -> 5709.98s]  Here we go, right?
[5709.98s -> 5711.98s]  Freezing mist is weird. Nobody expects it
[5720.32s -> 5741.42s]  Holy shit
[5741.42s -> 5743.98s]  I'm alive. I'm still alive. I'm still alive. I'm still alive
[5748.28s -> 5763.69s]  Kill him kill him
[5763.69s -> 5767.69s]  That was a 99 99 int play right there
[5769.53s -> 5776.00s]  Do I just go put 99 points in int and okay no zero points
[5776.80s -> 5779.52s]  Zero points in anything else besides mind and int
[5780.16s -> 5783.04s]  And just hold down that spell
[5783.82s -> 5787.74s]  That's so dumb. All right. Maybe I want to play normally a little bit longer
[5788.38s -> 5797.50s]  Okay trans rights
[5797.50s -> 5805.15s]  Let's go for it. Get the crystal tier that makes spells cost nothing
[5806.68s -> 5819.84s]  Oh, I do. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. He's fine. Yeah
[5823.26s -> 5825.50s]  Zero cost. Oh, I don't have to do mine. You're right. Okay
[5826.06s -> 5836.46s]  Here we go. You ready
[5836.46s -> 5839.34s]  Oh
[5839.34s -> 5847.76s]  You're not gonna expect this right now
[5847.76s -> 5850.48s]  That's the first parry that we have seen all afternoon
[5874.68s -> 5879.48s]  Flail what you can't parry a flail. That's right. You can't parry a flail
[5880.30s -> 5893.92s]  It's good for pvp. All right. All right, let's go
[5897.02s -> 5902.78s]  Poth what's the swear?
[5905.98s -> 5915.55s]  Poth hot head. What is it head? You can't your name can't be head
[5925.85s -> 5932.78s]  Uh group password is cheese doctor capital c lower case h e e s e
[5933.66s -> 5940.65s]  Capital d lower case r and that's it. Why are you like five times bigger than everybody else? Hey, this guy's huge
[5943.80s -> 5950.16s]  Am I crazy or?
[5950.16s -> 5952.16s]  What the hell? Why did it come up before he threw it?
[5953.80s -> 5955.96s]  This is a cool character though. Can I be honest?
[5957.82s -> 5968.06s]  You only have a certain amount of those
[5968.14s -> 5978.32s]  Holy shit, what?
[5979.84s -> 5980.88s]  Good game
[5980.88s -> 5984.91s]  That's a cool character
[5984.91s -> 5989.50s]  Just throwing pots
[5989.50s -> 5991.50s]  I like that. That's fun
[5991.50s -> 5998.35s]  That was good. How how do you catch people off guard with that though?
[5998.75s -> 6003.47s]  Because if you come in if you have the jar, I think that you have that hat that jar on your head, right?
[6005.92s -> 6007.04s]  I'm gonna know
[6007.04s -> 6017.28s]  All right galaxy. Let's go
[6017.28s -> 6024.73s]  I will do the just put I need okay. Where do I get some of the pvp spells?
[6029.53s -> 6038.72s]  Use the cannon. It's the ead which qualifies as a square because it's an acronym for e to a dick
[6044.19s -> 6047.18s]  really
[6047.18s -> 6049.42s]  Eat eat. Oh my god
[6050.06s -> 6057.71s]  All right, let's go
[6057.71s -> 6065.26s]  That was weird, but I got you you're not gonna fuck with the guy and so far as ice storm. Are you?
[6084.00s -> 6110.14s]  Telling you nobody expects you to do that two times in a row. Whoa. What was that? He's got knives
[6110.94s -> 6113.02s]  Oh, that's right consumables exist
[6119.80s -> 6128.40s]  That was that was a good that was a good idea throwing daggers
[6133.40s -> 6140.49s]  Yeah, everybody does the Thanos snap. I should do it too then right? I gotta do the meadow. How come I can't throw these?
[6141.21s -> 6146.09s]  Because you could really okay, you could freak somebody out, right?
[6149.56s -> 6150.84s]  if I
[6150.84s -> 6154.22s]  Like stew a soap. Hey, what about this weird shit?
[6155.85s -> 6169.60s]  Gravitational shockwave like who's ready for that? We already saw you

[6173.26s -> 6178.25s]  Like if you think i'm doing something, but it's like wait, he just did soap
[6183.48s -> 6185.64s]  You gotta freak the gamers out with soap
[6189.56s -> 6202.22s]  Level, uh 153 earthquake was the guy that you cheesed. I didn't cheese anybody
[6206.84s -> 6208.84s]  How are you? Welcome to the fight?
[6209.88s -> 6240.40s]  Let's begin
[6240.40s -> 6242.40s]  Oh, that's not good
[6242.48s -> 6250.28s]  Good fight fight caught you right at the little tail end of that
[6255.12s -> 6258.16s]  That was very close to you. Not getting in the hitbox
[6258.72s -> 6267.85s]  It would have been lag would have been like cool
[6268.25s -> 6274.88s]  Okay, but your password and the level on the screen so people don't ask anymore. That's a good idea
[6275.28s -> 6283.76s]  Let me do that real quick. Okay
[6283.76s -> 6285.76s]  password is
[6290.35s -> 6291.87s]  Okay, and
[6291.87s -> 6294.88s]  It's all level 153. There we go
[6295.44s -> 6307.64s]  We're gonna go
[6307.64s -> 6319.20s]  All right. That's okay, right?
[6319.20s -> 6321.90s]  All right. Oh shit. We're playing. Okay. Here we go
[6322.62s -> 6354.89s]  What was that?

[6410.68s -> 6420.00s]  That's fine. Okay, that's fine. Interesting. Okay, you got those horns
[6422.60s -> 6424.60s]  I wonder if you're also gonna have the um
[6428.72s -> 6435.12s]  That move the weird one. It's not aligned with the ruins bar
[6435.20s -> 6441.04s]  I actually was thinking that somebody was going to be very very upset about that, right property of germa 9-8
[6441.04s -> 6445.66s]  But yeah, like a watermark
[6445.66s -> 6450.78s]  Imagine watermarking you stream like that like I mean huge like across the whole thing

[6511.42s -> 6512.96s]  Okay
[6512.96s -> 6518.01s]  I like that build the build school

[6540.91s -> 6564.12s]  It's pretty high. What are you doing?
[6567.08s -> 6570.12s]  You can hear us

[8538.70s -> 8541.74s]  And somebody threw a fucking full large soda from the audience
[8542.46s -> 8546.22s]  And they hit me in the back of the head and you you I didn't do that
[8546.30s -> 8548.94s]  Like somebody fucking hit me in the head with like a fucking box
[8551.37s -> 8553.37s]  One more like they hit me

[8742.28s -> 8746.25s]  Having an actually ranked system in this game. I think would be really
[8750.57s -> 8751.77s]  right
[8751.77s -> 8775.18s]  Stat stamina
[8775.50s -> 8781.92s]  Oh

[8783.92s -> 8785.92s]  Oh, what a comeback. Damn
[8786.64s -> 8792.70s]  That was really that was what a great comeback. I was trying to get too fancy with it
[8792.70s -> 8795.68s]  I should have just went in and swung. That was yeah, that was
[8796.24s -> 8807.26s]  No, I didn't throw that was a great comeback. I ran out of stamina. I tried to dodge and I didn't no that's not throw
[8808.14s -> 8811.74s]  That was a great come that was great gameplay from the other player
[8812.54s -> 8831.71s]  All right, last one no
[8831.71s -> 8834.84s]  Yeah, this this person looks interesting
[8835.87s -> 8837.87s]  all right joseph
[8838.27s -> 8857.40s]  Joseph has a slab of concrete. It's a fingerprint shield resident sleeper. What does that do?
[8863.16s -> 8874.67s]  Why is it for it? Okay
[8875.39s -> 8889.63s]  What are you doing?
[8889.63s -> 8894.03s]  Um, wait, do I do we get to wait till he does all those like warcraft buffs or what can I attack him?
[8895.34s -> 8897.34s]  I don't okay. I'm just going i'm going in
[8898.91s -> 8900.86s]  What are you doing?
[8900.86s -> 8937.24s]  Joy tag are we ready? Oh this guy's a million poise. Never mind
[8937.88s -> 9000.97s]  Shit should have dodged in front of him. Oh
[9003.32s -> 9010.72s]  God that was close
[9010.72s -> 9012.08s]  That was a boss
[9012.08s -> 9014.99s]  That was a boss for me. That was really hard
[9015.55s -> 9035.07s]  That was a redditor. How can you tell when somebody's a redditor? I don't get it. I'm thinking about it
[9036.46s -> 9040.88s]  All right
[9040.88s -> 9043.52s]  I mean we have to summon the person that's called
[9044.32s -> 9046.48s]  Barf drinker, okay, and then that's it
[9050.30s -> 9054.22s]  You have a disgusting name you obviously have any outfit that you have on
[9054.94s -> 9056.94s]  Your name is barf drinker
[9058.00s -> 9060.08s]  And then I promise i'm gonna go do invasions. I promise
[9060.72s -> 9062.68s]  This is the last one
[9062.68s -> 9066.44s]  If I do another pvp summoning sign thing in this spot
[9067.08s -> 9069.92s]  right after this fight
[9069.92s -> 9073.92s]  And within five minutes of this one, you know, I don't care about semantics
[9073.92s -> 9075.76s]  I'll delete my channel if I do not
[9075.76s -> 9080.78s]  You know what I mean? Like if I do another one in a row right now in the next five minutes
[9081.66s -> 9083.96s]  All right barf drinker, but what's up?
[9087.58s -> 9089.58s]  Oh my i'm gonna get bm'd aren't I?
[9092.99s -> 9099.16s]  It's so stupid
[9099.16s -> 9101.16s]  He's throwing rocks at me
[9113.40s -> 9127.92s]  What the fuck what the hell is happening here?
[9129.98s -> 9136.60s]  How did you avoid that?
[9136.60s -> 9138.60s]  You dick. Oh dick
[9142.44s -> 9146.46s]  He wants to poison me and end it your cockiness is gonna be the end here for you
[9148.08s -> 9152.48s]  His cockiness is gonna get you killed man. I'm telling you this cocky behavior is gonna get you killed. I'm saying it
[9155.15s -> 9157.31s]  You want to end it with a fucking oh i'm gonna shoot him with the cannon
[9158.72s -> 9166.27s]  No, you're not this person's freaking me out. I don't know what they're gonna do next
[9175.29s -> 9180.70s]  Fine
[9180.70s -> 9182.70s]  I can play that game too. You know
[9199.45s -> 9202.09s]  I thought I was gonna kill him too. That was crazy
[9208.08s -> 9210.24s]  I'm telling you you that would have that was close
[9212.73s -> 9217.26s]  All right, i'm leaving
[9217.26s -> 9218.86s]  i'm gonna go to
[9218.86s -> 9224.01s]  Like up here the halong tree or something like up here
[9226.57s -> 9228.57s]  Yeah, like right up here on the roots
[9228.57s -> 9233.05s]  What was my record anybody keep track?
[9233.63s -> 9235.63s]  What was the uh kd there?
[9235.71s -> 9258.25s]  Come on someone someone in the group has become a lord
[9261.28s -> 9263.66s]  What?
[9263.66s -> 9267.07s]  What the hell does that mean?
[9267.07s -> 9269.55s]  Does somebody using this password beat the game?
[9272.27s -> 9276.73s]  That's so funny. Can I not invade anybody on the tree?
[9278.12s -> 9281.96s]  Somebody just ended the game. That's that's so cute that it does that
[9290.25s -> 9297.12s]  Wait and you get a buff too
[9297.12s -> 9300.32s]  Really? That's pretty cool
[9300.32s -> 9303.26s]  All right. Nobody wants to fight here
[9304.00s -> 9306.80s]  Oh, they're not people right here. There's so many people. Uh,
[9307.44s -> 9309.04s]  Soul level coming in here
[9309.04s -> 9312.72s]  That's impossible
[9312.72s -> 9323.58s]  Sometimes it says lord sometimes it says elden lord. It's really weird. Sometimes it says nothing
[9324.14s -> 9327.20s]  It's weird. I don't know what the fuck I was just doing
[9328.64s -> 9332.00s]  I just walked off. I for some reason thought I was in a different zone
[9333.76s -> 9335.76s]  I was very strange. I don't know why I just did that
[9336.32s -> 9340.60s]  It depends on the ending. Oh, that's cool
[9341.98s -> 9355.21s]  All right. Well, i'm gonna that was apparently a bad place to do this. Anyways, this is this probably more people here
[9363.39s -> 9365.63s]  Your level is very high. So it might be hard to fight people
[9367.56s -> 9369.32s]  Yeah, I mean I am
[9369.32s -> 9371.88s]  like end stage final ending
[9372.36s -> 9381.26s]  I was 150 when I beat the game right 145 maybe all right, let's do it
[9385.08s -> 9389.74s]  Where are they at defeat pea break?
[9390.30s -> 9412.78s]  What's going on over there? That was really weird. Okay
[9413.50s -> 9440.51s]  I hear footsteps. Where are they?
[9441.88s -> 9447.77s]  Are they on top?
[9455.29s -> 9466.43s]  Oh my god, that was terrifying
[9470.48s -> 9473.84s]  I guess they could just turn the stream on if they're if we have the same password
[9476.24s -> 9481.69s]  It worked. That was a really loud scream. I'm sorry. That was fucking horrible
[9491.45s -> 9507.04s]  Invasions don't work with a password. Oh, all right. Oh, come on
[9520.38s -> 9522.38s]  At okay, whoever I invaded
[9522.46s -> 9524.86s]  Oh, man, you would you probably went like this
[9525.66s -> 9527.93s]  No
[9527.93s -> 9534.49s]  Just barely missed came right down sliced in the animation landed right next to me
[9535.21s -> 9538.51s]  You must you must have been lining that shot up being like, oh my god
[9538.51s -> 9540.83s]  He actually doesn't know and you just miss
[9541.55s -> 9544.11s]  Oh that would that's so sad. I'm so sorry
[9551.50s -> 9554.94s]  I almost went off with you though. I actually almost fell off with you
[9555.50s -> 9565.39s]  The lunge attack never works. I honestly don't
[9566.80s -> 9568.48s]  I feel like it got worse
[9568.48s -> 9571.61s]  I remember in dark souls 1
[9572.01s -> 9574.52s]  and dark souls 2
[9574.52s -> 9576.52s]  Ball r1 was
[9576.58s -> 9582.41s]  Insanely good. I feel i'm terrified. I don't want to use it in these newer games. I feel like it's awful
[9582.41s -> 9588.28s]  I think I could never get it to work
[9588.28s -> 9590.36s]  It still is did they made it harder to hit then probably
[9591.24s -> 9596.96s]  What am I doing?
[9596.96s -> 9598.96s]  i'm trying to invade
[9599.04s -> 9607.28s]  Fair mazula should be non-stop invasions at this level. You know, that's a good point
[9608.57s -> 9611.23s]  Okay, we'll see if this works
[9611.23s -> 9615.47s]  Jump r2 is really good. Yeah jump the jumping r2 is that's one of the probably best move of the whole game
[9619.00s -> 9622.04s]  This is probably the best single move you can do to anything in the whole game
[9626.81s -> 9640.00s]  All right, 10 more seconds and i'm gonna go to fair mazula. All right fucking just die because like i'm not gonna be low
[9640.16s -> 9641.36s]  Oh
[9641.36s -> 9652.03s]  Reminder that you promised you would eat a glove if the three stooges were I didn't whatever that's doctored footage. I didn't say that
[9652.59s -> 9659.79s]  All right fair mazula
[9659.79s -> 9662.48s]  Where should I go? Just kind of right here
[9662.96s -> 9666.12s]  right on the bridge
[9666.12s -> 9684.46s]  Right here. Yeah passwords don't matter for invasions. Yeah, that's that makes sense though, doesn't it?
[9685.34s -> 9688.35s]  otherwise, wouldn't you kind of just be able to
[9689.61s -> 9691.61s]  farm invasions with your friends
[9692.01s -> 9694.19s]  I actually don't really know how this works, but
[9694.43s -> 9717.93s]  Really? You're having trouble finding people 150 here
[9718.57s -> 9728.43s]  Please germa help me beat the last boss. I'm on it right now and it'll be my first win
[9729.23s -> 9731.60s]  Yeah, i'm gonna do uh help
[9732.08s -> 9738.67s]  I'll try to help spam the finger. I go to the one of the other bonfires
[9744.00s -> 9749.31s]  150 plus is considered over leveled
[9749.79s -> 9756.20s]  Um, I don't I is it though. I thought maybe like 180 or something one. I was like
[9756.76s -> 9759.32s]  120 when I was here like 140
[9760.20s -> 9761.48s]  Who died?
[9765.93s -> 9771.53s]  Who died
[9771.53s -> 9775.29s]  What somebody's dead? Who the fuck are these people? What's going on?
[9776.67s -> 9778.67s]  I came in and somebody died
[9781.23s -> 9783.23s]  We didn't even bow yet
[9783.23s -> 9784.67s]  What happened?
[9784.67s -> 9791.85s]  The reason why I I zoned into the game and it was like, oh that person somebody died
[9791.93s -> 9794.73s]  I was like, oh am I gonna get i'm gonna get returned to my world. I don't know what happened
[9795.45s -> 9801.48s]  It said recuse and die. Was that another invader?
[9806.12s -> 9809.88s]  That was a different invader that died and then I came wow. We will look really stupid
[9811.68s -> 9813.68s]  Back-to-back invasions and the
[9814.16s -> 9817.36s]  I come in and just kind of walk around and die and I didn't even fight anybody
[9819.18s -> 9823.02s]  That was so bad. I just kind of fell off the edge and they just bullied me
[9827.44s -> 9829.84s]  Yeah, there are no rules in it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I gotta
[9830.48s -> 9834.32s]  I gotta get that into my head
[9834.32s -> 9836.72s]  I have to act like a from software
[9837.20s -> 9840.11s]  NPC i'm gonna show you exactly what that means
[9846.30s -> 9848.30s]  Okay, please don't go in the boss room
[9850.30s -> 9879.16s]  You're both there you are
[9879.16s -> 9881.56s]  Boy, this is the actor who is this? This is the actual person
[9884.48s -> 9887.04s]  What how many people are there? What the fuck?
[9888.35s -> 9889.63s]  Hey
[9889.63s -> 9893.90s]  What if he's gonna fall off?
[9911.76s -> 9914.08s]  Host plus two co-op helpers. Oh shit
[9917.00s -> 9924.97s]  Okay, I get it. I get it. So you I just gotta go for it. I get it. I did. Okay, that was confusing
[9925.61s -> 9930.38s]  Okay. All right. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I get it
[9937.74s -> 9940.03s]  No mercy
[9940.03s -> 9944.43s]  There's no honor dude. Stop. Okay. All right. Fine. No honor. There's no honor
[9947.00s -> 9949.24s]  Someone in the group defeated the shard bearer
[9955.63s -> 9959.31s]  Use the tree sentinel to your advantage. Oh my god, just stand next to it
[9960.19s -> 9962.76s]  Stand next to it and taunt
[9962.76s -> 9974.73s]  Tree sentinel is usually dead
[9974.89s -> 10005.36s]  All right, let's go
[10011.92s -> 10014.16s]  This is bullshit
[10014.16s -> 10016.16s]  This is it's bullshit. This is bullshit
[10020.22s -> 10022.30s]  Yeah, this is this is absolute. I look like an asshole
[10026.32s -> 10030.81s]  Wait, i'm invisible. All right
[10030.81s -> 10032.25s]  Where's the other player?
[10032.25s -> 10034.38s]  Are there two players?
[10034.38s -> 10059.15s]  I don't know how either one of us didn't get hit by that
[10059.23s -> 10111.39s]  What the fuck use the explosive flask?
[10114.57s -> 10115.45s]  I
[10115.45s -> 10118.44s]  I mean, it's so
[10118.44s -> 10119.80s]  If it was me
[10119.80s -> 10123.48s]  I'm just trying to think of this if this is me doing this like playing and somebody invaded me
[10124.12s -> 10127.72s]  And I was fighting the tree sentinel like I had just gotten here maybe like 10 minutes ago
[10128.52s -> 10130.44s]  I'm fighting the tree sentinel
[10130.44s -> 10137.24s]  And somebody invades me and drinks the exploding flask and lols me at the boss. I'd probably fucking be pissed
[10138.04s -> 10141.56s]  I would probably flip out. I'd be like
[10142.36s -> 10146.52s]  I would be so mad
[10146.52s -> 10149.56s]  That was me. It was a connection error. Ah, too bad. Good fight though
[10150.20s -> 10157.15s]  Uh, I did try to bm and cheese you and that's uh, that's what I deserve to be disconnected for that
[10159.71s -> 10171.74s]  Here we go. It's like you were waiting for me. You knew I was gonna spawn in this spot
[10172.38s -> 10176.59s]  All right, it's free sentinel alive
[10176.83s -> 10179.15s]  Fuck you killed the tree sentinel you guys played
[10180.83s -> 10182.75s]  All right. Okay easy
[10182.75s -> 10190.46s]  I was I don't know what I was just doing that far. I was trying to freak him out
[10195.64s -> 10210.51s]  Like I don't know why I figured like I don't know sometimes people do like the monkey see monkey do thing
[10211.15s -> 10215.39s]  Where he I jumped up on the balcony and jumped and people I i'm kind of one of these people
[10215.39s -> 10219.07s]  I'd be like, all right fine. I'll do that too. I'll show you i'm not an idiot. I can do it and then they jump up
[10227.32s -> 10229.32s]  All right, let's actually go for it
[10236.75s -> 10242.09s]  Duel so you don't get ganked and dunked on. Oh, I mean, it's fun regardless, honestly
[10243.60s -> 10257.68s]  Okay, i'm not sure if they've been here yet
[10258.24s -> 10306.97s]  Oh my god
[10307.05s -> 10309.05s]  Why I think it's I think I think I
[10316.12s -> 10320.80s]  This is so scuffed
[10320.80s -> 10322.33s]  They just hit a wall
[10322.33s -> 10324.33s]  Your sword hit a wall
[10329.79s -> 10331.95s]  I'm, so sorry if that was you that was kind of horrible
[10348.49s -> 10351.13s]  All right. I'm gonna go somewhere else somewhere. That's not just a bridge
[10351.93s -> 10362.52s]  On the rooftops here. Yeah, like over here somewhere somewhere weird
[10363.24s -> 10364.96s]  I like this
[10364.96s -> 10371.50s]  Is they gonna be jumping around here, especially in this area right there? They're gonna be jumping to that area
[10371.90s -> 10390.44s]  Here I can fight. It's a good spot. I want to fight somebody right here
[10391.08s -> 10405.60s]  Who's willing to do it? Let's get some signs right here. You're willing to do it. You want to fight me on this ledge
[10406.08s -> 10420.33s]  When I come back, I think they're up top
[10421.61s -> 10480.19s]  Okay, get up there
[10480.19s -> 10508.80s]  This poor guy
[10512.12s -> 10514.59s]  The birds were dead up here
[10514.59s -> 10519.71s]  Were you trying to run off the edge? I think he was trying to jump off. I think he was trying to to get killed
[10520.11s -> 10524.46s]  If he'd stayed up there, he would probably had a better shot
[10528.22s -> 10529.82s]  Why scarlet rot?
[10529.82s -> 10538.25s]  Uh, we got any signs here?
[10538.25s -> 10540.56s]  Okay, who wants to where's oh my god
[10543.05s -> 10553.48s]  baby dragon sure
[10553.48s -> 10555.16s]  try
[10555.16s -> 10563.71s]  Okay, how you doing?
[10564.03s -> 10566.03s]  So this is a 1v1 up here
[10566.83s -> 10568.52s]  Gotta be careful
[10568.52s -> 10571.58s]  One wrong dodge gets killed ready?
[10572.14s -> 10593.74s]  Let's go. What the fuck?
[10611.12s -> 10612.72s]  What the hell
[10612.72s -> 10619.77s]  That was insane
[10619.77s -> 10622.33s]  No disrespect, but when you laugh, why doesn't your face move?
[10636.41s -> 10639.23s]  What happened there though? That was fucking crazy
[10639.79s -> 10651.93s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I want to do that again. What happened there?
[10653.92s -> 10655.92s]  It moves a lot that you
[10655.92s -> 10661.82s]  Oh, so she jumped off turned and did the move. That was crazy
[10663.24s -> 10666.12s]  I see. So that was the last that was the latch last ditch play
[10667.08s -> 10670.36s]  That was a oh fuck. I'm gonna fall. I gotta kill him now
[10671.00s -> 10678.94s]  Why doesn't your face move?
[10681.29s -> 10683.29s]  All right. Uh, who else we got?
[10683.69s -> 10686.97s]  All right. Yeah. Yeah, we're gonna we gotta we gotta bring in the barf drinker
[10688.89s -> 10691.13s]  I don't know what the barf drinker is gonna do up here, but good luck
[10695.72s -> 10702.38s]  Does your face not move? All right barf, let's go
[10733.20s -> 10739.88s]  He's going for the cannon
[10739.88s -> 10741.88s]  Oh barf drinker. Good try
[10751.56s -> 10761.13s]  All right
[10761.13s -> 10762.25s]  who uh
[10762.25s -> 10764.65s]  Who wants to go for it?
[10764.65s -> 10765.77s]  Okay
[10765.77s -> 10768.99s]  Who wants to go for it? Who wants to go for uh?
[10770.27s -> 10773.34s]  This is gonna be a disaster
[10776.09s -> 10778.65s]  You can wear a helmet a helmet of your choice
[10779.29s -> 10791.55s]  I don't know if I like that. I kind of like that. I kind of like this
[10796.99s -> 10798.99s]  All right, we gotta go. This is a grinch
[10801.69s -> 10808.86s]  Is there a block or a parry or anything?
[10809.10s -> 10850.89s]  Here we go. All right grinch, you know the rules. This is gonna take fucking forever
[10858.04s -> 10859.32s]  Uh-oh
[10859.32s -> 10876.88s]  I just baited it up
[10876.88s -> 10891.87s]  Damn it
[10891.87s -> 10893.31s]  oops
[10893.31s -> 10894.91s]  I was gonna go
[10894.91s -> 10917.08s]  That was fun. Let's not do that ever again. All right. I have a new game
[10918.04s -> 10921.21s]  the new game is
[10921.21s -> 10923.21s]  and you knock me off this platform
[10923.61s -> 10931.88s]  In one minute i'm gonna look like a total dickhead. You have to get you have to knock me off the platform in one minute
[10931.96s -> 10934.12s]  I don't how however you do it. Whatever means necessary
[10934.68s -> 10937.68s]  All right, how much strength do I need to put on some of these great shields?
[10938.40s -> 10941.93s]  Okay, I can put this one on this is 90. I know I need 100
[10944.44s -> 10946.88s]  28 30
[10946.88s -> 10948.65s]  20, okay
[10948.65s -> 10952.09s]  Uh, i'm going to go respec to 99 endurance
[10953.45s -> 10958.76s]  And like 30 strength
[10958.76s -> 10979.05s]  We're back. You have one minute to get rid of me. Uh, yeah my current stats here. Somebody remember this
[10979.53s -> 10989.56s]  Because I won't here we go
[10989.64s -> 11005.07s]  This is so annoying
[11005.39s -> 11007.63s]  All right 95 I need not mine
[11008.51s -> 11017.85s]  I need enough to hold two great shields in my hand 20 27 do it
[11018.41s -> 11026.84s]  30 strength should do it right
[11026.84s -> 11028.60s]  Soft cap is 80
[11028.60s -> 11030.60s]  strength per shield 35
[11030.84s -> 11041.60s]  60 is soft cap
[11041.60s -> 11043.36s]  60 60 60
[11043.36s -> 11048.38s]  And we use any weapon you can use anything you want you can use literally anything in the game
[11048.78s -> 11062.89s]  No, I want I this I think this is fine 80 is hard cap. Yeah, okay. I think this is fine
[11063.53s -> 11081.23s]  Am I going to be naked? No, absolutely not. Uh
[11082.03s -> 11084.03s]  I need the heaviest shield in the whole game
[11085.07s -> 11086.59s]  Probably one. It's probably this
[11086.59s -> 11112.22s]  Uh, what's the heaviest armor in the whole game? Probably this right the lionel stuff or is it the pumpkin head?
[11115.66s -> 11137.76s]  Old goat old goat everything. Yeah now I need
[11138.72s -> 11139.84s]  uh
[11139.84s -> 11141.84s]  Greatly increases maximum hp
[11142.64s -> 11148.38s]  I need
[11148.38s -> 11153.04s]  Uh the equipment. I don't care about equipment alone. I need
[11153.52s -> 11166.94s]  Extra enormously boost physical damage negation. What else vastly magic defense?
[11171.87s -> 11176.22s]  and under stamina
[11176.70s -> 11207.82s]  Good luck shield talisman. I have it on raises defense when hp is at maximum go upgrade the shields
[11209.16s -> 11211.13s]  I don't have it
[11211.13s -> 11218.08s]  Should I go upgrade these bolts plus 10? I feel like that's such a waste
[11221.98s -> 11227.61s]  At least like plus eight or plus nine. Yeah, I don't have the runes to do that
[11227.93s -> 11230.09s]  I have remembrances that i'm not going to use I got a lot
[11231.55s -> 11233.55s]  All right, i'm gonna both these shields are gonna get plus nine
[11245.95s -> 11248.19s]  Oh nice congrats
[11252.30s -> 11253.90s]  30 000 should do it
[11253.90s -> 11261.90s]  You can only block with one of them. I think the one on the right is more effective, right?
[11262.54s -> 11264.57s]  Let's see if I can do it
[11264.57s -> 11270.56s]  Which one is better the one on my right hand is more damage negation, right?
[11271.28s -> 11277.40s]  Upgrading shield does literally nothing for their defense. Does it do anything?
[11280.38s -> 11282.38s]  Just increases the damage. Oh, okay
[11287.69s -> 11289.93s]  Fingerprint shield has 100 physical damage
[11292.46s -> 11296.38s]  Makes them use less stamina when blocking it increases. Okay, i'm just gonna do it who cares
[11298.51s -> 11301.15s]  If we break your guard then can we yeah, you just however you can get rid of me
[11306.11s -> 11308.11s]  This one's good though, right?
[11308.19s -> 11311.07s]  This thing I think this is the one what I don't want to go get the other shield
[11312.91s -> 11314.91s]  And how how how easy is it?
[11318.99s -> 11328.06s]  Is it like simple to go get it?
[11328.06s -> 11331.82s]  Not very. All right. Well, i'm just gonna do which one is better for defense. This one's probably this one here
[11332.14s -> 11339.18s]  All right, i'm going for it
[11339.74s -> 11349.92s]  Hold on how many do I need?
[11350.56s -> 11353.68s]  I have access to every single stone in the game besides the plus 10 one
[11358.12s -> 11359.72s]  All right smithing stone
[11359.72s -> 11362.30s]  How many do I need?
[11362.30s -> 11364.30s]  a 15 30 29
[11364.78s -> 11366.78s]  25 i've said shitload of these
[11371.21s -> 11375.29s]  12 per step. All right. Well, we I don't have any plus one smithing stones
[11378.73s -> 11384.17s]  I need you don't even have the basic ones. You don't have access to smithing stones one. What the fuck
[11389.55s -> 11391.71s]  You missed out on a lot of early dungeons
[11395.32s -> 11397.48s]  Whatever. I'm just going i'm going to summon people
[11404.03s -> 11406.03s]  Zero exploration andy that's not true
[11406.75s -> 11426.25s]  So I got one in my back and one on my front. I'm good. Let's do it. Good luck everybody. You have uh, you have one minute
[11427.13s -> 11433.07s]  Get rid of me. I'll knock you off. Okay
[11433.95s -> 11450.44s]  I'm gonna get right in the middle
[11450.60s -> 11452.84s]  By the way, I can I can push you if I want to
[11456.24s -> 11479.28s]  It's just bob-omb's battlefield, man
[11488.52s -> 11490.52s]  Oh shit, not gonna happen
[11506.62s -> 11510.54s]  It was the first person. Yeah, but I shouldn't have been attacked. All right. I get it. I get it. I get it
[11510.54s -> 11512.30s]  I shouldn't be attacking
[11512.30s -> 11538.64s]  Congratulations, you knocked the guy off. I should I know attacking I can knock you off too, by the way stay still
[11556.11s -> 11557.47s]  Sorry
[11557.47s -> 11567.05s]  This is so annoying
[11567.05s -> 11569.05s]  All right, you got through the defense
[11592.30s -> 11609.60s]  Oh, you got it. All right, whatever then we said this sucks. All right, this one's for
[11610.96s -> 11614.33s]  This is this is dumb who cares
[11616.78s -> 11619.74s]  Oh, you gotta come in and notice. I feel like i'm in like the eighth grade
[11620.22s -> 11625.26s]  This is like the oh man, let's put on a bunch of gear and you try to knock me off
[11625.90s -> 11632.17s]  I'm in the i'm in the seventh grade. No
[11634.92s -> 11648.89s]  Hmm. All right fine. You get me
[11649.98s -> 11655.18s]  In the first move that must have walked out
[11658.43s -> 11671.12s]  Okay, this sucks
[11671.12s -> 11674.00s]  All right, this sucks. This is stupid. This sucks
[11676.68s -> 11685.31s]  That's all right. Whatever that was like whatever but wait, I have enough strength to put on
[11686.19s -> 11688.19s]  All right. Now i'm gonna play with like a big two-hander or something
[11688.83s -> 11692.41s]  I don't have any weapon upgrades. Fuck. I gotta go back. Okay, here's what i'm doing
[11693.05s -> 11708.97s]  That was awful two handing a shield. Yeah
[11712.51s -> 11714.75s]  i'm gonna do my other uh
[11714.83s -> 11745.69s]  shithead build
[11745.69s -> 11756.89s]  99 int you have so many mana flasks pvp. Yeah, but I wanted to be able to hold the same move down
[11763.93s -> 11765.93s]  Actually make you cast faster
[11766.65s -> 11793.64s]  That's true. I can't move
[11794.83s -> 11796.83s]  All right, okay
[11796.83s -> 11808.32s]  uh, how about
[11808.32s -> 11810.94s]  Okay, raise intelligence. Yeah
[11811.90s -> 11815.29s]  I like this one. They can stay on
[11815.37s -> 11822.41s]  uh this one
[11822.41s -> 11824.09s]  and um
[11824.09s -> 11830.57s]  fp
[11830.57s -> 11839.07s]  Okay, use the sore seal. Oh, that's right
[11842.76s -> 11844.28s]  This doesn't do
[11844.28s -> 11846.08s]  um
[11846.08s -> 11847.52s]  Yeah, the stats I want
[11847.52s -> 11854.94s]  Whatever. Okay. My equipment load is so bad
[11855.66s -> 11872.06s]  I'm still at medium. How that seems impossible. What?
[11872.86s -> 11879.32s]  Oh, I didn't have a weapon equipped
[11879.40s -> 11883.84s]  All right, just give me the staff
[11883.84s -> 11886.00s]  Now it's heavy load. Shit. Okay. Well, that makes sense
[11893.05s -> 11896.81s]  Okay. Now I want to do moves that I want to do the fp flask
[11897.77s -> 11904.12s]  They could sneeze and kill you I know but i'm gonna be able just to spam moves
[11904.84s -> 11909.20s]  If I touch somebody with a move they did
[11909.20s -> 11916.62s]  Where do I want to do this?
[11916.62s -> 11921.29s]  How about like right? How about where um?
[11921.77s -> 11928.78s]  Yeah, like down here. No, no one's gonna be there. Maybe like one of these uh, like the church or the hallowee tree
[11929.34s -> 11931.64s]  Or the foot of the forge
[11931.64s -> 11938.20s]  The image is not going to be that crazy. Well, whatever
[11938.92s -> 11943.31s]  Now if our result was fine, let's go here
[11944.19s -> 11948.73s]  Worst build that takes five minutes to set up
[11949.29s -> 11955.44s]  All right. I need to put on the fp stuff. All right, that's just an experiment. Let's see what happened
[11967.53s -> 11969.45s]  I want the
[11969.45s -> 11971.85s]  All fp consumption and the magic boost
[11972.73s -> 11981.56s]  Where is it?
[11981.56s -> 11983.32s]  Is there a magic boost one?
[11983.32s -> 11988.03s]  I don't think so
[11988.03s -> 11989.15s]  stamina
[11989.15s -> 11999.29s]  Oh, there it is. Okay. Okay. Here we go. This is so bad, but whatever
[11999.93s -> 12006.36s]  I'm just gonna be annoying. I'm thinking the moon
[12007.56s -> 12011.15s]  I have a ton of decks too. All right
[12011.15s -> 12013.36s]  What would be annoying here?
[12013.36s -> 12015.13s]  probably
[12015.13s -> 12018.22s]  this
[12018.22s -> 12019.90s]  probably
[12019.90s -> 12025.45s]  Maybe like collapsing stars. That would be kind of annoying
[12026.09s -> 12032.27s]  I'll try this
[12032.27s -> 12034.11s]  magic downpour
[12034.11s -> 12036.11s]  That's a good idea. Actually i'll do that
[12043.37s -> 12045.37s]  Yeah, the moon's gonna take too long
[12046.14s -> 12048.14s]  founding rain of stars
[12048.14s -> 12049.42s]  or
[12049.42s -> 12053.92s]  I think i'm gonna try founding rain of stars. I feel like that's really irritating
[12055.16s -> 12057.16s]  Magic downpour i'll try it fine
[12058.12s -> 12075.15s]  Here we go
[12075.15s -> 12077.39s]  Do all mana flasks you didn't die in one hit. Oh, you're right
[12078.43s -> 12079.55s]  It's all right
[12079.55s -> 12087.56s]  I'm gonna confuse the person that I invade though because they're gonna hit me one time and i'm gonna die
[12102.51s -> 12108.62s]  All the way over there
[12108.62s -> 12110.62s]  Oh, you're so far away
[12110.86s -> 12118.14s]  How am I gonna get over there?
[12118.14s -> 12128.57s]  Use the finger again. How do I do it? How do I use the finger again?
[12129.61s -> 12143.90s]  Oh repeat
[12143.90s -> 12173.61s]  Ready? Here we go. Come on. I want to do my stupid shit. That actually might be really good. What about crystal release?
[12175.69s -> 12177.69s]  Oh, that's annoying too. Okay
[12178.09s -> 12191.55s]  This one is what does this one do? That's actually probably really annoying too
[12195.58s -> 12199.82s]  magic downpour
[12199.82s -> 12202.86s]  Magic downpour I think is the best one to do with this much intelligence
[12208.49s -> 12217.12s]  Quickly, hurry, hurry quickly. Oh my fucking god. I'm not even close to that
[12217.68s -> 12238.28s]  I'm going far away
[12238.28s -> 12240.28s]  This is a bad place to be too. This is gonna be great
[12240.76s -> 12250.81s]  Are you eating a glove if you're having this many invasions problems? No, i'm just in a bad i'm doing it in a bad spot
[12250.89s -> 12253.77s]  Here we go. This is better. All right. Here we go. Three two one action
[12257.29s -> 12259.29s]  What the fuck thought that was them
[12259.45s -> 12282.92s]  Where are they?
[12282.92s -> 12286.20s]  What no, fuck. I thought they were right around the corner. No
[12287.00s -> 12296.25s]  I thought they were gonna I heard the fighting right there. All right, i'm just fucking running at them. No more hiding
[12296.81s -> 12298.81s]  No more and my voice is doing the thing
[12303.05s -> 12307.85s]  Paramazula is too content. There's like too many bosses. Everyone that's here is doing one of the two bosses here
[12308.57s -> 12323.47s]  Where did it put me?
[12323.47s -> 12346.94s]  Where the fuck are they?
[12346.94s -> 12348.46s]  Are they above me?
[12348.46s -> 12355.79s]  How do I get up there? I don't I don't remember the layout of this place. I did it one time. How do I get up?
[12356.35s -> 12367.16s]  This does stairs go to these stairs don't go anywhere. I actually don't know how to get the fuck up there
[12373.66s -> 12376.38s]  God damn it this fucking inventory. I just put
[12377.02s -> 12390.32s]  I gotta get a fair mazilla fair mazilla is like chunk chunk chunk chunk chunk chunk chunk chunk chunk and there's two bosses
[12390.40s -> 12407.32s]  Everybody's doing it. No fuck this place. No, there's like three bosses like here here in here
[12407.40s -> 12409.40s]  And everyone's just gonna walk in the boss door
[12409.72s -> 12414.81s]  I gotta go somewhere else
[12414.81s -> 12427.98s]  My game just crashed. What happened? I'm going over here. I'm going i'm going to fucking lindell
[12428.78s -> 12435.90s]  frozen lake, ah
[12435.90s -> 12451.04s]  Let me try this. Let's see if it works. Come on. Where is it?
[12451.60s -> 12457.53s]  Where is it the inventory?
[12466.49s -> 12470.25s]  There you are i'm fucking ready let's go enough of this bullshit there you are
[12471.13s -> 12475.68s]  I just saw you you right here
[12475.92s -> 12502.70s]  Oh shit
[12502.70s -> 12505.26s]  Oh my god, why did I not what they didn't hit him?
[12505.98s -> 12510.27s]  How did that not hit him? It is him directly in the face
[12525.21s -> 12526.09s]  What?
[12526.09s -> 12527.29s]  the fuck
[12527.29s -> 12543.23s]  These moves suck. I have to okay
[12543.23s -> 12555.98s]  Somebody said dude all you did is effectively turn yourself into one of those shitty magic enemies. I died. I really am
[12557.10s -> 12558.46s]  an enemy
[12558.46s -> 12562.49s]  Oh
[12562.49s -> 12566.33s]  I really just turned myself into one of the the mages from ray lucaria that die in two swings
[12566.89s -> 12573.28s]  Not even one swing
[12573.28s -> 12582.30s]  All right, npc build
[12584.96s -> 12586.96s]  Collapsing stars i'm just gonna spam it

[12832.25s -> 12834.56s]  and they
[12834.56s -> 12836.56s]  Did a bunch of exploding spells
[12837.15s -> 12845.37s]  What do I do?
[12845.37s -> 12847.37s]  That was insane though. What the fuck?

[12876.83s -> 12878.91s]  I mean who knows I might be I should actually kill somebody
[12894.00s -> 12905.28s]  Well at 153 soul level I was more concerned about my like computer crashing
[12914.99s -> 12918.03s]  Why do I have like five vigor? It's because this is
[12918.99s -> 12922.59s]  I was doing an invasion build where I would go in and try to kill people in like one hit
[12922.99s -> 12924.99s]  I got embarrassed three times in a row
[12927.02s -> 12930.24s]  and then I uh
[12930.24s -> 12932.24s]  And then and then I had to come back here
[12941.60s -> 12945.84s]  They seem friendly. You should still back up the save. I I mean as long as they're not, you know
[12946.76s -> 12958.81s]  Try to get mad. I don't know this cross region stop west to east coast
[12964.83s -> 12968.16s]  Uh, i'm sorry. It didn't work
[12968.16s -> 12970.16s]  There's a classic barf drinker
[12970.64s -> 12972.64s]  All right captain luke harrier
[12989.23s -> 13009.56s]  You're gonna die twice and spend 10 minutes trying to fix the npc build. Oh, I just realized you have to hit me once

[13028.12s -> 13031.80s]  What the fuck? All right. I'm done. I'm done with this build. I'm done. This build is just
[13032.76s -> 13038.68s]  I just why am I using magic downpour by the way magic downpour is literally a serial block skill
[13038.92s -> 13041.80s]  You get it you use it once and then you fucking delete it from your bar. You never put it back on
[13042.12s -> 13046.16s]  This is no reason to put it on
[13046.16s -> 13049.84s]  There's no reason to put this back on. All right, i'm just let's go the let me go. Let's
[13051.58s -> 13052.54s]  So bad
[13052.54s -> 13059.47s]  I just wait
[13059.47s -> 13061.23s]  I'll be right back. Nobody move
[13061.23s -> 13070.83s]  All right, let me see. Let me what do I got my
[13070.83s -> 13080.11s]  Okay, it was 50
[13080.91s -> 13083.48s]  I believe it's 50
[13083.48s -> 13084.44s]  30
[13084.44s -> 13086.44s]  Or like no 30 maybe like 35
[13087.00s -> 13093.45s]  Let's do it. I gotta be one. We'll do 35. It sounds better
[13093.93s -> 13097.21s]  Okay
[13097.21s -> 13103.08s]  25 decks should I even have decks at this point? I probably yeah
[13107.77s -> 13110.52s]  65 intelligence
[13110.52s -> 13125.10s]  Wait, that's including items that I had on isn't it? I think that's kind of I think that's pretty good
[13126.86s -> 13133.15s]  Does not include this does not include items. I think that's because of the baby rattle was what was my decks?
[13134.67s -> 13136.67s]  Uh, it was 25 65
[13137.21s -> 13142.52s]  56
[13142.84s -> 13145.48s]  Oh my god, I have no points in endurance. That's why
[13146.20s -> 13168.06s]  All right. Um mine is a dump stat. You can just chug for more. Yeah, I gotta pee again
[13168.70s -> 13174.35s]  pretty
[13174.35s -> 13178.60s]  565 I think this is fine. I'm actually I want like 30
[13179.32s -> 13183.23s]  30 mind
[13183.23s -> 13185.05s]  30 30
[13185.05s -> 13202.56s]  That's fine. Yeah, that's that's pretty much where it was before
[13203.52s -> 13220.72s]  I could wear something better than this though
[13220.72s -> 13222.72s]  Back to reality here
[13222.72s -> 13230.24s]  It's not the right one. Okay, here we go
[13230.88s -> 13233.76s]  It's time for a couple more pvp duels after I pee
[13234.48s -> 13237.36s]  I'll do one before I pee same place
[13242.12s -> 13249.16s]  Have I been playing for four hours?
[13249.16s -> 13254.99s]  That's kind of blown by
[13255.07s -> 13257.60s]  I must be having fun
[13257.60s -> 13264.76s]  I don't know. I just summoned somebody I think
[13266.84s -> 13270.33s]  Tired
[13270.33s -> 13279.16s]  I don't know tired low
[13279.24s -> 13283.40s]  Oh, I have such these spells suck. It's okay. I really only need these two
[13284.20s -> 13293.36s]  Tired hollow. Okay, it's because of ho
[13294.08s -> 13322.94s]  Oh, that was rough
[13330.83s -> 13332.83s]  Oh good game. Damn it
[13333.71s -> 13336.03s]  Good game. I thought you were gonna come in a little bit further
[13336.59s -> 13350.04s]  Were you gonna help people fight bosses? Yeah, i'll do this for a little bit longer. That's that was a tuba reaction to
[13350.91s -> 13363.13s]  Becoming aware of that europina
[13363.45s -> 13366.12s]  who else
[13366.12s -> 13368.24s]  Luna
[13368.24s -> 13382.35s]  Pick me strong spells, but you should help people with milania
[13384.49s -> 13389.48s]  I will stand and I will help people outside of different bosses. I will that sounds fun
[13389.80s -> 13398.91s]  I guess I could take this right wondrous physique blaster. Okay
[13407.61s -> 13408.89s]  We good
[13408.89s -> 13428.00s]  You good. Are you good? Hey
[13428.64s -> 13463.23s]  Okay, here we go
[13463.23s -> 13470.44s]  Good fight. Yeah, i'll do cross region in a minute
[13473.83s -> 13484.20s]  Stealth archer. I don't know but I don't know about this one. This one's kind of freaking me out
[13484.60s -> 13488.73s]  Does that mean that the character is going to be invisible and they're going to shoot me with bow and arrow?
[13493.48s -> 13495.00s]  That's kind of sus
[13495.00s -> 13539.84s]  Dude, you got this is the best class in the game. Hey, what's up? All right. What do you got stealth archer?
[13554.68s -> 13565.10s]  I get it. I can see you you move into clothes. I you shot in the sky. I'm so confused
[13565.18s -> 13567.58s]  Okay, i've never nobody plays with bows in this game, huh?
[13568.30s -> 13632.65s]  Bow seems so cool. God damn it
[13633.29s -> 13640.65s]  Those are cool looking they're like little crystals
[13651.85s -> 13657.26s]  Fight that was actually really cool. What are those arrows?
[13660.60s -> 13674.73s]  That was really cool. They're rainbow stone arrows. That's really all I actually kind of want to play as that character
[13674.89s -> 13678.28s]  Oh
[13687.45s -> 13695.58s]  My computer crashed
[13695.58s -> 13701.84s]  Did my whole computer crash?
[13701.84s -> 13725.76s]  Come on
[13725.76s -> 13728.16s]  Can you level up a few? Do you have to be the exact same level?
[13731.64s -> 13733.24s]  I don't think you have to be the same exact level
[13733.24s -> 13747.28s]  Was it like it's like five level range 10 level range the level? Oh level doesn't matter with the password. Okay
[13747.84s -> 13761.18s]  So wait, so that means that people could I could be fighting people that are way way lower than me, right?
[13761.66s -> 13782.75s]  Technically. Yeah. Yeah, I thought I got banned. I was like, oh no, I saw the pop-up the second pop-up and i'm like
[13783.55s -> 13786.91s]  Oh, no
[13786.91s -> 13807.87s]  I have not used seeing a second pop-up window. I think that was just an actual crash
[13811.90s -> 13817.77s]  Which so what happened between dark souls 3?
[13818.47s -> 13820.47s]  Sekiro and this game
[13821.37s -> 13822.49s]  because
[13822.49s -> 13824.49s]  game crap like hardware
[13826.24s -> 13828.08s]  Those didn't happen in sekiro
[13828.08s -> 13832.72s]  They didn't happen in dark souls 3 either. I don't remember it happening
[13833.36s -> 13835.36s]  Did the game crash one time when I played?
[13835.92s -> 13838.76s]  Because open world all the shaders maybe yeah
[13839.32s -> 13841.56s]  All right. Yeah, let me go p i'll be right back
[13841.56s -> 14083.93s]  back p
[14084.41s -> 14085.93s]  I'm back
[14085.93s -> 14091.32s]  Okay, so we'll do a few more of these pvp rounds and then
[14092.44s -> 14097.87s]  Uh, we'll do some summons to do bosses. That sounds fun. It's cross region on
[14098.35s -> 14100.35s]  No, that's i'll end with that
[14100.35s -> 14104.96s]  We'll do that like in an hour or two
[14104.96s -> 14112.12s]  Hello and the audio back on
[14120.60s -> 14122.68s]  Alrighty
[14122.68s -> 14124.68s]  Cross region, you know, let's just do it now
[14124.68s -> 14135.56s]  I'll put cross region on do it from here. Oh, it's like an actual setting settings. Okay
[14137.12s -> 14139.92s]  Uh cross region perform matchmaking. Okay
[14140.80s -> 14143.87s]  Do I have to reset of the game?
[14143.87s -> 14158.22s]  I wonder if it worked. We'll do like a few more five to ten more
[14158.78s -> 14162.16s]  What do you?
[14162.16s -> 14167.63s]  okay, uh, should we go against should we go against the jeremy elbertson with the um
[14169.16s -> 14181.53s]  Let's go. Are you wearing is it wearing the same armor that I am?
[14188.11s -> 14196.11s]  Clone fight is this the real jeremy elbertson?
[14200.60s -> 14205.23s]  All right, just going for it. You get the big shield and think that shoots fire. I know that for a fact
[14211.36s -> 14220.19s]  Walk forward with it
[14220.19s -> 14229.82s]  Oh, I got through the shield
[14229.82s -> 14231.82s]  Oh, you've no idea how badly I want to backstab
[14239.64s -> 14246.36s]  He's just running
[14246.36s -> 14255.50s]  Get over here. How's it charlie brown?
[14256.06s -> 14260.49s]  Does a charlie brown yell in this game?
[14263.50s -> 14266.76s]  I've never heard that before
[14267.80s -> 14272.75s]  Oh, it's already on okay
[14272.75s -> 14274.75s]  based buffalo
[14274.75s -> 14276.70s]  Now the bow user
[14276.70s -> 14280.83s]  The bows are cool. Hold on. What else we got? Uh
[14282.22s -> 14283.42s]  based buffalo
[14283.42s -> 14287.13s]  I think so. Let's try it
[14287.21s -> 14311.47s]  I think it's the bow is fun. Nobody's using the black bow for some reason
[14312.11s -> 14315.39s]  Uh sl means soul level. I know it's probably wrong for elden ring, but
[14315.95s -> 14323.37s]  Okay, I need to put that on my bar, too. Right? Like let me just say hello
[14324.01s -> 14328.41s]  Okay, here we go
[14328.41s -> 14358.72s]  shit
[14358.72s -> 14359.60s]  Oh
[14359.60s -> 14360.88s]  close
[14360.88s -> 14363.82s]  Oh going for chip damage. That's what it is
[14366.11s -> 14393.93s]  Good fight good fight one of those arrows kills me so if I had of them would really
[14394.25s -> 14396.89s]  Is it those those not do that much damage? I wasn't really paying that much attention
[14398.19s -> 14402.81s]  I was trying to see how much they hurt for
[14402.81s -> 14406.38s]  That was an interesting build though. How do you build a character?
[14407.02s -> 14410.70s]  So you'd be able to use a great sword and a bow effectively at the same time just
[14411.34s -> 14412.38s]  quality
[14412.38s -> 14413.82s]  Does that work?
[14413.82s -> 14417.47s]  The character's ugly
[14417.47s -> 14437.61s]  Why do you just take damage? I like that one you're moving around kind of weird
[14438.25s -> 14439.29s]  I don't know
[14439.29s -> 14442.89s]  I don't like how weird you're moving around. I don't like how weird you're moving around. I don't like this
[14443.77s -> 14449.28s]  Where is this person? Okay. Um
[14452.12s -> 14454.04s]  Oh, no, don't drink
[14454.04s -> 14466.38s]  All right, but seriously though like what's even happening the guy was connecting from the moon
[14475.26s -> 14479.90s]  Cross region omega low cross. I know but whatever it don't matter
[14481.52s -> 14486.64s]  I like your name birdbrain
[14486.64s -> 14488.64s]  Oh, come on. What the fuck
[14489.28s -> 14494.88s]  Why?
[14494.88s -> 14496.64s]  Why do I keep crashing?
[14496.64s -> 14515.55s]  Uh, that's not that's not the multiplayer. That's just the game. I think your hard drive is all no my hard drive is not all like
[14516.35s -> 14527.60s]  Bunged up. All right. It's fine. It's a virus. They're sending it to you through multiplayer
[14540.80s -> 14542.80s]  Crypto miner installed
[14555.52s -> 14557.52s]  Uh-huh. I know I know I know I know
[14557.84s -> 14562.58s]  What's the password?
[14562.58s -> 14572.34s]  Cheese doctor cheese doctor. This is ramander from the toontown national bank that you still owed chad a debt to play toontown
[14579.26s -> 14596.80s]  I'm gonna say okay if this crashes again, i'm just gonna go do boss summons because what the hell what is this?
[14597.36s -> 14602.05s]  Do I dare?
[14602.05s -> 14605.71s]  summon
[14605.71s -> 14608.03s]  Do I dare summon hog rider?
[14621.54s -> 14623.90s]  that mask that
[14643.28s -> 14645.65s]  Torch interesting
[14647.84s -> 14652.38s]  Welcome to the game hog rider. You're gonna fight me with a torch. I feel like this is gonna go
[14653.02s -> 14655.02s]  Oh my god, this is fucking weird
[14656.05s -> 14658.94s]  Is this weird?
[14658.94s -> 14660.94s]  Can you upgrade the torch?
[14661.10s -> 14701.44s]  That was cool. That was really good fight. That was really cool. That weapon was actually
[14702.24s -> 14707.68s]  Can you actually play through the game with a torch?
[14712.72s -> 14715.36s]  Tvp and from software games is atrocious because of netcode
[14717.25s -> 14722.45s]  And I mean it actually really hasn't felt that bad tonight. It really hasn't it felt pretty good actually
[14723.55s -> 14725.55s]  But yeah, I mean sometimes yeah
[14727.86s -> 14731.14s]  I don't know what what is this? I don't I don't know what that says
[14734.34s -> 14736.26s]  First has like the bug stuff
[14736.26s -> 14738.45s]  sorcery
[14738.45s -> 14740.56s]  Hello
[14740.56s -> 14742.56s]  Wait hell
[14743.17s -> 14745.89s]  You can't say hell in from software games hell
[14747.42s -> 14752.58s]  Wow, there's no reason to take it seriously, but it's fun
[14753.22s -> 14759.41s]  Okay
[14759.41s -> 14763.33s]  Do you think that from software pvp would be more interesting to you?
[14764.51s -> 14766.72s]  if
[14766.72s -> 14768.72s]  You could not use
[14769.12s -> 14771.09s]  any
[14771.09s -> 14778.21s]  Like outrageous weapon arts. What if there were no weapon arts? Would you think it was if there were no weapon arts?
[14778.37s -> 14789.30s]  Would it be better or would it be boring? It would be boring. That's interesting
[14789.94s -> 14796.38s]  That's the fun part
[14796.38s -> 14801.70s]  But then what how come there's um
[14801.94s -> 14804.82s]  This game is these games are so popular. Oh, we couldn't get you. Sorry
[14805.46s -> 14807.54s]  We try to get you
[14807.54s -> 14809.22s]  unknown
[14809.22s -> 14814.35s]  none
[14814.35s -> 14821.76s]  Seems like this is gonna be a tough fight
[14821.76s -> 14824.08s]  um
[14824.08s -> 14825.81s]  How did people
[14825.81s -> 14829.97s]  Can you connect real land and play elden ring like is it possible?
[14830.61s -> 14837.31s]  Did you even do that?
[14837.31s -> 14842.42s]  No, but if you were on the same, okay
[14842.50s -> 14844.50s]  If you did no cross region
[14844.50s -> 14850.18s]  And you were playing from the same room on the same kind of like us west or whatever. Would it be fine?
[14851.22s -> 14852.66s]  the same router
[14852.66s -> 14859.87s]  Get to it. Here we go. All your clothes are off now
[14861.22s -> 14863.30s]  I don't know. I don't know what this person's doing. They're freaking me out though
[14863.94s -> 14865.94s]  They had a full costume on now. They're naked
[14883.54s -> 14884.90s]  Holy shit
[14884.90s -> 14908.64s]  Why did I almost kill you?
[14908.64s -> 14910.56s]  What was what was with the naked?
[14910.56s -> 14918.11s]  Was that to have more than
[14918.43s -> 14920.43s]  What was it? It was funny
[14920.59s -> 14926.05s]  It's a min max build
[14926.05s -> 14929.09s]  They were trying to flex on you. It was an ego boost
[14930.37s -> 14937.84s]  Well, you know, they almost did it. So it's a I it's probably more a reason
[14938.72s -> 14940.72s]  I think we already fought shpee
[14942.72s -> 14944.72s]  gravity plus fall guy
[14949.84s -> 14950.96s]  I'm interested
[14950.96s -> 14961.44s]  Does that mean you're just gonna walk off the edge?
[14961.44s -> 14963.44s]  You're gonna hate to see you fans
[14963.44s -> 14964.48s]  Hey
[14964.48s -> 14969.07s]  What are you talking about? I got it's i'm cross region right now
[14969.79s -> 15025.63s]  So what does gravity plus fall joke mean? I wonder if he was in his equipment menu
[15028.58s -> 15030.18s]  I don't think so
[15030.18s -> 15031.30s]  What do you wait?
[15031.30s -> 15036.24s]  That was
[15036.24s -> 15038.40s]  He was no way was he in an equipment menu?
[15038.96s -> 15045.79s]  Maybe he realized that he was like, oh he's this guy's using the stupid ass bullshit. This guy's doing red as mastery
[15046.51s -> 15048.75s]  What a chump. All right. Well, i'm gonna put a different weapon on
[15056.03s -> 15058.03s]  You beat him up before he could do the joke
[15058.90s -> 15060.90s]  I think I think there was ample time
[15064.11s -> 15073.52s]  There was time
[15073.52s -> 15075.68s]  Let him do the joke
[15075.68s -> 15078.96s]  I I held the router's mastery for a long time and then I fired it
[15079.84s -> 15084.38s]  That wasn't a bad fight. Whatever he was in the equipment. I've done that before
[15086.75s -> 15100.51s]  cool
[15100.51s -> 15119.44s]  What the fuck
[15119.44s -> 15122.37s]  You're gonna do it again, aren't you? I gotta be ready
[15131.89s -> 15143.79s]  This is a sheep
[15143.79s -> 15147.58s]  Oh that hurt
[15147.58s -> 15186.16s]  I didn't even know that moves in the game. That's crazy. Good fight. That was actually pretty interesting bill
[15191.63s -> 15193.63s]  So you drink, uh
[15193.95s -> 15195.47s]  the stamina
[15195.47s -> 15201.95s]  Blast and you can just roll for like a minute. All right should be
[15205.92s -> 15216.86s]  augustin augustine sure. It's a weapon art for what weapon?
[15234.06s -> 15236.64s]  Literally roll so I didn't want to talk because I didn't want to burp
[15237.76s -> 15251.31s]  Let's do it. What the hell?
[15251.63s -> 15254.70s]  Why do they just blow up?
[15254.70s -> 15264.16s]  Holy shit, that move is actually kind of ridiculous
[15265.04s -> 15277.52s]  Oh good move
[15277.52s -> 15286.03s]  That's that move is broken pvp
[15286.99s -> 15292.42s]  Like you can't dodge it it just glues to you
[15293.14s -> 15299.73s]  That was a good fight though. I don't think you can dodge that
[15300.53s -> 15305.74s]  Can you dodge these?
[15305.74s -> 15313.44s]  That move is kind of broken. You have to roll it. You have to dodge it, huh?
[15315.47s -> 15317.47s]  Stars of ruin are a better version. Let me see
[15318.11s -> 15334.77s]  Do I have stars of ruin don't what about founding rain of stars?
[15335.81s -> 15337.81s]  These moves are useless. What the hell am I going to do with these?
[15338.69s -> 15340.69s]  Let me try founding rain of stars. I feel like that'd be weird
[15342.27s -> 15343.79s]  and
[15344.11s -> 15346.99s]  The arc onto
[15346.99s -> 15348.27s]  Get rid of this
[15348.27s -> 15351.49s]  Let's do the gravity pull
[15351.49s -> 15356.86s]  From selen's quest line. Okay. I wonder how this works. I feel like this is gonna be really annoying to deal with
[15358.06s -> 15361.92s]  All right bird brain my computer crashed when I tried to summon you last time. That's kind of scary
[15363.12s -> 15366.48s]  Bloody crow. Let's try it again bird brain. I hope you don't crash my computer again
[15366.96s -> 15370.40s]  Because i'm gonna fight you. I actually I really want to fight you. Don't crash my computer, please
[15371.79s -> 15380.94s]  please
[15380.94s -> 15392.82s]  We're good. We're good
[15392.82s -> 15414.58s]  You know what happened by now?
[15414.58s -> 15419.70s]  They probably crashed
[15419.70s -> 15423.94s]  But bird brain, i'm really sorry. It's the world does not want us to play against each other in elven ring
[15426.03s -> 15429.34s]  Yeah
[15429.34s -> 15431.26s]  I'm sorry. I think you crashed
[15431.26s -> 15434.94s]  I just our computers can't interact with each other. I might jump
[15435.98s -> 15442.19s]  Okay, like off the balcony or
[15442.75s -> 15447.30s]  What does that mean?
[15447.30s -> 15449.86s]  Who is this ghost guy that keeps running? I don't know man
[15463.42s -> 15465.26s]  All right, I might jump
[15465.26s -> 15473.81s]  You will jump
[15473.81s -> 15479.41s]  Hello. Sorry. I was like afk putting on a lip bomb
[15480.05s -> 15495.57s]  Shit I didn't get it
[15495.57s -> 15497.57s]  Actually pretty good. It's a ton of denial
[15499.74s -> 15501.74s]  Bat roll, that's not good
[15502.80s -> 15506.88s]  Oh shit. Oh, no bat roll. Must have maybe an equipment issue
[15509.58s -> 15514.64s]  damn
[15514.64s -> 15519.62s]  Okay. Good game. They only jump
[15522.00s -> 15524.37s]  Oh, I get it
[15524.37s -> 15528.37s]  Right. Okay
[15528.37s -> 15531.84s]  That makes sense now that I think about it. Okay
[15533.86s -> 15542.24s]  Uh, sure bloody crow
[15542.32s -> 15544.32s]  They're audio issues. This shouldn't be
[15544.48s -> 15553.31s]  Maybe one of the good when the crash happens screwed up nice grip
[15556.10s -> 15561.22s]  It's okay, it's kind of a disney movie comic relief character
[15591.95s -> 15593.95s]  Oh got into the magic brain
[15600.37s -> 15602.37s]  Holy shit, what's happening? I just exploded
[15604.82s -> 15606.02s]  Whoa
[15606.02s -> 15611.81s]  This exploded
[15611.81s -> 15613.81s]  This you're a little late on the snap though
[15615.26s -> 15624.00s]  You were a little late. I was already disappeared. You had to get it after this last hit boom
[15625.09s -> 15627.25s]  Because otherwise i'm already gone
[15627.81s -> 15635.44s]  That was a really cool move though
[15635.44s -> 15642.82s]  No, good game. Good game
[15642.82s -> 15652.86s]  Uh, who's next?
[15652.86s -> 15658.75s]  I was the other guys
[15658.75s -> 15660.75s]  I don't contextually. I don't know what that means
[15661.39s -> 15663.39s]  I was the other guy
[15667.26s -> 15681.46s]  Who else from the top rope? He's got the joker makeup on
[15683.68s -> 15691.36s]  perfect
[15691.36s -> 15693.36s]  Uh, bounding rain of stars is actually really good
[15694.00s -> 15703.65s]  It's just irritating
[15704.45s -> 15706.13s]  Put on your um
[15706.13s -> 15711.54s]  No, what do you got? I feel like this is a talent show. All right, what do you got for us?
[15737.34s -> 15751.81s]  Whoa, you don't have a lot of health
[15751.81s -> 15753.17s]  Hit swing
[15753.17s -> 15778.58s]  It'll hit you that move is absolutely broken in pvp. That's the new metal that thing is undodgeable
[15784.22s -> 15790.56s]  It happens so fast
[15790.96s -> 15794.75s]  Dodging that it's I mean like maybe it's just weird
[15802.19s -> 15806.19s]  All right to the next person I summon I apologize. I'm gonna be a total asshole. I just need to experiment
[15808.05s -> 15812.13s]  So i'm really sorry whoever this is. All right. I was the other guy. Sure fine
[15812.77s -> 15815.89s]  I just let you know that i'm gonna i'm gonna be a total uh total dick here
[15816.61s -> 15820.13s]  I'm just curious how this works. I mean if you if you can beat me with this, I mean then
[15820.93s -> 15823.57s]  While I do the kind of annoying cheese experiment
[15827.04s -> 15828.24s]  I could dodge it
[15828.24s -> 15834.90s]  Br josh, where's your sign?
[15834.90s -> 15844.35s]  See it br josh
[15844.43s -> 15846.91s]  It hasn't shown up. Oh, I could give you a password
[15849.79s -> 15854.27s]  All right. I was the other guy. Here's the why are you doing that?
[15855.49s -> 15860.61s]  Why why can you interact with that? I don't understand. Why did you pull this? What was the point of that?
[15863.39s -> 15867.81s]  You can interact the stuff in my world
[15867.81s -> 15869.81s]  All right. Here we go. Ready? Good luck
[15882.29s -> 15911.76s]  Dude, this is I mean honest to god. That's so horrible. That really is annoying especially in the very beginning
[15912.56s -> 15917.23s]  This is too active with non viewers
[15919.12s -> 15921.12s]  Actually, really good try though. That's really irritating
[15922.08s -> 15924.56s]  Yeah, you know, that's that's a really good point. We should go somewhere else
[15924.96s -> 15927.52s]  So we don't like kind of mess up other people's thing going on here
[15928.16s -> 15932.03s]  It's a good point. I want to place it like nobody would be but that's not
[15932.75s -> 15942.70s]  Bad to fight in go to a secret spot
[15943.84s -> 15945.60s]  Yeah, we'll go to um
[15945.60s -> 15950.62s]  What are the?
[15950.62s -> 15952.62s]  Alaketh area. No, there's a lot of people there
[15956.06s -> 15958.06s]  lake of rot underground area
[15958.70s -> 15971.90s]  This might be annoying to get back to volcano manor is good. Yeah, let's do
[15972.78s -> 15978.10s]  What about like right out here?
[15978.34s -> 15990.82s]  This isn't I mean, it's kind of an there's a lot of like
[15991.62s -> 15993.62s]  embers floating around but
[15993.62s -> 15996.50s]  Now that's that's too much. We need we need a gamer. We need to be able to see things
[15997.38s -> 16000.19s]  Turtle church, that's a good place
[16001.73s -> 16002.93s]  Yeah, that's a good one
[16002.93s -> 16015.66s]  Like right here. Yeah pat all the info is on the bottom right right here
[16016.56s -> 16021.82s]  We're inside the church
[16021.82s -> 16026.03s]  Right here. I don't want to do I don't want to accidentally kill the turtle
[16026.59s -> 16033.50s]  You guys are gonna make me founding rain of stars on the turtle and he's gonna die
[16034.30s -> 16036.05s]  All right, right here is good
[16036.05s -> 16039.31s]  Seems pretty open
[16039.31s -> 16042.45s]  Yeah, I'd say right here
[16042.45s -> 16044.42s]  uh
[16044.42s -> 16050.21s]  By josh get a password josh. I'm very curious
[16066.38s -> 16069.42s]  All right. I I don't want to show you guys the password though. So you guys can't see this
[16070.14s -> 16088.74s]  Okay, so there's multiplayer password and then there's a group password
[16089.78s -> 16104.40s]  Can I should I just change them both or keep keep one? How does it work? Is it just okay?
[16104.96s -> 16109.70s]  All right, new password is
[16110.26s -> 16113.28s]  I'm almost set
[16113.28s -> 16114.16s]  uh
[16114.16s -> 16120.56s]  Josh you understand that like the last letter can't fit so just just do just write it out and then with no last letter
[16129.79s -> 16132.10s]  All right, let's go
[16132.10s -> 16133.54s]  Josh what are you playing as?
[16133.54s -> 16140.13s]  I don't know why I thought that was I thought that was you
[16140.37s -> 16158.29s]  We got vr. Josh is uh is one of the mods for the sign
[16159.01s -> 16168.58s]  No, would you uh put your sign? There it is. You're one of these
[16169.62s -> 16173.82s]  puke barf people

[16210.72s -> 16213.09s]  You're why you're so small
[16214.53s -> 16218.21s]  Is this weird or you okay? No, that was weird. I was like, why am I so much taller than you?
[16225.12s -> 16227.12s]  All right drink drink drink drink drink

[16323.36s -> 16332.85s]  Sometimes takes a second
[16332.85s -> 16334.85s]  No refunds. I mean you bet

[16495.15s -> 16496.11s]  Oh

[16499.50s -> 16505.82s]  What is this build you've got frost poison and rot what is or blood that was that's insane
[16506.62s -> 16519.25s]  That's actually a really cool build. All right, two out of three. It's two out of three josh
[16519.97s -> 16523.28s]  You know how it works

[19124.43s -> 19135.86s]  Don't invade anybody, please. Can you avoid this attack?
[19141.23s -> 19143.23s]  I don't think I can you can't avoid this, right?
[19143.95s -> 19152.56s]  How do you avoid that lag back leg back leg back leg back leg?

[19226.43s -> 19227.95s]  What the fuck

[19230.91s -> 19238.30s]  I don't know why this keeps happening. Why does it keep happening?
[19242.75s -> 19245.31s]  Does their game keep going because I mean that you're at phase two
[19245.95s -> 19253.58s]  Are you telling me with commander neil commander neil?
[19257.74s -> 19260.78s]  Maybe just find another. Yeah, I don't know what that that's unfortunate. I'm sorry everybody
[19262.40s -> 19267.62s]  We'll go. Uh, we'll go somewhere else. I did say somebody wanted me to help with godric. Let me do that
[19269.52s -> 19271.52s]  I'm just accidentally griefing people
[19271.68s -> 19284.22s]  Fire giant has notoriously shitty netcode. Oh, that's unfortunate. All right, let me help this person with godric
[19284.86s -> 19297.76s]  I need help with neil as well
[19297.76s -> 19300.64s]  It seems like a lot of people are having trouble with neil
[19301.57s -> 19310.13s]  After godric i'll come up to neil
[19310.13s -> 19313.09s]  Uh millenia is gonna be tough because I feel like i'm gonna make that harder for everybody
[19313.73s -> 19317.46s]  It's the anti-cheat. That's wreck wrecking havoc
[19321.79s -> 19324.11s]  They said godfrey. I know somebody said godric
[19324.59s -> 19328.93s]  Somebody said godfrey, but somebody said godric a long time ago. They've probably been sitting here waiting for it
[19329.41s -> 19336.02s]  How could I make that a fight harder when you get summoned the boss gets more?
[19336.98s -> 19341.50s]  Health so if you die if I get killed by water, uh dance
[19342.46s -> 19345.15s]  In the first 15 seconds
[19345.66s -> 19349.90s]  The boss does not reduce their hp. They stay at like times two hp 50. Yeah
[19350.38s -> 19355.82s]  So if you go in if you let's say you play with your friend and you're both trying to kill, uh, millenia really badly
[19356.30s -> 19357.98s]  You summon your friend
[19357.98s -> 19361.98s]  Millenia has 50 more hp your friend dies. You're still in the game
[19362.86s -> 19366.61s]  You just made it 50 harder for you. What's the password 12 piece?
[19376.77s -> 19385.25s]  What why what's going on here respect to the?
[19386.38s -> 19390.70s]  Raya npc mod use all power consumables and launch out the comet azura at every bus
[19394.58s -> 19397.46s]  That's actually true. I could yeah, but that's kind of just like cheating, right?
[19398.18s -> 19405.42s]  Oh, you can't walk into the okay. Can't walk into the bus room
[19408.66s -> 19411.54s]  12 piece i'm going to godfrey after this
[19439.82s -> 19441.82s]  Does nobody actually need this?
[19442.22s -> 19460.72s]  If you're here and you need this to be done multiplayer use a furl calling finger remedy
[19461.04s -> 19464.77s]  You should see my make sure your password is set. It's also in that menu up in the top, right?
[19465.41s -> 19474.96s]  Oh my god, uh, it is the multiplayer password not group password
[19475.52s -> 19482.48s]  You look like albert wesker seven minutes
[19491.97s -> 19494.05s]  I I I don't know. Is it everybody? I
[19494.61s -> 19505.49s]  Whatever, please help me with the tree sentinel. I'm level nine
[19507.22s -> 19509.22s]  Well, you just you have to level up a little bit
[19514.18s -> 19516.18s]  All right, summoning sign is going right here
[19516.18s -> 19520.08s]  People are saying I need help with godric not the shade one this one
[19528.86s -> 19530.86s]  I'm level nine
[19531.98s -> 19533.98s]  So you made a new character?

[19642.86s -> 19646.88s]  No

[19665.23s -> 19672.34s]  Dude, what the fuck is happening?

[19681.97s -> 19690.42s]  What do you mean?
[19690.42s -> 19694.18s]  He wasn't taking damage. I was wondering what was with that spell
[19696.38s -> 19701.50s]  That spell was fucked. Yeah. I was like why why i've not seen that spell that was fucked
[19703.12s -> 19710.54s]  He wasn't taking damage
[19710.54s -> 19715.10s]  Okay, does anybody need to help? Uh, I don't think can we even complete one of these encounters?
[19715.74s -> 19720.74s]  Am I gonna have to go back to invasions?
[19724.94s -> 19728.98s]  He had speed

[19991.22s -> 20004.50s]  Okay, here it is
[20004.50s -> 20026.75s]  You really need help with godfrey. You're just going through so much trouble. All he wants to do is help a noob in need
[20027.73s -> 20032.88s]  yeah, I don't know this game is a hard and
[20033.52s -> 20034.72s]  if there's some

[20039.34s -> 20051.44s]  Why not ready to do this?
[20051.44s -> 20055.92s]  All right. Uh, just keep in mind that when the boss gets down to like 30 hp i'm going to disconnect apparently
[20056.56s -> 20058.94s]  So let's go
[20058.94s -> 20093.06s]  If you can handle it after it gets to that part

[20185.09s -> 20194.45s]  I wasn't ready. I think you actually didn't help him. It's all level 53 by the way, whatever relax
[20203.15s -> 20207.31s]  They have two times more hp, but they're in phase two and they got like no look. I that was my mistake. It's all right

[20802.95s -> 20804.55s]  Let's go for it
[20804.55s -> 20808.07s]  We're gonna get this
[20808.07s -> 20812.85s]  Trust me when I say that we've got it in the bag right now
[20813.33s -> 20825.59s]  Here we go. You just sit back there and cast that shit man. I got this
[20834.53s -> 20837.25s]  Just keep doing that shit. We got it. I'll watch it. Oh god

[20858.37s -> 20863.78s]  I thought I thought the staggering. I thought I was gonna get stagger
[20869.52s -> 20871.52s]  Actually griefing I
[20871.70s -> 20874.98s]  Playing this game with two people against a boss. It feels weird
[20880.68s -> 20884.36s]  Like i'm trying to fight it but like my brain is like no, it's i'm not fighting this
[20885.32s -> 20888.44s]  And sometimes they'll do like a combo where he's like one two and then he's like
[20889.08s -> 20891.08s]  You and he just comes he just comes for you
[20892.15s -> 20894.15s]  Now, you know what? It feels like how to be the boys

[20914.04s -> 20916.12s]  All right. I gotta look I gotta get in the zone here

[21037.60s -> 21040.74s]  Hooray. Oh nice job
[21042.95s -> 21045.19s]  Actually help her this time
[21045.19s -> 21048.15s]  Please help me do mine again and don't die. I feel so bad
[21049.03s -> 21052.82s]  I actually feel bad
[21052.82s -> 21055.22s]  All right, i'm gonna put it down again because there are people that need this
[21056.26s -> 21059.88s]  up with elden beast
[21059.88s -> 21064.28s]  Uh, I I hate that boss. I'm probably gonna it's i'm gonna be way worse
[21065.97s -> 21070.21s]  You do not want me to help you do elden beast. I'll get like i'll rage and like turn my stream off
[21082.00s -> 21084.26s]  All right malden
[21084.26s -> 21086.26s]  Let's get it this time. Let's go for it
[21088.42s -> 21096.36s]  No, don't apologize. That's my fault. I'm giving i'm making the boss have 50 more health and ditching you at phase two
[21097.00s -> 21133.28s]  That's not you. That's me

[21191.56s -> 21217.80s]  No, you gotta get out get out get out. Don't say it
[21229.51s -> 21232.71s]  I'm dead. I'm dead. You got it. You got it. You got this. You got this. He's got these. He's low
[21232.71s -> 21235.99s]  He's low. He's low. He's low. You got it right now. You got this you can do it
[21237.88s -> 21244.40s]  Be careful
[21244.40s -> 21249.54s]  You're so close. You can do it bro. You had two heals
[21250.26s -> 21251.24s]  What?
[21251.24s -> 21255.00s]  I had all right. I gotta get these fucking mana flasks out of here, by the way
[21255.48s -> 21257.48s]  This is stupid
[21257.86s -> 21268.10s]  All right. We need to confirm that he did it
[21268.10s -> 21271.14s]  Why do I have why am I why do I have seven mana?
[21272.96s -> 21275.76s]  Bro, I need one fucking mana flask. I need one
[21276.40s -> 21277.44s]  one
[21277.44s -> 21288.20s]  Did you get it confirmation did malden beat the boss?
[21288.76s -> 21307.01s]  He didn't I need two or it'll be zero. Oh my god
[21308.47s -> 21311.35s]  We didn't beat the boss. Oh, no, i'm so sorry. I
[21312.47s -> 21315.59s]  I come in here with three heels like an idiot
[21325.46s -> 21327.46s]  You did this it's all right. We'll get it right here
[21340.74s -> 21354.13s]  We'll get it. We'll get it the aggro talisman. I feel like that's gonna be worse
[21354.69s -> 21358.61s]  We'll find out
[21358.61s -> 21371.78s]  This is a bad idea. We got it. This is the one
[21373.70s -> 21376.18s]  Yeah, all right. We got ira and we also have malden as well
[21376.82s -> 21381.97s]  By the way, i'm not even using this so I need to put on
[21382.85s -> 21396.68s]  Let's go in case I want to cast a spell for some reason. Let's go
[21397.32s -> 21439.16s]  Really? Oh my god, I died
[21467.92s -> 21469.92s]  No phase two. What the hell is going on? All right
[21470.32s -> 21474.93s]  Let's go
[21474.93s -> 21492.04s]  Fuck you
[21492.04s -> 21494.04s]  God damn it. I'm so bad at that part
[21494.52s -> 21527.01s]  Got it. Nice job
[21527.01s -> 21528.21s]  nice work
[21528.21s -> 21539.03s]  A man of my word dual moon veil. Yeah, that's all good
[21542.40s -> 21545.12s]  All right. I got malden. I gotta take care of malden. That was
[21552.29s -> 21554.29s]  When you tried to summon me you crashed my game
[21554.77s -> 21556.77s]  and it seems to be a kind of a
[21557.68s -> 21563.99s]  Thing that happens. All right
[21563.99s -> 21565.43s]  All right malden, let's go
[21565.43s -> 21578.52s]  Where you at and then we'll go to commander neil after this. I gotta get this win for malden though. That's not that's not cool
[21584.77s -> 21600.64s]  This is so fun
[21600.64s -> 21605.08s]  Got it on the ground here. Hopefully malden didn't uh, didn't rage quit or something
[21605.56s -> 21612.61s]  That'd be sad. There we go. I've been doing nothing but co-op bosses since beating the game
[21613.17s -> 21615.86s]  It's it it definitely feels a lot different
[21617.64s -> 21620.20s]  It's like when you have a summon out but the summons there the whole time
[21620.84s -> 21623.30s]  It's really cool
[21623.30s -> 21625.30s]  What do you uh, yeah, we're doing dos
[21626.10s -> 21643.16s]  This is different. This is a different player. Okay snaggle tooth. Let's do it up with elden beast
[21645.32s -> 21648.52s]  We'll do um, I want to do a lot of people what we're talking about neil
[21650.28s -> 21681.88s]  Far away get a stagger. Come on
[21682.44s -> 21714.76s]  There it is
[21715.08s -> 21738.63s]  Phase two. Yeah, there we go. Got it bro. What happened? How did that happen? That was so weird
[21740.68s -> 21745.33s]  No
[21745.33s -> 21755.25s]  Animation continued and happened in phase two because we caught it right. That's unfair
[21756.79s -> 21768.24s]  That's unfair. That was unfair
[21772.39s -> 21775.11s]  All right, last last attempt on whatever on whoever gets it
[21775.35s -> 21782.55s]  Hopefully, uh, i'd love to do with malden and then we're gonna go to commander neil. You look really greasy. I know it's I am
[21783.80s -> 21799.76s]  Do you understand like I am like i'm a greasy fucking person. Okay, cool
[21800.32s -> 21801.20s]  oh
[21801.20s -> 21803.14s]  Stretch it out a little
[21803.14s -> 21809.43s]  All right, somebody else. I apologize to people that I couldn't beat it
[21810.07s -> 21812.76s]  It's my bad, but hopefully we get this one
[21814.58s -> 21853.25s]  That's so like loud. We're a stagger here
[21853.81s -> 21858.36s]  Can't see anything
[21862.10s -> 21914.44s]  It pulls it up right
[21919.76s -> 21920.88s]  Careful
[21920.88s -> 21944.55s]  He's dead. Oh
[21944.63s -> 21946.88s]  Boy
[21946.88s -> 21949.04s]  You gotta we gotta get him one more hit on him and he's dead
[21949.76s -> 21966.64s]  Let's go excellent work
[21967.72s -> 21973.17s]  Get it
[21973.17s -> 21974.98s]  This feels good
[21974.98s -> 21979.14s]  It doesn't feel good when you die in the first 10 seconds and you know that they have to just leave the room
[21979.78s -> 21983.75s]  Did malden do it? I don't think so
[21983.83s -> 21988.56s]  Despite you being bad at the game and dying. I enjoyed coping with you
[21991.04s -> 21997.86s]  Malden you can we get a mod confirmation of malden is still here. I tried helping malden and I died
[21999.97s -> 22001.86s]  No
[22001.86s -> 22006.92s]  Malden just can't malden can't catch a break. This is something it sucks. All right malden
[22008.50s -> 22011.46s]  Mods can we get a private password for malden, please?
[22019.92s -> 22026.04s]  Yeah, let's get up. Let's get a special password for malden. Who is malden?
[22027.09s -> 22032.64s]  Uh, he's a player and I lost twice
[22033.52s -> 22035.68s]  Well, we got him down to one hit
[22036.32s -> 22051.57s]  It's too bad. We'll get it. I'll make sure malden gets a uh gets the win here. He's the main character
[22052.37s -> 22055.76s]  Hopefully malden's here
[22055.76s -> 22057.76s]  Malden might not even actually be here
[22058.24s -> 22060.24s]  They might just be playing the game not even watching the stream
[22060.80s -> 22063.43s]  Oh, no, that's impossible because the password
[22068.02s -> 22069.06s]  anything
[22069.06s -> 22073.64s]  About 10 more seconds and then we're gonna go to uh, neil

[22501.36s -> 22515.86s]  Cheese doctor or cheese drive. I mean it's supposed to be cheese doctor, but I couldn't fit anything else
[22516.50s -> 22528.42s]  If you're just joining the stream if you'd be I don't usually use the moon veil
[22529.30s -> 22557.70s]  It's a good helper weapon
[22557.94s -> 22625.78s]  Is nobody here?
[22625.78s -> 22635.97s]  How have I not been summoned yet?
[22635.97s -> 22637.33s]  Do a diagonal
[22637.33s -> 22639.67s]  How do I do that? I know obvious
[22639.67s -> 22644.85s]  Can I even can I make a diagonal?
[22660.48s -> 22662.48s]  Rewrite the summon sign. Oh shit
[22663.68s -> 22673.30s]  I want to make a diagonal. I don't think I can make a diagonal
[22674.40s -> 22676.00s]  Transform hold on
[22676.00s -> 22679.35s]  No, you can't
[22679.35s -> 22707.43s]  Make it smaller
[22707.59s -> 22728.45s]  Hold on. I gotta add one more thing
[22764.36s -> 22766.36s]  Oh, right. It's you

[22940.58s -> 22948.96s]  It scared the shit out of me. Why did it not play before that actually scared the shit out of me?
[22948.96s -> 22958.55s]  I don't know why it didn't play before. No, fuck that joke. I thought somebody like hacked my game was in my call
[22959.27s -> 22967.22s]  I actually thought that somebody was in a call like hacked my computer or something
[22969.94s -> 22971.94s]  I know for a fact somebody else needed help with this. So
[22972.82s -> 22984.79s]  Why did it take so long? That was weird
[22991.38s -> 22998.61s]  Okay, I know there was another person that needed help with this badly. So come on. Let's do it. There we go

[23026.32s -> 23029.60s]  Well now I know why you need help with this because your character probably sucks
[23030.08s -> 23043.78s]  Who the hell what's going on? Why's my health so low? What's going on?
[23055.49s -> 23064.52s]  Bro, I don't know what you want me to do, man
[23065.16s -> 23076.88s]  You're like you're like level 15. All right, let's do it again
[23077.44s -> 23084.20s]  That way the person was level one. Oh my god, that's stupid
[23089.49s -> 23105.33s]  I was gonna say that something was off about that one. Oh jesus again. Jesus
[23106.28s -> 23109.72s]  All right, I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I don't know what he's doing. I don't he's freaking out. He's freaking me out
[23109.72s -> 23112.68s]  He's freaking me out. I don't know what he's doing. He's moving around weird. He's moving around get out get out get out get out
[23113.24s -> 23115.24s]  He's doing weird shit
[23115.24s -> 23118.37s]  All right, that was he's freaking me out. I don't like it
[23120.42s -> 23122.42s]  He was like he was going like this
[23123.51s -> 23125.51s]  That was fucking scary. I don't know what he was doing
[23126.07s -> 23137.52s]  I don't know, dude. I'm sorry. I might be freaking out but when the character's sitting there going like this
[23138.08s -> 23142.10s]  It's like okay
[23142.10s -> 23147.06s]  You're like you're hacking the game or something and like you're about to like throw up like a fucking thousand pixels on the screen
[23147.06s -> 23162.08s]  And my computer's gonna crash
[23162.08s -> 23163.92s]  All right, froggy chair
[23163.92s -> 23174.79s]  What do you say? Let's go for it
[23176.84s -> 23215.22s]  Cool good start. What are you doing? What was that?
[23233.16s -> 23234.92s]  He's exhausted
[23234.92s -> 23265.01s]  That was fucking weird
[23265.01s -> 23280.45s]  Shit, good job. All right, this should be it
[23289.99s -> 23312.93s]  Nice job. All right. So was that the person that really needed the help anybody else need help here where jesus is in chat right now
[23313.33s -> 23314.69s]  What what he what?
[23314.69s -> 23319.28s]  I don't know. You scared me. It was scary. I don't know what was going. I was scary
[23320.52s -> 23336.48s]  You look like a greaser not greasy. Oh, okay. How do you even get the name on twitch?
[23342.20s -> 23344.36s]  real
[23344.36s -> 23346.36s]  real jesus christ
[23346.92s -> 23351.12s]  I feel like I feel like that's gonna get caught by a filter eventually
[23358.23s -> 23360.23s]  That name is just so fucking weird
[23361.06s -> 23367.20s]  All right. Is this jesus? No, it's not
[23368.28s -> 23371.46s]  Whoa, that was kind of scary
[23371.46s -> 23373.46s]  The real jesus christ
[23373.70s -> 23382.47s]  That's so fucking funny
[23397.16s -> 23404.64s]  Good careful for the boss boss is right behind you man
[23405.60s -> 23408.29s]  careful for the boss
[23408.53s -> 23424.95s]  Watch out back it up. You'll be able to stagger here
[23436.66s -> 23464.26s]  Oh, no
[23464.26s -> 23476.16s]  Back it up back it up. You're good. Oh my god. I thought he died. Nice job
[23476.48s -> 23483.43s]  Imagine if the second coming happened during an elden ring stream
[23484.15s -> 23504.71s]  You're gonna play the new lego star wars didn't that like the end game already come out. I'm confused
[23505.27s -> 23517.19s]  Everybody would spam pog
[23517.19s -> 23519.83s]  There's a new one. That's is it better than the old one?
[23520.39s -> 23523.56s]  All right, maybe one more of these
[23523.56s -> 23526.52s]  One more of these and then i'm gonna wrap it up with a little bit of pvp
[23531.64s -> 23546.52s]  Just came up. It's pretty fun
[23546.52s -> 23550.20s]  The actual actual second coming of christ, but he spawned an elden ring
[23550.84s -> 23569.54s]  It includes all the new movies. All right, okay
[23570.34s -> 23571.94s]  That makes sense
[23571.94s -> 23574.10s]  Maybe we did maybe everybody is done with um
[23576.12s -> 23583.73s]  Neil are we good? Did the three or four people that needed did uh, are we good?
[23587.12s -> 23590.80s]  No help with millennia. No, that's not happening. I will ruin all your games
[23593.52s -> 23597.36s]  Okay
[23597.36s -> 23599.60s]  Okay, i'm gonna give it 10 more seconds
[23600.16s -> 23601.28s]  Here we go
[23601.28s -> 23608.93s]  Millennia is easier without help. I would imagine so
[23609.57s -> 23614.48s]  Because if she kills your co-opter and heals off of them, then you just have to deal with a way worse version
[23615.44s -> 23617.88s]  All right, ashley
[23617.88s -> 23627.48s]  cool weapon
[23627.48s -> 23629.48s]  I like the uh giddy and off near stuff
[23635.27s -> 23637.81s]  This boss is dead
[23637.81s -> 23639.73s]  Do you kill this already?
[23639.73s -> 23651.27s]  What are we doing? Where are we going? What are you gonna do?
[23653.41s -> 23657.65s]  Where do you want to go?
[23657.65s -> 23660.85s]  I'm i'm following your lead. Where where where we're going. Let's go
[23661.57s -> 23680.47s]  You didn't have to do that
[23680.47s -> 23685.30s]  You didn't have to do that. We could have just walked around. No, I kind of feel bad
[23687.60s -> 23690.24s]  Well, it was cool to see you for the few seconds that we were there
[23690.80s -> 23698.20s]  It was just a short cameo
[23698.20s -> 23699.64s]  All right, let's go to
[23699.64s -> 23702.76s]  I'm gonna do some pp. I'm gonna do moonvale pvp. I'm gonna be an asshole
[23703.40s -> 23707.83s]  We're gonna pick a spot. This is that we're gonna finish the stream this way
[23708.47s -> 23722.74s]  How about like somewhere in caitlin? We're here somewhere. I guess we could do it here
[23724.18s -> 23725.86s]  I'm not over here by virgin
[23725.86s -> 23735.70s]  Yeah, like right over here
[23735.86s -> 23738.02s]  Password is still cheese doctor. So
[23739.06s -> 23741.06s]  Your sign's down
[23741.38s -> 23746.05s]  We'll do this. I'll do another like three or four
[23746.37s -> 23752.52s]  And then i'm gonna call for today
[23752.52s -> 23754.12s]  Oh, you can't do it here
[23754.12s -> 23756.20s]  And what do you can?
[23756.20s -> 23759.70s]  Is that not I hear is that wrong?
[23762.31s -> 23765.25s]  okay, um, how about
[23772.50s -> 23778.32s]  That church of vows was pretty good spot. Yeah, this was a good spot
[23778.88s -> 23789.72s]  We're outside. We're ever gonna do this again. I don't know. I mean, this is really fun
[23790.61s -> 23792.61s]  You guys want to do this again, I would definitely do it again
[23793.09s -> 23805.78s]  This was a good spot
[23805.78s -> 23808.10s]  All right. We have an uh, we have actual psycho
[23809.46s -> 23813.36s]  I'm gonna do moon veil. I'm curious how it is
[23813.76s -> 23818.04s]  Even it makes me an asshole
[23818.04s -> 23826.80s]  Sorry, what's today? Stay saturday
[23833.48s -> 23840.23s]  Actually might not be able to stream tomorrow. We don't have to do dos on monday. I don't know why I thought it was friday
[23840.79s -> 23842.15s]  I thought it was friday
[23842.15s -> 23850.37s]  Did I?
[23850.37s -> 23856.69s]  Summon somebody I just did all right this barf drinker again. We might uh do a rematch. All right a gamer boy
[23857.57s -> 23865.83s]  Do I have a backup save?
[23865.83s -> 23867.83s]  Um, I think i'm fine. I'm okay
[23867.91s -> 23872.04s]  there's been like one or two hackers, but it was just like kind of I mean it was
[23872.68s -> 23874.52s]  It was pretty funny
[23874.52s -> 23876.52s]  It was just like insanity
[23876.84s -> 23885.64s]  I don't mind people just kind of fucking having fun as long as as long as nobody like actually tries to you know
[23885.64s -> 23887.80s]  Hey break my game or something, but you know
[23891.14s -> 23892.02s]  Hello
[23892.02s -> 23897.68s]  Did we confirm that jesus christ was a hacker? I mean
[23898.40s -> 23900.40s]  in the video game
[23900.64s -> 23904.92s]  That's unbelievable. All right. Okay. All right. All right. I'll take it
[23906.20s -> 23911.33s]  Okay, i'll take it up. I'll take it. It's my
[23913.12s -> 23917.76s]  Oh, hi. Yeah, you can heal by the way. Yeah, that weapon's fucking awful. That weapon's unbelievable
[23918.08s -> 23920.24s]  But good luck dealing with uh, good luck dealing with this
[23921.60s -> 23934.76s]  All right, you can heal again. You can heal again. You can that's that's really stupid. You can heal again heal again
[23939.35s -> 23943.75s]  All right, I just I got I healed so you should heal too. Let's just start over
[23944.39s -> 23947.14s]  Let's just start just start over just start over start over
[23947.78s -> 23949.60s]  That wasn't fair

[24010.44s -> 24021.72s]  I was wondering why because I was the spin actually was pretty that that was doing work
[24023.59s -> 24028.45s]  Uh good game though
[24028.53s -> 24040.88s]  Fucking stupid. All right
[24041.36s -> 24043.36s]  Now i'm ready to pvp
[24053.43s -> 24061.09s]  Done you actually have a gun
[24061.09s -> 24063.09s]  Do you think jesus has ever?
[24063.33s -> 24066.52s]  bl jade
[24066.52s -> 24068.52s]  and wait, you mean like
[24068.68s -> 24070.68s]  wait like the
[24072.39s -> 24082.05s]  That thing that means right? Wait, do you think jesus is going like
[24086.55s -> 24090.40s]  Probably I would make it would make sense. All right, how are you? Let's do it
[24091.94s -> 24102.05s]  I weren't ready for the fucking rain of stars
[24102.77s -> 24127.09s]  Where are you going?
[24127.09s -> 24129.09s]  Yo, oh, that was cool. All right
[24129.65s -> 24131.59s]  goodbye
[24131.59s -> 24132.95s]  damn
[24132.95s -> 24134.15s]  Okay
[24134.15s -> 24140.61s]  That person looks like they had a camera
[24140.61s -> 24144.77s]  They're just snapping pictures of us
[24158.16s -> 24165.09s]  gg. Good game. All right, let's get a good one here
[24166.78s -> 24168.00s]  helicopter
[24168.00s -> 24175.25s]  Kind of need to know and you need to know what the helicopter character looks like
[24178.77s -> 24180.77s]  I think i'm not doing spells. I think it's gonna go just two handed
[24181.41s -> 24186.66s]  This is an exploit
[24186.74s -> 24200.23s]  Whatever. Hey, hello
[24200.23s -> 24242.04s]  Dude, you got nice recovery though. It's gonna be close
[24248.10s -> 24249.22s]  Oh
[24249.22s -> 24251.01s]  Good game
[24251.01s -> 24252.61s]  Who died first?
[24252.61s -> 24254.45s]  Who died first?
[24254.45s -> 24255.41s]  Oh
[24255.41s -> 24259.24s]  Oh, we got a tie
[24259.24s -> 24275.75s]  That was cool build. I still have the aggro ring on. Oh, that's right. This is no I don't yeah. I do
[24276.31s -> 24278.21s]  What was on there before?
[24278.21s -> 24284.07s]  Physical damage, uh, I think it was magic damage
[24286.32s -> 24296.08s]  Yeah, put it
[24296.08s -> 24297.99s]  Oh
[24297.99s -> 24299.99s]  Operator turned into atmosphere
[24301.33s -> 24303.94s]  I'm for it. Let's go
[24303.94s -> 24312.44s]  We hear shito
[24312.44s -> 24326.74s]  Uh, yeah, we keep cheese doctor as the community password after the stream. Yeah, that sounds good
[24327.38s -> 24329.17s]  How are you?
[24329.17s -> 24338.36s]  That's a weird move
[24338.36s -> 24352.71s]  Whoa
[24352.71s -> 24357.62s]  Holy shit. Nice. Okay mode that that was weird
[24358.66s -> 24372.13s]  There's a little purple thing. Okay. Arian slicer is really good. Don't I have it? Do I like dairy queen?
[24372.69s -> 24374.69s]  It yeah, it's fine. It's good
[24392.47s -> 24400.18s]  Would gigachad have that weapon I feel like gigachad would use like the big hammer
[24400.74s -> 24469.73s]  How are you? Holy shit. Oh my god
[24472.24s -> 24474.24s]  Oh, that was so close. Nice fight
[24475.28s -> 24478.40s]  That move what that move did almost 100% of my health
[24478.96s -> 24480.64s]  That was ridiculous
[24480.64s -> 24501.28s]  That is how much I had left. Good fight. I mean barf drinker has been patiently waiting. All right
[24501.52s -> 24509.33s]  Why do I get so tired all of a sudden? I'm like tired
