[1.34s -> 18.42s]  Hello, how's everybody doing? Welcome back to streamer of the week. That's me. I won the uh
[18.98s -> 27.26s]  just want to make sure I won the 2016 streamer of the week award. I like to announce that every
[27.26s -> 38.57s]  stream just so people are aware. I played Minecraft for like a couple hours and I built a cool snowman
[38.57s -> 50.18s]  looked just like Olaf and it was it was an honor. But welcome to another VR stream. Hope you're
[50.18s -> 60.18s]  well rested. Just put on my uh utility belt on my hands and we'll get started. Give me one second.
[60.18s -> 109.56s]  So I wanted to try and see if I could get more of the room here.
[112.76s -> 125.58s]  God, because when I that's a little bit more wide, right? Oh well you can like see that shit. I want
[125.58s -> 136.63s]  to get let me move that like this so you can see more of the room. I'll go like that. Why don't
[136.63s -> 142.79s]  you turn this way? There we go. Okay, so now I've got the complaint. I got a lot of complaints,
[142.79s -> 147.27s]  okay? Last stream where once I got to be about here I wasn't in frame anymore
[148.39s -> 152.23s]  and then once I got to be about here I also wasn't in frame anymore and we've got full
[152.23s -> 161.90s]  widescreen now. Ain't you understand? People were complaining. I got emails. So there we go. See
[163.37s -> 168.70s]  now no matter where I am you should be able to see me across your entire television set.
[170.12s -> 181.59s]  Isn't that something? I also got a haircut. What do you think? My twitch chat back here.
[184.76s -> 187.88s]  Too short? Well you can't you can't that's you can't even see it. That's the joke.
[188.60s -> 193.69s]  Glad you laughed at it. But anyways let me get started here. We're gonna play Gorn. This is the
[193.69s -> 200.60s]  first game we're gonna play is Gorn and let's make sure that you can see this. Otherwise I'm
[200.60s -> 212.33s]  gonna be in big trouble and hey look at that. All right now this is gonna be hard to drink.
[213.05s -> 218.09s]  Coffee. Wait let me make sure because sometimes I get here but is that a good widescreen display?
[220.57s -> 224.41s]  You know what I'm saying? Like if I'm gonna say I'm going to walk this way it's gonna happen.
[225.21s -> 233.27s]  That's a good display right? I'm just concerned if I like stand here.
[233.27s -> 237.82s]  I'll just be like where I'm supposed to be like right here. This is perfect all right.
[241.13s -> 247.86s]  Tilt the camera down. Now if I tilt the camera down you'll get to see like below the belt
[249.69s -> 253.45s]  and then if I like this is like the only place it can be because if I stand here
[254.17s -> 257.61s]  then like look at this shit. Like I'm cut off over there. It's gotta be.
[259.66s -> 268.70s]  Like I think that's perfect. I have to go down so I can show feet. I don't think so.
[269.26s -> 273.67s]  Yeah what if I do it a little bit. I don't want I don't want this real estate to be that much
[273.67s -> 279.37s]  taken up. You know what I mean? We'll do a little bit. All right I'm stalling long enough. Let me
[279.37s -> 286.15s]  get my hands in here. Welcome to another edition of fucking boomer plays virtual games.
[287.03s -> 295.35s]  Hot dogs horseshoes and hand grenades is what we're doing next. All right you don't think I
[295.35s -> 309.32s]  got that queued up already? All right let's go. I'm going in. Oh no I'm not. Which one of these
[309.32s -> 317.59s]  goes in? So Goren from my understanding it's uh it's a game where you you have a farm
[318.95s -> 325.03s]  and your your grandfather dies and then the farm is then given to you and you can buy like uh
[325.03s -> 330.07s]  cabbage. There's like parsley. You you have to like press buttons on on wood to get wood to build
[330.07s -> 337.56s]  stuff. It's something like that. That's what at least I think. There's a bunch of towns people
[337.56s -> 341.40s]  I guess that you can make friends with and you can like romance them. It's kind of an interesting
[341.40s -> 352.94s]  experience I guess. All right let me say that. Can I say you guys? Hey there you are. Move hand here.
[355.05s -> 366.39s]  Press and hold to wait move hand here. Press and hold to grab world. Pull hold and pull world.
[367.03s -> 375.48s]  I hate this already. I look like a different game. I don't like to like rowboat mechanic already.
[376.12s -> 397.69s]  Is this supposed to be going faster? I have to ski. I'm doing something wrong right?
[398.41s -> 416.34s]  What am I doing wrong here? Uh that's not correct. What is going on?
[419.74s -> 426.15s]  Hold on. Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait. I got like strapped in already.
[426.87s -> 438.57s]  Fucking hand straps. I'm gonna make a VR room. I'm just gonna have it be just padded. There's
[438.57s -> 447.43s]  rubber all over the place. That's not correct still. I'm gonna have like pillows on the ground
[447.43s -> 453.83s]  and then you won't need a wrist strap. I will construct a $14,000 room to not have to wear
[453.83s -> 473.32s]  these. All right okay. How are we doing huh? Rich. He's rich. All right well there we go.
[473.32s -> 478.94s]  I could die like I have to swim. All right grab the big Willy Wonka lever and pull it.
[483.50s -> 491.37s]  Gorn. So this is a game where you. You think you are special. Do you even know fight?
[492.34s -> 506.02s]  Uh make a fist. So I'm trying to do the Julius Caesar thumbs down.
[507.54s -> 515.98s]  Jump. Fight. Let's see. I just punch him in the face.
[520.06s -> 527.91s]  Raise your hands. Victory is yours. Oh I get gold coins. All right so that's that's how you do. How
[527.91s -> 536.07s]  do you move though? Do I have to like pull the world to move still? Dreamer kills someone. I
[536.07s -> 540.55s]  didn't kill anybody. Here we go. Movement options. That's what I'm talking about. Get over there.
[544.44s -> 550.92s]  Like an old man with a cane. What's that say? Movement options. I'm not sure. Does this one
[550.92s -> 556.86s]  come with guacamole? What about this one? I don't want any. I don't want any extra beans in that.
[556.86s -> 562.14s]  Like I'm an old fucking man like a moze. All right graphics options.
[565.14s -> 579.96s]  Huh? Do I have to like take the secret cube? Oh for the love of god.
[582.62s -> 588.62s]  Blur. Nope. Persistent blood armor shatter smooth camera on monitor. What the fuck does that mean?
[593.85s -> 604.71s]  Uh strict chaperone. Out of here. Strict chaperone. My ass. Movement grab and pull.
[605.59s -> 612.49s]  Rotation on comfort mode. What does that mean? Gameplay options.
[615.18s -> 632.23s]  Enter the demo. Difficulty normal. Slow mo on kill. I just keep it default. That's fine. Tier one.
[633.03s -> 642.68s]  Berserker. General. Okay you do one of them main. That's just the off game. Toggle hold.
[643.80s -> 655.86s]  Movement hold and gesture is this one. Endless. Is that me? All right let's go to tier one. So hold
[655.86s -> 675.85s]  is hold. Let's go to that. Let's tier one. Berserker. Let's go. I'm doing something wrong.
[678.15s -> 683.19s]  Please please. Whoa whoa whoa. Smooth. Smooth. The love of god. Smooth camera. For the love of god.
[688.54s -> 712.17s]  Oh now I get it. Is this why it looks like this? This kinda hurts my eyes. Movement graphics options.
[715.43s -> 734.71s]  Smooth camera on monitor. Is it better? Is that better? Movement options.
[737.70s -> 752.12s]  Is this like frame rate or am I insane? Turn off whole world. Movement. Grip button.
[754.47s -> 763.32s]  HMD oriented. Controller oriented. Pull. Grip button. It might be the frame rate. I don't
[763.32s -> 774.26s]  know why it's like this. It is pretty laggy. Controller oriented. Yeah it is like a little
[774.26s -> 790.14s]  frame rating. So controller oriented. What does that mean? Check the fps. Maybe it's something
[790.14s -> 804.60s]  to do with like this. Hold on. What if I do this? Is that better? Not really. Don't ask me why.
[808.36s -> 819.16s]  Try lowering the graphics. I don't think I can. Last time with like graphic and frame rate problems.
[820.04s -> 824.74s]  Maybe it's just the game maybe in the menu here. Make a middle finger with the controller.
[826.01s -> 832.44s]  Oh okay I can move like this. I get it. With my thumb. Alright that's cool. Let's just get in
[832.44s -> 835.40s]  the game and see what happens. I want to see if the graphics are just like fucked up or something.
[835.40s -> 838.36s]  Because it's like this looks really kind of terrible.
[853.48s -> 860.36s]  You think you have what it takes to survive? Let's see. Win your first challenge then you
[860.36s -> 867.48s]  will become a fighter. Alright grab club. Hold your weapon and salute. Yeah this is not this is
[867.48s -> 878.65s]  not right. Like at all. Look at that. This is not supposed to look like this. Why does this look
[878.65s -> 893.45s]  like this? This is awful. Try a different game. Yeah this is like that just doesn't look right.
[893.45s -> 914.30s]  I gotta get out of here. Turn off the motion smoothing. Allocate more rim. Um this is
[914.30s -> 921.61s]  unfortunate. This is the game. This game is supposed to be really fucking good. So why like
[921.61s -> 925.37s]  everything over there looks normal. Like up there? No it doesn't. The whole game looks fucked up.
[925.37s -> 931.13s]  Looking like it's like wiggling around and shit. Nope. Goodbye. No get me out of this.
[931.21s -> 936.33s]  Let's go look at the ground. Like the whole game is is like jellyfish wiggling around.
[936.97s -> 946.98s]  That's not correct. Give me a sec. That doesn't make any sense. You think you have what it takes
[946.98s -> 955.18s]  to survive? Win your first challenge then you will become a fighter. Let me let home. Shield your
[955.18s -> 968.09s]  eyes. Hold your weapon and salute. This doesn't make any fucking sense. That's how the game is?
[970.25s -> 980.70s]  Just restart steam VR. Yeah just restart it. That's weird. Did you turn up super sampling? I
[980.70s -> 991.70s]  didn't do anything. Dev said on steam discussion page the latest update brought frame rate issues.
[993.06s -> 1007.58s]  Really? Well that's kind of unfortunate. Screen smoothing is off. I turned it off.
[1007.58s -> 1016.12s]  I turned off screen smoothing. Uh well for the purposes of just getting this going
[1020.30s -> 1026.46s]  use an older version. How the hell am I gonna do that? How do I use an older version of the game?
[1026.46s -> 1038.36s]  You can't like go where we're gonna how do I get an older version of Gorn? Right click properties
[1038.36s -> 1053.86s]  versions. I'm gonna have betas. Manual enable steam overlay is just unchecked. Nah nah this is
[1053.86s -> 1062.09s]  fucked up. Hello everyone. We've received a number of reports about performance issues affecting some
[1062.09s -> 1066.81s]  people since the update. While we've been able to we have been unable to reproduce these issues of
[1066.81s -> 1071.93s]  our own we've investigated as much as we can and did we can and did another update now to address
[1071.93s -> 1076.01s]  these problems. If you're having performance issues since this update can you please try the
[1076.01s -> 1084.04s]  current version and let us know if the issue has been resolved. This is literally from two days ago.
[1084.04s -> 1096.30s]  Uh I don't think it fixed it. Oh it's literally. Well um we're gonna have to go back to this I
[1096.30s -> 1108.49s]  think. Unless like let's go betas none. Nah there are no betas here. I think they updated the game
[1108.49s -> 1114.81s]  today. Well that's unfortunate. Let's go play hot dogs, horses, and hand grenades. I'll come back
[1114.81s -> 1129.42s]  to Gorn. Give me a sec while I open it up. Oh fuck did I lose my uh did I seriously lose my
[1129.42s -> 1138.86s]  OVR drop? What the hell? Oh god damn it. That's a pain in the ass. I was ready to go too. Come on.
[1138.86s -> 1159.77s]  What a bunch of bullshit. Hold on. You gotta be kidding me. I have to like set this back up again.
[1160.49s -> 1169.32s]  This is what we call a pain in the ass guys. I'm gonna put this up for a minute.
[1171.02s -> 1187.46s]  Fucking Gorn. How come I can't do this now? Now the controls aren't turned on. That would help.
[1194.12s -> 1205.58s]  Hold on. Sorry this is happening. Yep. Oh my god why are you doing this? Why I was ready to play
[1207.00s -> 1213.48s]  this motherfucker. And now like I have oh my god I'm so pissed off right now.
[1214.04s -> 1237.37s]  I was ready to play. It's done. We were good to go. How am I gonna get this now? Oh that's way too
[1237.37s -> 1256.31s]  big. And play 03. I had to save too. Why? Why is this so huge? This is like gigantic. All right
[1256.31s -> 1280.09s]  there we go. Okay let's open up hot dogs, heroes, and hand grenades. I don't know what the game is.
[1294.65s -> 1299.00s]  Here it comes. There should be an update like two days ago that breaks this game too.
[1299.00s -> 1307.90s]  Here see we did like an update and like now like some people just can't play it.
[1307.90s -> 1324.12s]  Who fucking knows what the problem is? Hot dogs. Hot dogs, horseshoes, and hand grenades.

[8159.40s -> 8169.51s]  buck bullets okay on pick up your starting equipment yeah i hope you guys are ready get
[8169.51s -> 8173.19s]  loot that's a good one that's actually a pretty good one so again what's gonna happen is i'm
[8173.19s -> 8177.51s]  gonna be standing here i'm gonna look that way i'm gonna read the instructions i'm gonna say
[8178.87s -> 8183.27s]  uh take an old setup you're starting where does it say loot where does it say loot
[8185.94s -> 8190.66s]  difficulty item doesn't say loot there it is loot progression okay so you guys know what to do
[8192.65s -> 8197.29s]  so i'm gonna i'm gonna introduce the scene i say oh playing take and hold this is a

[17590.09s -> 17603.14s]  essay no i think it's because of the this game this game is incredibly intense all right well
[17603.14s -> 17609.27s]  sorry that we're dropping frames but i can really only realistically play this game for like another
[17610.73s -> 17630.38s]  maybe like another 20 to 30 minutes let's go back in a new game we'll see how i feel i've been in it

[20643.90s -> 20647.34s]  to start by saying that i'm really sorry for blowing everyone's eardrums out with my bits last
[20647.34s -> 20651.26s]  stream i have no excuses and i'm not expecting forgiveness but i want you to know that i'm
[20651.26s -> 20656.70s]  genuinely sorry i don't know what i was thinking when i said that i was an idiot i took advantage
[20656.70s -> 20660.94s]  of the trust you have for your chat and i know it's unforgivable but know that i'm sorry i've
[20660.94s -> 20679.35s]  learned my lesson and it will not happen again three day ban is up uh if it happens again that's
[20679.35s -> 20691.90s]  uh that's that's goodbye it's uh you know boink out of town he's supposed to post a link to an
[20691.90s -> 20702.18s]  even even louder video in that message thank you binary man i know you're just messing around you're
[20702.18s -> 20707.69s]  just fucking around i know but you gotta remember if people aren't prepared for the noise that loud
[20708.57s -> 20715.48s]  you know you could fucking actually mess up somebody's head you could blow out an ear you
[20715.48s -> 20721.00s]  could fuck up a speaker you just gotta remember you're dealing with people just like you you know
[20721.00s -> 20726.04s]  would you want your speaker blown out i don't think you would what have you had it up loud
[20726.84s -> 20733.13s]  no you couldn't yeah you could you could like it would be the subwoofer will just blow out
[20733.77s -> 20737.69s]  and the tube in the middle will just fly out at like 100 miles per hour it's dangerous shit
[20741.58s -> 20750.06s]  but thank you binary uh commando i think commando uh commando nom thanks for the two bucks
[20751.03s -> 20754.39s]  i found someone on deviantart who makes stuffed animals and i'm gonna pay him
[20754.39s -> 20770.52s]  in march to make a stuffed animal of you well uh that's i hope you have uh i don't even know how
[20770.52s -> 20777.16s]  to say anything without out of context just being bad i um that is a thing that you're going to buy
[20778.12s -> 20785.94s]  that you're gonna get made i just hope you don't stick needles in it while chanting and trying to
[20785.94s -> 20796.86s]  hurt me if anything like if you're gonna do that if you're gonna do like uh like a curse or something
[20797.74s -> 20804.86s]  just like put me in like a nice warm bath right dude nobody does nice shit with one of those
[20804.86s -> 20812.39s]  dolls you know open up like cook bacon and then hold me up and just kind of swirl me around over
[20812.39s -> 20828.14s]  where the bacon is cooking so i can smell it give me a nice warm bath do nice things what do you
[20828.14s -> 20834.15s]  mean that's worse you don't think if you just woke up in the morning randomly one day and you could
[20834.15s -> 20839.99s]  just smell bacon you'd be like wow it smells like bacon in here this is delicious and i guess that
[20839.99s -> 20843.59s]  would be kind of worse because then you would go to wherever your kitchen was thinking somebody made
[20843.59s -> 20850.49s]  bacon and they didn't on second thought just stab me with the knives that's probably better pluck
[20850.57s -> 20859.99s]  out his chest hairs play loud videos to the doll it just put my ear up to his speaker
[20861.30s -> 20869.02s]  you guys are fucking vicious why would you want to do that to me what chest hairs i got plenty
[20873.45s -> 20879.93s]  but thank you commando thank you uh cougar for the one dollar germa germa germa gimme gimme gimme
[20880.65s -> 20893.59s]  a hernia a alec thanks to the one dollar is an htc vibe a good investment a yes it is
[20896.25s -> 20899.77s]  i would put the 100 stamp of recommendation and approval on
[20899.77s -> 20910.94s]  the vibe just the last three sessions alone was worth the five six hundred dollar investment
[20910.94s -> 20916.20s]  to play it because it's a lot different i mean i know i know some of you guys have probably played
[20916.20s -> 20920.28s]  it at conventions or at a friend's house or something but when you have it in your own room
[20921.08s -> 20925.96s]  and you can just go in and play it it's a lot different than just doing like uh i guess i'm
[20925.96s -> 20934.54s]  like gonna do this for like 10 minutes what's this demo it's a lot more fun now what i would
[20934.54s -> 20941.42s]  tell you somebody just already mentioned it valve and htc they are coming out with a new one it's
[20941.42s -> 20952.78s]  called the cosmo right the htc vibe cosmo it's not out yet but it might be a different maybe
[20952.78s -> 20958.17s]  potentially better version of the one that currently exists i don't know they're not
[20958.73s -> 20970.18s]  discontinuing the regular one from what i know yeah the htc cosmo it's that is not valve that's
[20970.18s -> 20989.40s]  htc only well uh they announced it very recently so we'll see cosmos is different valve has their
[20989.40s -> 20998.22s]  own in development really so there's going to be a cosmos and a new valve only made one
[21001.11s -> 21004.23s]  uh you you kind of making too many you know you got that's gonna be four
[21005.03s -> 21019.86s]  that's a little weird because there's five five pro cosmos and then whatever valve is doing because
[21019.86s -> 21029.88s]  i know they're not getting rid of the old ones they're not gonna finish it maybe not but we'll
[21029.88s -> 21044.26s]  see what they do but anyways we had uh yeah i would say yes it is currently for the standard
[21044.34s -> 21051.38s]  default five it's 499 but if you like me you're kind of going to need an accessory or two
[21052.66s -> 21058.10s]  i had to get two stands to hold the lighthouses because i couldn't put them they weren't that i
[21058.10s -> 21066.07s]  couldn't clamp them anywhere so that was another like 60 bucks plus if you want a couple extra
[21066.07s -> 21069.27s]  lighthouses you know who knows it depending on how big your room is or what you want to do with it
[21070.23s -> 21081.03s]  it could cost between five and seven hundred bucks or wireless if you want to get the wireless
[21081.03s -> 21091.64s]  thing that's 299 which i like think i have to get it it almost makes it necessary when you're trying
[21091.64s -> 21100.28s]  to do a room scale thing sitting down sure i don't think it's necessary or standing only but doing
[21100.28s -> 21105.85s]  like the two or three steps forward and backwards and turning around 360 i think i have to get it
[21106.73s -> 21115.91s]  you can get some elgato lights for cheaper than that uh but these i mean these ones came with
[21115.91s -> 21129.75s]  a bundle so maybe you can i don't know but thank you too uh where were we here alec uh d jack thanks
[21129.75s -> 21134.63s]  for the two dollars and 49 cents thanks for all the laughs mr funny man thank you for being here

[21155.72s -> 21165.26s]  too i guess it just kind of something was wrong with the new update or something we'll try it
[21165.26s -> 21180.65s]  again next time we do uh vibe but it does look very fun thank you topac for the 250 uh check out
[21180.65s -> 21183.77s]  what chat drew of you i've pre-screened it so it's nothing to worry about

[21261.11s -> 21269.06s]  no it works it's not a picture it's a website it could be dynamic and change to a screamer
[21269.06s -> 21276.12s]  at any time i linked flinstone's porn no that that that did not happen
[21276.92s -> 21290.52s]  i think we broke the site the site we may have accidentally just took it down
[21297.45s -> 21300.73s]  yeah that was so fucked up like barney was getting cooked or something it was
[21300.73s -> 21308.46s]  really fucking weird it was horrifying they were like eating each other it was very very very
[21308.46s -> 21319.75s]  graphic and horrible i didn't even do that i went to i searched for something don't have a search
[21319.75s -> 21336.04s]  for anybody ever that actually yeah that did actually happen like a year ago but thank you

[21362.41s -> 21373.11s]  yeah probably a lot of new people probably have no idea
[21374.79s -> 21377.35s]  it's been with some weird shit on this stream that's for sure
[21379.11s -> 21383.77s]  hey smiter thanks for the one dollar demonic cucumber thanks for the two dollars and 50 cents

[21434.60s -> 21443.85s]  yeah the vr case files looks fun i'll probably end up doing that at some point soon
[21446.50s -> 21454.97s]  but yes the message whatever you want to write if you whatever the message is that has to be

[21729.90s -> 21736.54s]  he was yelling at people throwing cereal on the floor opening up toys and breaking them stealing
[21736.54s -> 21740.14s]  and eating candy bars you should have a talk with shido and with kim about his behavior
[21741.18s -> 21757.59s]  i'll talk to him i'll find out what happened he's acting out for some reason i don't know why
[21757.59s -> 21769.11s]  i think he's in some kind of phase shida would never do that i have to i gotta confirm that
[21769.11s -> 21774.92s]  story with kim it's important but thank you sir rock for the two dollars fifty cents
[21775.72s -> 21780.52s]  thank you jess you got it for the 250 i would love to see a stream in the middle of nowhere
[21780.52s -> 21787.80s]  in vegas just you and a table of guns teaching gun safety well that's definitely never gonna
[21787.80s -> 21794.04s]  happen because i do not necessarily know anything about how to handle a firearm so i would never
[21794.76s -> 21799.96s]  ever operate one without the proper guidance and safety procedures and i would never teach anybody
[21800.68s -> 21804.76s]  anything about gun safety because i know i there's no way i'd be able to tell you anything
[21804.76s -> 21808.68s]  i would have to step out of the way and have a professional go over safety
[21809.64s -> 21820.14s]  that's the point why would i ever do that you'd like to know what that's such a terrible awful
[21820.14s -> 21833.46s]  idea you definitely seem like an expert after today's stream your dog there's a little dog down

[21860.22s -> 21869.46s]  hours i really should have gone back and tried it because i figured out all the nuances of the
[21869.46s -> 21876.17s]  game at that point that's cheeto i think it actually might be cheeto that's weird
[21876.89s -> 21889.24s]  maybe he is acting on i'm learning how to bark too but thank you daring ocelot for the two bucks
[21890.04s -> 21896.73s]  cypress 74 thanks for the ten dollars go to sandbox and learn them yeah i eventually figured

[22343.59s -> 22348.39s]  aka the desert take kim and italics to a shooting range and just try it out it's kind of relaxing
[22348.39s -> 22356.30s]  you shoot the shit literally i have i have been to a range before i have shot a firearm before
[22356.30s -> 22369.45s]  at a range a couple of years ago i've shot a nine millimeter a
[22371.54s -> 22378.50s]  some type of sub machine gun some type of rifle and i was too afraid to shoot the shotgun i was
[22378.50s -> 22390.87s]  afraid so i didn't do it it was very scary i didn't want to do it it was a very powerful
[22390.87s -> 22401.70s]  shotgun and i'm like i don't know if i want to do that some some guy in there shot this huge
[22402.58s -> 22409.74s]  huge sniper rifle and actually what they what they tell you that everybody has to stop so
[22409.74s -> 22415.02s]  everybody just kind of hangs back and just waits because this giant huge high caliber sniper rifle
[22415.98s -> 22422.62s]  we you have ear protection on first of all right and this thing you only get to shoot it one time
[22422.62s -> 22432.30s]  at this place and holy crap when that thing is fired you can feel it wind hits you in the face
[22432.94s -> 22437.58s]  and like your chest you feel like a boom deep inside of your chest it's wild
[22442.71s -> 22449.10s]  it was it was it definitely was an experience there was a room with probably maybe 20 30 people
[22449.10s -> 22453.99s]  all at this range and we all were just kind of sitting there like wait for it wait for it here
[22453.99s -> 22460.66s]  it goes boom and you the whole place just shakes the 50 caliber pressure wave yeah
[22466.18s -> 22474.71s]  no it was it was interesting would i do it again i don't maybe yeah i don't i don't see like
[22475.43s -> 22481.18s]  as long as it was a safe place and he was you know they did things by the book and they had a lot of
[22481.18s -> 22495.29s]  the procedures were good right they usually are my dad paid ten dollars for me to shoot one bullet
[22495.29s -> 22505.75s]  out of a barrett 50 caliber maybe that's what it was there's a shotgun called a 410 that is fun
[22506.55s -> 22515.03s]  i don't know i definitely wanted to like experience it at least once that was the idea
[22518.22s -> 22530.79s]  use a varmint rifle no it was cool it was cool but also a little nerve-wracking too because
[22530.79s -> 22536.87s]  you're just like somebody that i don't really handle guns or weapons ever so when they you
[22536.87s -> 22541.35s]  know it's like okay stand here and you're like yeah okay hey hold that it's like heavy and you're
[22541.35s -> 22546.63s]  like okay so and over here oh oh just hold it up okay but you're gonna be explaining everything
[22546.63s -> 22550.07s]  and you know you're listening and you're paying attention and you're sitting there going like
[22550.07s -> 22561.90s]  i'm gonna fire this i'm gonna fire this at the target and what's gonna happen it sounds
[22561.90s -> 22568.30s]  stressful the first like three or four shots at a range is pretty stressful but once you
[22568.46s -> 22572.62s]  because look it's an if you've never done it before you don't even know what to expect
[22573.42s -> 22581.80s]  it ain't like a fucking movie you know what i mean you gotta like control you gotta like be very very
[22581.80s -> 22584.52s]  attentive you have to pay the fuck attention because everything you're doing
[22585.40s -> 22605.94s]  shaky hands very interesting stuff though yeah attentive just hearing you talk about it is
[22605.94s -> 22610.98s]  stressing me out well i have i haven't really done it since no i have like that was i did it once
[22611.62s -> 22625.45s]  that was about two and a half years ago it was very different but there you go thank you flank
[22625.45s -> 22633.34s]  tank door cube thanks for the two dollars and 50 cents door cube not sure if you noticed but
[22633.34s -> 22643.56s]  you did something weird during that horseshoes and hot dogs game take a look what did i that's

[22659.24s -> 22666.09s]  250 the dev added a super secret mode called extreme spin mode where your body angles to
[22666.09s -> 22672.46s]  the ground so you stand on and spin you in the direction of the jets i'm pretty good in vr and
[22672.46s -> 22678.26s]  almost made me projectile vomit yeah i feel bad that that's kind of what we ended on
[22679.72s -> 22684.76s]  because somebody did say that more than a thousand people left the stream after 10-15
[22684.76s -> 22690.52s]  minutes of being in that game so actually it's probably better to end on that because
[22690.52s -> 22698.81s]  we've been going for about four and a half hours anyways so probably better to end it
[22698.81s -> 22705.99s]  than start on it that game is really cool though i'm gonna have i have to go back and play that
[22705.99s -> 22713.56s]  one again because sometimes it was a little too much but as long as you can kind of power
[22713.56s -> 22724.82s]  through it it was really really really fun but thank you future gamer with the 250 thank you
[22724.82s -> 22729.94s]  bingo sunshine sunshine for the five dollars germany if a vr game is making you sick stop
[22729.94s -> 22734.34s]  playing it don't keep making yourself sick for an hour plus laughing my ass off
[22737.32s -> 22746.41s]  it was fine it was fun look you guys know me pretty well at this point if something is not
[22746.97s -> 22754.44s]  okay with me on this stream it goes off or it changes especially something like that
[22755.00s -> 22764.57s]  so if i was really having a problem that i've really had to stop i absolutely would have so

[22813.35s -> 22823.42s]  against the terms of service it has to be you probably get 24 hours imagine that's like the
[22823.42s -> 22836.70s]  way that my stream gets banned this throwing up in vr it would ruin this whole fucking room

[23138.76s -> 23146.18s]  out my hair um mr oh me double j thanks for the five dollars me double j drummer would you say
[23146.18s -> 23151.62s]  that vr was worth it also so far what's your favorite vr game super hot vr is not only my
[23151.62s -> 23155.70s]  favorite vr game it's one of my favorite games i think i've played over the last couple of years
[23156.66s -> 23162.90s]  now here's the thing about vr that's a little strange and i get it this seems like there are
[23165.35s -> 23171.91s]  it seems like all these vr games are kind of like two to three hour experiences and they're all
[23172.71s -> 23181.29s]  between 15 and 25 dollars if super hot vr was a 60 dollar game and was like another three or four
[23181.29s -> 23185.29s]  maybe five hours of content maybe like another three hours of content even even if it was a
[23186.17s -> 23194.10s]  four to five hour vr experience i think i would be worth it but nobody's like making full on
[23194.10s -> 23201.86s]  complete vr games because probably that market share just isn't there and maybe people can only
[23201.86s -> 23209.11s]  play them for so long right but man if i if i could pay 60 bucks for two and a half times
[23209.11s -> 23212.87s]  the content that was in super hot vr that'd be one of my probably favorite games ever made
[23213.67s -> 23219.03s]  i'm not kidding around that's not a joke you know like ocarina of time no no no bump it off the
[23219.03s -> 23224.89s]  list see you later you add like two to three more hours of of actual campaign content in
[23224.89s -> 23233.56s]  super hot vr make it like a 40 to 50 60 dollar game that's one of my favorite games ever made
[23233.56s -> 23238.52s]  market share is a big word for you they used to trade cryptocurrency you don't think i know what
[23238.52s -> 23257.42s]  that word means he finally admitted it what are you guys know that i have an emote that is a coin
[23259.45s -> 23265.93s]  that was that why is it some now quit talking about cryptocurrency somebody just said it
[23265.93s -> 23269.69s]  but the thing is before i wasn't okay we're gonna move on because i wasn't talking about
[23269.69s -> 23274.17s]  it before and somebody accused me of talking about it before i don't talk about it anymore
[23274.17s -> 23279.56s]  it's a goddamn bear market and i'm not going to talk about that in a bear market
[23280.36s -> 23287.70s]  oh he knows what that word is that means that instead of uh it's a it's bull and bear
[23288.71s -> 23294.73s]  now how that works is in wall street instead of humans there are bears in suits that go in there
[23295.37s -> 23298.65s]  they're all dressed up and they trade for a little while that's like a bear market they're
[23298.65s -> 23303.13s]  allowed to be in there for a few months and then they let the the bears out when they're done
[23303.13s -> 23306.97s]  because they have to hibernate and the bulls come in and then they put on suits and shit and it's
[23306.97s -> 23322.22s]  animals no bull is up bear is down you don't think i know this stuff you want to know what
[23322.22s -> 23336.15s]  market cap means i'll give you a whole course stay after the credits that sounds like a furry party
[23336.15s -> 23348.70s]  okay i'm gonna laugh my ass off okay okay if i said that i was gonna do a financial course after
[23348.70s -> 23354.84s]  the credits and i was gonna explain market cap after the credits were over i wonder how many
[23354.84s -> 23363.58s]  people leave i'm not a financial advisor why did i say that never said that but yes uh back to i
[23363.58s -> 23373.19s]  don't know how that even got there but vr is great it's definitely worth it super hot vr was
[23374.07s -> 23382.41s]  unbelievably good to a point where i'm angry about it i am upset that super hot vr is something
[23382.41s -> 23386.25s]  that i can't play anymore because i mean i could go back and like beat all the levels and try to
[23386.25s -> 23392.81s]  get really good at them do the speed run stuff but i beat it in about an hour and 32 minutes
[23393.45s -> 23398.36s]  and it was one of my favorite things i've done in the last couple years take that how you will

[23617.21s -> 23621.77s]  never heard that i've never seen that sequence of letters before in a row i don't know is it a
[23621.77s -> 23637.08s]  different language i'm not sure whatever that means hey toshiro.tv thanks for the five dollars
[23638.28s -> 23642.04s]  jet island looks absolutely bonkers to play i hope to eventually get a vr set up
[23642.84s -> 23646.92s]  on an unrelated note i was wondering what your policy is on fan meetups i'm actually going to
[23646.92s -> 23652.52s]  be in vegas this weekend with my dad my 21st birthday happy 21st birthday i was hoping to
[23652.52s -> 23655.72s]  meet up at some point but since you're streaming all weekend that i won't worry about it much
[23656.28s -> 23660.12s]  hope i have as much fun in vegas as you do in vr well i can tell you right now
[23660.92s -> 23668.84s]  i don't do them i don't do fan meetups i don't do meet and greets unless very specifically
[23669.40s -> 23679.16s]  they are on a convention floor like a twitchcon a pax east pax west e3 i don't do meetups
[23681.11s -> 23683.51s]  i mean i guess this is like probably a handful of reasons why
[23684.31s -> 23702.71s]  terma just let us in your house he can't get the pass to conventions what but no i don't
[23702.71s -> 23712.28s]  i like to kind of here here's let me give you the long and short of it here so let's say that you
[23712.28s -> 23717.32s]  and i hung out tomorrow right all right i'm coming down i'll see you in a minute let's hang out and
[23717.32s -> 23723.21s]  let's let's play roulette you know whatever you would be doing let's go to dinner essentially
[23723.21s -> 23731.85s]  what i'm doing is i'm like i'm opening myself up to a stranger you know what i mean it's not
[23731.85s -> 23737.13s]  like i don't not like you're a stranger stranger you've been on the stream you write text i see
[23737.13s -> 23744.71s]  you in chat but i don't personally like to kind of open myself up to somebody that i don't know in
[23744.71s -> 23749.53s]  real life unless it was at a place that i was comfortable going to like a convention where
[23749.53s -> 23758.89s]  we're all there for the same reason anyways and that's nothing against anybody that ever wants

[25937.30s -> 25942.02s]  order whatever you want on the menu all the brand names are blocked out you don't know what anything
[25942.02s -> 25947.80s]  is you just know that you are in a restaurant okay so you order the fish and chips because
[25947.80s -> 25953.78s]  it's guaranteed to be on here you eat the fish and chips hey that was like a six to seven out
[25953.78s -> 25960.10s]  of ten i guess where are we oh well why don't you step outside and well i'll show you so okay

[25980.30s -> 25986.28s]  in front of the sign out front and it's actually a chili's because they're the same restaurant and
[25986.28s -> 25991.00s]  i could have just said that chilies and tgi fridays are the same restaurant there's no
[25991.00s -> 26002.70s]  differences you eat blindfolded out of chilies and eat blindfolded at tgi fridays the even the way
[26002.70s -> 26011.62s]  that people talk to you is the same what a walk that story was yeah first of all i could yeah i
[26011.62s -> 26014.42s]  blindfold you and then you come on in and i sit you know in a restaurant you get the fish and chips
[26014.42s -> 26023.91s]  that none of that matters i just gave you like five anime filler episodes for one punch in a
[26023.91s -> 26036.17s]  fight scene not even the whole thing i don't ask me what i why i did that but anyways uh thank you

[26047.45s -> 26051.21s]  to the end here thank you tingy for the two dollars and 51 cents i found a penny from my last message
[26051.77s -> 26057.05s]  it took me a while because canada doesn't use pennies anymore so i had to search for one found
[26057.05s -> 26062.65s]  it in some snow after my dog sled went over it and fell to bump while on my way to tim hortons for
[26062.65s -> 26076.04s]  a double double is that canada doesn't have pennies anymore they took him out of circulation
[26081.93s -> 26087.14s]  yeah okay so you eat it chilies you see you go down you have the fish and chips you're like oh
[26087.14s -> 26091.54s]  this is like this fish and chips just you're like crunching it tastes weird this is like really kind
[26091.54s -> 26097.46s]  of gross it tastes really off to me and you take a sip and you're like oh that's also off what the
[26097.46s -> 26102.02s]  fuck is going on this is disgusting and i take you outside the blindfold still on you i spin you
[26102.02s -> 26106.34s]  around i take the blindfold off it says tga fridays or chilies you're like oh tga fridays
[26106.34s -> 26116.23s]  i dropped the fucking veil it's pbr you've been eating and drinking pbr that's why you said that
[26116.23s -> 26122.62s]  hey commando thanks for the four dollars commando nam i got in a heated argument with my friend
[26122.62s -> 26129.06s]  today about what's better halo 2 or call of duty 2 i choose halo 2 and he chose call of duty 2
[26129.06s -> 26141.18s]  the worst call of duty world war 2 game of all time um i mean you kind of have to go with halo
[26141.18s -> 26153.99s]  2 halo 2 did a lot to define multiplayer shooters it was you know linking up with your friends and
[26153.99s -> 26164.60s]  playing it was halo 2 was like the golden eye of that generation of continuing the fps genre
[26164.60s -> 26168.38s]  that makes sense right then you're not going to pull my like my my skin off my face and it's
[26168.38s -> 26184.52s]  like a pbr under there that's a good point but yeah i'd say call i mean call of duty is
[26185.32s -> 26190.66s]  there's just too many of them it's the same thing like i don't understand like
[26190.66s -> 26196.82s]  battlefield five came out and what the heck it's not doing it's not selling as well as we wanted
[26196.82s -> 26204.58s]  it to just stop making those make a different video game i don't understand so you got battlefield
[26204.58s -> 26215.74s]  four battlefield one battlefield five what's next battlefield six i just do a different do something
[26215.90s -> 26222.94s]  else but i have an idea let's do battlefield again but star wars just give dice has one of
[26222.94s -> 26230.73s]  the best fucking engines in the entire country i'm talking all countries that frostbite engine is
[26230.73s -> 26239.74s]  insane get you do a different ip do something else but this time we're gonna put planes in it
[26239.74s -> 26245.32s]  i don't get that it was really great fucking battlefield was amazing some of those new
[26245.32s -> 26250.79s]  generation battlefields were were so like a real battlefield moment i know what you're talking
[26250.79s -> 26261.66s]  about but you don't think it's time to like hang up the battlefield coat and get a new coat you
[26261.66s -> 26271.86s]  don't even have to throw it away you can put it in the attic i would love it i would love dice
[26272.66s -> 26285.72s]  to do something else i don't know and this is just my this is my just fucking bread opinion
[26286.28s -> 26294.73s]  but i feel the same way about call of duty too activision hired three different studios to pump
[26294.73s -> 26299.77s]  them out over and over again it's like why don't you just like combine those three studios collective
[26299.77s -> 26305.56s]  intelligence quotients and the three of you come up with a fucking new great experience have it
[26305.56s -> 26314.23s]  pass around the office does cod still is that still a sell point does cod still sell that much
[26314.95s -> 26321.72s]  that you still have the three teams on it does it i don't think i feel like it doesn't it does
[26322.36s -> 26337.90s]  but yeah i mean i would love to see the creative people that are behind some of these games
[26338.62s -> 26350.34s]  just do something else call it is almost a guaranteed casual shooter pick up
[26350.34s -> 26361.32s]  yeah blops four he's been crazy popular maybe i'm just old and fucking out of touch but i
[26361.32s -> 26365.08s]  remember well i was about to just grab the mic and scream banjo kazooie into the mic
[26365.72s -> 26369.72s]  i was gonna go banjo kazooie when that came out i was gonna scream it good thing i didn't
[26369.72s -> 26383.70s]  a lot of talented people in this industry i feel like just making the next jason movie is not
[26383.70s -> 26389.11s]  another way to use the resources there but that's just me you know and i can't put the frog though
[26390.07s -> 26408.94s]  you know that one uh almost at the end germ is still waiting for half-life three
[26410.01s -> 26421.40s]  yeah it'd be nice it'd be cool they pop them up because battlefield and cod makes money and
[26421.40s -> 26440.38s]  they're safe yeah i guess turn up the music sonny oh is it low it's not even on you're right money
[26440.38s -> 26450.63s]  talks well let's hope that phil spencer after buying like 38 studios maybe they'll make
[26450.63s -> 26465.90s]  something together all right where the hell were we just what do they make my own game company
[26466.54s -> 26474.66s]  the first thing i'm gonna make is gonna be an ant simulator massive multiplayer you get one life
[26474.66s -> 26482.26s]  as a bug you could you could spawn as an ant right everybody's an ant just like a 500 000 people
[26482.26s -> 26487.22s]  servers you could do it because the amount of data required for an ant that doesn't do anything
[26487.22s -> 26492.94s]  besides eat and walk in your hands can work you could have a million people in that server
[26493.50s -> 26500.25s]  and you all have to work towards getting the queen more babies and then you can colonize and
[26500.25s -> 26514.65s]  like fight each other you could do it you can level up become like a worker ant and then a
[26514.65s -> 26519.53s]  flying ant you could even go as far as you could have like different skill trees like red ant
[26520.25s -> 26526.95s]  when you bite somebody it's one point of fire damage per tick for 10 seconds i do consulting
[26526.95s -> 26533.62s]  work just give me just give me money and i'll do it just one of these game companies hit me up
[26533.62s -> 26539.67s]  i'll take a 15 million dollar check one damage one damage per fire of tick that's worth a lot
[26545.10s -> 26549.26s]  i'm getting i'm like i'm i'm in one of those moods i don't know why it popped up after being
[26549.26s -> 26556.42s]  out of vr i think it's because i'm like allowed to breathe now when you become a hundred you get
[26556.42s -> 26570.54s]  you a queen yeah i can't wait to floss as an ant all right let's just let's do the bit somebody
[26570.54s -> 26574.06s]  said something about a penny and then we ended up there no no no it was uh call of duty 2 versus
[26574.06s -> 26580.82s]  halo i'd say halo too but that's just me thank you nate for the three dollars hey what about
