[1.02s -> 36.87s]  Hey, today, continuing from yesterday, we are going to play the part three, or is it part four?
[37.67s -> 46.62s]  I don't even know. Of the FMVs. This is like part five. We've done a lot of them. We may see the end
[47.74s -> 55.98s]  of the FMVs tonight. It's possible. Depends on if this first one is the only real, substantial
[56.94s -> 65.06s]  FMV video game that I have left. There aren't any more after this that are substantial.
[65.62s -> 76.25s]  I still have a couple of other fucking stupid ones, but, you know. And coming up next is the
[76.25s -> 89.03s]  carnival. No, that's next week. What would you do if I just turned off the intro? Then there was a
[89.03s -> 95.66s]  carnival behind me. I pulled it forward a week. I feel like people would be very upset about that.
[96.62s -> 105.66s]  Jerma, what the hell are you doing? I took off work on the 21st to watch this.
[106.30s -> 117.46s]  Oh shit, sorry. But no, the first thing I'm going to do is called Fox Hunt. This is a game made,
[117.46s -> 130.70s]  I think, by Capcom. I think this was on the PS1 as well. Maybe. I'm not 100% sure.
[133.78s -> 141.37s]  But, I got it ready. It's just open. Do you guys want to go? Do you want to see it?
[142.17s -> 160.42s]  You want to see this one? No? All right. Okay, we don't have to. All right. We can sit here.
[166.70s -> 173.74s]  All right. Do you want me to turn the stream off? Do you want me to just go? Should I go?
[174.46s -> 188.50s]  Do you want me? Should I leave? All right. Fox Hunt. There it is. I don't know what to expect,
[188.50s -> 195.14s]  although how can you expect anything with these games? They're all a fucking mess. It is a Capcom
[195.14s -> 200.70s]  game. There's the logo. The original Capcom logo. That's how you know it's going to be good.
[200.70s -> 230.74s]  Here we go. Let's get a good countdown here. One. What? How does every James Bond movie and
[230.74s -> 247.40s]  every wannabe James Bond movie have a skiing scene? What?
[247.40s -> 262.47s]  What? Is anybody getting any of this? Why are these guys' hands all burnt?
[283.69s -> 286.17s]  I know they're speaking English, but I can't understand them.
[294.46s -> 298.46s]  Now we are cooking with gas. Oh, now we're cooking with gas.
[300.38s -> 308.68s]  Grace falls for a schoolteacher, but got amnesia. The teacher that has amnesia?
[308.68s -> 312.68s]  Can't remember she used to be a stripper. What the fuck is this?
[320.30s -> 324.70s]  What? Why does this guy have Mickey Mouse gloves on? I don't understand why he's wearing those.
[324.78s -> 331.13s]  I don't understand why he's wearing those.
[341.30s -> 359.06s]  Briefcase switch. These are agents and there's the CD.
[361.93s -> 364.41s]  This is not exactly less stock for our board codes.
[365.21s -> 372.09s]  Oh, the shit. What the fuck is happening? 1972 height of Cold War. KGB set me up as big time
[372.09s -> 377.53s]  Hollywood producer to create a television show so bad, moral backbone of the United States would
[377.53s -> 384.52s]  break. Movid shows and soon Russians crave the same garbage and Kremlin blame it me for destroying
[384.52s -> 391.16s]  communism. Now I demand screen credit for all my shows or else hidden Soviet nuclear missiles set
[391.16s -> 398.20s]  to launch in 36 hours will cancel Los Angeles in mid-season. And to prove I am now loyal capitalist,
[398.20s -> 406.12s]  you will also pay 100 million dollars cash for disc fit launch abort codes. Idiot. Moron.
[407.08s -> 410.52s]  Who is he talking to? Don't kill him. He still has disc.
[414.04s -> 426.02s]  What? I had no idea. That's not me. This is me. Was that a TV show thing?
[426.82s -> 440.54s]  I might have just been making that up in my head. All right, reading a book. That's not a book.
[449.50s -> 453.10s]  Fighting must ward off attacks from vicious frontier morons.
[473.69s -> 487.66s]  The pacing here is kind of just way off. So there's a Russian agent who's going to
[488.92s -> 492.28s]  want 100 million dollars. Oh, we have the access. Wait.
[502.23s -> 512.31s]  Okay, I like the control. Controlling is fun. Computer. That's it. I just press W.
[514.97s -> 523.75s]  No, it's S. Okay. S is I don't know how to turn the computer on. How about the lamp? Oh, the phone.
[535.75s -> 540.07s]  I want my stuff back. Hey, Biffy Wiffy, turn off that video camera.
[546.36s -> 553.14s]  Is that supposed to be a is that like a friend? Is that. Hey, Jack, freeloader,
[553.14s -> 558.14s]  Fremont, I know you're there. I can hear you whimpering. Pay up, Mr. Fremont.
[558.14s -> 562.70s]  Borrow it from your folks if you have to because I'm going to be your touch if your phone is still
[562.70s -> 573.93s]  connected. Jack, darling, which is nicer, your baby brother's new Mercedes or your sister's new
[573.93s -> 580.41s]  Lexus? Anyway, I hope all is well. I love to call your mother. You know, if they paid for watching
[580.41s -> 594.47s]  reruns, our eldest son would be a millionaire. Hang up. Okay. Sure. We had the skiing thing in
[594.47s -> 605.45s]  the beginning. How do we leave the house? TV? No, I want to. What do I have a backpack on?
[605.45s -> 623.14s]  How do they get the backpack? So open the fridge and eat from the fridge.
[626.04s -> 642.14s]  Am I doing this wrong? Do I have to touch the latch or? All right. What do you do? Oh, easy.
[643.74s -> 683.37s]  It is. Okay. Rob Lowe is apparently in this game. Paid bill may already be a winner.
[684.81s -> 706.62s]  Open it. Collection agency. Tax returns 1988. What? I have no idea what the fuck he's talking about.
[706.62s -> 727.91s]  Go out the window? What about the pans? No, look over here. Tacos? Is it Christmas?
[727.99s -> 741.98s]  Chocotero tacos. So good. It'll save your life. Jesus. I hate this.
[751.83s -> 773.21s]  This is just like inside the apartment of like a creepy person. Just like a weirdo every day on
[773.21s -> 790.54s]  UBC. I can't read this. This is a Sim's house. It is. Even the way he's spinning his keyboard
[790.54s -> 809.90s]  turning. How do I leave the house? Get me out of the fucking house. No, I'm not looking at
[809.90s -> 822.49s]  it anymore like boobs. All right. Don't forget your keys. Don't, what does it say? Let me break
[822.49s -> 845.42s]  it in the house. Why am I not paying attention to this guy? Why are they acting like this?
[852.47s -> 854.55s]  This is just the principal from Billy Madison.
[869.38s -> 920.06s]  Did you just kill me? I'm pressing one, two, and three. Don't do it! What happened?
[928.22s -> 934.78s]  I can't, I have no idea what's going on. A guy broke into my house wearing a Donatello from
[934.78s -> 940.38s]  the Ninja Turtles thing on his hair. Look at his eyes. I made fun of him and then we had like a weird
[940.38s -> 947.35s]  play fight and then he jumped out of my fourth story window. That's it. I don't have anything
[947.35s -> 956.52s]  else to add to that. Live! 15 frames a second. It's time for Destiny TV's online game show
[956.52s -> 964.36s]  extravaganza. Here's our first question for our players. What do you say, King? It's Destiny time.
[964.36s -> 972.50s]  What the fuck? Is this an internet cafe?
[995.35s -> 1002.87s]  Am I the only one playing this game?
[1009.03s -> 1012.87s]  What? I walked into a bar and I'm the only person playing the fucking game.
[1025.59s -> 1053.37s]  I just got syringed. This goes up a full letter grade. This goes up two full letter grades. I got
[1053.37s -> 1060.58s]  syringed in the neck. This was an F. It's not like a C minus.
[1070.34s -> 1074.82s]  It's still an F. Not yet. That just went up two full letter grades. You guys don't understand.
[1074.82s -> 1082.38s]  A car is one. A syringe in the neck is two. All right, so I just got syringed.
[1083.50s -> 1084.86s]  I woke up. Let's see what's in this box.
[1094.23s -> 1100.07s]  He said that? Yeah, you know, put your right toe in, put your right toe out. You know that one.
[1104.87s -> 1114.17s]  This is so unsettling. It is. It is unsettling, but I'm intrigued. Is that the Joker?
[1119.42s -> 1126.52s]  Wheatley, get a load of me. These are like, it's like Truman Show type stuff where he's making TV
[1126.52s -> 1139.40s]  references every now and again. Open it. All right, how do I? Here comes the fake stomach
[1139.40s -> 1157.54s]  egg. Let's do it. Wait, hold on. Boxes? Can I open them? Is it going in here? Flowers? Is it food?
[1158.74s -> 1171.74s]  Cigars? That was pretty, that was pretty good. What? What else is in here?
[1176.20s -> 1180.28s]  The classic, the classic. I don't know what this is. I'm going to sneeze into it. I hope I don't
[1180.28s -> 1208.68s]  get in any trouble anymore. What about their computer? Can I turn on their computer? Yeah.
[1213.46s -> 1227.82s]  No, this game was made by a fucking alien. No, back, back up. I don't want to try to turn the
[1227.82s -> 1240.65s]  computer on again. I'm hungry. He just starts smashing it. What else on the table? Not that
[1240.65s -> 1246.73s]  I can see it. I have to do that. I go back to the top secret. There it is. How the hell would I
[1246.73s -> 1273.43s]  ever have found that? What? What? Give me the top secret thing. I just want to, it says top
[1273.43s -> 1280.39s]  secret. Just give it to me. It's right here. Stop knocking stuff over and making like Jim Carrey
[1280.39s -> 1295.53s]  faces and noises and shit and pick up the top secret data. Spies must wash hands before returning
[1295.53s -> 1300.01s]  to work. Personal hygiene is no big secret. All right. That's like fine. Right? You know what I
[1300.01s -> 1313.88s]  mean? There's more. They've more stuff in the CAA credit card. Okay. I stole the credit card out
[1313.88s -> 1321.19s]  of here. Do I have an inventory? I don't think I even have an inventory. There's more. This guy
[1321.19s -> 1329.34s]  has more shit in his pocket. Is that a sandwich? Why does this guy have so much stuff in his
[1329.34s -> 1351.78s]  pockets? You got more stuff in here? Okay. So now we go back to the door. It's a spy weapon. Yeah.
[1351.78s -> 1372.79s]  But what about where's my inventory? Nuclear missiles, do's and don't. Nuclear missiles,
[1372.79s -> 1385.19s]  do's and don't. Well, at least they have a manual. Did I miss something else over here? No.
[1388.07s -> 1393.67s]  We can just call Washington and tell the director he's a spy weapon. This maniac also has new
[1393.67s -> 1398.31s]  ward codes to stop Los Angeles from becoming the world's largest barbecue pit. He wants his payback
[1398.31s -> 1401.91s]  from his shows of the 70s and now you want me to tell Langley that he's bluffing?
[1403.99s -> 1410.79s]  Hello, Jack. I'm the dealer. I am the croupier. And I'm not supposed to talk to strangers. We
[1410.79s -> 1418.23s]  apologize for the circumstance, Jack. We're CIA. After the end of the Cold War, we've had cutbacks.
[1419.67s -> 1425.67s]  Serious cutbacks, Jack. We need you to deliver a briefcase in exchange for a package. Now,
[1425.67s -> 1433.03s]  if you do this, we will deposit $100,000 in your bank account. It's not that much.
[1433.03s -> 1439.67s]  Our development will be your contacts. Well, you know, um. That's Dr. Reva levels of under.
[1439.67s -> 1443.99s]  I'm not a spy. We have reason to believe that the double agent has compromised our security
[1443.99s -> 1453.45s]  and our identities. We don't need a spy, just a guy. This is going to be dangerous.
[1458.17s -> 1463.45s]  It sounds great, really. I can't believe my luck. But if I wanted to be filled with lead,
[1463.45s -> 1468.25s]  I'd continue to eat the paint off my bedroom walls. We'll give you $500 in advance. Cool.
[1468.81s -> 1474.41s]  $500? $100,000? No, add a couple of zeros. 20 years ago, the Fox had a kid with one of
[1474.41s -> 1477.45s]  those hot TV starlets. A girl. I wonder if she's cute.
[1481.29s -> 1484.73s]  He's fucking terrifying. This guy's terrifying. Where's the Pessy?
[1484.73s -> 1493.46s]  Is this the president? Who's the president? Oh dear. There is your CD-ROM reader. You
[1493.46s -> 1498.57s]  probably won't need it. I already got one. Not like this one, oh boy. It'll play anything,
[1498.57s -> 1505.05s]  including coded government discs from any country on earth. Cool. And my vibe has been
[1505.05s -> 1510.25s]  looking for the wolf. Wow, here you go. It's a wolf. The coolest thing I could possibly
[1510.25s -> 1522.18s]  fucking hand you. A non-region-locked CD player. Wow. Unbelievable. No, don't-
[1522.18s -> 1538.94s]  Another cocktail? Wise guy, I'm not sure. Uh-oh, it just went up another two letter grades.
[1542.46s -> 1545.06s]  I swear I'll never drink again.
[1548.20s -> 1559.27s]  Okay, so now I still don't have an inventory though. I think I just have this shit.
[1562.26s -> 1579.61s]  What is the credit card? Ah, that Global Terminological Threats. Fox. Codenamed the Fox.
[1580.33s -> 1587.37s]  H-53. Ukraine. National origin. Uh, the king of disinformation. The real name. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1587.37s -> 1592.41s]  So the number one spy during the 70s and early 80s. Ryzenpol's particular former film director.
[1592.41s -> 1597.29s]  He was enlisted by the Soviet KGB to destroy America by polluting its communications network.
[1597.93s -> 1603.61s]  During the 70s, he secretly created over half of all American television stories. Storylines and
[1603.61s -> 1608.89s]  plots or episodes were sent anonymously to the networks where executives took credit and made
[1608.89s -> 1615.05s]  millions. The Fox was promoted to the rank of KGB Colonel and was eventually one of the only five
[1615.05s -> 1622.07s]  men granted access to the launch codes for Russia's nuclear arsenal. The Fox traveled to Los Angeles
[1622.15s -> 1628.79s]  for a period in the early 70s and hobnobbed with the entertainment elite. There were even rumors
[1628.79s -> 1636.28s]  of an affair with a young starlet and possibly a child. Interesting. Soviets planned an attempt to
[1636.28s -> 1640.92s]  mesmerize America by sinking the level of entertainment so low that national morals and
[1640.92s -> 1646.60s]  moral morale would also die. It was a terrible failure. The disinformation plan backfired and
[1646.60s -> 1653.48s]  eventually Russians desired the same subversive television. His work has been greatly credited
[1653.48s -> 1660.28s]  for destroying communism worldwide. Rated extremely dangerous. Rumors abound that the Fox has stolen
[1660.28s -> 1666.20s]  the launch codes for Russia's remaining nuclear missile. CIA contact made and broken codes may
[1666.20s -> 1669.72s]  now be available on the internet for some reason. I thought it said on the internet.
[1670.68s -> 1674.52s]  Codes may not be available on the internet on the international black market. Oh,
[1674.52s -> 1681.75s]  that is what that is. I'm sorry, it's hard to read because this is like in a small window on
[1681.75s -> 1687.19s]  my screen and I've blown it up on your screen because I'm trying I have to squint to see this.
[1691.29s -> 1703.96s]  Okay, enter access code. Wait, these are all hold away. This is a mouse button. Look at all
[1703.96s -> 1715.59s]  these fucking things. Look at this shit. Fast cars and the chameleon is a former surfer dude
[1715.59s -> 1720.71s]  turned spy for hire. Son of a former female KGB agent and a California surf boat.
[1721.59s -> 1733.18s]  Favorite drink whiskey. Remember that bingo extortionist code name bingo age 32 from Montreal
[1733.74s -> 1739.58s]  self employed flower arranger archery ice sculpting bingo magnum is an international gambler
[1739.58s -> 1744.94s]  and extortionist who has vowed to finally earn the big score. Her goal is to obtain cash precious
[1744.94s -> 1750.62s]  medals and negotiable securities young beautiful and deadly. Miss Magnum is a university educated
[1750.62s -> 1756.54s]  mathematician with a photographic memory trained in her native Canada at the Royal Canadian Mounted
[1756.54s -> 1761.74s]  Police Academy in Ottawa to disappear from her job as an analyst in the anti terrorist section
[1761.74s -> 1769.62s]  and hooked up with members of the Quebec separatist movement. Okay, extremely dangerous.
[1769.62s -> 1777.27s]  We are when we know bingo unknown unknown presumed to be American. This computer hacker
[1777.27s -> 1782.55s]  is the only person to ever break the code to level one classified CIA files. He's the screen
[1782.55s -> 1789.83s]  name marauding avenger extra cheese and l chubby and has perpetrated a number of annoying pranks
[1790.79s -> 1800.01s]  rated annoying. Is that the guy from the beginning the guy that broke into my house and jumped out
[1800.01s -> 1807.50s]  of the window? Company personnel stationed or on assignment throughout the world are judged to
[1807.50s -> 1812.06s]  security risk if private behavior dictates a possible intelligence breach evidence confirmed

[12988.26s -> 12992.02s]  shoot the bad guys ahead of you and avoid the gunfire from behind the trick is to maneuver the
[12992.02s -> 13022.54s]  guys from behind you to in front of you while spinning to avoid their gunfire spinning spin
[13023.18s -> 13035.93s]  spinning i this is going too fucking fast man why i can't even make a choice

[13190.30s -> 13197.58s]  those last four or five these you couldn't pay me money to tell you what the fuck's happening
[13197.58s -> 13208.31s]  right now shoot oh i didn't even press the spin button once i didn't press s one fucking time
[13209.11s -> 13237.43s]  this guy is still here why is he still here spin
[13247.14s -> 13284.14s]  he's dodging how are you dodging hello what the name is jack jack freemont did he say yak
[13307.08s -> 13315.80s]  how the fuck did that even make any sense oh i love this game but i hate this game at the same
[13315.80s -> 13338.25s]  time i think this is the end is it one more decision good work jack wait thank you i didn't
[13338.25s -> 13358.12s]  stop the the nuke 1966 spring harvest wait didn't you get shot well in another two minutes you won't

[13370.50s -> 13376.81s]  okay maybe just one if this ends with the nuclear bomb going off
[13377.77s -> 13388.62s]  and great i'm gonna go to los angeles at least we didn't lose the money good show bye
[13411.08s -> 13425.30s]  it actually happened they actually did one of the end this multiple ending
[13430.30s -> 13449.42s]  how do you get the good ending yeah that's it that was fucking ridiculous
[13450.38s -> 13463.48s]  okay that was fox hunt we beat the whole game it was an absolute journey and it was a mess
[13464.04s -> 13469.85s]  it was all over the place but you know i i enjoyed my time didn't beat the whole game well i got to
[13469.85s -> 13476.79s]  the end i got to one of the ending you have to complete the hospital wheelchair scene on your
[13476.79s -> 13488.87s]  first try dude that seriously almost killed me this game is outrageous fox hunt by capcom
[13489.59s -> 13496.15s]  weirdly enough i'm still trying to get over the fact that rob low was in the game
[13497.03s -> 13505.61s]  for less than five minutes he just in the game and a couple clones this but that must have been
[13505.61s -> 13510.01s]  a favor you know he must have known that the dp or something it must have been a personal friend
[13510.57s -> 13516.58s]  hey you want to be in this movie this movie game thing for like five minutes just cameo it for fun
[13516.58s -> 13543.99s]  yeah sure why not killer soundtrack there you go capcom capcom capcom you're gonna do new game plus
[13544.79s -> 13547.43s]  no i'm gonna use the bathroom come back i'm gonna play another one
[13549.45s -> 13553.77s]  and unfortunately this is really it's in out of the fryer and into the frying pan
[13555.37s -> 13560.81s]  because the next one is there's no i don't there's no relaxing fmv game that i have
[13561.94s -> 13580.92s]  from this point going forward we are going to do uh crime patrol two drug wars so there really is
[13580.92s -> 13591.35s]  no there's no slowing down here so let me uh bear back i'm just gonna get a water use the bathroom
[13591.35s -> 13597.54s]  and we'll keep going do i have the game that has rob schneider in it you're talking about a fork
[13597.54s -> 13604.66s]  in the tail i really really wanted it but i had to make a decision because a fork in the tail
[13605.86s -> 13613.67s]  seems ridiculous like this but it requires windows 95 so what i had to do it i would have had to
[13613.67s -> 13623.42s]  make a new virtual machine for windows 95 to only play that game so i decided to spend time
[13623.42s -> 13639.18s]  in the windows 3.1 emulator do it i mean i probably will it's easy well it's not that it's not it's
[13639.18s -> 13644.76s]  not that it's hard to do it just there was a shitload of games on the 3.1 and i said all right well
[13644.76s -> 13648.60s]  i might as well just focus on this because remember i had to there's a lot of fucking
[13648.60s -> 13658.84s]  bullshit that you have to do to get some of these to work and some of them they they don't work even
[13658.84s -> 13666.78s]  with uh virtual emulation so virtual machine stuff i tried to get there are a couple other
[13666.78s -> 13671.10s]  ones for 3.1 that i tried to get to work and they just aren't going to no matter what i do
[13673.19s -> 13680.12s]  like oh you don't have quicktime 1.0 installed i refuse to run but i have quicktime 2.0 installed
[13680.12s -> 13688.57s]  that doesn't matter sorry um so i need to go find a win a 3.1 quicktime 1.0 installation file
[13689.45s -> 13692.49s]  and then install it and then hope it works but i have to install it on the virtual machine
[13693.46s -> 13698.82s]  like i have to go to like a super super duper it's like it's weird and i've done that before
[13698.82s -> 13725.98s]  and then the whole vm breaks quicktime 2.0 doesn't exist yes it does this is quicktime
[13725.98s -> 13743.82s]  2.1 did somebody did somebody say quicktime 2.0 doesn't exist people what hold on i thought it
[13743.82s -> 13758.49s]  didn't exist i thought it didn't exist though i thought it didn't exist please hide this i feel
[13758.49s -> 13772.57s]  old i disagree what happens if you disagree does it turn off windows no that's 2.1.2 wait that's
[13772.57s -> 13784.39s]  2.1.2 yeah for a second i thought the camera was on and i'm so glad it wasn't that would have been
[13784.39s -> 13807.56s]  embarrassing all right i'll see you guys in a minute we'll do uh drug wars see in a second
[13807.56s -> 14108.38s]  oh shit his pc turned off i'll be right back relax okay we are no longer playing a fox hunt
[14109.90s -> 14118.49s]  so i'm going to change that this is crime patrol 2 let me make sure it's being captured correctly
[14118.49s -> 14142.01s]  it is hello same thing i got three difficulties although i'm probably gonna have to i'm probably
[14142.01s -> 14147.98s]  gonna have to resize this let me try something here hold on does it stay the same or is it all
[14147.98s -> 14165.61s]  fucked up i can't see yeah i gotta change it that looks okay right there maybe a little bit more

[19471.35s -> 19480.38s]  somebody at the store four into one high performance exhaust gas charge progressive
[19480.38s -> 19486.57s]  suspension five position rebound damping adjustment upgraded racing engine higher rev compatibility
[19487.21s -> 19493.46s]  polished and ported cycle heads i how much money do i have i have a hundred bucks i don't have

[19510.79s -> 19524.23s]  just got here i'm good i just got here grid position what does this mean long all right
[19524.23s -> 19541.43s]  what about i can't select the track qualifying let's go but i don't know why the other why the
[19541.43s -> 19576.01s]  car is on this road 162 miles per hour jesus helicopter can you get arrested why the planes
[19576.01s -> 19591.22s]  flying that low you can't get hit by a fucking plane right are there any other buttons
[19603.10s -> 19624.28s]  i'm almost an 11th gear maybe i shouldn't have done long did i qualify i was in lap two
[19624.28s -> 19661.93s]  right okay i've not stopped going 162 those are rpms not gears yeah see it goes
[19663.77s -> 19676.28s]  i'm in six right zero so what does it mean let me ask you something because you guys that like
[19676.28s -> 19683.70s]  cars what does it mean when your car so let's say you have you have an automatic right you're not
[19683.70s -> 19690.58s]  driving a manual and let's say that you're you know between one and like two rpm right on the
[19690.58s -> 19695.62s]  bar there uh let's say that you like you're going like 20 30 miles per hour and you start to go
[19695.62s -> 19701.38s]  down to like one to two rpm right why is it and they're telling me what was you got somebody
[19701.38s -> 19707.30s]  that knows about cars let me know what you think about this so why is it that sometimes when you
[19707.30s -> 19714.70s]  slow down if anybody's in here that knows anything about cars if you slow down between one and two
[19714.70s -> 19729.74s]  rpm why is it that the um the car sometimes will all right hold on it was the like binaural beats
[19729.74s -> 19734.39s]  in my ears were fucking up my whole brain i couldn't even talk to you guys um anyway so
[19734.39s -> 19741.11s]  when i go in between two and one rpm sometimes i can feel the car like pulling up and down
[19741.67s -> 19751.56s]  uh gears why is that doing that i can feel it it's like
[19753.56s -> 19762.39s]  it's like ah it's annoying it's downshifting but every the car i've ever driven
[19762.39s -> 19770.15s]  didn't have that problem i didn't i didn't feel the car downshifting i do now why
[19779.38s -> 19791.50s]  where am i it's probably fine it means it has wasps in the car your gears are sloppy
[19792.90s -> 19801.82s]  huh slipping transmission what do i do about that is that a heart is it an easy fix is that
[19801.82s -> 19813.02s]  just like a hey man i'm i think my transmission is slipping fix it it's not what do you mean
[19813.74s -> 19829.54s]  how what do you mean it's expensive how expensive it's a couple hundred to a few thousand
[19830.26s -> 19839.29s]  that's a huge ballpark but am i getting some i'm getting some uh some slip it's slipping
[19840.01s -> 19854.38s]  that's not good i can feel it it only happens between like 20 mile between like 15 and 20 miles
[19854.38s -> 19866.12s]  per hour doesn't happen any other time is there a punch no of course why am i the only one that
[19866.12s -> 19885.40s]  falls first to second gear is fucked they can't go anywhere that apparently didn't get a hit all
[19885.40s -> 19892.78s]  right i'm in third place this is not bad i have an opportunity here to pass and get in first place
[19892.78s -> 19901.61s]  and win how did they not get hit by that stuff what kind of car do i drive but that would probably
[19901.61s -> 19909.21s]  help uh i drive a honda civic so maybe that would help oh no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
[19909.21s -> 19943.59s]  i just told people my car was my first place yeah it's a it's a 2023 honda civic i got the
[19943.59s -> 19948.20s]  new one early don't you guys know that they make these things fucking five years in advance to make
[19948.20s -> 19953.72s]  sure they have a shitload of them so they can just keep oh it's it's 2000 it's 2019 here's the 2021
[19953.72s -> 19968.15s]  they make there's like fucking a thousand of these cars already made guys new cars are like new
[19968.15s -> 19976.07s]  madden they just do a little bit of an update they change the paint and they make it look
[19976.07s -> 19990.55s]  shaped differently and then they smash the thing into walls a bunch of times and say hey we got
[19990.55s -> 19999.91s]  this safe yes it fucking better be don't you know i mean in every car commercial we've got
[19999.91s -> 20007.99s]  five star safety rating okay if you didn't i wouldn't have the car what do you mean the car
[20007.99s -> 20013.83s]  is working fucking safe good i it should be absolutely what do you mean why is it a selling
[20013.83s -> 20023.48s]  point two star safety and nobody ever talks about how their car is a two star safety car
[20024.36s -> 20031.50s]  they don't exist every car company likes to tell that well let me tell you a ranked five star safety
[20031.58s -> 20037.90s]  from yabba dabba doo associates okay well no one has a three or two star rated car
[20047.38s -> 20052.34s]  what does a two star rated car mean is it like yelp if you go to a two star restaurant you're
[20052.34s -> 20056.82s]  gonna get like sick so if you drive a two star car does that mean that it's gonna like break
[20057.70s -> 20074.04s]  i mean i can understand four stars five stars but but two i don't think there's any car
[20075.00s -> 20084.58s]  manufacturer that has a two star safety rating if they do the car is probably like
[20085.54s -> 20099.08s]  600 bucks how am i gonna win i'm in first place yeah get the fuck out of the way toad
[20100.82s -> 20114.70s]  always causing problems back here just lapped you going like two miles per hour oh it's 30 laps
[20115.34s -> 20127.72s]  oh shit why would anybody have a 30 lap race you're gonna run in a gas before the race is over
[20127.72s -> 20157.05s]  i made it 30 laps no i made it 30 long i didn't know what that meant all right what about a one
[20157.05s -> 20163.34s]  star rated car does that exist wait hold on let me answer that is a one star safety rated car
[20164.14s -> 20185.67s]  like a go kart right do they rate those does like jd power rate go karts this game this game is
[20185.99s -> 20195.67s]  sucks i think i actually am gonna run out of gas what's the left meter is that meter on the left
[20195.67s -> 20233.37s]  gas this is a shitty road rash yeah this is a road rash without the rash just the road it is
[20233.37s -> 20238.87s]  a real road though they definitely drove around somewhere because that's a real place that's real
[20238.87s -> 20294.25s]  grass real road now just 24 more of these finally i saw somebody else crash oh wait i died oh that
[20294.57s -> 20317.02s]  stupid that was terrible i want to no i want to turn it off 30 oh my god no i want to turn this
[20317.02s -> 20339.27s]  shit up yeah let's get let's get the fuck out of here well that was cycle mania pretty good
[20339.27s -> 20344.74s]  pretty fun ragequit no i saw i pretty much saw everything there is to see in the whole game
[20351.48s -> 20375.30s]  all right here's the plan oh my gosh here there are a few more but don't act like you have a plan
[20375.30s -> 20387.90s]  i do have a plan the plan is i'm going to i'm gonna leave it up to you guys okay we've been
[20387.90s -> 20398.50s]  doing a lot of fmv like the last three or four streams in a row have been fmv games so i'm
[20398.50s -> 20410.33s]  streaming tomorrow tomorrow is the last stream that will be a video game stream before the carnival
[20410.33s -> 20419.40s]  so i'm gonna ask you this very simple question with a poll do you want me to do more full motion
[20419.40s -> 20432.33s]  video stuff tomorrow or do something else i'm gonna make the poll right now that's something
[20432.33s -> 20445.29s]  else is just not fmv could be anything but there are one two three four there are about four
[20445.93s -> 20452.86s]  give or take fmv games left that are gonna take a long time to play kind of like the first one we
[20452.86s -> 20471.74s]  did i'm okay with holding on to these for another time but let's put this in here this is a simple
[20471.74s -> 20499.69s]  yes or no question there you go interesting okay can you tell us what the fmvs are um sure they are
[20502.90s -> 20511.61s]  uh flash traffic it's another one of those oh no there's a there's a plot that you need to stop
[20511.61s -> 20522.14s]  kind of like the first game but just not the same there's critical path the hell cab and
[20522.14s -> 20538.70s]  dracula you never did the second dragon's lair yo yeah i beat it i beat all the uh anime that
[20538.70s -> 20550.84s]  i i that hurt my whole head but yeah i did so it looks like uh most people would like to see
[20550.84s -> 20557.32s]  something else we can change it up it's been a lot of fmv we've done like 10 12 of these
[20558.97s -> 20564.14s]  it's it's a it's an overstimulating thing all right we'll do something else tomorrow
[20568.74s -> 20576.97s]  i will find something else to play tomorrow and then of course no whoops sorry and then of
[20576.97s -> 20581.29s]  course on the 16th is going to be the activity book stream that stream is not going to be very
[20581.29s -> 20585.13s]  long that stream is only going to be probably a couple hours long however long it takes to do
[20585.13s -> 20590.97s]  the book because then i have to get ready and that whole week is going to be setting up with
[20591.77s -> 20600.50s]  all the location people and the where we're going and get in touch with who's making the robots and
[20600.50s -> 20606.42s]  getting them and it's going to be a whole ordeal so i want to make sure that that's completely
[20606.42s -> 20620.55s]  taken care of and it's going to take me about a week robots question mark i am going to pin a
[20620.55s -> 20629.43s]  tweet tonight it's just going to be there for the next week and a half saying the date and the time
[20629.43s -> 20643.66s]  september 21st at 12 p.m eastern and i'm going to make a command here as well what is left for
[20643.66s -> 20653.75s]  tonight well i kind of i don't know if i want to start these right now because they might take
[20653.75s -> 20661.16s]  longer than a few hours and it's been about six hours now we've had these fmv streams have been
[20661.16s -> 20668.17s]  besides the one that got cut off they've been like a clean six hours so that's good and then
[20668.17s -> 20682.23s]  obviously the bits and everything so ends up being like six and a half seven so i like that
[20682.23s -> 20692.74s]  we'll hold on to them how many robots do you have for the carnival um those are spoilers am i going
[20692.74s -> 20700.79s]  to keep it under wraps i mean not there well let's just put this way that there's more than one
[20700.79s -> 20710.89s]  there are more than two you have there's more than two okay there you go all right told you
[20710.89s -> 20722.76s]  how many i did no whoops but you know what yeah i think we'll call it here this is a good place
[20722.76s -> 20728.86s]  to stop the other ones i'm certain i know for a fact that these other ones are going to take more
[20728.86s -> 20741.37s]  than a few hours so tomorrow we're gonna do something else and i i also want to be completely
[20741.37s -> 20751.16s]  honest here that fox hunt burnt like literally all of the fuel in my tank that was some of the
[20751.16s -> 20757.21s]  funniest fucked up shit i think i've ever seen it again so the first three and a half to four
[20757.21s -> 20765.38s]  hours of this stream was like all gas has been removed from the tank but it was awesome so yeah
[20765.38s -> 20770.18s]  i'll um i'll see you guys tomorrow we'll play a game we'll hang out probably we'll be probably
[20770.18s -> 20776.82s]  going to be a chill stream the next couple streams we're going to dial back the insanity
[20776.82s -> 20789.29s]  we'll just hang out and do something but uh with that see you tomorrow we'll do the bits
[20790.01s -> 20810.63s]  uh scrolling back here play monster rancher 2 monster rancher 2 memories but thank you door cube
[20810.63s -> 20819.61s]  for the 250 vhs streams are always fun you know what it's funny you say that because some of the
[20819.61s -> 20827.66s]  there are a lot of fmv games that are on vhs tapes somehow there are d i was gonna do a whole
[20827.66s -> 20835.69s]  thing playing dvd games from special features discs that is gonna take a whole ordeal getting
[20835.69s -> 20843.32s]  that set up you know when you buy like uh the lion king new animated blu-ray and there's just
[20843.32s -> 20855.62s]  a dumb fucking game on that disc i was gonna get a shitload of them that have it we were just gonna
[20855.62s -> 20861.70s]  play dvd games so like you can potentially look look forward to that in a later date
[20864.68s -> 20872.39s]  but not right now and not for a while there's a garfield dvd game well i'll have to get it
[20873.11s -> 20876.95s]  but thanks door keep for the 250 well germa with the activity book in carnival stream coming up
[20877.67s -> 20883.59s]  i think you know what the next big project is an fmv game of your own if you would make an fmv game
[20883.59s -> 20887.35s]  how to play would it be a point and click like fox hunt or more like security camera like night
[20887.35s -> 20892.41s]  trap it's funny you say that because that's something that i've like always wanted to do
[20893.51s -> 20900.82s]  i've brought up making an fmv game but i'm talking years ago more than a couple of years ago
[20900.82s -> 20910.15s]  the problem with game development and especially high budgeted development stuff
[20911.19s -> 20920.10s]  is that would need to be done the right way completely that would be a lot of money a lot
[20920.10s -> 20925.62s]  of potential people involved i would really need to get the right people involved in that
[20926.26s -> 20938.52s]  because it costs lots of money just to hire people and be on a location somewhere
[20938.52s -> 20942.60s]  even location scouting guys something that is a lot of people don't understand about
[20943.32s -> 20945.72s]  making a video or making streams or anything like that is
[20946.92s -> 20954.65s]  finding a place that will let you do things like a studio space or like where i was doing the
[20954.65s -> 20959.37s]  green screen stuff or the warehouse space or something and finding those places they're very
[20959.37s -> 20972.31s]  very very fucking expensive thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars so just
[20972.31s -> 20979.67s]  filming it just like principal photography for whatever it would be as i mean you're talking
[20979.67s -> 20985.43s]  about having to hire actors and people to make costumes and where are you going to film this
[20985.43s -> 20992.07s]  stuff do you have the permits to film this stuff before even pressing record on the camera you
[20992.07s -> 21001.88s]  might be looking at 50 60 70 hundred thousand dollars worth of stuff now some people we were
[21001.88s -> 21008.20s]  talking to like an fmv game right if you grab a camera with a couple of your buddies and you make
[21008.20s -> 21022.14s]  a movie then you get permission to film on location somewhere that's different hire random people from
[21022.14s -> 21030.04s]  craigslist you still have to hire those people but what would the gameplay be i always i wanted to
[21030.04s -> 21036.52s]  make a western i think that old school western like mad dog mccree is just the pinnacle of
[21036.52s -> 21040.92s]  full motion video games and i would want to make it authentic too i wouldn't i don't want hd cameras
[21041.56s -> 21045.32s]  at all if i was ever going to do something like that i want like 16 millimeter film
[21046.12s -> 21064.14s]  this shit doesn't have to be 1080p in fact i don't want it to be and have branching paths and stuff
[21064.14s -> 21068.06s]  i i've given this way too much thought for something that's not ever going to happen
[21068.78s -> 21075.22s]  at least in the near or far future but everybody does this everybody everybody sits down
[21076.18s -> 21081.61s]  and just thinks of you know what would be a great video game i think you just spitball
[21086.92s -> 21094.68s]  we can pull off miracles there was a lot of money given and i missed a big 50 dollar donation i'm
[21094.68s -> 21103.74s]  certain of that but cats beanie thanks for the 50 bucks 50 dollars from cats beanie and i this is
[21103.74s -> 21108.07s]  exactly what i was talking about not sure if you saw my big bits at the start of the stream it's
[21108.07s -> 21117.53s]  cool if not i was wondering what inspired you to do the robot carnival uh i don't know i just
[21117.53s -> 21124.92s]  thought it would be fun the original idea was i was going to get a dunk tank and have chat control
[21124.92s -> 21129.80s]  the pitching machine and then it was okay how you do that i just thought that would be fun i just
[21129.80s -> 21138.34s]  thought that that's it that was the only motivation or inspiration behind it because i was imagining
[21139.14s -> 21145.08s]  everybody in the chat like fighting over the controls and me just talking shit sitting up
[21145.08s -> 21149.80s]  there and everyone like missing and you try and then trying to we're gonna dunk them you know we
[21149.80s -> 21153.24s]  gotta dunk this motherfucker and i'm just sitting there like with a cigar like you ain't gonna
[21153.24s -> 21165.91s]  fucking dunk me and then it evolved into a bunch of games and a bunch of stuff so i don't i don't
[21165.91s -> 21174.42s]  inspiration and motivation stuff for me really just stems from i i don't know it just i just if
[21174.42s -> 21177.62s]  i think something's funny or interesting and i think it's worth pursuing and i'll do it
[21178.26s -> 21191.02s]  is really it we're gonna dunk you good luck go for it i wish you all the luck in the world
[21191.66s -> 21197.54s]  because you're gonna be fighting with the person sitting next to you because they're gonna want to
[21197.54s -> 21201.78s]  go left they're gonna want to increase the speed they're somebody over there is gonna want to
[21201.78s -> 21209.72s]  reduce the speed good luck oh that person just like decided to turn it that way i have faith
[21218.22s -> 21227.82s]  you still gotta smoke a cigar we're gonna get you in 10 seconds i would be shocked
[21228.62s -> 21236.73s]  if you dunked me in 10 seconds there is almost no way that's possible unless that every single
[21236.73s -> 21271.74s]  person works together no fucking way let's practice okay let's practice you're spoiling
[21271.74s -> 21276.20s]  commands i don't even i don't know if these are the commands now we have to go over that
[21278.49s -> 21285.85s]  increase speed 5000 yeah twitch could beat pokemon i'll get dunked oh maybe i won't
[21286.41s -> 21295.37s]  well i'm not gonna make it easy for you just thinking face on that one guys you know get
[21295.37s -> 21300.09s]  your brain cap on thinking face i'm not gonna make it fucking easy for you thinking face
[21304.44s -> 21319.51s]  about phylactery lich gave 100 bucks they say fund it more money from phylactery more
[21319.51s -> 21325.30s]  hundreds and hundreds of dollars hundreds of them thank you phylactery thank you cats beanie
[21325.30s -> 21337.22s]  for the donation earlier too hope that answers your question thank you they also say will there
[21337.22s -> 21341.30s]  be a birthday stream after the carnival that's cats beanie as well so thank you for the 100 bucks
[21341.30s -> 21353.05s]  cats beanie birthday no i am gonna be i'm not gonna be around i'm gonna be out of commission
[21354.15s -> 21369.67s]  probably until the 24th of september 23rd or 24th and then i'm back and then by then you know it's
[21369.67s -> 21376.34s]  time i'm streaming i gotta stream i don't like i said i think i said this yesterday i don't want
[21376.34s -> 21383.22s]  a scenario where i stream one time in two weeks if i can help it i'd like to keep broadcasting
[21384.02s -> 21394.09s]  because then twitchcon is that next weekend a lot of shit going on but maybe i don't know
[21394.09s -> 21403.30s]  we'll see but thank you thank you demons v for the 250 do you find streaming to be fulfilling
[21403.30s -> 21407.78s]  besides the obvious financial benefit do you feel like you have a creative outlet in your work
[21407.78s -> 21414.63s]  stimulating yeah i mean that's the whole point of doing something like the carnival
[21416.12s -> 21425.98s]  is to make sure that i continue to stimulate myself i get bored really really easily and
[21425.98s -> 21434.23s]  when i get bored i start to not care about something so that hasn't happened yet on stream for
[21434.23s -> 21440.70s]  streaming i don't want to have it get there because once it becomes boring it gonna parrot
[21440.70s -> 21446.33s]  what i said yesterday once it becomes not interesting and boring to me is when i would
[21446.33s -> 21460.79s]  just hang my hat up and be like that was fun i don't see that happening anytime soon but when
[21460.79s -> 21466.31s]  it does and if it does then you know you have to start to you know you close the book and you open
[21466.31s -> 21484.97s]  up a new one so this is a good final stream this one right here i don't know i cannot predict the
[21484.97s -> 21495.42s]  future i don't have a crystal ball but streaming at the moment is completely fulfilling and it
[21495.42s -> 21508.31s]  continues to be and we'll see how it goes from here i think it'll be good that's just me being
[21508.31s -> 21521.30s]  real that's it uh thank you to uh liberal liter for the ten dollars ten bucks from uh liberal

[21663.11s -> 21671.83s]  how i imagine you would if you were a secret agent it's great have a good night that game was
[21671.83s -> 21677.27s]  just ridiculous that's the kind of i would want to make something that was just not supposed to be
[21677.27s -> 21683.90s]  taken seriously but was interesting enough that the game had interesting things to do
[21687.77s -> 21700.04s]  i don't want to make just like a straight up strict meme game where it where it just has
[21701.10s -> 21709.02s]  only like crazy funny things whoa crazy what oh he he shit his pants and you pooped his pants
[21709.02s -> 21715.35s]  no i don't want to do that it would be i would try to have some comedy aspects to it but i think
[21715.35s -> 21722.82s]  i would want to have it be an actual game but thank you for the 250 yeah i did like it i thought it
[21722.82s -> 21734.73s]  was really interesting hey wolfstar thanks for the four dollars this is the longest time i've
[21734.73s -> 21745.45s]  ever spent watching a stream um the longest time i ever was on a stream was simpsons hit and run
[21748.18s -> 21759.05s]  13 hours right but thanks for watching for that long it yeah that's thanks i hope you enjoyed it
[21762.82s -> 21766.58s]  thank you egg johnson for the 250 hey germa when are you going to give the people what they want
[21766.58s -> 21772.12s]  and do a chess stream i know how to play chess but i don't know how to play chess
[21772.92s -> 21791.06s]  i would never do that phylactery with the 69 subs let's show the subs thank you everybody
[21791.62s -> 21797.45s]  for gifting subs for subbing for resubbing for if you're brand new and you just subbed
[21797.45s -> 21802.95s]  if you've been here for years and you decided to sub if you don't sub at all that's fine too
[21803.51s -> 21812.31s]  thanks for being here you guys think i can handle chess after the checkers incidents
[21822.58s -> 21826.34s]  thank you bro luck for the five dollars i think this stream has proven you don't know much about
[21826.34s -> 21831.38s]  cars it's not one rpm it's a thousand rpm i know i'm just saying on the dash
[21832.50s -> 21838.02s]  rpm is revolutions per minute revolutions of the crankshaft every minute also most cars before
[21838.02s -> 21844.58s]  like 2005 have basic basically zero star rating because of all the new safety features in newer
[21844.58s -> 21849.46s]  cars like crumble zones better airbags crash avoidance systems and overall better engineering
[21849.46s -> 21864.65s]  get your transmission looked at but are there any one-star cars now is a lawnmower a like zero
[21864.65s -> 21879.58s]  safety rated car right is a one star safety rated vehicle of rideable lawnmower it's not a car
[21879.58s -> 21888.44s]  it's an automobile it's a traveling vehicle with an engine it's not road legal
[21895.75s -> 21901.67s]  it's not road legal imagine seeing some fucking dickhead on like the road with a
[21901.67s -> 21910.01s]  rideable mower this is out of red light you look at the window you're like hey man what the fuck
[21910.01s -> 21916.01s]  is wrong with you now don't worry about it the blades aren't down i'm not the blades aren't
[21916.01s -> 21930.74s]  active those things can fucking move but the blade's not done i've worked in the country
[21930.74s -> 21946.46s]  people did that that's so fucking dangerous all right hold on what about a forklift is a forklift
[21946.54s -> 21958.70s]  a five star safety rated vehicle it's its only existence is for safety it has to be a forklift
[21958.70s -> 21963.50s]  is a safety vehicle therefore it has to be a five star rated safety vehicle otherwise would you get
[21963.50s -> 21973.27s]  in one forklifts don't have doors or airbag but uh what if they did what do you mean a forklift
[21973.27s -> 21985.69s]  doesn't have an airbag imagine being in a forklift and just like bumping into the wall and a big air
[21985.69s -> 21998.73s]  bag hits you in the face the airbag would fucking like knock you out you're going like eight miles
[21998.73s -> 22016.36s]  per hour like you just face first in the airbag here's a zero star rated car from 2014 wait
[22017.16s -> 22030.10s]  what is this actually real crash test of the the ford fego what is a ford fego
[22031.30s -> 22050.22s]  ford what ford fego safety rating the ford fego facelift has received a three star safety rating
[22053.78s -> 22066.25s]  in the new one what about the 2014 one i ain't gonna eat at that restaurant are you guys like me
[22067.29s -> 22071.21s]  if it's not mcdonald's burger king or wendy's if it's less than three stars you don't go
[22073.82s -> 22087.94s]  right i feel like most people right let me know if it's not mcdonald's burger king wendy's
[22087.94s -> 22103.61s]  arby's any of the ease arby's wendy's burger king ease mcdonald's ease if it's less than three stars
[22103.61s -> 22111.40s]  i ain't gonna go nobody reviews mcdonald's if you leave a two star rating at a restaurant that's
[22111.40s -> 22118.68s]  not one of those fast food places there was a reason why i can't remember the last time that
[22118.68s -> 22123.80s]  somebody forgot half my fucking order at mcdonald's and i was like let me just go on your fucking
[22123.80s -> 22131.11s]  heel pretty give them one star i know you go oh mcdonald's like sucks whatever and you like
[22131.11s -> 22139.75s]  either go back and get it fixed or no you don't well you don't leave a review oh shit my burger
[22139.75s -> 22147.35s]  king uh my whopper it tastes like somebody and it looks like somebody sat on it it's missing all
[22147.35s -> 22156.06s]  the things i asked for it and then the bun is it looks like it has mold on it get on me open
[22156.06s -> 22160.71s]  no you just let go of that i'm throwing this in the trash this thing's gross and you move on
[22167.77s -> 22171.05s]  and also some people that here's another thing this is where this is where it gets like kind of
[22171.05s -> 22176.97s]  weird some people will review restaurants and and they give it a bad rating when maybe they
[22176.97s -> 22183.08s]  even shouldn't have you know sometimes it's just somebody's like i and you know the way i'll tell
[22183.08s -> 22191.96s]  you i was gonna i was gonna give this place four stars because the food was great end quote but
[22191.96s -> 22198.52s]  let me tell you something about the server katherine okay she came over to my table
[22199.86s -> 22209.11s]  and she didn't ask me if i wanted a water refill places a one star restaurant there was this the
[22209.11s -> 22215.11s]  sugar wasn't repacked on the table i mean my my burrito was absolutely delicious it was probably
[22215.11s -> 22219.98s]  one of the best burritos in the city but what if i wanted fucking coffee and i wanted to put sugar
[22219.98s -> 22233.56s]  in my coffee it wasn't on the table jeez what the fuck why is this person putting sugar in their
[22233.56s -> 22246.30s]  burrito you know i sat down at this table and i am not kidding i saw a smudge a big smudge on the
[22246.30s -> 22270.10s]  table somebody's thumbprint and it made me gag and me and my nine children left sometimes people
[22270.10s -> 22276.36s]  do big orders and i i gotta you gotta give some credit to the restaurants right sometimes
[22277.24s -> 22283.70s]  if you go in with like 10 people and you let's say you all order the exact same thing let's say you
[22283.70s -> 22291.98s]  all there's 10 of you you go into the restaurant you all order the chicken thighs you're all going
[22291.98s -> 22295.90s]  to get a slightly different food slightly just only slightly because like no two chickens are
[22295.90s -> 22300.20s]  the same one of them might have a little bit of fat on it one of them but they're still good you
[22300.20s -> 22308.04s]  know it might still be good you can't everyone can't have the exact same food no matter what
[22308.04s -> 22314.62s]  the chicken is a different it's a different chicken possibly what if that chicken was lazy
[22314.62s -> 22320.78s]  and didn't run around what if that chicken was a little tougher than the other one it's just basic
[22320.78s -> 22329.34s]  science guys it's just basic food science and then i take a bite out of my food and the same exact
[22329.34s -> 22332.78s]  order on the menu it's got the same sauce same everything it's a little tougher oh this is kind
[22332.78s -> 22337.74s]  of tough today and the person next to me is like this is fucking absolutely scrumptious let me try
[22337.74s -> 22345.53s]  yours yeah that is like good i think i give it a one star rating because like the chicken didn't
[22345.53s -> 22364.36s]  fucking run around in the coop it's just basic science people that leave yelp reviews on
[22364.36s -> 22371.13s]  mcdonald's you know i was thinking about i don't know just a random thought just go to like
[22371.13s -> 22377.00s]  mcdonald's just go and like go and uh that was a good that was it was just a regular decent
[22377.00s -> 22382.76s]  mcdonald's experience and write like an absolutely wonderful review like five stars like as if this
[22382.76s -> 22391.93s]  place is like 200 dollars a plate talk about the inside i walked in and oh i was wowed by the
[22391.93s -> 22403.90s]  architecture the beautiful the crimson red and the mustard yellow it was just the color combination
[22403.90s -> 22409.26s]  just matched so perfectly well and the chairs were very sturdy and do like a full five paragraph
[22410.06s -> 22421.70s]  about how amazing the place was the stunning design choice of the ketchup on the table yeah
[22421.70s -> 22438.94s]  just go fucking nuts how do we end up in this topic i don't know i have no i have no idea oh
[22438.94s -> 22446.63s]  talk about cars right like two stars for car yeah okay that's all don't say it was a mcdonald's
[22446.63s -> 22459.38s]  until the end of the review well it would have to be like on a mcdonald's page ah you know what
[22459.38s -> 22462.98s]  this is gonna be it might be i don't know it's possible that this might be an unpopular opinion
[22463.86s -> 22470.90s]  i don't think that there should be stars on yelp i think it should just be have to ride fucking
[22470.90s -> 22483.83s]  review that's just me i just like sip this there's nothing in it i did like the kermit the frog thing
[22483.83s -> 22489.11s]  like well you know sip the fucking tea sip the fucking tea well i'm why am i doing the bubble
[22489.11s -> 22503.69s]  so often i don't even watch that show thank you bro luck for the five dollars appreciate it
[22504.41s -> 22508.57s]  hey christin thanks for 30 bucks what about team fortress 2 what about team fortress 2
[22508.57s -> 22514.65s]  it's a great first person shooter with an awesome array of classes and lots of gameplay choices
[22515.53s -> 22519.32s]  one of the best first person shooters i may have ever played it's a great game
[22519.32s -> 22533.32s]  what about it it's good you should play it i i honestly you know i i may have drained i may
[22533.32s -> 22540.36s]  have like drained all the vampire type blood out of that game that i can you know i i've like sunk
[22540.36s -> 22550.07s]  my teeth into tf2 and i drained all the blood it's all gone for me step on it come on that
[22550.07s -> 22564.10s]  wasn't even very good df2 yelp no i have no intention of playing it again really it would
[22564.10s -> 22569.46s]  take something very very very significant for me to ever play that game again i still think it's
[22569.46s -> 22577.38s]  one of the best games ever made but you know i also think pizza is the best like food in the
[22577.46s -> 22583.22s]  world i like love pizza i love pepperoni pizza more than anything but i sometimes sometimes
[22583.22s -> 22586.74s]  you just don't want to eat pepperoni pizza you want to move on to like sushi or something and
[22586.74s -> 22599.80s]  it becomes your new favorite thing you can't eat pizza every day don't even give me that bagel bites
[22599.80s -> 22604.12s]  bullshit commercial about pizza in the morning pizza in the evening pizza at suppertime
[22605.06s -> 22617.54s]  pizzas on a bagel it could be pizza every time no don't do that pizza should not be eaten in the
[22617.54s -> 22630.58s]  morning in the afternoon and at the evening every day but thank you for the $30 30,000 bits
[22631.22s -> 22636.18s]  i have no intention of going back to team fortress i do love that game and i do like seeing it pop
[22636.18s -> 22640.10s]  up when it pops up from time to time you'll see it somewhere usually it'll there'll be like an
[22640.10s -> 22644.58s]  image or there'll be some artwork or there'll be um something like meme that uses the characters
[22644.58s -> 22654.33s]  you're like oh there they are it's a nice little reminder uh modus pons thanks for the 250 there's
[22654.33s -> 22660.73s]  a repair pal there's a possible oh this is for the car possible shift control solenoid fault
[22661.53s -> 22671.77s]  i'm gonna i'm gonna bookmark that thanks for the help that actually like maybe you just figured it
[22671.77s -> 22683.69s]  up pizza is more nutritious than cereal what cereal are you eating because i would have to
[22683.69s -> 22690.15s]  tell you that like like Kellogg's corn flakes i'm not sure is less healthy than a slice of
[22690.23s -> 22705.10s]  pepperoni pizza but what about total how do people put sugar on their cereal i don't like can we go
[22705.10s -> 22716.86s]  over that too why do people do that i've seen people have a bowl of cereal and they go in the
[22716.86s -> 22722.94s]  little sugar bowl and just one two three four and you spread it on the top and you move it around
[22723.82s -> 22734.63s]  what would you don't do that depends on the cereal no it's not supposed you're not supposed to put
[22734.63s -> 22741.19s]  a bunch of sugar on your total brand flakes that's you breaking the design philosophy
[22741.19s -> 22747.38s]  of the developer the dev didn't want you to go through that door and you broke it and you went
[22747.38s -> 22752.50s]  in anyways and you glitched through the wall and you saw all the items that are in the fucking game
[22752.50s -> 22765.56s]  in the dev room breaking and now you you got it you fucked it all up and you soil it for yourself
[22765.56s -> 22777.10s]  i don't even put sugar in my coffee anymore did you guys know that you're only supposed to have
[22777.66s -> 22783.10s]  35 or 38 grams of added sugar a day did you guys know that did you guys know this
[22788.52s -> 22796.92s]  if you drink one soda if you drink one coca-cola classic out of the can your entire day of added
[22796.92s -> 22807.64s]  sugar is over and then you are now over what the heck is going on here they're sweetening us to
[22807.64s -> 22828.87s]  death this is what they're doing i have this this powder it's like a little uh it's like a
[22828.87s -> 22834.84s]  flavored like vanilla powder right you can put it in your coffee you can add it to
[22834.84s -> 22841.67s]  pretty much whatever you want on the back of this thing it's oh here here's the the serving size
[22843.13s -> 22852.12s]  a third of a cup of this sugar powder is one serving a third of a cup of this
[22853.08s -> 22865.14s]  dusty vanilla sugar fucking bullshit is one serving shit's almost 40 grams of sugar why
[22865.14s -> 22872.25s]  why would you put that much in there are you okay calm i can't calm down we're talking about the
[22872.33s -> 22882.31s]  health of of talking about our health i'm talking about your health did you know
[22885.86s -> 22892.82s]  did you know that if you cut the amount of sugar in half that you put into your coffee
[22893.78s -> 22912.82s]  you wouldn't know the difference in a blind taste test did you know how can you cut zero and half
[22913.70s -> 22920.49s]  good good job i think if i'm i think it's the soda companies the soda companies just want
[22920.49s -> 22955.67s]  you to be all popped up on sugar you know that honestly it would be if i would drink two or three
[22955.67s -> 22962.62s]  from a day if it were me and i was up to me i would have like three four five sodas a day
[22962.62s -> 22969.94s]  every day in fact like before bed too that's something about that is just really very
[22969.94s -> 22978.57s]  interesting to me to do that and die wouldn't i don't go don't go to the dentist anymore either
