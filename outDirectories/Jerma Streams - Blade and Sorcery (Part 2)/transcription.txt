[1.66s -> 9.90s]  Alright, hello. We'll go for a little bit longer. We'll do some of the Blade and Sorcery update.
[9.90s -> 22.87s]  It should be opening now. You should see it on your screen in about five seconds.
[24.36s -> 46.44s]  One, two, three, four, five, six. Alright, Blade and Sorcery. I'm ready.
[50.41s -> 59.19s]  We probably will put the cap on. Maybe we'll go back another day on disassembly. It's so much fun.
[59.75s -> 62.79s]  It's just such a relaxing game. If you want a relaxing, just chill
[64.18s -> 71.11s]  and cry on the ground because a microwave won't open. It's fun. It's 30 bucks, so it's a little
[71.11s -> 77.35s]  one on the expensive side for a VR experience, but it's still good and there's a ton of content.
[78.79s -> 94.97s]  Why is everybody laughing? Did I brush my teeth? What? What are you guys talking about?
[94.97s -> 100.92s]  What the hell are you talking about? I can't even see. I gotta see what you guys are saying.
[106.78s -> 124.89s]  Back in the closet. Nope, no one's in there. You guys are fucking twisting me up. I have
[124.89s -> 154.06s]  to check every time now. Alright, so where are my hands? Well, there's one hand. Alright,
[154.06s -> 173.03s]  this is where I was before. Let's go. Next. Oh, whoops. Play. Calibrate. Blade and Sorcery.
[173.03s -> 185.05s]  It's been a while. I kind of forget how to play. We will continue. I believe it is right. Oh,
[185.05s -> 192.82s]  my god, that I'm running too fast. Oh, you have to move your hands, right? And then it's,
[194.58s -> 209.05s]  yep, it is the right trigger, the right grip. Already fucking shit up. Watch me take the tip
[209.05s -> 215.66s]  of the candle. Oh, it was a trash can. Either one. Alright, let's go. You can do two grip
[215.66s -> 223.61s]  at the same time. If I remember correctly, you can, right? Maybe not on this particular sword.
[223.61s -> 227.61s]  You got stuff in your pockets. You can dagger and then either holster over here.
[229.38s -> 240.22s]  So what we got? Canyon. Arena. Market. Unknown location. Work in progress.
[241.42s -> 263.61s]  Should we go check it out? What's new? Upstairs. Cool. So, god damn it.
[268.97s -> 277.08s]  It's getting worse, the amount of things I'm going to smash into. Honestly. Did my room get
[277.08s -> 297.78s]  smaller? I feel like the room got smaller. Take his arms. The room got smaller. It did.
[299.56s -> 309.14s]  Look at this. I'm already hitting shit. My room shrunk by like 45%. What's up there,
[309.14s -> 333.94s]  anything? Alright, let's test out, oops. I like the spears the most out of all the weapons.
[335.26s -> 345.80s]  These are my favorites because you can just go like this and just fucking charge. Right in the
[345.80s -> 353.19s]  face. Right in the face. Right in the face. Alright. How do you, what's the throw? Isn't
[353.19s -> 371.11s]  there a throw? Is it grip and then grip again? What is throw? Enable climbing?
[371.91s -> 385.37s]  They don't talk about the book so close to you. General climbing. Experimental. Player
[385.37s -> 410.97s]  invincibility. Physical climb. Physical climb. Alright, so what does that do? I can like use
[410.97s -> 430.33s]  your weapon to climb. Oh, this is really weird. Oh, there's a chest up here. What's in the
[430.33s -> 453.90s]  chest? There's nothing in here? Oh, okay. Alright, let's go fight. Alright, what's in
[453.90s -> 467.85s]  these areas new? This ruins arena. I feel like, is Canyon new? Let's go check it out.
[467.85s -> 475.50s]  Oh, wow. Alright, we're gonna do very easy because I'm gonna get back to playing.
[476.30s -> 492.23s]  One of the potions, right? This is cool looking though. I like this, like the stabby sword.
[492.87s -> 514.65s]  Okay, let's get the potions ready. At least one of them. Alright, here we go. This is
[514.65s -> 525.34s]  the snake technique. Let's just do wave one. Let's just do very easy. Let's just, because
[525.34s -> 535.66s]  I gotta remember how to play. Here we go. Always have to be moving around in snake
[535.66s -> 580.82s]  technique. What the hell happened? What? Why are they running away? Whoa! Already,
[580.82s -> 626.66s]  oh, that's brutal. Um, I already, I already lost my headphone. Come here. I'm trying
[626.66s -> 654.81s]  to cut her leg off. Get me. Oh, he got me. Get him in the face of the shop. You'll
[654.81s -> 689.27s]  be mine soon enough. We good? We did it. So you can cut people's arms and legs off.
[689.27s -> 708.22s]  Now I need to, I need to heal. Healing, please. Let's try, uh, something quick. Let's do two
[708.22s -> 739.38s]  of these. It's hard to get the grips. The grips are right here. I need to, I gotta
[739.38s -> 810.87s]  heal. Alright, let's do it again. Let's do wave three. Come here. Right in the neck.
[820.55s -> 867.54s]  Oh! There's a wall. What? Whoa! Whoa! Hey! I'm trapped in a dream.
[867.54s -> 945.14s]  I think I broke it. Just come over here. I, come on, get. Damn it. What? I have to,
[945.14s -> 991.86s]  what the hell? I can't pick anything up. Oh, now you gave me a sword and now you're in big trouble.
[1008.42s -> 1044.02s]  Get out of my fucking face. That's some good steam. That's some good steam. Climb with the
[1044.02s -> 1087.37s]  axe. Holy shit. Is this getting over it? I need another axe. Let's go check over here.
[1087.37s -> 1178.41s]  I wasn't prepared for that. Oh my god! Grabbed up! I just Super Mario'd a spear. Jesus Christ,
[1178.41s -> 1227.08s]  my hand is shaky right now. Oh shit. Not what was intended. Not the flourishing move that I
[1227.08s -> 1309.32s]  intended. I'm gonna put a fucking hole in my wall. VR is too dangerous. I swear.
[1342.86s -> 1358.81s]  Oh my god! I'm gonna throw it in my room. Get off my sword! Another one! Get off! Get off!
[1363.91s -> 1371.10s]  Oh, I just fucked up my hand. I just fucked up my hand, I think.
[1371.90s -> 1382.02s]  Yeah, I did. Seriously. Oh, there's some skin ripped off there.
[1382.02s -> 1498.76s]  There. It's brutal. Pogo stick with the spear. It's going through. Hold on. That's fun as hell.
[1498.76s -> 1505.11s]  That's fun as hell. All right, give me some healing. I'm gonna pogo stick for somebody's
[1505.11s -> 1543.56s]  head. I have to just goomba stomp somebody. So it's like up here. This is gonna be fucking
[1543.56s -> 1597.24s]  ridiculous. Here we go. Oh, it's close! I got hit. I got caught. You're ruining my fun.
[1600.81s -> 1621.37s]  Oh shit. Pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo, pogo. I gotta do that again. I feel
[1621.37s -> 1639.27s]  like I could get it. I'm gonna skewer somebody. Oh my god, my back. Okay, let's go.
[1639.27s -> 1684.92s]  But I need a lot of enemies. How do I track this down? There we go. Uh oh! Uh oh! Uh oh! Uh oh!
[1684.92s -> 1722.18s]  Uh oh! Uh oh! Yes! Oh shit. I got it. Use the axe on the zipline? Oh man,
[1722.18s -> 1780.70s]  that sounds like fun too. Axe on the zipline. All right, let's go for it. Um, haha! See you
[1780.78s -> 1850.55s]  in hell. One, two, three. What? We both did the same thing. We both did the same fucking move.
[1851.19s -> 1872.39s]  That was just Dark Souls PvP. I'm out of gas. I'm out of gas. I'm out of gas. I'm out of gas.
[1872.39s -> 1924.46s]  I'm out of gas. I'm out of gas. We got a raid came in. How's my hand? It's all right.
[1924.46s -> 1935.18s]  A little wounded, but it's fine. Kiwo. Hey, Kiwo. Kiwo coming in with a raid. Oh,
[1935.18s -> 1942.98s]  all right. Kiwo did come in with a raid. Hello, everybody. I'm currently in the uh at like 245
[1942.98s -> 1948.82s]  calories burned and I'm already done. Kind of winded right now. Uh, we're doing blade and
[1948.82s -> 1953.56s]  sorcery. Thank you so much, Kiwo. I hope you had a good stream and welcome everybody.
[1953.56s -> 1965.42s]  We're doing a pogo stick technique. I'm gonna try it again. Sorry, I'm a little sweaty.
[1965.42s -> 1970.44s]  That's what happens when you get in the virtual world. All right, let's try pogo one
[1970.44s -> 1977.34s]  more time with like 30 enemies. But again, welcome everybody. Thanks for the raid, Kiwo.
[1977.42s -> 2007.67s]  Fuck yeah. Thank you. Uh, I think I know what's wrong. All right, pogo stick time.
[2009.11s -> 2024.79s]  We're good. This is like the funnest thing I've ever done. I wonder how high can you actually
[2024.79s -> 2050.60s]  get? Oh shit. Okay, let's get back up there. Just run. Just run up there. You're too long.
[2064.17s -> 2075.00s]  There we go. Okay, I got my Garuva. Let's do it. It's just another heavy wave of monsters.
[2075.56s -> 2080.44s]  Here we go. This is hard. You can fall in a million different places.
[2080.44s -> 2104.78s]  I'm gonna go up. Can I get up there? This is a gap here. This is, this is tricky.
[2104.78s -> 2127.45s]  There you go. Oh dear. Oh dear. I'm good. Ducked. You duck. How did you duck that?
[2136.71s -> 2182.18s]  They're so good at dodging. Oh god. What happened? Oh, get it. Get it. Get it, guys.
[2182.18s -> 2252.50s]  Come on. Oh, you pulled me. Come here, you son of a bitch. I'm getting pretty good at this.
[2252.50s -> 2268.66s]  Stay down. Just like rowing a boat. Check this. Ready? We're gonna end this one with a
[2268.66s -> 2276.25s]  flourish. Not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet. Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[2276.25s -> 2318.22s]  He ducked. I just shot himself with an arrow. Oh god. Oh god, it's over. Oh, no.
[2328.73s -> 2394.94s]  Let go of this. What? Oh, fuck it. I got the double pogo. Oh, come on. What the hell?
[2415.74s -> 2458.04s]  What? How did I make two of you? How long is this fucking level? How many fucking enemies are
[2458.04s -> 2478.28s]  there? How many enemies are in the level? Did I beat it? I did it. That was hard.
[2478.28s -> 2490.68s]  That was on hard mode. Oh my goodness, I'm fucking exhausted. I actually fought
[2490.68s -> 2507.69s]  30 people in real life. And won. And I won. And I won. That was wave three, hard mode.
[2507.69s -> 2530.87s]  The local man goes crazy in VR. You're crazy. What the fuck? Why? What? It's a video game.
[2530.87s -> 2552.30s]  You're sick, man. I think it's time for me to wind down. Close the closet. Okay.
[2552.30s -> 2556.07s]  Drink some water. I'm made out of 75% water. I'll just drink myself.
[2556.71s -> 2567.70s]  I'll be fine. No, I'll be fine. Oh, yeah, I think I'm gonna have to call it there. I'm
[2567.70s -> 2579.99s]  fucking destroyed. What? The Dane Axe? Okay. He's gone. No, not this shit again.
[2589.43s -> 2595.54s]  What's the Dane Axe? This one over here? I'll go easy. I don't gotta prove myself anymore.
[2595.54s -> 2610.14s]  I just pogo stick through hard mode. Yeah. Clip that one. Why the Dane Axe? What's the
[2610.14s -> 2637.69s]  cool about the Dane Axe? Is this the thing they can chop off heads? Climb with it.
[2640.01s -> 2671.45s]  I'll give it a try. God, it really is getting over it. Just VR. This is hard. That's a lot
[2671.45s -> 2686.86s]  harder than it looks. I don't think I'm, okay, I'm not supposed to be up there. It's like,
[2686.86s -> 2691.54s]  it's a good wall. Because I'm clearly up here. That's the problem. See, look. Okay.
[2692.26s -> 2709.62s]  I'm, like, stuck on the edge. Bye! Okay, I'm fine. All right, let's do it. I'm just
[2709.62s -> 2712.95s]  gonna try to slaughter somebody with this. And then I gotta get out of here.
[2715.42s -> 2724.09s]  I'm past the point of tired at the moment. Burnt. All my fuel in my body has just turned into
[2724.09s -> 2733.66s]  burnt-out molecules. I'm gonna do an easy one. I wanna try to get somebody's head off.
[2733.66s -> 2786.18s]  Like, clean off. Oh, no! Hold on. Time out. Time out, please. Oh, my God. That's gotta
[2786.18s -> 2827.50s]  be nice and clean. Ah, come on. Close. I tried. Oh, that was perfect, too. Didn't
[2827.50s -> 2843.54s]  get the head off. Oh, no. That was an opportunity. Get back on the ground.
[2850.89s -> 2884.63s]  Pretty good technique. I thought that guy was, I thought he was undead. Got it. All right.
[2884.63s -> 2888.79s]  That's gonna be it. I'm gonna go get some water. I'll come back onto the bits. We'll
[2888.79s -> 2899.02s]  hang up a little bit. I am fucking exhausted. More blood. Not tonight. I'll be right back.
[2899.02s -> 3031.90s]  See you guys in a minute. That was weird. He was just still going, huh? They were
[3031.90s -> 3043.14s]  still fighting. Weirdly enough. Thanks, everybody, for watching. I'm fucking drained.
[3044.17s -> 3049.70s]  I gotta go take a shower. God, VR is so much fun. I wish I had the stamina to play it more.
[3049.70s -> 3057.50s]  I wish I wasn't such a boomer. But we're gonna do the bits. We're gonna hang up.
[3058.60s -> 3066.71s]  Shower stream. No. Think of it like getting really good exercise. Yeah, I know. It's
[3066.71s -> 3080.46s]  just spending four hours at the gym. Oh, Kiwo. Kiwo's still hanging around.
[3080.46s -> 3088.14s]  Kiwo, so what do you plan on the next few days? We were already talking.
[3089.82s -> 3097.42s]  And I'm not streaming tomorrow. I'm up in the air probably the next day or two. But
[3098.06s -> 3110.87s]  on tomorrow, today is Saturday, Sunday. On Monday or Tuesday, maybe we can figure
[3110.87s -> 3119.83s]  something out. Possibly. Wednesday? Thursday? You hurt your boyfriends and you abandoned him.
[3120.81s -> 3136.31s]  Oh, my. Oh, my. Why? What? That doesn't sound good. You're playing GTA RP? Oh, God.
[3136.95s -> 3159.50s]  I gotta stream. You gotta stream. RIP boyfriend. Yeah. Well, hopefully he understands.
[3160.86s -> 3169.74s]  Horrible girlfriend confirmed. But if you got time in the next week, I'll keep the VR
[3169.74s -> 3185.08s]  hooked up and we can do some shit. Should be fun. You're gonna have to give me a tour of
[3185.64s -> 3194.90s]  VR chat with extreme, with extreme limits put on it. I have to have like five people
[3194.90s -> 3201.53s]  with shields that walk in front of me. We made you a glue man avatar. That's fucking amazing.
[3201.53s -> 3216.98s]  Are you serious? I cannot wait to see that. That's unbelievable. Hit me up on Discord.
[3216.98s -> 3221.80s]  We'll talk more about it. But I'll be around Monday or Tuesday. Maybe we can set something up
[3221.80s -> 3227.40s]  for like Tuesday or something. Because when are you getting back? Give you a day to settle
[3228.20s -> 3242.12s]  whenever you're coming back. We have a rat related avatar. I cannot wait. It's just a
[3242.12s -> 3250.26s]  place to hang out and show off your expensive full body. That's fucking awesome. Surprise
[3250.26s -> 3256.04s]  avatar. I can't wait to see this. This is gonna be great. But yeah, thanks for the
[3256.04s -> 3263.10s]  raid again. Sorry we kind of stopped 2030 but it's after you came in. But I just I have no
[3263.10s -> 3274.06s]  stamina. Especially in this virtual world. The world that's in VR. No spoils. All right.
[3274.06s -> 3283.74s]  I'm looking forward to it. Whatever it is. But let's do the bits. Let's go back a few
[3283.74s -> 3293.48s]  hours ago. And we had five dollars coming from Afterlooksatrix. Thanks to the five
[3293.48s -> 3299.69s]  dollars. Hey Jerma, back in 2017 I sent a bit message saying I was going to France to meet
[3299.69s -> 3305.21s]  my boyfriend for the first time. Well this summer I'm moving in with him. Ain't that rad.
[3305.93s -> 3309.69s]  Anyway I've missed almost every live stream but I have watched every single VOD.
[3309.69s -> 3315.22s]  You have more fans than you realize. Say it with b-chat. Jerma Hart. And they say party party
[3315.22s -> 3328.52s]  party. That's awesome. That's amazing. What a perfect love story. Good shit. Thank you so
[3328.52s -> 3333.64s]  much for the five dollars. And I know it can be hard to catch every single stream. They
[3333.64s -> 3339.06s]  last a long time. So thanks for checking out the VODs and still hanging out. Being
[3339.06s -> 3351.00s]  part of the community. My first DM was an avatar and I never responded. No I just don't
[3351.00s -> 3364.34s]  even open up my Twitter. I opened my Twitter once to before my streams. To just say I'm
[3364.34s -> 3374.41s]  streaming. I don't ever write anything else. Kailer memeamoto thanks for the
[3375.53s -> 3381.66s]  three dollars here. They say Jerma loved your content ever since 2016. Don't know why but I
[3381.66s -> 3385.98s]  think your chat is too nice sometimes. It should be a little more mean to you.
[3386.78s -> 3404.34s]  Have you been here before? Are you sure you're in the right chat? It should be mean to me.
[3404.90s -> 3411.98s]  You know sometimes I've looked over here and saw like Jerma you suck. Fuck you.
[3411.98s -> 3415.26s]  It's happening right now. It's happening right now. It's happening right now.
[3415.98s -> 3428.33s]  Look over there and see it. But anyways. For real you've inspired me to make content of my own
[3429.21s -> 3434.39s]  and I'm blowing up on Instagram. The hellhole of all social media.
[3435.70s -> 3438.42s]  Earlier today I was talking to some girl on there and we met up at a local
[3440.02s -> 3459.70s]  you fucking had to do that. It was a walk-in. It was a walk-in open thing. But thank you
[3459.70s -> 3471.19s]  for three dollars. I appreciate it. Thank you lukewarm soda can for the two five
[3474.01s -> 3486.50s]  ten five ten fifteen. I guess we got some uh this is when I looked over it was like four out of
[3486.50s -> 3491.85s]  four right. Let's see. All right lukewarm soda can thank you for 250. I've got a story for
[3491.85s -> 3496.33s]  you about a weird dream I had. No joke. There's no punch line. It'll be four messages long.
[3496.33s -> 3499.37s]  So I'm at a wrestling event and as luck would have it I'm sitting next to Jerma.
[3499.85s -> 3505.29s]  I try talking to him. He can't hear me so I get closer. He can't hear me so I get closer.
[3505.29s -> 3508.73s]  He still can't hear me so I get closer until I'm right up against his face.
[3509.45s -> 3513.69s]  I say something along the lines of hey Jeremy did you see WrestleMania last week. It was
[3513.69s -> 3525.93s]  awesome. Um two two people died and Vince I'm cut off. What? As Jerma looks me in the eyes
[3525.93s -> 3531.93s]  stone-faced and tells me in a snobby voice I moved past that in my life then he turns to look at
[3531.93s -> 3537.05s]  his phone and says on it looking bored for the entire wrestling match. There's a girl with him
[3537.05s -> 3544.74s]  who some stripper name like Candy. What the fuck is this dream? Who is super into the event.
[3544.74s -> 3550.30s]  She keeps trying to get Jerma to watch but he refuses to look and looks pissed. A guy
[3550.30s -> 3555.66s]  walks down like in a baseball stadium selling concessions and asks Jerma if he'd like
[3557.18s -> 3563.74s]  anything with a. Jerma just repeats do you want anything back to him in a mocking voice
[3563.74s -> 3571.00s]  and keeps saying what did you what did you day aggressively at the concessions a guy
[3571.00s -> 3575.72s]  being a huge asshole and mocking the guy. I wouldn't be surprised if dream Jerma kicked.
[3578.42s -> 3583.30s]  What the fuck is going on here? Why do people have such strange dreams about me?
[3583.30s -> 3593.94s]  I'm not like this. I woke up after the main wrestler who is some weak useless shithead
[3596.50s -> 3599.54s]  and then finally I gotta do this all again. I need to know what the hell is going on here.
[3601.72s -> 3606.68s]  Talking about somebody's like head being exploded. I don't know anything about wrestling.
[3607.32s -> 3610.76s]  I've never even watched your streams for a few months because I've been busy at university.
[3610.76s -> 3619.51s]  I don't have the time to sit down and watch streams. What does my dream mean? I have no
[3619.51s -> 3631.30s]  idea. I have no idea what that means. I think that means that you just somehow put me into a
[3631.30s -> 3638.07s]  strange happenstance. I don't know why people have these weird dreams about me. This is like
[3638.07s -> 3645.10s]  number five in the last like two or three months but I appreciate it. Thank you for the
[3646.41s -> 3655.86s]  10 bucks here. Listen to Kiwo. Can we watch this? Yeah sure. What is this?
[3655.86s -> 3674.30s]  Hold on I gotta I gotta change my audio back to not the VR headset. Yeah super loud warning.
[3674.30s -> 3682.57s]  If this is this Titanic thing. Yeah lower the volume. This shit is loud. It's gonna hurt your
[3682.57s -> 3696.22s]  ears. I'm not kidding. Don't fuck around here. Okay let's go and watch this. I actually I
[3696.22s -> 3704.36s]  didn't get to really see this whole thing. Make it louder. All right let's look at it.
[3716.17s -> 3719.93s]  I've never watched this whole movie so I don't know exactly how the scene went down.
[3737.70s -> 3741.48s]  Oh it's beautiful Jack. It sure is.
[3747.58s -> 3754.14s]  All right let me put you down. Oh it's beautiful I know. Just watch out. Watch out for the railing.
[3754.14s -> 3764.78s]  The explosion.
[3770.57s -> 3782.14s]  The explosion when when the body lands. I was so fucking loud. Oh I probably killed somebody.
[3782.14s -> 3793.74s]  I'm so sorry. Imagine having that at full blast in a house with your TV on and speakers.
[3796.86s -> 3802.55s]  My goodness. But anyways let's uh move on to do the rest of the bits.
[3804.30s -> 3814.30s]  We had uh rain. Rage bow. Rage and bow. Thank you for the
[3815.90s -> 3819.18s]  bits here. The Titanic was so loud that my little sister came down to watch.
[3821.80s -> 3831.72s]  Sorry I said your name wrong. How would I mispronounce Tasty Turd? That's not possible.
[3831.72s -> 3841.08s]  It's very easy to say. It's a disgusting name. Why would I mispronounce that? Tasty Turd?
[3841.72s -> 3844.68s]  I know and you baited me but that's fine. I don't I know I was baited.
[3845.32s -> 3851.22s]  I had to screw up. I had to get that cleared up. Thank you Dorkcube for the 250. Man listens to
[3851.22s -> 3856.82s]  Celine Dion and loud sounds of rending metal. Well helping you with the rowing machine. The
[3856.82s -> 3867.21s]  sequel to man listening to loud farts and screams helps you lift weights. Oh VR is
[3867.21s -> 3877.24s]  fucking hilarious. It really is so much fun. Thank you Tom. Tom Cream for the five dollars
[3877.24s -> 3883.80s]  and one cent. No message just five bucks. Thank you Tom. Disinterest thanks for the five dollars.
[3883.80s -> 3887.72s]  Remember the Titanic chaos was the hardest I've laughed so far this year. Here's a few bits
[3887.72s -> 3899.94s]  as thanks. I'm glad you thought it was funny. It was fun to do so glad you liked it. Uh
[3899.94s -> 3906.60s]  Schwartzerade thanks for the five dollars. Screw that guy posting fan fiction. Smiley face.
[3907.24s -> 3914.10s]  What do you mean fan fiction? Thank you the five dollars though.
[3914.10s -> 3918.02s]  Oh did I just turn the stream off? No okay I just elbowed the I thought I just turned off the
[3918.02s -> 3924.06s]  stream. Thank you Lazy Luke for the three dollars twenty three cents. Last stream you talked a bit
[3924.06s -> 3927.93s]  about how you wanted that YouTube archive to keep the chat because people wanted to keep the
[3927.93s -> 3934.25s]  chat's reaction to the drunk VR stream. Disregarding the quality of the archive chat
[3934.25s -> 3938.49s]  extension is it fine for me to make my own stream archive website that displays chat
[3938.49s -> 3942.89s]  next to the video and is pretty much the same as if you had highlighted all your streams
[3942.97s -> 3947.13s]  and if the answer is yes then what's the difference to you actually highlighting all your streams?
[3949.10s -> 3957.74s]  Um I think the dip yeah I don't think the highlights don't keep uh chat do they? Do
[3957.74s -> 3963.54s]  highlights keep all of chat or is that only VODs? I don't think they do so that would be
[3963.54s -> 3980.33s]  the difference. Jeremy's too lazy to do that shit himself. No I mean they only keep chat
[3980.33s -> 3986.33s]  if the VOD still exists. Well yeah but I mean a VOD is deleted after 60 days so a highlight
[3986.33s -> 4009.11s]  of a VOD will always after 60 days not have chat. Okay so yeah but I think mostly that stream
[4009.11s -> 4019.16s]  archive channel on YouTube has everything there so I mean that's years of um highlights do keep
[4019.16s -> 4024.89s]  chat they do. I feel like it's like I'm going to be breaking it up into two places like if
[4024.89s -> 4030.74s]  you ever want to watch one of my VODs from a year ago you've got to go to another channel
[4030.74s -> 4034.74s]  you know what I mean? Oh but where do I watch that stream that you did? Oh we'll go to this
[4034.74s -> 4039.46s]  YouTube channel. What about this one? Oh it's here you know they're kind of in the same spot
[4039.46s -> 4047.37s]  so it's a little cleaner but if that if I can keep chat I really might have to just start
[4047.37s -> 4067.42s]  highlighting everything. It's probably time. Do I have the sorcery chat logs? No I do not.
[4068.30s -> 4081.82s]  Those that was years ago a long time ago. Well because remember that like three four
[4081.82s -> 4087.50s]  years ago I never I didn't think I was gonna want to save the chat I was just barely
[4087.50s -> 4094.31s]  streaming full time like more than three or four times a week. I had just started I didn't really
[4094.31s -> 4108.50s]  know the ins and outs completely. I still don't but let me look into that for real not just
[4108.50s -> 4113.77s]  like as the meme on the channel because if I can just keep them all here with chat
[4114.49s -> 4122.66s]  it's probably worth starting to do. Let me actually in super quotes like look into that
[4123.22s -> 4131.11s]  but thank you Lazy Luke and also for your 250 also sorry my last sorry for my last
[4131.11s -> 4138.94s]  message. What's wrong with your last message? It's a good thing to bring up obviously. I know
[4138.94s -> 4145.90s]  that's cool man don't worry. It's never gonna happen. No don't say that. You don't know that.
[4151.69s -> 4156.63s]  Thank you bop beep for the three bucks. Some empty cans of booze might have something to
[4156.63s -> 4162.55s]  do with that. I posted the wrong link. Anyways this puke talk has reminded me of this great
[4162.55s -> 4172.14s]  clip. Is this somebody puking? Hold on let me screen this. Yeah this is this is this is
[4172.14s -> 4181.16s]  somebody puking. This is the this is Vince McMahon. I don't think I want to play this
[4181.16s -> 4191.98s]  but I want to play this line here. I'm not gonna play that though because that made people
[4191.98s -> 4203.42s]  I don't think one have to see or hear that right now. Vince McMahon was fucking crazy.
[4210.01s -> 4220.82s]  Thank you though. Thank you to Jess you got it for the 250. Here we go guys Jess you got it.
[4221.38s -> 4230.47s]  Made lemon basil ice cream and they just tried it and we're gonna get a review. All right here's
[4230.47s -> 4236.78s]  the ice cream. It's really weird but I don't hate it. I think it's only as good as my ability
[4236.78s -> 4245.61s]  to make ice cream is. I'll probably make it again. That looks delicious. What's wrong with
[4245.61s -> 4257.91s]  that? It's good shit. It's good stuff. What you meant to say was my palette just was
[4257.91s -> 4263.67s]  enlightened. I could see colors after after I took a bite of this. I could see colors on
[4263.67s -> 4267.59s]  the spectrum we can't see for 10 seconds and then I had to take another bite to get to see
[4267.59s -> 4280.41s]  it again. Looks good though. It's got a lemon zest. Come on. Oh that's not a good thing.
[4280.41s -> 4283.53s]  Yeah I just like describe. I feel like that's what happens if you drink mercury.
[4286.15s -> 4302.76s]  I can see the whole other spectrum and then you die. So don't do that. Anyway C4G thanks
[4302.76s -> 4310.26s]  for the five dollars. Adorama you handsome little lad. Fuck it up and go get them.
[4310.26s -> 4320.86s]  And it's a bisexual pride. Handsome little lad. I'll take it. Thank you. Fuck it up and go get
[4320.86s -> 4333.14s]  them. I appreciate that. Thank you. Thanks for the five dollars. I missed community subs from
[4333.14s -> 4341.58s]  cure cure or cur. Thank you for the five community subs. I missed it an hour ago.
[4341.58s -> 4349.11s]  I was probably sprinting in place. So sorry I missed it. I also missed a 50 dollar donation.
[4350.22s -> 4357.69s]  What a bad streamer. Terrible streamer. Cat's beanie gave 5000 bits 50 bucks about an hour ago.
[4358.49s -> 4363.35s]  I'm not sure if you still here. I hope you are. You're the best fucking streamer. Also PS
[4363.35s -> 4367.99s]  be aware of your surroundings. I hit my wall playing my VR and snapped my controller in half.
[4367.99s -> 4375.43s]  Don't be like me. I I'm not even concerned about the controller as much as I am about
[4375.43s -> 4382.07s]  my desk. There are two big dents in this. This is a nice desk. I just got this when I moved to
[4382.07s -> 4387.91s]  Vegas. It's a beautiful walnut desk and I have smashed it as if I was hitting it with a hammer
[4387.91s -> 4393.59s]  like four times. There's at least two or three big big dents here. I fucked it all up. It's a
[4393.59s -> 4401.77s]  walnut desk and it cost a lot of money. It was at least at least like 180 bucks and at
[4401.77s -> 4405.21s]  most like five grand. It's somewhere in the middle. You'll figure it out.
[4406.17s -> 4419.72s]  It's not even close to five grand. I gave you a huge average potential.
[4424.04s -> 4428.68s]  It's not $5,000. I'm kidding. You think I'm I'm not gonna buy a $5,000 desk. I've ruined it.
[4432.60s -> 4436.63s]  Hey, Wince Ryan, thanks for three bucks. You may have been asked this already,
[4436.63s -> 4441.96s]  but are you planning on doing Labo VR? Reviews are saying it surprisingly does not
[4441.96s -> 4449.90s]  suck. Yes, I will. I will be doing Labo VR. Just not now. Probably in like a week or two.
[4450.62s -> 4459.42s]  I mean, if it's Labo, I have to do it. I'm gonna be the only streamer that's ever done all the
[4459.42s -> 4467.26s]  Labos. No one else can say that. Somebody might do one. I'm gonna do the car just the
[4467.26s -> 4471.98s]  car one. I'm talking one in the from the box. I'm the only goddamn person on this whole
[4471.98s -> 4480.50s]  website that did them all except for the submarine. Find me somebody else that can say
[4480.50s -> 4496.90s]  that. We're doing them all, but thank you. Uh, smelly boy, thanks for the $250. Can somebody
[4496.90s -> 4501.94s]  make an edit of Jerma killing people in Sword and Sorcery to Beware? The song Beware by
[4501.94s -> 4511.86s]  Death Grips. I'm sure somebody's capable of it, but thank you. Uh, Wild. Thank you Wild
[4511.86s -> 4520.78s]  Hike for the $245. Ah, I'm not supposed to be reading this, but you hit a growth spurt.
[4520.78s -> 4539.08s]  Room's not bigger. Shader! Thank you though. Pika Banana, thanks for the $5. Thank you Pika
[4539.08s -> 4542.60s]  Banana. I had to work today early in the morning and I've been pretty tired all day,
[4542.60s -> 4547.24s]  but then I saw you were online and watching your high-energy VR antics brightened me up.
[4547.24s -> 4555.90s]  You never fail to make me laugh, Jerma Hart. I appreciate that, thank you. I do burn myself
[4555.90s -> 4564.54s]  out in these VR streams though. It's like a 50% faster drain. If I'm not doing VR,
[4565.50s -> 4579.99s]  streams are six to eight hours long. I get, it's like a 100% increase, sometimes longer. Yeah,
[4579.99s -> 4586.86s]  it's just, it's draining. You gotta find the right VR games. Yeah, I mean sometimes I can do
[4586.86s -> 4590.14s]  it for a while. It's just when you get into room scaling, you start moving around and
[4590.14s -> 4594.22s]  like running around in place and crouching and standing up and moving. It's like you're doing
[4594.22s -> 4598.97s]  yoga for four hours. People don't even do yoga for like 40 minutes before they stop,
[4603.19s -> 4614.49s]  but I still love it though. It's a lot of fun. Jerma lied about Fruity Loops thanks to the $2.50.
[4615.13s -> 4619.05s]  If you aren't going to play Fruity Loops, then you should at least play Google Earth VR.
[4619.77s -> 4626.14s]  I'm gonna gotta play Fruity Loops, so don't worry. It'll look like a year. I don't know,
[4626.14s -> 4634.98s]  maybe. Let's get the credits rolling. Thank you everybody for your subs and thanks guys.
[4635.94s -> 4642.30s]  I mean when I get really tired, I do that. Okay guys, so let's have a look and
[4645.00s -> 4648.60s]  it's filler for my brain to make up a sentence or get a word out,
[4657.30s -> 4662.06s]  but let's get the credits rolling. Here come all the new subs and all the old subs and everybody.
[4663.30s -> 4677.38s]  Thank you for your support. Wait, when was Joel here? Did Joel show up at some point
[4677.38s -> 4690.55s]  that I missed it? Oh well, apparently I missed it. Was it gifted? Oh he's very sneaky, very
[4690.55s -> 4699.72s]  sneaky about that. No, he was one of the gifted subs. That's awesome. A few more bits have come
[4699.72s -> 4709.10s]  in here the last 10-15 minutes as we watch the credits roll. Maxi Kaspersky thanks for the
[4709.10s -> 4713.66s]  three dollars. I was listening to this in the background as I got some work done, but I had
[4713.66s -> 4718.30s]  to put it on the main screen after I heard the sound of your knuckles impacting on your walls.
[4718.86s -> 4726.26s]  Great as always. And they say Kiwo stream hype. When's the Germa V Joel gamer challenge? We
[4726.26s -> 4733.22s]  actually talked about it. Joel is apparently very busy, so we might do something a little
[4733.22s -> 4738.10s]  different. We might come together and collaborate on something soon. He was busy
[4738.10s -> 4744.47s]  working on a lot of stuff, so we're going to come together and probably collab on something
[4744.47s -> 4759.02s]  special. So he admits you're the better gamer. Something like that. All that trash talk.
[4760.17s -> 4763.93s]  Now we've talked about it a couple times. He's out, he has a lot of projects that he's
[4763.93s -> 4773.61s]  working on right now, so we're gonna do something. When is it? I haven't, I'm not
[4773.61s -> 4781.03s]  sure. I have to get that information from him, but thank you. Thank you Freudian Weapon
[4781.03s -> 4783.83s]  for the floor at all. This VR looks like a hell of a workout. Kudos on playing it for
[4783.83s -> 4790.10s]  so long. If that were me, I'd be done in 20 minutes. Yeah, I mean, it got close. I was
[4790.10s -> 4795.70s]  sitting there when I was doing in the chair VR and moving around and tilting my head around,
[4795.70s -> 4801.48s]  but being completely still in the chair, I had only been streaming for like an hour and 40
[4801.48s -> 4806.84s]  minutes. I thought I had, I was, I almost had to stop. If I didn't stand up and just take
[4806.84s -> 4809.32s]  the headset off and move around for a little bit, I was gonna have to stop streaming.
[4810.28s -> 4816.84s]  So thankfully I was able to go for longer, you know? But it is a workout, but it's a
[4816.84s -> 4831.66s]  lot of fun. And that juicy bit has an incredibly nice message. They say,
[4831.66s -> 4834.94s]  Jeremy, you're seriously the biggest inspiration in my life. You don't know it as we never have,
[4834.94s -> 4838.70s]  literally never spoken, but you've shaped me into the person I have become today.
[4839.26s -> 4841.82s]  You're hilarious, intelligent, handsome, and everything I strive to be.
[4842.62s -> 4846.30s]  I speak for myself and everyone here when I say that I love you and I wish you a long
[4846.30s -> 4852.84s]  and prosperous life and career. That's a shitload of incredibly fucking wonderful things
[4852.84s -> 4856.52s]  to hear. I'm honored and humbled. I can't believe that somebody would say something like
[4856.52s -> 4866.47s]  that. So thank you. I hope you can take something fun from the streams. I hope
[4867.83s -> 4875.96s]  if I do inspire somebody, I hope it's for good, you know? So thank you. I really appreciate
[4875.96s -> 4889.00s]  that. But that is my time. I am going to go take a bath, like the hottest bath I've ever
[4889.00s -> 4898.30s]  taken. I am not going to be live tomorrow and depending on a few factors, I'm going
[4898.30s -> 4906.06s]  to get in touch with Kiwo. Kiwo, if you're still here. Looking at possibly like Monday
[4906.06s -> 4921.91s]  or Tuesday, right? Not going to be a lot. No, not going to be live tomorrow,
[4921.91s -> 4928.36s]  but we're going to figure it out. I'll get sus updated when I got, I'm making a mind show
[4928.36s -> 4935.38s]  clip. Wait, what do you mean? Please tell me you didn't see the mind show stuff that I was
[4935.38s -> 4941.86s]  doing at the end. I'm going to give you a key word here. Did you or did you not see
[4941.86s -> 4955.80s]  QRS? QRS. That is fucking embarrassing. Oh, I got to do it. I got to do it, right?
[4959.72s -> 4975.02s]  QRS. Every single one of them. Watch their fucking arms. I'm fucking insane. He's still
[4975.02s -> 4981.16s]  drunk. I want to do another mind show stream. I just had a bunch of technical problems with
[4981.16s -> 4988.36s]  it. I got like some kind of sinking issues. I got soft locked on the table. So I think
[4988.36s -> 5000.54s]  I'm just going to come back to it because it was a lot of fun, but I will see you guys
[5001.34s -> 5007.88s]  soon. Wait, Kim check. Oh no, Kim's not in there. Don't worry. Hopefully you've
[5007.88s -> 5016.94s]  enjoyed the VR recently, the last three streams here in a row. All right. I'm going
[5016.94s -> 5022.31s]  to leave you a mind show clip. You can respond for our collaboration. You mean like
[5022.31s -> 5027.27s]  right now on stream or you mean like in discord? If you got it, I'll watch it now.
[5028.07s -> 5042.46s]  You got it now? No. Okay. Okay. Well send me that clip. I'm drunk off my ass. Hey,
[5042.46s -> 5054.81s]  well I was there like two days ago, three days ago. Drunk VR is worst VR or best VR,
[5054.81s -> 5062.30s]  depending on who you ask. I'll see you guys soon. I'll see, if not on Monday,
[5062.30s -> 5065.74s]  we'll see you Tuesday. Take care of yourselves. Have a great rest of your weekend.
[5065.74s -> 5069.50s]  Thanks for watching as always. See you soon.
