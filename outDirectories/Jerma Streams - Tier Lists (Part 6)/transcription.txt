[1.27s -> 9.45s]  Okay, I'm back. Back. I have clothes on, kind of. Don't worry, I have enough clothing on where I'm
[10.01s -> 27.62s]  good. All right, let me come back here. Make sure I think I'm not naked. No, I'm not. I'm going E3
[27.62s -> 57.08s]  mode right now. I'm going E3 outfit. All right, let me do this. Uh, can you see me? Just better
[57.08s -> 71.32s]  not have a fucking frame of me naked or something. Let me just make sure it doesn't. Uh, that was
[71.32s -> 96.28s]  Watchdog Legions. Uh, stand up. No. No, I won't. Evil Agent Jerma? Uh, that was worse than FTK. Come on.
[105.14s -> 120.15s]  Oof. Everybody stand up. Stand, coward. Look, what do you want? What do you mean stand up? Look,
[120.15s -> 127.26s]  I'm wearing a robe. I'm wearing my gown that I wear every night and I relax at home.
[130.17s -> 140.09s]  Stand up. I'm standing as, I'm standing up. Open it. This is staying as tight to the chest as I
[140.09s -> 157.51s]  can get it. Arms to the sky. All right. I look like a fucking dinner table. What's today? Ooh,
[157.51s -> 165.53s]  mashed potatoes. Chicken, fried chicken. I love that. All right, let's go. Put a shirt on. I don't
[165.53s -> 171.24s]  care. I'm going. I have a shirt. This is a big one. Let me just capture my fucking window.
[171.24s -> 185.56s]  Oh, this is not a shirt. It's a huge, it's a huge shirt. Okay. Window capture. What even is being
[185.56s -> 197.50s]  captured right now? I have no fucking idea. Okay. All right. Here we go. This is Jerma Meltdown
[197.50s -> 231.70s]  tier list. I don't know what you can see. Where am I? Uh, some of these aren't fair. All right.
[231.70s -> 236.74s]  This, the way this camera is set up, someone's coming out of there in five minutes and strangling
[236.74s -> 244.33s]  me from behind. You know, like, oh yeah, I just, hey guys, perfect fucking view of that closet.
[245.45s -> 254.68s]  No one's coming out of there with like a knife. I don't, it's Halloween, man. Freaking me out.
[254.68s -> 265.21s]  You're in the wrong category. I'll change it. I'll get it. Category we in? Legion of grandmas.
[265.21s -> 275.29s]  How about, should I just write watchdogs sucks. Pivoting to tier lists. It really doesn't suck
[275.29s -> 288.89s]  though. My computer sucks. My computer sucks. Tier lists for 10 minutes. No, how about just my,
[288.89s -> 308.50s]  my computer sucks. There you go. Okay. Here we go. Uh, I'm actually going to zoom this in because,
[309.30s -> 319.46s]  all right, so this is, these are the, these are the worst meltdowns I've had on stream.
[320.10s -> 326.41s]  Start with Katamari. Beautiful Katamari. I, I don't know if that was true. That's probably a C.
[328.95s -> 335.83s]  This is Chili Time. Uh, Chili Time is probably an S because I remember being hurt. I hurt myself
[335.83s -> 342.42s]  on this stream. Like an hour after that stream ended, I like actually, my, my, I hurt myself.
[343.14s -> 349.77s]  Uh, and I do remember that being unbearable. Dark Souls, I beat it. It was good. The game was fun.
[349.85s -> 359.19s]  I would say that's, no, Katamari is higher than that. Dark Souls 3? No, not really. Dead Rising 2
[359.19s -> 362.79s]  was not really a meltdown. It was just, that was fun. I had a lot of fun in Dead Rising 2.
[365.00s -> 370.01s]  Uh, these are up here. I think I specifically started, I remember specifically talking about
[370.01s -> 375.94s]  how the games are getting way too hard and how much I hate every video game or something during
[375.94s -> 385.34s]  this, right? Hotline Miami 2, way more than Hotline Miami 1. Jump King is S. I remember that was
[385.34s -> 393.94s]  horrible. No, I wouldn't put Lifeline's probably around B. Ario Tennis was one of the only times
[393.94s -> 401.69s]  really on stream ever that I was actually angry. Truly angry. Upset. Very, very angry. And not
[401.69s -> 406.17s]  like, oh, like, like tonight, right? Tonight. It's like, oh, watch dogs. Hey, what the fuck?
[406.17s -> 411.69s]  Oh, that stream was, oh, that sucked. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. I was like, I fucking hated
[411.69s -> 419.40s]  every second of playing that game. Every second of it. I was like, I hate this. Uh, I, I hated
[419.40s -> 425.16s]  being on, I hated the stream. I hated the fucking game. I hated the, the Switch or whatever dumb,
[425.16s -> 433.50s]  whatever it was, the Wii U at that point, whatever it was. Shit, this is up there too. Lord of the
[433.50s -> 440.90s]  Rings, the two towers. I mean, this, I think this has to trump this because this is the
[441.70s -> 453.42s]  longest stream I've ever done. This is 13, 14 hour long stream. Yeah, that's probably the
[453.42s -> 461.98s]  longest. Oh, Dom was just stupid and broken and hurt everybody's ears. I don't know if Sekiro is
[461.98s -> 479.02s]  over Hotline Miami. It might be. Especially that last boss. Hmm. I'm going to leave it there for
[479.02s -> 487.99s]  now. Monkey Ball was, hmm, probably more than, no. Probably, nah, probably more than Katamari.
[487.99s -> 501.70s]  You spent two hours on it. On the ape? Yeah, that's true. I did. Uh, the thing is S. I always gauge
[501.70s -> 509.51s]  on how high up on a list like this, that this has to be. If I like talk shit about the developers
[509.51s -> 516.12s]  of the game, that's very important, right? The amount of times that I was like, why did they do
[516.12s -> 528.98s]  this? What were they fucking thinking? Like that's how I can tell that it should be up here. Stuntman
[528.98s -> 545.29s]  Ignition was just fun. Okay, now I have to, I have to get this right. Simpsons was definitely worse
[545.29s -> 549.37s]  than Hotline Miami. Simpsons was definitely worse than Chilly Time. We have to, we're going to demote
[549.37s -> 557.83s]  Chilly Time. Hit and run is S. Yeah, it definitely is. Uh, was hit and run more of a mouth down than
[557.83s -> 572.12s]  Jump King? I don't think so. Was it? I feel like these two are on par with each other.
[572.12s -> 585.93s]  Have you seen the stream? I lived it, bro. Why did my face look like it just was like going like
[585.93s -> 601.96s]  this? That was weird. I think this is accurate because this is just, this was not really meltdown.
[601.96s -> 623.13s]  This was anger. Yeah, I think that's correct. Now it's correct. Now it's good. There you go.
[623.13s -> 627.21s]  There's, uh, there's the, me ranking the times that I've, oh, and where would I put the Watch Dogs
[627.21s -> 635.26s]  Legion stream? Probably like here. That was just the bad. I didn't have like a meltdown. I just,
[635.26s -> 643.77s]  my computer crashed like five times and I had to download drivers. And this whole stream was like
[643.77s -> 650.74s]  a fucking mess, but this wasn't a meltdown stream. This was a mess stream behind you.
[650.74s -> 665.18s]  But you think that opened? Shelf is collapsing. Oh, make sure you get a good view. All right,
[665.18s -> 682.79s]  there's the next one. This is a Ubisoft tier list. It should be pretty easy. Uh, okay. I can't even,
[682.79s -> 690.18s]  what are some of these? Assassin's Creed Origins. I didn't play it. Assassin's Creed Reincarnation?
[690.50s -> 695.05s]  I can't read that. Assassin's Creed 3. Assassin's Creed Rogue. That's like an iPad game.
[695.05s -> 701.29s]  Assassin's Creed 2. Assassin's Creed. Assassin's Creed Black Flag. Assassin's Creed Revelations.
[701.29s -> 706.15s]  Assassin's Creed. No, I didn't play any of these fucking games. Assassin's Creed Odyssey. None of
[706.15s -> 718.74s]  them. Uh, okay. Where's, uh, this is Far Cry Classic. This game is an F. I just want to make
[718.74s -> 728.09s]  sure everyone's aware of this. This game is not good. It's, I mean, at the time, at the time,
[728.09s -> 735.99s]  it was a very, it was amazing for graphics and fidelity and draw distance, but the video game
[735.99s -> 745.46s]  is actually really bad. It's not good. People wanted me to play this and I was like, oh yeah,
[745.46s -> 749.06s]  Far Cry. And then I remembered this is the game where people can shoot you literally that have
[749.06s -> 760.68s]  not been generated by the map yet. You can get shot through walls. Okay. No, I think it should
[760.68s -> 765.40s]  be there. It's probably, it's better than Far Cry. No, Far Cry, was Far Cry 5 really that bad?
[766.04s -> 776.15s]  Do I even like any Ubisoft games? Why do I play them? I feel like every single one of these I
[776.15s -> 782.39s]  would put like in D. Do I like any of these games? Although I have, I'll be honest, I never played a
[782.39s -> 795.46s]  whole lot of the Assassin's Creed stuff. This is like, this game was good. It's Beyond Good and
[795.46s -> 801.50s]  Evil, right? No, that was, this was good. You know, it would be really great to see Beyond Good and
[801.50s -> 821.19s]  Evil 2 and not Assassin's Creed 15. I played all the Rayman games when I was younger. I remember
[821.19s -> 828.73s]  really liking them though. I have not played a Rayman game in a long time. Where's Raving Rabbids?
[828.73s -> 838.09s]  That's S tier. Don't you think it's funny? Well, no, No More Heroes 2 is not. No. I'm sorry. I have
[838.09s -> 850.82s]  to be completely honest with everybody in myself. No More Heroes 2 is not S tier. It's, it's very
[850.82s -> 863.34s]  good. I think No More Heroes 1 is better. Let's make this right. Okay. Assassin's Creed Unity.
[863.34s -> 869.85s]  I didn't play the Prince of Persia remake. I didn't play any of these. I don't even know
[869.85s -> 872.57s]  what the game this is, but I know I didn't play it. I don't know what game this is, but I know I
[872.57s -> 877.16s]  didn't. Wait, this is Far Cry. Which Far Cry is that? Is that Far Cry 2? That's the good one.
[878.98s -> 887.83s]  Ends of Time is the only good one. Far Cry Primal. No, I didn't play it. I didn't play it. This is
[887.83s -> 893.64s]  Rayman. It's going up here. Oh, this is Rayman Origins, right? Rayman, no, what's the new one?
[893.64s -> 899.86s]  The one that came out not that long ago, like five years ago. This one, this was good. This was
[899.86s -> 914.74s]  actually pretty very, this is the good one. I think that's accurate. Uh, Watch Dogs. You know what?
[914.74s -> 922.57s]  Like, I'm going to be, I have to be honest with everybody. I have to, I just have to be honest
[922.57s -> 935.83s]  with you. I really don't, I don't think these are good. They're probably better than, the problem is
[935.83s -> 941.27s]  like these are like all the same, all the things that are on E right now are the same game with
[941.27s -> 947.11s]  just like some differences, like open world with like a bunch of random missions to do, but like
[947.11s -> 951.59s]  one is like a hacker and one you like drive around and like get shot at by like religious people,
[952.15s -> 960.50s]  right? Cult. I put these, these on the same exact category. Like to me, they blend together as the
[960.50s -> 983.19s]  same game. I think I just don't like Watch Dogs. Two was better. I actually do remember playing Two
[983.19s -> 994.01s]  and it was, it was fun for a little bit. It was. Yeah, I think I just don't like Far, I think I
[994.01s -> 1003.06s]  just don't like Watch Dogs. What's wrong with me? I didn't really like Watch Dogs One. I didn't
[1003.06s -> 1012.33s]  really like Watch Dogs Two. So let me buy Watch Dogs Three and stream it on launch and be excited
[1012.41s -> 1027.37s]  for it. When the first two games I would put down at E tier. Why did I do that? Yeah, I gotta be
[1027.37s -> 1032.94s]  honest. I just don't think I like the games. I see there, I see how people could think that they're
[1032.94s -> 1042.94s]  fun. Backtracking Barry. He's back, backtracking. No, I'm not. This is a me. I'm forward tracking.
[1042.94s -> 1047.18s]  Okay, there's so many games in this list. I thought this was the list of things that haven't been put
[1047.18s -> 1057.94s]  up yet. Oh wow. Okay. What's next? Assassin's Creed? Oh no. Okay. Don't look at me. All right.
[1057.94s -> 1066.17s]  So let this be, let's be a future reference. Don't ever invite me to like an Ubisoft event
[1066.17s -> 1075.14s]  because very clearly, oh man, I didn't get invited to the Ubisoft party. What the fuck? They didn't
[1075.14s -> 1084.39s]  put me on the list of streamers, but I have played 1% of their whole catalog of video games. What the
[1084.39s -> 1094.26s]  heck? Why won't they talk to me? I don't play any of their games. What? You mean my name was glossed
[1094.26s -> 1101.24s]  over when I could have been like a VIP at like the Ubisoft like conference? Name one game you've
[1101.24s -> 1115.98s]  completed that was an Ubisoft game. No More Heroes and No More Heroes 2. Those are the only
[1115.98s -> 1126.66s]  Ubisoft games that I have completed. Every single other game on this list has been played
[1128.20s -> 1151.42s]  for a maximum of four hours. Wait, where's For Honor? Where is it? I'm sorry. It's like,
[1151.42s -> 1156.66s]  I can't even see, like, okay. I feel like Assassin's Creed, Assassin's Creed, which one?
[1157.30s -> 1161.54s]  These are all just different cards. You know, like the collectible Marvel cards. This is just
[1161.54s -> 1166.49s]  different artist depictions that you collect in that series. It's just like, I can't even just,
[1166.49s -> 1169.85s]  all right. This is like the Hulk, but like kind of metal. This is like
[1171.13s -> 1178.09s]  intergalactic Hulk. This is, this is She-Hulk. There's, okay, this is Deadpool. Like, I feel
[1178.09s -> 1188.90s]  like I'm just collecting fucking the cards of the same character. Where is For Honor? There it is.
[1188.90s -> 1205.56s]  Okay, it gets a D. Deadpool is the Hulk. Yeah, the only, I don't play any of their catalog. I've
[1205.56s -> 1212.55s]  never, I don't even, why would I play Ubisoft games? These two aren't even Ubisoft games.
[1213.11s -> 1224.78s]  And yeah, because every time like the Ubisoft does like a big press conference thing or like
[1224.78s -> 1232.84s]  an E3 thing, I just skip it. I just don't even, I just stop watching. I think the only time that
[1232.84s -> 1242.68s]  I ever watched a Ubisoft conference is when I was on stream with you guys. I'm roasting them.
[1242.68s -> 1267.16s]  I'm not though. This is just me. Is that Far Cry 3? Where's Far Cry 2? Wait, wasn't Red Steel kind
[1267.16s -> 1280.84s]  of good? Why do I remember this being kind of fun? I might be thinking of a different game. No,
[1280.84s -> 1296.14s]  I didn't play any of the South Park games either. Yeah, no, this list is done. No, I haven't played
[1296.14s -> 1302.57s]  South Park. Why is Black Flag so low? Black Flag is so low because it's the only Assassin's Creed
[1302.57s -> 1308.01s]  game that I've ever played for more than four or five hours. And I don't remember. It definitely
[1308.01s -> 1317.19s]  should be in front of, yeah, above Red Steel. Well, yeah, this has been an eye-opening stream
[1317.19s -> 1333.21s]  for me. Just got removed off of all the Ubisoft content creator email lists. Okay, this is
[1333.21s -> 1344.34s]  artificial flavors. What is the best artificial flavor? This is going to be really hard. I know
[1344.34s -> 1362.71s]  that for certain. I know the grape for certain. Grape and watermelon. Terry's up there too,
[1362.71s -> 1369.26s]  but I don't wear banana. Okay, when I think about artificial flavoring, I think of hard candy,
[1370.33s -> 1375.56s]  but I love banana cream pie. It's one of my favorite things ever. And there's just banana
[1375.56s -> 1384.95s]  flavoring that some people put in banana cream pie. Does that count? It counts. It's just like
[1384.95s -> 1392.10s]  an added artificial banana flavoring. It goes up here then. I know if I put banana up at S tier,
[1392.10s -> 1396.42s]  then like there's people buried under my floorboards. I get it, but there's not.
[1396.74s -> 1408.02s]  But I like it. Strawberry, eh, hit or miss. Second grape, okay. I actually don't really like
[1408.02s -> 1414.41s]  artificial orange or artificial lemon. Artificial lemon just tastes like heartburn. That's like the
[1414.41s -> 1422.66s]  flavor it is when you like burp up fucking heartburn. Blue raspberry, that's A. Green apple,
[1422.66s -> 1432.73s]  that's A. Peach, artificial peach flavoring is just kind of like battery acid. I don't like it.
[1432.73s -> 1437.98s]  It's trying to, no, it tastes like perfume. Artificial peach flavoring just tastes like
[1437.98s -> 1458.54s]  you're drinking, like eating perfume. I think this is good. How do you know? I'm just, I'm
[1458.54s -> 1469.18s]  just guessing, man. Watermelon sucks? No, it does not. You eat a watermelon Jolly Rancher right now,
[1469.18s -> 1472.22s]  son. And then you come to me and you come back to this stream telling me it was bad.
[1479.86s -> 1484.34s]  Watermelon's the only thing in the right place. Grape? You don't think that grape belongs here?
[1490.54s -> 1503.43s]  No? Grape flavoring? Like a grape popsicle? Grape is baste. Yeah, it is. Cherry's miles better than
[1503.43s -> 1512.55s]  grape. I'll tell you that cherry's probably better than banana. I think this is good.
[1512.55s -> 1522.57s]  Grape is B tier. How could you say something like that? All right, I like it. It's, yeah,
[1522.57s -> 1529.37s]  cough syrup. Maybe that's why I like it. Because when I was a little kid, there was that dimetap
[1529.37s -> 1534.82s]  had, it was grape dimetap. And I remember being like, holy shit, this is the greatest thing I've
[1534.82s -> 1538.82s]  ever eaten in my life. Whenever I had like a cold or a cough or something when I was a little kid.
[1539.38s -> 1549.90s]  You guys don't remember that? How it would be, oh, grape dimetap. And when you were a little kid,
[1549.90s -> 1564.23s]  it was like, oh my god, it's like candy! But it wasn't. You're leaning? You're a crackhead.
[1564.23s -> 1571.75s]  What? Because I said the artificial grape flavoring was good in dimetap when I was like 11?
[1574.34s -> 1579.54s]  No, I don't like put it in fucking Coke or Sprite or anything. I'm talking about just the flavor.
[1579.54s -> 1596.65s]  It was a great grape jolly rancher flavor. Oh, sandwiches. Oh, I'm gonna get attacked over these.
[1596.65s -> 1603.72s]  This is gonna be okay. Bacon, egg and cheese. That's S tier. It's fucking unbelievable.
[1603.72s -> 1609.54s]  A grilled cheese. That depends. Is this a sad grilled cheese that you make at two o'clock
[1609.54s -> 1612.98s]  in the morning because you don't have any food in your fridge? You just have slices of cheese
[1612.98s -> 1620.20s]  and bread? Or is this like a hipster restaurant where they give you a grilled cheese, but it's
[1620.20s -> 1624.12s]  actually a bunch of other shit that they pretend it is a grilled cheese and it's super super
[1624.12s -> 1632.28s]  like ritzy and uppity? Which one? Because I'll tell you. The one that I make at two o'clock
[1632.28s -> 1636.52s]  in the morning goes up here. The one that's from the restaurant where they make it, they like dress
[1636.52s -> 1645.06s]  it up a lot, is down here. Ah, that's pulled pork sandwich. That's S tier. That's a bon meat. That's B.
[1646.01s -> 1652.71s]  BLT, F. I wish I could give it an F. I wish I could say like put immediately into a garbage can.
[1652.71s -> 1658.58s]  BLT is a scam. It's a way for you to buy a sandwich without buying a sandwich and
[1658.58s -> 1661.94s]  somebody made it up. Somebody just was like, yeah, let me put like some of the shit that
[1661.94s -> 1668.86s]  people put on top of salad. Here's like condiments in between two pieces of bread. That sounds great.
[1668.86s -> 1679.67s]  No, there's not enough. You're missing the thing that goes underneath all that.
[1679.67s -> 1686.09s]  I'll never understand a BLT. What do you put on your hamburger? Lettuce, tomato and bacon.
[1686.73s -> 1689.77s]  What do you put on like a ham sandwich? I put lettuce and tomato on a ham sandwich.
[1690.41s -> 1695.61s]  Um, what do you put on a, what do you put on a tuna fish sandwich? Lettuce, maybe a slice of cheese.
[1695.61s -> 1702.46s]  Maybe, maybe, maybe a tomato. What do you put on a BLT? That's just it. It's just tomato and lettuce.
[1702.46s -> 1707.27s]  And then you put bacon on top of it. And bacon is supposed to be the protein part,
[1707.27s -> 1717.22s]  but that's just an extra. It's an additive. You have something else there. Cheese on tuna?
[1717.22s -> 1720.74s]  Yeah, a tuna fish sandwich. You never have cheese on tuna fish sandwich. It's good. Just like a
[1720.74s -> 1725.90s]  slice of American cheese. That's what a tuna melt is. How have you not had a tuna melt?
[1726.47s -> 1731.67s]  No, I just don't, I just don't think BLTs are that I would, look, I would eat it and I would
[1732.66s -> 1738.41s]  be happy with it, but I wouldn't be, I wouldn't order it. Because a lot of times a BLT is like
[1738.41s -> 1751.54s]  eight bucks and the large steak and cheese sub is 8.50. You're getting scammed. Just go and buy
[1751.54s -> 1760.15s]  a head of lettuce and go buy four tomatoes and a pound of bacon and you can eat BLTs for a month.
[1760.15s -> 1769.40s]  Move on. No, this is important to me. Holy shit French dip. Oh fucking get up to S. Are you
[1769.40s -> 1776.02s]  kidding me? Thanksgiving sandwich that goes up in front of that. Italian sub, they can be a little
[1776.02s -> 1787.83s]  watery. I don't know. They could get soggy. They're okay. Lobster roll? Uh, yeah. Turkey club? No,
[1787.83s -> 1794.09s]  too annoying. Too, it's annoying because you like, you have to open your mouth a little,
[1794.09s -> 1800.57s]  wicked huge and you end up going right on to the, like just the corner. You can only bite the corner
[1800.57s -> 1806.57s]  and when you bite the corner, every single thing inside just shoots out and you have to like,
[1807.13s -> 1820.78s]  oops, that's why they had the stupid little thing in there. This is baste. I'm getting a lot of baste
[1820.78s -> 1829.86s]  today. Uh, cheese steak. Fuck. I love cheese steak so much. I really do. Fried chicken sandwich. I
[1829.86s -> 1834.58s]  love sandwiches. This is going to be very hard. This might be the hardest tier list that you guys
[1834.58s -> 1841.88s]  have linked me. Um, okay. I just, I don't know what this is. This looks like a, this looks like a kit
[1841.88s -> 1856.07s]  cat bar with the chocolate taken off. I don't know what it is. Uh, tuna melt. Oh fuck. Meatball sub.
[1856.07s -> 1867.66s]  Fuck. A Reuben. Oh man, there's too many S tier sandwiches here. A, a gyro fucking S tier. I don't
[1867.66s -> 1874.38s]  know what that is. Oh, Cuban sandwich. Come on. Come on, Gwen. That's better than grilled cheese.
[1874.38s -> 1881.26s]  Patty melt. These are all, I, there's too many. Roast beef. Disgusting. I hate roast beef. Come on.
[1881.26s -> 1890.46s]  Come on. Come on. Let's hear it. I wrote, wrote what? Cold meat. Cold meat. No. Give me this. Give
[1890.46s -> 1895.70s]  me the French dip. Actually heat it up and put it in the sandwich like fucking real. I don't,
[1895.70s -> 1905.88s]  cold roast beef that you get. No. It just, it tastes like it came out of somebody's trash.
[1905.88s -> 1911.32s]  Every time that I bite into or smell roast beef that comes from the deli, it just smells like
[1911.32s -> 1919.30s]  old trash. You guys aren't actually using Arby's as a barometer for good roast beef sandwiches,
[1919.30s -> 1936.84s]  are you? Just because they say that in the commercial doesn't mean it's any good. Arby's
[1936.84s -> 1950.07s]  is okay. It's not good. Quiznos. Quiznos disappeared. Reviewers are dropping because of this. I feel
[1950.07s -> 1955.96s]  like my roast beef opinion is not an unpopular one. You guys want to talk about a boomer food?
[1955.96s -> 1960.89s]  A roast beef sandwich is like the ultimate boomer food. You want to be like a boomer?
[1965.72s -> 1974.31s]  Egg salad? It depends, but usually pretty good. Peanut butter and jelly. I'd put fluff on there
[1974.31s -> 1990.74s]  instead and I'd be happier. Monte Cristo. Too heavy, but very, very tasty. Torta. A. A standard
[1990.74s -> 1995.75s]  ham and cheese sandwich. No, I'm putting it down here at D, not because I don't like it,
[1995.75s -> 2004.57s]  because this is like the go-to when I have nothing else to eat. So I don't really want
[2004.57s -> 2014.20s]  a ham and cheese sandwich with just lettuce on it. But if I have to eat it, I'll enjoy it.
[2014.20s -> 2024.06s]  Nah, it's just, no. I'd rather it be like turkey, mayo, provolone. Ham is... I'm not a big ham fan.
[2024.06s -> 2033.96s]  I'm really not. A Cuban sandwich is way better. Egg salad is gross? Why is egg salad gross?
[2033.96s -> 2043.96s]  You have too many S tiers. I know, I'll work on it. I don't know what that is.
[2043.96s -> 2051.37s]  Falafel pita. I'd rather it be a gyro. Chicken salad. Fuck yeah, get up there.
[2051.37s -> 2059.64s]  A bologna and cheese sandwich. It's only gonna go up to B because it's what I ate every single day
[2059.64s -> 2078.20s]  from the ages of 8 to 20 during the hours of 11 to 2 p.m. It was eaten almost every day.
[2078.20s -> 2088.94s]  These two? Where's tuna? Just a tuna fish sandwich. Cucumber tea? It's a cucumber sandwich?
[2088.94s -> 2100.66s]  How have they made the BLT even shittier? This is just, this is just L. Wait, you just put two
[2100.66s -> 2113.14s]  pieces of cucumber between bread? Somebody like had to turn their homework in, in 10 minutes,
[2113.14s -> 2117.48s]  and they're in homeroom. And they're like, fuck, I gotta come up with a sandwich.
[2117.48s -> 2125.90s]  Okay, cucumbers between bread. Done. Fuck. I hope they're okay with it.
[2125.90s -> 2131.93s]  No, that's all the way down. Why would I eat that? How about a Kentucky hot brown? I don't know what
[2131.93s -> 2149.21s]  that is. Italian beef sandwich. Is it better than egg salad? It might be better than a, than a...
[2150.01s -> 2161.14s]  This is not roast beef. This is hot. This is, this is not cold. This is a hot sandwich. It's not cold.
[2161.70s -> 2177.22s]  Roast beef sandwich is a fucking cold. That's a cold fucker. What is this? Are these cold?
[2178.42s -> 2194.42s]  Usually it's hot. Croque monsieur. Um, never had it. Po' boys are okay, but this is kind of boring.
[2194.42s -> 2201.21s]  It's just fried shrimp between two pieces of sub roll. I'd rather just have you take it apart,
[2201.21s -> 2207.38s]  and I just want to eat the fried shrimp with like some, uh, dipping sauce. I don't want fried shrimp
[2207.38s -> 2217.70s]  between bread. I, this is kind of boring to me. Bagel with lox? That's, here's the weird part about
[2217.70s -> 2223.51s]  bagel with lox. I was just going to put it up here to pretend that, like, to be sophisticated.
[2223.51s -> 2228.87s]  I've eaten it plenty of times, but I was, oh yeah, of course, bagel with lox. I'm sophisticated. I'm
[2228.87s -> 2235.94s]  like cool and smart, but like, it actually is probably down here. Like, if I want to pretend
[2235.94s -> 2240.28s]  to you guys, I'm like, wow, look at, I'm like, look at how, how, look at my food eating habits.
[2240.28s -> 2244.92s]  I eat like salmon lox on bagels. Who cares? Like, doesn't matter. Yeah, it's down here.
[2244.92s -> 2256.55s]  Just be pretending to be, like, sophisticated when I'm not. Liverwurst, F. Veggie and hummus, F.
[2256.55s -> 2264.66s]  Oh, okay, veggie and hummus is just BLT. It's different, some other way, made a different way.
[2264.66s -> 2281.83s]  Veggie and hummus, this is, this is like the Mediterranean BLT. What was this? Bocadillo.
[2283.22s -> 2297.50s]  Is it bread rub with butter? I've never had it. Okay, let me, let me get this right. What is the
[2297.50s -> 2313.42s]  best sandwich on earth? I gotta be, like, dressed for this. I'm hungry right now. I'm very hungry
[2313.42s -> 2322.10s]  right now, so this is important. This is the best time to take this quiz. If you presented all these
[2322.10s -> 2326.15s]  in front of me right now and you said, Jeremy, pick between fucking any of these. You can have
[2326.15s -> 2336.73s]  any of one of them right now. And the, oh, and all the other ones disappear. Let's get that right,
[2336.73s -> 2356.71s]  right off the bat. Oh, feeling like fucking Reuben tonight. Oh, wait a minute, this is
[2356.71s -> 2364.78s]  patty melt. Sounds pretty good too. Oh, meatball sub. Actually, fuck, meatball sub has to go down
[2364.78s -> 2370.26s]  a full two letter grades. Because this is just the thing that's at school lunch every day.
[2372.15s -> 2389.58s]  It sucks. But I love meatballs. I love meatball subs. Ah, French dip comes up.
[2390.38s -> 2395.18s]  Patty melt. Thanksgiving sandwich is about to get knocked out. No, it can't. It's like my favorite.
[2395.98s -> 2401.58s]  It's my favorite. But if I was presented with all these right now and it just assigned my fucking
[2401.58s -> 2405.90s]  soul away to eat one of these right now, which one would it be? It wouldn't be, it wouldn't be,
[2406.62s -> 2413.83s]  it wouldn't be agiro. It wouldn't be tuna melt. That's too simple.
[2436.26s -> 2454.65s]  Hmm. French dip is creeping. Oh shit. It's pulled pork is on the move. Pulled pork is on the move.
[2454.65s -> 2477.13s]  Fuck. Fuck. Oh, I didn't got to knock him down. You got to knock some down. You have to. I don't
[2477.13s -> 2486.42s]  think it's going to be harder if I don't Reuben with fresh, fresh fucking like, oh,
[2487.88s -> 2494.94s]  sauerkraut. And with that fresh like corned beef, just like shredded up and just placed over like,
[2494.94s -> 2501.26s]  oh, with tender and just bite into it. You get that the hint of the sourness from the sauerkraut.
[2501.26s -> 2506.46s]  You get that Dijon must what's on it. Russian dressing. It's like my favorite sandwich. I don't
[2506.46s -> 2524.17s]  fucking know what's on it. I love Reuben's. No, but that's so basic. It's so easy to love a
[2524.17s -> 2531.69s]  cheesesteak. Everybody does. Is it weird that I don't think you're okay. If you don't like
[2531.69s -> 2542.84s]  cheesesteak, there's something wrong with you, right? If you eat meat, right? If you're vegetarian
[2542.84s -> 2548.68s]  or vegan, whatever, you're not going to eat these. But if you eat meat and you don't love cheesesteak,
[2548.68s -> 2562.92s]  I don't even know how it's possible. I've never met anybody in my life that ate meat
[2563.48s -> 2573.99s]  and had a cheesesteak and went, oh, no, thank you. That is awful. Yuck. Who's ever done that?
[2573.99s -> 2580.90s]  What if you're lactose intolerant? No, but I mean like if you are of the body of people that can
[2580.90s -> 2585.30s]  eat these sandwiches, if you can, if you're not lactose intolerant, you're not vegetarian,
[2585.30s -> 2590.58s]  you're not vegan, you eat meat, you eat beef. If you, all those things, if you do that and you
[2590.58s -> 2610.95s]  don't like a cheesesteak, who are you? From a cheese's garbage. What? I have digestive problems
[2610.95s -> 2625.13s]  and I still eat the fuck out of cheese. Don't eat a lot of it, but hold on. I know cheese is like a
[2625.13s -> 2631.85s]  meme. Like, oh my God, cover it with cheese. The ooey gooey cheesy. Oh yeah. Oh my God. Does it
[2631.85s -> 2641.48s]  have like a bunch of fucking nacho cheese on it? Oh, I know. I get it, but it's still good. Oh,
[2641.48s -> 2648.54s]  how can we make a, how can we make like a Caesar salad better? Cover it with ooey gooey yummy,
[2648.54s -> 2654.49s]  cheesy, cheesy, cheesy. I know people like that. And it's like, okay, we're like, that's funny.
[2655.21s -> 2677.30s]  Cheese, put cheese on everything. Stop, please. Please don't talk like this. No, this is, this is
[2677.30s -> 2693.38s]  fine the way it is. Now we gotta go to A. Chicken gyro. I love them. Chicken salad. Egg salad. Get
[2693.38s -> 2698.89s]  up there. Especially with a little bit of mustard. And if I want to make this even better, I could
[2698.89s -> 2712.39s]  put some ooey. Tortoise is better than grilled cheese. It is. Two in a mouth is better than
[2712.39s -> 2718.70s]  Italian beef. It is. I'm sorry. It's really easy to make too. These kind of are both the same in my
[2718.70s -> 2723.40s]  brain. If you want cold version, you know, if you want, if you're feeling like a cold sandwich,
[2723.40s -> 2731.08s]  chicken salad, hot tuna melt. Do that a sub notification with that. Oh, you know how we
[2731.08s -> 2745.74s]  could make this sub so much better? With a ton of, no, people would hate me. Grilled cheese is good,
[2745.74s -> 2753.48s]  but a grilled cheese with tuna in it is better. All right, enough with the pretending. I don't
[2753.48s -> 2761.13s]  actually like this that much. Cologne and cheese, it's just a childhood favorite. It has to be up
[2761.13s -> 2775.91s]  there. Lobster roll is 1000% way too low. What the hell was I doing? Yeah, what the fuck is wrong
[2775.91s -> 2790.38s]  with me? Lobster roll is better than Italian beef. I think it's good there. I think it's good there.
[2791.02s -> 2810.62s]  Get out of here. Okay. Okay. Ooey gooey. All right. Ham and cheese, turkey club, PB&J,
[2810.62s -> 2817.83s]  falafel pita, po'boy. I think this is fine. Ham and cheese probably comes up. BLT goes to the bottom.
[2817.83s -> 2831.91s]  Caprice comes up. This goes to the bottom. This goes to the bottom. Edgy and a hummus. Oh, these,
[2831.91s -> 2839.96s]  no, that goes, oh, yeah. I think that's a little bit worse. No, I don't really know what these
[2839.96s -> 2847.67s]  other ones are, but I'm going to stay sure. All right. Ham and cheese, better than a, no,
[2847.67s -> 2852.15s]  I'd rather have a po'boy than just a ham and cheese. Imagine going to a restaurant. What do
[2852.15s -> 2857.83s]  you have on the menu? Well, on our sandwich list, we have a po'boy with a horse radish mayo on it
[2857.83s -> 2862.47s]  and a little bit of a cucumber slice down the middle and butterflied over there with a little
[2862.47s -> 2868.47s]  bit of aioli on top. We also have a ham and cheese sandwich. It's just ham, cheese, and lettuce with
[2868.47s -> 2880.07s]  just a bun that you get at the grocery store. Get out of here. Why is cucumber above roast beef?
[2880.07s -> 2884.92s]  Because I think roast, I think cold roast beef sucks, but you're right. This should be at the
[2884.92s -> 2901.61s]  bottom. Why is bologna so high? I like bologna. Fringe. Germa is artificially inflating the price
[2901.61s -> 2908.94s]  of, what am I doing? Reubens. Stop watching the stream. Reubens are fan-fucking-tastic, man. I
[2908.94s -> 2915.59s]  might have to get one today. Why is PB&J so low? Because I would prefer if it was peanut butter
[2915.59s -> 2926.74s]  and fluff, marshmallow fluff. PB&J, I don't want it. I want marshmallow fluff instead. That's a
[2926.74s -> 2945.29s]  stupid reason. But is it though? I would rather have a turkey club than a PB&J. Fluff fucking sucks.
[2945.29s -> 2964.70s]  You've never had it, then. It's just this ooey gooey sweet. Am I trying to get you guys to not
[2964.70s -> 2970.17s]  like me? I think about some of the things that I say in the stream and I think back later, I'm like,
[2970.17s -> 2977.13s]  am I trying to make everybody hate me? Is that what I'm doing? Is that the goal of the stream
[2977.13s -> 2984.10s]  recently? Hey, what can I say that people are gonna hit the X wicked fucking fast? Oh, I know.
[2984.10s -> 2992.07s]  This ooey gooey thing that everyone fucking hates. All right, by the way, it's like a million degrees
[2992.07s -> 2997.56s]  in here and I have a full robe on. I'm gonna die. All right, anymore? You got any more lists
[2997.56s -> 3007.13s]  before I end this stream? I've done cheeses before. Jurassic Park dinosaurs? Oh, fuck yeah.
[3007.13s -> 3024.70s]  All right, we're gonna do Jurassic Park dinosaurs. I'm gonna save this. Control C saves, right? And
[3024.70s -> 3033.78s]  then it's Control V to paste. I'm getting the hang of things. Can we see the community rank?
[3033.78s -> 3045.42s]  Uh, view, yeah, all right, view community rank. And add. Uh, this is the community rank. Fried
[3045.42s -> 3060.33s]  chicken, grilled cheese. Where's Reuben? That's way too fucking low. That's way too low. Where's
[3060.33s -> 3082.82s]  roast beef? What? No. Roast beef better than a lobster roll? Okay, we're gonna do one more.
[3082.82s -> 3088.58s]  We're gonna do Jurassic Park dinosaur list of like my favorite dinosaurs. You guys ready?
[3088.58s -> 3099.34s]  What image is this? Do faces updated. I've already, I'm not doing a tier list of my own face.
[3099.34s -> 3118.30s]  That's just, that's so megalomaniac. Did that work? Jurassic Park dinosaurs. Do it. Do it. Do it. Oh
[3118.30s -> 3129.88s]  my fucking god. Fine. I'll do it. I'll do it. Where'd your link go? I'm not gonna do human organs.
[3129.88s -> 3141.29s]  Link it to me. Link me. All right, this is one, I'll do this one right now. This one's apparently
[3141.29s -> 3154.39s]  updated. German faces updated. So what, what am I, how am I ranking these based on
[3156.17s -> 3168.65s]  how ugly they are? Or how, or just what they look like? Or how much I like them? Just rank them.
[3168.65s -> 3180.04s]  Okay, that's F. This is A. This is a Pog. It has to be high. Uh, this is, that reminds me of the German
[3180.04s -> 3188.74s]  Rumble, so it goes up there. This reminds me of the carnival, so it, it's not that high. It should
[3188.74s -> 3205.26s]  be high A. This is what, I fucking hate this one too. I like this one. This is, I, look at,
[3205.26s -> 3211.14s]  look at how handsome I was when I was a young man. What could it be? That's just a Photoshop. It's
[3211.14s -> 3223.74s]  not, it's, all right. What about the ones that are just Photoshop? They're not even my face. Delete
[3223.74s -> 3229.96s]  that image off the internet. I fucking hate that image. This is just me looking, oh, that's fat me.
[3229.96s -> 3242.78s]  Okay. This one's fucking stupid. All right, I like this one. This one's going up to like A. This one's
[3242.78s -> 3278.54s]  probably A. This looks like, I, this is like the Roblox face. Like you made me in Roblox. There's
[3278.54s -> 3296.81s]  a lot of shitty, oh wow, yeah, that's up here. This is, okay, I thought this is a screen grab from
[3296.81s -> 3308.25s]  this stream. I was like, what the hell? This is, they are, these are screen grabs from this stream.
[3308.25s -> 3350.02s]  These don't even faces. You just took the, all right, hold on. I'm fixing the list. Hold on.
[3350.02s -> 3375.30s]  This is a picture of me in fucking high school. Who cares? Bottom. Oh wait, no, no, no, no, no,
[3375.30s -> 3388.79s]  you're right. Yeah, this goes up here. Wait, now we're going to close this out with Jurassic Park
[3388.79s -> 3406.28s]  dinosaurs. This should be easy. Pterodactyl. S. Triceratops. This is, this thing's just dead.
[3406.28s -> 3418.60s]  What is that? This is a goofy looking one. B. A. Selfie T-Rex. A. Weird little praying mantis
[3418.60s -> 3444.10s]  dinosaur. These things are cute. They get dippy. S. Spitter. A. Food. Food 2. D. T-Rex. A. Velociraptor.
[3444.10s -> 3448.50s]  What is the, what's like the Omega Dawn? Isn't that the thing from Jurassic World? What's the
[3448.50s -> 3461.58s]  thing called? Whatever it is, I'm giving it an F. What's it called? The new, they made like a
[3461.58s -> 3468.78s]  super T-Rex and it's just stupid. What was it called? He's so hungry. I'm gonna fucking try
[3468.78s -> 3480.26s]  to get a Reuben is what I'm gonna do. Taffy dinosaur. S. Brontosaurus is so cool. It's like
[3480.26s -> 3496.76s]  armadillo. Not even a dinosaur. This thing's, no, F. Is this just bones? Stegosaurus? Whale.
[3496.76s -> 3502.22s]  I don't know. I don't know. The thing's stupid. So is this. This is, I can't even tell what these
[3502.22s -> 3509.35s]  dinosaurs are. These are really shitty pictures. Wait, this is a pterodactyl with a T-Rex head.
[3509.35s -> 3518.34s]  That gets, it has to be up here. For a second I thought, I was like, why is there a human up here?
[3518.34s -> 3539.00s]  Uh, this is from The Hobbit. Mog. Food gets to be like all the way at the bottom. But I don't feel
[3539.00s -> 3543.88s]  like this is just German 985 faces. What's your favorite face? It's just the same dinosaur doing
[3543.88s -> 3566.84s]  other weird faces. Pterodactyl, the little ones, and a brontosaurus. Done. Halloween candy list.
[3566.84s -> 3575.98s]  Oh, it's ooey gooey. Don't say that. You'll get, somebody will fight you. This is me and my friends
[3575.98s -> 3597.83s]  tier list. Wait, what? Tastiest nuts? Okay, I'll do this one. Tastiest nuts. I don't want to, I don't
[3597.83s -> 3602.06s]  want to reveal it. I don't want you guys to see it too soon. Because I want to get a good look at
[3602.06s -> 3616.34s]  this first, okay. Uh, these almonds? Almonds S. These are pistachios D, C. I would put pistachios up
[3616.34s -> 3623.43s]  in B, but fuck you for being in pistachio ice cream. Seriously. If pistachio ice cream didn't
[3623.43s -> 3632.07s]  have pistachios in it, it would be so much better. It just, it angers me. I like pistachios, but when
[3632.07s -> 3636.63s]  they're in pistachio ice cream, what the fuck are they doing in there? I like the green ice cream
[3636.63s -> 3644.39s]  that pistachios ice cream sits in with whatever that is. I like that. I don't like the nuts in
[3644.39s -> 3651.32s]  there. Uh, walnuts. They kind of just, after you chew them up for too long, they get like dry and
[3651.32s -> 3661.94s]  grainy. I don't like them. Uh, what are these? Peanuts in the shell. Pretty good. Uh, macadamias.
[3661.94s -> 3674.22s]  Pretty good. Cashews F. Are these coffee beans? All right, I feel like that you, you, you, you're
[3674.22s -> 3686.92s]  duping me here and there's beans on this list. Are these chickpeas? Chickpeas are A. I don't know what
[3686.92s -> 3701.46s]  these are. These are like salted honey roasted nuts. And this is, um, a white plastic bag. Almonds
[3701.46s -> 3727.45s]  suck donkey dick. Okay. What are these? These are hazelnuts. Organs or riot? Oh my, all right, fine.
[3727.45s -> 3756.28s]  I'll do human organs. Stupid. Who, why, why does this even? Here you go. Uh, brain is A. S. Brain is S.
[3756.28s -> 3762.44s]  Otherwise, how would we have Fortnite without brain? It'd be impossible. If we didn't have brains,
[3762.44s -> 3768.89s]  there would be no, there would be no Twitch. There'd be no Fortnite. There'd be no driving
[3768.89s -> 3779.82s]  cars. There'd be no drivable cars. It's the most important organ. Without kidneys, we couldn't
[3779.82s -> 3790.54s]  drink our gamer fuel and play fucking Fortnite. And this is the dumbest tier list I think I've
[3790.54s -> 3800.66s]  ever seen. Lungs. You know, how would we be able to breathe in and rage when we get headshot from
[3800.66s -> 3806.70s]  across the map in Fortnite? If somebody builds and we're like, fuck you, how'd we be able to do that?
[3810.46s -> 3820.86s]  Without a, what the fuck is that? Without a second brain, without brain stem, we wouldn't be able to,
[3821.66s -> 3834.62s]  what is that? Without a heart. Heart, no, let's be real. What is this? The liver. Liver, I think,
[3834.62s -> 3846.22s]  would be higher up than, liver would be here. Intestines. Meh. Stomach, we need stomach to eat.
[3846.22s -> 3858.18s]  S. Uh, I don't, I don't know, is this bladder? Bladder and kidneys need to be together. Yeah,
[3858.18s -> 3873.66s]  I just made a person. This is a new organ, new organ. Pog. Imagine they discover a new organ.
[3873.66s -> 3880.26s]  This is a brand somehow. Science has discovered a new organ in the human body. Like, they never knew
[3880.26s -> 3891.35s]  it was there. They did? Well, here's the thing though. We have an appendix, but nobody knows
[3891.35s -> 3896.15s]  what the fuck it's used for. For all, seriously, for all we know, appendixes just like turn
[3897.03s -> 3901.27s]  like metal into fucking gold. How would we even know? We don't even know what it does.
[3901.83s -> 3908.65s]  They do know what it does. I thought they don't. I thought it was just a fucking thing that's there
[3908.65s -> 3918.76s]  for no reason. It was for grass and leaves and for turning metal into gold coins. We know what
[3918.76s -> 3932.79s]  appendixes are for now. It's there to explode. It's just, that's what it does. There's an organ
[3932.87s -> 3943.53s]  in your, there's a new organ in your nose. Is there? What's it called? The snipometer?
[3943.53s -> 3954.25s]  Nose two. Gooey gooey. All right, I'm fucking out of here. I'll see you tomorrow. I'll see,
[3954.25s -> 3959.32s]  me and Natalix are going to do co-op. That's the plan, unless like that goes all fucking wrong. I
[3959.32s -> 3966.52s]  gotta, my computer needs some serious work. Well, that was fun. I actually did have kind of fun
[3966.52s -> 3974.14s]  playing Watch Dogs while we, you know, we had, we were just chilling, talking. I'll see you tomorrow.
[3974.22s -> 3981.19s]  Round, actually, you know what? Tomorrow, I think starting around 4 p.m. Pacific.
[3981.19s -> 3986.41s]  Co-oping with somebody. Gotta, we gotta move some times around. I think we'll get burpee today,
[3986.41s -> 3994.38s]  too. What the fuck? So I'll see you tomorrow. Somewhere around 4 p.m. Pacific time. And then
[3994.38s -> 4001.46s]  on Halloween night, gonna be playing some more scary VR games. Got some fun stuff going on.
[4001.46s -> 4006.47s]  So that was Watch Dogs. And we can all just pretend that that, we can just burn that out of our brain
[4006.47s -> 4013.06s]  for a little while. Uh, here come the subs that subbed this stream. There were a lot of, there
[4013.06s -> 4018.66s]  were a lot of community subs. There's a lot of money today, too. We got raided by Ludwig, who,
[4018.66s -> 4025.56s]  I mean that was a huge raid. It was 15,000 people. If you stuck around from Ludwig,
[4025.56s -> 4050.60s]  thanks a lot. He's a really good dude. I would, I would follow that boy. Play Five Nights at
[4050.60s -> 4062.74s]  Bugleberry's. But yeah, we had a lot, there was like five $50 donations in bits today. And then
[4062.74s -> 4066.74s]  there was a hundred dollar, there was like three or four hundred bucks in bits today, so thanks guys.
[4066.74s -> 4075.16s]  That's a lot of fucking money to be giving somebody on the internet. You're not explaining
[4075.16s -> 4084.26s]  the cashews. Uh, they're the meat of the nut family. And I don't like it. Hey, Ludwig subbed!
[4084.26s -> 4093.21s]  I just saw it. They're the meat of the nut family. They're very earthy, very meaty. They get a very
[4093.21s -> 4115.27s]  deep flavor. Layers of Fear 2? I, hey, hold on, I have a question. Is Layers of, I heard Layers of
[4115.27s -> 4137.08s]  Fear 2 wasn't that good. It is? I heard it was like kind of not as good as the first one. Play it,
[4137.08s -> 4142.38s]  play it, play it. Both are bad. I thought Layers of Fear 1 was pretty good. I mean, we got some,
[4142.38s -> 4148.41s]  we got one of the most iconic video clips of the whole stream ever. I can't believe that was like
[4148.41s -> 4157.13s]  in my first, wasn't that like in the first few months that I even started streaming on Twitch?
[4157.13s -> 4181.10s]  It was. He peaked at his fucking debut. I did not peak at my debut. We haven't peaked yet. Don't
[4181.10s -> 4191.11s]  worry. You'll know when we peak because it might happen in 2021. Everything that I planned on doing
[4191.11s -> 4199.80s]  in 2020 had to get pushed to 2021. So 2021 is going to be loaded with something crazy every
[4199.80s -> 4203.80s]  probably two or three months because it just has to be because it's been, everything's been dumped
[4203.80s -> 4223.43s]  and delayed. Why do I have a fucking headache now? I have this like wicked bad headache right now
[4223.43s -> 4231.69s]  from, what is it from? From Watch Dogs? Did I get my brain hacked? All right, I'll see you guys
[4231.69s -> 4242.44s]  tomorrow. Have a wonderful rest of your night. Take care guys. See you tomorrow and good night.
