[2.17s -> 8.67s]  So here he is, the man of the hour, the medic. If you haven't seen Meet the Medic already, go see it right now. It's amazing.
[8.67s -> 16.67s]  The new needle gun is the overdose. 10% less damage done, but your movement speed increases based on the amount of ubercharge you have.
[16.67s -> 23.91s]  The new medigun is the quick fix. Everyone already knew what this was. It was in beta, just like the detonator.
[23.91s -> 27.91s]  Faster heal rate, faster ubercharge rate, but you can't overheal anybody.
[28.41s -> 33.41s]  And your ubercharge is a 300% faster heal and immunity to movement impairing effects.
[33.41s -> 37.41s]  And this thing, I had to buy this. It just lets you see enemy health.
[37.41s -> 42.90s]  By the way, sets do absolutely nothing. As you can see, I have the full set of this.
[42.90s -> 51.90s]  So, the quick fix is kind of an odd duck. I think it's weird because it takes everything you've known about the medic and it flips it upside down.
[51.90s -> 56.90s]  See, right here I'm healing a bunch of people over and over again and running around, trying to overheal people.
[57.40s -> 65.40s]  It's just kind of a habit that you have as a medic. You have to lose that when you have the quick fix because you don't have to do this.
[65.40s -> 68.40s]  The only reason why you do this in the beginning, of course, is to build up an uber.
[68.40s -> 72.40s]  But it's completely unnecessary in any other situation.
[72.40s -> 80.40s]  I think the actual ubercharge on this thing, it's just kind of odd. It's trying to be like three or four different things.
[80.90s -> 86.90s]  You know, with the knockback immunity, the extra heal rate, and I don't know, I just feel like it's trying to be too many things.
[86.90s -> 96.90s]  If they just got rid of the uber completely and made it, instead of 40%, like 60% better heal, I bet you people would still use it and still love it.
[96.90s -> 101.90s]  So, speaking of the uber of this gun, why don't we take a look and see what it does?
[101.90s -> 107.90s]  I actually kind of freak out here. I don't really do it so well. I get kind of lost in what I'm doing.
[108.40s -> 112.40s]  I keep thinking it's going to be like an ubercharge, but like I said, it's just not.
[112.40s -> 116.40s]  The heal rate is great, though. As you can tell, I just popped it. It's hard to tell if you popped it or not.
[116.40s -> 119.40s]  It looks kind of like the Amputator taunt.
[119.40s -> 126.40s]  And that was it. You just saw it. It was faster heal rate for 10 seconds.
[126.40s -> 128.40s]  I don't know.
[128.40s -> 131.40s]  The actual heal rate on this thing is amazing.
[131.90s -> 137.90s]  As you can see, that scout was at zero health and I brought him all the way up to full in less than pretty much a second.
[137.90s -> 143.90s]  So the actual heal rate is great. Like I said, the uber is just nothing to me. I'm not a big fan of it.
[143.90s -> 148.90s]  I probably have to give it some more time. That's probably the problem that I'm having.
[148.90s -> 153.90s]  But, see right here, the soldier just had no health and now he's at full.
[154.40s -> 161.40s]  It's just, it's an incredible, it's a good, I want to say raid healer, if anyone knows what I'm talking about when I say raid healer.
[161.40s -> 167.40s]  That'll throw back to some World of Warcraft players or some LoTRO players or whoever you are.
[167.40s -> 170.40s]  It's a raid healing gun. Let's put it that way.
[171.77s -> 177.77s]  Where this thing actually excels is in situations like this, where you have to outheal damage.
[177.77s -> 181.77s]  See, this soldier probably would have just died right here if it wasn't for the quick fix.
[182.27s -> 187.27s]  The crit screak and the regular medic gun would have definitely failed in that situation.
[187.27s -> 194.27s]  So, the other items. First of all, I thought the new melee unlockable for the medic was a hat.
[194.27s -> 201.27s]  And I was psyched about it. I was like, oh my god, that's an awesome, I hope that's a miscellaneous, that would be so funny.
[201.27s -> 208.27s]  But it turns out it's a melee weapon and with identical stats as the default bone saw.
[208.77s -> 213.77s]  But you get to see player's health, enemy's health, and that's a huge bonus.
[213.77s -> 220.77s]  But I don't know if I'm willing to give up some of the other saws, like the uber saw or the amputator, they're just so good.
[220.77s -> 223.77s]  It's going to take a little more time using them to find that out.
[224.77s -> 231.95s]  The sniper got a couple of items in this update. Most notably the Bazar Bargain, the new sniper rifle.
[232.45s -> 239.45s]  Base charge rate is decreased by 20%. Each scoped headshot decreases the weapon's charge time by I think it's 10%.
[239.45s -> 245.45s]  A scoped body shot or a missed shot wipes the charge. No new secondary for the sniper this time.
[245.45s -> 254.45s]  But a new knife, the shashahashashashasha, which essentially is just the equalizer without the speed increase.
[254.45s -> 258.69s]  So this is what it looks like just at base level. I haven't shot anybody yet.
[259.19s -> 262.19s]  And see there's a little indicator on the lower right that says heads.
[262.19s -> 266.19s]  Sort of like the Demoman's Eyelander or the Clyde & Moore.
[266.19s -> 270.19s]  But here's one headshot here and there's another one I believe right here.
[270.19s -> 275.19s]  So this is what it looks like with two and it looks pretty normal, maybe a little bit higher.
[275.19s -> 279.19s]  It looks about the same as it would be with the regular sniper rifle.
[279.19s -> 286.19s]  To consistently do well with this sniper rifle you have to know what you're doing as a sniper.
[286.19s -> 291.69s]  They came out with a Sydney Sleeper for the people that couldn't really aim too well.
[291.69s -> 295.69s]  And then they came out with this which was the pro sniper rifle.
[295.69s -> 301.69s]  So I'm a very bad sniper so I think I only get a maximum, I think I get three.
[301.69s -> 309.69s]  So yeah, I can't really demonstrate this too well because I only get three headshots so we'll see what it looks like after three.
[310.19s -> 316.19s]  I'm pretty sure the max is probably seven or eight. I'm wondering what the max is for the Eyelander.
[316.19s -> 323.19s]  So as you can see it is pretty much, right there it looks like it's the same as the Sydney Sleeper is now after the buff.
[323.19s -> 329.19s]  So I'm guessing after four or five headshots in a row you will really start to see this thing shine.
[329.19s -> 332.19s]  These are just a couple of kills with the new knife.
[332.19s -> 338.19s]  The new knife like I said is the equalizer which means that you do more damage when you take more damage.
[338.19s -> 342.69s]  I think it's when you get to half health you do like 25% more damage or something like that.
[342.69s -> 347.69s]  And we end with the Spy. The Spy got two new items in this update.
[347.69s -> 351.69s]  The first that he got is a new revolver, it's called the Enforcer.
[351.69s -> 359.69s]  20% damage done over the regular revolver and a half a second increase in cloak time which we'll talk about in a second.
[359.69s -> 365.69s]  He got a new knife, the Big Earner, plus 30 cloak on kill, I'm not sure if that means backstab or not.
[366.19s -> 370.19s]  And 25 less health on wear so you have 100 health as the Spy.
[370.19s -> 373.49s]  So let's go over the Enforcer, it is the new revolver.
[373.49s -> 382.49s]  It's 20% more damage and it is a straight upgrade, that's right it's a straight upgrade to the regular revolver if you use the Dead Ringer.
[382.49s -> 387.49s]  I say that because the Dead Ringer is not affected by the decrease in cloak time.
[387.49s -> 393.99s]  Only the regular invisibility watch and the cloak and dagger are affected by the decrease in cloak time.
[393.99s -> 395.99s]  So let's talk about the knife now.
[395.99s -> 399.99s]  Take a look at my cloak in the lower right and watch this, bang.
[399.99s -> 404.99s]  This knife is also another one of those straight upgrades over the original.
[404.99s -> 409.99s]  Mainly because the downside is really not that bad.
[409.99s -> 417.99s]  You only are taking a 25 health hit, I mean the Kunai is a 65 health hit so you're not losing that much health at all.
[417.99s -> 423.99s]  So for the purposes of showing you the downside of the revolver I'm going to use the regular cloak.
[423.99s -> 429.99s]  So you'll see here, I come out here and I get a kill, watch my cloak bar, it's going to fill right up.
[429.99s -> 437.99s]  And then watch this, that right there, that little half second right there is going to throw you off so bad.
[437.99s -> 440.99s]  I highly recommend using the Dead Ringer with this set.
[440.99s -> 446.99s]  Not really the knife but definitely, definitely the revolver portion of the set.
[446.99s -> 453.42s]  And that is all I have for you guys. I'm sorry that I had to split it up into two videos.
[453.42s -> 457.42s]  But you don't know how horrible this was to make.
[457.42s -> 460.42s]  It took a long time. I hope you guys appreciate it.
[460.42s -> 464.42s]  I hope somebody gets something out of it because I did.
[464.42s -> 474.42s]  I did. I learned how to tear my hair out of my skull because item servers weren't working and oh my god, I don't even get me started.
[474.42s -> 479.42s]  But yeah, like, comment, subscribe, do whatever you guys want to do.
[479.42s -> 486.42s]  I hope you guys enjoy the new items and I'm glad I could bring at least some information to somebody who is on the fence about something.
[486.42s -> 491.42s]  So thanks again, take care guys, I'll see you next time.
