[1.08s -> 29.89s]  So, this is RID Asteroid, and as you can see here, we've got plenty of different classes
[29.89s -> 35.89s]  to choose from. We've got plenty of demo men, we've got a lot of soldiers, we've got a lot of heavies.
[35.89s -> 39.89s]  There's not just scouts and engineers, there's way more.
[39.89s -> 46.74s]  What are we doing? We need to be killing the robots.
[46.74s -> 52.79s]  Don't pan the engineer. That's not what we should be doing.
[52.79s -> 58.16s]  Look, we have to go get the... Oh, there's an engineer over here.
[58.16s -> 65.34s]  Oh, great. Okay. These two centuries are so close to each other, I'm surprised that they're not going to be shooting at each other.
[65.34s -> 71.03s]  I got auto-balanced.
[93.14s -> 96.38s]  Hopefully, we will soon see the outcome.
[96.38s -> 101.60s]  Don't forget your bonk. Don't forget your bonk. Don't forget your bonk.
[101.60s -> 107.72s]  Oh, it's closing. The door is closing. No!
[107.72s -> 109.72s]  I wanted to get in there.
[109.72s -> 114.16s]  Don't you laugh at me.
[114.16s -> 121.22s]  Oh, shit. Oh, God. This guy. No.
[121.22s -> 131.80s]  Oh, what? How am I dominating somebody?
[131.80s -> 135.42s]  Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. One second.
[135.42s -> 138.73s]  Give one second here.
[138.73s -> 141.73s]  What the flying fuck is going on right here?
[141.73s -> 148.09s]  What is this?
[148.09s -> 150.09s]  This guy's behind the glass.
[150.09s -> 154.10s]  Too many centuries versus a big... All right, here we go.
[154.10s -> 158.34s]  This is the real test of what's a better century.
[158.34s -> 160.34s]  Who's like the better engineer?
[160.34s -> 169.14s]  Two big centuries versus two minis blocked by glass.
[169.14s -> 173.41s]  Oh, my God.
[176.44s -> 184.49s]  Oh, boy.
[184.49s -> 187.11s]  What have we got? What have we got? What have we got?
[187.11s -> 190.86s]  Oh, look, a spy. I'm going to go steal your R2-D2.
[190.86s -> 193.23s]  You can try.
[193.23s -> 195.23s]  Stealth, are you on the other team?
[195.23s -> 198.61s]  I'm on blue.
[198.61s -> 200.61s]  Oh, well, I'm just making my way through.
[200.61s -> 203.55s]  Okay, I'm joining red. I'm on red.
[203.55s -> 206.50s]  Just sneak by here. Go by the hole. Anybody?
[206.50s -> 209.50s]  Oh, look, a soldier. You might be AFK. Oh, no, you're not.
[209.50s -> 214.26s]  He was an AFK when I shot him.
[214.26s -> 216.88s]  Oh, now I'm at their R2-D2s.
[216.88s -> 219.12s]  I can't do it. I can't.
[219.12s -> 221.12s]  I just can't shoot R2-D2.
[221.12s -> 224.26s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.
[224.26s -> 226.26s]  I'm going to get the intelligence.
[226.26s -> 228.82s]  Come on. Come on.
[228.82s -> 231.50s]  Oh, my God.
[231.50s -> 233.50s]  Tom Hanks. I mean, Tom Cruise.
[233.50s -> 239.20s]  What are we going to do? We need to play his bets here.
[239.20s -> 242.20s]  Who is going to, like, actually not make it through this, do you think?
[242.20s -> 244.70s]  Oh, this thing is simple.
[248.60s -> 254.26s]  Oh, this thing is simple, huh?
[254.26s -> 256.26s]  Okay, now can you accept this?
[256.26s -> 259.39s]  What am I doing?
[259.39s -> 262.59s]  Can you accept that backflip?
[262.59s -> 264.59s]  I need to step back a little bit.
[264.59s -> 268.02s]  It would be really funny if you could get killed by that.
[268.02s -> 271.03s]  Whoa, that's going to be close.
[271.03s -> 276.01s]  All right, right here.
[276.01s -> 278.01s]  What the fuck just happened?
[278.01s -> 281.01s]  I definitely got killed by the laser.
[295.11s -> 298.29s]  Oh, this is so stupid.
[298.29s -> 304.47s]  I hope everybody makes it through.
[304.47s -> 311.79s]  So come to where, like, everybody is on a...
[311.79s -> 314.22s]  For, like, blue?
[314.22s -> 316.40s]  On, like, where we are.
[316.40s -> 318.90s]  Okay, on red?
[318.90s -> 322.86s]  All right, let me come to the front door.
[322.86s -> 331.12s]  I'm going to make this guy do a backflip.
[331.12s -> 334.42s]  And once, after, right when he's done...
[334.42s -> 345.96s]  Why did it take that guy that long to decide to do that?
[345.96s -> 351.14s]  Everyone's just kind of standing around.
[352.14s -> 356.98s]  There's, like, no objective for us to do right now.
[356.98s -> 359.29s]  Besides just, like, standing around.
[359.29s -> 361.29s]  There's one, two, three, four, five.
[361.29s -> 363.72s]  There's six people on our team, seven people.
[363.72s -> 367.94s]  Just chilling out right here.
[367.94s -> 370.31s]  Maybe we'll steal more points.
[370.31s -> 372.31s]  You got it. Congratulations.
[372.31s -> 376.52s]  Oh, shit, a player.
[376.52s -> 378.95s]  A guy on blue team. Look out.
[378.95s -> 380.95s]  Don't worry, there was only one of them.
[380.95s -> 382.95s]  There's ten people on their team.
[382.95s -> 385.77s]  We did it.
