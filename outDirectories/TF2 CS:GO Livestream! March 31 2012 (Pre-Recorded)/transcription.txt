[187.70s -> 193.76s]  I've not seen the hunger games. Is it any good? And if the answer is yes, I would probably see it
[193.76s -> 199.25s]  It's about as good as the TV show community as good as it gets

[253.38s -> 255.14s]  Oh burger boy
[255.14s -> 259.58s]  There's this page one so you can go over page one while I do Twitter and then I'll do page two in a second
[259.58s -> 278.19s]  I got backstabbed don't get backstabbed. All righty. All right, we go to page two page two
[278.19s -> 283.00s]  That's the page two even though you can't see. Oh, it's show. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Sorry
[284.22s -> 288.18s]  So I go back to page one so you can see the colors and this whole thing is being given away
[288.34s -> 321.61s]  So hopefully you're one of the winners. Oh, no page two. I got a lot of strangers a lot of strangers page three
[321.61s -> 330.17s]  Hey, you're heck you're heck. Yeah
[331.41s -> 339.68s]  Page four. I love how burger boys using the
[340.12s -> 345.32s]  Logger now and you're gonna have to deal with it now, aren't you? No, I don't know. He's on my team
[345.32s -> 356.34s]  Oh, I'm like medic on him one more page after this. Does any of them stick you to the wall?
[356.34s -> 364.45s]  I don't think it does. I think only the is my character was like standing up after I get killed and then page six
[364.49s -> 371.51s]  There you go. This is probably like the best page with all of my actual hats that I like love
[372.51s -> 384.05s]  And all the strangers are of course are over here and you get the idea. Do you do you do?
[384.89s -> 388.21s]  All right, let's do it. Let's do a high five and let's get this wrong
[388.33s -> 397.19s]  Yeah, I items that I cannot give away. I've not I won't be able to get away
[397.19s -> 402.13s]  So I can't give away the cheaters lament. I can't give away. I think there's a couple other things
[402.13s -> 413.24s]  You can't give either. There's like two or three items. I know for sure. I cannot give I'll be ginger
[413.24s -> 426.08s]  Let's turn this down. It's just a tick just a tick. Well, where's my Gerardi? I don't have the Gerardi. Oh
[428.95s -> 432.65s]  Shrek. Oh
[432.65s -> 435.85s]  Okay, not again. Oh
[440.14s -> 448.04s]  Watch it watch it watch it around this corner here mini century. Get out of here. Oh, how did I not get him?
[449.28s -> 456.05s]  You a spy you kind of acted like one. Oh look MLC stealth just killed stealth
[458.96s -> 463.07s]  When do I think I'll hit 25,000
[464.63s -> 471.77s]  Probably a couple weeks, maybe maybe a week. I don't know. It's gonna happen sooner rather than later
[471.77s -> 485.62s]  I probably will say that I don't know though. I have no idea follow me Jack
[485.62s -> 498.51s]  Oh you ran into it whoo-hoo-hoo. That was pretty nice, but don't say so myself. I just got like fished
[498.51s -> 508.38s]  I got fish killed. I'm screaming. This is boo. This is boo man 61 and MLC stealth boo and stealth. Hello
[508.90s -> 520.56s]  Hello, but those of you wondering I was kicked by console. That's not cool. You got kicked
[520.56s -> 526.32s]  No, no, no, like someone's saying they were kicked like for what what'd you do? Nothing problem. That's about your B
[526.32s -> 531.32s]  It's it's changing. Love it. Yeah, it sounded like you were talking to your like dog. Like what did you do?
[531.32s -> 534.13s]  What did you do auto?
[539.27s -> 541.64s]  Nucleus, huh? Nucleus
[541.84s -> 543.22s]  Nucleus
[543.22s -> 552.16s]  Nucleus direct it. I'll try it and the conqueror. Why am I using that the contrar?
[554.47s -> 560.68s]  It's CH. It's like church. Do you know how to pronounce things snipers? I'm scared
[560.72s -> 568.76s]  Oh, do you remember yesterday? I was saying about how hard is the headshot soldiers that there's like four soldiers on the other side
[568.76s -> 570.76s]  I just can't headshot one
[571.83s -> 576.14s]  Actually, I recognize that beard any day. Come here German. Well, what's that?
[577.02s -> 581.30s]  Nevermind boo. Why you know post-modern warfare 3 that's what she said
[581.30s -> 584.12s]  Oh, it's cuz I really don't like the game anymore
[584.12s -> 590.14s]  I might not be totally dumb and I'm weighing it about in my head because I've got some old recorded gameplay
[590.14s -> 601.56s]  I just never used I might make a few more bids out of it pyro direct hit. Oh
[602.28s -> 616.42s]  Come on, come on come out of that watch out for the crits people everywhere like all over it
[619.06s -> 626.31s]  No, no soldier, I'm gonna go I'm gonna go pyro with this setup cuz I like it
[633.27s -> 653.07s]  No, no, let's go. Oh, no, come here do it again. No, I missed it. I missed it. I missed it. Oh, no
[654.45s -> 666.12s]  No, I gotta turn the volume up a little bit. Can you guys can you guys hear the uh in-game volume?
[666.12s -> 678.47s]  Okay, where's it too low? Let me know. Oh, no, I can't we have to play speaking of playing
[678.47s -> 681.09s]  I gotta start like actually playing. Oh
[685.48s -> 688.16s]  No, I missed. Oh, no
[689.56s -> 707.58s]  Get him off the point. Oh, no, the only one on here. I'm screwed. We're gonna get it. That's a spy
[708.10s -> 714.41s]  Well, I'll hear a joke. Yeah, tell me a joke. Let's hear it. Give me all you got with jokes
[714.41s -> 719.59s]  I love jokes. No, I missed time that badly. Oh
[719.59s -> 722.21s]  Oh
[722.53s -> 733.98s]  You son of a bitch you rat bastard, so what way what was the joke? I'm waiting. It's probably tight
[733.98s -> 744.55s]  No, it's probably a joke. Oh, no, I just missed I gotta step my game up a little bit here
[744.59s -> 756.51s]  I'm like one in twenty five thousand. Oh, no, like I wrote stealth just like you do stuff. Mm-hmm
[756.55s -> 767.29s]  Then he backstab me. Oh, how did I not get him? Oh, get me out of there. I'm dead
[767.29s -> 771.67s]  Oh, there's no way I could have survived that can't be pyro right now. That was a lucky headshot. Holy shit
[771.67s -> 779.12s]  I'm going demo. I'm going demo demo man. Hey, what makes you a good demo man?
[779.12s -> 787.13s]  Um, a lot of things if you are good with shooting your pills, I can drink from a frying pan
[790.09s -> 797.46s]  What makes me a good demo man, oh he just felt
[799.86s -> 807.18s]  How do I not get him with that how do I not get I want to be your discussion it with you now would I
[811.99s -> 817.57s]  No, we need a medic. We all we do have a medic. We need more than one medic
[819.77s -> 823.68s]  You have two medics. I think we do. I had showing one of them
[825.68s -> 830.35s]  Once I just walked right off the map. Hey, there's a big hole in the middle of this map
[830.35s -> 834.96s]  If you didn't notice and I'm still as a joke is your mama's so fat
[835.28s -> 842.13s]  Everyone at the movie theaters thinks she's I can't really yet burger boys coming for me. Hey, it seems
[845.17s -> 852.67s]  Your mama's so fat at the movie theater. She sat next to everyone sick
[854.32s -> 857.40s]  I got one for you. Your mom is so stupid
[857.60s -> 864.17s]  She made me cookies and was a wicked nice woman and was awesome to be around at all times. There you go
[864.17s -> 865.17s]  Oh
[865.17s -> 866.45s]  Oh
[866.45s -> 874.80s]  All right. I got one too. All right. What is it? Why did the
[875.32s -> 883.78s]  King and Queen get a divorce? No, why because they had a bad night?
[887.36s -> 894.21s]  Yeah, suck both versions of the like word night. All right, boo. You're gonna do one now. Well, I've got to do a joke
[895.49s -> 897.80s]  That's why I work good Lord
[898.00s -> 903.20s]  You'll have to give me a few minutes then. Oh, come on. You have to like make it your own
[903.68s -> 910.08s]  No, the pressures are no, I've got to be honest man. I've got to deliver. Yeah. Yeah, get out of town
[910.72s -> 917.11s]  Big joke. Yeah. Good luck. Oh my god. No, I don't want that
[920.55s -> 932.89s]  No, get on the point. Yeah, I can't I can't keep my head over there. I'm just trying to log stuff in there. Come on
[935.14s -> 937.44s]  No, no, no
[937.96s -> 943.94s]  So boo, how about that joke? I can't I'm sniping him in my element
[945.86s -> 951.05s]  Sniper was walking down the street one day was he singing to a diddy diddy dum dee dee dee
[951.37s -> 958.34s]  Yeah, so he was singing that song and all of a sudden a bus came and just smashed into him
[958.34s -> 962.80s]  Oh, and that's the punchline. They will live happily ever after
[962.80s -> 974.02s]  I just got the like event for Germans and he made cycle path. Oh, really?
[974.46s -> 976.40s]  It's just starting
[976.44s -> 981.40s]  That was happens like much later than it should yeah, I sometimes said it to do that
[981.92s -> 984.72s]  Because when I usually when I'm when I first put the announcement out
[984.76s -> 987.88s]  I'm just kind of sitting there doing like nothing and shouting things out
[987.88s -> 993.42s]  So people probably just like what the hell is he doing 15 minutes in is pretty much when everything really gets going
[993.42s -> 998.72s]  I guess you stream get priority as well for the for the game, which is fair enough
[1002.44s -> 1005.40s]  Let's do one more round in here and then we're gonna go to
[1006.52s -> 1010.30s]  Different
[1016.84s -> 1027.47s]  I literally just tried holding down shift to sprint. Yeah, I've been doing that since I've been playing battle. Oh, look at how the jokes
[1027.47s -> 1034.16s]  Oh, did I save your life just barely? I think who just wait. Okay. I'm so confused right now
[1034.16s -> 1037.72s]  I just saw a stealth die in front of me by MLC still
[1038.79s -> 1048.15s]  Bye behind me, but I don't care. I'm too fast for hey, who's the real one? Oh my god. I can't hit the soldier
[1048.15s -> 1051.07s]  I'm so scared. Oh my god. Thank you for saving my life
[1053.53s -> 1061.67s]  Can I play Saxton Hale? I we tried doing that a while ago. It didn't really work out so well, though
[1061.67s -> 1064.55s]  It's we do prop hunt
[1064.55s -> 1069.75s]  Well, only because I was the only person that could get into the server and we were just spending a whole lot of time
[1070.03s -> 1076.26s]  Just watching spectating and it was kind of boring. So at least for a stream. It was kind of boring
[1076.26s -> 1081.21s]  I'd want to do that for like a video get get a bunch of people in there and make some like fun video
[1081.21s -> 1090.30s]  And I'm going to die get me out of here. They're way too many people there to be fighting right now
[1095.48s -> 1100.34s]  Come on
[1106.57s -> 1108.57s]  That other stealth guys being is like
[1109.53s -> 1118.04s]  360 I have to help it's it just the end for me might as well just do this. Oh my god. Oh my god
[1119.25s -> 1121.25s]  But I don't kill by a fit. I was you
[1121.25s -> 1125.02s]  Oh
[1125.70s -> 1128.58s]  Son of a bitch
[1129.38s -> 1133.94s]  I was in the spawn door and he shot me right in the back
[1137.76s -> 1143.58s]  Like I was like I was right like in the door and I got hit right in the back. Yeah
[1145.14s -> 1153.14s]  The red team it was a revolver too. He's not dead. We got a lot of scouts. I just heard it
[1153.14s -> 1163.93s]  I just heard him. I just heard him the soldier behind this bastard. I feel like playing pyro. I'm starting to like him more now
[1163.97s -> 1165.97s]  I was never good at pyro before
[1167.93s -> 1174.78s]  You know, I've learned to really like playing pyro playing pyro is like a ton of fun for me and I never used yeah
[1174.78s -> 1180.34s]  I I never used to like him because I always wanted to use the flare gun and when I found another pyro eyes
[1180.70s -> 1184.14s]  It's impossible
[1185.10s -> 1191.26s]  Yeah, the flare gun pretty much reinvented pyro for me like it became so much fun
[1191.30s -> 1201.40s]  What are my views on meet the pyro? I think it's gonna be epic judging by the last two
[1201.40s -> 1204.12s]  We've gotten meet the medic and meet the spy. They've been unbelievable
[1204.72s -> 1212.06s]  So one can only hope it's got to be something just as good if not better than meet the spy and meet the medic
[1212.06s -> 1223.04s]  What are they? What are those like a 2d animation thing? Yeah, that'd be interesting. It'd be interesting. It'd be cool
[1223.04s -> 1226.42s]  No, no, like it looked like it sucks
[1228.22s -> 1233.67s]  What if meet the pyro sucked? I would be disappointed. I shouldn't have shot him. Why'd I do that?
[1233.67s -> 1237.40s]  Well, at least you got my back. Anyways, I'm getting destroyed
[1237.44s -> 1243.87s]  Passage meet the pyro was like stick figures and like the music was a MIDI file like
[1245.87s -> 1252.91s]  What if what if the pyro was a stick figure Wow, you just blew my mind right there what?
[1254.62s -> 1258.94s]  You just totally blew like he takes off his his mask and it's literally just a stick figure
[1260.55s -> 1262.55s]  It's like a broom like in Family Guy
[1270.92s -> 1277.69s]  Yeah, they're probably not gonna take his mask off I bet you hit the hill take his mask off
[1277.85s -> 1285.89s]  You're saying why are you saying well hurt him or her the pyro will probably take off the mask right when the ending happens
[1285.89s -> 1287.89s]  Like oh, here I go. Like you're it
[1288.69s -> 1294.83s]  It'll probably be something like that. What if it'll be Gabe Newell's troll face? What if it was just Gabe Newell's face?
[1294.83s -> 1301.20s]  It's just Gabe Newell's face is him like he made the character like after himself
[1301.20s -> 1309.23s]  I cannot hit this scout to save my life. Can't hit anybody to save my life for real. Jeez
[1310.98s -> 1314.86s]  I mean all jokes aside the pyro is clearly just gonna be Zoe
[1316.58s -> 1324.16s]  Clearly stick the scout and if I'm gonna go with the if I should stop do I have a strange stuff?
[1324.16s -> 1330.83s]  I don't we'll go with the whole set. How do you stop a gay bed easy?
[1330.83s -> 1338.56s]  You press the gay bet gay Ben gay bet in addition. I'll save you. Oh
[1342.10s -> 1353.00s]  Help me. Oh boo with the pistol. Nice
[1355.27s -> 1359.05s]  Somebody can somebody can find an empty
[1359.45s -> 1365.34s]  Randomizer server we need we need an empty randomizer server not a full one not one
[1365.34s -> 1372.59s]  That's like an arena a real good like instant respawn randomizer server with nobody in it then we can hop into it
[1372.59s -> 1383.93s]  No, I'm not doing with that. It's going to lose to be destroying me all game
[1386.62s -> 1388.38s]  So that so that is a
[1388.38s -> 1392.02s]  Quest for the germa group to find that randomizer server
[1392.14s -> 1394.14s]  How many how many
[1394.66s -> 1403.30s]  Germa points do they get for completing that quest? I said 15 German points. I know that's you
[1404.11s -> 1406.39s]  You got Optimus Prime with you
[1407.67s -> 1414.36s]  Come on now. He's gonna headshot me. I know he is he always does
[1424.50s -> 1433.18s]  Can I like vote Optimus Prime like Best Buy in the in the world like Best Buy in team fortress
[1433.26s -> 1441.78s]  Can I like can I like safely say that right now? I like really think I can he's in part of part of that
[1441.78s -> 1444.54s]  But like electric bugalow bungalow get with electric
[1445.18s -> 1449.22s]  espionage
[1449.26s -> 1464.54s]  Oh my god, why am I not hitting anybody with this? Let's get in here and then do it. That was so lucky stuff
[1465.22s -> 1467.22s]  I'm gonna die. Oh
[1467.58s -> 1474.68s]  This is a brass piece. What are you doing? Oh, did I get lucky? I did not sorry. I'm sorry
[1474.68s -> 1482.10s]  I'll get on that get on it. Somebody get on it. Somebody just sneeze on it
[1483.31s -> 1495.14s]  No, no, I refuse to die. I refuse jump it jump it jump of the pit quick
[1497.01s -> 1503.53s]  Alright, so that that is a we got a randomized server right there empty if that is the game
[1503.53s -> 1510.03s]  Oh, that was so close. Let's go find out. I need to go to
[1515.66s -> 1523.86s]  Add a server. Let's see if this one has like no people in it. Alright, so here we go
[1524.06s -> 1530.10s]  This is the server that we're going into right now. You ready guys. Yes
[1530.94s -> 1536.59s]  207.188.214.12
[1536.91s -> 1540.87s]  colon two eight zero one six go go go go go
[1541.39s -> 1552.30s]  Attempt in one five idiot. How dare I assume so randomizes like heavies with spy knives

[1581.98s -> 1584.42s]  I don't know. I gotta get in there first
[1585.51s -> 1589.63s]  See if this one was existing we're gonna have to change. This is no way I'll get in there now

[1623.34s -> 1626.52s]  There you go. That's the one we're playing on right now
[1626.52s -> 1631.09s]  The other one filled up too quickly and has a lot of slot reservations. All right, there we go
[1631.73s -> 1645.15s]  Thank you Ari or Zeus whoever it is and doesn't really matter whatever you pick what okay, this is like the oddest thing ever

[1669.91s -> 1672.99s]  The the hand models of me sometimes they're fine
[1672.99s -> 1676.87s]  Sometimes they're just totally broken because I'm a soldier and I have medic gloves with my syringe gun
[1676.91s -> 1681.46s]  Then I pull out a weird-looking winger and he has normal hands
[1681.46s -> 1687.90s]  Dude, I'm holding this wrench like a gun and it's like I'm not even touching it. It's like floating in my hand
[1688.72s -> 1693.28s]  Who has the century this guy spy with a degreaser?
[1696.34s -> 1701.82s]  It's floating around like a clown. That is an oxymoron right there spy with a flamethrower

[1758.94s -> 1763.52s]  This could be interesting and I zoom in every funny good
[1763.64s -> 1776.23s]  Hold on this guy has it that guy just had the Natasha as a sniper and he was holding it like a sniper rifle shooting
[1776.23s -> 1780.17s]  Oh my gosh
[1780.17s -> 1781.89s]  I'm using the
[1781.93s -> 1786.29s]  Overdose and if you like reload and shoot at the same time you can just keep shooting forever
[1787.09s -> 1795.20s]  I was like yeah, like it instantly reloads it all right. Oh wait. No it doesn't actually like shoot
[1795.20s -> 1800.84s]  Look at this like pump action like freak out gun. I'm using what else do I have on the pistol?

[1902.73s -> 1910.07s]  Oh, okay, that's it. Did I kill him I got so the a poco fists are the regular fists
[1910.07s -> 1915.43s]  But they give people when you crit them. I don't think I was hurting anyone. I was shooting them. It wasn't doing damage
[1916.79s -> 1924.10s]  Numbers weren't popping up above their head god. This this like makes me so happy like this mode doesn't doesn't just make you like so hell

[1964.42s -> 1969.96s]  I need German. I need you to tell me what I have all right. We're actually I'm standing outside the spawn door
[1969.96s -> 1974.12s]  I just I have no idea what says you have the direct hit the crits Creek and
[1974.76s -> 1978.44s]  Also, Chris Creek. Yeah, you have the crits crazy. Let's see what this looks like from my point of view
[1978.44s -> 1985.10s]  This is retarded. I just saw like two seconds all right. I got the fist. I don't even have a secondary
[1985.18s -> 1993.89s]  Okay, I don't have a secondary apparently. It's probably the razorback so razorback fists of steel wait. What's fish cake?
[1994.01s -> 2006.84s]  It's like a reskin of the chocolate. Yeah, this is so why does this look so perfect with the sniper? Oh come?
[2007.44s -> 2019.96s]  We just got crits too. We got crits. I'm a spy knife read the top of the screen. What's at the top of the screen?
[2019.96s -> 2030.70s]  Oh, oh god. I am so stupid wow wow wow you uh wow look at how stupid
[2030.70s -> 2038.40s]  I am it says what you have right there, but that wasn't like right when you spawn it tells you what you have
[2038.40s -> 2043.97s]  Oh my god. This is not there. I'm using like a regular pyro set right now
[2043.97s -> 2054.73s]  I literally have the like a normal active. What do I for a melee golden wrench?
[2054.81s -> 2061.87s]  I'm a dimmer man with the enforcer and the guns like broken apart and floating well. I got it
[2061.87s -> 2064.75s]  I got a golden wrench somebody. I don't know. I'm trying to reflect Rockets
[2064.75s -> 2074.30s]  I don't know what he has called the wrench they turn to a gold statue. Don't know yeah, they do I've never seen
[2078.87s -> 2085.77s]  Yeah, everyone's like he's like he's a different class and I was standing in the same spot. Oh this person's awesome
[2085.77s -> 2092.42s]  Why do they keep like capturing the flag so quickly? That's like the kill
[2094.02s -> 2102.09s]  Kretsna, oh, that's too funny. I don't know. I don't think I could play this mode a
[2102.69s -> 2110.39s]  Thousand times and I would probably laugh just as hard every single time. It's just this medic is holding this enforcer light like a
[2111.66s -> 2112.78s]  like a
[2112.78s -> 2117.10s]  Gang member like sideways. I want I want everyone to see just how I picked that up look at this
[2117.34s -> 2123.58s]  Like oh yeah, let me just spin this giant axe in my hand. It's like a hundred and eighty pounds
[2123.58s -> 2127.76s]  Let me just hold it with one hand. It's not even doing any swing animation
[2128.00s -> 2137.42s]  There's no swing animation with that. This is so odd my brain like cannot handle how this looks
[2137.42s -> 2139.98s]  It actually looks like kind of normal to be honest
[2139.98s -> 2147.94s]  I feel like that's the way like a shotgun would act in somebody's hands like no one
[2147.94s -> 2152.54s]  I'm gonna lot of kills with this enforcer. Oh, let me just one second guys
[2152.54s -> 2156.22s]  Let me spin up my like 200 pound axe in one hand. Let me go cool
[2156.22s -> 2161.89s]  Look at look at all useful. This is gonna be come on. I gotta kill him with it
[2168.00s -> 2185.34s]  Now who keep well, that was weird. No swing animation. You can't tell I got burger boy the insensitive one
[2185.70s -> 2188.26s]  Burger boy, you can't call for medic man. Nobody has it
[2189.30s -> 2201.28s]  It could be like a heavy with the damn crits critical the many gun engineer with the Natasha the winger and the atomizer
[2201.52s -> 2207.37s]  Can I double can I triple jump? I can double jump. I can double jump as the engineer
[2208.25s -> 2215.45s]  Probably the atomizer. Yeah, I have the atomizer with the ng. I can double jump and I can build building. That's a spy
[2215.89s -> 2223.77s]  You I get the cool setup and I die instantly this happens every single day. I turn the corner
[2223.77s -> 2227.75s]  Oh, that was the spy. So I was going invisible behind people my force of nature
[2231.11s -> 2235.35s]  Invisible that's crazy term a singer song. That's somebody just said
[2237.01s -> 2240.79s]  Come on winger. Oh, let me look. Let me hold. Let me let me just
[2241.91s -> 2243.45s]  like a little
[2243.45s -> 2251.76s]  No words can describe that. I can't even make a joke. It's too stupid. Oh god. That's a dead
[2251.76s -> 2254.80s]  That's a dying battle right there. I have the revolver
[2254.88s -> 2261.44s]  My spy has three hands because I'm holding killing gloves a box and I pull up my cello
[2263.44s -> 2267.35s]  Scout with a minigun everyone run for your life
[2270.41s -> 2279.94s]  Teagle challenges me to a duel. Yeah, I wonder how mad burger boy is right now
[2279.94s -> 2288.66s]  I bet you burger boy is screaming at his computer screen. I healed for a hundred points as a sniper
[2290.54s -> 2295.89s]  X-tank, wait, am I holding this backwards? All right. Look at how I'm holding this
[2295.89s -> 2302.87s]  I could really hurt myself with this thing fish cake. Oh, it still works
[2302.87s -> 2313.69s]  I will let me launch your fish cake and the backwards extinguisher. Hmm. Yeah, make sure don't drop it on your face
[2315.05s -> 2323.33s]  I have two shotguns scout a gun of family business. I have the syringe gun of the heavy
[2323.33s -> 2333.60s]  I don't like this what just even killed me what what I am confused. That was weird
[2333.72s -> 2343.73s]  We do do do do do bring up. Oh, that's my favorite dubstep song. How'd you know? I was doing the heavy minigun noise
[2350.82s -> 2359.29s]  Charge and charge can I charge as a sniper? I can't oh, I can't charge. Damn it. What?
[2359.65s -> 2365.08s]  Okay, so I'm I'm a spy and all I have is the tribal and shit. I don't have any other item
[2366.06s -> 2373.31s]  Can you cloak? Yeah, I wish I could charge and charge right there. That would have been hilarious
[2373.31s -> 2379.20s]  I just spawned and for some reason I spawned with like 350 health overheal. Yeah
[2379.20s -> 2383.70s]  I think I think some of the people do something. I think everyone does be honest. I'm spawning over heels
[2383.70s -> 2385.72s]  I have a rocket jumper
[2385.72s -> 2393.98s]  I guess no, maybe not everybody bootlegger Razorback. Okay, this is actually a pretty good setup. I know I can't charge
[2393.98s -> 2403.77s]  Oh, this sucks. Never mind guys. That's the worst set up ever. I got a razor back though. I can't be back
[2403.77s -> 2410.87s]  I had Girardi rocket jumper and
[2411.75s -> 2414.25s]  Equalizer I can't
[2417.69s -> 2429.54s]  I'm a spy with a tribal men's ship and that is literally a if you shoot me a duel I'll do you I'll do anybody
[2429.54s -> 2439.70s]  Why not? Absolutely dead ringer heavy vote for the next map. Let's go to
[2440.34s -> 2447.19s]  Bad water bad water sounds fun. Alright, so I have I'm a soldier with a big earner and the enforcer
[2447.19s -> 2454.74s]  Don't work the taunt. I can't do the taunt. Damn it. Taunt doesn't work with this thing. What the hell better off?
[2454.78s -> 2462.28s]  Yes, I was scotch resistance. I have no idea how this works
[2464.48s -> 2470.65s]  Okay, right. Look at that's just pointing straight down into the ground. That's so funny
[2470.65s -> 2475.67s]  Oh, this thing's great for people to jump in
[2483.82s -> 2487.86s]  I don't think I've even seen the guy I'm dueling one time
[2491.81s -> 2497.18s]  Oh my god, that guy's got so many people that Natasha. All right
[2497.18s -> 2501.82s]  this will be the last round of the randomizer and then we'll go to one more random server and
[2502.79s -> 2510.42s]  Oh my god, I'm a medic with the Natasha and a different screen. Well, what do I have for mail?
[2510.42s -> 2521.30s]  I didn't even read it. Oh the wrench. Oh, you thought the medic was just gonna be healing didn't you? Oh my god
[2521.30s -> 2529.52s]  This is so OP. Now. I just switch over get some heels around a little bit
[2531.24s -> 2536.34s]  I'm a spy running around with heavy fists punching people
[2537.34s -> 2540.43s]  Well, I got you. I got your king Dedede. Oh
[2544.39s -> 2558.34s]  Come on, give me those crits. Come on. Come on. Where is somebody? Oh, this is so insane
[2559.10s -> 2565.93s]  Medic with a god damn mini gun. Are you serious? And I'm healing people with the crits for you
[2565.93s -> 2570.26s]  This is ridiculous and I can upgrade and repair buildings
[2572.90s -> 2579.81s]  Wait, what's the big kill? It's a reskin of the revolver. I have a revolver and I have a pistol
[2579.81s -> 2587.67s]  I don't even know what he has. What does he have? Let's get the Scottish resistance. Somebody do something
[2587.75s -> 2592.19s]  Well, what that last like two seconds?
[2592.19s -> 2599.10s]  I had this thing called a jar of ants is that just I thought it was dry
[2599.10s -> 2603.42s]  But when I threw it at people they would like taking damage. I never seen that pool. That's weird
[2603.42s -> 2609.60s]  I get that is healed a thousand points as a pyro. I was I don't think it was that even a pyro
[2609.60s -> 2614.85s]  That was weird. Did you did it? Did you did it?
[2616.87s -> 2622.48s]  So because I'm a spy I have a wrench and I can't I can either disguise but I can't build anything
[2622.68s -> 2633.57s]  All right shotgun short-circuit. What what is going on? I'm so confused. This is how he's holding the shotgun. Hold on
[2633.77s -> 2635.27s]  Hi
[2635.27s -> 2640.19s]  So this is that's the reserve. Oh, I have the knife too
[2640.67s -> 2648.40s]  Okay, I was holding the shotgun down like a minigun and it was like shaking. I couldn't even like tell where I was shooting
[2649.44s -> 2655.95s]  All right. So after this we're gonna go to a no, I'm getting the worst things ever
[2656.19s -> 2664.02s]  Yeah, I got a great one last time the medic medic set up. All right, so bonk it
[2664.02s -> 2672.70s]  Oh, this is gonna be great bonk a tongue punch. Does it do anything? Am I am I'm invincible, right? Yeah, I am sick
[2672.94s -> 2681.19s]  I'm getting I'm getting all these pistols. What what?
[2683.96s -> 2691.38s]  Buffalo steak sandwich to again mini crits and you take mini crits, but you can't use anything but melee that was weird
[2691.38s -> 2695.86s]  I'm the no swing animation throws me off cuz I'm just like standing there. I'm like am I even swinging people
[2695.86s -> 2706.04s]  Oh, it's tied up now. Oh, we don't make it. Wait a minute. How does the widow maker even work?
[2706.16s -> 2710.24s]  How would the widow maker work? Am I this is infinite ammo? Well, how's this gonna work?
[2710.24s -> 2720.08s]  I think I just haven't fitted ammo. Oh, no, I can't lose this. No shit. No
[2721.20s -> 2723.08s]  I really think I just had it fitted in with that thing
[2723.08s -> 2743.70s]  We're getting my spawn trapped now the front two justice had ten shots and I'm confusing. Oh, man
[2743.70s -> 2750.42s]  Oh, yeah, I still have metal like yeah. Yeah, I just can't see it. That's still funny. All right
[2750.94s -> 2757.56s]  We're gonna go one more a random just normal server to play and then we're gonna hop in a CS go
[2757.72s -> 2767.60s]  Let's do let's find another good server. Sure. Let's try and get a
[2768.42s -> 2772.46s]  32 person here we go. Oh, let's go back and turbine
[2772.62s -> 2782.42s]  No, no, no, no go to dust bowl. That's 30. That's got 32 right now. Yeah, we're gonna do it
[2782.42s -> 2786.53s]  There are 32 people can play in this. So this would be the last shebang
[2786.53s -> 2791.21s]  I gotta give it to burger boy first. Hold on burger boy will like flip out if I don't and
[2792.54s -> 2797.58s]  then ready 96

[2801.33s -> 2808.66s]  36 2 7 0 1 5 and join and that's the server guys
[2811.06s -> 2816.08s]  Good old dust ball good old-fashioned dust ball. Oh, it's not randomized
[2816.48s -> 2821.10s]  No, this is just a regular. Okay. Oh, yes dust ball my favorite
[2821.10s -> 2827.90s]  I like dust ball people don't like it, but I like it. I like it after that brass beast game yesterday

[4188.32s -> 4193.16s]  Because I was in drama and like middle school so I was like I'm a good actor you could have been a star dude
[4193.20s -> 4207.98s]  Who's constant back up back up back up. Whoa look what console just said whoo in the chat or in them
[4211.52s -> 4215.80s]  Somebody said oh, so you got a live streamer right now. Well, thanks for choosing the QQ buffet. Oh

[4235.82s -> 4239.10s]  Oh, no, so this is like a legit stalemate right now
[4239.10s -> 4243.55s]  I think because I want to get see it's going so we might have to like
[4244.11s -> 4251.98s]  16 on 16. Yeah, this is just a this is just a totally balanced game right now. No respawn delays on dustbowl
[4261.10s -> 4272.81s]  I'm gonna go we got a ton of engineers do which you know, I can't no no change which it either
[4272.81s -> 4281.54s]  Oh, I hear the fan. See your fan just turn on mine. I just heard
[4282.06s -> 4287.93s]  And I was probably yours. She probably was mine. You're right. No, it's fine mine
[4287.93s -> 4298.82s]  Oh my look at the three bags my god run run away
[4299.62s -> 4317.16s]  Run away after I think afterburn you could you could tweak afterburn a little bit make it a little more balanced
[4317.20s -> 4319.80s]  Maybe you'd make a shorter duration but more damage
[4319.84s -> 4325.43s]  So like instead of like 10 seconds or whatever it is make it like four or five seconds
[4325.43s -> 4330.19s]  But have it do more damage a little bit more damage. It's okay in its current form though
[4330.19s -> 4334.31s]  I think I don't think it's that it's not that bad. Oh my god. Oh
[4342.12s -> 4346.37s]  You got it. Hello. Hello, mr. Medic. How are you?
[4349.08s -> 4351.06s]  I

[4357.96s -> 4374.53s]  No backstab. I'm gonna go I'm going scalp at the end here. This is such a difficult game to win
[4374.53s -> 4380.74s]  Oh my god, but I don't think I've seen you once. No, I've been I keep getting killed by Jemma
[4383.03s -> 4395.06s]  Stop being so selfish. I want kills too. I just mean I got like I was like octo heavy for this like whole thing
[4395.42s -> 4407.44s]  Two or three medics on me not anymore though. I'm saying as to scoot. No
[4420.71s -> 4427.63s]  Imagine a team of 16 spies all just cloaked sneak on the point and at the same time all decloak and capture
[4427.63s -> 4433.17s]  I was gonna say imagine that and like they they just like pretend that they're the other team
[4436.46s -> 4439.64s]  Super spy check mode super spy check
[4447.46s -> 4454.61s]  Oh, it took me so long to get ahead of you. Oh man, dude, look at look at the
[4456.14s -> 4463.24s]  Metals, that's ridiculous. I feel I want to like switch to blue. I can't though
[4463.24s -> 4476.20s]  Oh my yeah, the domination like things nice headshot sick. Come on blue. Oh
[4478.26s -> 4479.80s]  stealth
[4479.80s -> 4482.36s]  Come on blue man 61
[4482.84s -> 4497.92s]  Ready to charge doctor. Oh, they got a big century back there now tables good turn right now
[4498.16s -> 4501.76s]  You guys got a good uber good like push coming tables
[4501.76s -> 4509.12s]  Um, not too sure about the uber is that uber charge, but are you sure about the push?
[4511.30s -> 4514.90s]  Confidence is growing slightly. I'm standing in the tunnel not taking damage
[4518.24s -> 4523.92s]  What about burger boy just stand here burger boy
[4525.02s -> 4534.50s]  I think it's nothing good about this team. Oh burger boy burger boy
[4534.90s -> 4542.10s]  There's nothing good. Yes stuff at last
[4543.06s -> 4546.19s]  There's nothing good about this team
[4559.56s -> 4568.23s]  Fire I wish I could hear that but I have my voice chat turned off
[4568.23s -> 4576.67s]  That would be funny to be able to watch that burger boy. There's nothing really upset
[4576.67s -> 4578.54s]  All right
[4578.54s -> 4580.54s]  So burger boy on a scale of 1 to 10
[4580.58s -> 4586.71s]  10 being like like you will like rip down your house like burn your house down and one being like
[4586.71s -> 4590.23s]  I guess I'm like kind of mad how like pissed off are you right now?
[4592.27s -> 4598.46s]  I bet you it's at least a seven or an eight. Oh, let's speak. Let's be quiet so we can hear his answer
[4598.46s -> 4601.10s]  I can't hear it. So it's you're gonna have to relay it to me
[4607.83s -> 4620.55s]  Actually, maybe he's not even listening to the stream. No, maybe he forgot. I was screaming. Oh, they got that. Where's that spies right there?
[4620.55s -> 4624.14s]  Oh my gosh
[4624.30s -> 4626.47s]  What do you say? What is that?
[4628.87s -> 4635.32s]  Is that what he thought damn it I wish I could have my I need to turn it on hold on
[4635.36s -> 4649.91s]  Oh my god. All right. All right, you can tell him to do it again burger boy. Do it again burger boy rage again
[4649.91s -> 4670.22s]  Is he gonna do it? Oh, no, he's not like actually bad. I wish I caught that on video. Oh, you're losing burger boy
[4670.22s -> 4676.32s]  It's over. Oh look at it. It's it's all over. Let's see what he says. Hold on. Here it comes
[4676.32s -> 4687.83s]  Oh, what do you say about that burger boy? And what cuz I want no I want him to like flip out. He's silent
[4689.52s -> 4695.54s]  Yeah, but I did he's still here. No, he's not yeah
[4697.13s -> 4699.49s]  Alright, I'm gonna transition to
[4700.78s -> 4706.12s]  CS go. Thanks for coming. No, you're not allowed to come. Yeah
[4721.56s -> 4732.03s]  All right, let me um, let me try and figure out how to do CS go could be sort of difficult
[4732.03s -> 4740.90s]  I'm gonna do windowed mode. It's gonna take maybe a few seconds. Give me a minute guys counter-strike global effects
[4740.90s -> 4748.54s]  All right screens gonna go black for 20 or 30 seconds
[4748.54s -> 4753.76s]  I'm still here. Don't worry. Oh, no black screen. Oh
[4754.40s -> 4766.27s]  What do we do? It's a black screen. Oh burger boy. You're listening right now after we play this for like 20 or 30 minutes
[4766.27s -> 4775.78s]  We're going to McDonald's. We're going to get double cheeseburgers. I hope you know that video settings
[4775.96s -> 4779.40s]  We are going to be playing in
[4779.56s -> 4783.16s]  windowed
[4783.16s -> 4785.08s]  1280 by 7
[4785.08s -> 4788.62s]  I think I'm gonna go and play Call of Duty 4 so I'll drop out the
[4788.94s -> 4792.92s]  Job out the chat, but I'll see I'll still listen to the stream. Okay, that's cool
[4796.34s -> 4799.74s]  Yeah, I can do I know what you're saying at all times stuff
[4804.28s -> 4808.64s]  If you're back later and happy days, but enjoy CS go
[4809.20s -> 4814.44s]  Thanks. Thanks for coming boo. Thank you. Bye. No, all righty
[4814.56s -> 4822.77s]  So we're gonna try and we're gonna play some CS go gonna play some gun game
[4822.77s -> 4828.80s]  And if you're more than if you have this you're more than welcome to try and join in off of me or if stealth is
[4828.80s -> 4830.80s]  appearing online him it's gonna be difficult
[4831.24s -> 4836.46s]  it's gonna be kind of difficult to get everyone in the game because it's um
[4836.82s -> 4844.13s]  Wait valve confirms that meet the pyro is already done and ready. Holy crap
[4844.13s -> 4854.08s]  That means we're gonna get it soon unless we don't unless it doesn't happen. Yeah, at least we don't get it
[4856.71s -> 4861.55s]  Someone like sneak like I would steal that if I like work for valve and put it on the internet
[4867.16s -> 4870.76s]  Yeah, you probably would get fired that would not be good
[4876.44s -> 4884.59s]  You guys can hardly they're they're quiet. Are they still quiet who they are like me. Apparently you guys are quiet
[4884.59s -> 4890.96s]  I don't know why I just try to turn you up. That's odd
[4891.48s -> 4895.11s]  Did you did you did it? So this is gun game?
[4895.11s -> 4900.96s]  This is like legit like gun game was it like that the whole time or was it like that?
[4900.96s -> 4907.05s]  Just for uh for when I changed over was it like that during tf2 as well. Oh
[4915.51s -> 4926.10s]  Get gun games
[4926.10s -> 4932.50s]  Also, they so they were both low really really low for the team the team borders or just at the end there
[4932.58s -> 4941.01s]  That's weird the whole time. No someone they were saying it's like the end of team for just to probably when I transitioned over
[4941.01s -> 4949.02s]  Oh, oh, yeah. So this is the gun game. This is my favorite thing about this game. I love gun game
[4949.02s -> 4953.80s]  I can't handle the kid
[4955.29s -> 4959.49s]  Thanks for the feedback guys. I appreciate it because I I try to it's hard to make it
[4959.97s -> 4963.49s]  Sometimes explet is weird and they just lower the volume of everybody
[4963.49s -> 4967.93s]  I don't know why but so thanks for uh, thanks for being here to be able to tell me what's going on
[4967.97s -> 4976.27s]  So if you don't know what this is every time you get a kill every single time you kill somebody you
[4976.55s -> 4981.47s]  Get you get a different gun and I think it's 26 or 27 kills
[4981.47s -> 4995.75s]  I don't know the nice healthy stuff is the worst counter-strike play ever. I must have to in general doon-doon-doon-doon-doon
[4995.87s -> 5006.26s]  No, it's fine. Oh, I'm not standing still don't look at me. That's off of his prime
[5006.90s -> 5018.14s]  Optimus Prime. Oh, he's dead. Oh, I'm gonna get behind. Oh damn it. This is still in beta
[5018.14s -> 5018.38s]  Yep
[5018.38s -> 5024.94s]  So as you see when I kill somebody else see if I can show you right when I kill somebody the instant I do it
[5024.94s -> 5031.57s]  I'm gonna switch a gun. It's gonna go to something else. This is the like shotgun type thing
[5031.57s -> 5041.55s]  Oh, I'd love to show them that example, too, but I can't get a kill to switch my gun
[5041.55s -> 5045.73s]  Hey, well, you're not really on the screen. I was just saying ah
[5046.63s -> 5053.28s]  Yeah, we're this is PC. I don't this is not really even getting developed right now for consoles
[5053.28s -> 5058.48s]  I think they're doing that later. Yeah, I think it's actually co-developed for car. I could be totally wrong
[5058.48s -> 5067.39s]  I'm not sure on that. Oh, well, that's that's how you miss three times point-blank
[5067.39s -> 5073.90s]  Well, that was the auto shotgun somebody's already reached knife level
[5073.90s -> 5076.98s]  So once you go through all the guns once you get like 27 kills
[5077.26s -> 5082.84s]  You you use a knife and you have to knife somebody and if you knife them the game's over and you win
[5082.96s -> 5090.26s]  Well, whatever team had the person knifing. Thanks
[5090.78s -> 5104.14s]  Come on, keep you going. Damn it. Ah, oh, that's game. Oh, so do you want ways MLC still?
[5105.17s -> 5110.76s]  At the bottom of the league of boards. Yeah, this is definitely the best mode in Counter-Strike
[5110.76s -> 5115.64s]  No, in my opinion it used to be a mod then they made it like an actual game mode. It's so fun
[5115.72s -> 5120.65s]  Hey, what do you mean go go see teeth? What up? What a delic?
[5120.81s -> 5124.60s]  Yeah, I mean the streams been going for like an hour and a half now
[5124.60s -> 5127.56s]  So if some of you guys got to go you got to go. Thanks for coming. Appreciate it
[5127.56s -> 5131.79s]  Oh, I love this map. I love this map. This is a map. Shibby was like losing his mind on
[5133.36s -> 5145.07s]  There's only two maps. Oh, I love this one. Oh, that's right. There's only two maps. What oh no bullets
[5145.15s -> 5153.12s]  Wait, didn't there used to be a map? There is where it's in the top left. What are you talking about?
[5153.12s -> 5155.28s]  Oh, cuz there's nothing up there for me. Oh
[5156.36s -> 5159.88s]  Well, you must have been glitching out. Oh, there it is. It just came out there dad
[5159.88s -> 5166.77s]  Oh, I got a headshot from across the map. Well, I'm gonna make a ton of vids and packs man
[5166.93s -> 5176.70s]  It's gonna mean me and taxis are gonna be best friends when it comes to videos. I'm in trouble. No
[5177.14s -> 5188.80s]  Running the bullets burger boy has a YouTube channel. He's his first video is gonna be going up and like probably like 15 months
[5188.92s -> 5190.36s]  Oh
[5190.36s -> 5214.78s]  Show yourself. I gotta get a good string together. Oh, come on. Damn
[5214.78s -> 5226.88s]  I hear these people in the chat saying like this game of sucks. No way
[5226.92s -> 5236.09s]  Let's get this is the most fun game mode on don't see us know what our teammates here Sam
[5236.09s -> 5247.12s]  Oh really that is goomba stomp that guy. I don't think I did. I mean we had that conversation last night
[5247.12s -> 5249.12s]  We were like, can you goomba stomp? What's going on here?
[5249.16s -> 5254.09s]  Cuz it said I like damage the teammate when I land on top of them. Oh my god
[5254.17s -> 5265.48s]  Can't believe it how many bullets does it take? Yeah, my favorite gun in CS
[5265.48s -> 5275.76s]  Go is probably the shotgun. He just regular shotgun. I love that thing. Oh, come on this thing
[5275.76s -> 5281.60s]  This is my favorite gun in CS right now. I love this thing. Unfortunately when I get one kill that it's going away
[5281.84s -> 5291.55s]  No, I'll see it's gone. I don't know how you get kills in this
[5291.55s -> 5300.28s]  No one dies when I shoot them is the auto shoddy P90 is awesome, too
[5300.42s -> 5306.74s]  Everything is pretty balanced in this game. There's way too many of them over there. No way I was gonna do that
[5306.90s -> 5317.54s]  I'm the worst counter-strike player. I literally don't think it's the worst one
[5317.54s -> 5324.90s]  You know, it's it's tough playing this game in a window. It is very hard to do this. My like my my hands look so tiny
[5324.90s -> 5339.06s]  It's like yeah, I'm little baby. I can't believe I didn't kill him. Do I like pretzels? I love pretzels rolled gold, baby
[5339.36s -> 5346.43s]  I'm doing absolutely terrible right now terrible. I wish I could full screen this
[5346.43s -> 5356.69s]  All right, X split make it so I can full screen my game first problem. There's no hats second problem
[5356.69s -> 5360.88s]  No hats third problem. No lasers
[5361.68s -> 5365.47s]  fourth problem
[5365.47s -> 5382.04s]  Oh my gosh, that killed me. I'm sorry. I got already on the line machine gun. I was doing pretty well last night

[5413.16s -> 5418.44s]  cookie jar
[5418.44s -> 5426.90s]  Okay, really? Oh, well, I'm a moron. No, I'm not shooting. I'm shooting my own teammates up
[5426.90s -> 5434.13s]  Oh, I thought I was gonna get him. I got it. I gotta get in tryhard mode now
[5434.13s -> 5447.04s]  I want to get a good game tryhard mode activate three and two. Let's go

[5452.44s -> 5462.49s]  Gotta get that gun game gotta get that gun game up. I didn't see that guy
[5462.49s -> 5474.65s]  I got it blended in with the background. Let's go. Let's go. Keep it moving. Keep it moving here. Keep it moving
[5474.97s -> 5482.56s]  Okay, I literally think I'm doing 99% damage to people and then other people are just taking the last shot
[5484.06s -> 5494.66s]  Well, LL Cool J in here. Let me see if I can speak up on it. We go. There we go
[5494.66s -> 5505.42s]  So that's what I'm talking about. Now we're now we're going now we're going strong do
[5513.78s -> 5515.78s]  Moving keep it moving here. Keep it moving. Oh
[5517.38s -> 5524.75s]  Eggs, I gotta try hard like an egg. How do you have 14 freaking points?
[5524.75s -> 5544.97s]  I went to try hard boy. Didn't I tell you I'm not messing around anymore. No more messing around dude sniper rifle

[5562.16s -> 5566.86s]  Oh, that was that wasn't killing. Ah
[5573.38s -> 5582.46s]  Come on. It's hard when you get to the pistols. It gets difficult. This is where it gets really difficult
[5582.46s -> 5585.20s]  It gets difficult when you're using any gun in this
[5586.26s -> 5606.50s]  Trying to pull up a headshot not gonna happen. Oh, come on now. Come on now. Oh
[5608.58s -> 5630.92s]  Oh, I had it. I had it. Come on. Let me win this round. No crap in my pants. No, this is not good
[5630.92s -> 5637.57s]  I gotta find a way around damn it. All right, I'm gonna someone over here
[5637.57s -> 5643.65s]  Oh, I can't believe I didn't hit in the face losing it now. I'm losing it
[5643.65s -> 5651.88s]  I had it had it for a little bit. No, I'm gonna lose it. I'm gonna lose it
[5651.88s -> 5668.60s]  I was so far ahead. I gotta kick off somebody. I'm going this way, man. There we go
[5668.84s -> 5675.67s]  Finally got out of that stupid pistol. Now. I got the dual Berettas dude. Oh this guy
[5675.67s -> 5682.88s]  I'm gonna make this guy's day bad this egg over here. Where would this egg go? He's had a clean shot on that egg
[5682.88s -> 5695.44s]  Oh my god, I can't believe I didn't do it. That was a lucky spawn. Did I get it again?
[5695.44s -> 5705.77s]  Yeah, I did it. Oh, yeah. I can't believe I won the game. That's the first time that's ever happened
[5705.77s -> 5717.21s]  This game's so hard. I just made them rage quit. Yeah, that's the first time I've ever done that
[5717.25s -> 5726.03s]  Wow, that was a I wish I was like I wish I was like recording that because it's probably not gonna happen again
[5726.03s -> 5730.36s]  Well, you kind of were recording that
[5730.52s -> 5736.78s]  I own Battlefield 3 so do not you don't don't please do not get Battlefield 3 for me
[5736.78s -> 5744.29s]  I appreciate the gesture though. Like thank you so much for even considering doing that, but I have Battlefield 3
[5744.29s -> 5760.81s]  Oh boo, did you see my I just won did you see it was for you? Yeah, but I'm I don't it's gonna be
[5760.93s -> 5769.10s]  360 I guess I could use it. I could use that. Oh you bastard Optimus Prime
[5769.26s -> 5773.30s]  Hey, what do you know? Optimus Prime has the knife in this game and he's wicked good with it
[5775.24s -> 5777.24s]  Coincidence I don't think so
[5785.45s -> 5799.50s]  Give me that headshot. Give me that headshot. Oh, no. Oh
[5804.14s -> 5807.48s]  All right. I'm I I quit the game you left
[5808.00s -> 5820.71s]  Optimus Prime spits in the hill. Oh, I guess he's wicked good counter-strike source. Did I say source?
[5820.75s -> 5825.12s]  I meant counter-strike go stealth can't take it. Oh
[5831.99s -> 5840.68s]  Jump down. I was doing alright in the beginning. I was doing alright
[5840.68s -> 5847.27s]  See if I can come back to life here what how does how does that make any sense?
[5847.35s -> 5858.04s]  How I killed that guy did I shoot him through the grate and how the hell did that happen?
[5858.04s -> 5865.36s]  Yeah, I'm not sure how much money it'll be I was assuming it won't be more than 50 bucks
[5865.36s -> 5877.48s]  It probably wouldn't be more than 40. I bet you it's I'm gonna say 30 bucks. That's my prediction again
[5877.48s -> 5880.88s]  I could be totally wrong really depends on what kind of strategy they want to go for
[5881.12s -> 5906.33s]  No, Steve stop killing people. I can't see what gun you have. Oh, this is gonna be tough sniper
[5906.33s -> 5909.97s]  I'm gonna have to like cool. I'm gonna have to like call of duty quickscope somebody. Oh
[5915.83s -> 5924.99s]  Where'd he go? Where'd he go? Where'd he go? How did I not hit him? There we go
[5928.16s -> 5938.60s]  LMG is that the real burger boy? You better believe it. You better believe Oh
[5947.04s -> 5966.56s]  Greg oh, that's a bot bot Greg. Come on. I'm at the crystal level. Well, this is a bot. Come on. This is a damn
