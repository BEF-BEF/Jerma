[19.32s -> 28.12s]  How's it going? Welcome. Welcome back. He's already telling us to relax.
[29.00s -> 33.13s]  Yeah, a mod will make it funny in a few minutes. Well then here's the thing.
[35.18s -> 41.90s]  You tell me. I have a question for you. So, a title. The title of this stream.
[43.48s -> 48.52s]  A lot of people will say, okay, so the game we're playing is The Last Hero of Nostalgia.
[49.32s -> 54.36s]  It's like a comedy parody Dark Souls game. It looks like something I wanted to play for a while.
[54.92s -> 60.52s]  The problem is, I don't know what's in this game. Right? How do you title something that you don't
[60.52s -> 65.88s]  know? I can't make a reference to this game. I don't know what's in it. So how do you title that?
[65.88s -> 75.03s]  We need to wait. We need, we should take a system on this channel of soft titles. Because after
[75.03s -> 78.47s]  about 30 minutes, you know that some monster is going to show up and everyone's going to give it
[78.47s -> 85.35s]  a name and the title is going to be like Gunu's Revenge. You understand? It's a soft title.
[85.99s -> 94.62s]  Anyways, how you doing? Hope you're doing well. Kind of just play a game today. I can tell you
[94.62s -> 101.37s]  the plan. Oh, that is, uh, well, I haven't told you yet. So today we're going to play this. Just
[101.37s -> 107.98s]  going to chill out. Play it until it's in. Look, if I don't like it, then I'll play something else.
[107.98s -> 114.25s]  Maybe jump around to a few games. Maybe I really like this. Looks really cool. Looks really
[114.25s -> 125.50s]  interesting. A soft Gunu stream. But so this is, we're doing this tonight. Tomorrow night,
[126.22s -> 131.18s]  tomorrow night, uh, I have a sponsor stream. I haven't seen one of those in a while. It's
[131.18s -> 140.70s]  been a few months and that sponsor stream is going to be to play Wild Hearts. Those of you that have
[140.70s -> 145.78s]  seen Wild Hearts, it looks like it's pretty fun. It'll be sponsored to play it. I'll be playing
[145.78s -> 152.33s]  tomorrow with Vinny. That's the plan. We don't, we're trying to figure it out. It's possible. It's
[153.58s -> 164.76s]  set in stone kind of, but I will be sponsored to play it. If you don't know what it is,
[164.76s -> 170.98s]  it's kind of in that. It's like a monster hunter in that monster hunter world, but I believe there's
[170.98s -> 177.99s]  changes. There are some pretty interesting changes to that sort of monster hunting game. Check it
[177.99s -> 185.70s]  out. We'll see. It seems like people think it's good. So I'm really, really interested in really
[185.70s -> 203.70s]  happy to play it. What about Elden Ring? Well, Forster, Forster. Yeah, he hit me up. He's like,
[203.70s -> 211.45s]  Hey, you have an interest to keep going. And I'm like, nah, it was fun, but nah, I feel bad.
[219.61s -> 227.19s]  Why you rude? No, no, we, we had a, look, we were very, very clear about how we felt about
[227.19s -> 245.05s]  everything, but don't worry. He fucking hated it. I didn't hate it. I've just, I just had to say,
[245.45s -> 256.10s]  you know, the vibes were off and we knew that. Look, I like hanging out with Forster. Okay.
[256.82s -> 262.70s]  It doesn't matter what the game is. We'll do something else. Don't worry. We even started
[262.70s -> 269.83s]  talking about what the new thing could be. Did we, or did I make that up? Just, I don't know,
[269.83s -> 283.67s]  just in case somebody asks them. Oh, I made it up. I made it up. No, no, no, no, no, I didn't. No,
[283.67s -> 289.56s]  I didn't. No, I didn't. Okay. Yeah. Like it was like, Oh, we'll do something else at some point.
[291.32s -> 308.25s]  Yeah. Yeah. Wait, that's all good. Anyways, you're a liar. Oh, let's go. This is last hero of nostalgia
[309.99s -> 317.35s]  and this could be exciting. Just going to chill out, play a game. You know how it is. Let's go.
[319.98s -> 327.53s]  Last hero of nostalgia. So I don't, I mean, this game is kind of looks like a souls game,
[327.53s -> 334.17s]  but it's not, I think it's like a comedy game. It might be multiple genres. I, I have no idea.
[334.73s -> 341.93s]  But I wonder, is this a controller game? It might be. Yeah. I'm going in without any
[341.93s -> 347.96s]  knowledge about anything. Okay. Make sure I, okay. I got to get that off the screen.
[347.96s -> 352.28s]  All right. Brightness to set this low, great hero. You need not see the corpses.
[355.40s -> 360.54s]  I mean, I have to play games like this. Otherwise I can't see anything. I know that it's intended
[360.54s -> 365.74s]  for you to play stuff down here, but I'm sorry. I, I, I know that lots of games that do this,
[366.89s -> 375.27s]  it has to be up a little bit. Otherwise I physically can't see. How about like right here
[375.27s -> 381.27s]  is all right. Yeah. Uh, this will help you understand the game a bit and will help you
[381.27s -> 386.36s]  find the fun. Yeah. Why not? Let's do a tutorial. Okay. Good. That's the question. I just,
[386.36s -> 392.39s]  I just asked that character customization. Please use your keyboard to enter a name.
[392.95s -> 414.30s]  Okay. This is my character. Um, this isn't doing anything. Oh, I think this is the point.
[414.30s -> 438.74s]  It's not doing anything. It's all the way. Uh, max it coward. I just did. How about tattoos,
[438.74s -> 449.37s]  a couple of accessories. Um, I don't know, like here. All right. Every, how everything gets zero
[449.37s -> 468.97s]  besides endowment. All right. That looks good. How about, uh, how about, uh, I'm so bad at making
[468.97s -> 478.90s]  names now. I used to be so good at this, but now I feel like I've, I've diluted the, I've diluted
[478.90s -> 484.10s]  too much. I've, I've made up too many names in my life where now I'm just sitting here going like,
[484.10s -> 499.62s]  I don't know, uh, Fred one. How about, um, no, we have to go. It was a different character,
[499.62s -> 522.10s]  but, uh, slightly, slightly, like slightly sharp, extremely sharp, moderately. Well,
[522.10s -> 528.52s]  now I'm just naming cheeses. That's like how that's like a cheddar cheese scale. Uh,
[531.59s -> 541.46s]  minced meat, minced meat, minced meat. Is it minced meat or is it minced meat,
[541.46s -> 555.93s]  minced meat, minced meat. I like it. I think that looks good.
[555.93s -> 571.06s]  Anybody have any complaints? Minced meat glass. All right. This is important.
[571.06s -> 586.02s]  Data din or matter resolutionary sorcerer or random master. I feel like this is like the,
[586.02s -> 594.89s]  the subject line of a company email at a tech company. Like, yeah, don't, please don't say
[594.89s -> 602.76s]  this stuff. Don't call us this. All right. Hold on. We're just having to wield heavy weapons,
[602.76s -> 610.81s]  favors strength, a noble and stalwart defender of order favors vitality. Champions of fidelity.
[610.81s -> 623.00s]  They are well-rounded and versatile. Okay. Well, dexterity. I can't pick this channel.
[623.00s -> 629.38s]  Uh, a channel of nostalgia, primal energies favors source, which is magic or a scoundrel who
[629.38s -> 635.45s]  specializes in critical hits, backstabs and Perry's favors luck. I can't play the, I'm not
[635.45s -> 641.32s]  going to play the joke character right now. Should I, I don't know this. I feel like I'm going to get
[641.32s -> 656.23s]  my ass kicked for strength. Just do it. It's a joke game. You're going to be fine. It's a joke
[656.23s -> 668.42s]  game. You're fine. Okay. It's assassin slash rogue. It's not a joke. Oh, I kind of just want
[668.42s -> 679.42s]  a shitload of health. I think I just want a bunch of health. It's boring, but whatever. You are a
[679.42s -> 689.98s]  joke. Shut up. Okay. All right. Fine. I'll try it. I'll try it. I'll try it. I'll try it. So this is
[689.98s -> 702.38s]  like Perry's and backstabs. You're going to get me killed at whatever. All right. Let's go. Yes,
[702.38s -> 711.72s]  indeed. Voice acted. It is called Nostral Gaia where the wait, wait, cut, cut, cut. Was that
[711.72s -> 722.04s]  your customization screen? Oh, oh, might he save me. I don't know what you are, but you're no hero.
[722.04s -> 752.82s]  So I'm not playing the intro. They'll just get good at pairing. Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool.
[754.18s -> 761.14s]  Be hero became headed dignity. How do I move? It would impale itself on its own appendages
[761.14s -> 771.08s]  and the rid us of its pixelated shame. Okay. So there's a dodge roll actually feels pretty good.
[771.80s -> 779.90s]  Stand in a bar. Anything else I need to know? That's all. Hey, that's it. Just literally give
[779.90s -> 783.82s]  me a dodge roll with iframes to give me a light and heavy attack and I will beat your game. I
[783.82s -> 799.37s]  promise you no E the welcome host was absent. No one to tell the newest spawn what to do
[799.93s -> 815.32s]  or what it was. E. Okay. Oh, here's the messages on the ground. Yep. Okay. Wait,
[815.32s -> 823.93s]  left bumper is shield. Uh huh. Yep. You are not alone. We have walked before you go back to where
[823.93s -> 834.70s]  you came from. Hero over. Oh, hero lover had become slightly unwelcoming to new heroes
[835.26s -> 849.48s]  and those who assist them. Lock on. Use your heroic icon and heal. Oh, I have three. All right. How
[849.48s -> 861.35s]  does this work layout? Okay. Is there iframes? I think there is. There is. Okay. Cool. Do you
[861.35s -> 870.12s]  get experience? Also three uses to be replenished when you get to the next checkpoint. Okay. Use
[870.12s -> 886.57s]  it carefully. How long does it take? Oh, it takes a little while. If stirrer looks over at this
[886.57s -> 891.96s]  stream, he's going to think I'm playing modded Eldritch Ring. He's going to be like, what the
[891.96s -> 907.85s]  fuck is this? Where were these cool mods? Switch stances. Oh, okay. Green herb. You just picked up
[907.85s -> 915.24s]  an item. Check your inventory to see it. Okay. It looks like it is just like a from software game.
[915.24s -> 937.77s]  Toggle item description. The consumable heal. What is all this? The would be hero began to suspect
[937.77s -> 949.88s]  it. Perhaps it was a crit. Okay. How many hits can I take? Dude, modded. Dude, look at these cool
[949.88s -> 961.83s]  mods, man. Access, access, access. They're probably bosses too. Is there a back? There's a backstab.
[961.83s -> 980.60s]  Otherwise this character would be fucking stupid. Excess place. What does this mean? The confused
[980.68s -> 985.72s]  stick figure would find no answers in the narrator's library. All right. I'm going to die.
[985.72s -> 993.32s]  The spreading pixelization had twisted everything and everyone into retro. Oh my God. I'm going to die.
[996.44s -> 1005.58s]  It's you're supposed to lose during the tutorial. It's like every game that's ever come out. That's
[1005.58s -> 1013.93s]  in the same genre. You die and you wake up and it's like, it's like, see death is not the end.
[1014.57s -> 1017.93s]  And then you go back and I'm going to come back here with like three. Okay. I died. I saw that
[1017.93s -> 1028.60s]  scripted death. And so the stick figure proved its ineptitude. Okay. Pretty good. So now what
[1028.60s -> 1045.38s]  happens? Let's see. There we go. Okay. So you're. So I, so I died. All right. I did. I thought it
[1045.38s -> 1053.30s]  was going to do the thing that they all do. Does everything respawn? Everything does respond. All
[1053.30s -> 1062.04s]  right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. What about parries? Okay.
[1062.04s -> 1067.64s]  That is a parry try. Do I dare attempt to try to figure out the parry system in this game? Let's
[1067.64s -> 1091.69s]  see. All right. That's not bad. Pretty good. It's actually pretty forgiving. But here's the big
[1091.69s -> 1110.89s]  question. Can you parry on stairs? It's way better than Elden Ring. Way better. I actually,
[1110.89s -> 1124.34s]  it does feel fun to play though. I'm interested. Just don't die in the tutorial again. Oh, come on.
[1129.61s -> 1148.65s]  Be invincible during this? Yep. Oh, what is that? Reclaim memory. Memory restored. Oh, that's my
[1148.65s -> 1164.38s]  souls. Why? Whatever. I call it whatever I want. We're good. This is probably secrets and stuff,
[1164.38s -> 1189.30s]  but whatever. There we go. I like this game. This is a Picross like. Um, I could see where you're
[1189.30s -> 1205.14s]  coming from. It's a granny like. Nostalgia's memories had flattened like books without pages.
[1205.30s -> 1214.25s]  Oh, how the narration wound pixels were the problem. Oh, fuck. Don't be an idiot here.
[1216.09s -> 1230.95s]  Okay. If I die here, I'm going to be actually pissed off. Oh, yeah. It's a bugle berry like
[1230.95s -> 1241.30s]  that. That's cool. All right. But wait a minute. What's over here? Is there a sprint? I just
[1241.30s -> 1258.44s]  accidentally took the last heel. That's very, I'm happy about that. That's great. What is he
[1258.44s -> 1285.00s]  hitting me with? What's he hitting me with? What was that? All right. We're good. That was really
[1285.00s -> 1292.17s]  good play. I made sure to get the parry to get the iframes to get the kill and be invincible.
[1292.17s -> 1298.07s]  That was not a bad play. That's years of experience right there. And I know for a
[1298.07s -> 1304.12s]  fact that some of you are going to say true because it is that kind of experience with souls games
[1304.12s -> 1320.15s]  is why I just did not die. That's fine. You can troll me all you want, but that's true.
[1320.15s -> 1326.17s]  Knowing how to perfectly pixel perfect play that was only because of how many times I played souls
[1326.17s -> 1338.38s]  games. It was this peculiar stick figure. And had it even noticed how retro everything was becoming?
[1338.38s -> 1344.01s]  Of course not. It was made out of pixels. It was part of the problem. Oh, everything is like
[1344.01s -> 1364.79s]  becoming retro. Oh, wait, is this a okay. I'm starting to get it. It's an item back here.
[1364.79s -> 1385.93s]  Where was it? You saw it, right? Where was it? Did I am I losing my mind? It was like glowing on
[1385.93s -> 1411.91s]  a pedestal. What was it? Am I seeing things? No, it is right there. How do I get over there?
[1411.91s -> 1431.13s]  148 seven momentum special abilities. I mean, this thing is this thing's better. All right.
[1431.13s -> 1448.58s]  Yeah. How do I get over there? Illusory books, illusory bookcase. Take that herb. Good call.
[1455.62s -> 1470.49s]  I don't want to miss the first secret of the game. I don't get it. How do I do it?
[1470.49s -> 1482.34s]  I don't think there's no jump. Why is there no face cam on? Because I don't feel like having it on.
[1482.34s -> 1507.37s]  End of discussion. I don't think I can get in there. I'm going to miss the first secret of the
[1507.37s -> 1514.42s]  game and everyone's going to make fun of me. Oh, well, I'm going to go through here though.
[1514.42s -> 1557.46s]  Turn back. Maybe I should. Oh, everything's fine. What is that? Jesus. Fuck. That hurt a lot,
[1557.46s -> 1571.14s]  guys. That hurt a lot, man. God damn it. Oh, I didn't have enough stamina to swing again.
[1571.14s -> 1588.36s]  Oh, shit. That's not good. Oh, no. He's still in the tutorial. Oh, shit. He is actually still
[1588.36s -> 1596.41s]  in the tutorial. He's still in the tutorial. Judging by the four reactions to why there's no
[1596.41s -> 1611.35s]  face cam, there was gigachad, bald, naked, or pregnant. Okay. No, actually, back a year ago,
[1611.35s -> 1616.06s]  I never had face cam on. That was a new thing. I would put it on for horror games.
[1616.06s -> 1628.20s]  It was pretty rare. I kind of like it like this. It'll come on. You're never going to not see my
[1628.20s -> 1636.14s]  face again. Don't worry. Just like when I want to. And that's it. A year ago? No, no, no, no, no,
[1636.14s -> 1650.47s]  no, no, no. Not... All right. I mean face cam. Now you're getting me killed. Don't ever show
[1650.47s -> 1665.03s]  your face again. You're going to come back looking way different. You know, that's actually kind of
[1665.03s -> 1672.14s]  funny. I'm going to do that. Like, I hope you understand that. This is not some long, elaborate
[1672.14s -> 1676.38s]  bit to turn my face cam on in like three months and be like, I don't know, like a fat guy or
[1676.38s -> 1682.14s]  something. But you know what I mean? Like, what if I had like a fucking different haircut? I had
[1682.14s -> 1692.01s]  like different facial hair? I don't know. It might be kind of funny. Oh, stir! Raid from stir. What's
[1692.01s -> 1699.10s]  going on? Stir. Hope you're having fun in Elden Ring. I am playing a different game that looks
[1699.10s -> 1705.53s]  kind of like modded Elden Ring, doesn't it? See, I decided that like, oh no, dude, I'm not like into
[1705.53s -> 1710.25s]  playing like the modded stuff anymore. I'm going to play a video game whose sole purpose is to be
[1710.25s -> 1722.70s]  a modded Elden Ring. You know, it's like, you know, but you know how it is. Nah, thanks for the raid.
[1722.70s -> 1735.59s]  Hope you're doing good. Hope all the stir watchers are doing good. All right, this time I'm not going
[1735.59s -> 1750.04s]  to mess it up. I have enough health. I'm going to kill this mini boss. That's mean to the devs of
[1750.04s -> 1758.14s]  this game. What? No, no, no. I mean, this game is very clearly supposed to be a Dark Souls parody.
[1758.14s -> 1768.25s]  That's the whole point of this game is a Dark Souls parody. It's very good. Hey, when did I say
[1768.25s -> 1775.74s]  this wasn't fun? In fact, I'm going to tell you right now, of all the souls likes I have played,
[1775.74s -> 1796.57s]  the parody one seems to have the best first 45 minutes. I'm just saying. Ooh, there's more
[1796.57s -> 1806.38s]  over here. Oh, you played like 15 minutes. Yeah. And I'm having fun time. Now the merits of this
[1806.38s -> 1811.90s]  game are not solely to be held of it being a parody of Dark Souls. No, that's absolutely accurate.
[1812.97s -> 1818.86s]  But it's definitely initial intent intent is to get you to say, well, this is kind of like a
[1818.86s -> 1837.50s]  Dark Souls parody. Doesn't mean that it's all about that. Ooh, that was cool. Was that armor?
[1837.50s -> 1851.82s]  I don't know what that was. It is. All right, this game is way cooler than I think any of you
[1851.82s -> 1871.50s]  thought it was going to be. Is that all I have? Cool. Okay. All right. Well, I got that. Were
[1871.50s -> 1881.46s]  there any properties on this? Just physical defense. Oh, here's lore pixelating chest piece
[1881.46s -> 1887.26s]  with a target painted where the heart would lie. After I was splintered as so often as I was,
[1887.26s -> 1893.70s]  I would be taken back to the repair shop and restrung for the next encounter. I can't,
[1893.70s -> 1905.14s]  there's a memory in this thing. I think this is a sprint button, right? It has to be. What is it?
[1905.14s -> 1931.59s]  Don't even do it. Oh my goodness. I wonder if you need to break any boxes for any reason.
[1931.59s -> 1939.11s]  This happened to my buddy, Eric. That's kind of crazy. It seems like Eric's,
[1939.11s -> 1946.63s]  a lot of stuff's happening to Eric lately. It's kind of weird because it seems like, uh,
[1946.63s -> 1953.58s]  five to 10,000 of you have this friend of yours named Eric. It seems to do a lot of crazy shit.
[1953.58s -> 1955.58s]  That's kind of, all right, I'm not going to fucking lose again.
[1971.48s -> 1977.91s]  Don't talk about Eric. You don't even know him. I can't make references to Eric because he's not
[1977.91s -> 1984.62s]  my friend. Oh, I see. Dude, don't, you don't know Eric. Like why are you talking about him?
[1984.62s -> 1989.58s]  I know Eric, you don't. Stop bringing him up. You know, all right. That's true. I don't know.
[1989.58s -> 2006.26s]  I don't know Eric. You do. What? Oh, this is better. Isn't it? Is this better for me?
[2006.26s -> 2026.70s]  I'm supposed to use daggers. I'm going to stick with that. No, please. Not in the tutorial. Not
[2027.42s -> 2052.94s]  again. How do I sprint? We're good. Hold control. Ooh, the spell will consume access when you use it.
[2052.94s -> 2081.80s]  Access 119 damage and uses access. Oh, I have 20 access. Oh, I get it. Is there a door here?
[2081.80s -> 2100.20s]  Let me see a door drop down. Yeah, but I don't want to miss anything. I can go.
[2100.20s -> 2116.20s]  I don't want to miss anything. Oh, I see what you're saying. Yeah. Yep. I get it. I know. Yeah.
[2116.20s -> 2120.79s]  Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. I see. I know. I know. I know. I get you. I get you. I get you.
[2120.79s -> 2153.58s]  Intentionally frustrating fall joke. All right. Where is it at? Side is it on? Is it over here?
[2153.58s -> 2168.89s]  I don't think there's a jump. Memory of an important NPC. How do I get out of here?
[2168.89s -> 2193.91s]  Can I get out of here? Yes, I can. All right. Let's continue. Let's get out of the tutorial.
[2193.91s -> 2202.57s]  Weapon upgrades. What's the thing that I do? Oh, oh, this is this game's crunchies.
[2202.57s -> 2216.04s]  You're going to die to the first boss. I haven't gotten there yet. So just wait. I know a lot of
[2216.04s -> 2221.88s]  you are. Some of you guys have like a notepad that just has like omega low so bad on it.
[2221.88s -> 2226.54s]  So you can just go like control, control, control, control. Just so you can paste it in here. You're
[2226.54s -> 2232.30s]  ready for it. You have like a whole notepad ready, but I'm not going to die to the first boss.
[2232.30s -> 2255.34s]  So might as well clear your clipboard. Oh, that's cool. That clear, clear like your clipboard,
[2255.34s -> 2259.53s]  just clear your cache and everything. Rape some memory because you're not going to need it.
[2259.53s -> 2277.80s]  Hold down. Yeah, it doesn't. I think the world is sick and you're like final pixelated.
[2278.70s -> 2285.18s]  The narrator bowed to save the world. The narrator bowed to cut you from it. Oh,
[2286.38s -> 2296.62s]  I like the dynamic here. Left stick is sprint is. Oh, I want to make that a toggle. I know it was
[2296.62s -> 2307.19s]  in the options here somewhere. Toggle sprint. There it is. Oh no, wait a minute. Let's make
[2307.19s -> 2318.14s]  this even better. Yeah. Okay. Now that's familiar. It takes a lot of stamina. Okay. This is the first
[2318.14s -> 2324.76s]  boss. Everyone, everyone get your copy and paste ready. Transformed to an impossible adversary.
[2324.76s -> 2348.17s]  One written to crush the stick figure on site. Is there a crouch? I don't think I can crouch.
[2348.17s -> 2374.66s]  Don't give up. We need you. Okay, I got it. Staging room NPCs only. But wait, there's probably an
[2374.66s -> 2387.40s]  item. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
[2387.40s -> 2412.39s]  I don't want to. I went the wrong way. There's a whole nother area over there. Turn already.
[2412.39s -> 2431.42s]  Why am I ignoring the door? I wanted to come up here because there's an area up here that all of
[2431.42s -> 2456.76s]  heroes staging room key conduit on fire. Lay your pixels upon it. Bonfire locksmith serrated saw.
[2456.76s -> 2465.56s]  More access. Be our hero. Well, not yet. I got to go check out that other thing. There's so many
[2465.56s -> 2471.80s]  weapons already. Okay. What about like the beacon? Do I go fight that? I'm going to go fight that
[2471.80s -> 2497.72s]  thing in the middle. You're you're in the void. Are you? Oh, don't know what you are or why you're
[2497.72s -> 2513.48s]  here. Do you want me to guide you? Uh, I don't know. You are no hero and I am no travel brochure.
[2513.48s -> 2519.08s]  Now I have no idea what your little gestures were meant to convey. Probably rude, but I will tell
[2519.08s -> 2527.91s]  you what you are. Proof that nostalgia is dying. And what a stick person gesture. Can I level up?
[2527.91s -> 2538.42s]  Level up. Ah, sometimes you may want to backtrack. Tether to a beacon before you do so. Later,
[2538.42s -> 2543.14s]  when you are finished backtracking, you can warp to your tethered beacon. So allow you to pick up
[2543.14s -> 2552.47s]  where you left off. Okay. So tether here, like tether warp. Like does this count as me tethering
[2552.47s -> 2573.34s]  here? Or did I just tell it? Where did I just go? Okay. So tether. All right. Level up. What do I do?
[2573.34s -> 2580.44s]  Luck. 15 luck gets me a new ability. What should I do? I don't know. Luck. I mean,
[2580.44s -> 2603.06s]  vitality, stamina. Set your tether first. Okay. This is tethered. Let's go all luck. All in on luck.
[2603.06s -> 2619.18s]  This is such a bad idea. I want 10 stamina. What about equipment load? Yeah. All right. I'm happy
[2619.18s -> 2638.52s]  with that. I hope that was a good idea. Wait, I have crunchies too. How much does this do?
[2638.52s -> 2654.63s]  Luck only. I need 200 more. I should get it from this. What do you think? Last point in luck?
[2654.63s -> 2670.87s]  Really? It's 1100. Oh my God. We'll just kill something. There we go. Okay. Get all up. I'm
[2670.87s -> 2681.26s]  going to go kill a thing in the middle. Stamina or health. I'm going to say just get stamina up.
[2681.26s -> 2695.69s]  All right. Let's go. I'm going to go fight this fucking thing right in the middle. I'm excited.
[2695.69s -> 2707.82s]  I didn't mean to press that. Reset. Reset it. What? Why is it over here? Why is it over here?
[2707.82s -> 2723.90s]  I was not ready for this. There it is. All right. Hope you bet for me. I hoped you bet for me because
[2723.90s -> 2733.21s]  I beat it. Oh, now all of a sudden everybody's freaking out. Everybody wants to change their
[2733.21s -> 2738.89s]  bet. Yeah. Sorry. When you can't, if you're at the roulette table and it's spinning and you put it
[2738.89s -> 2752.39s]  all on black and they say no more bets. Sorry. It's so funny. I looked over and I saw the,
[2753.11s -> 2759.96s]  that was an immediate change. When it was down to like half, 20% health very quickly,
[2759.96s -> 2770.78s]  it was like 200,000 points and it jumped to like 3 million in one or two seconds. That's so stupid.
[2770.78s -> 2782.39s]  All right. First boss is down. It was so fast. That was only a moderately large enemy, dude.
[2782.39s -> 2803.19s]  All right. Now I want to go back to this thing where the key was. Okay. What the? Um,
[2803.19s -> 2821.51s]  a lot harder than I thought it was going to be. Jesus. Too many in here. There are too many in
[2821.51s -> 2848.55s]  here. Remember to smile while you stab them. Remember to occasionally miss. I like that.
[2848.55s -> 2873.51s]  So this is where they hang out. Ooh, is it a real door? It is not stable. Wait, huh? There's somebody
[2873.51s -> 2897.06s]  behind that door. All right. That's cool. It changes. It's like a, as this, okay. I like that
[2897.14s -> 2921.88s]  fireplace stone. Ooh, it's a new area, but there's more to look at out here.
[2921.88s -> 2938.63s]  Why are you playing as a Minecraft sword? I don't know. Why not? All right. So there's a new area
[2938.63s -> 2977.46s]  that way, but this behind here too, what is over here? Memory is sacred. Receive blessing. No,
[2977.46s -> 2993.19s]  the hero was rejected. Oh, that's great. I love this walk. This is, I love this. This,
[2993.19s -> 2997.80s]  this reminds me of Demon's Souls, the music of what do I do? So I wait for a swing.
[2999.30s -> 3023.99s]  That hurt a lot. Can I parry it? He's doing the yanky splanky. Did it work? I'm not taking damage,
[3023.99s -> 3037.59s]  but it's not working. All right. Well, I don't think I can. Oops. This music is great.
[3045.21s -> 3050.66s]  I tried to dodge it. It didn't work. I'm dodging and it didn't work.
[3051.38s -> 3076.87s]  The spirit had a final. Jesus. It's so long. Fuck. All right. I get it. It's not, it's not hard.
[3076.87s -> 3096.04s]  It's just that here it comes. Boss fights require timing and patience. At first it might seem like
[3096.04s -> 3103.35s]  there's no safe time to attack, but if you pay attention, a window will open. I think I'm going,
[3103.35s -> 3112.95s]  we're going Axe. I can't parry it. You just got Luigi. No, I got a tutorial message. There's a
[3112.95s -> 3131.40s]  difference. Fuck. It reminds me of the, okay. I pressed it. I pressed dodge. What the hell?
[3135.94s -> 3171.88s]  There we go. All right. The spirit had a final form. A final form. Oh my God. He went to kick me.
[3172.44s -> 3205.93s]  He got way harder. Fuck. Oh, all right. You got to be a little early. Ooh, the crits happen randomly.
[3206.57s -> 3243.83s]  I like it. Let's go. This is fun. Wait, that might not be it. Finish him. Huh? Shield of inspiration.
[3243.83s -> 3256.70s]  You did it. These extra tutorial messages will now stop. The last hero of nostalgia is a mystery.
[3256.70s -> 3262.60s]  What are you? What happened to this world? What is expected of you? You won't be handed the answers.
[3263.16s -> 3284.76s]  Can you uncover them? This game is cool. That music was good too. Yeah. Time to blow up this
[3284.76s -> 3298.89s]  whole character and ruin it and have to start over in like an hour. You can't go wrong with
[3298.89s -> 3306.01s]  vitality and stamina until I figure out what I want. I don't know. I'm too scared to do anything.
[3306.01s -> 3325.21s]  Up strength a little. Let me just hold on. Let me see what I got. Did I get anything new? Attribute
[3325.21s -> 3334.70s]  bonus. Dexterity 1.1, 2.3, 2, 2.2. So this is the biggest scaling then. Luck influences crits,
[3334.70s -> 3338.81s]  so that might, that stat might actually be really good. It seemed like it was pretty good.
[3339.45s -> 3358.63s]  So this is just a better shield. It's bigger. Is there anything else on it? Stability, weight,
[3358.63s -> 3368.92s]  physical. This is 100% physical damage reduction. Oh, there's no parry anymore. I'm the parry class.
[3368.92s -> 3392.44s]  Fuck. I don't know what to do. Saw. This thing's pretty good. Ooh, two handed. Pretty good too.
[3392.44s -> 3407.51s]  Oh, it's a key. All right. I have to make a choice and that choice is to be a coward and just do
[3407.51s -> 3414.31s]  stamina and health until I figure out what the hell I'm doing. Coward plays, but it's all right.
[3414.31s -> 3439.90s]  Yeah, it's always good. It's never a bad idea. Art flow alter. The pixel art and the not pixel
[3439.90s -> 3446.78s]  art. I like the style of this game. It was undeniable that the scattered bundle of sticks
[3446.78s -> 3455.10s]  remained pathetic, but something was amiss. The narrator never confused was curious.
[3456.78s -> 3462.47s]  There's also that other way too. What class am I playing? I'm playing the luck. I forget
[3462.47s -> 3470.65s]  what this class is named. It's called like random, random class, random master or something. Yeah.
[3470.65s -> 3488.86s]  I'm going to go explore that other area. You're fat rolling right now. There is fat rolling. Okay.
[3488.86s -> 3494.90s]  Well, what is actually doing more damage? I think I'm going to stay with the yeah. I'm going to stay
[3494.90s -> 3513.82s]  with the ax. I'm so pumped for this playthrough. Yeah. I mean, how long is this game? I'm just
[3513.82s -> 3527.62s]  going to run. It's about 15. That's cool. I'm just going to play it until I don't really care anymore.
[3527.62s -> 3531.43s]  Maybe I'll beat it. It seems interesting enough to continue to play.
[3534.66s -> 3544.36s]  It's definitely got me. I have been gotten. The game has grabbed my attention for sure. NPC city.
[3544.36s -> 3594.94s]  Don't even get over here. Oh my God. Stop. Stop. NPC city. Descend quickly is B. Is there a jump?
[3594.94s -> 3621.58s]  I don't think so. Oh, these are weird. That really hurt. All right. Ladders back there. Blood of
[3621.58s -> 3640.52s]  nostalgia. Are there bonfires? There are. How mad are you that you guys just voted for a regular
[3640.52s -> 3653.46s]  ass enemy? Cause wait, no, this is back. Wait, where am I? This is that other room. That hurt a lot.
[3653.46s -> 3661.75s]  Okay. It's too bad you didn't vote this time. I actually did try to dodge and it didn't work.
[3661.75s -> 3679.16s]  I pressed. I, I wouldn't have just sat there. I promise. He dodged into it. You know what I
[3679.16s -> 3686.18s]  think it is? This game has freeze frame when you get hit. So it's, what's probably happening is
[3686.18s -> 3692.06s]  because the freeze frame of being hit is overriding your dodge. So there are frames
[3692.06s -> 3697.90s]  for being hit. Therefore, if it's not perfect, you're going to get that frame from hit damage.
[3697.90s -> 3705.16s]  Right? Interesting stuff. Cause there is freeze hits, but what did I get from doing that? I mean,
[3705.16s -> 3725.00s]  I opened the door, but that really do anything for me today. I learned when you get hit, you can't
[3725.00s -> 3731.02s]  dodge. Well, no, I'm just saying like the game has freeze hits. You know what I mean? But I think
[3731.10s -> 3736.49s]  you know what I mean? Freeze damage. When you get hit, the whole game goes for like one second,
[3736.49s -> 3759.72s]  like half a second. So what was down here that I could do? I hate these things already. No,
[3759.72s -> 3771.35s]  stop. Okay. I'm fine. Yeah. The ladder will take me back up, but what was the point of coming down
[3771.35s -> 3778.07s]  here in the first place? Just to open up this shortcut. But for what? I guess if you keep
[3778.07s -> 3793.16s]  dying to the boss, is it just for fun? Check the doors. It looks like I couldn't open any of them.
[3793.16s -> 3801.72s]  I don't think I can open any of these. I think it's just to teach you that shortcuts exist and
[3801.72s -> 3810.54s]  that they can be used. Or I mean, maybe this opens later. This right here, like the sewers or
[3810.54s -> 3815.13s]  something. I don't know. Yeah, it's probably for later. Oh, I'm just going to run. I don't want
[3815.13s -> 3825.11s]  to fight this thing. I, uh, I ran the way that I should not have run. Wait, wait, wait, wait,
[3825.11s -> 3830.14s]  wait, wait, wait. Is this different? Wait, what's happening? Where am I? Is this, this is, is this,
[3830.14s -> 3846.10s]  no, this is different. Where am I going? This is the beginning of the whole game. All right. I'm
[3846.18s -> 3854.47s]  running this way. So there really is no purpose to that. And this is just later. Maybe just,
[3854.47s -> 3860.68s]  you know, I might just die. I'm imagining like there was a purpose to that opening that,
[3860.68s -> 3885.91s]  but I guess there is none. I can't run up that. Uh, I'm going to die here. Maybe not. You can do
[3885.91s -> 3908.98s]  it. Uh, yeah, it's over here. Did I just seriously run all the way back down? But wait a minute. No.
[3908.98s -> 3916.74s]  Okay. Yeah. I was like, what the fuck is happening right now? Well, there is no point to that. How
[3916.74s -> 3930.17s]  come there's no point? It's just like a little Easter egg. Where are we? We made it back here.
[3930.17s -> 3934.98s]  This is, I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. Oh, I can't cheese it. I have to fight everything
[3934.98s -> 3944.38s]  that's aggroed. Oh, that's not good. At least I'll end up right here. What is he on about?
[3944.38s -> 3948.14s]  I opened up like a door over there and it went down to like the, yeah, you're,
[3948.14s -> 3959.34s]  you're here. What do you mean? You're literally watching. I just did it. Okay. It's damn enough.
[3962.39s -> 3977.14s]  Lost Larry. Quiet. I had my eyes closed because I was scared. Oh, all right. I'm sorry, man.
[3977.14s -> 3986.54s]  I didn't mean to say that. You got the secrets all over games like this. You have to be prepared
[3986.54s -> 4006.20s]  for running around in circles. All right. There's a bonfire. Secrets looks climbable. Doesn't it?
[4011.53s -> 4052.09s]  Well, is this a, Oh, should I kill him? Not going to kill him. Yeah. All right. Tether.
[4055.26s -> 4066.31s]  So this is a warp. That's cool. Okay. What does return icon mean? Look up what you have restored
[4066.31s -> 4076.95s]  by your touch. A hero is known by their actions. Yes. Oh yeah. I know what you are or rather
[4076.95s -> 4087.69s]  what you might prove to be. You do not yourself though. Memory of what was is vanishing,
[4087.69s -> 4094.41s]  but do not despair through your journey. You may yet discover your nature.
[4094.97s -> 4102.41s]  Your touch upon this beacon has caused a remembering of what was that jagged blade.
[4102.41s -> 4108.73s]  You scavenged. Can you, can you hear its whisper rummage through your belongings and find it?
[4109.37s -> 4121.42s]  R1, R1, R1. Okay. Item description. This relic has a pixelating memory.
[4122.50s -> 4127.78s]  If you can help the relic remember, it will get stronger. The location of its memory could be
[4127.78s -> 4134.20s]  anywhere in the world. Relics in the correct location will quiver in your inventory. To find
[4134.20s -> 4140.84s]  the location, listen to what it tells you. See how this relic mentions an old man? Try standing
[4140.84s -> 4148.81s]  beside the old man, selecting this relic and choosing remember. Oh, that's just kind of cool.
[4149.45s -> 4167.42s]  Spin slash. Holy shit. As you remember different relics, you will gain permanent insight bonuses.
[4167.98s -> 4173.98s]  That's highly advantage, a lot of advantage to remembering relics, even if you don't equip them.
[4173.98s -> 4188.92s]  See your player status screen for your insight bonuses. Okay. But now this is just better. Cool.
[4192.92s -> 4199.48s]  Feared such depth to be lost forever. You may be whom I've been waiting for.
[4200.20s -> 4209.64s]  Nostalgia is dying. The great forgetting is taking us all into pixelization and then
[4211.45s -> 4218.55s]  oblivion. Heroes, the great ones, most especially were meant to save Nostalgia,
[4218.55s -> 4224.87s]  but they have forsaken their purpose. They now choke the arteries meant to carry memory back
[4224.87s -> 4232.47s]  into our world's heart. I remember their failures, but I shall not lecture you who they were and what
[4232.47s -> 4239.67s]  they did was to be yours to discover, yours to make meaning from. The first great one wails
[4239.67s -> 4247.51s]  from within the depths of Nostalgia's memory. Oh, the big bad ones. Oh, you got the gate open for
[4247.51s -> 4257.69s]  me. Thank you. Oh, no. Why? Oh, you think you're stronger than me. Oh, they always did that. It was
[4257.69s -> 4263.75s]  so fun. They would all be like, please stop it. What are you? Oh, so it's a fight you want.
[4271.24s -> 4279.88s]  You have one item that can be remembered here. Increase. I need to wait. I do. Did I already do
[4279.88s -> 4305.21s]  it? These moving? I don't think so. Okay. Um, let's just go. Heart of a hero, heart of a hero's touch,
[4305.21s -> 4320.14s]  heart of a hero's path. Like starter gear. Oh, 22. This relic's memory yearns to be found.
[4320.14s -> 4325.50s]  New heroes were once tutorialized that the heart of heroism is not gold and glitter,
[4326.14s -> 4331.34s]  pomp and celebration, but humility and ultimately sacrifice. They were taught how to give back to
[4331.34s -> 4358.07s]  nostalgia. So I got to go to the tutorial room, look to its heart. Okay. Heart of a hero. I go
[4358.07s -> 4368.60s]  to the tutorial room. He was like, Oh, tutorials are very interesting. Maybe that'll do it.
[4377.91s -> 4384.33s]  Memory lingers in an undiscovered location is that's what it would say, right? Undiscovered
[4384.33s -> 4389.72s]  region. Undo. Okay. Okay. Yep. Yep. Yep. All right. Let's go. That's an, I like that mechanic.
[4390.60s -> 4411.24s]  Remembering ahead. Wait, is this real? People putting those down? All right. That's cool.
[4411.24s -> 4433.86s]  What the hell is this? Peer down. Do I want to do that? Remember offense. Message box. Yeah,
[4433.86s -> 4442.28s]  it is in the game. You, it is styles. Just heart is constricted. Barely any memory goes in or comes
[4442.28s -> 4462.52s]  out. I got to repair this. No style Gaia. And so at an old man's behest, the stick figure raised
[4462.52s -> 4471.24s]  its frail limbs to limply push onward. The hero's journey too arduous for its meager pixels would
[4471.24s -> 4481.00s]  prove a humanist bad guy. How do I do the slash? It's like a spinning slash, right?
[4484.02s -> 4501.69s]  Spin slash. How do I do it? Okay. It's, uh, L two. These are a lot of, um, Oh God. All right. The
[4501.69s -> 4510.94s]  scale of the game was very small up until five seconds ago. Suddenly lust. I'm not reading all
[4510.94s -> 4538.82s]  these. So it's pretty good. Soon the walking scribble would understand all that was lost.
[4538.82s -> 4555.43s]  This is our Dark Souls one. What is it called? That area with, uh, the capper demon undead
[4555.43s -> 4565.38s]  burg. Yeah. That's what it reminds me of. Yeah. I'm dumping every point in the luck. I'll be
[4565.38s -> 4575.94s]  cutting it like a 30 to 40% rate. Why does this actually look fun as hell? Cause it is, it is,
[4577.21s -> 4587.48s]  it is fun. Luring ahead. Oh, there's only one rating on this. Worship village. You carry one
[4587.48s -> 4607.40s]  relic that can be remembered ahead. Yep. Oh my God. That's so many people. Oh,
[4637.56s -> 4652.12s]  cool. That was a lot, um, scarier than it was hard. Get your quest and leave.
[4653.66s -> 4682.26s]  Keep moving. What's going on here? Hello. That was a very loud sounding monster. What is that?
[4686.98s -> 4717.46s]  Okay. Well we got to go in there. Jesus. Okay. Don't fucking die here. Dab on them, dude.
[4719.08s -> 4726.89s]  I'm working on it. I don't want to, I have funny heels and I don't want to reset the area. So I'm
[4726.89s -> 4754.02s]  going to, not going to do that yet. The windows are frowning there. They are a little room. Wait.
[4754.02s -> 4788.87s]  Oh, wait a minute. Don't go there. Okay. No, out of stamina. Fuck. That's a lot of hurt.
[4788.87s -> 4806.01s]  All right. The rolling, uh, the rolling is fine. Unlocked somewhere else. All right. I am not going
[4806.01s -> 4809.61s]  to remember any of this. So I hope people in chat are paying attention because I'm not going to,
[4809.61s -> 4823.69s]  I won't know. Just, I hope there's at least one person here keeping a, a log of every single
[4823.69s -> 4830.22s]  place that my character is gone. I know there's somebody in here doing it because I'm just kind
[4830.22s -> 4834.86s]  of wandering. And it's, that's always a bad thing to do in games like this, but I'm all right.
[4836.07s -> 4850.74s]  I'm going to turn around after this, dude. Everyone is too high to do that. I don't think
[4850.74s -> 4874.95s]  that's accurate. I can do that too. You know, nice. All right. So far so good.
[4880.12s -> 4905.94s]  Hmm. How did I not hit you? All right. I'm going to turn around. Just one more of these rooms.
[4907.00s -> 4941.50s]  Fireplace stone. Yes. Prickly mirror. What was that? Prickly mirror code is a spell.
[4941.50s -> 4955.66s]  Your stats are too low to use this. Oh, I need whatever that is. Uh, all right. So that's a
[4955.66s -> 4992.36s]  spell. Well, cool. You don't matter. Is that elevator? Weird. Okay. I'm not jumping in there.
[4992.36s -> 5017.74s]  I'm not jumping in there. It's treasure in there. You don't know that. I'll come back later. You
[5017.74s -> 5024.79s]  loser. I didn't, I didn't do the thing you wanted me to do. All right. I'm coming out here now
[5024.79s -> 5028.47s]  where I could go the other way. You know what? All right. I gotta, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta,
[5028.47s -> 5035.38s]  I gotta, I gotta get out of here. I'm not doing this. I have to go, um, I gotta go this way and
[5035.38s -> 5043.67s]  then I gotta go down. I'm going to that bonfire that was out here. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no. I got
[5043.67s -> 5069.02s]  3,500 memory. I haven't even turned this on yet. So is it decks? I wonder if it's decks or just,
[5069.82s -> 5088.94s]  I already made the decision and it was probably wrong. All right. So I could go over here.
[5089.98s -> 5102.01s]  Oh, I can remember here. What can I remember? I don't see anything shaking.
[5108.44s -> 5121.67s]  No, it'd be in the way. We have to go in here. This is right. Come on. Are we not going in here?
[5121.67s -> 5132.89s]  It's not even real. Oh, it's a, it's a way for you to die, but they were in the middle of their NPC
[5132.89s -> 5139.00s]  route and they didn't see me. It's bait for you to get killed by these, but they were all the way
[5139.00s -> 5159.96s]  at the bottom of their cycle. It's bad. I'm going to die down here. No, I'm dead. All right. So let
[5159.96s -> 5179.32s]  me, let me try this again. Do a weed pole. No, I don't care. I don't care if you're high or not.
[5179.32s -> 5195.43s]  High avoid enemy. Oh, I should have read these enemies ahead. No, that's yeah. Hey, look,
[5195.43s -> 5201.19s]  that's between you and, and you. That's not, I don't have to do with me. I don't need to know
[5201.19s -> 5215.38s]  that item down here. Why would I avoid these enemies when there's an item at the bottom?
[5215.46s -> 5247.24s]  Oh, not it's worth it. Trust me. He hates people that use weed. Oh, it's, I can't do it. And
[5247.24s -> 5260.41s]  suddenly I can't do it. Oh, nothing here though. I can't go in there. Classic.
[5268.55s -> 5273.16s]  Well, at least we got to see it. Okay. So I'm going to go up or I don't know,
[5277.54s -> 5308.41s]  maybe I'll try to fight that little mini boss. Legend of independence used for weapon upgrades.
[5308.41s -> 5319.37s]  Okay. All right. I'm going to go for it. Let's fight this thing and I hope I can do it. Well,
[5319.37s -> 5329.62s]  try remembering. Oh, thanks for the cheating. Oh, they were full of shit. Okay. Wait,
[5329.62s -> 5357.40s]  they mean inside suddenly annoying enemy. Oh, they're lying. Okay. Oh, that hurt. Can we,
[5357.40s -> 5365.37s]  so somebody's, can we please do an allergy poll? Okay. Yeah. How many people here are allergic
[5365.37s -> 5371.13s]  to peanuts? That sounds fun. That's not really fun, but how many people are allergic to peanuts
[5371.13s -> 5402.26s]  in chat? Ooh, just an unassuming and insignificant house. I look cool. Are you allergic to peanuts?
[5405.62s -> 5434.78s]  Really? Okay. So luck bonuses, critical hits, extra item from pickups, 25% damage for 30 seconds on
[5434.78s -> 5450.26s]  attack. What? So this is milestones for luck. Two times memory healing costs nothing. All right.
[5450.26s -> 5458.86s]  This game's pretty cool. Uh, 95%. Okay. So 5% of the audience here is allergic to peanuts.
[5459.42s -> 5467.30s]  That's kind of interesting. Uh, all right. I'm going to go up or should I,
[5468.02s -> 5476.42s]  maybe I'll go this way because there's a way to go. No, I went this way before. I'm going to go
[5476.42s -> 5492.78s]  here. I'm just going to rest and then go up. What about shellfish? Uh, yeah. How many people here
[5492.78s -> 5506.12s]  are allergic to shellfish? 5% peanut allergy, Andy's. Why did I say it like that? I was trying
[5506.12s -> 5529.06s]  to think of like a way to say that. That was like such a dumb way to say that. Allergy, Andy's.
[5530.46s -> 5543.46s]  You know, thankfully I am not allergic to anything that I know of. All right. This is strength.
[5544.02s -> 5554.15s]  Cool looking though. Can't get in here. Well, cause I was trying to figure out like if people
[5554.15s -> 5560.63s]  that have, I wanted to say people that have peanut allergies, but I said peanut allergies
[5560.63s -> 5565.67s]  first. So I was like, Oh wow. Like we have a lot of people who are allergic to peanuts,
[5565.67s -> 5571.10s]  but I said we have peanut. Oh, I already said the first, I already said it.
[5571.10s -> 5580.58s]  So how do I fix that mid sentence? 5% again. Damn. Okay. So where's game progress?
[5586.42s -> 5596.20s]  Nice game progress over here. No, I came from over here. Where is game progress?
[5601.26s -> 5616.62s]  Up from where I was. Cause that's blocked. Do lactose intolerance. Do lactose intolerance.
[5623.48s -> 5631.22s]  All right. All right. All right. Game progress. I wish I could close this door. All right. Wait,
[5631.22s -> 5638.82s]  wait, wait, wait. You know, I feel like lactose intolerance is going to be pretty high.
[5643.06s -> 5663.46s]  All right. One more. Are you lactose intolerant? Oh, oh my God. What a disaster. Oh, this is it.
[5676.76s -> 5692.97s]  Nope. All right. I know where to go. I know where to go. This pole is weird. This is a goofy pole.
[5696.10s -> 5704.84s]  Is it? I don't think it's that goofy. Nice goofy ass pole. All right. I'm not going to aggro the
[5704.84s -> 5713.14s]  entire instance. I'm going to sit down again. These, you got to dodge. Okay. These things are
[5713.14s -> 5720.81s]  hard because dodging back doesn't help. I got to dodge right. And then you get put lined up. No,
[5720.81s -> 5729.37s]  how do I, that's a shitload of people that have lacked homelands. 25%. 26% is lactose intolerant.
[5730.89s -> 5734.57s]  I just lost those souls, but this is an incredibly eye-opening experience to see this.
[5735.21s -> 5751.48s]  25% said lactose intolerant. Jesus. That's a lot. I actually, I haven't had that much
[5751.48s -> 5756.44s]  milk. And you know, I'm full of shit and I know I'm full of shit. So I can tell you that before
[5756.44s -> 5761.64s]  we talk about this, but I'm one of the, well, let's be real. I'm going to be honest. So I'm
[5761.64s -> 5766.28s]  one of those people that says, I don't take in that much dairy. Like, no, I don't take in that
[5766.28s -> 5771.40s]  much dairy anymore. You know, I, I, oat milk, I drink oat milk and I put oat milk in my coffee.
[5771.40s -> 5776.44s]  I still eat a shitload of cheese. I still eat a ton of fucking ice cream. I'm full of shit.
[5780.84s -> 5786.44s]  Right. And it sucks. And I, cause I really do want, you know, I, I try to get you,
[5787.24s -> 5791.80s]  and I don't want to, I want to, I am eating, I'm trying to eat better, you know, trying to
[5791.80s -> 5798.79s]  get cut out dairy, dairy is just, I don't know, it feels like bad for my skin and, but how do you,
[5798.79s -> 5804.07s]  how do you replace cheese? Like how? And I've tried the cheese alternatives and they are not good.
[5804.79s -> 5818.82s]  They are not good. Let's be real. I've tried a bunch of them, a sharp cheddar cheese,
[5819.96s -> 5825.69s]  Oh my God. Like I, you, I don't, it can never be replaced. If they figure it out, I'm willing to
[5825.69s -> 5832.09s]  try. I am. I'm very willing to try it, but like an extremely sharp cheddar cheese. Oh, no, I,
[5832.09s -> 5850.55s]  it's can't, it's, it's irreplaceable. I'd like to play the game now. Okay. Cheese is addictive.
[5854.84s -> 5866.26s]  Yeah. I mean, I could, I could see that. It just tastes so good, but milk, I don't know.
[5867.34s -> 5871.34s]  If there's one thing that I can tell you that I have absolutely completely cut out of my entire
[5871.34s -> 5879.58s]  diet, it's just, it's regular milk. It's just, no, no thanks. Something about it now, even like
[5879.58s -> 5894.66s]  kind of grosses me out. Like I still eat meat and everything. Like, I don't know. Just eat what you
[5894.66s -> 5899.14s]  like. I'm just trying to be conscious of just, you know, just be conscious and all things in
[5899.14s -> 5904.81s]  moderation. Ben Frank, Ben Franklin was the smartest fucking person to ever live. I've said that a
[5904.81s -> 5910.09s]  thousand times on this stream and Franklin smartest man ever. So listen to Ben Franklin, all things
[5910.09s -> 5914.65s]  in moderation. Don't eat steak every day and have it, have it when you feel like it. You don't have
[5914.65s -> 5919.45s]  to eat it every single day. Don't chug milk every day. You, Ben Franklin wouldn't have done that.
[5921.43s -> 5930.18s]  Item ahead. Watch me like Ben Franklin was like a huge proponent of drinking milk every day.
[5933.54s -> 5939.69s]  All things in moderation, except of course for milk. All Americans should be drinking at least
[5939.69s -> 5946.09s]  two gallons of milk a day. And those of you that disagree off, I'm dead. I got to pay attention.
[5949.91s -> 5960.58s]  No, I'm not going to read that because I disagree. Ben Franklin is no, I refuse to say it because I
[5960.58s -> 5966.36s]  don't believe you. I don't believe it. I refuse to say it. No, I'm not even going to manifest that.
[5969.30s -> 5973.38s]  No, I'm not going to even manifest it because no, I've refused to give that. I'm not going to even
[5973.38s -> 5982.87s]  say that. I will say it. Okay, fine. All right. Ben Franklin is not in hell. The person that said
[5982.87s -> 5987.75s]  that time them up for five minutes. You said Ben Franklin's in hell and no, I'm sorry. I don't
[5987.75s -> 5992.41s]  believe you. Why is Ben Franklin? No, I said it out loud. Now I don't know what to do.
[5994.44s -> 6001.16s]  No, that's not real. Nope. Ben Franklin's not in hell. I have 1500 souls on the ground
[6001.16s -> 6014.31s]  and you've lost them. You lost him. I didn't. Benjamin Franklin had a milk punch. He was a
[6014.31s -> 6024.31s]  milk punch aficionado. It serves 12 people, six cups of brandy, 11 lemons, two cups lemon juice,
[6024.31s -> 6030.47s]  four cups water, three fourths cups sugar, one whole nutmeg, plus extra nutmeg for garnish,
[6030.47s -> 6036.31s]  three cups whole milk, one remove peel from all 11 lemons with a vegetable peeler, taking care
[6036.31s -> 6046.31s]  to remove only the yellow part. So he like, all right, but he probably, all right, but he probably
[6046.31s -> 6053.19s]  only drank like two glasses of that. He got to the end of one. He was like, ah, that was delicious.
[6053.99s -> 6060.87s]  I guess I'll have another delicious milk punch. Okay. Ah, that's another milk punch down.
[6060.87s -> 6065.43s]  I've had enough. All things in moderation. And he just dumped the rest down the sink or something.
[6065.43s -> 6070.49s]  You know what I mean? Or he like, he like gave it to other people. He like gave it to like a bunch
[6070.49s -> 6080.71s]  of other people. He didn't drink at all. All things in moderation. He's in hell. He's in hell.
[6081.67s -> 6085.43s]  So it's no, I got to play this game. I got to play this game.
[6096.42s -> 6134.31s]  He's in hell. Okay. I need to fucking relax. I need to pull if he's in hell or not.
[6135.27s -> 6139.43s]  Fine. The last poll you're going to get the whole night is Ben Franklin in hell.
[6140.31s -> 6160.68s]  Yes or no. 11 lemons and two cups of lemon juice. What? Yeah. What a weird fucking recipe.
[6160.76s -> 6181.05s]  I do not. I do. I would say, do not drink that. Why did we get here? We were just asking if you
[6181.05s -> 6186.09s]  had a peanut allergy. Now, now we need to, now we're talking about Ben Franklin in hell.
[6187.27s -> 6192.46s]  No. All right. So 5% of you have a peanut allergy. That's interesting stuff. That's
[6192.46s -> 6199.37s]  interesting stuff. All right. Some of you got peanut allergy, which I wonder what I've always
[6199.37s -> 6209.13s]  wondered what that was potentially like. All right. This is weirdly like out of place.
[6209.77s -> 6229.64s]  I'm slow. Oh, it's a poison. Okay. Yes. What the fuck? Okay. Yeah. Ben Franklin is definitely at
[6229.64s -> 6246.26s]  least in purgatory. I love how somebody just said it has been ruled. What? Why we don't get to decide
[6246.26s -> 6269.67s]  that? What do you mean it has been ruled? Democracy, just democracy manifests. Can't believe it.
[6269.67s -> 6286.89s]  Nice crit. It's what Ben Franklin would have wanted. Ben Franklin could be sitting on like a cloud
[6286.89s -> 6293.11s]  somewhere and like God just kind of knocks on the door. Hey, Ben, don't want to interrupt or
[6293.11s -> 6298.15s]  anything, but there seems to be a poll going on in this weird fucking weirdos channel.
[6299.05s -> 6303.93s]  German nine, eight, five, but probably you'd never heard of them before. But, um, so they're voting
[6303.93s -> 6308.52s]  to determine whether you go to hell or whether you're in hell or not. And kind of have to,
[6308.52s -> 6324.30s]  I mean, you know, democracy manifests, right? God watches German. No, whatever. Nice family guy bit.
[6324.94s -> 6331.58s]  Hey, other, other pieces of media can reference God talking to people in purgatory. Okay. It's not
[6331.58s -> 6337.77s]  his family guy, although that is a, that would happen on family guy. It'd be like, God, if you're
[6337.77s -> 6344.50s]  like, Hey, excuse me, Benjamin Franklin, whatever. Like, you don't act like you didn't laugh at a
[6344.50s -> 6348.87s]  family guy joke before. Don't act like you never laughed at family guy. You're full of fucking,
[6348.87s -> 6353.67s]  you're full of baloney. You're full of baloney. I know you're full of baloney. You have laughed at
[6353.67s -> 6362.39s]  a family guy joke before. You're full of baloney. And yes, ironic Peter Griffin memes count. Ironic
[6362.39s -> 6389.80s]  Peter Griffin memes count. You're full of baloney. Okay. So where do I go? Great one. Family guy has
[6389.80s -> 6400.25s]  good jokes, but a lot of bad ones. Sure. But you still laughed at it at time. And you just,
[6400.25s -> 6408.71s]  you can't stand it. He was sitting there on the couch and it was like, Oh Lois, remember the time
[6408.71s -> 6415.02s]  that I met Ben Franklin in hell and it played out. And you went and covered your mouth. I'm like,
[6415.02s -> 6434.36s]  fuck. No, no. Um, okay. Let me, what's the, all right. Time to do what I do and not pay attention
[6434.36s -> 6452.54s]  for like half an hour. Interesting. Armor ahead. Should I just delete these? I always had these
[6452.54s -> 6469.13s]  off during from software games because I feel like it's kind of cheating. All right. This guy's scary.
[6471.75s -> 6480.65s]  That hurts so much. Oh my God. Where is this? Where is this? I don't remember. I got hit and
[6480.65s -> 6497.98s]  I got killed in three hits. I'm going to run. I'm going to try to remember where that was
[6497.98s -> 6540.26s]  as best as I can. Yep. Okay. Then it was this way and then in here. All right. Do not follow me.
[6540.26s -> 6569.62s]  Open the gate. I will after this. Why is it on his head? Wow. No, we're not doing no more
[6569.62s -> 6576.20s]  pull. We're not doing any more pulls. Master chef, fireplace stone. Oh yeah. I just got a whole
[6576.20s -> 6604.09s]  new set of gear. Cuts and scrapes. This thing's probably heavy. This thing is very heavy. Yeah.
[6604.09s -> 6622.86s]  I'm overburdened right now. I think this is good gear for now. Anything else? Anything pulsing?
[6622.86s -> 6638.23s]  He hates us. I don't. I just healed because he said that. Memory of an important NPC. Watch
[6638.23s -> 6653.27s]  out for the NPC. What had its story been? What telling had spawned it? Well, I definitely don't
[6653.27s -> 6673.56s]  want to do that right now. Nostalgia did not want it. I just got a new weapon. 93 plus 67.
[6673.56s -> 6691.37s]  This thing's better. Higher crit too. I'm going to put the buckler on because I want to be able
[6691.37s -> 6712.31s]  to parry. Well, I'm not doing that right now. I just made a quiche with half and half. You know
[6712.31s -> 6719.06s]  what's funny about quiches? I feel like I've never seen anyone make a quiche. They just sort of appear
[6719.06s -> 6724.31s]  randomly during the year at random holidays. I've never seen somebody make one. It's just like, oh,
[6724.31s -> 6732.15s]  there's a quiche on this table. I've never seen anyone make it. It's like, oh, it's a quiche. Oh,
[6732.15s -> 6746.41s]  okay. All right. All right. Cool. Quiche is gross. I disagree. I think default quiche is not great.
[6746.41s -> 6760.42s]  Yeah, bacon. Ham quiche is really good. Ham and cheese quiche.
[6760.42s -> 6762.63s]  Broccoli too. Oh yeah, that's good.
[6783.96s -> 6795.85s]  Oops. Wow. He didn't even need the bench. This is him just completely asserting how strong
[6795.85s -> 6833.99s]  of a character he really is. Okay. 20 luck. I have multiple crunchies. What do you think?
[6835.37s -> 6844.55s]  Dexterity? If I'm going to be using quick fast daggers, it has to be dexterity. Dexterity, luck
[6844.55s -> 6862.86s]  or vitality. Luck only? No, let's do health. All right. Now I'm going to go fight over the
[6862.86s -> 6893.96s]  hell that thing is. Okay. And then it was this way, right? And then, uh, uh, uh, uh, found it.
[6893.96s -> 6942.81s]  Well, that's absolutely a boss. Are we knocking? Hey, wing. Oh my God. What?
[6960.60s -> 6966.36s]  He almost just killed me. A hero did come, but not the one you wanted.
[6984.78s -> 6996.12s]  Is there, be you a hero, my beloved. One's in the chat if you know what that is. Friend ahead.
[6996.12s -> 7005.24s]  Okay. No, no, no. I, I cannot let you in. I, I love everything. My stars. We cannot risk it.
[7006.04s -> 7014.97s]  No, no, no. Yes. Should you come upon something with which I could restrain myself in your
[7014.97s -> 7023.37s]  presence, uh, uh, a manacle or a shack of some fidelity. Bring it to me so I shan't
[7025.29s -> 7034.74s]  unduly. Then I would open my door and serve you. What? No, no, no. Bring then.
[7036.02s -> 7065.85s]  How about I just put a fucking land mine right here? How would you do that? I don't know. Ooh,
[7065.85s -> 7085.11s]  the Smith's hammer. Such waste. What did you find? Are you a hero? I'm an apprentice Smith.
[7085.11s -> 7090.95s]  Oh, I was meant to be. I've sought some memory of Nostalgaia's craft in tradition, but
[7092.15s -> 7098.66s]  all I've found is forgotten with no masters to teach me. I'll never become a Smith,
[7101.11s -> 7107.83s]  but you could work on my gear. That ain't no crude tool friend. It's the Smith's hammer,
[7107.83s -> 7113.91s]  the instrument of Nostalgaia's greatest crafts folk. Any apprentice would know it,
[7113.91s -> 7120.71s]  even in its current state. A shame it don't remember itself, but that ain't no crude tool.
[7126.07s -> 7147.70s]  It can remember. Remember overhead smash, increased damage to armored. Can you use this now?
[7152.01s -> 7168.84s]  Jesus. How? What did you do? I ain't worthy. I'll do my utmost to honor and
[7169.64s -> 7177.16s]  carry forth our traditions. The hammer has bound itself to me or bound me to it.
[7177.16s -> 7186.54s]  My skills are meager. Should you find a workable anvil, you can use this relic to summon me.
[7186.54s -> 7197.03s]  I'll improve your arms best I can. The Smith's hammer is the greatest
[7197.03s -> 7203.43s]  relic of Nostalgaia's crafts folk, transcending all who swing it. It's the primordial repository
[7203.43s -> 7211.32s]  of our art. Such legacy. Of course it still clings to some memory. Throughout the cycles,
[7211.32s -> 7216.20s]  each of Nostalgaia's masters wielded the hammer to enhance relics for our heroes.
[7216.20s -> 7219.56s]  I've always longed to be a smith, to be a part of that.
[7225.30s -> 7230.98s]  Miners in the cliffs above Orsha, once excavated and readied great repositories of all.
[7230.98s -> 7235.06s]  Lore. Should you find an anvil there, with enough fidelity for my craft,
[7235.06s -> 7238.74s]  limited as my skills may be, might even find a lingering master there.
[7238.74s -> 7244.82s]  Ain't much likely, but a little hope is something. Miners in Shulim might aim us.
[7244.90s -> 7246.74s]  Wait, it's the same, hold on.
[7254.47s -> 7258.07s]  It's the same, right? Miners in Shulim might aim us.
[7258.07s -> 7263.94s]  Oh no, the chuckle is at the end. It's part of the last. Oh, it's different. It is different.
[7263.94s -> 7299.50s]  Okay, well, sliver of tradition. You can do it. Try love. All right, try patience.
[7300.22s -> 7316.26s]  How about you stop? All right, this thing's gonna move, right? We all know it.
[7316.82s -> 7330.89s]  Consider remembering. Meet. Fully heal health and cure all status ailments.
[7330.89s -> 7351.62s]  This thing is shaking. Remember. Ooh. Wait, we have lore. I'm gonna read it. Okay.
[7352.50s -> 7357.22s]  The NPC anti-heroes built barbaric pits where they fought one another to the death.
[7357.22s -> 7363.22s]  Their aspiration was to rise above the heroes they'd grown to hate. To strip away the weakness
[7363.22s -> 7368.82s]  which had kept them subservient, and save the world themselves. They called their champions
[7368.82s -> 7375.72s]  potheads due to their distinct armor. The anti-hero Brendan Merkel was the only known NPC to
[7375.72s -> 7381.22s]  single-handedly slay heroes. Unlike the other potheads, he donned the armor of his victims.
[7381.22s -> 7392.15s]  I could still feel my hero's blood congealing in me while Brendan Merkel slipped me on. Jesus.
[7392.89s -> 7401.08s]  Whoa! Whoa! Look, look, look, look, look! Look it! I'm like a person! What? Holy shit! That's a-
[7401.08s -> 7423.32s]  Okay, that was actually a pretty cool reveal. What? He's a real boy! Very cool. All right. Yeah!
[7423.32s -> 7432.38s]  All right, let's go. It's a full set bonus. You actually look normal. That's pretty cool. I'm
[7432.38s -> 7457.91s]  not gonna lie. Take the armor off. Let's find out. Yeah, so if I take a piece off. Ah. Yeah,
[7457.91s -> 7465.27s]  it's all kind of pixely. When you complete it, it turns into like a 3D game. See how these are kind
[7465.27s -> 7475.93s]  of low fidelity? This whole outfit was low fidelity until I completed it. It's a metaphor. Cool.
[7495.18s -> 7504.74s]  I gotta remember so then the world can look like a 3D game. Not gonna lie, that's kind of freaking
[7504.74s -> 7526.12s]  pog. I don't have any heals. Oh, fuck you. I gotta make it count right now. God damn it.
[7526.12s -> 7541.67s]  That's all right. It's all right. Shit. Mind your tongue, one who lacks peanut allergy.
[7550.06s -> 7561.53s]  Why did you say it like that? That's just a weird way to say that. Mind your tongue. All right,
[7561.53s -> 7600.30s]  let's get back over there. That was kind of a long ways away. Don't freak out. I gotta get better at
[7600.30s -> 7607.08s]  that because that this whole class is about parrying and backstabs and crits and I gotta be
[7607.08s -> 7636.97s]  better at that. That's how I'm gonna get any kills at all. Okay, go on, do it. Do it. You're only
[7636.97s -> 7675.24s]  behind here. Got it. You can do well too. It's good to know. Gesture trust. Load and die. Oh,
[7675.24s -> 7709.32s]  all right, something bad down here. Blue jerry wall. Somebody's behind me. Right behind. Just
[7709.32s -> 7738.02s]  use the Zweander. I think that's it. What's going on? Oh, they were all following me from before,
[7738.02s -> 7783.27s]  I guess. Clean. Barnacles. This guy is good. These unstable pixel doors. I wonder what that
[7783.27s -> 7823.99s]  means. Legend of Independence. Ugly thing. What? Who rated that good? Ugly thing. What was that?
[7823.99s -> 7839.51s]  That was very weird. Okay, I'm very far right now. I do not want to die. I'm going to play like a
[7839.51s -> 7883.91s]  coward. I'm written. Betray. Trade? Are these scripted messages? I, no, I don't think so. NPC?
[7895.99s -> 7896.71s]  Is this bait?
[7916.97s -> 7944.15s]  Was that a bad idea? I don't know. I don't know. I've never played this before. Ugly thing. No.
[7946.01s -> 7965.69s]  I'm going to say, um, a bunch of swears. Oh, okay. How about, um, consider, consider, uh,
[7966.57s -> 8013.30s]  consider a concept. Tiny, tiny cardboard box. This is aggro range. Forgotten knight armor.
[8013.30s -> 8037.19s]  This relic's memory has been forgotten. So I can't do anything about that. Maybe some things you
[8037.19s -> 8045.27s]  just can't do. They have no memory. Here's the, all right, I gotta remember this. This is the
[8045.27s -> 8094.60s]  shortcut. That was cute. Making sure. Oh fuck. Okay. Parry, parry, parry, parry, parry. I'm
[8094.60s -> 8153.54s]  going to die in one fucking hit. Jesus. I have a lot of souls. Okay. Oh, nope. What? Oh, it's
[8153.54s -> 8168.58s]  kind of slowed. All right. This looks like progress. Do I want to drop down here though?
[8168.58s -> 8175.75s]  I guess over that way. Whatever. I'm going for it. Have I not been, how did I not get this?
[8175.75s -> 8199.54s]  Caliber of memory. Shit. Flow state entered. I wonder what that means. More damage or something.
[8199.54s -> 8234.38s]  Okay. This guy's wearing pots and pans. I'm dead. God damn it. I got killed by the guy with a
[8234.38s -> 8247.46s]  fucking pot on his head. I was so, all right. That's 6,000 souls. I don't want to lose that.
[8247.46s -> 8265.82s]  Okay. I opened up a new place. There was a new place I opened. I think it's up here. Why was it?
[8265.82s -> 8276.98s]  And then I don't really remember. I'm probably going the long way, but
[8278.26s -> 8320.25s]  it's all right. I did not go in these. Oh, big mistake. Get it. Did I get it? Nope. All right.
[8320.25s -> 8354.94s]  That's better. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All
[8354.94s -> 8368.44s]  right. The door was, I don't remember. Oh, wait. It's this guy. I got to get better at parrying.
[8368.44s -> 8382.28s]  Truly fucking awful at this game. The parrying aspect of it. All right. This is the Smith and
[8382.36s -> 8398.01s]  then it was up and around because I opened the door up here. Right. No, did I? I'm in the right
[8398.01s -> 8439.45s]  vicinity. I know that. We'll get your souls. Yeah. I'm, I'm making my way over there. Okay.
[8439.45s -> 8448.86s]  Almost there. This was a huge backtrack and I'm really not happy about it at all. But I'm
[8448.86s -> 8474.28s]  almost there. There's definitely a door. I could have just gone in, but whatever. All right. Here
[8474.28s -> 8489.22s]  we are. Good, good, good, good, good, good. Let's go. I went in here. I went across and then the
[8489.22s -> 8512.55s]  guy with the pot in his head killed me. Okay. Don't screw this up. Where, where, where was it?
[8512.55s -> 8527.51s]  Shit. I'm confused. No. Was it through here? I'm in the right vicinity. I just don't know
[8527.51s -> 8550.55s]  exactly where I need to go. Was it actually across the bridge? I think this is accurate. Yep. Okay.
[8550.55s -> 8620.60s]  Good. All right. Round two. Let's go. Antihero pothead. This relic is part of a set. Okay. So
[8620.60s -> 8640.89s]  this is part of a set. 7.8, 1.6. Am I fat rolling? Cause it looks kind of funny. Wait a minute.
[8642.04s -> 8665.86s]  Aha. I knew I, wait, that's not even the shovel. Wait, it costs money to do some of these. Do it.
[8665.86s -> 8692.18s]  I mean, I guess it just does scale with dexterity. I'll do it. First damage to evil. Let's try it.
[8692.18s -> 8715.62s]  Uh, 66 or 63. Ooh, that's not good at all. 93 plus 67 versus 60 say this is way worse. I try it.
[8715.62s -> 8728.12s]  It's a really good scaling weapon. Yeah. If I had more decks, maybe it'd be cool, but nope.
[8728.12s -> 8746.86s]  Still cool though. Yeah. Good range. What the fuck is that? Uh, okay.
[8775.16s -> 8783.16s]  You've been left to figure things out for yourself and that's terrible. So let me help.
[8783.80s -> 8790.52s]  Nostal guy was a gauntlet where heroes, I want to R one so bad for a bit, unfortunately,
[8790.52s -> 8796.76s]  and then sacrifice themselves back to the world's heart so that new stories could begin.
[8797.40s -> 8805.72s]  These new stories were inspired by what came before. They built on the beauty of the past,
[8805.72s -> 8811.80s]  but heroes quit letting go. They grew obsessed with maintaining their dominance,
[8811.80s -> 8819.00s]  live in their own legacies. And without new inspiration, Nostal Gaia is being forgotten.
[8819.00s -> 8825.16s]  Anywho, if selfish heroes won't give themselves back willingly, a real hero will have to make
[8825.16s -> 8841.24s]  them let go. Then Nostal Gaia's heart will open again. The first great one chokes Nostal Gaia from
[8841.24s -> 8877.06s]  the depths. Oh, no, he likes it. The first great one chokes Nostal. All you gotta do is kill it.
[8877.14s -> 8884.62s]  I can't believe that must have been really hard. Oh, it hurts. Oh, yeah, it hurts. Oh,
[8884.62s -> 8904.34s]  fuck you. Oh my God. All right, I'm leaving. I can take it. I can take it.
[8906.84s -> 8912.62s]  I'm going to leave now. I'm going to leave now. The lanky bundle wobbled and climbed,
[8912.62s -> 8925.96s]  ever eager to reach some height unsuited to it. I thought I could kill it. Gold shortage,
[8925.96s -> 8946.57s]  hunters wanted. OK, I got a lot of stuff. Wait, I can bring that back to that guy. Oh, it's
[8946.57s -> 8970.01s]  happiness. I can't. OK, this is important. What do I level up here? Decks, probably right.
[8970.01s -> 8975.02s]  Oh, new luck ability. Decks and luck. And there's an anvil.
[9004.58s -> 9008.10s]  The sake of you and yours. But some materials were used for meaningful things,
[9008.10s -> 9012.90s]  like improving our hero's arms. Took pride in our work back then.
[9014.50s -> 9020.90s]  No sign of a master smith. Well, I have some crude skills. I'll aid you. Best I can, hero.
[9021.94s -> 9031.13s]  OK, hone weapons. Uh, sliver of tradition. Oh, shit, I have to actually think about this.
[9031.93s -> 9045.10s]  It's probably this one, right? I feel like it's that one. The voice acting is legit good.
[9045.10s -> 9056.33s]  It is. What about infuse? So I can infuse the this with the legend of independence,
[9057.22s -> 9075.05s]  independent edge of entropy 214. That's better. But I'm going to go for this. I feel like this
[9075.05s -> 9085.88s]  thing's pretty good. It makes it pure with no scaling. Um, this is just way better. So I'm
[9085.88s -> 9089.16s]  going to stick with this. I mean, this is the other one that probably is pretty good, but
[9089.72s -> 9104.07s]  I'm going to go with this. OK, I need three of those to get it higher. Do the halberd too.
[9104.07s -> 9107.58s]  Eventually, this might be really good with the scaling. I'm going to hold on for now.
[9108.22s -> 9113.24s]  If you find another anvil, especially with a master smith, remember to summon me there, too.
[9113.80s -> 9135.43s]  OK. Uh, yeah. All right. 15 decks, I think is good. I'll stop there. We'll get vitality
[9135.43s -> 9148.20s]  stamina to 15 and then luck to 25. Go do the shackle quest. All right. Can I teleport tether
[9148.20s -> 9164.50s]  warp? I mean, this is going to bring me. I definitely want to keep it here. All right.
[9164.50s -> 9169.14s]  Time for me to work backwards. Good luck, because I don't have I don't remember anything that just
[9169.14s -> 9186.97s]  happened. I remember going this way. I know I don't. All right. I'm going to go check out
[9186.97s -> 9196.54s]  that NPC. What is it? Can I open that? OK, this is locked. It's like glitched out. Yeah, I remember
[9196.54s -> 9216.55s]  this. Oh, I can take it. Oh, yeah. OK. Uh, drop down. All right. Where was that guy over there?
[9228.30s -> 9254.95s]  That's doing 533 damage. OK, we got to go across. I don't know. Is it going to kill me? All right.
[9254.95s -> 9268.90s]  Where this guy's right here somewhere, right? All right. Are you ready? I don't know if I want
[9268.90s -> 9302.50s]  this person to hang out with me. OK. My hero. Get like traps in here or something. I'm going
[9302.50s -> 9315.86s]  to get killed or something. Welcome to my shop. It's a shopkeeper. I have long longed for you,
[9315.86s -> 9325.86s]  my radiance. We all did once. I wish you could experience the parades and feasts we held in your
[9325.86s -> 9333.70s]  honor. Banner maidens and clamoring children all thronging the streets to glimpse our salvation,
[9333.70s -> 9341.22s]  our markets overflowing with the bounty each hero's deeds had brought us. That was enough,
[9341.22s -> 9348.02s]  but we have forgotten. I must never read them myself in your presence, my everything.
[9348.02s -> 9356.18s]  For should the great forgetting take me, I could not bear that these pixels I was should turn
[9356.18s -> 9373.48s]  ravenous upon you. Oh, what is this shit? You could be a caster. That's right. That's cool.
[9373.48s -> 9388.50s]  Should I buy any? Vibrating sword. This thing's kind of cool looking. Deck scaling. Noble E.
[9388.50s -> 9408.57s]  Pien. Is this a spell? No, this is no, it is a spell. I kind of want this. Not that expensive
[9408.57s -> 9421.75s]  either. Hold on. I'm gonna get it. Wilk, I would make you such but never must I make such an ease
[9421.75s -> 9433.94s]  of it. Therefore, tis for memory for meaning. Okay, I want it. Let me have it. Oh, one of these
[9433.94s -> 9444.25s]  too. Torch. I get that. Maybe I should get the torch. This thing's ready to get. Oh, this it's
[9444.25s -> 9476.71s]  in here. Thousand. All right, hold on. Let's go for it. Remember, thousand. Crit damage up in offhand.
[9476.71s -> 9513.37s]  Wait, by how much? Do welding. I'll rock this for a little while. The rest of this stuff I'll have
[9513.37s -> 9518.42s]  to come back for. I don't really know what it's I know what this is for. But maybe I should get the
[9518.42s -> 9523.11s]  torch. I'm probably going to be pissed if I don't buy this. You know, in an hour, I'm going to be
[9523.11s -> 9541.45s]  like I was right there. I had an opportunity and I didn't do it. Is this thing vibrate? Okay, that
[9541.45s -> 9547.24s]  was cool. It was worth coming back here for. I could upgrade this too. All right, I'm going to
[9547.24s -> 9566.60s]  upgrade this. Hold on. I feel like I could just die and just wake up at that bonfire. Let me test
[9566.60s -> 9577.38s]  it out. All right, I actually like it. This is way, way cooler than what I was doing before.
[9577.38s -> 9590.79s]  All right. What's the fat? The fastest way is probably just to go backwards,
[9594.12s -> 9619.06s]  right? And just teleport to the bonfire. It's like right here. It's like over here, right? I don't
[9619.06s -> 9634.90s]  remember. No, it's not. It's back. Um, just kill me. Just kill me. Just kill me. If there's more
[9634.90s -> 9649.51s]  than two layers to a level, I will forget where I am every time. If your game has three layers,
[9649.51s -> 9653.99s]  one of them is always not in is always gone. It could be the middle layer. It could be the top
[9653.99s -> 9659.59s]  layer. It could be the bottom layer. One of them is gone. No matter what, it always happens to me.
[9659.59s -> 9665.45s]  All right, let me upgrade this. If the Smith's hammer choosing me,
[9665.45s -> 9678.47s]  ain't assigned them. Ooh, yeah. Hopefully this wasn't a bad decision, especially with the master
[9678.47s -> 9703.72s]  Smith. All right, let's go check over here. Now, is there a jump? Uh, but hold on. Is that bad?
[9703.72s -> 9746.42s]  Yeah, it's bad. Why are you using rivers of blood? Because it's good. How come you don't do the
[9746.50s -> 9760.31s]  ooh, ooh anymore? Because I, we might have to have another kill the meme stream. I'm telling you.
[9762.62s -> 9768.28s]  Do you remember that? I keep seeing a lot of similar memes show up and you know,
[9768.28s -> 9780.10s]  it's time to kill the fucking meme. I think we've got to do another one.
[9780.10s -> 9787.05s]  80% of everybody here does not remember that. Yeah, I mean, I'm starting to see some of the same
[9787.13s -> 9804.84s]  jokes, right? It might be time. It might be time. And I, I'm at fault of this too.
[9804.84s -> 9813.11s]  What about scorn? You can't kill scorn. Oh, no, I don't think, I don't think scorn is part of this.
[9813.11s -> 9842.63s]  Where do I go? Ooh, is this where we going? Memes have an expiration date. It'll happen naturally.
[9844.41s -> 9857.59s]  It depends on what it is. All right. So this is all right. Where am I now?
[9858.62s -> 9861.82s]  This is back in the beginning. This is that like undead at Berg area.
[9862.46s -> 9876.68s]  So I don't really want to be, no, I don't want to be here. They get unfunny,
[9876.68s -> 9882.42s]  then become legacy memes and then are funny again. I think after the kill the meme stream,
[9882.42s -> 9886.82s]  I, I think there was a lot of people that really came up with a lot of new stuff
[9887.46s -> 9897.83s]  because of that shit. I mean, I guess I'm going over there.
[9897.83s -> 9931.08s]  I just got magnetized to the ground. Whoa. Lacking any depth of its own,
[9931.08s -> 9946.58s]  the sticks began poking into the depths of our world. Rude. Is this like bad what I'm doing?
[9947.30s -> 9984.07s]  Why do they have that over their heads? Oh, they're cobalt. I get it. Okay. Friend curiosity.
[9984.07s -> 10016.34s]  Memory of an inanimate object. Try patience. People, people saying, stop, stop, stop.
[10016.34s -> 10033.10s]  This is 200 experience every time. Hold on. Wait, remembrance. What does that mean? Wait,
[10033.10s -> 10049.26s]  now they're in a different mode. This offhanded weapon is, is I'm never going to take this off.
[10049.26s -> 10065.29s]  This thing is so good. Extra crit too. Oh, you have a lot of health.
[10083.32s -> 10118.17s]  What is that? Strength. Heavy prying tool. Strength weapon. It's the half life crowbar.
[10118.17s -> 10135.88s]  What does this one say? It's probably really funny. Actually kind of funny.
[10135.88s -> 10152.98s]  One hit. Try rushing. All right. Actually be careful. I'll have a try rushing and then try
[10152.98s -> 10172.12s]  patience. What was that? Okay. It's fine. What did you hit me with? Oh, I'm out of stamina.
[10172.12s -> 10190.55s]  Don't do it. Okay. I need, where is it? I know I have like two of them, right?
[10190.55s -> 10195.61s]  Shit. I thought I got it off. I thought I killed them. Damn it.
[10201.75s -> 10212.46s]  It yelled like I do when I have a bug on me. Gold coins. Oh, just like a marker,
[10212.46s -> 10249.82s]  which should censor the censor the word poop. What? It's not stable. I can't open it. This is
[10249.82s -> 10272.41s]  locked. Oh, that's creepy. Was there another way to go? Is that it? Oh, suddenly a fire erupted
[10272.41s -> 10312.65s]  to burn the kindling down. This is going to be a hard poll. So you're not, everybody's running.
[10312.65s -> 10342.38s]  Okay. I don't have any more heels either. This is going to be pain in the ass. Thank God. I think
[10342.38s -> 10364.84s]  he would like a hundred gecks. Um, we've listened to that on stream before coins. I didn't think
[10364.84s -> 10385.62s]  he was going to turn around that quick. I thought he was busy mining chain mail. What is this damage
[10385.62s -> 10397.72s]  that bounces between enemies send out some loaded correspondence that damages one enemy and then get
[10397.72s -> 10420.97s]  sent to additional enemies. That's funny. I really don't want to blow this and I'm probably going to
[10421.70s -> 10456.63s]  whatever falling. Um, our one, please don't, I don't want to do this again. Just turn around and
[10456.63s -> 10468.23s]  run. Oh my God. This is a wall. Uh, do I have any heels? Ah, I just probably woke somebody up. I'm
[10468.23s -> 10499.56s]  sorry. Jesus. Thank God. I don't have any heels. Remember my newborn is crying. Well, go, go take
[10499.56s -> 10511.64s]  care of your baby. Why are you, why are you writing that here? Hey, he's going to let you know my
[10511.64s -> 10533.85s]  newborn's crying. Uh, chat. What should I do? I don't know. Is the baby hungry? Is the baby tired?
[10533.85s -> 10539.75s]  I don't know anything about you or your life. I have no idea who you even are. I don't have any
[10539.75s -> 10556.94s]  advice for your baby. Oh, you've got a magical enchanted to pickaxe. This is some Minecraft
[10556.94s -> 10565.99s]  shit right here and he's going to kill me in one hit swing, swing it, swing it, please.
[10565.99s -> 10573.67s]  Fuck you. Oh my God. Oh no, that was a weird animation. I don't know where this is.
[10574.47s -> 10589.08s]  Shit. No, no, no, no. I do. I do. I know what this is. I know what this is. I know what that is.
[10599.83s -> 10609.10s]  Be remembered ahead. All right, we got to go all the freaking way. Where was it? This way or that
[10609.10s -> 10630.07s]  way? God, all the freaking way. Where was it? This is the wrong way. Isn't it? This is the wrong way.
[10630.07s -> 10670.86s]  Isn't it? All right, come on. Do you have any tips? I just started the game. Um, it's pretty fun.
[10670.86s -> 10696.06s]  It's, it's, I would hold on. Okay. It's yes. Do you have any tips? It's fun. That was, yeah,
[10696.06s -> 10705.37s]  that was not a good tip. I apologize for that bad tip. I'll give you a real tip though.
[10705.37s -> 10748.22s]  So dodge rolling is your friend. Hey, dodge rolling is your friend stuck. That's the wrong
[10748.22s -> 10766.78s]  fucking way. This is the wrong way. Well, I have to kill everything now for the wrong way. It's,
[10766.78s -> 10782.87s]  it's left instead of right. Go up that. I'm just going to say stupid, but you go up there and just
[10782.87s -> 10803.37s]  go left straight. Do not go right, right. Lazy to the bottom of that thing. Okay. Move. That was
[10803.45s -> 10850.95s]  absolute bullshit. This way. All right. Then we go, um, here. All right. This is new shit swing.
[10850.95s -> 10889.22s]  What the hell was that? Okay. I got to pull you over here. Oh, God damn it. Sorry. One little
[10889.22s -> 10930.14s]  piece of shit of life. Don't kill me. Chill, man. It's stressful. I, what do you mean? Chill. Okay.
[10930.14s -> 10948.62s]  Um, so I was down there. You're going to cast that bullshit. Everyone's going to run down this
[10948.62s -> 10992.02s]  hall. I don't want to fight in the water either. Rooting voice potion. Oh, nice. A green herb.
[10992.02s -> 10999.61s]  I have never seen a squirrel in real life. You haven't? I mean, that's not that weird.
[10999.61s -> 11004.15s]  Where would, I don't know what part of the world you're from. Where in the world are there no
[11004.15s -> 11041.78s]  squirrels? Okay. This is a conversation that I need to not pay attention to. Yeah. Squirrels are
[11041.78s -> 11058.31s]  kind of interesting, I guess. Are there any squirrels in Vegas? I think so. I don't know.
[11062.33s -> 11080.66s]  I think so. Although I can't tell you I've really, I haven't really seen any squirrels. Squirrels.
[11080.66s -> 11090.06s]  Maybe. It's something I didn't put into my memory bank. This is a dangerous room. I don't know.
[11090.06s -> 11099.34s]  There are two NPCs. Your lack of caution is what I fear. I would never fear that. Shh. Someone's
[11099.34s -> 11123.00s]  coming. I might have to fight these people. Hello. You don't look like the forgotten we've been
[11123.00s -> 11128.52s]  slaughtering. Don't look like much of anything. Like we should criticize?
[11129.88s -> 11137.24s]  True, true. What a ridiculously rendered three are we. Take our company, friend. I call myself
[11137.96s -> 11145.24s]  nameless Nero. My companion is the lady Sco Peacutt. Just Sco, please. Nero's titles
[11145.96s -> 11152.92s]  don't fit. We are pondering a most dubious task. A quest, I like to think. We don't have to be
[11152.92s -> 11161.00s]  reckless to prove our worth. Ah, but we must when the world is filled. Assassin's Creed unity,
[11161.00s -> 11168.95s]  girl. That's funny. I can see the latent heroism in their stature. Not unlike my own. Would you
[11168.95s -> 11176.71s]  help us, stranger? This quest might give my friend the value he needs. Shh. Really, you're bravery,
[11176.71s -> 11185.43s]  Sco. I do not need aid, but I welcome a compatriot always. I'll do it. There is a creature down this
[11185.43s -> 11193.35s]  corridor that seems not of this story. The lady is fascinated. While I seek cause to vanquish without
[11193.35s -> 11201.35s]  question, that is evil as a thing we agree upon wholeheartedly. So I give you this quest. Well,
[11201.43s -> 11208.47s]  actually, I share it. I, uh, gave it to myself first. Are you ready to face the unknown at our
[11208.47s -> 11217.83s]  side? What about I don't have any heels. I knew it. Come my allies for today. We prove our worth.
[11217.83s -> 11232.28s]  Let's go. You can do it. Suddenly victory. Holy shit. We have, what is this? All right. You guys
[11232.28s -> 11258.46s]  fight it. That hurt a lot. Help them. I'm using these spells. I'm casting. We did it.
[11258.46s -> 11276.44s]  Arachnid stinger. We did it. We're incredible. In nameless Nero, you have made an ally. Henceforth,
[11276.44s -> 11288.66s]  our paths towards heroism are entwined. It's going to make me laugh every time. Oh, it was a quest,
[11288.66s -> 11297.72s]  but I didn't really plan a reward. Ah, it's not much. That sucks. It is a token of my esteem.
[11298.44s -> 11308.46s]  We shall be the forms the future follows. That sucked. I feel bigger. May we meet again,
[11308.46s -> 11316.30s]  my friend. We would have failed without you friend. Nero means well with his quests and his titles.
[11316.30s -> 11322.94s]  I suppose we each have to make meaning of this world or impose meaning upon it. Nero is certain
[11322.94s -> 11331.30s]  of his path, or at least he's certain he has one for myself. I do wonder. Take this,
[11332.18s -> 11338.18s]  a small token of my gratitude. That's a way better reward than yours. What was that creature? The
[11338.18s -> 11346.22s]  pieces do not fit. What was that? I feel me. All right. What else? Anything that's down here?
[11347.02s -> 11368.68s]  Wait. Important, right? Hold on. Torch. Maybe. Maybe. No. Maybe. I did get some new weapon,
[11368.68s -> 11392.02s]  though. What was that? Strength. Always check. Anything is vibrating down here. No. That's
[11392.02s -> 11402.17s]  pretty cool. All right. Goodbye. I thought this game was going to be a 45 minute joke game,
[11402.17s -> 11410.10s]  but this is actually cool as hell. I would very much agree with you. This has just been sitting
[11410.10s -> 11418.73s]  in my Steam. I've just been waiting to play it. Just like, oh yeah. Okay. So I mentioned this
[11418.73s -> 11427.42s]  months and months ago. I just had it in my Steam library. And I told you guys before,
[11429.98s -> 11434.62s]  there's not going to be like, oh, should I play that today? Am I going to play that tonight?
[11435.26s -> 11441.67s]  Maybe another night. I don't know. Might not be any good. No, we're in a new era. A new era of
[11441.67s -> 11457.94s]  just play anything. And who cares? Wow. Double swing? Really? Why am I not swinging with this
[11457.94s -> 11474.97s]  other weapon? Shit. All right. That looks pretty cool. Shaking. Wait, what kind of gear is this?
[11475.61s -> 11501.83s]  This is way too heavy. Is it too heavy? I mean in fat rolling. Might as well just do it. Why not?
[11501.83s -> 11536.15s]  Pretty cool. Ancient alloy. 2000. Fine. Oh, look it. It looks cool now. I still haven't unlocked
[11536.15s -> 11549.78s]  this one yet either. That's pretty cool. But I got to keep this on. I guess I keep the pants on,
[11549.78s -> 11563.74s]  right? Yeah. I like that look. All right. I don't want to blow this. I very much could.
[11563.74s -> 11578.14s]  I need to go game progress route. I don't know where that is. Kind of turned around here. This
[11578.14s -> 11614.22s]  looks accurate. I guess that's what the gold coins are for. Oh my God. I just swing already. You're
[11614.22s -> 11648.68s]  driving me crazy. Swing already. You're driving me crazy. I'm not fucking around. Sorry. Not
[11648.68s -> 11655.14s]  messing around. I have no health. You think I'm going to find my way back to this place? You're
[11655.14s -> 11689.74s]  dreaming. Exploding. Whatever that is. Now he's being serious. Yeah. Because do you see how far
[11689.74s -> 11700.97s]  down I am? I don't remember how I got here. You killed me through the door. I'm going to be
[11700.97s -> 11746.50s]  very upset about it. Shit. Can I close the door? I'm dead. I am dead here. No. He turned around so
[11746.50s -> 11781.67s]  quickly. I thought I had like another half second. The shrine was right there. All right. Dude,
[11781.67s -> 11804.90s]  that's mad embarrassing. It is embarrassing. Okay. Then it was over here and then over here
[11807.37s -> 11832.49s]  and then over here and then this way and then through here and then down here and then this way
[11832.49s -> 11861.67s]  and this way and then down. Wait, there's this weird person down here. I forgot. Oh God. I'm down
[11861.67s -> 11876.22s]  here with the fucking Minecraft guy. 5,000 souls about to be deleted. Wait, I can cheese the hell
[11876.22s -> 11884.71s]  out of this. Where are my weapons? Where am I? What's going on with my weapons? They're all
[11884.71s -> 11895.80s]  getting I was hoping just for a crit and just killed like three or four of them in a row.
[11895.80s -> 11913.75s]  Fuck. Whatever. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Don't worry. Shit. Shit. Minus 5k. It's all right.
[11913.75s -> 11949.56s]  We'll get him back. Bullshit. All right. Same deal. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. This time it's
[11949.56s -> 11979.83s]  is it this way instead? I think it's wait. I don't know. I went the same way. All right. I
[11979.83s -> 11994.41s]  killed the Minecraft character. Does that do anything? Nothing in the water or anything?
[11994.41s -> 12028.66s]  Oh shit. Uh, this is a shortcut. Yeah. Right. I'm not going to remember what this is. I mean,
[12028.66s -> 12068.47s]  I know it exists though. I'm going to aggro that thing behind me accidentally. Aren't I friend?
[12068.47s -> 12110.15s]  Foe? Oh geez. Okay. Green herb. Do you have a shirt on? I'm not going to confirm or deny if I
[12110.15s -> 12139.38s]  have any clothing on. Well, I have that do, but not consider. Wow. Interesting. Minus two. Really?
[12139.38s -> 12155.40s]  I am so far gone at this point. Yes. I'm going to go over there. Padlock. Oh, there it is. Oh,
[12155.40s -> 12188.74s]  this is it. I made it. I made it. I actually made it. Okay. Cool. Oh, I have no stamina.
[12188.74s -> 12205.35s]  No, please. Please. Please. No, please. Uh, um, this way. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Touch
[12205.35s -> 12210.95s]  it. Touch it. Touch it. Touch it. Touch it. Touch it. Quick. Sit at it. Quick. Sit down. Sit down.
[12210.95s -> 12233.82s]  Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit. I can't attack them. I don't have
[12233.82s -> 12278.28s]  a good opportunity. Oh God. All right. Thank goodness. I definitely want more stamina. I can
[12278.28s -> 12287.74s]  feel it. Uh, tether it here. Now I have a lot of crunchies. I think I'm going to use most of them.
[12287.74s -> 12312.14s]  Yeah. Let's use them all. 500. That's it. That's nothing. That was a weird hiccup weapon upgrade.
[12312.14s -> 12333.70s]  I don't see anything vibrating. Dexterity. Marking yourself with this willing. Wait,
[12333.70s -> 12350.17s]  what does this mean? I did this. I wonder if these are permanent or is it just for a short
[12350.17s -> 12407.59s]  duration? Okay. Kill on site. So where is the right way up? Up and around you. Ooh, item.
[12407.59s -> 12444.54s]  Leonard's lounge shorts. There's a pair of boxers. I mean, that's a comedy. There's a comedy item.
[12444.54s -> 12478.55s]  Comedy items are fine. I'm going to go across. Can I even go across? Maybe I could fall the bird
[12478.55s -> 12495.86s]  armor on with the boxers. It's fat rolling still. Where's my weight? There it is. Load 87%. I wonder
[12495.86s -> 12518.65s]  how much you need to have not fat roll 76. That's still fat rolling 37%. I think that's mid.
[12518.65s -> 12527.48s]  Don't think much is this way. 31. That's actually really heavy. 61. All right. 60%. I think it's
[12527.48s -> 12549.72s]  75%. We rate this out of 10. I think it's a little early to say that. Ooh, is something else down
[12549.72s -> 12569.11s]  there? Weird. Um, I definitely can't drop the best way to go. I don't know. Is there like a
[12569.11s -> 12607.74s]  better way to go? You should be fine if you jump. I was down here. Patience. No, there's no way.
[12607.74s -> 12616.31s]  I am absolutely dead. I'm dead. So might as well just laugh. And that was kind of funny.
[12616.31s -> 12653.98s]  I can't do it. Oh, you actually can't do it. Why did I even come over here? Well, you actually
[12653.98s -> 12674.98s]  can't do it. That person was right. Okay. So where is the right way to go down and around?
[12674.98s -> 12715.40s]  I don't know. Is there another? I can go in here. I think it's in here. No. All right. Deeper into
[12715.40s -> 12728.49s]  the mine. Just just swing with the offhand. Honestly, the offhand just does way more damage
[12728.49s -> 12740.01s]  in the combo. Can you tell me the germa meal? I want McDonald's. Um, grab yourself a McChicken.
[12740.01s -> 12745.61s]  Look capable of besting the victims of Nostalgia's decay. The stick figure had
[12745.61s -> 12754.33s]  not yet faced a healer. A great one. Such would reveal the futility of everything an old man
[12755.05s -> 12777.05s]  and some sticks sought to prove. Oh, it's that guy again. Enemies ahead. All right. I'm not reading
[12777.05s -> 12805.24s]  them anymore. Oh, you're going to come help me fight. We help. They like this consequences
[12805.24s -> 12821.64s]  for each one of these tether. I can tether him. I don't know what that means. Sure. Why not?
[12828.87s -> 12846.78s]  You coming? Oh, that's a lot of people. Are you coming or what? Grindr? What is it?
[12846.86s -> 12850.30s]  What are these people supposed to be? That's a guy naked.
[12852.86s -> 12909.02s]  All right. Don't die. Don't die. It's music. We do it. Uh, what on earth is that?
[12915.13s -> 12922.66s]  Let's go. Holy shit. That was so much easier than I thought it was going to be.
[12923.30s -> 12942.95s]  That was so simple. Oh no, it's, it's a joke. It's a joke. What? All right. What do we do? Jesus.
[12943.83s -> 12997.26s]  What if my friend dies? No, he's going to die. Oh, one hit, one hit, one hit, one hit, one hit.
[12998.14s -> 13021.82s]  Got it. And he stayed alive. The legendary. Thanks for the help. Actually, really thanks
[13021.82s -> 13044.70s]  for the help because that probably would have been really hard. Why? Why would you even help?
[13049.62s -> 13059.43s]  The Grindr's withered icon. Oh, that was supposed to be World of Warcraft players.
[13059.43s -> 13066.49s]  That explains the naked guy, right? What is it? Increases heroic icon uses?
[13067.13s -> 13076.52s]  The withered heroic icon of an obsessed hero, Amalgam. There was once something meaningful
[13076.52s -> 13084.76s]  about this item. A legacy that can live on in you. Returning this to Astelgaia through her beacons
[13084.76s -> 13099.59s]  will increase the uses of your own heroic icon. Interesting. What was the weapon? The Lair
[13099.59s -> 13123.10s]  Generic. We were once distinct weapons. Our heroes grouping up beside the tavern's hearth strength.
[13123.10s -> 13132.02s]  Very interesting. Um, well, that was cool. I'm going to go. Thanks for the help. These are
[13132.02s -> 13136.02s]  probably a bunch of weird messages. Let's find out what this one says. I did it and I can't believe
[13136.02s -> 13152.58s]  it. Yes, let's go. Your McDonald's order. Oh, um, McChicken and a large fry.
[13160.10s -> 13169.11s]  Uh, maybe a McDouble. I've since tamed my, uh, my McDonald's order.
[13175.34s -> 13215.82s]  That helps. Remember a head, but consider pixels. Um, what? A head? I mean, I think I'm just dead
[13215.82s -> 13238.04s]  if I walk here. What the fuck? Oh, okay. What is with that aim? That just was targeting me.
[13238.04s -> 13310.79s]  I'm trying to survive here. Unburdened. Ooh, unburdened. Oh, it's a quality weapon. Dex and
[13310.79s -> 13379.00s]  strength. Does he even know he's streaming? What? What happened? I'm fucking live. I like the sound
[13379.00s -> 13394.84s]  effects you make when you run. My crafter. When she discarded all the implements of tradition,
[13394.84s -> 13401.26s]  all the tools of craftsmanship that had defined progress here before, I was among the refuse.
[13401.26s -> 13431.05s]  Minecraft pickaxe or the bonfire. I'm all right for now. I'm all right. I'm doing good. You are
[13431.05s -> 13457.82s]  literally shaking. Uh, watch out for left. Hey, look at that cheating. Like what happened? Why did
[13457.82s -> 13485.40s]  my game fucking froze? Oh, my game froze. Um, where do I go from here? I straight up don't know
[13485.40s -> 13518.22s]  where I am. Oh, I know where I am. Bridges down that way. Yeah. Okay. Actually I'm going to play
[13518.22s -> 13532.63s]  here because I don't want to lose. I'm not, I'm not going to pull the whole room. That'd be so awful.
[13532.63s -> 13596.30s]  Okay. Let's do it again. I don't even need to look. Lucky flow state. Oh, shut up. There's no way.
[13596.30s -> 13626.66s]  Whatever. You should do an oil tier list. Uh, olive oil S. Um, peanut oil probably high A or low S.
[13626.66s -> 13641.53s]  Crude oil. Uh, no, crude oil is probably like, I would say like probably a D. You know what I mean?
[13641.53s -> 13688.04s]  That's like a D. Come on, let's go. I got 13,000 right now. There's got to be another bonfire
[13688.04s -> 13741.86s]  coming up. I bet. Sunflower oil, seed oils. What about mineral oil? Eh, maybe a C. Don't, don't,
[13741.86s -> 13756.71s]  don't, don't, don't. I almost died. All that to get all the way over here and pick this up. But
[13756.71s -> 13776.33s]  what about that? The door. Um, what's the right way to go? What about lavender oil? That's not bad.
[13776.33s -> 13799.45s]  Are they going to run all the way around? Actually this is incredible for me. This is the best thing
[13799.45s -> 13826.54s]  that could have happened. They're all just going to leave. They're going the long way. They're all
[13826.54s -> 13829.90s]  coming back. They're all coming back. They're all coming back. They're all coming back. They're all
[13829.90s -> 13876.07s]  coming back. Is this a dead end? No. Um, no, I go up. This is so stupid. Okay, let's go. Oh, not you
[13876.07s -> 13883.82s]  again. Um, they're all going to make it up here eventually. I got to kill them one by one. What
[13883.82s -> 13898.31s]  the fuck was that? I don't know what I just opened, but, um, I couldn't dodge. I just pressed it. I
[13898.31s -> 13916.86s]  swear to God. I did just open something. What did I just open something? Anybody know where that is?
[13916.86s -> 13929.85s]  That's a shortcut, but who knows where the hell that is. It's a door. It's some kind of door.
[13929.85s -> 13938.87s]  Somebody said, dude, did you even try? I like that comment. Dude, did you eat? Nah, I was,
[13938.87s -> 13966.79s]  I just like felt like just dying there. Is this this door which leads? No. All right, slow down.
[13966.79s -> 14003.50s]  Anybody know anybody know where to go from here to get there? Oh my goodness behind you. So like
[14003.50s -> 14030.97s]  through here and then there's another door somewhere. I don't think this is right down there. I don't
[14030.97s -> 14039.58s]  remember. I could go across and then to the right, but is that where the door is? This is the way
[14039.58s -> 14060.89s]  that I was straight through here, but where's the door? You know, Hey, do you know down there
[14060.89s -> 14094.78s]  over there? Um, I think I'll be all right. I'm going to have like 20,000 souls. That shit took
[14094.78s -> 14117.98s]  so long. You did this to yourself? Um, I got two heels. I'm fine getting there. Slow as shit right
[14117.98s -> 14139.42s]  now. I'm so slow. I'm so slow in the fucking, in whatever the poisons swamp. Okay, we're good.
[14139.42s -> 14161.50s]  This is where I left off was down here. I remember this. I don't even give him a chance. Stop being
[14161.50s -> 14176.30s]  so cocky. I just killed this guy right here. Don't let him cast that thing and I should be fine.
[14176.30s -> 14239.90s]  Okay. Nevermind. Oh, oh, oh, I got disappeared. That was really weird. All right. I'm so close.
[14239.90s -> 14277.74s]  I can feel it. I think shaken. I'm going to be a level up like five times this bullshit. I remember
[14277.74s -> 14309.45s]  this room. Uh, don't let him do it. Did you do it? He did it. I got full health though. Just don't
[14309.45s -> 14344.15s]  be stupid. It's very simple. They have one attack pattern. Just wait. Everything's good. Who are
[14344.15s -> 14373.34s]  you talking to? You. I'm talking to you directly. I'm talking to you right now. I'm speaking to you.
[14373.34s -> 14380.31s]  All right. I'm almost there. I want to kill everything in this room because you know that
[14380.31s -> 14393.05s]  I'm going to aggro it somehow. Some ways stupidly. All right. Made it. Now. Where is it from here?
[14393.05s -> 14397.91s]  I remember going in there and freaking out. You got to run all the way up. They throw the bombs.
[14397.91s -> 14431.90s]  Yeah. Everything's fine. Everything's shut up. Do not kill me. They're right here. Where are my
[14431.90s -> 14454.47s]  souls? Thank you. Okay. Don't die. This person's freaking me out. Oh no. Um, okay. Where is there
[14454.47s -> 14492.63s]  a lever to pull? You did it is kill. The hostile guy has been suffering because no one was removing
[14492.63s -> 14502.49s]  her pain except me. I try to lift some of the burden from those who carry to gosh darn much,
[14502.57s -> 14509.77s]  but actions speak louder than words. Now you're a hero. You, you get that. I have a gift for you.
[14510.73s -> 14517.40s]  Relic from a friend I once helped. I have two of these. If you can use it to make
[14517.40s -> 14523.48s]  hostile guy a super duper again, then I'm happy to part with it. Don't prick yourself.
[14523.48s -> 14535.72s]  Oh, it hurts. Oh yeah. Oh, I can take it. All right. No more of that. No more of that.
[14535.72s -> 14555.67s]  I just didn't, didn't know. All right. What about here? So I just said, what a freak.
[14560.50s -> 14584.79s]  What you talking about me? 21,000. Let's go. I can level up five times. 25 luck, 15 stamina.
[14586.89s -> 14603.67s]  What a mad man. What a bad man. Enemies dropped two times memory. That's going to be amazing.
[14603.67s -> 14642.97s]  Look at this thing. Unburdened, unburdened. What's that mean? I know a few things. What do
[14642.97s -> 14647.37s]  you think? Should I pivot to something else or this is kind of this thing. And on the offhand is
[14648.23s -> 14670.52s]  amazing. I definitely want to keep this in my offhand 110, 109, 500. I don't know. Keep this,
[14670.52s -> 14677.77s]  but replace the other thing. What do I really think? This is probably the best thing I have.
[14683.05s -> 14706.07s]  One seven. That's a lot of damage though. 176. This is, has an upgrade. 184, 193. Yeah. This
[14706.07s -> 14715.94s]  thing is amazing. I think I'm just going to upgrade this. Yeah. It's definitely this.
[14731.42s -> 14739.99s]  Okay. Now, um, anything else? What is this thing versus heroic icon uses?
[14739.99s -> 14750.42s]  Heroic icon is this thing that I, all right. So how do I use it? Is it the bonfire return icon
[14750.42s -> 14759.11s]  release of withered heroic icon back into the world. Wait, what does that mean?
[14759.11s -> 14771.86s]  Are we speaking Spanish right now? Hey, when are you going to come to Maryland for some crabs?
[14771.86s -> 14779.64s]  I hope this is not going to mess something up. Your own heroic icon becomes stronger,
[14779.64s -> 14795.30s]  increasing its uses. Oh yeah. Okay. Cool. Let's do it. Or very nice. I don't think I have any more.
[14795.30s -> 14811.24s]  All right. I am ready. I got a new weapon upgrade. I go in here, then we go
[14814.12s -> 14827.19s]  up and we go out and then we don't attack this. Let me go up and we continue. I'm really enjoying
[14827.19s -> 14838.10s]  this. I think this game is actually really fun. I'm very much enjoying this video game experience.
[14838.10s -> 14879.96s]  One more interface. Suddenly. Do I know that? Okay. New area. Maryland crabs are fantastic.
[14882.10s -> 14890.28s]  I bet you they are. I can't say I've ever had a crab from Maryland. New England had a lot of
[14890.28s -> 14897.10s]  great seafood though. Northeast had plenty of that though. So I mean, I kind of already got
[14897.10s -> 14916.17s]  that experience. This looks bad. Carriage door. You guys are strong as fuck. Oh my God. And I
[14916.17s -> 14922.31s]  know I said that I'm like 37. You know what I mean? But whatever. I gotta, I gotta use some
[14922.31s -> 14943.66s]  of the lingo that you guys use, but did you have them with an old lady? Does that make it better?
[14943.66s -> 14958.44s]  No, I have, I did not eat any crabs with any old ladies. Now is this old lady, uh, pressuring me to
[14958.44s -> 14963.80s]  use a certain sauce that I don't want to use? No, no, no. You've put, put some of that, put,
[14963.80s -> 14968.87s]  put that on there. Put it, you've been, yeah, I gotta put on more than that. I'll try it. Now
[14968.87s -> 14979.90s]  there's not enough on there. Put it down. Now let me see. Let me, let me do it. Eating this person.
[14979.90s -> 15004.84s]  Can you stop jumping, please? Oh, I like this zone. Castle. Why have you been obsessed with
[15004.84s -> 15017.27s]  sauce lately? Who made it? Who made the first sauce is really just when did civilization actually
[15017.27s -> 15028.97s]  begin? It's pretty much what that is. That's kind of what it is. Uh, where does this take me?
[15028.97s -> 15090.62s]  First thing. All right. All right. Well, that's good to know. Can you do a live yoga stream?
[15090.62s -> 15102.39s]  Dude, I'd pull a muscle and I would have to get taken out in a stretcher. So no, I would definitely
[15102.39s -> 15106.39s]  be, oh, here we go. It's time. We've got like a whole room full of people and like there's like
[15106.39s -> 15110.39s]  30, there's like 20 people in the yoga class, whatever. Oh, and there's the yoga instructor.
[15111.13s -> 15117.14s]  And we're going to do a bunch of made up yoga moves that aren't real. And that's like funny.
[15117.14s -> 15122.84s]  But at about 10 minutes into that stream, I'm going to go, oh, now we're going to do, um,
[15122.84s -> 15127.64s]  you know, uh, the, the twisted Turkey and it's going to be some dumb move. And I'm going to do
[15127.64s -> 15132.89s]  it. And I'm going to, you're going to see, I'm going to go, oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[15132.89s -> 15138.46s]  And I'm going to roll over my back and then you're going to go to a BRB screen for 25 minutes.
[15140.63s -> 15143.99s]  And then it's going to come back and there's going to be me being taken out in a stretcher
[15143.99s -> 15147.70s]  and somebody from the crew or somebody else that was there is going to be like, Hey, sorry,
[15147.70s -> 15152.62s]  buddy. But like, he pulled a fucking, he like tore a muscle on his knee or something or his leg.
[15152.62s -> 15155.90s]  And yeah, we're going to have to stop the stream. Like, see you next time. I don't know. He's
[15155.90s -> 15163.96s]  probably going to get, go to the doctor or something. That's why I don't want to do that stream.
[15163.96s -> 15198.33s]  You're going to spawn another train, bro. Where are you going? See, I saw it. There it is.
[15198.33s -> 15207.10s]  Make it Bugleberry's haunted yoga. This is a bunch of demons. People dressed up in like weird,
[15207.18s -> 15253.77s]  like fucking monster costumes. Like in the middle of the yoga class, the door
[15253.77s -> 15261.22s]  fucking burst open or like burst down. There's somebody like an adventurer being chased by like
[15261.22s -> 15264.98s]  a giant dragon or something or two or three enemies and just fighting in the middle of yoga
[15264.98s -> 15270.38s]  and Bugleberry doesn't give a shit. Nobody pays attention to it at all. It's just shit is going
[15270.38s -> 15281.03s]  down. Well, I don't know where we are. Like these monsters, like kill the adventure and start like,
[15281.51s -> 15291.05s]  eating them. We're not even paying attention. This just happens in this world. First is gold.
[15291.05s -> 15343.00s]  Yeah, that hurt a lot. Excuse me. Oh, sorry. That's a hard one. This, I don't know. My
[15343.00s -> 15350.17s]  grandfather built this place a hundred years ago. You probably need to add a zero, but I get what
[15350.17s -> 15389.38s]  you're saying. Nice. Cracked wall. True. These people, 15 health, I think is probably good.
[15389.38s -> 15399.48s]  Yeah. Hey dude, I couldn't help but notice that you haven't mentioned the fact that you spent
[15399.56s -> 15403.56s]  $75 on Family Guy, the mobile game you have to stream. What's what gives
[15403.56s -> 15417.19s]  it's you. Change makers often have good intentions, but they can't control the pain
[15417.19s -> 15423.91s]  their changes bring. You know, it's a cycle. I don't know about you, but I just want to stop
[15423.91s -> 15430.87s]  the suffering. Well, I'm a giver like that. The local great one was not a giver. He devoured
[15430.87s -> 15436.23s]  Nostal Gaia's memories from within the player housing mansion up above.
[15436.23s -> 15444.39s]  Desperate housing mansion. Oh, terrible things. And even the best of us. I know you can beat him.
[15445.93s -> 15469.88s]  I believe in you. Oh, it hurts. Don't act like you wouldn't click. Don't act like you're not
[15469.88s -> 15492.87s]  going to click to see what happens. Oh yeah. That's why you put all your points into luck
[15492.87s -> 15499.93s]  right there. All right. So where's the, where's progress across the hall? Maybe
[15500.49s -> 15509.91s]  well, greater the aggregate, everything. The emaciated toothpick felt the bite of
[15509.91s -> 15528.73s]  Nostal Gaia's hunger. Stop. You don't just restart the area. Just kill me. I got to go to the,
[15528.73s -> 15556.15s]  up into the left. Bad at video games, Andy. Just looking for that one crit. That's all you need.
[15568.66s -> 15586.30s]  2000 souls down here. Not a big deal. Like that. Like that. Do you like, uh, crepes? I do. I'm a
[15586.30s -> 15592.70s]  fan. I don't remember the last time I ate a crepe, but they're very good. You know what? I like,
[15593.75s -> 15600.94s]  somebody might call me a weirdo for this, but I don't think they will. I like savory crepes
[15601.58s -> 15607.54s]  more than sweet crepes. Please don't hurt me. Don't hurt me. You've reared your fist back.
[15607.54s -> 15613.45s]  You were going to punch me. I just saw you do that and relax. What's, what's wrong with you?
[15613.45s -> 15644.79s]  100% agree. Right. Confusion. Nice view. Nostalgia. I'm kind of curious. Does it? All
[15644.79s -> 15654.14s]  right. I need to know. Will it take a half of a second to follow the bottom? This is a research.
[15654.14s -> 15665.03s]  Is it going to take one 10th of a second to fall all the way? One, two, three, four. It's very far.
[15665.03s -> 15678.47s]  Okay. You've seen all the other times I've fallen off. It's like been a magnet fall joke for research.
[15678.47s -> 15718.36s]  Yeah. I got it. Can I bypass this person? All joke hypothesis. Yeah. You get it. Oh,
[15718.36s -> 15728.23s]  shit. It's you. Oh my, I am a failure. What happened? They do not want me. Look at me.
[15728.23s -> 15737.53s]  They do not want any of us. Nearly heroes are with the unproven, the unnamed. We follow in the
[15737.53s -> 15748.34s]  footsteps of the greatest protagonists ever conceived. Why fail? I now realize we are only
[15748.34s -> 15756.31s]  here to confirm our value. It wasn't I who vanquished the darkness in those minds.
[15756.31s -> 15764.81s]  We both know it on the balcony above. I faced a foe. I could not best. She was fast and filled
[15764.81s -> 15771.13s]  with conviction though. I did not recognize her story. She threw me down with the skill of someone
[15771.13s -> 15776.17s]  whose story should be well known. I can handle this. Go. And I were separated when I charged
[15776.17s -> 15784.78s]  into the confrontation. Be wary. If you go forth, I will stay here to be forgotten. The nothing that
[15784.78s -> 15791.02s]  I am wrote. Give any idea how much money I've put into this game. This sword alone is worth
[15791.02s -> 15804.04s]  probably 15 to 1600 dollars. I'm going to be just fine. You wish to uplift me heroic quest in itself.
[15804.12s -> 15814.52s]  It's futile friend. I am no hero. Whoa, wait a minute. I have a shield of inspiration.
[15814.52s -> 15824.71s]  Should I give it to him? Yeah, sure. What is that a relic? You would have me remember myself through,
[15824.71s -> 15841.69s]  but it can't even remember itself. You wish it's few. Okay, so I need to remember the shield
[15841.69s -> 15852.47s]  heart flow altar. So that's in the first area. So I have to get the memory from the shield,
[15852.47s -> 15863.53s]  bring it back here, give it to this guy. I wonder what that is. Should I go look for it? That's way
[15863.53s -> 15873.05s]  back. Too much work. Well, I feel like this is part two of this quest and I kind of feel like
[15873.05s -> 15879.10s]  I want to do it. Yeah, why not? I want to do it. I have no idea where I'm going. Can somebody just
[15879.10s -> 15886.34s]  tell me, can somebody give me exact directions? And I'm talking like walk forward five seconds,
[15886.34s -> 15890.50s]  turn left, walk forward five seconds, turn right, walk forward 10 seconds to give me all the way
[15890.50s -> 15899.66s]  back. It'd be like really helpful. I'm going to try it. See if I can know where the hell I'm going.
[15899.66s -> 15918.28s]  I need to tether though, take a ride at the taco bell. Let me tether here. It's back where you first
[15918.28s -> 15936.68s]  met that old man. Okay, so I'm here in the theater. All right. Uh, I'm to backtrack. There is that
[15936.68s -> 15943.00s]  elevator, right? Which brings me out. Yeah, let's go back. I want to see what happens. I might get a
[15943.00s -> 15981.18s]  cool item or something. If I was an item over here. I can't get it. Can you fast travel? I don't know.
[15981.18s -> 15994.71s]  That's a good question. Maybe I can. That's a great question. Okay, we're not quite there. I need to
[15994.71s -> 16004.04s]  go back even further. You can only TP to your tether. All right. So I remember going, oh,
[16004.04s -> 16030.15s]  shoot. It's a boss. It's through here. Let's get out of this way here. Um, okay. I remember this.
[16030.15s -> 16046.57s]  Now we go back here. Uh huh. This is where the old man was sitting. Is it here? No, we're all the
[16046.57s -> 16080.76s]  way back here. That's not the tutorial zone. Is it? Where did I first meet that guy? It's right after
[16080.76s -> 16105.22s]  the tutorial. So right here, this game feels like a, like just dance 2016. All right, here we are.
[16105.22s -> 16128.22s]  And we're in this zone. Come on. What does it say? My siblings and I encouraged pledging heroes
[16128.22s -> 16133.02s]  through their doubts and toward their purpose. Purpose ultimately found rest in the style guy's
[16133.02s -> 16144.71s]  heart somewhere beneath her central shrine. So under low, how do I get under here? Oh, wait a
[16144.71s -> 16183.72s]  minute. How do I get down there? Okay. Right here. Yep. Remember. Very cool. All right. So
[16183.72s -> 16201.22s]  now I can, how do I teleport back? Do I have an item? This one is a multiplayer. Oh, okay. Cool.
[16201.22s -> 16222.07s]  Reminds me of a midi evil for the original PlayStation. I could see that. That'd give us
[16222.07s -> 16258.57s]  you. You can't be serious. Stop. Oh my goodness. I just want to complete the quest. Yep. Well,
[16258.57s -> 16316.97s]  I know where I'm going. No more stamina. I already, I'm just getting absolutely just dominated by
[16316.97s -> 16344.44s]  these people. Okay. All right, let's go. Hey dude, I'm trying to do surgery on somebody. Can you
[16344.44s -> 16357.16s]  please keep it down? I'm just in the operating room. All right. Here we go. You wish to uplift
[16357.16s -> 16372.81s]  me. It's you. What is that? This is thank you. Thank you. Fellow hero. We are heroes. We, we
[16372.81s -> 16386.42s]  together. Our company defines us. Yes, I am the great self named nameless Nero. As with my title,
[16386.50s -> 16394.90s]  so too am I the determiner of my actions. Thank you, friend. I shall don this with pride.
[16394.90s -> 16399.78s]  For was it not I who vanquished the darkness deep within the minds?
[16403.85s -> 16413.10s]  It's true. You did do that. Soon. I shall resume my quest. I will be immortalized in the pantheon of
[16413.10s -> 16420.06s]  heroes. You'll be there too. I think. Hope so. Soon you'll be. All right. We make progress.
[16420.06s -> 16435.78s]  See you in the next random spot. You're going to be standing. The irredeemable sliver persisted
[16435.78s -> 16448.23s]  onward witnessing what nostalgy might once have been and what it had become. Here wings. You are
[16448.23s -> 16468.17s]  a weirdo. Hey, I'm currently watching this on a roller coaster. Can you please keep it up? Like,
[16468.17s -> 16481.72s]  turn it up. Memory of an NPC zone boss. That's funny. Watching like YouTube shorts on a
[16481.72s -> 16489.83s]  roller coaster is, I think, peak 2023. Don't you think? I mean, this is not a YouTube short, but
[16490.39s -> 16499.16s]  you know, you get it. Watching a Twitch stream is like, no, what do you think? It's a gamer joke.
[16499.16s -> 16516.04s]  Why'd you say YouTube shorts? Because you guys watch YouTube shorts, don't you? No. Is YouTube
[16516.04s -> 16532.68s]  shorts the not cool one? You guys watch TikTok? Yes. Yes. Oh, fuck. I'm going to be relatable
[16532.68s -> 16552.60s]  to the younger generation and I screwed it up. Shit. Get off me. Blood of a blood of a blood
[16552.60s -> 16585.70s]  of a blood. What is that? Applies recursion. Nice try. Brain piercer. Let's try it again. Wait,
[16585.70s -> 16618.55s]  I hear something flying. Lucky hit. Why does everybody bite you? Oh, how do I get over there?
[16619.19s -> 16645.48s]  I think we're almost at the boss. Something terrible ahead. Oh, it's a toilet. You know,
[16645.48s -> 16655.88s]  my buddy stopped watching the stream. L plus U fell off. I just imagine you sitting in a Discord
[16655.88s -> 16666.95s]  call with a friend. You're both watching the stream and this friend is just like, oh, yeah,
[16666.95s -> 16673.54s]  I don't know. I'm not a big fan of Germany anymore. Nah, I like I'm out of here. Maybe if
[16673.54s -> 16682.30s]  you want to play like fucking like a battle of vapex, whatever the fucking game is, just let me
[16682.30s -> 16688.30s]  know tomorrow or whatever. And you know what? It's hard to talk and play at the same time a
[16688.30s -> 16701.69s]  game like this. So never mind. But why would you be? Never mind. I don't even know what I said.
[16701.69s -> 16750.31s]  There's a gun. It's just trash. Stupid. Your job is to talk and play games. You know how hard it
[16750.31s -> 16761.35s]  is to talk and do anything? Hey, you know what? My job is whatever I want it to be. How does that
[16761.35s -> 16766.01s]  sound? Sometimes I do a comb stream where I just comb my hair. Is that a video game? No.
[16766.81s -> 16789.82s]  Sometimes I'm on camera doing something. Is that playing a game? No. He's rebelling. Yes. Yeah,
[16789.82s -> 16805.05s]  I am. Yeah, let's go. I'm rebelling. I'm afraid of this room. I can't imagine you on camera.
[16805.05s -> 16822.34s]  It's gross. You don't want to see it. This thing's just wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[16822.34s -> 16856.33s]  wait. The ground is moving. This is a lot nicer toilet. Oh, look at failure. Oh, it's Sonic the
[16856.33s -> 16873.10s]  Hedgehog. Cute. Funny. That's a cute little reference. I'm okay. Somebody was in the doorway,
[16873.10s -> 16875.90s]  but I don't want to go that way because I think that's the boss. And I want to try to see if
[16875.90s -> 16884.92s]  there's anything over here I can find, like a bonfire that I can get level up with. And I'm
[16884.92s -> 16898.36s]  thinking that's probably down here. Scope cutter. Wait. Oh, it's the Assassin's Creed Unity person.
[16898.36s -> 16905.21s]  You have a different weapon. Peculiar world, isn't it? Nero confronted a woman upon the tower
[16905.21s -> 16913.42s]  behind us. He fell, but he wasn't broken. What? The being he fought was, I'm not sure. I think
[16913.42s -> 16919.82s]  she's connected to something larger. She's not forgotten. That's for sure. Though I worry for
[16919.82s -> 16930.39s]  Nero, I think it's time our paths diverge. Oh, no. I met a creature. It called itself the Reservoir
[16930.39s -> 16938.54s]  of Pain. It had a generous smile, but a heavy heart. It gave me this blade as a gift. I think
[16938.54s -> 16944.78s]  it feels Nostalgaia's suffering in a profound way, but also yearns to ease that suffering.
[16946.73s -> 16953.32s]  I can imagine nothing more heroic. Can you? I need to wear better clothes. I look like a fucking
[16953.32s -> 16961.24s]  dickhead. Sometimes I feel to try and understand it all like like a finger staring at its hand
[16961.24s -> 16968.44s]  or its arm or its whole body. A thing trying to glean its purpose from the thing it is a part of.
[16968.44s -> 16974.60s]  Though my body lacks much sense at all. So perhaps I've spun a feudal metaphor.
[16975.82s -> 16979.42s]  Voice work is really good in this game. Actually pretty surprising that it is
[16979.42s -> 16985.34s]  considering it's, you know, sometimes that's the last thing that an indie developer thinks about is
[16985.34s -> 16994.82s]  stuff like that. But it's very, very, very good. Everything's very well done. Feels very good to
[16994.82s -> 17003.96s]  play. I can imagine a lot of times if you're an indie game developer and you make this game and
[17003.96s -> 17011.53s]  it's like, oh shit, I have to, I have to hire a bunch of voice acting or, you know, however it
[17011.53s -> 17024.25s]  works, I guess like an expense. Okay, Roger Ebert, play the game. What the fuck? I am. What are you
[17024.25s -> 17035.29s]  talking about? I'm so, that tells it to me so much. Oh, hey, isn't it your, isn't it your job to play
[17035.29s -> 17040.49s]  games? Let's talk about like something in the industry. Hey, no, don't do that. Don't do it.
[17040.49s -> 17053.80s]  I don't want to hear you say anything about that. All right, now I'm going to die because I'm not
[17053.80s -> 17063.86s]  paying attention. I'm dead. I'm dead. And I blame that person for that. Let's have like a conversation
[17063.86s -> 17076.89s]  about like, you know, the industry. In the mod chat right now, I'm surprised your chat knows who
[17076.89s -> 17097.86s]  Roger Ebert even is. Yeah. All right. I got to get over there before I lose all my souls.
[17098.42s -> 17119.14s]  Sometimes the stream feels like how long can 10,000 people bully a 40 year old man
[17119.14s -> 17129.16s]  until he turns his stream off? I, I do not agree. I don't agree. What you said was funny,
[17129.16s -> 17144.30s]  but I disagree. You've got to be kidding me. And I had an opportunity right there.
[17145.02s -> 17160.50s]  There we go. You see that flourish. Yeah. You see that snap right there at the end.
[17160.50s -> 17171.67s]  Did you see that snap finish? That was actually bullshit. That was like a double animation.
[17175.03s -> 17197.67s]  Cherries. Where did I even die? I hate Jerma. I hope he reads my comment and gets sad in that
[17197.67s -> 17209.50s]  person. You know what? How does this sound in that person for an hour? Yeah. But one full hour,
[17213.13s -> 17229.35s]  one full hour, and then let them repent and then reduce it five minutes.
[17229.91s -> 17248.26s]  Be please land because you just land and mess everything up. Oh my God. That move is so annoying.
[17249.06s -> 17280.50s]  I'm just running. No, I need my shit. Hold on. What is this? You tell me this was right here
[17280.50s -> 17303.11s]  the whole time. God damn it. This is one of those Superman all arcade games. What does that mean?
[17303.11s -> 17318.02s]  I had the exact same question. Am I missing something? Do I like butterscotch? I do.
[17318.02s -> 17326.09s]  Butterscotch is good only in very, very small doses though. You can really overdo butterscotch
[17326.09s -> 17337.54s]  and it'll ruin everything. All right. Let me go on out here. It's like pesto. Yeah, that's true.
[17338.10s -> 17351.26s]  Butterscotch on ice cream, just straight up vanilla bean ice cream with butterscotch hot.
[17351.26s -> 17358.87s]  Then you let that rest and then you eat it after it kind of solidifies a little.
[17358.87s -> 17364.36s]  You know what I'm talking about? When it gets to that point where it sort of
[17365.18s -> 17380.70s]  becomes one with the ice cream drizzled. Let me out. I want to get that item. Whatever.
[17380.70s -> 17388.49s]  And then I don't even get me talking about this. At the very end, you have this weird mixture at
[17388.49s -> 17402.79s]  the bottom of the cup. It's this weird fucked up liquid, isn't it? Super Mario Castle? It's this
[17402.79s -> 17416.82s]  weird, weird liquid that's kind of, if you know, you know, it's kind of runny ice cream, but
[17416.82s -> 17429.21s]  weirdly solidified almost butterscotch bits. And it's probably the best part. Where did I die?
[17429.21s -> 17460.52s]  Where did I die? Right there. Shot. So sloppy. Okay. I just looked over a chat and somebody said,
[17460.52s -> 17464.63s]  take those boxes off now. And I was going to ban you. I was going to have you get banned
[17464.63s -> 17467.43s]  because I was like, what the fuck are you talking about? And I'm like, wait, right.
[17467.43s -> 17478.09s]  I was about to be like, yeah, big ban. This person's being a weirdo. Like, what the fuck
[17478.09s -> 17487.64s]  are they talking about? And they go, right. Okay. But you are right. Okay. What's my total weight?
[17487.64s -> 17542.47s]  That's actually not bad. Coward. Coward. Coward. Dead in one hit. Jesus. Almost there. Shut up.
[17542.47s -> 17550.71s]  There's no way. Spear enemies are the worst in any video game. Doesn't matter what it is.
[17550.71s -> 17557.05s]  Across all platforms, across all genres, across all console generations, across every game,
[17557.05s -> 17562.65s]  across every arcade cabinet, across every dice game. It doesn't matter what it is across every
[17562.65s -> 17569.05s]  tabletop game. It doesn't matter what it is. Spear enemies are the worst enemies in all media
[17569.05s -> 17593.56s]  because spears are superior to swords. Yeah. We all saw, we all saw that history channel video
[17593.56s -> 17604.73s]  or show like who would win samurai or a medieval warrior. We've all seen it and we all know that
[17604.73s -> 17627.22s]  spear is the best weapon. We all saw that the samurai lost to the caveman. Caveman have club
[17627.22s -> 17632.58s]  and raw chicken. And that's, I mean, we all saw it. And then it was the tier list they made and
[17632.58s -> 17638.33s]  the caveman came out on top every time. It was weird because they even went as far as to, what
[17638.33s -> 17644.36s]  was it? They did like modern stuff too. And the caveman beat modern military person with weapons
[17644.36s -> 17653.67s]  like guns and stuff, which is, I don't know how strange. I think it's just the force that a caveman
[17653.67s -> 17659.24s]  could swing a club. It was like 600,000 pounds per square inch or something, something crazy,
[17659.24s -> 17675.13s]  more than like a dinosaur jaw. That didn't happen. You're an idiot. Well, what did I watch then?
[17675.13s -> 17680.38s]  What did I watch then? Huh? What did I watch? I'm being weird tonight. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[17680.38s -> 17726.74s]  You got to put these stupid, I hate being up on these rafters. Come on. What worth it? Not really.
[17726.74s -> 17739.38s]  Do I have any heels? Cherry. Oh, brain piercer. I can, oh wait, I got multiple memories here.
[17739.38s -> 17763.13s]  Quack strut, pixelating cane, concealing a telescoping blade. This is a dex weapon.
[17763.13s -> 17787.08s]  Joust. I mean, this is a sorceress, a sorcery weapon, whatever. Is that it? Is there any more?
[17787.08s -> 17803.48s]  I'm really interested in this one. Where is it? Quack strut. I really hope I was, I think I,
[17803.48s -> 17818.65s]  I think I'm all right. This thing is awesome. I want this. All right. So this is, yep,
[17818.65s -> 17830.89s]  is the plan. This is a, like a poke. This is a slash. I think this is the right call. This is
[17830.89s -> 17864.01s]  a spear. It's a sharp weapon. Wristless tooth. I hate those things. Um, there's more to do in here.
[17864.01s -> 17890.90s]  I need, I need, when you're talking about me having no health, that's when you're talking,
[17890.90s -> 17894.34s]  you know, when you're talking about having no health, right? That's what I'm talking about.
[17894.34s -> 17916.47s]  When you're talking about the damage sucks ass, but it doesn't matter what's in my main hand.
[17916.47s -> 17956.71s]  Anyways, all my upgrades in my offhand. Shit. You know what? Just play it safe. There is an item
[17956.71s -> 17998.54s]  over here. And is that an NPC? Holy shit. Everything's fine. I'm, I, I think I died.
[17998.54s -> 18004.31s]  No, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't want to fight. I don't want to fight you.
[18004.31s -> 18021.59s]  I don't want to, don't fucking come at me. That's the only thing I could think of.
[18021.59s -> 18036.20s]  Okay. Thank God. So what is the item? There's another person too. Holy shit. That went right
[18036.20s -> 18059.66s]  by my face and I got grabbed. I tried so hard. It was so stressful because I knew I was backing up
[18059.66s -> 18063.80s]  into the wall and I didn't know where the staircase was behind me. Something shit.
[18063.80s -> 18072.87s]  I don't know how far back I can go. Oh, I don't know how far I am. I'm just going to run. This
[18072.87s -> 18078.65s]  is actually, no, no, no. I got the, um, I got the shortcut here. Not as bad as it could be.
[18078.65s -> 18097.35s]  That show was called Deadliest Warrior. Yeah. Why can't I, Deadliest War, Deadliest War we're,
[18097.35s -> 18123.11s]  why am I saying like Deadliest Warrior? It's not that far. This thing is cool. Should I,
[18123.11s -> 18142.55s]  should I upgrade the cane? This is the wrong way, isn't it? This guy stinks. Oh, by the way,
[18142.55s -> 18148.30s]  tomorrow, if you did not know, I mentioned it in the beginning of the stream, but let's bring it
[18148.30s -> 18157.26s]  up again. Tomorrow is a sponsored stream. I'm going to be playing Wild Hearts, Monster Hunter
[18157.26s -> 18170.98s]  kind of game. It seems pretty fun. And I believe I'll be playing it with Vinny. So that should be
[18170.98s -> 18182.66s]  fun. This actually was a pretty good question. I'm going to, I'm going to answer it. I kind of,
[18182.66s -> 18190.18s]  I can't alt tab. Um, somebody asked, that's not a bad question. What do you do genuinely if a game
[18190.18s -> 18199.43s]  sucks? That's a good question. I'm going to answer it as best as I can in about five minutes when
[18199.43s -> 18209.56s]  this room is clear. Spear is such a bad weapon. Honestly, give me a club. Shit was way better,
[18209.56s -> 18214.73s]  way stronger. Just huge surface area to just hit somebody in the fucking face with. So much better
[18214.73s -> 18248.41s]  than a spear. Give me a huge club. Almost there. Now you land. All right, go ahead and do it,
[18248.41s -> 18259.40s]  please. You're just not going to do it. You're just going to die. Um, what do you do if a game
[18259.40s -> 18267.53s]  sucks? There's a couple of options there. So if a game, when you say sucks, you mean the game is
[18267.53s -> 18273.34s]  genuinely bad. Like I can't, I cannot stomach even playing it anymore. Then I will, I won't,
[18273.34s -> 18280.22s]  I'll stop. I'll move on to something else. If a game sucks just barely enough, I will typically
[18280.22s -> 18287.48s]  stay with it. Cause you never know when a kind of a dumpy game gets, might actually get really fun.
[18287.48s -> 18293.46s]  There's definitely been opportunities where I thought the game wasn't that fun. Then an hour
[18293.46s -> 18300.84s]  goes by and it's, I'm having a great time. Very, very good example of this was Dark and Darker.
[18300.84s -> 18305.16s]  Uh, the first hour or two, Dark and Darker, I was like, this game is fucking an ass. Why do
[18305.16s -> 18310.71s]  people play this? And I may have stopped, but I kind of played it for a little longer. And it
[18310.71s -> 18313.51s]  was like, no, no, no, wait a minute. This is actually really fun. I really, really like this.
[18313.51s -> 18321.14s]  This is awesome. You gotta be careful. You don't know if the game actually sucks or not, or if
[18321.14s -> 18330.34s]  you're just not giving it the time and the kind of brain power that it deserves. You never know.
[18330.34s -> 18339.19s]  And also everybody has such different opinions on stuff that a game that I say sucks. Oh,
[18339.19s -> 18353.08s]  this game's ass. What a terrible fucking game. This might be your favorite game of all time.
[18353.08s -> 18369.74s]  Right? Like it could be a thing that you really, really enjoy. So many different opinions. What's
[18369.74s -> 18377.67s]  the time tomorrow? Oh, same time. Probably around six. This is the way to get in here. Uh huh.
[18377.67s -> 18395.80s]  Where, where did I, I don't know. Where did I die down? No, I came through this way. No,
[18395.80s -> 18404.07s]  I never got the item. That's right. I died in here. This is going to be really stupid and really bad
[18404.07s -> 18458.94s]  idea, but I don't care. Where's my shit. Goodbye. Was there anything else in here? Shit. I have to
[18458.94s -> 18510.74s]  go that way. See you get down to the bottom. Almost there. Ooh. All right. Important. Wait,
[18510.74s -> 18550.07s]  anything, anything vibrating? Oh, come on. This staircase just fucking ruined everything, dude.
[18550.87s -> 18560.15s]  Why everybody ran all the own? Oh, that's bad. That's very bad. That's so bad. I'm so fucked
[18560.15s -> 18578.41s]  here. Wizard, help. Wizard, please. They're all just single file. Dude, help. Oh my goodness. Okay.
[18578.41s -> 18589.53s]  I need to do this so much faster than me because he has to, he drank my fucking fluid. So whatever
[18589.53s -> 18643.30s]  it was, there's no way. Nope. I have to be a total coward here. I'm sorry. It's scary. It's
[18643.30s -> 18671.37s]  intense. I'm sorry. Jeez. Okay. Everything's fine. That was gnarly. I just don't want to run all the
[18671.37s -> 18706.42s]  way back here. Hey, we're not doing Bugleberry's yoga class yet. All right. Very, very cool.
[18706.42s -> 18746.28s]  Whoa. I didn't even see that. Way too much to lose. Hmm. Do you think? All right. Now let me
[18746.28s -> 18767.32s]  actually pay attention to what, uh, I feel like they might be stuff blowing in here. Tooth? No.
[18767.32s -> 18781.32s]  Staying in a regen on parry. Please tell me everything you just said again. You've put the
[18781.32s -> 18790.66s]  show as your answers or has the struggle to discover been taken from you? Have you been
[18791.30s -> 18801.13s]  gifted direction? Hmm. For my part, I seem to remember more as you struggle. There's value in
[18801.13s -> 18809.37s]  that struggle. In struggle. I'm certain of it. The past, even in its pain, gives meaning to the
[18809.37s -> 18816.65s]  future. I wonder, you have no doubt seen the flickering doors throughout Nostalgia. They are
[18816.65s -> 18823.45s]  chasms with no path forward because they hold no memory of what they were. What might happen
[18824.17s -> 18830.25s]  if you offered memory back to these, these forgetting spaces? Why don't you try
[18832.39s -> 18837.91s]  it? It can be restored. Offering some of your collected memory. Place your stick arm on this
[18837.91s -> 18851.91s]  flickering door. You gotta pay. That's it? 50 memory. That's nothing. Like two, that's two quarters. Oh.
[18852.71s -> 18866.79s]  I expected as much. Tis not only objects that are forgetting themselves in Nostalgia. Her
[18866.87s -> 18879.38s]  hostile denizens may also be affected by your generosity. Your weaponless stick arms do more
[18879.38s -> 18883.22s]  damage. They also have other effects. For example, try punching an enemy's shield.
[18884.25s -> 18914.47s]  Wait, what do you mean? Unarmed playthrough? Oh, there's another playthrough. That's cool.
[18914.47s -> 18921.19s]  The past and future are inseparable. The future cannot be interpreted without the
[18921.19s -> 18928.07s]  context of the past. And if the past is meaningful, it is only so because of the
[18928.07s -> 18938.18s]  future it enables. Your own meaning, hero, is becoming clearer to me. Restore our memory,
[18938.18s -> 18951.80s]  personal, as much as pragmatic request. Restore. I will try. You gave back the useless, ugly
[18951.80s -> 18979.75s]  abomination gave back. One of those pothead people. I'm dead instantly. I died in one hit.
[18979.75s -> 19018.42s]  This is so far. And it was 18,000. Wait, I did get a shortcut. I forget where it is. I unlocked it.
[19018.42s -> 19032.62s]  Ah, it's too late. I don't know where it is. I don't remember. It was right next to the
[19032.62s -> 19048.28s]  bonfire. Ah, whatever. We want you to be scared more. You don't get to demand anything from me.
[19048.28s -> 19096.14s]  No more demands. How does that sound? It's gonna run. I just aggroed everything here for no reason.
[19096.14s -> 19154.33s]  There it is. I'm coming. Be there shortly. Hitbox on that is just broken. All right, where am I
[19154.33s -> 19159.99s]  going? There's like, there's three ways for me to go. There's this way, which is where the pothead is,
[19159.99s -> 19177.82s]  and then there's up through there. Should I fight the pothead? Don't even start with this bullshit.
[19177.82s -> 19195.16s]  Oh, you're so annoying. Back off. Shortcut is through that door. All right. All right, round two.
[19195.16s -> 19247.02s]  Let's, uh, win by cheating. Oh my god, you kill. I just crit your weapon. That was stupid. Anti-hero
[19247.02s -> 19297.61s]  establishment. Anything glowing? No. New area that way. Gems and jewels. Chasm ahead. Wow, look at
[19297.61s -> 19325.69s]  hilarious thing. I want to see the funny thing. Where is it? What is it? Quest reward vault.
[19327.00s -> 19334.26s]  Imagine if you can being strung to a thing which you love, but which you cannot save.
[19335.06s -> 19348.95s]  Hmm. Imagination requires depth scribble. Five of these can be remembered. Nothing in this room.
[19354.39s -> 19379.74s]  Weird. Why do I, it sounds like glintstone. Sure it is. Conversion of it. Oh, wait. How much?
[19379.74s -> 19395.62s]  A thousand bucks to open this. Better be worth it. Unburdened. Another one. Okay. Strength and
[19395.62s -> 19408.78s]  dex. All right. Is there a bonfire down here? Not. Does the game have powers dancing? It
[19408.78s -> 19423.42s]  actually might. Fuck that. I'm just going into the vault. They can fight each other for all I care.
[19423.42s -> 19443.74s]  Oh, not you again. All right. What is it? Oh, a lot of anguish out there, isn't there, good buddy?
[19443.74s -> 19452.14s]  Oh, geez. Yeah, there is. Oh, remember that sweet sword I gave you? Powerful, right? I can give you
[19452.14s -> 19458.94s]  more powerful artifacts. All you have to do is bring me the relics you find that are burdened
[19458.94s -> 19467.26s]  with memories. I can absorb their suffering. Their longing. So you don't need to solve their
[19467.26s -> 19474.38s]  mysteries. Instead, you'll get to wield super duper awesome versions of them to beat up whatever
[19474.38s -> 19481.98s]  bad guys you chase. And their liberated husks won't have any memories left to burden you with.
[19481.98s -> 19494.12s]  Win. Wait, what? Unburdened. Unburdened relics are stronger, but lose their lore and special
[19494.12s -> 19514.20s]  ability. This cannot be undone. Oh, you turn it in. You probably can go the other way. I'm
[19514.20s -> 19518.28s]  imagining there's somebody in the game that can. Because I have three weapons that are unburdened
[19518.28s -> 19526.26s]  already. Just for pure damage. Yeah. I mean, that's kind of. Maybe I should just do it to this. Do I
[19526.26s -> 19534.18s]  really care what this does? Don't do it. Lore is important. It can't be, cannot be undone. So, oh,
[19541.16s -> 19565.51s]  five thousand bucks. Sure. What a waste of money. But is this, does this get consumed?
[19565.51s -> 19576.82s]  Is it, can I just put it on or is it like a talisman? I'm afraid to use it. Oh, how did I
[19576.82s -> 19590.73s]  not even look down here? Oops. I haven't even looked down here. Uh, health regen.
[19592.12s -> 19601.98s]  Probably dexterity. Yeah, how much is that? 20 decks. That's a lot. How much is that giving me?
[19601.98s -> 19615.86s]  That's five decks. Oh my goodness. That's a lot. Okay. Nice. Don't you play games for a living?
[19618.71s -> 19646.82s]  No, I don't. How could I? Okay. What else is out here? Crown of the undone. New hat.
[19646.82s -> 19660.42s]  A pixelating warlock's crown. The murders of my NPC retaliated where his corpses were dumped.
[19660.42s -> 19679.77s]  Uh, in the World of Warcraft cave? 8.1 and 11. What does degradation mean? I think this thing's
[19679.77s -> 19701.83s]  just better. Very interesting. I'm going to keep moving. I hope there's a bonfire. Easy maker key.
[19702.39s -> 19724.17s]  A key to a crate of smuggled easy maker goods. What is that? Depths. Oh, this is another shortcut
[19724.17s -> 19741.48s]  somewhere. Good game design, but try patience. Is that a joke? Is that making fun of the game?
[19741.48s -> 19769.34s]  Try patience. What? Oh, wait, this wraps back into here. Okay. No. What is this? Some kind of
[19769.34s -> 19784.38s]  currency thing? Quest reward vault. Wasn't there a door in the starting area that was flickering?
[19784.38s -> 19817.78s]  I think you're right. That's one way. That sound is getting louder. You know what's kind of cool
[19817.78s -> 19827.48s]  about this game? It's scratching that from software itch. It just is actually very well made.
[19827.88s -> 19863.43s]  This is like really good. It's cool. This is a cool game. What's wrong with my weapon? What's wrong with
[19863.43s -> 19899.11s]  my weapon? Why am I holding my weapon so weird? Um, why am I holding it like this? I like this area.
[19899.11s -> 19920.92s]  Didn't see me, right? All right. The play here is wait till he turns around. Go turn it on and
[19920.92s -> 19939.48s]  everybody will kill him. That's the plan. Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight,
[19939.48s -> 19969.26s]  fight. Everybody come out and fight. Fight. Yeah. Chaos. Chaos. Chaos. Oh shit. You all did it.
[19969.26s -> 20006.17s]  Uh, I'm in trouble. I need to heal. Fridge. What is it? Bucko blade. Bucko blade. This is
[20006.17s -> 20014.50s]  definitely strength. Yeah. A pixelating really, really, really big sword. My wielder was frequently
[20014.50s -> 20048.06s]  sized up at a place where being stung was sought as a delight. Little pink guy. This is so dangerous
[20048.06s -> 20089.02s]  right now. Get me out of here. They're following me. How did all of you make it out alive? He didn't
[20089.02s -> 20096.47s]  kill one person. He's the hugest guy in this whole dungeon. How are you? Every single one of you is
[20096.47s -> 20105.02s]  alive. Oh, there's a wall. There's a wall. There's a wall. Holy shit. I almost got hit. My heart just
[20105.02s -> 20111.69s]  like stopped. My game, my game went down. I have to use the, okay. I have to, I'm using the literally
[20111.69s -> 20124.17s]  the OBS preview to play the game. My game minimized. I can't see anything. It's on the OBS preview.
[20124.17s -> 20134.71s]  Oh my God. How do I pause it? What happened? What? That was okay. That was insane. I don't
[20134.71s -> 20145.29s]  think you even saw that. That didn't translate it. My game went down. How many layers are in this
[20145.29s -> 20158.49s]  fucking dungeon? Nobody saw it. Weird. My game went down. Oh, I'm putting this on. It's like, relax.
[20171.45s -> 20194.98s]  Geez. Right. Oh my goodness. This like hurts my head. And if you see, I think so. Finally,
[20194.98s -> 20205.74s]  time for old blade to face the chasm. No, wait, you don't serve my captors. You're one of us.
[20207.54s -> 20211.70s]  Never thought I'd meet a young spawn again. Yeah, it looks like I think it is dragon slayer.
[20214.62s -> 20227.03s]  No, I had pressed it accidentally. Everything's fine. Face the chasm. No, what a sad ending. That
[20227.03s -> 20235.59s]  would have been... Oh, I'm sorry. One of us. Never thought I'd meet a young spawn again. My game
[20235.59s -> 20249.21s]  went down. I lost my courage, see? Lost my heroic icon with it. Listen, I can tell you're a good kid.
[20249.21s -> 20257.02s]  I've sent enough heroes to know. If you find my icon out there, maybe, could you return it to me?
[20257.10s -> 20263.26s]  I want to be meaningful again before this whole thing ends. Do we have it already?
[20266.17s -> 20269.45s]  Ain't no reason for me to leave this cell. I'm meaningless.
[20270.41s -> 20274.97s]  Honey, if they'd have thrown me in the chasm, at least there'd be no memory of my shame.
[20276.25s -> 20283.24s]  Get out there and save the day. Ain't no reason. If they'd have... You still got heroism in you,
[20283.24s -> 20302.94s]  kid. I can tell. Get out there. Do we not have his item? Well, somebody will... One of you guys
[20302.94s -> 20312.49s]  please remember where this is. Fuck, I will not. Dude, you're a walking Christmas tree.
[20313.13s -> 20322.02s]  I think I look pretty cool. This is bad, and I think I'm going to...
[20323.16s -> 20332.38s]  Uh, hmm. I think the plan is to just take one of the... Yeah, I'm gonna... Uh-huh. Uh, yeah.
[20335.99s -> 20351.70s]  Maybe another time. You went really far back. Um, it's really not. End of the stream, voice?
[20356.15s -> 20360.44s]  Yeah, it's probably a good place to stop. What the fuck? Why'd that guy say that? Don't tell
[20360.44s -> 20369.10s]  the teacher we have homework. We are going to finish this. You will see this game be completed.
[20372.06s -> 20394.74s]  Because I think it's really, really good. 28 luck. Something new. Healing costs nothing. Yeah. Uh,
[20395.56s -> 20401.72s]  from what I have gathered, I believe there's only probably... I think we're about halfway.
[20401.72s -> 20408.07s]  The game's about 10 to 15 hours, depending on how slow you play. I don't know about completionist
[20408.07s -> 20413.94s]  stuff, but it's probably like 12 to 15 hours. I, uh, I would love to finish it. I think it's great.
[20414.58s -> 20422.82s]  But that is not what is happening tomorrow. Although, it might. It might happen after.
[20422.82s -> 20430.15s]  Tomorrow, I'm going to be playing Wild Hearts, sponsored. First sponsored stream of the year.
[20430.15s -> 20435.37s]  It's been about three months or so. Looks really fun. I'm looking forward to it. Hey!
[20438.33s -> 20453.10s]  Somebody... I am so sorry. But yeah, uh, Vinny and I are going to be playing it. I think that's the
[20453.10s -> 20457.99s]  idea. If there is any changes or any updates, I will let you know. Keep an eye on the sus. That's
[20457.99s -> 20464.78s]  the plan for tomorrow at 6 PM. And after that, I might just come back into this. We'll see. Or
[20464.78s -> 20470.78s]  maybe we'll play that. Vinny and I might play it for longer. I don't know. We will figure that out
[20470.78s -> 20477.48s]  tomorrow. But that's the plan. Sponsored stream tomorrow. And see you later. Can you give it a
[20477.48s -> 20487.50s]  rating yet? Um, I don't think you can. I don't know. You can't rate some stuff. I would tell you that
[20487.50s -> 20500.42s]  this is worth playing. It's, it's very good. I very much enjoy this game. In fact, I think it's great.
[20500.42s -> 20505.38s]  But I don't know. Oh, it's an uh, it's an eight. It's an 8.3. Nah, it's just great. It's just a great
[20505.38s -> 20513.14s]  game. That's all you need to know. It seems like there's a lot of kind of depth somehow, even though
[20513.14s -> 20524.34s]  it's like a parody game. It's very, very good. Plays very well. Runs very well. It's voice acting.
[20524.34s -> 20530.98s]  The story seems pretty, I'm, I'm engaged. I would like to know what's going on. I think it's great.
[20530.98s -> 20540.63s]  There you go. Is my review in progress. I think it's great. And with that, I'll see you guys
[20540.63s -> 20551.70s]  tomorrow. 6 PM Pacific. Let's check out Wild Hearts. Very cool. Do I have to save it or anything?
[20551.70s -> 20561.91s]  Yes. Okay. There we go. Uh huh. See you tomorrow. Take care of yourselves. Call your mother.
[20561.91s -> 20574.02s]  Bring some water. Eat a couple of broccoli. You know what to do. We need the music. That's right.
[20574.02s -> 20588.33s]  You do. Let me get out of here first. There we go. Save and quit. Okay. And play us out.
[20588.33s -> 20600.42s]  Is the entire stream going to be that one game? Probably not. Vinny and I will play Wild Hearts
[20600.42s -> 20606.98s]  for a while. I don't know. If we, if I'm having a great time, I probably just won't stop. What if
[20606.98s -> 20620.66s]  I want to pivot at some point after I'm done with the sponsor? We'll see. Take care. Good night.
[20621.30s -> 20627.46s]  Get some sleep. What about Sorcery and Frog Detective? Well, I did promise Frog Detective
[20627.46s -> 20632.58s]  would happen before the end of February or I was going to, I don't know. I was, I don't know. I
[20632.58s -> 20645.98s]  was going to do something weird. So that will happen. Write the yoga stream down. I will.
[20646.54s -> 20665.53s]  I'm looking forward to finishing this game. What about Sorcery? I know. I got to find a spot for
[20665.53s -> 20678.12s]  it. There's a lot of games that I've just kept on the back burner for a long time. The goal is to
[20678.12s -> 20685.37s]  play through most of them. You ever practice your voices? Yes, I do. Um, on twitch.tv slash German
[20685.37s -> 20698.87s]  nine, eight, five, a couple of times a week. Pretty much what you hear. What about Breath of
[20698.87s -> 20704.33s]  the Wild? I'll, I will make sure to finish Breath of the Wild before the new one comes out.
[20705.05s -> 20717.10s]  There's your other promise or I will, I will. All right. Good night. Shameless plug. Yeah,
[20717.10s -> 20723.93s]  sorry. I'm shouting out a twitch channel here. Is there anywhere to suggest older games? There
