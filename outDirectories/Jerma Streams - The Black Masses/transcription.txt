[2900.57s -> 2905.40s]  sonin pass from the village of grimsby so are there more survivors out there
[2906.20s -> 2910.12s]  yes we were out scavenging when we ran into a horde in the pass and ended up on the side
[2910.76s -> 2916.76s]  when you head back i'll come with you that sounds like a good idea but we barricaded the way through
[2916.76s -> 2925.07s]  sonin pass to stop the horde is there any other way to grimsby yes but the only other way would
[2925.07s -> 2929.63s]  be through the mine and far too dangerous okay i'll deal with the possessed at the bottom of
[2929.63s -> 2934.67s]  the tower first thank you we'll make our way to the chapel when it's safe it's safe travels
[2937.42s -> 2944.22s]  it's great to see a fellow survivor they chased us down the road we barely made it stay safe

[3109.28s -> 3114.36s]  survivors in grimsby but they did mention that the past is now barricaded and the only way to
[3114.36s -> 3118.89s]  grimsby now is through the mines i see the lord had locked the mines just off the process from
[3118.89s -> 3125.16s]  coming out what do you suggest i believe he fled with everyone else but i'm sure a key to the mine
[3125.16s -> 3131.85s]  would be at his home mesra castle southeast from town on the coastal rock isle i'm sure you'll find
[3131.85s -> 3142.17s]  many useful items he left behind okay i will go to the castle many many have died make your choice

[11117.37s -> 11122.17s]  be a source of power i need to get into that tower either you're insane or you're up to
[11122.17s -> 11126.33s]  something questionable neither i believe there is something useful we could put an end to all of
[11126.33s -> 11132.57s]  this i hope you're right but between you and me but between you and the tower a ten thousand
[11132.57s -> 11139.77s]  possessed huh how many soldiers are here a couple thousand but you'll need to talk to the general

[11146.17s -> 11166.28s]  the general and maybe i could save some time for a great low rate you can save online go to the
[11166.28s -> 11184.94s]  general save some time generally even actually a good insurance company i mean are they they're

[11343.45s -> 11352.48s]  your trust worth first what must i do well behind me there are maybe six to seven hundred of them

[12674.00s -> 12695.24s]  position what's that light are you exhausted from pretending no no yet i still got at least like

[12712.67s -> 12722.16s]  that i gotta get right there how do i do that it looks like kind of good but i guess not
[12730.88s -> 12735.60s]  go in the front door i can't there's like 5000 people in the front door i have to go all the
[12735.60s -> 12767.87s]  way around don't i all the way around back uh don't kill me whopper watch that sounds
[12767.87s -> 12775.74s]  kind of good right now actually i would take a whopper right now i don't even like burger king
[12776.38s -> 12783.60s]  i would say burger king is my least favorite out of the three but you bring a whopper in here right
[12783.60s -> 12792.43s]  now you present one to me i would eat it on stream and after every bite i'd go oh my god oh my god

[13559.63s -> 13575.72s]  rest of the stream yeah i don't want to eat like burger king right now not right now i thought
[13575.72s -> 13580.44s]  about it i was really thinking about but like no i was just walked right off the edge okay that was
[13580.76s -> 13594.28s]  stupid all right i got the um i got the item let's just teleport 500 million per mick chicken
[13594.28s -> 13602.14s]  eaten tonight i don't think you want to do that deal man i can eat dozens of chicken nuggets
[13604.19s -> 13610.72s]  if i really was hungry and i really sat down i'm not kidding i could probably eat 50 in one sitting
[13610.72s -> 13614.96s]  over the course of about maybe like an hour i could probably eat 50 mick chickens no
[13615.28s -> 13629.61s]  i mean nuggets it's a lot that's too much all right so now it's time i have the the
[13629.61s -> 13635.02s]  relic of the item why are you still playing this i don't know because i want to see the huge battle
[13635.02s -> 13644.41s]  that happens in about 10 minutes no i could i could definitely without a problem 20 to 30 chicken
[13644.41s -> 13652.27s]  nuggets and i would be able to stand up and stretch my back and go oh i feel okay and i would lie down
[13652.27s -> 13657.55s]  for a little while i'd be able to do it after about 30 i'd have to clock out i would
[13658.19s -> 13666.94s]  it'd be like 35 40 hey i can listen i can definitely eat as many chicken nuggets as years
[13666.94s -> 13683.32s]  i've been alive guaranteed that's easy yeah for some of you for some of you 15 year old some of
[13683.32s -> 13693.16s]  you yeah what are you 16 20 18 30 i'm 35 that's a lot of nuggets some of you guys are like in

[16036.01s -> 16056.96s]  Like on the right way. Okay, we I think get out of this menu get out of the menu. You just run into something

[16093.75s -> 16117.54s]  This is not supposed to happen yet. I don't I think it wasn't
[16118.26s -> 16120.79s]  He's level 20
[16120.79s -> 16128.57s]  Look if I have to walk him into the ocean and get killed by the boogeyman guy, that's what I'm gonna do
[16129.41s -> 16131.21s]  Zombies are all dead
[16131.21s -> 16140.62s]  Are they? All right. Keep going. We'll get him
[16141.26s -> 16143.86s]  There's zombies near the tower. Yep. Okay. Oh
[16144.38s -> 16148.92s]  There's some up there too, but I think there's more over this way
[16149.40s -> 16155.04s]  Take him to the windmill
[16156.72s -> 16161.00s]  Remember where the windmill is the guys I don't remember where the windmill is
[16164.36s -> 16167.04s]  Where's the windmill get out before he gets me?
[16167.56s -> 16174.21s]  Where's the windmill? I forget where the windmill is
[16174.69s -> 16195.08s]  It's like all the way down here, isn't it? I forget I'll find it. Let's see if I can get him there
[16195.64s -> 16197.52s]  Let's have to go this direction
[16197.52s -> 16214.97s]  Come on
[16214.97s -> 16216.49s]  worst joke
[16216.49s -> 16223.05s]  That's this is not a joke. This is just a destiny. This has to happen. This is not a joke. This is this dude's destiny
[16233.39s -> 16239.81s]  Windmill it's coming up here somewhere, isn't it? It's down. It's down here
[16240.41s -> 16259.23s]  Hey, no deal. I'm not making a deal. I just want to do this to this guy
[16259.71s -> 16281.59s]  Hey a little bit more down this way lead him off a cliff
[16281.59s -> 16291.71s]  I guess I could I could just but I don't think he'll come up the mountain that the windmill is that it right there
[16292.05s -> 16316.04s]  This is actually the final boss. This is it up here, isn't it? No, holy shit. This is so far
[16316.04s -> 16339.19s]  What all right? Well, there's people here. Never mind. Well, they attack him. They do attack him. We get a cheap shot in the head
[16353.94s -> 16359.00s]  Where'd he go?
[16380.63s -> 16390.33s]  It's just oh I can't even anymore man, this is so stupid I'm just gonna lead him into the water fucking I don't care
[16397.74s -> 16404.54s]  No, I can't do it again stop. Oh my god
[16415.19s -> 16421.00s]  Is he still out here I think he might be still out here
[16423.23s -> 16436.79s]  What the fuck he's dead who killed him what
[16444.28s -> 16449.52s]  Which you guys don't understand as I hit this guy in the head like ten times with a hammer
[16450.50s -> 16455.52s]  Eventually the adrenaline is gonna wear off and you're gonna fall down. You're gonna go to one knee and you're gonna die man
[16455.52s -> 16461.34s]  I hit him right in the back of the head like six times. Oh
[16471.89s -> 16473.89s]  That was so dumb. Whatever
[16474.41s -> 16477.97s]  Hey, I hope all hey the general tried to kill me by the way
[16478.49s -> 16484.05s]  Yes after the invasion of the tower I obtained a body part of a god the general tried to kill me and attempt to take
[16484.05s -> 16487.85s]  It for himself. I'm sorry to hear this but somehow I'm not surprised
[16488.37s -> 16494.37s]  The general's behavior recently changed after he started studying the relic. I'm not sure what he's planning to do with it. I
[16495.09s -> 16497.09s]  See something I should tell you
[16497.25s -> 16500.39s]  I've been having visions. I wasn't sure if they were real until now
[16501.15s -> 16506.67s]  Visions of what ever since I was marooned here a mysterious voice figure has been appearing and talking to me
[16507.23s -> 16510.58s]  What do you think the white figure is? I think he might be some sort of God
[16511.02s -> 16515.58s]  He gave me the mark on my hand. Well that confirms the visions are true. Okay
[16516.42s -> 16523.04s]  Like I'm not I wasn't just smoking in the bathroom. You just believe me. What is the relevance of these body parts?
[16523.52s -> 16526.76s]  He said that he could only take physical form once all the body parts
[16527.76s -> 16536.33s]  It sounds like we may have yet a chance I strongly advise you continue on this journey
[16536.33s -> 16541.06s]  Do you know of any other towers? There are three possibly four. I don't know
[16541.90s -> 16543.90s]  Sorry, I'm not much of a navigator
[16544.62s -> 16545.90s]  Okay
[16545.90s -> 16550.67s]  Good luck. I will spread the word about what you are doing as well as the general's betrayal. Thank you
[16550.67s -> 16552.67s]  Hope you caught a cross past again
[16553.15s -> 16564.04s]  More and more towers. I can tell you right now. I hate doing the other four towers
[16564.60s -> 16573.56s]  the McRib tower
[16573.60s -> 16576.28s]  But I just want to look at it. I just want to see it
[16578.65s -> 16584.98s]  You didn't even do this tower
[16585.26s -> 16591.15s]  That's true. I know I just want to look at this tower gets in the snow area. It's right here
[16591.67s -> 16593.43s]  All right, I'm gonna see
[16593.43s -> 16616.30s]  Climb the bar. No, I'm not climbing anymore. I'm not climbing the tower anymore. All right, we need to go this way
[16617.06s -> 16619.66s]  Towers that way. That's the direction. I'm going. Let's go
[16620.22s -> 16628.93s]  is the windmill to
[16628.93s -> 16636.86s]  Game it. I don't even know what killed that guy either. Wait, is there a better way to go?
[16639.51s -> 16644.03s]  Mmm, I gotta get up here. Uh, yeah, just go around. I'm not gonna fuck around and die
[16644.67s -> 16649.01s]  It'd be stupid
[16651.77s -> 16657.64s]  My whole body hurts right now my the face hurts my like eyes are hurt. Oh
