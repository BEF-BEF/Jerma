[3.45s -> 14.00s]  What is going on guys, Jerma here again with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[14.00s -> 18.00s]  This time I'm continuing the One Life series that I started a while back.
[18.00s -> 20.00s]  Like you know you've seen it before.
[20.00s -> 24.24s]  Gonna be playing as the scout on the first one and a spy on the second one.
[24.24s -> 27.24s]  Two One Life gameplays and somebody asked me, they said,
[27.24s -> 32.48s]  Jerma, if you call it One Life, you probably should only do one class in One Life.
[32.48s -> 34.48s]  A real One Life gameplay.
[34.48s -> 40.48s]  And while that may be true, I don't really like to upload very much content that's less than 3 or 4 minutes.
[40.48s -> 45.48s]  I mean my vlogs and my video logs and stuff like that, those can be under 2 minutes.
[45.48s -> 51.48s]  But a gameplay, a real gameplay like this, I want it to be at least 5 or 6 minutes.
[51.48s -> 55.48s]  I hate uploading 2 minute gameplays unless it's a short or I'm announcing something.
[55.48s -> 57.48s]  But I don't have an announcement for you right now.
[57.48s -> 59.48s]  I just want to talk about the gameplay, talk about some strategies.
[59.48s -> 61.48s]  So let's get right to it.
[61.48s -> 65.30s]  King of the Hill Harvest is the map we're playing on and I gotta tell you something guys.
[65.30s -> 69.47s]  This setup, this shortstop, Mad Milk, and the Candy Cane setup,
[69.47s -> 73.71s]  Oh my god, it's my new favorite scout setup by far.
[73.71s -> 75.71s]  I love this setup.
[75.71s -> 78.08s]  This was the first time I really played with this setup.
[78.08s -> 84.08s]  Sure I've played Mad Milk, Shortstop before, but I've never done Mad Milk, Shortstop, and the Candy Cane.
[84.08s -> 88.08s]  Because the Candy Cane, if you don't know, when you take damage from explosive damage,
[88.08s -> 94.08s]  Well that's kind of redundant, but if you take explosive damage, it hurts you for 25% more.
[94.08s -> 99.08s]  So it's kind of scary. You could potentially get one shot by a rocket or one shot by a grenade.
[99.08s -> 102.08s]  It's very possible when you have the Candy Cane equipped.
[102.08s -> 107.08s]  But the really cool part about the Candy Cane is when you kill somebody, anyone with any of your weapons,
[107.08s -> 109.08s]  you get to pick up a little small health pack.
[109.08s -> 111.08s]  It just drops right onto the ground.
[111.08s -> 114.08s]  But you gotta remember, you're not the only person going after it.
[114.08s -> 117.08s]  Your teammates and your enemies can both pick it up.
[117.08s -> 122.08s]  Which can get kind of annoying, because you'll kill somebody, and one of your teammates will just be waltzing over it
[122.08s -> 125.08s]  and not even see it, and just grab it like,
[125.08s -> 127.08s]  D'uh, sorry, I...
[127.08s -> 131.58s]  And it can be really, really annoying sometimes, because you'll have 10 health,
[131.58s -> 136.75s]  and the person running over it will have 195 as a soldier, and it's just like,
[136.75s -> 138.75s]  Yeah, come on.
[138.75s -> 141.93s]  It's a really good setup though, I suggest you try it out.
[141.93s -> 143.93s]  If you've never tried it before, it's really fun.
[144.93s -> 147.93s]  And also, in this gameplay, I break my kills record.
[147.93s -> 151.93s]  Now, don't get all excited for that, because it's not a really big achievement.
[151.93s -> 153.93s]  Scout is my least...
[153.93s -> 157.42s]  I do the worst with the Scout, let's put it that way.
[157.42s -> 162.42s]  So, my kills record was 13 in one life before this, and now it's 15.
[162.42s -> 167.86s]  So, I guess that's okay, but I see people do a lot better.
[167.86s -> 172.86s]  So this Engineer looks like he was having lag issues, or he ran out of ammo with the Widowmaker.
[172.86s -> 176.86s]  Not really sure, but speaking of ammo, I ran out of mine,
[176.86s -> 179.86s]  so I'm running around with the Candy Cane, swinging around like a jerk,
[179.86s -> 181.86s]  and I got nowhere to go.
[181.86s -> 186.03s]  Come around here, I pick up the ammo, and now let me give you guys some Scout tips.
[186.03s -> 189.03s]  This is a very, very important tip for the Scout.
[189.03s -> 192.03s]  How to effectively double jump, and when to use it, and where to use it.
[192.03s -> 197.03s]  Watch right here, I kind of go this way, and then I double jump, juke over to the right,
[197.03s -> 198.03s]  and shoot the Heavy.
[198.03s -> 201.03s]  He was probably expecting me to be at ground level at that point,
[201.03s -> 203.03s]  so you really, really need to mess around with people,
[203.03s -> 206.03s]  and get them to think that you're going one direction,
[206.03s -> 208.03s]  and then jump a completely opposite direction.
[208.03s -> 210.03s]  It really, really throws people off.
[210.03s -> 214.03s]  You know why I know that? Because it really throws me off.
[214.03s -> 216.03s]  And that's the end of the Scout gameplay right there.
[216.03s -> 218.03s]  One life, 15 kills.
[218.03s -> 222.21s]  Try to practice your double jumping, because it can really screw people around.
[222.21s -> 225.21s]  That's where you get most of your kills, by deception.
[225.21s -> 228.38s]  Moving on now, this is the second one life gameplay.
[228.38s -> 230.38s]  It's the Spy on Gold Rush.
[230.38s -> 231.62s]  It's really interesting.
[231.62s -> 234.62s]  I don't really kill a whole lot of people in this one, guys,
[234.62s -> 236.62s]  but oh my god, do I destroy a lot of buildings.
[236.62s -> 241.62s]  I destroy three full level three sentry guns by myself,
[241.62s -> 244.86s]  and it's within about two and a half minutes.
[244.86s -> 246.86s]  So let's watch and see how this goes down.
[246.86s -> 250.86s]  First one, I believe, was a level two, actually, now that I watch it again.
[250.86s -> 254.86s]  So I get two level threes, and one level two, bang, Engineer goes down,
[254.86s -> 259.86s]  and I just single-handedly took out all their defenses in about 40 seconds.
[259.86s -> 261.86s]  So I thought that was a really, really interesting achievement.
[261.86s -> 264.86s]  I wonder why they don't have anything like that in the game right now.
[264.86s -> 268.10s]  I would really like to have seen a Spy achievement,
[268.10s -> 271.10s]  where if you destroy two or three buildings in a row,
[271.10s -> 274.10s]  or four or five buildings in a row within 30 seconds or something,
[274.10s -> 276.28s]  I think that would be actually pretty cool.
[276.28s -> 278.52s]  Forgot to tell you the loadout for the match.
[278.52s -> 284.52s]  The loadout for this gameplay is the Kunai vs. Kunai, or the Stinga, not E-R-A-H.
[284.52s -> 286.52s]  I renamed it the Stinga.
[286.52s -> 290.52s]  So it's the Stinga, the Ambassador, and the Dead Ringer.
[290.52s -> 293.70s]  I actually wanted to use the Diamond back in this gameplay,
[293.70s -> 296.70s]  but I didn't think there was going to be any Sentries,
[296.70s -> 299.70s]  because the gameplay before this, there wasn't very many Sentries,
[299.70s -> 301.70s]  and I don't even think there was an Engineer on the other team.
[301.70s -> 303.70s]  So look at what happens in this gameplay, though.
[303.70s -> 307.70s]  I destroy a ton of buildings, and there's like four Engineers.
[307.70s -> 310.70s]  So that would happen to me, obviously, right?
[310.70s -> 312.70s]  Refilling my cloak on that Dispenser.
[312.70s -> 314.70s]  A lot of Spies don't know that you can do that.
[314.70s -> 316.70s]  So guys, if you were unaware, if you didn't know,
[316.70s -> 320.70s]  if you stand next to a Dispenser as a Spy,
[320.70s -> 322.70s]  whether it's an enemy one or it's a friendly one,
[322.70s -> 324.70s]  you will refill your cloak.
[324.70s -> 326.94s]  So right here, I just say hello to this Engineer.
[326.94s -> 328.94s]  How's your family? How's your wife and kids?
[328.94s -> 332.94s]  Sentry goes down, and right here, I thought this was the end of the game for me.
[332.94s -> 335.94s]  I kind of crouched to sort of accept my fate,
[335.94s -> 337.94s]  but I ended up getting the shots on that Sniper,
[337.94s -> 339.94s]  and I ended up getting away.
[339.94s -> 342.18s]  So I was really happy about that.
[342.18s -> 345.67s]  So still being alive, I decide to pretend to be on the other team,
[345.67s -> 349.67s]  whip around, see the Medic, and completely miss the Side Stab.
[349.67s -> 352.67s]  I'm not even sure I was going for a Side Stab.
[352.67s -> 354.67s]  I think I was going for a Chaos Stab.
[354.67s -> 358.04s]  I think I'm going to coin that term right now.
[358.04s -> 362.28s]  A Chaos Stab is when absolute nonsense is going on,
[362.28s -> 364.28s]  and you're just swinging around violently,
[364.28s -> 367.28s]  and you happen to get a Back Stab on someone.
[367.28s -> 369.46s]  So that was me trying to go for a Chaos Stab,
[369.46s -> 371.46s]  just stabbing the guy in the face,
[371.46s -> 374.46s]  and hopefully maybe getting some lag compensation or something.
[374.46s -> 376.46s]  So now I just want to give you guys a quick little tip
[376.46s -> 379.46s]  on how to deal with a Dead Ringer spy.
[379.46s -> 383.46s]  As you saw right there, I just got air blasted across the map,
[383.46s -> 385.46s]  and that's something you really don't want to do.
[385.46s -> 388.46s]  You really don't want to air blast Dead Ringer spies,
[388.46s -> 390.46s]  because number one, it's going to make your teammates
[390.46s -> 393.46s]  a lot less accurate when trying to shoot them.
[393.46s -> 395.46s]  Because you know that when you take damage as a Dead Ringer,
[395.46s -> 399.46s]  it's 10% of the normal damage you would normally be taking,
[399.46s -> 403.46s]  so you really want people to be able to focus fire on the Dead Ringer spy.
[403.46s -> 405.46s]  Rather than launching them around all over the place,
[405.46s -> 408.46s]  you really want to be able to have focus on that one target.
[408.46s -> 411.46s]  So don't air blast a Dead Ringer spy.
[411.46s -> 413.46s]  Just try to do as much damage as you possibly can.
[413.46s -> 415.82s]  Coming up the left staircase here,
[415.82s -> 418.82s]  I was going to go for a Jumping Stab on this Heavy.
[418.82s -> 420.82s]  Decide to just go for the Sure Thing,
[420.82s -> 423.82s]  because I am really, really bad when it comes to Stair Stabs
[423.82s -> 426.82s]  and Trick Stabs and Jump Stabs.
[426.82s -> 427.82s]  So I just went for the Sure Thing,
[427.82s -> 429.82s]  got my Dead Ringer to activate.
[429.82s -> 431.82s]  Coming up the same staircase,
[431.82s -> 434.82s]  and I see that there is a Sniper now on the right side.
[434.82s -> 437.06s]  Kind of just wanted to shoot him in his face,
[437.06s -> 438.06s]  and that's what I end up doing.
[438.06s -> 440.06s]  One in the face, one in the body.
[440.06s -> 442.06s]  That is going to be the end of the gameplay, guys.
[442.06s -> 444.06s]  Thank you so much for watching.
[444.06s -> 446.06s]  I really do appreciate it.
[446.06s -> 447.06s]  Take care, everybody.
[447.06s -> 449.06s]  I'll see you all next time.
