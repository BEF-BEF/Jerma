[14.26s -> 24.28s]  Alright, I'm back. What's up? I got the music working again, aren't you happy?
[24.28s -> 37.51s]  Fucking better be. Alright, Street Fighter 6, let's go.
[37.51s -> 44.97s]  So I have to tell you, I need to make this very clear. I am not a fighting game player at all.
[44.97s -> 53.34s]  You've seen me play stuff like multiverses. But traditional fighting games, I don't play them.
[53.34s -> 61.91s]  I'm not really super into them. But Street Fighter 6 caught my eye for a few different reasons.
[61.91s -> 71.08s]  One of which is the single player mode. That is the reason why I bought this game,
[71.08s -> 78.55s]  is because of that. Does the title still make sense for this game? Don't adjust your TV set.
[78.55s -> 94.54s]  Yes, I'm actually playing. I guess that makes sense too, because why would I be playing this?
[94.54s -> 103.50s]  Alright, so I need to make a character and I apologize that it's probably going to take about
[103.50s -> 115.29s]  at least 30 minutes. I got no timer on this. The character creator is kind of ridiculous
[115.29s -> 130.28s]  from what I've seen. So let's go for it. You should see it right now. You should see it right
[130.28s -> 136.49s]  now. There we go. Alright, so what I want to do, I want to do this. This is World Tour.
[136.49s -> 139.85s]  Create an avatar and embark on a journey to discover the meaning of strength. Take the
[139.85s -> 154.98s]  plunge and experience the world of Street Fighter like never before. Let's go. You ready? Go.
[157.18s -> 175.43s]  I think I'll make Shikidian off of it. Make Miku? Well, let's get in there first.
[183.00s -> 185.16s]  I'll turn it up.
[194.09s -> 200.17s]  Honestly, Capcom doesn't miss lately. Capcom doesn't miss. I don't know what happened.
[202.09s -> 212.44s]  What happened? Capcom doesn't miss anymore. That's kind of surprising. I know, yeah,
[212.44s -> 223.34s]  I said fuck Capcom that time, but it didn't mean it. I was in a fit of rage. I did say that.
[223.74s -> 248.55s]  A couple years ago. Well, now it's love. Bless Capcom. Cool. You can remove screen shake in
[248.55s -> 264.49s]  this game. Already did it. Kids, take a breather. This is Buckler Security Services. I'm Luke,
[264.49s -> 275.03s]  the coach around you. New character, new character. Alright, here we go. What do I make?
[276.68s -> 281.08s]  A new you. Creating your avatar. Bring avatar for World Tour mode. It will also be used in the
[281.08s -> 290.97s]  Battle Hub. OK, I think I have to do this. The length of your limbs and size of your body matter
[291.53s -> 297.34s]  during battle. Having long limbs makes it easier. So I have to just have wicked long arms?
[297.34s -> 303.38s]  Make Golem? We have to live with this character for as long as I play this game.
[310.10s -> 327.03s]  We have to live with this. OK, presets. So where do we start? OK, wait, there's more.
[328.26s -> 345.86s]  Alright, I think I'm starting here. Oh, come on, don't. I think I have to start here. OK,
[347.10s -> 356.74s]  body preset. Moving the point of the triangle after making the settings for interview. OK,
[356.74s -> 376.04s]  so just telling me that it. OK, how big do I want to make this guy? I kind of like that.
[376.68s -> 387.91s]  That's a good start. We can change it after. Blend face. No, no, no. Light and proportions.
[390.47s -> 398.90s]  Well, that just doesn't look right. How tall is this? Sitting height where I could just
[398.90s -> 406.12s]  changing your height to the minimum or maximum. OK, so there's a certain value where it becomes
[406.12s -> 436.52s]  kind of screwed up. Oh no. OK, I'm going to hate this after 10 minutes. Let's have a long ass
[436.52s -> 457.86s]  torso. All right, I think it's fine. Upper body. No, I could do neck length. So he said crash
[457.86s -> 463.30s]  bandicoot. OK, we're making crash bandicoot. We're making crash bandicoot. That is exactly
[463.30s -> 473.14s]  who this is going to be. Wow, that's what a great fucking comment. This needs to be up way higher.
[473.14s -> 487.45s]  We've got to cover the head because we need to put crash bandicoot's face on his chest.
[487.45s -> 500.63s]  Oh, my God, you crash his voice. OK, um. Whoa, it's like that, right?
[509.70s -> 523.77s]  He's kind of like he looks like a flounder. No, no, no. I said big. Make the arms big.
[524.33s -> 534.42s]  How big a crash bandicoot's hands. They're actually kind of long. They go down this far.
[534.42s -> 545.53s]  These arms are way too thick, though. That's better. Shoulders are too thick. This is just a
[545.53s -> 551.93s]  Titan from Attack on Titan. Yeah, that's what everybody is making. OK, everybody is making an
[551.93s -> 557.61s]  Attack on Titan Titan. That's what every person you've seen play this game does. There are no
[557.61s -> 576.10s]  normal people made with this. No one. Not a single person is making normal people. Abdomen bulge.
[576.90s -> 589.51s]  OK, hold on. Sometimes when you stare at your face long enough, wonder if that beauty mark's
[589.51s -> 611.11s]  always been there. Forehead protrusion. Eyebrow spacing. OK, that looks fine. Brow depth. I like
[611.11s -> 644.44s]  the higher brows. Surprised or angry? Angry for sure. 100%. Yeah, this is all right so far. Along
[644.44s -> 669.10s]  to the jobby. That's a lot of neck. That's mostly neck. Oh my goodness. With a huge underbite. All
[669.10s -> 685.19s]  right. Jaw shape. This kind of has to fill into the neck a little bit. Maybe not. No, pull it back.
[685.19s -> 706.95s]  That's fine. OK, cool. Hair. I actually kind of like this one. OK, it might be this one too.
[707.51s -> 740.73s]  Oh my goodness. All right. Is it just a middle part? That's good too, though. Oh, that's really
[740.73s -> 770.87s]  good. That's good too. OK, wait, I need hair color. Am I fucking this up? Is it red? Does it have
[770.87s -> 786.68s]  wicked shiny hair? Wait, how many colors can I do? Why is it red? Why is it just getting redder?
[791.19s -> 804.98s]  Am I mixing the colors together? Hair color one. OK, there we go. All right, that's fine.
[812.06s -> 829.18s]  Oh, color mixing. There it is. All right, that's fine with me. Eye shape. All right, we have to put
[829.18s -> 859.14s]  the eyes down really low. OK, that looks fine. Eye size. Wait, what did I just do? No, no. How
[859.14s -> 885.34s]  do I? Oh, right here. OK, I like the big eyes. Intensity. Whoa. OK, that's cool. Do we just give
[885.34s -> 911.30s]  them undertaker eyes? OK, yep. I like it. When somebody with blue eyes looks at you.
[911.30s -> 947.18s]  You make them bright. Oh, no, too bright. OK, lashes. Just no eyelashes. I'm thinking no
[947.18s -> 974.84s]  eyelashes at all. No eyebrows either. And no eyebrows and no eyelashes. OK, here we go. This
[974.84s -> 984.79s]  is where we start to really make the face the face. I don't like this at all, but I guess we're
[984.79s -> 1002.18s]  living with it. Now I want to go and zoom into his face. This dude's hitboxes are going to be so
[1002.18s -> 1045.70s]  fucked. Oh, that's right. Oh, well, the nostrils are all the way down here. OK. OK, I think I'm
[1045.70s -> 1061.99s]  all right with this. All right. Mouth position. Probably all the way down. Right. I want the I
[1061.99s -> 1082.74s]  want the lower. Oh, that's all right. Mouth corners. No, happy for sure. That's terrifying.
[1082.74s -> 1120.12s]  OK, that's fine. I think that looks good. All right. Facial hair. That's all right. My goodness.
[1121.43s -> 1153.46s]  Wow. That's long. Wow. That one's great, too. Holy shit. OK, I Gandalf. We need new hair then.
[1153.46s -> 1163.08s]  If this is Gandalf or this is, you know, we need new hair and hair is Gandalf have.
[1163.08s -> 1190.10s]  I guess it's kind of like this. Why is it so like, oh, it's the there we go. OK, he's way too
[1190.10s -> 1213.69s]  fucked up. You know what I mean? A lower body. We can fix everything. All right. Hold on. Huge
[1213.69s -> 1232.92s]  waist. No, no, no, no. Huge pelvis. Oh, no. It looks like a refrigerator. All right. I'll keep it.
[1232.92s -> 1246.38s]  I'll keep it. I'll keep it. We need to make them as square as possible. Oh, yeah. 100 percent.
[1246.38s -> 1275.88s]  No, everything has to be the same. Oh, my God. What? Why? Oh, this is too. This is too much. OK.
[1275.88s -> 1304.10s]  What else we got? Muscle definition. Wait, metallic, metallic. I can just be shining.
[1304.10s -> 1315.72s]  That's going to be so annoying to look at. No, I'm sorry. I mean, that's pretty damn cool,
[1315.72s -> 1343.53s]  though. I mean, that's pretty cool. Maybe not so metallic. That looks good. Oh, hair quality one
[1343.53s -> 1363.48s]  or two. We're going to have some back hair. OK, I think. Oh, you are kind of. All right. Wait a
[1363.48s -> 1382.73s]  minute. Sitting height. This has to be, I think, as long as possible. OK, he's kind of a piece of
[1382.73s -> 1396.33s]  toast. He's like a piece of bread. OK, I'm happy with this so far. Body paint.
[1400.36s -> 1404.90s]  Oh, I can get. I don't need that. What do I have here?
[1414.54s -> 1440.15s]  OK. All right. Hold on. It's it's got to be. OK, how about this one? Is this one cool? I don't know.
[1441.69s -> 1472.25s]  Nice one piece character that you made through. Oops. What do I do? Oh, shit. I screwed it up.
[1472.25s -> 1490.42s]  Um, what am I? What is this? I don't know what setting. Oh, it's my lips. OK, this is a mold.
[1490.42s -> 1502.07s]  Then how do I get? I want to take that off. Shit. How do I get this off? There we go. OK.
[1505.00s -> 1516.31s]  OK. Body hair color. Yeah, we did this already. All right. Voice. Let me hear those vocal. See
[1516.31s -> 1521.27s]  what you've got. Put on a good show. Let's see what you've got. Let's see how you do.
[1523.51s -> 1532.41s]  See what you've got. Think you can take me. Here I go. This one's good. You got the skills.
[1538.41s -> 1542.41s]  Let's put on a good show. Let's see what you've got. Let's see what you've got.
[1543.85s -> 1550.44s]  Oh, that's a good one. That was somebody getting trapped in a combo.
[1550.68s -> 1563.94s]  Let's see what you've got. I like that one. Play the game. Relax. I am not to be trifled with.
[1565.64s -> 1581.54s]  This is half the game right here. I like it. OK, current recipe. Download recipe. No, I just
[1581.54s -> 1592.07s]  know I'm ready. I think we're good. I think we're good. Forget your name either.
[1593.51s -> 1603.66s]  Flatline Greg. It's going to be his name. Give me your Sunday best. OK.
[1603.66s -> 1629.54s]  OK, sounds good to me. What do I have to do? Take a look. Let's go. Oh, goodness.
[1636.10s -> 1641.14s]  Honestly, the people that make normal characters, you have a lot of mental fortitude.
[1645.90s -> 1651.90s]  The mental fortitude it takes to not make your characters nose four or five inches off of their
[1651.90s -> 1658.58s]  face is incredible. I can't believe that you're able to do that. All right. How do we play Street
[1658.58s -> 1681.69s]  Fighter? OK. All right. Yep. There are three movement speeds. It just doesn't fit at all in
[1681.69s -> 1696.58s]  this entire universe. I hate this character already. His head is too small. I'm going to
[1696.58s -> 1703.46s]  know. I'm not going to. I'm going to hate it. OK. Press A, B, X, Y while holding right bumper
[1703.46s -> 1707.53s]  allowing you to control the camera even while using a controller that has no right stick.
[1707.53s -> 1731.58s]  All right. Well, that's fine. Great. Operate the camera. Use right stick. Easy. It's for arcade
[1731.58s -> 1741.62s]  stick. OK. You look like a door. Show me how you are with your fists. All right. There are two
[1741.62s -> 1746.50s]  control schemes for battles in World Tour mode. Modern and classic. Cool. Modern is a four button
[1746.50s -> 1756.36s]  layout that allows players to enjoy a more freeform approach to combat. Modern is the only control
[1756.36s -> 1762.63s]  type available in World Tour during Chapter one. OK. So it's not. I looked into this a little bit.
[1766.22s -> 1772.78s]  Yeah. So it's light attack, medium attack, heavy attack, special move. I get it. Might as well.
[1778.06s -> 1787.67s]  Yep. Holding back is blocking, right? All right. I punched. I did it. Jump three times. I know how
[1787.67s -> 1812.47s]  to do that. Up. Nice. You should just do modern. I probably will just do modern. Crouch. Don't. The
[1812.47s -> 1819.77s]  beard physics are way too distracting. Yeah, but we have to live with it. It's fine. OK.
[1819.77s -> 1833.98s]  Light, medium, heavy. Yep. Tackle jumping multiple times. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Got it. OK.
[1833.98s -> 1840.84s]  Three special attacks. So these are special moves like a duken, but you don't have to do like
[1841.64s -> 1846.60s]  down, left, down, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, square, left, right, square. Right.
[1846.60s -> 1851.26s]  You actually just press one button. I actually like that a lot. So I'm sorry if I'm a casual
[1851.90s -> 1859.30s]  apologize in advance. OK. So it's just in a direction and that it's like somebody
[1859.30s -> 1874.52s]  said it's like Smash Brothers, huh? OK, cool. Oh, that's the point of modern. Go throw Luke
[1874.52s -> 1892.38s]  three times left trigger if you're using modern control scheme. Oh, modern's fine. Yeah, I'm not
[1892.38s -> 1898.54s]  worried about it. I'm not really a fighting game player, but that means I can have fun, too. Cool.
[1899.66s -> 1906.47s]  Can you play with a modern style online? That's how the basics are. Simple and do you have to
[1906.47s -> 1911.43s]  go against other modern players? Even the biggest rockets need a stable launching pad for takeoff
[1911.43s -> 1918.54s]  or else they're just going to crash and burn. You get me? Coach, how is any of that? No. Interesting.
[1921.10s -> 1930.70s]  You do less damage with it. Modern and classic can play each other. They're intended to be balanced
[1930.70s -> 1939.13s]  to both are viable. That's cool. All right. We might have to take the beard off. It's actually
[1939.13s -> 1949.35s]  is way too distracting. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Decrease every year. Yeah. Yeah.
[1949.35s -> 1985.14s]  Declare victory. Decrease. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's do it. I can't believe you got hit in the tutorial.
[1985.14s -> 1997.18s]  Modern does less damage. Really going to be the type to jump before you think. Coach, that was
[1997.18s -> 2002.68s]  the kind of situation I want to learn to deal with. You're not here to punch bags either, right?
[2007.16s -> 2017.50s]  This is fun. He signed up with the same regimen you are. When does he play golem? I already did.
[2019.61s -> 2029.86s]  I already gave it a rating too. It was a 5.3. Golem is a 5.3. No, actually it's like a 4.8.
[2043.83s -> 2051.61s]  That's generous. That's way too high.
[2058.36s -> 2064.04s]  You can cross that bridge when you get to it. You two are still my plucky little trainees.
[2064.04s -> 2069.56s]  Give it a one. Listen to what your coach says and put your hearts into your training. Game was 60
[2069.56s -> 2075.93s]  bucks. Oh, it was. Oh my God. I completely didn't take. I did not even take that into
[2075.93s -> 2090.71s]  consideration. I just death stared. You wanted something more. That was a you're dead at some
[2090.79s -> 2121.34s]  point in this story. I'm going to kill you. New content. Billionaire streamer does not care
[2121.34s -> 2131.83s]  about the price. No, I told you I did. That's why I was like, wait, that's true.
[2134.20s -> 2138.36s]  I cannot wait to play this. Those of you that don't know why I'm excited about a street fighter
[2138.36s -> 2143.88s]  game when it's like, when does he ever cared about this? It's this game mode and just wait,
[2144.20s -> 2153.64s]  that ass is huge. It was distracting. Holy shit. Okay. What was I? I don't remember what I was
[2153.64s -> 2189.30s]  saying. It's open world and you can just kind of fight anybody. It seems really cool. Your
[2189.30s -> 2202.86s]  character fits right in. I don't know about that. Oh God. Those feet looked like cactuses.
[2202.86s -> 2216.94s]  They look like cactus. What was going on there? Actual hands-on experience on the streets.
[2217.34s -> 2225.03s]  Beating up the bad guys around here should do the trick. Sorry. Did the joke fly over your head?
[2225.59s -> 2230.92s]  At any rate, I was told this would point us toward our next steps. Oh, hang on a minute. I'm getting
[2230.92s -> 2238.49s]  a message from coach. There's an app on your device. Check it out. You get anything? You view
[2238.49s -> 2246.95s]  all sorts of information by pressing. Cool. Okay. You can view messages sent to your device by
[2246.95s -> 2253.72s]  selecting messages. Luke, let's get you started with some missions. Sending you training exercises
[2253.72s -> 2265.83s]  to the missions app. Check it out and follow any instructions that pop up there. Missions. New kid
[2265.83s -> 2270.55s]  on the block. Welcome to the streets where you go and what you do is entirely up to you. But if you
[2270.55s -> 2274.07s]  like to get a feel for how things are and usually done somewhere, there's no quick way than asking
[2274.07s -> 2284.52s]  the locals. Look for a person named Alice. She'll show you the ropes. Let's go. Basically, it's a
[2284.52s -> 2292.90s]  to-do list. The first thing we need to do is talk to that person right over there. That should be
[2292.90s -> 2304.82s]  easy. Let's get going. Your mission destination is denoted by a red mark. Try making your way to the
[2304.82s -> 2314.70s]  destination using the mark as your guide. Yep. This person's level nine. What level am I?
[2320.01s -> 2324.98s]  What do you think of my performance? Exciting, right? When you're performing, what matters most
[2324.98s -> 2330.66s]  is technique, tempo, and a mindset that practically commands onlookers to behold.
[2331.80s -> 2335.96s]  It's Lucifer. With that in mind, I'm going to teach you a pose to harness that very same mental
[2335.96s -> 2348.57s]  fortitude. Emote acquisition item. Check me out. Okay. Now that's a mindset you can set your watch
[2348.57s -> 2361.03s]  to. It all hinges on how you're feeling, friend. All right, let's do this. Alice. And you two must be
[2361.03s -> 2367.46s]  a couple of rookies who just want to get stronger. I take it. Right on the money. How did you know
[2367.46s -> 2374.71s]  it was us? Seriously, come on. It's practically written on your faces. That would have been four
[2374.71s -> 2384.14s]  dollars in gold. He asked me to assist with your training for a bit. Your little mission to come
[2384.14s -> 2388.94s]  talk to me was a smashing success. Next up, how about we have ourselves a fight? Okay. Don't hold
[2388.94s -> 2399.18s]  anything back now. I'm a lot stronger than you two. Okay. Plan 10 hits. When playing using the modern
[2399.18s -> 2403.90s]  control scheme, assisted combos can be before it by keeping right trigger pressed while attacking.
[2404.98s -> 2409.30s]  And then attack with right trigger X or right trigger A. And you can follow up with a combo
[2409.30s -> 2438.10s]  by simply repeating the button press. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, I see. So you hold right trigger.
[2438.58s -> 2445.83s]  It's Luigi mode. That's fine. You're getting one of the first to get to level 100 in Diablo 4.
[2447.46s -> 2452.50s]  I played a little bit of Diablo 4. I have a few thoughts on it. Can't give you my total opinion
[2452.50s -> 2461.59s]  of the game so far, but what I can tell you is this. So I find it funny. And I don't know why.
[2461.59s -> 2467.99s]  A lot of games have been doing this, I think, nowadays. But maybe minor spoilers for Diablo
[2467.99s -> 2471.91s]  4. If you don't want to hear it, just mute and come back in 30 seconds. But they'll tell you
[2471.91s -> 2481.96s]  something. Okay. Ready? Here comes spoilers for it. Three, two, one. Oh, you just missed her.
[2481.96s -> 2486.76s]  Oh, Lilith was just passed through this town and she would fucked a bunch of stuff up.
[2487.40s -> 2493.40s]  Oh, you missed her. And you go to the next town. Oh, you just missed it. She was here and she ate
[2493.40s -> 2498.84s]  somebody and then she killed three people. At the next town, I feel like she might be going there
[2499.56s -> 2507.00s]  and you walk to that town. Oh, you just missed Lilith. She was here. She stole one of our swines.
[2507.00s -> 2514.44s]  She stole one of our pigs. And then it's like we've been, I don't know, we're kind of just
[2515.56s -> 2523.83s]  walking and chasing Lilith. And at some point, there's even a sequence where, and spoilers,
[2523.83s -> 2529.94s]  we're still talking spoilers. You end up going to this place and it's like, oh, I know where she
[2529.94s -> 2534.98s]  went. She went this way. Oh, we have to chase her. She went to the next spot. Oh, she's passed
[2534.98s -> 2540.58s]  through here. You end up coming back to that town and it's leveled like shit. She actually fucking
[2540.58s -> 2555.05s]  came back. Why is he spoiling? I just told you we're talking Diablo four spoilers. That's the
[2555.05s -> 2560.81s]  entire Diablo two storyline. I think the reason why I don't mind it in the Diablo two storyline
[2560.81s -> 2567.45s]  is because you only get to hear that like three times total, not every new town you go to.
[2568.01s -> 2573.46s]  Do you know what I mean? There are a lot of towns in Diablo four and it's almost like, oh,
[2574.34s -> 2582.81s]  yeah, this is town number 15. Where'd she go? Find her. Follow the trail. Quick adventurer,
[2582.81s -> 2590.81s]  defend me while I open this door. I can read the runes. Oh, quick adventurer. Here they come.
[2591.37s -> 2608.97s]  I feel like that's happened quite a few times. But, but, but it's pretty fun. Yeah, it's fun.
[2609.61s -> 2617.86s]  But it's fun. I'm having fun with it. Street fighter. I thought you said street fighter four.
[2618.42s -> 2623.14s]  Whatever fucking game this is. Street fighter six. Somebody I I'm fucked up. I can't read what you
[2623.14s -> 2631.50s]  said. I have one other complaint about Diablo four and I'm going to give it to you right now.
[2633.42s -> 2639.50s]  All right, here we go. Yeah, call me stupid. Call me. Well, he needs like something explained to
[2639.50s -> 2648.38s]  him. There's a lot of if they're fours in Diablo four. There's a lot of like if this than that,
[2648.62s -> 2657.93s]  then this like lucky hit chance. If if somebody standing in your poison and then you do chilled
[2657.93s -> 2663.69s]  to them, then if there's lucky hit percentage going off, then 10% critical strike chance
[2665.21s -> 2671.77s]  will go up. It's like I like too many. What the fuck even does over what does overpower even do?
[2671.77s -> 2677.05s]  What does it even do? Well, you see, it's 3% chance to have your health and your fortification
[2677.05s -> 2686.79s]  combined data be used as a damage move. It's kind of confusing. Your brain is cooked eggs.
[2686.79s -> 2691.51s]  I'm sorry, but I don't want to look. I just want to hurt. I want to punch things.
[2692.15s -> 2710.06s]  You need modern Diablo controls. I gave you my Diablo take. So you're saying stir was right.
[2710.78s -> 2724.33s]  I don't actually don't know stirs Diablo for take. I wonder what it is now. Nice microwave egghead.
[2727.54s -> 2733.22s]  OK, when you when you get a legendary that drops and you look at it and you you need to read.
[2733.22s -> 2740.54s]  I didn't even know what lucky hit did until I was like fucking level 25. I wonder what and even
[2740.54s -> 2744.30s]  still I read up on it. I'm like, what the fuck is that? What does that even mean? What's happening?
[2744.30s -> 2758.44s]  All right, fight and beat two people. Here we go. He does need modern controls.
[2762.04s -> 2766.12s]  Oh, here he goes. Here he goes. He's here. He goes. Let's fight Hugo.
[2766.12s -> 2782.17s]  Hugo, you can use items during battle. OK, I don't need items to fight a level one.
[2782.89s -> 2796.23s]  I love this guy was just probably on his way to work. Stop jumping. Yeah.
[2808.78s -> 2812.66s]  That would be so weird. Try fight the level nine.
[2813.30s -> 2817.42s]  All right. Is the level nine going to kick the shit out of me? I'm going for it.
[2821.35s -> 2843.43s]  I'm barely hurting this guy, but every straight fighter thing I've ever seen is just keep the
[2843.43s -> 2863.43s]  person over here. Just keep them over on this corner. It's not fighting back.
[2864.63s -> 2877.50s]  Why is he not fighting? He's not fighting. Why is he not attacking me? Is this a stream sniper? No,
[2877.50s -> 2891.06s]  it. Oh, no, it's not a stream sniper. Don't you have to like juggle people to in these games?
[2905.22s -> 2911.48s]  All right. Well, there it is. Are there damage numbers?
[2911.48s -> 2919.66s]  Sturer said the campaign is the worst he's ever played in any a RPG, but the gameplay loop is
[2919.66s -> 2930.10s]  pretty fun if shallow. Really? Oh, you level up, right? Right, right, right, right. OK,
[2930.66s -> 2936.20s]  you gain skill points upon leveling up if you access the status app in your device and choose
[2936.20s -> 2956.95s]  skills. Oh, he said stirs stir of liked anthem. So, oh, what do I do? Where's my where's my phone
[2960.20s -> 2973.40s]  settings? Emotes and shortcuts, standard emotes. Oh, I got check me out. OK, cool.
[2978.06s -> 2983.67s]  Where did I level up? Customize your device can be personalized by changing your wallpaper.
[2984.23s -> 2993.99s]  Let's do blue. Looks good. Items status. Maybe check your styles and equipment gear.
[2993.99s -> 3001.86s]  I don't think I have any gear. Luke's style is the only one I have. OK, I don't.
[3001.86s -> 3009.45s]  Ah, this is where you change moves. All right. Well, I only have two.
[3009.45s -> 3018.14s]  Here we go. Skills. You level up. Cool. Carries over. You would like to redo how you've unlocked.
[3018.14s -> 3023.45s]  OK. All right. So we got increases the row strength. Yep. I'm just going to be a throw Andy.
[3023.45s -> 3038.38s]  I'm going to be unfucking bearable. Punch. Not like wasting points, am I? Cool. All right. Who
[3038.38s -> 3046.68s]  holds their phone like that? I did what you asked. Gotten a feel for fighting yet? Nothing beats
[3046.68s -> 3051.53s]  trying it for yourself. When you're out and about, not everyone you run into will go easy on you.
[3051.53s -> 3055.59s]  So if you're going to start a fight with somebody, pick your opponent wisely. Anyway,
[3055.59s -> 3067.42s]  I'll catch you two again sometime. OK, sometimes you got to talk to folks on the street and ask
[3067.42s -> 3071.90s]  them for a fight. Think of it like saying hi on the streets. Only lots more punching.
[3071.90s -> 3075.26s]  And if all that punching works up an appetite, go ahead and get yourself a bite.
[3075.26s -> 3081.82s]  There's a food truck nearby. You'd never guess from the look of it, but they do a killer pizza.
[3081.82s -> 3087.96s]  Pizza. Eating food is part of our training, too. Is coach just messing with us?
[3087.96s -> 3110.78s]  Let's do what he says. OK. Let's go, motherfucker. I want a free pizza.
[3131.98s -> 3137.86s]  Pepino. Watch out. That's funny. Yeah, he's not fighting either.
[3146.57s -> 3162.30s]  Look like the Beast Titan. He does look like the Beast Titan. Nice. All right. I just beat the shit
[3162.30s -> 3171.06s]  out of the pizza restaurant guy. Is that a bad thing? There's an X now. Is that bad?
[3175.29s -> 3183.67s]  All right, now we're just going to eat. OK, there are two types of food used immediately
[3183.67s -> 3188.55s]  and food used during battle. Food lineup changes from time to time. So check your map
[3188.55s -> 3196.26s]  screen to see what's on the menu. What the hell am I looking at? It's always pizza.
[3196.98s -> 3205.24s]  Pizza covered in asparagus and. Oh, no, no, no, no asparagus on pizza.
[3205.80s -> 3223.56s]  No, we get pepperoni. I ate it. This is not the kind of food that athletes like this eat
[3223.56s -> 3234.09s]  every day. It says clearly like cheating or something. How do you compete with cheese?
[3234.09s -> 3245.67s]  This hot and gooey as they do. What I tell you, bomb pizza, huh?
[3245.67s -> 3248.95s]  All pizza is good pizza, but the pepperoni gets my vote any day.
[3249.11s -> 3251.75s]  Ever run low on stamina, eating something will get you right back on your feet.
[3252.39s -> 3256.63s]  Some food will have you hitting harder, moving faster, the works. Food can power you up in all
[3256.63s -> 3261.10s]  kinds of ways. So don't be shy about expanding your palate. Now that you're done filling up,
[3261.10s -> 3265.50s]  why don't you pay a visit to that nearby alley? I could be an actor. I could be an actor. I could
[3265.50s -> 3304.50s]  be an actor. OK, go to that alley. OK, by the way, that pizza was fucking gross. One move, Andy.
[3313.45s -> 3320.42s]  Whoa, what's going on? Why is he? I'm disintegrating him. He's being fucking
[3320.42s -> 3345.94s]  pulled out of the universe. What's wrong with them? Level up. What are you looking at? Oh,
[3345.94s -> 3383.80s]  shit. Who's next? You're beating up a granny. What the hell are you doing? Piece of shit.
[3384.68s -> 3403.88s]  I'm smurfing. What does it look like? Oh, I can put points in. I have six points.
[3404.44s -> 3419.75s]  I'll do Max Vitality. Oh, it's all right. What was the other one? Defense. It's kind of the same
[3419.75s -> 3427.11s]  thing, just different ways, right? This is more complicated than Diablo for his skill tree.
[3432.74s -> 3455.45s]  Oh, oh, I'm in a fucking weird mood today. I'm sorry. I haven't streamed in like two weeks.
[3455.45s -> 3460.65s]  I need to wait to give my full opinion on D4. Look, I'm one of those people and I'm sorry about
[3460.65s -> 3470.22s]  this. I apologize. No, this is how I feel. Fuck it. Diablo 2 came out and nothing can ever compare
[3470.22s -> 3476.62s]  and look, oh, you're old and oh, yeah, everything can't be as good. Rose colored glasses. Shut the
[3476.62s -> 3482.22s]  fuck up. Right. I get it. But honestly, I don't think they can even come close ever again. I
[3482.22s -> 3486.46s]  don't think anybody could come close ever again. Nobody could ever come close ever again. It's
[3486.46s -> 3500.26s]  just unfortunate. It's the way it is. I'm playing Diablo 4 right now and having fun.
[3500.90s -> 3509.91s]  I'm like I'm having fun, too. I didn't say I didn't like it. I didn't say it wasn't good.
[3511.82s -> 3515.42s]  That's backtracking. No, I just told you that I need to like I need to play it more to get like
[3515.42s -> 3521.08s]  a real opinion. It's like a fucking 700 hour campaign or however long it is. That map is huge.
[3521.64s -> 3526.54s]  Wait, when getting into battles in the city, you find yourself against multiple opponents at once.
[3527.34s -> 3545.59s]  Okay, well, it's like 2v2. All right, this is interesting. Well, that guy was these guys were
[3545.59s -> 3568.20s]  weak. A giant Capcom symbol. Hello, you two. We meet again. Let me introduce you to my brothers,
[3568.20s -> 3574.49s]  Tracy and Ryan. Luke asked us to give you a hand with your training. You know, get the whole family
[3574.49s -> 3581.37s]  on board kind of deal. Hold on. Someone's someone's calling me out here. I got to read it. You don't
[3581.45s -> 3586.01s]  like Diablo 2 because it's better than the new games. You like it because you did it when you
[3586.01s -> 3590.97s]  were a teenager after school instead of getting yelled at for doing it wrong by like 10,000 people.
[3590.97s -> 3594.17s]  You can never go back to the mind you had the first time you played it.
[3596.86s -> 3608.76s]  That's like, that's a good point. You know what I mean? That's true. The skill points that needs
[3608.76s -> 3612.36s]  to I don't know, there should be more of them. I don't like the five skill points that add like
[3612.36s -> 3620.71s]  2% damage. I just gave me more of that. I can't give you an opinion until I beat it. I need to
[3620.71s -> 3627.06s]  give you a real opinion. Diablo 2 is probably number one ever of all time ever for me. I love
[3627.06s -> 3631.70s]  that franchise. I love it. Give me some time to give you a real opinion on it. Because I don't
[3631.70s -> 3637.08s]  know it could be much more in depth than I'm giving it credit for. He wants 10 skill points
[3637.08s -> 3649.43s]  with 1% damage. It's not what I said. We're imitating the thugs around here. They hide
[3649.43s -> 3653.51s]  their faces just like this. They're attacking folks left and right. So be careful out there.
[3654.15s -> 3666.42s]  They're random battles. That's funny. Okay, I can't give you an opinion gives an opinion. Well,
[3666.42s -> 3676.66s]  that's my in in process opinion. Right? That's my like review in whatever they call it.
[3676.66s -> 3684.38s]  Review in progress. There you get attacked on site. Their names are colored red. That's okay.
[3685.26s -> 3695.58s]  And the street will bring the fight to you. Bust out the self defense. Trust me, there are some
[3695.58s -> 3701.64s]  places you do not want to wander around unless you have got the chops. Okay. See the sign for
[3701.64s -> 3715.66s]  the apparel store. I want you to do something. Do some shopping there. Okay. New clothes. He's a
[3715.66s -> 3730.20s]  fast texter. It's all about the fight. Okay. Buy clothing. Do I have enough money to buy clothing?
[3737.30s -> 3744.55s]  Cool. All right. I want a pair of jeans. This is the only thing that's available.
[3745.19s -> 3766.65s]  This is the only thing I can buy is this hat. Okay. Well, all right. We both have the same hat.
[3767.29s -> 3787.86s]  Are you going to kill five boars already? Cringe incoming. What do you mean cringe incoming?
[3789.64s -> 3803.14s]  Talking about me? Cringe, cringe, cringe. What's going on? Chop till you drop.
[3803.14s -> 3806.58s]  Doesn't even matter if you're the fashionable type, to be honest.
[3806.58s -> 3810.31s]  A little bit of attention to your outfit can make all the difference in a fight.
[3810.31s -> 3814.66s]  And hey, doesn't it feel good when you find out that outfit just speaks to you?
[3814.66s -> 3819.62s]  Cool. Let's wrap things up for the day. I'm wandering around the city as we speak.
[3819.70s -> 3838.89s]  See if you can find me. Okay. His ass is reading. What? He's not playing. He's not really playing.
[3838.89s -> 3852.25s]  What are you? Yes, I am. Hi. How's the city treating you? Getting some practical experience
[3852.25s -> 3857.35s]  on the streets? Coach, are we really getting stronger by running around like this? Doubting
[3857.35s -> 3863.78s]  the wisdom of old Luke Sensei, are you? Let's see where you're at then. Don't worry about taking
[3863.78s -> 3870.41s]  turns. Both of you. Let's go. All right. Let's go. I'm going to jump. I'm going to jump, kick,
[3870.41s -> 3875.45s]  only grab. You do grabs only. Jump, kick, only grabs. Grabbing, grabbing, grabbing, grabbing.
[3877.37s -> 3899.70s]  Grab. I thought that guy in the back was about to jump in and punch us. Nice. Rising up for cut.
[3901.13s -> 3917.29s]  What are you going to do? Shit. Get in there and you do something. Oh my God. I keep getting caught.
[3920.46s -> 3942.10s]  God damn it. Level 10. Do you know how to block? This is a, you're supposed to lose this. You hold
[3942.10s -> 3948.10s]  back to block. I know how to block. I played Street Fighter one when you were, when you were
[3948.10s -> 3975.80s]  in a crib. Okay. I played Street Fighter one when you were in a crib. He's crying. It was a bad voice
[3975.80s -> 3987.24s]  crack. It's okay though. You just got to take it one step at a time. Yeah. I got to get rid of
[3987.24s -> 3999.29s]  this beard. That first step you both took just now, it's something to be proud of. Man, you two are
[3999.29s -> 4018.90s]  great students. Okay. Enrolled. We did it. You became Luke's student. You can now use his master
[4018.90s -> 4027.98s]  action. Becoming the student of a legendary fighter, let's grant you access to their style,
[4027.98s -> 4032.70s]  which you can turn, in turn use in battle. Each style includes moves specific to that
[4032.70s -> 4035.90s]  legendary fighter. Seek out legendary fighters and find a style that works for you.
[4036.87s -> 4041.59s]  Unique attacks are normal moves that possess special properties. How many you have and what
[4041.59s -> 4047.26s]  they do depends on which master's style you're using. Attacks can be performed by using the left
[4047.26s -> 4051.90s]  stick and an attack button together. But if you'd rather not worry about doing them accidentally,
[4051.90s -> 4057.42s]  you can always remove them from your move list altogether. Just keep in mind that they're all
[4057.42s -> 4080.57s]  usable by default. I have to read it. I have to know what I'm doing. You got a grade four reading?
[4086.97s -> 4091.05s]  Go watch my sorcery playthrough. You tell me how good I am at reading and dictation.
[4091.37s -> 4096.94s]  Then the two of you can go and travel the world. You can really get to know each other
[4097.58s -> 4107.19s]  and take on all comers. Seriously, you'll have a blast. Speaking of which, I'm sorry. I can't.
[4107.99s -> 4114.01s]  I need to be strong and I need to be it now. I'm not like you. I can't go around treating
[4114.01s -> 4121.30s]  this like a game. Bosh. Come on coach. I'm done with the course. Look at that hat on.
[4121.86s -> 4128.25s]  Things I need to take care of. But you're right. This did give me some confidence. Thank you.
[4128.97s -> 4132.52s]  My fight ended in a draw. Wish we could have had a rematch.
[4132.52s -> 4137.64s]  The cinematographer hates this character and never line up a shot correctly.
[4138.20s -> 4151.37s]  It's always going to look wrong. I think he was hacking at Bosh. Chasing after his strength in
[4151.37s -> 4156.57s]  a mad rush is a recipe for disaster. Let's just hope he doesn't stumble down any weird rabbit holes.
[4157.29s -> 4162.18s]  You know, to be honest, I don't consider myself much of a teacher.
[4163.40s -> 4168.12s]  Rez said I was too much of a hothead and had me teach new students to help chill me out a bit.
[4169.16s -> 4172.44s]  I'm giving it the old college try, but maybe my methods could use a little work.
[4173.08s -> 4179.64s]  Maybe that does it for today's lesson. I'll contact you using this sucker moving forward.
[4180.68s -> 4185.16s]  Ah, that's right. If you see Alice tell her I said thanks for helping out with the lesson plan.
[4185.16s -> 4190.34s]  Yeah. She's got a ton to teach you. So I hope you two don't beat each other up too much.
[4196.18s -> 4215.70s]  Nah, nah. All right. Yeah, not that impressive. I beat this guy's ass 10 minutes ago.
[4223.67s -> 4228.79s]  Came all the way over here just to thank little old me. Come on. It's been my pleasure.
[4231.08s -> 4237.64s]  Your character sucks ass. Start over. No. Guys, this is like Elden Ring.
[4238.70s -> 4246.20s]  I'm going to make like 15 characters eventually, right? I'm going to get my first move in Elden
[4246.20s -> 4251.18s]  Ring and just be like, nah, fuck this. I'm doing something else. I'm playing. It's like I'm doing
[4251.18s -> 4265.22s]  pyromancy. Never mind. You're not touching this game after the stream. Oh, yeah. What a pull up.
[4265.78s -> 4274.34s]  What a pull up. Will I play this game again after today? Yes or no. What a pull up. Let's put your
[4274.34s -> 4287.13s]  money where your mouth is. Let's see it. Yeah. Now cut to me. Cut to me at Evo. I've been screaming.
[4287.13s -> 4294.31s]  The crowd is fucking electric and there's a thumb cam down on my controller. Just like
[4299.83s -> 4304.57s]  everyone stands up. Everyone's standing and I flawless victory every opponent.
[4304.57s -> 4315.32s]  Well, I'm not going to do that, but it'd be fun. Strength is something we all must find on our own
[4315.32s -> 4329.35s]  and in order to find it, you've got to talk to people just like you're doing now. Okay. Legends.
[4330.36s -> 4333.40s]  Take my style. For example, I learned it from a fighter named Chun Li.
[4334.20s -> 4337.72s]  If you're looking for a guidepost towards strength to call your very own,
[4337.72s -> 4342.28s]  be well worth heading to Chinatown to meet with Chun Li and learn her style.
[4342.28s -> 4357.59s]  Actually, we had another raid. Yeah, I didn't even see it. I was too busy talking about
[4357.59s -> 4362.47s]  Captain Planet or something. That was Sips. Sips came in with the raid. I don't know how long
[4362.47s -> 4368.12s]  ago that was. 10 minutes maybe. But welcome. Thanks for the raid. Welcome, everybody.
[4368.12s -> 4372.73s]  Points called miles are earned throughout the game by performing various actions.
[4373.66s -> 4382.55s]  Ooh, whoa. Wow. The city can save a wealth of things to see and do. You can chat with the people
[4382.55s -> 4389.78s]  you meet, do part-time jobs for Zenny or even find rare items in the most unexpected of places.
[4389.78s -> 4423.46s]  All right, let's go. I'm ready. All right. What do I do first? Let's go. Why does he keep? Why is he
[4423.46s -> 4435.99s]  only fighting pedestrians? This is a level five. It's not my fault that it's not my fault that
[4435.99s -> 4447.13s]  that character stinks. All right. What do I have? Items. Hard candy. You can lick your way to its
[4447.13s -> 4467.69s]  nutritious center. Oh, this is in battle. Oh, iron hard caramels. That sounds awful. Okay. So
[4467.69s -> 4486.62s]  we need to go to Chinatown. Okay. Break your teeth. Yeah. I can use the phone. Hey, you're
[4486.62s -> 4490.78s]  going to travel all over to get stronger from here on out, right? Probably as good a time as any to
[4490.78s -> 4497.11s]  take the bus. Chinatown's that away. Hard to miss its big gate. Anyway, good luck out there.
[4497.67s -> 4503.02s]  Okay. I'm getting a bus stop for the first time. It'll become available as fast travel location.
[4503.66s -> 4507.02s]  I can view the map and your device will allow you to travel there. All right. So it's fast travel.
[4507.02s -> 4516.23s]  Cool. So make sure you unlock every bus stop. Okay. Wait, this Pete's over here.
[4516.79s -> 4546.70s]  I have a car. Whoa. Fight the mime. Where's there a mime? Fight the mime. I don't see a mime.
[4547.26s -> 4566.78s]  Where's this mime? Is a mime like the pizza guy again? No, I've already beaten him up twice.
[4571.94s -> 4583.88s]  Oh, here's the mime. Like, do people know what I'm about to do?
[4586.92s -> 4617.06s]  Do people just fight each other? Stop running away. The mime is not fighting. Oh,
[4617.78s -> 4657.54s]  the mime is talking. That's true. Oh, punish counter. Level six. Let's go. Okay. Earning
[4657.54s -> 4662.90s]  enough styles at EXP will cause that style's rank to increase. If you increase your style rank,
[4662.90s -> 4666.68s]  your master in that style might teach you new moves the next time you talk to them.
[4666.68s -> 4673.51s]  Oh, okay. While exploring the city, you may sometimes notice citizens with
[4673.51s -> 4679.11s]  master icons attached to them. These citizens are talented fighters who use the moves of that icon's
[4679.11s -> 4684.31s]  corresponding legendary fighter and will yield a large amount of style experience. Ooh. Okay.
[4685.11s -> 4708.68s]  Anybody have that? Who are you? No. What about you? No. Uppercut somebody. I missed. All right.
[4708.68s -> 4726.63s]  Let's go to Chinatown. So, where's the bus? How do I? How do I? Got a metro free pass? Yes. Oh,
[4726.63s -> 4733.51s]  I don't. So, this is now just a travel point. All right. So, how do I get to?
[4735.75s -> 4764.58s]  I just walk, I guess. Can I get up there and fight these guys? That's terrifying. Oh, shit.
[4764.58s -> 4773.69s]  Watcher, I'm a hero. I protect the city from the shadows. I sense destiny in our meeting here.
[4773.69s -> 4782.09s]  Care to talk shop? And by shop, I mean justice? Yeah. Allow me to begin. There was once a young
[4782.09s -> 4789.29s]  man seeking strength. He traveled here to Metro City. On his first night, he went in search of
[4789.29s -> 4795.70s]  food to sate his empty stomach. But along the way, he encountered foul ruffians who stripped him of
[4795.70s -> 4800.58s]  every of his possession. If the story ended there, it would be just another tale from the mean
[4800.58s -> 4806.76s]  streets of Metro City. But all my friend ended did not. A martial artist intervened, aiming to
[4806.76s -> 4813.06s]  strike down the rampaging ruffians. And strike them down he did. And they all lived happily ever
[4813.06s -> 4818.74s]  after, perhaps, had the story ended there. You see, the fighter chose to re-leave the gang members
[4818.74s -> 4825.34s]  of their money. It was their reward for winning, you see. In that very moment, the young man had
[4825.34s -> 4832.57s]  an epiphany. Martial artists and gang goons are cut from the same cloth. Strike down evil is a
[4832.57s -> 4839.51s]  righteous act. All right, you want to go? That's not enough. One's reasons for striking down evil
[4839.51s -> 4843.98s]  and their sportsmanship afterward are equally important. When you raise your fist, you must
[4843.98s -> 4849.93s]  do so for just and meaningful purposes. You're a fighter, hmm? Is there meaning guiding your
[4849.93s -> 4857.42s]  fists? I don't know yet. Hmm, I see. You'll find a clear answer to that question in time, I imagine.
[4857.67s -> 4859.99s]  You must never forget to fight with a spirit of righteousness.
[4859.99s -> 4861.27s]  Sorry for the trouble.
[4861.27s -> 4863.27s]  Ah, listen to me blabbing, I'm sorry about that.
[4863.27s -> 4867.08s]  Here it is. Thanks for listening to my story. No need to be shy now, take it.
[4867.08s -> 4877.69s]  Ooh, okay. Fully restore his vitality and drive gauge. Well, now I'm going to kick the shit out of
[4877.69s -> 4926.71s]  you. Capcom, man! Back up. All right, this is bullshit, but it's working. All right, would I
[4926.71s -> 4942.68s]  get booed? Would I get booed if I was doing this in a tournament? Whoa, what happened? Oh, he
[4942.68s -> 4961.54s]  countered it. Not if it was working. A win is a win. Okay, yeah. Are there any diminishing returns?
[4962.10s -> 4988.44s]  I'm going to level up like five times after beating this guy. Oh my God, what am I doing?
[4988.44s -> 5007.34s]  Am I actually going to level up a shitload of times? Uh oh, bad. This is bad. This is really
[5007.34s -> 5013.72s]  bad. I don't know what he's doing. Why did I go against, why did I go against the fucking formula?
[5013.72s -> 5017.94s]  Why did I do that? That was stupid. I could have beat him. I don't know why I got bored.
[5020.09s -> 5027.27s]  Let me continue. Somebody resident sleepered and I freaked out and had to punch him twice.
[5027.27s -> 5048.22s]  I'm not even going to look at chat. God damn it. Whatever. Okay, well at least it shows them on the
[5048.22s -> 5071.72s]  map. I'll be back. What did I just do to that guy? Who am I fighting? Oh, it's 2v1. All right.
[5072.44s -> 5093.82s]  That was not even, that was simple. Nice. That looks awful. You were at the very bottom of the
[5093.82s -> 5097.50s]  bag of cheese and you were like, you know what? I already have the dough out and I already have the
[5097.50s -> 5108.70s]  sauce out. I have to, I have to make it work. There's like 15 strands of cheese left. Stop
[5108.70s -> 5113.90s]  being mean. I just don't like that. I don't like pizza like that. I have to have the perfect level
[5114.94s -> 5141.75s]  of, perfect level of cheese and sauce. 3v1. Oh shit. This guy's level 14 and 15. How am I
[5141.75s -> 5162.58s]  going to beat this? I'm kind of doing it though. Is there another one? How many people are there
[5162.58s -> 5177.13s]  in this? That was pretty good. No. God damn it. I fucking knew it was going to hit me.
[5185.45s -> 5200.36s]  Shit. Guess level 15. All right. I'm going to Chinatown. Oh, that's right. I have items.
[5200.36s -> 5205.69s]  I can take them in the middle of a fight, right? When are you going to play the actual game?
[5206.49s -> 5211.50s]  This is the game. Are you asking when I'm going to play multiplayer online matches?
[5213.56s -> 5220.76s]  The hell? I don't know. This is what I wanted to play. What? So you can stream snipe me and
[5220.76s -> 5225.40s]  beat me in fucking 10 seconds. That's what you want. That's why you want me to do that.
[5228.23s -> 5232.92s]  You're sitting there hovering over the join match button. It's like, Oh, help I get queued up with
[5232.92s -> 5255.14s]  them so I can literally do one combo and kill them. Of course you can fight with your creator
[5255.14s -> 5291.61s]  characters. That's awesome. I'll definitely do it. IRL street fighter. Whoa. I'm disappointed in you.
[5297.56s -> 5309.78s]  It's on Lee. Could I get a selfie? Just real quick, real quick. Sorry for the trouble involved.
[5309.78s -> 5332.30s]  I'm Chunlin. Is there something I can help you with? Teach me. It actually, there actually is
[5332.30s -> 5343.51s]  a selfie system. That's funny. Okay. I had a long career as a fighter myself, faced all kinds of
[5343.51s -> 5348.71s]  opponents that includes seriously powerful foes and friends forged in the fires of competition.
[5349.43s -> 5357.22s]  I'm apparently uninterested after all these years of fighting. I decided it might be time for break.
[5357.22s -> 5362.02s]  So I'm here teaching the locals Kung Fu. I can't promise it will provide you with the strength
[5362.02s -> 5382.68s]  you're looking for, but I happen to teach you a thing or two. Okay. This really is just a random
[5382.68s -> 5388.58s]  character. Every button was pressed and randomized. There was no thought that went into this at all.
[5405.72s -> 5432.02s]  All right. Oh, not good enough. Not good enough. Wow. So epic.
[5439.22s -> 5461.66s]  All right. So now I can use Chun Li's moves. Ooh, spinning bird kick. So you have,
[5461.66s -> 5474.94s]  you can only use a certain style at once. You can't combine moves. Okay. Oh, wait, no. All right.
[5474.94s -> 5486.49s]  Ooh. So I can combine them. Oh, shit. That's actually pretty cool. All right. So let me do
[5486.49s -> 5508.31s]  that. Special moves. So do I want rising uppercut or do I want the flash knuckle? I think I want
[5508.31s -> 5527.77s]  the range. I want this. I like this move. All right. So this is forward and this is just standard.
[5527.77s -> 5552.62s]  Okay. Let's try it. Let's go. All right. How do I do it? How do I do it? Whoa. How do I just do that?
[5553.26s -> 5577.29s]  Am I missing something? Hold back and then forward. Back, forward. Back, forward. Back, forward.
[5579.30s -> 5587.85s]  Back, forward Y. Back, forward Y. Back, forward Y. Back, forward Y. Back, forward Y. Forward special.
[5589.18s -> 5607.22s]  Forward Y. Forward Y. What's happening here? Do I have to charge it for a bit? Oh, that was weird.
[5607.78s -> 5620.95s]  How did I just do that? Yeah, but I'm on modern controls. Okay. Hold on. Let me go. Wait.
[5620.95s -> 5635.37s]  Back, forward. Yeah, but isn't it modern? Oh, hold back, press Y. Hold forward, press Y.
[5638.55s -> 5648.54s]  It's just forward Y. Forward Y. Forward Y. Forward Y. How's it not working? Hold forward Y.
[5648.54s -> 5656.95s]  I'm just, I'm doing it. Hold back and press special. It's not doing it either.
[5657.51s -> 5671.32s]  I don't even know how the fuck I just did that. I just tried, I tried every single combination.
[5673.98s -> 5677.58s]  Hold for one second then forward Y. I did that like probably 30 times in a row.
[5678.22s -> 5693.02s]  I don't understand what's going on. You weren't holding back for long enough.
[5693.02s -> 5709.75s]  How come I'm all the way back here? Where's the moves list? I'm so far away.
[5710.31s -> 5732.87s]  Charge inputs are not easy. I wasn't, I wasn't holding back long enough. I'll figure it out.
[5732.87s -> 5741.08s]  Okay. You can check who you're studying. Got it. All right. Let me try this again.
[5745.18s -> 5754.90s]  One. Okay. Holding one. I'm holding back. Forward Y. Hold forward, back Y. Don't move at all. Press Y.
[5756.06s -> 5766.86s]  Back, forward Y. Back, forward Y. Back, forward Y. Forward, back Y. Down, back Y.
[5769.53s -> 5799.72s]  One, two, three, forward Y. I don't get it. Press Y while holding forward. That's what I'm doing
[5799.72s -> 5805.56s]  right now. All right. I, I, what just happened right there? Hold Y. Forward. Okay. It's, you have,
[5805.56s -> 5810.60s]  it's only, it's only walking forward. It's walk forward for two seconds and then Y. Not back,
[5810.60s -> 5816.20s]  forward Y. Back, forward Y. You have to, you have to walk forward for a full almost two seconds.
[5817.42s -> 5836.76s]  Like that. Or back. Nope. Back does not work. I feel like that's not very good. Yeah. If I,
[5836.76s -> 5842.68s]  okay. I'm hold, I'm going to hold back. One, two, three. Doesn't do anything. I'm holding forward.
[5842.68s -> 5854.14s]  One, one, two, three. Yeah. It's forward only. I feel like I would want to do the regular controls
[5854.14s -> 5859.42s]  for that one. I wonder if I could do it. I probably should just play with the regular controls.
[5864.89s -> 5893.53s]  Hold forward while crouching. Ah, now, now you got it. There we go. Yeah. You bumped into me.
[5893.53s -> 5914.92s]  Sorry, buddy. Forward. What? Yeah. I don't like that at all. I think I was going to play with the
[5914.92s -> 5935.10s]  regular controls. Do I do it in here? Controls, right? Uh, modern. Let's do classic. Let's try it.
[5935.10s -> 5963.58s]  So four back Y. Forward, back Y. Forward, back Y. Forward, back Y. Forward, back Y. Forward, back,
[5963.58s -> 5980.60s]  backward. Forward, back X. Forward, back X. Forward, back X. Forward, back. Wait, what?
[5982.49s -> 6019.26s]  Why did they get rid of my, did take it off? I need to re equip it. That combo Omega Lola.
[6020.22s -> 6026.30s]  Relax. Okay. I don't play Street Fighter. I don't play Street Fighter. You need to calm down.
[6026.30s -> 6032.10s]  Don't Omega Lola combo me. I'm going back to modern. Some people don't make fun of me.
[6032.10s -> 6047.48s]  I'm going to go back to modern. Some people don't like make fun of me. What's wrong with that?
[6047.48s -> 6058.33s]  Learn new actions from every master you study under. Cool. Street Fighter chat is toxic. No,
[6058.33s -> 6075.96s]  what the hell can you do? What? I kind of want to learn that. That seems ridiculous. Okay. Well,
[6075.96s -> 6091.69s]  I definitely want to do that. All right. Special moves. What happened? Oh, this is how I do this.
[6091.69s -> 6102.31s]  All right. All right. So forward, back, doesn't do it back. It's only forward. It's only Y.
[6106.71s -> 6127.03s]  I'm going to get you. Ouch. Ouch. Ouch. Now I'm angry. Ouch. Ouch. Anybody know what that is?
[6127.03s -> 6168.04s]  All right. How do I get out of here? All right. Down, up. Yeah. Wouldn't that cool? All right.
[6168.04s -> 6200.09s]  So how do I do it? It's forward and Y, right? Oh shit. I'm going to lose. No, we're good. We're
[6200.09s -> 6213.10s]  good. All right. Cool. I'm just leveling up. All right. I'm going to, we'll do a little bit more
[6213.10s -> 6220.01s]  and then I'm going to take it online and they get destroyed for a little while and you can all laugh.
[6220.57s -> 6226.41s]  Everybody can clip the moments where I get flawless. Didn't you know what I mean? Like
[6226.41s -> 6288.18s]  we'll do that in like 10 minutes. Am I not on Chun-Li style? Oh, are you ready? Holy shit.
[6288.18s -> 6303.26s]  Hold forward and Y. Oh, it's different because it's different character.
[6303.26s -> 6310.89s]  Dude, Jerma sucks at fighting games. That's fine. I'm going to have my fun playing the game.
[6313.34s -> 6317.08s]  You can get good. You can get to rank two, whatever you want to get to.
[6326.42s -> 6344.71s]  Almost level 10. All right. Anything else to do? Oh, you sup. Get to rank 10.
[6347.24s -> 6350.36s]  Should I do the thing that people are going to be so pissed off though?
[6351.00s -> 6357.53s]  When I play online, you guys are going to hear a lot of this because I'm,
[6357.53s -> 6364.25s]  I'm just going to hit every single button. And I know that people hate that, but he's a masher.
[6364.25s -> 6388.63s]  I know I'll try. It's okay. I do that too. Yeah. I think a lot of us. Okay. Well, you can discover
[6388.63s -> 6394.55s]  the style that's truly yours. And the only time you can do that is in combat. I got to put some
[6394.55s -> 6422.25s]  clothing on. Do you mind keeping an eye? Uh, talented. Okay. All right. That full body is.
[6423.38s -> 6442.70s]  All right. I can at least put pants on. There we go. I still have to learn how to do supers and
[6442.70s -> 6456.47s]  stuff and drive gauge. And I don't know how to do any of that. Okay. Okay. You don't go,
[6456.47s -> 6466.78s]  you don't get it till chapter six. Should I take it online? What do you think? We're taking it
[6466.78s -> 6486.09s]  online. Let's go hit up the basic tutorial. All right. I love this mode. I'm definitely
[6486.09s -> 6496.01s]  going to play it off stream. But did you guys do a poll to determine if I was going to play
[6496.01s -> 6508.46s]  this ever again? What was the, what was the percentages? Okay. Most people online space to
[6508.46s -> 6525.13s]  play. Okay. Let's go. 66% said no. Okay. Quick join. Okay. I think I'm going to do quick join.
[6537.21s -> 6542.47s]  Okay. I'm not ready. I am not ready.
[6545.51s -> 6553.64s]  Not in a bad way. Of course. In an amazing way. So this is where I'd usually say you can go
[6553.64s -> 6560.97s]  wherever and do whatever. But wait, is these other, are these other players? I'm sure you're
[6560.97s -> 6566.25s]  going to have a lot of questions. This is your first time, right? He's going to rage quit.
[6566.25s -> 6572.63s]  No, I won't. Can we have a face cam for this? You want to see me my face when I lose? Yeah,
[6572.63s -> 6579.26s]  we'll do in a minute. Hold on. The various points around here. Each one has a handy little
[6579.26s -> 6587.40s]  instruction pop up. So don't be nervous. Look at that. Look at that devil. Look at that devil.
[6587.40s -> 6610.20s]  Go explore and have some filter usernames. Oh, should I? Okay. Okay. Okay.
[6614.49s -> 6639.46s]  Somebody made a puppy. Okay. I like puppy. So where do I go? Look, I can tell who installed
[6639.46s -> 6644.10s]  the game 20 minutes ago. We all have the, you installed the game 20 minutes ago pants.
[6653.88s -> 6678.12s]  Whoa. Hold on. Come here. This is awesome. This is so cool. Let's go. Oh, whatever. All right. Who
[6678.12s -> 6688.04s]  wants to fight? Does anybody want to fight? Okay. I think, can I challenge somebody to a duel?
[6692.81s -> 6705.42s]  How do you fight people? How do I? All right, let's do it. I'm ready. No, no, no. I want to fight.
[6705.42s -> 6714.04s]  How do we fight? Oh, who did I just fight? I don't know who this is. Apparently,
[6714.04s -> 6756.86s]  they're an extreme rookie though. That's good for me. Let's go. Oh, shit. I got grabbed. I'm
[6756.86s -> 6787.42s]  gonna try. Oh, that was a grab midair. What just happened? Good blocks. Good blocks. Good blocks.
[6793.21s -> 6907.29s]  Shit. Don't do this to me. I won. I won. I did it. Oh, fuck. I fucked up. I fucked up. I'm sorry. I
[6907.29s -> 6915.16s]  fucked up. That was my fault. I fucked it up. I fucked up. That's my fault. I screwed up. That's
[6915.16s -> 6930.18s]  my fault. That was my fault. I did that. That was stupid. But we're fine. It's my fault. He's back.
[6930.18s -> 6946.30s]  All right. Let's go. And everybody can come and swarm me again. Come and swarm me. I was worried.
[6954.23s -> 6964.42s]  Yeah. That's my own problem. I crashed it out. All right. I'm ready for a challenger. If anybody is
[6964.42s -> 6973.82s]  there, please. Ezfan was here. Wait. Did Ezfan raid right when I did that? Oh, that's unfortunate.
[6982.86s -> 6999.05s]  All right. Let's go. I'm ready to fight for real now. What happened? I accidentally turned my
[6999.05s -> 7019.08s]  fucking internet off. Don't ask me how. This first just destroyed me. What? I closed out of OBS.
[7019.08s -> 7026.38s]  I turned my fucking internet off. I just fucked up. It wasn't a rage quit and it wasn't a bit. I
[7026.38s -> 7060.02s]  promise. All right. I got that too. All right. Bring it back. Shit. No. Are these the people
[7060.02s -> 7081.50s]  watching us? No. Did I beat him or did I? Oh, that's too bad. No, rematch, rematch, rematch,
[7081.50s -> 7105.16s]  rematch. Let's do it again. Okay. That was good. Shit. What the fuck, man? Come on. Oh, my god.
[7105.16s -> 7141.19s]  Damn it. Wait, his arms are longer. Fuck. How do I do moves? Shit. All right. I'm doing something
[7141.19s -> 7158.22s]  else. No, that was fun. Good game. Good game. Try a new character. How do you even play as a
[7158.22s -> 7169.27s]  different character? Can we just take everybody to the arcade or something? Like, can we just go ride
[7169.27s -> 7187.98s]  rides at an amusement park? Oh, my goodness. How do you even make that? It kind of is a Roblox
[7187.98s -> 7212.04s]  lavia. Wait, what? Wait, we can play these? Can we play those together? This is really cool. Level
[7212.04s -> 7226.70s]  66. Holy shit. All right. How do I play with a different character? Can I pick a different
[7226.70s -> 7234.44s]  character? Press X. Oh, okay. Here's the battle settings. Character, choose your character,
[7234.44s -> 7254.55s]  fighter profile. Okay. Who are these? Oh, all right. Okay. So who's good? I want to try this
[7254.55s -> 7271.80s]  character. Oh, Blanca. Title setting. Let's do this. Yeah, that's fine. Okay. Did I confirm it?
[7271.80s -> 7292.10s]  All right. I'm ready for a challenge. Anybody there? This person has three win streak.
[7292.10s -> 7307.78s]  Yeah. Oh, it's. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All
[7307.78s -> 7324.79s]  right. All right. All right. This character is distracting. Yeah, it's playing a platform game
[7324.79s -> 7335.42s]  and that this bro has five. Why did you get all this health? Look at this person's health. Is this
[7335.42s -> 7351.37s]  for real? Nope. Is that their health bar? What? You don't have three health bars, do you? This person
[7351.37s -> 7374.94s]  has three. How is this possible? How do I do that? How do I do that move? That's so unfair.
[7374.94s -> 7386.34s]  This guy's got two extra health bars. What the hell? All right. I'm going to play as a different.
[7386.34s -> 7401.29s]  I want to play as a character. Okay. Character. Should I go just to the main menu? Go to a cabinet.
[7401.29s -> 7417.98s]  Fight against other players. Oh, okay. I joined Q. Um, reserve player one side.
[7418.78s -> 7428.07s]  Am I doing it right? Okay. Spectate while waiting, I guess.
[7445.82s -> 7468.95s]  You need to. That felt weird. All right. Nice. Nice. Oh, this is you can fast forward. Wait,
[7469.59s -> 7484.23s]  I just gave a thumbs up. Do you know that you're not playing? Yeah, I'm in the queue to play.
[7484.47s -> 7519.99s]  Beautiful fight. I'm queued up. All right. All right. This person knows how to play.
[7519.99s -> 7536.86s]  That face. Holy shit. Wow. That was cool. Hey, somebody said, Hey, is there a streamer here?
[7536.86s -> 7552.54s]  Yeah. XQC. That's not. So what the fuck happened? Well, I know. All right. All right. I'm going
[7553.26s -> 7561.86s]  change character costume. That's fine. All right. Am I ready? No, I want to get away from this one.
[7562.66s -> 7586.38s]  All right. Sit down. Yes. Just queue for a match on the mat. This is me. This is me. All right.
[7586.38s -> 7627.72s]  This is me. This is me. Oh, mirror match. You got it. Shit. What did I just do? What am I shortening
[7627.72s -> 7636.04s]  my butt to him for? What does this do? Oh my God. I need to, I need to do the tutorial of the video
[7636.04s -> 7680.58s]  game. Okay. They didn't. What? Ow. Whoa. That was a cool move. Whoa. Oh, somebody learned how to play.
[7681.38s -> 7722.49s]  What's wrong with me? Ow. Oh yeah. Well, what about this shit? What's wrong with me? Why am I on
[7722.49s -> 7744.52s]  drugs? Why am I on fucking crack? What's wrong with me? How do you do a super? How do I do super?
[7748.68s -> 7798.86s]  Oh, Y and B at the same time. You mean like that? All right. It's all right. It's all right. It's
[7798.86s -> 7816.41s]  all right. Adorable. Jerma thinks he can play. Yeah. It's fine. I don't know what the fuck's
[7816.41s -> 7824.14s]  going on. That doesn't matter. I'm having fun. All right. I want to play as a different character.
[7824.78s -> 7854.70s]  All right. I'm going to sit at this one. You all fell for it. Okay. The tutorial would help you a
[7854.70s -> 7866.39s]  lot. Yeah, I know. Cause I know there's like a parry. There's that paint move where you paint
[7867.27s -> 7893.46s]  there's a whole super meter thing. There's a whole, there's a whole thing here. Shit. Shit.
[7895.30s -> 7921.29s]  That did a lot of damage. Holy shit. Ow. What the fuck? The only way to get good is slamming your
[7921.29s -> 7969.91s]  head against the brick wall. Oh, air grab. What does that do? Give me that grab. Give me the grab.
[7976.30s -> 8006.22s]  Oh no. What was that? All right. I'll be back. I'm going to go do the tutorial.
[8017.34s -> 8021.37s]  All right. Everybody come over here. Stand right here. Facing this direction.
[8022.33s -> 8030.74s]  Right here. Facing this direction, please. Okay. Stand here and face, uh, face me, please.
[8031.46s -> 8045.72s]  No, not in front of me over on the white line. Okay. So everybody come over here. Only like 10
[8045.72s -> 8054.38s]  of you are actually listening. I feel like I've had dreams where this was what was happening.
[8055.61s -> 8062.86s]  Okay. You ready? I'm telling you, we're going to play something here. You ready?
[8064.49s -> 8081.90s]  Simon says walk one step forward. Nice. Nice. Okay. Step back. Ah, you, you moved a little.
[8081.90s -> 8096.95s]  You moved a little. All right. Now let's fucking go. How do I challenge? All right. Simon says do
[8096.95s -> 8117.80s]  a full lap around the whole hub back here. Well, y'all lose. He's taking a picture, taking a selfie.
[8117.80s -> 8140.20s]  Oh, hold on a minute. Oh shit. I just hit like five people. Is that bad? All right. I'm going
[8140.20s -> 8147.21s]  to go learn how to play the game. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'm just going to learn
[8147.21s -> 8166.38s]  how to play the game. All right, let's go. All right. We know how to do this. We know how to do
[8166.38s -> 8169.58s]  this. We know how to do this. We know how to do this. We know how to do this. What's this?
[8170.14s -> 8180.98s]  Let's do a quick review of drive impacts. If your opponent's in the corner and you hit them,
[8180.98s -> 8197.05s]  the drive impact. Okay. Okay. So there are some situations where this crush date won't occur.
[8197.61s -> 8215.26s]  Okay. Well, I think we have to go back a few steps. Here we go. All right. The drive gauge.
[8216.92s -> 8222.94s]  These are powerful up special moves that consume two drive gauge blocks. I'm using a special move
[8222.94s -> 8229.80s]  that has an overdrive version. Press. Okay. Instead of one of the. All right. Overdrive
[8229.80s -> 8235.40s]  arts have different properties than their standard counterparts. Just do the first one. God fucking
[8235.40s -> 8265.93s]  damn it. Okay. Dashing. Yep. Why am I on classic? How come I can't change this? Why does this keep
[8265.93s -> 8286.70s]  changing? Why does this keep changing? You pick the classic tutorial. Oh, come on. All right.
[8286.70s -> 8310.22s]  I'll get it in 10 minutes. And then I'm going back in there and I'm going to dominate. Yep.
[8310.22s -> 8329.16s]  It's dashing. Cool. Cool. Jumping. Yep. Okay. Good jumps. Normal attacks. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.
[8330.78s -> 8353.18s]  Uh huh. Down. Yep. Jump. Yep. Yep. Standing block and crouching block. That's good to know.
[8353.18s -> 8372.78s]  I didn't know that. Uh huh. See, I'm getting it. Okay. Crouch block. Yeah. I don't think
[8372.78s -> 8388.79s]  you would have figured that out right away. Yep. Okay. Throw escape by pressing X and A at the same
[8388.79s -> 8404.79s]  time. Check your timing. Escape my throw. Oh, that's how you do it. All right. Nice. Okay. Yep.
[8404.79s -> 8425.35s]  Special moves. Rising up a cut. Nope. Okay. Here we go. This is it. Three levels. You have at least
[8425.35s -> 8432.62s]  one you can perform a super art. Level one super art. Okay. Level one super art with either of
[8432.62s -> 8443.54s]  these. Forward B and Y. This is a level one super art. It's forward B and Y. Level two short range.
[8444.50s -> 8457.13s]  So it's away from your opponent. So you got to go like wham. Okay. Yep. All right. So you got to go
[8457.13s -> 8465.02s]  like wham. Modern control scream. Omega low. No, that's fine. Look, if you know that I'm already
[8465.02s -> 8469.18s]  using modern controls, you probably, you probably left the stream like an hour ago. That's fine.
[8469.18s -> 8484.87s]  It's all good. So you go wham. All right. I get it now. So that's how you do that. But what about
[8484.87s -> 8492.38s]  the left bumper thing I was pressing? Sure. We'll get it right now. Okay. There it is. All right.
[8492.38s -> 8498.86s]  The six bar display shown here is known as the it indicates a fighter's concentration energy level.
[8498.86s -> 8506.94s]  Utilizing this gauge lets you perform unique actions. Okay. First off is the drive impact.
[8506.94s -> 8511.98s]  Press left bumper to perform a powerful attack. Just left bumper. Got it. So that uses one cube.
[8514.66s -> 8518.10s]  They can absorb two attacks from the opponent, but there are some exceptions. When you're in
[8518.10s -> 8524.36s]  trouble, use the drive impact to break through an attack. Oh, so that's how you could, that's how
[8524.36s -> 8548.07s]  you stop somebody from doing a combo. Okay. Didn't I just do it? I'm not doing it. Press A dude. Oh,
[8551.48s -> 8561.83s]  while I'm blocking. So it goes through block. All right. So it's mainly to get out of combos.
[8561.83s -> 8580.39s]  I was using it as a, like a punch drive parry. Okay. So that's how you replenish the gauge.
[8582.31s -> 8588.90s]  They cannot defend against throws. Try them out in real fight. While I perform a drive parry,
[8588.90s -> 8598.81s]  press X and A at the same time to throw me. Yep. Okay. You don't want to use it in combos.
[8600.18s -> 8605.30s]  Perfect parry is performing a drive parry. The moment an opponent attacks, it's you. Okay.
[8606.18s -> 8619.53s]  All right. Drive impacts are powerful to use for any fighter. Okay. So drive, you can use drive
[8619.53s -> 8634.01s]  parry. Got it. Too much information. I'm going to go hit my sandbag. So parrying is insanely
[8634.01s -> 8657.50s]  important, especially if you're in the corner. Okay. Yep. Okay. Burnout. The drive impact and
[8658.30s -> 8662.46s]  drive parry are great uses of the drive gauge, but continuous use will drain the gauge. And if
[8662.46s -> 8668.86s]  you drain it completely, you'll be unable to use it for a period of time. All right. So that's why
[8668.86s -> 8684.73s]  I thought I was like on drugs and you get stunned. Okay. All right. When a fighter is in burnout,
[8684.73s -> 8688.73s]  they can still be stunned even if they block a drive impact. Remember chasing someone into the
[8688.73s -> 8697.69s]  corner gives you more chances. All right. I get, I think I got it now. I think I'm good. Okay. I'm
[8697.69s -> 8713.43s]  ready. Yeah. I'm good to go. Name one move that was introduced. Drive parry, drive gauge, drive
[8713.43s -> 8720.63s]  impacts, special one, special two, and special three. Special two is a hit back and press Y and
[8720.63s -> 8736.23s]  B. Special three is crouch and hit Y and B. I paid attention. And that person for 25 minutes.
[8736.23s -> 8772.06s]  There it is. There it is. I got it now. I got it now. What happens when your drive gauge is empty?
[8772.06s -> 8776.78s]  You get, you get into dazed mode and you get, you can get stunned. I win. And that person for four
[8776.78s -> 8809.94s]  hours. Go back to the hub. I love that you can just kind of hang out here. Doing tournaments like this
[8809.94s -> 8819.51s]  would be so much fun. You actually can participate. I definitely don't want to fight the person that
[8819.51s -> 8834.74s]  has three boss health bars. Hey dude, I bet you can't recite the first 20 lines of, of, of pie.
[8836.01s -> 8853.13s]  Um, the pie, the math problem was a three, um, three point four one five nine two six five three
[8853.13s -> 8878.33s]  five nine. Stage select. Ooh, hold on. Where do I want to go? Coliseum. Wait, I think I'm still,
[8878.33s -> 8885.13s]  I'm still Blanca, aren't I? Wait, no, no, it's this, it's this guy again. I don't want to fight
[8885.13s -> 8900.09s]  this person. They have too much. All right. Well, I learned a lot. So let's go. Wait, I don't have
[8900.09s -> 8957.00s]  any drive powers. This is just a leveled up version of my character. Shit. I'm wicked fucking
[8957.00s -> 9003.18s]  unpredictable. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I still have health. Damn it. Why can't I do
[9003.18s -> 9011.40s]  special moves anymore? I'm pressing why it's not doing anything. What the fuck are my moves?
[9012.28s -> 9057.30s]  I don't have any moves. Got him. How do I not have a move to do? Oh, it's because I'm story locked.
[9057.30s -> 9069.50s]  All right. I get it. I don't even have a super meter. Oh shit. Okay. I got to get out of here.
[9070.38s -> 9101.38s]  We got, okay. Let me play the regular game now. Jesus. I'll try Blanca again. All right. Here we
[9101.38s -> 9161.26s]  go. Now I know how to play. What? What? Oh, I'm not even in matchmaking. This person might have
[9161.26s -> 9189.26s]  a hundred hours in this game, right? Is that accurate? LOL. He's using, no, I'm not getting
[9189.26s -> 9218.74s]  better. Shit. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. No, it's not fair. I'm going to matchmaking. I'm going to matchmaking.
[9220.73s -> 9236.73s]  I'm going to matchmaking. That was fun. Everyone. Good job. All of you. Thanks for playing. All
[9236.73s -> 9242.04s]  right. I'm going to go do matchmaking to play against the real players of my skill level.
[9242.04s -> 9250.92s]  It was very, very good job. Nice work. But just do it from the pause menu. Can I do it from here?
[9251.56s -> 9268.38s]  Is he won a single game? Press X. Oh, ranked matches on like that. All right. What's the
[9268.38s -> 9302.71s]  character I would want to play with? Maybe Guile. Hmm. E Honda. I know if I play this character,
[9302.71s -> 9316.14s]  I'm going to spam X and people are going to get really bad at me. Oh, all right. I'm doing E
[9316.14s -> 9336.04s]  Honda. Fuck it. Let's go. Okay. I don't want to hear about spinning bird kick anymore. Get me away
[9336.04s -> 9365.14s]  from them. All right. This is a real challenge now. Let's go. All right. Good. Good. Nice hit.
[9365.14s -> 9401.53s]  Nice hit. Oh, good counter. Shit. Nice lock. All right. So we start. Let's get started. Let's go.
[9413.26s -> 9435.50s]  Land it. Oh, what? All right. All right. All right. Good throw escape. Good job, dude. All right. I'll
[9435.50s -> 9448.55s]  get it too. There we go. That's first one of the night. First win of the night. Thank God.
[9448.55s -> 9462.46s]  Finally, I do a rematch. I think you're right. This is a computer. How is this computer?
[9476.30s -> 9489.70s]  It's for placement. Oh, all right. I get it. Oh, I'm going to get put like,
[9490.58s -> 9506.94s]  I'm going to put in chicken league. No, I'm not. That's fine. It wasn't terrible.
[9509.06s -> 9554.38s]  Look, I could do more grabs. Way more grabs. Shit. You're getting better. That's good to hear. It's
[9554.38s -> 9574.92s]  fun. Back special is your best move. Okay. So now that's it, right? Quit. Uh, previous mode. How do
[9574.92s -> 9588.90s]  I just keep going? You got to learn the headbutt. Okay. Ranked match. I think it's still happening.
[9588.90s -> 9594.47s]  Okay, cool. Let's swarm his body and vibrate him to death like we're bees.
[9598.81s -> 9647.72s]  Okay. Hello. This is a real fight. This is a real person. Shit. Oh, he's caught up in a combo. Caught
[9647.72s -> 9659.02s]  up in a combo. Stop screaming for no reason. Like I'm, what am I doing? This guy's quick.
[9660.15s -> 9695.54s]  Ow. All right. That's a grab. What kind of move is that? How about back in YB, right?
[9697.42s -> 9711.54s]  Why won't he do it? How come I can't do my special move back in YB, back YB, back YB. Why is it not
[9711.54s -> 9725.24s]  working? Why is it not working? I had three bars. I, why, why couldn't I do back YB? I had three bars
[9727.56s -> 9738.98s]  back YB is two bar. Didn't I have three? You're on the right. I was doing, I was,
[9738.98s -> 9743.94s]  I was doing back YB. I'm promising you. It's different inputs for every account. Oh, come on.
[9743.94s -> 9772.94s]  Really? All right. Well, I didn't, I have no idea how to do them. God damn it. I'm just not fast
[9772.94s -> 9807.61s]  enough. Come on. Jesus. What the fuck? This guy's got insane zoning moves. It's just like an S tier
[9807.61s -> 9827.78s]  character. I feel like he is. I just did back YB and it didn't do anything. Whatever. There's
[9827.78s -> 9834.86s]  a genre of video game that I've put maybe collectively four hours of time into.
[9836.76s -> 9864.22s]  It's Street Fighter. I almost did it. I need a new character. Don't clap for me. I didn't win.
[9864.94s -> 9968.78s]  That should come out. I can do that too. Yo. Oh, good. Good counter. Oh shit. Back it up. I'm stunned.
[9968.78s -> 10005.19s]  I'm stunned. I'm stunned. I got to back it up. Shit. That's bad. Let's go. I won. I won one match.
[10005.75s -> 10045.34s]  I got to figure out how to do the other move. Oh, all right. I should have blocked it. Oh,
[10046.14s -> 10061.16s]  this game's fun. Even if I'm not very good at it. I'm learning though. I'm getting, I'm getting
[10061.16s -> 10107.74s]  better. Oh, nice job. Good job. Shit. Shit. Jump. Jump out of the way. I'm dead. All right. That was
[10107.74s -> 10114.41s]  better. I got to do combo try. Yeah. I mean, I could learn really genuinely how to play a character,
[10114.41s -> 10155.34s]  but I'm just having fun. It's all good. Got it. It's down. Shit. I almost blocked it. Shit. No.
[10156.46s -> 10163.66s]  Good. Good. Good. Good. All right. Okay. I need to figure out how to play the game.
[10170.89s -> 10192.20s]  I got to figure out how to play better and play combo trials. Here we go. And who do I actually
[10192.20s -> 10214.22s]  want to play with? Let's see. I don't know. Maybe character guide. It's DJ. Who's DJ? How
[10214.22s -> 10231.34s]  to play DJ. Okay. All right. Moves I can use to control the rhythm of battle.
[10234.20s -> 10271.91s]  Faints. Oh, that's cool. Seems fun. That's a lot of fake outs. Is that it? Okay. I'll try it. All
[10271.91s -> 10296.89s]  right. Rebeat combo. That's just X, X, X. Sure. DJ special board. Was it X board? I'm doing it,
[10296.89s -> 10342.01s]  right? Oh, whoa. Okay. A, B, B. Cool. Cool. Okay. What button is he pressing? Show inputs. Whoa.
[10342.81s -> 10357.70s]  Okay. Trial display method. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. There's too many buttons.
[10360.14s -> 10370.44s]  Command display. Oh, there we go. Okay. So what is it? Hold right trigger and then X, X.
[10371.32s -> 10381.59s]  Okay. Then it's cool. Whoa. This more of this. Holy shit. Okay. Well, I didn't do any of that.
[10381.59s -> 10424.50s]  It was cool. That's so cool. I just have to press one button. That's so fun. Okay. And then it's down.
[10424.50s -> 10466.55s]  Okay. How fast do we have to do it? There it is. Okay. Nice. All right. Intermediate
[10466.55s -> 10494.42s]  during a forward jump. Ooh, that'll catch people. Oh, there's more. Why? And then why? Why? Holy
[10494.42s -> 10512.14s]  shit. Okay. Well, connected with the special cancelable move. Forward, forward. Whoa. This
[10512.14s -> 10547.91s]  one's going to be hard. That's a lot of presses. Shit. Shit. Shit. Really? I can't string the
[10547.91s -> 10608.52s]  bottom B together. Did that work? That's going to be way too hard. Ooh, no, it's not. And then
[10608.52s -> 10623.21s]  it's right trigger A. I keep forgetting to hold right trigger. That's actually kind of hard to
[10623.21s -> 10653.93s]  do that. Holding right trigger and pressing A is kind of weird. Really? Shit. What is it supposed
[10653.93s -> 10660.12s]  to be? What is it? Let me see the move. After down B, what does it look like? Okay. You just have to
[10660.12s -> 10685.83s]  do it really fast. All right. No, I'm done. I'm going to sit here for like four hours to get that
[10685.83s -> 10722.02s]  done. I'm going to take it to the computer. Go to the beach. Who should I go against? Dengue?
[10722.82s -> 10739.21s]  There was more in the character guide. I pressed like A. We come up together. That's funny.
[10752.28s -> 10792.55s]  All right. X forward down B. Whoa. Okay. I just got to learn the combos.
[10792.55s -> 10823.46s]  That was close. You know, going the other direction is impossible for my brain to do in fighting
[10823.46s -> 10836.62s]  games. That combo I just learned has to be from left to right. You know what I mean? It's like
[10836.62s -> 10851.34s]  reading. I have to like do the whole thing backwards. It's funny. God damn it. Focus on
[10851.34s -> 10875.08s]  fundamentals first. That's true. I can't wait to watch people play because I like watching people
[10875.08s -> 10893.75s]  play things very well and they're probably going to do very good at this game. One time I played
[10894.31s -> 10901.46s]  Mortal Kombat, the newer one from like seven or eight years ago, and I sat in a call. I believe
[10901.46s -> 10909.43s]  I was in a call with like boo stealth stir and just practicing Kenshi's combo over and over again
[10909.43s -> 10915.67s]  for like four straight hours and just sitting there and just trying to get it burned into muscle
[10915.67s -> 10928.28s]  memory. There's something about that that's really fun, but we'll do a few more and then I'm going to
[10928.28s -> 10944.06s]  call it. This is really cool though. I think it's really good. Let's go back to the hub. I did that
[10944.06s -> 10953.45s]  for years because I didn't have good online. Yeah. It's fun because once you actually get a combo
[10954.01s -> 10963.78s]  and you do it in a game scenario, it's like, mom, get the camera. Okay. Let's do matchmaking,
[10963.78s -> 10979.74s]  right? How do I set it to matchmaking? Oh, character. I need to get my character. Wait, what?
[10979.74s -> 11010.41s]  What? It's on ranked. All right. Let me see if I can put something together here.
[11027.03s -> 11068.04s]  Shit. That's not good. I'm already out of juice. Damn it. This lost the CPU. Yeah. I get it,
[11068.04s -> 11110.41s]  but I don't get it. You got to get your hands to agree with your brain. Yeah. How are you guys
[11110.41s -> 11116.49s]  liking it though? How are you guys actually liking the game for street fighter seasoned veterans?
[11116.49s -> 11125.53s]  Is it good? Do you think it's a good one? It feels like it's fun to play. It's hard,
[11125.53s -> 11136.14s]  but honestly, I like it. Oh my goodness. He's just destroying me. Oh, I said a fake out.
[11143.11s -> 11165.99s]  Shit. Oh, no, I can't lose to the CPU. I was looking at chat.
[11218.70s -> 11225.96s]  It's fun. It's really fun. Maybe I'll learn it. Maybe I'll just sit on the couch and learn some
[11225.96s -> 11235.06s]  combos. You know what I mean? I don't know. It's definitely really fun to play. I like the modern
[11235.06s -> 11271.98s]  control scheme. I think it's a good addition to the game. Just learn easy combos and do those.
[11271.98s -> 11282.52s]  You don't need to do big combos yet. That's true. That's very true. Just do whatever you like doing.
[11282.52s -> 11285.72s]  Just never tell yourself that you have some artificial limit on your skill. You can be as
[11285.72s -> 11297.69s]  good as you want to be. Oh my God. The street fighter community is so nice. Are you serious?
[11300.06s -> 11309.90s]  Wow. You guys are great. Look at you guys telling me that I could learn combos and I'm doing good
[11309.90s -> 11329.35s]  and doing better. Holy smokes. Wow. All right. Thank you. You guys are great. Real ranked match
[11329.35s -> 11347.43s]  now. Vibes are immaculate. We're going to face a good DJ. I'm kind of concerned.
[11357.08s -> 11369.62s]  This is really nice. This is cool. All right. Let's go. I got punished really bad. Oh my God.
[11369.62s -> 11412.90s]  I'm already empty. Oh my goodness. I'm already empty. That was a lot of early damage. What the
[11412.90s -> 11441.61s]  fuck did we both just do? Get out of the corner. Oh, not good. Oh, I just like punched him in the
[11441.61s -> 11460.68s]  fucking balls. No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, that's bad. Oh, he got me right in the corner. Shit.
[11461.48s -> 11506.38s]  I was too scared. Oh shit. Oh my God. How many times is he going to do that move in a row?
[11514.71s -> 11537.90s]  Oh, he had so, he had so much drive. He almost got me with the drive. Let's do it again. Shit.
[11537.90s -> 11582.50s]  All right. I got to be careful. Ouch. Oh shit. Now you're in trouble. Oh my God. I'm just doing
[11582.50s -> 11597.32s]  the thing. What am I doing? I'm throwing so hard. I just kicked in the wrong direction like three
[11597.32s -> 11637.22s]  times. That was close. What happened? Oh, this is bad news. Oh, it's a bad day to be a cheesecake.
[11650.02s -> 11710.55s]  Good game. Oh no, there's one more. Oh, come on. Oh, that's bad. That's all right. Shit. I forgot
[11710.55s -> 11732.18s]  how to do the fucking super. I was hitting back YB instead of forward YB. One more. Oh, you never
[11732.18s -> 11740.57s]  even learned what the supers were for this character. That's true. That's true. How do you
[11740.57s -> 11760.34s]  do them? Forward YB is one. Down YB is two. What was the projectile? They're the same for everybody?
[11761.14s -> 11799.42s]  Really? All right. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. It's all right. It's okay. It's okay.
[11800.22s -> 11843.21s]  The supers are the same for everybody. Cool. Cool. Cool. Oh, what? He actually blocked it.
[11843.21s -> 11874.87s]  Nice job. Whoa. Oh, I just got fucking destroyed. All right, let's go. This is the one right here.
[11891.30s -> 11923.99s]  It's okay. It's all right. Oh, I'm like stunned now. Oh, shit. Nice job. God damn it. So, okay,
[11923.99s -> 11932.78s]  my two super, I have to chain it together apparently. I guess. Do I have to just press X
[11932.78s -> 11987.43s]  or something? Shit. Not good. It's based on rhythm really. Oh, it's hard to hit. But we both
[11987.43s -> 12007.77s]  have three. This is not going to end well. Oh, I got it. All right. Now he's going to do his like
[12007.77s -> 12011.05s]  right now. I'm going to flee. I'm going to be a coward. I got to play like a coward for a few
[12011.05s -> 12058.60s]  minutes. Did I jump over it? Oh no. Wait, what? I got away from it. Shit. Should have countered
[12058.60s -> 12103.19s]  with my own. Shit. Oh, damn it. No. I got outplayed. Oh my God. I just got so outplayed.
[12103.19s -> 12114.47s]  I panicked five times in a row. I had no idea what the fuck I was doing. Fuck. I got the
[12114.47s -> 12119.90s]  comeback you got in your head. You know what I need to stop doing? I have to stop pressing
[12119.90s -> 12126.33s]  left bumper as if it's punch. I keep doing it. I'm like, oh, left bumper. Yeah, that's a big
[12126.89s -> 12141.58s]  punch counters. Don't use it as offense. Go for grabs too. That's true.
[12159.42s -> 12234.15s]  Whoa. Nice. Okay. All right. Oh my goodness. I got fucking annihilated. Oh, he's trying. He's doing
[12234.15s -> 12257.48s]  something. I saw he's doing a fatality. I saw him do like down, down, down, down. This is fun. I just
[12257.48s -> 12275.45s]  got to learn. Just have to learn and I'll be good. Are we good? Are we good? No. There we go.
[12278.92s -> 12300.38s]  I main DJ. He's a blast. He seems fun. Oh my goodness.
[12325.06s -> 12438.41s]  What? Damn it. Oh, yeah. What? Oh, damn it. No. I parried it. What? No. Oh, well, that's a lot of
[12438.41s -> 12491.99s]  exes. I got to be more aggressive. Shit. Shit. Shit. No again. Oh, I can't finish the job.
[12492.79s -> 12539.37s]  Oh, that move. How do I get away from that move? Did she just take my super away? I'm going to lose.
[12540.73s -> 12553.05s]  What is she doing to me? She's taking all my shit. What the fuck? You're just panicking.
[12553.05s -> 12582.65s]  This game's too hard. Throw fireballs. How do you throw a fireball back? Why also can somebody help
[12582.65s -> 12590.49s]  me? I feel like I'm always like zero drive, even if I don't use the meter, even if I don't
[12590.49s -> 12642.12s]  use the bars. Am I doing something wrong? Do the move. What? Oh, I'm okay. Jesus. The ex moves
[12642.12s -> 12647.59s]  burn drive. Those are happening automatically though, aren't they? Because of the modern
[12648.47s -> 12685.80s]  combat system. Hmm. Oh, okay. Wake up from a knockdown. You need to block more.
[12686.44s -> 12691.27s]  That's the drawback of using modern, less controlled than meters. Hmm. That's good to know.
[12716.39s -> 12735.24s]  How do I do my free move? I couldn't do my three super. I did down and YB. It didn't do anything.
[12735.88s -> 12743.75s]  What the hell? I was hitting down YB, down YB, down YB. I'm just going to learn how to play on
[12743.75s -> 12794.47s]  classic. Oh, I had one meter. I'm an idiot. I'm looking at the bottom left. Try to mix it up.
[12797.54s -> 12826.92s]  Yeah. All right. Here we go. Oh, it didn't do anything. No, he wants to e-haunt me right now.
[12828.01s -> 12831.85s]  I know what you're going to do. I know. I know what you have. You have your triple combo thing.
[12832.65s -> 12861.37s]  I ain't fucking around. He wants to do it so bad. I know he does. No, no, that's all right. All
[12861.37s -> 12874.87s]  right. One more and I'm done. Last one. Last one. Last one. Last one. One more. Last one. You're being
[12874.87s -> 12884.79s]  more patient. Yeah. In fighting games, I just get in my own head and I go just press every button,
[12884.79s -> 12898.33s]  even if you don't need to, and just run and jump five times in a row. Okay. New character. I haven't
[12898.33s -> 12957.48s]  seen before. Oh, cool. Okay. All right. All right. All right. Good. Still, I could have lost it there.
[12957.48s -> 12959.88s]  Does that drink do something? It's not just a taunt.
[13010.23s -> 13029.98s]  Fuck. Come on. Break out of it with your thing. Do your thing. Oh, my goodness. He gets new special
[13029.98s -> 13084.26s]  moves. Oh, boy. That's not good. Hey, stop relying on the auto combos. Yeah. Well, now that I know
[13084.26s -> 13114.81s]  that it's using meter, it's using bars. I'm trying not to use it that frequently. Oh, that was weird.
[13115.37s -> 13169.40s]  Oh, not good. Use RTY more. Oh, you're using RTY too much. Okay. Oh, who did it? Oh, all right.
[13169.40s -> 13224.49s]  You got your three. I'm terrified of you. I don't know how the fucking move works. No. He's just
[13224.49s -> 13244.30s]  ducking. Oh, my God. I used it all. I used it all. How did I do that? I used that. I went to drain
[13244.30s -> 13313.10s]  it to zero. What does CA mean? Critical Art. Oh, okay. That's a good game. Nice fight. It's level
[13313.10s -> 13325.53s]  three. So I probably would have got killed by that. Damn. All right. Actually, last one. I mean it.
[13326.60s -> 13335.29s]  Last one. I appreciate all the help, though. I'm very new to this. It's really cool. Appreciate it.
[13335.85s -> 13341.32s]  You guys have been really nice to me. I was going to look over. I was scared I was going to look
[13341.32s -> 13352.68s]  over and it was like, oh, no, they hate me. All right. I rank up opportunity. All right.
[13394.87s -> 13446.95s]  All right. I tried to be really patient. Shit. Why are you still bad at this game?
[13447.59s -> 13451.59s]  This is the second time I've seen this character play. I don't even know what this guy's... I know
[13451.59s -> 13502.74s]  he drinks alcohol. You know what? Time that person up for five seconds. Holy shit. He just fucking
[13502.74s -> 13512.76s]  destroyed me. When somebody gets in a rhythm, it's just like, I don't even know what to do.
[13516.90s -> 13564.17s]  What the fuck was that? I'm trying to throw fireballs. Why did he just do that? Really?
[13574.78s -> 13591.70s]  All right. We can do it again. Shit. I don't know what's going on with him, but he seems
[13591.70s -> 13617.72s]  very angry and very drunk. It's been a lot of screaming. Sorry about that.
[13619.70s -> 13654.44s]  Okay. I got to pull together here. I did like no damage to him. Oh, my God. He hurts so much.
[13654.44s -> 13694.84s]  This guy's fucking crazy. All right. Okay. That's enough. I had fun. That was fun. All right. Last
[13694.84s -> 13712.39s]  one. Chun-Li. Okay. You're going to end on a loss. I know that's... I'm going to use this philosophy.
[13713.59s -> 13812.50s]  One of my earbuds fell out. Disaster. I was a little scared there. Oh, shit. I got caught
[13812.50s -> 13865.35s]  in the corner. All right. This last one. Shit. Shit. Okay. Well, I just got fucking annihilated.
[13865.35s -> 13894.25s]  Okay. I keep forgetting you can do the grab parry. I forget it. All right. I didn't mean to even do
[13894.25s -> 13979.24s]  that move. Fuck. Oh, okay. All right. One more. It was one and one. It was one and one. Damn it.
[13979.24s -> 13989.82s]  I still got it. Everyone's either playing Diablo or this. Well, they're two new, cool, fun video
[13989.82s -> 14000.31s]  games. I didn't mean to do that. Oh, my God. I got to stop doing that. I'm just... Oh, I fucked up
[14000.31s -> 14007.99s]  everything. If you don't know how to do the move, don't pretend to do it and spam the move
[14007.99s -> 14050.79s]  three times and then just burn all your meter. Really? Oh, I'm so screwed here. Damn it. All
[14050.79s -> 14055.59s]  right. All right. This time, don't go back wide, back wide, back wide and have no fucking squares
[14055.59s -> 14112.04s]  left, you dummy. That's bad. That's game over. Should have blocked. Yeah. All right. Last one.
[14112.68s -> 14119.11s]  All right. No matter what happens, this is the last one for... It's over. One more and that's it.
[14119.11s -> 14160.60s]  I should have ended when I won. Oh, no. Not this guy. That little head tilt at the end. Whoa.
[14162.18s -> 14175.37s]  What the hell is that? That was crazy. I can't grab this guy. How close are I going to be?
[14182.81s -> 14220.94s]  Shit. What the fuck? That did like 35% of my health. Is that just a regular grab? I missed it. Oh,
[14220.94s -> 14243.72s]  my God. Shit. Come on, dude. Oh, my God. That sucks. It's not over yet. Oh, my God.
[14245.96s -> 14255.77s]  I don't know how far it went forward. I thought it went much further than that. Shit. Damn it.
[14255.77s -> 14286.31s]  It's all right. What the hell? Oh, my God. Bad idea. I'm getting fucking dominated right now.
[14310.20s -> 14352.20s]  I didn't even throw him. What? Oh, that's not good. All right. At least it's something okay.
[14353.16s -> 14357.10s]  I'm starting to understand it. He's super good at zoning though. That's the...
[14357.26s -> 14360.30s]  I'm saying words. I don't know what they actually mean. I'm just saying them.
[14372.10s -> 14389.18s]  Oh, I try to catch it again. Bad idea. That was really stupid of me. That was really dumb of me.
[14389.18s -> 14414.36s]  I don't know why I did that. Oh, my God. He's un-fucking-bearable. He has moves that go across
[14414.36s -> 14417.80s]  the screen. He's got moves that are close. He's got things to shoot from the fucking ceiling.
[14418.44s -> 14441.11s]  All right. That one doesn't count. I got to end on a win. All right. No matter what happens,
[14441.11s -> 14454.38s]  this is the final one. I promise. I'm done after this. Everyone's clapping. Hey, thanks.
[14457.61s -> 14464.09s]  I wish you well in the world of... I almost just said StarCraft. Street Fighter.
[14471.99s -> 14474.79s]  All right. This is the one right here. I'm going to try as hard as I can. I'm going to be quiet
[14474.79s -> 14506.84s]  the whole time. Here we go. Three, two, one. Quiet. I just tried as hard as I could.
[14516.70s -> 14545.48s]  Nice. Okay. Okay. All right. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. Okay.
[14561.46s -> 14567.14s]  No. Why did that not connect? I don't understand StarCraft.
[14592.22s -> 14655.91s]  Did it. Okay. What? Stream lagging? Oh, it shouldn't be. Nice. Okay. All right.
[14656.55s -> 14687.22s]  That was a good parry. Oh, shit. I just got perfect in the corner. Shit. Oh, my God. My face is
[14687.22s -> 14711.18s]  sweating. I forgot how to play the game. I'm in trouble now. Whoa. That was laggy. So good,
[14711.18s -> 14744.98s]  though. What? Why did that get animation canceled by every fucking move in the game?
[14745.94s -> 14766.06s]  I did it. That was close. All right. That's it. That was really fun. Street Fighter 6
[14766.06s -> 14771.96s]  is great. I could see how people could dump hundreds of hours into this game.
[14772.52s -> 14785.27s]  I completely get it. That was awesome. Oh, shit. I mean, we have to do it. I'm just here.
[14785.83s -> 14790.38s]  Didn't mean to. I just, I tried to exit. You saw me hit the button.
[14800.50s -> 14804.18s]  Sorry I turned the stream off halfway through. That was really stupid of me.
[14804.26s -> 14825.43s]  It's all right, though. We had fun. I never did face cam either. We'll do it next time.
[14826.31s -> 14881.10s]  All right. This is the one here. Right here. Shit. Oh, I somehow pulled that out of my ass.
[14902.74s -> 14967.93s]  Shit. I can do that too. Oh. All right. We have to do a revenge. All right. Easy. Hold on.
[14967.93s -> 15018.42s]  Oh, that was, I blew it. Sorry. I blew it. It's fine. Shit. Oh, I fucking lost it in this last
[15018.42s -> 15034.36s]  round. Big time. Now I forgot what the controls were. All right. That's a, that's a 1v1.
[15035.08s -> 15042.81s]  That's I-1-1. That's, yeah. We gotta go for the whole thing. Gotta go for the whole thing. This
[15042.81s -> 15091.29s]  is the World Series right here. God damn it. I can't do anything. Oh my God. I'm getting
[15091.29s -> 15131.50s]  fucking screwed. All right. Aggression. Let's go. All right. That was, that was like I handed the
[15131.50s -> 15192.41s]  controller to somebody else. No. Oh, no. Shit. I just didn't know what to do for a follow-up.
[15192.41s -> 15202.30s]  I just was like, what do I do? I, what do I do? It's like, wow, I put it all together and oh,
[15202.30s -> 15211.85s]  he's just, he's lying on his back. Okay. Oh, B. All right. Last one or I'll delete my Twitch
[15211.85s -> 15222.36s]  channel. This is the last one. If this series, whatever the series ends up being, I'm playing
[15222.44s -> 15232.79s]  against this next person. Even if we rematch, that's fine. But that's it. I'm out. What the
[15232.79s -> 15246.87s]  hell? What was that? Stopped saying last one. Well, I, I was supposed to leave. It's time for
[15246.87s -> 15331.75s]  dinner. I'm only leaving because I need to eat. Let's go. You got garlic bread down? Oh, I got
[15331.75s -> 15369.83s]  garlic bread. I gotta get out of here. Okay. All right. Oh, what happens? What happens now?
[15370.79s -> 15388.06s]  What just happened? I caught him right in the chin. I don't know what happened, but that was
[15388.06s -> 15450.68s]  pretty crazy. All right. Cool. Hmm. Oh, what? I grabbed him. All right. I got, I got a lot of
[15450.68s -> 15493.72s]  meter. I'm good. All right. That's all right. That's all right. All right. That's it. That was fun.
[15493.72s -> 15504.78s]  Oh, I can see how people just delete weeks of their life to this game. I never got into,
[15504.78s -> 15511.74s]  I didn't really care for them. They were always too hard. Well, not hard. It just, it was always,
[15511.74s -> 15518.17s]  oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I gotta get out of here. Thanks for playing whoever played.
[15518.17s -> 15531.43s]  That was a lot of fun. I will see you guys in a couple of days. I'll see you on Wednesday,
[15531.99s -> 15547.54s]  Wednesday the 7th. Gollum, 4.5 out of 10. Street Fighter 6. I mean, I don't know, like nine.
[15547.54s -> 15562.15s]  This is great. I actually really liked this game. It's cool that people think that this is a good
[15562.15s -> 15575.40s]  one because I'm having fun with it. Yeah. Four o'clock on Wednesday. Yeah. I promise we'll go
[15575.48s -> 15583.06s]  over a gen lost stuff. I kind of got addicted to this game. I forgot about everything because that
[15583.06s -> 15592.31s]  was an unbelievable experience. So I definitely want to talk a little bit more about it. Yeah.
[15592.31s -> 15595.75s]  I'll see you guys on Wednesday. Take care of yourselves. Why is my voice gone? Have I just
[15595.75s -> 15610.95s]  been yelling? Oh, every time I get KO'd, I went, Oh, right. I forgot. Thanks for watching. See you
[15610.95s -> 15627.93s]  later. See you soon. Let's actually, let me quit this correctly. That's Street Fighter 6. Yeah.
[15627.93s -> 15645.05s]  I'm sweating. Sweaty game. See you soon. Thanks for watching. How do you exit the game?
[15645.77s -> 15657.06s]  I don't know how to leave. Where's the quit game button? How do you leave? I don't know how to leave.
[15661.59s -> 15670.73s]  Menu. Exit two. Okay. You have to press. Okay. Exit desktop. There it is. All right. Call your
[15670.73s -> 15679.37s]  mother. See you later. Otto's doing better. You don't know Otto had a bladder infection. He still
[15679.37s -> 15686.78s]  does. And yesterday I wanted to make sure that we monitored him. I can't even talk right now.
[15687.02s -> 15695.30s]  That we monitored him because he had to go outside every 45 minutes or so. He's drinking
[15695.30s -> 15707.13s]  a lot of water, but he's on antibiotics. Seems to be doing much better. He's good. Yep. Wednesday
[15707.13s -> 15715.45s]  is the next stream day. I might play more Street Fighter. Would you guys like it if I actually
[15715.45s -> 15729.72s]  learned the game and actually learned how to play more and play it some more? I had a lot of fun.
[15729.72s -> 15736.25s]  Yeah. Just jumping off for like a couple of, I'm going to learn some more combos.
[15737.13s -> 15743.29s]  I might play with some other characters too. Get better. Take more creative characters. Yeah.
[15749.32s -> 15757.11s]  Thanks for being so, I said this earlier, but that was, it was like no toxic chat members.
[15757.11s -> 15771.62s]  It's unbelievable. I don't think I've ever seen that before. No, they were. They were. Somebody
[15771.62s -> 15788.65s]  said there were plenty. I just wasn't looking at the right time. That's funny. They really were.
[15789.45s -> 15803.30s]  It's okay. I don't, it doesn't bother me. I don't feel pressured. No, I, I really, look, I know what
[15803.30s -> 15811.99s]  I'm capable of doing. Fighting games are usually not one of them, but you can call me, you can call me
[15811.99s -> 15818.07s]  a shitty player. That's fine. It's your opinion. You're allowed to have it. You can call me a,
[15818.07s -> 15825.30s]  you can call me a modern Andy and then say that I fucking smell and that I'm bad at this game.
[15827.14s -> 15832.22s]  But if you do that, you, you're going to get zapped. Just telling you.
[15834.70s -> 15853.34s]  The fighting game community loves you. Really? Thanks guys. They didn't know that. Well, you
[15853.34s -> 15856.14s]  can't, that's a, that's a very big blanket statement. I'm sure there's plenty of people
[15856.14s -> 15863.86s]  that don't like me, but I appreciate it nonetheless. All right. Good night guys.
[15863.86s -> 15880.22s]  See you later. Call your mother. Goodbye. See you Wednesday. See you later.
