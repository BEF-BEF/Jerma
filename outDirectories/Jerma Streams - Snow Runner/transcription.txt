[2.68s -> 11.45s]  Yeah, you can just call me on time, Andy. How's my mic? Sound bad? I'm playing around with
[11.45s -> 20.92s]  settings. I think it sounds fine. That's good. All right. Hello, everybody. How are you? Let me
[20.92s -> 41.08s]  tweet. Let me tweet first. Tweet has been out. Very good. Thought you were playing hard time.
[41.08s -> 50.38s]  Yeah, I was. I was until I wasn't. So here's why I'm not playing hard time. M Dickie has
[51.88s -> 61.83s]  two or three iPad, Android exclusive mobile games. So I'm like, there's a superhero one.
[61.83s -> 67.72s]  There's one where you pick a superhero and it's M Dickie superhero world. So I was like, you know
[67.72s -> 77.78s]  what? Why don't we just like do it a day where I just play all the M Dickie iPad games? And then
[77.78s -> 81.78s]  I was told that there's like three versions of hard time and like one of them is the one to play
[81.78s -> 86.81s]  or something. So I was like, you know what? Let me I'll figure that out. In the meantime,
[87.75s -> 97.88s]  this is a highly requested game. Diablo two waiting room. You've got you've got like a month
[97.88s -> 107.53s]  to wait for that. And I'm not going to stream Diablo two. I don't even know if I'm going to play
[107.53s -> 117.19s]  Diablo two. Like I don't you know what I mean? Like I have no idea. When's the next Sims stream?
[118.58s -> 124.66s]  Well, I have all the mods. I just didn't want it to be like dollhouse Sims three. I'm the Sims guy.
[124.66s -> 129.83s]  Come on back from the dollhouse and check out the Sims three. So like, you know what? Well,
[129.83s -> 139.58s]  I have a bunch of fucked up mods. We'll play with it some other time. Maybe like next week
[139.58s -> 145.93s]  or something. So here's how this is going to go. Okay. Today, we're going to play snow runner.
[146.49s -> 152.73s]  And I heard it's quite a rage game. You better be ready for that one. You drive around in big
[152.73s -> 161.69s]  trucks and have to deliver stuff. And you have to be careful. The meltdown. I don't know if I don't
[161.69s -> 166.18s]  it's not possible for a meltdown. I don't have the brain power to do a meltdown right now.
[167.46s -> 174.23s]  No way. Even if I wanted to get really angry, it would just hit a wall and I'd be like, what the
[175.03s -> 180.28s]  fuck? I'm just like, so I'm still kind of coming down from the dollhouse. Even though it was like
[180.28s -> 186.23s]  a week ago, I'm coming off like the high of the dollhouse week. So I figured we'll just
[186.23s -> 192.71s]  chill today. No more heroes. Three is out too, by the way. So we're going to do that this coming
[192.71s -> 202.68s]  weekend. I heard it's long too. No more heroes. Three is like 17, 15, 16 hours long. The first
[202.68s -> 215.98s]  two were like 11 hours, 10 hours. It's a longer game. This game is going to lay waste to your
[215.98s -> 228.20s]  attention span. Is it? Is it a hard game? LOL. Do you do drugs? I mean, if you count a seed of
[228.20s -> 244.84s]  medicine, ibuprofen sometimes. No, I'm not high right now. I'm not. Although I've told you this
[244.84s -> 251.99s]  before, but it is a great excuse. Anytime I do something stupid. Ah, it's, it's because he's
[251.99s -> 259.59s]  high today. Yep. Yeah, sure. That's why I can't add six and four in less than 10 seconds. Yeah,
[259.59s -> 263.67s]  I can't do eight plus seven because I just got high today. You know, you guys are right.
[265.53s -> 271.42s]  So it's a great thing to fall back on for sure. All right, let's go. Did I tweet this? Yeah.
[275.13s -> 281.27s]  Welcome back. We're going back to normal. We're kind of closing the book on the last week of
[281.27s -> 289.35s]  insanity onto the next one. There's already plans on the next two larger streams. I'm very excited
[289.99s -> 293.40s]  and we're just going to do them. If they're fun, then I'm going to try to do them.
[295.35s -> 299.43s]  There will be more details on those soon. And also I want to make this clear. Grotto beasts
[300.70s -> 309.62s]  is not just gone. Grotto beast is here. It'll be here. You'll be able to buy it before the end
[309.62s -> 313.83s]  of the year. We're really hoping that somewhere on Christmas time, like the November, December
[315.16s -> 321.22s]  space, I want you guys to be able to get your hands on those. And now that all the dollhouse
[321.22s -> 326.18s]  stuff is done, the months of that, all that work, we're going to focus on some of the smaller
[326.18s -> 333.06s]  projects that aren't huge, gigantic streams and Grotto beast and the German craft server are the
[333.06s -> 338.68s]  next kind of coming up in line. So let's play snow runner. Let's just do it. I came on. I hope
[338.68s -> 352.12s]  not. When is baseball? Baseball is going to be, hopefully if it's not by the end of October of
[352.12s -> 359.11s]  this year, just whether you can't really play baseball like November, December, it's just not
[359.11s -> 364.98s]  possible. Let's go to like a dome, but I don't think we're going to go to a dome. If it's not
[364.98s -> 369.77s]  October, end of October this year, then that's the first thing that'll happen around like the
[369.77s -> 382.04s]  spring training time, February, March, hopefully of 2022. What is baseball though? Something that
[382.04s -> 388.22s]  I've wanted to do for over a year that was ready to go a year ago and COVID fucked the whole thing
[388.22s -> 394.97s]  up. So it's just done and it's ready, but I can't do it. Well, it's not done, but you know what I
[394.97s -> 401.83s]  mean? All right, snow runner. Am I going to, am I going to fucking hate this game? I don't know.
[401.83s -> 408.71s]  We're going to find out. Let me turn it up. I'm not going to play it on hard mode. By the way,
[408.71s -> 415.40s]  I got a 30 90. So, uh, this should look really good. Like only the second or third game I played
[415.40s -> 427.06s]  on this 30 90. All right, let's go. New campaign plot one. This guy's rich. He has a 30 90. No,
[427.06s -> 432.30s]  this guy's got a 30 90. Cause he had to pay like a hundred percent ultra premium to make a new
[432.30s -> 437.51s]  computer. Don't think that like, Oh wow. That's cool. No, I got like scammed. Cause I bought like
[438.23s -> 444.34s]  50 fucking percent over market price. Like that's not cool. Like that's, that's stupid. I did a dumb,
[444.34s -> 450.33s]  stupid idiot thing. Thank you for joining our recovery and maintenance effort after the
[450.33s -> 456.09s]  devastating flood. We need all help available to repair the bridge that collapsed. It's our only
[456.09s -> 465.58s]  link to the other side of the river. Disposable income, Andy. Stop it. Hey, there's a lot of new
[465.58s -> 473.05s]  people here. Okay. We got to like, I'm Jerma and I'm cool. First need to find a watch tower to get
[473.05s -> 479.62s]  a view of your surroundings. All right. I need to find a watch tower and you'll have to find a truck
[479.62s -> 485.56s]  capable of transport. Is this like a, do I walk around as a human? You have to find a truck capable
[485.56s -> 489.64s]  of transporting the materials need to repair the bridge. After the bridge is repaired, you will be
[489.64s -> 499.75s]  able to reach your first garage. Find a watch tower, find a truck. I was going to say, what the
[499.75s -> 505.21s]  hell is that? Oh shit. Plus one letter grade automatically. All right. Remove handbrake.
[505.21s -> 514.04s]  Start engine. Your first move should always be to scout new areas. Open the map. Your tracked
[514.04s -> 522.86s]  objective always shows up here. Let's go find that watch tower. Uh, okay. Is there a straight line?
[522.86s -> 530.94s]  It's already an F. You can't give a game an F before I've even hit the accelerate button. Okay.
[534.31s -> 542.57s]  We're in Michigan, Alaska, Tamir, Kola Peninsula, and Yukon. All right. So these are different
[542.57s -> 551.99s]  areas. So we're in the flooded foothills. Big Salmon Peak. All right. Whatever. Except that
[551.99s -> 560.42s]  we're in the flooded foothills, right? Oh shit. All right. So here's a watch tower right here.
[560.42s -> 567.99s]  All right. So can I just put a waypoint on it? Did you pirate the game? This game is on Steam.
[567.99s -> 574.42s]  What do you mean did I pirate the game? This game is available on Steam. I got it on Steam.
[574.74s -> 582.04s]  I wouldn't even pirate the game. Okay. In order to access this region, find a garage. Why can I
[582.04s -> 586.87s]  keep thinking of like the English way to say that word? A garage. A garage, right? I don't know why
[586.87s -> 594.63s]  I keep it just to say garage. Don't do like the English way. Please travel to Alaska. No. All
[594.63s -> 608.07s]  right. Well, what do I do? All right. Find a watch tower. How do I drive? Oh, why would the handbrake
[608.07s -> 622.09s]  be on? All right. Hold on. I got too much of mud. I wouldn't want to drive through this. When driving
[622.09s -> 626.33s]  on rough terrain, you can switch to low gear. It'll slow you down, but will lower the risk of
[626.33s -> 633.88s]  getting stuck. Okay. So low gear. It makes me, I won't get stuck. LB and press R to the left to
[633.88s -> 644.31s]  activate. All right. Low gear. I won't get stuck in the mud. I already lost. No, I didn't lose.
[645.11s -> 654.22s]  Your truck is all wheel drive capable. The AWD will also help in tough terrain, but will increase
[654.22s -> 659.96s]  your fuel consumption. Oh, should I have fuel? Hold LB and X to activate all wheel drive.
[661.05s -> 667.75s]  I don't need it right now. You should get off low gear when you're on a normal terrain.
[668.31s -> 677.40s]  This is not normal terrain. All right. All wheel drive. Let's go. Oh, there's just a guy in here.
[678.81s -> 687.69s]  I like that. Plus 0.5 letter grade. How is this normal terrain? It's not. All right. Turn off
[687.69s -> 698.22s]  all wheel drive. This only happens in the pirated version. I bought this game. I own this game.
[702.42s -> 709.37s]  Okay. Old people will be driving circles around you. It's raining in the mud. You guys have no,
[709.37s -> 717.38s]  you just don't know anything about like all wheel drive or anything. Guess what? I don't know
[717.38s -> 726.78s]  anything about all wheel drive either. I drive a Honda Civic. All right. Should I take off the,
[726.78s -> 733.51s]  let's take this off. How do I change that again? How do I change the gear? I want to go back to
[733.51s -> 746.41s]  normal gear. Let's hold LB and there it is. Okay. A, auto. Wait, no. How do I? No, that's
[746.41s -> 754.17s]  all right. Yeah, that's fine. Oh shit. No, stay in low. Oops. All right. I got to go all wheel
[754.17s -> 759.56s]  drive. If you're stuck, you can try using your winch and see if there's anything around that
[759.56s -> 766.10s]  you can attach it to. Activate the functions menu with up to use your winch. I'm not stuck.
[766.90s -> 776.97s]  All right. How do I do all wheel drive again? All wheel drive. How do I do all wheel drive?
[777.61s -> 782.89s]  It was right bumper and something else, right? What was it? An X, right? Okay. There it is. Let's
[782.89s -> 792.84s]  go. I'm not stuck. Fuck out of here. Why am I just driving the grass? Why am I driving on the road?
[793.40s -> 806.04s]  This thing is so dirty. This is too low of a truck. You're going to get stuck. I'm fine. I think I
[806.04s -> 816.02s]  would be fine. I would never do this drive. All right. Turn off all wheel drive. Good.
[816.58s -> 825.69s]  Here we go. There's a road right here. Take it off low. There's no need. All right. Well, I'm
[825.69s -> 828.73s]  about, I'm about, here's a road right here. All right. Find a watch tower. All right. We're back
[828.73s -> 838.78s]  on. We're on the road. What's nitro? All right. This drives way, way different than I thought it
[838.78s -> 843.74s]  was going to be on the road. Sit the brakes. All right. Hold on. Can you die? Okay. I don't
[843.74s -> 848.15s]  get you die in this game. All right. There's a, what should I go left? Should I go right?
[848.87s -> 862.20s]  No, fuck that. We're going on the road. How do I activate the rockets? Did I put in an all wheel
[862.20s -> 866.12s]  drive and just fucking hit the gas as hard as I can? Oh, I've been playing for like 10 minutes.
[866.84s -> 883.45s]  All right. I'll do it one time. You will encounter different kinds of terrains such as road, dirt,
[883.53s -> 890.95s]  mud, deep mud, water, rocky slides, snow and ice. Only the most experienced drivers with well-equipped
[890.95s -> 895.75s]  vehicles can drive on any kind of terrain. When in doubt, there's no shame in avoiding danger.
[896.63s -> 900.39s]  You can find out more about the different types of terrain in the codex. All right. So
[901.35s -> 918.47s]  can I just drive through this? Can I, can I drive through this? Yeah. All right. Well,
[918.47s -> 929.26s]  I'll just do this way. How high is this water? Is the water too high? All right. Should I put
[929.26s -> 933.10s]  in an all wheel drive? I don't know what to do. What are you supposed to do in this scenario?
[933.10s -> 937.02s]  All right. I'm going to drive as fast as I can over this. I'm going all wheel drive. I'm putting
[937.02s -> 948.97s]  on the boosters and I'm just going to hit the gas. All right. Let's go. I've played the Oregon trail.
[948.97s -> 963.83s]  I'll make it. It's okay. Jerry got typhoid fever. Who cares? He was dying anyways.
[965.26s -> 974.81s]  You can refuel here or near any vehicle that may. Okay. So how much gas? How much money do I have?
[977.40s -> 986.31s]  If I drive into these things, they explode. If I drive into them, fuel three gallons. Okay. How
[986.31s -> 995.27s]  much does that cost? Find out. No, but there's like, I don't want to, what is, how's the game
[995.27s -> 1003.34s]  saved? How do I change that camera angle? I don't want to use the winch. Your winch should be
[1003.34s -> 1007.90s]  connected to a solid object. It's like the winch point on your vehicle and which point to an object
[1007.90s -> 1032.34s]  in your surroundings. Wait, what? Okay. Um, hold on. All right. Attach winch here and then select
[1032.34s -> 1044.04s]  the winch point. Oh, wait, what does it attach to? No, I wanted to attach it. I want to put the winch
[1044.04s -> 1055.69s]  over here. Show damage. Oh, I'm fine. I got to pull everything. Can I attach it to this? All right.
[1055.69s -> 1065.58s]  Attach winch. Put it on the back and select the point. Oh, I see. Okay. You can't do it.
[1066.14s -> 1071.83s]  Well, let's just, okay. First, why to pull your winch? Try using your own engine power to pull
[1071.83s -> 1096.46s]  yourself. What if I just drive away? No, I'm trying to rip the fucking sign down. All right. Well,
[1096.46s -> 1109.96s]  I can't do that. Honk? How do you honk? Okay. All right. I tried to do it. I'm just going to drive.
[1111.00s -> 1113.96s]  Open the function window to get more details about damaged parts. What did I just do?
[1114.76s -> 1127.34s]  What's my damage? Oh, put the winch down. Delete trailer. Stop engine. Recover. How do I see the
[1127.34s -> 1143.56s]  damage? All right. Well, fucking whatever. I'm fine. Let's go. Where's the tower? Wait, hold on.
[1146.68s -> 1156.04s]  I have the map, right? Oh, fuck yeah. Let's just drive through the trees. This is an off-road game.
[1156.04s -> 1166.82s]  You're not supposed to play by the rules. It's an all-wheel drive. Just fucking drive through the
[1166.82s -> 1181.96s]  trees. I've done this in GTA a thousand times. Watch it. Note that watchtower ahead. Such icons
[1181.96s -> 1187.90s]  will help you detect objective zones nearby. There we go. Look at that. That was simple.
[1188.62s -> 1193.51s]  I did it. Good job. You discovered your first watchtower. Discovering watchtowers will reveal
[1193.51s -> 1198.22s]  parts of the map. To repair the bridge, you need a bigger vehicle to transport materials.
[1198.86s -> 1205.80s]  Okay. Open your map. Look at your surroundings. Find a truck capable of transporting the materials
[1205.80s -> 1211.56s]  needed. Okay. So I got to find a truck, a big truck, capable of transporting shit. All right.
[1212.12s -> 1224.07s]  It's just Ubisoft. Yeah, it is. Even the menu looks like Ubisoft. This is way more elaborate
[1224.07s -> 1227.83s]  than I thought it was going to be. By the way, I thought those were guns on the left side.
[1228.39s -> 1233.61s]  Discovering watchtowers will reveal part of the map. The fog covers essential points of interest
[1233.61s -> 1239.29s]  like objectives, upgrades, and vehicles. By pressing right trigger, you can place markers
[1239.29s -> 1243.45s]  on your map to help you navigate. You can delete the last marker with left trigger or clear your
[1243.45s -> 1248.76s]  route by holding left trigger. Plan a route now. Well, we're going to go to the truck, right?
[1251.02s -> 1257.98s]  Acecam? Nah, maybe if you're good. Maybe if you're good. All right. Let's do a route.
[1257.98s -> 1265.72s]  There's a lumber mill. What's over here? Sideboard trailer. And there's a truck.
[1265.72s -> 1273.05s]  Let's go get the truck. It just drives straight line. It's not even helping me.
[1273.05s -> 1285.50s]  Okay. Well, whatever. I'm going that way. How close can I get? Is there a first person camera?
[1285.50s -> 1312.89s]  Is there a save game? What if this hurts? What happened? Am I already stuck? Do I feel rage yet?
[1312.89s -> 1329.16s]  Not really. All right. Get in an all-wheel drive. Let's go. I don't want the camera. The camera's
[1329.16s -> 1339.83s]  moving on in far, big, terrible places. Here we go. I'm good. That's deep mud, but I'm fine.
[1343.99s -> 1352.34s]  I got to turn off like the smart camera or whatever the hell this is. You're actually
[1352.34s -> 1357.22s]  pretty good at this game. Well, I mean, it's the first level. Just wait till I get the
[1357.22s -> 1365.06s]  Mack truck. All right. Now let's turn this way and just drive straight. Perfect. I don't need a
[1365.06s -> 1377.67s]  route. I have plenty of gas too. I'm an all-wheel drive. All right. Get off this. Let's go. Don't
[1377.67s -> 1389.30s]  crash into any trees. I'll be fine. Vehicle damage. What? You may repair your vehicle in the garage
[1389.30s -> 1394.98s]  or use special service add-ons and trailers. Find details about the- What? You found your first
[1394.98s -> 1399.62s]  highway truck. This truck is designed for roads, so there are no off-road options included.
[1400.57s -> 1411.70s]  Try not to fall into the swamp or drive into deep mud. Fall into the swamp? How would I fall into
[1411.70s -> 1417.64s]  the swamp if I'm just driving on the road? Okay. You can find out more about the different type
[1417.64s -> 1434.50s]  of trucks in this codex. All right. Well, let's get it. What's going on? Am I hitting this picnic
[1434.50s -> 1448.90s]  table? Oh shit. I'm like buried in here. All right. Turn on all wheel drive. Slowly try to get out of
[1448.90s -> 1455.22s]  this mud. Mud actually breaks apart physics underneath you. That's crazy. Why can I not go
[1455.22s -> 1465.06s]  through this? I'm just digging myself a hole. Where'd it go? I can't reverse. Why can I not
[1465.06s -> 1483.91s]  reverse? Can I get out of the car? Okay. I'm going to have to tow it. Okay. Winch. Let's attach the
[1483.91s -> 1494.97s]  front to this truck here. All right. Let's go. Nice. Yes. All right. I'm good. Take it off.
[1496.50s -> 1500.74s]  How would I still be stuck right here? This is stupid. Don't hit the explosive barrel.
[1502.20s -> 1509.08s]  I don't want to fuck that up. All right. Well, come on. Just drive.
[1509.88s -> 1520.63s]  All right. All right. I got it. I got it. I got it. Now what?
[1523.78s -> 1529.06s]  That was just the that was just the every commercial break of return for pawn stars.
[1530.52s -> 1536.68s]  I don't know what you're saying, Chumlee. No, no, no, no, no. I don't think any of you idiots know
[1536.68s -> 1542.73s]  what you're doing in here. Pops. Pops. We got this new thing. I don't care about that shit. Get that
[1542.73s -> 1557.26s]  out of my store. Fucking idiot. Change the truck. All right. Well, how do I get in it? That was just
[1557.26s -> 1567.42s]  Mitch McConnell. All right. How about a change truck? Oh shit. All right. Wait. I can't. Can I
[1567.42s -> 1572.73s]  save that truck somewhere? I don't want to drive this thing. Didn't they just say that this thing
[1572.73s -> 1581.64s]  doesn't do off-road? All right. I need a new destination. Lumber mill. What's my what is my
[1581.64s -> 1589.67s]  actual goal? Old bridge reconstruction. Okay. I need to deliver two wooden planks. So we're
[1589.67s -> 1598.28s]  going to get this one to the lumber mill. It does off-road if you push it down and hit the gas hard
[1598.28s -> 1610.52s]  enough while screaming. All right. I need metal beams and wooden plier. Let's do the wood. Let's
[1610.52s -> 1616.90s]  get the wooden planks. It's definitely here. To complete this contract, you need to do two
[1616.90s -> 1624.31s]  objectives. They must be done in order. What? What are you talking about? They'd be done in order.
[1624.95s -> 1633.46s]  The one in the town is the storage facility. This is storage. Will you be able to pick up the
[1633.46s -> 1638.18s]  required cargo? The marker near the broken bridge indicates the delivery location. Let's go check
[1638.18s -> 1644.41s]  out the town storage. What do you mean go to the fucking town storage? I don't want to go to the
[1644.41s -> 1652.60s]  town storage. I want to go to the lumber mill because that's where the wood is. Okay. We're
[1652.60s -> 1664.39s]  going to go here. You have to do it in order. That's I don't like that. Let's go. I have to repair the
[1664.39s -> 1688.92s]  bridge. This truck is able to transport two slots of cargo. All right. Wait, this is much closer
[1688.92s -> 1696.23s]  than I thought it was. Can I just get it? I don't why do I have to do it in order? I shouldn't have
[1696.23s -> 1701.19s]  to do it in order. I'm not doing it in order. It's right here. Do the first do it in order.
[1701.19s -> 1705.77s]  Well, I don't want to do it in order. It's right here. This lumber is literally five
[1705.77s -> 1728.20s]  millimeters away from me. Wait, why is it? This thing is too big. All right. I'll go this way.
[1730.17s -> 1737.37s]  But the order. But the order. I'm going. All right. How much gas do I have? All right. Get this shit
[1737.37s -> 1753.83s]  in all wheel drive. Wait, there's no all wheel drive. There isn't? This is so scary. It's got,
[1753.83s -> 1765.51s]  it already has all wheel drive, doesn't it? All right. Slow down. Don't be an idiot.
[1769.45s -> 1773.69s]  It is safe. All right. Auto saves. That's good. All right. Metal beams and then two pieces of wood.
[1774.41s -> 1782.74s]  This guy loves yard work and big trucks. I do. It's all right. I can run over some stuff in this
[1782.74s -> 1806.71s]  like PUBG neighborhood. I'll be fine. Easy. Hey, look, they put like hazards. Oh no. I thought
[1806.71s -> 1819.62s]  that was a hole. Oh wait. Look at this. Can I drive this car? Can I change truck? Oh, come on.
[1819.62s -> 1834.36s]  I can't drive this. I can't drive the SUV. Why not? Everyone is dead. No, I think I don't know.
[1835.16s -> 1842.36s]  All right. I need to put in two pieces of metal. Cargo management. There are a couple of ways to
[1842.36s -> 1847.00s]  load a selected cargo. Automatic loading provides a simple and fast way of loading without the use
[1847.00s -> 1855.51s]  of a crane. All right. Easy. That's good. All right. So how many metal beams? Load it up.
[1856.23s -> 1862.28s]  Not enough space. All right. Well, I have enough. Cool. All right. So now I'm going to bring this.
[1862.28s -> 1876.55s]  Where am I bringing this? I have to bring this to the bridge. Where's the bridge? Fuel station
[1876.55s -> 1891.72s]  lumber mill. Would they go here? I have to bring it here. All right. Get this off. It's on the map.
[1893.24s -> 1900.63s]  Oh, shit. Okay. It's this one. That's so far away. Holy shit. That's so far away. Okay. Well,
[1900.63s -> 1914.57s]  whatever. All right. I'm bringing it to the bridge. Just drive on the highway. You may attach trailers
[1914.57s -> 1919.37s]  found out in the wilds and use them to your liking. Trailer attachments done. Wait a minute.
[1919.37s -> 1926.97s]  You may be unable to attach a variety of trailers just for a reason between distance, angle. Okay.
[1926.97s -> 1934.68s]  Wait a minute. So hold on. Should I get the trailer and go get the wood? Oh, shit. All right. Yeah.
[1934.68s -> 1947.19s]  That sounds like a good idea. All right. Where's the trailer? There it is. I need a gas station
[1947.19s -> 1958.50s]  too. What's already in here? All right. I got a new trailer. How am I going to put this on?
[1959.22s -> 1968.90s]  Can I pull it? Okay. I need to like get this. I need to move this. I'm going to try to move it.
[1980.02s -> 1985.48s]  Good. I actually wanted to dump it anyways. All right. So how do I, how do I take care of,
[1985.48s -> 2005.72s]  hold on. I need to flip it. I think I may have fucked this up bad. Come on. Pull it up. I need
[2005.72s -> 2019.88s]  to get it up on its legs. All right. Here we go. How do I get it up? Okay. So now I'm going to
[2019.88s -> 2039.72s]  attach the trailer. Attach trailer. Attach trailer. I can't. Okay. Attach trailer. No suitable
[2039.72s -> 2050.52s]  trailer. Can I like flip this? I have to flip it. I have to flip it. I have to go back on it.
[2050.52s -> 2057.72s]  I have to flip it. Got it. All right. Good, good, good. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[2057.72s -> 2082.01s]  God damn it. I'm going to run a gas doing this. I actually flipped it. Attach to here. Let's go.
[2082.01s -> 2087.58s]  Flip it. Oh, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop,
[2087.58s -> 2095.19s]  stop. I'm good. I got it. I now attach this damn thing. See, we're fine. Everyone relax.
[2096.71s -> 2104.74s]  Trailer attached. Go. Although, wait, this is going to be hard to do.
[2107.51s -> 2113.26s]  All right. I need, I need to get, should I get gas? I mean, what the hell am I doing? I'm going
[2113.26s -> 2120.07s]  to get lumber. All right. Now we're going to go to the lumber yard. Turn this off. This game's pretty
[2120.07s -> 2130.79s]  cool. I like this. This is fun. All right. Let's go get the lumber over here. This is fun. Well,
[2130.79s -> 2142.26s]  I have to drive slow though, because I, I, I, it's pulling me in both directions. All right. Slow.
[2142.90s -> 2149.59s]  I got a big load here. You know, every time I ever saw somebody at an intersection, like a big truck,
[2149.59s -> 2155.13s]  take these turns, I always imagine like, oh, it's like, it's a red light or they have like a left
[2155.13s -> 2160.22s]  arrow and here they are taking the turn. I always feel like the person in that car is just like
[2160.22s -> 2183.08s]  pursing their lips going like, fuck, fuck, like screaming every time. And it doesn't, it always
[2183.08s -> 2190.44s]  kind of feel like that they're about to hit you too. Like I just, the truck just comes all the way
[2190.44s -> 2194.84s]  across. You're sitting there at the light and it just goes across your car. You're like, holy shit,
[2194.84s -> 2212.06s]  how can you do this? How is it possible that you can even, how? I'm almost at 700,000 followers.
[2213.45s -> 2221.10s]  Holy shit. That's way more than I had like a month ago. Hey, thanks for the follows. Really
[2221.10s -> 2231.86s]  appreciate it. Thanks for joining the stream. Yeah, you, I'm talking to you. Thank you. All right.
[2231.86s -> 2242.26s]  Let's fill this up. I need two pieces of lumber. All right. Let's go. Wooden planks. I need two out
[2242.26s -> 2250.70s]  of two. Put them into the trailer. Load it up. One, two. All right. I'm good. I have a, this is
[2250.70s -> 2258.02s]  really heavy now though. This could be a disaster. Um, all right. Hold on. Now look at this. I got a
[2258.02s -> 2262.33s]  road right here. It's just a straightaway right here. Don't do anything stupid. Don't be like,
[2262.33s -> 2271.94s]  oh, look at this. And it's driving to the water. I know you want to. No, it says go that way.
[2272.66s -> 2277.16s]  I'm not driving in the fucking water. I didn't know. No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[2277.16s -> 2282.82s]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. I'm not going to fuck this up. We're going to do this the
[2282.82s -> 2296.52s]  right way. See? Okay. That's not the right. That's not what I was doing, but okay. All right. Pull
[2296.52s -> 2311.58s]  this back. I got to give myself a route. No, clear it. Clear. All right. No, this way. I'll get the,
[2311.58s -> 2316.23s]  I'll get the gist of it when I get here or whatever. Okay. There's the route. Let's do it.
[2316.23s -> 2336.89s]  When are you going to show us your disfigured face? How about now? All right. I'll give you a
[2336.89s -> 2353.40s]  face cam for this part. That's it. No, I don't do face cam unless I have to. All right. Here we go.
[2355.67s -> 2364.81s]  Am I well lit? I can't, I don't know. I can't even tell. Ew. Hold on. I got to get, I got to
[2364.81s -> 2381.86s]  get some like blood flow to my like eyes and cheeks. Okay. Okay. Be careful. See, this is why
[2381.86s -> 2385.51s]  I can't do face cam because I'm just like, what do I look like right now? What do I look like right
[2385.51s -> 2390.28s]  now? Oh, I have to play a game. What do I look like right now? No, I hate it. I don't, this
[2390.28s -> 2412.68s]  distracts me. Oh shit. Okay. Hold on. I got, I think I have enough gas to do this first mission.
[2417.02s -> 2427.86s]  Don't go too fast. I'm going to like flip this thing. Is that water? No. Can this stuff fall out
[2427.86s -> 2438.71s]  or is it attached? It looks like it's attached by the bungees or something. Stop looking. I got to
[2438.71s -> 2452.57s]  stop looking over here. Game just crashed. No, we're good. Okay. If you and I were in a fight,
[2453.80s -> 2459.27s]  like I pull out a knife and you pull out like a sword and we're like about to fight to the death.
[2460.07s -> 2465.43s]  Put the weapon down. Put it down. Just hold a mirror up. Like over here. Just hold up a mirror
[2466.23s -> 2468.87s]  and like you could, you could have like a fist or a knife in the other hand, whatever you want.
[2469.75s -> 2473.51s]  As long as there's a mirror here and we're like jumping around and dancing around, I'm going to
[2473.51s -> 2481.19s]  be like, ah, like, like fighting. What does it, what does it mean in the mirror? That's what it
[2481.19s -> 2491.08s]  looked like. That's how, that's my weakness. You'll win every single time. Uh, wait a minute. I
[2491.08s -> 2502.06s]  don't know about this part. Can you tell how deep the water is? Why does it say I have zero out of
[2502.06s -> 2516.15s]  one metal beams? Should I just go for it? All right. I'm just going to go for it. You just cover
[2516.15s -> 2521.03s]  a room with mirrors. I will forget that I was fighting you and I'll start like punching myself
[2521.03s -> 2544.74s]  in the mirror. We're good. Attach a trailer. You should approach it. Let me attach a trailer.
[2545.38s -> 2558.23s]  Is there another one? Is there, is it, wait, is there another trailer here? No. Why would they
[2558.23s -> 2575.80s]  show me that? I'm not putting, I'm not making a choo-choo train. Not right now. Turn the hints
[2575.80s -> 2583.64s]  off. Well, I might, I might need them. All right. This looks like this is getting narrow. Hold on.
[2583.64s -> 2595.62s]  I got to focus. My game seems like crashing. Oh, 30, 90, 30, 90. All right. Now we're getting a
[2595.62s -> 2621.43s]  left here, right? Come on. You can make it. It's getting to be nighttime. You see that? I was just
[2621.43s -> 2626.47s]  taking a left. I was just taking a left at the intersection. That's what they do. They're like,
[2628.07s -> 2636.70s]  oh shit. Fuck. What do I do? How do I get out of this? It's this, it's this goddamn
[2636.70s -> 2643.58s]  mirror. I don't want the mirror anymore. It's the mirror. Can I attach it? Just wait, hold on.
[2643.58s -> 2673.53s]  Recover vehicle to start zone. What? Can I push? Cargo will be lost. Oh, come on. No.
[2676.50s -> 2685.67s]  You can't blame everything on drugs and mirrors. Okay. Well, I'm going to,
[2686.31s -> 2694.20s]  what if I just quit the game? Oh, let me attach the trailer. Trailer's too far away. God damn it.
[2694.20s -> 2703.99s]  I have to do the whole thing again. Pain's truck. Fuck. How? Whatever. Recover vehicle.
[2705.72s -> 2718.66s]  Why did I detach the thing? Why? Use the winch? I can't use the winch. It broke. What has the
[2718.66s -> 2729.37s]  most damage? This thing is fine. I just need to flip it. Can I like flip it somehow? No,
[2729.37s -> 2734.57s]  I'm just going to reload. Truck recovery. Go on. Whatever. Okay. Great. This is fantastic.
[2736.30s -> 2747.19s]  Oh my God. I have to do the whole thing again. All right. No, don't fuck this up this time.
[2747.19s -> 2754.26s]  Doesn't matter. I don't have to do it in order. Let's go. All right. I'm doing this quick.
[2754.26s -> 2759.56s]  Fuck. Okay. Get the, go get the attached trailer. Put the lumber in the trailer.
[2760.12s -> 2768.70s]  Head this way. Go that way. I'm going to make, no, do it right. Do it right. Fucking mirrors. I
[2768.70s -> 2775.19s]  swear to God. All right. I'm going to go here. We're going to clear all things. Here. I'm going
[2775.19s -> 2782.36s]  to get the trailer and then I'm going to get the lumber. We're then going to go this way.
[2782.36s -> 2792.49s]  Here. Don't be a stupid idiot. Here we go. Up here. And then we're going to go out this way.
[2792.49s -> 2805.62s]  This guy high. No. I mean, look, now I get, now I understand how fragile the car is. Okay. Wait,
[2805.62s -> 2815.78s]  what? Hold on. Everything's over here. Oh, wait. Hold on a second. I can skip this. I don't have
[2815.78s -> 2822.04s]  to go to the lumber mill. All right. Don't go to the lumber mill. I can go reclaim everything.
[2822.04s -> 2830.54s]  All right. That's fine. Let's go. Don't fuck around. I need a gas station though.
[2830.54s -> 2836.06s]  I'll put the face cam on when I get to the, I'll get, I'll put the face cam on when I get to the
[2836.06s -> 2848.86s]  bridge. Okay. Wait, what are you guys saying? You don't have a crane. What do you mean? I have to,
[2848.86s -> 2853.82s]  wait, I have to go get the lumber stuff because I don't have a crane. Oh, for the love of God.
[2853.82s -> 2856.86s]  All right. Fine. All right. All right. I'll just go get, it's right here. I'm just kidding. I'll
[2856.86s -> 2871.69s]  get it. It's right here. Can I sleep? How do I pass time? Yeah. I'm sleeping. Sleep. How do I
[2871.69s -> 2889.74s]  sleep? All right. Sleep. Skip time. Skip time. Morning. There we go. Now I can see. Let's do
[2889.74s -> 2898.15s]  this again. You might be able to put a crane on the truck. All right. Let's get the lumber. No.
[2898.15s -> 2912.02s]  No, this is wrong because I need to get the, all right. I have to get a trailer. There's two of
[2912.02s -> 2916.49s]  those, but I need the, hold on a second. I need the trailer because I need to bring, I can't,
[2916.49s -> 2919.21s]  I got to bring the trailer up there. Wait, there's a trailer up there. Yeah, there is. Okay.
[2924.07s -> 2932.81s]  Where the metal is, there's a trailer up there. Imagine what your boss thinks about this omega
[2932.81s -> 2954.71s]  low. That doesn't matter to me. I'm my own boss. When was the last time you smoked a crack pipe?
[2955.80s -> 2967.19s]  I've never smoked a crack pipe in my life ever. So none. Not, no, never. My own boss. I don't want
[2967.19s -> 2998.38s]  to run out of gas. That's important. No, no drugs. Drug free. No face cam, no food. I'm going to be
[2998.38s -> 3015.19s]  all right. Okay. I will now give you exactly five minutes of face cam starting now. I fucking can't
[3015.19s -> 3022.41s]  be trusted. I really can't. What's over here? All right. The trailer is right there. Go get the
[3022.41s -> 3036.97s]  trailer. Where's this trailer? This fucking cameraman. Like, oh, stop. Who's flying the drone
[3036.97s -> 3053.11s]  around the car? Just stay here. All right. Is this it? New trailer. This thing's huge. This thing is
[3053.19s -> 3057.27s]  gigantic. All right. That just went into the windshield and I get the guy in the head.
[3057.27s -> 3068.92s]  Attached trailer. Oh my God. It's too big. How? How do I do this? What is this even attached to?
[3069.72s -> 3085.77s]  I do have to, but I have cargo. This is, I don't, this is bad. This is the wrong truck. I can't
[3085.77s -> 3101.70s]  handle this. Oh for the love of God. Are you serious? Oh shit. So I need to go get a different
[3101.70s -> 3132.73s]  trailer. So I have to go recover this trailer down here. That's what you're saying. I don't
[3132.73s -> 3141.98s]  think I can. This is stupid. Just drive. Just drive. Don't run over this person's pool.
[3145.77s -> 3152.71s]  Why is there a pool made out of concrete? Why is there a pool made out of a tree stump? What?
[3155.67s -> 3163.38s]  Why is there a concrete pool in your front yard? I can't, I see you saying I can't put this trailer
[3163.38s -> 3175.11s]  on my thing here. All right. Can I, I'm just going to, can I just drop this off of the bridge
[3175.11s -> 3185.82s]  and come back? All right. Let's think about this logically. There is where I need to get the metal
[3185.82s -> 3201.80s]  here. So what I'm going to do, there's wood down here. Can I get a crane? What do you think? Just
[3201.80s -> 3219.14s]  take two trips, my man. I, it said I had to do it in order. La la waiting, whatever. But I have to
[3219.14s -> 3229.00s]  do it in order. Remember most pools are made of concrete. Not an above ground pool in your front
[3229.08s -> 3236.10s]  yard. Above ground pools are not made out of concrete. Dump the planks? All right. Yeah.
[3236.10s -> 3238.98s]  All right. I'm going to dump the plants in. All right. Fuck it. We're doing two trips. I don't
[3238.98s -> 3257.37s]  care. What is it supposed to be made of? I don't know. It's like a plastic like bendy flat polymer
[3257.37s -> 3264.79s]  thing. I don't know. It's not concrete. It's made out of like a hard weird like polyurethane
[3265.83s -> 3272.23s]  plastic. I don't know. It's made it as something that's not metal. It's like plastic and above
[3272.23s -> 3277.14s]  ground pool. What is it made out of? I'm going to look it up right now. What's an above ground
[3277.14s -> 3291.50s]  pool made out of? Above ground pools are made out of steel, aluminum, and resin. Okay. It's made out
[3291.50s -> 3297.58s]  of resin. Here are the advantages and disadvantages. It's resin. It's made out of resin. I don't know
[3297.58s -> 3308.04s]  what resin is. I just know what it is. I just know that it's a thing that can be made out of stuff.
[3311.24s -> 3317.34s]  Resin is concrete. Resin is not concrete. Resin is like the shit that comes out of fucking plant sap.
[3318.31s -> 3322.15s]  Resin is the stuff that like a tree like has like the sap coming out of it. That's what resin is.
[3323.11s -> 3342.33s]  That's wrong. It's not wrong. All right. Here we go. Cargo management. Let's go. I need metal
[3342.33s -> 3358.92s]  beams. I need to unload this shit. How do I unload? Unpack cargo. Okay. Unpack cargo. How do I unpack
[3358.92s -> 3380.97s]  the cargo? Unpack cargo. I don't want to remove the cargo. I want to unpack it. That's exactly
[3380.97s -> 3397.59s]  what I didn't want to do. I'm gonna be all right. Everything's fine. Fuck it. Whatever. I don't even
[3397.67s -> 3402.31s]  care. Let's go. Cargo management. Give me the metal. Let's go. Okay. All right. Bye. Let's go.
[3402.31s -> 3421.85s]  Go. Go. Go. Don't drive into a wall. Resin has trees in it, right? Other way around. You know
[3421.85s -> 3433.56s]  what I mean? Say what I said backwards. This tree resin, right? Five minutes are up, by the way.
[3441.72s -> 3446.60s]  This thing is pulling to the left. I'm not doing that. Oh, wait. It's like a real car. You have
[3446.60s -> 3452.66s]  to actually change the wheel before you go anywhere. There's a Muppet Muppet streamer.
[3453.30s -> 3468.65s]  I'm just gonna do it one at a time. Ooh la la. No. Give it a rest. Not with that.
[3471.24s -> 3486.92s]  Just drive. Please. I refuse to do that with the camera on because I find it embarrassing.
[3491.40s -> 3501.06s]  I need to refuel though. I'm driving this car like there's a bunch of bees in it. Can I please
[3501.06s -> 3518.95s]  straighten out? All right. Refuel. Anytime there's a bug in the car, like a wasp or a bee or something,
[3518.95s -> 3523.27s]  you kind of just have that freak out mode where you roll down every single window in the car and
[3523.27s -> 3529.35s]  scream and just stay still. You just hope that it's like, and he just goes out the window.
[3531.75s -> 3551.29s]  I can make that, right? All right. I'm almost at that point. Can I lift this up? I'm gonna do
[3551.29s -> 3561.70s]  a tester. Okay. This is where the, this is where the catastrophe started. Can I do anything about
[3561.70s -> 3568.90s]  this? Stop. Stop moving. Stop moving. Stop moving. Stop moving. Stop moving.
[3577.26s -> 3587.10s]  I'm not gonna fall in there again. Nope. Not gonna happen. Oh, handbrake. Okay. Wait, let go of it.
[3589.82s -> 3610.82s]  Can I attach it to the, I'm gonna attach to the, here we go. Right there. Pull it. Come on. What?
[3610.82s -> 3623.80s]  Oh, it's the fucking pole. Give me a break. Flip it. No, no, no. I'll just at least get it out of
[3623.80s -> 3634.25s]  the, get it away from that thing. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. It's flipped.
[3634.25s -> 3655.96s]  I flipped it. Let it go. Okay. I feel like this is probably too dangerous.
[3658.30s -> 3666.97s]  I'm gonna deliver this first. I'm not fucking around. I'm not gonna do this now. All right.
[3666.97s -> 3677.19s]  Here's the bridge. How do I do this? Do I just drive up and it just does it automatically?
[3677.75s -> 3691.21s]  Okay. Nice. Gargo management. When unloading the cargo, you may be presented with different
[3691.21s -> 3696.73s]  unloading options as one cargo may be used to complete different objectives. While the cargo,
[3697.29s -> 3701.45s]  while the current unloading area is used only to complete your current job, there may be others
[3701.45s -> 3714.84s]  that are used in multiple contracts. Okay. Unload. Nice. The bridge is on its way,
[3714.84s -> 3722.63s]  but not there yet to click. You need to deliver more lumber mill. Okay. Nice. Thank you.
[3723.35s -> 3729.83s]  I was about to step on the gas, just drive off and just watch chat. No, it's too early for that.
[3730.55s -> 3741.24s]  Have to do a fall joke. I can't, I want to, can I just pick these up? I don't have a crane.
[3741.24s -> 3749.16s]  Somebody said I need a crane. You got to hit that yoinky splinky.
[3756.26s -> 3761.51s]  Just recover. You're going to spawn next to the lumber mill. Well, let me just see if I can even
[3761.51s -> 3771.29s]  do this. Cause if I can, that's good. Can I just go next to this and wait, can I just attach the
[3771.29s -> 3782.26s]  winch to this? Just drag it. I probably can. Why wouldn't I? Right. Oh, what the hell? Really?
[3782.82s -> 3796.84s]  Okay. Remove cargo. No, it's the new hot tech talk dance. The yoinky splinky.
[3797.56s -> 3810.50s]  This is way too dangerous. This is, yeah, it's too dangerous. Um, I'm just going to go get it.
[3810.50s -> 3830.92s]  Like, I don't care. I need to have complete level one. You know what I mean? I love how he
[3830.92s -> 3836.71s]  just ignores you all. You got to hit that yoinky splinky. I don't know what the hell you're talking
[3836.71s -> 3847.74s]  about. What is a yoinky splinky? Um, that, the yoinky splinky is somebody's legs behind their
[3847.74s -> 3876.73s]  head. Like moving. What was that? Yoinky splinky or no food. What a virgin. What are you talking
[3876.73s -> 3894.97s]  about? This dude doesn't know the yoinky splinky. Ah, what a virgin. Is this lumber mill? All right.
[3894.97s -> 3907.62s]  Yes. Why does he keep reading the worst comments? I'm not. He's pretending, right? He actually
[3907.62s -> 3915.14s]  knows what it is. I don't really. All right. Lumber mill. Let's go. And look, perfectly loaded
[3915.14s -> 3927.72s]  lumber. Although I'm just going to say, fuck it and just do this. All right. Fargo. I need
[3927.80s -> 3953.08s]  wooden plank, wooden plank. Let's go. Done. Move. Just know your meme page for the yoinky splinky.
[3956.10s -> 3959.62s]  I don't know. I'm not. All right. I'm going to move on because I don't know
[3959.62s -> 3964.62s]  nor do I need to put that much more time into knowing what this is. You know what I'm saying?
[3965.42s -> 3973.67s]  I'm just saying. That's been in my head for like a month. I don't know why.
[3976.50s -> 3990.01s]  That just keeps jumping in. I don't, I don't know how. I don't know. What setting am I on? Um,
[3990.81s -> 4001.34s]  I just normal, a career mode, I think. I don't know. All right. We're almost done with level one
[4001.98s -> 4012.62s]  and then I'm going to unlock hopefully the ice level. Slow down here. I don't want to blow it
[4012.62s -> 4026.10s]  here. Part of me just wants to take a left and just drive. No, that goes under the bridge. Why
[4026.10s -> 4031.96s]  would I do that? I was about to do it or just driven into the water. That would have been a
[4031.96s -> 4054.10s]  disaster. Okay. Very good. Learn. Not again. That turn is fucked. It is. That turn comes up on you
[4054.10s -> 4070.22s]  hard and it just dumps you if you don't do it right. We're good. I'm concerned about how you
[4070.22s -> 4078.26s]  drive in real life. I don't have a, a class truck license and I'm using my left thumb to drive a
[4078.26s -> 4100.66s]  car. This is not how you drive a real car. All right. So now what? I got promoted. I just think,
[4100.66s -> 4106.90s]  I just see that guy's face. I just, I just think of the, the pawn star as a guy. Now I let me change
[4106.90s -> 4111.14s]  that guy every time he just keeps popping in my head with like a hat on. All right. When you get
[4111.14s -> 4116.06s]  enough experience, you can get a new driver rank. Every rank provides you with new options
[4116.06s -> 4120.46s]  regarding vehicle and add on purchasing. Cool. Objectives may also require you to reach a certain
[4120.46s -> 4128.95s]  driver rank before they are unlocked. Press down to access your driver profile. Oh, now we can leave
[4128.95s -> 4135.74s]  the peninsula and reach the garage. Oh, I got 2100 bucks. Nice. Every contract completed will provide
[4135.74s -> 4140.46s]  you with money and experience points. Every watch tower discoverable will avoid you with experience.
[4140.46s -> 4150.79s]  XP allows you to unlock new driver ranks. Cool. All right. Nice. Let's go and find the garage.
[4150.79s -> 4156.95s]  It's now marked on the map. My driver ranks. I'm never going to change that profile picture ever.
[4160.09s -> 4168.26s]  That was the please don't recognize me in Team Fortress 2 Avatar. This is your driver profile.
[4169.85s -> 4177.66s]  You can learn a lot of useful information about your progress here. Cool. Yeah. There's 89 missions
[4177.66s -> 4187.40s]  in this game. Holy shit. All right. Let's go to the garage. Yep. He hates his fans. No,
[4189.67s -> 4194.87s]  no. When I used to play TF2 and make TF2 videos, I wanted to make sure that I was at like the same
[4195.43s -> 4200.95s]  exact level as everybody else. So if my name was Jerma985 and I was like, hey guys, it's me,
[4200.95s -> 4206.28s]  Jerma985. Two people on the other team we switched to spy. There'd be three snipers that were just
[4206.28s -> 4211.40s]  aiming for my head. Six people would just stand at the spawn holding their hand in the air and it
[4211.40s -> 4217.42s]  wouldn't even be a game of Team Fortress anymore. So when I was hiding, I was just another player.
[4217.42s -> 4223.78s]  So it was just completely, nobody knew. That's a guy on the other team. I didn't want to like
[4223.78s -> 4229.13s]  fuck up games. I didn't want to go in there and like there's a whole game going on and be like,
[4229.13s -> 4235.93s]  everybody, it's me. I'm here. Where's the line of people? I'm in the server now. Hello.
[4240.01s -> 4247.96s]  My name was like dogshit burrito and I had like weird avatars that weren't connected to me at all.
[4248.68s -> 4256.38s]  He's a celebrity. Oh, look at me. He's a celebrity. No, that's not what I'm saying.
[4256.38s -> 4276.31s]  Oh, watch tower. Oh, look at this celebrity. No, I'm not a celebrity. You're too important to play
[4276.31s -> 4286.86s]  TF2. That's not, that's not even what I'm saying. Oh, fuck. I'm stuck. I should have paid attention.
[4287.42s -> 4316.97s]  Can I get out? I'm not going this way. Where's the winch connected to? Get me out. I'm buried in this
[4316.97s -> 4328.02s]  mud. I can't go anywhere. Shit. What do I do? Well, how was I supposed to know there was this
[4328.02s -> 4339.67s]  weird terrain over here? Low gear. All right. We're just going in. Come on. Just dig through it. Just
[4339.67s -> 4347.40s]  dig. Is it true that you sharted when you jumped through the window? Yes. I'm just going to give
[4347.40s -> 4351.16s]  you that one. You probably just like started laughing. You're probably like, why did you even
[4351.16s -> 4361.80s]  respond to that? What the fuck? All right. I'm stuck again. All right. Now I'm going to attach
[4361.80s -> 4380.39s]  a winch to something over here. Go. Pull me. Pull me through the mud. Come on. All right. Now winch
[4380.39s -> 4391.19s]  and not winch something else. Handbrake right there. Let's go. This was a huge mistake coming
[4391.19s -> 4400.74s]  down here. Come on. Come on. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Stop. I don't want to screw this
[4400.74s -> 4406.20s]  up. I probably shouldn't even drive down this. Wait. Can I go that way? All right. I'm going to
[4406.20s -> 4423.37s]  go across this way. It should get me at least over here. I don't want to drive through the mud. This
[4423.37s -> 4435.99s]  car can't go through the mud. But I can't go through this either. What the fuck? What?
[4436.71s -> 4449.77s]  What do you mean? This is so wet over here. Can I not go here? It's so wet over here. Is it another
[4449.77s -> 4465.77s]  car? It's still mud. Oh, well I think I'll be all right. I can just pull myself. All right. I'm going
[4465.77s -> 4476.94s]  to stay in low gear. Let's just stay on the road maybe. Yeah. This one's not deep. It should be
[4476.94s -> 4483.45s]  okay. There's water here though. Oh God. Don't drive through that. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
[4483.45s -> 4490.28s]  What is that? That's deep mud over there. I think I just screwed myself completely.
[4490.92s -> 4502.15s]  I think I'm such a guy. Do I have to just go for it? I have to turn around. Oh my God. Give me a
[4502.15s -> 4511.58s]  break. Really? Can I just get out of the car and sprint? Drive through or no balls. Full send. Full
[4511.58s -> 4517.72s]  send. Yeah. All right. Let's laugh about the fact that I have to start over again. Where's the garage?
[4521.61s -> 4565.10s]  Okay. It's right here. Come on. Go right. How deep is this? This water's not deep at all. Hold on.
[4565.10s -> 4585.54s]  Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. I'm all right. Okay. I'm so close to just touching this. I just want to
[4585.54s -> 4597.75s]  touch it. There it is. Like, no. I'm fine. Look it. I'm going to be all right. Check this out. I'm
[4597.75s -> 4611.82s]  going to get up here. What in God's name are you doing? I'm trying to get close enough where I can
[4611.82s -> 4618.07s]  just drive into this and activate the fucking watch tower. Swamp joke. It's not a swamp joke.
[4618.71s -> 4643.85s]  Stop pretending. There's nothing to. I was. There's nothing to pretend. Okay. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
[4643.93s -> 4664.07s]  Hold on. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Okay. Now that's exactly what I wanted to do.
[4665.59s -> 4684.73s]  And everybody thought I was fucking stupid. Everybody thought I was an idiot.
[4685.29s -> 4710.94s]  I'll show you in just a moment. You'll know very quickly here. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, what's
[4710.94s -> 4746.06s]  that? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hold on. Thank you. Let's go. Just get me out of the water.
[4746.06s -> 4752.66s]  I just have to touch this and I'll be fine. I'm not even in the water anymore. This is so stupid.
[4753.30s -> 4769.59s]  There we go. Got it. I want you to. I want every single person that said, I want you to go through
[4769.59s -> 4772.95s]  the logs and find everyone that said he's going to get stuck in the water. Fucking idiot. He sucks.
[4772.95s -> 4779.59s]  He's so stupid. He sucks at everything. And I want those people to be timed out for exactly one
[4779.59s -> 4830.87s]  second. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. I'll be fine. Hold on. The laws of physics. I'm a physics major.
[4831.43s -> 4841.16s]  I just have to get far enough over here. This sucks. Stop. I'm fine. It sucks.
[4842.04s -> 4850.49s]  It's I'm do I just have to touch this and I'm going to reset. I'm almost out of gas. All right.
[4850.49s -> 4858.10s]  Come on. Oh my God. I can't move it up. Just winching myself. This is bad. It's actually
[4858.10s -> 4876.52s]  pretty bad. Can I get close enough to be able to attach to that? I'm almost there. Look at how
[4876.52s -> 4885.90s]  close I am. See the I can attach the winch up here. Come on, dude. Let's go. Yes. Yes.
[4885.90s -> 4919.94s]  Yes. All right. Let's go. I just made so much more work for myself. That was so stupid.
[4923.66s -> 4931.00s]  Pull me. Just pull me in. Pull me in. Pull me in. Pull me in. Pull me in. Yes. Touched out.
[4932.90s -> 4948.94s]  Watch tower updated. Yes. There it is. And there I just have to get on the road.
[4949.66s -> 4958.02s]  I probably have to go back. Arm in the garage. All right. I need to I get a different car.
[4959.48s -> 4966.60s]  Can I actually get out of here though? I might be able to. No. Nope. Goodbye. I'm just going to
[4966.60s -> 4977.85s]  yeah I'm just going to recover the car. Look at that. Look at that shit. Change the truck.
[4977.85s -> 5012.81s]  Thank you. Let's go. Wait. Can I attach to this? Wait. Holy shit. Okay. I should just
[5012.81s -> 5021.42s]  I can take them both. All right. Don't be an idiot. I'm going to change. Let's change to the
[5021.42s -> 5030.44s]  truck. Yeah. I'll just bring it with me. Now let me it's can I attach it? Okay. How about
[5030.68s -> 5041.06s]  attach trailer? No. Okay. All right. Attach winch to you here. And we're just going to pull it.
[5042.46s -> 5051.58s]  What's going on? I'm going to drive. Load the truck onto the other truck. I don't think I can
[5051.58s -> 5073.98s]  do that. I'm going to have handbrake on. All right. Let's go. Now I need a good route here.
[5073.98s -> 5084.28s]  Oh shit. I got to go all the way down here. God damn it. Okay. Let's get to here first.
[5084.28s -> 5100.50s]  Who trucks? Yes. I'm thinking it's abandoning this and just getting in the goddamn truck.
[5100.58s -> 5122.44s]  Don't you have a face cam? Cool. Because if I ever get in trouble, then I could just switch
[5122.44s -> 5136.15s]  to the other truck and just walk off. It's simple. Simple. Yellow shirt. Yeah. I never
[5136.15s -> 5145.78s]  usually wear yellow. You're right. I'm a blue, gray, dark, purple, black. My shirts are usually
[5145.78s -> 5161.34s]  kind of in that zone. Sometimes red. Sometimes. Hope we can make this. We can. Good. Blue. Yeah.
[5161.34s -> 5178.84s]  A lot of blue. I love blue. I'm running out of gas. Don't touch your hair.
[5183.56s -> 5193.05s]  Where's another fuel station? Oh shit. There's a watch tower here. Okay. There's not another
[5193.69s -> 5203.78s]  gas station anywhere. Should I fuel up or just say fuck it and just go?
[5203.78s -> 5213.99s]  I feel like I probably should get gas, but I'm not going to. Whatever. Did I? It is just right here.
[5213.99s -> 5229.77s]  I'm going to get it. It'd be dumb to not get it. It's right here. Don't drive over the edge.
[5230.41s -> 5237.06s]  You're going to be stranded if you don't get gas. Why don't you go to the garage?
[5237.06s -> 5241.06s]  And that was the plan before. And then I went into the swamp accidentally.
[5241.78s -> 5252.17s]  It was water here? Since when? Oh god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god.
[5252.17s -> 5269.98s]  Oh my god. Oh my god. That's not. Is that fucking up that truck? Oh shit. Like water is just going
[5269.98s -> 5280.20s]  into that car. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Get out. Change. Change. Change. Change. Change. Change.
[5286.74s -> 5307.78s]  Okay. Here we go. No. Okay. Fuck. I don't want to do that. All right. Let's take care of this first.
[5307.78s -> 5323.93s]  Then I'm going to drive across. Car alright. What's the damage? I think I'm okay. 100. 100.
[5323.93s -> 5334.04s]  100. 82. That's all right. I'll be fine. Yeah. I'm good. I'll be good. Now I'm going to refill
[5334.04s -> 5342.82s]  this one. Should I? I'm just driving. Whatever. I don't care. And I want to sleep too. I don't like
[5342.82s -> 5347.37s]  the darkness. I don't like it. I can just press two buttons and it's bright out.
[5350.89s -> 5355.51s]  Ram. Gas pump. No. I did that already. It doesn't do anything. I'm not doing it again.
[5370.38s -> 5386.89s]  Go faster. How far? This car is going like 25 miles per hour. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. All right.
[5386.89s -> 5393.59s]  We're good. Let's get it on the road here so I don't have to worry about it. Handbrake. Park it.
[5394.31s -> 5416.94s]  Nice truck. Some guy's sister hates you. Okay. Camera in the top left. Actually you're right.
[5417.50s -> 5437.10s]  Put it up here actually. I'll flip it. That feels so weird doesn't it? I'm not going to put the
[5437.10s -> 5450.86s]  camera in the middle. That's bad. Can I get. Am I able to get out of this? Okay. Only out of the
[5450.86s -> 5457.85s]  mud. I'm going to drive around this. This was stupid. I'm going to drive around this because
[5457.85s -> 5465.16s]  why would I do this? This is the dumbest thing ever. I just broke the fucking tree. All right.
[5465.16s -> 5488.49s]  How do I get out of here without causing a problem? No, no, no. Up here. Oh. All right. Thank
[5488.49s -> 5496.73s]  God. Now how do I get out? Watch out. I'm going to abandon the truck. I'm going to abandon the
[5496.73s -> 5503.32s]  trucker thing. I'm abandoning the trucker thing. I don't care. I don't want it. I don't want this
[5503.32s -> 5531.06s]  truck anymore. I don't like it. Wait. Go. Go. Go. No. It's going to get trapped in the fucking
[5531.06s -> 5557.02s]  lawnmower blades and I'm going to get stuck here. Oh, thank God. We're good. Finally. Okay. Fuel up
[5557.02s -> 5573.43s]  and then I'm going to drive around the creek. I'm not doing that again. Let's go. What's a better
[5573.43s -> 5583.06s]  route to get over here? Oh, look at that. Okay. We've got the creek here. I could go down. No,
[5583.06s -> 5587.70s]  there's another creek. Okay. I'm just going. I'm just going. Let's go. I'm going. Fuck it.
[5608.15s -> 5646.28s]  I'm so impatient. I can't. I'm going to get over here. Handbrake. Handbrake, please. Okay. Attach.
[5646.28s -> 5662.07s]  Let's go. Come on. This is the mouse taking the splinter out of the lion's paw. Yes. All right.
[5662.07s -> 5671.40s]  We're good. This is going. All right. I don't know if I should do this. It's getting too close.
[5671.40s -> 5678.17s]  It's too heavy. It's too heavy. Okay. Stop. Stop. Stop. Slowly stop the cars. Slowly stop the cars.
[5678.17s -> 5690.79s]  Slowly stop the cars. Okay. Stop. Handbrake. Okay. Switch cars immediately. All right. We're
[5690.79s -> 5708.73s]  good. This is Karazhan level. What do you mean? Karazhan. All right. We're good. All right. I'm
[5708.73s -> 5717.54s]  fine. Don't say those words. Are we ever going to wear a wig? Probably not. I don't know. It means
[5717.54s -> 5722.26s]  comfy. Oh, they're comparing it to the worst stream I've ever done. I don't know. I disagree. I'm
[5722.26s -> 5729.53s]  having a good time. During the Karazhan stream, I was just like fucking hate streaming. I hate
[5729.53s -> 5733.37s]  broadcasting. Like that was honestly like I just wanted to turn off my stream and never come back.
[5737.88s -> 5742.12s]  I was like I'm actually having a good time. Sunflowers? Yeah. I'll show you the sunflowers.
[5747.67s -> 5754.50s]  Next stream. I'm going to start No More Heroes 3 this coming weekend. This is far from the worst.
[5754.50s -> 5757.30s]  Yeah. They're just trying to get, just trying to push buttons. They're just trying to like
[5757.30s -> 5765.45s]  push your buttons. I get it. Okay. I got to be careful because I'm not going right.
[5768.22s -> 5777.00s]  We need to go. Where's the garage? All right. I'm going to go down this road here and this is an
[5777.00s -> 5782.20s]  intersection here. Let's figure it out. I'm just going to go this way. We hate you for real.
[5783.42s -> 5789.98s]  Oh, whatever. There's gas over here. That's fine. Good. All right.
[5790.62s -> 5795.88s]  Take the regular road. Don't be an idiot. Don't go that way. What does that sign say? That sign,
[5797.58s -> 5805.03s]  um, I don't even know what that is. That's a, that's like a truck.
[5806.82s -> 5812.01s]  Okay. All right. I thought it was a mountain. Okay. It's a don't. Watch out. It's bumpy. I get it.
[5812.73s -> 5827.14s]  Bumpy road. It's a beached whale. Okay. This is not that bad. It's pretty good.
[5830.50s -> 5843.88s]  Okay. Well, that's a problem. That's an issue. Can I go around it?
[5850.54s -> 5862.31s]  Flores. I just did like a foster do raw. Why did that all get knocked down? Wait,
[5862.31s -> 5873.61s]  can I honk on it? We'll break this. Uh, I'm going to get, I I'm getting in the other truck.
[5874.33s -> 5882.38s]  I'm not going to screw around here in the other car. First of all, turn the engine off of this.
[5882.38s -> 5895.62s]  How do I do that? The handbrake on, turn the engine off. Let's go. I'm not going to mess around
[5895.62s -> 5906.65s]  here. I have to get around this. I go through it. I can just go through here. Excuse me. Um,
[5907.75s -> 5927.54s]  excuse me. I can't go through it. It's there's a wall there. I'm going to keep all wheel drive on.
[5927.54s -> 5938.58s]  Should I be doing this? Is this the correct thing to do? I can't even see in front of me.
[5939.22s -> 5953.06s]  There's no way I'm going to be able to get the Mack truck over here. All right. Back on the road.
[5953.06s -> 5962.30s]  Garage. I'm going to the garage right now. That's the plan. All right. Well, that's what that truck
[5962.30s -> 5966.87s]  is. I can come back later. Maybe. I don't know. All right. Where do I go from here? Straight down
[5966.87s -> 5992.01s]  here. Let's go. That's enough of the face cam face cam has been allotted. Stop. I'm not just going to
[5992.01s -> 5996.25s]  drive that way. It's a bad idea. This is the first area I want to get. I at least want to see like
[5996.25s -> 6002.89s]  one or two more areas. I want to see the snow level. I want to see the, I don't know. I want to
[6002.89s -> 6007.45s]  see like the other zones. I don't want to just see the mud area. This is cool, but I want to see snow
[6007.45s -> 6030.47s]  and ice. Stop driving in the middle of the road. Why? The drunker I get, the more that I enjoy.
[6031.35s -> 6043.37s]  You drinking and just hanging out. All right. All right. There's a watch tower over here. All right.
[6043.37s -> 6050.23s]  Um, so we need to go right to the farm. We need to go down here. That's probably, that's like a,
[6050.23s -> 6053.27s]  that's going to be like the Lord of the Rings part where they're on the side of the mountain.
[6054.07s -> 6069.64s]  Like the rocks are fighting each other or whatever. Don't even tell me. Don't get stuck here.
[6070.20s -> 6089.54s]  Are you kidding me? How? Oh, how did that even happen? All right. Let's go. Keep it on low gear
[6091.66s -> 6098.68s]  and just, am I going to get stuck here? Is there another car? You have all wheel drive off.
[6099.24s -> 6118.47s]  Shit, that's right. Thanks. All right. New area farm. I wonder if there's a, a new car. Is low
[6118.47s -> 6122.87s]  gear better? I think it is because it doesn't move the tires. Look, I'm going to say something really
[6122.87s -> 6127.35s]  stupid probably. And those of you that know anything about cars and off-roading is low
[6127.35s -> 6134.76s]  gear better because the tires like grip the ground and the tires spin slower. Is it like,
[6134.76s -> 6140.42s]  oh, the tires spin slower and that grips the ground harder. That's correct, right?
[6141.14s -> 6157.58s]  There's more torque, right? It spins slower. Yeah. Okay. So I had it right. There's less
[6157.58s -> 6166.49s]  displacement to the ground. Yeah. Yeah. Nice. Um, what's even over here? Not really anything.
[6167.13s -> 6170.49s]  All right. This is where it gets dangerous. I'm kind of afraid of this part, but let's just go.
[6170.49s -> 6187.64s]  Whatever. Screw it. I got plenty of gas. I'm going to make it. I hope it's very rocky over here. This
[6187.64s -> 6199.66s]  is bumpy. This is getting bumpy. Do this in real life. I would have died an hour ago.
[6203.10s -> 6215.61s]  Stream would just be live of wherever I ended up. So no, the camera would just be pointing to the
[6215.61s -> 6223.50s]  sky. So whatever like ravine I fell in. Nope. No, thank you. Leave it to the professionals.
[6239.50s -> 6243.58s]  All right. We're almost there. This is, I don't, I got to be careful here because this is really,
[6243.58s -> 6248.54s]  really muddy. I'm going to try to drive away from that because I don't want to get stuck in that.
[6249.18s -> 6257.14s]  We avoid it. Don't tip. Don't tip. You're good. All right. I got to assess the situation here.
[6259.61s -> 6286.50s]  I kind of need to, uh, go around the left side. Uh-oh. Uh, okay. How are you supposed to do this?
[6288.44s -> 6302.74s]  Don't fall in the water. Oh my goodness. Don't fall in the water. I can't move the car.
[6302.74s -> 6317.72s]  All right. Just all wheel drive, floor it, pull. We're good. When does the stream start? Uh,
[6317.72s -> 6339.24s]  starting soon. No, no, no, no. Attach here. Right here. And then we're going to go all wheel drive,
[6340.06s -> 6354.86s]  pull floor it. Nice. I made it up. I did it. We're almost there. I'm almost in the garage.
[6354.86s -> 6365.93s]  I've almost completed chapter one. I've almost done it. I don't think I have to be in a low gear
[6365.93s -> 6380.94s]  right now. Yeah, this is fine. Oops. Hold on. In the grass. Remember the road you avoided in
[6380.94s -> 6387.62s]  the beginning led to the garage. Yeah. We got to do it the hard way. There it is. Nice. Finally.
[6389.35s -> 6397.54s]  I made it. You've discovered your first garage. What you have done so far is the meat of the game.
[6397.54s -> 6401.38s]  Explore and discover watchtowers, complete contracts, earn rewards and find garages
[6401.38s -> 6410.25s]  to improve or buy new vehicles. Vehicles. All right. So what do I do? Upgrade location
[6410.25s -> 6416.33s]  discovered. Get upgrade. You can find upgrades in the world. They may not apply to your current
[6416.33s -> 6422.90s]  vehicle, but will be useful for others. An all wheel drive powertrain that can provide torque
[6422.98s -> 6432.54s]  connected. Not available for the current truck. Okay. Whoa. What happened with that? Garage
[6432.54s -> 6446.23s]  discovered. You can use the garage to turn your truck into a real monster. All right. 850 bucks.
[6446.87s -> 6454.44s]  What do I do? Customize. The garage is used to store, upgrade, customize, buy and sell vehicles,
[6454.44s -> 6463.26s]  but also for traveling to other regions. Okay. Holy shit. All right. The engine. You can upgrade
[6463.26s -> 6472.50s]  the engine. That means more power. That's what I currently have. Explore Michigan to find this.
[6473.14s -> 6483.82s]  I don't have any of these things. Stock gearbox. More control. Suspension. What the hell?
[6485.19s -> 6497.46s]  I want that. And I want huge tires. Ooh, wait a minute. Highway all-terrain or all-terrain?
[6498.10s -> 6509.13s]  What do I have? I have 8,800 bucks. On-road good, off-road average. Off-road. Okay. On-road average,
[6509.13s -> 6522.17s]  off-road good. Mud average. Mud good. Right? I think I want mud. Mud good. But on truck nuts.
[6524.95s -> 6530.07s]  Excellent on-road, but this is okay. I have terrible in mud right now. I definitely want to get,
[6530.79s -> 6536.71s]  who cares about on-road? It's a regular road. You're going to be fine. Let's go with,
[6536.71s -> 6551.83s]  let's go with mud. Let's go with the 31 inch AS2s. I think so. A winch. Whoa. A low strength winch
[6551.83s -> 6555.75s]  set up with a dedicated battery unit. Not as powerful as more common variants. It can operate
[6555.75s -> 6562.36s]  even when the vehicle's engine is turned off. That's a lot of money. I'll keep the stock one.
[6563.91s -> 6574.07s]  Engageable lock? Snorkel? What do you mean a snorkel? A mushroom-shaped snorkel that protects
[6574.07s -> 6577.75s]  your engine from taking in water. Wait, wait. Actually, I put my mouth on that and breathe?
[6578.31s -> 6588.55s]  What does that, what do you mean a snorkel? I gotta get that, right? Yeah, I want the snorkel
[6588.55s -> 6595.53s]  because then I can go into water. Frame add-ons. Can't do any of these. Can I do any? Oh, rear
[6595.53s -> 6609.40s]  bumper. I have 10. Oh, I definitely have to get the park ranger beacon, right? Yeah. I want the
[6609.40s -> 6627.58s]  Jurassic park vehicle. Alright, front bumper. I like that. Miscellaneous. Side pipe thresholds?
[6627.58s -> 6635.18s]  Sure. What about rims? Why would I want rims? They just don't, they just get really dirty.
[6635.90s -> 6653.98s]  I can change the color. Did I make it the German 985 mobile? Okay. Can I do any other colors?
[6655.02s -> 6661.03s]  Well, I can do that one at least. That's fine. The Jurassic park vehicle is that color, isn't it?
[6663.13s -> 6681.61s]  Bobbleheads? Oh! Auto! I can't believe there's an auto! Accessories. Hearts, ace of spades,
[6681.61s -> 6692.78s]  autumn leaf, golden leaf, pine tree. Uh, how about um, dream catcher, hype monster,
[6693.83s -> 6714.25s]  ranch. How about let's go with uh, let's go with rental car. There. Stickers. Shut up and take my
[6714.25s -> 6724.81s]  winch. Light my fire. Your adventure. Should I do what like those people do when they have like,
[6726.07s -> 6744.97s]  Clinton Gore, like 1998, like still on their car. Bush Chaney. I'm in charge. Wild. Off-road. How
[6744.97s -> 6759.48s]  about his mud? I like that one. Exterior stickers? Oh god. Hot warning. Harsh driver. I kind of like
[6759.48s -> 6775.08s]  the bullwinkle one. I like mud monster. Swamp surfer. Off-road club. King of the hill. Mastodon.
[6775.64s -> 6793.19s]  Wing mechanic. It's crazy that like, all these could be the label of every craft beer I've ever
[6793.19s -> 6816.01s]  had. Oh, the crazy elephant! Oh, I like the tiger. Hide. Pedal to the metal. Pumped up. Young
[6816.01s -> 6834.18s]  driving. Top gear. Truck. Truck. For mother Russia. I like this one. This reminds me of like, every
[6834.18s -> 6838.10s]  90s fucking beverage that you had that was available. That was off-brand. That wasn't like
[6838.10s -> 6851.46s]  Pepsi or Coke brand. I like it. Windshield stickers. Don't these get in the way? Where's um,
[6851.46s -> 6864.36s]  live laugh love? Where is it? I hope it's here. Must eat mud. Just putting that shit on an off-road
[6864.36s -> 6882.47s]  car. I like must eat mud. That's a good one. Bulldog. Dolphin. Cobra. Stavortooth. How about
[6882.47s -> 6894.71s]  the, uh, how about the cobra? All right, cool. I wish I had more to do. Well, at least I got better
[6894.71s -> 6915.85s]  tires. Can I clean it? Truck store. Oh, man. Are you serious? All right, truck store. This is your
[6915.85s -> 6926.33s]  truck store. You have to be a certain rank. Oh, Chevy CK 1500. What else is there? 126,000.
[6927.48s -> 6937.58s]  What is that? Wait, wait, you, I can actually buy these? You can drive around in a crane? Why?
[6937.58s -> 6956.14s]  There's a lot of cars. Is that a fire truck? Oh, that's pretty cool. Highway. Heavy duty. Heavy.
[6956.87s -> 6968.06s]  Off-road. Scout. Damn it. I want this so bad. That sucks that I can't have it. This truck is
[6968.06s -> 6978.68s]  not available in North America. What? I can't buy this because I live in America? Not available in
[6978.68s -> 6993.64s]  North America? Am I getting like country gated? Why? Oh, in game. Oh, I was going to say that's
[6993.64s -> 6999.42s]  insane. Sorry, sorry. These are, these are only available in, uh, in like Russia. These are only
[6999.42s -> 7008.76s]  available in like EU. Only available in Europe. I was desperately trying to figure out what that
[7008.76s -> 7018.31s]  actually meant. All right. Well, I got my cool car now. Some interesting trucks or resources can
[7018.31s -> 7022.63s]  only be found in other locations. Let's do some traveling. Prepare your truck for transportation
[7022.63s -> 7028.95s]  by using the retain function with X. Retain. Vehicle is now placed in the truck storage.
[7028.95s -> 7037.32s]  You're ready to travel. Go to the global map with Y. Oh shit. Okay. You're currently in Michigan.
[7037.32s -> 7054.04s]  Let's go to Alaska. Let's go to Alaska. Yes. Awesome. Snow time. Let's go. You have a garage
[7054.04s -> 7057.80s]  waiting for you here. This is your primary base of operations for the time being. Let's get inside,
[7057.80s -> 7069.22s]  select the garage and the objects tab and enter it. Garage. This is what I was looking forward to.
[7069.22s -> 7089.56s]  We finally get to play the title. All right. Truck storage. Where's my truck? DLC. Oh, look at these.
[7089.56s -> 7097.53s]  There's so much cooler. That's, I want this, but I don't have enough money. Why is it $20,000 to buy
[7097.53s -> 7108.41s]  this? Oh, I can sell it. Oh, I can sell this and buy this. What's the DLC? How much does it cost?
[7108.41s -> 7117.45s]  Can I deploy it? Holy shit. I actually do own it. Why do I own? I own the DLC. Did I buy the like
[7117.45s -> 7124.74s]  exclusive edition? How do I own this? Are you kidding me? That's awesome. I'm so happy. Just
[7124.74s -> 7131.88s]  sell it all and just put like a bunch of truck nuts on the car. I think I bought, I must have
[7131.88s -> 7137.24s]  bought the digital deluxe version of the game. Oh hell yeah. I want to see how this works.
[7137.24s -> 7144.49s]  All right. What am I? I'm going to sell one so I can upgrade, I think. No, I just want to see what
[7144.49s -> 7150.94s]  it looks like. Over to Alaska. Now, you know, the basics of the game is up to you to scout,
[7150.94s -> 7156.60s]  accept contracts and upgrade or buy new vehicles and conquer the wilderness. Completing contracts
[7156.60s -> 7160.04s]  in Alaska might be tougher because of the weather conditions. If you want to be more prepared,
[7160.04s -> 7173.61s]  you're free to come back to Michigan and explore Alaska later. Let's, hell yeah. All right. I'm
[7173.61s -> 7178.23s]  going to go, I want to just take a look for a minute. I was going to go up down. I was going
[7178.23s -> 7182.31s]  to, I went into the watch tower. I'm going to go down the road. All right. We have enterprise.
[7183.19s -> 7188.70s]  Let's look at how much shit there is here. Type, line, instruction, oil delivery.
[7189.58s -> 7198.68s]  And this is very overwhelming. Drilling equipment, drill rig, from water to land,
[7199.72s -> 7209.14s]  oil delivery. Okay. Deliver to the service site. I need oil barrels. I need to deliver oil barrels
[7209.14s -> 7221.72s]  to a bunch of places. Where do I get the oil barrels? Okay. I'm invested. Let's go. Wait,
[7221.72s -> 7227.18s]  it's locked. Why? Oh shit. I have to go in the straight line here. We've got an urgent contract
[7227.18s -> 7231.18s]  for you. Local fuel company is building a pipeline and just hired us as a subcontractor.
[7231.18s -> 7239.48s]  Deliver everything they need fast. I need service spare parts times two. Okay. Service spare parts
[7239.48s -> 7246.42s]  times two. You have to go through the tunnel that connects locations to reach your target destination.
[7247.22s -> 7253.14s]  So service spare parts are here at the service hub. And then we have to go to the pipeline thing.
[7254.87s -> 7266.84s]  All right. Let's go. I'm ready. Buy and sell trailers. All right. Wait, I need something.
[7266.84s -> 7275.91s]  How am I going to put oil barrels on here? All-wheel drive is always on on this thing.
[7283.66s -> 7292.12s]  I need a trailer. Put them on the seats. Just put them in the back seat. That's very slippery.
[7292.12s -> 7310.54s]  This is very slippery. Maybe I should get the big thing. I wonder if I can pull them with the
[7310.54s -> 7322.02s]  winch. Does this thing have a winch? Yeah, I got to put snow tires on here. I have no idea what's
[7322.02s -> 7337.86s]  on here right now. Uh, this seems to do okay in the snow. This is important. Press one for auto.
[7338.42s -> 7351.69s]  Oh, he's not even in here. Oh, this is the first person. Cool. All right. Service spare parts.
[7351.69s -> 7371.61s]  I can load it. What do I get out of this view? Two, one. Oh, load. I can't load it. Shit. Well,
[7371.61s -> 7388.65s]  hold on. Yeah, I can't put it on here. What is this? Your task are small additional objectives
[7388.65s -> 7393.32s]  that will often make your life easier. What opportunity to earn money that discover when
[7393.32s -> 7398.70s]  exploring the world. All right. What is this task? Name's Pete. I work for a transport company called
[7398.70s -> 7403.42s]  Alaskan Transit. We've had an unfortunate accident that's resulted in containers of tools stuck in
[7403.42s -> 7413.51s]  the river. Can you locate them and get them to the base? Yeah, sure. Yeah, I need it. I need a
[7413.51s -> 7419.54s]  bigger car. I'm going to take the big thing. I have an important question. Do you freeze your bread?
[7420.34s -> 7427.91s]  I don't. I mean, if you buy more than one loaf at a time, I guess maybe you could do that, right?
[7427.91s -> 7446.87s]  I don't freeze my bread. Let's go to the garage. There's a trailer here. All right. I'm ready. I
[7446.87s -> 7450.07s]  freeze my bread. Yeah, it lasts longer. But if you're going to eat it, if you know you're going to
[7450.07s -> 7468.23s]  eat a loaf of bread in a week or two, why would you freeze it? It's for the crunch. So it's crisp.
[7471.10s -> 7476.42s]  Why are you eating crispy bread? Are you talking about like toasting it? Why does it need to be
[7476.42s -> 7484.42s]  crunchy? When you toast it, wouldn't it? The moisture kind of be weird. I don't know. I feel
[7484.42s -> 7506.14s]  like it would just start dripping water. Where's the garage? It evaporates. It doesn't. I just did
[7506.14s -> 7523.94s]  it. It's a little dry though. Yeah. No, I'm not freezing my bread. No, thanks. I'm taking the big
[7523.94s -> 7529.93s]  thing. I'm going to put some new tires on it. I'm going to sell some shit too. Why not? All right.
[7529.93s -> 7539.08s]  Truck storage. Which one of these do I not give a shit about? This one's awesome. This one's really
[7539.08s -> 7552.07s]  cool. This one's ugly. Oh, wait, hold on. Highway mud tires, all-terrain. All right. This is the
[7552.07s -> 7560.39s]  mud. This is the one that I can, is going to be good for the snow. This one is a highway car.
[7561.19s -> 7576.81s]  It says all-wheel drive switchable. This is worth $40,000. I'm selling it. Now I've got $40,000.
[7576.81s -> 7588.30s]  All right. Let's go like this. Customize it. I'm just gonna, I got to go too crazy here. Tires.
[7588.30s -> 7594.63s]  Here we go. What does it have right now? This is on-road, off-road. Mud is average,
[7594.63s -> 7603.46s]  which would be snow too, wouldn't it? On-road, poor. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Keep this. Who cares
[7603.46s -> 7618.79s]  about on-road? Yeah. Definitely keep these on. Okay. Get a snorkel on here. Saddle high. Roof
[7618.79s -> 7623.75s]  rack. A roof-mounted trunk carrying supplies, fuel, and some basic repair tools. Oh yeah. Let's go.
[7626.86s -> 7640.71s]  Sideboard bed. High saddle. Yeah. And give me the bed. This looks pretty good. All right. Rooftop.
[7641.35s -> 7655.26s]  What does one even mean? 1X. All right. That's good. Front bumper. Solaneous. I like the orange.
[7655.26s -> 7675.67s]  No, I don't. Big horns. What is this DLC? It's a bowl. No, I like the, like this one.
[7676.23s -> 7696.20s]  Can you change tires? I could. Get auto in there. And then, um, where is it? Mud. And then we put
[7696.20s -> 7709.74s]  the mud monster here. And then mud up. Mud up or shut up. Hide the fire. Looks good to me.
[7715.53s -> 7725.59s]  I don't think I can do chain tires. Yeah. They're not unlocked. These would be good for now. All
[7725.59s -> 7743.96s]  right. Let's try it. Uh, what the hell? That was weird. Now, should I get? I have a couple things
[7743.96s -> 7748.66s]  going on here. Let's do the, uh, okay. I want to do the pipe thing. Let's go to the service hub.
[7748.66s -> 7752.49s]  Let's just do, let's get this out of the way. And then where's this other thing that has the
[7752.49s -> 7760.92s]  parts in the river or something? Containers in the river. Yeah. This one. Oh shit. It's right here.
[7760.92s -> 7765.34s]  Perfect. All right. All right. Now let's really actually move. Let's go.
[7765.98s -> 7788.30s]  Where are those markers I just put? All right. This has got a all wheel drive too. Doesn't it?
[7788.30s -> 7800.97s]  Oh yeah. It does. This thing is a monster. There's an Easter egg. If you hit 80 miles per
[7800.97s -> 7823.86s]  hour with this truck, which way should I go? Stay on the road. It's so distracting. It's too
[7823.86s -> 7837.85s]  dark. You're being unsafe. Well, I'm just trying to. How do I turn the headlights on?
[7841.10s -> 7857.32s]  I don't know how to turn the headlights on. H L B plus B. Oh God. I can see. I haven't been able
[7857.32s -> 7862.28s]  to see this whole time in the dark. I was like, it sucks being out at night. You can't do anything.
[7870.17s -> 7878.98s]  All right. Here's the parts. We have a spare parts loaded up. Looks good. Deliver those parts.
[7879.62s -> 7897.94s]  You're playing with a controller. Omega lull. Yeah. Why? Wait, you.
[7898.58s -> 7904.55s]  Why would you want to play this game without a controller? W A S D in the mouse does not
[7904.55s -> 7909.83s]  translate well to car movement. It just doesn't. It's not a natural turning of the wheel motion.
[7910.71s -> 7925.30s]  Like being able to actually have a stick move left, right up. A D no. And the trigger is almost
[7925.30s -> 7931.30s]  like a gas pedal. It's like step on the gas, not pressing W with like your index finger. It has
[7931.30s -> 7936.01s]  like a little bit of resistance. It's like pulling, stepping on the gas. All right. What
[7936.01s -> 7941.21s]  do I need to do first? All right. I need to deliver these to the pipeline, but wait,
[7943.48s -> 7955.72s]  uh, I gotta go here first. They're everything. We're going this way. Let's go. Oh, there's a
[7955.72s -> 7974.90s]  watch tower right here. Do you get the watch tower first? Are you going to get the steam
[7974.90s -> 7984.33s]  upper decker? I don't, I, are you talking about the steam, uh, game pad like switch thing?
[7985.37s -> 7988.41s]  I don't know why you're calling it an upper decker. Like you taking a shit in somebody's
[7988.41s -> 7993.05s]  tank in their bathroom. What do you, why up? Why are you calling it an upper decker? That's
[7993.05s -> 8003.02s]  freaking me out. Are you calling it that? Hey dude, you're going to take an upper decker
[8003.02s -> 8018.26s]  in the steam box? Um, I know. Why did you say upper decker? I need to know what you mean.
[8020.76s -> 8032.74s]  It's called the steam deck. Yeah, but a steam upper deck. I just imagine a guy playing that
[8032.74s -> 8040.38s]  thing on the toilet. And like, that's why you called it that because he's taking a shit playing
[8040.38s -> 8048.73s]  the steam deck. It's being correlated that way. I'm like, yeah, no, no, it's nothing wrong way.
[8048.73s -> 8054.28s]  I was terrified to go this way because it was weird. I'm going to go this way. I'm going to,
[8054.28s -> 8073.91s]  I'm trying to go on the actual road up for a decker. Here we go. All right. I just want to
[8073.91s -> 8087.13s]  get the tower. Shit. This is supposed to be good in the off road. I hope I don't get stuck. This
[8087.13s -> 8099.56s]  is half a winch. Thank God. Blow it down. I'm in deep, deep snow right now. But to answer the
[8099.56s -> 8109.48s]  question, I, well, I don't know. I might get the steam upper decker. No, I'm good. I can move.
[8110.04s -> 8122.36s]  It depends. It really depends on that thing. If it has a game gear battery or not,
[8126.30s -> 8141.11s]  like if that thing doesn't last from a Vegas to LA plane ride, I don't want it. If lock was H
[8146.52s -> 8154.25s]  if law, they didn't teach me that. What's a diff lock. I heard it lasts about
[8154.25s -> 8163.03s]  four to nine hours on depending on load L B Y. Div log is only available on low gear.
[8165.42s -> 8168.06s]  Is this, should I have these both on whenever I'm trying to go through rough terrain?
[8171.45s -> 8175.69s]  So this turns this thing into like a tank, right? Like treads. I have no idea what this does,
[8176.33s -> 8180.04s]  but holy shit. I'm about to go up a hill. This is not going to happen.
[8184.14s -> 8205.78s]  I don't think this is going to happen. Very concerned about this. Okay. All right. Didn't
[8205.78s -> 8219.80s]  even give this truck a chance. All right. Left or right? Uh, right. Hopefully. I hope I don't get
[8219.80s -> 8228.58s]  killed here. This is a comfy game. I did want my first screen back from the dollhouse to be,
[8228.58s -> 8236.46s]  to be like a comfy stream. I mean, hang out, man. I got to turn off this lock because I can't move.
[8240.76s -> 8244.78s]  Well, it looks like we're going this way because I can't turn the tires.
[8245.34s -> 8265.78s]  This is stressing me out. I mean, it's kind of, it's, it's not a high stress. I feel like we're
[8265.78s -> 8271.27s]  going to get a probably a high stress few streams this weekend because I'm starting no more heroes
[8271.27s -> 8278.82s]  three. Probably did that on, I want to, I don't know, Saturday started on Saturday because I
[8278.82s -> 8289.62s]  really do want to go back to being on the weekends again. How am I going to get that? I, am I going
[8289.62s -> 8300.04s]  to activate this? Whatever I'm going for. I don't care. I just have to get, get close enough.
[8310.47s -> 8328.63s]  Careful. I'm going to be careful. Did I cliff? No. Hope I can get out of this. All right. Unlock it.
[8328.63s -> 8337.38s]  Come on. Yeah. We'll be going back to Saturday, Sunday streams, Friday, Saturday, Saturday,
[8338.18s -> 8341.54s]  one or two times a week depending on what we're doing. Uh, we're at, we're going to have to do
[8341.54s -> 8361.02s]  at least two streams in a row because of no more heroes. God, what is all this? Where am I? Oh,
[8361.02s -> 8372.62s]  what? Oh, I'm up here. Cargo container. I can't get this right now. All right. Shit. I need to do
[8372.62s -> 8376.94s]  this. This, this was worth a lot of money. All right. I know what I'm doing. I'm dumping the
[8376.94s -> 8388.78s]  cargo here and I'm going to pick this up because I need these two. Yep. Okay. I need to get these
[8388.78s -> 8400.65s]  two things. This thing not back up. Let's go to the pipeline. No, no, no, no. What do you mean?
[8400.65s -> 8406.17s]  Why, why, why? I need a crane. Oh shit. Okay. Can I, am I just going to break if I drive across this
[8406.17s -> 8419.00s]  thing? I feel like this is a rickety ass bridge. I am scared of going over this. How much do I
[8419.00s -> 8433.29s]  weigh? Like 40,000 pounds. This doesn't look sturdy at all. I think this is a good idea.
[8440.15s -> 8458.14s]  Easy. Okay. I'm on it. All right. Turns out it was safe. Now I got to get out to the road here. Can I
[8458.14s -> 8461.74s]  just drive straight? All right. Straight. And then we're going to go up here where the, the pipe
[8461.74s -> 8482.55s]  things are. All right. Let's go. Get out. It was a 27 point turn. Yeah. Well, when you're in,
[8483.27s -> 8487.75s]  when you're in like an original Burger King chicken sandwich length car, you have to be
[8487.75s -> 8522.42s]  fucking careful. Oh, I want one of those now. So bad. Am I doing this right? Is there, was there
[8522.42s -> 8561.86s]  a tree? You can't just pull, just pull me through the, just go. What the hell? I can't see anything.
[8561.86s -> 8576.30s]  Why did I go this way? What the fuck am I doing? I can't, why would I drive through the woods?
[8577.10s -> 8596.14s]  What the hell am I thinking? It's so dark. Go to bed. Just wake up in like an hour. Come on,
[8596.14s -> 8628.30s]  back up. Back up. Back up. Oh, what a comfy stream. I'm working on it. Pull. Come on. It's so close.
[8635.62s -> 8641.98s]  All right. Pull me this way. There we go. All right. Stop. This is a great view actually. Keep
[8641.98s -> 8669.67s]  this view. Shit. No, I can't see. Is this a tree over here? No, it is a tree. I didn't even load in
[8669.67s -> 8677.35s]  my game. Fuck. No. There's a tree on every side. This is the worst possible thing I could have done.
[8678.07s -> 8685.94s]  This is the worst possible thing I could have done. Oh my God. I think I have to pull myself
[8685.94s -> 8705.53s]  backwards. Fuck. Hold on. I think I'm okay. Wait. Hold on. There's a spot right here.
[8738.33s -> 8747.83s]  Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn. Strain it out is the opportunity right here. Make sure the tires
[8747.83s -> 8760.87s]  are straight. Go. Yeah. Stop. I can't see anything. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[8760.87s -> 8772.62s]  Where's the road? I'm not even halfway. I turned around. How did I turn around? I'm facing this way
[8772.62s -> 8782.89s]  now. How? What? I don't understand. What are you talking about? I didn't turn around. I've been
[8782.89s -> 8790.78s]  going the same direction the whole time. You put these mirrors down. Hold on. Settle down. Relax.
[8790.78s -> 8797.19s]  Not a big deal. No, I'm going the right way. Why is it looking like that?
[8799.96s -> 8814.39s]  All right. Attach. I have to pull myself this way. I feel like I was playing Madden. I wanted to
[8814.39s -> 8818.79s]  select the guy all the way to the right so I could run and try to fucking kill the quarterback.
[8818.79s -> 8828.82s]  That's what I did every time. Every play. I've got to take a hard right. That's what I'm going for.
[8829.54s -> 8839.06s]  There it is. Okay. There's an opening. All right. I'm going to get through here.
[8839.70s -> 8846.50s]  There we go. Just go right through the needle right here. Where's the next tree?
[8847.22s -> 8867.80s]  It's right in front of that, isn't it? Which way are the tires turning? Looks like a pretty
[8867.80s -> 8884.94s]  straight shot right here. No, there's a bump. There's a bump, but give me the first person.
[8885.83s -> 8905.24s]  Oh shit. Okay. Hold on. All right. Okay. Straight ahead. Straight ahead. Fuck. All right. Now what?
[8905.24s -> 8911.08s]  I think I can just go straight. I need the first person is probably better here.
[8919.90s -> 8935.90s]  You see a road yet? Where's the road? Is that an opening? All right. Listen. I'm going to. Okay.
[8935.90s -> 8953.98s]  Careful. This is the dumbest thing I've ever done. I don't know why I did this. I could have
[8953.98s -> 8963.64s]  reset 20 minutes ago. All right. We're going to turn this way and pull it. No, wrong way. Good.
[8964.54s -> 8983.11s]  Good. Okay. Now I got a shot this way. Is this ever going to end? I'm trying to go this way.
[8985.26s -> 8990.46s]  Fucking God. I give up, I think. It's time to give up. It's time to give up. I'm facing. I've
[8990.46s -> 9000.07s]  given up. I don't think I can do this. I need to keep a marker here. Delete all markers and put one
[9000.07s -> 9010.70s]  right here. My God. I've made it harder. I was here and I could have just gone this way and now
[9010.70s -> 9018.30s]  I have to go through this. What happened? I'm so confused how I did this. What did I think was
[9018.30s -> 9024.78s]  going to happen? I'm so distraught. I don't understand. Okay. Settle down. I'm going to get
[9024.78s -> 9027.90s]  through this shit. You and me. We're going to be, we're going to get through this together.
[9029.80s -> 9040.90s]  Oh, he doesn't even know, dude. Hold on. First and 10. 40 yard line. Okay. Got a, huh.
[9041.46s -> 9055.14s]  Sprint. Tackle. Tackle. I don't care. Come off sides. Heard a, did I break it? What happened
[9055.14s -> 9063.70s]  to the winch? Winch is okay. I got to, if I just go straight from here, don't be an idiot. Here we
[9063.70s -> 9072.10s]  go. Oh, by the way, every time I played Madden, I just selected the safety every time and we're
[9072.10s -> 9077.14s]  just running around with them. By the way, I think some of you may have like not been here when I
[9077.14s -> 9081.06s]  talked about how my brother and I used to play and I would lose like a hundred plus points to zero.
[9083.10s -> 9094.44s]  I would just throw Hail Mary's and miss every time. Okay. I think I can back up and recalibrate
[9094.44s -> 9104.22s]  this and just go this way. God, what am I doing? All right. I'm going to go to the right. It looks
[9104.22s -> 9109.74s]  like an opportunity to go to the right side here. No, it doesn't. I'm fucked. I'm just restart the
[9109.74s -> 9121.77s]  game. I have to restart it. There's no coming away from this. I'm never going to get out of here.
[9123.61s -> 9132.34s]  I have to go that way. Waiter. All right. Fine. I'll, I'll get, I'll do it. We're going to,
[9132.34s -> 9136.26s]  I'm going to lose like two, 3000 viewers. I'm going to lose like 10,000 of you, but I'm going
[9136.26s -> 9149.51s]  to go for it. As long as I can turn the wheel. There we go. All right. Keep going. Now if I go
[9149.51s -> 9156.33s]  to the right. Yeah. Okay. This will be all right. I need to pull in a different direction though,
[9156.33s -> 9162.12s]  because I don't want to get too close to this tree. We're going to pull this way. We're going
[9162.12s -> 9164.68s]  to grab one of these trees over here on the right. This one here probably will do it.
[9168.63s -> 9186.71s]  Uh, no, easy. Is it even attached? What is it doing? What does it even attach to? Um, what the
[9186.71s -> 9210.09s]  hell? Pull it. God, let it go. Come here. This one back here. Oh, hold me. No, no, don't. Okay. I'm
[9210.09s -> 9216.30s]  fine. Don't back into that tree. Now we're going to pull it this way. Let it go. I'm going to grab
[9216.30s -> 9221.61s]  this side here. That's closest. This one right here. I'm going to grab this tree back here. Pull
[9221.61s -> 9236.78s]  it. Where'd it go? You're not in reverse. Oh, hold on. I got to grab the tree on the right.
[9247.78s -> 9264.25s]  Come on, dude. Come on. Now we're going to back up. Back up. I'm so screwed here. I don't think this
[9264.25s -> 9279.30s]  is going to happen. The Venga bus is coming. So the poor video game in-game character has not
[9279.30s -> 9291.29s]  eaten and you just have him stuck here. Okay. I obviously can't go that way. I'm going to try
[9291.29s -> 9295.05s]  something different. Oh, that's the definition of insanity is trying the same thing without
[9295.05s -> 9298.97s]  the same results happening. They keep going. You keep doing the same thing with the same results
[9298.97s -> 9321.82s]  happening. All right. I figured it out. I got it. I wasn't in reverse the whole time. Now this
[9321.82s -> 9328.15s]  will make sense. Just wait. I'll get out of this. Don't worry. Everyone can relax. Look, I know you
[9328.15s -> 9332.30s]  guys are making like dinner or something anyways. Hold your residence sleepers till I get out of
[9332.30s -> 9335.50s]  this. Well, actually, no, go ahead. You go to sleep. I'll wake you up. I promise.
[9348.55s -> 9356.30s]  He's just smashing the horn. Stop hitting the horn, dude. I don't know if I can get out of here.
[9356.30s -> 9366.36s]  I don't think I can get out of here. Fuck. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You know what? It's probably
[9366.36s -> 9371.80s]  just going to be easier if I just drive this way. You know what I mean? Like, watch this.
[9373.11s -> 9377.59s]  It's going to be. I'm just going to turn the whole fucking car around. I'm angry at this point.
[9378.23s -> 9397.98s]  Watch this. Ah, ah, ah, ah. Got it. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All
[9397.98s -> 9400.22s]  right. All right. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Don't do anything stupid.
[9400.22s -> 9432.26s]  Here we go. Drive. Oh my God. Drive the car. Boys and girls, we got it. I'm ready. Everything's good
[9432.26s -> 9449.77s]  to go. Here it is. There's our exit right there. Nice and easy. Back it up again. We're still
[9449.77s -> 9473.46s]  fucked. And no, we're not. Look at that straight shot right there. You see it? Here we go. Come on.
[9473.46s -> 9478.44s]  Nice and easy. Just thread, thread, thread, thread, thread. All right. Left or right?
[9479.08s -> 9501.37s]  I'm going to say stay right. Right here. Fuck. There's a tree right there. It's all right.
[9513.50s -> 9526.92s]  It's so close. I did the same thing. Yeah. This time I'm getting out of it because look. Wait,
[9526.92s -> 9531.82s]  I did. I did the same. Oh, no, I didn't. I did the same thing. I went to the same place. No,
[9531.82s -> 9537.80s]  I didn't. I went to the same spot. I went to the same spot. I did go to the exact same spot.
[9537.80s -> 9541.56s]  Oh my God. What are you? You're right. You guys are right. Okay. Holy shit. You're right.
[9542.98s -> 9547.38s]  Oh my God. You got to be kidding me. Okay. I'm done. All right. I'm done. We're going to go this
[9547.38s -> 9555.35s]  way. I don't know how I did that. What an idiot. What a fucking total, just absolute moron. Okay.
[9555.35s -> 9579.50s]  I'm going to try this again. Go this way. Turn the wheels. Come on. Okay. That's this is a
[9579.50s -> 9588.79s]  different path. There we go. I got it. Right. It's right there. I see the road. All right.
[9588.79s -> 9593.59s]  Don't panic. Don't freak out. I think this way is the correct way. Can I fit through that?
[9593.59s -> 9606.86s]  I think I can fit through this. Can I fit through here? I think I can fit right here. Like right
[9606.86s -> 9626.55s]  here. Oh, fuck. Yeah. I'm almost there. Okay. Slow down. What's in front of me? Yeah. Let's go.
[9630.26s -> 9641.48s]  I did it. Thank God. I can finally move on. Oh, it feels so good to get out of that. All right.
[9641.48s -> 9653.86s]  Let's deliver this. Hey, Larry, you were you were like an hour late with the deployment. What
[9653.86s -> 9669.58s]  happened? I had traffic. Oh, yeah. Traffic. I'm in Alaska. There's no cars. All right. Let's go
[9669.58s -> 9686.49s]  tasks. This one here. I got the repair parts. Track it. Let's go. You wasted 40 gallons of fuel.
[9698.07s -> 9701.11s]  Yeah. I want one of those long chickens from Burger King. So bad right now.
[9701.91s -> 9736.14s]  Stay on the road. How many viewers did we lose? A thousand. They were the smart ones. Find all
[9736.14s -> 9755.70s]  the tutorial hints. I know what I'm doing. Okay. Where do you buy the crane? Everyone keeps saying
[9755.70s -> 9786.14s]  I need the crane for some of these other missions. I have a crane. I do. Why do you own a red sex
[9786.14s -> 9795.26s]  t-shirt? Because somebody people made I look it was a reddit thing. I don't know. I have no idea.
[9795.26s -> 9797.98s]  I just somebody linked me a thing where he's like, Oh, look, you're like a serial killer. And I'm
[9797.98s -> 9802.70s]  like, Oh, okay. I laughed for a second. I was like, Oh, ha ha ha. German with a serial killer with
[9802.70s -> 9807.34s]  the AI technology. I woke up the next day is on the front page of every reddit and people thought
[9807.34s -> 9814.84s]  it was a real thing. And everyone just associates me with a fucking like a murderer. That's like
[9814.84s -> 9821.32s]  50,000 upvotes on the front page. It's like I just like to close my phone. I was like, Okay, well,
[9821.32s -> 9830.92s]  I guess we're doing that now. Alright, 1400 bucks, 180. This is now open. So this opens to
[9830.92s -> 9840.68s]  another spot here. But I want to go. I kind of want to do that. Timber. Hi, the sawmill near
[9840.68s -> 9847.48s]  the port is running out of wood. So we'll pay to have some delivered. Log loader crane is recommended.
[9848.04s -> 9859.69s]  I don't have one of those though. I guess that's on the way. So again, explain to me how I get a
[9859.69s -> 9869.19s]  crane because I don't understand. I get it here. Trailer store or something. The other car has a
[9869.19s -> 9890.73s]  crane. Oh, okay. You don't have a crane. I hope the murderer joke at least brought attention to the
[9890.73s -> 9912.34s]  dollhouse stream. No, I don't care. It's funny. Logging missions are kind of hard, my king.
[9913.14s -> 9934.52s]  We'll find out. Is this the sus guy? Join me on the next stream. The imposter is sus guy plays
[9934.52s -> 9952.26s]  werewolf. The imposter is sus guy plays mafia. I don't even play among us. Okay, let's see which
[9952.26s -> 9961.37s]  hat would have which one of these cars has a crane. Alright, so it would say it whichable
[9962.81s -> 9969.38s]  compatibility. How can I tell if it has a crane? I mean, that looks like a crane on top of this.
[9969.38s -> 9986.26s]  If I was a crane, I'd be that thing, the blue thing on top, but we have to mess with it.
[9986.26s -> 9993.86s]  I could buy something now. Can I have 30,000? You know what? Let me take a look because if I sell
[9993.86s -> 10000.46s]  a couple of these, I can get like $50,000. What do I actually need? What should I actually buy? Oh,
[10000.46s -> 10008.36s]  I know exactly what I want. How much is this? I don't have it unlocked. What the hell? That's
[10008.36s -> 10027.05s]  annoying. Alright, let's customize it. Tires are fine. No, no, I want mud. I don't have anything
[10027.05s -> 10036.71s]  unlocked for these. That's not good. What is it currently using? What's the difference? Get the
[10036.71s -> 10053.05s]  freeze. Fine, I guess. Mud pour. That's not good. Okay, well, whatever. Oh, geez. Oh, geez. Alright,
[10053.05s -> 10062.60s]  there's the crane. Is there a better crane? Nah, keep the crane on. That's what I'm using it for.
[10062.60s -> 10091.61s]  I like that. Twisted metal is like missiles. I like that. I like that. I want it to be like a fire
[10091.61s -> 10107.27s]  engine. Yeah, that's better. Alright, cool. Let's go pick up those things. So now how do I use the
[10107.35s -> 10115.99s]  crane? I'm sure we'll find out. Alright, we need to go down here. This is worth like
[10115.99s -> 10122.57s]  three or four thousand dollars or something crazy. This car is way too big to go in the woods,
[10122.57s -> 10134.68s]  so don't worry, I'm not gonna do that. Let's go this way. I'm gonna have to just kind of go around
[10134.68s -> 10141.48s]  here and up this way, I guess. It's really the only way I can really go besides here, but is
[10141.48s -> 10150.71s]  this water? I don't think I can drive through this. That's definitely the better way to go,
[10150.71s -> 10158.07s]  but I don't know how deep that is. Is it ice or water? Let's try it. I'll give it a try.
[10158.07s -> 10169.37s]  This thing's terrible in mud. We'll find out. I'm gonna turn around if I don't want it.
[10169.93s -> 10179.96s]  I don't want to do it. That's a scary horn. That's the kind of horn that makes you just
[10179.96s -> 10187.24s]  jump at the red light. That's the kind of horn that gives you a stomach ache. It's just so st-
[10190.87s -> 10202.74s]  shit. It's okay. Is it ice or is it water? It looks like- I don't know. What? It's ice? Alright,
[10202.74s -> 10220.41s]  it's ice. I'll be alright. I have no control over this car. I just held left on the stick as hard
[10220.41s -> 10254.06s]  as I could. Oh lord, hold on. Wait, this is always on? This is ice. That's fine. Face cam,
[10254.06s -> 10264.81s]  good sir. You've earned five minutes of face cam. I'm gonna have to blink my eyes a bunch.
[10264.81s -> 10278.22s]  What a great time to turn it on when I'm like- I just realized I haven't blinked in an hour
[10278.22s -> 10287.69s]  and my eyes are watering. Yeah, my eyes are full of water right now. Anybody else have really
[10287.69s -> 10293.13s]  watery, liquidy eyes? My eyes seem to be so watery all the time. If I go outside and it's windy out,
[10294.55s -> 10302.70s]  at all, tears will just be streaming down my face, down my cheeks. I've got very sensitive
[10302.70s -> 10325.45s]  eyes. Pinching your nipples helps with- I'm not even gonna finish the sentence. I think I can-
[10325.45s -> 10332.89s]  no, keep it on. I don't wanna get stuck. No, I don't need to. It's not that deep. This thing's
[10332.89s -> 10342.66s]  pretty good in off mud terrain. You're a lizard. You just lick them. I am like a lizard mouth. I'm
[10342.66s -> 10349.82s]  always like kind of moistening my lips. I'm always going like this. I always bite my lip and I was
[10349.82s -> 10359.75s]  like like this. If I could lick my eyes with my tongue, I probably would do it. It'd be like-
[10361.11s -> 10375.26s]  happened all the time. Capstick Charlie, yeah. We're getting there. I'm not going that way.
[10376.20s -> 10398.07s]  You're a fucking freak. Hey, I still don't have any gray hairs. Not that that like means anything
[10398.07s -> 10402.23s]  for what you just said. I don't know why. I was like flexing on you for some reason. Like,
[10402.23s -> 10405.43s]  oh yeah. Well, you ever think of a freak? I don't have any gray- I don't know. It didn't really
[10405.43s -> 10413.50s]  correlate together, but whatever. I turn 36 really soon and I don't have any gray hairs.
[10414.14s -> 10422.97s]  You dye your hair. I don't dye my hair. I'm afraid of dying my hair. I feel like it's gonna fall out.
[10435.53s -> 10444.30s]  What about one? It already is falling out. Yeah, I know it is. It is. I can't stop that. It's called
[10444.30s -> 10450.44s]  age. All the garlic and radishes. Don't eat too much garlic. Don't eat too many radishes.
[10451.08s -> 10453.45s]  Only eat them when you feel like you want a snack.
[10456.30s -> 10462.18s]  Don't do the YouTuber quirky hair color thing. I- I'm not gonna do the YouTuber
[10462.18s -> 10466.98s]  quirky hair color thing. Don't worry. I'm not gonna do like the hair color YouTuber thing.
[10472.58s -> 10480.90s]  Garlic snack? Yeah, well not- maybe not nowadays, but like, I don't know,
[10480.90s -> 10485.38s]  George Washington used to like rub garlic on his feet to like cure his fucking cold.
[10486.18s -> 10494.07s]  You know, you know, garlic has something called allicin in it. It's actually really good for you.
[10494.07s -> 10498.31s]  When you crush garlic and it stinks, you're actually smelling the chemical reaction to
[10498.31s -> 10507.10s]  create allicin. It's very, very good for you. Hey, look it up. That's fine. It's all right.
[10507.10s -> 10511.10s]  I'll be the smartest one in the room today. Maybe not every day, but maybe today I will be.
[10516.73s -> 10526.55s]  No, A-L-I-C-I-N. Not like A-L-I-S-O-N. That's suedo science. It's not. It's like documented
[10526.55s -> 10541.90s]  fucking proof. All right, let's go. You went to the wrong place? No, I didn't. Yeah, I did.
[10542.70s -> 10557.02s]  Do I need a crane to pick up the logs? Timber. Log loader crane is recommended. All right,
[10557.02s -> 10601.96s]  well let's- I'm gonna get them I guess. Let's pick them up. What? Okay. All right. Anchor. Okay. How
[10601.96s -> 10635.40s]  do I pick it up? Attach cargo. How do I attach it? Pick it up. Attach cargo. It's the wrong crane.
[10635.40s -> 10641.83s]  Whatever. I need a logging crane for the logs. Fine. I'm just gonna go do the- I'm gonna-
[10642.47s -> 10664.15s]  We were talking and so I didn't pay attention. Back on the road. Let's go. Come on. Get fired?
[10664.15s -> 10682.44s]  I'm not. Put this shit away. I'm gonna fix your shit. I just did. How do you drive with
[10682.44s -> 10698.14s]  passengers in the car without getting lost? That's what GPS is for. Garlic's really good for you
[10698.14s -> 10706.34s]  though. I would say you should add some more- Well, hold on. I'll hit this thing. Garlic is very,
[10706.34s -> 10712.55s]  very harsh for some people. You know, if you have acid reflux problems, if you're trying to do like
[10712.55s -> 10717.59s]  kind of like a low FODMAP diet, if you have irritable bowel kind of problems, you don't
[10717.59s -> 10721.75s]  really want to eat too much of it. But if you can handle it, it's really, really good for you.
[10731.64s -> 10742.76s]  It's for vampires. They have a garlic burger at Burger King. I don't think I want that. I want-
[10742.76s -> 10749.19s]  I like fresh garlic. Garlic that's fresh, smashed, and immediately used either to put in the pan
[10749.19s -> 10757.19s]  or like garlic bread or something. I don't- No. Give me the real stuff. I want the real stuff. I
[10757.19s -> 10762.18s]  don't want the fake shit. I'm not saying that it's fake whatever they use at Burger King or
[10762.18s -> 10765.94s]  whatever, but it's not the real shit. It doesn't- They don't smash it in the fucking restaurant.
[10767.16s -> 10777.32s]  What happened? Why don't you grow fresh garlic? I don't know. I never really thought to.
[10778.04s -> 10794.87s]  I'm not saying it's fake. I'm just saying it's not real. No, I just- It's not- It's real. It's not
[10794.87s -> 10800.07s]  fresh. Fresh squeezed, fresh pressed at the restaurant. Like somebody just smashes it
[10800.07s -> 10803.11s]  with a knife and like smashes it with a knife. You know, you turn the knife sideways and you
[10803.11s -> 10806.39s]  smash. Spread, spread, spread, spread, smash. Spread, spread, spread, spread, spread.
[10806.39s -> 10809.99s]  Sink, sink, sink, sink, smash. Spread, spread, spread. You know what I'm talking about?
[10809.99s -> 10817.53s]  That's what I do. Where are we going? All right. Don't be an idiot. All right. I gotta go right.
[10817.53s -> 10835.54s]  Hey, watch the road, buddy. I'm fine. This is the second time I've heard you rant about garlic
[10835.54s -> 10841.21s]  because I find it to be an incredibly important addition to your diet. Your armpits smell like
[10841.21s -> 10847.29s]  garlic. They do. All of you- Okay. Here's the thing. Garlic like permeates every inch of your
[10847.29s -> 10852.89s]  body. It like crosses your like brain barrier and it like goes through all your pores, right?
[10853.61s -> 10858.65s]  From what I've read. I don't know how true it is. So that's- If you eat garlic, you smell like
[10858.65s -> 10869.48s]  garlic. Especially if you eat a lot of it. Don't eat too much of it. Don't eat too much. You shouldn't
[10869.48s -> 10886.39s]  be eating too much of it anyways. This dude's got garlic brain? That's what I've heard. Garlic just
[10886.39s -> 10891.83s]  permeates like every single like cell in your body. You become more garlic than person when you eat
[10891.83s -> 10903.03s]  it. It's garlic science. It's suede of science. I don't know. Let me just pick up my boxes. Okay.
[10903.03s -> 10921.56s]  Here we go. Activate anchor. Get that crane out. Catch the crane. All right. Lift it up. Why is-
[10921.56s -> 10928.20s]  Why am I moving? Why am I moving? Anchor, anchor, anchor, anchor, anchor in the ground. Anchor. Let
[10928.20s -> 10942.52s]  it go. What's happening? What's wrong with me? Put the handbrake on? Oh shit. You're right. Okay.
[10952.94s -> 10991.06s]  How do I get this in the bed? I can only put one of these at a time? Can I stack them? Oh my god.
[10992.26s -> 11019.67s]  I don't even know where this is going. Just fucking sleep. Thank you. Actually that's better. I can
[11019.67s -> 11042.66s]  get it right in the middle. Okay. Can I drop it now? Wait. Lower it down. It's almost in there.
[11042.66s -> 11053.35s]  All right. That's in. That's in. All right. There's one. Nice. Okay. Let's get the other one.
[11053.35s -> 11077.45s]  How high can I lift this? Let's see how high I can get this first. That can go pretty high actually.
[11077.45s -> 11123.58s]  This might work. It's kind of hard to tell which direction. Okay. No. There we go. That's better.
[11123.58s -> 11147.05s]  Almost there. It's actually on. Don't. Garlic brain. The fucking face cam's staying on fine.
[11147.05s -> 11187.70s]  How's that for garlic brain motherfuckers? How's that for garlic brain motherfuckers? D. Where's
[11187.70s -> 11218.07s]  this going? Where's this going? Where does it go? What mission is this? Bottom left? Log station? No,
[11218.07s -> 11222.09s]  no. That's not the right one. Deliver to the sawmill. Medium logs. Why is that being tracked?
[11222.09s -> 11232.74s]  I don't want that. It's the wrong one. It was like it was up at the garage. Yep. Okay. Here it is.
[11232.74s -> 11238.22s]  No, it's not. What was it? There it is. Okay. Here it is. Here. Here. Here. Containers in the river.
[11238.22s -> 11248.10s]  Okay. So I need to get over here. Back out to the road. If I pulled this off,
[11248.10s -> 11279.99s]  this is a huge deal for me. Get off. Get off. No more. I didn't think it was going to happen
[11279.99s -> 11291.48s]  immediately. No. I was so ready. Wait. God damn it. I was like, if I was slow, if I was actually slow
[11291.48s -> 11299.61s]  enough, I was just not centered. God damn it. I'm so pissed. I can't believe it. It's because I
[11299.61s -> 11303.13s]  turned the face cam off. Yeah. Cause I was like, so I don't want to even look at me. Don't look at my
[11303.13s -> 11309.83s]  face. Nobody look at me. Nobody look at me. Nobody look at me. Who is that? That's a character from
[11309.83s -> 11318.89s]  like a Christmas show. What is that? I was sleeping in my class in broad daylight. That's from Heart
[11318.89s -> 11323.29s]  of Darkness. Heart of Darkness video that I made. It was a, it might as well be. Yeah. That's what
[11323.29s -> 11334.44s]  it is. I'm so mad that I have to do this. I'm so pissed. I really thought I was going to be able
[11334.44s -> 11340.86s]  to do it. And you got like a Mario's ass went into the fire sound effect too. Great. Okay. Well,
[11342.06s -> 11355.42s]  I guess we're going to recover. Aye, aye, aye. Just leave Alaska. No, I have to do that.
[11358.41s -> 11361.77s]  I'm going to get these because like, I'm not going to let it just fucking beat me. I'm sorry.
[11370.74s -> 11383.58s]  Sleeping in my class in broad daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight. There it is. Enable aye,
[11383.58s -> 11395.94s]  aye, aye. Is it like 2017 again? Like is it 2016? What are you talking about? Oh, this is actually
[11395.94s -> 11404.15s]  really important. Have I, have I ever done the record scratch Aaron thing? I've been working on
[11404.15s -> 11425.46s]  it for a while. So I've done it, right? I have. Yep. Good. All right. Just making sure. If you're
[11425.46s -> 11433.32s]  going to play No More Heroes 3, aye, aye, aye is crucial. It's not. Yes, I didn't. I feel like I
[11433.32s -> 11463.82s]  did. You haven't. I haven't? Someone that goes. I've never done that. Well, now I have. So now you
[11463.82s -> 11471.40s]  can remember it. You've done that before. I'm sure I have. Yeah. What are you guys talking about?
[11472.04s -> 11477.35s]  Remember, you don't have to spend a hundred thousand dollars to entertain us.
[11484.46s -> 11524.82s]  Well, about that. You got the price wrong. That was a dad laugh. I said this in the pre-stream
[11524.82s -> 11531.22s]  and I'll say it again. It's, it's not about how much money a stream costs. It's, is it fun to do?
[11531.22s -> 11537.00s]  Is it worth trying? I don't care if I spend a hundred dollars for a stream or a hundred million
[11537.00s -> 11544.81s]  dollars. As long as it's an idea that I think is fun or that I want to do and I'm stuck. It doesn't
[11544.81s -> 11553.61s]  matter. Look, if I can do it, I'll try. Right? I don't care. I actually am stuck though. I just
[11553.61s -> 11582.20s]  realizing. Okay. I'm going to have to winch. Come on. This sucks. There we go. This was a horrible
[11582.20s -> 11592.52s]  way to go. I, dollhouse friends is going to be living in my head rent free for years. Well,
[11593.16s -> 11596.76s]  that makes me happy. Well, not that it's like, I don't know, living in your head rent free is
[11596.76s -> 11604.23s]  like a, isn't that like a, don't you not want that? Um, I don't know. If you thought it was fun,
[11604.23s -> 11612.84s]  then that makes me happy. That's all I care about. I really mean that. I'd like to get out of the
[11612.84s -> 11626.78s]  mud though. I'm so close. All right. Pull myself up with this. What the hell are you doing? Come on.
[11626.78s -> 11639.90s]  I'm going the right way, right? Okay. Why? This was such a dumb way. I was driving. Whatever. Just go.
[11645.00s -> 11650.14s]  Don't be modest. You knew it was going to be a great stream. That's it. You watched the behind
[11650.14s -> 11657.85s]  the scenes show yesterday. That's not necessarily guaranteed. It could have been very bad. It could
[11657.85s -> 11664.52s]  have been a disaster. We could have had extension problems. We could have had, because we were doing
[11664.52s -> 11669.80s]  it for three days. Is it going to still be even interesting after the first day? There was a lot
[11669.80s -> 11687.21s]  of potential for it to not really be that fun. Yeah. It could have been awful. So did I think
[11687.21s -> 11696.38s]  it was going to be worth doing? Absolutely. Everybody involved was so into it. That's how
[11696.38s -> 11701.67s]  you know that the project is probably a good idea. When every single person that's working on it is
[11701.67s -> 11706.17s]  like, this is really fun. Like we were having, we were actually, we were all having a lot of fun
[11706.89s -> 11715.51s]  during that week and the weeks before too. So if, as long as what some of you guys got out of that
[11715.51s -> 11719.83s]  stream was, you thought it was interesting. You thought it was fun. You had a good time
[11719.83s -> 11724.39s]  participating and everybody on the crew and the set had a good time too. That's, that's a win for
[11724.39s -> 11735.59s]  me. And I really hope to do way more stuff like that in the future too. That, that, but there's
[11735.59s -> 11738.63s]  no, I want to make this really clear, kind of how I started this part of the conversation.
[11739.27s -> 11745.67s]  I don't ever want people to think, holy shit, the dollhouse. Oh man, he's gonna have to do
[11745.67s -> 11752.63s]  something even bigger than that next time. That's kind of not the goal. There will be huge projects
[11752.63s -> 11759.05s]  like that. Maybe like, hopefully I try to do go to once or twice a year, but there's other stuff
[11759.05s -> 11762.65s]  that does not have to be that scale that I really want to do that I think would be fun to do.
[11763.37s -> 11769.91s]  Like I've said before, I might just call Jake like tomorrow and be like, hey, uh, I kind of want to,
[11769.91s -> 11773.03s]  what's going on in a couple of weeks? You want to do something? I have this idea.
[11773.59s -> 11781.40s]  It doesn't have to be in an elaborate, huge production, right? All right, let's try this
[11781.40s -> 11791.99s]  again. And we, we had significant backing from Twitch and from Coinbase. And I would like for
[11791.99s -> 11796.63s]  those, I mean, if it's possible, right? And I think you can't, you know, I hope that continues,
[11797.59s -> 11803.35s]  but if I can get the capital and get the funding and the money to be able to do stuff like that,
[11803.35s -> 11808.25s]  you're going to see stuff like that way more than you, way more often. If I can,
[11808.89s -> 11830.22s]  are you doing better medically? Oh, sure. Let's, uh, because now I can kind of just relax and we
[11830.22s -> 11833.10s]  can talk about this very briefly and I'm going to fall over again into the fucking water.
[11834.06s -> 11838.46s]  Uh, the medical thing that I was talking about, like a week before the stream was actually really,
[11838.46s -> 11846.78s]  really annoying. Uh, something I have to deal with now. Um, so it was a very stressful week leading
[11846.78s -> 11852.28s]  up to the dollhouse stream, not just because the dollhouse stream was happening, but, um,
[11852.28s -> 11858.89s]  I started to get dizzy and feel like pressure in my head. And it was like, don't even fucking tell
[11858.89s -> 11865.90s]  me this is something else that's going to start here. Uh, so I had to go in and get like an MRI
[11865.90s -> 11874.68s]  of my head. This is literally four or five days before the show. And thankfully there was nothing
[11874.68s -> 11885.29s]  really majorly wrong, but I have, um, cysts in my sinuses and I guess that can potentially cause
[11885.85s -> 11891.14s]  the problems that I was having. So I have to get those removed. So I have to go to like an ENT
[11891.14s -> 11899.03s]  and actually get some type of surgery, I think, to remove them. And they were not there before
[11899.03s -> 11901.43s]  because those of you that have been keeping up with the channel for a long time, at least the
[11901.43s -> 11907.19s]  last year or two, I had a brain and head MRI because of the unrelated other problem, right?
[11907.19s -> 11914.81s]  Like a year ago. And that, they, that, this was not there a year ago. So this is new. So I have
[11914.81s -> 11918.33s]  to just kind of go in and I was essentially told, yeah, you're going to have to go to an ENT and
[11918.33s -> 11922.71s]  they're going to have to get a better look. And I'm just probably going to have to get them removed.
[11922.71s -> 11928.12s]  So apparently it's very, very simple. It's a thankfully very easy thing to do.
[11929.14s -> 11932.50s]  And I'm not like in any pain or anything like this. Don't, don't get me wrong. I'm, I'm fine
[11932.50s -> 11940.76s]  completely. It was just, I think it's like putting weird pressure in my sinuses. So yeah, but I want
[11940.76s -> 11944.20s]  to kind of give you guys sort of what was going on there. Cause it was kind of, I was just kind
[11944.20s -> 11949.00s]  of weird. I'm just like, Oh yeah, I can't stream for like a week. Sorry. I got like an unrelated
[11949.00s -> 11953.00s]  other issue going on. And people were kind of like, what the fuck are we, what, what are you
[11953.00s -> 11959.59s]  talking about? What, what now? So let me clear the air on that, that like I'm fine. But I do have,
[11961.16s -> 11967.56s]  they're called like maxillary, they have an insane like five syllable name. It's like
[11969.96s -> 11976.68s]  something about maximiliterally sinus. Wait, let me, let me see what it is. Max, what's it called?
[11976.68s -> 11991.70s]  Maximus. Somebody knows what it is. Mucus retention cysts in your maxima. Yeah, there you go.
[11992.18s -> 12007.22s]  Max of the maxillary maxillary sinus retention cyst. There you are. It's a, it's a mouthful. Yeah.
[12007.22s -> 12025.27s]  Bro, no offense, but your, your body is making me angry. Yeah, me too. I'll be honest, but yeah,
[12025.27s -> 12029.82s]  I'm good. Don't worry. I'm going to be probably going in next week to see an ENT. We're just going
[12029.82s -> 12042.20s]  to just get rid of them. And then those problems will probably go away. Maximus. All right. Let me
[12042.20s -> 12049.82s]  get back to this. It's definitely not the garlic. He's still going to have the hernia surgery.
[12049.82s -> 12056.98s]  Probably. Yeah. Just to see if it fixes anything or helps anything. I forgot how to play the game.
[12056.98s -> 12063.46s]  How do I play the game? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is going to be bad if I don't.
[12063.46s -> 12071.83s]  Did I, this is not going to happen again, is it? I think it is. I'm, oh no, this is going to happen
[12071.83s -> 12088.46s]  again. Wait, put this, put this away. Take it easy. What happened? What happened? How does it?
[12089.02s -> 12096.10s]  Hernia, hernia, Andy, Andy. Why do I say that like that? What's wrong with my voice?
[12096.74s -> 12111.67s]  Hernia, Andy. That scared the shit out of me. And I pressed it. All right. Pull me out, please.
[12118.86s -> 12125.99s]  What the fuck? I'm about to just say who cares about this mission? Cause now I can't do anything.
[12125.99s -> 12142.50s]  I have to attach the this and spin me around. Oh my God. I'm going over. Oh no, no, no, no, no,
[12142.50s -> 12154.30s]  no, no, no. Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me. I didn't, I'm not coming back here again.
[12155.82s -> 12179.83s]  I'm not coming back here. Get the fuck out of here. Come on. Stay up. No, stay up, stay up,
[12179.83s -> 12198.17s]  stay up. It's like a giant kickstand. Stay up. Come on. Am I up? I am. All right. I'll go into
[12198.17s -> 12239.54s]  the fucking water, please. Okay. Well that was annoying. Galaxy brain. Top gamer moment of 2021.
[12239.54s -> 12248.18s]  No, I think getting out of the forest deserves that slot. So I got a question about No More Heroes 3.
[12248.18s -> 12253.62s]  I've been really anticipating that game for a few years now. Is it good? Be honest with me. I need
[12253.62s -> 12261.37s]  to know. I need to know if it's good. Is it good? I'm not reading reviews on it. I don't want to
[12261.37s -> 12269.18s]  know anything about it. Besides, is it good? Is it good? It's fucking amazing. I've heard it was good.
[12269.18s -> 12280.33s]  Okay. That's great. Perhaps. No mega low ups and downs, but it's good because I heard it was long.
[12280.89s -> 12299.99s]  All right. Is that in there? Not really. Shit. All right. Move. Just turn it. Oh my God. Put it
[12299.99s -> 12320.71s]  down. Come on. Can I just tilt it in there so it slides in? All right. Well, handbrake. Come on.
[12321.27s -> 12326.38s]  You should play Travis Strikes again. The only reason why I didn't want to play Travis Strikes
[12326.38s -> 12333.56s]  again is because I heard that game was even longer. And it's like a top-down game, right?
[12334.28s -> 12353.59s]  Isn't Travis Strikes again like 30 hours? I don't know if I want to do that. Come on.
[12359.37s -> 12364.12s]  That was awful. I can't do that three and a half hours into the stream after talking.
[12364.12s -> 12369.64s]  That was really bad. Oh yeah. You can oof. That was an oof. It was horrible.
[12375.35s -> 12396.02s]  Do we go for the other one? Come on. Let's do it. Let's go. How do I actually move this thing down?
[12396.66s -> 12402.14s]  All right. Yeah. Yeah. You're right. You're right. No. Stop. Stop. You're right. Turn it off.
[12402.70s -> 12420.20s]  I'm leaving. Now we're going to go this way. Straight ahead. Bang the left. Okay. Be careful.
[12420.20s -> 12424.20s]  Pack. Pack the bloody cargo. Pack the bloody cargo. Pack the bloody cargo.
[12426.28s -> 12445.90s]  Oh shit. I can do that. All right. I packed the bloody cargo. This thing's really heavy.
[12461.21s -> 12472.39s]  All right. Easy. There's no way I would have been able to do two. Not a chance. This mission sucks.
[12472.39s -> 12476.71s]  How much money do I even get? Like three grand? It seems like not enough for how annoying this is.
[12476.71s -> 12516.12s]  It just says you suck. I like that. I like that person. If you listen to Donda, I, I,
[12516.76s -> 12534.58s]  oy, oy, oy, oy. Handbrake. Handbrake. Handbrake. Handbrake. Handbrake. Oh God. All right. We're
[12534.58s -> 12548.15s]  good. I have not. Let's, I'm just going to attach the winch. I'm not going to, no bullshit here.
[12548.15s -> 12571.67s]  Pull it. Why is this breaking? Stop breaking the trees. You idiot. This shit's too heavy. I can't
[12571.67s -> 12586.71s]  do this. God. I can't, you know, I was supposed to upgrade my cars before I did this. That's
[12586.71s -> 12610.04s]  absolutely sure. Come on. Come on then. Come on then. It's too heavy. It's just too heavy. It's
[12610.04s -> 12618.71s]  too heavy. Now I'm in a lot of trouble. Now what do I do? I'm just going to have to pull myself
[12618.71s -> 12626.63s]  the whole way. All wheel drive. All wheel drive I think is on by default on this one. All right.
[12626.63s -> 12635.80s]  There we go. I'm all right. Come on. You can get through. Am I going to play No More Heroes 3 all
[12635.80s -> 12645.24s]  the way through? That's the plan. We'll see though. This weekend when I start it, we're going to do
[12645.24s -> 12651.67s]  probably Friday, Saturday or Saturday, Sunday. Keep an eye on the sus. You'll see. And after that,
[12651.67s -> 12656.87s]  I'll see how far I am. If I have another stream's worth, I would just try to finish it the next day
[12656.87s -> 12663.40s]  or a few days later or something. And then we do have the Sims 3 mod hell that I had actually
[12663.40s -> 12671.19s]  all ready to go before Dollhouse. But I didn't want to be a, I didn't want to just do the Sims
[12671.19s -> 12680.66s]  only for like a month. So that's ready to go. Wait, he actually is the sus guy. Thank you.
[12681.91s -> 12695.77s]  That's right. Okay. I love that person had to search for that. They looked it up. They were
[12695.77s -> 12707.56s]  like, wait a minute. No way. Did I, did I just get that person star struck? Are you? Can you believe
[12707.56s -> 12744.57s]  it? That's right. It's me. Uh, how do I unload this? Be with a face. I, it's not even my face.
[12744.57s -> 12758.71s]  How do I attach the card? Unpack card. How do I get rid of this? What? I have to, I can't,
[12758.71s -> 12800.02s]  I need both of them attached? No, I don't. Better not. Is it all right? Name's Pete. I work for a
[12800.02s -> 12804.34s]  transit company called Alaskan Transit. We've had an unfortunate accident is drilling containers of
[12804.34s -> 12814.84s]  tools stuck in the river. Can you locate them and get them to the base? Deliver to the port.
[12814.84s -> 12830.44s]  Fuck you. This is so far away. Oh, fuck you. Really? This is so, this is not worth this,
[12830.44s -> 12860.34s]  but three grand. Well, I have to put this back in now. God. Ah, do both, do both trailer trailer.
[12860.34s -> 12864.07s]  I don't think I can get a trailer in there. This engine that's in this car.
[12864.07s -> 12868.63s]  See how slow I was. I'm going to get stuck in that little weird spot where I was stuck before.
[12880.73s -> 12892.20s]  No, it's been the other way. Spin the other way. Turn, turn the other way. Oh, I'm getting that
[12892.20s -> 12896.04s]  like antsy. I'm just like wanting to shake and stuff. You know what I mean? You forget that.
[12896.04s -> 12916.76s]  I just want to start shaking around. Oh, okay. I could have just done that. Really? I don't want
[12916.76s -> 12930.68s]  to deliver this all the way to the port. That sucks. All right. First thing somebody puts in chat
[12930.68s -> 12941.10s]  is what I'm going to eat. And it better be burger king, long chicken sandwich, soy. No, nevermind.
[13035.72s -> 13042.06s]  Hi. Hello. How are you? Sorry about that. We should be good to go.
[13044.71s -> 13053.11s]  I'm going to need a refresh chat though. This chat crashed. I'd like a chat refresh. Clear chat.
[13053.75s -> 13078.82s]  Yeah, that was, that was my fault. That was my fault. Give me one sec. There you are. Okay.
[13081.51s -> 13090.66s]  What did you do? Uh, my VPN was on and I had it on a, I had it on a bad, um,
[13091.22s -> 13097.78s]  I had it on a server I shouldn't have been on. That was my fault. Sorry about that.
[13098.42s -> 13102.14s]  Oh my fucking God. Don't tell me that that's going to ruin everything.
[13103.80s -> 13119.83s]  No, I'm good. He did pirate the game. What does that mean? That means that some VP,
[13119.83s -> 13125.69s]  I thought that was on fire. Uh, some VPN service can get like junkie, especially at certain times
[13125.69s -> 13130.49s]  of day, certain times of night. And I was on one of the ones that was junkie. So that was my own
[13130.49s -> 13140.17s]  fault. New objective. Can I not go across this bridge? Oh, come on. What? How am I supposed to
[13140.17s -> 13155.46s]  get to the port if I can't go? How am I supposed to get over there? I can't go. Oh, are you serious?
[13156.39s -> 13163.38s]  I think I can drive over that. I'm just going to have to leave this here. All right. They stay,
[13163.38s -> 13169.51s]  it's permanent. So I'm just going to unpack it and leave it here. That's why you take the scout
[13169.51s -> 13174.97s]  first. Yeah, I know that you're right. I'm starting to understand how the game is played now.
[13174.97s -> 13178.66s]  You don't just drive around with the big guns. You have to take the little guy.
[13181.69s -> 13190.39s]  You got to go take your, um, hold on. I swear I'll make a reference in a few seconds when I
[13190.39s -> 13199.86s]  figure out how to get my fingers out of my eyeballs, like the Humvee in red alert.
[13200.42s -> 13204.76s]  You just drive around with it. Who cares if that car explodes. You're looking for where their bases
[13205.48s -> 13220.65s]  there. Okay. I got it out. Don't not. Oh my God. What the fuck are you talking about?
[13220.65s -> 13233.61s]  Why did you just die? Why did the engine stall? I'm all right. Give me the scout. I'm just going
[13233.61s -> 13250.81s]  to drive around the scout. At least I got the cargo out. All right. Give me, give me like,
[13250.81s -> 13259.83s]  just give me this thing. I'm going out with the truck. Let's go. This thing on all wheel drive
[13259.83s -> 13274.54s]  and let's fucking just hammer it. Let's move. I'm going to drive. I feel like I haven't completed
[13274.54s -> 13283.86s]  a mission in like an hour. Um, can I take it this way? I'm going up. Yeah, we'll go. I'm going this
[13283.86s -> 13293.86s]  way. Let's take the little scenic drive here and just see what we find. I'm just going to take a
[13293.86s -> 13308.42s]  little drive. Let's go. Plenty of gas. I'm ready. I just looked over and said I was live for four
[13308.42s -> 13313.54s]  minutes and I was like, how is that possible? I actually thought I was only live for four minutes.
[13314.26s -> 13326.06s]  It's like I am on drugs. What do you, how is that possible? No way. Because I've been live for about
[13326.06s -> 13352.74s]  four hours and it says four minutes. It's like, is my concept of time just ruined forever? I feel
[13352.74s -> 13362.15s]  like I'm really going to get into No More Heroes 3. It says three hours and 43 minutes for me.
[13362.87s -> 13388.42s]  I got to get those chain tires for real. We politely say what his shirt says. Uh,
[13388.42s -> 13410.68s]  this is a shirt from, uh, Omega Mart, the Meow Wolf exhibit in Vegas here. Omega Lul Mart. Yes,
[13410.68s -> 13433.90s]  I knew of course. Is it as awesome as it looks? Yes. I can safely tell you that this is, there's a
[13433.90s -> 13442.95s]  Meow Wolf in like three or four different cities. It absolutely is worth it. It's amazing. I'm not
[13442.95s -> 13446.71s]  going to say anything. I don't want to talk about it because there's a lot of interesting things
[13446.71s -> 13453.03s]  going on when you do it, but it was really, really cool. Really. What the flying fuck, dude. I can't
[13453.03s -> 13470.52s]  go anywhere. A rock slide? What do you mean a rock slide? Time for you to suit up and save the day.
[13470.52s -> 13497.38s]  I'm going around it. Now what? Rock obstacle. A shipment of cargo. Oh, oh, oh, nevermind. I
[13497.38s -> 13503.26s]  thought I just could, I thought I couldn't go around it. For some reason I thought it was like,
[13503.26s -> 13518.79s]  you can't go around. Sorry. No more swearing. Okay, fine. I won't. I promise. Can we say what
[13518.79s -> 13524.23s]  the shirt says? Not where you got it from. The shirt says thank you a bunch of times. Here, look.
[13524.23s -> 13542.36s]  I mean it's flipped, but here I'll flip it for you. Shirt says thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[13542.36s -> 13547.40s]  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And then there's a image of the Omega Mart.
[13547.40s -> 13560.22s]  I like the shirt and think it looks good. I'm not going to do the sus face.
[13570.34s -> 13576.63s]  I'm sorry to really break everybody's magic here. The sus face is a computer generated image. That's
[13576.63s -> 13586.55s]  not even my face. It's my eyes and hair. And the rest is a weird stretched out CGI or something.
[13589.54s -> 13603.19s]  What's this? Gas over there and factory that way too. Oh, shit. There is a, okay, there's a tower
[13603.19s -> 13621.83s]  over here. Let's see if I can get the tower. Oh, this looks like a clock. I definitely don't want
[13621.83s -> 13630.57s]  to do this. Contest. People say you're one of the best drivers around. Maybe, maybe not. How about
[13630.57s -> 13645.93s]  a little challenge to see if you can beat my record? Okay. Reach point A. Oh my god. Um,
[13646.57s -> 13678.54s]  okay. Hold on. Uh, I guess I'll, let's go. What, what, how much time do I have? How am I supposed
[13678.54s -> 13699.78s]  to get up there? Do I turn my headlights on? What's, what's headlights? Fuck my eyes. Dude,
[13699.78s -> 13709.42s]  you can't do this. No, you, nobody can. This is impossible. I need a moped. I really don't think
[13709.42s -> 13723.66s]  I can do this. No, I don't, whatever. I think I can, I think I can count the whole time. I don't
[13723.66s -> 13749.19s]  care. I was wondering if you were ever going to eat a big hot dog on stream. You want to hear one
[13749.19s -> 13753.11s]  of the stream ideas that never happened. That would have been maybe funny for like maybe five
[13753.11s -> 13758.98s]  minutes. I wanted to do an eating contest of like steaks or hot dogs or whatever.
[13759.54s -> 13767.77s]  Be like a Coney Island thing. And the only reason why I thought it was funny is one of the contestants
[13768.57s -> 13774.09s]  has a fork and knife and is eating it really slowly. He's just enjoying like a dinner and he
[13774.09s -> 13787.22s]  eats just one. That was it. Don't get stuck. Don't get stuck. Don't get stuck. Don't get stuck. Don't
[13787.22s -> 13798.70s]  get stuck. Don't get stuck. Don't get stuck. Um, it's over. I'm stuck. Maybe not. Hold on. I'm almost
[13798.70s -> 13807.35s]  through it. Come on. We're going to go muddin. Come on. That's an actual family guy joke.
[13808.49s -> 13813.91s]  That probably is. I didn't do it. Obviously. Like I just was like, nah, nevermind.
[13813.91s -> 13824.90s]  That's a TikTok skit. Were you guys around when I said that I thought I think I'd be huge on TikTok
[13826.68s -> 13841.03s]  if I gave it really an effort? I think I would be the biggest thing on TikTok
[13841.03s -> 13849.21s]  ever. Like if you rewind the clock and I just started and it's like 10 years ago, but it's now
[13849.21s -> 13855.21s]  and I'm like 22, 23, 24, 25, I would be the number one most subscribed person on TikTok.
[13855.21s -> 13875.85s]  Guaranteed. Guaranteed. What an ego. No, I was just saying, you know, the, look at the, you know,
[13875.85s -> 13881.10s]  the dances I could do. The dances. Imagine me coming out with a new dance every week.
[13882.76s -> 13899.08s]  You don't think I'd be number one in the world? Travel to mountain river. Holy shit. Wait a minute.
[13899.08s -> 13905.37s]  This is a new zone. Okay. Maybe not the biggest thing in the world,
[13905.37s -> 13912.33s]  but I would be at least the most subscribed. I'd be the most subscribed person on TikTok
[13912.33s -> 13915.21s]  from like people in New Hampshire or something. You know what I mean? Like I'd have something.
[13915.21s -> 13922.41s]  I'd have that. I'd be able to claim that. New zone. Wait, this isn't a new zone.
[13922.41s -> 13941.42s]  Show us a dance right now to prove it. No, I can't show you a dance right now to prove it
[13941.42s -> 13951.82s]  because I don't have pants on. Restore the bridge, right? I'm just taking quests every time I see
[13951.82s -> 13961.14s]  anyone. Wait, hold on. I just need to know. Like, can I, can a car, can I explode this car?
[13961.14s -> 13976.86s]  I don't think I can even drive through this. 250 million off the debt if you make a TikTok.
[13976.86s -> 13988.42s]  No, make it way more than that. It needs to be way more than that. Nope. Nope. This is low ball
[13988.42s -> 14000.68s]  bullshit. I will agree to creating a TikTok and making one TikTok a week for the next,
[14001.32s -> 14008.10s]  well, starting, no, no, I literally don't feel like doing that right now. Starting like next week.
[14008.10s -> 14023.27s]  I just don't feel like doing that. Like I'm just gonna be honest. Why am I sliding? What the fuck?
[14029.54s -> 14035.99s]  What's wrong with the car? Close functions. What? All right. Enough of the bullshit. Let's go
[14038.36s -> 14044.76s]  clear the debt. I want to just, I want to see what the service hub is. I want to go there.
[14048.52s -> 14054.36s]  200 million per TikTok. But the TikTok has to get over 2k likes. Oh, fuck that.
[14058.18s -> 14068.68s]  Come on. I would have to hop on every trend on TikTok. Although that's kind of funny though.
[14089.46s -> 14102.82s]  Okay. All right. We're fine. 2k likes isn't much. That's kind of a lot, isn't it? Did I ever tell
[14102.82s -> 14106.82s]  you guys the idea of how I wanted to make a children's YouTube channel and not tell anyone?
[14108.55s -> 14112.31s]  Never speak a word of it and try to get like a billion fucking views on it.
[14113.51s -> 14121.35s]  God, I wish I was able to do that. I wish I was. Just make like a real good like children's
[14121.35s -> 14125.99s]  YouTube channel. That was like really, really well made. And don't tell any of you guys
[14127.38s -> 14137.99s]  until somebody had to find it. It's still time. Maybe one day. I wouldn't be Jerma. I would be
[14137.99s -> 14142.79s]  like Mr. Happy. It doesn't, I don't know. I'd be, I wouldn't be me. So you wouldn't be able to type
[14142.79s -> 14150.30s]  in like Jerma children's channel. No, that wouldn't work. And try to be more popular than this channel
[14150.30s -> 14163.83s]  here. I feel like I could, I think I could do it. God, what? Like, I really, I got to dial back
[14163.83s -> 14168.47s]  that narcissism here. Yeah. I think I could have a billion view children's channel. I'd be the
[14168.47s -> 14181.21s]  biggest TikToker in the world. Oh, Jeremy, right. Is this anything you can't do? I can't move. I
[14181.21s -> 14198.30s]  think I'm stuck on a log. Yeah, I'm stuck on a log. I actually, there's a shitload of stuff that I
[14198.30s -> 14214.86s]  can't do. A lot. Like a lot, a lot. Come on. That was a bunch of bullshit. There we go. I want to
[14214.86s -> 14227.16s]  see what's down here. I might be in trouble here. Maybe it's time to wind down and stop the stream.
[14230.63s -> 14242.60s]  No, I want to at least do one. I wanted to get to here. I can get out of here.
[14242.60s -> 14252.09s]  Four hour Andy. Yeah, that's me. Go back to Michigan. You know what? That's a great idea.
[14252.09s -> 14272.92s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to do that. Okay. Leave garage. Can I just, can I fast travel?
[14277.24s -> 14281.00s]  How do I fast travel? There was a menu I could go to before. Was it in the garage?
[14281.64s -> 14304.06s]  Where is it? What did I get to that menu before? Do I have to just drive there? No,
[14304.06s -> 14318.26s]  you can't drive from Alaska to Michigan. Can you? Yeah, you can. You gotta drive through Canada,
[14318.26s -> 14338.39s]  though. I gotta go to the garage. The actual garage. Mr. Slime. Yeah, there's been a couple
[14338.39s -> 14343.91s]  of concepts over the years of I just put a shitload of time into something and never tell you about
[14343.91s -> 14348.95s]  it and hope that I eventually you figure it out after like a year. And every time I come up with
[14348.95s -> 14353.05s]  one of these things, I think it's funny. I always have to go back to the fact that I have to do that
[14353.05s -> 14360.68s]  thing. Like I would, I would have to stream as Mr. Slime TV, like six hours a day. It's actually
[14360.68s -> 14367.62s]  streamed for like a year. That's like, that's like, I would, I don't even stream that much on my own
[14367.62s -> 14385.85s]  channel. Okay. So now we got to go to map. I can go here. Oh shit. I can go anywhere I want now.
[14385.85s -> 14399.27s]  Yukon. Let's go back to Michigan. Michigan. Think of the profits. I don't know if there would be
[14399.27s -> 14409.56s]  very many profits. Yeah, let's go. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[14409.56s -> 14428.57s]  We don't. Oh, I have to move to garage, right? Okay. You never finished the TikTok discussion?
[14429.29s -> 14454.47s]  I don't think there's much else to discuss. Dual Twitch personality. Yeah. I think it'd be funny
[14454.47s -> 14460.41s]  for a little while, but then here's the problem with that. Both of these ideas. Who gets to take
[14460.41s -> 14469.08s]  priority? Let's say that Mr. Slime TV, right, or whatever his name is, gets to a point where he's
[14469.08s -> 14477.43s]  pulling 10k viewers a stream what do i do who do i even who am i who should i stream with if the
[14477.43s -> 14483.46s]  children's youtube channel has a billion views like that's i would have to i have to prioritize
[14483.46s -> 14499.88s]  it let's get this here did i already get this one no i don't i don't think so just sell out
[14499.88s -> 14505.48s]  completely just have one of my streamer personalities be the ultimate sellout and they just sell a
[14505.48s -> 14516.74s]  shitload of merch and it's sponsor space and like bounties and shit that's so fucked up but it's
[14516.74s -> 14535.06s]  funny wouldn't be the first time you abandoned the channel i want that guy timed out for a day
[14535.62s -> 14553.45s]  no don't actually do that this is dangerous but it's kind of the way i have to go what the fuck
[14553.45s -> 14565.08s]  what what the fuck what the fuck why is everything what the fuck it was literally the worst noise
[14569.53s -> 14572.68s]  was it you fucked up bro
[14579.56s -> 14586.47s]  that's my favorite yeah yeah hey you fucked up bro you fucked up dude go listen to it
[14586.47s -> 14616.50s]  somebody let me play it let me see it any any clips nine human goose baby wouldn't be the first
[14616.50s -> 14643.56s]  time you abandoned the channel not that bad it sounds that sounded like a seagull sounded like
[14643.56s -> 14649.29s]  a seagull with like a big dog bone in his throat or something like in a cartoon you know when they
[14649.29s -> 14652.89s]  swallow the big piece of meat and like and the bone like gets stuck and sticking out of both
[14652.89s -> 14673.72s]  sides of their skin like a car horn you know like tom like takes a big bite of the meat and he's
[14673.72s -> 14681.80s]  like and he's like got the bone is like sticking out of both sides of his like neck why am i
[14681.80s -> 14700.65s]  driving i'm not pressing any buttons squidward with the thing with a fork in his throat yeah
[14701.29s -> 14711.78s]  that's what it is yeah stop it all right i'm stopping oh what's over here i won't okay i
[14711.78s -> 14728.12s]  won't do that noise ever again i promise that happened to squidward bro but yeah i i won't do
[14728.12s -> 14735.34s]  that noise again i promise i promise i won't make that noise ever again unless i eat a gigantic ham
[14735.90s -> 14761.80s]  on a big bone and it gets stuck in there this is very okay you want to hear my final assessment
[14761.80s -> 14778.18s]  of this game um okay you ready so snow runner sort of reminds me of when you just take a car
[14779.13s -> 14783.69s]  in gta 5 and just say fuck it i don't even care i'm just driving in a random direction
[14784.25s -> 14803.06s]  out into the wilderness and they made an entire game based off of it it's pretty cool i was so
[14803.06s -> 14807.72s]  scared you'd make the sound again i'm not gonna look if you get booed and do stuff throwing
[14807.72s -> 14815.16s]  tomatoes at you you don't keep doing the thing that they booed you for i took my booze i said
[14815.16s -> 14824.52s]  all right and i moved on unless i look unless i think it's funny which maybe i do you might
[14824.52s -> 14830.63s]  hear it again sometime i've made that sound like a half dozen times before it always gets
[14830.63s -> 14836.23s]  nominated that sound always is there at the end of the stream worst of the year awards always
[14836.23s -> 14842.39s]  it's every time go look back at worst sound category i guarantee you that sound is there
[14842.39s -> 14861.18s]  each time we've done it the last two or three years it's definitely there this is really pretty
[14861.18s -> 14882.47s]  stop making that noise stop stop stop making that sound it's not me doing it the frogs are
[14882.47s -> 14894.86s]  going like i'm not gonna do it but you heard it can't wait for part two of the german awards
[14895.66s -> 14920.60s]  oh yeah that's right warehouse is this what it's really like to drive in one of these
[14920.60s -> 14931.13s]  this looks like hell this sucks yeah it is do you eat beforehand i hope you don't
[14931.13s -> 14951.11s]  this is just turbulence plane simulator you eat during it oh my goodness this seems so rough
[14951.59s -> 14970.42s]  wait where are we going oh all right cool i'll go this way i didn't even press that that was my
[14970.42s -> 14988.60s]  elbow all i'm going through thick thick mud this is cool this is a cool game i don't know if i'm
[14988.60s -> 14994.76s]  gonna play this again i probably won't you know i'm one-off andy but this i like this it actually
[14994.76s -> 15021.96s]  was pretty cool how much is this game how much is 30 bucks 30 dollars yeah i think that's worth it
[15021.96s -> 15028.87s]  if you're a truck enthusiast but you love off-roading he's just like kind of exploring
[15028.87s -> 15032.47s]  and doing the difficult missions of trying to load cargo and go through mud and stuff
[15033.03s -> 15077.11s]  i mean it's 30 dollars i think is pretty reasonable so anticlimactic it's not even funny
[15077.11s -> 15085.56s]  i was going for a big finish and i'm just stuck that was there yeah that's resident sleeper come
[15085.56s -> 15096.20s]  on now i just have to call triple a you know what i mean i was going for a big leg oh there they go
[15098.15s -> 15117.03s]  land and keep driving no fuck oh well i can't impress the horn should have gone faster than 10
[15117.03s -> 15134.10s]  miles per hour all right let's repair all all right now what can i turn the engine on what does
[15134.10s -> 15141.99s]  this guy look like there all right there you go you got what you wanted everybody that was here
[15141.99s -> 15148.63s]  you got the imposter is fucking stupid ass sus face that you got it i did i just realized that's
[15148.63s -> 15153.74s]  what i just did there it is you've been asking for that for like two hours and i did i just did it
[15155.99s -> 15174.78s]  so there you go oh whatever did you see that and it was the same exact scenario too
[15175.34s -> 15184.33s]  have i learned nothing in the like four years since that picture was taken it was the same
[15184.33s -> 15190.73s]  the webcam was off somebody said i bet you what does this guy look like do a scary face and i
[15190.73s -> 15196.15s]  turned it on doing a weird face and it turned it off immediately we're just in a never-ending
[15196.15s -> 15220.71s]  circle it's just never gonna end anyways dude sus 2.0 dropped well not really and i'm just as
[15220.71s -> 15232.31s]  sweaty too all right uh i'm gonna call it here i wanted to stream at least once here until the
[15232.31s -> 15236.47s]  weekend because yesterday was like a two-hour andy with the behind the scenes show so i was
[15236.47s -> 15242.26s]  like let's just do something tomorrow too so here we are i actually had a lot of fun in this game
[15242.26s -> 15247.88s]  if i had a little bit more brain power and more patience i'd probably keep playing it
[15247.88s -> 15255.16s]  but i will see you guys again we're gonna start no more heroes three uh probably on friday or
[15255.16s -> 15260.63s]  saturday so in a couple days two three days we'll go two days in a row because i i'm really actually
[15260.63s -> 15268.65s]  very excited for that game very much excited to play it still kind of coming down from the dollhouse
[15268.65s -> 15277.02s]  uh still that high is still there and i'm just sort of trying to pace myself a little bit but
[15277.02s -> 15284.87s]  thanks for watching we'll see you again some other time hopefully in a couple days what about hard
[15284.87s -> 15289.27s]  time hard time is going to be i'm going to play it on the ipad probably or maybe the pc version
[15289.27s -> 15293.53s]  because it was kind of confusing there's like three versions but i was going to do like an
[15293.53s -> 15298.87s]  m dicky night there's two or three games that are only on mobile devices and one of them looks
[15298.87s -> 15305.43s]  really funny it's a superhero game you make your own superhero and you live in an m dicky universe
[15305.43s -> 15311.56s]  so i mean i kind of want to play that one so maybe we'll probably just do them all one night
[15311.56s -> 15326.38s]  just kind of cycle through them uh yeah let me remember how to stream here here it is thanks

[15332.55s -> 15339.70s]  really had a chance to take a even look at my twitch dashboard uh but the amount of subscribers
[15339.70s -> 15348.74s]  here now are way more than i've ever had so i don't even know what to say about this kind of
[15348.74s -> 15358.38s]  uh subscription account it's crazy and obviously i mean i know this is probably even if it's
[15358.38s -> 15365.34s]  temporary i don't i don't know how there's many people that have given this channel five dollars
