[3.45s -> 13.29s]  Hey, what's happening guys? It's Jerma again. I got a one life gameplay for you.
[13.29s -> 20.31s]  This is the series I'm continuing from before where I show you one life from one class and with a particular loadout that I choose.
[20.37s -> 25.85s]  This is a soldier gameplay with one life. I kill 22 people in one life.
[25.85s -> 32.41s]  It's an absolute massacre of a gameplay and you'll see right off the back at Kritzkrieg and I just destroyed two or three people.
[32.41s -> 35.61s]  I know that you can't kill sentries with the Kritzkrieg.
[35.61s -> 38.97s]  I know there's no bonus to the Kritzkrieg if you are killing a sentry.
[38.97s -> 43.89s]  I know that so don't worry. This pyro goes down and I'll tell you the loadout for the match.
[43.89s -> 49.33s]  The loadout is the Liberty Launcher, the whip, and the buff banner. As you can see here
[49.33s -> 53.42s]  I have the buff banner ready to go, but we are just really really crushing them right now.
[53.42s -> 56.38s]  So I don't really see a need for it, but right here there's a lot of people coming up.
[56.38s -> 60.58s]  So I switch it out, blow the horn, and here we go. Time for some complete domination.
[61.10s -> 64.14s]  I love the sound it makes when other people get Kritz. It's awesome.
[64.22s -> 69.26s]  So all these people, my screen starts lagging because I just couldn't handle it. Kill one person here, get this demo man.
[69.58s -> 74.90s]  Sorry, I think I get the pyro. I get the pyro. Sorry. Now we're spawn camping now and this is bad news.
[74.90s -> 78.62s]  Get that engineer with a nice shot. This is bad news. In the middle here
[78.62s -> 81.02s]  I kind of tell people I say, you know what, let them come out of the spawn,
[81.02s -> 86.50s]  but we have our fun for a good five or six minutes. So Smart Soldier comes out with the battalion's backup.
[86.50s -> 89.66s]  He blows it. They make a great push, but it's just not enough.
[89.66s -> 94.50s]  I actually have like two pocket medics in this particular gameplay. Not right now,
[94.50s -> 96.70s]  but this guy right here, he's a good, this guy, Swift,
[96.70s -> 102.23s]  he's my pocket medic for a while here. Kill a couple more people and then he pops the uber and
[102.51s -> 104.67s]  there's nothing I can really do here. I kill this heavy.
[104.67s -> 110.47s]  There's no one really around. Get the heavy with one shot. He tries to run away and I get him. This pyro,
[110.47s -> 112.95s]  I believe he gets killed by the heavy right next to me, and then I get Kritzkrieg'd.
[112.95s -> 117.53s]  I was like, oh no, because I blew the horn and I would have definitely waited,
[117.53s -> 122.09s]  but I killed two or three people with this too, this Kritzkrieg. So I get ubered and Kritzkrieg'd.
[122.09s -> 128.25s]  So everybody else on the server, I'm sorry that you didn't get to use these two medics to your advantage.
[128.25s -> 133.99s]  Heavy medic appear on the way out. I'm not gonna get myself killed. Me and Larry, the combat spy,
[133.99s -> 136.79s]  just hanging out back here behind this rock, taking a little detour,
[137.27s -> 141.51s]  charging the buff banner on all those people that come out, and then there's a spy that turns around the corner.
[141.51s -> 146.31s]  There he is. Definitely a dead ringer, but it's not a problem at all because he charged my buff banner.
[146.67s -> 151.19s]  Blow the horn and guys, watch this, like eight people die because of me and a pyro.
[151.47s -> 156.15s]  Check this out. Look at him. There he is on the left. Just like absolutely smoking people because of the Kritz.
[156.87s -> 163.22s]  Unbelievable. We kill like eight people collectively together, and I guess I also had the uber from the quick fix on me,
[163.22s -> 165.78s]  which I was not aware of until watching this gameplay.
[165.78s -> 169.82s]  I guess I was just so in the moment right there that I just wasn't even paying attention to that,
[169.82s -> 173.10s]  but that was definitely a reason why we pushed so well right there.
[173.30s -> 177.46s]  Uber heavy on the cart, but it doesn't matter. My team is very, very good right now.
[177.46s -> 179.46s]  We're very confident in what we have for our position.
[179.62s -> 183.42s]  So we make our way back up here, and they're in their spawn again.
[183.50s -> 187.74s]  They haven't been able to come past this rocky area right here for the entire match.
[187.98s -> 191.66s]  So it's really not a good thing to spawn camp and to keep people here,
[191.66s -> 197.89s]  which is why you'll see eventually I make people go back. I say, guys, guys, guys, don't do this anymore. This is stupid.
[197.89s -> 201.77s]  I'd rather have a challenge. I'd rather have them be able to get out because when you're getting spawn camped,
[201.77s -> 205.73s]  it's very, very difficult to even get out of the spawn, and it's just not fair.
[206.17s -> 210.85s]  Let's get a crit screak here now. Bang, get this one guy, and then I get Ubered again from the quick fix.
[210.85s -> 215.89s]  You'll see I was just pocketed the whole time by like two or three different people, like I said before.
[216.21s -> 221.61s]  So I apologize again, blow the horn for the banner, and we're at their spawn again.
[221.61s -> 227.16s]  That's all there is to it. We're just at their spawn again, and they can't even get out, and this is just bad news.
[227.16s -> 231.80s]  Look at this. Just shooting randomly into the spawn getting kills. Lucky crit on that heavy,
[231.88s -> 238.34s]  and then he just dies by, I think he got headshot actually. This is the point right now where I'm saying over the mic,
[238.86s -> 244.78s]  everybody back up, everyone get to the point. Let's forget this. Don't spawn camp, and everyone listens to me.
[244.78s -> 248.90s]  We all come back here. See how we're all just running this way. We're all in this little cubby area.
[248.90s -> 251.22s]  You'll see it's kind of funny. Look at like everybody just sitting there.
[251.26s -> 255.70s]  We wanted to give them at least 10 to 15 seconds to get out of the spawn. There they are.
[255.70s -> 261.14s]  They're all out now, and it really just didn't matter at all. I get Ubered again,
[261.14s -> 267.46s]  and we come back, and look at where we end up after this push that they have. We end up right back in their spawn.
[268.25s -> 273.25s]  Lucky crit on that heavy goes down, and this soldier watch is funny. He just turns around. He's like, you know what? Screw this.
[273.37s -> 278.65s]  I'm just gonna run the other way with the equalizer. Probably a good idea, and now look at where we are.
[278.77s -> 283.17s]  We're all back at their spawn again, and at this point, there's only a minute and a half left.
[283.17s -> 285.89s]  I just said, you know what? Screw it. Whatever. I tried.
[285.89s -> 289.13s]  I tried to let people come out of the spawn, but it just didn't matter.
[289.45s -> 296.69s]  Only reason why I came back here was to make sure there was no scouts or no spies that would potentially be able to cap the point, or even get on the cart.
[296.69s -> 302.11s]  I just wanted to make sure that we could just end this without a problem. Blow the banner, and here comes the cavalry. That's a spy.
[302.11s -> 308.67s]  I know it. He tries to face Stabby, but I do a self-destruct kill on him. Once again, when we get down here,
[308.67s -> 314.61s]  I get critscrieged again, and I don't know. You'll see. Where the hell did this guy's teleporter go? Look at this.
[314.83s -> 318.53s]  Where did that thing go? Get a few kills. I actually kill him. See,
[318.53s -> 320.33s]  I kill him right before he gets on the teleporter.
[320.33s -> 325.26s]  Where did that thing go? If you were in this server, and you were on Blue Team when this happened,
[325.26s -> 331.20s]  tell me where that teleporter went, because I'm really curious to know. At this point in the match now,
[331.64s -> 334.72s]  somebody was screaming over the mic. They're saying, oh my god, get to the cart.
[334.72s -> 338.52s]  There's like a bunch of people here, so I was like, oh jeez. So I blow the banner.
[338.52s -> 344.36s]  Of course, I had one again, and there's a heavy medic on the cart. It doesn't matter. They go down, and look at this.
[344.36s -> 349.16s]  I am screwed here. I'm like, no, no, I'm having such a good round. Please don't kill me.
[349.20s -> 351.20s]  I whip you to death, and that's the end.
[351.96s -> 358.24s]  22 kills in one life, and that's the one life as the soldier in this gameplay.
[358.56s -> 361.80s]  Thank you all for watching so much, guys. I'd really appreciate it.
[361.80s -> 366.78s]  I'll leave the rest of the gameplay up so you guys can see that I scoot Dugan's like a goose.
[367.30s -> 372.48s]  Scoot Dugan's like a goose, and I'll see you guys later. Take care, everybody.
