[4.02s -> 22.04s]  How's it going? How are you? Yeah, good. Hope you're doing good. Welcome, everybody. I'm late.
[22.04s -> 29.05s]  Oh, I'm actually early by about an hour. You're almost at 1 million. I know. I'm keeping an eye
[29.05s -> 43.86s]  on it. I'm keeping a very close eye on that follower count. We're gonna do some chill stuff today.
[44.42s -> 50.97s]  I have some fun stuff to talk about, though. Well, I have two. I have a shitty thing to talk about,
[50.97s -> 55.29s]  and then I have a cool thing to talk about. What do you want to hear first? Good news or bad news?
[60.15s -> 73.21s]  Good news or bad news? Bad news always first. Okay. I might have COVID. I took a PCR yesterday,
[77.69s -> 84.74s]  so trying to figure out what to do. Lockdown, hunker down. Holly is positive, so
[85.94s -> 92.23s]  I'm still testing negative, but I want to go get a PCR. So we're gonna find out in another day or
[92.23s -> 96.23s]  two, because I keep testing negative on the at-home test, but I heard that that is possible. So,
[97.78s -> 101.14s]  but let me just be very clear. Seems to be very mild so far.
[101.86s -> 106.81s]  She's fine. Very mild, as well as me. I mean, I'm obviously listening to me, right? You can hear it.
[108.89s -> 122.55s]  I think, I think we're okay. I think we're gonna be good. So that's the bad news. The good news is,
[124.44s -> 129.40s]  no, baseball's not delayed. What do you mean? Baseball's in a month. I'm not delay. I said,
[129.40s -> 133.88s]  guys, sorry. I might have, I might have COVID. So baseball in a month is canceled.
[134.52s -> 141.51s]  It's not gonna happen. But no, this is good news. You want to hear the good news? This is actually
[141.51s -> 151.35s]  really cool. I'm gonna be playing Multi Versus in a couple days here. Remember that game? Remember
[151.35s -> 159.27s]  that game? Remember Multi Versus? And guess what? It's gonna be sponsored. So, fucking hell yeah.
[162.41s -> 169.45s]  That's pretty cool. I've been waiting for that game to come back. And they reached out and it's
[169.45s -> 178.81s]  like, all right, fucking yeah, let's go. You're gonna lose your sponsorship for swearing. I'm
[178.81s -> 188.15s]  not sponsored right now. I'm not gonna swear that much. I'll be, I'll be good. Marketing Andy.
[190.70s -> 196.86s]  Which game? Multi Versus. You remember the Bugs Bunny game? That's coming back. And I've been
[196.86s -> 211.58s]  waiting. I want to play that game so badly. I'm so excited for that game. Yeah, I'm not 998.
[212.14s -> 220.10s]  That's insane. If I have COVID, fuck. No, I'll be fine. I'll be fine. I'm gonna be good.
[220.82s -> 232.47s]  Trust me, I'll be fine. He's gonna have, you have to be brand friendly, Andy. Honestly, okay, I feel
[232.47s -> 237.51s]  like, let me be very honest with you. I feel like I am kind, I'm pretty brand friendly as it is.
[237.51s -> 245.69s]  Don't you think? I don't think I'm a brand risk. I think it's just, I am just who I am. And that's
[245.69s -> 250.97s]  it. And I don't, I don't think I'd do anything that would be a risk or anything. I mean, I say
[250.97s -> 257.42s]  swear words. You guys, we, we are the, yeah, you guys are the brand risk, not me.
[259.16s -> 265.16s]  This chat is the brand risk. I, I can behave during a sponsor segment. You guys are the brand risk.
[267.54s -> 275.24s]  That's fucking funny. You literally, yeah, I, you're literally weird. You're naked. I'm, I didn't,
[275.24s -> 282.74s]  no, just listen to me. I can be brand friendly. I can turn, I can be very brand friendly. I think
[282.74s -> 298.86s]  you guys can too. I think we can work together. Uh, the other stream while advertising another
[298.86s -> 303.34s]  stream, you spent like 15 minutes advertising a different mobile game. What? The other stream
[303.34s -> 308.54s]  while advertising another stream, you spent 15 minutes advertising a different game. No, I didn't.
[309.58s -> 316.38s]  I was making a comment on, um, on mobile game ads. I never mentioned a game. By the way,
[316.38s -> 321.98s]  that sponsor segment was well over by then. I streamed that game for six hours two days ago.
[323.16s -> 328.36s]  The sponsor segment was not for six hours. I took the ad out of the, out of the title. We
[328.36s -> 337.22s]  were just playing. I can be, I can be brand friendly. Whatever. Do you know what brand
[337.22s -> 346.79s]  friendly? I get this for you. Um, what do I got? That's not your whole, all your conversations were
[346.79s -> 359.18s]  not brand friendly before on that whole stream. 864 P Andy. Somebody tell him. How'd your physical
[359.18s -> 369.43s]  with the bug eating doctor go? It was pretty good. But yeah, I'm going to, I have a mute button
[369.43s -> 373.03s]  here. I don't know if I'm going to be on cam that much this stream, but whatever we'll see.
[373.75s -> 376.95s]  This is probably not going to be a long stream either. Cause I was like, I'm ready to go now
[377.67s -> 381.83s]  and I want to stream. It's not that I don't want to stream. So I want to be live. I want to hang
[381.83s -> 389.35s]  out. I'm going to play my time. Is it, is it, is it Portia Portia or Portia? What is it? How do I
[389.35s -> 402.68s]  pronounce it? Spell it phonetically in the chat. It's Portia Portia. Okay. All right. So yeah,
[402.68s -> 410.58s]  you're going to hear me mute sometimes like this. That's for me to kind of clear my throat. Cause I
[410.58s -> 416.31s]  don't want to be gross on stream. I will obviously keep everybody updated on how I'm doing over the
[416.31s -> 423.56s]  next few days, but as it is right now, I'm still, I'm still testing negative for it, but we'll see.
[423.56s -> 429.24s]  I did a PCR and that you, there is no, I don't know what the, what the false negative rate on that is,
[429.24s -> 440.70s]  but who knows? Let's find out. All right. So let's go. Let's play. I've been hearing this music the
[440.70s -> 450.71s]  whole time. I'm sitting here telling you guys that I'm like, I've been exposed to COVID and this is
[450.71s -> 461.90s]  all I hear. This is like not the right music. Is the baseball stream in trouble? No, the baseball
[461.90s -> 467.77s]  stream is, is perfectly fine. That got moved to August 19th. So don't worry. That's still gone.
[473.61s -> 484.26s]  Okay. Here we go. I have it ready, right? Yeah, I do. So this game, if you want to,
[484.34s -> 488.34s]  okay. I wanted just to chill today. I didn't want to have like a crazy stream with a bunch of crazy
[488.34s -> 497.18s]  shit going on. So this is going to be a chill day. You understand? If I have, if I have boogers
[497.18s -> 499.82s]  coming out of my nose, you need to be, you need to tell me. Otherwise there's no way I'm going to
[499.82s -> 506.47s]  know. Should I, is it a controller game? Is it a controller game or what? Or should I do keyboard
[506.47s -> 516.90s]  and mouse? Controller game? This is Harvest Moon. I mean, it's supposed to be kind of, it's like a
[516.90s -> 522.55s]  Stardew Valley kind of game. Once, oh, oh, thank you for reminding me. I'm going to sneeze. No,
[522.55s -> 527.53s]  I'm not. Okay. No, I'm fine. Let me tell you something about green screen. So green screen
[527.53s -> 532.94s]  movie night, I'm going to address you directly on this. Green screen movie night. It, I don't have
[532.94s -> 542.41s]  a date for it yet, but this is the final day to submit something. If you have a video that you
[542.41s -> 548.71s]  want to submit, please go to the discord and read the rules. This is tonight at midnight Pacific.
[549.43s -> 556.92s]  It's over. We're closing submissions tonight. We have already hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[556.92s -> 561.22s]  of submissions. It's going to be a lot to go through them. I'm not going through them because
[561.22s -> 566.50s]  I obviously want to stay completely. I don't, I want to be in the dark completely on it. I have
[566.50s -> 573.72s]  watched because I couldn't help it. I've watched like four of them and I was laughing my ass off.
[573.72s -> 580.57s]  So, and I was like, I got to stop. Don't look at it anymore. No more. So tonight it's over.
[580.57s -> 593.82s]  You're desynced. I am not desynced. You look pretty pale today. Yeah. Well, the exclamation point,
[593.82s -> 606.28s]  sick. What the hell is in your ear? What? What do you mean? Oh, this. Okay. It's an earbud.
[606.28s -> 619.05s]  You look pretty pink. Do I? Whatever. There's a bug in your ear. Your neck looks really bulgy today.
[620.01s -> 624.97s]  No, it's because I have a fucking gross beard. All right. So that if you have a submission,
[624.97s -> 633.94s]  just get it in. This is your last day to do it. After tonight, we're going to vet all these,
[633.94s -> 640.73s]  probably shave it down a little bit. And then I want to say over the next six or seven days,
[640.73s -> 645.80s]  maybe less depending on how, how fast it takes to go through them. So you can imagine somewhere in
[645.80s -> 657.48s]  that week of, let's see here. So submissions are done tonight. So therefore you can expect
[657.48s -> 666.14s]  somewhere around maybe this coming weekend, possibly we'll do it. Maybe if, if we can get
[666.14s -> 672.12s]  through them, maybe Sunday, this next kind of Sunday, this weekend, I don't have a hard
[672.12s -> 677.24s]  date for you though. I will have a good date for you in two days. So when I stream on Tuesday,
[677.24s -> 681.27s]  I'll give you guys a hard date because then we, I can go over with the mods and the community
[681.27s -> 685.64s]  leaders and stuff. We can figure out how long it's going to take. I didn't, did I pass a million?
[685.64s -> 692.89s]  You liar. I didn't pass a million. Tweet that the submissions end tonight.
[692.89s -> 708.01s]  Yeah, that's a good idea. It's still pretty early. Let me tweet this. Hold on. 99875.
[708.01s -> 725.90s]  It might happen today. It might not. It depends. I should write. Also green screen movie night
[725.90s -> 748.78s]  submissions end tonight at 1201 midnight. Technically that's tomorrow, right? But like
[748.78s -> 765.74s]  people get it. If you have something, go read the rules in the discord and maybe. Okay. Oh,
[765.74s -> 777.35s]  that's it. That's good enough. If you have something, go read the rules in the discord
[777.99s -> 787.99s]  and submit it. Is that good? Also green screen movie night submissions end tonight. Wait, green
[787.99s -> 794.86s]  screen movie night submissions end tonight. That's fine. At 1201 midnight. I say night three times.
[794.86s -> 802.25s]  Green screen movie night submissions end tonight at 1201 midnight. 12. Should I say end at 1201
[802.25s -> 811.30s]  midnight? That's better. End at 1201 midnight tonight. How do I say this without saying fucking
[812.26s -> 827.24s]  night three times? And then a thumbs up. That's good. Who cares? I do. This is green screen movie
[827.24s -> 846.17s]  night, man. All right. That's good. Tweeting. That's good. That's 1201 midnight tonight. That
[846.17s -> 855.32s]  makes sense, right? That people get it. Oh, I didn't say Pacific. Oh, who cares? Why can't you
[855.32s -> 862.97s]  edit a tweet? Whatever, whatever time zone you're in, it doesn't matter. Like it's just,
[863.53s -> 867.61s]  just like tonight. Look, if you submit it at like one o'clock in the morning,
[868.25s -> 876.02s]  I don't care. Who cares? We'll let it in. Don't worry. It's going to be fine.
[876.02s -> 884.74s]  You ready to play my time at Porsche? But yeah, I'm excited about that. That should be a lot of fun.
[884.74s -> 896.02s]  Okay. You guys ready? New game. Is my face game in a bad spot? Also, nobody is. I asked if this is
[896.02s -> 906.58s]  a controller game and everybody ignored me. I'll use mouse for now. I think I'll go talk with the
[906.58s -> 912.41s]  research center first. Go talk with the research center first. I think I'll go talk with the
[912.41s -> 922.07s]  research center first. Which one sounds like me? Oh, okay. I'll say it and then you guys tell me.
[922.07s -> 927.67s]  I think I'll go talk with the research center first. Research center first. I think I'll go
[927.67s -> 931.75s]  talk with the research center first. I think I'll go talk with the research center first.
[931.75s -> 937.69s]  Not one. I think I'll go talk with the research center first. This house is so weird. I think I'll
[937.69s -> 943.21s]  go search center first. That's close. I think I'll go talk with the research center first.
[943.21s -> 947.85s]  Get out of here. I don't know. No, that's not me. All right, so we're gonna go three.
[947.85s -> 953.46s]  I think I'll go talk with the research center first. Okay, hair. How did I spin him? Oh, okay.
[954.26s -> 974.71s]  All right, hair length. Hair. Oh, hair highlight? No, no. Probably this one. Wait. No, this one,
[974.71s -> 986.78s]  but short. That's pretty good, right? Or is it this one, but shorter? This one or the other one?
[990.70s -> 998.31s]  Bowl cut. Bowl cut or riot. This one's fine. Yeah, that's that. That's what it is. All right,
[998.31s -> 1008.50s]  so what is it? It's like kind of like more like this. That's pretty close, right? That's close
[1008.50s -> 1020.39s]  enough. Like that. Yeah, that's close enough. Make it wicked greasy looking. Marco. My name is,
[1020.39s -> 1035.43s]  I don't want it to be me though. All right, I want it to be Craig. No, not Craig. Joshua.
[1037.40s -> 1085.54s]  Jerry. Jerry's easy. Okay, now face type. Upper face? Wait, oh, I can do this? This doesn't look
[1085.54s -> 1113.69s]  like me at all. It's like not even fucking close. That's pretty close. Lower face? This looks like
[1113.69s -> 1162.87s]  Mark Zuckerberg. Okay. Do I really care that much about this, honestly? Jesus. I'm just that guy
[1162.87s -> 1182.31s]  from Homescapes. You know the mobile game? Okay, uh, I think I'm gonna stick with this. Yeah,
[1182.31s -> 1194.25s]  we're staying with this. Okay, is that good? Do the longer mustache? No, no, no, no. No,
[1194.25s -> 1205.70s]  this one's better. Okay, that sounds good to me. It's Jeff Foxworthy. Who cares? Let's just go.
[1205.70s -> 1218.92s]  Choose your birthday. I get to pick my birthday? Okay, what month is this? Day one, month two.
[1219.72s -> 1228.66s]  Where's the month? Where's the month? Wait, there are only four months in a year? Wait,
[1228.66s -> 1249.30s]  what? There's only four months. They don't even have my birthday. Okay, um, how about fall third?
[1250.36s -> 1261.56s]  Fall third? I was gonna say fall third. Do 420. Oh my god, I hate you for saying that. Don't do that.
[1261.56s -> 1281.40s]  I'm not doing it. I'm doing fall third. I'm not doing 420. That's the easiest dumb thing.
[1287.00s -> 1297.10s]  Okay, here we go. We're about to land at Porsche.
[1297.50s -> 1316.34s]  Wait, that looks beautiful. What are you gonna do then? Yeah. We get someone like you wants to be young.
[1323.10s -> 1332.28s]  Thanks. All right, so now what? I'm gonna do, I'm gonna play controller. Did I keep asking this
[1332.28s -> 1340.79s]  question? Should I use the controller? I've asked it three times but I just don't look after five
[1340.79s -> 1345.64s]  seconds because it takes about 10 seconds for the delay to go through and I just forget. Is this so
[1345.64s -> 1354.20s]  hard to use a controller? Controller? All right, yeah. All right, here we go. Presley, how do you do?
[1357.38s -> 1368.63s]  Hope you had a pleasant journey. We're just chilling today. Yeah, anyway, I'm here to show
[1368.63s -> 1375.35s]  you to your workshop. All right. I didn't get to know my part too well. Turn up the volume.
[1375.35s -> 1386.23s]  Is it low for you? Is that better? No one's been working there since your pa left Porsche so many
[1386.23s -> 1392.39s]  years ago. Is this Pokemon? No, it's not Pokemon. This is my time at Porsche. Yeah. This game is
[1392.39s -> 1397.99s]  apparently very good so hold, excuse me, hold your judgments now. Hold your judgments right now.
[1402.26s -> 1417.88s]  All right. Dash is R1 plus R1. Okay. Jump is circle. Get the battle axe. This place sure has
[1417.88s -> 1428.20s]  seen some wear and tear. What do you think? Looks homely. Now then. That's too loud. Well, blame that
[1428.20s -> 1431.24s]  guy. That's it to turn it up. He hasn't been presented to you when you've seen this house.
[1432.20s -> 1441.14s]  Okay, so I got a letter. Jerry, when you read this letter, I will already be on the other side of the
[1441.14s -> 1447.14s]  world. I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry that I'm not the father you wanted me to be. This was all so
[1447.14s -> 1452.10s]  sudden. So I didn't have much time to tell you or figure out how to take care of you. Then I thought
[1452.10s -> 1456.90s]  about this workshop. It might not look like much now, but I will brace you for the wind and cover
[1456.90s -> 1463.22s]  you from the rain. I've left my workshop handbook that details how I created things in my workshop.
[1463.69s -> 1469.45s]  The rest is up to you. Do your best and live a wonderful life. You always will. Here's the
[1469.45s -> 1478.17s]  workshop handbook. That's the worst George I've ever heard. It's Gilbert Godford. Can't miss it.
[1487.78s -> 1497.10s]  That was fucking Gilbert Godford. You're right. Okay. Here's the workshop handbook of your paws.
[1497.10s -> 1501.82s]  Take your time and come to Portia Commerce Guild tomorrow. It's right around the Peach Plaza. You
[1501.82s -> 1505.10s]  can't miss it. As much as I'd like to give you a builder license right away,
[1505.10s -> 1517.30s]  you need to prove your worth. Oh god. Got it. Tomorrow. Anyway. I gotta do my turn off button.
[1517.30s -> 1523.59s]  Get some rest. Maybe. Yeah. Nope. Bye, Presley. Thanks for your help. Oh, you made me laugh too
[1523.59s -> 1536.81s]  hard. Day two. Wait, a whole day went by? This house is so worn. This place is huge. You need
[1536.81s -> 1546.50s]  to fix it or I won't be getting a good night's sleep. Okay. How do I fix it? Use three
[1546.50s -> 1553.06s]  wood? I don't have three wood. All right. I gotta go to the com- Do I have a map? Go to the com- I
[1553.06s -> 1564.09s]  can't fix this place up. Comically large bed. The glowing objects are most likely to be collectible
[1564.09s -> 1576.10s]  resources. Okay. Glowing objects are collectible resources. Chat. I'm just a chat, Jerry. What?
[1578.84s -> 1590.62s]  What the fuck? Holy shit. Okay. Wait, who's this guy? He was spy for the Dubose Empire.
[1590.62s -> 1603.88s]  You're just the new- Do you want to fucking go? Why am I fighting this guy?
[1609.14s -> 1623.91s]  What? Wait, what? He killed me in one hit. Okay. Wait, there's a dodge roll? All right. Hold on.
[1623.91s -> 1630.26s]  This game just got way cooler. This is the Porsche Times. We're sponsored by the city government and
[1630.26s -> 1635.38s]  the local commerce guild branch to bring you the latest news in our city. For free. We're a monthly
[1635.38s -> 1639.14s]  publication, so papers will be sent out on the first day of each month. If you have any questions
[1639.22s -> 1648.78s]  or concerns, please do not hesitate to visit our office on Main Street. Okay. Cool. I feel like
[1648.78s -> 1653.98s]  this is something I was doing in front of the green screen. You lost the tutorial fight. I did
[1653.98s -> 1657.42s]  not lose- There's no tutorial fight, but what I'll tell you is I'm turning the music down
[1658.46s -> 1667.53s]  because it's very loud. That's better. All right. Go to the commerce guild. Let's go. Is there a
[1667.53s -> 1675.90s]  sprint? What is it? All right. I'm just gonna- Let me- The glowing objects are- What glowing
[1675.90s -> 1684.84s]  objects? That motherfucker's got a sword. All right. Glow- Oh, wait. Is it a glowing object?
[1684.84s -> 1701.35s]  What's that? Is it a fountain? What was that? Somebody just robbed a bank? Okay. Meet Presley.
[1711.58s -> 1720.01s]  Oh, I can't fight him. I can't fight the mayor. What is RPS? Rock, paper, scissors?
[1722.30s -> 1729.85s]  Shit. All right. He just went, uh, scissors. I'm going hand again. Yep. You just went rock.
[1729.85s -> 1741.03s]  I'm going hand a third time. Yep. I win. I'm going with rock next. Believe him. I win. Now I get to
[1741.03s -> 1748.65s]  be the mayor. I was owned. Do I get any money? Okay. All right. So now meet- I gotta meet somebody
[1748.65s -> 1758.49s]  here. Where are they? Oh, this is not the commerce guild. This is like the president's house.
[1759.13s -> 1770.42s]  Well, it was- It was blinking on the screen. Oh, there it is. All right.
[1770.42s -> 1778.36s]  So now what do we have to do? Nice to see you. How are you settling in? I'm not- Not so good. Hang
[1778.36s -> 1784.20s]  in there. Let me introduce you to the commerce guild. Okay. We're the organization that orchestrates
[1784.20s -> 1790.68s]  trade across the entire free cities region. This is the Porsche branch. Okay. We're pretty busy
[1790.68s -> 1796.36s]  throughout the year. Okay. Now then, let me give you your builder test. This is- Do I have to
[1796.36s -> 1812.68s]  actually build stuff? All right. So I gotta go punch some trees. All right. All right. Builder
[1812.68s -> 1822.71s]  test. What's this? I'm in need of eight wooden baskets. Please help me. Not yet. Everybody needs
[1822.71s -> 1830.47s]  to leave me the fuck alone until I complete this. All right. So I gotta go Minecraft Elden Ring.
[1830.47s -> 1834.33s]  All right. So I gotta build an axe and build a pickaxe. So I need wooden stone.
[1835.05s -> 1842.02s]  So let me go out to town. I gotta get some wood. Do I have an energy bar or anything?
[1842.02s -> 1851.85s]  Where's my house? I don't remember where I live. Is this my house? Okay. Let's go get a tree. Yep.
[1852.57s -> 1876.20s]  Can I get- Okay. Let's go. Is this working? I just got fruit. Can I kick the tree down?
[1876.76s -> 1899.83s]  It needs to be a smaller tree like this one. Oh shit. Look. What the fuck is this? What? Wait.
[1899.83s -> 1914.44s]  There's level- What level am I? Whoa. All right. How do I get stuff? The glowing objects are the
[1914.44s -> 1921.05s]  collective- Where's the- What do you mean glowing objects? How do I cut a tree down? I need an axe.
[1921.69s -> 1940.46s]  How do I cut stuff down? Oh, wait. Oh, here we go. Okay. All right. All right. All right. There's
[1940.46s -> 1951.03s]  some wood. It's just on the ground. Is this shit? Why would I pick this up? Why would you touch this?
[1951.03s -> 1970.78s]  Well, at least I have gloves on. How much wood do I need to build a- Hit the left stick? Oh, okay.
[1971.85s -> 1975.13s]  All right. I've got eight wood. I need some stone. Where do I get stone from?
[1978.49s -> 1981.93s]  Fight the llamas. No, I'm level one. They're level five. They're going to kick the shit out of me.
[1981.93s -> 1989.30s]  Why would I do that? That'd be stupid. Go steal it from people. No, it's definitely on the ground.
[1989.86s -> 2008.70s]  What is this? Oh, I can- It's like a trap? Lettuce and cumin will get you a- Okay. All right. I got
[2008.70s -> 2015.64s]  three. I need a- I need some stone. Is there a map button I can press? Oh, what's this?
[2016.28s -> 2026.36s]  Caterpillar and herbs. Look at that caterpillar. It looks cool. You already have shit in your
[2026.36s -> 2040.34s]  inventory because I picked it up. I don't know. Wait. Treasure chest. Ahoy. Okay. You can't
[2041.70s -> 2048.26s]  touch the water. How am I supposed to do that then? Really? Oh my God. All right. I need the
[2048.26s -> 2064.74s]  stones. I'm just like a little weird guy. You picked up four shits already. What can I do with
[2064.74s -> 2071.14s]  them? You can probably use them for something. Level seven snail lob. I can't fight a snail lob.
[2071.14s -> 2088.86s]  Not right now. Not at level one. Stone. Right here. Shit. You can definitely do it. All right.
[2088.86s -> 2095.59s]  Whatever these are, I'll fight them. Level tw- No. Nope. Never mind. Not doing that.
[2096.31s -> 2113.29s]  I just need some rocks. Ah, here we go. Is these rocks? Shell and sand. Okay. Where are the rocks?
[2114.09s -> 2118.33s]  Look at the top left. You can craft items on your work- Yeah, I know, but I need stone first.
[2119.21s -> 2134.92s]  Don't fuck around. It's by the house. What? It's probably close to the town. Yeah, that's what I
[2134.92s -> 2141.78s]  figured, but it's not there. Is he playing Breath of the Wild? No. This is my time at Porsche.
[2141.78s -> 2146.90s]  That's a chill game for a chill day because I might have COVID, so I'm just trying to relax.
[2148.98s -> 2157.59s]  It's possible. This isn't even my house. Whose fucking house is this? Where's my map?
[2161.42s -> 2174.90s]  Where's my house? How do I see the map? M. What is that on the controller? This is my house?
[2175.46s -> 2192.04s]  Where's my house? Okay. There we go. It's marked. Good. Look at these things. Mr. Ladybug? Are you
[2192.04s -> 2209.08s]  kidding me? All right. Wait. Give me this fruits and this fruit. All right. I got three apples. Nice.
[2209.64s -> 2217.40s]  This is like watching my grandpa play. Like, I like- What? Like, you could do any better?
[2219.72s -> 2228.23s]  Okay. Here we are. What? I can- Wait. Can I take- Can I have one of these?
[2231.77s -> 2234.97s]  What the fuck? No. Put it down. Put it down. How do I put it down? How do I put it down?
[2234.97s -> 2241.78s]  They don't want to kill me. I just aggroed the whole farm. They're like, yeah, don't ever do
[2241.78s -> 2257.83s]  that again. Get out of here. Okay. I'm going to keep going. All right. Here's my house.
[2257.83s -> 2268.01s]  I still don't have enough stone. I have to go to bed soon. All right. Let's see. Craft. Simple axe.
[2268.01s -> 2274.74s]  I need stone and wood from quarry and abandoned ruins. Okay. Where's a quarry?
[2278.07s -> 2289.13s]  You're failing the tutorial. Where- Where- There's no rocks anywhere. There's herbs and spices.
[2298.94s -> 2313.42s]  Fishing spot. Should I go up to like the- Go to town? Flower shop? Where are the other cookies?
[2313.42s -> 2320.57s]  Your inventory is full right now. And the ruins. Yeah, but I could just go to quarry too. I don't
[2320.57s -> 2330.31s]  want to go to the- All the way to the ruins. Like I don't want to like- Okay. I'll go there
[2330.31s -> 2337.22s]  tomorrow morning. I gotta get familiar with the map. I haven't even played the game for five minutes.
[2345.86s -> 2358.63s]  Oh, I can fix this. Yeah. Do it. Here we go. I can get more wood tomorrow. 20 wood. Nice. Okay. I'll
[2358.63s -> 2371.53s]  go to bed. I don't like where that bed is. How do I put it down? Okay. That's fine. Homescapes.
[2376.26s -> 2384.28s]  This house is so worn. I need to fix it. All right. I did. Do I have a chest I can put stuff away in?
[2387.54s -> 2393.75s]  Okay. There are rocks scattered around the house and- Yeah. Where- I don't-
[2394.55s -> 2399.43s]  Okay. I- This- They spawned. These weren't here before. Look. These were not here before. They
[2399.43s -> 2408.68s]  spawned here. You got a skill point? Cool. Yep. Chillin' and leveling. That's what I want to see.
[2409.91s -> 2415.05s]  These weren't here before. Look at these. These literally were not here. I swear to God. I would
[2415.05s -> 2428.22s]  have seen them. All right. I can do the axe. Axe and pickaxe. He's got delirium. I'm fine. All
[2428.22s -> 2431.90s]  right. This is from the town hall. Hello, new builder. We'd like to remind you that Porsche
[2431.90s -> 2436.86s]  currently has two authorized ruins for you to dive in. An abandoned room number one below the
[2436.86s -> 2440.06s]  Church of the Light and the Hazardous Ruin in the collapsed wasteland east of town.
[2441.18s -> 2447.70s]  I- I didn't have this info before. You guys get it? Come on. All right. How do I put stuff? I need
[2447.70s -> 2466.87s]  to make some shit. All right. Simple axe. I need one more stone. This was not here yesterday. Okay.
[2467.51s -> 2470.47s]  Can I- How do I expand my inventory? Can I look and see what I have in my inventory?
[2471.03s -> 2473.83s]  Well, on the controller. Because I want to play with controller.
[2477.34s -> 2481.91s]  This dude's hallucinating. Simple- All right. Let's make this at least.
[2483.66s -> 2491.38s]  Okay. Simple axe. One. All right. So now, where's my inventory?
[2494.28s -> 2503.48s]  I need to wake up. Now, I need a simple axe and I need a pickaxe. There we go.
[2504.97s -> 2511.05s]  I have the first builder test is complete. Now, who do I turn this into? This- What the fuck?
[2511.05s -> 2524.28s]  I thought he's coming to fight me. Oh, they work it out. Cool. Can I do this too? What's over here?
[2524.28s -> 2535.64s]  Hey. Excellent quality. Nicely done. You can keep them. I just wanted to see what you can do.
[2535.64s -> 2553.96s]  Okay. Okay. Flip through his workshop handbook. Okay. So, I need to make a stone furnace.
[2555.34s -> 2557.90s]  Very nice. All right. Pass the test. Stone furnace time.
[2559.42s -> 2562.86s]  Should I talk to people? Sister of the Church of the Light.
[2568.86s -> 2584.65s]  Goodbye. Who are you? Emily. Next door neighbor.
[2589.26s -> 2603.32s]  Okay. Let's chat. Pumpkin pie? Oh, cool. I forgot. This is- We're in like a rural town.
[2603.96s -> 2609.03s]  I'm thinking neighbor. Oh, cool. Neighbor. You might be six miles down the road.
[2610.79s -> 2619.91s]  All right. What do I need for this? Welcome to my workshop. Handbook's first page.
[2619.99s -> 2623.35s]  I'm going to try to write down all the knowledge that I'm going to gain as I tackle this workshop
[2623.35s -> 2635.88s]  business. Since I'm probably the- False alarm. I'm the one who's going to read this. Hello.
[2635.88s -> 2643.43s]  To me, handsome guy. Okay. Go up to the assembly station podium. Open up this handbook and select
[2643.43s -> 2649.98s]  a diagram. Once the framework of the item appears, I can start placing the different parts.
[2650.62s -> 2656.46s]  To install a party, to have the part in my hands. All right. Cool. So, let's do it. Item catalog.
[2658.01s -> 2666.79s]  Stone furnace. Stones can be- All right. What kind of fucking book is this?
[2667.77s -> 2672.41s]  Just write instructions. Why did you do a bunch of weird drawings and place it like a Microsoft
[2672.41s -> 2676.41s]  Word document? Like just write, hey, this is what you do and this is what it looks like on the other
[2676.41s -> 2684.79s]  side. All right. With relevant part equipped, aim at the silhouette of the construct and press
[2684.79s -> 2689.93s]  A or X. Okay. Assembly station console can be used to view material requirements, right?
[2690.65s -> 2695.37s]  Parts can be installed. Yeah. Yeah. Overcovered. Yeah. We all know how to do that. All right. We
[2695.37s -> 2703.54s]  get it. All right. So, now I need assembly station. I don't want a grinder. Did I pick grinder?
[2705.99s -> 2723.06s]  Stone furnace. How do I pick this thing? Oh. All right. Pick that. I want this. I don't want
[2723.06s -> 2743.27s]  a grinder. I want a furnace. Furnace. No, I don't want a grinder. Furnace. Choose. Okay.
[2746.28s -> 2752.33s]  Oh, wait. How do I get to my inventory? Is it I? All right. There's buttons that don't- Oh,
[2752.33s -> 2762.55s]  not on the controller, guys. I think I need wood. Let's go get some wood. Character. Ooh,
[2762.55s -> 2767.90s]  skill points. Oh, different- There's a Diablo 2 skill tree in this game. Okay.
[2772.50s -> 2782.12s]  Uh, what should I do? Fight, gathering, or social? 20% should receive one additional
[2782.12s -> 2786.50s]  relationship point. Receive one additional relationship point. Increase the workshop
[2786.50s -> 2794.46s]  points by one. Okay. Fight. Experience gained by 5%. Endurance issues decreased. Endurance.
[2796.81s -> 2800.09s]  I gotta be careful, though. I don't want to go all the way down this tree and get to the end
[2800.09s -> 2805.34s]  of the discipline tree that the priest had in classic WoW and literally have a worthless talent
[2805.34s -> 2810.04s]  tree. What was that thing all the way at the end? All the way at the end of the discipline
[2810.04s -> 2821.14s]  priest tree? It was like, give somebody 20% more- No, it was make all spells for a casted target
[2821.14s -> 2827.34s]  20% reduced mana cost. It was like, what a fucking piece of shit. What was it called? What was that
[2827.34s -> 2836.73s]  move called? Power Infusion. Yeah, that spell sucked absolute balls. It was terrible. And it
[2836.73s -> 2847.99s]  was the last spell at the end of the discipline tree. You suck- Hey, come on. It's good. Yeah,
[2847.99s -> 2854.95s]  in like 2020 WoW, in like 2005 WoW, that move was like, what the fuck are you even going to
[2854.95s -> 2869.22s]  give that to? It was terrible. I think I want to do gathering. Stamina cost decreases by 25% when
[2869.22s -> 2875.85s]  using the axe. Tree kicking and harvesting activities have a- All right, I'm gonna be
[2875.85s -> 2886.01s]  harvesting Andy. Let's go with the axe. Nice. Okay, so I gotta use the axe now. This is cool.
[2886.01s -> 2892.90s]  All right, missions. Very cool. All right, inventory. Let's get this shit out of the way.
[2892.90s -> 2904.44s]  So I gotta use my axe for shit. And it's an attack too. It hurts. What should I do with this?
[2904.44s -> 2910.73s]  I can convert this into money? All right, so that's good so far. I don't think I- Let me maybe an
[2910.73s -> 2918.49s]  apple to eat it. Maybe I get some whatever. I just saw what it looked like. All right, this is good.
[2918.49s -> 2926.65s]  Okay, I've got the axe now. You get a little window thing here. All right, so now I need some
[2926.65s -> 2931.35s]  more- I need wood. Let's go cut some trees down and I need a little bit more stone. This seems fun,
[2931.35s -> 2958.26s]  man. What? I need a better axe. Okay, there we go. I can cut this down. Cool. Do these- Does the axe
[2958.26s -> 2970.86s]  have durability? No, it's good forever. All right, this is- Okay, now I'm- Now we're working. Now
[2970.86s -> 2983.62s]  we're going- Stop deforesting to the land to make your white bread factory. You know what's
[2983.62s -> 2992.14s]  that kind of cra- Like, I can't- All right, what you said is so funny because I- We don't need
[2992.14s -> 2997.58s]  any more white bread factories, right? Think about that. There's really not a need for that at all.
[2997.58s -> 3012.39s]  Zero need for it. There are so many different brands of white bread that- Why would you ever
[3012.39s -> 3020.25s]  make a white bread company? Even a bread company? Especially white bread. Yeah, I got an idea. I'm
[3020.25s -> 3028.28s]  going to get into the white bread business. Dude, I would probably highly suggest you don't.
[3028.28s -> 3044.22s]  No, I can't do that yet. How much should I get? Do I have enough? You look like you'd eat white
[3044.22s -> 3049.70s]  bread with olives on it. I like white bread. I do. I'm not going to be one of these people
[3049.70s -> 3055.86s]  that sits here and tells you, oh, white bread is disgusting. Gross. I like whole wheat bread. Oh,
[3055.86s -> 3063.70s]  stop. It's- White toast is incredible. White toast is very good. So is wheat toast. So is
[3063.70s -> 3072.31s]  rye bread. Why do we have to be so weird about this? It's like, okay, you know when you go to
[3072.31s -> 3077.11s]  a breakfast place and for some reason people that order, when they order a breakfast,
[3077.83s -> 3081.19s]  I see people get weird when they do this. So you sit there, it's like, oh, what do you want?
[3081.19s -> 3085.19s]  I'll take the hash and eggs and okay, and I'll take an orange juice. Oh, what kind of toast would
[3085.19s -> 3090.31s]  you like? And it's almost like they close, they close the book. They close the restaurant, you
[3090.31s -> 3095.91s]  know, menu and they kind of puff their chest up and they're like, rye bread, please. Oh, you're
[3095.91s -> 3106.31s]  getting rye bread this time. And then when I order white bread, it's like, okay, white bread.
[3107.03s -> 3125.26s]  What are you, fucking 12? No one does this. Yeah, I know people do this because I do this.
[3125.98s -> 3130.54s]  I have ordered at a breakfast place and when they have all the bread options, I'm just like,
[3130.54s -> 3136.06s]  ah, you know, how about a nice sourdough? Even though I don't fucking care. And then the sourdough
[3136.06s -> 3139.58s]  comes out and I'm like, I don't even fucking want that. I just wanted people to think I was
[3139.82s -> 3153.75s]  not like 12 because I ordered white bread every time. I eat it. Don't act like I don't eat it.
[3157.18s -> 3164.12s]  Do you have taste buds? Yeah, exactly. You're the exact person that is a white bread hater.
[3164.86s -> 3169.34s]  And when somebody orders a white bread at a restaurant, you internally, even if you don't
[3169.34s -> 3174.78s]  say it, you go, I ordered wheat bread. You do. You're definitely the person that does that.
[3178.84s -> 3194.23s]  I have to be holding it. Okay. I don't like that you have to be holding the item.
[3194.23s -> 3201.54s]  Okay. 10 wood and then I need some stone. All right. I need another. You need to be.
[3202.50s -> 3216.41s]  I have it right? Stone stool. How do you make a stone stool? Oh, storage. Yeah. Give me this one.
[3217.69s -> 3223.62s]  Stone storage. Stone stool. Okay. I just need a bunch of stone. Where should I put this?
[3225.14s -> 3236.97s]  People can't steal, right? There we go. All right. Uh, fast exchange. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[3236.97s -> 3242.79s]  I'll probably need this for something eventually. Tree sap. Yeah.
[3242.79s -> 3246.50s]  Plant fiber. I'm definitely gonna need this for something. But for now, let's keep it like this.
[3246.50s -> 3255.85s]  All right. Cool. So I need to get more stone. Why do people hate white bread? I don't think
[3255.85s -> 3259.13s]  people hate it. I think it just, it got a really bad rap because people started to realize that
[3259.13s -> 3264.33s]  white bread is like the same in your body as cotton candy, essentially. So people just kind
[3264.33s -> 3269.91s]  of treat it like shit because your body just doesn't really do anything with it. But you know,
[3269.91s -> 3283.77s]  whatever. All right. Give me some stones. White bread is kind of like cake. That's fake news.
[3284.33s -> 3287.21s]  No, it's not. It's not. It's not. Can somebody clarify if that's fake news?
[3288.33s -> 3292.49s]  Your body thinks that white bread is just sugar, essentially, is all it thinks, right?
[3298.82s -> 3302.50s]  I mean, it still has some qualities to it, but your body kind of treats it the same way,
[3302.50s -> 3306.84s]  doesn't it? It's just straight up carbohydrates. It's all it is. It's just nothing else.
[3311.05s -> 3316.17s]  That's all bread, though. No, but like whole wheat bread has, you know, fiber in it. It's got,
[3316.25s -> 3323.90s]  it's got like vitamins and shit. Like whole wheat bread is much better for you, right? Multi-grain.
[3323.90s -> 3331.37s]  They all actually, they have like some material. Get on the road. Get on the road. What are you
[3331.37s -> 3340.46s]  doing? This guy's driving in circles. Are you all right? I thought you were sleeping. I saw this.
[3340.46s -> 3364.82s]  I thought it was Z's. Hey, I can actually walk faster than this bus is driving. This guy's not
[3364.82s -> 3369.38s]  even on the road. All right. You're a fucking weirdo. All right. I need rocks. I gotta go to bed,
[3369.38s -> 3391.85s]  too. Stones. Quick. Where are the stones? I need stones. Play Elder Scrolls 6. It's not out yet.
[3398.23s -> 3401.83s]  Would you ever eat a gallon of mayonnaise for money? No, why would I do that? I don't want
[3401.83s -> 3408.47s]  to ruin mayo for myself. There is lots of things that I refuse to eat or drink because I don't want
[3408.47s -> 3416.39s]  it to ruin a thing that I like. A case in point, I don't, I will never put alcohol into orange juice.
[3417.11s -> 3421.83s]  I know that. Oh yeah, make it a screwdriver, a vodka and orange. No, thanks. No, because then
[3421.83s -> 3427.48s]  it'll make my brain think the taste of orange juice is gross. I love orange juice and I'm not
[3427.48s -> 3440.01s]  going to ruin it because I know that I'll be like, oh yeah, vodka and orange juice, vodka and orange
[3440.01s -> 3445.77s]  juice. That has tastes a certain way. But then I'll get up the next morning and be like, and I'll
[3445.77s -> 3454.92s]  reach for the orange juice because that's what I do. And I'll be like, no, no, no, no, no. What
[3454.92s -> 3462.97s]  about mimosas? No, no, thanks. I don't like drinking in the morning. I know people do it, but I don't
[3462.97s -> 3468.87s]  fucking know why or how. Let's drink a bunch of mimosas at like 10 o'clock in the morning. No,
[3469.75s -> 3483.00s]  no, I don't want to do that. That's too much. Okay, I need some more rocks. Yeah, mimosas,
[3483.00s -> 3487.00s]  they taste good. They're fine, but I don't want to drink at 10 o'clock in the morning.
[3488.97s -> 3492.25s]  I don't like Bloody Marys either for that same exact reason. It's like, it's like an 11 o'clock
[3492.25s -> 3507.02s]  in the morning drink. No, thanks. All right. Stone stool. Let's go. Got it. Okay. So now I got this.
[3507.02s -> 3517.82s]  It's time to do, I got this done. So now I can, oh, I get it. Let's put this in the corner over here.
[3520.10s -> 3526.82s]  So now make a stone furnace. All right. Now what? Can I call this guy on the phone? Do I have to go
[3526.82s -> 3538.62s]  keep talking to this guy? Why don't I, I don't have a cell phone number at this point. Hey.
[3542.36s -> 3548.44s]  Okay. This is your builder license. Now you just need to take this license over to the
[3548.44s -> 3554.36s]  mayor's office and get your workshop registered. Cool. Start taking regular commissions.
[3554.36s -> 3560.76s]  Come back and talk with me. All right. Register. I got my registration. It's my diploma.
[3566.89s -> 3576.82s]  Actually doing the tutorial went wrong place. Sorry. Do you like pulp? No, I do. I really don't.
[3578.82s -> 3587.96s]  Welcome. Welcome. I'm here to register my workshop very well. What is the name of your workshop?
[3588.60s -> 3617.24s]  The steak and eggs workshop. Uh, steak and eggs. I just like want that. That's the only reason why
[3617.24s -> 3632.76s]  I'm typing that in. I want to eat that right now. Steak and eggs, the wonder bread factory.
[3634.12s -> 3660.98s]  White bread, Emporium, white bread, bread. Um, no, not glue factory. I'm not going to name it
[3660.98s -> 3673.94s]  wonder bread. Jerry's bread. I actually like Jerry's bread a lot. Oh, come on there. Jerry's
[3673.94s -> 3689.99s]  bread by Jerry. Registration. I have to make bread. Can I make bread? Thank you. So we're going to
[3689.99s -> 3697.80s]  fireside town meeting. Okay. They'll be announced through the mail. All right. So we get events,
[3697.80s -> 3721.30s]  town events. By the way, I'm the new mayor. Okay. So now the game has opened up. Let's go in here.
[3725.56s -> 3737.62s]  You did it. Wow. Shop owner. Let me explain some of the processes for our trade.
[3737.62s -> 3743.78s]  I got to make bread office. We post workshop commissions on the board over there based on
[3743.78s -> 3748.66s]  the speed and quality of the results. We make ranking ranking of the workshops listed on the
[3748.74s -> 3756.02s]  wall behind me. There are other workshops in Porsche. Oh, yes. Adding yours, there will be
[3756.02s -> 3761.70s]  what? Why are you making us fight for dominance with each other? What are you talking about?
[3761.70s -> 3767.27s]  Which is listed on your license. The higher your rating, the higher the commissions you can get.
[3767.27s -> 3771.88s]  This is fucked up. But don't if you have your father's once you're done with your orders,
[3771.88s -> 3776.68s]  you can pick up the commission fee from Antoine. If it's from the or the respective person who
[3777.16s -> 3781.80s]  do commissions through the Commerce Guild, but some just build items and sell directly to the
[3781.80s -> 3786.60s]  market. Some just build items and sell directly. All right, let's let's make it easy. Since this
[3786.60s -> 3795.08s]  is your first commission, I've kept one just for you. Playing favorites are we evil, evil guy,
[3795.08s -> 3801.72s]  evil, evil guy. There are never too many commissions. Good day. That's runt. He's
[3801.72s -> 3806.60s]  the owner of the current number one workshop. Brilliant businessman, but I don't like the way
[3806.60s -> 3814.52s]  he does things. Well, I'm sorry. That was our last one today. Hey, press. I've got a job for you.
[3814.52s -> 3821.13s]  Or not. What a pushover this guy is. You own this place. You could literally say, Hey,
[3821.69s -> 3827.53s]  hey, runt, give me that paperback, or you're banned for life from this premises. Give me
[3827.53s -> 3836.58s]  the paperback now. Banned for life. If you don't just say just take it back. Oh, he took it. I
[3836.58s -> 3842.26s]  just run things here. I own this place. I own literally all of this fucking snatch that back
[3842.90s -> 3849.74s]  and go banned for life. You want to get banned for life. Give me that back. We're looking to
[3849.74s -> 3859.88s]  build a bridge. So the mayor put up the money. The year is up for the challenge. Okay, Arlo. Yeah,
[3859.88s -> 3863.64s]  he figured that place could be a real tourist attraction. What with the haunted cave at all?
[3864.44s -> 3869.32s]  Haunted cave workshop handbook to see if he has a bridge diagram. Well, one thing at a time.
[3871.24s -> 3876.28s]  If it's there, use it at your assembly station. Okay. After you're done with the bridge pieces,
[3876.28s -> 3882.12s]  you'll need to go to the designated spot and assemble the bridge. Also, and this is important
[3882.12s -> 3887.64s]  for a project as big as a bridge. You'll probably need to dive into the abandoned ruins to gather
[3887.64s -> 3903.06s]  materials. All right. And I'm gonna keep doing that. Okay, so what's my workshop rank? Higgins
[3903.06s -> 3914.76s]  workshop. Alan Carter works tooth fairy factory. Neighbor Wang's and Jerry's bread. I'm D rank.
[3923.46s -> 3932.79s]  All right, I got to get to the ruins. Get some stuff. Steal from the library. Okay, I got to
[3932.79s -> 3938.90s]  build the bridge. Wait, there's another quest over here. What's this? Church store?
[3951.08s -> 3958.01s]  Okay, so you want flowers? How about rock, paper, scissors? I thought there was an animal here.
[3958.65s -> 3964.71s]  I just saw this. I was like, why is there a bear just standing up? I was like, who is this bear?
[3971.16s -> 3982.79s]  Church of the light. Okay, what are you selling? Hello, our church only take relics
[3982.79s -> 3991.32s]  from the age of corruption. All right, seeds, rainbow flower. Do I have $97? How much does this
[3991.32s -> 4007.48s]  cost? It's all seasons. Apricot tree. Okay. Need large planner box from the church of light. I
[4007.48s -> 4018.90s]  don't have enough items to exchange. What? Why do you want like old CDs? Oh my god, this 10 grand.
[4018.90s -> 4036.02s]  Why do you want old CDs? I'm not doing that ever again. I promise. All right, I got plenty of
[4036.02s -> 4039.70s]  daylight. Abandoned ruins. We got to go get materials. Let's do it. I was gonna pick up
[4039.70s -> 4048.15s]  everything. Hey there. First time ruin diving? Yep. All righty. Let me explain then. All the
[4048.15s -> 4053.67s]  ruins in the alliance of free cities are regulated by we said like an open to enter the ruins. You'll
[4053.67s -> 4058.55s]  need to pay a weekly maintenance fee, but we'll give you a 60% discount. How much does this cost?
[4060.09s -> 4066.17s]  When you enter, I'll give you the jetpack and scanner. Very handy ancient relics. Mine info
[4066.17s -> 4071.45s]  resources becomes a lot easier when you have these equipped. This one beside me is an abandoned
[4071.45s -> 4078.33s]  ruin. No monsters or robots in there. Just resources and relics like power stones. Anything you find in
[4078.33s -> 4083.77s]  the ruins are yours to keep unless they're ancient weapons. Then we're supposed to hand them over to
[4083.77s -> 4088.57s]  the church for destruction. I don't want to hand it over to the church. I don't know. I don't trust
[4088.57s -> 4094.73s]  those people right now. I don't know who they are. They want old like rewritable CDs. I don't know
[4094.73s -> 4102.89s]  what they want. Okay. Okay. I'm done. Have fun and be safe in there. Anything dangerous in there?
[4102.89s -> 4108.92s]  Could I trip and fall? A workshop owner can make money through commerce guild commissions. All right.
[4108.92s -> 4116.12s]  So let me just go in and check it out. 20 gold to switch to another area of the abandoned ruins.
[4117.00s -> 4137.24s]  Wait. Wait. Hold on. No, no, no. I'm just gonna walk in. $80 for a weekly pass. I don't have a
[4137.96s -> 4145.83s]  shovel. No, it's not. I'm fine. I'm okay. Left trigger R2 to scan with the relic scanner.
[4145.83s -> 4162.04s]  A nearby relic will show up as globes of light. Okay. I have a jet pack too. Oh, shit. All right.
[4162.04s -> 4184.49s]  Let's go. Can I just hit anything? Do I have to dig anywhere? Use the scanner?
[4190.52s -> 4203.94s]  I look like a psycho. You can just dig. Can I? I kind of want to see if there's anything over here though.
[4210.94s -> 4227.03s]  I can just hit the what? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I can just go in a random direction. Whoa.
[4227.03s -> 4260.71s]  All right. That's kind of cool. This takes a lot of energy. Anything in here? Oh, there are
[4263.40s -> 4287.86s]  8.6 meters this way. All right. Let's go. What is it? It's a box. Can I pick it up? I remember
[4287.86s -> 4291.38s]  Remington mentioned something about this. Something about talking to the church. Oh, it's a
[4291.38s -> 4308.70s]  disk. It's data disks. Okay. That's where you find them. There's another one down here. Is it only
[4308.70s -> 4320.50s]  data disks? I'm not gonna get trapped down here. Oh, power stone and old parts. How much stamina
[4320.50s -> 4330.86s]  do I have? I'm gonna try to make it over here. Can I just mark them all? All right. I gotta mark
[4330.86s -> 4353.78s]  one at a time. This one's closer. Oh, there's a stone in here. We have to turn disks into monsters.
[4353.78s -> 4363.75s]  Hey, isn't there a new monster rancher coming out? Oh, I got a relic. All right. I'm almost out of
[4363.75s -> 4399.00s]  energy. There's one more right here. There is. Yeah. Another relic. Okay. For those of you that
[4399.00s -> 4404.95s]  are wondering, I have a button that I can press if I need to like sneeze or like cough or make
[4404.95s -> 4409.35s]  a gross sound so you won't hear it and you won't see it. All right. I'm almost out of energy so I
[4409.35s -> 4421.27s]  don't want to get stuck down here. Stop picking your nose. I'm not. All right. I got a bunch of
[4421.27s -> 4430.90s]  cool stuff. Oh, I can open the map and return it. All right. That's fine. That's pretty cool. All
[4430.90s -> 4444.76s]  right. So I have a data research center. All right. I got a lot of stuff to do. I kind of want the
[4446.12s -> 4455.54s]  I really like to have the jetpack now. All right. Head over there. I got I got enough stone to make
[4455.54s -> 4470.90s]  the furnace. What's that pig? I like it. I like this game. This game's pretty fun. Wait, we have
[4470.90s -> 4490.12s]  a quest. The farmer. Okay. Sure. What's up? It's great. Can you build it and test it out for me?
[4490.12s -> 4498.62s]  If it works as advertised, I'll order a few more off of you. How about it? Should I do it? Thank
[4498.62s -> 4504.22s]  you. Here's the craft recipe and here are a few seeds to plant. If you want more seeds, you can
[4504.22s -> 4510.14s]  buy them from my granny's shop. Try growing them to maturity and show me the harvest. Also, I have a
[4510.14s -> 4522.63s]  tip for you. Using fertilizer will help increase the harvest. Welcome to the round table. Chef's
[4522.63s -> 4536.63s]  choice. Oh, cheap soda. Apricot juice. Should I get a plate? Rainbow lemonade. Defense. All right.
[4536.63s -> 4544.58s]  Let's get the attack one. How do I not have enough? Oh, what happened to my money? Didn't I have 95
[4544.58s -> 4560.79s]  or $97? I don't get it. And Sergillian offner. The all-knowing. Did I get robbed? Why did I
[4560.79s -> 4566.14s]  lose all that money? Did I? What did I buy? You spent? Oh, that's right. It was 80 bucks for the
[4566.14s -> 4572.58s]  week. Okay. All right. Let me go to uh, who do I need to turn this into? One of these people.
[4575.96s -> 4601.35s]  Okay. I got a, you have a turn in here. You have a turn in here. Let's go. Hello. Nevermind. I don't
[4601.35s -> 4606.87s]  have anything I want to give you that I want to part with. I'm busy. Go ask Petra. I just tried to
[4606.87s -> 4615.40s]  talk to Petra. What do we have here? Data disk. Do you say data or data? I say data. You know what
[4615.40s -> 4622.34s]  it is. You want to know. It's actually related to how you can discover new diagrams. Data. No,
[4622.34s -> 4631.93s]  it's data. Many relics in this world are beyond our current understanding. Wait,
[4631.93s -> 4640.47s]  so are we like a thousand years in the future? These data disks are located all around the world.
[4640.47s -> 4644.07s]  They hold lots of useful information. I don't, I don't think I'd want to play these.
[4647.43s -> 4652.47s]  Do you know how, okay, do you know how many of these exist that are just a shitty playlist
[4653.27s -> 4662.68s]  from like 1999? Like eight tracks on it. They're gonna, they're gonna find these and it's gonna
[4662.68s -> 4667.10s]  find, it's gonna be like, oh yeah, what's on this one? They're gonna play it and it's gonna be a
[4667.10s -> 4676.90s]  burnt copy of like Sum 41, their studio album, their debut album. Oh, it's another Sum 41 album.
[4676.90s -> 4691.27s]  Okay. Put it in a list. Put it on the pile over there. Yeah, Hoobastank. Yeah. Weezer.
[4691.99s -> 4700.57s]  And some of them would be like, oh, what's on this one? And they'll put it in
[4701.37s -> 4705.45s]  and it'll just be nothing. And they'll realize, oh, this person fucked up this disc.
[4706.17s -> 4709.99s]  It says there's some data on it, but we can't even get it. Like they probably screwed up the
[4709.99s -> 4719.16s]  burn process. I remember burning CDs and it was just, sometimes it would just mess up. I wouldn't
[4719.16s -> 4723.88s]  do it right. And I would have to do it like four or five times to finally get the thing I wanted.
[4723.88s -> 4731.48s]  And it's just like, what the hell? When rewritables came out, that was a big deal because
[4731.48s -> 4740.57s]  you could go over everything. We're not miracle workers, so don't expect us to come up with things
[4740.57s -> 4744.81s]  from scratch. But we do know a thing or two about how the components should fit together.
[4746.09s -> 4752.57s]  Anyway, just remember that if you find any data discs, bring them to you this time. Wait, so I
[4752.57s -> 4758.81s]  can bring data discs to you or I can bring them to the church. This must be a piece of a relic.
[4758.81s -> 4763.29s]  You can use our recovery machine in the research center to restore it to its original shape.
[4764.17s -> 4777.54s]  Okay. Data discs. Stop saying data discs. It's data. There's data on here.
[4781.99s -> 4782.79s]  Didn't I already hand it in?
[4787.51s -> 4788.55s]  Age of Corruption.
[4788.63s -> 4794.71s]  Back in the age of corruption, it is highly dangerous because there's a chance this little
[4794.71s -> 4800.95s]  item here could contain the blueprint for Armageddon. It can't be that bad, right?
[4802.70s -> 4809.34s]  You're what? 18? 19? The age of darkness is probably just another fairy tale story to you,
[4809.34s -> 4815.82s]  right? When I was young, my great-grandma shared her first-hand account of the time before Peach,
[4815.82s -> 4821.10s]  the time when folks lived in ruins underground. The dark age of technology?
[4821.10s -> 4826.06s]  Everybody fought each other over the most basic of things, and people were considered old if they
[4826.06s -> 4836.39s]  had to live to 30. And it was always, always dark. Wait, what? What are we doing? Imagine that,
[4836.39s -> 4841.19s]  because that's what the end of the world looked like. That situation was created by the very same
[4841.19s -> 4849.56s]  sort of dark technologies stored inside this little disc. Anyhow, I'm not trying to scare you,
[4850.12s -> 4855.80s]  but it's the reality of your builder business. Dangerous technologies are spread all over the
[4855.80s -> 4862.20s]  world, waiting to be stumbled upon and rediscovered. Places like the Research Center and cities like
[4862.20s -> 4870.60s]  Vega V expedite their recovery. Calamity will strike again. Mark my words. So, it's a priority
[4870.60s -> 4874.68s]  of the church to seek out and destroy all the destroy them. All right, so we're gonna pick a
[4874.68s -> 4881.08s]  side. Ruin divers such as yourself, of course. Yeah, do we do we want to collect all the Hoobastank
[4881.08s -> 4887.83s]  burnt CDs, or do we want to destroy them? So, I can give this to you. Yes, yes, that's right.
[4887.83s -> 4893.67s]  The church will reward you handsomely for your efforts. We have in our possessions a vast amount
[4893.67s -> 4900.71s]  of green technology learned through the ages. Wait a minute, I know that look. The church isn't
[4900.71s -> 4906.07s]  against the use of good technology that can bring telesis to our society. We're only against
[4906.07s -> 4917.80s]  dangerous technology. What kind of green technology? Mostly special seeds. Special seeds. We can share
[4917.80s -> 4924.52s]  what we have with you as you bring us more discs. You do know how to plant. Destroy them. Don't
[4925.16s -> 4931.82s]  trust the church. I don't know. Yeah, I destroy them. I think I want to keep them.
[4932.46s -> 4936.68s]  Oh dear, you should ask your neighbor how to farm. Yeah, all right, all right.
[4938.20s -> 4944.70s]  Okay, so now I got to make a choice here. Do I want to be with the church? Who are these people?
[4944.70s -> 4953.40s]  Hi, Phyllis. Oh, who might you be? This is a nurse. This is Dr. Zhu's assistant. Hi. How does
[4953.40s -> 4960.20s]  someone's mental health affect one's physical being? I'm sorry, I was miles away. If you have
[4960.20s -> 4967.29s]  an ailment, please come to the clinic. Okay, I'm gonna play rock, paper, scissors. Okay,
[4968.41s -> 4985.51s]  how about this? Oh, come on. There it is. All right, there it is. One more. I win. Oh well,
[4985.51s -> 4992.46s]  stupid game. What do you mean stupid game? It's to see you again. How are you settling in?
[4994.89s -> 5008.57s]  Okay, all right, I guess I have shit to do. I gotta leave. Stupid game. All right, one more rock,
[5008.57s -> 5025.27s]  paper, scissors for the road. Nobody's gonna go fist every time. I mean, I got owned. Yeah,
[5025.27s -> 5032.58s]  you did. My games just crashed. Okay, I need to I need to go figure out what I can make here.
[5034.95s -> 5042.84s]  It's also time to go to bed. It's late at night. Wait, I have a skill point. Oh, shit. Okay,
[5042.84s -> 5061.59s]  I have two skill points. I think I'm gonna do this. Yeah, I want to do I want to be able to
[5061.59s -> 5074.12s]  gather shit. There's a treasure chest. There is. I thought it was a piece of wood.
[5074.84s -> 5093.24s]  I've got two apricots. Jesus. Cool. He's vaping off camera. I'm just like making fat clouds.
[5095.48s -> 5116.57s]  Okay, let's go back home. I think I got a lot done today. He's eating nicotine packages.
[5117.93s -> 5132.89s]  Dermot, why are you playing this? Because I'm just chilling, man. I'm just chilling. I'm fairly ill.
[5133.77s -> 5141.30s]  So I'm just trying to just hang out and just chill with you guys. I keep muting and taking the
[5141.30s -> 5146.95s]  camera off because I'm like coughing or snorting and I don't want you to hear that. Okay, what can
[5146.95s -> 5161.53s]  I make? Let's go to bed first. I could build the bridge. Okay, that's the next task. Ding ding ding.
[5162.33s -> 5170.17s]  Let's go. Ooh, wait a minute. I think I have enough, right? I should. All right,
[5170.17s -> 5178.97s]  the house is almost fixed. 20 wood. There we go. I'm finally gonna have a good night's sleep.
[5181.51s -> 5198.66s]  Oh, I get it. Thinking about. Oh, no. Maybe false alarm. Hang up the license. Can I do that?
[5198.66s -> 5222.62s]  Oh, I can. All right. Yeah, let's put it right on over here. There. Jerry's bread. Workshop D.
[5222.62s -> 5231.70s]  Builder Jerry. This is the shit you get from the Build-A-Bear store. This doesn't really
[5231.70s -> 5250.42s]  mean anything right now. It's a cute house. All right. Bridge. Let's see. Assembly index.
[5252.09s -> 5264.44s]  Bridge head. All right, I need plank. Hardwood plank. Hardwood. I need a grinder.
[5265.32s -> 5276.97s]  Smelt with the furnace. Okay, so I need a grinder. Grinder. This gets so hot. Wait,
[5276.97s -> 5283.38s]  do I already have a grinder? Nope. Okay, copper bar. Dude, how am I supposed to make a co- I need
[5283.38s -> 5295.88s]  a- hold on. Copper bar. Let's go. Fuel depleted. I need refuel. How much is it wood? That's 20 hours.
[5295.88s -> 5301.16s]  Okay, I got 20 hours worth. Make- let's make a shitload of it, right? Why not? I have a ton of
[5301.16s -> 5313.90s]  it. Is it gonna take a day? What? It's gonna take a whole day. Get out of here. What else can I- do I
[5313.90s -> 5319.83s]  have any other materials? I need two old parts, three copper bars, and a grinding stone. All right,
[5319.83s -> 5329.11s]  I think I have old parts, don't I? Old parts. Yeah, okay. Well, let me put this on. Just do a
[5329.11s -> 5340.62s]  somersault. That was weird. I can't just place this one. All right, I gotta go back into that
[5340.62s -> 5349.54s]  thing. All right, I gotta go back to the dungeon. Wait, what do I- do I have anything in here?
[5351.80s -> 5360.46s]  Soil. All right, just move it over. Let me keep these. Small planter box. Learn to craft the
[5360.46s -> 5365.02s]  planter box. All right, I'm gonna hold on to this. I'm gonna store all this junk here, though.
[5365.82s -> 5372.38s]  Copper tin, wood, stone, power stone, old- yeah, I don't want to have a full inventory.
[5373.18s -> 5382.02s]  Fertilizer. I got all the seeds and shit. Okay, hold on. Shit. All right, all right, I think I'm
[5382.02s -> 5399.70s]  all right. What does the juice do? Ten- restore- restore ten stamina. Just drink it now. All right,
[5399.70s -> 5404.26s]  I need to go back and get more materials. I need- I need another old part, and then how do I make
[5404.26s -> 5415.75s]  the other thing? Grinding stone. All right, what's the handbook? How do I make a grinding stone? How
[5415.75s -> 5430.39s]  do I make a grinding stone? Grinding stone, grinding stone, grinding stone. There it is.
[5430.39s -> 5445.77s]  All right, I can make this. Let's make five. There. Cool. All right, now I gotta wait till
[5445.77s -> 5451.05s]  these- how many do I have? Zero. Twenty- that's not in-game, right? Okay, it's not. No, it is.
[5451.77s -> 5460.06s]  All right, now back to the abandoned mine, and I need some old parts.
[5461.35s -> 5470.52s]  Jerma, you suck. Wait, is that- is this Emily? I got so much mail! What?
[5486.07s -> 5496.01s]  Okay, I guess I can do it. I think I had- I think there was like mint on my finger,
[5496.01s -> 5504.09s]  and I just put it in my eye. Yeah, there's like mint on this thing, and how did I get that on my
[5504.09s -> 5511.38s]  hand? My chapstick has mint in it, and I just put it in my eye. All right, this is just fucking spam
[5511.38s -> 5522.07s]  mail. This is just all spam mail. I don't even care. Whatever, I don't care. It's spam mail. So I can
[5522.07s -> 5527.75s]  plant some seeds, right? Teach me how to farm. I need to learn how to farm. Craft the planter box
[5527.75s -> 5535.34s]  and plant the seeds. That's it. Okay, thanks for the help. Just do it. Just plant. Okay. Craft the
[5535.34s -> 5555.50s]  planter box. Where the hell is that? Oh, right here. No, no, no, no, no. Give it to me. Okay.
[5559.11s -> 5567.64s]  Learn how to make a planter box. So how do I do that? Small planter box. Soil? I need to- okay,
[5567.64s -> 5575.14s]  I've got all- I have enough. Okay, I'm gonna make like a few of these. So I do need the shit.
[5583.35s -> 5603.75s]  Wooden board, soil, and animal feces. How do I make a wooden board? Wood? To make hard wood. How do I
[5603.75s -> 5614.38s]  make a wooden board? From civil cutter. Civil cutter? What the fuck is civil cutter?
[5615.02s -> 5624.87s]  I can't just craft it? It's in the handbook. It's the- oh, it's the workbench. Oh, well, I'm kind of
[5624.87s -> 5637.48s]  screwed here. I still don't have any bars. All right, well, I'm going back to the mine. I need to
[5637.48s -> 5649.51s]  get some more stuff anyways. You can cancel it and craft something else. Um, I'll get materials.
[5650.23s -> 5657.59s]  Let's go back into the, uh, into the mine, which the mine is like right over here. It's like right
[5657.59s -> 5672.66s]  next to me. Yeah, we'll go back in here. I already paid for this, right? Yeah, I got it for the week.
[5672.66s -> 5679.59s]  I got it for the week. Put your camera in the top right. What are you doing in here?
[5679.59s -> 5693.61s]  Hello! Oh, yeah, I'm blocking some stuff. You're right. All right, what are you, uh, what are you
[5693.61s -> 5699.74s]  doing down here? It's a huge treasure chest. I hope to get lucky today and find some special relics.
[5701.72s -> 5711.64s]  Wait, people just come in here? This is a tourist here. No, get out of here. This is- I- this is- no,
[5711.64s -> 5722.15s]  I'm not supposed to be here. All right, where was I before? I was over this way, right? I have plenty
[5722.15s -> 5728.94s]  of stamina. Does it remember what I did? No, pick a new spot. I don't want to be away from all these
[5728.94s -> 5751.32s]  people. All right, I'm going this way. Maybe I should go up. I'm gonna go up. Whoa! What is this?
[5751.96s -> 5760.25s]  There's a new- I just found this. All right, this is cool. All right, now over here.
[5765.56s -> 5771.13s]  They're in- all right, there's one over that way. Secret tunnel. Yeah, let's go.
[5776.95s -> 5786.94s]  Your face is blocking some stuff? No, it's not. Not anymore. Termo, you should- I'm not doing any
[5786.94s -> 5804.86s]  of that. All right, what's this? Something good. I hope. What is it? It's a jewel. Just one data- is
[5804.86s -> 5828.82s]  it eyeglass? What a piece of shit. Oh, hold on. We're going this way. I have so much. I need to
[5828.82s -> 5837.24s]  make like 10 of those things. Those smelters. All right, it's a- old parts, data disk, and power
[5837.24s -> 5842.95s]  stone. All right, I got the old parts. I now need to figure out what to get the- the wooden
[5843.43s -> 5849.75s]  planks, whatever it is. I still got time. This is what I'm doing today, so I'm just gonna go
[5850.95s -> 5854.94s]  play Power Stone. I already did, and I beat the game, and it was a fucking breeze.
[5862.15s -> 5868.86s]  Why don't they remake that game? Honest to God. Did- that's one of the coolest IPs that Capcom has.
[5868.86s -> 5876.84s]  Is there a sofa down here? What? This is the couch down here. All right.
[5876.84s -> 5893.66s]  They are? I would love to see a Power Stone remake, or even a remaster.
[5895.51s -> 5904.65s]  New relic, old thermos piece. Cool. Anything else I can do before? Oh, over here.
[5909.29s -> 5911.85s]  I definitely need to make it like three or four of those smelters, at least.
[5915.58s -> 5924.39s]  How much- uh, I got enough. Another data disk. When are we gonna start killing stuff?
[5924.47s -> 5934.06s]  Uh, probably fairly soon, I would imagine. Strange lenses. Oh, I have both eyeglass pieces.
[5934.06s -> 5941.16s]  Can I make glasses? That'd be actually kind of cool. Uh, I'm gonna keep going this way.
[5941.88s -> 5963.93s]  I need more soil. Have I ever seen a UFO? No. Although, sometimes, you know, when you hear a
[5963.93s -> 5970.17s]  plane go over at night, everybody kind of all- everybody's the same thing. You just kind of go,
[5971.19s -> 5986.06s]  oh, it's just a plane. Thank god. It's not aliens. Horse piece. Well, you never hear a plane go over
[5986.06s -> 5990.63s]  and it sounds different or a little closer than normal, or a helicopter or something,
[5990.63s -> 5998.90s]  and you just sit there and you go, what was that? Holy sh- okay, never mind. Come on. More parts.
[5998.90s -> 6018.68s]  All right, I think I gotta get out of here now. I'll go up. Don't ever dig straight up, but whatever.
[6018.68s -> 6023.14s]  It's a different game. There's no lava.
[6030.50s -> 6040.25s]  Uh, monument model piece two. That means there's a monument model piece one.
[6041.67s -> 6047.08s]  All right, this is the last one and I'm done. I promise. I still have- I have a lot of stamina.
[6047.08s -> 6069.21s]  I'm fine. Ooh, copper. And a small engine. This- it's right here. I gotta get my money's worth.
[6069.21s -> 6082.07s]  I paid 80 dollars to come in here. Good. Any more? This, a few more. I can get them.
[6083.98s -> 6106.76s]  You paid 80- oh no, I didn't- the game wasn't 80 dollars. Ooh, horse piece. Do I have the whole
[6106.76s -> 6133.46s]  horse? I'm still okay on stamina. Weird glass jar. 31. All right, 10 more swings and I'm out of here.
[6134.26s -> 6144.15s]  What's that? This is- this is a secret one over here. All right, I don't care. I'm getting it.
[6144.15s -> 6156.82s]  I don't care if I die down here. It's a purple. I need to go down here.
[6159.05s -> 6172.79s]  Fif- come on, 15. What the fuck? What is this? I only have seven more swings. What is down here?
[6175.30s -> 6197.38s]  Shit. Do I- can I drink anything? Abandoned room? What? I have four stamina. Can I eat anything?
[6204.34s -> 6222.47s]  Oh, come on. This just got way cooler. Fuck. I have four stamina. I'm gonna die. I gotta leave.
[6222.47s -> 6243.80s]  How do I get out? Quickly. Eat the sand? I can't eat sand, guys. Will this stay here? I gotta get
[6243.80s -> 6252.06s]  out. Okay, open the map then press- okay, I gotta get out of here. I gotta mark what this is. It's
[6252.06s -> 6263.74s]  right here. Okay, get out. You can't eat sand. I have one stamina point. Shit, I wanna go down
[6263.74s -> 6279.35s]  there. That was cool. That was so cool. All right, I gotta go to bed. Where am I right now? All
[6279.35s -> 6297.48s]  right, so just bang a right and go straight. That was cool. What's going on? Happy? Can I, like,
[6297.48s -> 6306.09s]  drink something? Happy apartments? No, I don't care. I gotta get out of here. I have to get out
[6306.09s -> 6335.10s]  of here. There's a chest right there. All right. All right, get me out. Get me out of the town.
[6335.10s -> 6342.06s]  I have one stamina point left. Get me out of here. There it is. All right, go. Go, go, go, go, go,
[6342.06s -> 6348.55s]  go, go. Back home. Sleep. I don't think you lose stamina unless you do anything. So, I'm just- you
[6348.55s -> 6362.44s]  don't just lose it over time. That's good. Okay, I'm going back down there. This game's pretty sick.
[6362.44s -> 6373.02s]  All right, I'm going back down. Let me store some of this shit. Oh, I have the new sofa. That's
[6373.02s -> 6403.83s]  right. Let me put the sofa down. Sofa? It is a sofa. It's kind of beat up though. Cool. Oh, I
[6403.83s -> 6419.88s]  could invite my friends over. We could hang out on the sofa. This house sucks. Let's get in there.
[6419.88s -> 6425.08s]  What? Imagine the smell. What? Imagine the smell. There's not even a trash can in this house.
[6425.08s -> 6432.66s]  That doesn't work here. Imagine the smell. You understand that? That makes no sense.
[6432.66s -> 6439.48s]  There's just wood and a sofa on the ground. Okay, so now I need the wooden planks.
[6440.12s -> 6455.00s]  Oh shit. So, I'm assuming the bottom will show you what you can do with it. Should I hold on to some
[6455.00s -> 6468.52s]  of this stuff? I think I should, right? I need another one of these. Okay, I need another
[6468.52s -> 6477.67s]  storage unit. Wooden basket. No, where is it? Wooden storage. I'm gonna make a couple of these.
[6485.45s -> 6494.44s]  All right, I'm gonna have one of them be for raw materials, right? One of them for junk and
[6494.44s -> 6502.71s]  other one for like relics. I get it. I'm starting to get this game. Okay, let me pull up this stuff.
[6505.43s -> 6509.27s]  Okay, this is gonna... Okay, then one of the right is gonna be for raw, but just materials.
[6510.22s -> 6520.84s]  Copper, stone, you know, grinding stones, soil, stone. Yeah, whatever, right? Poop. And then the
[6520.84s -> 6531.93s]  second one's gonna be for relics. Yeah, I think so. Okay, so this is gonna be just stuff that I find
[6531.93s -> 6542.68s]  in the dungeon. Okay, bring them to the research facility. I will eventually... I want to go back
[6542.68s -> 6565.35s]  down there. And this is gonna be for planting an organic material. Okay, good. Sort. Hey, there we
[6565.35s -> 6573.88s]  go. I don't even really need this, but I'm just gonna put it away. All right, so now I need to
[6573.88s -> 6583.29s]  build some stuff. No, I'm going back. I'm going back into that thing. Yep, let's go.
[6586.31s -> 6598.06s]  Minecraft Andy. Oh, wait, I can make a sword. That's a good idea. That's right. That's true.
[6603.24s -> 6609.82s]  What does it take to make a sword? I think it's three copper bars. Practice sword? Spiked practice
[6609.82s -> 6620.79s]  sword? No. Bronze pickaxe? How do I make a copper sword? Upgrade the work table at A&G construction.
[6621.43s -> 6634.79s]  Okay, so I have to go upgrade the table at A&G construction. All right, I can do that, too.
[6640.44s -> 6647.91s]  Bring food this time, too. I'm just one track mind Andy. I'm going in. I don't need to. No,
[6647.91s -> 6654.41s]  yeah, I'm just going in. Fuck it. I'm one track Andy. I already bought this place for a week.
[6661.30s -> 6668.57s]  You have skill points? You're gonna die to the slugs. I'm not gonna die to the slugs. I'm gonna
[6668.57s -> 6694.90s]  dodge roll. Okay, so that's where I want to go. Who dug this? Where's, where is it? Where's my um,
[6700.34s -> 6716.89s]  there it is. Okay, so what is in this? What's down here? Oh, I dug like a real weirdo.
[6717.78s -> 6756.36s]  Weird. What did I do? Why did I do it like this? This is the wrong hole. Is it? It's up? What did
[6756.36s -> 6768.18s]  I, where was this? I'm, it's marked on the map. How come I can't see with the radar? Yeah, it was
[6768.18s -> 6785.62s]  the purple one, but it's not on the map anymore. You were going the right way. No, yeah, okay,
[6785.62s -> 6798.81s]  let's sit here. All right, here we go. Let's do it. So should I fight this stuff? All right, what's
[6798.81s -> 6821.83s]  dodge? L1. What's on me? Is it poison? I don't know what that is. How come there's no sound effects?
[6821.83s -> 6851.59s]  All right, we're good. Wait, I could take this, all this furniture? Ow! Is this, I'm at range,
[6851.59s -> 6859.11s]  right? It can't hit me. I'm getting a ton of experience. Wait, wait, wait, wait, I gotta
[6859.11s -> 6873.96s]  level up. I have to level up. Should I have more points in gathering or fighting? What should I do?
[6873.96s -> 6885.94s]  More experience? That's a good one, I think. Yeah, 10% more EXP gained. And okay, I got a lot of this
[6885.94s -> 6903.08s]  other stuff. Just stay at range and I'll be fine. Please put the gloves on. I stored the gloves.
[6903.08s -> 6912.33s]  This is Cheshire Trest over here. Cheshire Trest, there it is. Silver. What about all this stuff?
[6912.33s -> 6947.19s]  Can I pick, can I take any of this? What is this? Cool, two discs. Uh-oh, small silicon chip. That
[6947.19s -> 6954.52s]  was what was in here. This is cool though. You just find random little dungeons. I do the sound effects.
[6956.62s -> 6962.09s]  I think that's all it's in here. Is there anything else I can do? This is cool though.
[6965.96s -> 6985.19s]  Stop blinking out of existence. Dude, you just gotta stop doing those bong hits. The dungeons
[6985.19s -> 6992.41s]  get bigger. I feel like this game's really fun. I would imagine it's probably really fun. That's
[6992.41s -> 6998.25s]  cool. There's just random dungeons you can find. So now that I've done this already, should I just
[6998.25s -> 7011.67s]  kind of move on from it? I mean, I'm already here. Might as well keep looking. Why are you crying?
[7011.91s -> 7024.33s]  Because! There are two in this cave? Interesting. For those of you that are trickling in, yeah,
[7024.33s -> 7033.78s]  I might have COVID. It's a very high possibility. But I'm still feeling fine. I'm still not feeling
[7033.78s -> 7038.76s]  okay to stream. So that's why I'm here and I just wanted to play something chill and easy.
[7039.56s -> 7053.69s]  Just hang out. Okay, let's take a little look. I don't see anything else over here. I'm just
[7054.09s -> 7061.51s]  going to keep going this way. Should I just pick a direction and just go?
[7070.25s -> 7073.45s]  There's no way the base... No, the baseball stream has moved a month. Don't worry.
[7074.01s -> 7086.70s]  You should go down. Okay. Whoa, this is a new floor. I can't break this. Can I? Am I doing...
[7086.70s -> 7095.88s]  Am I damaging this? Dude, I'm just getting experience for hitting this. Look at how much
[7095.88s -> 7103.78s]  experience points I'm getting for this. I'm getting 150 EXP a swing. Oh, it's like that with
[7103.78s -> 7123.11s]  everything. Never mind. I was already at that one. I'll get this one. Is this not the sofa? No.
[7125.78s -> 7147.27s]  Rusty pipe. I need a better pickaxe. How many... Can I just sell these? I don't want four pink
[7147.27s -> 7168.49s]  couches. Let's go up here. It's similar to... This is kind of like an Animal Crossing and
[7168.49s -> 7173.53s]  Stardew Valley combined. That's what it feels like. I feel like there's a lot to do so far.
[7174.49s -> 7186.86s]  It's cute. I like it. What's that? A small clock. I haven't even done any of the farming yet.
[7188.68s -> 7197.40s]  Oh, horse piece. I think I have the whole horse. Can I combine it?
[7198.36s -> 7205.64s]  I'm gonna bring this up to the research center. All right. They ain't nothing. That's it. Wait.
[7205.64s -> 7210.63s]  Yes, there is. All right. I'll get two more things and I'm gonna go up.
[7213.75s -> 7223.70s]  It is a good game. Yeah, it feels like it's fun.
[7224.42s -> 7234.55s]  But I'll tell you, we're gonna have... It's gonna be an intense stream on Tuesday. I thought it was an old
[7234.55s -> 7243.27s]  turkey. I'm gonna be playing multi-versus and you bet your ass that I'm ready to play that one.
[7245.93s -> 7252.01s]  Also, that's gonna be sponsored too, so that's fucking awesome. I'm so ready to play that game.
[7252.73s -> 7260.42s]  There's gonna be a perfect world there. I've been waiting for that to come back out.
[7260.66s -> 7267.78s]  So, you better be ready. Tuesday is gonna be a gamer session. It's gonna be a true gaming session.
[7269.70s -> 7272.58s]  And you know what? I'll be honest. I feel like I was pretty good at that game. I feel like I was
[7272.58s -> 7276.02s]  doing pretty well. I think I only lost like two, three rounds. I think I did really well.
[7276.58s -> 7294.65s]  I think that's my game. I was doing good. I really was. Genuinely. I wonder if there...
[7294.65s -> 7297.53s]  Is there any new characters? I wonder if they're gonna announce any characters or anything.
[7298.25s -> 7332.58s]  I don't know. I don't want another couch. I've got five couches. Yeah, that game does something
[7332.58s -> 7338.52s]  that I'm so happy that they're doing. And like, if you need me to pull up a resource for this,
[7338.52s -> 7344.86s]  I will. I talked about it before, and I'm gonna talk about it again right now before we play it
[7344.86s -> 7353.64s]  again. Fighting games like that, that have tons of moves and combos and shit on the screen. The new
[7353.64s -> 7361.11s]  Smash Brothers games, the last two new Smash Brothers games, it's just every single swing
[7361.11s -> 7366.63s]  is this explosion of smoke and particle effects. And it's like hard to even see what the fuck's
[7366.63s -> 7372.44s]  going on. Every time I've tried to play Smash Brothers, it's just like I'll do like a punch
[7372.44s -> 7379.50s]  to somebody. And it's just this purple fucking smoke explosion. And it's just annoying to look
[7379.58s -> 7388.58s]  at. It's hard to even see. I don't mind particle effects, but man, the new Smash Brothers game
[7388.58s -> 7399.88s]  dialed it up to a million. Those are boomer words. No, they really aren't. I don't think they really
[7399.88s -> 7419.72s]  are. Does anybody agree with me on this? I feel like a lot of you do. There's a lot of visual
[7419.72s -> 7425.08s]  information. It's just too much. Does every single move in Smash Brothers have to create big, huge,
[7425.08s -> 7431.32s]  explosive purple smoke? That's my question. Every single move, does every move have to have big,
[7431.32s -> 7443.40s]  purple, explosive smoke? Every single move in the game. I'm about to fucking educate a lot of people
[7443.40s -> 7477.82s]  here. Let's take a look. I want to go over this because this is important. Is it just like a
[7478.70s -> 7485.13s]  match with no game, no commentary? Not no gameplay, no commentary. Hold on. Smash Brothers,
[7485.21s -> 7490.17s]  I'm looking at YouTube. Smash Brothers, no gameplay, no commentary. So what the fuck are
[7490.17s -> 7503.05s]  you talking about? It would just be the menu? No gameplay. I gotta find one. All right, here we go.
[7506.39s -> 7513.93s]  This is Ultimate, right? We're gonna go over this because I can be a fucking boomer with this. That's
[7513.93s -> 7534.28s]  fine. But it makes it hard to play the game for me. It just kind of annoys me. Make sure it's at HD.
[7534.28s -> 7543.91s]  All right, so let's go frame by frame here. This is just a random YouTube video of Smash Brothers
[7543.91s -> 7558.79s]  Ultimate gameplay. Okay, so let's take a look. Look, okay, somebody just swung and look, look
[7558.79s -> 7569.27s]  what's going on over here. Do you see that? Like, why does this have to happen every time somebody
[7569.27s -> 7582.25s]  gets hit? Look at that. Everybody has to have like all the smoke flying across them. How do I do,
[7582.25s -> 7589.08s]  how do we do each frame? Frame by frame. It's, what is it, forward? Is it, what is it, like K
[7589.08s -> 7602.20s]  or something? How do I do a frame? Comma and period. That didn't work. Why is that not working
[7602.20s -> 7617.45s]  either? Hold on. Ready? It's just, it's too, it's too much. And they started doing this and it's
[7617.45s -> 7624.87s]  for the one for the Wii U. Every move has to have like explosive smoke and like just particle effects
[7624.87s -> 7633.06s]  to take up the both of the whole, both two characters. Listen, somebody gets just punched
[7633.06s -> 7646.90s]  once. It's so much visual data. And I understand like some of it needs to exist, but if you compare
[7646.90s -> 7652.84s]  it, let me compare that to multiverses. There's not this much. Change the playback speed.
[7661.45s -> 7669.29s]  All right. Do you see the smoke? True, true, true. Some, a lot of you disagree with me.
[7669.85s -> 7677.34s]  I know a lot of you don't agree with this, but like this right here, I don't even know who did
[7677.34s -> 7684.36s]  a move to somebody. Like all these like boom, boom, boom, flare, flare, flare, flare. And then all
[7684.36s -> 7692.28s]  this other shit like the blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, sway, sway, sway, sway, swing. Old man
[7692.28s -> 7708.76s]  yelling at clouds. Like what happened here? It's okay. Whatever. That's okay. Do a poll.
[7709.48s -> 7715.42s]  No, I think a lot of people are going to disagree with me because they like Nintendo,
[7715.42s -> 7720.14s]  right? Like I have to automatically be wrong by with a lot of people because it's a Nintendo
[7720.14s -> 7741.74s]  game. Like I don't even know who did a move. Hey, by the way, I love the Smash Brothers franchise.
[7741.74s -> 7763.74s]  Do you like bright colors and smoke? Do you like bright colors and smoke? I'm actually very,
[7763.74s -> 7770.65s]  please say honestly, speak honestly. Don't just, a streamer just told you something. Don't do it.
[7771.13s -> 7775.32s]  I want to know what you really feel. How do you really feel about that? How do you feel about
[7775.32s -> 7795.06s]  that? How do you truly feel about that? It's messy. I think it is. What's the I don't care
[7795.06s -> 7801.98s]  option? Yeah, you can do the I don't. Wait, what? Oh, I gotta leave. You need effects for info. Yeah,
[7801.98s -> 7806.70s]  you need effects for info, but they, it's just they ever since they, I don't know what game it
[7806.70s -> 7812.78s]  was. It was maybe brawl or after brawl. I don't remember it being that crazy where you would do
[7812.78s -> 7822.06s]  a move and like the whole screen would flash with like five different colors. I actually have to
[7822.06s -> 7834.36s]  get at her. You're just older. No, I'm definitely not. What do they, what do they say? You can't
[7834.36s -> 7840.14s]  turn them off. No. What's the consensus on this? I want to see how out of touch I am with with
[7840.14s -> 7857.13s]  reality here. The new Mario Kart games have this problem too. What happened? I fell over. Oh,
[7857.13s -> 7867.90s]  all right, whatever. 60. All right. So that's not, I don't think that's unanimous though.
[7874.92s -> 7880.12s]  That's kind of a majority. That's a majority, but not by very much. That's a kind of,
[7880.76s -> 7893.14s]  do I lose money from falling asleep? Hardly. Important announcement tonight. Oh, okay.
[7893.14s -> 7906.28s]  19 o'clock. I'll be there. 57 is pretty big. And again, don't get me wrong. I played,
[7907.90s -> 7911.74s]  all right, old parts. I played the new Smash game and I thought it was good. I just
[7913.08s -> 7918.20s]  just can't get over it. I can't get over this. This new, maybe I am an old guy, but I'll tell you
[7919.00s -> 7925.48s]  this new wave of, there has to be seven different colors exploding on the screen whenever you do
[7925.48s -> 7931.18s]  anything. This is a new thing in the last like five, 10 years. Call me an old fuck. Go for it.
[7933.66s -> 7948.73s]  Go ahead. Tell me. God, I'm an old man. That's fine. All right. I got it. So I have a grinder now.
[7949.37s -> 7959.85s]  Where should I put it? But the, okay, the whole, the people are going, wow, what's,
[7959.85s -> 7963.37s]  who is he talking to? Who is he talking to? The whole reason why I went off on that
[7964.33s -> 7971.59s]  is because multiverses does not have all that crazy shit all over the screen every time you
[7971.59s -> 7975.83s]  do anything. It's there, but it's not there to an extreme extent like it is in the new Smash game.
[7976.47s -> 7980.55s]  And that's why I was like, well, I actually kind of want to play this. Yeah. Is it petty and weird?
[7980.55s -> 7984.31s]  Sure. But that's why I like the game a little more. I'm just telling you the way that I feel.
[7984.95s -> 7995.90s]  You can think I'm a weirdo. That's fine. That's fine. You can call me weird. Who is he talking
[7995.90s -> 8003.11s]  to? See? Somebody said it. Jeremy, the sponsor isn't today. I'm just, I said this a month ago
[8003.11s -> 8015.67s]  when I played it. All right. So now I have the grinder. Now I can do, okay, here we go.
[8016.31s -> 8029.98s]  Copper blades. Any power here? All right. I need to make three copper blades. So I need some more
[8029.98s -> 8051.64s]  of these. Okay. Or bar. Let's refuel. Okay. Old fuck Andy. All right. Let me go to the research
[8051.64s -> 8058.78s]  center. I have a lot of stuff that I could probably bring over there. They're going to
[8058.78s -> 8065.83s]  add that shit after release. No, they're not. Why would they? I've probably pissed off a lot
[8065.83s -> 8069.59s]  of people, but what do you want me to say? I can't like pretend like I can, I can get over it.
[8070.31s -> 8087.11s]  All right. Let me put the sofas in the house. They're going to add effects. Can you imagine
[8087.11s -> 8091.96s]  they just added a bunch of effects after the release of the game? That'd be so stupid.
[8098.38s -> 8106.98s]  These two I have. I think I'm selling these. I don't think I'm, I, you know what I mean? I'm
[8108.54s -> 8119.86s]  whatever. I'm getting out of here. You're barely barely into your thirties, but you have takes
[8119.86s -> 8129.67s]  from a 60 year old. What? That's come on. Okay. So now I need to make what I need to like a sword,
[8129.67s -> 8141.74s]  right? Uh, okay. I gotta go to A and G construction and the research place. Let me pull out all the
[8141.74s -> 8158.90s]  things that I can bring to the research center. No. Okay. Here we go. Bring all the relics. Okay.
[8160.41s -> 8163.61s]  All right. I got a shitload of relics. Let's go. Go to the research center.
[8164.17s -> 8188.58s]  Is the research center in town here? There it is. Okay. Research center. We'll get bad booger
[8188.58s -> 8196.22s]  noises. I'm all right. Dermot hates colors because you only remember when things are black and white.
[8197.32s -> 8201.16s]  No, I know. There's a bunch of people right now that are watching the stream and they are going,
[8202.60s -> 8214.34s]  I get you, man. I get it. Hey, me, me and my boys said the same thing. Who do I turn this into?
[8214.90s -> 8235.10s]  Uh, oh, it's up here. No, this is not a zoomer versus boomer thing. Hey, discovered something
[8235.10s -> 8239.74s]  new. I got a lot of shit for you to look at these strange lenses in the ruins. Do you know what they
[8239.74s -> 8248.66s]  are? Oh, this is pretty neat. They're glasses with a colorful tint. These aren't regular lenses though.
[8248.66s -> 8255.94s]  That's for sure. Hey, director, come check this out. What do we have here? Interesting. I'm going
[8255.94s -> 8262.30s]  to take a look. You can come back tomorrow. I have a lot of other stuff. Hold on. I'm just going to
[8262.30s -> 8280.79s]  go to the fucking register training dummy weapon rack. Ooh, chipset. Wait, can I, uh, wait, recover?
[8282.38s -> 8289.54s]  Oh shit. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I need one. I need an old thermos piece too.
[8291.86s -> 8302.84s]  I'm still missing galloping horse pieces. Come on. Really? I don't, I can't make any of these stupid
[8302.84s -> 8314.52s]  things. A million, not in a million. I'm only 500 followers away from a million followers.
[8319.51s -> 8330.54s]  Is it going to happen? Is it going to happen today? 500 followers away. Oh my God. Only 500
[8330.54s -> 8346.79s]  followers away to a million. That's crazy though. Actually crazy. I'm Chiwa, the smallest of the
[8346.79s -> 8353.53s]  Hulu brothers. There's seven of us. So, uh, how many people unfollowed me from the Nintendo rant
[8353.53s -> 8362.92s]  though? Uh, we said we still on pace for today. Fishing rod. You're the new builder, right? I'm
[8362.92s -> 8367.80s]  Chiwa. I live to fish, but a big one broke my fishing rod yesterday. All right, you want a new
[8367.80s -> 8378.63s]  fishing rod? It's going to happen. Just, okay, it's like boiling water. I don't want to look at it or
[8378.63s -> 8387.00s]  it won't happen. Flower shop. What was I? Okay, I need to build a bridge, make copper blades, and
[8387.00s -> 8404.02s]  wait a day. Let me do the blades part. Yeah, let me do the blades. I can turn that in. Bake a cake
[8404.02s -> 8410.38s]  to celebrate. Do a baking a cake stream. Do I bake a cake for a million? That's kind of no.
[8419.22s -> 8438.14s]  Refresh, it's there. I don't see it. Okay, copper blades. I need copper bars. Um, I need to make
[8438.14s -> 8447.03s]  another one of these. I need to make like two more of those. Furnace. Okay, I want to make a stone
[8447.03s -> 8453.10s]  furnace. I need ten wood. I have to get into my inventory. Right, all right, all right, all right.
[8453.90s -> 8467.42s]  Move all this crap out of the way. Okay, I need the wood. I'm out of wood. I gotta go
[8467.42s -> 8477.77s]  get some trees cut down. Stone stool, wood. I only have eight. All right, I need a stone stool.
[8481.90s -> 8488.71s]  I need three, two more stone stools. I can make 28 of these. I'll make three. I'll make four. Yeah,
[8489.27s -> 8500.38s]  okay. Stone stool. Did I do it? No, I didn't. I'm not, did I do it? That's not there.
[8500.94s -> 8526.49s]  Is it actually there? Refresh. No, it's 9956. It's not there yet. I will say that's actually
[8526.49s -> 8537.46s]  kind of a big deal though because I'll explain why. If I hit it today, I need,
[8538.26s -> 8565.05s]  I just gotta go cut trees down. I'll give a speech. Don't worry. You'll get a big speech. I promise.
[8565.05s -> 8594.65s]  Close enough. No, it's got, I have to actually hit it. All right, wood.
[8594.65s -> 8609.32s]  No, come on, come on, come on, come on. I'm keeping an eye on it. Don't worry. Stone stool.
[8610.36s -> 8631.14s]  And what's the last part? All right, done. Pick that up. Again, make another one. Pick it up.
[8631.78s -> 8639.37s]  Do it again. Because I'm not going to wait the whole day to, I want to be able to grind this out,
[8639.37s -> 8653.94s]  right? All right, now I'm placing, I gotta, I gotta move some of this shit around. This is not a bad
[8653.94s -> 8662.95s]  spot. Let me move this. This can go, the grinder can go right over here and then these are going
[8662.95s -> 8689.34s]  to go over here. I've got three more of these. One, two, three. One, two, three. Okay, I've got
[8689.34s -> 8699.83s]  my line now. So now I've got to, I need a bunch more wood. Just keep getting wood. This is a
[8699.83s -> 8723.14s]  grind day. Is this technically a tree? Fibers. Okay, fiber is good. Give more points. Vape on
[8723.14s -> 8729.86s]  stream for a million. No, I could probably kill the, yeah, let's kill some of these things.
[8730.74s -> 8747.58s]  I was afraid of them before. Let's see if I can kill them. I kind of feel bad. I got animal bones
[8747.58s -> 8761.29s]  and worn fur. I kind of feel bad. All right, I got a, how many copper, how many copper do I have?
[8761.93s -> 8765.78s]  I need a little bit more wood because I'm gonna let, I'm gonna make like 50 iron
[8765.78s -> 8786.02s]  copper bars overnight. But I want, I want 100 copper bars. Oh, I missed the like important
[8786.02s -> 8798.78s]  meeting, right? No, it's going on right now, isn't it? Come on, come on, come on. I'm there,
[8798.78s -> 8805.16s]  I'm here, I'm here. I'm 30 minutes late to this meeting. Come on. Yes, I made it.
[8824.07s -> 8830.63s]  I don't know what a pan bad infestation is like. Sometimes I wish we had a tank. In other news,
[8831.19s -> 8836.47s]  we've decided to proceed with the building of a bridge to Amber Island. A builder has already
[8836.47s -> 8842.95s]  been picked for this project. Also, we are in preparations for the construction of the DD
[8842.95s -> 8848.15s]  transportation system. We're securing the funding over the coming weeks and pick a builder soon.
[8849.11s -> 8853.03s]  DD. DD. DD.
[8858.15s -> 8872.58s]  I thought people liked cartoons in this chat. What happened? Where did you guys come from?
[8873.14s -> 8879.00s]  I thought you guys liked cartoons. Aren't you guys cartoon enjoyers?
[8879.64s -> 8899.32s]  Please stop doing the Kubrick stare. DD. That's from Dexter's lab. What? In Dexter's lab.
[8900.28s -> 8911.06s]  I thought you guys liked cartoons. Now I finally get to fish there. He's asking for money again.
[8911.78s -> 8916.50s]  Finally, we have a new builder in town this week who lives in the old workshop
[8916.50s -> 8920.42s]  outside the city gate. What are you doing? Let's all give a warm welcome.
[8923.91s -> 8927.99s]  By the way, we're all being very, very nice and cordial to him because he's holding an axe at the
[8927.99s -> 8948.17s]  meeting. You should get to know some of the people. Yeah, everyone be nice. He's got an axe in his
[8948.25s -> 8953.54s]  hand and he has an I'll kill you mustache. What's his name again? Jerry. There he is.
[8963.93s -> 8968.46s]  All right. I got to make one more copper blade, but I do have to meet people.
[8969.02s -> 8976.76s]  I don't want to meet everybody. You just inherited that workshop outside of town, right?
[8983.78s -> 9001.24s]  Okay. Nice to meet you. Oh, hi. A new builder. Nice to see young folks moving in. If you need
[9001.24s -> 9006.49s]  refreshments, I'm your man. Okay. Plus 10 relationship status.
[9016.10s -> 9025.45s]  Move out of the way. Move out of the way. Get out of the way. Yeah. Don't care. Move.
[9037.48s -> 9067.24s]  How much I get? I get 67 bucks. Come on. Hello. Oh, what? Oh, did I actually have to time it?
[9067.96s -> 9100.20s]  Do I actually have to time it? Plus I'm doing $50. That's worth something. It was 50 gold. It's not
[9100.20s -> 9107.10s]  like it was 5000. I'm about to make all that money with all my fucking copper by Emporium.
[9107.74s -> 9117.91s]  Just wait. Do I have to meet all these people? No, I don't. I don't care. I'm waiting today.
[9117.91s -> 9124.07s]  I'm making the copper blades and making my copper shit. I have a lot of copper.
[9124.71s -> 9135.91s]  Get away from my house. Get away from my house. Where are you? I'm Gus. I'd love to stop and chat
[9136.39s -> 9202.17s]  cake and all that like stump. I can't. We're gonna get timed out here. He took a dollar from me.
[9202.17s -> 9218.86s]  Okay, whatever. I don't care. I do need to do this though. So this has got this is going anywhere.
[9218.86s -> 9228.49s]  Where's my copper? I have a shitload of copper somewhere. Where is it? Where is it? Don't I have
[9228.49s -> 9237.37s]  a bunch of copper? I thought I had like 100. There we go. Alright, so this one we're gonna get going.
[9238.54s -> 9261.42s]  Refuel that up. Get that moving. Get this one moving. Okay, get this one going. Alright,
[9261.42s -> 9267.75s]  I'm out of copper. Oh, it's that's all right. Sorry. I got three going. Not a million. Stop
[9267.75s -> 9298.36s]  saying it. Can I actually sell these though? Where did I get this? I can sell these for $50 each.
[9298.36s -> 9320.10s]  Give me all of them. I don't want any of these. I don't want any of these. I'll keep one. Sell
[9320.10s -> 9326.12s]  the bed. I'm not telling the bed. I'm not going to sleep on that just random pink sofa. Okay,
[9326.12s -> 9338.60s]  talk with Merlin. Make another copper blade. There we go. Look at this fucking delicious
[9338.60s -> 9352.34s]  Hershey's chocolate bar. Okay, now I gotta make a copper blade. Okay, I still have fuel.
[9354.31s -> 9370.12s]  Just make one more. Turn this in. Come on, hurry up. I need to make some new weapons. Enhanced
[9370.12s -> 9379.77s]  practice sword. I mean, I feel like I should just I could probably I could make one of these.
[9381.14s -> 9386.47s]  Wooden hardwood. I think that's easy, right? Hershey's is disgusting. I mean, it's okay.
[9399.86s -> 9417.43s]  Cadbury's better. I mean, that's that's obvious. Yeah, you know, the old Wonka bars were the best
[9418.82s -> 9430.18s]  before they went out of business. Okay, so now I'm gonna go talk to that guy. I don't care.
[9434.97s -> 9451.10s]  Five wooden boards. Yeah, sure. Alright, where's this guy? We're gonna go here. Maybe I'll make
[9451.10s -> 9464.98s]  some money. I'm gonna sell these couches too. What happened to Wonka? They went out of business.
[9464.98s -> 9471.38s]  They sold off all their IP. The only thing that still exists from Wonka is nerds. Whoever they
[9471.38s -> 9476.58s]  whatever company bought them, whoever owns nerds. Purchased the company, liquidated everything and
[9476.58s -> 9492.12s]  then kept nerds around. Okay. What'd I get? All right, that's a hundred.
[9492.28s -> 9497.50s]  That's 200 bucks. I just made 200 plus dollars. That's perfect. All right, cool.
[9498.14s -> 9509.48s]  Talk with Merlin. Where's Merlin? What is this for? Oh, right. Where's Merlin? At the research
[9509.48s -> 9541.14s]  center, right? Oh, cool. Two points. Harvesting activities. Hmm. Or dodge rolls are better.
[9541.78s -> 9550.81s]  I think I'm going to experience. Okay. I've got a lot of random shit going on here.
[9550.81s -> 9558.44s]  Okay, let's go. Go turn 200 into 10k. I'm not going to go slot machine.
[9558.60s -> 9576.17s]  No. Okay, let's go turn this in. I'll talk to you guys after I get out. Gambling now. No.
[9576.73s -> 9583.56s]  I took a look at the lenses you brought. I thought they were guidance lenses or focus
[9583.56s -> 9590.68s]  lenses used in an ancient AI. Ancient AI? They're just eyeglasses. Wonka was just Nestle, man. You
[9590.68s -> 9601.00s]  were duped. But the Wonka bars were good. Different how? These glasses alter the spectrum of light
[9601.08s -> 9606.04s]  passing through. I think they were used to fix color blinds. Original Wonka chocolate bars.
[9607.08s -> 9617.32s]  They were delicious. Okay. It's not something we can easily make today. That's for sure.
[9617.32s -> 9622.04s]  Well, they're useless to me, so you can have them back. What's a good donut? I haven't had a good
[9622.04s -> 9628.52s]  donut in a long time. You can take the glasses to him. What's a good donut? What's your guys'
[9628.52s -> 9637.72s]  favorite donut? Chocolate glazed. Dunkin' Donuts used to do this thing, and I think they still do,
[9637.72s -> 9644.52s]  but I haven't had one in a long time. They used to do the cream-filled ones. I was such a disgusting
[9644.52s -> 9651.50s]  kid. There was a chocolate cream. It wasn't frosting, though. It was a mousse, almost.
[9652.22s -> 9657.66s]  It was a Dunkin' Donuts chocolate cream-filled donut, and it was this weird in-between of frosting
[9657.66s -> 9663.02s]  and mousse. I think they still have them, but holy shit. No, not a Boston cream. I'm not a big fan
[9663.02s -> 9668.46s]  of those. Chocolate cream-filled. And I used to, seriously, I would just take it and put my mouth
[9668.46s -> 9673.50s]  on the end where the hole was, because it was like a little dollop was on the end. It was a donut,
[9673.50s -> 9679.26s]  fat kind of squishy donut, and inside was a bunch of chocolate cream. And I used to sit there and
[9679.26s -> 9687.10s]  just like... I would suck it up, and then I would just bite into the donut where the filling was,
[9687.10s -> 9698.55s]  and just drain it. I was like a vampire to this donut. I also, I was one of those kids that only
[9698.55s -> 9704.39s]  ate the frosting part of the cupcakes. I was like, why would I eat the other part? It was
[9704.39s -> 9712.15s]  fucking worthless to me. Why would I eat that part? Guys, the bottom of the cupcake may as well have
[9712.15s -> 9722.97s]  been made out of wood. It was part of the thing that held the cupcake. Okay, so can I turn this
[9722.97s -> 9733.90s]  stuff in, though? No, I don't have enough. So what did that do for me? Give the glasses to somebody.
[9733.90s -> 9746.47s]  I didn't pay any attention to that. Who do I need to give these glasses to? You wiped the frosting
[9746.47s -> 9751.83s]  off. I was one of those kids that wiped the frosting off. You did? Really? So you like just
[9751.83s -> 9764.17s]  the kind of the cake? The donut? I mean the cupcake cake. Interesting. See, I hated the cake part. I
[9764.17s -> 9783.69s]  still do. Okay, Sanwa. Where's Sanwa? I gotta go here, too. All right, let me go here first.
[9788.09s -> 9796.57s]  Both of you are weird for that. I don't think so. Grown man only eats icing.
[9798.97s -> 9802.57s]  Well, not anymore. I'm talking about when I was like five.
[9809.75s -> 9839.53s]  Ooh, that makes it worse. You should eat icing on stream. That explains your flabby skin. Yeah?
[9840.25s -> 9847.94s]  Where's that again? Excuse me, where's that again? Excuse me, you say I got flabby neck skin?
[9847.94s -> 9852.33s]  Excuse me, what are you talking about? This is the most elastic fucking skin you've ever seen.
[9856.09s -> 9873.80s]  That kind of hurt. All right, what do I have to do? Who's in here? There's nobody in here. You
[9873.80s -> 9902.47s]  wear a rubber mask. Oh, this is where I want to go. Okay, now what is this? Oh, okay. I need wooden
[9902.47s -> 9914.28s]  boards, 2,000 bucks, and old parts and I can make a lot of new shit. I can't do any of this really
[9914.36s -> 9929.54s]  yet. I can upgrade the house. $10,000 and I can get married. Okay, this game's cool. This is cool.
[9931.26s -> 9933.90s]  I can't promise I'm going to play the hell out of this game, but it's definitely a fun
[9934.46s -> 9947.35s]  game to check out. Now I want a donut. I'll make my own donuts.
[9950.22s -> 9953.75s]  Now, I don't know what I was thinking about this the other day, but did I guys ever tell you
[9953.75s -> 9959.27s]  that story when I was cooking bacon with no clothes on and the oil was just... Did I ever
[9959.91s -> 9970.57s]  tell this to you before? Yeah, no, I definitely have. Here we go. Let me get... Here is your
[9971.93s -> 9984.62s]  glasses. Tell it again. I don't... Question marks. All right, so Holly and I were making breakfast
[9985.34s -> 9992.22s]  one time and I was like, let's do a whole spread. We're going to do eggs, bacon,
[9993.10s -> 9997.82s]  sausage, you know, like tomatoes and shit, right? We just, let's do everything.
[9999.00s -> 10004.12s]  And I was in charge of the bacon, right? I'll take care of the bacon. That's what I'll do.
[10004.12s -> 10011.08s]  And now I'm on the stovetop. And I don't know why I was doing this. I have no answer for you.
[10011.80s -> 10017.72s]  I was too lazy to put a shirt on. So I was just shirtless standing there cooking bacon in the pan
[10018.68s -> 10024.36s]  and just the eggs were over here. There was... She was doing something over on the other side.
[10024.36s -> 10026.76s]  Like we were preparing stuff and I was just sitting there cooking the bacon and it was
[10026.76s -> 10036.90s]  just splashing oil, just hitting me in the chest. I just kept on going, oh, oh, oh,
[10037.78s -> 10042.50s]  this is fucking burning me. I was just getting splashed with oil and I didn't even care.
[10043.14s -> 10048.78s]  I didn't even care. I didn't move. It was just kind of hurting me. And Holly's just like,
[10048.78s -> 10053.42s]  what are you doing? What are you doing? And I'm just like, I'm fine. I'm fine. It's not a big deal
[10053.42s -> 10059.82s]  because I just, okay, I got to go put a shirt on now. No, I'm just, whatever. I'm just going to let
[10059.82s -> 10072.55s]  it happen. It didn't hurt that much, right? You're a Sims NPC. I just remember hearing like the pop,
[10072.55s -> 10081.06s]  pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. It was just like, I had these little red dot marks all over my chest.
[10085.78s -> 10090.26s]  But Holly laughs. She's like, I keep remembering. You're just sitting there like shaking it with
[10090.26s -> 10098.15s]  like pajama pants on, like tired. It was early in the morning. Just like, ah, it must've been so
[10098.15s -> 10109.13s]  fucking crazy looking. And this wasn't 10 seconds. This was probably five straight minutes. I had
[10109.13s -> 10119.72s]  been doing it for like at least a few minutes, right? You're a Skyrim NPC. Source engine NPC
[10119.72s -> 10137.34s]  standing in fire. But I didn't care enough. Look, the pain threshold that I had to, all right, so
[10137.34s -> 10143.43s]  put on a shirt so you don't get splashed with bacon oil and it hurts. It didn't cross that
[10143.43s -> 10147.83s]  certain pain threshold. It was just enough where it was like, I don't care. If it was any higher,
[10148.57s -> 10154.84s]  I would have put on, I would have put one on. We have aprons. Yeah, but the apron wouldn't even
[10154.84s -> 10161.06s]  matter. Okay, so here's why the apron doesn't matter. If I had an apron on, aprons are from
[10161.06s -> 10171.75s]  like here down. All this is still skin and flesh, all here. It's still, it was like the neck.
[10174.86s -> 10192.57s]  What kind of apron? Aprons are like overalls. You're wearing it wrong? There's only one way
[10192.57s -> 10199.37s]  an apron goes on and it doesn't cover your arms, bare arms, bare neck and clavicle area.
[10201.51s -> 10212.87s]  I wasn't gonna go put a sweater on. Skill issue. So wear a shirt. But I would have to go get it. I
[10212.87s -> 10226.78s]  didn't want to go get it. That was a lot of experience. 500 bucks too. Holy smokes. Wait,
[10226.78s -> 10240.04s]  you make bread? That's what my place is called. Okay, has he given the speech yet? I haven't hit
[10240.04s -> 10257.05s]  a million followers yet. I'm not gonna go gamble it. Did I have 100 copper ore? This is not doing
[10257.05s -> 10268.46s]  anything for me. Should I go buy some clothes? Oh yeah, let's do it. Okay, work clothes.
[10272.28s -> 10279.43s]  This is too much money. Okay, I did all those missions. I have some money now. Let's go back.
[10280.31s -> 10303.34s]  You have a bread place. Take off the mask. All right, I need to build the bridge. Let's go back
[10303.34s -> 10325.72s]  home and assess what I need to build the bridge. I have to build the bridge. Okay, copper, hard wood
[10326.97s -> 10338.79s]  and copper pipe. I need 20. Where do I get hardwood from? Do I have to make it? I think I
[10338.79s -> 10355.48s]  have to make it. Hardwood. How do I make hardwood? How do I make hardwood? You have to upgrade your
[10355.48s -> 10381.94s]  axe. Do I? I need a civil cutter. Okay. Stone, brick, copper, blade. All right. I have, I can
[10382.58s -> 10391.96s]  look at these chocolates. Let's make some more. Let's make like, I don't know, three copper blades.
[10392.76s -> 10406.57s]  And then what else is this? Stone, brick. How do I make a fucking stone brick? Stone, brick. What the
[10406.57s -> 10441.26s]  fuck? How do I make a stone brick? Tin ore. How do I make a stone brick? It's in the furnace. Stone,
[10441.26s -> 10448.58s]  brick. Ah, there it is. All right, dude. How many do I need? Yeah, I'll make this over here.
[10453.62s -> 10472.25s]  My nose. It's like a bug in my nose. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. Two seconds.
[10602.52s -> 10607.19s]  Hey, one more second. I'm just blowing my nose. I'll be right back. I'm good. Two seconds.
[10710.12s -> 10714.12s]  Oh shit, I forgot to put up the BRB thing. It's all right.
[10719.18s -> 10732.14s]  Shit. Shit. We're fine. Everybody relax. I'm fine. Yeah, I just had to blow my nose really quickly.
[10732.78s -> 10735.34s]  It felt like there were bugs in my nose, but that's not what it was.
[10736.06s -> 10761.11s]  I just had to go blow my nose. It's like heavy. Snorting bugs in the bathroom. It sounds like,
[10761.11s -> 10780.98s]  it's like a rock band title for an album or something. Yeah, and here from their new album,
[10782.10s -> 10800.17s]  Pain, is snorting bugs in the bathroom. Copper blade and stone brick. Did I get it?
[10800.17s -> 10813.30s]  I only made two of these? What are you, out of your mind? I need way more than that. Oh, I need
[10813.30s -> 10835.06s]  wood. I don't have any wood, do I? Gotta go cut down some more trees. Let's go. I feel like I'm
[10835.06s -> 10853.02s]  depleting the forest over here. There's some bugs hanging out of your nose. That's all right. No,
[10853.02s -> 10859.18s]  I need 200 followers. This is crazy. I actually think I'm going to hit it today. It's going to
[10859.18s -> 10863.88s]  happen today. Oh, I got to think of something to say. Actually, I know what to say. I know what
[10863.88s -> 10868.60s]  to say. I've been practicing in the mirror for months. I've been practicing this speech in the
[10868.60s -> 10889.74s]  mirror for three months. I know it. I wrote it down too. I have a whole script. It's about seven
[10889.74s -> 10894.58s]  or eight pages long. It's not going to take long. This is a quick speech talking about the channel
[10894.58s -> 10920.81s]  and everything. It's probably be about 30 to 40 minutes in total length. It's going to be a full
[10920.81s -> 10932.79s]  state of the union. I hope I don't get emotional. I might get emotional. I might start crying.
[10933.51s -> 10946.98s]  I'm going to cry. I've got to be careful here. I want enough wood where I never have to cut a
[10946.98s -> 10972.63s]  tree down again. That's what I want. How much wood? I'm going to cut down every single tree that I
[10972.63s -> 10991.43s]  physically can around my residence. This might not be the game for you, dude. Who is this game for,
[10991.43s -> 11001.16s]  then? It's a game where you run around and chop trees down and do errands and stuff. Who is this
[11002.04s -> 11013.67s]  before, then? It's just a fun, chill game. Dude, this ain't for you. What is for me?
[11016.07s -> 11019.59s]  What do you guys think is a game for me? If you're like, that's a game for you.
[11027.43s -> 11049.40s]  Halo 2, please. Among Us. Kingdom Hearts. Undertale? Undertale was a game for me. You're
[11049.40s -> 11065.27s]  right. That was great. I've cut down every single tree that's out in my backyard, so

[12173.02s -> 12182.85s]  deal to me because my old YouTube channel right just German 985 second
[12182.85s -> 12188.31s]  German Twitter doesn't matter I've never been to a million followers across any
[12188.31s -> 12193.15s]  platform even the old YouTube channel even to German 985 did not have a
[12193.15s -> 12199.00s]  million subscribers once I got to about five or six hundred thousand I stopped
[12199.00s -> 12205.86s]  doing YouTube videos right moved over here the second channel doesn't have a
[12205.86s -> 12213.31s]  million this is the first place where I've ever had a million followers so
[12213.31s -> 12220.74s]  that's really that's crazy I know that there's a lot of other people that have
[12220.74s -> 12225.04s]  way more than a million followers but whatever it's still that's really cool
[12225.04s -> 12233.34s]  the first time I've ever seen it I'm gonna take this moment and I'm gonna
[12233.90s -> 12249.97s]  fall asleep on the ground where's my house but yeah I I've never stuck around
[12249.97s -> 12255.69s]  in a place long enough to make enough videos or streams or whatever to get
[12255.69s -> 12269.70s]  past a million that's that's a lot of people who's this why there's snake
[12269.70s -> 12290.67s]  berries ooh that looks nice did I ever think I was gonna get to a
[12290.67s -> 12303.14s]  million followers I don't know not really but it's been a very very long
[12303.18s -> 12308.94s]  time but I've I switched I was youtuber then I was a streamer and then I did
[12308.94s -> 12314.58s]  YouTube a second channel and I don't really tweet that much I think I have
[12314.58s -> 12321.92s]  like I say only have but when I'm when you're using the million follower kind
[12321.92s -> 12325.84s]  of mark here I have like 300,000 followers that's a lot of followers but
[12325.84s -> 12333.48s]  just not even close so I just kept kind of switching but it means a lot I'm
[12333.48s -> 12340.29s]  happy that people think this channel is cool I hope you continue to do so there's
