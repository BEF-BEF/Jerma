[0.31s -> 15.01s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary,
[15.01s -> 22.27s]  and tonight, playing as the Demoman on Thunder Mountain. I can't do the noise with my mouth,
[22.27s -> 26.35s]  but you understand, on Thunder Mountain right now is the Demoman with a very, very, very
[26.35s -> 30.95s]  weird setup. Before I get really into this commentary at all, I want to talk about the
[31.83s -> 37.47s]  So I'm using the Alibaba's Wii booties, the Sticky Launcher, and the Frying Pan. Now,
[37.47s -> 43.11s]  the reason why I did this, I'm kind of sick of doing the whole regular Demoman setup,
[43.11s -> 48.87s]  because the Demoman doesn't have really any options. He only has two real primaries and
[48.87s -> 54.89s]  two real secondaries. I mean, I don't really even count the shields. I mean, they are weapons,
[54.89s -> 59.03s]  but they're not technically weapons. They just add a mechanic. They add a charge mechanic
[59.03s -> 63.42s]  into the game. So what I'm talking about, I'm talking about real weapons. I really do wish
[63.42s -> 69.72s]  Valve would stop making all these melee unlockables for the Demoman and actually focus on some
[69.72s -> 74.70s]  new primaries and some new secondaries, because we need them, because there's nothing else
[74.70s -> 80.42s]  you can really do. And personally, I really don't like the Scottish Resistance. I think
[80.42s -> 84.98s]  the Scottish Resistance is too weird to use. I can't really get used to it. So somebody
[84.98s -> 89.94s]  like me that doesn't ever use the Scottish Resistance, I just have the default Sticky
[89.94s -> 95.16s]  Launcher and I have a shield I can put on. So what I'm doing right now is I'm doing
[95.16s -> 100.12s]  a weird kind of different setup that not very many people do, and it's the Alibaba's Wii
[100.12s -> 104.92s]  booties, like I said, and the Sticky Launcher, specifically to get the extra health. So I'm
[104.92s -> 109.81s]  really just a sticky bomb tank. It's really what I am. Because I've been looking back
[109.81s -> 115.81s]  at my Demoman videos and even playing as the Demoman, whenever I play as the damn Demoman,
[116.53s -> 121.42s]  I always just use the default stuff. And unless I'm doing a demo night, and I've got to get
[121.42s -> 127.29s]  away from that, this is kind of my way to change it up a little bit and stop using the
[127.29s -> 132.61s]  same damn items over and over and over again. And this is a very odd setup. And it is, even
[132.61s -> 137.58s]  though it is odd, it is a lot of fun and it's actually pretty useful. It's pretty much
[137.58s -> 143.61s]  just putting on the Darwin's Danger Shield for the Sniper. And yes, you do lose your
[144.01s -> 148.29s]  grenade launcher, but honestly, for the most part, most of us use the grenade launcher
[148.29s -> 152.01s]  for spam anyways. And a lot of, some of us are okay though. Some of us can get those
[152.01s -> 156.77s]  great Demoman direct shots. And for that, you guys, I commend you. I give you a clap.
[156.77s -> 160.45s]  I give you applause. Because sometimes it's difficult for me to do that, unless I'm using
[160.45s -> 165.65s]  the lock and load. But it takes the spam factor away from you and makes you really have to
[165.65s -> 171.64s]  focus with your sticky launchers and you get extra health. So until Valve adds some new
[171.64s -> 176.60s]  primaries and secondaries, some new innovative primaries and secondaries for the Demoman,
[176.60s -> 181.34s]  I'll probably be rolling around with this for a little while. So for the next half of
[181.34s -> 184.72s]  the commentary, I want to talk about, I want to get away from the game and the gameplay
[184.72s -> 191.24s]  for a little bit. And I want to discuss exercise, exercising and the gym. Because I remember
[191.24s -> 196.04s]  in my last, my Q&A video, I told you guys that I was getting a little sloppy. I hadn't
[196.04s -> 200.08s]  been to the gym in a long time. It's been like three months and I finally just went
[200.08s -> 206.48s]  back yesterday. I went with burger boy and we got destroyed. We did a chest and triceps
[206.48s -> 211.68s]  workout and I felt like I hadn't worked out ever before in my entire life. Like I was
[211.68s -> 217.36s]  so tired and my muscles are so sore right now. But forget about all that. I want to
[217.36s -> 223.94s]  talk about, I want to talk to you guys specifically about my workout routine and my workout story.
[223.94s -> 228.02s]  And maybe after listening to this commentary, if you were on the fence before, maybe you'll
[228.02s -> 233.22s]  start doing it too. Cause I mean, I do get asked this quite often, at least in PMs.
[233.22s -> 236.66s]  I mean, not, it's not like every single day somebody's like, how do you do workouts? But
[236.66s -> 240.18s]  I have been asked a couple of times. So I do want to get this video out so people can
[240.18s -> 248.68s]  understand that here's my story. I was a little, little dude back when I was in high school.
[248.68s -> 257.29s]  I probably was 115 pounds. I was like five, two, and I was 115 pounds. And after I got
[257.33s -> 261.25s]  out of high school, I went to college. I gained a little bit of weight in college. I went
[261.25s -> 268.25s]  to probably 135 or like 138 in college. And after college, that's kind of when I said
[268.25s -> 274.97s]  okay, I am getting really sick and tired of being the smallest person in the room. I would
[274.97s -> 278.85s]  look around and see everybody was bigger than me. Everyone was stronger than me. And I got
[278.85s -> 284.74s]  sick of that. And even in talking about women and relationship stuff, I wanted to be more
[284.74s -> 290.22s]  desirable. I wanted to be a guy that girls would point to and say, wow, he's look at
[290.22s -> 295.82s]  that. Look at those arms. And plus I wanted to get healthier too, because I have always
[295.82s -> 299.76s]  been kind of like a health nut. I've always wanted to be the healthiest I can be. And
[299.76s -> 304.16s]  I mean, it's not like I didn't try this before. I never really worked out that much, but I
[304.16s -> 311.27s]  did try to put on weight and oh my God, I could not put on one pound to save my life.
[311.27s -> 317.30s]  I could eat 25 double cheeseburgers from McDonald's and I wouldn't gain one pound.
[317.30s -> 322.78s]  And I was always so naive. I really did think that eating garbage fatty foods was going
[322.78s -> 328.30s]  to make me bigger and make me gain weight. But that's not really what that stuff does.
[328.30s -> 333.18s]  You'll gain weight if you eat cheeseburgers or if you eat something really bad for you.
[333.18s -> 337.46s]  You'll gain weight, but it's not the type of weight that you want to gain. Yeah, I mean,
[337.46s -> 341.82s]  maybe you'll gain four or five pounds, but it'll all be in your butt cheeks. Like you
[341.82s -> 346.98s]  won't get like biceps by eating McDonald's. I'll tell you that right now. And to sort
[346.98s -> 351.70s]  of end this video, I want to talk about what it's really done for me and what it can really
[351.70s -> 356.22s]  do for you too. If you start working out, if you really get into it, I've seen such
[356.22s -> 362.55s]  massive results guys. I've gained probably at least 40 or 50 pounds since I started a
[362.55s -> 366.19s]  couple of years ago. And even though I have slowed down a little bit, I'm trying to get
[366.19s -> 371.59s]  back into it now. But I've just seen such amazing results over the last couple of years.
[371.59s -> 376.91s]  I got as strong as an ox too. And I'm not the smallest guy in the room anymore. I'm
[376.91s -> 382.19s]  one of the bigger guys in the room. And that alone is so insane for your confidence. If
[382.19s -> 387.89s]  you can get to a point where you look in the mirror and you go, who's that guy? Oh my God,
[387.89s -> 392.37s]  you will feel so much better about yourself. And it's done so many good things for me.
[392.37s -> 397.81s]  So maybe in the future, I'll make another video like this describing my actual routine
[397.81s -> 402.01s]  and some of the things I do on a daily basis to stay healthy and to gain weight and to
[402.01s -> 405.89s]  get bigger. But for now, I just wanted to give you that little story. So I will see
[405.89s -> 409.73s]  you guys all soon. Take care, everybody.
