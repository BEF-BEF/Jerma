[1.46s -> 1.96s]  What's up?
[1.96s -> 8.49s]  I guess Kimmel didn't do much for him.
[8.49s -> 14.26s]  Will you guys stop saying the words Jimmy and Kimmel right next to each other?
[14.26s -> 23.36s]  What do you mean? Of course somebody said it. I just read it.
[23.36s -> 26.55s]  Oh, he uses Reddit. Alright, easy. Fuckin' loser.
[26.55s -> 65.75s]  Give me one sec. Sorry, I just had to tweet about it.
[65.75s -> 73.57s]  Guys, I get like... I get like 200 plus people instantly from Twitter.
[73.57s -> 78.51s]  I have to tweet it. Sometimes 400.
[78.51s -> 82.48s]  Why are you laughing?
[82.48s -> 89.18s]  I guess I'm laughing too. We're both laughing.
[89.18s -> 94.21s]  What are we doing today? A couple of things.
[94.21s -> 98.09s]  Continuing our just grab bag week.
[98.09s -> 100.09s]  Just pulling games out of a hat.
[100.09s -> 102.78s]  Because we've got a whole plan.
[102.78s -> 104.95s]  Next week and the week after that.
[104.95s -> 108.22s]  Jobby Bunny is tomorrow.
[108.22s -> 112.55s]  If you are wondering.
[112.55s -> 114.92s]  As well as Hive Mind.
[114.92s -> 118.92s]  Which is something I've been looking forward to playing for a pretty long time actually.
[118.92s -> 122.86s]  Hive Mind is a game that was made by somebody in the community.
[122.86s -> 126.36s]  It is a family feud game.
[126.36s -> 128.92s]  That we can play.
[128.92s -> 131.92s]  Where I have to essentially kind of guess what you think.
[131.92s -> 133.92s]  What I think your answers are going to be.
[133.92s -> 139.21s]  He's been working on it for a while. We're probably going to do it tomorrow.
[139.21s -> 141.83s]  And Jobby Bunny is tomorrow too.
[141.83s -> 148.30s]  Remember when you promised Jobby Bunny?
[148.30s -> 151.30s]  I just gave you a date. I just gave you a hard date. It's tomorrow.
[151.30s -> 156.20s]  Am I going to revisit Phasmophobia?
[156.20s -> 159.57s]  I don't know. Maybe.
[159.57s -> 163.70s]  I think the right amount of lightning needs to strike.
[163.70s -> 165.70s]  For four people to be ready in VR.
[165.70s -> 168.71s]  To play that game.
[168.71s -> 170.71s]  I was the guy that didn't have VR.
[170.71s -> 176.02s]  You said that you would eat an egg.
[176.02s -> 177.02s]  What egg?
[177.02s -> 184.00s]  We're doing face cam today? No. Face cam tomorrow.
[184.00s -> 190.14s]  Fix your VR.
[190.14s -> 192.70s]  Should we tell him?
[192.70s -> 195.70s]  Should we tell him that I streamed VR for like two weeks?
[195.70s -> 202.25s]  Don't tell that person that I already streamed VR for like two weeks.
[202.25s -> 205.25s]  Alright. Let me clear my throat off.
[205.25s -> 214.21s]  Why is there a slug emote?
[214.21s -> 219.21s]  I added Jerma Slug Pug and everyone was really mad at me.
[219.21s -> 221.64s]  But now I'm in that weird awful place.
[221.64s -> 224.64s]  Where half of the people that use that emote.
[224.64s -> 226.64s]  That think it's really funny.
[226.64s -> 227.64s]  They love that shit.
[227.64s -> 231.64s]  But then the other half of you that almost throw up in your mouth when you see it.
[231.64s -> 233.64s]  And that you want to delete it from the internet.
[233.64s -> 235.64s]  Now I've got half of you that say that too.
[235.64s -> 238.64s]  So now I've got to deal with both of the sides here.
[238.64s -> 241.64s]  That are like, we want slug pug. We don't want slug pug.
[241.64s -> 246.22s]  Then at that point it comes down to what I want, right?
[246.22s -> 247.22s]  And here's what I want.
[247.22s -> 251.94s]  Chaos.
[251.94s -> 253.94s]  So it's working perfectly.
[253.94s -> 256.57s]  Alright, let's play. We're gonna play a couple of games.
[256.57s -> 262.43s]  Oh my god, what's going on today?
[262.43s -> 273.23s]  Oh, what the fuck?
[273.23s -> 276.50s]  Okay. What's happening?
[276.50s -> 281.02s]  I can't get it out. I can't stop it.
[281.02s -> 283.02s]  Is it gone? Okay, it's gone.
[283.02s -> 285.02s]  I don't smoke.
[285.02s -> 287.38s]  I'm dry of water. I swear to god.
[287.38s -> 290.38s]  I'm just fucking over 30.
[290.38s -> 294.52s]  How come 35 is the new 60? This is bullshit.
[294.52s -> 298.98s]  Anyways, we're gonna start with streamer life simulator.
[298.98s -> 301.98s]  Before you freak out, before you throw a rock at me.
[301.98s -> 304.86s]  Just hold on.
[304.86s -> 308.42s]  Listen, I'm not gonna play this all day.
[308.42s -> 310.42s]  I'm gonna play Exanima.
[310.42s -> 312.42s]  Exanima? Right? Yeah.
[312.42s -> 315.42s]  Exanima is a physics based top down dungeon crawler.
[315.42s -> 322.02s]  I made a video on this fucking game like seven years ago.
[322.02s -> 324.02s]  And I was told, it was recommended to me again.
[324.02s -> 327.02s]  They said, hey dude, so much shit has been added to this game.
[327.02s -> 330.02s]  And it's way different and way better than when you played it before.
[330.02s -> 334.02s]  It was a little wonky before. It was like alpha or something.
[334.02s -> 336.02s]  Play it now, please. You'll love it.
[336.02s -> 338.02s]  So I'm like, alright man.
[338.02s -> 342.39s]  I guess the actual 1.0 came out and they updated it a bunch of times.
[342.39s -> 345.39s]  So I'm gonna give it a try. We'll try it again today.
[345.39s -> 349.45s]  But that is before.
[349.45s -> 353.88s]  That is after we're gonna play streamer life simulator.
[353.88s -> 359.77s]  This was also recommended too.
[359.77s -> 362.77s]  And if you don't think I pull from the recommended channel on the discord,
[362.77s -> 365.77s]  then where are these two games coming from?
[365.77s -> 372.53s]  The only reason why I want to play this, one reason,
[372.53s -> 374.53s]  there's only one single solitary reason,
[374.53s -> 378.53s]  is because you play a game in the game to a fake audience.
[378.53s -> 380.53s]  And like that, I don't know why that's funny to me.
[380.53s -> 382.53s]  Is this a cringe game? I don't know what that means.
[382.53s -> 384.53s]  What does that even mean?
[384.53s -> 392.58s]  I don't even know what that means.
[392.58s -> 394.58s]  Look, I already have my settings ready.
[394.58s -> 396.14s]  We make a character.
[396.14s -> 402.58s]  Alright, let's put clothes on this person first of all.
[402.58s -> 409.62s]  Porn game?
[412.05s -> 415.25s]  It's perfect.
[415.25s -> 420.37s]  It is not perfect.
[420.37s -> 423.12s]  Is this just the character? Do I even care?
[423.12s -> 425.12s]  I'm being honest.
[425.12s -> 426.12s]  Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[426.12s -> 428.12s]  There's facial morphing?
[428.12s -> 431.38s]  Low cheek posit? What is this doing?
[431.38s -> 433.38s]  Oh, hold on, this is face morphing.
[435.82s -> 440.62s]  What's with the camera?
[440.62s -> 442.62s]  The camera's freaking me out, man.
[442.62s -> 450.85s]  Okay, that's a little much, but whatever.
[450.85s -> 455.65s]  Is this Chad?
[455.65s -> 459.74s]  Hey, what do you mean?
[459.74s -> 462.69s]  This is me.
[462.69s -> 464.69s]  Ear position? Why does this even matter?
[464.69s -> 473.38s]  I'm just making golem.
[473.38s -> 476.38s]  Eyes. My eyes kind of go like this a little bit.
[476.38s -> 478.38s]  Do they? I don't know, I can't turn the camera on.
[478.38s -> 480.62s]  I don't have any clothes on.
[480.62s -> 482.62s]  I have big eyes. I have big scary eyes.
[482.62s -> 484.62s]  They're like this.
[484.62s -> 486.92s]  I've been told that before.
[486.92s -> 489.92s]  You know that your actual eyeballs are kind of fucking huge?
[489.92s -> 496.19s]  No, I don't have that.
[496.19s -> 498.19s]  Maybe a little bit, maybe like that.
[498.19s -> 502.42s]  Forehead size?
[502.42s -> 505.42s]  I have big eyebrow hinges, whatever these are called.
[505.42s -> 508.30s]  I don't have a big forehead though.
[508.30s -> 512.58s]  My forehead's actually pretty small.
[512.58s -> 515.14s]  I have a small head.
[515.14s -> 521.40s]  It's not tiny though, it's pretty narrow.
[521.40s -> 524.02s]  I can get a better image.
[524.02s -> 526.58s]  Jaw position?
[526.58s -> 531.45s]  Okay, this does not look like me.
[531.45s -> 537.98s]  You look like Pinhead.
[537.98s -> 547.38s]  It doesn't matter.
[547.38s -> 550.46s]  I kind of have a big nose.
[550.46s -> 553.98s]  It's not really big, it's just warped.
[553.98s -> 561.27s]  It's not, I don't have a big nose.
[561.27s -> 563.27s]  I have a warped nose. This is different.
[563.27s -> 565.27s]  People miss get through that all the time.
[565.27s -> 567.83s]  Oh, he's got a big nose.
[567.83s -> 570.83s]  No, no, no, no. It's just crooked at the top and broken and twisted.
[570.83s -> 574.91s]  It just looks bigger.
[574.91s -> 577.98s]  Okay, that's fine.
[577.98s -> 580.22s]  I can actually be glue man?
[580.22s -> 586.24s]  No, no.
[586.24s -> 589.82s]  No, no, no.
[589.82s -> 592.06s]  You make slime guy.
[592.06s -> 594.06s]  Why are all these things in the game?
[594.06s -> 598.16s]  What's the point of this?
[598.16s -> 600.16s]  Arm width.
[600.16s -> 602.16s]  Huge arms.
[602.16s -> 607.54s]  No, I have long arms.
[607.54s -> 614.19s]  I got that big ant stomach now.
[614.19s -> 616.19s]  This is 6'7".
[616.19s -> 618.19s]  6'6", 6'5", 6'4".
[618.19s -> 620.19s]  I don't even know.
[620.19s -> 623.90s]  What height is this?
[623.90s -> 625.90s]  0.5?
[625.90s -> 627.90s]  Neck thickness.
[627.90s -> 629.90s]  I like cartoon pythons
[629.90s -> 631.90s]  swallowed a plate or something.
[631.90s -> 635.94s]  My character right now is going like
[636.94s -> 642.16s]  And then the other secondary character comes over
[642.16s -> 644.16s]  and punches me in the stomach
[644.16s -> 646.16s]  and the whole plate comes out.
[646.16s -> 648.16s]  And the turkey dinner on it too and I eat it and it's normal.
[648.16s -> 653.14s]  Let's do normal.
[653.14s -> 656.66s]  Feet size.
[656.66s -> 663.82s]  Forearm length.
[663.82s -> 665.82s]  I get it.
[665.82s -> 669.66s]  I understand.
[669.66s -> 671.66s]  Leg separation.
[671.66s -> 673.84s]  You know what?
[673.84s -> 675.84s]  I do have pretty big leg separation, don't I?
[675.84s -> 680.45s]  I have short legs.
[680.45s -> 682.45s]  The long thing is
[682.45s -> 684.45s]  I would be so much shorter
[684.45s -> 686.45s]  if I had a shorter torso.
[686.45s -> 688.75s]  I actually have
[688.75s -> 690.75s]  an alien body.
[690.75s -> 692.75s]  I have a really long torso, but short legs.
[692.75s -> 694.75s]  If I had a short torso, I'd be 5'4".
[694.75s -> 702.37s]  So you're compact.
[702.37s -> 706.19s]  Kind of.
[706.19s -> 715.22s]  I'm like an accordion.
[715.22s -> 719.36s]  Upper muscle.
[719.36s -> 722.05s]  Upper weight. A little bit heavy.
[722.05s -> 724.05s]  This looks nothing like me.
[724.05s -> 727.18s]  This is just a weird guy.
[727.18s -> 729.68s]  No eyebrows.
[729.68s -> 733.01s]  Style 1. Style 2.
[733.01s -> 735.01s]  Style 3.
[735.01s -> 740.13s]  They're kind of like this.
[740.13s -> 742.13s]  Eyes. Cat eyes.
[742.13s -> 744.13s]  Alligator eyes.
[744.13s -> 749.55s]  Oh, there we go.
[749.55s -> 751.55s]  My eyes are like a slate gray.
[751.55s -> 753.92s]  I don't have blue eyes.
[753.92s -> 756.54s]  I have a slate gray.
[756.54s -> 759.04s]  Cool.
[759.04s -> 764.08s]  That looks good. What about hair?
[764.08s -> 766.08s]  I'm going to keep it bald for all of you to laugh.
[766.08s -> 772.86s]  I like this look.
[772.86s -> 775.68s]  No shoes.
[775.68s -> 778.50s]  Elf ears?
[778.50s -> 796.46s]  This is good.
[796.46s -> 798.46s]  This doesn't look anything like me.
[798.46s -> 801.92s]  You just said the F word, dude.
[801.92s -> 803.92s]  What do you want me to do?
[803.92s -> 807.50s]  I don't know.
[807.50s -> 809.50s]  I'm too.
[809.50s -> 813.41s]  Hold on a second here.
[813.41s -> 817.25s]  This is not even correct.
[817.25s -> 822.61s]  Now it's a little more correct.
[822.61s -> 827.86s]  There we go. I'm ready.
[827.86s -> 829.86s]  Streamer life, the first installation may take a little longer.
[829.86s -> 831.86s]  You can find some items to sell.
[831.86s -> 834.29s]  You buy gas?
[834.29s -> 836.29s]  You drive a car?
[836.29s -> 838.66s]  Does this get an automatic plus one?
[838.66s -> 840.83s]  Plus A? Plus a letter grade?
[840.83s -> 847.81s]  What do I do?
[847.81s -> 850.82s]  Press the up arrow on the keyboard to open the phone.
[850.82s -> 853.70s]  Welcome.
[853.70s -> 859.89s]  Okay, turn it off.
[859.89s -> 863.73s]  Talk to Mosi.
[863.73s -> 865.73s]  Is this a drug dealer simulator?
[865.73s -> 869.70s]  Hygiene? Toilet? Heat?
[869.70s -> 873.60s]  Messages. Settings.
[873.60s -> 877.95s]  Sound. Alarm. Car assistance.
[877.95s -> 879.95s]  Turn the overturned car
[879.95s -> 884.24s]  back to normal.
[884.24s -> 887.31s]  Spoiler. Thanks.
[887.31s -> 889.31s]  Zuber. Select the location you want to go.
[889.31s -> 892.83s]  Oh, it's like Uber.
[892.83s -> 894.83s]  Health. Current weight 83 pounds.
[894.83s -> 896.83s]  Calories consumed.
[896.83s -> 899.78s]  Recommended calories. Flashlight?
[899.78s -> 903.55s]  Okay.
[903.55s -> 906.69s]  What the fuck is this game?
[906.69s -> 911.42s]  The computer parts in the trunk of the car.
[911.42s -> 916.16s]  Can I pet the dog?
[916.16s -> 919.34s]  How do you pet dog?
[919.34s -> 921.34s]  Do I have to just go home?
[921.34s -> 924.86s]  Talk to Mosi. Put the computer parts in and go home.
[924.86s -> 930.62s]  What the fuck?
[930.62s -> 937.60s]  What is going on?
[937.60s -> 939.60s]  What is this drug dealer simulator?
[939.60s -> 948.82s]  But it's a different video game.
[948.82s -> 953.49s]  I thought it was a streamer.
[953.49s -> 956.37s]  I thought it was a streamer simulator.
[956.37s -> 960.08s]  What happened last night?
[960.08s -> 962.08s]  I can't explain right now. I'm about to faint.
[962.08s -> 964.08s]  What's going on? Money?
[964.08s -> 966.32s]  I said buy a computer to pay me your debt.
[966.32s -> 969.20s]  The computer is in front of the door.
[969.20s -> 973.04s]  Now fuck off.
[973.04s -> 976.35s]  Okay.
[976.35s -> 978.35s]  Press E to get it in your hand.
[978.35s -> 980.35s]  What? X47?
[980.35s -> 982.35s]  This is a real motherboard.
[982.35s -> 989.63s]  Isn't that a real motherboard?
[989.63s -> 991.63s]  Press E to get it in your hand.
[991.63s -> 995.92s]  Press and hold to put it in the bag.
[995.92s -> 999.92s]  Okay. Why do all motherboards have the exact same name then?
[999.92s -> 1003.18s]  How do I put a legendary monitor?
[1003.18s -> 1005.18s]  Why does it have rarity?
[1005.18s -> 1008.13s]  Old case.
[1008.13s -> 1013.38s]  Oh my god. What is all this?
[1013.38s -> 1016.70s]  Do I have to build a computer?
[1016.70s -> 1020.35s]  The Samsung 03.
[1020.35s -> 1022.35s]  That's a great way to not get sued.
[1022.35s -> 1024.35s]  You've done a great job. I can't carry any more items.
[1024.35s -> 1033.49s]  What? Where the hell do we live?

[1361.09s -> 1365.10s]  Okay. Put this on the table.
[1365.10s -> 1368.75s]  Now. How do I get my backpack?
[1368.75s -> 1372.21s]  How do I open up my actual backpack?

[1419.50s -> 1428.02s]  desktop PC. Rotate
[1428.02s -> 1432.37s]  this. Okay. Whoa!
[1432.37s -> 1436.08s]  Wait. The computer's already done?

[1479.41s -> 1482.42s]  You should do. I don't know.
[1482.42s -> 1487.66s]  I don't know how to do that. Streamer.
[1487.66s -> 1496.05s]  Is it a skill? What the fuck?
[1496.05s -> 1501.02s]  What? What is
[1501.02s -> 1503.02s]  all this? Make stream and get
[1503.02s -> 1511.34s]  a stream crown. Open extra
[1511.34s -> 1514.29s]  slots. Where's the P

[1542.96s -> 1544.96s]  Close this shit up. Okay. Put this
[1544.96s -> 1546.96s]  down here. That's actually where my
[1546.96s -> 1549.33s]  PC is right now.
[1549.33s -> 1551.33s]  I'm actually going to make this my streamer room.
[1551.33s -> 1554.00s]  What's wrong with it? Why is there an exclamation point?
[1554.00s -> 1560.08s]  Okay. Keyboard. Go to the bathroom.
[1560.08s -> 1562.08s]  I don't know how.

[1659.34s -> 1661.97s]  Ice cream? How much money do I have?
[1661.97s -> 1664.58s]  I don't want to do this.
[1664.58s -> 1666.58s]  Why is there an ice cream vendor just right outside of my
[1666.58s -> 1677.33s]  house? Alright. I need to
[1677.33s -> 1680.72s]  go back to that guy's house. Do not
[1680.72s -> 1695.70s]  hit anybody. Don't hit anybody.
[1695.70s -> 1697.70s]  I already have it in the trunk?
[1697.70s -> 1702.42s]  Do I? I don't have a video card.

[1721.86s -> 1723.86s]  to turn up my stream for the first time.
[1723.86s -> 1736.58s]  Hard drive. Is it an SSD?
[1736.58s -> 1740.10s]  Is it the graphics card?
[1740.10s -> 1742.10s]  Is it the CPU?
[1742.10s -> 1746.88s]  And here's the RAM. Let's go.
[1746.88s -> 1749.06s]  Let's go. My first stream.

[1805.09s -> 1807.09s]  Register on the Blender website?
[1807.09s -> 1810.42s]  What's wrong with the keyboard? Go to
[1810.42s -> 1812.42s]  the club. I'm not going to the club right now.
[1812.42s -> 1814.42s]  I'm busy. I'm trying to set up my first fucking

[1818.38s -> 1820.38s]  that I was going to play this today. Fuck me.
[1820.38s -> 1826.38s]  Shit.

[1828.38s -> 1830.38s]  of like me streaming Fortnite.
[1830.38s -> 1832.82s]  And like when I zoomed in to like start
[1832.82s -> 1834.82s]  the stream I would just play the video. God damn it.

[1842.05s -> 1850.18s]  Turn it on. Am I doing something wrong?
[1850.18s -> 1852.99s]  I need to eat food.
[1852.99s -> 1854.99s]  I tried to buy an ice cream. It didn't let me.
[1854.99s -> 1858.19s]  A case? What's wrong with it?
[1858.19s -> 1860.19s]  Oh.

[1874.72s -> 1876.72s]  What the hell is that opening sound?
[1876.72s -> 1880.82s]  This computer sucks.
[1880.82s -> 1883.12s]  You're not my type.
[1883.12s -> 1886.70s]  What is this?
[1886.70s -> 1894.00s]  Stream calendar?
[1894.00s -> 1900.66s]  Let's see by internet speed. It's pretty bad.
[1900.66s -> 1902.66s]  It's really bad. I'm going to have to do
[1902.66s -> 1904.66s]  soar enough.
[1904.66s -> 1909.71s]  Alright. Let's see how good my

[1911.71s -> 1914.59s]  Yeah. It's pretty bad.
[1914.59s -> 1916.59s]  You can't stream with a connection that's
[1916.59s -> 1919.92s]  this bad. You can't stream.
[1919.92s -> 1921.92s]  You can't stream at like 400k
[1921.92s -> 1923.92s]  up. It doesn't work.
[1923.92s -> 1927.06s]  Even Hearthstone would look bad

[2016.83s -> 2018.83s]  life that scared the shit out of me.

[2033.07s -> 2036.59s]  Oh, ugh.
[2036.59s -> 2039.66s]  Alright. Thank you. Didn't even put it
[2039.66s -> 2041.66s]  in a bag. Worst
[2041.66s -> 2044.99s]  fucking Uber Eats driver.
[2044.99s -> 2050.88s]  Okay. Eat. Okay. How am I doing?
[2050.88s -> 2052.88s]  I need to go to the bathroom.
[2052.88s -> 2064.27s]  You ate the plate, too. Yeah.
[2064.27s -> 2067.15s]  I should do my toilet urgent.
[2067.15s -> 2069.15s]  I don't have a toilet, man. You keep saying that.
[2069.15s -> 2076.37s]  What the fuck just happened?
[2076.37s -> 2079.70s]  Alright. Turn the computer on.
[2079.70s -> 2081.70s]  Do you have people walking by this window?
[2081.70s -> 2085.22s]  Hey, Klawski. Thanks for the
[2085.22s -> 2087.22s]  10 community subs. Appreciate it.
[2087.22s -> 2094.32s]  Move your desk, please.
[2094.32s -> 2097.97s]  Find a toilet. I'm going to have to
[2097.97s -> 2105.14s]  buy one. There's an outside
[2105.14s -> 2107.14s]  outhouse. Is there really?
[2107.14s -> 2111.81s]  Alright. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[2111.81s -> 2116.72s]  Ooh. What the fuck?
[2116.72s -> 2124.45s]  Outhouse. Where is it?
[2124.45s -> 2128.48s]  Do you know where the bathroom is?
[2128.48s -> 2130.48s]  Where's the bathroom? I need a bathroom.
[2130.48s -> 2133.17s]  Excuse me, sir.
[2133.17s -> 2135.92s]  Do you know where I can find a bathroom?
[2135.92s -> 2139.95s]  You scares me. Do you know where I can find a bathroom?
[2139.95s -> 2146.86s]  There is no outhouse.
[2146.86s -> 2156.90s]  Joe Biden?
[2156.90s -> 2159.90s]  Ooh. Bathroom. Bathroom.
[2159.90s -> 2162.72s]  You got a bathroom in here?
[2162.72s -> 2167.01s]  Shit. Wait. You can buy stuff?
[2167.01s -> 2169.01s]  This is like a computer place.
[2169.01s -> 2172.08s]  Isn't this the guy that sells ice cream?
[2172.08s -> 2180.83s]  Uh, I'll be back.
[2180.83s -> 2184.22s]  Why are there no toilets?
[2184.22s -> 2186.22s]  Thank you, Sakamoto, for the 10 community subs.
[2186.22s -> 2190.06s]  Where's my house?
[2190.06s -> 2198.70s]  I have to buy a toilet. That's the only way
[2198.70s -> 2200.94s]  this is going to work. Thanks for the subs though, really.
[2200.94s -> 2211.17s]  Okay. Wait, I didn't turn
[2211.17s -> 2213.17s]  it off. I didn't turn it off. I didn't turn it off. Why didn't I turn it off?
[2213.17s -> 2215.17s]  Oh, my stream deck's wrong.
[2215.17s -> 2217.34s]  My stream deck's wrong. There we go.
[2217.34s -> 2236.08s]  180
[2236.08s -> 2241.65s]  bucks. Wow,
[2241.65s -> 2243.95s]  dude. You don't
[2243.95s -> 2245.95s]  $180 a month?
[2245.95s -> 2249.47s]  Let's go, boys. No.
[2249.47s -> 2253.76s]  Let's not go. Job King.
[2253.76s -> 2263.49s]  I have to go to the Blender. Wait, wait.
[2263.49s -> 2265.49s]  No, no, no. Fuck this. We're going to Blender.
[2265.49s -> 2268.50s]  Whatever the hell that is. I think that's a
[2268.50s -> 2278.22s]  dig at Mixer.
[2278.22s -> 2282.32s]  I'm going to take a shit. I need to buy a better
[2282.32s -> 2284.32s]  internet. This internet's so bad.
[2284.32s -> 2286.32s]  This is triggering such a response
[2286.32s -> 2290.03s]  in me. How many times have you been sitting
[2290.03s -> 2292.03s]  there with like your phone or like a device
[2292.03s -> 2294.03s]  and it just does that and you just rage?
[2294.03s -> 2296.40s]  942
[2296.40s -> 2298.40s]  thousand people are watching streams right now.
[2298.40s -> 2306.53s]  Okay. Wait, am I on here?
[2306.53s -> 2309.34s]  I mean, is Zerma
[2309.34s -> 2311.34s]  on here? Is Zerma on here? Is Zerma
[2311.34s -> 2313.34s]  985 on here? Let's find out. Come on.
[2313.34s -> 2321.01s]  Come on. It's a
[2321.01s -> 2323.01s]  play on like all streamers.
[2323.01s -> 2326.02s]  I got to be on here. Come on, dude.
[2326.02s -> 2329.02s]  Let me see.
[2329.02s -> 2331.39s]  I'm not important enough.
[2331.39s -> 2337.22s]  Alright, so let's watch
[2337.22s -> 2339.22s]  what game is this? The thing, The Witcher?
[2339.22s -> 2346.77s]  Everybody's at the same
[2346.77s -> 2348.77s]  part of The Witcher 3.
[2348.77s -> 2353.25s]  You all started your
[2353.25s -> 2355.25s]  streams at the exact same time on launch
[2355.25s -> 2358.58s]  day. Okay, well,
[2358.58s -> 2361.33s]  register. Enter. Oh, okay.
[2361.33s -> 2372.00s]  Registration complete.
[2372.00s -> 2374.00s]  I have to scan my finger print.
[2374.00s -> 2380.46s]  Alright.
[2380.46s -> 2385.26s]  Here comes Zerma. Login.
[2385.26s -> 2389.34s]  Zerma.
[2389.34s -> 2391.34s]  Do I have to start my stream? Become a
[2391.34s -> 2393.34s]  partner. I have to stream for a while
[2393.34s -> 2397.31s]  first, don't I? Dashboard
[2397.31s -> 2399.31s]  followers. That's my stream key.
[2399.31s -> 2403.86s]  That would be so bad if that was how it
[2403.86s -> 2408.78s]  actually worked. Can you imagine if
[2408.78s -> 2411.15s]  it was only four digits?
[2411.15s -> 2413.15s]  You would be able to just guess half of the
[2413.15s -> 2416.22s]  people's accounts. Okay, advertising
[2416.22s -> 2418.22s]  revenue. Lenders share. Seventy percent.
[2418.22s -> 2420.22s]  Expected earnings. Subscription goal.
[2420.22s -> 2422.22s]  Average live viewer is zero.
[2422.22s -> 2426.26s]  Alright, let's...
[2426.26s -> 2428.26s]  I should do my toilet. That's not important.
[2428.26s -> 2430.26s]  Ad duration. No, no, no. No ads.
[2430.26s -> 2432.26s]  No ads in the very beginning. Stream name.
[2432.26s -> 2434.94s]  That's stream one. That's not going to bring any eyeballs.
[2439.55s -> 2446.27s]  Right? Like, aces only.
[2446.27s -> 2451.39s]  How do I stream?
[2451.39s -> 2455.04s]  Free subscription to one streamer.
[2455.04s -> 2458.37s]  Special in-game loot.
[2458.37s -> 2463.10s]  Get free games every month.
[2463.10s -> 2465.86s]  How do I stream? Become a
[2465.86s -> 2467.86s]  partner. Get invited to special streamer
[2467.86s -> 2469.86s]  events organized by Blender.
[2469.86s -> 2471.86s]  Okay. Blender shares drop by
[2471.86s -> 2474.16s]  fifteen percent. Faster Blender
[2474.16s -> 2476.16s]  support. Chance to join streamers
[2476.16s -> 2480.19s]  recommended by Blender. Oh, I need to have
[2480.19s -> 2482.19s]  four hundred live active viewers and
[2482.19s -> 2486.85s]  a hundred subs. Oh.
[2486.85s -> 2488.85s]  Well. Download the OPS
[2488.85s -> 2490.85s]  program from the app's website.
[2490.85s -> 2492.85s]  Why is this way more detailed than I thought it was going to be?
[2492.85s -> 2499.50s]  Apps? Go get the OBS.
[2499.50s -> 2504.37s]  Buy a microphone.
[2504.37s -> 2506.37s]  Send all money to your
[2506.37s -> 2513.28s]  credit card from the bank app.
[2513.28s -> 2515.28s]  Steam. An application that you can
[2515.28s -> 2517.28s]  download and play. Okay, we're going to do OBS.
[2517.28s -> 2521.63s]  Oh, my download sucks though.
[2521.63s -> 2523.63s]  This is going to take so long.
[2523.63s -> 2526.96s]  This sucks. Buy a microphone
[2526.96s -> 2528.96s]  from the Zamazor website.
[2528.96s -> 2537.73s]  Watch something. Alright, hold on.
[2537.73s -> 2539.73s]  Wait, wait, wait. Okay. Buy a microphone.
[2539.73s -> 2546.50s]  From Zamazor.
[2546.50s -> 2550.85s]  I'm very hungry. Hold on.
[2550.85s -> 2554.62s]  Where's Zamazor?
[2554.62s -> 2556.62s]  Buy a microphone from the Zamazor website.
[2556.62s -> 2560.51s]  Oh, there it is.
[2560.51s -> 2563.46s]  Why is it not Zamazon? Oh, right.
[2563.46s -> 2565.46s]  Because it actually says Amazon.
[2565.46s -> 2570.96s]  If you make it Zamazon.
[2570.96s -> 2574.16s]  And I'll buy a toilet too.
[2574.16s -> 2576.16s]  Okay. We need
[2576.16s -> 2578.16s]  furniture.
[2578.16s -> 2580.16s]  Toilet's furniture.
[2580.16s -> 2582.16s]  Yes, it is. Thank God.
[2582.16s -> 2588.11s]  And a
[2588.11s -> 2595.34s]  What else? We need a microphone.
[2595.34s -> 2598.74s]  Look at this thing.
[2598.74s -> 2600.74s]  Like a WWF mic.
[2600.74s -> 2602.74s]  I need the cheap one. I don't have any money.
[2602.74s -> 2606.50s]  This is a really bad rating.
[2606.50s -> 2608.50s]  Quality sound in this microphone.
[2608.50s -> 2610.50s]  97 bucks. Get it.
[2610.50s -> 2613.68s]  Alright. Toilet and a microphone.
[2613.68s -> 2615.68s]  Only the essentials from Amazon.
[2615.68s -> 2619.95s]  I can't afford it.
[2619.95s -> 2621.95s]  Shit. Okay.
[2621.95s -> 2625.14s]  We can't have a toilet.
[2625.14s -> 2629.87s]  A cheaper toilet.
[2629.87s -> 2631.87s]  Do they have cheaper toilets? 420.
[2631.87s -> 2635.71s]  Oh, 215. Here we go.
[2635.71s -> 2639.04s]  Alright. When do they show up?
[2639.04s -> 2641.04s]  Give me my microphone. Give me my toilet.
[2641.04s -> 2647.38s]  Oh, here it comes. Don't ring the bell, please.
[2647.38s -> 2651.66s]  Oh, no. That wasn't it.
[2651.66s -> 2654.86s]  Download Fortnite.
[2654.86s -> 2658.26s]  Hold on. I can't
[2658.26s -> 2660.69s]  download Fortnite yet.
[2660.69s -> 2663.31s]  Wait. Does this take like a couple of days?
[2663.31s -> 2666.51s]  I'm sure it does.
[2666.51s -> 2671.57s]  Alright. I can just send money to a credit card.
[2671.57s -> 2673.57s]  Oh, this is my shitty computer.
[2673.57s -> 2676.64s]  I gotta go to the bank app.
[2676.64s -> 2681.70s]  No Amazon Prime.
[2681.70s -> 2684.06s]  Pepe left.
[2684.06s -> 2686.06s]  Alright. Fuck this. I'm gonna
[2686.06s -> 2689.89s]  Where's my bank?
[2689.89s -> 2691.89s]  Way too many apps. Get rid of that shit.
[2691.89s -> 2700.66s]  I don't have enough money to do a ZornHub account.
[2700.66s -> 2705.14s]  What happened to the burrito?
[2705.14s -> 2709.42s]  Okay. Money transfer.
[2709.42s -> 2711.73s]  Complete the transfer. I now have $800
[2711.73s -> 2717.17s]  in my account.
[2717.17s -> 2720.37s]  I need to transfer to my credit card.
[2720.37s -> 2722.37s]  Transfer to card.
[2722.37s -> 2726.70s]  All your money.
[2726.70s -> 2728.70s]  So I've got $918 on this
[2728.70s -> 2730.70s]  credit card. That's enough to buy a ZornHub account.
[2730.70s -> 2737.09s]  Why did that not work?
[2737.09s -> 2742.27s]  Didn't that be a quest?
[2742.27s -> 2748.42s]  Don't fucking do it.
[2748.42s -> 2753.60s]  Oh, on the phone.
[2753.60s -> 2755.60s]  Why use the phone app when you have access to the desktop
[2755.60s -> 2757.60s]  application? They're always ten times better.
[2757.60s -> 2760.98s]  Alright. Transfer to my account.
[2760.98s -> 2762.98s]  Like $70.
[2762.98s -> 2764.98s]  Now I'm gonna transfer all this. We're gonna open up the bank.
[2764.98s -> 2776.16s]  Where's my bank account?
[2776.16s -> 2778.16s]  Send all money to your credit card.
[2778.16s -> 2781.81s]  Thank you.
[2781.81s -> 2783.81s]  Sleep and save the game. Sure thing.
[2783.81s -> 2789.74s]  Now deliveries will be there. Cough.
[2789.74s -> 2792.30s]  Murmur. Turn left.
[2792.30s -> 2796.13s]  Okay. I did it.
[2796.13s -> 2800.72s]  I need to order some food, too.
[2800.72s -> 2804.05s]  Delivery? Oh, what?
[2804.05s -> 2808.34s]  I gotta order food. I gotta order a lot of food.
[2808.34s -> 2815.70s]  I'm gonna get like five things.
[2815.70s -> 2819.98s]  It's in the dumpster. Okay.
[2819.98s -> 2821.98s]  I gotta go to food shop.
[2821.98s -> 2823.98s]  And I'm gonna order like three burritos.
[2823.98s -> 2825.98s]  I'm gonna order two Big Macs. Two McChicken sandwiches.
[2825.98s -> 2831.04s]  A large fry and a large Coke.
[2831.04s -> 2838.27s]  Get the German meal.
[2838.27s -> 2840.27s]  Lamb rack? Mushroom bucket.
[2840.27s -> 2843.09s]  Ugh. Who would order this?
[2843.09s -> 2845.09s]  Just only
[2845.09s -> 2847.97s]  mushrooms?
[2847.97s -> 2851.62s]  Octopus balls?
[2851.62s -> 2853.62s]  Parfait? A pierogi?
[2853.62s -> 2855.62s]  Of just a whole pig? It's $8.
[2855.62s -> 2859.25s]  Baked beans.
[2859.25s -> 2863.92s]  Alright, we're gonna just get a shitload of these.
[2863.92s -> 2870.77s]  Alright, we're gonna get a bunch of beans and candy.
[2870.77s -> 2874.21s]  And some dog food.
[2874.21s -> 2876.21s]  Don't we have a dog? No, that was the other guy's house.
[2876.21s -> 2879.09s]  Alright, wait, wait. Get some actual food.
[2879.09s -> 2885.15s]  Okay.
[2885.15s -> 2887.15s]  When you get a post-bates
[2887.15s -> 2889.15s]  or Uber Eats or like a Grubhub order like this
[2889.15s -> 2891.15s]  you're just like, come on, dude. Like, fuck you.
[2891.15s -> 2894.42s]  Am I really gonna go get you
[2894.42s -> 2896.42s]  12 cans of beans and like
[2896.42s -> 2898.42s]  a bag of dog food?
[2898.42s -> 2906.85s]  Come on, man. That's a lot of money.
[2906.85s -> 2912.03s]  I'm very hungry.
[2912.03s -> 2915.42s]  Three whole pigs.
[2915.42s -> 2917.42s]  I wanna see them put this over here.
[2917.42s -> 2919.42s]  I'm gonna be the-
[2919.42s -> 2921.42s]  Dude! The smile's on the box!
[2921.42s -> 2924.11s]  Oh shit, hold on.
[2924.11s -> 2933.89s]  Oops.
[2933.89s -> 2936.38s]  Don't throw the microphone.
[2936.38s -> 2938.38s]  Alright, hold on. What the fuck?
[2938.38s -> 2942.54s]  Hey!
[2942.54s -> 2944.54s]  Okay, I ordered-
[2944.54s -> 2946.54s]  I ordered enough food for the Super Bowl party
[2946.54s -> 2949.55s]  I'm gonna have.
[2949.55s -> 2951.98s]  Let me put this down.
[2951.98s -> 2953.98s]  What is this thing? This is like a bar of Rice Crispy Street.
[2953.98s -> 2956.67s]  Alright, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat.
[2956.67s -> 2958.67s]  Wait, where's my other Amazon order?
[2958.67s -> 2966.67s]  Okay, no. Pick that up.
[2966.67s -> 2971.84s]  Alright, where's the bathroom? I don't have a bathroom.
[2971.84s -> 2973.84s]  I think this is supposed to be the bathroom
[2973.84s -> 2975.84s]  but this is my streamer room.
[2975.84s -> 2978.45s]  So, you know, whatever.
[2978.45s -> 2986.83s]  Press to make your toilet.
[2986.83s -> 2995.47s]  I have to go again.
[2995.47s -> 3004.50s]  Twice.
[3004.50s -> 3006.50s]  I've had- Hey, do not-
[3006.50s -> 3008.50s]  Everybody that's freaking out right now is saying, what the fuck?
[3008.50s -> 3010.50s]  No. How many times have you done that before?
[3010.50s -> 3012.50s]  You did a full 30 or 40 second piss
[3012.50s -> 3014.50s]  and then-
[3014.50s -> 3016.50s]  Okay, here comes another one. Here comes another full
[3016.50s -> 3023.54s]  30 second piss.
[3023.54s -> 3028.02s]  Okay, I gotta eat this whole pig.
[3028.02s -> 3034.48s]  No, my mic!
[3034.48s -> 3036.48s]  I have so much food.
[3036.48s -> 3038.48s]  Do I have a fridge?
[3038.48s -> 3041.36s]  Does this food go bad?
[3041.36s -> 3048.46s]  Okay, I got a lot of canned food though.
[3048.46s -> 3055.87s]  What does this build?
[3055.87s -> 3060.54s]  Uh oh. What? Okay.
[3060.54s -> 3067.58s]  Let's just gonna have to stay there.
[3067.58s -> 3070.46s]  Alright.
[3070.46s -> 3086.32s]  I'm not doing this all day.
[3086.32s -> 3088.62s]  This will work eventually.
[3088.62s -> 3094.32s]  This is canned food, it's fine.
[3094.32s -> 3096.56s]  I just ate the dog food.
[3096.56s -> 3098.56s]  Didn't throw this dog food.
[3098.56s -> 3107.38s]  Candy!
[3107.38s -> 3117.55s]  I can't even pick these up.
[3117.55s -> 3120.94s]  I was just seeing if I could break the glass.
[3120.94s -> 3122.94s]  What the- Hey, come on.
[3122.94s -> 3126.90s]  Wait, I can do- There we go.
[3126.90s -> 3128.90s]  Candy Andy.
[3128.90s -> 3131.14s]  That's me.
[3131.14s -> 3148.59s]  Candy Andy.
[3148.59s -> 3152.24s]  I feel so dirty.
[3152.24s -> 3155.82s]  Look, just let me get one stream in
[3155.82s -> 3157.82s]  and I'll make millions.
[3157.82s -> 3171.44s]  Doesn't matter.
[3171.44s -> 3177.25s]  Back up, back up.
[3177.25s -> 3179.42s]  First person sims.
[3179.42s -> 3184.35s]  Okay, I did it. Turn the computer on.
[3184.35s -> 3200.08s]  I'm ready for my first stream.
[3200.08s -> 3206.99s]  Your P gauge replenished all the way.
[3206.99s -> 3209.68s]  Okay, I've got OBS. Stream key.
[3209.68s -> 3212.94s]  Link your blender account and start streaming.
[3212.94s -> 3214.94s]  Set the highest quality broadcast based on your current upload speed.
[3214.94s -> 3218.02s]  Alright.
[3218.02s -> 3222.56s]  I don't need any more food. Come on, hurry the fuck up.
[3222.56s -> 3227.17s]  What's the stream key?
[3227.17s -> 3229.73s]  It was 1390, yeah.
[3229.73s -> 3232.10s]  Blender.
[3232.10s -> 3235.62s]  I have OBS.
[3235.62s -> 3237.62s]  1394.
[3237.62s -> 3239.62s]  1390.
[3239.62s -> 3243.12s]  Okay.
[3243.12s -> 3246.26s]  Oh, shit. Stream quality.
[3246.26s -> 3248.50s]  144p.
[3248.50s -> 3250.50s]  Show cam.
[3250.50s -> 3252.93s]  Oh, I don't have a cam.
[3252.93s -> 3254.93s]  30 fps, I can't handle anything else.
[3254.93s -> 3258.90s]  Recommended bitrate, 700.
[3258.90s -> 3260.90s]  Stream category.
[3260.90s -> 3263.33s]  Okay, just chatting. Stream settings.
[3263.33s -> 3272.66s]  Okay.
[3272.66s -> 3275.47s]  The lowest bitrate you can have is 100.
[3275.47s -> 3277.47s]  The lowest bitrate you can have is 100?
[3277.47s -> 3282.58s]  Oh.
[3282.58s -> 3284.58s]  400.
[3284.58s -> 3290.06s]  Oh, fuck. I wasn't ready.
[3299.52s -> 3301.52s]  Just like everybody's first stream, okay?
[3301.52s -> 3303.89s]  No one's watching the stream.
[3303.89s -> 3305.89s]  Wait silently.
[3305.89s -> 3309.73s]  Listen, every single person that
[3309.73s -> 3311.73s]  started a Twitch account, there's somebody here.
[3311.73s -> 3321.50s]  Yo! How long is the stream?
[3321.50s -> 3323.81s]  Just...
[3323.81s -> 3325.81s]  Just messing with some settings.
[3325.81s -> 3327.81s]  You are obese.
[3338.30s -> 3344.05s]  You are...
[3344.05s -> 3346.05s]  Yeah, sorry for that. Or you are
[3346.05s -> 3352.19s]  all stupid.
[3352.19s -> 3354.19s]  How many people here listen to music?
[3354.19s -> 3358.99s]  No, I don't like music.
[3358.99s -> 3360.99s]  Drop, drop, drop. You can't even
[3360.99s -> 3362.99s]  speak properly. I think throw your computer in the trash.
[3362.99s -> 3364.99s]  Fuck you, buddy.
[3364.99s -> 3369.66s]  Go watch another stream if you don't
[3369.66s -> 3372.03s]  like it. Oh, wait.
[3372.03s -> 3376.96s]  I banned that person?
[3376.96s -> 3381.18s]  Two viewers fight each other.
[3381.18s -> 3383.18s]  Warn them. Say, easy. Cut it out.
[3383.18s -> 3390.67s]  I feel so dirty.
[3390.67s -> 3395.15s]  If I wasn't sleepy. What's up?
[3395.15s -> 3397.15s]  Hey!
[3397.15s -> 3399.15s]  There's someone who says he can never be
[3399.15s -> 3402.48s]  a streamer. This does not concern
[3402.48s -> 3404.48s]  him at all. I think he's right.
[3404.48s -> 3412.74s]  Stream a game.
[3412.74s -> 3414.74s]  Oh, shit. Hold on. Okay.
[3414.74s -> 3418.11s]  Uh, game.
[3418.11s -> 3420.11s]  Wait, I'm lying. I'm faking
[3420.11s -> 3422.67s]  the category. There's someone who says he can
[3422.67s -> 3425.81s]  never be a streamer. That doesn't concern me.
[3425.81s -> 3432.21s]  I need a game. Hey!
[3432.21s -> 3434.21s]  You ever seen this before?
[3434.21s -> 3440.03s]  Speedrun
[3440.03s -> 3442.21s]  ban incoming. Donate
[3442.21s -> 3447.65s]  received. Have you ever...
[3447.65s -> 3449.65s]  Have you ever been stealing?
[3449.65s -> 3463.20s]  Never.
[3463.20s -> 3465.20s]  First stream. I'm gonna get banned.
[3465.20s -> 3468.66s]  Wait, I'm getting donations.
[3468.66s -> 3477.98s]  Hey!
[3477.98s -> 3480.35s]  Why are you hacking me?
[3480.35s -> 3482.35s]  L, R,
[3482.35s -> 3485.34s]  R, L,
[3485.34s -> 3487.34s]  O. What happened?
[3487.34s -> 3489.34s]  You have been hacked. You lost
[3489.34s -> 3498.75s]  $200. How?
[3498.75s -> 3501.89s]  Have you ever been stealing
[3501.89s -> 3503.89s]  one day?
[3503.89s -> 3520.27s]  What are these? Okay.
[3520.27s -> 3522.27s]  I am about to get
[3522.27s -> 3525.09s]  banned in real life
[3525.09s -> 3527.52s]  in the game while I'm
[3527.52s -> 3529.52s]  pretending to get banned in the game
[3529.52s -> 3531.52s]  on the fake stream.
[3531.52s -> 3536.26s]  Oh, the stream died.
[3536.26s -> 3542.19s]  What happened? I passed out?
[3542.19s -> 3550.75s]  I got banned?
[3550.75s -> 3552.75s]  Oh, well, whatever. We'll be back tomorrow.
[3552.75s -> 3554.75s]  I got six viewers though.
[3554.75s -> 3560.19s]  I'm fucking hungry.
[3560.19s -> 3572.02s]  I need to download some games tomorrow.
[3572.02s -> 3574.02s]  Alright, fucking move this goddamn thing.
[3574.02s -> 3585.09s]  There. Alright, now move this.
[3585.09s -> 3590.32s]  Much better. Get a camera?
[3590.32s -> 3593.70s]  Get a camera
[3593.70s -> 3595.70s]  and go to Zornov.
[3595.70s -> 3605.81s]  My fucking god.
[3605.81s -> 3612.40s]  I'm never gonna, my career is never gonna
[3612.40s -> 3622.70s]  take off. Hey, Princess Hotcakes,
[3622.70s -> 3625.26s]  thanks for the five community
[3625.26s -> 3629.42s]  subs.
[3629.42s -> 3631.60s]  Thanks for the five subs. I need to take a shower
[3631.60s -> 3633.60s]  too, but hold on.
[3633.60s -> 3644.85s]  Ooh, a pig. Alright, what does heat mean?
[3644.85s -> 3647.09s]  Any air conditioner? Alright, I need to
[3647.09s -> 3650.80s]  wait, download some games. How tired am I?
[3650.80s -> 3662.19s]  Okay, wait, I have energy.
[3662.19s -> 3664.19s]  I need to download steam and then I have to download a few games
[3664.19s -> 3672.26s]  so I can stream a game. 3080?
[3672.26s -> 3675.14s]  Okay, don't stream yet.
[3675.14s -> 3680.24s]  Nope.
[3680.24s -> 3682.24s]  Ooh, dude.
[3682.24s -> 3684.24s]  Somebody comes over your house.
[3684.24s -> 3686.74s]  Your mom comes over.
[3686.74s -> 3689.10s]  Your parents are over your house.
[3689.10s -> 3691.10s]  Computer turns on. That's the last thing that Mozilla saved.
[3691.10s -> 3693.92s]  And you fucking hit back wicked
[3693.92s -> 3695.92s]  quick, but they saw. They saw.
[3695.92s -> 3707.89s]  They know. Oh, I can do cryptocurrency?
[3707.89s -> 3709.89s]  I can buy houses.
[3709.89s -> 3711.89s]  Why is there so much in this game? Okay.
[3711.89s -> 3722.06s]  Apps.
[3722.06s -> 3726.42s]  Zorn, were you watching Zorn?
[3726.42s -> 3728.42s]  Zno. Zom.
[3728.42s -> 3731.42s]  Zai was not.
[3731.42s -> 3738.53s]  Okay, just download them all on Spotify.
[3738.53s -> 3740.96s]  Enhance your stream with music and sound effects.
[3740.96s -> 3743.20s]  Stream Lap.
[3743.20s -> 3745.20s]  You can see the donations and subscriptions that come in, okay.
[3745.20s -> 3747.50s]  Oh, virus scans.
[3747.50s -> 3750.77s]  Cryptocurrency Miner.
[3750.77s -> 3752.77s]  And a VPN.
[3752.77s -> 3756.21s]  Wait, what?
[3756.21s -> 3758.21s]  We're going to think we used access websites where accesses are restricted.
[3758.21s -> 3761.41s]  That's not for security purposes?
[3761.41s -> 3772.42s]  VPNs are snake oil.
[3776.06s -> 3778.06s]  Zokey. Zokey, dude.
[3778.06s -> 3782.21s]  Wait, let's watch YouTube.
[3782.21s -> 3789.95s]  What can we watch on YouTube?
[3789.95s -> 3791.95s]  I'm going to call the fucking cable company.
[3791.95s -> 3797.38s]  I have to upload a video.
[3797.38s -> 3800.58s]  I don't have any videos.
[3800.58s -> 3804.61s]  Aw, shit. Okay, I have to record videos.
[3804.61s -> 3811.39s]  Alright, where's my apps?
[3811.39s -> 3820.46s]  Come on, Steam, hurry up.
[3820.46s -> 3827.50s]  Zermacraft or Zagat.
[3827.50s -> 3830.38s]  Please take a shower.
[3830.38s -> 3835.50s]  Alright, Steam's almost ready.
[3835.50s -> 3837.50s]  I'm going to say fuck this joke.
[3837.50s -> 3840.06s]  I'm sorry. We're just having fun, man.
[3840.06s -> 3842.06s]  Alright, Steam.
[3842.06s -> 3844.37s]  TheMitcher3.
[3844.37s -> 3846.86s]  CarStryka.
[3846.86s -> 3848.86s]  Fallgang.
[3848.86s -> 3850.86s]  CyberPrank.
[3850.86s -> 3853.55s]  ThePastOfUs.
[3853.55s -> 3856.94s]  DarkSouls. Yep.
[3856.94s -> 3858.94s]  RocketSucker.
[3858.94s -> 3864.38s]  Fallgang. Alright, I can't afford anymore money.
[3864.38s -> 3866.56s]  We're going to be a DarkSouls.
[3866.56s -> 3875.58s]  Fall Guys.
[3875.58s -> 3877.58s]  And Rocket League streamer.
[3877.58s -> 3879.58s]  And we're going to preorder the
[3879.58s -> 3881.58s]  $120 CyberPunk277
[3881.58s -> 3883.58s]  Keanu Reeves Figurine Box
[3883.58s -> 3886.19s]  that has the ten
[3886.19s -> 3903.29s]  figures in it in the art book and it wastes 42 pounds! 42 pound art book that's
[3903.29s -> 3916.71s]  right. Ooh library do I have any games? No. Quite the selection on Steam. Okay
[3916.71s -> 3921.63s]  those are downloading. Okay Streamlabs. I got donations. Enter your stream key. You
[3921.63s -> 3930.64s]  don't give your stream key to Streamlabs. The streamers look very nerd.
[3930.64s -> 3951.90s]  Ban that fucking guy. Don't let him come back. Ooh scan for viruses. I got hacked
[3951.90s -> 3965.93s]  remember? Like just scan them all in. I did go to Zornhub a few times so I
[3965.93s -> 3976.03s]  wouldn't be- oh uh oh. The funniest part when you run this on somebody's computer that
[3976.03s -> 3982.18s]  doesn't know anything about computers is this looks like this and then it jumps
[3982.18s -> 3988.30s]  up to like four or five hundred in ten seconds. Doesn't look that bad until it
[3988.30s -> 3996.47s]  gets halfway through. These are also people that have probably never cleared
[3996.47s -> 4004.77s]  their cache, their temporary files, their browser history ever. You could literally
[4004.81s -> 4008.69s]  like on like your grandmother's computer you could probably see a website in her
[4008.69s -> 4018.38s]  history that she went to like in 2013. What about the other five viruses? What's
[4018.38s -> 4033.44s]  this bullshit? Scan it again. Do it again. If you're not fully clean then what's the
[4033.44s -> 4039.82s]  point? They're just gonna multiply and you're gonna get more viruses. You gotta pay
[4039.82s -> 4066.15s]  for those. You do? This computer is cleaner than you are. For now. For you. So
[4066.15s -> 4070.59s]  what happened? Did they just went away? Oh a five gigabyte hard drive. That's pretty
[4070.63s -> 4099.92s]  pathetic. What year is it? All right, spottery. Uh, is it just songs? Okay, well it's just on
[4099.92s -> 4112.10s]  there. Wallpaper! Oh yes! Like I'm on the moon. Cool. All right, I like that one.
[4112.10s -> 4126.62s]  Here's your mining stream key. All right, shut this off. I don't
[4126.62s -> 4132.18s]  want to listen to music. Tutorials. Stream, game stats, mining, internet speed. Oh wow
[4132.18s -> 4139.78s]  it's all here. Gambling? Bills? Oh, okay cool. All right, what was I doing? Oh yeah
[4139.78s -> 4145.07s]  games games games games games. Okay, we're steam. Okay, I'm still not done downloading.
[4145.07s -> 4155.62s]  How big are the downloads? What the fuck? They didn't even start. Download on C.
[4155.62s -> 4165.99s]  What do I get? 50 gigs. I want Fall Guys and Dark Souls first. Cyber Prank 2066 is
[4165.99s -> 4169.95s]  that's a huge game. I need a, I need another, I need a full hard drive to put
[4169.95s -> 4179.40s]  this on. All right, we're gonna start with Dark Souls and Fall Game. I got 200
[4179.40s -> 4188.64s]  bucks. Let those download while I use the bathroom and eat some beans. I need to go
[4188.64s -> 4205.65s]  sleep. All right, those downloads will be ready when I wake up. Nightmares? All right, we're
[4205.65s -> 4218.65s]  gonna do our first gaming stream today. Steam. Okay, still not done. Jesus. Okay,
[4218.65s -> 4222.85s]  what, how do I get faster? Internet, internet speed. If you're tired of late
[4222.85s -> 4226.13s]  loading of pages of poor quality streaming, buy a new internet package.
[4226.13s -> 4228.85s]  There's a website where you can buy an internet package. You can also buy in
[4228.85s -> 4240.91s]  daily turbo packs. I need to take a shower. I haven't taken a shower in three
[4240.91s -> 4251.52s]  days. Okay, where's that app? What's it called? Amazon. Can you buy a shower on
[4251.52s -> 4262.75s]  Amazon? You can't, right? You can't buy this big, like appliances like this. I can
[4262.75s -> 4274.19s]  buy a full shower on Amazon. I don't have enough money to do this. Bridge. I don't,
[4274.19s -> 4286.69s]  I don't have enough money for a bathtub. Where's a, what about a shower? Air
[4286.69s -> 4293.46s]  conditioner. Stands. Bed. Fireplace. Fridge. Shelf. Sofa. Bath. Toilet. Washing
[4293.46s -> 4316.46s]  machine. Go on, just zed it. How do I clean my body? VR headset? I'm gonna have
[4316.46s -> 4320.38s]  to be dirty for a little while. I can't clean myself. Go shower in the
[4320.38s -> 4328.94s]  neighbor's house. That's actually not a bad idea. I'll, I'll bring some, uh, I'll
[4328.94s -> 4349.89s]  bring an offering. Can I like spray myself with the washer fluid? I feel so
[4349.89s -> 4359.53s]  dirty. What do you think I'm trying to do? Okay, this is, this is like a rust.
[4359.53s -> 4364.94s]  That's not even, these are, this is rust. This is, this is, I'm playing on a rust
[4364.94s -> 4387.38s]  server. Hey, hey, hey. You have a bathroom? You smell disgusting. Get out of the
[4387.38s -> 4397.14s]  shower. I just ate a handful of beans with my hands in front of them. Is this
[4397.14s -> 4409.25s]  his car? I wanna, I'm not disgusting. You're disgusting. What are you talking
[4409.29s -> 4416.18s]  about? Bite with my canine into the top of the can and like cartoon around to get
[4416.18s -> 4419.10s]  the lid off and then reach in with my bare hand and eat it with the other one.
[4419.10s -> 4435.05s]  Can I play, I need some money. Almond Jerry, yeah. Okay, are these done? This is
[4435.05s -> 4439.15s]  what it felt like. Some of you guys don't know, but this is what it used to be
[4439.15s -> 4446.89s]  like. Back in like the mid 90s, most people had a 28.8k modem. Of course, if
[4446.89s -> 4451.69s]  you, if you were really, really, you were doing well, you had a 56k modem.
[4453.34s -> 4459.37s]  Some people had 128 and that was just holy shit. You mean that you can open up
[4459.37s -> 4471.57s]  your email and load all of your emails in five minutes? You could not download
[4471.57s -> 4481.67s]  anything. A 12 gigabyte download? No, no, you didn't download video games. They
[4481.67s -> 4486.62s]  came over a series of like 12 disks if they were big enough. Quick, make a World
[4486.62s -> 4493.90s]  of Warcraft joke. 2004, my graphics card couldn't handle, wow. So I had to
[4493.94s -> 4497.82s]  play on the lowest settings and it still ran at like 20 FPS. That's all, folks.
[4508.60s -> 4512.45s]  I couldn't even load the mountains in the background. I had to turn everything
[4512.45s -> 4518.50s]  down. That was a nice internet clown. Thanks, man. Hey, I'm here to please.
[4518.94s -> 4523.42s]  Internet Clown, E-Clown, German at 85. Nice to meet you. That's a good handshake
[4523.42s -> 4533.80s]  you got there. Now what do I do? All right, I need to remember you're the
[4533.80s -> 4540.78s]  Bugs Bunny of Twitch. I feel like I'm more of a Daffy. Bugs like was kind of
[4540.82s -> 4545.04s]  smart and he like outsmarted everybody. Daffy just got angry and broke things
[4545.04s -> 4550.29s]  and acted like a child and couldn't comprehend basic sentences. But he was
[4550.29s -> 4568.15s]  funny. Daffy Duck. I don't know what cartoon character. I'm sure there's some
[4568.15s -> 4575.46s]  stupid online quiz where I can determine what cartoon character I am. I'm not
[4575.46s -> 4582.79s]  Elmo. I don't have any money. I just, I'm just going to sleep. Just go back to
[4582.79s -> 4593.49s]  bed. I can't, I can sleep after an hour. Do the quiz. There are so many. Which
[4593.49s -> 4611.30s]  one? What cartoon character are you? Hold on. No, but this is so, this is not
[4611.30s -> 4618.66s]  even accurate. This is, this like, these questions are so, so just basic. I don't
[4618.66s -> 4622.25s]  even know who the, what the character pool is. Well, what's the character pool
[4622.25s -> 4627.60s]  here? It's accurate. Okay. I don't, I don't feel like capturing this right now.
[4627.60s -> 4630.54s]  I'm just going to read it. Okay. You have a free afternoon. What are you going to
[4630.54s -> 4635.54s]  do? Sing, tidy my room, go exploring, and relax, relax. You're hungry. What do you
[4635.54s -> 4641.12s]  fancy? A zebra steak, a grilled cheese sandwich, sushi, or ice cream? Hmm.
[4641.12s -> 4647.62s]  Probably grilled cheese. Zebra steak. Favorite type of weather? Snow, sun, monsoon, or
[4647.62s -> 4653.37s]  blistering heat. I love the heat. Pick a sport. Baseball. Baseball. What's your
[4653.37s -> 4662.06s]  favorite class? PE, woodwork, art, or math? I literally didn't like any of these. I
[4662.06s -> 4671.02s]  hated all these. Where's the free period? If I had to choose art. Totally random
[4671.02s -> 4674.26s]  question. How are you feeling today? Which one emoji would you choose? The sad
[4674.26s -> 4680.66s]  face? The surprised face? The heart face? Or the eating face? The eating face. Okay.
[4680.66s -> 4691.49s]  How old are you? This is asking me how old are you? And the first one is under
[4691.49s -> 4702.80s]  six. I'm the oldest 16. I'm older. If you were a sweet, what color would you be?
[4702.80s -> 4707.95s]  Yellow, red, green, or orange? I'd be green. Green apple. You've got two plane
[4707.95s -> 4714.11s]  tickets. Pick a destination. Japan, Norway, America, or Africa. I've always wanted to
[4714.11s -> 4720.46s]  go to Japan. Pick a best mate. A snowman, a spaceman, a lion, or a bunny?
[4720.46s -> 4734.53s]  Uh, a lion. Pick a hairstyle. Spiky on top, short back and sides, ponytail, or buzz
[4734.53s -> 4740.94s]  cut. What's a spiky on top? Hey, how about a song to get the party started? Thank you
[4740.94s -> 4749.78s]  next. Baby shark, wannabe, or wrecking ball? I'm gonna go with, I'm gonna go
[4749.78s -> 4762.51s]  with, uh, uh, how about, how about wrecking ball? Okay, here we go. You, hey, okay, ladies
[4762.51s -> 4770.53s]  and gentlemen, we got to see, uh, an ad. What cartoon character am I? Let's find out. This
[4770.53s -> 4781.62s]  is just a gamified ad for the, we stopped doing that, gamified ad for, uh, Detective
[4781.62s -> 4790.24s]  Pikachu. It's just a gamified ad. Oh, I'm Pikachu. And then on the bottom, I don't
[4790.32s -> 4796.27s]  know if you can see that. It says image by Detective Pikachu movie on Instagram. So,
[4796.99s -> 4808.38s]  I'm apparently Pikachu. But I get, I think all of, all of us are. Is it Pikachu? Hold
[4808.38s -> 4816.66s]  on a minute. Spiky hairstyle. Pikachu doesn't have that. Lions are your best friends. Who,
[4816.66s -> 4822.06s]  what lion is Pikachu's best friend? Is it because I picked Japan? It's like a,
[4823.23s -> 4828.96s]  originated in Japan? I picked, my favorite color was green. Yellow was an option. I didn't pick
[4828.96s -> 4839.66s]  it. I picked green. Pikachu's not green. My favorite class was art and my sport was baseball.
[4839.66s -> 4848.05s]  I loved the heat. Pikachu doesn't like the heat. It doesn't retake the quiz. No. You guys, I don't
[4848.05s -> 4855.36s]  know. Some of you new viewers might not remember this, but we did like 40, like quiz personality
[4855.36s -> 4865.47s]  tests, like three years ago. Is it time to do it again at some point? I'll set that up. All right.
[4865.47s -> 4872.37s]  All right. We're going to do that tomorrow. I'm dead serious. Tomorrow, I'm chubby. Tomorrow's
[4872.37s -> 4877.82s]  going to be a fucked up stream. We're going to do, we're doing chubby bunny. I've mined and I'll do
[4877.82s -> 4885.79s]  a bunch of fucking cartoon character personality quizzes. This is your stream tomorrow. I'll get
[4885.79s -> 4900.19s]  those set up. At least downloaded yet. Okay. Steam. What the fuck? Hurry up and download.
[4900.83s -> 4917.02s]  Tomorrow is chubby bunny. Yep. I paused it. No, I didn't. It's gone. What about my VPN?
[4917.02s -> 4924.75s]  You can change your current location by activating the VPN. What's MBTI? Those are the Myers-Briggs.
[4924.75s -> 4931.78s]  I've taken it twice. I forget what it was. The first time I took it was ENFP. The second time
[4931.78s -> 4937.04s]  I took it, it was a little different. The first time I took it, I was like 20. The second time I
[4937.04s -> 4954.53s]  took it, I, it was different. It was like, it was like E N like I J or something. ENFP is what I,
[4954.53s -> 4961.09s]  the last, the one I really remember was ENFP. Are you fucking moron? You have to leave the
[4961.09s -> 4967.74s]  download window open. All right. Let's see if this person gets banned. It gets banned for real.
[4968.56s -> 4984.30s]  8.5, 8.6. Oh man. They're right. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Might have been a, might have been a
[4984.30s -> 5008.03s]  glitch. VIP in for the day. God damn it. I'm not going to mod them. You get VIP for 15 minutes.
[5008.59s -> 5018.19s]  I don't even know their name. I just saw their text. Make him the new Jerma. Give him the stream
[5018.19s -> 5022.35s]  key. I can't believe I had to actually have the, I slept two days in a row for this shit.
[5022.99s -> 5039.44s]  It was me. I, it could be anybody. Cause I don't know. Can you get off the PC while leaving the
[5039.44s -> 5051.20s]  window open? Um, hold on. I'm about to get Dark Souls. It could be in this very room. It could even.
[5053.39s -> 5066.11s]  Oops. Dark Souls. Oh, dark walls. Dark wall. Downloaded. All right. Let's go. Dark souls.
[5066.11s -> 5079.09s]  Does the game play itself? Turn on the stream. Hold on. I want to make sure my settings work.
[5080.14s -> 5092.78s]  I'm not going to stream Dark Souls at 400 K up. You won't be able to see anything.
[5092.78s -> 5103.84s]  What are you, what is this? This is Dark Souls. No, no, no. This is, this is what you get when you
[5103.84s -> 5109.12s]  torrent Dark Souls. This is what happens when you get the wrong torrent and then you go,
[5109.12s -> 5116.46s]  what is this? Oh no. What did I download? It's supposed to be Dark Souls and oh, I'm in trouble
[5116.46s -> 5123.44s]  now. I got to clean my computer. I got to reinstall windows. Am I about to beat the game?
[5130.85s -> 5135.25s]  All right. Hold on. Wait. I got to stream this. I have to stream. I got to have real reactions.
[5135.25s -> 5138.93s]  All right. Let's do it. Let's stream. Let's go. All right. I'm going to, I'm going to beat Dark
[5138.93s -> 5159.97s]  Souls on stream. On stream. You understand? Okay. Game. 700 upload. Shitty quality, but it's okay.
[5159.97s -> 5180.77s]  How do I cap show? Save the stream. No, I can't. Okay. Here we go. Stream going. Donation. Oh,
[5180.77s -> 5191.50s]  where's my stream labs? Hey, somebody subscribed. Thanks. What's up? Yeah. I'm just checking out
[5191.50s -> 5198.75s]  Dark Souls. I will subscribe to you with a credit card that I stole. Uh, don't do that. Checking out
[5198.75s -> 5205.31s]  Dark Souls for the first time guys. Welcome. You got chips and cola. Nice dude. What the fuck was
[5205.31s -> 5216.18s]  that? I just hear a, I think the 18 plus category should be added here. I'm looking for my favorite
[5216.18s -> 5225.20s]  streamer. Well, yeah, just hold on. Just wait, dude. I can mod them? Press the F key to ban.
[5225.84s -> 5236.13s]  Oh, that guy was looking for a favorite streamer. I'm not a sub. I'm using ad block. I don't send
[5236.13s -> 5245.28s]  donate. I watch for free. You're obese. Sorry. Spam, spam, spam. Shut up. Hey, can I reach you?
[5245.28s -> 5250.99s]  Yes. What are you, what can you do? What can I do for you? There's 12 people watching. Holy shit.
[5250.99s -> 5264.24s]  I gotta play. I will. Hey, don't fucking do that. How? What? Why? Why would you do that to me?
[5265.18s -> 5278.16s]  Bad stream. No, ban these people. I need a mod. Do not ever ban me. It's not a bad stream. Just
[5278.16s -> 5290.06s]  wait. I'm going to be dark souls on stream. I want to be a streamer too, but the blender refused my
[5290.06s -> 5302.35s]  application. I gotta get 400 live viewers. Fuck. Okay. Can I do, why does this feel like a real
[5302.35s -> 5319.66s]  stream? Oh my God. I'm so bad at this. So don't fucking hack me again. I just ran a virus scan.
[5322.00s -> 5329.92s]  Thank you. Jay1299552 for the sub. I appreciate it. I'm currently getting hacked right now.
[5333.34s -> 5348.16s]  Uh, you've been hacked. You are king. Thanks for the subs. Wait, where's my other, one viewer says
[5348.16s -> 5353.02s]  he's imitating another streamer. Whatever. All right. Get it off the screen. I can't see.
[5353.82s -> 5364.46s]  Don't show the IP by mistake. It's a single player cereal box game. Suggest a good TV show. Uh,
[5364.46s -> 5369.49s]  the boys. I'm watching the boys right now. It's pretty good. The boys is a pretty good show.
[5369.49s -> 5374.56s]  Really? I've just, season two is pretty crazy. I think you can be, I think you can be a good game.
[5374.56s -> 5385.60s]  Shut up. I have to beat this. I mean that in a very nice way. I closed the stream. No! Right
[5385.60s -> 5394.06s]  when I beat the level, Esports are ready. Can I save it and I will pick up tomorrow and I'll
[5394.06s -> 5406.98s]  continue my Dark Souls playthrough? Okay. I'm going to save it here. How many, I made some money.
[5406.98s -> 5411.86s]  Holy shit. I made 17 bucks. Never sub, never donated, ad block on, stolen laptop. Okay. Thanks
[5411.86s -> 5418.46s]  for the 17 bucks. That doesn't make any sense. Never subbed, never donated, ad block on. Okay.
[5418.46s -> 5437.10s]  Thanks for the $17. Pog, I made my coffee and I, thank you. I, how much money? That's pretty good.
[5437.10s -> 5448.72s]  I have a different, wait, get paid. If the incoming donates are over the $10, we instantly
[5448.72s -> 5459.49s]  transfer you to bank. Today, total donation, total account is $35.08. Thank you. I want a different
[5459.49s -> 5471.26s]  sound than the doot to do. Minus the $200 from hacking. I have to pay attention when the hack
[5471.26s -> 5476.64s]  happens. All right. Now I leave my cam on and accidentally keep it on while I sleep.
[5477.28s -> 5482.30s]  And I'll make way more money for some weird reason. Oh, I forgot to put the music on.
[5482.86s -> 5491.60s]  All right. I'm going to continue my Dark Souls playthrough tomorrow. You need the VPN.
[5499.23s -> 5504.99s]  No, didn't never sub, never donated. Except for right now, I gave more money than anyone has the
[5504.99s -> 5517.42s]  whole time you've been streaming. I need air, I need air conditioning. This dude left his cam on
[5517.42s -> 5521.74s]  and ate two cans of beans off the floor. All right. Let's go. I don't got any time to waste.
[5521.74s -> 5528.14s]  We're going to continue our playthrough. I'm coming back. Hey, you got to be, I'm going to
[5528.14s -> 5537.87s]  be consistent. It's me. I got 25 followers. Let's go. Ooh, what happened? Thanks for the sub.
[5545.26s -> 5551.78s]  I'm paying for this internet. Entertain me. That's what I'm doing. Who just came in? Hey,
[5551.78s -> 5556.34s]  thank you. Oof. Even though there are publications that I don't like, it's generally good. Sure.
[5556.34s -> 5562.19s]  Whatever. I don't know. I have no idea what that means. Where do you live? I live in Las Vegas.
[5562.19s -> 5592.46s]  Continuing my playthrough of Dark Souls. Streaming is going well. Yeah, it's going pretty good.
[5592.46s -> 5600.99s]  Someone is advertising. Ban them. What do you want me to do? Watching stream while eating plus
[5600.99s -> 5623.82s]  one. Do not ever ban me. Hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What the fuck? KeckW. All right,
[5623.82s -> 5628.06s]  who is it? Somebody's going crazy here. Support. They subbed. Hey, thanks for the sub. This is,
[5628.06s -> 5634.26s]  all right. Those of you that are wondering, this is a great example of why I do not read
[5634.26s -> 5640.77s]  subs and donations really on stream. This is why. If you want a perfect example,
[5640.77s -> 5649.30s]  someone's advertising. Talk about his mother? No. All right, whatever I did. You never read
[5649.30s -> 5656.88s]  anything. Yeah, but I'm just saying. Hey, thanks. Wow, what am I doing? Dark Souls. Oh, hey. I
[5656.88s -> 5659.68s]  didn't like you before, but now it's fine. Hey, thanks. Thanks for the dollar. Okay, bye.
[5660.56s -> 5674.18s]  Dark Souls. Nice, nice. Pretty hard. Pretty hard part. I didn't get the, oh, I got to get the coin
[5674.18s -> 5693.36s]  in the middle. Fuck. Wait. Fuck. Why am I trying to entertain these people? They're not real.
[5694.00s -> 5712.13s]  Got it. I'm trying to entertain a fake audience. I bought chips and cola. All right. Hey, whoever
[5712.13s -> 5723.06s]  that was. Thanks. How do I get down here? That's how. Oh shit. I feel so dirty. You got to go quick.
[5725.97s -> 5733.94s]  Fuck. Stop. Just leave me alone. Leap. The streamer is bored. Hey, hey, hey. This is very,
[5733.94s -> 5739.22s]  very nerd. I'm your sub. Thanks for the sub. Hey, mouse a lot action. Thanks for the subscription.

[5746.18s -> 5754.37s]  name and say I love her? Sure. Uh, talk about your mother. Hey, listen. Thanks for the subscription.
[5754.37s -> 5759.41s]  Appreciate that. Uh, hey, have a good, have a good afternoon. You and your loved one.
[5759.97s -> 5764.45s]  Steemolotology. Thanks for the $7.08. I'm sending you the last money on my card. What are you doing,
[5764.45s -> 5770.19s]  man? Are you crazy? Hey, thanks for the $3.08. I made my coffee and I came here. Hey, thanks a
[5770.19s -> 5784.46s]  lot, man. Appreciate it. This is getting meta. I just have to beat this fucking level. How many,
[5784.46s -> 5794.29s]  how many people are watching? Am I even streaming anymore? Oh, fuck. Turn the stream back on. This
[5794.29s -> 5802.48s]  is a hard level. All right. I'll get back at it tomorrow. No progress. Omega low. No progress.
[5806.29s -> 5816.85s]  What does this mean? Oh, I have, I can level up, right? I can, I have a skill tree. Streamer skills.
[5818.32s -> 5822.40s]  Okay. Learn this one. I have an extra slot in my backpack. Oh my goodness. What do we got now?
[5823.04s -> 5827.57s]  Increase the number of miners you can buy. That's a crypto thing. Garbage motivation
[5827.57s -> 5835.98s]  decreases more slowly. Uh, increases your zoo tube video upload limit. I don't have enough money for
[5835.98s -> 5852.40s]  this. I'm so tired. All right. Hold on. What's wrong with me? That didn't sound good. I'm like
[5852.40s -> 5864.51s]  dying. I'm like sick because I won't take a shower and I won't sleep. Why can't I sleep? How do I
[5864.51s -> 5872.67s]  take medicine? Get paid out from Streamlabs. Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Right, right, right.
[5872.67s -> 5885.86s]  Where's my Streamlabs? 45 bucks. Let's go. All right. How much money do I have? Where's my bank?
[5891.33s -> 5898.05s]  Total money owed. All right. Send all money to credit card. All right. I got a hundred total
[5898.05s -> 5912.62s]  money owed. Okay. I got $163. Bill Corp. You have a new bill that you have to pay. Oh shit. All right.
[5912.62s -> 5922.48s]  Hold on. I gotta, I gotta make some money. I need to get a job. Waste job. This is a job thing,
[5922.48s -> 5933.71s]  right? Workers. Job King. Just gamble. That's blackjack. Easy money. Don't tell me that. I
[5933.71s -> 5940.75s]  have $85 in my account. You don't tell somebody with 80 bucks to their name that blackjack get
[5940.75s -> 5947.98s]  money. That's horrible. Why are you telling me that? Okay. Cashier, taxi driver, courier,
[5947.98s -> 5953.20s]  Uber driver, waiter. We're going to be waiter. We'll get tips. We'll send you a message three
[5953.20s -> 5958.10s]  hours before the job. Let's go to work. Waiter. I used to do this, you know? I was a waiter.
[5958.74s -> 5965.63s]  I need to take a shower before I go to work. I wouldn't want to be waited by this guy.
[5965.63s -> 5978.72s]  I have probably have stink lines following me around. I'm going to get thrown out.
[5978.72s -> 5985.60s]  I'm going to walk in. Oh, come on, dude. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. You've done this three

[8286.72s -> 8293.42s]  garbage. Be arrogant about it. I'm paying for this internet. Entertain me. I love these streams.
[8293.42s -> 8299.71s]  Thanks. Is there a lottery on this channel? I, sometimes I do a lottery. Depends on, uh,

[8401.86s -> 8410.22s]  so I can do some high quality food. Being a hundred percent with you. I made that doot doot
[8410.22s -> 8418.54s]  sound and I uploaded it in 2015. I mean, what do you mean? Okay. Burrito, clam soup. I need
[8418.54s -> 8426.83s]  something way better than that. I need like a seven star meal. By the way, seven stars.
[8427.39s -> 8435.52s]  What kind of rating system is that? Seven out of seven. All right. We're just going to get the,
[8435.52s -> 8440.80s]  this thing up here. Burritos is probably the best. I'm going to get two burritos.
[8447.44s -> 8463.44s]  Dog. The dog food is six stars. Oh, I should set an alarm. Okay. We're going to set an alarm for,
[8464.78s -> 8480.96s]  um, 10. So we don't sleep through work. Okay. That's my food. Get it. Goo goo gaga. Oh shit.

[8488.21s -> 8501.12s]  pay this guy to pee. Shit. Just get rich as fuck. What do you think I'm doing? I'm trying.
[8501.12s -> 8516.69s]  Let's pee down the drain. All right. I'll sleep and I'll pee somewhere in the morning. What's up
[8516.69s -> 8521.17s]  with, hold on. Let me read this. What's up with Jerma today? He started streaming today. It was
[8521.25s -> 8524.61s]  marked as Dark Souls, but he was just playing impossible games. Chat was incredibly slow.
[8524.61s -> 8528.77s]  Most of the people called him obese and advertised their own channel for some reason. No mods.
[8528.77s -> 8532.45s]  But the worst fucking thing is that I donated and asked him to say hello to my loved one and
[8532.45s -> 8541.55s]  he just insulted my mother. Anyone knows what's going on with him lately? Um, quite a lot,
[8541.55s -> 8552.43s]  as you can see. Omega lol. Oh my God. Omega lol real. All right. Send money to the card. Wait,
[8552.43s -> 8560.05s]  any money on my wallet? I don't have any money in my wallet. I can't pee. I can shit at work.
[8560.77s -> 8566.72s]  I can just pee at work. I always go to the bathroom at work. It's fine. I need gas.
[8567.36s -> 8586.80s]  I have to pay for that service. How much is it? Oh, I'll take an Uber. Set the destination where
[8586.80s -> 8598.46s]  you want to go. I can't take an Uber to work. I can't walk to work. I know why I gotta go.
[8599.90s -> 8608.27s]  Stop. I know I have to work. Leave me alone. Job king. Your waiter job starts. You're ready.
[8608.27s -> 8618.29s]  I know, I know, I know, I know. Take the bus. Can you? Wait, can I take taxi? Walk, dude.
[8636.56s -> 8651.71s]  I gotta ditch work and stream. Hey, surprise stream today. This motherfucker's got it out for
[8651.71s -> 8666.66s]  me, huh? Uh-huh. F-O-M-D. Blocked. This is by Lucas. The same Lucas. Leave me alone.

[8690.03s -> 8693.31s]  Someone on chat, do you ever get bored? I'm trying to turn the music on. Shut up.
[8693.87s -> 8707.26s]  Okay. Hey, what's going on guys? Just chilling today. I get bored while streaming.
[8709.90s -> 8713.10s]  Sometimes it can be, but I like to try to be as cool as I can.
[8714.14s -> 8720.02s]  Just chilling. Hey, somebody just gave some money. Thanks a lot, man. What movie you like?
[8720.99s -> 8728.82s]  Um, I love, I'm big, I'm really into pornography. It's my favorite movie genre. Hey, thanks a lot,

[8768.19s -> 8775.89s]  We're going sub only. Does donating support you better or subscribe? Well, that's up to you.
[8775.89s -> 8782.67s]  Stop fighting each other. Stop, why is it just fighting? What language does it do you speak?
[8782.67s -> 8787.17s]  Well, I speak English. It's what I'm speaking right now. Does donating support you better?
[8787.17s -> 8796.82s]  It's up to you, man. Let's do whatever we feel. Fucking stop fighting. Hey, uh, tick girl,
[8796.82s -> 8801.52s]  thanks for the sub. Vin Petro, four dollars and five cents. Appreciate it. We're just, uh,

[8824.38s -> 8829.23s]  Thanks for the sub, though. Thanks for the three bucks. Thanks for the three bucks.
[8829.79s -> 8835.57s]  Thanks for the sub, too. A lot of, a lot of subs today. Good morning. Hey, good morning. Uh,
[8836.29s -> 8842.62s]  speak from your past. Let's talk about the future. Probably gonna see Jerma Rumble live
[8842.62s -> 8847.15s]  on Twitch eventually at some point in the next couple of years. What song we got going on here?
[8847.15s -> 8854.86s]  Let's change the music a little. Uh, how about, uh, I want to be a little chill. We'll talk about
[8854.86s -> 8862.61s]  my past. One time I shit my mother's bed. I think I play a lot more talent. I think I'm more talented
[8862.61s -> 8869.66s]  than you in Fortnite. That's all good, man. I don't play Fortnite that often, so pull that out a
[8869.66s -> 8873.89s]  little. All right, guys. That's an, uh, I'll see you guys later. That's, uh, that's it.
[8877.57s -> 8892.99s]  I got the same stream title for like two months. Dude. All right. I got 60 bucks. He said, well,
[8892.99s -> 8901.06s]  it does say aces only. I don't even have Counter-Strike installed. Okay. I don't have
[8901.62s -> 8911.02s]  Counter-Strike. Why? I'm not even playing that game. Oh, rocket soccer. Okay. Let's uninstall,
[8911.02s -> 8924.40s]  uh, Fall Guys. Fall Guys sucks. How do I uninstall Fall Guys? You must choose the disc.
[8924.40s -> 8931.07s]  I want it on C, but I know no free space. How do I get it off? Uninstall it. I can't uninstall
[8931.07s -> 8935.47s]  the game. I need another hard drive. Are you kidding me? Well, I made some money though.
[8935.47s -> 8946.88s]  That's pretty good. Let's see. I got 145 bucks. That's enough of me to fill the gas with, fill,
[8946.88s -> 8959.07s]  add gas to the car, go to work. I'm going to go to work today. Oh, I got two, uh, gamer points.
[8959.07s -> 8972.26s]  Let's see what they do. Shit. I have, can I upload videos? Did I record any videos?
[8972.82s -> 8987.44s]  Zootube. I could get like ad revenue. A new coffee pasta, new coffee pasta. All right. Upload.
[8988.98s -> 8994.21s]  I don't have any recorded videos. I'm so tired. All right. I gotta, I get to start recording.
[8994.85s -> 9012.42s]  I'm doing all right. Let's go to sleep. Okay. Now I, I'm, I'm okay with food. I need to go
[9012.42s -> 9016.50s]  to the bathroom. Then I'm, I'm going to pay this guy, which is stupid to pay 10 bucks to use the
[9016.50s -> 9025.14s]  bathroom, but I'm going to do it. I don't have money in my wallet. I go to my, what are you doing?
[9026.38s -> 9033.07s]  What are the ATM? All right. Well, whatever. I'll just, I'll pee. I can't wait to have like
[9033.07s -> 9035.31s]  thousands of dollars in my bank account. It's going to be sick. All right, let's go.
[9035.87s -> 9046.88s]  All right. So how much, I have 25% gas. I probably should fill it up more.
[9047.60s -> 9054.72s]  Where's the actual gas station around here? It's probably one in town, right?
[9057.66s -> 9062.62s]  Are you going to play this all night? I gotta be real honest with you.
[9063.42s -> 9069.82s]  Probably. I was going to play Exanima. Exanima was the backup, but
[9070.62s -> 9076.27s]  I don't think we even need a backup. I'm, I'm kind of like completely engaged right now.
[9076.91s -> 9095.22s]  No, don't go back to the house. It'd be dumb. Don't break the car. I just saw the
[9095.22s -> 9105.34s]  mini map thing, the tool tip pop up and I was like, Oh, I go that way. Exanima is actually
[9105.34s -> 9115.28s]  awesome. Apparently it's changed a lot since last time I played it. All right. We need a real gas
[9115.28s -> 9119.78s]  station here though. I hope there's one here so I don't break down again and have to pay 80 bucks
[9119.78s -> 9131.54s]  to fill the tank. Internet cafe simulator. Was that another game that this person made?
[9132.34s -> 9145.39s]  It has to be. No, I've seen that. I've seen that before. I've seen it on steam. Okay. I need a,
[9145.39s -> 9155.79s]  I need gas. Bad. Like right now. Turn the car off. I need to go get gas before work. Where's
[9155.79s -> 9169.66s]  there a gas station? Okay. Gas. This one right up here. All right. Straight ahead. I'm out of gas.
[9169.66s -> 9177.22s]  I'm out of gas. I'm out of gas. I'm out of gas. I'm out of gas. Please. I'm out of gas. No,
[9177.22s -> 9196.53s]  I'm not out of gas. Oh, I just barely made it. Jesus, man. This is so expensive. How much money
[9196.53s -> 9203.60s]  do I even have? All right. You don't have enough money in your wallet. Wallet? Just go to work.
[9204.32s -> 9219.55s]  I've got work in 20 minutes. Let's go. That's the kiss door. I'm not going in there.
[9223.30s -> 9227.30s]  Just live downtown. Can you add forehead at that end of that sentence, please?
[9227.78s -> 9244.30s]  I think I have the superpowers, I think. 136 bucks. Let's fill that tank. That should be in
[9244.30s -> 9253.33s]  my wallet, right? I just got paid. Yeah. All right. Fill this tank up. I don't want to get
[9253.33s -> 9275.31s]  gas ever again for this damn car. Let's go with half tank. Okay. That's going to get us a pretty
[9275.31s -> 9290.59s]  long ways. Open. Okay. Hold on. Go to the club. No, not this shit again. That guy just ran into
[9290.59s -> 9316.96s]  a school bus. So did you? No, the school bus ran into me. Is this illegal? Is it nudity in this
[9316.96s -> 9324.02s]  game? Hide screen quick. All right. Let me see if there's nudity. Is there nudity here?
[9334.67s -> 9367.68s]  Maybe you're a fire. This is lap dance area. I got to leave. That's fine. It's fine. It's
[9368.72s -> 9382.86s]  kind of resident sleeper in here, I'll be honest. React. React. Oh, sure. Okay.
[9382.86s -> 9392.82s]  Okay. Whoa, what's in there? Oh, I think there might be naked girls in there. No way, dude.
[9393.62s -> 9430.50s]  What's your naked girls? That was my mom? No, it wasn't. Go to work. Oh, shit. I forgot about
[9430.50s -> 9446.80s]  work. What time is it? No, I have to sleep, dude. No. You were at work. Yeah, I just was at work.
[9446.80s -> 9467.34s]  And then I went into that fucking snooze club. I mean, no one was even dressed up as tracer in
[9467.34s -> 9490.02s]  there. I don't like it. Don't hit this guy. Okay, I gotta go to sleep. And I'm very hungry. I need
[9490.02s -> 9507.63s]  a fridge and it's hot in here. How many complaints a minute can I do? You haven't shit in two weeks.
[9509.20s -> 9514.66s]  As it happens when you eat candy every single day for every meal, it kind of bunches you up a
[9514.66s -> 9528.62s]  little. What should you get from McDonald's? Hey, my order. Get the German 985. Don't say I'll take
[9528.62s -> 9533.57s]  the German 985 because they have no idea what the fuck you're talking about. That's two McChickens
[9533.57s -> 9537.97s]  with a little bit of mayo. Oh, sorry. Can't order that. Those don't exist anymore. Don't get the
[9537.97s -> 9548.96s]  spicy ones. They're not that good. It's a Big Mac. Sure. Get that. I'm too pissed off that they got
[9548.96s -> 9553.12s]  rid of McChickens to continue doing that little bit I was doing there. Maybe I should get a bucket
[9553.12s -> 9571.25s]  of mushrooms. Nachos. Octopus balls. Sounds good to me. No, they didn't. Yes, they did. There's no
[9571.25s -> 9584.08s]  regular McChicken anymore. It's only spicy McChicken. They don't have them. Yes, there is.
[9584.08s -> 9592.05s]  How come I can't get them? Spicy is better though. You're stupid. Wrong. I ate one today. They must
[9592.05s -> 9615.39s]  have been at a stock for like a month. I'm telling you. I tried. I don't hate the spicy McChicken.
[9615.39s -> 9625.86s]  Yes, I will. Spicy. Everything has to have spicy. Spicy McChicken. Spicy Big Mac. Spicy
[9627.38s -> 9632.91s]  soda. You put spicy in front of something. Apparently, it sells. I don't know why.
[9632.91s -> 9641.28s]  You know what? What's the difference between spicy McChicken and regular McChicken?
[9641.28s -> 9659.31s]  The spicy McChicken makes your nose run. That's it. I can open cases. Shut up, wanker.
[9660.27s -> 9676.94s]  Dude, let's open a case. CSGO case. Oh my god. Am I going to get the knife? Come on. Do it.
[9679.18s -> 9694.06s]  I just made some money. Dude, a green Mac 10. That sucks. It's not even purple.
[9694.06s -> 9705.07s]  I got mail. I got email. Do that on stream. I would rather you pull out every hair on my body
[9705.63s -> 9711.55s]  individually with a pair of tweezers over the course of a few hours than me to do an open CSGO
[9711.55s -> 9728.66s]  box stream. I would rather do that. Blender payment. I don't want to do that. I've done
[9728.66s -> 9735.06s]  that before a couple of times with TF2. Open them in crates. I don't like it. I don't want to do that.
[9735.06s -> 9743.06s]  Oh my god. Leave me alone. Open the crates for YouTube. Holy shit. That's genius, actually.
[9746.02s -> 9757.28s]  V-T-O. It's Lucas again. Yes, like clockwork, Lucas tries to hack my computer every three days.
[9757.28s -> 9772.46s]  I feel like it's automated at this point. He's just checking to see if he's using that password
[9773.26s -> 9804.34s]  anywhere else. I gotta go to work. All right. New rule. I'm not going to do any gambling until
[9804.34s -> 9808.85s]  I have at least 500 bucks and then I'm probably going to go all in on one hand. Wait, do I have
[9808.85s -> 9816.70s]  any parts I can sell? Oh, sell the beans to that guy. Wait, can I just go rob my friend's house?
[9816.70s -> 9842.82s]  He had a bunch of computer parts. Yeah. What happened to the beans? I put them in the trunk?
[9842.82s -> 9854.64s]  I didn't put them in my backpack? I swear to god. He in the grass? I don't think that's going to
[9854.64s -> 9865.39s]  work, man. Three bucks. All right. I'm not going to bargain for this. Of course I am.
[9866.11s -> 9874.37s]  Inspired beans. Of course I'll take $10 for that one. An extra 50 cents. Whatever. Give me that
[9874.37s -> 9889.94s]  money. Enough for food. I'm kind of obsessed with this game. I don't know why. Something about it.
[9889.94s -> 9907.92s]  There's like scratch tickets. There's blackjack. There's streaming. All right. What time is it?
[9907.92s -> 9914.16s]  I have to pay bills. What happens if you don't pay the bills? All right. I got 100 bucks.
[9914.88s -> 9921.20s]  Let's go to work. I've missed work, but it's okay. Lifetime weight change. I lost one pound.
[9921.76s -> 9930.13s]  Calories over the course of your whole life. I've only consumed 6,666 calories over the course of
[9930.13s -> 9939.04s]  a month. This is not in the game yet. All right. Let's go. I don't know. Let's go explore for a
[9939.04s -> 9948.18s]  little bit. No, no, no. Stream. I got streaming. What am I doing? This is streamer simulator.
[9952.77s -> 9956.53s]  I got plenty of energy. Let's go. We're doing a big 24 hour stream right now.
[9956.53s -> 9977.07s]  I'm beating Dark Souls on stream today. Let's go. What's up, guys? Today's the day. Dark Souls is
[9977.07s -> 9993.47s]  going to get completed on stream. Finally going to beat it. Favorite emote? Lul. I didn't like
[9993.47s -> 10012.05s]  that apparently. Fuck all of you. Oop. Somebody gave some money. There should be an 18 plus
[10012.05s -> 10030.72s]  category. All right. Sure. Fine. Oh, no. I went the wrong way. You're a king. There's some more
[10030.72s -> 10037.25s]  money. All right. I got to turn Spotify on. There. That's going to bring in the viewers.
[10037.97s -> 10041.94s]  How can I reach you? I have to ask you something. I don't want you to reach me.
[10056.54s -> 10068.35s]  I don't know who this guy is. Leave me alone. 38 viewers. I've got to get to 100 followers.
[10068.91s -> 10085.12s]  How am I supposed to get through this though? It seems impossible. It's not possible to do this.
[10085.12s -> 10098.42s]  Someone says they know where you live. Okay. Whatever. There's a definite bot user. I opened
[10098.42s -> 10110.32s]  a broadcast and it was not watched. This is weird. Fuck this stream. Can I just leave through
[10110.32s -> 10123.92s]  anywhere? I don't even know. Somebody's got collateral. Someone in chat insults those who
[10123.92s -> 10136.26s]  subscribe. Ban his whole family. Okay. We've banned his entire family. That's loud. I'm getting a lot
[10136.26s -> 10149.55s]  of donations this stream. I'm doing pretty good, I think. Honestly, I don't think I can beat this
[10149.55s -> 10171.54s]  level. How do I do this part? You can't beat this part. Green spots. Yeah. I got to go to that one,
[10171.54s -> 10185.26s]  but I can't even go past here. Go in the corner. Oh, fuck. Okay. What about... All right. I'll use
[10185.26s -> 10199.90s]  the... Thanks for the tip. How much money do we make? Cry. Cry. Cry. You guys have said that before.
[10199.90s -> 10207.60s]  You guys have done that. 66 bucks. Let's go. What if I turn the stream on and just leave the desk
[10207.60s -> 10228.13s]  and go to bed? Do it. Cry. Oh, I got to move this shit over. Cry. Cry. Cry. I got to get a webcam,
[10228.13s -> 10243.33s]  you're right. No more gambling. No gambling. I'm serious. No more $50 scratch tickets. I got to
[10243.33s -> 10250.70s]  get to over a thousand bucks. And hold on. I got to pay bills. Wait a second. This is bad.
[10251.26s -> 10267.87s]  Don't do it. Please go take a shit. I'm fine. Okay. We need to go to the bank. No, no, no, no,
[10267.87s -> 10271.47s]  no, no, no. I need to go to the bills app. I'm going to... Speaking of going to the bathroom,
[10271.47s -> 10285.79s]  I have to go to the bathroom right now. I have to do taxes too? Oh, man. I've got to do taxes.
[10289.68s -> 10302.26s]  Today, zero dollars. Pay it. Okay. Electricity bill. What? Electricity bill due date of this
[10302.26s -> 10312.45s]  penalty. Electricity bill. Fuck. It's taken all my money. I had to have the 200 bucks.
[10313.09s -> 10329.57s]  What about taxes? Didn't I just pay taxes? I'm hungry. I'll order something. Hold on.
[10332.69s -> 10341.10s]  2020. Taxes. Just like in real life. Due taxes. Total unrecorded money. Tax rate. We will send
[10341.10s -> 10345.50s]  your current tax to you as an invoice every four days. I have to pay taxes every four days?
[10346.22s -> 10355.46s]  Tax rate. What's this? Value added tax. What is that? I have 9% tax rate, but I have to...
[10355.46s -> 10362.37s]  What's this value added tax? 4%. Don't companies pay that? Isn't that like a company thing?
[10362.53s -> 10372.96s]  Why is it an individual thing? It's an EU thing. But I thought like companies paid this.
[10373.60s -> 10383.86s]  Why do I have to pay that? Companies don't pay shit. What's up? Excuse me. By the way,
[10383.86s -> 10393.41s]  what's going on with that, by the way? Go to work. I'm going to work. By the way, 120 hertz. Thank
[10393.41s -> 10405.73s]  you. 1080 monitor. Is that some kind of currency thing? No. No work stream. I'm beating Dark Souls
[10405.73s -> 10420.93s]  today, guys. He's still at 144p quality. Yeah, and I still pull in the fucking big numbers.
[10421.41s -> 10433.34s]  My stream toxicity is at 120%. Why? What are these? Oh, I have 26 subs. Cool. That's way over the
[10433.34s -> 10442.46s]  limit. All right, guys. I have to be nice now. That's not accurate. You guys are calm. The mood
[10442.46s -> 10447.26s]  of the stream. Let's just chill. Chill. Chill. Everybody chill. Let's get that number down.
[10447.26s -> 10460.98s]  Nice with the money. Everybody relax. We're just chilling today. Why is that toxic? I hate all of
[10460.98s -> 10472.06s]  you stupid nerds. I reported your stream. Why? Why are we so toxic? Everybody fucking relax.
[10472.94s -> 10477.28s]  It's boring. This stream is boring. I have two dollars. I cannot be a sub if I find money.
[10477.28s -> 10489.18s]  Why is everybody like this right now? The toxicity is too high. How do I calm everybody down? I need
[10489.18s -> 10500.96s]  more viewers. I only have 30. What happened? Good morning. Legend is back. I'm losing viewers.
[10504.74s -> 10510.99s]  25? That's it? I'm gonna do something crazy. Oh, no. We're good. We're good. We're good. We're good.
[10510.99s -> 10517.60s]  Play music. Wait. Hold on. I'm trying to beat the game. Okay. Hold on. I'll get... Let's get...
[10517.60s -> 10525.73s]  I know. Wait. Wait. I know I'm supposed to beat this, but hold on. Oh, shit. My tax rate.
[10526.53s -> 10537.60s]  I don't want you guys to see that. Hey, I know how much you guys love this shit.
[10537.60s -> 10546.96s]  We're gonna open some cases on stream. Oh, people like that one, don't they? I got a really slow
[10546.96s -> 10554.62s]  connection. 27 bucks. I cannot watch this stream, but I leave my support. Thank you very much. Thank
[10554.62s -> 10561.50s]  you, too. Thank all of you. I'm an idiot because I sent money. No, you're not. Cry. Cry. 10 out of
[10561.50s -> 10565.34s]  6. I don't know what that means. Thanks for the 10. Oh, thanks for the money. Just read them all
[10565.34s -> 10569.02s]  quickly. Read. Read. Read. Read. Read. Read. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

[10572.30s -> 10575.90s]  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Here we go. Case opening.
[10578.59s -> 10587.07s]  Do not ban me. All right. Just minimize this. I got 78 people here, man. Come on. No,
[10587.07s -> 10595.70s]  minimize this. Okay. We're gonna open a super case today, guys. This is 50 bucks. We're looking for
[10595.70s -> 10609.30s]  blue. Come on. Give me that knife. Oh, too bad. Too bad. Too bad. Too bad. Dang. Oh, whoa. Thanks
[10609.30s -> 10618.94s]  to the subs, guys. I opened one case. Oh, offline subs. Pug. I've opened one case and end this
[10618.94s -> 10629.90s]  stream. I made it. How much money did I make? Seven. How is it 17 bucks? It's because Twitch
[10629.90s -> 10641.79s]  took 70. Twitch is taking 70. It's not Twitch. You spent it on cases. No, but that was... They
[10641.79s -> 10647.09s]  take... Didn't it say they take 70%? I didn't see what it was. Somebody tell me. Quick. Quick. Quick.
[10647.09s -> 10661.30s]  I didn't see. I didn't see. Somebody please. It's like a 10 second... Now he's just fucking with me.
[10672.46s -> 10678.88s]  Oh, my goodness. I don't have food. All right. I'm gonna go on a food shopping. I need a fridge.
[10678.88s -> 10692.96s]  I'm obsessed with this game. I can't stop. I'm gonna buy... I need a fridge. It's stressful.
[10695.62s -> 10699.30s]  If the donation's over 10, it goes to your bank automatically. Oh, okay. Yeah, but didn't it say
[10699.30s -> 10705.20s]  that they take 70, 80% of the money? It said that on the thing we were looking at, didn't it?
[10705.20s -> 10721.81s]  In the very beginning? That's for subs. Oh. Let's get three burritos. Why don't I go... I just eat
[10721.81s -> 10743.50s]  burritos and donuts and canned mealworms. Why can't I go to the grocery store? Waiting for the food.
[10743.98s -> 10751.38s]  I gotta pee so bad. All right. Let me pee. I'll be right back. Gonna eat this and pee. And I'll sleep.
[10752.10s -> 10763.02s]  Okay. How long does this last? What was it? Last storage on this thing. I just put burritos in my
[10763.02s -> 10770.90s]  backpack. They're fresh. Okay. It's probably fresh for a couple days. I would assume, right?
[10771.62s -> 10780.70s]  High genes. All right. Let's shower. Get some rest. All right. And I'll be right back. I have to
[10780.70s -> 10989.07s]  actually pee in real life. Be right back. Okay. It's hot in this room. It's hot in here.
[10990.35s -> 10999.14s]  Fuck Vegas. I'm moving. I'm out of here. It's too hot. I actually love it like this. I'm a
[10999.14s -> 11012.40s]  weirdo. I'm one of those insane people that really actually truly enjoys hot, hot, 100 plus degree
[11012.40s -> 11025.68s]  weather. Let's go back. What are we doing? What the fuck are these mods doing? The whole chat?
[11025.68s -> 11044.27s]  Is something wrong with it? Next game, please. No. Sorry. What's the toxicity of this chat? Yeah,
[11044.27s -> 11053.84s]  I wonder. 40? Maybe 30? 40%? I need a better microphone too. I need more money. I need
[11053.84s -> 11063.97s]  everything. Chubby bunny waiting room. It's happening tomorrow. You want your real fuckface
[11063.97s -> 11070.32s]  stream? It's going to be tomorrow afternoon. I sweated. This place is hot. It is. I like it
[11070.32s -> 11088.35s]  though. A billboard? Wait, can I advertise my stream on a billboard? What time are you going
[11088.35s -> 11102.27s]  to stream EU tomorrow? Probably around like 2 PM Pacific. That's, I don't know. That's, I don't
[11102.27s -> 11111.66s]  know. It'll be plus 10 hours plus 12 hours something EU midnight. You got to add 8 hours.
[11112.30s -> 11117.86s]  I live on the other side of the planet. I'm sorry. Add your ad to the various websites and video. I
[11117.86s -> 11128.77s]  can do advertising. Add duration one day. Do an ad for my stream for one day on the internet.
[11128.77s -> 11139.01s]  A billboard. One billboard for one day. Jerma. New concepts and fun streams are here. Hold on.
[11139.01s -> 11150.13s]  No, no, no, no. We need money. We need money. I need money. How we get money is we keep that stream
[11150.13s -> 11159.26s]  going. I need like two monitors for chat and stuff. What is this? All right. What was it?
[11159.26s -> 11165.78s]  Opening cases. People love that shit. All right. People love it. What can I do on stream that
[11165.78s -> 11177.66s]  people would like think is cool? We got to take a look first. Speed test bank. I could do scratch
[11177.66s -> 11189.14s]  tickets. Buy a house. All right. We'll play blackjack on stream, but not crazy amounts of money.
[11189.14s -> 11202.32s]  All right. Here we go. We're just going to be ASMR. I'll do that later. What's up, all you toxic
[11202.32s -> 11220.06s]  fucks? Today we're going to be playing the fart blackjack on stream. What is this? What amount to
[11220.06s -> 11229.82s]  be? What is this? I don't play blackjack. Oh, this is higher or lower toxic. We're reaching
[11229.82s -> 11236.99s]  levels of toxicity. You never thought possible. I'm going to give you guys some basic strategy.
[11237.92s -> 11255.31s]  Or how to. We're going to do a base. We're doing one dollar bets in blackjack here. Wish I did a
[11255.31s -> 11260.35s]  fucking thousand. Wish I did a thousand guys. I wish it was a thousand. I just got blackjack.
[11260.35s -> 11268.35s]  First dollar bet. Right. I can't even tell. I want to teach you guys how to play. Keck W.
[11272.26s -> 11279.47s]  Stream I enjoy. Thanks for the sub. I got 33 subs. Thanks guys. Okay. So we're going to,
[11279.47s -> 11284.34s]  we'll see what we get for a hand here. We'll get 11 versus a four. Now if I was able to,
[11284.34s -> 11289.25s]  I would double down here. I would double down, but I'm not able to do that on this particular
[11290.37s -> 11295.07s]  game, but we're going to hit this. That's 21. These are dollar bets guys. It's just kind
[11295.07s -> 11303.02s]  of hanging out, having fun with you. Oh, thank you. A la qual for the subscription. Appreciate that.
[11303.02s -> 11315.18s]  Someone realizes that you are sleepless. I stayed up all night watching porn. Thanks for 10 bucks.
[11315.18s -> 11321.70s]  How could you tell that by the way, this streamer is very, he's a nerd. Yes. All right. Let's do,
[11321.70s -> 11329.46s]  let's get a little bit crazy here. Let's go for a seven, a $6 and 90 cent bet. Cause we're a comedy
[11329.46s -> 11337.97s]  guy here. We make lots of funny jokes. That's a 20. I'm looking to stand on 20 guys. Always stand
[11337.97s -> 11348.56s]  with the 20 versus anything like that. And we won again. Cool. Fuck. I banned the wrong guy.
[11348.56s -> 11364.61s]  All right. Everyone relax. We're doing $20 bet. I got a two. Ooh, 21. I am the king of blender.
[11364.61s -> 11371.62s]  You have to pay me taxes. We're getting 91 viewers right now. I got more subs. I didn't like you
[11371.62s -> 11379.06s]  before, but now I do. Toxicity is going up. Should I just run with that? Do something to entertain
[11379.06s -> 11398.85s]  the audience. It's just a good movie. Fucking do something. Fuck 16. Oh crap. Crap. I thought the
[11398.85s -> 11404.74s]  cops were just here. It's like, what the fuck happened? Okay guys, this is for you. This is
[11404.74s -> 11410.46s]  for the stream. This is the big one for the stream. We just passed a hundred concurrent viewers,
[11411.92s -> 11421.07s]  $50 bet for the stream. Oh, and it's a good one. Oh, it's not a good one. We have to stand here.
[11426.90s -> 11437.30s]  Too bad. Oh no. I lost some money. Ooh. Okay guys, I'm going to, uh, I got, uh, I got to go.
[11437.78s -> 11444.46s]  Oh wait, how long has the stream been off? How long was the stream off for?
[11445.18s -> 11466.51s]  Was I even streaming? I'm watching some sick fuck like this at 144 P at 700 bit rate talking like
[11466.51s -> 11475.60s]  that and losing some money and then just ending stream every day like that. This is bizarre.
[11476.24s -> 11489.66s]  At least I got some more subs. You never turned it on. Yes, I did. I was getting, I saw the
[11489.66s -> 11502.85s]  view account. What's wrong with your voice? Are you imitating somebody or are you actually asking
[11502.85s -> 11510.96s]  me that question? Turn the stream right now to 144 P 700 bit rate. I don't think I could do that.
[11516.32s -> 11521.22s]  I would have to read. I have to turn the stream off and back on again. All right. I will,
[11521.22s -> 11533.50s]  I promise I will do that before this stream is over. I have no money. Get a loan. Holy shit.
[11535.84s -> 11542.02s]  Daily installment payments of 800 bucks. That's not going to work. I'll do it. I promise I'll do
[11542.02s -> 11553.76s]  it. It will break everything. Yeah, guys, we're like hanging out, having a fun time. I'm not just
[11553.76s -> 11556.64s]  going to turn the stream off because if I, here's the thing, this is what you guys, this is some
[11556.64s -> 11561.04s]  streamer insight for you guys. If I turn the stream off, even though, even though this boy,
[11561.04s -> 11567.22s]  there's 10,000 people here, you all know that I'm coming back, but like 4,000 of you are gone
[11567.22s -> 11577.12s]  permanently. You're just going to leave. That's just how it works. I actually think it would be
[11577.12s -> 11582.08s]  that kind of a fun experiment to like turn a stream off and back on like 30 times and see
[11582.08s -> 11588.13s]  if you get down to zero. Will one person stick around after you go through? What's the diminishing
[11588.13s -> 11612.54s]  returns? I have to go to work. Have I eaten? All right. I'm okay. I would stay. Thanks. Okay. I mean
[11612.54s -> 11617.66s]  it. No more gambling. I would rather eat food on stream. I'm going to eat food on stream with
[11617.66s -> 11628.48s]  a webcam. That's the new meta. What do you mean gas is going to run out soon? I just got it.
[11630.54s -> 11665.66s]  Excuse me. Can I just buy gas? Yeah. I'm going to put it on ASMR, webcam, with food. I know, I know.
[11669.47s -> 11678.85s]  Someone siphoned gas from the car. I feel like they did. We want you to butt chug. Time that
[11678.85s -> 11684.61s]  person out for real. For at least two minutes. And I'm serious on that one. That's a serious,
[11684.61s -> 11689.17s]  that's a serious time that person out. We make that joke all the time. Oh, man, that guy. Oh,
[11689.17s -> 11695.52s]  modem. Really time that guy out for two minutes. I want him to sit here and think. He's looking at
[11695.52s -> 11701.12s]  his screen saying, we want you to butt chug. I said that. I want this kind of butt chug. Yeah,
[11701.12s -> 11710.74s]  I did say that. All right. I'm back. I'm back. I'm okay. I'm sorry for saying that. Start time.
[11710.74s -> 11719.04s]  What? I missed it? No, I got early. I'm really early. I'm so ready to work. Oh, God. I'm here
[11719.04s -> 11726.56s]  two or three hours early. Is the restaurant even open yet? No, I'll be here. Hey, need somebody to
[11726.56s -> 11735.52s]  help clean the dishes and everything? I'm here. Oh, I know. I'll just tell people to come in the
[11735.52s -> 11739.12s]  restaurant. I'll point at the restaurant and be like a dancing guy in a costume outside.
[11739.12s -> 11758.90s]  Go to the strip club. No, I'm not going to spend any money. This is eerie. Just standing out here.
[11759.62s -> 11777.31s]  Okay, hold on. Look out the back window. You know, kids typically when they look out the back window,
[11777.31s -> 11784.61s]  they go like, if you ever pull up behind a school bus at a red light, there's always like four or
[11784.61s -> 11791.95s]  five kids that are always like pointing at you out the window. And then you go like, oh, hey,
[11792.43s -> 11796.43s]  hey kids. You like cover your eyes and your ears and you go, and they go,
[11798.96s -> 11813.89s]  wave like out the window. Hey kids. I forgot to have to work. Right. And then when the light
[11813.89s -> 11819.97s]  turns green and three or four seconds go by and the school bus driver hasn't gone yet,
[11819.97s -> 11849.12s]  they didn't leave it to me. It's green light. Let's fucking go. Hey, easy. Oh, you're only,
[11849.12s -> 11854.26s]  you're only like nice and sweet into like, I think he's going to get away with that.
[11856.70s -> 11879.04s]  Does he? I need to guess. Yeah. Everybody's nice and sweet until. Can I please just say this line
[11879.04s -> 11884.32s]  that I want to say? I just want to say a line. Everybody's nice and sweet until somebody sits
[11884.32s -> 11901.07s]  at a green light for four seconds. Okay. It goes from this cop has been riding on the sidewalk
[11901.07s -> 11909.14s]  the same every time. Fucking go. I'm hitting the button. I'm out of gas. I'm out of gas. Fucking
[11909.14s -> 11923.39s]  go already. That's why I have no gas. Can I work again? Can I work a good double? I have to take
[11923.39s -> 11936.98s]  an Uber home. It's 50 bucks. I love you. I thought he pulled up and was making that sound with his
[11936.98s -> 11955.34s]  mouth. It's an assassin. Oh shit. Thank God. Yes. Oh my God. I get burritos. I'm so hungry.
[11955.34s -> 11989.63s]  Trunk burrito. Still good. No, it wasn't. Come on. Please. I just want to go. Somebody push me.
[11990.27s -> 12018.83s]  Can I push the car? I can't push the car. I need to, I'm going to have to pay for the gas thing.
[12019.71s -> 12034.02s]  I'm going to get like five jobs. We're taking a streaming break. I need medicine. Fuck. Wait,
[12034.02s -> 12038.30s]  hold on. I'm going to take the rest of the computer parts out of that guy's house.
[12038.86s -> 12057.07s]  Does he live? Where does that dude live? What was that guy's name? Wait, this is the hacker's house.
[12058.62s -> 12061.42s]  Is this the guy that's been hacking me the whole time? Why do I know where he is?
[12062.14s -> 12069.09s]  This is the guy that's been trying to break into my bank account for the last three months.
[12069.81s -> 12116.58s]  Where is he? I thought it was that guy. Wait, where is he? What? What's up? I just
[12116.58s -> 12120.34s]  wanted to ask you a couple of just questions about what you're doing and why you're doing this to me.
[12120.90s -> 12128.16s]  Okay. Uh, price to buy a, oh, this is a cryptocurrency miner. Are you the guy? You're
[12128.16s -> 12138.26s]  not the guy. You're not the guy. The BTC miner. How have you not been found out that you're back
[12138.26s -> 12157.41s]  here? I would, I'll get, I'll come back and get that in a little bit later. Yeah. He's dizzy. I
[12157.41s -> 12167.39s]  know I need medicine and I'm going to run out of gas again. I need gas. Where's the gas station?
[12167.39s -> 12170.59s]  How am I? Oh, this car sucks. What's the miles per gallon on this fucking thing? This thing's
[12170.59s -> 12194.56s]  terrible. Okay. I got gas. We got to turn, go back up and then go down that road. So back up
[12198.10s -> 12220.42s]  and take it. Okay. Let's go. Wait. I'm gonna go stream. What's going on? What? Does this car
[12220.42s -> 12236.99s]  have a leak? I don't, I just bought a quarter tank of gas. I didn't, I went down the street.
[12240.67s -> 12245.34s]  Level up in the skill tree. Oh shit. All right. Yeah.
[12246.14s -> 12257.22s]  Rash meter. I don't have enough money. No gas. Yeah, that's fucked up.
[12258.18s -> 12263.12s]  You will die after your bladder finally says fuck you and explodes.
[12264.02s -> 12271.73s]  You've been on a hundred toilet. All right. I have a plan. Here's my plan. I'm not going to
[12271.73s -> 12277.79s]  fucking work again. I'm not going to work. I'm going to go home. I'm going to stream every day.
[12278.35s -> 12283.73s]  I'm not going to open cases. I'm just going to play fucking fall guys and people are going to
[12283.73s -> 12288.77s]  eat it up. I'm going to make a thousand dollars over the course of a week. Then I'm going to fill
[12288.77s -> 12292.98s]  my car up with gas. I'm going to use the bathroom to buy a bathroom. I'm going to order some pizzas
[12292.98s -> 12309.81s]  and shit and I'm going to be fine for now. I, I have, I have to get home 50 fucking bucks. What
[12309.81s -> 12318.13s]  a joke. That's a plan. Yes it is. So I need food. I need to go to the bathroom. What do I have in
[12318.13s -> 12327.14s]  my wallet? I need to transfer some money to my wallet so I can go to the bathroom in this outhouse
[12327.14s -> 12333.47s]  and then I need medicine too, but I'm okay. I've got 14 health. Okay. Hold on.
[12335.87s -> 12338.83s]  Read these out loud. Just, okay. There we go. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.
[12338.83s -> 12351.36s]  Okay. 47 bucks from my stream lab. Now I need to go to the bank. I gotta pay bills too. Shit.
[12351.36s -> 12362.48s]  I think I saw Zerma at the grocery store and he went like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Buy a toilet.
[12362.48s -> 12381.25s]  I will get necessities. I promise. Electrical interference. Yeah. Oh, okay. Okay. I'm going
[12381.25s -> 12388.16s]  to put some money in my wallet if I can. I know you need medicine. Just hold out a little longer.
[12388.16s -> 12411.23s]  He's going to stream one more day. How can I get money from his bank account? Like why can't the
[12411.23s -> 12419.28s]  hack backfire and I take a hundred bucks from his account? Okay. Transfer to wallet. Let's transfer
[12420.08s -> 12423.04s]  just 10 bucks to the wallet. It's enough to go to the bath. No, 20 bucks. I have to go to the
[12423.04s -> 12445.46s]  bathroom twice. Just buy a toilet. The toilet is $400. I can't afford it. Oh, good. All right.
[12446.02s -> 12465.46s]  I need to buy a new house too, but slow. Baby steps. I need to order some food. I got plenty
[12465.46s -> 12474.30s]  of food. All right. We're locking myself up here. Two burritos. I know. We're going to get two
[12474.30s -> 12485.71s]  burritos and some canned food. Not getting to the second game. No, no. I'm locked in here. I like,
[12485.71s -> 12498.94s]  love this. I'm having a blast. What am I doing? Oh, food. Right, right, right. Get three burritos
[12498.94s -> 12508.50s]  and some beans and just keep them in the desk. Please move on. This isn't fun. I'm playing it.
[12509.14s -> 12518.30s]  Are we both playing this game at the same time? Are you playing it too? I know. I thought this
[12518.30s -> 12528.22s]  isn't fun. Ban that guy permanently. No, we don't ban. We did no permanent bans here. Oh,
[12528.22s -> 12535.98s]  yes, there is. It's a lie. All right. Two clam soups and a couple of burritos and a couple of...
[12535.98s -> 12557.47s]  What lasts? Beef jerky lasts like forever. Get two of these. Get fat. Somebody called me fat,
[12557.47s -> 12563.34s]  right? Somebody was like, oh, you've become obese. I was like, how the fuck do you know that?
[12567.68s -> 12570.40s]  We're streaming enough to get medicine and then we're going to stream permanently.
[12572.37s -> 12585.76s]  It was, you are obese on the computer. Yeah. Thank you. All right. Clam soup. Eat it. Burrito.
[12585.76s -> 12591.34s]  Eat it. Let's... Okay. Eat this clam soup because that will probably not keep very well.
[12591.90s -> 12602.91s]  Hundred. Store the rest in my backpack. Does it matter if it hits the ground? I hope not.
[12612.21s -> 12627.25s]  Somebody said European taxes and American healthcare. Okay. Let's stream. I need
[12627.25s -> 12644.50s]  medicine. I know. I'm working on it. Let's go. What's going on, sinners? It's me, German985,
[12644.50s -> 12654.21s]  coming at you with another live stream. Just, whoa, hold on a minute. Okay, everybody. I want you to
[12656.53s -> 12673.39s]  relax while we... Shh. Everybody breathe in and breathe out.
[12691.22s -> 12699.44s]  Fuck this stream. What? Is it loud? Oh, it's actually going. I don't have both earphones in,
[12699.44s -> 12711.15s]  guys. I only have my right one in. I didn't know that... Hold on. I'm getting a ton of donations.
[12711.15s -> 12773.86s]  I have to keep doing it. I feel dizzy. Where's the toilet one? Which one is toilet? Okay. Thank you
[12773.86s -> 12786.70s]  for your subscriptions. We've got 44. It's 19. Is there a lottery? How we had so much toxicity.
[12787.02s -> 12819.17s]  Relax and enjoy the tingles. Thank you. Click. Estabator for the subscription.
[12819.17s -> 12827.42s]  Bonesie Prime, thanks for the sub. Thank you for the three dollars and one cents. I say I love you.
[12827.42s -> 12836.69s]  Oh, I'm not going to say you too, so you can go fuck yourself. Valti, thanks for the sub. I made
[12836.69s -> 12845.66s]  my coffee. This is a shit stream. Okay. Good stream. Thanks to Pog. Appreciate it. I love you
[12845.66s -> 12850.06s]  very much. I'm preparing a surprise for my darling. Read my name. Do you say your lover...
[12851.26s -> 12887.76s]  Is this live? Yes, it is. Wake up. Stream is over. How much money do we make today from our ASMR
[12887.76s -> 12894.74s]  stream? Oh, 50 bucks. All right. Same thing tomorrow. I got backpack full of burritos.
[12894.74s -> 12914.78s]  That was a madhouse laugh. I will pay you any amount of money to never do that again. Okay.
[12914.78s -> 12932.24s]  The amount is $500 million. Okay. Back at it again. Eat the food in my inventory and then
[12932.24s -> 12940.10s]  let's go. This is a little dirty. That's okay, right? I'm kind of afraid to eat this with 11
[12940.10s -> 12956.37s]  health. I'm going to sell it to the fucking guy. Yeah, let's sell it. I'm terrified. I have 11
[12956.37s -> 12967.22s]  health. Even if I lose like five, that's really bad. Five bucks. I'll take it. I'll take it. Let's
[12967.22s -> 12995.74s]  go. Do I need to use the bathroom? I do. I don't have any money. Why? How are we doing? Okay. I've
[12995.74s -> 13003.62s]  eaten. I'm going to have some beef jerky. How is this dirty? It's beef jerky. If I lose health,
[13003.62s -> 13014.24s]  I'm going to be mad. Oh shit. There's even more in here. I don't know. That's pretty awesome,
[13014.24s -> 13022.62s]  actually. All right. Store that. Only buy beef jerky. It's like the best food ever, apparently.
[13023.18s -> 13038.77s]  All right. I'm back. We're not doing ASMR. We're doing a creative stream today. Okay. Let's do
[13038.77s -> 13044.24s]  some paintings. I'm not going to be reading any sub or chat messages today, guys. I'm concentrating
[13044.24s -> 13067.78s]  on my art. Thank you, whoever that was. Just drop the pen. Uh, that's an eraser. Okay. Hold on. I
[13067.78s -> 13103.09s]  need to... Why do we keep climbing with toxicity? This is so annoying. Good morning. I'm just trying
[13103.09s -> 13125.58s]  to draw a face. Next pen. I need medicine. I'll get it after this. Looking for a favorite streamer?
[13125.58s -> 13134.88s]  That's going to be me. I guarantee it. All right. Can I sell this to one of the viewers?
[13134.88s -> 13147.58s]  Or can I sell this? Xeric opened a stream. Let this disgusting stream. How do I lower this?
[13148.54s -> 13156.21s]  Am I just that unbearable? People are giving me money, though. I'm getting a ton of money.
[13156.21s -> 13162.75s]  Look at all these subscriptions and... Look at all this. This is crazy. This is a sub train.
[13163.31s -> 13174.67s]  This is a huge amount of subs. Okay. That was cool. Now let's erase this and let's make a new one.
[13174.67s -> 13181.07s]  The legend is back. That's right. Here I am. This is going to take too long to erase. So I'm just
[13181.07s -> 13196.35s]  going to go like this and let's... Here. You want to see my bank account? Still at 144p. I'll show you
[13196.35s -> 13211.79s]  guys my bank account on stream. Here's my actual thumbprint. I have 56 bucks. I'm going to transfer
[13211.79s -> 13222.69s]  money to my card. I have like 80 bucks or so. I want to watch me get a loan on stream. 500 bucks.
[13222.69s -> 13225.73s]  I have three days to pay it off. I'm never going to be able to do that. That's way too much.
[13226.69s -> 13232.48s]  More subs. I know everybody in Blender. I see you first stream. How long has the stream started?
[13232.48s -> 13251.49s]  How long do you have been doing this for a job? Sorry. Mic off for now. He's a waiter. Look who it
[13251.49s -> 13264.61s]  is. Nod. Nod P. Getting hacked on stream but blocked him. Still streaming this. Okay. Stream's
[13264.61s -> 13285.02s]  over. I want to play one of the other games. Why did I install fall guys? I need medicine though.
[13287.10s -> 13294.96s]  Okay. I've got 92 dollars. That's not enough. I think I have to just get lucky at blackjack.
[13295.52s -> 13309.17s]  Eat some beef jerky. Go to bed. Loot again. I can't uninstall fall gang. I want to play counter
[13309.17s -> 13324.70s]  strike or fifa. Can I? Wait. Computer. Oh. Hold on a second. Can I go in there and take it out?
[13328.51s -> 13333.44s]  No. No. I don't. Wait. I don't have a microphone. No I do. Okay. I was like wait a minute.
[13333.44s -> 13345.47s]  All right. Let's eat food and go to bed. Where's my beef jerky? Did I have two? I thought I had
[13345.47s -> 13362.03s]  two of these. No. Take out a massive loan and then do a hand in blackjack for all of it.
[13362.03s -> 13370.43s]  I don't know. I think that's a really really bad idea. Go look in trash and see if you can
[13370.43s -> 13380.86s]  find anything. Nothing in this trash. All right. I'm gonna go look around all the dumpsters.
[13380.86s -> 13393.33s]  Nothing in here. I want to buy like a cat and have a dog and stuff. I need to make some money.
[13394.05s -> 13409.10s]  Any more trashes to look through? You have to press space? Take trash. Space. There's nothing
[13409.10s -> 13430.58s]  here. Move. Whoa. Does this hurt? I think that might hurt. No. All right. We're good. This is
[13430.58s -> 13444.40s]  free shit. It is. Oh a gas bottle. Oh a plastic crate. I don't have any more motivation to be in
[13444.40s -> 13452.77s]  the trash anymore. What do these things do? This is a. I can sell it to a dealer. I can sell it to
[13452.77s -> 13460.62s]  a dealer. I can sell these to a dealer. Gonna make some money. Zero hygiene. He's gonna be mad. Take
[13460.62s -> 13483.36s]  a shower. Maybe I can trade him for some medicine. What's up? I got some things for you to look at.
[13483.36s -> 13488.40s]  I've got a water bottle for you to look at. Nine bucks. I've got a gas canister. That's a lot of
[13488.40s -> 13493.04s]  money and a plastic crate. I think we can have make a little bit better of a deal there I think.
[13493.60s -> 13514.05s]  Fuck you. More trash? Nice. Oh how do I get more trash motivation? I think it's a skill point.
[13514.05s -> 13524.32s]  Garbage motivation decreases more slowly. How much is it? I don't have money to do that.
[13524.32s -> 13537.54s]  Back on the stream. Oh you know what? I think I'm gonna take like five jobs. Yeah. I'm gonna try to
[13537.54s -> 13551.23s]  make like 500 bucks in two days. Freelancers. What's this? Gamble a loan you idiot. Imagine
[13551.23s -> 13559.38s]  telling somebody saying the words gamble a loan and then a space bar and then writing you idiot.
[13559.38s -> 13569.92s]  Oh coding? Do I know how to code? You should get a key by finding capital letters and numbers from
[13569.92s -> 13576.48s]  within the scattered code block. You must enter the keys by typing code at the beginning. Get a key
[13577.04s -> 13580.88s]  by finding capital letters and numbers within the scattered code. So I need capital letters
[13580.88s -> 13589.74s]  and numbers in here. Okay. So then I type in code and then wherever you have to look. Let's go.
[13590.30s -> 13614.50s]  Here we go. We've got eight. Eight V. Eight V V. Eight V V five. Eight V V five. Wait eight.
[13614.50s -> 13632.99s]  There's another one. Eight V V five. Eight V V. Wait eight. Code eight V V J eight. Eight V V J
[13635.46s -> 13665.14s]  F five. That's it. It does say code. Got it. Three. Three. Uh zero. Um O. Okay. N. And uh

[13733.12s -> 13757.02s]  F. What do you see? F. I don't see an F. Blind. Hold on. A. P. E. P. There's nothing here. That's it.
[13758.32s -> 13766.24s]  Oh I thought it had to be five. R. F. This is actually really easy to make a bunch of money.
[13766.24s -> 13785.73s]  We just do it. Put R. F. E. B. Um done. That's uh 95 dollars. Let's do it again. This one is 115 bucks.
[13785.73s -> 13806.74s]  Are you kidding me? Let's go. This is where you make the money. That's it. Oh fuck. What was that?
[13806.82s -> 13840.67s]  That was fucked up. Okay. Uh E. E. Uh A. E. A. What's the next one? E. No. D. E. What? What's
[13840.67s -> 13872.61s]  the next one? D. Oh shit. You can get them wrong. J. M. J. J. S. J. S. M. Look for numbers too.
[13872.61s -> 13920.54s]  Is that it? J. S. V. M. Okay. Y. W. K. Uh Y. W. K. A. Oh come on. That was wrong? Eight. O. Y. Five.
[13922.96s -> 13940.72s]  X. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Knock out. 74 dollars. Let's go. This is so easy. We can finally
[13940.72s -> 13966.54s]  buy a toilet if we want. PG-6 and no. PG-6. PG-6 code. We're playing a middle-aged office
[13966.54s -> 13974.02s]  worker simulator. No. We're losing viewers. I'm making money man. Why don't you stream this?
[13974.02s -> 13986.74s]  Holy shit. You're right. This is double money. This is making double money. I can't believe I
[13986.74s -> 14002.51s]  didn't think about that. We'll do that tomorrow. I think that's good. That's it. You can't hack me
[14002.51s -> 14019.38s]  in the middle of doing my own hacking. Hi Luke. Good to see you again. How are the kids? How are
[14019.38s -> 14058.45s]  you? Same time next week? Cool. See you then. U. B. Nine. Z. No. X. A. E. Okay. X. There's a three
[14058.45s -> 14089.01s]  there. X. R. Three. There it is. Fuck. I'm so bad at this. Five. R. B. A. U. Thank you. 42 bucks.
[14089.01s -> 14093.98s]  All right. We'll do this tomorrow on stream. What's my bank account look like? That's probably
[14093.98s -> 14100.22s]  most money I've ever had. Yeah. Look at that. 280 bucks. Good. We'll do it on stream tomorrow.
[14100.22s -> 14116.10s]  I'm going to order some food and we'll go. Legit working. Yeah. But it's all good man.
[14116.74s -> 14125.65s]  Don't even look at this stuff. Beef jerky only. Do we even pay bills anymore?
[14126.70s -> 14137.55s]  I want to. I want to. I want to. Thanks to you this stream. I looked up what Yankee Doodle was
[14137.55s -> 14151.52s]  and I learned about macaroni. Okay. We're going to get a pig and then beef jerky. I got a lot
[14151.52s -> 14159.68s]  of unready meals. Okay. I need to pay bills. That person's right. They probably overdo.
[14163.25s -> 14165.57s]  Get better internet. There's a lot of things I want to get.
[14167.26s -> 14177.46s]  Bills. Why is beef jerky more expensive than a whole... I can't even talk. I'm sorry.
[14179.04s -> 14182.24s]  Words that just have trouble coming out sometimes. I'll get it in a second.
[14182.24s -> 14188.30s]  Let's leave it at the door. No bills. Can I see some pogs in the chap and no bills?
[14188.86s -> 14194.53s]  You know I've started to really like that word pog. I'm older than a lot of you guys,
[14194.53s -> 14204.91s]  but you know it's fun to say sometimes. Okay. Let's put the store these on the shelf.
[14207.90s -> 14222.48s]  That better not be dirty. Where did that go? Are you fucking kidding me? Just keep it in my backpack.
[14222.48s -> 14231.38s]  I don't care. Where'd it go? Can I take a bath? I got to use the bathroom too. Don't touch my beef
[14231.38s -> 14242.40s]  jerky. It's out here. It's mine. Don't touch this. All right. We're going to wake up tomorrow. We're
[14242.40s -> 14254.42s]  going to dig through the trash. We're going to eat some medicine. Sounds good. I have plenty of
[14254.42s -> 14264.96s]  energy. What am I doing? Turn the stream on. Let's go. Let's turn the stream on. Today we're
[14264.96s -> 14272.27s]  doing just chatting and I'm going to do coding on stream. Welcome everybody. How are you? Bear with
[14272.27s -> 14282.48s]  the hearing. We're going to do some coding. I left for an hour and he's still in this dump.
[14282.48s -> 14291.81s]  This game is, it's a slow burn, but I like it. Okay. Freelancer. I can't, I don't understand this.
[14294.02s -> 14314.13s]  I am a boomer. Okay. Coding. Check it out guys. We're going to be coding on stream. Z, F,
[14315.34s -> 14328.26s]  five. This is a very boring stream, isn't it? So you have a five J.
[14334.22s -> 14346.82s]  Fuck it. I fucked it up. I screwed it up. Hey, VOD watchers, skip 20 minutes. All right. That's
[14346.82s -> 14369.86s]  what they should be saying. Okay. Uh, three. H three J, H three R, six R, J. Someone realizes
[14369.86s -> 14376.27s]  that you are sleepless. I'm sorry, but I'm coding right now. Leave me be. Did I do that job right?
[14376.27s -> 14392.82s]  I did. Okay. Code four. I'm making triple money. This is the way to do it. G. I'm getting a lot of
[14392.82s -> 14424.30s]  money. Two. Oh my fucking God. It's all right. The donations are still coming in. Is it? Hey,
[14424.30s -> 14431.74s]  what do you think about that? I know everybody in the blender. See the first, I think the 18 plus
[14431.74s -> 14435.34s]  chatting. People wonder what you think about the shape of the world. The world is flat. The world
[14436.14s -> 14453.89s]  is flat. We're going to do, we're going to, okay, sure. The world is flat stream over F, A, S, E,
[14460.53s -> 14474.16s]  20 bucks. That's not even worth doing this. 10 bucks worse than FTK. Get out of here.
[14475.36s -> 14493.47s]  I'm scrolling over my chat. I'm going to ban you. All right, let's go medicine. All right. I can
[14493.47s -> 14512.94s]  buy the medicine. 200 bucks. That's such a bum. That's such a money sink. I need money. Ah,
[14513.58s -> 14526.67s]  let's say he's a, this guy's a positive streamer. I'm not as toxic as this guy.
[14527.23s -> 14536.19s]  All right. So I said, you guys are about 30, 40% toxic on that meter. Where am I? Over 50,
[14536.19s -> 14568.22s]  under 50, 50%. There's nothing in there. How can you have nothing in there? Just crap. Take it.
[14571.20s -> 14585.49s]  Fuck, whatever. I'll just sell it to him. Why is there even a wallet in the game? Why can I just
[14585.49s -> 14599.26s]  swipe my credit card into the lock? All right, let's go sell this stuff to this guy. And then
[14599.26s -> 14603.90s]  I actually am going to go and see if I can go take some computer parts out of that guy's house.
[14603.90s -> 14626.75s]  I'll take pills. Get a better house. You see how much of a struggle it has been for me to keep
[14626.75s -> 14635.38s]  $50 without blowing it on beef jerky and CSGO cases? You think I'm going to get like
[14635.38s -> 14643.14s]  hundreds of thousands of dollars? Short stream today of me transferring money into my wallet.
[14643.14s -> 14665.87s]  Just a quick one. Short stream of me just transferring money. What's the cap?
[14666.43s -> 14682.69s]  Okay. Let's transfer to my wallet. Let's just put like 50 bucks in here and then let's transfer.
[14683.41s -> 14694.53s]  Okay. We're good. No, I need 200 total money in wallet, total money on the card. Transfer
[14694.53s -> 14703.84s]  this money back to my account. Give me transfer to wallet. Okay. Let's go get that medicine.
[14717.57s -> 14726.91s]  The stream is still on. Okay. What am I stupid? Why wouldn't I just turn the stream on
[14727.63s -> 14739.38s]  and fucking leave and go to work? What if the computer gets hacked?
[14740.42s -> 14751.60s]  You'll get hacked. Has it happened yet? Hey guys, I'm back. Childhood memory. Say you were a very
[14751.60s -> 14764.82s]  clever baby. Tell the memory you pissed underneath. Okay. How much money do I got? I'm going to keep
[14764.82s -> 14769.70s]  like I'm keeping money on my wallet because seriously I need it. I put gas and all that.
[14772.16s -> 14784.29s]  Thanks guys. 84 viewers. I need to buy a webcam. That's really important. I have enough money to
[14784.29s -> 14809.06s]  buy a webcam. Oh man. Somebody gave a lot of money. Who gave a lot of money? Just read them
[14809.06s -> 14826.03s]  all on stream and they'll keep coming. Okay. I closed the stream. That's fine. I'll take the
[14826.03s -> 14830.83s]  160 bucks please. Awesome. Now we're making moves. This is where it really gets, this is where it's
[14830.83s -> 14840.22s]  going to be good. How much is a fridge? How much is a shitty fridge? 200 bucks. I can afford that.
[14840.22s -> 14862.11s]  I can afford it. Fridge and a webcam. 112. God, Luke just picked somebody else to do this to.
[14864.50s -> 14878.66s]  Anybody else but me. Luke, I'm just going to move. I'm going to get a new house anyways. All right.
[14880.74s -> 14888.42s]  Ball? Webcam? This one here is 112 bucks streaming for webcams. I need 312 bucks. All right. Let's
[14888.42s -> 14909.31s]  put that on the credit card. Level up. That's a fridge and a webcam. You need a toilet. Streaming
[14909.31s -> 14918.91s]  comes first. Do I have any food? I do. Is this dirty? It's a little dirty. It's okay. It should
[14918.91s -> 14936.82s]  be fine. Yeah, that's good. I got any money on the wallet? No. But I'm just like, my underwear is
[14936.82s -> 14950.16s]  sagging behind me. Like Santa's knapsack. Like Santa has all your presents in there. Go to sleep.
[14950.16s -> 14966.83s]  Well, that's the grossest thing you've heard all day. Come on. It's been four hours. I'm a little
[14966.83s -> 14989.06s]  gross, but not that gross I don't think. There's a wheel in here. That fridge is huge. Can I fit
[14989.06s -> 14997.92s]  this fridge in my house? It's as big as a doorway. Oh, dude, we're going to have a streamer fridge.
[14998.48s -> 15013.18s]  What an ugly fridge. That's the worst streamer fridge ever. Oh, and I can sell that. A Red Bull
[15013.18s -> 15018.99s]  fridge. No, this is the, this is the fridge that, so if you have a, if you buy a new fridge,
[15019.63s -> 15023.63s]  this is the fridge that becomes the second fridge that ends up in your garage.
[15023.63s -> 15036.51s]  All right. Let me go. I need, I can buy a bunch of food now. That's the best part about this.
[15036.51s -> 15040.66s]  I can actually buy food. I don't know why, but for a second, I thought this was a second fridge
[15040.66s -> 15052.35s]  lying down. I can buy and store food. Oh, thank goodness. A webcam. Get this shit on here. And
[15052.35s -> 15073.46s]  I'm doing a webcam stream to test it out. Let's have the donations roll to fucking. All right.
[15073.46s -> 15082.67s]  Settings. Full screen cam. Show cam. Recommended bit rate. Stream settings. Full screen camera.
[15089.17s -> 15097.90s]  Wait. Hey guys. Welcome to stream. I'm taking you guys on a, oh, you can't do that. It's all
[15097.90s -> 15114.19s]  right. If I'm back, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back. I got a cam now. What do you guys think? Thank you.
[15121.60s -> 15131.26s]  I can't change this. What is this even a picture of? This isn't the wrong spot. This isn't a
[15131.26s -> 15137.39s]  terrible spot. Wait, can I move the camera? Nice fucking slideshow. Wait, I have an idea.
[15137.95s -> 15163.79s]  Be serious. My computer's disconnected. I turned off the computer with a shitty stream.
[15169.78s -> 15181.62s]  Oh, that's so stupid. Can I get a chair that's not a baby high chair?
[15182.26s -> 15190.74s]  Turn it on. What's wrong with the computer? Stream in the bathroom. Oh, you give me ideas. I wait
[15190.74s -> 15212.96s]  till I have my own house. Sorry guys. That's my fault. I screwed up a little bit. I'm back.
[15216.58s -> 15227.04s]  Can you see me? Please fix this. What's wrong with it? Misuse other streamers to attract viewers.
[15227.04s -> 15238.93s]  I mean, just how many people are coming in? 40% of stream. This game is so fucking. Talk about
[15238.93s -> 15242.77s]  artistic things to improve the quality of the stream. Talk about beautiful pictures.
[15242.77s -> 15254.83s]  Art is boring. All right. Let's talk about beautiful pictures. I need to point the webcam
[15254.83s -> 15266.53s]  at my face. Stream trend. Focus on your own chat. Tell a story. Let's tell a story. Where are the
[15266.53s -> 15278.11s]  donations? Oh, here we go. It's time to do a joke. Cheap joke. Clever joke. Great stream. Thank you.
[15278.83s -> 15283.81s]  Oh, I can pretend there's a sub train so people will just start to subscribe because they think
[15283.81s -> 15291.90s]  it's a sub train that's going on. Whoa, dude. Oh, that's not even. I thought that was real.
[15294.16s -> 15307.39s]  People say that they are bored. This is too real, man. This is too real for me.
[15311.26s -> 15316.59s]  If you never make money on streaming, will you keep doing it? That would do it for fun.
[15318.88s -> 15325.09s]  Huge viewer count. All right. I got something crazy. What do I do? This is the most viewers I've
[15325.09s -> 15340.18s]  ever had. What is what movie you like? I don't know. Action. Viewers are skyrocketing. I want
[15340.18s -> 15346.16s]  to be a streamer, but the blender refused. Oh fuck. That was pretty good though. That was
[15346.16s -> 15357.06s]  almost 200 concurrent viewers. That's a big deal. Put your face cam on the game's monitor.
[15362.34s -> 15381.12s]  Yeah, I can't put it anywhere. I want to put it right here. Put it on the shelf.
[15381.76s -> 15392.70s]  Look, I can't do it. Look. See? And by the way, what images is this even taking? Why is it not
[15392.70s -> 15420.43s]  showing me? Do a feet cam? I don't think I can even do that. Come on. All right. Let's go. Stream
[15420.43s -> 15429.87s]  outside your house. I need better internet. I need money too. This game is actually pretty hard.
[15429.87s -> 15440.08s]  It really is. Try to get a better stream quality. Yeah, but I drop. People go drop, drop, drop
[15440.08s -> 15444.61s]  frames. This stream sucks. Loser. All right. Let me dig. Let me do some trash digging.
[15445.25s -> 15474.08s]  Damn it. Yeah. I need better internet first. Come on. All right. Do you want this weird wheel? How
[15474.08s -> 15486.99s]  much is this worth? Well, bucks. I have to take it. All right. Now is the time where I'm going to
[15486.99s -> 15492.43s]  take a bunch. I'm going to take like a bunch of jobs that at least two jobs that I can go to
[15492.43s -> 15508.67s]  back to back. Let's take a look at our bank account. 118 bucks. I feel like I'm always
[15508.67s -> 15518.80s]  at 118 bucks. It's always at one to 200. Okay. Stream. Hmm. What can I do here?
[15519.36s -> 15541.07s]  Buy a toilet. I need 400 bucks. I want to just gamble. What is fast net? Well, here's the thing.
[15541.07s -> 15551.90s]  How much more is the better internet package? It might not be that much more. Hold on. This
[15551.98s -> 15560.91s]  is the package that I have. Two down, one up. This is four down, one up. That sucks. $20
[15560.91s -> 15570.53s]  for four every four days. Or I can do turbo. You can buy a maximum of one turbo package every day.
[15570.53s -> 15578.61s]  So hold on. This is I, if I stream with that's 300, that's $33,000. All right. Let me get ready
[15578.61s -> 15585.02s]  for that. I need to eat. I'm going to get sleep and I'm going to turbo boost and do an insane
[15585.02s -> 15618.10s]  IRL stream. I'm going to order some food. Turbo boost into the bathroom. What are your opinions
[15618.10s -> 15630.22s]  on this emote? Let's see. Is that a bag on somebody's head? What is that? All right. Let's
[15630.22s -> 15636.27s]  get food, cheap food that I can put in the refrigerator. Let's get some sodas, three sodas,
[15636.99s -> 15652.02s]  two waters, an energy bar, some apple juice. Somebody once told me the world was
[15652.50s -> 15657.62s]  going to roll me. I'm sorry. It's the first thing I thought of. I'm sorry. I know everyone's going
[15657.62s -> 15661.54s]  to do that. Everyone's going to say, yeah, it was terrible, but come on. I had to do that.
[15662.42s -> 15666.90s]  I had to do that. Stop treating me this way or I'll start banning everybody.
[15670.67s -> 15680.80s]  Don't make fun of me. I'm in control here. All right. That's enough for now.
[15681.74s -> 15698.98s]  No, you dick. Okay. I don't understand the internet. Okay. You put Shrek on the screen
[15698.98s -> 15703.30s]  and have that song playing in the background and everybody pogs their pants and plus two,
[15703.30s -> 15707.63s]  holy shit, the best thing I've ever seen in my life. You just sing the song and you're an
[15707.63s -> 15716.37s]  asshole and let's put his head in the guillotine. It's like they both have to be combined for that
[15716.37s -> 15724.22s]  to work, I guess. Bunch of clam soups. All right. Complete payment. We're going to fridge this shit
[15724.22s -> 15738.93s]  up. Pog needs to be banned. Why? Why do you want to ban Pog? We haven't even clicked on the deep web
[15738.93s -> 15747.90s]  app. By the way, if you see an app that says the deep web app, don't click it. It's not really the
[15747.90s -> 15758.10s]  deep web. This website is built on a blockchain that cannot be followed. It cannot be followed,
[15758.10s -> 15769.52s]  but every move you make leaves a new trace. Please pay attention to your steps. You cannot
[15769.52s -> 15775.63s]  sell online for security reasons. You can get a minor device. Okay. Backdoor hack. After the
[15775.63s -> 15779.71s]  hacking attack, if you have backdoor hacking, you can hack the person who hacked you. What?
[15780.51s -> 15792.30s]  Wait, we can finally get our revenge on Luke, the hacker. Okay. I need to get some BTC.
[15792.30s -> 15797.49s]  It's too much to do in this game. I have to focus on one thing at a time. This is like the ADHD
[15797.49s -> 15813.28s]  nightmare game. All right. Perfect. This is a soda. Drink it up. Crackers. Delicious. All right.
[15813.28s -> 15826.26s]  Put the burritos in the fridge. Put us all in the fridge, actually. And then what was I going to do?
[15826.26s -> 15838.98s]  Something very specific. BTC. No, no, no. Something else. Oh, the web boost. Right. The web boost
[15838.98s -> 15857.36s]  can do a one-time only super stream. All right. Store this out. Into the fridge it goes. Well,
[15857.36s -> 15872.61s]  why did I just zip my pants? Use the toilet urgently. Don't worry. I'm going to make sure
[15872.61s -> 15879.31s]  that the stream that I do, I'm going to be fully washed and fully bathroomed. Don't worry. I promise.
[15879.31s -> 15886.08s]  All right. We've eaten. I actually should probably have a little bit of apple juice.
[15888.00s -> 15897.28s]  I love apple juice. 100. Cool. All right. I got pretty good health. Let's put 10, let's put 20
[15897.28s -> 15901.41s]  bucks in my bank account in my wallet so I can go pay the guy to use the bathroom. And we'll go from
[15901.41s -> 15916.69s]  there. And we're going to get the super boost internet and I'm going to turn the stream on
[15917.25s -> 15938.10s]  and we're going to get a huge amount of people. Okay. 9K Andy. You're on this shit again. All
[15938.10s -> 15942.61s]  right. Where's the bathroom? All right. I'm going to finally use the bathroom. It's been a week.
[15943.33s -> 15963.38s]  Thank you. Appreciate it. Take a shower. Close the fucking door. I want to be left alone right now.
[15963.38s -> 15970.96s]  Internet boost and I'm going to play Dark Souls. No ASMR gave us way more money. No way. Yeah.
[15970.96s -> 15976.83s]  ASMR gave way more money. We do ASMR for like four hours. Just turn that turn the volume. Guys,
[15976.83s -> 15982.82s]  it's the biggest money maker. Just turn your volume down a little bit. Fast net. Let's go.
[15982.82s -> 16000.08s]  Turn off the VPN. Oh shit. All right. So this is $20 every four days. This is two megabits up.
[16000.08s -> 16019.81s]  This is double what we have now. We just do the soup, the big one. This is three. All right. It's
[16019.81s -> 16024.86s]  going to be worth it. I'm going to make a bunch of money. This is a big one. Oh, I have a ton of
[16024.86s -> 16035.78s]  internet now. Okay. OBS. Just start the stream. I don't even care what it is. At least you wait
[16035.78s -> 16049.31s]  until I'm done with a sentence. He never interrupts me. He always just waits for a sentence break.
[16049.31s -> 16057.97s]  Turn the stream on. Okay. OBS. Stream settings. Normal camera. Go cam. Normal cam.
[16058.53s -> 16065.87s]  We're going to save this stream. 2200 bit rate. We can do that. Quality. We're going to go to 360p.
[16065.87s -> 16082.24s]  We're going to go 360p. Don't save the stream. 60 FPS. 30 FPS at 2700. This is big deal.
[16082.80s -> 16097.15s]  Let's go. What's up? How's everybody doing? How do you like the quality? Pretty good, huh?
[16103.68s -> 16111.57s]  There are people in chat who write without using their brain. Welcome to life. All right. How do
[16111.57s -> 16117.10s]  you like it? How's the quality? What do you think of the shape of the world? The world is geo it.
[16117.10s -> 16130.54s]  I don't know what that means. No drop frames either. No donations. This is a, this is a boost.
[16130.54s -> 16141.95s]  I need money. Stream control. Chat only. Video rendition stream. What? Video rendition. I have
[16141.95s -> 16151.02s]  to do something. Where's my camera? Oh, there it is. Full cam. People love the full cam.
[16151.74s -> 16169.92s]  Let's go to ASMR. Turn your headphones down. Turn your headphones down. Here comes the donations.
[16169.92s -> 16204.86s]  Read them all. Rate stream. Subscribe. Subscribe. Subscribed. Fan the wrong guy. Whatever.
[16204.86s -> 16211.79s]  We're about to break 200 viewers. 200 viewers. Here comes the 200. Come on. Do it. And I could
[16211.79s -> 16225.94s]  get partner at 400. Big money coming in. This guy's only got one trigger. Okay. Is this a big
[16226.02s -> 16241.07s]  Great Dane shaking his head around? Read the fucking donations. Hold on. I love you. Hey,

[16276.35s -> 16283.41s]  shake my stomach around for you more after drinking three Gatorades. You know you love it.

[16341.68s -> 16351.41s]  12 bucks. This is a big deal. Okay. Is it really good to just grab a bunch of shit on my desk and
[16351.41s -> 16358.02s]  just knocking it around and just go like, I bet, you know, I'd probably be a really good ASMR
[16358.02s -> 16374.16s]  streamer. Think about that. I could probably just sit there and be like, I'd make a million
[16374.16s -> 16392.70s]  dollars in a day. Oh, Hey, we've got some money. Can you say my darling's name? Hey kitty. Thanks
[16392.70s -> 16406.00s]  for the sub. This is fucking torture. Whisper, please. Someone stole my credit card and subscribe
[16406.00s -> 16412.38s]  to you. How would you even know that? Read my message. We're at 300. Come on. We're at 300
[16412.86s -> 16418.90s]  years. We can get higher than this. We can get high in this. No, that was right. That was up.
[16418.90s -> 16436.66s]  I was right in the middle of the big deal. Right. Killed it. Okay. Here we go. Let's see if I can
[16436.66s -> 16445.78s]  apply for partner. Become a partner. Join in the I'm ready. I'm in the approval process. I just
[16445.78s -> 16451.73s]  applied average viewers, total subs, total followers. Hey, I got the average. I got the subs,
[16451.73s -> 16476.77s]  total followers, 400, 107 subs, expected earnings, 283. What? All right. Tomorrow I'm getting up early
[16476.77s -> 16484.80s]  and we're going to do an ad. I'm going to do an ASMR ad stream. What the hell was I doing? Okay.
[16484.80s -> 16501.89s]  I got a lot of money. 154 bucks. Not bad. Tomorrow. We're back tomorrow. Donation said to stream while
[16501.89s -> 16524.40s]  you sleep. Yeah. I'm going to get hacked. I need to hire mods. Oh, okay. Please change the stream
[16524.40s -> 16536.14s]  title from aces only. Don't even own counterstrike. Okay. We're going to do a 90 second ad every 90
[16536.14s -> 16566.62s]  seconds and see what happens. No, that's too, that's, that's, that's okay. Whatever. Who cares?
[16566.62s -> 16577.55s]  Come on, ban me. Will I get to see my name pop up here eventually? I'm supposed to be right here.
[16577.55s -> 16588.90s]  I'm supposed to be right here. I'm right here. What the fuck? Did I get it? No, I got, I got
[16588.90s -> 16597.98s]  declined. It's cold. What do you mean cold? Is it, has it been, has it winter time? What year is it?
[16600.85s -> 16623.12s]  All right. I'm going to have some burritos and a water. Refreshing. Not bad. All right. Nice and
[16623.12s -> 16641.95s]  hydrated. Let's go use the bathroom. Punch the water. All right. Now I have my boost, right?
[16641.95s -> 16647.01s]  Okay. I'm ready. Same deal. What I said, I said I was going to do, uh, I'm going to run a bunch
[16647.01s -> 16660.35s]  of ads, do ASMR because it kills new title, show cam, start that stream, stream settings.
[16662.51s -> 16666.91s]  God damn it, Luke. Luke, one of these days, I'm going to hit you back hard.
[16680.06s -> 16689.86s]  Okay. We're back. Okay. Let's run ads. Wait, don't run ads yet. Wait till there's like a bunch of
[16689.86s -> 16698.56s]  people here. What's my stream look like? Okay. I got my full camera pointing at nobody apparently.
[16698.56s -> 16720.06s]  Let's get those triggers going. This is very cold. Here comes the subs. 23 bucks. I love pizza.
[16720.06s -> 16729.07s]  Thanks for the $7. Thanks for the sub. Thanks for the sub. Thanks for the sub. Put the music on too.
[16729.07s -> 16758.58s]  Music on an ASMR stream. That seems kind of odd, but I, okay. Okay. Shaking to the beat.
[16759.54s -> 16788.99s]  I'm so bored. I just go into a stream and have the fat guy naked, shaking his stomach to the beat of the song.
[16790.11s -> 16804.21s]  And you say that you're bored. It's boring. Boring. I need to run ads. Just run them again.
[16827.47s -> 16831.23s]  This guy would fuke. This guy would fucking fuke.
[16834.22s -> 16843.84s]  I can't do it very much longer, everybody. I can only have five E-rates before I throw up.
[16848.83s -> 16868.19s]  400 concurrent viewers. Viewers, sweat up. Oh, too much. Too much. Too much. Slow down.
[16869.15s -> 16900.02s]  He's tapping on his stomach. Oh shit. How much money did I make? $24.
[16900.66s -> 16920.08s]  So much toxicity. Funny. Funny. Cry. Cry. Cry. Subscribed. That's it?
[16922.40s -> 16929.57s]  Like shaking my stomach around to the music? Come on, man. Really? It shouldn't be like that.
[16937.55s -> 16945.74s]  We're doing it again tomorrow. We're doing it again tomorrow. We're doing it again tomorrow.
[16945.74s -> 16948.70s]  We're doing it again tomorrow. We're doing it again. We're going to do that again tomorrow,
[16948.70s -> 16956.61s]  but we're going to go even higher quality. I need to go to sleep first.
[16970.94s -> 16975.84s]  Get the turbo? You have the better internet route. Just get the turbo today.
[16978.32s -> 16984.72s]  Fucked up stream. Okay. Eat. And then I'm putting some cash on my wallet so I can
[16984.72s -> 16999.02s]  go out there and use the toilet. Pay taxes. I can buy a toilet? No. Why would I buy a toilet
[16999.02s -> 17004.43s]  if things are going so well? I just need some money on my wallet. Just buy a toilet. Fine.
[17004.43s -> 17018.02s]  All right. I'll buy a damn toilet. I have 500 bucks. All right. We need to have another song.
[17018.02s -> 17025.02s]  Another like shake juggle ASMR tap the stomach stuff. People loved that stream. That's their
[17025.02s -> 17035.68s]  favorite stream. We're going up to HD quality. 720p coming up. Full screen camera. And we're
[17035.68s -> 17042.61s]  saving this one. And it's going to be 60 FPS. 120 FPS. You're going to be able to see the
[17042.61s -> 17051.58s]  jiggling stomach, slow motion, the wrinkles and shit. How much do I need? I need 8,700. What
[17051.58s -> 17059.46s]  do I have? Three? I can't do it. We're going to have to stay with 60 maybe. What's the boost?
[17060.10s -> 17072.48s]  It's three. With the turbo boost it'll be five. What's six? All right. Maybe we're not ready for
[17072.48s -> 17084.00s]  60 FPS yet. All right. I've got 99% energy. I'm ready. Wait. Don't do it yet. I need to go to the
[17084.00s -> 17119.68s]  bathroom. Buy the toilet. There. This is just what he does. And people love it. We can run ads too.
[17120.40s -> 17125.20s]  Minimize this. All right. That looks okay. We'll go come back here. I just want to go. I need to
[17125.20s -> 17133.50s]  buy toilet. Hasn't paid bills or taxes in years. Just juggles his stomach to the beat naked on
[17133.50s -> 17140.74s]  Twitch. Stop saying Twitch because it's not. Blender. Let's just put $500 bet right now on
[17140.74s -> 17147.15s]  Blackjack and then end the stream. All right. Mods. Let's see if we can get this. Hire a moderator
[17147.15s -> 17165.39s]  for stream. Own number of moderators to be hired. One is $5. Let's get two. Five dollars to mod.
[17167.79s -> 17185.44s]  That's the salary. Change the ban rate. Where's my $5? Ban rates. Mod ignores. Mod ban machine.
[17185.44s -> 17200.72s]  Balanced. Oh. Well, they're going to be pretty soft. Okay. I'm going to buy the fast net booster.
[17201.44s -> 17208.96s]  After I buy a toilet. God. I can't even pay attention to anything. I'm going to pee again.
[17208.96s -> 17218.96s]  We're going to pee one more time. Toilet. The cheapest shittiest one I can get. You're just
[17218.96s -> 17229.47s]  pissing it. Who cares? Finally have a toilet. We still have $288. Are we going to do a green screen?
[17230.11s -> 17248.50s]  Are we going to put a small ram in here? Green screen. Softbox? No. I can't afford this.
[17249.06s -> 17256.00s]  How are we doing on everything else? All right. I need to eat something.
[17256.72s -> 17263.06s]  I'm going to eat this last meal and I'm ready. I'm going to do it again. This time super boosted.
[17263.62s -> 17284.45s]  I need a gamer chair. I kind of do, don't I? Take a shower. Okay. Time to buy it. Buy the
[17284.45s -> 17300.38s]  boost. 5k up stream. Toilet. I don't think the toilet's here. Doesn't take a day to deliver.
[17302.86s -> 17317.31s]  That's not here yet. Webcam. Here we go. Turbo. Upload plus three. So this is, that's 6k.
[17317.95s -> 17330.72s]  I got the boost. I'm at 6k up right now. So we can do 60 FPS. Damn it. We can't. 30 FPS.
[17330.72s -> 17340.74s]  We'll do 6,000 up. Save this stream. Dreamsetty's full screen camera. ASMR. Let's get the music
[17340.74s -> 17359.54s]  ready. What's the song? Hello everybody. Welcome back to Juggles the Great's 140th stream of his
[17359.54s -> 17366.62s]  career. I just wanted to be the first to welcome you and say I love all of you and I love the subs
[17366.62s -> 17372.70s]  and I love the bits and I love all the money that you give me. I love you too.
[17374.67s -> 17381.22s]  Watching while eating. Oh, I ate a lot earlier. I ate a lot earlier if you could already tell.
[17384.34s -> 17389.62s]  So if I do, please do announce the next song we're going to be doing this afternoon.
[17391.57s -> 17399.70s]  I'm up. I'm ready. I'm stretched. Are you ready? Are you ready?
[17401.31s -> 17408.66s]  Mods, take care of some of these little assholes. Coming up next on the track we have.
[17409.71s -> 17415.23s]  Palm Avenue. This is going to be a good one. Hope you're all ready. Okay.
[17423.33s -> 17441.09s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going to get a little sweaty. So what the hell's happening? Somebody's hacking
[17441.09s -> 17447.30s]  me. Hold on everybody. Just everybody calm down for just a minute. We'll take care of this piece
[17447.30s -> 17460.37s]  of shit. CWC. Oh, I blocked his ass. We're okay. We're good. Where was I?
[17461.33s -> 17478.53s]  All right. Sometimes I forget what I do here. Hey, do you like zootubers? Of course I love
[17478.53s -> 17486.85s]  zootubers. I love them. You know, I used to be a zootuber myself. Don't forget me in the future. I
[17486.85s -> 17497.60s]  won't gastroscope. I will not forget you. Of course I would. Hey, y'all want to see somebody
[17497.60s -> 17507.73s]  eat something? No, I don't have any food in the fridge. Somebody gave some money. Let's check out
[17507.73s -> 17513.84s]  who that was. Hey, what do you say we really get this poppin', huh? I needed another song.
[17517.04s -> 17552.00s]  Ah, we need some bigger, bigger than that. It's tough to hurt after a while, but I do it for you.
[17552.96s -> 17566.53s]  Ah, I love everybody here. We're just going to get partner suit. Oh, good night. I'm going to bed.
[17567.57s -> 17587.06s]  I didn't run ads. Shit. This dude gets banned. This dude gets banned every day. He just makes
[17587.06s -> 17595.55s]  a new account and he titles his stream the same thing so everyone knows where to find him. If he
[17595.55s -> 17600.67s]  look, think about that. If he titles every single one of his streams, juggles the great stream number
[17600.67s -> 17607.57s]  142 tomorrow, right? If he just makes a new account, he's just going to make people know what to look
[17607.57s -> 17625.36s]  for. Upload that VOD. Oh, right, right, right. Yeah, yeah. It'd be copycats. You'd find the real
[17625.36s -> 17634.78s]  thing. All right, publish that video. How's it doing? I wish we could watch this video.
[17636.13s -> 17644.19s]  Okay, the video's three hours and 36 minutes. That is a very, very long time to be doing that.
[17644.19s -> 17653.30s]  All right, I'm going to piss. I'll be right back. Actually, like not in the video game.
[17653.30s -> 17770.69s]  Give me one sec. Uh, did you guys say there was a raid? Did I miss a raid earlier? It was.
[17770.69s -> 17792.02s]  It was a juggles raid. Oh, I see. Okay. Let's get back to this here. So that's our video. I'm tired.
[17792.90s -> 17797.54s]  Speaking of getting paid, let's see how much money that stream made. I didn't,
[17797.54s -> 17805.06s]  I couldn't even see the stream labs. Holy shit. Look at this. I can't even scroll up far enough.
[17805.06s -> 17812.37s]  26, eight, 10 bucks. People love juggles the great. This is awesome. How much money might
[17812.37s -> 17824.91s]  get paid? 68. Let's see though. Dude. Holy shit. Oh, actually it was all right. I thought that was,
[17825.55s -> 17829.79s]  I thought I was. Sorry. Sorry. I gained a lot of traction. I gained a lot of traction. I bought a
[17829.79s -> 17849.94s]  toilet. That's right. I didn't run the ads stake. You got to play some games. Juggles is a wholesome
[17849.94s -> 17858.93s]  streamer. He doesn't play ads. Yeah. Let's take a look at the skill tree. I have money.
[17858.93s -> 17865.66s]  My goodness. There's a toilet finally. I don't have to pay anybody anymore.
[17878.74s -> 17892.02s]  All right. And yeah, let's get some light in here. X garbage motivation decreases more slowly.
[17892.02s -> 17895.39s]  That's a hundred. That's, I don't know. I don't know about that. I feel like I don't even want
[17895.39s -> 17904.59s]  that. I'm going to get it though. Open extra slots in your inventory. That's a lot of money.
[17905.31s -> 17910.69s]  Number of miners you can buy and decrease your YouTube video upload limit.
[17911.25s -> 17914.18s]  How did they, did they expect me to have this much money?
[17919.23s -> 17924.67s]  What is this? Item transfer and use of inventory items are much faster. That's kind of pointless.
[17925.82s -> 17930.78s]  Get a BTC miner. I just, I don't know. I need money again. I think I got this thing going with
[17930.86s -> 17945.65s]  the juggles. Oh, that'd be fucked. I need food. Let's buy some. You know what? I also need another
[17945.65s -> 17956.32s]  hard drive. The video made 10 bucks. No, what? Re-upload it. No, re-upload it. Oh, come on. I
[17956.32s -> 17981.89s]  didn't get paid. What a misclick. That was one of his best streams. All right. I need to get,
[17982.61s -> 17986.85s]  what am I buying here? I need food. I also need something else to do. What do I need?
[17988.34s -> 17997.50s]  He keeps talking about how hard it is. Hard drive. Right. Okay. HDD and SSD. Something cheap.
[17998.22s -> 18011.31s]  175 bucks right here. Okay. I need to buy this. Somebody said completing a game lets you delete
[18011.31s -> 18031.50s]  it from your hard drive. I got to pay bills too. Oh, very overdue. Very overdue. This one's due
[18031.50s -> 18043.04s]  today. We got a stream today. We got a stream right now. We got a stream right now. Impromptu
[18043.04s -> 18059.47s]  stream. Let's go. Hey, everybody. It's me. Juggles are great. You know what we do here.
[18078.88s -> 18082.16s]  What's the problem? What's the problem here? What's going on? What are you talking about?
[18082.16s -> 18093.97s]  Drop, drop. Please fix. Fix what? Oh, what the fuck? Oh, what the fuck? What's going on with
[18094.45s -> 18101.20s]  the internet? I don't know. How do I fix this? Oh, let me sit down. Let me sit down for this.
[18104.29s -> 18113.39s]  I ate two cakes today for this impromptu stream. Fix, fix, drop. Do you hate YouTubers?
[18113.39s -> 18121.92s]  Fucking ban that guy. He's annoying. All he does. How do I fix it though? Drop, drop, drop. Hello,
[18121.92s -> 18129.02s]  swearing prohibited. Shut the fuck up, man. Hey, thanks for the money. I said my internet
[18129.02s -> 18135.87s]  is in my computer. Maybe I need a better computer. All right. Well, sorry. I'm really
[18135.87s -> 18139.87s]  sorry everybody that this is happening. But the computer I don't know. I don't know what's
[18139.87s -> 18149.04s]  happening here. Fucking get out of here. I do what I can how we normally do. But I can only do so
[18149.04s -> 18170.85s]  much with the computer. Sorry about that. I just I'm gonna run a few ads. Maybe we'll shake around
[18170.85s -> 18178.21s]  a little you know, like you guys. We don't need that much stream power for that. I don't think
[18179.26s -> 18185.49s]  I'm gonna write a couple ads. Take a take a minute and see if the internet kind of gets better. Oh
[18185.49s -> 18194.64s]  shit. These are due today. Hold on just a minute. I'm gonna run a few ads and you'll just support
[18194.64s -> 18200.75s]  the stream support. You know me shaking around. I know how everybody has ended that I'll see you
[18200.75s -> 18213.34s]  soon. Hey, how the fuck am I gonna fix this bullshit? Hold on. I'm turning this off. No,
[18213.34s -> 18219.79s]  no, I don't want to show that. I don't want to show that. Fuck is that any personal information
[18219.79s -> 18229.87s]  on there? I hope not. Hold on to me. I don't know what I did. I screwed something up. But we got
[18229.87s -> 18236.19s]  when we get I'll be back tomorrow though. I promise you. We'll do well ended out on a good one here.
[18236.19s -> 18244.58s]  I'll see you guys. I don't know what's happening. This is fucking God damn it, man. I am starving.
[18246.82s -> 18257.81s]  Fuck dumb, stupid ass fucking stream. Drop frame stream close. Fuck. You know how much I
[18257.81s -> 18261.57s]  fucking ate today to do this and how much I had to get this ready. Everyone's expecting me to be
[18261.57s -> 18270.42s]  here. Looking over the chat. Yeah, great. What the fuck? What the fuck? Professional streamer
[18270.42s -> 18278.18s]  professional streamer, huh? If only they fucking knew. I'm upset too. They don't think I'm mad
[18278.18s -> 18324.67s]  about this too. Well, I did it. I prepared for it. So I'm gonna fucking do it. You like that one?
[18324.67s -> 18343.74s]  God fix my fucking internet tomorrow or I'll be pissed. We've been in a virus game like four
[18343.74s -> 18362.34s]  hours. I was using this stream to test the slime guy bit. What? I thought that was me doing that
[18362.34s -> 18389.76s]  again. It's going up. There's so many viruses. I have to pay my bills, dude. 20 bucks. I didn't
[18389.76s -> 18396.05s]  get any money from that stream. Course I did. Okay. 123 bucks. They look at thank you. They
[18396.05s -> 18400.45s]  supported him. They know he's got to pay his bills and I know he shakes around for their
[18400.45s -> 18431.12s]  entertainment. 500 fucking viruses. Look at him. Look at him. Look at him. Found him. Who is this
[18431.12s -> 18437.12s]  guy eating cheeseburgers? Why does he have bold cheeseburgers with the buns on the grill with
[18437.12s -> 18452.56s]  the buns? I feel like that's not good. I feel like that's not gonna be very good. That's Randy from
[18452.56s -> 18475.71s]  the trailer park boys. Okay. That was the wrong link. What is going on here? What the hell is
[18475.71s -> 18485.50s]  you? What is this? Did you make this? What is that image? Hey I got all the viruses are gone.
[18486.14s -> 18497.23s]  Now I gotta pay bills. What happens if you just don't pay them? Expected earnings. 386 bucks.
[18497.79s -> 18510.06s]  Payments are coming out tomorrow morning. Apply for partner. Come on. I had it. Look I got 137 subs.
[18511.71s -> 18521.02s]  44 bucks from ads. 165 live viewers concurrently. Come on. You need a thousand followers? What's up
[18521.02s -> 18534.59s]  with that? There were 500 people here on stream. I bring in the numbers. They can't get enough of
[18534.59s -> 18556.19s]  that. They want 400 concurrent. Fine. Buy some food. 800 follower Andy. Buy a bunch of burritos. They're
[18556.19s -> 18579.22s]  the most filling. Upload that stream. That's a good idea. Back to zootube. Go on fucking Zornhub or
[18579.22s -> 18596.80s]  riot. You're gonna have to riot. I'm afraid of seeing like a naked lady on it or something.
[18596.80s -> 18619.06s]  $50 burritos. Well $50 is in. I'm right there. Burrito delivery. Thank you. Zero energy. Twitch
[18619.06s -> 18638.70s]  mod said do it. They did? Hold on. They did. Wait. Wait. What do you mean a Twitch mod? You mean one
[18638.70s -> 18650.56s]  of my mods or do you mean a Twitch like staff member? Staff said it. Wait a minute. I want to
[18650.56s -> 18666.69s]  confirm this. Twitch staff just told me to do this. I didn't see it. Yep. Zornhub time. I just
[18666.69s -> 18671.81s]  okay. I just got confirmation from Twitch staff to go to Zornhub. Okay. I'm telling you. I just saw
[18671.81s -> 18713.10s]  it. I hope you didn't get hacked. What is this? This is my character? This is just like drawings
[18713.10s -> 18732.02s]  of people. How is this Zornhub? This is just like the cast. This is like a Wikipedia page for
[18732.58s -> 18751.94s]  any anime you could probably come up with. Okay. Click one. I just did. Keep going. Keep going.
[18751.94s -> 18764.42s]  I'm so tired. I need to rest. We did get confirmation from Twitch staff that like I
[18764.42s -> 18773.49s]  could do this. I'm not playing the fire anymore. I'm not holding a lighter up to my hand and going
[18773.49s -> 18781.78s]  ow ow. I'm not doing that shit. I'm not holding my hand up to a lighter. Just to see if it hurts.
[18782.34s -> 18795.41s]  That was 50 bucks. Great. Now I can't eat tomorrow. Boxbox said it was okay. Did he? He hates
[18795.41s -> 18820.22s]  anime. No. I just. I don't know. How many of these are there? What is this? And why do you
[18820.22s -> 18828.70s]  have the worst fucking website in 2020? It's just an infinite scroll with no text. No nothing. It's
[18828.70s -> 18848.06s]  just an infinite scroll of anime characters. It hurts my finger to do this. I'm scrolling as fast
[18848.06s -> 18860.64s]  as I can. All right. We've made it to the end. Cool, I guess. This is just like a League of
[18860.64s -> 18876.30s]  Legends character skins. Who is this? This is not worth $50. But I mean, I'm going to stream it real
[18876.30s -> 18890.58s]  quick. I'm going to stream this tomorrow. Dude, there was a raid. There was a raid. There's like
[18890.58s -> 18906.11s]  12,000 fucking people here right now. We had like 9,200 people like 40 minutes. Did Boxbox raid?
[18906.11s -> 18909.55s]  All right. Okay. Twitch staff, you got to look into this. No, this has nothing to do with you
[18909.55s -> 18913.87s]  guys. This is streamlabs. How come it doesn't say that Boxbox raided? The same shit happened.
[18913.87s -> 18920.85s]  Welcome, everybody. Thanks for the raid, Boxbox. Sorry that when you raided last. It almost happened
[18920.85s -> 18929.02s]  again, by the way. Almost happened again. Almost just somehow complete. Because it's like, hey,
[18929.02s -> 18936.37s]  Boxbox said it was okay. Oh, okay. Boxbox, I like him. I like Boxbox. Wait, Boxbox raid. Oh,
[18937.34s -> 18952.98s]  I idiot. 2k viewers left. That's what happens during a raid. You come to the stream, you go,
[18952.98s -> 18958.32s]  oh, cool. Then you leave. All right. Let's sleep. I'm going to get up tomorrow and we're going to
[18958.32s -> 18968.54s]  stream. I'm going to do a gameplay stream tomorrow. You forgot about the bills. I can't pay them. I
[18968.54s -> 18977.79s]  don't have enough money to pay the bills, man. Let's see. Oh, shit. Yeah, I do. I got my payout.
[18980.46s -> 18987.84s]  Pay bills and then stream Zornhub without a mic. Just me scrolling. We'll see how many subs we
[18987.84s -> 19005.63s]  can get. I was about to do it. I can't do it. All right. Mods. We're going to change the mods.
[19005.63s -> 19013.87s]  Ban rate balanced. We'll have four mods. Get the stream ready. Make sure I got, have I eaten?
[19014.59s -> 19019.79s]  I should do my toilet urgently. Yeah, I'm going to eat. Let's have some burritos
[19024.53s -> 19032.22s]  and let's go to the bathroom. Now, seriously, thanks. Welcome, guys. If any of you guys still
[19032.22s -> 19041.06s]  here. Probably not going to go that much longer, but welcome. Live tomorrow too. Boxbox is awesome.
[19041.06s -> 19045.70s]  If you do not follow Boxbox, go do it now or I'm going to be, I'm going to be incredibly fucking
[19045.70s -> 19058.75s]  irritated with you. Do you want that to happen? Okay. All right. Pay the bills. Here goes all my
[19058.75s -> 19073.01s]  money. Like that, huh? All right. Let's wait. We got to do a stream. I lost my internet boost.
[19073.01s -> 19080.50s]  I got to boost it again and we're going to run a bunch of ads. Do scratch tickets on stream. All
[19080.50s -> 19083.94s]  right. Yeah, that's not a bad idea. Let's scratch. We'll do scratch tickets. We'll do skin cases on
[19083.94s -> 19103.36s]  stream. Just a few of them. Find the boost. We're at six up. Okay. We're good. Let's put that to six
[19103.36s -> 19111.95s]  up. Six thousand up. Get off the ASMR category. We're going to do just chatting and we've got the
[19111.95s -> 19117.62s]  cam on. We're going to save these streams so we can upload them later and we're going to start
[19117.62s -> 19127.70s]  with Zornhub. We're going to just open it with Zornhub. Okay. 60 FPS Zornhub stream. Here we go.
[19131.18s -> 19142.21s]  Hey guys. Oh, we got some subs already. One of you guys know that today is going to be
[19144.08s -> 19149.60s]  an interesting stream today. Today I'm going to go mic-less so I'm not going to be talking.
[19150.85s -> 19156.56s]  What's the lie to my viewers? I'm just going to lie to them. Whatever. I just want to say everybody
[19156.56s -> 19160.32s]  that today we're going to do something a little different. Usually we play a game or I do something
[19160.32s -> 19166.32s]  IRL but today we're going to go to Zornhub. I'm going to turn the mic off and we're just going
[19166.32s -> 19173.90s]  to enjoy it together. Yeah, that'd be a beautiful streamer. Thank you. I reported this stream
[19173.90s -> 19178.46s]  because this makes me happy. That's kind of weird. But yeah, if you're not 18, I would say
[19178.46s -> 19181.82s]  please leave the stream now. I'm going to turn the mic off. I'm going to put some music on.
[19190.48s -> 19200.27s]  What terms of service? Switch to ASMR. Okay. You guys ready? I'm going to be quiet. I'll be
[19200.27s -> 19220.32s]  typing in here with you. We'll put some cool tunes on. I'm going to set it a little lighter.
[19224.46s -> 19229.78s]  Yeah, it's going to be a chat only stream. Yeah, I'll be in chat with you guys. Let's go over
[19229.78s -> 19273.60s]  some of these. Let's take a look. Here we go. Clever baby. Leave me the fuck alone. I said chat
[19273.60s -> 19327.02s]  only. Keckw. All right. Sub only mode. Chat only. There's another streamer on the agenda. Make a
[19327.02s -> 19344.38s]  boring statement. Tell constantly. What do you mean on the agenda? Change the outfit to extreme
[19344.38s -> 19354.75s]  energetic movements. Wait. Hold on. Okay. You didn't think I was going to be here today,
[19354.75s -> 19359.57s]  did you? Probably not a good thing to have right now. Probably not a very good thing to have right
[19359.57s -> 19371.98s]  now. Probably a very bad thing to do right now on the Zornhub stream. Okay. Probably not a great
[19371.98s -> 19383.04s]  thing to do. Let's run a couple of ads. Quick before the stream turns off, run five minutes of ads.
[19385.74s -> 19412.74s]  Don't. No. Like a band. Zand for zerking off. You didn't think you were going to save me.
[19414.00s -> 19424.10s]  47% is the blood to share. All right. Did I make any money? Not really. Oh, I get, actually that's
[19424.10s -> 19435.71s]  up in three days. I get 418 bucks. Well, it looks like I'm tired. That was a fun stream.
[19439.17s -> 19447.22s]  Uh, it's still fresh. I can eat it. People only want belly shaking. Yeah, I know. Can I do
[19447.22s -> 19451.62s]  anything? Can I do something different? Can I do some variety? Not allowed to do any variety.
[19451.62s -> 19455.86s]  You want me to just shake my stomach into the camera when I can't play Fortnite for an afternoon?
[19465.15s -> 19477.09s]  Oh damn. All right. Bingo. Oh yeah. I can afford another hard drive, which means you can download
[19477.09s -> 19486.94s]  Counter-Strike. I can finally do a Counter-Strike stream. Finally. I wanted to do a Counter-Strike
[19486.94s -> 19499.17s]  stream five hours ago. Hard drive. I'm tired. Just wait. Scratch tickets, scratch tickets,
[19499.81s -> 19530.30s]  I will. Just give me a sec. Not enough balance. What? There he is again. Oh no, it's Zookas.
[19530.30s -> 19533.58s]  All right. Here comes the hard drive. Let's sleep and let's put our new computer together
[19533.58s -> 19555.01s]  and be able to play Counter-Strike. Oh, I love when you get that box. There it is. Awesome.
[19555.57s -> 19569.50s]  And I'm going to do the super internet boost so I can download it faster. Two hard drives.
[19569.50s -> 19577.86s]  I'm going to do two graphics cards too. All right. Boot it up. Download Counter-Strike.
[19578.50s -> 19602.94s]  I didn't get the donos. Yeah, I collected them. Okay. Counter-Strike. Get it. Finally. Downloads.
[19602.94s -> 19615.79s]  Where is it? Oh, I can actually do it. Can we do both? Okay. We're going to get Counter-Strike
[19615.79s -> 19626.00s]  on D. Get that super boost internet shit. When do I get paid from Twitch? Stop saying Twitch.
[19628.13s -> 19642.13s]  Guys, I haven't left my house in a couple of months. I'm realizing. When was the last time
[19642.13s -> 19656.40s]  we drove the car? Making bank though. Yeah. Doing pretty good. I don't even know where the car is.
[19656.40s -> 19661.39s]  It's in the city somewhere. Isn't it parked in the city somewhere? Out of gas. It's still in
[19661.39s -> 19670.34s]  the other town. Yeah. I took an Uber back here. It's still in the city. It's too bad the Tinder
[19670.34s -> 19681.15s]  thing doesn't work. That would be really funny. Oof. I haven't gone to work in probably three
[19681.15s -> 19693.60s]  months. I've been up and fired. I just want to play it. I just want to see what it's like.
[19694.40s -> 19716.69s]  Yeah, you can drive in this game. It's a fully functioning car. Almost done. So I'm still
[19716.69s -> 19723.06s]  interested in this game. I'm still having fun. Tomorrow we have kind of a fuckface stream.
[19723.06s -> 19729.87s]  I'm probably going to play this again. I feel like there's at least another little bit of
[19729.87s -> 19740.86s]  content left to do. Tomorrow we're doing cartoon personality quizzes. I've mined, which is a
[19741.42s -> 19749.06s]  community-made game, which seems pretty fun. And I'm doing Chubby Bunny tomorrow. Tomorrow's
[19749.06s -> 19756.66s]  going to be weird. All right. I'm going to just, let's see. Let's open it. Counter-strike by
[19756.66s -> 19772.05s]  Vanv. Not Zalv. You're not going to make it Zalv. You're going to make it Vanv. Enter IP. I don't
[19772.05s -> 19790.30s]  know why this is scaring me. It's scaring the shit out of me. I don't know why. I don't have,
[19790.30s -> 19812.38s]  I don't have an IP. Matchmaking? Do 192.168.0.0. Oh, router. You don't actually play. It's going to
[19812.38s -> 19815.18s]  be the impossible game or something. It's going to be like a cube. You move around.
[19815.18s -> 19833.58s]  That's very loud. Dead game. Okay. Anti-terror or terror? Okay. Oh my fucking God. I can't believe
[19833.58s -> 19846.34s]  this. I have nine FPS. I need a better graphics card. He's at door. He's at door, door, door, door.
[19849.79s -> 19856.96s]  Got him. No, he got me. I got him too. I need a better, okay. How do I get a graphics card?
[19856.96s -> 19861.73s]  I'm rage-quitting. Graphics card. Where do I get one? How much money do I have? I get 500 bucks in
[19861.73s -> 19868.70s]  two days. I'm getting another graphics card. That's a good trade. All right. Let's turn the
[19868.70s -> 19886.98s]  stream on and just shake our stomach a little bit and you get money. This doesn't matter. Shit.
[19886.98s -> 19924.78s]  It doesn't matter. It just has to be live. Hello. Hey guys. Yeah, I'm going to have some food.
[19924.78s -> 19932.74s]  You guys want to watch a guy eat? Audience quality. You guys are, you guys are awesome.
[19932.74s -> 19939.79s]  Oh, let's turn the cam on. What are we thinking here? Cat wonders what movie you like.
[19951.25s -> 19964.78s]  Slow 10. What are you guys doing? Minus two. What's going on? Whatever. Bad joke. What joke?
[19965.66s -> 19988.82s]  Run ads. Cat talking about a popular person you don't like. I don't like. All right. Read,
[19988.82s -> 19999.26s]  read, read, read. I got to read. Run ads and read messages. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[20000.06s -> 20004.78s]  Thank you. Can you introduce a product that you don't like for money? I do everything for money.
[20005.34s -> 20010.03s]  There you go. Read that. Thanks for the sub. Thanks for the bits. Thanks for the money. Thanks
[20010.03s -> 20012.75s]  for the sub. Thanks for the money. Thanks for the sub. Thanks for the money. Thanks for the money.

[20158.35s -> 20180.29s]  I'm gonna do it for you guys. I'm gonna get... I got hacked and I'm gonna get an ace.
[20184.51s -> 20210.18s]  Mid hack. There was a plane? What? Wait, buy menu. Oh shit. Okay, hold on. Guys, I'm gonna get a
[20210.18s -> 20234.30s]  graphics card in a minute. I just shot his own friend. I didn't even kill that guy. All right.
[20234.30s -> 20251.70s]  All right. Cut the music. How much money did I make? Did I get paid from Twitch yet? How much is
[20251.70s -> 20266.54s]  a graphics card? Upload all these VODs. You're right. Holy shit. I'm wasting time there. A thousand
[20266.54s -> 20288.21s]  bucks coming in. All right. Upload. I think I have a video already here though, right? Where's juggles?
[20288.21s -> 20293.98s]  He got banned 140 times and finally they IP banned him. You think that guy has any idea how to do
[20293.98s -> 20307.46s]  that? I do anything how to get around that. 14 bucks. I'll take it. All right. Let's take a look
[20307.46s -> 20313.33s]  at graphics cards before I do my last stream where I open cases. We'll do scratch tickets.
[20313.33s -> 20318.77s]  We'll play blackjack and do one hand and then end the stream. I mean mine, not the one in the game.
[20330.16s -> 20349.25s]  Graphics cards. These are cheap. Zadion HD 770. What do I have right now? What's in there? Okay.
[20349.25s -> 20358.40s]  It's the MTX 950. That thing's junk. All right. I'm going to upgrade the fuck out of this.
[20360.43s -> 20377.47s]  That's junk. Do scratch tickets. They're expensive though. They're like 50 bucks.
[20378.11s -> 20390.85s]  All right. This is a 990. Oh, that's the one I have. ZRX 400. I'm going to go to sleep and
[20390.85s -> 20409.20s]  have money in my bank. Yeah. Let's go to bed. Leave the computer on. I need to eat too. Get
[20409.20s -> 20420.85s]  hacked while sleeping. Take out a huge loan and just do scratch. I don't want to just blow up the
[20420.85s -> 20430.45s]  rest of the game. Did I get paid? No, I didn't get paid yet. When are they going to pay me?
[20434.16s -> 20441.36s]  Gamble a loan. Do it. Guys, I can't save scum. Payment will be there tomorrow morning. It's
[20441.36s -> 20445.74s]  going to be 500 bucks and I'm going to do my Counter-Strike stream and then I'm going to
[20445.74s -> 20458.51s]  turn my stream off. I'm going to apply for partner too. 5,000 followers. That's going to
[20458.51s -> 20479.42s]  take ages. Oh yeah. I'll do 144p stream. A little dirty. It'll do. How does it smell dirty? It's
[20479.42s -> 20500.29s]  soda. You're fine. All right. Let's go to the bathroom. Do voice ASMR. Can I do that?
[20501.89s -> 20507.04s]  Might as well stream. What else am I going to do right now? ASMR. How do I do that?
[20780.61s -> 20806.83s]  See you later, suckers. Be lucky if I'm alive again. How much did I get? I didn't even claim it.
[20806.83s -> 20814.78s]  Oh, I got it. I didn't even burp for them either. No ad Andy. So many people left. So like,
[20816.70s -> 20824.85s]  what, four or 500 concurrent? There's only 200 there. People were actually leaving the stream.
[20824.85s -> 20833.89s]  That's so funny. I'm not going to do, what do you mean I'm going to do that one day?
[20842.45s -> 20853.17s]  What was the joke? Fuck you. Stop. I wasn't going to talk until I got a hundred dollars.
[20853.17s -> 20862.93s]  I didn't see any of them. I didn't. I just lost probably. I kept everything. This person
[20862.93s -> 20868.64s]  doesn't even care. All right. We're buying a graphics card tomorrow and I'm doing a CSGO
[20868.64s -> 20878.00s]  stream. Then I'm going to turn my stream off in real life. We're going to have a lot of money.
[20878.56s -> 20893.49s]  Time for bed. Wait, let's get a late night smack. Do 144p. I will. I didn't forget that.
[20894.13s -> 20907.34s]  I'm not even sure I can stream in 144p. I'm not, I don't think you can even do it. I'll try. Okay.
[20907.34s -> 20932.26s]  Let's buy that graphics card tomorrow morning. Go to bed. No, order food. All right. Good night.
[20932.26s -> 20946.45s]  Go to bed. No money. I'm getting like 500 bucks tomorrow morning. Uh, this stuff is trash. I got
[20946.45s -> 20963.20s]  to get rid of this. Am I going to pay for the card? Whoa. That was a lot. Okay. I got it. Don't
[20963.20s -> 20973.23s]  worry. I can sell this. There's a, there's a payment coming in of like 480 bucks tomorrow.
[20983.49s -> 21006.16s]  I store these and put them in the fridge. What about the emails? What about my emails?
[21006.16s -> 21026.72s]  It's like you're hearing about your damn emails. I just ate one. Why did I eat that burritos only?
[21026.72s -> 21044.46s]  Okay. Stop eating them before you put them in the fridge. You fucking dummy.
[21045.26s -> 21077.65s]  What the hell are you doing? All right. Sleep. Graphics card. Toilet. Graphics card. Oh, my money.
[21077.65s -> 21094.34s]  All right. Let's buy that card. Install it. 718 bucks. Hell yeah. I mean, if I'm going to be
[21094.34s -> 21105.15s]  live, I'm going to be here. It might as well be live. Ordering cards. All right. Do I want the,
[21105.79s -> 21129.42s]  do I go with the MTX go? How about, yeah, the MTX go. That's the one. Horrible reviews.
[21129.42s -> 21134.62s]  Just chatting. Here we're hanging out. Yeah. I'll play music for you guys.
[21135.50s -> 21160.82s]  When's the delivery get here? Hey, when are you going to play Xanima? Right. Yeah. I did say that,
[21160.82s -> 21169.82s]  didn't I? I got kind of absorbed into this game. I'm sorry. I couldn't help it. I'm getting
[21169.82s -> 21189.47s]  donations right now. Music's loud. There are people who say your conversation is boring.
[21189.47s -> 21206.72s]  Ban them. We're doing our money. Actually, kind of a lot came in. Popular person. Say I don't like
[21206.72s -> 21223.23s]  them. I hate all of you. Stupid herd. You will never be a good streamer. I saw the IP address.
[21223.23s -> 21231.10s]  You didn't see, I don't, what IP address? Change the subject. Talk about cats. Talk about shit.
[21231.10s -> 21237.95s]  I do that pretty frequently. So there's a lot of bands going out. Is this kind of,
[21237.95s -> 21245.39s]  does this happen in channels? I, I'm just, there's like 10 people banned a second.
[21245.39s -> 21260.74s]  Does this happen a lot? Waiting for that graphics card, man. I want it. Does that mean I'm a liar?
[21260.74s -> 21273.38s]  Is that the Pinocchio face? Can I get any, can I download any games? You can get Zephyr. Oh,
[21273.38s -> 21283.86s]  cyber prank. Childhood memory. I don't know. Cyber prank. Start download. Oh, I don't have
[21283.86s -> 21298.51s]  big enough hard drive. I can't do it. Goodbye. Time for bed. And I can't wait for my counter
[21298.51s -> 21311.47s]  strike stream to end all streams. I can't sleep yet. What can I do? Check emails. All right, fine.
[21311.47s -> 21329.58s]  Blender payment. Blender has issued payment. Yep. Blender, no reply. Thank you for applying
[21329.58s -> 21332.94s]  the partnership program. Our support team is reviewing your account. I'll give you the
[21332.94s -> 21341.58s]  necessary feedback within at least two business days. We did Valve Corp. We detected that you
[21341.58s -> 21345.34s]  left the rank match before Counter-Strike game ended. We have reduced your rank score.
[21345.34s -> 21353.94s]  Please be more respectful. I did that both. Oh, thank you for replying. Okay. Thank you for
[21353.94s -> 21368.29s]  replying. I'll meet the requirements recreated for partnerships. Whatever. Message is deleted.
[21369.49s -> 21400.50s]  What about some of these other apps that I never downloaded? I got them all. Yes. No, no 10. No 10,
[21400.50s -> 21405.06s]  no 10, no 10. No, I didn't mean to do that. No, there's no 10 under there. You don't have
[21405.06s -> 21421.41s]  Blackjack. Duh. I hate cards. All right, I got my graphics card coming in the mail tomorrow. I'm
[21421.41s -> 21441.52s]  happy even though I lost $250. Where's the ASMR? There. Happy? Eat something before bed?
[21441.52s -> 21470.77s]  This before bed? I need health. Zerk off and then go to bed. Zerk off. You know, I can say it because
[21470.77s -> 21477.63s]  it's not even a real word. Isn't that how, uh, wasn't there a TV show on TV that got away with
[21477.63s -> 21484.58s]  that for a while? They had swears in the universe. So instead of fuck, it was something, it was like,
[21484.58s -> 21496.62s]  it was like frack. What show is that? Firefly. Or like, grack. Battlestar Galactica. Yeah,
[21496.62s -> 21508.38s]  they had a whole list of like, just swears that they made up so they could say them on TV even
[21508.38s -> 21515.30s]  though they weren't real. And people in the show, if it was like, oh, come on, like, grack you,
[21515.30s -> 21519.44s]  it was like, excuse me. So it felt real. It felt like, holy shit, that was a big, that was a bad
[21519.44s -> 21537.28s]  word. Here it is. Look at this monster. Let's get a good look at this guy. Prepare. It's too big.
[21538.62s -> 21548.96s]  Prepare to dominate. The Zadeon HD 6450. I'm ready to dominate. This thing was, what, 500 bucks?
[21548.96s -> 21557.39s]  Throw this thing in the trash where it belongs. Wait, I'll sell that to that idiot. Let's do it.
[21557.39s -> 21578.94s]  Here we go. Are they both, two graphics cards? Oh, booted up. We're doing SLI. Imagine doing SLI
[21578.94s -> 21592.75s]  with a 1080 and like a GTX 240M mobile card. I don't think that would work very well. Let's test
[21592.75s -> 21617.74s]  it out on a strike. Hey, guys. Guys, we got, hey, hey, new gear. Let's check this out. New gear.
[21617.74s -> 21625.49s]  I'm ready to play. Let's see if I can get that ace. Welcome to the stream, everybody. Last time
[21625.49s -> 21637.89s]  you saw this, I was playing at nine FPS. Not anymore. Look at that loading time. It's like cut
[21637.89s -> 21663.73s]  in half. Fight. What the fuck? 15 FPS? Where's the bottleneck? This is like a $600 graphics card.
[21663.73s -> 21678.77s]  Where's the bottleneck? It's the CPU. I need a better CPU now. Do you see like the four donations
[21678.77s -> 21683.25s]  I just got? That's people spamming me saying, omega lol idiot doesn't understand computers and
[21683.25s -> 21696.11s]  bottlenecks. I clicked outside the window. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out.
[21696.11s -> 21704.94s]  Behind. Behind. Behind. Behind. Behind. Stunning. Stunning. All right. They're down. They're down.
[21704.94s -> 21713.86s]  They're down. They're down. They're down. All right. I'm going banana. Maybe a quad box. I'm going
[21713.86s -> 21760.43s]  banana. Nobody here. People wonder. I don't care. Get the fuck out of here. Well, that was just the
[21760.43s -> 21775.65s]  monitor. The computer is still on. Flush this fucking thing. Rage quit. Yeah, whatever. Rage
[21775.65s -> 21784.59s]  quit. That was my first stream. I get hacked every day. I get hacked every day. I get hacked
[21784.59s -> 21800.30s]  every single day. When is that guy going to get bored? All right. That's the end of my stream.
[21800.30s -> 21806.77s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow for cartoon character personality quizzes. Weird to say that out loud,
[21806.77s -> 21816.00s]  but I am. Hive Mind and Chubby Bunny. Let's try to turn the stream down to 144p. See what happens.
[21816.08s -> 21822.78s]  I got to remember to... Okay. Please remind me in the offline chat tomorrow to revert this.
[21829.79s -> 21832.99s]  Actually, let me do the... Let me just end the stream and show the credits and everything,
[21832.99s -> 21835.15s]  because this is going to be a joke. It's going to have to turn off immediately.
[21841.12s -> 21845.76s]  Please remind me. I don't want to have to turn this on and have to turn the stream off tomorrow,
[21845.76s -> 21852.96s]  because I fucked it up. Thanks for watching, guys. We'll see you tomorrow. Starting probably
[21852.96s -> 21866.03s]  around 2 p.m. Pacific. This game was surprisingly very fun. I thought this was going to be a thing
[21866.03s -> 21877.36s]  that we did for maybe 40 minutes, but it was pretty good. It was pretty fun. Thanks for watching,
[21877.36s -> 21887.78s]  guys. I'll probably play it a little more. At least enough to get partner. Not tomorrow,
[21887.78s -> 21899.12s]  though. We'll do that probably later this week. Play it tomorrow? We've got a plan tomorrow,
[21899.12s -> 21910.83s]  though, man. Are you ever going to play Mafia 1? Those of you that might be a little new to the
[21910.83s -> 21919.76s]  stream, the limit that is on if I stream a game again is usually about six days. If I play a game
[21919.76s -> 21927.87s]  and I don't play it within six to seven days, you're never going to see it again. I've come
[21927.87s -> 21936.93s]  to terms with that. What about Saw? Well, hold on. The only reason why I played Saw again is because
[21936.93s -> 21942.70s]  I have Saw 2, and we needed to conclude the first game before we played the second one.
[21942.70s -> 21952.21s]  That's the only reason why I played it again and beat it on stream. Yeah, I'll do House Flipper VR.
[21954.05s -> 21957.57s]  We'll do that next week, though. I'm not going to do it at lunch. I thought I was going to.
[21957.57s -> 21968.27s]  Grass Head Tooie? It's been seven days. Don't think so. Thanks for the subs, guys. There actually
[21968.27s -> 21974.64s]  were a lot of community subs, and no joking around in the fake game, in the real life here,
[21976.29s -> 21985.34s]  so thank you for those. Let me see. I want to make sure I didn't miss anything huge before I
[21986.14s -> 21997.94s]  do this. Let me just see, and then I'm going to do the 144p thing. Okay, hold on. What is 144p?
[21999.20s -> 22014.08s]  What bitrate is that? 144p is what resolution? 700 bitrate, and it's 700 144p.
[22014.88s -> 22025.12s]  It's 256 by 144. Oh, Jesus Christ, that's going to look terrible. 256 by 144.
[22028.32s -> 22032.40s]  Okay, you do realize I'm only going to be live doing this for like 30 seconds before I leave,
[22032.40s -> 22043.39s]  and thanks Boxbox for the raid, too. Make sure I didn't miss that one. I'll be right back.
[22044.11s -> 22049.07s]  Hang tight. I'm going to come back at 256 by 144 at 700 bitrate. This is going to be stupid.
[22049.07s -> 22054.16s]  I might not even be able to go live. 256 by 144.
