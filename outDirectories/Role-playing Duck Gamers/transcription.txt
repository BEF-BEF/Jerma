[0.00s -> 13.12s]  What the hell are you doing? You dropped your burger on the ground there.
[13.12s -> 15.12s]  You dropped your burger on the ground.
[15.12s -> 19.12s]  Hey, have you ever seen that movie Super Mario Bros. 2?
[19.12s -> 26.23s]  It's pretty cool. You see the main character, Super Mario, he goes like this.
[26.23s -> 28.23s]  And he gets into the... where's the game?
[28.23s -> 30.23s]  That doesn't even hurt. That doesn't even hurt.
[30.23s -> 33.61s]  Where's the gun?
[33.61s -> 35.68s]  Give me that gun.
[35.68s -> 39.24s]  Give me this gun. Give me that gun. I win.
[39.24s -> 41.24s]  You really like this joke.
[42.24s -> 43.24s]  You got me.
[43.24s -> 46.24s]  Today is your unlucky day, motherfucker.
[46.24s -> 52.38s]  Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Gotcha. Gotcha, motherfucker.
[53.38s -> 56.94s]  I don't think that's going to stop being funny.
[57.94s -> 62.75s]  What's wrong? Having some trouble? Come on now. What do you got?
[62.75s -> 64.75s]  You got a pistol. I got a pistol. I'm going to shoot you with this pistol.
[64.75s -> 67.25s]  Duck. Jump.
[68.25s -> 70.81s]  Get wrecked. I mean, get wrecked.
[73.84s -> 79.84s]  It's actually kind of hard. It's hard to hit B and make the mouth open and play the game at the same time.
[79.84s -> 83.45s]  Watch out. I got a shotgun. I got one too. I'm going to blast you.
[83.45s -> 85.75s]  You going to blast me? I'm going to throw it.
[85.75s -> 87.75s]  You think you're going to blast me?
[87.75s -> 89.75s]  Well, I'm not going to now. I don't have a shotgun anymore.
[89.75s -> 91.63s]  Come chase me.
[91.63s -> 94.19s]  What?
[94.19s -> 95.19s]  Come chase me?
[95.19s -> 97.19s]  I don't know. Come chase me.
[97.19s -> 99.19s]  You're the one with the gun. Chase me.
[100.82s -> 103.82s]  We're going to do it just like they used to do in the old times.
[103.82s -> 105.99s]  Back to back. Ten paces.
[105.99s -> 109.94s]  Turn around. Okay.
[109.94s -> 112.12s]  In ten paces. Go.
[112.12s -> 117.12s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[117.12s -> 120.54s]  Die.
[120.54s -> 122.74s]  Miscalculation.
[122.74s -> 124.98s]  My die was like eight syllables.
[124.98s -> 128.33s]  That's the fucking Earthworm. I just found the Earthworm gym gun, dude.
[128.33s -> 130.33s]  Dude, look. Look. Look. This is the gun from Earthworm gym.
[130.33s -> 133.27s]  Cool, huh? Cool.
[133.27s -> 136.27s]  Duck Game. On Steam. Currently part of the Steam sale.
[136.27s -> 139.27s]  Pick it up today. You're going to have fun with all your friends.
[139.27s -> 144.96s]  Like this guy. He's my friend. But is he really though? I don't know. Could he be? I have no idea.
[144.96s -> 146.96s]  Friends. I love friends.
[146.96s -> 149.96s]  This whole thing. This whole thing sucks.
[149.96s -> 159.01s]  You know, when I sit up here and stare at this red beam, I think about my life and where I've been and where I'll go.
[159.01s -> 165.33s]  And what? Aliens. Are we the aliens to aliens?
[171.78s -> 173.78s]  I just want to watch the world burn.
[173.78s -> 176.14s]  That's a Batman quote.
[176.14s -> 179.34s]  I wonder how long this recording has been.
[179.34s -> 185.19s]  Hello there. Welcome to the shoe shop.
[185.19s -> 189.43s]  Okay, so I have this pair of shoes for only $12.
[189.43s -> 192.46s]  I'll take them.
[192.46s -> 193.46s]  Okay, good.
[193.46s -> 199.58s]  Yes, my old nemesis. The hamburger head. Those of you that know who he is.
[199.58s -> 202.89s]  He's a dastardly villain. And he must be destroyed.
[202.89s -> 205.77s]  We have to come down here.
[205.77s -> 209.26s]  Yeah, I know. I will eventually. I'm doing my monologue.
[209.26s -> 215.83s]  It's incredibly important to the story arc of my character.
[215.83s -> 220.26s]  I seriously don't know how many more of these I can even tolerate as a person.
[220.26s -> 222.26s]  That's the moon gun.
[222.26s -> 224.26s]  I'm going to catch it in my mouth.
[224.26s -> 227.27s]  No, no, don't die.
[231.27s -> 236.56s]  There he is. Ladies and gentlemen, that's the guy that had my character.
[236.56s -> 239.56s]  I have to go to kill that guy. It's part of my character storyline.
[239.56s -> 246.94s]  Bastard.
[246.94s -> 252.50s]  All right, so your first day on a job here at Edwards Construction.
[252.50s -> 255.50s]  You got to be careful.
[255.50s -> 259.84s]  Told you to be careful.
[259.84s -> 264.84s]  And that's when she told me to go to school.
[264.84s -> 267.84s]  She wanted to see me.
[267.84s -> 270.84s]  Well, you're really fucking this up, aren't you?
[270.84s -> 276.15s]  Are we the aliens to that planet?
[276.15s -> 280.40s]  Could be. Makes sense, in my opinion.
[280.40s -> 285.07s]  Although a more existential way to look at it is probably like this.
[288.40s -> 295.61s]  Can you believe Carol? Carol in accounting.
[295.61s -> 298.61s]  Man, she really gave me the ride.
[298.61s -> 301.49s]  I have to get back to work.
[301.49s -> 304.79s]  Yeah, you do. I don't know why you've been doing that.
[304.79s -> 311.58s]  Seems kind of expensive.
[311.58s -> 313.88s]  All right, I'm ready.
[313.88s -> 324.76s]  Okay, I'm going to catch it in my mouth.
[324.76s -> 329.56s]  Hey, I just want to say congratulations on being number one.
[329.56s -> 331.56s]  You don't talk to me.
[331.56s -> 332.56s]  You deserve that trophy.
[332.56s -> 334.56s]  You're second place. I win.
