[0.31s -> 17.70s]  Hello there, ladies and gentlemen. It's Grampa here. And today, I've got some Dishonored for you. It's a fantastic game.
[17.70s -> 26.70s]  I actually, I haven't played one second of the game, so I don't know if it's good or not. But I'm just gonna say it's good for the purpose of the fucking video.
[26.70s -> 33.06s]  So let's do it, huh? I've been drinking all morning in preparation for this game. So let's have some fun!
[35.14s -> 39.14s]  See, the cool part about this game is you can talk to everybody.
[40.14s -> 45.14s]  You're all talking at the same time, though. You shut the fuck up. I'm trying to listen to this guy.
[46.14s -> 50.95s]  I'm drinking this. That was his, I think. He doesn't even care.
[51.95s -> 63.52s]  Oh, hello there, Suzy. Look at this beautiful woman. Is this my wife? God, I hope so. Look at you.
[63.52s -> 69.52s]  I hope that one of the other cities had dealt with this before. Knew of some cure. This news is very bad.
[70.52s -> 72.52s]  At the breaking point.
[73.52s -> 75.52s]  Cowards. They're going to block you.
[76.52s -> 78.52s]  They'll wait to see if the plague turns this city into a graveyard.
[78.52s -> 80.52s]  Yeah, that sucks. I know, me too.
[80.52s -> 84.42s]  Wait, what? What happened?
[84.42s -> 85.42s]  Don't worry, darling.
[85.42s -> 87.42s]  Everything's fine. Your mother's fine.
[87.42s -> 89.42s]  Wait, where are the guards? Who sent them away?
[89.42s -> 90.42s]  What do you mean?
[90.42s -> 91.42s]  Who sent them away?
[91.42s -> 92.42s]  I am the guard.
[92.42s -> 94.69s]  What? What are they doing?
[94.69s -> 95.69s]  What the hell is that?
[95.69s -> 96.69s]  Oh, it's ninjas.
[96.69s -> 98.69s]  How am I going to fight the ninjas now?
[98.69s -> 99.69s]  Come on, left clickers, attack.
[99.69s -> 100.69s]  All right, don't worry, sweetie.
[100.69s -> 102.69s]  I got you. Get the fuck away from here.
[102.69s -> 103.69s]  Come on. Come at me.
[104.69s -> 105.69s]  I got to come around this corner.
[112.69s -> 116.18s]  Okay, so the game wants me to be stealthy right here.
[117.18s -> 120.18s]  But I say, nope, I'm just going to run in and start slicing.
[121.18s -> 123.18s]  Because, you know, are they really going to kill me?
[123.18s -> 124.18s]  Three versus one?
[124.18s -> 126.18s]  I'm supposed to be a superhuman son of a bitch.
[126.18s -> 127.18s]  We'll see what happens.
[127.18s -> 128.18s]  Let's go in.
[128.18s -> 129.55s]  Hey, buddy.
[130.55s -> 131.55s]  Eat that, that's your neck.
[131.55s -> 133.55s]  Oh, sorry, did I cut off your balls?
[133.55s -> 134.55s]  What about you too?
[134.55s -> 137.55s]  Jeez, stealth, I will never use stealth ever.
[137.55s -> 139.55s]  I just killed this whole room in two seconds.
[142.20s -> 144.20s]  Okay, I don't know what this guy's doing,
[144.20s -> 146.20s]  but it is freaking me out right now.
[146.20s -> 149.20s]  I'm seriously going to start fucking hallucinating.
[149.20s -> 151.20s]  This guy has just been doing this the whole time.
[152.57s -> 153.57s]  What are you doing, man?
[153.57s -> 154.87s]  What are you doing?
[154.87s -> 156.87s]  Please stop doing that.
[157.87s -> 160.11s]  Going through the sewers, having tons of fun.
[160.11s -> 161.11s]  Going through...
[161.11s -> 162.11s]  What the hell is this?
[163.11s -> 165.67s]  Oh my God.
[166.67s -> 167.67s]  Are those rats?
[169.30s -> 172.92s]  Oh, oh, they're just bones and muscle now.
[173.92s -> 175.22s]  Oh, hold on.
[175.22s -> 176.22s]  Where's the box?
[176.22s -> 177.22s]  Is this a horror game?
[177.22s -> 181.22s]  Is this one of those horror games that takes like an hour before it starts to scare you?
[181.22s -> 183.22s]  I'm not playing this fucking game.
[183.22s -> 184.22s]  Doc's here.
[184.22s -> 185.22s]  No, no way.
[185.22s -> 186.22s]  I'm not playing a horror game.
[186.22s -> 188.22s]  I'm not playing that.
[188.22s -> 190.87s]  And the chase is on.
[190.87s -> 191.87s]  Got to get out of here.
[191.87s -> 192.87s]  Come on, come on.
[192.87s -> 193.87s]  The music means you got to run fast.
[193.87s -> 195.87s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[195.87s -> 196.87s]  Actually, I heard people behind me.
[196.87s -> 198.87s]  I think there's a couple of assholes behind me.
[198.87s -> 199.87s]  Hold on.
[199.87s -> 200.87s]  Stay here.
[200.87s -> 201.87s]  Stay here.
[201.87s -> 202.87s]  Let's go.
[202.87s -> 203.87s]  Come on.
[203.87s -> 204.87s]  I'm going to kill you.
[204.87s -> 207.87s]  You're going to get a sword in your face.
[207.87s -> 208.87s]  See you later.
[208.87s -> 209.87s]  I blocked that.
[209.87s -> 210.87s]  Come on.
[210.87s -> 211.87s]  Try harder.
[211.87s -> 212.87s]  You guys are terrible.
[212.87s -> 213.87s]  How ab...
[213.87s -> 215.87s]  Who brings a fucking gun to a knife fight?
[215.87s -> 218.87s]  We were having a genuine knife fight.
[218.87s -> 219.87s]  And you brought...
[219.87s -> 220.87s]  You bring out a gun.
[220.87s -> 221.87s]  Where's my gun?
[221.87s -> 222.87s]  Oh, I didn't...
[222.87s -> 223.87s]  Where's my machine gun?
[223.87s -> 225.87s]  How come I don't have one and you do?
[225.87s -> 227.11s]  God damn it.
[227.11s -> 229.31s]  Whatever.
[229.31s -> 232.32s]  I got to go to the store anyways.
