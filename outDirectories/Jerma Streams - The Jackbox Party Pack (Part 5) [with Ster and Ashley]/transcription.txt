[1.27s -> 19.90s]  Okay, hello. I had to take care of Otto. Kill him? Take care of Otto. This game's kind of loud.
[19.90s -> 33.48s]  There we go. All right, so what do you guys want to do? I don't know. Do you want to do? Oh,
[33.48s -> 45.00s]  we'll go open it. Open up my stream. I'm opening it. Okay. It's like you're getting tea. Not for
[46.58s -> 48.42s]  mine. Mine won't start for some reason.
[60.84s -> 66.01s]  Well, it's a good to do window capture or fuck it. We'll just do this.
[66.65s -> 80.50s]  It's already here. All right, so we have trivia murder party. A serial killer is running an absurd
[80.50s -> 87.13s]  trivia game out of the family run murder hotel he grew up in. Can you survive? Role models. Excuse
[87.13s -> 94.42s]  me. Did you say family run murder hotel? Yes, that is that is correct. That is role models.
[94.42s -> 98.10s]  Everybody's somebody. So who are you? The planner, the flake, the sassy one.
[98.66s -> 107.30s]  Step into the lab and find out. We just do them all. Let's start a trivia murder party too. All
[107.30s -> 115.00s]  right. Trivia murder party too is what we're starting with. Wait, it's coming. I'm going to
[115.00s -> 131.46s]  give you guys. I'm going to tell you guys the secret code. Oh, if it'll load. Is it going to
[131.46s -> 141.85s]  load? There we go. All right. I need to set up some stuff. Audience full screen. Turn it down
[141.85s -> 147.91s]  a little. That's it. Could be a little loud. All right. Now I have to do this. I do the hide
[149.96s -> 157.83s]  subtitles. Max players. Eight room code hiding. I got it. Don't worry. Okay.
[158.79s -> 165.91s]  Filter US centric questions. Reduce the number of US questions. What? Why? Require Twitch.
[166.47s -> 179.96s]  Require players to be logged into Twitch. I kind of need the tutorials. I don't need extended
[179.96s -> 189.70s]  timers. Okay. So now this thing is, let me just do this for a second. Hold on. Hold on. Everybody,
[189.70s -> 194.50s]  everybody relax. Okay. I'm going to run bathroom. Go to the bathroom. Go to the bath. Go get tea.
[194.50s -> 208.06s]  Cause something, something's messed up over here. I need to look at this. This shouldn't be doing
[208.06s -> 232.82s]  this. What's going on? Turn that off. Why is it doing this? So is this trivia about murderers
[232.82s -> 238.90s]  or are they going to murder us if we get them wrong? This trivia is about surviving. I don't
[238.90s -> 250.41s]  know. I'm bringing up murderpedia just in case. Is that being captured? It's glitching out of it.
[250.41s -> 254.36s]  All right. I think I got it. I got it. I got it. All right. That should be fine. All right.
[257.85s -> 264.47s]  Let me make sure this is going to work. All right. I have a room code here for you guys in a second.
[265.19s -> 273.91s]  In just a moment when he's ready. I got to break this down. So then I can put it in the discord.
[277.69s -> 284.58s]  This code is going to be in the sub discord. Those of you subs, it's going to be there in
[284.58s -> 295.45s]  just a second after they get it. I'm ready. He's done. I will just tell you what it is.
[295.45s -> 301.82s]  Wait, is he streaming still? No, no. All right. I'm going to mute and I'm going to tell you what
[301.82s -> 307.34s]  it is. Are you ready? Where do we type it in? I was in the back. You go to jackbox.tv
[310.07s -> 321.34s]  and you are going to write in the room code. Okay. Ready? Yes. I'm about to mute.
[321.42s -> 328.76s]  But I have to get in first here. The code is I remember this. I have to get in first
[330.94s -> 337.10s]  like on my phone. I have to get in. I remember the shit. Well, like another browser, right? Yeah.
[338.14s -> 342.76s]  I fucked this up last time we did this. They would try. They've nobody said anything
[342.76s -> 362.41s]  trying to get me to fuck this up. All right. The code is. Okay. Room requires Twitch login.
[362.41s -> 368.70s]  Yeah. You have to be connected to Twitch. Yeah. You're not. Yeah. I got it. Yeah. You did. There's
[368.70s -> 373.50s]  a little dropdown that says Twitch. You clicked a little top left dropdown and click on the Twitch
[373.50s -> 379.58s]  button and you should be able to log in. Yeah. Okay. Now what was the room password? The room
[379.58s -> 399.56s]  password is going to work. I'm in. So now, Hey discord, Hey discord, you're going to want to
[399.56s -> 406.89s]  type in. Here we go. Same joke again. Yeah. You'd be doing the same thing again. Just the same joke
[406.89s -> 418.98s]  again. Go for it. That's all I have. Some people have gotten in. Bye. And there's still some slots.
[418.98s -> 430.49s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. No, there's not. Join it. There was like a little
[430.49s -> 441.22s]  bookshelf thing. MCFN on jackbox.tv. You can participate in the game. Oh, your little dude
[441.22s -> 452.73s]  looks like Easter. Like a total nerd. Ready? Everybody's in. Okay. Sit back and relax. Where's
[452.73s -> 479.29s]  the everybody's in button? All right. We've got MCFN join it. What about me? Yeah. I feel like
[479.29s -> 484.25s]  my browser is in control of this because I'm the one that enabled it to start and I have a skip
[484.25s -> 490.09s]  button for this. I think, yeah, you are. I don't know how I got VIP. You got VIP because you got
[490.09s -> 497.69s]  in first and I didn't. As long as one of us is out there. Okay. Oh yeah. I'm in control.
[501.16s -> 512.07s]  This is your wake up call. Welcome to Trivia Murder Party. Those free vacation coupons you
[512.07s -> 517.19s]  received in the mail were a trick luring you into a game with deadly consequences.
[517.19s -> 530.15s]  How are there 4,700 people in the audience and 3,500 people watching? What is going on?
[531.27s -> 534.15s]  Whose memoir is titled? Is everyone hanging out without me?
[535.11s -> 542.14s]  Use your device to answer the question. Whose memoir is titled? Is everyone hanging out with me?
[542.86s -> 549.18s]  Who are these people? I know who. Two of these people. I know one.
[554.44s -> 561.00s]  And we die if we don't answer this. In the correct answer. Who got the question right?
[561.00s -> 569.99s]  I got that wrong. The rest of you come with me. American questions off. Why would we do this?
[570.63s -> 576.87s]  The three of us are Americans. I don't want to be American. The hairdryer is broken. Sorry.
[576.87s -> 583.83s]  I can't believe there's 7,000 people in the audience. I know. This one's real straightforward.
[584.63s -> 591.03s]  A player who rolls the highest will die. What? But we've got some help to make this more interesting.
[592.31s -> 597.45s]  You have an extra die that you can give to whoever you want to make their odds worse.
[597.45s -> 606.74s]  I didn't know who wrote that memoir. Oh shit. I need to read more books. Well, good luck, Star.
[607.54s -> 617.22s]  More celebrity memoirs. The player with the highest total dies. Oh no. Awesome sauce is dead.
[622.62s -> 633.91s]  That's the worst way to die. Kill bonus. Holy shit. Wow. We have 15,000 people in the audience today.
[633.91s -> 639.19s]  Don't freak out. But you're a ghost now. Keep playing and you just might steal some
[639.67s -> 648.47s]  life force and win the game. Oh, by the way, the audience is a player. Now you can join
[648.47s -> 653.91s]  the audience. Whatever. It's like super low pressure. This is just fucking up everything.
[656.70s -> 665.26s]  Let's keep moving. Did I not get name dropped in the song? Oh, I know this one. I know this one.
[666.22s -> 668.30s]  I heard that shit. I know the song.
[672.65s -> 692.34s]  Do I get points for answering it instantly? Time's running out. I don't even know who made
[692.34s -> 698.26s]  this song or what the song is. It's like a song for a Girl Scout camp. It's like a little kid song.
[698.26s -> 705.88s]  Oh, I got it wrong. Fuck. Why do I know this? Because I have a shitload of nieces and nephews.
[705.88s -> 713.46s]  I hope you're good with instructions. Follow as many rules as you can before time runs out.
[714.10s -> 721.90s]  The player who follows the fewest rules correctly dies. The rules are already on your device. Go,
[721.90s -> 730.98s]  go. The most disobedient player dies. Star, what's going on, Star? Star, what are you doing?
[731.70s -> 734.82s]  I'm so confused. There's not a lot for me to do during this game.
[734.82s -> 753.38s]  I guess I'll update my LinkedIn account. Almost out of rules time. Star, I didn't realize it was
[753.38s -> 774.63s]  timed. I didn't realize. I voted for Star. I wrote this next question just for you. If you get it
[774.63s -> 780.39s]  right, I will punish everyone else. Wait, what? Where do I keep more than half my bones?
[781.19s -> 785.35s]  How come this person gets to punish everybody? And I guess the audience can answer too.
[785.35s -> 791.75s]  What, me old bones? What are these questions? I think you have to pay attention. I think he
[791.75s -> 796.55s]  said like a line. Well, I have to stream mute it because then I'll hear myself. This isn't fair.
[796.55s -> 807.24s]  Time's almost up. I can't do like a delay. Did you get the question right?
[809.10s -> 812.62s]  You succeeded. There's subtitles. I can't read. The rest will suffer.
[814.14s -> 821.74s]  Yeah, I got subtitles on. Oh no. It's the classic game Chalices. I've given each safe player a
[821.74s -> 830.95s]  poison pellet. Pick a chalice to drop your poison in. What do you mean? This is freaking me out.
[835.22s -> 842.49s]  Now it's your turn to play. Pick a chalice to drink from. Oh no. Drinking from a cup with a
[842.49s -> 848.97s]  poison pellet will kill you if you trust doctors. Drink, drink, drink. Yeah, I mean you have to go
[850.41s -> 857.96s]  now. Let's see what everyone drank. A big skull. Yeah. No, I'm not going to put the poison in the
[857.96s -> 870.38s]  skull. That's too obvious. You know, that's why I clicked. I'm safe. A clever. It was too obvious.
[870.38s -> 874.46s]  That's why I didn't poison it. Why there's 17,000 people in the audience game part?
[874.46s -> 878.06s]  Because somebody has like four computers turned down and they're going to burn down their house.
[878.94s -> 883.98s]  Next question. Yeah, bot farm. Bot farming there is somewhere. What's inside a down comforter?
[883.98s -> 900.15s]  I don't know. That's a pretty easy question. Cigarette butts. It's not even out.
[906.36s -> 919.85s]  Who picked this? Everybody. One of you is still alive. Packing peanuts. What's the significance
[919.85s -> 925.05s]  in me being dead? I can't play anymore. I think you can influence the game. Ah, the lost art of
[925.05s -> 932.25s]  letter writing. I'm going to dictate a message to you. Write down as much of what I say as you can.
[933.05s -> 937.93s]  Everyone else will be typing too. And if anyone does a better job than you, you die.
[940.49s -> 947.77s]  Get ready. What are we doing? Starting letter now. Dear local action news team. Do you take requests?
[948.57s -> 954.41s]  I would like to see more of this future story. What are we doing? That share positive images.
[954.81s -> 960.25s]  And last segments about the crimes that I have committed. What's happening? Just wait. Viewers
[960.25s -> 969.75s]  are tired of all the sad stories I am directly responsible for. Okay. Time's up. Now let me just
[969.75s -> 974.23s]  see what we have here with a quick scan. What's the result? No, you tricked me. You were supposed
[974.23s -> 977.83s]  to type out what that said. But did anyone do better than you? We were supposed to type that
[977.83s -> 984.33s]  whole thing out. You got outperformed. That's not even close to what I said. Again, I can't hear
[984.33s -> 999.19s]  anything that's being said on the screen. I hear this guy talking. Oh God. It's all right. I'm
[999.19s -> 1009.67s]  still doing all right. Dead last. We're good. Let's try another one. I like what has three hearts.
[1010.79s -> 1013.91s]  You could be good on that one. You guys confused me so I stopped.
[1014.71s -> 1028.97s]  This is a trick question, I think, is it? Almost out of time. A lobster doesn't want lobster.
[1034.30s -> 1046.81s]  This. I want to show you something. This is the one with the big creepy mirror.
[1048.55s -> 1053.75s]  The ghost of my aunt Mildred loves to write words on mirrors. Yeah. She has her own consistent
[1053.75s -> 1059.59s]  handwriting. Now aunt Mildred is going to write a different word. What? But so will everyone else.
[1060.23s -> 1064.23s]  Draw a word on the mirror and maybe you'll trick someone into thinking it's aunt Mildred's.
[1064.47s -> 1072.55s]  I let the drawing begin. What the fuck attention to draw word here and try to spot my auntie.
[1077.11s -> 1080.47s]  Oh, I got it already. I got it.
[1085.51s -> 1088.79s]  Everyone's going to write some stupid nonsense words to choose from.
[1089.27s -> 1092.55s]  Oh, I got it. Type the word that aunt Mildred wrote or you die.
[1099.50s -> 1103.58s]  You can tell because aunt Mildred did not write sucks. With the real aunt Mildred,
[1103.58s -> 1110.54s]  please stand up. Yeah, we're good. We're safe. Oh, you got it. Oh, man. Mirrors are such bad luck
[1110.54s -> 1120.73s]  for me. I wonder if this is more or less ghost than you find in most elevators. Makes you think.
[1127.90s -> 1131.98s]  Let's keep moving. I want a germa to die. According to his website,
[1131.98s -> 1136.30s]  what does my boy Bob Vila recommend I use to get the blood out of the lobby carpet?
[1137.42s -> 1142.06s]  This is this old house. This old house with Bob Vila. My father used to watch the show every
[1142.06s -> 1157.46s]  fucking day. Time's almost up. I don't think I got this right though. It feels like boomer questions.
[1157.46s -> 1169.99s]  It is. Who picked this? I was going to pick that too. Everyone is wrong. Time for consequences.
[1170.79s -> 1179.16s]  I'll remember that though. Yeah. Good advice. I have a lot of scratch tickets. What a quirky
[1179.16s -> 1184.20s]  last minute gift. Yeah, there's going to be a scratch and find three dollar signs to live.
[1184.20s -> 1189.32s]  Do you want me to screen share to you on discord? I'll give you cash for every dollar sign you find.
[1189.32s -> 1195.24s]  But if you scratch off even one skull, you die. If it doesn't mess you up. Shouldn't. I'm reading
[1195.88s -> 1199.08s]  get to scratching some titles and everything now like a good boy.
[1203.94s -> 1207.22s]  Come on, you could scratch more. Oh, I think I'm dead.
[1211.93s -> 1220.62s]  I already scratched. What? The contest is almost over.
[1225.50s -> 1233.19s]  How the fuck did you do that? That's bullshit. No way. No way. You've got. That's wall.
[1233.19s -> 1242.94s]  Act. You're all dead. Only one of you is still alive. I'm dying too. It makes it better.
[1246.14s -> 1257.70s]  Now, let me see if I can do this. Congrats on making it here. I'm going to give you a category
[1260.06s -> 1265.58s]  books written in the first person. Tap each answer that fits the category and then press submit.
[1266.46s -> 1275.21s]  Does that work? You just mute it. Time is almost up. It's really laggy. Let's see the right answer.
[1275.21s -> 1280.42s]  Yeah, too laggy. You move forward one space for each correct answer.
[1283.62s -> 1289.38s]  Yeah. Well, then I guess you guys can see the code. Did you think it was going to be just you?
[1290.58s -> 1296.34s]  That's cute. If it goes, then they can try to escape and win the game.
[1297.14s -> 1302.74s]  Here's everyone's next question and they get a third chance to help them catch up to you.
[1307.34s -> 1310.46s]  Time is almost up. I think that's I think that's right.
[1311.50s -> 1324.92s]  Comes the next question. Plagues of Egypt in the book of Exodus.
[1329.85s -> 1343.29s]  Lightning. Zap. Yikes. There's a ghost right behind you.
[1343.53s -> 1369.27s]  You're better than I thought. Closing in. Uh oh, here comes trouble.
[1372.38s -> 1382.66s]  It's only darkness. Can't you land locations? Everybody knows that.
[1383.30s -> 1387.54s]  No, I don't. Everybody knows that out there. No such thing as peanut acres.
[1388.74s -> 1392.98s]  Of course peanut acres is real. It's the only one I didn't pick. How do you know?
[1393.94s -> 1400.98s]  You stole some yummy life for us. There we go. The darkness approaches.
[1402.10s -> 1417.06s]  Beyonce albums. I don't know. Only boomers would know any of this shit. I got them both fucking
[1417.06s -> 1433.82s]  wrong. No, I didn't. Another life force swap. Come on, Star. Stage names. Bingo.
[1442.98s -> 1456.20s]  What? That's Val Kilmer. It's not Val Kilmer. Metric system units of measurement. Oh no,
[1456.20s -> 1476.42s]  Americans. We're Americans. Time is almost up. Am I muted? I shouldn't be muted. Am I muted?
[1476.58s -> 1483.93s]  No, I've been hearing you. Don't listen to her. Rise. Okay, now you're muted. What the
[1483.93s -> 1490.42s]  fuck is a sausage phone? A sauce-a-phone? Susophone. Oh, I thought it was sauce-a-phone.
[1490.42s -> 1497.14s]  Fuck, I'm gonna listen. You said sausage. Another life swap. Sauce-a-phone? I thought it was an A.
[1499.14s -> 1502.98s]  Where do you think you're going? You need a perfect answer for your final escape.
[1502.98s -> 1507.30s]  Oh, that's why I can't hear him. And that includes the third answer choice now too.
[1510.26s -> 1527.50s]  No, that wasn't Miss Melissa McCarthy. Yeah, somebody made it already. No, it's over.
[1532.47s -> 1546.84s]  Okay, apparently you just killed. All right. Awesome sauce wins. All right, that's it for that
[1546.84s -> 1551.88s]  one. That was all right. A little too draggy for me, in my opinion. I don't know about you guys.
[1553.00s -> 1558.71s]  I think I felt the same way about the last one too. I don't understand a single thing.
[1558.71s -> 1563.43s]  Wait, I think there should only be video game questions to cater to us, you know? Yeah.
[1563.43s -> 1567.91s]  Where's the questions like, you know, what character from The Legend of Zelda has
[1568.95s -> 1575.11s]  the biggest heart instead of which sea creature has three? You know, we don't. We all know that.
[1575.11s -> 1577.43s]  That's the question I liked, actually, because I got that one right.
[1578.71s -> 1582.79s]  Yeah, where's the video games only? All right, we're gonna do what's the one below it?
[1584.57s -> 1588.97s]  At least like big fucking nerd questions. We need a new code just to be clear that you'd be
[1588.97s -> 1594.78s]  showing on screen. Yep. Okay, and you should join before me so that I'm not the master.
[1594.78s -> 1599.26s]  That's what I'm gonna do. Role models. Everybody somebody. So who are you? The planner? The flake?
[1599.26s -> 1606.70s]  The sassy one? Step in the lab and find out. I'm getting, okay, hold on. I'm getting a huge
[1606.70s -> 1614.86s]  amount of people are saying this one sucks. Okay, I like the sound of joke boat.
[1614.86s -> 1620.38s]  This one is all this one is friends only. This won't work with chat. Oh, awesome sauce
[1620.38s -> 1625.18s]  because they won. Thanks for the 10 community subs. Fuck yeah. Yeah, when you win, you need
[1625.18s -> 1629.98s]  to give us money. It's not serious. Thanks a lot. I will do joke boat people saying joke boats like
[1629.98s -> 1634.14s]  the actual like the good one bro models, I guess is only with like people that are present.
[1636.10s -> 1650.31s]  Oh, we'll try. Yeah, make sure this is set correctly. Plays eight subtitles on
[1651.11s -> 1654.31s]  allow room code hiding. Thank you. Twitch integration.
[1657.05s -> 1661.38s]  Manual censoring. Yep. I don't want to have any fucking issues there.
[1662.10s -> 1676.20s]  Audience. Okay. All right. Twitch is required. Good to go. So I hold on. Let's see what happens.
[1677.16s -> 1684.87s]  I could do the same joke again. Welcome aboard. I'm Chuck Hull, your captain and
[1686.39s -> 1696.04s]  go ahead and sign in. We just joined first. And then I will just I'm just gonna. Oh, wait,
[1696.04s -> 1708.44s]  you guys can see this. Oh, yeah, don't go and don't come in yet. Anytime now. And hold on.
[1708.44s -> 1714.90s]  Why is it taking so long? What's wrong? Come on jackbox.tv servers. What's going on here?
[1716.01s -> 1724.42s]  All right, I am in. Oh, please. Whenever you're ready.
[1726.36s -> 1734.52s]  I beat you. How did you beat me? I beat you by a lot. Wait, why did you beat me? Okay, I got
[1734.52s -> 1745.67s]  day discord. Wait, wait, make sure of actually gets in. Okay. Okay. Discord. Quick before the
[1745.67s -> 1763.29s]  ship leaves the dock. You ready? Here it comes. Fuck, I forget it. Hold on. It was literally four
[1763.29s -> 1773.24s]  characters. Let's move it, people. Yeah, our character portraits are mixed up. What are you
[1773.24s -> 1779.24s]  talking about? I look like you. You look like. I don't know. Ashley has pigtails for sure.
[1781.27s -> 1790.10s]  One more person. Come on. And then I'm I look like Ashley Lang. All right. Oh, please. Here we go.
[1790.10s -> 1795.72s]  You're ready. Everybody's in. Everybody is in. There's the code on the screen. Join the audience.
[1795.72s -> 1806.38s]  This is the joke factory. Whatever. I don't even know what it's called. I get it. Get it.
[1811.93s -> 1817.37s]  Here's tonight's itinerary. We're going to write some jokes and then test them out on stage. But
[1817.37s -> 1823.77s]  first things first, it's brainstorming time. Before we jump into the jokes, let's do a little
[1823.77s -> 1829.37s]  writing exercise to get inspired on your device. You'll be prompted to write various topics like
[1829.37s -> 1834.33s]  animals, people or objects. Fill in whatever you think has a lot of comedic potential.
[1834.33s -> 1840.41s]  If another player uses one of your topics in a short, you'll get a bonus. Bobby, generate as
[1840.41s -> 1884.06s]  many as you can. You have 45 seconds starting now. Great joke topic. This writing exercise is
[1884.06s -> 1895.40s]  ending soon. Follow the steps on your device to write two jokes. I did so bad. Trust your
[1895.40s -> 1901.53s]  instincts. Okay. Yeah. None of mine were funny. No. Okay. Hold on. Complete the jokes on your device.
[1907.32s -> 1920.94s]  Okay. Um, this is, how, how can I make a punchline from this? I can't think with you talking.
[1922.57s -> 1925.29s]  If I'm ever going to be a comedy writer, I have to fucking nail this.
[1934.55s -> 1948.94s]  There's a joke for me button. Please make it funny for me. I, but this is the, this is,
[1949.18s -> 1955.70s]  uh, God damn it. I have to do this. I have to do this.
[1957.08s -> 1960.04s]  We're going to find out if you're a real comedian or not right now. You'll find out.
[1962.14s -> 1965.82s]  This is your legacy. Yeah. No, no. Fuck. I shouldn't have done that.
[1967.34s -> 1969.74s]  I want to redo on mine. I didn't realize I had another minute.
[1971.93s -> 1980.76s]  Now we're talking to comedy. Oh my God. Damn it. I want to redo. I'm done with my jokes. You guys
[1980.76s -> 1985.48s]  done? Yeah. That's why, like I, I don't have a timer in my window, but if I realized it was
[1985.48s -> 1992.04s]  like 50 more seconds, I would have thought. Oh, we have 50 more seconds. Shit. Yeah. I thought
[1992.04s -> 2007.93s]  it was a race. I want to, can I go back? Joke boat. Captain, let me in. Oh, the time pressure was
[2007.93s -> 2012.17s]  like happy music in the chat, like scrolling so fast. Yeah. And Jeremiah talking about his,
[2012.73s -> 2016.49s]  his life story. Mute me, mute me, mute me. I thought I had like 10 seconds.
[2018.25s -> 2023.85s]  I did not write poop for the record. Here we go. You ever notice how cruise line captains drive
[2023.85s -> 2030.89s]  like this, but barge captains drive like this? No. Okay. Here's our first comment. I apologize
[2030.89s -> 2039.75s]  for my joke already, even though, you know, it's exactly, here we go. Remember to say your catch
[2039.75s -> 2054.50s]  phrase. A group of spoons walk into a bar and pee pee poo poo. No way. No bubble wrap.
[2056.15s -> 2065.19s]  You got to read it. What does perform the joke mean? I guess you've just, I don't know. Just do it.
[2066.57s -> 2073.37s]  Oh, the buttons went away. I'm so dumb. I thought rap songs were good. Okay.
[2073.93s -> 2079.27s]  What? They call me DNA. What the fuck does that mean? That was pretty cool.
[2081.27s -> 2094.94s]  Better joke. Look now. Well, I really don't want to compete with pee pee poo poo. It's impossible.
[2094.94s -> 2099.42s]  You can't compete with pee pee poo poo. You know, you're talking about Twitch chat.
[2101.02s -> 2107.34s]  You lost. Whoa. It like rap. That's what it is. You hit them right in the field. They're like,
[2107.90s -> 2113.98s]  to you. Wait, you got a bonus? Get that lights mattering of a pause going.
[2118.20s -> 2121.96s]  I call my bedrooms a hell because I'm Satan.
[2138.65s -> 2144.26s]  My love life is like Napoleon. They always run away. Not your dad's compact car. What?
[2145.22s -> 2150.42s]  This is catchphrase. Vote for your favorite joke now. I wish this was like the horror man.
[2150.42s -> 2157.30s]  So we get to vote which person dies. No, we're being thrown overboard in the end. I'm sure.
[2172.74s -> 2180.02s]  Seven, 70. Our next comic needs an introduction. It's me versus you. My jokes aren't jokes.
[2180.50s -> 2188.33s]  I'm a nasty little dry erase board because I'm soaking wet.
[2192.58s -> 2207.08s]  Who ordered the flight attendant? I thought it was going to be me. Don't worry. They're all
[2207.08s -> 2211.16s]  going to vote for you anyway. I'm going to open up a store that only sells walruses and call it
[2211.16s -> 2224.36s]  Walrus Mart. Don't get your strong. Can you explain the joke? How do you not get mine? It's
[2224.36s -> 2233.32s]  the perfect setup. It's like a perfect setup. But you're a dry erase board. Don't you get it?
[2234.70s -> 2243.54s]  No. I don't have to spell it out for you? Yeah. The one on the right just added
[2243.54s -> 2250.06s]  March to the word Walrus. Yeah, but at least it's made sense. And a tip of the hat to you.
[2250.06s -> 2261.61s]  What the fuck? Here's another comedian whether you like it or not. I like my friends like I like
[2261.61s -> 2267.62s]  my cars. Oh, it's a bitch. This one's going to damage your windows. It's just compacting it.
[2270.84s -> 2280.95s]  This whole bit is compact cars. Every joke, the punchline is compact cars. Why are they called
[2280.95s -> 2294.50s]  flat earthers and not should be called flat scurfers? Is that your seat? No, I haven't like
[2294.50s -> 2299.22s]  bro, bro, bro, bro, bro, bro has gone twice. I haven't gotten up on the stage once. I'm scared.
[2300.34s -> 2308.63s]  I'm going to vote for the compact car comic is better. Sorry, German. I just like the theming.
[2312.58s -> 2317.67s]  What was it? Is it his theme? It's not really original. I mean, he's winning.
[2319.16s -> 2323.64s]  And how about some points for you? Would you guys know the jackbox meta? Whoever's live stream
[2323.64s -> 2329.72s]  is currently live streaming our next comedian. Just go after. Am I, am I allowed to tell my
[2329.72s -> 2335.32s]  jokes? Tell them. What are you talking about? They're not other like they just keep calling
[2335.32s -> 2339.40s]  people up and I'm like, you're doing so bad and you're so comfortable. Okay. We didn't have
[2339.40s -> 2352.62s]  hashtags at tic tac toe. That is very boomer joke. There you go. Here's yours. Oh God. Oh God.
[2353.66s -> 2361.78s]  I'm not ready. I'm scared. Go after all that. I'm voting for you, baby. You ever notice how Mr.
[2361.94s -> 2369.91s]  Peanut looks like a peanut in a suit? If you win and I, if I lose,
[2377.98s -> 2383.10s]  it's a comedy error. People think that's funny. People, people are saying that that was a funny
[2383.10s -> 2392.62s]  joke, but my joke that had like setup and new ones. I'm just also, he's not in a suit. That's
[2392.62s -> 2398.62s]  right. I'm so brilliant compared to German. Thank you. Thank you. My adoring crowd.
[2401.98s -> 2406.38s]  Folks put your hand and hook together for our next comedian. Oh, they want me back.
[2406.38s -> 2415.10s]  Encore. They say encore. Give me a break. Have you heard about the big bad wolf challenge?
[2416.38s -> 2421.59s]  It's where you exercise till you puff and puff. That's, that's as bad as mine was.
[2422.15s -> 2428.47s]  That's actually the auto-generate joke. You, what? You hit the auto-generate button.
[2428.47s -> 2433.51s]  I thought I had 10 seconds. Oh my God. I honestly thought if I didn't type it in the next three
[2433.51s -> 2440.39s]  seconds, it was going to do nothing. They turned on you. They turned on you real quick. Okay.
[2453.35s -> 2458.07s]  Yours was auto-generated. So I have to pick the other one. I still pick the AI over a joke
[2458.07s -> 2465.94s]  that bad. That's like when like robots are going to take over the world and you're letting them.
[2465.94s -> 2473.06s]  Wait, no, you wait. Yes. Which one is better for me? It even tells you joke for me.
[2474.58s -> 2483.08s]  Joe, please joke for me. What a fraud. It was the time. I don't even, I don't remember
[2483.08s -> 2487.24s]  what my other one was. Let's keep things going for the next comedy. Okay. We're playing this game again.
[2488.12s -> 2492.84s]  Yeah. Now that we all understand, I'm not going to let this smug ass parrot.
[2493.96s -> 2500.62s]  My family is like Bigfoot. Don't photograph well. Is that auto-generated?
[2503.56s -> 2509.42s]  Yeah. That seems, that seems like a joke for me. All right. German is going to take them down.
[2509.42s -> 2513.42s]  Here we go. The big reveal. Let's go. If people think this, whatever.
[2514.30s -> 2519.02s]  Hello. My doctor said I have a bad case of the soap operas
[2520.66s -> 2522.82s]  because I'm the cleanest I've ever been.
[2536.49s -> 2543.67s]  It wasn't an auto joke. Well, that's, I guess I have to pick it. No, it tells you after the vote.
[2543.67s -> 2549.67s]  I think if it was. What? Yeah. It's stamped it after. That was a joke for me. Yeah. You guys
[2549.67s -> 2555.75s]  voted for the auto joke. Your doctor says you have a bad case of being clean.
[2556.71s -> 2561.91s]  A bad case of being cleaned. That's the point. I can't make some noise for our next comment.
[2563.19s -> 2573.93s]  I don't choose the prompt. You did get to choose the prompt in a way. What's the difference between
[2573.93s -> 2583.70s]  most people and people and people has an end. Oh my God. It made no sense. I didn't pick the most
[2583.70s -> 2596.42s]  people and people. Oh, she didn't get to pick the prompt. I didn't. It's very literal. He wrote
[2596.42s -> 2602.86s]  the word boomer. He wins. Man. First I compete against pee pee poo poo and now I compete against
[2602.86s -> 2608.54s]  boomer. So old I remember when Elbertson was a boomer. Click it. Everybody click it.
[2609.34s -> 2618.41s]  What? I forgive you though, Ashley, because you had my top joke of the entire thing which was
[2618.41s -> 2627.85s]  I remember people. Thank you. I'm here for you. Oh my God. You won anyway. Nice assist. Assist.
[2630.55s -> 2635.82s]  Thank you, Chad. This is a horrible cut up. Let's see.
[2638.06s -> 2640.38s]  Yeah, just wait for it to end too. Oh, I'm beating German.
[2644.38s -> 2645.18s]  Wake up screaming.
[2645.66s -> 2654.87s]  Both of you. How about that?
[2664.14s -> 2668.94s]  Well, we're sinking again. There's no time to write jokes from scratch. So here's the plan.
[2668.94s -> 2673.66s]  Let's rewrite another comics joke. You'll use the same setup, but we'll attempt to write
[2673.66s -> 2679.10s]  a funnier punchline. The better the original joke did, the more points you'll earn for beating it.
[2679.10s -> 2684.22s]  Can you steal the spotlight before the boat sinks? Let's find out. I think I understand.
[2685.18s -> 2718.09s]  Okay. Wait. That was me. Mine was me responding to it. I'm sorry. I fucked it up. That was me
[2718.09s -> 2726.92s]  respond. Whatever. I can't believe I wasted my joke on this. Me too. I was like responding. Fuck.
[2726.92s -> 2736.78s]  Whatever. Okay. I need to be clear. When my joke comes up, it's not me telling the joke. It's
[2736.78s -> 2749.35s]  Dennis. It's a character thing. That still doesn't help. Hello. Is that your way to pass
[2749.35s -> 2756.81s]  off like an offensive joke or something? No. It's not me doing it. It's not me writing this.
[2758.17s -> 2775.82s]  It's my character saying this. I'm just waiting for the full redo. Well, full redo. We're going
[2775.82s -> 2794.63s]  to the next game after this. Here's the number one. What's the difference between most people
[2794.63s -> 2808.09s]  and people? Nothing is the same word, dummy. Oh no, he got scooped. Which version do you like
[2808.09s -> 2813.94s]  best? Obviously, and this is not fair to the original comedian because they have time to
[2813.94s -> 2823.93s]  figure out what they want to say. Those seems lopsided. You can replace it. Also, like in the
[2823.93s -> 2830.65s]  world of comedy, I just feel like bro Baruto just ripped off Ashley and he loses a lot of points
[2830.65s -> 2835.05s]  for even trying to reiterate on the joke. Oh, I still won. Yeah, through that guy. He just stole
[2835.05s -> 2841.37s]  your joke. Well, we're all stealing jokes here. Yeah, that's just not cool. Remember when that
[2841.37s -> 2848.74s]  one comedian did that? My love life is like Napoleon. Significantly shorter than I would have
[2848.74s -> 2878.15s]  wanted. A real clash of the titans. That's pretty good. Sorry. Sorry. I picked really bad nouns in
[2878.15s -> 2882.95s]  the beginning. One of the questions was two spoons walk into a bar. I got to take responsibility
[2882.95s -> 2912.49s]  for writing the word spoon. I don't know. No, no, no, no, no. I'm going for Satan. That's way
[2912.49s -> 2922.10s]  better. That little face. It's not me writing this. It's somebody else. They're both good.
[2922.10s -> 2926.90s]  I've been watching it all the time and remembering how Dennis definitely is a serial killer. Yeah,
[2926.90s -> 2940.63s]  you have to read it in his voice. No, well, don't worry. Okay. Let's all make fun of German
[2940.63s -> 2946.31s]  now. You're going to laugh at my joke. Why are they called flat earthers and not go read any book?
[2948.55s -> 2961.66s]  What do you think? That's the best one yet. I was merely responding. Maybe phase two of the
[2961.66s -> 2980.30s]  boat isn't that bad. You have some comedy. Any book. That's not a joke. That's just a harsh truth.
[2980.94s -> 2988.06s]  All right. Gurpers though. Come on.
[2991.82s -> 2993.50s]  Notice how Mr. Peanut looks like
[2996.02s -> 3007.02s]  fancier German. No. What? Well, you said the name of the streamer. So I don't know. It's going to be
[3007.02s -> 3029.30s]  tight. I wrote peanut. Oh my God. 4555. Oh, you beat the reference.
[3039.78s -> 3047.14s]  All right. My doctor said I have a bad case of the soap operas because he doesn't have a real
[3047.22s -> 3053.66s]  me. You know what I mean? No, I didn't write, you know what I mean?
[3057.58s -> 3062.52s]  I do that all the time though. You know what I mean? You guys know what I mean?
[3062.52s -> 3069.24s]  I do that all the fucking time. What the fuck just happened? It added you know what I mean on
[3069.24s -> 3072.58s]  the end because I didn't I'm still trying to
[3076.39s -> 3081.85s]  people voted for it and that's that's even worse. Whoever you are, you're a hero to me.
[3084.23s -> 3090.15s]  And you know what? I got you more points. Thank you. I appreciate that. Just throwing throwing
[3091.19s -> 3097.43s]  I'm gonna ask you a little dry erase board because dear God, this joke is so bad. I can't even save
[3097.43s -> 3109.14s]  it. What's not to understand? Explain it. I can't. I'm not going to explain this. I'm a nasty dry
[3109.14s -> 3117.94s]  erase board because right, but you can't be a dry erase board if that's why that's the joke because
[3117.94s -> 3127.61s]  it's it's it's sexual. I didn't pick. How am I going to explain this? I mean, I get where you're
[3127.61s -> 3136.84s]  going, but it doesn't make any sense. It's like it doesn't work. Oh, he beat you. I wasn't expecting
[3136.84s -> 3154.34s]  that. I like my friends. I like my cars. Rumors only. It's gonna be tough. We've got two stream
[3154.34s -> 3171.70s]  references. Compact guy is the original car jokesman. It's pretty split. No, that was pretty close.
[3172.10s -> 3186.90s]  Which comedian is leaving with me in the lifeboat? Let's find out who deserves it the most. That's
[3186.90s -> 3200.81s]  kind of scary. Wow. Okay, we actually if we voted against compact car guy, then German would have
[3200.81s -> 3215.99s]  won. Yeah. Well, that was fun. All right. Let's go to the next one. We can do it again. We'll do
[3216.07s -> 3219.35s]  we'll do this one again like after we go. We need the redo new players.
[3220.47s -> 3227.18s]  Hold on. Wait. Whoa. Whoa. I'm in control. Oh, yeah, you are in control. Oh, well, I just get
[3227.18s -> 3232.06s]  I click the board and I'm Chuck Hall. I'll be your host tonight. Tell me what you're doing.
[3232.06s -> 3238.65s]  I'll behave. All right. Don't do it yet. Let me don't like don't even press the button.
[3246.52s -> 3254.68s]  Toot toot. We got a scoot. Everyone, you know, think of some funny nouns like boomers and, you
[3254.68s -> 3260.54s]  know, excellent, which means a toot. Yeah, that's that's good. All right. Join a poopy
[3260.54s -> 3269.83s]  pee pee poo poo. Join it. And then when you're in, put it in the discord. We don't have all day.
[3270.87s -> 3280.44s]  Ashley's in. And so is star. Okay. Now, let's put this in the discord.
[3282.18s -> 3290.66s]  Ashley changed. We all change bodies. This is how it was supposed to be. Just like in try. We don't
[3290.66s -> 3311.19s]  have all day. Bagel boy. My more. Oh, oh, okay. I just realized. Okay. Derma put. Derma put what?
[3311.99s -> 3319.16s]  Anytime now. Come on in, everybody. Derma puts what? Well, you need to click. Everyone's ready.
[3320.14s -> 3323.42s]  I know you got max players. Just making sure because you haven't done it yet.
[3323.90s -> 3330.38s]  I got you. You better not talk to me once. I gotta get everyone. This is writer's room.
[3330.38s -> 3337.18s]  Silence. Quiet chat. Derma put sun chips in F tier. Let me ask both of your questions really quickly.
[3338.38s -> 3346.54s]  Are sun chips good? Would you pick sun chips? Comedians. Here's tonight's itinerary. Yada yada.
[3346.54s -> 3350.22s]  Moving on. Okay. There we go. Star.
[3350.22s -> 3387.96s]  Star. Really? Okay. I guess it makes sense. Just like my premium cable bundle, this writing
[3387.96s -> 3398.55s]  exercise is ending soon. All right. Now it's time to write some comedy. Follow the steps to construct
[3398.55s -> 3410.84s]  two jokes. Oh, I forgot to do minus two. Nobody did anything. You talked about sun chips. Oh,
[3410.84s -> 3420.76s]  I said the word sun chip. Yeah. I ain't picking that one. Oh God. I should not have picked this.
[3420.76s -> 3427.08s]  The only jokes I can think of are very bad. Don't stop it. Very bad. Don't get out. I will. I will
[3427.08s -> 3432.04s]  censor your joke. I'm not doing it, but I just like, I, I am in a situation now where there's,
[3432.04s -> 3436.92s]  this is very difficult to not make this. Don't do it. Awful. Don't do it. Do something. Skip.
[3436.92s -> 3458.36s]  Do something else. Oh God. I'm sorry. You, I fucking around. I will actually boot you from
[3458.36s -> 3465.74s]  this call and I will boot you from this. I will censor you. I'll do it. Don't make me do it.
[3466.90s -> 3472.49s]  I'm going to do a joke. Okay. You should be starting on your second joke soon. If you
[3472.49s -> 3488.89s]  haven't already. I, what am I going to write for this fucking thing? Oh yeah. This is also awful.
[3491.21s -> 3499.85s]  This isn't like bad. Awful. This is, uh, just, I, I, uh, whatever. I don't care.
[3500.57s -> 3523.75s]  Uh, these are, these two are such bad prompts. Um, time's running out. Submit what you can.
[3530.92s -> 3536.47s]  I don't know. Whatever. I don't, whatever. I don't care. Mine are terrible. Looks like some
[3536.47s -> 3541.43s]  of you didn't finish your jokes too bad. God, this is going to be worse than the first one. I
[3541.43s -> 3547.75s]  can just feel it. I am ready. I'm ready to fucking get ready. Wow. Talk about close
[3547.83s -> 3551.51s]  quarters. Why are all the setups the same again? Dang it, Chuck. You screwed it up again. I got
[3551.51s -> 3564.07s]  like the exact same one. Here's our first comic. How many boomers does it take to change a light
[3564.07s -> 3572.34s]  bulb? Three. One to screw it in and two to complain about millennials. Is that auto generated?
[3573.22s -> 3576.90s]  That, that is, it's definitely not, but that's so bad. It's an auto complete.
[3577.86s -> 3580.60s]  That's a spicy controversy.
[3582.60s -> 3588.26s]  What's the difference between most people and sheep? Most people have their own opinions.
[3596.50s -> 3607.11s]  Okay, judges, render your verdict. He told it backwards. Well, you don't, you don't get to
[3607.11s -> 3624.60s]  choose the first half of your joke. I don't even have a choice. I do believe you're owed some points.
[3624.60s -> 3629.88s]  Why? Because why boomers? I don't understand. A round of applause for our next comedian.
[3630.84s -> 3635.48s]  Hi, Jeremy. You're muted. Why do you keep doing that? Wait, what? Cause the letter L.
[3636.20s -> 3639.00s]  I'm so old. I remember when Doopey. Doopey?
[3645.02s -> 3649.66s]  It asked me to type in a player's name, a person's name and I got confused and I wrote Doopey for a
[3649.66s -> 3654.78s]  person and then he picked that one. Doopey. Oh, that's your fault. Yeah, that's my fault.
[3655.42s -> 3661.94s]  I love this. Yeah, these are the worst things I've ever thought of.
[3663.94s -> 3674.10s]  Marriage is a lot like, you know what I mean? I mean, that's funny in its own way, but I don't
[3674.10s -> 3684.55s]  want to, I don't want to, you know what I mean? God damn it.
[3684.55s -> 3700.25s]  It's so funny. You know that there's something wrong when, you know, this is like random chat
[3700.25s -> 3705.37s]  members here that could write crazy shit and I'm concerned about the guy in the call writing the
[3705.37s -> 3712.22s]  crazy shit. You're going to read my joke. I was going to write gross. You got to write shit.
[3717.18s -> 3722.28s]  Oh, I'm fine. I don't know where he got it.
[3725.11s -> 3739.96s]  I thought mice were a bowl of feeling love. That's just not true. That's just not true.
[3741.40s -> 3761.96s]  Is this like a furry thing? Trucks. Imagine fighting the truck punch line.
[3764.78s -> 3772.12s]  Yeah, you got, you got to go to jackbox.tv and then put in the code. H J I I.
[3772.44s -> 3776.04s]  All right. Let's hear it for the next performer.
[3776.04s -> 3778.60s]  I hope I'm up against you. I'm going to take you down.
[3778.60s -> 3781.08s]  It's, it's guaranteed to win. I'm guaranteed to win because you just got,
[3781.08s -> 3785.56s]  I'm going to just censor yours. So it's okay. Oh yeah. Don't forget to say your catchphrase.
[3786.60s -> 3790.76s]  This is bad. I didn't have any time. Why did the weighted blanket cross the road?
[3792.42s -> 3798.02s]  It didn't. It's a weighted blanket. Oh my God. I had, I was too busy. Look,
[3798.10s -> 3804.42s]  oh my God, I was too busy yelling at you to not be offensive on stream.
[3805.22s -> 3813.14s]  I wasn't. We were typing. My joke was very appropriate. Um, in good taste.
[3814.58s -> 3819.78s]  I have more convertibles than a person who thinks rain is a myth.
[3822.14s -> 3825.26s]  That's not very many people though. You don't have, you have like none. How many do you have?
[3825.26s -> 3832.86s]  Zero. Imagine when Jerma wins this one. Yeah, nice. They give him the softball.
[3836.22s -> 3839.82s]  Oh, it's comedy battle night. Let's bring Jerma nine eight five up and his opponent,
[3840.54s -> 3848.86s]  a beach ball. And that was, I still win. Oh, he was a joke for me. I still win.
[3855.86s -> 3866.57s]  Okay. Up next. Eagle boy. You had one zero so far. Let's see what you got now.
[3866.57s -> 3876.44s]  My love life is like the Hulk. I feel nothing but frustration. Give me body wash.
[3882.95s -> 3885.83s]  I don't know why it asked if you're ready. These are both very literal and
[3886.87s -> 3890.31s]  just go. Just don't. It's just, you can explain the joke. It don't have to.
[3890.87s -> 3894.39s]  My nickname is plunger because I love my work as a plumber. It's just
[3894.95s -> 3905.66s]  I sent you up with a funny toilet object and you give me that.
[3906.54s -> 3911.18s]  I was not at my attention. I don't have my full attention on the game. Did you? I wrote plunger.
[3912.22s -> 3915.34s]  I wrote plunger. Did we both write plunger? I think we both.
[3918.94s -> 3923.58s]  Wow. All of the nouns in the world and we both picked plunger. Holy shit.
[3923.58s -> 3930.94s]  Yes. Yeah. No. All right. So let me just, let me, I gotta defend myself.
[3932.38s -> 3937.42s]  During this, you were going during this whole time, you were going, Oh, I can't write this.
[3937.42s -> 3943.26s]  Oh, no, no, I'm going, I'm in trouble. Have you tried trucking? Have you ever tried trucking?
[3943.26s -> 3947.02s]  That's when you have given up. I gave up on the joke.
[3951.50s -> 3955.90s]  I got a stream to run and you're sitting there going, Whoa, this is going to get TOS.
[3957.64s -> 3963.08s]  I want to open a store that only sells Cheetos and call it cheesy German bloomers are us. Well,
[3963.08s -> 3973.82s]  fuck, I'm censoring you. Do you have a sensor button? Oh, he does. Oh my God.
[3973.82s -> 3977.90s]  Don't censor me. Oh my God. Ashley just keeps giving up.
[3981.42s -> 3989.02s]  Heck yeah. You better not censor mine. I'm going to censor it. This better not be bad.
[3990.47s -> 3993.75s]  I'm going to be actually IRL upset. It's fine.
[3998.57s -> 4001.45s]  That's where you be a white and don't bring one to school.
[4002.33s -> 4013.24s]  Fuck. Get out of here. You're out. You're out. You're out. You're out. All right. Let's hear it
[4013.24s -> 4024.15s]  for our next comedian. Me again. What? You both failed. My grandma said the best thing about
[4024.15s -> 4038.87s]  reality shows is that Bob Barker is freaking cute. No. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no,
[4038.87s -> 4043.67s]  not another one. I want that. Wait, wait, this better be like, this better be like a knock,
[4043.99s -> 4048.81s]  Joe. If this ain't like I'm an Asti little Rubik's Cube.
[4063.24s -> 4066.28s]  You just got to censor everyone until you win and feel good about yourself.
[4066.92s -> 4072.28s]  Who is currently winning comedy? Let's see. Oh, who's winning comedy? I wonder. Oh,
[4072.28s -> 4077.24s]  third place. Look at me. This whole thing's rigged.
[4081.67s -> 4089.90s]  All right. Here's where we're really bad. I got my finger on the button.
[4091.26s -> 4099.18s]  PG 13 and no offensive bullshit. Well, we're sinking again. There's no time. Okay. Yeah,
[4099.18s -> 4113.93s]  you keep swearing. You know the drill. Oh, no. These both of these setups are awful. I know.
[4114.81s -> 4145.75s]  Uh, I love this one. That's terrible. Fuck. I can't admit it.
[4162.86s -> 4168.22s]  Germa is allowed to sexualize dry erase boards, but Kurt Starr can't make a sexy Rubik's Cube
[4168.22s -> 4178.02s]  joke. Exactly. Someone gets it. Get out of here. Germa was the original R rated Joe after your
[4178.02s -> 4186.90s]  first fucking material there. I had the, I, excuse me. Oh, we just pretending like the first one
[4186.90s -> 4191.48s]  didn't exist. And German, you can't, I don't even hear you. You're muted again because you
[4191.48s -> 4197.96s]  typed an L. Well, you just turn on the stream. Women and children go in the lifeboats first.
[4197.96s -> 4200.68s]  Everyone else stick around and welcome back our performers.
[4201.80s -> 4205.99s]  What about the Bob? That was just accidental. I've deleted like 30 videos accidentally. I'm
[4205.99s -> 4211.93s]  accidentally going to mute someone. Marriage is a lot like germs. It makes you sick.
[4212.97s -> 4220.81s]  That's pretty good. That's a pretty good PG PG like 1950s comedy. Did they successfully beat this
[4220.81s -> 4236.39s]  joke? You know what I mean? Marriage. It's the same joke, but just told differently. Yeah. That's
[4236.39s -> 4251.50s]  the beauty of comedy. Oh yeah. You didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. All right,
[4251.50s -> 4260.54s]  bagel boy. What do you got? I'm a nasty little tornado because I spin out of control. Like this
[4260.54s -> 4275.94s]  game of joke boat has which punch line is better because I, Oh, he's up against that one.
[4277.70s -> 4284.17s]  Because that's, that's, that could be stars joke. Number one that I censored could be one of the
[4284.17s -> 4291.93s]  three I censored. No, no, he's like up against the AI. Yeah. Cause I deleted three jokes. Oh,
[4292.57s -> 4298.57s]  Oh, so they don't even get to go up against mine again because I was censored that much.
[4299.29s -> 4304.41s]  You got a double censored. Okay. So I just don't even exist anymore.
[4306.57s -> 4323.83s]  You are like face down into water. He asked nicely. What? Kill him. That's way better than mine.
[4324.39s -> 4335.05s]  Okay. Star, you're going to be really bad in about probably one to two minutes. I think
[4335.93s -> 4339.29s]  why? Cause you're going to censor me again? No, cause there's nothing for you to censor.
[4339.29s -> 4343.13s]  There's nothing for me to censor, but you're going to be very upset about this in particular.
[4343.13s -> 4349.19s]  I'm just kind of seeing it already. Oh, you lost. Yeah. You're going to, you're about to be very
[4349.19s -> 4357.93s]  angry. Did you just like take my joke and rewrite it? No. My love life is like the Hulk starts out
[4358.01s -> 4361.69s]  small, but then it gets big and green. I should see a doctor.
[4365.54s -> 4368.26s]  How come you get to keep writing sexual jokes? Yeah.
[4377.56s -> 4387.00s]  Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead. You can't, you can't. I, I have all the power. I have all the power. Yeah.
[4392.04s -> 4396.92s]  He's a hypocrite. He's a hypocrite. Hypocrite. He's a fucking hypocrite.
[4396.92s -> 4405.91s]  Shut up. Silence. I just stood up for my fucking throne. You don't make me stand up from the
[4405.91s -> 4411.75s]  throne. You better try trucking. That's when you and your truck friends all go to the bar. I like
[4411.75s -> 4428.04s]  that one. You? Well, it's better than mine. So quarantine. Jerry was going crazy from the power.
[4428.52s -> 4440.63s]  I thought somebody went for me.
[4442.87s -> 4450.95s]  He's rubbing his hands together. You heard about the jack box challenge.
[4453.32s -> 4456.04s]  That's where you censor everyone's answers until you win.
[4458.36s -> 4463.03s]  It's funny because it's true. Oh, I mean you asked for it.
[4467.78s -> 4471.14s]  What? How? You're not supposed to be able to participate. What happened? What, what, what
[4471.14s -> 4478.10s]  madness is this? What? My power. I'm so dumb. I thought mice were. What happened to my power?
[4478.10s -> 4496.58s]  Laugh. I'm censored. Oh, no. He's just waiting till the last second. There was nothing to censor.
[4496.58s -> 4502.55s]  I mean, you just said it. I didn't see how to do it. Funny callback though.
[4503.51s -> 4515.62s]  Come on. Thank you. Thank you.
[4516.66s -> 4525.70s]  Jerma is fucking shaking. Resisting the urge to censor. No, I got the way to blanket across the
[4525.70s -> 4534.74s]  road any longer. You know what I mean? That's the best joke of the whole night.
[4536.90s -> 4538.10s]  That's the best one of the whole night.
[4540.90s -> 4545.38s]  But you know what I mean? Really? The end, the end really ties it all together. I think
[4546.02s -> 4564.07s]  seriously. Perfect. Those. Hey, thanks. The 60 people that voted for me. You're loyal.
[4564.71s -> 4570.15s]  I recognize that guy's name. 3% of you. You're loyal. I check you on the ballot. I knew it.
[4570.15s -> 4575.03s]  That is my King's God saving when the ship capsizes. Let's find out.
[4575.67s -> 4588.62s]  Oh, dude. The best. Good job, man. I wish I would have gotten to participate.
[4590.94s -> 4599.34s]  Because I wasn't censored. Yeah. Yeah, you're stupid. You flew too close to the sun.
[4600.14s -> 4606.31s]  You see how I got 97% of that vote? I did, but like, come on. All right, let's do another one.
[4606.31s -> 4618.36s]  Oh, freester. Let's do the one. No word. Censor it, dude.
[4623.10s -> 4632.25s]  Is this how the king dies? No, it can't be. I'm choking on my own water. All right,
[4632.25s -> 4637.53s]  what should we do? Push the button. Vocabulary game. Dictionarium. Humans have been inventing
[4637.53s -> 4642.57s]  words and phrases for centuries. Now it's your turn to contribute an entry to the pages of the
[4642.57s -> 4656.52s]  Dictionarium. This seems fun. Let's try it. Push the button is the best one. Okay,
[4656.52s -> 4661.53s]  we'll do it after this. What time is it for? Yeah, we've got like another hour or so.
[4662.17s -> 4685.86s]  Like an hour and a half. Okay, archive. Am I allowed to play this one? Yeah, if you behave.
[4686.98s -> 4690.78s]  All right, you just gotta promise me to not say anything sexual and I won't either
[4692.06s -> 4695.18s]  because you're the only one that can get me going like that. You know what I'm saying?
[4698.50s -> 4706.14s]  All right, that's enough. That's enough. King is spoken. You know, I don't want to be the king.
[4706.14s -> 4714.98s]  The king always just dies. Like it sucks to be the king. The king always loses always every time.
[4714.98s -> 4720.97s]  Want to be the jack? I kind of just I want to be like the guy that makes the bread. That
[4720.97s -> 4731.37s]  guy's life is always fine. Yeah, people always need bread. All right, so I have to get rid of
[4731.37s -> 4744.58s]  this and don't go in yet. I know that you two are going to be raring to go, but hold on. Go ahead.
[4744.58s -> 4761.51s]  Only win. Yeah, get in there. All right, discord. It's your turn. Come on in. Three, two, one. Here
[4761.51s -> 4773.75s]  it comes. And now it shows up. Cool. Hey, everybody else. Go on if you want to.
[4782.74s -> 4785.22s]  All right, we got it. All right, we got it. We got it. How do you boot?
[4786.18s -> 4796.36s]  Can you? How do you keep? Can you? He got in fair and square. Do not censor him. Don't.
[4797.32s -> 4800.54s]  There are thousands of people who want to play. All right, now you're going to make me look like
[4800.54s -> 4809.14s]  the bad guy because let's go. Let's go. I'm not. I'm the bad guy. Bad guy. Bad baker.
[4812.18s -> 4815.14s]  Word game or slang phrase game?
[4819.14s -> 4825.94s]  What an intelligent crew in the dictionary. You will create a dictionary entry for a made up word
[4826.02s -> 4830.26s]  and you will win if your answers get the most votes. Oh, that's fun. Oh, P.S.
[4830.26s -> 4834.90s]  Feel free to join the audience. Enter the room code to play along. Let's rock.
[4838.04s -> 4840.36s]  First things first. I am assigning you a word.
[4843.80s -> 4848.84s]  What do you think this word means? Write it down on your definition for the new word on your device.
[4852.58s -> 4856.98s]  Fun fact. This word is banned for most aquariums. So we have to do definition for that word. All
[4856.98s -> 4869.21s]  right. Let's see. We can't. As long as you're using letters, you really can't.
[4869.21s -> 4877.43s]  Letters are disappearing. It's a timer. It's like a minute. I can't think of anything.
[4878.23s -> 4881.59s]  I know it's hard. It really is hard to come up with like something like that.
[4881.59s -> 4897.32s]  Somebody throws at you. It would help if I know how to spell this word.
[4904.60s -> 4910.12s]  I mean, you got to submit very, very soon. Like right now. I don't know.
[4913.24s -> 4917.08s]  I think everybody's reaction is always, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
[4917.08s -> 4923.13s]  That's what the word means. I don't know. Show me the definitions.
[4939.75s -> 4946.55s]  Okay. The time has come to vote. Pick your favorite definition and quietly admire the rest.
[4947.51s -> 4955.35s]  All these answers are terrible. And remember, you can award bonus points to the ones that
[4955.35s -> 4966.14s]  stole your heart. Are any of these like supposed to be correct? No, you can't be correct.
[4969.62s -> 4976.58s]  It's not a real word. It's whichever one speaks to you. Come on, vote. What? It takes so long to
[4976.58s -> 4978.82s]  decide. Oh yeah, but then we all have to vote.
[4986.57s -> 4989.85s]  By the way, the official note take backs definition for the word is
[4991.21s -> 4993.48s]  when you eat too many trains.
[4999.64s -> 5002.25s]  You go to bite your food and end up falling down the
[5002.25s -> 5008.49s]  train. To slowly stroke a chimp's hair, a loser chimp,
[5011.37s -> 5018.09s]  but with an E, you know what I'm saying? No, we can't. No more. You know what I'm saying.
[5018.25s -> 5020.41s]  Definitions are like children. Pick your favorite.
[5038.84s -> 5050.17s]  A chump, but it's a chimp. Vote for your favorite before this is gone. Vote right now.
[5050.81s -> 5055.37s]  Do you like the sentence where you're stroking your hair to chimp a chimp?
[5058.25s -> 5062.81s]  That kind of pulls it together. The audience likes a loser. And the winning definition is
[5062.97s -> 5078.58s]  I like it too. Nice job, Scoob. Stir. Yeah, 420. If you say that, you should get points deducted.
[5078.58s -> 5084.58s]  I was waiting. Yeah, 420. Chomp, chomp, chomp. This dictionary is hungry for a synonym.
[5086.74s -> 5091.22s]  Write down a new word, something that matches the definition on your device.
[5091.30s -> 5124.07s]  Round two. Here we go. The time is slipping away, so submit your cinnamon.
[5135.54s -> 5137.86s]  Choose the word that best fits the definition.
[5142.86s -> 5151.27s]  Diaper monkey? You just added the word diaper.
[5153.10s -> 5165.00s]  You can't improve on chimp. That's what I was saying.
[5165.00s -> 5169.24s]  Yeah, this is pretty good. It already is. Why would you ever use the synonym on it?
[5169.24s -> 5180.94s]  That person should vote. And the winner is
[5180.94s -> 5183.18s]  None of these are synonyms. Mine vote? What are you talking about?
[5190.90s -> 5194.90s]  You know the drill. Vote on the word that best fits this definition.
[5195.94s -> 5206.15s]  You eat too many trains. What am I looking at?
[5206.71s -> 5213.03s]  It kind of sucks. I don't know what this means.
[5213.91s -> 5219.35s]  Caboose, Caboose. Choo, choo, choo.
[5220.55s -> 5224.55s]  That person did not know how to spell Caboose. Vote, vote, vote. Vote right now.
[5225.19s -> 5229.99s]  Y'all are bad at this. How do you be good with like nonsense?
[5231.96s -> 5235.88s]  It's not even real. Boulder Dash gets the words in real.
[5236.04s -> 5238.20s]  And the winning synonym is
[5241.54s -> 5245.30s]  You know like when someone walks up to a comedian it's like oh you're a comedian tell me a joke.
[5247.22s -> 5250.42s]  This is like doing that but also you have to use a word that doesn't exist.
[5250.42s -> 5252.58s]  Oh I feel that. I feel that.
[5255.74s -> 5258.86s]  In round three you will use the word in a sentence.
[5258.86s -> 5262.78s]  This is your last chance to add to the dictionary of entry so make it count.
[5265.06s -> 5267.30s]  Write a sentence using the word on your device.
[5267.30s -> 5270.42s]  That really is the equivalent of like going to like somebody's house that you're dating
[5270.42s -> 5273.06s]  and meeting their dad for the first time. It's like oh you're funny.
[5273.70s -> 5277.14s]  Like you said tell me a joke son and you're like eating dinner.
[5277.14s -> 5280.58s]  It's not a joke but also use it in a sentence with the word
[5281.30s -> 5285.06s]  Caboose crew. Tell me a joke son. I don't know. Put your fork and knife down.
[5286.10s -> 5289.06s]  I'm gonna throw you out a couple of verbs. Give me a story.
[5290.22s -> 5296.92s]  All right I heard a sentence. Wait this is more like choo choo stuff.
[5297.88s -> 5304.98s]  Die for monkey a lose. This is all wrong.
[5305.78s -> 5320.89s]  That's not even if that's the wrong.
[5323.05s -> 5326.09s]  That's the wrong means of transportation. Whatever.
[5330.02s -> 5333.90s]  Oh man you never finish.
[5334.78s -> 5336.94s]  Let us behold the sentences.
[5341.50s -> 5348.33s]  Near station order their biggest choo-bee but that's not but that's not an item.
[5348.97s -> 5352.41s]  It's rename train gore to choo-bee in my what?
[5353.21s -> 5356.01s]  Kevin was never allowed to play with the other chimps and it was resigned.
[5359.85s -> 5363.29s]  What? Yeah that's like yeah where's mine?
[5367.03s -> 5369.91s]  Where's mine? Train gore wins.
[5369.91s -> 5382.14s]  I didn't censor anything. Like oh my god.
[5384.06s -> 5388.66s]  I love this game. Do you? Yeah this one's good.
[5388.66s -> 5393.62s]  But actually to be honest as much as this one kind of sucks,
[5394.82s -> 5401.22s]  it's so much better than the haunted house thing. Yeah well yeah not hard.
[5405.99s -> 5411.54s]  And the winning sentence is choo-bee my choo-bee.
[5413.06s -> 5417.30s]  Die for monkey. Look at those monkeys son. Oh no that that's the die for monkey. What?
[5420.12s -> 5423.32s]  They were both on the screen. Why is mine gonna be on here?
[5424.28s -> 5431.00s]  Did you pick the wrong one too? Yeah what? See?
[5436.57s -> 5438.73s]  It's fucked up man. It's fucked up.
[5440.01s -> 5444.25s]  So wrong. Dude this chap looked down at the die for monkey.
[5447.21s -> 5453.45s]  This is a verb.
[5464.65s -> 5467.82s]  Who the fuck wrote this? Me.
[5467.98s -> 5474.22s]  Me. You did? The choo-bee at the bus stop is mine. No. No I'm the comedian.
[5474.22s -> 5478.38s]  Which one are you laughing at? Even the chap looked down at the die for monkey.
[5480.06s -> 5482.78s]  I thought you were laughing at mine. That was me.
[5483.98s -> 5486.70s]  I know how to make my words. Yours didn't mean how is that possible.
[5488.70s -> 5497.50s]  What a perfectly fun funky fresh dictionary entry. I'm in awe. Oh my stomach hurts.
[5497.50s -> 5500.38s]  Die for monkey. A loser chimp. Derive from chimp.
[5522.68s -> 5525.32s]  I just found the new word dancing naked in the darkness.
[5529.96s -> 5531.24s]  All right let's do push the button.
[5536.50s -> 5544.17s]  No end of the game songs. Not good ones. All right push the button. Okay.
[5544.17s -> 5549.69s]  This one better be fun or I'm blaming you. Me? Dangerous.
[5549.69s -> 5555.08s]  People said it doesn't work with random people. Oh. Everyone said this is the best one.
[5556.28s -> 5560.66s]  Should we do a one like is it does it just work with the three of us? Oh no it doesn't.
[5560.74s -> 5564.58s]  But people are saying it does. Does this work with three people?
[5565.30s -> 5576.84s]  Does not work with. Oh it has no audience. Oh we would need an extra.
[5577.72s -> 5582.36s]  Everybody somebody who are you? So wait what was wrong? We skipped this one. Why did we skip this
[5582.36s -> 5587.56s]  one? Well the chat said it was dumb. Yeah the chat said the one was very dumb. Should we even just do
[5587.56s -> 5595.64s]  it? Just wait we have the pack. But it's dumb and those other ones are so fun. I want to do
[5595.64s -> 5600.94s]  Dictionarium again now that I understand what's going on. Okay can you guys like not
[5601.90s -> 5607.18s]  define the wrong word and still win? There was two and one on the screen. I wanted to pick one of
[5607.18s -> 5613.58s]  them. You could. You probably just picked the wrong one. We'll plan like another night where
[5613.58s -> 5623.56s]  we can have like four or five people do it. I mean I'm certain Ronnie's not doing anything.
[5624.52s -> 5626.33s]  I just know.
[5629.46s -> 5641.99s]  Do you think we could do that? Is he interested? I'm certain he's interested. There's two things
[5641.99s -> 5653.11s]  I know about him. He's not doing anything and he's interested. Oh okay. It does work with chat.
[5653.11s -> 5659.22s]  People are saying. Does that work? Well let's just try and see why it wouldn't. All right let's just
[5659.22s -> 5664.90s]  see. What's the worst thing we could do is waste time? Summon Ronnie in the meantime. I don't know.
[5666.26s -> 5680.26s]  What is it? Let's see. You need like ten people. People are saying. Ten people? They said four to
[5680.26s -> 5685.78s]  ten. It technically works but everyone needs to talk to each other really. Well I can call. I
[5685.78s -> 5695.83s]  can add Ronnie if we really want him. Well let's just. Wait max players. What if I do okay four?
[5696.79s -> 5710.78s]  Hide the room code. Censoring. Quiet twitch.
[5715.43s -> 5720.14s]  I'm trying not to think about it. Ten sucks you guys are nuts.
[5721.66s -> 5728.04s]  All right well it just is like Ronnie right? Did you like tell him? Yeah he'll yeah.
[5730.12s -> 5734.60s]  If you just if he's just sitting right there then just yeah if you like told him hey let's play then
[5735.24s -> 5742.76s]  yeah then yeah let's go. He's here. Wait Ronnie's here? Yeah. Ronnie. Ronnie.
[5744.44s -> 5754.68s]  Ronnie. Hey. Hello. Hello. All right let's do it. Welcome Ronnie. It's jackbox.tv Ronnie if you
[5754.68s -> 5762.60s]  missed that. The links in the chat. Jackbox.tv yeah. What's uh is the code in the chat yet? No okay.
[5765.93s -> 5770.17s]  Can you see the webcam? Uh yeah yeah I'm looking at the screen right now.
[5770.17s -> 5780.39s]  The screen grab. Let's say gross Fluter. Aw Fluter I love you. Get Kim. Kim is at work.
[5782.14s -> 5796.25s]  Sorry guys. Imagine working. On a Sunday. On a Sunday. Get her anyways. What the fuck. All right
[5796.25s -> 5803.59s]  let me get this set up. Manual censoring in case you know I have to do that. Room code hiding. Max
[5803.59s -> 5809.83s]  plays four. I guess it really doesn't matter. There's this. All right here we go. Play. Push the
[5809.83s -> 5832.28s]  button. I said cake throat. All right uh you guys can see the game right so all I have to do is
[5832.28s -> 5841.40s]  this. Uh don't join it yet when they get in first. No although it really doesn't matter. It's just
[5841.40s -> 5851.42s]  the four of us anyways. Just the four of us. You and I and I and I. Ronnie is fucking infected.
[5851.42s -> 5856.71s]  What? Uh it's making me twitch log in. How do I do that? Here we go. I'll log in real quick.
[5856.71s -> 5867.30s]  Top left setting bar. Yeah yeah yeah. All right here we go. That was easy peasy. All right so uh
[5867.30s -> 5874.20s]  I've we're gonna get a tutorial. We'll see how this works. Let's go. Everybody ready?
[5875.43s -> 5889.58s]  Yep yeah this is MVM music. Oh this one actually is an animated background. That's cool.
[5889.58s -> 5894.38s]  Sorry to interrupt your cryo sleep but I thought it worth mentioning that I your digital officer
[5894.38s -> 5902.34s]  during emergencies or DOTI have detected an alien biorhythm on this ship and just as I suspected
[5902.34s -> 5907.54s]  the aliens uploaded a virus which is slowly deleting my program. I'm here to guide you through
[5907.54s -> 5914.76s]  if you'd like. Uh we should probably figure out what the hell to do. Uh guide me. Fill me dude.
[5914.76s -> 5920.68s]  I'm now initiating security protocol alpha bravo caret which is a series of tests designed to
[5920.68s -> 5930.33s]  evaluate your humanity and reveal any aliens hiding amongst you. I have determined that one of you
[5930.33s -> 5937.30s]  is secretly an alien. Please look at your device and confirm your identity. Your device can tell
[5937.30s -> 5943.22s]  you if you're a human or an alien but not the identities of your fellow players. I'm Satan.
[5945.50s -> 5956.70s]  Figure out who. But my calculations will have 12 minutes before I cease to be so I'd appreciate
[5956.70s -> 5963.10s]  it if you could figure out who the alien is and then push the button. We're trying to be killing
[5963.10s -> 5971.21s]  each other. You will be our first captain. I have repurposed the ship's quarters into unique testing
[5971.21s -> 5976.73s]  areas. I'm pretty proud of it. Choose an available room and your desired participants. Oh drawing
[5976.73s -> 5983.83s]  quarters. You know what's going in there. Fucking artist. Uh let's break out the tablet. Get me in
[5983.83s -> 5995.62s]  here. Wait don't invite Jerma. Hey. All the artists just gonna jerk off. The two artists
[5995.62s -> 6001.22s]  join the drawing room. Yeah let's get drawing. Whoa there's so much dicks. Where's the fucking
[6001.22s -> 6003.54s]  loud talking clown. The drawings are revealed.
[6008.31s -> 6017.91s]  Oh I gotta get my tablet. What are you guys doing in here? Hold on how much time do we have?
[6018.79s -> 6025.53s]  You got like 12 minutes before we all die. How much time do we have to draw? A minute a minute
[6025.53s -> 6031.29s]  and a half. Okay because my tablet I'm trying to get it to work it's not working. I don't understand
[6031.29s -> 6035.69s]  what I'm supposed to be drawing. It says a thing on top of your screen like above the drawing.
[6038.52s -> 6041.64s]  You will understand what I mean when I don't understand what it wants me to draw.
[6041.64s -> 6047.88s]  Get the hurry up button. But when do I hit the hurry button? If you're dawdling with your doodling
[6047.88s -> 6057.16s]  I can't tell who you're doodling. Go. I'm doodling. Doodles doodles doodles. Fast fast fast. Yes that
[6057.16s -> 6079.42s]  is womp ronnie. It is the real womp ronnie. I did it. Okay what did you do?
[6088.02s -> 6091.86s]  Okay sick. And the human prompt was
[6095.98s -> 6097.90s]  and how did the subjects respond?
[6101.02s -> 6107.02s]  Do any of these answers seem suspicious? Keep in mind someone may have gotten a bad prompt
[6107.02s -> 6114.30s]  or they could just be a terrible artist. That's Sean Valjean if he was a um if he was a captain
[6114.30s -> 6120.62s]  of enterprise. I think I think you know how we draw there's like that's how we both draw.
[6120.62s -> 6123.82s]  We're not alien. What am I trying to pick here? You're trying to pick who the alien is
[6124.54s -> 6131.58s]  I think. But why would draw indicate that? What are these what are these are drawing tap the alien
[6131.58s -> 6135.58s]  icon and any responses you don't draw. You're the fucking alien. The player seems to be taking way
[6135.58s -> 6140.06s]  too long to move on. You can tap the hurry up button to speed up the timer.
[6140.06s -> 6142.78s]  We're on the clock here people so let's keep it going. I trust you both.
[6144.38s -> 6148.22s]  I think you just wait out the timer. Oh yeah you can speed it up. I'm speeding it up.
[6148.22s -> 6154.94s]  My tablet still isn't working. I'm very sad. Wait have you been tested? Okay next captain
[6154.94s -> 6159.90s]  you're in charge. All right you're the captain. Okay let's get a move on. Pick another room. Oh
[6159.90s -> 6168.71s]  the clown room. Oh there's less than nine minutes. The alien's the captain.
[6174.90s -> 6180.82s]  Welcome to the writing pod. We'll see who's really good at writing jokes. Answer honestly
[6180.82s -> 6186.02s]  because it will be scrutinized. Okay the alien virus will allow the intruders to get something
[6186.02s -> 6191.38s]  similar but not quite right. When the correct prompt is revealed it will be up to you to
[6191.38s -> 6199.64s]  determine if any seem odd. As time winds down I'll do my best to send the alien some real
[6199.64s -> 6218.01s]  stinkers. It's the least I can do. Okay. So you draw stuff and then the computer. Let's see the
[6218.01s -> 6229.82s]  human prompt. The last movie I saw was. Okay what can we harp on? Look for any written answer that
[6229.82s -> 6240.12s]  doesn't seem quite right and don't forget to hit that suspicion button. It's Ashley. Is that even
[6240.12s -> 6250.78s]  a movie? I think you're supposed to give vague enough answers that like you. I think. Are you
[6250.78s -> 6254.14s]  voting on me as alien? What? Yeah I'm gonna walk over to your room and shoot you right now.
[6254.14s -> 6259.82s]  Alien viruses capabilities. Aliens now have the ability to hack the prompts. I know what movies
[6259.82s -> 6266.70s]  you've watched. Okay. I know what you've seen recently. An alien can select any human and
[6266.70s -> 6273.66s]  secretly give them the alien prompt. To make things worse aliens can choose to help themselves
[6273.66s -> 6279.34s]  and switch their own prompt. I hope you got all of that because there's no way I'm repeating it.
[6279.34s -> 6284.94s]  Dr. Strange came out three years ago. Okay next captain you're in charge. Yeah I just saw it like
[6285.42s -> 6291.18s]  I just watched it. All right here we go. You're picking drawings order. No I'm not.
[6291.18s -> 6303.24s]  Wait I want to go to the place we haven't seen. Husband versus wife. Deliberate off.
[6303.24s -> 6308.52s]  Humans will be given a difficult decision and must choose which answer seems appropriate to them.
[6308.52s -> 6313.80s]  Aliens will see no dilemma and must choose their answers blindly. When the crew sees the full
[6313.80s -> 6318.84s]  statement aliens may have to justify their random selection or face suspicion.
[6321.27s -> 6326.39s]  Make your choice. Let's see what these players choose. If they're an alien I bet it's peculiar.
[6327.11s -> 6338.31s]  Would you like to play a game? Finished. Only seven more minutes. Humans received.
[6340.74s -> 6345.86s]  Every time you eat cheese you destroy a small sentient universe. You must.
[6346.50s -> 6354.81s]  Do any of these seem stinky? Now you have to decide who's an alien or just makes terrible
[6354.81s -> 6359.93s]  life decisions. You must slow down. And don't forget about those alien hacks. A smart alien
[6359.93s -> 6372.01s]  can make someone look suspicious by flipping their prompts. I know that when you say something like
[6372.01s -> 6377.93s]  oh Monopoly is my favorite board game everybody goes holy come on man what about like Settlers of
[6377.93s -> 6385.83s]  Catan. To me like this is the Settlers of Catan version in this game. I kind of want to go back
[6385.83s -> 6394.87s]  to Monopoly. I don't follow. Is the glitching getting worse? I feel like it's getting worse.
[6394.87s -> 6399.43s]  Look at your device. You can now reach the button and take us to the extraction room
[6399.43s -> 6403.75s]  but I would recommend you only do this once you complete your suspicions.
[6403.83s -> 6410.31s]  Okay next captain you're in charge. Because it's Ashley. What? The game's over because
[6410.31s -> 6415.19s]  Ashley's the alien. Star is pretty quick to accuse Ashley. Welcome to the extraction room.
[6415.19s -> 6420.63s]  Check it out I've stopped the timer. It's costing me a lot of cpu but I don't want you to feel rush.
[6420.63s -> 6424.15s]  Since you were the one to push the button. I think we're supposed to be talking to each other.
[6424.15s -> 6429.67s]  You believe is an alien. We are. We're having a fun time. Yeah you're supposed to quiz people
[6429.67s -> 6434.87s]  on what their answers were. If you all vote yes and this player is an alien.
[6437.11s -> 6441.03s]  I'm not the alien. Why would you put me in here? It's curtains for us all.
[6441.03s -> 6445.27s]  This is no no no no no this is where we talk. I am not I'm actually I don't understand how the
[6445.27s -> 6449.19s]  game works but I know that I'm not the alien. She's the one with the button. So why did you
[6449.19s -> 6455.59s]  put me in here? Because I wanted to see how it ends. The crew member who pushed the button
[6455.59s -> 6466.10s]  can no longer push it. I also don't really understand the uh acts. I guess you can change
[6466.10s -> 6472.68s]  captain you're in charge. How do I push the button on someone? I think a lady captain can do some
[6472.68s -> 6479.24s]  stuff. Uh drawing oh I'm gonna go back to the drawing quarters. On my tablet. Just because
[6479.24s -> 6485.18s]  I like drawing but I'm gonna bring oh I suddenly suspicious of stir here. Two players to test oh
[6485.74s -> 6493.26s]  okay. Another drawing test I approve. You guys talked over the instructions. I tried to tell
[6493.26s -> 6513.05s]  their drawings could reveal an alien. Oh I wanted to draw that's okay. Oh yeah oh I can't just like
[6513.05s -> 6518.81s]  make it go really fast. I tried to just like say hurry up so you guys had to go really fast.
[6523.26s -> 6528.30s]  Did I mention that if humans use all of their button pushes without success you lose? Well you
[6528.30s -> 6534.82s]  do. Two total hacks. With four people the ability doesn't hit as hard.
[6535.78s -> 6542.28s]  And you can push the button and vote at any time. Okay I see. Sorry if you heard that
[6542.28s -> 6548.73s]  gulping. It was pretty sexy though. I'm like way down with my oh wait I can submit.
[6549.93s -> 6559.26s]  Yeah yeah hit submit. The prompt humans saw was draw shirtless Abe Lincoln.
[6559.82s -> 6567.66s]  Shirtless. Ashley's has a shirt. Like it's fucking. No see the whole time.
[6567.66s -> 6572.54s]  Ashley's is clearly wearing a shirt. Look at that. That's got a collar on it. I did not say shirtless.
[6573.18s -> 6577.18s]  Oh you're the alien. That's oh.
[6581.27s -> 6591.08s]  Is that how we push the button on her? Alien. Oh you're the alien. I hope you're not wasting
[6591.08s -> 6596.68s]  my time. This is just general Abe Lincoln. He's clearly wearing his clothes. You only get one
[6596.68s -> 6605.72s]  minute so act quickly. Okay yeah I want to yeah. Okay time to vote. Yes. Yeah. Oh come on dudes.
[6606.68s -> 6611.48s]  The vote passed. This is what it's like to be in prison. So is it did we do it?
[6612.20s -> 6614.36s]  Yeah. So I did.
[6616.52s -> 6617.40s]  Because it wasn't me.
[6623.82s -> 6625.82s]  Joking that's. I regret everything.
[6627.74s -> 6628.62s]  Die human.
[6631.22s -> 6637.86s]  Good job idiots. But you're an alien. I'm not. Why'd you draw a shirt? I thought this is just
[6637.86s -> 6643.14s]  the tutorial. You didn't say shirtless on it. Okay I get it. So Ronnie gave you the prompt to
[6643.14s -> 6652.90s]  draw a shirt. Oh yeah I'm dabbing. Let's go. So who was it? It was Ronnie. Ronnie was the alien.
[6656.04s -> 6661.80s]  Because it told me to draw Hamilton and I thought they meant Alexander Hamilton and I drew just a
[6661.80s -> 6665.88s]  dude with a skull patch because I don't know what Alexander Hamilton looks like.
[6666.04s -> 6667.56s]  Protocol zephyr nine.
[6670.68s -> 6675.88s]  It was a play that was popular for like five minutes. We got it this time. Wait are we doing
[6675.88s -> 6681.16s]  it again? Please look at your device and confirm your identity. Your device can tell you if you're.
[6682.12s -> 6685.72s]  All right I'm gonna listen to the instructions. Yeah we need to actually debate each other so
[6685.72s -> 6690.52s]  they can figure it out. You guys were like silent after everything. Hold on that whole time you're
[6690.52s -> 6693.56s]  like it's Ashley. Ashley. Ashley. Just do it. It's Ashley. Skip it. It's Ashley.
[6694.28s -> 6700.94s]  That was the whole last 10 minutes. It wasn't. Ashley and Ronnie were messing with each other.
[6700.94s -> 6704.06s]  Choose an available room and your desired participants. I've got too many windows open.
[6704.94s -> 6713.99s]  Uh operation deck okay. Uh two players to test. I want Jerma versus Dirt. Jerma versus Dirt.
[6713.99s -> 6721.45s]  I actually just got out there. Not the fucking aliens. Answer the question. Turn and get a voice.
[6730.23s -> 6732.07s]  And the prompt for humans was.
[6734.31s -> 6739.27s]  A hacker wants $50,000 or they will release your text messages to the world.
[6739.27s -> 6742.95s]  You would say and this is how the participants responded.
[6753.61s -> 6759.77s]  You don't think you would say like hey I want 50 grand. Like no because I have
[6759.77s -> 6762.25s]  nothing to hide. Well neither do I but what else do they have?
[6764.41s -> 6767.77s]  They have your text messages. They get your text. They're in the cloud. They have everything else.
[6767.77s -> 6771.13s]  They have all the pictures of you like bending over to look at your asshole.
[6771.13s -> 6774.25s]  So they have all the pictures on your phone too and you don't want you don't want people to see
[6774.25s -> 6778.89s]  that. We're on the clock here. For medical reasons. I need to look sometimes. I don't think you're an
[6778.89s -> 6783.05s]  alien. I just think you've got some perverted shit on your phone. You talk a lot of stuff and
[6783.05s -> 6787.93s]  centering people for making. You want to give $50,000. Remember when you were sitting there
[6787.93s -> 6793.13s]  with the bread loaf. I'm just saying if they've got text messages they've got
[6793.13s -> 6797.05s]  they've got like they've got probably bank accounts. They're going to take the 50,000.
[6797.77s -> 6802.33s]  Bring it down to eight and I'll do it. New captain. Give someone eight thousand dollars.
[6806.65s -> 6808.57s]  No you're just a sick sick man.
[6812.92s -> 6821.59s]  Waiting pod. Writing test.
[6822.31s -> 6827.11s]  Oh finally. Write an answer to the comms on your device.
[6832.12s -> 6838.49s]  I bet you're naked under all those clothes. Yeah. What's that guy's name? Forget about under the
[6838.49s -> 6856.42s]  clothes. I'm not even wearing any. That's common knowledge. And here's what humans saw.
[6858.82s -> 6862.34s]  The actor or actress I want to play me in a movie is
[6865.45s -> 6872.49s]  anything odd. Okay that's pretty suspicious. Wouldn't it be awesome
[6872.49s -> 6878.17s]  if Peter Dinklage played me and everyone else in the movie acted like I was still me.
[6879.37s -> 6885.21s]  Yeah but that's I mean and they don't they don't look down to make eye contact with them either.
[6885.21s -> 6888.81s]  They're looking up because like they see me but it's Peter Dinklage.
[6888.81s -> 6893.64s]  Okay so they're definitely not the only one.
[6893.64s -> 6899.48s]  Let's keep it going. What? Why would he not be the? Because all these responses are very honest.
[6900.76s -> 6907.00s]  Yeah but that I mean that's a very clear like mind gymnastics. That's 100% my answer. Like if I had
[6907.00s -> 6912.84s]  the power it's him. Yes. He has to do that role. His agent comes to him with he's like no no god
[6913.40s -> 6921.11s]  they force him to the drawing quarters. Drawing quarters? I don't want to draw.
[6921.91s -> 6926.30s]  I'm sorry you keep getting left out of these German but. That's fine. It's art battle.
[6926.30s -> 6929.82s]  No it actually needs to. Hey thank you. You have entered the drawing quarters.
[6929.82s -> 6934.54s]  All right here we go. That's gotta come up with a grand. Draw the prompt on your device.
[6935.74s -> 6944.36s]  I'm getting hacked. What does it mean when it says total hacks at the bottom?
[6945.37s -> 6948.65s]  Uh I think that's at the amount of times the alien can interfere.
[6949.45s -> 6964.50s]  I wouldn't know. I'm just guessing. If they're taking too long to draw the
[6964.50s -> 6974.23s]  hurry up button can help pick up the pace. Do I get a hurry up button? Oh that's the total.
[6974.23s -> 6979.35s]  It's way at the bottom left for me. Hold on so there's a some whoever the alien is has
[6979.35s -> 6985.45s]  already done two hacks. That's the total amount of hacks total. Not how many you have left.
[6986.70s -> 6990.14s]  Yeah. Somebody is fucking with us. Somebody said no. Is that one guy?
[6991.02s -> 6999.24s]  That's completely wrong. We've only had two. So I had it right the first time so that's the amount
[6999.24s -> 7003.88s]  of hacks that are available. I'll be honest I don't know how the hacks work. I don't know
[7003.88s -> 7012.04s]  what they're for. It's to mix like to make a human get an alien prompt or like switch it around so
[7012.04s -> 7017.82s]  a human looks like an alien. Gotcha. You read it wrong you're the one guy.
[7019.02s -> 7027.51s]  Let's see it in the chat. What the fuck? And the human prompt was
[7029.88s -> 7041.98s]  draw yourself in the future. Oh my god no way. What do we think? I mean Ronnie what's going on
[7041.98s -> 7049.58s]  here? I have no idea. It said draw myself the future and I thought Dragon Ball is just a super
[7049.58s -> 7055.30s]  future. Maybe I'll be I'd have no idea where. Why do you say pulled up? Because I thought once
[7055.30s -> 7061.85s]  after I drew him with his hands up it reminded me of that meme image. The fallout guy. We're
[7061.85s -> 7070.17s]  on the clock here people so let's keep going. Alien. Alien. I don't know I think he's a robot.
[7070.17s -> 7076.63s]  I mean Ronnie would draw himself as Vegeta in the future but the hold up it's not adding up man
[7077.59s -> 7081.67s]  and everyone knows you don't write words when you're doing draw my thing or draw anything.
[7081.67s -> 7086.15s]  That's a good point. And only an alien would not know to not write words.
[7087.51s -> 7093.75s]  Yeah let's stir in my picture. We're on a dolphin. Nice. Also this is really funny to me because
[7093.75s -> 7099.11s]  anytime for years when someone's drawing something I tell them to draw me for the future
[7099.11s -> 7102.55s]  or draw yourself for the future and Ashley got to do it.
[7106.47s -> 7113.27s]  Why can't emergencies have calm alarms? Next captain. I uh I'm gonna go ahead.
[7113.91s -> 7117.35s]  Uh there's a the bio there's whoa hold on a minute here there's a bio scanner.
[7119.02s -> 7132.33s]  What's the bio scanner? Put Ronnie in the scan me. Let's scan him. Come on do it. This is the
[7132.33s -> 7136.97s]  bio scanner. Good luck. I hope you've chosen a team. Oh you didn't put yourself in did you? Captain
[7136.97s -> 7143.05s]  I'm sending you the correct glyphs now. I don't think you can. Wait I gotta hold on I need to
[7143.05s -> 7155.56s]  look at this. Wait what is happening? Uh hold on. Describe your glyphs Jerma. No. Yeah you have to.
[7155.56s -> 7161.72s]  Oh oh oh oh describe the symbols. Okay so all right so we got describe the symbols below that
[7161.72s -> 7172.42s]  that okay so we've got select I got a um Jerma. Hold on person standing at a bus stop is one of
[7172.42s -> 7184.49s]  them. We also have uh the man falling down or man diving and then we also have uh a conjoined a
[7184.49s -> 7195.38s]  conjoined uh conjoined twin conjoined twin so we have man standing at bus stop like actual bus stop
[7195.38s -> 7205.99s]  like the bus stop man falling straight down or diving and then uh conjoined twins okay okay
[7206.87s -> 7217.05s]  all right how we doing you hit a button yeah hurry up i'm done okay what do we got the test has failed
[7217.13s -> 7226.12s]  how did we both get it wrong okay that was suspicious maybe test humans next time
[7229.70s -> 7239.42s]  hold on a second this one's hard okay so might have been it hold on star what he said man diving
[7240.47s -> 7244.71s]  man diving the man falling down diving is the middle one here people so let's keep it going
[7245.75s -> 7251.11s]  me and ronnie have just about the same ones but we were super like yeah i think we were different
[7251.51s -> 7255.83s]  that match what you were saying i think we just differed there yeah the man falling down was the
[7255.83s -> 7262.15s]  one that i didn't quite because mine's pointing my diving of falling down and you have man going
[7262.15s -> 7269.77s]  up in the air you have a man falling down on your panel star why did you not pick it which one is
[7269.77s -> 7277.43s]  the man falling down the one the one literally right next to it on the right which one two headed
[7278.07s -> 7283.35s]  no i'll start on your look at in the middle you have that in the middle you picked the right one
[7283.35s -> 7288.07s]  my middle selected one with the three like fingers going down was my man falling down
[7289.11s -> 7295.03s]  next captain please why is it going up you had one going down there's less than three minutes
[7295.03s -> 7301.91s]  let's not go to the bioscanner again oh we only have two minutes oh oh gosh okay uh drawing i'm
[7301.91s -> 7309.03s]  gonna get germa in on this one and ashlett i'm sorry sir have you even gotten to draw
[7309.99s -> 7320.25s]  i had the previous one okay draw response draw it's germa wait what give me it's like
[7321.29s -> 7334.10s]  it's tiny text above the drawing thing it's real tiny uh ronnie hurry him you have a hurry
[7334.10s -> 7347.14s]  button on the bottom left all right hurry up no no no no get rid of that
[7356.50s -> 7362.54s]  probably stop drawing me so weird is that fun drawing the more details you add
[7364.70s -> 7375.72s]  the more trouble it can get i ran out of time draw a mirror draw a mirror any of these answers help
[7377.56s -> 7386.52s]  uh none of those makes oh i get ashley's i was germa's yeah no no no no no hold on a second here
[7386.52s -> 7392.04s]  i got fucking hacked i got listen to me don't do it yet i got hacked i got hacked i got hacked
[7392.04s -> 7397.72s]  how did you tell you to draw it told me to draw a magic portal isolate since this is our first so i
[7397.72s -> 7403.32s]  was making a guy i was gonna have a magician in there a magic portal why would i draw a big
[7403.32s -> 7408.36s]  circle like that it's ronnie now the non-isolated member how do we how do we pick the guy wait no
[7408.36s -> 7417.40s]  it's germa in there yeah it's him no it's not me you don't write hold up on bajita that's right
[7417.40s -> 7422.84s]  what wait wait wait wait star star why are you why your star is incredibly gung-ho about this
[7422.84s -> 7432.81s]  whole thing why who did you put it this either you were you drew a black hole there's still two
[7432.81s -> 7436.81s]  hacks get star in there no get star in there get him in there unless it doesn't tell you if a hack
[7436.81s -> 7443.46s]  was used no steve's answers were so honest oh no they were not yes they were peter dinklage come
[7443.46s -> 7449.46s]  on peter dinklage yeah absolutely trying to come here to the bus kill him i yeah and it was star
[7449.46s -> 7462.23s]  that good work everybody nice work you killed an innocent man oh i just don't know how the ui works
[7462.31s -> 7463.51s]  to get ronnie in there instead
[7472.60s -> 7477.00s]  we had 20 seconds left in 20 seconds i'm gonna figure out how to get ronnie in that room
[7478.36s -> 7483.64s]  i'll just take a bed and kill germa you could have just voted for me and then uh it would the
[7483.64s -> 7488.84s]  vote would have canceled the vote that i had was no or yes for germa that's all i had then you hit
[7488.84s -> 7493.24s]  no and that would have been in yeah well i mean i figured that's what i'm saying is i don't know
[7493.24s -> 7499.40s]  how long it would have taken to set up the ronnie vote because i don't i don't like this game oh it
[7499.40s -> 7507.19s]  even needs more people yeah i think even harder i think it'd be fun if it was even just two people
[7507.19s -> 7512.41s]  i mean this is still interesting but with like maybe like six people i think would be perfect
[7513.45s -> 7515.61s]  yeah ten people would be too crazy
[7515.61s -> 7521.42s]  so
[7521.42s -> 7527.58s]  why did you write hold up ronnie yeah i don't know i completely flubbed that because it said draw
[7527.58s -> 7535.34s]  yourself it didn't say draw yourself in the future it just said draw yourself because i thought why
[7535.34s -> 7540.38s]  would it make me draw myself i'm the alien it's lying to me i'll draw something else and talk my
[7540.38s -> 7544.94s]  way out of it so i said all right i'll draw vegeta because maybe it'll say what's the last movie you
[7544.94s -> 7549.58s]  saw or something and they're like oh okay i could just say obviously and anything in your life you
[7549.58s -> 7554.54s]  could relate to dragon ball so it was a good play yeah all right uh you guys want to do
[7555.26s -> 7560.14s]  one more before because i gotta get going soon yeah yeah yeah let's do one more of this so you
[7560.14s -> 7564.62s]  want to go back and do like the dictionary one i feel like we need a sort of round two for dictionary
[7564.62s -> 7571.02s]  uh streamer's choice yep yeah i feel hold on let me see streamer's choice do you want me to
[7571.02s -> 7576.62s]  leave for the next one no you're okay i mean you were the alien and killed us all twice
[7577.18s -> 7584.17s]  i said i know i haven't even seen this one is this one really that bad to like not even play it once
[7584.17s -> 7593.67s]  in the in the whole pack why don't we just do it we're gonna do it fine fine i mean we have what
[7593.67s -> 7599.19s]  we're just gonna play jack box six and just skip one of the whole games in here well we gotta put
[7599.19s -> 7603.59s]  a nut in to make the others feel better yeah it's actually okay with four people
[7604.31s -> 7610.39s]  so we just don't just do this with four people don't just have to be a private game it'll be
[7610.39s -> 7618.31s]  worse with chip okay all right screw you chip all right so also your jokes were so
[7618.31s -> 7625.99s]  shit last time i need to do something to like fix this me what those were bad jokes oh my god

[7834.04s -> 7839.80s]  if you have any questions about our process you're not alone here at the lab we've spent
[7839.80s -> 7845.56s]  years searching for the genetic magic that makes each and every human a truly unique individual
[7845.56s -> 7851.24s]  but that was hard so we found a shortcut we theorize every friend group has some version of
[7851.24s -> 7857.40s]  the smart one the popular one the troubled loner who i can change you get all of those
[7857.40s -> 7864.52s]  and these roles make it a lot easier to figure people out with science you guys are going to
[7864.52s -> 7869.64s]  match your fellow test subjects to the roles that fit them best my lovely assistant will
[7869.64s -> 7874.04s]  put all the data into the tubes and at the end we'll crunch the numbers and tell each of you
[7874.04s -> 7881.08s]  who you really are okay i moved all the chemicals out of licking distance so let's go i need a
[7881.08s -> 7885.72s]  category to get us started vote for your favorite but try to make it something everybody knows a
[7885.72s -> 7891.56s]  little bit about everyone knows a little bit about their deepest fears game of thrones that's what i
[7892.12s -> 7897.08s]  oh i might be able to oh i'm gonna smoke you in spice girls you freaking millennials
[7898.36s -> 7909.08s]  um ronnie ronnie i'm 34 which of these is secretly your deepest fear so on your device
[7909.08s -> 7913.64s]  you've got the names of your fellow lab rats drag each one to the room you think fits them best
[7913.64s -> 7918.12s]  you have to drag these to the people you think fits this best you'll see a little 99 sign next
[7918.12s -> 7924.44s]  to each room tap that to lock oh god your 99 will match what everyone else picks i'll make
[7924.44s -> 7928.84s]  it worth your while if you're right so make sure to pick someone when everyone's given out their
[7928.84s -> 7946.92s]  roles we'll check out the results i think i got it i think i got this mail why does it say hold up
[7952.30s -> 7961.53s]  let's see where we landed let's look at those votes get rid of the outliers
[7962.41s -> 7969.58s]  we have our winner is scared of snakes how do you win being scared of snakes i win so i'll give
[7969.58s -> 7975.34s]  you guys these nutritious science pellets whenever your answers match the group whoever has the most
[7975.34s -> 7988.63s]  at the end of the month plus they're a healthy snack subjects who already have a role don't need
[7989.35s -> 7996.47s]  so let's lose these votes stir knows me way too well why did it was two v2
[7997.83s -> 8012.49s]  oh we both know ashley hey given public speeches before i was good

[8029.37s -> 8034.97s]  doing on science pellets just a reminder i'll reward you with pellets when your answers match
[8034.97s -> 8039.45s]  the group or when you do the best in a type breaker experiment keep that in mind if you
[8039.45s -> 8054.58s]  want to be the lab rat of the month what's our next category all right uh next category i don't
[8054.58s -> 8062.65s]  know anything i don't know anything about writing it i got i got way too excited about clicking
[8062.65s -> 8070.09s]  dwarves i'm i i'm only doing this because i know i know them all me too yeah you know them all
[8072.97s -> 8079.53s]  don't give it away sleepy bb bb bb which of the seven dwarves are you don't overthink this
[8080.09s -> 8084.25s]  and remember to tap the 99% most strongly about
[8087.62s -> 8093.14s]  ronnie bashful i think oh yeah you just say well it's just okay let's all follow ashley's answers

[8118.07s -> 8126.52s]  degree go to the road oh i forget this let's see that data does it not seem so white
[8130.28s -> 8134.44s]  you really actually or at least what your friends think wait yeah we we're not supposed to because
[8134.52s -> 8137.24s]  we're not supposed to influence each other without really just picked it
[8138.28s -> 8143.48s]  yeah ashley ruined the whole experiment why'd you go with what i said i didn't you're grumpy
[8143.48s -> 8148.76s]  i made you seriously i wanted to pick yourself as grumpy yeah ashley's grumpy look at her face
[8148.76s -> 8153.80s]  sorry you earned the role with a highly motivating audience bonus i think our control group likes you
[8156.86s -> 8166.39s]  the edge you hate your wifey adopting myself as doc because i'm too smart to follow naming
[8166.39s -> 8182.82s]  conventions oh crap what was the other one all right now don't talk about your answers

[8423.59s -> 8425.59s]  time for another test to see who gets this role
[8429.42s -> 8435.42s]  here's what i want each of you to do who goes first is up to you the other lab rats will
[8435.42s -> 8439.34s]  decide who deserves the role show even if you're not sure you want the role
[8439.34s -> 8444.30s]  i'm handing out science pellets to the winner so do your best it's an experiment man you think
[8444.30s -> 8451.70s]  schrodinger's cat always wants to get in the box are we supposed to be in the same room is that
[8451.70s -> 8456.74s]  what they're assuming i don't have a shirt on i can't do this hold on i don't have no we're not
[8456.74s -> 8463.94s]  no don't turn on your camera it's fine all right all right yeah describe it all right dance i
[8463.94s -> 8469.30s]  crumple down into a ball and lie down in a semicircle and just like kind of shake
[8471.06s -> 8478.81s]  that's a good dance stir um um i hold on 20 seconds i can think uh germa's beating you
[8480.07s -> 8485.21s]  look at him shaking down there on the floor i mean i'm still going he's going nuts you're you
[8485.21s -> 8490.49s]  standing there point out how like every individual acne on my face and say i'm pizza face over and
[8490.49s -> 8499.53s]  over again it's like it's like a face pointing dance that's you being like a self-deprecating
[8499.53s -> 8505.37s]  like psycho according to our disturbingly sentient algorithm the role goes to you what is it pointing
[8505.37s -> 8510.73s]  dance performing the best in this experiment is definitely worth a few science pellets
[8512.71s -> 8513.99s]  just don't spoil your dinner
[8514.23s -> 8525.64s]  um you only got one vote but you're still the best person for this role science can be weird
[8525.64s -> 8534.60s]  what pineapple and our audience control group but you're the wackiest topping you know you're
[8534.60s -> 8540.60s]  the pineapple on that beach you're the one some people like yeah you don't belong in everyone
[8540.60s -> 8549.43s]  hates you here's where we ended up punch punch him punch him punch him one last thing before
[8549.43s -> 8553.11s]  i think i'm winning at being the most predictable let's see if there are any more interesting
[8553.11s -> 8563.34s]  patterns in those roles you judging by your roles you're this and you're also this i'm very
[8563.34s -> 8568.78s]  dependable that makes no sense to our algorithm we're going to find out which quality fits you
[8568.78s -> 8574.54s]  better what's the first thing you look for when shopping for a new car wheels this prompt on
[8574.54s -> 8579.02s]  your device then the other subjects will vote on your response make sure it has wheels
[8580.46s -> 8587.93s]  if it doesn't have wheels you just walk away how many clones can you fit money
[8590.01s -> 8594.97s]  how much money is in the wheels yeah how much money could i fit in the wheels for all my cocaine
[8594.97s -> 8607.82s]  dealing yeah that's what we're working with vote on your devices now read the context make sure
[8607.82s -> 8619.56s]  no puke is that dependable or why that's both of them again give it to me more of i feel like
[8619.56s -> 8625.24s]  wildcard always trumps dependable because you know by its very nature is the wild card trumps
[8625.24s -> 8638.70s]  everything in science we call that a shutout your roles tell me that your polar opposites
[8639.42s -> 8643.10s]  at least in this one extremely specific way we're not leaving
[8646.70s -> 8652.94s]  hello has been retired you are allowed to pick the new universal greeting what is it type an

[8980.07s -> 8986.55s]  oh i see i am in very good company in the dictionary you will make up a dictionary entry
[8986.55s -> 8992.39s]  for a totally fake word there is no right answer but the most popular one wins so stay on your toes

[9108.31s -> 9110.15s]  i don't understand m&m's
[9123.48s -> 9128.36s]  do you not know what m&m's are is that the hold up no it is but why m&m's and baileys
[9129.08s -> 9139.72s]  what's an m&m why not like nostalgic and the winning definition to be recorded forever in
[9139.72s -> 9148.04s]  the because that's the definition now he's winning ego is growing he's winning now let's do it again

[9237.34s -> 9241.82s]  give me another word that could mean the same thing as the definition on your device
[9241.82s -> 9246.30s]  round two goes fast so type type i hate this one because wear shirt is perfect

[10361.38s -> 10367.70s]  you sink into them and they end up just turning into a little bunched up piece of crap whereas

[10373.78s -> 10379.58s]  considering if you sleep on your side and you put your hand under your pillow a fluffy pillow
[10379.58s -> 10384.94s]  you end up with a you know you can get pins and needles in your hand and stuff no it's uh squishy
