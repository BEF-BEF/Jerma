[1.78s -> 14.97s]  Hello, how are you? That's good. That's good. That's good. I'm on time. Of course I am.
[18.01s -> 33.06s]  We've got a day of festivities today. At least a few festivities. Gonna be playing Beam NG Drive,
[36.74s -> 42.82s]  which I was gonna do scary horror stuff today, but I just didn't feel like it. I'll be honest.
[44.10s -> 49.91s]  I just didn't want to do it. So this game's kind of complicated. This is a lot of going on in this
[49.91s -> 53.91s]  game. I don't really know what I'm going to do. Seems like you kind of really need to figure out
[53.91s -> 59.75s]  how to play it first. So this is going to be tutorial Andy for a little while. If it's too
[59.75s -> 65.74s]  complicated for my tiny brain, then I will move on to Webbed. I've been wanting to play Webbed for
[65.74s -> 74.22s]  a little while. You're a coward. You've literally played this game before. I have not played this
[74.22s -> 79.85s]  game before. No, no, no. You're confusing it with every other time I've crashed a car and laughed.
[79.93s -> 84.54s]  I know there's been hundreds of times. Potentially thousands of times.
[87.19s -> 90.39s]  I mean this whole stream you could probably put next to one of the other games where you crash cars
[91.03s -> 98.18s]  and it'd probably be the same stream. It would be the same stream. But first and foremost,
[99.42s -> 109.64s]  well hold on. I have to warn you. I may have fucked this up pretty badly. I may have,
[111.38s -> 116.26s]  well I don't, whatever. I'm gonna wait till there's more than 5k people here.
[116.82s -> 220.15s]  I'm gonna just chill. Give me a second. Hold on. Okay. Hello. I said to get something real quick.
[222.63s -> 234.71s]  Mod check? What? This is a sleep stream? Why would I do a sleep stream? What are you talking about?
[234.71s -> 243.96s]  Let me see. Hold on. I just ran up and down stairs. Hold on. Okay. Laughing at car crash compilation?
[245.86s -> 253.19s]  Let me learn how to play the game first. You guys are going to laugh and I don't,
[253.91s -> 263.98s]  you're going to laugh. Everybody's going to laugh because here's your glove.
[263.98s -> 273.26s]  Fits perfectly. As you see, it fits perfectly. I had this custom fit to make sure I could,
[273.26s -> 285.13s]  you know, wear it. I promise, I promise I didn't sit on it. I didn't sit on this and get really
[285.13s -> 300.30s]  mad and get very upset that I sat on it. I wonder how this glove tastes. Homer Simpson? Is that,
[300.30s -> 324.31s]  what is that? Is that leather? Okay. You sat on it? Now that's fresh leather. What are these
[324.31s -> 334.28s]  gloves even supposed to be made out of? Hold on. Hold on. I wish I had two. This looks like,
[334.28s -> 340.82s]  oh, this looks like fucking SpongeBob got rubbed by a car and I like stole this.
[346.12s -> 363.69s]  Ooh. Ow. Bull, watch out. My thumb. Hold on. Ow. What the hell is he doing?
[364.41s -> 375.30s]  You know what I've realized about this channel? I'm starting to realize it more and more.
[375.30s -> 383.06s]  If you don't watch every single fucking stream, you're just, you're not going to have any idea
[383.06s -> 389.18s]  what's going on. I like feel bad for the people that like I catch like a stream once every like
[389.18s -> 396.81s]  couple of weeks. What the fuck are you doing? Stop. What are you doing? Stop this. Pretty good.
[401.85s -> 410.30s]  I can't make a middle finger. There's not five fingers. You have more lower than Dark Souls.
[410.30s -> 413.58s]  I don't think that's accurate. I just think that there's weird shit that happens like every other
[413.58s -> 434.39s]  day. What finger should I bite next? Put your middle finger through the middle. Yeah. Hold on.
[434.39s -> 449.30s]  You know what? Yeah. Fuck you. It's too hard to do it. Uh, flipped. Get the pinky. That's pinky
[449.30s -> 456.23s]  right here, right? Looks like I have like egg in my mouth. All I didn't tell you is it's made
[456.23s -> 471.83s]  out of fucking eggs. Oh, it looks like egg. Hmm. What is that? Is that edible? Boy, I think that's
[471.83s -> 489.61s]  not edible. I don't think that part's edible. That part's not edible. I think that's stuffing.
[489.61s -> 496.26s]  There you go. Okay. All right. I ate another glove. Okay. All right. I'm done. I'm done. I'm out.
[496.26s -> 510.31s]  I'm done. Wait, I got one more, one more bite for the camera. I'm not eating at all. What about
[510.31s -> 519.13s]  like, I can't swallow this. It's fucking pure sugar. I mean, pure leather. I just spit this out.
[519.13s -> 533.64s]  Oh, I'm gonna puke. I'm not eating the whole glove. I'm not eating the whole glove. I'm taking a few
[533.64s -> 542.78s]  bites. I didn't eat the whole shoe. You guys didn't hear that, did you? I hope not. I didn't eat the
[542.78s -> 560.46s]  whole shoe. Why would I eat the whole glove? Come on. I can't. Okay. How about like right here? This
[560.46s -> 565.06s]  looks so fucking weird. Give him the silent treatment. He has to finish the glove. I'm not
[565.06s -> 576.94s]  finishing the glove. I'll take one more bite right here for the thumbnail. Like, this is
[576.94s -> 582.98s]  fucking weird. Don't give me the silent treatment. Give me something else. By the way, I'm never,
[582.98s -> 587.72s]  I'm never saying this again. I was, if you're curious what's going on, let me just explain
[587.72s -> 591.69s]  real quick for people who have no idea what's going on. I was convinced that the three stooges
[591.69s -> 596.17s]  were going to be in Fortnite. Two years ago, I made a bet. I said the three stooges will be in
[596.17s -> 602.49s]  Fortnite by some, what, last week of April, 2022. It didn't happen, which is horseshit. Like, I don't
[602.49s -> 606.57s]  know why they wouldn't have been added. They probably will get added. I still believe that.
[606.57s -> 613.18s]  I genuinely believe the three stooges are going to be in Fortnite. I believe it genuinely. It's
[613.18s -> 618.62s]  just a matter of time. So look, you can come back to this video whenever the three stooges get added
[618.62s -> 622.46s]  and be like, holy shit, he actually had to eat that glove thing and they actually got added.
[622.46s -> 635.83s]  But if the three stooges are not added to Fortnite by April 3rd of 2030, I will have already been
[635.83s -> 645.06s]  retired. So who cares? Okay. Goodbye. My hands are so sticky. I'll be right back. I'll be right back.
[645.06s -> 653.03s]  We'll go back to the intro. I'm going to put this in the freezer. Yeah. I'm going, I'm going to the
[653.03s -> 660.60s]  freezer. I'll be back. I'm so, oh, this is bad. I can't touch anything. Yeah, I can. Here we go.
[660.60s -> 888.66s]  Okay. Hi. Everything's, I just, my hands are all sugar all over them. This was a very sugary
[888.66s -> 910.31s]  leather glove. Okay. You ate a glove? Yeah. You missed it. It was crazy. Yeah. So we're doing
[910.31s -> 918.60s]  BMNG. Uh, I know people are saying, dude, you gotta, oh, BMNG, man. I'm gonna go get this mod
[918.60s -> 921.88s]  and go get that mod and go get that to download that thing. I go download that car pack and get
[921.88s -> 927.56s]  this. Let's start. Look, I'm, this is baby steps. I never played this. Let me just see if I enjoy,
[927.56s -> 935.10s]  I'm going to do the tutorial. I'm going to get familiar with the controls, uh, and we'll see
[935.10s -> 948.36s]  what happens. Understand? It has car accidents. Oh, of course. Of course. If the three stooges were
[948.36s -> 962.79s]  still around, would they be fans of your stream? No. Why would they even know who I was? They would
[962.79s -> 969.42s]  watch dollhouse and go, I could have done that better. Look at these kids think they're so funny
[969.42s -> 978.09s]  these days. You went through a window. I used to go through a window every Saturday. Really? This
[978.09s -> 987.67s]  younger generation doesn't understand slapstick comedy. All right, so let's go. We're going to
[987.67s -> 991.99s]  play BMNG. Uh, if the game is too complicated for me, if I want to pivot, we're just going to
[991.99s -> 1000.01s]  pivot to webbed, which is a spider game. And we play as a spider. It looks pretty cute. You know,
[1000.57s -> 1009.45s]  how did your stomach feel after the last stream? It was, I was okay. I mean, it was a little,
[1010.68s -> 1015.80s]  it was a little, but it wasn't that bad. I didn't eat that much of each candy. I only had one or
[1015.80s -> 1019.64s]  two bites of each thing. I've always eaten whole candy bars. Then. Oh yeah. I would have, I probably
[1019.64s -> 1028.20s]  would have felt terrible. Okay. So BMNG, that's the camera's way too big. This is trouble. I haven't
[1028.20s -> 1035.26s]  had, I've been doing Cam Andy recently. You notice that? This is the most I've ever used
[1035.26s -> 1044.87s]  face cam in the 10, 12 years I've been doing this. I just don't do this. And I never use this.
[1044.87s -> 1049.64s]  And for some reason after Elden Ring, it just became, I just got used to turning it on
[1049.64s -> 1056.60s]  every day. Where's blood wash? I wanted to chill. I wanted to chill today and it's too scary. We'll
[1056.60s -> 1060.20s]  do that a little bit later. We'll do that like next week. Not next week, like later this week.
[1060.20s -> 1064.79s]  We'll do that later this week. I have it downloaded. I have it ready to go. I just,
[1064.79s -> 1070.98s]  I didn't want to just be screaming. My head kind of hurts. All right. Campaign. I need to do the
[1070.98s -> 1075.14s]  driver's training course because I have no idea what the hell I'm doing. So bear with me.
[1076.23s -> 1086.92s]  Senseless destruction? All right. Driver training. This game takes like 5,000 horsepower to run,
[1086.92s -> 1093.06s]  right? Hopefully my computer is going to handle it. I can use a controller for this, right?
[1093.06s -> 1106.49s]  It's all CPU. My CPU is all right. Okay. Accelerating and braking. Welcome to the
[1106.49s -> 1112.02s]  ETK Driver Experience Center. My name is Mike and I'll be your instructor for this course.
[1112.02s -> 1115.14s]  Let's start out nice and easy. All you have to do is accelerate and then stop before you hit the
[1115.14s -> 1123.14s]  barriers. Make sure you brake when you reach the stop sign. Okay. How do you accelerate?
[1123.14s -> 1140.97s]  Apparently using arcade gearbox behavior. What the fuck does that mean? Is it X? Orbit. How do I do it?
[1140.97s -> 1150.01s]  I thought it's not right trigger or left trigger? Press Q. Realistic behavior. Arcade behavior.
[1150.01s -> 1170.34s]  How do you drive? Up? How do I drive? What happened? What? All right. So I was paused. All right. So
[1170.50s -> 1174.90s]  right trigger is accelerate. Left trigger is brake. So brake right before I get here.
[1182.07s -> 1194.95s]  Did I do it? What? How did I fail? That doesn't make any sense. What? Too slow? I was driving so
[1194.95s -> 1204.90s]  insanely fast. That was scary how fast I was going. Oh, we didn't want you to... We wanted you to go
[1204.90s -> 1219.74s]  over 60. So start braking now. What the fuck? I don't get it. I don't get it. What does it want
[1219.74s -> 1231.93s]  me to do? Stop at the stop sign. What? Do you want me to stop like at the stop sign like here?
[1231.93s -> 1242.26s]  That's where the stop sign is. What do you want me to do? I stopped at the stop sign.
[1245.02s -> 1253.86s]  Stop before you hit the barriers. I didn't... I did that the first time. I actually did that the
[1253.86s -> 1259.93s]  first time. Stop in the zone. I just literally just did that. I just did that. I just did that.
[1267.11s -> 1272.26s]  I did that already. All right. All right. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I literally just
[1272.26s -> 1276.42s]  did that. I literally, literally, literally, literally, literally, literally just did it.
[1276.42s -> 1282.79s]  Yeah, I did. I went and stopped in the middle and said, failure. You're an idiot. This isn't
[1282.79s -> 1288.07s]  a real fucking driving game. Give me a real course and I'll be fine. Okay. In the unlikely
[1288.07s -> 1291.99s]  event that the road is not straight, you may need to stop accelerating and use your car's steering
[1291.99s -> 1301.27s]  wheel. Okay. Try it here on the roundabout, but watch out for the slippery area. Just drive the
[1301.27s -> 1322.41s]  car. This is part of the fucking driving test. Yeah. We want you to go 60 and then smash on the
[1322.41s -> 1328.22s]  brakes before you get to the driving zone. Go around this roundabout going 50. All right.
[1328.22s -> 1342.54s]  Go. You're gonna move the cam so we can see the speedometer. Oh, oops. Get up here. All right.
[1342.54s -> 1346.46s]  So you master the turning left. Can you navigate a narrow road? Try to find the proper speed for
[1346.46s -> 1367.51s]  those tight corners. Two, one, go. I fucking failed already. Time limit doesn't matter. I'm
[1367.59s -> 1382.55s]  being timed. All right. Is there a handbrake? In all driving games, I never use the actual brake.
[1382.55s -> 1390.52s]  I use handbrake only. Anybody else like that? R1? Yeah. I only use the handbrake in video games.
[1393.06s -> 1397.27s]  I don't think I've ever hit left trigger in a video game when it's a car game. Okay. So
[1397.27s -> 1410.12s]  handbrake. Got it. How much was the glove? You'd like to know. Changing lanes at highway speeds
[1410.12s -> 1414.12s]  require a gentle hand on the steering wheel. Do you have what it takes to control an 80s supercar?
[1424.62s -> 1428.78s]  Apparently not. What the fuck was that? Why is it covered in like grease?
[1429.42s -> 1457.64s]  I did it. That was easy. Well done. Who made the glove? I told you. I was gonna just like
[1457.64s -> 1462.71s]  fucking ruin everybody's childhood. I was gonna say, I told you. SpongeBob got run over and I
[1462.71s -> 1470.14s]  found it. But no, that's not what happened. It was great. It was fake. It was a real glove. Shut up.
[1470.14s -> 1489.85s]  Stick to the speed limits on the signs to guarantee success. Okay. 25 miles per hour. Okay.
[1490.57s -> 1500.62s]  25 still? I think so. It's all right. I didn't fail it. I didn't fail it. I didn't even get
[1500.62s -> 1524.38s]  bumped. I'm fine. Too realistic. It's too realistic. Why would I be doing this in this car, by the way?
[1524.38s -> 1530.60s]  This is dad's cigarette car. I mean, this is just the car that just smells like cigarettes.
[1530.60s -> 1540.81s]  This is the dad's cigarette car. How did I fail it? What did I do wrong? Is there a time limit?
[1540.81s -> 1550.78s]  What happened? What happened? I don't understand. Read the signs. 25. That's what I was just doing.
[1555.51s -> 1573.99s]  40. Dude, it's fucking hard. Hold on. Guaranteed my success. That was actually really hard to do
[1573.99s -> 1586.94s]  that. This car sucks. It's actually hard. I can't even turn. All guaranteed success at 40 miles per
[1586.94s -> 1602.55s]  hour. 40 miles per hour drifting? That's not gonna happen. Okay. 25. I'm not going 40 through this.
[1602.55s -> 1618.33s]  That's way too fucking much. That's impossible to go 40 through this. 50? Guys, it's not possible.
[1618.33s -> 1636.12s]  It's not possible to go 50. And look at my fucking serious. Whatever. Just start over.
[1636.12s -> 1655.06s]  Fuck it. Whatever. I wasn't going 60, dude. What? I have to drift. Okay. Drift? How do you drift?
[1660.46s -> 1665.42s]  I am holding. Okay. I am literally holding right and like drifting into it and he just drives
[1665.42s -> 1687.61s]  straight into the wall. I'm gonna fail this tutorial. I don't get this. Okay. 40. Big drift.
[1688.25s -> 1702.46s]  Why did you give me this piece of shit car? Okay. 50. It's the car's out of fucking control. It's
[1702.46s -> 1714.39s]  out of control. The car is out of control. I can't control the car. This fucking thing's out of
[1714.39s -> 1731.26s]  control. I can't control it. Did I do it? All right. Good. It's a skill issue. That's fine.
[1731.26s -> 1736.86s]  It is. I don't hand run. I've set up a circuit for you to practice what you've learned. Should
[1736.86s -> 1774.58s]  be pretty easy. Two laps. No surprises. I have to beat this? No, I don't. All right. I'm good.
[1775.06s -> 1794.84s]  Fuck you. God damn it. All right. I'm going too fast. There are no posted speed limits here.
[1794.84s -> 1818.23s]  So how am I supposed to know what the fuck to do? I'm hand braking. It's not working. All right.
[1818.23s -> 1853.70s]  Slow down. Slow down. Okay. I'm good. Good. All right. I got it. That's it. Right. Nice. All right.
[1853.70s -> 1867.00s]  I'm good. Stop hand braking. All right. Hair pins. No fucking way. I'm not gonna be able to do this.
[1867.00s -> 1873.69s]  Hold the handbrake to slide around a hairpin. Just like in the movies. Not with a car like this.
[1875.19s -> 1903.69s]  Listen to my calls. I'm going too fast. Okay. What? 30? 20 miles per hour? That's not in the
[1903.69s -> 1914.87s]  movies. They don't go 15 miles per hour in the movies. There it is.
[1922.73s -> 1968.87s]  What? I fucking... How am I supposed to go that fast? Go! Got it. Very cool.
[1968.87s -> 1978.86s]  What do you do in this game? Slalom. A slalom course is a hard thing to master. Get a feel
[1978.86s -> 1993.30s]  for the weight of the car as you weave between the cones. He's gonna rage at this game. I thought
[1993.30s -> 2019.99s]  I was gonna get points off. Not fail completely. Oh, just barely. I want a car like that. Go get
[2019.99s -> 2032.31s]  mods. I'm... Rear wheel drive handling. Ruckle moonhawk handles like a boat. So if you can finish
[2032.31s -> 2039.19s]  a lap of this circuit first try, you're doing better than most of my students. All right.
[2039.19s -> 2049.69s]  Don't get mods. I'm not gonna yet. How the fuck do you drive a car like this? This car's on treads.
[2049.69s -> 2078.57s]  It's not even on wheels. I just drive straight. The mirror. Oh my god. How are you supposed to
[2078.57s -> 2090.46s]  drive this car? How do you actually drive a car like this? This thing's on ice. This car's on ice.
[2091.66s -> 2114.55s]  I can't drive it. Okay. I'm just gonna go really slow. Use the rear brakes? What? All right. Rear
[2114.55s -> 2143.61s]  brakes. What do you mean rear brakes? I don't know what that means. I'm all right. I've had a fucking
[2143.61s -> 2153.26s]  time. This thing sucks. This thing sucks. Ride driving. Well, this car is impossible to use.
[2153.26s -> 2189.98s]  What the fuck, dude? Why would anybody drive this? I fuck... I'm skipping. I'm done. I'm not playing
[2189.98s -> 2195.85s]  that one. No fucking way. It's not happening. Like, why would you drive that car? Oh man,
[2195.85s -> 2203.58s]  that's a beauty. How often do you drive it? Well, when you want to get in the car with me,
[2203.58s -> 2210.47s]  we'll take a ride. And you just literally drive directly into the first wall. Well,
[2210.47s -> 2215.48s]  I didn't even read that. Whatever. I wasn't gonna make a joke, but I was like, no, why even make a
[2215.48s -> 2247.21s]  joke? That car's not even worth making a joke about. I don't care. This sounds like a cat.
[2247.77s -> 2255.75s]  I'm just braking all the way. I'm going to a complete stop and driving the car again.
[2255.75s -> 2270.15s]  This is so bad for the car. I'm supposed to be drifting. God damn it. Skip it. Stop accelerating
[2270.15s -> 2274.71s]  so hard. I don't play games like this. I play like fucking Mario Kart. I don't even play that
[2274.71s -> 2278.63s]  game. I don't like that one either. I don't play games with cars in them. Unless I like the...
[2278.63s -> 2284.62s]  Unless it's like GTA. All right. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's this?
[2284.62s -> 2290.38s]  Use a manual transmission for this test. Stay in second gear. Slide the car sideways to score as
[2290.38s -> 2302.44s]  many points as you can. All right, let's go. Why am I going backwards? Why is the car in...
[2302.44s -> 2349.54s]  Oh, the car's in reverse. I forgot it was manual. I forgot it was manual. Yeah. Yeah.
[2350.34s -> 2363.90s]  That's not a man-sized drift. Oops. I don't give a shit. That was fine. All right. Campaigns.
[2363.90s -> 2371.48s]  Senseless destruction. Go back. Go back. All right. Somebody said just do free roam. Oh, okay.
[2374.09s -> 2386.71s]  Where do I go? West Coast, USA. Dockyards, industrial area. Just like Chinatown. What should I...
[2386.71s -> 2404.20s]  Just default. Okay. Well, I didn't know what I just did. I hit A too much fast. I pressed A and I
[2404.20s -> 2425.27s]  didn't do anything. This is bright. Retract bed. Extend feet. Tilt bed up. Whoa. Okay. Hold on.
[2425.27s -> 2442.84s]  I'm trying to go over the sand jump. How do I fix the car? Okay. This thing is fucked. What do I do?
[2443.56s -> 2462.60s]  Can I fix the car? How do I fix it? Press R. Oh, okay. Left on the D-pad. Oh, all right. Cool.
[2462.60s -> 2490.09s]  You're a bus? Holy shit. I was ejected. I was ejected from the fucking car. This is still
[2490.09s -> 2501.03s]  drivable. Oh my God. What the hell was that? I got ejected in an escape pod. You got vaporized.
[2501.03s -> 2506.74s]  All right. We'll put on traffic. How do I put traffic on? Use your steering wheel. I just was
[2506.74s -> 2516.95s]  like curious. What's going on? Hit escape. Is it... Oh, hold on. Manage. Fun stuff. Fire. Boom. Break.
[2516.95s -> 2539.32s]  Extinguish. Oh, this is a jump right here. No, no, no. I thought I was gonna be able to drive over it.
[2538.95s -> 2548.36s]  All right. What? How do I get rid of that? No, no, no, no. Power. Pedestrian. I don't want to put
[2548.36s -> 2565.53s]  pedestrians on. No, powertrain. Manage. Clone. Home. AI. Traffic. Spawn. Police. Spawn. Normal.
[2566.09s -> 2585.48s]  Wait, this traffic? Where are they? Change cars? Yeah. How do I get out of this fucking pickup?
[2585.48s -> 2591.72s]  I don't want to be on a pickup truck. You can fuck with gravity too. Really? Is there a different
[2591.72s -> 2604.06s]  camera? How do I get a different camera? Is there a different camera? Vehicle camera. Orbit. Turn
[2604.06s -> 2621.18s]  the police on. If they press escape. Manage. Switch. Or select. Holy shit. Okay. What else is here?
[2621.18s -> 2651.64s]  I can be in a tractor trailer? What? Oh my god. Okay. I want this one. Argo doors. Is it... Oh.
[2652.20s -> 2668.95s]  How do I do that? Check the controls. Yeah. I'll check them. So where should I go? I just...
[2671.56s -> 2675.40s]  Can I like just sit and watch the camera? Can I hold control?
[2675.40s -> 2687.06s]  I feel like I'm playing GTA V. I'm... I can't... I'm not in control anymore.
[2695.50s -> 2705.16s]  This feels so... All right. Reset. Reset. Give me... I want a different car. I want a fast car.
[2705.16s -> 2742.55s]  Okay. I want... Wait a minute. I can... Hello? Did I... Did I just run that guy over?
[2742.55s -> 2748.23s]  I just ran that guy's whole car over. Hold control and put your mouse over the car.
[2752.74s -> 2765.30s]  What? Okay. Am I gonna drown? Hold control. Put your mouse over the car? Strength. Force.
[2765.30s -> 2779.53s]  I'm so confused. Strength. Force. Middle click to hang from here. I'm in the water dude. Why are you
[2779.53s -> 2798.98s]  beeping at me? I don't get it. What? What? I can just pull shit off the car? Like it's a Lego set?
[2810.47s -> 2855.19s]  Excuse me? Use the scroll wheel. What the fuck? Oh. Stay here. Stay here. What am I doing to this car?
[2855.19s -> 2874.58s]  Okay. Now pull this way too. Holy shit. Drive while tethered to the ground.
[2892.57s -> 2899.93s]  High clutch temperature? Clutch overheating. I just burnt out the clutch.
[2904.62s -> 2929.86s]  Okay. But should I try a different car? Okay. Give me a fucking... This is crazy. I didn't know
[2929.86s -> 2940.58s]  this game was like this. Fog light? Okay. Manage. Select new car. Something small and fat. Are there
[2940.58s -> 2954.17s]  motorcycles? All right. This one right here. Yeah. Right here. Let's go. Fucking Robin's egg blue.
[2954.57s -> 3002.76s]  Oh yeah. Hell yeah. The jumps and stuff? Put on slow-mo. Whoa. How do I do slow-mo? Give me a
[3002.76s -> 3012.86s]  redo it. Go a hundred thousand miles per hour. What? You can go a hundred thousand miles per hour?
[3013.66s -> 3017.42s]  Let me just... Hold on. There's a lot going on in this game. Let me get on the highway.
[3017.98s -> 3029.48s]  Drive a GPS. You should just leave the planet. Alt and down. Alt down. Eight times slower than real
[3029.48s -> 3067.98s]  time. What? Alt up. Holy shit. Okay. Let me get on the highway. How do you beep the horn? Oh. No,
[3067.98s -> 3077.85s]  no. I need to go faster than that. No. I don't want to be back here. I don't want to be back here.
[3077.85s -> 3092.23s]  I want to be back up with that error. How do I do a flip? Add a ramp. Okay. Set home. Clone.
[3092.31s -> 3116.23s]  Does it have AI? Okay. Manage. Okay. Select. Wall. Mat. What should I put up here? How about a cannon?
[3116.23s -> 3124.79s]  Oh, here we go. I need a ramp. Hamster wheel. Oh, hell yeah. How do I move this? Okay. So,
[3124.79s -> 3146.57s]  how do I... Can I move this? How do I pick up a car? All right. I need to get in there.
[3146.57s -> 3160.71s]  Is it going to work? Oh my God, dude. You can't drive over the curb because the car is too low
[3160.71s -> 3177.05s]  to the ground. Are you fucking kidding me? God damn it. All right. Just give me the other
[3177.05s -> 3183.42s]  fucking car. Give me the other car. I don't... What the fuck? This is a debug menu? What can I do
[3183.42s -> 3193.24s]  with this? All right. Can I actually use this for other crazy shit? Can I actually do it?
[3194.36s -> 3220.28s]  What can I do with that? SV cheats? All right. Get me up here. Way too dang. These cars cannot
[3220.28s -> 3232.01s]  go... Okay. Oh, there's another entrance. I feel like I'm playing in the bowling alley. I'm playing
[3232.01s -> 3239.26s]  fucking with the bumpers on the other side. I can't go anywhere with this car. This is ridiculous.
[3240.33s -> 3264.62s]  Reverse over it. What the fuck is happening? Am I out on the street? Huh?
[3272.47s -> 3288.82s]  Going to free cam mode. Control C. Oh, nice. All right. Here we go. Dude, you've really... These
[3288.82s -> 3297.56s]  cars are terrible. These cars can't do anything. This is just a giant toy that sits in your garage.
[3297.56s -> 3339.14s]  I can't actually use this. Here we go. It's going faster. Oh shit. Oh my God. It's going so fast.
[3344.65s -> 3357.77s]  Oh, I am going full throttle. High clutch temperature. What does that mean? How do I
[3357.77s -> 3391.29s]  stop that? Hit the brake. Was it control? What's the get to free cam? How do I get to free cam?
[3399.06s -> 3417.88s]  I'm stuck in here. Control C. That's driver cam. F7? Shift C. Okay. I'm in free camera.
[3418.60s -> 3453.96s]  I'm in free camera. No. Okay. I think that's pretty good view. How do I... What's the horn? I... Engine
[3453.96s -> 3465.22s]  oil is... I can't even turn. That just scared the fuck out of me. I don't know what to do about this.
[3465.22s -> 3483.88s]  Where's the other car? There's another car somewhere. Oh, what happened? What? How did I
[3483.88s -> 3496.66s]  miss that? What just happened? I thought I was driving another car. What's going on? I'm driving
[3496.66s -> 3520.06s]  the hamster wheel. I'm driving the wheel. Are you serious? What the fuck are you talking about?
[3520.06s -> 3532.70s]  All right. Let's put a Mac truck in here. I'm going to put a Mac truck in here. Can I spawn
[3532.70s -> 3555.85s]  like 10 cars in here? All right. How many can I spawn? Just keep pressing it? Oh, what? Come on.
[3555.85s -> 3581.46s]  Get over here. Remove traffic. Damn it. Oh my fucking God. I just want to... What is all this?
[3581.46s -> 3595.42s]  What do I hit? Tuning? This is insane. I don't... I just want to pick the car up. There we go. No,
[3595.42s -> 3630.42s]  give me a... Give me the car. All right. Stay in there. Oh, I need another one. Okay. Is this
[3630.42s -> 3669.22s]  going to work? Stop doing that. Oh shit. I screwed it up. Hold on. I'll get it in there. Why? I'm just
[3669.22s -> 3682.65s]  taking pieces off. Okay. Here we go. Now I want to go control this. What am I controlling? Okay.
[3682.65s -> 3737.16s]  Here we go. Ready? This is going so fast. F7, please. What's F7 do? F7. What happened? All right.
[3737.16s -> 3744.22s]  Let me drive the bus. There's no way this still drives the fucking way. All right. Let me drive
[3744.22s -> 3768.70s]  the bus. I want to go to the other area. Switch to the other map, the grid map. If you go under 50,
[3768.70s -> 3792.22s]  you're going to explode. This game is so weird. That didn't even hurt me. This thing is indestructible.
[3792.22s -> 3810.31s]  Left shift. What do I mean? Use the... This guy's mad. That's kind of rude. That's just really rude.
[3810.87s -> 3823.11s]  Switch to the grid map. How do I switch to the grid map? What's grid map? Oh, we're going off
[3823.11s -> 3848.50s]  this right now. Really? It's a different map. Okay. Hold on. Let me go off this. Is there... How do I...
[3848.50s -> 3874.57s]  Can I just like go... I want to like... Hold on. Can I make the camera follow? How do I make the
[3874.57s -> 3883.27s]  camera follow from here? It's F7? Why would you tell me to do that? What the fuck did you do that
[3883.27s -> 3902.62s]  for? Now I have to go back? What is... What are these other cars? Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait,
[3902.62s -> 3913.14s]  wait. Recam, right? So if I do that again, it should spawn up here. Wait, I'm spawning it on top?
[3913.14s -> 3942.86s]  Hold on. Can I actually drive it up here? No. Okay. Here we go. I need to set this as my home, right?
[3942.86s -> 3948.89s]  Set home. Yep. Okay. Here we go. All right. Now I want to... I want to go like this, but I want the
[3948.89s -> 3957.91s]  camera to follow from here. I don't think I can do that. I'm just going to get a crazy view. All
[3957.91s -> 3996.66s]  right. Let's see if I can make it down over there. You know, I think I'm doing a pretty good job,
[3996.66s -> 4024.25s]  if I have to say so myself. Craziest fucking security camera. Like, what was this guy doing?
[4024.25s -> 4065.11s]  What was this guy doing? Am I still going? What? How am I still going? How did... Honest to God?
[4065.11s -> 4076.87s]  How did I do all that? That's... I don't even know how I did all that. That makes no sense.
[4076.87s -> 4091.03s]  Wait, the bus is still driving. Press 1 through 9. Oh, this is what I wanted. This is what I
[4091.03s -> 4109.05s]  wanted so badly. This is the only thing I care about in this whole game. It says not in service
[4109.05s -> 4131.35s]  on it. That's so funny. You know, this is what would happen. There's nobody in this car. This
[4131.35s -> 4137.90s]  is what would happen if this bus became sentient right now. It would just be like, what am I doing?
[4137.90s -> 4141.34s]  Where am I? Why am I alive? What's happening? It would start crashing into shit. It wouldn't know
[4141.34s -> 4150.06s]  what to do. It would be freaking out. This is what would happen. This is the future that Tesla
[4150.06s -> 4156.57s]  wants. This car is alive right now and it doesn't get it. It doesn't understand what life is.
[4157.21s -> 4162.63s]  It has no idea what life is. All it knows is that it can move this forward. It can move forward.
[4162.63s -> 4189.78s]  That's it. It doesn't know anything else. It doesn't know anything. It doesn't know anything.
[4191.32s -> 4197.54s]  I must drive. I don't know. I just have to go forward. I just have to push the forward button.
[4198.42s -> 4200.02s]  Who am I?
[4247.26s -> 4268.41s]  It's too much. Way too... it's way too day. Oh wait. I had the wrong one on.
[4269.75s -> 4288.36s]  I can't breathe!
[4288.36s -> 4290.36s]  Something feels weird in my lungs!
[4290.36s -> 4294.18s]  Why do I have lungs? Why do I have-
[4294.18s -> 4307.54s]  OW! OW!
[4307.54s -> 4310.42s]  Somebody said his jigsaw!
[4310.42s -> 4320.22s]  I'm going to break you up!
[4320.22s -> 4322.78s]  Bus it seems. This bus
[4322.78s -> 4324.78s]  is not like any other bus you've ever driven.
[4324.78s -> 4327.46s]  This bus must go
[4327.46s -> 4329.46s]  at least 40 miles per hour
[4329.46s -> 4331.96s]  just like that movie.
[4331.96s -> 4335.22s]  If this bus goes below 40
[4335.22s -> 4337.22s]  I'll hide your
[4337.22s -> 4339.22s]  tonal clippers and your tweezers in your house.
[4339.22s -> 4341.22s]  You won't be able to find them.
[4341.22s -> 4343.53s]  You'll be a huge pain in the ass and you'll have to
[4343.53s -> 4346.60s]  buy a new pair of tweezers
[4346.60s -> 4348.60s]  every time you go to the store.
[4348.60s -> 4350.60s]  It's really fucking annoying.
[4350.60s -> 4352.60s]  Whoa whoa whoa! Are you alright?
[4352.60s -> 4354.78s]  You okay?
[4354.78s -> 4361.93s]  You okay? Oh what the
[4361.93s -> 4369.85s]  fuck? He's fine.
[4369.85s -> 4371.85s]  And remember, if that goes below 40
[4371.85s -> 4375.75s]  miles per hour, you
[4375.75s -> 4377.75s]  hold on, I can't see the camera, I got messed up.
[4377.75s -> 4379.75s]  Steve, go on the- you're driving
[4379.75s -> 4382.38s]  on the wrong side of the road, Steve.
[4382.38s -> 4384.38s]  Steve, you need to be on the right side of the road, otherwise
[4384.38s -> 4386.38s]  my fucked up plan is you're
[4386.38s -> 4388.38s]  stuck in the middle. Steve,
[4388.38s -> 4390.38s]  you're stuck in the middle of the road, Steve.
[4390.38s -> 4392.38s]  I don't think I can come get you.
[4392.38s -> 4394.38s]  Steve, you really blew this
[4394.38s -> 4396.38s]  whole thing. I can't come get you, Steve. You're going to have to call an Uber.
[4396.38s -> 4398.38s]  But when you get in that
[4398.38s -> 4400.38s]  Uber, you make sure to tell that Uber driver.
[4400.38s -> 4402.74s]  You tell him.
[4402.74s -> 4404.74s]  And he goes under 40 miles per hour.
[4404.74s -> 4406.74s]  You know what? Just, just
[4406.74s -> 4411.48s]  fuck this.
[4411.48s -> 4419.22s]  Actually, I am stuck. How many other cameras are there?
[4419.22s -> 4423.82s]  Top down?
[4423.82s -> 4425.82s]  On board as a rider.
[4425.82s -> 4429.53s]  Hey, man,
[4429.53s -> 4432.09s]  really think you
[4432.09s -> 4434.09s]  missed the stop back there.
[4434.09s -> 4436.71s]  I was supposed to get off at Fourth
[4436.71s -> 4440.42s]  Street. Yeah,
[4440.42s -> 4442.66s]  probably
[4442.66s -> 4444.66s]  should probably slow down a little.
[4444.66s -> 4449.08s]  I think you're going a little too fast.
[4449.08s -> 4454.58s]  Watch out! Watch out! That's a red light!
[4454.58s -> 4458.73s]  Why are you not talking?
[4458.73s -> 4460.73s]  Fucking goddamn AI drivers.
[4460.73s -> 4463.91s]  Hello?
[4463.91s -> 4465.91s]  Call number. 1-800 number to call for tech support.
[4465.91s -> 4468.41s]  Fucking god damn it.
[4468.41s -> 4474.68s]  There's something wrong with this one.
[4474.68s -> 4479.93s]  What am I supposed to do? I can't get out of the car.
[4479.93s -> 4481.93s]  I knew this wasn't going to be ready for at least another 20
[4481.93s -> 4483.93s]  or 30 fucking years at least.
[4483.93s -> 4485.93s]  And I got on the bus this time. I'm the one that gets on the bus during
[4485.93s -> 4488.62s]  the AI shit.
[4488.62s -> 4491.30s]  I mean, it's going.
[4491.30s -> 4493.30s]  I wonder where it's going. What is in the GPS?
[4493.30s -> 4498.98s]  I have no idea.
[4498.98s -> 4500.98s]  I will never work.
[4500.98s -> 4507.32s]  I will never
[4507.32s -> 4509.32s]  work. This thing will accidentally
[4509.32s -> 4511.32s]  get put into a Wendy's, right?
[4511.32s -> 4513.32s]  It's like, oh, OK, time to go to the Wendy's.
[4513.32s -> 4515.32s]  It's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[4515.32s -> 4517.32s]  For some reason, like the Wendy's will just go in the GPS.
[4517.32s -> 4530.38s]  It's like, I didn't want to go to Wendy's. I'm supposed to go home.
[4530.38s -> 4534.66s]  I'm trying to go home.
[4534.66s -> 4540.10s]  And see, the AI didn't
[4540.10s -> 4542.10s]  know that this is a new road.
[4542.10s -> 4544.10s]  It didn't know the road split right there.
[4544.10s -> 4546.10s]  It thought the road went straight. So it doesn't
[4546.10s -> 4548.10s]  updated the firmware. I don't want any firmware
[4548.10s -> 4552.78s]  updates it's going to fucking take.
[4552.78s -> 4554.78s]  This car is crushed up, man.
[4554.78s -> 4559.96s]  It's crumpled.
[4559.96s -> 4561.96s]  I'm going. I don't.
[4561.96s -> 4563.96s]  I can't really see. I don't know.
[4563.96s -> 4567.16s]  Oh, hey, I was gone.
[4567.16s -> 4578.41s]  I'm back. Put rockets on the bus.
[4578.41s -> 4580.41s]  I mean, the back of the bus is fine. The front of the bus
[4580.41s -> 4584.95s]  is kind of fucked up. I can't turn.
[4584.95s -> 4588.98s]  Oh, boy.
[4588.98s -> 4593.59s]  Oh, boy.
[4593.59s -> 4595.59s]  I'm serious. Right now?
[4595.59s -> 4597.59s]  Right now? I am.
[4597.59s -> 4599.59s]  I'm jumping out of the car. You know what I mean? Like if this is like
[4599.59s -> 4601.59s]  AI, just like the GPS got
[4601.59s -> 4603.59s]  fucked up and it just doesn't know what it's doing.
[4603.59s -> 4605.59s]  I'm going out this window right now. I'm just diving out.
[4605.59s -> 4612.70s]  I'm getting out of the car. Spawn police?
[4612.70s -> 4616.15s]  Hold on.
[4616.15s -> 4628.76s]  Spawn police?
[4628.76s -> 4632.58s]  No, get that off. Okay.
[4632.58s -> 4638.07s]  How do I do it? Unstop.
[4638.07s -> 4641.13s]  Fire, brake, extinguish,
[4641.13s -> 4645.03s]  hinges. Where is it?
[4645.03s -> 4649.37s]  Oh, AI. Random AI.
[4649.37s -> 4652.44s]  Chase me. The AI is going to
[4652.44s -> 4657.05s]  chase you? What? Who are?
[4657.05s -> 4698.82s]  Oh my god!
[4710.54s -> 4712.54s]  Each one of these people has been paid
[4712.54s -> 4714.54s]  $15,000 to crash
[4714.54s -> 4716.54s]  into your identity.
[4716.54s -> 4718.54s]  Your identity.
[4718.54s -> 4720.54s]  It's your job. Your choice.
[4720.54s -> 4722.54s]  See how long you can live.
[4722.54s -> 4724.54s]  All of these people that have been paid $20,000
[4724.54s -> 4726.54s]  to crash into your identity.
[4726.54s -> 4728.54s]  Hold on. Hold on.
[4728.54s -> 4730.54s]  Everybody freeze.
[4730.54s -> 4732.54s]  Freeze. Freeze.
[4732.54s -> 4736.25s]  Freeze. Different idea.
[4736.25s -> 4740.79s]  Freeze. Freeze. Everybody freeze.
[4740.79s -> 4748.60s]  Hold on. Hold on. You found yourself
[4748.60s -> 4750.60s]  standing in this car, wondering why
[4750.60s -> 4753.74s]  you're here while you woke up here.
[4753.74s -> 4755.74s]  Understanding that you have access to the gas.
[4755.74s -> 4758.10s]  Gas. Gas.
[4758.10s -> 4763.16s]  Gas. Gas. Gas. Gas.
[4763.16s -> 4765.16s]  Driving this car is at your utmost
[4765.16s -> 4767.16s]  intended purpose.
[4767.16s -> 4769.46s]  Because every single car on this road,
[4769.46s -> 4771.46s]  David, is AI.
[4771.46s -> 4773.83s]  AI controlled cars
[4773.83s -> 4775.83s]  will have been programmed to kill you.
[4775.83s -> 4778.90s]  They will stop at nothing before
[4778.90s -> 4780.90s]  you are a corpse.
[4780.90s -> 4783.08s]  You ought to make your choice and
[4783.08s -> 4785.08s]  drive around and get away from these
[4785.08s -> 4787.08s]  AI gas
[4787.08s -> 4791.11s]  controlled cars.
[4791.11s -> 4793.29s]  Good luck. You're going to need it.
[4793.29s -> 4797.13s]  As you see, my thing, this is
[4797.13s -> 4799.13s]  technology is getting a little too crazy.
[4799.13s -> 4801.13s]  You were the one that programmed
[4801.13s -> 4803.13s]  these cars, aren't you David?
[4803.13s -> 4805.13s]  You were the one that programmed these cars.
[4805.13s -> 4807.13s]  You are
[4807.13s -> 4811.48s]  completely stuck.
[4811.48s -> 4813.48s]  Technology can't solve every problem,
[4813.48s -> 4815.48s]  David. As I'm sure you're realizing right now.
[4815.48s -> 4826.17s]  Alright, no more Saw.
[4826.17s -> 4839.35s]  I'm done with Saw.
[4839.35s -> 4841.35s]  You were the programmer of these.
[4841.35s -> 4843.35s]  You were the CEO of the programming, weren't you David?
[4843.35s -> 4853.58s]  Alright, I want to...
[4853.58s -> 4855.94s]  He's actually backing up.
[4855.94s -> 4866.74s]  What happened?
[4866.74s -> 4872.42s]  Instability detected?
[4872.42s -> 4875.43s]  What do you mean instability?
[4875.43s -> 4888.92s]  Where? On the bus?
[4888.92s -> 4899.72s]  What the fuck?
[4899.72s -> 4910.39s]  What is this?
[4910.39s -> 4917.69s]  Why is this attached to the car?
[4917.69s -> 4926.46s]  It's your tire?
[4926.46s -> 4930.17s]  What's going on? What is it attached to?
[4930.17s -> 4937.78s]  I don't get it. It's on the moon.
[4937.78s -> 4956.84s]  How do I get rid of it? How do I take that off?
[4956.84s -> 4959.27s]  Alright, I'm going to a new map.
[4959.27s -> 4970.60s]  Pause, pause, pause. What is this person doing?
[4970.60s -> 4983.46s]  How do I go faster? What are they doing?
[4983.46s -> 4989.67s]  Why are people just driving into stuff?
[4989.67s -> 4995.94s]  Alright, we're going to grid map.
[4995.94s -> 4999.91s]  I'm changing map.
[4999.91s -> 5007.08s]  Grid map, people are saying.
[5007.08s -> 5009.08s]  Compete in the west coast drag race?
[5009.08s -> 5012.90s]  I want to do this. Oh no, I don't. It's the same map.
[5012.90s -> 5021.08s]  Main menu? Okay, where do you want to go?
[5021.08s -> 5025.43s]  Grid? Grid.
[5025.43s -> 5029.34s]  Grid map V2.
[5029.34s -> 5032.54s]  Leave me the fuck alone.
[5032.54s -> 5034.54s]  Is this the default?
[5034.54s -> 5038.50s]  Oh my god, what's happening?
[5038.50s -> 5040.50s]  Oh, that's right. They're on missions to kill me.
[5040.50s -> 5057.90s]  I'm going to go default.
[5061.90s -> 5068.23s]  Is this where the giant enemy spider is?
[5068.23s -> 5072.58s]  That's a different game. This is interesting though.
[5072.58s -> 5080.38s]  I want a different car.
[5080.38s -> 5083.96s]  I want...oh, is this the environment stuff?
[5083.96s -> 5088.17s]  What should I drive? Probably something cool, right?
[5088.17s -> 5099.80s]  You can drive the cannon.
[5099.80s -> 5105.35s]  Drive the pigeon. Okay.
[5105.35s -> 5112.78s]  How about the pigeon plus?
[5112.78s -> 5115.78s]  So this is a little obstacle course.
[5115.78s -> 5130.81s]  This looks like a Disney car.
[5130.81s -> 5135.42s]  Whoa, that's cool. That was awesome.
[5135.42s -> 5139.18s]  Alright, I'm going to do it again.
[5139.18s -> 5141.18s]  This car has three wheels. What is this for?
[5141.18s -> 5149.99s]  It's a three wheeled one.
[5149.99s -> 5154.58s]  Whoa, hold on.
[5154.58s -> 5166.30s]  Can I squish through that? Is it insert to repair?
[5166.30s -> 5171.93s]  Let's find out.
[5171.93s -> 5175.06s]  I like this little course. Insert.
[5175.06s -> 5181.13s]  Thanks for that tip.
[5181.13s -> 5185.03s]  Alright, where am I going to go? I want to go...
[5185.03s -> 5187.03s]  Let me set my home here so I don't keep spawning in a place I don't want to spawn.
[5187.03s -> 5189.03s]  What? AI?
[5189.03s -> 5191.03s]  I don't want traffic here, do I?
[5191.03s -> 5195.64s]  What's powertrain?
[5195.64s -> 5199.66s]  Manage. Set home.
[5199.66s -> 5203.82s]  You picked the wrong pigeon.
[5203.82s -> 5205.82s]  Alright, I'll pick the...whatever. Let's go.
[5205.82s -> 5209.08s]  You want me to pick a different pigeon?
[5209.08s -> 5217.26s]  You want this one. This one here.
[5217.26s -> 5219.26s]  What kind of car is this?
[5219.26s -> 5222.18s]  Alright, this thing is not supposed to be driven.
[5222.18s -> 5229.22s]  You don't drive this car.
[5229.22s -> 5231.22s]  This car is meant to just...
[5231.22s -> 5237.75s]  Is this a real car?
[5237.75s -> 5241.59s]  Are you serious? Look what I just did.
[5241.59s -> 5245.62s]  It's training wheels.
[5245.62s -> 5248.44s]  I feel like I want to be driving the other direction.
[5248.44s -> 5252.28s]  Alright, I want to take two cars
[5252.28s -> 5254.28s]  and have them drive as fast as they can and smash into each other.
[5254.28s -> 5256.65s]  I can do that, right?
[5256.65s -> 5258.65s]  I'm going to start at the one end of the track
[5258.65s -> 5260.65s]  and I'm going to go a thousand miles per hour
[5260.65s -> 5262.65s]  and then I'm going to crash into each other.
[5262.65s -> 5275.82s]  That's what I want to do.
[5275.82s -> 5278.18s]  Oh, man. Ow.
[5278.18s -> 5280.18s]  Okay. Manage.
[5280.18s -> 5282.18s]  Select. I want a very fast car.
[5282.18s -> 5287.11s]  I'll vote one of these.
[5287.11s -> 5290.36s]  Yeah. This one.
[5290.36s -> 5293.75s]  And do slow-mo, slow-mo, slow-mo.
[5293.75s -> 5297.21s]  I'll do slow-mo.
[5297.21s -> 5300.60s]  Okay, we're going to get you here.
[5300.60s -> 5302.60s]  So I need to spawn another car.
[5302.60s -> 5307.21s]  Where's that one? That one's here.
[5307.21s -> 5310.02s]  That's fine. So now over this way, I want to spawn another car.
[5310.02s -> 5312.33s]  Very far away.
[5312.33s -> 5317.96s]  Like all the way over here.
[5317.96s -> 5323.08s]  I can spawn a car right here, can't I?
[5323.08s -> 5331.27s]  Same deal. I just want to see what happens.
[5331.27s -> 5334.78s]  So, spawn new.
[5334.78s -> 5336.95s]  Okay. So now,
[5336.95s -> 5342.57s]  use the grid?
[5342.57s -> 5344.57s]  What on the rocket? Use the grid.
[5344.57s -> 5346.57s]  What do you mean use the grid?
[5346.57s -> 5371.40s]  Oh, I went the wrong way.
[5371.40s -> 5379.58s]  No, no, no. Come back, come back, come back.
[5379.58s -> 5381.58s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[5381.58s -> 5383.58s]  What the fuck? Whatever.
[5383.58s -> 5385.58s]  I went the wrong way. It's hard.
[5385.58s -> 5391.72s]  Just get over here. Both of you.
[5391.72s -> 5397.48s]  Stay right there. Use the grid.
[5397.48s -> 5404.78s]  Use the grid on the ground. I don't get it.
[5404.78s -> 5409.58s]  Use them to line up on the grid.
[5409.58s -> 5411.58s]  Oh, I thought you meant it was like a thing,
[5411.58s -> 5413.58s]  like a menu thing I had to do and go into the grid.
[5413.58s -> 5415.58s]  Hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[5415.58s -> 5433.42s]  Nice. Okay.
[5433.42s -> 5438.47s]  We're going to line up here.
[5438.47s -> 5440.47s]  Right in the middle here. That looks good.
[5440.47s -> 5444.31s]  Switch to the yellow one. Where the hell are you?
[5444.31s -> 5454.86s]  Where are you? Where's the other car? Where's the other car?
[5454.86s -> 5465.21s]  Where's the other car? Use the AI
[5465.21s -> 5467.21s]  chase? No, I want to smash them into each other.
[5467.21s -> 5477.64s]  Where's the other car? Where the fuck is the other car?
[5477.64s -> 5485.32s]  Okay, there you are.
[5485.32s -> 5487.69s]  Alright, alright, alright, alright. So you need to line up.
[5487.69s -> 5495.11s]  You're fine, but you need to come over here.
[5495.11s -> 5498.89s]  Use the chase and go head on. Wait.
[5498.89s -> 5504.39s]  Okay. Let me try that.
[5504.39s -> 5518.90s]  That will work. What menu is it in?
[5518.90s -> 5521.40s]  AI, okay. AI, chase me.
[5521.40s -> 5553.24s]  Alright, where are you?
[5553.24s -> 5564.70s]  AI. He crashed.
[5564.70s -> 5598.34s]  Is he crashed? Stop avoiding
[5598.34s -> 5600.34s]  me. What the fuck? What
[5600.34s -> 5604.44s]  the... Stop avoiding...
[5604.44s -> 5612.25s]  He avoided me.
[5612.25s -> 5621.02s]  You just...
[5627.02s -> 5638.20s]  Stop. Stop it.
[5638.20s -> 5645.16s]  Stop. Get off of me. Get away from
[5645.16s -> 5664.86s]  me. Get off of me.
[5664.86s -> 5672.09s]  He's...
[5672.09s -> 5675.48s]  Fuck. I have an idea.
[5675.48s -> 5677.48s]  Okay, I want to run away from like 20
[5677.48s -> 5681.18s]  Mack trucks. Can I... Wait.
[5681.18s -> 5683.18s]  Can I just have like 10 Mack trucks just drive
[5683.18s -> 5692.71s]  straight into each other? That sounds kind of cool.
[5692.71s -> 5695.85s]  Alright, one more of these and I'm done.
[5695.85s -> 5707.24s]  What's wrong with you? Why are you not chasing anymore?
[5707.24s -> 5711.08s]  Come on. I'm leaving this guy in the dust.
[5711.08s -> 5721.50s]  Where is he? Oh my god.
[5721.50s -> 5763.72s]  Did you repair the other car? I think so.
[5763.72s -> 5784.39s]  Is this a wall? Is he alright?
[5784.39s -> 5787.14s]  The guy gets out of the car and he like
[5787.14s -> 5789.96s]  with the red bull. He did it!
[5789.96s -> 5791.96s]  Oh my god, he actually did it! He made it!
[5791.96s -> 5794.14s]  He made... He did the jump!
[5794.14s -> 5804.42s]  Where's the other car? Oh no.
[5804.42s -> 5822.84s]  Alright, how do I delete cars?
[5822.84s -> 5834.79s]  Is he coming for me? This is going to be scary.
[5834.79s -> 5852.78s]  Wait, there he is.
[5852.78s -> 5854.78s]  Jeez. What's up, man?
[5854.78s -> 5859.88s]  Alright, let me... Okay.
[5859.88s -> 5862.12s]  Alright, alright. Let me do this here. I want to
[5862.12s -> 5864.36s]  do... I want to delete everybody. Delete
[5864.36s -> 5866.86s]  everybody. Delete car. How do you delete car?
[5866.86s -> 5874.66s]  Manage. Remove, right?
[5874.66s -> 5881.35s]  Okay, remove. And then remove.
[5881.35s -> 5883.35s]  Okay, I want a bunch of trucks.
[5883.35s -> 5891.27s]  Okay, so. Manage.
[5891.27s -> 5896.01s]  Okay, what's something crazy? Okay, buses?
[5896.01s -> 5902.07s]  The Ram bus? The hero?
[5902.07s -> 5904.76s]  Which one of these should I do? The hero bus?
[5904.76s -> 5908.47s]  Okay, can I spawn this
[5908.47s -> 5911.16s]  a bunch of times? Or do I have to do the menu
[5911.16s -> 5923.32s]  every time? Just do clone? Okay, cool.
[5923.32s -> 5926.07s]  Alright, so now I want to do clone.
[5926.07s -> 5936.22s]  Clone. Clone. Is it going to
[5936.22s -> 5943.26s]  break my computer? Is it going to be bad for the computer?
[5943.26s -> 5956.18s]  Hope so. Yeah, I hope
[5956.18s -> 5959.70s]  so. Alright, what do you think? 20?
[5959.70s -> 5962.20s]  One, two, three, four, five, six,
[5962.20s -> 5964.20s]  seven, eight, nine. Let's do like 20.
[5964.20s -> 5970.73s]  And we're going to have them all on chase mode.
[5970.73s -> 5979.93s]  Is that a bad idea? Oh, well
[5979.93s -> 5990.66s]  here's 10. I'll try 10. Okay.
[5990.66s -> 5997.37s]  Uh, select.
[5997.37s -> 6000.89s]  Looks like a little dinky car. Don't do
[6000.89s -> 6006.90s]  20. My CPU's going to explode. Fridge?
[6006.90s -> 6016.10s]  Huh? Can I move
[6016.10s -> 6021.93s]  as the fridge? I can't, okay,
[6021.93s -> 6027.69s]  I can't move as the fridge. Whatever. Okay,
[6027.69s -> 6035.43s]  select. How about um, pause
[6035.43s -> 6039.72s]  before you start? It's the best vehicle?
[6039.72s -> 6042.84s]  Get in the ball. Um,
[6042.84s -> 6046.62s]  for now, I want to, I'm going to just get into one of these.
[6046.62s -> 6051.78s]  Get in the tanker. Should I
[6051.78s -> 6053.78s]  do a Christmas tree? No, alright, I'll do the ball.
[6053.78s -> 6061.96s]  Can I move? I can't really move.
[6061.96s -> 6068.34s]  Doesn't really work the way you think it is. I'm just going to
[6068.34s -> 6079.78s]  get in a car. Okay, here we go. So these are all,
[6079.78s -> 6107.18s]  I'm going to set these all to kill. It's kind of lagging.
[6107.18s -> 6111.00s]  Okay, chase me.
[6111.00s -> 6126.92s]  Chase me. Why are they one
[6126.92s -> 6128.92s]  singular bus?
[6128.92s -> 6131.16s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[6131.16s -> 6134.04s]  Why are they one bus?
[6134.04s -> 6150.66s]  What the fuck?
[6150.66s -> 6152.66s]  Oh, oh! What do I do?
[6152.66s -> 6164.94s]  Reset.
[6164.94s -> 6171.27s]  That was a tactical movement.
[6171.27s -> 6173.27s]  Fuck this stupid goddamn sports car.
[6175.27s -> 6177.27s]  You went a little too fast. Oh my god.
[6177.27s -> 6179.27s]  Raise it ten, raise it ten feet off the ground.
[6179.27s -> 6181.27s]  Make the tires bigger. Give me
[6181.27s -> 6184.66s]  another car. These things suck.
[6184.66s -> 6186.66s]  Gigantic fucking toy.
[6186.66s -> 6188.66s]  I want something I can drive, like this.
[6188.66s -> 6193.45s]  Yeah! That's much better.
[6193.45s -> 6202.34s]  This is a man sized car.
[6202.34s -> 6207.02s]  Alright, so this is all fucked up.
[6207.02s -> 6209.32s]  I don't think this is going to happen anymore.
[6209.32s -> 6215.08s]  Do I just like, alright, there is a
[6215.08s -> 6217.08s]  bump stuck in this car.
[6217.08s -> 6224.49s]  Which one of these should, I want to drive
[6224.49s -> 6229.67s]  one of the other cars.
[6229.67s -> 6232.23s]  Tab. Tab. How do I switch cars?
[6232.23s -> 6234.23s]  Shift R.
[6234.23s -> 6238.26s]  R.
[6238.26s -> 6241.34s]  This is actually fucked up.
[6241.34s -> 6248.74s]  Hit insert.
[6248.74s -> 6250.74s]  Alright, this is the one causing the problem.
[6250.74s -> 6257.08s]  I gotta back this one up. I feel like I'm playing
[6257.08s -> 6259.08s]  one of those iPad games where I have to go
[6259.08s -> 6261.08s]  slide down, slide left, slide left,
[6261.08s -> 6263.08s]  right, right, slide down, slide down.
[6263.08s -> 6290.65s]  Okay.
[6290.65s -> 6292.65s]  Oh my god! Why are they all so connected
[6292.65s -> 6295.53s]  to each other?
[6295.53s -> 6297.53s]  It's like a campaign trail.
[6297.53s -> 6309.69s]  Where are we going?
[6309.69s -> 6313.46s]  I don't know where to go.
[6313.46s -> 6320.55s]  There's too many.
[6320.55s -> 6323.11s]  Their weakness is turning.
[6323.11s -> 6335.40s]  Holy shit, they're going fast.
[6335.40s -> 6337.40s]  Nobody gives a senator the finger out the window.
[6337.40s -> 6344.50s]  Get him!
[6344.50s -> 6346.50s]  Some of them are going to lose, some of them I think.
[6346.50s -> 6349.64s]  No, he's still there.
[6349.64s -> 6353.86s]  Uh oh.
[6353.86s -> 6355.86s]  The brakes.
[6355.86s -> 6358.23s]  Oh shit.
[6358.23s -> 6361.62s]  Oh my god!
[6361.62s -> 6367.24s]  I'm still...
[6367.24s -> 6384.57s]  Uh oh.
[6384.57s -> 6386.57s]  I want to take this to
[6386.57s -> 6388.57s]  somewhere else, right?
[6388.57s -> 6392.22s]  Yeah, I want to go somewhere else.
[6392.22s -> 6397.66s]  I want to go to one of the other places.
[6397.66s -> 6401.37s]  Let's go back to the main.
[6401.37s -> 6405.59s]  Bus routes? Italy?
[6405.59s -> 6407.90s]  Where else should I go?
[6407.90s -> 6410.58s]  The Derby Arena?
[6410.58s -> 6414.94s]  Oh, the Derby Arena.
[6414.94s -> 6421.34s]  Go to scenarios. Collect mountain.
[6421.34s -> 6423.34s]  Garage to garage delivery. Port escape.
[6423.34s -> 6425.34s]  King size.
[6425.34s -> 6427.64s]  Goliath. Alright, what's Goliath?
[6427.64s -> 6429.64s]  A semi truck is causing havoc on the highway.
[6429.64s -> 6431.64s]  We must stop it at all costs.
[6431.64s -> 6433.64s]  That won't be easy, but you don't have to worry about damaging your vehicle.
[6433.64s -> 6443.82s]  Alright?
[6443.82s -> 6448.10s]  Where's the music? Is there music?
[6448.10s -> 6454.17s]  Is it on?
[6454.17s -> 6463.38s]  This one is really hard.
[6463.38s -> 6466.25s]  The semi truck is causing havoc on the highway.
[6466.25s -> 6468.25s]  We must stop it at all costs.
[6468.25s -> 6471.19s]  Won't be easy, but you don't have to worry.
[6471.19s -> 6477.40s]  So stop the truck. Where is it?
[6477.40s -> 6483.22s]  Causing havoc on the highway.
[6483.22s -> 6485.66s]  Put on brake core for this.
[6485.66s -> 6503.11s]  Okay, you ready?
[6503.11s -> 6510.52s]  You ready?
[6510.52s -> 6512.52s]  It's, uh, okay, this one. Let's go!
[6512.52s -> 6528.14s]  Restart. Restart the mission.
[6528.14s -> 6530.14s]  Restart the mission.
[6530.14s -> 6532.14s]  This is fucking with my head.
[6532.14s -> 6534.14s]  This is fucking with my head. Imagine if the police were listening to this.
[6534.14s -> 6537.59s]  Yeah, John, let's go!
[6537.59s -> 6539.59s]  Turn it up!
[6539.59s -> 6550.41s]  We gotta chase!
[6550.41s -> 6567.18s]  Oh my fucking god, that's fine.
[6567.18s -> 6569.18s]  I can't fucking do it.
[6569.18s -> 6571.18s]  Just drive the car. I can't.
[6571.18s -> 6573.18s]  I'm trying.
[6573.18s -> 6575.18s]  I tried!
[6575.18s -> 6578.31s]  Alright, where is this motherfucker?
[6578.31s -> 6580.68s]  Get him!
[6580.68s -> 6584.65s]  Dude, it sounds like the person in the passenger seat
[6584.65s -> 6586.65s]  is just going like this to the
[6586.65s -> 6588.65s]  tuner. It's like, dude,
[6588.65s -> 6590.65s]  pick a station! We're trying to
[6590.65s -> 6595.96s]  catch this guy!
[6595.96s -> 6604.34s]  There he is! I can't see!
[6604.34s -> 6608.89s]  Where is he?
[6608.89s -> 6614.58s]  Okay, alright.
[6614.58s -> 6616.58s]  Alright, alright, alright. Give me a second.
[6616.58s -> 6618.58s]  Give me a second. Give me a second.
[6618.58s -> 6620.58s]  Regular camera. Let me try regular.
[6620.58s -> 6638.74s]  Regular camera.
[6638.74s -> 6644.38s]  Alright, there he is right there.
[6644.38s -> 6650.97s]  What the fuck? I want the siren!
[6650.97s -> 6668.38s]  How do I turn the siren on?
[6668.38s -> 6684.50s]  I'm sorry.
[6684.50s -> 6686.50s]  I'm trying to wait on stuff.
[6686.50s -> 6689.64s]  Just get in the road!
[6689.64s -> 6713.62s]  Hold on.
[6713.62s -> 6718.74s]  I can't.
[6718.74s -> 6724.42s]  I can't.
[6724.42s -> 6726.42s]  It's too fucked up!
[6726.42s -> 6730.01s]  It's too fucked up. I'm sorry.
[6730.01s -> 6732.01s]  I can't help it. I have to do something fucking stupid.
[6732.01s -> 6734.18s]  Just restart.
[6734.18s -> 6736.18s]  Alright, I promise I'm not going to turn on
[6736.18s -> 6738.18s]  the brake core.
[6738.18s -> 6742.78s]  It's funny.
[6742.78s -> 6744.78s]  You can keep the music, but keep the
[6744.78s -> 6753.54s]  regular camera. Okay, fine.
[6753.54s -> 6755.54s]  How about this camera? This one's good.
[6755.54s -> 6760.34s]  Arnold?
[6760.34s -> 6779.67s]  Hey! Pull over!
[6779.67s -> 6781.85s]  Pull over!
[6781.85s -> 6785.62s]  Did you just hear this out of the officer's car?
[6799.26s -> 6803.21s]  Stop!
[6803.21s -> 6805.21s]  Stop driving! Stop moving!
[6805.21s -> 6811.80s]  Stop!
[6811.80s -> 6813.80s]  Oh my god, you piece of shit!
[6813.80s -> 6816.17s]  Just crash!
[6816.17s -> 6837.80s]  No, not me!
[6837.80s -> 6839.80s]  God damn it!
[6839.80s -> 6841.80s]  Fuck!
[6841.80s -> 6852.36s]  I'm doing it again.
[6852.36s -> 6857.16s]  No, I have a better idea.
[6857.16s -> 6862.22s]  I'm not doing fucking crazy music.
[6862.22s -> 6935.22s]  I'm catching this guy.
[6935.22s -> 6937.22s]  Right into it!
[6937.22s -> 6946.06s]  Stop driving!
[6946.06s -> 6988.34s]  Is he going to run out of gas?
[6988.34s -> 6995.83s]  What was that?
[6995.83s -> 7001.02s]  Why is he speeding up?
[7001.02s -> 7004.86s]  Why is he speeding up? I can't see.
[7004.86s -> 7009.59s]  No, he's not speeding up.
[7009.59s -> 7012.34s]  I don't understand what I'm supposed to do about this.
[7012.34s -> 7021.24s]  I actually don't understand what to do.
[7021.24s -> 7027.64s]  You piece of shit!
[7027.64s -> 7037.11s]  I've got to get him to drive into one of those poles.
[7037.11s -> 7039.93s]  There it is!
[7039.93s -> 7043.64s]  Three, two, one.
[7043.64s -> 7045.64s]  Got it.
[7045.64s -> 7050.04s]  Bang. Got it.
[7050.04s -> 7053.99s]  Hell yeah. Nice.
[7053.99s -> 7060.63s]  Alright, what else should I do? That was cool.
[7060.63s -> 7062.63s]  Uh...
[7062.63s -> 7065.77s]  Barrel? Barrel knocker?
[7065.77s -> 7071.40s]  Yeah, let's do barrel knocker.
[7071.40s -> 7075.24s]  This game's cool. This game's actually really cool.
[7075.24s -> 7082.22s]  Do port escape. I'll do port escape after this.
[7082.22s -> 7088.74s]  He loves it. I think it's pretty good.
[7088.74s -> 7091.82s]  Just fun kind of sandbox.
[7091.82s -> 7095.81s]  Alright, I've done put some barrels around the dirt road.
[7095.81s -> 7099.05s]  This darn truck can't carry a tune in a bucket.
[7099.05s -> 7104.05s]  So pull up your britches and get fixin' to knock them all barrel down.
[7104.05s -> 7106.05s]  I reckon you got a minute or so.
[7106.05s -> 7110.05s]  Why you don't get all tore up? Them nasty barrels is hidin' in the swamp.
[7110.05s -> 7113.05s]  And them gosh darn bushes. I'm not gonna get the role.
[7113.05s -> 7117.42s]  I'm not gonna. I'm reading sides right now for this character and I'm not gonna get it.
[7117.42s -> 7122.46s]  Um, okay.
[7122.46s -> 7124.46s]  Uh, like country music?
[7124.46s -> 7130.52s]  Gotta have music in the background.
[7130.52s -> 7133.52s]  Like banjo music. Like banjo royalty free.
[7133.52s -> 7144.58s]  This is good. I think this works.
[7144.58s -> 7155.89s]  Knock over the barrels.
[7155.89s -> 7157.89s]  This is loud as fuck. Hold on.
[7157.89s -> 7172.85s]  There's no music.
[7172.85s -> 7174.85s]  Let's go. I missed it already.
[7174.85s -> 7179.90s]  Alright, let's go. Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[7179.90s -> 7184.96s]  Music's too quiet? There you go.
[7184.96s -> 7189.10s]  Music's up. Alright, restart.
[7189.10s -> 7205.87s]  Ready? One, two, three, go.
[7205.87s -> 7209.37s]  This is hard. This is way too hard.
[7209.37s -> 7212.31s]  This one's like fuckin' hard. Way hard.
[7212.31s -> 7214.31s]  This one's too hard. This one's way too hard.
[7214.31s -> 7216.31s]  Give us a good yee-haw.
[7221.61s -> 7223.61s]  How do you do yee-haw? It's like...
[7223.61s -> 7225.61s]  No, how do you do a yee-haw?
[7225.61s -> 7227.61s]  It's like...
[7227.61s -> 7231.00s]  You need to put this on times two speed.
[7231.00s -> 7233.24s]  You guys need to just...
[7233.24s -> 7248.02s]  Relax.
[7248.02s -> 7250.02s]  You guys just want breakcore.
[7250.02s -> 7252.02s]  You guys can't pay attention unless it's like...
[7252.02s -> 7254.02s]  Like...
[7254.02s -> 7256.02s]  No!
[7256.02s -> 7258.02s]  This is bad for your brain.
[7258.02s -> 7260.02s]  This is bad for your brain.
[7260.02s -> 7262.02s]  It's not good for your brain. You need to slow down.
[7262.02s -> 7264.02s]  You need to read a book. You need to fucking breathe oxygen.
[7264.02s -> 7266.02s]  Like, lie down. Lie in bed.
[7266.02s -> 7268.02s]  Don't listen to this.
[7268.02s -> 7270.02s]  It's small doses.
[7270.02s -> 7272.02s]  This is gonna hurt your brain cells. They're gonna fry.
[7272.02s -> 7279.69s]  It's over.
[7279.69s -> 7286.14s]  Now I miss it. Don't you?
[7286.14s -> 7288.14s]  I don't know. No, no, no.
[7288.14s -> 7290.14s]  I decide what to add to get on the stream.
[7290.14s -> 7295.77s]  I can't do this.
[7295.77s -> 7298.33s]  Please do breakcore.
[7298.33s -> 7303.83s]  I'm begging you to.
[7303.83s -> 7330.57s]  Alright, hold on. Slow down.
[7330.57s -> 7333.58s]  Yee-haw!
[7333.58s -> 7337.16s]  I was very unsure of that.
[7337.16s -> 7340.30s]  I was incredibly unsure of that.
[7340.30s -> 7344.90s]  Was it weak?
[7344.90s -> 7350.66s]  I was really unsure.
[7350.66s -> 7352.66s]  Yeah, all you guys need in the background here is...
[7352.66s -> 7355.10s]  I'm Detective Chocobo.
[7366.49s -> 7368.49s]  I'm telling ya. One, two, three.
[7368.49s -> 7376.74s]  Just play music and movie clips.
[7376.74s -> 7378.74s]  Alright, I'm not doing this one.
[7378.74s -> 7390.97s]  I'll try it one more time.
[7390.97s -> 7397.62s]  No, fuck that.
[7397.62s -> 7401.08s]  Let me try this for real.
[7401.08s -> 7405.37s]  Play the cars theme?
[7405.37s -> 7407.67s]  Do breakcore, slow down.
[7407.67s -> 7409.67s]  I wonder what that would sound like.
[7409.67s -> 7411.67s]  Don't get me wrong. I think that was cool.
[7411.67s -> 7413.67s]  Breakcore is outrageous.
[7413.67s -> 7415.67s]  Enough for me to be like, I'm paying attention.
[7415.67s -> 7417.91s]  This is interesting.
[7417.91s -> 7419.91s]  I don't know why I want to play that.
[7419.91s -> 7421.91s]  Unless I'm really looking for it.
[7421.91s -> 7424.86s]  It's cool.
[7424.86s -> 7426.86s]  I mean, that's really cool.
[7426.86s -> 7429.67s]  You missed one.
[7429.67s -> 7431.67s]  You corrected me on my own stream.
[7431.67s -> 7434.10s]  I'm alright.
[7434.10s -> 7437.75s]  Did you correct me?
[7437.75s -> 7440.57s]  What is this?
[7440.57s -> 7442.57s]  What does it hold on?
[7442.57s -> 7449.91s]  Cocoa for Cocoa Pops.
[7449.91s -> 7455.98s]  They're great.
[7460.60s -> 7463.99s]  Where did it go?
[7463.99s -> 7465.99s]  I'd buy that for a dollar.
[7465.99s -> 7468.94s]  That's a sufferin' sucka-tash.
[7471.75s -> 7478.46s]  Do you like it?
[7478.46s -> 7482.42s]  I'm going to play a video game.
[7482.42s -> 7484.42s]  Can I play a video game for like five minutes?
[7484.42s -> 7491.32s]  I'm not doing that one again.
[7491.32s -> 7498.42s]  Alright, port escape. We'll do this one.
[7498.42s -> 7504.89s]  Suscore.
[7507.06s -> 7509.06s]  Da da da.
[7509.06s -> 7511.06s]  Da da da.
[7511.06s -> 7521.62s]  Ba da da da da.
[7521.62s -> 7524.63s]  There's no time to explain.
[7524.63s -> 7526.63s]  You must leave the area as quick as possible.
[7526.63s -> 7545.38s]  Reach the ferry boat at the dock.
[7545.38s -> 7548.39s]  Not bad driving skills so far.
[7548.39s -> 7559.02s]  Not bad driving skills so far.
[7559.02s -> 7574.25s]  I'm stuck.
[7574.25s -> 7582.95s]  Dude, what the fuck?
[7582.95s -> 7603.10s]  Dude!
[7603.10s -> 7620.18s]  This one sucks. I'm really not even doing that bad.
[7620.18s -> 7624.26s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[7624.26s -> 7626.26s]  We're going to listen to this?
[7626.26s -> 7628.26s]  Oh my god.
[7628.26s -> 7630.26s]  Let's see how close I was to it.
[7630.26s -> 7636.01s]  Let's see how close I was.
[7636.01s -> 7638.01s]  Oh, this is times two.
[7638.01s -> 7641.21s]  Hold on.
[7641.21s -> 7643.21s]  I was fucking already-
[7653.03s -> 7665.19s]  I don't want to listen to this anymore.
[7665.19s -> 7667.19s]  Does anybody actually want to listen to this?
[7667.19s -> 7677.62s]  But I-
[7677.62s -> 7679.62s]  It's too much!
[7679.62s -> 7681.62s]  It's too many fucking sound effects.
[7681.62s -> 7684.25s]  It's too many.
[7684.25s -> 7701.66s]  Who is screaming?
[7701.66s -> 7704.86s]  Somebody is just going-
[7708.86s -> 7710.86s]  Who is screaming?
[7710.86s -> 7720.84s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[7720.84s -> 7725.45s]  Is it the game?
[7725.45s -> 7730.82s]  Oh, it's the game.
[7730.82s -> 7734.22s]  I just heard like-
[7734.22s -> 7736.22s]  I was like-
[7736.22s -> 7738.22s]  Who's fucking yelling?
[7738.22s -> 7740.22s]  I was like, this is terrifying.
[7740.22s -> 7744.57s]  I thought all the-
[7744.57s -> 7746.57s]  I thought it was somebody screaming.
[7746.57s -> 7749.94s]  Is it in the music?
[7751.94s -> 7753.94s]  No, it's not.
[7758.63s -> 7769.69s]  Listen.
[7769.69s -> 7771.69s]  It made it fucking so much worse.
[7771.69s -> 7780.46s]  Hold on.
[7792.79s -> 7794.79s]  Is it in it or is that the game?
[7794.79s -> 7819.56s]  It's both-
[7819.56s -> 7830.49s]  No, it's not?
[7830.49s -> 7839.94s]  What?
[7839.94s -> 7841.94s]  My brain is so confused right now.
[7841.94s -> 7843.94s]  I'm fucking confused.
[7843.94s -> 7848.81s]  Do you understand what I'm saying, right?
[7848.81s -> 7857.13s]  These are the same sound.
[7857.13s -> 7879.46s]  It's the same sound effect.
[7879.46s -> 7884.01s]  Did you hear the-
[7898.86s -> 7900.86s]  Okay, I'm done.
[7900.86s -> 7903.61s]  That was fun. That was fun.
[7903.61s -> 7905.61s]  There's the onion ring one too, apparently.
[7905.61s -> 7907.61s]  That was kind of good.
[7907.61s -> 7910.98s]  What's the onion ring one? It's a conspiracy.
[7910.98s -> 7914.76s]  Alright, what's the onion ring?
[7914.76s -> 7929.66s]  I haven't even done the mission, guys.
[7929.66s -> 7932.54s]  Alright, this is onion ring
[7932.54s -> 7934.54s]  German- onion ring German remix.
[7934.54s -> 7944.33s]  No screams.
[7944.33s -> 7969.93s]  I have to turn this off.
[7982.66s -> 7996.41s]  Dude.
[7996.41s -> 7998.41s]  They're a little gross.
[7998.41s -> 8002.12s]  But they're pretty good.
[8002.12s -> 8004.12s]  Kind of weird, but it's not that bad.
[8004.12s -> 8006.12s]  Um, no.
[8006.12s -> 8008.12s]  I already hate it. I already hate it.
[8008.12s -> 8010.12s]  It's okay.
[8010.12s -> 8012.12s]  Final review.
[8012.12s -> 8014.81s]  It's just weird listening to myself talk.
[8014.81s -> 8017.62s]  6.4. Yeah, 6.4.
[8017.62s -> 8046.73s]  How are you supposed
[8046.73s -> 8060.74s]  to do that shit?
[8060.74s -> 8062.74s]  This is it. This is it. This is it. This is it.
[8062.74s -> 8067.10s]  This is it.
[8067.10s -> 8091.54s]  This is it. This is it. Here it comes.
[8091.54s -> 8097.24s]  Octave. I can't control
[8097.24s -> 8101.14s]  the car. The car
[8101.14s -> 8112.92s]  stalled out.
[8112.92s -> 8114.92s]  I can't listen to this anymore.
[8114.92s -> 8117.22s]  That was awesome.
[8117.22s -> 8119.66s]  But I need to beat this level. Right now.
[8119.66s -> 8121.83s]  I need to beat this level right now.
[8121.83s -> 8129.64s]  Before I freak out.
[8129.64s -> 8131.64s]  I feel like I had donation songs on, right?
[8131.64s -> 8134.39s]  That was actually really good.
[8134.39s -> 8143.21s]  There's another one?
[8143.21s -> 8147.43s]  Germapenis music. What is germapenis music?
[8147.43s -> 8166.04s]  Have I heard this one?
[8166.04s -> 8169.56s]  Is this what I'm going to be remembered?
[8169.56s -> 8172.18s]  I don't have a funeral or whatever.
[8172.18s -> 8174.18s]  I guess people are going to think back like
[8174.18s -> 8176.18s]  is this guy, this fucking
[8176.18s -> 8180.60s]  weird guy? What's my legacy?
[8180.60s -> 8184.82s]  Do I have one? Are you guys going to
[8184.82s -> 8186.82s]  okay, 10, 20
[8186.82s -> 8189.32s]  plus years from now, are you guys going to open
[8189.32s -> 8191.32s]  up germapenis music and be nostalgic?
[8191.32s -> 8193.32s]  And go, oh!
[8193.32s -> 8195.32s]  Germapenis music!
[8195.32s -> 8197.32s]  I remember that!
[8197.32s -> 8206.52s]  Yeah!
[8206.52s -> 8209.59s]  I guess I was younger. I thought it was
[8209.59s -> 8212.22s]  funny I guess. I don't know.
[8212.22s -> 8215.80s]  Maybe I was young?
[8215.80s -> 8218.87s]  Let me give it one more chance.
[8218.87s -> 8229.43s]  I wonder what
[8229.43s -> 8231.43s]  that's weird. I wonder what people are going to say.
[8231.43s -> 8235.34s]  Germapenis is
[8235.34s -> 8237.64s]  Surma.
[8237.64s -> 8240.33s]  Surma.
[8240.33s -> 8242.33s]  This is depressing.
[8242.33s -> 8244.33s]  It's not depressing. It's just funny.
[8244.33s -> 8246.95s]  I'm just thinking of, I've gone
[8246.95s -> 8248.95s]  back and watched Jim Carrey movies.
[8248.95s -> 8250.95s]  Oh, The Mask, like Smokin!
[8250.95s -> 8252.95s]  And I'm thinking of people going back and watching
[8252.95s -> 8257.88s]  something like this.
[8257.88s -> 8261.85s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[8261.85s -> 8266.07s]  You're going like that!
[8266.07s -> 8280.86s]  That's what I'd be doing. See that shit?
[8280.86s -> 8283.99s]  That's the fucking dance to this song.
[8283.99s -> 8286.87s]  Can you fucking trick that in?
[8286.87s -> 8309.13s]  Don't remember that.
[8309.13s -> 8311.13s]  I don't want you to remember that.
[8311.13s -> 8313.37s]  I want you to remember something else.
[8313.37s -> 8315.37s]  Don't remember that part of the stream.
[8315.37s -> 8317.37s]  I'm so winded.
[8317.37s -> 8323.19s]  Holy shit, I'm fucking
[8323.19s -> 8325.19s]  winded like bad!
[8325.19s -> 8328.33s]  What if I have to stop?
[8328.33s -> 8330.33s]  I could like relax for a minute. I actually like to
[8330.33s -> 8333.34s]  slow down. Don't remember that.
[8333.34s -> 8335.34s]  I want you to remember, remember like, remember Dollhouse.
[8335.34s -> 8337.34s]  And Replace, but don't remember
[8337.34s -> 8339.34s]  any of this. Don't remember any of these streams.
[8339.34s -> 8341.34s]  I want you to forget what you just watched. Don't watch it.
[8341.34s -> 8343.34s]  Think about it.
[8343.34s -> 8349.02s]  I want you to remember
[8349.02s -> 8351.58s]  the other stuff.
[8351.58s -> 8355.02s]  What happened? What happened?
[8355.02s -> 8361.42s]  Alright, I'm going for it this time for real.
[8361.42s -> 8364.41s]  I'm such an old
[8364.41s -> 8368.89s]  fuck. Are you serious?
[8368.89s -> 8370.89s]  I'm such an old fucking person.
[8370.89s -> 8372.89s]  What? I did this, I
[8372.89s -> 8374.89s]  danced for a second and I have to sit down.
[8374.89s -> 8377.32s]  I am sitting down.
[8377.32s -> 8379.62s]  I am sitting down right now.
[8379.62s -> 8383.34s]  I can't sit down any
[8383.34s -> 8385.34s]  more than I already am sitting down.
[8385.34s -> 8390.38s]  Oh my goodness.
[8390.38s -> 8392.38s]  Something really comical about that though.
[8392.38s -> 8394.62s]  Doing that dance in particular
[8394.62s -> 8396.62s]  you just get so winded that you're just
[8396.62s -> 8398.62s]  all fucked up now?
[8398.62s -> 8401.88s]  So too much
[8401.88s -> 8413.45s]  movement?
[8413.45s -> 8419.14s]  Just go lie in bed for a bed stream.
[8419.14s -> 8424.90s]  Take it easy old man. I am taking
[8424.90s -> 8428.17s]  it easy right now. I'm not going to
[8428.17s -> 8432.39s]  keel over. Do a sub-a-thon.
[8432.39s -> 8434.39s]  Do you understand how a sub-a-thon
[8434.39s -> 8436.39s]  on this channel? I would cap
[8436.39s -> 8438.70s]  the sub-a-thon. Guys, sub-a-thon!
[8438.70s -> 8440.70s]  Here we go! It's capped at 8 hours
[8440.70s -> 8443.32s]  by the way. That's it. I'm just
[8443.32s -> 8445.32s]  going to be a regular stream. I don't even care.
[8445.32s -> 8448.58s]  I would just say I would cap it at
[8448.58s -> 8454.28s]  not even a day. Or
[8454.28s -> 8456.28s]  one sub would
[8456.28s -> 8458.28s]  reduce time.
[8458.28s -> 8461.10s]  I would start it at
[8461.10s -> 8463.46s]  500 hours or something.
[8463.46s -> 8465.46s]  And every sub would reduce it by
[8465.46s -> 8467.64s]  30 seconds.
[8467.64s -> 8473.02s]  You guys would just force me off.
[8473.02s -> 8475.19s]  I didn't even fucking accelerate. I made it thank
[8475.19s -> 8494.01s]  God. Where do I go?
[8494.01s -> 8502.70s]  Excuse me? Where?
[8502.70s -> 8516.57s]  Jump on the boat.
[8516.57s -> 8518.57s]  That's how
[8518.57s -> 8524.65s]  the fucking movie ends.
[8524.65s -> 8526.65s]  They don't make that jump. It's incredibly difficult.
[8526.65s -> 8531.82s]  Oh.
[8531.82s -> 8533.82s]  Realistic. Yeah, that's
[8533.82s -> 8535.82s]  what would happen man. Nobody does that
[8535.82s -> 8538.38s]  jump. Nobody can make that jump.
[8538.38s -> 8540.38s]  007 failed.
[8540.38s -> 8542.38s]  Ay-ay-ay.
[8542.38s -> 8552.86s]  Okay.
[8552.86s -> 8554.86s]  We're relaxed now. We're relaxed.
[8554.86s -> 8567.21s]  I've got my breath again.
[8567.21s -> 8569.21s]  It was the cop thing. The siren fucked
[8569.21s -> 8573.88s]  me up. I've never heard of anybody
[8573.88s -> 8576.50s]  say the ay-ay-ay.
[8576.50s -> 8583.22s]  I say ay-ay-ay all the time. Ay-ay-ay
[8583.22s -> 8585.22s]  has so much.
[8585.22s -> 8587.22s]  There's so many different emotions behind it.
[8587.22s -> 8591.38s]  No. No, excuse me. Not
[8591.38s -> 8593.38s]  that one. Not with an A.
[8593.38s -> 8595.38s]  Ay-ay-ay!
[8595.38s -> 8597.62s]  Ay-ay-ay!
[8597.62s -> 8599.62s]  I say it all the time. It's like a thing I say.
[8599.62s -> 8603.08s]  I don't say. I don't do. I don't say
[8603.08s -> 8605.08s]  I'm not being said because everyone's going to
[8605.08s -> 8609.75s]  freak out. Can I shortcut? No.
[8609.75s -> 8613.34s]  You watch anime. I don't.
[8613.34s -> 8619.80s]  Somebody said birth canal.
[8619.80s -> 8625.18s]  What do you mean?
[8625.18s -> 8627.18s]  There's not going to be a birth canal ending here.
[8627.18s -> 8634.98s]  I need to pay attention.
[8634.98s -> 8637.35s]  It's okay. Did I not go through that
[8637.35s -> 8641.38s]  checkpoint? I didn't. How did I not hit
[8641.38s -> 8643.62s]  that checkpoint? I don't understand
[8643.62s -> 8645.62s]  how I didn't hit the. How did I not hit that
[8645.62s -> 8661.24s]  point? How is that possible?
[8661.24s -> 8671.61s]  How did I not hit the checkpoint?
[8671.61s -> 8673.61s]  DUN. DUN, DUN, DUN, DUN DUN,
[8673.61s -> 8675.61s]  DUN, DUN, DUN, DUN, DUN,
[8675.61s -> 8679.13s]  DUN, DUN, DUN, DUN, DUN,
[8679.13s -> 8682.71s]  DUN, DUN, DUN, DUN. That's such a
[8682.71s -> 8698.39s]  good song though. Clean,
[8698.39s -> 8700.39s]  clean. Clean.
[8700.39s -> 8702.63s]  Clean. Clean.
[8702.63s -> 8709.86s]  That was a clean turn.
[8709.86s -> 8719.77s]  Watch out!
[8719.77s -> 8721.77s]  Ba, ba, ba-da-da-da-da-da
[8721.77s -> 8734.38s]  Da. Oh.
[8734.38s -> 8736.38s]  Oh, reaction! Make a
[8736.38s -> 8740.38s]  I want to see you scream, streamer! I want to see you go whee!
[8740.38s -> 8742.58s]  Fuck off.
[8742.58s -> 8753.14s]  Alright, this is it, this is it, this is it, this is it.
[8753.14s -> 8762.86s]  Alright, slow down, slow down, don't go too fast.
[8762.86s -> 8780.96s]  I don't think I'm gonna be able to do this.
[8780.96s -> 8783.97s]  It still drives, it still drives, it still drives.
[8783.97s -> 8784.97s]  There's the checkpoint.
[8784.97s -> 8789.58s]  Alright, alright, alright, alright, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[8789.58s -> 8797.73s]  Just don't be an idiot.
[8797.73s -> 8799.73s]  Alright, this is the far- there's no time limit, so why do I care?
[8799.73s -> 8809.84s]  Alright, where's the jump?
[8809.84s -> 8820.85s]  Um, did I make it?
[8820.85s -> 8823.15s]  I made it! I actually did it!
[8823.15s -> 8828.30s]  I got it!
[8828.30s -> 8831.46s]  Nice.
[8831.46s -> 8833.82s]  Cool, alright, that was fun. That was actually pretty fun.
[8833.82s -> 8839.70s]  What's another one I should do?
[8839.70s -> 8841.51s]  Leap of Fate?
[8841.51s -> 8850.69s]  Try this one.
[8850.69s -> 8852.57s]  Do some more free roam?
[8852.57s -> 8858.89s]  I like these scenarios of fun.
[8858.89s -> 8859.89s]  This took you an hour.
[8859.89s -> 8864.89s]  Well, you have to be fair, there was a whole lot going on in the first 15 to 20 minutes of that run.
[8864.89s -> 8867.96s]  Your hair looks like a backwards hat.
[8867.96s -> 8879.81s]  It does?
[8879.81s -> 8880.81s]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[8880.81s -> 8896.55s]  Down up the cliffs, finishing with a courageous leap onto a rock pillar.
[8896.55s -> 8898.55s]  Oh, that's a good camera angle.
[8898.55s -> 8934.18s]  Nobody said it had to be clean.
[8934.18s -> 8935.18s]  I can't see.
[8935.18s -> 8939.62s]  Oh, fuck off.
[8939.62s -> 8941.62s]  Alright, just let me- I'm just doing it this way.
[8951.10s -> 8959.96s]  Slow down.
[8959.96s -> 8961.96s]  It's not about how cool you look, it's about getting it done.
[8961.96s -> 8968.06s]  This is a pretty good speed.
[8968.06s -> 8972.35s]  Oh, come on.
[8972.35s -> 8978.01s]  Stop.
[8978.01s -> 8979.01s]  Stop.
[8979.01s -> 8981.53s]  Stop it.
[8981.53s -> 9010.29s]  Really?
[9010.29s -> 9011.29s]  Forget about being cautious.
[9011.29s -> 9017.01s]  Fuck it, just go.
[9017.01s -> 9019.85s]  This one's impossible.
[9019.85s -> 9036.19s]  This one's impossible.
[9036.19s -> 9040.44s]  What the?
[9040.44s -> 9041.44s]  How are you supposed to go over that?
[9041.44s -> 9046.33s]  Go very slow?
[9046.33s -> 9047.33s]  I just went so slow.
[9047.33s -> 9071.93s]  Look at how slow I just went, it just hit me over.
[9071.93s -> 9075.73s]  STOP!
[9075.73s -> 9076.73s]  Oh my god, dude.
[9076.73s -> 9077.73s]  Give me a break.
[9077.73s -> 9084.56s]  Let me try this one more time.
[9084.56s -> 9090.92s]  One more time.
[9090.92s -> 9091.92s]  Play the video.
[9091.92s -> 9115.82s]  Sammy, please.
[9115.82s -> 9116.82s]  I beg you.
[9116.82s -> 9119.98s]  Meal, Sammy.
[9119.98s -> 9120.98s]  Fast.
[9120.98s -> 9121.98s]  Medium.
[9121.98s -> 9128.14s]  Left.
[9128.14s -> 9129.14s]  Stay center.
[9129.14s -> 9134.42s]  Please.
[9134.42s -> 9147.18s]  Medium.
[9147.18s -> 9148.18s]  Left.
[9148.18s -> 9149.18s]  Long.
[9149.18s -> 9155.34s]  Medium.
[9155.34s -> 9158.70s]  Right.
[9158.70s -> 9159.70s]  Concentrate.
[9159.70s -> 9161.19s]  Medium.
[9161.19s -> 9162.19s]  Left.
[9162.19s -> 9163.19s]  Meal.
[9163.19s -> 9164.19s]  Short.
[9164.19s -> 9165.19s]  Left.
[9165.19s -> 9167.20s]  Sammy, listen, Sammy.
[9167.20s -> 9168.20s]  Otherwise, it's not working, Sammy.
[9168.20s -> 9169.20s]  Seriously.
[9169.20s -> 9170.20s]  You are watching and driving.
[9170.20s -> 9171.20s]  You have to be easy, Sammy.
[9171.20s -> 9172.20s]  Otherwise, we won't win it.
[9172.20s -> 9173.20s]  You have to be easy, Sammy.
[9173.20s -> 9175.21s]  I'm telling you.
[9175.21s -> 9187.39s]  Where am I going?
[9187.39s -> 9192.41s]  Shut up, Sammy.
[9192.41s -> 9205.10s]  Stay on, Sammy.
[9205.10s -> 9227.34s]  Sammy, what are you...
[9227.34s -> 9228.34s]  We made it.
[9228.34s -> 9229.70s]  Fine.
[9229.70s -> 9230.70s]  We made it.
[9230.70s -> 9237.34s]  I don't know what direction I was supposed to be going.
[9237.34s -> 9244.42s]  Where am I going?
[9244.42s -> 9246.42s]  You got to stay on the road.
[9246.42s -> 9247.42s]  Oh, fuck it.
[9247.42s -> 9248.42s]  I'm done with this one.
[9248.42s -> 9249.42s]  This one was cool, but it's very hard.
[9249.42s -> 9251.42s]  I want to do the leap of faith though.
[9251.42s -> 9254.20s]  Where is it?
[9254.20s -> 9256.20s]  Where is the leap of faith?
[9256.20s -> 9257.20s]  It was a path.
[9257.20s -> 9278.00s]  I know, but I kind of went off the path.
[9278.00s -> 9279.00s]  Really?
[9279.00s -> 9292.85s]  Come on.
[9292.85s -> 9293.85s]  Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
[9293.85s -> 9318.16s]  That was fun. I want to do that one's too hard. Delivery? Deliver a trailer of Tasty Cola to the shop.
[9318.16s -> 9343.34s]  All right, go do some more smashing. I will. I will. Audio delay? Shouldn't be. Are you gonna do a Roblox stream?
[9343.34s -> 9354.78s]  No, one guy. Okay, deliver a
[9355.30s -> 9369.46s]  Trailer of Tasty Cola to the city. You got it. Oh, I need, oh.
[9370.18s -> 9378.12s]  I'm gonna go in the water.
[9380.63s -> 9409.80s]  All right. Well, just do it any, whatever. How do I put it on? Is there traffic or if there's no traffic I should be okay.
[9410.08s -> 9430.54s]  I should be fine, right? Who says I have to go fast?
[9441.22s -> 9449.09s]  What? Where's my height?
[9458.54s -> 9471.49s]  Sorry, how high should I be? This is a sharp right. Be careful. You guys remember those shoes that you used to pump?
[9471.69s -> 9477.40s]  What were those things called? I think they were just called pumps, right? Pumper's or something.
[9477.52s -> 9488.31s]  They're on the tongue of the shoe. You went, they were crazy. What were they called? Pumper's? Air Max.
[9488.73s -> 9493.88s]  Yeah, they were weird and all it did is just tightened to the shoe around you. It just kind of filled up air.
[9494.24s -> 9510.33s]  They were weird. I don't think they make them anymore. My eyes. I'm being so irritated. Okay, here we go. Let's deliver.
[9510.73s -> 9529.08s]  Deliver our delivery. What? I don't even know what happened. I just can't see. I can't, I just couldn't see.
[9529.08s -> 9532.09s]  I couldn't see where the car was driving.
[9532.61s -> 9553.74s]  What's, what's wrong with the car? I can't turn right. I actually can't turn the car right. What? Give me a break.
[9554.22s -> 9570.38s]  You gotta be kidding me. What was that? All right. I, I was gonna go back and smash cars into each other.
[9570.90s -> 9588.45s]  Okay, let me put the air, let me pump the air maxes. Now I'm ready. It's into my calls.
[9589.21s -> 9598.50s]  Driving a truck must, this must be the most terrifying thing.
[9600.76s -> 9606.61s]  Seriously, what an, what an unbelievable skill it takes to do this, to actually drive around like this.
[9606.61s -> 9613.99s]  I am, I already don't know sometimes if, that's, that turn looks kind of sharp. I gotta be careful.
[9614.23s -> 9618.84s]  Can you imagine what goes through the mind of somebody driving a truck like this when you have to take a sharp turn like that?
[9619.20s -> 9627.94s]  It's like, you have this insane huge thing. That's a skill. That's a heavy skill.
[9628.50s -> 9639.23s]  Your brother does this for a living? That's, that takes a lot of guts. It does. That takes a lot of balls.
[9639.23s -> 9648.16s]  It takes a lot of gumshoe to be able to drive something like this, especially around like a place like this.
[9652.51s -> 9655.63s]  I would be, I wouldn't know what to do. I would get out. I'd be like, somebody else has to drive this.
[9656.11s -> 9662.18s]  Somebody else has to do this. Wait, gumshoe. Isn't that what they called the
[9663.19s -> 9675.57s]  kid, the detective kids in, we're in the world's car in San Diego? Gumshoes. Yeah. What was I trying to say?
[9676.37s -> 9684.78s]  Gumshoes. Yeah. And I didn't even pay attention to the road. Where's the checkpoint? I gotta stop talking.
[9684.78s -> 9696.99s]  Oh my God. I can't do anything like this. What a great theme song, too. Should I start over again?
[9697.63s -> 9705.58s]  I can't just turn around. I can't just do a three-point turn. You know, my favorite part about
[9705.58s -> 9712.10s]  the, we're in the world's car in San Diego theme song. First of all, the beginning, it goes
[9715.62s -> 9720.21s]  That's a big part. And then in the middle, it's like,
[9723.25s -> 9733.84s]  the second verse went, where am I going? The part where the guy goes, stealing souls and stuff from
[9734.40s -> 9739.60s]  That's my, that, hold on. I could do that better. Stealing soul and stuff from making money.
[9740.96s -> 9753.81s]  That's the best part. Let's listen to it right now. What a classic. Oh, did you hear that part?
[9753.81s -> 9762.59s]  That's what I'm talking about. Let's wait for the next part. Oh, this is a fucking classic.
[9784.29s -> 9796.03s]  And here it goes, here it goes.
[9796.83s -> 9805.07s]  We go from Nashville to Norway, to Zimbabwe, to Chicago, to Czechoslovakia, and back.
[9805.87s -> 9821.66s]  I'm just crashing. I can't play video games and do this. I can't play a car driving video game.
[9822.30s -> 9828.06s]  We have to be careful. I can't turn the car anymore. We're not doing this one. We can do
[9828.06s -> 9834.54s]  something else. What? Okay. One more scenario. I want to finish the song though. It's a good song.
[9842.96s -> 9848.50s]  Carmen San Diego. Whoa.
[9852.34s -> 9858.18s]  I'm going to DMCA'd. It's a 1991 Carmen San Diego theme song for a game show.
[9861.34s -> 9875.86s]  What do you want me to do? Just give me the main menu.
[9875.86s -> 9909.39s]  Oh, dude. And then another one from this, at the very end of the game show, they had to go find
[9909.47s -> 9912.59s]  different countries and place little markers on them when they were like, oh, this is,
[9912.59s -> 9917.15s]  they would describe an area or describe a thing. The person had to put a little marker on a country
[9917.15s -> 9923.94s]  from where it was from. And the song, the song that they did, it's the same group. What's the
[9923.94s -> 9934.19s]  group? What's the name of the group? Okay. It was an acapella group. It was this. It was awesome.
[9934.19s -> 9943.50s]  I got to hear that too. What would it be called? Rockapella. Yep. That's the one. Okay. Let's do
[9944.46s -> 9956.19s]  where in the world is Carmen San Diego? Bum-de-bum, bum-de-bum, like bum-de-bum, bum-de-bum,
[9957.31s -> 9968.75s]  bum-de-bum. You guys know what I'm talking about? Carmen San Diego. What would it be called? Play
[9968.75s -> 9973.39s]  the game, please. This is really fucking important. Not Perry the Platypus theme. What are you? Get
[9973.39s -> 9982.27s]  out of here. That's no, that's not it. Where in the world is Carmen San Diego? Great core.
[9982.91s -> 10000.32s]  If somebody find it, I gotta go through this. Oh my God. All right. I didn't know I had that much
[10000.32s -> 10028.45s]  speed. What? I got it though. No, I got it. I got it. I got it. This thing's wicked fucked up,
[10028.45s -> 10072.51s]  but I got it. Oh, these tight turns. Oh shit. Find it. Oh, you got it. You got it. Is it?
[10072.51s -> 10088.98s]  This is the one I was talking about. This is the one I'm talking about. That's not it.
[10089.78s -> 10112.83s]  What the fuck? It was an opera. This is not it. This is not it. No, it's not even close.
[10112.83s -> 10121.07s]  It's bum-de-bum, bum-de-bum, bum-de-bum. This is an opera. This is a chorus singing opera.
[10126.22s -> 10135.31s]  No, that's not it. That's not it. It's from the TV show. It's from the game show. It's from the
[10135.31s -> 10142.66s]  game show. It was the very end. It was a kid. It was the last part of the show. It was the kid
[10142.66s -> 10146.34s]  running around with a marker and they had to place it on this big map they were running all over.
[10146.90s -> 10161.44s]  And he was like, I'll find Norway. And the kid had to run around and place it on Norway. Oh,
[10161.44s -> 10173.42s]  no way do I get out of here. Oh my God. It's so hard. Yep. Is this it? They said I can't
[10173.42s -> 10184.45s]  hear it very well, but this is it. Get set, go. Come on to Chad. Chad. This is it. Chad.
[10184.45s -> 10194.70s]  No, that's not it. Try it again. Come on, Tetsuo. Yeah, that's it. Come on. Yes, sir. Come on.
[10200.64s -> 10209.47s]  You got it. Come on. You got it. Come on. All right, we can go back.
[10210.03s -> 10212.99s]  There's like 3,000 of you that left and came back. You can come back now.
[10217.18s -> 10226.86s]  Where is Carmen Sandiego? What the fuck is opera? Oh, you know that one that goes bum-de-bum,
[10227.82s -> 10247.49s]  bum-de-bum. I'm just going to do the fucking crash and just upload. It's much more my speed,
[10247.49s -> 10262.32s]  I think. That's way more my speed. Oh, Jungle Rock Island. Let's go. Where should I go?
[10262.32s -> 10268.86s]  Do one of the chases. Oh, wait a minute. Oh, that's a good idea. That's not fun. All right.
[10268.86s -> 10276.66s]  East Coast chase one. This one's a medium difficulty. How are you so consistently bad
[10276.66s -> 10295.04s]  at this game? Because I'm doing it to deliberately make you angry. You only. Only you. Only you.
[10295.04s -> 10300.08s]  All right. I wanted individuals to be spotted near the sawmill. Somebody fell into the lake.
[10305.44s -> 10326.83s]  I'm just kidding. Relax. There they are. It's a realistic driving game. Sorry I don't have a
[10326.83s -> 10336.22s]  pedal or a steering wheel. I did the tutorial an hour and 10 minutes ago. What do you want me to
[10336.22s -> 10354.72s]  say? This car drives like shit. It's one of those cars that drives like shit. All right,
[10354.72s -> 10365.79s]  get slowed down. All right. Don't peel out here. That's what happened last time. And just wait.
[10365.79s -> 10371.79s]  He's going to jump. Do the jump. There it is. This dirt ass road that I can't drive on. This
[10371.79s -> 10379.09s]  car is not meant to drive on this road. Where'd you go? All right. Keep going. This. Um,
[10379.81s -> 10387.95s]  did I cut him off or something? Or was I supposed to go that way? I don't know which way he went.
[10388.51s -> 10396.91s]  Did he go this way? I don't know which way. I don't know which way the fucking guy went.
[10398.06s -> 10405.34s]  This is so hard. This is so hard. I feel like I'm driving. I feel like I'm driving every car in
[10405.34s -> 10413.26s]  this game in an ice in one of those tabletop ice hockey rinks. What are they called? Air hockey.
[10413.26s -> 10420.85s]  All these cars are air hockey rinks. It's just I'm playing fucking air hockey.
[10421.41s -> 10474.86s]  Fucking God. It wouldn't. It doesn't. It's not hard to do that. How am I supposed to get this
[10474.86s -> 10484.18s]  close? I'm pushing. I'm doing 70 fucking miles per hour and I'm doing these tight turns. I'm
[10484.18s -> 10498.62s]  going to crash. Where'd he go? Where'd he go? Where'd he go? This way. It's fucking impossible.
[10498.62s -> 10503.81s]  It is so hard to drive in this game. This is the hardest driving game I've ever done in my
[10503.81s -> 10513.73s]  fucking life. It is so difficult to drive car in this game. You got to drift. Yeah. When I
[10513.73s -> 10525.06s]  start drifting, I don't stop drifting and I just don't. I can't turn the car. I can't even turn
[10525.06s -> 10557.38s]  the car. I can't turn. I feel like I'm in a tank. This is slippery ass bullshit. I'm on icicles
[10557.38s -> 10568.66s]  right now. I'm driving on a bed of ice on every course. I have no control of the car. Do you see
[10568.66s -> 10592.91s]  this? I don't have any control. I have no control of the car. I don't. I actually don't have control.
[10592.91s -> 10597.87s]  Those of you who think this is like GTA 5 driving, you are out of your fucking mind.
[10598.59s -> 10604.43s]  Those of you who think that, dude, what the fuck? This is not GTA 5 driving. This is very, very
[10604.43s -> 10638.06s]  difficult. It's very difficult. It's incredibly difficult. Where the fuck is he? I didn't even
[10638.06s -> 10665.28s]  pay attention. Just crash. I don't care. This one's easy. Relax. I think your next game intuition is
[10665.92s -> 10672.54s]  no, no, I don't need next game. It's really hard. I'm relaxed. I'm fine. I'm just very mad about
[10672.54s -> 10680.98s]  sliding around on icicles in my car. And then when I turn the wheel like this, the car just goes,
[10698.43s -> 10700.91s]  how am I supposed to know that? That's how I'm supposed to know where I'm supposed to go.
[10758.74s -> 10764.06s]  All right. I'm fucking doing this one. I don't care. Why does his mouth not move?
[10764.80s -> 10768.64s]  I don't know because sometimes my mouth doesn't move. Sometimes your mouth doesn't move when you
[10768.64s -> 10773.52s]  scream. I'll fuck with, yeah, I'll fuck with gravity. I'll do that. I'm going to get out of it.
[10773.52s -> 10780.94s]  It's so addicting. But I was literally, I was pressing left so hard that the stick came out of
[10780.94s -> 10834.19s]  its socket. It went even more left. It went over heel left. He crashed. I did it. I won.
[10836.82s -> 10846.91s]  He crashed without me. Just get in front of the car. Dude, he's done. He's done. He's not going
[10846.91s -> 10859.06s]  anywhere. You're not going to escape, man. It's over. I don't know what you crashed into,
[10859.62s -> 10882.51s]  but I got you. All right. One more. Whoa. This one. He still chips.
[10891.44s -> 10901.22s]  All right. Jump from the dam and aim for the targets. Fuck it. Who cares? Just go.
[10904.50s -> 10919.41s]  All right. Well, I didn't know what it was going to be. This person just showing up.
[10919.41s -> 10928.21s]  Get on the road. All right. Up and over. All right. How many points did I get? Zero.
[10936.43s -> 10940.75s]  Okay. I didn't. I actually didn't even. What? Okay. This is. Do it again. Do it again.
[10951.30s -> 10974.99s]  Oh, you got to go really slow. Now you speed it up. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.
[10978.43s -> 11019.81s]  Slow down a little bit. Way too short. I think that's it. Oh, yes. Got it. That was almost
[11019.81s -> 11026.14s]  a perfect bullseye. Let's do it again. This one even further. How am I going to get the one all
[11026.14s -> 11031.42s]  the way back there? That one seems really far away. All the way in the back in the river.
[11038.34s -> 11045.57s]  I don't think I'm going to hit that one. How are you supposed to get that one? Look at that.
[11045.57s -> 11058.94s]  Don't do the taxi. Oh, okay. I thought I had to use this car. We'll do a super fast car.
[11059.50s -> 11081.78s]  What's the fastest car in the game? It's not even close to being fast.
[11082.74s -> 11102.75s]  That's not going to do it. I need the rocket bus. Will that actually do it? How do I press the
[11102.75s -> 11152.32s]  button? Holy shit. That turned into a piece of taffy. All right. I get it. Way too powerful.
[11174.22s -> 11219.87s]  I got to try to get it. That was fun. That was fun. How about cliff?
[11225.81s -> 11264.78s]  Cliff. And we'll use this one. Really, it's just a cliff. So a lot of people say,
[11265.42s -> 11270.08s]  man, look at all this technology with the soft body damage and the car damage. This is so cool.
[11270.64s -> 11277.39s]  Everybody was talking about how cool this was when this game came out, right? In about five
[11277.39s -> 11284.27s]  to 10 years almost. The reason why they can't put this in games and why most car damage is kind of,
[11284.27s -> 11290.35s]  it's okay, is because my computer right now is spending all of its resources rendering that.
[11293.01s -> 11300.53s]  And correct me if I'm wrong, but you kind of can't render that everywhere. That accurate?
[11305.33s -> 11316.46s]  Maybe one day. That was really fun. Let me do it with a fast car. Let me do it with the bus.
[11316.46s -> 11336.22s]  No, what the fuck? I'm trying to go fast. This thing broke his neck. Start over. Start over.
[11336.22s -> 11367.98s]  Again. R. How come R's not working? R's not working. R. There we go. Wait, I want to see
[11367.98s -> 11401.94s]  from here. Where am I? I want to get a bit. I want to, there we go. That's better.
[11407.65s -> 11421.82s]  That was tons of damage. That's what in this part of the movie, all the main characters are all,
[11422.94s -> 11427.58s]  maybe one of them has a scratch right here with a little bit of blood and a tiny bruise.
[11427.58s -> 11435.76s]  And they all go in like this. Is everything okay? One person's kind of lying down in dirt here.
[11435.76s -> 11458.90s]  They're all fine. All right. Let's do another map. I want to do, I want some more cars on the road.
[11458.90s -> 11467.65s]  How about, how about just East Coast USA? Gas station, parking lot, farmhouse, town, highway.
[11467.65s -> 11474.32s]  Ooh, let's do the highway. Change the gravity. Yeah. I'm going to do a bunch of weird shit.
[11476.42s -> 11482.66s]  Let's turn traffic on. Let's do, there's probably a piece of big thing of concrete in the way.
[11482.66s -> 11498.66s]  Do the sawmill. Still haven't done the cannon. It's been three hours and no cannon.
[11498.66s -> 11507.54s]  A hundred times slower than real time. What? Okay. That's kind of insane. All right. I want,
[11507.54s -> 11526.10s]  I want a different car. I want to drive this, just like a van or something. This is a Scooby-Doo van.
[11526.10s -> 11542.00s]  Is this the mystery machine? It actually is. Okay. Go to the environments tab. Play. Okay. Noon.
[11542.00s -> 11561.15s]  Go to noon. Cloud speed. Fog. It gets foggy. Simulation speed. Gravity. Moon. Okay. Let's do
[11561.15s -> 11583.57s]  vehicle config. Okay. Zoinks. And now I need to do, I want AI. Traffic. Spawn traffic. And let's
[11583.57s -> 11603.47s]  give it a shot. It's spawning a lot of cars. Okay. Here we go. Let's, let's drive. We need a shaggy
[11603.47s -> 11613.78s]  impression. Like, oh, this is quality entertainment. Like, this is quality entertainment,
[11613.78s -> 11628.53s]  Scoob. Not bad. Not bad. That wasn't bad. It actually wasn't even bad. That actually was not
[11628.53s -> 11653.90s]  bad. That actually wasn't. I wasn't. Should we just put on the Scooby-Doo theme song and just drive
[11653.90s -> 11660.43s]  around? I love how this stream has just seriously been, put on a song and drive to the song until
[11660.43s -> 11665.46s]  you crash into a wall. This is the only thing we've been, that's all the content. That's the
[11665.46s -> 11671.06s]  content of the entire day. It's been, it's been every single piece of content that we have done
[11671.06s -> 11678.46s]  for over three plus three and a half hours. It's great. It's great content. It's amazing content.
[11678.46s -> 11683.34s]  Okay. So here's the deal. Um, okay. If we're going to make it at night, it's going to be
[11683.34s -> 11689.04s]  spooky. And we're going to put on the mystery machine theme song of whatever the hell it is.
[11689.04s -> 11716.67s]  Okay. Whatever. This is, um, Scooby. What's, what's new Scooby-Doo? Is that a good one?
[11716.67s -> 11723.95s]  Yeah, I find that mystery. This is Scooby-Doo. Coming after you. Fuck the Scooby-Doo.
[11724.67s -> 11730.10s]  This is the fucking new Zoomer shit. This is not what I want. This is the new Zoomer shit.
[11730.10s -> 11745.33s]  And by the way, that song is very good. I, I, I'm full of shit by the way. Actually,
[11745.33s -> 11756.69s]  this one might be better than the original. This one might be better than the original song.
[11756.69s -> 11764.51s]  That's better than the original song. Really? And I think it might be. All right, let's get,
[11764.51s -> 11773.90s]  let's get, uh, what we want here. I want it to be nighttime. I'm going to go solve that mystery.
[11774.30s -> 11780.08s]  Make it foggy. Right? Nice. Ooh, scary. Earth gravity. No more of this bullshit.
[11780.08s -> 11788.30s]  Okay. Now I need, I need, uh, headlights. How do I turn the headlights on? How do you turn on
[11788.30s -> 11805.73s]  the headlights? And I gotta, I gotta be off camera. I need my headlights. L plus shut off.
[11805.73s -> 11812.78s]  Wow. What is it? T? How do I turn the headlights on? N. Okay. Thank you.
[11813.42s -> 11816.98s]  All right. You guys ready? You guys ready for, to solve the mystery? You ready to do the joke
[11816.98s -> 11820.90s]  we've done 10 times today? I, I hope you're ready. Here we go.
[11823.22s -> 11829.02s]  Time to solve that mystery. Wait, let me turn this down. This is going to be so loud.
[11829.02s -> 11834.59s]  All right, dude, we're just replacing the actors. We're doing the same movie.
[11842.82s -> 11858.48s]  Okay. Here we go. It's too dark.
[11877.89s -> 11881.17s]  It's too dark, man. I can't actually guess where I'm driving.
[11883.33s -> 11889.34s]  Yeah. All right. I'll try it again. I have to do it until I can. Okay. Here's the,
[11889.34s -> 11893.36s]  are you guys ready for the fucking challenge of the evening? The challenge of the evening is
[11893.36s -> 11899.94s]  I'm going to try to drive pretty much. I can't go under 20 miles per hour or at least the intro of
[11899.94s -> 11908.10s]  this show. I have to try to do this for the intro of the show. Just one full intro. You ready? Here
[11908.10s -> 11963.23s]  we go. What's headlights? I'll try it again. I'll try it again. I need to have the headlights on
[11964.99s -> 11970.24s]  and are they on? All right. Let me get to a different fucking spot. Like let me get to a
[11970.24s -> 11975.71s]  different spot. This spot sucks. It's, I can't see what I'm doing. I can't see where I'm going
[11975.71s -> 12007.74s]  and I gotta hold on. They gotta make this even better. Come on. Come on. Okay. Here we go. How
[12007.74s -> 12015.57s]  is this going to sound? Let's see. I'm just going to put on like just background voice lines from
[12015.57s -> 12022.77s]  the, okay. This should be pretty, this should be all right. I need to get a better spot too, dude.
[12022.77s -> 12032.13s]  Like this is going to be too hard. Let me get across the bridge. I gotta make sure the audio
[12032.13s -> 12035.17s]  isn't all fucked up too. All right. I want to make sure, let me turn the fog down because you
[12035.17s -> 12043.34s]  can't see shit. Turn the fog down. That's way better. Now we can actually see what we're doing.
[12043.34s -> 12059.33s]  Okay. You guys ready? I'm ready. I'm ready to start this. I gotta get through one cycle.
[12062.98s -> 12068.98s]  Let me get over here. One cycle of the theme song. That's all I'm looking for.
[12069.94s -> 12078.94s]  Set this to home. Thank you for reminding me. Sounds good. Okay. Make sure the audio levels are
[12078.94s -> 12108.70s]  good in three, two, one. It's too soft. It's too soft. The music's overpowering everything.
[12113.89s -> 12115.89s]  That was the worst one by far.
[12116.37s -> 12125.84s]  The gang calls the insurance company. All right. I need a good, okay. This is a better audio level.
[12126.64s -> 12143.18s]  Okay. Okay. All right. All right. All right. You guys ready? I'm going to start over again.
[12143.18s -> 12151.34s]  I have to do this till I get through one cycle. And turn the headlights on. Three, two, one.
[12153.82s -> 12204.38s]  What? God damn it. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right.
[12204.38s -> 12220.50s]  I'm going to do this one more time and I'm moving on again. Final time. Final time. Two times the song.
[12257.39s -> 12260.67s]  That's so fucked up. That's so fucked up. Like we're going to crash.
[12264.54s -> 12270.85s]  God damn it. All right. Let's go. Ready? Hey, Scooby-Doo. What's new? What's new, Scooby-Doo?
[12270.85s -> 12370.32s]  How are you? The car is so fucked up. I feel like my brain is rotting.
[12451.92s -> 12456.62s]  All right. Hold on. I need to pause. I need to pause. My fucking head hurts.
[12456.62s -> 12462.67s]  Scooby went through the shack. How many times has Scooby crashed?
[12464.42s -> 12473.58s]  I feel like I was rotting your brains. I'm so sorry. I feel like everybody just is dumber
[12473.58s -> 12479.06s]  because of what just happened. I think everybody collectively, if they were ever going to be a
[12479.06s -> 12484.38s]  scientist, they'd want to do some observation here. The last five minutes, I think, may have
[12484.38s -> 12489.50s]  dropped everybody's IQ here by five points. I think it happened. I really think it might have
[12489.50s -> 12507.30s]  happened. I'm sorry. This has been playing the whole time muted. I'm back. That's too much.
[12507.30s -> 12521.92s]  Oh, Scooby, you can't stop. What an absolute nightmare. Digitally, why would you? I have a
[12521.92s -> 12537.95s]  test tomorrow. Why would you do that to me? God, what happened here? My favorite one, I think,
[12538.43s -> 12543.31s]  is the bus. Just immediately, the intro starts and they crash directly into a bus.
[12543.31s -> 12548.11s]  Immediately. The intro doesn't even happen yet. Here we go. Let's go on.
[12552.18s -> 12556.48s]  Finals are coming up. Oh, they are. That's right. Well, good luck on them. Hope you do all right.
[12559.41s -> 12570.62s]  Do Torgos theme. What's this Scooby do? Coming after you. I just want to hear the song now.
[12570.62s -> 12576.13s]  What a great tune. You know what I mean? It's a great song.
[12585.44s -> 12607.68s]  Who made this? Who made this one? Simple plan. Great job. I mean, they actually did a great job.
[12607.68s -> 12612.96s]  You know, here's the thing. A lot of times they have a popular band at the time do a theme song
[12612.96s -> 12616.72s]  for a show. Usually like, whoa, hold on a second there. I'm not so sure about that.
[12619.07s -> 12627.31s]  This is very, very good. They've ruined it. No, not this one. I think this is a good modern
[12627.31s -> 12639.04s]  take on it. I think it's great. I think they did a fantastic job. This is horrible. That was not.
[12639.68s -> 12663.33s]  This is not simple plan. And why is this in the road? Why was that in the road?
[12663.33s -> 12669.81s]  It is simple plan. All right. Well, they did a great job. All right. I want to change,
[12669.81s -> 12686.64s]  change scenery. I want to change scenery. I hit that earlier. I did go back to the grid.
[12686.64s -> 12706.83s]  Go to Utah, Utah. Let me go to the, uh, Jesus. What should I go? Scooby do devs in the chat.
[12706.83s -> 12714.48s]  That'd be weird considering thousands of people have worked on that show over the last 60 years.
[12714.48s -> 12721.38s]  It'd be, uh, okay. What do you mean the dev is here? Oh, maybe the repair zone.
[12721.38s -> 12732.40s]  Let's check this out. The dev, the dev is here.
[12744.51s -> 12752.10s]  All right. How's this one look? And the gas station explode. Zero. Give it a zero. Give the
[12752.10s -> 12767.97s]  game a zero. I can't move. I want to spawn. What is this thing here? What's the bus for?
[12767.97s -> 12788.48s]  This bus station thing. Bus driver. What is that? Mr. Do is here. Mr. Scooby do. Oh,
[12788.48s -> 12797.09s]  it's like a desert bus. Okay. I'm on a new car. First of all, manage, manage select.
[12801.74s -> 12805.81s]  I have not played with the cannon. So I'm going to take it out. These people are saying play with
[12805.81s -> 12811.28s]  the cannon, bro. Have you not shot the cannon yet? Cause you probably can shoot it. You can.
[12811.28s -> 12814.48s]  I did not. Okay. Didn't know you could shoot the cannon. So what do you want to say?
[12814.48s -> 12823.81s]  I wasn't aware of that. Cannonball was already fired. I can't shoot it again.
[12823.81s -> 12846.64s]  How do you reload it? Okay. Let's do something with the cannon. Press insert. Oh, okay.
[12846.64s -> 12858.13s]  Let me turn on traffic. No, I don't want to play that again. No, no, no, no, no, no. Back,
[12858.13s -> 12866.59s]  back, back. What about fun stuff? Break, fire, hint. What is this? What's this for? Tires?
[12866.59s -> 12872.93s]  I just popped the tires. Okay. Well, that's annoying. All right. Let's spawn everybody.
[12874.45s -> 12881.84s]  See if we can have a little bit of fun. And then we're going to change a couple of things.
[12881.84s -> 12898.56s]  I want to do electrics. Yeah. All right. Shut up. All right. Let's shoot somebody with a cannon.
[12905.62s -> 12918.35s]  Holy shit. Oh, slow mo. Slow mo. I'm going to do super slow mo. This is going to be insane.
[12918.35s -> 12925.98s]  All right. Hold on. I want to put something here. I'm going to spawn something. I want to spawn
[12925.98s -> 12939.68s]  a car and I want to do 100 times slow mo. Let me one of these. Yeah. Just like a van. Okay.
[12939.68s -> 12945.25s]  And then I want to do a camera angle here. No, I want to be, wait, I want to get a good view.
[12945.25s -> 12976.35s]  This is going to be sick. Hey bro, check this out. Hey, you ready? I'm sure I'm facing the right
[12976.35s -> 13003.71s]  way. I'm not. I'm, this would have completely missed. This is it. You guys ready? Three, two,
[13005.14s -> 13052.90s]  one. Fire. Holy shit. Wait, reset. That was pretty crazy. What happened to my cannon? Oh,
[13052.90s -> 13067.22s]  that's not the cannon. Where's the cannon? Okay. Watch this. Ready? This is going to be weird.
[13067.22s -> 13185.84s]  Watch this one. Check this out. This is going to be crazy. Went under. I know it didn't. Wow.
[13185.84s -> 13196.02s]  That doesn't do way more damage. Insane. Oh, insane, man. Insane. It's going to go through
[13196.02s -> 13222.19s]  the windshield. All right. Reset. Dude. Insane. Hey, hey, quiet. It hit the engine block. Wait,
[13222.19s -> 13230.74s]  what if I do this? Will it come through the back door? Find out. God, here we go. Cool. This is a
[13230.74s -> 13248.34s]  cool experiment. Bat chest, bat chest, bat chest, bat chest. Why am I getting bat chested? This is
[13248.34s -> 13264.61s]  cool. That was really loud. I'm sorry. All right. Check this out. Here we go. This is going to be
[13264.61s -> 13317.74s]  crazy insane. This is going to be crazy insane. Here it comes. What? It went all the way through,
[13317.74s -> 13340.93s]  but it stopped. Guys, guys, it stopped. Guys, it stopped. It's kind of fun, actually. This is minor
[13340.93s -> 13347.15s]  damage. That's kind of minor. Yeah. It is like just minor damage to the, but they would explode.
[13347.15s -> 13384.06s]  Put on afic, Maria. Wait. Okay. Hold on. I want a different car. This one is too sturdy. Something
[13384.06s -> 13398.29s]  different. I mean, this is too sturdy. I'm just like, just like on one of these cars.
[13398.29s -> 13411.65s]  What's new Scooby Doo coming after you. It's stuck in my head. It's an ear. It's just in there.
[13411.65s -> 13462.11s]  Okay. Do you want to play Ave Maria? Hitman song. This one is the hitman song, right? All right. I
[13462.11s -> 13475.41s]  guess we're going to do this. Let's, let's go. Let me set it up. This is DMCA warning. You know
[13475.41s -> 13486.83s]  what? Let me tell you something. We used to do this thing on the channel where it was called
[13486.83s -> 13496.21s]  community content night. And I, I would have just tons of videos and tons of stuff people would make
[13496.21s -> 13500.69s]  that had a shitload of copyright material in it. Right. And eventually it got to the point where
[13500.69s -> 13504.77s]  it was like, wait a minute. No, don't do that because we've got to be careful of the Twitch
[13504.77s -> 13511.17s]  DMCA stuff. And it like kind of didn't really matter. I probably could have kept doing it.
[13513.12s -> 13520.29s]  It kind of sad because I kind of canned that two years ago or so. And it was this big scare about
[13520.29s -> 13528.82s]  DMCA. And I don't know. It seems like that wasn't that big of a problem. Um, in, you know,
[13528.82s -> 13538.45s]  2020 hindsight here, the Scooby Doo song probably already got claimed. Yeah. So like the VOD might
[13538.45s -> 13545.10s]  not be watchable. It'd be muted, which sucks, but I don't know. There was a big scare where it was
[13545.10s -> 13548.78s]  like your whole channel is going to get deleted. Everything, delete everything. They're going to,
[13548.78s -> 13553.73s]  they're coming. They're going to strike you. And this just didn't happen. Um, it happened. Maybe
[13553.73s -> 13558.72s]  it happened. Did it happen to anybody? And especially with all the stuff, weren't people
[13558.72s -> 13566.14s]  watching like television shows? I was terrified. There was a, there was one time there was a clip
[13566.70s -> 13573.74s]  where it was Star Wars. It was like six minutes of Star Wars with a bunch of me being put in place
[13573.74s -> 13579.98s]  of other characters. And I was so paranoid. I was sitting there going, I'm going to, this is bad.
[13579.98s -> 13585.39s]  I can't just, we're just watching Star Wars right now. We're just watching Star Wars. And, and then
[13586.43s -> 13593.78s]  I have people watching TV shows and I'm just sitting there going, I was so scared of having
[13593.78s -> 13600.48s]  a minute or two of Star Wars with a bunch of shit in it. So now I've, maybe I would bring it back.
[13600.48s -> 13607.76s]  I was terrified at the videos. Yeah. We'll probably, what we could probably do. Yeah. Some
[13607.76s -> 13615.01s]  people did get hit by some, yeah. Some streamers did get hit by DMCA. Yeah. But I feel like it
[13615.01s -> 13621.06s]  would be okay. I just thought they were coming down hard and that it was any copyright material
[13621.06s -> 13629.47s]  was going to get you just, just dunked on. But that wasn't the case at all. It's not as bad.
[13629.47s -> 13633.25s]  Nowadays. Yeah. I don't know. I was just like, okay, I guess we're going to try bring it back.
[13634.75s -> 13641.39s]  If I was going to bring it, I can't bring it back. I can't bring it back unless I go in front of the
[13641.39s -> 13649.22s]  screen again. That's how it works. I would only be able to bring it back if I did it again,
[13649.22s -> 13656.22s]  a third time, because then there would be even more. And that's when it'd be, all right, let's
[13656.22s -> 13660.70s]  go. I would do green screen night, green skin on a car, green screen. I think that would be fun.
[13660.70s -> 13666.08s]  We would basically have to say no music. And if it was gonna, if you're going to do something
[13666.08s -> 13672.00s]  copywritten, it would have to be enough would have to have been changed for it to be okay. Right.
[13672.00s -> 13675.71s]  But I remember when that happened, I remember sitting there going, this is bad. I got a can.
[13675.71s -> 13679.39s]  This is one of my favorite. That was one of my favorite things on the channel. My favorite things.
[13680.53s -> 13684.77s]  And we had to get rid of it because I was scared of DMCA. And then like I said,
[13684.77s -> 13691.20s]  a year or two later, it turns out of all the, everyone was so afraid that maybe that wasn't
[13691.20s -> 13697.15s]  such a big deal or who knows? I watch it. I will do that. I'll bring that back.
[13697.71s -> 13701.47s]  And there'll be a clip that gets me fucking destroyed. You know what I mean? It's just how
[13701.47s -> 13707.92s]  it's just hard to tell just how am I supposed to even know it's going to happen. So let's go
[13707.92s -> 13710.96s]  ahead and do this and get the channels fucking shut down forever.
[13796.22s -> 13828.06s]  Rim. Oh, that's funny. What's new Scooby Doo? That's funny. And he said that without a smile.
[13828.06s -> 13839.49s]  Actually that destroyed this car. Jeez. Can it still drive? This thing can still drive.
[13851.78s -> 13861.22s]  Ow. Shoot it again. I'll shoot it again. I'm going to shoot it right here.
[14006.91s -> 14041.17s]  Why are there so many fucking cars? Oh no.
[14047.23s -> 14056.21s]  Why did it stop? The music stopped. Who the fuck is this? Why did the music stop?
[14057.81s -> 14072.58s]  The music stopped. That was, I, what the, what, what happened? Uh, I actually like can't load
[14072.58s -> 14099.01s]  this video. Live DMCA. They had enough. Hold on. Who is beeping this horn? Who is doing this?
[14104.13s -> 14139.57s]  What's this guy's problem? You holding the horn down? This guy's a dick. What the hell?
[14140.13s -> 14157.28s]  Who the fuck is this? Who is this? What? Who is this? Why? Why did that person drive off the
[14157.28s -> 14169.46s]  clip? Why am I in this person's car? I can't control it. I can't control this person's car.
[14170.82s -> 14192.88s]  I can't. All right. I, I won. Okay. This is it. Last one. And I'm turning this off forever.
[14192.88s -> 14198.91s]  I'm going to have to AI chase the car. Chase me. Everybody. Let's go. Fucking who cares? This is
[14198.91s -> 14218.82s]  it. After that. Nope. Right now. What happened? No. Fuck you. Get me out of this. They're all here.
[14218.82s -> 14242.83s]  Somebody help. Help. Please help me. I can't fucking move. I have to respawn. Hold on. Hold on.
[14244.43s -> 14249.55s]  Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on everybody. Wait. Wait. Wait.
[14249.55s -> 14272.54s]  Wait. I'll fix it. I'll fix it. I'll fix it. Everybody come get me. Okay. Pause it. Pause it.
[14272.54s -> 14275.10s]  Pause it. Okay. You guys ready? This is it. This is it. This is literally it.
[14277.44s -> 14301.34s]  That's good. Right there. Like it's got to be bright. All right. Here we go.
[14301.34s -> 14311.52s]  Play the fucking song. I'm gonna. Oh my God. Here we go. This is it. I promise I'm not doing
[14311.52s -> 14344.54s]  this ever again. I have to restart. I have to restart. Here they come. They're coming after us.
[14373.97s -> 14395.10s]  No. I thought I got out. Who's the cameraman? You suck.
[14397.98s -> 14407.74s]  Stop. I need to just drive. Get away from me. What's happening? What happened? What?
[14408.62s -> 14421.84s]  Why did this happen? I don't even understand. Wait. There's another Scooby-Doo fan coming after us.
[14424.11s -> 14442.05s]  I need to respawn. Hold on. Give me a second. I can't even trust. I can't trust that Scooby-Doo truck.
[14449.66s -> 14478.93s]  No. No. No. No. No. I knew they were coming. I had to get off the road.
[14479.65s -> 14511.46s]  I can't anymore. It's time to turn it off. I have no control of the car.
[14518.24s -> 14525.38s]  This is so fucking horrible. This imagery is like not okay. This is not okay.
[14526.02s -> 14536.77s]  This imagery is like not cool. Oh no. The other mystery machine.
[14537.57s -> 14548.98s]  Are they gonna make it? I might get out. I think I'm gonna get out. I'm gonna get out.
[14551.18s -> 14558.93s]  I'm out. Hold on. Wait a minute. He's still coming.
[14586.67s -> 14593.22s]  I'm done. I'm done. Stream's over. I'm turning this off. I'm fucking out of here. I'm fucking out
[14593.22s -> 14606.35s]  of here. This is too much. I'm done. Imagine if the fucking Scooby-Doo intro was this long,
[14606.35s -> 14620.96s]  by the way. Why is this? Oh, it's 10 hour version. It's the 10 hour version. I can't even fucking
[14620.96s -> 14703.54s]  crawl. Oh no. How am I still driving? You missed. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. This is bad.
[14704.34s -> 14745.17s]  This is bad. That's it. What a wacky adaptation. Helicopter shot.
[14747.63s -> 14759.60s]  That was playing for seven minutes. Oh, the imposter vans too. What a long intro. That's
[14759.60s -> 14776.67s]  the intro to what's new Scooby-Doo is them just getting crashed into. Oh Jesus. I have a fucking
[14776.67s -> 14795.14s]  headache. Oh my God. You know, I thought, I know that there's such a, I know it's gonna be a car
[14795.14s -> 14799.54s]  game and you're gonna crash your car and you're gonna laugh. I didn't think that was gonna happen.
[14799.54s -> 14804.98s]  I honestly, no, I'm not gonna fulfill the destiny of every stream. I'm not gonna laugh at the car
[14804.98s -> 14813.60s]  accident. I laughed until I had a headache. Put on the Breaking Bad theme. Okay, fine. You know what?
[14813.60s -> 14831.66s]  I have to. This is too funny. What's going on here? With the mystery mobile? God damn it. All right,
[14831.66s -> 14851.70s]  this is it. After this, I have to stop. My fucking head's gonna explode. Need to get an RV. God damn
[14851.70s -> 14857.73s]  it, man. All right, fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. I'll get an RV. I'll get an RV. And
[14857.73s -> 14887.70s]  this is it. No more after this. I'm done. What would it be under? Like this? What would it be under?
[14887.70s -> 14906.93s]  This thing? No. Travel trailer? Travel trailer. Oh, yep. God damn it, this is so stupid. This thing
[14906.93s -> 14940.93s]  can't drive. Can it? I can't drive this. I can't drive it. Oh, here we go, here we go, here we go.
[14940.93s -> 14962.58s]  I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going. I'm going, I'm going, I'm going. It's not gonna work.
[14963.14s -> 14975.98s]  This is not gonna work. I'm done. I have to put a truck on it. I think this one will work.
[14975.98s -> 14997.20s]  This is fine. Just pretend this is an RV. Yeah, like this one. Just use the van. That's a bus.
[14997.20s -> 15017.82s]  We need to go somewhere else too. Long jump cliff? Oh, this is GPS. I don't know how to do that.
[15022.90s -> 15040.61s]  Okay, it was Utah. Where the hell is Utah? Now we want to go to airfield. We gotta go way out there.
[15040.61s -> 15049.70s]  Yeah, we're going to the airfield. Put a yellow filter on. Okay, and you know what I'm gonna do.
[15062.88s -> 15075.63s]  Hold on. Well, we'll set this up right. We just had a moment. Okay, yeah, the guy,
[15075.63s -> 15081.07s]  the Geico Gecko is a real person. Yeah, look, he's a real guy. Geico, he's a, he's a real,
[15081.07s -> 15085.23s]  look, oh, he's behind the scenes. He's a real guy. He's a real person talking into the camera.
[15085.23s -> 15105.50s]  Okay, cool. It's me, but no one's looking for you. Okay, hold on. Okay, what was the right one you
[15105.50s -> 15116.96s]  set up was? The left. Jesse. This one here. And what's the best one? Probably this one here,
[15116.96s -> 15146.94s]  right? Is there a better one? The one below it? I wish, I wish I could, wait, hold on.
[15146.94s -> 15161.55s]  The one that was next to it? This one here. Okay, so what color should I make it? Is that all right?
[15161.55s -> 15177.52s]  The Vanster? What color? The default or this one? This brown color, right? Let me put a filter on
[15177.52s -> 15223.34s]  this too, like an orange filter, right? I need yellow. Kind of hard to do. The hue shift is,
[15223.34s -> 15235.89s]  like, gonna be really weird looking. I think that's okay. Unless I, can I add? I'm not sure
[15235.89s -> 15250.22s]  there's any filter I can add to this to make it, oh, hold on, there we go. Okay, color corrector.
[15250.22s -> 15258.24s]  Yeah, it's gonna be hard to do. Make a transparent layer. How does this look in the actual game?
[15258.24s -> 15268.66s]  I mean, that's, I don't know, that's pretty close. That could be it. That's not that bad.
[15268.66s -> 15296.13s]  Up to saturation? This just looks like an iPad game. It looks like a cartoon. Hold on,
[15296.13s -> 15323.31s]  it's getting better. Better? Fortnite map. It does look like a Fortnite. All right, that's good.
[15323.31s -> 15350.90s]  Okay, here we go. Less red and less blue. Guys, I can't do color correction on this. It doesn't
[15350.90s -> 15359.02s]  like it. It doesn't want me to. Wait, hold on. Um, be careful. This might hurt your eyes. I would
[15359.02s -> 15368.72s]  say just, just maybe, hold on, let me make sure it doesn't, it's gonna be bad. Um, this actually
[15368.72s -> 15393.20s]  might be like annoying to look at, so just be aware of that. I'm serious. All right, that's
[15393.20s -> 15426.66s]  looking pretty close. More yellow? Okay, that's definitely it. That's 100% right. Okay, here you
[15426.66s -> 15443.38s]  go. You ready? It's time for the latest episode of Breaking Bad. It's me. Oh, shit. What am I,
[15443.38s -> 15460.21s]  stupid?
[15465.01s -> 15477.63s]  Fuck. Spawn cops. Okay, hold on.
[15500.70s -> 15504.86s]  If you're planning on giving me some bullwinder about getting right with Jesus
[15505.50s -> 15508.78s]  or turning myself in. Not really. High school was a long time ago.
[15509.50s -> 15517.47s]  Yeah, you ain't welcome back cars. Step off. No speeches. Short speech. You lost your partner
[15517.47s -> 15525.02s]  today. Where are the police? Emilio? Where are the police? Where are the police? What was that?
[15525.02s -> 15535.33s]  Where are the police? I spawned them. They don't fucking exist. Hold on. Where are the police?
[15535.81s -> 15549.26s]  All right, I'm gonna turn traffic off. This is the last thing I'm doing before I'm out of here.
[15549.26s -> 15564.27s]  Okay, AI. Traffic. Remove traffic. I'm gonna stay on the road. Okay, traffic is off. Spawn police.
[15564.27s -> 15574.08s]  And then chase me, right? Oh my god, that's a lot. What the fuck? That's so many. Okay, now
[15574.72s -> 15578.35s]  come get me. You guys ready? Here we go. Here it comes. Here it is.
[15600.86s -> 15613.10s]  Square one, but you know the business and I know the chemistry. I'm thinking
[15614.75s -> 15643.65s]  maybe you and I could partner up on a good crystal mat. You, you and uh and me. Either that
[15645.18s -> 15663.18s]  or I turn you in. This is fucking stupid. This is fucking dumb, man. This is dumb.
[15663.82s -> 15680.98s]  This wasn't even close to being as funny as the other one. Mr. White. I was trying to just go off
[15680.98s -> 15687.84s]  a cliff. I was trying just to drive off a cliff. I was just peddled to the mat. All right, I'm done.
[15688.48s -> 15694.78s]  Turn all these filters off. This looks like shit. Please don't sue me and don't fucking remove my
[15694.78s -> 15701.90s]  stream. Turn this off before I hurt anybody else's eyes. They come to watch the stream. Look at how
[15701.90s -> 15709.01s]  much nicer that looks. All right, I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go. My head hurts. My fucking brain hurts.
[15709.89s -> 15719.18s]  This is so loud. Well, that was really funny. I successfully evaded the police. Okay, well that's
[15719.18s -> 15729.26s]  good to know. Throw out the car. All right, I will see you guys. Um, what's today? Maybe tomorrow?
[15729.26s -> 15735.33s]  Yeah, I'll be- tomorrow's Wednesday. Let's go. Something's happening tomorrow. I thought, wait,
[15735.33s -> 15743.60s]  what's happening tomorrow? Something is happening tomorrow and I don't know what it is. Okay, well,
[15743.60s -> 15747.58s]  I don't know what it is but we're gonna do it on Thursday. I'll see you guys on Thursday. We're
[15747.58s -> 15758.05s]  gonna do, uh, what was it gonna be? What the hell was- what the hell was it gonna stream?
[15760.19s -> 15765.41s]  Oh, the new house flipper update. House flipper pets DLC came out. It looks actually really good.
[15765.41s -> 15772.42s]  We're gonna do house flipper pets on, um, Thursday and then this weekend, probably on
[15773.63s -> 15780.11s]  Saturday or Sunday, we'll do some horror stuff. So we'll- yeah, we'll go- do Tuesday, we'll do
[15780.11s -> 15788.18s]  Thursday, we'll do Saturday. Maybe Saturday, Sunday? These people are still trying to kill me. Thanks
[15788.18s -> 15792.26s]  for watching, as always, everybody. Let me just say goodbye to you properly, right? Thanks for
[15792.26s -> 15799.18s]  watching. That was really funny. Um, my brain just hurts so I- I gotta get out of here. I'll see you
[15799.18s -> 15806.66s]  on Thursday. House flipper pets and then we got murder house and blood wash to play. I might be
[15806.66s -> 15811.95s]  able to even do another one. That was probably only like an hour long. I'll see you soon. That
[15811.95s -> 15817.65s]  was a ton of fun. That was- this game's great. I- I've seen this game played a million times
[15817.65s -> 15825.82s]  but I just never bought it so here it is. Really good BeamNG. That's fantastic. So I'll see you
[15825.82s -> 15829.42s]  guys later. See you Thursday. Thanks for watching. Good night. Goodbye. Take care of yourselves.
[15829.42s -> 15845.09s]  Love you, mother. You know. See you soon. The stream was fucked up. Yeah, it was, wasn't it? But
[15845.09s -> 15850.58s]  I don't know. I think I had a lot of fun. I gotta exit the game. How do I get out of here?
[15850.58s -> 15861.38s]  I'm actually looking forward to the house flipper update. There's actually- there's tons of animals.
[15861.38s -> 15868.50s]  It's not just dogs and cats. I think there are birds, bunnies, gerbils. There's a ton of stuff.
[15868.50s -> 15884.62s]  I'm gonna have an entire huge pet family. There are turtles. What about Webbed? Webbed is just
[15884.62s -> 15891.74s]  gonna be one of those games that I sit in the back pocket or whenever I decide to play it. I promise
[15891.74s -> 15902.16s]  I am gonna play it at some point. Within the next 30 days. Or within the next two weeks. Is Webbed
[15902.16s -> 15908.43s]  gonna be the new Glover? Um, no I mean I played Glover. Everybody hated it. Everybody screamed at
[15908.43s -> 15924.72s]  me and told me to leave. Promises equal lies. I'm just a very excitable person so I will say
[15924.72s -> 15930.03s]  something that I really want to do. Like oh yeah that sounds amazing. That sounds like an incredible
[15930.03s -> 15934.90s]  idea. Then two or three weeks later when you go hey uh remember when you said that you said you
[15934.90s -> 15943.58s]  promised you were gonna play it. Oh oops. Bring back community content night. Like I said before
[15943.58s -> 15947.26s]  if I'm gonna bring back community content night I'm gonna want to do another batch of green screen
[15947.26s -> 15955.49s]  stuff. That's where it's the most fun for me. So that's when you'll know. If you hear me announce
[15955.49s -> 15967.62s]  in the next few weeks I'm going back in front of the screen. Then we'll do more. What about Bionicle?
[15968.26s -> 15976.05s]  I don't have the rights to stream Bionicle. I don't think I can get them. Public domain movies?
[15976.13s -> 15995.44s]  Yeah I still want to do that too. How about retrying Halo? Yeah I'm just not a Halo guy.
[15995.44s -> 16005.97s]  It's cool. What about the Switch sports game? That did come out. Yeah there's a lot of stuff.
[16006.85s -> 16018.18s]  There's a lot of stuff to play so we can put it in the backlog. All right guys I'll see you later.
[16018.18s -> 16022.42s]  See you Thursday. Thanks for watching. Good night. Goodbye. See you soon.
