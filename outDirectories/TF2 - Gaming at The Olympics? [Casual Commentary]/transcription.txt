[0.31s -> 14.53s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[14.53s -> 23.03s]  And tonight, gonna be playing as the soldier with the black box, the shotgun, and the escape plan to run away from all the bad minions.
[23.03s -> 27.03s]  Anyways, guys, today we're gonna talk about something that I was thinking about today.
[27.03s -> 31.03s]  Actually, I thought about it last night, and I brought it up to Burger Boy. I was at Burger Boy's house.
[31.53s -> 38.77s]  We were sitting there, eating McDonald's, late night McDonald's, and we were watching the Olympic Games presentation, the opening ceremony.
[38.77s -> 45.77s]  If you don't know what the opening ceremony is for the Olympics, the 2014 Sochi Olympic Games, it's the country that's ever hosting it, whoever it is.
[45.77s -> 49.77s]  If it's Russia, United States, UK, and wherever it is.
[49.77s -> 57.27s]  They do this elaborate presentation where like, oh, Abraham Lincoln comes out with three women on his arms, and they sing the national anthem.
[57.27s -> 63.57s]  Like, they do this crazy presentation, and that's what we were watching. But forget about that. Forget I even said that. That's completely irrelevant.
[63.57s -> 72.05s]  It's about the Olympics, though, and how I think there's been talk about this before, right? I'm not the first person to bring this up.
[72.05s -> 80.59s]  But gaming at the Olympics, at least the Winter Olympics, because the Winter Olympics can promote a more indoor atmosphere,
[80.59s -> 87.59s]  because the Summer Olympics, as we all know, it's beach volleyball, it's swimming, it's all the cool, sunny outdoor activities,
[87.59s -> 92.09s]  where gaming's kind of just, we're all inside on a bunch of computers. But that's cool.
[92.09s -> 95.27s]  And I love the Winter Olympics. I love the Olympics.
[95.27s -> 100.77s]  It interests me the amount of things that some of these athletes can do with their triple axels and their,
[100.77s -> 108.27s]  oh my God, did you see that Ukrainian woman? She fell on her ass. And the American woman, like, threw up in the back room and it's on TV.
[108.27s -> 113.14s]  That type of stuff, that real drama, is really interesting to watch.
[113.14s -> 118.64s]  I feel the same way about watching football or basketball or baseball or any of those sports.
[118.64s -> 126.64s]  Any competitive event is awesome. Because you can just, I can just sit back in my chair and have like a bag of fucking Doritos on my stomach
[126.64s -> 132.14s]  and watch these people do these incredible feats of human strength and mental ability.
[132.14s -> 139.14s]  And I'm just sitting there like, oh yeah, that was, that was really cool. I wish I could do that.
[139.64s -> 149.92s]  And I, that's fine for me. And I think if gaming were allowed into the Olympics, and I'm not just talking about video games,
[149.92s -> 154.92s]  I'm not just talking about playing like League of Legends in a tournament versus, you know,
[154.92s -> 158.42s]  Germany versus France or something for one of the competitions during the Olympics.
[158.42s -> 165.22s]  I'm talking about board games too. We're talking chess. We're talking checkers. We're talking Monopoly.
[165.22s -> 170.22s]  No, no, no. I'm just kidding. I'm not talking. Monopoly would be like fucking stupid in the Olympics.
[170.22s -> 176.39s]  Like, I'm talking about the mental awareness games, the ones that are really directly one-to-one competitive with people.
[176.39s -> 182.39s]  And there are a lot of board games, guys, that you and I have never even heard of that are very competitive,
[182.39s -> 189.39s]  very directly involved with a 1v1 or 2v2 situation. And can you imagine watching something like that
[189.39s -> 195.13s]  when there were gold medals on the line? And you bring that in alongside of video games?
[195.13s -> 200.37s]  I think you can spice up these Winter Olympics like crazy, because think of how many people actually watch
[200.37s -> 206.37s]  the tournaments for some of these video games. Now, I don't know if there's any real televised chess tournaments anymore.
[206.37s -> 209.37s]  I'm sure there are, and I'm sure there's a lot of places where you can go watch them.
[209.37s -> 213.87s]  If you really wanted to, there's probably a chess site that has all kinds of stuff like that.
[213.87s -> 217.37s]  But League of Legends. I'm going to use League of Legends as a complete example here.
[217.37s -> 222.80s]  Now, I don't play League of Legends. I don't really follow League of Legends, really at all.
[222.80s -> 228.80s]  But when I see something like this, it's pretty ridiculous and it really piques my interest into other things,
[228.80s -> 235.23s]  like talking about the Olympics. 32 million people watched the tournament, the championship game
[235.23s -> 240.54s]  of that 2013 League of Legends tournament championship series. 32 million people.
[240.54s -> 247.21s]  How many people watched, like, the biathlon from the 2010 Winter Olympics? I don't know.
[247.21s -> 252.21s]  But if for some reason that number is insanely huge, if you come to me the comments section right now and you're like,
[252.21s -> 256.21s]  Hey, Jerma, the archery championship had 65 billion people watched.
[256.21s -> 263.51s]  Then obviously I would retract what I'm about to say. If a game like League of Legends can pull in that type of audience,
[263.51s -> 270.88s]  why shouldn't it be in something like the Olympics when eSports and when competitive gaming is getting more and more and more backing
[270.88s -> 277.12s]  and more and more and more support and more people that care than ever before?
[277.12s -> 282.12s]  I think we would see so many cool things if the Olympic Games allowed gaming.
[282.12s -> 290.49s]  Now obviously the main drawback to this whole argument, this whole theory, is there are a lot of different video games.
[290.49s -> 295.49s]  There are a lot of different, quote, games out there. Which ones would qualify?
[295.49s -> 300.49s]  And which ones are the ones that actually are very competitive, that deserve gold medals?
[300.49s -> 304.49s]  And that's not for me to decide. It's just something I was throwing on the table.
[304.49s -> 309.49s]  So if you're like a video game theory physicist and you can come up with those ideas,
[309.49s -> 313.86s]  and maybe in like five years or ten years or twenty years, however long it takes,
[313.86s -> 317.86s]  and if it ever happens, if it never happens, then you know, whatever.
[317.86s -> 321.86s]  But it's interesting to think about. I want to know what you guys have to say about this.
[321.86s -> 324.86s]  Leave a comment if you'd like to below discussing this further.
[324.86s -> 327.03s]  And I'll see you guys all next time. That's gonna wrap up the video.
[327.03s -> 330.03s]  Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[330.03s -> 334.51s]  And I'll see you guys all next time. And of course, take care, everybody.
