[59.90s -> 69.59s]  I am Beck. I don't know if Ster is Beck. Can you change this? What should I make this?
[69.59s -> 77.82s]  Like a cooking class. Cooking class with Ster. Hey, what's your what's your title?
[77.82s -> 87.35s]  Because I want it to be different than yours. My title is, do you still talk to Jerma?
[87.35s -> 89.11s]  I get that question a lot so I just put in my title.
[90.07s -> 105.56s]  How about uh, how about should I just make mine Ster and I are talking?
[106.28s -> 109.56s]  Yeah, I think that'd be good. That'd be a good co-op title.
[112.90s -> 120.71s]  That's fair, right? Not bad, pretty good. Okay. And then this is played up, right?
[121.67s -> 125.03s]  Yeah, all one word apparently. One word. Yeah.
[128.71s -> 130.79s]  This has been on the whole time. I'm sorry everybody.
[130.79s -> 138.14s]  I am so ready to make a 2018 YouTube video. Are you? Wait up, let's go!
[138.14s -> 142.54s]  So invite, how do we, how do we, are you using a controller or a keyboard mouse?
[143.74s -> 153.40s]  I'd have to find a controller. I just did invite only. We don't know how to even play. Oh, hold on.
[153.40s -> 157.16s]  How do I like add, hold on, multiplayer. Oh, invite friends.
[160.31s -> 164.71s]  There's a Twitch integration and options where the customers are chatters, I think.
[166.07s -> 175.42s]  Uh, options, advanced, Twitch integration. Open Chef application which handles
[175.42s -> 179.26s]  Twitch integration, Twitch settings can be configured within Chef.
[179.26s -> 187.85s]  I don't know if you want to deal with that. Uh, this is asking a lot right now.
[187.85s -> 190.33s]  It is, it is asking a lot more than I thought it was.
[190.33s -> 194.33s]  Yeah, it's like, I got to like, okay, this is like, I have like a new window.
[195.53s -> 200.73s]  It's like a whole nother application. Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no, no. I'm sorry.
[200.73s -> 203.22s]  I haven't, guys, I haven't even played the game.
[203.22s -> 205.06s]  I don't know what my Twitch password is.
[207.38s -> 208.98s]  There's a lot of stuff, I don't know.
[208.98s -> 211.54s]  Well, maybe, maybe at some point later. We have to like figure out how to play,
[211.54s -> 215.48s]  join each other's games. Can you join off me?
[215.48s -> 219.10s]  Um. Let me see if I can just invite you.
[219.10s -> 226.04s]  I mean, are you hosting a game?
[226.04s -> 230.20s]  I am right now, but it says like, oh, invite only.
[230.20s -> 236.71s]  And it says invite friends. When I click it, nothing happens.
[236.71s -> 238.15s]  Are you even online on Steam?
[238.15s -> 238.71s]  Yeah.
[238.71s -> 245.78s]  Uh, your name is probably like Pancake Recipe or some shit.
[245.78s -> 246.34s]  It's, it's.
[246.34s -> 247.38s]  I got it, I got it, I got it.
[247.38s -> 249.38s]  It's German.
[249.38s -> 250.57s]  What?
[250.57s -> 251.13s]  It is.
[251.13s -> 256.78s]  But wasn't your name like Ice Cream Sandwich in the last game?
[256.78s -> 258.06s]  I mean, it was, maybe.
[259.37s -> 263.21s]  Wait, were you, were you paying someone to play that game with me?
[263.77s -> 265.69s]  And you were just reacting on camera?
[265.69s -> 267.90s]  It's just, it's the new meta.
[267.90s -> 272.58s]  All right, can you join the game or not?
[272.58s -> 276.34s]  I, I don't think I can. I don't see a like join.
[276.34s -> 279.13s]  How do we do this?
[279.13s -> 283.50s]  Because I can't, when I click invite, maybe I should do this.
[283.50s -> 285.02s]  Okay. Wait, no, I'm in the tutorial.
[285.02s -> 288.58s]  Oh goodness. Do the tutorial.
[288.58s -> 290.49s]  Okay.
[290.49s -> 315.53s]  That's a problem. God, what have I done?
[315.53s -> 318.01s]  Oh my God, I just exited this tutorial.
[318.01s -> 320.94s]  Shit. Um, okay, hold on.
[320.94s -> 325.59s]  Why can I not invite you?
[325.59s -> 330.44s]  Is my, okay, you make the game because my Steam overlay like is disabled.
[330.44s -> 331.88s]  Do I have to do the tutorial?
[331.88s -> 333.78s]  Because it has like a.
[333.78s -> 335.54s]  Try, try making an invite only.
[335.54s -> 337.46s]  Go to multiplayer, go to invite only and invite friends.
[337.46s -> 343.27s]  Because I don't, I think I do my, my Steam is off.
[343.27s -> 343.83s]  What?
[343.83s -> 346.36s]  Like my Steam integration is like fucked up.
[346.36s -> 348.68s]  I can't, when I click invite friends and nothing happens.
[348.68s -> 352.87s]  Okay. This is also going to need a controller because the interact key is P.
[355.27s -> 356.39s]  I am using a controller.
[356.39s -> 360.26s]  Oh, hold on. I'm going to find a controller real quick.
[360.26s -> 361.22s]  Oh, no.
[362.10s -> 364.02s]  We could have just, I was enjoying Ember.
[364.02s -> 369.37s]  I'm sorry that you played it for like four hours with me and didn't enjoy it for a moment.
[369.37s -> 371.02s]  I did.
[371.02s -> 378.60s]  We invite only was broken for me.
[378.60s -> 379.48s]  Try something else.
[379.48s -> 386.12s]  Really? For real?
[386.12s -> 396.70s]  Okay. Can you join off me now?
[396.70s -> 398.86s]  I can look, I was looking for a controller.
[398.86s -> 409.78s]  So this is broken. Somebody said in chat.
[409.78s -> 411.46s]  Oh, you can just leave the tutorial.
[411.46s -> 412.42s]  Yeah. That's what I did.
[412.42s -> 415.06s]  But that means we're not going to know how to play the game.
[415.06s -> 416.57s]  Yeah, we will.
[416.57s -> 421.67s]  Okay. I have it set to private.
[421.67s -> 422.79s]  So I wonder if you can just join me.
[422.79s -> 429.46s]  I'm trying.
[429.46s -> 432.04s]  There's a built-in invite.
[432.04s -> 434.12s]  Yeah. I'm trying to do it.
[434.12s -> 434.92s]  I did what you did.
[434.92s -> 435.96s]  I couldn't get out of that.
[437.24s -> 438.12s]  I did quit game.
[438.84s -> 439.56s]  Calm down.
[439.56s -> 440.76s]  There was nothing else to do.
[440.76s -> 441.72s]  Okay. Just relax.
[442.76s -> 443.80s]  I'm relaxed.
[443.80s -> 444.54s]  Maybe do that.
[444.54s -> 448.76s]  I'm relaxed.
[448.76s -> 453.40s]  Go into your menu, but go and just like see if you can join off of me from your Steam.
[453.40s -> 457.70s]  It's okay.
[457.70s -> 458.74s]  Multiplayer.
[458.74s -> 459.78s]  Multiplayer.
[459.78s -> 461.54s]  And just see if you can just join my game.
[462.10s -> 468.10s]  No, there's only like, hold on.
[468.10s -> 469.70s]  Well, you broke it.
[469.70s -> 470.26s]  I broke it.
[470.26s -> 472.74s]  I can't even right click your name on Steam right now.
[472.74s -> 473.94s]  Something's wrong.
[473.94s -> 474.42s]  What's today?
[475.62s -> 476.34s]  What's today?
[476.34s -> 476.98s]  Maintenance?
[476.98s -> 481.21s]  It's Monday.
[481.21s -> 482.65s]  My whole Steam friends list.
[482.65s -> 484.09s]  I can't click any of it.
[484.09s -> 490.10s]  Restart your computer.
[490.10s -> 492.20s]  I'm not doing that.
[492.20s -> 494.44s]  You need to invite through the plate up options.
[494.44s -> 497.98s]  The Steam overlay does not work.
[498.70s -> 501.11s]  Yeah, I'm in the plate up options.
[501.11s -> 503.83s]  Multiplayer and invite friends doesn't work.
[503.83s -> 504.63s]  I can't click it.
[504.63s -> 508.33s]  When I click it, it just goes, yeah, I'll show you.
[508.33s -> 515.74s]  I'll show you my black screen.
[515.74s -> 517.82s]  I don't know, just in case it's like a lobby code or something.
[517.82s -> 523.21s]  I don't know.
[523.21s -> 525.21s]  Yeah, I sent an invite to you.
[525.21s -> 525.77s]  You did.
[525.77s -> 527.99s]  I believe I did.
[527.99s -> 528.63s]  Did you?
[528.63s -> 531.40s]  You did.
[531.40s -> 532.60s]  Okay, play game.
[532.60s -> 533.18s]  All right.
[533.18s -> 534.78s]  Do you have it on private?
[534.78s -> 537.96s]  I think so.
[537.96s -> 538.44s]  Okay.
[538.44s -> 539.64s]  Am I in your game?
[539.64s -> 542.12s]  Joining.
[542.12s -> 543.61s]  Yeah, you've joined.
[543.61s -> 543.93s]  All right.
[543.93s -> 544.57s]  All right.
[544.57s -> 545.61s]  Now, everybody.
[545.61s -> 546.33s]  Hold on.
[546.33s -> 549.35s]  I have to capture the video feed.
[549.35s -> 566.97s]  Okay, so should we do the tutorial?
[566.97s -> 568.25s]  Yeah, the buttons for this game.
[568.25s -> 573.37s]  I couldn't find a controller and the buttons seem insane.
[573.37s -> 576.42s]  Oh, do you want to play the tutorial?
[576.42s -> 576.90s]  Yes.
[576.90s -> 584.50s]  Let's grab while looking at the fish to take the fish.
[584.50s -> 587.06s]  Place the fish.
[587.06s -> 588.42s]  Stop touching things.
[588.42s -> 598.58s]  Well, place the fish on the hob to start cooking.
[598.58s -> 604.63s]  Oh, combine the fish with the plate.
[604.63s -> 611.40s]  Once a customer has arrived and chosen their meal,
[611.40s -> 612.76s]  interact to take their order.
[612.84s -> 616.07s]  Okay, so there's no customer.
[616.07s -> 621.67s]  You can now see their order above their head.
[621.67s -> 622.79s]  Place it on their table.
[622.79s -> 626.42s]  They want a blank plate.
[626.42s -> 629.38s]  Oh, why wasn't it looking?
[629.38s -> 631.30s]  Yeah, I looked at it that way too.
[631.30s -> 632.26s]  I just want a plate.
[632.26s -> 635.24s]  Yeah, like I'm not hungry.
[635.24s -> 637.16s]  Customers won't sit at the table with something on it.
[637.16s -> 639.00s]  Once they leave, grab the dirty plate.
[639.00s -> 641.70s]  Put it in the sink.
[641.70s -> 646.09s]  I had a question before we continue any further.
[646.65s -> 650.42s]  So when you're streaming and you go to the bathroom,
[650.42s -> 654.10s]  are you not trying to finish the bathroom as quickly as possible
[654.10s -> 655.54s]  or like are you in your sanctuary
[655.54s -> 657.62s]  and you're like on your phone watching a stream
[657.62s -> 660.42s]  while your stream is live waiting for you to come back?
[660.42s -> 661.62s]  Well, here's the thing.
[661.62s -> 668.34s]  I have never taken a shit in the middle of a stream ever.
[668.34s -> 672.18s]  Not one time the entire time I've ever been on Twitch.
[672.18s -> 674.42s]  So you would just end the stream before you would do that?
[674.42s -> 677.85s]  Yes, I would either go to the bathroom before or after.
[677.85s -> 679.05s]  I would never do it during a stream
[679.05s -> 684.39s]  because it would take way too long.
[684.39s -> 685.03s]  And plus, I don't know.
[686.31s -> 690.78s]  Look, when you're sitting there and you're taking a shit,
[691.74s -> 693.18s]  isn't it in your mind you're just thinking
[693.18s -> 696.50s]  about all the people that are leaving your stream?
[696.50s -> 700.22s]  It's like, dude, it's been like 10 minutes.
[700.22s -> 701.10s]  Where is this guy?
[701.10s -> 701.82s]  I'm out of here.
[701.82s -> 702.62s]  And I'm just sitting there.
[702.62s -> 704.38s]  I'd be kind of panicking.
[704.38s -> 706.38s]  Yeah, but it's got to happen sometimes.
[706.38s -> 708.34s]  It's never happened.
[710.71s -> 712.07s]  People always ask why I'm late
[712.07s -> 715.19s]  or why streams start so late or, oh, dude, you said two,
[715.19s -> 717.67s]  but then you said three because I need to make sure
[717.67s -> 722.15s]  that all liquids and solids are out of my body completely
[722.15s -> 725.13s]  before I turn the stream on.
[725.13s -> 727.85s]  Empty, zero, empty, empty, empty.
[727.85s -> 730.52s]  That's a rough life.
[730.52s -> 731.40s]  Wow, why?
[731.40s -> 732.44s]  Because I don't want to have to do that
[732.44s -> 733.24s]  in the middle of the stream?
[734.42s -> 736.26s]  Like everybody else in their jobs,
[736.26s -> 739.86s]  they get to go to the bathroom.
[739.86s -> 742.58s]  It's not like you're allowed to go to the bathroom.
[742.58s -> 746.02s]  But I know how my bathroom habits are.
[746.02s -> 749.62s]  And even if I hurry, it will be 15 to 20 minutes.
[749.62s -> 752.98s]  How do I cut?
[752.98s -> 762.79s]  Oh, fries.
[762.79s -> 767.70s]  Do you chug coffee like beforehand?
[767.70s -> 770.17s]  Yes, I drink coffee all the time.
[770.17s -> 772.30s]  Get him his fries.
[772.30s -> 776.54s]  He wants fish and fries.
[776.54s -> 787.59s]  I got a heart.
[791.56s -> 792.84s]  Place a plate in a sink.
[792.84s -> 793.40s]  Oh, I can't.
[793.40s -> 795.96s]  Why not?
[795.96s -> 797.96s]  Oh, we have to wash the dish and then get it out.
[797.96s -> 804.62s]  These sound effects are kind of loud and annoying for me.
[804.62s -> 805.78s]  Are they for you?
[805.78s -> 806.42s]  A little bit.
[806.42s -> 807.62s]  You can, there's always like a,
[807.62s -> 809.22s]  you know, you can lower the volume or.
[809.22s -> 816.60s]  Yeah, let me do that.
[816.60s -> 818.68s]  Groups expect all their meals to arrive together.
[818.68s -> 820.12s]  When they're ready, take their order.
[820.12s -> 822.81s]  You got it.
[822.81s -> 823.93s]  Oh, you got it.
[823.93s -> 830.06s]  Oh, I wonder what they're going to want.
[830.06s -> 831.58s]  A fish or a French fry?
[833.35s -> 834.15s]  Oh, you baste.
[838.58s -> 845.58s]  Oh, wait, you didn't want fries.
[845.58s -> 852.12s]  Why, these are on the house.
[852.12s -> 854.68s]  Survive as many days as possible.
[854.68s -> 860.12s]  Okay, that's pretty, that's pretty hardcore.
[860.12s -> 864.06s]  If a patient's bar runs up.
[864.06s -> 865.42s]  Okay, we know what to do.
[865.42s -> 866.86s]  Why are you minus twoing me?
[866.86s -> 869.18s]  We can't get one bad review on Yelp.
[869.18s -> 874.60s]  And you should be striving for that as a business.
[874.60s -> 876.76s]  What would you guys rate my stream?
[876.76s -> 883.19s]  Oh, let's get a poll up between one and five.
[883.19s -> 886.55s]  You made a bad joke.
[886.55s -> 887.35s]  I didn't make a joke.
[887.35s -> 888.63s]  I just said a word.
[888.63s -> 899.32s]  I said one word.
[899.32s -> 900.12s]  All right, take this order.
[904.55s -> 906.95s]  And that's somebody's to sit there with a cooked fish.
[907.03s -> 909.03s]  It's like, so what are you going to order tonight?
[909.03s -> 910.36s]  Like, I don't know.
[910.36s -> 911.72s]  I was thinking about the soup.
[911.72s -> 912.36s]  Oh, the soup, huh?
[912.36s -> 914.50s]  What about this thing?
[914.50s -> 918.97s]  You think this looks good?
[918.97s -> 922.42s]  Okay, so we need to take a portion of mashed potatoes.
[922.42s -> 936.60s]  Oh, we can buy stuff too.
[936.60s -> 938.04s]  How many days do we make it?
[938.04s -> 941.74s]  I think we make it to day two.
[941.74s -> 946.25s]  Five.
[946.25s -> 947.13s]  Okay, cool.
[947.13s -> 948.95s]  Five.
[948.95s -> 950.07s]  What's the name of a restaurant?
[961.14s -> 963.29s]  Oil and Char.
[963.29s -> 965.53s]  Oil and that sounds disgusting.
[965.53s -> 972.34s]  How do we start?
[972.34s -> 975.91s]  Complete the plan to begin.
[975.91s -> 977.59s]  Okay, so we need to go to the city.
[977.59s -> 979.35s]  Oh.
[979.35s -> 980.47s]  Put the floor plan there.
[980.47s -> 981.93s]  Okay.
[982.57s -> 984.41s]  And then the menu is steak.
[984.41s -> 986.14s]  We have steak.
[986.14s -> 987.74s]  Okay, add oil and char.
[987.74s -> 988.78s]  Oil and char.
[988.78s -> 995.13s]  I think you have to get over here.
[995.13s -> 1001.11s]  Yeah, I don't know if we're getting day two.
[1001.11s -> 1002.15s]  I think we get to day three.
[1002.15s -> 1009.29s]  Cook steak once for rare, twice for medium, and three times for well done.
[1010.49s -> 1014.71s]  What is happening?
[1014.71s -> 1016.23s]  Why are we losing progress?
[1016.79s -> 1019.77s]  All right, here we go.
[1019.77s -> 1022.17s]  Okay, we need rolls, rolls.
[1022.17s -> 1024.68s]  Behind the counter, start cooking a steak.
[1024.68s -> 1025.32s]  I'll take the orders.
[1025.32s -> 1026.12s]  You take the orders.
[1026.12s -> 1027.16s]  I will take the orders.
[1027.16s -> 1028.28s]  You start the food.
[1028.28s -> 1029.56s]  Don't move the fridge.
[1029.56s -> 1032.20s]  I just start day.
[1032.20s -> 1033.24s]  We press K.
[1033.24s -> 1035.10s]  Okay, are we ready?
[1035.10s -> 1035.82s]  It's why?
[1035.82s -> 1037.02s]  I thought you had a controller.
[1037.02s -> 1039.22s]  No, I don't.
[1039.22s -> 1042.68s]  That's tough times, dude.
[1042.68s -> 1042.92s]  Okay.
[1042.92s -> 1044.09s]  Are you ready?
[1044.09s -> 1044.97s]  I'm ready.
[1044.97s -> 1046.49s]  But the name of the restaurant is High Steaks.
[1047.96s -> 1049.08s]  The first level.
[1049.08s -> 1051.16s]  It's going to be like three people are going to come in.
[1052.68s -> 1054.52s]  All right, so why am I taking orders?
[1054.52s -> 1055.32s]  They're going to want a steak.
[1055.32s -> 1056.68s]  That's it.
[1056.68s -> 1058.17s]  Okay, what would you like?
[1058.17s -> 1059.21s]  I would like a steak.
[1059.21s -> 1060.01s]  Oh, I wonder.
[1060.01s -> 1060.25s]  Okay.
[1063.72s -> 1064.52s]  What do you want to done this?
[1065.24s -> 1066.12s]  Okay, that's what they want.
[1066.12s -> 1066.68s]  They want it like that.
[1066.68s -> 1067.32s]  Take it off.
[1068.12s -> 1068.76s]  Get it.
[1068.76s -> 1069.48s]  Go, go, go, go.
[1071.35s -> 1071.75s]  You are.
[1073.54s -> 1074.58s]  Hey, you can't stand the heat
[1074.58s -> 1075.70s]  and you better stay out of the kitchen.
[1075.70s -> 1076.34s]  Clean that up.
[1076.34s -> 1078.18s]  I told you this is going to be so easy.
[1078.18s -> 1080.10s]  Clean that up, you little baby busboy.
[1084.01s -> 1086.57s]  Yeah, you got to earn a position.
[1086.57s -> 1089.21s]  How much water did you just knock on the floor?
[1089.21s -> 1089.61s]  I didn't.
[1090.33s -> 1091.45s]  All right, what do you want?
[1091.45s -> 1092.25s]  Let me guess.
[1092.25s -> 1093.29s]  Oh, they want a...
[1093.29s -> 1094.25s]  I think that's well done.
[1094.81s -> 1096.17s]  You already have one halfway there.
[1097.13s -> 1098.01s]  Wait, what is this?
[1099.56s -> 1101.56s]  Oh, that's just a bonus one.
[1101.56s -> 1102.60s]  Here, I got them.
[1102.76s -> 1103.40s]  How do you clean?
[1112.95s -> 1113.35s]  Oh, okay.
[1113.35s -> 1114.95s]  You have to hold X to clean.
[1116.97s -> 1118.09s]  I don't see you doing anything.
[1119.05s -> 1120.01s]  I was...
[1120.01s -> 1120.89s]  You're going to take his order?
[1123.03s -> 1123.99s]  We don't even need to.
[1123.99s -> 1124.71s]  We know what it is.
[1125.69s -> 1126.65s]  Is it going to be steak?
[1126.65s -> 1128.73s]  It's a medium and a well done steak.
[1131.27s -> 1133.48s]  This one needs to go back around.
[1133.48s -> 1134.92s]  You can't because it's already on the plate.
[1134.92s -> 1135.42s]  What?
[1139.59s -> 1140.31s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[1140.31s -> 1140.71s]  Take it off.
[1140.71s -> 1141.21s]  Take it off.
[1142.81s -> 1143.69s]  Go.
[1143.69s -> 1144.25s]  Here you are.
[1145.05s -> 1147.13s]  Ah, bon appetit.
[1147.13s -> 1148.44s]  Steak.
[1148.98s -> 1153.58s]  All right, Scott wants the steak.
[1155.22s -> 1159.83s]  Take that one off.
[1159.83s -> 1160.55s]  Take that one off.
[1160.55s -> 1161.19s]  Take that one off.
[1161.75s -> 1163.14s]  This one's burnt.
[1163.94s -> 1164.82s]  I'm cleaning.
[1165.62s -> 1173.38s]  The plates go back in the rack.
[1173.38s -> 1176.82s]  You're an idiot sandwich.
[1179.46s -> 1180.34s]  Oh, no.
[1180.34s -> 1181.30s]  What have you done?
[1181.30s -> 1181.78s]  What are you doing?
[1181.78s -> 1182.58s]  Well, we did it.
[1182.58s -> 1183.14s]  We won.
[1183.14s -> 1184.58s]  What do you mean, what am I doing?
[1184.58s -> 1185.14s]  Stop it.
[1185.14s -> 1185.70s]  Stop.
[1185.70s -> 1186.82s]  Oh, disgusting.
[1186.82s -> 1187.46s]  What are you doing?
[1188.10s -> 1188.82s]  No, stop.
[1189.38s -> 1190.90s]  It's fucking raw, mate.
[1190.90s -> 1192.26s]  It's bloody fucking raw.
[1193.06s -> 1196.39s]  Have you ever seen Gordon Ramsay's TikTok food reviews?
[1197.42s -> 1197.98s]  Uh, no.
[1198.78s -> 1200.33s]  Wait, what are these?
[1205.03s -> 1205.91s]  What's happening?
[1205.91s -> 1206.87s]  We rerolled.
[1207.91s -> 1213.26s]  Upgrade a blueprint?
[1213.26s -> 1214.22s]  What the?
[1214.22s -> 1215.34s]  We don't have enough money.
[1215.34s -> 1217.66s]  We only got 28 money, so it doesn't even matter.
[1217.66s -> 1218.54s]  They just give you one?
[1218.54s -> 1220.78s]  Wait, what are these little, these bouncing?
[1224.47s -> 1226.31s]  I think these are upgrades.
[1226.31s -> 1230.44s]  Okay, I understand.
[1230.44s -> 1232.20s]  Then you like interact, hold up.
[1232.20s -> 1235.85s]  That one's like hidden.
[1235.85s -> 1238.33s]  Oh, we can rearrange our kitchen even.
[1238.89s -> 1240.30s]  What is it?
[1240.30s -> 1241.66s]  Oh, okay, I see.
[1241.66s -> 1244.07s]  So what do we do?
[1244.07s -> 1248.47s]  Do we just pick them up and they just get stored somewhere?
[1248.47s -> 1249.91s]  Why don't we just put this in?
[1249.91s -> 1251.35s]  Why don't we just put all this shit out here?
[1254.63s -> 1255.59s]  You can't do that.
[1255.59s -> 1256.31s]  Why not?
[1256.31s -> 1257.27s]  I don't understand why not.
[1257.27s -> 1258.47s]  We're doing hibachi grill?
[1258.47s -> 1259.03s]  What's the?
[1259.03s -> 1260.31s]  Hibachi steak.
[1260.95s -> 1261.59s]  Yeah, sure.
[1261.59s -> 1266.31s]  Okay, let's rearrange.
[1266.31s -> 1267.91s]  I don't understand why we would not want to be
[1267.91s -> 1270.79s]  like two or three steps closer to the seats.
[1270.79s -> 1273.75s]  Uh, sure, you know, you bring up a really valid point.
[1273.75s -> 1278.31s]  You want to make this, um, sufficient, then that's what we can do.
[1278.31s -> 1284.82s]  And the storage will just be in here.
[1284.82s -> 1286.76s]  Research, yes.
[1286.76s -> 1289.64s]  I feel like we had, we had good flow on.
[1290.58s -> 1293.86s]  What is this heat sign that is next to these tables?
[1293.86s -> 1296.90s]  I think it's just decreased patience.
[1297.62s -> 1300.02s]  I think today they don't have a lot of patience.
[1300.02s -> 1304.06s]  That's like prepare for this because people have really
[1304.06s -> 1305.26s]  want their food quick today.
[1305.26s -> 1310.20s]  And you just took a seat away from that.
[1310.20s -> 1312.07s]  Okay, you ready?
[1312.07s -> 1313.35s]  I wait, hold on, hold on.
[1313.35s -> 1314.23s]  We can buy one of these.
[1315.03s -> 1316.39s]  What's the work boots?
[1316.39s -> 1319.46s]  We can buy an extra sink.
[1319.46s -> 1320.50s]  Okay, we don't want none of this.
[1321.50s -> 1324.30s]  Unless you want an extra dining table for more people.
[1324.30s -> 1325.10s]  We can buy that.
[1325.10s -> 1326.14s]  Well, we're in level two.
[1326.14s -> 1326.78s]  It's not gonna happen.
[1326.78s -> 1327.18s]  Okay.
[1327.18s -> 1327.98s]  Yeah, okay, let's start.
[1328.70s -> 1329.18s]  Start day.
[1329.74s -> 1332.28s]  Yep.
[1332.28s -> 1334.12s]  I remember if we lose one day, we die.
[1334.92s -> 1336.92s]  They actually pull us out back and execute us.
[1337.64s -> 1340.25s]  Just get some food going.
[1343.06s -> 1346.50s]  Okay, we got one, that one and then one well.
[1347.30s -> 1348.34s]  Why did you take that one off?
[1348.90s -> 1350.74s]  Because that wait for that one to be well and then we're good.
[1351.78s -> 1352.33s]  Okay.
[1352.33s -> 1353.05s]  On the plate.
[1353.05s -> 1353.53s]  Let it up.
[1354.17s -> 1357.94s]  There it is.
[1357.94s -> 1358.90s]  10 bucks.
[1358.90s -> 1364.20s]  Okay, clean this ship all the way in the other room.
[1364.76s -> 1366.28s]  That's fine.
[1366.28s -> 1367.40s]  All right, I will take care of this.
[1367.40s -> 1369.24s]  You, you, I will do this.
[1369.24s -> 1369.88s]  Just go and leave.
[1378.39s -> 1381.19s]  This is like nothing's happening yet and it's already stressful.
[1385.32s -> 1385.80s]  Behind.
[1387.30s -> 1388.90s]  Get that, get that off, get that off.
[1390.50s -> 1398.10s]  Wait, two more on the grill.
[1398.10s -> 1399.06s]  Two more on the grill.
[1399.06s -> 1399.86s]  I'm cleaning.
[1400.50s -> 1402.68s]  Two more on the grill.
[1402.68s -> 1403.80s]  Okay, wait, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[1403.80s -> 1405.48s]  Let's like farm these guys.
[1405.48s -> 1406.52s]  What do you mean?
[1406.52s -> 1409.88s]  They don't need like we have plenty of time before we can take their order.
[1409.88s -> 1411.32s]  We don't know what they want for steaks.
[1411.32s -> 1411.80s]  Take them off.
[1411.80s -> 1412.76s]  We don't know what they want.
[1412.76s -> 1414.04s]  We don't know what they want for steaks.
[1414.68s -> 1415.80s]  This is two mediums.
[1416.90s -> 1418.18s]  You fucking donkey.
[1423.13s -> 1423.69s]  Get it off.
[1424.57s -> 1425.27s]  Let's go.
[1427.70s -> 1428.26s]  Oh my god.
[1428.26s -> 1428.74s]  Oh my god.
[1428.74s -> 1429.86s]  You fucking.
[1429.86s -> 1431.22s]  You put it on.
[1431.22s -> 1432.02s]  You put it on.
[1433.06s -> 1433.94s]  Just dance in front of them.
[1433.94s -> 1434.50s]  Dance quick.
[1434.50s -> 1435.22s]  Just distract them.
[1439.26s -> 1439.66s]  Oops.
[1441.10s -> 1441.90s]  Oh my god.
[1441.90s -> 1443.42s]  I can't believe you got that.
[1443.42s -> 1443.92s]  What?
[1444.98s -> 1446.02s]  Yeah, we fucked up, dude.
[1448.01s -> 1449.45s]  Actually, it looked like I don't know.
[1449.45s -> 1450.49s]  It was milliseconds.
[1455.24s -> 1456.60s]  Okay, so we're good.
[1457.16s -> 1457.80s]  Wait, we didn't?
[1459.16s -> 1460.60s]  No, it's restarting that day.
[1460.60s -> 1460.92s]  All right.
[1460.92s -> 1462.68s]  Well, that just didn't work.
[1465.42s -> 1467.58s]  I was hoping it would kick us back to the beginning.
[1469.80s -> 1473.40s]  I did not like the kitchen set up at all, by the way.
[1473.40s -> 1475.32s]  Someone was outside, you donkey.
[1476.04s -> 1477.85s]  What do we do about that?
[1477.85s -> 1479.96s]  Like, who cares?
[1482.07s -> 1485.37s]  So do we have a seed?
[1485.37s -> 1489.40s]  I believe so.
[1489.40s -> 1490.36s]  There's a seed.
[1490.44s -> 1491.32s]  That's interesting.
[1491.32s -> 1492.92s]  Get me to clear the table.
[1492.92s -> 1494.28s]  Oh, we needed to clear the table.
[1494.28s -> 1495.00s]  Okay.
[1495.00s -> 1502.55s]  This is a rogue light.
[1502.55s -> 1504.14s]  Okay.
[1504.14s -> 1504.46s]  What?
[1505.94s -> 1506.74s]  Okay, that's kind of cool.
[1506.74s -> 1507.30s]  All right, let's go.
[1508.49s -> 1510.41s]  That's why I was interested in this game because it's like,
[1510.41s -> 1514.25s]  it's not like the other games like Overcooked are all like individual puzzles.
[1514.25s -> 1516.86s]  This one was like, they murder you.
[1516.86s -> 1518.14s]  But didn't we just lose?
[1518.14s -> 1519.74s]  How come we were able to do it again?
[1519.74s -> 1521.06s]  I don't know.
[1523.34s -> 1525.56s]  Okay, well, let's go.
[1525.56s -> 1526.44s]  It's just stakes.
[1526.44s -> 1527.72s]  Just don't screw it up.
[1527.72s -> 1529.86s]  We just have to not be idiots.
[1529.86s -> 1530.90s]  Oh, it's after three days.
[1530.90s -> 1531.78s]  Okay, the first three days.
[1532.42s -> 1534.10s]  Oh, the first three days are free.
[1534.10s -> 1534.34s]  Yeah.
[1534.34s -> 1534.82s]  Okay.
[1534.82s -> 1535.38s]  All right, let's go.
[1535.38s -> 1536.02s]  So you're ready?
[1536.02s -> 1536.74s]  Okay.
[1536.74s -> 1538.66s]  All right, we need to have actual roles.
[1538.66s -> 1543.69s]  I will be the cleaner and I'll get the plates.
[1543.69s -> 1544.49s]  I'll do the cleaning.
[1544.49s -> 1545.37s]  I'll clean up the ground.
[1545.93s -> 1549.93s]  You handle the meat because same thing will happen like last time.
[1549.93s -> 1551.29s]  I'll put one on when you scream it at me.
[1551.85s -> 1552.73s]  Okay, take the rotor.
[1553.29s -> 1555.37s]  Okay, with that, we need one well, one medium.
[1556.09s -> 1561.27s]  Exactly.
[1561.27s -> 1562.15s]  Perfect.
[1562.15s -> 1563.19s]  Get out of the doorway.
[1563.75s -> 1564.79s]  Let me deliver it.
[1565.75s -> 1567.19s]  Let me deliver it.
[1567.19s -> 1567.59s]  All right.
[1567.59s -> 1569.11s]  Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[1569.11s -> 1569.51s]  You're right.
[1569.51s -> 1569.75s]  You're right.
[1569.75s -> 1570.15s]  You're right.
[1570.15s -> 1570.47s]  You're right.
[1570.47s -> 1571.53s]  You're right.
[1571.53s -> 1573.13s]  See, now you can do this.
[1573.93s -> 1575.53s]  This is how you do it too.
[1575.53s -> 1575.85s]  Yes.
[1576.81s -> 1578.86s]  Isn't that like not fair?
[1578.86s -> 1579.74s]  We only have one sink.
[1580.38s -> 1583.70s]  Okay, we need two mediums.
[1584.50s -> 1591.24s]  Very good.
[1591.88s -> 1594.15s]  Two mediums.
[1594.15s -> 1594.87s]  Got plenty of time.
[1595.59s -> 1602.23s]  Okay, incoming.
[1602.23s -> 1604.15s]  We need one medium.
[1604.15s -> 1606.07s]  One, I don't know what that is.
[1606.07s -> 1607.03s]  One medium, one well.
[1607.59s -> 1612.82s]  Okay, I'll wash this.
[1612.82s -> 1613.22s]  I'll wash.
[1613.22s -> 1613.94s]  It's going to be a second.
[1613.94s -> 1614.90s]  Can you entertain them?
[1614.90s -> 1615.14s]  Enter.
[1616.10s -> 1616.58s]  I'll wash.
[1616.58s -> 1616.90s]  I'll wash.
[1616.90s -> 1617.62s]  I'll wash.
[1617.62s -> 1626.34s]  Okay, one well, one medium.
[1626.90s -> 1630.57s]  Put it down.
[1632.49s -> 1635.88s]  Now we need one well, one medium again.
[1636.94s -> 1637.90s]  I will do the dishes here.
[1637.90s -> 1638.86s]  You just pick it.
[1638.86s -> 1639.42s]  You clean.
[1639.42s -> 1640.14s]  I mean, you cook.
[1641.42s -> 1641.66s]  What?
[1641.66s -> 1642.94s]  I'm doing everything.
[1642.94s -> 1643.74s]  You cook, you clean.
[1646.94s -> 1648.38s]  You do everything.
[1648.38s -> 1649.26s]  Hey, just do everything.
[1649.26s -> 1650.62s]  And I'm going to like just stand around.
[1661.46s -> 1663.59s]  What kind of mom's dust?
[1663.59s -> 1664.31s]  Why are you standing still?
[1664.31s -> 1665.03s]  What's a well done?
[1665.75s -> 1667.75s]  When you were just standing still.
[1668.31s -> 1669.59s]  The day's over, dude.
[1670.87s -> 1672.55s]  It's like four minutes before closing
[1672.55s -> 1674.87s]  and you're like, you could be cleaning.
[1676.62s -> 1678.38s]  You know that we have the auto clean
[1678.38s -> 1680.78s]  end of the day imaginary auto clean restaurant.
[1681.42s -> 1682.38s]  I actually didn't know that.
[1685.24s -> 1686.76s]  Can you fill up our loading bar faster?
[1688.78s -> 1690.30s]  Okay, we got a lot of money now.
[1691.61s -> 1692.25s]  So what we got?
[1692.25s -> 1693.53s]  How much do we have?
[1693.53s -> 1695.21s]  We got eight extra plates.
[1695.85s -> 1697.05s]  We don't have a lot of plates.
[1697.05s -> 1697.77s]  I like that.
[1697.77s -> 1698.49s]  That sounds great.
[1698.49s -> 1700.09s]  That feels like too many plates.
[1700.09s -> 1701.13s]  I need that many plates.
[1701.69s -> 1703.85s]  No, that's going to be too many.
[1703.85s -> 1706.25s]  They're going to be on the ground and scattered.
[1706.25s -> 1707.13s]  Watch what happens.
[1707.13s -> 1711.24s]  Can't place it in this corner.
[1711.24s -> 1713.16s]  How can we sound like you have a joint hit in your lungs?
[1715.22s -> 1716.66s]  I can't place it anywhere.
[1716.66s -> 1717.70s]  It's because I'm 40.
[1717.70s -> 1718.98s]  Oh, I'm pressing the wrong button.
[1720.34s -> 1721.30s]  That's our plate room.
[1722.62s -> 1723.50s]  A plate room?
[1724.70s -> 1725.74s]  You don't have a plate room?
[1726.62s -> 1728.22s]  Actually, that's not a bad place for it.
[1728.86s -> 1730.81s]  That's a huge stack.
[1730.81s -> 1732.84s]  I told you this is too much
[1732.84s -> 1734.86s]  because now we have 12 plates.
[1734.86s -> 1736.46s]  A research grant?
[1736.46s -> 1738.09s]  What is a research grant?
[1738.09s -> 1739.93s]  Let's take this and figure out what it is.
[1739.93s -> 1741.29s]  Upgrade a blueprint.
[1741.29s -> 1745.34s]  What does it do?
[1745.34s -> 1749.18s]  That's our potions, if you need any potions over here.
[1749.18s -> 1751.05s]  What does it actually do?
[1751.05s -> 1752.25s]  I don't know.
[1752.25s -> 1754.89s]  I think it's a research so we get better stuff later.
[1754.89s -> 1757.13s]  So presumably we can cook more than just freaking steaks
[1757.13s -> 1758.01s]  and we make more money.
[1760.22s -> 1761.93s]  We got no more money.
[1761.93s -> 1765.16s]  Hold to carry two items at once.
[1765.16s -> 1766.60s]  My ears just rang when I did that.
[1766.60s -> 1769.26s]  I'm not doing that again.
[1769.26s -> 1771.32s]  My like ears are ringing.
[1771.80s -> 1774.38s]  You ready?
[1774.38s -> 1774.86s]  I'm ready.
[1776.42s -> 1778.42s]  We've got more plates than we have chairs.
[1778.42s -> 1784.98s]  What idiot bought all these plates?
[1784.98s -> 1786.18s]  Okay, they're going to want steaks.
[1790.52s -> 1793.56s]  We got a medium and a raw.
[1795.29s -> 1796.09s]  Medium and raw.
[1799.02s -> 1799.66s]  That's not correct.
[1803.62s -> 1807.10s]  What are you doing?
[1808.86s -> 1809.82s]  You actually just ruined it.
[1811.42s -> 1816.84s]  It's still day three.
[1817.40s -> 1817.88s]  That's good.
[1818.52s -> 1819.48s]  With the tutorial.
[1822.39s -> 1826.15s]  You don't have to put them on the table till they're all ready though.
[1826.87s -> 1828.71s]  Maybe that was actually your fault.
[1828.71s -> 1829.99s]  You didn't cook it right.
[1829.99s -> 1833.26s]  Wait, we didn't buy everything again.
[1833.26s -> 1836.30s]  You want me to do the cooking and you can do the kind of placement stuff?
[1836.30s -> 1838.89s]  Okay, do you think you can handle it?
[1838.89s -> 1839.45s]  What was the...
[1842.47s -> 1845.64s]  It's the easiest job in the restaurant.
[1845.64s -> 1847.72s]  Do you think you deserve to be the chef?
[1848.98s -> 1849.70s]  Yeah, let's see.
[1849.70s -> 1852.02s]  Go, go, go.
[1853.14s -> 1854.34s]  You didn't buy your plates yet.
[1854.34s -> 1855.38s]  You were so into that.
[1855.62s -> 1856.50s]  You don't need the plate.
[1856.50s -> 1857.62s]  You're the chef.
[1857.62s -> 1858.34s]  I'll be fine.
[1859.06s -> 1860.10s]  All right, let's go.
[1860.66s -> 1862.33s]  Let's show you how it's done.
[1865.64s -> 1868.84s]  I want you to call out L, M, H.
[1869.77s -> 1872.49s]  L is raw, M is medium, H is high.
[1872.49s -> 1874.57s]  I honestly don't understand what the shades are.
[1875.83s -> 1876.63s]  Low, medium, high.
[1878.28s -> 1878.76s]  M, H.
[1879.40s -> 1879.64s]  See?
[1886.17s -> 1889.69s]  So you guys are celebrating anything?
[1889.69s -> 1892.25s]  Is any of your birthdays today?
[1892.25s -> 1894.33s]  Anyone celebrating anything today?
[1894.33s -> 1895.45s]  You're going to come get the food?
[1896.25s -> 1897.85s]  Can you fucking let me do my job?
[1902.18s -> 1902.82s]  Call it out, please.
[1907.61s -> 1908.01s]  L, M.
[1908.73s -> 1909.05s]  See?
[1909.05s -> 1909.53s]  Look at that.
[1910.25s -> 1914.50s]  Let me do my job.
[1927.86s -> 1930.10s]  Oh my god, we can't open that door if someone sits there.
[1931.90s -> 1933.66s]  Hey, hey, hey, I need some orders.
[1933.66s -> 1934.62s]  Uh, L.
[1934.62s -> 1935.58s]  Is there already one there for you?
[1938.33s -> 1939.61s]  Oh no, I didn't mean to...
[1940.81s -> 1941.61s]  Sorry.
[1941.61s -> 1950.46s]  The plates are piling up, friend.
[1951.26s -> 1955.53s]  What do they want?
[1955.53s -> 1956.57s]  Any orders?
[1956.57s -> 1957.37s]  I haven't ordered...
[1957.37s -> 1959.85s]  I don't have to ask them yet.
[1959.85s -> 1960.97s]  You put them on to...
[1960.97s -> 1962.41s]  I can't drop this plate.
[1962.57s -> 1963.69s]  I cannot drop this plate.
[1963.69s -> 1965.13s]  We need more counter space.
[1965.13s -> 1966.89s]  We need more counter space.
[1967.91s -> 1968.79s]  We need more counter space.
[1968.79s -> 1969.67s]  Does anybody want this?
[1971.16s -> 1972.68s]  I can't put this down anywhere.
[1972.68s -> 1974.12s]  I cannot put this down anywhere.

[2622.64s -> 2631.10s]  we put like the ingredients in don't chop them but you don't chop no chop oh
[2631.10s -> 2638.76s]  okay so one onion onion and water makes the broth and then we take the mushroom
[2638.76s -> 2645.72s]  does the mushroom need to be cut up I don't think you can't even chop the
[2645.72s -> 2653.09s]  mushrooms but you already can that one's already cut okay so that this is done
[2653.13s -> 2658.86s]  and then you said this one's cut already so do we add this so we now that a
[2658.86s -> 2667.36s]  chopped mushroom goes in and then that makes that and now we have this and we
[2667.36s -> 2674.80s]  can put it on a plate okay so if somebody wants a steak with that
[2674.80s -> 2679.76s]  mushroom sauce we just have to go up to it and press like the action button here
[2679.76s -> 2688.36s]  try that there's no steak I think you got to put that on top of the steak okay
[2688.36s -> 2692.88s]  so then go and get the sauce on it okay okay here's what we do then here's the
[2693.72s -> 2697.64s]  play right as soon as the day starts or even if it lets you do it before it we
[2697.64s -> 2701.92s]  prep the soup we prep we should just leave that on the side we should prep
[2701.92s -> 2705.76s]  two of them have just a bunch of it I don't think we have enough counters to
[2705.76s -> 2708.92s]  prep to otherwise like we're gonna be we're gonna be able to put plates
[2708.92s -> 2712.45s]  anywhere I agree okay yeah so let's make let's make a broth in the morning and
[2712.45s -> 2718.95s]  then after the broth is made then we open the store okay yeah that sounds
[2718.95s -> 2728.66s]  good I agree with that do you need help making the broth I think I I think I got
[2728.66s -> 2737.30s]  it okay ready hold on well let me let me start making it like I'm not sure of
[2737.30s -> 2742.94s]  starting the day oh we have to start the day first yeah so you got everything in
[2742.94s -> 2768.86s]  your brain ready what you need to do yes chef yep mushroom how long until they
[2768.86s -> 2776.20s]  get annoyed was the mushroom supposed to be chopped yeah then this goes in we
[2776.20s -> 2779.86s]  need to the burner okay that's going in and then this is gonna be done oh I see
[2779.86s -> 2785.90s]  okay I'm gonna take the order make the order what they want an L and an H with
[2785.90s -> 2793.10s]  sauce okay L and then H with sauce all right I take the take the L when it's
[2793.10s -> 2799.78s]  here you take the fucking L okay don't get don't do not what because then it's
[2799.78s -> 2808.96s]  the timer before you can place the fucking we're good oh we're good we're
[2808.96s -> 2812.28s]  fine I just that was a delicious scrumptious meal and they just enjoyed
[2812.28s -> 2818.60s]  it taking the order H with sauce do these fuckers they want all this sauce
[2818.60s -> 2824.43s]  on an eight it takes so long to fucking cook and they just want it now don't
[2824.43s -> 2854.34s]  take the other order and with sauce okay okay M with sauce yep okay taking the
[2854.34s -> 2879.12s]  order good L with sauce and then L L with sauce L well done two M's medium
[2879.12s -> 2888.28s]  right I think that's I think that's well done I know that's well down to H to
[2888.28s -> 2903.36s]  a cheese can you grab that um grab that a G is a sauce good for more than one
[2903.36s -> 2911.87s]  day I think that was pretty clean it was good and we said what the fuck why
[2911.87s -> 2917.43s]  aren't they fighting anymore uh cuz we found that it's better to cooperate we
[2917.43s -> 2923.96s]  found you know our flow what works for us if my server did that I wouldn't
[2923.96s -> 2930.90s]  return let's spin around it be like whoa I think that I think that I added
[2930.90s -> 2936.40s]  something to the atmosphere worth coming back for but you don't think it'd be
[2936.40s -> 2941.52s]  funny if like the server walked out with a big plate of food nice and hot and did
[2941.52s -> 2945.92s]  a I'm gonna pass it underneath the leg kind of like a basketball and grab it
[2945.92s -> 2950.70s]  with the other hand and pick it up you don't think that'd be funny chef look at
[2950.70s -> 2953.98s]  this look at this one down here this one you might want to consider here chef we
[2953.98s -> 2959.14s]  can afford the gas override so what does this do cooks faster burns faster I
[2959.14s -> 2964.41s]  feel like that's terrifying is that a little too scary do we even have a
[2964.41s -> 2969.00s]  garbage by the way I that's the kind of thing you do if there's four people in
[2969.00s -> 2975.57s]  here I don't know this is a two-person upgrade what is this filing cabinet oh
[2975.57s -> 2986.16s]  do you want another dining table I'm stuffed in the corner I don't think we
[2986.16s -> 2990.52s]  need we're actually maybe to make it so people won't sit outside okay and then
[2990.52s -> 2995.89s]  we'll start and remember this is like a do or die all right well let me get my
[2995.89s -> 3005.79s]  right okay so let me get my sauce ready I'm gonna belch like a weirdo okay wait
[3005.79s -> 3009.26s]  it actually might be nice to have another counter yeah get it get it I
[3009.26s -> 3013.76s]  didn't see that there was a counter yeah we are starved for counter space oh
[3013.76s -> 3022.70s]  okay oh man oh geez it's really coming together is that a good place for it I
[3022.70s -> 3028.38s]  think we need to can we expand the restaurant no I think the layout we

[4114.98s -> 4121.94s]  twice so that's it oh this is gonna be easy all right cool I like this layout a
[4121.94s -> 4125.70s]  lot this is way better than the other layout you don't got to cook anything

[4142.15s -> 4148.26s]  maybe I should have been the one learning how to make it I mean dude it's
[4148.26s -> 4152.88s]  literally just chop a tomato and chop lettuce put it on a plate it's not that
[4152.88s -> 4171.43s]  hard I mean it's hard when you keep covering up every fucking surface now if
[4171.43s -> 4175.03s]  you do that if you chop the tomato twice it makes tomato soup be aware of that
[4175.03s -> 4180.32s]  oh and I gotta cut I gotta chop that it's just it's just chopped okay I'm
[4180.32s -> 4192.48s]  ready that is it okay let's really okay we don't have any money so we can't do
[4192.48s -> 4197.48s]  any wait booking desk interact to accelerate time to next customer it's
[4197.48s -> 4208.90s]  like a hard mode how confident are you you want to do that um yeah let's do
[4208.90s -> 4219.01s]  that like you handle you handle the exterior I'll be in the interior I'm
[4219.01s -> 4223.41s]  gonna be ready we're gonna be feeding each other through here sounds good all
[4223.41s -> 4233.92s]  right I'm ready thank us fucking order I'm just why I thought you want a little
[4233.92s -> 4253.08s]  bit of time perfect you gotta memorize that layout I saw you move around a
[4253.08s -> 4257.32s]  little oh you're really gonna backseat that backseat me just look over the
[4257.32s -> 4259.84s]  counter because you have nothing to do and just tell oh you're a little bit
[4259.84s -> 4264.91s]  slow there buddy take their fucking order all right this person just was a
[4264.91s -> 4273.26s]  lettuce lettuce and all right we got to think of some how to describe this some
[4273.26s -> 4280.65s]  people are gonna just want lettuce okay just say lettuce an actual real salad
[4280.65s -> 4285.76s]  that's too long to say that like this person wants lettuce I think okay well
[4285.76s -> 4291.98s]  today come up with what you want all right it just by default fucking order
[4292.14s -> 4295.94s]  hold on I did it's going to nighttime we won't get the money if we don't serve
[4295.94s -> 4301.50s]  them okay so when I say to mate that means the whole thing to me if I say two
[4301.50s -> 4306.14s]  orders and I say one to mate that means the tomato goes on one you understand
[4306.14s -> 4312.85s]  to mate the whole thing or what was the other one okay so we got two teammates
[4312.85s -> 4335.50s]  that means the whole works everything tomato and lettuce just say salad no
[4335.50s -> 4341.34s]  salad okay I was focused on the task you say to mate if it's the whole with
[4341.34s -> 4346.26s]  tomatoes right and what do you say when it's not with tomatoes nothing if I say
[4346.26s -> 4357.00s]  there are two orders one to mate is this too much for you I feel like when they
[4357.00s -> 4361.92s]  order something and you say nothing if no sounds like I'm going to tell you the
[4361.92s -> 4365.72s]  number so three customers come in and sit down right now and they order three
[4365.72s -> 4370.08s]  different salads I am gonna say but later later on three customers two
[4370.08s -> 4376.04s]  teammates later on when we're handling more than you know one type of food like
[4376.04s -> 4381.56s]  if we had steaks in the mix yeah you omitting the type of sat when you can't
[4381.56s -> 4391.25s]  just say fucking salad what's your point it's gonna cause it's what I'm saying
[4391.25s -> 4395.15s]  well we're not good but we're not okay do you see how many levels in a row we
[4395.15s -> 4400.26s]  had steaks it's gonna be like this for the least the next 40 minutes but once
[4400.30s -> 4405.53s]  it changes you're gonna change everything okay so how about this if
[4405.53s -> 4412.81s]  they're if it's salad I'm gonna say salad with tomato that sucks though no
[4412.81s -> 4421.50s]  it's we gotta do it like a diner okay I'm ready you you just say what you're
[4421.50s -> 4425.55s]  gonna say and I'll try and react I'm telling you you're gonna get it and
[4425.55s -> 4445.67s]  you'll be like and when it's gone you're gonna miss it too one to mate yeah I
[4445.67s -> 4453.75s]  want to mate with you two salads one to mate how's that is that better on two
[4453.95s -> 4470.15s]  that works for me good plane salad yeah plane plane plane plane this only works
[4470.15s -> 4473.91s]  if more than one person is sitting at a table I'm realizing that right now
[4473.91s -> 4478.23s]  there's a lot of issues like we there was there's nothing on the menu called
[4478.23s -> 4483.27s]  plane based on what we just discussed for like 10 minutes to make salad
[4483.27s -> 4495.39s]  apology with tears now just say salad yeah but what if the salad salad with
[4495.39s -> 4519.96s]  me yeah we can take that order just cleaning two salads one to mate two
[4519.96s -> 4532.90s]  salads two to mate I fuck I made the soup oh you turned it into soup it's
[4532.90s -> 4537.06s]  easy to do by accident I'm just so strong don't you dare put that down I
[4537.06s -> 4548.79s]  have you noticed I have not you imagine your waiter hovering over your table
[4548.79s -> 4551.83s]  with a plate of food ready for you to eat it and just staring like waiting and
[4551.83s -> 4560.57s]  then waiting for you to be done yeah very cool I put on these cat ears so
[4560.57s -> 4562.93s]  that I could be the like the one interacting with the guests by the way I
[4562.93s -> 4571.23s]  just want to point that out and I'm stuck in the kitchen I don't think we
[4571.23s -> 4578.25s]  need more seats I need another counter we always need a counter more buffer
[4578.25s -> 4584.43s]  increase the movement speed and prevent spills that's all pensive can't counter
[4584.43s -> 4589.82s]  here we go right here got a counter for you what do you want it in the corner
[4589.82s -> 4600.03s]  this corner up here yeah okay we're good to go that's a good setup actually I'm
[4600.07s -> 4608.65s]  curious if you can grab diagonally if you can like grab that plate do you try
[4608.65s -> 4619.72s]  yeah oh good yeah this is awesome okay here we go two salad two to mate well I
[4619.72s -> 4623.08s]  can also like if we're in a hurry I can put stuff down you could start chopping
[4623.08s -> 4649.97s]  it oh I can chop it from here you're right one salad to mate man this is too
[4649.97s -> 4658.30s]  easy this is like taking money from babies they're paying for food one to
[4658.30s -> 4675.18s]  mate salad themselves clean that plate okay come on come on come on come on one
[4675.18s -> 4685.34s]  salad nothing on it I don't know if I could do that here I enjoy your fucking
[4685.34s -> 4697.85s]  grass one salad one to mate ah wash the dishes because I have to walk I would
[4697.85s -> 4706.19s]  have to walk across the whole thing I got customers out here they complaining
[4706.19s -> 4710.51s]  one salad one to mate still waiting for it it's hard to make these there's like
[4710.51s -> 4728.84s]  so many steps mates out we need an extra sink we actually put a sink out
[4728.84s -> 4733.12s]  here you actually should put that sink out here that makes so much sense that
[4733.12s -> 4749.22s]  makes so much sense yeah you mean let me have that sink over oh 25% love oh you
[4749.22s -> 4755.73s]  get it wait why would we do that yeah why show me a potato salad but why would
[4755.73s -> 4762.31s]  we do the one on the left I don't case you're scared of making potato salad
[4762.35s -> 4770.30s]  you're the one making it make the customers do their own dishes chop a
[4770.30s -> 4776.29s]  potato add to water in a pot and boil we don't even have a stove oh they
[4776.29s -> 4782.10s]  probably gave us the stove wait wait wait wait wait wait a second I need to
[4782.10s -> 4786.96s]  like screenshot this no just go into practice I'm telling you it looks that
[4786.96s -> 4790.68s]  was intimidating when I looked at it too but it's literally easy you just have to
[4790.68s -> 4793.96s]  go and put it I'm putting that description on my other monitor in case
[4793.96s -> 4797.87s]  I have a dumb moment I've got a little cheat sheet okay so let's go into
[4797.87s -> 4804.32s]  practice real quick oh we need to open all our parcels well we just got an
[4804.32s -> 4813.88s]  oven for free yeah cuz we needed to make the salad was that eggs because I have
[4813.88s -> 4820.69s]  to crack an egg oh dude and I'm in the kitchen all fucking alone dude oh man
[4820.69s -> 4826.30s]  home hey how do you think I felt they need to make the sauce every day how
[4826.30s -> 4833.82s]  about this you want me to add the olive oil how about we put the sink down in
[4833.82s -> 4840.68s]  that room I can wash the dishes if that's what you want me to do do you
[4840.72s -> 4843.88s]  want the sink up in the corner so we can just put them right on the put yep yeah
[4843.88s -> 4847.08s]  put the sink right there that's so perfect because then I can put it right
[4847.08s -> 4855.17s]  here I can put the clean plates right here this you don't really have a whole
[4855.17s -> 4863.69s]  lot of room in there olive oils over there I'm gonna need the sink to add
[4863.69s -> 4872.28s]  water to a pot for the salad I get okay I don't I don't know if it's like the
[4872.28s -> 4875.30s]  thing you were making we only have to make it once I don't know let's do
[4875.30s -> 4878.48s]  practice because if you pass it to me I can fill the pot and just put it back
[4878.48s -> 4882.90s]  over here yeah I just want to figure out this layout on this is the olive
[4882.90s -> 4896.79s]  Jesus Christ told you we could add this one thing to the menu okay let's do
[4896.79s -> 4905.99s]  practice instead of you want another counter we're down here in the lower
[4905.99s -> 4911.79s]  right yeah absolutely always counter I think you can even have a counter out
[4911.79s -> 4917.82s]  there for an extra dirty plate so I somebody saying you should do the olive
[4917.82s -> 4923.67s]  oil I mean I should yeah like you as in me like I should do the finishing on it
[4923.67s -> 4934.56s]  maybe well let's just practice it say here let me wait don't do it yet let me
[4934.56s -> 4954.03s]  I can hit B it's easy I'm stressed okay let's go ready practice okay this plate
[4954.03s -> 4969.66s]  up chop potato add water water this up germa germa drink germa germa my drink
[4969.66s -> 4980.06s]  right there they want okay we want whoever that is then you boil that
[4980.06s -> 4984.70s]  what's your next step this is crack egg and add olive oil so I think you need to
[4984.70s -> 4991.04s]  put olive oil in that egg okay I think I just did okay then yeah then the
[4991.04s -> 5002.42s]  potatoes are ready to go combine all three out of plate oh my god I got to
[5002.42s -> 5008.58s]  boil the potatoes every fucking Jesus every time rice interesting okay and then
[5008.58s -> 5017.43s]  yes let me to make salad if I put the pot there it needs water I thought you're
[5017.43s -> 5022.26s]  gonna put I thought you're gonna do tomato I'm just because it's practice I
[5022.74s -> 5026.34s]  don't think that's done by the way that doesn't look like the thing the cat
[5026.34s -> 5033.59s]  wants is it missing something it looks like a different picture doesn't it
[5033.59s -> 5041.81s]  yeah okay let me let me go through this one by one chop a potato oh you're
[5041.81s -> 5053.99s]  missing the onion add to water in a pot crack an egg olive oil with the egg chop
[5053.99s -> 5065.08s]  onions I didn't skip the onions and then you just you just throw that on the you
[5065.56s -> 5083.81s]  plate then I need an empty plate and I gotta like I'm not I I don't know about
[5083.81s -> 5091.50s]  this man we got it we're gonna leave practice how about you do make it a
[5091.50s -> 5096.03s]  couple times make it like two three times okay let's okay so in this pot
[5096.03s -> 5102.38s]  means I need water hot say it to go pot and when you need oil just say like
[5102.38s -> 5112.25s]  like grease oil egg oil egg oil egg that's too many syllables grease is one
[5112.25s -> 5131.85s]  and then water what I'm missing the onion okay onion comes at the end I think
[5131.85s -> 5136.09s]  I'm good I think I'm good are you good just a lot of steps try it one more time
[5136.09s -> 5143.54s]  just say oil oil is two syllables no grease oil oil is two syllables this
[5144.10s -> 5151.54s]  oil oil grease oil oil I don't want our customers to think we're greasing up
[5151.54s -> 5158.24s]  their food no just say grease just say grease grease yes thank you right wait
[5158.24s -> 5164.75s]  up you're that extra quarter of a second could be time you're chopping the onion

[5581.69s -> 5587.23s]  we can handle a few people yeah no we're good we got it okay I just think that
[5587.23s -> 5595.41s]  there may be like one step of this that like you could help with and what do you
[5595.41s -> 5599.73s]  want that to be all you said was are you put dough here and you screamed at me and
[5599.73s -> 5603.09s]  you said why are you not kneading the dough which I didn't even know that that
[5603.09s -> 5607.49s]  that needed um you took the screenshot remember you remember you it was on the
[5607.49s -> 5615.04s]  screen and you just pressed a yeah I remember here um let's see what we got
[5615.04s -> 5624.90s]  I think just wasn't with another counter that'll be a lot easier I think that's
[5624.90s -> 5629.87s]  all I really need and we've got like the three like the Omega counter set up your
[5629.87s -> 5635.54s]  plates and sink I could do plates I could do plates and sink yeah you you
[5635.54s -> 5639.34s]  give me the option to do something in here and I will leave your kitchen alone
[5639.34s -> 5650.73s]  yeah cuz uh yeah you were spending a lot of time watching me and judging me so
[5650.73s -> 5653.81s]  yeah you put those where you want we're all just pointing and laughing at you

[5672.52s -> 5688.46s]  you could do it there would you eat a raw pizza for a trillion dollars yes but
[5688.46s -> 5694.33s]  I could literally change the entire earth if I had a trillion dollars like
[5694.33s -> 5698.33s]  would even just eat a raw pizza and like shit my pants and puke for a day like a
[5698.33s -> 5703.78s]  trillion dollars but what is this I could solve every problem probably on

[5732.81s -> 5737.13s]  put pizzas on them yes like just play it by ear we'll figure it out during the
[5737.13s -> 5757.02s]  day sounds good I wonder what this person's gonna order you can take it

[5942.86s -> 5948.29s]  when does a jalapeno become like super hot they're all pretty much the same
[5948.53s -> 5951.93s]  you might get one with a lot of seeds but it's really not that hot jalapenos
[5951.93s -> 5958.14s]  are pretty low on the scale okay I'm a pretty baby boy to be honest I'm I'm kind
[5958.14s -> 5961.94s]  of like a little toddler they are fresh-cut jalapenos that's why they're
[5961.94s -> 5966.09s]  the best they're not really that hot now you get that kind of run-of-the-mouth
[5966.09s -> 5970.18s]  tangle but they're not they're not that bad they're not yeah I remember I would
[5970.18s -> 5980.14s]  also get them with a green pepper yeah a little bit of green pepper that's not
[5980.14s -> 5992.27s]  bad barbecue sauce on a burger is nice barbecue sauce on a lot of stuff is kind

[6153.72s -> 6162.98s]  walk slower you can handle walking slower right yeah yeah where pizza place
[6162.98s -> 6169.17s]  we don't do pumpkin pie I want to come in for a little bit of pie and some pie

[6185.86s -> 6195.76s]  is it is it was today the 9th I don't know if you should eat that Christmas how
[6195.76s -> 6201.37s]  long what kind of pie is that eat that pie yeah I don't think you should eat
[6201.37s -> 6215.10s]  that pie this thing cleans floor messes faster rip chat member we got another
[6215.10s -> 6218.91s]  table let's get that yeah that's a big deal I'm gonna put this in the corner
[6218.91s -> 6223.75s]  yeah we want to keep them away from the kitchen too because you'll walk slower
[6223.75s -> 6228.46s]  if you're near him so we want them like on this on this side yeah I think that's
[6228.46s -> 6238.59s]  not maybe this corner and then don't put them by that door trust me even we
[6238.59s -> 6243.78s]  have never sat more than three people okay you might have trouble getting to
[6243.78s -> 6253.95s]  the people in the corner only one person at least two there you go two two two
[6253.95s -> 6259.46s]  okay wait what is that sign I thought did you write that that's the name of
[6259.46s -> 6263.42s]  the restaurant I just saw that I just saw pussy I'm like wait why did you do

[6289.67s -> 6294.79s]  also holds eight instead of those so they're easier to stack and that's the
[6294.79s -> 6301.22s]  last decision if you want an extra set of plates I think we need more counters
[6301.22s -> 6304.94s]  before we have more plates well then we would have to reroll the blueprints
[6304.94s -> 6317.87s]  there buddy why did you read it because that's the name of the sign dumb waiter

[7701.92s -> 7707.47s]  that stir was even there I mean that's like one of my favorite streams I've
[7707.47s -> 7713.62s]  ever done do you think I forgot it someone have been telling me about the
[7713.62s -> 7717.33s]  baseball thing for like a year if I wanted to come down and and then what do

[7852.74s -> 7856.90s]  like delete counters at a certain point like if we wanted to delete this plate
[7856.90s -> 7866.71s]  tray so we can get the bigger plates yeah yes yeah one star yeah yeah dude
[7866.71s -> 7877.66s]  nice my heart messed up now racing why are you pretending isn't that this
[7877.66s -> 7892.87s]  chopped onion is a pizza topping let's get oh finally chopped onion and add to
[7892.87s -> 7900.89s]  pizza before read it was wait was it before cooking I don't know what do you
[7900.89s -> 7915.79s]  think it sounded like you said before or before you don't even like
[7915.79s -> 7922.07s]  pizza you poser who doesn't like pizza oh yeah okay so I think we can buy the
[7922.07s -> 7926.35s]  bigger stack of plates and if we put the this stack of plates outside it deletes
[7926.35s -> 7934.85s]  it is what I think oh yeah there's a trash out here
[7934.85s -> 7940.14s]  some of you guys not like pizza oh and you sell it I don't know if you get
[7940.14s -> 7944.66s]  money for it I feel like humans have developed these taste buds that pizza
[7944.66s -> 7948.96s]  just hits everything that you like and I feel like it's impossible to not enjoy
[7949.16s -> 7956.61s]  the taste of pizza tomato sauce has that savory on the your savory taste buds
[7956.61s -> 7961.64s]  cheese hits you you know I mean it's I feel like it's impossible I've never
[7961.64s -> 7972.44s]  been hit by these humans were built to enjoy pizza it's like our mouths were
[7972.44s -> 7981.08s]  created to like to enjoy that flavor yeah I think that's in the Bible yeah
[7981.08s -> 7986.42s]  when when when when Jesus makes the pizza and serves it at the last day
[7986.42s -> 8001.50s]  hey good gonna get a plate ready for you up here back I'm gonna get two plates
[8001.50s -> 8013.96s]  ready don't be mad at me I'm mad okay so here's the issue they want onion and
[8013.96s -> 8019.84s]  not onion do I gotta cook two pizza do I got fucking two pizzas right now yeah I
[8019.84s -> 8025.85s]  think so I can't just put half on a pie like a fucking competent human being we
[8025.85s -> 8032.57s]  can't I'm gonna move this out of the way temporarily what does this person want
[8032.57s -> 8038.11s]  onion all right we've got an onion we've got an onion we're good okay what if he
[8038.11s -> 8041.35s]  didn't want an onion what if he wanted that was a gamble I was really what if
[8041.35s -> 8046.36s]  he wanted to see me dance in my cat outfit then I did I don't know but yeah
[8046.36s -> 8052.10s]  he wanted onion and I the second you get me that other one we're good to go okay
[8052.10s -> 8055.40s]  just gonna make this happen really quickly I know they're getting a little
[8055.40s -> 8065.32s]  upset but you're different you're the weird one like you are the weird one
[8065.36s -> 8077.62s]  I'm role-playing okay hold on we need they just want cheese yeah we should
[8077.62s -> 8083.14s]  have enough there is yeah I'm gonna claim this plate you got another pie

[8138.94s -> 8151.97s]  a little bit oil making the final emergency pie we should have we have
[8151.97s -> 8155.49s]  everything unless they want to onion unless these assholes actually want two
[8155.49s -> 8167.16s]  onions no we're good thank God imagine hearing that like well I guess I guess
[8167.16s -> 8172.17s]  we're gonna order the cheese then I uh every once in a while I really enjoy
[8172.17s -> 8180.92s]  watching some of like the trashiest possible reality TV and it was
[8180.92s -> 8184.24s]  recommended by my sister-in-law was saying that um what's the name of the
[8184.24s -> 8189.46s]  show the rich people on yachts fucking below deck they like follow the crew of
[8189.46s -> 8193.52s]  a yacht that need to like serve like rich pampered people and I fucking loved
[8193.52s -> 8197.08s]  the chef because like every time someone would order something he didn't like he
[8197.08s -> 8201.99s]  just like stop he's fucking idiots so I'm channeling that a bit what would
[8201.99s -> 8210.62s]  what network is this on uh on Bravo whoo into the counter I know you like those
[8210.62s -> 8216.16s]  I think we have enough counters unless we want to throw another like there's
[8216.16s -> 8221.62s]  actually no room for it could why I put it up in this corner hey rolling pin
[8221.62s -> 8226.56s]  three times faster and rolling the dough uh it rolls really fast I don't think we
[8226.56s -> 8233.64s]  need that that's like the fastest part of the process okay so let me I'm gonna
[8233.64s -> 8241.91s]  get the extra counter we're gonna put it I let me do my thing here darling I'm
[8241.91s -> 8246.51s]  gonna put these here as honestly like I feel like I'm running in here way too
[8246.51s -> 8256.86s]  much is that a good spot though can I switch it yeah I can get it we need the
[8256.86s -> 8263.13s]  research desk I have no idea what it does what does it do what do we put it
[8263.13s -> 8269.72s]  like what is it for it says it upgrades the thing on a cabinet next to it which
[8269.72s -> 8273.86s]  we put it next to I don't know I don't know I haven't noticed to do anything I
[8273.86s -> 8276.98s]  tried to use it last game when I put it next to the cheese but I guess that's
[8276.98s -> 8280.34s]  not a cabinet put it next to the filing cabinet saying filing cabinet filing
[8280.34s -> 8284.67s]  cabinet well then we'll move the cheese oh it is doing something what is it
[8284.67s -> 8292.18s]  doing though it researches it has to be next to a filing cabinet oh okay thanks
[8292.18s -> 8296.03s]  okay I'm gonna try this new plate set up okay we're good
[8296.03s -> 8304.41s]  whoo you know that's you know that's uh that's looking pretty nasty let's go one
[8304.41s -> 8314.80s]  pizza coming up my little pizzeria in my pepperoni welcome welcome welcome to
[8314.80s -> 8324.85s]  our store alright slice cheese never wanted two slices how many slices do you
[8324.85s -> 8333.64s]  Easter oh I'd like the whole fucking pie I honestly true I will look at how much
[8333.64s -> 8340.80s]  I've eaten from a box of pizza and go oh oops I'd say I'd say I on average eat
[8340.84s -> 8348.50s]  like 75% of the pizza that's a lot but I mean it yeah like I could see that all
[8348.50s -> 8361.33s]  right let's see this one we just cheese right now no onion um no onions yet no
[8361.33s -> 8373.52s]  onions just regular cheese still I'm working on it just need one more all you
[8373.52s -> 8378.06s]  best believe this pizza is coming up this is my best pizza yet this might be
[8378.06s -> 8391.95s]  my magnum opus of pizzas okay thank you no onion at the moment let's see we do
[8391.95s -> 8398.15s]  have an onion now one cheese one onion one onion required here's an onion for
[8398.15s -> 8415.15s]  you sir yeah very good just one slice of cheese over there get that in a second
[8415.15s -> 8429.11s]  pretty smooth we need a one cheese one onion you know what we should open our
[8429.11s -> 8437.90s]  own pizzeria for real isn't that that seems like not a great idea you know
[8437.90s -> 8440.94s]  anything do you know anything about like making pizza I know you know a lot about
[8440.94s -> 8446.18s]  eating pizza but you know about making pizza I make pizzas now and again I
[8446.18s -> 8450.54s]  enjoy making a nice pizza it's pretty simple you have a big paddle that you
[8450.54s -> 8457.35s]  use they're like I think that would make it more fun the big like spatula paddle
[8457.35s -> 8461.47s]  yeah doesn't that just seem awesome like how powerful you'd feel using that
[8461.51s -> 8466.22s]  yeah you get it nice all right but hold on but we have to we have to figure this
[8466.22s -> 8469.94s]  out because I have a kind of a way that I like pizza you probably have a way that
[8469.94s -> 8474.07s]  you like pizza but it's about the customers are we like we're basing this
[8474.07s -> 8477.79s]  around our personal taste and they come in for like the authentic germ area well
[8477.79s -> 8482.31s]  because you need to you need to you know how much you like certain pizza you know
[8482.31s -> 8485.09s]  how you want it to taste what's your pizza toppings what do you what do you
[8485.09s -> 8488.73s]  put on your pizza well I wouldn't make a deep dish pizza place I don't really
[8488.73s -> 8493.23s]  like it and I don't really know about it right I my pizza thin New York style
[8493.27s -> 8500.46s]  crust super crispy not a whole lot of grease super super crunchy that's the
[8500.46s -> 8505.85s]  kind of my favorite pizza super thin what's going on it I mean honestly be
[8505.85s -> 8512.58s]  the not just cheese or pepperoni and I'm talking like you get this shit so thin
[8512.58s -> 8517.46s]  that those places where they throw it into the oven and it's in there for 60
[8517.46s -> 8521.82s]  seconds like so thin and so crispy you could cut someone's throat with it I
[8521.82s -> 8529.69s]  don't know why that's where you're going with this but I mean no so a little bit
[8529.69s -> 8534.97s]  a little bit of give but right okay you're not not them okay let me do let
[8534.97s -> 8538.65s]  me show you like you know I'm talking about when you do that like you bite
[8538.65s -> 8542.99s]  and then you bite bite you know I mean yeah yeah yeah you first bite you bite
[8542.99s -> 8547.84s]  bite bite that's my favorite kind of pizza have you never had deep dish or
[8547.84s -> 8552.80s]  like I've had it's just a lasagna you don't like it it's a it's a lasagna it's
[8552.80s -> 8557.48s]  a lasagna a deep dish pizza is a lasagna to me I don't think that there's like
[8557.48s -> 8562.54s]  bread in a lasagna but it's just like a bunch of sauce it's a lasagna there's a
[8562.54s -> 8566.06s]  bunch of cheese tons of cheese tons of sauce it's like thick it's like I could
[8566.06s -> 8572.85s]  eat it with a fork and knives little Zion okay I did I I don't dislike it a
[8572.85s -> 8580.46s]  deep dish pizza tastes really great I just don't it's more growing up in the
[8580.46s -> 8585.98s]  90s my family really wanted to believe that they were Italian because the
[8585.98s -> 8591.56s]  Sopranos was very popular so they would get Sicilian pies pretty often that's
[8591.80s -> 8597.64s]  it is but that is like a that's basically deep dish mmm that's not like
[8597.64s -> 8603.78s]  deep dish Chicago style that Sicilian kind of you talk about like the square
[8603.78s -> 8610.86s]  slices right yeah that's not deep dish that literally is like deep dish how is
[8610.86s -> 8616.88s]  it not it's just it's just like a better it's just better but it's deep dish well
[8616.88s -> 8624.72s]  deep yeah Sicilian is that's not it's not no it's not see I don't know cuz I
[8624.72s -> 8629.33s]  only like we weren't actually Italian there's a lot of different kinds of
[8629.33s -> 8633.61s]  pizza that you think oh that's that's pizzas all the same there's like a
[8633.61s -> 8638.96s]  dozen at least versions of different pizza there's like Chicago style Detroit
[8638.96s -> 8647.26s]  style there's our own style we go like drama style and like we franchise it and
[8647.26s -> 8651.22s]  everyone would know like I don't like Chicago I like the German rumble pizza
[8651.22s -> 8656.14s]  whatever you would call it so you want us to be like a kid's restaurant no like
[8656.14s -> 8659.94s]  we could come up with like a whole new and there's whipped cream and there's
[8659.94s -> 8666.06s]  there's anchovies and there's the bake style there's got to be like an
[8666.06s -> 8670.98s]  undiscovered bake style I don't I don't think so I think it's I mean maybe this
[8670.98s -> 8674.22s]  is like a new twist but I don't know anything about baking food well that's
[8674.22s -> 8678.54s]  why we got the research desk going on up here all right but to answer the
[8678.54s -> 8682.78s]  question so I what is is your is like that Sicilian like or Detroit style is
[8682.78s -> 8688.33s]  that what you like I mean I think I only would like it if I was near like an
[8688.33s -> 8692.17s]  authentic place that was like we make Sicilian pies we do it good so what if
[8692.17s -> 8696.01s]  otherwise like I'm out here in Texas like everything is a chain restaurant
[8696.01s -> 8700.79s]  there's no real food it was all made like a year ago so I'll make the thin
[8700.79s -> 8705.15s]  crust kind of Connecticut or New York kind of style pizza and you do the like
[8705.15s -> 8707.15s]  Detroit style we have two different ovens we'll just have two we'll just
[8707.15s -> 8711.07s]  compete with each other yeah the competing ovens and you come in you
[8711.07s -> 8715.78s]  got to like put a ballot in we'll just be the Twix brothers but we're in the
[8715.78s -> 8718.94s]  same restaurant so okay so imagine this you walk into the restaurant and it's
[8718.94s -> 8723.33s]  kind of like I'll describe it as a hallway on the left is your pizzeria on
[8723.33s -> 8727.94s]  the right is my pizzeria and like we're shouting at each other across like but
[8727.94s -> 8730.74s]  you can come up to order from me or him and like if you if someone comes up to
[8730.74s -> 8736.78s]  order you know and I try and like haggle them like I'll give you five dollars one
[8736.78s -> 8741.30s]  piece I don't know prices no what I went out fighting over who gets more I'm just
[8741.30s -> 8744.58s]  saying we could have no I think it would be a really cool environment to like sit
[8744.58s -> 8748.70s]  in the middle of like two arguing people trying to make better pizzas and serve
[8748.70s -> 8752.49s]  you better yeah but what if somebody comes in and they want from one side one
[8752.49s -> 8756.73s]  pie from the other side and like we're getting all upset about it but I'm
[8756.73s -> 8761.05s]  never gonna argue to somebody that comes in wanting a Detroit style pizza to eat
[8761.05s -> 8764.70s]  a New York or Connecticut style pizza that they've already come in and they
[8764.70s -> 8769.00s]  already know what they want so they're gonna go to you okay but you could try
[8769.00s -> 8776.41s]  and convince them that they're wrong why would you oh hey I love Detroit style
[8776.41s -> 8779.97s]  pizza oh this place does Detroit style pizza I'm going in there that sounds
[8779.97s -> 8783.97s]  great new place what's it good on Yelp oh like 4.3 I'll try it and then they
[8783.97s -> 8788.74s]  walk in and I go Connecticut style peaches better eat mine you don't want
[8788.74s -> 8791.82s]  his pieces he's got the cockroaches in his pieces you want my pizzas they're

[8800.05s -> 8806.07s]  environment that's just the environment people are omega low in 4.3 on Yelp bro
[8806.07s -> 8815.24s]  that's a high high score on Yelp okay the woman it sounds like you're not in
[8815.24s -> 8819.66s]  on this I mean what you you want to like do a stream where we make pizzas and
[8819.66s -> 8823.42s]  compete and rent out space in like New York City is this what you want to do
[8823.42s -> 8829.84s]  didn't we actually like 20 years ago say it would be like funny to take like
[8829.84s -> 8835.37s]  cooking classes yeah that was this was like a thing it was that was immediately
[8835.37s -> 8840.39s]  dropped it was like totally not ever gonna happen I mean it sounds kind of
[8840.39s -> 8845.85s]  fun yeah maybe we have a lot of the hallway
[8845.85s -> 8859.15s]  pizzeria I would call it the pizza gauntlet you have to sign a waiver
[8859.15s -> 8865.86s]  before you come in because we can get rough let's just save our money man but
[8865.86s -> 8869.78s]  like I'm fucking frisbee-ing the pan the pizza goes on at each other what are
[8869.78s -> 8874.70s]  you talking about I don't know like there could be I don't know like
[8874.70s -> 8879.06s]  anything could happen it's just like you frisbee it at me and it's just perfect
[8879.06s -> 8883.91s]  spiral that big pizza pan just hits me right in the forehead and if it's
[8883.91s -> 8889.99s]  crispy enough again you could really break the skin as is in your
[8889.99s -> 8894.58s]  grandmother's pizza shop so essentially you just want to you just want to make
[8894.58s -> 8898.10s]  a mess for a few hours is what you want to do I think I don't think it has to be
[8898.10s -> 8901.38s]  a mess I just think the end I like you know how you okay imagine this you're
[8901.38s -> 8904.50s]  growing out to eat you're going to a nice restaurant you're with your family
[8904.50s -> 8909.50s]  and like the waiter comes over like everything's nice and proper where can
[8909.50s -> 8916.40s]  you go to just like eat but also get totally fucked up and just to be like
[8916.40s -> 8921.24s]  scared and like a little bit on edge and like looking around but it's like a
[8921.24s -> 8925.42s]  it's like fun it's like you're not actually gonna get jumped like it's the
[8925.42s -> 8929.86s]  other people that are like people are saying Ross Waffle House how many how
[8929.86s -> 8933.70s]  many people watch like people arguing on tik-tok or like these like YouTube like
[8933.70s -> 8937.62s]  all this guy was like freaking out and the Kentucky Fried Chicken that's crazy
[8937.62s -> 8941.10s]  like you would be like that every day but it would just be us doing it so it's
[8941.10s -> 8944.90s]  like but you want like like medieval time like a medieval times restaurant
[8944.90s -> 8950.47s]  like with actors or do you what do you mean I mean in a sense I guess we are
[8950.47s -> 8955.38s]  acting through the competition of our pies so you're talking about like hey
[8955.38s -> 8960.62s]  when you come in here and sit down we're actively trying to hurt each other
[8960.62s -> 8963.42s]  we you and I are actively trying to hurt each other and people are like in here
[8963.42s -> 8971.11s]  it's like wrestling like WWF competition pies and like we're putting on like a
[8971.11s -> 8976.44s]  show like some people like is this real I was cool you know and like we're gonna
[8976.44s -> 8981.30s]  be making their food but also it's like fighting each other we don't have to
[8981.30s -> 8984.58s]  like physically fight but we're definitely gonna be in verbal arguments
[8984.58s -> 8988.46s]  there could be things being thrown so I send out like this guy like you know
[8988.46s -> 8992.06s]  like Louie comes out to like to like go fight you or something he's got like a
[8992.06s -> 8996.34s]  yeah and then I send out my goon and he's like fucking Louie or something and
[8996.34s -> 9004.50s]  then they just like brawl PVP pizza restaurant yeah kinda it's like a
[9004.50s -> 9009.18s]  theater it's like food and a show like every day at 630 we do the same bit
[9009.18s -> 9013.00s]  we're like we've practiced this for years where we like toss pies across the
[9013.00s -> 9016.34s]  room and like you catch it and throw it back and it's spinning and I catch and I
[9016.34s -> 9018.94s]  twirl and I put it down on the you know and I start cooking you know what I'm
[9018.94s -> 9022.46s]  saying but you if you're doing Detroit style pizza if I throw my dough over
[9022.46s -> 9026.58s]  there it's gonna ruin your entire thing eventually it comes back to you and then
[9026.58s -> 9031.58s]  like pizza it's the combo pizza we do one combo pizza a day 630 it's a whole
[9031.58s -> 9036.02s]  bit and like it's the best pie you got to get you got to be there at 6 and I
[9036.02s -> 9038.66s]  gotta come out I gotta come out with my fully done pie to the customer and be
[9038.66s -> 9042.90s]  like okay here you go guys I know you and you come up from behind me and you
[9042.90s -> 9046.80s]  do the thing you like grab my head and smash my head into the pizza yeah and
[9046.84s -> 9051.90s]  like it like like a cake and to be clear I'm not doing Detroit style I'm not like
[9051.90s -> 9055.42s]  Connecticut whatever you're I'm doing cat style I'm doing the fucking whole
[9055.42s -> 9063.90s]  cat like made-outfit cafe type style of pizza yeah it's gonna be like you know
[9063.90s -> 9080.54s]  my own little twist all right I'm just imagining doing that to me and I'm like
[9080.54s -> 9085.58s]  look like pizza sauce all of my face and like it does like five to ten cuts in
[9085.70s -> 9089.06s]  like at that moment and you show like a close-up of somebody's face that's
[9089.06s -> 9092.58s]  looking around like oh my god and that's really really intense music is being
[9092.58s -> 9099.70s]  played like that it like reality TV music mm-hmm and then that look like it
[9099.70s -> 9102.22s]  cuts to Louie in the back he's like taking off his fucking gloves he's
[9102.22s -> 9105.46s]  throwing him down he's like I can't believe he fucking did that that fucking
[9105.46s -> 9108.46s]  piece of shit and he walks out there with that and he's in it's like now it's
[9108.46s -> 9112.09s]  time for a brawl everyone likes watching Gordon Ramsay where they do like the
[9112.09s -> 9115.49s]  Hell's Kitchen and they cook in front everyone like you know it's like oh man
[9115.57s -> 9120.01s]  this seems kind of an intense environment it's like that just every
[9120.01s -> 9123.89s]  day but like staged like is that that crazy can we get some fucking orders to
[9123.89s -> 9126.41s]  know if I'm putting onions on these motherfuckers I mean it'd be funny for
[9126.41s -> 9131.58s]  probably like ten minutes all right well then like you'll come back when you want
[9131.58s -> 9137.65s]  some more dude we would go through an elaborate thing and then it'd be like oh
[9137.65s -> 9147.81s]  shit we still have like four hours of stream you focus we will die the second
[9147.81s -> 9152.01s]  I take a steel pizza pan across the head I'm probably gonna need a few

[9160.49s -> 9165.17s]  with this up for a second or two what we have to deal with with pizzas and then

[9212.45s -> 9221.20s]  No, but you guys are ready, but you got me on a topic, and I can't I just say it's that nothing else is important
[9221.72s -> 9232.31s]  See I was up here. I wouldn't even sit in the chair anymore. I was just up here sitting in like a sofa
[9232.83s -> 9234.83s]  Let's take this one shark tank
[9234.83s -> 9241.50s]  See I was up here. I wouldn't even sit in the chair anymore. I was just up here sitting in like a sofa
[9241.50s -> 9243.50s]  I was just up here sitting in like a sofa
[9244.50s -> 9248.78s]  Let's take this one shark tank
[9248.78s -> 9256.53s]  Stop pretending
[9256.53s -> 9265.24s]  All right, we're doing sad. This is my turn to cook your turn to cook. Okay. We're doing well like things are actually gonna get played it
[9265.24s -> 9272.70s]  I hope you can handle, but I hope you can handle the incredibly difficult put lettuce on a plate dish
[9272.70s -> 9277.70s]  You're gonna be serving up you pick the hard one. Why do you I that's not my fault
[9277.70s -> 9284.14s]  The pizzas were coming out the pizzas were out, but then you were talking about a funny scenario
[9284.14s -> 9293.02s]  I'm sorry. I'll be less entertaining this one the name of the restaurant. Let us entertain you that's gonna have to change
[9293.02s -> 9313.30s]  Are we ready?
[9313.30s -> 9315.98s]  Ready for
[9315.98s -> 9326.20s]  Ready for service. I'm ready. I know what to do. I know what I'm doing. Okay, can you make a salad?
[9326.20s -> 9332.28s]  All right, so how do you want to communicate this?
[9332.28s -> 9337.58s]  I'll say one salad and I'll say tomato when it needs tomato
[9337.58s -> 9342.08s]  You really are the voices guy today. It's not me tomato tomato
[9342.08s -> 9348.08s]  Tomato tomato tomato tomato. I need a tomato. Oh, it looks like a long walk to get those tomatoes
[9348.08s -> 9351.08s]  Yeah, you hold on. I think you
[9351.08s -> 9357.94s]  Enjoy your tomato, sir. The most disgusting vegetable. I'm telling you
[9358.94s -> 9361.50s]  Wait, you don't like tomato. Neither do I
[9361.50s -> 9363.74s]  If you put tomatoes on a fucking sandwich
[9363.74s -> 9366.50s]  Why?
[9366.50s -> 9373.50s]  Can we get some grass grass? Thank you. You and I finally completely agree on something
[9374.50s -> 9376.50s]  I mean like a hundred percent agree completely
[9376.50s -> 9381.28s]  Finally after all these years we've agreed on one thing
[9381.28s -> 9384.46s]  Today I'm not a big fan of tomatoes on very much
[9384.46s -> 9387.46s]  It has no taste and it's just mushy water
[9387.46s -> 9392.46s]  Tomatoes are amazing on some things, but not honest. I don't really like it. Why you what do you why did you do that?
[9392.46s -> 9394.46s]  We need one tomato
[9394.46s -> 9396.46s]  sabotaging
[9396.46s -> 9400.95s]  And is this my fault or yours? You're gonna blame me for this?
[9400.95s -> 9402.95s]  Gonna need one tomato one salad
[9402.95s -> 9405.58s]  It would have been done already
[9406.58s -> 9410.08s]  Excuse me. Sorry. Our chef's a fucking imbecile. You'd have your food. It's not hard
[9410.58s -> 9415.43s]  Let me tell you if I touched you or pizza
[9415.93s -> 9418.36s]  You would have screamed
[9420.36s -> 9422.36s]  You would have been like
[9422.36s -> 9426.86s]  You would have screamed at me and I would have been like, oh shit. He's mad
[9426.86s -> 9429.10s]  Two tomatoes
[9429.10s -> 9437.65s]  Get out of here. I'm trying to help
[9437.65s -> 9439.65s]  Get out of the way
[9439.65s -> 9447.82s]  You just so used to being up here in the kitchen that you're like, okay
[9447.82s -> 9449.82s]  Now I'm gonna get up there and do everything. Oh
[9449.82s -> 9465.49s]  It's cuz it's slow service. You're trying to um, we need to we need to rearrange. This is a disaster. It's terrible
[9466.49s -> 9477.70s]  I will handle. I don't know good. Let's just like speed run
[9477.70s -> 9481.41s]  the starting
[9481.41s -> 9488.41s]  Yeah, I mean, honestly, there's one counter the first two three days are absolutely on it's impossible to lose
[9488.41s -> 9493.42s]  Here give me I'm gonna take the sink outside
[9494.42s -> 9502.96s]  Can you give me the plates I feel like I'm
[9503.96s -> 9512.38s]  Way too far away. Well, when my when I have clean plates, I'll just play some here for you. Okay, that makes sense
[9512.38s -> 9515.06s]  Yeah, let's try this. Let's try. Let's try a surface like this
[9515.06s -> 9520.62s]  I know people like to go out to a restaurant where like instead of watching the food being made they get to watch the like
[9520.62s -> 9525.62s]  The dish guy just clean the dishes right next to their table
[9525.62s -> 9530.62s]  I think it's like a new like thing. They're doing an ally. I have a plate. Hey one tomato
[9530.62s -> 9543.02s]  Hey one tomato
[9550.14s -> 9554.48s]  One tomato
[9554.48s -> 9584.48s]  Man, if we could just get customers in the door, I get the best salad in New York. How's this flowing for you?
[9591.79s -> 9593.79s]  That's not quite that's not an accolade
[9593.79s -> 9604.24s]  Oh, you know, I got I got the best salad in New York. I mean when you have a like a really good farm close by
[9604.24s -> 9610.25s]  You know, it's like oh since since like 19 oh since 1903 best salad
[9624.93s -> 9642.63s]  When I was really young I had my own very special methods of
[9643.81s -> 9646.07s]  cooking like
[9646.07s -> 9648.07s]  Eggo waffles, okay
[9648.07s -> 9652.31s]  All right, like, you know, like oh first you like butter it then you like put in the microwave
[9652.31s -> 9656.31s]  Then you toast it then you put in the microwaves like it's like softer and I was like man I should like when I'm older
[9656.31s -> 9657.31s]  I'll be able to open my own restaurant
[9657.31s -> 9662.31s]  I've never seen a restaurant where someone like makes you eggo waffles and eggo waffles are fucking awesome
[9662.31s -> 9669.56s]  Like you get like pop darts and other stuff like that. Do you like like real waffles the bait in a waffle maker?
[9669.56s -> 9676.69s]  Yeah, because those are you like eggo waffles. You could you know, just take the next step up
[9677.69s -> 9680.69s]  Well, I'm saying this was like I was really really young
[9685.14s -> 9690.14s]  Better than like a legitimately made Belgian waffle. I'm like making fun of your child palate
[9690.14s -> 9693.83s]  Man, you could have you could have like, you know, step it up a little kid
[9696.33s -> 9700.33s]  We were looking for a sink a counter is everything going well, we saved the money buy some big stuff later
[9700.33s -> 9706.33s]  I think reemptively get a counter because in case we don't see one later, you know, what do you like?
[9706.33s -> 9712.34s]  Yeah, I think you get another I think you get another counter in there. I like what?
[9713.65s -> 9720.89s]  So eggo waffles, what are the ones over there? It's four smaller little waffles. They're individual big waffles that oh, yeah
[9720.89s -> 9727.01s]  Yeah, what are those called? I can't remember just like minis this something though. Those are better than the regular waffles
[9727.03s -> 9730.22s]  There's those are better than regular eggo waffles
[9730.22s -> 9734.62s]  I like the the cinnamon toast eggo waffles where it's like two and they look like breads
[9734.94s -> 9739.95s]  Haven't had those in a long while here. Do you want this?
[9740.95s -> 9756.04s]  Want this want this? Oh, you need a I need plates up here. I could just yeah, I don't have plates fucking disaster
[9756.04s -> 9757.76s]  I don't have plates up here
[9757.76s -> 9759.40s]  We need to grass
[9759.40s -> 9762.10s]  There it is
[9762.14s -> 9782.72s]  There's a door in the front, you know, but I feel like that would have taken longer
[9784.18s -> 9812.65s]  Not so easy, isn't it? That's pretty easy. I want to clean this. How come I can't clean this up?
[9814.14s -> 9826.54s]  Though I don't know. It's weird. I really do feel like the difficulty hits a point for us
[9826.54s -> 9831.47s]  We're like, I think we're supposed to have a third person
[9833.23s -> 9840.24s]  Oh my god, I can't get around them. I cannot get around these people. There you go. You got it
[9856.90s -> 9858.90s]  Mm-hmm
[9861.70s -> 9865.54s]  Yeah, it's funny there's there's already a plate there for you a little funny
[9865.90s -> 9869.10s]  You think you're better than me you think cuz you're in the kitchen now, you're better than me
[9869.10s -> 9873.38s]  Oh nice tomato on a plate. We need a regular. I have it right there
[9873.38s -> 9877.90s]  Um, what's last me called out a single order by the way, I feel like
[9878.54s -> 9883.07s]  You're putting either leaves on a plate or leaves and a tomato on a plate
[9883.07s -> 9886.79s]  Do I really need to call them out when like they're sitting right there in front of you and you can see
[9887.27s -> 9894.67s]  What's that emote of mine like fucking gourmet dinner? Oh, right. That's a new sub emote. Uh
[9898.22s -> 9905.83s]  As olives and onions as a salad topping. Yeah, give it me. All right
[9905.83s -> 9907.59s]  Do you want to practice it?
[9907.59s -> 9913.85s]  In case there's like some weird thing add chopped onion or olives onto a prepared salad. I think that's all I need to know
[9914.47s -> 9916.70s]  Okay
[9916.70s -> 9918.54s]  onions or olives
[9918.54s -> 9925.79s]  Okay, so that's that okay. That's olives
[9925.79s -> 9928.64s]  I gotta get this in a let me put this in the right order though
[9928.76s -> 9933.06s]  Cuz I know I freak out if I don't lettuce
[9933.58s -> 9936.04s]  tomato
[9936.04s -> 9947.40s]  Onion olive and everything needs to be chopped. Okay, I'm good unless you want to add something we do research desk
[9948.95s -> 9952.19s]  Another actually I need I need plates or a sink up here
[9952.19s -> 9958.82s]  I would like to do the research desk successfully one time to start that and see what happens
[9958.82s -> 9963.04s]  Yeah, though you need another counter you said and fuck you not a counter
[9963.08s -> 9969.90s]  I need a I need I just need access to plates because you have to give you have to give me a plate every time
[9969.90s -> 9976.15s]  That's kind of an issue. Anything. Um
[9976.87s -> 9987.40s]  Is it yeah, give me the plates or put you maybe put them maybe put them like put them in
[9990.10s -> 9997.68s]  If you're gonna do that then might as well do you do you have enough counter space with these four and this one down here
[9997.80s -> 10006.38s]  Trust me on the plates man. Just trust me. All right plates. Okay, I trust you research desk research desk
[10006.42s -> 10015.50s]  No, we got one sink in cabinet. All right, avoid that. Wait a minute. There's a sink here
[10015.50s -> 10019.56s]  I can put us but how would you you wouldn't be able to get in here if I were to sink go over here
[10019.76s -> 10028.00s]  Corner you could block the door. Yeah, but if you block the door it turns into a counter that we can pass stuff over
[10028.04s -> 10038.06s]  It does. Yeah. Oh, that's actually better. Let's do that. That's a hundred times better
[10038.10s -> 10047.76s]  So also if I'm really in a bad situation, I can put some dirty plates here for you. Yeah, okay
[10047.76s -> 10053.43s]  All right. I am ready to start off a
[10054.19s -> 10060.59s]  Fantastic service here in slow service. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome everyone. Would you like to watch me wash some dirty dishes for you?
[10060.59s -> 10066.54s]  Oh coming right up. We need a salad with onions on it a salad with onions and
[10067.30s -> 10072.10s]  Olives I need plates trust me with the plates trust me with the plates bro
[10073.69s -> 10095.14s]  Onions and that's it and then onions and olives said yes. Okay, you don't need to chop those. Okay works
[10095.30s -> 10102.77s]  Hold oh my god, those guys eight salads and how much how dirty is that? It needs uh, it works onions olives and tomatoes
[10103.13s -> 10105.43s]  Works it works. I need plate
[10122.63s -> 10148.22s]  One grass one with everything. I got it. It's a plate one grass. Yep
[10155.66s -> 10168.09s]  Two with everything got it one plate for you. Nice moves, dude. I saw that I fucking saw that dude
[10168.09s -> 10189.86s]  I respect it. Don't take them both. I'm ready for the next one. We're gonna be ready. Yeah. Yep to grass
[10190.77s -> 10236.08s]  That's it to grass like coming up one with everything one grass one grass survey said hey, look at that
[10237.61s -> 10244.66s]  Solid service looking good. I think I can put more dirty plates up there for you
[10244.78s -> 10248.81s]  yeah, the the issue that I'm having with this setup is
[10250.44s -> 10256.39s]  The fact that there's so many ingredients that I'm gonna run out of counter space eventually
[10256.39s -> 10258.09s]  I mean, I you know, I need counters on the right
[10258.09s -> 10262.78s]  I think also I can probably just put dirty plates straight into your sink. I should do that
[10262.78s -> 10265.14s]  Yeah more often drop a dirty plate in there. I'll wash it
[10265.22s -> 10271.29s]  When does our research pay off like what what is happening? I think I'm gonna move over here, too
[10271.29s -> 10279.82s]  I want this like over here easy to get to and grab it. We got another counter, you know
[10279.82s -> 10285.34s]  Yeah, I'll take another counter right here right to the right blueprint in the filing cabinet blueprint in the filing cabinet
[10287.82s -> 10294.72s]  Blueprint in the filing cabinet. Do we put a blueprint from the ground into the filing cabinet?
[10294.72s -> 10299.04s]  Like if I put a sink in it, yeah put a blueprint into the filing cabinet. It will upgrade it
[10299.04s -> 10302.96s]  Oh my god, that would have been useful information 30 hours ago. Yeah
[10305.04s -> 10309.04s]  We can get an Omega sink out here that would be huge actually
[10309.04s -> 10319.14s]  I think this is a good counter space for me. We got sinks. We are gonna run out of plates there
[10319.14s -> 10321.02s]  We're at the extra place
[10321.02s -> 10326.83s]  I'm gonna put these in here just in case that's the just in case emergency plates
[10327.05s -> 10332.35s]  Everybody use the desk like use the desk
[10332.47s -> 10337.39s]  So I have to go over here and it's a thing that we have to actually use it to do it
[10337.41s -> 10343.40s]  We have to research it you have to interact with the research desk
[10343.68s -> 10346.12s]  Okay. All right. So that's how it's a challenge
[10346.12s -> 10356.04s]  So when if you got nothing going on stir, we have to fill this thing up during the day. Okay, he's reading
[10356.40s -> 10366.62s]  Let's go for it. Yeah, while you're preparing the first meal, I'll be on this you got it
[10366.62s -> 10382.21s]  Oh, that's all it takes. Where can I go again? Okay, that's it. Oh, I like this line you got going. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[10382.21s -> 10384.21s]  I'm ready. I won't say everything one grass
[10386.10s -> 10390.86s]  Is that actually everything or I don't see tomato. I don't know tomato one with no tomato
[10391.34s -> 10403.47s]  In all of my bad a little bit one miscommunication and you fucking die good thing I got these fucking eagle eyes
[10404.27s -> 10406.94s]  Hawk man. Why do you even need me?
[10409.97s -> 10411.97s]  Tomato olive I need some plates. I
[10413.06s -> 10415.06s]  Got you. I got you just say plates
[10415.90s -> 10420.51s]  Said you said just tomato and all
[10421.27s -> 10424.22s]  Yeah
[10424.22s -> 10449.56s]  To grass easy one grass one tomato
[10450.52s -> 10475.92s]  Look at this. Look at this. Look at us here. We're insane one with everything one with onions
[10482.64s -> 10495.37s]  Steve plate
[10495.49s -> 10511.57s]  One grass one tomato boom bingo
[10513.49s -> 10527.76s]  That worked out pretty well, yeah, that was uh, it was our best service yet. I think we're gonna get a raise
[10528.36s -> 10532.60s]  So what do we do to here? I would love
[10536.04s -> 10538.52s]  Standards aren't as important or people will wait a long time
[10539.12s -> 10550.37s]  What do you think? Um, I think exclusive I think a lot of the ones we've lost have been because someone's waiting outside
[10550.81s -> 10567.19s]  Yeah, it's true. Oof. All right, we got a lot of stuff highly flammable rug. Ooh
[10568.48s -> 10573.46s]  Painting you know a little bit of danger. We only have 70 coins though. Uh
[10581.30s -> 10592.85s]  Yeah, I think we should like think check the sink and we have to go in the filing cabinet. Oh, yeah
[10592.85s -> 10597.33s]  Yeah, a wash basin. Ooh
[10597.85s -> 10599.05s]  Oh
[10599.05s -> 10601.57s]  Washes up to four plates at once. Oh
[10602.21s -> 10607.13s]  We're on we're incredible. We just unlocked the next level. We just throw the sink away
[10607.37s -> 10610.53s]  There are that sink in here with the other the emergency plates
[10610.53s -> 10612.85s]  I don't know if you actually sell things for money or what?
[10613.73s -> 10618.95s]  Okay, I'm gonna get it. Yeah, and we pop that one out in front. Oh, hell
[10618.95s -> 10625.69s]  Yeah, four plates can go in here. Are you kidding me? You can upgrade it again. Oh, that's cool. Let's upgrade something else
[10626.29s -> 10628.41s]  What what do you use the most? Um
[10630.16s -> 10637.03s]  What can be upgraded or what are those other envelopes you got in there? I mean there is
[10640.10s -> 10642.93s]  chandelier and
[10642.93s -> 10652.47s]  Whatever this is banner. Oh, well, that was free. It says if it can be upgraded. Okay
[10652.47s -> 10663.13s]  I don't think we have anything else. I think we're good upgrade the counter. Wait
[10663.35s -> 10666.27s]  Yeah, I think we need the blueprint to put in there not the actual
[10666.99s -> 10670.67s]  So I think we could reroll blueprints then start upgrading something might be
[10671.07s -> 10675.52s]  But I don't know when you get to the stage just gives you all these random Christmas
[10675.52s -> 10682.03s]  Oh, wait, people are saying the wash basin needs water. We need to put a sink next to it. Really?
[10682.07s -> 10696.14s]  That's not a sink. We need to sink next to the sink. No, it doesn't they are just keep that sink there
[10696.14s -> 10703.56s]  There's no reason not to have that in the corner. Now put that thing back. We're back. Yeah, it's an empty space
[10703.56s -> 10709.17s]  They're like I can I can side put a plate in there. Okay. I'm good. Let's do it
[10709.17s -> 10721.84s]  Oh, good evening, sir
[10722.36s -> 10725.97s]  Oh
[10725.97s -> 10746.75s]  Salad and one with tomatoes and onions. Okay
[10748.70s -> 10750.34s]  Okay
[10750.34s -> 10769.83s]  one with onions one with everything wash wash wash wash wash wash wash grass and
[10770.47s -> 10784.63s]  tomatoes and olives grass and tomatoes and olives
[10785.23s -> 10808.82s]  And then one with everything once you're done with that and you said everything. Oh, look at that insane and they all stay there
[10809.14s -> 10834.18s]  Insane one with onions we got somebody outside you see you see yeah, you're good
[10837.63s -> 10853.04s]  One with just olives still good to grass easy easy. Very easy. Very easy to play it's coming up
[10868.74s -> 10871.10s]  Won't everything one with tomatoes and onions
[10884.19s -> 10890.72s]  How come that guy let this whole plate of food?
[10892.10s -> 10893.62s]  That was the one you made
[10893.62s -> 10901.82s]  Holding it there just saving space so I don't have to run so it's actually hard to get from this counter all the way to
[10901.82s -> 10903.82s]  The bottom right table like
[10904.14s -> 10906.14s]  It's a race against time
[10906.30s -> 10915.02s]  Slow service, but this is the best unironically that you guys have done because we're taking it slow
[10915.02s -> 10920.78s]  I think we also figured out that you can upgrade stuff that that helped a lot. I feel like that was a
[10921.94s -> 10923.94s]  very important thing to know
[10924.34s -> 10927.78s]  Allows customers to change their order. That is a death sentence
[10928.34s -> 10934.06s]  Going straight to the gulag with that one. Oh, yeah, that's terrible, but you know pumpkin pie though
[10934.10s -> 10936.10s]  I think they can change
[10936.74s -> 10938.74s]  It's just salads
[10939.14s -> 10941.58s]  It is but I want to learn a whole pie
[10941.90s -> 10954.48s]  They're gonna change it up and except for the salads all look very similar though. That's the problem. They do portioner
[10955.34s -> 10957.69s]  automatically performs
[10957.69s -> 10960.05s]  Enter on things placed in front of it. Oh
[10962.15s -> 10974.52s]  Upgrade counter and dining table. Should we make a bigger dining table or do come I would upgrade the counter and I think we could
[10977.36s -> 10989.28s]  Upgrade the counter. Yeah, I don't think we need anything else. We could even like what would we want at this point?
[10989.64s -> 10997.86s]  What are the work boots? They are pushed through things easier, which I assume is like doors. I don't really need it 60
[10998.42s -> 11005.46s]  It's too much money. You think so. Yeah, I think we're fine. It's not movement speed. It's just pushed through things easier
[11005.46s -> 11010.21s]  I think it's better if the emergency plates are here next to me. So I don't have to go all the way down
[11010.53s -> 11040.38s]  All right, cool. All right, we good. Yeah. All right. What do they want? They want dog food one with everything
[11040.38s -> 11046.86s]  I made it in that soap shop. It's all right. Slow down slow service. We're good
[11046.86s -> 11067.62s]  We're everything's fine grab those remember they can change their orders. Mm-hmm
[11068.14s -> 11077.90s]  One with olives one with onions one with olives one with onions. Yes, sir
[11078.18s -> 11104.09s]  Done with olives. I gotta take that plate out. Yeah, he changes the grass. Oh, he did change the grass that
[11104.45s -> 11106.91s]  Bastard
[11106.91s -> 11126.46s]  Let me figure out what these guys want both everything with tomatoes one with olives one with tomatoes and onions
[11126.46s -> 11140.46s]  I got the dishes one with olives and one with tomatoes and onions. Yes, sir. Yes, sir
[11149.18s -> 11159.08s]  Tomatoes and onions, right tomatoes and onions and one with olives just one with onions or olives olives olives
[11159.68s -> 11166.19s]  Go go go go go go what two onions and tomato
[11170.96s -> 11173.60s]  Do you change what I got one right here? I got one right here
[11174.08s -> 11176.08s]  What I don't even know what I did wrong
[11176.48s -> 11184.58s]  What happened you get the wrong plate? What did it happen? What happened? I I put I think I put the wrong plate or something
[11184.58s -> 11193.19s]  Down what happened? He gave them the blank plate. Oh, it all fell apart so quickly. No
[11193.79s -> 11197.76s]  We're doing so good. Oh
[11198.24s -> 11207.44s]  Fuck we unlocked medium-sized though. You forgot you left the salad on the counter
[11209.33s -> 11218.11s]  Grab an empty plate and take it to him and think I think you miss clicked. Yeah, I want I need to go again
[11218.31s -> 11227.73s]  We're like we're like right there man. I mean we have a medium place now. You want a bigger one?
[11227.73s -> 11231.97s]  Look at look at this one. This one's pretty good. Let's go back to the classic classic steak. You want to cook? Uh
[11234.07s -> 11236.80s]  Sure. Okay now that we know we can upgrade
[11237.40s -> 11248.97s]  Turns out changing the order actually kind of sucks because you have to constantly look for it
[11249.09s -> 11250.34s]  Yeah
[11250.34s -> 11253.08s]  It was really hard for me to like look and catch any of that
[11253.40s -> 11259.00s]  Especially the salad because it's like the olive sometimes blend in the onions. Yeah, that's different. That's that's hard
[11259.16s -> 11269.94s]  Okay, I don't know if you want the booking desk. Um, that's kind of hard mode. Maybe we just shouldn't do it
[11269.94s -> 11280.55s]  What's your title right now stir and I are having a breakdown. I'm having a break up truly. That's all so bad
[11280.55s -> 11284.60s]  Never mind. No, not true. Not true. You know set the tables where you want them
[11284.60s -> 11286.60s]  They're pretty spread out. Did you get them right in front here?
[11291.65s -> 11300.67s]  Dude, they could sit up here. Okay. I messed this up. They it's like they can do like bar seating
[11300.79s -> 11305.23s]  Yeah, there was like options on it too of like what it modified. Can you put it back? Oh, yeah
[11305.23s -> 11313.92s]  What was that decreased patients increased mess? So could you just awful? Could you do that's awful?
[11314.04s -> 11323.51s]  But hold on. Can you just go like right from you could probably just serve them immediately if they sit there, right?
[11323.63s -> 11329.05s]  Is that work or didn't know I don't think so, right?
[11329.05s -> 11332.91s]  It sounded like all negatives other than like how long it would take me to get to them
[11332.93s -> 11345.99s]  Then you put it on the other side. Wait, hold on swap it done. No, it does work
[11346.19s -> 11353.47s]  You have to remove the counter really so they can just come sit in the kitchen
[11355.65s -> 11359.71s]  That kind of sucks. Yeah, I don't I don't want them in my
[11360.77s -> 11362.93s]  In your space
[11362.93s -> 11370.56s]  Okay, so I'm gonna put one here and then one like we just go bang
[11373.42s -> 11383.22s]  Outdoor seating can you that's a lot of way to go though. I'm so ready
[11383.22s -> 11387.74s]  You were just like back and forth back and forth. I know cuz I'm I don't I wanted to be three and three
[11388.26s -> 11397.84s]  Okay, I believe you. Okay. I'm good. You're ready to go steak Andy
[11397.96s -> 11404.97s]  Yeah, I'm gonna have that there so you can put dishes straight in it's it's the strap. Yeah, I'm gonna go
[11412.82s -> 11414.94s]  Why are you putting stakes on immediately? They?
[11416.64s -> 11422.95s]  Okay. All right. Okay. We want a two wells all the way
[11422.99s -> 11436.68s]  I think I can handle a couple of steaks
[11444.44s -> 11448.15s]  this person wants a
[11449.51s -> 11452.97s]  rare
[11455.31s -> 11464.36s]  You made a bunch of mediums, I want you to take that on over that customer right there
[11464.36s -> 11471.66s]  Oh, yeah, why wouldn't you go back there? Do you start to talk like this? Oh
[11472.30s -> 11480.92s]  Just having a nice all-time good in my food. Just keeping calm. I had this person wants a
[11481.92s -> 11483.92s]  medium which is right there I
[11483.96s -> 11492.48s]  Think I can I grab it from here kind of you can yeah, I wish you could like take down parts of the wall for this
[11492.48s -> 11493.88s]  counter
[11493.88s -> 11496.82s]  Put this in the sink
[11497.02s -> 11500.46s]  I think we're done
[11500.48s -> 11502.48s]  One more fucking yokel
[11503.06s -> 11505.50s]  People are saying it's the wolf man voice it is
[11506.02s -> 11522.12s]  rare
[11522.12s -> 11541.82s]  Golden rare why is there steak in the sink give it a little bit extra juices. All right, we just go I think we just go
[11542.34s -> 11546.74s]  Just go just I mean, I don't we I think we just go we don't have we don't have money for anything
[11547.18s -> 11554.76s]  Get his order immediately son. That's a dangerous game. You're playing right now
[11555.52s -> 11565.75s]  Medium you see that's exactly that's not me. That's a well done. I planned it. I played it
[11568.90s -> 11570.66s]  I don't like this
[11570.66s -> 11581.44s]  Yeah, you don't like a lot of things. I see these kick up a whole bunch of grease on the floor
[11581.94s -> 11592.04s]  Are you just trying to make one of each kind of thing to have is ready?
[11592.04s -> 11596.88s]  I'm trying to make the ones that take longer first so that I can make a rare quicker
[11597.48s -> 11599.78s]  like if they come and they want like a
[11600.02s -> 11602.62s]  You know a well done and a rare
[11603.22s -> 11607.31s]  All right, so if I have a medium one, then it's you know, it's easy to go plus one
[11608.79s -> 11626.66s]  Media man rare enjoy. Sorry I peed on the ground
[11635.52s -> 11656.38s]  Rare I think that's it
[11656.62s -> 11661.56s]  Fucked up us to mine. We should not have we should not have immediately gone
[11661.60s -> 11665.44s]  We needed to put a blueprint in the research. We need to look for a research
[11665.80s -> 11667.80s]  Bumper to bump up the research
[11668.60s -> 11674.53s]  Shucks, we're gonna get their research going ASAP on one of those that that kitchen sink
[11675.57s -> 11677.57s]  revolutionary gradable plates
[11678.06s -> 11679.70s]  sharp cutlery
[11679.70s -> 11684.50s]  Place on table to have customers eat faster. Ooh, that's actually pretty good
[11684.50s -> 11689.74s]  Oh, I'm upgrading the sink. We're going for it. You need a research table
[11689.74s -> 11694.20s]  Don't you think you need the research table to actually research it?
[11694.20s -> 11697.24s]  But it looks like it's like holding that in is oh we got by the desk
[11697.44s -> 11702.58s]  Huh research desk, yeah, we're not one we don't have enough. Oh, yeah, we do. It's 40 out of 60
[11702.62s -> 11712.15s]  Okay, when we open you start researching you ready? Yeah, you got it. Let's go
[11712.27s -> 11728.33s]  Is that the room code that is the seed for this game? I guess I don't know why this seeds
[11729.37s -> 11730.81s]  rare
[11730.81s -> 11760.34s]  Rare about to make some pumpkin. Ah
[11761.14s -> 11767.78s]  They really want us to make that pumpkin pie. Hopefully these guys want mediums
[11770.42s -> 11772.42s]  rare and well, sorry
[11793.20s -> 11797.62s]  Rare too easy
[11798.38s -> 11799.46s]  dominated
[11799.46s -> 11802.14s]  one shot one kill
[11802.70s -> 11809.10s]  You do by playing overwatch. I have been a bit lately
[11809.70s -> 11811.14s]  You like it?
[11811.14s -> 11819.47s]  Yeah, is it fun? Like should I play it? Should you play it? Probably not. Okay, I
[11823.69s -> 11828.41s]  Think you should try it one probably when the PvE stuff comes out. That's a play together. That's what I'm waiting for
[11829.09s -> 11831.09s]  Is that coming at any point?
[11831.93s -> 11833.49s]  Um
[11833.49s -> 11840.45s]  Apparently like piecemealing it it might be like another like six months sometime in my life. Yeah, my goodness
[11840.45s -> 11846.50s]  It's basically like a year away. I thought that might be generous. Wasn't that like the whole selling point of
[11847.78s -> 11850.62s]  Yeah was but they realized that was taking so long that they
[11851.02s -> 11859.57s]  Said okay, we'll do multiplayer stuff and not like hold that off because that's actually kind of sort of a little done interesting
[11861.95s -> 11864.63s]  Yeah, we 20% slower sounds awful
[11864.87s -> 11868.18s]  Okay, so we should have an upgraded thing over there
[11873.74s -> 11880.84s]  What kind of psycho wants chopped tomato on their steak like you go to a nice steak restaurant, which is what we are
[11880.84s -> 11886.10s]  We're incredible. Mm-hmm to like just tomato slices
[11886.30s -> 11894.63s]  Yeah, that's kind of weird or is it like a tomato sauce tomato sauce would be kind of weird, too
[11894.63s -> 11902.63s]  Oh, we don't have the money for this so we can upgrade it again do it again. Okay. I'll start here. Um
[11904.58s -> 11914.83s]  Hold on I did the breaking bad thing where I haven't let my eyes hurt. I haven't blinked in like three hours. Okay, okay
[11921.75s -> 11927.37s]  Order up this person wants
[11928.49s -> 11930.49s]  Probably the new thing I would imagine
[11930.77s -> 11944.69s]  Nope, just a well done. Oh, yeah, I gotta keep that in mind that I might have to chop some tomatoes
[11945.05s -> 11947.96s]  Yeah, that's some dangerous cooking
[11948.48s -> 11961.02s]  these two want I love that rain sound they want a
[11962.14s -> 11964.14s]  medium with tomato and well done
[11971.26s -> 11973.26s]  You already have a medium here stir
[11978.85s -> 11984.03s]  Fuck
[11984.83s -> 11995.15s]  Doing too many things these two would like I need I need more counter space they need
[11996.15s -> 11998.15s]  medium and rare
[12010.70s -> 12019.96s]  I'm waiting you're burning. It's burning. You're burning it. I don't care what
[12021.24s -> 12025.34s]  No, give it to me. Oh
[12025.46s -> 12027.46s]  It's bad news
[12028.66s -> 12030.66s]  It's bad news
[12031.10s -> 12033.10s]  Wait, wait
[12033.14s -> 12035.14s]  Too much you cooked it too much
[12036.06s -> 12038.34s]  This is ugly. It's getting ugly over here
[12042.46s -> 12046.10s]  Everything's fine. It's savable. We just need one rare
[12048.34s -> 12052.86s]  I'm sure I'm like over complicating. I'm trying to like be maximum efficiency
[12056.63s -> 12061.33s]  You're okay. We're good. Everything's fine. I don't have to take that order yet
[12061.93s -> 12066.84s]  Yeah, this this grease ground we need like a mop as soon as we can get it
[12067.24s -> 12078.12s]  It is so hard to walk around and click on the right thing. Okay, you good to take an order
[12079.00s -> 12088.09s]  Yeah, rare rare one of them tomato. Yeah, I can't even get in the door
[12095.12s -> 12103.55s]  Why does my steak taste like soap I
[12106.00s -> 12114.52s]  Need a mop. Yeah, and if you're ever like
[12115.08s -> 12118.72s]  Really waiting for me. Let's come do that. I need a I need a clean boy
[12119.28s -> 12123.42s]  All right, I think I need to get on it earlier because you can clean the small ones quicker get him up
[12123.72s -> 12129.31s]  Off is better. I mean if we get offered one
[12129.99s -> 12131.03s]  gas
[12131.03s -> 12139.20s]  Eight more plates another counter you wanted that right and a sink you want the counter. Oh
[12141.16s -> 12149.71s]  But what's wrong? Hold on. This is a dishwasher. It's like a full dishwasher
[12149.87s -> 12159.23s]  I don't know if that's a problem. Is it it's probably better. It does it automatically. No, that's phenomenal
[12159.27s -> 12162.47s]  That means it'll do it without us even touching it automatically
[12162.47s -> 12166.11s]  I was just thinking in the case of a kitchen where I actually need sink water
[12166.11s -> 12170.05s]  But I guess you know, we saw the sink. Do you want the um, oh we only have 15
[12173.88s -> 12183.64s]  Yelling at us. They're saying I'm great more. Yeah, I'm upgrading something. Are you are you doing you confident? Yeah, I'm upgrading a grill
[12183.64s -> 12194.14s]  All right, I'll do the upgrade when we start is that where you want the dishwasher? Yeah, that's good. Cuz I got actually yes
[12194.90s -> 12196.46s]  Okay
[12196.46s -> 12202.47s]  Maybe it's on the left side next day because it's kind of far. We're good
[12202.47s -> 12208.94s]  Okay, taking it nice and slow cooking to order. All right. Here you are
[12211.66s -> 12213.82s]  well with tomato medium tomato, I
[12230.12s -> 12238.36s]  Desperately need another counter now we need
[12240.04s -> 12242.04s]  Rare tomato well tomato
[12242.16s -> 12266.62s]  So when you do that, I can't place the tomato now. Yeah, all right now any well tomato and then this guy
[12266.62s -> 12269.11s]  What do you want?
[12269.11s -> 12284.41s]  medium tomato
[12285.33s -> 12292.12s]  Wait with these people might want well, yeah
[12292.12s -> 12299.25s]  No, they were too medium. So we need two mediums one tomato and one rare tomato two mediums one tomato
[12299.81s -> 12307.17s]  Okay. Now I need a medium and a rare tomato
[12307.75s -> 12320.96s]  You need a plate. All right, so I need a rare tomato. Yes, darling. Oh
[12322.52s -> 12340.74s]  All right, this person wants a medium tomato and a well
[12347.65s -> 12349.95s]  This thing is amazing by the way
[12350.27s -> 12358.68s]  This thing is absolutely just cracked out. I just need a well. I think that's it for the day
[12359.40s -> 12367.11s]  All right. That was a little that got a little heavy, but we're okay. I got a little rough
[12367.11s -> 12379.89s]  I've written just one counter dude. Just one counter the plate rack next to the sink. It is it is though
[12389.13s -> 12394.71s]  Charming sure we have never actually successfully set up decorations for one of these
[12394.71s -> 12402.75s]  No, imagine going to a nice restaurant and the dishwasher is in the dining room
[12402.95s -> 12407.34s]  Oh
[12407.34s -> 12418.79s]  Dark board. We don't have enough money to do this though. Yeah, aha a danger hob
[12419.51s -> 12432.62s]  Double speed but catches fire after burning food. I can keep that we can we can get the final upgrade on that
[12433.66s -> 12438.94s]  Walllight, how do I move this? I don't want to this isn't a really stupid place
[12440.45s -> 12445.59s]  Do these blueprints get re-rolled into useful stuff cuz like really it's counter space
[12445.59s -> 12459.55s]  I don't know but the banner over the dishwasher. I gotta pick the banner up. I don't think I can I think it's just here forever
[12460.03s -> 12466.78s]  You know, yeah, that's that's annoying me. I'm actually very upset
[12466.78s -> 12470.25s]  It's pissing me off how the way this is and I can't pick it up. I hate it
[12470.25s -> 12481.25s]  I don't think I can move it. Oh, thank God. Okay
[12485.19s -> 12499.13s]  Christmas. All right. Um, I'm nervous. I'm nervous. You nervous. Hold on. I need to do it some adjustments here
[12499.17s -> 12520.82s]  Okay, I think I'm okay. Hold on. I want this not quite against that
[12520.82s -> 12524.53s]  Okay, I am
[12524.69s -> 12533.76s]  Plate rack plate. I didn't press it plate somebody saying plate rack plate rack plate rack plate rack. What about it?
[12533.76s -> 12538.92s]  What are they what? I don't know we're being yelled at what happened plate rack plate rack move the plate rack move the plate rack
[12538.92s -> 12546.69s]  Why I don't know they're just yelling it plate rack swap with the sink swap the sink with the plate rack
[12546.69s -> 12553.43s]  Oh, yeah, you know, it's because I the dishwasher is over here and I can just put the clean plates onto the dish
[12553.43s -> 12557.14s]  Okay, I get it. Yeah, you guys are right. That's true
[12557.18s -> 12563.09s]  You're calling me how to telling me how to run my kitchen like telling me how to raise my kids
[12563.21s -> 12571.32s]  Hey, how do you feel? You all right? This is the big one is we have to get past this hump. Sure
[12571.32s -> 12574.38s]  I remember a research in the beginning. Oh, yep
[12579.17s -> 12588.72s]  There's nothing to research. Oh, I guess it's maxed out. All right. This person is coming in
[12588.72s -> 12592.48s]  They want a nice delicious steak and they want it to be
[12593.32s -> 12601.59s]  Medium just medium nothing else. Nice work
[12605.58s -> 12608.10s]  Hey open, what does it think?
[12608.90s -> 12611.58s]  Shit, there's nothing in there. This person wants a
[12612.38s -> 12625.12s]  Yeah, well with an onion with a tomato. Okay, I'll give an onion well with a tomato. No tomato. There we go
[12627.88s -> 12647.55s]  This person wants oh my god get out this bad well with tomato this person wants well with tomato
[12650.00s -> 12653.07s]  Wow, how original?
[12653.99s -> 12673.18s]  Good
[12673.22s -> 12688.81s]  Medium only got them service up clean it. What are you doing? You're fucking idiot. What's happening to my guy?
[12688.85s -> 12690.85s]  You won't clean it that
[12691.37s -> 12706.46s]  My life rare medium both tomato. I fucking stopped that move that plate
[12708.18s -> 12713.38s]  You cannot do that you need more counters put the plates with the plates
[12713.38s -> 12720.58s]  There's a plate stack you need more counters. That does not fix the idea that you need more counters. I do need more counters
[12721.89s -> 12723.89s]  We agree oops
[12727.21s -> 12741.93s]  Two wells one with a tomato, where's my plate? Where'd you take my plate? They're all stacked up
[12741.93s -> 12747.24s]  You told me not to do that anymore. Yeah, but I set the plate there at that time on purpose. Hey, but you
[12748.76s -> 12752.16s]  We talked about okay didn't okay. I you don't think I know what I'm doing over here
[12755.50s -> 12764.13s]  That's the 300th Boston accent this stream. Oh dude this guy from the East Coast or something. I don't know
[12768.70s -> 12777.16s]  Um bone in steak serve with the bone which must be thrown away after yeah
[12777.16s -> 12787.43s]  I just gotta move bone and steak which I need to figure out like if I need to do something special for that
[12787.43s -> 12797.83s]  Yeah, remove. I think I have to do that. I think I have to take the bone out remove bone before cleaning
[12798.07s -> 12801.63s]  So give me the trash because I have to do that here
[12801.63s -> 12816.22s]  Oh, no, I have to like it's a whole separate cut of meat. We we need a counter gas limiter
[12816.50s -> 12824.61s]  No counter. All right, dude. Okay. Well, I'm gonna buy the extra hub
[12825.09s -> 12836.17s]  And I can use that as a pretend counter take out the upgrade is the one in there. Yeah, I got it
[12836.17s -> 12845.24s]  Oh, you got it already. Okay. Let's upgrade the plate stack or maybe the gas limiter because this is super dependent
[12845.32s -> 12855.07s]  What does the gas limiter do 70 burn 75% slower?
[12858.44s -> 12863.61s]  Burn slower but cook slower. Oh
[12864.25s -> 12874.25s]  Burning has not been a problem at all. I think the entire time we've been playing how much money do we have?
[12874.49s -> 12879.60s]  25 we can get these breadsticks, but I don't know how they work
[12879.72s -> 12882.98s]  It kind of I tried to use them it kind of like a detriment
[12882.98s -> 12895.76s]  I think we do you put the plates or plates in the research. Yeah, okay
[12895.76s -> 12901.10s]  I'm ready. You ready to go for bone in I'm ready to bone
[12901.10s -> 12907.59s]  Oh see you need to throw the bone away then I need to throw them. Oh the garbage we did
[12909.11s -> 12912.41s]  That's GG fuck that's GG. What does he want?
[12912.45s -> 12917.37s]  Also got a weight for them now in case they want bone in her steak
[12917.37s -> 12929.62s]  This is a rare tomato. Look at that. Look at that cook speed. Boom tomato. Just testing you
[12939.79s -> 12945.72s]  medium tomato
[12945.72s -> 12956.80s]  That is so convenient. We don't even need all these burners now. It's just way faster. Yeah, I need to move those plates
[12956.80s -> 12958.80s]  I like to have the the middle open
[12960.04s -> 12966.44s]  they want
[12966.88s -> 12968.88s]  They went well and then rare tomato
[12969.44s -> 12976.85s]  Look at that. That's so much better. Well, you have to be on top of that though
[12976.85s -> 12994.44s]  You get that convert I can like fuck it up so quickly the bone in not very popular. Hey
[12997.45s -> 13006.58s]  Rare tomato well done the plate down, please
[13007.86s -> 13009.86s]  Put the plate down, please sir. Ah
[13011.33s -> 13015.09s]  Fucking I fucked it up. I fucked it up. I fucked it up. Yeah. No, we're good. We're good. We're good
[13015.73s -> 13029.86s]  Great tomato thought it was the other way around. We're good. This person wants a bone in tomato and that I that looks like medium
[13030.46s -> 13043.70s]  Medium bone in with tomato. There we go. Sir. I'll take this order
[13044.22s -> 13050.92s]  Good good. Oh
[13051.04s -> 13062.08s]  Trash you gotta throw that away. I can't go in here until it's thrown away. Yeah, that's I
[13062.84s -> 13066.40s]  Need that over here. So hopefully we make it through this good that they didn't order
[13067.76s -> 13072.40s]  That would have been so awful. And then how do we take the trash out because the trash fills up?
[13072.44s -> 13074.44s]  We need a well tomato. I
[13076.83s -> 13078.83s]  This trash outside I can do that
[13078.87s -> 13083.10s]  Alright, we're good. We made it
[13083.10s -> 13088.06s]  Yeah, I can't even dump a second one. Yeah, we just have to move that next time. We're good
[13088.60s -> 13094.28s]  They bone into mate. Yeah, I like the way that it rings
[13094.84s -> 13102.21s]  Okay, cool. Alright, so priority number one. I need the trash in here
[13110.76s -> 13113.61s]  auto plater
[13113.61s -> 13117.74s]  conveyor oh
[13117.74s -> 13122.28s]  Finally a counter didn't you want another one? I don't understand this one
[13122.28s -> 13136.08s]  It says automatically plates anything placed in front of it. I don't know we pick up the tonight pick the trash up
[13136.84s -> 13149.38s]  Okay, that solves literally every problem
[13149.74s -> 13158.93s]  What we did upgrade the plates? Uh, they need to upgrade again again. I was looking at let them let them cook a little longer. Um
[13160.44s -> 13167.64s]  I mean, I think we're good if you got the trash out there. Oh wait, that's another counter
[13167.64s -> 13185.29s]  We're taking with countertop countertop countertop. I think I'm gonna put this up. Yeah, like right there. Okay
[13187.18s -> 13191.10s]  Do I need I need to upgrade this right? Yep. Let's go
[13192.26s -> 13195.62s]  No, and I'll be up wait what it cannot
[13196.14s -> 13203.26s]  Okay, then I don't really understand what it does. I think some things can only be operated once
[13203.26s -> 13207.32s]  I mean, I don't understand what the auto plater does in general. Oh
[13208.08s -> 13211.53s]  All right rare, you know
[13222.26s -> 13224.26s]  upgrade this I
[13224.34s -> 13230.80s]  Think this this grill also doesn't make grease all over the ground
[13231.52s -> 13232.56s]  medium
[13232.56s -> 13242.66s]  Things got infinitely easier. I could see where that would be hard to use though because it just happens so quickly
[13243.18s -> 13255.32s]  All right, we got
[13255.36s -> 13259.54s]  Bone rare bone in rare with a rare bone in tomato rare

[13387.00s -> 13394.58s]  We're good. We're good. That was uh
[13395.26s -> 13397.88s]  That was scary. Okay

[13401.18s -> 13407.56s]  Incoming this shits full again. The trash is fucking full. Yeah, it fills after one
[13407.56s -> 13414.87s]  I think it's two. I don't know about that there buck. Oh, all right. These guys. All right, we need a
[13415.47s -> 13417.47s]  bone in bone in bone in
[13418.27s -> 13420.47s]  Bone in rare with tomato bone in well
[13421.07s -> 13430.93s]  Man, if my guy could just learn how to take this thing off of a plate
[13431.61s -> 13435.07s]  That's too much
[13435.96s -> 13440.40s]  That's not rare that this is well. Oh, no. No, you're good. Yes. All right. I thought I was looking at one stop
[13440.40s -> 13443.91s]  All right. Well rare needs a trail. Yeah, the color of those is uh
[13445.19s -> 13447.78s]  Weird we're good. We did it
[13448.60s -> 13460.22s]  Okay, can you can you upgrade the trash? I don't think there's a trash blueprint. This is the furthest we've ever been
[13460.22s -> 13464.54s]  I think you should put the trash near the door so you can take it out easier. Yeah, it's gonna do
[13464.82s -> 13475.08s]  It's like right next to the door. What if I just told me at all?
[13475.56s -> 13485.49s]  Why would you want to tomato things? I don't know. Maybe you can upgrade it. Yeah, looks like you can
[13486.01s -> 13490.29s]  He knows if you can actually Oh meat more meat. Yeah. Oh
[13490.99s -> 13499.74s]  Oh, they don't like that, okay, they don't want to sit next to like the smelly trash, okay
[13499.74s -> 13504.73s]  All right, we're good
[13504.73s -> 13510.78s]  Yeah, this I what I need an explanation what this auto plater does because you like auto plates
[13510.78s -> 13518.30s]  What if I put something on it's already going on the plate? Um, let's see if anybody in chat tells us what on twitch integration
[13518.62s -> 13526.03s]  It it's not happening right now. Not tonight. It's this you're gonna like open up a page log in like link do a link
[13526.97s -> 13528.97s]  Activate it. Oh, I get it
[13528.97s -> 13534.28s]  It's for like if you have the conveyor belts
[13534.40s -> 13543.06s]  Then it would like you'd conveyor belt a plate down in front of the auto plater, but we don't have conveyor belt
[13546.26s -> 13552.27s]  We have a hundred dollars. There's nothing else here. We need not really we could upgrade something. Is that a counter?
[13554.41s -> 13560.36s]  That is a counter here darling. We could reroll. I'm gonna upgrade this counter
[13560.36s -> 13567.38s]  We don't want to reroll the tomatoes. Uh, no, I just want to like ten bucks. Wait, hold on. Let me make the counter. Sure
[13567.42s -> 13575.58s]  That's my shirt. That's an Andy mark shirt do it. We need a Andy mark a mop would be nice still
[13575.78s -> 13585.19s]  That's what I'm saying. We should just reroll reroll. You're out there. Let's reroll scrubbing brush
[13585.51s -> 13589.78s]  Wipe the floor scrub the dishes don't think too much
[13589.78s -> 13597.91s]  So hold this to do floor two times faster on floor messes and scrub is three times faster on something wellies
[13597.91s -> 13610.66s]  I think this makes a huge mess, but you don't care about the mess anymore and then another dish rack
[13610.66s -> 13615.94s]  I think we're ready. What about the dish right? Yes
[13616.46s -> 13617.94s]  Yeah
[13617.94s -> 13626.63s]  No, let's go. We are wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, maybe the dish rack
[13626.63s -> 13632.99s]  We're we're like we're limited we can clean plates quickly, but we have a stack of four for this whole fucking place
[13632.99s -> 13649.55s]  All right, let's get it here. I'll pass it to you the wall. No, I won't. Well, what was that?
[13649.55s -> 13654.95s]  Why does it look so different? Wait, there's no dishes. It's a dish rack
[13654.95s -> 13662.91s]  Oh, so you can put dishes in the dish rack, but who cares right now?
[13663.27s -> 13674.20s]  Wait you go away. Wait, what is it? Yeah, who cares? It's for dirty plates, but I don't get it
[13674.20s -> 13680.23s]  All right. Well like that here. We'll just put that in the we have so much money. We're so wealthy
[13680.23s -> 13684.31s]  We're so well off but what I mean even matter it's for dirty plates
[13684.31s -> 13693.27s]  Yeah, but what does that do that doesn't we don't have whatever. Yeah
[13693.27s -> 13702.05s]  I guess if the dishwasher is currently running and I could put some in there better you want the wellies
[13702.09s -> 13709.32s]  What do they do you make a huge mess but your character does not care you you never oh, yes
[13709.32s -> 13711.32s]  You should put those on up there. Yeah
[13711.88s -> 13717.90s]  Put them in here just the same space and I'll put them on will you play putting them over there?
[13717.98s -> 13732.71s]  No, what you're doing my wellies stop. Okay, let's go can't upgrade you better plus to that. What's up? Okay, here we go
[13732.71s -> 13739.65s]  Oh, they're still hungry. They're conjoined into one person. I thought I was one person. I'm gonna hate you both
[13739.65s -> 13747.00s]  No, you don't. All right. We need two double well bone ins. We have four plates. I think this is it
[13748.34s -> 13761.76s]  Four plates. Yeah, I don't like it's not done
[13765.88s -> 13769.58s]  My god, oh my oh my
[13770.44s -> 13778.80s]  I'm like I'm like colorblind to them. I know that's it
[13779.54s -> 13782.34s]  The bone ins are a little there look a little finicky
[13782.50s -> 13789.74s]  No, like like like phase one is the same color as phase three fucking
[13790.50s -> 13800.18s]  Fucking hell man. Hey, we got a new stuff. There's a colorblind mode
[13800.18s -> 13802.54s]  It puts a letter next to the meat. Really?
[13802.54s -> 13808.88s]  I would I would not have made like any mistakes at all ever ever in my life
[13809.16s -> 13816.32s]  Does it letters inside looking? Where is it? Oh accessibility? Oh
[13819.23s -> 13827.49s]  That's that's big that's actually a huge deal. Let me cook these pizzas. Let's let's get a let's get a pizza run
[13827.61s -> 13830.30s]  You want to do pizza run?
[13830.30s -> 13839.09s]  Maybe a medium floor plan with a pizza would be huge. I don't really care about the floor plan
[13841.16s -> 13845.88s]  I'm just the pizza god. We need to get to day 15
[13845.88s -> 13852.68s]  First of all, I don't think we need to first beat this place the garage items in the loading bay
[13852.68s -> 13862.40s]  Oh, we did get garage items. Where are they? Are those the garage? I was wondering about that. Like nothing is really explained. Oh
[13864.52s -> 13873.50s]  We get to start with a wash basin. We get to start with this stuff. Whatever we put whatever two things we bring in here
[13880.36s -> 13886.28s]  Fucking hard mode butts candles for patients
[13888.03s -> 13897.11s]  Yeah, we restart from the beginning. It's a cooking cooking a rogue like extra life. You're going the whole way
[13897.11s -> 13910.35s]  Oh, that's actually pretty big deal. That's great. That's actually really helpful. I'm good to go. What you doing a small one
[13910.47s -> 13916.54s]  What's I can't tell which one's big? I think the long one here is in wait
[13916.54s -> 13926.06s]  Do we even have a medium and you only do pizza on small or is it wrong?
[13926.06s -> 13929.02s]  These are the three we were offered. There's like a whole bunch of them
[13929.02s -> 13936.09s]  It's probably random. I'll just pick the one you like if it says plus upgradeable on the blueprint
[13936.09s -> 13948.48s]  See if it says it it does not on this one. But yeah, well we have um, we also have upgrade kits
[13948.64s -> 13957.20s]  Should we replace the extra life? I think that would make us start with a dishwasher upgrade at up
[13957.20s -> 13980.22s]  Wait, hold on. Once you level up you can do any seed but for now, it's mid ones. Okay upgrade the sink. Wait, so
[13981.02s -> 13991.84s]  Mean like wait a minute. I didn't even realize you could walk through there. How is this? Oh, okay
[13991.92s -> 14002.48s]  Wait, what did that do just wash? Oh, we start dude. It starts with the dishwasher. Okay, what happened to the other thing?
[14002.48s -> 14016.54s]  Uh, it used it consumed it we can do it again with an upgrade yet. You want it again? Yeah. Yeah
[14017.29s -> 14023.81s]  What is better than a dishwasher? I don't know. What is it dude? It's an assault rifle soaking
[14025.77s -> 14034.64s]  Washes dishes but cannot provide water for recipes. So it's just like a soap a super sink. All right
[14034.64s -> 14041.47s]  I am I am about to make every pizza. I actually could I could what time is that?
[14041.47s -> 14052.44s]  I want to order a pizza. Somebody said that thing sucks. Uh-huh. Okay good. You're gonna get a pizza. No, it's too late
[14052.58s -> 14069.53s]  Wait, this is throwing it away. Okay, that extra life has to be inside. So so
[14070.17s -> 14082.40s]  Soaking sink is this thing this thing suck. How is this better than dishwasher? I don't know. We'll find out do this IRL
[14082.40s -> 14090.45s]  All right, you did it. That's kind of fun
[14096.03s -> 14117.24s]  This turns back up
[14117.24s -> 14125.44s]  I'll keep it where it was should you have this sink over there or should I have it over here?
[14125.44s -> 14130.54s]  I feel like it's gonna be a mess. It's not a dishwasher. It's just soaking sink
[14131.48s -> 14136.28s]  Let's do what we did in the other one and put it like in the middle there so that we can all just dump dishes
[14136.28s -> 14139.28s]  Into that. Yeah, can you put the
[14140.65s -> 14148.69s]  No, that'd be hard. Okay. No, if you put the dish rack like over here so I can um, but clean dishes
[14148.69s -> 14153.83s]  Oh, no, actually, you can just take them out. Can you the booking desk is free? Yeah, but isn't it make it harder
[14153.83s -> 14163.18s]  I think it would help early on because then you can make more money if you can just like serve more people in a day
[14163.18s -> 14182.55s]  Yeah, let's just put it up here. Okay. It's a what is happening. I don't know. Oh my hand was oh
[14186.90s -> 14199.37s]  That's in a bad spot. She's pizza. She really forgot how to make it. That's day one. They don't fucking care
[14200.45s -> 14223.68s]  He's never coming back. Oh, yeah more than one person our kitchen needs a little work. It does
[14224.00s -> 14229.60s]  Are you dizzy? No, I'm good. Oh, hold on
[14230.08s -> 14241.92s]  You can just stand there with that food and you can wait how many plates can go in the sink?
[14242.16s -> 14249.58s]  It ain't just one right? It should be at least four. It's
[14250.18s -> 14252.38s]  Ottawa I'd like this one. It's one
[14253.06s -> 14257.19s]  It's oh, I see
[14257.79s -> 14265.64s]  This is awful. It's one that okay the dishwasher can have up to four
[14266.08s -> 14271.20s]  Why can this only have one that was underwater by the way the tier two one can have?
[14271.76s -> 14274.60s]  Four in it when you wash them all at once, but you have to do it manually
[14275.24s -> 14282.68s]  It's just faster. Yeah, but I would rather have the convenience of putting more than one in
[14283.20s -> 14298.74s]  Because otherwise you just it just piles up. This thing kind of sucks
[14309.21s -> 14318.60s]  We need another sink. Let's upgrade the sink of our sink sucks are fully upgraded super sink. Okay, we need a desk then
[14338.10s -> 14352.92s]  Oh, we're missing one dollar for the research desk and the research desk itself is upgradeable weird
[14354.69s -> 14368.42s]  Interesting put the research desk in the drawer instead
[14368.42s -> 14380.18s]  I wonder what the but how would this we need a research desk to research the research desk upgrade sure do
[14380.48s -> 14394.64s]  Yeah, but you save it. We already have I mean, I don't know I think we're kind of think let's put the sink in there to save it
[14394.64s -> 14400.38s]  Ah, there's a something in there already. Are you take it out?
[14401.02s -> 14413.00s]  X. Hey, okay. All right. Let's try it. I can't believe we're going all 30 days. Good luck
[14416.22s -> 14418.22s]  I
[14418.38s -> 14443.97s]  Bet you they want a cheese pizza better not add they do put in the sink
[14443.97s -> 14471.32s]  I feel like you should move one of those counters to over here. Yeah, I agree. What do you guys want pizza? Yes, you do
[14474.11s -> 14477.29s]  Welcome to the restaurant. We can only make cheese pizzas
[14478.91s -> 14483.87s]  Pizza's good, you know what you're doing if you have a recipe and it's really great. You don't need to do anything else
[14483.91s -> 14491.92s]  Please be sure this guy wanted cheese pizza
[14493.76s -> 14516.35s]  He's just gonna pre serve every table. You don't have pepperoni. We have nothing
[14517.01s -> 14522.01s]  We only have cheese and pizza. Do you like pepperoni? I don't think I even asked you that I love
[14522.41s -> 14524.87s]  Are you a big?
[14525.67s -> 14533.07s]  Circle pepperoni soft kind of guy. Are you a small little tiny circle crispy crispy on the edges better
[14533.19s -> 14537.77s]  Okay, I'm noticing you're like crispy things I do but here's the one problem with that though
[14537.77s -> 14538.57s]  I do like it
[14538.57s -> 14545.62s]  but sometimes the pepperoni all the edges curl up and you get these pools of kind of oil in the
[14545.94s -> 14549.64s]  Middle of all the little ones it can it can
[14550.20s -> 14554.28s]  Not a huge fan of that, but it's okay if I'm in the mood for that
[14554.94s -> 14557.42s]  There's this place right here. They have really small pepperonis
[14557.42s -> 14566.30s]  I've only ordered from here like once small pepperonis and they curl up into like pods like craters on the moon for all of
[14566.30s -> 14574.25s]  The gross pizza juice to just like like miniature lakes. That's exactly what I just said. Yeah, I didn't like it
[14574.25s -> 14581.66s]  You don't like that I did not like that I felt like I was like IV dripping like pizza grease into my vein
[14581.76s -> 14587.34s]  Yeah, that's what I mean the small ones to have a tendency to do that. That's that's okay
[14587.34s -> 14594.10s]  Well, I guess I'm in like a medium like normal pepperoni cuz I know there's like the New York pizzas have those gigantic like super peps
[14594.10s -> 14599.08s]  I like just a standard a standard pepperoni. That's what that's where we're at. Yeah
[14599.28s -> 14601.64s]  Hey
[14602.20s -> 14607.40s]  Yo, that's what I'm talking about. You want to get that extra dining table or up? Let's upgrade wait
[14607.40s -> 14612.23s]  I feel like that's what was our sink situation. Oh, we know we don't actually have the research
[14612.31s -> 14621.96s]  No, we need a table. Let's get that table by that table. Didn't we have one what happened to it? We couldn't afford it
[14623.49s -> 14626.49s]  Shit, we didn't why why do we keep the sink in here?
[14627.14s -> 14632.12s]  Because we get to keep the upgrade across like you still have to buy the sink
[14632.16s -> 14637.80s]  We want a better sink, but this is the best sink and we have to live with it is not the best sink
[14638.42s -> 14642.15s]  Okay, you're right. Just reroll. We
[14643.11s -> 14650.48s]  Only have $30. All right. I forgot I named the restaurant that and I was if I got like got taken aback for a second
[14650.48s -> 14654.04s]  I have I just I I didn't even notice that
[14654.64s -> 14670.68s]  What are you gonna order? Let him do it. Let him order a little more. Oh, he wants one single water
[14670.68s -> 14682.22s]  No, I could just have a water. Okay, and yeah, you're good. I cannot cut pizza. I cannot reach it from here
[14682.22s -> 14686.82s]  I know I'm thinking wouldn't it be funny if like we had his pizza ready and we could give it to him right now
[14686.82s -> 14696.00s]  But we like made him wait and you're like sitting there at your table and you're wondering like where's my food? I
[14697.38s -> 14703.82s]  Can see that there's a pizza back there. I'm telling you right now. I I do not like this whole setup
[14703.82s -> 14707.52s]  I hate it. This is absolutely hate it. This is ending at
[14708.16s -> 14710.59s]  day like six
[14710.59s -> 14729.39s]  Space is so important and we just don't have any
[14729.91s -> 14744.90s]  Especially with all the plates, but we will make it. What are we gonna do about it complain over and over again until
[14745.42s -> 14752.70s]  We decide to stop playing. I was looking for like a practical. How do we arrange this?
[14753.18s -> 14758.35s]  If the sink is the problem
[14758.67s -> 14763.66s]  Mm-hmm chips messes are created in a well, that's awful
[14763.94s -> 14769.68s]  Let's go to make but because you have to make these I'm the chef
[14770.24s -> 14778.03s]  Pizza and chips chopped potatoes and oh you have to actually cook them you can just empty like a bag of
[14778.39s -> 14787.18s]  Lays or something into like a like a bowl. What am I cooking them in? Hey, here we go research oven research desk
[14787.46s -> 14800.44s]  Alright, the sink is in here right now. Yeah, is it like chips like oh chips or is it right?
[14800.44s -> 14810.00s]  Like potato chips potato chips, so it's potato chips not chips like fries not not chocolate chips
[14810.24s -> 14815.38s]  It's crisps is it crisps or chips it is for I don't know man. I think this is an English game
[14815.46s -> 14819.56s]  Yes, I'm I putting it in the oven. I'm just taking potatoes and putting them in the oven
[14819.56s -> 14825.40s]  I'm chopping potatoes and ovening them. I guess okay, then I am
[14826.04s -> 14829.68s]  ready
[14829.68s -> 14856.59s]  Research we want the sink in there, right? I like I like that word crisps crisps. He wants pizza and crisps Betty does
[14872.61s -> 14878.91s]  Don't hope you don't want chips. Oh he does it's a baked potato
[14879.23s -> 14887.27s]  Sorry, we forgot to cut your fries and we baked the whole potato. Here you go
[14903.21s -> 14907.27s]  We want one cheese one cheese and crying fries

[15020.50s -> 15028.38s]  There I saw this meme video like this tick-tock video one time this lady
[15028.82s -> 15034.10s]  He was she was at a restaurant back in the kitchen. She was balancing for somebody
[15034.10s -> 15037.90s]  she was trying to hold five different old dinners and she was
[15038.66s -> 15040.66s]  balancing them on a trash can and
[15041.06s -> 15045.61s]  She moved a little too much in five full plates of dinner
[15045.93s -> 15048.29s]  Just went to right into the trash
[15049.22s -> 15056.57s]  It's awful. It's such a sad video every single one goes in the trash and she just goes
[15058.21s -> 15060.21s]  It I feel it
[15061.69s -> 15071.31s]  We're gonna upgrade that sink again power. What does it wait power sink?
[15071.31s -> 15078.83s]  I don't know speed but cannot provide water power jet. We put it in there again
[15079.07s -> 15086.42s]  Yeah, well that thing cook will it turn into a dishwasher eventually and can we I think the next one is the dishwasher
[15087.26s -> 15095.73s]  Did you get the work boots? I didn't I might want to buy the plates and buying the plates
[15095.93s -> 15105.58s]  I'm gonna say this clip pizza eviscerated it. I didn't even see you do it
[15106.62s -> 15111.02s]  It was such a clean like I want that to step through the step five ready to put it boom

[15136.65s -> 15147.78s]  So you guys can relate? I am ready ready. Come on
[15160.22s -> 15163.30s]  They want pizza. I
[15163.66s -> 15170.66s]  Don't know why it's funny, but I like the way you said it. It sounded like disappointed
[15170.66s -> 15179.09s]  Oh, they're pizza and they just order something else. This can't what anything else burger or something
[15179.61s -> 15215.74s]  Pizza pizza only pizza ever another day another pizza pizza. I can't reach that one. It's common
[15215.82s -> 15227.84s]  Can you please tell them our company slogan I said
[15227.84s -> 15232.16s]  Can you think you could use your influence to get Costco to bring back the pizza combo?
[15232.20s -> 15239.19s]  Can you talk? Can you take the order? Oh, you don't even have to you don't even have to wash
[15241.11s -> 15243.54s]  We need one cheese one cheese and fry
[15247.28s -> 15256.39s]  Influence order up the influence that I would have on a company like Costco is your equivalent of me
[15256.99s -> 15266.14s]  Like showing up with like three people and we're all in like clown outfits, it's I don't not very much
[15266.38s -> 15272.72s]  You're just ignoring customers. I'm doing a funny little bit man. You're like on your phone
[15272.72s -> 15277.40s]  There's a customer right next to you and he like knows you can serve him and he's just like side-eyeing you and you're like
[15278.40s -> 15281.36s]  Watching like a tick-tock. I mean we would get the attention, right?
[15281.36s -> 15287.56s]  Like if three people in clown costumes had a meeting with the Costco representatives, it would be like oh we would get there
[15287.56s -> 15291.56s]  It would be like attention-grabbing, but they'd be like, okay and I'll get the fuck out of here you you clown
[15292.36s -> 15305.75s]  Take their order already take their order guys. They're ordering pizza. He knows what to make
[15306.71s -> 15311.56s]  What am I doing? There's too many plates in that rack
[15312.28s -> 15323.51s]  Looks like we got three left over if you want to share a bite go my pie
[15324.19s -> 15329.71s]  Again, you're back there and you're just being a weird guy. I'm the I'll be a weird guy no matter where I am
[15329.83s -> 15331.83s]  All right affordable or charming
[15332.15s -> 15334.45s]  Again, we have never done one of these
[15334.97s -> 15341.56s]  So what okay affordable focus to serve as quickly as possible
[15342.20s -> 15344.68s]  So eventually they have decreased eating time
[15345.20s -> 15353.15s]  Haves the time but no, what'd you pick? You picked the right one? You were already on the right? Oh, I was reading
[15353.15s -> 15358.52s]  Oh sure you were water basin a water
[15359.00s -> 15363.20s]  Basin you want the water base when you want to wait again for the washer
[15363.20s -> 15368.64s]  I like the water basin the water basin. I think is immediate, but what do we do with the super sink?
[15370.28s -> 15380.09s]  Um, it's like in here in case like something no the trash is causing customers to be upset
[15380.09s -> 15385.30s]  I think yeah, it can't be up here. Is it? Yep. See they look at the stinky fish thing
[15385.30s -> 15394.64s]  Oh, we lose a money dog. Okay, so it's gotta have to be somewhere up here. Yeah, put in

[15423.64s -> 15437.65s]  Hate that more than anything. You can use a barrel as a counter when we need money. He spent it all. Can you I think so?
[15437.77s -> 15452.64s]  That's awesome. Then cuz it counts as a decoration. Okay, let's go. We got no money. We're poor. We're good art making the dough

[15497.90s -> 15519.88s]  Hey, can we have someone handle that customer the way on the left someone handle that guy? You see I am working
[15519.88s -> 15527.71s]  Okay, I just hate to see a customer neglect it at the fuck you customer leave pizzeria
[15528.19s -> 15576.40s]  Fuck you customer leave put a nice place need a slice. I can't reach it need a slice on here. No
[15577.20s -> 15585.04s]  I need a fry. I blew it. It's over. I fucked everything up. I it's over. It might not be put it on there
[15588.00s -> 15603.53s]  Thanks for coming and make sure to give us a nice review on Google. Yeah, this saw this center this sucks
[15603.61s -> 15613.71s]  We're still fine, man
[15613.75s -> 15616.66s]  It's a good thing I have cat like reflexes
[15620.59s -> 15625.24s]  When he said guys move everything to the left, please
[15628.18s -> 15636.43s]  On us to maximum group size. Let's do that. That's kind of interesting 200
[15636.43s -> 15642.88s]  It's it's better reward to and I think that's actually easier. So not that I know what experience well when you make a big pizza
[15642.88s -> 15648.08s]  It's because we're doing pizza. So that's actually here and no we're making the same amount of pizzas
[15648.08s -> 15654.14s]  And let's like four dudes want fries then I'm like then we're fucked. Yeah, but I mean you make one whole pizza
[15654.14s -> 15663.72s]  That's a whole table. How many slices it or five or four or it's been four provides oil oil
[15664.04s -> 15684.13s]  You could oil me up. I left the call. Okay. I
[15687.37s -> 15699.33s]  Wonder what the oil does and that makes sense that it's one for a plate and one for washing
[15699.33s -> 15704.57s]  Yes, I think everything you just said for the last few minutes. I completely agree with great
[15704.69s -> 15723.68s]  That's all that I asked. It's all that I asked. Are we good? Wait, what about an upgrade upgrade?
[15724.36s -> 15733.02s]  Everyone okay increases movement and prevents spills. We can upgrade this upgrade that I wonder what that does. Okay, let's go

[16185.03s -> 16208.94s]  this barrel scenario pizza pizza pizza fry what I'm gonna fry see to fry the
[16208.94s -> 16214.08s]  barrel pizza is really like if you go to a restaurant the most disgusting thing I
[16214.08s -> 16218.52s]  can think of is like there's food already prepared on random decor and
[16218.52s -> 16223.00s]  they just it's already played it like oh you ordered that good we had one ready
[16223.00s -> 16228.08s]  yeah do you eat it isn't that kind of what fast food restaurants do though
[16228.08s -> 16231.08s]  they make it and they put it under the warming lights I said just sit in there
[16231.08s -> 16234.60s]  for some difference in like these are warming lights we designed it for the
[16234.60s -> 16241.59s]  situation and it's on the barrel when he double pizza double fry yeah it's not
[16241.59s -> 16245.07s]  under a warming light it's just on it'd be like if it was just on the counter
[16245.07s -> 16253.08s]  it's true fucking I hate this thing what is that I'm in a situation what did you
[16253.08s -> 16256.64s]  just like the chart I'm in a situation how can I help how can I help how can I
[16256.64s -> 16265.46s]  garbage that I'm gonna help okay good good good good just need fries okay just
[16265.46s -> 16276.35s]  need and I just need another fry the pizza all right the button to open the
[16276.35s -> 16280.75s]  door and then take out the thing it's like and I fucked up and I burned it
[16280.75s -> 16289.92s]  what if the barrel is heated it's not it has like a cobweb on it that would be
[16289.92s -> 16305.18s]  dangerous somebody said this game has two buttons yeah but this it could be
[16305.18s -> 16308.18s]  either one you never know yeah you know what else what other game has two
[16308.18s -> 16325.81s]  buttons like Dark Souls dodge and swing got you there wrong oh look at that shit
[16325.81s -> 16333.88s]  what is it extortion customers pay 50% more to use our fancy table we're gonna
[16333.88s -> 16340.32s]  be millionaires how much does it cost fancy 60 I mean let's get it we need
[16340.32s -> 16343.72s]  another table we I can't we just put it on one of our taste we have already I
[16343.72s -> 16351.22s]  think it's like a whole extra table oh let's just let's get it yeah get it do
[16351.22s -> 16357.08s]  it do it do it do it do it do it you you kind of did one of the only one
[16357.08s -> 16363.92s]  person should be over here doing this you're doing it you're doing great this
[16363.92s -> 16376.16s]  is gonna be interesting I think we have to get rid of one of these no I can
[16376.16s -> 16381.57s]  swing this you can swing that I guess can I swing this you think what if you
[16381.57s -> 16386.29s]  put one of the tables in the extra room oh wait a minute I can do that wait wait
[16386.29s -> 16390.49s]  wait wait wait wait I can just put them right next with zero people can sit
[16390.49s -> 16397.97s]  here I'm saying like what if we do a secret if I can only zero people sit
[16397.97s -> 16423.76s]  here okay you come to both where the barrel is yeah I think they go to barrel
[16423.76s -> 16429.34s]  I think so I think this is okay by the larger table need it we need we need
[16429.34s -> 16433.10s]  bigger tables because expect the group sizes are for people are saying big
[16433.10s -> 16443.60s]  portion are people people are also saying the fancy table should have four
[16443.60s -> 16450.22s]  yeah because it's the fancy table and they pay more money but what would the
[16450.22s -> 16457.90s]  portion are due for us hey I think this is okay the barrel back here that sounds
[16457.90s -> 16464.52s]  like a to me it slices the pizza for you it slices the pizza for you
[16464.52s -> 16472.22s]  autocuts the pizza read chat I'm trying it's a fast chat room right now I just
[16472.22s -> 16477.62s]  look so do I make this the portioner and then you can grab the pizza off of it I
[16477.62s -> 16484.12s]  don't know how it worked should we practice it yes we're pretty high we're
[16484.12s -> 16491.12s]  high I don't want to mess this up on yeah it's a portioner okay give it a try
[16491.12s -> 16499.30s]  we just make my 400th pizza today just leave pizza on the table from when they
[16499.30s -> 16504.42s]  come in unfortunately not how the game works unfortunately I do agree with you
[16504.42s -> 16523.39s]  though so well how does this work how is this any different than what it was
[16523.39s -> 16538.58s]  before isn't this just the same thing make it face a counter oh oh we gotta
[16538.58s -> 16552.15s]  restart the plates on the arrow side I think I understand I think I understand
[16552.15s -> 16573.47s]  oh okay like that I put the pizza here or the other way the way it was no no
[16573.47s -> 16583.24s]  you're the gamer I don't know I'm not a gamer I think it's like that let's try
[16583.24s -> 16603.79s]  it well don't start the day let's practice it I feel like I feel like I
[16603.79s -> 16621.80s]  can really just run my own business after this the other way it's upset why
[16621.80s -> 16628.81s]  is it upside down wait don't oh it's slicing it and then putting it there
[16628.81s -> 16643.63s]  that kind of doesn't even seem that helpful it's only cuts one at a time I
[16643.63s -> 16652.73s]  mean if we if we put it in the back I don't want to have it in the front of
[16652.73s -> 16657.64s]  the restaurant taking up the counter space so wait I'm confused what's
[16657.64s -> 16679.22s]  happening here basically exit exit wait I like wrapping my head around keyboard
[16679.22s -> 16686.02s]  looker Andy yeah I stir do you do the home row typing or do you look down at
[16686.02s -> 16689.14s]  your hands like I've never learned it was horrible to learn that it made me
[16689.14s -> 16698.66s]  like physically ill look wait wait I'm I'm like I've been playing too long I've
[16698.66s -> 16709.84s]  been up too long I'm getting mind-fucked by this really simple interaction yeah
[16709.84s -> 16715.95s]  so yeah and when you when you put your hands on the home row do you do you type
[16715.95s -> 16718.59s]  looking down at your hands or have you memorized where all the keys are you
[16718.59s -> 16723.98s]  know if you look down I don't have to look down at my hands we had type in
[16723.98s -> 16727.58s]  class in school and I was very fast typer and I enjoyed learning how to type
[16727.58s -> 16731.38s]  and being becoming a faster typer because I would play Starcraft and then
[16731.38s -> 16735.14s]  if someone typed to me in Starcraft like I can't stop for like a full minute to
[16735.14s -> 16740.70s]  type I would have to learn how to type quick that was all one sentence yeah
[16740.70s -> 16749.01s]  okay so but do you do ASDF JKL semi and do the home row or do you just know
[16749.01s -> 16753.33s]  where how do you what's your placement for your hands where are the the
[16753.33s -> 16758.01s]  freaking the knobs are on the the J and the F you put your index fingers on
[16758.01s -> 16762.26s]  those yeah like that's called see you don't call me role placement okay yeah
[16762.26s -> 16765.70s]  you don't have to look down you just know there that where that is how else
[16765.70s -> 16768.22s]  would you place your hand on a keyboard but you have a you have a mechanical
[16768.22s -> 16774.50s]  keyboard right yeah whenever I do that I feel like I get stuck moving my fingers
[16774.50s -> 16779.78s]  around I feel like I get kind of trapped in between the little divots you know
[16779.78s -> 16785.83s]  I mean like it then I press the wrong things well I don't understand your
[16785.83s -> 16789.99s]  problem because if you play Diablo 2 and you need to use your potions on one two
[16789.99s -> 16794.11s]  three four then you can also just easily go from WASD and all the buttons that
[16794.11s -> 16797.27s]  you need up to one fours and you learn how to do the numbers as well I can do
[16797.27s -> 16800.43s]  hands are always in the right spot I can do WASD without looking one two three
[16800.43s -> 16805.38s]  four space control I can do pretty much it's just needing to go to like type
[16805.38s -> 16812.63s]  words right so W1234 WASD Q ERT is everything over here right is fine I
[16812.63s -> 16821.26s]  don't need to look but the issue is going from pressing J to E to like B to
[16821.94s -> 16825.82s]  other sides of the board that's the problem that's what I mean like is it
[16825.82s -> 16830.62s]  like a brain issue or a keyboard issue it's a brain issue because I have what
[16830.62s -> 16835.96s]  I'm talking about is trying this same problem if you try and write on paper
[16835.96s -> 16844.25s]  but no I could write on I could write on paper without looking but I could you
[16844.25s -> 16847.37s]  just write my name without looking that's so you know where all the numbers
[16847.37s -> 16852.25s]  and letters are on the keyboard but when you try and form a word my fingers can't
[16852.25s -> 16858.18s]  find them because I have never locked into complete muscle memory the exact
[16858.18s -> 16862.46s]  spacing for all the letters on the keyboard can you can you boot up like
[16862.46s -> 16869.36s]  type racer comm right now I mean I would I wouldn't be able to do it I would love
[16869.36s -> 16875.23s]  to see that I would love to see you look straight ahead into the camera and not
[16875.23s -> 16884.41s]  look down at your hands and play type racer can I rain check this I'm tired I
[16884.41s -> 16891.43s]  feel like it's not that big of a deal I'm tired though I if it's gonna be
[16891.43s -> 16897.53s]  awful well isn't that what everyone wants to see let me drink like a coffee
[16897.53s -> 16905.74s]  let me eat a piece of salmon and drink a coffee like an espresso and get a full
[16905.74s -> 16915.10s]  eight hours of sleep okay okay rain check on the type racer yes don't worry
[16915.10s -> 16919.58s]  I'll tell you I will follow up on we're gonna play Elden Ring co-op anyways so I
[16919.58s -> 16924.35s]  mean you we could start with that okay I'm gonna eat a piece of salmon I want
[16924.35s -> 16928.06s]  to eat spinach and shit I want to have like an espresso and I want to have
[16928.06s -> 16933.53s]  simple eight hours sleep do you really need to rest up for this like triathlon
[16933.53s -> 16943.33s]  you're gonna run you're a coward I know you can say that they can and they are
[16943.33s -> 16949.15s]  I'm just honestly I'm just like too lazy to just minimize this winter I think
[16949.15s -> 16954.46s]  that's what's going on here but like you just it's just minimizing a game that
[16954.46s -> 16957.14s]  you're barely paying attention to at this point we're gonna lose the next
[16957.14s -> 16960.44s]  mission cuz I like started talking to you and you've had a conversation the
[16960.44s -> 16963.74s]  last one and this is the problem right what look at we're doing pretty good if
[16963.74s -> 16968.34s]  we disappear out to do it like type racer we're gonna come back we're gonna
[16968.34s -> 16971.50s]  be rusty and it's gonna be all I think it's already beyond the point where like
[16971.50s -> 16983.75s]  that's gonna happen there was just like me I'm really concerned for this next
[16983.75s -> 16988.95s]  day we're gonna be fine stop I don't know how the fuck this thing works well
[16988.95s -> 16998.34s]  why I'm using why did we buy it let's start okay it's just like me just pay
[16998.34s -> 17002.48s]  attention but we have to at least get further than we ever have I think of
[17002.48s -> 17008.27s]  us already is not yet think we have one more all right pizza pizza pizza that's
[17008.27s -> 17021.78s]  all it is your customers don't respect you I put the pizza I put the plate and
[17021.78s -> 17041.05s]  I put the plate here I guess I do I do I do it into one of these plate trays like
[17041.05s -> 17047.02s]  to make it actually helpful in any way he's dumb sad I don't know if you're
[17047.02s -> 17051.00s]  talking about me or him you're probably talking about collectively all right we

[17568.64s -> 17571.80s]  these fucks please put the portioner next to the sink before I blow a
[17571.80s -> 17579.90s]  gasket that what he said I think that I might be it's that was close enough it
[17579.90s -> 17593.23s]  was something like that okay we have a lot of things going on here rug we have
[17593.23s -> 17596.51s]  a lot of money we should put some decorations we haven't done any
[17596.51s -> 17609.13s]  upgrades what case plant put a rug down all right I'm buying a rug yeah we have
[17609.13s -> 17613.01s]  patience if we get a decorations down Christmas tree you all you want a
[17613.01s -> 17623.54s]  Christmas tree I'll buy another rug here's a highly flammable rug okay so
[17623.54s -> 17632.41s]  now we have patience increased cabinet can the rugs not go under the tables
[17632.41s -> 17650.41s]  metal table 50% less food and I think they order less but they have less
[17650.41s -> 17656.90s]  patience hmm sides are optional oh you don't have to put fries on their plate
[17656.90s -> 17664.74s]  so you could actually just not put french fries in front of them that's
[17664.74s -> 17678.76s]  actually kind of good I don't know what do you think you want to be faster you
[17678.76s -> 17691.62s]  put the sink next to the oil you can skip the rolling dough step I'm still
[17691.62s -> 17710.99s]  confused the oil in the sink yeah we don't have a normal sink anymore bro
[17710.99s -> 17718.94s]  move the portioner there's a lot of negative comments coming in to you it
[17719.02s -> 17723.66s]  was I saw someone to do like the face nice my child are saying that that's
[17723.66s -> 17729.63s]  like a glitch that's like an exploit we're getting that oh wait why what did
[17729.63s -> 17735.30s]  I say you know that email where it goes oh yeah but what's what's the problem
[17735.30s -> 17739.75s]  with me they're saying that that's too far away from the sink what's too far
[17739.75s -> 17743.83s]  away from the sink the portioner apparently that should be next to the
[17743.83s -> 17751.24s]  sink why I don't understand portioner above the barrel so it puts the puts
[17751.24s -> 17753.94s]  the pieces over so I can grab them what just happened
[17753.98s -> 17759.67s]  oh that hurt what happened to me what just happened to me it goes closer to
[17759.67s -> 17762.59s]  the barrel so then it puts the portioned food in front of me so I can
[17762.59s -> 17773.18s]  take it that they want that so I put the pizza here and it goes over and then
[17773.18s -> 17777.23s]  you get the pizza and you put the put on the plate I think that's how it works I
[17777.23s -> 17785.07s]  like bumped my headphone here and it went in my ear yes yes yes finally yes
[17785.07s -> 17790.11s]  yes that works yes but also some people said no stop sending psychic waves to
[17790.67s -> 17800.54s]  next to the sink oh my god these instructions let me read this upside
[17800.54s -> 17805.46s]  down t-shape next to sink with counter but pizza so it goes down just practice
[17805.46s -> 17809.18s]  it so we can see what this does we're way too far to have this be messed up
[17809.18s -> 17816.66s]  what does that mean what are these words what's the upside down t-shape I'm
[17816.66s -> 17853.50s]  getting a Christmas tree I feel like we were doing fine you're doing fine Chad
[17853.50s -> 17860.72s]  is just trying very hard drum up mm-hmm every pizza I make yeah it's going in
[17860.72s -> 17870.40s]  the trash why we're doing don't do that all right I'm ready I'm super happy with
[17870.40s -> 17874.68s]  what we have you it's getting over complicated by like too many cooks in
[17874.68s -> 17878.22s]  the kitchen right now there's also too many chairs in the kitchen
[17878.22s -> 17897.32s]  can we do an outside seating sure we can handle it we've handled it before all
[17897.32s -> 17900.40s]  right just go for it pizza that's all you didn't need to do your master of it
[17900.40s -> 17904.24s]  you know it you know the sauce you know the ingredients of the cheese mozzarella
[17904.24s -> 17914.42s]  I do I'm glad that I'm getting some of the fucking respect that I deserve you
[17914.42s -> 17919.62s]  got that you can plate those yeah but now I see what people mean okay well
[17919.62s -> 17930.98s]  then you're gonna have to set it up next time cuz I am dense fucking granite all
[17930.98s -> 17936.14s]  right we have another group coming in uh the soccer game just got out and here
[17936.14s -> 17939.70s]  are all those kids we need something here what do we need we need pizza we
[17939.70s -> 17960.79s]  need this is cringing is there not enough I'm just waiting for there to be

[18064.28s -> 18071.42s]  fry and this group wants you shouldn't have done that this one just pizza pizza
[18071.42s -> 18092.03s]  got that right here this is not what the bug doctor prescribed whatever happened
[18092.07s -> 18095.55s]  just good old-fashioned home cooking or like you don't have to worry about these
[18095.55s -> 18110.48s]  like conveyor belts and auto plating Alexa make me a pizza please I can't
[18110.48s -> 18123.43s]  reach that uh that is a huge knife that's actually scary I think we're
[18123.43s -> 18128.47s]  actually gonna beat this I think so too I think I hate it that whole layout I
[18128.47s -> 18132.11s]  was really happy with what it was before I was really content to just move my
[18132.11s -> 18135.82s]  pizzas around myself you get a little hands-on with the dough you can really
[18135.82s -> 18139.26s]  feel it you know it's like a rustic kind of like connection to the food now
[18139.26s -> 18147.08s]  actually put the portion of the sink make sure it's facing the right way
[18147.08s -> 18156.65s]  because now I can just go like much easier okay and then and then what if it
[18156.65s -> 18160.74s]  goes too fast and it shoots straight into the sink and that will be a funny
[18160.74s -> 18167.71s]  LOL moment because we're at the end of the game okay and what it okay here's
[18167.71s -> 18173.72s]  the legitimate serious I'm not messing around what if okay I put a pizza here
[18173.72s -> 18177.42s]  it shoots over a slice here it's shooting and it's gonna shoot a slice
[18177.42s -> 18181.38s]  that I can grab and put it on the plate immediately you you need a French fry
[18181.38s -> 18187.59s]  let's where do I where do I put where do I put the French fry that's what the
[18187.59s -> 18213.34s]  practice is for mmm you can put plates on top of the portioner ah so then would
[18213.34s -> 18222.64s]  you load it with a bunch no no okay wait wait here I just want to explain what
[18222.64s -> 18228.05s]  I'm talking about so I only grab this don't go crazy put pizza down pizza goes
[18228.05s -> 18234.36s]  onto the plate boink next piece is ready okay so now that's when when when we
[18234.36s -> 18241.94s]  need a French fry okay are you then waiting for me to put a plate down I
[18241.94s -> 18246.70s]  would need you to put the I put a plate down can you that works no that's okay
[18246.70s -> 18250.98s]  then am I making french fries to order then like if what if two french fries
[18250.98s -> 18254.46s]  are coming up and I could plate down over here you'd have to put one down
[18254.46s -> 18259.26s]  over there but sink in corner never and not on a plate just don't put it on
[18259.26s -> 18266.86s]  anything just put it just on the ground okay I'm I'm good I'm good I'm good are
[18266.86s -> 18277.99s]  you good I yeah yeah yeah go go go go go go but this is it this is a change this
[18277.99s -> 18282.87s]  is a change but you changed it I did change it what and why is this changing
[18282.87s -> 18288.27s]  again because it is you understand that it's harder for me to like go diagonal
[18288.27s -> 18292.55s]  and put stuff in the sink though why because it's like it's it's a kind of a
[18292.55s -> 18294.99s]  finicky little spot it's a tiny it's like two or three Frank it's like two
[18295.15s -> 18298.87s]  you already had to do that before to grab the plates yeah but it's so much
[18298.87s -> 18303.71s]  easier for me to scope a boom but like does this thing automatically plate
[18303.71s -> 18322.49s]  things if the plates are there I don't like it I don't like it see do you see
[18322.49s -> 18326.77s]  what's going on right now it's cuz there's a little area I'm playing on
[18326.77s -> 18332.07s]  this member I have control on an issue for me I'm playing controller so I have
[18332.07s -> 18341.24s]  like a tiny little window here let's go for it we're good rotate the potion so
[18341.24s -> 18346.82s]  it takes the pizza from above and not the right oh dude yeah what that's
[18346.82s -> 18354.23s]  exactly what should be happening cuz then no okay so you want to put the
[18354.23s -> 18360.64s]  portion or it's a yeah I get it so you can put that you can put pizzas there so
[18360.64s -> 18370.79s]  it sucks it that way okay and then I put the fries here yes no when he cooks in
[18370.79s -> 18374.83s]  the kitchen this sir please be smarter I checked out an hour ago I'm ready for

[18649.23s -> 18655.30s]  four at one point and they were sitting outside we need to have three tables of
[18658.26s -> 18671.82s]  waiting can we actually place tables outside I feel like I'm scared to add
[18671.82s -> 18678.51s]  any food no and it even says they take a lot of work yeah you cannot just remove
[18678.51s -> 18684.07s]  I'm gonna remove one of the tables and just make another four you don't have
[18684.07s -> 18694.53s]  room for three parties of four what do we do we could use that's yeah we could
[18694.53s -> 18700.05s]  use the small room you've heard the small room it has a lot of penalties I
[18700.05s -> 18707.07s]  don't think it matters anymore we have so much money it's really just like can
[18707.07s -> 18712.36s]  we finish yeah we still mean we have three levels to do so we need to make
[18712.36s -> 18718.09s]  sure we did this right we have this service thing we don't need we haven't
[18718.09s -> 18726.63s]  used this one time honestly we could get rid of the research I don't think we
[18726.63s -> 18731.15s]  know this whole room out yeah make it I'll move the freezer and everything in
[18731.15s -> 18734.95s]  the kitchen this is this is the expensive private dining area right this
[18734.95s -> 18738.07s]  is a way you just use this extra money for this table yeah that's where you go
[18738.07s -> 18746.38s]  to like really be in a kitchen room that gives me more room here too so that's
[18746.38s -> 18756.51s]  good the trash do we even use the trash really seats to oh this is a table
[18756.51s -> 18763.43s]  customers share but they eat longer because it's romantic we just use them
[18763.43s -> 18771.54s]  replace this three I think two fours like we still can have a group of two
[18771.54s -> 18777.26s]  show up I don't know if we can fit it anywhere we should put the tablecloth on

[19776.10s -> 19780.08s]  flowers because we weren't getting decorations when we want them so what
[19780.08s -> 19786.74s]  happens now what happens now is I you probably dinner I think it's just like a
[19786.74s -> 19792.82s]  new game plus so you just go keep going oh you you go as many days over time day
[19793.54s -> 19804.51s]  I'm good I'm good well that was really fun yeah I like that was intense simple
[19804.51s -> 19809.39s]  yet intense enjoyable I could okay so with two people it's kind of manageable I
[19809.39s -> 19812.79s]  think with three or four people that's where this game becomes kind of a mess I
[19812.79s -> 19817.23s]  think it's harder the more people you have well I've never played like
[19817.23s -> 19821.31s]  overcooked either which I know a lot of people really like in this genre yeah
[19821.31s -> 19824.39s]  this is this is not this one looked on simple I like the idea this because it
[19824.39s -> 19829.20s]  was like a consistent one kitchen yeah could work in but overcooked after like
[19829.20s -> 19833.16s]  I enjoyed that a lot so maybe we could try it sometime no that's cool and we'll
[19833.16s -> 19839.62s]  um we'll figure out the Elden Ring thing that sounds fun yeah and you're gonna be
[19839.62s -> 19848.02s]  playing Jade cocoon until then I mean cool I'll try to get it cool cool yeah

[20025.21s -> 20031.04s]  remind me of overcooked but it reminds me of overcooked but you know I don't
[20031.04s -> 20034.55s]  know I almost like it a little better than overcooked because overcooked is
[20034.55s -> 20039.15s]  more individual levels you know in increasing difficulty different
[20039.15s -> 20042.55s]  environments each level was a little different that felt like you were
[20042.55s -> 20050.06s]  running your own rogue like restaurant so that's fun I like it I can't imagine
[20050.06s -> 20055.34s]  doing some of the more difficult things though overcooked is fun too though and
[20055.34s -> 20061.19s]  that that firefighter game was fun as well that I didn't was in dislike that
