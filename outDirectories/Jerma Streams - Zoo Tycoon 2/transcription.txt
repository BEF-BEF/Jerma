[2.23s -> 5.11s]  Somebody said, I was waiting for you to cancel the stream because you suck.
[5.11s -> 16.82s]  Why would you wait here for me to cancel the stream?
[21.24s -> 22.60s]  Okay, hold on. How long has it been?
[23.56s -> 26.28s]  It's been 45 minutes now. Wait, hold on. Hold on. Where is he?
[26.84s -> 29.48s]  He cancelled. All right. Nice. Now I can go back to my life.
[30.12s -> 37.88s]  Oh, he's like, he's kind of late today.
[39.80s -> 41.32s]  Wow. It's been like two hours.
[42.55s -> 43.05s]  Fuck.
[47.46s -> 52.50s]  Anyways, um, wait, we got like, there's too much music going on right now.
[52.50s -> 53.62s]  I just spoiled it for you.
[54.18s -> 57.59s]  We've got a cozy stream ahead. Yeah.
[59.24s -> 65.02s]  Yeah, I feel like we've been, um, we've been hitting the gas for the last couple of weeks.
[66.25s -> 73.40s]  It might be time if just for, just for like the next couple of days to sit back and relax and play
[75.06s -> 76.42s]  one of these old fucking games.
[76.98s -> 81.05s]  It's probably going to be a very, very cozy stream.
[82.87s -> 85.96s]  Whoops. I don't want to relax.
[89.82s -> 95.96s]  Zoo. This is Zoo Tycoon 2. All the animals edition.
[95.96s -> 98.36s]  This is the ultimate edition. It has everything, every expansion.
[99.16s -> 104.07s]  I got to learn how to play. This is going to be, we're going to be like in the tutorial for like
[104.07s -> 106.63s]  30 minutes because I want to know what I'm doing.
[107.43s -> 119.10s]  Do you ever wish it was just a little bit colder?
[119.74s -> 123.11s]  Nah, I like the temperature the way it is.
[123.11s -> 127.27s]  But so let's, let's, let's break down the next week here.
[128.23s -> 134.66s]  Okay. So we've got Zoo, Zoo, Zoo Calamity 2, whatever the hell it's called.
[136.36s -> 140.44s]  Zoo Tycoon 2 for today.
[141.24s -> 149.06s]  And then if Red Dead Online works tomorrow, then I'm going to play that.
[150.26s -> 151.94s]  Or I don't know, maybe, maybe I won't.
[151.94s -> 153.62s]  Maybe I'll keep playing Zoo Tycoon 2.
[153.62s -> 159.70s]  Maybe I'll just bury my Twitch channel into the ground and play Zoo Tycoon 2 for the next like four weeks.
[162.79s -> 167.99s]  But then obviously, so we're going to go, we're going to go today, tomorrow.
[168.79s -> 172.31s]  And then I'm going to take, so that'd be Tuesday, Wednesday.
[172.31s -> 173.43s]  I'm going to take Thursday off.
[174.23s -> 178.31s]  And then I'm going to get, make sure I'm prepared Friday and Saturday.
[178.31s -> 185.06s]  Saturday is by the way, the green screen movie night is on Sunday.
[185.78s -> 189.94s]  So as of Thursday, the 29th here, you've got to get a submission.
[189.94s -> 195.30s]  And if you have a submission, make sure you read those rules.
[195.30s -> 196.34s]  It's pinned in that discord.
[196.34s -> 198.10s]  You only got another couple of days here.
[198.10s -> 204.81s]  So we got every weekend, we've had something fun to do.
[205.45s -> 206.33s]  That's what I want to do, man.
[206.33s -> 208.25s]  I want to make every fucking weekend.
[208.25s -> 209.37s]  I want to do something interesting.
[212.46s -> 213.42s]  Free shit.
[213.42s -> 214.54s]  We got free shit coming in.
[215.10s -> 220.04s]  What do you mean?
[220.04s -> 221.16s]  What do you mean free shit?
[221.16s -> 221.96s]  Where's the free shit?
[229.26s -> 230.38s]  I missed the context.
[233.11s -> 234.63s]  It was somebody just trolling.
[234.63s -> 236.63s]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[237.35s -> 241.99s]  I thought like, I thought I was in the middle of a giveaway.
[241.99s -> 242.71s]  I'm like, really?
[242.71s -> 243.59s]  What are they giving away?
[245.03s -> 245.75s]  Can I get something?
[245.75s -> 247.83s]  What do we, how do I join?
[248.63s -> 253.96s]  I want a fucking new five button mouse.
[255.96s -> 256.60s]  All right.
[256.60s -> 259.53s]  Don't get a five button mouse, by the way.
[259.53s -> 260.81s]  Just not comfortable.
[260.81s -> 262.33s]  Two is all you need.
[262.33s -> 263.69s]  Two and then the third button on top.
[263.69s -> 263.93s]  All right.
[263.93s -> 264.57s]  Let's play Zooka.
[265.29s -> 267.21s]  I can't say this fucking word.
[268.87s -> 269.59s]  The C.
[269.59s -> 270.87s]  The tycoon.
[270.87s -> 271.37s]  Zooka.
[272.63s -> 279.53s]  It's like somebody just snips a portion of my brain
[279.53s -> 282.41s]  that makes it so I can't say zoo tycoon.
[283.05s -> 283.85s]  Zoo tycoon.
[284.57s -> 285.37s]  Zoo tycoon.
[287.46s -> 288.18s]  That sounds wrong.
[288.74s -> 289.38s]  Is that correct?
[290.02s -> 291.72s]  Am I saying that word right?
[295.74s -> 296.94s]  Zoo tycoon.
[296.94s -> 300.50s]  I'm losing my mind.
[300.50s -> 300.74s]  All right.
[300.74s -> 301.14s]  Let's go.
[301.70s -> 303.19s]  Thanks for joining us.
[306.33s -> 307.05s]  Get this off.
[307.05s -> 307.85s]  And hey, look at that.
[309.13s -> 311.62s]  Here's zoo tycoon.
[311.62s -> 317.99s]  Why can't they just make it tycoon of zoo?
[324.25s -> 326.73s]  You got hit on the head too many times during the green screen.
[327.37s -> 328.78s]  Listen to that music.
[329.58s -> 330.70s]  This is old school.
[332.15s -> 333.35s]  You have to spin the world around.
[334.31s -> 335.35s]  I'm all right.
[336.89s -> 337.39s]  Whoa!
[339.88s -> 341.16s]  Does anybody think that was funny?
[341.80s -> 344.10s]  Did anybody else feel that?
[346.60s -> 346.84s]  All right.
[346.84s -> 348.12s]  Let's learn how to control the game.
[351.54s -> 351.86s]  All right.
[351.86s -> 353.70s]  That's the kind of joke you make with your son.
[355.66s -> 357.26s]  Hey, here we are.
[357.90s -> 358.94s]  Here we are, Daniel.
[360.02s -> 360.66s]  And watch that.
[360.66s -> 361.94s]  Whoa!
[361.94s -> 365.30s]  I can feel the earth moving underneath my legs, Daniel.
[366.02s -> 368.66s]  And Daniel's probably two or three years old
[368.66s -> 369.70s]  and thinks it's really happening.
[371.02s -> 371.26s]  What?
[371.26s -> 372.38s]  But dad, what happened?
[372.38s -> 374.78s]  And dad's like, I'm just kidding, Daniel.
[375.34s -> 387.27s]  Go to bed so dad can play zoo tycoon.
[387.27s -> 387.91s]  Gamer dad.
[393.30s -> 393.86s]  Fuck you, dad.
[393.86s -> 394.82s]  I want to play Fortnite.
[394.82s -> 398.34s]  Get out of here with that Fortnite shit.
[398.34s -> 399.38s]  Zoo tycoon.
[399.38s -> 404.50s]  I have 6100 hours in zoo tycoon 2, Daniel.
[404.50s -> 407.24s]  How many hours do you have in Fortnite?
[409.03s -> 411.27s]  Oh, what's that, Daniel?
[411.27s -> 412.87s]  Oh, only like 40 hours
[412.87s -> 417.62s]  because I only allow you to use the computer an hour a day.
[417.62s -> 418.34s]  Get out of here.
[424.52s -> 425.64s]  Dad's got work to do.
[429.53s -> 429.77s]  All right.
[431.05s -> 432.25s]  Learning how to control the video game.
[432.25s -> 433.61s]  Welcome to zoo tycoon.
[433.61s -> 435.69s]  I fucking can't say it.
[438.57s -> 439.69s]  Guys, you understand.
[439.69s -> 442.81s]  We're not even getting past the title of the game.
[442.81s -> 444.33s]  That's how this stream is starting.
[444.33s -> 449.42s]  I can't even get past the title.
[449.42s -> 451.42s]  In the following tutorials, you'll learn the basics
[451.42s -> 453.34s]  of how to control the camera.
[453.34s -> 455.74s]  Then you'll move on to construction techniques
[455.74s -> 457.10s]  and accessing all the information
[457.10s -> 458.14s]  available to you about your zoo.
[458.14s -> 459.18s]  Let's get started.
[459.18s -> 459.50s]  Okay.
[460.94s -> 461.26s]  All right.
[461.26s -> 464.30s]  So it's click move, open the goal panel
[464.30s -> 465.82s]  by clicking on the scenario goals button.
[465.82s -> 468.04s]  So here's scenario goals.
[468.04s -> 469.96s]  Click display information about the current goals
[469.96s -> 470.52s]  and challenges.
[470.52s -> 471.80s]  So that's the challenge button.
[472.52s -> 476.84s]  Your scenario challenge goals will fill here
[476.84s -> 478.52s]  when you play a campaign or challenge game.
[478.52s -> 480.36s]  Normally this panel will update whenever you succeed
[480.36s -> 481.88s]  or fail to complete a goal.
[481.88s -> 483.40s]  The tutorials are a little different though.
[483.40s -> 486.14s]  So for now, this is the only thing that's going to be here.
[486.14s -> 486.78s]  Cheese goal.
[486.78s -> 487.42s]  Okay.
[487.42s -> 488.38s]  Close the goal panel.
[496.46s -> 496.94s]  Great.
[496.94s -> 498.46s]  Return to the goal panel anytime you see
[498.46s -> 501.70s]  what your current goals are.
[501.70s -> 502.42s]  Easy enough.
[502.42s -> 504.49s]  Now we can learn how to move the camera around the game.
[504.49s -> 507.34s]  We'll check the button.
[507.34s -> 508.70s]  I told you this is chill.
[508.70s -> 510.22s]  This is going to be a chill stream.
[510.22s -> 511.98s]  I'm going to learn how to take care of the animals.
[511.98s -> 513.75s]  See, this is me right there.
[513.75s -> 516.30s]  Now we need to practice moving the camera around.
[516.30s -> 520.49s]  Scroll the map by using the arrow keys or WASD.
[520.49s -> 522.63s]  That's more comfortable.
[522.63s -> 523.86s]  Uh-huh.
[523.86s -> 525.46s]  And this is zoom in and zoom out.
[526.50s -> 528.34s]  You can do zoom in and it's the mouse wheel.
[528.34s -> 529.88s]  Got it.
[529.88s -> 534.47s]  Rotate the camera by pressing on the primary game button panel
[534.47s -> 536.31s]  or click and hold the left mouse while you move.
[536.31s -> 537.88s]  Look at that.
[537.88s -> 538.36s]  Okay.
[538.36s -> 539.40s]  That's that easy.
[539.40s -> 540.12s]  Guest mode.
[540.12s -> 543.40s]  Enter zoo guest mode by clicking on the zoo guest mode button.
[543.40s -> 546.62s]  Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[549.82s -> 554.90s]  This thing made me so much more excited.
[554.90s -> 556.82s]  In zoo guest mode, you can walk around your zoo
[556.82s -> 559.82s]  by pressing the left mouse button.
[559.82s -> 561.42s]  Normally when you enter zoo guest mode,
[561.42s -> 565.13s]  the mouse cursor is hidden so that your view is unobstructed.
[565.13s -> 568.01s]  To toggle your mouse cursor on and off or to view
[568.01s -> 575.62s]  or to switch to photo safari view, right click the mouse.
[575.62s -> 578.31s]  This turns into a first person game.
[578.31s -> 580.39s]  Oh man, this is going to be fun.
[580.39s -> 583.26s]  You can also take on the duties of a maintenance worker
[583.26s -> 585.74s]  to sweep trash and empty trash cans.
[585.74s -> 588.22s]  When you approach something that you can interact with,
[588.30s -> 589.66s]  it'll automatically be selected.
[589.66s -> 591.59s]  Just hit space bar to perform the action.
[591.59s -> 592.63s]  Now it's your turn.
[592.63s -> 595.11s]  Press the left mouse button or use the moving keys
[595.11s -> 596.79s]  to walk up to a piece of trash.
[596.79s -> 605.26s]  Is that person stuck in there?
[605.26s -> 608.46s]  Holy shit, that person almost died.
[609.53s -> 611.45s]  That was like almost a vicious camel attack.
[611.45s -> 612.66s]  All right.
[612.66s -> 615.59s]  Pick it.
[615.59s -> 615.83s]  Great.
[615.83s -> 617.19s]  You can also perform zookeeper dirties.
[617.91s -> 620.73s]  You can also do dirty zookeeper things.
[620.73s -> 622.25s]  You can feed and water animals,
[622.25s -> 627.96s]  groom them, heal them, rake poop.
[627.96s -> 628.52s]  Okay.
[628.52s -> 633.38s]  We're going to be here for a while.
[636.22s -> 637.10s]  Same way.
[637.10s -> 638.38s]  Heal them and of course rake.
[638.38s -> 640.30s]  Doing these things yourself could mean
[640.30s -> 642.94s]  that you don't need to pay a staff member to do it.
[642.94s -> 645.26s]  Very helpful for a financially struggling zoo,
[645.26s -> 646.87s]  but I can do it all myself.
[646.87s -> 649.38s]  I'm not going to have any staff.
[649.38s -> 652.25s]  I always get so fucking destroyed in these games
[652.25s -> 654.66s]  because I hire too many people.
[654.66s -> 657.70s]  You got five janitors, four maintenance guys,
[657.70s -> 658.74s]  six zookeepers.
[658.74s -> 659.46s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[660.26s -> 661.14s]  I'm just going to walk around
[661.14s -> 662.90s]  and if something needs to be done, I'm going to do it myself.
[662.90s -> 665.02s]  I can walk around with a portable hose.
[665.02s -> 669.30s]  That's all you need is a hose.
[669.30s -> 672.55s]  Don't understand?
[672.55s -> 673.59s]  Every single thing,
[673.59s -> 675.59s]  every single job you could possibly think of
[675.59s -> 677.59s]  in the world just requires a hose.
[677.59s -> 679.29s]  Just spray it.
[679.29s -> 682.15s]  Ah, there's like dirt all over my deck.
[682.15s -> 683.19s]  Fucking spray it with a hose.
[683.19s -> 685.69s]  It's done.
[685.69s -> 688.97s]  Oh, I, my car.
[688.97s -> 689.61s]  I need to get a car.
[689.61s -> 691.13s]  Why don't you spray it with a fucking hose, dude?
[691.13s -> 691.77s]  Don't worry about it.
[691.77s -> 692.17s]  It's easy.
[692.97s -> 695.40s]  Oh, my taxes aren't done on time.
[695.40s -> 697.00s]  Just spray your taxes with the hose.
[697.00s -> 703.64s]  Time check of photo safari mode.
[703.64s -> 705.00s]  Click on the photo safari view button.
[705.00s -> 705.32s]  Okay.
[705.32s -> 706.60s]  So here's the photo mode.
[706.60s -> 707.80s]  You can take pictures and shit.
[711.66s -> 714.70s]  This is just going to be Hey You Pikachu, right?
[714.70s -> 719.58s]  What's the game that just came out?
[719.58s -> 721.18s]  Let's Go Pikachu, right?
[721.26s -> 728.25s]  In this photo, so you can zoom your camera in,
[728.25s -> 729.13s]  take photographs of everything.
[729.13s -> 730.73s]  You just press spacebar to take a picture.
[730.73s -> 731.99s]  Okay.
[731.99s -> 733.94s]  Let's return.
[733.94s -> 734.98s]  So I want to move this.
[734.98s -> 743.02s]  That's a pretty cool photo.
[743.02s -> 743.66s]  Hold on.
[743.66s -> 749.75s]  This is such a spy cam.
[755.10s -> 755.50s]  I got it.
[758.97s -> 760.25s]  Just hose the trash.
[760.25s -> 760.89s]  It's fine.
[760.89s -> 761.96s]  All right.
[761.96s -> 763.08s]  Click the overhead button.
[763.08s -> 764.34s]  It's this one right here.
[764.34s -> 766.50s]  That's the big circle is the overhead mode.
[766.50s -> 768.87s]  You need the overview map by clicking on the overview.
[768.87s -> 770.47s]  This one, click to switch the overview,
[770.47s -> 772.39s]  which allows you to jump directly to any exhibit
[772.39s -> 773.83s]  or specific zoo area.
[773.83s -> 774.33s]  Okay.
[775.03s -> 778.10s]  The overview map gives you a broad layout of your zoo.
[778.10s -> 780.34s]  You can quickly jump around from place to place in your zoo.
[781.14s -> 782.60s]  Okay.
[782.60s -> 784.68s]  So there's a crocodile exhibit.
[784.68s -> 785.48s]  Oops, a daisy.
[786.28s -> 788.30s]  Press F1 to open the zoopedia.
[788.94s -> 791.05s]  This is fucking a ton of information.
[791.85s -> 794.68s]  That information about game controls, animals in the zoo.
[794.68s -> 797.08s]  Press F1 to open zoopedia and some panels.
[797.08s -> 799.64s]  You can click on some shit and learn some stuff.
[799.64s -> 800.14s]  Okay.
[801.00s -> 801.56s]  F1 is...
[802.94s -> 803.18s]  All right.
[803.18s -> 804.15s]  We did it.
[804.15s -> 804.87s]  I know how to play.
[807.13s -> 808.01s]  Never mind.
[808.01s -> 809.42s]  Click the next...
[809.42s -> 809.66s]  Yeah.
[809.66s -> 810.30s]  Let's just go.
[810.30s -> 811.42s]  Let's bang them all up.
[811.42s -> 811.90s]  What time...
[811.90s -> 812.46s]  What'd that take?
[813.74s -> 814.30s]  Seven minutes?
[823.27s -> 825.35s]  The following, you will learn the basics of construction,
[825.35s -> 827.19s]  how to make a basic exhibit, change terrain.
[827.19s -> 827.99s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[827.99s -> 828.71s]  You don't start, buddy.
[828.71s -> 829.11s]  Let's go.
[829.75s -> 832.41s]  Select the recycle objects and buildings button.
[833.21s -> 834.89s]  So this is this one.
[837.21s -> 837.77s]  All right.
[837.77s -> 838.25s]  Somebody...
[838.89s -> 839.85s]  Somebody correct me here.
[840.41s -> 841.85s]  I need to be corrected if I'm wrong.
[843.14s -> 845.86s]  This is like the Windows 3.1 panel, isn't it?
[845.86s -> 846.66s]  Like the Windows...
[846.66s -> 847.86s]  This is an old Windows panel.
[848.66s -> 849.62s]  That used to exist.
[849.62s -> 850.74s]  This is my computer.
[851.30s -> 853.30s]  This is the undo button.
[855.32s -> 855.80s]  Yes, it is.
[855.80s -> 857.00s]  Like this used to be there.
[857.00s -> 858.52s]  This is the panel for Windows 3.1.
[865.34s -> 866.06s]  He's a boomer.
[867.24s -> 868.28s]  40-year-old streamer.
[869.08s -> 870.28s]  Getting real fucking close.
[870.84s -> 872.36s]  Sooner or later, I have to stop saying the F word.
[872.36s -> 875.43s]  After 40, you can't say the F word anymore.
[875.43s -> 877.90s]  What 40-year-old do you know that says the F word?
[877.90s -> 879.02s]  I don't know very many.
[879.02s -> 880.06s]  They're like,
[880.06s -> 880.38s]  Oh, hi.
[880.38s -> 881.10s]  Yes, how are you?
[881.10s -> 882.30s]  I'm a 40-year-old guy.
[882.30s -> 882.70s]  They're not like,
[882.70s -> 884.22s]  Hey, what's up, you fucking dude?
[884.22s -> 885.10s]  I gotta stop doing that.
[892.18s -> 892.50s]  All right.
[892.50s -> 894.26s]  Remove unwanted objects from your zoo.
[894.26s -> 895.99s]  Click the button.
[895.99s -> 899.67s]  Look for the solitary tree inside a rectangular area enclosed by a path.
[899.91s -> 904.44s]  It's marked with an X painted in the dirt.
[904.44s -> 908.06s]  The baobab tree is right in the center of this area.
[908.06s -> 912.06s]  Move your cursor over the baobab tree and click to recycle it.
[912.06s -> 913.54s]  Okay.
[913.54s -> 915.83s]  We're looking for an X.
[915.83s -> 916.79s]  We're looking for...
[916.79s -> 917.75s]  I don't, please.
[917.75s -> 919.03s]  I'm fucking kidding.
[919.03s -> 919.82s]  Good job.
[919.82s -> 921.42s]  You received cash for recycled objects,
[921.42s -> 924.12s]  but it will only be a portion of its full purchase price.
[924.12s -> 927.35s]  Note that you can't recycle animals.
[927.35s -> 928.55s]  That just wouldn't be right.
[929.29s -> 932.41s]  Click the check button on this panel to continue.
[932.41s -> 932.65s]  Yeah.
[932.65s -> 938.01s]  I mean, it's kind of can't...
[941.19s -> 945.96s]  Is like eating animals, recycling them?
[945.96s -> 947.24s]  Think about that for a second.
[947.24s -> 951.77s]  That is essentially like recycling.
[951.77s -> 958.38s]  You consume, you don't waste, reusing.
[958.38s -> 968.39s]  And then you plant the bones and then a tree grows out of the bone.
[968.39s -> 972.94s]  And that's how, where animals come from.
[972.94s -> 973.74s]  A cow tree.
[977.18s -> 977.50s]  All right.
[977.50s -> 978.46s]  Well, I wish we weren't really...
[978.46s -> 980.98s]  We wouldn't have wanted that tree.
[980.98s -> 981.86s]  We can get it back though.
[981.86s -> 984.33s]  Click on the undo button right now.
[984.33s -> 985.69s]  I wonder how far, how many times you can do that.
[991.34s -> 994.46s]  That dinosaur pee was recycled over the next few thousand years
[994.46s -> 996.50s]  to become your coffee.
[996.50s -> 996.98s]  That's fine.
[999.59s -> 1001.59s]  I don't care.
[1001.59s -> 1006.92s]  You could tell me that coffee was like rat shit mixed in water
[1006.92s -> 1008.22s]  and I'd still drink it.
[1008.22s -> 1008.94s]  I would.
[1008.94s -> 1010.22s]  How would that change anything?
[1010.22s -> 1011.10s]  Right?
[1011.10s -> 1011.58s]  Oh my God.
[1011.58s -> 1013.18s]  No, there's no, I would not eat that.
[1013.18s -> 1013.66s]  I wouldn't drink.
[1013.66s -> 1014.14s]  Yes, you would.
[1014.14s -> 1014.62s]  What changed?
[1014.62s -> 1015.18s]  How does that change?
[1018.97s -> 1022.09s]  Coffee is actually, it's burnt cigarette ashes
[1022.09s -> 1023.85s]  and rat shit mixed in water.
[1023.85s -> 1026.73s]  There's a huge study that just a big whistleblower came out.
[1026.73s -> 1027.85s]  I'd be like, I don't care.
[1027.85s -> 1032.94s]  All right, undo.
[1032.94s -> 1035.98s]  You can use undo to reverse the last thing you did.
[1035.98s -> 1036.78s]  This is very handy.
[1036.78s -> 1038.02s]  Yeah, I know.
[1038.02s -> 1038.42s]  Wait.
[1038.42s -> 1042.39s]  Note that you can only undo the last thing you did.
[1042.39s -> 1046.25s]  So you can't just control Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z.
[1046.25s -> 1050.71s]  You can only do one thing.
[1050.71s -> 1055.21s]  Video games weren't that advanced yet.
[1055.21s -> 1056.65s]  So you can't only go back one time.
[1056.65s -> 1058.33s]  Which, I mean, this is one of the greatest games ever made.
[1058.33s -> 1059.29s]  So who cares?
[1059.29s -> 1060.49s]  All right, let's build a building.
[1060.49s -> 1063.98s]  The construction panel is where you'll want to place fences, paths,
[1063.98s -> 1065.18s]  zoo building scenarios.
[1065.18s -> 1065.58s]  I'm sorry.
[1065.58s -> 1066.78s]  You know what keeps happening?
[1066.94s -> 1070.39s]  Is my fucking cigarette ash rat shit is,
[1070.39s -> 1072.23s]  there's a little bit on the bottom that I didn't wipe up
[1072.23s -> 1073.27s]  and I have it on a coaster.
[1073.27s -> 1077.53s]  And every time I pick up the glass,
[1077.53s -> 1080.01s]  the coaster sticks to the bottom of the coffee
[1080.01s -> 1082.49s]  and then falls off after I pick it up for a second.
[1082.49s -> 1084.01s]  There's nothing I can do about it.
[1084.01s -> 1089.96s]  All right, fences, paths, zoos, you know,
[1089.96s -> 1091.48s]  all kinds of the manmade objects in the zoo.
[1091.48s -> 1092.28s]  Click the check button.
[1092.28s -> 1096.57s]  Let's go.
[1096.57s -> 1098.57s]  Fence is the most common way to keep your animals in
[1098.57s -> 1100.66s]  and your guests out.
[1100.66s -> 1102.97s]  Click on the rectangle fence.
[1102.97s -> 1105.13s]  So this is the rectangle fence placement.
[1105.13s -> 1106.17s]  This is free form.
[1107.13s -> 1108.41s]  I gotta like pay attention.
[1108.41s -> 1109.37s]  I am, I am.
[1110.94s -> 1113.38s]  Easily create an enclosed habitat.
[1113.38s -> 1116.82s]  So find the rectangle area enclosed by a path.
[1116.82s -> 1119.62s]  It's the same area where you just replaced the bob tree.
[1119.62s -> 1121.30s]  Let's create a fenced area.
[1121.30s -> 1124.02s]  Select the chain link fence
[1124.02s -> 1129.32s]  and they click on the ground to anchor the corner.
[1129.32s -> 1133.00s]  So I want to do it like here.
[1133.00s -> 1133.88s]  All right, but here's that.
[1133.88s -> 1135.72s]  Do I want it on the Mario Kart track
[1135.72s -> 1137.72s]  or do I want it off the Mario Kart track?
[1140.46s -> 1144.57s]  Off the Mario Kart track, right?
[1144.57s -> 1145.93s]  On the Mario Kart track.
[1145.93s -> 1149.06s]  No, but how is Luigi gonna get in first place?
[1149.06s -> 1157.82s]  Anchor the corner.
[1157.82s -> 1158.38s]  It's just right here.
[1158.38s -> 1159.02s]  It's fine, whatever.
[1160.34s -> 1161.70s]  Will your mouse see a preview of the enclosure
[1161.70s -> 1162.74s]  and click again to place the fence?
[1162.74s -> 1169.46s]  Make a fenced area as large as the rectangle.
[1169.46s -> 1170.18s]  Great.
[1170.18s -> 1170.90s]  Basic enclosure.
[1170.90s -> 1173.38s]  Later, you can try the octagonal placement mode
[1173.38s -> 1176.10s]  to make an octagonal shape with the rubber band mode
[1176.10s -> 1177.30s]  to place single sections.
[1177.30s -> 1178.98s]  Click the check button to continue.
[1178.98s -> 1181.38s]  Now it's time to place a gate.
[1181.38s -> 1184.10s]  This is where this is just the key line staff gate.
[1184.10s -> 1188.47s]  I guess it could really just go like right here.
[1188.47s -> 1191.69s]  Place it over the fenced area you just made.
[1191.69s -> 1193.13s]  The gate preview will snap into place.
[1195.13s -> 1196.01s]  How about right there?
[1196.01s -> 1198.36s]  You want to make sure that your enclosed areas
[1198.36s -> 1199.48s]  have gates that your staff can get in
[1199.48s -> 1200.68s]  and take care of the animals.
[1200.68s -> 1202.36s]  Right now we're only using the chain link fence.
[1202.36s -> 1204.12s]  But there are all kinds of different fences.
[1204.12s -> 1205.96s]  The staff gate will automatically work on any of them.
[1205.96s -> 1207.35s]  Just get out.
[1207.35s -> 1208.25s]  Get out.
[1208.25s -> 1208.89s]  Whatever.
[1208.89s -> 1211.08s]  All right, here's the scenery tab.
[1211.08s -> 1212.12s]  So this is the fence tab.
[1212.12s -> 1213.40s]  That's where you keep animals in.
[1213.40s -> 1215.24s]  Here's the scenery tab.
[1222.30s -> 1224.14s]  Somebody just said chain link.
[1224.14s -> 1227.19s]  No, we don't talk about cryptocurrency anymore
[1227.19s -> 1227.67s]  on this channel.
[1229.90s -> 1232.22s]  We don't discuss crypto assets anymore, okay?
[1232.22s -> 1242.76s]  It's all right.
[1242.76s -> 1246.97s]  Everything's fine.
[1247.05s -> 1248.97s]  That's how you know he lost big.
[1248.97s -> 1250.17s]  I didn't lose anything.
[1250.17s -> 1254.07s]  Up here, upstairs, inside of the skull,
[1254.07s -> 1255.27s]  there's a device up there.
[1255.27s -> 1261.88s]  There's a thing up there that has so much, so much in it.
[1261.88s -> 1265.11s]  And I, let me tell you, I got fucking coaster.
[1265.11s -> 1267.35s]  I'm, I got out, all right?
[1267.35s -> 1269.27s]  I left some in, I got out.
[1269.27s -> 1271.16s]  I was interested, not invested.
[1271.16s -> 1272.98s]  Let's make that very clear.
[1276.14s -> 1277.98s]  I have to put this, I'm changing coaster.
[1277.98s -> 1286.94s]  All right, I have a different coaster now.
[1286.94s -> 1288.30s]  Mom says it's my turn.
[1288.30s -> 1289.26s]  No, it's not.
[1289.26s -> 1291.54s]  All right, nobody'd see many objects
[1291.54s -> 1292.66s]  on the scenery by panel.
[1292.66s -> 1294.02s]  But for now, we've narrowed it down
[1294.02s -> 1295.78s]  to just one, the donation box.
[1295.78s -> 1298.74s]  Click the, all right, the donation box.
[1298.74s -> 1301.80s]  Okay, okay, I can get by on this one.
[1301.80s -> 1304.22s]  You have a donation box selected.
[1304.22s -> 1308.30s]  Move your mouse over the world to see a preview.
[1308.30s -> 1312.79s]  Okay, you can rotate it with the keys of those.
[1312.79s -> 1314.86s]  Okay, that's weird.
[1314.86s -> 1317.72s]  Oh shit, you should place donation boxes
[1317.72s -> 1319.94s]  near every single stream.
[1319.94s -> 1322.74s]  If viewers can't find a donation box,
[1322.74s -> 1324.90s]  make sure to put an overlay on your stream,
[1324.90s -> 1326.98s]  telling them exactly where to go,
[1326.98s -> 1329.66s]  and maybe even in your title as well.
[1329.66s -> 1331.50s]  So then they are absolutely certain
[1331.50s -> 1333.80s]  of the correct way to give you
[1334.44s -> 1336.58s]  any amount of money during the whole stream,
[1336.58s -> 1346.12s]  is what I, I'm sorry, that's all I saw.
[1346.12s -> 1348.54s]  All right, it's often a good idea
[1348.54s -> 1349.74s]  to place multiple donation boxes
[1349.74s -> 1352.86s]  so that guests won't be inconvenienced in any way.
[1352.86s -> 1356.31s]  So if guests can't find a donation,
[1357.03s -> 1358.55s]  the cash will stay in their pockets.
[1358.55s -> 1360.58s]  So this is how you make money.
[1360.58s -> 1365.00s]  Okay, pathing tab.
[1365.00s -> 1366.44s]  You'll see that there are a number
[1366.44s -> 1368.46s]  of different paths that you can choose from.
[1368.46s -> 1370.38s]  Guests don't so much care
[1370.38s -> 1372.94s]  what type of path surfaces in your zoo,
[1372.94s -> 1374.70s]  but they do care that there is one.
[1374.70s -> 1376.94s]  Click check button on this panel.
[1376.94s -> 1379.14s]  Paths work like fences do.
[1379.14s -> 1381.46s]  Click on the ground to anchor the path,
[1381.46s -> 1382.26s]  then move the mouse.
[1382.26s -> 1390.54s]  Yeah, yeah, so this is a standard asphalt path.
[1390.54s -> 1391.90s]  Now I'm not going to do it.
[1391.90s -> 1396.50s]  I don't know why I thought that would be funny.
[1396.50s -> 1397.86s]  Yeah, I'm just going to say it,
[1397.86s -> 1399.22s]  like, and then delete it, okay?
[1399.22s -> 1402.50s]  You know, I had diarrhea last night.
[1402.50s -> 1404.02s]  Yeah, well, it was my leg's fault.
[1404.02s -> 1404.90s]  It was my ass fault.
[1406.60s -> 1416.20s]  And now you can delete it
[1416.20s -> 1417.72s]  because there's no context,
[1417.72s -> 1418.44s]  it makes no sense.
[1421.24s -> 1424.52s]  Then move the mouse to see a preview of the path.
[1424.52s -> 1426.52s]  What does that have to do with like concrete though?
[1426.52s -> 1429.13s]  Somebody make that joke funny,
[1429.13s -> 1431.05s]  like change it to like I had diarrhea
[1431.05s -> 1432.25s]  on the ground or something.
[1432.25s -> 1435.96s]  Like I, or like I fell down on the ground
[1435.96s -> 1437.24s]  and I landed on my bum.
[1437.24s -> 1439.24s]  And so it wasn't, somebody will figure it out.
[1439.24s -> 1440.68s]  And then I want a 10% commission.
[1444.95s -> 1446.31s]  I don't know what's wrong with me tonight.
[1446.31s -> 1451.93s]  Then move the mouse to see a preview.
[1451.93s -> 1454.60s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, click and place it.
[1454.60s -> 1456.60s]  Notice that the path on the map is very narrow
[1456.60s -> 1457.88s]  around the rectangular exhibit area.
[1457.88s -> 1460.84s]  Place some new path to make it wider for your guests.
[1460.84s -> 1463.74s]  Wait, it wants me to like do this, okay.
[1463.74s -> 1465.58s]  You want to make sure that your path
[1466.14s -> 1467.26s]  lead to your exhibits.
[1467.26s -> 1470.18s]  Guests stand on paths to view exhibits.
[1470.18s -> 1470.90s]  They stand around.
[1470.90s -> 1473.06s]  So if your paths are far too away,
[1473.06s -> 1474.58s]  your guests won't see your exhibits.
[1474.58s -> 1476.66s]  You'll miss out on your great animals
[1476.66s -> 1478.44s]  and you'll miss out on their donations.
[1478.44s -> 1479.80s]  Yep, you'll want those paths
[1479.80s -> 1481.56s]  leading to your donation boxes too.
[1481.56s -> 1484.33s]  Click the check button on this panel to continue.
[1484.33s -> 1486.84s]  Why do I keep reading that of all the things?
[1486.84s -> 1487.80s]  All right, here's the building.
[1487.80s -> 1490.28s]  So this is the fence tab, path tab, building tab.
[1492.14s -> 1495.37s]  There's all kinds of buildings.
[1495.37s -> 1498.81s]  Jerma, calm down.
[1498.81s -> 1499.53s]  I'm all right.
[1499.53s -> 1504.15s]  Okay, from food and drinks stands to restrooms and more.
[1504.79s -> 1507.66s]  I purchased a hot dog food stand,
[1507.66s -> 1510.82s]  a pretzel cart and a soda drink stand.
[1510.82s -> 1513.11s]  You already have the hot dog stand.
[1513.11s -> 1515.27s]  Move your mouse over the zoo to see a preview.
[1515.27s -> 1516.31s]  Yeah, yeah.
[1516.31s -> 1518.86s]  Notice the green access arrow which shows
[1519.58s -> 1521.50s]  side that guests will approach.
[1521.50s -> 1523.78s]  Okay, so this is the side that they approach.
[1523.78s -> 1525.38s]  Go ahead and place one of each building now.
[1525.38s -> 1528.54s]  So we want to have that be completely accessible.
[1528.54s -> 1529.78s]  So one right here.
[1531.16s -> 1533.64s]  Let's get one right here.
[1534.28s -> 1535.32s]  This is just the tutorial.
[1536.28s -> 1537.64s]  That'll be a fucking brilliant design.
[1537.64s -> 1541.43s]  Don't worry.
[1541.43s -> 1543.83s]  Guests get hungry, thirsty and need to use the bathroom
[1543.83s -> 1544.87s]  while visiting your zoo.
[1547.11s -> 1548.47s]  If you don't, the asphalt.
[1548.47s -> 1551.03s]  If you don't provide them with amenities to meet these needs,
[1551.03s -> 1553.83s]  they may leave prematurely and take their cash with them.
[1553.83s -> 1556.68s]  Like exhibits and donation boxes.
[1556.68s -> 1558.60s]  Hold on, someone's gonna steal the donation box?
[1561.46s -> 1562.50s]  Make sure the guests are happy.
[1562.50s -> 1566.26s]  Otherwise they'll sprint out of the park with,
[1566.26s -> 1577.34s]  it's stuck on the bottom of that one too.
[1577.34s -> 1578.38s]  I don't know why that's happening.
[1580.65s -> 1582.57s]  They may sprint out of your store
[1582.57s -> 1584.73s]  with the donation box laughing the whole time.
[1584.73s -> 1586.33s]  Make sure that you have pass
[1586.33s -> 1587.93s]  leading to all your great amenities.
[1587.93s -> 1594.65s]  Click on the pretzel cart you just placed in your zoo.
[1600.02s -> 1601.46s]  Pretzel cart guy for the next one on bullets.
[1601.46s -> 1602.42s]  Where'd I go?
[1602.42s -> 1603.62s]  Great, you have the pretzel cart selected.
[1603.62s -> 1605.14s]  Note that an information panel opens up
[1605.14s -> 1607.80s]  showing the item you have selected.
[1607.80s -> 1609.64s]  Don't worry about all the things on this panel for now.
[1609.64s -> 1615.54s]  We'll come back to this later.
[1615.54s -> 1616.98s]  So you can pick up a building.
[1616.98s -> 1619.85s]  This is to move it if you want to change where it is.
[1621.93s -> 1624.22s]  Click the object.
[1624.22s -> 1624.94s]  Yeah, that's fine.
[1624.94s -> 1626.78s]  So we just go like this if we want to move it.
[1629.34s -> 1631.14s]  Yep, yep, yep.
[1631.14s -> 1633.54s]  Clicking and holding the left mouse button.
[1633.54s -> 1635.83s]  Okay, that makes it easier.
[1635.83s -> 1643.22s]  Let me test that out.
[1643.22s -> 1644.90s]  Okay, yeah, so that's how you do it.
[1644.90s -> 1646.76s]  You can just move the mouse around.
[1646.76s -> 1647.72s]  All right, adopting animals.
[1647.72s -> 1648.52s]  Click on the animals button
[1648.52s -> 1650.04s]  to open the animal adoption tab.
[1650.04s -> 1652.52s]  This is where you'll obtain animals for your zoo.
[1652.52s -> 1653.80s]  Great, now let's adopt an animal.
[1653.80s -> 1655.48s]  Click on the button to continue.
[1655.48s -> 1660.07s]  Okay, so you can do male or female.
[1662.78s -> 1665.18s]  You'll see that you already have the African elephant
[1665.18s -> 1666.62s]  selected on the adoption panel.
[1666.62s -> 1668.62s]  Move your mouse cursor over to the fenced area
[1668.62s -> 1671.75s]  that you made earlier and place the African elephant
[1671.75s -> 1676.49s]  inside of the other enclosure and cause a huge problem
[1676.49s -> 1684.44s]  because an elephant and a camel are gonna fight.
[1684.44s -> 1685.72s]  Excellent, now you have a new animal.
[1685.72s -> 1686.60s]  Guests come to see animals.
[1686.60s -> 1691.08s]  So if you have no animals, you'll have no guests.
[1691.08s -> 1692.36s]  Let them fight.
[1692.36s -> 1693.48s]  No, we didn't look.
[1693.48s -> 1695.80s]  Those of you that might be new to the stream,
[1695.80s -> 1697.40s]  or those of you that are old to the stream,
[1697.40s -> 1699.74s]  you gotta give me like at least an hour or two
[1699.74s -> 1702.89s]  to play the game because once it goes off the rails
[1702.89s -> 1706.26s]  and I start putting like birds inside
[1706.26s -> 1707.30s]  of the elephant enclosure
[1707.30s -> 1709.06s]  and the elephants start picking birds out of the air
[1709.06s -> 1710.10s]  and eating them with their trunks.
[1710.82s -> 1712.74s]  I'm never gonna go back and play the game ever again
[1712.74s -> 1713.94s]  the way it's meant to be played.
[1713.94s -> 1718.98s]  So it's already off the rails.
[1718.98s -> 1720.82s]  I'm just in the tutorial.
[1720.82s -> 1723.69s]  What do you mean it's off the rails?
[1723.69s -> 1725.13s]  I'm in the tutorial.
[1725.13s -> 1728.87s]  I made an asphalt joke and it was very bad
[1728.87s -> 1730.23s]  and I was corrected.
[1732.18s -> 1733.78s]  I'm willing to admit when I'm incorrect
[1733.78s -> 1736.07s]  and wrong about something.
[1736.07s -> 1737.43s]  I was not correct.
[1737.43s -> 1745.72s]  Check ass.
[1745.72s -> 1746.92s]  All animals require food and water
[1746.92s -> 1748.76s]  but they won't eat just anything, will you?
[1748.76s -> 1749.48s]  That's true.
[1749.48s -> 1754.63s]  Okay, how to determine what an animal eats later.
[1754.63s -> 1755.03s]  All right.
[1755.03s -> 1758.20s]  So we got hay or we got water.
[1758.20s -> 1760.30s]  I'm assuming we need both.
[1760.30s -> 1761.66s]  Purchase food and water.
[1761.66s -> 1765.13s]  Place a food trough with hay and food
[1765.13s -> 1767.88s]  through with water near the elephant
[1767.88s -> 1768.92s]  by clicking on the dish
[1768.92s -> 1770.60s]  and then clicking inside of the enclosure.
[1770.60s -> 1773.18s]  So it can just kind of be anywhere, right?
[1773.18s -> 1776.23s]  We'll do two of these and then two of these.
[1776.23s -> 1777.59s]  Oh, one of those actually.
[1777.59s -> 1778.07s]  That's fine.
[1779.85s -> 1780.89s]  Select the animal shelters tab
[1780.89s -> 1782.89s]  to open up the animal shelter panel.
[1782.89s -> 1785.74s]  So here is while an exhausted animal might...
[1785.74s -> 1786.54s]  What is he doing?
[1786.54s -> 1787.58s]  He's spraying it with like poison.
[1787.58s -> 1787.82s]  What are you?
[1787.82s -> 1789.26s]  Oh, no, it's a hose.
[1789.34s -> 1790.78s]  See, portable hose.
[1790.78s -> 1798.49s]  Portable hose.
[1798.49s -> 1800.89s]  While an exhausted animal might just sleep anywhere.
[1800.89s -> 1803.29s]  Most animals require a shelter.
[1803.29s -> 1804.97s]  So this is the elephant shelter.
[1804.97s -> 1807.96s]  Certain advanced objects need to be studied
[1807.96s -> 1810.18s]  more carefully before you have access to them.
[1810.18s -> 1812.58s]  You do this by choosing to research the object.
[1812.58s -> 1813.78s]  Objects that need to be researched
[1813.78s -> 1816.68s]  have a small beaker appearing over their icon.
[1816.68s -> 1818.66s]  Press the research button on the object.
[1818.66s -> 1819.86s]  Info panel will begin research on it.
[1819.86s -> 1820.66s]  I don't have it yet.
[1820.66s -> 1822.86s]  So let's go ahead and research it.
[1822.86s -> 1826.18s]  It costs a thousand bucks to research time and money.
[1826.18s -> 1827.46s]  Once the research has been completed,
[1827.46s -> 1828.74s]  the object is available for purchase.
[1828.74s -> 1830.26s]  Click the check button.
[1830.26s -> 1831.14s]  Stop reading that.
[1831.14s -> 1833.53s]  Why is that even there?
[1833.53s -> 1835.45s]  Wait for it to be done.
[1835.45s -> 1837.69s]  Wait for your units to be ready and your RTS.
[1837.69s -> 1839.05s]  Okay, now you can place it.
[1839.05s -> 1842.68s]  All right, you can do other things
[1842.68s -> 1843.88s]  while the objects are being researched.
[1843.88s -> 1846.97s]  This would be a great time to take a look around the zoo.
[1846.97s -> 1851.13s]  Okay, it's done.
[1851.13s -> 1852.01s]  So I need to be...
[1852.01s -> 1853.13s]  Let's put it like...
[1853.13s -> 1859.37s]  Put it like in the corner right here.
[1859.37s -> 1865.08s]  All right, animal enrichment tab.
[1865.08s -> 1866.33s]  Hold on, wait.
[1866.33s -> 1868.47s]  What is this?
[1868.47s -> 1870.39s]  An enrichment objects enhance an exhibit area
[1870.39s -> 1872.34s]  for many species of animals
[1872.34s -> 1873.78s]  by keeping them active and entertained
[1873.78s -> 1875.69s]  in their environment.
[1875.69s -> 1878.07s]  So this is a pursuit ball.
[1878.07s -> 1879.83s]  There are many enrichment objects available
[1879.83s -> 1880.71s]  in Zoo Tycoon 2,
[1880.71s -> 1884.09s]  but for now we've narrowed the selection down to one.
[1884.09s -> 1886.71s]  An exercise ball.
[1886.71s -> 1888.15s]  All right, so let's watch them play with it.
[1888.15s -> 1889.27s]  Can I play with them in here?
[1889.27s -> 1893.10s]  They have different levels of interest.
[1893.10s -> 1894.44s]  We'll go into more detail later
[1894.44s -> 1896.20s]  about how to find out about what they do.
[1896.20s -> 1899.24s]  Okay, open the landscaping tab.
[1899.24s -> 1899.96s]  Jesus.
[1899.96s -> 1903.54s]  All the tools you need to create a proper habitat,
[1903.54s -> 1905.62s]  also known as a biome.
[1905.62s -> 1906.34s]  Click the check.
[1908.20s -> 1912.23s]  Okay, I need a savanna biome.
[1912.23s -> 1915.00s]  Savanna, okay.
[1915.00s -> 1920.79s]  So it needs to be a savanna in here.
[1920.79s -> 1921.51s]  After you find it,
[1921.51s -> 1924.71s]  move the cursor into the African Elephant's enclosure
[1924.71s -> 1926.79s]  and click and drag to start painting with the land
[1926.79s -> 1928.71s]  appropriate to the savanna biome.
[1928.71s -> 1933.59s]  Okay, so like this.
[1933.59s -> 1934.31s]  Does it matter?
[1934.31s -> 1939.11s]  It really is painting.
[1939.11s -> 1945.37s]  Are we sure?
[1945.37s -> 1948.33s]  This looks like hamster spray spread stuff.
[1948.33s -> 1952.68s]  Are we trying to trick the animal into thinking
[1952.68s -> 1954.04s]  this is just the bag of shit
[1954.04s -> 1955.16s]  that you get for your hamster?
[1955.16s -> 1960.89s]  That's not the savanna.
[1960.89s -> 1966.07s]  It's a pretty big hamster.
[1966.07s -> 1967.67s]  Imagine you had one hamster in here.
[1968.31s -> 1971.38s]  This is some richy rich asshole.
[1971.38s -> 1973.69s]  Didn't that happen in that movie?
[1973.69s -> 1975.85s]  He had like a little chipmunk friend
[1975.85s -> 1977.61s]  and he had a giant enclosure for it.
[1977.61s -> 1980.10s]  And the thing, it was like CG.
[1980.10s -> 1980.98s]  In the beginning of the movie,
[1980.98s -> 1984.42s]  they did this elaborate like four or five minute intro sequence
[1984.42s -> 1985.70s]  where he was doing like jumping
[1985.70s -> 1988.34s]  and flipping around on bars
[1988.34s -> 1989.78s]  and going to the ball pits and stuff.
[1989.78s -> 1991.38s]  It was like a fully animated sequence.
[1999.62s -> 2000.42s]  Great.
[2000.42s -> 2001.78s]  If real life beckons,
[2001.78s -> 2003.86s]  you can pause the game and never miss the action.
[2003.86s -> 2005.46s]  Keep in mind though that you can also build
[2005.46s -> 2006.74s]  while the game is paused.
[2008.22s -> 2008.78s]  Oh, that's good.
[2008.78s -> 2009.58s]  Like the Sims.
[2009.58s -> 2011.64s]  It can be helpful if guests or animals
[2011.64s -> 2013.08s]  move into an area where you want to build.
[2013.08s -> 2015.96s]  Just pause the game and move them out of the way
[2015.96s -> 2019.51s]  with the check button panel to continue.
[2019.51s -> 2020.87s]  Hire staff.
[2020.87s -> 2021.59s]  Okay.
[2021.59s -> 2024.20s]  There are a lot of different workers.
[2024.20s -> 2024.44s]  Okay.
[2024.44s -> 2025.40s]  We're just like the Sims.
[2025.40s -> 2031.13s]  We've got mascots, construction workers, crime, and musician.
[2031.13s -> 2034.60s]  That's the only four things anyone ever does in The Sims.
[2034.60s -> 2035.16s]  So that's good.
[2037.27s -> 2039.03s]  Maintenance, animal care, and guest education.
[2041.51s -> 2042.87s]  I kind of want the dinosaur guy.
[2046.62s -> 2047.90s]  Should I not have put him in there?
[2047.90s -> 2049.98s]  Should I not have put like dinosaur Gumby
[2049.98s -> 2051.34s]  inside of the elephant enclosure?
[2052.06s -> 2055.62s]  The zookeeper staff member specializes in animal care
[2055.62s -> 2057.38s]  and will make sure that your animals receive food
[2057.38s -> 2058.26s]  and water as needed.
[2058.90s -> 2062.09s]  It will also treat illnesses and groom dirty animals.
[2063.24s -> 2063.56s]  Okay.
[2063.56s -> 2067.35s]  So I want to put this is zookeeper staff.
[2067.35s -> 2068.47s]  Specialized in animal care.
[2072.10s -> 2074.10s]  Educator will enhance the educational experience
[2074.10s -> 2074.74s]  for your guests.
[2077.74s -> 2078.54s]  Place them somewhere.
[2080.63s -> 2080.87s]  Great.
[2080.87s -> 2081.51s]  You have an educator.
[2081.51s -> 2083.75s]  Educators need an educator podium to speak from.
[2083.75s -> 2085.27s]  Otherwise, the guests won't be able to hear them.
[2085.91s -> 2087.59s]  Now we need to make a podium.
[2087.59s -> 2089.27s]  So we need an educator podium.
[2092.73s -> 2094.01s]  I almost just put, okay.
[2094.01s -> 2095.77s]  I put down, let's put it on a soft drink stand.
[2096.76s -> 2098.36s]  Purchase an educator podium, click on the podium,
[2098.36s -> 2100.36s]  and give mouse over to see, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2100.36s -> 2102.60s]  So don't forget the green screen.
[2103.56s -> 2105.88s]  Shows the position where the educator will stand
[2105.88s -> 2107.08s]  to speak to the guests.
[2107.08s -> 2109.96s]  So that has to be kind of right here.
[2112.12s -> 2114.57s]  They can go to work educating your guests
[2114.57s -> 2115.45s]  by educating your guests.
[2115.45s -> 2117.69s]  You can increase the amount of money you receive
[2117.69s -> 2119.21s]  from educational donations.
[2120.66s -> 2121.14s]  Great job.
[2121.14s -> 2122.58s]  This is the end of the construction tutorial.
[2122.58s -> 2123.70s]  The next tutorial will teach you a few things
[2123.70s -> 2125.62s]  about accessing information about your zoo.
[2125.62s -> 2126.58s]  Almost done.
[2126.58s -> 2127.78s]  To continue playing the next tutorial,
[2127.78s -> 2128.66s]  click the check mark.
[2128.66s -> 2129.06s]  Hold on.
[2129.06s -> 2129.70s]  We're almost done.
[2130.50s -> 2132.63s]  This is three of three.
[2132.63s -> 2135.99s]  And then I'm going to install mods
[2135.99s -> 2138.07s]  to make a 700 foot tall dinosaur.
[2138.07s -> 2138.57s]  Okay.
[2139.11s -> 2141.30s]  I'm not going to actually do that though.
[2142.10s -> 2145.34s]  Let's see.
[2145.34s -> 2146.46s]  We'll level it up in the world here.
[2147.26s -> 2147.98s]  Getting information.
[2148.78s -> 2149.66s]  In the following tutorial,
[2149.66s -> 2151.50s]  you learn the information about animal staff,
[2151.50s -> 2152.70s]  guest buildings, and your zoo stats.
[2153.26s -> 2153.98s]  Let's get started.
[2153.98s -> 2154.54s]  Click the check.
[2156.55s -> 2157.35s]  Okay.
[2157.86s -> 2158.34s]  All right.
[2158.34s -> 2159.86s]  I got a question for you.
[2159.86s -> 2161.30s]  Would you guys rather me continue like
[2161.30s -> 2162.26s]  to read these and talk
[2162.90s -> 2164.58s]  or silent for the next 10 minutes
[2164.58s -> 2165.30s]  and burn through this?
[2174.57s -> 2177.21s]  Because I'll just like zone in
[2177.21s -> 2179.45s]  and just like download this all into my brain.
[2180.09s -> 2181.40s]  All right.
[2181.40s -> 2182.12s]  I'll be quiet.
[2182.12s -> 2182.60s]  Here we go.
[2217.22s -> 2221.61s]  Okay.
[2221.61s -> 2223.21s]  See, I'm going much faster than I was before.
[2224.50s -> 2224.74s]  Great.
[2224.74s -> 2226.10s]  When you open the first animal band for me,
[2226.10s -> 2227.14s]  I'm on Moitakon's
[2227.14s -> 2228.34s]  in a state of the animal's needs.
[2231.46s -> 2232.18s]  They have needs.
[2234.02s -> 2234.58s]  What? He must...
[2235.46s -> 2236.66s]  His needs are a camel?
[2239.14s -> 2240.34s]  Click on the picture of the animal
[2241.16s -> 2241.80s]  information panel.
[2241.80s -> 2242.76s]  This enables tracking
[2242.76s -> 2244.36s]  and your camera will begin following this.
[2244.36s -> 2245.88s]  So he wants to eat the camel.
[2245.88s -> 2251.67s]  Okay.
[2251.67s -> 2252.71s]  Is this the tracking panel?
[2252.71s -> 2253.91s]  Now zoom in on the selected animal.
[2253.91s -> 2254.63s]  Get a better view.
[2255.27s -> 2258.04s]  Do I not already have a good view?
[2260.92s -> 2261.40s]  How is this?
[2265.62s -> 2267.38s]  I mean, I got a pretty great view right now.
[2270.81s -> 2272.17s]  I know you're hungry, but I...
[2279.13s -> 2279.53s]  No, no.
[2279.53s -> 2280.97s]  Don't put him in a crate.
[2280.97s -> 2282.25s]  Get him out of the crate.
[2282.25s -> 2287.69s]  Get him out of the crate.
[2287.69s -> 2287.93s]  What?
[2289.86s -> 2292.10s]  A closer view will help you see the animal's
[2292.10s -> 2293.06s]  emoticons.
[2293.94s -> 2294.66s]  Emote of what?
[2295.22s -> 2296.18s]  Is that a disease?
[2297.27s -> 2301.75s]  Well, you know, fast forward 15, 20 years
[2301.75s -> 2302.71s]  after this game came out.
[2304.94s -> 2305.98s]  Some people would argue.
[2305.98s -> 2306.46s]  Yeah, it is.
[2308.58s -> 2310.34s]  About how animals tell you about their needs
[2310.34s -> 2312.74s]  and will tell you more about needs in a second.
[2312.74s -> 2314.65s]  When you're all through watching your animal,
[2314.65s -> 2315.77s]  click the check button.
[2315.77s -> 2317.69s]  Great.
[2317.69s -> 2318.57s]  Time to move on to learning
[2318.57s -> 2319.45s]  about the animal's needs.
[2321.30s -> 2322.18s]  Satisfied need.
[2322.18s -> 2323.62s]  The icons on the animal information panel
[2323.62s -> 2325.38s]  represent the animal's needs.
[2325.38s -> 2326.74s]  So here, just like the sims,
[2326.74s -> 2327.86s]  this is just animal sims.
[2327.86s -> 2328.34s]  I got it.
[2328.34s -> 2332.30s]  It means that the need is satisfied
[2332.30s -> 2333.26s]  and is all good.
[2333.26s -> 2334.14s]  Click the check button.
[2337.18s -> 2337.98s]  So when it's yellow,
[2337.98s -> 2338.86s]  it means they really have to,
[2338.86s -> 2340.06s]  they have to really have to go to the bathroom.
[2340.06s -> 2341.74s]  You need to make an animal bathroom for them.
[2341.74s -> 2345.27s]  Animal's thirst.
[2345.27s -> 2345.75s]  Oh, no.
[2345.75s -> 2347.75s]  The icon shown in this story
[2347.75s -> 2348.71s]  represents the animal's thirst.
[2348.71s -> 2350.15s]  When it's shown with a yellow overlay,
[2350.15s -> 2352.89s]  it means that the animal needs pressing.
[2352.89s -> 2354.89s]  This means that the animal will lie on his side
[2354.89s -> 2356.65s]  and you will squeeze on his stomach
[2356.65s -> 2358.09s]  until the juice is pressed out of his...
[2359.54s -> 2361.62s]  Soon trying to satisfy this need.
[2361.62s -> 2363.22s]  Click the check button.
[2363.22s -> 2372.73s]  The icon shown here represents the animal's hungry.
[2372.73s -> 2373.21s]  Yep.
[2373.21s -> 2374.33s]  Thirsty, hungry.
[2374.33s -> 2377.50s]  I don't know what that means.
[2377.58s -> 2379.42s]  Tired and needs exercise.
[2379.42s -> 2382.22s]  I already know.
[2382.22s -> 2383.26s]  It means that the need is critical
[2383.26s -> 2385.18s]  and the animal has not been able to satisfy it.
[2385.18s -> 2386.70s]  It's a good time to check your exhibit area.
[2386.70s -> 2387.82s]  Make sure the right objects,
[2387.82s -> 2389.34s]  in this case the right kind of foods,
[2389.34s -> 2389.98s]  are available.
[2389.98s -> 2396.62s]  This shows their heart rate.
[2396.62s -> 2397.42s]  Here's the status.
[2397.42s -> 2398.06s]  Current activity.
[2398.06s -> 2399.42s]  Resting under the shade.
[2399.42s -> 2400.14s]  Exiting the shade.
[2400.94s -> 2403.32s]  Just like a rollercoaster tycoon.
[2405.99s -> 2407.03s]  Condition that you want to be aware of.
[2407.03s -> 2408.63s]  This is where you see whether an animal is ill
[2408.63s -> 2410.89s]  or expecting a new addition.
[2410.89s -> 2416.63s]  Oh, you can see if they're pregnant.
[2416.63s -> 2417.19s]  Well, I don't...
[2418.71s -> 2419.43s]  They lay eggs.
[2419.43s -> 2422.39s]  So you wouldn't be pregnant.
[2422.71s -> 2423.59s]  All animals lay eggs.
[2423.59s -> 2425.43s]  So at least I think they do.
[2425.43s -> 2428.46s]  The last tab on this panel
[2428.46s -> 2430.22s]  will take you to the animal's general information.
[2430.22s -> 2434.90s]  It's really fine information
[2434.90s -> 2436.34s]  about the animal's gender, preferred biome,
[2436.34s -> 2437.94s]  and which part of the world it originates in.
[2437.94s -> 2442.92s]  Quick check button on this panel.
[2442.92s -> 2445.08s]  Oh, I think my zookeeper is about to lay an egg.
[2445.08s -> 2448.09s]  Get a lot of helpful information
[2448.09s -> 2449.21s]  about an animal's preferences
[2449.21s -> 2450.97s]  using the zookeeper recommendations panel.
[2450.97s -> 2453.77s]  Okay.
[2453.77s -> 2455.69s]  So the zookeeper will tell you what they need,
[2455.69s -> 2456.65s]  what they want.
[2456.65s -> 2459.78s]  It's pretty easy.
[2459.78s -> 2461.22s]  Filter to include only those that are useful
[2461.22s -> 2462.58s]  to the animal you have selected.
[2462.58s -> 2464.68s]  You can choose objects from this panel
[2464.68s -> 2465.56s]  and place them in your zoo
[2465.56s -> 2466.52s]  just as you do with the other.
[2466.52s -> 2468.60s]  The biopanel is covered in the second tutorial.
[2468.60s -> 2473.40s]  Check the box on this panel to close it.
[2473.40s -> 2475.24s]  Mini tabs on the zookeeper
[2475.24s -> 2478.42s]  to see which foods, shelters, plants,
[2478.42s -> 2481.22s]  trees, and enrichment objects the animal prefers.
[2481.22s -> 2483.18s]  So here we go.
[2483.18s -> 2484.06s]  Foods they prefer.
[2484.78s -> 2487.02s]  $75 for a bunch of leaves.
[2487.02s -> 2491.75s]  What the fuck?
[2491.75s -> 2492.23s]  What?
[2492.23s -> 2492.95s]  Oh, I got.
[2492.95s -> 2493.27s]  All right.
[2493.27s -> 2495.54s]  I'm good.
[2495.54s -> 2498.95s]  You can use the mini tabs and close.
[2499.51s -> 2501.27s]  Recommend close the panel after.
[2501.27s -> 2502.31s]  This is all the stuff.
[2502.31s -> 2502.71s]  Rocks.
[2502.71s -> 2504.55s]  They like rocks.
[2504.55s -> 2508.44s]  See?
[2508.44s -> 2510.54s]  They're fans of those.
[2510.54s -> 2511.35s]  All right.
[2511.35s -> 2512.31s]  Close that up.
[2513.98s -> 2515.18s]  Locate a zookeeper in your zoo.
[2515.18s -> 2516.14s]  If they're not in the middle
[2516.14s -> 2517.50s]  of performing a specific task,
[2517.50s -> 2520.06s]  you might find them sitting on one of your benches.
[2520.06s -> 2523.27s]  They're a lot like real people after all.
[2523.27s -> 2524.47s]  Otherwise, they'll be walking around
[2524.47s -> 2525.43s]  tending to your exhibits,
[2525.43s -> 2526.55s]  clicking on a zookeeper
[2526.55s -> 2529.88s]  to open the zookeeper panel.
[2529.88s -> 2530.12s]  Okay.
[2535.99s -> 2539.62s]  This is Keeper Van Houten.
[2539.62s -> 2540.66s]  Staff status panels
[2540.66s -> 2542.79s]  where you see your zookeeper's current duty.
[2542.79s -> 2544.55s]  This is what your zookeeper is doing right now.
[2544.55s -> 2545.03s]  Click the check.
[2545.03s -> 2548.22s]  I can't wait to have a hundred bears in the set.
[2548.22s -> 2548.38s]  No.
[2549.10s -> 2549.26s]  What?
[2549.26s -> 2550.14s]  Are we going too far?
[2550.14s -> 2553.02s]  Slow down.
[2553.02s -> 2554.52s]  Click the check button.
[2554.52s -> 2555.64s]  This is the current duty.
[2555.64s -> 2559.66s]  Staff assignments if your zookeeper has assignments.
[2559.66s -> 2563.96s]  Okay.
[2563.96s -> 2567.08s]  You can assign zookeepers to specific exhibit areas
[2567.08s -> 2568.12s]  but assigning them,
[2568.12s -> 2569.16s]  let's stay there.
[2569.16s -> 2571.70s]  Keep them focused on the exhibits that you select.
[2571.70s -> 2573.78s]  If a zookeeper does not have an assignment,
[2573.78s -> 2575.86s]  they'll just head for an exhibit that needs attention.
[2575.86s -> 2576.66s]  Depending on your zoo,
[2576.66s -> 2578.74s]  this could mean that they do a lot of walking.
[2578.74s -> 2580.73s]  That's okay.
[2580.73s -> 2583.51s]  So here's how you make an assignment.
[2585.42s -> 2586.78s]  Cursor turns into a flag post.
[2586.78s -> 2587.98s]  Place the flag post in your zoo
[2587.98s -> 2589.34s]  to assign a zookeeper to an exhibit area.
[2589.34s -> 2593.34s]  When finished, right-click the mouse to clear the cursor.
[2593.34s -> 2595.58s]  If you assign a zookeeper to more than one exhibit area,
[2595.58s -> 2598.73s]  it may become ineffective.
[2598.73s -> 2600.78s]  Click the check.
[2600.78s -> 2601.50s]  Okay.
[2601.50s -> 2604.30s]  So we realistically only just one here.
[2604.30s -> 2606.14s]  So that's good.
[2606.14s -> 2607.83s]  Staff thoughts.
[2607.83s -> 2608.81s]  I love my job.
[2608.81s -> 2613.69s]  This bench is comfortable.
[2613.69s -> 2614.41s]  Does it?
[2614.41s -> 2615.29s]  Yeah, man.
[2615.29s -> 2618.04s]  That's pretty good.
[2618.04s -> 2619.08s]  That's all you're thinking about.
[2621.10s -> 2622.22s]  This is a comfortable bench.
[2622.22s -> 2624.22s]  I love my job.
[2624.22s -> 2626.82s]  Nothing else?
[2626.82s -> 2630.42s]  That's a pretty clear mind.
[2630.42s -> 2631.62s]  The staff thoughts panel is what you see,
[2631.62s -> 2632.58s]  what you staff are thinking.
[2632.58s -> 2633.78s]  Here you might get a bit of insight on
[2633.78s -> 2635.70s]  whether there is something standing in the way of them
[2635.70s -> 2638.17s]  caring for the animals, right?
[2639.32s -> 2640.36s]  Staff salary.
[2640.36s -> 2642.78s]  This is where you see the salary,
[2642.78s -> 2644.74s]  how long they've been employed.
[2644.74s -> 2648.38s]  $500 a month to be a zookeeper.
[2648.38s -> 2652.28s]  Melissi loves that bench.
[2652.28s -> 2657.72s]  Select a guest.
[2657.72s -> 2658.92s]  Let's move on to the guests.
[2661.91s -> 2662.55s]  Kid.
[2662.55s -> 2665.66s]  Should we do kid or adult?
[2665.66s -> 2668.90s]  How about Railmaster Rex BBQ?
[2668.90s -> 2671.99s]  The guest activities and needs panel shows you
[2671.99s -> 2673.51s]  what the guest is currently doing.
[2673.51s -> 2676.58s]  Okay, yeah.
[2676.58s -> 2677.70s]  Guest needs.
[2677.70s -> 2680.82s]  Need a screen that's satisfied.
[2680.82s -> 2681.94s]  If it's yellow, it's pressing.
[2681.94s -> 2685.19s]  And if it's red, it's critical.
[2685.19s -> 2686.71s]  Going to buy the soda.
[2688.73s -> 2690.01s]  It's fucking Chad.
[2693.46s -> 2699.86s]  Why does Chad have to appear in every video game?
[2699.86s -> 2701.94s]  This is like 15 years ago.
[2701.94s -> 2705.75s]  All right, this is status tab.
[2705.75s -> 2708.95s]  This is hungry, hunger needs, thirst, rest,
[2709.75s -> 2711.86s]  amusement, bathroom.
[2711.86s -> 2713.14s]  Yeah, of course.
[2713.14s -> 2715.62s]  Oh, select guest.
[2715.62s -> 2717.30s]  Wow, this guy's loaded.
[2717.30s -> 2719.45s]  This guy has in his bank account
[2719.45s -> 2721.37s]  the amount of money that this guy,
[2721.37s -> 2723.05s]  my zookeeper makes in a month.
[2723.05s -> 2725.98s]  Jesus.
[2725.98s -> 2728.55s]  That's like a lot of money in this universe.
[2728.55s -> 2732.82s]  On this panel, you can see how much cash to get.
[2732.82s -> 2735.06s]  NileCrocodile1 has been put in a crate.
[2735.78s -> 2736.50s]  Why?
[2736.50s -> 2737.56s]  What did he do?
[2737.56s -> 2739.35s]  I don't know what that means yet.
[2739.35s -> 2742.33s]  If the guest has purchased a souvenir in your zoo,
[2742.33s -> 2743.93s]  click the check button.
[2743.93s -> 2750.01s]  Click on the guest favorites tab.
[2750.01s -> 2751.37s]  They really like camels.
[2751.37s -> 2751.93s]  Okay.
[2751.93s -> 2754.22s]  Guest favorite animal.
[2754.22s -> 2755.50s]  Guests are likely to make larger donations
[2755.50s -> 2757.26s]  if they see their favorite animals.
[2757.26s -> 2758.86s]  So stay on top of your guest favorites.
[2758.86s -> 2760.94s]  You'll reap the reward of money
[2760.94s -> 2764.57s]  coming in from donations and guest thoughts.
[2764.57s -> 2767.69s]  You can see, don't you wish you could read
[2767.69s -> 2768.97s]  everyone's mind this way?
[2768.97s -> 2769.77s]  Not really.
[2769.77s -> 2770.81s]  I really don't.
[2770.81s -> 2774.71s]  I do not wish I could read everybody's mind
[2774.71s -> 2776.87s]  because imagine if you could do that.
[2776.95s -> 2779.67s]  Imagine like just shaking somebody's hand at the bank.
[2779.67s -> 2781.75s]  Like, oh yeah, I'm banker one.
[2781.75s -> 2782.63s]  Oh, hi, I'm guy.
[2782.63s -> 2783.59s]  I'm guy one.
[2783.59s -> 2784.47s]  Oh, nice to meet you.
[2784.47s -> 2785.67s]  And you can read his mind.
[2785.67s -> 2786.31s]  I don't like your nose.
[2786.31s -> 2787.11s]  Your nose is ugly.
[2787.11s -> 2788.23s]  It's just like, what the fuck?
[2788.23s -> 2791.90s]  And then you can't even talk to the guy anymore.
[2791.90s -> 2794.06s]  Or like, oh, I'm welcome to the bank.
[2794.06s -> 2794.62s]  How you doing?
[2794.62s -> 2797.02s]  Like, I'm going to shit my pants.
[2797.02s -> 2797.82s]  I would laugh.
[2797.82s -> 2799.67s]  How would you be able to do anything?
[2799.67s -> 2800.71s]  Nothing would ever work.
[2800.71s -> 2808.52s]  You would never be able to have a conversation ever again.
[2808.52s -> 2810.04s]  If I could read people's minds, I wouldn't.
[2810.04s -> 2814.97s]  No, that's a power I don't want.
[2814.97s -> 2815.21s]  All right.
[2815.21s -> 2817.69s]  So we need to hope the small restroom one line
[2817.69s -> 2818.25s]  moves quickly.
[2818.25s -> 2819.45s]  I really need to use the bathroom.
[2819.45s -> 2820.97s]  I need to throw away this trash.
[2820.97s -> 2822.41s]  I prefer something other than soda.
[2825.10s -> 2827.82s]  I want something other than soda.
[2827.82s -> 2829.42s]  All we got is soda.
[2829.42s -> 2831.82s]  We just have Pepsi.
[2831.82s -> 2835.02s]  That's it.
[2835.02s -> 2835.18s]  All right.
[2835.18s -> 2836.54s]  Select a food stand.
[2836.54s -> 2837.56s]  Yeah.
[2837.56s -> 2839.32s]  Buildings have information as well.
[2839.32s -> 2842.65s]  Which, where are the food stands?
[2842.65s -> 2847.86s]  That's a pretty good zoo setup.
[2847.86s -> 2852.17s]  Here's a status panel.
[2852.17s -> 2853.61s]  It's how much money things are.
[2853.61s -> 2854.17s]  Yep.
[2854.17s -> 2856.94s]  Items being sold.
[2856.94s -> 2859.86s]  Some buildings may display slightly different information.
[2861.43s -> 2862.31s]  Finance tab.
[2862.31s -> 2863.19s]  Let's see how much it is.
[2863.19s -> 2867.91s]  So this is price, low, moderate, or high prices.
[2867.91s -> 2873.05s]  This is the balance sheet, which I will always be in the red for.
[2873.05s -> 2875.35s]  To show whether it's turning a profit or not.
[2875.35s -> 2875.83s]  Yep.
[2875.83s -> 2879.08s]  Get a complete overview about how your zoo is doing.
[2879.08s -> 2880.12s]  The zoo status page.
[2880.12s -> 2881.00s]  Here's the money tab.
[2881.00s -> 2886.95s]  This is going to just, yeah, it's how much money you spent versus how much you've received.
[2886.95s -> 2888.55s]  Mark your zoo is open or closed.
[2888.55s -> 2889.51s]  This is how you open the zoo.
[2889.51s -> 2890.79s]  Good to, that's actually really good to know.
[2896.01s -> 2898.33s]  And an altered level of your admission prices.
[2898.33s -> 2903.34s]  So wait, it costs money to come in and people are expected to give a bunch of money?
[2907.64s -> 2908.60s]  I thought it was okay.
[2911.62s -> 2913.54s]  When you close the zoo, all your guests will begin to leave.
[2913.54s -> 2915.22s]  Click the check button on this panel to continue.
[2916.63s -> 2918.23s]  Income and expenses tab.
[2919.82s -> 2921.74s]  Monthly tally of your financial comings and goings.
[2921.74s -> 2924.70s]  If you're seeing lots of red, your zoo is probably spending more than it's receiving.
[2924.70s -> 2926.30s]  Remember green is good.
[2926.30s -> 2930.30s]  And this is one place where you don't want to be looking through rose colored glasses.
[2931.10s -> 2933.02s]  Click the check button on this panel to continue.
[2934.92s -> 2935.56s]  Zoo fame.
[2936.98s -> 2939.14s]  Shows you how many animals you have, how happy people are.
[2939.70s -> 2941.86s]  There's an award ceremony probably at the end of the year.
[2941.86s -> 2943.54s]  Like in every single one of these video games.
[2944.18s -> 2945.43s]  You can mouse over them.
[2947.32s -> 2949.56s]  The more animals you have in your zoo, the more famous it becomes.
[2949.56s -> 2951.32s]  Animal happiness, guest education.
[2951.96s -> 2955.16s]  Releasing animals into the wild really increase fame for your zoo.
[2957.94s -> 2961.54s]  Does that mean like open the gates to the elephant enclosure and just watch what happens?
[2961.54s -> 2963.06s]  I mean, of course your zoo would be famous.
[2966.98s -> 2968.02s]  I'll release them.
[2968.66s -> 2971.14s]  I'm the omnipotent owner of the zoo.
[2973.18s -> 2976.94s]  Here's like the nuclear launch code to unlock all the doors.
[2976.94s -> 2980.55s]  I'll be so famous.
[2980.55s -> 2981.03s]  All right.
[2981.03s -> 2982.55s]  Zoo quick stats.
[2982.55s -> 2987.78s]  This shows pretty much everything here.
[2987.78s -> 2989.94s]  Illnesses can be very helpful at giving you an overview.
[2990.50s -> 2993.11s]  So crocodile one.
[2993.11s -> 2994.25s]  Uh oh.
[2994.25s -> 2996.49s]  This represents the animals current privacy.
[2996.49s -> 3002.57s]  Animals can use shelters or lion grass or shade to regain their privacy as more guests view them.
[3002.57s -> 3005.40s]  The crocodile wants more privacy.
[3005.40s -> 3006.36s]  I know this is going to be fun.
[3007.67s -> 3007.91s]  All right.
[3007.91s -> 3008.63s]  This guest list.
[3008.63s -> 3009.83s]  It shows everybody all the thing.
[3009.83s -> 3010.95s]  Can't wait to see some animals.
[3013.16s -> 3015.40s]  The camera will jump to that person if you click on it.
[3015.40s -> 3017.32s]  And track the movements of the animal the person selected.
[3017.32s -> 3020.65s]  Maybe another one of those don't you wish you could things.
[3020.65s -> 3022.01s]  Why do you want this?
[3022.01s -> 3024.34s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[3024.34s -> 3027.24s]  The guy that wrote the tutorial.
[3027.24s -> 3032.57s]  You want to read everybody's mind and track everyone.
[3032.57s -> 3041.48s]  Did Mark Zuckerberg make this game?
[3041.48s -> 3046.55s]  Eventually, you know, his superpower started to become a reality.
[3046.55s -> 3053.77s]  We got information on staff.
[3053.77s -> 3055.85s]  You can see everybody, what everybody wants.
[3055.85s -> 3059.64s]  Whereabouts have you staffed in the zoo?
[3060.20s -> 3061.64s]  Camera will jump to that location and over there.
[3061.64s -> 3063.48s]  Stamp information, what you can do.
[3063.48s -> 3064.98s]  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[3064.98s -> 3066.82s]  Waiting for job, waiting for job, waiting for job.
[3066.82s -> 3070.47s]  What the hell was that?
[3070.47s -> 3075.22s]  Which is fucking flashed by my screen.
[3075.22s -> 3076.28s]  Okay.
[3076.28s -> 3077.38s]  All right.
[3077.38s -> 3079.00s]  I think we're ready.
[3079.00s -> 3081.94s]  It's time to learn more about the photo safari.
[3081.94s -> 3082.90s]  Photo mode.
[3082.90s -> 3087.11s]  You can take a picture of this, yeah.
[3087.11s -> 3088.55s]  When a photo challenge is available,
[3088.55s -> 3092.34s]  you can right click to view the challenge.
[3092.34s -> 3095.51s]  Take a picture of a drum dairy camel.
[3095.51s -> 3100.06s]  This challenge asks you to take a picture of a drum dairy camel.
[3100.06s -> 3101.42s]  Think you're up for the challenge.
[3101.42s -> 3105.67s]  You can walk around using the left mouse button of the movie key.
[3105.67s -> 3107.51s]  Locate a camel in your zoo.
[3107.51s -> 3109.91s]  You can adjust the zoom of your camera in and out using the wheel.
[3109.91s -> 3110.63s]  All right.
[3110.63s -> 3114.31s]  What are you doing?
[3114.31s -> 3116.31s]  What the hell are you doing?
[3116.31s -> 3120.25s]  Was that kid just like going to the,
[3120.25s -> 3122.01s]  was that, were you just like pissing over there?
[3122.01s -> 3123.29s]  Hey, not allowed.
[3123.29s -> 3147.34s]  You fucking idiot.
[3147.34s -> 3147.90s]  Why'd you move?
[3147.90s -> 3149.02s]  That was a good photo.
[3149.02s -> 3155.80s]  Photo, yeah.
[3155.80s -> 3159.35s]  This way you can take another look at the picture
[3159.35s -> 3160.79s]  that you took for the photo challenge.
[3160.79s -> 3163.24s]  Right click, photo challenge.
[3163.24s -> 3163.80s]  Got it.
[3163.80s -> 3166.47s]  You can view any of the photographs you've ever taken
[3166.47s -> 3168.47s]  by opening your photo album tab.
[3168.47s -> 3171.78s]  I don't recommend doing this on stream.
[3171.78s -> 3173.75s]  Why?
[3173.75s -> 3175.27s]  For the photo, the photos that you've just taken
[3175.27s -> 3177.75s]  are shown in the film strip below the top of the screen.
[3177.75s -> 3196.81s]  You can click and drag them into empty slots in your photo album.
[3196.81s -> 3199.37s]  30 animals, 10 different boomers,
[3199.37s -> 3201.30s]  hundreds of objects, and more.
[3201.30s -> 3203.30s]  Be sure to refer to the Zoo Tycoon 2 manual
[3203.30s -> 3204.98s]  for even more in-depth information.
[3204.98s -> 3207.85s]  Tutorials are marked with the book icon.
[3207.85s -> 3208.41s]  I'm ready.
[3208.41s -> 3208.97s]  Let's do it.
[3213.75s -> 3216.14s]  Okay, here we go.
[3218.06s -> 3220.46s]  Welcome to the stream, everybody.
[3220.46s -> 3225.00s]  Feel like I have to run on a stage
[3226.78s -> 3230.60s]  and start like screaming and pointing into the audience.
[3230.60s -> 3231.40s]  It's been an hour.
[3231.40s -> 3233.40s]  It's been, holy shit, it's been an hour.
[3233.40s -> 3234.55s]  Whatever.
[3234.55s -> 3235.11s]  We're ready.
[3235.11s -> 3250.44s]  Play, when do we start with the campaign?
[3250.44s -> 3251.24s]  Oh, fuck.
[3254.78s -> 3256.94s]  There's like probably 10 tutorials.
[3261.74s -> 3262.94s]  I don't know how to fucking play.
[3263.82s -> 3264.86s]  Sandbox game?
[3269.80s -> 3270.60s]  Oh, God.
[3273.03s -> 3274.15s]  I'm not ready for this.
[3274.87s -> 3279.32s]  I'm not ready for this.
[3279.32s -> 3279.96s]  No.
[3279.96s -> 3284.02s]  Let's get away with it.
[3284.02s -> 3284.74s]  No tutorial.
[3285.61s -> 3286.73s]  Zookeeper in training.
[3287.29s -> 3290.98s]  See, you have a great opportunity to take over a small zoo,
[3290.98s -> 3292.10s]  but you need to prove that you understand
[3292.10s -> 3294.42s]  that animals have individual biome needs.
[3294.42s -> 3297.22s]  Make sure each animal is moved into its appropriate biome exhibit
[3297.22s -> 3298.82s]  and run your new zoo for one month.
[3299.38s -> 3301.43s]  Complete all scenarios in this campaign
[3301.43s -> 3305.67s]  and you'll get like 50 times somebody's income.
[3306.31s -> 3311.02s]  I need to understand.
[3311.02s -> 3312.94s]  You will play and you'll like it.
[3312.94s -> 3313.42s]  Just wait.
[3313.42s -> 3314.46s]  I need to, let me just get,
[3315.26s -> 3317.10s]  let me just ease into the game.
[3318.71s -> 3320.23s]  $30,000 a month.
[3320.79s -> 3324.52s]  Just let me do this first.
[3324.52s -> 3326.60s]  I need to, I can't just jump into sandbox mode.
[3329.16s -> 3333.16s]  Look, I need to learn the very basics of like color
[3333.16s -> 3335.40s]  and paint and canvases.
[3335.72s -> 3340.28s]  Don't just dump the most expensive tools into my backyard and say,
[3340.28s -> 3342.52s]  I expect the Mona Lisa in 10 minutes.
[3342.52s -> 3343.72s]  So I don't even know how,
[3343.72s -> 3345.48s]  I don't even know what the, what RGB means.
[3345.48s -> 3346.68s]  What does it even stand for?
[3346.68s -> 3351.35s]  All right, great opportunity to take over a small local zoo.
[3352.23s -> 3354.39s]  For however, the current owner wants to be sure
[3354.39s -> 3356.87s]  that you understand that animals have individual needs.
[3356.87s -> 3358.55s]  He's provided you with three animals
[3358.55s -> 3361.29s]  that need to be placed in their appropriate biome exhibit.
[3361.29s -> 3362.57s]  Each animal can be found in a crate
[3362.57s -> 3363.77s]  at the front entrance of your zoo.
[3363.77s -> 3364.41s]  When you select the crate,
[3364.41s -> 3366.41s]  the information panel indicates what kind of animals inside.
[3367.29s -> 3369.77s]  Pick up the crate and move it like any other object.
[3369.77s -> 3372.17s]  To release an animal from its crate, click on crate.
[3372.17s -> 3373.45s]  You need to move and release each animal.
[3373.45s -> 3375.05s]  Yeah, yeah, to verify you can handle the basics.
[3375.05s -> 3376.89s]  You've also been tasked to run the zoo for one month
[3376.89s -> 3377.93s]  and ensure the animals survive.
[3377.93s -> 3379.61s]  Tip, in the interest of keeping your animals alive,
[3379.61s -> 3381.45s]  you want to provide them with food and water.
[3382.41s -> 3385.93s]  I get, I don't, I don't understand.
[3386.73s -> 3388.41s]  Do the things need to eat and drink?
[3389.77s -> 3390.97s]  Release each animal from its crate
[3390.97s -> 3392.33s]  and place an appropriate exhibit.
[3392.33s -> 3394.01s]  That's, I got 15 minutes to do this.
[3394.97s -> 3397.51s]  Okay, I accept the challenge.
[3398.15s -> 3399.48s]  Here we go.
[3399.48s -> 3401.00s]  Welcome to Zoo Tycoon 2.
[3401.64s -> 3408.49s]  Where are those crates?
[3408.49s -> 3424.70s]  These are at the entrance, right?
[3425.26s -> 3431.56s]  Oh, here are the three animals.
[3431.56s -> 3439.75s]  Okay, how do I grab them?
[3439.75s -> 3440.55s]  Where's the music?
[3455.53s -> 3456.81s]  Okay, this is a hippopotamus
[3456.81s -> 3463.48s]  and needs to be in a wetlands biome.
[3463.48s -> 3464.92s]  No, don't, no, no, go back in.
[3468.06s -> 3471.10s]  So this looks pretty wet over here.
[3471.10s -> 3472.38s]  Don't just drop them in the ocean.
[3472.38s -> 3473.02s]  All right, here we go.
[3473.02s -> 3474.62s]  This looks pretty, this is wetlands right here.
[3475.26s -> 3482.09s]  Okay, looks good.
[3482.09s -> 3483.69s]  Let's uncrate the hippopotamus.
[3484.25s -> 3488.06s]  I hope you like your new area.
[3489.80s -> 3491.40s]  We got, this is a polar bear.
[3491.40s -> 3498.44s]  It needs to be in a tundra, which is right here.
[3505.91s -> 3509.03s]  And we need to put the lion into the savanna.
[3509.03s -> 3513.03s]  I did it.
[3513.03s -> 3514.63s]  Polar bear needs more space.
[3514.63s -> 3515.13s]  What?
[3515.51s -> 3516.95s]  Run the zoo for one month
[3516.95s -> 3518.15s]  and ensure that you have all three animals
[3518.15s -> 3519.03s]  in your zoo at the end of the month.
[3519.59s -> 3521.85s]  What do you mean he needs more space?
[3522.49s -> 3526.66s]  Do you have the biggest exhibit here?
[3526.66s -> 3529.22s]  This is, this is enough for like 25 polar bears.
[3530.62s -> 3531.66s]  All right, that's, you're good.
[3532.22s -> 3533.82s]  Let's open the zoo.
[3533.82s -> 3535.75s]  The zoo is open.
[3536.39s -> 3538.52s]  I'm ready to make this first challenge
[3538.52s -> 3540.76s]  and then we can move on to the more difficult tasks.
[3540.76s -> 3541.64s]  All right, so we need buildings.
[3541.64s -> 3547.30s]  I want to get, we need educator podium
[3547.30s -> 3551.35s]  right at the beginning here.
[3551.35s -> 3552.23s]  Now release them.
[3553.16s -> 3557.94s]  I'm not going to release the animals.
[3557.94s -> 3560.26s]  Look, I need to make the person in the video game
[3560.26s -> 3563.06s]  that you walk by in the first five to 10 minutes
[3563.06s -> 3566.66s]  of the story and it's the guy sitting there preaching
[3566.66s -> 3569.06s]  in front of the first, like after the first cut scene
[3569.06s -> 3573.00s]  that you walk by right there.
[3573.00s -> 3576.50s]  Okay, we need an educator.
[3576.50s -> 3583.06s]  There's one person, Jeremy Albertson.
[3583.06s -> 3584.42s]  Holy shit, that was close.
[3584.42s -> 3588.55s]  All right, what do you need?
[3588.55s -> 3590.54s]  I can't wait to see some animals
[3590.54s -> 3591.82s]  going right for the hippopotamus.
[3595.48s -> 3596.52s]  All right, two guests now.
[3596.52s -> 3604.02s]  How much is this place?
[3604.02s -> 3605.30s]  Okay, how much is it?
[3605.30s -> 3606.63s]  $50.
[3606.63s -> 3610.44s]  No, it's, just make it 20 bucks.
[3610.44s -> 3619.30s]  Okay, here's Jim Ben Dixon wants to see a warthog.
[3619.30s -> 3621.62s]  Well, hold on a minute here.
[3621.62s -> 3622.79s]  Warthog.
[3622.79s -> 3626.07s]  Do I have access to warthog?
[3630.04s -> 3631.78s]  Velociraptor.
[3631.78s -> 3634.58s]  Why would a velociraptor be here right now?
[3658.07s -> 3660.10s]  What is he going?
[3660.10s -> 3664.55s]  He's going to take a shit in the corn.
[3664.55s -> 3666.47s]  He's going to kill guests.
[3666.47s -> 3669.42s]  No, I'll take care of this.
[3669.42s -> 3674.07s]  Hey, get out of here.
[3674.07s -> 3687.03s]  Oh, he wants to go in.
[3687.03s -> 3688.07s]  You want to go in there?
[3688.07s -> 3690.81s]  No, you can't go in there yet.
[3690.81s -> 3692.41s]  There's nothing in there.
[3692.41s -> 3697.18s]  He wants to go in and eat the hippopotamus.
[3697.18s -> 3705.11s]  Where is it?
[3705.11s -> 3716.02s]  Does that help?
[3716.02s -> 3717.46s]  Where is he going?
[3717.46s -> 3721.83s]  Uh-oh, there's one random guy.
[3721.83s -> 3727.69s]  Hey, come on in and see our new mascot, the velociraptor.
[3727.69s -> 3736.36s]  This biome is not suitable for velociraptor one.
[3736.36s -> 3737.78s]  What's he thinking about?
[3742.90s -> 3743.62s]  Family tree.
[3743.62s -> 3744.82s]  No family tree yet.
[3744.82s -> 3768.01s]  All right, well, I told you I can't go off the rails yet.
[3768.01s -> 3774.92s]  Get rid of the raptor.
[3774.92s -> 3775.24s]  What do I do?
[3775.24s -> 3775.96s]  How do I get rid of him?
[3775.96s -> 3784.76s]  Hold on.
[3784.76s -> 3786.12s]  Why is there like no audio?
[3786.12s -> 3789.35s]  There's no audio in this game.
[3789.35s -> 3797.66s]  There's no guns in this game.
[3797.66s -> 3799.93s]  Line one is not contained.
[3799.93s -> 3803.21s]  What do you mean line one is not contained?
[3803.21s -> 3806.97s]  Oh, wait, I deleted the fence.
[3809.29s -> 3811.35s]  Uh-oh, uh-oh.
[3811.35s -> 3812.89s]  He's figuring it out.
[3815.58s -> 3816.94s]  I guess I could walk through here.
[3818.12s -> 3823.26s]  Where is he going?
[3823.26s -> 3825.30s]  Where is he going?
[3825.30s -> 3825.94s]  Oh, no.
[3826.66s -> 3827.70s]  Oh, shit.
[3827.70s -> 3828.82s]  He's sprinting.
[3828.82s -> 3830.06s]  Who is he sprinting?
[3830.06s -> 3832.18s]  This guy's going to shit his pants.
[3832.18s -> 3838.90s]  He's like, I can smell it.
[3838.90s -> 3846.84s]  I need to turn the fucking audio up.
[3846.84s -> 3847.96s]  Polar bear is hungry.
[3847.96s -> 3862.49s]  All right, delete game.
[3862.49s -> 3863.37s]  Whatever, save game.
[3871.78s -> 3876.23s]  The whole game closed.
[3876.23s -> 3878.65s]  I need to turn the sound up.
[3878.65s -> 3880.25s]  All you can hear is every so often you hear.
[3881.85s -> 3890.10s]  All right, I'll get in the sandbox.
[3890.10s -> 3891.86s]  I know how the game works.
[3891.86s -> 3896.50s]  There it comes.
[3896.50s -> 3898.26s]  Hopefully, it's not loud when you hear this.
[3899.85s -> 3900.73s]  It probably will be, though.
[3900.73s -> 3901.69s]  So just brace yourself.
[3904.14s -> 3911.56s]  Oh, I told you I knew it.
[3912.12s -> 3913.24s]  I fucking knew it.
[3913.24s -> 3914.20s]  I tried to warn you.
[3914.92s -> 3925.24s]  That's better.
[3925.24s -> 3926.28s]  That's actually kind of loud.
[3927.32s -> 3928.36s]  That's too loud now.
[3929.91s -> 3938.95s]  40 and like 43, 35, 38.
[3941.96s -> 3945.18s]  All right, let's play.
[3945.18s -> 3946.46s]  I don't know how to take care of dinosaurs,
[3946.46s -> 3947.18s]  but I'll figure it out.
[3947.74s -> 3955.58s]  How about no, let's go.
[3955.58s -> 3959.72s]  What's wrong with the world right now?
[3960.36s -> 3961.40s]  What does this take place?
[3962.36s -> 3963.88s]  Half the world is under water.
[3966.09s -> 3966.73s]  Oh shit.
[3970.18s -> 3971.62s]  Is this like post-apocalyptic?
[3972.26s -> 3980.36s]  This is what's left.
[3981.08s -> 3983.64s]  One giant road through Russia.
[3990.76s -> 3991.24s]  Filters.
[3992.89s -> 3993.61s]  All right, let's do.
[3997.75s -> 4000.07s]  We can't just go right to the extinct animals.
[4000.71s -> 4003.19s]  We'll do medium.
[4006.33s -> 4007.61s]  Medium in Western Europe.
[4008.17s -> 4010.89s]  Let me just do something normal.
[4010.89s -> 4011.45s]  You know what I mean?
[4011.45s -> 4013.53s]  No dinosaurs, no aliens.
[4021.96s -> 4022.76s]  Okay, here we go.
[4023.32s -> 4024.71s]  Trying to make my park.
[4027.64s -> 4028.60s]  I don't like this place.
[4032.52s -> 4035.32s]  This is like a 2007 World of Warcraft zone.
[4035.32s -> 4036.52s]  I don't want to do this one.
[4039.86s -> 4040.74s]  All right, well, whatever.
[4040.74s -> 4043.06s]  Let's just, we'll work with what we got.
[4044.78s -> 4046.22s]  Start the process.
[4046.22s -> 4046.94s]  Landscaping.
[4046.94s -> 4053.54s]  I want, let's get some paths here.
[4053.54s -> 4054.10s]  No, no, no, no.
[4054.10s -> 4054.74s]  I want a path.
[4055.46s -> 4057.59s]  There's so many people parked out here
[4057.59s -> 4058.95s]  waiting for this to open.
[4058.95s -> 4063.64s]  What was the pathing tool?
[4064.36s -> 4064.76s]  Right here.
[4065.40s -> 4068.36s]  Okay, so asphalt path.
[4068.36s -> 4069.99s]  I'm going to just simply,
[4070.71s -> 4072.39s]  I'm going to follow the tutorial here.
[4073.03s -> 4074.81s]  I can expand up there later.
[4079.05s -> 4079.85s]  That looks good.
[4079.85s -> 4080.25s]  All right.
[4080.89s -> 4086.57s]  And then we're going to come across this way.
[4087.13s -> 4088.65s]  We're going to have small exhibits.
[4089.93s -> 4091.69s]  Very small, not huge.
[4091.69s -> 4094.73s]  This is, this is going to have rabbits in here.
[4094.73s -> 4096.81s]  If you think I'm going to put lions and polar bears, no.
[4096.81s -> 4099.13s]  We're going to have goats, rabbits,
[4099.93s -> 4101.77s]  and then a couple of pigs.
[4102.41s -> 4114.01s]  This is going to be essentially the
[4114.01s -> 4115.85s]  part of the county fair that you go to
[4117.13s -> 4119.29s]  that has the shitty pumpkin contest
[4119.29s -> 4120.65s]  and then the random pigs.
[4121.21s -> 4122.41s]  No, whoops.
[4122.41s -> 4125.38s]  How do I, how do I delete you?
[4127.96s -> 4129.64s]  This is not, how are people going to get up there?
[4130.36s -> 4133.46s]  That's so ugly.
[4133.46s -> 4134.02s]  What have I done?
[4136.65s -> 4143.64s]  What's the, what's the bulldoze button?
[4143.64s -> 4144.04s]  There it is.
[4144.68s -> 4150.42s]  Okay, that's better.
[4151.06s -> 4157.72s]  But turbo, that side's not, it's not exact.
[4157.72s -> 4158.28s]  That's fine.
[4158.28s -> 4158.68s]  Whatever.
[4158.68s -> 4160.28s]  We just make like a fucking spatula.
[4163.08s -> 4164.28s]  I'll move this one over.
[4170.41s -> 4171.21s]  Now it'll be fine.
[4171.21s -> 4172.73s]  Everyone can relax.
[4172.73s -> 4182.36s]  So that means it needs to be one, two, three, four.
[4182.92s -> 4188.01s]  So we need one, two, we need one, two, three, four.
[4188.97s -> 4190.41s]  One, two, three, four.
[4191.29s -> 4194.12s]  Oh, fuck me.
[4206.07s -> 4206.87s]  What, a turbo?
[4206.87s -> 4208.07s]  You did a good job, man.
[4208.87s -> 4211.67s]  Could I pick a shittier level?
[4211.67s -> 4213.67s]  I just picked a random place in Europe.
[4215.51s -> 4217.43s]  Let's start with the amenities.
[4218.71s -> 4219.99s]  Extinct research lab.
[4221.58s -> 4222.78s]  Entertainer stage.
[4222.78s -> 4223.74s]  Absolutely.
[4223.74s -> 4232.25s]  But this is a dinosaur one though.
[4232.25s -> 4236.68s]  So how we're going to make this is you have to cross this path.
[4237.48s -> 4239.48s]  So you're going to get bang, bang.
[4239.48s -> 4240.60s]  There's no way to go around it.
[4243.38s -> 4244.98s]  You have to go like this.
[4245.78s -> 4251.86s]  And it's going to be a donation box, donation box.
[4253.70s -> 4256.82s]  We're going to start the donation process the second you enter.
[4256.82s -> 4262.89s]  So we got, I need like three, hold on a minute.
[4262.89s -> 4268.97s]  Dino capture team bunker.
[4268.97s -> 4272.58s]  What, what the hell is that?
[4277.61s -> 4280.65s]  Sabertooth tiger, paleontologist.
[4280.65s -> 4282.33s]  We have to have the dinosaur entertainer here.
[4282.89s -> 4285.11s]  How am I going to have on one stage?
[4285.83s -> 4295.08s]  We have to make an entire ensemble children's television show cast.
[4295.72s -> 4305.46s]  That's all you do.
[4305.46s -> 4307.06s]  You just dance forever.
[4307.06s -> 4316.25s]  Coming up next on Disney Jr.
[4318.01s -> 4319.05s]  The dinosaur troop.
[4319.61s -> 4328.74s]  All right, so that's fine.
[4329.67s -> 4331.03s]  Why are they running around wild?
[4332.22s -> 4333.34s]  Now, you know what?
[4333.34s -> 4333.98s]  You're fired.
[4336.38s -> 4336.94s]  You're fired.
[4338.52s -> 4339.00s]  You're fired.
[4339.93s -> 4340.41s]  You're fired.
[4340.41s -> 4342.41s]  Anybody that gets off that stage is fired.
[4353.16s -> 4354.68s]  We found the one employee.
[4354.68s -> 4357.13s]  That was a test.
[4359.27s -> 4365.05s]  That was a test to find out who really was dedicated.
[4365.05s -> 4365.61s]  I'm going to see you.
[4368.46s -> 4369.66s]  Dinosaur Kimmy.
[4371.18s -> 4372.30s]  And that means you get a raise.
[4373.94s -> 4374.66s]  I don't think I can.
[4374.66s -> 4376.42s]  How do I, I can't raise.
[4378.25s -> 4379.05s]  I love my job.
[4379.05s -> 4380.25s]  I hope the crowd likes my show.
[4380.25s -> 4381.21s]  It's time to do a show.
[4387.19s -> 4389.51s]  That's so, that park didn't even open yet.
[4389.51s -> 4396.94s]  All right, hold on.
[4396.94s -> 4399.48s]  Why, why did that happen?
[4399.48s -> 4400.52s]  Why am I in water now?
[4401.08s -> 4402.15s]  Okay.
[4402.15s -> 4403.53s]  All right.
[4403.53s -> 4407.19s]  Now we need, uh, no, stop running away.
[4407.19s -> 4407.59s]  Whatever.
[4407.59s -> 4408.55s]  You'll figure it out.
[4408.55s -> 4409.11s]  Transportation.
[4409.11s -> 4409.83s]  We can do jeeps.
[4411.10s -> 4412.62s]  Jeep vehicle station.
[4412.62s -> 4413.34s]  Are you serious?
[4414.14s -> 4414.86s]  Where did you come from?
[4414.86s -> 4415.10s]  Hold on.
[4415.10s -> 4416.54s]  Did that person just trade?
[4416.54s -> 4418.60s]  We're going to have a jeep.
[4418.60s -> 4419.24s]  It's too much.
[4419.24s -> 4419.56s]  Hold on.
[4422.92s -> 4423.88s]  And you get in here.
[4427.82s -> 4428.94s]  Jeep vehicle station.
[4429.50s -> 4431.70s]  Oh, I gotta get rid of this.
[4436.34s -> 4438.65s]  All right.
[4438.65s -> 4441.67s]  So then now, crossing gate road.
[4443.13s -> 4444.25s]  Click dislike.
[4444.25s -> 4446.09s]  Then place a crossing gate.
[4446.09s -> 4448.65s]  We keep pedestrians from crossing a road where a jeep is.
[4450.23s -> 4454.09s]  Hold on there.
[4454.09s -> 4456.81s]  Which allows jeep vehicles to enter and exit animal exhibits.
[4456.81s -> 4457.45s]  Holy shit.
[4464.82s -> 4466.02s]  This is going to be so boring.
[4471.38s -> 4472.02s]  No, undo.
[4486.01s -> 4487.21s]  Oh, come on, man.
[4488.52s -> 4489.48s]  I'm trying to move.
[4491.34s -> 4492.38s]  I'm trying to move this.
[4499.70s -> 4501.14s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[4502.02s -> 4502.74s]  Why?
[4502.74s -> 4502.98s]  What?
[4511.26s -> 4512.33s]  Okay.
[4512.33s -> 4512.81s]  Here we go.
[4527.02s -> 4528.62s]  I can't beat that.
[4528.62s -> 4529.82s]  Just absolutely.
[4531.72s -> 4534.36s]  I mean, giving people a chance.
[4535.16s -> 4539.96s]  All right.
[4539.96s -> 4542.20s]  Jeep transportation circuit is complete.
[4543.75s -> 4543.99s]  All right.
[4543.99s -> 4544.71s]  So let's put in.
[4545.51s -> 4549.91s]  We gotta have at least one.
[4553.83s -> 4554.23s]  All right.
[4554.23s -> 4554.71s]  Here we go.
[4560.55s -> 4562.66s]  I don't think I can put one here.
[4565.22s -> 4566.90s]  This is going to get so backed up.
[4569.05s -> 4570.33s]  This ride is going to take forever.
[4576.52s -> 4579.24s]  Two strands of Sky Team cable.
[4580.12s -> 4580.52s]  What?
[4580.52s -> 4582.04s]  You can do a cable car too?
[4582.04s -> 4587.16s]  Oh, this is just a lawsuit.
[4587.16s -> 4589.59s]  We just need to see what happens.
[4589.59s -> 4589.91s]  All right.
[4590.86s -> 4593.74s]  Uh, so you got the two dinosaurs
[4593.74s -> 4594.62s]  running around in circles.
[4595.18s -> 4595.90s]  Tank building.
[4598.62s -> 4599.50s]  Wall for water.
[4600.30s -> 4603.10s]  This is why I didn't want all the painters tools.
[4603.82s -> 4607.08s]  This is why I didn't want all the tools at once.
[4607.80s -> 4609.94s]  All right.
[4609.94s -> 4612.34s]  Let's make some, let's make some habitats.
[4613.22s -> 4619.03s]  So this is going to be, let's get a, okay.
[4619.03s -> 4619.35s]  Fence.
[4620.07s -> 4624.49s]  This is chain link fence on a tight budget.
[4624.49s -> 4627.61s]  I mean, we're not, but just that's fine.
[4628.33s -> 4629.05s]  Let's go here.
[4631.21s -> 4637.16s]  That looks good.
[4638.84s -> 4639.56s]  Get an entrance.
[4645.06s -> 4647.06s]  Another, let's just do chain link fence for now.
[4650.63s -> 4652.63s]  Oh, whoops.
[4655.43s -> 4656.95s]  So it has to go down to here.
[4661.77s -> 4664.57s]  That's enough room for a half of a chimpanzee.
[4665.61s -> 4667.69s]  Well, that's fine because it's not the right climate.
[4671.69s -> 4673.77s]  These are tiny, but that's for the gerbil.
[4678.09s -> 4682.09s]  Look, I'm just trying to, this isn't set in stone yet.
[4682.09s -> 4682.33s]  Okay.
[4682.97s -> 4687.02s]  I just want to make sure I know what I'm doing.
[4693.26s -> 4702.70s]  We can make habitats and staff members.
[4702.70s -> 4703.18s]  There you go.
[4708.44s -> 4709.56s]  Just directionless.
[4713.26s -> 4714.46s]  Absolutely no direction.
[4715.02s -> 4716.79s]  It doesn't know what time it is.
[4716.79s -> 4717.59s]  It doesn't know what day it is.
[4718.31s -> 4723.53s]  It doesn't know the last time.
[4729.61s -> 4733.53s]  I told you, I told you, I can't see in the suit that well.
[4734.33s -> 4737.14s]  He's just running into shit.
[4741.40s -> 4743.16s]  He doesn't have eye holes.
[4743.16s -> 4744.52s]  What is he doing?
[4744.52s -> 4745.56s]  He's just panicking.
[4746.28s -> 4749.64s]  I only know how to do one thing.
[4750.44s -> 4751.98s]  Might as well do the one thing I know.
[4752.54s -> 4755.59s]  Look at that sweat mark.
[4758.90s -> 4759.30s]  Okay.
[4759.30s -> 4760.90s]  So we need a couple more of these habitats.
[4761.54s -> 4772.39s]  Do I need somebody to drive?
[4772.39s -> 4772.63s]  Okay.
[4772.63s -> 4773.03s]  There we go.
[4773.75s -> 4774.47s]  Now, animals.
[4774.47s -> 4775.11s]  Let's see what we got.
[4776.26s -> 4777.06s]  Armadillo.
[4777.06s -> 4778.34s]  I mean, that's not a cool animal.
[4778.98s -> 4780.65s]  We need small animals.
[4780.65s -> 4781.45s]  So beaver.
[4783.62s -> 4784.34s]  Beaver would work.
[4786.89s -> 4787.61s]  I need rabbits.
[4790.68s -> 4791.32s]  Here, what's this?
[4792.36s -> 4792.76s]  Fox.
[4792.76s -> 4793.56s]  That's a little too big.
[4794.20s -> 4799.56s]  Oh, there's turkeys.
[4799.56s -> 4799.88s]  Okay.
[4800.84s -> 4801.80s]  Maybe a bunch of turkeys.
[4803.11s -> 4805.35s]  It's penguins.
[4809.96s -> 4811.40s]  There's so many different animals.
[4812.04s -> 4820.63s]  Now, let's start small because I was supposed to start small.
[4823.77s -> 4824.33s]  Ostrich.
[4825.13s -> 4825.37s]  No.
[4826.81s -> 4827.13s]  Beaver.
[4827.13s -> 4828.01s]  We need something a little.
[4828.01s -> 4828.73s]  Fox is fine.
[4828.73s -> 4829.37s]  Fox is a little.
[4830.09s -> 4831.05s]  I don't need that much space.
[4833.64s -> 4840.47s]  A water loving rodent from North America needs wetlands biome.
[4841.54s -> 4841.78s]  Okay.
[4842.42s -> 4844.10s]  So let's make wetlands biome.
[4846.86s -> 4847.98s]  We need wetlands.
[4850.78s -> 4852.38s]  That's going to be the main attraction, by the way.
[4852.38s -> 4861.40s]  And this is going to make some water.
[4862.89s -> 4864.17s]  Like shallow water over here.
[4865.51s -> 4866.47s]  And then make it a little deep.
[4867.19s -> 4870.01s]  Make it shallow in the ends.
[4870.01s -> 4870.41s]  Oops.
[4878.15s -> 4878.39s]  All right.
[4878.39s -> 4878.87s]  Looks good.
[4880.20s -> 4882.04s]  Deep, shallow, and then dirt.
[4882.04s -> 4883.82s]  We need, let's go like that.
[4884.54s -> 4885.18s]  All right.
[4885.18s -> 4887.26s]  Putting our first animal in the exhibit.
[4888.68s -> 4889.56s]  American beaver.
[4890.76s -> 4903.18s]  An American beaver in Europe.
[4903.18s -> 4903.74s]  That's too many.
[4904.66s -> 4905.22s]  You're fired.
[4905.78s -> 4908.89s]  They need more space.
[4915.16s -> 4926.63s]  No, don't let them out.
[4941.02s -> 4944.62s]  Now we just got to get rid of these fences here and extend the habitat.
[4944.62s -> 4950.78s]  There you go, guys.
[4950.78s -> 4954.57s]  Okay.
[4954.57s -> 4955.37s]  Habitat.
[4955.37s -> 4956.01s]  Wetlands.
[4956.89s -> 4959.00s]  Ah, I know.
[4959.00s -> 4959.40s]  Don't worry.
[4962.63s -> 4964.23s]  That's not enough space for you.
[4964.23s -> 4979.83s]  How is there a guest in here?
[4979.83s -> 4983.38s]  How did you get in here?
[4983.38s -> 4984.10s]  Why are you angry?
[4984.10s -> 4984.90s]  Who the fuck are you?
[4988.34s -> 4989.38s]  This park's not even open.
[4993.90s -> 4996.06s]  It doesn't look like American beaver has enough space.
[4996.06s -> 4997.26s]  American beaver looks unhappy.
[4997.26s -> 4997.98s]  I'm going home.
[5008.18s -> 5011.70s]  This park is, did you let, is this like the dinosaur's family?
[5011.70s -> 5012.42s]  No, it's closed.
[5012.42s -> 5014.92s]  Get out of here.
[5014.92s -> 5016.60s]  One of these idiots opened the park.
[5016.60s -> 5021.61s]  Okay, hold on.
[5021.61s -> 5025.64s]  Let's get some food here.
[5025.64s -> 5027.72s]  Animal food for a beaver.
[5029.05s -> 5031.82s]  I need, oh wait, I need a zookeeper.
[5032.38s -> 5036.57s]  Let's get a couple of zookeepers.
[5036.57s -> 5039.53s]  Why the fuck are you running away?
[5039.53s -> 5041.53s]  How do you need more space than this?
[5042.17s -> 5045.58s]  Okay.
[5045.58s -> 5046.06s]  Food.
[5046.06s -> 5047.18s]  What does, what does beaver eat?
[5047.74s -> 5051.62s]  I need to like click on their tab here.
[5052.63s -> 5053.35s]  All right.
[5053.35s -> 5056.31s]  Uh, space is critical.
[5056.31s -> 5057.66s]  What are you doing?
[5057.66s -> 5059.42s]  Are you breaking up shit in the bottom?
[5059.42s -> 5060.22s]  Are they dead?
[5062.60s -> 5064.44s]  Why are they lying down?
[5064.44s -> 5066.84s]  Are they breaking shit up on the bottom of the ocean?
[5075.62s -> 5077.21s]  Okay, hold on, hold on.
[5077.21s -> 5087.64s]  Deep water.
[5087.64s -> 5088.52s]  That's not deep enough.
[5089.16s -> 5093.74s]  The zoo only has beavers.
[5093.74s -> 5098.30s]  Well, the zoo only has beavers because it, they're angry with me.
[5098.86s -> 5103.14s]  This one's happy.
[5103.86s -> 5104.66s]  All right, we need food.
[5106.84s -> 5108.52s]  We need branches.
[5108.52s -> 5110.36s]  So we can put like branches here.
[5113.69s -> 5114.89s]  Hollow log with lettuce.
[5114.89s -> 5116.25s]  Oh, they're all going for it.
[5116.25s -> 5116.81s]  Quick.
[5116.81s -> 5118.33s]  It's a race to get the food.
[5119.51s -> 5120.79s]  Who's the alpha beaver?
[5125.58s -> 5128.28s]  Uh, lettuce pile.
[5128.28s -> 5130.34s]  There we go.
[5130.34s -> 5131.06s]  See now they're happy.
[5133.98s -> 5134.54s]  Food, dish.
[5135.18s -> 5143.69s]  They really are fighting each other.
[5144.25s -> 5146.15s]  All right.
[5146.15s -> 5147.67s]  They need more space though.
[5147.67s -> 5149.27s]  Is this going to be just a beaver zoo?
[5150.07s -> 5154.55s]  Look, pile of branches.
[5154.55s -> 5155.75s]  You guys can like play over here.
[5159.11s -> 5159.83s]  Animal shelters.
[5159.83s -> 5161.03s]  They don't need an animal shelter.
[5161.03s -> 5166.31s]  They're, they, they, they need more land.
[5167.03s -> 5168.94s]  Okay.
[5168.94s -> 5170.46s]  Well, I'll take down this shit then.
[5171.45s -> 5172.33s]  You need more land?
[5172.33s -> 5172.89s]  Pause the game.
[5173.53s -> 5174.49s]  I'll give you more land.
[5190.38s -> 5196.20s]  I get complaints now.
[5198.52s -> 5200.04s]  Then I'm going to be very upset.
[5201.13s -> 5201.93s]  Wetlands.
[5201.93s -> 5202.97s]  Go with the grass.
[5202.97s -> 5204.97s]  Let's extend the big pool.
[5206.01s -> 5213.19s]  Let's do, let's get shallow water this way.
[5219.16s -> 5221.00s]  Because then I'll do deep here.
[5221.00s -> 5222.36s]  So they can at least hang out over there.
[5223.32s -> 5230.52s]  Oh, the stupid fucking thing's in the way.
[5231.64s -> 5235.46s]  Okay.
[5236.42s -> 5237.22s]  Shallow water.
[5238.10s -> 5240.42s]  American beaver is not contained.
[5240.42s -> 5241.54s]  Well, it's, the game's paused.
[5241.54s -> 5242.10s]  Everything's fine.
[5242.66s -> 5246.31s]  All right, here we go.
[5247.11s -> 5250.71s]  We need to get this one closed in.
[5251.83s -> 5254.33s]  And then this needs to be closed in.
[5256.62s -> 5258.22s]  I don't, why did I even build this?
[5259.90s -> 5260.70s]  The road thing.
[5261.26s -> 5262.78s]  I was just, I'm like a child.
[5263.66s -> 5264.90s]  I had to make it.
[5267.70s -> 5268.26s]  All right.
[5268.26s -> 5269.14s]  That's enclosed.
[5269.94s -> 5270.98s]  I'm ready to turn it back on.
[5273.02s -> 5274.38s]  Let's get some food in here for them.
[5274.94s -> 5277.75s]  Okay.
[5277.75s -> 5278.47s]  Mr. Ranger.
[5278.47s -> 5281.53s]  We've got, uh, let's, the food.
[5281.53s -> 5286.04s]  Let's put some rocks.
[5286.04s -> 5287.16s]  Let's give them a couple of rocks.
[5287.80s -> 5289.34s]  That's too big of a rock.
[5289.34s -> 5290.70s]  That's also too big of a rock.
[5291.26s -> 5292.38s]  Just get like two or three, like,
[5292.38s -> 5294.06s]  dinosaur droppings over here for you to play with.
[5294.86s -> 5295.82s]  Uh, plants.
[5296.62s -> 5299.83s]  All right.
[5299.83s -> 5302.55s]  Uh, a little log that I'm sure they're going to love that.
[5304.15s -> 5305.51s]  And then let's get some toys.
[5308.09s -> 5309.29s]  This doesn't go in the water.
[5309.29s -> 5310.89s]  It goes just like going to the edge here.
[5311.45s -> 5312.41s]  We'll put one down here.
[5314.46s -> 5315.66s]  Uh, Misty Spring.
[5316.38s -> 5318.50s]  That's a huge log.
[5321.72s -> 5322.76s]  Beavers love logs.
[5322.76s -> 5324.20s]  Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
[5324.20s -> 5325.08s]  Right in the corner here.
[5325.80s -> 5329.40s]  And then we need, I think we need more food.
[5331.13s -> 5332.41s]  Hollow log with lettuce.
[5332.41s -> 5334.65s]  Yeah, we'll put the, that's like a little snack for them over here.
[5335.99s -> 5336.47s]  All right.
[5336.47s -> 5337.27s]  No more complaints.
[5339.43s -> 5346.34s]  Why do they sound like pigs?
[5347.66s -> 5347.90s]  All right.
[5347.90s -> 5348.54s]  What can I see?
[5348.54s -> 5349.02s]  What do you need?
[5350.20s -> 5351.32s]  Comfortable the animal is.
[5352.36s -> 5353.32s]  Hygiene needs.
[5354.87s -> 5355.11s]  All right.
[5355.11s -> 5355.59s]  We're good.
[5357.11s -> 5359.11s]  This is just barely big enough for them, by the way.
[5359.91s -> 5360.15s]  How?
[5361.82s -> 5362.62s]  Social needs.
[5363.42s -> 5366.28s]  They need to be social with other animals.
[5367.16s -> 5369.91s]  Current simulation level.
[5370.47s -> 5372.84s]  They'll spread out.
[5374.10s -> 5374.98s]  Expand.
[5375.80s -> 5377.16s]  I thought I can't expand.
[5378.52s -> 5380.12s]  This is not going to be Beaver Park.
[5383.14s -> 5386.17s]  This is a great exhibit right here.
[5386.17s -> 5388.28s]  How is it?
[5388.28s -> 5389.08s]  How are you not contained?
[5389.08s -> 5389.64s]  You're in here.
[5391.30s -> 5391.86s]  Social.
[5396.07s -> 5396.87s]  What's your problem?
[5398.17s -> 5399.61s]  Put it up for adoption.
[5400.41s -> 5402.66s]  I need more fresh trees.
[5406.58s -> 5406.82s]  All right.
[5406.82s -> 5408.10s]  Let's put in some fresh trees.
[5408.82s -> 5411.19s]  Where's the ranger?
[5411.19s -> 5413.03s]  I need ranger to tell me, uh, some help me here.
[5413.59s -> 5413.83s]  All right.
[5413.83s -> 5414.55s]  American Beaver.
[5416.87s -> 5418.15s]  Uh, tree.
[5419.35s -> 5419.59s]  All right.
[5419.59s -> 5420.47s]  Here we go.
[5420.86s -> 5431.62s]  They're going to have you get one, two trees and that should be good.
[5435.91s -> 5437.27s]  They're all females.
[5437.27s -> 5437.91s]  What?
[5437.91s -> 5446.34s]  What do you mean they're all female?
[5446.34s -> 5448.02s]  I only put in females?
[5453.02s -> 5468.36s]  Uh, that's it.
[5468.36s -> 5472.38s]  And that was enough to make it fine.
[5472.38s -> 5481.54s]  I just deleted a beaver.
[5481.54s -> 5482.74s]  I think I just killed a beaver.
[5483.38s -> 5484.52s]  I just killed a beaver.
[5484.52s -> 5494.12s]  I think they're going to kill each other.
[5494.12s -> 5494.76s]  No, they're not.
[5495.48s -> 5497.74s]  This is part one.
[5498.30s -> 5500.82s]  I'm going to delete this stupid fucking thing.
[5500.82s -> 5502.26s]  And that's going to make more room.
[5502.26s -> 5507.06s]  I'll put some food and, and drinks down here.
[5507.06s -> 5508.66s]  Over here is going to be the entrance with dinosaurs.
[5508.66s -> 5510.42s]  It's going to be two dinosaur dancers.
[5510.42s -> 5511.22s]  And then we're going to go up.
[5511.22s -> 5514.02s]  We're going to take a little monorail up this way.
[5514.02s -> 5515.46s]  It's not just going to be Beaver Park.
[5520.55s -> 5523.51s]  It's be it's the Beaver Park for the first five seconds.
[5524.07s -> 5535.43s]  Contain it.
[5535.43s -> 5536.15s]  Just contain it.
[5536.95s -> 5539.69s]  I build this later.
[5541.13s -> 5547.40s]  American Beaver is not contained.
[5548.84s -> 5550.04s]  It will be very soon.
[5550.04s -> 5550.36s]  Okay.
[5550.36s -> 5551.40s]  Here we go.
[5551.40s -> 5552.60s]  Let's actually get this built.
[5554.57s -> 5557.29s]  And then I'm going to do extend the water.
[5557.29s -> 5559.69s]  And then I'm going to have a little island over here for them to hang out.
[5559.69s -> 5562.81s]  And on the island is going to be a fucking grizzly bear.
[5562.81s -> 5565.30s]  So good luck beavers.
[5565.30s -> 5569.22s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, it's not going to happen.
[5569.78s -> 5576.10s]  Hey, you know, like I said, I wasn't going to go off the rails or the first like hour.
[5577.67s -> 5578.71s]  I wonder what happened with that.
[5581.86s -> 5582.74s]  Oh, this is too far.
[5586.68s -> 5588.52s]  Right here, right here.
[5590.07s -> 5590.87s]  Is that enough?
[5591.51s -> 5592.71s]  How many beavers do I have?
[5594.71s -> 5595.75s]  I haven't even checked that.
[5598.06s -> 5598.70s]  Wetlands.
[5599.50s -> 5600.86s]  Quick to include plants.
[5604.46s -> 5605.02s]  Oh, wait, I can.
[5606.58s -> 5607.54s]  Oh, hold on a minute here.
[5609.24s -> 5611.16s]  Oh, it does it automatically.
[5611.16s -> 5611.80s]  Would you look at that?
[5613.24s -> 5619.48s]  See, but we need water.
[5622.90s -> 5625.38s]  It's making little lily pads for them.
[5626.10s -> 5627.78s]  I need it.
[5627.78s -> 5629.38s]  I want like a little hangout zone here though.
[5634.09s -> 5635.37s]  Like they can come over to the other shore.
[5635.37s -> 5636.33s]  They can swim to the other shore.
[5637.13s -> 5639.98s]  All right.
[5639.98s -> 5641.18s]  Let's put food over here.
[5641.18s -> 5641.82s]  What's this thing?
[5642.70s -> 5643.90s]  No, I don't want to do that.
[5643.90s -> 5647.34s]  Let's get some food over here.
[5651.27s -> 5652.15s]  Needs more space.
[5652.15s -> 5653.11s]  You'll get it in a second.
[5653.11s -> 5658.04s]  How about, uh, let's put some food dish with roots.
[5658.04s -> 5659.32s]  Now let's put, how many do we have?
[5661.40s -> 5664.04s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.
[5664.04s -> 5665.96s]  There's like fourteen or like fifteen.
[5666.60s -> 5676.86s]  Let's go see.
[5677.85s -> 5678.33s]  Look at that.
[5679.46s -> 5687.37s]  And, and there's going to be a fun log over here.
[5687.37s -> 5690.38s]  They're enclosed, right?
[5690.38s -> 5691.10s]  What do you say now?
[5713.69s -> 5714.57s]  They need more space.
[5725.00s -> 5725.88s]  Move triangle.
[5725.88s -> 5726.28s]  Hold on.
[5726.28s -> 5726.60s]  Hold on.
[5726.60s -> 5727.00s]  Hold on.
[5727.00s -> 5728.28s]  I'm going to remove the triangle.
[5728.92s -> 5734.98s]  I need more space.
[5734.98s -> 5735.94s]  How many are in here?
[5745.99s -> 5746.47s]  All right.
[5746.47s -> 5747.03s]  I'm sorry.
[5751.64s -> 5752.36s]  How do I pick?
[5755.98s -> 5762.98s]  No, these are like pigs.
[5764.22s -> 5765.42s]  No, I don't want to get rid of this one.
[5765.42s -> 5766.14s]  This one's fun.
[5767.32s -> 5769.48s]  This one's, oh, I like them all.
[5771.78s -> 5772.58s]  All right.
[5772.58s -> 5779.03s]  How do I, uh, how do I put them up for adoption?
[5785.62s -> 5786.42s]  I did it.
[5786.42s -> 5788.18s]  I think I did it.
[5788.18s -> 5789.06s]  No, I didn't.
[5789.06s -> 5792.68s]  Did I do it?
[5792.68s -> 5793.16s]  How?
[5793.16s -> 5794.36s]  You still need space.
[5796.97s -> 5798.33s]  I'm trying to fire the beavers.
[5799.90s -> 5800.78s]  They still need space.
[5803.11s -> 5804.07s]  Oh, okay.
[5804.07s -> 5806.60s]  Look at that.
[5806.60s -> 5811.59s]  Done.
[5811.59s -> 5812.31s]  Very cool.
[5812.31s -> 5812.79s]  Very cool.
[5815.46s -> 5815.78s]  Okay.
[5817.11s -> 5820.47s]  So now, interestingly enough, okay.
[5821.91s -> 5836.78s]  Let's, um, I'm just kidding.
[5837.50s -> 5837.90s]  Let's go.
[5841.29s -> 5842.25s]  Spin out their numbers.
[5842.25s -> 5843.53s]  Put in a crocodile.
[5843.53s -> 5845.85s]  No, I'm not going to fuck with the beaver exhibit.
[5845.85s -> 5846.81s]  It's the best thing we got.
[5848.86s -> 5849.58s]  Okay.
[5849.58s -> 5853.82s]  I've been doing this for so long.
[5854.46s -> 5866.87s]  Get out of here.
[5867.93s -> 5868.25s]  All right.
[5868.25s -> 5871.45s]  Now we need, um, we have our beaver exhibit.
[5871.45s -> 5874.09s]  Is that worth $50 to come in and see shitty beavers?
[5874.65s -> 5885.78s]  Let's go back to this.
[5892.89s -> 5896.95s]  I can't just have it drive through the exhibit, guys.
[5896.95s -> 5898.31s]  I just started.
[5898.31s -> 5904.46s]  I can't ruin everything.
[5904.46s -> 5905.34s]  You know what I mean?
[5905.34s -> 5906.46s]  We need to at least make this.
[5909.62s -> 5911.22s]  I can't do that right now.
[5912.94s -> 5913.98s]  That's too much.
[5914.54s -> 5921.66s]  Maybe it, that's not safe, apparently.
[5927.91s -> 5928.63s]  There we go.
[5928.63s -> 5932.25s]  It just needs to go around it.
[5935.56s -> 5936.68s]  People still need to,
[5937.40s -> 5939.40s]  I need an enjoyable ride in this park.
[5940.20s -> 5942.94s]  You understand?
[5945.62s -> 5946.66s]  Everything here sucks.
[5947.38s -> 5948.26s]  Nothing here is good.
[5948.82s -> 5949.46s]  Everything sucks.
[5954.38s -> 5957.42s]  You drive around in a go-kart around a beaver exhibit and it's 50 bucks.
[5958.22s -> 5959.10s]  Actually, that's kind of cool.
[5959.90s -> 5961.26s]  That actually is pretty cool.
[5961.26s -> 5961.74s]  Never mind.
[5962.30s -> 5964.26s]  Staying corrected by myself.
[5964.26s -> 5964.58s]  All right.
[5964.58s -> 5965.54s]  Uh, open it.
[5967.10s -> 5967.98s]  Click to close the station.
[5967.98s -> 5969.74s]  No guests can enter when the station is closed.
[5969.74s -> 5974.55s]  I think we need, but can we use it?
[5974.55s -> 5975.59s]  Incomplete circuit.
[5975.59s -> 5976.39s]  Oh, it's because of this.
[5981.58s -> 5983.13s]  Okay, I need to build.
[5987.83s -> 5988.87s]  Change circuit direction.
[5989.59s -> 5990.07s]  That's fine.
[5992.89s -> 5994.09s]  So this should complete the circuit.
[5996.30s -> 5997.42s]  Incomplete circuit.
[5997.42s -> 5997.92s]  Where?
[6003.86s -> 6004.36s]  Fuck.
[6006.28s -> 6006.78s]  Oh well.
[6007.32s -> 6019.75s]  Stupid motherfucker.
[6041.96s -> 6043.02s]  Okay.
[6046.78s -> 6047.28s]  Open.
[6047.58s -> 6048.46s]  So how do we test it?
[6048.46s -> 6050.22s]  What kind of jeep do we want to use?
[6051.21s -> 6057.59s]  Definitely the Jurassic Park one.
[6057.59s -> 6059.51s]  Click select and then place the decorated jeep.
[6060.23s -> 6061.78s]  Yeah, place it, man.
[6062.42s -> 6063.94s]  I should know this one.
[6065.10s -> 6065.60s]  This one.
[6066.78s -> 6076.47s]  How many can I have?
[6076.47s -> 6078.71s]  I guess I can have like more than five.
[6079.35s -> 6082.49s]  Nobody who's even in these.
[6083.88s -> 6085.56s]  I'm wasting so much money.
[6086.20s -> 6090.98s]  Are these guys going to never end just drive around the track with nobody?
[6092.28s -> 6092.84s]  Can I get in?
[6093.64s -> 6096.95s]  How do I get in?
[6098.76s -> 6100.12s]  Wait, I own the place.
[6100.12s -> 6100.62s]  Let me in.
[6108.15s -> 6108.87s]  Oh, I can get on.
[6109.43s -> 6113.48s]  See, we're taking a tour of Beaver Park.
[6114.20s -> 6119.94s]  What's this guy's problem?
[6119.94s -> 6120.66s]  Get back to work.
[6121.30s -> 6126.41s]  What's going on?
[6129.72s -> 6130.92s]  What's happening here?
[6130.92s -> 6132.84s]  Hey, how do I beep the horn?
[6141.32s -> 6142.28s]  Actual traffic.
[6143.08s -> 6143.96s]  What's the issue here?
[6148.68s -> 6150.36s]  Oh, look at how cute that is.
[6150.36s -> 6151.72s]  Pick with my photo.
[6151.72s -> 6166.55s]  I missed it.
[6171.10s -> 6171.82s]  How do I fix this?
[6172.38s -> 6172.88s]  Okay.
[6174.65s -> 6176.25s]  The terrain is impassable.
[6176.25s -> 6179.88s]  How do I take care of that?
[6179.88s -> 6180.52s]  All right.
[6180.52s -> 6181.48s]  I think I know how to take care of it.
[6197.82s -> 6199.66s]  Capacity six.
[6199.66s -> 6200.16s]  Capacity.
[6200.32s -> 6212.65s]  So, that's the ride there.
[6212.65s -> 6214.89s]  Looking good.
[6214.89s -> 6215.29s]  Watch out.
[6215.29s -> 6215.61s]  Watch out.
[6215.61s -> 6216.49s]  Watch out.
[6216.49s -> 6223.88s]  And now we just need guests to ride in the gigantic Jurassic Park funeral caravan, apparently.
[6224.60s -> 6228.35s]  This is just like...
[6236.94s -> 6237.26s]  I thought...
[6237.26s -> 6238.22s]  Didn't I fire you?
[6238.86s -> 6239.55s]  Oh, no.
[6239.55s -> 6240.11s]  You're the other one.
[6242.76s -> 6243.88s]  Dino is back.
[6244.44s -> 6244.92s]  All right.
[6244.92s -> 6245.80s]  We're good.
[6245.80s -> 6247.80s]  So now I got to make some decent roads.
[6248.36s -> 6260.68s]  Let's go up here because this will take you then straight through and then up here into
[6260.68s -> 6267.50s]  the next exhibit, which we will determine what that is very soon.
[6268.14s -> 6270.38s]  I don't know what the hell it's going to be, but it's going to be right here.
[6274.60s -> 6274.92s]  Okay.
[6275.79s -> 6276.35s]  Looking good.
[6276.91s -> 6278.46s]  So, at this point...
[6279.42s -> 6280.14s]  What the fuck?
[6282.36s -> 6284.68s]  Okay.
[6284.68s -> 6285.32s]  That looks fine.
[6287.69s -> 6288.49s]  Zoo does...
[6288.49s -> 6289.29s]  I don't want to open it yet.
[6289.29s -> 6289.53s]  I need...
[6290.97s -> 6292.25s]  That guy just fell out of the gate.
[6292.81s -> 6294.33s]  Wait, he swam to the gate.
[6294.33s -> 6294.65s]  The gate...
[6294.65s -> 6295.37s]  Where's the gate?
[6297.88s -> 6299.16s]  Oh, for the love of God.
[6302.59s -> 6303.87s]  I need more than one gate.
[6304.67s -> 6305.55s]  Do they have food in here?
[6308.88s -> 6309.20s]  Where?
[6309.92s -> 6315.21s]  I feel like this is a people habitat as much as it is a beaver one.
[6315.77s -> 6316.33s]  Watch out.
[6316.33s -> 6316.81s]  Watch out.
[6316.81s -> 6317.29s]  Watch out.
[6320.49s -> 6320.89s]  Watch out.
[6320.89s -> 6327.85s]  I have 25 employees whose job it is just to drive in a circle all day.
[6327.85s -> 6341.37s]  So they can't be hurt.
[6341.37s -> 6342.25s]  That's good.
[6342.25s -> 6343.21s]  That's very good to know.
[6346.52s -> 6346.76s]  All right.
[6346.76s -> 6354.12s]  So now I'm like lost on what I want to do next here.
[6357.26s -> 6364.44s]  Let's make this a double just so there's enough room for people to watch.
[6364.44s -> 6366.12s]  I want to have a donation exhibit here.
[6366.84s -> 6370.51s]  I need some food, some stalls.
[6371.23s -> 6378.01s]  Let's try to get around this somehow.
[6380.99s -> 6381.71s]  That has to go.
[6389.47s -> 6390.35s]  I'm so...
[6390.35s -> 6392.91s]  I'm so glad that they can't get run over.
[6397.95s -> 6400.75s]  It's just a beaver prison.
[6401.31s -> 6402.11s]  No, it's not.
[6402.75s -> 6406.14s]  This is making me so nervous.
[6406.14s -> 6408.06s]  I feel like someone's going to get fucking run over.
[6413.63s -> 6417.79s]  It's a beaver prison that is being constantly patrolled.
[6422.09s -> 6423.69s]  Like a caravan of staff.
[6423.69s -> 6424.01s]  Okay.
[6424.81s -> 6431.13s]  People can cross that.
[6431.13s -> 6431.53s]  That's fine.
[6436.57s -> 6438.09s]  High security.
[6438.09s -> 6439.37s]  High security for the beavers.
[6439.93s -> 6441.74s]  Make sure nobody gets out of there.
[6442.30s -> 6448.22s]  So how much electricity have I wasted so far?
[6448.22s -> 6449.50s]  Let's take a look at my finances.
[6457.05s -> 6457.85s]  Are you kidding me?
[6458.49s -> 6461.93s]  $260,000.
[6464.88s -> 6469.76s]  At least I got a deductible of $7,700 this year in taxes.
[6472.00s -> 6472.88s]  What is...
[6472.88s -> 6474.80s]  The beavers are that expensive?
[6479.61s -> 6482.09s]  That's how much 10 beavers cost?
[6483.18s -> 6483.98s]  That's not true.
[6484.62s -> 6488.60s]  A beaver is like probably $60.
[6489.72s -> 6496.43s]  They had to be imported from America because this is Europe.
[6500.25s -> 6502.01s]  It was the dinosaurs.
[6507.47s -> 6507.71s]  All right.
[6507.71s -> 6508.75s]  Well, that's a wash though.
[6508.75s -> 6509.71s]  This month doesn't count.
[6513.93s -> 6514.17s]  Okay.
[6514.17s -> 6518.01s]  Honestly, that's more confusing than if it was beavers because
[6518.81s -> 6521.53s]  a T-Rex is definitely worth more than probably $50 million.
[6522.49s -> 6524.06s]  How much was a T-Rex?
[6524.06s -> 6524.78s]  10 grand?
[6524.78s -> 6525.34s]  20 grand?
[6526.14s -> 6528.30s]  No, don't...
[6528.30s -> 6528.78s]  You can't...
[6528.78s -> 6529.42s]  You can't fire.
[6531.31s -> 6532.11s]  No, don't fire.
[6532.67s -> 6533.15s]  All right.
[6533.15s -> 6533.55s]  We need...
[6534.27s -> 6535.95s]  I need some kiosks here.
[6537.13s -> 6539.37s]  We need ATM.
[6539.37s -> 6541.05s]  Yeah, we want to clean them out.
[6549.13s -> 6550.65s]  Right behind that is the donation machine.
[6551.21s -> 6554.35s]  Where's the donation machine?
[6558.24s -> 6561.36s]  Yeah, you take out money from the ATM and you go directly
[6561.36s -> 6563.20s]  to the fucking donation machine behind you.
[6566.97s -> 6567.93s]  Where is it?
[6567.93s -> 6570.88s]  That's an educator podium.
[6571.52s -> 6576.04s]  Family restroom ATM.
[6576.68s -> 6579.26s]  Is the zoo open yet?
[6579.26s -> 6579.42s]  No.
[6583.61s -> 6584.49s]  Research lab.
[6585.05s -> 6589.90s]  Am I missing something here?
[6594.81s -> 6595.93s]  Wireless headsets?
[6596.73s -> 6602.04s]  Maybe it's over here.
[6606.59s -> 6607.23s]  Gift cart.
[6609.08s -> 6610.28s]  Wireless headsets.
[6611.24s -> 6612.44s]  Cave painting hall.
[6613.32s -> 6615.28s]  Oh, here it is.
[6615.28s -> 6615.52s]  Okay.
[6616.24s -> 6617.69s]  Donation box.
[6617.69s -> 6625.96s]  So let's spin this around over here and then do one over here as well.
[6626.92s -> 6635.32s]  Guys, if you like the show, you know, consider wiping out your checking account.
[6635.32s -> 6637.88s]  Does this cost money to use?
[6640.80s -> 6642.00s]  No, don't sell it.
[6642.00s -> 6643.77s]  Okay.
[6646.08s -> 6646.80s]  That's good.
[6646.80s -> 6647.12s]  Okay.
[6648.08s -> 6648.72s]  All right.
[6648.72s -> 6649.68s]  So I got money.
[6649.68s -> 6650.48s]  I need food.
[6652.67s -> 6653.31s]  Picnic table.
[6653.31s -> 6653.63s]  We'll put it...
[6653.63s -> 6654.83s]  We'll make a little spot over here.
[6655.47s -> 6661.93s]  Let's get some concrete, dirt, sand, brick, stone.
[6664.24s -> 6665.52s]  This would be like the food area.
[6665.52s -> 6666.96s]  This guy's dancing in the road.
[6670.64s -> 6673.12s]  He's just getting beeped at.
[6673.12s -> 6673.84s]  Get out of the way.
[6682.08s -> 6682.72s]  Hey, come on.
[6682.72s -> 6684.00s]  You got to make a living.
[6684.00s -> 6686.46s]  So stone path.
[6687.02s -> 6690.92s]  This is going to be the food court.
[6690.92s -> 6692.48s]  So we're going to go this way.
[6693.20s -> 6701.48s]  That's fine over there.
[6704.46s -> 6704.86s]  That's good.
[6704.86s -> 6707.82s]  So there's going to be food, drinks, right at the beginning.
[6707.82s -> 6708.86s]  Put a bathroom over here.
[6709.58s -> 6710.46s]  Oh, maybe we won't.
[6715.07s -> 6716.11s]  Elevated paths.
[6716.91s -> 6717.55s]  Okay.
[6717.55s -> 6718.03s]  Buildings.
[6719.96s -> 6721.40s]  So we need a...
[6721.40s -> 6723.56s]  I need an educator podium in front of the beavers.
[6724.20s -> 6725.08s]  That's going to be over here.
[6727.77s -> 6728.49s]  Really important.
[6729.13s -> 6730.01s]  This is all I have.
[6730.73s -> 6734.75s]  I need an educator.
[6735.47s -> 6739.66s]  I need some maintenance workers too.
[6740.30s -> 6742.00s]  A trainer.
[6742.72s -> 6746.52s]  We can teach them tricks.
[6748.19s -> 6748.51s]  Cool.
[6748.51s -> 6748.75s]  Okay.
[6749.55s -> 6754.52s]  There's the educator podium for the beaver exhibit.
[6760.06s -> 6762.86s]  I'm just poisoning with the carbon.
[6763.82s -> 6765.34s]  No, they're far enough away.
[6765.34s -> 6766.14s]  Everything's going to be fine.
[6766.70s -> 6767.50s]  All right.
[6767.50s -> 6768.94s]  I'm almost ready to open my zoo.
[6770.30s -> 6770.86s]  Almost time.
[6774.19s -> 6775.39s]  Small restroom.
[6775.39s -> 6779.60s]  Staff center.
[6779.60s -> 6780.40s]  This is huge.
[6780.96s -> 6782.97s]  It's going up here.
[6782.97s -> 6787.94s]  Okay.
[6790.12s -> 6791.08s]  Name of the beavers.
[6792.59s -> 6793.47s]  Not yet.
[6793.47s -> 6795.66s]  I gotta build some more stuff though.
[6797.04s -> 6798.00s]  Okay, we need food.
[6798.80s -> 6799.28s]  What do we get?
[6800.00s -> 6800.56s]  I can't look at this.
[6800.56s -> 6801.68s]  I'm going to get hungry.
[6801.68s -> 6803.04s]  I really will get hungry looking at this.
[6804.08s -> 6806.00s]  A sub sandwich.
[6806.00s -> 6809.04s]  Subs are meat-filled sandwiches that are commonly devoured for lunch.
[6809.04s -> 6810.32s]  Why would you word it like that?
[6810.32s -> 6810.64s]  Weird.
[6811.60s -> 6814.75s]  Okay.
[6814.75s -> 6815.31s]  Sub shop.
[6816.03s -> 6817.23s]  Uh, sushi.
[6818.43s -> 6822.51s]  I need to put the sushi place in front of like an aquarium exhibit, don't I?
[6823.23s -> 6826.44s]  Well, that's really fun.
[6826.44s -> 6827.32s]  Why would I want to do that?
[6827.96s -> 6831.74s]  No, that's normal, right?
[6833.96s -> 6834.44s]  Salads.
[6838.20s -> 6838.60s]  Coffee.
[6840.72s -> 6844.91s]  And water.
[6844.91s -> 6846.19s]  Make sure water is...
[6846.19s -> 6847.07s]  We need water over here.
[6847.95s -> 6851.53s]  Cotton candy.
[6851.53s -> 6852.41s]  Candy can cart.
[6852.41s -> 6852.89s]  No.
[6852.89s -> 6853.53s]  Soda drinks.
[6858.17s -> 6859.05s]  And hot dogs.
[6862.00s -> 6862.32s]  All right.
[6864.00s -> 6880.11s]  I think I'm almost ready to open the park.
[6880.67s -> 6884.43s]  I'm ready.
[6884.43s -> 6885.07s]  No, not yet.
[6885.79s -> 6888.03s]  These are luxurious food stands.
[6888.03s -> 6889.15s]  Yeah, you're going to be paying for quality.
[6889.79s -> 6891.58s]  It's not shitty quality.
[6893.40s -> 6894.76s]  Going to staff center for supplies.
[6894.76s -> 6896.04s]  Okay, I think I have the staff center.
[6896.04s -> 6897.96s]  All right, I need one more exhibit before I open the zoo.
[6898.68s -> 6902.12s]  And it's going to be something that I can handle it.
[6902.12s -> 6905.21s]  How about one beluga?
[6906.24s -> 6906.88s]  No.
[6906.88s -> 6907.68s]  A whale.
[6907.68s -> 6908.48s]  A huge whale.
[6911.64s -> 6912.52s]  Orca.
[6912.52s -> 6915.72s]  A giant warthog.
[6921.12s -> 6921.68s]  I don't know.
[6922.24s -> 6924.36s]  Should I make a beluga whale?
[6925.00s -> 6933.24s]  What the hell?
[6933.32s -> 6934.12s]  Cave lion.
[6935.08s -> 6936.20s]  Komodo dragon.
[6939.36s -> 6942.06s]  Gigantopithecus.
[6944.14s -> 6944.38s]  What?
[6952.46s -> 6952.94s]  What about...
[6953.50s -> 6959.36s]  I mean, I kind of want to do the gigantopithecus.
[6960.00s -> 6966.52s]  This thing...
[6966.52s -> 6967.56s]  This is huge.
[6967.56s -> 6968.36s]  60 grand.
[6968.36s -> 6968.76s]  All right.
[6968.76s -> 6969.72s]  What biome does it need?
[6970.76s -> 6971.88s]  Tropical rainforest.
[6972.52s -> 6976.09s]  So let's do...
[6976.09s -> 6977.77s]  Let's get the area secure.
[6978.41s -> 6981.24s]  Okay.
[6981.24s -> 6987.24s]  What does he eat?
[6987.96s -> 6999.71s]  Okay.
[6999.71s -> 7006.83s]  He needs a better habitat.
[7007.79s -> 7008.75s]  He needs a habitat.
[7010.17s -> 7011.53s]  He eats beavers.
[7011.53s -> 7012.09s]  What do you eat?
[7012.73s -> 7013.77s]  He's extinct.
[7013.77s -> 7014.41s]  He's...
[7014.41s -> 7015.05s]  I'm bringing it...
[7015.05s -> 7016.17s]  Look, I'm bringing him back.
[7018.84s -> 7019.48s]  No, he eats...
[7020.44s -> 7020.92s]  Lurbo.
[7022.72s -> 7023.52s]  Dinosaur meat.
[7026.59s -> 7026.91s]  Shrimp.
[7029.04s -> 7030.32s]  He's got a lot of options here.
[7031.84s -> 7032.80s]  Hollow log with...
[7032.80s -> 7034.96s]  Look, I'm just getting one of those dog toys
[7034.96s -> 7036.24s]  and filling it with different foods.
[7036.24s -> 7037.20s]  And peanut butter and stuff.
[7039.88s -> 7040.84s]  He's...
[7040.84s -> 7042.20s]  It's really hard for him to do.
[7042.20s -> 7043.56s]  And he's sticking his tongue in there like,
[7043.56s -> 7044.28s]  I can't get it.
[7047.71s -> 7048.19s]  All right.
[7048.19s -> 7049.47s]  So he eats fish.
[7050.03s -> 7055.18s]  Let's go ahead and get him in there.
[7056.19s -> 7059.58s]  Pause the game though.
[7059.58s -> 7060.30s]  Holy shit.
[7060.86s -> 7061.42s]  He's huge.
[7062.49s -> 7062.81s]  All right.
[7062.81s -> 7067.10s]  So we need roots.
[7067.98s -> 7068.62s]  Food dish.
[7071.26s -> 7072.22s]  Bamboo.
[7072.22s -> 7072.94s]  Is this what you eat?
[7073.58s -> 7079.05s]  What happened to like the dinosaur head?
[7079.05s -> 7079.93s]  Squeaky toy.
[7090.72s -> 7091.04s]  Okay.
[7092.70s -> 7093.98s]  He's an artist.
[7096.59s -> 7097.63s]  A feeder ball.
[7097.63s -> 7098.11s]  Okay.
[7098.11s -> 7098.75s]  Feeder ball.
[7101.04s -> 7101.92s]  Squeaky toys.
[7106.70s -> 7107.26s]  Habitat.
[7107.98s -> 7108.78s]  Shade structure.
[7110.20s -> 7111.00s]  Rock shelter.
[7111.56s -> 7113.93s]  Or a lion top of...
[7115.21s -> 7116.41s]  This is big.
[7116.41s -> 7117.29s]  What about this?
[7117.29s -> 7118.17s]  Here we go.
[7118.17s -> 7127.56s]  I wish I could put it here.
[7137.79s -> 7139.39s]  Only let him have the easel?
[7139.39s -> 7140.83s]  Oh, this is what it's gonna have to do.
[7141.71s -> 7142.43s]  No, wait, hold on.
[7146.04s -> 7147.08s]  That's gonna have to do for now.
[7147.08s -> 7147.96s]  I can expand later.
[7150.46s -> 7151.26s]  Food.
[7151.26s -> 7152.86s]  We're gonna put branches over here.
[7153.66s -> 7156.24s]  We'll put some food dish.
[7161.15s -> 7163.63s]  Let's put some yummy leaves.
[7164.43s -> 7165.82s]  Okay.
[7166.46s -> 7169.98s]  Let's give him some little trees.
[7172.52s -> 7173.92s]  All right.
[7173.92s -> 7174.40s]  Looks good.
[7174.40s -> 7175.28s]  Let's give him a rock.
[7176.51s -> 7176.83s]  Oh!
[7177.47s -> 7177.71s]  Okay.
[7177.71s -> 7178.67s]  I thought I just killed him.
[7179.92s -> 7181.60s]  That scared the shit out of me for some reason.
[7181.60s -> 7181.84s]  All right.
[7182.40s -> 7186.28s]  Okay.
[7186.84s -> 7188.04s]  So now he needs a...
[7191.66s -> 7192.22s]  We need this...
[7193.02s -> 7193.90s]  What is it?
[7193.90s -> 7194.46s]  What does he need?
[7194.46s -> 7195.02s]  The tundra?
[7195.98s -> 7196.78s]  Family tree.
[7197.90s -> 7199.80s]  Wait, they're gonna have babies?
[7200.52s -> 7202.04s]  All right.
[7202.04s -> 7202.52s]  I need...
[7202.52s -> 7203.16s]  What does he need?
[7203.96s -> 7205.08s]  What biome?
[7205.08s -> 7209.56s]  I forget what the hell it was.
[7211.29s -> 7212.49s]  Or it was tropical rainforest.
[7212.49s -> 7213.37s]  There it is.
[7213.37s -> 7214.17s]  All right.
[7214.17s -> 7215.13s]  Let's go with this.
[7216.89s -> 7219.02s]  What the fuck?
[7219.82s -> 7232.44s]  Let's get...
[7232.44s -> 7233.88s]  I can put a few of these trees in here.
[7233.88s -> 7234.36s]  Just...
[7234.36s -> 7235.40s]  Actually, this is elevated now.
[7235.40s -> 7236.12s]  Let's go up here.
[7237.32s -> 7238.36s]  Actually, he should be happy.
[7239.00s -> 7239.72s]  I'd be happy.
[7240.60s -> 7242.97s]  Put him in like the golden seeds.
[7243.85s -> 7244.33s]  I think he...
[7244.33s -> 7244.73s]  Okay.
[7244.73s -> 7245.93s]  So let's see how that happens.
[7245.93s -> 7247.53s]  So let's get the exhibit out.
[7249.85s -> 7251.45s]  I need to put a entrance here.
[7254.51s -> 7254.99s]  Right here.
[7255.63s -> 7256.43s]  Actually, let's put it...
[7256.43s -> 7256.67s]  Yeah.
[7256.67s -> 7257.63s]  Right there.
[7258.59s -> 7260.46s]  All right.
[7260.46s -> 7265.26s]  I've got my first giganthosaurus.
[7265.82s -> 7271.39s]  I'm gonna think of a good name.
[7271.39s -> 7272.27s]  Is he ready to paint?
[7272.99s -> 7275.16s]  Who's a painter's name?
[7275.96s -> 7277.84s]  Michelangelo?
[7277.84s -> 7278.48s]  Picasso?
[7281.42s -> 7282.54s]  How about Bigasso?
[7283.18s -> 7285.34s]  Because he's big.
[7286.06s -> 7286.78s]  Bigasco.
[7287.34s -> 7299.02s]  Okay.
[7299.02s -> 7302.89s]  He's unable to reach the leaves.
[7302.89s -> 7304.41s]  Maybe too close to another object.
[7309.34s -> 7310.54s]  Beaver is pregnant?
[7311.50s -> 7312.30s]  Where?
[7312.30s -> 7314.24s]  Who's pregnant?
[7321.28s -> 7321.76s]  Oh, this is...
[7322.16s -> 7337.36s]  He's like, oh, wow.
[7337.36s -> 7338.56s]  I got a good view of that.
[7339.28s -> 7343.50s]  What are these?
[7344.22s -> 7345.42s]  What are these fishes?
[7345.42s -> 7346.38s]  Where did they come from?
[7346.38s -> 7347.74s]  Why are you so angry?
[7347.74s -> 7349.66s]  Going to pee.
[7354.76s -> 7357.00s]  You're not gonna go pee in somebody's food, are you?
[7357.00s -> 7365.53s]  What food bowl is he about to piss in?
[7366.17s -> 7379.00s]  Oh, there he goes.
[7379.00s -> 7379.96s]  Peeing on dirt.
[7380.52s -> 7381.98s]  Okay.
[7381.98s -> 7382.86s]  Good pee.
[7382.86s -> 7384.22s]  What the hell is this?
[7384.22s -> 7386.14s]  They made their own beaver lodge.
[7386.14s -> 7387.58s]  I didn't do this, did I?
[7387.58s -> 7388.22s]  Who's in there?
[7389.02s -> 7391.26s]  Resting in the beaver lodge.
[7391.26s -> 7392.22s]  They just made this.
[7392.94s -> 7400.25s]  I want to go in there.
[7400.25s -> 7413.44s]  Am I allowed in here?
[7413.44s -> 7420.41s]  American Beaver 3 is pregnant.
[7420.41s -> 7421.93s]  They're just having sex with each other in here.
[7422.49s -> 7424.56s]  This is...
[7424.56s -> 7426.00s]  Okay, this is kind of like not good.
[7426.64s -> 7434.44s]  Replenish.
[7434.44s -> 7445.18s]  That's a VR game quality.
[7445.18s -> 7445.82s]  All right, we're good.
[7449.82s -> 7450.14s]  Yep.
[7450.14s -> 7453.44s]  These two just create...
[7454.00s -> 7455.76s]  They're creating babies over here.
[7456.40s -> 7457.68s]  I'm going to have to keep expanding this.
[7457.68s -> 7458.96s]  They're just going to keep having sex with each other.
[7460.24s -> 7461.76s]  And they're going to keep having babies.
[7461.76s -> 7463.12s]  I'm going to have to keep expanding this.
[7463.12s -> 7470.11s]  The bark isn't even open yet.
[7470.11s -> 7471.23s]  Well, how's my other guy doing?
[7477.10s -> 7478.30s]  I was like, why is he not here?
[7479.50s -> 7480.30s]  Going to pee.
[7484.32s -> 7485.20s]  Squeaky toy.
[7485.92s -> 7487.20s]  Where's he going to pee?
[7487.20s -> 7489.28s]  He's going to piss on the easel and make art.
[7489.84s -> 7492.08s]  Let's visit him.
[7498.09s -> 7498.81s]  Whoa, easy.
[7499.37s -> 7502.12s]  I want to groom him.
[7502.12s -> 7502.84s]  How do I groom him?
[7503.48s -> 7507.04s]  He's getting antsy.
[7507.04s -> 7507.68s]  I don't like this.
[7511.66s -> 7512.62s]  No, he's happy.
[7514.80s -> 7515.68s]  Look how happy.
[7515.68s -> 7516.00s]  50!
[7516.00s -> 7517.52s]  Look, he's like, I can lift so much weight.
[7520.09s -> 7520.81s]  All right, well, you're good.
[7521.53s -> 7523.92s]  Currently sitting.
[7527.15s -> 7527.79s]  Draw something.
[7527.79s -> 7528.91s]  All right, I need to...
[7528.91s -> 7530.11s]  It's time to open the park.
[7530.19s -> 7532.11s]  Wait, I need an education stand and a donation machine.
[7543.26s -> 7544.94s]  Educator platform can go here.
[7550.01s -> 7551.13s]  We need another educator.
[7556.62s -> 7559.34s]  And I need some donation machines as well.
[7559.98s -> 7563.53s]  Donation box.
[7563.53s -> 7564.09s]  Go ahead.
[7568.00s -> 7568.64s]  Right in front.
[7569.20s -> 7572.11s]  I think it's time to actually open this place.
[7574.17s -> 7574.89s]  I'm going to save it.
[7576.11s -> 7577.15s]  Another beaver is pregnant.
[7581.26s -> 7581.90s]  Save game.
[7592.08s -> 7593.28s]  All right, beavers and big guys.
[7600.32s -> 7602.46s]  All right, it's time to open the park.
[7603.02s -> 7603.90s]  Wait, I need a toilet.
[7604.46s -> 7606.44s]  I need a bathroom.
[7606.44s -> 7607.32s]  It's really important.
[7610.91s -> 7614.27s]  Uh, let's do family restroom.
[7614.27s -> 7617.96s]  This is huge.
[7617.96s -> 7630.49s]  All right, good enough.
[7630.49s -> 7634.25s]  It's a couple's restroom?
[7634.25s -> 7634.57s]  What?
[7635.21s -> 7638.19s]  All right, what's wrong with the leaves?
[7638.83s -> 7647.69s]  You apparently can't reach these leaves because they're too high.
[7647.69s -> 7647.93s]  Okay.
[7648.57s -> 7652.16s]  Well, then let's make that terrain better then.
[7652.72s -> 7664.14s]  I need to lower the ground.
[7664.70s -> 7668.44s]  I may have just fucked it all up.
[7668.44s -> 7669.00s]  Whatever.
[7669.00s -> 7669.64s]  Open the park.
[7672.78s -> 7674.62s]  The park is now officially...
[7694.65s -> 7695.21s]  Let's go!
[7695.21s -> 7696.25s]  Rack in the money.
[7696.25s -> 7707.12s]  I can't wait to see some animals.
[7707.20s -> 7708.40s]  Beaver and butt head.
[7714.16s -> 7714.96s]  One person.
[7716.33s -> 7719.21s]  After months and months in development.
[7719.21s -> 7721.71s]  One, one guy.
[7722.27s -> 7726.22s]  Well, I hope you enjoy yourself.
[7726.22s -> 7727.26s]  Get to work.
[7727.26s -> 7730.09s]  The first guess, you've been training for so long.
[7732.00s -> 7734.16s]  For this exact moment right here.
[7734.16s -> 7736.00s]  And you're missing your opportunity.
[7736.00s -> 7740.32s]  Where's it going?
[7740.32s -> 7741.36s]  We're going to follow this guy around.
[7745.15s -> 7745.79s]  No ATM.
[7745.79s -> 7746.67s]  Skip the ATM.
[7748.08s -> 7749.76s]  Skipping the donation machine.
[7753.48s -> 7753.88s]  Okay.
[7758.84s -> 7762.20s]  I think this person is so dehydrated and foodless at this point.
[7764.09s -> 7768.65s]  Ooh, I like seeing animal American beaver 13 eat from the substrate pile.
[7771.21s -> 7774.25s]  It's neat seeing American beaver 2 resting in the beaver lodge.
[7775.21s -> 7777.13s]  I can't wait to see some more animals.
[7777.13s -> 7777.77s]  Wait, track him.
[7783.53s -> 7784.09s]  He likes it.
[7788.32s -> 7789.28s]  Kimmy is high.
[7790.24s -> 7791.12s]  Well, we got another guest.
[7793.18s -> 7797.10s]  See, this guy just tweeted out that he was here and how fun it was.
[7797.66s -> 7799.58s]  And his five followers just said it to come.
[7804.81s -> 7806.49s]  I can't wait to what people have to say about...
[7813.68s -> 7815.68s]  Is nobody going to get on that ride?
[7818.64s -> 7819.60s]  I want someone to get...
[7819.60s -> 7821.12s]  How do I get them on the ride?
[7824.99s -> 7825.79s]  Is it possible?
[7829.07s -> 7830.03s]  At least they're happy.
[7830.03s -> 7831.07s]  I need like benches.
[7832.03s -> 7833.15s]  I need a place to sit down.
[7837.96s -> 7839.88s]  American beaver 4 is about to give birth.
[7840.52s -> 7845.55s]  Come on, come on, this is first time.
[7846.11s -> 7860.12s]  This is my first ever time that I'm going to...
[7860.84s -> 7876.36s]  I got it.
[7876.36s -> 7877.72s]  Oh, now there's not enough space.
[7878.52s -> 7879.24s]  I have...
[7879.24s -> 7880.20s]  There's not enough space.
[7885.64s -> 7886.76s]  More space.
[7888.91s -> 7891.71s]  Many animals don't have enough space because they're a beaver
[7891.71s -> 7894.27s]  and they're inside of this giant beaver enclosure.
[7895.07s -> 7895.87s]  Another birth.
[7895.87s -> 7897.39s]  Oh, god damn it.
[7897.39s -> 7901.50s]  I can stay on top of this.
[7901.50s -> 7913.68s]  What the fuck's going on here?
[7913.68s -> 7915.76s]  Here comes another one.
[7916.32s -> 7922.18s]  Okay.
[7922.88s -> 7929.42s]  Here comes the magic of birth.
[7950.46s -> 7951.26s]  More space.
[7952.06s -> 7958.89s]  No, the park is open.
[7958.89s -> 7960.33s]  The park is currently open.
[7960.33s -> 7960.83s]  Hold on.
[7967.12s -> 7968.08s]  Set them all free.
[7968.64s -> 7970.08s]  No, I'm not going to set them all free.
[7970.08s -> 7971.20s]  Free.
[7971.90s -> 7991.69s]  Now, no one can even walk in the park.
[7991.69s -> 7998.19s]  There needs to be a path that now leads up here
[7998.83s -> 7999.63s]  and then around...
[7999.63s -> 8000.99s]  I got to level this whole thing.
[8001.71s -> 8012.22s]  Hold on, let me...
[8012.22s -> 8020.06s]  I'm making sure that I'm going to future proof
[8022.54s -> 8024.14s]  this whole exhibit here.
[8029.02s -> 8029.74s]  Oh, fuck.
[8035.36s -> 8042.08s]  Uh, sorry about that, guys.
[8042.64s -> 8052.16s]  I'll fix this, don't worry.
[8052.80s -> 8060.60s]  Those guys just drove around in a circle until they were evaporated.
[8061.32s -> 8068.04s]  And now, this is going to come out all the way to here,
[8069.50s -> 8070.00s]  right there,
[8070.70s -> 8071.50s]  and then up here.
[8072.06s -> 8078.33s]  It's like this.
[8079.13s -> 8084.67s]  Look at how much more space this is going to be.
[8087.76s -> 8089.28s]  Down here, the path is going to go around
[8090.08s -> 8095.12s]  to make sure this doesn't happen for like another at least 30 minutes.
[8096.32s -> 8096.88s]  That's done.
[8099.87s -> 8104.57s]  No one even...
[8104.57s -> 8106.25s]  No, people are going to walk in this park
[8106.25s -> 8109.05s]  and say, well, the beaver exhibit is stupid, and they leave.
[8109.69s -> 8110.65s]  A little do they know
[8111.55s -> 8113.71s]  that I have an extinct animal up here
[8114.35s -> 8116.27s]  that is wildly intelligent.
[8116.27s -> 8117.39s]  He can paint paintings.
[8120.64s -> 8121.52s]  Sell some beavers.
[8121.52s -> 8122.02s]  I can't.
[8122.88s -> 8124.40s]  They just have to put them up for adoption.
[8125.12s -> 8126.24s]  See?
[8131.47s -> 8133.39s]  Big Osco has no water.
[8137.84s -> 8140.46s]  Well, I'll get to that in a second.
[8141.10s -> 8143.76s]  I'll get to that in just a second.
[8144.32s -> 8146.67s]  All right, we need not tropical rainforest.
[8146.67s -> 8152.70s]  We need wetlands.
[8152.70s -> 8153.82s]  Take the trees off.
[8153.82s -> 8155.50s]  Uh, I'm okay with a little bit of rocks.
[8162.96s -> 8166.27s]  Now, I can expand the water a little bit.
[8166.27s -> 8167.63s]  Actually, let's have a nice little, uh,
[8168.59s -> 8170.11s]  little spot for them to go like up here.
[8170.99s -> 8176.04s]  Yeah, so that looks good.
[8176.76s -> 8178.41s]  Maybe a little bit deeper.
[8179.77s -> 8182.24s]  Give them some more room.
[8185.40s -> 8185.90s]  All right.
[8186.60s -> 8187.10s]  Okay.
[8189.24s -> 8189.74s]  All right.
[8194.94s -> 8196.22s]  Now, there's no problem.
[8196.22s -> 8197.18s]  We just need to put a...
[8199.76s -> 8200.96s]  Put crocodiles in there.
[8204.16s -> 8204.80s]  What?
[8204.80s -> 8206.96s]  Will a crocodile eat a beaver
[8208.06s -> 8210.38s]  in the same amount of time it takes for a beaver to come out of
[8211.42s -> 8211.90s]  a conception?
[8211.90s -> 8212.30s]  You know what I mean?
[8212.30s -> 8214.22s]  Like, to be conceived.
[8214.22s -> 8216.62s]  To be birthed, born.
[8216.62s -> 8218.12s]  Is that going to be the same?
[8218.68s -> 8219.56s]  Probably not.
[8219.56s -> 8225.28s]  Okay, so let's get...
[8226.08s -> 8227.76s]  I need the entrance.
[8230.46s -> 8231.50s]  So, we need one here.
[8232.54s -> 8233.42s]  We need one up here.
[8235.23s -> 8235.95s]  All righty, let's go.
[8236.67s -> 8238.60s]  Oh, shit.
[8238.60s -> 8239.32s]  You have to be out here.
[8239.88s -> 8241.05s]  I need to move this.
[8241.69s -> 8245.61s]  You need to move this.
[8247.85s -> 8250.60s]  I need fucking a road.
[8254.09s -> 8255.13s]  Not contained.
[8255.13s -> 8256.73s]  How is American Beaver 4 not contained?
[8257.53s -> 8259.69s]  Yes, you are.
[8261.34s -> 8262.06s]  They're all happy.
[8264.04s -> 8265.64s]  They can't get to the ape.
[8265.64s -> 8266.14s]  Wait.
[8266.68s -> 8287.96s]  Now they can.
[8299.32s -> 8300.44s]  I need an elevated path.
[8301.16s -> 8305.40s]  I wonder if I can...
[8310.00s -> 8312.83s]  Okay, they can make it.
[8313.39s -> 8314.35s]  Just need to get rid of this.
[8320.00s -> 8322.00s]  It looks a little ugly, but I'll fix it later.
[8330.51s -> 8331.07s]  More birth.
[8332.11s -> 8335.36s]  I don't think I can possibly get up here.
[8336.40s -> 8337.52s]  I need to make an elevated path.
[8339.96s -> 8341.24s]  Stone elevated path.
[8341.24s -> 8342.92s]  Okay, so we're gonna go right here.
[8343.56s -> 8351.56s]  And then this is gonna ramp down.
[8351.56s -> 8353.16s]  This is gonna be down, yeah, like that.
[8354.04s -> 8356.01s]  And then that leads to here.
[8367.10s -> 8367.98s]  All right.
[8368.88s -> 8369.28s]  We're good.
[8370.70s -> 8371.66s]  They can make it up here.
[8375.45s -> 8376.33s]  Oh, you dummy.
[8378.52s -> 8381.48s]  I need to really get in there.
[8382.12s -> 8398.60s]  The park is still open, isn't it?
[8401.74s -> 8403.66s]  Just make the bridge go over the beavers.
[8403.66s -> 8404.94s]  I mean, I was thinking about that.
[8405.90s -> 8409.77s]  It's a pretty good idea.
[8414.32s -> 8417.24s]  Okay, that looks good.
[8418.04s -> 8418.91s]  It's probably good.
[8418.91s -> 8420.03s]  I mean, not good at all.
[8421.95s -> 8422.88s]  It's all right.
[8422.88s -> 8423.36s]  That looks...
[8423.36s -> 8423.76s]  Look at that.
[8423.76s -> 8424.24s]  That's fine.
[8424.96s -> 8428.57s]  I'm just gonna fix this one later.
[8428.57s -> 8432.12s]  How are we doing?
[8432.12s -> 8432.52s]  We got any...
[8434.24s -> 8435.92s]  I don't like this zoo.
[8435.92s -> 8437.04s]  It's time for me to go home.
[8437.60s -> 8460.03s]  I don't think he's...
[8460.03s -> 8461.15s]  I don't think he's aggressive.
[8461.15s -> 8462.27s]  He just thinks it's funny.
[8465.44s -> 8466.80s]  He's just laughing.
[8470.19s -> 8471.95s]  Whoa, no way.
[8471.95s -> 8472.19s]  What?
[8473.47s -> 8474.27s]  What are you doing?
[8475.37s -> 8477.05s]  No, you're fired.
[8477.05s -> 8489.12s]  All right.
[8489.12s -> 8490.64s]  Hey, how do I make you happy?
[8490.64s -> 8491.68s]  I need to give him water.
[8513.53s -> 8514.33s]  I can't.
[8514.33s -> 8515.21s]  Whatever.
[8515.21s -> 8516.65s]  I'm not even gonna say anything.
[8517.21s -> 8519.69s]  Look at this painting.
[8519.69s -> 8521.37s]  Oh, that looks like shit.
[8521.37s -> 8524.92s]  What happened to the kid?
[8527.26s -> 8528.86s]  Where'd the guest go?
[8541.15s -> 8543.77s]  All right.
[8543.77s -> 8544.73s]  I gotta get back to this.
[8546.38s -> 8547.26s]  Tied.
[8547.26s -> 8549.66s]  No, we just gave him a little tap on the face.
[8549.66s -> 8552.99s]  And look at me, racking in mad dough over here.
[8555.21s -> 8556.32s]  Angry.
[8556.32s -> 8558.24s]  I think coffee drink one is overpriced.
[8558.24s -> 8558.72s]  Oh, action.
[8567.95s -> 8568.91s]  Fucking shot him.
[8575.02s -> 8575.42s]  It's...
[8575.42s -> 8577.90s]  Oh, I really need to use the bathroom.
[8577.90s -> 8579.42s]  I'm upset at the lack of trash cans.
[8579.42s -> 8580.30s]  I hope hot...
[8580.30s -> 8581.82s]  I hope dog hot...
[8581.82s -> 8583.82s]  I hope hot dog food stand.
[8585.34s -> 8586.86s]  Guests would like a place to sit.
[8589.71s -> 8591.55s]  Hey, littering?
[8592.35s -> 8593.63s]  You're gonna litter at my park?
[8594.27s -> 8596.36s]  This area smells.
[8629.00s -> 8630.28s]  He's just like, that is funny.
[8633.47s -> 8634.83s]  People are screaming.
[8634.83s -> 8639.24s]  I want to get over there.
[8639.24s -> 8642.08s]  He hasn't done anything wrong.
[8649.79s -> 8653.48s]  He's just listening to what she's saying.
[8653.48s -> 8654.52s]  He's very entertained.
[8655.16s -> 8659.17s]  Uh-oh.
[8665.80s -> 8667.16s]  He doesn't like this person.
[8667.80s -> 8670.06s]  I don't know why.
[8670.06s -> 8679.58s]  He just wants to eat leaves.
[8680.22s -> 8684.28s]  I wonder...
[8684.28s -> 8686.03s]  All right, let's let her out of here.
[8686.59s -> 8700.44s]  Well, he really doesn't care at all.
[8700.44s -> 8701.88s]  Help.
[8701.88s -> 8705.61s]  Big Asko is chasing me.
[8705.61s -> 8708.09s]  Well, that's not real.
[8708.09s -> 8709.61s]  He's chasing me.
[8709.61s -> 8719.66s]  All right, you're fine.
[8723.10s -> 8724.86s]  It was a fake Yelp complaint.
[8731.48s -> 8732.76s]  He needs food.
[8732.76s -> 8734.65s]  He doesn't have any food left?
[8734.65s -> 8738.46s]  What's he doing?
[8738.46s -> 8746.20s]  What happened?
[8746.20s -> 8746.76s]  What's wrong with him?
[8746.76s -> 8747.48s]  What happened?
[8747.48s -> 8749.55s]  Oh, he's just sleeping.
[8749.55s -> 8750.36s]  Okay.
[8750.36s -> 8751.80s]  Uh, let's get some food in here for you.
[8752.44s -> 8756.59s]  How about like a bowl of leaves?
[8757.31s -> 8760.10s]  Here.
[8761.76s -> 8762.26s]  There.
[8763.66s -> 8764.62s]  Now you can eat.
[8764.62s -> 8765.66s]  And yet you've got water.
[8765.66s -> 8766.38s]  There's water here.
[8767.84s -> 8769.12s]  There's still water in there.
[8770.98s -> 8771.70s]  Yeah, he's fine.
[8771.70s -> 8772.42s]  What are you talking about?
[8776.10s -> 8778.34s]  So now this is how you get reviews.
[8778.34s -> 8779.94s]  This is how you get attention to your park.
[8781.71s -> 8783.55s]  Everybody's reading in the newspaper about
[8784.86s -> 8786.14s]  the guy that got pushed over
[8786.14s -> 8787.26s]  and the lady that was screaming.
[8787.26s -> 8789.26s]  And now everyone just needs to come see for themselves.
[8790.75s -> 8791.25s]  Marketing.
[8791.79s -> 8792.53s]  One-on-one.
[8792.99s -> 8799.20s]  All right, how about even with the, uh, beavers?
[8799.76s -> 8802.83s]  The beavers in attraction?
[8803.47s -> 8804.59s]  Yeah, people like the beavers.
[8805.23s -> 8807.94s]  Seems to be going pretty well.
[8811.79s -> 8813.47s]  Uh, how do I get rid of this fucking thing?
[8813.47s -> 8814.27s]  I'm not going to use it.
[8814.91s -> 8830.70s]  All right, what's the next attraction?
[8831.82s -> 8833.10s]  People need to be able to get up there first.
[8835.23s -> 8837.07s]  I guarantee I turn a profit this next month.
[8838.03s -> 8841.68s]  All right, the track is gone.
[8843.92s -> 8844.96s]  It's just an annoyance.
[8845.52s -> 8848.45s]  Let's get some benches.
[8849.41s -> 8852.03s]  So bench.
[8852.67s -> 8853.31s]  Just sit it.
[8854.51s -> 8858.91s]  We need to make these a little wider.
[8859.71s -> 8865.89s]  And the food court.
[8865.89s -> 8866.93s]  There's got to be some benches.
[8867.89s -> 8872.96s]  Why are you so angry about?
[8872.96s -> 8873.46s]  Relax.
[8875.59s -> 8877.75s]  I don't have a place to sit down and drink my tea.
[8878.63s -> 8879.83s]  Uh, I need trash bins.
[8880.63s -> 8888.28s]  All right.
[8889.04s -> 8890.80s]  Finally, people can throw their trash away.
[8890.80s -> 8892.48s]  It's been like two hours.
[8897.67s -> 8899.75s]  American beaver 13 is really thirsty.
[8899.75s -> 8901.59s]  American beaver 5 is unable to reach the hollow log.
[8910.53s -> 8911.41s]  Just drink water.
[8912.05s -> 8913.72s]  There's running water right here.
[8920.92s -> 8923.00s]  Just just drink water.
[8923.72s -> 8926.44s]  All right, I need to refill.
[8926.44s -> 8927.32s]  Now this is full.
[8927.96s -> 8931.16s]  Is there really one water dish?
[8931.16s -> 8938.18s]  Nobody needs it fulfilled.
[8939.14s -> 8940.34s]  This is the only one.
[8941.06s -> 8945.22s]  Everyone's drinking out of the same water dish.
[8945.86s -> 8948.96s]  Oh, for the love of God.
[8948.96s -> 8949.68s]  Okay, hold on.
[8953.09s -> 8953.81s]  I didn't know that.
[8954.45s -> 8956.13s]  I thought they just went underwater and just went.
[8961.68s -> 8962.48s]  He's gonna fill it.
[8962.48s -> 8963.68s]  I need like a bunch of these.
[8963.68s -> 8964.40s]  I need them over here.
[8970.98s -> 8973.48s]  Uh, food dish with water.
[8974.12s -> 8976.60s]  Put it next to the foods.
[8976.60s -> 8977.56s]  I don't have to go that far.
[8978.44s -> 8982.45s]  That looks good.
[8984.85s -> 8985.25s]  All right.
[8985.81s -> 8986.85s]  How we doing with money?
[8997.72s -> 9001.24s]  Whatever.
[9001.24s -> 9004.36s]  $175 for a tuna can with water in it.
[9004.36s -> 9008.68s]  Yeah, all they're doing guys is the zookeepers are going over here and
[9009.32s -> 9011.96s]  dumping the dish in there and just putting it over there.
[9014.36s -> 9016.12s]  That's $175 middleman.
[9016.76s -> 9023.38s]  All right, let's go see how he's doing.
[9024.34s -> 9025.38s]  Your needs are good.
[9027.09s -> 9027.89s]  Not that thirsty.
[9027.89s -> 9028.69s]  Everything's good to go.
[9029.57s -> 9037.41s]  All right, I think it's time to add onto the zoo.
[9038.13s -> 9042.45s]  The next thing is going to be a water exhibit over here.
[9043.17s -> 9046.28s]  After another, I need another bathroom.
[9046.28s -> 9052.47s]  Family restroom right here.
[9053.35s -> 9055.62s]  And then take a path up this way.
[9057.00s -> 9058.52s]  And this is our first water exhibit.
[9058.52s -> 9059.56s]  It's going to be right here.
[9059.56s -> 9062.36s]  It's going to be like five killer whales.
[9063.00s -> 9069.91s]  Let's see what we need.
[9069.91s -> 9071.03s]  What kind of habitat do you need?
[9076.88s -> 9078.16s]  Can perform in shows.
[9078.96s -> 9082.48s]  We should get a flavor bird exhibit.
[9083.20s -> 9085.44s]  No, that's not bad.
[9085.44s -> 9086.16s]  That's not a bad idea.
[9092.58s -> 9099.67s]  Just like a stegosaurus, manatee, mastodon.
[9100.47s -> 9105.81s]  I mean, that's kind of a flavor bird right there.
[9105.81s -> 9107.17s]  No, that's the real flavor bird.
[9111.54s -> 9112.74s]  I want a water exhibit though.
[9116.44s -> 9117.16s]  Whale shark.
[9117.80s -> 9120.08s]  That's the biggest shark in the world, right?
[9120.08s -> 9120.88s]  Yeah.
[9120.88s -> 9122.47s]  I want a whale shark exhibit.
[9123.03s -> 9133.67s]  Maybe some sort of water dinosaur.
[9134.23s -> 9137.00s]  Tyrannosaurus rex.
[9137.00s -> 9138.12s]  This is so huge.
[9140.31s -> 9141.59s]  I kind of need this though.
[9142.23s -> 9144.53s]  The t-rex is going to be over here.
[9144.53s -> 9144.85s]  Up.
[9144.85s -> 9146.13s]  You have to go all the way up to see him.
[9146.77s -> 9148.55s]  What a brilliant strategy that is.
[9155.28s -> 9156.56s]  I like that strategy a lot.
[9157.20s -> 9158.32s]  I became famous.
[9164.12s -> 9164.92s]  Did it.
[9164.92s -> 9166.80s]  All right.
[9166.80s -> 9167.36s]  We need to do.
[9167.36s -> 9170.00s]  I'm going to do like two t-rexes up here.
[9170.56s -> 9172.16s]  This whole entire area.
[9172.80s -> 9175.04s]  The whole viewing angle is going to be from right here.
[9175.04s -> 9177.12s]  We're going to have two t-rexes up here.
[9177.12s -> 9186.02s]  So you can either go up to the t-rex or right to the gosko.
[9186.58s -> 9191.40s]  So let's start with this down here.
[9191.40s -> 9197.00s]  Because it kind of needs to be like this.
[9197.72s -> 9199.08s]  Well, that didn't fucking do anything.
[9199.88s -> 9203.48s]  I think I'm going to have to go from here.
[9204.04s -> 9207.40s]  Hmm.
[9211.09s -> 9211.49s]  No.
[9211.49s -> 9212.05s]  Not quite.
[9212.85s -> 9218.37s]  What about the manatee exhibit?
[9218.37s -> 9219.17s]  No, don't worry.
[9219.17s -> 9219.65s]  I'll get it.
[9220.53s -> 9226.72s]  Really.
[9226.72s -> 9227.84s]  How do I level this whole thing?
[9228.56s -> 9230.60s]  Can I like level this place?
[9230.60s -> 9231.72s]  Just fucking trash it.
[9232.44s -> 9235.46s]  Just make it flat.
[9240.28s -> 9240.92s]  Guest mode.
[9240.92s -> 9241.48s]  Terrain.
[9242.36s -> 9242.84s]  Editor.
[9242.84s -> 9243.24s]  Here we go.
[9244.36s -> 9245.56s]  Flattened terrain.
[9245.56s -> 9245.96s]  There it is.
[9247.48s -> 9260.36s]  I mean, I kind of fucked this.
[9260.36s -> 9261.48s]  I don't even need this bridge.
[9262.44s -> 9265.28s]  This bridge makes no sense.
[9265.28s -> 9265.52s]  No.
[9266.16s -> 9279.32s]  Kill that person for no reason.
[9279.32s -> 9279.56s]  Okay.
[9279.56s -> 9279.88s]  Here we go.
[9281.68s -> 9282.40s]  Flattened terrain.
[9285.33s -> 9285.81s]  Flatten it.
[9286.53s -> 9301.49s]  You dick.
[9302.21s -> 9305.48s]  How did I?
[9305.48s -> 9307.08s]  I'm trying to flatten the terrain.
[9307.08s -> 9309.96s]  I'll just have to go like this.
[9322.66s -> 9323.46s]  Oh.
[9323.46s -> 9327.17s]  Oh, fuck.
[9327.17s -> 9328.29s]  What have I done?
[9328.29s -> 9345.51s]  That's good.
[9345.51s -> 9351.24s]  Now I got to go back to here.
[9351.24s -> 9353.08s]  Where does this come out from?
[9353.08s -> 9356.68s]  No, this is not going to go up.
[9356.68s -> 9358.36s]  This has to go straight across.
[9359.48s -> 9370.92s]  And then down into right like here.
[9371.72s -> 9380.26s]  How much higher do you have to go?
[9408.84s -> 9409.40s]  No.
[9409.40s -> 9410.84s]  This is not what I wanted.
[9410.84s -> 9416.31s]  I'm going to go from here.
[9416.31s -> 9417.56s]  That makes most sense.
[9423.94s -> 9424.90s]  Beaver's pregnant.
[9425.54s -> 9426.26s]  All right.
[9426.26s -> 9429.76s]  That's good.
[9429.76s -> 9441.43s]  Are you telling me I can't go forward from here?
[9446.98s -> 9450.96s]  That is so close that it's infuriating me.
[9450.96s -> 9452.24s]  How is that possible?
[9452.24s -> 9492.29s]  I got a better idea.
[9492.29s -> 9493.65s]  Smooth this whole damn thing out.
[9495.25s -> 9502.20s]  So now I can just go straight down.
[9502.84s -> 9503.24s]  Right here.
[9503.88s -> 9507.25s]  Cross the earth onto your fist.
[9509.91s -> 9511.36s]  All right.
[9511.36s -> 9512.64s]  Can we do this again?
[9513.20s -> 9515.38s]  Guests need bathrooms.
[9515.38s -> 9517.46s]  Well, I'm trying to make a T-Rex exhibit.
[9517.46s -> 9520.02s]  So you're going to have to wait.
[9520.02s -> 9566.24s]  Here we go.
[9566.24s -> 9566.72s]  Got it.
[9566.72s -> 9567.28s]  All right.
[9567.28s -> 9571.46s]  Now we just need a regular path.
[9571.46s -> 9580.56s]  Let's get some more viewing angle for the beavers until it splits.
[9581.84s -> 9583.20s]  Which is going to split this way.
[9583.92s -> 9587.70s]  Fuck you, game.
[9588.34s -> 9592.15s]  How do I get rid of you?
[9592.15s -> 9593.19s]  I can't get rid of you.
[9593.91s -> 9598.56s]  I try to flatten you and it don't work.
[9599.20s -> 9605.80s]  Flatten.
[9605.80s -> 9611.24s]  Why is that one piece just sitting there?
[9611.96s -> 9615.08s]  Why are you doing this to me?
[9625.46s -> 9629.35s]  Dear Lord.
[9630.23s -> 9631.48s]  Oh, God.
[9631.48s -> 9632.36s]  Just keep it there.
[9632.36s -> 9633.16s]  Who cares?
[9633.80s -> 9640.39s]  Oh, no, no, no.
[9640.39s -> 9641.59s]  Now they're going to get out.
[9641.59s -> 9643.89s]  Look, you thought about it.
[9645.59s -> 9645.91s]  Okay.
[9647.22s -> 9649.22s]  So now we have this entrance this way.
[9649.22s -> 9653.25s]  This goes up to the, uh, vagasco.
[9653.25s -> 9655.41s]  Now it's time to make the T-Rex inhabitant.
[9657.80s -> 9659.24s]  Inhabit, uh, yeah.
[9659.24s -> 9659.80s]  Okay.
[9659.80s -> 9662.47s]  This needs a path.
[9663.51s -> 9664.90s]  Can I walk up this?
[9665.62s -> 9666.82s]  Okay.
[9666.82s -> 9667.30s]  It works.
[9670.79s -> 9673.35s]  Good.
[9673.35s -> 9674.07s]  Bath.
[9674.15s -> 9678.68s]  The path that needs to go.
[9681.20s -> 9681.99s]  The hell?
[9681.99s -> 9682.71s]  Why is it green?
[9683.35s -> 9684.68s]  Why did I just lose it?
[9684.68s -> 9685.64s]  I just lost a star.
[9686.52s -> 9688.12s]  I just lost a star.
[9688.12s -> 9688.52s]  For what?
[9689.16s -> 9691.86s]  Why did I lose it?
[9691.86s -> 9694.34s]  You can't lose accolades.
[9696.80s -> 9698.64s]  That's absolute dog shit.
[9698.64s -> 9698.88s]  All right.
[9698.88s -> 9699.20s]  Hold on.
[9700.68s -> 9703.62s]  I guess they need more bathrooms, huh?
[9703.62s -> 9703.94s]  Sure.
[9703.94s -> 9704.98s]  I'll make you more bathrooms.
[9706.02s -> 9715.06s]  Is this what you want?
[9715.06s -> 9720.58s]  How many more do you need?
[9724.32s -> 9725.28s]  What's that?
[9725.28s -> 9726.58s]  What are you guys doing over here?
[9727.22s -> 9730.37s]  Are people going and pissing in the bushes or like shitting in the woods?
[9731.01s -> 9733.89s]  Something is blocking the restroom.
[9738.76s -> 9739.40s]  What is blocking?
[9739.40s -> 9740.44s]  What's blocking the restroom?
[9749.12s -> 9749.36s]  All right.
[9749.36s -> 9750.08s]  The beavers are fine.
[9750.80s -> 9751.68s]  Everyone's doing well.
[9754.52s -> 9756.84s]  Guess it needs more bathrooms.
[9756.84s -> 9759.38s]  Well, you're gonna have to settle for what's there for now.
[9760.18s -> 9761.19s]  All right.
[9761.19s -> 9761.75s]  We need...
[9762.55s -> 9782.92s]  This is huge.
[9782.92s -> 9784.20s]  Ah, that sucks.
[9784.20s -> 9784.76s]  Wait a second.
[9786.28s -> 9792.60s]  Have I tried pressing G?
[9793.72s -> 9802.32s]  This terrain is so fucked up.
[9807.83s -> 9808.63s]  Got water?
[9808.63s -> 9809.27s]  Yeah.
[9809.27s -> 9810.15s]  No, you're fine.
[9810.87s -> 9812.20s]  Everybody's fine.
[9812.84s -> 9820.61s]  All right.
[9820.61s -> 9821.49s]  What does the T-Rex need?
[9824.07s -> 9829.36s]  T-Rex needs a tropical rainforest biome.
[9829.36s -> 9841.67s]  So tropical rainforest.
[9841.67s -> 9850.32s]  Trees in here.
[9851.20s -> 9852.47s]  That looks pretty nice.
[9855.20s -> 9859.08s]  And a little shallow water right in the corner.
[9859.64s -> 9861.08s]  A little pool.
[9863.44s -> 9865.36s]  American beaver six is pregnant again.
[9868.24s -> 9870.56s]  They're just having non-stop children in here.
[9871.36s -> 9873.06s]  This is the...
[9873.06s -> 9874.58s]  How can I tell how much money this has made?
[9875.14s -> 9876.98s]  Is there a way for me to tell?
[9877.70s -> 9879.83s]  How much money has the beaver attracted?
[9879.83s -> 9881.11s]  Was there even a donation machine here?
[9881.67s -> 9887.12s]  Has this just been for free the whole fucking time?
[9887.84s -> 9894.79s]  It has been.
[9895.43s -> 9897.28s]  This has been free the entire time.
[9901.64s -> 9902.44s]  Unless I get that...
[9903.08s -> 9904.12s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[9904.12s -> 9904.60s]  Never mind.
[9904.60s -> 9905.96s]  We're doing just fine.
[9905.96s -> 9906.92s]  We're doing just fine.
[9910.18s -> 9913.94s]  American beaver has received 2,165.
[9914.58s -> 9920.60s]  Let's flatten this out.
[9920.60s -> 9921.48s]  Make it look a little better.
[9925.64s -> 9927.00s]  Make a large viewing angle.
[9930.20s -> 9930.84s]  Delete that.
[9931.97s -> 9932.61s]  See like that.
[9932.61s -> 9934.05s]  Okay, so there's a lot of people that can be up here.
[9934.05s -> 9938.07s]  We need somebody to give tips on the T-Rex.
[9938.71s -> 9941.89s]  So we need a education kiosk.
[9941.89s -> 9945.22s]  Just did it right here.
[9946.10s -> 9953.11s]  Right here is fine, I think.
[9953.75s -> 9954.95s]  Let's get an educator.
[9959.17s -> 9960.85s]  And a donation box.
[9961.65s -> 9964.04s]  Because this is going to be worth...
[9964.04s -> 9965.64s]  This is going to be a lot of money.
[9968.10s -> 9969.38s]  So pay up.
[9971.04s -> 9971.52s]  Seriously.
[9974.92s -> 9975.48s]  All right.
[9975.48s -> 9982.02s]  So this is the walk up to the T-Rex exhibit.
[9982.82s -> 9983.54s]  Road splits.
[9984.42s -> 9986.20s]  Here's the person to tell you all about T-Rex.
[9986.20s -> 9987.24s]  Here's the donation machine.
[9987.96s -> 9991.27s]  So now I'm going to make sure there's like food in there.
[9991.27s -> 9991.91s]  All right, I can do that.
[9991.91s -> 9992.63s]  Okay.
[9995.94s -> 9997.62s]  $80,000 for a T-Rex.
[10000.79s -> 10001.43s]  All right.
[10001.43s -> 10003.51s]  Carnivorous predatory dinosaur.
[10003.51s -> 10003.99s]  What do they eat?
[10004.55s -> 10007.22s]  What does a T-Rex eat?
[10009.91s -> 10012.55s]  Male and female.
[10012.55s -> 10016.64s]  Okay.
[10016.64s -> 10019.12s]  T-Rex eats meat.
[10020.55s -> 10021.99s]  Right, makes sense.
[10021.99s -> 10033.04s]  Something is blocking the meat.
[10035.35s -> 10036.55s]  Nothing is blocking the meat.
[10037.27s -> 10041.14s]  Do they need more space?
[10042.02s -> 10044.26s]  They can eat, right?
[10044.82s -> 10052.90s]  There we go, yeah.
[10052.90s -> 10054.26s]  See, now let's get some water in there.
[10054.98s -> 10058.82s]  Get some toys.
[10060.37s -> 10061.33s]  Live food.
[10061.89s -> 10069.43s]  Okay.
[10070.32s -> 10071.36s]  Live lizards.
[10071.92s -> 10074.20s]  A block of ice.
[10075.65s -> 10076.21s]  A spring.
[10076.85s -> 10079.00s]  It needs to be a little bigger, but that's okay.
[10080.04s -> 10082.60s]  Dinosaur prey dummy?
[10082.60s -> 10084.56s]  Oh, that's going to be quite the show.
[10084.56s -> 10085.28s]  Put it right in front.
[10092.16s -> 10093.44s]  I'm blocking the pepperoni.
[10094.00s -> 10098.44s]  Look at how famous I am.
[10098.60s -> 10101.91s]  American Beaver wants to reproduce, but can't find a mate.
[10102.55s -> 10103.27s]  That's sad.
[10103.99s -> 10104.95s]  What are you two doing?
[10104.95s -> 10111.04s]  It's, I can't reach the food trough.
[10111.04s -> 10111.68s]  How?
[10111.68s -> 10112.40s]  It's right here.
[10113.20s -> 10114.24s]  Oh, this is probably in the way.
[10115.04s -> 10116.08s]  Are they going to start fighting?
[10122.29s -> 10122.77s]  Okay.
[10138.00s -> 10143.44s]  I put them both in this thing to have dinosaur sex and have dinosaur babies.
[10151.94s -> 10155.62s]  All right, well, 100, uh, I got 100, 100 guests have visited Yuzu.
[10155.62s -> 10156.26s]  That's good.
[10156.26s -> 10156.74s]  Cool.
[10157.38s -> 10159.76s]  How much am I going to get for this?
[10160.48s -> 10162.26s]  $860.
[10162.26s -> 10162.82s]  Thanks.
[10165.16s -> 10166.36s]  Is this, are you injured?
[10171.72s -> 10172.68s]  Social needs.
[10174.82s -> 10176.74s]  My, oh, my poor social needs.
[10177.38s -> 10178.10s]  I wonder.
[10185.09s -> 10190.88s]  Oh no, what have I done?
[10191.68s -> 10195.46s]  I killed the only friend I had.
[10196.18s -> 10197.70s]  He just broke out of the exhibit.
[10201.20s -> 10202.16s]  Well, he ain't going anywhere.
[10203.78s -> 10204.18s]  Okay.
[10204.18s -> 10205.30s]  Well, my social needs.
[10205.30s -> 10209.78s]  Who does it, how come he's not going anywhere?
[10210.50s -> 10212.26s]  Who does a T-Rex have a friend with?
[10219.65s -> 10220.77s]  Who can be a friend with?
[10222.31s -> 10222.95s]  What?
[10222.95s -> 10226.13s]  See, they all want to come up here now.
[10230.50s -> 10230.98s]  Beavers.
[10231.54s -> 10232.90s]  I can't put a beaver in here.
[10240.15s -> 10241.19s]  Get more space.
[10241.91s -> 10248.08s]  How am I going to get more space?
[10248.80s -> 10251.33s]  I need to go like this.
[10253.19s -> 10255.03s]  The keeper can't reach the T-Rex.
[10255.03s -> 10257.46s]  Oh, cause there's no gate on it.
[10257.46s -> 10257.70s]  Right.
[10258.42s -> 10259.22s]  I'm sorry about that.
[10260.60s -> 10262.20s]  Now you can reach the T-Rex.
[10262.92s -> 10267.12s]  I need to expand a little bit.
[10267.84s -> 10270.05s]  Let's get like a broken leg.
[10271.56s -> 10271.80s]  What?
[10271.80s -> 10272.92s]  I just saw like the, oh nevermind.
[10272.92s -> 10273.16s]  Okay.
[10274.50s -> 10277.94s]  So let's, uh, fix this.
[10280.50s -> 10285.41s]  And then I need the terrain tool.
[10286.13s -> 10288.05s]  And let's go like this.
[10305.36s -> 10305.92s]  There.
[10305.92s -> 10307.04s]  Now there's enough room for you.
[10307.76s -> 10319.51s]  Let's get you fenced back in.
[10320.55s -> 10329.54s]  Okay.
[10329.54s -> 10332.52s]  Non-contained.
[10332.52s -> 10333.16s]  Yes, you are.
[10333.16s -> 10333.88s]  That's good.
[10333.88s -> 10336.92s]  Let's get the actual terrain sprayer.
[10336.92s -> 10338.04s]  Tropical rainforest.
[10340.90s -> 10341.62s]  Oh, fuck.
[10341.62s -> 10342.10s]  Whatever.
[10343.06s -> 10347.27s]  Okay.
[10347.27s -> 10348.23s]  Now you should be happy.
[10348.79s -> 10355.01s]  This person got lost.
[10356.82s -> 10357.14s]  All right.
[10359.24s -> 10361.48s]  Can't reach the, oh, the dinosaur shit.
[10361.48s -> 10361.88s]  I'll get it.
[10372.95s -> 10373.91s]  I can go right here.
[10379.14s -> 10379.86s]  See?
[10379.86s -> 10382.34s]  He gets to scream at everybody from across the park.
[10382.98s -> 10384.55s]  You know how crazy that would be?
[10387.27s -> 10387.59s]  Okay.
[10387.59s -> 10388.47s]  I'll get it.
[10388.47s -> 10391.89s]  What does he need?
[10392.53s -> 10396.16s]  Well, I gotta pick up dinosaur poop.
[10399.56s -> 10400.20s]  All right.
[10400.20s -> 10402.04s]  Uh, let's wash his body.
[10402.60s -> 10404.96s]  I feel like this would be very unsafe.
[10405.60s -> 10407.76s]  All right.
[10407.76s -> 10408.24s]  He's good.
[10408.24s -> 10409.44s]  Just got some more water.
[10412.26s -> 10412.66s]  Okay.
[10412.66s -> 10413.06s]  We're good.
[10417.03s -> 10417.75s]  I can't leave.
[10417.75s -> 10418.71s]  I need to move this.
[10418.71s -> 10420.15s]  That's why the keeper can't reach him.
[10420.79s -> 10426.23s]  This has to go on the other side.
[10426.79s -> 10432.05s]  This guy's not talking to anyone.
[10432.77s -> 10434.23s]  All right.
[10434.23s -> 10435.27s]  We need to get some attraction up here.
[10435.27s -> 10436.71s]  We need to get some people up here.
[10436.71s -> 10436.95s]  You.
[10437.83s -> 10438.07s]  Help.
[10438.07s -> 10439.99s]  The Tyrus T-Rex is chasing me.
[10440.63s -> 10443.16s]  This zoo is great.
[10443.16s -> 10444.52s]  Well, that feels better.
[10444.52s -> 10449.68s]  So I got the T-Rex exhibit up here.
[10450.32s -> 10451.89s]  He oversees the whole park.
[10452.45s -> 10455.48s]  Fix the hole.
[10455.48s -> 10465.88s]  I'm almost at two stars.
[10466.52s -> 10467.24s]  Getting closer.
[10467.88s -> 10470.48s]  All right.
[10470.48s -> 10471.04s]  You're good.
[10473.72s -> 10473.96s]  All right.
[10473.96s -> 10477.00s]  We got already have more money than the American Beaver exhibit.
[10481.41s -> 10483.01s]  Which there needs to be.
[10483.01s -> 10483.65s]  What was wrong?
[10484.29s -> 10484.77s]  More birth.
[10484.77s -> 10485.97s]  How many Beavers do I have?
[10486.69s -> 10489.75s]  Is there a way I can tell how many Beavers I have?
[10490.87s -> 10491.43s]  16.
[10492.63s -> 10493.67s]  Where's the family tree?
[10494.23s -> 10494.55s]  What?
[10501.89s -> 10502.21s]  What?
[10505.57s -> 10506.45s]  He's still in.
[10508.80s -> 10509.28s]  He's still.
[10509.28s -> 10510.48s]  Where did you come from?
[10513.16s -> 10513.64s]  All right.
[10513.64s -> 10515.24s]  It's time to close you up for real.
[10515.24s -> 10519.33s]  Where's like the actual fence?
[10519.33s -> 10520.05s]  Rail fence.
[10520.77s -> 10524.18s]  We need like a dinosaur fence.
[10530.20s -> 10530.52s]  There.
[10531.08s -> 10533.16s]  No, I don't want to do an electric fence.
[10533.16s -> 10533.96s]  Dinosaur fence.
[10533.96s -> 10534.36s]  There it is.
[10540.52s -> 10541.24s]  He got out.
[10541.24s -> 10542.20s]  He actually got out.
[10549.70s -> 10550.50s]  All right.
[10550.50s -> 10551.14s]  He's contained.
[10560.55s -> 10561.67s]  Where was he going to go?
[10561.67s -> 10562.63s]  Nowhere.
[10562.63s -> 10563.43s]  All the way up here.
[10567.36s -> 10569.36s]  I need to like replace this whole fence.
[10577.88s -> 10578.60s]  From here.
[10578.60s -> 10579.00s]  Here we go.
[10579.00s -> 10590.48s]  He wants to be free.
[10591.28s -> 10594.96s]  Well, he should have thought about that before he murdered his cellmate.
[10594.96s -> 10595.84s]  I mean his roommate.
[10595.84s -> 10596.48s]  His roommate.
[10597.44s -> 10598.87s]  His other...
[10598.87s -> 10599.51s]  His roommate.
[10610.85s -> 10611.41s]  All right.
[10611.41s -> 10612.37s]  He's closed off.
[10612.37s -> 10613.81s]  We have a real fence now.
[10614.53s -> 10619.44s]  Actually, I can probably delete this and then expand it a little more.
[10620.48s -> 10620.96s]  His habitat...
[10620.96s -> 10622.40s]  I'll put his actual habitat back here.
[10623.04s -> 10628.15s]  Oops.
[10628.15s -> 10628.87s]  Okay.
[10628.87s -> 10633.62s]  So his actual place to sleep is gonna go right here.
[10634.34s -> 10635.59s]  Where are you?
[10636.07s -> 10641.48s]  There you go.
[10641.48s -> 10642.76s]  Right in the corner there.
[10643.64s -> 10644.36s]  Hey, look at that.
[10645.91s -> 10648.07s]  Have a good restful sleep, T-Rex.
[10651.48s -> 10652.52s]  You have toys.
[10652.52s -> 10653.40s]  You got stuff to do.
[10653.40s -> 10654.12s]  You got food.
[10655.08s -> 10655.72s]  Let's give him a ball.
[10655.72s -> 10656.52s]  Look, he's going for a bath.
[10657.62s -> 10657.94s]  See?
[10657.94s -> 10658.18s]  Look.
[10663.48s -> 10664.04s]  Why can't you...
[10668.39s -> 10670.15s]  This is a dinosaur fence.
[10671.27s -> 10673.43s]  Specifically to hold dinosaurs.
[10674.23s -> 10676.47s]  How did you get out of here?
[10676.47s -> 10683.57s]  He found the weak point in the structure.
[10684.21s -> 10693.91s]  He's not gonna be able to go anywhere anyways.
[10695.64s -> 10696.76s]  Where are you going?
[10699.25s -> 10700.45s]  Are you going?
[10704.36s -> 10704.84s]  Hold on.
[10708.79s -> 10710.55s]  He's escaping the whole zoo.
[10712.92s -> 10713.24s]  Is he?
[10713.96s -> 10723.51s]  This biome is not suitable for the T-Rex.
[10723.51s -> 10724.63s]  Well, that's his own fault.
[10738.31s -> 10739.99s]  Get back in there where you belong.
[10742.12s -> 10743.24s]  You don't belong out here.
[10743.88s -> 10744.76s]  What are you mad at?
[10745.40s -> 10747.14s]  What's he angry with?
[10747.14s -> 10747.78s]  What's happening?
[10748.34s -> 10755.67s]  Who's he angry with?
[10756.23s -> 10767.76s]  Here, I'll give you a bath.
[10767.76s -> 10769.20s]  American Bee before is pregnant.
[10771.17s -> 10771.49s]  Okay.
[10774.02s -> 10774.98s]  Is this where you want to be?
[10775.62s -> 10776.82s]  I'll put a fence around you here.
[10779.16s -> 10780.04s]  No, he's going back.
[10786.56s -> 10790.84s]  I think he's realizing that this is not where I wanted to go at all.
[10791.48s -> 10799.57s]  He needs to go back to his habitat.
[10800.29s -> 10807.54s]  You're going the long way.
[10810.69s -> 10812.53s]  Where is he going?
[10812.53s -> 10814.21s]  He's going all the way around.
[10814.85s -> 10821.06s]  What's the correct biome?
[10821.06s -> 10821.54s]  Tropical.
[10823.57s -> 10825.49s]  Uh-oh, he's getting closer to civilization here.
[10835.16s -> 10836.44s]  He looks so tired though.
[10836.44s -> 10837.16s]  What's he going to do?
[10840.37s -> 10843.01s]  He smells the customers.
[10850.82s -> 10852.18s]  He's doing stealth.
[10852.74s -> 10854.02s]  He's sneaking up on everybody.
[10854.02s -> 10855.06s]  Nobody knows he's here.
[10857.20s -> 10859.04s]  This is the stealthiest T-Rex ever.
[10878.20s -> 10881.12s]  He just wants to go to the zoo.
[10881.76s -> 10884.95s]  Oh, look at that over there.
[10884.95s -> 10888.66s]  That's a cool gorilla.
[10888.66s -> 10890.32s]  What about the beavers?
[10893.52s -> 10895.60s]  He goes to the front, takes money out of the ATM.
[10898.04s -> 10899.40s]  Why is nobody upset about this?
[10903.01s -> 10904.37s]  He just turned into a customer.
[10917.08s -> 10922.04s]  The lady up there is still giving the educational course on the T-Rex.
[10924.58s -> 10929.32s]  If this T-Rex goes into a car and the car drives off, I'm going to shit my pants.
[10936.29s -> 10937.65s]  No, don't shit on somebody.
[10939.30s -> 10939.94s]  Okay, good.
[10943.38s -> 10944.90s]  He's just leaving the park.
[10950.28s -> 10951.48s]  Uh-oh, he's getting angry.
[10954.29s -> 10955.49s]  I can't find my car.
[10956.05s -> 10958.47s]  Did I park it in B1?
[10962.15s -> 10963.51s]  Should have taken a picture of it.
[10969.56s -> 10971.56s]  One dinosaur has roamed the earth.
[10977.30s -> 10979.94s]  No, no, he's going to the beaver enclosure.
[10979.94s -> 10981.30s]  The beavers are going to get out now.
[10985.41s -> 10994.16s]  He got an extra life.
[11004.26s -> 11005.22s]  He is the car.
[11005.22s -> 11007.76s]  Here goes the beaver.
[11007.76s -> 11009.60s]  Oh no, a beaver escaped.
[11009.60s -> 11017.30s]  The beaver is not going to hurt anybody, right?
[11017.86s -> 11023.22s]  If the T-Rex is less aggressive than a fucking beaver, I'm going to be fucking so pissed off.
[11030.42s -> 11031.62s]  Who's beatboxing?
[11032.90s -> 11033.86s]  Oh shit.
[11036.23s -> 11037.75s]  Oh no, no, no, no, no.
[11037.75s -> 11038.71s]  He actually woke up.
[11042.18s -> 11042.98s]  He woke up.
[11048.53s -> 11049.65s]  He's going to drink water.
[11050.29s -> 11052.29s]  He's going to drink water out of his phone.
[11056.07s -> 11058.32s]  He was just thirsty.
[11058.32s -> 11059.12s]  That's all he wanted.
[11062.21s -> 11063.73s]  I'll put more water in the food dish.
[11063.73s -> 11064.85s]  Look at how pissed off the beaver is.
[11064.85s -> 11065.73s]  The beaver is going to fight him.
[11067.14s -> 11068.66s]  That's a territorial beaver.
[11069.30s -> 11071.59s]  He's strutting his ass out.
[11072.15s -> 11075.22s]  American beaver has been put in a crate.
[11075.22s -> 11086.37s]  Why would you come in the exhibit here?
[11087.01s -> 11101.73s]  Where's the nearest beaver?
[11101.73s -> 11105.09s]  All right, just yeah.
[11106.74s -> 11107.62s]  Don't fuck with me.
[11108.26s -> 11119.43s]  I gotta get a photo of that.
[11119.43s -> 11135.09s]  Wait, did you just, did you just come over?
[11144.40s -> 11145.28s]  That's kind of scary.
[11145.28s -> 11146.00s]  I'm not going to lie.
[11152.77s -> 11155.24s]  Honey, I think it's getting closer.
[11155.24s -> 11173.67s]  Out of film.
[11173.67s -> 11175.11s]  We're just filming a movie over here.
[11175.11s -> 11176.07s]  Don't worry.
[11176.07s -> 11180.10s]  He really is just so fucked up.
[11180.10s -> 11181.38s]  Like what's his deal?
[11181.38s -> 11188.36s]  Another birth.
[11188.36s -> 11192.21s]  Let the beaver out.
[11192.21s -> 11192.53s]  You know what?
[11192.53s -> 11193.17s]  Fuck it.
[11193.17s -> 11194.13s]  It's time for a battle.
[11194.77s -> 11199.04s]  Who's going to win?
[11199.60s -> 11206.58s]  It's time for a real battle.
[11217.28s -> 11218.64s]  What if they start having sex?
[11224.00s -> 11224.48s]  Uh-oh.
[11227.32s -> 11228.12s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11228.12s -> 11235.80s]  No, don't fight the T-Rex.
[11235.80s -> 11236.76s]  Oh my god.
[11236.76s -> 11237.88s]  He's freaking out.
[11237.88s -> 11251.33s]  He's freaking out.
[11251.33s -> 11253.94s]  They're working together.
[11253.94s -> 11255.46s]  They should not be working together.
[11261.56s -> 11263.08s]  The T-Rex was just put in a crate.
[11285.52s -> 11286.64s]  All right, it's time to.
[11286.64s -> 11289.48s]  Oh, I need to.
[11290.28s -> 11290.93s]  I need to.
[11290.93s -> 11292.85s]  Where's my list of staff?
[11292.85s -> 11300.02s]  I want to get rid of this staff.
[11300.02s -> 11309.11s]  I need my staff list.
[11309.11s -> 11313.36s]  No, I don't want more of them.
[11313.36s -> 11313.84s]  Where is it?
[11313.84s -> 11314.48s]  How do I get there?
[11315.12s -> 11316.08s]  From here, right?
[11316.08s -> 11316.58s]  No.
[11318.32s -> 11324.28s]  Zoo stats, zoo status, photo album, zoo fame.
[11325.00s -> 11328.80s]  There we go.
[11328.80s -> 11329.30s]  Okay.
[11330.96s -> 11332.40s]  So we need some new staff.
[11333.36s -> 11334.92s]  I need to.
[11334.92s -> 11336.36s]  I want to fire literally everybody.
[11338.95s -> 11339.43s]  You're gone.
[11340.15s -> 11341.38s]  You're gone.
[11342.02s -> 11343.35s]  You know what I'm saying?
[11343.35s -> 11343.99s]  Let them fight.
[11346.40s -> 11348.56s]  Dude, is this King Kong versus Godzilla?
[11351.17s -> 11352.13s]  I thought that was the T-Rex.
[11352.13s -> 11352.85s]  It wasn't, apparently.
[11352.85s -> 11353.57s]  Where's the T-Rex?
[11360.34s -> 11361.14s]  Everybody wants to come in here
[11361.14s -> 11362.82s]  and drink out of the same water bowl.
[11362.82s -> 11363.46s]  All right, let's go.
[11383.52s -> 11384.40s]  What are they doing?
[11387.62s -> 11389.62s]  They're just like walking around in circles.
[11390.68s -> 11392.36s]  Tyrannosaurus 1 is really hungry.
[11404.68s -> 11405.80s]  He's going all the way up there.
[11405.80s -> 11406.20s]  Hold on.
[11415.84s -> 11416.64s]  Uh-oh.
[11416.64s -> 11421.44s]  Oh no.
[11421.44s -> 11423.20s]  No, he's just breaking through fences.
[11423.84s -> 11428.02s]  He's coming in to steal his food.
[11475.01s -> 11483.59s]  Where are they all going?
[11483.59s -> 11485.19s]  They're just eating the food.
[11486.05s -> 11499.46s]  They're just sharing the food.
[11499.46s -> 11509.04s]  This kid is so excited.
[11509.04s -> 11510.32s]  Yeah, I can't believe it.
[11510.32s -> 11512.00s]  It's just like Jurassic Park.
[11512.00s -> 11522.77s]  What are they eating over there?
[11570.96s -> 11573.52s]  There are more animals outside than people.
[11574.16s -> 11576.18s]  This lady's still giving me a presentation.
[11589.46s -> 11617.35s]  This is the line for the bathroom.
[11622.21s -> 11623.57s]  Oh God.
[11623.57s -> 11624.53s]  I'm up in my fort.
[11624.53s -> 11625.41s]  They can't get up here.
[11648.52s -> 11649.16s]  All right.
[11649.16s -> 11652.23s]  Well, that was fun.
[11652.23s -> 11668.40s]  I want to try one more thing.
[11668.40s -> 11670.48s]  Hold on.
[11670.48s -> 11680.40s]  No, don't save the current game.
[11680.40s -> 11681.36s]  Almost half a star.
[11681.36s -> 11682.24s]  I know, right?
[11682.24s -> 11683.57s]  Doing well.
[11686.72s -> 11688.64s]  You need to go back in here.
[11688.64s -> 11692.66s]  Let me fix this.
[11692.66s -> 11695.91s]  So what's the deal here?
[11695.91s -> 11701.32s]  He can't...
[11701.32s -> 11702.20s]  Electric fence.
[11703.64s -> 11705.88s]  Is this the only way I can contain a T-Rex?
[11705.88s -> 11714.39s]  What if he starts to smash through it?
[11714.39s -> 11724.37s]  Oh, come on.
[11724.37s -> 11725.09s]  Move out of the way.
[11725.09s -> 11729.99s]  I can't believe you can put dinosaurs in this game.
[11731.75s -> 11732.87s]  He's going to get a shock.
[11735.83s -> 11737.11s]  I forget everything we were just doing.
[11738.96s -> 11743.04s]  Something about a place for them to go up to see the T-Rex or something.
[11744.00s -> 11748.77s]  What's my favorite wild animal?
[11756.84s -> 11758.28s]  What is my favorite wild animal?
[11759.99s -> 11761.43s]  It was legal to own five of them.
[11764.04s -> 11765.24s]  Favorite wild animal.
[11766.84s -> 11767.56s]  Definitely a...
[11770.63s -> 11771.43s]  Probably a laptop.
[11773.38s -> 11775.14s]  Yeah, like a HP laptop.
[11775.70s -> 11796.71s]  What was your question?
[11796.71s -> 11797.59s]  What's my favorite...
[11797.59s -> 11798.55s]  What's my favorite animal?
[11802.21s -> 11802.77s]  Probably like a...
[11803.33s -> 11803.73s]  I don't know.
[11804.29s -> 11805.96s]  Armadillo.
[11805.96s -> 11806.36s]  Be cool.
[11809.99s -> 11810.79s]  I missed a spot?
[11814.56s -> 11814.96s]  No, I didn't.
[11814.96s -> 11816.00s]  Everything's fine.
[11816.00s -> 11816.88s]  Oh, I did miss a spot.
[11816.88s -> 11817.28s]  You're right.
[11818.79s -> 11819.83s]  Good catch there.
[11824.08s -> 11824.90s]  Okay.
[11824.90s -> 11828.74s]  He's contained and he's not very happy, but that's his own problem.
[11832.29s -> 11833.33s]  Exercise level.
[11833.97s -> 11836.44s]  So go interact with this thing.
[11836.44s -> 11837.48s]  What do you think I put it here for?
[11838.20s -> 11845.01s]  Okay, now I need to get in.
[11847.51s -> 11848.23s]  Now you can get in.
[11849.27s -> 11850.95s]  Food, water, dinosaur.
[11852.74s -> 11853.94s]  45 cents.
[11854.58s -> 11857.35s]  Hello, people.
[11865.11s -> 11866.39s]  What the fuck are they doing?
[11866.39s -> 11868.15s]  Why are they walking in circles up here?
[11873.54s -> 11875.62s]  Are they making a whirlpool on the way up?
[11876.34s -> 11880.72s]  All right, now let's get...
[11880.72s -> 11881.20s]  What was I gonna...
[11881.20s -> 11881.52s]  Oh, yeah.
[11881.52s -> 11882.32s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11882.32s -> 11883.68s]  I want whales.
[11884.32s -> 11885.60s]  That sounds like fun.
[11885.60s -> 11889.36s]  So I need a tank enclosure, right?
[11890.47s -> 11891.27s]  Of some sort.
[11891.83s -> 11896.79s]  What do I need for that?
[11897.51s -> 11900.93s]  I want to make a couple of whale sharks.
[11907.16s -> 11909.88s]  All right, biome and benthic.
[11912.08s -> 11914.37s]  Okay, I need water.
[11915.17s -> 11915.41s]  What?
[11915.41s -> 11916.61s]  Can I just put them in a lake?
[11922.20s -> 11922.68s]  I don't know.
[11939.22s -> 11942.34s]  This biome is not suitable for whale shark.
[11942.34s -> 11942.74s]  Well, hold on.
[11942.74s -> 11950.23s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11950.23s -> 11950.47s]  There.
[11950.47s -> 11951.19s]  Okay, tank.
[11951.19s -> 11951.67s]  There it is.
[11951.67s -> 11951.99s]  All right.
[11951.99s -> 11952.95s]  I need to...
[11952.95s -> 11954.15s]  What the hell am I thinking?
[11954.15s -> 11958.08s]  I can make a diving board.
[11960.96s -> 11962.88s]  All right, I need to get rid of this then.
[11963.52s -> 11965.16s]  So let's go back.
[11965.16s -> 11966.20s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[11966.84s -> 11973.54s]  How do I replace this?
[11975.94s -> 11980.16s]  Can I fill this up?
[11981.80s -> 11982.92s]  I can't fill this.
[11982.92s -> 11984.79s]  I don't know what the hell I've done here.
[11985.67s -> 11988.28s]  I created a huge problem for myself.
[11989.16s -> 11995.96s]  So I need a new biome.
[11996.60s -> 11997.48s]  Get rid of all this shit.
[11999.32s -> 12002.50s]  All right, biome.
[12002.50s -> 12003.22s]  What biome?
[12003.22s -> 12003.94s]  This is tank.
[12003.94s -> 12005.22s]  Tank, tank, tank, tank, tank.
[12006.02s -> 12009.52s]  So this is tank wall.
[12012.69s -> 12013.89s]  Raise tank wall.
[12013.89s -> 12014.29s]  No.
[12014.29s -> 12015.33s]  All right, let's go like this.
[12016.05s -> 12024.96s]  What the fuck are you doing?
[12025.52s -> 12033.97s]  I need to extend this shit out.
[12033.97s -> 12034.29s]  Hold on.
[12035.01s -> 12044.37s]  It's on like a cliff.
[12044.37s -> 12045.09s]  It's not going to work.
[12045.09s -> 12046.13s]  I need to flatten this out.
[12048.52s -> 12049.00s]  Flatten it.
[12059.52s -> 12060.24s]  That should work.
[12060.24s -> 12061.20s]  Get rid of the rocks.
[12063.76s -> 12064.16s]  Ah!
[12067.33s -> 12070.37s]  Oh!
[12070.45s -> 12071.09s]  What?
[12071.09s -> 12083.22s]  It's all right.
[12083.22s -> 12089.41s]  Okay, here we go.
[12089.97s -> 12109.75s]  What is going on?
[12114.80s -> 12116.88s]  Raw fucking rectangle.
[12120.20s -> 12122.28s]  It's because I was on the rectangle mode.
[12122.28s -> 12123.64s]  I need to be on free form.
[12129.57s -> 12131.52s]  Good luck.
[12131.52s -> 12133.12s]  How am I even going to fix this?
[12133.12s -> 12134.64s]  Okay, I can fix it like this.
[12135.44s -> 12139.65s]  No, I can't.
[12139.65s -> 12141.09s]  Jesus Christ.
[12141.09s -> 12155.16s]  All right, we're good.
[12155.16s -> 12184.50s]  All right, let's do it.
[12185.46s -> 12186.69s]  I'm sorry.
[12186.69s -> 12187.73s]  That was fucking loud.
[12187.73s -> 12191.43s]  So now I need to go back here.
[12191.43s -> 12193.04s]  Free form mode.
[12193.04s -> 12194.08s]  Tank wall.
[12194.08s -> 12210.80s]  Bingo.
[12210.80s -> 12212.56s]  More beaver pregnancies.
[12213.36s -> 12217.54s]  Perfect.
[12217.54s -> 12224.28s]  Why is this not suitable for whale shark?
[12224.28s -> 12231.64s]  What's wrong with it?
[12231.64s -> 12241.46s]  What's wrong with it?
[12241.46s -> 12250.29s]  What's the problem?
[12253.59s -> 12254.23s]  Salt water.
[12254.23s -> 12254.71s]  How do I?
[12254.71s -> 12263.19s]  Does there a check a box for salt water?
[12263.19s -> 12264.55s]  Change the biome.
[12264.55s -> 12278.34s]  They can't survive in pools.
[12278.34s -> 12284.76s]  So you're telling me that benthic.
[12284.76s -> 12288.42s]  So I did have...
[12288.42s -> 12301.84s]  Problem solved.
[12301.84s -> 12303.44s]  I turned the water benthic.
[12303.44s -> 12306.63s]  That's a 3000 IQ play right there.
[12318.50s -> 12318.90s]  All right.
[12318.90s -> 12319.94s]  So what do you eat?
[12319.94s -> 12326.50s]  Let me get some help here.
[12327.30s -> 12331.28s]  Oh, we got a reef.
[12331.28s -> 12336.64s]  Food box with plankton.
[12336.64s -> 12341.59s]  We got a little toy or something.
[12341.59s -> 12344.13s]  A buoy.
[12344.13s -> 12345.17s]  Weird clam thing.
[12345.81s -> 12347.89s]  You don't need a habitat.
[12347.89s -> 12349.01s]  You just sleep on the ground.
[12350.37s -> 12351.41s]  A couple of cool rocks.
[12352.13s -> 12353.38s]  Nice fireworks.
[12354.02s -> 12356.29s]  Get some starfish in here.
[12359.27s -> 12359.99s]  All right, nice.
[12360.88s -> 12362.16s]  So this is ready to go.
[12362.16s -> 12362.96s]  Let's make some money.
[12372.12s -> 12373.88s]  I need this to keep going across.
[12374.68s -> 12379.78s]  See, look it.
[12380.34s -> 12383.43s]  I should be a video game designer.
[12385.28s -> 12386.32s]  Imagine this is a town.
[12393.59s -> 12398.90s]  All right, that's good.
[12402.53s -> 12404.37s]  In fact, go all the way up.
[12404.37s -> 12405.49s]  So we can look at the glass.
[12407.01s -> 12412.93s]  Why is it just a rock in the middle of the road?
[12412.93s -> 12413.41s]  Get out of here.
[12414.29s -> 12419.67s]  So here's the bathroom.
[12419.67s -> 12420.31s]  Now we need...
[12421.19s -> 12422.04s]  Oh, fuck.
[12422.04s -> 12422.36s]  I forgot.
[12422.36s -> 12422.76s]  Did I fire?
[12422.76s -> 12423.80s]  No, I didn't fire everybody.
[12424.52s -> 12429.76s]  What does American people want to do?
[12431.56s -> 12431.72s]  For...
[12431.72s -> 12434.12s]  Okay, for one second, I thought that was blood
[12434.76s -> 12436.20s]  all over that and pouring out of the front.
[12436.84s -> 12438.39s]  Say, what the hell happened?
[12438.39s -> 12439.75s]  So wait, you can't find a good mate?
[12440.96s -> 12441.36s]  Why not?
[12442.00s -> 12443.30s]  What's wrong?
[12447.86s -> 12448.50s]  You need a mate.
[12449.22s -> 12452.50s]  You're doing fine.
[12455.40s -> 12456.36s]  Here, I'll help you.
[12477.57s -> 12479.33s]  Name the beavers after chat.
[12480.13s -> 12481.41s]  There's like 40 of them.
[12492.32s -> 12493.44s]  No, I can't do like...
[12493.44s -> 12495.52s]  I can't do like Beaver Rick.
[12495.52s -> 12497.60s]  Because that's...
[12498.50s -> 12499.86s]  I'm not doing Beaver Rick.
[12501.24s -> 12506.88s]  Uh, Bevo.
[12511.94s -> 12519.72s]  Bevo, Stevo, Ornelius.
[12529.27s -> 12546.98s]  Uh, okay.
[12546.98s -> 12562.63s]  Uh, so long.
[12562.63s -> 12563.27s]  Uh, no.
[12566.26s -> 12568.10s]  No, no, no, not not schlaw.
[12568.10s -> 12568.90s]  No.
[12568.90s -> 12576.63s]  Uh, uh...
[12579.09s -> 12588.32s]  All right, there are your names.
[12588.32s -> 12589.04s]  They're done.
[12589.04s -> 12597.11s]  All right, what happened since I was gone?
[12597.11s -> 12597.99s]  I need to make...
[12597.99s -> 12598.87s]  I need to make money over here.
[12598.87s -> 12599.67s]  Come on.
[12599.67s -> 12601.97s]  You need a friend.
[12601.97s -> 12602.45s]  Okay.
[12602.45s -> 12603.09s]  So I need a...
[12603.09s -> 12603.49s]  This is a...
[12604.05s -> 12607.72s]  Okay, so we're gonna do...
[12607.72s -> 12608.20s]  We're gonna do...
[12614.08s -> 12615.52s]  We need left and right here.
[12616.08s -> 12620.56s]  So this is...
[12621.28s -> 12623.52s]  I need...
[12623.52s -> 12632.85s]  Okay.
[12633.57s -> 12643.35s]  Yin and Yang, left and right.
[12643.91s -> 12644.47s]  Up and down.
[12645.03s -> 12650.96s]  Should just name them Yin and Yang.
[12650.96s -> 12666.82s]  All right, so now the baby needs to be called middle.
[12666.82s -> 12669.25s]  Good.
[12669.33s -> 12674.34s]  More American beavers.
[12674.34s -> 12676.58s]  Now I want to add...
[12676.58s -> 12677.94s]  Let me see what it looks like from afar.
[12678.50s -> 12678.98s]  Pretty cool.
[12680.02s -> 12680.66s]  Where's T-Rex?
[12680.66s -> 12681.38s]  T-Rex happy?
[12682.74s -> 12683.46s]  Actually, yeah.
[12684.10s -> 12686.24s]  The T-Rex is actually having a good time.
[12690.47s -> 12692.39s]  I mean, at this point, I think it, like, seriously.
[12693.38s -> 12694.66s]  This zoo needs some dessert carts.
[12694.66s -> 12695.22s]  I'm exhausted.
[12695.22s -> 12696.18s]  I need a place to rest.
[12697.99s -> 12700.55s]  Maybe if you didn't walk in circles the whole entire time.
[12701.19s -> 12707.38s]  What do I do about this?
[12707.38s -> 12708.66s]  Because they're just clogging the whole thing.
[12709.38s -> 12721.59s]  Just get out of the way.
[12726.98s -> 12728.82s]  Just get up there.
[12728.82s -> 12730.98s]  Why is he sprinting over here so fast?
[12730.98s -> 12731.78s]  What's his problem?
[12731.78s -> 12732.42s]  What are you doing?
[12732.98s -> 12735.60s]  What's wrong with him?
[12739.48s -> 12740.36s]  That's what...
[12740.36s -> 12741.56s]  That's what this was for, huh?
[12742.44s -> 12744.90s]  I gotta get over there right now
[12744.90s -> 12746.74s]  because I gotta rake this shit as fast as I can.
[12748.56s -> 12749.76s]  All right, well, whatever.
[12749.76s -> 12755.01s]  I need to use the bathroom.
[12755.01s -> 12756.29s]  I can't wait to see some animals.
[12763.92s -> 12765.44s]  Now he's running in circles.
[12766.55s -> 12767.03s]  Thank God.
[12767.67s -> 12781.72s]  I shouldn't have to do this.
[12785.80s -> 12786.92s]  It's time to go home.
[12787.64s -> 12789.91s]  Well, they...
[12789.91s -> 12791.59s]  Was that guy's name Sandler?
[12791.59s -> 12798.98s]  I thought it was Adam Sandler.
[12798.98s -> 12800.18s]  Well, when this first came up,
[12800.18s -> 12802.42s]  I thought they said I can smell the restroom from here.
[12803.14s -> 12806.20s]  Oh, that's disgusting.
[12808.64s -> 12810.16s]  That's absolutely revolting.
[12810.72s -> 12815.49s]  They're not gonna ever leave here.
[12816.05s -> 12820.48s]  I don't really have a solution.
[12822.39s -> 12824.79s]  Hold on, are you gonna get like a big roar or no?
[12825.51s -> 12827.51s]  No one's even giving me any money.
[12829.54s -> 12832.10s]  Need more water for right and left over here.
[12833.67s -> 12834.23s]  I will add it.
[12834.79s -> 12842.63s]  I'm going for it, I'm going for it.
[12842.63s -> 12844.39s]  It's kind of in a weird spot, isn't it?
[12844.95s -> 12855.57s]  It's not the right biome.
[12857.56s -> 12858.84s]  Will it mix the water together?
[12860.20s -> 12860.76s]  There we go.
[12860.76s -> 12861.08s]  Look at that.
[12861.08s -> 12861.88s]  I don't even have to do anything.
[12870.26s -> 12871.70s]  Artifact is looking great.
[12873.32s -> 12873.96s]  Artifact?
[12874.68s -> 12878.04s]  I'm not gonna play artifact.
[12882.20s -> 12883.64s]  No, today was just the chill day
[12883.64s -> 12885.16s]  where I wanted just to play something.
[12885.96s -> 12886.36s]  Hang out.
[12892.61s -> 12893.97s]  Why would I ever play artifact?
[12894.53s -> 12896.32s]  I really want to get rid of this.
[12902.31s -> 12902.79s]  There we go.
[12902.79s -> 12903.03s]  All right.
[12903.03s -> 12903.99s]  Now you get enough room, right?
[12904.95s -> 12907.19s]  Need more places to rest.
[12910.84s -> 12911.40s]  Well, shit.
[12912.20s -> 12912.84s]  There's plenty of...
[12912.84s -> 12913.88s]  No one's even using them.
[12915.89s -> 12917.01s]  Am I really getting complaints
[12917.01s -> 12918.69s]  about there's nowhere for me to rest
[12918.69s -> 12920.61s]  and all the benches are empty?
[12922.00s -> 12922.48s]  Empty.
[12922.48s -> 12922.96s]  All of them.
[12925.62s -> 12926.34s]  Oh, really?
[12926.34s -> 12927.38s]  Was it you that complained?
[12946.64s -> 12947.44s]  That dude myself.
[12948.32s -> 12960.52s]  Put it in the bag.
[12960.52s -> 12961.56s]  I just had the bag out.
[12965.88s -> 12966.44s]  I'm tired.
[12966.44s -> 12966.92s]  I'm tired.
[12966.92s -> 12967.40s]  I'm tired.
[12967.40s -> 12968.04s]  I'm tired.
[12971.08s -> 12971.97s]  Fine.
[12971.97s -> 12972.45s]  Do you want...
[12973.01s -> 12974.69s]  Am I gonna put out like beds and shit here?
[12977.92s -> 12978.24s]  All right.
[12978.24s -> 12979.44s]  Where is giant bed?
[12979.44s -> 12987.12s]  Ooh, no, that's fine.
[12987.12s -> 12987.68s]  I can stay there.
[12996.76s -> 12997.56s]  Park information.
[12998.12s -> 13001.09s]  That's kind of important.
[13002.76s -> 13004.20s]  What about like just sitting down here?
[13006.92s -> 13008.28s]  Can I lose this game?
[13008.28s -> 13009.48s]  Not when I have infinite money.
[13011.94s -> 13013.14s]  More places to rest.
[13013.14s -> 13014.10s]  What the fuck?
[13014.10s -> 13015.38s]  I need a place to rest.
[13016.26s -> 13022.21s]  Is this the only thing they can see?
[13024.24s -> 13026.08s]  Fat is going to give birth.
[13026.64s -> 13027.12s]  All right.
[13028.21s -> 13028.77s]  That's good.
[13039.35s -> 13040.47s]  There ain't nobody listening.
[13041.11s -> 13045.83s]  Those people are still complaining about the bench.
[13048.39s -> 13049.35s]  That's a great move.
[13050.07s -> 13052.39s]  How do I up your salary?
[13053.59s -> 13058.34s]  And so what else can we do for him?
[13058.34s -> 13058.82s]  Okay.
[13058.82s -> 13059.32s]  Now.
[13060.66s -> 13061.22s]  Okay.
[13061.22s -> 13061.72s]  Now.
[13064.66s -> 13065.06s]  What's happening?
[13065.06s -> 13065.54s]  What's going on?
[13066.74s -> 13067.94s]  Oh, they're just having babies.
[13069.70s -> 13079.12s]  It was inevitable.
[13081.46s -> 13082.50s]  Oh my god.
[13083.78s -> 13102.85s]  It's too many beavers.
[13102.85s -> 13103.49s]  They're really...
[13103.49s -> 13110.07s]  And it's ruining my whole aesthetic here.
[13110.07s -> 13111.75s]  Oh, Steve-O needs more space.
[13111.75s -> 13113.19s]  I better take it seriously now.
[13113.99s -> 13114.49s]  Okay.
[13117.41s -> 13153.64s]  Uh-oh.
[13153.64s -> 13155.48s]  It's not the Chad beaver.
[13155.48s -> 13157.81s]  Don't go after the Chad beaver.
[13157.81s -> 13161.35s]  Oh, no.
[13163.49s -> 13164.61s]  He's gonna get him.
[13164.61s -> 13169.49s]  How's the space looking now?
[13171.19s -> 13172.15s]  We still out of space?
[13173.54s -> 13175.46s]  From race and has died.
[13176.26s -> 13177.62s]  Of old age.
[13177.62s -> 13201.70s]  We're good?
[13201.70s -> 13202.66s]  He's not even eating them.
[13202.66s -> 13204.02s]  He's just killing them for no reason.
[13204.02s -> 13205.06s]  Well, don't worry.
[13205.06s -> 13206.26s]  I have a solution for that.
[13206.26s -> 13207.94s]  Remember we talked about recycling?
[13208.50s -> 13209.70s]  The natural order of the world?
[13212.10s -> 13212.58s]  All right.
[13212.58s -> 13215.06s]  After he kills like three more people, you'll see.
[13223.35s -> 13224.07s]  I think that won't...
[13224.07s -> 13225.51s]  I think that beaver was about to give birth.
[13235.51s -> 13236.87s]  How do they still need more space?
[13240.87s -> 13241.19s]  Hold on.
[13241.19s -> 13242.63s]  How do I get to my photo album?
[13247.28s -> 13248.56s]  No, I want to get to the photo album.
[13249.20s -> 13252.92s]  How do I delete pictures?
[13253.48s -> 13263.20s]  Look, these are so awful.
[13263.20s -> 13263.84s]  Delete them all.
[13267.64s -> 13269.72s]  I have like four pictures of the trash.
[13269.72s -> 13282.34s]  I want to keep those ones.
[13285.57s -> 13286.69s]  I like that one.
[13286.69s -> 13287.65s]  I like this string.
[13288.29s -> 13289.73s]  Picture the ground.
[13290.82s -> 13291.06s]  All right.
[13291.06s -> 13291.86s]  Let's see if I can get it.
[13292.42s -> 13294.74s]  I want to get a mid-jump tiger shot.
[13300.23s -> 13301.03s]  Into the water.
[13301.03s -> 13301.53s]  Jesus.
[13305.08s -> 13305.48s]  No, no.
[13305.48s -> 13306.12s]  Don't...
[13306.12s -> 13306.84s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[13307.40s -> 13321.32s]  Who's he going for?
[13321.32s -> 13321.80s]  Who's he going for?
[13322.60s -> 13324.20s]  Who's he going for?
[13326.56s -> 13327.36s]  Right here.
[13327.36s -> 13332.92s]  Oh, he's gonna kill them all.
[13332.92s -> 13333.64s]  I gotta get him out of here.
[13333.64s -> 13334.68s]  He's gonna kill them all, actually.
[13334.68s -> 13335.80s]  He really might.
[13335.80s -> 13338.37s]  Okay, good work.
[13338.37s -> 13344.12s]  Remember we talked about recycling?
[13351.92s -> 13352.56s]  Not wasted.
[13353.12s -> 13357.92s]  See, somebody adopted a cave line.
[13357.92s -> 13359.20s]  Don't ask me who the hell would do that.
[13359.76s -> 13365.44s]  See, he's got food.
[13366.16s -> 13369.46s]  He's got food for probably the next five or six days.
[13370.18s -> 13373.43s]  See, he's giving it a sniff.
[13374.15s -> 13377.28s]  He's not like it.
[13377.28s -> 13377.84s]  No, he likes it.
[13377.84s -> 13380.74s]  See, he's happy.
[13381.54s -> 13386.69s]  This is the biggest traction here.
[13387.41s -> 13390.61s]  $4,400 of donations.
[13390.61s -> 13392.45s]  That's pretty great considering...
[13393.17s -> 13397.80s]  I don't think the beaver exhibit has even come close.
[13397.88s -> 13398.44s]  Not even half.
[13399.08s -> 13402.21s]  The guests are crying.
[13402.93s -> 13406.29s]  Well, maybe if the guests actually listened to their own advice
[13406.29s -> 13408.29s]  and sat on the benches that are here,
[13408.29s -> 13409.49s]  ready for them to be sat on.
[13410.29s -> 13414.77s]  They're available.
[13420.68s -> 13421.96s]  I've had just about enough of...
[13422.76s -> 13423.64s]  What are they saying?
[13423.64s -> 13424.28s]  I'm exhausted.
[13424.28s -> 13424.84s]  I'm exhausted.
[13424.84s -> 13425.56s]  I'm exhausted.
[13441.17s -> 13442.05s]  You exhausted now?
[13444.45s -> 13446.05s]  Holy shit, they're running off to the end.
[13446.05s -> 13446.85s]  They...
[13446.85s -> 13449.24s]  It worked.
[13451.57s -> 13452.37s]  Fixed the ramp?
[13452.37s -> 13453.49s]  What's wrong with the ramp?
[13458.98s -> 13460.50s]  They were just sprinting off the edges.
[13461.06s -> 13485.09s]  Okay, I fixed it.
[13485.09s -> 13486.69s]  Sacrifices must be made.
[13487.09s -> 13487.65s]  Sorry, guys.
[13498.50s -> 13502.37s]  I mean, that's up there, isn't it?
[13503.09s -> 13508.40s]  Maybe the 70-foot plateau wasn't necessary.
[13510.39s -> 13513.43s]  No, it really wasn't, but this was already here,
[13513.43s -> 13514.47s]  and I thought it might have been cool.
[13517.65s -> 13518.77s]  Pave over the people.
[13518.77s -> 13519.49s]  Can they get up now?
[13520.13s -> 13522.44s]  I don't know.
[13522.44s -> 13522.92s]  I can't tell.
[13523.88s -> 13525.08s]  That looks pretty flush.
[13525.72s -> 13526.12s]  We'll see.
[13526.76s -> 13528.93s]  No, they're bumping into the...
[13528.93s -> 13529.97s]  This is not going to work.
[13529.97s -> 13532.69s]  They're bumping into the lip here when they come up.
[13549.97s -> 13550.53s]  That's all right.
[13551.09s -> 13555.24s]  No, it's not going to work.
[13588.37s -> 13589.01s]  All right, fixed it.
[13589.57s -> 13609.86s]  Does it work?
[13609.86s -> 13617.83s]  I think so.
[13617.83s -> 13618.95s]  Now it's steeper than before,
[13618.95s -> 13620.79s]  but now at least they can cross it.
[13623.57s -> 13624.93s]  The beavers are dying.
[13624.93s -> 13631.51s]  Look, I just don't think...
[13631.51s -> 13632.95s]  I don't think they're smart enough to understand.
[13633.59s -> 13637.30s]  Well, this is actually a much better view of the exhibit.
[13637.30s -> 13638.26s]  Maybe this is a good idea.
[13638.98s -> 13639.94s]  You can see over the fence.
[13642.84s -> 13643.96s]  No, people are going up and down.
[13648.55s -> 13649.43s]  Rescue these people.
[13649.99s -> 13653.36s]  Just make it go into the enclosure,
[13654.16s -> 13656.29s]  but just drop off into the enclosure.
[13657.01s -> 13665.56s]  For the path around the whale sharks.
[13666.52s -> 13668.16s]  Look at how far that is, though.
[13668.16s -> 13670.16s]  I have to put that up here and then go around.
[13671.96s -> 13672.76s]  No one is...
[13672.76s -> 13673.72s]  No one's even coming over here.
[13674.28s -> 13676.28s]  Is this some educational thing?
[13676.28s -> 13676.68s]  Hold on.
[13677.40s -> 13687.60s]  Yeah, I need a donation machine as well.
[13688.48s -> 13694.48s]  Okay.
[13695.20s -> 13697.35s]  Then nobody cares that this exists.
[13704.68s -> 13705.32s]  Hold on.
[13705.32s -> 13706.04s]  I'll try it.
[13706.04s -> 13706.76s]  All right, fine.
[13707.32s -> 13713.80s]  This game's fun, though.
[13714.36s -> 13716.23s]  There's a fun game.
[13716.87s -> 13722.18s]  Connect the path to the ladder.
[13722.82s -> 13733.16s]  Is that really what was preventing people from going over here?
[13745.19s -> 13747.11s]  For a second, I thought this person's name was Quindelius.
[13757.56s -> 13767.19s]  Uh, a little angry.
[13767.19s -> 13771.36s]  He's waving to the sharks.
[13771.36s -> 13772.80s]  Is this guy just part of the exhibit now?
[13773.36s -> 13785.80s]  He's not even scared.
[13785.80s -> 13788.37s]  I'm gonna get a donation here.
[13789.56s -> 13791.43s]  Maybe.
[13791.43s -> 13793.54s]  He just pet the shark.
[13793.54s -> 13795.78s]  This is the crazy guy that comes to the aquarium.
[13795.78s -> 13796.72s]  He dives in.
[13798.52s -> 13799.88s]  He actually touched the shark.
[13799.88s -> 13800.36s]  He did it.
[13801.56s -> 13803.64s]  I can't see any animals from here.
[13803.64s -> 13812.82s]  He's just swimming.
[13812.82s -> 13814.74s]  This guy's a pretty damn good swimmer.
[13824.52s -> 13835.72s]  All right, well, let me come in there.
[13835.72s -> 13836.36s]  Can I dive?
[13844.21s -> 13845.17s]  It's kind of relaxing.
[13846.23s -> 13852.36s]  I'm kind of just relaxed.
[13852.36s -> 13854.36s]  Everybody else is feeling, like, relaxed right now.
[13854.92s -> 13863.49s]  He's like, whatever.
[13863.49s -> 13872.45s]  He did a T-pose.
[13872.45s -> 13873.81s]  He did not do a T-pose.
[13875.76s -> 13877.60s]  Well, it's about to get far less relaxing.
[13877.60s -> 13878.08s]  I'm sorry.
[13878.08s -> 13901.33s]  Are we gonna get a Jaws scenario?
[13901.97s -> 13902.53s]  It's possible.
[13913.44s -> 13920.26s]  Oh, my God.
[13920.26s -> 13921.38s]  He's okay.
[13921.38s -> 13923.60s]  He's not injured.
[13923.60s -> 13924.88s]  He's actually not injured.
[13924.88s -> 13925.68s]  He just doesn't even care.
[13925.68s -> 13926.88s]  He just puts his hands up.
[13927.44s -> 13928.48s]  Ah, whatever.
[13928.48s -> 13930.24s]  It's still kind of fun in here.
[13937.59s -> 13938.47s]  It picked him up.
[13939.03s -> 13939.67s]  In his mouth.
[13940.40s -> 13940.80s]  That's it.
[13941.44s -> 13944.16s]  And bit down really, really, really fucking hard.
[13951.62s -> 13952.58s]  He's yawning.
[13952.58s -> 13953.38s]  All right.
[13953.38s -> 13953.62s]  Good.
[13954.18s -> 13972.40s]  This is what Bill Crazy would do voluntarily.
[13972.40s -> 13972.96s]  Yeah.
[13972.96s -> 13979.46s]  Where is the whale shark?
[13979.46s -> 13981.81s]  Or any shark, for that matter.
[13993.70s -> 14003.67s]  Okay.
[14003.67s -> 14021.20s]  Let's see how you handle that now.
[14021.20s -> 14023.28s]  That is fucking terrifying.
[14023.28s -> 14026.02s]  My God.
[14026.02s -> 14028.52s]  Look below.
[14028.52s -> 14029.96s]  Oh, my goodness.
[14029.96s -> 14032.39s]  I wouldn't do this for a hundred million dollars.
[14033.11s -> 14043.30s]  The notifications are playing the Jaws theme.
[14044.60s -> 14052.87s]  What's this?
[14058.95s -> 14064.63s]  The notifications are playing the Jaws theme.
[14065.59s -> 14068.40s]  That's fucking so funny.
[14074.45s -> 14088.71s]  Um, I don't know what else.
[14088.71s -> 14089.51s]  I don't know how to do.
[14091.67s -> 14095.35s]  Where'd he go?
[14095.35s -> 14097.14s]  Where'd he go?
[14097.14s -> 14097.54s]  Where'd he go?
[14097.54s -> 14098.42s]  Where'd he go?
[14098.42s -> 14099.62s]  Did he get out?
[14100.18s -> 14119.40s]  Oh, fuck.
[14119.40s -> 14122.37s]  This might actually be bad for the computer.
[14122.37s -> 14122.61s]  No, no.
[14122.61s -> 14123.89s]  It should be bad for my computer.
[14124.77s -> 14126.95s]  How do I take care of this?
[14126.95s -> 14150.18s]  I don't know.
[14150.18s -> 14150.74s]  Coffins.
[14151.38s -> 14183.92s]  I'm trying to hold on.
[14183.92s -> 14185.52s]  Is this what I'm doing in the game right now?
[14187.88s -> 14188.84s]  It is, isn't it?
[14188.84s -> 14201.97s]  No, this is going to take so long.
[14202.61s -> 14204.85s]  I was about to write out each shit in their coffins.
[14206.48s -> 14207.76s]  No, just like, just sell them.
[14212.12s -> 14212.76s]  I can't sell.
[14212.76s -> 14213.64s]  That's not, that's it.
[14213.64s -> 14214.60s]  No, put it back in.
[14214.60s -> 14215.08s]  He's fine.
[14223.01s -> 14248.16s]  Uh, put him in the lake with the beavers.
[14248.16s -> 14265.36s]  I'm not going to show you that.
[14265.36s -> 14266.08s]  What have I done?
[14266.80s -> 14271.48s]  Well, did I save it somewhere before that fucking weirdo got in the water?
[14272.12s -> 14274.61s]  I got jumped through the water.
[14274.61s -> 14276.36s]  Like, what are you doing?
[14276.36s -> 14289.20s]  Fucking beaver scenario again.
[14289.20s -> 14296.64s]  All right, that's good.
[14296.64s -> 14303.32s]  Now the bridge is messed up again.
[14304.20s -> 14307.01s]  Well, then it's time.
[14308.71s -> 14313.19s]  Hold on.
[14313.19s -> 14315.94s]  Is there any, what are the animals I want to play around with?
[14315.94s -> 14318.32s]  Is there anything else I want to do?
[14321.28s -> 14323.92s]  I could just put penguins in until the game crashes.
[14324.48s -> 14327.96s]  Like until my computer physically like turns off.
[14336.66s -> 14337.06s]  All right.
[14337.06s -> 14345.40s]  Let's, uh, the penguins or, it needs to be small enough where I can put a lot of them.
[14346.04s -> 14349.65s]  And then put a t-rex right in the middle.
[14352.48s -> 14353.20s]  Yeah, I like that.
[14353.92s -> 14359.57s]  Yeah, let's get, let's get a new, let's get a clean slate here.
[14359.57s -> 14379.36s]  On a flat ground, a small in loves this music.
[14379.36s -> 14380.16s]  It's so great.
[14381.12s -> 14392.53s]  Sour pleased.
[14392.53s -> 14394.52s]  I've seen a lot of sour pleases.
[14396.31s -> 14396.63s]  All right.
[14396.63s -> 14400.77s]  Let's see if we can turn my computer into dust.
[14401.57s -> 14404.40s]  Let's flatten everything out.
[14405.04s -> 14406.96s]  I need a bigger brush size than that.
[14407.92s -> 14412.10s]  As big as it can be.
[14412.90s -> 14419.40s]  It's going to be one exhibit only.
[14420.12s -> 14433.52s]  We're not even going to get this far here.
[14434.32s -> 14435.96s]  Not that looks good.
[14437.96s -> 14440.12s]  So where is the penguin?
[14442.77s -> 14443.17s]  All right.
[14443.17s -> 14444.21s]  Rockhopper penguin.
[14444.21s -> 14444.77s]  How big are you?
[14445.49s -> 14446.95s]  Kind of small.
[14447.59s -> 14448.47s]  Uh, emperor penguin.
[14450.58s -> 14451.38s]  Start in the corner.
[14473.41s -> 14474.21s]  This is going to be bad.
[14475.41s -> 14477.25s]  This is going to stop in about five seconds.
[14479.17s -> 14486.87s]  I'm just creating the opening scene from Happy Feet.
[14515.76s -> 14518.55s]  How was my day?
[14518.55s -> 14519.03s]  It was good.
[14519.91s -> 14521.24s]  Just kind of relaxing.
[14521.24s -> 14524.20s]  Just having a chill day today.
[14538.40s -> 14539.52s]  They're not all dudes.
[14540.16s -> 14540.64s]  Look, see?
[14550.24s -> 14551.44s]  You want me to go faster than that?
[14554.21s -> 14560.04s]  Well, I can do it.
[14560.04s -> 14560.52s]  I can do it.
[14560.52s -> 14560.84s]  I can do it.
[14560.84s -> 14561.16s]  Hold on.
[14561.16s -> 14561.64s]  I can do it.
[14561.64s -> 14562.20s]  I can do it.
[14563.00s -> 14564.18s]  Nobody move.
[14577.43s -> 14577.99s]  Don't move.
[14589.92s -> 14590.72s]  No, they're moving.
[14591.52s -> 14603.99s]  This hurts already.
[14605.27s -> 14612.66s]  Eat salt.
[14613.62s -> 14614.82s]  No, not eat salt.
[14624.55s -> 14631.48s]  Let's get down to ground level.
[14632.12s -> 14644.08s]  This is fucking dumb.
[14644.08s -> 14646.00s]  I don't know why I thought this was going to be interesting.
[14647.94s -> 14649.14s]  And presents for everybody.
[14650.34s -> 14657.51s]  I was speaking of presents.
[14659.03s -> 14661.72s]  You, uh, Mr. Peanut.
[14663.96s -> 14668.31s]  On Christmas Eve, it's going to be a stream.
[14670.45s -> 14671.49s]  I don't think you're going to want to miss.
[14672.13s -> 14678.07s]  Christmas Eve is the day that the absolutely wonderful Christmas special will be.
[14683.94s -> 14684.82s]  Elf bowling.
[14684.82s -> 14685.30s]  What, what, what?
[14685.30s -> 14686.34s]  What did I do this for again?
[14687.14s -> 14692.32s]  Oh yeah, put like five tigers in.
[14697.32s -> 14701.32s]  Florida Panther in the middle of the tundra.
[14703.00s -> 14715.70s]  Florida in winter.
[14716.42s -> 14719.78s]  We'll lose enough.
[14721.32s -> 14722.84s]  What are those sounds?
[14723.64s -> 14724.76s]  That's a lion sound.
[14731.09s -> 14732.21s]  That doesn't sound like a lion.
[14732.85s -> 14734.05s]  No, that's the penguin.
[14734.77s -> 14736.37s]  Why are they going to the presents?
[14742.13s -> 14743.25s]  They don't care about the penguins.
[14743.25s -> 14744.69s]  They just want to open the presents.
[14757.52s -> 14762.72s]  Oh, he's inside of one.
[14765.32s -> 14767.41s]  It's a birthday party.
[14767.41s -> 14768.69s]  This did not go as planned.
[14769.25s -> 14769.73s]  Oh, well.
[14784.82s -> 14785.62s]  Oh my God.
[14786.58s -> 14791.60s]  My amazable play.
[14791.60s -> 14795.12s]  Well, I'm going to play that epic battle simulator.
[14795.12s -> 14796.80s]  Like that's what I'm trying to do right now.
[14797.44s -> 14816.87s]  Okay.
[14816.87s -> 14818.55s]  Let's see how angry that makes everybody.
[14819.35s -> 14824.24s]  What do they get to meet?
[14829.19s -> 14830.39s]  Just playing sport.
[14831.81s -> 14836.74s]  Have I really been in this game for four hours?
[14836.74s -> 14837.54s]  Holy shit.
[14838.42s -> 14848.82s]  I just groomed a fish.
[14859.28s -> 14860.00s]  All right.
[14860.00s -> 14861.12s]  I think we've peaked here.
[14861.92s -> 14871.38s]  It's time to open the zoo.
[14871.94s -> 14872.58s]  That's right.
[14873.60s -> 14874.64s]  Come on in, everybody.
[14875.60s -> 14876.96s]  What the fuck are they doing?
[14877.76s -> 14880.39s]  What are you doing over here?
[14896.72s -> 14897.28s]  Come on in.
[14897.28s -> 14898.48s]  It already is open.
[14898.48s -> 14900.96s]  People looking over the railing and going, no thanks.
[14901.92s -> 14906.00s]  Club Penguin.
[14908.84s -> 14910.28s]  Wait, whoa, he just dove in.
[14912.20s -> 14913.48s]  This guy just dove in here.
[14916.15s -> 14917.35s]  What is going on in the center?
[14917.99s -> 14932.18s]  All right.
[14932.18s -> 14932.66s]  Water bowl.
[14939.86s -> 14940.90s]  They're all stuck on each other.
[14940.90s -> 14941.38s]  They can't move.
[14947.97s -> 14949.09s]  Put a cage around them.
[14949.09s -> 14949.97s]  No, that's cruel.
[14956.66s -> 14957.38s]  This one's dead.
[14958.02s -> 14962.98s]  No, no one's eating anybody.
[14962.98s -> 14965.30s]  They're just sleeping and playing with presents
[14965.30s -> 14967.38s]  and having birthday parties and not doing anything else.
[14976.58s -> 14976.90s]  All right.
[14976.90s -> 14977.62s]  That's it for that.
[14984.55s -> 14985.43s]  Sell the fish.
[14989.00s -> 14996.45s]  Zoo Tycoon 1 has more murder.
[14999.73s -> 15000.61s]  More murder.
[15006.47s -> 15016.61s]  What time does the Red Dead beta start tomorrow?
[15016.61s -> 15017.65s]  Anybody know?
[15025.19s -> 15027.51s]  That's the end of the stream voice coming up here.
[15032.85s -> 15039.44s]  It's just out.
[15039.44s -> 15041.44s]  The end of the stream voice.
[15050.23s -> 15050.88s]  Let me see.
[15051.52s -> 15060.50s]  Boomer Streamer is tired at 8 PM.
[15060.50s -> 15061.86s]  No, no, that's not what it is.
[15068.90s -> 15070.34s]  What can I do for another hour or so?
[15070.90s -> 15074.05s]  Because I can't play Red Dead.
[15074.05s -> 15075.33s]  I want to do that tomorrow.
[15075.33s -> 15077.19s]  So Red Dead will be tomorrow.
[15078.52s -> 15081.19s]  And then Friday.
[15084.63s -> 15087.51s]  Oh, yeah, I think I might do Dreamcast on Friday.
[15088.31s -> 15089.11s]  I might pull it out.
[15101.08s -> 15101.56s]  Red Dead.
[15101.56s -> 15103.32s]  Yeah, you know, I could play single player in Red Dead
[15103.32s -> 15104.20s]  to prepare for tomorrow.
[15105.00s -> 15107.80s]  But I don't know.
[15108.52s -> 15109.16s]  Hey, let me do this.
[15109.16s -> 15109.48s]  Let me grab.
[15109.48s -> 15110.36s]  I'm going to let me.
[15110.36s -> 15112.36s]  It's been like four and a half hours almost.
[15112.36s -> 15115.14s]  Let me grab a water and I'll be right back.
[15116.23s -> 15117.83s]  And we can figure out what the hell we're going to do.
[15118.47s -> 15121.00s]  See you in a second.
