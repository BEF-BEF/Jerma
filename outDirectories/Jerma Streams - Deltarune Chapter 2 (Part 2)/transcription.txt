[1.53s -> 7.66s]  Damn, I lost track of time. I just did. That's a fact. There's no sound. Oh shit, hold on.
[7.66s -> 17.19s]  There we go. Yeah, I lost track of time. I just kind of blinked, and it was like,
[17.75s -> 26.38s]  two. I was like, what the hell happened? Content creator. That's right. I don't have to say
[26.38s -> 37.99s]  anything. I'm a content creator. I don't have to say anything. I also want to ask you guys
[37.99s -> 44.57s]  something, because I don't know if this was a dream I had last night, or if this was a thing
[44.57s -> 53.38s]  I told you guys yesterday. I don't remember. I have to ask you. So at some point yesterday,
[53.38s -> 60.74s]  it was either a dream last night or last night near the end of the stream. I was humming a song.
[61.46s -> 71.19s]  I was going like, I was doing like, you know, the thing that I do. I'm just humming a song with
[71.19s -> 76.33s]  like a high pitched sound, right? And I stopped halfway through and I said, I went like this,
[76.33s -> 84.17s]  I went like, I just freaked out. I said, I'm fucking Peter Griffin with a different noise.
[86.17s -> 90.89s]  That happened yesterday? Or did I dream that that happened yesterday? I had a dream that that
[90.89s -> 105.38s]  happened. That did not happen. I had, okay, so apparently I had a dream last night where I
[105.38s -> 112.23s]  was sitting here doing that. And I freaked out and I said, I'm Peter Griffin with a different noise.
[112.23s -> 127.34s]  What the fuck? And there was way more shit that happened in that dream too. Was it during Bone?
[128.06s -> 132.62s]  Was it during Boneworks? Wait, did that happen during, that happened on another stream?
[133.26s -> 144.65s]  Did that happen on a different fucking broadcast? No, it didn't. It did. Okay, well, it happened.
[145.45s -> 153.64s]  Hey, thank you a little bit later for the damn guy Peter to yourself. You've done that 40 times.
[154.60s -> 159.08s]  Is that, what else? I must be so scared of being connected to like family guy that I have
[159.08s -> 167.93s]  nightmares about it now. Remember, were you tripping? No, I've refused to trip. I'm never
[167.93s -> 181.56s]  going to do it. It'll never happen. I don't, I can't, I don't want to do that stuff. Nightmare.
[185.16s -> 189.40s]  Anyways, let's talk about today because we're going to, we're doing a little schedule pivot
[189.40s -> 196.95s]  change today. Pivot change. We're going to finish Undertale. But you know what I mean.
[197.59s -> 205.08s]  We're going to finish Deltarune. And then after that, we are not going to play Umbrellas
[205.72s -> 213.99s]  not allowed anymore. We're going to move from here to the tip of the hat stream. So we will
[213.99s -> 218.07s]  raid the tip of the hat stream and I'm going to go over there and participate for like an hour or so.
[218.79s -> 223.34s]  I play a game or something. I just hang out. So we're going to go from here to tip of the hats
[225.22s -> 238.23s]  later. This is Deltarune. Yes, this is not Undertale. I need to tweet this. So let's go
[238.23s -> 272.81s]  ahead and tweet Andy. Be right back. While I write this, somebody said, are you going to stream the
[272.81s -> 278.70s]  Diablo 2 remake? The answer is no. And I'll give you a very specific couple of reasons why.
[280.89s -> 288.30s]  If I ever really sit down and play the Diablo 2 remake on stream, I feel like, and I'm this,
[288.30s -> 293.10s]  this is not, this is nothing against you guys. This is nothing against streaming or YouTube.
[294.58s -> 303.72s]  That's a me thing. I don't, I don't really want to stream that. It's a me thing. If I'm going to do
[303.72s -> 310.92s]  that because I don't really want to turn it into like a thing that I'm streaming and just kind of
[310.92s -> 317.88s]  turn it on. Cause I wanted to be able to sit, sit in this chair with my mouth open, just staring
[317.88s -> 321.40s]  and just not even say a word and just fucking just walk around and pick up uniques and stuff.
[322.36s -> 327.75s]  Oh, it is nothing against this community, the stream, nothing. I just, I'm not going to stream
[327.75s -> 336.70s]  that if I'm going to play it. Diablo 2 is great, but Diablo 2 is also a lot of just kind of,
[336.78s -> 341.18s]  Oh my God, we got, we, we got, we got 15 community subs from no seven. Thank you.
[343.32s -> 348.12s]  Once you get through the first few acts of Diablo 2 and you, you know, if you beat the game,
[348.12s -> 351.08s]  you go through a nightmare, you beat the game, you go through it. It's a lot of just like,
[351.64s -> 357.80s]  I let's get the cube. Okay. Get the amulet. You get the way point. Yep. Okay. Go, go. All right.
[357.80s -> 362.20s]  Nice. Like, hold on. I gotta put a point in. All right. Put the make cube. Let's go. Dario go.
[362.92s -> 367.34s]  All right. Act three, you get the way point. Yep. It's, it's literally just kind of, you just go
[367.34s -> 373.40s]  through the motions like 10 times to get like a pretty colored item. That's what we want.
[374.12s -> 384.17s]  It's a good just chatting game. Yeah. Okay. Oh, here, here. Listen, if I ever get to a point
[384.17s -> 389.69s]  where I have like a level, like 70 sorceress or something, if I'm like playing the fuck out
[389.69s -> 393.61s]  of that game and I want to just do like a stream where I'm just sitting here doing like Mephisto
[393.61s -> 397.77s]  runs while we just talk and yeah, you'll see it, but I'm not going to start like a level
[397.85s -> 405.32s]  zero barbarian in the remake and stream that, right? That's the thing I'd want to do on my own.
[407.67s -> 412.97s]  Oh, here comes, here comes the chimpanzees. All right. Let me finish my tweet. You guys are
[412.97s -> 425.32s]  distracting me. That's why I was so late today. You should play Deltarune chapter two. I agree.
[425.32s -> 450.97s]  So let's get started. Let me just tweet this. Anybody else only type with their dominant hands
[450.97s -> 459.32s]  thumb on their phone's keyboard? I hold. So I'm right-handed. So I hold the phone in my left hand
[460.22s -> 465.82s]  with my thumb up. And so I'm like holding it, um, kind of like palming it in a way. My, all my
[465.82s -> 471.74s]  fingers are kind of around the edges of the other side. And then I cup the first hand that my left
[471.74s -> 478.62s]  hand is holding it with the right hand. And then I use the sole right thumb to type everything.
[479.26s -> 486.36s]  That weird to use both thumbs. I don't do that. That's not a boomer hold. Excuse me. The boomer
[486.36s -> 493.96s]  hold is hold with left-hand palm index finger on other dominant hand is poking while it's very
[493.96s -> 499.96s]  close to your face. Excuse me. I'm not going to be put in that category. I'm a millennial.
[506.22s -> 517.50s]  Did I even press the tweet button? All right. I'm ready. You guys ready? Here we go. This is
[517.50s -> 532.95s]  what we left off. Turn it up. It's way faster to use both hands. Yeah, but I, okay. Here's my problem
[532.95s -> 540.31s]  with that. The keyboard is so tiny that if I use both hands and fingers or whatever, I press like
[540.31s -> 559.19s]  eight different letters. Loud. Not too loud. All right. Here we go. So the last thing that happened
[559.19s -> 568.65s]  was a sand showed up and threw fucking lightning bolts out of the sky. And if we had to like dodge
[568.65s -> 575.78s]  them and shit, it was crazy. And one of them hits, uh, one of them hits Susie and Susie's now currently,
[576.50s -> 582.92s]  um, like dying, I think in the other room, which is like crazy. I hit Susie. It hit me and it hit,
[582.92s -> 594.63s]  um, it was, that's the last thing to happen is from crazy. I'm going to head out. Uh, what it's
[594.63s -> 601.54s]  too loud. No, it's not. This is softer than it was yesterday. Please apologize for timing me up for
[601.54s -> 606.58s]  10 minutes. All right. So the pre-stream chat, I timed somebody over 10 minutes, but hold on. Yes.
[606.58s -> 610.50s]  I apologize for timing you out for 10 minutes in pre-stream, but let's talk about the context first.
[611.14s -> 617.22s]  You asked me to play destiny to PVP tomorrow. Do you think that is, is that a, should I have
[617.22s -> 626.92s]  timed you up for an hour or is that, was 10 minutes, um, warranted? I'm sorry for time. I didn't,
[626.92s -> 631.38s]  I was trying to do it for like a minute. I'm sorry. That's a permanent man. All right. I'm ready.
[631.38s -> 641.98s]  Let's go. I'm ready to play. I keep almost saying undertale. So quick recap. Um, Lancer is sick.
[642.54s -> 647.98s]  He's ill. He saved us. He was in our pocket for like a day or two. He came out. He let us all out.
[647.98s -> 652.78s]  We were captured by the queen and now he's kind of sick. He's like cold and he can't walk and stuff.
[652.78s -> 658.95s]  So this is kind of, this is, um, it's getting a little weird. All right. Think you can do it,
[658.95s -> 663.86s]  Chris? Of course I can. I can do puzzles. Calm your skinless boneless thighs. Everybody.
[666.52s -> 670.68s]  I'll think of a solution. I gotta get my voices going. I gotta get my voices going.
[671.16s -> 678.33s]  It's just ignore him. I'll just be over here where I can't hear you and I'll be here away
[678.33s -> 683.26s]  from your IQ debuffing aura. There we go. That's better. All right. So we're,
[686.52s -> 701.30s]  move. Oh, I see. It's one of these puzzles. Oh, I can rotate it. We go. We go. We go.
[701.30s -> 719.99s]  We go. We go. Is that supposed to do that? Yeah, we got it. What? Hey, wait a second. How did you,
[719.99s -> 731.02s]  how'd you solve it without me? First figured it out before you jealous. Well, I knew the answer.
[731.02s -> 738.04s]  I just wanted to see Chris try first. By the way, if anyone can tell me what that, what that laugh
[738.04s -> 752.58s]  was, you get 10, uh, community thumbs up points. What was that? It was not Gannon. Nope. Laugh.
[752.58s -> 761.34s]  Nope. Nope. Not Zelda. Wrong. Somebody got to say it. Did somebody say it? I think I saw it.
[761.34s -> 766.97s]  I want to be confirmed that more than one person knew what it was. Not Street Fighter,
[766.97s -> 776.17s]  not punch out. Do it again. Hup, hup, hup, hup. Hup, hup, hup, hup. I'll tell you, it's from, uh,
[776.17s -> 780.95s]  it's from a group of turtles. I just, it's a Ninja turtle there. I fucking just ruined it.
[780.95s -> 785.64s]  That's Shredder from Turtles in Time when he jumps into the screen and he like,
[785.64s -> 796.46s]  puts you back in time. Oh, you got it wrong. Sorry. Uh, it's called Suspense Susan. Dramatic
[796.46s -> 807.43s]  suspense. Nobody cares. I do. That's bullshit. Go watch, go look at it then. If I'm so wrong then.
[809.53s -> 824.10s]  And you do the next one. Fine. Watch me. Also, my name's not Susan. Oh shit, these are going to get
[824.10s -> 831.42s]  harder. Child's play. Wouldn't you give me a harder one? For example, if anyone had a four by four
[831.42s -> 845.30s]  puzzle to you. Just tell us the solution. Well, you see, first you align the shadows with the
[845.30s -> 854.73s]  lines on the floor. All right, what do we move first? Um, let's just do the puzzle. Just give
[854.73s -> 862.58s]  me a moment. It's not like Chris could even solve it anyway. Oh, this is actually, this might take
[862.58s -> 881.34s]  a little while. Well, maybe not. Let's see how smart I am. Turns out I know what I'm doing.
[881.34s -> 900.18s]  Okay, I just want to go pick this up off the ground. Oh, no, I don't. Oops. Everybody,
[900.18s -> 913.24s]  everybody thinks they're so smart until they're not. Right. Oh shit. This is going to, I don't,
[913.24s -> 925.85s]  I need to, I feel like I had it. Correct. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[925.85s -> 935.51s]  I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Everyone stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop. No, it doesn't go
[935.51s -> 963.32s]  flat. Oh my God. No, stop, stop. Everyone quiet. No, wrong one. Idiot. Fuck. This doesn't, no,
[963.32s -> 987.80s]  none of them go flat. Shit. I don't know. I thought I had it. How do I do this? Wait, fuck.
[987.80s -> 1001.78s]  Are you trolling? No, I'm not. It's just weird. Did I have it right the first time? I'm actually
[1001.78s -> 1014.25s]  blown away by this time. Everybody else says I'm bad. Oh my God. I'm absolutely blown away by this.
[1015.21s -> 1032.44s]  I can't believe I'm blown away. So like, this is making me like so mad. I got it. What the fuck?
[1033.08s -> 1063.32s]  Shit. Hey. Dude, I'm fucking blown away by this. It is funny when he cannot solve the puzzle. Omega
[1063.32s -> 1069.59s]  lull. Is this the future of like Twitch chat? It's going to be like androids. It is quite
[1069.59s -> 1079.11s]  humorous when he cannot solve the children's puzzle. You can't have. You just got lucky.
[1079.11s -> 1089.02s]  It's just trial and error. Kind of was for me. It was for me. I just looked up shredder laughing
[1089.02s -> 1096.78s]  and it sounds nothing like that. All right. Well, it's time for me to fucking. All right,
[1096.78s -> 1108.34s]  fine. I can't believe I actually have to do this. I can't fucking believe I have to do this.
[1108.34s -> 1132.25s]  So here it is. Let me just go like this. Not there. Where is it? It's when he comes out of the screen.
[1134.65s -> 1137.85s]  This is not a joke alert. This is literally I'm waiting for him to do the ha ha ha thing.
[1138.49s -> 1142.81s]  There it is. So you beat shredder, throw a bunch of people into his screen.
[1148.81s -> 1150.73s]  And what did that what happened?
[1163.06s -> 1179.46s]  And I was, I was the wrong one apparently. Remember that guy is.
[1180.90s -> 1189.74s]  Let's go. Brute force method. Arcade man could do it. Except cavemen died out because they're
[1189.74s -> 1198.98s]  stupid. I'm solving the next one. So just stay here until I'm done. Yeah, like we're going to
[1198.98s -> 1208.65s]  wait that long. Am I at the end of the game? Um, I believe I am fairly close to being at the last
[1208.65s -> 1215.37s]  portion of the game. What are you two doing here? This one's mine. It'll be over in a second. So why
[1215.37s -> 1223.29s]  don't you just relax in your mind palace? Which probably doesn't even have anything in it. I just
[1223.29s -> 1234.68s]  need to figure out why the shapes don't go together. Oh, hey, you just got to fill the whole square
[1234.68s -> 1242.70s]  thing, right? What if you just piled them all in the corners? Like digging a really wide hole.
[1243.42s -> 1254.30s]  What? First want to try? Oh, what? Oh, no. I don't like this. In the corner? Put them all in the
[1254.30s -> 1259.02s]  corner? I don't know. This is not gonna fit though. What do you mean put them in the corner?
[1259.82s -> 1300.87s]  Just like, stop them in the corner? Can I do that? Does that work? What? Dude, different corners.
[1302.94s -> 1309.56s]  What are you talking about? They have to go in different corners? I thought it was just like,
[1309.56s -> 1327.96s]  just put them in there. Who cares? Isn't that correct? Well, I thought it was just to stick
[1327.96s -> 1335.18s]  everything in the corner. I thought that's what it was. That's not, he's actually zonked. I'm not.
[1335.18s -> 1343.53s]  I'm fine. I just woke up like 15 minutes ago. I'm fine. Okay. I did not. I woke up at like,
[1343.53s -> 1347.69s]  I woke up well into the morning, I promise. I didn't just wake up.
[1352.66s -> 1358.26s]  All right, Susie. I did the work. There's no way. It's a computer bug. It's a glitch.
[1358.98s -> 1362.02s]  You're cheating. Just like when you wave dashed.
[1365.86s -> 1372.50s]  How is it taste, idiot? Man, I'm gonna relish this forever. All those times you acted so high and
[1372.50s -> 1380.10s]  mighty. Oh, guess what? You're not. Face it. You're just a big dumbass. Just like the rest of us.
[1384.01s -> 1397.85s]  Oh, we're kind of sad. Fine. I admit it. I'm not that smart. I never was.
[1399.21s -> 1405.70s]  There. Are you happy? I just used to be a forgettable little blue bird.
[1406.58s -> 1413.42s]  No one even remembered my name. Then one day came the spelling bee Noel and I studied for.
[1414.06s -> 1419.88s]  And it came down to the two of us. She got nervous and couldn't speak.
[1420.68s -> 1437.13s]  We lost. And I won. That was when I tasted it. Praise the glory, the superiority, the addictive
[1437.13s -> 1444.55s]  power of being smart. Since then, year after year, I've been number one in the class. It was only
[1444.55s -> 1452.63s]  because Noel helped me study. He's the real smart kid. Everyone's expectations for me are so high
[1452.63s -> 1463.74s]  now. What am I going to do once I go somewhere without her? Why I wanted to make a new world
[1463.74s -> 1474.09s]  for us. A world where we'll always be number one and number two. But I'm still wrapped up in that.
[1474.09s -> 1481.85s]  I got tricked by the queen. Now Noel is going to suffer because of it. Maybe I did just like
[1481.85s -> 1492.94s]  being superior. Maybe I am just an idiot. Don't cry, chicken nugget man. All of us are idiots too.
[1492.94s -> 1499.50s]  Huh? I mean, like, I don't know about everyone else, but whether you're the smart kid or not,
[1500.06s -> 1507.10s]  we couldn't care less. Screw up as much as you want, honestly. Not like our opinion of you could.
[1507.10s -> 1511.13s]  Susie! Susie, you'd accept me even if I'm dumb?
[1512.81s -> 1517.75s]  Uh, yeah. Like when your sister gets cursed in Dragon Blazers 2.
[1518.95s -> 1530.26s]  Even if her stats suck, she's still your party member. Susie, real Dragon Blazers 2 reference?
[1531.80s -> 1538.73s]  Susie, you're not only kind, but a true gamer as well. Perhaps I underestimated you.
[1539.05s -> 1540.55s]  Uh, uh, uh.
[1540.55s -> 1543.29s]  Worry not. I have decided. Uh, uh, uh.
[1543.29s -> 1546.33s]  I will turn over a new leaf from now on. Uh, uh, uh.
[1546.33s -> 1549.29s]  And fight for the side of ignorance.
[1551.26s -> 1555.99s]  We're not telling you to be stupid. Yes, sometimes it's okay to make mistakes.
[1558.26s -> 1560.34s]  And make mistakes I will. Uh.
[1560.34s -> 1560.84s]  Onward!
[1562.90s -> 1569.29s]  Why couldn't Rousey be here to teach the normal lesson? He's a gamer.
[1569.77s -> 1588.66s]  This downstairs table will be for our special guests.
[1588.66s -> 1594.98s]  There's a dinner party on the second floor for everyone else.
[1594.98s -> 1596.98s]  Everything here is tailored for you, right?
[1604.57s -> 1606.25s]  That's screaming. That's Rousey.
[1608.78s -> 1610.54s]  Um, you don't have to scream.
[1612.18s -> 1613.62s]  Just because you like my outfit.
[1615.78s -> 1616.50s]  Oh my god.
[1617.94s -> 1623.19s]  I need to take a- I need to take at least a minute for that one.
[1631.03s -> 1632.71s]  Okay.
[1632.71s -> 1635.67s]  Oh, Chris. Susie. Uh, how may I serve you?
[1636.55s -> 1637.75s]  What the hell are you doing?
[1638.71s -> 1644.39s]  Um, the queen didn't have a room for me so, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, uh.
[1644.39s -> 1646.39s]  She made me into one of her butlers instead.
[1648.60s -> 1650.76s]  Whatever, Rousey. Can you heal Lancer?
[1650.76s -> 1655.37s]  Come on. Give me that one.
[1656.90s -> 1660.06s]  Oh. It's cold.
[1663.83s -> 1664.23s]  Susie.
[1666.92s -> 1668.76s]  I'm afraid this is something I can't heal.
[1670.20s -> 1670.70s]  What?
[1671.72s -> 1672.44s]  Lancer is-
[1676.47s -> 1677.27s]  Lancer? Hey!
[1678.63s -> 1681.35s]  You see, each dark fountain creates a different world.
[1682.31s -> 1686.15s]  A world whose darkness reflect the will of its fountain.
[1686.15s -> 1688.55s]  Can I do that one again?
[1688.55s -> 1689.43s]  Can we do that one again?
[1690.15s -> 1690.79s]  I messed it up.
[1693.85s -> 1697.21s]  A world whose darkners reflect the will of its fountain.
[1698.57s -> 1701.85s]  But through those darkners can exist in their own worlds.
[1705.06s -> 1707.30s]  They might not belong if they go to another one.
[1712.18s -> 1713.72s]  So can we help him?
[1719.21s -> 1720.73s]  Yes, there is a way.
[1721.69s -> 1724.17s]  Castletown's Grand Fountain is made of pure darkness.
[1724.97s -> 1727.77s]  As long as it stays flowing, any darkner can live there.
[1729.78s -> 1733.22s]  So if we bring Lancer back to school, he'll be okay again.
[1739.91s -> 1741.19s]  He thinks he's a voice actor.
[1743.24s -> 1745.67s]  So we just need to get out of here, huh?
[1745.67s -> 1746.17s]  Right.
[1747.59s -> 1748.09s]  Alright.
[1748.95s -> 1750.47s]  Lancer, we'll be back for you, buddy.
[1751.40s -> 1753.24s]  We can't jump between dark worlds.
[1755.58s -> 1759.40s]  Your friend, if we defeat Queen, we can save him.
[1761.46s -> 1767.54s]  Yeah, with me out of the way, Queen is going to force Noelle to do her bidding.
[1767.54s -> 1773.54s]  And if Noelle doesn't want to, she might make her face into a robot one.
[1773.54s -> 1779.21s]  Seriously.
[1780.63s -> 1782.71s]  Would you assist me in saving Noelle?
[1786.78s -> 1790.33s]  Me? I just can't do it by myself.
[1791.90s -> 1793.66s]  But if you can help me, I have a plan.
[1795.02s -> 1795.52s]  A plan?
[1796.30s -> 1798.14s]  I remember from Queen's tour of this place.
[1798.78s -> 1800.78s]  It's a secret shortcut on the third floor.
[1801.34s -> 1806.55s]  While Chris is distracting Queen, Susie will take the shortcut to reach Noelle
[1806.55s -> 1809.54s]  and transfer her to me on the roof.
[1810.34s -> 1813.62s]  From there, I'll bring her to a safe hiding spot.
[1814.66s -> 1816.50s]  And together we can all defeat the Queen!
[1819.53s -> 1820.73s]  Alright, sure, we'll give it a shot.
[1822.71s -> 1823.75s]  Most excellent said.
[1826.58s -> 1828.02s]  See you on the roof, fellow agent.
[1833.06s -> 1833.78s]  Alright, let's go.
[1837.19s -> 1838.39s]  Did you take that off already?
[1839.67s -> 1840.17s]  Sorry.
[1841.27s -> 1844.62s]  That's like sad.
[1845.18s -> 1846.57s]  We're just gonna leave him here?
[1847.29s -> 1847.79s]  Whoa.
[1848.65s -> 1849.15s]  Whoa, wait.
[1850.17s -> 1852.76s]  Is this like an Easter egg?
[1852.76s -> 1853.72s]  What if I move him all the way?
[1866.60s -> 1867.16s]  What?
[1867.16s -> 1869.66s]  He seems to be well taken care of.
[1870.38s -> 1874.42s]  Is this spaghetti?
[1875.06s -> 1876.79s]  Is that spaghetti?
[1890.42s -> 1891.22s]  Oh shit, this is just...
[1891.22s -> 1891.72s]  Okay.
[1893.91s -> 1894.41s]  Wait, what?
[1894.95s -> 1896.47s]  We're gonna have these legs?
[1896.47s -> 1898.82s]  It's a pair of legs.
[1904.57s -> 1906.81s]  I think that's like bathrooms on fire.
[1910.65s -> 1911.21s]  It's a door.
[1911.45s -> 1912.25s]  Where will you go?
[1913.80s -> 1914.68s]  Oh, fuck.
[1914.68s -> 1920.58s]  Okay, hold on.
[1920.58s -> 1922.02s]  It's a cyber thing.
[1922.02s -> 1923.94s]  There's a book here about shortcuts that open up later.
[1924.66s -> 1926.97s]  The Cybernetic Bookshelf.
[1933.27s -> 1934.79s]  Welcome to Collar Cafe.
[1934.79s -> 1935.83s]  Let us warm your day.
[1937.78s -> 1938.58s]  Talk about yourself.
[1939.51s -> 1942.47s]  Ah, forgive me for not introducing myself sooner, young masters.
[1943.19s -> 1945.67s]  I am Swatch, our Lady Grace's head butler.
[1946.49s -> 1948.41s]  When we are not attending to her needs,
[1948.41s -> 1949.69s]  I and the Queen's other style,
[1950.33s -> 1953.53s]  use this room as our humble yet colorful gift shop slash cafe.
[1954.17s -> 1956.41s]  Please shop to your heart's content.
[1956.41s -> 1958.17s]  We are eager to serve your any dish.
[1961.43s -> 1964.55s]  Does a woman of Our Lady Grace's caliber not deserve
[1964.55s -> 1967.75s]  a coven of powerful men and women to dote upon her every movement?
[1969.00s -> 1971.48s]  Have rap anthems written to her kindness?
[1972.28s -> 1976.89s]  Which are then bit crushed beyond recognition to make them more computer?
[1977.69s -> 1981.66s]  To have melons smashed with karate chops repeatedly for no apparent reason?
[1982.46s -> 1985.22s]  To have barrels thrown from the rafters?
[1986.20s -> 1989.00s]  Make us smash them all with karate chops before the timer runs out?
[1989.72s -> 1992.89s]  The barrels are full of melons and we have to smash those too?
[1993.86s -> 1995.94s]  Yes, the answer is yes.
[1996.74s -> 2004.82s]  Rooksholtz, I'm afraid I am not familiar with a guest of that moniker.
[2005.82s -> 2008.78s]  Ah wait, are you by chance referring to that unbearable,
[2008.78s -> 2013.02s]  unique man who barged in here and demanded to be made butler supremeth?
[2013.58s -> 2016.46s]  I'm afraid that that person is now banned from this establishment.
[2017.18s -> 2019.53s]  May have suffered injuries as a result of his,
[2019.53s -> 2021.77s]  uh, rather swift ejection.
[2022.65s -> 2023.85s]  Please do not mention him again.
[2024.57s -> 2027.34s]  You're still cleaning up the worms he left on the floor.
[2029.45s -> 2029.95s]  Outfit.
[2030.49s -> 2031.50s]  Ah, my outfit.
[2031.50s -> 2033.50s]  Yes, the monochrome look is quite suitable, isn't it?
[2034.57s -> 2036.01s]  Black suit, colored glasses.
[2036.01s -> 2038.25s]  Many people have failed to imitate this look.
[2038.97s -> 2042.14s]  So I'm even going so far as to attempt to impersonate me.
[2042.14s -> 2045.35s]  I'm going to get the, uh, nevermind.
[2045.35s -> 2046.07s]  Back around?
[2046.07s -> 2050.31s]  It's rules.
[2050.31s -> 2051.43s]  No, it's Rooksholtz!
[2052.07s -> 2056.38s]  It's Roxas!
[2056.38s -> 2056.88s]  Yes.
[2066.82s -> 2067.78s]  It's the Peter Griffin thing again.
[2067.78s -> 2073.98s]  I'm out.
[2073.98s -> 2074.70s]  Butt juice.
[2075.90s -> 2076.62s]  Oh god.
[2080.49s -> 2083.21s]  Uh, 100 HP for butt juice.
[2083.21s -> 2084.25s]  What about the spaghetti code?
[2085.51s -> 2086.31s]  You're insane.
[2089.16s -> 2093.35s]  Not.
[2093.35s -> 2094.55s]  30 HP?
[2094.55s -> 2095.83s]  Why is this $180?
[2099.66s -> 2100.94s]  B-shot bow tie.
[2100.94s -> 2101.44s]  Ooh.
[2103.10s -> 2103.98s]  Royal pin.
[2103.98s -> 2104.48s]  Ooh.
[2107.75s -> 2109.03s]  Oh, it's a everybody heel.
[2109.03s -> 2109.75s]  Okay.
[2109.75s -> 2111.83s]  It's a party heel.
[2111.83s -> 2113.34s]  Oh, it is, it says party.
[2114.06s -> 2118.86s]  I'm going to get a bow tie?
[2118.86s -> 2119.98s]  Or should I get the royal pin?
[2120.62s -> 2122.52s]  All right, I'm getting the royal pin.
[2122.52s -> 2123.72s]  It's probably, is this expensive?
[2124.68s -> 2126.95s]  That's two armor.
[2127.51s -> 2132.01s]  I'm going to hold on to it.
[2132.01s -> 2135.93s]  Can I sell, sell weapons?
[2135.93s -> 2136.33s]  No.
[2136.33s -> 2136.89s]  Sell armor?
[2137.61s -> 2139.29s]  Oh wait, I can sell the stupid mannequin.
[2140.01s -> 2144.10s]  Should I keep the mannequin for like crafting or something?
[2144.90s -> 2145.94s]  Should I never sell anything?
[2147.18s -> 2147.68s]  Whoa.
[2149.05s -> 2149.77s]  Dog dollar.
[2150.33s -> 2154.54s]  Should I sell the dog dollar?
[2154.54s -> 2160.81s]  Oh, hold.
[2160.81s -> 2163.74s]  All right, that's, that's enough.
[2166.90s -> 2167.40s]  Hold.
[2167.94s -> 2176.44s]  Okay, I want to go visit, yeah.
[2176.44s -> 2177.56s]  I want to go visit the trash guy.
[2178.20s -> 2180.30s]  Trash zone.
[2180.86s -> 2187.26s]  It's an eggplant that looks like a trash bag.
[2187.90s -> 2191.88s]  Funny little guy was looking for you to the west.
[2193.10s -> 2194.86s]  He was muttering something about deals.
[2195.58s -> 2197.42s]  I know what that way is.
[2198.14s -> 2212.87s]  Door is unlocked.
[2213.43s -> 2217.90s]  I'm going in.
[2219.77s -> 2221.21s]  What, you want to go in by yourself?
[2222.01s -> 2223.13s]  Whatever, do what you want.
[2223.93s -> 2227.82s]  Hey, hey, hey.
[2227.82s -> 2228.86s]  It's me, Spamton G.
[2229.50s -> 2230.00s]  Spamton.
[2232.79s -> 2234.02s]  Let's make a deal.
[2236.90s -> 2237.86s]  Okay, about you.
[2238.82s -> 2240.90s]  I used to be not a robot email guy.
[2240.90s -> 2242.74s]  And now I'm the, ow.
[2242.74s -> 2244.10s]  It burns, help me, ow.
[2244.10s -> 2245.14s]  I'm the, it burns guy.
[2246.10s -> 2248.25s]  Amazed at this amazing transformation,
[2248.25s -> 2249.93s]  you too can have a communion.
[2249.93s -> 2252.01s]  Where, with, ha ha.
[2252.01s -> 2255.48s]  Soon I'll even surpass that damned clown.
[2255.48s -> 2257.08s]  Clown around town, a clown in the town.
[2257.08s -> 2260.12s]  But unlike him, I'm going to shoot for the sky.
[2260.92s -> 2262.84s]  Get down the path, you, the big one.
[2263.56s -> 2266.18s]  I'll get so, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll get so,
[2266.18s -> 2267.70s]  I'll get, I'll get, ow.
[2268.66s -> 2274.15s]  Speaking of communion.
[2274.15s -> 2277.10s]  Chris, did you know that there's a knight?
[2277.10s -> 2278.54s]  No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[2278.54s -> 2279.26s]  I didn't mean to.
[2280.14s -> 2281.82s]  Too many excess vacation days
[2281.82s -> 2288.90s]  take a goddamn vacation straight to hell.
[2288.90s -> 2289.40s]  Friends?
[2291.19s -> 2291.69s]  Me?
[2292.97s -> 2293.47s]  Friends?
[2296.01s -> 2296.89s]  Chris, you and me,
[2296.89s -> 2298.65s]  our already friend request has been accepted.
[2299.53s -> 2300.81s]  We don't need anyone else.
[2300.81s -> 2303.53s]  We don't need easels or CRTs.
[2304.81s -> 2307.29s]  We don't need any man, woman, or child at half price.
[2307.93s -> 2309.13s]  We don't need Mike.
[2311.13s -> 2311.63s]  Mike.
[2313.19s -> 2313.91s]  Chris!
[2313.99s -> 2315.35s]  Don't believe anything you see on TV.
[2315.35s -> 2316.55s]  The man's a criminal, I tell you.
[2316.55s -> 2317.05s]  A criminal.
[2317.75s -> 2327.38s]  Do it again?
[2327.38s -> 2335.32s]  Okay, what about our deal?
[2337.03s -> 2339.19s]  Chris, you little sponge.
[2339.19s -> 2341.03s]  I knew you'd come here on a Saturday night.
[2341.91s -> 2343.35s]  After all, you want to be a big shot.
[2346.33s -> 2346.97s]  But how?
[2346.97s -> 2347.77s]  How can you be?
[2348.41s -> 2350.17s]  Listen, listen, listen to me.
[2350.17s -> 2351.77s]  Get in, get over here.
[2351.77s -> 2353.77s]  In the deep abyss of Queen's Mansion.
[2354.73s -> 2356.65s]  A great deal is waiting for a limited time.
[2356.65s -> 2358.01s]  No, well, only a limited time.
[2358.01s -> 2359.61s]  Only a heaven-piercing, work-out-ready body.
[2360.41s -> 2361.69s]  Signed by the classics.
[2361.69s -> 2363.93s]  You've come to expect our latest of 1997 copyright.
[2363.93s -> 2364.81s]  We gotta make sure we put that there.
[2365.77s -> 2368.01s]  Chris, that little nipper is
[2368.01s -> 2370.89s]  our one-way ticket to make you big.
[2370.89s -> 2371.85s]  Make it me big.
[2372.95s -> 2373.83s]  Before you know it,
[2373.83s -> 2375.35s]  we will be taking a ride around town
[2375.35s -> 2377.59s]  in our special conga-dero.
[2380.76s -> 2382.36s]  Vacationing in burning acid
[2382.36s -> 2383.48s]  while you soak in the hybrid.
[2385.08s -> 2386.54s]  But Chris, don't breathe yet.
[2386.54s -> 2388.62s]  The way is locked by high-quality encryption.
[2389.96s -> 2391.08s]  You will never get inside.
[2391.72s -> 2392.52s]  Wait, Chris, look.
[2392.52s -> 2393.40s]  Here, those balloons.
[2393.96s -> 2395.56s]  Are you the 1000th customer?
[2396.44s -> 2397.72s]  As a commemorative ring,
[2397.72s -> 2399.48s]  I will let you buy key-gen from me
[2399.48s -> 2400.36s]  at the low, low price.
[2401.56s -> 2402.60s]  What do you think?
[2402.60s -> 2403.64s]  It's such a steal.
[2403.64s -> 2406.84s]  I'm, I'm, I'm myself.
[2406.84s -> 2407.88s]  I'm shitting myself.
[2408.84s -> 2410.36s]  Take this deal and you will die.
[2410.36s -> 2411.00s]  It's that good.
[2412.34s -> 2413.38s]  Buy the key-gen from me.
[2413.38s -> 2415.30s]  Unlock the basement and get that empty disc.
[2420.39s -> 2422.65s]  Okay, fear.
[2423.61s -> 2424.65s]  What are you afraid of?
[2425.37s -> 2427.21s]  According to encyclopedia of
[2427.45s -> 2428.09s]  being afraid.
[2428.89s -> 2430.73s]  There's nothing to fear except
[2430.73s -> 2436.28s]  can anyone hear me?
[2437.66s -> 2440.36s]  Help, help.
[2440.36s -> 2440.92s]  Huh, what?
[2440.92s -> 2442.44s]  No, I didn't hear anything just now.
[2443.32s -> 2444.52s]  But it sounded kind of
[2444.52s -> 2445.40s]  like they were talking to you.
[2452.73s -> 2454.25s]  Buy key-gen from me
[2454.25s -> 2456.09s]  and go to Queen's mansion.
[2456.09s -> 2457.99s]  How do I get the key-gen?
[2460.79s -> 2461.03s]  What?
[2461.03s -> 2462.15s]  Go by myself, Chris.
[2462.15s -> 2463.19s]  No, the men inside,
[2463.19s -> 2464.79s]  the men inside would.
[2464.79s -> 2468.31s]  How do I buy it?
[2468.95s -> 2473.72s]  He just said buy.
[2486.17s -> 2487.29s]  Exit and buy more.
[2488.90s -> 2489.38s]  Oh, fuck.
[2489.38s -> 2490.50s]  I've been talking to him the whole time.
[2490.50s -> 2492.02s]  Okay.
[2492.02s -> 2492.98s]  Buy.
[2492.98s -> 2493.78s]  Hurry up and buy.
[2494.42s -> 2497.40s]  For a second I thought that was the menu.
[2497.40s -> 2497.88s]  Okay.
[2497.88s -> 2498.36s]  Buy.
[2498.36s -> 2498.84s]  Buy more.
[2502.04s -> 2502.76s]  What the fuck?
[2505.54s -> 2507.54s]  Key-gen S potion.
[2508.63s -> 2509.75s]  The big one.
[2509.75s -> 2511.75s]  B-shot bow tie or run away.
[2514.26s -> 2515.94s]  This is supposed to be like a market.
[2515.94s -> 2517.70s]  I have to catch this when it's 30 bucks.
[2519.93s -> 2520.97s]  Oh my god.
[2525.50s -> 2534.41s]  Oh, for seven bucks.
[2534.41s -> 2540.10s]  All right, what about this one?
[2540.10s -> 2542.10s]  Item, item affects HP a lot.
[2542.10s -> 2543.14s]  Okay, can I get this one too?
[2543.38s -> 2546.98s]  80.
[2546.98s -> 2548.02s]  All right, that's fine.
[2548.02s -> 2548.82s]  What about the...
[2549.38s -> 2550.10s]  What the fuck?
[2551.50s -> 2552.62s]  The big one.
[2552.62s -> 2554.30s]  Cut anything in two pieces.
[2554.30s -> 2554.70s]  Criminal.
[2565.08s -> 2565.72s]  Oh, wait.
[2565.72s -> 2568.57s]  I don't have to actually accept it.
[2568.57s -> 2569.93s]  Oh, well, okay.
[2569.93s -> 2571.05s]  I thought it was like you had to click it
[2571.05s -> 2571.93s]  and it just bought it.
[2578.44s -> 2578.84s]  Take it.
[2579.64s -> 2581.88s]  Can I buy these?
[2589.58s -> 2590.82s]  Can I buy...
[2590.82s -> 2591.94s]  Okay, I got two.
[2591.94s -> 2597.18s]  Should I get more of these potions?
[2597.18s -> 2599.96s]  Stop, stop.
[2599.96s -> 2601.00s]  Scam, scam, scam, scam.
[2601.00s -> 2601.64s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[2601.64s -> 2602.28s]  Stop getting scammed.
[2602.28s -> 2602.76s]  What are you talking about?
[2602.76s -> 2603.64s]  All right, run away.
[2603.64s -> 2605.54s]  Buy.
[2605.54s -> 2609.91s]  You're buying weapons.
[2609.91s -> 2610.41s]  Oh.
[2613.19s -> 2616.28s]  Get more potions.
[2616.28s -> 2617.00s]  Should I?
[2617.00s -> 2620.66s]  Okay.
[2620.66s -> 2621.06s]  Talking.
[2621.86s -> 2622.26s]  Friends.
[2623.43s -> 2624.23s]  Yeah, well, I think we're good.
[2632.84s -> 2633.48s]  Buy more.
[2636.12s -> 2636.86s]  Okay, let's go.
[2643.29s -> 2644.81s]  Exit and buy more and then escape.
[2647.16s -> 2648.70s]  Mansion, basement.
[2649.90s -> 2650.40s]  Find it.
[2652.70s -> 2654.76s]  Creepy stuff were you buying anyway.
[2655.40s -> 2656.52s]  Ah, like I even want to know.
[2656.52s -> 2657.02s]  Yikes.
[2657.95s -> 2660.43s]  She said she hoped if it was candy,
[2660.43s -> 2661.23s]  you'd share with her.
[2662.27s -> 2662.77s]  Shut up.
[2663.47s -> 2666.40s]  Chris, what was it?
[2671.60s -> 2672.96s]  Raid bow tie.
[2672.96s -> 2673.92s]  Oh, it just goes down.
[2674.72s -> 2680.83s]  Oh, what the fuck.
[2680.83s -> 2681.33s]  Poison.
[2685.00s -> 2685.50s]  Oops.
[2687.42s -> 2688.46s]  Well, I have the key, right?
[2688.46s -> 2690.22s]  So I can go to the basement and the mansion.
[2690.86s -> 2702.28s]  Funny little guy was looking for you.
[2702.28s -> 2702.78s]  Yep.
[2706.76s -> 2711.95s]  Okay, so let's go back to the mansion.
[2712.51s -> 2714.11s]  I wonder if I can go in another door now.
[2714.67s -> 2722.09s]  All right, I'm just going to sell this junk.
[2722.09s -> 2722.81s]  Maybe I shouldn't.
[2722.81s -> 2723.37s]  I might need it.
[2724.25s -> 2731.96s]  All right, I need the basement of the mansion.
[2732.52s -> 2735.66s]  Let's go this way.
[2744.96s -> 2747.20s]  I see you have escaped from your room unit.
[2747.92s -> 2751.61s]  Who can blame you for wanting to see my glorious mansion?
[2752.57s -> 2754.81s]  You won't want to take your eyes off this beautiful art.
[2755.53s -> 2757.82s]  We're not here to look at your stupid pictures.
[2758.54s -> 2759.90s]  That was not a recommendation.
[2760.62s -> 2762.30s]  I was just warning you.
[2762.30s -> 2763.34s]  Laughing my ass off.
[2766.65s -> 2767.15s]  Oh, fuck.
[2768.33s -> 2769.13s]  Oh, my goodness.
[2776.06s -> 2776.70s]  Go down first.
[2782.01s -> 2782.51s]  What's that?
[2782.97s -> 2783.84s]  What's that?
[2784.46s -> 2784.96s]  Basement.
[2791.36s -> 2794.12s]  Wait, did that do anything?
[2800.65s -> 2801.29s]  Oh, shit.
[2804.38s -> 2807.53s]  Ooh, found a revivement.
[2817.32s -> 2818.76s]  Hey, I thought it was going to be lower than that.
[2819.32s -> 2825.48s]  Okay, and the notes.
[2825.48s -> 2825.98s]  All right, let's go.
[2826.76s -> 2832.56s]  Oh, I know you are all loving my mansion.
[2833.36s -> 2835.36s]  We have a few rules around here you have to follow.
[2836.08s -> 2837.36s]  One, wipe your shoes.
[2837.36s -> 2838.56s]  Two, have fun.
[2838.56s -> 2839.92s]  Three, respect the pottery.
[2840.72s -> 2841.52s]  Four, have fun.
[2842.24s -> 2844.48s]  Five, missed entry duplication error.
[2845.44s -> 2848.92s]  I was trying to talk.
[2848.92s -> 2850.04s]  I was trying to hang out with it.
[2852.03s -> 2852.53s]  What the fuck?
[2853.15s -> 2856.17s]  Okay, so what we got?
[2858.99s -> 2860.75s]  Warmify, coldify.
[2864.54s -> 2866.14s]  Bluer two stages.
[2866.14s -> 2867.26s]  Redder two stages.
[2869.34s -> 2870.46s]  Coldify the red.
[2873.23s -> 2875.82s]  And then we're going to see what this does.
[2878.64s -> 2879.28s]  Half cold.
[2880.36s -> 2881.32s]  All right, we're going to see what this does.
[2881.32s -> 2881.88s]  What does this do?
[2882.68s -> 2885.56s]  Talked about the crunch of the last pickle in the refrigerator.
[2887.44s -> 2889.36s]  Okay, so now it's watching the color turn a lot colder.
[2889.36s -> 2889.92s]  It's now yellow.
[2889.92s -> 2891.04s]  All right, so now they both match.
[2891.84s -> 2897.76s]  Oh, there's candy in that one.
[2897.76s -> 2898.48s]  Oh, god damn it.
[2898.48s -> 2898.96s]  I want the candy.
[2899.52s -> 2912.92s]  Oh, super frog.
[2913.56s -> 2915.00s]  Pottery not respected.
[2915.80s -> 2919.68s]  I mean, I was trying to just see what it was.
[2919.68s -> 2920.80s]  See what it was.
[2920.80s -> 2922.16s]  All right, so just don't break the pottery.
[2922.16s -> 2923.52s]  But I kind of want to break the pottery.
[2924.24s -> 2926.86s]  Oh, because I want to recruit those guys.
[2927.58s -> 2931.42s]  Oh, they're just here anyways.
[2931.42s -> 2931.92s]  Okay.
[2932.38s -> 2939.60s]  All right, we need to warmify blue.
[2940.48s -> 2941.72s]  And we need to...
[2942.68s -> 2944.35s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[2944.35s -> 2947.55s]  We need to coldify you.
[2948.59s -> 2949.95s]  We need to half warm you.
[2950.91s -> 2952.73s]  And then we're going to defend with you.
[2953.77s -> 2955.29s]  No, they don't have to be...
[2955.29s -> 2956.49s]  Well, yeah, they have to be yellow.
[2956.49s -> 2957.13s]  Yeah, I got it right.
[2957.85s -> 2962.62s]  They have to be yellow, right?
[2963.18s -> 2974.54s]  What are you doing?
[2975.58s -> 2977.02s]  Oh, they just have to be the same color.
[2977.02s -> 2977.98s]  They don't have to all be yellow?
[2979.63s -> 2981.87s]  Oh, I thought it was like blue was going to be tired.
[2981.87s -> 2983.15s]  Yellow was spare.
[2983.15s -> 2984.83s]  Oh, they just have to be the same color.
[2985.47s -> 2988.09s]  Okay, I thought it was like they had to be yellow.
[2988.09s -> 2989.85s]  It's like that's how you spare.
[2989.85s -> 2990.25s]  I don't know.
[2990.25s -> 2990.73s]  I don't know.
[2990.73s -> 2991.85s]  That's a Toby Fox game.
[2991.85s -> 2992.57s]  Could be anything.
[2993.37s -> 2997.95s]  All right, let's go.
[2997.95s -> 3001.18s]  So now I have to do warmify.
[3001.18s -> 3002.30s]  Well, let's just make them all yellow.
[3003.32s -> 3004.52s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[3004.52s -> 3013.15s]  Coldify you, warmify you, and then you spare you.
[3013.15s -> 3013.71s]  This will do it.
[3016.27s -> 3016.59s]  Hello.
[3016.59s -> 3021.60s]  Ding, ding, ding, ding.
[3021.60s -> 3023.20s]  That was a voice crack, but I saved it.
[3028.83s -> 3029.39s]  Andy.
[3029.39s -> 3030.11s]  Got it.
[3030.11s -> 3037.53s]  All right, now we just spare.
[3038.25s -> 3043.44s]  Four to five.
[3043.44s -> 3043.76s]  Nice.
[3044.48s -> 3047.31s]  $328.
[3048.59s -> 3057.12s]  And check every window.
[3062.62s -> 3063.50s]  Andy, Andy.
[3065.68s -> 3066.56s]  Is this supposed to be a race?
[3070.83s -> 3073.15s]  One, two, three, four.
[3073.15s -> 3074.43s]  Okay, one.
[3074.43s -> 3075.87s]  Painting is labeled task.
[3079.36s -> 3081.28s]  Painting is labeled Timberley.
[3081.92s -> 3087.13s]  Painting is labeled task.
[3087.85s -> 3091.96s]  Painting is labeled task.
[3092.52s -> 3096.06s]  I don't get it.
[3096.06s -> 3104.76s]  Is this person's name Timberley?
[3106.24s -> 3106.80s]  Timberley.
[3113.28s -> 3114.48s]  All right, am I going to remember this?
[3114.48s -> 3117.28s]  Task spelled correctly.
[3117.28s -> 3121.82s]  Task, Timberley, task with a Q.
[3121.82s -> 3123.18s]  Task, Timberley, task.
[3125.04s -> 3125.44s]  TASK.
[3126.32s -> 3130.40s]  Task, Timberley, task, TASK.
[3130.40s -> 3130.72s]  Got it.
[3131.52s -> 3134.19s]  Just in time for your appointment.
[3134.19s -> 3136.03s]  Would you assist in organizing these paintings?
[3136.99s -> 3137.23s]  Yes.
[3138.49s -> 3139.21s]  I'll refine.
[3139.85s -> 3140.89s]  Then the first question.
[3141.92s -> 3144.88s]  Which painting's name is first alphabetically?
[3147.40s -> 3147.80s]  Task.
[3148.60s -> 3149.36s]  Okay.
[3150.33s -> 3155.13s]  Ask, T-A, T-A-S, T-A-S-K.
[3156.01s -> 3157.68s]  Timberley is T-I.
[3158.48s -> 3159.39s]  There's I.
[3160.27s -> 3161.63s]  So K is above that.
[3161.63s -> 3161.87s]  Q.
[3162.75s -> 3164.03s]  All right, the four.
[3164.03s -> 3165.87s]  Wait, number four.
[3165.87s -> 3166.67s]  How do I say four?
[3167.47s -> 3169.50s]  Number four was tasked with a Q.
[3170.30s -> 3171.10s]  The left painting is four.
[3171.10s -> 3173.02s]  Why is it not, it's four.
[3173.90s -> 3175.31s]  I'll refine.
[3175.87s -> 3176.67s]  And the next question.
[3177.31s -> 3179.47s]  Which painting's name is third alphabetically?
[3180.03s -> 3182.00s]  Okay, that would be, so,
[3183.76s -> 3185.04s]  K, tasked with a K,
[3186.16s -> 3186.88s]  tasked with a Q,
[3186.88s -> 3190.84s]  tasked with a C was that one.
[3192.04s -> 3192.92s]  Wait, what was the question?
[3193.56s -> 3196.12s]  Because that would be Timberley and then task.
[3196.12s -> 3196.76s]  Okay, bottom.
[3197.56s -> 3198.38s]  I'll refine.
[3198.38s -> 3199.74s]  Then the next question.
[3199.74s -> 3200.86s]  Which painting is fourth?
[3202.49s -> 3207.45s]  Task, Timberley, task, TASK.
[3208.17s -> 3213.34s]  That's correct.
[3213.34s -> 3214.94s]  I'm so happy I could whip something.
[3218.14s -> 3219.66s]  Task manager blocks the way.
[3220.38s -> 3223.82s]  I can already spare task manager?
[3224.62s -> 3225.02s]  Really?
[3225.58s -> 3226.72s]  Holy shit.
[3227.84s -> 3228.40s]  Yeah, let's go.
[3229.20s -> 3237.02s]  Oh, yeah.
[3240.33s -> 3240.65s]  Whoa.
[3241.37s -> 3244.76s]  It's because you got them all right.
[3244.76s -> 3245.24s]  Oh, okay.
[3248.27s -> 3248.59s]  Nice.
[3249.15s -> 3250.56s]  All right.
[3253.87s -> 3254.59s]  Second floor.
[3254.59s -> 3254.99s]  Oh, wait.
[3254.99s -> 3256.43s]  All right, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[3256.43s -> 3257.96s]  Not doing that yet.
[3259.32s -> 3265.02s]  Three, two, three.
[3265.02s -> 3266.14s]  Oh, I can't walk through that?
[3266.94s -> 3267.44s]  Huh?
[3277.04s -> 3278.00s]  Oh, shit.
[3279.92s -> 3280.42s]  Why?
[3284.36s -> 3295.20s]  Oh, it's the hacker.
[3296.64s -> 3298.08s]  Hacker.
[3298.08s -> 3299.20s]  Oh, for God's sake, it's a hacker.
[3299.92s -> 3300.42s]  Hacker.
[3301.06s -> 3303.55s]  He became lost in the craftsmanship.
[3304.11s -> 3305.56s]  Come here.
[3305.94s -> 3309.58s]  I'm the hacker.
[3309.58s -> 3312.48s]  I got the feeling there's a secret back door in this room.
[3313.36s -> 3314.90s]  Where could it be?
[3318.14s -> 3319.18s]  I'm the hacker.
[3319.18s -> 3322.78s]  Secret back door.
[3322.78s -> 3323.28s]  Chainmail.
[3325.44s -> 3326.40s]  Secret back door.
[3327.20s -> 3331.65s]  He became lost in the craftsmanship.
[3332.37s -> 3337.02s]  He became lost in the...
[3337.02s -> 3338.14s]  Wait, did his head just...
[3338.14s -> 3339.02s]  His head's an arrow.
[3339.82s -> 3341.36s]  Is he, like, pointing to it?
[3342.00s -> 3344.86s]  Is he, like, pointing up?
[3344.86s -> 3346.06s]  He's, like, pointing his finger up.
[3346.78s -> 3348.29s]  Is it...
[3348.29s -> 3348.79s]  Is that what...
[3350.19s -> 3350.59s]  Yeah.
[3350.59s -> 3351.31s]  Okay, I got it.
[3353.63s -> 3354.35s]  Secret switch.
[3356.90s -> 3358.10s]  I was wondering.
[3358.10s -> 3359.14s]  I thought I was seeing things.
[3359.14s -> 3360.66s]  His head, like, turned into a pointer.
[3361.38s -> 3369.41s]  Okay.
[3369.41s -> 3377.95s]  I thought I was seeing things.
[3377.95s -> 3378.45s]  Switch.
[3379.84s -> 3380.34s]  Whoa.
[3381.50s -> 3382.30s]  You walked past it?
[3382.30s -> 3382.80s]  What'd I do?
[3383.58s -> 3384.08s]  What?
[3384.30s -> 3391.36s]  What is it?
[3391.36s -> 3392.93s]  You got it.
[3392.93s -> 3393.73s]  What are you talking about?
[3393.73s -> 3394.13s]  You're fine.
[3394.13s -> 3394.63s]  Yeah, what?
[3395.41s -> 3399.54s]  You guys need to relax and stop it.
[3400.26s -> 3402.34s]  Whoa, this is a secret entrance.
[3402.98s -> 3413.20s]  Okay, so then what does this do?
[3413.20s -> 3418.46s]  First, use the key...
[3418.46s -> 3420.30s]  Oh, this is the secret.
[3420.86s -> 3421.50s]  I found it.
[3422.54s -> 3423.10s]  I got it.
[3425.86s -> 3427.06s]  The key gen just went in there.
[3427.06s -> 3427.62s]  We're going to the...
[3427.62s -> 3428.98s]  First, you want us to stay here?
[3430.88s -> 3431.60s]  Sure, whatever.
[3432.32s -> 3433.84s]  Me and Rousey will have fun without you.
[3437.50s -> 3438.06s]  Oh, shit.
[3453.74s -> 3454.24s]  God.
[3454.78s -> 3471.39s]  Hey.
[3471.39s -> 3477.73s]  There was nothing in there.
[3477.73s -> 3482.56s]  Wait a minute.
[3482.56s -> 3483.36s]  Chain mail.
[3483.36s -> 3485.90s]  Put the chain mail on.
[3486.70s -> 3487.66s]  And the...
[3487.66s -> 3489.10s]  Whoa, why is frayed bow tie better?
[3490.59s -> 3491.09s]  What?
[3491.09s -> 3501.90s]  How come I got enough shit on?
[3511.30s -> 3511.80s]  Bye!
[3512.62s -> 3514.46s]  Holy shit, I didn't think that was gonna happen that quickly.
[3515.02s -> 3516.94s]  One of these is fake.
[3518.56s -> 3519.36s]  One.
[3519.36s -> 3520.00s]  Two.
[3520.00s -> 3520.80s]  Three.
[3520.80s -> 3521.04s]  Four.
[3521.04s -> 3522.72s]  I'm closing my eyes and flipping a coin.
[3522.72s -> 3523.60s]  Closing my eyes, flipping a coin.
[3523.60s -> 3524.32s]  Flip, flip, flip, flip.
[3524.32s -> 3524.82s]  It's tails.
[3525.44s -> 3529.14s]  To open the treasure, inside was one dark dollar.
[3529.14s -> 3534.02s]  One dark dollar was added to your money hole.
[3534.02s -> 3534.42s]  Got it.
[3534.42s -> 3535.22s]  That was right.
[3535.22s -> 3559.44s]  That's the deal.
[3560.06s -> 3563.74s]  Oh, shit.
[3563.74s -> 3564.30s]  I can't leave.
[3564.94s -> 3565.44s]  No.
[3570.48s -> 3574.22s]  I'm not spinning this.
[3575.18s -> 3597.36s]  What was that?
[3598.62s -> 3600.54s]  Sounds like a force field powering down.
[3601.26s -> 3603.09s]  Oh, the one upstairs.
[3614.08s -> 3615.04s]  What the fuck?
[3615.04s -> 3616.08s]  I wasn't ready for this shit.
[3616.08s -> 3617.28s]  I'm using the controller.
[3617.28s -> 3618.40s]  What the fuck?
[3618.40s -> 3623.26s]  I didn't know that was gonna happen.
[3623.26s -> 3625.42s]  I have the dumb ass controller in my hand.
[3628.94s -> 3631.10s]  I can't, you can't spin with the controller.
[3631.10s -> 3632.30s]  Okay, I'm gonna have to use the key.
[3632.30s -> 3633.26s]  What am I gonna do with that one?
[3633.26s -> 3634.14s]  D-pad?
[3634.14s -> 3652.86s]  No, I'm gonna use the, I'm gonna use the probably keypad.
[3652.86s -> 3654.61s]  Arrow keys.
[3654.61s -> 3655.86s]  All right, let's go.
[3655.86s -> 3657.10s]  Arrow keys.
[3657.10s -> 3658.30s]  All right, I'm ready.
[3658.30s -> 3659.42s]  Arrow keys.
[3659.42s -> 3659.92s]  Go.
[3669.44s -> 3670.80s]  Holy shit, this is fucking hard.
[3670.80s -> 3671.60s]  All right, let's go for it.
[3678.21s -> 3679.73s]  I'm trapped here until I get out.
[3700.37s -> 3702.29s]  Okay, I gotta get it down.
[3715.90s -> 3716.40s]  Fuck.
[3716.86s -> 3717.36s]  Fuck.
[3718.14s -> 3719.50s]  It's like the, you know what it is?
[3719.98s -> 3723.42s]  It's like the wrapping thing for my brain.
[3723.42s -> 3724.46s]  I don't know why.
[3724.46s -> 3727.74s]  Okay, if anybody else feels like this, you tell me if I'm accurate, right?
[3727.74s -> 3733.74s]  I don't know why when it comes to like things that spin, it inverts itself in my brain.
[3733.74s -> 3738.77s]  If I have to like scrap around left to get to right,
[3738.77s -> 3740.93s]  it's almost like I have to go right to get to left.
[3740.93s -> 3742.29s]  It's like, it's reversed in my brain.
[3746.32s -> 3746.96s]  Same, same.
[3746.96s -> 3747.60s]  Yeah, same.
[3747.60s -> 3748.32s]  Yeah, no, thanks.
[3748.88s -> 3752.51s]  That was a good effort.
[3752.51s -> 3754.66s]  Will he beat the teacup wheel this time?
[3757.63s -> 3760.83s]  Um, do I, do I have to, I'm gonna wait for the prediction to be in?
[3761.39s -> 3766.10s]  Okay, it's the shadows.
[3766.10s -> 3767.46s]  Yeah, I know, I know.
[3767.46s -> 3771.06s]  Um, it's just, look, my brain's gotta, my brain, I don't know why I said it like that.
[3773.90s -> 3775.42s]  Will I beat the teacup this round?
[3775.42s -> 3778.10s]  Okay, and let's go.
[3789.42s -> 3790.22s]  Fucking hell.
[3792.03s -> 3793.95s]  It's the, it's the going left and right.
[3793.95s -> 3794.99s]  I'm not gonna be able to do this.
[3795.79s -> 3797.95s]  It's like the rotating motion.
[3797.95s -> 3799.15s]  It's not left and right.
[3799.15s -> 3800.03s]  It's like wrapping.
[3800.75s -> 3808.98s]  I almost think I should just go one direction.
[3808.98s -> 3810.90s]  I'm trying to look at the shadows on the ground.
[3810.90s -> 3813.14s]  But like when I go, oh, I have to go left.
[3813.14s -> 3818.02s]  But where I currently am, like I could go right around and get there faster.
[3818.02s -> 3819.38s]  But you have to go left.
[3819.38s -> 3821.46s]  I hate circles.
[3821.46s -> 3822.74s]  I can't, I don't like rotating.
[3823.30s -> 3829.34s]  All right, these predictions are not gonna happen as fast as these attempts are gonna be.
[3830.42s -> 3830.90s]  I'm going.
[3848.14s -> 3855.17s]  What the fuck?
[3855.17s -> 3855.89s]  I did.
[3855.89s -> 3861.49s]  Oh, I feel bad for people that bet last time.
[3861.49s -> 3873.74s]  Not over yet though.
[3873.74s -> 3874.78s]  If I die here, I'm gonna stop.
[3877.18s -> 3878.06s]  I need to take an item.
[3878.70s -> 3879.18s]  I don't care.
[3879.74s -> 3896.66s]  I almost ate the poison.
[3896.66s -> 3923.41s]  What?
[3923.41s -> 3925.01s]  Oh, I'll give you a good one.
[3925.01s -> 3925.97s]  I'm gonna give you a really good one.
[3925.97s -> 3926.47s]  Ready?
[3926.85s -> 3928.46s]  I have to like kind of prepare for it.
[3928.46s -> 3929.98s]  It's got to be like pressure.
[3929.98s -> 3931.90s]  The thing to do the Monka S very well.
[3931.90s -> 3933.98s]  Yeah, it's a lot of pressure in your like upper throat.
[3939.84s -> 3940.48s]  Monka S.
[3940.48s -> 3941.20s]  No, that was bad.
[3942.24s -> 3942.88s]  Monka S.
[3943.95s -> 3944.59s]  Monka S.
[3944.59s -> 3945.47s]  There we go.
[3945.47s -> 3949.73s]  I have just like poison in my inventory.
[3950.29s -> 3950.77s]  I don't have any.
[3950.77s -> 3951.41s]  I have nothing.
[3951.97s -> 3955.12s]  All right, Revive Mint, the cookie.
[3956.54s -> 3958.22s]  Ooh, spaghetti.
[3958.22s -> 3958.86s]  30H.
[3958.86s -> 3960.38s]  No, I need more items.
[3960.38s -> 3961.58s]  Can I buy something for somebody?
[3962.38s -> 3964.30s]  I just do try this with no items or something.
[3964.30s -> 3964.86s]  I'm gonna lose.
[3965.50s -> 3968.26s]  There's gonna be like a secret fight back here.
[3968.26s -> 3970.66s]  It's gonna be like Jevil 2 and I'm gonna lose instantly.
[3970.66s -> 3995.62s]  Go back to the shop.
[3995.62s -> 3996.74s]  I think I'm gonna go back to the shop.
[3998.43s -> 3999.87s]  Yeah, I'm going back to the shop.
[3999.87s -> 4004.54s]  I'm gonna stock up on heals.
[4004.54s -> 4007.42s]  I'm gonna do the thing I do in every single RPG.
[4007.42s -> 4008.62s]  Well, I don't have a party, but...
[4009.26s -> 4011.98s]  So every time I played an RPG, I was so bad at them.
[4011.98s -> 4014.08s]  It was terrible.
[4014.08s -> 4014.64s]  I would just...
[4015.52s -> 4017.28s]  It took me like probably like a few years,
[4017.28s -> 4020.08s]  maybe like five to ten years after playing a lot of RPGs for SNES.
[4020.88s -> 4021.44s]  No, no.
[4021.44s -> 4022.00s]  What? What are you doing?
[4022.00s -> 4022.32s]  What are you doing?
[4022.32s -> 4023.76s]  What? Back seat, back seat, chat, chill.
[4023.76s -> 4024.32s]  What are you talking about?
[4025.71s -> 4026.27s]  Stop him.
[4026.27s -> 4027.63s]  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[4028.94s -> 4030.14s]  Do I close this out if I go up?
[4032.29s -> 4033.81s]  Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[4033.81s -> 4035.57s]  Am I gonna luck it up if I go up?
[4035.57s -> 4036.21s]  All right, whatever.
[4036.21s -> 4036.71s]  Fine.
[4038.98s -> 4044.59s]  So anyways, I would be so bad at these games
[4044.59s -> 4048.03s]  that I would fill my entire inventory with the revive...
[4048.75s -> 4050.11s]  Whatever it was in the game.
[4050.11s -> 4053.63s]  Whether it was a revive juice or a like cure
[4053.63s -> 4055.47s]  that brought the person back to life.
[4055.47s -> 4058.11s]  People would just die and I would do revive on them.
[4058.11s -> 4059.71s]  I wouldn't even try to heal them.
[4059.71s -> 4062.69s]  I think at some point, like when I played the Mario RPG,
[4062.69s -> 4066.96s]  I'd have like 80% pick me up so we're in my inventory.
[4066.96s -> 4067.60s]  And nothing else.
[4067.60s -> 4069.52s]  I wouldn't even use mushrooms or heals or anything.
[4070.08s -> 4076.38s]  Though I just like didn't get it.
[4076.38s -> 4080.05s]  Oh, the back seaters are getting back seated.
[4081.98s -> 4083.10s]  Oh, shit.
[4083.10s -> 4085.18s]  That's a level I didn't think we'd reach today.
[4085.92s -> 4089.52s]  The back seaters in chat are being back seated
[4089.52s -> 4092.90s]  by people back seating them.
[4092.90s -> 4093.46s]  Huh?
[4093.54s -> 4101.28s]  There's nothing interesting.
[4101.28s -> 4102.74s]  There's nothing interesting.
[4103.30s -> 4105.17s]  There's nothing interesting.
[4105.17s -> 4107.23s]  Nothing.
[4107.23s -> 4108.24s]  Nothing.
[4108.24s -> 4109.44s]  There's gonna be a screamer in one of these.
[4126.13s -> 4128.21s]  There's something shining inside the old machine.
[4128.21s -> 4130.59s]  Do you take it?
[4130.59s -> 4130.91s]  Yes.
[4132.00s -> 4134.16s]  The empty disk was added to your key items.
[4134.72s -> 4136.35s]  Oh, I got the disk.
[4136.35s -> 4136.91s]  I got the disk.
[4136.91s -> 4137.23s]  I got it.
[4137.23s -> 4137.47s]  I got it.
[4137.47s -> 4137.71s]  I got it.
[4137.71s -> 4138.83s]  It comes to the Indiana Jones part.
[4166.59s -> 4167.15s]  Empty disk.
[4167.15s -> 4168.83s]  A data disk from a strange machine.
[4168.83s -> 4170.11s]  Didn't someone want this?
[4172.46s -> 4173.42s]  I'm gonna bring it back.
[4173.42s -> 4173.90s]  Oh, God.
[4173.90s -> 4174.70s]  This is gonna get weird.
[4175.42s -> 4194.61s]  Come on, Susie.
[4194.61s -> 4195.89s]  Give me my glasses back.
[4197.25s -> 4197.89s]  Look at me.
[4197.89s -> 4198.69s]  Oh, look at me.
[4198.69s -> 4199.09s]  Look at me.
[4199.09s -> 4200.85s]  I'm a big dweeb that loves homework.
[4203.54s -> 4204.02s]  Come on.
[4205.95s -> 4206.35s]  Fine.
[4206.35s -> 4206.91s]  Take them back.
[4208.40s -> 4208.80s]  Thank you.
[4209.44s -> 4210.08s]  Oh, Chris.
[4210.08s -> 4210.64s]  Everything okay?
[4213.02s -> 4213.26s]  Yes.
[4214.14s -> 4214.46s]  Whatever.
[4214.46s -> 4214.86s]  Let's go.
[4215.42s -> 4215.58s]  All right.
[4215.58s -> 4217.42s]  Cool.
[4217.42s -> 4218.38s]  I got the data disk.
[4219.02s -> 4220.77s]  I got the data disk.
[4226.75s -> 4227.23s]  Cafe.
[4228.51s -> 4229.39s]  Welcome to the cafe.
[4229.39s -> 4229.63s]  All right.
[4229.63s -> 4230.59s]  So we've got butt juice.
[4230.59s -> 4231.31s]  100 HP.
[4231.31s -> 4232.67s]  I'm gonna buy like a shitload of these.
[4233.23s -> 4239.04s]  Is that too many?
[4239.60s -> 4241.31s]  I don't know.
[4241.31s -> 4242.75s]  I'm playing this like I play every RPG.
[4242.75s -> 4244.03s]  I just buy a shitload of them.
[4244.03s -> 4247.68s]  I'm buying another one.
[4248.24s -> 4260.37s]  Okay.
[4260.37s -> 4260.69s]  Get this.
[4260.69s -> 4261.89s]  What do I want?
[4261.89s -> 4262.85s]  The Lancer Cookie.
[4262.85s -> 4263.33s]  Heals one.
[4263.33s -> 4264.05s]  Maybe I should keep it.
[4264.77s -> 4270.61s]  Is it Lancer Cookie?
[4270.61s -> 4271.09s]  Should I just get it?
[4271.09s -> 4271.73s]  I'm getting rid of this.
[4273.97s -> 4274.69s]  Revive Mint.
[4274.69s -> 4275.25s]  Spaghetti.
[4275.25s -> 4275.49s]  Yeah.
[4275.49s -> 4276.21s]  This 30 HP.
[4276.21s -> 4276.69s]  30 HP.
[4276.69s -> 4277.41s]  This is a revive.
[4278.21s -> 4281.52s]  I don't think I want this.
[4281.52s -> 4282.56s]  I want heals.
[4283.44s -> 4290.26s]  All right.
[4290.26s -> 4292.02s]  I just have my full inventory of healing.
[4292.66s -> 4293.76s]  T is a heal.
[4294.24s -> 4300.11s]  It heals more in battle.
[4300.11s -> 4301.31s]  Well, we're gonna try it like this.
[4301.31s -> 4303.71s]  Because if this is like a big fight that I'm doing,
[4304.27s -> 4305.39s]  I'm gonna go for it.
[4305.95s -> 4308.75s]  Let's go bring it.
[4308.75s -> 4311.39s]  Let's go bring it to him and see what happens here.
[4311.39s -> 4313.15s]  I have a feeling this is gonna be...
[4313.15s -> 4313.95s]  He's gonna freak out.
[4314.59s -> 4327.84s]  I'm gonna give him the data disk and he's gonna be like...
[4327.84s -> 4328.96s]  All of a sudden you can start here and like...
[4331.84s -> 4333.12s]  That's how you know like here it comes.
[4333.12s -> 4334.72s]  Like Toby Fox is gonna give you a banger.
[4335.28s -> 4337.15s]  I'm gonna go in the inventory.
[4337.79s -> 4338.43s]  Here it comes.
[4338.43s -> 4339.55s]  I'm gonna put it into...
[4339.55s -> 4339.95s]  Oh, yeah.
[4339.95s -> 4340.67s]  You brought the disk.
[4341.23s -> 4341.79s]  Enter.
[4341.79s -> 4342.03s]  Buy.
[4345.71s -> 4348.61s]  Oh, you should have done that.
[4350.51s -> 4350.99s]  Hey, everyone.
[4350.99s -> 4351.87s]  It's me.
[4351.87s -> 4355.70s]  Okay.
[4355.70s -> 4356.50s]  Talking.
[4356.50s -> 4357.86s]  Give disk.
[4357.86s -> 4361.07s]  Okay.
[4361.07s -> 4361.95s]  Well, I have it saved.
[4361.95s -> 4362.83s]  So this is a bad idea.
[4362.83s -> 4363.95s]  We'll see what happens.
[4363.95s -> 4366.16s]  There we go.
[4366.16s -> 4366.80s]  Give disk.
[4368.24s -> 4368.96s]  Chris.
[4368.96s -> 4369.52s]  You did it.
[4369.52s -> 4370.16s]  You...
[4370.16s -> 4370.64s]  Wee.
[4370.64s -> 4371.84s]  A little wormy.
[4371.84s -> 4372.64s]  You brought me the disk.
[4373.60s -> 4374.64s]  Oh, gee mama.
[4374.64s -> 4376.40s]  I can feel that smooth taste already.
[4377.44s -> 4378.56s]  Now, Chris, don't be greedy.
[4378.56s -> 4378.88s]  Hand it over.
[4378.88s -> 4379.36s]  Give me the disk.
[4380.08s -> 4382.08s]  Then we will transfer my...
[4385.20s -> 4387.92s]  Then, Chris, after this is very, very important,
[4387.92s -> 4390.80s]  go back and put the disk back where you got it.
[4391.52s -> 4394.40s]  Do that and you have my special guarantee.
[4394.40s -> 4396.24s]  I will pass my savings on to you.
[4397.58s -> 4399.66s]  Every big, every shot, every...
[4400.70s -> 4401.58s]  All yours, Chris.
[4402.85s -> 4404.53s]  So what do you say, big shot?
[4405.73s -> 4406.45s]  Warning.
[4406.45s -> 4408.53s]  If you consent to the terms and agreements,
[4408.53s -> 4416.34s]  our store is permanently closing down.
[4416.34s -> 4417.94s]  Finally, I knew you would...
[4420.02s -> 4421.30s]  Chris, here I go.
[4421.30s -> 4421.78s]  Begin to...
[4423.78s -> 4424.02s]  Oh.
[4424.58s -> 4437.39s]  So he's in the disk.
[4438.91s -> 4441.15s]  That was the worst noise.
[4442.59s -> 4444.03s]  So wait, he's in the disk?
[4448.72s -> 4449.12s]  Load it.
[4449.12s -> 4449.60s]  A strange...
[4449.60s -> 4451.36s]  You can feel it smiling in your hand.
[4453.28s -> 4455.20s]  Now we go put this back in the machine.
[4455.84s -> 4462.99s]  Throw the disk away.
[4462.99s -> 4466.08s]  Okay.
[4466.08s -> 4466.48s]  Mansion.
[4467.20s -> 4473.95s]  Save it.
[4473.95s -> 4482.45s]  Okay.
[4483.01s -> 4485.18s]  Put it back in here.
[4486.93s -> 4488.05s]  And then what?
[4488.05s -> 4490.11s]  I'm alone, though.
[4490.91s -> 4491.87s]  Wait a minute.
[4491.87s -> 4496.30s]  If I'm alone down here and I have to fight him in this...
[4496.30s -> 4497.82s]  I feel like I'm going to have to fight him.
[4497.82s -> 4499.76s]  I feel like I don't want spaghetti code.
[4504.18s -> 4504.74s]  I don't care.
[4504.74s -> 4505.14s]  Whatever.
[4505.14s -> 4505.70s]  Fuck it.
[4505.70s -> 4527.06s]  Okay, here we go.
[4527.94s -> 4534.18s]  There's a slot for a disk.
[4534.18s -> 4535.78s]  Insert the loaded disk.
[4535.78s -> 4536.02s]  Yes.
[4537.06s -> 4539.06s]  Put the disk into the broken down mechanism.
[4540.53s -> 4541.09s]  Nothing happened.
[4544.80s -> 4545.68s]  Tapped the mechanism.
[4546.48s -> 4547.04s]  Nothing happened.
[4547.76s -> 4549.20s]  Shook the mechanism.
[4549.20s -> 4549.76s]  You hit it.
[4550.32s -> 4550.88s]  You kicked it.
[4551.68s -> 4553.23s]  Nothing happened.
[4553.23s -> 4570.43s]  I feel like I have to do this.
[4571.39s -> 4572.51s]  Give me a sec.
[4574.93s -> 4577.41s]  Yeah, put it in MonkaW mode, please.
[4577.41s -> 4578.69s]  Give me one sec.
[4580.11s -> 4581.87s]  I just want to do something very quickly.
[4582.51s -> 4586.18s]  I feel like I'm going to have to put this on.
[4587.62s -> 4592.27s]  Because it's going to be probably an interesting,
[4593.79s -> 4595.47s]  interesting new voice I'm going to have to do.
[4596.11s -> 4599.90s]  Let's go ahead and check it out.
[4599.90s -> 4601.26s]  Let's see if that's a...
[4601.26s -> 4615.33s]  Let's see.
[4615.33s -> 4616.37s]  He's going to be a robot.
[4616.37s -> 4617.41s]  That's just a guarantee.
[4617.41s -> 4619.49s]  It's literally a guarantee.
[4619.49s -> 4620.85s]  There's no way he's not a robot.
[4623.71s -> 4625.68s]  Right, yeah.
[4625.68s -> 4627.02s]  Let's do...
[4627.02s -> 4628.14s]  Let's go with this one.
[4628.14s -> 4629.02s]  This one sounds pretty good.
[4629.58s -> 4630.22s]  I like this one.
[4631.17s -> 4631.89s]  I like this one.
[4631.89s -> 4632.85s]  How does this one sound?
[4632.85s -> 4634.13s]  Does this one hurt your ears?
[4634.13s -> 4635.25s]  It kind of hurts my ears.
[4636.19s -> 4636.67s]  No?
[4636.67s -> 4637.15s]  Yay?
[4637.15s -> 4637.87s]  Nay?
[4637.87s -> 4638.59s]  Which one?
[4638.59s -> 4643.10s]  You can't hear it?
[4643.10s -> 4645.02s]  Oh, I'm so excited.
[4645.02s -> 4645.90s]  I can't believe it.
[4645.90s -> 4650.82s]  I can't wait to tell you when I have them for you.
[4650.82s -> 4651.06s]  All right.
[4651.06s -> 4652.66s]  Although it doesn't hurt your ears when I scream.
[4654.50s -> 4655.14s]  Nay?
[4655.14s -> 4656.10s]  She had a lot of nays.
[4656.10s -> 4656.66s]  Seriously.
[4656.66s -> 4658.42s]  She had a lot of nays here.
[4658.42s -> 4664.66s]  How's this?
[4665.86s -> 4666.58s]  How's this?
[4666.58s -> 4684.48s]  This is normal?
[4695.17s -> 4696.37s]  I got to get in the mood to do this.
[4696.37s -> 4702.96s]  I'm back.
[4702.96s -> 4704.03s]  All right, here we go.
[4708.26s -> 4714.29s]  Oh, God.
[4725.65s -> 4726.15s]  Big.
[4726.85s -> 4727.35s]  Big.
[4728.13s -> 4739.68s]  Becoming better.
[4739.68s -> 4761.49s]  So I think I should go.
[4761.49s -> 4772.58s]  Send us in that little soul you have.
[4772.58s -> 4781.64s]  Chris.
[4783.26s -> 4784.38s]  The hell was that weirdo?
[4786.38s -> 4787.66s]  Chris, we were worried about you.
[4787.66s -> 4788.16s]  So...
[4792.75s -> 4793.25s]  Here it comes.
[4821.25s -> 4825.44s]  What are we doing?
[4825.44s -> 4827.98s]  What are we doing?
[4829.76s -> 4830.26s]  Whoa.
[4832.59s -> 4833.39s]  Oh, shit.
[4833.39s -> 4834.43s]  This is a shmup.
[4835.07s -> 4836.72s]  This is a shmoop.
[4839.82s -> 4841.10s]  It's a charge shot.
[4841.10s -> 4841.90s]  Oh, fuck.
[4841.90s -> 4842.70s]  Okay, here we go.
[4843.50s -> 4845.47s]  Chris.
[4845.47s -> 4864.40s]  It's time to make a big shot.
[4864.40s -> 4864.90s]  Let's go.
[4868.14s -> 4869.26s]  Spamton Neo.
[4870.40s -> 4871.52s]  Okay, snap.
[4871.52s -> 4872.16s]  Snap all.
[4872.16s -> 4872.96s]  Let's try snap all.
[4874.00s -> 4875.28s]  Everyone snapped wires.
[4876.64s -> 4878.32s]  This isn't spotty, just heavenly.
[4879.68s -> 4881.12s]  This is a fucking banger.
[4882.02s -> 4882.52s]  Got to go up.
[4883.54s -> 4885.49s]  Let's go.
[4886.51s -> 4888.21s]  Three times the firepower,
[4888.21s -> 4889.09s]  two times the waterpower,
[4889.09s -> 4890.05s]  and best of all, flying head.
[4890.85s -> 4896.58s]  All right, get it.
[4897.20s -> 4901.30s]  Hold and release, beat a fire, big shot.
[4902.10s -> 4907.70s]  Again.
[4910.38s -> 4910.88s]  Snap all.
[4911.74s -> 4915.02s]  We'll turn those shmoes and dames
[4915.02s -> 4915.98s]  into a rose and grave.
[4916.86s -> 4917.99s]  Oh, God.
[4918.53s -> 4929.89s]  Bring it on.
[4930.69s -> 4931.19s]  Come on.
[4931.73s -> 4937.02s]  Don't you want to be part of my beautiful heart?
[4937.66s -> 4939.50s]  Or did you need a little special tool?
[4946.02s -> 4947.06s]  I probably shouldn't hit him.
[4947.06s -> 4948.10s]  I don't know if I should be shooting him.
[4948.74s -> 4950.51s]  Isn't that bad?
[4951.39s -> 4953.14s]  I don't think I should shoot him.
[4953.14s -> 4953.86s]  I don't want to shoot him.
[4953.86s -> 4954.36s]  Stop shooting him.
[4955.06s -> 4959.22s]  All right, how are we doing on health?
[4959.86s -> 4964.43s]  Okay, I'm going to use a spaghetti gun.
[4970.77s -> 4971.27s]  Snap.
[4972.29s -> 4978.10s]  All you got to do is go big.
[4978.90s -> 4983.71s]  Are you serious?
[4984.67s -> 4985.31s]  It's for you.
[4994.43s -> 4994.93s]  Ooh.
[4995.47s -> 4998.32s]  Don't let him get in here.
[4998.96s -> 4999.46s]  All right, again.
[5000.40s -> 5000.90s]  Snap all.
[5002.24s -> 5005.78s]  That's calling, Chris.
[5005.78s -> 5006.74s]  My heart, my hand.
[5016.61s -> 5017.11s]  Good.
[5017.17s -> 5018.14s]  You need another heal?
[5018.14s -> 5018.64s]  No, I'm not.
[5018.64s -> 5019.14s]  I'm good.
[5019.14s -> 5025.70s]  Look at my eyes, look at my nose,
[5025.70s -> 5026.26s]  look at my mouth.
[5027.06s -> 5037.78s]  Got to heal.
[5040.96s -> 5043.52s]  We got to do fuck juice on me.
[5044.24s -> 5045.49s]  Everybody heal.
[5046.43s -> 5055.65s]  Everybody take a butt juice.
[5056.37s -> 5056.87s]  Back to full.
[5060.37s -> 5060.87s]  Come on.
[5064.21s -> 5065.01s]  Can't stand it.
[5065.73s -> 5085.28s]  Again.
[5085.74s -> 5086.46s]  What do you have right now?
[5087.58s -> 5088.30s]  Almost halfway there.
[5088.30s -> 5088.80s]  Let's go.
[5089.42s -> 5093.62s]  I got enough heals, I think.
[5094.26s -> 5107.92s]  Again.
[5112.35s -> 5113.15s]  I got to be careful here.
[5113.71s -> 5115.46s]  I got to heal after this.
[5116.10s -> 5126.56s]  All right, heal.
[5127.20s -> 5128.70s]  We're getting code.
[5129.34s -> 5132.21s]  We're getting code twice.
[5139.18s -> 5139.68s]  Go.
[5154.75s -> 5155.25s]  Again.
[5156.21s -> 5159.28s]  All right, only like four or five more times and that's it.
[5160.00s -> 5180.20s]  All right, we got somebody down.
[5180.20s -> 5183.50s]  Revive.
[5184.36s -> 5186.92s]  Revive Mint on Susie.
[5187.72s -> 5194.54s]  Let's go.
[5195.08s -> 5213.80s]  Come on.
[5214.10s -> 5217.25s]  All right, I'm going to fight.
[5217.81s -> 5234.62s]  Pretty bad.
[5235.78s -> 5236.74s]  80 percent.
[5236.74s -> 5237.24s]  Come on.
[5240.04s -> 5241.40s]  All right, so what do we got for health?
[5242.12s -> 5244.52s]  Okay, here's what we're going to do here.
[5246.28s -> 5246.78s]  Seven.
[5247.16s -> 5247.66s]  14.
[5248.76s -> 5249.64s]  Okay, let's go.
[5250.44s -> 5254.31s]  I need to go.
[5254.31s -> 5254.81s]  Where's Ralsei?
[5255.49s -> 5258.07s]  I'm going to revive Mint on Susie.
[5259.03s -> 5267.54s]  And then Ralsei is going to do a heal prayer on Ralsei.
[5268.26s -> 5268.98s]  All right, let's go.
[5269.86s -> 5273.24s]  F1 for help.
[5273.24s -> 5273.88s]  Oh, shit.
[5274.44s -> 5278.64s]  It's for me.
[5279.52s -> 5280.47s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[5280.47s -> 5280.87s]  What's he doing?
[5280.87s -> 5281.37s]  Is he healing?
[5282.23s -> 5284.15s]  It smells like rotten glass.
[5284.79s -> 5289.76s]  Get those fucking wires cut.
[5289.76s -> 5290.26s]  Now.
[5290.48s -> 5297.62s]  Oh, God.
[5299.76s -> 5309.21s]  Whoa.
[5309.99s -> 5316.55s]  Whoa.
[5316.93s -> 5320.08s]  Stage lights are shattered.
[5320.72s -> 5321.68s]  He's almost there.
[5322.24s -> 5322.74s]  This is it.
[5323.60s -> 5327.54s]  Snap it.
[5328.24s -> 5329.49s]  He's right there.
[5346.52s -> 5347.02s]  Help.
[5347.16s -> 5353.72s]  That's it.
[5358.00s -> 5358.64s]  It's over.
[5358.64s -> 5359.14s]  I win.
[5360.68s -> 5361.18s]  That's it.
[5363.60s -> 5367.20s]  Yeah, I'm going to snap the wire on him and then see you later, spare.
[5367.20s -> 5367.70s]  That's it.
[5367.70s -> 5368.20s]  I win.
[5368.64s -> 5376.60s]  Let me make sure it's actually going to work.
[5377.24s -> 5379.22s]  Let's just make sure.
[5380.42s -> 5381.06s]  Yeah, game over.
[5381.06s -> 5381.56s]  I win.
[5381.94s -> 5382.44s]  Get out of here.
[5386.36s -> 5391.54s]  Oh, I got to keep it going.
[5391.54s -> 5395.75s]  I got to first try the secret bosses in every chapter, right?
[5395.75s -> 5396.25s]  I have to.
[5396.55s -> 5402.47s]  What?
[5402.47s -> 5402.97s]  Oh, hold on.
[5427.57s -> 5459.67s]  God, he's just dead.
[5460.31s -> 5465.51s]  Oh, God.
[5465.51s -> 5468.60s]  That's kind of sad.
[5472.05s -> 5478.00s]  It seems after all, I couldn't be anything more than a simple puppet.
[5479.28s -> 5483.84s]  But you three, you're strong with a power like that.
[5484.80s -> 5487.20s]  Maybe you three can break your own strings.
[5488.52s -> 5490.28s]  Let me become your strength.
[5490.28s -> 5497.73s]  You got shadow crystal.
[5497.73s -> 5500.23s]  You got deal maker.
[5500.23s -> 5505.22s]  Oh, I liked him.
[5505.78s -> 5510.58s]  I actually like that guy a lot.
[5510.58s -> 5514.05s]  All right, what is it?
[5514.05s -> 5518.50s]  So we've got deal maker.
[5518.50s -> 5524.74s]  Ooh, fashionable pink and yellow glasses greatly increases money gained and a shit
[5524.74s -> 5525.86s]  lot of other stuff.
[5525.86s -> 5533.62s]  We should probably, Rousey should probably have this, right?
[5534.26s -> 5539.17s]  Yeah, give this to Rousey.
[5542.98s -> 5544.12s]  What was the other thing?
[5544.12s -> 5544.92s]  There was something else, too.
[5545.96s -> 5549.30s]  Wasn't there something else?
[5554.71s -> 5555.67s]  Shadow crystal.
[5555.67s -> 5558.47s]  A sharp shadow moves like water in the hand.
[5558.47s -> 5560.07s]  You have collected one.
[5560.07s -> 5567.20s]  Fun fact, if you beat him with a full inventory,
[5567.20s -> 5568.16s]  he gets really pissed.
[5569.92s -> 5574.48s]  You get the other one from Jevil.
[5574.48s -> 5577.38s]  Oh, well, I did do that.
[5577.38s -> 5578.82s]  It's on a different computer.
[5578.82s -> 5588.16s]  That was really cool.
[5588.16s -> 5588.64s]  That was fun.
[5589.65s -> 5591.89s]  That was a little intense, you know.
[5593.60s -> 5596.56s]  I'm setting myself up for a lot of defeat here
[5597.20s -> 5601.83s]  because I can't just be beat the secret boss Andy on first try.
[5601.83s -> 5603.91s]  I mean, that's not going to happen three times in a row, right?
[5603.91s -> 5604.71s]  Like in no way.
[5605.75s -> 5607.35s]  I feel like that's I'm adding.
[5607.35s -> 5608.71s]  I'm not going to be able to do that.
[5608.71s -> 5610.08s]  I'm going to have to though.
[5610.72s -> 5612.08s]  I have to be like three and oh,
[5617.06s -> 5619.14s]  there's a save game editor for chapter two
[5619.14s -> 5621.06s]  and a chapter one editor is in the works.
[5621.06s -> 5622.74s]  You want to create a single PC save.
[5622.74s -> 5623.46s]  Oh, OK, that's cool.
[5626.44s -> 5627.16s]  Ever a pee break?
[5627.16s -> 5628.28s]  Yeah, it's a good idea.
[5628.28s -> 5629.24s]  Let's take a pee break.
[5629.24s -> 5633.62s]  I'll be right back and we'll continue on in a second.
[5733.94s -> 5734.58s]  Hey, what's up?
[5734.58s -> 5735.38s]  I'm not back yet.
[5735.38s -> 5737.14s]  I'm just letting you know I'm going to be another minute or two
[5737.14s -> 5740.79s]  because I'm making a coffee back in like two more minutes.
[5741.35s -> 6106.24s]  OK, OK, OK, I'm back.
[6106.24s -> 6106.64s]  I'm back.
[6106.64s -> 6107.14s]  Sorry.
[6108.16s -> 6111.60s]  I've made a coffee and that led to me getting a snack,
[6111.60s -> 6114.16s]  which led to me having to like get that right.
[6114.16s -> 6115.20s]  Look, I'm sorry.
[6115.84s -> 6119.36s]  Snack was very good, though.
[6122.56s -> 6125.92s]  It was because of the Duke's sausages.
[6128.47s -> 6129.19s]  They're very good.
[6129.75s -> 6131.59s]  The chorizo and lime Duke sausages.
[6131.59s -> 6132.39s]  Holy moly.
[6132.39s -> 6133.19s]  They're very, very good.
[6133.75s -> 6136.82s]  They're like the little like meat snacks.
[6139.81s -> 6142.37s]  Highly recommend the chorizo and lime if you haven't had it.
[6146.23s -> 6147.51s]  Yeah, this is scary music.
[6148.15s -> 6149.67s]  I didn't even realize that.
[6156.80s -> 6161.67s]  OK, you guys can't see anything, but now you can.
[6162.31s -> 6168.88s]  So let's go back this way that we came.
[6171.59s -> 6172.95s]  Those are dog treats.
[6176.60s -> 6180.16s]  What's going on?
[6180.16s -> 6183.52s]  Hey, so are we seriously not going to talk about any of that?
[6184.32s -> 6185.88s]  It was goddamn weird.
[6186.68s -> 6188.04s]  Puppets, strings, hands.
[6188.04s -> 6189.48s]  What the hell does any of that mean?
[6191.41s -> 6192.45s]  And the way he just broke.
[6193.94s -> 6195.38s]  I don't think it meant anything, Susie.
[6196.20s -> 6198.20s]  It seems like it was just a corrupted program.
[6198.92s -> 6202.13s]  Yeah, I love these things.
[6202.13s -> 6203.25s]  They're really crunchy.
[6203.25s -> 6204.21s]  They're really small.
[6204.77s -> 6205.17s]  I don't know.
[6205.17s -> 6206.77s]  They've made it into some kind of oat milk or something.
[6206.77s -> 6207.57s]  They're called milk bones.
[6208.85s -> 6210.45s]  They're in a weird part of the grocery store, though.
[6210.45s -> 6213.25s]  They're in like the dog aisle, like the pet aisle.
[6213.25s -> 6213.81s]  I don't know why.
[6215.43s -> 6216.07s]  I don't know.
[6216.07s -> 6216.87s]  They're very, very good.
[6217.43s -> 6219.72s]  He turned into our allies.
[6219.72s -> 6220.60s]  Let's just accept it.
[6221.16s -> 6226.68s]  Chris, you've got goosebumps.
[6227.56s -> 6228.04s]  You OK?
[6228.76s -> 6233.43s]  I'm OK.
[6233.43s -> 6239.70s]  If you say it all strained like that, I'm not going to think you're OK.
[6240.50s -> 6242.88s]  Hey, Rousey.
[6242.88s -> 6244.00s]  You think Chris is OK?
[6246.37s -> 6247.81s]  Well, they seem a bit shocked, but
[6248.37s -> 6250.63s]  Chris doesn't want us to worry, so
[6251.27s -> 6254.80s]  let's not push them for now.
[6256.39s -> 6256.87s]  I'm all right.
[6257.43s -> 6259.40s]  Chris, I'll make some cake for you later, OK?
[6259.96s -> 6261.48s]  I could even make it chocolate flavored.
[6262.47s -> 6264.07s]  Butterscotch, simenon, whatever you want.
[6269.35s -> 6272.31s]  Well, their stomach's rumbling, but the goosebumps aren't gone.
[6272.31s -> 6277.88s]  Chris, if you're cold, you can share my scarf.
[6279.03s -> 6282.55s]  Yes, every time I mispronounce a word, everyone has to talk about it.
[6283.19s -> 6285.01s]  Whatever.
[6285.01s -> 6288.60s]  I said simenon instead of simenon.
[6288.60s -> 6289.64s]  It's very easy to do.
[6291.33s -> 6293.01s]  Or Susie could.
[6293.49s -> 6293.73s]  What?
[6293.73s -> 6295.49s]  No hell if I'm giving you my jacket.
[6296.29s -> 6297.17s]  You make me cold.
[6297.17s -> 6298.93s]  I'm burning you knuckleheads for warmth.
[6301.62s -> 6302.10s]  Susie.
[6303.67s -> 6304.23s]  Too late.
[6304.23s -> 6306.39s]  Already imagining you guys as idiot-scented candles.
[6307.35s -> 6310.24s]  You said it wrong?
[6311.60s -> 6313.78s]  Cin- cinnamon.
[6315.43s -> 6315.91s]  Cinnamon.
[6317.48s -> 6318.12s]  Cinnamon.
[6318.12s -> 6318.92s]  What is it?
[6318.92s -> 6319.72s]  It's cinnamon.
[6321.70s -> 6322.26s]  Cinnamon.
[6322.82s -> 6326.52s]  I'm saying right?
[6326.52s -> 6337.28s]  Cinnamon.
[6337.28s -> 6338.16s]  Hup, hup.
[6338.16s -> 6340.39s]  Wait, why am I going that way when I can go this way?
[6347.22s -> 6351.80s]  So, um, where's progression?
[6351.80s -> 6352.68s]  This way?
[6352.68s -> 6354.96s]  I think progression was this way.
[6356.44s -> 6356.68s]  Ow.
[6357.56s -> 6362.24s]  I'm gonna say aluminium.
[6364.93s -> 6365.49s]  Aluminium.
[6366.13s -> 6372.26s]  Hey!
[6372.26s -> 6377.65s]  What if I do it first?
[6378.37s -> 6382.92s]  I win.
[6383.48s -> 6388.56s]  What's the score?
[6406.93s -> 6407.25s]  Right.
[6408.42s -> 6409.14s]  This stuff.
[6409.78s -> 6411.04s]  Okay, the mouse did that.
[6411.04s -> 6412.40s]  All right, should I go- should I go to the second floor?
[6412.40s -> 6413.60s]  Should I- what's over this way?
[6413.60s -> 6414.48s]  I'm gonna go to the second floor.
[6420.80s -> 6421.44s]  Yeah, let's go.
[6422.00s -> 6427.35s]  Oh wait, I thought I was supposed to collect them.
[6429.48s -> 6430.20s]  Whoops.
[6430.20s -> 6431.72s]  It's me being a stupid dummy.
[6431.72s -> 6432.28s]  Whoopsie.
[6433.24s -> 6435.83s]  I wonder how many people turned their volume down
[6435.83s -> 6437.67s]  and just like went to a different stream after that one.
[6438.31s -> 6441.94s]  That's the hacker.
[6442.58s -> 6447.52s]  You know, sometimes when I do that stuff,
[6447.52s -> 6449.60s]  I hope that the person's putting me through a speaker
[6450.24s -> 6452.88s]  and somebody ends up walking in the room that doesn't know,
[6452.88s -> 6455.04s]  doesn't care that they watched this channel.
[6455.04s -> 6456.16s]  They might not know anything about me.
[6456.80s -> 6458.72s]  And they hear that and they just go,
[6458.72s -> 6460.48s]  what are you- what the fuck is- who is that?
[6461.36s -> 6466.84s]  Like if I were to, for instance, go,
[6467.89s -> 6470.37s]  oh, whoopsie daisy, whoopsie doodly doodly.
[6471.01s -> 6473.01s]  One of you- there's 11,000 people here.
[6473.65s -> 6476.21s]  Somebody's like, dad just came in or something,
[6476.21s -> 6477.73s]  or somebody's like roommate just walked in.
[6478.29s -> 6480.69s]  And now they just thought like, what the fuck are you doing?
[6481.80s -> 6483.16s]  There's 11,000 of you here.
[6484.44s -> 6485.88s]  One of you just had a roommate walk in the door.
[6486.52s -> 6497.62s]  Welcome to the second floor dinner party, section A.
[6497.62s -> 6499.38s]  Please help yourself to anybody's food.
[6500.10s -> 6503.16s]  Normally, I'm terrified of mice,
[6503.16s -> 6505.64s]  but it's okay because that one is wearing a wig.
[6505.64s -> 6506.14s]  Okay.
[6509.65s -> 6511.41s]  Hey, it's me, the hacker.
[6511.97s -> 6513.25s]  No one figured it out, but it's me.
[6513.97s -> 6515.65s]  I've been on the download.
[6515.73s -> 6521.72s]  Oh, that really happened to me.
[6521.72s -> 6522.60s]  My roommate is here.
[6527.40s -> 6527.90s]  Mouse?
[6528.36s -> 6531.06s]  This guy keeps telling everyone at the party he's a hacker.
[6531.62s -> 6533.30s]  I don't know what to do with this information.
[6537.01s -> 6537.57s]  Yes, yes.
[6537.57s -> 6538.29s]  Queen is right.
[6538.29s -> 6539.09s]  Send error report.
[6539.09s -> 6539.97s]  Send error report.
[6540.61s -> 6544.52s]  I wouldn't agree more.
[6544.52s -> 6545.40s]  Send error report.
[6545.40s -> 6546.36s]  Send error report.
[6547.88s -> 6551.70s]  Newpert's moving up in the world.
[6555.73s -> 6556.93s]  I am mouse-a-billion.
[6556.93s -> 6559.57s]  I stand leagues and inches above all the other mice.
[6560.21s -> 6562.13s]  Only Newpert remains above me still.
[6564.98s -> 6565.70s]  Eating a wig.
[6574.28s -> 6580.18s]  Whoa.
[6580.18s -> 6580.74s]  I win.
[6589.67s -> 6594.58s]  Let's go this way first.
[6597.14s -> 6597.78s]  First floor.
[6597.78s -> 6598.82s]  No, we don't want that.
[6600.85s -> 6608.52s]  Hey, what's the point of that?
[6611.72s -> 6612.76s]  What's the point of that?
[6613.56s -> 6618.23s]  Room has been closed due to kitchen vermin.
[6618.23s -> 6621.83s]  Room has been closed due to kitchen.
[6621.83s -> 6636.05s]  Okay, so we can only go...
[6636.05s -> 6636.77s]  I guess I can go up.
[6644.07s -> 6644.95s]  Oh me, oh my.
[6644.95s -> 6647.11s]  The kitchen is infested with vermin.
[6647.11s -> 6648.55s]  I knew we should have properly finished
[6648.55s -> 6650.23s]  dumping all the cheese in that alleyway.
[6652.13s -> 6653.25s]  Ouch, ouch.
[6653.25s -> 6654.61s]  The mouse can't get me up here.
[6655.25s -> 6655.97s]  Even if the...
[6655.97s -> 6657.65s]  Ow, stove is burning my feet.
[6661.51s -> 6661.91s]  Mouse!
[6662.71s -> 6664.63s]  And it's not wearing a wig.
[6665.59s -> 6675.92s]  What the hell?
[6675.92s -> 6677.76s]  Mouse wheel spins into you.
[6678.40s -> 6684.66s]  Oh shit, Space Jam came out.
[6686.13s -> 6686.61s]  Wait, did it?
[6693.20s -> 6693.44s]  Did?
[6696.31s -> 6697.43s]  I forgot.
[6697.43s -> 6698.55s]  Did it come out a long time ago?
[6698.55s -> 6699.51s]  It came out like a month ago.
[6700.15s -> 6700.63s]  Oh, it did?
[6701.67s -> 6702.79s]  All right, let's catch X.
[6703.43s -> 6706.26s]  Okay, let's...
[6707.38s -> 6708.10s]  Oh my goodness.
[6710.15s -> 6710.65s]  Ooh.
[6711.93s -> 6713.61s]  Rolling around at the speed of mouse.
[6714.57s -> 6717.29s]  That's cool.
[6717.85s -> 6718.97s]  Do it again, do it again, do it again.
[6723.50s -> 6723.74s]  What?
[6726.71s -> 6727.75s]  Rickin don't...
[6727.75s -> 6728.63s]  I don't even want to say that.
[6734.33s -> 6735.05s]  Oh, that's weird.
[6736.01s -> 6737.40s]  This is patting your head
[6737.40s -> 6738.60s]  and rubbing your belly at the same time.
[6739.32s -> 6749.16s]  All right, I got one more.
[6751.48s -> 6755.19s]  I think this is the play here.
[6755.91s -> 6757.64s]  Okay, this is the play.
[6758.28s -> 6759.37s]  We're on the edges.
[6761.10s -> 6762.54s]  Big Chungus is in it.
[6766.04s -> 6767.64s]  I hope that's not fake.
[6767.64s -> 6768.84s]  I hope that's not a lie.
[6770.49s -> 6772.17s]  Big Chungus is in it.
[6773.90s -> 6775.50s]  Yeah, fucking right.
[6775.50s -> 6776.94s]  What the fuck?
[6776.94s -> 6778.14s]  We'll take care of it from here.
[6782.01s -> 6783.29s]  He's actually in it.
[6783.29s -> 6783.85s]  No, he's not.
[6785.13s -> 6787.85s]  Big Chungus is not in the Space Jam movie.
[6792.26s -> 6793.46s]  They're not lying for once.
[6801.48s -> 6802.20s]  Thanks for the help.
[6802.20s -> 6804.20s]  We'll open up the East Dining Hall now.
[6806.04s -> 6807.98s]  Thank you.
[6807.98s -> 6808.46s]  Look it up.
[6808.46s -> 6809.50s]  I'm not looking it up, I don't care.
[6810.30s -> 6810.70s]  I'm gonna...
[6811.34s -> 6812.22s]  If I look it up, it's real.
[6812.78s -> 6814.14s]  It's not real right now for me.
[6814.14s -> 6815.82s]  If I look it up and I see it, it's real.
[6815.82s -> 6816.62s]  It's not real for me.
[6816.62s -> 6817.02s]  I'm sorry.
[6817.90s -> 6825.48s]  All right, East Dining Hall.
[6825.48s -> 6828.68s]  It would be this way.
[6832.82s -> 6836.73s]  Oh, we need a stream reaction.
[6837.45s -> 6838.73s]  No, I don't care.
[6838.73s -> 6847.16s]  I feel like I'm trying to scan everything
[6847.16s -> 6848.28s]  because I don't want to miss anything.
[6853.37s -> 6853.93s]  It's locked.
[6854.49s -> 6856.25s]  What's with this giant empty room anyway?
[6856.97s -> 6858.73s]  Welcome to my extravagant dining potential.
[6859.37s -> 6860.76s]  Dear.
[6861.48s -> 6863.88s]  Only one of these delicious platters has the key.
[6864.60s -> 6867.64s]  I am sure searching will be an addicting game of chance.
[6868.44s -> 6869.94s]  Are we going to search all these?
[6872.60s -> 6873.40s]  If I get it first drive,
[6873.40s -> 6875.00s]  then you have to give me 50,000 community subs.
[6875.64s -> 6886.60s]  Oh, key not found.
[6887.32s -> 6888.28s]  Did you mean give up?
[6889.00s -> 6892.94s]  All the platters got mixed up again.
[6893.66s -> 6897.37s]  I didn't say to the debt.
[6897.37s -> 6899.69s]  I said I get 50,000 community subs.
[6899.69s -> 6899.93s]  Not...
[6900.73s -> 6901.77s]  That was the only thing.
[6901.77s -> 6903.05s]  There was nothing else for it.
[6903.61s -> 6904.49s]  All right, it's gonna be this one.
[6905.53s -> 6909.83s]  There's something under this one.
[6912.65s -> 6914.41s]  Oh, it's a dog.
[6914.97s -> 6918.94s]  Hey, wait a sec.
[6919.50s -> 6931.29s]  What's going on?
[6933.64s -> 6945.16s]  Oh, you win.
[6945.96s -> 6946.84s]  Now we just have to...
[6947.80s -> 6949.69s]  It broke it.
[6951.29s -> 6952.79s]  What the fuck?
[6957.00s -> 6958.12s]  Oh, that was awesome.
[6958.76s -> 6961.67s]  Maybe minus the blatant destruction.
[6962.47s -> 6963.51s]  Let's go, Chris.
[6963.51s -> 6964.95s]  We're almost at the third floor.
[6971.03s -> 6973.03s]  No, where's my secret?
[6973.03s -> 6975.19s]  Where's my funny joke that's supposed to be in here?
[6978.65s -> 6979.61s]  Supreme table.
[6980.17s -> 6983.30s]  You won't be able to use this without the throne of the gods.
[6984.10s -> 6987.11s]  It's your cousin.
[6987.11s -> 6987.59s]  Stop.
[6988.39s -> 6989.51s]  That's not what I was doing.
[6991.42s -> 6993.98s]  I can't sit at this unless I have the throne of the gods.
[6993.98s -> 6995.66s]  Why is it a giant gerbil feeder?
[7008.52s -> 7009.40s]  All right, so let's go...
[7012.60s -> 7013.48s]  Let's keel down.
[7014.36s -> 7016.10s]  Let's keel down this one.
[7016.74s -> 7019.53s]  Holdify.
[7020.74s -> 7021.62s]  And then we're going to...
[7022.98s -> 7023.94s]  No, we're not.
[7023.94s -> 7025.70s]  They're not going to do that.
[7025.70s -> 7026.66s]  Here's what we're going to do.
[7027.30s -> 7029.54s]  What we're going to do is we're going to warmify this one.
[7030.26s -> 7031.78s]  And then we're going to keelify.
[7033.18s -> 7033.66s]  All right.
[7033.66s -> 7035.26s]  Is warm red...
[7035.26s -> 7036.46s]  This would be warm this one.
[7036.46s -> 7039.26s]  And then you spare this one.
[7039.98s -> 7048.97s]  I mean, no.
[7048.97s -> 7049.45s]  I got it.
[7065.08s -> 7066.12s]  Got a dabbing.
[7066.84s -> 7068.79s]  That's still a thing, people think.
[7068.79s -> 7069.91s]  You're not still doing that, right?
[7071.35s -> 7071.85s]  Are you?
[7095.43s -> 7096.15s]  Glow shard.
[7096.87s -> 7107.24s]  Where is it?
[7107.24s -> 7110.30s]  Oh, it's here.
[7111.02s -> 7111.66s]  Shimmering shard.
[7111.66s -> 7113.42s]  Its value increases each chapter.
[7114.22s -> 7115.72s]  Damn.
[7121.53s -> 7133.54s]  Chout.
[7133.54s -> 7135.69s]  Oh, God.
[7136.39s -> 7138.82s]  Hey, hey.
[7138.82s -> 7139.32s]  Chout.
[7140.31s -> 7140.81s]  Chout.
[7141.21s -> 7153.28s]  I thought I was supposed to collect them.
[7153.28s -> 7153.78s]  They're blue.
[7154.64s -> 7156.25s]  They're a different color.
[7156.89s -> 7164.54s]  What was that?
[7164.54s -> 7165.82s]  It's chocolate milk.
[7177.23s -> 7177.95s]  Chris.
[7177.95s -> 7178.51s]  Susan.
[7178.51s -> 7180.03s]  Glad to see you arrive unwounded.
[7180.91s -> 7182.35s]  Now let us hasten.
[7185.26s -> 7187.34s]  Here is a secret passageway to the roof.
[7188.65s -> 7192.33s]  There we can in-rescue-ify Lady Noelle.
[7194.12s -> 7194.62s]  Okay.
[7195.24s -> 7197.36s]  Let's go, Chris.
[7199.95s -> 7200.67s]  Oh, Chris.
[7201.23s -> 7201.73s]  Chris is...
[7202.76s -> 7205.32s]  Chris, you and your lackey distract the queen.
[7206.65s -> 7208.01s]  Let's go, Susie.
[7208.01s -> 7209.21s]  Just the two of us.
[7209.21s -> 7209.71s]  Ha ha ha.
[7211.64s -> 7212.14s]  Fine.
[7212.14s -> 7212.64s]  Whatever.
[7216.92s -> 7218.76s]  Chris, do you think of me as your lackey?
[7221.66s -> 7222.16s]  You mean...
[7222.70s -> 7224.30s]  You think of me as more than a lackey?
[7225.02s -> 7226.98s]  Wait, what?
[7227.52s -> 7227.92s]  Yes.
[7227.92s -> 7228.56s]  I mean, what do you know?
[7228.56s -> 7229.06s]  What are you talking about?
[7229.76s -> 7235.37s]  You're filled with the power of book holes.
[7235.93s -> 7244.03s]  There's a book here about preventing backtracking.
[7247.72s -> 7248.44s]  All right, can I...
[7248.44s -> 7248.68s]  Is there...
[7248.68s -> 7249.18s]  Can I...
[7249.48s -> 7250.36s]  What should I do?
[7250.36s -> 7251.72s]  I'm gonna go this way first.
[7251.72s -> 7254.08s]  What is this?
[7254.08s -> 7258.22s]  The knight created the fountain and this world.
[7258.86s -> 7260.96s]  It might be even more powerful than Queen.
[7262.19s -> 7262.69s]  Now.
[7265.05s -> 7267.45s]  Queen has been very interested in this video recently.
[7268.17s -> 7270.57s]  Where the knight creates the fountain by its own hand.
[7271.29s -> 7274.73s]  Well, it's that and Cyber City's funniest home videos.
[7275.53s -> 7279.88s]  This is today's dinner entertainment.
[7280.44s -> 7282.52s]  I've heard it's called The Birth of a Fountain.
[7283.08s -> 7284.04s]  What an elegant name.
[7285.69s -> 7286.41s]  Elegantly...
[7287.05s -> 7287.85s]  Soiatic.
[7291.13s -> 7294.49s]  We are often forced to star in those videos.
[7295.37s -> 7297.37s]  For now.
[7297.37s -> 7301.28s]  A video of someone creating a strange pillar of smoke.
[7301.84s -> 7303.74s]  There's so much smoke.
[7303.74s -> 7305.02s]  It's hard to tell who it is.
[7305.82s -> 7321.45s]  Statue of Birdly is wedged in the toilet.
[7321.45s -> 7324.17s]  You glance back at the bathroom door sign.
[7324.17s -> 7326.89s]  The sign is a silhouette of a Birdly statue.
[7327.53s -> 7328.41s]  Everything checks out.
[7329.21s -> 7330.51s]  No problem here.
[7331.15s -> 7335.02s]  Oh god, not this guy again.
[7335.66s -> 7338.65s]  What are they gonna be done in there?
[7346.30s -> 7347.74s]  A giant lake of acid?
[7349.07s -> 7350.35s]  Oh, you mean the free pool.
[7351.15s -> 7352.75s]  You will learn to love it like family.
[7353.63s -> 7355.15s]  Why do you have this?
[7355.95s -> 7358.89s]  It is my mansion's energy source and fun to drink.
[7360.54s -> 7361.50s]  Bye!
[7361.50s -> 7368.01s]  How should we pass this?
[7368.01s -> 7377.16s]  I suppose this works.
[7380.72s -> 7389.18s]  Now I have to think of a way to distract the queen.
[7389.82s -> 7391.42s]  Oh, I'm so distracted right now.
[7392.30s -> 7393.82s]  Can I like get out on that?
[7393.82s -> 7402.88s]  Turning them blue.
[7402.88s -> 7407.12s]  What are these little houses?
[7409.00s -> 7410.92s]  Just tropical villas for my guest.
[7410.92s -> 7411.88s]  Isn't that thoughtful?
[7412.60s -> 7414.62s]  How would anybody fit inside?
[7415.88s -> 7417.08s]  Shrink from the acid!
[7417.80s -> 7419.72s]  Chris, get the banana!
[7420.99s -> 7422.43s]  Chris isn't going to do what you say.
[7423.07s -> 7424.84s]  Where's the banana?
[7425.40s -> 7430.30s]  That's okay, Chris.
[7430.30s -> 7430.94s]  It's good for you.
[7431.74s -> 7443.55s]  Did I not turn the other one blue?
[7444.19s -> 7445.31s]  So we're coming up on a tunnel.
[7446.65s -> 7447.77s]  Oh, I didn't turn the other one blue.
[7447.77s -> 7448.09s]  How?
[7448.09s -> 7449.05s]  I thought I could...
[7449.05s -> 7450.17s]  I thought I'd just drive by them.
[7457.61s -> 7460.94s]  There's something blocking the way.
[7460.94s -> 7463.84s]  I can find some way to get rid of this.
[7464.56s -> 7466.73s]  Giant hand.
[7467.37s -> 7467.93s]  Okay.
[7467.93s -> 7475.05s]  Hey, what's over here?
[7475.77s -> 7480.52s]  Nothing.
[7480.52s -> 7487.76s]  Oh, shit.
[7488.88s -> 7490.81s]  Um, okay.
[7492.09s -> 7493.69s]  This one's gonna be here a fucking long time.
[7497.00s -> 7499.32s]  This castle looks like it has worn many sieges.
[7500.28s -> 7507.00s]  Wait, you can just do this.
[7507.56s -> 7511.28s]  What's a...
[7511.28s -> 7512.00s]  Wait, doesn't she have...
[7512.00s -> 7512.40s]  Oh, no.
[7512.40s -> 7514.00s]  That's mist rain or something, right?
[7514.00s -> 7515.04s]  Wait, why do you know you don't have it?
[7515.92s -> 7518.51s]  Where's mist healing mist?
[7518.51s -> 7518.99s]  Oh, shit.
[7518.99s -> 7519.55s]  Wrong person.
[7520.27s -> 7523.76s]  It's in the well.
[7524.48s -> 7534.81s]  Oh, it wasn't yellow.
[7537.28s -> 7537.92s]  Oh, that's right.
[7537.92s -> 7539.04s]  Pacify on the blue.
[7539.04s -> 7546.62s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[7546.62s -> 7546.86s]  I...
[7546.86s -> 7548.62s]  It's been a while since I've had to pacify somebody.
[7555.13s -> 7555.53s]  Ah!
[7556.41s -> 7581.20s]  He's losing it.
[7581.84s -> 7583.08s]  Okay, it seems...
[7583.08s -> 7584.84s]  It seems that peace has returned to the castle.
[7585.56s -> 7588.08s]  You opened and got a revive dust.
[7588.72s -> 7592.14s]  Revive dust was added to your item inventory.
[7597.28s -> 7610.40s]  No, I don't wanna.
[7611.20s -> 7649.06s]  Uh-oh.
[7650.80s -> 7669.24s]  Let me just click off out of the window
[7669.24s -> 7670.44s]  in a place I'm not supposed to click.
[7671.08s -> 7673.36s]  Uh-oh.
[7673.98s -> 7675.39s]  Uh-oh.
[7675.39s -> 7675.79s]  All right.
[7675.79s -> 7678.91s]  Let me just see if I can get over on my fucking Mac.
[7678.91s -> 7679.31s]  Let me just...
[7679.31s -> 7679.71s]  Uh-oh.
[7679.71s -> 7680.11s]  Uh-oh.
[7680.11s -> 7680.19s]  Uh-oh.
[7680.19s -> 7680.51s]  Uh-oh.
[7680.51s -> 7680.83s]  Uh-oh.
[7680.83s -> 7681.15s]  Uh-oh.
[7681.15s -> 7682.19s]  Oh, whatever.
[7682.19s -> 7682.51s]  I can't...
[7682.51s -> 7683.71s]  I think my computer's frozen.
[7688.12s -> 7692.88s]  I'm supposed to do this.
[7693.84s -> 7700.96s]  How do I get that?
[7700.96s -> 7701.92s]  Because I have to do this up.
[7702.72s -> 7705.37s]  Can I go up from here?
[7705.37s -> 7705.61s]  No.
[7705.61s -> 7706.57s]  How am I supposed to get this?
[7709.55s -> 7710.43s]  Oh my god.
[7711.07s -> 7712.03s]  What a dummy.
[7713.15s -> 7721.16s]  What was that?
[7726.91s -> 7727.31s]  You all right?
[7729.39s -> 7732.72s]  Is this guy...
[7732.72s -> 7734.08s]  Did I talk to this guy or is he gonna fight me?
[7735.23s -> 7736.03s]  Thank you for your help.
[7736.67s -> 7739.63s]  I had gone up there to do a little house cleaning and got stuck.
[7743.84s -> 7744.16s]  Thank you.
[7747.32s -> 7749.92s]  Um...
[7750.86s -> 7762.92s]  I suppose we'll just have to let it go this once.
[7763.80s -> 7771.34s]  How do I...
[7771.34s -> 7771.82s]  Can I...
[7771.82s -> 7772.54s]  Um, okay.
[7773.58s -> 7773.98s]  Is that it?
[7774.78s -> 7786.27s]  I can't get over that way?
[7786.83s -> 7788.76s]  All right.
[7789.40s -> 7793.87s]  He doesn't do anything.
[7794.75s -> 7803.10s]  I don't...
[7803.10s -> 7803.74s]  I don't remember...
[7803.74s -> 7804.22s]  I don't know how to...
[7804.22s -> 7804.86s]  I don't know.
[7804.86s -> 7805.58s]  I don't know how to do it.
[7806.38s -> 7807.10s]  No, I'm done.
[7807.10s -> 7807.58s]  I'm done.
[7807.58s -> 7807.90s]  I don't...
[7807.90s -> 7808.62s]  I don't know how to...
[7808.62s -> 7808.94s]  I'm done.
[7810.06s -> 7811.02s]  Yeah, I'm fucking done.
[7811.02s -> 7811.34s]  I'm done.
[7811.34s -> 7812.14s]  Whatever.
[7812.14s -> 7812.78s]  This game's like...
[7812.78s -> 7813.26s]  Whatever.
[7813.26s -> 7814.70s]  It's like just fucking two artists and shit.
[7814.70s -> 7815.18s]  It's stupid.
[7815.90s -> 7816.54s]  No, I'm done.
[7816.54s -> 7816.86s]  I'm done.
[7817.90s -> 7818.38s]  That's done.
[7818.38s -> 7819.26s]  I'm done.
[7819.26s -> 7819.90s]  I don't want to do this.
[7823.04s -> 7824.70s]  But what about this over here?
[7825.58s -> 7826.78s]  Gamer rage.
[7826.86s -> 7830.06s]  Dear guests, please note our mice will turn at every crossing.
[7830.70s -> 7833.34s]  Our vermin have been specifically hand picked for higher turning.
[7833.98s -> 7840.44s]  I found one dollar.
[7840.44s -> 7841.40s]  You didn't get any.
[7841.96s -> 7842.68s]  What the fuck?
[7847.15s -> 7848.51s]  No, I don't want to...
[7852.40s -> 7853.04s]  No!
[7853.04s -> 7854.24s]  They found 20 dollars.
[7854.88s -> 7870.67s]  Sounds like the bridge was raised.
[7878.44s -> 7879.24s]  Drop that.
[7879.24s -> 7879.96s]  Ah, it's gonna clap.
[7880.92s -> 7888.52s]  Looks like the hand is out of the way now.
[7889.08s -> 7900.83s]  Let's go.
[7906.36s -> 7907.72s]  Sound of progress, my friend.
[7914.51s -> 7915.07s]  Chris.
[7915.07s -> 7915.55s]  Hey, Chris.
[7916.67s -> 7920.59s]  Is it strange to say it's nice spending time alone with you like this?
[7930.88s -> 7931.68s]  I like hanging out.
[7931.68s -> 7932.64s]  I like spending time.
[7934.49s -> 7938.30s]  But I wouldn't say it's necessarily strange.
[7938.30s -> 7939.34s]  What do you mean strange?
[7949.15s -> 7950.03s]  I like hanging out.
[7950.91s -> 7953.58s]  I'm happy to hear you say that, Chris.
[7953.58s -> 7957.26s]  When we first met, I was so nervous about first impressions.
[7960.41s -> 7962.25s]  I even hid my face so you wouldn't see.
[7964.73s -> 7966.09s]  How do I even be a friend?
[7966.89s -> 7969.13s]  All I have to do is be nice is what I thought.
[7969.93s -> 7973.37s]  But I'm starting to realize being friends is more than that, isn't it?
[7974.67s -> 7975.47s]  Susie.
[7975.47s -> 7976.83s]  Sometimes she isn't nice at all.
[7977.63s -> 7978.27s]  She's selfish.
[7978.27s -> 7978.83s]  She's rude.
[7978.83s -> 7979.63s]  She's sarcastic.
[7980.99s -> 7983.79s]  But isn't it wonderful that she's her?
[7985.15s -> 7986.75s]  Is what I started thinking today.
[7987.87s -> 7989.87s]  Of course, Chris, it's nice that you're you.
[7995.42s -> 8003.12s]  Just so I could like dot dot dot.
[8003.12s -> 8004.64s]  That's not as rude.
[8005.28s -> 8006.32s]  It's nice that you're...
[8008.08s -> 8011.12s]  Yeah, it's nice that Rousey is Rousey.
[8011.68s -> 8020.22s]  But I'm I just wanted I'm really trying to pay attention to the to the dark ride we're on.
[8020.86s -> 8022.86s]  I know that like Mickey Mouse is going to jump out a few times.
[8024.22s -> 8026.54s]  Can we talk about this after the ride?
[8026.54s -> 8027.04s]  Huh?
[8027.82s -> 8029.18s]  No one's ever said that to me before.
[8032.46s -> 8035.50s]  I mean, everything's a first for me.
[8035.50s -> 8041.69s]  But hearing it from you, it means a lot.
[8044.00s -> 8047.12s]  I just wonder what being Rousey-like even is.
[8047.12s -> 8050.99s]  Well, that is for you to decide, Rousey.
[8051.07s -> 8055.15s]  As we asked enough of me to decide this for you to decide.
[8055.15s -> 8056.99s]  Sorry, I got off track and I just I missed it.
[8057.55s -> 8058.11s]  I missed it.
[8059.15s -> 8061.23s]  We turned the corner and fucking Ursula showed up.
[8061.23s -> 8062.83s]  And I wanted to see Ursula.
[8062.83s -> 8064.19s]  Okay, I missed it.
[8065.15s -> 8066.19s]  Let's just enjoy the ride.
[8066.19s -> 8066.51s]  Yeah.
[8066.51s -> 8067.01s]  Okay.
[8078.64s -> 8080.40s]  Wow, Chris, look at all those houses.
[8080.40s -> 8085.60s]  I wonder what will happen if we change their color.
[8088.24s -> 8089.84s]  Boused worms really slottest.
[8090.86s -> 8094.30s]  Mouse had seen the last of me.
[8094.30s -> 8094.80s]  Oh, no.
[8096.57s -> 8097.37s]  It's Captain...
[8098.09s -> 8098.89s]  I don't know this guy's name.
[8100.16s -> 8101.92s]  Chips ahoyeth, landlubbers.
[8104.32s -> 8107.04s]  Tothouth readyeth to visit David Jones' locker.
[8107.68s -> 8110.54s]  Would you not speak with more than one accent?
[8111.98s -> 8112.54s]  Yes.
[8112.54s -> 8113.04s]  All right.
[8114.40s -> 8116.08s]  Oh, Mr. Rules.
[8116.96s -> 8118.65s]  I just remembered Lancer.
[8118.65s -> 8119.53s]  He's not well.
[8121.04s -> 8121.92s]  Oh, dear.
[8121.92s -> 8124.00s]  Dinist Hower and Triumph burping him.
[8124.96s -> 8128.00s]  Perhaps I'll give them a sip of my ginger ale.
[8128.00s -> 8133.76s]  Oh, wait, I have more time to spare on such frivolities.
[8133.76s -> 8137.72s]  I must just conquer this island and defeat myself.
[8137.72s -> 8139.48s]  Then, I'm doing Captain Crunch.
[8139.48s -> 8141.40s]  It's not a bad accent, it's Captain Crunch.
[8141.40s -> 8145.93s]  Then gifting her a succulent island present,
[8145.93s -> 8148.93s]  the beautiesque queen shall reward me
[8148.93s -> 8152.63s]  by making me her left-hand man.
[8152.63s -> 8154.91s]  Ah-ha-ha, me the ultimate minion.
[8154.91s -> 8160.47s]  Now beholdeth the formeth of thou destroyer.
[8160.47s -> 8165.31s]  Wherever this thing is, this again.
[8165.31s -> 8169.11s]  Ah-ha, squirming jealousy at my battle caravan
[8169.11s -> 8173.83s]  is an effigy of an ancient god of combating.
[8173.83s -> 8177.79s]  I rescued this from the king's trap
[8177.79s -> 8182.29s]  and fixed it up in this world of scraps up.
[8182.29s -> 8187.49s]  It's actually a rejected design we made.
[8187.49s -> 8189.17s]  Oh, this is your creation normally, right?
[8189.17s -> 8191.20s]  OK, yeah, that's fine.
[8191.20s -> 8194.48s]  And soon, thou shalt taste this rejection,
[8194.48s -> 8199.30s]  first this in the form of various bullets.
[8199.30s -> 8201.88s]  Trash machine reluctantly fights you.
[8201.88s -> 8203.32s]  Oh, hold on a second, Goku.
[8203.32s -> 8205.04s]  Let me go ahead and tell you how to play.
[8205.04s -> 8206.96s]  I know, I know, I was supposed to tell you.
[8206.96s -> 8209.94s]  I'm just doing, like, the end of the episode thing.
[8209.94s -> 8212.46s]  Wow, I wonder what's going to happen next time.
[8212.46s -> 8214.46s]  These two guys are spiting each other.
[8214.46s -> 8215.34s]  I wonder what happens.
[8215.34s -> 8217.86s]  Hey, hey, hey, save me a piece.
[8217.86s -> 8219.78s]  They're always, like, eating food, right?
[8219.78s -> 8222.52s]  They're always, like, talking to somebody off screen.
[8222.52s -> 8224.12s]  I wonder what's going to happen next time
[8224.12s -> 8226.52s]  machine reluctancy fighting for you.
[8226.52s -> 8228.80s]  Hey, wait up for me.

[8237.57s -> 8247.64s]  Take house two.
[8247.64s -> 8252.12s]  Take house, take house, take house three.
[8252.12s -> 8253.84s]  Oh, man, what am I doing?
[8253.84s -> 8256.80s]  We're claiming tile, claim you can take this tile.
[8256.80s -> 8262.37s]  Oh, fuck, I don't know what I'm doing.
[8262.37s -> 8265.66s]  Claim this house and this one.
[8265.66s -> 8267.26s]  Oh, shit, it's one of those things.
[8267.26s -> 8269.24s]  Oops.
[8269.24s -> 8271.80s]  The rules, pronounced rules, are simple.
[8271.80s -> 8277.56s]  Hunker houses, whoever has the most wins.
[8277.56s -> 8279.00s]  I wasn't ready for them.
[8279.00s -> 8285.04s]  Ow.
[8285.04s -> 8287.60s]  Take house four.
[8287.60s -> 8291.24s]  Take house two.
[8291.24s -> 8301.43s]  You distract.

[8305.36s -> 8306.60s]  House distracted.
[8306.60s -> 8312.73s]  Rules will place one less house next turn.
[8312.73s -> 8314.09s]  I have to go down, as I'm going.
[8314.09s -> 8323.42s]  Yeah, yeah, I'm going down.
[8323.42s -> 8325.70s]  We're going to take two houses.
[8325.70s -> 8327.10s]  We need TP?
[8327.10s -> 8328.82s]  Oh.
[8328.86s -> 8334.85s]  Shut up, what am I doing?
[8334.85s -> 8346.90s]  What happens if we win?
[8346.90s -> 8349.36s]  Shit.
[8349.36s -> 8354.64s]  We're going to take four houses.
[8354.64s -> 8356.07s]  Sorry.
[8356.07s -> 8363.34s]  Fuck, dear.
[8363.34s -> 8364.54s]  Stop, stop, stop building houses.
[8364.54s -> 8373.28s]  I have to win.
[8373.28s -> 8388.50s]  Wait, it's not a connect four?
[8388.50s -> 8397.24s]  What do I have?
[8397.24s -> 8404.20s]  Oh, this dude's a moron.
[8404.20s -> 8405.56s]  I mean, he's, I'm winning.
[8405.56s -> 8410.31s]  What are you talking about?
[8410.31s -> 8411.15s]  You're a dumbass.
[8411.15s -> 8412.03s]  Look, I'm supposed to claim,
[8412.03s -> 8414.97s]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[8414.97s -> 8416.61s]  Kiwi Herman scream.
[8416.61s -> 8418.33s]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[8418.33s -> 8419.69s]  Fuck, I tried.
[8419.97s -> 8421.89s]  I only had a half a second to do that.
[8421.89s -> 8424.57s]  I only had a half a second to get that out.
[8424.57s -> 8426.01s]  I didn't get like 10 minutes in a booth
[8426.01s -> 8427.21s]  getting prepared, okay?
[8432.51s -> 8443.37s]  I'm winning.
[8443.37s -> 8460.70s]  I'm winning, I think.
[8460.70s -> 8472.92s]  I win.
[8472.92s -> 8475.47s]  Because, yeah, one, two.
[8489.18s -> 8490.30s]  I won.
[8490.30s -> 8491.90s]  Seems the game has been over.
[8491.90s -> 8494.32s]  I win.
[8494.32s -> 8495.16s]  What?
[8495.16s -> 8497.52s]  How's doth hath more houses?
[8497.52s -> 8499.27s]  Cut the battle.
[8499.27s -> 8500.47s]  You won.
[8500.47s -> 8502.08s]  Yet, I won.
[8502.08s -> 8507.22s]  Yeah, you guys are freaking out for no reason.
[8507.22s -> 8512.84s]  You guys are freaking out for no reason.
[8512.84s -> 8514.40s]  Ah, ah, ah.
[8514.40s -> 8516.62s]  So thou hast triumphed.
[8516.62s -> 8517.70s]  Not you have only seen,
[8517.70s -> 8522.24s]  but one percentile of my weapons abilities.
[8522.24s -> 8524.34s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[8524.34s -> 8528.26s]  Behold, worm, the real power of Rulf card.
[8532.62s -> 8535.62s]  God.
[8538.44s -> 8540.72s]  You won by one.
[8540.72s -> 8544.42s]  I still won.
[8544.42s -> 8547.21s]  Look, if I'm in first place,
[8547.21s -> 8548.41s]  say we're like running a marathon.
[8548.41s -> 8550.77s]  I'm in first place, you're in second place.
[8550.77s -> 8552.94s]  And I'm way ahead of you.
[8552.94s -> 8554.89s]  I'm like 200,
[8554.89s -> 8558.24s]  I'd like, let's say I'm 100 fucking yards ahead of you.
[8558.88s -> 8560.86s]  And I fall down.
[8560.86s -> 8563.74s]  I trip, I fall, I've scraped my knee.
[8563.74s -> 8566.00s]  I roll three times, I get up.
[8566.00s -> 8568.28s]  A bird flies in my face, hits me in the head.
[8568.28s -> 8569.36s]  Like a bird shits on me.
[8569.36s -> 8571.28s]  I stop for a minute.
[8571.28s -> 8574.56s]  As long as I cross the finish line before you do,
[8574.56s -> 8576.60s]  I won the game, I won.
[8576.60s -> 8580.50s]  So what do you care?
[8580.50s -> 8583.70s]  I can literally sit down and watch you running towards me.
[8583.70s -> 8586.22s]  Just sit down with my legs kind of just crossed,
[8586.22s -> 8588.70s]  sitting there waiting for you for a hundred more yards.
[8588.70s -> 8590.22s]  Get up and cross the finish line.
[8590.22s -> 8593.48s]  I will still win the race.
[8593.48s -> 8603.05s]  It doesn't matter how I did it, I came in first.
[8603.05s -> 8604.85s]  This is a bad analogy, how?
[8604.85s -> 8607.29s]  It's just, if you cross the finish line before somebody else,
[8607.29s -> 8615.03s]  you won, it doesn't matter how you got there.
[8615.03s -> 8619.26s]  That's right, rules isn't compatible with this world either.
[8624.40s -> 8625.80s]  Well, let's go, Chris.
[8625.80s -> 8628.59s]  You cheated.
[8628.59s -> 8630.76s]  Oh, I cheated?
[8630.76s -> 8631.60s]  Yeah, fine.
[8631.60s -> 8633.48s]  Let's both do a blood test.
[8633.48s -> 8634.32s]  Okay, fine.
[8634.32s -> 8643.11s]  Let's both do a blood test and see what's going on.
[8643.11s -> 8649.25s]  Looks like the right, oh, it's a good picture.
[8649.25s -> 8651.21s]  There's a camera, it's gonna take a picture.
[8651.21s -> 8653.44s]  Should we pose?
[8653.44s -> 8657.73s]  E-sign, rude gesture.
[8657.73s -> 8660.81s]  No, the play, you guys, the play with these things is you,
[8660.81s -> 8662.96s]  I try to do this every time.
[8662.96s -> 8666.63s]  So you try to figure out where it is.
[8666.63s -> 8668.19s]  And then, I don't know, I sometimes do that.
[8668.19s -> 8673.63s]  I try to pretend to be asleep or pretend to be crying.
[8673.63s -> 8675.91s]  Like with a horrible, like I'm fucking bawling
[8675.91s -> 8683.28s]  or just like I'm passed out, like my head over.
[8683.28s -> 8684.80s]  Rude gesture.
[8684.80s -> 8693.33s]  Oh, I'm gonna give it like the finger hug.
[8693.33s -> 8698.92s]  I don't know if I would do that.
[8698.92s -> 8700.60s]  I honestly, if I would probably,
[8700.60s -> 8703.64s]  I would probably either pretend to be asleep
[8703.64s -> 8706.33s]  or that I wouldn't like,
[8706.33s -> 8711.73s]  I wouldn't grab the person next to me and hug them.
[8711.73s -> 8718.43s]  I would give like the peace sign
[8718.43s -> 8721.35s]  or I would give a rude, all right, let's do rude gesture.
[8723.56s -> 8724.40s]  What am I doing?
[8724.40s -> 8727.23s]  Wait, what is he doing?
[8727.23s -> 8732.34s]  Wait, what, what the hell was that?
[8732.34s -> 8733.78s]  What the hell just happened?
[8733.78s -> 8738.37s]  What has happened?
[8738.37s -> 8739.77s]  You know what's kinda funny?
[8739.77s -> 8743.17s]  There are some people that if a camera,
[8743.17s -> 8745.25s]  they go into like a weird trance.
[8745.25s -> 8749.76s]  If a camera exists, they'll just give it the finger.
[8749.76s -> 8751.72s]  Do you guys know anybody like that in your life
[8751.72s -> 8755.12s]  where it just takes them over?
[8755.12s -> 8757.04s]  It's just like, oh yeah, here comes a picture.
[8757.04s -> 8758.04s]  Yeah, finger.
[8758.04s -> 8760.32s]  It's like, why do you have to do that?
[8760.32s -> 8764.24s]  It takes over their brain.
[8764.24s -> 8765.92s]  It's almost like the person doesn't really know
[8765.92s -> 8769.08s]  what to do with their body or with their arms or hands.
[8769.08s -> 8773.76s]  So like raising up a middle finger is enough of a,
[8773.76s -> 8775.44s]  like, hey, look, emotional, emotion.
[8775.44s -> 8776.40s]  I'm like, look at what I'm doing.
[8776.40s -> 8777.24s]  I don't know.
[8777.24s -> 8778.40s]  It's like there's some people that just snap
[8778.40s -> 8782.81s]  when a camera turns on.
[8783.65s -> 8784.69s]  If you go to like their,
[8784.69s -> 8785.93s]  like let's say you check out,
[8785.93s -> 8787.85s]  like, oh, what do they have on Instagram?
[8787.85s -> 8789.61s]  Oh, what's their Instagram look like?
[8789.61s -> 8793.51s]  It's just like all pictures have given the finger.
[8793.51s -> 8796.76s]  Like, okay, do you have any others?
[8796.76s -> 8798.96s]  It's like, oh yeah, like finger, finger, finger,
[8798.96s -> 8801.75s]  like given the finger.
[8801.75s -> 8807.41s]  Guys on Tinder, yeah, just like, oh yeah, finger.
[8807.41s -> 8813.68s]  That's king shit.
[8813.68s -> 8815.68s]  But the thing is I kinda have one of those too.
[8815.68s -> 8818.75s]  I usually, I'll do thumbs up.
[8818.75s -> 8822.77s]  I'll put thumbs up or like peace.
[8822.77s -> 8824.97s]  I'll do like thumbs up or like fist.
[8824.97s -> 8826.56s]  I put my fist out.
[8826.56s -> 8827.40s]  I don't know why.
[8827.40s -> 8830.54s]  It's like, okay, I do the thing
[8830.54s -> 8833.34s]  that if you were to take a picture with a UFC fighter,
[8833.34s -> 8837.18s]  like, oh, hey, hey, I don't know any UFC fighters.
[8837.18s -> 8838.62s]  I can't come up with one.
[8838.62s -> 8839.66s]  I'm gonna make one up.
[8839.66s -> 8843.40s]  Hey, fighter, can I get a fit picture?
[8843.40s -> 8844.56s]  And they do that thing with their hands
[8844.56s -> 8845.84s]  and they put their like fist up,
[8845.84s -> 8847.97s]  like, yeah, I'm gonna knock somebody out.
[8847.97s -> 8852.61s]  I do that.
[8852.61s -> 8853.43s]  I don't know why.
[8853.43s -> 8858.58s]  I put like fist up, two fists, thumbs up, fist.
[8859.30s -> 8864.52s]  I have no idea why I do that.
[8864.52s -> 8867.08s]  Let's keep going.
[8867.08s -> 8869.54s]  Yeah, I'm a big fan of fighter.
[8869.54s -> 8872.07s]  I thought just going to leave with me here.
[8872.07s -> 8881.73s]  Oh, aren't even going to throw with me the picture.
[8881.73s -> 8886.00s]  Why would you wanna take a picture with you?
[8886.00s -> 8888.20s]  I don't know.
[8888.20s -> 8890.04s]  I don't like, you don't, I'm not looking for that.
[8890.04s -> 8907.00s]  If you want one, I'll do it.
[8907.00s -> 8911.40s]  Chris, are you wondering how Suzy is doing right now?
[8911.40s -> 8912.24s]  I mean, I'll be honest.
[8912.24s -> 8914.48s]  I actually forgot the person was in the game.
[8914.48s -> 8918.04s]  It's been like a while.
[8918.04s -> 8920.36s]  I know I don't, I don't, it's not that I don't care.
[8920.36s -> 8923.95s]  Yeah, I've been wondering.
[8923.95s -> 8926.31s]  Well, then why don't we close our eyes
[8926.31s -> 8927.63s]  and think about what she's doing now.
[8927.63s -> 8934.52s]  I don't want, I don't really want to do that.
[8934.52s -> 8938.02s]  What a strange moon.
[8938.02s -> 8944.10s]  Like nothing I've ever seen before.
[8944.10s -> 8949.79s]  This world, I wish Death could see it.
[8949.79s -> 8950.99s]  That was bad acting, I'm sorry.
[8950.99s -> 8953.52s]  I'll go, I'll be better.
[8953.52s -> 8956.44s]  Is somebody there?
[8956.44s -> 8958.16s]  Wait, what are you?
[8958.16s -> 8967.26s]  Hey, you can't capture someone who's already captured.
[8967.26s -> 8974.07s]  Suzy, you saved me.
[8974.07s -> 8976.09s]  Don't get used to it.
[8976.09s -> 8984.48s]  Okay, I won't.
[8984.48s -> 8987.24s]  Cool moon.
[8989.08s -> 8991.13s]  Yeah, it's weird, isn't it?
[8991.13s -> 8993.10s]  How did we get here?
[8993.10s -> 8996.76s]  Now, what even is this place?
[8996.76s -> 8999.12s]  You see, a million years ago,
[8999.12s -> 9002.05s]  a bomb exploded in the atmosphere.
[9002.05s -> 9005.60s]  You know what, it's too much for right now.
[9005.60s -> 9014.90s]  It's Evil Queen's Castle or the Dark World.
[9014.90s -> 9024.99s]  I mean, aren't both of these things true?
[9024.99s -> 9032.00s]  You're just having a dream.
[9032.00s -> 9034.28s]  Oh, oh, that's right, right.
[9034.28s -> 9039.64s]  If you're here, it must be a dream.
[9039.64s -> 9044.16s]  I mean, the real Suzy probably wouldn't save me, would she?
[9044.16s -> 9050.95s]  Probably doesn't care about me at all.
[9050.95s -> 9056.38s]  Why would you think that?
[9056.38s -> 9060.36s]  She doesn't care about anybody.
[9060.36s -> 9063.96s]  Well, fair, but did you ever wonder
[9063.96s -> 9068.24s]  why Suzy never picked on you?
[9068.24s -> 9071.33s]  All the time.
[9071.33s -> 9073.77s]  This is kind of an inaccurate, if you were lucid.
[9073.77s -> 9076.61s]  If I'm lucid, it's only happened a few times,
[9076.61s -> 9078.21s]  but I just started, I'm lucid,
[9078.21s -> 9079.53s]  I'm grabbing like the fucking Biro
[9079.53s -> 9080.37s]  and I'm throwing it out the window.
[9080.37s -> 9082.61s]  I'm throwing it out the window, it's hard as I can.
[9082.61s -> 9087.84s]  Like, I'm just gonna start smashing the window.
[9087.84s -> 9088.68s]  This is my one opportunity
[9088.68s -> 9090.00s]  to like throw a Biro out of the window.
[9090.00s -> 9092.94s]  I'm gonna do it.
[9092.94s -> 9095.06s]  The second that I feel lucid, it's just like,
[9095.06s -> 9096.30s]  oh my fucking God, I'm gonna dream.
[9096.30s -> 9098.49s]  Okay, okay, I see a stick over there.
[9098.49s -> 9099.81s]  I'm just throwing, I'm gonna javelin the stick
[9099.81s -> 9101.85s]  out the window, because like, I'm gonna do that.
[9101.85s -> 9102.77s]  That's what I'm doing in my lucid dream.
[9102.77s -> 9106.84s]  I'm awake.
[9106.84s -> 9107.68s]  You're ruining the moment.
[9107.68s -> 9114.31s]  All right, all right, all right, all right, all right.
[9114.31s -> 9117.68s]  Maybe it's because when she first came to class,
[9117.68s -> 9119.00s]  you lent her one of your pencils.
[9119.00s -> 9125.14s]  Somebody call me a caveman.
[9125.14s -> 9126.94s]  Okay, we're actually ruining this.
[9128.47s -> 9130.47s]  Stick, I see stick.
[9130.47s -> 9131.95s]  Break something.
[9131.95s -> 9135.46s]  Smash.
[9135.46s -> 9138.46s]  All right, I'm gonna actually pay attention.
[9138.46s -> 9140.95s]  I know.
[9140.95s -> 9143.56s]  You lent her one of your pencils.
[9143.56s -> 9149.50s]  Like a dumb candy cane looking one or something.
[9149.54s -> 9152.49s]  Even though it didn't actually taste like candy.
[9152.49s -> 9159.42s]  She remembered your smile and decided to spare you, you know?
[9159.42s -> 9163.29s]  That's really specific.
[9163.29s -> 9168.23s]  Yeah, well, wait, did you say you ate the pencil?
[9168.23s -> 9176.09s]  I mean, look, hey, so do you dream about me a lot?
[9176.09s -> 9178.77s]  Well, time for me to get back to my project.
[9180.13s -> 9182.57s]  Okay, Susie, hit me with your ax and wake me up.
[9185.10s -> 9186.74s]  No, I can't do that.
[9186.74s -> 9187.58s]  Why not?
[9187.58s -> 9190.12s]  Is this a dream?
[9190.12s -> 9197.95s]  I mean, didn't you wanna hang out some more?
[9197.95s -> 9200.66s]  Stop voice acting?
[9200.66s -> 9203.82s]  You want us to hit A and we'll just read it silently together?
[9203.82s -> 9206.66s]  I'm reading it.
[9206.66s -> 9212.06s]  I'm that guy for four years.
[9212.06s -> 9216.86s]  I guess Birdly can wait a little longer.
[9216.86s -> 9223.27s]  All right, let's get out of here then.
[9223.27s -> 9226.05s]  Now, the person out four years and Goldfish years.
[9226.05s -> 9229.08s]  Should be like, I don't know, probably like a few hours.
[9229.08s -> 9236.86s]  All we gotta do is head to the right over this.
[9236.86s -> 9244.42s]  Over here on this, wait, this is a dream.
[9244.42s -> 9252.22s]  Heart covered Ferris wheel.
[9252.30s -> 9255.15s]  God damn, hold up, get on already.
[9255.15s -> 9264.10s]  Sorry, what the hell am I supposed to do here?
[9265.46s -> 9268.43s]  Chris would know what to do.
[9268.43s -> 9272.10s]  Eat moss.
[9272.10s -> 9274.76s]  Me caveman, caveman in lucid dream.
[9274.76s -> 9278.70s]  Eat moss, break things, smash.
[9278.70s -> 9285.44s]  Point and hearts come out.
[9285.44s -> 9286.40s]  Did I eat the moss?
[9286.40s -> 9287.44s]  I feel like that's weird.
[9287.44s -> 9292.06s]  Why would somebody do that?
[9292.06s -> 9293.06s]  I'm gonna eat moss.
[9294.85s -> 9297.29s]  Actually, maybe Chris wouldn't know what to do.
[9299.27s -> 9300.83s]  So, Ferris wheels, huh?
[9302.15s -> 9306.17s]  Kinda makes you wonder what car they were built for.
[9306.21s -> 9308.33s]  It's different than riding one with Chris.
[9309.53s -> 9310.29s]  What the hell's wrong?
[9310.29s -> 9311.37s]  You scared of heights?
[9312.37s -> 9314.33s]  No, no, I love heights, ha ha.
[9317.32s -> 9318.68s]  You're shaking.
[9319.76s -> 9324.24s]  Well, maybe I'm a little scared, but I, to be honest,
[9324.24s -> 9325.68s]  I actually like scary things.
[9327.00s -> 9327.84s]  What do you mean?
[9329.06s -> 9331.38s]  When we were little, me and my sister would stay up
[9331.38s -> 9333.74s]  and go past our bedtime watching horror movies.
[9334.66s -> 9337.54s]  At first I cried, but now it's like watching them
[9337.54s -> 9338.86s]  makes me feel comforted.
[9340.68s -> 9341.96s]  Comforted?
[9341.96s -> 9343.96s]  I guess I do like slime and blood.
[9346.17s -> 9348.71s]  Scary, but I can just turn it off, right?
[9348.71s -> 9351.11s]  No, it's mostly people that are scary, ha ha.
[9356.90s -> 9359.26s]  Just say you mean, you can just say you mean me.
[9362.02s -> 9366.74s]  Well, I guess you too, but that's what's nice about you,
[9366.74s -> 9368.55s]  you know?
[9368.55s -> 9371.06s]  Nice, the hell does that mean?
[9371.06s -> 9373.30s]  You're the good kind of scary.
[9373.30s -> 9375.54s]  You aren't afraid to break the rules, you know?
[9376.66s -> 9386.28s]  Wish I could do crazy stuff like you.
[9386.28s -> 9393.66s]  Okay, this is the difference here.
[9393.66s -> 9398.32s]  Nuts would be like, nuts would be like I get up
[9398.32s -> 9403.09s]  and just start like flossing, right?
[9403.09s -> 9404.93s]  Like, that's nuts.
[9404.93s -> 9412.04s]  Crazy would be, I see how long I can like hold my breath for.
[9412.04s -> 9414.74s]  Which one?
[9414.74s -> 9418.54s]  Or like, I see if I can like hang outside the Ferris wheel
[9418.54s -> 9420.50s]  with my hands, but like a photo.
[9420.50s -> 9421.78s]  Like take a picture of me hanging outside
[9421.78s -> 9423.22s]  the Ferris wheel with my hands.
[9429.14s -> 9432.36s]  Uh, this is crazy, a smash window.
[9432.36s -> 9434.16s]  All right, let's do nuts.
[9434.16s -> 9438.60s]  So, um, you could do something crazy right now.
[9438.60s -> 9439.52s]  What would you do?
[9443.01s -> 9448.17s]  Well, I jump out the window, see?
[9448.17s -> 9449.97s]  She gets it.
[9449.97s -> 9450.81s]  Huh?
[9451.65s -> 9453.05s]  It's a dream, right?
[9453.05s -> 9454.33s]  And I'm the fucking weirdo.
[9454.33s -> 9456.29s]  This is all you guys, all you guys' favorite character
[9456.29s -> 9459.13s]  just said the same goddamn thing that I did.
[9459.13s -> 9462.69s]  I'd grow big angel wings and fly as far as I can,
[9462.69s -> 9466.26s]  gazing back at it all.
[9466.26s -> 9468.38s]  Skyline shining like holiday lights.
[9470.39s -> 9471.71s]  Window.
[9471.71s -> 9472.71s]  That's kind of beautiful.
[9472.71s -> 9475.23s]  Wait, you wouldn't seriously jump out, would you?
[9477.58s -> 9478.42s]  No promises.
[9480.42s -> 9481.90s]  So, see?
[9481.90s -> 9483.74s]  What do you think looking out there?
[9484.66s -> 9485.50s]  Me?
[9485.50s -> 9494.36s]  Um, I mean, do we kind of, do we say something romantic here?
[9494.36s -> 9496.70s]  Do we say something cool?
[9496.70s -> 9499.86s]  I think we've already done the cool bit, right?
[9499.86s -> 9509.23s]  We already are cool.
[9509.23s -> 9510.07s]  Stay cool?
[9510.07s -> 9511.35s]  I feel like we've already been cool.
[9511.35s -> 9513.19s]  I feel like we've stayed cool for the first,
[9513.19s -> 9514.91s]  like, half of this Ferris wheel ride.
[9514.91s -> 9521.16s]  I think it's time to do something romantic.
[9521.16s -> 9522.00s]  Let's go for it.
[9523.72s -> 9527.13s]  Seeing everything small makes me feel like, um,
[9527.13s -> 9529.05s]  if I was Susie Zilla or something,
[9529.05s -> 9531.82s]  I could wreck the whole city.
[9531.82s -> 9533.22s]  Ha ha ha, Susie!
[9534.06s -> 9535.62s]  Eh, well, that's romantic.
[9536.58s -> 9539.22s]  Is being Susie Zilla something you think about a lot?
[9540.54s -> 9546.35s]  Like, no, I just made it up now.
[9546.35s -> 9548.43s]  Does your tail always do that when you lie?
[9549.55s -> 9551.27s]  Hey, hey, don't look at that!
[9551.27s -> 9555.86s]  I don't have a tail, it's part of your dream.
[9555.86s -> 9556.98s]  Oh, right, sorry.
[9560.67s -> 9563.11s]  Guess I'll just have to check in real life, too.
[9564.47s -> 9565.31s]  Hey, don't.
[9568.03s -> 9569.51s]  Susie, is everything okay?
[9570.39s -> 9573.79s]  Look, I just, I just don't like people knowing about it.
[9575.80s -> 9579.41s]  Well, I think it's a nice tail.
[9579.41s -> 9584.22s]  Whatever, it's wagging.
[9584.22s -> 9586.44s]  All right, do you guys even have dogs?
[9586.44s -> 9589.64s]  Anytime you have a dog, if your dog's lying down,
[9589.64s -> 9593.10s]  just kinda hanging out, does your dog do this, too?
[9593.10s -> 9596.72s]  Where, if you look at your dog, right, like in the eyes,
[9596.72s -> 9598.84s]  or if you look over at them and they're just kinda relaxing,
[9598.84s -> 9605.94s]  you'll just, you'll just hear that, that's what Otto does.
[9605.94s -> 9607.66s]  Like, you look over, you're just sitting there,
[9607.66s -> 9609.90s]  you might be playing a game, you're watching TV.
[9609.90s -> 9611.10s]  Dog is on your right, they're just,
[9611.10s -> 9612.70s]  they're not paying attention to you at all.
[9612.70s -> 9614.66s]  They just sense your eyeballs.
[9614.66s -> 9622.18s]  You turn and look, it's the cutest thing ever.
[9622.18s -> 9623.26s]  Susie's not a dog.
[9624.22s -> 9633.23s]  I didn't, I didn't say that Susie was a dog.
[9633.23s -> 9636.53s]  You stopped shaking.
[9636.53s -> 9640.17s]  Yes, I got comfortable.
[9640.17s -> 9642.78s]  Me, too.
[9643.94s -> 9646.29s]  Well, that wasn't too bad.
[9646.29s -> 9654.09s]  Yeah, if only I could dream like this every day.
[9654.09s -> 9655.01s]  All right, at what point do I just go,
[9655.01s -> 9656.73s]  all right, hey, this is not a dream.
[9656.73s -> 9658.97s]  This is real, this is a real thing.
[9658.97s -> 9660.89s]  I just was messing with you.
[9660.89s -> 9664.97s]  Maybe it doesn't have to be a dream, you know?
[9664.97s -> 9668.09s]  Susie, maybe, maybe someday we could.
[9676.99s -> 9680.27s]  Noel, my lady, the cavalry has arrived to rescue you.
[9681.53s -> 9684.87s]  Oh, the good part of the dream is over.
[9684.87s -> 9687.87s]  It's fine, we're at least gonna help, we're allies.
[9687.87s -> 9690.75s]  Yes, don't worry, Noel, I'm stupid now.
[9693.37s -> 9696.68s]  He's good.
[9696.68s -> 9699.44s]  Look, I gotta go save the day now, all right?
[9699.44s -> 9701.04s]  Uh-huh, good luck, Susie.
[9701.96s -> 9706.02s]  All right, nugget boy, it's up to you now.
[9706.02s -> 9709.86s]  Leave everything to me, my dear Susan.
[9712.54s -> 9718.22s]  Yeah, whatever, may the smarts be with you.
[9718.22s -> 9721.86s]  Ah, she left before I could.
[9721.86s -> 9724.70s]  Noel, it's hard to say this.
[9724.70s -> 9728.74s]  You've done so much for me, and I, well, I'm sorry.
[9730.06s -> 9733.30s]  Ridley, you're actually apologizing?
[9733.30s -> 9735.58s]  Thank you, I understand, you know.
[9735.58s -> 9739.42s]  You've always been nice to me when it's just the two of us.
[9739.42s -> 9742.10s]  Just wanted to make a happy world for me.
[9742.10s -> 9744.70s]  I'm glad you realized it sucked.
[9746.30s -> 9748.00s]  Oh.
[9748.00s -> 9749.26s]  Huh?
[9749.30s -> 9753.30s]  I mean, yes, I was, in a way, apologizing for that.
[9753.30s -> 9761.99s]  But I also wanted to apologize for leading you on.
[9761.99s -> 9764.79s]  I know you only always helped me out because, well,
[9766.17s -> 9767.81s]  you had a crush on me, so.
[9768.89s -> 9770.42s]  What?
[9770.42s -> 9773.33s]  Oh, sorry, please don't be embarrassed.
[9773.33s -> 9775.89s]  It's understandable, but I have to tell you,
[9775.89s -> 9779.01s]  I really value your friendship, okay?
[9779.01s -> 9784.98s]  So I felt I had to pretend to reciprocate those feelings.
[9785.02s -> 9785.86s]  What?
[9785.86s -> 9791.88s]  I don't, I never, no, the more I think that I may have
[9791.88s -> 9794.58s]  discovered someone else for me.
[9794.58s -> 9796.09s]  Huh?
[9796.09s -> 9798.80s]  Please don't be jealous.
[9798.80s -> 9800.49s]  Of?
[9800.49s -> 9801.33s]  Susie.
[9802.37s -> 9803.21s]  What?
[9803.21s -> 9804.37s]  What, what, what?
[9804.37s -> 9807.33s]  Bart, what are you doing, Bart?
[9812.64s -> 9816.91s]  That was a bad homer, but I only had a second.
[9816.91s -> 9820.18s]  So that's why.
[9820.18s -> 9825.10s]  Geronimo.
[9825.10s -> 9826.78s]  Hey, miss me?
[9826.78s -> 9828.30s]  Of course not.
[9829.14s -> 9829.98s]  Yes, kidding, that was sarcasm.
[9829.98s -> 9831.40s]  I miss you.
[9831.40s -> 9836.44s]  Hey, we gotta work on your delivery.
[9836.44s -> 9840.60s]  Anyway, let's go.
[9840.60s -> 9842.60s]  Everyone's together, but the wind blows coldly.
[9842.60s -> 9844.60s]  You are filled with a certain power.
[9855.84s -> 9856.68s]  Why, you little.
[9863.95s -> 9866.75s]  Wear, wear wire strongly blocks the way.
[9868.87s -> 9872.41s]  Be tough, be sweet, let's be sweet.
[9872.41s -> 9874.05s]  And let's do that.
[9874.05s -> 9876.93s]  You and Rousey whispered sweetly to wear, wear wire,
[9876.97s -> 9879.85s]  pretending not to care, but acts became more effective.
[9880.73s -> 9881.57s]  Susie laughed.
[9890.14s -> 9892.26s]  It was like a lightning strike.
[9892.26s -> 9897.38s]  Okay, now let's be tough.
[9897.38s -> 9899.90s]  You and Susie told wear, wear wire you'd beat them up.
[9899.90s -> 9902.34s]  The air crackles with fighting spirit.
[9902.34s -> 9904.34s]  Rousey winks demurely.
[9913.41s -> 9914.25s]  How you doing?
[9914.25s -> 9915.09s]  Good?
[9915.09s -> 9918.34s]  No, not yet.
[9918.34s -> 9920.78s]  Let's be cold.
[9920.78s -> 9924.07s]  That's standard.
[9924.07s -> 9931.13s]  Let's spare.
[9931.13s -> 9932.90s]  You won.
[9932.90s -> 9934.98s]  All right, let's do the third floor.
[9934.98s -> 9938.11s]  Check here.
[9938.99s -> 9940.95s]  Whoa, this statue rocks.
[9940.95s -> 9944.03s]  Hey, Rousey, can we take this from my room?
[9945.87s -> 9947.98s]  That would be stealing.
[9947.98s -> 9951.74s]  You stole the Susie-like statue.
[9951.74s -> 9953.70s]  There are all sorts of clothes inside.
[9953.70s -> 9958.01s]  Oh, I've never seen Noel wear anything like this.
[9958.01s -> 9963.33s]  The search is isoreal cryptid.
[9963.33s -> 9965.69s]  It's a cross between ICE and something else.
[9966.82s -> 9969.14s]  Hey, Chris, take this for your room.
[9969.14s -> 9970.34s]  That would be stealing.
[9970.34s -> 9974.42s]  You stole the ICE statue.
[9974.42s -> 9975.50s]  Catalogs of search results.
[9975.54s -> 9981.57s]  Seems like most things couldn't be made into objects.
[9981.57s -> 9984.07s]  It's a bed, go to sleep?
[9984.07s -> 9985.47s]  Yes.
[9985.47s -> 9987.75s]  Chris, what if Noel came in here?
[9987.75s -> 9989.15s]  Yeah, what if she has tics?
[9989.15s -> 9993.19s]  Get out of there.
[9993.19s -> 10002.46s]  Wardrobe, it's a calendar.
[10002.46s -> 10003.86s]  Every page is the last month.
[10003.86s -> 10013.46s]  Every day is the 25th.
[10013.46s -> 10014.30s]  What's this?
[10036.14s -> 10046.69s]  I'm gonna go up top.
[10046.69s -> 10048.21s]  Go to the trash zone, trash zone.
[10048.21s -> 10050.33s]  Trash, trash, trash, trash, trash, trash, trash.
[10050.33s -> 10053.01s]  Am I at the end of the game?
[10053.01s -> 10053.85s]  This is it?
[10053.85s -> 10057.35s]  I'm not gonna have an opportunity to go to the trash zone?
[10057.35s -> 10059.21s]  This is it?
[10059.21s -> 10060.05s]  You're at the end.
[10060.93s -> 10062.62s]  Am I gonna go to the trash zone?
[10062.62s -> 10067.94s]  You're literally one step away from the end.
[10067.94s -> 10069.74s]  I already did the Spampin' thing.
[10069.74s -> 10071.56s]  Is there something else there?
[10071.56s -> 10074.41s]  Did I already do that?
[10074.41s -> 10075.53s]  You don't have to?
[10075.53s -> 10077.25s]  You got a few hours left.
[10077.25s -> 10081.16s]  No, I don't think that's correct.
[10081.16s -> 10084.38s]  No, it's, can I do it afterwards?
[10084.38s -> 10087.06s]  There's something there.
[10087.06s -> 10088.50s]  Lore, lore.
[10088.50s -> 10094.70s]  I'll go after her.
[10094.70s -> 10103.20s]  There she is.
[10103.20s -> 10106.02s]  Queen, stop right there.
[10106.02s -> 10108.58s]  Oh, my sweet idiot children.
[10108.58s -> 10111.98s]  You are just in time to witness my world domination.
[10111.98s -> 10113.42s]  With Noelle in my possession,
[10113.42s -> 10116.38s]  it is only a matter of time before her will turns
[10116.38s -> 10118.66s]  and she unleashes her power.
[10118.66s -> 10120.74s]  Blaketing the world in.
[10120.74s -> 10122.78s]  Too late, dumbass.
[10122.78s -> 10125.14s]  Noelle's with Birdly.
[10125.14s -> 10128.18s]  Oh, and who is this?
[10130.59s -> 10132.63s]  Birdly.
[10132.63s -> 10134.47s]  He's been intercepted.
[10134.47s -> 10137.85s]  My control plugs are now suitable for teenagers.
[10137.85s -> 10141.99s]  Now the whole family can enjoy eternal servitude.
[10142.03s -> 10145.39s]  What sort of regal, mostly cruel laughter?
[10145.39s -> 10147.42s]  Hee hee hee.
[10147.42s -> 10148.26s]  Wait there.
[10148.26s -> 10150.19s]  Where's Noelle?
[10150.19s -> 10151.03s]  Ho ho ho ho ho ho.
[10151.03s -> 10153.20s]  Ha ha ha ha.
[10153.20s -> 10155.28s]  I wonder.
[10155.28s -> 10157.48s]  I actually know the answer.
[10157.48s -> 10159.28s]  Enough already.
[10159.28s -> 10160.68s]  Oh dear.
[10160.68s -> 10162.96s]  I do sincerely quite like you two.
[10164.08s -> 10167.12s]  It would be a shame for me to force you to serve me.
[10167.12s -> 10172.10s]  An enjoyable shame.
[10172.10s -> 10173.74s]  This is the end.
[10173.74s -> 10175.02s]  The queen blocks the way.
[10176.04s -> 10177.32s]  Queen defenseless.
[10178.76s -> 10179.60s]  Throw.
[10179.60s -> 10180.88s]  Group loosen.
[10180.88s -> 10184.08s]  All right, we're gonna group loosen on Birdly.
[10184.08s -> 10186.68s]  Birdly's gonna get sentient again.
[10186.68s -> 10187.60s]  Join the party.
[10188.64s -> 10191.97s]  This is a good song.
[10191.97s -> 10193.98s]  Everyone loosens Birdly.
[10193.98s -> 10195.74s]  Queen, think of the lighteners.
[10195.74s -> 10198.02s]  Aren't we supposed to make them happy?
[10198.02s -> 10201.90s]  That's not what I'm doing?
[10201.90s -> 10208.88s]  Ooh, I didn't know they were gonna move like that.
[10208.88s -> 10209.72s]  Shit.
[10209.72s -> 10212.94s]  Fountain flows ominously.
[10212.94s -> 10214.22s]  Oh shit, I thought that was,
[10214.30s -> 10216.89s]  I thought that was her mouth.
[10216.89s -> 10218.21s]  I thought that was the big statue
[10218.21s -> 10219.45s]  and it actually was her
[10219.45s -> 10222.25s]  and that was her mouth opening and closing.
[10222.25s -> 10223.65s]  I thought she was like the biggest
[10223.65s -> 10227.63s]  to-stay-fuck marshmallow in there.
[10227.63s -> 10234.83s]  All right, throw, group loosen again.
[10234.83s -> 10237.49s]  No, I'm gonna throw.
[10237.49s -> 10239.27s]  Does that need to heal?
[10239.27s -> 10240.71s]  Oh, fuck.
[10240.71s -> 10248.51s]  We'll do it next time.
[10248.51s -> 10249.92s]  Bingo!
[10249.92s -> 10252.00s]  I can't, my voice is fucked.
[10252.00s -> 10253.80s]  I got too old, I can't do it anymore.
[10253.80s -> 10255.64s]  If I talk loudly,
[10255.64s -> 10261.82s]  if I yell loudly without screaming, that happens.
[10261.86s -> 10271.31s]  I'm too old.
[10271.31s -> 10278.46s]  Queen's acid shield is formed.
[10278.46s -> 10281.47s]  All right, we're gonna do group toast.
[10281.47s -> 10283.03s]  All right, group toast.
[10283.03s -> 10285.87s]  That glass of acid is generating her shield.
[10285.87s -> 10289.75s]  No, are you gonna drink all that?
[10289.75s -> 10292.42s]  No, this is all mine, you can't have it.
[10292.42s -> 10295.76s]  Queen sips from her acid.
[10295.76s -> 10298.64s]  Each day they spend hours worshiping and glowing rapture.
[10298.64s -> 10308.78s]  Our screens are funny animals in Candied Game.
[10308.78s -> 10310.26s]  Fucking 10 years of Binding of Isaac
[10310.26s -> 10314.32s]  prepared me for that one.
[10314.32s -> 10315.89s]  Group toast.
[10315.89s -> 10317.80s]  Toast to the queen.
[10317.80s -> 10320.06s]  Queen sips from her acid.
[10320.06s -> 10324.69s]  Oh, staring, tapping to receive joy.
[10324.69s -> 10337.10s]  Staring, tapping to avoid pain.
[10337.10s -> 10338.38s]  Easy.
[10338.38s -> 10339.70s]  All right, acid shield is down.
[10339.70s -> 10342.46s]  We're gonna do group loosen again.
[10342.46s -> 10344.47s]  What's he at?
[10344.47s -> 10347.11s]  Recently when the town's internet disappeared.
[10347.11s -> 10352.90s]  Now the refuge they take in the screens will slowly fade.
[10352.90s -> 10360.60s]  I'll drink.
[10360.60s -> 10361.60s]  Acid shield is there again.
[10361.60s -> 10363.16s]  All right, I'll spare.
[10363.16s -> 10365.97s]  He's almost halfway.
[10365.97s -> 10370.39s]  I am going to dual heal.
[10370.39s -> 10372.98s]  Yeah, let's do dual heal.
[10372.98s -> 10378.47s]  And then we're just gonna toast to the queen.
[10378.47s -> 10381.15s]  The soul shined its power on Rousey.
[10381.15s -> 10383.27s]  Susie made a toast to the queen.
[10383.27s -> 10386.75s]  Pretty cool how we're gonna kick your ass.
[10386.75s -> 10389.26s]  It's a good thing I have no standards for this.
[10389.26s -> 10393.64s]  Queen sips from her acid.
[10393.64s -> 10397.37s]  Rousey casts dual heal, there we go.
[10397.37s -> 10399.49s]  Well, then who will help her?
[10399.49s -> 10402.57s]  For strange and sad searches, who will answer them?
[10406.74s -> 10411.28s]  Ooh, that's a weird one.
[10411.28s -> 10416.07s]  That's an interesting one.
[10416.07s -> 10419.79s]  Toast.
[10419.79s -> 10422.23s]  Is what I wondered until the night appeared
[10422.23s -> 10434.20s]  and created this wonderful world of darkness.
[10434.20s -> 10436.84s]  Smells like overclocked high heels.
[10442.58s -> 10449.66s]  Toast, come on.
[10449.66s -> 10464.14s]  Expand the dark world.
[10464.14s -> 10468.07s]  One more toast.
[10468.07s -> 10470.58s]  Here it goes, all right.
[10470.58s -> 10472.70s]  End the world covered in darkness.
[10472.70s -> 10483.60s]  No one will have to suffer anymore.
[10483.60s -> 10486.13s]  All right, let's go for it.
[10486.13s -> 10488.01s]  Group loosen again.
[10488.01s -> 10490.00s]  He's close.
[10490.04s -> 10492.52s]  Everyone can live in my perfect mansion.
[10492.52s -> 10500.11s]  Every day blissfully worshiping me like we both deserve.
[10500.11s -> 10506.70s]  Drama.
[10506.70s -> 10508.66s]  All right, what are they at?
[10508.66s -> 10515.29s]  Birdly is almost there.
[10515.29s -> 10518.26s]  Red Buster.
[10518.26s -> 10520.98s]  No, throw.
[10520.98s -> 10527.15s]  Yeah, then we can do a group heal.
[10527.15s -> 10537.22s]  No, heal Chris.
[10537.22s -> 10554.11s]  Stop resisting and welcome the new age of darkness.
[10554.11s -> 10556.42s]  Red Buster.
[10556.42s -> 10557.50s]  Is this gonna hurt?
[10561.45s -> 10563.05s]  I'm not gonna hurt her.
[10563.05s -> 10569.68s]  Let's try it.
[10569.68s -> 10570.60s]  See what happens.
[10570.60s -> 10572.52s]  Bowser made a toast to the queen.
[10572.52s -> 10575.86s]  Toast to you, making me wear a butler outfit.
[10575.86s -> 10579.97s]  Bro, that's weird, but okay.
[10579.97s -> 10580.97s]  All right, Red Buster.
[10580.97s -> 10586.58s]  Ooh, all right, that took a lot down.
[10586.58s -> 10596.42s]  What did I say, I would do that?
[10596.42s -> 10597.94s]  Oh, that's a weird pattern.
[10597.94s -> 10604.81s]  Okay, we're gonna go with...
[10604.81s -> 10606.69s]  I'm going to...
[10606.69s -> 10608.45s]  I need to do a group heal.
[10608.45s -> 10615.31s]  I need the TP.
[10615.31s -> 10618.70s]  Which is it?
[10618.70s -> 10619.54s]  Do I not have it?
[10619.54s -> 10620.38s]  Heal player?
[10620.38s -> 10622.02s]  I don't have a group heal?
[10622.02s -> 10626.38s]  Fuck.
[10626.38s -> 10629.79s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[10629.79s -> 10632.01s]  Shit, no, I don't have any more.
[10632.01s -> 10640.21s]  Revive's team.
[10640.21s -> 10641.85s]  Oh shit, I need 50 TP.
[10641.85s -> 10645.70s]  Dammit, all right, we're gonna defend.
[10645.70s -> 10650.66s]  All right, he has to play.
[10650.66s -> 10651.62s]  No, what am I doing?
[10651.62s -> 10653.18s]  Oops, okay.
[10653.18s -> 10654.02s]  No, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[10654.02s -> 10667.27s]  All right, I didn't want to spend all that.
[10667.27s -> 10668.67s]  Just don't get hit, bro.
[10668.67s -> 10674.72s]  Just don't get hit, bro.
[10674.72s -> 10676.92s]  All right, now we're gonna get the bird.
[10676.92s -> 10677.76s]  Let's go.
[10677.76s -> 10679.04s]  Enough, you foolish children.
[10679.04s -> 10681.24s]  You may have survived my attacks regularly,
[10681.24s -> 10682.80s]  but I've been secretly, been secretly,
[10682.80s -> 10685.80s]  been downloading my ultimate move the whole time.
[10685.84s -> 10699.05s]  Perish in the bosom of my hellish reign.
[10699.05s -> 10701.49s]  Ooh, that was close.
[10701.49s -> 10707.53s]  All right, let's get him.
[10707.53s -> 10708.69s]  This should be enough, right?
[10708.69s -> 10710.86s]  Group loosen.
[10710.86s -> 10715.16s]  Oh, so that final move was supposed to be cooler,
[10715.16s -> 10726.26s]  but the internet is down.
[10726.26s -> 10727.26s]  Sounds like overclocked high heals.
[10727.26s -> 10731.88s]  All right, we need, what do I have?
[10731.88s -> 10734.65s]  Revive dust?
[10734.65s -> 10736.01s]  Revive's team.
[10736.01s -> 10744.87s]  Oh shit, will this work?
[10744.87s -> 10751.74s]  Can I revive him, like heal him?
[10751.74s -> 10753.06s]  What is he at right now?
[10753.06s -> 10768.67s]  All right, he's like there.
[10768.71s -> 10771.40s]  Okay, early wire is loose.
[10771.40s -> 10773.38s]  What, juice?
[10773.38s -> 10775.46s]  I think we got it.
[10776.46s -> 10778.02s]  Not bad, you foolish children.
[10780.80s -> 10785.02s]  Hmm?
[10785.02s -> 10786.26s]  What are you doing?
[10786.26s -> 10788.62s]  Why isn't my control wire working?
[10788.62s -> 10790.98s]  Thanks to my comrades' kindness, their mercy.
[10792.42s -> 10795.34s]  Now, it's time for me to take my freedom.
[10797.32s -> 10801.20s]  Queen, you may have mastered the number three,
[10801.20s -> 10805.61s]  but can you stand up against four of us?
[10805.61s -> 10808.64s]  Warning simulation for the number four.
[10808.64s -> 10812.64s]  Hmm, you are definitely going to kick my ass.
[10812.64s -> 10819.93s]  Unless, oh no, what that?
[10819.93s -> 10829.24s]  Wait, one nanosecond, you cowardette.
[10829.24s -> 10830.80s]  Glass.
[10830.80s -> 10831.64s]  Birdly?
[10833.12s -> 10836.28s]  Ah, just now was nothing more than simple bravado.
[10836.28s -> 10838.92s]  Truth is, that wire already absorbed
[10838.92s -> 10841.16s]  all of my succulent energy juices.
[10844.63s -> 10847.36s]  Birdly, hey, Birdly, are you okay?
[10847.36s -> 10853.10s]  Everything getting dark, only a kiss
[10853.46s -> 10856.50s]  from a beautiful gamer girl can save me now.
[10859.13s -> 10859.97s]  Birdly.
[10863.08s -> 10864.44s]  What?
[10864.44s -> 10867.00s]  Like, you're like losing consciousness and stuff,
[10867.00s -> 10869.61s]  but like, could you speak up?
[10869.61s -> 10873.58s]  Ah, sorry, suddenly I'm feeling a bit better.
[10875.02s -> 10876.47s]  Hey, that's a relief.
[10879.41s -> 10884.52s]  Well, gotta hurry and save Noel, so later.
[10884.52s -> 10888.85s]  Hey, Susan, so enigmatic in her ways.
[10888.85s -> 10892.63s]  But I can read her heart, Chris, like a health meter.
[10892.63s -> 10894.07s]  It's beeping for love.
[10895.79s -> 10898.58s]  Well enough tales, Chris, good luck.
[10898.58s -> 10905.54s]  May the smarts not be with you.
[10905.54s -> 10914.66s]  Okay, Chris, your deep concern for me is dexterous.
[10914.66s -> 10918.91s]  Stay sanguine, my fellow blue bird.
[10918.91s -> 10929.21s]  I'll find some way to help you out.
[10929.21s -> 10930.37s]  If you're going to the trash zone,
[10930.37s -> 10937.62s]  this is the point of no return.
[10938.26s -> 10943.11s]  If I go right one screen, you're saying?
[10943.11s -> 10944.27s]  Should I go all the way back left
[10944.27s -> 10949.14s]  or do I have like a shortcut here?
[10949.14s -> 10952.43s]  Fuck the lore, don't.
[10952.43s -> 10956.78s]  Trash zone is just don't go, don't, who cares?
[10956.78s -> 10962.58s]  It's not important, okay.
[10962.58s -> 10973.90s]  Oh, whatever.
[10975.34s -> 10980.34s]  Night, roaring night, day it deigned
[10982.23s -> 10986.58s]  to create this world, reaching its long hand to the sky.
[10987.88s -> 10990.57s]  It caused its will into its blade,
[10991.71s -> 10995.03s]  made rusting the fountain from the earth.
[10998.69s -> 11001.13s]  Unfortunately, the world they created
[11001.13s -> 11003.69s]  is trapped within the confines of the library.
[11004.98s -> 11007.82s]  If only we had a way to make more darkness,
[11010.05s -> 11012.21s]  we might be able to cover the whole world.
[11017.02s -> 11020.44s]  That is when I realized this power,
[11020.44s -> 11024.16s]  this power of the will, this power of determination.
[11026.38s -> 11029.02s]  Is this not something that all lighteners possess?
[11030.46s -> 11033.02s]  If one was simply determined enough,
[11034.29s -> 11037.01s]  would not anyone make a dark fountain?
[11038.46s -> 11042.90s]  So then, if the night has taken its leave,
[11042.90s -> 11050.58s]  then I will simply make a new one.
[11050.58s -> 11052.38s]  Well, honey, darling, sweetie gravy,
[11053.22s -> 11056.36s]  how do you find the giant hand?
[11056.36s -> 11060.16s]  Great, but how do you feel about world domination?
[11060.84s -> 11066.55s]  Ooh, ouchie, mama.
[11066.55s -> 11069.22s]  Susie, you came to save me.
[11069.22s -> 11070.78s]  Somehow, I knew you would.
[11071.94s -> 11072.78s]  You did?
[11073.62s -> 11079.12s]  I mean, I, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11079.12s -> 11081.68s]  You need to get out of here, hurry.
[11081.68s -> 11088.22s]  Oh, she is giant.
[11088.22s -> 11089.14s]  Yeah, I knew it.
[11091.97s -> 11094.61s]  That was the statue I was thinking of, right?
[11094.61s -> 11096.33s]  I thought that portal was the mouth.
[11096.33s -> 11098.18s]  That's the real mouth.
[11098.18s -> 11101.10s]  Queen, seems that you failed to notice
[11101.10s -> 11106.11s]  a giant freaking robot in the middle of my palace.
[11106.11s -> 11109.11s]  This isn't good, she's invincible like this.
[11109.11s -> 11110.68s]  Huh?
[11110.68s -> 11113.32s]  She's been bragging about her final form all day.
[11116.40s -> 11119.12s]  Think growing a few inches is gonna help?
[11119.12s -> 11121.10s]  Yes.
[11125.34s -> 11128.51s]  Are we cool to take over the world now?
[11128.51s -> 11129.75s]  Susie, let's just give up,
[11129.75s -> 11133.21s]  and hell if we're giving up now.
[11133.21s -> 11136.10s]  Susie, what if you got another form?
[11136.10s -> 11137.06s]  We've got one too.
[11137.98s -> 11142.78s]  Chris, Rousey, come on.
[11142.78s -> 11145.44s]  God, what are you guys doing?
[11145.44s -> 11147.48s]  This is our ultimate.
[11147.48s -> 11149.52s]  Wait a second, now that you mention it.
[11149.52s -> 11152.54s]  Oh no, it appears I'm evenly matched.
[11152.54s -> 11159.99s]  I hope you won't mind if I don't hold back.
[11159.99s -> 11160.83s]  We're falling.
[11162.27s -> 11165.46s]  Any bright ideas on how we're gonna get out of this?
[11165.46s -> 11167.90s]  We could try flapping our arms.
[11167.90s -> 11172.78s]  Fear not, your knight in glow in the dark armor is here.
[11172.78s -> 11175.94s]  Early?
[11175.94s -> 11178.58s]  Chris, Susie, my energy is still too low
[11178.58s -> 11181.74s]  to help you fight, so I found help for you.
[11181.74s -> 11186.62s]  Behold, comrades, on your quest against the queen,
[11186.62s -> 11188.78s]  you've made all sorts of buddies, right?
[11188.78s -> 11192.62s]  Using our junk-making skills, we modify everyone
[11192.62s -> 11194.34s]  to work together.
[11194.34s -> 11197.35s]  I shall take credit for this.
[11197.35s -> 11200.65s]  The man of a million voices, five.
[11200.65s -> 11206.18s]  Chris, Susie, behold, the ultimate group project
[11206.18s -> 11209.07s]  with a splendid base.
[11209.07s -> 11211.07s]  My strongest JPEGs.
[11211.07s -> 11211.99s]  Oh wait, no.
[11211.99s -> 11215.24s]  My strongest JPEGs.
[11215.24s -> 11217.66s]  Flashing lights.
[11217.66s -> 11218.86s]  Happy bravery.
[11222.92s -> 11228.02s]  My energy.
[11228.02s -> 11230.43s]  Tender loving care.
[11230.43s -> 11232.70s]  Fresh cooking.
[11232.70s -> 11234.86s]  Organization.
[11234.86s -> 11254.51s]  And most of all, whatever's missing in.
[11254.51s -> 11257.10s]  Oh my goodness, what is going on now?
[11257.10s -> 11261.86s]  Finally, a worthy opponent.
[11261.86s -> 11262.70s]  What?
[11262.74s -> 11264.18s]  Oh shit, here we go.
[11264.18s -> 11266.82s]  It's the fighting game.
[11266.82s -> 11270.36s]  Giga Queen blocks the way.
[11270.36s -> 11272.21s]  All right, Giga Queen.
[11272.21s -> 11274.33s]  Laser mode turbo dodge.
[11274.33s -> 11279.73s]  Self-fix.
[11279.73s -> 11283.03s]  Did I attack?
[11283.03s -> 11292.08s]  Or should I build TP and then do the other stuff?
[11292.08s -> 11297.96s]  Oh, time for the words is, the time for words is over.
[11300.36s -> 11301.96s]  Now is time to fight only.
[11303.49s -> 11306.79s]  Oh fuck, I didn't know we were doing this right now.
[11306.79s -> 11308.78s]  What are the buttons?
[11308.78s -> 11313.12s]  What are the buttons?
[11313.12s -> 11315.00s]  Cityscape roars past.
[11315.00s -> 11315.84s]  All right, Giga Queen.
[11315.84s -> 11320.83s]  All right, let's go.
[11320.83s -> 11322.51s]  Just kidding, I totally will keep monologuing
[11322.51s -> 11335.34s]  as I kick at your face.
[11335.34s -> 11337.62s]  Nice.
[11337.62s -> 11340.98s]  The night is young for fighting.
[11340.98s -> 11342.82s]  Self-fix, how am I doing?
[11342.82s -> 11348.38s]  I think I got plenty of health.
[11348.38s -> 11352.58s]  Time has come for Noelle to realize her own strength.
[11352.58s -> 11360.26s]  Her own will, her own determination.
[11360.26s -> 11365.74s]  Fuckhead.
[11365.74s -> 11368.10s]  Rousey advises you to dodge then counterpunch.
[11368.10s -> 11374.64s]  What do you think I've been doing?
[11374.64s -> 11380.37s]  Uh-oh.
[11380.37s -> 11381.53s]  Focusing into her blade,
[11381.57s -> 11384.21s]  she will create a neo-dark fountain.
[11384.21s -> 11396.33s]  Then another, then another.
[11396.33s -> 11399.86s]  Oh wait, it's one, one, one, one, one.
[11399.86s -> 11406.48s]  Queen's attacks just got tougher.
[11406.48s -> 11408.24s]  Then when the whole world is covered in darkness,
[11408.24s -> 11410.00s]  she and everyone can live in bliss
[11410.00s -> 11411.64s]  free of fear and suffering.
[11420.21s -> 11422.33s]  Okay, I gotta learn the fight.
[11422.33s -> 11427.03s]  Self-fix.
[11427.03s -> 11428.67s]  First Susie, why don't you help me to
[11428.67s -> 11442.83s]  create the world of your dreams and not of my dreams?
[11442.83s -> 11445.61s]  Susie, bro, just let me karate chop you
[11445.61s -> 11455.82s]  and you can have as many skateboards as you want.
[11456.70s -> 11461.35s]  Um, laser mode?
[11461.35s -> 11463.15s]  Laser mode.
[11463.15s -> 11466.75s]  Light quick aura fired up.
[11466.75s -> 11468.03s]  Oh shit.
[11468.03s -> 11471.69s]  And Chris, my dearest Trucy, you can have as many?
[11471.69s -> 11477.54s]  Hey, I don't remember what you liked.
[11477.54s -> 11482.38s]  Ah, phase three incoming.
[11483.38s -> 11485.26s]  Oh, it hurt.
[11485.26s -> 11493.14s]  Gotta heal.
[11493.14s -> 11494.10s]  Round three.
[11494.10s -> 11496.18s]  The attacks are extreme now.
[11496.18s -> 11498.06s]  All right, I need 30% TP.
[11498.06s -> 11502.68s]  Get it right here.
[11502.68s -> 11506.63s]  Hey, was there a third guy?
[11506.63s -> 11511.14s]  Ah!
[11511.14s -> 11516.64s]  Oh, I go through the legs.
[11516.64s -> 11518.28s]  Shit, I need more turbo dodge.
[11518.28s -> 11522.83s]  No.
[11522.83s -> 11525.07s]  Join me and all of you will become super strong and cool.
[11525.07s -> 11526.47s]  Meanwhile, I don't need to improve
[11526.47s -> 11527.51s]  because I'm already perfecting
[11527.51s -> 11535.89s]  to shoot lasers from my fancy glass.
[11535.89s -> 11537.74s]  Shit.
[11537.74s -> 11544.45s]  Shit, let me give me a chance to fucking hit ya.
[11544.45s -> 11545.53s]  I believe I've made my point.
[11545.53s -> 11547.77s]  I'm going to procedurally loop my dialogue now.
[11547.77s -> 11571.23s]  Here we go.
[11571.23s -> 11574.93s]  Whoa, that was a new move.
[11574.93s -> 11575.77s]  All right, turbo dodge?
[11575.77s -> 11576.69s]  No.
[11576.69s -> 11591.10s]  Again.
[11591.10s -> 11592.18s]  All right, now it's time to heal again.
[11592.18s -> 11593.54s]  No, yes, heal.
[11593.54s -> 11594.38s]  Heal!
[11594.38s -> 11602.50s]  Heal!
[11602.50s -> 11614.53s]  Hey!
[11615.37s -> 11617.65s]  You have truly proven yourself to be worthy of learning.
[11617.65s -> 11618.93s]  You have earned the right to remember
[11618.93s -> 11621.21s]  what your fighting machine's true purpose is.
[11621.21s -> 11624.21s]  To get your own ass thrashed by me.
[11624.21s -> 11625.89s]  That's my final attack.
[11625.89s -> 11635.22s]  Bye.
[11635.22s -> 11638.72s]  Shit.
[11638.72s -> 11642.51s]  What the fuck is an Omega Baseball?
[11642.51s -> 11650.74s]  I get it.
[11650.74s -> 11652.10s]  Battle power dropping.
[11653.06s -> 11656.43s]  Overheat activated.
[11656.43s -> 11657.91s]  Listen well.
[11657.91s -> 11659.75s]  You may have defeated me,
[11659.75s -> 11662.79s]  but I still possess one thing.
[11662.91s -> 11668.02s]  You three will never have.
[11668.02s -> 11673.20s]  Detachable hands.
[11673.20s -> 11676.69s]  Was I supposed to punch that?
[11676.69s -> 11683.21s]  Did I lose?
[11683.21s -> 11694.42s]  Noel, honey, sweetie.
[11694.42s -> 11705.46s]  Gravy, take the pin I gave you
[11705.46s -> 11710.95s]  and stab the earth, creating our new supreme empire.
[11712.70s -> 11713.54s]  I.
[11714.70s -> 11716.54s]  What's wrong, Noel?
[11716.54s -> 11719.11s]  I know it would make you happy.
[11719.11s -> 11722.55s]  Or should I, with the last 1% of my battery,
[11723.55s -> 11731.78s]  push Susie into eight bits?
[11731.78s -> 11734.53s]  Leave?
[11734.53s -> 11736.13s]  Leave Susie alone!
[11736.13s -> 11738.85s]  You think listening to you makes me happy?
[11738.85s -> 11741.77s]  No, I'll never be happy if I'm controlled by you.
[11741.77s -> 11746.34s]  Why can't you understand that?
[11746.34s -> 11747.62s]  That was acting class.
[11747.62s -> 11748.54s]  That was like, okay, if you have a room
[11748.54s -> 11753.54s]  with like 100 people in an acting workshop,
[11753.54s -> 11755.22s]  that's like, that was like how I did it, you know,
[11755.22s -> 11758.26s]  in my acting classes.
[11758.26s -> 11763.03s]  Sometimes you just like, you blow out like the first workshop
[11763.03s -> 11764.83s]  and then like when you get the second assignment,
[11764.83s -> 11766.59s]  like you go nuts, you're a fucking lightning rod.
[11767.43s -> 11768.39s]  You act your ass off in the first like 20 minutes,
[11768.39s -> 11771.67s]  30 minutes of the class and you don't want to do anymore
[11771.67s -> 11775.55s]  and you're kind of just done.
[11775.55s -> 11783.11s]  I'm not gonna go like 100 miles per hour again.
[11783.11s -> 11785.75s]  Perhaps my computations were miscalibrated.
[11792.87s -> 11796.99s]  Noel, disregard me and with your own power,
[11796.99s -> 11803.99s]  choose the world that makes you happy.
[11803.99s -> 11805.50s]  Queen?
[11805.50s -> 11806.90s]  Queen?
[11806.90s -> 11808.18s]  Queen, are you okay?
[11809.55s -> 11812.57s]  Seems she ran out of battery power.
[11812.57s -> 11819.82s]  Guess we can seal the fountain now, right?
[11819.82s -> 11822.18s]  Everybody?
[11824.85s -> 11829.26s]  Queen, she said, choose the world that makes you happy.
[11829.26s -> 11832.67s]  Don't want to live in a world ruled by her.
[11832.67s -> 11834.23s]  That wasn't the case.
[11834.23s -> 11839.72s]  Wonder if this world wouldn't be so bad.
[11839.72s -> 11846.21s]  Huh, Lucy, don't you think so too?
[11846.21s -> 11847.97s]  Oh, you mentioned it.
[11847.97s -> 11851.10s]  Chris, isn't this world just better?
[11851.10s -> 11854.95s]  You make so many friends here, you know?
[11854.95s -> 11857.61s]  I've never had an adventure like this before.
[11857.61s -> 11860.90s]  Axes and battles and magic.
[11860.90s -> 11864.30s]  Everything can be healed with a little spell
[11864.30s -> 11867.22s]  and no matter what happens, no one tells us what to do.
[11868.75s -> 11870.39s]  Gosh, yeah.
[11870.39s -> 11873.11s]  So even if things were really scary just now,
[11873.11s -> 11880.59s]  I mean, is there any reason not to?
[11880.59s -> 11881.87s]  Not that I can think of.
[11882.75s -> 11884.31s]  Me neither.
[11884.31s -> 11892.54s]  Then, Noel, let this be my real apology.
[11892.54s -> 11894.86s]  Concentrating my will into this blade,
[11894.86s -> 11899.42s]  I will make a new fountain and unleash a bright future.
[11899.42s -> 11902.06s]  A future that shines for us.
[11902.06s -> 11906.22s]  A future whose brightness is born from darkness.
[11906.22s -> 11909.98s]  Stop.
[11909.98s -> 11916.69s]  What in the world are you all doing?
[11918.49s -> 11919.33s]  Stop.
[11920.21s -> 11921.41s]  Stop.
[11921.41s -> 11925.02s]  You realize what will happen if you do that?
[11925.02s -> 11928.96s]  You'll just, you'll bring the roaring.
[11937.10s -> 11942.92s]  When the light is subsumed by shadow,
[11942.92s -> 11949.46s]  when the fountains fill the sky,
[11949.46s -> 11954.52s]  all will fall into chaos.
[11954.52s -> 11956.65s]  I can do anything.
[11956.65s -> 11963.69s]  Titans will take form from the fountains
[11963.81s -> 11973.02s]  and envelop the land in devastation.
[11973.02s -> 11974.82s]  I had an opportunity to do that in Armand's voice
[11974.82s -> 11975.94s]  because it's like the Armand voice
[11975.94s -> 11977.18s]  I've been doing the whole game.
[11977.18s -> 11982.37s]  Surviving darkners crushed by the darkness
[11982.37s -> 11988.82s]  will slowly, one by one, turn into statues,
[11988.82s -> 11994.74s]  leaving the lighteners to fend for themselves,
[11994.74s -> 11999.51s]  lost eternally in an endless nightmare.
[11999.51s -> 12002.51s]  I thought it was gonna be a nightmare.
[12002.51s -> 12016.48s]  Is that your idea of paradise?
[12017.44s -> 12019.40s]  Oh, damn, I did not know that.
[12021.39s -> 12022.83s]  You didn't?
[12022.83s -> 12025.11s]  But your whole plan was to...
[12025.11s -> 12028.55s]  I'm just a computer laughing my fucking ass off.
[12028.55s -> 12030.79s]  I didn't, I don't know everything.
[12030.79s -> 12034.02s]  I was just guessing based off the night's actions.
[12034.02s -> 12037.30s]  Why the heck, hell, would I want to end the world?
[12038.74s -> 12039.58s]  That's a relief.
[12042.29s -> 12044.49s]  Sorry, I, after everything,
[12044.49s -> 12048.03s]  I just caused trouble for you again, Noel.
[12048.03s -> 12049.99s]  That's okay, Birdly, I understand.
[12049.99s -> 12052.51s]  I thought about it while charging my battery.
[12052.51s -> 12055.92s]  You cannot calculate other people's feelings.
[12055.92s -> 12058.50s]  You understand how I feel?
[12058.50s -> 12059.34s]  Not really.
[12060.86s -> 12063.89s]  I just don't want Noel to be sad.
[12063.89s -> 12067.64s]  Well, I'm glad you two kind of get it now.
[12067.64s -> 12070.24s]  Yes, we all made a pretty sweet team in the end.
[12073.90s -> 12076.86s]  I was just the judge in the acid.
[12079.42s -> 12080.70s]  No, we freaking didn't.
[12081.70s -> 12084.00s]  Can you let go of us now?
[12085.48s -> 12086.32s]  Oh, yeah.
[12093.10s -> 12093.94s]  Suzie?
[12094.98s -> 12097.18s]  Hey, you stood up to the queen, not half bad.
[12098.34s -> 12100.06s]  Really?
[12100.94s -> 12101.78s]  Yeah.
[12102.94s -> 12105.22s]  Just guess you gotta wake up soon, huh?
[12106.14s -> 12107.38s]  Huh?
[12107.38s -> 12110.88s]  Everything got so intense, I forgot it was a dream.
[12110.88s -> 12114.72s]  And I just hope I get to have more dreams like this.
[12114.72s -> 12118.31s]  Hey, Noel, when you wake up,
[12118.31s -> 12119.15s]  when you wake up,
[12120.61s -> 12121.97s]  well, I just wanted to say.
[12127.10s -> 12130.76s]  Well, then I suppose it is time for you all to exit.
[12130.76s -> 12132.96s]  Running program, tendergoodbye.exe.
[12134.00s -> 12137.04s]  I will miss each and every one of you.
[12137.04s -> 12139.16s]  Well, your unneeded honesty.
[12139.16s -> 12141.24s]  Suzie, your foolish bravery.
[12141.24s -> 12142.68s]  Chris, your chill vibes.
[12145.70s -> 12147.62s]  Birdly.
[12147.62s -> 12149.90s]  Doesn't have to be goodbye, queen.
[12149.90s -> 12153.02s]  Chris can take you back to our castle town.
[12153.02s -> 12155.02s]  You and all our recruits can live there.
[12155.67s -> 12156.51s]  Oh.
[12157.95s -> 12159.51s]  Leading tendergoodbye.exe.
[12161.88s -> 12165.17s]  All right, time to do what we came here for.
[12165.17s -> 12167.89s]  Hey, Noel, if you see the real Suzie,
[12167.89s -> 12172.45s]  just know that maybe she's.
[12172.45s -> 12174.37s]  Look, she doesn't have a tail, okay?
[12176.46s -> 12177.30s]  Okay, got it.
[12178.86s -> 12182.11s]  Just go, Chris.
[12182.11s -> 12200.27s]  Everybody's laughing.
[12200.27s -> 12201.11s]  Chris.
[12203.22s -> 12205.54s]  Looks like we're here again.
[12208.07s -> 12209.15s]  Roaring night.
[12212.40s -> 12213.24s]  Whatever they are.
[12214.28s -> 12215.76s]  We're making these fountains.
[12220.58s -> 12226.75s]  But is that really a bad thing?
[12226.75s -> 12230.75s]  Since they started showing up,
[12230.75s -> 12238.98s]  everything's gotten a lot more interesting, hasn't it?
[12238.98s -> 12243.18s]  Well, we don't have to think about it that now.
[12245.86s -> 12246.78s]  I'm doing Obama?
[12248.06s -> 12250.25s]  I'm not trying to.
[12250.25s -> 12256.46s]  Chris, it's your turn.
[12256.50s -> 12259.74s]  It was as if your very soul was going.
[12274.31s -> 12281.70s]  Guitar riff.
[12281.70s -> 12282.54s]  Okay.
[12284.18s -> 12286.05s]  What happened?
[12286.05s -> 12287.69s]  Oh, it was a dream, wasn't it?
[12289.21s -> 12290.78s]  A dream?
[12290.78s -> 12293.35s]  That was all a dream?
[12294.35s -> 12297.11s]  Of course, that must have been a dream.
[12297.11s -> 12298.87s]  Such feelings, such thoughts.
[12298.87s -> 12302.02s]  Oh, sweet lady of justice.
[12302.02s -> 12305.61s]  You think I would ever think Suzie would be.
[12305.61s -> 12307.42s]  Suzie?
[12307.42s -> 12309.22s]  Suzie?
[12309.22s -> 12310.42s]  What are you doing here?
[12313.18s -> 12316.88s]  You invited us to study, remember?
[12316.88s -> 12317.72s]  Oh, right.
[12319.04s -> 12321.12s]  What, studying with them?
[12321.12s -> 12322.24s]  Noelle?
[12322.24s -> 12326.00s]  Heavens to yikes, they're...
[12326.00s -> 12330.50s]  Well, I guess we could try it.
[12331.79s -> 12333.84s]  My alarm.
[12333.84s -> 12337.66s]  I'm gonna be late for shift with Miss Boom.
[12337.66s -> 12339.42s]  Oh no, how is it that late already?
[12340.72s -> 12342.32s]  Well, adieu everyone.
[12342.32s -> 12345.65s]  I must gather my book longings.
[12345.65s -> 12349.48s]  How I love the texture of freshly picked up books.
[12349.48s -> 12357.43s]  Now, let us hasten, my dear Noelle.
[12357.43s -> 12362.10s]  Good day, Chris, Suzie.
[12362.10s -> 12363.10s]  Bye, Chris.
[12363.10s -> 12365.09s]  And bye, Suzie.
[12366.65s -> 12372.77s]  See ya.
[12372.77s -> 12375.41s]  What, what are you looking at for something?
[12375.41s -> 12379.76s]  Nothing, nothing, nothing, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.
[12379.76s -> 12381.72s]  I think it's her problem anyway.
[12381.72s -> 12384.94s]  When you treat someone who just saved the world.
[12384.94s -> 12386.38s]  Look at me.
[12386.38s -> 12387.22s]  Chris.
[12387.22s -> 12389.06s]  Hey, wait a second, Chris.
[12389.06s -> 12391.89s]  We just actually saved the world, didn't we?
[12393.37s -> 12395.17s]  Damn, we really are heroes.
[12395.17s -> 12397.29s]  And no one even knows.
[12397.29s -> 12399.94s]  This is better that way though, right?
[12399.94s -> 12402.06s]  Freak out if they knew the world's in danger.
[12403.62s -> 12406.45s]  Well, it kind of sucks Noelle has to forget too.
[12407.85s -> 12414.36s]  Whatever, let's get out of here.
[12414.36s -> 12415.40s]  The recycling bin.
[12415.40s -> 12417.00s]  Looks like someone accidentally printed off
[12417.00s -> 12422.62s]  a lot of useless emails.
[12422.62s -> 12424.82s]  Full of many backup devices like extra mice,
[12424.82s -> 12429.28s]  extra keyboards, or extra maracas.
[12429.28s -> 12431.26s]  What's back here?
[12431.26s -> 12434.63s]  Closet is spacious and full of old electronics.
[12434.63s -> 12438.02s]  Large person could easily fit inside.
[12438.02s -> 12441.61s]  Computer, the monitor is flickering brightly.
[12441.65s -> 12442.85s]  The trash can, you get the feeling
[12442.85s -> 12444.49s]  it doesn't have any friends.
[12444.49s -> 12453.37s]  Hard to explain why you feel this way about a trash can.
[12453.37s -> 12466.37s]  Before you left, you gathered up everything in the room.
[12466.37s -> 12471.60s]  I love reading books, especially the books upstairs.
[12471.60s -> 12474.87s]  I love reading, especially books.
[12474.87s -> 12484.26s]  I love reading books.
[12484.26s -> 12486.48s]  Man, it got late, didn't it?
[12487.68s -> 12489.12s]  Guess you should go home, huh?
[12491.06s -> 12494.87s]  All right, you don't have to say it.
[12494.87s -> 12496.79s]  Don't wanna walk home by yourself, huh?
[12497.79s -> 12499.87s]  Well, if you're gonna make me, I guess.
[12500.83s -> 12512.41s]  Let's go.
[12512.49s -> 12514.13s]  You're gonna make an apartment?
[12514.13s -> 12515.92s]  Nah, just here to hang out.
[12515.92s -> 12516.76s]  I see.
[12516.76s -> 12520.98s]  I can actually go in all the way in here.
[12522.49s -> 12526.30s]  Silver, Drake, I've never beaten this boss before.
[12526.30s -> 12528.94s]  All right, hand it over, honey, I got this.
[12528.94s -> 12530.74s]  No, Dad, this is my battle.
[12530.74s -> 12534.86s]  So, how about just telling me what to do?
[12534.86s -> 12537.98s]  Sure, how about trying fire shock?
[12537.98s -> 12540.63s]  I'd love to, Dad, but the mage left the party.
[12540.63s -> 12545.27s]  Oh yeah, how about one of your 99 blaze potions?
[12545.27s -> 12547.19s]  Oh, I'm saving those.
[12547.19s -> 12548.03s]  What, your birthday?
[12548.03s -> 12550.07s]  Come on, little, little.
[12550.11s -> 12551.43s]  Hey, Dad, this one's for you.
[12551.43s -> 12555.45s]  Hi-ya, it reflects fire attacks.
[12557.05s -> 12559.13s]  Oops, hey, you gotta heal.
[12560.38s -> 12563.85s]  I wish I knew healing magic in real life
[12563.85s -> 12564.85s]  that it'd make you better,
[12564.85s -> 12570.78s]  and it wouldn't just be me and Mom.
[12570.78s -> 12573.18s]  Your mother is, hey, it's okay, sweetheart,
[12573.18s -> 12574.90s]  I'm getting better.
[12574.90s -> 12578.26s]  I might even be able to go to church tomorrow.
[12578.26s -> 12581.97s]  Really, are you sure you're okay?
[12581.97s -> 12584.94s]  Holidays happen whether you like it or not.
[12584.94s -> 12587.59s]  Even though everyone likes holidays?
[12587.59s -> 12592.04s]  Well, gotta go home soon or Mom will call.
[12592.04s -> 12593.24s]  See you tomorrow, honey.
[12594.36s -> 12596.68s]  Hi, Dad, love you.
[12596.68s -> 12599.18s]  Susie, what are you doing here?
[12599.18s -> 12602.38s]  All right, guys, this game's only one player.
[12602.38s -> 12604.54s]  Dad, this is Susie.
[12604.54s -> 12606.46s]  Oh, this is Susie.
[12606.46s -> 12608.66s]  Susie, and I heard a lot about you.
[12608.66s -> 12610.58s]  Dad, stop that.
[12610.58s -> 12612.18s]  You have?
[12612.18s -> 12616.89s]  Cool, think I have to go now.
[12616.89s -> 12617.73s]  Susie, huh?
[12620.80s -> 12623.62s]  Lay a finger on her and I'll kick your ass.
[12623.62s -> 12624.94s]  Huh?
[12625.62s -> 12626.54s]  I'm just kidding.
[12627.42s -> 12636.95s]  Well, kind of kidding.
[12636.95s -> 12639.85s]  Hey, Chris, why are you checking the sink?
[12639.85s -> 12643.09s]  That's what I'm asking, sweetheart.
[12643.09s -> 12645.45s]  I don't know.
[12645.45s -> 12649.42s]  Sorry, I used up a lot of my energy just now.
[12649.42s -> 12652.42s]  Probably not gonna be very fun to talk to.
[12652.42s -> 12654.58s]  Thanks for visiting, though, Chris.
[12654.58s -> 12657.45s]  And you too, Susie.
[12657.45s -> 12658.81s]  Susie, current situation?
[12658.81s -> 12662.46s]  No, well, current situation?
[12662.46s -> 12664.70s]  Seems like I need some more tests.
[12664.70s -> 12666.50s]  So just gotta wait it out.
[12666.50s -> 12669.46s]  They can't keep me down for too long, baby.
[12669.46s -> 12671.42s]  Sooner or later, I'm busting out of here.
[12674.14s -> 12680.79s]  Besides, your dad ain't much without his main man.
[12680.79s -> 12681.99s]  What does this say?
[12681.99s -> 12685.66s]  Is your name Rudolph Rudy Holliday?
[12685.66s -> 12699.39s]  Hey, Chris, you forgot my name or something?
[12699.39s -> 12704.75s]  Looks like she's resting her voice.
[12704.75s -> 12706.23s]  Look inside the cupboard.
[12706.23s -> 12708.83s]  Very small obligatory piano is hiding inside.
[12712.27s -> 12718.14s]  Okay.
[12718.14s -> 12719.94s]  Well, Chris, you can play the piano.
[12725.13s -> 12727.51s]  Whoops.
[12727.51s -> 12728.35s]  There's more?
[12728.35s -> 12729.19s]  Yeah.
[12729.19s -> 12736.11s]  Let's just see what else is here.
[12736.95s -> 12737.79s]  Susie.
[12737.79s -> 12740.34s]  Hey, Chris, she's a nice girl, huh?
[12740.34s -> 12741.30s]  The hell are you talking,
[12741.30s -> 12744.34s]  the hell are you taking her here for?
[12744.34s -> 12746.14s]  Why don't you take her to the movies?
[12747.14s -> 12750.95s]  Hey, yeah, the hell didn't we go to the movies, Chris?
[12750.95s -> 12753.51s]  Yeah, and take me too while you're at it.
[12753.51s -> 12755.26s]  Yeah, Chris, come on.
[12755.26s -> 12756.46s]  Kettle corn, Chris, big.
[12756.46s -> 12760.10s]  Don't skimp out.
[12760.10s -> 12760.94s]  What is it?
[12760.94s -> 12764.38s]  Crispus.
[12764.38s -> 12766.38s]  Look, Chris, can't say much, but,
[12766.38s -> 12768.70s]  well, might look like she has it all.
[12768.70s -> 12771.06s]  Her mother, mother, you know.
[12771.06s -> 12774.14s]  Love her, but she's tough on her.
[12774.14s -> 12776.98s]  Normally, I balance it all out.
[12776.98s -> 12779.62s]  I can't do much when I'm not there.
[12779.62s -> 12780.86s]  I'm gonna get better.
[12780.86s -> 12792.61s]  I have to.
[12792.61s -> 12798.84s]  Bees of the toy march on.
[12798.84s -> 12802.32s]  Uh-oh, Alfie's, hell if I'm gonna go any further.
[12802.32s -> 12805.20s]  Already close enough to getting banned from school.
[12805.20s -> 12808.36s]  Don't wanna be banned from outside of school, too.
[12808.36s -> 12813.32s]  That's a thing, right?
[12813.32s -> 12815.20s]  Hi, Chris, getting your project done?
[12816.36s -> 12820.76s]  Oh, my bike, it's, I had a little crash.
[12820.76s -> 12822.48s]  You see, there was this police officer
[12822.48s -> 12829.70s]  and it's complicated, how are you doing?
[12829.70s -> 12832.66s]  Chris, it's no secret, the police in this town are,
[12832.66s -> 12833.94s]  how do I put this?
[12833.94s -> 12836.74s]  Just eye candy, I guess.
[12836.74s -> 12838.42s]  Wait, wait, wait, I came out wrong.
[12838.42s -> 12841.22s]  I mean, they're symbolic, they barely do anything.
[12841.22s -> 12845.46s]  It's because of the mayor, there isn't any crime.
[12845.46s -> 12848.06s]  Makes me wonder if she even needs the police
[12848.06s -> 12850.90s]  or if they're just getting in her way.
[12850.90s -> 12853.10s]  Sorry, I'm just saying what you already know.
[12853.10s -> 12857.53s]  After all, she's your neighbor, right?
[12857.53s -> 12859.00s]  Did you need something?
[12859.00s -> 12860.92s]  What's cool?
[12860.92s -> 12863.44s]  How's your project going with Susie?
[12863.44s -> 12865.56s]  What, you went to the library together?
[12865.56s -> 12866.56s]  With Noelle and Birdley?
[12866.56s -> 12868.20s]  That's amazing, Chris.
[12868.20s -> 12871.00s]  And while you were there, this has nothing to do with me,
[12871.00s -> 12874.48s]  but the Teen Zone seems to have some good anime reviews,
[12874.48s -> 12877.44s]  you know, I'm not sure if you and the gang were,
[12877.44s -> 12880.04s]  I'd check that out as you studied the anime.
[12880.04s -> 12882.48s]  Next time you go, you might want to casually bring that up
[12882.48s -> 12884.36s]  among your fellow teens.
[12884.36s -> 12887.12s]  I know your dad liked Miu Miu 2, at least.
[12887.16s -> 12893.72s]  Again, nothing to do with me, yeah.
[12893.72s -> 12900.30s]  We're the infamous dog burglars, the Wet Nose Bandits.
[12900.30s -> 12902.14s]  We're getting ready to sneak into that big house
[12902.14s -> 12903.70s]  over the holidays.
[12903.70s -> 12906.98s]  We were attacked from the shadows by something merciless.
[12906.98s -> 12909.86s]  Fearing for our lives, we ran right into the office,
[12909.86s -> 12912.42s]  Undyne's warm, loving arms.
[12912.42s -> 12914.54s]  She suplexed us all into the snow
[12914.54s -> 12916.98s]  with our tails hanging in the air.
[12916.98s -> 12919.98s]  Now we're in jail, but at least we're alive.
[12919.98s -> 12922.22s]  Plus, that nice ghost keeps giving us
[12922.38s -> 12925.14s]  corporately low-calorie treats.
[12925.14s -> 12928.16s]  And we all howl holiday songs together.
[12928.16s -> 12931.07s]  Oh, oh, oh!
[12931.07s -> 12932.07s]  Did I say that key?
[12934.44s -> 12935.64s]  Hey, get out of the road!
[12935.64s -> 12937.32s]  Oh, sorry, bad habit.
[12937.32s -> 12939.88s]  Anything I can help you with, punk?
[12939.88s -> 12941.54s]  Dark World.
[12941.54s -> 12945.18s]  Oh, a super dangerous alternate world in the library?
[12945.18s -> 12947.78s]  More are appearing, people might fall inside.
[12949.88s -> 12953.04s]  Listen, punk, you seriously think I'm gonna believe that?
[12954.00s -> 12954.84s]  Dark World.
[12954.92s -> 12956.08s]  Oh, seriously?
[12968.67s -> 12970.95s]  I love those guys, I hope they show up.
[12970.95s -> 12971.79s]  Hey, wait.
[12973.23s -> 12975.15s]  No, not again.
[12975.15s -> 12978.78s]  Looks like I gotta go recap to those criminals.
[12978.78s -> 12981.82s]  Hey, by the way, that yellow glasses lady,
[12981.82s -> 12984.38s]  she a teacher, she kinda had an accident earlier
[12984.38s -> 12986.10s]  with her bike.
[12986.10s -> 12988.86s]  Just wanted to make sure she was feeling better.
[12988.86s -> 12990.38s]  Give her this.
[12990.38s -> 12992.14s]  Got a heart-shaped box of candies that says,
[12992.18s -> 12993.02s]  Get Well Soon.
[12994.02s -> 12996.98s]  It has to, it has to your bike hastily scrawled
[12996.98s -> 12999.80s]  underneath the Get Well Soon.
[12999.80s -> 13002.64s]  Look, Get Well Soon's all the store had.
[13002.64s -> 13005.16s]  Open it and I'll arrest you, look.
[13005.16s -> 13006.60s]  I'll even put a note on it.
[13006.60s -> 13008.60s]  Now stop interrupting me, I gotta go.
[13008.60s -> 13010.50s]  Got the previously described box of candy
[13010.50s -> 13015.90s]  with a note on it.
[13015.90s -> 13018.06s]  Oh, jailbreak.
[13018.06s -> 13045.02s]  I'll solve the alarm.
[13045.02s -> 13048.39s]  I gotta go, wait no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[13048.39s -> 13049.55s]  I gotta get the candy, I gotta get the candy,
[13049.55s -> 13053.34s]  candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy.
[13053.34s -> 13056.46s]  Candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy, candy.
[13057.30s -> 13058.14s]  Do you have something for me?
[13058.14s -> 13061.91s]  Here.
[13061.91s -> 13064.47s]  Oh, Chris, what is that you're giving me?
[13064.47s -> 13067.13s]  A box of heart-shaped chocolates?
[13067.13s -> 13069.89s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, I can't accept that from you.
[13069.89s -> 13072.23s]  What, it's from the police?
[13072.23s -> 13077.23s]  You mean she's giving me this Get Well Soon gift to my bike?
[13078.76s -> 13080.08s]  There's a note on this that says,
[13080.08s -> 13083.12s]  open this and I'll arrest you, you little punk.
[13083.12s -> 13099.73s]  Chris, tell her I appreciate it.
[13099.73s -> 13101.09s]  Hey, Chris, shouldn't we check on Lancer?
[13101.09s -> 13108.92s]  You should be back in the school closet, right?
[13108.92s -> 13110.49s]  Sant!
[13110.53s -> 13112.74s]  Oh, oh!
[13112.74s -> 13118.79s]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, what's up?
[13118.79s -> 13119.63s]  Occupation.
[13120.63s -> 13122.15s]  Hey, you the boss around here?
[13123.27s -> 13124.11s]  Oh, me?
[13124.11s -> 13126.87s]  I'm just the janitor.
[13126.87s -> 13128.63s]  And where's the cashier?
[13128.63s -> 13130.27s]  Hey, cashier?
[13130.27s -> 13131.81s]  We don't have one.
[13133.63s -> 13135.15s]  And who do we buy stuff from?
[13136.71s -> 13139.17s]  Hey, me.
[13139.17s -> 13141.76s]  And that makes you the cashier?
[13141.76s -> 13144.40s]  Nope, I'm the janitor.
[13144.40s -> 13145.48s]  I'm just filling in.
[13146.32s -> 13150.78s]  Are there any other employees?
[13150.78s -> 13152.99s]  Nope.
[13152.99s -> 13155.71s]  And why don't you hire somebody else?
[13155.71s -> 13158.55s]  Whoa, you think I can afford that on a janitor salary?
[13158.55s -> 13159.39s]  It's Bertie.
[13159.39s -> 13160.23s]  Hey, I'll let you talk.
[13160.23s -> 13161.71s]  It's Bertie Sanders.
[13161.71s -> 13167.32s]  New voice, I'm trying to remember what I did last time.
[13167.32s -> 13168.16s]  Hey, what's up?
[13169.94s -> 13173.78s]  Sorry, kid, the brother thing's gonna have to wait.
[13173.78s -> 13175.18s]  How long?
[13175.18s -> 13177.58s]  Maybe a day, maybe another two years.
[13177.58s -> 13181.54s]  Who's keeping track at this point?
[13181.54s -> 13184.86s]  Hey, what's up?
[13185.66s -> 13187.82s]  Welcome to the convenience store.
[13187.82s -> 13188.98s]  You wanna buy something?
[13188.98s -> 13191.79s]  Put it in the basket and bring it over here.
[13191.79s -> 13202.84s]  In case you didn't know what the store was.
[13202.84s -> 13205.77s]  Hey, hey, you forgot something?
[13205.77s -> 13209.02s]  Yes, I think I left my eggs on the counter.
[13209.02s -> 13212.47s]  Guess your memory's not what it's cracked up to be.
[13212.47s -> 13213.99s]  Hee hee hee.
[13213.99s -> 13217.54s]  There's really egg on my face now, is there not?
[13217.54s -> 13220.75s]  You're egg-scused.
[13220.75s -> 13224.14s]  Now it sounds as if you're egging me on.
[13224.14s -> 13228.15s]  Egg on or egg off, I expect a lot from you.
[13228.15s -> 13230.95s]  Well, I am exceptional, hee hee hee.
[13230.95s -> 13233.27s]  Don't forget me, you're Egg's husband.
[13236.86s -> 13237.86s]  Hello, Asgore.
[13239.06s -> 13241.14s]  Hurry, I didn't expect to see you here,
[13241.14s -> 13246.84s]  but I have some extra flowers and I was wondering if...
[13246.84s -> 13249.32s]  Oh, I was just about to go, actually.
[13249.32s -> 13251.44s]  Oh, sure.
[13251.44s -> 13253.44s]  Home is where the heart is, isn't it?
[13255.79s -> 13258.81s]  So when Asriel comes home...
[13258.81s -> 13261.17s]  Yes, we should all discuss that together soon.
[13261.65s -> 13265.04s]  Donkey, donkey, say hi to Chris for me.
[13265.04s -> 13269.71s]  Of course, have a nice day.
[13270.87s -> 13273.63s]  You know what I want, bone man?
[13273.63s -> 13275.03s]  Uh, yep.
[13275.03s -> 13277.23s]  Free pickles.
[13277.23s -> 13279.24s]  Why, thank you.
[13279.24s -> 13284.20s]  Uh, can I ask, what kind of flowers do you think
[13284.20s -> 13288.14s]  would make her remember how she felt before?
[13288.14s -> 13291.70s]  Uh, maybe you should talk to your plants about that one.
[13291.70s -> 13293.30s]  Uh, I tarnished it.
[13293.30s -> 13295.26s]  Why, what happened?
[13296.06s -> 13298.70s]  Ha ha, don't worry, they're the first ones I asked.
[13299.54s -> 13301.70s]  They said good listeners, you know, flowers.
[13303.12s -> 13305.24s]  Well, yeah, nothing like a captive audience.
[13305.24s -> 13307.95s]  Ha ha, he's changing.
[13307.95s -> 13310.31s]  Yes, ha ha, I keep them in glass.
[13311.23s -> 13312.23s]  He's turning into...
[13312.23s -> 13316.36s]  What's he turning into?
[13316.36s -> 13320.32s]  Yes, ha ha, he's turning into Barney Rubble.
[13320.32s -> 13323.60s]  Uh, that's the same shit happened last time in Undertale.
[13323.60s -> 13324.88s]  Uh, like that movie.
[13325.88s -> 13328.08s]  Yes, yes, it's very similar to that movie.
[13329.58s -> 13330.98s]  Uh, well, have a good one.
[13332.18s -> 13333.18s]  I'm trying.
[13337.79s -> 13343.96s]  Hey Chris, um, nevermind.
[13343.96s -> 13346.16s]  Yeah, I'm the sicko that looks at all the milks
[13346.16s -> 13347.76s]  to find the best expiration date.
[13347.76s -> 13352.29s]  You got something about it?
[13352.29s -> 13354.89s]  Sometimes the hoofed girl comes here,
[13354.89s -> 13357.09s]  opens the freezer door, then stands in front of it
[13357.09s -> 13358.29s]  lost in thought.
[13358.29s -> 13360.29s]  I guess she really likes the cold or waffles.
[13366.01s -> 13370.01s]  Okay, well that's cool.
[13370.01s -> 13372.57s]  Sands runs the convenience store.
[13372.57s -> 13374.14s]  Can I do that?
[13374.14s -> 13375.54s]  Loose eggs, one dollar.
[13375.54s -> 13380.61s]  It's too much responsibility for an egg.
[13380.61s -> 13383.45s]  What time is it?
[13383.45s -> 13392.93s]  All right, I told the tip of the hats guys
[13392.93s -> 13397.54s]  that I was gonna be around around six,
[13397.54s -> 13399.14s]  and we're at six o'clock right now,
[13399.14s -> 13412.87s]  so am I almost done?
[13412.87s -> 13414.27s]  School has a save point.
[13414.27s -> 13416.10s]  Save your game in the school.
[13416.10s -> 13418.90s]  There's like 15 minutes left.
[13418.90s -> 13420.90s]  Let me just reel.
[13420.90s -> 13422.50s]  I'm gonna go to BRB screen for a second
[13422.50s -> 13425.28s]  because I wanna see how long they're gonna go for.
[13425.28s -> 13428.56s]  See if I can go another 15 minutes or so.
[13428.56s -> 13429.76s]  Give me one second.
[13429.76s -> 13431.16s]  I just wanna hit up...
[13431.16s -> 13441.02s]  I'll be right back, and I'm gonna pee too.
[13637.52s -> 13638.52s]  All righty.
[13638.52s -> 13641.60s]  I dropped a few messages to them.
[13641.60s -> 13646.05s]  We're gonna go until, I guess maybe they...
[13646.05s -> 13650.50s]  until somebody says, hey, come on over.
[13650.50s -> 13651.90s]  I think we have probably another 10 to 15 minutes,
[13651.90s -> 13653.10s]  so let's do it.
[13653.10s -> 13665.16s]  I'm gonna keep this open so I don't miss a message though.
[13665.16s -> 13665.96s]  All right.
[13665.96s -> 13668.16s]  Keep that open.
[13668.16s -> 13669.56s]  There we are.
[13669.56s -> 13671.36s]  Okay, good.
[13671.36s -> 13675.00s]  Go back to the school to save your game.
[13675.00s -> 13675.80s]  Okay.
[13675.80s -> 13679.84s]  You kids came out of the library, didn't you, studying?
[13679.84s -> 13681.04s]  How wonderful.
[13681.04s -> 13683.24s]  Personally, I hate libraries, but...
[13683.24s -> 13685.57s]  There's like 10 minutes left.
[13685.57s -> 13689.98s]  Yeah, I don't need to explore every single little thing.
[13689.98s -> 13691.38s]  If I wanna talk to every single citizen,
[13691.38s -> 13694.14s]  I can do that, like on my own time.
[13694.14s -> 13698.51s]  Faintly, faintly, a trussle growing further away.
[13698.51s -> 13699.31s]  Everyone?
[13699.31s -> 13708.37s]  Faintly, faintly, a trussle growing further away.
[13708.37s -> 13708.97s]  Knock, knock, knock.
[13708.97s -> 13710.37s]  Ooh, is that a human?
[13710.37s -> 13718.50s]  If humans are made of bones, where does skeletons come from?
[13718.50s -> 13719.90s]  All right, let's head to the school.
[13719.90s -> 13722.18s]  We'll complete it.
[13722.18s -> 13723.18s]  Somebody said you could have finished it
[13723.18s -> 13725.38s]  in the time that you've been gone?
[13725.38s -> 13727.78s]  Well, I wanted to tell them,
[13727.78s -> 13730.38s]  because we kind of said that around 6 o'clock.
[13730.38s -> 13733.08s]  I told them and see what they were up to.
[13733.08s -> 13735.52s]  I wanna make sure that I'm communicating, right?
[13735.52s -> 13738.52s]  Oh, hey, that's my trash from other people's houses.
[13738.52s -> 13739.72s]  Like, privacy much?
[13739.72s -> 13742.32s]  God, living with Azzie made you weird.
[13746.34s -> 13747.94s]  Like, a little Chrissy, you hear,
[13747.94s -> 13750.32s]  that guy at the pizza place.
[13750.32s -> 13751.12s]  God, what was his name?
[13751.12s -> 13753.08s]  Pizza Pants?
[13753.08s -> 13755.78s]  Already got, like, a super hot girlfriend.
[13755.78s -> 13756.38s]  What was her name?
[13756.38s -> 13759.98s]  Like, uh, pizza-rina?
[13759.98s -> 13763.40s]  Anyway, what did you, like, wanna talk?
[13763.40s -> 13766.94s]  Okay.
[13766.94s -> 13768.94s]  Chrissy, like, guess what?
[13768.94s -> 13771.74s]  Today, I, like, went to the beach to play with my uke,
[13771.74s -> 13774.91s]  and, like, guess who's already there?
[13774.91s -> 13778.31s]  That copycat playing the same song I wanted to play.
[13778.31s -> 13781.51s]  Oh, my God, cat on the beach, grody.
[13781.51s -> 13784.71s]  Did she, like, get lost looking for the litter box?
[13784.71s -> 13787.71s]  So, like, I try to, like, play the same song, too,
[13787.71s -> 13790.71s]  to, like, you know, assert my ukulele dominance,
[13790.71s -> 13792.91s]  and we end up, ugh, get this,
[13792.91s -> 13795.51s]  playing the whole song together.
[13795.51s -> 13799.14s]  Like, oh, my God, who does this girl think she is?
[13799.14s -> 13802.34s]  She thinks she can just, like, harmonize with me?
[13802.34s -> 13806.95s]  Uh, I can't stand her.
[13806.95s -> 13809.15s]  Little Chrissy, come to visit me.
[13809.15s -> 13812.44s]  I'm a real alligator, aren't I?
[13812.44s -> 13813.84s]  Oh, my God, it's, like, so sweet
[13813.84s -> 13816.44s]  you have a nasty, dirty little friend.
[13816.44s -> 13819.04s]  But, like, this is my polluted alleyway,
[13819.04s -> 13821.84s]  so, like, I think I might have to go to the mayor
[13821.84s -> 13825.42s]  and get a traffic sign that says, like, uh, no plus funds
[13825.42s -> 13827.90s]  because, like, okay.
[13827.90s -> 13829.10s]  What is that?
[13829.10s -> 13832.30s]  Hey, Chris, this free milk is amazing.
[13832.30s -> 13841.08s]  It just magically refreshes itself every night.
[13841.08s -> 13842.88s]  Hey, Chrissy, like, guess what?
[13842.88s -> 13851.27s]  Today, I, like, oh, wait, I already did this.
[13851.27s -> 13852.67s]  Okay, that's, all right, let's go.
[13852.67s -> 13854.27s]  I wanna explore!
[13854.27s -> 13857.11s]  All right, let's go to the school.
[13857.11s -> 13860.11s]  I'm gonna, let's go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[13860.11s -> 13862.91s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[13862.91s -> 13866.96s]  Whose house is this?
[13866.96s -> 13872.30s]  It's down?
[13872.30s -> 13879.62s]  Where's the school?
[13879.62s -> 13883.11s]  The school!
[13883.11s -> 13884.62s]  Oh, it's the church.
[13884.62s -> 13886.02s]  Just a spot.
[13886.02s -> 13888.18s]  Nothing like admiring the great paint job
[13888.18s -> 13890.38s]  me and my bro did on our church.
[13890.38s -> 13894.84s]  Haul, no sense of direction.
[13894.84s -> 13896.64s]  Well, I mean, I haven't been here in a long time.
[13896.64s -> 13900.76s]  Graveyard?
[13900.76s -> 13908.24s]  One of my best ideas came from the dreams.
[13908.24s -> 13914.39s]  You can rest here if anyone asks your writing.
[13914.39s -> 13915.99s]  He's confused west with east again.
[13915.99s -> 13918.19s]  I feel like I could literally walk around here
[13918.19s -> 13919.39s]  for, like, an hour and a half
[13919.39s -> 13920.79s]  and just listen to every single thing.
[13920.79s -> 13921.99s]  And I'm probably gonna do that.
[13921.99s -> 13928.85s]  I'll do that, like, later tonight before I go to bed.
[13928.85s -> 13932.69s]  I do want to be, I don't want to just cut into their time.
[13932.69s -> 13935.30s]  I did tell them a certain time.
[13935.30s -> 13939.01s]  Let's go ahead and end the process here.
[13939.01s -> 13952.07s]  Go right, down and left, right at the library to finish.
[13952.07s -> 13957.76s]  School is not the end.
[13957.76s -> 13959.76s]  Yeah, I have the game saved, like, 10 minutes before this,
[13959.76s -> 13962.42s]  so that's fine.
[13962.42s -> 13964.62s]  So this is, is the school ending game?
[13964.62s -> 13970.07s]  Just finish it?
[13970.07s -> 13971.07s]  End of the game is your, yeah.
[13971.07s -> 13971.87s]  I'll, I can walk around.
[13971.87s -> 13973.47s]  I'm gonna do this probably on my own time.
[13973.47s -> 13977.70s]  Just explore everything and talk to everybody.
[13977.70s -> 13981.38s]  We can finish the game.
[13981.38s -> 13984.06s]  So what, where's the houses?
[13984.06s -> 13985.66s]  The secrets after the school?
[13985.66s -> 13987.28s]  Yeah.
[13987.28s -> 13988.48s]  Oh, the school is a save point.
[13988.48s -> 13989.88s]  Ah, all right, but I want to, like,
[13989.88s -> 13991.48s]  I want to end the game, though.
[13991.48s -> 14000.34s]  Do school first.
[14000.34s -> 14005.79s]  Door is locked.
[14005.79s -> 14011.27s]  What the fuck?
[14011.27s -> 14013.07s]  No, wait, you made me go in the school.
[14013.07s -> 14015.47s]  You said there was a save point.
[14015.47s -> 14017.58s]  What the fuck?
[14017.58s -> 14023.20s]  So this is your castle town.
[14023.20s -> 14025.40s]  It's not bad.
[14025.40s -> 14029.00s]  Chris, Susie, on behalf of everyone, I oppressed.
[14029.20s -> 14032.55s]  Thank you.
[14032.55s -> 14034.35s]  Oh, the save point in the town, okay.
[14034.35s -> 14037.62s]  I'm going to be your wacky roommate now.
[14037.62s -> 14038.22s]  I thought you guys were putting me
[14038.22s -> 14044.09s]  to, like, the next part of the game.
[14044.09s -> 14045.89s]  Chris, I bet you have a lot of people to talk to,
[14045.89s -> 14048.29s]  but you don't have to do everything at once.
[14048.29s -> 14049.89s]  Save and take a break.
[14049.89s -> 14053.93s]  I know, you're in chat right now.
[14053.93s -> 14058.90s]  Where's the save point, up here?
[14058.90s -> 14060.10s]  You thought about how you can't go back
[14060.10s -> 14061.30s]  to the cyber world anymore.
[14061.30s -> 14064.30s]  You considered this carefully.
[14064.30s -> 14065.50s]  Okay, there we go.
[14065.50s -> 14073.04s]  Now let's complete the game.
[14073.04s -> 14075.06s]  Now let's go home.
[14075.06s -> 14076.46s]  Then I can come back here and walk around
[14076.46s -> 14079.05s]  and talk to everybody.
[14079.05s -> 14083.78s]  So now home is where from here?
[14083.78s -> 14096.65s]  Yeah, it's at the top of the town somewhere, right?
[14096.65s -> 14097.25s]  This is it here.
[14097.25s -> 14098.65s]  All right.
[14098.65s -> 14100.15s]  Chris, you going home?
[14100.15s -> 14101.33s]  Yep.
[14101.33s -> 14102.82s]  All right.
[14102.82s -> 14105.02s]  Then I guess it's goodbye for today.
[14105.02s -> 14106.22s]  See you tomorrow, Chris.
[14106.22s -> 14110.57s]  Chris, how was studying with your...
[14110.57s -> 14116.77s]  Why, Chris, is that your friend?
[14116.77s -> 14119.70s]  I did Spampton already, yeah.
[14119.70s -> 14121.70s]  Why don't you invite her inside?
[14121.70s -> 14123.70s]  Uh, I mean, I...
[14123.70s -> 14126.26s]  Chris, I should probably get going.
[14126.26s -> 14128.50s]  And I was going to bake a pie.
[14128.50s -> 14130.70s]  Did you want anything?
[14130.70s -> 14139.74s]  I guess I can come over for a bit.
[14139.74s -> 14147.01s]  Feel free to come in.
[14147.21s -> 14149.41s]  Oh, excuse me. I'm Chris's mother, Toriel.
[14150.61s -> 14153.04s]  Yes, ma'am, I remember.
[14153.04s -> 14156.58s]  Oh, you do? And you are Suzy, are you not?
[14156.58s -> 14157.58s]  Oh, you...
[14157.58s -> 14160.70s]  You remember my name, too?
[14160.70s -> 14163.86s]  Of course. Miss Alfie is a good friend of mine.
[14163.86s -> 14166.66s]  She often talks about you.
[14166.66s -> 14167.86s]  Glad to hear it.
[14167.86s -> 14171.44s]  What the hell is Alfie saying about me?
[14171.44s -> 14174.14s]  Suzy, why don't you wash your hands over there?
[14174.14s -> 14177.14s]  Then we can make the pie together.
[14177.14s -> 14178.78s]  Make it together?
[14178.78s -> 14181.02s]  But I don't know how to.
[14181.02s -> 14183.25s]  Do not worry, I can teach you.
[14183.25s -> 14186.48s]  Okay.
[14186.48s -> 14188.48s]  Chris, Suzy seems like a nice girl.
[14188.48s -> 14190.28s]  I'm very happy you're friends with her.
[14190.28s -> 14195.98s]  But, Chris, I heard from Alfie about her behavior.
[14195.98s -> 14199.48s]  If by any chance she influences you...
[14199.48s -> 14203.19s]  Leave the chalk alone, alright?
[14203.19s -> 14206.54s]  Hands washed.
[14206.54s -> 14208.54s]  Wonderful. Now we can...
[14208.54s -> 14211.54s]  Oh, Chris, how about you show Suzy how to bake it?
[14212.64s -> 14214.64s]  Chris, you know how to make pie?
[14214.64s -> 14217.88s]  The hell have you made me any for? What dumbass?
[14217.88s -> 14221.08s]  You pie hoarding piece of...
[14221.28s -> 14223.28s]  I mean, excuse me, ma'am.
[14223.28s -> 14226.58s]  Suzy, you can just call me Toriel outside of school.
[14226.58s -> 14229.96s]  Oh, okay, sweet.
[14229.96s -> 14232.96s]  Uh, Chris, oh, you need to wash your hands too.
[14232.96s -> 14235.33s]  And I suppose I shall teach Suzy for now.
[14235.33s -> 14237.33s]  Suzy and I will start getting ready to make the pie.
[14239.08s -> 14240.08s]  Wait, what?
[14240.08s -> 14245.16s]  It's a TV.
[14245.16s -> 14250.05s]  They're making a pie.
[14250.05s -> 14252.05s]  Hmm, hmm, hmm.
[14252.05s -> 14254.05s]  She's sneaking sugar right out of the bag.
[14255.35s -> 14256.35s]  Suzy?
[14256.35s -> 14257.66s]  What?
[14257.66s -> 14259.83s]  My pie, my rules.
[14259.83s -> 14262.74s]  Got it.
[14262.74s -> 14263.74s]  I couldn't do that.
[14263.94s -> 14268.95s]  Is the bathroom sink?
[14268.95s -> 14269.95s]  Will you run the tap?
[14269.95s -> 14270.95s]  Yes.
[14270.95s -> 14273.54s]  It started to run.
[14273.54s -> 14275.54s]  It's making a lot of noise.
[14275.54s -> 14285.33s]  Oh, not this again.
[14295.68s -> 14299.01s]  Why does it keep doing this?
[14299.01s -> 14322.56s]  I mean, dude, there are way better ways to hide
[14322.56s -> 14324.56s]  you shitting in the bathroom, by the way.
[14324.56s -> 14338.38s]  Well, let us get the flour.
[14338.38s -> 14340.38s]  That's this, this bag.
[14340.38s -> 14342.38s]  And you just... oops.
[14342.38s -> 14346.01s]  Oh, Suzy, you have flour on your nose.
[14346.01s -> 14348.01s]  Oh, I meant to do that.
[14348.21s -> 14352.09s]  I thought you would stop to smell the flour, eh?
[14356.09s -> 14357.39s]  Come on.
[14357.39s -> 14362.06s]  Now, on to the next part.
[14362.06s -> 14365.06s]  Where the... where the heck is Chris?
[14365.06s -> 14368.75s]  Oh, Chris does this sometimes.
[14368.75s -> 14370.38s]  Well, they should hurry.
[14370.38s -> 14371.38s]  I'm getting sleepy.
[14371.38s -> 14375.32s]  You know what they call a sleeping Suzy?
[14375.32s -> 14377.75s]  Uh, what?
[14377.75s -> 14381.62s]  They would call her a snoozy.
[14381.62s -> 14382.62s]  Uh, haha.
[14382.82s -> 14387.06s]  Then... and I guess you'd be, uh, Snoriel.
[14387.06s -> 14389.74s]  Hahaha, Snoriel!
[14389.74s -> 14391.74s]  Snoozy and Snoriel!
[14391.74s -> 14395.74s]  Uh, yeah, you really liked that one, huh?
[14395.74s -> 14401.50s]  Wasn't it funny?
[14401.50s -> 14404.90s]  Alright, where the hell is Chris?
[14404.90s -> 14405.90s]  Pie is nearly done.
[14405.90s -> 14407.20s]  Oh, the sugar.
[14407.20s -> 14408.20s]  Wait, here a moment.
[14408.20s -> 14409.20s]  I left it in the car.
[14409.20s -> 14410.20s]  Okay.
[14410.20s -> 14434.03s]  What?
[14434.03s -> 14440.88s]  Does it get the heart?
[14440.88s -> 14444.78s]  Okay, this is some, like, this is some weird shit.
[14444.78s -> 14446.78s]  He's taking the heart out and he's, like, killing people
[14446.78s -> 14447.78s]  in town or something.
[14447.98s -> 14450.22s]  He takes the heart out and he just does some weird shit
[14450.22s -> 14451.22s]  outside.
[14451.22s -> 14452.22s]  What is he doing?
[14452.22s -> 14453.22s]  Why does he keep doing that?
[14453.22s -> 14473.06s]  Hey, Chris, hurry up next time.
[14473.06s -> 14489.75s]  We're already almost done.
[14489.75s -> 14490.75s]  What's next?
[14490.75s -> 14492.70s]  Is they?
[14492.70s -> 14494.70s]  Oh, they go by they them.
[14494.70s -> 14499.71s]  Okay.
[14499.71s -> 14501.71s]  We already worked quite hard, have we not?
[14501.71s -> 14503.71s]  How about we finish it later?
[14503.71s -> 14510.05s]  How about we finish it?
[14510.05s -> 14513.12s]  Uh, okay.
[14513.12s -> 14517.09s]  Then I guess I'll walk home.
[14517.09s -> 14519.09s]  Oh, no, there's no need to do that.
[14519.09s -> 14521.97s]  Oh, actually.
[14522.17s -> 14524.66s]  Susie, would you like to stay over?
[14524.66s -> 14525.66s]  Huh?
[14525.66s -> 14529.48s]  I mean, um, if it's okay, then
[14529.48s -> 14531.48s]  here come the chimpanzees.
[14531.48s -> 14539.16s]  Here comes the chimpanzee.
[14539.16s -> 14541.16s]  Everyone's, why, what's going on?
[14541.16s -> 14549.39s]  I have to, every, every character that I control
[14549.39s -> 14551.76s]  is always just becomes, like, me
[14551.76s -> 14552.76s]  in a way.
[14552.76s -> 14554.76s]  As I'm walking around.
[14554.76s -> 14556.76s]  I tend to just say he
[14556.76s -> 14558.76s]  because I put it as me, essentially.
[14558.76s -> 14560.76s]  That's kind of how it works for me.
[14560.76s -> 14564.09s]  Yeah, that's fine, that's cool.
[14564.29s -> 14567.94s]  It always kind of becomes like an extension of me.
[14567.94s -> 14569.94s]  Like, walking around in a circle.
[14569.94s -> 14571.43s]  If that makes any sense.
[14571.43s -> 14578.58s]  Oh, hey, look at this!
[14578.58s -> 14580.58s]  Our couch is used to being used as a bed.
[14580.58s -> 14585.38s]  It's not perfect, but we could all sleep out here.
[14585.38s -> 14588.46s]  We could all sleep out here?
[14588.46s -> 14590.46s]  That sounds too, oh, get the sleeping bag!
[14590.46s -> 14593.08s]  Splendid, I'll make sure everything's in order.
[14593.08s -> 14598.07s]  So why do I keep ripping my heart out
[14598.07s -> 14600.07s]  and attacking people or something?
[14600.07s -> 14603.02s]  Just call your parents, will you not?
[14603.02s -> 14612.68s]  Yeah, of course.
[14612.68s -> 14614.68s]  So, what the hell, what the hell, a sleepover?
[14614.68s -> 14616.92s]  I haven't had one of those in forever.
[14617.12s -> 14621.60s]  We're gonna watch every single episode of Rugrats.
[14621.60s -> 14623.60s]  All of them.
[14623.60s -> 14626.22s]  It's not like someone has to tell you to sit, right?
[14626.22s -> 14629.55s]  Here, chill out for a sec.
[14629.55s -> 14633.65s]  So now what?
[14633.65s -> 14637.79s]  I got it.
[14637.79s -> 14639.79s]  Maybe between the pillows here.
[14639.79s -> 14645.23s]  Here, I knew I'd find the boat in there.
[14645.23s -> 14647.23s]  You can always find good stuff wedged in the couch.
[14647.23s -> 14651.20s]  Geez, it's dusty.
[14651.20s -> 14653.50s]  When did you last use this thing?
[14653.50s -> 14655.50s]  Well, who cares, it's just watch TV.
[14655.50s -> 14658.70s]  So, what are we gonna marathon tonight?
[14658.70s -> 14661.01s]  Blood Crushers 3, Hellbusters,
[14661.21s -> 14663.21s]  Invasion of the Catpetters.
[14663.21s -> 14668.30s]  Maybe Icee, the movie's more your speed, huh, Chris?
[14668.30s -> 14670.54s]  Ha ha ha ha!
[14670.54s -> 14674.19s]  What a good day, huh, Chris?
[14674.19s -> 14676.50s]  You, Rousey, Lancer, everyone.
[14676.50s -> 14679.25s]  It's cool hanging out together.
[14679.25s -> 14683.22s]  That's why, you know, don't you think we should
[14683.22s -> 14685.22s]  try to have them come to our world?
[14685.22s -> 14687.22s]  Come on, think about how much better it would be.
[14687.22s -> 14690.10s]  Lancer could do our homework,
[14690.10s -> 14692.10s]  Lancer could live under your bed.
[14692.10s -> 14694.46s]  We could all walk to school together.
[14694.46s -> 14696.46s]  Perfect, you know?
[14696.46s -> 14698.83s]  Maybe we'd be unstoppable, is what I'm saying.
[14699.03s -> 14704.22s]  Um, I don't know.
[14704.22s -> 14707.48s]  That seems, doesn't that seem,
[14707.48s -> 14711.58s]  isn't it like a different world?
[14711.58s -> 14713.58s]  I feel like that's like a, it'd be hard to do that.
[14713.58s -> 14723.93s]  We could try.
[14723.93s -> 14725.93s]  That seems, I don't know, that seems a little far-fetched.
[14725.93s -> 14727.93s]  What? Come on, it'd be easy.
[14727.93s -> 14729.93s]  Rousey looks like your mom, right?
[14729.93s -> 14731.93s]  Just say he's a long-lost cousin, it'd be easy.
[14731.93s -> 14735.17s]  Lancer could even make him a fake mustache.
[14735.17s -> 14737.41s]  Oh, whatever, let's just get back to watching.
[14737.41s -> 14745.47s]  Well, the festival's coming up, right?
[14745.47s -> 14747.47s]  The thing where the town becomes a carnival?
[14747.67s -> 14749.67s]  Stupid, right?
[14749.67s -> 14754.79s]  Say you had to take someone.
[14754.79s -> 14756.79s]  Noelle or Rousey.
[14756.79s -> 14758.79s]  I would probably take,
[14758.79s -> 14763.91s]  I honestly would probably go with Rousey.
[14763.91s -> 14765.91s]  Like you and Noelle could,
[14765.91s -> 14769.05s]  you could do that, right?
[14769.05s -> 14771.05s]  I'll take Rousey.
[14771.05s -> 14773.05s]  Why are you saying it's so confused?
[14773.05s -> 14775.42s]  It's not like I meant anything weird.
[14775.42s -> 14777.42s]  You know what? Forget it.
[14777.42s -> 14779.42s]  Well, no, I'm just saying like you and Noelle
[14779.42s -> 14781.42s]  can go, will go, like,
[14781.42s -> 14783.42s]  you and Noelle,
[14783.62s -> 14785.62s]  can go, will go, like,
[14785.62s -> 14789.78s]  we'll just go, why can't we just go together?
[14789.78s -> 14792.66s]  Now this is what I'm talking about.
[14792.66s -> 14795.02s]  Giant monster movie special.
[14795.02s -> 14797.02s]  I always like the better than the giant human movies.
[14797.02s -> 14799.02s]  Now this is something we can marathon.
[14799.02s -> 14801.46s]  Are you ready, Chris?
[14801.46s -> 14803.46s]  12 hours of building-bashing, car-crunching action
[14803.46s -> 14805.46s]  because we are locked in, got it?
[14805.46s -> 14807.46s]  Better not see you move until your eyes bloodshot.
[14810.02s -> 14812.02s]  Now let me just get comfortable here.
[14812.02s -> 14824.61s]  Zuzi fell asleep.
[14824.61s -> 14827.10s]  Already? That tends to happen though, it really does.
[14827.30s -> 14833.19s]  What is going on? Why does this keep happening?
[14833.19s -> 14837.74s]  Oh, I thought
[14837.74s -> 14839.74s]  the heart was going to come out again.
[14839.74s -> 14843.24s]  Officer, officer.
[14843.24s -> 14850.41s]  Thank goodness, I finally got through.
[14850.41s -> 14852.41s]  I thought I saw someone
[14852.41s -> 14854.41s]  prowling around outside.
[14854.41s -> 14856.41s]  And when I checked our car,
[14856.41s -> 14858.41s]  the tires looked like they'd been slashed.
[14858.41s -> 14860.65s]  Officer, if you could please come over.
[14860.65s -> 14870.82s]  You will soon, thank you.
[14870.82s -> 14885.72s]  They're already asleep.
[14885.72s -> 14890.97s]  It's not going to happen again, right?
[14890.97s -> 14905.61s]  Maybe it will? Oh god.
[14905.81s -> 14941.06s]  It is again. Oh god.
[14941.06s -> 14945.02s]  Oh, you're making the fountains.
[14945.02s -> 14956.16s]  You're making the fountains.
[14956.16s -> 14962.61s]  You're making fountains.
[14962.61s -> 14968.30s]  Why? Chris is the knight.
[14968.30s -> 14973.28s]  Are we going to get the
[14973.28s -> 14975.28s]  hahahaha
[14975.28s -> 14981.79s]  Come on, do it.
[14981.79s -> 14990.42s]  Well, shit.
[14990.42s -> 14994.00s]  What's going on? This feels weird.
[14994.00s -> 14997.97s]  Oh, I thought it was crashing.
[14997.97s -> 15006.67s]  I thought it was a skipping CD.
[15006.67s -> 15016.46s]  Alright, that was cool. That was good.
[15016.46s -> 15023.38s]  You want me to give it a rating?
[15029.02s -> 15031.02s]  Give it a rating. Alright, I'm going to give that one A.
[15032.02s -> 15034.02s]  I refuse to rate it until the whole thing's up.
[15034.02s -> 15042.32s]  There you go. Number three.
[15042.32s -> 15045.39s]  That was very good though. That was really fun.
[15045.39s -> 15047.39s]  That was exactly what I thought
[15047.39s -> 15050.98s]  it was going to be. Exactly what I expected.
[15050.98s -> 15052.98s]  The weird part about this is I'm surprised.
[15052.98s -> 15054.98s]  This is going to be seven chapters.
[15054.98s -> 15060.10s]  That seems like a lot.
[15060.10s -> 15062.10s]  That seems like a lot more
[15062.10s -> 15064.98s]  to do. Seven.
[15064.98s -> 15070.35s]  See, when you're 50.
[15070.35s -> 15077.39s]  Toby said three to five
[15077.39s -> 15079.39s]  chapters coming out around the same time.
[15079.39s -> 15082.66s]  You know, that would make sense.
[15082.66s -> 15084.96s]  There's another route for
[15084.96s -> 15086.96s]  three, four, five in the same release.
[15086.96s -> 15088.96s]  This is no longer free anymore, right?
[15088.96s -> 15090.96s]  Chapters three, four, and five are a paid thing.
[15090.96s -> 15092.96s]  So they're going to be one
[15092.96s -> 15097.76s]  thing that's paid, right?
[15097.76s -> 15100.38s]  Look, being able to actually
[15100.38s -> 15102.38s]  just check it out, because this is called the demo.
[15102.38s -> 15104.38s]  You get the first two chapters for free and then if you want to
[15104.38s -> 15106.38s]  pay for it and you like it, you can just keep going.
[15106.38s -> 15113.26s]  That's cool.
[15113.26s -> 15115.57s]  That's really cool.
[15115.57s -> 15118.70s]  It's been four, eight.
[15118.70s -> 15120.70s]  The first time I played through was like
[15120.70s -> 15122.70s]  six or seven maybe. It's like almost
[15122.70s -> 15124.70s]  15 to 18 hours of content I've
[15124.70s -> 15127.07s]  gotten for free.
[15127.07s -> 15131.36s]  I absolutely would pay for the next ones, for sure.
[15131.36s -> 15139.74s]  There's a lot more to see. Alright, I am going to
[15139.74s -> 15141.74s]  send you guys, because we're
[15141.74s -> 15143.74s]  pressed for time. There's not going to be an outro
[15143.74s -> 15145.74s]  to this stream. What's going to happen here is
[15145.74s -> 15147.74s]  I'm going to send you guys over to the tip of the hat stream
[15147.74s -> 15150.62s]  right now, and I will
[15150.62s -> 15152.62s]  see you if you go over there and you want to hang out.
[15152.62s -> 15154.62s]  I don't know how much longer.
[15154.62s -> 15158.27s]  I think they're going to be live for a little bit longer.
[15158.27s -> 15160.27s]  I'm going to go from there. I'm going to take a quick
[15160.27s -> 15162.27s]  little break. We're going to raid the tip of the hats.
[15162.27s -> 15164.58s]  I'm going to go to the
[15164.58s -> 15166.58s]  bathroom. I'm going to go to the water.
[15166.58s -> 15168.58s]  I will be appearing on that stream very
[15168.58s -> 15171.33s]  shortly. I will see you guys next weekend.
[15171.33s -> 15173.33s]  We'll go on Saturday of
[15173.33s -> 15175.33s]  this next week exactly. I'll see you Saturday, Sunday,
[15175.33s -> 15177.50s]  next weekend. Weekend, day, and day at it again.
[15177.50s -> 15183.06s]  I'll see you guys soon.
[15183.06s -> 15185.06s]  Go hang out at the tip of the hats if you want to see.
[15185.06s -> 15187.66s]  I think we're going to play, what's this called?
[15187.66s -> 15189.84s]  Gartic Phone?
[15189.84s -> 15192.85s]  I'm going to play Gartic Phone.
[15192.85s -> 15196.94s]  So I don't know how much longer that stream's
[15196.94s -> 15198.94s]  going to go for, but maybe at least enough
[15198.94s -> 15200.94s]  for it to hang out for an hour or so. I'm not sure.
[15200.94s -> 15207.84s]  Alright, let's raid.
[15207.84s -> 15209.84s]  I will see you guys later. See you next weekend. Thank you.
[15209.84s -> 15211.84s]  Delta Room was really good. It was awesome.
[15211.84s -> 15213.84s]  It was a great experience. Happy to have had it with you.
[15213.84s -> 15217.09s]  See you next weekend. Goodbye.
[15217.09s -> 15220.16s]  Good night. Take care of yourselves.
[15220.16s -> 15270.27s]  See you soon.
[15275.42s -> 15278.69s]  There's so many fucking boogers in my nose.
[15278.69s -> 15281.12s]  Oh my god, hot bike!
[15281.12s -> 15283.12s]  See you guys later.
