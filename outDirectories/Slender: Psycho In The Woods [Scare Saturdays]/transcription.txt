[0.31s -> 10.43s]  Hey, what is going on everybody?
[10.43s -> 13.43s]  Jerma here with some Slender.
[13.43s -> 17.86s]  By popular demand, a lot of people wanted me to play this.
[17.86s -> 19.86s]  I got a lot of comments telling me to do this.
[19.86s -> 27.16s]  And I looked up some stuff on it, and my god, I'm not ready to play this game.
[27.16s -> 30.34s]  But you know what? It's Scarce Saturdays, so we gotta go.
[30.34s -> 35.53s]  The whole point of this game is you're supposed to collect eight pages
[35.53s -> 44.38s]  and avoid this thing that's in the woods, the Slenderman.
[44.38s -> 54.04s]  Here we go. This is just a giant wall in the middle of nowhere.
[54.04s -> 57.85s]  Oh my god, a page. Okay, there's one.
[57.85s -> 68.83s]  How do I pick it up? Okay.
[68.83s -> 70.83s]  How do I zoom back out? How do I zoom out?
[70.83s -> 77.78s]  Okay, Q. What is that noise? What's going on here?
[77.78s -> 88.15s]  I'm just gonna run. I don't even want to know. I'm not gonna turn around.
[88.15s -> 95.53s]  Oh, where is this guy? I don't want to go in the same direction that he is.
[95.53s -> 105.06s]  Oh my god. He's right behind me. He's back behind me.
[105.06s -> 112.77s]  Oh my god, please tell me there's like a place I can go over here.
[112.77s -> 120.73s]  Get me out of here. If I'm holding down shift and I can't run that fast.
[120.73s -> 128.69s]  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
[128.69s -> 135.34s]  Team! Go, go, run, run, you mother.
[135.34s -> 139.87s]  He is right behind me. Just go.
[139.87s -> 143.47s]  I found a little archway. A little archway. That's what I want. That's what I want.
[143.47s -> 150.15s]  I don't see him. Don't see him. Don't see him. Don't see him.
[150.15s -> 155.10s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Go, go, go, go.
[155.10s -> 164.73s]  Let's grab this note. The drumbeats are gonna drive me crazy.
[164.73s -> 181.84s]  Can't run? What the hell does that mean? Can't run. Can't run. Great.
[181.84s -> 188.23s]  What is it, like a bathroom in the middle of nowhere? What the hell is this?
[188.23s -> 193.99s]  Alright, I gotta take like a dump. Hold on, I gotta go in like the bathroom.
[193.99s -> 199.72s]  This is a bad idea, man. This is a terrible idea. There better be a note in here.
[199.72s -> 204.49s]  Oh man. Oh my god. Oh my god.
[204.49s -> 208.90s]  What's with this bathroom? This is the weirdest bathroom I've ever seen in my life.
[208.90s -> 214.02s]  What is going on up there? Oh, there's one. There's a note.
[214.02s -> 219.53s]  Help me.
[219.53s -> 228.83s]  Wonderful. Absolutely wonderful.
[228.83s -> 232.94s]  Where else have I not been? I'm lost in the forest.
[232.94s -> 242.13s]  With a madman.
[242.13s -> 250.11s]  Oh my. That was him. That was him. He's right behind me.
[250.11s -> 254.91s]  You have to run faster, you son of a bitch. Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[254.91s -> 260.13s]  What's going on? Sticky keys? No, screw you. Oh my god, he must be right behind me now.
[260.13s -> 266.73s]  Dude, like Windows just had like an error because I hit shift way too many times.
[266.73s -> 276.46s]  That's a tree. Oh my god. Oh my god, oh my god.
[276.46s -> 283.10s]  Just don't look at him. Just don't look at him. Just go this way. Go this way. Go this way. Go this way. Go this way.
[283.10s -> 287.73s]  Oh, man. Oh, you...
[287.73s -> 290.10s]  Where's the other notes?
[290.10s -> 293.70s]  Alright, this is different. This is different. This could be a note.
[293.70s -> 301.10s]  Could be a note here on one of these big trees.
[301.10s -> 310.35s]  Come on, give me a note. Give me a note. Give me something.
[314.26s -> 322.19s]  I have no more run. I have no more run. I have no more run. I have no more run.
[322.19s -> 327.86s]  This guy is just a relentless prick.
[327.86s -> 331.86s]  Dude, playing Ring Around the Rosie with this guy right now is not a good idea.
[340.85s -> 350.32s]  I just walked into a wall. I just walked into a wall.
[350.32s -> 357.56s]  Well, I'll see you guys all next time. And the link is in the description if you want to play that game.
[357.56s -> 359.56s]  Slender.
[359.56s -> 364.70s]  I'll see y'all soon. Take care, everybody.
