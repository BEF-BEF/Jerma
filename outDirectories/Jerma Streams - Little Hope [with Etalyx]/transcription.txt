[0.57s -> 9.82s]  Oh, fuck, my mic's on. Hey, hey guys, how are you? How's everybody doing? You're not supposed to hear me like...
[11.26s -> 15.03s]  Alright, so yeah, everybody, this is- I'm just here.
[16.07s -> 22.07s]  So the- there's an M&M's commercial now for Halloween, and the implications in the M&M commercial
[22.67s -> 30.92s]  are that the M&M's are fucking dead. The yellow M&M and the red M&M are walking around a house.
[30.92s -> 36.48s]  It's like a scary house and the red M&M's like, hey, yellow, we almost got eaten this year.
[36.48s -> 42.28s]  Good thing that was a close one. And yellow is a ghost walking through walls with a big bite out of his head.
[42.44s -> 50.66s]  He's like, yeah, I think so too. Yeah, we really got out of that one. And this motherfucker's dead. Like they killed the yellow M&M.
[50.66s -> 52.97s]  He's dead. Hey, Fred.
[53.45s -> 61.03s]  He's dead. I'm serious. Can we watch it on stream? I don't think we can watch it on stream.
[62.53s -> 64.53s]  This is like a commercial that came out like today.
[65.17s -> 70.74s]  They're writing off the yellow M&M? No, I don't know. I'm just telling you, he's dead in the commercial.
[71.50s -> 76.24s]  Run ads until we see it.
[78.58s -> 84.90s]  Alright, we'll see it eventually. Just a couple more Samsung phone commercials. We got seven of them in a row.
[85.62s -> 94.80s]  Run ads until we see it. I'm telling you guys, you'll see it on TV. The yellow M&M is dead. He's dead.
[95.46s -> 97.46s]  He's a ghost with a big bite out of his head.
[99.66s -> 107.49s]  Here it is right here. Is it? He better not be bullshit. This is it? This is it. Alright, here we go. Let's watch this.
[107.49s -> 110.61s]  Can I do this? Is this allowed? Can I watch like an ad on TV?
[111.13s -> 120.04s]  Wait, it can't be. Is something wrong with this? Well, we're just gonna watch the part where it shows that he's dead.
[121.04s -> 126.54s]  I'm not gonna put it in the- hold on.
[126.54s -> 142.45s]  Here's- just wait a second. I want to show this to you. Oh, look at that. Oh, no. That's my stream key.
[142.45s -> 146.44s]  That's my stream key. Oh, that's my stream key. Alright, watch.
[154.29s -> 156.77s]  He's dead. He was- he was killed.
[161.58s -> 165.42s]  They killed the yellow M&M. He's fucking dead.
[166.10s -> 177.23s]  Anyways, we're gonna play- that was an ad. It was, but I was- I was- I was making my comments on that ad.
[177.27s -> 190.90s]  So I was commenting on it. Yeah, see? No, I was transforming that content.
[191.02s -> 194.86s]  See, what happened was the ad played and I went, see?
[196.42s -> 204.54s]  And I transformed it and it actually turned into mine. It was transformed.
[205.80s -> 207.64s]  React, Mr. Reaver.
[207.64s -> 210.72s]  Anyways, hi guys. Let's go back to the intro because we're not- we're not here yet.
[211.04s -> 214.43s]  We are, but kind of not. Here, back to the intro.
[214.87s -> 221.03s]  You're shilling M&M's. Guys, see, M&M's have been around for like 150 years. I don't think they need any more advertising help.
[221.03s -> 228.44s]  Like, I- I- I- I wouldn't- M&M's, I wouldn't be surprised if they showed up in the national anthem, okay?
[228.44s -> 233.04s]  It's been like 150 years. That would do- everyone knows what a fucking M&M is.
[233.52s -> 243.06s]  Poor Liz for corporate takeover.
[243.42s -> 247.70s]  Now, we're gonna play, uh, Man of Badan. It's not Man of Badan. I keep calling it Man of Badan.
[248.02s -> 250.20s]  It's the Dark Pictures anthology.
[252.78s -> 256.46s]  Little Hope. It's the second in that series that they're doing.
[258.08s -> 262.52s]  And we're gonna play with italics. We played this with italics last time, so might as well play them until
[263.00s -> 265.00s]  they're gonna do eight of these.
[265.04s -> 269.96s]  See you in a year when the third one comes out and then they cancel the rest of them.
[270.40s -> 274.03s]  I don't think they're gonna do this for like seven or eight straight years from now.
[274.03s -> 283.02s]  I think it's- saying eight, I think might have been a little- a little much to say.
[283.46s -> 287.38s]  That's almost ten years apparently, because the last one came out a year ago.
[288.02s -> 294.12s]  So, if they're on pace for ten years of content, maybe this is just what they're gonna do. Maybe Supermassive,
[294.12s -> 296.44s]  they're just like, you know what, fuck it. Let's just do this scary
[296.96s -> 301.96s]  movie kind of choose-your-own-adventure games, and that's just what we're gonna do for the next ten years. Maybe?
[302.48s -> 307.94s]  I'll give them some credit where it's due. I mean, it's kind of interesting to be able to share a story like this.
[307.94s -> 309.94s]  The first one was okay.
[310.30s -> 311.94s]  It was okay.
[311.94s -> 316.41s]  We had our fun with it. This is the second one. We're gonna give it a chance.
[317.17s -> 325.36s]  So, I don't know, we have no idea how this works. We're just gonna do new story. We'll just, uh,
[326.08s -> 334.70s]  Alex should be joining us in any minute here. You got scammed twice.
[335.42s -> 343.89s]  Um, well, no, I enjoyed the last one. I mean, it was- it was a little dopey, but it was still fun.
[344.29s -> 355.66s]  Turn your facecam on? You might get a facecam for some of this stream. How's that sound? Driver install waiting room.
[355.66s -> 361.22s]  I- I have the brand new driver from yesterday. There ain't any other drivers I can install.
[361.74s -> 368.03s]  This one's good?
[368.03s -> 376.82s]  All right, I'll take your word for it. I think we're- I think we're ready to go. Are we?
[376.82s -> 378.34s]  Are we good to go? I'm good to go.
[378.34s -> 379.74s]  Are you good to go?
[379.74s -> 382.30s]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's, uh-
[382.30s -> 382.80s]  I am ready.
[382.80s -> 385.26s]  That's italics. Those of you that don't know.
[385.26s -> 387.58s]  Oh, everybody knows.
[387.58s -> 390.53s]  Everybody wants to see this happen.
[390.53s -> 395.25s]  You think that they- these people in the stream haven't heard of me?
[396.29s -> 399.05s]  Excuse me?
[399.05s -> 401.05s]  We got an ego stroker here. Okay.
[401.57s -> 404.40s]  Okay, I've got a, uh,
[404.40s -> 407.88s]  bot trawling for anyone that who omega lols.
[408.00s -> 413.49s]  You're getting- you're getting hoed like crazy right now. You don't who italics.
[413.49s -> 417.27s]  He's been around for like- we've like known each other for like ten fucking years.
[417.91s -> 423.43s]  Listen, they're just revealing who is a fucking fake fan right now in your stream.
[423.43s -> 423.93s]  That's true.
[423.93s -> 427.99s]  These are people who omega lol who have only just gotten to your stream in the last
[429.11s -> 431.11s]  365 days.
[431.11s -> 432.03s]  Oh shit.
[432.23s -> 436.19s]  He's calling a lot of you guys out, and I have nothing I can do about it.
[436.19s -> 439.97s]  I mean, I could just boot him. You ready?
[440.25s -> 442.40s]  Let's go.
[442.40s -> 444.40s]  Fake fans.
[444.40s -> 450.54s]  You already get- he is kind of toxic though. I feel like- I've said- I've asked him like questions before and he's like,
[450.54s -> 455.55s]  What are you dumb? I'm like, dude, I'm not dumb. What are you toxic? And then he ghosts me for two days.
[455.55s -> 459.26s]  It's like fucking come on, dude.
[459.26s -> 460.58s]  He's right.
[460.58s -> 462.58s]  Oh, do you want to be Anthony or Tanya?
[462.58s -> 466.68s]  Whoever is left over.
[466.68s -> 468.68s]  Okay, so who do I want to be?
[468.68s -> 470.68s]  Do I want to be Anthony?
[470.68s -> 472.68s]  You're the like, player one right now.
[472.68s -> 475.68s]  Yeah, I am player one.
[475.68s -> 477.68s]  Anthony, Anthony, Anthony, Anthony, Anthony, Anthony.
[477.68s -> 479.68s]  All right, all right, all right. What is it?
[479.68s -> 481.68s]  Oh, because Anthony, Anthony. Okay, I guess that makes sense.
[481.68s -> 485.14s]  All right, you're gonna be Tanya, I guess.
[485.14s -> 489.99s]  Okay.
[489.99s -> 495.36s]  Does it say you're ready?
[495.36s -> 497.36s]  Hold on, you can't get ready up on a controller, you have to push the enter button.
[497.36s -> 499.36s]  Oh, he's on a controller?
[499.36s -> 501.36s]  He's not even a PC gamer?
[501.36s -> 512.32s]  Listen, I gotta get the last life out of this Xbox One Series X Elite Bundle version before it gets replaced in like-
[512.32s -> 514.32s]  Did you put subtitles on?
[514.32s -> 516.32s]  To play with a controller, press A.
[516.32s -> 522.97s]  To play with point and click controls using a mouse, press this one.
[522.97s -> 524.97s]  That was me.
[524.97s -> 526.97s]  Was I supposed to select something? Because I just left clicked and then it started loading.
[526.97s -> 528.97s]  Oh, you left clicked? I think you just- you selected keyboard and mouse.
[528.97s -> 533.18s]  Did I really?
[533.18s -> 543.04s]  Yep. All right, shh. Don't talk during the cutscene.
[543.04s -> 545.04s]  Unless there's some wicked fun to you, I have to say.
[545.04s -> 548.21s]  If you do, just talk over the fucking game.
[548.21s -> 557.17s]  Oh, shit.
[557.17s -> 559.17s]  Already paused.
[559.17s -> 561.17s]  I was turning off the volume.
[561.17s -> 565.33s]  I was gonna turn off the volume of the game.
[565.33s -> 567.33s]  All right, dude, just go, go, go, go, go, go.
[567.33s -> 570.79s]  Hit the- hit the button.
[570.79s -> 574.31s]  Ooey gooey.
[574.31s -> 576.80s]  I'm sorry. All right, stop.
[576.80s -> 587.88s]  Was it a book called The Wild Dick?
[589.69s -> 593.40s]  The romance section.
[593.40s -> 595.84s]  The Wild Dick.
[595.84s -> 610.30s]  This game's fucking boring.
[610.30s -> 612.30s]  I think I'm- I don't wanna do this anymore.
[612.30s -> 614.30s]  Like, oh, he drove a bus. It's just fucking fun.
[614.30s -> 627.61s]  I was just gonna say something I can't-
[627.61s -> 629.61s]  I'm not gonna say it.
[629.61s -> 631.61s]  I'm gonna say it because this bus is-
[631.61s -> 633.61s]  Oh, everyone's gonna leave if I say it.
[633.61s -> 635.61s]  But, like, who cares? I'm just gonna do it.
[635.61s -> 637.61s]  It's so loud, but I can't alt-tab without pausing the game.
[637.61s -> 642.28s]  Dude, this bus is-
[642.28s -> 644.28s]  This bus is- I can't even fucking-
[644.28s -> 646.28s]  You know what I was gonna say. Who cares?
[647.28s -> 654.13s]  What?
[654.13s -> 656.13s]  Oh, I was gonna say, yo, this bus is kinda sus.
[661.59s -> 665.43s]  I told you you were all gonna fucking leave if I did that.
[676.52s -> 678.52s]  Where's the subtitles?
[678.52s -> 681.27s]  I put them on.
[690.19s -> 692.19s]  Oh, I thought Little Hope was, like, the name of, like, a little kid or something.
[693.19s -> 695.19s]  Like, Little Hope is, like, the scary girl.
[710.34s -> 712.34s]  Turn on the- I will.
[712.34s -> 715.35s]  Oh, hey, dude, did you know that the yellow M&M's dead?
[719.00s -> 726.36s]  Damn. Alright.
[744.76s -> 746.76s]  Is he imagining this, or are the people in the bus doing this?
[752.12s -> 754.12s]  Are you suggesting the people on the bus are psychic?
[754.12s -> 756.12s]  No, I feel like the people talk on a bus.
[773.32s -> 775.32s]  He was supposed to drop them off.
[776.32s -> 796.09s]  No one was talking.
[796.09s -> 798.09s]  Oh, bearing updated. What does that mean?
[798.09s -> 808.59s]  Alright, I gotta turn subtitles on.
[808.59s -> 810.59s]  Listen, between scenes.
[810.59s -> 813.32s]  Subtitles.
[813.32s -> 816.14s]  Subtitles.
[816.14s -> 818.14s]  Okay, did you turn on subtitles yet?
[818.14s -> 820.44s]  Subtitles? Minimal? What?
[820.44s -> 822.68s]  All.
[822.68s -> 824.92s]  I think all is, like,
[824.92s -> 826.92s]  describes sounds and, like-
[826.92s -> 830.88s]  Yeah, but I had them on.
[830.88s -> 832.88s]  I think I have mine on minimal.
[832.88s -> 835.12s]  Were you getting subtitles during that cutscene?
[835.12s -> 838.64s]  I wasn't. What the fuck is this?
[838.64s -> 840.64s]  I'm supposed to be going through my TV. This is bullshit.
[840.64s -> 845.36s]  I'm going to keep it on.
[845.36s -> 848.36s]  Hang on, you have a TV?
[848.36s -> 856.04s]  I don't have a TV because I don't wear two headphones.
[856.04s -> 865.77s]  I'm one headphone Andy.
[865.77s -> 867.77s]  Listen, I don't think there's been a co-op stream in history
[867.77s -> 869.77s]  that hasn't had at least five technical difficulties.
[869.77s -> 872.27s]  Well, this is fine.
[872.27s -> 875.66s]  I'll just turn it up.
[875.66s -> 878.60s]  Are you good?
[878.60s -> 880.78s]  So I turned on all,
[880.78s -> 883.28s]  so therefore, I should see all the subtitles.
[883.28s -> 886.03s]  What is happening?
[886.03s -> 888.78s]  I did not do anything!
[888.78s -> 891.34s]  You did. He's lying.
[891.34s -> 894.54s]  How do you get jumpscared with one headphone?
[894.54s -> 897.36s]  Only on the right side.
[897.36s -> 899.36s]  If there's a jumpscare that happens over here,
[899.36s -> 901.36s]  like if there's a person off-screen that's screaming over here,
[901.36s -> 903.36s]  if it's like,
[903.36s -> 905.36s]  Hey, chat, what-
[905.36s -> 907.79s]  Is the game playing for you?
[907.79s -> 910.67s]  No, it says you keep pausing the game.
[910.67s -> 915.02s]  I'm not.
[915.02s -> 917.02s]  It's just a nice screensaver
[917.02s -> 919.02s]  of this winter home.
[919.02s -> 921.64s]  There's nothing on my screen.
[921.64s -> 923.64s]  It says pause by etal.
[923.64s -> 926.72s]  I have not. I've done no such thing.
[926.72s -> 929.92s]  Do you have a controller? Press start.
[929.92s -> 931.92s]  There's no menu. If I hit escape, the mouse disappears.
[931.92s -> 934.65s]  Okay, what about now?
[934.65s -> 936.65s]  Listen, I don't like throwing out
[936.65s -> 938.65s]  red flags within the first ten minutes,
[938.65s -> 940.65s]  but I think it crashed.
[940.65s -> 946.40s]  It did?
[946.40s -> 948.40s]  Well, alright, we'll just start over and we'll skip the first cutscene.
[948.40s -> 953.58s]  Alright, I'm gonna return to main menu,
[953.58s -> 957.23s]  and then I'm gonna invite you again.
[957.23s -> 961.52s]  Wait, it's Alex, have you updated your graphics drivers?
[961.52s -> 965.36s]  In general, or like literally yesterday?
[965.36s -> 967.36s]  Because there was a new driver yesterday,
[967.36s -> 969.36s]  but I did not update that one.
[969.36s -> 974.09s]  You needed the Watch Dogs Legion driver.
[974.09s -> 976.40s]  Okay, shared story, let's go.
[976.40s -> 982.41s]  I'm creating your session.
[982.41s -> 984.41s]  Okay, I'm inviting you.
[984.41s -> 988.76s]  I just gave you an e-vite.
[988.76s -> 992.99s]  Watch Dogs is cursed.
[992.99s -> 994.99s]  Watch Dogs Legion waiting room.
[994.99s -> 996.99s]  Oh, you're gonna be waiting a real
[996.99s -> 1000.96s]  long fucking time.
[1000.96s -> 1002.96s]  I would rather play The Surge 2
[1002.96s -> 1005.20s]  sitting on a spiked chair.
[1005.20s -> 1007.20s]  Did you say The Surge 2?
[1007.20s -> 1009.20s]  Yes, then open up Watch Dogs Legion again.
[1009.20s -> 1011.56s]  Did you get my invite?
[1011.56s -> 1013.56s]  I haven't even gotten, okay, I just got back to the main menu.
[1013.56s -> 1023.47s]  Sick.
[1023.47s -> 1025.47s]  Why are these transitional buttons so long?
[1025.47s -> 1029.88s]  Saw 2 waiting room.
[1029.88s -> 1031.88s]  Both of those games are never showing up ever again.
[1031.88s -> 1036.11s]  Dude, should I just play Surge 2
[1036.11s -> 1038.11s]  on a spiked fucking chair?
[1038.11s -> 1040.41s]  Would that be like TOS?
[1040.41s -> 1043.10s]  I don't think you would last 30 minutes.
[1043.10s -> 1045.10s]  No, but if it was like a fake spiked chair
[1045.10s -> 1047.10s]  and I'm sitting there going like, oh, oh!
[1047.10s -> 1049.10s]  No, I don't care about the spiked chair,
[1049.10s -> 1051.53s]  I'm talking about The Surge 2.
[1051.53s -> 1053.53s]  You think I could sit on a spiked chair
[1053.53s -> 1055.53s]  longer than I could play The Surge 2?
[1055.53s -> 1057.53s]  I do. In separate circumstances?
[1057.53s -> 1060.60s]  That's so funny.
[1060.60s -> 1063.68s]  Okay, we'll see.
[1063.68s -> 1065.68s]  So you're saying that I would be able to
[1065.68s -> 1068.30s]  be okay getting tortured
[1068.30s -> 1071.55s]  than play The Surge 2?
[1071.55s -> 1073.55s]  Yes.
[1073.55s -> 1075.55s]  What's your other bottom 2 game?
[1075.55s -> 1077.55s]  It's The Surge 2 and
[1077.55s -> 1081.00s]  Evil Within 2.
[1081.00s -> 1083.00s]  I hated that game.
[1083.00s -> 1088.43s]  I didn't think that was as bad as The Surge.
[1088.43s -> 1091.05s]  Yeah, Mario Tennis.
[1091.05s -> 1093.05s]  How can someone hate Mario Tennis?
[1093.05s -> 1095.05s]  I hate that game, it's fucking stupid, I hate it.
[1095.05s -> 1098.06s]  Rockstar's Table Tennis.
[1098.06s -> 1100.06s]  I didn't play it.
[1100.06s -> 1104.22s]  That's toxic?
[1104.22s -> 1106.22s]  You guys know that I don't like Mario Tennis,
[1106.22s -> 1109.80s]  that's not like a secret.
[1109.80s -> 1112.62s]  Continue the story.
[1112.62s -> 1116.12s]  Do you have a button to press?
[1116.12s -> 1118.12s]  I have already pushed it.
[1118.12s -> 1120.12s]  Okay, here we go.
[1120.12s -> 1122.12s]  I think there's just too many people playing this right now
[1122.12s -> 1124.12s]  and their servers are having problems.
[1124.12s -> 1127.18s]  Welcome to any game that's released after 2015.
[1127.18s -> 1129.18s]  Play it 3 weeks later and the game will actually work.
[1129.18s -> 1132.96s]  There's no such thing as a game launch anymore.
[1132.96s -> 1134.96s]  They just like back up a dump truck
[1134.96s -> 1136.96s]  and dump the code out in your front fucking lawn
[1136.96s -> 1139.58s]  and then
[1139.58s -> 1141.58s]  somebody shows up like 3 weeks later
[1141.58s -> 1143.58s]  and cleans up the garbage on your front lawn.
[1143.58s -> 1148.96s]  Well, this is probably good because
[1148.96s -> 1151.13s]  the first time I didn't know I was supposed to
[1151.13s -> 1153.88s]  push the controller button.
[1153.88s -> 1156.19s]  Alright, we're good, this is it, we're ready.
[1156.19s -> 1166.62s]  We're in the house now.
[1166.62s -> 1168.62s]  Stop it, James. You know I hate it when you don't take
[1168.62s -> 1170.62s]  the things I say seriously.
[1170.62s -> 1173.24s]  Come on, sweetheart, I just had a rough day today.
[1173.24s -> 1175.87s]  Can you believe they are at each other again?
[1175.87s -> 1178.24s]  I can.
[1178.24s -> 1181.69s]  You're drunk!
[1181.69s -> 1183.69s]  What a surprise!
[1183.69s -> 1185.69s]  The kids drunk?
[1185.69s -> 1187.69s]  That's not it, never is!
[1187.69s -> 1189.69s]  Drunk again, darling.
[1189.69s -> 1191.69s]  Some of us may be losing our jobs.
[1191.69s -> 1193.69s]  You've been saying that for years!
[1193.69s -> 1195.69s]  I'm more worried about Megan.
[1195.69s -> 1197.69s]  What's wrong with Megan? She looks okay to me.
[1197.69s -> 1199.69s]  Everything looks okay after 10 beers.
[1199.69s -> 1201.87s]  Reverend Carson held her back after
[1201.87s -> 1203.87s]  prayers today.
[1203.87s -> 1205.87s]  That's 4 weeks running.
[1205.87s -> 1207.87s]  Boston?
[1215.87s -> 1217.87s]  Boston.
[1229.87s -> 1231.87s]  It's a weird role for Chevy Chase to be doing.
[1235.87s -> 1237.87s]  The situation is serious, Anne!
[1237.87s -> 1240.36s]  Real serious!
[1240.36s -> 1250.72s]  Alright, here we go.
[1250.72s -> 1252.72s]  Is that one of your photos?
[1252.72s -> 1255.02s]  I don't know.
[1255.02s -> 1257.02s]  Wait, me? Like actually me?
[1257.02s -> 1262.40s]  That could be you as a kid.
[1262.40s -> 1267.77s]  It kind of looked like me when I was little.
[1267.77s -> 1269.77s]  Yeah, it's the Clark family home.
[1269.77s -> 1273.23s]  Sorry, it's the Clark family home.
[1273.23s -> 1276.68s]  Hey.
[1276.68s -> 1278.68s]  Hang on, I'm...
[1280.68s -> 1282.68s]  That was me that just did that.
[1282.68s -> 1284.68s]  Okay, I'm this kid here.
[1296.54s -> 1299.16s]  That's the bandit snatched kid.
[1299.16s -> 1301.16s]  What's his name?
[1303.72s -> 1312.75s]  He's in Meet the Millers.
[1312.75s -> 1315.31s]  Ben Shapiro?
[1315.31s -> 1317.31s]  What? What are you fucking talking about?
[1319.31s -> 1323.53s]  Hey.
[1325.53s -> 1327.53s]  Everything Megan does is an accident.
[1327.53s -> 1333.74s]  What's up?
[1333.74s -> 1335.74s]  Shapiro. Why?
[1335.74s -> 1337.74s]  It wasn't just one person that wrote that.
[1337.74s -> 1342.67s]  Like a hundred of you did.
[1342.67s -> 1344.67s]  Hey, can you come let me in? I'm locked out of the house.
[1344.67s -> 1347.23s]  Oh, this is you.
[1347.23s -> 1349.40s]  I'm going to start climbing through the window
[1349.40s -> 1354.20s]  unless that door gets fixed.
[1354.20s -> 1356.20s]  Your character looks like they're wearing a wig.
[1356.20s -> 1358.38s]  How's things?
[1358.38s -> 1361.45s]  Let me guess.
[1361.45s -> 1363.45s]  He's been pumping iron again?
[1363.45s -> 1365.45s]  They've been at each of his throats since dad got home.
[1365.45s -> 1367.45s]  That's just me from 2006
[1367.45s -> 1369.45s]  but like with blonde hair.
[1369.45s -> 1371.45s]  You're really thinking about whatever you're about to say?
[1382.32s -> 1384.32s]  Daleks.
[1398.56s -> 1402.56s]  This is a valuable, rare, and sought after collection.
[1402.56s -> 1404.56s]  My amiibos.
[1404.56s -> 1406.56s]  I'll just take these to my room.
[1406.56s -> 1408.56s]  They're Pokemon cards, mom.
[1408.56s -> 1410.56s]  Didn't you say Clefairy is worth
[1410.56s -> 1412.56s]  $355,000 now?
[1412.56s -> 1414.56s]  What's crawled up his ass?
[1414.56s -> 1418.84s]  He's being a jerk.
[1418.84s -> 1421.28s]  He's being even more annoying than usual tonight.
[1421.28s -> 1423.28s]  Real jerk.
[1423.28s -> 1426.28s]  Funko Puffs.
[1426.28s -> 1436.70s]  Hey, Dennis.
[1436.70s -> 1439.26s]  Hey. Not now, sis. I'm busy.
[1439.26s -> 1442.01s]  Is that a doll of her?
[1442.01s -> 1448.60s]  That's weird.
[1448.60s -> 1450.60s]  Hey, quit acting crazy.
[1450.60s -> 1452.60s]  Is the ghost doing it?
[1452.60s -> 1458.43s]  Oh, this is the Resident Evil 7
[1458.43s -> 1460.43s]  please, Wolf.
[1460.43s -> 1462.43s]  Why is that scary?
[1462.43s -> 1464.43s]  He walked into the room that the mom was in.
[1464.43s -> 1466.43s]  Why is that scary?
[1466.43s -> 1468.67s]  Not now, Megan.
[1468.67s -> 1470.67s]  I'd like to have a bath in peace.
[1470.67s -> 1472.67s]  Holy shit, a child
[1472.67s -> 1474.67s]  that lives here.
[1474.67s -> 1477.42s]  Holy shit.
[1477.42s -> 1482.67s]  I love the idea that they've apparently lived with her
[1482.67s -> 1484.67s]  for years, but she's just really
[1484.67s -> 1486.67s]  scary tonight.
[1486.67s -> 1491.21s]  Are you going to lock everybody in?
[1491.21s -> 1496.51s]  Maybe you should talk to mom and dad.
[1496.51s -> 1498.51s]  It's not a great idea for me to get involved.
[1498.51s -> 1500.51s]  You know what I'm like? I just upset someone.
[1500.51s -> 1502.51s]  They sounded more serious than the usual
[1502.51s -> 1504.51s]  bullshit.
[1504.51s -> 1506.51s]  I'm talking about Megan.
[1506.51s -> 1509.64s]  She's done something bad.
[1509.64s -> 1511.64s]  I can't say I'm surprised. There's definitely something off with Megan.
[1511.64s -> 1513.64s]  I don't get why everyone keeps picking on her.
[1513.64s -> 1515.64s]  Okay, Mr. Shining Knight in armor.
[1515.64s -> 1517.64s]  Where's the little princess anyway?
[1522.88s -> 1524.88s]  Megan's gone upstairs.
[1524.88s -> 1526.88s]  Maybe you can go check on her if you don't have other plans.
[1526.88s -> 1529.44s]  I'll go find her.
[1529.44s -> 1534.36s]  Ooh, this is the first
[1534.36s -> 1536.36s]  split of the evening.
[1536.36s -> 1538.60s]  Second, actually.
[1538.60s -> 1540.60s]  You had to open the door for me, remember?
[1540.60s -> 1543.42s]  Oh, that's right.
[1543.42s -> 1550.72s]  What do we have here?
[1550.72s -> 1555.84s]  Who cares?
[1555.84s -> 1558.78s]  Wouldn't that explode your house?
[1558.78s -> 1560.78s]  That scares the shit out of me when people do that.
[1560.78s -> 1562.78s]  Is that the gas line underneath to blow up the fucking house?
[1562.78s -> 1568.09s]  I can't see what you can see.
[1568.09s -> 1572.89s]  Oh, we should move then.
[1572.89s -> 1579.36s]  We're in time with the heartbeat?
[1579.36s -> 1583.00s]  I'm sneaking by dad.
[1583.00s -> 1586.97s]  Don't wake daddy.
[1586.97s -> 1598.54s]  Fuck your brothers.
[1598.54s -> 1600.54s]  It was right click, right?
[1600.54s -> 1602.54s]  It was the easiest thing ever.
[1602.54s -> 1609.58s]  It was right click.
[1609.58s -> 1611.58s]  I'm not a moron. I'm not a fish.
[1611.58s -> 1613.58s]  I'm a person. I'm a human. I'm a human man.
[1613.58s -> 1616.59s]  Check on Tanya.
[1616.59s -> 1618.59s]  Press to move to a location.
[1618.59s -> 1626.20s]  Stop moving.
[1626.20s -> 1628.44s]  The screen is just to move in that direction.
[1628.44s -> 1631.13s]  It's like, wait, it's point and click?
[1631.13s -> 1633.13s]  Oh, okay, so should we do TV?
[1633.13s -> 1636.40s]  All right, we gotta go check on Tanya.
[1636.40s -> 1639.98s]  You know what would be really funny if he's just waiting for me up there
[1639.98s -> 1641.98s]  and I just get lost in the house
[1641.98s -> 1643.98s]  and his stream is fucked
[1643.98s -> 1645.98s]  because I cannot find a way up the stairs.
[1645.98s -> 1647.98s]  I don't think he realizes that that's possible
[1647.98s -> 1650.22s]  the entire time we play this.
[1650.22s -> 1652.22s]  Ooh, examine.
[1652.22s -> 1662.00s]  Crowd of innocence.
[1662.00s -> 1664.62s]  All right, pick it up.
[1664.62s -> 1670.62s]  A must read for anyone with an interest in the Salem Witch Trials of 1692.
[1670.62s -> 1673.69s]  This takes place during the Salem Witch Trials.
[1673.69s -> 1675.69s]  150, 200 years in the future.
[1675.69s -> 1678.06s]  Pretty cool.
[1678.06s -> 1680.62s]  Wait, what's this?
[1680.62s -> 1689.50s]  The New England Witch Trials.
[1689.50s -> 1692.96s]  What does that say?
[1692.96s -> 1695.77s]  The New England Witch Trials, right.
[1695.77s -> 1697.77s]  They just say the name of the book on the spine.
[1697.77s -> 1699.77s]  What rugs is he on?
[1699.77s -> 1702.20s]  I'm not on any of these rugs.
[1702.20s -> 1707.20s]  Today's not a CBD day.
[1707.20s -> 1709.20s]  Okay, I gotta go get Tanya.
[1709.20s -> 1719.37s]  Upstairs?
[1719.37s -> 1721.37s]  Imagine walking around your house like this,
[1721.37s -> 1728.99s]  like you have no idea where the fuck you're going.
[1728.99s -> 1730.99s]  I can't wait. Oh, we're locked in.
[1730.99s -> 1733.68s]  She locked the door.
[1733.68s -> 1737.13s]  She locked it. The little kid locked it.
[1737.13s -> 1739.13s]  I'm gonna go upstairs so, like, Italics' stream isn't ruined.
[1739.13s -> 1749.93s]  He's upstairs.
[1749.93s -> 1751.93s]  I don't know what that is.
[1751.93s -> 1759.68s]  Stairs?
[1759.68s -> 1761.68s]  This is just what your dog does
[1761.68s -> 1770.83s]  when you leave for the day.
[1770.83s -> 1772.83s]  And then eventually I'm gonna walk around in a circle
[1772.83s -> 1774.83s]  three or four times. Jesus Christ!
[1774.83s -> 1778.80s]  I'm gonna walk around in a circle
[1778.80s -> 1788.52s]  three times and lie down.
[1788.52s -> 1791.34s]  Open the door? Where's Tanya though?
[1791.34s -> 1803.76s]  I'm never gonna find him.
[1803.76s -> 1806.83s]  I'm sorry, Italics, I'm coming.
[1806.83s -> 1808.83s]  I'm coming, I'm coming.
[1808.83s -> 1814.08s]  Hey, Italics, did I hit the enrage timer?
[1819.28s -> 1823.31s]  Oh.
[1827.31s -> 1829.31s]  Too hot.
[1829.31s -> 1832.89s]  Too hot?
[1832.89s -> 1836.03s]  I thought that was her for a second.
[1836.03s -> 1838.03s]  Burning her head in the fire.
[1847.21s -> 1849.21s]  Uh, I am, I'm putting, I'm gonna
[1849.21s -> 1851.21s]  break every bone in my body to get this open.
[1853.39s -> 1855.39s]  I'm gonna full on jump through the glass
[1855.39s -> 1857.39s]  and shatter every bone in my body and like get all cuts all over me and shit.
[1857.39s -> 1859.39s]  This is quick.
[1859.39s -> 1861.39s]  Dad!
[1861.39s -> 1874.36s]  Good thing, hey, good thing I woke him up.
[1876.36s -> 1878.80s]  Dude.
[1878.80s -> 1886.09s]  Did we have prevented this?
[1886.09s -> 1888.09s]  Everyone's just dying.
[1892.09s -> 1897.79s]  We just accidentally
[1897.79s -> 1899.79s]  killed everybody.
[1901.79s -> 1903.79s]  What?
[1903.79s -> 1905.79s]  What?
[1905.79s -> 1911.47s]  Why is everybody trapped
[1911.47s -> 1913.47s]  in the house?
[1929.71s -> 1931.71s]  It's so loud.
[1931.71s -> 1934.46s]  Come on, Dad, you can do it.
[1934.46s -> 1937.08s]  Oh, Jesus, this is bad.
[1937.08s -> 1939.08s]  Get her out of there.
[1963.53s -> 1965.53s]  Did she do that?
[1965.53s -> 1974.30s]  Why did she do this?
[1974.30s -> 1979.29s]  Why is she, like, do you bleed
[1979.29s -> 1981.29s]  when you breathe smoke?
[1981.29s -> 1983.29s]  I think so.
[1983.29s -> 1985.47s]  It like burns you up.
[1985.47s -> 1994.22s]  Yeah.
[1994.22s -> 1996.59s]  What are you gonna do?
[1996.59s -> 1998.59s]  Tanya, hold on. I gotta get Megan out.
[1998.59s -> 2000.59s]  You're gonna go save Megan?
[2000.59s -> 2002.59s]  Alright, now roll your outro credits for your stream.
[2002.59s -> 2010.20s]  What?
[2010.20s -> 2014.16s]  Holy shit.
[2014.16s -> 2017.80s]  Oh my God.
[2017.80s -> 2019.80s]  Oh, that's horrible.
[2019.80s -> 2021.80s]  Holy shit. Why did...
[2021.80s -> 2028.01s]  Oh!
[2028.01s -> 2031.60s]  What happened?
[2031.60s -> 2039.34s]  What happened?
[2039.34s -> 2041.34s]  What did you do?
[2041.34s -> 2043.34s]  What did you do? What happened?
[2043.34s -> 2055.18s]  Uh, are you...
[2055.18s -> 2057.48s]  Did you take control of this character?
[2057.48s -> 2062.48s]  No, I'm sorry.
[2062.48s -> 2064.48s]  I don't know what I did.
[2064.48s -> 2066.48s]  I don't know what I did.
[2068.48s -> 2071.80s]  Why are they all getting, like,
[2071.80s -> 2081.98s]  mortal combated?
[2083.98s -> 2085.98s]  No, I don't think so.
[2085.98s -> 2087.98s]  What the fuck did I do then?
[2087.98s -> 2089.98s]  What are you doing? Why would you do that?
[2089.98s -> 2097.39s]  Went down with the ship.
[2097.39s -> 2099.39s]  He sprints in as the buildings
[2099.39s -> 2102.46s]  collapse.
[2102.46s -> 2104.46s]  I think that was just the intro.
[2104.46s -> 2108.04s]  Yeah, that's scripted.
[2108.04s -> 2110.67s]  That's pretty nuts.
[2110.67s -> 2112.67s]  I gotta, like, alt-tab again, but I don't want to crash the game.
[2112.67s -> 2114.67s]  Did you see, by any chance,
[2114.67s -> 2116.67s]  what happened in the house?
[2116.67s -> 2118.67s]  Uh, besides the fire
[2118.67s -> 2120.67s]  starting, no. I mean, I saw, like, the guy
[2120.67s -> 2122.67s]  crawling and getting crushed by beams.
[2122.67s -> 2124.67s]  Okay, dude.
[2124.67s -> 2126.67s]  Literally, the
[2126.67s -> 2128.67s]  little girl
[2128.67s -> 2130.67s]  burnt to death like she was on fire.
[2130.67s -> 2132.67s]  Hang on, I can hear you on this MTV music video.
[2132.67s -> 2137.28s]  They literally burnt a kid
[2137.28s -> 2139.45s]  to death.
[2139.45s -> 2141.45s]  Like she was on fire. It was fucking
[2141.45s -> 2146.00s]  insane. Uh, well,
[2146.00s -> 2148.00s]  was it as insane as my character hanging themselves
[2148.00s -> 2150.00s]  with a scarf? I mean, it was...
[2150.00s -> 2152.81s]  The whole thing was just fucked up.
[2152.81s -> 2155.37s]  Oh, we're supposed to...
[2155.37s -> 2157.37s]  We're supposed to know... Hold on, we're gonna get DMCA
[2157.37s -> 2160.06s]  for this, aren't we? Oh, yeah.
[2160.06s -> 2162.06s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2162.06s -> 2164.06s]  You just said the key word for today.
[2164.06s -> 2167.90s]  I hope it
[2167.90s -> 2170.33s]  was worth it.
[2170.33s -> 2172.33s]  Alright, this is real. Somebody in my
[2172.33s -> 2174.33s]  feed actually got a
[2174.33s -> 2176.76s]  YouTube claim. From this?
[2176.76s -> 2179.26s]  From Bandai Namco for, like, a
[2179.26s -> 2181.50s]  cutscene. Oh, fuck.
[2181.50s -> 2189.05s]  What do we do? Do we turn it off? Music?
[2189.05s -> 2191.05s]  What if it's just... Nah, I'm gonna leave
[2191.05s -> 2194.06s]  it on. Ah, fuck it, who cares.
[2194.06s -> 2196.06s]  It's just a game
[2196.06s -> 2199.00s]  song. I think that they custom-made
[2199.00s -> 2201.00s]  it for the game. No, no, this is like Pearl Jam,
[2201.00s -> 2210.80s]  I think. Why is it running so shitty?
[2210.80s -> 2215.21s]  And what... Why is this hallway so
[2215.21s -> 2217.45s]  long? It's Pearl Jam.
[2217.45s -> 2227.50s]  By super massive games.
[2227.50s -> 2233.13s]  Listen, I just want you to know that
[2233.13s -> 2235.13s]  when both of our channels get deleted,
[2235.13s -> 2237.95s]  it was a pleasure that
[2237.95s -> 2239.95s]  we go down with what IGN
[2239.95s -> 2241.95s]  has called a 5 out of 10
[2241.95s -> 2243.95s]  experience. Is it?
[2243.95s -> 2249.00s]  It's a 5 out of 10
[2249.00s -> 2251.00s]  game? According to IGN,
[2251.00s -> 2256.76s]  yes. IGN giving a
[2256.76s -> 2258.76s]  game a 5 out of 10 means it's a 0.
[2258.76s -> 2267.40s]  I don't think I believe that so far.
[2267.40s -> 2272.01s]  I was... Hold on. I remember this guy.
[2272.01s -> 2274.62s]  Who's in the window.
[2274.62s -> 2276.80s]  Hello. Hi.
[2276.80s -> 2278.80s]  And welcome. I don't believe
[2278.80s -> 2281.16s]  that we've met before, have we?
[2281.16s -> 2283.85s]  No, Matt. Welcome to my repository.
[2283.85s -> 2285.85s]  I
[2285.85s -> 2288.09s]  am the curator.
[2288.09s -> 2290.09s]  The guardian of all these wonderful
[2290.09s -> 2292.09s]  stories. We have met, though. Yeah, we have.
[2292.09s -> 2294.09s]  And I have a very special tale
[2294.09s -> 2296.09s]  for you to tell. We were talking before the stream
[2296.09s -> 2298.09s]  started and we were like, yeah, it definitely doesn't remember
[2298.09s -> 2301.80s]  your save.
[2301.80s -> 2309.23s]  I didn't put that in.
[2309.23s -> 2311.23s]  Salem Witch Trials in his
[2311.23s -> 2313.23s]  encyclopedia of scary stories.
[2313.23s -> 2315.23s]  Disconcerting, no?
[2315.23s -> 2317.85s]  This guy looks like Bugleberry.
[2317.85s -> 2319.85s]  Is this like a stick bug joke?
[2319.85s -> 2322.35s]  This particular
[2322.35s -> 2324.35s]  story isn't fully fleshed
[2324.35s -> 2326.35s]  out. It's only part
[2326.35s -> 2328.35s]  written and the choices you make
[2328.35s -> 2333.79s]  will complete it.
[2333.79s -> 2335.79s]  Fire? No, there was nothing
[2335.79s -> 2338.54s]  you could have done about it. What's happened has happened.
[2338.54s -> 2341.10s]  Or has it?
[2341.10s -> 2343.92s]  Anyway, look to the future,
[2343.92s -> 2346.35s]  I say. Life's
[2346.35s -> 2348.35s]  but a walking shadow, eh?
[2348.35s -> 2352.06s]  You are about to enter
[2352.06s -> 2354.81s]  a confusing
[2354.81s -> 2356.81s]  perhaps disturbing
[2356.81s -> 2358.81s]  world. I like the idea that he's actually talking to a camera crew.
[2358.81s -> 2360.81s]  How disturbing might depend on what
[2360.81s -> 2362.81s]  you choose to believe and how
[2362.81s -> 2364.81s]  confusing on the path
[2364.81s -> 2366.81s]  you choose to take.
[2366.81s -> 2371.42s]  There are an infinite number
[2371.42s -> 2373.42s]  of directions in which one could
[2373.42s -> 2375.42s]  actually there's three in this game
[2375.42s -> 2377.42s]  that actually matter.
[2377.42s -> 2379.42s]  Left option, right option,
[2379.42s -> 2381.42s]  and say nothing. Right.
[2396.36s -> 2398.36s]  What?
[2398.36s -> 2400.36s]  Wait!
[2405.31s -> 2407.31s]  What?
[2417.31s -> 2419.31s]  We get to change the fire?
[2425.84s -> 2427.84s]  He leans down and just screams into the book.
[2429.84s -> 2431.84s]  Do you think they made this intro because
[2431.84s -> 2433.84s]  they watched our man of Medan complain
[2433.84s -> 2435.84s]  about how long it took for anyone
[2435.84s -> 2437.84s]  to die?
[2443.66s -> 2445.66s]  They're like, oh yeah? What if I kill every
[2445.66s -> 2447.66s]  character in the first intro?
[2447.66s -> 2449.66s]  What now?
[2449.66s -> 2451.66s]  They just give us new characters.
[2453.66s -> 2455.66s]  Alright, I didn't sign up for poetry class. I want to fucking see
[2455.66s -> 2457.66s]  monsters and Satan and
[2457.66s -> 2463.10s]  stabbing.
[2463.10s -> 2465.10s]  Okay, but like, you did.
[2465.10s -> 2467.47s]  That's what we just did.
[2474.25s -> 2477.64s]  Okay, gee man.
[2477.64s -> 2479.64s]  What is that supposed to mean?
[2500.70s -> 2502.70s]  I'm sorry, that's just like...
[2502.70s -> 2504.70s]  It's a photo.
[2508.94s -> 2510.94s]  No, but just the way he said that, he's like,
[2510.94s -> 2512.94s]  there are photos. Like this one of my kitty.
[2512.94s -> 2524.25s]  Here we go.
[2524.25s -> 2528.67s]  Cue the rock music and the car
[2528.67s -> 2530.67s]  driving really fast and the teenagers
[2530.67s -> 2532.67s]  just not listening to any fucking rules.
[2532.67s -> 2543.28s]  Never mind, it's a funeral.
[2543.28s -> 2545.28s]  The Bible's all wet.
[2554.46s -> 2556.46s]  Who are these people?
[2556.46s -> 2568.49s]  I mean, not to be like,
[2568.49s -> 2572.33s]  didn't everybody die?
[2572.33s -> 2574.33s]  The guy with the keychain thing
[2574.33s -> 2576.33s]  is Tanya's...
[2576.33s -> 2578.33s]  Well, am I allowed to tell you anything?
[2578.33s -> 2580.33s]  I don't know, do you have info that I'm supposed to know?
[2580.33s -> 2582.33s]  I don't know what I'm supposed to say or not say.
[2582.33s -> 2584.33s]  Oh, I think it's alright.
[2584.33s -> 2586.33s]  If we're sitting in the same spot, it's fine.
[2586.33s -> 2588.33s]  The one guy is Tanya's boyfriend.
[2588.33s -> 2590.33s]  Oh, okay.
[2590.33s -> 2593.66s]  She's dead though.
[2593.66s -> 2595.66s]  When we're not standing in the same spot,
[2595.66s -> 2597.66s]  that's when we...wait.
[2597.66s -> 2599.66s]  Wait, this person's alive.
[2599.66s -> 2603.36s]  Eighteen?
[2603.36s -> 2605.36s]  Dude's like thirty-six in real life.
[2605.36s -> 2607.36s]  Wait, but he's alive.
[2607.36s -> 2620.27s]  Where is he?
[2620.27s -> 2622.27s]  Taylor, twenty-two, college student, headstrong,
[2622.27s -> 2624.27s]  sensitive.
[2624.27s -> 2626.27s]  Did I get to create a new character now?
[2626.27s -> 2628.70s]  Gone. College professor, rational,
[2628.70s -> 2630.70s]  overbearing.
[2632.70s -> 2636.99s]  Oh, you are...
[2636.99s -> 2638.99s]  It's on the bus push.
[2638.99s -> 2640.99s]  Oh, right.
[2640.99s -> 2642.99s]  I forgot about that. I thought that was so long ago
[2642.99s -> 2645.36s]  and so random that it was like, what's the point of this?
[2652.35s -> 2654.35s]  These guys are all thirty-four pretending to be like
[2654.35s -> 2656.35s]  eighteen-year-old college kids.
[2661.90s -> 2665.92s]  Alright. I'm headstrong.
[2665.92s -> 2667.92s]  Angela, eighteen.
[2667.92s -> 2669.92s]  Mature student in college.
[2676.80s -> 2679.68s]  What?
[2685.68s -> 2689.07s]  I thought they were at the fire.
[2689.07s -> 2691.07s]  No, this is the bus crash.
[2691.07s -> 2695.87s]  That was just a dream.
[2695.87s -> 2697.87s]  This is gonna be a Freddy Krueger thing.
[2697.87s -> 2704.72s]  You can die in like a dream in like a nightmare and stuff.
[2715.08s -> 2717.64s]  Who do I control?
[2717.64s -> 2719.64s]  Angela, forty-eight. Mature student.
[2719.64s -> 2721.64s]  Abrasive, understanding.
[2721.64s -> 2723.64s]  But it did tell us who we are.
[2723.64s -> 2725.64s]  So you're Taylor, I'm Daniel.
[2742.94s -> 2745.44s]  Nobody's good.
[2745.44s -> 2747.44s]  I really hope that the old lady does that.
[2749.44s -> 2751.44s]  I'm gonna do everything possible to make sure that
[2751.44s -> 2753.44s]  that old lady stays alive.
[2758.25s -> 2760.25s]  No sign of him.
[2760.25s -> 2762.25s]  Weird. He isn't up here either.
[2762.25s -> 2764.25s]  Can you get back up to us?
[2764.25s -> 2766.88s]  Looks pretty steep.
[2766.88s -> 2768.88s]  I see a trail down here I could try.
[2768.88s -> 2770.88s]  I mean, that's not that steep.
[2770.88s -> 2772.88s]  Should take you to the road.
[2772.88s -> 2775.18s]  We can regroup there.
[2775.18s -> 2777.18s]  That's a plan. See you soon.
[2777.18s -> 2779.18s]  I wanna control...no, I wanna be the old lady.
[2779.18s -> 2781.18s]  I like old ladies.
[2781.18s -> 2785.02s]  Hey, Taylor.
[2785.02s -> 2787.32s]  Help me get Andrew up on his feet, will ya?
[2787.32s -> 2790.51s]  Wait, I don't remember anything.
[2790.51s -> 2792.94s]  That amnesia.
[2801.48s -> 2803.48s]  Where are they taking these kids on this field trip?
[2807.48s -> 2815.10s]  Why are there only four people?
[2817.10s -> 2819.10s]  I didn't fail the first QTE, we're good.
[2830.12s -> 2833.00s]  Why don't we just call somebody for help?
[2837.76s -> 2839.76s]  There's food in that bus.
[2839.76s -> 2841.76s]  There's a bathroom in that bus.
[2845.76s -> 2848.57s]  What about the guy that drove the bus?
[2848.57s -> 2850.57s]  Wait, did he drive the bus?
[2852.57s -> 2854.57s]  Oh no, the bus driver.
[2854.57s -> 2859.18s]  Okay.
[2867.12s -> 2869.12s]  Oh, fuck you, John.
[2874.28s -> 2876.28s]  Hey, look.
[2876.28s -> 2878.28s]  He's a professor of fucking artificial flavorings.
[2880.52s -> 2882.89s]  It was a really easy class to take.
[2882.89s -> 2884.89s]  Don't put that much judgment on him.
[2891.23s -> 2895.69s]  What is that?
[2895.69s -> 2898.00s]  Letterbox?
[2898.00s -> 2901.96s]  Yeah, I have a letterbox.
[2901.96s -> 2904.27s]  Are we not supposed to have letterboxes?
[2904.27s -> 2907.72s]  I kinda like it.
[2907.72s -> 2910.92s]  Wait, are we together?
[2914.92s -> 2916.92s]  Oh, okay.
[2916.92s -> 2932.33s]  Mute. There's nothing here.
[2932.33s -> 2942.96s]  Alright, leave. Run, run, run, run, run, run.
[2942.96s -> 2945.58s]  He's gonna get scooped up by an eagle or something, isn't he?
[2945.58s -> 2948.14s]  I know he is.
[2948.14s -> 2955.31s]  He's going way too fast in front of us.
[2955.31s -> 2957.31s]  Why are there MOBA controls?
[2957.31s -> 2964.14s]  Hold on.
[2969.20s -> 2975.85s]  Doesn't that fucking hurt after a while, by the way?
[2975.85s -> 2977.85s]  If you click that much.
[2977.85s -> 2980.92s]  People that play League and Dota.
[2980.92s -> 2984.64s]  All day.
[2992.94s -> 2995.50s]  I love her.
[2995.50s -> 2997.50s]  I love her already.
[3016.97s -> 3020.56s]  Oh, that was easy.
[3022.99s -> 3024.99s]  That's the real college kids.
[3024.99s -> 3026.99s]  Paying attention at how leverage works.
[3026.99s -> 3028.99s]  I'm just waiting for a car just to drive.
[3028.99s -> 3031.16s]  All of them.
[3031.16s -> 3033.47s]  This is the detour road.
[3035.64s -> 3037.64s]  Nobody goes this way.
[3037.64s -> 3039.64s]  That's why we crash and we're pissed.
[3039.64s -> 3041.64s]  I'm a psycho?
[3048.76s -> 3050.76s]  I'm playing a certain character here.
[3052.76s -> 3054.76s]  We're both playing certain characters.
[3057.96s -> 3059.96s]  Uh...
[3059.96s -> 3062.78s]  That's right.
[3064.78s -> 3070.84s]  Come on.
[3072.84s -> 3075.60s]  Ah, she's kind of a bitch.
[3075.60s -> 3077.60s]  I don't like her anymore.
[3077.60s -> 3082.33s]  No, I liked her!
[3091.56s -> 3098.59s]  Oh no, she's sad.
[3102.59s -> 3106.68s]  Oh no.
[3110.89s -> 3112.89s]  No, I like her again.
[3112.89s -> 3114.89s]  What was that?
[3114.89s -> 3116.89s]  What was that for?
[3123.76s -> 3125.76s]  Is nobody going to bring that up?
[3125.76s -> 3127.76s]  Why were you just violently coughing?
[3130.51s -> 3133.58s]  Not like, are you alright?
[3133.58s -> 3138.44s]  Why is your character like, the most manipulative?
[3138.44s -> 3140.44s]  Because that's how I'm playing it.
[3142.44s -> 3146.48s]  We were all in the fire.
[3146.48s -> 3148.48s]  I mean, we were all in the fire.
[3148.48s -> 3152.32s]  This is coughing, the...
[3164.64s -> 3166.64s]  Didn't Silent Hill do this like 15 years ago?
[3166.64s -> 3168.64s]  Fuck.
[3185.66s -> 3187.66s]  Write me out of the story, please.
[3189.96s -> 3191.96s]  It's not possible. Sprint.
[3191.96s -> 3195.74s]  Why does it go, what?
[3201.18s -> 3203.18s]  I am so confused, what is happening?
[3203.18s -> 3205.18s]  Why are they doing this?
[3205.18s -> 3210.68s]  And they can't...
[3210.68s -> 3212.68s]  Oh, so it's like Pac-Man.
[3224.68s -> 3226.68s]  My question, how long did these other three people stand
[3226.68s -> 3228.68s]  waiting for them to do this three different times?
[3230.68s -> 3232.68s]  Yeah, how far is it? Is it a mile?
[3232.68s -> 3234.68s]  Two miles? Five miles?
[3241.44s -> 3243.87s]  Who, alright.
[3243.87s -> 3249.95s]  Make your prediction right now.
[3249.95s -> 3251.95s]  Who's the first to die? Who do you think?
[3255.58s -> 3257.58s]  Just out of the people we've played as, or this whole group?
[3257.58s -> 3259.58s]  Just like this group here, who's the first to go?
[3259.58s -> 3263.16s]  Guy with glasses.
[3263.16s -> 3265.16s]  I would say the same thing. Professor's dead first.
[3265.16s -> 3267.16s]  Like I said, an eagle's gonna swoop him out of the fucking sky.
[3283.39s -> 3285.39s]  True.
[3291.95s -> 3293.95s]  Throwing that one out right at the beginning.
[3303.95s -> 3305.95s]  How can we hear them twice?
[3305.95s -> 3307.95s]  Did you hear an echo too? Yeah.
[3307.95s -> 3309.95s]  They're all turning into demons.
[3322.56s -> 3324.56s]  I'm defusing the scenario.
[3324.56s -> 3326.56s]  I'm defusing the scenario.
[3338.86s -> 3340.86s]  The real nightmare is 50 miles an hour on a two-lane road.
[3344.86s -> 3346.86s]  What, we're on drugs?
[3356.88s -> 3358.88s]  They should just hold hands,
[3358.88s -> 3360.88s]  and have one person keep walking while they keep holding their hand
[3360.88s -> 3363.82s]  and see if their arm rips off.
[3365.82s -> 3367.82s]  What?
[3367.82s -> 3369.82s]  Like make a chain,
[3369.82s -> 3371.82s]  and shimmy to the left,
[3371.82s -> 3373.82s]  until the person all the way to the left disappears
[3373.82s -> 3376.00s]  or gets their arm ripped off.
[3378.17s -> 3380.17s]  Okay, god, let's take that thing instead of ripping their arm off.
[3382.17s -> 3384.17s]  Start breaking off like tree branches.
[3384.17s -> 3386.17s]  And use those as like links.
[3388.17s -> 3390.17s]  Just build a shelter and live here.
[3390.17s -> 3392.48s]  Eat the fucking rabbits.
[3396.48s -> 3398.48s]  Oh, he zoomed in on that.
[3398.48s -> 3400.48s]  We were just in a car crash.
[3402.48s -> 3407.21s]  Dude, you have a scratch on your face.
[3407.21s -> 3409.21s]  What the fuck happened?
[3409.21s -> 3411.21s]  We were just in a fucking car crash, stupid.
[3411.21s -> 3413.21s]  What are you talking about?
[3413.21s -> 3415.21s]  All right, stick close to the others.
[3415.21s -> 3417.21s]  Follow John, they're already going.
[3417.21s -> 3419.21s]  All right, go, go, go.
[3419.21s -> 3421.21s]  Okay, RB pauses for some unknown reason.
[3421.21s -> 3425.69s]  Here we go again.
[3425.69s -> 3427.69s]  Uh-oh.
[3427.69s -> 3437.10s]  Listen, I'm not the developer that made RB
[3437.10s -> 3439.45s]  on a controller pause the whole game
[3439.45s -> 3441.45s]  and then crash the game.
[3441.45s -> 3443.45s]  It's not my fault that you get soft-locked
[3443.45s -> 3445.45s]  after a single pause in the game.
[3445.45s -> 3447.63s]  Okay, there's no menu on my screen.
[3447.63s -> 3449.63s]  So is this,
[3449.63s -> 3452.25s]  I don't know.
[3452.25s -> 3455.50s]  So now you're locked out.
[3455.50s -> 3457.50s]  What about now?
[3457.50s -> 3461.21s]  There's no menu, it's just a screenshot.
[3461.21s -> 3467.60s]  All right, let's go back to the main menu.
[3467.60s -> 3469.60s]  Let's do it again. We got to continue.
[3469.60s -> 3471.90s]  We got to start right here.
[3471.90s -> 3473.90s]  I need to figure out any other buttons
[3473.90s -> 3476.14s]  that just pause the game for some reason.
[3476.14s -> 3479.92s]  So I don't push them.
[3479.92s -> 3481.92s]  Surge, tune, waiting room.
[3481.92s -> 3483.92s]  All right, that actually kicked me out
[3483.92s -> 3487.31s]  back to the main menu without having to restart the game.
[3487.31s -> 3489.31s]  Why does RB pause the game?
[3489.31s -> 3499.80s]  That's odd. This is your out.
[3499.80s -> 3502.30s]  Take it. No.
[3502.30s -> 3504.30s]  We've only just started.
[3504.30s -> 3507.24s]  We're in like chapter one
[3507.24s -> 3511.47s]  after the prologue.
[3511.47s -> 3517.92s]  I invite you. Are you good?
[3517.92s -> 3519.92s]  It's doing like a 10 second long animation
[3519.92s -> 3522.60s]  but yes.
[3522.60s -> 3525.42s]  Are they supposed to be here?
[3525.42s -> 3528.17s]  I feel like they just
[3528.17s -> 3532.65s]  got ported in here for no reason.
[3532.65s -> 3545.07s]  I don't think these models are supposed to be here.
[3545.07s -> 3547.07s]  If I had a 10, I wouldn't say that yet.
[3547.07s -> 3556.80s]  I wouldn't say that yet.
[3556.80s -> 3559.74s]  Hey look.
[3559.74s -> 3561.74s]  I think it's just telling us we have to choose
[3561.74s -> 3566.80s]  a play style.
[3566.80s -> 3568.97s]  Can we skip this?
[3570.97s -> 3572.97s]  No.
[3583.34s -> 3585.34s]  All right.
[3585.34s -> 3587.34s]  Someone else needs to do a better job.
[3587.34s -> 3589.34s]  He's been standing still
[3589.34s -> 3591.64s]  for half an hour.
[3593.64s -> 3595.64s]  The only thing they've tried so far
[3595.64s -> 3597.64s]  is walk down the road three times.
[3597.64s -> 3599.64s]  Yeah.
[3599.64s -> 3601.64s]  That's horrible.
[3618.35s -> 3620.35s]  When did we establish
[3620.35s -> 3622.35s]  the fog?
[3622.35s -> 3624.72s]  I think they just guessed.
[3626.72s -> 3628.72s]  Yeah.
[3628.72s -> 3630.72s]  We played Man of Medan.
[3630.72s -> 3632.72s]  The fog is just like a barrel
[3632.72s -> 3634.72s]  leaking somewhere.
[3634.72s -> 3637.60s]  If they do a Man of Medan
[3637.60s -> 3639.60s]  again where it's like this is a gas
[3639.60s -> 3641.60s]  in the air and it's making us just like crazy
[3641.60s -> 3643.60s]  then I'm not fine.
[3643.60s -> 3648.20s]  You know what I mean?
[3648.20s -> 3650.64s]  This is the town that produces the gas.
[3650.64s -> 3657.61s]  Spoilers for Man of Medan.
[3657.61s -> 3659.61s]  Yeah but this is Man of Medan 2.
[3659.61s -> 3661.61s]  Smog of Medan.
[3665.85s -> 3667.85s]  Smog of Medan.
[3669.85s -> 3671.85s]  All right. It's Alex. Is this game
[3671.85s -> 3673.85s]  Man of Medan 2 in your brain?
[3673.85s -> 3675.85s]  This is not Little Hope. This is Man of Medan 2.
[3675.85s -> 3677.85s]  This is not the Dark Pictures anthology.
[3680.99s -> 3684.56s]  Cat. Cat. Cat.
[3691.42s -> 3695.39s]  I hope there's some Monty Python level shit
[3695.39s -> 3697.39s]  where the cat just like jumps up and bites
[3697.39s -> 3702.19s]  one of our necks.
[3702.19s -> 3704.19s]  Dude's cat.
[3704.19s -> 3706.19s]  That's the story teller.
[3706.19s -> 3708.19s]  Why are you doing this like Chad
[3708.19s -> 3710.56s]  side to sidewalk?
[3710.56s -> 3713.24s]  I'm just going man.
[3713.24s -> 3715.24s]  I didn't see it.
[3717.24s -> 3719.55s]  Who am I now?
[3719.55s -> 3722.68s]  I'm Taylor.
[3722.68s -> 3725.76s]  Are you old lady?
[3725.76s -> 3727.76s]  I wish that was me.
[3742.01s -> 3744.32s]  Why aren't we going with those guys?
[3744.32s -> 3746.32s]  Angela knows there's something between us.
[3746.32s -> 3748.32s]  Why aren't we going with them?
[3748.32s -> 3750.32s]  It's a horror game. You have to split up.
[3750.32s -> 3752.32s]  I'm talking to you right now?
[3752.32s -> 3754.32s]  This is a big deal for me anyhow.
[3754.32s -> 3756.32s]  No.
[3756.32s -> 3758.32s]  Why can you hear this?
[3758.32s -> 3766.68s]  You're like six feet away.
[3766.68s -> 3768.68s]  Did you blab to her about us?
[3768.68s -> 3770.68s]  Of course not. Didn't say a word.
[3770.68s -> 3775.48s]  You absolutely sure you didn't blab about us?
[3775.48s -> 3777.48s]  You don't believe me?
[3777.48s -> 3779.66s]  I believe she's smart enough to
[3779.66s -> 3781.66s]  I went down. I got down on
[3781.66s -> 3783.66s]  Daniel.
[3783.66s -> 3785.66s]  Daniel down arrow.
[3785.66s -> 3787.66s]  I just wanted to be sure.
[3787.66s -> 3789.66s]  I don't know what I did wrong.
[3789.66s -> 3793.18s]  You better.
[3793.18s -> 3795.18s]  I'm not sure.
[3795.18s -> 3797.55s]  I'll let Chad take it from here.
[3797.55s -> 3799.55s]  Concussion can scramble your memory.
[3799.55s -> 3801.55s]  Everyone is Ben Shapiro.
[3801.55s -> 3803.98s]  That's wicked funny.
[3803.98s -> 3807.69s]  Even me. Me too.
[3807.69s -> 3812.68s]  We standing here all night or we going inside?
[3812.68s -> 3814.68s]  All of us here are Ben.
[3814.68s -> 3826.00s]  Oh.
[3826.00s -> 3828.00s]  Ew. Stop.
[3828.00s -> 3830.00s]  You brought it up. I didn't bring it up.
[3830.00s -> 3832.00s]  I'm reacting. I'm going to react Andy to what you're doing.
[3832.00s -> 3841.08s]  This is the most business
[3841.08s -> 3845.44s]  this bar has gotten.
[3845.44s -> 3847.44s]  Yeah. This guy. I'm surprised he doesn't jump up
[3847.44s -> 3849.44s]  and start wiping the counter and being like what can I get you?
[3849.44s -> 3851.44s]  Holy shit. Five people.
[3851.44s -> 3854.32s]  Ding ding ding ding.
[3854.32s -> 3859.93s]  Hi there. How you doing?
[3859.93s -> 3861.93s]  Hey. Your bus crashed too.
[3861.93s -> 3863.93s]  But we're looking for our bus driver.
[3863.93s -> 3875.31s]  What? Have you seen him? What is?
[3875.31s -> 3877.31s]  Look at the fog outside.
[3877.31s -> 3879.31s]  It's pretty weird.
[3879.31s -> 3881.31s]  Yeah. It sure is a thick one tonight.
[3881.31s -> 3883.31s]  So thick it's stopping us from leaving.
[3883.31s -> 3885.55s]  Dick.
[3885.55s -> 3887.55s]  This is the character that knows the
[3887.55s -> 3889.55s]  mysticism behind the town.
[3889.55s -> 3891.55s]  No.
[3891.55s -> 3893.55s]  This is the character that got stuck here before you did.
[3893.55s -> 3895.55s]  Oh shit. God damn it. You're right.
[3895.55s -> 3899.26s]  How about a game?
[3899.26s -> 3903.60s]  Seriously? You want to throw darts?
[3903.60s -> 3905.60s]  Don't be like that. Ten bucks.
[3905.60s -> 3908.60s]  Says you can't hit the bullseye.
[3908.60s -> 3910.60s]  Sounds like fighting talk to me.
[3910.60s -> 3914.00s]  I'm playing darts.
[3914.00s -> 3918.60s]  Let's do it.
[3918.60s -> 3921.23s]  How do you play darts?
[3921.23s -> 3923.90s]  Go for single twenty.
[3923.90s -> 3925.90s]  What was that supposed to be?
[3925.90s -> 3931.34s]  Single twenty.
[3931.34s -> 3933.34s]  Beginner's luck. Try for double seven.
[3933.34s -> 3937.74s]  Double seven.
[3937.74s -> 3940.56s]  I don't know what that means. Right here?
[3940.56s -> 3942.56s]  At least my eyesight seems okay.
[3942.56s -> 3945.10s]  Great shooting.
[3945.10s -> 3947.10s]  Go for the bullseye with your last dart.
[3947.10s -> 3949.10s]  I just turn and I throw the dart right into his eye.
[3949.10s -> 3955.44s]  Okay.
[3955.44s -> 3957.44s]  You got the walk to back up the talk.
[3957.44s -> 3959.87s]  Stop pretending.
[3959.87s -> 3961.87s]  Stuck here with these guys?
[3961.87s -> 3963.87s]  Because of that fog?
[3963.87s -> 3969.76s]  How do you feel about all this shit?
[3969.76s -> 3971.76s]  We're in deep shit here and those guys are no help.
[3971.76s -> 3974.32s]  Don't beat around the bush.
[3974.32s -> 3977.56s]  Say what you're really thinking.
[3977.56s -> 3979.56s]  You doing okay?
[3979.56s -> 3981.56s]  Am I trying to like save us from the fog
[3981.56s -> 3983.56s]  while you're playing darts?
[3983.56s -> 3986.70s]  Probably. I'm just having a good time over here.
[3986.70s -> 3990.54s]  Wait. This is an important decision.
[3990.54s -> 3992.54s]  Just because he's our professor doesn't mean
[3992.54s -> 3994.54s]  John can act like he's in charge.
[3994.54s -> 3996.54s]  Are you talking about me in front of me?
[3996.54s -> 3998.54s]  I'm right.
[3998.54s -> 4000.54s]  You can hear this?
[4000.54s -> 4003.60s]  They need to figure out how to speak with
[4003.60s -> 4005.60s]  volume control.
[4005.60s -> 4009.63s]  Are you talking shit?
[4009.63s -> 4011.63s]  I'm going to show you how to bullseye
[4011.63s -> 4013.63s]  three in a row.
[4013.63s -> 4015.63s]  You're going to hit the fucking wall.
[4015.63s -> 4017.63s]  You're going to be that guy that's at the party
[4017.63s -> 4019.63s]  that throws two into the guy's fucking wall.
[4019.63s -> 4021.63s]  The drywall. And it's like fuck.
[4021.63s -> 4026.11s]  How much is the drywall, man? I'm sorry.
[4026.11s -> 4028.11s]  Don't worry about it, dude. Don't worry about it.
[4028.11s -> 4030.11s]  Just give it to somebody else.
[4030.11s -> 4032.41s]  I'm literally playing now.
[4032.41s -> 4034.41s]  Oh, you are playing.
[4034.41s -> 4036.41s]  I took the controller out of your hand.
[4036.41s -> 4038.41s]  I made you go look around.
[4038.41s -> 4040.78s]  Can I just stand there?
[4040.78s -> 4047.93s]  Okay.
[4047.93s -> 4049.93s]  My game just got stuck.
[4049.93s -> 4051.93s]  This place is a bust. There's nothing for us here.
[4051.93s -> 4053.93s]  For once, I agree.
[4053.93s -> 4055.93s]  The sooner we're gone from this dreadful place,
[4055.93s -> 4057.93s]  the better.
[4057.93s -> 4061.20s]  I hit a bullseye, too.
[4061.20s -> 4063.95s]  Just saying.
[4065.95s -> 4067.95s]  I hit three bullseyes in a row.
[4067.95s -> 4069.95s]  You actually don't go for the middle, though.
[4069.95s -> 4071.95s]  Yes, you do. Every time.
[4071.95s -> 4073.95s]  When you throw the second one, it splits the first one in half.
[4073.95s -> 4075.95s]  And the third one splits the second one in half.
[4077.95s -> 4080.70s]  Talk to this guy.
[4080.70s -> 4082.70s]  What?
[4082.70s -> 4085.39s]  No, he didn't.
[4085.39s -> 4092.68s]  I want to talk to this person.
[4098.91s -> 4105.12s]  We all drink too much from time to time.
[4105.12s -> 4107.55s]  Now what?
[4107.55s -> 4109.98s]  Can't a guy get some peace around here?
[4109.98s -> 4112.99s]  Is the phone working?
[4112.99s -> 4115.23s]  The phone sure seems like it's broken.
[4115.23s -> 4117.72s]  I already told you it was dead.
[4117.72s -> 4119.72s]  Are you okay?
[4119.72s -> 4124.19s]  Yeah.
[4124.19s -> 4126.19s]  Are you okay?
[4126.19s -> 4128.81s]  Nothing's okay.
[4128.81s -> 4131.50s]  I can't escape.
[4131.50s -> 4133.68s]  Escape what?
[4133.68s -> 4135.68s]  Fog?
[4135.68s -> 4137.68s]  The D-socks?
[4137.68s -> 4140.75s]  No, that's not a Red Sox hat.
[4140.75s -> 4145.74s]  That's not a Boston Red Sox hat.
[4145.74s -> 4149.45s]  Dead Sox.
[4149.45s -> 4151.45s]  Yeah, that's not a V.
[4151.45s -> 4153.45s]  I mean, I know where they're going.
[4153.45s -> 4155.45s]  I mean, it's probably trademark laws where you can't be like
[4155.45s -> 4163.07s]  the Boston Red Sox, maybe.
[4163.07s -> 4166.91s]  Deadsec.
[4166.91s -> 4171.26s]  Why is everyone just eerily sitting around?
[4171.26s -> 4173.26s]  The Zosten Zed Sox.
[4173.26s -> 4176.00s]  Alright, that's enough.
[4176.00s -> 4180.03s]  I don't want to hear it anymore.
[4180.03s -> 4186.75s]  Alright, what do I do? Who do I talk to?
[4186.75s -> 4191.36s]  Can I talk to him?
[4191.36s -> 4193.36s]  I'm just being an NPC in every video game.
[4193.36s -> 4198.35s]  I'm just waiting for someone to come over
[4198.35s -> 4200.35s]  and hit me with a fucking chair for fun.
[4200.35s -> 4211.15s]  What's this?
[4211.15s -> 4215.56s]  It's a secret. Turn it upside down.
[4215.56s -> 4217.56s]  This is riveting gameplay, Jerma.
[4217.56s -> 4219.56s]  It's a story game.
[4219.56s -> 4221.56s]  What do you want me to go drive a car and run over
[4221.56s -> 4223.87s]  a hundred people out there?
[4223.87s -> 4229.18s]  This is a story game.
[4229.18s -> 4231.18s]  Oh, I may have yoinked everybody.
[4231.18s -> 4233.18s]  I was just walking around like an NPC anyways.
[4242.32s -> 4250.99s]  Why are we assuming that that guy cannot hear that?
[4261.50s -> 4264.96s]  Yeah, and...
[4264.96s -> 4267.20s]  Don't, the Zosten Zed Sox!
[4267.20s -> 4269.20s]  Docs, I said wrong.
[4278.57s -> 4280.81s]  That's a lot of minus two's.
[4280.81s -> 4286.68s]  Fuck.
[4290.20s -> 4292.20s]  The...
[4292.20s -> 4294.20s]  It's like 11 PM.
[4294.20s -> 4296.20s]  It's closing time.
[4298.20s -> 4302.75s]  Yeah.
[4302.75s -> 4304.75s]  Cool. I am Andrew.
[4304.75s -> 4308.06s]  Let's go.
[4308.06s -> 4311.00s]  Continue toward the town.
[4311.00s -> 4315.68s]  Keep up with John and the others.
[4315.68s -> 4320.03s]  Yeah, sorry, we're controlled by players.
[4320.03s -> 4322.03s]  You just go squat over there and piss behind a bush.
[4322.03s -> 4327.08s]  That'd be funny.
[4327.08s -> 4329.08s]  Dude!
[4329.08s -> 4332.99s]  Go on, hit start.
[4332.99s -> 4334.99s]  Hang on, let me ready first.
[4334.99s -> 4336.99s]  You unready, because I still have a menu here.
[4336.99s -> 4338.99s]  Who's supposed to ready first?
[4338.99s -> 4341.87s]  You.
[4341.87s -> 4343.87s]  Like, what have we done last time?
[4343.87s -> 4346.36s]  Do you ready first last time and that's what freezes us?
[4346.36s -> 4348.36s]  I don't know.
[4348.36s -> 4350.36s]  They made too many buttons on the controller pause the game for no reason.
[4350.36s -> 4352.36s]  Listen, in my defense,
[4352.36s -> 4354.36s]  everyone knows when you're playing a new game
[4354.36s -> 4356.36s]  and you got a controller, you push every button on the controller
[4356.36s -> 4358.36s]  to see what it does.
[4358.36s -> 4361.12s]  Right?
[4361.12s -> 4366.73s]  You just do.
[4366.73s -> 4368.91s]  I do press like every button on my keyboard.
[4368.91s -> 4370.91s]  I just mash my face into it.
[4370.91s -> 4372.91s]  Thank you, we're good.
[4372.91s -> 4376.49s]  People telling you to stop using a controller.
[4376.49s -> 4381.93s]  Okay, that's chat saying that.
[4381.93s -> 4383.93s]  Do anybody even listen to what they say?
[4383.93s -> 4386.62s]  Ever?
[4386.62s -> 4390.08s]  I do.
[4390.08s -> 4393.34s]  I think I'm losing you, by the way.
[4393.34s -> 4396.08s]  Was that you?
[4396.08s -> 4398.08s]  That's because the sprint button is LB
[4398.08s -> 4400.08s]  and the pause button is RB.
[4400.08s -> 4402.08s]  You just sprinted by.
[4402.08s -> 4407.58s]  Wait, did you just sprint by?
[4407.58s -> 4411.87s]  No.
[4411.87s -> 4413.87s]  You're so far behind.
[4413.87s -> 4415.87s]  Listen, hang on, slow down, I'm behind you.
[4415.87s -> 4419.71s]  Hey, can you come over here?
[4419.71s -> 4423.28s]  Come over here.
[4423.28s -> 4425.45s]  You're not the old lady.
[4425.45s -> 4427.45s]  Oh, you are.
[4427.45s -> 4432.64s]  Will you quit screwing around?
[4432.64s -> 4435.84s]  I definitely saw someone.
[4435.84s -> 4440.19s]  I saw somebody, man.
[4440.19s -> 4443.00s]  What did you see?
[4443.00s -> 4445.00s]  Remember when those two AIs talked to each other
[4445.00s -> 4447.18s]  on Twitch that time?
[4447.18s -> 4449.18s]  This is what this is.
[4449.18s -> 4451.18s]  And Google Assistant.
[4451.18s -> 4453.18s]  Just wait like five seconds before answering.
[4453.18s -> 4458.54s]  A child.
[4458.54s -> 4460.54s]  Now you're really screwing with me.
[4460.54s -> 4468.08s]  I know what I saw.
[4468.08s -> 4470.38s]  Let's just catch up with the others, okay?
[4470.38s -> 4472.56s]  Dude, it's right there.
[4472.56s -> 4482.41s]  What the fuck is that?
[4482.41s -> 4486.57s]  That was pretty gravy looking, I'm not gonna lie.
[4486.57s -> 4493.23s]  Did you hear that?
[4493.23s -> 4496.56s]  Okay, very good.
[4496.56s -> 4499.56s]  We're freaked.
[4499.56s -> 4501.56s]  That's an elaborate, we're freaked out.
[4501.56s -> 4503.56s]  Who's doing the joke? It's like I'm rustling bushes
[4503.56s -> 4505.56s]  shining lights, not like in $5,000 of makeup.
[4508.19s -> 4516.11s]  I got an idea.
[4516.11s -> 4518.11s]  You look one way, I'll look the other way.
[4518.11s -> 4520.11s]  Then nothing can sneak up on us.
[4520.11s -> 4522.11s]  Sounds good. Alright, I'll take the right side.
[4522.11s -> 4525.76s]  Alright, we have to stay close to each other.
[4525.76s -> 4537.40s]  Hey, wait for us.
[4537.40s -> 4539.40s]  That was a nice elaborate dance.
[4539.40s -> 4542.54s]  Alright, definitely start walking the other direction
[4542.54s -> 4545.10s]  instead and just go that way.
[4545.10s -> 4551.44s]  See how far we can go.
[4551.44s -> 4553.44s]  It sounds like a Mario Kart wrong way thing
[4553.44s -> 4555.44s]  starts blinking up there.
[4555.44s -> 4557.44s]  It's probably just a deer, this is deer crossing.
[4557.44s -> 4563.39s]  We can actually go pretty far.
[4563.39s -> 4565.82s]  It's probably
[4565.82s -> 4567.82s]  gonna loop us around.
[4567.82s -> 4569.82s]  It might.
[4569.82s -> 4577.80s]  Perfect.
[4577.80s -> 4580.11s]  Oh no!
[4580.11s -> 4582.11s]  Hang on, stay close, where are you?
[4582.11s -> 4584.11s]  Stay close, where'd you go?
[4584.11s -> 4586.80s]  Oh god, I already lost you.
[4586.80s -> 4588.80s]  I stood still, you walked forward
[4588.80s -> 4590.80s]  then backward.
[4590.80s -> 4597.56s]  No, I'm coming back the other way.
[4597.56s -> 4599.56s]  It's game over.
[4599.56s -> 4606.59s]  Do not go into that real thick stuff.
[4606.59s -> 4608.59s]  Wait, could you see me the whole time?
[4608.59s -> 4617.61s]  No, I just walked by you.
[4617.61s -> 4619.61s]  Hey, don't, stay together.
[4619.61s -> 4621.61s]  Is this just like a horror version of PUBG?
[4621.61s -> 4624.04s]  Is that the veil
[4624.04s -> 4626.04s]  chasing us into the zone?
[4626.04s -> 4628.04s]  I don't think we're physically allowed to go any further.
[4628.04s -> 4630.04s]  I think that actually might be what's happening.
[4630.04s -> 4635.66s]  What is that?
[4635.66s -> 4639.48s]  Something on the ground. Alright, you wanna pick it up?
[4639.48s -> 4642.49s]  You want me to pick it up, you pick it up.
[4642.49s -> 4644.49s]  You probably haven't even looked at one piece of lore the entire game.
[4644.49s -> 4646.49s]  You're right, I haven't looked at one single item
[4646.49s -> 4648.49s]  pretty much the whole game, you're right.
[4648.49s -> 4650.86s]  I picked up a newspaper and it was upside down
[4650.86s -> 4653.93s]  and then we got pulled out of here.
[4653.93s -> 4661.98s]  A clue.
[4661.98s -> 4663.98s]  They were trying to make a campfire and then went into the woods
[4663.98s -> 4668.96s]  to get some sticks.
[4668.96s -> 4670.96s]  Alright, take the pin out and stab it right in the brain
[4670.96s -> 4672.96s]  as hard as you can.
[4672.96s -> 4674.96s]  Just immediately, oh, it's a voodoo doll.
[4674.96s -> 4676.96s]  Let's try it.
[4676.96s -> 4682.08s]  Oh, whoa.
[4682.08s -> 4686.24s]  What is your name, sir?
[4686.24s -> 4691.29s]  Andrew.
[4691.29s -> 4698.96s]  Andrew?
[4698.96s -> 4701.13s]  My real name's Andrew but my friends call me Jerma.
[4701.13s -> 4703.69s]  What's your name?
[4714.25s -> 4716.25s]  Oh, it's Mary.
[4726.57s -> 4728.57s]  What are we playing?
[4728.57s -> 4730.57s]  What are we playing?
[4734.57s -> 4736.57s]  Oh, wait, wasn't dancing considered
[4736.57s -> 4738.57s]  witchcraft back in the fucking 1400s?
[4759.64s -> 4762.52s]  I don't. I do.
[4762.52s -> 4764.52s]  I mean, I have like three or four theories.
[4769.26s -> 4771.26s]  How can you not have seen that?
[4771.26s -> 4773.26s]  I couldn't see anything through this
[4773.26s -> 4775.26s]  impossible, impenetrable fog.
[4775.26s -> 4777.63s]  Well, go ahead. Tell them what we saw.
[4777.63s -> 4784.48s]  A little girl
[4784.48s -> 4786.48s]  appeared out of the fog and then just like
[4786.48s -> 4789.04s]  that, she was gone again.
[4789.04s -> 4791.04s]  What is going on?
[4791.04s -> 4793.34s]  Maybe the fog has got you confused.
[4793.34s -> 4795.34s]  We're all stressed out.
[4795.34s -> 4797.34s]  We all agree
[4797.34s -> 4799.34s]  that the road is an infinite loop.
[4799.34s -> 4801.34s]  Anything is possible.
[4801.34s -> 4803.34s]  Looked exactly like the girl in my dream.
[4803.34s -> 4806.60s]  Something's.
[4812.91s -> 4814.91s]  Yes, it was, right?
[4831.15s -> 4833.39s]  Maybe.
[4842.16s -> 4844.16s]  Did she stab me?
[4844.16s -> 4846.16s]  She stabbed me. She stabbed me with a knife in the arm
[4846.16s -> 4848.16s]  and a little doll arm.
[4848.16s -> 4850.16s]  Yeah, that's what happened.
[4852.97s -> 4854.97s]  Get that doll away from her and throw it in the fucking fire.
[4856.97s -> 4858.97s]  But wait until it's on a different person
[4858.97s -> 4863.58s]  than me.
[4863.58s -> 4865.76s]  Is there a doll for everybody?
[4871.76s -> 4873.76s]  I'm just going to take that doll and I'm going to
[4873.76s -> 4875.76s]  go rent out a warehouse and I'm going to get a little box
[4875.76s -> 4877.76s]  in that warehouse and I'm going to have inside
[4877.76s -> 4879.76s]  the box is going to be perfect.
[4879.76s -> 4881.76s]  75 degrees, zero humidity.
[4881.76s -> 4884.44s]  Leave it in there.
[4884.44s -> 4886.44s]  Buy the doll a mansion
[4886.44s -> 4888.44s]  in like a little RC car, like a really
[4888.44s -> 4890.44s]  cute one. Do you get all that shit in real life?
[4890.44s -> 4892.44s]  Oh wait, wait, wait, update.
[4892.44s -> 4896.16s]  Everything that one does
[4896.16s -> 4898.16s]  or doesn't do in one's life
[4898.16s -> 4900.16s]  will catch up with one
[4900.16s -> 4903.10s]  adventure. Don't you think?
[4903.10s -> 4907.12s]  Don't look at me. I
[4907.12s -> 4909.36s]  can't help you. Remember?
[4913.26s -> 4915.26s]  We sometimes congratulate
[4915.26s -> 4917.26s]  ourselves on waking from
[4917.26s -> 4919.26s]  a troubled dream.
[4919.26s -> 4921.26s]  Maybe so the moment
[4921.26s -> 4923.26s]  after death.
[4923.26s -> 4929.21s]  My travels over many years.
[4929.21s -> 4931.21s]  I've witnessed many things.
[4931.21s -> 4933.21s]  Seen and heard many beliefs.
[4933.21s -> 4935.21s]  And there's usually some
[4935.21s -> 4937.21s]  element of truth
[4937.21s -> 4939.21s]  in each of them.
[4939.21s -> 4942.22s]  He's to get rid of walls. His roommate's fucking
[4942.22s -> 4944.22s]  annoying. These unfortunate folks seem to be dealing with forces
[4944.22s -> 4946.22s]  as yet unexplained.
[4946.22s -> 4948.22s]  I mean sinister
[4948.22s -> 4950.22s]  movements in the forest. Spirits
[4950.22s -> 4952.22s]  from the past. A little girl
[4952.22s -> 4954.22s]  who may be in trouble
[4954.22s -> 4958.06s]  or maybe she simply
[4958.06s -> 4960.30s]  is trouble. See, I said
[4960.30s -> 4962.30s]  that she was malicious. That was right. Anyway, where are
[4962.30s -> 4965.18s]  we? Angela isn't getting
[4965.18s -> 4967.18s]  much tittle tattle
[4967.18s -> 4969.18s]  out of Taylor. Tittle
[4969.18s -> 4971.18s]  tattle. No kiss
[4971.18s -> 4973.61s]  and tell. What about
[4973.61s -> 4975.79s]  John, the figure of
[4975.79s -> 4977.79s]  authority perhaps? No, he's a chump.
[4977.79s -> 4980.16s]  Or perhaps he represents
[4980.16s -> 4982.16s]  something else. He's a badass darts player though from what I could
[4982.16s -> 4984.84s]  see. And then there's Andrew.
[4984.84s -> 4986.84s]  Somewhat confused I think.
[4986.84s -> 4988.84s]  A bump to the head can do
[4988.84s -> 4990.84s]  that. Andrew is, you know. Let me reassure
[4990.84s -> 4992.84s]  you. Andrew's alright.
[4992.84s -> 4994.84s]  Who's Andrew?
[4994.84s -> 4997.28s]  Bandit snatch guy.
[4997.28s -> 4999.28s]  Oh, yeah. The main guy.
[4999.28s -> 5001.28s]  Yup.
[5003.45s -> 5005.45s]  Ooh, Omega Lowell.
[5019.53s -> 5021.53s]  Okay, that's pretty good.
[5021.53s -> 5023.53s]  Somebody in chat said, this is just
[5023.53s -> 5025.53s]  an annoying DM trying to hype
[5025.53s -> 5027.53s]  up his players before they get back
[5027.53s -> 5029.53s]  in the game. That's
[5029.53s -> 5031.53s]  fucking upvote
[5031.53s -> 5033.53s]  that guy with all your points.
[5038.35s -> 5040.35s]  Super into it DM
[5040.35s -> 5042.35s]  hyping his players up.
[5042.35s -> 5044.35s]  Whoever that guy was, I want that guy
[5044.35s -> 5047.42s]  VIP'd for five minutes.
[5047.42s -> 5049.42s]  You're John now.
[5049.42s -> 5051.42s]  Yeah, we keep switching.
[5055.42s -> 5058.43s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[5060.43s -> 5062.43s]  Am I supposed to stay close to you or find help in town?
[5062.43s -> 5064.43s]  Are we splitting up or are we staying together?
[5064.43s -> 5066.43s]  I don't know. Maybe, should we tell?
[5066.43s -> 5068.43s]  Are you following me? I'm the
[5068.43s -> 5070.43s]  old lady again. Yeah, it just says
[5070.43s -> 5072.73s]  keep up with the others. I'm
[5072.73s -> 5077.79s]  the professor. Are we gonna go knock
[5077.79s -> 5079.79s]  on this random house? I'm just trying to keep everybody
[5079.79s -> 5083.37s]  in my field of view in case they disappear.
[5083.37s -> 5085.37s]  Or, you know, the game could just rip me on the other side.
[5085.37s -> 5089.53s]  I'm using my phone
[5089.53s -> 5091.53s]  as a flashlight, but I have not
[5091.53s -> 5093.53s]  attempted to call anybody in the game
[5093.53s -> 5096.54s]  yet. That shit drains your battery. There's something over
[5096.54s -> 5099.29s]  here. Why don't you pick it up?
[5099.29s -> 5110.17s]  Yeah, I'll pick it up. I
[5110.17s -> 5112.48s]  accidentally put it back down without
[5112.48s -> 5114.48s]  looking at it. I was trying to take it out
[5114.48s -> 5118.57s]  of your hand. Okay, so that's just
[5118.57s -> 5120.57s]  nothing. Why are we all over here? It's a picture
[5120.57s -> 5122.57s]  of a skull.
[5122.57s -> 5124.57s]  Ooh, a picture of a skull.
[5124.57s -> 5127.13s]  I'm getting a premonition.
[5127.13s -> 5133.72s]  I think we lost. No, they're just
[5133.72s -> 5136.99s]  standing here. It's just a very morbid
[5136.99s -> 5146.46s]  postcard.
[5146.46s -> 5148.46s]  I heard something, I heard something.
[5151.92s -> 5155.63s]  Okay, that's an alligator.
[5155.63s -> 5158.76s]  Oh, alligator POV, alligator POV.
[5158.76s -> 5160.76s]  Look. Alright, come over here. This is definitely alligator POV.
[5160.76s -> 5163.58s]  He's watching us or something.
[5163.58s -> 5172.01s]  Aww. He's standing up on
[5172.01s -> 5185.26s]  two legs. POV,
[5185.26s -> 5187.26s]  you are the alligator.
[5187.26s -> 5191.16s]  Are we all together, right? We're good?
[5191.16s -> 5193.16s]  Yeah, we're all here.
[5193.16s -> 5195.16s]  Oh, it was just an animal.
[5195.16s -> 5197.16s]  I told you it was a deer crossing.
[5197.16s -> 5200.73s]  It's just a deer.
[5200.73s -> 5204.89s]  Might get a better view from up there.
[5204.89s -> 5218.12s]  Don't go alone.
[5218.12s -> 5221.18s]  Trinkets. What's this trinket?
[5221.18s -> 5223.74s]  Ghost towns of the northeast.
[5223.74s -> 5226.88s]  I'm not reading this.
[5226.88s -> 5228.88s]  This is fucking too long. I don't care.
[5228.88s -> 5230.88s]  Is that you or your character that said who writes
[5230.88s -> 5232.88s]  this trash? I think we both just said it at the same time.
[5232.88s -> 5239.92s]  Okay,
[5239.92s -> 5241.92s]  for all future game developers, let me just
[5241.92s -> 5243.92s]  tell you, if it's longer than a paragraph,
[5243.92s -> 5248.27s]  I'm not reading it.
[5248.27s -> 5253.71s]  Go right in the middle
[5253.71s -> 5255.71s]  of both of them. Like, as
[5255.71s -> 5257.71s]  close to the middle as you can. Wait, what?
[5257.71s -> 5259.71s]  I'm just sitting here, like, mouth breathing on you guys
[5259.71s -> 5261.71s]  having a conversation.
[5261.71s -> 5263.71s]  Yeah, but like, try and position yourself
[5263.71s -> 5265.71s]  right between them. Or directly
[5265.71s -> 5267.71s]  behind me. I can't even move.
[5267.71s -> 5269.71s]  What's up?
[5269.71s -> 5271.71s]  You two okay? After what we went through
[5271.71s -> 5273.71s]  back there, we're both a considerable
[5273.71s -> 5280.75s]  distance from okay.
[5280.75s -> 5282.75s]  Sorry I lost touch with you in the fog.
[5282.75s -> 5285.63s]  It shows we need to stick close to
[5285.63s -> 5288.76s]  each other.
[5288.76s -> 5290.76s]  Let's not turn this into an argument.
[5290.76s -> 5292.76s]  Why do you sound like you're in on it?
[5292.76s -> 5295.39s]  This game is ridiculous.
[5295.39s -> 5298.65s]  It just sounds like we need
[5298.65s -> 5300.65s]  to stick close to each other.
[5300.65s -> 5303.72s]  Oh,
[5303.72s -> 5305.72s]  swamp monster.
[5305.72s -> 5310.65s]  Wait,
[5310.65s -> 5313.47s]  did we see that?
[5313.47s -> 5315.47s]  No, we're the only ones who can see
[5315.47s -> 5317.64s]  anything, apparently.
[5317.64s -> 5320.14s]  The only thing that they've seen
[5320.14s -> 5322.14s]  so far is the fire
[5322.14s -> 5324.14s]  and the little girl with the dolls.
[5324.14s -> 5326.96s]  We've seen all the monsters.
[5326.96s -> 5331.24s]  Trixie hoppetses.
[5331.24s -> 5333.24s]  Yes, yes, yes.
[5333.24s -> 5335.80s]  We want it.
[5335.80s -> 5337.80s]  Oh, precious.
[5337.80s -> 5351.56s]  This is four golems.
[5351.56s -> 5353.56s]  Yeah, you just got a double impression.
[5353.56s -> 5359.39s]  That was a two for one.
[5359.39s -> 5364.12s]  Are we going the wrong way?
[5364.12s -> 5366.12s]  Every way is the wrong way in this game.
[5366.12s -> 5369.64s]  Why are you not last hitting?
[5369.64s -> 5371.64s]  Because fuck last hitting. It's a stupid mechanic.
[5371.64s -> 5373.64s]  It turns me off of every one of those games.
[5373.64s -> 5375.64s]  Smite's the only one that didn't have it.
[5375.64s -> 5378.84s]  It's the only one that was any fun.
[5378.84s -> 5384.73s]  True. Alligator.
[5384.73s -> 5386.73s]  No, no, no, look, look, look. Do you see?
[5386.73s -> 5388.73s]  I see it, yeah. It's someone's ear.
[5388.73s -> 5394.88s]  Heroes of the Storm. Heroes of the Storm was alright.
[5394.88s -> 5398.91s]  It was too, Heroes of the Storm
[5398.91s -> 5400.91s]  was too easy for me, though.
[5400.91s -> 5402.91s]  And no, not like, oh, too easy, but like
[5402.91s -> 5404.91s]  I like having at least some
[5404.91s -> 5406.91s]  individuality in those games.
[5406.91s -> 5408.91s]  I have you to share everything in Heroes of the Storm.
[5408.91s -> 5410.91s]  I don't want to share everything. I want it from me.
[5410.91s -> 5412.91s]  I want to get like the boots of fucking justice and shit on my own.
[5412.91s -> 5417.58s]  Is this the newest Strand
[5417.58s -> 5419.58s]  type video game? Are we like delivering
[5419.58s -> 5421.58s]  a package or what? Walking?
[5421.58s -> 5423.58s]  I don't know. You're the one that played that game.
[5423.58s -> 5430.28s]  Hey, something up ahead.
[5430.28s -> 5433.87s]  Little Hope Middle School.
[5433.87s -> 5440.08s]  Uh oh. I don't like last hitting.
[5440.08s -> 5442.08s]  I don't know.
[5442.08s -> 5444.08s]  Guess we've been demoted from college, guys.
[5444.08s -> 5447.98s]  Amen to that.
[5447.98s -> 5449.98s]  He's going to go teach the middle schoolers.
[5449.98s -> 5454.14s]  Look at that.
[5454.14s -> 5456.75s]  Hey, wait.
[5456.75s -> 5462.25s]  Stop. It worked.
[5462.25s -> 5464.25s]  Did you listen? Yeah.
[5464.25s -> 5466.25s]  This is exactly what goes down in horror movies.
[5466.25s -> 5469.77s]  Self-referential.
[5469.77s -> 5471.77s]  I'll give it to you. What the hell do we do now?
[5471.77s -> 5474.59s]  It's just a little girl. What?
[5474.59s -> 5477.28s]  What the hell do we do?
[5477.28s -> 5479.28s]  She's two feet tall and has no
[5479.28s -> 5481.28s]  muscle structure. We can kill her.
[5481.28s -> 5483.28s]  What are you talking about? So bad they finally made
[5483.28s -> 5488.78s]  fear for. Uh.
[5488.78s -> 5492.17s]  Uh.
[5492.17s -> 5494.99s]  I'll deal with this. What?
[5494.99s -> 5496.99s]  Stay right here. Really?
[5496.99s -> 5498.99s]  Time to mute and I'll see you
[5498.99s -> 5500.99s]  for the next chapter.
[5500.99s -> 5504.96s]  Handle this.
[5504.96s -> 5506.96s]  Hey, remember when we took bets on who would die
[5506.96s -> 5508.96s]  first? I think you're just trying to confirm
[5508.96s -> 5510.96s]  that you were right.
[5510.96s -> 5512.96s]  I'm just stacking the deck. You're throwing for that guy.
[5512.96s -> 5514.96s]  Stacking the deck. What are you doing?
[5514.96s -> 5516.96s]  Hold up. I'll come with you.
[5516.96s -> 5518.96s]  No, don't kill her. I like her.
[5518.96s -> 5522.80s]  We're killing this guy. Listen, you've got to live with your
[5522.80s -> 5524.80s]  consequences. I'm not going to be left behind
[5524.80s -> 5526.80s]  as a secondary character back here while you go do all the heroic stuff.
[5526.80s -> 5528.80s]  No, no, great.
[5528.80s -> 5531.87s]  Hey, you two.
[5531.87s -> 5533.87s]  We just bachelorette picked
[5533.87s -> 5535.87s]  these two people to die.
[5535.87s -> 5538.11s]  This is not good.
[5538.11s -> 5542.46s]  Confront the girl. Great. Alright, you go
[5542.46s -> 5544.46s]  first. No, I go first. I want the old lady to live.
[5544.46s -> 5551.16s]  You're the one
[5551.16s -> 5553.16s]  that decided to go follow them.
[5553.16s -> 5555.16s]  I'm not going to let you pass me. This is NASCAR level
[5555.16s -> 5557.16s]  shit here. I'm just going to, you're not going to get.
[5557.16s -> 5559.47s]  Okay, I get the drift.
[5559.47s -> 5579.85s]  Nightcrawler?
[5579.85s -> 5581.85s]  What is it you want from me?
[5581.85s -> 5587.48s]  Are you? What are you doing here?
[5587.48s -> 5590.56s]  These are most troubling times.
[5590.56s -> 5592.99s]  Wait, don't go.
[5592.99s -> 5594.99s]  Stay away.
[5594.99s -> 5599.60s]  What? You're the one that
[5599.60s -> 5608.81s]  grabbed us first?
[5608.81s -> 5611.76s]  It's impossible. It's her.
[5611.76s -> 5613.76s]  A black tongue full of riddles. I will not
[5613.76s -> 5615.76s]  succumb to a witch's spell.
[5615.76s -> 5618.57s]  It's her. It's you.
[5618.57s -> 5620.57s]  Please Lord, I beg you. Rid me of these
[5620.57s -> 5622.57s]  apparitions. Oh, we're like in
[5622.57s -> 5624.57s]  each other's worlds. We're like the ghosts
[5624.57s -> 5626.57s]  in their world and they're the ghosts in our world.
[5626.57s -> 5629.07s]  Fuck.
[5629.07s -> 5631.07s]  That's what I was going to say when you said don't say your theories out loud.
[5631.07s -> 5633.07s]  Where the hell are we?
[5633.07s -> 5635.07s]  You just took credit. What have you done?
[5635.07s -> 5637.07s]  I have had my fill of you.
[5637.07s -> 5639.07s]  You just wanted to get in first.
[5639.07s -> 5641.07s]  Yeah, you didn't say that. You couldn't jump in and
[5641.07s -> 5646.89s]  said that.
[5646.89s -> 5649.77s]  Stolen.
[5649.77s -> 5652.27s]  Let's get into town. It's not so far now.
[5652.27s -> 5654.27s]  And it's our best shot at getting help.
[5654.27s -> 5656.27s]  That's a great theory.
[5656.27s -> 5659.40s]  Thanks, man.
[5659.40s -> 5661.40s]  I am very far from okay.
[5661.40s -> 5663.40s]  I'm tired and confused. I just saw my own
[5663.40s -> 5665.58s]  double in the fog.
[5665.58s -> 5667.58s]  What happened in there?
[5667.58s -> 5669.58s]  The woman came out of nowhere in the fog, dressed like an extra
[5669.58s -> 5671.58s]  from Salem. She was garbling something
[5671.58s -> 5673.58s]  in an accent I didn't recognize. And most disturbing
[5673.58s -> 5675.58s]  of all, she was the spitting
[5675.58s -> 5677.58s]  image of me.
[5677.58s -> 5679.58s]  How is that even possible? You're blowing this
[5679.58s -> 5681.58s]  out of proportion, Angela.
[5681.58s -> 5683.58s]  I am all done. Alright, I'm ready to kill that guy.
[5683.58s -> 5685.58s]  Kill this guy. Kill this guy. Can we just all agree?
[5685.58s -> 5687.58s]  Except into the center of town.
[5687.58s -> 5689.58s]  The fog decides where we can and can't go?
[5689.58s -> 5691.58s]  Fuck that.
[5691.58s -> 5693.58s]  He was in the dream and he still thinks I'm
[5693.58s -> 5696.52s]  overreacting.
[5696.52s -> 5698.52s]  Oh, no. Here comes the quintessential
[5698.52s -> 5701.20s]  decision. Okay.
[5701.20s -> 5707.08s]  Well. Don't you kids watch horror movies?
[5707.08s -> 5709.08s]  You never, ever split up.
[5709.08s -> 5711.90s]  Those movies are dumb.
[5711.90s -> 5713.90s]  Those movies are dumb.
[5713.90s -> 5715.90s]  Wait, didn't she just say this is the shit that happens
[5715.90s -> 5717.90s]  in horror movies? Those are dumb.
[5717.90s -> 5727.63s]  Don't believe them. I'm with John.
[5727.63s -> 5729.63s]  Um. Isn't there another person
[5729.63s -> 5732.19s]  that we're missing here? I'm not going with Taylor.
[5732.19s -> 5734.19s]  The town isn't so far.
[5734.19s -> 5736.19s]  We all go in together.
[5736.19s -> 5738.19s]  Okay, time out.
[5738.19s -> 5740.68s]  Can we all just take a breath?
[5740.68s -> 5742.86s]  Think about what our next move is?
[5742.86s -> 5745.68s]  We can check out more options if we split up.
[5745.68s -> 5747.85s]  I'll go with Taylor. It's not safe for you to be hanging
[5747.85s -> 5749.85s]  around here on your own. Oh, where's the third player?
[5749.85s -> 5751.85s]  Two teams are more likely to find a way out.
[5751.85s -> 5754.54s]  Which is what we all want, right?
[5754.54s -> 5756.54s]  Didn't we just agree not to split up?
[5756.54s -> 5758.54s]  We did.
[5758.54s -> 5760.54s]  Send them into town
[5760.54s -> 5766.43s]  to find us.
[5766.43s -> 5768.43s]  It's just like horror movies. Horror movies are dumb.
[5768.43s -> 5770.43s]  Alright, see you in an hour, it's Alex.
[5770.43s -> 5772.99s]  Do you like ghost
[5772.99s -> 5774.99s]  stories, Ms. Turner?
[5774.99s -> 5776.99s]  See you in an hour. You're in one.
[5776.99s -> 5780.44s]  And his face turns into a fucking ghost.
[5780.44s -> 5788.38s]  Alright, hey, see you in an hour
[5788.38s -> 5790.38s]  when, um, like two of your
[5790.38s -> 5792.38s]  characters are dead and all of mine are.
[5792.38s -> 5794.38s]  Hey, who are you? I don't intend on
[5794.38s -> 5796.38s]  splitting up. I think we split up. I'm, um,
[5796.38s -> 5798.38s]  I'm the, I don't want to say it, but
[5798.38s -> 5800.38s]  I'm the guy with the other
[5800.38s -> 5802.38s]  I'm the guy that like, we don't
[5802.38s -> 5804.38s]  Yeah, the guy that like, who cares, right? Like
[5804.38s -> 5806.38s]  I'm not connected with Daniel at all.
[5806.38s -> 5808.38s]  I don't know about you, but I have it at all.
[5808.38s -> 5810.38s]  I was Daniel first.
[5810.38s -> 5812.38s]  So you're doing something else.
[5812.38s -> 5814.94s]  But he has no personality as of yet.
[5814.94s -> 5817.95s]  Alright, so I'll see you in a little bit.
[5817.95s -> 5819.95s]  Alright, we're split up.
[5819.95s -> 5824.56s]  I wonder what closed the school down.
[5824.56s -> 5827.95s]  I thought it was just us two.
[5827.95s -> 5829.95s]  Even if you make it over, there's no way I'm
[5829.95s -> 5833.08s]  following. I never did like school.
[5833.08s -> 5836.33s]  Let's get out of here. Looks like there's no way
[5836.33s -> 5839.08s]  through. I might have made a bad call here.
[5839.08s -> 5841.08s]  Your guy's personality that you gave
[5841.08s -> 5843.08s]  this guy is
[5843.08s -> 5847.42s]  This is not even Daniel to me.
[5847.42s -> 5849.79s]  Don't stress it. No one made us come this way.
[5849.79s -> 5855.92s]  We'll find another way.
[5855.92s -> 5865.12s]  Okay, reassuring. Let's go.
[5865.12s -> 5867.74s]  Damn, Daniel.
[5867.74s -> 5871.13s]  Find another route out of
[5871.13s -> 5873.13s]  little hope. Stick together,
[5873.13s -> 5877.04s]  follow the little girl.
[5877.04s -> 5880.88s]  Okay, we have to follow the little girl.
[5880.88s -> 5882.88s]  I just read that in chat.
[5882.88s -> 5884.88s]  I forgot that that was even a thing.
[5884.88s -> 5887.63s]  Somebody said it and I read it.
[5887.63s -> 5889.63s]  Remember, I'm the streamer that reads
[5889.63s -> 5891.63s]  his chat out loud. It doesn't matter
[5891.63s -> 5898.35s]  what it is. Find another route.
[5898.35s -> 5900.35s]  Search for the little girl.
[5904.35s -> 5906.35s]  Don't read this.
[5906.35s -> 5908.35s]  I talked about shoving smarties
[5908.35s -> 5910.97s]  somewhere recently.
[5910.97s -> 5913.60s]  I wouldn't say that in a normal circumstance.
[5913.60s -> 5916.73s]  Alright, follow the little girl.
[5916.73s -> 5924.60s]  There she is.
[5924.60s -> 5929.64s]  You into the tube.
[5929.64s -> 5935.15s]  Concerned?
[5938.35s -> 5940.35s]  Something is real off about this whole thing.
[5940.35s -> 5943.36s]  This
[5943.36s -> 5945.36s]  This little girl is the key
[5945.36s -> 5947.36s]  to all of this. I have no clue.
[5947.36s -> 5950.30s]  Wow, you can't be doing that.
[5950.30s -> 5956.51s]  Did I reach?
[5956.51s -> 5958.51s]  I guess I'm gay.
[5958.51s -> 5960.51s]  What the hell is going on?
[5960.51s -> 5969.07s]  That didn't just happen. Quiet now.
[5969.07s -> 5971.07s]  What are you talking about? Get where
[5971.07s -> 5973.07s]  or he will find me.
[5973.07s -> 5975.82s]  Who the fuck is this?
[5975.82s -> 5981.31s]  Come on out, Mary. I know very
[5981.31s -> 5983.31s]  well you're in there. That's not
[5983.31s -> 5985.31s]  me.
[5985.31s -> 5988.06s]  What the fuck
[5988.06s -> 5990.06s]  it kind of is.
[6003.68s -> 6007.90s]  Let go.
[6007.90s -> 6010.08s]  I broke the time.
[6010.08s -> 6012.57s]  I broke time?
[6012.57s -> 6014.57s]  What?
[6021.13s -> 6023.76s]  I saw her in the forest
[6023.76s -> 6025.76s]  together with her familiars.
[6025.76s -> 6027.76s]  I am innocent. He can't see me.
[6027.76s -> 6029.76s]  I will have the truth one way or another.
[6029.76s -> 6031.76s]  You come with
[6031.76s -> 6034.00s]  me, girl. Thank you kindly.
[6034.00s -> 6036.00s]  Be silent, child.
[6036.00s -> 6038.00s]  Don't say that. That means I have to do everything you say.
[6038.00s -> 6044.14s]  Can someone tell me what just happened?
[6044.14s -> 6046.70s]  Those two kids have to be linked
[6046.70s -> 6048.70s]  somehow. No way that's a
[6048.70s -> 6052.03s]  coincidence. I don't get it.
[6052.03s -> 6055.10s]  Let's not hang around here. It's time
[6055.10s -> 6057.10s]  to go. Alright, yeah, so we're
[6057.10s -> 6059.10s]  only little girl can see us.
[6059.10s -> 6061.47s]  Only the other devil worshippers
[6061.47s -> 6063.47s]  can see us. I got that wrong probably, but whatever.
[6063.47s -> 6078.56s]  Let's go.
[6078.56s -> 6080.56s]  I'm glad you're here. Both of us are getting out of here.
[6080.56s -> 6082.73s]  I see it in the distance.
[6082.73s -> 6088.04s]  This is literally just
[6088.04s -> 6098.09s]  the crucible. Could mean someone's around.
[6098.09s -> 6100.46s]  Maybe they can help.
[6100.46s -> 6102.89s]  Let's head over. Blowing
[6102.89s -> 6104.89s]  past the lore. I'm sorry.
[6104.89s -> 6106.89s]  I don't read lore.
[6106.89s -> 6108.89s]  I don't read lore.
[6108.89s -> 6110.89s]  Okay, I got it. I wasn't looking. I got it.
[6110.89s -> 6114.48s]  No, I read lore
[6114.48s -> 6116.48s]  if it's a paragraph and put on the screen
[6116.48s -> 6118.48s]  in front of me. I don't pick up newspapers
[6118.48s -> 6120.48s]  and read it. Don't worry, italics reads
[6120.48s -> 6129.69s]  all that shit. He'll tell us.
[6129.69s -> 6131.69s]  I don't think this takes us out of this shitty town.
[6131.69s -> 6136.09s]  There's no road.
[6136.09s -> 6138.59s]  Must lead somewhere though.
[6138.59s -> 6140.59s]  I'm not so sure. There's barely even a path.
[6140.59s -> 6143.08s]  Just blowing by every item.
[6143.08s -> 6145.08s]  But I'm not though.
[6145.08s -> 6147.08s]  If it's shiny, I click it. See?
[6147.08s -> 6152.01s]  This must have been a grocery store or something.
[6152.01s -> 6154.01s]  Here. This is less than a paragraph.
[6154.01s -> 6159.90s]  Over here. Look at this.
[6159.90s -> 6163.61s]  The hope for
[6163.61s -> 6165.61s]  little hope. The carvers want to close
[6165.61s -> 6167.61s]  the factory
[6167.61s -> 6169.61s]  and sell the land of development.
[6169.61s -> 6171.79s]  That would result in the
[6171.79s -> 6173.79s]  devastation of the community.
[6173.79s -> 6175.79s]  The union has proposed an offer to save the factory
[6175.79s -> 6177.79s]  in our town. Please sign our petition to persuade
[6177.79s -> 6179.79s]  the carver. This is how I read lore anyways.
[6179.79s -> 6182.16s]  This is how I do it anyways.
[6196.68s -> 6199.68s]  Leave me alone.
[6199.68s -> 6206.44s]  How about we try the door?
[6206.44s -> 6208.44s]  Talek's already figured out how to upgrade his town hall
[6208.44s -> 6212.03s]  in the game.
[6212.03s -> 6214.03s]  Yeah, but what he doesn't know is I'm sending 200
[6214.03s -> 6216.20s]  peasants through the back door
[6216.20s -> 6218.20s]  to start attacking his town hall.
[6218.20s -> 6220.20s]  And it's a stupid shitty thing to do, but that's what
[6220.20s -> 6224.16s]  I'm doing. What am I doing?
[6224.16s -> 6226.16s]  This is the slowest selfie I've ever taken.
[6226.16s -> 6232.36s]  Oh, what? I just got 20 community subs.
[6232.36s -> 6236.27s]  Unionize your workplace thanks for the 20
[6236.27s -> 6238.27s]  subs. That's a lot of money.
[6238.27s -> 6243.20s]  Thanks? Really? 20
[6243.20s -> 6248.94s]  subs.
[6248.94s -> 6251.24s]  You don't have any food in here.
[6251.24s -> 6253.24s]  I'm surprised at what people throw away these days.
[6253.24s -> 6257.72s]  Seriously? There's no other way.
[6257.72s -> 6266.41s]  I've got no choice.
[6266.41s -> 6275.63s]  Isn't this on wheels? Why would it be this heavy?
[6275.63s -> 6285.48s]  Let me see if I can get this open.
[6285.48s -> 6287.48s]  Okay, I saw everybody say, dude, things can be
[6287.48s -> 6289.48s]  heavy. What's up with that?
[6289.48s -> 6298.19s]  Why is that that heavy? Seriously?
[6298.19s -> 6301.58s]  You're going in there? If I go in first
[6301.58s -> 6303.58s]  I don't want to be the character that dies first.
[6303.58s -> 6306.72s]  Alright, you have any better ideas?
[6306.72s -> 6309.52s]  Do you have a better suggestion? Sure.
[6309.52s -> 6311.52s]  Don't go into an old, dark, creepy ass
[6311.52s -> 6315.87s]  building after the night we've had.
[6315.87s -> 6318.11s]  Alright, I'll be right back.
[6318.11s -> 6321.31s]  And then I never show up again.
[6323.31s -> 6326.00s]  He's talking to us.
[6326.00s -> 6328.67s]  This is some Dora the Explorer shit.
[6328.67s -> 6330.67s]  And remember, chat, if you see
[6330.67s -> 6332.67s]  anything weird, make sure you point it out for me
[6332.67s -> 6334.84s]  before I get scared.
[6334.84s -> 6344.43s]  Do you see anything scary in here?
[6344.43s -> 6346.43s]  There's like a fucking ghoul behind him
[6346.43s -> 6348.80s]  with like a pitchfork.
[6348.80s -> 6350.80s]  It's right there! It's right there!
[6350.80s -> 6353.10s]  You see something? What do you see?
[6353.10s -> 6355.10s]  It's a ghoul! It's a ghoul!
[6355.10s -> 6357.10s]  It's a ghoul! It's a ghoul!
[6357.10s -> 6365.74s]  And the fucking pitchfork goes through his chest.
[6365.74s -> 6370.22s]  Oh, this is great.
[6370.22s -> 6381.40s]  Go in.
[6381.40s -> 6387.10s]  Go in, dude.
[6387.10s -> 6391.64s]  Oh, here we go. Brownbeef249.
[6391.64s -> 6399.44s]  Pretty cool. Alright, so I have to let her in a different way.
[6399.44s -> 6403.47s]  What? Just happened?
[6403.47s -> 6405.47s]  I have no idea what just happened.
[6405.47s -> 6410.78s]  I like stepped on a nail.
[6416.97s -> 6426.24s]  Oh, don't worry. It's just us.
[6428.24s -> 6437.71s]  Scared me.
[6437.71s -> 6442.03s]  Why would that bring
[6442.03s -> 6444.52s]  the relationship down?
[6444.52s -> 6449.58s]  Oh, rats!
[6451.76s -> 6455.79s]  Kill her. Kill her first.
[6455.79s -> 6460.33s]  I changed my mind.
[6460.33s -> 6472.24s]  This is super creepy.
[6476.19s -> 6478.19s]  That's not her this time.
[6478.19s -> 6480.94s]  That's somebody else.
[6480.94s -> 6484.72s]  It's not going to be her.
[6484.72s -> 6487.02s]  It's going to be a scary ghoul.
[6487.02s -> 6489.45s]  Okay.
[6489.45s -> 6508.08s]  Okay. Get off me.
[6508.08s -> 6513.39s]  Get off me.
[6513.39s -> 6517.74s]  Wait, that's Angela?
[6543.77s -> 6545.77s]  Dude, this is such a mindfuck.
[6545.77s -> 6548.78s]  Leave or confront?
[6548.78s -> 6550.78s]  Leave or confront?
[6550.78s -> 6553.58s]  Um...
[6553.58s -> 6555.58s]  Talos found a secret. I gotta one up him.
[6555.58s -> 6559.68s]  Confront.
[6559.68s -> 6561.68s]  I gotta hide a secret.
[6571.15s -> 6573.15s]  Oh, shit.
[6573.15s -> 6575.15s]  What rumors? I don't know anything. What are you talking about? What's a witch?
[6581.15s -> 6583.58s]  Uh...
[6583.58s -> 6585.58s]  Okay, I saw a girl.
[6587.58s -> 6590.14s]  Uh...
[6590.14s -> 6593.47s]  She was with this priest.
[6600.48s -> 6602.48s]  He's the devil.
[6613.88s -> 6615.88s]  He's got another secret.
[6615.88s -> 6617.88s]  I gotta start strangling somebody.
[6633.26s -> 6635.76s]  Finding all these secrets.
[6637.76s -> 6640.96s]  Alright, I'll kick his ass.
[6640.96s -> 6645.88s]  They didn't have guns back in the day here.
[6645.88s -> 6647.88s]  Just pick up a bottle and hit him in the head.
[6654.78s -> 6656.78s]  They did?
[6656.78s -> 6658.78s]  Yeah, but you could only shoot once in like an hour.
[6658.78s -> 6660.78s]  He'll miss. Stodge it.
[6660.78s -> 6662.78s]  And hit him in the head with a fucking wrench.
[6662.78s -> 6664.78s]  The child condemns my wife.
[6664.78s -> 6666.78s]  You will deliver yourself into the
[6666.78s -> 6668.78s]  marshal's hands for your own good.
[6668.78s -> 6670.78s]  Then I must accompany her.
[6670.78s -> 6672.78s]  She will not leave my sight.
[6672.78s -> 6674.78s]  Such action will not aid
[6674.78s -> 6676.78s]  your wife's cause.
[6676.78s -> 6678.78s]  Trust injustice.
[6678.78s -> 6681.02s]  Do not fear. I will find
[6681.02s -> 6683.02s]  a way to resolve this.
[6683.02s -> 6685.96s]  Am I still here? Oh.
[6685.96s -> 6694.28s]  How come they didn't ask me anything about like
[6694.28s -> 6696.28s]  my clothes and stuff?
[6696.28s -> 6698.28s]  Wouldn't they be freaked out by my clothes?
[6698.28s -> 6710.04s]  Where the hell have you been?
[6710.04s -> 6712.04s]  It's been weeks.
[6712.04s -> 6714.35s]  You look freaked. What's up?
[6714.35s -> 6725.80s]  You saw something else, right?
[6725.80s -> 6727.80s]  Uh, hmm.
[6727.80s -> 6729.80s]  Alright, they could, let's tell the truth.
[6729.80s -> 6732.49s]  This was different. I think they could see and hear me.
[6732.49s -> 6736.52s]  It was hard to tell exactly.
[6736.52s -> 6738.52s]  They seemed really spooked.
[6738.52s -> 6740.89s]  You see anything else?
[6740.89s -> 6743.20s]  Uh, okay.
[6743.20s -> 6745.20s]  Talk about the woman getting arrested, that's important.
[6745.20s -> 6748.40s]  Everyone needs to know that detail.
[6748.40s -> 6751.71s]  I saw this woman being taken away. Arrested.
[6751.71s -> 6753.71s]  She was being accused of witchcraft.
[6753.71s -> 6755.71s]  The spooky little girl,
[6755.71s -> 6757.71s]  she gave the name Amy to the priest.
[6757.71s -> 6759.71s]  That's what got the woman arrested.
[6759.71s -> 6761.71s]  The woman, Amy.
[6761.71s -> 6763.71s]  I guess she's in deep shit then.
[6763.71s -> 6766.96s]  Yes.
[6766.96s -> 6768.96s]  We've really screwed up here. Instead of getting out of this awful
[6768.96s -> 6770.96s]  place, we're right back in the middle of town.
[6770.96s -> 6775.82s]  Alright, catch up with the other group.
[6775.82s -> 6781.07s]  Can we just tell Italics that I killed like
[6781.07s -> 6783.69s]  eight people? Let's tell Italics
[6783.69s -> 6785.69s]  that my gameplay was fucking crazy.
[6785.69s -> 6796.19s]  Let's make him jealous
[6796.19s -> 6800.54s]  that he didn't get to play this part of the game.
[6800.54s -> 6802.54s]  Dude, I was in a fight.
[6802.54s -> 6805.55s]  There was two demons that had wings.
[6805.55s -> 6807.55s]  I was inside of this cabin that was on fire. I hit a guy in the head with a board.
[6807.55s -> 6812.03s]  I did a backflip.
[6812.03s -> 6814.03s]  The character just did a fucking backflip for no reason.
[6814.03s -> 6816.33s]  It was cool. Wait, did I?
[6816.33s -> 6818.33s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, where is she?
[6818.33s -> 6820.96s]  That face.
[6820.96s -> 6823.77s]  Okay, we're good.
[6823.77s -> 6831.07s]  We're fine. We're fine. What are you doing?
[6831.07s -> 6838.68s]  I just realized this is literally the movie
[6838.68s -> 6842.01s]  Hocus Pocus, isn't it?
[6842.01s -> 6852.22s]  You know, I don't, is it?
[6852.22s -> 6855.80s]  No, isn't Hocus Pocus, don't they like
[6855.80s -> 6861.42s]  hypnotize the town or something?
[6861.42s -> 6866.41s]  Like the candy or something?
[6866.41s -> 6868.41s]  What the fuck? Okay.
[6868.41s -> 6871.68s]  I just scared the shit out of me. I wasn't even looking.
[6871.68s -> 6873.68s]  It was like such an overreaction too. Sorry.
[6873.68s -> 6883.28s]  I like fucking YouTuber Andy that...
[6883.28s -> 6888.08s]  This is a gas station. Should we go to the gas station?
[6888.08s -> 6890.08s]  Stop saying Andy. I can't...
[6890.08s -> 6892.76s]  You guys have burned it into my brain.
[6892.76s -> 6911.37s]  Wait, we were already here. I have to catch up with the others.
[6911.37s -> 6913.37s]  How do I catch up with the others
[6913.37s -> 6922.33s]  if I don't know where the others are?
[6922.33s -> 6927.90s]  Italics got akimbo pistols, omega low.
[6927.90s -> 6929.90s]  Oh, hey, Italics is on knife, dude.
[6929.90s -> 6932.33s]  You're still on the third pistol.
[6932.33s -> 6934.83s]  Yeah, whatever. I don't fucking care.
[6934.83s -> 6940.65s]  Alright, I'm just gonna keep walking through the mist?
[6940.65s -> 6945.88s]  Wait, what's that? A button.
[6945.88s -> 6953.60s]  Press that button. Press the button.
[6953.60s -> 6961.21s]  Press it. I can't press this button?
[6961.21s -> 6974.36s]  Why not? No, go with the...
[6974.36s -> 6987.85s]  Damn it. I think I found it.
[6987.85s -> 6990.80s]  Hey, what was that? What was that?
[6990.80s -> 6993.55s]  I just walked by me. I...
[6993.55s -> 6995.55s]  This stupid smog shit. I'm trying to go to that house.
[6995.55s -> 7010.57s]  Where's that house?
[7010.57s -> 7012.57s]  Okay, I'm gonna go to that... I think that's where he is.
[7012.57s -> 7016.22s]  I think he's in the house. It's teleporting me around.
[7016.22s -> 7020.36s]  Alright, hold on. This is...
[7020.36s -> 7033.26s]  What am I doing?
[7033.26s -> 7040.43s]  What the fuck is going on? Am I in limbo?
[7040.43s -> 7044.65s]  Oh, alright.
[7044.65s -> 7048.62s]  We walk around. There's a house though.
[7048.62s -> 7056.09s]  Do I go back in the gas station?
[7056.09s -> 7058.09s]  No, I was already... No, this is not even...
[7058.09s -> 7063.79s]  Get the fuck out of here, man. Go catch up with the others.
[7063.79s -> 7066.09s]  I gotta go in this house.
[7066.09s -> 7070.36s]  Walk the other way, dickhead.
[7070.36s -> 7076.19s]  Is that... What's going on? Am I just
[7076.19s -> 7079.07s]  in the lobby, waiting for
[7079.07s -> 7091.53s]  Italics to do a cutscene?
[7091.53s -> 7093.71s]  Wrong way. There is no wrong way.
[7093.71s -> 7104.59s]  We keep porting. Alright, I'm walking straight.
[7104.59s -> 7111.82s]  I'm gonna go in that house.
[7111.82s -> 7115.21s]  Oh, in the gas station. You went every direction
[7115.21s -> 7117.21s]  except the right one. I tried to go to the house,
[7117.21s -> 7120.35s]  but the game teleported me. Remember, it's faking
[7120.35s -> 7123.68s]  tasks. He's sus. I'm not gonna
[7123.68s -> 7129.24s]  ban that person, but just pretend I did.
[7129.24s -> 7132.25s]  Alright, here we go. There's a house over here.
[7132.25s -> 7139.28s]  Just stay on the road. Where's that house?
[7139.28s -> 7141.52s]  Right here. This is what I... Okay.
[7141.52s -> 7143.88s]  Do you understand what... Do you see what just happened?
[7143.88s -> 7146.64s]  Do you see what just happened?
[7146.64s -> 7149.07s]  I just tried to go to the house
[7149.07s -> 7154.44s]  and it turned into the general store.
[7154.44s -> 7167.95s]  There is no house. There is? What?
[7167.95s -> 7170.49s]  That's where I wanted to go!
[7174.59s -> 7176.59s]  That's where I wanted to go! I was trying
[7176.59s -> 7178.59s]  to go here until you saw that.
[7191.76s -> 7193.76s]  German, don't be so mad. My mom is watching.
[7193.76s -> 7196.64s]  She's getting scared.
[7196.64s -> 7198.64s]  Hey.
[7198.64s -> 7201.44s]  Nice jump cut.
[7201.44s -> 7204.25s]  No, but you know how we say here.
[7204.25s -> 7206.25s]  Broccoli is delicious. You should eat it every meal.
[7206.25s -> 7208.25s]  Spinach. Get good grades
[7208.25s -> 7210.25s]  in school. And go to bed
[7210.25s -> 7212.25s]  before 9pm.
[7212.25s -> 7215.82s]  That's what we do here
[7215.82s -> 7219.02s]  on German 985.
[7219.02s -> 7230.28s]  Kid friendly. Is he not entering the door?
[7230.28s -> 7233.42s]  Or what?
[7240.94s -> 7242.94s]  Really?
[7242.94s -> 7244.94s]  Come on.
[7246.94s -> 7248.94s]  We can't open it. You can't open it.
[7248.94s -> 7253.52s]  Letting you in.
[7253.52s -> 7255.52s]  I was walking around in a circle for like 15 minutes.
[7255.52s -> 7258.27s]  Let's try again.
[7258.27s -> 7260.27s]  Put everything you've got into it.
[7260.27s -> 7262.27s]  No.
[7262.27s -> 7264.27s]  Keep them out. They're gonna result
[7264.27s -> 7266.27s]  untimely to mine.
[7266.27s -> 7268.27s]  Let me in.
[7268.27s -> 7270.27s]  That's worse than doing nothing. Get out of my way.
[7270.27s -> 7273.53s]  I'll show you.
[7273.53s -> 7275.53s]  Are you guys pushing? You guys have to pull
[7275.53s -> 7277.53s]  and we have to push. We both push.
[7277.53s -> 7279.53s]  Yeah, but I wasn't doing the QTE
[7279.53s -> 7281.53s]  so I just wanted to keep you out.
[7281.53s -> 7283.53s]  Fucking hell.
[7294.57s -> 7296.57s]  Thank god she's still alive.
[7298.57s -> 7300.57s]  Thank god you did. So did I.
[7302.88s -> 7305.18s]  Daniel looks dead.
[7305.18s -> 7307.18s]  I got info. You might have info.
[7314.04s -> 7317.05s]  What's gonna happen to her next?
[7317.05s -> 7319.23s]  I like the idea. But how would we even
[7319.23s -> 7324.03s]  begin to find that out?
[7324.03s -> 7326.03s]  We've already been down those paths.
[7326.03s -> 7328.03s]  Maybe the answer lies
[7328.03s -> 7330.03s]  down the one path we haven't taken yet.
[7330.03s -> 7332.03s]  Any direction we go, the lore ghosts will find us.
[7332.03s -> 7334.03s]  What the hell?
[7334.03s -> 7336.03s]  They just reach out and grab you when it's time for the lore.
[7336.03s -> 7338.03s]  By the way, this is one of those dumb horror movies that
[7338.03s -> 7340.27s]  Honey, it's 7pm. It's time for your
[7340.27s -> 7343.60s]  lore.
[7343.60s -> 7347.05s]  Is that a
[7347.05s -> 7349.05s]  This is gonna be
[7349.05s -> 7351.05s]  one of those horror movies where everybody dies
[7351.05s -> 7353.05s]  in the last ten minutes. And the whole entire movie
[7353.05s -> 7361.82s]  is a boring shitty movie.
[7369.32s -> 7371.32s]  This game's been crashing over and over
[7371.32s -> 7373.32s]  for some people. Well thankfully
[7373.32s -> 7375.32s]  that's not happening to us besides the pause
[7375.32s -> 7377.95s]  we asked for.
[7377.95s -> 7379.95s]  No, it's not. It's been two hours. That's enough.
[7379.95s -> 7382.38s]  Dude, Watch Dogs Legion crashed
[7382.38s -> 7384.38s]  like eight times in an hour and ten minutes
[7384.38s -> 7386.38s]  yesterday.
[7386.38s -> 7388.38s]  No, no, we had a pause problem.
[7388.38s -> 7390.56s]  We didn't have a crash, we had a pause problem.
[7390.56s -> 7392.56s]  I had to restart the game.
[7392.56s -> 7397.23s]  I'm not even sure anybody can even die by this point
[7397.23s -> 7405.42s]  anyways.
[7405.42s -> 7408.48s]  I am John.
[7408.48s -> 7411.23s]  Back on the old road.
[7411.23s -> 7413.23s]  Lead your students towards the stick together.
[7413.23s -> 7417.90s]  Go to the stick together.
[7417.90s -> 7419.90s]  I guess that's what we're doing.
[7419.90s -> 7425.92s]  So we're going backwards
[7425.92s -> 7428.48s]  from that to back
[7428.48s -> 7430.48s]  across the bridge.
[7430.48s -> 7432.48s]  I had to fight like
[7432.48s -> 7434.48s]  I had to fight like three demons. It was fucking awesome.
[7434.48s -> 7436.48s]  The only cool part of the game
[7436.48s -> 7438.48s]  so far was like hitting the demon in the head
[7438.48s -> 7440.91s]  with the 2x4.
[7440.91s -> 7442.91s]  I actually found a computer and
[7442.91s -> 7445.60s]  it did the Until Dawn PC port.
[7445.60s -> 7447.60s]  So I was just kind of playing that while I was waiting for you.
[7447.60s -> 7450.80s]  The game was good.
[7458.84s -> 7460.84s]  It was not. Yeah, it was. It was alright.
[7460.84s -> 7462.84s]  It was pretty good.
[7462.84s -> 7467.32s]  Push.
[7467.32s -> 7473.28s]  Did you get any cool action sequences? I had a couple
[7473.28s -> 7475.84s]  that were pretty crazy.
[7475.84s -> 7477.84s]  I hit the demon in the head with the 2x4.
[7477.84s -> 7479.84s]  I found the phone.
[7479.84s -> 7481.84s]  One of the characters tried to fly
[7481.84s -> 7483.84s]  off the roof
[7483.84s -> 7485.84s]  and landed like right on the neck. It was fucking brutal.
[7485.84s -> 7487.84s]  Did you see anything like that?
[7487.84s -> 7491.92s]  I went bowling.
[7491.92s -> 7493.92s]  Maybe we need to check all our other options first.
[7493.92s -> 7496.41s]  Turns out John is not
[7496.41s -> 7498.41s]  only a god of darts but also just like
[7498.41s -> 7500.41s]  other kind of fringe
[7500.41s -> 7504.19s]  options. What was that little smile?
[7504.19s -> 7508.16s]  That was weird. Why do you have a Harry
[7508.16s -> 7512.64s]  Potter scar?
[7512.64s -> 7518.08s]  I could have made Angela go first.
[7518.08s -> 7520.08s]  I'll just have you know.
[7520.08s -> 7522.08s]  So if I die here,
[7522.08s -> 7524.08s]  it was for a good cause. Somebody's going to fall in.
[7524.08s -> 7526.08s]  Who is it going to be? I don't know.
[7526.08s -> 7528.08s]  Are you John? Yeah.
[7528.08s -> 7530.25s]  I'm Andrew.
[7530.25s -> 7532.25s]  Well, that means that
[7532.25s -> 7535.26s]  Karen's dead. Why would we all
[7535.26s -> 7537.26s]  go at the same time?
[7537.26s -> 7544.99s]  No, they're fading away.
[7544.99s -> 7547.36s]  My god. What do we do?
[7547.36s -> 7551.13s]  We can't stay here. The fog reminds
[7551.13s -> 7553.13s]  me of Minecraft draw distance
[7553.13s -> 7555.56s]  in 2014.
[7555.56s -> 7557.56s]  Oh look at a crow.
[7557.56s -> 7559.56s]  That be the crow? I love crows.
[7563.26s -> 7565.26s]  Honey, it's time for your war!
[7565.26s -> 7567.26s]  I thought that was the crow.
[7567.26s -> 7572.51s]  In this year of our lord
[7572.51s -> 7574.51s]  1692.
[7574.51s -> 7576.51s]  It's the same trick every time. Yeah.
[7576.51s -> 7578.51s]  No! It's the fucking
[7578.51s -> 7580.51s]  Oh! My arm! You
[7580.51s -> 7582.51s]  grabbed my wrist and pulled me into another dimension!
[7582.51s -> 7584.51s]  I may be drowned as a witch and sorceress.
[7584.51s -> 7586.51s]  Let's just pray and silence
[7586.51s -> 7588.94s]  next time.
[7592.01s -> 7605.12s]  What'd you say? What'd you say?
[7605.12s -> 7607.12s]  What'd you do? I didn't say anything. What?
[7607.12s -> 7609.12s]  What do you mean you didn't say anything? Why not?
[7609.12s -> 7611.36s]  Because I got information that you don't.
[7611.36s -> 7613.36s]  What the fuck? The devil is in the wind
[7613.36s -> 7615.36s]  seeking to help his own.
[7615.36s -> 7617.36s]  He would release her from the chains.
[7617.36s -> 7619.36s]  Isaac, let us conclude our business here
[7619.36s -> 7621.36s]  swiftly. The will of the court
[7621.36s -> 7623.36s]  must be imposed before it's too late.
[7623.36s -> 7625.85s]  The devil fortifies her.
[7625.85s -> 7627.85s]  You must bind her tightly.
[7627.85s -> 7632.78s]  They're gonna throw her into the ocean.
[7632.78s -> 7640.78s]  Isaac, fill the will of the court.
[7640.78s -> 7642.78s]  Send this witch back into the lap
[7642.78s -> 7644.78s]  of her master lest he come for us all.
[7644.78s -> 7646.78s]  Little Hope is already lost
[7646.78s -> 7648.78s]  shrouded in evil. But not as you
[7648.78s -> 7650.78s]  claim from witchcraft or outside demons
[7650.78s -> 7652.78s]  we are poisoned from within.
[7652.78s -> 7654.78s]  You will not save yourself
[7654.78s -> 7656.78s]  with riddles. There is no riddles.
[7656.78s -> 7658.78s]  The devil takes many forms.
[7658.78s -> 7660.78s]  You know that better than any.
[7660.78s -> 7662.78s]  In little Hope he has hid himself
[7662.78s -> 7664.78s]  under a shroud of innocence.
[7664.78s -> 7666.78s]  Little girl.
[7691.36s -> 7695.07s]  I could get out of that.
[7695.07s -> 7698.65s]  I could get out of that I think.
[7698.65s -> 7709.00s]  Why did she drown instantly?
[7709.00s -> 7714.83s]  Did it happen?
[7714.83s -> 7717.07s]  Where were you?
[7717.07s -> 7719.07s]  Where were you?
[7719.07s -> 7721.07s]  I was watching the person die.
[7721.07s -> 7723.31s]  What person die?
[7723.31s -> 7725.31s]  Her? You mean this lady?
[7725.31s -> 7727.87s]  What did you see? Tell me.
[7727.87s -> 7731.32s]  What did you see?
[7731.32s -> 7733.32s]  What did you see?
[7733.32s -> 7735.32s]  What did you see?
[7735.32s -> 7737.56s]  I'm not exactly sure.
[7737.56s -> 7739.56s]  Another vision I guess?
[7739.56s -> 7741.56s]  An illusion like before?
[7741.56s -> 7743.56s]  She was tied up in a bunch of chains they threw in the ocean.
[7743.56s -> 7745.56s]  Yeah, that's what I said.
[7745.56s -> 7747.56s]  I watched the person die.
[7747.56s -> 7749.56s]  I watched her die and you said who?
[7749.56s -> 7751.56s]  And then I was like wait, what do you mean?
[7751.56s -> 7753.56s]  You asked me who?
[7753.56s -> 7755.56s]  Yeah, and then you didn't say.
[7755.56s -> 7757.56s]  Yeah, because you were like I don't think I should tell you.
[7757.56s -> 7759.56s]  Well, because it sounded like you had seen a different cutscene
[7759.56s -> 7761.56s]  because you didn't know that someone just died.
[7761.56s -> 7765.45s]  So she was killed.
[7765.45s -> 7768.20s]  She's dead.
[7768.20s -> 7773.52s]  What does that mean for me?
[7773.52s -> 7777.68s]  Wait, that's her.
[7777.68s -> 7779.68s]  I'm accidentally gaslighting
[7779.68s -> 7781.68s]  because the last game had us confused.
[7781.68s -> 7785.20s]  Sorry, I'm accidentally gaslighting.
[7785.20s -> 7787.50s]  Okay, so
[7787.50s -> 7789.50s]  the reason I didn't say anything
[7789.50s -> 7793.00s]  is because
[7793.00s -> 7795.00s]  when I was separated from you
[7795.00s -> 7797.00s]  talking to them was bad.
[7797.00s -> 7799.95s]  Oh, okay.
[7799.95s -> 7801.95s]  Alright, I'll go first.
[7801.95s -> 7803.95s]  But it may not be, apparently.
[7803.95s -> 7805.95s]  Because she died anyway.
[7805.95s -> 7809.53s]  I gaslit myself.
[7809.53s -> 7811.84s]  Oh, whoops.
[7811.84s -> 7821.42s]  Alright, does it
[7821.42s -> 7823.42s]  count as a character death if the
[7823.42s -> 7825.42s]  character from like 300 years ago
[7825.42s -> 7827.42s]  died? It's like wouldn't they be dead anyways
[7827.42s -> 7829.42s]  because it's been 300 years. I don't think
[7829.42s -> 7831.42s]  that counts. Well, but I think they come and
[7831.42s -> 7833.42s]  claim the life of the other, of their
[7833.42s -> 7835.42s]  other half. Like right now.
[7835.42s -> 7837.42s]  That's what's going to happen.
[7837.42s -> 7839.42s]  She's going to pop out of the water.
[7841.42s -> 7845.71s]  It's you.
[7845.71s -> 7854.40s]  We're going to go.
[7854.40s -> 7858.88s]  Save her.
[7858.88s -> 7860.88s]  Hey, give me a hand here.
[7860.88s -> 7864.01s]  Hold on, hold on.
[7866.38s -> 7870.28s]  For you, John.
[7870.28s -> 7872.28s]  John?
[7872.28s -> 7874.28s]  You made the right choice.
[7874.28s -> 7876.28s]  I made the right choice.
[7876.28s -> 7881.15s]  What are you doing?
[7881.15s -> 7883.15s]  Never mind, I'll get myself
[7883.15s -> 7885.15s]  Are you serious right now? Okay.
[7885.15s -> 7887.15s]  Let me help John, I'll be right back.
[7887.15s -> 7889.15s]  Why would you do that?
[7891.15s -> 7898.12s]  Abatage!
[7898.12s -> 7908.09s]  Don't worry, I'm going to be fine.
[7910.09s -> 7913.40s]  What?
[7913.40s -> 7915.40s]  What button am I pressing? What's the wrong button?
[7915.40s -> 7917.40s]  I'm clicking, I'm clicking, I'm clicking.
[7917.40s -> 7919.40s]  Don't click.
[7919.40s -> 7921.77s]  What button am I supposed to press?
[7926.14s -> 7928.14s]  Take my hand.
[7928.14s -> 7930.38s]  Take my hand.
[7932.56s -> 7934.86s]  I have another chance to escape.
[7934.86s -> 7936.86s]  Take my hand.
[7936.86s -> 7938.86s]  Put your hand out and help me.
[7940.86s -> 7951.47s]  I'm just watching.
[7951.47s -> 7953.47s]  Bracive, dismissive, derisive.
[7953.47s -> 7956.60s]  Did I do that?
[7959.48s -> 7963.90s]  I may have made those things.
[7963.90s -> 7965.90s]  Oh, you did those things.
[7965.90s -> 7967.90s]  Well, you did them too.
[7967.90s -> 7969.90s]  Okay, so when it was telling me to jump
[7969.90s -> 7971.90s]  What button was I supposed to press?
[7973.90s -> 7975.90s]  I was left clicking when the timer was going down.
[7975.90s -> 7981.21s]  I had to click in the...
[7981.21s -> 7983.21s]  You have to click on the button.
[7983.21s -> 7985.21s]  So remember how you said you made the right choice
[7985.21s -> 7987.21s]  when I chose to save that character first
[7987.21s -> 7989.21s]  and then you refused to take my hand
[7989.21s -> 7991.21s]  when I came to get you?
[7991.21s -> 7993.64s]  I tried to reach for your hand, but I pressed the wrong button.
[7993.64s -> 7995.64s]  We need to get out of here right now.
[7995.64s -> 7998.46s]  I thought it was just click.
[7998.46s -> 8000.46s]  I didn't know I had to click in the circle.
[8000.46s -> 8002.46s]  I guess I screwed it up.
[8002.46s -> 8004.46s]  So it turns out if you play with a controller
[8004.46s -> 8006.46s]  it just tells you which button to press
[8006.46s -> 8008.46s]  and you just push that button.
[8008.46s -> 8010.46s]  The game is fucking broken code.
[8010.46s -> 8012.64s]  That's the worst thing I liked the most too
[8012.64s -> 8015.96s]  and I just killed them.
[8015.96s -> 8017.96s]  You just threw on purpose.
[8017.96s -> 8019.96s]  I swear to God.
[8023.36s -> 8025.36s]  I didn't even know how to click inside the circle.
[8025.36s -> 8027.36s]  That was terrible but avoidable.
[8027.36s -> 8029.36s]  You're getting backseated from this chat now.
[8029.36s -> 8031.36s]  What does this fucking guy know?
[8031.36s -> 8033.72s]  Nothing.
[8035.72s -> 8037.72s]  Literally pretending.
[8042.60s -> 8044.60s]  I'm clicking.
[8047.48s -> 8051.13s]  Fuck you, Jerma.
[8051.13s -> 8058.24s]  You gas litter.
[8058.24s -> 8062.40s]  You gas litter.
[8062.40s -> 8064.40s]  These guys have some interesting theories.
[8064.40s -> 8067.02s]  Maybe you're choosing to believe
[8067.02s -> 8072.38s]  Daniel's theory.
[8072.38s -> 8074.38s]  My dream was lengthened after life.
[8074.38s -> 8076.68s]  Oh then began
[8076.68s -> 8078.68s]  the tempest to my soul.
[8078.68s -> 8080.68s]  I passed me thought
[8080.68s -> 8082.68s]  the melancholy flood
[8082.68s -> 8084.68s]  with that sour ferryman.
[8084.68s -> 8086.68s]  Gas lighting himself.
[8086.68s -> 8088.68s]  Which poets write of.
[8088.68s -> 8092.33s]  Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
[8092.33s -> 8094.33s]  It's possible I suppose.
[8094.33s -> 8096.33s]  Maybe the bus driver
[8096.33s -> 8099.79s]  shed some light.
[8099.79s -> 8101.79s]  This must be very confusing
[8101.79s -> 8103.79s]  for you right now.
[8103.79s -> 8105.79s]  Doppelgangers, witches
[8105.79s -> 8107.79s]  ghosts, death
[8107.79s -> 8109.79s]  and demons.
[8109.79s -> 8111.79s]  What could possibly tie all of these
[8111.79s -> 8114.35s]  souls together?
[8114.35s -> 8116.35s]  I dare say we'll find out.
[8116.35s -> 8119.87s]  I have been granted
[8119.87s -> 8121.87s]  permission to give you a
[8121.87s -> 8123.87s]  single hint.
[8123.87s -> 8125.87s]  What?
[8125.87s -> 8127.87s]  Are you seeing this too?
[8127.87s -> 8130.94s]  Do you want a hint? Yes or no?
[8130.94s -> 8134.08s]  No, no hints.
[8136.32s -> 8138.32s]  Were we not supposed to
[8138.32s -> 8140.32s]  discuss that?
[8140.32s -> 8142.32s]  I guess we were not supposed to discuss.
[8142.32s -> 8144.81s]  I don't think it matters.
[8144.81s -> 8146.81s]  We're just smarter than the game.
[8146.81s -> 8151.10s]  We figured out VoIP.
[8151.10s -> 8153.10s]  This is the only co-op game series that you're not
[8153.10s -> 8155.10s]  allowed to talk to the person you're playing with.
[8157.10s -> 8165.10s]  You killed the best character.
[8165.10s -> 8167.10s]  You knew that was my favorite character.
[8167.10s -> 8169.60s]  If I could have saved Judy
[8169.60s -> 8172.28s]  I would have.
[8172.28s -> 8174.28s]  Sorry, I was literally pretending.
[8174.28s -> 8176.28s]  It's time for a new favorite character.
[8176.28s -> 8178.28s]  My new favorite character is
[8178.28s -> 8180.65s]  the rest of them suck. I don't like the rest of this game.
[8180.65s -> 8182.65s]  This one's deleted.
[8182.65s -> 8184.65s]  Oh great.
[8184.65s -> 8190.54s]  Oh great.
[8207.13s -> 8209.13s]  I love how I'm...
[8209.13s -> 8211.13s]  You had the decision last time
[8211.13s -> 8213.13s]  and I'm saying I tried to help her
[8213.13s -> 8215.13s]  but I sabotaged myself
[8215.13s -> 8217.13s]  as that character.
[8217.13s -> 8219.69s]  You made the right decision as Andrew.
[8227.32s -> 8229.32s]  Oh by the way, you weren't paying attention
[8229.32s -> 8231.32s]  but since you're Andrew now, you have a gun.
[8231.32s -> 8233.32s]  A gun?
[8233.32s -> 8235.32s]  Yeah, you got a gun. I got the gun
[8235.32s -> 8237.32s]  and they're not going to even let me use it
[8237.32s -> 8239.69s]  because you've got it.
[8239.69s -> 8241.69s]  They took that away from me.
[8241.69s -> 8243.69s]  It's mine now.
[8243.69s -> 8247.15s]  Don't worry, I just gave it to you.
[8247.15s -> 8250.35s]  What? Did you?
[8250.35s -> 8252.91s]  No.
[8252.91s -> 8257.07s]  Find a route through the graveyard.
[8257.07s -> 8263.72s]  Are you good?
[8263.72s -> 8265.72s]  I'm actually mad.
[8265.72s -> 8267.72s]  He's going to shoot himself with the gun on purpose.
[8267.72s -> 8269.72s]  No, I'm not going to do that.
[8273.82s -> 8275.82s]  I'm not going to shoot myself with the gun.
[8275.82s -> 8283.95s]  Okay, if I shoot
[8283.95s -> 8285.95s]  myself with the gun, I will give a
[8285.95s -> 8288.83s]  thousand community subs.
[8288.83s -> 8290.83s]  If I actively shoot
[8290.83s -> 8293.26s]  myself with the gun,
[8293.26s -> 8295.26s]  me, and not a cutscene, not like
[8295.26s -> 8297.26s]  oh, I can't control it. Like if I
[8297.26s -> 8299.26s]  put the gun up to my head and pull the trigger and shoot myself
[8299.26s -> 8307.07s]  in the head, I'll give a thousand community subs.
[8307.07s -> 8311.68s]  Where are you? I'm reading tombstones.
[8311.68s -> 8317.63s]  I gotta make that really clear again.
[8317.63s -> 8319.63s]  If I do that in the game in a cutscene,
[8319.63s -> 8321.63s]  that's not me.
[8321.63s -> 8323.63s]  I have to right click,
[8323.63s -> 8325.63s]  hold gun to head below
[8325.63s -> 8327.63s]  shoot head, okay?
[8327.63s -> 8333.84s]  That's how this works. That's a very important
[8333.84s -> 8336.72s]  distinction. Because I swear to God,
[8336.72s -> 8338.72s]  if there's a cutscene where this character shoots himself
[8338.72s -> 8340.72s]  in the head, I'm going to be really mad
[8340.72s -> 8343.34s]  because that's not what I was saying.
[8343.34s -> 8345.34s]  Here lies the body of Abraham Alastor.
[8345.34s -> 8350.38s]  Oh.
[8350.38s -> 8354.54s]  Hey, thanks for pulling me.
[8354.54s -> 8365.23s]  Hey, the character's still alive.
[8365.23s -> 8369.26s]  She just comes up and
[8369.26s -> 8371.26s]  stands next to him and is like, hey guys.
[8371.26s -> 8373.76s]  Let's stay away from
[8373.76s -> 8375.76s]  that bridge. I want to play as
[8375.76s -> 8377.76s]  her again, even in this form. Pretty sure Daniel
[8377.76s -> 8379.76s]  and Taylor would be thinking the same thing.
[8379.76s -> 8388.19s]  Out of sight, quick!
[8388.19s -> 8390.19s]  Shoot head with gun.
[8390.19s -> 8405.74s]  My heartbeat is very irregular
[8405.74s -> 8409.07s]  right now. Oh,
[8409.07s -> 8411.07s]  it's him. Yeah, it's bike guy
[8411.07s -> 8416.83s]  again. This is the second time I've
[8416.83s -> 8419.45s]  seen him. But we always hide from him.
[8419.45s -> 8424.38s]  Why wouldn't we just flag this guy down
[8424.38s -> 8426.38s]  and say, hey, remember
[8426.38s -> 8428.38s]  us during?
[8446.14s -> 8448.14s]  No, about not missing QTEs on purpose.
[8448.14s -> 8450.83s]  Make your chat angry at you
[8450.83s -> 8454.99s]  deliberately.
[8454.99s -> 8460.56s]  Confess to a Twitch crime.
[8460.56s -> 8467.85s]  I'll go in and take a look around.
[8467.85s -> 8473.48s]  Oh, shit. It's funny that Jerma
[8473.48s -> 8475.48s]  thinks he's funny. As far as walking sticks go, I feel like
[8475.48s -> 8477.48s]  the pointed edge is probably not very effective.
[8477.48s -> 8483.50s]  VIP that guy for a minute.
[8483.50s -> 8485.80s]  I can't believe Angela's gone. I mean,
[8485.80s -> 8488.75s]  what the fuck?
[8488.75s -> 8492.27s]  It's tough for sure, but
[8492.27s -> 8494.89s]  tougher on you. You two
[8494.89s -> 8498.48s]  are pretty tight.
[8498.48s -> 8501.55s]  We split up again?
[8501.55s -> 8503.90s]  No. Oh wait, this is me and you.
[8503.90s -> 8509.34s]  I couldn't do this without you.
[8509.34s -> 8511.34s]  Don't let go.
[8511.34s -> 8513.34s]  Don't let go.
[8513.34s -> 8515.34s]  Don't let go.
[8515.34s -> 8521.74s]  Just do nothing and stay here.
[8521.74s -> 8527.24s]  Synchronized.
[8531.87s -> 8533.87s]  Make this moment last forever.
[8533.87s -> 8536.24s]  Hey, I found the witches.
[8536.24s -> 8538.24s]  They're this way.
[8538.24s -> 8540.24s]  Let me read that sign. What's that sign say?
[8540.24s -> 8542.24s]  Witch trial.
[8542.24s -> 8544.24s]  Witch trail.
[8544.24s -> 8546.60s]  This way. That'd be kind of weird.
[8546.60s -> 8548.60s]  This way for the witch
[8548.60s -> 8552.89s]  trial.
[8552.89s -> 8554.89s]  It's still weird because it's witch trail.
[8554.89s -> 8556.89s]  Yeah, somebody thinks they're funny.
[8556.89s -> 8560.54s]  I don't like this.
[8560.54s -> 8562.54s]  I want to go another way.
[8562.54s -> 8567.79s]  Don't think there is another way.
[8567.79s -> 8575.85s]  He can't climb and he can't read.
[8575.85s -> 8577.85s]  Quite the tourist trail.
[8577.85s -> 8579.85s]  Not a place I want to revisit.
[8579.85s -> 8582.54s]  You found a secret. Yeah, it's just a map.
[8582.54s -> 8587.77s]  The secret map.
[8587.77s -> 8589.77s]  Massacre memorial.
[8589.77s -> 8592.08s]  What the hell is that?
[8592.08s -> 8594.08s]  There's also a buffet.
[8594.08s -> 8596.08s]  Remember, you're a giggle puss today.
[8596.08s -> 8598.08s]  I am very giggly today. I'm having fun.
[8598.08s -> 8607.55s]  I get very giggly when I have fun.
[8607.55s -> 8609.55s]  This is the first time you've controlled, Taylor.
[8609.55s -> 8611.92s]  I feel like you're having the whole game.
[8621.77s -> 8624.52s]  Bridge. It's going to fall.
[8631.72s -> 8633.72s]  Hey, remember when you said alligator POV?
[8633.72s -> 8635.72s]  I did.
[8635.72s -> 8638.67s]  Is it there?
[8638.67s -> 8640.67s]  Did you get an alligator POV?
[8640.67s -> 8642.67s]  There it was.
[8652.67s -> 8655.55s]  Don't mess up
[8655.55s -> 8658.56s]  the jump QTE.
[8658.56s -> 8660.56s]  They're going to burn you
[8660.56s -> 8662.56s]  at the stake.
[8665.56s -> 8671.32s]  I have to do it?
[8671.32s -> 8674.65s]  I have a feeling we're going to get
[8674.65s -> 8676.65s]  a hundred percent worst
[8676.65s -> 8678.65s]  ending death, everyone.
[8678.65s -> 8685.82s]  It was just a debate. We're fine.
[8688.62s -> 8714.19s]  What's that?
[8714.19s -> 8718.28s]  Witchgrave?
[8718.28s -> 8720.28s]  The stone is believed.
[8720.28s -> 8722.52s]  The first person executed during the witch trials.
[8722.52s -> 8726.24s]  They got a gold medal.
[8726.24s -> 8729.37s]  That's pretty fucked up. That's not too much rating.
[8729.37s -> 8732.19s]  It's less than a paragraph.
[8735.52s -> 8737.52s]  Why was he like that?
[8748.91s -> 8752.24s]  That
[8752.24s -> 8754.24s]  little girl is evil.
[8754.24s -> 8756.24s]  That's an evil dog.
[8756.24s -> 8758.24s]  Mr. Pickles is evil.
[8767.26s -> 8769.26s]  He's going to trick us into killing the little kid.
[8769.26s -> 8773.80s]  Probably.
[8779.80s -> 8782.04s]  Or she's going to kill us accidentally.
[8787.69s -> 8789.69s]  That's Taylor, right?
[8796.44s -> 8801.37s]  No, that's Abatha.
[8817.74s -> 8822.40s]  Hey, do you have anything to say about that?
[8822.40s -> 8824.40s]  That was pretty fucked up.
[8824.40s -> 8832.52s]  Apparently not.
[8832.52s -> 8834.52s]  He fucked off like 30 minutes ago.
[8834.52s -> 8839.64s]  Where'd he go?
[8839.64s -> 8843.10s]  No working phone anywhere.
[8843.10s -> 8845.10s]  Okay, so it looks like we really are trapped here.
[8845.10s -> 8847.53s]  Still no sign of him?
[8847.53s -> 8849.53s]  Nope.
[8849.53s -> 8851.53s]  We're still looking for a working phone? That's the only thing...
[8851.53s -> 8853.53s]  We're just looking for
[8853.53s -> 8855.53s]  a way to communicate with the outside world still.
[8855.53s -> 8857.53s]  That's what I did.
[8857.53s -> 8859.77s]  Well, you were separated.
[8859.77s -> 8862.14s]  And it didn't go well.
[8862.14s -> 8868.80s]  Well, she is.
[8868.80s -> 8870.80s]  I think she wants us to go after her.
[8870.80s -> 8873.61s]  Two girls we've seen.
[8873.61s -> 8875.61s]  One is from the past.
[8875.61s -> 8878.30s]  And one is from here now.
[8878.30s -> 8880.30s]  Maybe the girl we're seeing here is
[8880.30s -> 8882.30s]  somehow a mirror image of the girl from the 17th century.
[8882.30s -> 8884.30s]  Yes.
[8884.30s -> 8886.30s]  Don't you want to wait for Daniel and Taylor?
[8886.30s -> 8888.30s]  If this takes place in 1701, isn't this the 18th century?
[8890.30s -> 8892.86s]  You're thinking there.
[8892.86s -> 8895.74s]  That's true.
[8895.74s -> 8905.64s]  That was weird.
[8905.64s -> 8909.74s]  It's because that lady died
[8909.74s -> 8911.74s]  it just jump cut to us here.
[8911.74s -> 8913.74s]  Maybe if we didn't...
[8913.74s -> 8918.97s]  That was weird. Memento.
[8918.97s -> 8921.34s]  I feel like this is an opportunity
[8921.34s -> 8924.67s]  for somebody to die.
[8924.67s -> 8926.67s]  There's something blocking the door.
[8926.67s -> 8930.64s]  Give me a hand, will you?
[8930.64s -> 8935.61s]  It's a little girl.
[8935.61s -> 8944.70s]  Heavy chair.
[8944.70s -> 8946.70s]  This place is a museum
[8946.70s -> 8950.41s]  of some kind.
[8950.41s -> 8952.41s]  It's not a museum, it's just
[8952.41s -> 8954.41s]  really old.
[8954.41s -> 8957.80s]  It's an old house.
[8957.80s -> 8959.80s]  Thank god I'm not Andrew, because if you shoot yourself in the head,
[8959.80s -> 8961.80s]  but if it was me, I would have to give a thousand community subs to my community.
[8961.80s -> 8965.77s]  Community?
[8965.77s -> 8967.77s]  Yeah, but we're both Andrew.
[8967.77s -> 8969.77s]  No, you're Andrew right now.
[8969.77s -> 8971.77s]  So if you shoot yourself in the head with the gun, I don't have to do anything.
[8981.44s -> 8983.44s]  What now?
[8983.44s -> 8988.75s]  Is it Dummies?
[8988.75s -> 8997.96s]  The book is on sale, it's only $8.
[8997.96s -> 9005.12s]  What if Italic shoots you
[9005.12s -> 9008.51s]  in the head? No.
[9008.51s -> 9010.51s]  The deal was, if I had an opportunity
[9010.51s -> 9012.81s]  to shoot myself in the head with the gun,
[9012.81s -> 9014.81s]  and I right click, aim gun at head,
[9014.81s -> 9017.05s]  shoot head with gun, then I would give a thousand community subs,
[9017.05s -> 9019.05s]  because I said there's no way I would do that.
[9019.05s -> 9023.98s]  I'm not going to make that, I'm not going to let it happen.
[9023.98s -> 9026.92s]  I already read this book.
[9026.92s -> 9030.57s]  Oh, this is the mannequin house. One of these mannequins.
[9030.57s -> 9032.57s]  You try this door? Ain't a mannequin.
[9032.57s -> 9036.54s]  I don't even know where you are.
[9036.54s -> 9050.67s]  I'm in the same room.
[9050.67s -> 9053.16s]  I'm stuck. Wait, hold on.
[9053.16s -> 9060.38s]  Are there any doors that are actually open?
[9060.38s -> 9068.44s]  Or are we just stuck in here?
[9068.44s -> 9071.32s]  It's a museum, you're always stuck in there.
[9071.32s -> 9073.32s]  You just read stuff.
[9073.32s -> 9076.14s]  Rit of forfeiture.
[9076.14s -> 9078.14s]  Yeah, yeah.
[9078.14s -> 9080.14s]  Did you push all these hanging mannequins
[9080.14s -> 9082.14s]  by chance? I did not.
[9082.14s -> 9084.38s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[9084.38s -> 9086.38s]  The board of selection on the 7th day of January
[9086.38s -> 9088.81s]  1692.
[9088.81s -> 9090.81s]  You ordered two caricatures
[9090.81s -> 9092.81s]  of the land by Western River
[9092.81s -> 9094.81s]  and they were over there dwellings upon the land
[9094.81s -> 9096.81s]  so they followed forward or whatever.
[9096.81s -> 9104.03s]  But you found a secret.
[9104.03s -> 9111.96s]  It says, Mary
[9111.96s -> 9113.96s]  confessed to
[9113.96s -> 9115.96s]  Bad stuff.
[9115.96s -> 9119.16s]  Mary confessed.
[9119.16s -> 9121.60s]  Well, what the heck?
[9121.60s -> 9123.60s]  It was her testimony
[9123.60s -> 9125.60s]  that got the other person killed.
[9125.60s -> 9127.60s]  Oh.
[9127.60s -> 9130.35s]  Did that cut off for you?
[9130.35s -> 9132.35s]  Yeah, this kid Mary had schnitzel?
[9132.35s -> 9135.42s]  The enclosed puppet or doll
[9135.42s -> 9137.42s]  is thought to have originally belonged to a child.
[9137.42s -> 9144.97s]  Come take a look at this.
[9144.97s -> 9147.98s]  I've seen this before. Where?
[9147.98s -> 9150.48s]  On the road outside that shitty little bar
[9150.48s -> 9152.48s]  we stopped at.
[9152.48s -> 9154.48s]  Angela and me saw it laying there, picked it up.
[9154.48s -> 9156.48s]  Not bad.
[9167.42s -> 9172.86s]  How many video games
[9172.86s -> 9174.86s]  is this that dude in that's Andrew?
[9174.86s -> 9176.86s]  I feel like I see his computer generated
[9176.86s -> 9180.51s]  face all the fucking time.
[9180.51s -> 9182.51s]  Maybe you just watched
[9182.51s -> 9184.51s]  every trailer for this game.
[9196.67s -> 9201.34s]  No, that's a bad idea.
[9201.34s -> 9203.58s]  You want to look at intentionally throwing.
[9214.92s -> 9221.58s]  Yeah, it kind of was.
[9221.58s -> 9223.58s]  But I've seen his face before in CG
[9223.58s -> 9226.20s]  like this.
[9226.20s -> 9233.76s]  More than once or twice.
[9233.76s -> 9235.76s]  Wait, why are we looking at the doll again?
[9235.76s -> 9237.76s]  We're gonna have another conversation about the doll.
[9237.76s -> 9245.56s]  Where's the gift shop?
[9245.56s -> 9248.32s]  It was the kid in Toy Story.
[9248.32s -> 9253.82s]  That wasn't based on anybody's real face.
[9253.82s -> 9255.82s]  Did this museum ever even open?
[9263.32s -> 9267.87s]  Be so satisfying.
[9267.87s -> 9270.88s]  The cat's gonna mean something.
[9270.88s -> 9274.78s]  The cat's gonna start talking.
[9274.78s -> 9276.78s]  Or it's gonna lead us somewhere
[9276.78s -> 9278.78s]  where the cat saves the day.
[9278.78s -> 9280.78s]  The cat is the transformation
[9280.78s -> 9282.78s]  that the guy in the
[9282.78s -> 9284.78s]  office that like
[9284.78s -> 9286.78s]  doesn't ad break to talk to us
[9286.78s -> 9288.78s]  is. He's like watching us.
[9288.78s -> 9290.78s]  Oh, right. Yeah, that makes sense. That's him.
[9315.88s -> 9324.12s]  Okay.
[9324.12s -> 9326.12s]  What did we find out? What did we do in there?
[9326.12s -> 9328.12s]  That was worth talking about.
[9334.83s -> 9336.83s]  Yeah, you're right. We're pretty overdue for a
[9336.83s -> 9338.83s]  lore hand grab. You're right.
[9341.90s -> 9344.84s]  No apps on your phone?
[9344.84s -> 9353.48s]  What kind of alien person are you?
[9357.48s -> 9359.48s]  Oh, I'm Daniel.
[9359.48s -> 9361.48s]  The professor was real keen to get into town.
[9361.48s -> 9364.56s]  Oh, yeah. Let's go through the sewer.
[9364.56s -> 9366.73s]  You don't want to climb
[9366.73s -> 9369.61s]  through the sewer grate?
[9369.61s -> 9371.61s]  There's literally a fire
[9371.61s -> 9373.61s]  on the... Look up.
[9373.61s -> 9375.61s]  Look towards the sewer, but up.
[9375.61s -> 9379.26s]  I can't. I can't look up.
[9379.26s -> 9381.26s]  What do you mean you can't look up?
[9381.26s -> 9383.26s]  Come over here.
[9383.26s -> 9385.63s]  There's a fire. You're right.
[9385.63s -> 9388.56s]  Just walk towards the light.
[9388.56s -> 9390.56s]  Well, you can't.
[9390.56s -> 9394.91s]  Video game characters can't climb
[9394.91s -> 9399.20s]  out of QTE. Okay.
[9399.20s -> 9402.01s]  Okay. Leave it at
[9402.01s -> 9404.01s]  the door here. Okay.
[9404.01s -> 9406.01s]  We don't want to get... You don't want to get me angry.
[9433.21s -> 9435.71s]  Be honest.
[9435.71s -> 9437.71s]  Anybody getting sick of
[9437.71s -> 9439.71s]  let's find a way into the house?
[9439.71s -> 9441.71s]  I feel like this happens over and over again in this game.
[9441.71s -> 9445.29s]  Dude, we gotta find a phone.
[9445.29s -> 9447.98s]  Even though we all have phones,
[9447.98s -> 9449.98s]  we gotta find a landline.
[9449.98s -> 9452.35s]  A house? Find a way in. Okay. Another place?
[9452.35s -> 9454.35s]  Let's find a way in. Now that door's locked.
[9454.35s -> 9456.59s]  Find a way around the other side. Crawl on the window.
[9456.59s -> 9461.52s]  Why can't there just be open doors?
[9461.52s -> 9470.80s]  We gotta go through the skylight.
[9470.80s -> 9475.72s]  We're probably on like two or three
[9475.72s -> 9477.72s]  different timelines. It's probably...
[9477.72s -> 9481.37s]  They're gonna do some saw ending.
[9481.37s -> 9483.37s]  They're gonna be like...
[9484.37s -> 9486.37s]  They're gonna explain the whole thing.
[9498.77s -> 9500.77s]  Another window. Oh, let's try to open it.
[9505.59s -> 9507.59s]  I never shot myself in the head with a gun.
[9507.59s -> 9512.77s]  I don't owe you anything.
[9519.48s -> 9521.48s]  We've done this like four times.
[9521.48s -> 9524.42s]  I don't want to open another fucking window
[9524.42s -> 9526.42s]  and crawl in a building. Like what the fuck?
[9529.42s -> 9531.42s]  Option one, open a door. Option two, open a window.
[9531.42s -> 9533.42s]  Option three, cross a bridge.
[9533.42s -> 9535.42s]  And option four, get grabbed for lore.
[9535.42s -> 9537.42s]  Pick one.
[9539.42s -> 9541.66s]  I choose lore hand
[9541.66s -> 9546.84s]  over anything else.
[9546.84s -> 9551.13s]  Alright, find a way to the others.
[9551.13s -> 9553.13s]  Did they just get jumpscared by the same mannequins
[9553.13s -> 9555.63s]  that we just walked past in the last
[9555.63s -> 9557.63s]  gameplay segment? Yeah, but they came into the window.
[9557.63s -> 9560.12s]  Yeah, but it was supposed to scare us.
[9560.12s -> 9562.81s]  Oh.
[9562.81s -> 9565.82s]  Oh.
[9571.84s -> 9573.84s]  And enough with the movie trailer
[9573.84s -> 9575.84s]  run across the frame.
[9575.84s -> 9577.84s]  Alright.
[9579.84s -> 9581.84s]  That's true.
[9583.84s -> 9594.27s]  Nope.
[9594.27s -> 9597.47s]  Get in there and take a picture.
[9597.47s -> 9599.47s]  I'm in the medieval times.
[9599.47s -> 9603.56s]  We're on Instagram.
[9603.56s -> 9605.56s]  Okay, I'm going in for lore.
[9605.56s -> 9607.56s]  Oh, you are?
[9607.56s -> 9614.73s]  I just heard a crunch.
[9614.73s -> 9616.73s]  Okay, he's been ported.
[9616.73s -> 9618.73s]  There was a crunch and then he disappeared.
[9618.73s -> 9621.61s]  I'm going in for lore.
[9625.69s -> 9627.69s]  God damn it. We both
[9627.69s -> 9629.69s]  have a hand of cards in our hands.
[9629.69s -> 9631.69s]  I got walk around as NPC
[9631.69s -> 9633.69s]  and climb through a window. He got lore
[9633.69s -> 9636.76s]  hand. Bullshit.
[9636.76s -> 9657.24s]  He top decked that.
[9657.24s -> 9666.76s]  He's not even in there.
[9666.76s -> 9668.76s]  It's not going to open.
[9668.76s -> 9671.20s]  Oh, no. I just drew
[9671.20s -> 9673.20s]  from my deck. Can't open door
[9673.20s -> 9676.33s]  by pushing on it hard.
[9676.33s -> 9683.95s]  What's next?
[9686.51s -> 9689.20s]  What happened?
[9691.20s -> 9693.20s]  What happened in here?
[9693.20s -> 9696.08s]  You got lore snatched.
[9696.08s -> 9700.88s]  Fucking so weird. Speaking funny.
[9708.03s -> 9711.72s]  Sorry I wasn't there for you.
[9711.72s -> 9713.72s]  This woman, the one who looked like me, they just
[9713.72s -> 9716.41s]  dragged her out like some kind of
[9716.41s -> 9720.12s]  criminal. I mean, shit.
[9720.12s -> 9724.33s]  What?
[9724.33s -> 9726.33s]  Let's get out of here. I hear that.
[9726.33s -> 9728.33s]  So I saw the little kid
[9728.33s -> 9730.33s]  in like the 1700s and she started
[9730.33s -> 9732.33s]  flossing and then they said that she was demon
[9732.33s -> 9734.83s]  possessed. You know, I kind of wish
[9734.83s -> 9736.83s]  that's really what happened. I would give this game
[9736.83s -> 9740.09s]  a full letter grade if that were real.
[9740.09s -> 9742.09s]  It's not that far off from what happened.
[9742.09s -> 9746.96s]  They took the other person.
[9746.96s -> 9749.71s]  They took my double instead.
[9749.71s -> 9753.16s]  I found a knife. Maybe it was a knife
[9753.16s -> 9755.53s]  once when dinosaurs roamed
[9755.53s -> 9757.53s]  the earth. It said pathetic.
[9757.53s -> 9759.53s]  I'm not pathetic.
[9759.53s -> 9765.92s]  Here, you take it.
[9765.92s -> 9767.92s]  Why? Alright, if you stab yourself
[9767.92s -> 9769.92s]  in the head, it's 2000 something.
[9769.92s -> 9772.35s]  No, you can't say that.
[9772.35s -> 9774.91s]  You take it. I don't want it.
[9774.91s -> 9776.91s]  Just in case. You have it. I'm not taking it.
[9776.91s -> 9783.95s]  I don't have the knife.
[9783.95s -> 9786.12s]  I gave it to you first.
[9786.12s -> 9791.50s]  But I gave it back to you.
[9791.50s -> 9794.25s]  I tail tailed you, dude. You tried.
[9794.25s -> 9797.95s]  I tried. We both tried.
[9797.95s -> 9803.32s]  Watch the knife just be on the ground.
[9803.32s -> 9805.32s]  Where am I keeping the knife is what I want to know.
[9805.32s -> 9807.69s]  It's a knife. It doesn't have a sheath.
[9807.69s -> 9812.17s]  Did I just put it in my pants?
[9812.17s -> 9814.99s]  That wasn't even scary.
[9814.99s -> 9816.99s]  It's just dangerous.
[9816.99s -> 9822.81s]  I found the Bible, but there's no lore.
[9822.81s -> 9825.80s]  It just says Bible. Oh, never mind.
[9825.80s -> 9827.80s]  I found all the witchcraft.
[9827.80s -> 9831.32s]  Oh, I found caricature.
[9831.32s -> 9835.68s]  And a piece of wood.
[9835.68s -> 9837.68s]  Oh, this is the wood that I hit the demon in the head with.
[9837.68s -> 9848.36s]  The 2x4.
[9848.36s -> 9850.36s]  Amy Lambert. Amy was accused of witchcraft
[9850.36s -> 9852.73s]  by the girl Mary Milton
[9852.73s -> 9854.73s]  who claimed she saw her fly on a twig of willow
[9854.73s -> 9857.55s]  and told by the court that Amy
[9857.55s -> 9859.55s]  had been seen by witnesses many miles away.
[9859.55s -> 9861.92s]  Mary stated, I saw her lips
[9861.92s -> 9864.28s]  ever chattering. Who knew
[9864.28s -> 9866.46s]  what and recognized her
[9866.46s -> 9868.46s]  as a demon sent to me in Amy's form.
[9868.46s -> 9870.76s]  Pastor Carver admitted
[9870.76s -> 9872.76s]  this into the record as spectral
[9872.76s -> 9875.58s]  evidence. That was a paragraph. I'm fine.
[9875.58s -> 9878.20s]  Hey, can you come over here?
[9878.20s -> 9884.09s]  Sure. Do you think this is like
[9884.09s -> 9886.40s]  chiropractors in the 1700s
[9886.40s -> 9889.76s]  right here? This? No.
[9889.76s -> 9891.76s]  What my flashlight's pointing at.
[9891.76s -> 9893.76s]  That's a cheese wheel. That's like a
[9893.76s -> 9896.12s]  Marble Stiltskin wheel. Oh, yes.
[9896.12s -> 9901.48s]  Yeah.
[9901.48s -> 9903.48s]  We're going to rid your body of pain by
[9903.48s -> 9907.20s]  putting pain on top of you.
[9907.20s -> 9915.13s]  No, this is torture, right? I think
[9915.13s -> 9919.21s]  it's T-posing. Okay, so what else
[9919.21s -> 9921.21s]  do we have to do in our second playthrough
[9921.21s -> 9923.21s]  of the Museum Leopard? I heard a loud
[9923.21s -> 9925.21s]  noise, but I didn't see anything. It was this.
[9925.21s -> 9927.21s]  This thing just fell over, tried to scare me. It didn't even work.
[9927.21s -> 9931.68s]  I looked at that already. I'm stuck.
[9931.68s -> 9933.92s]  Don't look at it again. Don't look at it again. No.
[9933.92s -> 9942.03s]  Don't look at it. We didn't look in here, right?
[9942.03s -> 9944.83s]  Yeah, we checked this area. Clues.
[9944.83s -> 9947.26s]  Yeah, you read this one. What about this painting?
[9947.26s -> 9950.40s]  The doll's gone. That's what the thing
[9950.40s -> 9952.94s]  is. Oh. They took
[9952.94s -> 9955.82s]  the doll. This is
[9955.82s -> 9959.53s]  the ace attorney thing.
[9959.53s -> 9966.89s]  Look at this. The enclosed puppet
[9966.89s -> 9968.89s]  or doll is thought to have
[9968.89s -> 9970.89s]  originally belonged to a child. Yeah, the doll's gone, yeah.
[9970.89s -> 9974.73s]  In the 1600s. Creepy.
[9974.73s -> 9977.68s]  Window scare. Shit, wait,
[9977.68s -> 9979.68s]  I got it. What was the cat again? This missing doll has
[9979.68s -> 9981.68s]  got to be the one I saw with the kid.
[9981.68s -> 9986.40s]  You think? That's kind of weird.
[9986.40s -> 9988.40s]  Kind of weird? People are saying we should have burnt it. This place is full on
[9988.40s -> 9990.40s]  Nightmare Central. I don't want to
[9990.40s -> 9992.40s]  stay here any longer than I have. We had an opportunity
[9992.40s -> 9994.40s]  to burn it, remember? With you on that. The last two?
[9994.40s -> 9997.60s]  Oh, you don't know that. It said
[9997.60s -> 10000.35s]  burn it or put it back. Oh, yeah,
[10000.35s -> 10002.35s]  I didn't know that. Yeah, but I didn't want to be like
[10002.35s -> 10005.04s]  intentionally ruin the game Andy.
[10005.04s -> 10007.04s]  I'm saying Andy a lot. How many Andes are there?
[10007.04s -> 10009.04s]  I'm saying Andy a lot.
[10009.04s -> 10014.60s]  Alright, I'm not going to say Andy anymore.
[10014.60s -> 10022.09s]  You're kind of an Andy Andy. One guy
[10022.09s -> 10024.09s]  said it like a month ago.
[10024.09s -> 10026.09s]  Some people said it and then it was during
[10026.09s -> 10028.09s]  Fall Guys stream. It was the worst Fall Guys player
[10028.09s -> 10030.09s]  on Twitch, first of all.
[10030.09s -> 10033.92s]  It just stuck with me. Did you
[10033.92s -> 10036.09s]  ever even get a medal? No, not one.
[10036.09s -> 10038.52s]  No, that's not all. I did. I got one
[10038.52s -> 10040.52s]  medal because everybody disconnected and I was the last person
[10040.52s -> 10045.63s]  in the game. That's real. It still counts.
[10045.63s -> 10047.63s]  Does it count? I mean, you got
[10047.63s -> 10049.63s]  five, didn't you?
[10049.63s -> 10051.63s]  I got like three.
[10051.63s -> 10058.16s]  Oh, it's my knife.
[10058.16s -> 10068.00s]  Oh, that is the knife. You're right.
[10068.00s -> 10070.00s]  Another instrument of death
[10070.00s -> 10072.00s]  added to the group's collection.
[10072.00s -> 10080.17s]  Good work.
[10080.17s -> 10082.17s]  Let me help you out.
[10082.17s -> 10084.17s]  Give you one little
[10084.17s -> 10086.17s]  hint. He's so badly.
[10086.17s -> 10088.17s]  Okay, we don't talk about
[10088.17s -> 10090.17s]  this. We don't talk about this?
[10090.17s -> 10092.92s]  We just have to decide.
[10092.92s -> 10094.92s]  One says yes and one says
[10094.92s -> 10096.92s]  no. Did I say yes?
[10096.92s -> 10098.92s]  Well, here's a hint for people that can't
[10098.92s -> 10100.92s]  cooperate.
[10100.92s -> 10105.15s]  Cooperate!
[10105.15s -> 10107.15s]  Best line of the game so far.
[10107.15s -> 10109.15s]  I'll leave you now with some
[10109.15s -> 10111.15s]  wise words from a great
[10111.15s -> 10113.15s]  Irish playwright I once met.
[10113.15s -> 10115.15s]  I feel like the devs reaching out
[10115.15s -> 10117.15s]  to us like, please
[10117.15s -> 10119.64s]  God, just work together.
[10119.64s -> 10122.20s]  Never judge anyone shortly.
[10122.20s -> 10124.20s]  Every saint has a past
[10124.20s -> 10126.20s]  and every sinner has a
[10126.20s -> 10128.15s]  future.
[10128.15s -> 10130.15s]  Is it a lore hint?
[10130.15s -> 10132.15s]  I'm assuming he tells you a piece
[10132.15s -> 10135.92s]  of the story.
[10135.92s -> 10138.68s]  You remember how like Man of Medan,
[10138.68s -> 10140.92s]  he tried to like give us a hint that
[10140.92s -> 10142.92s]  the monsters are not what they seem.
[10142.92s -> 10144.92s]  But without just
[10144.92s -> 10146.92s]  spoiling the game, why even
[10146.92s -> 10148.92s]  have that? I don't understand.
[10148.92s -> 10151.86s]  He's just asking if you want to read his
[10151.86s -> 10153.86s]  Wikipedia article he's going to read to you?
[10153.86s -> 10155.86s]  I think because most people who play
[10155.86s -> 10157.86s]  these games, we'll call them normal
[10157.86s -> 10160.29s]  people, don't want all the characters
[10160.29s -> 10162.29s]  to die when the credits roll.
[10162.29s -> 10164.29s]  But when you do a psycho
[10164.29s -> 10166.66s]  playthrough, we are pretty ambivalent
[10166.66s -> 10169.20s]  about them.
[10169.20s -> 10171.20s]  I'm going for the
[10171.20s -> 10173.20s]  I see a shiny thing, so I'm just going to pick it up.
[10173.20s -> 10183.12s]  Yeah, this is shiny over here too.
[10183.12s -> 10185.43s]  This is
[10185.43s -> 10187.43s]  I mean, the one piece of
[10187.43s -> 10190.05s]  wood blocking the thing.
[10190.05s -> 10192.05s]  Well, I know who's next on the chopping block.
[10192.05s -> 10196.07s]  And it ain't
[10196.07s -> 10202.92s]  me. What do you mean? How do you know?
[10202.92s -> 10204.92s]  You know? Did you get a permission?
[10204.92s -> 10208.69s]  Oh, I know.
[10208.69s -> 10210.69s]  Does it involve a
[10210.69s -> 10212.69s]  gun being pointed to anyone's head?
[10212.69s -> 10215.00s]  Stand right behind me.
[10215.00s -> 10224.26s]  But like over one of my shoulders.
[10224.26s -> 10226.26s]  Oh, you bumped me. Apparently, if you
[10226.26s -> 10228.26s]  go idle for like more than 10 seconds,
[10228.26s -> 10230.56s]  it does like a zoom
[10230.56s -> 10232.56s]  in, and you get the man-of-the-dan
[10232.56s -> 10242.42s]  facial. Oh.
[10242.42s -> 10244.72s]  You have to wait. I am.
[10244.72s -> 10250.68s]  If it doesn't do it again, it's going to be
[10250.68s -> 10252.68s]  really embarrassing.
[10252.68s -> 10256.45s]  It's not doing it. Maybe it's because you were looking
[10256.45s -> 10258.45s]  at the lore. I don't know. But I got the full
[10258.45s -> 10260.45s]  Oh, there it is. No.
[10260.45s -> 10262.82s]  I want to raise his hands and go
[10262.82s -> 10265.57s]  yeeeeeeah
[10265.57s -> 10272.16s]  and fall asleep like fucking Super Mario.
[10272.16s -> 10274.16s]  Who's bumping me out of it? Did you bump me
[10274.16s -> 10276.40s]  again? I'm not even close to you. I'm on the
[10276.40s -> 10282.79s]  road.
[10282.79s -> 10284.79s]  Oh, sorry. I didn't appropriate the noise
[10284.79s -> 10286.79s]  correctly. That noise I made was Mario
[10286.79s -> 10288.79s]  climbing up a cliff.
[10288.79s -> 10291.35s]  What I meant to say was Mario was tired.
[10291.35s -> 10293.52s]  Right. I got the noises wrong.
[10293.52s -> 10297.22s]  I apologize. Okay, I'm done.
[10297.22s -> 10306.69s]  Are you here? Yeah, it's I'm a tired.
[10306.69s -> 10308.69s]  Yeah, that's my fault.
[10312.85s -> 10319.88s]  The same
[10319.88s -> 10324.61s]  road. Honestly,
[10324.61s -> 10326.61s]  there are some Call of Duty maps that are bigger
[10326.61s -> 10335.12s]  than this.
[10335.12s -> 10337.12s]  You're blowing this out. It's overexposed. I can't say
[10337.12s -> 10339.12s]  this.
[10339.12s -> 10341.12s]  It is?
[10341.12s -> 10344.88s]  I'm sorry.
[10344.88s -> 10351.27s]  It's me.
[10351.27s -> 10353.27s]  This place is as big as
[10353.27s -> 10355.83s]  fucking Nuke Town.
[10355.83s -> 10360.12s]  The fog's coming back. Foreclosure.
[10360.12s -> 10364.66s]  Bank owned. Keep up. Flashlighting
[10364.66s -> 10369.19s]  stream.
[10369.19s -> 10371.19s]  We've got a roadblock, so we've got to take the detour.
[10371.19s -> 10376.69s]  Or we can walk up to the roadblock.
[10376.69s -> 10378.93s]  Let them say, it's roadblock.
[10378.93s -> 10380.93s]  And then we can take the detour. That's what's going to happen.
[10380.93s -> 10388.66s]  Where the hell is that coming from?
[10388.66s -> 10390.66s]  Coming from the crow. It's like a Bluetooth speaker.
[10390.66s -> 10394.95s]  The significance to the crow.
[10394.95s -> 10396.95s]  Oh, that wasn't a cutscene. I was just
[10396.95s -> 10414.47s]  itching my nose.
[10414.47s -> 10421.25s]  Look at this little lake.
[10421.25s -> 10428.80s]  We can go this way.
[10428.80s -> 10432.90s]  Tire swing. I also just wish the characters
[10432.90s -> 10434.90s]  didn't walk around like they have sandbags on their shoes.
[10457.20s -> 10459.57s]  What's it doing here?
[10459.57s -> 10462.26s]  I lived in Little Hope when I was 10.
[10462.26s -> 10465.40s]  I mean,
[10465.40s -> 10467.40s]  there's a lot of wacky shit going on.
[10467.40s -> 10470.79s]  How would I not believe this?
[10484.95s -> 10487.49s]  Oh, you don't look alright.
[10492.12s -> 10494.12s]  No, it's alright. We both got
[10494.12s -> 10496.68s]  Lore snatched this time.
[10502.68s -> 10504.68s]  And it went bad.
[10516.68s -> 10518.68s]  Oh, it was just hysteria.
[10527.92s -> 10529.92s]  They're going to have a face.
[10535.12s -> 10537.12s]  I don't think we can do anything.
[10539.12s -> 10547.96s]  I didn't get a decision.
[10547.96s -> 10549.96s]  I think that she just dies.
[10549.96s -> 10557.32s]  But isn't that my character?
[10557.32s -> 10559.32s]  Yeah, but remember, Judy died.
[10559.32s -> 10562.45s]  What?
[10562.45s -> 10566.04s]  Yeah, but I got an option to like
[10566.04s -> 10568.04s]  step in or do something.
[10568.04s -> 10570.04s]  Oh.
[10570.04s -> 10572.04s]  Like say something.
[10572.04s -> 10574.66s]  Final death
[10574.66s -> 10578.61s]  of premonition.
[10578.61s -> 10580.61s]  I didn't get a promise.
[10580.61s -> 10582.61s]  By the way, it's actually
[10582.61s -> 10584.85s]  they told us to cooperate.
[10584.85s -> 10587.22s]  So I'm going to cooperate.
[10587.22s -> 10589.22s]  It's not me. It's you.
[10589.22s -> 10591.22s]  OK.
[10591.22s -> 10593.22s]  We didn't switch characters.
[10593.22s -> 10595.59s]  Actually, it's probably just both of us.
[10595.59s -> 10597.59s]  We're probably just all going to get visited.
[10597.59s -> 10599.59s]  Sure. We're all going to get a visit
[10599.59s -> 10601.59s]  from the devil.
[10601.59s -> 10603.59s]  I saw the spike from the monster
[10603.59s -> 10605.59s]  about to go into your face.
[10605.59s -> 10607.59s]  You did?
[10607.59s -> 10609.83s]  Yeah. What?
[10609.83s -> 10612.24s]  Hey, wait, wait, wait. Cat. Cat.
[10612.24s -> 10616.84s]  We got a cat over here.
[10616.84s -> 10619.52s]  Can somebody call like animal control?
[10619.52s -> 10622.60s]  Over here. Well, no, we can't.
[10622.60s -> 10624.84s]  Obviously, we can't catch it.
[10624.84s -> 10626.84s]  Feels like we're being followed.
[10626.84s -> 10628.84s]  We are being followed.
[10628.84s -> 10630.84s]  By you.
[10630.84s -> 10633.14s]  Get the fuck out of here.
[10633.14s -> 10635.32s]  That'll work.
[10635.32s -> 10637.32s]  Fuck off. Get the fuck out of here, dude.
[10637.32s -> 10639.62s]  Don't we have a knife?
[10639.62s -> 10642.24s]  Oh, my God.
[10642.24s -> 10644.48s]  Do we
[10644.48s -> 10646.48s]  What do we do? Do we?
[10646.48s -> 10648.48s]  I don't know. You tell me.
[10648.48s -> 10653.41s]  We're going to run. We're going to run.
[10653.41s -> 10655.41s]  What? You don't even tell me
[10655.41s -> 10663.86s]  I got that wrong.
[10663.86s -> 10675.89s]  Are you leaving me? No.
[10675.89s -> 10687.03s]  I'm good. I don't know why, but for a second
[10687.03s -> 10689.03s]  I thought you just had socks on.
[10689.03s -> 10692.04s]  I was like, why do you have shoes on?
[10692.04s -> 10698.50s]  Damn, dude.
[10698.50s -> 10700.93s]  All right. I'm catching up.
[10700.93s -> 10703.62s]  We're good.
[10703.62s -> 10705.62s]  We just keep seeing like the feet.
[10705.62s -> 10707.62s]  Can we see the face?
[10707.62s -> 10710.12s]  That one was quick.
[10710.12s -> 10712.12s]  This one's hard, dude. Be careful.
[10712.12s -> 10727.52s]  Oh, yeah.
[10727.52s -> 10729.52s]  It's not going to last. This road goes in a loop.
[10729.52s -> 10731.52s]  Like, where are we going to go?
[10731.52s -> 10737.09s]  Is that Taylor?
[10737.09s -> 10740.87s]  The floating pair of legs.
[10740.87s -> 10744.26s]  Taylor! Is that you back there?
[10744.26s -> 10746.56s]  Get to the church! Run!
[10746.56s -> 10748.87s]  Watch out. It's like
[10748.87s -> 10750.87s]  somebody turned on god mode, but it's backfiring.
[10752.87s -> 10755.36s]  Hey!
[10755.36s -> 10757.36s]  What are those fucking things after us?
[10757.36s -> 10759.36s]  You're going to sacrifice that guy.
[10759.36s -> 10761.36s]  Leave him! Leave him!
[10761.36s -> 10763.60s]  Get inside!
[10763.60s -> 10765.60s]  Does he not see it?
[10765.60s -> 10768.68s]  I'm going to go help him, dude.
[10768.68s -> 10770.68s]  Go get him. Go get him.
[10770.68s -> 10779.36s]  Gun! Watch out!
[10779.36s -> 10781.36s]  What?
[10781.36s -> 10783.36s]  Did you do that?
[10783.36s -> 10787.76s]  Get in here.
[10787.76s -> 10789.76s]  Did I miss?
[10789.76s -> 10791.76s]  Oh, now you come in after we shoot the gun.
[10795.16s -> 10797.16s]  I just turned the shoes off right in the fucking head.
[10797.16s -> 10799.72s]  Shit!
[10799.72s -> 10801.72s]  Come on, we need a barricade here.
[10801.72s -> 10803.72s]  No, I didn't miss. I just shot at it.
[10803.72s -> 10812.23s]  Wait, is that...
[10812.23s -> 10814.47s]  Wait, we barricaded this guy out?
[10814.47s -> 10816.47s]  We got to let this guy in. Take the barricade off.
[10816.47s -> 10822.16s]  Are we serious?
[10822.16s -> 10827.35s]  Magic feathers.
[10827.35s -> 10829.35s]  Whatever he's up to, we can't trust him.
[10829.35s -> 10831.35s]  I know you're inside.
[10831.35s -> 10833.35s]  It's a lore feather.
[10833.35s -> 10835.52s]  What in god's name is he up to?
[10835.52s -> 10837.52s]  He's going to leave that thing straight to us.
[10837.52s -> 10839.52s]  He doesn't get how much trouble we're in here.
[10839.52s -> 10841.52s]  Aaron, look me in the eye.
[10841.52s -> 10843.70s]  Don't even think about going outside.
[10843.70s -> 10845.70s]  You motherfucker, you. You take a god damn shot at me.
[10845.70s -> 10847.70s]  Oh, there's a monster.
[10847.70s -> 10849.70s]  We have to get rid of him.
[10849.70s -> 10851.70s]  We're in deep shit if that thing hears us.
[10851.70s -> 10853.88s]  What are you talking about?
[10853.88s -> 10857.78s]  That guy...
[10857.78s -> 10859.78s]  Are we in different lore or the same one?
[10859.78s -> 10861.78s]  Go. You're in real danger.
[10861.78s -> 10863.78s]  I know. From you.
[10863.78s -> 10865.78s]  You'll regret it big time if you don't leave right now.
[10865.78s -> 10869.78s]  Get out here and face me like a man, you chicken shit.
[10869.78s -> 10873.78s]  Listen, you need to go before something very bad happens.
[10873.78s -> 10875.78s]  You're threatening me? You got no balls, man.
[10875.78s -> 10877.78s]  You'll never be anything.
[10877.78s -> 10879.78s]  Why can't I just say hey?
[10879.78s -> 10882.72s]  He's trying to like...
[10882.72s -> 10886.76s]  Good job at things out there.
[10886.76s -> 10891.68s]  We're not together, right?
[10891.68s -> 10894.37s]  It's doing with us. Doesn't feel right.
[10894.37s -> 10896.37s]  Shutting that old guy out there.
[10896.37s -> 10898.74s]  It was that or risk all of us getting killed.
[10898.74s -> 10901.43s]  I made the right call.
[10901.43s -> 10904.93s]  Who said it was your call to make, dude?
[10904.93s -> 10909.28s]  This guy thinks he's making calls.
[10909.28s -> 10913.52s]  He wants to hook up with the ghost version of his dead...
[10913.52s -> 10915.52s]  Was that his sister or wife?
[10915.52s -> 10917.52s]  I don't know.
[10917.52s -> 10923.94s]  We're in the same room watching different movies on opposite TVs in the room.
[10923.94s -> 10927.57s]  It's me. I'm next.
[10927.57s -> 10930.71s]  Yeah, that's what I said.
[10930.71s -> 10932.71s]  Who knew that the ghost could be kept out just by blocking a door?
[10932.71s -> 10934.71s]  Whatever.
[10934.71s -> 10937.59s]  Meet accusations against my double.
[10937.59s -> 10939.59s]  Sounded serious.
[10939.59s -> 10942.58s]  We're in church.
[10942.58s -> 10944.82s]  Not this time. It sure looked like it was heading that way.
[10946.32s -> 10948.32s]  I'm surprised he lasted this long.
[10961.20s -> 10964.69s]  I love how the time they need to process language.
[10964.69s -> 10966.69s]  It's so funny.
[10966.69s -> 10968.69s]  I love it.
[10972.00s -> 10974.00s]  I think we have to stay here because it's a church.
[10974.00s -> 10976.00s]  Hey, grab the cross.
[10984.78s -> 10986.78s]  What if you're right? What then?
[10986.78s -> 10990.78s]  If we can stop her, it could prevent any more harm happening to our doubles.
[10990.78s -> 10993.02s]  Okay.
[10993.02s -> 10995.02s]  It happened 300 years ago.
[10995.02s -> 10997.02s]  They're dead either way.
[10997.02s -> 11001.02s]  Yeah, I guess I'm kind of confused as to what the fuck is even happening in this story.
[11001.02s -> 11003.32s]  So these are our doubles, but it's us.
[11003.32s -> 11006.32s]  Like our ancestors or just us?
[11006.32s -> 11010.16s]  I don't know.
[11010.16s -> 11014.13s]  Tripping through time.
[11014.13s -> 11016.13s]  What if those are like the actual stunt doubles?
[11016.13s -> 11019.12s]  Yeah.
[11019.12s -> 11021.12s]  For like the motion capture.
[11021.12s -> 11023.12s]  Changing the past.
[11023.12s -> 11025.12s]  Yeah. I don't know.
[11025.12s -> 11035.67s]  Hey, kid. You out here?
[11035.67s -> 11042.90s]  Are we in the bell tower?
[11042.90s -> 11047.44s]  I don't know. Are you Andrew?
[11047.44s -> 11049.44s]  Am I Andrew or are you Daniel?
[11049.44s -> 11051.44s]  I'm Daniel or Andrew.
[11051.44s -> 11053.68s]  I'm up here too.
[11053.68s -> 11057.72s]  Law grab.
[11057.72s -> 11064.44s]  Sick.
[11064.44s -> 11066.44s]  Did you get law grab too?
[11066.44s -> 11069.00s]  Yeah, I'm here too.
[11069.00s -> 11071.00s]  They had to split it up into two chapters here.
[11071.00s -> 11075.92s]  It pains me to say these words.
[11075.92s -> 11077.92s]  Just push him out the window.
[11077.92s -> 11079.92s]  Your punishment today will protect us all.
[11079.92s -> 11081.92s]  Keep our town safe.
[11081.92s -> 11083.92s]  Why haven't we tried to touch anybody yet?
[11083.92s -> 11086.29s]  We did, actually.
[11086.29s -> 11088.29s]  When I was Daniel, I grabbed somebody and they said,
[11088.29s -> 11090.29s]  I froze.
[11090.29s -> 11092.47s]  You please cannot reach him.
[11092.47s -> 11094.47s]  My fate is not a memory you should carry.
[11094.47s -> 11096.77s]  Who will be my keeper if you are gone?
[11096.77s -> 11098.77s]  You should have thought about that before you killed him.
[11098.77s -> 11101.08s]  He will be your keeper.
[11101.08s -> 11103.08s]  The decision not all are in agreement with.
[11103.08s -> 11107.75s]  Every man will face his day of judgment.
[11107.75s -> 11109.75s]  Yours is today.
[11109.75s -> 11111.75s]  No!
[11111.75s -> 11113.75s]  I almost missed that QTE.
[11113.75s -> 11115.75s]  You see, that's what I did.
[11115.75s -> 11117.75s]  It was a hair.
[11117.75s -> 11119.75s]  I didn't know there was going to be one.
[11119.75s -> 11121.75s]  CE is no longer of this earth.
[11123.75s -> 11125.75s]  He's being held by nothing?
[11125.75s -> 11127.75s]  He's being held up by nothing, but you're not here.
[11127.75s -> 11129.75s]  Oh, I get it.
[11129.75s -> 11131.75s]  It's a spirit.
[11131.75s -> 11133.99s]  That's the knife.
[11133.99s -> 11136.36s]  I didn't get a QTE.
[11136.36s -> 11139.81s]  I didn't either.
[11139.81s -> 11143.72s]  But it's like the guy died in the prologue.
[11143.72s -> 11145.72s]  It's the fire.
[11145.72s -> 11147.72s]  Wait, did you get a QTE? I don't know if I should trust you.
[11147.72s -> 11149.72s]  Did you get a QTE?
[11149.72s -> 11151.72s]  No, I swear to god I didn't get a QTE.
[11151.72s -> 11157.72s]  I am so dead laser focused on QTEs now because of the intentional throw.
[11157.72s -> 11159.72s]  You're right.
[11159.72s -> 11161.72s]  I'm laser focused on QTEs because of that.
[11161.72s -> 11163.72s]  My reputation is forever tarnished.
[11163.72s -> 11171.08s]  I have to try to build it back up.
[11171.08s -> 11173.25s]  Chad is all saying you're sus right now.
[11173.25s -> 11175.25s]  No, I didn't have a QTE.
[11175.25s -> 11178.00s]  I swear to god, go watch the VOD.
[11178.00s -> 11180.00s]  No, I'm not going to watch your VOD.
[11180.00s -> 11184.55s]  I'm playing the game. I'm here.
[11184.55s -> 11193.11s]  Don't you want to see my perspective?
[11193.11s -> 11197.11s]  There won't be any more VODs once we get timed up for that song in the prologue.
[11201.11s -> 11203.11s]  Holy shit, that was incredibly condescending and horrible.
[11203.11s -> 11205.11s]  That was terrible.
[11205.11s -> 11207.11s]  I didn't know it was going to be that 100 miles per hour.
[11207.11s -> 11209.11s]  I'm just going to go along with it.
[11209.11s -> 11213.20s]  What are my member benefits?
[11213.20s -> 11215.20s]  I'm not dead.
[11215.20s -> 11217.20s]  He is beanie.
[11217.20s -> 11219.20s]  Don't bury me.
[11219.20s -> 11221.20s]  That's quite the response.
[11221.20s -> 11223.64s]  Why did that kid Mary want us to see her brother executed?
[11223.64s -> 11229.59s]  Daniel, you're wicked high right now.
[11229.59s -> 11234.45s]  Come on.
[11234.45s -> 11236.45s]  We're missing a piece of the puzzle somehow.
[11236.45s -> 11238.63s]  Like what?
[11238.63s -> 11241.32s]  Not sure.
[11241.32s -> 11245.84s]  First time I saw Mary, I felt like I recognized her from some place.
[11245.84s -> 11247.84s]  Me too.
[11247.84s -> 11250.15s]  I know I've seen her before.
[11250.15s -> 11253.48s]  You don't know where you've seen Mary?
[11253.48s -> 11255.48s]  No, the fire.
[11255.48s -> 11257.48s]  We all were in the same house.
[11257.48s -> 11259.48s]  Maybe we don't remember that.
[11259.48s -> 11261.48s]  Maybe we don't know that.
[11261.48s -> 11263.48s]  Maybe that was like another past self or something.
[11263.48s -> 11265.48s]  Like a future self.
[11265.48s -> 11267.48s]  I don't know.
[11267.48s -> 11269.48s]  Listen, this ghost has no access to their arms and legs.
[11269.48s -> 11271.48s]  Just stay somewhere where they can't fly to you and you'll be fine.
[11273.48s -> 11276.29s]  What do we do now with that thing outside?
[11276.29s -> 11278.29s]  Quiet.
[11278.29s -> 11283.14s]  Quiet.
[11283.14s -> 11285.51s]  It's out there.
[11285.51s -> 11287.51s]  It's out there for now.
[11287.51s -> 11289.51s]  We all died in the fire.
[11289.51s -> 11291.51s]  We all died in the car crash.
[11291.51s -> 11293.51s]  We're making history right from 300 years ago.
[11293.51s -> 11295.51s]  I have no idea.
[11295.51s -> 11297.51s]  A church? Maybe it can't come in.
[11297.51s -> 11299.51s]  Really? It's a fucking vampire now?
[11299.51s -> 11301.51s]  I'm just saying. This is a solid building.
[11301.51s -> 11303.51s]  He's right. We're safer in here.
[11303.51s -> 11306.39s]  We're staying put.
[11306.39s -> 11310.39s]  Option one. Stay inside where the hanging monster doesn't kill you.
[11310.39s -> 11312.39s]  Or go outside where it could kill you.
[11312.39s -> 11314.39s]  Yeah, why would you leave?
[11314.39s -> 11316.39s]  What to do?
[11316.39s -> 11319.65s]  We are staying in here.
[11319.65s -> 11324.26s]  No choice.
[11324.26s -> 11327.01s]  Okay. Maybe you got a point.
[11327.01s -> 11329.01s]  Perhaps that thing will get bored and take off.
[11329.01s -> 11331.01s]  We have nowhere else to go.
[11331.01s -> 11333.64s]  What happened to the dude outside?
[11333.64s -> 11337.48s]  Where's, um...
[11337.48s -> 11340.04s]  Aren't we missing somebody?
[11340.04s -> 11342.04s]  No, not the old lady. I know she's dead.
[11342.04s -> 11345.04s]  No, it's just these four.
[11345.04s -> 11347.04s]  Besides the windows, out of all the buildings
[11347.04s -> 11349.04s]  that we have investigated today,
[11349.04s -> 11351.04s]  this is the A, largest, and B,
[11351.04s -> 11353.04s]  least full of holes building.
[11353.04s -> 11357.38s]  Yeah, it's also...
[11357.38s -> 11359.38s]  Okay, I take that back.
[11359.38s -> 11363.09s]  There's some holes.
[11363.09s -> 11371.80s]  I miss her every day.
[11376.45s -> 11381.89s]  This place keeps getting weirder.
[11381.89s -> 11385.67s]  It was a school.
[11385.67s -> 11387.84s]  Church. What's in the church?
[11387.84s -> 11394.63s]  What is Andrew looking at over here?
[11394.63s -> 11401.03s]  Go find the Bible. Go do a sermon.
[11401.03s -> 11403.27s]  Sounds like more than one.
[11403.27s -> 11405.27s]  Uh-oh, found something.
[11405.27s -> 11407.44s]  It's the guy. He got locked out.
[11407.44s -> 11410.39s]  He's trying to get in.
[11410.39s -> 11417.04s]  Somebody let him in.
[11417.04s -> 11419.04s]  It's not the guy.
[11419.04s -> 11422.63s]  It's the harpoon lady.
[11422.63s -> 11424.63s]  Why did we all run outside immediately
[11424.63s -> 11426.63s]  to stay away from the windows?
[11426.63s -> 11429.51s]  Quick, go out there and get close.
[11429.51s -> 11436.87s]  Oh, that's not good.
[11436.87s -> 11438.87s]  We're all in the mist again.
[11438.87s -> 11446.04s]  They broke a window and we all bailed.
[11446.04s -> 11448.04s]  Alright, I think this is a mute opportunity.
[11448.04s -> 11453.67s]  We are alone.
[11453.67s -> 11465.04s]  What the fuck was that?
[11465.04s -> 11467.04s]  You just have to walk forward until whatever it is
[11467.04s -> 11474.72s]  tries to kill you.
[11474.72s -> 11479.96s]  Pig? Heard pig noise.
[11479.96s -> 11481.96s]  Get ready for the QTE. You have no idea
[11481.96s -> 11485.92s]  how ready I am.
[11485.92s -> 11489.19s]  It's going to be like a hundred...
[11491.67s -> 11493.67s]  Somebody just got hit in the head by a 2x4.
[11493.67s -> 11496.10s]  Or like a wrench.
[11496.10s -> 11498.92s]  I hope Italics is okay.
[11498.92s -> 11500.92s]  I'm not... Just keep muted.
[11500.92s -> 11504.50s]  I'm just playing.
[11504.50s -> 11510.58s]  I really hope that Italics is okay.
[11510.58s -> 11517.36s]  What am I doing?
[11517.36s -> 11519.73s]  Oh, fuck.
[11519.73s -> 11521.73s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[11521.73s -> 11524.29s]  Oh, no.
[11524.29s -> 11526.29s]  Oh, no, no, no. What do I do? Which one?
[11526.29s -> 11538.18s]  I'm going left. Fuck.
[11538.18s -> 11540.18s]  Who's wrong?
[11540.18s -> 11543.96s]  Oh, shit. What do I do?
[11543.96s -> 11546.52s]  QTE.
[11546.52s -> 11548.52s]  I got a knife.
[11548.52s -> 11550.52s]  Thank God I gave the knife back.
[11550.52s -> 11553.78s]  Did I stab myself with the knife?
[11553.78s -> 11558.52s]  Thank God I gave the fucking knife back.
[11558.52s -> 11560.52s]  No, you take the knife. No, you take the knife.
[11560.52s -> 11562.95s]  Turns out it was a fucking thousand IQ play.
[11570.69s -> 11574.02s]  I'm not John. I'm in trouble.
[11574.02s -> 11576.77s]  I'm not John.
[11576.77s -> 11585.54s]  What was that?
[11585.54s -> 11587.54s]  That was the John Travolta.
[11587.54s -> 11589.54s]  What happened? What room am I in?
[11589.54s -> 11591.54s]  Oh, yeah. Shit just went down.
[11591.54s -> 11593.54s]  Probably for both of us.
[11593.54s -> 11595.54s]  Yeah. Well, it did. But also like
[11595.54s -> 11597.97s]  the guy I was with disappeared in front of my eyes.
[11597.97s -> 11599.97s]  Like his model vanished.
[11599.97s -> 11601.97s]  It's such a good thing that I gave the knife back to you.
[11601.97s -> 11603.97s]  Otherwise, Taylor is dead if I don't do that.
[11603.97s -> 11605.97s]  Can't stop. No, wait.
[11605.97s -> 11608.47s]  He needs a break.
[11608.47s -> 11610.90s]  Forget it. Those things are coming after us.
[11610.90s -> 11612.90s]  Not you. I also saved John.
[11612.90s -> 11614.90s]  We can't hang around. Good.
[11614.90s -> 11617.83s]  You're John. I saved you.
[11617.83s -> 11619.83s]  Thanks for saving me.
[11619.83s -> 11622.26s]  Stick together and we'll be fine.
[11622.26s -> 11624.26s]  Fine like Angela, right?
[11624.26s -> 11627.65s]  That's a low blow.
[11627.65s -> 11634.48s]  What's our next move?
[11634.48s -> 11643.56s]  I'm not sure.
[11643.56s -> 11645.56s]  Dude, I was getting like almost
[11645.56s -> 11647.56s]  murdered by the monster.
[11647.56s -> 11649.56s]  Were you fighting the hanging monster?
[11649.56s -> 11651.56s]  I was. I was fighting the crawling monster.
[11651.56s -> 11653.56s]  And you popped in while
[11653.56s -> 11655.56s]  there's like a tongue wrapped around my neck
[11655.56s -> 11657.56s]  and I'm fighting for my life and I hear, are you John?
[11657.56s -> 11660.36s]  That's impressive.
[11660.36s -> 11664.37s]  I wish. No way I could get
[11664.37s -> 11666.37s]  any shut eye after what went down tonight.
[11666.37s -> 11672.05s]  Would love to though and be.
[11672.05s -> 11674.05s]  Any ideas how we're getting out of here?
[11674.05s -> 11677.96s]  Why do you always decide where we're going?
[11677.96s -> 11680.76s]  It do end up
[11680.76s -> 11682.76s]  like that, huh? It's clear now.
[11682.76s -> 11685.70s]  There's no help available. We're on our own.
[11685.70s -> 11687.94s]  Sure seems that way.
[11687.94s -> 11689.94s]  Our best shot, maybe our only shot,
[11689.94s -> 11692.44s]  is to stop that girl, Mary.
[11692.44s -> 11694.44s]  Getting to Mary, stopping her
[11694.44s -> 11696.44s]  might help, sure. Okay.
[11696.44s -> 11698.44s]  But what about the other kid?
[11698.44s -> 11700.44s]  The one that keeps running from us.
[11700.44s -> 11702.44s]  Mary and her are connected
[11702.44s -> 11704.44s]  somehow, I'm sure of it.
[11704.44s -> 11706.44s]  Maybe the other girl is trying to lead us somewhere.
[11706.44s -> 11708.44s]  Where? I don't know.
[11708.44s -> 11710.44s]  Maybe to a place we can
[11710.44s -> 11712.44s]  stop all this. We were separated at the beginning
[11712.44s -> 11717.04s]  of the game.
[11717.04s -> 11719.04s]  Mary, the girl
[11719.04s -> 11721.48s]  in the original house
[11721.48s -> 11723.72s]  was complaining about
[11723.72s -> 11725.72s]  no one likes her,
[11725.72s -> 11727.72s]  she's invisible to everyone.
[11727.72s -> 11729.72s]  She also burnt to death.
[11729.72s -> 11731.72s]  You didn't see that part. She literally was
[11731.72s -> 11733.72s]  torched on camera.
[11733.72s -> 11735.72s]  I think this is the power of friendship.
[11735.72s -> 11737.72s]  If we try to kill her, we all die.
[11737.72s -> 11739.72s]  If we owe it to the
[11739.72s -> 11741.72s]  others, be nice to her.
[11741.72s -> 11745.36s]  We all live or something.
[11745.36s -> 11748.12s]  The key to this, I'm certain of it.
[11748.12s -> 11751.44s]  He said it, not me this time.
[11754.84s -> 11758.10s]  It's not that simple.
[11758.10s -> 11760.10s]  Like you said, she's just a kid, we can't
[11760.10s -> 11762.10s]  listen to her. I get it.
[11762.10s -> 11764.10s]  We see her again. We do whatever
[11764.10s -> 11766.10s]  is necessary. There's doubles of each of us.
[11766.10s -> 11768.40s]  Our doubles.
[11768.40s -> 11770.40s]  Keep getting accused of witchcraft.
[11770.40s -> 11772.40s]  Now we're accusing this little kid of witchcraft
[11772.40s -> 11774.40s]  in our timeline. This place is safe though,
[11774.40s -> 11776.40s]  is leaving such a strong idea.
[11776.40s -> 11778.40s]  If we kill her, we do the same thing that killed
[11778.40s -> 11780.40s]  our doubles back in their time.
[11780.40s -> 11782.71s]  Would you look at that?
[11787.65s -> 11789.65s]  But who's doing this power?
[11789.65s -> 11791.65s]  How are we doing this?
[11791.65s -> 11793.65s]  I don't know who's doing the lore grab.
[11793.65s -> 11795.65s]  Who's actually doing the lore grab?
[11795.65s -> 11811.17s]  Me.
[11811.17s -> 11813.17s]  Mr. Lore Grabber, smiley face.
[11813.17s -> 11815.17s]  Oh, yeah.
[11815.17s -> 11821.11s]  Thanks for the tip.
[11825.89s -> 11827.89s]  God damn it.
[11827.89s -> 11829.89s]  Yeah.
[11834.76s -> 11840.64s]  Oh, great.
[11840.64s -> 11842.95s]  Here we go.
[11842.95s -> 11844.95s]  Seriously, that was so fast.
[11844.95s -> 11846.95s]  That was insane.
[11852.92s -> 11854.92s]  How do people trip when they run?
[11857.60s -> 11859.60s]  Why do you trip and land flat on your face
[11859.60s -> 11861.60s]  like you're sliding on a slip and slide?
[11861.60s -> 11863.60s]  People don't know that humans don't do that.
[11863.60s -> 11865.60s]  Are both of your shoes tied together?
[11869.51s -> 11871.94s]  Andrew? You there?
[11871.94s -> 11881.16s]  Daniel? Who are you?
[11881.16s -> 11884.61s]  Alright, we're gonna have to mute.
[11884.61s -> 11886.61s]  I think I'm right next to you, actually.
[11886.61s -> 11888.61s]  Wait, didn't this just happen?
[11891.62s -> 11893.62s]  Oh, they're telltale-ing me.
[11893.62s -> 11895.62s]  You're getting telltale-ed?
[11901.17s -> 11903.17s]  You're saving me?
[11903.17s -> 11907.20s]  Come on, get it out.
[11907.20s -> 11912.45s]  How did I miss? I clicked in it.
[11912.45s -> 11914.45s]  You saw me click in the window.
[11914.45s -> 11916.45s]  Just let me save you,
[11916.45s -> 11918.45s]  I clicked in the window.
[11918.45s -> 11920.45s]  I didn't fail that.
[11920.45s -> 11922.45s]  I didn't fail that.
[11922.45s -> 11924.45s]  How did I fail that?
[11924.45s -> 11926.45s]  You go back and you pull that shit back
[11926.45s -> 11928.45s]  and you throw it. I clicked in the circle.
[11928.45s -> 11932.10s]  Take the clip and then slow-mo it.
[11932.10s -> 11934.85s]  I clicked in that circle
[11934.85s -> 11936.85s]  in plenty of fucking time.
[11936.85s -> 11943.89s]  I did not miss.
[11943.89s -> 11945.89s]  I didn't even miss.
[11945.89s -> 11947.89s]  Give me the clip.
[11947.89s -> 11949.89s]  Show me.
[11949.89s -> 11951.89s]  Show me the clip.
[11951.89s -> 11958.42s]  Show me the clip. I want to see it.
[11958.42s -> 11960.42s]  I swear to God I did not miss that QTE.
[11960.42s -> 11962.42s]  I clicked right in the circle with like a half-done.
[11962.42s -> 11969.91s]  Don't shoot yourself in the head.
[11969.91s -> 11971.91s]  Don't shoot yourself in the head, please.
[11971.91s -> 11977.54s]  Okay, wait.
[11977.54s -> 11979.54s]  Don't shoot yourself in the head.
[11979.54s -> 11981.54s]  I thought you shot her.
[11981.54s -> 11985.11s]  The gun.
[11985.11s -> 11987.11s]  Who did you shoot?
[11987.11s -> 11989.11s]  I shot the monster.
[11989.11s -> 11991.11s]  He didn't miss. Look at that.
[11996.53s -> 11998.53s]  Didn't miss.
[12002.24s -> 12004.24s]  No one can doubt that.
[12004.24s -> 12006.24s]  But we need to keep moving
[12006.24s -> 12008.24s]  if we want to get out of this place.
[12008.24s -> 12011.83s]  John.
[12011.83s -> 12013.83s]  Another one just died. A word, please.
[12013.83s -> 12017.16s]  He literally didn't miss.
[12017.16s -> 12019.16s]  Omega Lul. I know.
[12019.16s -> 12021.16s]  I want to watch it.
[12021.16s -> 12023.16s]  Then to win a thousand battles.
[12023.16s -> 12025.16s]  Then the victory is yours.
[12025.16s -> 12027.16s]  It cannot be taken from you.
[12027.16s -> 12029.72s]  Not by angels
[12029.72s -> 12031.72s]  or by demons.
[12031.72s -> 12033.72s]  Heaven or hell.
[12033.72s -> 12037.56s]  Perhaps you've started
[12037.56s -> 12042.29s]  to realize something.
[12042.29s -> 12044.29s]  Uh, yes.
[12044.29s -> 12046.29s]  I can't pause the game.
[12046.29s -> 12051.03s]  Oh, dude, that's a pretty good hand.
[12051.03s -> 12053.03s]  20? Never hit on 20. He just busted.
[12053.03s -> 12055.03s]  I can't click that link, guys.
[12055.03s -> 12057.03s]  I can't.
[12057.03s -> 12059.52s]  May not be quite what they appear to be.
[12059.52s -> 12061.52s]  Oh, he said that in the last game.
[12061.52s -> 12063.52s]  Three executions.
[12063.52s -> 12065.52s]  Three tormented
[12065.52s -> 12068.02s]  beings and two
[12068.02s -> 12071.60s]  lost souls.
[12071.60s -> 12073.60s]  Any thoughts on what might be around the corner?
[12073.60s -> 12075.60s]  Hidden by the fog?
[12075.60s -> 12078.10s]  Ixilandi?
[12078.10s -> 12080.10s]  I don't think that you
[12080.10s -> 12082.10s]  could save them because they're being judged
[12082.10s -> 12084.10s]  for their actions in purgatory
[12084.10s -> 12086.10s]  and they were sent to hell by the demons
[12086.10s -> 12088.10s]  that crawled up them and it was them because
[12088.10s -> 12090.10s]  it was their inner demons and all that shit.
[12090.10s -> 12092.10s]  You were literally in
[12092.10s -> 12096.45s]  the circle.
[12096.45s -> 12098.45s]  Alright, can I, can we, I have to pee
[12098.45s -> 12100.45s]  too. Can I go pee?
[12100.45s -> 12102.45s]  Oh yeah, we can take a pee break. Let's take a pee break.
[12102.45s -> 12104.45s]  And I want to show this on stream. I'll be back in two minutes.
[12104.45s -> 12106.45s]  I'll be back in, uh, I need to
[12106.45s -> 12108.45s]  take five because I gotta take the dog out. Oh, okay.
[12108.45s -> 12111.46s]  Yeah. Take five.
[12111.46s -> 12114.60s]  Alright, let me see this fucking link.
[12114.60s -> 12116.60s]  Let me see. How, you show me. I want to see.
[12116.60s -> 12120.63s]  No fucking way.
[12120.63s -> 12122.80s]  Get the hell out of here. This is bullshit.
[12122.80s -> 12125.62s]  How is that, how is that not the circle?
[12125.62s -> 12145.25s]  Are you serious?
[12145.25s -> 12147.88s]  That's where I clicked. That's in the circle.
[12147.88s -> 12149.88s]  That's in the, that's the circle.
[12149.88s -> 12159.35s]  That's in the circle.
[12159.35s -> 12161.78s]  Look at that. You see where the white ends?
[12161.78s -> 12164.15s]  The white ends, it's right in that
[12164.15s -> 12166.15s]  inner lip in there.
[12166.15s -> 12168.58s]  That constitutes as a click in the circle.
[12168.58s -> 12175.49s]  It's not outside the circle. Outside the circle
[12175.49s -> 12177.49s]  would be outside that outer ring.
[12177.49s -> 12191.51s]  That is one pixel.
[12191.51s -> 12193.51s]  The life and death of Daniel.
[12193.51s -> 12204.24s]  Sharpen the fuck out of this.
[12204.24s -> 12214.15s]  Or sharpen. Excuse me.
[12214.15s -> 12216.39s]  That's inside that inner lip.
[12216.39s -> 12228.10s]  Enhance it. It's outside the
[12228.10s -> 12230.10s]  inner circle. But it's inside
[12230.10s -> 12232.10s]  the outer circle by a lot.
[12232.10s -> 12234.72s]  The tip is on the, right on the edge.
[12234.72s -> 12242.26s]  Fucking damn it.
[12242.26s -> 12244.26s]  Alright, alright. But you have to
[12244.26s -> 12246.26s]  look, I tried.
[12246.26s -> 12248.26s]  That wasn't like a, oh I fucking clicked
[12248.26s -> 12255.17s]  red, red, red.
[12255.17s -> 12257.17s]  Alright, I'm gonna go pee. God damn it.
[12257.17s -> 12259.17s]  One pixel. I'm so...
[12259.17s -> 12261.48s]  I could have saved that character.
[12261.48s -> 12274.96s]  Alright, I'll be right back.
[12274.96s -> 12276.96s]  It's inside that fucking circle.
[12276.96s -> 12362.07s]  I'm telling you.
[12372.84s -> 12379.04s]  As my first order of business,
[12379.04s -> 12381.67s]  as new king of the rats,
[12381.67s -> 12385.06s]  I will mod the first ten
[12385.06s -> 12388.52s]  people who talk, starting now.
[12388.52s -> 12391.97s]  And then ban the next ten.
[12391.97s -> 12406.80s]  Choose wisely. Hey,
[12406.80s -> 12408.80s]  Germachat, if you're so cool, how come I can't see
[12408.80s -> 12414.88s]  what you're writing right now? That's what I thought.
[12414.88s -> 12416.88s]  How come someone who can't even see
[12416.88s -> 12419.32s]  your chat can bait you into
[12419.32s -> 12428.92s]  typing in your chat? Easily manipulated.
[12428.92s -> 12438.45s]  Anyway, to my chat,
[12438.45s -> 12440.82s]  who is far more
[12440.82s -> 12442.82s]  attractive and
[12442.82s -> 12445.19s]  patient and kind and loving?
[12447.75s -> 12452.29s]  Hello, my chat.
[12452.29s -> 12456.76s]  Talking shit? What's he doing?
[12456.76s -> 12458.76s]  What'd he say? I just heard a lot of noise coming through the headphones.
[12458.76s -> 12463.92s]  What'd he say?
[12463.92s -> 12465.92s]  Was he talking shit?
[12465.92s -> 12468.23s]  What?
[12468.23s -> 12470.47s]  By the way, did you see the image?
[12470.47s -> 12472.47s]  I don't know if you saw the image that's been circulating.
[12472.47s -> 12474.47s]  About the clicking inside the...
[12474.47s -> 12477.03s]  I was in the circle.
[12477.03s -> 12479.65s]  Can you link it to me?
[12479.65s -> 12484.13s]  Yeah, here. Take a look at this.
[12484.13s -> 12490.47s]  Uh, where is it?
[12490.47s -> 12493.86s]  Someone give it to me. Yeah, it's been circulating on like
[12493.86s -> 12495.86s]  the internet and shit. Why is my chat
[12495.86s -> 12497.86s]  saying you were not in the circle? I was.
[12497.86s -> 12500.04s]  Very clearly. Take a look.
[12500.04s -> 12502.04s]  Alright, I want you to just take a look at that
[12502.04s -> 12508.56s]  and tell me that's not in the circle.
[12508.56s -> 12510.56s]  Would you constitute that as like being it being in the circle?
[12510.56s -> 12515.88s]  Or would you say that's out of the circle?
[12515.88s -> 12518.63s]  I gotta enhance. I did
[12518.63s -> 12521.44s]  that too? Hold on, one sec.
[12521.44s -> 12524.82s]  You're on like
[12524.82s -> 12528.79s]  the outline of the circle
[12528.79s -> 12530.79s]  is definitely not inside the
[12530.79s -> 12532.79s]  circle though. That still should be
[12532.79s -> 12535.73s]  a plus. Like you did
[12535.73s -> 12537.73s]  it. That should be an acceptable point.
[12537.73s -> 12539.73s]  Did you know that I haven't missed a circle yet
[12539.73s -> 12542.10s]  with my thumbsticks on a
[12542.10s -> 12544.10s]  controller? Yeah, cause you're console aiming.
[12544.10s -> 12546.10s]  I'm on the hard one. I'm on PC.
[12546.10s -> 12548.98s]  You have auto aim assist on console. I don't
[12548.98s -> 12551.48s]  have that. Hey, there's
[12551.48s -> 12553.48s]  no aim assist.
[12553.48s -> 12555.48s]  All console controller gaming
[12555.48s -> 12559.00s]  has aim assist. Of course it does. I'm doing
[12559.00s -> 12561.00s]  it like eye to eye, one to one. Like eye tracking
[12561.00s -> 12564.24s]  is hard. Anyways, hold on, give me one sec.
[12564.24s -> 12566.24s]  Somebody gave 50 bucks.
[12566.24s -> 12569.57s]  Who just gave 5,000 bits? Is this PUBG
[12569.57s -> 12571.57s]  mobile gamer really gonna lecture me on auto
[12571.57s -> 12573.57s]  aim? He doesn't know he's muted.
[12573.57s -> 12576.82s]  Who just gave 5,000
[12576.82s -> 12578.82s]  bits? I missed it. It's not showing up
[12578.82s -> 12589.38s]  anywhere. Wait, there's a straw poll about
[12589.38s -> 12595.06s]  this? What does it say?
[12595.06s -> 12597.36s]  There's a straw poll. 66
[12597.36s -> 12599.36s]  percent said I missed. 34 percent
[12599.36s -> 12602.29s]  said I didn't miss. Well,
[12602.29s -> 12606.13s]  I think those are pretty good considering.
[12606.13s -> 12608.13s]  33 percent or 30
[12608.13s -> 12611.27s]  power of many. That's a lot. Yeah, that's a lot
[12611.27s -> 12615.75s]  of suck ups.
[12615.75s -> 12617.75s]  You do realize this is Twitch chat.
[12617.75s -> 12619.75s]  If this was accurate.
[12619.75s -> 12621.75s]  Yeah, but I'm with the majority, so I
[12621.75s -> 12623.75s]  chose correctly. But if this
[12623.75s -> 12625.75s]  were truly... 66 percent have my back
[12625.75s -> 12627.75s]  and like 34 percent have yours.
[12627.75s -> 12629.75s]  So I'll take those odds. Yeah, but if
[12629.75s -> 12631.75s]  this were truly Twitch chat and I truly missed,
[12631.75s -> 12633.75s]  wouldn't it be like 5 percent?
[12633.75s -> 12637.59s]  No? Wouldn't everybody be like, oh yeah, he fucking
[12637.59s -> 12639.59s]  missed. Fuck this guy, it sucks.
[12639.59s -> 12643.54s]  That's what I think would happen. They just want to be noticed.
[12643.54s -> 12646.61s]  Alright, there was a huge donation
[12646.61s -> 12648.61s]  and I don't see it anywhere. I don't know why.
[12648.61s -> 12651.43s]  Well, they definitely want to be noticed.
[12651.43s -> 12656.98s]  Why can I not see this? I'll catch you at the end of this stream.
[12656.98s -> 12658.98s]  I don't know why I can't see it anywhere.
[12658.98s -> 12660.98s]  He didn't notice you. Was it fake money?
[12660.98s -> 12663.28s]  Alright, you ready? Ready to get
[12663.28s -> 12665.28s]  back into this? You do ready.
[12665.28s -> 12667.28s]  You do ready first, like we said before.
[12667.28s -> 12671.19s]  There we go. Perfect.
[12671.19s -> 12673.73s]  Beautiful. Alright, let's go.
[12673.73s -> 12675.73s]  Three, two, one, action.
[12675.73s -> 12684.82s]  Keep a lookout for the girl.
[12684.82s -> 12687.12s]  We have to stop her. Did you pee
[12687.12s -> 12689.12s]  on the toilet room and say you hit inside
[12689.12s -> 12691.12s]  the bowl?
[12691.12s -> 12693.12s]  Nice.
[12693.12s -> 12696.07s]  There's another path here if you wanted it.
[12696.07s -> 12698.07s]  Another path? Wait, who are you?
[12698.07s -> 12700.50s]  I'm Jon. Oh yeah, there was another path.
[12700.50s -> 12708.55s]  They may go the same way.
[12708.55s -> 12710.55s]  There's three of us here. Who are you?
[12710.55s -> 12714.58s]  Hang on, hang on. Pause the game.
[12714.58s -> 12717.72s]  What? What? I still have
[12717.72s -> 12719.72s]  your circle as like an enhanced
[12719.72s -> 12721.72s]  image. I have to
[12721.72s -> 12723.72s]  change the scene and then
[12723.72s -> 12726.60s]  yeah, okay.
[12726.60s -> 12730.29s]  Alright, let's move.
[12730.29s -> 12739.76s]  Dude, I got this iced tea from
[12739.76s -> 12741.76s]  Target. It's the greatest shit ever.
[12741.76s -> 12745.09s]  It's like iced tea concentrate.
[12745.09s -> 12753.48s]  It's like my favorite thing on Earth.
[12753.48s -> 12762.12s]  You need to dilute it.
[12762.12s -> 12764.12s]  No, I do, yeah. You do 50-50
[12764.12s -> 12766.12s]  water. It's what, the Tazo
[12766.12s -> 12768.61s]  tea? There's a passion fruit and
[12768.61s -> 12770.61s]  there's a green peach.
[12770.61s -> 12772.79s]  You do 50-50 into water. Oh,
[12772.79s -> 12774.79s]  it's unbelievable. It's the best. It's great.
[12774.79s -> 12778.88s]  Dangerous unstable structure
[12778.88s -> 12787.01s]  ahead. There's a lot of fireflies
[12787.01s -> 12789.01s]  around this mystical door.
[12789.01s -> 12793.30s]  Yeah, there is, isn't there?
[12793.30s -> 12799.12s]  Yeah, unstable structure.
[12799.12s -> 12802.58s]  What is that light?
[12802.58s -> 12804.58s]  Looks kind of beautiful, don't you think?
[12804.58s -> 12806.58s]  Don't go towards the light
[12806.58s -> 12809.01s]  here. Yeah, that's when your eyes
[12809.01s -> 12811.01s]  are glazed over and you're under a spell.
[12811.01s -> 12813.01s]  Lore grab.
[12813.01s -> 12817.43s]  Sick.
[12817.43s -> 12819.43s]  Dude, that was a lore grab out of nowhere.
[12819.43s -> 12823.52s]  Play his fucking entrance
[12823.52s -> 12825.96s]  music.
[12825.96s -> 12827.96s]  What ails you, my friend?
[12827.96s -> 12830.32s]  Goku instant
[12830.32s -> 12832.32s]  transmission.
[12862.87s -> 12865.68s]  Oh, yeah.
[12888.36s -> 12890.36s]  Why take out Merry and not like the guy
[12890.36s -> 12892.36s]  listening to her? We were just
[12892.36s -> 12894.36s]  standing over there, by the way.
[12894.36s -> 12896.36s]  I thought this was supposed to be us. Wait,
[12896.36s -> 12898.36s]  why are we just standing?
[12898.36s -> 12900.36s]  Yeah, but like why are we so weirdly
[12900.36s -> 12902.36s]  standing?
[12924.64s -> 12926.64s]  Oh yeah,
[12926.64s -> 12928.64s]  I was gonna say the same thing.
[12928.64s -> 12930.64s]  Every swear word combined.
[12930.64s -> 12932.88s]  Screaming as loud as you can.
[12932.88s -> 12934.88s]  Oh fuck, what do we do?
[12934.88s -> 12937.19s]  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
[12960.02s -> 12967.62s]  Little hope is no longer. That's how he's already seeing spirits strange and disturbing events have become wrong. No. I'm right a little too late you
[12968.54s -> 12971.74s]  Tell us do you find that to be a bad response one of these no?
[12971.74s -> 12975.06s]  I thought it was I would said feeling the same thing we talked about yeah
[12975.06s -> 12980.20s]  We're my friend, but it does not sit easily with me that in doing so I condemn a child
[12981.22s -> 12988.92s]  Putting it all on a kid isn't right the priest is the one driving this whole thing
[12989.52s -> 12991.86s]  Reverend Carver is a man guided by God
[12992.66s -> 12994.66s]  No one can doubt that
[12994.82s -> 12997.70s]  I'm I support you
[12999.40s -> 13005.42s]  cooperate
[13005.74s -> 13017.55s]  Second I don't know what's right or wrong anymore. Nothing here makes sense. Hi Taylor. Let's you join us
[13018.15s -> 13020.15s]  Let's just show up. I
[13020.31s -> 13028.48s]  Enter stage left. Maybe we'll see him again get him to change his mind. I made the right call
[13028.48s -> 13031.16s]  I have no doubts. Yeah, we did
[13031.84s -> 13034.80s]  You made the right call. I made the right call. We both made the right call
[13037.97s -> 13039.97s]  Really not
[13040.45s -> 13045.97s]  This girl has been grabbed around the neck by this monster three or four times
[13047.29s -> 13053.53s]  Wait, do we just not get to do anything? I think I'm just died. Oh
[13058.78s -> 13060.78s]  One pixel
[13060.86s -> 13064.87s]  Taylor where are you?
[13065.03s -> 13072.63s]  What how where are you guys always trust your ears trust your ears always not movement your eyes to see if you ears do not
[13073.19s -> 13090.14s]  You're right. I'm over here
[13090.90s -> 13093.20s]  Found you
[13094.44s -> 13103.14s]  Remember follow your nose your fruit look green apple cherry and strawberry
[13105.17s -> 13107.17s]  Dialogue choice there
[13112.21s -> 13114.21s]  I was pretty weak
[13115.62s -> 13119.78s]  Yeah, that was pretty limp I think better have been really heavy
[13124.06s -> 13129.84s]  This poor girl, I mean seriously, this is like the fourth or fifth time that she gets like smokered from leopard dead
[13130.66s -> 13137.06s]  Yeah, like fucking kiss this lady from the lobby expert mode. Okay, and it's hard to keep up
[13137.06s -> 13140.62s]  No boot from the lobby man. You keep getting grabbed by special effect is fuck out of here
[13140.62s -> 13151.13s]  I want to get to the first safe house. All right. Now. I'm John. I am Andrew
[13158.20s -> 13165.16s]  Honestly after this many times. It's probably not even scary for her anymore. Well that but that's her right?
[13165.16s -> 13167.16s]  So that's why it keeps doing it that to her
[13167.68s -> 13169.68s]  Yeah, I'm going to claim
[13169.76s -> 13171.27s]  her
[13171.27s -> 13178.22s]  Weird looking tree over here. No, I I'm gonna look at the tree. Okay, it's
[13179.18s -> 13189.51s]  It's got the stick bug symbol on it. Okay. She's not even playable anymore
[13189.95s -> 13203.64s]  Yeah, she's kind of not we have to go down or back to the road
[13204.20s -> 13205.24s]  Yeah
[13205.24s -> 13216.49s]  You coming or not? Whatever that thing was I was about to ask where Daniel was and I just remembered
[13219.53s -> 13222.83s]  Daniel is in a better place. What went on back there? No clue
[13223.45s -> 13228.18s]  Whatever we saw back there or thought we saw we're still in grave danger
[13228.98s -> 13234.99s]  You've killed everyone
[13235.43s -> 13248.22s]  To there must be something we can do Mary's in the middle of all this that I'm certain of but what if it doesn't work?
[13248.62s -> 13258.25s]  We don't know for sure that stopping Mary will help us out. It's just a theory
[13258.33s -> 13268.70s]  It may only be a theory, but right now it's all we've got come on
[13268.98s -> 13273.86s]  Let's take a look. You know if I said that I would have gotten minus two for sure all right
[13273.86s -> 13275.86s]  Well that was those were the two more
[13277.61s -> 13279.61s]  Peaceful options. Yeah, those are peaceful
[13288.57s -> 13294.21s]  Hydropraktor hey dude. Hey locked door can't wait to see the locked door and
[13294.53s -> 13299.40s]  I was just watching my character's death. You know it's really funny
[13299.60s -> 13304.46s]  You're the one that's seeing all the ways to prevent the deaths, and I'm the one that's dying
[13304.66s -> 13308.66s]  It's really not like they don't tell me what QTE. I'm gonna have to push
[13308.66s -> 13315.98s]  It's just a visual of them actually dying, but it's nice to know that they come true because then you control the character
[13315.98s -> 13326.31s]  Yeah, so it comes true. The ink is already written. It's dry. I'm not doing anything wrong. You are seeing the future can't be prevented
[13326.31s -> 13343.86s]  It's already happened harvard for mayor by the way if you're curious I get choked out really wait choked out by the monster tongue
[13343.86s -> 13345.86s]  I had a new monster. Oh
[13353.89s -> 13357.11s]  upstairs
[13357.11s -> 13363.15s]  So there is like a dramatic irony in that John was the character we predicted to die first and he may be the only
[13363.15s -> 13378.98s]  Character that survives that's true. Hey up here under the Dave state
[13384.72s -> 13390.86s]  He's back coming. You can't keep running
[13391.74s -> 13393.74s]  I'll make sure they'll find you
[13395.01s -> 13401.21s]  That guy's a menace. We're probably that's how bad a mess. We're in come on. We're like in some weird
[13401.21s -> 13404.56s]  I mean in this guy's defense
[13405.00s -> 13410.92s]  We've just been going around the old town breaking into every single building and like messing shit up
[13411.92s -> 13418.12s]  Please make sure they'll find you. I don't think he's talking about the monsters. We're probably just in some weird purgatory world
[13423.79s -> 13426.35s]  Timing how is my time to speak before the judge?
[13426.83s -> 13434.64s]  Maybe we're finally getting somewhere filled with dread my testimony will be received
[13435.52s -> 13439.34s]  The devil has blinded so many to what is real and what is not
[13440.08s -> 13446.96s]  Nothing good will come. I love this putting on the accent acting to twist the truth allow me to judge. What is true?
[13447.72s -> 13453.48s]  Abraham and joseph are allies in this deception and lest we forget you condemned joseph. He does sound like johnson
[13454.00s -> 13456.00s]  What do you now question that decision?
[13456.32s -> 13462.00s]  I've heard nothing today to sway my conviction joseph consorted with the same malicious force as his wife
[13463.12s -> 13465.72s]  That's because Sean beans accent was so good
[13465.72s -> 13469.20s]  They told all the other actors to imitate him and that's why everyone on game of thrones sounded like that
[13473.08s -> 13475.98s]  That's real Sean beans real accent
[13478.36s -> 13480.92s]  Damn imagine being that good of an actor
[13481.88s -> 13488.40s]  You tell every other fucking actor they're not good enough be more like Sean beam great fortitude to speak out against the evil here
[13489.12s -> 13491.12s]  Many would have lacked her courage
[13491.20s -> 13497.01s]  Yet her reward for exposing this brooding covered in our midst is to be besmirched. Her courage is not in question
[13497.53s -> 13499.89s]  It is her intent. We must be certain of
[13500.85s -> 13504.65s]  Her accuser is the very man entrusted to care for this innocent child
[13505.49s -> 13511.25s]  Plain to see he is not fit for such a task and I would ask the court to have Mary placed elsewhere
[13511.97s -> 13515.05s]  So Andrew double agree you are via a new ward reverend
[13515.81s -> 13517.81s]  Throw the kid under the bus. I guess
[13519.77s -> 13521.77s]  If the court agrees
[13521.85s -> 13526.29s]  First the court must hear what Abraham has to say. No decision could be made on the child until then
[13527.49s -> 13538.68s]  Abraham what am I to do?
[13539.48s -> 13544.24s]  Some would have me speak out against Mary, but could a child truly be capable of such evil
[13544.92s -> 13547.28s]  Sorry, I don't know. What do you know? Oh god. I
[13547.84s -> 13549.24s]  Feel like we're getting
[13549.24s -> 13551.24s]  trick question real
[13552.88s -> 13558.46s]  I understand your dilemma the consequences couldn't be more serious, but the girl is so young
[13563.70s -> 13565.70s]  such evil
[13565.70s -> 13568.54s]  No, the call what you have come here to say
[13569.10s -> 13571.10s]  She's my queen. Speak up boy
[13571.38s -> 13573.68s]  No out with it
[13573.88s -> 13576.61s]  Mary has spoken of evil spirits
[13577.39s -> 13584.07s]  Devilry and witchcraft. I do won't it things many cannot believe could exist here and I'm not here for history and here say
[13586.75s -> 13591.91s]  Mary is tormented don't want to hide really as I was kind of a Thanos there plagued her
[13592.67s -> 13594.47s]  stolen her innocence
[13594.47s -> 13598.56s]  Some suggest she is in league with these creatures, but no one can be certain
[13599.40s -> 13601.00s]  myself least of all
[13601.00s -> 13603.53s]  Can any of us truly know a child's mind?
[13604.29s -> 13610.78s]  You claim I lack the ability to see the truth. I thought that was you talking my beg forgiveness dogs
[13610.78s -> 13615.10s]  I swear to God. I thought that was you doing that such a thing my time is not for wasting you
[13615.10s -> 13620.26s]  I'm the one the priest have me enough for one day. I have more to say I have already given you enough time
[13620.26s -> 13621.74s]  This is you talking
[13621.74s -> 13626.62s]  Furthermore Mary is to be placed into the care of Reverend Carver's now stand down
[13628.58s -> 13636.32s]  That really did sound like you putting on like doing a voice
[13636.88s -> 13643.70s]  He just kind of turned into that that was weird. I believe we have the actor for judge very in Britain
[13643.70s -> 13648.62s]  Whatever his name was here. So what happened did the little devil child get nailed?
[13649.38s -> 13653.16s]  Okay, so now what?
[13655.79s -> 13662.15s]  I mean, this is I have to do this one. This helps us has to we now know for sure that we can alter
[13662.15s -> 13664.15s]  What happens true seriously?
[13664.83s -> 13666.83s]  We can change the friggin past
[13667.19s -> 13670.45s]  Not cool. This sucks. I
[13671.17s -> 13675.17s]  Don't know the dude yelling at us in all caps be cooperative
[13676.05s -> 13678.05s]  Cooperate has got me like, okay
[13678.77s -> 13681.61s]  Looks like a difference, but we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves
[13683.29s -> 13685.29s]  We have flip-flopping
[13686.17s -> 13688.17s]  Much it's unbelievable
[13689.49s -> 13699.85s]  Whatever's out there. It still wants Taylor. We have to go now
[13700.89s -> 13717.34s]  Okay, explore the factory bounce up. I found something. I
[13718.06s -> 13720.56s]  Remember my dad in pants like that
[13720.92s -> 13735.03s]  Emery of James Clark the guy in the town on the left. It's a weird comment
[13743.79s -> 13755.38s]  Just go kill Hitler guys. We can alter the past fuck this like dumb Salem witch trial shit. Let's go kill Hitler
[13757.14s -> 13761.62s]  Unfortunately, we would need some kind of like demon Hitler to grab our arm to take us back to that
[13762.54s -> 13768.14s]  I'm sorry. I can't explain what just happened
[13768.54s -> 13773.10s]  What a video game bug spirit just
[13773.96s -> 13779.60s]  Yanked me about 10 feet backward. I spoke demon Hitler's name and he he pushed me dude
[13779.60s -> 13784.80s]  I'll push from this end. Did you get log? It was a log grab or was it? Oh, it was like a like bug grab
[13784.80s -> 13786.80s]  Oh everything you got
[13795.49s -> 13799.14s]  Nice fall joke that on purpose
[13801.65s -> 13808.51s]  Why'd you do that just about I was looking at Lord
[13809.55s -> 13814.32s]  No, I just pressed a button. I'll look for a way out down here
[13815.77s -> 13818.29s]  Okay, we'll meet up at the back of the building
[13818.89s -> 13823.89s]  Sure, he looks really yeah, but why we have not been able to control Taylor for the last 40 minutes
[13825.29s -> 13827.29s]  There's like a crypt down here
[13828.05s -> 13835.59s]  You guys can't reach a stick down and like both work together to pick me up or something. So you're John right now, right?
[13835.59s -> 13841.57s]  I don't know so find out a second. I'm watching Andrew right now. Yeah
[13841.77s -> 13844.97s]  Maybe this is both of us. Someone's gonna get a co-op partner and someone's not
[13847.06s -> 13853.62s]  Hmm, or maybe we're just these two people. Oh
[13854.14s -> 13856.14s]  Let's see. It looks like it's changing scenes
[13856.54s -> 13866.23s]  Are you here with me as Andrew or Taylor? I just switched back to John I think okay
[13866.23s -> 13868.23s]  Well, let's go ahead and mute those mics
[13868.43s -> 13872.80s]  Thank God. I have the co-op partner because I'm the one that needs all the help
[13877.01s -> 13879.18s]  You're okay
[13879.18s -> 13887.68s]  It's a chance for you to kill two more people
[13888.36s -> 13893.98s]  Okay, how funny would it be if it's Alex?
[13894.50s -> 13897.75s]  Just randomly with the mics muted
[13898.39s -> 13906.22s]  Gets like a game over on his screen because these two are dead and he's the last one. Imagine the disappointment
[13914.21s -> 13916.37s]  Four out of four dead from me
[13916.93s -> 13920.16s]  Now he has to be responsible for somebody dying. You know what I mean?
[13920.68s -> 13922.92s]  He's gonna fuck up a cutie. I'm gonna fall down a hill
[13924.88s -> 13926.40s]  What would you do?
[13926.40s -> 13931.49s]  What was the purpose of that? Yeah, there was no point you just went down and we went I saw the little girl on a bridge
[13931.81s -> 13938.07s]  To see you same here literally it right
[13940.97s -> 13948.79s]  Hunter that dude was just looking at us. Where did you guys come from?
[13949.21s -> 13952.45s]  We just like right now. Yeah, we just walked up over you
[13954.32s -> 13958.26s]  Somebody said oh, no, it's zon. It's Hitler. That's not how this works
[13962.83s -> 13969.46s]  Somebody seen this before old car witchcraft on this car. I hope somebody law grabs me out of the trunk
[13970.46s -> 13972.88s]  Damn it. Oh
[13972.88s -> 13976.28s]  I found the little girl again. You keep a little girl
[13977.12s -> 13980.64s]  Don't shine your flashlight at her. She's waiting for her cue
[13983.08s -> 13987.83s]  Okay, okay careful. Stop. Stop. Stop. Freeze. I
[13988.51s -> 13996.26s]  Look to your left and then walk towards me slowly. No your other left. You said left you turned right
[13996.90s -> 14007.29s]  What are you talking about? Turn left and walk towards John. I did turn left turn left and walk towards John
[14008.21s -> 14014.43s]  My left the characters left. How would I know which way your cameras facing? That's what I did
[14014.61s -> 14022.00s]  You're just standing there walk towards John. Okay now without turning the camera look behind you
[14022.00s -> 14028.88s]  How do I look behind me without turning the camera? Okay, well turn the camera, but don't turn your character
[14028.88s -> 14033.47s]  No, that's what I was doing and you screamed at me. Yeah, cuz you've shown the flashlight right at it
[14033.47s -> 14045.27s]  I don't see you see the little girl. No, she's standing in the like past the picket fence. You don't see her
[14045.31s -> 14051.13s]  No, okay walk towards the fence then and let's see what happens the other okay behind you
[14053.04s -> 14057.32s]  Wait, your camera is behind you face your character the way my character's facing
[14057.32s -> 14063.08s]  But you don't talk or or somebody exposed. Okay. All right. I'm seeing
[14063.68s -> 14070.78s]  Come on. Okay. Yeah, you're looking over here. You're looking straight this way. There's no little girl, right?
[14070.78s -> 14077.45s]  Turn the camera around because if you shine the flashlight at her, she's gonna freak out. She's in the other opposite direction
[14077.85s -> 14086.54s]  She's this way, but I'm trying not to shine my flat. Oh, okay. She's all this is past that fat
[14086.54s -> 14090.94s]  Okay, I'm trying to avoid the trigger that happens when we inadvertently walk up to it
[14090.94s -> 14095.65s]  I thought you talked about like over this fence that we're standing in front of yeah
[14095.77s -> 14103.26s]  I'm just wondering how long is she gonna stand there like waiting for us to do like a spook. Let's sneak up on her
[14103.26s -> 14118.92s]  No, never mind in the fog there. You see that see that's what I cooperate
[14119.32s -> 14127.10s]  All right, so is this girl real is this girl real in real life here in our time
[14127.10s -> 14130.58s]  Is it is one in this timeline and one in like the 300 years ago time?
[14130.58s -> 14133.74s]  But like who the fuck is this? This is the current timeline one
[14136.14s -> 14138.14s]  So there's three
[14138.14s -> 14140.32s]  The lower one is the old time
[14140.72s -> 14143.84s]  No one in the whole safe while you still draw breath
[14144.68s -> 14146.68s]  You must die today
[14146.84s -> 14152.50s]  Not even your wife Amy was torture. Why do you rocks? Why doesn't everyone in town just dog pile on top of them?
[14153.04s -> 14155.60s]  It's speaking of my late wife
[14155.96s -> 14160.68s]  There is still fighting you drop the rock on his head drive the devil out for the safety of everyone here
[14165.36s -> 14168.64s]  Joseph do you renounce the devil and all his teachings?
[14173.04s -> 14175.44s]  I'm no disciple of the devil
[14180.40s -> 14182.40s]  I who
[14186.48s -> 14192.16s]  Have to stop this. Oh, what the fuck?
[14200.48s -> 14202.48s]  Just listen to me listen to me give me that's all
[14203.28s -> 14206.10s]  You give me that look
[14206.10s -> 14210.98s]  See how this poor child is tormented Joseph still clutches her with the devil's hand
[14211.74s -> 14214.06s]  more stones
[14214.06s -> 14216.38s]  The devil must be crushed from within him
[14217.66s -> 14222.08s]  Do not flinch
[14222.84s -> 14228.08s]  Wait the reverend is in on it. He's the actual which guy
[14229.24s -> 14235.44s]  Look, okay
[14235.44s -> 14240.28s]  If I had walked over there and lifted I could have lifted the rocks up they would float and it'd be like oh
[14240.28s -> 14242.28s]  And it's the Satan and she's doing that
[14242.80s -> 14246.84s]  The rocks will be floating around
[14247.12s -> 14250.44s]  And it would be even worse
[14250.44s -> 14256.22s]  I'm just trying to get the fucking doll out of her hand. It's new monster time
[14256.86s -> 14274.82s]  All right, have we considered like tying a rope around our waists so we don't get lost separated or you're you don't have a lot of time
[14274.98s -> 14279.42s]  Have we considered spelling out shit in the dirt with the rock that just says like
[14280.64s -> 14282.64s]  We're not Satan
[14289.40s -> 14291.40s]  Would you get sledgehammer
[14298.41s -> 14305.43s]  They almost got me with that one they move the circle
[14306.07s -> 14309.40s]  Why am I standing here?
[14322.19s -> 14324.19s]  That's okay, I'm handling this one
[14325.27s -> 14331.41s]  All right, I'm coming my character decided to do something
[14334.71s -> 14340.63s]  My God, I swear to God, but by this point this is pretty much
[14353.30s -> 14361.82s]  QTE's what year are we come on? This is like 2001
[14368.20s -> 14371.78s]  Don't worry fuck the QTE's I can tap faster than anybody
[14372.26s -> 14376.88s]  You just leave foot is in the air waiting to kick him in the face
[14377.66s -> 14379.86s]  We just have to load your foot
[14386.98s -> 14388.98s]  I can't get this wrong
[14395.54s -> 14400.30s]  How fast I was trying to move the mouse you have no idea
[14401.50s -> 14404.96s]  So you serious?
[14405.12s -> 14410.18s]  Please tell me you heard me
[14410.58s -> 14413.26s]  One two, three, four five with the fucking mouse
[14414.26s -> 14419.11s]  That was that was I can't fucking believe that
[14420.27s -> 14422.27s]  fucking believe it
[14422.39s -> 14428.22s]  You heard it. You all had to have heard it. I can't be held exactly what I saw
[14428.50s -> 14433.78s]  All right, listen, can we pause the game for just a second this is good don't pop
[14439.56s -> 14441.56s]  Did you go over three there
[14444.24s -> 14453.36s]  I tried so hard. All right. We're all dead. None of us is getting out of here alive. Hey, we're not dead yet
[14457.04s -> 14462.03s]  Listen something here isn't right. I had one last chance to undo
[14462.75s -> 14464.51s]  That fuck up
[14464.51s -> 14471.83s]  but they switched the QTE type on me at the last second and I I missed the last one because I had four in a row of
[14472.35s -> 14478.43s]  Move the thumb stick and hit the crosshair and then on the last one they switched it to push X
[14479.03s -> 14482.63s]  so if you try to move the thumb stick that counts as a button and
[14483.31s -> 14484.99s]  it invalidates
[14484.99s -> 14487.23s]  dude, I was like and
[14487.89s -> 14494.97s]  And what happened at the end for there man, I had to do not one not two not three but four full
[14495.25s -> 14500.25s]  Wrist across my entire mouse pad and I didn't even get halfway. You know what I did
[14500.25s -> 14502.25s]  I just moved my thumb to the left and right
[14502.53s -> 14504.37s]  controller, baby
[14504.37s -> 14506.37s]  I'm plug a controller in right now
[14507.09s -> 14517.70s]  All right, pause it pause it pause. I need a second. That was so stupid that it was
[14520.75s -> 14525.99s]  Unfucking believable. Let me just plug a goddamn controller, but here's like I don't move the mouse
[14525.99s -> 14529.15s]  You can't even do it because we it asks you if you want to use a controller or a keyboard
[14529.15s -> 14533.17s]  We'd have to like go back to menu at this point. What's the at this point? What's the point?
[14533.91s -> 14537.31s]  Shit. Yeah, it's what's the point we got like fucking maybe
[14537.95s -> 14542.40s]  Listen everybody German just didn't want to do a fuckface run after this
[14542.40s -> 14547.00s]  So he's just trying to make the first one the fuckface runs that way with that both of them at the same time. Oh
[14549.50s -> 14556.91s]  My chest is killing me that was too fucking funny it was so stupid. All right, I
[14557.61s -> 14565.56s]  Try to use a controller. What do you think Alex? You'd be you'd be the judge at this point
[14565.56s -> 14570.03s]  I mean, you know what to expect with the mouse and keyboard. Okay, that's true
[14570.03s -> 14574.42s]  I don't know if you switch to a controller. You've got it like I gotta relearn just again
[14574.42s -> 14579.80s]  That's true. By the way, somebody said it was six times. It was six full across the whole mousepad
[14580.08s -> 14585.57s]  Wait, you you missed six in a row. No, no, okay. I had I had to bring my mouse
[14586.11s -> 14590.73s]  Across the screen into the target to click and hit with the sledgehammer
[14590.99s -> 14594.97s]  But it that for some reason the mouse sensitivity was so
[14595.67s -> 14600.35s]  Obscenely slow and I have no idea why I had to do one two three four five six
[14600.87s -> 14614.40s]  Across the whole mousepad to get it halfway. I have no idea. It was fucking outrageous. Let me look hold on controls
[14614.72s -> 14623.03s]  Yeah, it's my mouse sensitivity is fucking 50. It's huge. That's just the default. Well, I don't need to change that
[14623.03s -> 14626.98s]  All right, I'm just gonna go whatever I've already know I let's go
[14627.56s -> 14635.22s]  All right me first. Oh my god, I'm like, I'm gonna have to get back after this shit
[14636.14s -> 14648.80s]  Okay, let's go. No, I didn't if I hit the DPI button, I mean this would be different. This has not changed at all
[14649.28s -> 14658.84s]  Why do I have to be three for three for killing everybody? It's not fair
[14659.22s -> 14667.68s]  How would I know that there's even anything on this wall? They don't notice me at all
[14667.68s -> 14672.16s]  They don't care. See I told you guys that was the key line. You were right beginning of the game that
[14673.00s -> 14675.48s]  Actually, that's exactly what you said. I'm gonna have to give you credit
[14676.62s -> 14680.78s]  Wait, did you hear what I just heard? Yeah, I'm currently stuck staring out of a window
[14681.22s -> 14687.68s]  But did you hear like the little girl's voice? Yes, I did. I'm I can't get out of the window
[14688.00s -> 14696.06s]  Are you are we in the same room? I'm looking at like a grandfather
[14697.70s -> 14703.32s]  With a key in it and you come like bump me can you come like grab me by the back or something?
[14703.32s -> 14717.62s]  I can't move on. It's a key in here. Take the key. Take the key. Okay, I got out. I can't take the key
[14718.20s -> 14720.87s]  No, I fucking do I need to come bump you?
[14730.29s -> 14733.23s]  You missed your cue you supposed to scare me
[14734.05s -> 14754.63s]  Me no. No, I can't even explain. It was just fucking stupid. All right, it didn't work
[14754.87s -> 14758.09s]  I'm gonna come to you because I think my game is starting to fucking
[14759.21s -> 14775.95s]  attack itself
[14775.95s -> 14777.95s]  Successful parenting. I think this is like a
[14778.27s -> 14784.03s]  Reverend reverend's cursing little girls with witchcraft through time the game based on that lore. I
[14784.75s -> 14792.68s]  Can't get over it. I it's too stupid. Hi
[14793.38s -> 14797.41s]  People are spamming right now. They say on my first playthrough
[14798.01s -> 14804.57s]  All of my characters survived even though I was I wasn't trying very hard to keep them alive. That's from IGN
[14805.25s -> 14809.77s]  Whatever wait IGN said that yeah, I can't give the game five by the way
[14810.15s -> 14813.66s]  They were probably playing with a controller probably they were I'm sure they were
[14814.42s -> 14824.28s]  games and and
[14824.64s -> 14830.20s]  Wait, where the hell? Where are we?
[14830.64s -> 14834.42s]  How many can see more that I can't touch?
[14834.58s -> 14840.54s]  Yeah, me too, but I can go upstairs and in my yoink. Let's go. Maybe yeah, maybe you'll yoink us. Yeah
[14841.02s -> 14847.67s]  You hear that? Yep. Gotta be that kid upstairs
[14848.61s -> 14852.03s]  We have to go find her. Well, this is the house that burned down
[14852.07s -> 14853.23s]  so
[14853.23s -> 14863.24s]  Why did we burn down here and then get in a car accident and then teleport back to the year like 1600 you?
[14863.40s -> 14866.24s]  She's in here eating candy
[14867.76s -> 14869.36s]  I'm chewing ice
[14869.36s -> 14884.56s]  Well, that I've just broke a tooth all my teeth in the back of gone. I think we're about to get Lord grabbed
[14888.88s -> 14890.88s]  Nice it's so
[14897.12s -> 14899.12s]  This isn't right no way I
[14903.39s -> 14909.35s]  Assure all gathered here today that our town will be free of the devil's grasp this place burns down together by God's grace
[14909.59s -> 14911.59s]  Little hope will prevail
[14911.63s -> 14916.55s]  My word on it. This court is hastily convened, but with good reason
[14917.07s -> 14923.07s]  If we are to finally rid ourselves of the evil which has infested little old then we must act today. I
[14924.55s -> 14927.47s]  Accused you Mary of witchcraft
[14928.43s -> 14930.43s]  What say you reverend?
[14930.43s -> 14931.99s]  We're gonna save her
[14931.99s -> 14938.53s]  The evidence has discovered through my investigation is beyond question who hit me in this shit drop the chandelier on right now
[14938.53s -> 14940.65s]  It's a familiar to summon and serve the devil
[14941.57s -> 14945.72s]  We have been deceived by a child by her guise of innocence
[14946.36s -> 14950.56s]  This pop it was mistakenly used to denounce Tabitha
[14950.92s -> 14954.20s]  But it has always belonged to Mary and Mary alone
[14955.12s -> 14959.68s]  She allowed her own kin to be executed as she watched in silence
[14961.76s -> 14968.10s]  Now this child this creature of Satan has the marrow to accuse me a man of God of wrongdoing
[14968.92s -> 14972.24s]  No, it's good
[14972.28s -> 14976.92s]  Neither of my options are good. This is crazy. These people have lost their freaking minds
[14982.66s -> 14984.66s]  What can I do no
[14984.74s -> 14989.30s]  If I could do something to stop this I would right now in her hour of greatest need
[14989.30s -> 14992.94s]  I don't see out of the damn pleads once more for the devil's help. Oh
[14994.60s -> 14998.10s]  Wait, I think the courts indulgence we convinced him to step in
[14998.88s -> 15003.62s]  Please guide me at this time this now. They're both gonna die. Oh shit
[15004.36s -> 15010.72s]  Carver is evil Carver's the priest right this carver the priest is Alex. I think so got him. We have to stop this
[15011.36s -> 15017.80s]  The only madness is right here in this court Carver. He's the evil one. We have been swayed by malice
[15018.28s -> 15022.24s]  The truth hidden from us, but not by Mary
[15023.45s -> 15027.85s]  Reverend Carver is the one urging us to believe in the devil silent
[15027.85s -> 15032.65s]  This is all you'll not deceive us any longer. Your true purpose is plain to see I
[15033.25s -> 15036.13s]  Will see this town purged of all evil
[15037.25s -> 15045.28s]  Better go for him. He's right. Listen to him Carver is the guilty one. What must I do to bring little home back into the line?
[15045.88s -> 15047.52s]  I
[15047.52s -> 15050.40s]  Guess burn down the whole church destroy the doll or
[15051.40s -> 15055.26s]  Yeah, you have to stop Carver. Just hit stop Carver
[15056.00s -> 15057.92s]  Don't Carver
[15057.92s -> 15061.74s]  Stop car. You have to stop Carver. It's him. Don't you get it?
[15062.30s -> 15064.34s]  He's condemning Mary to take the heat off himself
[15064.94s -> 15066.94s]  Do nothing
[15068.86s -> 15089.24s]  Where to God if he shoots himself in the head that doesn't count this outrage this is a centrist run
[15090.60s -> 15096.84s]  What I have just learned sickens me to my core. What did you just learn? Yeah, there are serious questions
[15096.84s -> 15098.84s]  Which must be asked of you?
[15099.00s -> 15101.79s]  What would he say?
[15101.79s -> 15103.63s]  Look in the first page of his bible
[15103.63s -> 15109.71s]  How can a man of god conduct himself in such a way does it just do know that those are doodles of my math homework
[15110.59s -> 15113.15s]  Fucking bullshit. You are free to leave
[15114.35s -> 15115.84s]  fool
[15115.84s -> 15117.76s]  misled by a child
[15117.76s -> 15119.93s]  Do you not see what she is?
[15120.49s -> 15124.09s]  I was just bored during the last sermon. So I do my favorite dragon ball z characters
[15124.33s -> 15129.53s]  The devil's daughter has deceived you. I feel that I used to draw a diablo two items. I see her
[15130.25s -> 15132.09s]  I see her
[15132.09s -> 15134.01s]  Satan's whore
[15134.01s -> 15136.01s]  You will pay heavily for your crimes
[15136.97s -> 15142.17s]  I was one of the first doodles in his bible. Jesus now all that little hope is mesmerized by you
[15143.29s -> 15145.95s]  if not the words
[15145.95s -> 15147.95s]  Without you I would be dead
[15148.19s -> 15152.83s]  You said how did we know that his I shall remember you all my days. We didn't know that we had no idea
[15153.23s -> 15155.23s]  That's info that past
[15155.23s -> 15157.07s]  Andrew had I guess
[15157.07s -> 15160.03s]  But why why wouldn't he immediately act on that if he knew that?
[15161.15s -> 15175.04s]  Wait, what still killed three people? They were dead fucking wait
[15175.84s -> 15181.76s]  It worked. Yeah. No, I looked in the bible, but it did old timey. Andrew didn't look in the bible
[15182.56s -> 15184.96s]  Yeah, that jerk of a priest was the real bad guy
[15186.64s -> 15189.28s]  Sure. Yeah
[15189.28s -> 15191.28s]  I mean I should feel great. Uh
[15192.92s -> 15195.16s]  But I don't I I feel nothing
[15195.88s -> 15200.09s]  Come on. Let's get out of here
[15200.09s -> 15203.77s]  How do we get out of here? Don't we just walk around the circle or is that this is the curse lifted?
[15208.30s -> 15211.34s]  Did he just storm out? I don't think he's dead yet, right the priest
[15213.12s -> 15216.56s]  Yeah, but I all right. So but the okay the house in the beginning is supposed to be
[15218.27s -> 15220.99s]  He whispered the script into his ear
[15222.27s -> 15238.91s]  Wait, and what's going on? Are you trapped in there?
[15240.54s -> 15242.54s]  um
[15242.62s -> 15244.62s]  Giving you any flashbacks?
[15244.62s -> 15246.62s]  Am I gonna catch fire in a second?
[15247.10s -> 15249.10s]  No, you you got didn't you hang?
[15251.04s -> 15253.34s]  Uh, someone's behind me
[15254.51s -> 15257.71s]  Oh here I go getting grabbed by the smoker again
[15262.54s -> 15263.82s]  Wait
[15263.82s -> 15268.09s]  You just died
[15268.09s -> 15273.21s]  Why do you just die? Because I wasn't nice enough in real in my life
[15274.25s -> 15276.25s]  I was indecisive and
[15276.97s -> 15278.97s]  Abrasive or whatever
[15278.97s -> 15287.44s]  We're being judged
[15287.44s -> 15291.20s]  But what about Andrew? I don't think I did we do anything bad as taylor?
[15292.24s -> 15296.00s]  You were taylor, right? I mean I called somebody a dick like in the beginning of the game
[15296.80s -> 15303.37s]  Yeah, but this didn't stick this exact same thing happened in the beginning of the game with the fire
[15303.77s -> 15306.73s]  Then I ran away and then I woke from a car accident. Remember?
[15307.53s -> 15312.14s]  Shouldn't have called that guy a dick
[15313.24s -> 15318.60s]  Everybody who is mean to anybody else at any point in this game gets killed by their monster double
[15318.84s -> 15320.84s]  What's the but what's the whole car accident part?
[15324.76s -> 15337.10s]  But what what's the whole burn the house down in the beginning part? Well, we uh
[15338.52s -> 15343.88s]  Every single person in the game is dead now except uh, no john no john's dead
[15344.04s -> 15346.52s]  Yeah, it comes I have to do it. I have to this infinity war spoiler
[15346.52s -> 15349.32s]  If you haven't seen infinity war then fucking just mute your everything
[15351.18s -> 15362.68s]  This is like just Thanos at the end. I thought you'd be here
[15364.40s -> 15367.04s]  Leave me alone. Will you?
[15367.04s -> 15369.44s]  That's I've lost everything you've lost everything
[15371.10s -> 15376.22s]  Are you kidding me? Who is this? Just get out of here. Go away. You should have stayed away
[15376.94s -> 15381.02s]  Big reveal. Oh
[15382.78s -> 15395.31s]  Is andrew going to jail that was uh tanya's boyfriend
[15396.99s -> 15405.24s]  Why is he so much older and why am I so young anyone those things whatever the hell they are they did it not me
[15408.72s -> 15414.16s]  Um, was there a voice line there? All I wanted to do was keep them safe. He just mouthed the words. Yeah
[15415.36s -> 15417.04s]  You okay, buddy
[15417.04s -> 15419.04s]  You seem a little confused
[15424.24s -> 15425.88s]  Don't do it
[15425.88s -> 15433.18s]  Don't do it
[15433.18s -> 15436.38s]  You don't need to push his head down. He doesn't even have cuffs on he can
[15437.02s -> 15438.22s]  Just get in
[15438.22s -> 15439.34s]  Wait
[15439.34s -> 15440.94s]  He just aged
[15440.94s -> 15456.76s]  He's not gonna do it all traffic through little you're the driver
[15457.32s -> 15466.09s]  You seem a little confused. Yeah, i'm fine. I just want to get these folks to where they need to be
[15466.73s -> 15472.41s]  I doubt a short delay will trouble him too much
[15473.37s -> 15476.81s]  Yeah, why wouldn't that officer be like, um, what the fuck you're talking about
[15477.69s -> 15489.79s]  Yeah, I didn't uh, I didn't see this part coming. This is supposed to be like a split personality thing
[15489.79s -> 15493.15s]  Where he just like is all the characters. Can everyone just shut up?
[15493.79s -> 15504.52s]  This isn't helping us find help. Well, but this is accurate though because everybody died
[15504.68s -> 15516.09s]  So it's he was the only one left. So this is accurate. Oh, so we like talk to him in the bar
[15516.17s -> 15530.09s]  But we were just me a bus driver. Have you seen him? That's funny. Sounds like you could use a drink
[15531.50s -> 15534.57s]  Better not thanks
[15534.57s -> 15536.73s]  I did decline the drink, but what does that have to do with it?
[15544.83s -> 15547.15s]  Weren't there specific times when we were in two different places?
[15548.41s -> 15566.09s]  So how does that make any sense? Hey, so all right explosive bullets you motherfucker. You take a goddamn shot
[15570.67s -> 15573.33s]  You're in real danger. So I just was like a delusional
[15574.99s -> 15578.96s]  I don't get it. Don't leave right now
[15580.76s -> 15588.03s]  What's with all the 1600 shit my question is why does this dude live in this abandoned town?
[15588.91s -> 15602.46s]  Yeah
[15602.46s -> 15615.55s]  In a police response times took like 48 hours. Yeah, they're coming. They're coming
[15615.95s -> 15620.19s]  They're coming. Didn't he say didn't he didn't that guy vince say that they're coming to get you they're coming
[15621.24s -> 15626.84s]  Who's coming? Why wouldn't you say like the night before but if you knew that this person had, you know problems
[15626.92s -> 15631.32s]  Why would you do that? Why wouldn't you be like hey, uh, andrew like come talk to me for a minute
[15632.12s -> 15634.76s]  They're coming to get you get a different result
[15635.77s -> 15638.65s]  I think that was the ending for you actually killed
[15638.73s -> 15644.25s]  I want to believe with demons if you don't lay them there was an ending where everyone survives and it's fine
[15644.33s -> 15646.73s]  But I don't know not a very happy ending
[15647.68s -> 15651.60s]  Or maybe it is but maybe that's just one of the is okay. What makes you happy?
[15651.92s -> 15655.74s]  It's possible. That's not what really happened and you eventually
[15656.89s -> 15659.90s]  Found him the bus driver
[15660.14s -> 15665.34s]  Maybe he can now put the past behind him. Never mind. He's telling us that was real ending
[15671.34s -> 15684.38s]  Imagine if when we got a hint in the very beginning of the game. He went it's the bus driver. It's you till we meet again
[15685.47s -> 15692.03s]  Maybe in the south pacific or the arabian desert dude. This is the next two or somewhere else
[15696.30s -> 15703.87s]  But we will meet again at least one more time at least one more time. Did you hear that?
[15704.59s -> 15705.39s]  Yeah
[15705.39s -> 15707.39s]  What did we say at the beginning of the stream?
[15707.55s -> 15709.82s]  What did we say?
[15709.90s -> 15714.94s]  Um eight of these supposed to be eight of these yeah said i'll see at least one more time
[15715.58s -> 15720.38s]  He didn't say i'll see you
[15720.62s -> 15722.92s]  Six more times
[15722.92s -> 15726.44s]  I think they've got at least guaranteed budget for one more
[15728.67s -> 15730.75s]  I'll see i'll see you again guy
[15731.95s -> 15733.95s]  In october of 2021
[15736.57s -> 15738.57s]  for man of madan
[15739.47s -> 15741.47s]  The re madanading
[15742.43s -> 15750.16s]  I'm reading man of madan3 madan is back. Is this a copyright song or is this a game?
[15757.10s -> 15759.10s]  All right, here's the thing
[15760.38s -> 15764.30s]  They have a really cool idea here like it really is like you can play a co-op
[15764.78s -> 15767.90s]  The kind of choices game with another person. It's like a horror game. That's cool
[15769.87s -> 15771.87s]  I kind of feel like they get so
[15772.03s -> 15776.75s]  Far into the weeds with how the story has to be this super twisty bullshit
[15777.71s -> 15781.71s]  Like you just make a horror make it a horror game make it like scary and just horror movie
[15781.87s -> 15786.51s]  Why does it have to have this weird going into the past and into the future and then what's a twist?
[15786.59s -> 15790.51s]  This is another twist watch out. You're not you you're this guy. You might not be me
[15792.43s -> 15798.27s]  I guess they don't want uh jackass is like us to guess the ending two and a half hours in but it's like
[15799.23s -> 15802.19s]  Doesn't really matter that much if you do as long as it's a nice story
[15802.51s -> 15804.67s]  Yeah, but that's what I mean wouldn't it be more fun if?
[15805.31s -> 15811.33s]  If the the actual story was about you get to choose kind of who lives and dies and not about like here's this convoluted
[15812.19s -> 15813.71s]  twisty story
[15813.71s -> 15815.07s]  Like that itself is fun
[15815.07s -> 15819.23s]  Like having like five to ten people that you get to decide when and maybe try to save them
[15819.31s -> 15821.63s]  Do they die? Do they not die? Is the monster there?
[15823.20s -> 15825.20s]  I I guess are we led to believe
[15827.00s -> 15829.56s]  They they explained away with the hand wave
[15830.52s -> 15837.82s]  All the other characters in our timeline, but was there any closure for like the old timeline or was that also a delusion?
[15839.88s -> 15842.28s]  Uh, i'm, sorry. There's somebody like just singing loudly over you
[15843.24s -> 15845.24s]  Yeah, it's in credits
[15846.62s -> 15849.26s]  We I we can't skip can I alt tab?
[15850.68s -> 15852.04s]  Oh
[15852.04s -> 15854.76s]  Unless it's an after credits thing. There was an after credits in man of a damn
[15855.56s -> 15859.64s]  Nobody said there is an ending where you know. Well, i'm so glad we didn't get it
[15860.81s -> 15864.81s]  There is uh, there wasn't after credits in madan I think yeah
[15871.16s -> 15873.16s]  There is an ending where you do that
[15874.06s -> 15876.06s]  Can you imagine if that's how that ended?
[15876.14s -> 15878.62s]  That would be so ridiculous. I would I would have to do it
[15879.82s -> 15884.62s]  What was with the beginning scene? It was just really unlucky house fire where everybody died
[15886.65s -> 15888.65s]  Yeah, I that's what but that's what i'm saying. Like what?
[15889.29s -> 15891.29s]  You you don't have to make this
[15891.85s -> 15898.57s]  Crazy multi-layered story horror movies are scary because there's a monster that fucking kills people and it's like a popcorn movie
[15899.53s -> 15901.53s]  i've got a skip button, but
[15901.61s -> 15904.22s]  I don't know
[15904.22s -> 15908.22s]  We don't need layers on top of layers on top of layers of storytelling like just this 10 people
[15908.46s -> 15912.86s]  They all like have their own personalities and you get to do something go on go on an adventure and be careful
[15912.94s -> 15914.94s]  Some of them might fucking die get the monster at the end
[15915.58s -> 15920.38s]  well, the problem is there's like too many characters that you kind of don't care when they die because like
[15920.94s -> 15925.74s]  Let me just throw a character out there daniel. What was his personality? I don't know. It was just
[15926.30s -> 15929.50s]  I i'm I just guy that stands around and reacts
[15930.14s -> 15933.34s]  Would you say he's a react?
[15934.31s -> 15935.53s]  something
[15935.53s -> 15938.49s]  Maybe I don't we don't say that on this channel anymore though
[15943.44s -> 15948.72s]  His personality was daniel. It wasn't just a monster. It was an allegory
[15949.36s -> 15952.11s]  Yeah, I know but
[15952.11s -> 15955.87s]  I I could do without okay. So how long is this? This is about what four and a half hours?
[15956.76s -> 15962.28s]  It was absolutely like maybe an hour and 20 minutes of just kind of exposition
[15963.00s -> 15966.65s]  Well, we could have been like running away from shit and like getting killing each other and stuff
[15967.29s -> 15971.79s]  it's kind of a damned if you do damned if you don't because uh
[15972.43s -> 15974.67s]  The less talking there is the more qte's there are
[15975.82s -> 15978.72s]  That's true
[15978.72s -> 15981.26s]  Skip germa is waiting
[15981.26s -> 15989.47s]  Oh, sorry. I thought I pressed it. I thought I had control for some reason these are
[15991.71s -> 15997.26s]  We'll start believing we are under attack by
[15998.06s -> 16001.52s]  You wouldn't believe me even if I tried hell
[16002.08s -> 16004.08s]  I don't believe it and I was there
[16004.48s -> 16006.48s]  I hope we actually get to use guns in the next one. That was fun
[16007.60s -> 16012.70s]  They say the souls of the dead were deep underground. I thought that thing was like three days ago
[16013.93s -> 16015.93s]  That's bazuzu
[16016.09s -> 16022.16s]  Isn't it?
[16023.92s -> 16026.96s]  I actually fought that thing like in vr like four days ago
[16028.75s -> 16030.94s]  house of ashes
[16030.94s -> 16039.28s]  It's actually bazuzu. Oh, there you go. Achievement unlocked fate worse than death
[16040.09s -> 16042.33s]  You played the second man of the damn game
[16046.43s -> 16050.24s]  little hope
[16050.24s -> 16051.36s]  well
[16051.36s -> 16054.88s]  There was no after credits. It was just a trailer. What are the bonus features?
[16061.20s -> 16064.00s]  Designing the demons an interview with will polter
[16064.88s -> 16073.45s]  The art book fuckface run. I mean, I feel like it's gonna take a long time to do a fuckface run of this game
[16074.64s -> 16077.92s]  Uh, I feel like it's a lot of boring bits that we can't skip
[16080.65s -> 16089.74s]  Not if we don't read any of the lore and just remember because we walked forward last time I kind of
[16090.38s -> 16096.17s]  I'll do whatever you want to just see what happens. It's up to you. We already did a fuckface run
[16096.25s -> 16099.05s]  That was yeah, but we didn't do a no talking run
[16100.16s -> 16101.36s]  Yeah
[16101.36s -> 16105.52s]  I feel like there's like probably an hour worth of doing nothing before like somebody dies
[16109.50s -> 16113.10s]  Because they really back loaded a lot of that content like in the last hour or two
[16113.58s -> 16121.77s]  Well, let's try it let's let's let's try to do nothing run and just try to kill everybody as fast as possible
[16126.64s -> 16129.92s]  The real fuckface run is a lot everyone alive run
[16131.44s -> 16133.68s]  All right. Yeah, let's just say let's just try it might as well
[16135.52s -> 16140.80s]  This is the bonus portion of the stream if you're going to leave. I mean if it's really bad
[16141.36s -> 16148.89s]  Yeah, there's nothing wrong with just like stopping after it's not like it has to be finished if uh, it doesn't work out
[16150.81s -> 16154.81s]  Uh, I give me one sec. I do want to say one quick thing to my stream
[16155.05s -> 16159.44s]  I'll give you a second to talk to your stream too alone alone
[16161.98s -> 16166.78s]  All right. So if you're taking off that was uh, man of a dan 2 dark
[16167.32s -> 16174.46s]  Anthology 2 whatever it is little hope tomorrow is halloween actually 8 9 10
[16174.62s -> 16177.26s]  It actually is halloween. I think for a lot of you guys if you're in eu
[16177.74s -> 16186.06s]  Tomorrow we're doing vr. So we're going to be playing exclusively scary vr games tomorrow for halloween
[16188.16s -> 16190.00s]  For the remainder of tonight, we're just gonna do this
[16190.00s -> 16193.72s]  We're just gonna fuck around and if this is just boring then this stream just ends
[16198.22s -> 16203.50s]  So if you take it off, we'll see you tomorrow. Maybe for vr and halloween if I don't see you tomorrow then happy halloween
[16206.28s -> 16209.16s]  And pleasure and here comes the bonus content
[16210.94s -> 16213.56s]  rate the game
[16213.80s -> 16222.99s]  I don't like it. I don't think it's like a four. Uh
[16225.24s -> 16228.68s]  It's it's definitely a at least it's at least a five it is
[16229.88s -> 16233.92s]  It's not lower than a five. It's just just not great
[16234.40s -> 16237.18s]  Let's get some input here
[16237.18s -> 16241.26s]  Hey, what would you get? Do you think that ig n gave a correct score with a five out of ten for this?
[16243.58s -> 16245.48s]  um
[16245.48s -> 16249.88s]  Or do you think this is more like a 5.8 or like a six? I i'm gonna probably say like
[16250.36s -> 16259.02s]  What was man of a dan? I think okay easier question, which is better this or man of a dan man of a dan was probably better because
[16259.34s -> 16262.56s]  It just I feel like it was more fun to play man of a dan
[16265.69s -> 16271.68s]  Yeah, I think uh moment to moment. I think man of a dan somehow made even less sense than this
[16272.24s -> 16278.75s]  But then let you like I don't I don't know you were on a boat like the the yacht then you go
[16279.31s -> 16285.39s]  Diving then you like you weren't just on fog road. Yeah, three quarters of the game. Yeah, it was like different places
[16285.79s -> 16288.11s]  It was at that weird like mansion with the big dinner
[16288.99s -> 16291.47s]  rundown house number five is
[16292.19s -> 16295.26s]  Kind of too much. Yeah
[16297.61s -> 16301.53s]  And you don't do anything during the lore grab segments except
[16302.33s -> 16307.47s]  Like occasionally talk to somebody as a spirit, which I guess didn't exist
[16307.79s -> 16321.18s]  It's 5.7 5.7. I would say I mean I would say five out of ten was pretty fair
[16323.07s -> 16326.83s]  Yeah, 5.7. I think man of a dan was probably like a six and a half
[16326.99s -> 16333.53s]  But I would say man of a dan was like a 6.8 like a seven man of a dan had more like young people dialogue
[16333.85s -> 16335.85s]  But it was um
[16336.49s -> 16338.15s]  just a little bit more
[16340.04s -> 16342.04s]  Yeah, 5.7 for
[16342.95s -> 16350.58s]  Little hope 6.2 for man of a dan final answer, but it was it's still like it's fun to play
[16351.38s -> 16356.26s]  Anyway, I guess it's like it's not a five out of ten. I regret buying it five out of ten
[16356.26s -> 16361.43s]  It's like a five out of ten if I had to be like an objective game reviewer. That's true
[16362.86s -> 16365.74s]  All right. You ready? You ready to try just to do like a don't talk run
[16366.54s -> 16373.35s]  Yeah, and just sit here and watch the movie. I guess we we can do scene selection
[16373.35s -> 16376.23s]  We can skip all the bullshit. I think you know, should we just not skip the bullshit?
[16376.23s -> 16378.86s]  Should we just do from the beginning? What do you think?
[16382.14s -> 16385.34s]  You can start start from like the house, right? Yeah
[16386.52s -> 16390.73s]  Diversion family. It's just a bus crash in the very beginning, right? Yeah, I think
[16391.45s -> 16393.45s]  This whole first three scenes here
[16395.35s -> 16404.20s]  The reunion I think is where we start from or darkest dreaming because this is this is all predetermined
[16404.60s -> 16414.87s]  All right, we're gonna skip to reunion. Is that the house?
[16415.43s -> 16418.47s]  No, that's like the we got the bus crashed and now we're all standing here
[16419.37s -> 16425.02s]  Oh, yeah, because all that is I think pre like recording. I think they should have just I think what um
[16425.42s -> 16428.38s]  Would have made my opinion better if they didn't lean so hard into like
[16428.94s -> 16436.74s]  The twist like you were saying like the guy is crazy and he just imagined all those people and shot at you
[16437.85s -> 16440.10s]  like why not hone in on the
[16440.96s -> 16444.74s]  Spiritual aspect instead of I I feel like that was the same thing a man of a damn
[16444.98s -> 16449.70s]  They're scared to tell like a supernatural horror story and they want to be based in reality
[16449.78s -> 16456.10s]  It has to have some kind of explanation people saying use a controller for me to press no buttons
[16456.50s -> 16467.30s]  Um, I don't think are you sure you want me to what are you talking about? All right, you're ready. Let's uh, here we go
[16467.86s -> 16469.38s]  it's time to uh
[16469.38s -> 16474.07s]  Do nothing because I I liked the
[16475.59s -> 16481.18s]  The lore better up until the end because man of a dan was like they're breathing in the gas
[16481.34s -> 16485.98s]  And if you accidentally talk to your co-op partner once you'll figure out the entire plot
[16486.46s -> 16492.25s]  Yeah, you do if all it takes is the other person you're playing with to go
[16492.41s -> 16497.58s]  Hey, I just like attacked you. It's like oh, that's the whole story ruined. Hey taylor
[16498.14s -> 16504.66s]  Help me get andrew up on his feet. Will you I don't remember anything. Who are you?
[16505.22s -> 16509.78s]  Okay, so andrew is talking to nobody right? Okay. I'm john. You're a college professor
[16510.26s -> 16514.66s]  You're taking a bus on a field trip, but that didn't work out so well. I got a question crash wasn't on
[16514.74s -> 16519.70s]  So why is he imagining these people? What's significant? Is this his family? This is his family, right?
[16520.42s -> 16522.74s]  As a character building exercise
[16527.27s -> 16529.59s]  Come on, we can do it. What if we just don't
[16538.68s -> 16544.68s]  So since you're like player one, yeah, I don't think my character's conversation is even happening
[16545.08s -> 16549.38s]  Oh, that's right flames all around us. It was like I have a split
[16551.91s -> 16554.55s]  That trail the others are on will come out down the road
[16554.63s -> 16556.63s]  So this is his dad
[16556.63s -> 16562.87s]  But wouldn't he know wouldn't he recognize them like as his dad and his like family and shit wouldn't he recognize them
[16563.19s -> 16572.23s]  Why can't we stay here? No, we could be here all night
[16572.71s -> 16577.27s]  Our best move is to get to the others amnesia towards town. See if we can find some help
[16577.75s -> 16585.05s]  The bus driver might come back. We should wait for him. The driver's done
[16585.05s -> 16593.46s]  What we should be doing gone into town for help. This is just this person's just listening to music
[16597.34s -> 16600.78s]  Okay, wait here all night then i'll go myself
[16602.07s -> 16608.07s]  Hey, i've already missed my first qt. Yeah, I missed two in a row professor, right? I got we got pushed into it
[16608.07s -> 16615.42s]  Anyways, no matter can we stick together? I don't want to wait on my own. Yes. He's right. We should all stick together
[16616.44s -> 16620.92s]  I got no signal either must be some kind of black spot or you didn't pay your last bill
[16621.16s -> 16625.00s]  You get that during the crash. Well, this is just the same as I I missed this one the first time
[16626.57s -> 16636.55s]  It's just the same gameplay. Yeah, it is except with added silence. Yeah, it's it's the same thing except with no
[16637.51s -> 16639.51s]  Uh, no extra commentary
[16640.23s -> 16644.30s]  He thinks he's smarter than us, but book smart is no good out here
[16644.62s -> 16647.58s]  He's all up himself acting like the big man on campus
[16652.68s -> 16663.32s]  No choice run that's from that's from being the hanging marks. Yeah, I mean I don't make it
[16663.64s -> 16667.88s]  Okay, when you get all the pieces put in front of you it makes sense, but that doesn't mean it's any good
[16668.12s -> 16674.89s]  It's just kind of like oh, it doesn't it doesn't really make sense. It's kind of just like he's crazy
[16675.53s -> 16684.86s]  Roll credits now, what do we do? I just the whole bus crashing thing and then the little hope shit
[16685.66s -> 16691.74s]  It's almost like they wrote the story and then added this part like the part that it's a guy with like problems afterwards
[16691.98s -> 16701.35s]  You sure as hell took your own sweet time. He's getting worried. I bet you were so who's this this gate has changed
[16701.43s -> 16708.02s]  Is that the brother can't get through? Uh, daniel you mean? Yeah, is that the brother? It's all photo of daniel from like
[16708.64s -> 16715.67s]  1917 or something like that think that's like the navy or something ready?
[16716.50s -> 16727.98s]  I'll push hard from my side ready three two one push holding out good for rusty chain not strong enough two
[16728.46s -> 16734.26s]  One push here. Let me have a shot
[16736.42s -> 16739.54s]  When no one else can do it three two one
[16746.07s -> 16751.91s]  What
[16751.99s -> 16755.75s]  That's how it's done what but it's just him trying to do it himself
[16757.99s -> 16762.23s]  Like so is this I assume all this is real, but it's just one person, right?
[16762.63s -> 16765.75s]  Yeah, you'd have to do that by yourself already concluded this conversation
[16766.47s -> 16768.47s]  By the way, if you just open the door
[16768.87s -> 16773.99s]  Why not just what's the point of the decisions made just open the just have them do like the one two three break it
[16774.07s -> 16776.07s]  What's the point of having any of that happen?
[16776.55s -> 16783.67s]  If it doesn't it doesn't matter. I'm sorry, but we really don't have time to be arguing
[16784.92s -> 16788.18s]  You'll stay here with me won't you
[16789.00s -> 16794.52s]  Looks like he ain't so keen after all if you got something to say to me spit it out
[16800.39s -> 16803.75s]  Do we all right? I just freaked out for a second. I thought like something wrong with the game
[16803.83s -> 16806.39s]  But you do you're doing to do nothing, right?
[16806.63s -> 16807.67s]  Okay
[16807.67s -> 16812.90s]  Let's everyone take a breath. So he's a bus driver. Whatever you say. Well, what did he crash into?
[16813.67s -> 16815.11s]  Did he run over the girl?
[16815.11s -> 16822.47s]  Remember it was like the girl the girl from his because wasn't he in the house at the beginning with the girl the girl
[16822.63s -> 16825.11s]  But he has a memory of her. Yeah, the girl burns
[16825.27s -> 16829.75s]  Can we please and he has a memory of her and inserts her back into the present?
[16831.14s -> 16834.26s]  So this so little hope is is a real town. It's not like a silent hill
[16834.26s -> 16837.06s]  So why is walking is are we just walking in circles?
[16837.70s -> 16843.02s]  Is he just walking in circles and this is just a normal town. Well, that's certainly shut you up
[16844.01s -> 16846.73s]  You don't know what's between the two of us. Well, yeah, we're let's believe
[16847.77s -> 16850.73s]  There's nothing that nothing is real because he's imagining
[16851.53s -> 16853.37s]  Keep out of our business. Okay
[16853.37s -> 16855.77s]  Based on the ending is it weird for me that that's like as
[16856.71s -> 16861.62s]  Just as simple as being just like oh, by the way, the whole thing was a dream, right?
[16861.78s -> 16865.70s]  Like oh every the whole the whole game was a dream keep moving. That's what that is
[16866.98s -> 16868.98s]  It's kind of what mana madan was too though
[16868.98s -> 16872.98s]  I'm going to hang out by the bus while you all do whatever you have because we just inhaled gas
[16873.06s -> 16880.23s]  You want to come along and wait install monsters? None of it was real. Okay, and then we got shot by the uh,
[16881.11s -> 16883.67s]  Military but here's the thing this puts so many
[16884.21s -> 16889.99s]  Unnecessary expectations on the third game because now guess what you and I are going to be like, all right
[16889.99s -> 16893.03s]  What's the fucking weird like dream twist? Is that a real person?
[16893.59s -> 16897.83s]  Rather than to be able to like enjoy the story. Whatever it is. They're all real but they're just like
[16899.85s -> 16902.41s]  He's just talking to himself
[16902.57s -> 16907.61s]  They're just his his people he met in his life. This is some very weird shit going on here
[16908.33s -> 16911.45s]  Yeah, parasol first he loses his pride then he loses his way
[16911.61s -> 16918.14s]  Andrew is the only person who's real but he's actually like 70 years old. Yeah, it's not possible. It's for some
[16919.58s -> 16923.66s]  Always gonna be fun here, but we've got better. So he just he still thinks he's like a teenager
[16924.78s -> 16930.22s]  Yeah, fucking around and tell me what's going on here. Is he got like injured together?
[16931.35s -> 16933.19s]  This is getting ridiculous
[16933.19s -> 16936.76s]  Indulge me
[16936.76s -> 16942.36s]  So he's not actually going anywhere. He's just like imagining them go somewhere because andrew's not going
[16942.52s -> 16945.16s]  And then he walks around and he imagines them walking back
[16959.30s -> 16964.50s]  He's also imagining his brother and sister going out we walk dead straight going. Yeah, that's true. So
[16965.22s -> 16969.38s]  How'd we end up back here?
[16969.46s -> 16971.46s]  Okay, let's try something
[16971.46s -> 16973.30s]  We'll all go together
[16973.30s -> 16976.26s]  We came from that direction. We must be able to go back that way
[16977.67s -> 16979.75s]  I want everyone to stay real close
[16980.47s -> 16982.47s]  No stragglers. Uh
[16982.79s -> 16984.79s]  You want to put us on a kid's line?
[16985.27s -> 16989.19s]  I do like the facial the animation. It's it's like a well made
[16989.91s -> 16993.35s]  Video game, you know what I mean? Like the actual character talking
[16995.64s -> 16999.72s]  Facial animations, it doesn't look bad. I'll be honest. I know this is an unpopular opinion
[16999.88s -> 17006.57s]  I don't mind qte's in these kind of games because they're supposed to be it's supposed to be just like a
[17007.13s -> 17010.66s]  Shit show anyway, admit that is a little odd
[17012.94s -> 17016.46s]  Mostly I played watch dogs three yesterday. See and this looks like
[17016.78s -> 17024.60s]  A thousand times better on the same thing. We are trapped. We can't leave here. Okay, calm down breathe
[17025.54s -> 17027.86s]  There's a rational explanation for what's happening
[17028.42s -> 17030.42s]  Maybe we all died in the crash
[17031.42s -> 17036.38s]  Yeah, nice theory, but i'm pretty sure we're all still alive and kicking. I think it looks all right
[17036.70s -> 17039.10s]  I think this looks good schooling us on creative writing not
[17039.72s -> 17044.06s]  Metaphysics, I know who i'd like to be it's uncanny valley, but it's still you this pissy little field trip
[17044.06s -> 17046.06s]  Better than a lot of the other games I see
[17046.46s -> 17048.46s]  That is way out of line
[17048.94s -> 17054.22s]  I had no way of knowing that damn bus would crash. You can't put that on me. Are you for fucking real?
[17054.70s -> 17060.30s]  Watch your tone. Will you I am doing my best to understand this just like you and the rest of us
[17062.46s -> 17065.10s]  It's probably he's his head is hurting or something
[17068.15s -> 17071.67s]  I think the animation looks pretty good. Someone else thinks they can do a better job
[17072.73s -> 17075.45s]  Step right up at least the facial animation isn't real
[17076.58s -> 17078.58s]  I don't feel like we rushed
[17081.46s -> 17083.46s]  Can everyone just shut up
[17083.54s -> 17087.86s]  Yeah, there he goes and then he's looking around helping us find help or getting us out of here
[17089.75s -> 17091.11s]  he's right
[17091.11s -> 17095.35s]  Bitching at each other isn't gonna play the other six sequels they have planned in the future with italics
[17095.83s -> 17097.83s]  Thank you. Uh, yeah, i'll be 41
[17098.39s -> 17100.63s]  Now let's be logical
[17100.63s -> 17103.35s]  The fog is between us. I don't think that's
[17103.99s -> 17108.47s]  Realistically going to release us and town so let's head that way
[17109.03s -> 17115.42s]  I don't get how heading further away from the bus helps. There is nothing on the bus
[17115.66s -> 17117.66s]  We can use to get help
[17117.82s -> 17120.86s]  In town, there will be people a working phone something
[17121.66s -> 17126.22s]  It pains me to admit but he's right. There's nowhere else we can go except into that damn town
[17126.94s -> 17129.29s]  Sounds like a plan to me
[17129.29s -> 17133.45s]  You're leaving me. All right. So now somebody said this in chat. Come on, let's go with them
[17133.61s -> 17141.42s]  Andrew just cuz doesn't do anything. He just kind of stands around and goes. Yeah, how'd you get it? I get it now
[17141.90s -> 17149.35s]  No biggie must have got it when the bus crashed. Oh, it's from like the 17 times. I got uh smokered in the last left for dead game
[17152.97s -> 17158.01s]  They can't have the fog unless andrew goes there. Why did you say we might all be dead? Oh, wait a minute. That's true
[17158.09s -> 17162.01s]  Is that that's true? Isn't it cable show about how your brain keeps going for a while after you?
[17163.11s -> 17167.51s]  You know you die forget about it what they said didn't really stack up
[17169.18s -> 17172.30s]  I don't like the look of that place at all. So, okay, what's with the cat though?
[17172.38s -> 17177.02s]  They won't ask for id this is a lot of like red herrings and they specifically go out of the way to be like
[17177.10s -> 17182.14s]  Do you think we're all dead? No, we're not because we know these dumb players are gonna say that hey over here
[17186.78s -> 17188.42s]  And we did
[17188.42s -> 17191.14s]  He's imagining this private. This is such a great idea. I did
[17191.86s -> 17194.98s]  Cat we should check it out cat is food. There could be a phone inside
[17196.02s -> 17200.54s]  I'll go in and take a look around and the point is to be ready. Yeah, this is just a bunch of red herrings in the game
[17200.54s -> 17203.06s]  We'll be right behind you
[17203.14s -> 17207.22s]  And it's it's kind of funny that the end, you know, what are we going with the whole little hope storyline?
[17207.30s -> 17209.54s]  Is there something between you just made up in his head?
[17210.02s -> 17214.02s]  We're really going to get into it. Well, yeah because he's going he's exploring little hope
[17214.58s -> 17217.54s]  And making up the backstory for me as he reads
[17218.18s -> 17220.18s]  the museum
[17220.26s -> 17221.30s]  Lore
[17221.30s -> 17223.30s]  That's like that's ridiculous
[17223.54s -> 17228.74s]  So that's that's another layer each of these little hope buildings reading a blurb and then he gets lore grabbed
[17228.98s -> 17230.98s]  And it vents like a
[17231.62s -> 17237.22s]  Backstory for it though. He's just he's just like creative writing inside of his own head
[17250.18s -> 17256.41s]  Okay, but but he's not here. Why is this conversation happening on screen if he's not here?
[17256.81s -> 17262.70s]  I need to know 100 percent. I can rely on you that you'll never let me down
[17263.80s -> 17268.86s]  We should catch up. So i'm in the andrew group and you're in the actually not happening group. So he's simultaneously
[17269.56s -> 17271.56s]  making up multiple conversations
[17272.12s -> 17274.12s]  50 to 100 feet away from each other
[17275.00s -> 17281.00s]  Someone in chat said that john is a creative writing professor laughing my ass off. Oh, that is true
[17281.56s -> 17293.45s]  But there there are specific portions where andrew is somewhere else and there's two people walking around like a mile away
[17294.01s -> 17297.69s]  Is how is he how's he making how does he know what's going on over there? How's he making that up?
[17300.95s -> 17305.59s]  So this dude is real and exists. This is tanya's boyfriend. Oh, you know, hold on dude
[17306.55s -> 17310.39s]  Pause it pause it. This is important. Um, we need to put we need to put like a thing on the screen
[17311.18s -> 17314.14s]  That just says like oh, hey, by the way, uh spoilers for the fucking whole game
[17314.14s -> 17316.14s]  We did and we're just talking about everything that happened
[17317.43s -> 17324.17s]  It's a bit late for that. Is it late for that pretty late. Hold on. Let me just do it
[17324.49s -> 17327.51s]  Because I feel like if it's like oh, what's what's this somebody's streaming this game?
[17327.51s -> 17331.11s]  Oh, they're right at the beginning of the game. Cool. That's the guy the guy's uh, he made it all up
[17331.19s -> 17360.38s]  I'm just gonna i'm just gonna put it on quick. Okay, let's go. Wait. What is this? How do I have four x files here?
[17360.54s -> 17371.67s]  All right, all right. You ready? There we go. Yep. Did you just put fuckface run again?
[17372.49s -> 17374.49s]  No, I said second playthrough spoiler talk
[17383.85s -> 17388.97s]  Oh my god, the title of my stream is that stupid little in-joke with like 10 people in pre-stream. Whatever
[17401.82s -> 17403.66s]  I mean, let's be fair
[17403.66s -> 17408.26s]  The game the game did come out today. All right, i'm good
[17412.87s -> 17414.87s]  It didn't release like six hours ago
[17415.03s -> 17418.87s]  So, I mean come on if you planned on playing this but I and you just open the stream
[17419.19s -> 17425.03s]  And the stream opens you get your fucking tostitos pizza roll ad and then all of a sudden it's like oh tostitos pizza rolls
[17425.51s -> 17428.95s]  Heat them up. And he made the whole thing up in his head. Yeah. Yeah, everyone's andrew
[17428.95s -> 17436.54s]  He made everything up. Don't you think you'd be like well fucking great. Thanks. Save me 30 bucks. No, that's true
[17437.67s -> 17453.48s]  All right, you ready? I can spend that 30 bucks on pizza rolls. How much is a bag of pizza rolls like 10 bucks 8 bucks?
[17454.04s -> 17460.81s]  Depends on the size of the bag. Hi there. How you doing?
[17462.23s -> 17465.51s]  These developers only cash flow is you and italics. Excuse me
[17466.23s -> 17472.31s]  But we're that's not even true. This is like a really this is a popular franchise people are buying this will it please
[17473.51s -> 17476.07s]  Come on. That's funny. What is
[17477.59s -> 17478.71s]  Okay
[17478.71s -> 17481.11s]  Uh that guy could have just solved the whole game
[17481.91s -> 17487.03s]  Yeah, he could have just elaborated. Yeah, show us a thick one tonight. So thick it's stopping us from leaving
[17489.99s -> 17495.69s]  Yeah, yeah, I know that feeling like right now he's just kind of egging us on maybe find a phone or something
[17496.01s -> 17498.25s]  Yeah, all right. Hold on, but don't come look at this
[17498.89s -> 17501.91s]  Come on. How about a game who's playing the darts?
[17502.71s -> 17507.43s]  Seriously, you want to throw darts? Oh, you're not listening to the oh hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on pause
[17507.83s -> 17511.19s]  But we got to start over like from this chapter
[17511.51s -> 17516.07s]  Because the last time we did manamadan, uh, if you're player one or player two you get to see the other
[17517.30s -> 17522.18s]  You're you're just gonna literally see the whole shit. You just saw for the entire game go the same
[17522.74s -> 17524.90s]  Like we flipped remember? Oh
[17527.83s -> 17529.48s]  Uh
[17529.48s -> 17532.84s]  You can restart it from this same chapter though. Okay. Yeah. All right
[17532.92s -> 17538.26s]  So you have to then you have to uh host the game. Oh, no, no, wait
[17538.82s -> 17541.46s]  It's like a wiimote thing. We're at that menu. We have to press
[17542.18s -> 17546.49s]  All right, let's let's swap. Let's go. Is it a wiimote thing?
[17546.49s -> 17564.15s]  Where like whoever presses the button first gets first player don't play alone
[17566.07s -> 17569.51s]  So do you have to invite me? Do we know that? Yeah, okay. Yeah, listen
[17570.78s -> 17572.78s]  Oh, you are invited
[17572.78s -> 17575.27s]  I got an invite
[17575.27s -> 17576.87s]  Oh cool
[17580.58s -> 17585.06s]  Okay, never mind. Uh, they made it worse. You actually I can't I
[17585.91s -> 17592.09s]  According to the devs. I have not ever played this game before my other news story or scene selection. Oh
[17595.56s -> 17597.16s]  All right, well, it's okay
[17597.16s -> 17606.97s]  Let's see if we can wiimote it
[17606.97s -> 17607.13s]  Okay
[17607.13s -> 17612.25s]  I'm gonna so I guess beware if you end up playing this game with a friend and then try and play it
[17613.22s -> 17615.40s]  Without them. Yeah, if you for some reason
[17615.48s -> 17616.52s]  Well, it is
[17616.60s -> 17621.96s]  I would have lost all progress like if we were halfway through and we stopped and then never played it again for some reason
[17623.10s -> 17629.66s]  We are doing shared story though. Maybe that's the reason why because you're sharing it with me, but I also bought it
[17631.42s -> 17634.54s]  Yeah, couldn't one person buy this game and then like steam
[17636.66s -> 17643.29s]  Link to someone else. Yeah, you can you can do remote play with this game. So why did we both buy it?
[17646.49s -> 17648.49s]  Because it's better than dealing with like
[17649.12s -> 17655.24s]  500 millisecond lag probably oh you can't
[17655.56s -> 17659.03s]  Oh, wait, wait, wait, hold on. Maybe you can't the thing pops up
[17659.35s -> 17662.63s]  When I when anytime you open the game don't you get the thing where it says remote play together
[17662.71s -> 17676.95s]  I get that in the corner. It's only for split screen. No, why would it pop up when I open this game?
[17677.03s -> 17686.09s]  That doesn't happen on every game. I open. Oh, here we go. All right, so if you what if you hit click first
[17686.57s -> 17695.80s]  I I don't think it matters, but i'll click because i'm just player two. Well game does have local co-op. Yeah, I think there's a
[17696.95s -> 17700.55s]  Yeah, there's a pass the controller. Yeah, so I guess you can do the you can do it that way
[17701.78s -> 17703.78s]  How did you pass the controller in mana madame?
[17705.06s -> 17710.41s]  I'm, not sure that passed the control was in mana madame. I think it was just shared story or solo. Maybe it was
[17716.22s -> 17718.22s]  Next game. No, this is it
[17720.06s -> 17733.83s]  Sorry, my leg bumped rb. Hey quit bumping. Oh, are we are we in hell?
[17735.42s -> 17739.18s]  Is the game trying to tell us something is this is this where is this where we pull the plug?
[17740.10s -> 17742.54s]  This might be a pull the plug
[17743.10s -> 17746.60s]  Can you do it? No
[17747.56s -> 17749.85s]  Time to rip pull plug
[17749.85s -> 17753.95s]  It's probably better that way because if we can't even swap we're just gonna see 100
[17754.65s -> 17759.70s]  The same thing anyways, unless we started a new game. Yeah, it was fun. It was but look
[17759.78s -> 17764.66s]  It's always enjoyable to play like a funny crazy scary game with friend. It just is
[17765.70s -> 17769.46s]  No, I mean, I I enjoyed the experience. I just wish it was better
[17770.02s -> 17774.70s]  True, but yeah, um
[17776.01s -> 17778.01s]  That's it
[17778.92s -> 17779.88s]  Uh
[17779.88s -> 17781.00s]  I
[17781.00s -> 17785.66s]  Thanks for playing taleks. It's always a pleasure. See you next year when we do the next one. Oh
[17787.58s -> 17800.97s]  Will there be a 2021? It's it's got a sequel. Yeah, that's gonna come out. Yeah, that's uh, it has to uh, that's taleks
[17802.31s -> 17806.98s]  Somebody one of the mods want to just span his uh channel, please
[17808.74s -> 17815.11s]  span it span, uh, and that was fun. Thank you everyone for uh for
[17816.28s -> 17822.20s]  Watching this shit. I I liked it and I didn't like it at the same time
[17823.59s -> 17827.59s]  Yeah, it's kind of it's in a weird spot, but I still am glad I enjoyed the experience
[17831.22s -> 17833.62s]  All right, just frozen screen on the last cutscene still
[17834.84s -> 17838.36s]  It was we had fun for five hours that that's that's a five hour
[17839.48s -> 17847.80s]  Experience the game was really four hours. We just kind of like that's why why was it only four who who else is playing this game?
[17848.20s -> 17857.78s]  That is taking six hours to beat you must just be looking at every single piece of material
[17860.89s -> 17865.21s]  all right, I gotta I gotta watch this quick video and then uh, i'm gonna end the stream but
[17866.06s -> 17869.42s]  Uh taleks good night. Thanks for playing. See you again next time
[17870.07s -> 17870.95s]  uh
[17870.95s -> 17877.78s]  Sorry everyone that um, you had to watch loser pov on derma's channel as he killed every single cow
[17877.78s -> 17879.54s]  I'm just kidding. It was fun
[17879.54s -> 17886.89s]  All right, take it easy, man. Bye. All right. Um, this is a spoiler for one of the endings, but holy shit
[17886.97s -> 17897.91s]  You weren't kidding. This is actually this is actually an ending. I can't fucking believe it. Are you shitting me?
[17898.07s -> 17906.10s]  Thank god. This didn't happen. Let's watch it by the way me watching
[17906.10s -> 17911.54s]  It does not mean a fluke diving accident the day before my high school graduation left me completely paralyzed
[17911.78s -> 17924.46s]  But a stem cell treatment helped me move my arms again. Why is this 12 minutes?
[17924.70s -> 17941.66s]  I thought this is supposed to be the ending why am I getting so many what's the five nights at freddy's among us ad
[17941.98s -> 17950.47s]  That was just every meme in a banner. Okay. Let me let me let me quit out of this
[17956.55s -> 17964.41s]  Uh, all right, let me get this bigger. So this is what could have happened. This is one of the endings by the way
[17964.73s -> 17984.39s]  Okay, here we go. Let's watch it get it out. Get it out of 144p. All right. I will all right. Let's see
[17993.43s -> 18009.24s]  Watching this does not mean I did it. It just we're watching what could have happened. I can't fucking believe it
[18009.98s -> 18014.15s]  I can't believe it. No way
[18016.18s -> 18019.56s]  I really dodged a bullet here. No way
[18031.06s -> 18034.66s]  Holy shit. I can't believe I was had to give a thousand subs
[18044.62s -> 18048.01s]  I can't fucking believe it
[18048.09s -> 18062.14s]  So what could have what could have gone differently with that would have happened if you didn't shoot the gun
[18064.57s -> 18077.16s]  Holy fucking shit. I almost didn't I almost didn't fire the gun. You don't shoot at vince then there's no cops
[18078.76s -> 18082.98s]  Thank god. I shot the gun
[18082.98s -> 18084.98s]  Here's the fucking best part about this
[18085.38s -> 18093.72s]  A bunch of you guys knew that was possible and were absolutely trying to push me towards the decisions that made it possible
[18095.61s -> 18099.93s]  Is that why when that came up everyone was like don't shoot him. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Don't shoot
[18106.96s -> 18109.52s]  And the trial makes a difference too. That's ridiculous
[18115.69s -> 18121.69s]  All right. I'll see you guys tomorrow for halloween vr. We're gonna start with the walking dead
