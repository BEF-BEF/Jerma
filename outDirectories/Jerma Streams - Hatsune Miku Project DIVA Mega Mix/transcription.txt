[1.66s -> 9.78s]  Okay, how you doing? Um, so I got it open here. Oh, there's no BRB music, shit. That's my bad.
[9.78s -> 17.67s]  Well, there will be BRB music in a second. Not my BRB music, but whatever BRB music you're about
[17.67s -> 28.25s]  to hear. Um, alright, I need to change the title, don't I? Where's Daffy? Um, what should I title?
[28.25s -> 35.18s]  I don't know anything about Miku. What do I title the game? Because I mean, it won by a fucking
[35.18s -> 57.10s]  landslide, so. Keep Where's Daffy? Where's Miku? Why would Daffy Duck be in this game? I'm gonna
[57.10s -> 63.05s]  be honest. I'm gonna put an honest title here, I think. I've never played a Miku game in my life.
[63.05s -> 75.78s]  How about I've never played a Miku game in my life. The VR one, that was not a Miku game,
[75.78s -> 85.59s]  that was um, Space Channel 5. That wasn't a Miku game. What is the name? What's the title of this?
[85.59s -> 93.83s]  Hatsune Miku. Colorful Stage. Project Diva Megamix. Megamix Plus. Project Diva Future Tone DX.
[93.83s -> 103.35s]  Project Diva Arcade Future Tone. What game do I have? Project Diva Megamix Plus. I think that's
[103.35s -> 112.89s]  the one, right? Okay, I've never played a Miku game in my life. We're about to find out how this
[112.89s -> 127.29s]  goes. Uh, let's, let's go for it. Should I use a controller or a mouse? I feel like controller,
[127.29s -> 153.29s]  probably. Is it a rhythm game? It's controller, okay. Um, I need to recapture this window. Okay,
[153.29s -> 163.74s]  can I put this in a, can I put this in a display full screen with frame? What does with frame mean?
[163.74s -> 170.42s]  Oh Jesus, that's not what I wanted to do, but whatever. Um, hold on, I need to re-add this.
[170.42s -> 194.02s]  Where is it? What do you mean, looking for game to capture? It's here. It's right there.
[194.02s -> 208.63s]  Oh my God. Okay, there we go. All right, what is, what is it? Full screen with frame? No frame.
[208.63s -> 231.00s]  What's that mean? I'm just going to do 1080. That was weird. All right, let's go. We're looking,
[231.00s -> 257.03s]  hold on, I'm trying to move this thing. Clean your camera lens. There's nothing on it. There's
[257.03s -> 269.46s]  nothing on it. It's fine. There's nothing on it. Okay, time for Miku, everybody. You ready? Put it
[269.46s -> 277.32s]  in the dishwasher. Put, put it in the dishwasher. Okay, let's go. Is this a good enough volume? You
[277.32s -> 284.38s]  want me to turn it up? This is really loud for me. All right, so what do I do? What do we want
[284.38s -> 294.65s]  me to do? What do I do? Rhythm game? Custom gallery online store options rhythm game, right?
[294.65s -> 316.06s]  So what do I, how do I play? Let the tutorial begin. Hold down the pause button. What? Wait,
[316.06s -> 323.38s]  what? What was that? I, I, what do I have to do? Here comes the B icon. Press the corresponding
[323.38s -> 332.52s]  button or key. What? Why is, what's with the left and right thing? Here comes the A icon.
[332.52s -> 363.21s]  That was perfect. Shut up. Left or right? That's, left is R. That's weird. I don't like that. That's
[363.21s -> 403.62s]  weird. That's freaking me out. Second. Are there any lyrics? Same time.
[408.18s -> 468.50s]  You know, God bless the bassist. He's got to be up there all night. Left and both right. Okay,
[468.50s -> 472.47s]  I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it.
[472.47s -> 475.43s]  When you see hold under a target, hold the button or key down to increase your score. Okay, you got
[475.43s -> 504.36s]  it. One, two, three, four. How long do I hold it for? As long as I want? Oh, all right.
[520.60s -> 527.48s]  This band, they're waiting for me to start the song and I'm just on stage like,
[530.92s -> 544.71s]  yeah, who's ready? It's like, geez, fucking hurry up, man. Like, let's go. When the rainbow icon
[544.71s -> 561.83s]  shows up, that's your chance to spice up the music video. It's like a midi version of this song.
[563.85s -> 581.96s]  Quack, quack, quack. What the fuck?
[602.58s -> 609.38s]  This is what? Am I going to get in trouble from streaming this audio?
[609.38s -> 626.10s]  This is literally just like songs. What? How is this wrong? It's B. What are you talking about?
[626.10s -> 648.86s]  Look. It's not wrong. What's happening? What's going on? What's going on? Look,
[649.50s -> 670.06s]  I don't understand what's fucking happening. It's wrong? What are you talking about? You
[670.06s -> 676.06s]  ignored the tutorial? No, I fucking didn't. The layout is set to the wrong controller.
[680.23s -> 701.56s]  What? It thinks B is A. It thinks A is B. What? I just did the tutorial with it set to the right
[701.56s -> 712.60s]  thing. What the fuck is it talking about? It's set to a Nintendo controller. What?
[721.67s -> 725.35s]  No, I don't want to customize Miku. I want to customize my fucking controller.
[725.35s -> 785.22s]  It was there? Where? What is all this? Y is Y. X is X. B is A.
[790.50s -> 794.98s]  What the fuck was this all about? I literally just did the tutorial with these settings.
[799.46s -> 811.48s]  I don't care. Okay, left is left. Right is left. No, right is right. Oh my god, dude.
[820.01s -> 824.25s]  Shut up. Shut this fucking music up. I don't, what's going on?
[826.62s -> 837.85s]  What? Multi press up plus left. What's happening? I'm so confused right now. Multi press up and left
[837.85s -> 854.89s]  is Y and X. Um, huh. Unbind these. Up plus down, Y, A. This wasn't in the goddamn tutorial, dude.
[855.77s -> 901.10s]  Can I leave now? I don't like that song anymore. Blackjack. Blackjack. Okay, let me see if I can
[901.10s -> 968.66s]  actually play the game. Here we go. That's a pretty good hand. I think the tambourine sound is fucking
[968.66s -> 996.70s]  with my head. I feel like I'm ruining the song. All this for one hand of Blackjack. There's like
[996.70s -> 999.58s]  three or four people at this table smoking cigarettes just like,
[1002.26s -> 1060.70s]  so did you, did you bust or what? I'm sick of this. Oh, dealer had 20. You all lose.
[1062.07s -> 1090.57s]  Try again. All right, how do I turn off the tambourine? How do I turn the tambourine off?
[1090.57s -> 1106.04s]  Button effects? Bell? Oh, okay. Woodblock? Let's try woodblock. Slide C. Wind chimes. Laser.
[1106.76s -> 1123.80s]  What's wrong? All right. Okay. All right. It's like too much stimulation. I have to get out of this.
[1124.60s -> 1229.86s]  Cat food. Butterfly? I never heard this fucking song before in my life.
[1229.86s -> 1266.15s]  How am I supposed to keep the rhythm if I never heard it? What the fuck?
[1266.31s -> 1331.37s]  Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. I didn't clear it, but like, I don't know the, I don't know how the song
[1331.37s -> 1336.47s]  goes the first time I've ever heard it. I can't sing the lyrics to something I've never heard.
[1336.47s -> 1338.79s]  Hey, dude, you got to keep the rhythm. You know how the song goes.
[1339.43s -> 1376.76s]  Like, I don't fuck. Oh, I've never heard it. What? Oh, thank you. Turn off the fucking tambourine.
[1376.76s -> 1428.20s]  Dude, I'm like in a front fucking row. Go Miku. All right, you're coming with us. Row it up. All
[1428.20s -> 1430.36s]  right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All
[1430.36s -> 1434.52s]  right. Stop. I'm going to try that again. I can't have two headphones in. I can hear this in my
[1434.52s -> 1439.83s]  sleep. One more time. One more time. All right. All right. No, turn off the... Go back to the song
[1439.83s -> 1450.30s]  list. Turn off... It's too hard. Get me out of here. No, I don't want to hear... How do I turn the song
[1450.30s -> 1457.98s]  off right now? I don't want to hear like... I just want to change the fucking button configs.
[1472.30s -> 1492.25s]  Miku, I'm such a big fan. I'm a fucking footpecker. How do I turn it off? How do I turn it off?
[1497.88s -> 1520.41s]  Options, not customization. Like that? All right, let's go. This is a bit too much for you,
[1520.41s -> 1625.83s]  don't you think? What the fuck? Here it comes. Here comes the chorus. Next game,
[1628.68s -> 1633.88s]  80% of you said to play this. You're going to have to fucking deal with the people in the chat that
[1633.88s -> 1729.46s]  made me play this. And by the way, it's stellar. You're almost 40. Play the banana song. First,
[1729.46s -> 1736.12s]  I need to fucking fix this. I feel like I've been stuck in a dream for the last 25 spray minutes.
[1737.08s -> 1749.27s]  Okay. Do you... No. How do I save this fucking changes? Oh my God. Thank goodness. Here we go.
[1752.54s -> 1775.02s]  Please play the banana one. Whoa, hold on a minute. All right. All right. All right. Let's go. All
[1775.02s -> 1844.52s]  right. That's so much better. I would go to a Miku concert. Do they serve alcohol at a Miku concert?
[1845.16s -> 1851.11s]  Like I would just get drunk and just like sit there and nod. Can you drink? Can you serve alcohol?
[1860.09s -> 1873.27s]  They don't? I feel like I'm talking over a vacuum cleaner. It's loud for me. Hopefully it's not this
[1873.27s -> 1904.14s]  loud for you. I would be pissed off because I would definitely have like a few too many, right? And be
[1904.14s -> 1908.46s]  pissed because I can't get up and dance. So I'd be just sitting there in the corner like this, just
[1908.46s -> 1978.86s]  like, I want to get up and dance so bad. This is a long song, isn't it? Somebody's leaning in now.
[1980.18s -> 2011.06s]  Dude, you good? You good? Yeah. Yep. Man, you get up and dance. No, no, no. No, I'm all right right here.
[2011.06s -> 2018.22s]  I'm cool. I'm cool right here. Dude, come on. Let's go. Let's go dance. Yeah. No, just you go.
[2018.22s -> 2028.55s]  I'll be there in a minute. You go. All right. How about dermatology?
[2028.55s -> 2057.88s]  Oh, that's cool. Do all the songs have their own kind of backgrounds? That's actually pretty cool.
[2057.88s -> 2128.30s]  I like this. All right. You guys know, I thought Miku was a real person until like a year and a
[2128.30s -> 2237.37s]  half ago. I thought it was a gorilla scenario. Here we go. I think I'm ready for hard. One more
[2237.37s -> 2279.66s]  time. One more time. Let's go. Important notice. Hatsune Miku. Alcohol consumption is prohibited
[2279.66s -> 2296.25s]  both inside the live venue and the exhibition hall. All right. Well, then all right. All right.
[2296.25s -> 2345.43s]  I don't need to. What's another good one? Let's do hard. That's a lot of songs. All right. Okay.
[2348.50s -> 2373.16s]  It's all right. Seven and a half difficulty, man. Are you serious? Oh, by the way, should I put,
[2373.16s -> 2384.76s]  this is like flashing lights in this. Should I put a warning? Probably should. I'll put a warning in.
[2384.76s -> 2401.64s]  Title. Warning. Flashing lights. Yeah, there's like really bright flashing colors and stuff.
[2411.48s -> 2422.87s]  All right. Hold on. I wasn't ready for that. Am I ready for hard? Do you think I can do hard?
[2422.87s -> 2434.06s]  Turn the difficulty down. Oh, shit. Too late. All right. Is this everybody's favorite song
[2434.06s -> 2485.72s]  of the whole game? Let's go. Let's get perfect. Oh, shit. The animal just hit. The animal just hit.
[2485.72s -> 2497.46s]  Oh, my God. That was fucking impossible. Lower difficulty. Maybe a little bit lower of difficult.
[2501.82s -> 2505.42s]  No, shit. All right. Hold on. I probably do it with one eye.
[2673.77s -> 2686.58s]  Oh, they turned it up. They like dialed it up. They turned it up. It was like,
[2689.86s -> 2731.06s]  I wasn't ready for it. Dude, your mic sucks. I know, man. This one sounds pretty good.
[2731.06s -> 2967.14s]  I can't fucking do those. Fuck you. Let's go. Did I win? It's really hard. It's really hard.
[2967.14s -> 2987.18s]  What's mega mix? What's the difference? I feel like this is going to be impossible. Start music
[2987.18s -> 3009.74s]  video. How do I do? I'm going to do the music video. All right, let's go. Oh, my eyelid. How
[3009.74s -> 3081.90s]  do I play? I'll do my own. I'll do my own rhythm game. Get me out of here. Where's the one that
[3081.90s -> 3150.73s]  goes... Where's that one? Holy shit. I just want to know. I'm just curious. An auctioneer.
[3198.18s -> 3207.45s]  I'm going to do a hundred bucks. I don't know if that's what you were saying. I don't know
[3207.45s -> 3240.97s]  what to do there. That's all of them. This is from Clayfighter. This is the Clayfighter solo.
[3242.52s -> 3294.31s]  The theme from Clayfighter. Oh, it's a good spastic controller. Settle down. No, I don't
[3294.31s -> 3300.23s]  want to retry it. This microphone keeps breaking my sound. What does it sound like? Can I hear?
[3300.23s -> 3308.46s]  Clip that. I want to see what that sounds like. The mic blew out. Why does the mic keep blowing
[3308.46s -> 3315.96s]  out, man? I want to see what it sounds like. The edible really did hit, huh? It was right at the
[3315.96s -> 3342.74s]  end of the song too. That clip is not available anymore. Did I get fucking shut down? It sounds
[3342.74s -> 3356.04s]  so fucked up. It's like, that's so funny. It sounds like such shit. It's very sudden, loud
[3356.04s -> 3364.18s]  movements. It just goes, no. Okay, let's keep going. That's actually kind of a good thing,
[3364.18s -> 3372.86s]  though, because when I scream like a little shithead, it cuts it off so you can't hear it.
[3372.86s -> 3380.10s]  It protects you from hearing me sound like a little shit. Okay, let's go back to the song list.
[3380.10s -> 3411.21s]  Okay, World is Mine and Po-Pi-Po. All right, World is Mine and Po-Pi-Po. There are 178 songs.
[3411.21s -> 3513.35s]  Po-Pi-Po? Oh, that's not it. Where's P? This one? Po-Pi-Po, Po-Pi-Po, Po-Pi-Po, Po-Pi-Po, Po-Pi-Po, Po-Pi-Po.
[3538.52s -> 3563.08s]  Wee. Wee. I'm gonna fucking lose.
[3606.55s -> 3634.63s]  Did I win? Oh my god. All right, the next one is, what was it called? Something? I keep getting,
[3634.63s -> 3669.85s]  I keep failing. 58%. The World is Mine, okay. World's End and Black Rock Shooter. I have to
[3669.85s -> 3675.43s]  at least get 60% on one of these on hard. You know what it is? I'm too good for normal and not
[3675.43s -> 3680.39s]  good enough for hard. Every rhythm game that has the button presses like this, it's always tricky for me.
[3680.39s -> 3705.75s]  Okay.
[3777.32s -> 3781.24s]  Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it.
[3799.45s -> 3830.79s]  Hold it.
[3830.79s -> 3856.70s]  what the fuck did i fail again 54 fucking percent man oh i'm too good for normal too bad for

[4066.46s -> 4152.06s]  cool oh shit this okay listen when they're on the i can't talk because there's a fucking song playing
[4152.06s -> 4156.54s]  okay when it says the buttons you need to press and they're like i my eyes have to go frog eyes
