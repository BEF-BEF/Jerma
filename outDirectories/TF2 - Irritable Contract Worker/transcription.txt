[0.00s -> 17.89s]  I think we're like 20% of the way through this contract. I apologize. I was gonna start the video a while ago and it was gonna be a- I only play as the classic!
[17.89s -> 24.32s]  But I ended up like killing two people and then like didn't record and then like started recording.
[24.32s -> 31.75s]  So now we're really recording and there's a guy in the water. I gotta get this guy. He's fucking dead. Guy's dead.
[31.75s -> 39.93s]  Alright, well, welcome to the video, guys, where we shoot fucking people in the water that have been dead for like 20 minutes.
[39.93s -> 47.61s]  Can I kill this guy? I know it wasn't a headshot, but this is going a lot faster than I initially thought it was going to go.
[47.61s -> 55.92s]  See if I can get a no scope here. There we go. If I do that a few more times, the contract will be finished.
[55.92s -> 59.92s]  I was under the impression that it was gonna be like, oh man, it's gonna take like fucking two hours.
[59.92s -> 68.56s]  I missed that one. This is a good place to sit though. No, it's not because there's spies that come behind you.
[68.56s -> 76.06s]  What an irritated beginning to this video. I sound really irritated. Do I sound really irritated right now?
[76.06s -> 82.06s]  Well, let's get rid of that. Let's like shake off the irritation. Hold on. Still irritated.
[82.06s -> 88.13s]  As you can tell, I was still a little irritated. I gotta cast off the spell that is the irritation.
[88.13s -> 95.43s]  And how we do that is I no scope the first guy that I see and then all of a sudden like I'm gonna be fine, you know?
[95.43s -> 103.94s]  First person I see literally that comes in this doorway is going to wipe my slate clean. This guy, right? This guy. Ready? Ready? Ready? Ready?
[103.94s -> 116.49s]  Still irritated. No, that wasn't a headshot. Still slightly irritated. No, I'm not allowed to do that.
[116.49s -> 126.57s]  Uh, I'll get him. I'll get him. I like didn't even let go. I'll get him. Come here.
[126.57s -> 134.41s]  I was hoping I was gonna like luckily shoot him right in the face. I'm being so useless right now. Please. Please.
[134.41s -> 143.73s]  I know I'm still a little upset. I can't get it off. I got a headshot this guy. I've got to get this guy right now.
[143.73s -> 153.74s]  Come on. I'm in the right spot for this. And he's pistoling me. This guy's pistoling me and I can't even shoot him.
[153.74s -> 169.66s]  Oh, how irritating. What just happened? Oh, right.
[169.66s -> 179.77s]  I'm so focused on the top stairs. I just have total tunnel vision. I had tunnel vision on sniper without being zoomed in.
[179.77s -> 187.34s]  Wait for it. Wait for it. It's the releasing the button on the finger is what's giving me the finger. Get away from me.
[187.34s -> 202.19s]  I don't know. I promise I'm not a spy. Come on down here. Show me. Show me your face. I'd love to see it.
[202.19s -> 208.27s]  Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. He went to the point. He went to the point. He went to the point. How?
[208.27s -> 226.68s]  I don't know what happened today. Did I like, did somebody spit in my coffee today? Like, why am I this like irritable? I shouldn't be.
[226.68s -> 235.25s]  Maybe I like woke up on the wrong side of the bed. That's pop. Oh, guys, I feel like a new man.
[235.25s -> 242.25s]  Hey, you know that you feel like a new man. Well, that I feel, you know, I feel like a new man right now. Let's play some Team Fortress 2.
[242.25s -> 246.25s]  My coffee was like my coffee was really good this morning. Nobody's spitting.
[246.25s -> 258.25s]  Nobody definitely spit in my coffee this morning. This weapon is fucking impossible to use.
[258.25s -> 267.65s]  This weapon is so hard to use. Holy fuck. If this weapon wasn't the worst weapon in the whole game, I would have killed that guy.
[267.65s -> 273.85s]  No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't get irritated again. This is going to be a good place to finish this up.
[273.85s -> 285.98s]  That is a spy that you are a spy. Perfect opportunity. Fuck me, man. He's going to get backstabbed.
[285.98s -> 294.88s]  There's nothing and I could have prevented that. Don't don't do it. Do you see how long that took?
[294.88s -> 303.28s]  That took so long to be able to headshot that guy. That guy did a little dance and ducked out of the corner.
[303.28s -> 310.30s]  And then by the time he came back, I was ready to shoot him. It's a long charge up time.
[310.30s -> 314.30s]  I lowered my sensitivity a shitload to try to compensate for my mom, my fucking lord.
[314.30s -> 321.62s]  I have to concentrate so much while I do this. I feel like I'm taking a math test.
[321.62s -> 329.69s]  Did I get a good grade on my ultra concentrate math exam? Fucking Algebra 2, whatever the hell it is.
[330.69s -> 338.75s]  This is this is the opportunity where this gun is supposed to shine around a corner like that.
[338.75s -> 344.14s]  Only got to do that a couple more times. You know, we got a good opportunity right here.
[344.14s -> 351.18s]  Come on, bring it on. I'll shoot you through the fucking laundry chute.
[351.18s -> 358.94s]  No spies, no spies. I can almost be done with this contract. I thought the flowers, I thought those were stickies on the red team.
[358.94s -> 366.16s]  Freaks me out for a second. That's me. That's me. I almost didn't understand what was going on.
[366.16s -> 368.16s]  I just had an out of body experience.
[379.58s -> 384.19s]  Screw it. I'll hit you with the ham.
[387.35s -> 390.35s]  Going underneath that thing. I got like bumped my head.
[390.35s -> 396.04s]  That's it. We're done. We're done. We are done. We're done. We're done.
[396.04s -> 400.30s]  I got it. We're done. Contract over.
[400.30s -> 405.30s]  For good measure, we're just gonna sit in the fucking water. Why am I still on fire? Come on, please submerge.
[405.30s -> 410.11s]  We're done. Give me my box. Give me my box.
[410.11s -> 417.64s]  What do I got? I want to see what I get. Come on. Have it be something good. Something good.
[417.64s -> 422.64s]  Congratulations. You have just been given the opportunity to spend $2.50.
[422.64s -> 426.02s]  Fuck it. We're doing it.
[426.02s -> 431.64s]  Yes, I'm sure. I'm sure. Let's see. Was this worth it? Was it worth it? What's inside?
[431.64s -> 450.83s]  Holy shit. Holy shit. Okay. That's worth it. That's factory new purple ranges. That's... Oh my fucking lord.
[450.83s -> 458.35s]  And it's a sniper. My mood just went from irritated and upset and annoyed into...
[458.35s -> 466.90s]  Alright. Okay. I got factory new purple range. I'm not even close to being irritated anymore.
