[0.63s -> 5.75s]  Hold on, wait a minute. Maximum Action won the poll? When did that happen?
[18.68s -> 22.52s]  I... there has to be some type of... no, there's got to be some type of
[23.56s -> 35.62s]  coordinated effort here. Because Maxim... Fishing Planet. It's already open. I'm gonna play it. It's
[35.62s -> 49.05s]  already open. I've already installed it. Well then just uninstall it. That uses data.
[51.19s -> 73.21s]  I've seen a lot of people talking about this title. It's very simple. Yep. That's it. Yep.
[73.21s -> 79.96s]  Somebody voting over and over again. Well, the poll is still open. Looks like Fishing Planet seems
[79.96s -> 86.76s]  to have crawled over with 42% of the vote. Well, it's okay because like all these kinds of games,
[86.76s -> 92.52s]  I'm either going to think this is really cool and play it for six hours or I'm going to immediately,
[92.52s -> 101.53s]  within 20 minutes, change to something else. We'll find out. What's the link? Here. Anyways,
[101.53s -> 115.80s]  how you guys doing? Here's the poll. I've already got it open. Like the election's over.
[118.71s -> 121.51s]  You know, I'm not going to get like sworn in and all of a sudden it's just like,
[121.51s -> 136.98s]  wait a minute, but what about Jupiter? You want to recount? Here it is. Millions of votes cast
[136.98s -> 142.23s]  for Fishing Planet. Actually, what really happened... I'm going to give you guys a breakdown
[142.23s -> 148.63s]  of exactly what happened here. I sometimes... Well, not sometimes. Every time. Because when
[148.63s -> 154.23s]  I'm setting up a stream, I come in and I'm doing scenes on OBS. I'm making sure the game is captured
[154.23s -> 159.11s]  correctly. I usually sit here for about 30, 40 minutes before a stream. I'll go eat. I'll come
[159.11s -> 164.47s]  back. I'll go to the bathroom. Whatever. The first message that I saw when I sat down into the pre-stream
[164.47s -> 171.35s]  chat was, wake me when he starts playing Fishing Planet. And I said, okay, wake up. Like I'm going
[171.35s -> 185.19s]  to do it. I won guide the one guy. And I thought that was funny. And then I put it on the poll
[187.11s -> 201.90s]  and people voted for it. One guy. Wake up. It doesn't matter. It's already open.
[203.14s -> 207.38s]  Hey, he didn't even know. This is... It's this person's birthday today.
[207.38s -> 213.19s]  You didn't know that. It's happy birthday to this person. Here's your birthday present.
[214.31s -> 227.90s]  It's already open. Thank you. There he is. It's a special birthday present.
[231.94s -> 237.62s]  Anyways, Maximum Action is the other game that I have. So whether that's today, if that, you know...
[238.50s -> 246.98s]  No, I'm not sure. Quit. Maximum Action is the other game. So if I played this for like all day,
[246.98s -> 253.94s]  then whatever. We'll play it tomorrow. Right? This is Fishing Planet. This is going to be a relaxing
[253.94s -> 264.76s]  day. Hit enter. No. Approach the shoreline. I was ready for this. Make your first cast. Aim at the
[264.76s -> 270.68s]  ring. Click... By the way, this is an MMO. People didn't know that one before they came in.
[270.68s -> 275.16s]  Talking shit. All right. So just... What do you mean aim in the circle? Aim at the ring.
[275.72s -> 287.51s]  Okay. And that was not really a cast. I kind of just dropped it in there. Hold left mouse button.
[291.72s -> 300.36s]  Oh, I have to hold it. Okay. What am I doing wrong?
[308.98s -> 312.42s]  It's funny because this is the kind of shit that I would do if I went fishing. I never go fishing,
[312.42s -> 321.03s]  but I don't know what to do. I always found fishing to be just like a strange thing. You
[321.03s -> 326.71s]  throw this little wire into the ocean or into a lake and you hope that somebody walks by and bites
[326.71s -> 337.50s]  it? I don't think I could... No. I'll tell you, I think fishing is going to go away with the iPad
[337.50s -> 345.22s]  generation. Because within five minutes an ad didn't pop up for me to click on, like warning
[345.22s -> 348.66s]  me about the weather in my area. You think Zoomers are going to be able to handle this?
[349.22s -> 380.87s]  Playing their like iPad game? Oh, yeah. Right. F11. Right. Okay. I gotta wait for fish to bite.
[380.87s -> 386.68s]  This is what we're doing. I got bread on there. What kind of bread? Bread. I don't see. I don't
[386.68s -> 400.52s]  see bread. Click right mouse. All right. Watch that line tension. How do I... What do I do? Real?
[403.02s -> 415.00s]  There's no more instructions. Go get them? How do I reel? I'm holding down left mouse button.
[415.93s -> 420.82s]  What's reel? What if I just walk backwards?
[427.90s -> 440.92s]  Pick it up. It's right there. Just pick it up. I swear to God. I'm like slingshotting him around.
[440.92s -> 463.70s]  I just want to pick him up. What am I doing? I can't reel him in. Is he still on it? How do
[463.70s -> 481.05s]  you reel this in? I think I'm stuck on a tree. I'm tying myself up. Imagine walking by this poor
[481.05s -> 486.41s]  sucker. He's like... It's like a dog leash. Like I went to the dog park. Oh, no, no. You're just
[486.41s -> 491.21s]  going to me. I'll go under you and... It's like seeing another person with a dog. Except it's just
[491.21s -> 501.18s]  me. Try to reel it in. I don't know how to fucking do this. No, no, no, no, no, no. Not yet. Reeling
[501.18s -> 515.53s]  speed. Turn move rod. Where... Reeling speed. Where's reel it in? Hold right click. That just
[515.53s -> 524.52s]  holds it in the air. The fish is still on that. No, he's going back in. No, I can't... He's... I
[524.52s -> 540.92s]  can't let him back in the water. He's gonna make it. Are you fucking serious? There's like bugs on
[540.92s -> 566.06s]  me. Get over... I can't, dude. I'm fucking... I think I'm done. I can't reel it in. Right and left click.
[568.60s -> 572.84s]  All right. Do I need to turn the webcam on to prove to you guys that I'm pressing left click?
[576.12s -> 583.75s]  Pitch cast reel on. Pull strike aimed cast. Reeling speed. Turn move rod. It's a bug. Snap
[583.75s -> 590.26s]  the line. Line break is B. All right. Well, let me bring him over here. Can I like pick him up?
[590.82s -> 606.30s]  Where is he from here? Where is he from here? Come on. Just break the line. Line break. B.
[607.10s -> 626.68s]  B. I think I have to restart the game. B. Line break is B, right? Maybe like one, two?
[627.56s -> 637.85s]  How do I get the line to snap? Hold right mouse button. Yes. And then hold left click. I just...
[637.85s -> 655.35s]  I don't have like a dummy mouse that I'm pressing. I am doing the... I don't have two... Listen.
[659.78s -> 699.62s]  What the fuck? I... Let's try it again. Is it capturing? Can you see it? Harder than actual...
[699.62s -> 711.21s]  No, I ran into a bug. Okay. Now I thought I had music for a second. Approach the shoreline.
[711.85s -> 720.86s]  Shoreline approached. Make your first cast. Aim at the ring. Click left mouse button. Got it. Okay.
[722.14s -> 742.74s]  Wait for fish to bite. This might take a while. Is that one right there? Click right mouse button.
[742.74s -> 750.02s]  Got it. Reeling to... Hold left... This wasn't happening before. I swear to God that wasn't
[750.02s -> 761.03s]  happening before. I told you. It took so fucking long. All right. Got 4 XP to this confetti coming
[761.03s -> 769.24s]  down. All right. Make a few casts and catch some fish. All right. Now I'm excited. Now I'm into
[769.24s -> 787.42s]  this. Why is this an MMO? I have no idea. How can I tell when there's a bite? Is it just bob?
[788.31s -> 805.22s]  That's what that means, right? All right. Is it too shallow? You can't... I can't walk around,
[805.22s -> 824.76s]  right? That scares the fish. You have to stand completely still. You can't talk either. You can't
[824.76s -> 843.48s]  like move your mouth. See? Told you. That wasn't somebody on the line? I'm gonna go over here.
[845.13s -> 859.72s]  Too early? How is that too early? Your... Your viewer count is dropping. Quick. Do a face cam.
[859.72s -> 867.19s]  Oh, the viewer count is fucking rising. 7.4 inches. Release it. All right. Let's get another one.
[867.19s -> 890.65s]  Too early. Too early. Too early. Wait. Wait. Wait. Was there one on there? Right there?
[891.37s -> 903.27s]  Ooh. That's a big one. 8.6. Time for a real catch. Ooh. Open inventory and change your bait for a
[903.27s -> 916.90s]  bigger fish. Uh, drag and drop to set red worms as bait. Crappy bluegill pumpkin seed. All right.
[918.10s -> 921.62s]  We're putting worms on here now. Now let's go to the local shop and get a fish keeper.
[923.32s -> 933.82s]  Choose tools and equipment. Buy a fish keep net to keep your catch. How much is 150 bucks?
[934.62s -> 940.47s]  Seems like a lot. We're all set here. Open the lake map. For bigger fish, prefer a good hiding
[940.47s -> 948.23s]  place. So let's select a different fishing spot. All right. What is this? Homes is my house. I have
[948.23s -> 969.34s]  a basic business license. Okay. I'm ready. This is an actual iPad game. I know. All right. Here we go.
[973.75s -> 984.68s]  Float is on the side because the bait hit the bottom. Reel the bait back in. How far? Decreased
[984.68s -> 1004.66s]  the line leader to 19. Use the zero button. What? Oh, line leader change to 19. All right. So I
[1004.66s -> 1009.46s]  have no idea what that means. That's like fish talk. I don't know what it means. That means how
[1009.46s -> 1042.95s]  much line I give. Is that too early? I think it was too early. Pop one. What is it? Oh, it's a big
[1042.95s -> 1053.48s]  mouth bash. It's a crappy. Should I keep it? It's 13 inches. Keep. Level up. I've got 1500 bucks. I
[1053.48s -> 1060.44s]  got a new pond. I got a dart, a net, and two. You guys are gonna have to help me out here with this
[1060.44s -> 1069.40s]  shit. Callisto. That's a head. Hook six crimson cold water golden. I don't know what any of these mean.
[1071.26s -> 1079.66s]  Open the lake map to continue your adventure. You know what I need to have happen? I have to get
[1080.70s -> 1086.74s]  I don't know. I'm gonna have to hook it up to a button on here. I think I want a song to play
[1086.74s -> 1091.50s]  when I catch a fish like while it's on the reel. Okay. You can leave the lake now and go
[1092.22s -> 1105.82s]  home like a real winner. Okay. Result in rewards. So where are the other players? Challenge
[1105.82s -> 1109.90s]  complete. Complete the tutorial. All right. So where are we going? Where are we dropping?
[1109.90s -> 1116.65s]  Huh? What do you guys think? That's this. How many people are here? There's four people here.
[1116.65s -> 1129.69s]  These servers are the I don't know how this is supposed to be. Hold on. Did I actually just say
[1129.69s -> 1135.45s]  where are we dropping? And it automatically is a bad Fortnite joke when I actually just was asking
[1135.45s -> 1151.98s]  where are we going? All right. Um let's go to the lone star lake mud water river. How much is this
[1151.98s -> 1169.27s]  to unlock? For six coins. How many? I only have two coins. Where should I go? Go to Alaska? I need
[1169.27s -> 1181.62s]  $10,000 to go here. I don't have that kind of money. Don't have any missions. These numbers are
[1181.62s -> 1194.38s]  levels. Oh. So what? Just go back to my lake? It's been like 10 days since my prime sum ended and I
[1194.38s -> 1201.94s]  keep forgetting to resub. I'm sorry. Why did I read that? Don't you don't have to be sorry
[1201.94s -> 1206.82s]  that you didn't resub. All right. What about this one? How much is to go here? Oh okay. We're going
[1206.82s -> 1214.50s]  to uh we're going to France or wherever this is. France? Yeah. Let's go. We're going to the check.

[1526.55s -> 1551.11s]  and like grabbing somebody by like the fucking cheek. Easy. I think I'm stuck. All right.

[1710.47s -> 1721.05s]  Is it possible? I can't use boats here. Well can I borrow your license? I know that's not how it
[1721.05s -> 1747.18s]  works but can I just borrow your license and go on your boat? That's a crime. It is a video game
[1747.18s -> 1754.34s]  though. This is a video game. There is no like add to friends, add to your business license.
[1754.90s -> 1768.98s]  I've got news for you guys. This is a fishing video game. You'll be lucky to catch one fish

[2143.74s -> 2151.74s]  out? Break the line. Are you sure you want to break the line? Yeah. Did I just break the line and
[2151.74s -> 2160.78s]  hold on. Did I break my rod in half? Why would I do that? Oh it looks like my fishing line's broken.
[2160.78s -> 2180.54s]  May as well snap this thing over my knee. No I did not. Inventory. There's the okay I got line here.
[2181.10s -> 2188.79s]  Adjust the line length by like 140. There we go. Okay what's this? This is still on here. Where's
[2188.79s -> 2204.74s]  my rod? Hook. Okay I got a hook on there. Red worms. All right I'm ready to go. How do I equip
[2204.74s -> 2228.68s]  a fishing rod? It's tough. That was a weak throw. It was fine. Let me reel it in a little video.
[2235.00s -> 2247.70s]  Excuse me. What if we all touch? This is probably giving actual people that fish in here anxiety.
[2247.70s -> 2273.98s]  I need a better f11. What did I just do? Holy fuck. Why is my instinct to turn and hit the
[2273.98s -> 2281.83s]  person next to me in the head with the rod? I don't know. All right let me get that again.
[2285.48s -> 2299.99s]  Nice. That was not even further than just tossing it out there. Catch some grasshoppers with your
[2299.99s -> 2308.41s]  hands. Oh what's that? All right come on now. Come on reel it in. Forget this. I want to see
[2308.41s -> 2325.00s]  what you get. You have like a shark on there. Easy now. Easy. Easy. What is it? Oh what? That's
[2325.00s -> 2344.98s]  insane. All right Jeremy this ain't mini golf. Like let's go. Why am I only going that far? Zero
[2344.98s -> 2354.76s]  feet? Wait I saw. I know those are raindrops. Never mind. In every fishing game when you see
[2354.76s -> 2357.96s]  the little doop doop doop that means a fish is in like a fishing company's over there.
[2358.84s -> 2379.02s]  All right I'm just gonna leave it in. I'm not gonna move. I don't even like beer especially bud red
[2379.82s -> 2384.36s]  but I want to just drink a bud red right now. It's the only time you'll ever hurt. I will never say
[2384.36s -> 2416.78s]  that out loud ever again except for right now this only instance. I want one of those but regular
[2416.78s -> 2441.75s]  Budweiser. Did I get it? Okay I actually did it. I ripped it out of the water. Guys guys come look.
[2443.61s -> 2450.10s]  Show and hide. Let me examine. Look. Look. Look. Look. Look. Look what I got. Look what I got. Look
[2450.10s -> 2460.86s]  what I got. Look what I got. Look at this. Look at mine. Look at my fish. All right release. Level
[2460.86s -> 2470.71s]  up. Cheese. Camo fest. I want the cheese. Can I? I just want to eat that cheese. I don't even want
[2470.71s -> 2484.62s]  to put it on the lure. Sinker. Barley. Chainsaw. What else is in here? I unlocked. I pretty much
[2484.62s -> 2519.59s]  unlocked the whole game. Go to the settings and enable big bobber. Big bobber. Big bobber. Oh I
[2519.59s -> 2588.10s]  see what you mean. Now you can actually see what you're doing. Mod me. Give yourself an atomic
[2588.10s -> 2611.82s]  wedgie. Why do I feel like they did that on jackass at some point? I know I just said hurry up in a
[2611.82s -> 2641.67s]  fishing game. Come on. Anything. What is that? Why is that a swear? You can buy the semolina
[2642.63s -> 2681.59s]  excuse you. What are you saying? Can you can you not write? Got one. I'll keep this one. You can't
[2681.59s -> 2694.89s]  write like ball. I need more line. I need I want to buy some cheese. Where are the big fish? Can you
[2694.89s -> 2702.90s]  catch like huge things in this game? Where do we find the big ones? Throw at green not yellow.
[2703.54s -> 2719.54s]  Throw at green. What do you mean? Go to the ocean. Go in that house. Can we go in the biggest fish
[2719.62s -> 2722.82s]  there is? Biggest fish here is a carp and they get to like two pounds.
[2724.63s -> 2732.31s]  That sucks. I want to do like the I want to catch like the tuna. Those things are 13 pounds.
[2734.14s -> 2782.22s]  Add a zero and another zero. Rude. Thanks. I think my fair part of both is wait a minute. That's a
[2782.22s -> 2790.14s]  splash. It's only one pound. That's actually pretty good. All right. This ain't gonna I get a cast
[2790.14s -> 2798.31s]  again. I need more line. I need more line. Give me some more line. Missions. Loan start to come
[2798.31s -> 2805.50s]  true. Loan start floor start to catch the listed fish in this lake. I'm in another country right
[2805.50s -> 2811.61s]  now so you're gonna have to wait a minute. I need the spin master. That's what I want. Where's the
[2811.61s -> 2824.39s]  cheese? Bait. Cheese. Okay how much money do I have? I want a lot of cheese. I don't I'm it's
[2824.39s -> 2833.00s]  weird that oh there it is. I can't buy it. Why? I need to be like level 11 for a barley. We'll get
[2833.00s -> 2841.05s]  some of this. All right here we go. Looking for a bluegill. What have I got? I want a bluegill.
[2842.86s -> 2861.50s]  Now we also need a slingshot. What? Why do I need that? Lures. What's a good one? Gold. I'll take
[2861.50s -> 2877.75s]  the gold one. Ground baits? Hold on. These just bags of chips? All right I need reels. Okay this
[2877.75s -> 2887.00s]  is where it gets good. I can buy a mini spin 1200. Weight. Recovery. Look at this thing right here.
[2887.64s -> 2897.13s]  Check. A mini spin 1200 right? That's a better version of this. I don't even know what any of
[2897.13s -> 2906.65s]  this means but I'm just gonna get it. Why can I not equip it? Okay lions. I want some good shit.
[2907.90s -> 2916.54s]  Mono. Why is this more expensive? XXL. Length 300 yards. All right we'll get some.
[2919.43s -> 2929.72s]  500 yards. Okay. Mono leader. Floor row. No no that's in-game currency.
[2932.54s -> 2939.77s]  I'm just gonna get them. I don't know if they really do. Tackle. Hooks. Hook six. I have hook
[2939.77s -> 2950.28s]  eight. Oval. I need a good one. Chubby. Floating weight high. Shape chubby. Make it easy to see
[2950.28s -> 2957.42s]  at long distances. Anything from hand fish to salmon to steelhead. I guess it's just
[2957.42s -> 2964.78s]  aesthetically pleasing to get the chubby one. All right let's go. I already own this. All right
[2964.78s -> 2978.70s]  six. Hook six. Line. Mono 005. We'll take it at 139 feet I guess. Cheese. Looking for a bluegill.
[2979.42s -> 2990.26s]  What kind of hook do I got on there? All right where do I get a bluegill? Map. None of these
[2990.26s -> 3002.36s]  bluegills. There's a goldfish too. All right not this way. No no no no no. Back up. What about
[3002.36s -> 3011.37s]  over here? Oh look at this. Carp. Roach. Perch. No I need a bluegill. Where can I get a bluegill?
[3012.01s -> 3031.38s]  What's my level three? They eat cheese? Who eats cheese here? Me and the common carp have the same
[3031.38s -> 3051.77s]  diet. Like in order of how often you consume them. Nobody wants cheese here. Cheese. Okay I'm
[3051.77s -> 3061.88s]  leaving. I'm going home. Nobody here wants cheese. I have to leave. All right we're out. I'm gonna get
[3061.88s -> 3076.33s]  I'm gonna do one more attempt here. What's this one? No. Let's get one more fish. All right what
[3076.33s -> 3087.21s]  have I got for? I got cheese on here. Who? Anybody wants cheese? What's my favorite cheese? It really
[3087.21s -> 3094.31s]  depends on the scenario because there's a lot of different answers to that question. Swiss cheese
[3094.31s -> 3102.74s]  is the best on sandwiches. I think without a doubt. Asiago cheese is really good on pretty
[3102.74s -> 3106.02s]  much everything no matter what it is. Especially when it's baked onto something else into a crust.
[3108.49s -> 3112.41s]  I don't like brie. It reminds me throw up. It smells and tastes like puke. I don't like it.
[3115.62s -> 3125.05s]  Aguda. Blue cheese are both very good. And I don't trust any cheese where you can eat the rind.
[3125.93s -> 3132.18s]  Oh the brie. Have some brie. I don't want to eat the lemon rind. That shit's pretty much made out
[3132.18s -> 3160.10s]  of plastic. I don't want to eat it. Bavardi is good. Yeah. Do a cheese tier list. Of course that
[3160.10s -> 3168.17s]  exists. Do I like monster? I only like monster cheese when it's on a plate sliced into small
[3168.17s -> 3177.80s]  squares and there's a cracker right next to it. I don't eat it anywhere else. Blue cheese I would
[3177.80s -> 3184.28s]  I it's my favorite on anything. I would put blue cheese on anything and I'm not talking about blue
[3184.28s -> 3189.48s]  cheese crumble. I'm talking about the blue cheese sauce. Not blue cheese dressing. Get it right.
[3190.89s -> 3198.36s]  Oh blue cheese dressing. No no no no no. Blue cheese sauce. The thicker blue cheese. See people
[3198.36s -> 3201.80s]  always confuse this and when you sometimes when you go to a restaurant you get blue cheese. Oh
[3201.80s -> 3206.20s]  you want blue cheese. Yeah I'll take a side of blue cheese. Yeah I'll take blue cheese on that.
[3206.20s -> 3225.06s]  It's the blue cheese dressing that you put on a salad. No get that away from me. What is blue
[3225.06s -> 3231.22s]  cheese sauce? It's thicker as it has a thicker base. It can be dunked into with like chicken
[3231.22s -> 3240.92s]  fingers especially buffalo chicken. Buffalo chicken tenders and that blue cheese thick
[3240.92s -> 3248.82s]  sauce. The thick dunkable blue cheese. Find me a better appetizer and I'll fucking say all right.
[3253.94s -> 3259.14s]  The biggest offense of any restaurant. I don't care who they are. I don't care what they specialize
[3259.14s -> 3264.74s]  in. I don't care what their star rating is. If you order blue cheese with a meal and they give you
[3264.74s -> 3278.54s]  a packet of blue cheese dressing on the side, do not ever go there again. I think my line's too
[3278.54s -> 3305.37s]  long. There we go. This woman. Do you see this swarm? It's mold. Yeah and guys please. You're
[3305.37s -> 3313.34s]  eating mold. Do you know. Did you know that you eat over 12 inches of dirt every single meal? Did
[3313.34s -> 3324.65s]  you guys know that? Every single meal you eat over 12 at least 12 inches of dirt. Something I
[3324.65s -> 3332.73s]  I've been talking at least that much. Do I have a source on that? Yeah because you're eating about
[3332.73s -> 3357.59s]  12 inches at least off the ground. I got another one for you. Turn my mic back on. Why don't we
[3357.59s -> 3377.74s]  eat cheese here? Did you know you drank over 12 liters of monster energy a month? Um no don't do
[3377.74s -> 3397.45s]  that. That's like that's like an easy way to get a heart attack. Don't do that. Do a cheese tasting
[3397.45s -> 3404.62s]  stream. I'd like to do a catch a fish on game stream if I could do that. Here we go. Here we go.
[3404.62s -> 3426.41s]  Here we go. Here we go. Come on. Got it. What is it? Oh it's a common roach. Release. How about uh
[3427.05s -> 3434.30s]  this game's actually like kind of fun. I'm not gonna. I saw at least 150 comments of people
[3434.30s -> 3439.50s]  saying why don't you play one of the good fishing games. This is this is all right. This is like a
[3439.50s -> 3464.18s]  not a bad one. The line's a little too long. Ban that guy for three days. No cheese. Cheese is good
[3464.18s -> 3476.02s]  but you can't eat cheese too often. It just turns into cement in your body. Got it. European
[3476.02s -> 3501.46s]  perch. No. I want like a at least half pond. Can we go ice fishing in this game? You can?
[3502.18s -> 3521.78s]  That's actually kind of cool. Has anyone ever tried to make a fantasy fishing game?
[3523.21s -> 3530.71s]  No. People make a fantasy game and then put fishing in usually. We got a little bit of a bite there.
[3533.13s -> 3539.80s]  Unlock mud water river as soon as possible. Okay. There's big catfish there. Do they like cheese?
[3542.95s -> 3546.23s]  I'll tell you. You know what I do love? A restaurant that has a good. I'm gonna say
[3546.23s -> 3549.83s]  this wrong because I don't know the names of things. I just know what it is. I just know
[3549.83s -> 3554.87s]  when it comes in front of me. I just know what it is. Uh I'm gonna say it. I don't know.
[3554.87s -> 3573.78s]  I just point at it and I go oh I want that. I don't I know what it is. It's the board with
[3573.78s -> 3579.62s]  the the figs and the cheeses and the the prosciutto and the ham and the salami and the olives.
[3579.62s -> 3585.24s]  I love those things and when a restaurant does one of those good they oh that's all you need.
[3585.24s -> 3594.47s]  Just order one of those and just eat it. Uh chikurri board. Chikurri board. There it is.
[3603.64s -> 3608.04s]  Just eat raw meat off the plate. What do you mean raw meat? Prosciutto's not raw. Is prosciutto
[3608.04s -> 3623.16s]  raw meat? No it's not. Raw meat? Yeah it's cured. It's cured. It's not. They don't just like do an
[3623.16s -> 3640.71s]  ice cream scoop of like 80 20 grocery store ground beef. It's cured meat. Cured is raw.
[3640.71s -> 3648.90s]  No it's been cooked because it's been cured. It's it's salted to a point where it cooks it.
[3649.62s -> 3652.74s]  I don't know what that means. I told you. I just point to stuff at the menu.
[3667.66s -> 3676.10s]  I had it right. I asked it's salted to a point where bacteria can't. I know. I know and I said
[3676.10s -> 3681.86s]  it right but people go to question mark. They go like this. What does this guy just say?
[3683.54s -> 3698.46s]  It's salted to a point where it's been. Why am I not getting any bites?
[3706.73s -> 3713.06s]  Yeah I know curing meat doesn't cook the meat but I know. I'm just I'm listen to me. I'll take a
[3713.06s -> 3735.05s]  chikurri board please with extra figs because they're delicious. You sound like an annoying me
[3735.05s -> 3750.04s]  with that voice. Which one? An annoying me? Me's don't talk. Do me's talk? I've never heard a me
[3750.04s -> 3760.04s]  talk before. The only closest thing I can think of is just when you hit okay on the menu with a me.
[3760.04s -> 3772.30s]  It just goes like they don't have a voice. Fortnite okay. Fortnite Jimmy just like screwed
[3772.30s -> 3794.04s]  up that whole thing. I was seriously about to catch a fish right there. Watch it. Watch it.
[3794.76s -> 3797.72s]  What do you got? Let's see it. What do you got going here? I want to see. What do you got going
[3797.72s -> 3808.66s]  on here? You got something don't you? What is it? That's a that's pretty big. For a second I
[3808.66s -> 3820.31s]  thought that one pound almost a pound and a half. Nice. Kick that person so I can get in. I didn't
[3820.31s -> 3836.34s]  think there was that much demand for a fishing planet. Apparently there is. There's not. Here we
[3836.34s -> 3856.90s]  are. I would have had something here too. Uh-oh. Fortnite Jimmy 2010. Starting to show signs of
[3856.90s -> 3879.91s]  agitation. All caps. Come on something. I teach elementary all my kids love Fortnite.
[3881.66s -> 3889.21s]  Yeah it's Fortnite. You know whatever. I'm trying to think of the games that I liked
[3890.62s -> 3895.27s]  when I was younger. It's hard to compare though because we're in a different world.
[3896.07s -> 3900.95s]  We're in like a constant completely connected and somebody the same person has walked by my
[3900.95s -> 3913.00s]  screen like 10 times. Am I going crazy? That was the same person right? Okay I'm just like I want
[3913.00s -> 3925.62s]  to know if I was freaking out or not. Yeah games have changed. We're constantly connected. Diablo
[3925.62s -> 3934.18s]  2 is probably that game for me. You can play that game online but it got to a point. You want to
[3934.18s -> 3940.78s]  know when Diablo 2 was ruined completely forever? When you would join a game and no matter what,
[3941.66s -> 3951.06s]  every 25 seconds a bot would enter the room and spam a buy items website. It happened thousands
[3951.06s -> 3955.14s]  of times if you joined a public server. That was the day when that started happening that
[3955.14s -> 3969.83s]  the game was over. They would come in. Oh here it was. And they'd have a name like this. Like and
[3970.39s -> 3977.27s]  okay here we go. And you'd get that and then they would get they would get like booted from the game.
[3977.27s -> 3990.30s]  They would just spam. It would be like you'd get that message sound in Diablo 2. They walked by
[3990.30s -> 4002.22s]  again. So you had to make private rooms. At that point it was hard to play the game online
[4002.22s -> 4012.30s]  unless you had specific people that could join a room with a password. Hold on. Finally. Finally
[4012.30s -> 4023.43s]  it's been so long. I just caught it. Almost seven tenths of a pound. Whatever that denomination
[4023.43s -> 4035.10s]  is. Almost a pound. Seven almosts of a pound. Pretty good. Keeping that one. Chunky baloney
[4035.10s -> 4041.98s]  thanks for the 10 community subs. Thank you Chunky. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's a lot.
[4043.96s -> 4047.08s]  The last two days people have just been coming in with these huge community subs
[4048.68s -> 4053.40s]  and huge amounts of money. I see one right there. Thank you guys for real.
[4055.03s -> 4058.79s]  This is an outrage. Play the next game. We're just hanging out and talking.
[4059.51s -> 4063.74s]  I'm trying to give you guys the real fishing experience because what happens is when you
[4063.74s -> 4067.10s]  go fishing. I've been fishing a few times. Is let's say you go three or four people.
[4068.70s -> 4072.62s]  Two or three of those people want to just sit silently and just hang out.
[4072.62s -> 4077.74s]  While the other fourth person, which is me, does not stop talking and annoys everybody there.
[4078.38s -> 4080.94s]  Always bringing up new topics. Always bringing up things to discuss.
[4081.74s -> 4089.10s]  And I'm the fourth annoying guy. And then the other three in a private chat text on their phones
[4089.10s -> 4094.31s]  are talking about how we're not going to bring Jeremy next time. Like hey you want to go fishing
[4094.31s -> 4100.74s]  again? Yeah just like us. And they don't have to say anything. They don't say a word. They just
[4100.74s -> 4107.93s]  make the group chat without my number in it. That's it. That's their way of doing that. They don't go
[4107.93s -> 4114.28s]  oh that was annoying. No no no. They just make that group chat without me. And I'm like hey guys
[4114.28s -> 4120.12s]  you want to go fishing? Let's go fishing again. Yeah yeah no maybe. And then yeah maybe.
[4121.85s -> 4124.97s]  Weirdly now they say a certain line every time. They're like oh yeah we'll look into that. I'll
[4124.97s -> 4144.33s]  look into that. I'm like oh look into that okay. Oh that's the biggest one yet. I got 44 dollars
[4144.33s -> 4156.49s]  for this one. Let's show this one off. This one's got this one's like thick here. Let's show it.
[4157.21s -> 4168.01s]  This is my keep net. All right I got a nine inch Russian carp. This one. I mean get rid of this one.
[4168.01s -> 4173.88s]  Can I sell them? Or does does releasing sell them? Or do I have to sell them in like a shop?
[4174.68s -> 4184.18s]  Because that one's not good enough. Keep this one. Buy a casting rod? Well I gotta get money first.
[4185.06s -> 4200.89s]  But not fishing is. Okay that screwed that up. After you start the next day you'll sell them.
[4200.89s -> 4213.21s]  All right what time is it? 7 44 a.m. This is going to take a very long time. I can't believe I'm
[4213.21s -> 4216.89s]  spending my Tuesday afternoon playing a virtual fishing game with some old boomer.
[4218.39s -> 4231.22s]  Well believe it. Um I'm sorry let me I'm gonna level with me here. Tuesday afternoon it's just
[4231.22s -> 4235.86s]  like kind of right almost in the middle of the week. Weekday like that's not a problem. What's
[4235.86s -> 4242.34s]  wrong with that? You know it's like five o'clock pacific just hanging out. There's nothing wrong
[4242.34s -> 4246.58s]  with that. This is when you go fishing. You go fishing on like Tuesday afternoon at like
[4246.58s -> 4274.28s]  four in the morning or like four or five o'clock at night. This is the time to do this. Hey guys
[4274.28s -> 4278.20s]  let's not bring Jeremy to the next fishing trip. He just won't fucking stop talking.
[4284.76s -> 4290.92s]  You got me. So what happens if you end the day early? Do I have enough money to end a day early?
[4290.92s -> 4294.52s]  Should I just go somewhere else? I need to find a fish that's at least worth selling that's worth
[4294.52s -> 4318.17s]  some money. Come on right here. You know sometimes you look over the chat. You look at you know
[4318.17s -> 4322.25s]  something that somebody in a community will and will say something along the lines of
[4323.58s -> 4331.24s]  Wow I like this stream a lot. I'd watch him paint a fence. You're being tested right now.
[4331.24s -> 4350.12s]  This is where I cut to a live camera of me with like a painter's outfit on and I got like a bucket
[4350.12s -> 4383.34s]  of paint in my hand with a fence behind me. Now that would have been funny. Damn. Damn. He streams
[4383.34s -> 4391.14s]  twice every other week and decides to play this. You're not keeping up. That's not fair. That's
[4391.38s -> 4407.06s]  inaccurate. Inaccurate. It's an inaccurate statement. Do I actually do I know how to fish?
[4408.02s -> 4437.00s]  I don't think you can know how to fish. I think it just happens. That means he doesn't.
[4457.54s -> 4471.80s]  You guys are fucking funny. Streams. Streams twice every other week. That's bullshit. Oh this one
[4471.80s -> 4486.15s]  sucks. If you go to a twitch stats website actually this is real data. I actually stream about
[4487.80s -> 4501.32s]  15 to 16 times a month. Probably like 17. 15 to 17 times a month is my accurate stats on twitch.
[4501.32s -> 4506.28s]  That means that means statistically there's a stream every other day. Statistically speaking.
[4506.92s -> 4512.89s]  Three days in a row. Two days off. Two days in a row. Three days off. Three days in a row. Three
[4512.89s -> 4525.46s]  days off. That's kind of how it happens. Every other week. No that's not that's that would mean
[4525.46s -> 4530.74s]  that I would stream seven days in a row. All right you know what they're correct. You're right.
[4530.74s -> 4537.06s]  You are correct. That is accurate. That means week one I don't stream for seven straight days.
[4537.06s -> 4545.37s]  Week two I stream seven days in a row. Week three zero. Seven days straight of no streams. Week
[4545.37s -> 4567.62s]  four seven straight days of stream. That's inaccurate though. That's misleading. My brother
[4567.62s -> 4574.92s]  typed that. Every day for a year and then don't stream for a year. Yeah I'm an every other year
[4574.92s -> 4626.49s]  streamer. You know I love board chat. It's kind of it's one of my favorite chats. Wiggle the poll.
[4627.29s -> 4634.79s]  That doesn't do anything. Board chat board chat does get bad real fast you're right.
[4634.79s -> 4661.74s]  Just wait till I go get a catfish and everybody pug champs and you forget. Still waiting for your
[4661.74s -> 4673.56s]  opinion on French cuisine. Why would I do this when I can fish in real life. I'm not sure if
[4673.56s -> 4700.70s]  you know this but I live in the desert. This is all I can do. Fish for sand worms. Go fish in the
[4700.70s -> 4710.41s]  Hoover Dam. You guys were giving me shit earlier about me not having a business license to go to
[4710.41s -> 4725.70s]  Czech Republic to get a fish and now you're telling me to go fish in the Hoover Dam. Go fishing.
[4725.70s -> 4731.70s]  I wasn't even paying attention. That's what happens. Everybody falls asleep. I wonder how
[4731.70s -> 4738.26s]  many opportunities are missed to fish because three or four people go to bed in lounge chairs
[4738.26s -> 4762.09s]  and all their fishing poles are like shaking around and they don't even do it. Oh let me up.
[4762.09s -> 4776.36s]  Let me help this guy out. Holy shit. Wow. Great minds think alike. See now that person's gonna
[4776.36s -> 4802.47s]  think that's real. There's a lot of smiley faces here. There's this smiley faces here. There's like
[4802.79s -> 4856.70s]  I gotta correct this. There's too many. There's like happy smiling faces. What's wrong with that?
[4856.70s -> 4864.17s]  The drake sword sucks. The drake sword is the best early game weapon you can possibly use in that
[4864.17s -> 4871.88s]  game. Just get it and use it without even upgrading it for like fucking 12 hours. The drake sword is
[4871.88s -> 4877.82s]  for idiots. We're not talking about like intelligence levels. We're talking about like how to make the
[4877.82s -> 4902.57s]  game easier for you. I lost my one opportunity. This guy probably likes TF2 more than the classic
[4902.57s -> 4918.76s]  game Overwatch. Yeah I do. Whatever. I want to get on a boat. All right. How much money do I have?
[4919.64s -> 4925.30s]  There's not a fish on the line right now. If there is I'm gonna laugh my ass off. Nice. I got lied
[4925.30s -> 4948.01s]  to and I could have probably sat there. And I'm going over here. Get a jet ski. Get a jet ski and
[4948.01s -> 4963.03s]  drive like really fast and turn, pull, brake and like spray everybody. Get to level four for the
[4963.03s -> 4972.86s]  next area. Am I there now? Level two? What level am I? I have to type to know. Level three.
[4983.32s -> 4997.38s]  Give me something. Can you wake me up in 30 minutes? Yes. Lewis Cheese. In 30 minutes I'm
[4997.38s -> 5007.24s]  gonna fucking call out your name. Exactly 30 minutes from right now. That'd be one hour and
[5007.24s -> 5023.78s]  54 minutes stream time. Gonna forget? No I won't. Yes you will. I will not forget that. What's his
[5023.78s -> 5048.07s]  name? Lewis Cheese. Didn't forget. Go to bed. See you in 30 minutes. Is there even bait on this?
[5048.87s -> 5055.62s]  I have french toast sticks in the oven. Wake me up in five minutes so I can flip them over. Don't
[5055.62s -> 5074.47s]  turn the oven on and go to bed. What do you got? Do you mind? All right. That's something's got to
[5074.47s -> 5084.01s]  change here. This is not working out. I need a bread. I'm gonna try bread. Worms aren't working
[5084.01s -> 5092.01s]  right now. Try to get a crappie with these. Crappie. Where's my other? There it is.
[5093.29s -> 5110.47s]  Slop spoon. I can't use that here. It's time for fun boat time. Not yet. I'm going over here.
[5110.47s -> 5125.96s]  I need to get to level four so I can go to the next area. Beer powers up your fishing rod.
[5126.68s -> 5138.44s]  How does it? Wow. You gotta buy the brackets quote funny line. It's right there.
[5139.40s -> 5166.25s]  How do I wall run? All right, Jimmy. Jimmy. Drink monster. Drink bite monster. No, why would I do
[5166.25s -> 5180.50s]  that? If I drink like a monster, I just get heartburn. This, okay, I'm just going to give
[5180.50s -> 5185.38s]  you some anecdotal evidence here. Just anecdotally, whenever I drink an energy drink,
[5187.99s -> 5192.84s]  I get heartburn and my eyes hurt. I just don't, I'm not going to drink one of those.
[5193.72s -> 5215.56s]  All of them across the board pretty much do this. Too much energy from my
[5215.56s -> 5223.19s]  body. No. God, you should just, you should be eating fucking vegetables and fruits and shit.
[5223.91s -> 5241.93s]  How many times do we have to have this conversation? Eat a banana. Pretty good. Keep it.
[5246.87s -> 5260.57s]  Yes. Mud river. Mud river. Let's go. Sayonara. It's time to go to mud river. How much money did
[5260.57s -> 5270.14s]  I get? 105 bucks and not premium. Premium. Does that have to buy it or something? Sorry, Jimmy.
[5275.00s -> 5281.94s]  Day two. I didn't, let me day two. This is the first time I've ever played this game. All right.
[5281.94s -> 5289.78s]  Where's that mud river? There it is. Let me get a license for it. 1200 bucks to be here. Whatever.
[5291.19s -> 5295.91s]  Uh, advanced license. No restrictions. I don't want any violation of license
[5295.91s -> 5306.15s]  rules. There's nothing fine. One day advanced license. All right. Let's go.
[5308.63s -> 5326.94s]  One day. Let's go. Mud river. Catfish heaven. Pike challenge lost. It's not catfish heaven.
[5331.30s -> 5342.07s]  These are big. Enjoy exploring mud water river and its premises for a certain number of days.
[5342.95s -> 5361.26s]  I don't stop advertising to me. What's this? Nice. All right. What's up? So what's what if
[5361.26s -> 5370.46s]  what fishes are here? Fish species. We've got catfish. They like marshmallow, pet food, leeches,
[5370.46s -> 5376.46s]  and okay marshmallows. Dough balls. I don't have any of those. Dough balls. I gotta buy some bait
[5376.46s -> 5387.98s]  here. Blood worms. I need marshmallows. All right. Marshmallows and pet food. How much are
[5387.98s -> 5403.90s]  marshmallows? Did I unlock marshmallows yet? I can't even get marshmallows. How much is both?
[5404.54s -> 5418.90s]  But there is pet food. Okay. The buy the balls. I can't have to be level 11.
[5423.19s -> 5431.70s]  All right. So let's get the pet food on here. Do I? Okay. Do I need a certain line or something
[5431.70s -> 5454.31s]  or a certain hook for this 150 length long line short line hook six. Okay. Let's see. Let's go.
[5456.47s -> 5471.48s]  Got my line here. What is my lead? 18, 25, 30 inches. That sounds about right. No, no, no, no,
[5471.48s -> 5474.68s]  no, no, no, no. That's not right. I got pet food on there though. No, no, no. I gotta throw it.
[5475.88s -> 5501.54s]  F11. One and a half pound catfish. Nice. Nice dude. Right here. Here we go. Hey there, new to the
[5501.54s -> 5505.22s]  streams anyways. Do you think you could do a dab at some point? It's no pressure. It's just my
[5508.44s -> 5511.88s]  it's red on my screen. So I have to read them. Here we go. Here we go. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[5511.88s -> 5521.50s]  Strike it. Strike. Come on. Get on there. I know you want to get on that. You showed interest for
[5521.50s -> 5550.44s]  a second. Come on. I had it. There it is. There it is. There it is. Oh, easy. Easy. Pumpkin seed.
[5552.39s -> 5563.46s]  12 bucks. No, get out of here. I want to go to another spot. You want to how you make this game
[5563.46s -> 5566.82s]  insane and have everybody talk about it and just be like, Oh, you have to play it.
[5567.62s -> 5571.62s]  Have like a werewolf jump out of here. Jump scare the fuck out of you. And then you put like your
[5571.62s -> 5574.90s]  rod, you flip it upside down and it becomes a weapon. And it's a first person fucking like
[5574.90s -> 5597.24s]  fantasy fighting game. Entirely different game. No, just for this one spot. You know how many
[5597.24s -> 5602.79s]  Buzzfeed articles will be written on your game. You can have this fishing game being completely
[5602.79s -> 5620.06s]  normal. Everyone would just camp that spot. Yeah. Make it like a 0.2% chance to happen.
[5620.70s -> 5631.72s]  I should pee. Peeing in the river helps attract fish. I feel like that's weird enough to be true.
[5644.10s -> 5661.85s]  Interest. Interesting. It might already be in there and nobody's done it enough to trigger
[5661.85s -> 5676.07s]  the warning. It's possible. It's true. Fish smell the ammonia in urine. See the first person that
[5676.07s -> 5680.23s]  said that it was weird enough to be true. That second comment was just specific enough to be
[5680.23s -> 5715.96s]  false. Somebody bite this. Try again. This way. When am I going to close this game and stream
[5715.96s -> 5724.07s]  Just Dance 4? I'll give you a spoiler for one of the 37 Connect games that I have. You want
[5724.07s -> 5736.42s]  to get spoiled on one of them? I'll do it. I'm going to, I'm just going to show a flash on cam.
[5737.14s -> 5779.34s]  You ready? Hope you guys can catch it. How's fishing going? Pretty good. I've done nothing bad.
[5786.20s -> 5794.76s]  Somebody's on it. Come on. Somebody's looking at it. I want a catfish. Please
[5795.56s -> 5804.73s]  catch a fish. Dumbass. That's not how this works. You could be the best fishermen in the world
[5807.67s -> 5815.40s]  and they'll fish just don't want to bite today. I am solely reliant on another party to be able
[5815.40s -> 5829.30s]  to be good at this. What do you mean false? Sometimes the fishes don't want to bite today.
[5829.94s -> 5837.56s]  You could do all kinds of like little tricks like this. Like turn, turn, turn, turn, twist,
[5837.56s -> 5840.28s]  turn, turn, turn, turn, twist. Everybody has their own little thing they do. Right?
[5840.92s -> 5844.09s]  But the fish isn't hungry. They're not going to bite you. It's not going to work.
[5844.73s -> 5856.50s]  Different spot. Yeah, this spot sucks. Watch out for the fucking werewolf. You're not going to find
[5856.50s -> 5878.44s]  a catfish here. Just go on tinder. 10 out of 10 joke. I didn't make it. I was responding to it.
[5878.44s -> 5898.71s]  I was reacting. React more. There's still pet food on here. Right? Yeah. Nice and easy. Just quick.
[5899.83s -> 5906.42s]  Just to show that I'm moving around and see on the left side, left side of the screen.
[5906.42s -> 5923.72s]  Did you see that? Oh, somebody get it. Get it. It's right there. You're right here. I want you
[5923.72s -> 5939.38s]  to grab it. Just get it. Almost there. Please. Just pull it down. Got him. Now that's a big one.
[5939.38s -> 5951.82s]  13.3 inches over a pound. I wish you could walk in the water. Just walk in there and show.
[5952.84s -> 5957.50s]  That's big. All right. That one's money. We'll have some money for that.
[5957.50s -> 5965.02s]  It's too bad catfish taste like ass. I have to say, I don't think I've ever had it before.
[5965.02s -> 5985.59s]  I don't think I've ever eaten catfish. Let's just relax here. Oops. No, I don't want to open the
[5985.59s -> 5995.56s]  menu. I don't want to open the menu. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Here it comes. Here it comes.
[5995.56s -> 6007.56s]  Somebody coming. Somebody coming. Timed out. What? It didn't even move. It was just barely
[6007.56s -> 6023.58s]  bobbing a little. That's annoying. Catfish eat mostly just shit stuff, so they taste like shit.
[6027.70s -> 6047.16s]  Hold on. It's still here. Come on. What is it? That's even bigger. 1.2 pounds. Almost 13.7 inches.
[6052.90s -> 6063.75s]  Larry, keep it. Nice. Okay. This spot actually is pretty good. Let me check this spot over here.
[6064.31s -> 6075.29s]  Is there another spot besides this way? Can I go this way? Like to the left? What the fuck was that?
[6075.29s -> 6088.92s]  What the fuck? What? What the fuck? How do I take the weapon out? How do I take out the weapon?
[6090.68s -> 6116.81s]  Let's go motherfucker. I'm ready. Is it gone? So I've never had it before. Catfish is one of
[6116.81s -> 6120.41s]  those things that I feel like it's at a ton of restaurants, but not at any restaurants.
[6123.13s -> 6128.47s]  It's weird. I see it on menus and I'm like, oh, they have fucking catfish here all the time,
[6128.47s -> 6139.93s]  but then when I want to try it, it's never there. You have to cook it really carefully.
[6142.98s -> 6163.13s]  I scared your cat. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare your cat. You scared me.
[6164.49s -> 6168.89s]  But why the fuck would they put that in this game? That's not fucking cool. That's stupid.
[6170.62s -> 6174.70s]  Why would you ever put that in a game and scare the shit out of everybody that plays it?
[6174.70s -> 6180.98s]  What a bad idea. It's supposed to be a relaxing fishing game and you're gonna have like a werewolf
[6180.98s -> 6208.04s]  jump out and scream. That's kind of like, that's not a good idea. I can't wait for the next five
[6208.04s -> 6216.90s]  sound effects. That's what this is. The funny sound effect. I can't wait for the funny sound,
[6216.90s -> 6218.98s]  the next funny sound effect. Me either.
[6238.30s -> 6242.82s]  Stop. You're going to lose all your plus twos. Watch out. Watch it. It's going to happen again.
[6250.36s -> 6279.24s]  They're already gone. Market manipulation at its finest. This was a much better spot,
[6279.24s -> 6301.38s]  though. It actually was. Come on. Somebody's freaking out over there. Yeah. It's all right.
[6301.38s -> 6311.03s]  They're probably lagging. Fight it. It's right there. Talk to the guy across the river. Would
[6311.03s -> 6317.88s]  you do something like that? Are you serious? The thing bopped all the way down. If you were fishing,
[6317.88s -> 6322.36s]  if you're the only person here and that person was fishing and you were fishing and you were sitting
[6322.36s -> 6326.66s]  there for like an hour or two straight, eventually, don't you think you would be,
[6327.46s -> 6335.29s]  you'd say like, catch anything or something like that, just to lighten up the mood or something.
[6336.01s -> 6353.96s]  I feel like somebody would do that. No, not as big as the other one, but still all right.
[6357.66s -> 6363.34s]  Yeah. You wouldn't yell over there. Hey, did you see the werewolf put a boombox like in the
[6363.34s -> 6367.98s]  bush over here, hit play and run back over here. That's the equivalent of what I just did to you
[6367.98s -> 6392.42s]  guys. And then run around like I'm scared. Or someone just pick up their tackle box and just
[6392.42s -> 6416.76s]  move a hundred feet that way. What's a taco box? Tackle box. We already went over cheeses.
[6419.78s -> 6428.09s]  My favorite cheese is Swiss cheese. That's unpopular though. People don't like Swiss cheese.
[6428.09s -> 6437.10s]  They think it's just smells and is gross. Why? The same people that will eat brie and talk about how
[6437.18s -> 6447.85s]  brie is the best will be angry that I said I like Swiss. They both stink. They both have like a very
[6447.85s -> 6455.56s]  distinct flavor to them. Why? Why is your cheese better than my cheese? I think it's pretty big.
[6457.42s -> 6467.90s]  Nine and a half inches. That's a, that's a big one. Brie cheese tastes like plastic. Brie cheese.
[6467.90s -> 6498.15s]  I don't like brie. I don't, I'm not a fan at all. This one's a big one. Wow. 1.7 pounds,
[6498.15s -> 6506.68s]  14, almost 15 inches, $45 keeping it. So I have a question. I feel, I feel like I'm,
[6506.68s -> 6512.60s]  it's not hard to do this. I just hit right click and rip them out of the ocean.
[6513.16s -> 6531.82s]  It's not hard to fish germ. I don't, I don't say that. I said that like an hour ago and everybody
[6531.82s -> 6559.18s]  told me I was a dumb person. What was that? There's actual noise behind me. I'm not playing that.
[6560.46s -> 6584.15s]  I'm not doing a werewolf thing again. Oh, it's, it's you. Okay. I, I'm over that. What level am I
[6584.15s -> 6616.58s]  for? Something's right there. I'm still playing this. Yeah, that's all right. I'm having a good
[6616.58s -> 6626.31s]  time. That's not a bite. That's just a little pull. I feel like this is going to be a big one.
[6626.87s -> 6631.53s]  Right there. Come on. Right there. Right there. Right there. Right there. Right there. Right there.
[6631.53s -> 6650.10s]  Pull it down. Get that pet food. Oh, this is the good shit. Nice. Oh, impossible to place. Oh,
[6651.91s -> 6673.99s]  I can't take this one. I have a full bag. I think it might be time to go to another place.
[6676.74s -> 6692.60s]  Sell, sell. Is there a, wait, hold on. Can I just sell? Backpack. Fish keeper. Okay. How do I,
[6692.60s -> 6700.62s]  can I sell early morning, early morning pet food? How do I, can I sell specials, licenses, fish
[6700.62s -> 6724.63s]  keeper? I don't think I can do anything else with this. Dude, look at it in 3D. Yeah, this,
[6724.63s -> 6730.47s]  I gotta release this one. All right. So we got one pound, one pound. I want at least another,
[6730.47s -> 6744.01s]  at least one pound. Give me like another full pound catfish and we can go. This is the good
[6744.01s -> 6762.15s]  spot for the catfish right here. This is a good one. But what is that bird? That is the most
[6762.15s -> 6773.46s]  distinct bird. I know what that is. Is it a chickadee? The one that goes, I hear it's,
[6773.46s -> 6803.40s]  it's the only thing that they do. I gotta recast this. Oh, by the way, Lewis cheese, Lewis cheese,
[6803.40s -> 6813.38s]  Lewis cheese. It's time for you to wake up. Lewis cheese. Wake up now. Wake up now. Lewis cheese.
[6813.38s -> 6826.97s]  You guys were fucking early. I looked over here. I was going to do it in about 20, 30 seconds
[6826.97s -> 6840.36s]  because it was 1 54 30 is when I need to do it. You guys did it so early. He's here. All right.
[6841.00s -> 6847.08s]  You guys have given this, this, this poor dude, you've given like 5,000 dings. I hope this,
[6847.08s -> 6852.36s]  yeah, this, if you have notifications, sounds on Twitch, I didn't even need to say anything.
[6852.36s -> 6859.90s]  You guys just pinged him like fucking 6,000 times. He's probably going to be screaming, holding his
[6859.90s -> 6879.10s]  ears. Let me know when you start playing something entertaining. Thanks. Yeah. What was your name?
[6884.31s -> 6901.37s]  What was your name? Who was that? Who said that? I need one more catfish. Then we'll go somewhere
[6901.37s -> 6912.68s]  else. No, we're not doing this. I, I ain't the front desk at a hotel. I'm not going to.
[6915.94s -> 6937.82s]  Hello, Mr. Albert. It's your 8 AM wake up call. Give me, I gotta go back to the other one. Oh,
[6937.82s -> 6958.92s]  what's going on? Oh, the werewolf is coming back. Well, um, we're staying here. Thanks for recommending
[6958.92s -> 6976.89s]  places in Boston to go. I had a great time. I'm glad you did. Boston's a great city. This stream
[6976.89s -> 6980.65s]  is making people fall asleep actually. So he needs to yell people's usernames to keep viewers up.
[6983.70s -> 6988.34s]  What's the best burger in Boston? I don't know. I actually don't know that answer to that question.
[7006.26s -> 7013.10s]  Best burger in Las Vegas. I got that one. You already know it. Let's already say it for me.
[7013.74s -> 7037.67s]  I'm not Shake Shack. What? Hash House or Go Go? Oh, McDonald's. Who? What? All right. Listen,
[7037.67s -> 7042.39s]  wait, wait, there may be people here that were not here when I've talked about this before a few
[7042.39s -> 7051.37s]  times at the link. It's the name of a casino. It's a casino hotel. There is a restaurant inside of
[7051.37s -> 7058.33s]  that restaurant is a little place that we like to call Hash House or Go Go. It is a 24 hour
[7058.33s -> 7071.00s]  establishment. And inside there, there's an expansive menu of chicken, hamburger, waffles,
[7072.04s -> 7085.10s]  24 hours. There is a burger on that menu, which I highly recommend. It is the blue cheese stuffed
[7085.10s -> 7095.66s]  burger under the hamburger section. It is the best hamburger I have ever had in my entire life.
[7096.81s -> 7105.35s]  All right. We're on a fishing trip. Somebody's asleep and no one's listening to. I'm like so
[7105.35s -> 7118.98s]  close to this person's ear telling them this. Why am I turning like a castaway like Tom Hanks right
[7118.98s -> 7127.83s]  now? I'm like losing my mind. God just wakes up. Dude, what are you talking? What's, what are you
[7127.83s -> 7135.46s]  doing? Did anything, did I get any bites? Sorry. I just, I just, I needed to like make sure you knew.
[7147.00s -> 7151.78s]  Wake up, wake up. Inception.
[7153.62s -> 7158.90s]  Everyone's asleep. I get up and I stand in front of them and I do a full like just presentation.
[7159.54s -> 7174.98s]  I need to tell you this. It's so important. Hash House or Go Go. Bring your laptop over. Yeah,
[7174.98s -> 7195.54s]  open it up. I need one more fish and I can get out of here. But for real, the burger at Hash
[7195.54s -> 7204.89s]  House or Go Go in the Link is so good. I've not eaten a hamburger that was better than that
[7204.89s -> 7235.66s]  in my life. L-I-N-Q the Link. Somebody eat this. Now I can't speak. I know there are other Hash
[7235.66s -> 7241.66s]  House or Go Go's, but I cannot speak to the quality of the other ones. Whether the executive chef is
[7241.66s -> 7251.61s]  of the Las Vegas in the Link chef. That's the one I'm speaking of. So if you go to Hash House or Go
[7251.61s -> 7258.09s]  Go in Florida or something and you're like, this sucks. Well, I, you're not the right one.
[7271.37s -> 7276.10s]  I have to, okay. I think of my games broken. I do. I think of my game. My game is broken. I need to
[7276.10s -> 7283.94s]  go that. Okay. Finally I can walk over here now. Do I like shellfish? I'm one of those weirdos that
[7283.94s -> 7291.70s]  loves crab, but hates lobster. It just, it seems impossible. It seems so stupid and impossible,
[7291.70s -> 7300.97s]  but it's, it's true. See, that's weird. Same really. I was assuming people are going to think that was
[7300.97s -> 7321.50s]  odd. Here we go. Crab takes a lot of work. Yeah. That's why I usually just have somebody do it for
[7321.50s -> 7328.74s]  me. That's not big enough. That's not big enough. What do you mean? I can't keep this? Why didn't I
[7328.74s -> 7337.16s]  throw away one? It's too much weight. I only have 4.4 pounds. I need a bigger fish hut. Damn it.
[7338.04s -> 7348.58s]  Okay. That's what's going on. Fish hut medium 15 pounds. All right. That's the problem.
[7349.22s -> 7353.93s]  What am I? I can't keep. All right. I have to leave. I have to go back to my house.
[7354.81s -> 7365.54s]  All right. I'm out. Back to my house. King crab is my favorite. Probably my favorite seafood.
[7365.54s -> 7369.86s]  Somewhere. King crab is similar. King crab is expensive. I don't, you can't really get it
[7369.86s -> 7386.68s]  all the time, but it is, I love king crab. Blue crab. Blue crab is good, but I, it has a different
[7386.68s -> 7392.44s]  flavor profile for me. I'm not a huge fan of blue crab or like dungeon crab. I've had dungeon crab
[7392.44s -> 7398.28s]  once and it was strange. It was really, it was like a very ammonia tasting story. It was very
[7398.28s -> 7413.48s]  weird. I didn't like it. Dungeon crab. Is that my dungeon? Dungeon? Yeah. Rocky Lake. What level
[7413.48s -> 7425.99s]  my four? Any fours? Dungeon is crab is harbor trash. No, there's, there's a really expensive
[7425.99s -> 7433.61s]  crab that I really didn't like and I could, I could barely eat it. Damn it. I need, what level
[7433.61s -> 7443.80s]  do I need to be? Is there any fives? No, that's, this is not here. What about snow crab? I don't
[7443.80s -> 7450.39s]  know. I, Rocky Lake's the next one. I need to go home. Inventory. All right. Where's my stuff?
[7451.35s -> 7459.91s]  Home. There we are. Mudspin 1200. Get that on. Mono 007. Two, that's, I, that's, I don't know.
[7459.91s -> 7475.64s]  I have no idea. Can I put this on? Fish hut medium. Why can I not put this on? Something
[7475.64s -> 7489.85s]  going on here? Backpack. Do I like calamari? Only fried. I think it's just open some loot boxes.
[7489.85s -> 7499.66s]  There are no loot boxes in this game. Is it just on or am I not allowed to use this yet?
[7502.34s -> 7514.09s]  I think that's on, right? Well, whatever. I'm going to, who likes cheese? Anybody in Lone Star
[7514.09s -> 7525.19s]  like cheese? Shiner. Dough balls. Dough balls. Pet food. Ooh. I'm going, I'm going back to town.
[7525.19s -> 7543.96s]  Let's see. Catfish right here. Pet food. Leeches. I have pet food right now. But yeah. King crab's
[7543.96s -> 7561.58s]  my favorite. Holy shit. Look at how misty it is. Now this is cool. I would go fishing like this.
[7562.30s -> 7573.48s]  Uh oh. He's queuing up the werewolf sound again. No, I'm not. Don't listen to these
[7573.48s -> 7582.73s]  liars in chat. They're lying to you. You vape. We get it. Oh yeah. I still have to do that.
[7583.61s -> 7586.76s]  I still have to do that thing that I was going to do a long time ago.
[7587.64s -> 7594.18s]  And remember that thing that I was going to do? I don't think any of you guys remember.
[7594.18s -> 7597.70s]  Maybe I shouldn't talk about it then. That's, it's just, it's just, it's just stupid.
[7598.26s -> 7609.24s]  I remember. All right. Some people remember and promise a lot of things. Yeah, I do. I don't
[7609.24s -> 7615.48s]  promise anything. I just come up with ideas and then I see minus two, minus three, and then I go,
[7615.48s -> 7634.20s]  oh, that's not a good idea. Maybe I should change my plans. You promised Dr. Oz in the next rumble.
[7634.20s -> 7641.93s]  I know. You think I forgot? That's one of the most important new characters. How could I forget that?
[7654.94s -> 7669.53s]  Any bites? Nah. Did you wake up Louis Cheese? I did. I promised Ace Attorney. No, I didn't. I said
[7669.53s -> 7673.05s]  I was going to check it out off stream and see if I wanted to stream it and it turned out I did not
[7673.05s -> 7699.62s]  want to stream it. I was very honest. Nothing over here. Changing spots. You promised you would start
[7699.62s -> 7710.31s]  drinking wine instead of beer. I don't drink beer. I drink, for low alcohol content, beverages for
[7710.31s -> 7720.74s]  alcohol, I drink wine and I drink red wine. Well, I don't drink beer. You guys, you guys have known
[7720.74s -> 7750.30s]  that for almost two years. Fucking werewolf. What about high alcohol content? Good vodkas, like high,
[7750.86s -> 7761.70s]  quality vodkas. Not the fingernail polish removal. That's like four bucks for a handle. No.
[7765.50s -> 7781.88s]  And scotches. I like whiskey. I don't drink it that much anymore though. Crystal Skull, Dan
[7781.88s -> 7798.04s]  Ackroyd vodka. Crystal Skull actually was pretty good. It was not bad. I didn't hate it. You know
[7798.04s -> 7806.44s]  what I do want to get though is I want to get, I want to get Stone Cold's beer. What's it called?
[7806.44s -> 7814.07s]  Like Stone Cold's beer. It's like Skull, like Skull Crusher or something. It's called something.
[7814.07s -> 7828.30s]  I want to try it. Broken Skull IPA. There it is. Has anybody had Broken Skull? I'm not a big beer
[7828.30s -> 7842.38s]  drinker, but I mean, I feel like I've been pretty good. It's really good. I have to put new bait on.
[7842.38s -> 7857.21s]  This is ridiculous. It's pretty good. I'm going to track it down. IPAs taste like a new carpet.
[7876.31s -> 7884.71s]  Is there a certain like time of day should I put new bait on? Do I like it? That song always kind
[7884.71s -> 7890.87s]  of jumps up on me. All right, Pep Foods is not doing it. Let's go back to worms. I need to get
[7890.87s -> 7902.49s]  to level five. Can I buy a casting rod? I don't think I can. Rods. Value Spin. Telefloat. Value
[7902.49s -> 7915.11s]  Spin. Is this a casting? There's a lot of money. I only have 2100 bucks. Spinning rod. Value Spin.
[7918.84s -> 7938.15s]  Okay, well I own it. Try Polish vodka. It's incredible. Yeah, there are some really good
[7938.15s -> 7951.19s]  vodkas. There are. I worried about my sleeping schedule, but this stream fixed it. You're welcome.
[7951.83s -> 7971.54s]  I'm glad I can be of service. I got a bluegill. Jerma, look at the game chat. You know, I've never
[7972.26s -> 7978.02s]  once ever thought it was something that I was going to do or been told to pay attention to in
[7978.02s -> 8011.08s]  game chat. I will take things that I've never thought of to do for 5000 Alec. You guys couldn't
[8011.08s -> 8026.41s]  press minus two fast enough for that one. Well, that's good. Why am I trying to game minus twos?
[8026.41s -> 8030.97s]  I should be trying to game plus twos. That's how it works, right? I have to balance it out.
[8031.77s -> 8050.06s]  He's fighting like crazy. Don't take this fish to avoid a hundred dollar fine. This is my backyard.
[8050.06s -> 8074.47s]  What? Fish verification in progress. What? I don't have a license to be here? I thought I did. It's
[8074.47s -> 8094.92s]  still the same day, isn't it? It's not a different state. Your license has a maximum. Isn't it the
[8094.92s -> 8105.35s]  same day? Oh no, it's the next day. Well, I just need to get to level five and I can go to the next
[8105.35s -> 8129.91s]  area. That's all I care about. Come here. They didn't verify that fish on Twitter. I'm not verified
[8129.91s -> 8149.80s]  on Twitter. Like my Twitter could be fake. I don't put anything there worth any real value to anybody
[8149.88s -> 8168.58s]  besides the like stream starting message. Oh, what's that? That's new. Blacktail Shiner.
[8168.58s -> 8204.06s]  This used to be a main A stream. Well, that's a, that's like a 2014 reference. Whoa, that thing is
[8204.06s -> 8238.46s]  big. Big but small. Wide but short. 39 bucks. Worms are doing a good job today. It's a larper.
[8238.62s -> 8246.65s]  Come on. Where was there? How much money is it to go to the next area?
[8247.37s -> 8254.31s]  I'm gonna move this way. I'm gonna get close to friends. What do you do with the fishes that you
[8254.31s -> 8270.57s]  catch? You sell them. Okay. Are you fishing or are you like trying to get free television?
[8274.14s -> 8287.08s]  Oh my god. That can't be real. That's a joke. This is, that's a radio tower. This is not a fishing
[8287.08s -> 8301.29s]  pole. How do you cast this? I feel like the only way to cast this is if you spin in a circle for
[8301.29s -> 8331.77s]  five, 10 straight seconds and then just let it go. Holy shit. That thing is big. Give me level five.
[8331.77s -> 8336.33s]  Wow. I forget what that. Remember what I said at the beginning of the stream? This is how it happens.
[8337.51s -> 8361.86s]  10 minutes or three hours. Yeah. Yeah. We made it. Oh, a crappy. But why? I don't know.
[8362.18s -> 8371.30s]  It, sometimes it's nice just to talk to you guys. You know, level five reached. Let's go.
[8376.90s -> 8385.85s]  Rocky Lake, Colorado. I unlocked dough balls, grub one, uh, schlopp schlopp schlopp spoon,
[8386.89s -> 8392.74s]  narrow spoon, spinner, flies. Oh, cool. I got to, okay. This is where the level,
[8392.74s -> 8400.36s]  this is where the game really begins. Look at all this stuff. Open feeder. All right. And then I want
[8400.36s -> 8408.73s]  to go back in inventory, go home. I want my, I want my rod. I'm going to go back to my house,
[8408.73s -> 8429.54s]  right? I am in my house. 196 bucks. All right. Inventory. Where's the rod? Home. Here we are.
[8430.49s -> 8438.81s]  Okay. Value spin. Six, three. Item can, item can be replaced only with item of the same type.
[8439.69s -> 8457.58s]  What are you talking about? What does that mean? I'm already using this one?
[8458.30s -> 8468.12s]  Oh, all right. Shit. This is all right. Camo vest, fish hut, extra small. I think that I already
[8468.12s -> 8476.18s]  have it on. All right. I got it on. I have a new, the rod is on. I need a new hook. Shop. Wait, how
[8476.18s -> 8484.98s]  much is it to go to, uh, Colorado? Rocky Lake. It's $2,000 to go here. Come on. And a license.
[8485.94s -> 8495.13s]  Six. So I need 2,600 bucks to go to Colorado. Damn it. All right. I can do this. Let's just go
[8495.13s -> 8501.34s]  back to Mud River. I still have a license. 821, right? Let's go. 1,200 bucks to be there for a
[8501.34s -> 8522.95s]  day. What? I just go here. I just need to make money. It's time to grind. No, I only need like
[8524.50s -> 8534.02s]  five, 600 bucks. It really is an MMO, isn't it? Yeah, it kind of is. Is this the new rod?
[8538.39s -> 8547.61s]  I think this is the new rod. Hello. Four, five, six, two, four, five, six, two.
[8552.09s -> 8570.65s]  Uh, the water is over here. I didn't even, I guess I caught that. This is gonna take a while.
[8571.45s -> 8596.76s]  How do I make money fast? You can't. I just want to see Colorado. Damn it. I gotta get back to
[8596.76s -> 8612.52s]  throwing it. It's not the shore. I'm gonna go on the bridge. What's on there? Worms? Yeah. I need
[8612.52s -> 8625.13s]  money. All right. I'm just gonna fill my backpack. 15 pounds. Shouldn't take long. It actually,
[8625.13s -> 8637.26s]  it may take potentially like an hour. No, well, 24 bucks. All right. Keep it. Five, you know,
[8637.26s -> 8650.01s]  10, 20 more of those. Just buy it? No. I'm not hitting the free to play wall and climbing over
[8650.01s -> 8667.19s]  it with a briefcase full of money. Yes, there's somebody standing here. There is. In case you
[8667.51s -> 8678.06s]  didn't know. These things are so cheap. I need something bitter. Like an IPA. That sounds good
[8678.06s -> 8707.13s]  to me. Something bigger. I caught a fish. How do you do like a thumbs up? I guess, hold on. When you,
[8707.13s -> 8751.00s]  when in doubt, just do Homer Simpson. No! That's Homer Simpson. Sideways. Homer Simpson. Look, it's,
[8751.80s -> 8764.76s]  imagine Homer Simpson lying down on his bed. On his back. You can't see that?
[8774.89s -> 8789.05s]  Bait was eaten. Horn wart? I wish there was in-game voice. I would be right behind this guy and I
[8789.05s -> 8803.10s]  would just turn on the voice and I would go and do it until he until he turned around. No more bait.
[8810.79s -> 8819.75s]  Pet food. I want to catch one of the, let me just check and see something here. Species. Channel
[8819.75s -> 8822.79s]  catfish. Pet food. There's, there are over, they are, they're over here.
[8823.93s -> 8838.52s]  Somewhere. Stay out of my spot. We can share. Look, you guys should be able to get along. You
[8838.52s -> 8846.74s]  both shop at the same clothing store. In fact, so do I. And we should all be friends because
[8847.38s -> 8858.47s]  we all go to the same store. We're all wearing the same like plaid shirts. All right, I'm going this
[8858.47s -> 8866.82s]  way. Get out of his spot. No, there is no my spot in this game. We share it as a group of fishermen.
[8867.70s -> 8886.09s]  This is definitely big enough for all of us to stay here. They both have those gigantic antennas.
[8894.23s -> 8909.86s]  26 bucks. How much? I have 1.7 pounds. There, this is my spot now. You don't have to complain
[8909.86s -> 8968.28s]  about me being in your spot. Lots of drama in the planet fishing competitive community. That's a
[8968.28s -> 8992.20s]  good one. Kick. You can't kick people. Do you think that that is a service available in this game?
[8993.16s -> 9062.17s]  Kill them with kindness. See? Like, no, why are they going over to the lily pads? That's passive
[9062.17s -> 9081.00s]  aggressive. You can pass time with tea. I waited an hour to remove the fog. What? No, you can't.
[9081.80s -> 9097.05s]  Is that real? But what about everybody else on the server? This ain't working. This is, this spot
[9097.13s -> 9158.09s]  sucks. Somebody give, somebody give $50? Oh no, that means that they're watching. Oh man, okay,
[9158.09s -> 9168.81s]  big bitch. Casted it back out. Oh my god. That was, thank you shitty viewbot for the 5,000
[9168.81s -> 9178.82s]  bits. 50 bucks. Big bits. Challenge the toxic fisher to a 1v1. You won't do it, I bet.
[9179.91s -> 9183.43s]  Well, thank you, shitty viewbot for the $50. It's a huge amount of money.
[9184.07s -> 9187.99s]  And, um, they're probably watching the stream right now. In fact, they're right next to me.
[9190.94s -> 9197.96s]  Uh, how about this? Whoever gets the next, next fish, whoever has the bigger fish, pound wise,
[9199.35s -> 9214.81s]  wins. Starting right now. I love the eye, eye blinking. That's the kind of eye blinking that's
[9214.81s -> 9222.38s]  like, motherfucker, you think you're gonna, mm, mm, whoever gets the bigger fish, right? I fucking
[9222.38s -> 9235.72s]  guarantee it's gonna be me. Asshole. That was, that was going on inside of the head there.
[9236.44s -> 9255.21s]  There's this place at the Link Casino Resort, Hash House of GoGo. Some of the finest hamburgers
[9255.21s -> 9266.06s]  you'll ever eat in your life. Tasty, juicy, full of flavor. With a dash of Worcestershire sauce.
[9295.24s -> 9302.84s]  There's no fish over here. There's no fish over here. I'm, all right, I'm going back to,
[9302.84s -> 9317.62s]  I'm going back to your spot. Stop using the pet food. I want a, I want a catfish. They're over here.
[9317.62s -> 9341.46s]  And they eat the pet food. It's their favorite food. That thing's fucking tiny. Oh, that's not
[9341.46s -> 9345.94s]  even the same guy. Not even the right guy. What I meant to say was that, that's a good fish.
[9349.94s -> 9360.98s]  Oh, my stomach. I thought he was coming to show. I thought it was the guy going,
[9360.98s -> 9368.39s]  yeah, look what I got. Here we go. This is my time to shine. Look at this thing. This thing is huge.
[9370.66s -> 9381.96s]  Holy shit. That's 10 inches. 10 inches. What do you got? Hold it up. I just saw it on the line.
[9381.96s -> 9403.64s]  Did he throw it away? I think he threw it away. Disqualification automatic one.
[9403.64s -> 9425.99s]  0.7 pounds. Where is it? Oh, it doesn't say 0.2. Did you get something? I'm waiting. 0.748,
[9425.99s -> 9433.18s]  10.1 inches. We'll see it. You can't lie. This game has a, a kill feed, a fish feed.
[9433.90s -> 9453.85s]  All right. We know what I got. He's telling the truth. All right. Fine. Round. Did he actually
[9453.85s -> 9465.93s]  win that first round? Cause this is round one, two out of three. Scroll up the chat. I can't,
[9465.93s -> 9479.03s]  how do you scroll up? I can't. I'm watching his stream. Yes. He's got a better pole than me,
[9479.03s -> 9484.23s]  though. He's got a bigger pole. He's got a more like, he's got more experience in the game.
[9484.23s -> 9493.90s]  All right. This is it. What'd he get? 0.97 pound trophy bluegill, 0.66 pound sunfish.
[9494.70s -> 9508.30s]  Well, how long was it though? Smaller fish. Yeah. Well, I, we don't use them the same rods.
[9509.02s -> 9516.38s]  It wouldn't be no change in the rules. This is like having a boxing match,
[9517.66s -> 9525.30s]  but I don't have to put on boxing gloves. That's not fair. That person's going to beat the shit out
[9525.30s -> 9538.49s]  of the other person. If we're at a competition, why do I get to, why do you have to wear boxing
[9538.49s -> 9556.42s]  gloves? But I don't, I can just like punch with my hands. Boxing gloves protect the hand, not the
[9556.42s -> 9571.22s]  other person. It doesn't protect the other person's face. Do you see what I'm getting at here? No,
[9571.22s -> 9575.94s]  I'm saying without the boxing gloves, if a boxer punches somebody in the face, it's going to do
[9575.94s -> 9595.56s]  like damage. Boxing gloves are worn to make it so they don't like, they don't do damage. What do
[9595.56s -> 9615.70s]  you guys think boxing gloves are for? For boxing? Is he showing me his fish? I'm not paying attention.
[9645.38s -> 9648.74s]  I must have been thinking of, I must have been, I'm sorry guys. Let me correct myself. I must
[9648.74s -> 9652.98s]  have been thinking of sockum buffers. That's what I was thinking of. Wrong thing, wrong sport.
[9658.92s -> 9665.74s]  He got one. What is it? A 0.2 pound, 0.29 pound. I can do better than that.
[9699.88s -> 9712.55s]  Push him. That's so fucked up.
[9718.07s -> 9724.71s]  Soccer shoes are for protecting the feet. No, how come you don't just walk around barefoot?
[9725.51s -> 9755.02s]  It's nice work. He didn't win. I need to catch something. He won twice.
[9756.46s -> 9774.44s]  I get to win. I get to win because it's my stream. I get to win. It's my stream. He won on his stream.
[9775.00s -> 9786.97s]  Yeah, so now I get to win on my stream. I'm just going both hands just into the water. Fuck,
[9786.97s -> 9814.30s]  I missed my time. What's he got? Uh oh. Let me see. 0.5. I can do so much better than this.
[9814.30s -> 9819.50s]  I'm just not getting distracted by talking about how boxing gloves hurt more or something. I don't
[9819.50s -> 9847.27s]  even remember what it was. Come on. Why are they getting stuff and not me? I got to take pet food
[9847.27s -> 9857.46s]  off. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Here it is. Oh, this is a big one. This is a big one. This
[9857.46s -> 9865.56s]  thing is fucking huge. Look at that thing. Don't break the line. This is the biggest fish in the
[9865.56s -> 9878.33s]  whole fucking lake. Too much tension. No, no, no, no. Look at this thing. It's like a whale.
[9878.97s -> 9902.98s]  Come here. Come here. Can he grab onto my hips and pull me forward? It's getting away. Come on.
[9902.98s -> 9915.72s]  It's right there. Where is it? Holy shit.
[9921.64s -> 9939.27s]  Three and a half pounds. 18 inches long. That's a small mouth buffalo. 81 bucks. You got it.
[9939.27s -> 9960.71s]  Let's take a look. Take a look. That's as big as as we are tall. Let me stand back. You win.
[9960.71s -> 9976.79s]  Winner is you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I lost the first two. It's okay. Keeping this one. Let's go back to
[9976.79s -> 10011.77s]  back. Throw it at him. No, why is that not? It's only supposed to be like five up. Oh, come on.
[10011.77s -> 10046.33s]  It's supposed to only be five up. Give me a break. Someone on here doesn't even need to try. I'm so
[10046.33s -> 10054.17s]  happy about that. This was worth the three hours in this game. New pond, new pond. I need, I don't
[10054.17s -> 10071.83s]  have any money. I need more money. Is it worth another three hours? I don't think so, but I'm
[10071.83s -> 10085.24s]  not giving up yet. Not until we get to the new pond. I'm not going anywhere. What's the name of
[10085.24s -> 10092.78s]  this game? It's called Fishing Planet, I think. Planet Fish. One of those two. Just type in
[10092.78s -> 10114.60s]  Fishing. Fishing Planet. Why the second one? I feel like the spot was right here.
[10118.22s -> 10122.04s]  I'm not going to play a Dance Dance Revolution game. That's not going to happen.
[10122.60s -> 10126.30s]  I'm sorry to get everybody's hopes up, but I'm not going to play that game on stream.
[10131.42s -> 10138.58s]  You can go ahead. You can ride. That's fine. It's not going to happen. And if I ever did it,
[10138.58s -> 10160.89s]  I would be sober. All right. 34. Oh, how much money am I? Okay. I'm going to fill the backpack.
[10161.69s -> 10172.26s]  You couldn't dance sober. Actually, I do know how to dance fairly well. And not like, not like,
[10172.26s -> 10178.71s]  oh, look, I'm jokey. I'm wearing a fat suit yesterday. No. With the right beat, I can move.
[10179.35s -> 10194.89s]  That's not a lie. That's for real. With the right beat, I can move. I'm hitting my body. My legs can
[10194.89s -> 10206.14s]  spin around. Nobody does the finger snaps anymore. That needs to come back. Like the wrist,
[10206.14s -> 10212.06s]  the wrist and the elbow go down. Bang. Bang. Bang. Why did that go out of style?
[10242.92s -> 10252.94s]  Hasn't he? I'm still waiting for you boomers to move on. No. Go look at the green screen dancing.
[10252.94s -> 10259.32s]  Remember when I was like moving my legs around? Like bang. I was doing some like leg snaps.
[10259.88s -> 10263.00s]  Go watch the full screen green screen dancing and you tell me that was bad.
[10276.65s -> 10292.49s]  You did one good clip. Oh, did only one. It was like four. You did dad dancing. No, I did not.
[10295.02s -> 10302.12s]  That there's a very dad dancing is two fists up. The your left hand goes slightly above.
[10302.12s -> 10311.56s]  Look, I'll just show you. This is the dad dance. It's like this. Two fists. One hand is slightly
[10311.56s -> 10323.05s]  above the other one. And it's up down like this. That's the dad dance. I used to film weddings. I
[10323.05s -> 10363.61s]  know. Why do I have grandma hair? Because I fucking want it. Did you get paid to film weddings or did
[10363.61s -> 10368.65s]  you just what you do? You act like I'm just like filming a wedding that I'm what are you talking
[10368.65s -> 10397.02s]  about? Why would I do that? Yes, it was a service that I was hired to do. All right. You kind of
[10397.02s -> 10409.96s]  look like a creep to be honest. What kind of like what kind of comment is that? That's a comment
[10410.60s -> 10416.44s]  I would remove typically. I'm going to remove that comment. I'm going to remove that one. I think.
[10417.78s -> 10444.89s]  No, it's already gone. It's all right. You only read mean messages because they put a fish next
[10444.89s -> 10470.46s]  to it or they put it in red text. All right. I'm on. I got it. This ain't working. I got to move.
[10471.18s -> 10489.42s]  I want to go a spot that I haven't gone to before. Like over here. Here we go.
[10489.42s -> 10497.34s]  Phylactery Lich just gave four gifted subs. Thank you Phylactery. If you missed last night,
[10497.34s -> 10505.00s]  Phylactery gave an absolute shitload of money on top of this and it looks like we're getting
[10505.00s -> 10517.40s]  part two of that. There's 20 more from Phylactery Lich. 20 more community subs. That was 24 which
[10517.40s -> 10529.13s]  makes 420. There you go. I get it. It's been fulfilled. Yes. Thank you so much though for
[10529.13s -> 10540.76s]  those community subs. It's a lot of subs. 24, 420. What am I? What's going on? Is this a big one?
[10541.40s -> 10554.06s]  I think I got stuck on a lily pad. Wait, pull this back. What is this? I don't even. How am I
[10554.06s -> 10564.28s]  doing this? What the fuck? How did I do that? I could do a super cast. That didn't even go that
[10564.28s -> 10599.61s]  far. What? I'm missing something here. Am I going to aim up? I can't. That doesn't work. Why is there
[10599.77s -> 10637.48s]  cat? Got it. Okay, $29. Where'd it go? Why didn't do that when I can just do this? It goes further.
[10637.48s -> 10667.35s]  Can we get another blue cheese burger ad please? Fishing level almost level six. Run ads. Not with
[10667.35s -> 10682.86s]  4,000 people here. How do you do the long cast? It's you hold it. If you have the right,
[10685.80s -> 10695.62s]  you hold right. Bugs. Okay. All right. What's that? Red with honey. All right. I got some new stuff
[10695.62s -> 10713.56s]  here. Nah, no ads. Getting to 15 pounds and hoping that's enough money. New lake. I'm trying. I need
[10713.56s -> 10726.94s]  to get to 15 pounds so I can sell all my fish. Answer their question. What do you mean? What
[10726.94s -> 10740.17s]  question? What was it? Was somebody in here? Who said something? Don't get stuck in the tree. All
[10740.17s -> 10752.68s]  right. These are all 35, 35, 35. They might be enough. How did I forget that fast? Because
[10752.68s -> 10758.84s]  there's, I don't know, there's like three or four things going on at the same time. I forgot. I did.
[10758.84s -> 10774.12s]  I have no idea what's going on. What happened? Hydrate from the pond. Okay. You hold right click
[10775.00s -> 10785.90s]  and then you press left click. If you have the right bow, the right rod. That's a $36 fish
[10785.90s -> 10801.48s]  right there. 11.2 pounds. I can do like three or four more, but it kind of sucks that I couldn't
[10801.48s -> 10818.79s]  get it to work. That's a big one. Don't take this fish. I'll take a, that's all right. I'll
[10818.79s -> 10844.86s]  take a $44 fine. Verifying. I still get to keep it. What was the thing that we were talking about
[10844.86s -> 10860.01s]  before? I forget what it was. It was not the best ice cream. Oh, ads. Right. Yeah. I'm not
[10860.01s -> 10865.38s]  going to run ads because when you run an ad, if I were to do like three minutes of ads right now,
[10865.94s -> 10887.38s]  1500 people would probably try it. No, I don't, I don't run ads on my stream. This is an ad free
[10887.38s -> 10892.92s]  viewing experience. I can't control when you come to the stream, if you get a pre-roll,
[10893.64s -> 10917.06s]  but I, this is an ad free viewing experience. I don't run ads ever. My default dance. How much
[10917.06s -> 10923.99s]  money do I make if I run an ad? I have no idea. I don't have any, I have no gauge to tell you that.
[10924.63s -> 10941.38s]  I don't do it. So I can't really tell you. He gave us ads during Terraria. Yeah. As a joke.
[10942.66s -> 10960.62s]  All right. There's a fish are all gone in here. You guys stole them all right here, right in the
[10960.62s -> 10971.69s]  lilies. No, this is also a joke ad. You literally caught the three sunfish. I need one of I'm sorry.
[10971.69s -> 11008.44s]  Well, you got a two pounder. Oh no, that's not you. What would you rate this game? Um, uh, come
[11008.44s -> 11031.21s]  back to me in like 20 more minutes. I have to deliberate on this one. Uh, four, but, but, but,
[11031.37s -> 11046.47s]  but, but, but, but it gets, it gets two and a half extra points full on that meter for being
[11046.47s -> 11061.40s]  relaxing. So it's a 4.2 out of 10, but it turns into like a 6.8, 6.6. That's a good one. 6.65.
[11062.20s -> 11075.90s]  Cause I could see like two or three of my friends just hanging out,
[11075.90s -> 11082.74s]  just catching fish and comparing how big they are. It's free. It's free to just do what I'm
[11082.74s -> 11088.26s]  doing right now. There's no reason to not at least try it if you wanted to play a fishing game,
[11088.26s -> 11106.65s]  whatever. It's just here. Increments of a thousand. What? 6.65. That's increments of a hundred.
[11107.91s -> 11130.98s]  So yeah, it's a 665. It's a, it's a 441 without the extra 2.2 percentage, 2.2, 221,
[11131.38s -> 11134.74s]  whatever, of friend interaction points. You get it. And it's free.
[11135.54s -> 11146.62s]  You've messed me up with this whole hundred point scale right now. This thousand point,
[11146.62s -> 11156.90s]  hundreds, hundreds of a decibel denomination. It's a four out of 10 with 2.6 extra points
[11156.90s -> 11180.71s]  of friend and free interaction. Just say seven out of 10. I wouldn't give this a seven out of 10.
[11191.06s -> 11202.42s]  It's point scales, point scales are dumb anyways. Do you know why? Cause everybody's afraid to give
[11202.42s -> 11212.82s]  any game a rating. You give a game like a six and you anger a bunch of people. You give a game like
[11212.82s -> 11221.54s]  a nine and you anger a bunch of people. Everyone's terrified to rate anything. That's not a 7.5 to
[11221.54s -> 11233.98s]  like an 8.8. Star made a whole video on this. That video is, I will go down in history saying
[11233.98s -> 11240.36s]  that I think that is the best YouTube video ever made. That is the best video game related YouTube
[11240.36s -> 11255.96s]  video. I'm just going to say it. I think it is the everything is an eight out of 10 star video.
[11255.96s -> 11274.17s]  I think it's, it's got some great comedy points on it. Just put it on the corner of the stream.
[11281.64s -> 11292.52s]  No, no, I said, no, no, no, no, no, no. Everyone needs to like what I like.
[11293.40s -> 11309.24s]  Anger face. Can I please catch one more fish? I got to put the worms back on.
[11309.80s -> 11315.82s]  I got like three, four in a row and I haven't seen any paper view. Would you guys, would you
[11315.82s -> 11325.14s]  guys watch a pay per view stream? Just curious. If it, if it was like $12 to watch a stream,
[11325.14s -> 11339.22s]  would you do it? No, not like me playing fishing. What if it was like German rumble live two and
[11339.22s -> 11345.19s]  they were like, and they were like five WWF superstars in it. And I, and I promised that I
[11345.19s -> 11351.67s]  was going to take a chair hit in the face. Like you knew at some point during that stream, I was
[11351.67s -> 11356.97s]  going to take a real chair shot to the face for real. And I would like train and practice and do
[11356.97s -> 11375.58s]  it. No, I would never do something like that. Didn't they, they just recently did the
[11377.42s -> 11385.22s]  sub streams, right? I would never do that ever. I can't think of one reason to do it. Maybe I,
[11385.22s -> 11393.18s]  no, I can't. It's hard to think of a reason why. If you do a sub only stream, that stream is just
[11393.18s -> 11402.12s]  going to be restreamed on YouTube on like 500 accounts. It's just how are you going to stop
[11402.12s -> 11411.06s]  that you alienate and annoy a huge amount of your audience, a majority of your whole audience.
[11411.70s -> 11415.06s]  And it doesn't even matter anyways, because somebody will just, it's just going to clip it
[11415.06s -> 11437.48s]  and put it somewhere else. Use it as a prank. The way I see it is like a maybe a private creative
[11437.48s -> 11444.12s]  stream, like a review mentorship thing. Yeah, I honestly, I forget about sub only streams.
[11445.61s -> 11451.61s]  Why not? I mean, maybe is a bandwidth a concern? No, why would anybody can just stream on Twitch?
[11451.61s -> 11461.11s]  Why don't have password streams? Or just, you know, that would be right. Instead of sub only,
[11461.11s -> 11479.10s]  why not do password protected streams? It's kind of the same thing, isn't it? The password is sub.
[11481.14s -> 11484.58s]  Password stream could have use. Yeah, you could do like company. Well, I think didn't,
[11484.58s -> 11490.79s]  Discord really is starting to drop this whole thing here, right? With doing private streams.
[11492.73s -> 11496.33s]  It used to be, this is now, here's a story for you. Back in the day, and I'm talking maybe
[11497.05s -> 11501.80s]  six, seven, eight years ago, if you wanted to, we used to do this thing where somebody would screen
[11501.80s -> 11510.33s]  share on Skype. We'd have a group call going. And we were always begging, begging and hoping
[11510.33s -> 11515.37s]  for a solution just to have kind of a private session where three or four people can just watch.
[11516.84s -> 11521.72s]  It was horrible quality. It was really, really delayed. It was really shitty. It wasn't very
[11521.72s -> 11528.94s]  good. Discord is start is doing that now. And then steam brought in the streaming too. But it was
[11528.94s -> 11536.07s]  super delayed as well. A password protected stream on Twitch is kind of that same deal,
[11536.07s -> 11549.26s]  like a screen share. I have not caught a fish in probably 35 minutes. Something's not something's
[11549.26s -> 11575.59s]  wrong. But sub streams, I feel like you just kind of make a lot of people angry. I think there's one
[11575.59s -> 11582.38s]  way where that works. And it's really, really bad. Honest to God, I think the only way that that
[11582.38s -> 11589.37s]  really works if you wanted to do it is permanently turn it on. It's awful. And that's not I think
[11589.37s -> 11595.38s]  that's a really, really terrible idea. But I like what are you going to turn it on half the time?
[11603.70s -> 11607.94s]  You would never get new viewers. No, but if you get if you mean, if you're gonna go all in on
[11607.94s -> 11612.41s]  something like that, you've got you're gonna go all in on that. I don't think you can kind of do
[11612.41s -> 11617.05s]  that. Like, well, should I I think you either you go all in or you don't. Alright, finally,
[11620.55s -> 11629.10s]  there it is 1000 bucks. All right, but I want to fall back. Have it as a patreon reward. That
[11629.10s -> 11652.23s]  makes sense to maybe what's my discord? Do exclamation discord, you'll find the link public.
[11652.79s -> 11663.02s]  Anybody can join it. Anybody can use it. That's a pretty good one. You already make thousands
[11663.02s -> 11667.72s]  a month from subs and bits. I think that's kind of the like the point too, though, is
[11668.52s -> 11674.60s]  now you if you if you have like a bunch of subs, and you're doing well on Twitch,
[11674.60s -> 11679.18s]  you're doing good on Twitch. I feel like that's like too daint. Why would you do that? Like,
[11679.18s -> 11682.46s]  it's kind of daint. Like, oh, I think I'll turn that on. Like, you don't really need to do that.
[11684.60s -> 11687.80s]  It's not going to gain you any more money. If that's what you're after. I don't think that
[11687.80s -> 11704.41s]  would work. I think that's how you lose money. If money is what you're after. There are other
[11704.41s -> 11717.94s]  avenues to do that. Alright, 14.3. I'm done. No, I can get one more. One more small one.
[11737.14s -> 11743.78s]  Some strivers do sub gate on video playbacks, like on their streams, like on the past broadcasts.
[11745.91s -> 11749.43s]  I would never turn that on. Because if a new viewer comes to your channel and wants to know
[11749.43s -> 11753.67s]  what you're about, they either have the second that they are currently watching, which we've
[11753.67s -> 11758.55s]  talked about, like shitting our diapers before. And that person that has to have a conscious
[11758.55s -> 11764.47s]  decision to go, Oh, look, is there anything else that this guy has here that I can like see if I
[11764.47s -> 11768.31s]  want to watch this or not? Having VODs, let somebody go back and pick something that they
[11768.31s -> 11773.91s]  may think is interesting. And maybe they'll stick around, maybe they'll go, Oh, that was cool. I
[11773.91s -> 11779.03s]  like that stream. That was a fun stream or something, right? When you have a sub gate on
[11779.91s -> 11784.79s]  past broadcasts or on video highlights for Twitch or something, you are banking completely on the
[11784.79s -> 11789.19s]  fact that you are going to be that second that that person comes to the stream is all you got.
[11806.26s -> 11811.78s]  15 point. All right. All right. All right. I've got, I've got, I'm good. Time to end the day. I got,
[11811.78s -> 11822.34s]  how much money do I got? 4,200. We're good. People who aren't subbed can't catch up on streams either
[11822.34s -> 11825.62s]  with it. Oh, that's true too. Like, let's say you subscribe for like three or four months
[11826.58s -> 11831.94s]  and then you unsubscribe, you know, for whatever reason, you know, no one is ever obligated to
[11831.94s -> 11836.68s]  subscribe to anybody's channel. So if you're subbed for a few months and you have, you know,
[11836.68s -> 11840.60s]  you're not watching every single stream, you have a, Oh, I'm subbed. Now I can actually see the other
[11840.60s -> 11845.08s]  content if you wanted to watch it. If you aren't subbed anymore after three, four, five months,
[11845.08s -> 11848.36s]  two months, even one month, whatever, you lose access to the thing that you had before.
[11851.06s -> 11855.98s]  And it's like, I mean, I kind of, I guess that kind of, that's, you know, I just want everybody
[11855.98s -> 11863.69s]  to be able to see stuff that we've already done. I wouldn't, I don't want to put a paywall up for
[11863.69s -> 11874.70s]  stuff that's already been done. I need a license here. One day license in Colorado,
[11882.46s -> 11885.58s]  $2,000 to go here. This is such a joke. Wait, wait, wait, what's in here?
[11886.14s -> 11898.02s]  Crappy. Marshmallows. Have I unlocked marshmallows? Preferred lures. Oh, hold on. I need,
[11898.02s -> 11905.80s]  I need a nano spooner. Nano spinners, nano spoons, nano spoons, nano spoons. Do I have a nano spoon?
[11917.24s -> 11929.29s]  Nano spoon. What do they like to eat? Marshmallows. I can't buy them. Is there a spoon?
[11932.49s -> 11939.56s]  Thing here? Am I just, am I dumb? Oh, I am. Okay. There is more.
[11940.28s -> 11949.59s]  If you didn't know, it would be under lures. All right. Spoon, nano spoon. I think I have to,
[11949.59s -> 11961.69s]  there are 48 pages. Nano, nano spoon, nano spinner, nano spinner, nano spinner, spinner, spinner,
[11964.06s -> 11968.86s]  nano spoons, but I'm not old enough for that. Nano spinner. I guess I'll get this one.
[11969.66s -> 11974.60s]  Which one looks coolest? I'll get the, I'm going to get the Spider-Man one.
[11977.21s -> 11994.52s]  Okay. Barbless nano spinner. Okay. And what food? Marshmallows, maggots, crickets, maggots.
[11995.90s -> 12008.89s]  All right. It's live. We're going to get crickets and maggots. Crickets. Here we go. It's got,
[12008.89s -> 12021.21s]  I don't, I can't, it's gotta be crickets. Maggots, I'm not old enough. Okay. All right. All right.
[12024.28s -> 12033.43s]  New rod. Oh, what have we got? Creek Pro 8, the Omni Float, value spin, the Elemental 6-7.
[12038.34s -> 12055.08s]  Think so. 1700. Put it on. Where's my inventory? Okay. Glowing Peership Float. Where's my
[12060.28s -> 12074.94s]  Horn Warp? Where's the home storage? Okay. The Telefloat. Elemental. All right. Nice. Barbless
[12074.94s -> 12086.90s]  spinner. The rail must be equipped first. Is it not equipped? Oh, the rail on. Get that barbless
[12086.90s -> 12096.90s]  spinner on there. Line must be equipped. Oh, will you fuck off? 262. Got it. Line must be equipped.
[12096.90s -> 12109.02s]  I just did. Right there. 209. Backpack is full. What's happening here? What's going on? Please.
[12110.14s -> 12118.44s]  All right. I have it here. Backpack is full. How is my backpack full?
[12122.18s -> 12127.78s]  That's a slop spoon. I don't want the slop. Five of these? Why do I have five of these?
[12135.06s -> 12155.56s]  There we are. Terminal Tackle Weight. Let's go. Rocky Lake. One day past 2,000 bucks.
[12175.38s -> 12183.77s]  Colorado. That was it. This rod is probably cool though. Let's take a look. I only need like 100
[12183.77s -> 12193.22s]  bucks. Look at this beauty. This thing is a beauty. All right. What we got on here for bait.
[12194.02s -> 12199.59s]  That's all we know. We don't use bait. This is just this thing. I would love it. I would love
[12199.59s -> 12210.62s]  it if it just snapped and just broke. That's a nice rod. Nice new rod. That went very far. That
[12210.62s -> 12218.30s]  went across the whole lake. What does that mean? I need to keep it somewhere floating around like
[12218.30s -> 12253.72s]  Flappy Bird, right? I can't let it touch anything. Wait. Why is everybody saying minus two? Flappy Bird?
[12259.26s -> 12286.82s]  I didn't even know there was somebody on there. That's far. All right. Slow. Stop and go. What
[12286.82s -> 12297.80s]  does that mean? Stop and go. Oh, I think somebody's on it. Is that what that means?
[12299.54s -> 12316.28s]  Somebody's on it. Somebody's on it. Somebody's on this. I think this is a big one. Oh, that is
[12316.28s -> 12330.07s]  a big one. That's a spotted bass. $100 fine. Nice. That thing's... Okay. I've done this three times.
[12332.42s -> 12341.22s]  Am I going to be three for three and getting in trouble? Yeah. What is the percentage? That seems
[12341.22s -> 12358.94s]  like a really high percentage chance to get arrested for it. It's definitely more than one
[12358.94s -> 12421.51s]  out of three. It's probably like a 10% chance to get that. Is there anything on this? I can't believe
[12422.47s -> 12428.78s]  that Disney and Sony did not come to an agreement for Spider-Man. That's fucking unbelievable to me.
[12445.06s -> 12464.95s]  It's turning into a podcast. Big Whoop. 50th superhero in five years. Yeah, but the... Okay.
[12464.95s -> 12484.52s]  Those Spider-Man... What the fuck over here? Just Spider-Man. All right. 13 bucks. How much do I need?
[12488.15s -> 12496.71s]  Far From Home is my favorite Marvel movie. It just is. Homecoming was very, very, very good too. I
[12496.71s -> 12501.72s]  think the... I think the two Spider-Man movies in the MCU are the best. Out of the... All of them
[12502.28s -> 12519.96s]  combined. Homecoming sucked? What? Michael Keaton. Michael Keaton is in that movie. It's
[12519.96s -> 12525.16s]  automatically... It's like Michael Keaton being in a movie is the same way I feel about when a car is
[12525.16s -> 12531.90s]  drivable in a video game. It becomes a full letter grade hire. I am sorry. That is... I will... I will
[12531.90s -> 12549.18s]  take that all the way to the bank. Spider-Verse is better. If Spider-Verse is... I'm talking like
[12549.18s -> 12557.93s]  the Spider-Man MCU movies. Not... Into the Spider-Verse was great, but I'm talking live action
[12557.93s -> 12572.28s]  Spider-Man. There was somebody on that. Spider-Verse was Sony Pictures. Yeah, but that... The amazing
[12572.28s -> 12583.29s]  Spider-Man one and two was also Sony. And yeah, you go back to the the Sam Raimi movies. That was
[12583.29s -> 12609.00s]  Sam Raimi. That wasn't, you know, Sony. Easy, easy. Big one. All right. If Sam Raimi comes back and
[12609.00s -> 12615.40s]  does Spider-Man for the next Sony movie, maybe. We'll see. But that... That is not going to happen.
[12615.40s -> 12642.60s]  You all know it. What is this thing? Ooh. Illegal? This one's illegal as well. This would be four
[12642.60s -> 12680.25s]  for four. I'm... I'm losing money and I'm trying to gain a hundred, two hundred dollars. The article
[12680.25s -> 12683.45s]  said that the director and Tom Holland is still going to be doing the next two planned Spider-Man
[12683.45s -> 12702.79s]  films. They'll mess it up somehow. Not those two. You don't got all the other... You don't have all
[12702.79s -> 12708.02s]  the other production in the Marvel Studios teams. Takes more than a director and an actor to make a
[12708.02s -> 12731.51s]  movie. Is anybody on this? No. I want more Taskmaster. They have to explore more of these
[12731.51s -> 12757.45s]  interesting characters. Mysterio was just one of those insanely interesting characters that I...
[12757.45s -> 12772.42s]  I'm so happy that... At least that last one was Mysterio. It was fucking awesome. No, no, no, no,
[12772.42s -> 12795.64s]  no spoilers. If anybody says a spoiler, they're fucking gone. This is a great character. I loved
[12795.72s -> 12809.19s]  every second of that movie. Vulture... Vulture was... Michael Keaton, man. Like, God. I wanted...
[12809.19s -> 12813.75s]  Hear me out on this one. When I found out that Michael Keaton was going to be in a Spider-Man
[12813.75s -> 12820.71s]  movie, I shit my pants. I remember I was driving my car and I was just driving along and I was on
[12820.71s -> 12827.75s]  the radio. There's just an Michael Keaton is picked to be cast as a villain in a new Spider-Man
[12827.75s -> 12832.15s]  movie. And I was like, what the... And I just started... Yeah, there's nothing I could do about
[12832.15s -> 12838.60s]  it because I thought he was going to be Carnage. I'm just thinking, imagine Michael Keaton,
[12838.60s -> 12852.31s]  Beetlejuice, Carnage. Oh my God. I was so ready for that. Too bad. But he did a fantastic job as
[12852.31s -> 12875.43s]  Vulture. This is my number one podcast. Hey, welcome to the cast. Hey, guys. Let me be the first to
[12875.43s -> 12885.43s]  welcome you to my new series, the Comcast. As you see, we're using our fishing rod here.
[12888.65s -> 12899.21s]  Welcome to the Comcast. We talk about movies, TV shows while we fish. If you have anything,
[12899.21s -> 12902.49s]  any topic you want to talk about, anything that you got on your mind, throw it up there.
[12916.73s -> 12921.45s]  All right. No, no, no, no, no. Listen to me. This is important. You cannot do a minus two
[12921.45s -> 12930.76s]  and then an LUL after that. Doesn't that contradict that minus two? Don't correct me here.
[12930.76s -> 12954.04s]  I'm sorry. I don't think that matches up. Do I have enough money? Worse streamer on Twitch?
[12955.56s -> 12969.58s]  Worse streamer? Really? Worse than like the dickhead that streamed porn? Worse than that?
[12983.77s -> 12999.22s]  Yeah. How could you compare yourself? That stream was... I'm not even going to say it.
[12999.94s -> 13003.70s]  I am not going to take this because I get arrested every time I'm doing it.
[13003.70s -> 13031.77s]  Look at this. Yeah. How do I just end the day? I have an unlimited license here. End the day.
[13032.97s -> 13039.62s]  I need money. End the day. End the day. How do I end the day?
[13046.46s -> 13052.14s]  300 bucks is exactly where I was started with 20, 30 minutes ago. That's exactly where I was
[13052.94s -> 13060.94s]  30 minutes ago. God damn it. Just pay. I need to catch five fish. I'm not going
[13062.49s -> 13075.98s]  to keep any illegal fish. Promise. Sell old rods for cash. Sell old rods. Sell old rods.
[13076.62s -> 13095.58s]  What do we got? Sell old rods. I gotta go home for this. Okay. Inventory. Home. Ooh,
[13095.66s -> 13103.53s]  shit. Okay. Mini spin 800. Sell off a net. Yes, I do. Value spin 63. Done. All right. Let's go.
[13105.50s -> 13113.08s]  Rocky Lake. First time ever. We're getting there. Rocky Lake, Colorado. Travel for one day.
[13114.76s -> 13125.21s]  Got my license. Let's go. I'm not going to spend anything. Okay. We got what we got here.
[13126.09s -> 13130.09s]  Marshmallows. I have whisked crickets. All right. I'm going to get some bluegills.
[13130.89s -> 13137.99s]  Colorado golden trout is crickets as possible. Anything else? What about... I need crickets as a
[13137.99s -> 13144.87s]  much higher up on that list. Doe balls, crickets, crickets. I think we're going to go over here.
[13145.91s -> 13170.58s]  Golden Shiner. This looks like a good place to start. What do you guys think? Don't write.
[13170.58s -> 13182.01s]  Nobody write that. Okay. Now I've got my... Let's try it right here. Right off the rock. Look at
[13182.01s -> 13200.84s]  this beautiful mountain, rocky Colorado. Fabulous nano spinner. Stop and go. Stop and go. What are
[13200.84s -> 13205.16s]  your thoughts on the potential Disney theme Super Smash Brothers game? With the amount of
[13205.16s -> 13209.24s]  shit owned by Disney, you could have Tom Brady versus Darth Vader versus Donald Duck.
[13211.80s -> 13214.60s]  I mean, I've said from the very beginning that I think Scrooge McDuck would be a
[13214.60s -> 13220.14s]  perfect addition to Smash Brothers. That move set is already there. I can already see it.
[13220.78s -> 13226.02s]  The issue is, didn't Sakurai already say, that they have to have originated on a video game
[13226.02s -> 13233.29s]  console, right? But what a perfect addition that would be. And there it is. Bluegill.
[13233.93s -> 13251.02s]  Sorry, I'll keep it. Nintendo and Disney hate each other. Where do you get that from? Tom Brady's
[13251.02s -> 13261.13s]  special move is invoking Gronk, who spikes the enemy into the turf. I think at that point I
[13261.13s -> 13266.25s]  would probably quit video games. That would probably be time. I would probably look at that
[13266.25s -> 13270.97s]  and be like, I think I'm done with this. I don't think this is for me anymore.
[13271.77s -> 13293.69s]  The lines are getting tangled. This is kind of a big one. I'm gonna like choke this guy.
[13295.61s -> 13321.98s]  I just rip his head over. What is it? Whoa! All right, that's pretty good. Why do I think
[13321.98s -> 13327.29s]  this guy cares? I'm just automatically assuming that everybody here is in chat.
[13327.85s -> 13334.25s]  And look, look what I have. That's pretty good though. Oh, I do care. They say
[13335.54s -> 13364.52s]  127 bucks. Pretty good. Let's get another one. That was a big cast, I know. Jesus Christ,
[13364.52s -> 13371.80s]  fishing. I'm not sure if that's somebody coming in with a saying that, oh, I can't believe you're
[13371.80s -> 13389.42s]  doing this or like, this is cold to me. I'll take it. 20 bucks. Oh, narrow spoon, small minnows,
[13389.42s -> 13398.98s]  small cut bait. What's the biggest thing in this game? How do I get, I want to go on a boat.
[13399.70s -> 13415.86s]  Can I take out a loan? Jesus Christ, fishing. What? Hold on. Do you have a, you're doing two
[13415.86s -> 13419.54s]  at the same time? What happens if you, if you catch one on there, you have to drop the one
[13419.54s -> 13429.29s]  you're holding? Do people actually, do people multi-box fishing? I don't know if people did
[13429.29s -> 13446.02s]  this. How many of these can you reliably do? That's kind of big. Let's see. That's all right.
[13446.74s -> 13462.28s]  That's 0.28 pounds. Sorry. That's pretty good. Not bad. See, now I get to be the guy that has the
[13462.28s -> 13487.11s]  cool rod. Here we go. Another one. This is a good spot. Don't lose it. Another big one. I want, dude,
[13487.11s -> 13500.46s]  nothing can replace that like four pound fish that I caught. I think it was awesome. I took your name
[13500.46s -> 13507.02s]  and wow, catch one fish for me to get it back. See, that's where you've already played yourself,
[13507.02s -> 13511.58s]  unfortunately, because when was the last time you've ever seen me in a game, especially a
[13511.58s -> 13518.62s]  multiplayer game, where German985 was my name? It's going to be like fucking Harold26.
[13534.62s -> 13549.11s]  Do it quick. Take that one. Don't take that one. Don't take Harold26. That's my name. It's going to
[13549.11s -> 13560.90s]  be my wow name. He's going to be, doesn't matter. I'll find it. I'll find another one right at the
[13560.90s -> 13585.43s]  end. Got one. I just turned on like the developer console. Make your wow character for where they
[13585.43s -> 13599.66s]  take all the names. I don't care about like the name of the character. It's okay. Did I lose him?
[13599.66s -> 13617.42s]  I think I lost it. Oh, I was going to look. I want to see it. Nah, I'm doing this stupidly. Nah,
[13617.42s -> 13628.20s]  just get it back in here. Okay. These are all 30 to 50 bucks each. I feel like that's all I'm
[13628.20s -> 13635.50s]  getting over here though. I want to put on, why is it got a bunch of crickets? Different line?
[13636.30s -> 13648.50s]  Can I not put a, shit, I have to use this. I mean, I'm catching stuff all over the place, but
[13648.50s -> 13660.60s]  I want to put on that new bait. I took the hook off. This is the spinner rod, right? Am I going
[13660.60s -> 13665.46s]  to play Final Fantasy, the entirety of Final Fantasy? I'm not going to do that. I don't think
[13665.46s -> 13691.48s]  so. Sorry. Stop that. Did that in one stream. Is there ever been an RPG I have considered?
[13692.87s -> 13702.60s]  Uh, I guess I've technically played some RPGs on this stream. Not, I don't know. Have I ever done
[13702.60s -> 13711.13s]  a turn-based RPG on this stream? I don't think I have. No, I don't think so. I think all the
[13711.13s -> 13729.98s]  fish are gone here. I'm moving. I'm moving. I don't like this spot anymore. I'm going to go
[13729.98s -> 13738.23s]  down here. All right. So I've been playing Fishing Planet for four hours.
[13741.32s -> 13749.85s]  Now I'm just, this is just a, I'm liking this though, but okay. Trying to think about something
[13749.85s -> 13762.14s]  here. Hold on. Fishing Planet 2 incoming. I actually like this. I catch a big one. I did.
[13762.14s -> 13775.74s]  I got a huge one earlier. If you were here, you would have been like, what the fuck? All right.
[13776.46s -> 13807.42s]  I feel like this is a rubber band. What's going on here? Am I stuck on the weeds over here? Come
[13807.42s -> 13823.98s]  on. I would just swim over there and take it out. That's not that far away. That's right there.
[13829.78s -> 13855.45s]  What a dummy. I lost that. I lost that. That, that thing was expensive, wasn't it? Oh, fuck me.
[13856.25s -> 13861.64s]  That thing was like six or seven hundred dollars. All right. I'm, I need to go back to my house.
[13862.52s -> 13866.20s]  Is this not going to, is it going to be a whole day? How long does it take to go back to your
[13866.20s -> 13883.80s]  house? You can fly from Colorado to Texas back to Colorado in a day. Okay. I'm good. I just got
[13883.80s -> 13890.44s]  this wave of craving in my brain. It just happened to this a second ago right now. Stuffed crust
[13890.44s -> 13904.31s]  Pizza Hut pizza. It just, it just deposited into my head. All right. Um, where is it? I got it back
[13904.31s -> 13911.13s]  to my home here. Take this off. Tele-float. Item can't be replaced with only item of the same type.
[13912.97s -> 13924.55s]  Tele-float. And then I'm going to put on the hook. Reel must be equipped. Okay. Relax. Where's my reel?
[13925.11s -> 13946.14s]  Let me spin. This looks kind of cool. Too heavy. Break the line. Now I want crickets. Must be
[13946.14s -> 13952.44s]  gripped first. All right. Tackle's too heavy and we'll break the line. What will break the line?
[13953.08s -> 13961.34s]  This is going to break the line? Two pounds. Here. Put this one on. There. You all right?
[13962.14s -> 13993.06s]  Crickets. Here we go. It's not sponsored. Sponsored. This game came out three years ago.
[13993.94s -> 14018.89s]  All right. I'm back guys. This time I got crickets. Looking for a different fish. I have, yeah. I've
[14018.89s -> 14031.78s]  gone fishing before. Plenty of times. It's an interesting thing for a minute. I get bored
[14031.78s -> 14042.34s]  really easily though. Here we go. First catch with the crickets. Ooh, this is new. What is this one?
[14044.86s -> 14074.09s]  Ooh, black crabby. You're out of current bait. I only bought one cricket. You buy one cricket.
[14086.09s -> 14097.62s]  What the fuck is going on? They're right here. What? 98. How do I put them into my backpack?
[14103.06s -> 14108.98s]  Why will they not go to my backpack? Why am I putting one? I'm putting on. I'm baiting one
[14108.98s -> 14116.92s]  cricket onto my pole and then putting that in a backpack and then going, like getting on a plane.
[14116.92s -> 14121.32s]  Getting out of the plane. Taking the tackle out of my checked bag and everything. Doing that and
[14121.32s -> 14125.72s]  then leaving. Why would I do this? How can I not put this over here? I need, how do I bring more
[14125.80s -> 14146.30s]  than one? Bait. Cricket. Put it over there. Oh my god, you said to do that. Really? Oh, that stinks.
[14150.26s -> 14160.42s]  Well, whatever. Let's, I still have a day pass. It's $2,000 to do that. Did I seriously spend
[14160.42s -> 14198.89s]  $2,000? Did I spend $2,000 to go there and come back? Anybody here like crickets? Crickets. What
[14198.89s -> 14211.18s]  is a crankbait? Blood worm. Of course not. Nobody. Crickets. Nobody. What about the other side?
[14211.82s -> 14233.99s]  Well, that was Fishing Planet. Fun little game. Free. As you can tell, it's interesting,
[14233.99s -> 14239.16s]  roguelike. You can run out of money and you have to, you know, go back and try it again and start
[14239.16s -> 14247.24s]  kind of from the beginning. They'll hate crickets. They will. A cricket and a grasshopper are the same
[14248.34s -> 14258.76s]  bug. A cricket and a grasshopper. God just randomized the role between the two of them.
[14259.08s -> 14262.52s]  It was just like that you made a grasshopper and then you did the random button like 10 times.
[14263.24s -> 14281.74s]  They're the same fucking thing. One chirps like a bird. Big deal. That's like saying blue cheese
[14281.74s -> 14287.96s]  sauce is the same as blue cheese dressing. I fucked up, okay? I'm sorry, I fucked up.
[14287.96s -> 14300.62s]  FortniteJimmy is joining us again. That's a, I'm actually happy about that. Jimmy's back. I am
[14300.62s -> 14336.71s]  really excited about this. I can't wait to see what FortniteJimmy asks. Hi. Um, I can't.
[14338.46s -> 14367.14s]  Can I tell you guys something? I, I love this stream. This is like one of my favorite streams
[14367.14s -> 14381.53s]  in the last like two months. I am, I am very happy right now. Can I just tell you? I think for me,
[14381.53s -> 14388.33s]  best stream, like favorite best streams of all time. Sims 4 mod murder house. Fishing planet.
[14388.33s -> 14417.27s]  Close second. Nobody wants crickets. That's okay. Fishing is just outdoor gambling. It's really
[14417.27s -> 14422.47s]  strange that I know exactly what you're talking about. That's funny. That's weird. Yeah, it is.
[14423.19s -> 14568.42s]  Yeah, that's fair. They don't eat cheese either. You only get one? What's that even mean? Yeah,
[14568.42s -> 14572.26s]  I'm busy, but like I only get one though. But I'm here. I'm available for questions.
[14573.30s -> 14605.13s]  This is turning into a dad stream. I was going to take the cheese off. This isn't working.
[14622.84s -> 14627.56s]  Guys, this is not, this is not like a, like a 10 year old. All right. This is, I'm being
[14627.56s -> 14632.12s]  trolled right now. Why am I like, I'm like getting in my own head like, wait a minute.
[14632.68s -> 14636.92s]  I better like be, tell this person like, hey, it's like fun. Like just, I'm trying to like backtrack.
[14647.43s -> 14652.79s]  I'm like getting in my own. Wait a minute. Hold on, dude. Is this like, this person's following me
[14652.79s -> 14663.61s]  into service and talking about free Fortnite skins. This person's not real. I can't, you can't type
[14663.61s -> 14680.30s]  like that. And I couldn't type like that at nine. Yeah. This, yeah. That's okay.
[14680.94s -> 14694.17s]  Hey, you want to know how to respond to any, like any, doesn't matter what it is.
[14700.09s -> 14707.34s]  Damn. Damn. No, it's a kid. I can't, this is not even, this is a, this is somebody,
[14707.34s -> 14715.85s]  this person's like 30. I'm fighting it. It's like, it's, it's faking me out. I'm fighting it.
[14715.85s -> 14777.50s]  I didn't, this is a troll. I'm being, I didn't just leave them. I'm being
[14777.50s -> 14780.94s]  fucked with right now. You guys have been, you guys have fallen for it.
[14785.19s -> 14790.57s]  You can never go back there. I can't go back there.
[14790.57s -> 14806.89s]  I didn't, I didn't answer any questions. I can't go back. I can't go back in there.
[14807.53s -> 14818.68s]  Okay. I'm going back. I'm coming. Okay. I'm back. Everybody can settle down. I got a good cover.
[14852.10s -> 14900.81s]  Okay. The internet cafe. I'm being trolled. He got lost in the realm.
[14901.77s -> 14924.79s]  He went to go pick up some herbs. Why did I leave them? How could I have done that?
[14924.79s -> 15109.98s]  I'll be right back. I'm going to go get a water. I keep laughing. I can't stop. I keep laughing at
[15109.98s -> 15118.06s]  just like the mom's MacBook, like overheating. And I just keep seeing this image in my head.
[15118.06s -> 15123.66s]  It is like the mom's MacBook overheated and like did it auto, like Intel shut down the computer,
[15123.66s -> 15132.14s]  you know, Intel has that shit. And I just see him standing there still for two minutes before
[15132.14s -> 15137.43s]  he just because he's gone, but he doesn't get disconnected yet. And he's just standing there
[15137.43s -> 15140.79s]  lost somewhere. And he just gets fucking disconnected. And it takes two minutes for
[15140.79s -> 15192.94s]  his portrait to disappear. I can't, I can't even, I can't even play this anymore. I can't play this
[15192.94s -> 15199.98s]  game right now. It's all, it's ruined. It's ruined for me. I can't play it.
[15223.90s -> 15226.06s]  Fortnite Jimmy 2010.
[15247.37s -> 15251.37s]  All right. I'm sorry, but if somebody comes into a fish game and asks me how to get Fortnite skins,
[15251.37s -> 15255.21s]  I'm going to automatically assume that that person is a viewer just trying to get
[15255.29s -> 15279.70s]  like onto my skin. Jimmy, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Jimmy, if you're watching. You're the only streamer
[15279.70s -> 15286.97s]  that's played this long enough to become a villain. You don't become a villain in a fishing game. I
[15286.97s -> 15295.03s]  just, I didn't do anything. I, all I said, I said, hey, I'm ready to answer questions. I'm busy.
[15295.03s -> 15300.58s]  But like, you know, I'll give one question for every, any person in the server. I'm not the bad
[15300.58s -> 15310.42s]  guy. I was answering questions. Then you left. Yeah. I said, I was like, Hey, good luck, man. I
[15310.42s -> 15325.45s]  got to go. Like what you got? I'm not allowed to leave a game. I can't leave. Uh, if I lacked
[15325.45s -> 15346.26s]  your lich gave $50. Jerma bullied Jimmy. He was just a kid, Jerma. You left him in the realm
[15346.26s -> 15368.84s]  where there were no fish to fish, no walls to wall run. I have to. Oh, God damn. This shit is
[15368.84s -> 15387.13s]  fucking ridiculous. Nice cast. I'm with Jimmy right now. What do you want me to say? Tell him
[15387.21s -> 15394.18s]  I'll answer any question. I got extra time. I got extra time on my internet cafe card
[15395.18s -> 15414.47s]  and I'm around. Now we can't just go back to fishing after this. Can we? I think maybe,
[15414.47s -> 15420.18s]  maybe if I'd like just go back to normal, I just need to go back to normal and get the cheese off.
[15420.18s -> 15427.34s]  I'm going to put some pet food on here. I'm going to go back to normal. I didn't do anything wrong.
[15428.63s -> 15460.10s]  I didn't do anything. I'm fishing. That's what a villain would do. He sent you a friend request.
[15462.92s -> 15467.56s]  Did he? Hold on. Wait a minute. Did Jimmy send me a friend request?
[15476.33s -> 15482.89s]  This is too many Fortnite characters. Too many Fortnite characters. All right. I'll take them
[15482.89s -> 15517.77s]  both. Are you happy? I'll take Kyle 2007 and I'll take Jimmy 2010. Sure. I'm going. Wait,
[15517.77s -> 15543.53s]  this is his whole profile. 2020, 2019. How do I leave this screen? Can I take his stuff?
[15544.94s -> 15558.54s]  What? No, I'm not trying to take his stuff. I can't leave the screen. There we go. All right.
[15558.54s -> 15562.46s]  We're going to, we're going, I'm going to go, I'm going to go, I'm going to go, I'm going to go to
[15562.46s -> 15570.84s]  Jimmy and I'm going to say I'm sorry. Smotherim just gave $50. Thank you for the 50 bucks. They
[15570.84s -> 15600.60s]  say local streamer annihilates poor Fortnite kid in fishing game. No, I'm going. How do I join?
[15600.60s -> 15615.96s]  How do I join this game? All right. The fishery. I can just do it, right? I don't have $120. How
[15615.96s -> 15629.85s]  is it possible? Sell something. Sell one of these. $8. That's nothing. What? How much money?
[15629.85s -> 15633.69s]  I got it. I have enough money. All right. Quick, quick, quick. I have to save. I have to go say
[15633.69s -> 15709.54s]  what's up. I have $120. Okay. I think I'm in this one, right? What the heck? Where is he? Jimmy,
[15718.02s -> 15728.90s]  he's stuck in the realm somewhere. Is he in another room? That's the one. Let's go.
[15736.81s -> 15850.97s]  En1. The room is full. Why am I fucking 15 feet tall? Jimmy. He's lost in the realm.
[15853.54s -> 15877.06s]  Somebody left? No, there's nobody in this one. This is a new room. I feel like I just got to the
[15877.06s -> 15883.64s]  end of an RPG dead end. Wrong room, Jim. Find Jimmy before it's too late. Oh, fuck. I gotta
[15883.64s -> 15924.01s]  turn around. Shit. Whatever. Oh shit. Five minutes left on the internet card. I don't have much time.
[15924.01s -> 15930.25s]  No, I can't just... I can't just like go PM. No, I've got to like just... Hey, I got five minutes
[15930.25s -> 15937.35s]  left on my internet card. Just checking the rooms. Just checking the realms and see what's
[15937.35s -> 16008.76s]  happening in each one. What do you mean PM? No. What? Come on. What? He went into a different room.
[16011.46s -> 16110.14s]  He went into another realm. Okay, we'll go. I'm fine. Yeah, I think people are weird. Don't worry
[16110.14s -> 16167.58s]  about that. Damn it. The fucking coffee pasta. I can't. I've done. I just want to say hi.
[16173.64s -> 16177.16s]  I don't know because people have... I don't know. Some people are fucking nice.
[16178.18s -> 16192.06s]  Why is... That's very easy. I gotta like... I don't know. I'm just nice to everybody. I think
[16192.86s -> 16211.48s]  being... I'm just nice to everybody. I don't think... I think I just try to be nice. I just try. I just
[16213.75s -> 16221.51s]  try to be nice to everybody. Yeah. That's it. That's it. Because that's true. That's just true.
[16221.51s -> 16225.43s]  I don't matter. I just try to be nice to everybody. That's just... That's a true statement.
[16228.06s -> 16236.18s]  All right. I've closed the book. I've closed it. Oh, my internet cafe card.
[16236.82s -> 16269.74s]  Jimmy. I'm just a huge fan of Fortnite. It's a little rude, I think.
[16272.92s -> 16279.66s]  I talked to them earlier. I did, which I did. I did. That's true. I talked to them earlier.
[16279.66s -> 16282.86s]  Remember we were talking about like, oh, look at my fish and look at your fish. What's the contest?
[16291.64s -> 16297.64s]  All right. It's been fun, Jimmy, but I've got to go. Okay. Yes. Okay. Everything's fine. We're all
[16297.64s -> 16302.42s]  done. You're a nice guy. Thank you. Hey, thanks. It was... It's been a pleasure. My internet
[16302.42s -> 16336.34s]  fucking cafe time is up. The ding went off. Okay. I... Get out. I don't want... This is... I don't...
[16336.34s -> 16341.30s]  I'm gone. I didn't... I'm... That's it. I just said, I have a great time in the game. It was
[16341.30s -> 16379.06s]  fun. It was nice to meet you. Have a good day. Goodbye. I just want to fish. I can't block them.
[16379.70s -> 16383.99s]  All right. That was... That was interesting. Okay. Let's go back to playing the game.
[16391.06s -> 16395.46s]  That was... That was... You know what? Yeah, that's right. That was two grown adult men.
[16396.34s -> 16409.96s]  How much? I have zero dollars? Oh my god. He knows you're online. Yeah, but I'm just... That could
[16409.96s -> 16426.33s]  be any... That could be online, but not... In fact, you spent all your money stalking this person.
[16426.33s -> 16436.33s]  No, I'm just trying to... My internet... My internet card's up. All right. That's it. Thank you. If I
[16436.33s -> 16446.49s]  liked your glitch for the $50, you better hope to have Google Fiber in prison. Why? What are you
[16446.49s -> 16464.94s]  talking about? What does that mean? Look, I just want to fish. I just want... I just want to fish.
[16464.94s -> 16470.25s]  I want to fish. I'm just gonna... I'm going to the basic fishing zone. I'm gonna fish.
[16520.81s -> 16619.94s]  Can I do this? Let me see. It's 160 coins to change your fucking name? What? This is why I
[16619.94s -> 16627.94s]  don't enter in-game chats. I never do either. And I was pressured to answer questions from the chat
[16627.94s -> 16651.43s]  room. This one. This is an in-game chat right here. Fortnite Jeremy. You have to quit streaming.
[16651.43s -> 16739.86s]  Did I just... Wait, did I just PM him? Why did somebody write that? Uninstall the game.
[16748.04s -> 16813.48s]  Ugh. I'm staying. Terrible. What a shitty internet cafe. I'm fucking crying. Fishing planet.
[16815.88s -> 16824.38s]  Why would you pay to do this? Good to see you. Bye. Yeah, it's my turn on the VC. We got a lot of
[16824.38s -> 16845.96s]  them. I just love Fishing Planet. You just left your coat and leave all your stuff. You play Fishing
[16845.96s -> 16851.51s]  Planet for like six hours at an internet cafe and you leave all your stuff on a chair? Where were
[16851.51s -> 16877.48s]  you going? It's staying logged in. Yeah, you're still logged in as you... No, it's an internet
[16877.48s -> 16895.83s]  cafe. They have like the internet cafe account. God, that's fucking ridiculous. My fucking head
[16895.83s -> 16915.53s]  hurts. That was fucking... That was unreal. I'm gonna do put some bread on now. What the hell's
[16915.53s -> 16940.46s]  going on? How's Cox? Cox is doing actually pretty good ever since they fixed it. Flying pixels,
[16940.46s -> 16953.34s]  thanks for the five community subs. Thank you. What did they do? Their service is just awful,
[16953.90s -> 16968.12s]  unfortunately. I went away for three hours and the stream looks exactly the way it did.
[16970.09s -> 16991.62s]  Yeah, because not much has changed. Did I get anything? Did you ever wake that guy up?
[16991.70s -> 16998.58s]  Oh shit. Lewis Cheese, it's time for you to wake up. Lewis Cheese,
[17000.54s -> 17006.23s]  wake up. I hope you didn't miss your appointment because this is three and a half hours late.
[17012.50s -> 17026.55s]  I did it already. You can change your reeling speed. Oh yeah, I know. You can do slow. You can
[17026.55s -> 17051.40s]  be fast. Come on. Let me catch one fish for the first time in an hour. There it is. Got it. Another
[17051.40s -> 17070.52s]  thousand pings for Lewis. Oh god, my head is fucking killing me.
[17094.33s -> 17100.81s]  This is worse than the Labo streams and the Birdhouse streams. Somehow I disagree. I'm not
[17100.81s -> 17127.67s]  sure why. This is cozy. This has been a cozy stream. I'll be live tomorrow too. Tomorrow we're
[17127.67s -> 17151.43s]  probably gonna play Maximum Action. I missed it? What? Yeah, it is a constant conflict game. You're
[17151.43s -> 17179.38s]  right. How long is Maximum Action? Is it more than two or three hours? Or is it a quick game?
[17179.38s -> 17200.98s]  It's long, right? Long enough. I could probably do a whole stream on it, right? What's the best
[17200.98s -> 17207.03s]  fish I've ever eaten? A piece of king salmon from an Italian restaurant in Boston. And I don't
[17207.03s -> 17228.15s]  remember the name of the restaurant because I'm stupid. That is true. Yeah, I wish I remembered.
[17228.15s -> 17232.79s]  It was one of those scenarios where I was with my family and it was like, oh, let's go out to this
[17232.79s -> 17241.82s]  place and just kind of blend it together with everything else. The thing is, though, a lot of
[17241.82s -> 17247.93s]  those, a lot of Boston restaurants, especially the, they can have not only very similar menus,
[17249.78s -> 17256.42s]  but there's a ton, especially in the north end. There are so many Italian restaurants that it's
[17256.42s -> 17285.26s]  this, this probably hundreds of them. Oh, who is that in the distance? Well, somebody on the server?
[17290.95s -> 17309.40s]  Look to your left. This fishing man 62. He's just playing the game. Oh, I'm keeping it.
[17318.71s -> 17326.73s]  That, that, that crept up so fast. I couldn't stop it. Oh, yeah. I wish I knew this menu.
[17326.73s -> 17352.47s]  Why did I not know that there was a Metal Gear Solid menu? Pet food. Who uses cheese to fish?
[17352.47s -> 17369.83s]  A lot of people. It's used a lot. Talk to fishing. No, I'm no longer speaking in this chat. I'm just
[17369.91s -> 17385.72s]  guy playing video game. Is it the game's feeling eerie? That's because it's covered in smoke.
[17385.72s -> 17392.12s]  There's like a whole fog over everything. That's just like, that's just scary. It's scary. That is
[17392.12s -> 17408.57s]  a scary trope. This is illegal. I'm going to release it. I'm not getting in trouble. I don't
[17408.57s -> 17432.76s]  have any money. Why do I have so much? I have 198 pieces of cheese. Why do I have all this? This is
[17432.76s -> 17445.90s]  too many. Can I sell it? Can I get market value for this? Another illegal fish. Don't think so.
[17469.13s -> 17475.13s]  He's here. He's here. You know how many versions of Fortnite Jimmy I've seen in this chat? There's
[17475.13s -> 17512.42s]  like four of them. Five hours. What am I going to eat for food after this? Please press T. All right,
[17512.42s -> 17530.49s]  let me try that. It's been 5 a.m. the whole stream. 2 p.m.? Am I going to do this? What about all the
[17530.57s -> 17559.54s]  people in here? I guess I just can control time. This actually looks really nice. It's client
[17559.54s -> 17614.73s]  side. Idiot. No! What? Hey, what? No, no, no. No, no, no. Why am I being? Oh, no. Why is it doing this?
[17614.73s -> 17619.96s]  Say you're sorry. You don't know the controls. No, that's assumed. That's assumed. I'm like the
[17619.96s -> 17633.75s]  third person at this point. Can I get a manager? I don't understand. I'm trying to talk to people
[17633.75s -> 17643.62s]  and I'm just PMing this random Fortnite person. Oh, no. What the fuck have I done? What the fuck?
[17643.62s -> 17681.34s]  Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Wrong message. Sorry. Easy. Easy. Easy. That's like very simple. Easy.
[17681.34s -> 17699.86s]  How do I get out of this? No, no, no, no, no. No. No, I just was like, I was wrong. That would make
[17699.86s -> 17715.62s]  no sense. What did I just take? Not like, oh, sorry. Like, that was my wrong message. I was
[17715.62s -> 17719.30s]  sending it. Like, oh, sorry. Is it? Sorry. Out with everybody. That's the wrong message very clearly.
[17724.71s -> 17739.67s]  I'm just nice to everybody. Why do I have to message Jimmy again? I was trying to prove
[17739.67s -> 17746.76s]  somebody wrong in chat and they were right. But, uh, German sucks. Thanks for the five community subs.
[17748.68s -> 17763.37s]  Thank you. No, it's not the same person. It's not the same person. Like, oh, I was the wrong
[17763.37s -> 17767.29s]  message. I'm just another person at the internet cafe. I'm just another person. Don't you guys
[17767.29s -> 17841.34s]  understand? Like, I don't know who that person is. Asking for bits. Why did I have to fucking type?
[17841.34s -> 17848.25s]  I said, didn't I specifically say I'm not writing in an in-game chat ever again? And look what
[17848.25s -> 17898.02s]  the fucking happened. Look at what happened. I messaged the Fortnite troll person. He's in
[17898.02s -> 17904.39s]  chat right now. Well, then he'll know that I'm streaming from an internet cafe. It's really
[17904.39s -> 17921.22s]  loud in here. Fucking really, really loud in here. Hey, sorry. I'm sharing a space with
[17921.86s -> 17925.30s]  like two or three different, like three people that way and like five people that way. There's
[17925.30s -> 17944.68s]  like another 20 people in the other offices down here. I'm looking back. All these computers are
[17944.68s -> 17968.38s]  doing a good, they're all playing, we're all playing the same game. Hey, easy. Quit dropping
[17968.38s -> 17971.98s]  glasses back there. We all have to share this space, you fucking asshole.
[18031.50s -> 18036.06s]  Hey, hey, easy. It's just a game, man. You don't get to smash the computer.
[18038.94s -> 18042.30s]  We all lose them sometimes. You can't catch the big one every time.
[18049.10s -> 18049.60s]  Thanks.
[18077.50s -> 18088.98s]  Thanks for watching, Jimmy. You can see my time is almost up. My time's up now? All right.
[18088.98s -> 18115.99s]  Oh wait, sorry, I forgot. There's still people here. There's still people here.
[18116.63s -> 18125.85s]  I'm sorry.
[18144.18s -> 18169.03s]  Excuse me. Excuse me. Could I get another 25 minute card, please? Yeah, here, over here.
[18169.03s -> 18178.84s]  Meet number 42. That's not, that's, that's, I don't know why you played flute at me. I guess
[18178.84s -> 18186.68s]  that's a sign of a place when you call the person over to come over and ring you up.
[18188.60s -> 18208.95s]  Okay, so I'm over here. I'm over here. Please come over to me.
[18216.15s -> 18223.67s]  Thank you. I'm over here. My God, I need, how many? Yeah, thank you. Yes. Yeah, I got, I've,
[18223.67s -> 18232.65s]  it's a visa. I'll take one 20 minute. Yeah, I want a 20 minute. Thanks. Actually,
[18232.65s -> 18236.25s]  it's a, I want, give me two of those. Yeah, just keep going.
[18239.13s -> 18250.68s]  Yeah, maybe grab a 45 minute too. Yep. Another one. Thank you. Thank you. I'll take, that's my,
[18250.68s -> 18269.11s]  my card. Let me scratch off the back. Oh, good. This is, this is a 20 minute one. Yeah,
[18269.11s -> 18300.60s]  this is what I asked for. Let me just punch the code in real quick. Thank you. Fortnite Jimmy's
[18300.60s -> 18308.65s]  dad gave $50. Are you the guy that's harassing my son? Stop playing in that cafe. Oh God,
[18308.65s -> 18316.09s]  get out of here. Well, I hate to tell you, Fortnite Jimmy's dad, you could, you didn't have to give me
[18316.17s -> 18322.79s]  $50 to say that. Screw, you could have read the, the, the info down there. It was 250 for me to
[18322.79s -> 18356.41s]  read that. Okay. I need to relax. I'm going to fucking die. I'm going to pee my pants.
[18374.70s -> 18395.80s]  All right. Really? How many, how many fish do I have? Did you lose 600 viewers for that joke?
[18397.82s -> 18406.17s]  I don't know. Probably something like that.
[18411.19s -> 18421.78s]  They thought the stream was over. That's true. You know, it probably is. I'm going to be
[18421.78s -> 18435.43s]  real. It's probably, it probably is. Fortnite Jimmy's dad, another $50, a hundred dollars.
[18435.43s -> 18441.38s]  Fortnite Jimmy's dad. I know you heard my car streamer consequences will never be the same.
[18442.02s -> 18468.60s]  That's a mean thing. Thank you for the a hundred bucks though. For real. I've been making a lot
[18468.60s -> 18490.68s]  of fucking old man noises. Caught any big ones. I did. I need to get some bait. Man, you guys are
[18490.68s -> 18498.55s]  fucking hilarious. That happens sometimes. Sometimes a stream will happen where some of
[18498.55s -> 18502.87s]  the shit that you guys are doing and saying is it just, it just does it to me and it fucking throws
[18502.87s -> 18509.59s]  me off. And you guys are hilarious. Like seriously, I just, yeah, I aged like 30 years in the last 10
[18509.59s -> 18527.18s]  minutes. I think this is going to be the end of the fishing trip though. I actually laughed myself
[18527.18s -> 18536.78s]  into a migraine. I have a headache now, like a bad one. There's too much stim, like too much
[18536.78s -> 18554.28s]  stimulation in my brain. Oh, but yeah. I will see you guys tomorrow. Thanks for joining me.
[18554.28s -> 18559.86s]  This stream really, yeah, that, that's, how do you go from here, right? It's been over five hours.
[18559.86s -> 18562.66s]  I'm gonna do the bits. It'll probably be about five or six hours. That's, that's, that's good.
[18563.22s -> 18579.82s]  I'll be live tomorrow. My goodness. I will see you guys tomorrow for Maximum Action Fishing Planet.
[18579.82s -> 18588.31s]  It's a fun, yeah, it's a fun game. It's a solid 6.7. It's, it's fun. It's just, come on. You can
[18588.31s -> 18609.66s]  sit here and relax and pretend to be at an internet cafe. Hey, special thanks to Fortnite,
[18609.66s -> 18618.84s]  Jimmy. Hope you have a wonderful rest of your in-game time. My time is up right here. I will
[18618.84s -> 18629.40s]  actually for real see you tomorrow. Stick around for the bits if you want to. Maximum Action tomorrow
[18629.40s -> 18646.52s]  same time, probably around like three-ish p.m., three to four. As always, see you soon. Thank you
[18646.52s -> 18653.56s]  for watching. We are going to go back to a little bit earlier. We had 250 from Gnarly.
[18654.44s -> 18660.46s]  So when are you going to come visit? I'm available this Friday if you want to come over for lunch.
[18661.10s -> 18676.57s]  Uh, for lunch? Sure, yeah, then there's another one from Gnarly. Also, by the way, very excited
[18676.57s -> 18680.09s]  for the carnival stream. Thanks for working so hard putting it together. I hope I can watch it live.
[18680.65s -> 18684.89s]  I hope you can too. I hope as many people can, that's why I just, like I said, September 21st,
[18685.93s -> 18690.89s]  trying to get as much time for people to realize if they can go or if they want to participate or
[18691.53s -> 18694.89s]  they're going to be around for it. It's, I believe that's Saturday or Sunday 21st.
[18699.56s -> 18709.80s]  Should be a lot of fun, a lot of time, a lot of work is going into it. So I'm as excited as you
[18709.80s -> 18716.14s]  for real. Thank you Gnarly for the five dollars. Appreciate it. Uh, Shalashka, thanks for the 250.
[18716.14s -> 18722.38s]  You're an actor. Do you have any tips on memorizing something in your own way? The easiest way to
[18722.38s -> 18729.32s]  memorize lines is to have somebody else do them with you because instead of just staring at a
[18729.32s -> 18737.80s]  paper, you take the paper away and they have the paper and can correct you. It's much more fluid,
[18737.80s -> 18742.28s]  it's much more, it's much easier to memorize something when you're not the one staring at
[18742.28s -> 18760.60s]  the paper. Then they steal your part. That's not how it works. What is the carnival stream? The
[18760.60s -> 18770.04s]  carnival stream is going to be a twitch controlled stream. There are going to be a series of large
[18770.04s -> 18775.08s]  robots who chat is going to control to play carnival midway games throughout the day.
[18775.96s -> 18797.03s]  On the 21st of September, mark it on your calendar. Should be a lot of fun. Can we physically be at
[18797.03s -> 18804.23s]  the carnival? No. No. There's going to be, I thought about like, oh maybe have people there.
[18805.67s -> 18810.31s]  When you have something like that with, I'm not saying that anything here is going to be dangerous,
[18810.31s -> 18817.99s]  but legally and liability speaking, I don't want anybody that's not part of this production
[18817.99s -> 18826.28s]  to be on this set with machines that are able to, with big machines, you know what I'm saying? I
[18826.28s -> 18830.92s]  don't want anyone to have any, that's just not something I want to do. Is it going to be free?
[18830.92s -> 18844.20s]  Absolutely. It has nothing to do with how dangerous the machines are, but the functions of the
[18844.28s -> 18849.74s]  machines. You know, if somebody somehow touches one of them or, because they're going to be
[18849.74s -> 18854.78s]  engineers here, that they're responsible for them. I would never want a scenario where somebody,
[18855.50s -> 18860.30s]  I don't know, think about any scenario where somebody would touch it or fall onto it or
[18860.30s -> 18864.14s]  trip or grab it or try to take a picture with it or something. You know, I just, you got to be
[18864.14s -> 18873.34s]  careful and I don't want any of those scenarios to ever be a possibility. How are you controlling
[18873.34s -> 18893.21s]  the machines in chat? Good luck. What does it take to get word out that said twitch controlled
[18893.21s -> 18902.30s]  stream is going to take place? Well, I've been talking to Twitch and they seemed
[18902.30s -> 18914.94s]  seemingly somewhat preliminarily interested in maybe, they're not working on it or anything,
[18914.94s -> 18919.10s]  but I went back and forth a couple times with some of the people there to see if they, if
[18919.10s -> 18921.74s]  anything wanted to happen from it or if they wanted to do something with it or,
[18922.30s -> 18932.68s]  but nobody at Twitch is like working on this project at all. Yeah, something like maybe grab
[18932.68s -> 18937.24s]  a front page slot or something possibly, maybe I'm going to see if it's available. That's another
[18937.24s -> 18943.32s]  thing. I don't know. We'll see. I can't say that anything like that will or will not happen,
[18944.20s -> 18961.77s]  but it might be interesting if it is. How many viewers is it going to get? I have no idea.
[18962.81s -> 18970.71s]  That's something that I cannot give you a prediction of. I would say, yeah, I would say
[18970.71s -> 18985.96s]  at least four. Hey, deep fried Gundam. Thanks for the 250. They say been stressed out about
[18985.96s -> 18990.60s]  my future due to recently graduating college, but your streams always help me relax and
[18990.60s -> 18995.00s]  to not lose my shit. Love you, Jermbo, despite your garbage cheese takes.
[18996.28s -> 18999.72s]  Garbage cheese takes. I just wish cheese I think is the best. That's what they're referring to.
[19001.24s -> 19007.26s]  But no, any time, graduating college is a huge change because it's one of the first times in
[19007.26s -> 19015.70s]  your life where you're not sort of in schooling for the most part. Most people that go to college,
[19015.70s -> 19019.70s]  you know, you typically do K through 12 and then maybe you take a year maybe,
[19019.70s -> 19028.79s]  or maybe you go right into college and it's a huge change. So it is like a big turning point
[19028.79s -> 19044.01s]  in a lot of people's lives, right? I mean, when I graduated college, it was, it was kind of scary.
[19044.01s -> 19053.53s]  It was because you just, you've never known that before. So, okay, it's time to do something.
[19054.33s -> 19060.25s]  And what that is, I don't know. You look around for jobs, you try to find something that you're
[19060.25s -> 19063.77s]  good at or that you think is interesting, that you really care about at least a handful of things.
[19064.57s -> 19078.36s]  But hopefully over time and over, you know, months, years, whatever it takes,
[19079.32s -> 19081.24s]  try to get something going, try to do something.
[19083.16s -> 19098.54s]  People usually fall into something somehow. What did I do after college? After college,
[19099.66s -> 19107.59s]  I kind of went right into, I'm going to do video stuff. And that's where the wedding video stuff
[19107.59s -> 19115.35s]  came from. I just was a freelance video maker. And oh, you, you're a friend. I know a friend
[19115.35s -> 19121.83s]  that's getting married. Hey, I'll do your wedding. I can do that. And then that person told a friend
[19121.83s -> 19126.55s]  who was getting married and that person told a friend and I kind of worked off of just complete
[19126.55s -> 19139.02s]  word of mouth and that was it. I did not have a professional setup. I had a really nice camera
[19139.02s -> 19142.30s]  and obviously I had, I thought the skill is necessary to be able to cut stuff like that
[19142.30s -> 19147.82s]  up together and people thought they were good. I got a lot of good comments of, hey, that was
[19147.82s -> 19150.94s]  really well put together. Thank you. We, we loved it, you know, whatever. And you just
[19150.94s -> 19154.06s]  work off of that. That's kind of what I did for at least a couple of years.
[19159.27s -> 19165.83s]  And I also substitute taught. I was like a substitute teacher. I did teacher's aid stuff.
[19173.43s -> 19186.20s]  Teacher noise. Yeah. I was, I was kind of all over the place until I really started to put,
[19187.32s -> 19191.08s]  because when I started that YouTube channel, it was just, I just did it because I thought it was
[19191.08s -> 19206.33s]  fun. That was it. I didn't really have very many expectations on it. And that's kind of how I've
[19206.33s -> 19213.30s]  kind of fallen into this is just kind of just keep going. It just worked out. If I did not,
[19213.30s -> 19217.86s]  if I was not a streamer or a YouTuber or anything, if I wasn't doing this and putting all the time
[19217.86s -> 19226.73s]  into it, I probably would have continued to do, I probably would have gone into education. I
[19226.73s -> 19231.85s]  probably would have. And I know like that, I know, hold on, you would be a teacher.
[19233.03s -> 19237.35s]  I don't know. I think about that. I really like computers. I really like games. I really like
[19238.15s -> 19254.62s]  talking to people. It would be some, I would find something to do even being in just in a,
[19254.62s -> 19264.44s]  like a school system or something. Right. I probably would have fallen into that somehow
[19272.79s -> 19276.87s]  or customer service because I remember we talked about the fishing trip. I just,
[19277.19s -> 19290.28s]  I just talk. But thank you Tingy for the 250. Since you're talking about streaming stats,
[19291.00s -> 19294.28s]  I want to bring to your attention that you are no longer a top 1000 streamer.
[19295.16s -> 19304.49s]  What do you mean? You are a top 500 streamer. What are you talking about? Top 500?
[19311.93s -> 19335.37s]  Twitchmetrics.net. That for real? These real stats? 400, number 400. Hold on a minute.
[19336.33s -> 19344.09s]  Number 447 most watched. That's top 500. Number 42 most watched English variety channel.
[19345.13s -> 19360.42s]  Guys, that can't be correct. That's top 50. What? This is not like a, like a edit source,
[19360.42s -> 19364.44s]  right? Like this is a real website, right? You did, you're not just like giving me like an
[19364.44s -> 19387.86s]  edit source with a thing. No, no, but that's on my end. All right. Let's go. Top 500. Damn. All
[19387.86s -> 19396.66s]  right. I'm going to, I can't wait to tell my mom. No, I don't, I don't get there without people
[19396.66s -> 19418.47s]  that watch this channel. This is you guys, not me. See if we can break top 100. We'll see. I don't
[19418.47s -> 19424.04s]  know about that. But anyways, yeah, no, thanks. Thanks for watching. Thanks for being here. Thanks
[19424.04s -> 19430.36s]  for getting this channel even in like, even the top thousand, top 5,000, top 2,000. That's
[19430.36s -> 19434.36s]  still a fucking huge deal. That's a big deal to me and a big deal to this community. So for real,
[19437.51s -> 19449.59s]  peak viewers, I believe that's just for the month. Yeah. If I was a day, you'd be number one.
[19449.59s -> 19461.10s]  That would be impossible. But yeah, thanks. We'll check back in on it in another six months. See
[19461.10s -> 19470.39s]  where it is. Lewis Cheese, $10 from Lewis Cheese. Thanks for waking me up and for the new alarm
[19470.39s -> 19477.03s]  sound. You're welcome. Whatever you woke up for, hopefully you got it done. Whatever it was. Thank
[19477.03s -> 19485.88s]  you for the 10 bucks and good morning. Hey, Lobotomized Teddy Bear, thanks for the 250. Here
[19485.88s -> 19492.44s]  is a stream idea relating to fish. Eat Fugu puffer fish, but you have to cut it and eat it on stream.
[19493.00s -> 19495.88s]  You have to cut it and eat it on stream. It's a great idea. Nothing could go wrong.
[19501.05s -> 19505.69s]  No, I don't care if it's honestly, I would never eat that even if it was prepared by the most
[19505.69s -> 19527.11s]  talented chef in the world. I would not do a mini F. That's 58 drop frames in five and a half hours.
[19527.11s -> 19537.29s]  It's pretty good. I think we're back to normal. Yeah, great. Great stream idea. What's the next
[19537.29s -> 19551.14s]  one? Hey, I got a great stream idea. Roll around in cactuses. It'd be fun. I think I will abstain,
[19551.14s -> 19558.31s]  but thank you for the 250. Thank you Gnarly for the 250 again. How come whenever you do an
[19558.31s -> 19563.72s]  impression of someone, you start by saying, let me tell you something. Is it a voice acting technique
[19563.72s -> 19574.89s]  or just a habit? I don't know. They call those cadences. I guess that's one of mine.
[19575.85s -> 19586.78s]  Mannerisms, cadences. Let me tell you something. Hey, let me tell you something. Yeah, you're right.
[19586.78s -> 19592.46s]  Hey, let me tell you something. I think what that is, it's a way to tell the audience,
[19593.42s -> 19599.27s]  here comes a joke in my somewhere without me even being aware of it.
[19608.97s -> 19625.53s]  Maybe. Or it's a this is somebody else talking. Minus two incoming. Probably something like that.
[19625.53s -> 19635.38s]  Hey, feel 64. Thanks for the five dollars. I am glad you like fishing planet. It was fun playing
[19635.38s -> 19643.61s]  with you. Thanks for the recommendation. I did do the one guy in chat. It turned out to be a very,
[19643.61s -> 19648.01s]  very fun stream. So thank you. Feel 64 for the five dollars. The game is fun. It is.
[19654.23s -> 19660.39s]  Phylacter Lich gave $9.11. Sir, I'm going to need you to see how many fish you have.
[19660.39s -> 19665.43s]  Well, what do we have here? Someone's going to streamer jail. Oh, okay. I get it.
[19679.75s -> 19684.79s]  Thank you, Phylacter. And thank you for the 420, the four subs and then 20 subs,
[19684.87s -> 19693.03s]  community subs earlier. Thank you. Invader Z. Thanks for the 250. Hi, German. I was wondering
[19693.03s -> 19697.59s]  if you chose the carnival to be on the 21st because you sang the song September poorly once
[19697.59s -> 19707.69s]  or is that a coincidence? There's a 100% coincidence. Just happens to be on the same
[19707.69s -> 19721.16s]  date of my favorite song ever. I mean, it was just a coincidence. Thanks for the 250. Stinky
[19721.16s -> 19724.68s]  Beavers. Thanks for the 250. Hey, everybody. German here and welcome to a coffee commentary
[19724.68s -> 19737.40s]  of Justice in Doom. I remember those. I remember thinking that the ironic, like,
[19739.32s -> 19745.00s]  doom thing. I was doing like the ironic, like of doom thing. I don't think anyone
[19745.72s -> 19750.12s]  knew that. I think I just thought I was actually saying that, but I was.
[19754.17s -> 19759.48s]  You guys know what I mean. Like, oh, it's me of doom. Ha ha. It was like a meme for a while.
[19760.44s -> 19764.52s]  Yeah, yes. The Penguin of Doom, right? That was a meme for like a while, like 10 years ago.
[19765.88s -> 19779.13s]  Yeah, that's an old one. Surprising how more of you guys know what that is.
[19788.60s -> 19794.54s]  But thank you for the 250. Hey, Smelly Boy. Thanks for the 250, Smelly Boy. Put Fortnite
[19794.54s -> 19811.82s]  Jimmy in the next germ rumble. He deserves it. FlyingPixels. Thanks for those five community
[19811.82s -> 19817.70s]  subs earlier. I'm not sure I got them. Techno Rift. Thanks for the $14. Thank you, Techno Rift.
[19819.00s -> 19822.12s]  This has honestly been one of the most entertaining streams you've had in a while,
[19822.12s -> 19826.28s]  from the fishing escapades to the father-son fishing bonding experience.
[19827.00s -> 19831.64s]  Oh, I also got all these bits from watching like 500 ads for the last few months. Keep up the good
[19831.64s -> 19840.33s]  work. Well, I thank you for giving those to me. That seems like a lot of time spent watching ads.
[19840.33s -> 19852.09s]  Thanks for the $14. Really appreciate that. And it was a fun one. I had a great time. This was a
[19852.09s -> 19861.98s]  very, very fun stream for me. Thank you C4G for the 250. My girlfriend is watching this stream on
[19861.98s -> 19866.94s]  their PS4. And you were so audibly upset when you accidentally DM'd Jimmy again,
[19866.94s -> 19881.90s]  that someone came in to check if they were okay. Wait, what? Wait, they thought that they were in
[19881.90s -> 19894.50s]  there going like, no, I don't want to play. Jesus. Like, the person's being like beat up.
[19895.22s -> 19899.51s]  Oh, I don't want to, I don't want to type it. I don't want to type to that person.
[19900.31s -> 19906.90s]  It's like, is everything all right in here? Like, is there like a swarm of bees in your room?
[19906.90s -> 19932.44s]  What's going on? Oh, there's a wasp in your room. There's always a wasp in my room. But thank you
[19933.00s -> 19939.99s]  C4G for the 250. Everything's fun. Everything's good. Hey, Squibble, thanks for the $5. This is
[19939.99s -> 19943.35s]  probably the most activity fishing planet has ever seen. Thanks for the stream, dude.
[19944.23s -> 19949.70s]  Maybe somebody can play it and we'll like, yeah, this is actually a pretty fun little game.
[19950.66s -> 19959.13s]  Whatever, play it. It's just a game, all right, to play. That's a message from the dem.
[19963.19s -> 19968.26s]  But thank you, Squibble. I'm going to get the credits on the screen. We're going to get to the
[19968.26s -> 19973.94s]  end of the bits. Here they come. Special thanks to all of the new subs, the resubs, the community
[19973.94s -> 19985.05s]  subs, all of you. See y'all tomorrow for maximum action. That one's going to be a gamer stream.
[19985.94s -> 19994.18s]  So yesterday was like an on-camera like dickhead stream. Today was a relaxing fishing stream.
[19994.18s -> 19999.30s]  Tomorrow is going to be a gamer stream because that's a skill-based video game.
[20000.34s -> 20012.36s]  This was relaxing. I was relaxed. You can't tell me the first four hours of the stream wasn't just
[20012.36s -> 20025.38s]  hanging out and relaxing. It was. We talked about cheese. We talked about prosciutto.
[20026.10s -> 20032.52s]  That's all I remember. We had four and a half plus hours of conversations on this stream and
[20032.52s -> 20038.84s]  I only remember that somebody told me that I was wrong when I say the prosciutto is raw or something.
[20038.84s -> 20043.88s]  That's all I remember. Talked about the MCU and Far From Home is the best Spider-Man movie.
[20045.08s -> 20048.92s]  I remember writing that in the true true true true true true true true true true true true true.
[20048.92s -> 20073.69s]  That's all I saw over in the chat. But thank you everybody. Thank you snoozingcopter for the 250.
[20073.77s -> 20077.69s]  Oh my god Jeremy. I finally found you. Remember me? We were fishing together but then I got
[20077.69s -> 20081.29s]  separated from the group and fell into the pond and couldn't get out. I screamed for help but
[20081.29s -> 20086.57s]  nobody heard me. This game was more fun than I remember by the way. I feel like it's fun
[20086.57s -> 20093.00s]  just to open and play a game for a while. Yeah that's what I'm saying. Yeah that's right snoozingcopter.
[20094.12s -> 20100.49s]  Thanks for the 250. If I liked your elixir thanks for the five dollars. That was one bad mad dad.
[20101.13s -> 20111.19s]  Thank you. Thank you Sergio but for the 250 to be honest. Oh so no so be honest. Did you choose the
[20111.19s -> 20118.38s]  21st night of September intentionally for the carnival stream? I'm being honest it was I didn't
[20118.38s -> 20126.62s]  even pick that date. I gave a range of time and we sort of went back and forth on when it would be
[20126.62s -> 20135.22s]  and the 21st turned out to be the best day for everybody. So yes by coincidence.
[20137.14s -> 20147.51s]  Hey orange power thanks for the ten dollars orange power. Ten bucks. Hey Jeremy I've lived in Texas
[20147.51s -> 20155.59s]  all my life and I'm actually transferring to a college in New York for my sophomore year. I'm
[20155.59s -> 20158.47s]  actually really nervous about being in such a different environment from the one I've been in
[20158.47s -> 20165.19s]  all my life but your streams always give me the break I need. Keep it up. You keep it up as well.
[20166.07s -> 20175.00s]  That's a big change. I've never really been in New York for very long but the times that
[20175.00s -> 20179.56s]  I have spent there it's a pretty interesting place. A lot of cool stuff to do. A lot of cool
[20179.56s -> 20183.72s]  stuff to see in New York especially New York City. Not sure exactly where you'll be in New York
[20186.30s -> 20196.98s]  but good luck. I'm sure you do just fine. True Bostonian. He's never been to New York.
[20196.98s -> 20211.46s]  I have a few times. I have. I've been to Times Square but thank you orange power. Whatever you're
[20211.46s -> 20223.70s]  doing. Whatever college you're going to. Keep it up as you said to me. Finally Wolfgang 6789 gave
[20223.70s -> 20230.50s]  five community subs a few minutes ago. Thank you Wolfgang. And the last bit message of the night
[20230.50s -> 20238.65s]  250 from Colusia. Colusia thanks for the cozy stream. Now I can sleep peacefully. Have a great
[20238.65s -> 20246.15s]  night. Good night. Apologize to my cat who you terrified. I'm really sorry to Dubsky dude's
[20246.15s -> 20264.15s]  cat and whoever I scared from the werewolf. I'll see you guys tomorrow. Have a great night.
[20267.00s -> 20312.17s]  Take care. Talk soon. Like tomorrow.
