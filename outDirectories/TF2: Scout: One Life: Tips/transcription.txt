[1.59s -> 7.11s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a gameplay commentary on Team Fortress 2.
[7.11s -> 11.75s]  This is gonna be a one-life gameplay with the Scout, using the default scatter gun,
[11.75s -> 18.84s]  the Criticola, and the Sandman. This is the first time I've ever equipped the Sandman in a commentary,
[18.84s -> 24.36s]  ever, and not just a commentary. I haven't put this thing on probably since it came out back
[24.36s -> 30.10s]  in like 2008 or 2009, whenever they released this thing. I haven't used it once since then.
[30.10s -> 35.38s]  This is also on CP Gravel Pit, and it's on Defense if you couldn't already tell.
[35.38s -> 40.74s]  Now here, let me tell you why I'm playing Scout. Scout on Gravel Pit on Defense is really,
[40.74s -> 44.98s]  really awesome, because if you can see in the bottom of the screen, they have to capture these
[44.98s -> 50.98s]  two points, and you can go back and forth between these two points very, very quickly. So if somebody
[50.98s -> 56.66s]  gets on A, you can run to A. If somebody gets on B, you can run over to B. The other classes don't
[56.66s -> 60.18s]  really have that luxury. If you're playing a Soldier or a Heavy or something like that,
[60.18s -> 64.74s]  or even a Pyro, even one of the normal speed classes, you can't go back and forth between A
[64.74s -> 69.94s]  and B that quickly. So a lot of times, what will happen is somebody will sit on one point, let's
[69.94s -> 74.26s]  say A, and if B is getting captured, they'll just let it get captured, because they don't want to
[74.26s -> 81.56s]  leave their position at A and have them cap A as well. This happens in 95% of every single
[81.56s -> 86.20s]  Gravel Pit gameplay I've ever been on. And the way to combat it is you need a couple of good
[86.20s -> 91.16s]  Scouts. If you have two, maybe three Scouts on defense on Gravel Pit, and they're doing this
[91.16s -> 95.56s]  running back and forth between the two points, and they're good, it's going to be really, really
[95.56s -> 100.76s]  difficult for the blue team to cap any of the points. Especially because you have these structured,
[100.76s -> 105.24s]  big, heavy bomb classes like the Heavy or the Demoman, and if they sit in their positions and
[105.24s -> 108.84s]  they defend where they're standing, and you got these two or three Scouts running back and forth
[108.84s -> 113.16s]  to try and protect both of them, you can really close off a lot of choke points, and you can really
[113.16s -> 118.68s]  control the game. Now this particular gameplay started with A being captured already, but the
[118.68s -> 123.32s]  tip still remains. If you want to try and prevent stuff like this from happening from your entire
[123.32s -> 129.16s]  team just stuffing onto B or stuffing onto A, you got to get a good Scout, you got to get a couple
[129.16s -> 134.31s]  of good Scouts, and probably even a few Engineers as well. All right, freeze it right here. Want to
[134.31s -> 140.15s]  talk about one quick little thing before we get back into this. This Heavy right here is guaranteed
[141.11s -> 147.74s]  If I keep moving forward, if I go after this Heavy, I am definitely, there's zero chance I'm going to
[147.74s -> 154.46s]  beat this guy. If this Heavy has any aim at all, I'm dead. Never run yourself into death. If you see
[154.46s -> 159.98s]  a Heavy and there's an obstacle you can get around, get around it as soon as possible, because guys,
[159.98s -> 165.91s]  people have such short memories when it comes to Scouts. If you don't kill a Scout, chances are
[165.99s -> 171.27s]  you're going to say in your head, somebody else will deal with them, and everybody does that,
[171.27s -> 177.83s]  and nobody ever deals with them. So use that to your advantage as many times as you can.
[177.83s -> 181.75s]  So tip wise, that's all I can really give you today, but let's talk about a couple of things
[181.75s -> 186.39s]  in the game right now, especially the end of this game. You'll see what I'm talking about in a minute
[186.39s -> 192.33s]  or so. It's ridiculous. For the time being though, let's talk about what's going on on the screen now.
[192.33s -> 196.33s]  Scout tries to get me with a ball, which ends up being his demise, because he doesn't have the
[196.33s -> 201.05s]  extra couple shots that I had on him. Jumping up here with the ball, nobody really pays attention
[201.05s -> 205.37s]  to me when I do this by the way, and I feel like it happens for a lot of people. I've been in this
[205.37s -> 210.33s]  situation before as well, when a Scout comes up here and just smokes you, and remember this guy's
[210.33s -> 217.22s]  name, remember that sniper. He's important in about 10 to 20 seconds, you'll see. Trying to get an
[217.22s -> 221.94s]  overheal from this Medic, but he totally ignores me, which really really stinks, because I probably
[221.94s -> 226.34s]  could have used it really bad right here. End up getting this Scout jumping up into the corner
[226.34s -> 231.30s]  again. This is the part I'm talking about now, everybody pay attention, this is ridiculous.
[231.30s -> 236.50s]  So I'm not sure if this was lag or what actually happened here, but watch. Insta-death. Let's do a
[236.50s -> 241.94s]  little bit of German investigative reporting here. So take a look at what he's doing. He's facing
[241.94s -> 247.08s]  completely and totally forward with his arrow cocked. Look it, he's not even looking at me,
[247.08s -> 252.44s]  and somehow he magically kills me by shooting forward, but shooting to the right at the Saint
[252.44s -> 258.36s]  I don't know. I really don't know, and watch the chat. Watch the chat, ready? He says hee hee,
[258.36s -> 262.76s]  almost like he knew that was gonna happen, or he planned it, and maybe it was just lag and he's
[262.76s -> 267.64s]  laughing about the lag. Not sure, but that's gonna be the end of the game guys. Thank you so much for
[267.64s -> 271.80s]  watching, I really do appreciate it, and if you liked this video, go ahead and shoot me a like,
[271.80s -> 275.64s]  and I'll see you guys all next time. Take care everybody.
