[0.38s -> 10.26s]  Okay, I am back. So we're gonna hang out. I believe... when's the Bethesda
[10.26s -> 22.95s]  conference? It's in like an hour, right? 4 p.m. Pacific? So in like two hours? Okay.
[22.95s -> 29.02s]  So I'm gonna play Cooking Simulator. We're gonna pick up right where I left
[29.02s -> 35.72s]  off in the meantime. And then we're gonna do the Bethesda conference. And
[35.72s -> 39.53s]  then that's probably... I don't think I'm gonna do Devolver. Because Devolver
[39.53s -> 45.09s]  every year kind of has... it's not necessarily a live conference, right? It's
[45.09s -> 55.09s]  kind of like a edited video. They do like a little special thing, right? But
[55.09s -> 60.99s]  I'll be back tomorrow for Square Enix and... what's the other one? What the hell
[60.99s -> 72.58s]  is they doing? At Ubisoft, right? We'll do that tomorrow as well. Let's get
[72.58s -> 75.58s]  Cooking Simulator open while we just chill. By the way, remind me when
[75.58s -> 81.06s]  we're like 10 minutes out, because I will forget and I will be late to the
[81.94s -> 97.73s]  conference. Let's get it open. You should see it on the screen. Very shortly. Like
[97.73s -> 112.74s]  as in right now. Hey, there it is. No one tell him anything. You have to
[112.74s -> 124.34s]  remind me. I'm not gonna be able to remember. Are we still doing the floor
[124.34s -> 134.30s]  soup? Yes. Corporate? What do you mean corporate streamer? Which is
[134.30s -> 149.62s]  soup yard, right? A 12 balance. Which one is it? This one, right? He's not
[149.62s -> 156.12s]  gonna know. No, I'm paying attention. I got a clock right in front of me.
[156.20s -> 172.74s]  This is loud. Hold on. Loud, loud, loud, loud, loud. There we go. That's better. It's not as
[172.74s -> 178.97s]  loud now. Okay, so for those of you that have no idea what the hell is going on,
[178.97s -> 185.21s]  you may be just still hanging out here after the Microsoft conference. This
[185.21s -> 189.80s]  is a soup house. And I got... hold on. There's stuff already going on. Duck broth.
[189.80s -> 194.33s]  I already got that made, right? Why are there eggs in here? Oh, there's oil in there still.
[194.33s -> 198.78s]  Why? What's going on? All right, here we go. The duck is right here. I got my
[198.86s -> 212.10s]  duck broth right here. And it's just a few pieces of this, right? All right,
[212.10s -> 221.16s]  that's done. Floor organization. Yeah, I... I pre-made a bunch of this shit. And,
[222.73s -> 226.49s]  okay, it's... I don't know why it's doing this. I just lost fame for that.
[227.91s -> 231.51s]  That's... I'm reloading. That's bullshit. That's absolutely fucking stupid.
[232.15s -> 240.09s]  How long till Bethesda? Just about two hours. I do not deserve that.
[241.43s -> 251.10s]  Let's try this again. Grab the soup. Grab a few pieces of duck. Okay.
[253.13s -> 258.94s]  Some of the pieces of duck don't stay in. I don't know why. I can't... I don't know why.
[258.94s -> 264.57s]  You get two. Can I put three in here? All right, these are all in here. They're not moving.
[266.04s -> 275.19s]  Go. Oh my fucking god. I can't do anything about it. I can't. I'm gonna lose fame every
[275.19s -> 284.73s]  time. You saw... I tried. I really did. All right, here we go. I need to make a pork chop.
[285.45s -> 294.55s]  Pork rabbit. Do I have one ready? I got one of these ready. What is it? Uh, eight? I don't
[294.55s -> 309.75s]  remember. It's eight. Yeah. Eight chive. Yeah. There's probably a bunch of people that are just
[309.75s -> 311.99s]  like, what the hell are you doing? Why is everything on the floor? This game...
[312.87s -> 323.19s]  I just like threw it at them. What just happened? What's going on? Did it dump? No,
[323.19s -> 339.67s]  it dumped. It was forward dumping. They didn't patch it. This makes no sense. They
[339.67s -> 347.80s]  did not patch out the floor soup. No way. It's only been like two days. Okay, hold on.
[347.80s -> 358.34s]  I'm gonna start with the pork chops first. Pork chop. Grab one. Get this seasoned up. It is
[359.06s -> 371.32s]  four salt, four pepper. There is four salt. There's already a pork chop out here, but
[371.32s -> 382.71s]  whatever. I can use it later. And then it's time, right? Six time. Yep. If this thing
[382.71s -> 391.90s]  falls off a plate, I'm gonna go play pick-ross. Okay, how much oil? There's plenty of oil. There's
[391.90s -> 397.21s]  plenty of oil in the pan already. Turn it on. Get this cooked up. I already have the potatoes
[397.21s -> 404.23s]  ready. All right, that's going. Uh, potatoes are already done over here. I have my potato
[404.23s -> 414.47s]  section, right? Right here. They're good. And then, okay, now the duck. This should... I don't
[414.47s -> 422.14s]  know why this is not working. They definitely did not patch this. Somebody go look at their
[422.14s -> 429.22s]  notes. If you have food that's been sitting out for more than four days, does it just
[429.22s -> 450.62s]  disappear? Pull it up. Okay, it's still... it's fine. Got it. Finally. See? It's fine. That's
[450.62s -> 458.92s]  like a four-star meal. Bachelor. I'm gonna flip this in a few seconds. Gaspacho comes in next.
[458.92s -> 479.50s]  No, another duck. Some of these pieces just don't stay in. That's the issue. Okay, this
[479.50s -> 489.67s]  is good too. Yeah, the strategy here is the game doesn't really care that much if your
[489.67s -> 498.36s]  food is four or five days old. Oh, here we go. So I just made a ton of shit in advance.
[509.50s -> 521.38s]  Got it. Okay. Uh, what's next? What was it? Oh, it's fish, fish, fish, fish, fish. That'll
[521.38s -> 528.54s]  be done soon. And I got the plate. I got the, uh, trout. Uh, I want to get this off.
[528.54s -> 538.65s]  There we go. It's a pepper thyme dill. Almost. Pepper thyme dill, pepper thyme dill, dill,
[538.81s -> 550.76s]  dill, dill, dill. Oh shit. That's pepper again. What? How did I just do that? How did I just do
[550.76s -> 563.11s]  that? I don't know how I even just did that. It's because there's two peppers. I think...
[563.11s -> 572.09s]  Where's dill? Dill, dill, dill. I don't think I even have it out. Cayenne. Salt. Where's dill?
[572.73s -> 601.22s]  Well, I gotta take this out. I need a plate. Come here. All right. Potatoes. Six, right?
[601.78s -> 617.62s]  I need to make more of these. There's nothing bold on it. That's just spices.
[617.62s -> 625.06s]  It's seasoning. All right, now I need to make the trout. I have a little to work fast on this one.
[625.06s -> 642.17s]  Oh, come on. Fine. I don't care. Uh, this is... I don't have any dill. Did I lose the dill?
[642.17s -> 658.82s]  Do I actually have to buy dill again? Did I throw it away? Okay, get this in the oven.
[661.98s -> 675.18s]  Come on. Get in there. No, pick it up. Okay, that's gonna cook. And then I need
[675.82s -> 689.83s]  a lemon. How's that doing? That's doing fine. Where's my knife? I threw it the last time I played
[690.87s -> 702.87s]  somewhere. Sh**. This is not good. Didn't I throw it out the window? I think I threw the knife
[702.87s -> 719.85s]  out the window last time. I have no idea. I gotta buy one though. Okay, um, get that
[719.85s -> 732.82s]  cut into fours. Good. And a plate. Which one's gonna be done first? I gotta flip that. Oh,
[732.82s -> 748.52s]  fuck. where's my spatula? quick quick quick quick quick go go go go cook. are you cooking? thank you.
[748.52s -> 758.89s]  okay get this out. and then what's the little herb that goes on it? parsley? i don't remember.
[760.34s -> 777.50s]  it's uh parsley. eight? six. presentation is lacking but it's okay. that was pretty good.
[780.17s -> 791.30s]  i didn't put horseradish on it. oh well. what i still have to make? what? pork chop. oh tomato
[791.30s -> 799.72s]  soup. i got that. ready to go. i have a lot of tomato soups actually. don't have to do
[799.72s -> 815.27s]  anything. that looks fucking gross. it's not gross. it's called preparation. tuna cake.
[817.74s -> 830.23s]  this is almost done. open. okay this is salt and pepper and that's it. right let's get this out of
[830.23s -> 851.48s]  plate. plate and then i don't have any potatoes. uh yeah i do. same fucking thing. sorry we ran
[851.48s -> 865.51s]  out of potato chips. we have baked potatoes. didn't lose any fame. that's fine. all right
[865.51s -> 873.34s]  let's get this tuna right. salt and pepper five grams. you got it. duck i got that ready
[873.34s -> 888.86s]  to go. there it is. one two three four five. stick it. get rid of it. salt. i wouldn't eat
[888.86s -> 896.84s]  here. yes you would. oh shit. a little too much. it's okay. throw it on the grill for how long?
[896.84s -> 911.22s]  80 seconds aside. throw it on the grill. now we need uh lemon cut into slices. four slices
[911.22s -> 937.72s]  of lemon. i got that. okay one two three whatever. i can clean them up. they're not
[937.72s -> 942.95s]  lucky. i can clean them up. watch this. ready. how much time? almost time. any more food that came

[973.80s -> 982.58s]  this is uh salt and pepper. good thing i have one ready to go here. let's see four or five.
[983.22s -> 998.71s]  five. start a fire. waste the salt. running a kitchen is way too hard. why why? i thought
[998.71s -> 1007.06s]  it was salt. i didn't. what? what's going on? why am i? what fucking weird mystery world is this?
[1007.06s -> 1015.93s]  i don't understand. why was it? it was already salt and pepper on it. i don't. when did i do that?
[1017.03s -> 1030.78s]  oh. did i do? i must have done that like five days ago. well this is. no they'll be fine.
[1030.78s -> 1050.34s]  they don't. i gotta clean this though. all right. 10 oil. that's good enough. all right.

[1056.94s -> 1071.37s]  potatoes cooked. how's this doing? it's a deep bowl. no i don't want that. i gotta turn this

[1155.51s -> 1162.06s]  nothing else right? no. just wait for this to be done. grab it up and then go. cook the

[1190.73s -> 1205.99s]  it's two big potatoes. that's it. potato. that's it. all right. my inventory is low on soup. i gotta

[1217.11s -> 1223.51s]  i got plenty of tomato. how much gazpacho do i have? all right. running low on gazpacho. i gotta
[1223.51s -> 1234.26s]  make uh duck broth, duck breast, and gazpacho. let's get that going. duck broth. so i need
[1236.74s -> 1247.61s]  water. 1.3 liters. wait. what do you mean? i can't pronounce. can't pronounce what?
[1247.61s -> 1257.24s]  no. not yet. i need uh other shit in here. i need a carrot. what's it? a carrot and an onion?
[1258.70s -> 1265.29s]  and then the duck breasts? that's it, right? carrot, onion, and then two duck breasts.
[1269.43s -> 1279.18s]  and then salt the hell out of it. what if i just put like five duck breasts in here
[1279.18s -> 1291.54s]  and then have them forever? i'll never have to cook these ever again. i'll get like five.
[1292.18s -> 1320.04s]  okay. now move it around a little just so i can. did i just pull the water out? 50 50
[1320.04s -> 1325.42s]  milliliters of duck breast. okay. this is good, right? i gotta salt the water too. don't forget
[1325.42s -> 1341.88s]  that. how much time do i got? plenty. add a loaf of bread. 10? that's enough salt. let's go.
[1341.88s -> 1348.18s]  these are all cooking. good good good. all right. now we're gonna do gazpacho. do i
[1348.18s -> 1353.77s]  remember the gazpacho? i can't even say that fucking word. let's see if i remember it.
[1357.72s -> 1373.67s]  it was two cucumbers, three tomatoes, a loaf of bread. i forget the rest. is it two bell peppers
[1373.67s -> 1383.59s]  or three bell peppers? i think it's three. and that's it, right? or is there an onion?
[1387.88s -> 1394.90s]  and then one onion. oh no, that's garlic. garlic. that's it. and then i go over here,
[1396.78s -> 1408.22s]  grind it up. okay. then i add this shit. i think it's 30 of this, right? and then
[1408.22s -> 1430.52s]  where's the other one? it's like some kind of oil. give me a break. okay. three. this is fucking
[1430.52s -> 1444.79s]  dumb. the whole thing wouldn't spill. it's salt, pepper, and then there's an oil? where's my oil?
[1449.72s -> 1465.06s]  right here. okay. and then 10 salt, 10 pepper. grind it up again. that's dill. oh shit. oh my
[1465.06s -> 1491.74s]  god. okay. it's done. yeah. right? laugh. everybody laugh. please laugh. please clap. all
[1491.74s -> 1497.06s]  right. it's done. that's good. it's just sitting there a little overcooked on the onions, but
[1497.06s -> 1509.22s]  some people like crispy onions. that looks good. don't need more than two. we have 120, 250.
[1509.78s -> 1520.97s]  that's good. put this down for a minute. i could probably do two more, three more. let's find
[1520.97s -> 1535.94s]  out. this might be it. can i get one more in here? okay. that's good. that should be
[1535.94s -> 1545.54s]  enough. almost almost landed perfectly. these are all capped up. all right. now i need to
[1546.02s -> 1552.76s]  duck broth. how much time? five. i got plenty of time. this is fine. all right. i want to put
[1552.76s -> 1561.98s]  the broth over here where it was before. that's tomato. let's get this over here.
[1562.62s -> 1571.45s]  all right. i need like three or four more plates. plates do not break anymore, right?
[1571.45s -> 1579.13s]  yeah. i got that upgrade. just get them over there. i gotta be careful though because i will
[1579.13s -> 1595.38s]  knock over all the tomato soups. one more? okay. let's set them up. oof. that frame rate.
[1595.94s -> 1608.23s]  i think i'm just gonna cook like five tuna steaks too if i have time.
[1609.58s -> 1618.26s]  let's get all these out so i can cut them. where's my cutting board? we're gonna skimp the
[1618.26s -> 1624.78s]  absolute fuck out of this too. i'm gonna have duck breast for like a month. it's gonna be
[1624.78s -> 1644.73s]  great. the onions doesn't need it. it's fine. i mean the knife. nice and thin. nice and thin.
[1644.73s -> 1669.96s]  ready? check it. it's so much duck. all right. put the knife down. it's so tender. is this
[1669.96s -> 1681.62s]  all gonna fit on here? no. no, it's not. just give me... hold on. let me get another... i need
[1681.62s -> 1695.00s]  to get another plate. that's not gonna happen. i need a big plate. here we go. that's raw. no,
[1695.00s -> 1701.10s]  this is what duck is supposed to look like. you ever had duck before? it looks like this.
[1701.66s -> 1711.67s]  there's a couple more pieces of duck on the table. it doesn't? yes it does. duck is like
[1711.67s -> 1720.87s]  green in the middle. it's not. okay. got my duck ready. my broth is ready to be poured
[1720.87s -> 1740.76s]  into the bowls. is there an extra duck breast under there? nice. there is. all right. 230.
[1740.76s -> 1757.00s]  let's see if i can spread this out around 5. 250. 220. 380. it's still a little more. what's
[1757.00s -> 1768.47s]  when this one needs a little more? let's transfer some of these into here. and then
[1768.47s -> 1777.85s]  i'm gonna cook up like a bunch of meat too. easy with this. don't fucking drop it. all
[1777.85s -> 1786.74s]  right. so i got my broth. i got one more breast in here. where is it? let's cut it up.
[1787.38s -> 1800.47s]  oops. let's make this one even thinner. i want paper thin slices of duck. i still got a minute left.
[1806.41s -> 1821.29s]  jeremy, no. wait, why not? you trick your brain into thinking there's more food.
[1821.85s -> 1839.93s]  this is a really good technique. i'm telling you. did that not even cut? no, it did. okay.
[1845.61s -> 1857.21s]  that looks pretty good. i would eat this. see, you got two different kinds of duck. you get
[1857.21s -> 1862.78s]  like breast meat and like thigh meat. all right. almost time to go. uh what do i need
[1862.78s -> 1875.62s]  to do before this continues? um okay. i got time in the beginning. 130 bucks. i have a bunch of
[1875.62s -> 1880.71s]  time in the beginning of this day too. uncooked versus cooked. some people want raw meat.
[1881.27s -> 1895.70s]  i want more time in the beginning of the day. maybe fame points. let's see. how much is it
[1895.70s -> 1901.06s]  for more time during the day? better tips. faster repairs. uh easier. where is it? extended
[1901.06s -> 1908.65s]  cleaning phase. extended preparation phase. here we go. yeah. that's important. and then
[1908.65s -> 1916.49s]  i'm gonna do the fame one. more fame points. where is it? where is it? come on. this one right
[1916.49s -> 1925.75s]  here. all right. shitty fame is still fame. yeah. hey. any publicity is good publicity, right?
[1926.87s -> 1930.23s]  people really like our salmon steak and boiled potatoes. so it's our dish of the day. all
[1930.23s -> 1935.64s]  right. that's i'm gonna make like 10 of them. okay. uh let's get two burners going. three
[1935.64s -> 1960.71s]  burners going. i gotta change the music. that's okay. that's good. triple burner. 10 oil in
[1960.71s -> 1975.78s]  each one. a little bit. no. that's fine. oops. okay. got oil in each one. let's get three salmon
[1975.78s -> 1992.81s]  steaks out here. one, two, three. potatoes. i'm gonna boil the fuck out of a bunch of
[1992.81s -> 1998.09s]  potatoes too. okay. we need potatoes in the back. i only have one potato. so let's fill a pot
[1998.09s -> 2022.97s]  with potatoes. water and salt. from the floor to your mouth. yes. all right. it's 20. 20
[2022.97s -> 2041.59s]  salt or 10 salt. i think it's 20. okay. now i'm gonna fit as many as i can fit in this
[2041.59s -> 2063.77s]  jar. potato. here we go. ready? how many can i fit in here? i need at least this many. all right.
[2063.77s -> 2068.71s]  that's... i don't think i can fit much more. no. okay. that's all i can fit.
[2070.15s -> 2074.63s]  are these gonna cook? let's hope so. all right. get them all going. wait. no, no, no. not yet.
[2074.63s -> 2103.42s]  yeah. just boil the potatoes. are these cooking? some of them are. give me another one.
[2103.42s -> 2113.94s]  whatever. i'll just move them around. it's fine. all right. uh i need my salmon steaks.
[2113.94s -> 2121.24s]  salt and pepper on each one of these. throw it in there. how much salt is in each one? five

[2452.15s -> 2459.53s]  day. this person is going to get a fresh one. salmon first order coming up. it's going to be
[2459.53s -> 2467.35s]  burning hot. this is like sumi hot. that's french fries and a steak. that's not what i
[2467.35s -> 2474.62s]  thought we were going to make. this is already to go. all right. don't fall off
[2474.70s -> 2513.99s]  immediately. steak. salt and pepper. it's four and four, right? point four. and how do i turn
[2513.99s -> 2528.28s]  that on? baked steak. that's gonna be disgusting. so cut potato into sticks. oh, i gotta make
[2528.28s -> 2534.12s]  french fries. okay. i need more. these are still cooking. oh no. just get them in the
[2534.12s -> 2554.07s]  potato holder. okay. potatoes. i'm just gonna get a ton of them. i'm gonna make a ton
[2554.07s -> 2563.48s]  of french fries. like too many. i'm gonna add french fries to every single dish. all
[2563.48s -> 2575.86s]  right. that's fine. i'm gonna chop these up into french fries. how's the steak looking?
[2575.86s -> 2596.55s]  why does it say salmon filet? it's done. there's a salmon in here. okay. i got potato.
[2597.19s -> 2606.68s]  let's cut this all up. these are gonna be just standard french fries. these are gonna
[2606.68s -> 2681.69s]  be like steak fries. hold on. you're making pringles. pringles. thousand potatoes a second.
[2681.69s -> 2692.50s]  are they done? all right. these look. these are like steak fries. my game's gonna crash. oh god.
[2692.50s -> 2698.44s]  okay. give me the fryer later. where's my fryer later? it's on the ground over here somewhere.
[2702.36s -> 2708.89s]  where's the fryer later? where's the fryer? why are there potatoes in the soup over here?
[2711.62s -> 2744.14s]  it's on the ground somewhere. where the fuck is it? ah. wasn't it just sitting on the ground?
[2744.14s -> 2763.27s]  see? they're like steak fries. all right. there's a whole potato in here though,
[2763.27s -> 2779.43s]  unfortunately. i'll. it doesn't matter. i can cut it up later. is the oil coming up?
[2779.43s -> 2789.11s]  is the oil in there, right? yeah. okay. they're gone. all right. good.
[2789.11s -> 2799.66s]  uh. i got a few minutes left. i'll be fine. this is good. they don't take very long.
[2799.66s -> 2819.40s]  and then i gotta salt them up. all right. good. almost done. potatoes are done.
[2856.89s -> 2866.82s]  a sick fuck to do that. all right. just like five guys. that shit happens.
[2867.70s -> 2869.78s]  oh. look. it's my camouflage thing.
[2873.34s -> 2877.26s]  that does happen at five guys. they give you like a joke amount. all right. here we go.
[2877.26s -> 2882.92s]  already done. got it. bingo. five stars. incoming.
[2888.07s -> 2913.66s]  ooh. tasty. duck. you know i got that already. what was what? whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
[2913.66s -> 2923.34s]  what's matter with it? not enough pepper. too much duck breast. what do you mean not enough
[2923.34s -> 2937.00s]  pepper? what? did i fuck up the broth? i didn't fuck up the broth, did i? all right. speaking of
[2937.00s -> 2941.03s]  broth. here. because look. this is. this has been sitting here for like at least two weeks.
[2941.75s -> 2956.50s]  this is going to be fine. see? i must have screwed the recipe up. espachio with uh.
[2956.50s -> 2972.17s]  there's already one end here sitting on the edge. all right. these are good.
[2973.85s -> 2981.10s]  what's next? i gotta pick up these potatoes. uh. it's gonna be salmon, i guess. i'm guessing.
[2981.74s -> 2990.07s]  no. another duck. but this is not right. this is not seasoned correctly. i have so much of it too.
[2990.95s -> 3003.22s]  too much duck. maybe give them only two pieces. let me see. it's gotta be something i messed up
[3003.22s -> 3009.24s]  in the seasoning. yep. i fucked up the broth. i'm gonna have to remake the broth. god damn
[3009.24s -> 3014.76s]  it. yeah. not enough pepper. too much duck? not enough salt. well i'm gonna salt it in
[3014.76s -> 3021.54s]  pepper before i give it to them. yeah. that didn't do the broth right. uh. it's all good.
[3021.54s -> 3039.34s]  tomato soup. i got that over here. all right. that's good. oh. it's because i put
[3039.34s -> 3050.12s]  way too much duck in the broth. all right. that sucks. i'll make this one perfect.
[3054.50s -> 3117.59s]  pepper time dill. i'm gonna do it perfect. i can't rinse it off. okay. did i? pepper. not salt.
[3117.59s -> 3153.06s]  pepper time dill. time dill. pepper time dill. this is dill, right? yeah. and then horse
[3153.06s -> 3176.02s]  riders, when it comes out, go in. clown cooking. all right. i need a big bowl for
[3176.02s -> 3198.49s]  this. a big plate. thank god. what? the water? hey, i got plenty of potatoes. these look actually
[3198.49s -> 3207.27s]  pretty good. they look like kind of yummy chips. they actually do look kind of good.
[3207.27s -> 3217.19s]  let's stick these over here out of the way. nice. nice like flavor explosion.
[3227.78s -> 3233.14s]  what the hell? all right. i need duck. it's gonna be fucked up, but whatever.
[3234.30s -> 3239.29s]  too much duck. i'm gonna go one piece. this is all fucked. doesn't matter.
[3243.56s -> 3251.22s]  i'll fix it for tomorrow. at least if i don't lose points, it's fine. it's a net zero.
[3257.08s -> 3261.48s]  horseradish. and then what is it? what else do you need? a lemon into quarters, right?
[3264.90s -> 3272.01s]  hey, our special of the day is salmon. oh, just kidding. it's actually duck five times.
[3272.01s -> 3277.14s]  this is the third or fourth time it's been duck. there's only been one salmon.
[3277.78s -> 3304.42s]  okay. new plate. horseradish. trout's not burning. it's good. i need a horseradish
[3304.42s -> 3324.73s]  right here. nice. lemons on there. get this one perfect. and then it's parsley. six. this
[3324.73s -> 3331.42s]  one will be good. this should be at least five stars. four or five stars. that's perfect.
[3333.69s -> 3349.82s]  yeah. there we go. i'm bringing it back. is something still cooking? the oven is just on.
[3349.82s -> 3370.63s]  there you go. not bad. duck broth again. we're going for not losing points on the
[3370.63s -> 3376.79s]  duck broth. i'm gonna season it. salt and pepper, right? let me get this out quickly.
[3377.27s -> 3405.40s]  perfect. so what was wrong with the duck? do i need more salt? is it salt or pepper?
[3405.40s -> 3427.14s]  and where's the salt? that looks like a mess. salt. i need like a salt in every corner of the
[3427.14s -> 3440.15s]  room. okay. i seasoned it up. let's put some duck on here. and hopefully we can at least
[3440.15s -> 3454.02s]  get three stars. net zero. thank god. still under seasoned? too much pepper and too much salt.
[3454.02s -> 3461.59s]  so i needed to dilute it with water. i'm here. it was too much. all right. i need another trout.
[3462.15s -> 3507.29s]  okay. here we go. duck. too much salt and too much pepper. let's see if diluting helps.
[3513.80s -> 3524.47s]  yep. yeah, it does. now there's not enough pepper. bake trout. i can do the trout. i'm
[3524.47s -> 3529.14s]  gonna make this one perfect again because i'll get more fame points. and what do you know?
[3529.14s -> 3550.76s]  i got this right now. ready to move. all right. it was... okay. it's black pepper.
[3550.76s -> 3574.04s]  pepper time dil. other than a minute. come on. pepper time dil with time. into the oven.
[3574.04s -> 3597.11s]  throw gazpacho out. it should be good to go. gazpacho. bethesda's live? no they're not. is
[3597.11s -> 3614.33s]  it... what time is it? why are you saying that? you almost got me there. all right. new music.
[3614.33s -> 3623.03s]  okay. where's my trout? it's not even close. all right. i need to do pork chop.
[3623.03s -> 3646.78s]  i have a pork chop just sitting out. yes i do. what? no. cancel. what are you doing?
[3651.53s -> 3681.67s]  turn off the fucking water, please. if i lost my mind... there's nothing in here. oh,
[3681.67s -> 3689.10s]  i almost got it perfect. uh, i need... what's the... it's... what's the seasoning? salt,
[3689.10s -> 3705.06s]  pepper, time. oh my fucking god. why does this have so much on it already? when did i season
[3705.06s -> 3736.14s]  this? okay. lemon. plate and lemon. oh, it's a little... it's off. it's off. it's okay though.
[3736.14s -> 3749.19s]  it's fine. it's just barely hanging on the edges. actually, presentation-wise, it looks
[3749.19s -> 3774.95s]  pretty good. parsley, right? why? where'd the fish go? where's the fish? where did it go?
[3774.95s -> 3782.58s]  it fell into the ground. i don't see it anywhere. okay. well, that's fantastic. great. i'm glad. um,
[3783.14s -> 3823.98s]  okay. what just came in? come on! hurry up! go go go go go go go go!
[3823.98s -> 3850.54s]  come on! 30 seconds! 20 seconds! it's almost done! i had to get it out. it was still
[3850.54s -> 3857.35s]  fine. not gonna lose points. all right. we got the pork chop. that's it. we just need the
[3857.35s -> 3864.84s]  potatoes. we just need the cooked chip potatoes. i don't have any of those. we'll just use these.
[3867.56s -> 3908.90s]  plate. that's way too many. i gotta take some off. done. it was the potatoes. sorry,
[3908.90s -> 3922.52s]  i'm not gonna lose any points. that's it, right? anymore? i'll clean up. i'll make this one
[3922.52s -> 3928.87s]  perfect. i have to. and i mean, like, the best i could possibly do. i don't have another one
[3928.87s -> 3935.18s]  that was made. all right, hold on. salt, pepper. let's get them both out here. these two
[3935.18s -> 3942.71s]  are gonna be good. they're both just salt and pepper. this one... i already got the boiled
[3942.71s -> 3948.78s]  potatoes. this one is not... it's not clean, but it's okay. speaking of clean... is this clean?
[3961.59s -> 3969.30s]  10 in here. a little too much oil, but it's fine. all right, so now i'm gonna get these
[3969.30s -> 3982.94s]  going. salt and pepper on both. is it five on both or is it four on both? five on this one.
[3983.88s -> 3993.13s]  five on both. come on, i did it five times. why do you do that? i clearly just clicked
[3993.13s -> 4013.11s]  on it. salt. and this goes on the grill. this goes on the pan. all right, let's go.
[4014.86s -> 4024.74s]  bang. get it on. all right, now i need to do... i got the potatoes. this one's already done.
[4025.88s -> 4049.02s]  and then i need to lemon into slices. four slices. flip it. yeah, yeah, yeah. where's
[4049.02s -> 4075.22s]  my spatula? how's this going? pretty good. make lemon fries. that would actually probably
[4075.22s -> 4101.46s]  be kind of good. almost time to flip. and flip it. same deal over here. uh,
[4104.18s -> 4113.22s]  not quite. i definitely... i have to flip it again, though. take a look at that char. i know
[4113.22s -> 4127.19s]  it's a beautiful char. and this beautiful bird shit all over this grill. i'm gonna flip it.
[4130.10s -> 4135.13s]  okay, good. let it cook the rest. this one's almost going to take off. put on a plate,
[4135.13s -> 4142.47s]  almost. let's get this down. and i needed... what do you need with this? just two potatoes
[4142.47s -> 4161.11s]  for that one. and then this one needs the lemon slices and oregano. you got it. almost,
[4161.11s -> 4181.78s]  almost. go, go, go, go, go. bethesda is starting? no, it's not starting. i keep looking over here
[4181.78s -> 4190.12s]  and i see... bethesda, hurry! starting in five minutes. done. okay, this is just lemon slices.
[4190.12s -> 4221.70s]  lemon slices and then oregano. how many? eight. that should be the end of the day.
[4221.70s -> 4226.66s]  that's perfect. that's a lot of points. good. how does a full five star not have more points?
[4228.76s -> 4234.87s]  all right, i think we're probably gonna get a new recipe here. is salmon steak hanging
[4234.87s -> 4245.22s]  out? whatever. throw it away. all right, i need to do some cleaning. just put everything in the
[4245.22s -> 4266.10s]  sink. is this clean? this is not clean. let's get that set. turn off the stove. this is clean.
[4266.90s -> 4276.79s]  this is fine. there's a salmon just still in there. all right, let's get the repair man.
[4276.79s -> 4280.73s]  all these potatoes, are they cooked? no. put them back. can i put them back?
[4285.40s -> 4308.09s]  so much junk. i gotta get the bucket. clean up the floor. all right, that's in.
[4309.43s -> 4320.10s]  it's out. it's in. carrot on the ground. send this for food. that's not gonna work.
[4320.10s -> 4329.13s]  there's nothing to send. okay, i can clean that up. put it back up there. nothing in the ground
[4329.13s -> 4340.01s]  over here. there's a couple of these things. and that should be good. a little bit over here.
[4345.86s -> 4356.34s]  all right, dump it. set this back up. oh, i would throw these away, but i don't want to.
[4357.86s -> 4361.06s]  yeah, i will. it's a fucking mess over here. it's an absolute mess.
[4375.29s -> 4386.79s]  what is happening with this? why does it keep doing this? how much time? 20. i'm gonna stick
[4386.79s -> 4395.48s]  this down. and the person beeping the horn is gonna drive me insane. let's wash the counter.
[4396.30s -> 4407.99s]  put the horseradish over here. see, i'm cleaning. you guys think i'm not gonna clean?
[4408.55s -> 4414.81s]  i'm gonna have to get a repair man in here. because this is all messed up. this looks like
[4414.81s -> 4433.93s]  crap. i can't believe Todd Howard just announced Rat Movie 3. that would be interesting.
[4434.65s -> 4447.86s]  that would be really strange. i'm gonna put this away in the mop. watch out for the floor.
[4448.58s -> 4468.78s]  no more spills, right? nope. okay, now i need repair. i'm gonna fix all this bullshit in here.
[4469.42s -> 4489.43s]  need a new fridge? fix that. just fix everything. fix this. fix this. fix the
[4489.43s -> 4496.06s]  fryer later. fix the stove. anything else need to be repaired? i don't think so. what about
[4496.06s -> 4510.94s]  the counter? i can't fix the counter? yeah, i can. fix the counter. money well spent. how much time
[4510.94s -> 4521.80s]  do i have? all right, so i have to... i need to make some shit. i gotta make some stuff. let's
[4521.80s -> 4536.81s]  move this cayenne pepper back over here. i need a little spice rack. how am i doing on soups?
[4536.81s -> 4546.82s]  i need to make another gazpacho? no, this looks like enough. three, three. i need to make
[4546.90s -> 4551.58s]  what? yeah, i got plenty of tomato. i gotta make some duck. this is all junk, i think.
[4552.30s -> 4577.03s]  it's just not made right. this is junk. unfortunately, i had to do that. when is
[4577.03s -> 4585.91s]  the bethesda conference? it is in, i think, like 30 minutes? 40 minutes? let me check.
[4585.91s -> 4591.98s]  what just happened? what just happened? what's going on? what the hell just happened?
[4599.22s -> 4607.59s]  uh, well, that's great. it's been 90 minutes. yeah, so we got plenty of time. uh, that
[4607.59s -> 4615.59s]  just broke this raspberry juice. i need to just get rid of this, because this is just
[4615.75s -> 4642.63s]  every time i put this down, it just causes a problem. i have to carry this around with me.
[4642.63s -> 4648.46s]  okay, good. well, now i have more shit to clean up. that's great. i'm gonna make a
[4648.46s -> 4659.91s]  gazpacho. no, duck. let's try this again. 1.3, and then what? 12 salt, 12 pepper,
[4659.91s -> 4670.44s]  and two ducks. that's what the recipe was last time. so i'll season this up.
[4672.14s -> 4681.42s]  one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. it's 12 and 12,
[4682.06s -> 4691.34s]  i think. or maybe 10, but it's okay if it's a little bit over. again, i'm missing the salt. again.
[4693.21s -> 4696.81s]  yet again, i have no idea where the salt is. i'm just gonna buy five of them and put them in
[4696.81s -> 4713.54s]  every corner. i don't care. they're two cents. i'm gonna do the same thing with pepper.
[4713.54s -> 4734.46s]  there'll always be one, no matter where i am. there we go. okay. let me clean this up. my
[4734.46s -> 4757.99s]  bucket. still standing. that was weird. the bucket. potato rack. no, i need this over here.
[4757.99s -> 4774.36s]  give me the sponge. this is gonna give me, like, anxiety. i can't have that. i can't have, like,
[4774.36s -> 4793.13s]  blueberry juice all over the place. okay. up, down. i need another bottle of vinegar,
[4793.13s -> 4807.59s]  right? and then i can make the duck and we can get going. spatula, bring it back. all right.
[4807.59s -> 4812.20s]  this is looking a little better. is my salt and pepper? always put them right next to each
[4812.20s -> 4829.37s]  other. clean, clean, clean. why is there a blend in here? are we good? i think that's it.
[4829.37s -> 4834.73s]  now i'm gonna make the broth for the duck. one carrot, one onion. i've already salted and
[4834.73s -> 4852.76s]  peppered this, haven't i? i have not. are you sure? damn it. it's all right. no, i did. i did.
[4852.76s -> 4873.53s]  i did. didn't i do this? didn't i put pepper in there? do i need pepper in there? does pepper...
[4873.53s -> 4896.60s]  no pepper. okay, duck. it's two duck breasts. and that's it. and you start it up. yeah,
[4896.60s -> 4915.75s]  that'll be fine. Todd Howard is watching you play this on stage. can you imagine? didn't
[4915.75s -> 4924.25s]  level up. all right. is the critic gonna come today so i can finally do this? we got to fame
[4924.25s -> 4928.60s]  three and then it was immediately ripped from us. grilled tuna steak is the dish of the day.
[4929.75s -> 4943.46s]  you got it. it needs to simmer overnight. all right. tuna steak. let's get them out. salt them
[4943.46s -> 4976.63s]  up. okay. salt and pepper on every location. good. it's five and five. what's that? good.
[4976.63s -> 5001.22s]  good. good. put it on the ground. it hits... don't worry. it'll hit the ground. there's
[5001.22s -> 5004.18s]  plenty of time for this tuna steak to hit the ground. at least half of these will. two
[5004.18s -> 5013.06s]  out of the four will be on the ground. Todd Howard just said the new elder scrolls map is at least
[5013.06s -> 5018.10s]  five. at least five times as least... what are you saying? at least five as big as me? five
[5018.10s -> 5037.69s]  germas? shit. i just let this sit here like that. all right. hold on. fucking ruined it,
[5037.69s -> 5061.00s]  i think. how cooked is it? is it overcooked? it looks all right. you're wasting more duck.
[5061.00s -> 5067.08s]  no, i'm not. it's fine. let's get four or five plates over there and i can start the day.
[5067.08s -> 5093.43s]  i gotta get my tuna steaks ready. last one. i got my broth. just set them up in a row
[5093.43s -> 5107.90s]  here. we'll be good to go. we need more detail. all right. let's start pouring it. here we go.
[5107.90s -> 5120.09s]  the onion's a little burnt, but i don't think it'll be too much of a problem. be 25. 230.
[5120.09s -> 5133.72s]  as long as it's over 220. that's good. 290. that's a little over. 270. i can spread this
[5133.72s -> 5150.09s]  out a little bit more. that's good. all right. good. duck is cut. give me a plate. how much
[5150.09s -> 5161.91s]  time? five minutes. i can prepare the tuna steaks as well. slow and steady. don't explode.
[5161.99s -> 5166.54s]  all right. tuna steaks. these have all been salted. now i have to just grill them up.
[5166.54s -> 5179.80s]  i'm gonna put them all on at the same time. now give me a plate. transfer them all. what did
[5179.80s -> 5188.46s]  i tell you? this is at least one. well that one was dropped a double. we have one out of
[5188.46s -> 5204.63s]  four. i hit the gun twice. does that count? that's good. now i need lemons, right? lemons
[5204.63s -> 5215.53s]  into squares. four slices on each lemon. i need four lemons. get them on the cutting board.
[5219.03s -> 5234.58s]  excellent. four into fours. now i gotta move this shit out of the way. i can't do that.
[5235.06s -> 5252.97s]  there we go. these have to be good. they do. i should be able to get these. four.
[5253.69s -> 5262.78s]  what are you doing to me? oh whatever. that one's a little jacked up but it's fine.
[5263.42s -> 5296.89s]  all right. lemons are done. steaks. oh! oh! oh! oh! oh! saved. nice. is this cooking?
[5298.89s -> 5305.82s]  yes. all right. i also need how much... what do i need? parsley. i actually forget what it is,
[5305.82s -> 5311.74s]  but okay. now that we're almost done with that, i'm gonna get... my broth is already done. my
[5311.74s -> 5317.08s]  tomato soup. i have gazpacho. i have borscht. i think i'm gonna get a couple of these out,

[5327.21s -> 5349.88s]  um... give me a big plate. pepper, thyme, and dill. okay. p-t-d. pepper, thyme, dill.
[5350.68s -> 5359.05s]  well, i think it's gonna be perfect. tawd is beating up somebody in the audience. so
[5359.05s -> 5374.34s]  okay. sure he is. that one's not done. well, the edge of that needs to be cooked a little
[5374.34s -> 5383.51s]  more. okay. let's put this down. all right. now in the meantime, pepper, thyme, dill.
[5397.56s -> 5427.13s]  pepper, thyme, dill. okay. pepper, thyme, thyme. it's done. done. steaks are ready. now i just need

[5500.47s -> 5508.41s]  what everybody says? you don't think... maybe he just doesn't do social media. it doesn't look
[5508.41s -> 5532.55s]  at all when these come out horse radish. i need two of these. get it done. i can't even
[5532.55s -> 5539.99s]  imagine what it would be like to be like tawd howard. sometimes i open up my twitter
[5540.07s -> 5546.36s]  and like somebody will like draw a picture of me with like spit coming out of my nose and like
[5546.36s -> 5566.22s]  shit all over me. i mean can you imagine being tawd howard? people like draw me like five feet
[5566.22s -> 5579.18s]  tall like a clown and like puking and stuff. i can't even imagine. this is all cut. all right.
[5579.18s -> 5591.40s]  now i just need a plate. season it up. i need horse radish on this and then we can get out

[5631.06s -> 5636.79s]  there was a problem with the lemon quarters. what was wrong with it? it was fine. what was
[5636.79s -> 5642.95s]  wrong with that? seriously. you didn't like how it was cut? what the hell are you talking
[5642.95s -> 5659.40s]  about? i can get a plate. i'm just gonna get this ready to go and move it. that's salmon?
[5660.04s -> 5672.12s]  i don't have any salmon made. where's the parsley? i'm just gonna move this over here
[5672.12s -> 5678.62s]  because it's done. now i need the salmon, which is... i have two potatoes already done here. i've got
[5678.62s -> 5698.33s]  salmon fillet. just cook it up. easy. where do you go? go back to cod. what the hell are you
[5698.33s -> 5705.70s]  talking about? go back to cod? i didn't play cod. that's way too much oil, but it's all

[5725.70s -> 5730.79s]  potatoes. these are cooked. no, i don't want that one. put that one back. that one's dirty.

[5736.65s -> 5747.98s]  this one's good. if i don't want to use the horrible ones, i'm not going to. spatula,
[5747.98s -> 5766.84s]  where are you? tod's crying. what the fuck are you guys doing? what is wrong with you guys?
[5767.80s -> 5782.01s]  you guys are so excited for this conference. you guys are just so
[5782.01s -> 5791.88s]  raring to go. i'm sorry to say, they're gonna announce like a new hat in the elder scrolls
[5791.96s -> 5803.91s]  online, and they're reducing the price of like all in-game purchases in blades by like 8%.
[5805.03s -> 5812.31s]  that's what you're getting. and then tod's gonna sneeze into a napkin and turn it around,
[5812.31s -> 5816.71s]  and it's gonna be like the elder scroll 6 on it. it's gonna be like blood. he's
[5816.71s -> 5843.61s]  like got blood in his... i don't know why he has blood in his nose. serve it out.
[5843.61s -> 5850.10s]  is it weird? i kind of hope that he does. no, never mind. i was gonna just say something
[5850.34s -> 5860.20s]  stupid. he comes out and does like the pendover gym carry thing where he like talks with his
[5860.20s -> 5880.84s]  butt. all right, is the duck worth it? i think this is good. we remade the duck. nice. okay,
[5880.84s -> 5890.86s]  good. we're so close to getting that extra star. french fries and steak. i don't have
[5890.86s -> 5900.71s]  that ready to go, so we're gonna have to make it. turn the grill on. salt and pepper.
[5900.71s -> 5920.20s]  get it on there quick. good. all right. oh, i still have the potatoes, but they're junk.
[5922.12s -> 5925.88s]  these are so junky. hold on. let me see if i can cut these into fries and then salt them.
[5925.88s -> 5934.92s]  give me a plate. if i can at least make these look nice, then it should be fine.
[5935.56s -> 5942.84s]  let's go with this. how many should i get? like four or five of them? cut them into little
[5942.84s -> 5962.47s]  fries and then salt them up. this should be good. okay, give me the... wait, turn this
[5969.93s -> 5996.92s]  in the knife. i cut these into fries. is that not doing anything? why? all right,
[5996.92s -> 6027.45s]  why did that work and the other one didn't? oh, who cares? why can't i cut these? they're
[6027.45s -> 6057.32s]  not salted. i got it. i got it. i got it. i got it. enjoy. good enough. you guys have lost your
[6057.32s -> 6091.43s]  minds. tod did this. tod said that. tod did this. tod went here. tod has the flu. got
[6091.43s -> 6097.98s]  this ready to go. this should be perfect. and i need oregano. so it's four slices and then
[6097.98s -> 6113.27s]  oregano. i'm so ready for this shit. one, two, three, four, and then oregano. and i got
[6113.27s -> 6116.70s]  the duck ready to go right there, too. this should be... i might get to level three here. this
[6116.70s -> 6129.83s]  is gonna be level three. tod just todded all the tods. we're now tod. tod achieved. you're
[6129.83s -> 6136.36s]  getting a little... you're getting smurf here. how... wait, how many of these do i have to do?
[6138.65s -> 6156.58s]  two... two ducks? i have to do three. grab the other one. all right, back to back. let's see if
[6156.58s -> 6172.79s]  there's enough. two ducks. everyone's so excited. everyone can't wait for this. i can't wait
[6172.79s -> 6179.61s]  either. i can't wait to see. i wonder what they're gonna do. oh, fuck you, game. that's
[6179.61s -> 6210.44s]  such bullshit. that's gonna bring me down. oh my god. can just get this off the fucking table?
[6210.44s -> 6224.84s]  what the fuck? i wasted two perfectly good soups. give me a break. why? those are perfectly fine.
[6224.84s -> 6241.48s]  what's the last thing? one more duck. i have another gazpacho, don't i? yeah, i do.
[6241.48s -> 6258.12s]  finally, some soups. 150. yes, finally. level three. what's the last thing i got? gazpacho.
[6258.12s -> 6278.70s]  i already got it right here. i'm low on soups. another steak dinner. no tuna. it's gazpacho.
[6280.60s -> 6301.80s]  i like saying gazpacho. finally, a tuna. i just hear gas. that's not a good sign. one, two,
[6301.80s -> 6312.42s]  three, four, and then it is oregano. give me a perfect score on this one, please. i'll take
[6312.42s -> 6329.88s]  it. i love how rowdy everybody is right now over this e3 tod conference. i would have had
[6329.88s -> 6336.46s]  it too. that sucks. this sucks. i have to make that from scratch now. let me just do the steak
[6336.46s -> 6355.32s]  quickly. salt, pepper, get on the grill. i think people are more excited for tod howard to just
[6355.32s -> 6364.23s]  walk on the stage than they are about the games he may or may not be announcing. okay,
[6364.23s -> 6385.37s]  the french fries. let's just dump these for a second. potatoes on this. why are they all
[6385.37s -> 6402.68s]  falling off the plate? flip, salt. i actually kind of want to eat those. one, two, three, go.
[6403.24s -> 6412.71s]  okay, everything's good. this is what it is. this just burns on. all right, now i need to
[6412.71s -> 6418.89s]  make a... i need to make the borscht. onion, carrot, parsley, beetroot. i forget what it's
[6418.89s -> 6435.78s]  like. how many is it? i haven't made it in so long. it's chicken broth. 1,700. how's
[6435.78s -> 6443.82s]  this looking? almost done. and then it's salt, right? let me look at the recipe. 20 grams,
[6443.82s -> 6465.03s]  20 grams. oh yeah, i forgot. it's like ridiculously seasoned. the screen fell.
[6465.99s -> 6470.26s]  yeah. are you guys really trying to tell me that the titantron fell down?
[6471.82s -> 6490.18s]  thank god i have one more of those. but i'm gonna make this first. looks good. 20 grams.
[6490.18s -> 6497.48s]  this is so salt-intensive. people actually eat this? this is like a thousand milligrams
[6497.48s -> 6505.70s]  of salt per serving. it's like drinking salt. no, now i need... i swear to god. get the
[6505.70s -> 6518.30s]  fuck away from me. just get them away. they're like magnetic. god damn it. am i cooking
[6518.30s -> 6525.38s]  anything? no. nothing's cooking, right? all right. i need to buy another bottle of
[6525.38s -> 6557.27s]  shit. what a pain in the ass. salt, pepper, again. do it again. where's the salt? i just
[6557.27s -> 6583.03s]  had it. all right. this is parsley, carrot, five beets, and an onion. i think that's it.
[6585.05s -> 6592.49s]  cook it. go. what else do i need to get? uh, gazpacho. i already hear it. it's right there.
[6600.90s -> 6624.31s]  that's fucking crazy. he just ordered... uh, come on. hurry up. i got that. here,
[6624.31s -> 6646.84s]  i got an idea. it's already ready. new order of what? tomato soup? i'm so excited.
[6646.84s -> 6653.72s]  too many lemons? now that's the right amount of lemons. see? making some good money.
[6654.36s -> 6661.05s]  all right. how are we looking? onion. take it out. and this is tomato, right? yep.
[6676.49s -> 6677.37s]  is that the song that's playing?
[6683.77s -> 6701.85s]  uh, hurry. hurry. hurry. perfect timing. i actually have to take that out now. come on.
[6701.85s -> 6730.76s]  hurry. hurry. hurry. hurry. hurry. good. saved it. apparently it was perfect. all right. duck.
[6730.76s -> 6736.50s]  careful with this. duck broth. right here. that's the last one. hopefully nobody else orders it.
[6736.50s -> 6760.09s]  and hopefully that goes through. and i got the last tuna. hopefully... wait. where's the last
[6760.09s -> 6770.52s]  tuna? oh, come on. it's another duck. i still have just a full herring that nobody ordered.
[6773.59s -> 6785.96s]  i'm gonna pee my pants. i'm gonna piss really bad. i gotta make sure i pee before the
[6785.96s -> 6800.28s]  conference. what do we team on is what? duck. i guess i can just make it right now. i need
[6802.57s -> 6833.86s]  well, shit. you got it. um, i need ten ten and then one carrot, one onion. e3 countdown on the
[6833.86s -> 6848.20s]  screen. let's get it on the screen. no. i don't care. no. i care about e3. i just don't care
[6848.20s -> 6855.54s]  about the countdown to e3. i know it's gonna happen. that's one more extra pepper. that's
[6855.54s -> 6866.23s]  fine. all right. now i need parsley and a carrot. right? no. carrot and onion. and then
[6866.23s -> 6875.13s]  put the two duck breasts in here as well. and then grind it up. we good. i need two
[6875.13s -> 6883.45s]  of these. that's it. what the hell? what the hell happened over here? skipping
[6885.75s -> 6910.20s]  interconnecting words now. is this on? these are clean. yeah. give them up. what's been your
[6910.20s -> 6917.51s]  guy's favorite part about e3 so far? and i need full paragraphs. if what you write is less
[6917.51s -> 6938.65s]  than four sentences, you're getting banned from the channel. Todd Todd Todd Todd Todd Todd Todd
[6939.21s -> 6955.82s]  Todd. at least i can use these. anybody a Todd fan here? oh, i don't think so. i think you're
[6955.82s -> 6978.62s]  in short company there. all right. get that onion in. is one of these duck breasts not cooking?
[6978.62s -> 6986.26s]  no. get the onion out. no reason to have it in. the Keanu Reeves is probably my favorite part
[6986.26s -> 6989.78s]  of all the things they showed at e3 this year. when he came out on stage
[6990.42s -> 6994.18s]  and made the references to the game that i liked, i thought it was really fun. see,
[6994.18s -> 6997.86s]  i did a paragraph. i pretty much only needed to have like two or three words there,
[6997.86s -> 7000.42s]  but i told you you're going to get banned if you don't do at least four sentences.
[7000.42s -> 7013.62s]  i'm not going to get banned. you might. someone will. okay, take this out. i just need to do
[7013.62s -> 7038.06s]  the broth. get the duck breasts out. cut. serve. i've really been feeling indifferent
[7038.06s -> 7041.34s]  about e3 so far. i'm not really a microsoft fan, so the entire show just went past me.
[7041.34s -> 7044.38s]  yesterday i only saw the soccer football conference for the fifa game, and that was
[7044.38s -> 7066.70s]  the kind of awful not gonna lie. all right, let's broth it up. Todd comes out in a
[7066.70s -> 7084.70s]  terminator costume. they making a new terminator game? i'd fucking play it.
[7085.42s -> 7100.90s]  i wonder if they're still gonna be, whatever the game is, still gonna be using the telltale
[7100.90s -> 7118.15s]  engine from like 2007. we'll find out soon enough. all right, it's time. it's time to,
[7118.15s -> 7123.21s]  the critic is coming today. i gotta get everything ready to go. whatever the critic wants,
[7123.21s -> 7133.08s]  i gotta make fresh. i do have some bowls to put out. i got duck here because we're at
[7133.08s -> 7140.26s]  fame level three. i have a full halibut ready. i've got my potato crisps. let me get some
[7140.26s -> 7151.18s]  bowls out because i need the broth. i'm ready for the critic. need it. gazpacho. i gotta make a
[7151.18s -> 7159.53s]  lot of shit here, don't i? yeah, the boar should be fine. i can probably fit it into three or
[7159.53s -> 7172.84s]  four plates, and then i need to make some gazpacho. gazpacho, gazpacho, gazpacho. every
[7172.84s -> 7177.83s]  time i say gazpacho, some of you guys have like your veins pop out of your forehead.
[7181.29s -> 7192.23s]  calm down. it's okay. just relax. it's not worth getting upset over. like, when people call me,
[7192.23s -> 7196.63s]  like, okay, for instance, my streamer persona video game online media name
[7197.27s -> 7206.68s]  is jerma. jerma985, right? don't forget it either. i get called sometimes jerma. oh hey,
[7206.68s -> 7225.02s]  jerma! jerma! it's all right. what am i gonna, that's fine. it's too much in that one.
[7225.02s -> 7226.46s]  people have different ways to pronounce things.
[7230.04s -> 7232.52s]  i know some people are freaking out about pouring with the handle.
[7233.24s -> 7237.32s]  don't worry. it's all right. it's, you can call me jerma. you can call me jerma.
[7240.22s -> 7259.38s]  call me joe. all right, i need a bunch of, i need a bunch of the g one. i need to make a
[7259.38s -> 7274.90s]  little bit more jerma. that's good enough. take this out. hopefully there's not more than

[7285.08s -> 7292.07s]  again, with the same pot. i need more chicken stock if that's gonna, let's just see if it works.
[7300.62s -> 7311.69s]  these are all empty. why am i still holding on to these? isn't this how grandmothers usually make
[7311.69s -> 7317.56s]  the food? they use the same thing over and over again. no, that's still good. it's still
[7317.56s -> 7327.22s]  delicious. no, no, no, no, no, no, we don't need to go to the grocery store. grandma,
[7327.22s -> 7334.94s]  the beets are green. extra flavor. people eat cheese, you eat cheese. that's gotten mold on

[7356.87s -> 7362.49s]  you're happy you had the onions? are you glad you had the onions? are you happy you had the onions?
[7362.49s -> 7379.98s]  huh? are you glad you had the onions? all right, we still got time. anybody knows that that's a
[7379.98s -> 7385.85s]  reference to. you get 600 fucking million dollars from my pretend monopoly bank account
[7385.85s -> 7405.43s]  that i pretend to send to you through telepathic means as a joke. am i gonna say it? nobody
[7405.43s -> 7417.62s]  knows that. i don't think anybody knows. no, it's not from family guy. there's 6100 people
[7417.62s -> 7428.52s]  here. not one person knows this. it's not the simpsons. i'm not saying it again. well,
[7428.52s -> 7433.75s]  it looks like i get to keep my money. it was from this xbox conference. yeah, phil came out
[7433.75s -> 7437.51s]  and was talking about how are you happy you had the onions? are you glad you had the onions?
[7440.33s -> 7447.78s]  all right, what am i doing? uh, i got time. perfect. all right, uh, what was i making? uh,
[7448.34s -> 7453.80s]  this. no, this is all burnt. this is not even making the soup correctly, guys. it's
[7453.80s -> 7466.76s]  not gonna work. um, i gotta keep prepping. uh, gazpacho. gazpacho. get this right.
[7467.32s -> 7481.02s]  i'm walking around like an idiot. that's some curb your enthusiasm. yep, you got, hold on.
[7483.05s -> 7513.77s]  there you go. spend it wisely. and did i get it? didn't go in? 30 and 30, right? yes.
[7513.77s -> 7524.17s]  and then what is this? all right, there's supposed to be salt and pepper at every station.
[7524.17s -> 7550.28s]  there is. shit, i thought i didn't get it. come on, get in there. what? whatever. you
[7550.28s -> 7556.66s]  gotta get a new joke to pass the time. i'm not like a joke factory, guys. what do you
[7556.66s -> 7575.45s]  want me to say? i'm not like, i can't just produce. just turn the webcam on. no, i can't,
[7575.45s -> 7579.45s]  i can't just produce under fucking circumstance. i got, i've got, it's just gotta be natural.
[7592.71s -> 7597.16s]  you want to turn the fucking webcam on and start dancing? why would i ever do that?
[7597.16s -> 7614.89s]  what do you think i am? a vessel. ah, maybe, maybe in your, like,
[7614.89s -> 7638.55s]  fucking fan fiction. this is all burnt completely. that was loud. all right, so
[7640.02s -> 7643.48s]  i think i'm pretty much ready for the day. i got that. i'm gonna make up some,
[7643.56s -> 7651.53s]  what's the meal of the day? see, i dumped the hot soup all over me. don't, isn't that,
[7651.53s -> 7669.40s]  isn't that like a 10 out of 10 hysterical piece of human comedy? give me the bucket.
[7669.40s -> 7672.89s]  here comes the critic. i'm gonna impress the critic. and then at that point,
[7672.89s -> 7678.89s]  it's gonna be time for the bethesda electronic conference. we'll see what the fuck they
[7678.89s -> 7693.91s]  introduce. i'm so looking forward to it. my whole life has been leading up to this moment
[7694.63s -> 7700.71s]  when i get to see todd howard come out on stage, clap and go,
[7701.59s -> 7710.20s]  i can't wait. it's gonna happen. this first thing is gonna do. all right, i think i'm ready to go.
[7715.83s -> 7721.64s]  i am. whatever. i'm not gonna make the meat beforehand because if he wants meat,
[7721.64s -> 7726.47s]  it has to be fresh. i can't just give the critic the crap from the freezer.
[7727.19s -> 7737.70s]  all right, here we go. this is it. more exciting than e3. that was 916 dollars.
[7737.70s -> 7749.13s]  is that more than i've ever had? i've never received that kind of paycheck right here.
[7749.77s -> 7758.39s]  all right, we got some skills. all right, cheaper products, liquids, fame boost.
[7759.19s -> 7765.45s]  is it like a one where critics are less critical? taste tolerance is already up.
[7768.44s -> 7771.96s]  derpers and gourmets have their expectations lowered. is there a derper?
[7775.54s -> 7778.90s]  oh, i was gonna explain a dream. you're right. yep, yep, yep. i was gonna talk about a dream.
[7778.90s -> 7782.74s]  so i don't know how many of you other guys do this or not, but sometimes this happens to
[7782.74s -> 7788.02s]  me, and it happened like over the course of a few nights. so a few nights ago, i had a dream
[7789.26s -> 7798.30s]  that i broke my brother's golf clubs. i don't know why. i had a dream that i was golfing,
[7798.30s -> 7801.26s]  and i snapped the head off. i was trying to drive too hard, and i was really embarrassed,
[7801.26s -> 7805.50s]  and i was really scared about it. i was like, holy shit, this is bad. i just broke my
[7805.50s -> 7810.78s]  brother's fucking driver. it was like a golf club or something. so i broke it, and then i
[7810.78s -> 7816.70s]  woke up. and i thought that it was real, and after like two or three hours, it wasn't
[7816.70s -> 7819.98s]  really that real anymore. i was like, oh, whatever, that's weird. did that happen? did
[7819.98s -> 7826.47s]  it not happen? whatever, and i forgot about it. but like two days later, i had another
[7826.47s -> 7832.28s]  dream where i replaced the golf clubs. and it was so... like i went to the store and
[7832.28s -> 7839.06s]  i bought golf clubs, and i brought them back, and i gave them to my brother. so i woke up,
[7839.86s -> 7846.84s]  and i'm not kidding, i thought that i did a perfect like dream loop where i honestly,
[7846.84s -> 7853.61s]  to goodness still, even to this day, think it may even be real. like a day later. it was so real
[7853.61s -> 7858.09s]  that i broke the clubs, replaced them over two days, and i was going to text him, be like,
[7858.09s -> 7862.68s]  hey, like i replaced your golf clubs. i just want to like... you got them, right? i don't
[7862.68s -> 7871.90s]  know why my brain was going to text him that like this morning. you guys ever have like a
[7871.90s -> 7876.54s]  complete loop where you finish a complete story arc in your brain, and you thought it was
[7876.54s -> 7886.07s]  real over the course of a couple days? that may not have even been a dream. okay, here we
[7886.07s -> 7899.88s]  go. i definitely want that. you're just insane. you're just a freak. at least i replaced them.
[7902.25s -> 7910.42s]  let's go with less spices. all right, this is it. i fucked this up last time. bad.
[7915.48s -> 7923.58s]  you don't have a brother. espachos de... okay, this is... i gotta be ready. those of you that
[7923.58s -> 7928.70s]  don't know this game, if you don't give the critic at least a four star dish, he removes
[7928.70s -> 7932.14s]  almost 150 points from your score, and it takes like two hours to come back.
[7932.86s -> 7951.58s]  it's really bad. but i don't even play golf. i don't even do that. i don't play golf at all, ever.
[7951.58s -> 7960.81s]  all right, let's get right to it. i don't even need to prepare. let's go. of course,
[7960.81s -> 7963.13s]  it's pork chops. the thing... one thing that i don't have ready to be made,
[7964.22s -> 7970.12s]  but this is not the critic, so i don't really care that much about it. this is what? pepper
[7970.12s -> 7990.57s]  p t d, right? salt, pepper, and thyme. no. it's s b t. four four s b t. thyme. where is it?
[7991.21s -> 8003.86s]  that's... why is it not on my station? you all right? come on. what? what do you... what do you...
[8003.86s -> 8010.12s]  i just clearly did it. i clearly just put it on there. you gotta be kidding me. all right, 30.
[8016.50s -> 8021.38s]  these take a long time to get it in there. and then i also have the potatoes, right? yeah,
[8021.38s -> 8039.30s]  they're already over here. just gotta wait for that to cook. just stare at it. i got
[8039.30s -> 8049.26s]  one customer in the store. all right, whatever it is, i'm making it fresh for the critic.
[8049.90s -> 8068.15s]  oh shit, they have to be baked. they gotta be baked. just chunked up the potatoes. that's 11.
[8068.15s -> 8078.58s]  i keep making that mistake. i swear to god. it's all right. all right, chunk them up into
[8079.22s -> 8106.38s]  50 gram slices. i lose this knife every single day. is it on the ground? i can't cut it on
[8106.38s -> 8150.39s]  here. get out of the way! it's not the critic, i don't care. that technique's not
[8150.39s -> 8165.67s]  going to work here. good. all right. salt. e3? e3? e3? what do you mean e3? e3? in 30 minutes.
[8165.67s -> 8181.56s]  it's not right now. it's in 30 minutes. i'm not missing it. no, you guys, it's not even time.
[8184.30s -> 8202.33s]  the pre-show? why do i want to watch the pre-show? i am the pre-show! he's not wrong.
[8204.10s -> 8209.00s]  hey, what just happened to the view count? the view count just went to zero.
[8210.52s -> 8220.07s]  oh no, nobody's watching anymore. nobody's here. they all left. everybody wanted to go see the
[8220.07s -> 8239.93s]  pre-show. zero viewers. well, shit. hey, they all came back. did you? but how was the pre-show? is
[8239.93s -> 8251.22s]  it any good? i knew you'd come back. i knew you were gonna come back to this channel. come on.
[8251.22s -> 8274.60s]  i can't serve it on this. what am i doing? i gotta salt these. excuse me. yeah, we've
[8274.60s -> 8281.14s]  already talked about our e3 impressions. what more would you like me to say? what do i think
[8281.14s -> 8284.50s]  is going to happen at bethesda? you want me to give you my insider information that i don't have?
[8285.06s -> 8292.97s]  we've got to pay extra for the pre-show. you don't have to pay anything for the pre-show.
[8296.10s -> 8304.57s]  i would be happy if we got a game that had magic in it. like, with a wand. that's really
[8304.57s -> 8315.21s]  it. is this the critic? no. make sure you start screaming when it's time, because i will
[8315.21s -> 8321.08s]  forget. and i'm going to be late to the conference. all right, this is salmon. yeah,
[8321.08s -> 8337.85s]  i got potatoes already done. what's the big thing this year besides the xbox alexa?
[8337.85s -> 8355.42s]  was that it? what is nintendo going to show? new smash brothers person? cyberpunk? yeah,
[8355.42s -> 8363.58s]  but we've already seen them. is there anything new that we've never seen before? starfield. oh
[8363.58s -> 8382.04s]  yeah, they're making a starfield. i completely forgot about that. i wonder if they're going
[8382.04s -> 8393.19s]  to show any gameplay. you just activated my alexa? oh, i'm sorry. i forgot. i'm on
[8393.19s -> 8403.42s]  new speakers at full blast right now. how loud do you guys watch this stream? you guys
[8403.42s -> 8407.90s]  have like a subwoofer and you just blast it? does the low tones in my voice come out really well?

[8431.34s -> 8452.66s]  bethesda. todd just did a backflip. i bet you he can do a backflip. i really think he can.
[8453.30s -> 8459.00s]  he doesn't seem like the kind of guy that can do like aerials and backflips.
[8459.80s -> 8467.45s]  i don't know why i see him on a trapeze. he comes out in one of those like circus
[8467.45s -> 8479.24s]  onesies. he's like the kind of like trapeze kind of guys i think. he's a nerd. you can be a nerd
[8479.24s -> 8498.07s]  and still use a trapeze. i'm not sure what was so bad about that. potatoes? all right, here we go.

[8750.42s -> 8753.54s]  right, in the time that i've just been being a dickhead, i could have just done this normally
[8753.54s -> 8771.16s]  and done it correctly and had a normal amount of stars. i can't put this in. just finish it
[8771.16s -> 8790.97s]  in the oven. i already won. it doesn't matter. oh, jesus, there's a lot of other stuff here.
