[0.31s -> 11.09s]  So we're having a competition who can make the worst one.
[11.09s -> 15.26s]  Yes, the competition here is whoever makes the uglier person wins.
[15.26s -> 18.84s]  And in the comment section, please take your vote.
[18.84s -> 23.81s]  Whoever makes the ugliest, worst, disgusting character wins the hundred bucks.
[23.81s -> 27.35s]  Why is it always a hundred bucks?
[27.35s -> 29.15s]  Because it is a hundred bucks.
[29.15s -> 35.90s]  Why do I... Can I like plug my gamepad in? This is awful. This is horrendous.
[35.90s -> 39.74s]  Yes, that looks like it healed nicely.
[48.20s -> 50.20s]  Ow! My fucking head!
[50.20s -> 53.20s]  I just made myself an instant migration!
[57.20s -> 59.20s]  Okay, skip, skip this. Get out of here.
[61.20s -> 64.44s]  Everything's going black for a second. Oh my... Where are you?
[64.44s -> 75.30s]  What is going on? What are you?
[75.90s -> 78.90s]  Look how my sideburns match my beard.
[80.90s -> 83.90s]  Yeah, look real close. Look real close. I'm Schmiegel.
[83.90s -> 86.90s]  You really are. You got boobs, dude.
[86.90s -> 90.90s]  Okay, so in the comment section, go ahead and vote.
[90.90s -> 94.90s]  Who has the ugliest character?
[95.90s -> 99.86s]  Hey Jerma, wanna have a lot of fun?
[99.86s -> 101.49s]  Have fun.
[101.49s -> 102.66s]  What the hell are you doing?
[102.66s -> 104.66s]  Have fun. I'm never unpausing it.
[104.66s -> 107.34s]  Look at all your options.
[107.94s -> 110.94s]  Look at all the things you get to do. I'm leaving. Bye.
[112.94s -> 113.94s]  I'm done. Bye.
[119.01s -> 121.89s]  We've got dumb shit to do.
[121.89s -> 124.02s]  Is he really gone?
[124.02s -> 129.13s]  Star. What?
[129.13s -> 133.26s]  Oh, we have to go this way. This way. Get back in quick.
[134.26s -> 136.26s]  Before the cops show up.
[136.26s -> 139.26s]  This helicopter is really close to the ground.
[139.26s -> 143.26s]  Look at this helicopter. Look how close to the ground this is.
[144.36s -> 147.37s]  I'm wedged in.
[147.37s -> 149.37s]  Are you dead right now? Did you die?
[149.37s -> 151.37s]  No, are you dead?
[151.37s -> 157.85s]  No, I'm backing up and going forward. I think this guy is dead on my lap.
[158.85s -> 161.85s]  Where are you? Just get in the car.
[161.85s -> 163.85s]  Just get in the car.
[165.85s -> 168.79s]  Now I'm dead.
[168.79s -> 172.79s]  You're telling me the helicopter that was five feet off the ground crashed?
[173.79s -> 177.61s]  I got you. Revive your dead homie.
[178.21s -> 181.21s]  You're ugly. I don't want you to revive me.
[181.21s -> 183.58s]  Will you please get in the car?
[183.58s -> 185.58s]  You get in the car.
[185.58s -> 187.58s]  Before we can make our daring escape.
[187.58s -> 191.14s]  Or can we?
[191.14s -> 199.58s]  This guy right here.
[199.58s -> 201.58s]  I forgot you could do that in this game.
[201.58s -> 204.97s]  Come with me.
[204.97s -> 208.97s]  Star, you want to play a game called throw the guy at you?
[208.97s -> 210.97s]  What?
[210.97s -> 212.97s]  How do you do that?
[220.25s -> 222.42s]  You didn't need to kill them.
[222.42s -> 226.78s]  Fairly certain I just ruined everything.
[226.78s -> 232.02s]  Pretty sure I just ruined everything.
[232.02s -> 234.02s]  How do you buy shit? What do you fucking stop?
[238.87s -> 241.37s]  What?
[241.37s -> 243.37s]  That guy went through the windshield backwards.
[245.93s -> 247.93s]  Gas station.
[247.93s -> 249.93s]  Gas station where?
[249.93s -> 252.17s]  Gas station.
[252.17s -> 254.17s]  No, dude.
[254.17s -> 256.17s]  We needed to get gas.
[256.17s -> 258.17s]  Let's go. Fill her up, sweetie.
[258.17s -> 261.11s]  How do you blow up the same gas station twice?
[261.11s -> 263.99s]  I don't understand.
[268.62s -> 273.48s]  I think we got him.
[273.48s -> 275.48s]  I think we got him. What is this guy doing?
[292.31s -> 294.31s]  You gotta revive your homies, okay?
[294.31s -> 296.31s]  Calm down and revive your homies.
[300.41s -> 302.97s]  I can hear you clicking.
[302.97s -> 304.97s]  Yeah, you get him. You get him.
[304.97s -> 308.42s]  No, you get my guy.
[308.42s -> 313.08s]  What?
[313.08s -> 315.08s]  Can I do that again?
[315.08s -> 317.08s]  I have to see if that works again.
[317.08s -> 321.37s]  Wait, how do you?
[321.37s -> 323.37s]  You have to have a gun out.
[323.37s -> 325.37s]  Come here.
[325.37s -> 327.37s]  Hold on, I'm trying to get a hold of somebody.
[327.37s -> 329.37s]  No, you don't need a hostage.
[329.37s -> 331.37s]  Yes, I want you to hit both of us.
[331.37s -> 333.37s]  Fucking ass.
[336.12s -> 338.94s]  That's vicious.
[338.94s -> 341.75s]  So you hold control now?
[341.75s -> 343.99s]  Hold it.
[343.99s -> 346.62s]  You have to like count down.
[346.62s -> 350.65s]  Oh my god, there's another fucking fire alarm in this building.
[350.65s -> 352.65s]  I'll see you later.
[356.62s -> 360.07s]  Hopefully Star is okay.
