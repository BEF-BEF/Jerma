[2.49s -> 11.11s]  Oh, you're in big trouble. You're in big trouble. Wow.
[22.17s -> 29.18s]  The sea is still this morning. The fresh pine scent fills the air, and the shining sun beats down on
[29.18s -> 35.37s]  the newly crafted pyro shark nest. She will need to be careful though, for predators lurk around
[35.37s -> 41.82s]  every corner. The winter months are always the most difficult for pyro sharks, so the summer sun
[41.82s -> 51.11s]  gives them plenty of time for the necessary hunt. The food is scarce, and the coming months will be
[51.11s -> 58.39s]  grueling, but the incredibly strong will and sheer cunning of this young female might just help this
[58.39s -> 81.22s]  endangered beast to another spring. Our first journey begins in Lakeside. This small, quaint
[81.22s -> 90.02s]  pool houses quite a large surprise. Weighing in at over 12,000 pounds, the pool room pyro
[90.02s -> 97.40s]  shark is a wonder to behold. The graceful swimming technique known as unguntu has been passed down
[97.40s -> 104.23s]  from generation to generation. Now, as one could probably imagine, this particular breed likes to
[104.23s -> 111.37s]  be alone and does not take kindly to would-be encroaches. This pool is not big enough to house
[111.37s -> 118.98s]  more than one pyro shark, unless of course, he happens to be mating. Unfortunately, most
[118.98s -> 126.70s]  pool room pyro sharks do not make it out of this pool because of their own laziness. Frequent sniper
[126.70s -> 138.76s]  and spy attacks kill most of them. Hopefully, the others will survive. Welcome to the shock tank.
[142.26s -> 145.62s]  Oh, you didn't think that there was a shock tank in Lakeside? Well,
[146.26s -> 157.30s]  I mean, there is now. Here we go. I think I see some prey. You're just drowning. Get out of here,
[157.30s -> 167.10s]  sharks. These are sharkless waters. Got him. Got him. Swarmed him. These are sharkless waters.
[167.10s -> 173.74s]  I need the help. Oh, there's a lot. There's a bunch of people. There's a bunch of people.
[173.74s -> 181.69s]  Come on. Somebody jump in here. No, no. I'm getting shot at. Jerma, Jerma, Jerma. No, don't die. No.
[181.69s -> 191.72s]  You're my shark brother. So, how is our lovely two-foot swamp pyro shark doing, you ask?
[191.72s -> 200.71s]  As happy as can be. It is a lovely day and the forecast calls for clear skies and calm water.
[200.71s -> 206.39s]  Striking with ferocity and quickness is all in the pyro shark's repertoire. And their favorite
[206.39s -> 213.53s]  food source is the scoot. The scoot is so full of tender meat and morsels dripping with bone marrow,
[213.53s -> 220.06s]  it is the pyro shark's favorite. Next to, of course, probably his fin. The two-foot
[220.06s -> 226.28s]  swamp shark only lives to be about four years old. Time is of the essence. Spy checking,
[226.28s -> 231.61s]  food gathering, and territorial guarding need to be done quickly. They will spend most of their
[231.61s -> 239.43s]  few days in these sewers, so they need to spend them wisely. And what's this? A wild skilt showing
[239.43s -> 245.58s]  himself to our young little friend? This could mean more rations during the winter. Be careful,
[245.58s -> 252.10s]  young shark. The skilt is known to be a fast runner and could lead you into a trap. This skilt
[252.10s -> 258.04s]  seems to want to lead our little friend out of the water, which is very, very dangerous indeed.
[258.04s -> 265.72s]  Pyro sharks have trouble breathing outside the swamp, so another time, another day. Now,
[265.72s -> 273.26s]  this is a treat indeed. It's not often we get to see the sawmill pyro shark. We caught this one
[273.26s -> 281.70s]  during its bathing hour, drinking up the cool, crisp water, cleansing his sun-battered skin.
[281.70s -> 287.74s]  Sawmill sharks are a quiet breed, although highly aggressive. Their main source of food
[287.74s -> 294.09s]  is the solly bird. Solly birds fly from peak to peak in search of their favorite health pack snack.
[294.09s -> 300.65s]  The sawmill shark knows this and uses deceit and cunning to lay a goo-covered sticky trap in place
[300.65s -> 307.69s]  of the bird's favorite meal. Once the bird is consumed, it's back to the bath. And to spend
[307.69s -> 316.33s]  the rest of the day in relaxation. And before we go, do you remember that little skilt that
[316.33s -> 321.58s]  was giving our two-foot pyro sharks some trouble? Well, if there's one thing you need to know about
[321.58s -> 334.66s]  the pyro shark, it's very simple. They always get their kill. Always. So it seems this pyro shark
[334.66s -> 342.73s]  will continue on through the spring and pass her lineage down another generation. Take care,
[342.73s -> 346.73s]  everybody. Good night.
