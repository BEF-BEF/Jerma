[1.02s -> 3.19s]  Is that mine? Nah, that's Shibby's.
[3.19s -> 5.19s]  Oh, he's dropping it on Phat.
[5.19s -> 7.50s]  Oh, 3, 2, 1.
[7.50s -> 10.57s]  How do you see damage?
[10.57s -> 12.57s]  Hopefully Phat doesn't die first.
[21.66s -> 23.66s]  Wait, where am I?
[23.66s -> 25.66s]  Who did I even select? What? I didn't want this guy.
[27.66s -> 29.66s]  You don't get to pick. It's random.
[29.66s -> 31.66s]  Oh, it's random.
[31.66s -> 34.02s]  Alright, well you want a dynamite?
[34.02s -> 36.02s]  You see what happens right now.
[36.02s -> 38.26s]  5 seconds, Jerome.
[38.26s -> 40.26s]  Make him poop, bro.
[44.44s -> 46.44s]  I didn't even know what was happening.
[48.44s -> 50.44s]  Oh, the panic.
[50.44s -> 52.44s]  The 20 seconds isn't long enough.
[52.44s -> 54.44s]  It needs to be like 30.
[54.44s -> 58.65s]  Charlize Theron.
[58.65s -> 60.65s]  Charlize Theron, if I may.
[62.65s -> 64.65s]  I just butchered that name.
[66.65s -> 68.65s]  Charlize Theron.
[68.65s -> 70.65s]  Hey, don't shoot the wall.
[73.72s -> 75.72s]  Why are you shooting just me?
[75.72s -> 77.90s]  Chew up, son.
[77.90s -> 79.90s]  Oh my, you're dead.
[81.90s -> 84.26s]  Jerome is dead.
[84.26s -> 86.26s]  That was a bunch of BS right there.
[86.26s -> 88.26s]  Charlize Theron.
[90.26s -> 92.26s]  Fucking Jerome.
[94.26s -> 96.26s]  I'm so done.
[98.44s -> 101.06s]  Oh, by the way, for those of you wondering,
[101.06s -> 103.06s]  Orb is yellow, Shibby is blue,
[103.06s -> 105.06s]  and I'm red. If anyone is confused
[105.06s -> 107.06s]  right now.
[107.06s -> 109.06s]  I'm confused too.
[109.06s -> 111.43s]  You only have 3 seconds. Look at all...
[111.43s -> 117.96s]  No!
[117.96s -> 120.14s]  What the hell?
[120.14s -> 122.14s]  Come on, son.
[122.14s -> 124.70s]  Get some.
[124.70s -> 133.21s]  No!
[133.21s -> 135.21s]  What the hell?
[135.21s -> 137.51s]  Come on, son.
[137.51s -> 139.51s]  Get some.
[143.75s -> 145.75s]  No, you gotta get the crates.
[145.75s -> 147.75s]  Where's Puke? Oh, that crate is mine.
[147.75s -> 149.99s]  What is it?
[149.99s -> 151.99s]  10 coins? Oh, great. Thanks.
[153.99s -> 155.99s]  I only have 10 seconds.
[157.99s -> 160.23s]  How do you jump?
[163.05s -> 165.05s]  Get me out of here.
[165.05s -> 167.05s]  I don't know how to jump.
[169.05s -> 171.05s]  Worst player, NA.
[171.05s -> 173.80s]  How do you jump?
[173.80s -> 179.35s]  Oh, shit.
[179.35s -> 182.73s]  8, 7...
[182.73s -> 184.73s]  Dragon Ball.
[184.73s -> 187.16s]  Get Dragon Balled.
[187.16s -> 189.16s]  That was the...
[189.16s -> 192.04s]  Oh, great. That sucked.
[192.04s -> 194.04s]  Did I just do like 10 damage to you?
[194.04s -> 196.04s]  That was weird.
[196.04s -> 198.04s]  Oh, am I gonna spawn down there?
[198.04s -> 200.04s]  Oh, this is gonna be perfect.
[200.04s -> 202.04s]  I just have to figure out what do we have.
[202.04s -> 204.04s]  Dude, baseball bat me like a boss.
[204.04s -> 207.56s]  Who has the girl voice pack?
[207.56s -> 210.82s]  I'm using the Australian person.
[213.88s -> 215.88s]  What is this? I don't like what I see.
[215.88s -> 217.88s]  Oh, nice.
[217.88s -> 220.95s]  Nice job.
[220.95s -> 222.95s]  That was perfect.
[222.95s -> 224.95s]  GG.
[224.95s -> 226.95s]  Why?
[226.95s -> 228.95s]  Why are you getting all this free stuff up there?
[228.95s -> 230.95s]  This is the DLC bullshit that I talked about.
[230.95s -> 232.95s]  This is what he gets for the DLC.
[232.95s -> 234.95s]  MLG grandpa up in the top right.
[234.95s -> 236.95s]  Oh, what's this? Oh, what's this turret?
[236.95s -> 238.95s]  What's going on here?
[238.95s -> 240.95s]  What?
[240.95s -> 242.95s]  What the fuck?
[242.95s -> 244.95s]  My turret.
[244.95s -> 246.95s]  That is the best shit I've ever seen.
[246.95s -> 250.86s]  That's not gonna be good.
[250.86s -> 252.86s]  I don't know what all my options are.
[252.86s -> 255.86s]  You're gonna kill yourself.
[255.86s -> 257.86s]  Oh, shit.
[257.86s -> 259.86s]  The sheep, that's gonna kill you.
[259.86s -> 261.86s]  Oh, my God.
[261.86s -> 263.86s]  I don't know what's going on here.
[263.86s -> 265.86s]  You have to detonate it.
[265.86s -> 270.90s]  I think you have to detonate that.
[270.90s -> 272.90s]  Oh, shit.
[272.90s -> 274.90s]  Oh, shit.
[274.90s -> 276.90s]  Why did I tell him that?
[276.90s -> 280.86s]  I should have left him in the dock.
[280.86s -> 282.86s]  Well, I'm going to lose this match.
[282.86s -> 284.86s]  I think I'm going to win.
[284.86s -> 286.86s]  I think it's going against Orbeez here.
[286.86s -> 289.22s]  I'm sorry, Jerome.
[289.22s -> 291.78s]  You know who to shoot out here, Jerome.
[291.78s -> 293.78s]  Yeah, I know.
[293.78s -> 295.78s]  I know what I'm doing.
[295.78s -> 297.78s]  I know exactly what I'm doing right now.
[297.78s -> 299.78s]  What is this?
[299.78s -> 301.78s]  No, what are you doing?
[301.78s -> 303.78s]  Oh, shit.
[303.78s -> 305.78s]  Good choice.
[305.78s -> 307.78s]  Oh, shit.
[307.78s -> 310.09s]  No.
[310.09s -> 312.09s]  Oh, shit.
[312.09s -> 314.65s]  What?
[314.65s -> 316.65s]  I just killed myself.
[316.65s -> 318.65s]  Was that a cluster bomb?
[318.65s -> 320.65s]  It was a cluster bomb, but I'm an idiot and I threw it incorrectly.
[320.65s -> 323.64s]  I will get to you eventually, Chibi.
[323.64s -> 326.78s]  No.
[326.78s -> 328.78s]  Nice nosc, brah.
[328.78s -> 331.40s]  Oh, wow.
[331.40s -> 333.40s]  Wow, that was a perfect shot.
[333.40s -> 335.40s]  That aim, though.
[335.40s -> 337.40s]  That aim.
[337.40s -> 339.40s]  How did you get that right?
[339.40s -> 341.40s]  I don't know how you did that.
[341.40s -> 344.47s]  That is FPS aim right there, fellas.
[344.47s -> 346.47s]  Can I call upon the power of the rats in the background to come eat your faces?
[346.47s -> 349.35s]  No.
[349.35s -> 351.35s]  That would have been so funny if you had fell down.
[351.35s -> 353.35s]  Funny because you would have died.
[353.35s -> 355.35s]  That would have been so funny because you would have died.
[355.35s -> 357.35s]  It sounds so horrible.
[357.35s -> 359.35s]  Jump rope.
[359.35s -> 362.62s]  Oh, only a minute and 46 seconds.
[362.62s -> 364.62s]  Oh, you fall.
[364.62s -> 368.07s]  Hey.
[368.07s -> 370.07s]  Orb is going to win by default.
[370.07s -> 372.07s]  Only a minute and 15 seconds left.
[372.07s -> 374.07s]  You gotta do more damage to him, Jerem.
[374.07s -> 376.07s]  I can't.
[376.07s -> 378.07s]  Oh, no.
[378.07s -> 380.07s]  Yes, yes.
[380.07s -> 382.07s]  Get it, get it, get it.
[382.07s -> 384.57s]  Yes.
[384.57s -> 386.74s]  All right, here we go.
[386.74s -> 388.74s]  We got a game.
[388.74s -> 390.74s]  Get out.
[390.74s -> 392.74s]  It was worth it.
[392.74s -> 394.74s]  We are never playing this again.
[394.74s -> 396.74s]  It raises the water level, I forgot.
[396.74s -> 398.74s]  Oh, all right, so it keeps going.
[398.74s -> 400.74s]  I didn't mess up that cluster.
[400.74s -> 402.74s]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[402.74s -> 404.74s]  This is going to be it right here.
[404.74s -> 407.88s]  Oh, it screws it up.
[407.88s -> 411.53s]  Hold on, I got this.
[411.53s -> 413.53s]  Oh, yes.
[413.53s -> 416.41s]  Yes, yes.
[416.41s -> 418.41s]  Oh, you're so boned.
[418.41s -> 420.41s]  Oh, you're so boned.
[420.41s -> 422.41s]  Oh, dude.
[422.41s -> 424.41s]  If you draw, no.
[424.41s -> 426.41s]  Seriously, seriously.
[426.41s -> 428.41s]  That's no way. The game is glitched.
[428.41s -> 430.41s]  Rick, tweet somebody.
[430.41s -> 432.71s]  Tweet somebody.
[432.71s -> 435.27s]  No way.
[435.27s -> 437.90s]  No way.
[437.90s -> 439.90s]  Where's my cursor?
[439.90s -> 441.90s]  I cannot lose this.
[441.90s -> 443.90s]  Where's my cursor?
[443.90s -> 445.90s]  I'm waiting for players right now.
[445.90s -> 450.17s]  Where's my move?
[450.17s -> 452.17s]  This is going to be it.
[452.17s -> 454.17s]  I think you're going to both bounce back into the water.
[454.17s -> 456.17s]  It might not, though. The explosion is not that powerful.
[456.17s -> 458.17s]  Oh, my God.
[458.17s -> 460.17s]  Oh, that's it.
[460.17s -> 462.17s]  That's it.
[462.17s -> 466.17s]  Oh, my God.
[468.17s -> 470.54s]  Yes, thank you.
[470.54s -> 472.54s]  I can't believe it.
