[4.92s -> 11.40s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary and tonight
[11.40s -> 16.28s]  I'm gonna play as the Engineer. It's been a while since, but I don't even know how long it's been
[16.28s -> 20.92s]  since a proper engineer gameplay commentary. I have no idea, but it's gonna be using the Frontier
[20.92s -> 26.04s]  Justice. I've put a couple clips together where this one I get 25 crits in the thing and I go
[26.04s -> 31.72s]  absolutely insane and the next clip is on offense with I think like 13 or 14 crits, but that's what
[31.72s -> 36.12s]  I'm showcasing here and it's gonna sit in the background. This is gonna be an update video
[36.12s -> 42.44s]  on where I've been and what I've been doing and where have you been for like eight days. It's
[42.44s -> 48.60s]  been like eight days. You don't go away for eight days unless something important's happening, so
[49.56s -> 53.90s]  let me explain. The reason why I've been gone so long is because I've been working on
[54.54s -> 60.46s]  some projects on and off of YouTube and the one we're going to talk about today is primarily
[60.54s -> 65.50s]  the one that's off of YouTube and something that I need to do, something that I want to do,
[65.50s -> 71.40s]  that I've always really wanted to do with myself, but never really jumped at the opportunity to do
[71.40s -> 76.76s]  it until now and maybe me talking about it a little bit might pique your interest in you doing
[76.76s -> 84.10s]  it as well or getting involved in something like this in your area. Volunteer work. Volunteering
[84.10s -> 89.54s]  primarily for me at an animal shelter. I'm starting today, it is Tuesday, I'm recording
[89.54s -> 94.66s]  this video, so I'm going to be starting there today as a volunteer at my local animal shelter
[94.66s -> 100.50s]  to help out with whatever I can, whether that be walking the dogs, playing with the cats, feeding
[100.50s -> 106.10s]  the animals, maybe helping out a little bit financially in some places. We need five pounds
[106.10s -> 110.10s]  of this dog food. I'll go get it. We need 20 pounds. We need like two 20 pound bags.
[111.16s -> 117.54s]  That's what I'm going to start to do with myself for at least a few hours a week and the whole
[117.54s -> 122.97s]  point of me doing this stemmed from I had this epiphany in the shower. A lot of you guys I know
[122.97s -> 126.82s]  I told you about how like when I take a dump or when I'm in the shower I think about things
[126.82s -> 131.94s]  and a lot of you guys might not know. I mean some of you do. I don't even remember if I talked about
[131.94s -> 138.12s]  it or not. My dog Otto, you haven't seen a whole lot of him and there's no real reason for that.
[138.12s -> 144.78s]  It's not like oh Otto is in such trouble. He has seizures and he's had a couple of real big ones
[144.78s -> 149.26s]  that were really really scary scary things where he had to be brought down to the ER.
[149.90s -> 153.58s]  He's had to go to the vet a bunch of times. We're trying to figure out what's what's wrong.
[154.14s -> 158.54s]  He's okay though. Like don't get don't take this as there's something really wrong with my dog.
[158.54s -> 163.77s]  He's fine. He's actually lying down right here next to me. He's okay. But I had this epiphany
[163.77s -> 173.08s]  where I said man it sucks when you an animal in your house or something that you love you watch
[173.16s -> 177.80s]  it get sick or you watch it and when we were in the ER I watched dogs come in cats come in they
[177.80s -> 184.33s]  looked one was like limping it was just like damn man like how do I help that how do I do something
[184.33s -> 190.52s]  about that like at least personally for me it was something I needed to do and I always thought that
[190.52s -> 196.28s]  volunteer work I don't have the time for volunteer work. I can't make that time. I just can't do it
[196.28s -> 202.28s]  but then you then you realize let me look at my schedule here oh today wake up at 11 a.m.
[202.84s -> 210.84s]  check eat food at 11 30 or to check and play video games for six hours oh yeah that's good
[210.84s -> 216.52s]  that's busy work that's I've got that and go to sleep I just don't got the time I don't have the
[216.52s -> 222.25s]  time to do and that's that's where the epiphany came from. I love animals. I love working with
[222.25s -> 228.26s]  animals. I love talking to people. Why not? Why not give at least like a couple hours a week to
[228.26s -> 234.42s]  this? I don't know how it's going to go from here. I'm not sure if I'm going to be doing this more
[234.42s -> 239.62s]  closer to part-time in the future. I really have no idea. This is just a trial period for me guys.
[239.62s -> 243.30s]  I'm just trying to find more things to do and that's what I was talking about leave it like
[243.30s -> 248.76s]  throwing it to you guys like do any of you guys volunteer and if you do maybe you could give me
[248.76s -> 253.32s]  some of your experiences volunteering and maybe some things that I need to know going into
[253.32s -> 257.56s]  volunteer at an animal shelter or if you're going to volunteer at like your local homeless shelter
[257.56s -> 262.60s]  or something these are things that I am a total noob at and if you have any information on it I
[262.60s -> 267.08s]  would love to hear it and I'm sure some other people would love to hear your experiences as
[267.08s -> 273.08s]  well and we're trying to push positivity here right now guys I guess I'm trying to say if you
[273.16s -> 279.80s]  have time now I know a lot of people don't have time to volunteer you're working nine to five
[279.80s -> 283.32s]  every day maybe you have two jobs maybe you're in school you're in college and you just don't
[283.32s -> 287.80s]  you don't have a whole lot of time you're taking a bunch of classes or something this is not a video
[287.80s -> 294.28s]  to guilt trip people into volunteering at a anywhere please I really hope nobody takes
[294.28s -> 300.12s]  this video like that it's mainly just to say in general it'll probably make you feel a lot better
[300.12s -> 304.84s]  about things it'll probably make you feel more positive I've heard stories that volunteering
[305.48s -> 309.64s]  is so rewarding when you do it because it just makes you feel so much better about the world
[309.64s -> 314.52s]  and you're trying to make something happen you're trying to change the world in as small a way as
[314.52s -> 319.90s]  you might think it is you're still doing it and that's pretty much where I'm going to leave this
[319.90s -> 323.82s]  video I just want to do a little update on where I've been the last week and what I've been doing
[324.46s -> 329.82s]  I've also got a couple of secret projects that I'm working on that I really hope you guys enjoy
[329.82s -> 333.34s]  that's been kind of going through into the pipeline and there's a lot of things I've been
[333.34s -> 337.42s]  doing on and off YouTube like I said in the beginning this is one of them and yeah just
[337.42s -> 355.11s]  an update of where I've been and hopefully you guys what am I doing no seriously what the fuck
[355.11s -> 360.65s]  am I doing right now um anyways guys I'll see you guys all next time uh take care everybody
[360.65s -> 363.05s]  and think about what I said goodbye
