[1.46s -> 5.36s]  Hey, what's happening guys? Germa here with a live commentary.
[5.36s -> 9.84s]  Want to talk about a couple of things. This is really, really late at night.
[9.84s -> 15.52s]  So, I apologize if this server has bots in it, because it probably does.
[15.52s -> 20.96s]  I'm not sure. Most cases are pointing to yes.
[20.96s -> 27.09s]  So what I want to talk about is I want to talk about a new Q&A video that I want to do.
[27.09s -> 30.75s]  Because a lot of people are asking about it. I got a lot of people saying,
[31.75s -> 34.62s]  I want to ask you more questions. Are you going to do another Q&A video?
[34.62s -> 36.42s]  Or what's the deal with that?
[36.42s -> 40.92s]  So the answer to that is yes. In the comment section in this video,
[40.92s -> 43.92s]  I would like you to ask a question.
[43.92s -> 46.42s]  Oh god, here to this century.
[46.42s -> 50.84s]  Oh wow, he's still there. Oh, I got it.
[50.84s -> 53.34s]  So I want you to ask a question in the comment section.
[53.34s -> 57.84s]  Anything, could be anything. Just as long as, like I said before, when I did this before,
[57.84s -> 63.34s]  don't do any questions like, hey, are you dumb?
[63.34s -> 66.64s]  Well, because you already know, yes I am. Pretty dumb.
[66.64s -> 70.14s]  No. You get the idea, though. Ask a real question.
[70.14s -> 74.82s]  Something that I can actually answer that's not ridiculous.
[74.82s -> 79.32s]  Something like, oh, are you excited about Skyrim?
[79.32s -> 81.82s]  Which, not really, to be honest with you.
[81.82s -> 85.32s]  Oh, we got to get rid of that century. Got it. I got it.
[85.32s -> 90.56s]  But yeah, I'm going to start doing this on a probably bi-weekly basis.
[90.56s -> 94.06s]  Maybe once every couple weeks I will do a Q&A video.
[94.06s -> 96.06s]  Because I know a lot of you guys have a lot of questions,
[96.06s -> 100.06s]  and it's fun to answer them sometimes, so I'm definitely going to do that.
[100.06s -> 102.94s]  Okay, what's left down there?
[102.94s -> 107.37s]  What? Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Scout.
[107.37s -> 111.17s]  Oh, I would have had him, too. Would have had him.
[111.17s -> 116.21s]  I could have, the sniper killed me. Oh, damn.
[116.21s -> 118.91s]  What do we got here?
[119.91s -> 125.16s]  Because I can't sleep. I have problems sleeping, guys.
[125.16s -> 130.79s]  A lot of my commentaries, well, they're not recorded this late,
[130.79s -> 134.79s]  but a lot of my commentaries are recorded during the day,
[134.79s -> 141.30s]  and then when I can't sleep at night, sometimes I'll just do it, and goodbye.
[141.30s -> 145.80s]  Ooh. By the way, if you didn't know, this is kind of a, not really a tip,
[145.80s -> 149.80s]  but sort of a check this out type thing.
[149.80s -> 152.80s]  If you hold down your, oh, let me get, oh, my God.
[152.80s -> 156.10s]  Oh, that would have been epic. That would have been epic.
[156.10s -> 158.60s]  If you hold down the left mouse button, look in the lower right,
[158.60s -> 160.10s]  see how I'm charging the shot?
[160.10s -> 163.10s]  It goes really, really far the longer you hold it.
[163.10s -> 168.10s]  So just something, if you didn't know, if you weren't, oh, damn.
[168.10s -> 174.68s]  If you, that's a great screenshot right there.
[174.68s -> 176.68s]  Yeah, a lot of demo men don't know that,
[176.68s -> 179.18s]  that you can hold down the mouse button and launch it.
[179.18s -> 181.18s]  Let's see how far it goes. I'm pretty sure it goes really far.
[181.18s -> 184.58s]  So here's the maximum.
[184.58s -> 187.08s]  Yeah, pretty much almost all the way to the base of that rock.
[187.08s -> 190.86s]  Let's try it again.
[190.86s -> 193.86s]  And yeah, look at that. See how far away that was?
[193.86s -> 197.81s]  Leaves you pretty vulnerable, because I think if you hold it down too long,
[197.81s -> 199.81s]  if it goes the whole way, I think it just screws you up.
[199.81s -> 202.70s]  Let's see.
[202.70s -> 204.70s]  Oh, I guess it's a little, it's long.
[204.70s -> 208.13s]  It goes longer when you hold it a little less, I believe, though.
[208.13s -> 212.14s]  All right, let's win this. Eat that sandwich.
[212.14s -> 216.24s]  That guy's name is KillMe.
[216.24s -> 218.24s]  Oh, I got him. Come on, one more.
[218.24s -> 222.89s]  Ah, how did that not hit?
[222.89s -> 226.17s]  Oh, my goodness.
[226.17s -> 228.54s]  You know what? There is a sentry right here, isn't there?
[228.54s -> 231.53s]  That guy's me. You're me, dude.
[231.53s -> 235.66s]  Something over here. Yep. Got it.
[235.66s -> 239.12s]  There we go.
[239.12s -> 241.12s]  Wow, the sentry was still there.
[241.12s -> 245.61s]  That's pretty unbelievable.
[245.61s -> 250.54s]  So speaking of games and questions and stuff like that,
[250.54s -> 252.54s]  because it's so late, because I've got nothing better to do,
[252.54s -> 256.53s]  I'll just ask, do you guys want to see
[256.53s -> 262.47s]  Grandpa play Battlefield or Modern Warfare 3?
[262.47s -> 264.47s]  Because he said it's like his favorite game.
[264.47s -> 267.79s]  And he's really excited for Modern Warfare 3.
[267.79s -> 269.79s]  Grandpa was freaking out when he heard
[269.79s -> 272.28s]  that Modern Warfare 3 was coming out.
[272.28s -> 274.28s]  So I don't know, if you guys want to see Grandpa
[274.28s -> 277.65s]  give you tutorials on how to play Modern Warfare,
[277.65s -> 280.82s]  let me know, because I'll definitely just be like,
[280.82s -> 282.82s]  hey, Grandpa, what are you doing today?
[282.82s -> 284.82s]  He'll be like, all right, nothing.
[284.82s -> 286.82s]  Why don't you make some Modern Warfare videos?
[286.82s -> 289.14s]  Where am I going?
[289.14s -> 292.93s]  Oh, I'm going the right way.
[292.93s -> 296.43s]  He'll probably tell me to shut up and to grow a set of balls,
[296.43s -> 297.93s]  because he hates me.
[297.93s -> 299.92s]  No, I'm just kidding.
[299.92s -> 303.42s]  And for those of you, I'm going to spoil the fun.
[303.42s -> 305.42s]  For those of you that do not know,
[305.42s -> 307.42s]  that is a character.
[307.42s -> 308.42s]  That is not real.
[308.42s -> 310.42s]  My grandpa, that is not real.
[310.42s -> 312.42s]  That's not my real grandfather.
[312.42s -> 316.42s]  It is, in fact, me doing a voice for fun.
[316.42s -> 317.92s]  It's a character I sort of created,
[317.92s -> 319.92s]  and I'm going to keep him.
[319.92s -> 321.92s]  So don't think like he's never coming back,
[321.92s -> 323.92s]  and it's like, I'll let the imagination...
[323.92s -> 325.42s]  Oh, look at all these snipers.
[325.42s -> 328.18s]  Oh, my God.
[328.68s -> 330.68s]  That was insane.
[330.68s -> 333.68s]  That was insane.
[333.68s -> 336.11s]  Dude, there are so many snipers.
[340.19s -> 341.69s]  Oh, man.
[341.69s -> 345.19s]  So right here, I have an HL2EXE crash.
[345.19s -> 347.69s]  So let's move on to later in the gameplay.
[347.69s -> 350.82s]  Here we go.
[350.82s -> 352.32s]  Oh, what's going to happen?
[352.32s -> 353.82s]  Am I going to get headshot by a sniper?
[353.82s -> 359.31s]  They're all up there.
[359.31s -> 363.44s]  Ooh, that was pretty dirty.
[363.44s -> 364.94s]  Oh, boy.
[367.67s -> 370.67s]  Let's do a roll here in like two minutes.
[370.67s -> 375.02s]  I'm going for three lives.
[375.02s -> 376.02s]  I should probably start.
[376.02s -> 378.02s]  That would be actually a pretty cool series
[378.02s -> 382.52s]  if you gave yourself a certain amount of lives per gameplay.
[382.52s -> 386.02s]  Because you guys know how I do the one-life gameplays.
[386.02s -> 388.02s]  But what if I did a three-life gameplay
[388.02s -> 389.52s]  where I start at the beginning of a round,
[389.52s -> 392.52s]  and I say, hey, I only get two lives,
[392.52s -> 394.52s]  and then I have to stop
[394.52s -> 396.52s]  and see what happens, whatever happens, happens.
[396.52s -> 397.52s]  We are rolling here.
[397.52s -> 400.79s]  Holy crap.
[400.79s -> 403.36s]  My word.
[403.36s -> 404.36s]  Oh, a spy.
[404.36s -> 405.36s]  Spy.
[405.36s -> 408.64s]  Where is he?
[408.64s -> 410.14s]  Did he get killed?
[410.14s -> 413.42s]  No, he's right there.
[413.42s -> 414.92s]  Oh, my God.
[414.92s -> 418.12s]  Wow, do not miss him again.
[418.12s -> 419.62s]  Thank goodness.
[423.26s -> 424.26s]  People still on the...
[424.26s -> 425.26s]  Oh, boy.
[425.26s -> 426.26s]  Nope.
[426.26s -> 427.26s]  Oh, there's a sentry.
[427.26s -> 428.50s]  There's a sentry.
[428.50s -> 429.50s]  Need a medic.
[429.50s -> 434.54s]  Need a medic sentry over there.
[434.54s -> 436.87s]  Still alive.
[436.87s -> 438.37s]  Let's see if I can't do this.
[438.37s -> 446.94s]  Oh, God.
[448.44s -> 450.18s]  Oh, well.
[450.18s -> 452.30s]  Two more lives.
[452.30s -> 453.30s]  And then I'll end it.
[453.30s -> 454.80s]  I'll end it.
[454.80s -> 456.30s]  I can definitely take that out.
[456.30s -> 458.30s]  I can get that sentry, no problem.
[458.30s -> 461.35s]  I just have to not be a freak.
[463.97s -> 465.97s]  You are not one of us, are you?
[465.97s -> 468.99s]  Yeah, you are.
[468.99s -> 469.99s]  All right, I'll get it.
[469.99s -> 470.99s]  I'll get it right here.
[470.99s -> 474.52s]  Maybe not.
[474.52s -> 476.02s]  Oh, God, the crit came over here.
[476.02s -> 477.02s]  Oh, crap.
[477.02s -> 478.52s]  I can't even go over there.
[478.52s -> 484.68s]  There's one.
[484.68s -> 486.18s]  There's two.
[486.18s -> 489.18s]  Oh, smart engineer is smart.
[489.18s -> 490.18s]  And there's another one up there.
[490.18s -> 491.18s]  Ah.
[491.18s -> 494.45s]  Bastard.
[494.45s -> 496.91s]  I would have had it.
[496.91s -> 498.97s]  Because I would have been able to kill it
[498.97s -> 501.48s]  when he was working on it.
[501.48s -> 502.98s]  All right, this is my last life.
[502.98s -> 505.24s]  Last life.
[505.24s -> 507.38s]  Here we go.
[507.38s -> 508.38s]  Got to get up there quick.
[508.38s -> 513.29s]  Bouncing around like a ping pong ball there.
[513.29s -> 514.98s]  That one doesn't count.
[514.98s -> 515.98s]  That doesn't count.
[515.98s -> 519.48s]  That was Bolshevik.
[519.48s -> 522.82s]  All right, so this is the last life.
[522.82s -> 525.77s]  Make it a teleporter, too.
[525.77s -> 527.40s]  Damn it.
[527.40s -> 530.03s]  Damn it, damn it, damn it.
[530.03s -> 532.67s]  There we go.
[532.67s -> 535.96s]  Okay.
[535.96s -> 537.76s]  Don't get shot by a sniper.
[537.76s -> 539.64s]  All right.
[539.64s -> 541.14s]  Let's see what I can do here.
[541.14s -> 544.34s]  Oh, I just have to get...
[544.34s -> 545.34s]  Ugh.
[545.34s -> 546.34s]  You.
[546.34s -> 549.56s]  No, get these away.
[549.56s -> 551.70s]  Ugh.
[551.70s -> 552.70s]  I need a medic.
[552.70s -> 554.20s]  This is just not possible without a medic.
[554.20s -> 555.70s]  We don't have a medic, do we?
[555.70s -> 557.20s]  Nope.
[557.20s -> 564.20s]  Whoa.
[564.20s -> 567.80s]  Oh, get him.
[567.80s -> 569.56s]  He's done.
[569.56s -> 572.56s]  Oh, thank you Mini-Sentry for saving my life right there.
[572.56s -> 574.49s]  All right, what do they got up there?
[574.49s -> 577.01s]  Nothing.
[577.01s -> 579.72s]  I got that.
[579.72s -> 580.72s]  Okay, that's gone.
[580.72s -> 582.22s]  That's a major, major problem.
[582.22s -> 583.22s]  So that's okay.
[583.22s -> 584.52s]  That's good.
[584.52s -> 585.52s]  There's definitely a sentry right here.
[585.52s -> 590.91s]  Yep.
[590.91s -> 591.91s]  Gone.
[592.41s -> 593.97s]  Goodbye.
[593.97s -> 595.40s]  Spencer.
[595.40s -> 596.40s]  What is another one right there?
[596.40s -> 598.22s]  I know it.
[598.22s -> 599.72s]  There's definitely another sentry right there.
[599.72s -> 602.60s]  Let's see if I can't make something happen right there.
[602.60s -> 603.60s]  Let's actually...
[603.60s -> 604.60s]  You know what?
[604.60s -> 605.60s]  Forget this.
[605.60s -> 607.09s]  I'm going to kill like five people.
[607.09s -> 608.09s]  Or two.
[608.09s -> 610.04s]  That works.
[610.04s -> 611.04s]  All right.
[611.04s -> 613.30s]  I can get that.
[613.30s -> 615.18s]  I can get that.
[615.18s -> 616.18s]  I can get that sentry.
[616.18s -> 620.92s]  Let's see if I can't be a little freak show here.
[620.92s -> 621.92s]  Goodbye, sentry.
[621.92s -> 623.72s]  Get on the cot.
[623.72s -> 627.65s]  Oh, all right.
[627.65s -> 630.34s]  This last life was a good one.
[630.34s -> 633.30s]  No.
[633.30s -> 635.31s]  Blow up.
[635.31s -> 638.15s]  Oh, boy.
[639.15s -> 641.78s]  We need a medic so bad.
[641.78s -> 643.28s]  Oh, that's the last life.
[643.28s -> 644.95s]  Let's see if we cap it.
[644.95s -> 646.45s]  Just see if we cap it.
[646.45s -> 649.95s]  But in the meantime, answer your questions.
[649.95s -> 651.95s]  Ask your questions down below.
[651.95s -> 654.45s]  I will start that probably in the next couple days.
[654.45s -> 657.45s]  I'll do a video answering some of the questions that I pick from the comments.
[657.45s -> 662.38s]  And you can also ask it on my Facebook and my Twitter, which are in the description.
[662.38s -> 664.12s]  So here it is, the final life.
[664.12s -> 666.12s]  Let's see if I can do something freaky.
[666.12s -> 667.86s]  Here we go.
[667.86s -> 669.86s]  Demoman away!
[670.86s -> 673.94s]  And we're going to cap it, right?
[673.94s -> 676.63s]  All right, at least we capped it.
[676.63s -> 677.94s]  All right.
[677.94s -> 679.44s]  Thanks, everybody, so much for watching.
[679.44s -> 680.94s]  I really do appreciate it.
[680.94s -> 682.94s]  And I'll see you guys all next time.
[682.94s -> 684.94s]  Take care, everybody.
