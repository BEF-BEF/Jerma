[0.31s -> 17.53s]  Hello there, ladies and gentlemen. It's Grandpa here, and if you're wondering why I'm being
[17.53s -> 23.45s]  a little bit on the quiet side, it's because Jeremy doesn't know I'm in here. And I saw
[23.45s -> 29.13s]  him play this game the other day, and I asked him nicely if I could play it, and he told
[29.13s -> 34.25s]  me, no, Grandpa, you can't do that, because your heart is too, you're gonna have a heart
[34.33s -> 39.69s]  attack. And I told him, fuck you, and he said, fuck me, and then I said, fuck you to fuck me,
[39.69s -> 45.37s]  and that's how it ended. But I'm not supposed to be in his room, so don't fucking say anything.
[45.37s -> 50.41s]  If I hear any of you guys tell him that I did this, I'm gonna be really mad. But I wanna play
[50.41s -> 55.69s]  anyways, I think I'll be okay. This looks like a pretty easy level, because it's like all pink
[55.69s -> 61.30s]  and cottony, so I figured I won't get that mad at this. But let's just go, let's get started here.
[61.38s -> 66.31s]  Cotton Ellie. Okay, now, if I remember correctly,
[66.95s -> 74.30s]  you're supposed to jump over these shovel legs, just like this. God, this controller sucks!
[75.98s -> 82.38s]  Oh, oh no. Whoa, whoa, whoa, what was that? Are you all right? I just heard a crash. Are
[82.38s -> 87.50s]  you okay? What happened? Oh, no, yeah, I'm okay. Yeah, the seagull just
[87.50s -> 92.38s]  rammed into the window. It was ridiculous. What? He went full speed. He was looking at
[92.38s -> 96.30s]  me right in my eyes, and I said, you better not come over here, seagull, or I'm gonna get
[96.30s -> 100.94s]  really fucking mad at you. And he said, yeah, I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna bite you. And he
[100.94s -> 106.62s]  flew into the window and broke it. Can't believe it. Hold on, a bird flew into the window? That's...
[106.62s -> 109.58s]  Yeah. What is my controller doing over here on the ground?
[109.58s -> 112.22s]  Yeah, you did that. You must have done that. I didn't do anything.
[112.22s -> 114.78s]  You threw this into the window. No, this is not what you're talking about.
[114.78s -> 119.42s]  We live in the woods. There's no seagulls. Get up. Go get a broom.
[119.42s -> 122.22s]  I'll clean it up. Geez, what do you want? I'll get the fucking broom.
[122.22s -> 125.26s]  I can't believe you did this. You've never broken a fucking window
[125.26s -> 129.18s]  before because you're super mean boy. Everybody's done that for Christ's sake.
[129.18s -> 133.50s]  Thank you. Thank you for proving the reason why I banned you from this room.
[133.50s -> 136.49s]  What throws a controller into a window?
