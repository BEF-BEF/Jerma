[0.31s -> 15.32s]  So what is going on everybody? Welcome to FaceCamp Fortress Team, Face Fortress Camp 2.
[15.32s -> 21.93s]  This is something I did a while back and I want to do it again just because I feel like it.
[21.93s -> 27.37s]  So let's see, let's see, what do I got right now? Default loadout. I'm just going to run with whatever I got.
[27.37s -> 35.49s]  We got the back burner, the flare gun, and the default axe. What? Why is that on?
[35.49s -> 40.99s]  Oh, where you going? On blue, this is on bad water as well.
[40.99s -> 49.20s]  But yeah, I just felt like doing this again because it's been quite a while since I've done this.
[49.20s -> 54.20s]  I think it was like Thanksgiving. Yeah, it was like Thanksgiving since I did this last.
[54.20s -> 61.72s]  FaceCamp Fortress 2. Oh, this guy's got no idea. Back burner, back burner.
[61.72s -> 70.50s]  Let's go this way. Get that crate, get that, get that crate. Oh, no!
[70.50s -> 80.60s]  Oh my god, I'm still alive. They have two sentries like stuffed in one little area down there. That's ballsnip.
[80.60s -> 88.83s]  You know what? F the pyro. We're going Demoman. I'm going to take that stuff out right now.
[88.83s -> 96.87s]  Hey, ready? If I don't take this out right now, if for some reason I don't kill all those sentries, I will...
[96.87s -> 103.54s]  That's a spy. No, it's not. I will swallow a whole egg.
[103.54s -> 107.54s]  A whole egg I will eat if I don't take those out like right now.
[107.54s -> 117.31s]  Like I'll crack the egg and then crack it into my mouth. What? What?
[117.31s -> 128.35s]  No, I don't want to eat an egg. I do not want to eat an egg. I got to eat an egg. I got to eat an egg on camera now.
[128.35s -> 138.74s]  I don't have any eggs here with me, so we'll have to do that in a different subscriber video.
[138.74s -> 146.17s]  I shot five stickies down right on that sentry. Oh, it was a glitch. It doesn't count. It was a glitch.
[146.17s -> 151.47s]  No, I'm just kidding. I still haven't gotten that haircut I was supposed to get a long time ago in my last vlog.
[151.47s -> 158.98s]  That just didn't happen. Get out of town, buddy. Get out of town, buster. That's a spy up there.
[158.98s -> 171.10s]  Alright, seriously. Come on now. Okay, it goes down then. I shoot five stickies down there and it doesn't go down.
[171.10s -> 180.32s]  Come on. Oh, he's trying to build another one, huh? Nope. Oh god, they're spamming up here right now.
[180.32s -> 187.83s]  Is there another one down? Aww. Come on, let's cap that cock. Cap it, baby. Cap it.
[187.83s -> 196.82s]  So let me just hold on. Break. You know, I'm going to medic. Let's go medic with the...
[196.82s -> 203.25s]  What do I got? Syringe gun, critscreek, and the ubersaw. Take the damn critscreek off. Let's go with the medigun, baby.
[203.25s -> 210.50s]  I think we're going to cap it. I want the medigun. What the hell is going on? There we go.
[210.50s -> 216.88s]  I don't even think this is necessary. I think we're going to win. Maybe not.
[216.88s -> 229.38s]  Excuse me, sir. We got a cock to push over there. Mr. Jokester. Oh, we did it. We won.
[229.38s -> 238.20s]  Oh my god. Hey, we won. Maybe I'll do like another round.
[238.20s -> 243.20s]  So I have something to talk about in my next commentary. My next real sit-down commentary.
[243.20s -> 251.02s]  It's about something very, very important. Well, not really important. I just want to get your guys' viewpoints on it.
[251.02s -> 260.27s]  I'll save the topic for... I'll probably do it in two days. So what's today? Wednesday? Tuesday?
[260.27s -> 265.07s]  So yeah, it'll probably be up by like Friday or Saturday. But it's a very important topic.
[265.07s -> 272.25s]  And it's something that really made me very, very sad in the last couple days. And we'll discuss it when that comes up.
[272.25s -> 278.87s]  But in the meantime, I'm going to uber this pyro. And we're going to do absolutely nothing, probably.
[278.87s -> 287.33s]  Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him. Flame thrower. Flame. Flame thrower. Oh yeah. Denied. Denied. Denied.
[287.33s -> 296.96s]  Oh god. Woohoo. Run into that. Run into it. You bastard.
[296.96s -> 301.65s]  What do we got back here? Spencer? Sentry? Good. I can build it up on you, dude.
[301.65s -> 311.22s]  Come on, come on, come on. Only a minute and 47 seconds and we win this damn game. I refuse to lose. Come here. I got you.
[312.22s -> 319.26s]  You know what? For the remainder of the time, I'm just going to go battle medic. See if I can't do something fun.
[319.26s -> 326.86s]  Get out of town. Where is he? I'm bumping into him. There he is. Come here, you bastard.
[326.86s -> 332.30s]  Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'm being a terrible medic. I know. I'm sorry. I apologize.
[332.30s -> 340.30s]  You don't have to eat that sandwich. You got me, buddy. I'm your friendly neighborhood pocket medic.
[340.30s -> 345.67s]  Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. All right. Fine. You want to do that? I'll just smash you.
[346.91s -> 356.87s]  Oh, now I got a crits. Now I got a crits. All right. Drop it like it's hot, man. Down here. Here we go.
[356.87s -> 364.82s]  Shavoink. Get him. Ah, damn it. Oh, it's over. No, no. Do your right.
[364.82s -> 372.75s]  I can't talk over chat because if I do that, my game crashes because I have like three things going.
[372.75s -> 376.75s]  I got the webcam going. I got my microphone going and I have wraps going.
[376.75s -> 384.68s]  So like my entire world just takes like a dump on itself if I hit V. It happens all the time. It's not cool.
[384.68s -> 392.23s]  I think we got this in the bag, though. I think we do. I think this is all she wrote.
[392.23s -> 402.19s]  But yeah, thanks everybody for watching. I think this is going to be it. I will see you guys all next time.
[402.19s -> 406.19s]  Hold on. I actually can't say that yet because they just got two people on the car. Oh my god.
[406.19s -> 414.59s]  I'm here to save the day as a doctor. Get back out there. Over time. This is not good.
[414.59s -> 421.97s]  I was about to say my outro. We did it. I didn't get on the scoreboard. That's a bunch of baloney.
[421.97s -> 427.66s]  But yeah, guys, thank you so much for watching. We really do appreciate it. I will see you all next time.
[427.66s -> 430.66s]  So peace and take care, everybody.
