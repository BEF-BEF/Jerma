[0.31s -> 13.76s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a gameplay commentary.
[13.76s -> 17.76s]  I'm not gonna be honest, I have absolutely no idea what's gonna be in the background.
[17.76s -> 22.94s]  And I have to apologize because my voice probably sounds like shit.
[22.94s -> 26.94s]  And there's a reason for that, I actually just got back from PAX.
[26.94s -> 31.43s]  I slept an entire day. I haven't done that.
[31.43s -> 41.15s]  Let me tell you, I have not slept an entire day, like a full 16-hour period since I got diagnosed with Crohn's disease.
[41.15s -> 45.15s]  This has not happened in a long time. I was really tired.
[45.15s -> 52.15s]  For good measure, I had a fantastic time at PAX at a blast all four days in Seattle.
[52.15s -> 54.15s]  And I want to tell you guys my thoughts on some things.
[54.15s -> 60.58s]  First of all, this is gonna be pretty casual. My last video was a casual commentary as well.
[60.58s -> 64.58s]  But as you can imagine, I've been away for almost a full work week.
[64.58s -> 70.58s]  I've been almost gone for five days. So I haven't had a whole lot of time to make any content or do any real videos.
[70.58s -> 72.58s]  I had some things go up over the weekend.
[72.58s -> 77.76s]  And I do apologize for that because I like to get like three, four, five videos uploaded every week.
[77.76s -> 80.76s]  And I'm gonna get back into it today. I actually have a lot of things planned.
[80.76s -> 87.76s]  So stay tuned. And before I forget about it, while I was at PAX, I passed 150,000 subscribers.
[87.76s -> 95.19s]  So huge thank you, everybody. It seems like just yesterday I was at 100,000 subscribers.
[95.19s -> 100.19s]  And I just woke up one day, looked at the thing, and I was like, wow, we're at 150,000 subscribers right now.
[100.19s -> 105.43s]  That's unbelievable. And it's happening faster. My channel's growing.
[105.43s -> 111.61s]  It's crazy, guys. It really is. I can't thank you all enough for everything you do for this channel.
[111.61s -> 117.61s]  Every day when I wake up and I look at how many views or how many likes or how much my channel's grown,
[117.61s -> 123.30s]  it's one of the most humbling experiences of my entire life is doing this YouTube thing.
[123.30s -> 126.60s]  It's one of the reasons why I like meeting you guys so much.
[126.60s -> 130.60s]  Like the guys at PAX Prime, there was a couple dozen of you guys that ended up flagging me down.
[130.60s -> 136.60s]  We did a couple little meetups. It's awesome to see you guys face to face and what you guys look like,
[136.60s -> 141.60s]  how you guys act, what you guys think about games and where you're from and how you got there, how you're going home.
[142.60s -> 150.60s]  I love that shit so much. So if you ever see me at an event or on the street, just come say hello.
[150.60s -> 154.60s]  I will talk to you for as long as I can. And that means a lot to me.
[154.60s -> 158.60s]  So we're going to move on from that, though, guys. Thank you all so much again for 150k.
[158.60s -> 163.60s]  And we're going to talk about PAX. We're going to talk about the things at PAX that I really liked
[163.60s -> 169.60s]  and the things at PAX that I really didn't like. And we'll start with the good news and the bad news.
[169.60s -> 174.21s]  We'll start with the bad news first. Mugenics was not playable.
[174.21s -> 180.21s]  Mugenics had a very, very stuffed in the corner, like pretend we're not here booth at PAX Prime.
[180.21s -> 185.21s]  And that was one of the most saddening things of the entire weekend for me because a lot of you guys know
[185.21s -> 189.21s]  I was so excited for Mugenics. I was so happy to see that they were going to bring it out there.
[189.21s -> 193.21s]  Maybe they were going to show some stuff. It was going to be like playable or it was going to be cool.
[193.21s -> 200.58s]  No. The only thing they really had there was T-shirts and Super Meat Boy on two or three computers
[200.58s -> 205.58s]  in the back of their booth. That was really it. They showed a little teaser trailer, like a little cinematic
[205.58s -> 210.58s]  for Mugenics, and they had a big cutout post thing where you could put your face in a cat's ass.
[210.58s -> 215.58s]  And that's funny and all, but I wanted to really play it. I wanted to talk to them about the development of the game.
[215.58s -> 219.58s]  I wanted to really put myself in their shoes, and I really wanted to play the game, but I couldn't play it
[219.58s -> 222.39s]  because I wasn't playable. You get the idea.
[222.39s -> 230.27s]  For the good, I will say my top few things at PAX are definitely in the top three, at least WildStar.
[230.27s -> 237.27s]  WildStar looks like it's going to be fantastic. I didn't get a chance to play it because the problem with MMOs
[237.27s -> 244.58s]  at a big gaming event like a PAX or like an E3 or something like that, it's really difficult to get on one of those machines
[244.58s -> 249.58s]  because people get really invested. They get sucked into it. They want to play more. They want to get more into it,
[249.58s -> 255.58s]  and they don't leave the machine for like 20 or 30 minutes when there's people behind them wanting to play.
[255.58s -> 261.58s]  So here's my advice. What I suggest to any developers or anybody, it doesn't matter if it's an MO or an action game,
[261.58s -> 267.82s]  FPS, doesn't matter. Bring back the, it's-a-me, Mario. Thank you for playing. Goodbye.
[267.82s -> 271.99s]  Do you remember that screen? How many of you guys remember going to GameStop or going to Blockbuster
[271.99s -> 276.99s]  and sitting and playing one of the consoles they had set up, and after you played for like five or 10 minutes,
[276.99s -> 281.99s]  the game would turn off and you'd get that screen with Mario telling you to get the fuck out of the line.
[281.99s -> 288.99s]  Like that thing has to come back for all these events. And you could kind of include this into things I didn't like about PAX
[288.99s -> 295.99s]  because that type of screen, that like Mario get out of line screen, should be on all these machines at PAX.
[295.99s -> 303.49s]  It really should be. But regardless of that, I highly suggest you keep an eye on WildStar and sign up for that beta.
[303.49s -> 309.49s]  If you're into MMOs, it's very action-oriented. No more of this just like stand still and auto-attack people.
[309.49s -> 314.49s]  No, that's not the combat of this game. It's a lot more fluid, a lot more skillshots.
[314.49s -> 319.49s]  It seems like a lot more fun than really anything on the market right now.
[319.49s -> 324.49s]  So keep an eye on it. Go sign up for the beta because it's hard to frigging get into that beta.
[324.49s -> 328.49s]  And you want to be on that list early. So when they include a lot of people, you'll be on it.
[328.49s -> 334.11s]  Other than WildStar though, I'd probably tell you to keep your eye on Titanfall.
[334.11s -> 342.11s]  You've probably heard plenty of people talk about this game already, but I was so misinformed about this game, it's not even funny.
[342.11s -> 347.11s]  First of all, I thought it was only on Xbox One. Eh, that's wrong. It's on PC as well.
[347.11s -> 353.11s]  Second of all, I thought it was a single-player game with like a multiplayer afterthought. Eh, that's also wrong.
[353.11s -> 360.11s]  It's multiplayer only, kind of like a Team Fortress 2 where the whole game from the ground up is only for multiplayer.
[360.11s -> 365.11s]  It's cool, it's crazy, it's mech suits. It's a lot different than what you're used to.
[365.11s -> 373.93s]  This is not like Call of Duty 7 Black Ops Ghosts vs. the Ghosts and 2 Train Warfare.
[373.93s -> 378.93s]  No, this is completely different and I can't wait for more information about this game.
[378.93s -> 387.30s]  I wish I got a chance to play it, but I didn't and I'm very, very unfortunately mad that I did not get a chance to sit in line and wait for...
[387.30s -> 392.30s]  And I didn't get to do it. But what is cool about that game is...
[392.30s -> 398.73s]  Yay! Okay, what? Okay, let's move on. So, we're going to talk about one more thing.
[398.73s -> 403.16s]  Well, actually two more things that I thought were really interesting in packs.
[403.16s -> 409.16s]  And they're both indie games. If you're into indie games, then put the cone up to your ear like an old person back in like the 1800s.
[409.16s -> 416.34s]  And listen to this. So, Octodad 2. Well, not really Octodad 2, but Octodad Deadliest Catch.
[416.34s -> 420.34s]  Looks like a great game. It's got a brand new revamped graphics engine.
[420.34s -> 423.34s]  Got a bunch of new things to do as the Octopus Father.
[423.34s -> 428.34s]  And I've played almost that whole game on this channel. So when that game actually releases, I'm going to be playing a lot of it.
[428.34s -> 433.51s]  So keep your eye on that one. Also for indie stuff, Wasteland Kings.
[433.51s -> 436.51s]  Not sure if you guys have heard of this, but it's by the Vlambeer guys.
[437.51s -> 442.51s]  I did a couple of Vlambeer games on this channel. I did Radical Fishing. Well, Ridiculous Fishing and Super Crate Box.
[442.51s -> 449.69s]  It's the same guys. It's this crazy like top-down rogue-like shooter where you have like a ton of different weapons and upgrades.
[449.69s -> 455.69s]  It looks... That's actually a prototype. I'm going to put in the description a link to the prototype of the game.
[455.69s -> 458.69s]  It's free. And you can check it out for yourself and see what you think about that.
[458.69s -> 461.69s]  But other than that, I kind of want to wrap this video up. I don't want to get too long.
[461.69s -> 467.69s]  I do want to say a very, very heartfelt thank you for 150,000 subscribers, guys.
[467.69s -> 474.69s]  And I'm very tired. You could probably already tell this right now. I'm living on caffeine this last couple of days.
[474.69s -> 477.69s]  So I'm probably going to go back and lie down after recording this video.
[477.69s -> 480.86s]  But stay tuned for more stuff. I've got like a frog in my throat right now.
[480.86s -> 484.86s]  But I'm not going to redo this video, so I'm going to get progressively worse.
[484.86s -> 487.86s]  But anyways, guys, thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[487.86s -> 492.86s]  And I'll see you all next time. And of course, take care, everybody.
