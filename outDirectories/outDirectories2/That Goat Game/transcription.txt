[0.31s -> 47.51s]  My legs are so weak, I really need to strengthen them on the treadmill.
[47.51s -> 56.45s]  The Tower of the Goat was once key to the treasure of the gold buried underneath. Mortimus, the
[56.45s -> 66.10s]  grey goat, held the tea to the tower for generations. And Excalibur, the black and white goat.
[66.10s -> 76.88s]  What? Somebody on the computer over there? What's that? They're eating dinner? Hi. Hi,
[76.88s -> 89.92s]  I'm Mr. Goat. I hope you're enjoying your dinner. This game is amazing. Trampoline,
[89.92s -> 95.08s]  baby. I used to have one of these in my backyard. Want to see what I used to do in the trampoline,
[96.21s -> 103.28s]  I'm going very high. Hold on, this does not seem to be right. Nobody can really jump this
[103.28s -> 112.86s]  high on a trampoline. Catch me! Catch me please! Help! Not gonna invite me to your backyard party?
[112.86s -> 124.08s]  I'll show you. I wanted the hot dogs. What? I was trying to kick the thing over there and it didn't
[124.20s -> 135.03s]  work. You know what? It is gonna work. I'll make it work. He's flying. He's flying. And he's on fire.
[135.03s -> 142.98s]  Oh. And these people are all still dancing. Do you see what just happened to the guy that was
[142.98s -> 152.26s]  hosting the event? And what kind of dance is this? I've never seen anybody do this dance,
[152.26s -> 157.86s]  unless you were a toddler. These people are doing the I'm a toddler learning how to dance
[157.90s -> 166.81s]  to like Mickey Mouse music. Honey, can you just go check on the greenhouse and make sure my
[166.81s -> 173.76s]  petunias are in line? Oh, sure thing, honey. Oh, the glass doesn't break. I've got your
[173.76s -> 184.26s]  favorite breakfast cereal waiting for you. It's Pop-Tarts! Oh, Pop-Tarts! Where are they? I hate
[184.26s -> 188.66s]  going grocery shopping. I always have to go grocery shopping. This stuff sucks. I'm gonna
[188.66s -> 192.42s]  get Coca-Cola Classic. That's like my favorite. And I'm gonna get Doritos,
[192.42s -> 199.82s]  Spanada chips. Those are good too. I also want, what else do I want? I guess I could use a little
[199.82s -> 206.26s]  bit of ham. Do they have ham here? I don't even know. Maybe. Excuse me, sir, do you have ham? Oh,
[206.26s -> 216.74s]  he's not here anymore. Oh, she's dead. Frodo, you must take the goblins out of the cave of mystery,
[216.74s -> 224.58s]  and you must, you shall not pass into it fast enough. You could go first, because best friends
[224.58s -> 237.36s]  let their best friends go first on the slide. Okay, have fun. Have fun on the slide. Whee,
[237.36s -> 252.68s]  this is so much fun. Oh, whoa, sorry. I'm sorry. I'll pay for that. I'll pay for that. I'll make
[252.68s -> 259.00s]  sure you get like an extra monitor, a 27-incher, not just a 22-incher, whatever that is. Who are
[259.00s -> 266.34s]  you, Bill? How's life? How's the kids? Yeah, the kids are good, huh? Yeah, that's great. Everybody
[266.34s -> 273.12s]  expects me to just trash this place. But you know what? I think I'm gonna have some self-control,
[273.12s -> 281.78s]  because I could just trash this place right now, and it's really starting to build up,
[281.78s -> 288.83s]  and I really want to do it. But I think I'm gonna hold back just a little bit right now.
[288.83s -> 309.95s]  Get out before I change my mind. Hello, sir. Welcome to the goat station. Did I tell you
[309.95s -> 321.94s]  that today was baseball day at the gas station? Thank you for coming. Hey, Mortimer, welcome to
[321.98s -> 331.42s]  the party. Hey, Frank, how are you? What are you cooking on the grill? We've got some various meats
[331.42s -> 339.06s]  that we are cooking here on the grill. That better not be goat meat. If it's goat meat,
[339.06s -> 349.35s]  I'll be upset with you. Well, it is lamb. My family, we eat lamb. Same difference. Come here.
[349.35s -> 369.50s]  Come here. Oh, Lee. This is like Katamari Damacy. How much stuff can I pick up? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
