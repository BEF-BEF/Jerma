[0.31s -> 14.06s]  Hey, what's going on guys? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[14.06s -> 21.06s]  And Otto, my dog, is right here. I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to other people. What are you doing?
[21.06s -> 25.06s]  Anyways, playing as the Pyro tonight with the Reserve Shooter.
[25.06s -> 30.06s]  And we're going to talk about this weapon, we're going to break it down, we're going to discuss why you should use it,
[30.06s -> 33.06s]  the mentality you should be in when you use it.
[33.06s -> 40.06s]  And before we get right into this here, I'm not using the degreaser, I'm using the default flamethrower.
[40.06s -> 44.06s]  And a lot of people right off the bat are going to go, what the hell are you doing?
[44.06s -> 49.23s]  Put on the degreaser, why are you using the regular flamethrower? My god, I'm going to punch you.
[49.23s -> 56.41s]  Well, here's the reason. When I put on the degreaser in the Reserve Shooter, I don't know, leave me a comment if you get this as well,
[56.41s -> 61.41s]  a lot of times I'll try to compression blast somebody and quick switch over to the Reserve Shooter,
[61.41s -> 66.41s]  and I don't compression blast them at all, I just switch right over to the Reserve Shooter and nothing happens.
[66.41s -> 71.58s]  And I feel like I'm glitching out the game or something where I'm trying to do it too fast and it's in my head.
[71.58s -> 76.58s]  So I figured, okay, I'm going to go to the regular flamethrower, take my time with this,
[76.58s -> 80.58s]  just get them in the air and then switch and try and get one shot off.
[80.58s -> 82.58s]  And it seems to be working quite well for me.
[82.58s -> 89.82s]  And something I was thinking about, especially when I started watching this game playback, is why am I lighting people on fire?
[89.82s -> 97.13s]  Is there really a reason for that? Because for the most part, as you'll see, all of my kills come from one or two shots from the Reserve Shooter.
[97.13s -> 101.30s]  So why am I doing that extra light them on fire, blow them up, light them on fire?
[101.30s -> 104.54s]  Because that's really just wasting another compression blast.
[104.54s -> 112.54s]  Now maybe it would be worth looking into to not use your flamethrower at all, and the only reason you ever use it is to right click.
[112.54s -> 117.54s]  Now that may or may not work that well, but I think I want to give it a try the next time I do this.
[117.54s -> 120.54s]  Although you do lose that dot damage, that's kind of bad.
[120.54s -> 127.54s]  But at the same time, you're not going to be needing to scramble around looking for ammo crates or dispensers as much as you used to.
[127.54s -> 132.54s]  Because you'll probably get two or three extra compression blasts if you don't use the flame.
[132.54s -> 136.98s]  All right, so let's get into the most important part of this video, really.
[136.98s -> 139.98s]  The shotgun versus the Reserve Shooter.
[139.98s -> 144.22s]  So guys, right off the bat, both of these are shotguns.
[144.22s -> 151.22s]  They both have the same function times, they both act the same way, except of course they have a little bit different clip size, I'm sure you know.
[151.22s -> 156.22s]  And the quicker switches between different weapons or items with the Reserve Shooter.
[156.22s -> 161.76s]  Now that out of the way, think of the Reserve Shooter as a double-barreled shotgun.
[161.76s -> 166.50s]  And what do I mean by that? Pretty much I'm talking about pellet spread.
[166.50s -> 169.50s]  Now let's really break this down for a second here.
[169.50s -> 175.50s]  If I launch somebody in the air, on average with the Reserve Shooter, I'm probably, depending on where they're standing,
[175.50s -> 181.86s]  I'm probably going to do 40 to 80, maybe 50 to 80 damage if I'm good and close or at medium range.
[181.86s -> 190.28s]  Now if I do the same thing with the shotgun, you're talking maybe 25 to 40 damage from medium range, medium close range.
[190.28s -> 196.28s]  So really it's going to take two shots from your shotgun to equal one of the Reserve Shooter mini crits.
[196.28s -> 203.28s]  So that's why I say it's sort of like a double-barreled shotgun, and that totally, 100% relies on pellet spread.
[203.28s -> 208.28s]  Because on paper, on no bullet spread servers, it's going to be quite different.
[208.28s -> 213.28s]  But because there is spread in this game, you're never going to see the same numbers over and over again.
[213.28s -> 218.52s]  Now this would not be the case at all if they had different pellet spread mechanics.
[218.52s -> 225.52s]  But like I said in the beginning, they're both the exact same shotguns with just a little bit different tweaking here and there.
[225.52s -> 233.95s]  So if you put yourself in the position to think that this is a double-barreled shotgun, in your mind there's really six shots.
[233.95s -> 238.95s]  You only get to shoot three times, but you're shooting six bullets. That's what goes on in my brain.
[238.95s -> 243.95s]  And it really does help you out because instead of just freaking out going, there's only three shots, I can't hit anybody,
[243.95s -> 251.95s]  just slow down a little bit, launch somebody in the air, get that one shot on them, tell yourself in your brain that you just shot two,
[251.95s -> 255.95s]  that's a double-barreled shotgun, of course, I just did double damage, extra damage.
[255.95s -> 258.95s]  And you aren't doing extra damage, you aren't doing double damage.
[258.95s -> 264.95s]  Well technically you are, because what is it, a mini-crit 130% or 30% extra or something like that.
[264.95s -> 267.95s]  But it's the pellet spread that allows you to think like that.
[267.95s -> 277.38s]  Now where this shotgun really, really is not good is if you are missing pellets or you're not a great shot with your shotgun.
[277.38s -> 284.38s]  Because if you miss once or you miss twice, it's like missing four or five times with the normal shotgun.
[284.38s -> 290.62s]  So I would say before equipping the reserve shooter, try and get more confident with your regular shotgun.
[290.62s -> 298.49s]  And can you guys hear that? What are you doing? My dog is just literally digging in my bed, he's not going to go anywhere.
[298.49s -> 303.49s]  You are not going to go anywhere, I hope you know that, you're going to stay here, you can't dig through a bed, maybe you can.
[303.49s -> 305.49s]  I should be careful with that.
[305.49s -> 312.86s]  But anyways you get the idea, the reserve shooter is a little more advanced, a little more difficult to use.
[312.86s -> 320.86s]  So again I would suggest not using it until you're more familiar with the shotgun, you play with the shotgun for a while, then switch to the reserve shooter.
[320.86s -> 325.86s]  And I'll tell you right now, it took me a while to get these couple of little gameplay clips here.
[325.86s -> 331.86s]  I'm not that good with it, I've been trying to get better with it, trying to figure out a couple of different options to use it.
[331.86s -> 336.86s]  But hopefully some of this stuff can give you guys some tips and hopefully improve your reserve shooter game.
[336.86s -> 339.86s]  But that's going to be the end of the video, hopefully you guys enjoyed it.
[339.86s -> 342.86s]  Thank you so much for watching guys, I really do appreciate it.
[342.86s -> 348.03s]  And I will see you all next time, so take care everybody.
