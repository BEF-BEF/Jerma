[0.31s -> 20.09s]  Oh, don't worry, we can do it. What does that look like?
[23.42s -> 26.97s]  Oh, do you need some help? Don't worry, I'll help you.
[26.97s -> 35.35s]  Hey, what is going on guys? Welcome to my first ever quest tutorial video.
[35.35s -> 39.27s]  And what's going to happen here is we're going to teach you how to do a quest.
[39.27s -> 43.03s]  The most important thing in this is you want to get the quest, which is really easy.
[43.03s -> 48.23s]  There's a quest giver around the world. So after you get the quest, you do the quest,
[48.23s -> 51.75s]  and then you complete the quest. And that's really all there is to it.
[51.75s -> 52.15s]  Quest.
[52.15s -> 54.95s]  The thing in this game is really, really fun and interesting.
[54.95s -> 58.07s]  Quest, quest, quest, quest, get the quest.
[58.07s -> 68.25s]  What a beautiful land this is, wouldn't you say?
[71.10s -> 73.18s]  The sights, the sounds, the smells.
[78.06s -> 83.18s]  Oldham is full of treasures, my friend.
[83.18s -> 87.80s]  Treasure. I like that.
[87.80s -> 92.60s]  Yeah, some are easy for even simple men to discern, while others require wisdom to see.
[94.98s -> 101.14s]  Ah, what the hell am I doing? I can see that, oh, why am I doing this?
[104.20s -> 108.76s]  I knew that for that last one, you were literally just going to do what you did and just shout.
[108.76s -> 112.36s]  Well, no, because on my screen, I'm sitting next to this guy,
[112.36s -> 115.16s]  and he's telling me his life story, and I just don't care.
[116.74s -> 120.04s]  Well, not that I don't care, my character doesn't care.
[120.04s -> 122.52s]  At least he would. He's sitting here like stone.
[124.54s -> 128.14s]  Dude, when you see this video, look at my guy's hands.
[128.14s -> 130.86s]  He is like, he's sitting there like he's holding on.
[130.86s -> 132.06s]  Dude, it looks ridiculous.
[136.23s -> 137.51s]  My guy's hands.
[139.16s -> 142.12s]  Oh, he's like, it looks like he's got broken arms and he's in casts.
[143.67s -> 145.13s]  What?
[145.13s -> 146.65s]  This is a bumpy ride, by the way.
[146.65s -> 148.41s]  Who's manning this son of a bitch?
[148.41s -> 150.10s]  Okay, so they're weakened.
[150.82s -> 151.75s]  They're weak.
[154.42s -> 155.30s]  Oh, man.
[156.81s -> 158.89s]  And it only took like an hour and 10 minutes.
[160.01s -> 162.25s]  All right, you better queue up.
[162.25s -> 163.45s]  Hit that button.
[164.47s -> 166.07s]  Oh, you son of a bitch.
[167.78s -> 170.02s]  This guy better queue up or I'm going to be pissed.
[172.47s -> 173.67s]  It's probably the same guy.
[174.54s -> 175.66s]  Oh, thank God.
[175.66s -> 177.18s]  I was about to freak out.
[177.18s -> 180.12s]  Hey, look at that.
[180.12s -> 183.59s]  Where the hell are we?
[183.59s -> 187.91s]  Grim Batol.
[187.91s -> 192.09s]  Oh, our healer lagged out.
[192.09s -> 193.29s]  Oh, joy.
[197.70s -> 199.54s]  Look at this face of disappointment.
[201.53s -> 203.93s]  He is disappointed right now.
[203.93s -> 207.53s]  When the hell did I make my guy look this ugly?
[207.53s -> 210.33s]  He looks like Santa Claus Hulk Hogan right now.
[210.33s -> 211.53s]  When the hell did I do this?
[212.01s -> 213.59s]  Hello.
[215.29s -> 218.01s]  Hey, sorry I can't get in.
[218.01s -> 218.41s]  How?
[219.29s -> 223.35s]  He says I need to do the stupid quest before I'm allowed in.
[224.87s -> 225.19s]  What?
[226.23s -> 227.10s]  You can run?
[230.20s -> 230.60s]  Really?
[231.83s -> 232.07s]  Yeah.
[233.03s -> 233.51s]  Jesus.
[234.23s -> 234.55s]  Okay.
[235.19s -> 238.42s]  But you could get in this one without the quest.
[239.06s -> 239.30s]  Yeah.
[245.67s -> 246.63s]  Oh, and here we go.
[247.59s -> 248.79s]  This is the journey.
[248.79s -> 250.63s]  This is what it all comes down to.
[250.63s -> 252.39s]  That guy is huge, man.
[252.39s -> 255.43s]  Can I just...
[257.02s -> 258.46s]  I'm going to start attacking this guy.
[261.42s -> 262.54s]  Oh, that guy died.
[264.57s -> 266.33s]  I killed one of those marines.
[268.10s -> 269.46s]  I have to fight this guy?
[269.46s -> 271.54s]  How the hell am I going to fight this guy by myself?
[274.10s -> 275.54s]  I think those marines helped me.
[275.54s -> 276.81s]  Let's hope so.
[277.37s -> 278.33s]  Come on, you.
[278.33s -> 279.02s]  Don't worry.
[279.02s -> 279.74s]  I got my dogs.
[279.74s -> 281.50s]  Whoa, lasers everywhere.
[282.60s -> 283.00s]  Get him.
[283.64s -> 284.04s]  Get him.
[285.48s -> 286.44s]  Kill this son of a bitch.
[286.44s -> 286.76s]  Kill him.
[288.36s -> 289.08s]  Everything you got.
[289.08s -> 289.72s]  Heroism.
[290.44s -> 291.64s]  Super bomb move.
[292.20s -> 296.02s]  Oh, man.
[296.02s -> 296.42s]  Oh, man.
[299.38s -> 300.98s]  Intense battle sequence.
[300.98s -> 301.94s]  Get behind the colossus.
[307.03s -> 307.27s]  All right.
[307.27s -> 308.47s]  He did like a super smash.
[309.37s -> 310.41s]  This guy is toast.
[311.13s -> 311.69s]  Are you kidding me?
[314.44s -> 316.92s]  This guy is toast.
[316.92s -> 318.36s]  He is really, really cool looking, though.
[318.36s -> 319.88s]  I will say this is one of the coolest things
[319.88s -> 321.16s]  I've seen so far in the zone.
[322.04s -> 322.36s]  Ow.
[324.10s -> 324.42s]  Bitch.
[327.50s -> 328.78s]  Oh, and that's it.
[328.78s -> 329.18s]  See you.
[330.49s -> 331.61s]  See you later, dude.
[332.33s -> 333.94s]  Why is he not dying?
[335.22s -> 335.70s]  Oh.
[335.70s -> 340.02s]  He needs like two more DPS done.
[340.02s -> 340.58s]  I did it.
[342.54s -> 344.41s]  Wait, these guys are attacking me now.
[344.41s -> 345.77s]  Oh, no, they're not.
[345.77s -> 347.90s]  I'm wrong.
[347.90s -> 350.14s]  No, I can't use any of it.
[350.14s -> 352.12s]  I'm just going to take away.
[352.12s -> 353.48s]  What's the most expensive thing?
[353.48s -> 355.10s]  This.
[355.10s -> 355.34s]  Why?
[355.34s -> 357.43s]  Not very much.
[357.43s -> 360.07s]  Oh, oh, I did it.
[361.69s -> 362.89s]  I did all the quests.
[364.55s -> 367.40s]  I am the quest master.
[367.40s -> 369.48s]  I am the master of the quests.
[369.48s -> 373.30s]  And you cannot defeat me.
