[9.21s -> 12.81s]  Hey everybody, what's going on? It's Jerma again with a gameplay commentary.
[12.81s -> 18.09s]  More like multiple gameplay commentaries, because this is a new series I'm doing called Arena Madness,
[18.09s -> 22.97s]  which is where I play three or four classes in a row on two or three different maps on Arena.
[22.97s -> 27.21s]  Arena only, so if you don't like Arena, if you're not an Arena fan, I'm sorry,
[27.21s -> 31.62s]  but this is about 15 or 16 minutes long, so grab the popcorn for this one, guys.
[31.62s -> 36.82s]  Playing as the Demoman on Arena Badlands for the first of these four gameplays, I believe it is.
[36.82s -> 40.58s]  Get that scout with a nice shot from the splendid screen and the Persian Persuader,
[40.58s -> 44.26s]  so that's half the loadout of the match. The other half is the grenade launcher,
[44.26s -> 47.06s]  as you'll see here, kill that sniper with a nice couple of shots.
[47.06s -> 51.38s]  And this is great, this setup is unbelievable if you're going to play on an Arena match,
[51.38s -> 56.10s]  especially because you can get healed like that from anything on the ground.
[56.10s -> 59.94s]  It doesn't matter if it's a health pack, ammo, if it's somebody's gun,
[59.94s -> 63.22s]  that's the best part about doing this, because as you know, Arena matches,
[63.22s -> 68.26s]  your health is so important. Barrel into that scout, and I'm trying to get him to run over
[68.26s -> 72.74s]  one of the grenades, but he doesn't end up doing it. Instead, he just starts to taunt,
[72.74s -> 76.18s]  and I don't know if he was a bot or not, I don't think he was, but regardless,
[76.18s -> 81.70s]  it's a nice direct shot anyways. Top bee-hiving like a bee's nest, as you can see there.
[81.70s -> 85.22s]  We're going to move on to the next one now, this is still a Demoman. The next two,
[85.22s -> 89.46s]  I believe, are going to be Demoman gameplays. After that, it's a Pyro, and then after that,
[89.46s -> 93.94s]  I believe it's Sniper, and then Engineer. So you've got plenty of stuff to look forward to
[93.94s -> 99.61s]  if you're a fan of any of the classes. Stay tuned, alright, because there's a lot of stuff here.
[99.61s -> 104.97s]  Starting this one out, just absolutely spamming into this little corridor over there. I get a
[104.97s -> 109.77s]  random kill, and you heard the ding-a-lings, I got a ton of damage on so many other people that were
[109.77s -> 113.85s]  there, which is huge because there's no health packs to pick up, unless, of course, you're a
[113.85s -> 119.21s]  Demoman using this setup, or you're being healed by a medic or a dispenser, but that's the only
[119.21s -> 123.37s]  way to get health in an arena match. A lot of people don't know that, that health is not
[123.37s -> 128.39s]  available, and they go, where are the health packs when they come into a game? So I shoot my last
[128.39s -> 133.19s]  three shots over the cliff here, trying to get some random hit, and now we're just straight up
[133.19s -> 137.19s]  Demo Knight, and there's nothing I can do about it because with this setup, you cannot replenish
[137.19s -> 141.43s]  your ammo at all, but that's fine because arena matches don't really last that long anyways.
[141.43s -> 146.87s]  So I'd be a real Demo Spy, as you'll see. I'll try to explain this, look at this. See, I come around
[146.87s -> 151.19s]  the back and I'm being a real Demo Spy. I thought somebody saw me because somebody detonated a
[151.19s -> 155.83s]  sticky. I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a second, but watch this super lag mode. Oh,
[155.83s -> 159.99s]  I was so pissed about that, but it doesn't end up mattering at all because I end up smashing this
[159.99s -> 165.70s]  guy, picking up his health, which would be his ammo. Uber Heavy on the point. Now it's three to
[165.70s -> 171.30s]  three. This Heavy didn't even see me, so it's his demise. I take his head off with his head.
[172.17s -> 176.65s]  Final person is a Scout right here. I crush him with the shield, and then my teammates
[176.65s -> 181.45s]  get the final kill on the other Scout that was down there. So we are the winners. I didn't top
[181.45s -> 186.33s]  Gordy Smith like a gourd, so that's too bad, but anyways, let's move on to the next one. This is
[186.33s -> 191.77s]  the final Demoman gameplay of the series. This one starts off okay, but as you'll see, I really,
[191.77s -> 196.89s]  really blow the first blood buff. I was so pissed about it, you guys don't even know. I was freaking
[196.89s -> 201.05s]  out because it would have been so awesome. You'll see, I get under the bridge, smash this Pyro.
[201.05s -> 206.09s]  I have the buff now, and here we go. Oh, I don't do anything with it. I didn't even have grenades
[206.09s -> 211.62s]  loaded into the chamber. If I had turned up here with that first blood buff, I could have killed
[211.62s -> 216.63s]  five people with those grenades. It would have been insane. So now I'm just trying to help my
[216.63s -> 220.95s]  teammates right here. There's a Heavy medic pair going into their spawn area, just trying to get
[220.95s -> 225.51s]  a couple grenades in there. I get somebody with a random one, direct shot this guy, see the Spy,
[225.51s -> 230.63s]  and that's three kills in a row. And now I'm just trying to patrol the area to see if anyone else
[230.63s -> 234.71s]  is around. There's one person that's floating around somewhere. I don't know where he is. I'm
[234.71s -> 239.51s]  sure he's back by the spawn. So it doesn't end up mattering at all because I got the place guarded,
[239.51s -> 243.27s]  and the Heavy medic pair down there gets the kill, I believe. Or I think it's actually a scout. It
[243.27s -> 248.55s]  is a scout. We win the match, and I get five kills out of 10 people, which is pretty good if you ask
[248.55s -> 253.43s]  me, especially on Arena. So let's move on to the Pyro. The Pyro loadout for the first match is
[253.43s -> 258.79s]  going to be the degreaser, the shotgun, and the power jack. I didn't want to use the power jack,
[258.79s -> 264.47s]  but Steam was having all kinds of issues the last couple of days with item loadouts. So I
[264.47s -> 268.89s]  don't even equip it. I don't even take it out one time, so don't worry. It doesn't matter.
[268.89s -> 273.13s]  Coming around the back here, trying to be a good Pyro. See this scout? Light him on fire,
[273.13s -> 276.41s]  and he tries to run away, and I end up getting the kill on him. Not with the shotgun, but the
[276.41s -> 279.85s]  afterburn, which is kind of odd because we were both shooting at him with the shotgun.
[279.85s -> 283.85s]  This Heavy is not paying attention. He goes down. I thought I was screwed, but I do end up killing
[283.85s -> 287.74s]  him with the shotgun. Me and this soldier down here trying to be a little cautious because we
[287.74s -> 293.34s]  were down by about three people. Now it's tied, and now we are ahead. A Heavy just completely
[293.34s -> 297.34s]  dominated three or four people right there. There's a sniper here. He's not really paying
[297.34s -> 301.50s]  attention to his left, so I take him out just with the flamethrower. I think he's a spy,
[301.50s -> 305.34s]  but no, that's just my soldier buddy. Get an assist with the shotgun on that scout,
[305.34s -> 310.30s]  and now it's four to two, and when it just a second ago was nine to six in their favor.
[310.30s -> 313.66s]  Coming around the back here, this Heavy does not know that I'm going to do this for some reason.
[313.66s -> 318.14s]  I get him with a shotgun kill, and now it's four to one. We have this pretty much in the bag. We
[318.14s -> 322.62s]  came back from a pretty high deficit. I get killed by the needle gun, and he kills two people with
[322.62s -> 327.29s]  that needle gun. He came pretty close to the amount of health. Look at that health. He came
[327.29s -> 333.75s]  pretty damn close to taking that whole thing back, so good try for that medic. This next pyro gameplay
[333.75s -> 338.79s]  is going to replace the shotgun with the detonator, the new uber update item for the pyro. This is the
[338.79s -> 346.33s]  same thing as the flare gun except you can detonate him in midair like this, and watch what happens.
[346.33s -> 350.41s]  Detonate at the right time, and I got somebody. I have no idea how. I thought that was really
[350.41s -> 355.45s]  cool, though. Just a long-range blind detonation, and I got somebody. I get an assist for that,
[355.45s -> 360.46s]  too, by the way. Come down here just to try and do a couple more random detonations, and let me talk
[360.46s -> 365.18s]  about the detonator for just one second. I don't care that it has less crit damage. I know that's
[365.18s -> 369.82s]  a big problem for some people, and hold on just a second. I almost get myself killed here. I almost
[369.82s -> 373.82s]  just run into my own death. I got to blow this scout out, too, because he's on fire, and I'm
[373.82s -> 377.46s]  looking for him. I thought he ran behind me, but he's right there. I get him. Don't worry.
[377.46s -> 381.94s]  So it's 6 to 4 now. We have a pretty good advantage now. I come up here. There's a sniper
[381.94s -> 385.78s]  that I picked off. Nice shot. He doesn't think I'm going to go this way. He tries to go the
[385.78s -> 390.82s]  other direction. I get him with a crit. 40 damage is okay. That's fine for me, like I was saying
[390.82s -> 394.90s]  before. I get a nice shot. This is a good example right here of why the detonator is great. End the
[394.90s -> 399.22s]  game. I didn't even come close to hitting him, but I detonated it at the right time, and we win.
[400.10s -> 407.46s]  Time to move on to the sniper, and the map changes as well. We move on to granary. I'm a sniper. Like
[407.46s -> 415.38s]  I said before, using the sniper rifle, of course, the Shahanshah, and the Darwin shield, I believe.
[415.38s -> 420.42s]  Yep, the Darwin's danger shield. So I have been practicing with the sniper rifle. I wanted to get
[420.42s -> 427.22s]  good with it, and I found, as you'll see, bang, quickscoping is all I can do, and I do very,
[427.22s -> 433.38s]  very well with quickscoping. I can't sit there and camp and get a headshot. I over-aim. I under-aim.
[433.38s -> 438.66s]  I'm terrible when I hold the thing down and wait for it to get a charge, and you will see,
[438.66s -> 444.10s]  I don't think there is one time in either of these two sniper gameplays that I wait for it to get
[444.10s -> 449.91s]  even halfway of a charge. There's another quickscope headshot. I don't know. I have such
[449.91s -> 456.09s]  ADD and such like ADHD that I can't stand to have to sit there and wait, and some of these
[456.09s -> 460.65s]  headshots should have definitely registered, but they didn't. Like right there, I thought for sure
[460.65s -> 465.67s]  that I got that guy right in the side of the face, but I guess not. So five to three. This is
[465.67s -> 471.11s]  looking grim for our team. It actually has a pretty cool ending, even though it's a complete failure.
[471.11s -> 476.07s]  Five to two now. I'm trying to find a place where I can sneak in. Look, it's five to one.
[476.07s -> 480.39s]  I get a nice little body shot on that soldier. I'm trying to hide. They know I'm here. I'm trying
[480.39s -> 485.99s]  to jump around all over the place. Nice headshot. Quickscope on his face. Four to one now. I thought
[485.99s -> 490.25s]  I could get a headshot, or I thought I could pick them off from above like a bird of prey.
[490.33s -> 493.61s]  Don't get a headshot right there. And now I'm just like, you know what? Screw it. They're
[493.61s -> 498.49s]  going to get the point. I'm just going to go up there and kamikaze. And he ends up killing himself
[498.49s -> 503.37s]  on me. So I ended up killing like three people right there. So take it for what it is, I guess.
[503.37s -> 509.08s]  So this is the second sniper gameplay, and you'll see the same scout does the same path, but I miss
[509.08s -> 514.36s]  him this time. Or do I? That's what you'll see in the end. Result, bang, right in his face.
[514.36s -> 517.88s]  Coming around the corner, another scout I tried to pick off with a headshot. That would have been
[517.88s -> 522.76s]  sick if I got both of those scouts. Because we all know that scouts on arena maps are incredibly
[522.76s -> 528.20s]  powerful. They're like the main artery of arena maps. They're the ones that get all the stuff
[528.20s -> 532.28s]  done. They're the ones that are running around killing people, capping points. So getting rid
[532.28s -> 537.80s]  of scouts is incredibly important. Nice headshot there. It doesn't matter. He was overhealed,
[537.80s -> 541.40s]  and he was a heavy anyways. He wouldn't have died. I get an assist on him, though, which is
[541.40s -> 547.40s]  pretty cool. So this is one of the only times I charge to about full, and I miss. See? I'm awful
[547.40s -> 551.72s]  when I have to wait, even though I've missed like half of the quickscope shots anyways. But you get
[551.72s -> 556.66s]  the idea. Coming up this little area here, I want to make sure I can get a nice spot. I end up getting
[556.66s -> 561.22s]  a nice quick little headshot on this Demoman right here. Spank, but didn't kill him, but I get the
[561.22s -> 566.23s]  assist. I saw that there was a medic down there, and I figured that the heavy medic pair would be
[566.23s -> 570.71s]  right here, which they are. I come down here, get a quickscope headshot. Probably could have saved
[570.71s -> 575.03s]  the day, potentially, but there was an uber down there anyways. And then the final person is a
[575.03s -> 581.43s]  medic. Where is he? Nobody knows. There he is. Headshot to end the game. And now we are going
[581.43s -> 587.43s]  to move on to the engineer. This is the final one. It is the most devastating I kill. Well,
[587.43s -> 593.93s]  you'll see. I do very, very well. So playing as the combat engineer using the Mini-Sentry,
[593.93s -> 598.73s]  the Frontier Justice, and the pistol, starting it up trying to get this dispenser built because
[598.73s -> 603.69s]  this is the only way people can heal themselves without a medic. It's very, very important. If
[603.69s -> 610.09s]  you play engineer, make sure the first thing you do before doing anything is building a dispenser.
[610.09s -> 615.21s]  And as you can see, we had 10 people on the team, and we just got demolished right there. Nice
[615.21s -> 618.81s]  shotgun kill on that scout, and here comes another scout. I thought for sure I was going to be able
[618.81s -> 624.41s]  to kill this guy. Pull out the pistol, and nope, not enough. I get a lot of people with stray bullets,
[624.41s -> 628.57s]  though. I don't want to get too overzealous over there because I am only an engineer. And watch,
[628.57s -> 633.69s]  what is this other engineer even doing? He's just switching his weapons out over and over again.
[634.17s -> 638.25s]  I have no idea. It could be a bot. I don't know. Because arena matches, they're very,
[638.25s -> 642.65s]  very synonymous with not having people play in them. So at least two or three people on each
[642.65s -> 646.81s]  team will probably be a bot, at least in my opinion. Get a nice shot with that shotgun,
[646.81s -> 651.77s]  get another shotgun kill, and my Mini-Sentry killed somebody before that. So that's pure
[651.77s -> 656.81s]  awesomeness right there. This sentry gets placed in a very sneaky spot, and it kills two people
[656.81s -> 662.89s]  right off the bat. And you'll see the numbers. Check it out, what happens. Three to two, two to
[662.97s -> 667.85s]  one now is what it ends up being after that last sentry kill. It's me versus these last two people.
[667.85s -> 672.81s]  So let's see what happens. I have some crits. I'm ready to rock and roll. Place the sentry down.
[672.81s -> 678.25s]  Do I get the kill? Yes, I do. And what happens one on one? Who is going to win this battle?
[678.25s -> 685.37s]  It's going to be me with my Mini-Sentry. Seven kills and one assist. I ended up killing like
[685.37s -> 690.41s]  almost the entire team right there. So that was pretty awesome. And thank you guys all for
[690.41s -> 695.11s]  watching. Again, I appreciate it. I'll see you all next time. Take care, everybody.
