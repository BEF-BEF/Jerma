[0.31s -> 19.57s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerba here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and today I'm going to be playing as the Soldier, and I don't know what the loadout is, forgive me.
[19.57s -> 27.57s]  I'm probably just going to show it on the screen right now for you to check it out, but this video is not going to be about much of the gameplay.
[27.57s -> 32.57s]  I'm going to talk about a very, very, very specific topic, and it does have to do with Team Fortress 2.
[32.57s -> 38.57s]  There are some things you could say about this topic that will fall into Team Fortress, and we'll talk about them.
[38.57s -> 46.57s]  So first of all, the title of the video is probably like, what is game balance or how difficult is game balance, and I will explain this title.
[46.57s -> 53.94s]  And pretty much what I mean by this is, how hard is it really to balance a video game?
[53.94s -> 60.94s]  And this is going to be one of those discussion videos where I open it up to the comments, I want to hear what you guys have to say, get something going, get some type of fight going.
[60.94s -> 62.94s]  Actually, don't start a fight, please don't do that.
[62.94s -> 65.94s]  You know, can we just talk about this for a second?
[65.94s -> 72.24s]  I hate when fights break out in my comment section, because I always feel like I can't pick a side.
[72.24s -> 82.24s]  You can never pick a side in these heated fights that happen in comment sections, because you'll piss off half the people that potentially agreed or disagreed with that particular person.
[82.24s -> 87.24s]  So I always like to play a referee when stuff like that happens, but I never remove comments.
[87.24s -> 98.24s]  One of the big things about this channel and about how I feel as a person is if somebody has an opinion, whether it be good or bad, if somebody hates my guts and wants to say Jerma, you're ugly.
[98.24s -> 108.54s]  I'm not going to remove that comment only because at that point you start to censor what you deem as worthy for your comment section, and it starts to get a hold of you.
[108.54s -> 113.54s]  You start to remove more comments, you don't like what that guy says, you don't, shut up, I don't like what you said.
[113.54s -> 119.78s]  I like to keep my comment section completely open, except for blatantly offensive things.
[119.78s -> 124.78s]  Like if somebody just starts slinging around incredibly offensive language, then I will probably remove it.
[124.78s -> 130.09s]  But regardless of that, we're going to move on, we're going to start talking about the actual topic of this video.
[130.09s -> 136.39s]  So first of all, the reason why I'm making this video is because I was hanging out in a Skype call, like I typically do with friends.
[136.39s -> 141.39s]  I do it pretty much every day, and we were talking specifically about one particular game.
[141.39s -> 147.39s]  I'm not going to throw the game under the bus, I'm not going to say, oh, it's Doom 3, it's not Doom 3.
[147.39s -> 153.95s]  But we were talking about a game, and we were saying, man, this is not how I would do this.
[153.95s -> 158.95s]  This game has a lot of broken stuff in it, as fun and as good as it is.
[158.95s -> 160.95s]  There's some things that are really wrong with this game.
[160.95s -> 170.95s]  And unfortunately, here's the real predicament when you start talking that type of language with people, is we don't know as gamers what happens behind the scenes.
[170.95s -> 177.95s]  None of us have any type of crystal ball that can show us what happens in these development studios on a typical workday.
[177.95s -> 179.95s]  We just don't know that.
[179.95s -> 183.95s]  But what we do know is passion, and a lot of us are core gamers.
[183.95s -> 189.95s]  I consider myself a pretty core gamer, and we get very invested in the games that we are currently playing,
[189.95s -> 198.95s]  enough so that we start to see problems that developers might not even see because they are just working on these games
[198.95s -> 201.95s]  and sort of going through the motions when they go to work.
[201.95s -> 209.38s]  Now, I am not saying that all these development studios that could have potentially unbalanced or imbalanced things in their game,
[209.38s -> 214.38s]  they don't just go to work and like, I'm done, let's go get shit-faced.
[214.38s -> 221.38s]  No, obviously, if you work in the gaming industry and you work in the art field, you work in the balance field, you are passionate.
[221.38s -> 227.38s]  You don't go into gaming, you don't go to work for a gaming company not caring about the games that you make.
[227.38s -> 232.38s]  But I really do feel like there is a disconnect between development companies and communities.
[232.38s -> 237.38s]  And I've talked about communities in a video before where the more invested in the community
[237.38s -> 244.38s]  and what the community has to say that a game company is, the game will turn out 10,000 times better,
[244.38s -> 247.38s]  and people are more willing to throw money at it.
[247.38s -> 251.38s]  That's why Team Fortress 2 has done so well and why people support it so much.
[252.38s -> 258.38s]  Sure, I could probably name you like a couple things in Team Fortress 2 that I think are just dumb.
[258.38s -> 263.38s]  But really though, if you look at the big picture and how much support that Valve has shown the community
[263.38s -> 266.38s]  and how much they've actually listened over the years,
[266.38s -> 275.38s]  and Valve's motto, Valve's motto over the last at least few three or four or five years has been games as a service, in quotes.
[275.38s -> 280.38s]  And what that means is instead of just releasing a video game and saying,
[280.38s -> 283.38s]  it's done, it sucks, you know what?
[283.38s -> 287.38s]  Screw it. If you don't like it, then we'll try better next time.
[287.38s -> 294.38s]  We already got you $60. I don't care. I'm the CEO of this big company and I have like two jets.
[294.38s -> 296.38s]  That's the disconnect I'm talking about.
[296.38s -> 303.06s]  But how hard is it, how difficult is in reality is it to balance a video game?
[303.06s -> 306.06s]  Because when we were talking in the Skype call that I mentioned,
[306.06s -> 311.06s]  we were mentioning things that seemed like they were very basic mathematical changes
[311.06s -> 314.06s]  that you could do to completely fix the game.
[314.06s -> 319.23s]  And it really got me thinking. It's like there has to be a reason why some of these things do not get changed.
[319.23s -> 323.23s]  There has to be a reason behind it, even with community outcry,
[323.23s -> 328.23s]  even with people saying, man, there's something really wrong with that, dude.
[328.23s -> 330.23s]  Are you going to do anything about that?
[330.23s -> 334.23s]  And it happens across the board in a lot of different games.
[334.23s -> 339.23s]  And who is ultimately responsible for the final decision of a game change?
[339.23s -> 343.23s]  Is it a one dude? Is it a team of people that come together and they say,
[343.23s -> 345.23s]  okay, we're going to do this, we're going to change X, Y, and Z.
[345.23s -> 350.23s]  And then they hand that off to some guy and he can like veto it if he really wants to.
[350.23s -> 354.23s]  Anybody in the comments that has any type of game development experience
[354.23s -> 359.23s]  or if you know something about this or if you actually have real world experience with this,
[359.23s -> 363.23s]  please let me know because that's a question I've been asking myself for a very long time.
[363.23s -> 370.23s]  All the way back to my like Diablo days when I would see something that just really in my mind didn't make sense.
[370.23s -> 374.41s]  Why don't things get changed when they very evidently should?
[374.41s -> 377.41s]  And I guess I'm going to end the video there. That's going to wrap it up here, guys.
[377.41s -> 381.41s]  Keep the discussion going in the comments. I'll be chiming in a little bit as well.
[381.41s -> 384.41s]  And thank you so much for watching. I'll see you guys all next time.
[384.41s -> 386.41s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
