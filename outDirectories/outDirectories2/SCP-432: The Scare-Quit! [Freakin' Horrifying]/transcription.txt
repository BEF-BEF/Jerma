[28.82s -> 36.51s]  15 minutes just sitting here going I do I want to do this and the answer is yes
[36.75s -> 42.15s]  Let's go. So this is kind of like the other SCP games
[42.19s -> 49.55s]  It is very very dark kind of like the other SCP games where you would go investigate
[49.99s -> 53.43s]  things and stuff
[53.83s -> 57.71s]  That's a light. Okay
[57.71s -> 60.15s]  Apparently I got to pick up artifacts or something
[60.35s -> 70.14s]  the worst part is just the fact that it's just the same texture over and over again in this maze of a building and
[76.73s -> 79.29s]  There's a monster in here
[79.61s -> 85.18s]  Somewhere is a valve. Don't think I need to do anything with that. Okay, what's this?
[85.34s -> 91.78s]  You found an artifact the artifact. Okay. So what do I do with it?
[91.78s -> 101.54s]  I think I just have to pick them up and then escape just got to escape
[101.80s -> 109.85s]  Just got to pick up the artifacts and just get the hell out of here crying out loud. It's a goddamn maze
[110.49s -> 117.55s]  These pipes keep scaring the shit out of me. What was that?
[117.55s -> 128.33s]  I kind of don't want to go over to this light, but I kind of feel like I have to all right F is flashlight
[128.33s -> 138.48s]  All right, that's just the light bulb. Okay. Why am I shaking? Why is why is the world shaking?
[143.33s -> 150.08s]  Can hear noises that I don't like to hear. Yeah
[150.60s -> 162.26s]  What's that? What's this like fairy dust on the ground? Oh, this is roller skates sick
[162.26s -> 166.38s]  I got like the roller skates I can compete in like the roller derby
[166.38s -> 182.75s]  I got two not exactly sure what that means, but there's nothing over here. I wish there was like a map
[186.28s -> 197.13s]  Turn it turn the flashlight off turn the flash light off hold
[201.41s -> 212.30s]  What is that on the wall it's gone what is what is that it's not there anymore

[223.40s -> 232.57s]  I just did all my reps for like the week cuz like the thing with like the the flaming
[233.10s -> 243.84s]  Dr. Doom skull was looking at me. There's just no I just don't know where I'm going
[244.24s -> 260.03s]  There's just no indication of where you're ever supposed to go in these games. Good evening. My name is Jerma

[269.63s -> 280.43s]  Oh

[310.85s -> 319.63s]  Okay, the tight corridors make it so much worse, but a quick little scare Saturdays guys
[319.91s -> 326.09s]  I'm a baby. I know but that thing was too scary and I almost died
