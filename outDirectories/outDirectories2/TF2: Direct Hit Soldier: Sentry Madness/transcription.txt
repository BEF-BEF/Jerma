[1.14s -> 6.34s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[6.34s -> 11.74s]  Friday before Christmas. Christmas Eve is tomorrow. I can't wait. I love Christmas time, guys.
[11.74s -> 19.54s]  And you guys should all be excited as well because the giveaway is tomorrow at 9 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.
[19.54s -> 23.92s]  Good luck to everybody, and if you have no idea what I'm talking about,
[23.92s -> 29.72s]  there's gonna be a link in the description. Go enter that contest. You have until tomorrow morning to do it.
[29.92s -> 35.12s]  And because we are talking about Christmas and Christmas Eve, on Sunday, Christmas Day,
[35.12s -> 41.02s]  there will be a Grandpa episode. A very special Christmas Grandpa episode.
[41.02s -> 48.60s]  So stay tuned to Machinima Respawn for that. Sunday at 4 p.m. Pacific Time. Check your local listings.
[48.60s -> 54.07s]  So what are we doing right now? This is a direct hit soldier on Hoodoo, Payload Hoodoo.
[54.07s -> 58.87s]  I've gotten a couple of requests from the same person over and over again to do this.
[58.87s -> 64.17s]  So hey, I'm finally gonna do it for you. The guy that's been asking for like two months.
[64.17s -> 67.85s]  I'm gonna give you your direct hit gameplay. Here it is.
[67.85s -> 76.08s]  Sorry it took so long. So the loadout is gonna be the direct hit, the shotgun, the strain shotgun, and the equalizer.
[76.08s -> 81.28s]  I do a lot of work, and the title of this video is something that's gonna be like Century Madness
[81.28s -> 86.48s]  because they have like five or six engineers with a ton of century guns,
[86.48s -> 90.48s]  and I take out so many centuries with this thing, it's insane.
[90.48s -> 96.38s]  And that brings up a great point. This rocket launcher, thanks for the Uber by the way,
[96.38s -> 102.58s]  this rocket launcher can take out a level three century in two rockets. That's it.
[102.58s -> 105.98s]  You don't have to shoot it five times, you just have to land two rockets,
[105.98s -> 111.75s]  and it takes about one and a half seconds to drop a level three century.
[111.75s -> 117.05s]  This is obviously if the engineer is not right there repairing it like this one is right now,
[117.05s -> 123.45s]  but regardless, it can be a lot to have to handle if you are not standing right next to your century gun.
[123.45s -> 128.75s]  You will lose it in one second. You have to use the element of surprise, I guess,
[128.75s -> 131.45s]  when using the direct hit going after a century.
[131.45s -> 137.35s]  It is especially important in not a situation like this where there are a million people, a million century guns,
[137.35s -> 141.85s]  but in a typical situation, the other team will have maybe one or two engineers,
[141.85s -> 145.85s]  and they'll be going back and forth, grabbing stuff, turning around, whacking the century.
[145.85s -> 150.15s]  So if you time it right, if you can sit there and observe an engineer doing something,
[150.15s -> 153.89s]  you can take out the century within a split second of him turning around.
[153.89s -> 159.39s]  Get Ubercharged here, take out the century in two shots, and the engineer, go after the dispenser as well,
[159.39s -> 163.19s]  and if you were paying attention, I killed this is number five right here.
[163.19s -> 167.19s]  That's five centuries that have gone down in the last 30 seconds.
[167.19s -> 170.37s]  So if you can see what I'm talking about, it's pretty ridiculous.
[170.37s -> 173.67s]  Somebody else killed the fifth one. I think I had four right there,
[173.67s -> 176.17s]  because there was one over on the left side that somebody took out.
[176.17s -> 179.87s]  But regardless, I die right here, yoink, crit rocket in my face.
[179.87s -> 183.51s]  Let's skip the respawn time, because nobody wants to watch that.
[183.51s -> 187.91s]  So if you are looking for direct hit tips, I can't really give them to you.
[187.91s -> 192.28s]  I can maybe give you one, but the reason for that is because I don't really use it that often.
[192.28s -> 197.02s]  I use this and the cow mangler pretty much the same amount of time.
[197.02s -> 199.22s]  They're my bottom two rocket launchers.
[199.22s -> 202.02s]  So I can't really give you a whole lot of crazy things.
[202.02s -> 206.32s]  That being said, I can tell you one of the biggest tips I can give you,
[206.32s -> 212.40s]  make sure you always have at least two rockets in this clip before you go after somebody.
[212.40s -> 214.40s]  You will miss a lot with this thing.
[214.40s -> 217.50s]  And as you'll see here, I actually get ubercharged in a second,
[217.50s -> 221.34s]  and I miss this heavy like seven times in a row.
[221.34s -> 226.14s]  And the reason why it happens is because I keep reloading once, shooting it, reloading once, shooting it.
[226.14s -> 227.94s]  That doesn't work with the direct hit.
[227.94s -> 230.94s]  You have to really be precise. You have to know when to shoot.
[230.94s -> 235.21s]  You can't just blow around like a regular rocket launcher. It doesn't work that way.
[235.21s -> 238.58s]  Another tip I can give you is aim low.
[238.58s -> 243.58s]  I found this to be very, very true because if you aim too high with this rocket launcher,
[243.58s -> 248.88s]  you are going to go right by everybody's heads and you're not going to hit anybody behind anyone.
[248.88s -> 254.12s]  You want to try and go right for the gut, right for the breadbasket, right in the middle of the stomach.
[254.12s -> 258.70s]  Don't shoot too low. Don't go for their feet or their shins because it might just blow up in front of them.
[258.70s -> 264.20s]  But the reason why you do it is you're going to prevent yourself from shooting rockets into the skybox.
[264.20s -> 267.20s]  I can't tell you how many times I've shot this rocket launcher,
[267.20s -> 272.33s]  and it goes whizzing by everybody into a wall or into the sky.
[272.33s -> 274.73s]  Another tip, this is the last one I can give you right there.
[274.73s -> 278.33s]  If somebody gets too close, have your shotgun ready to go
[278.33s -> 283.41s]  because it's actually pretty difficult to land a direct hit shot somebody right in front of you.
[283.41s -> 286.51s]  I don't know, maybe that's just me, but it's actually difficult for me to do that.
[286.51s -> 291.81s]  So I just whip my shotgun out if they get too close, put a couple of shots in their face and they are dealt with.
[291.81s -> 296.91s]  Now this part right here is the most ridiculous part of the entire gameplay.
[296.91s -> 300.41s]  I get ubercharged right here. I promise you, none of these people are bots.
[300.41s -> 301.88s]  None of them are bots.
[301.88s -> 304.98s]  If there were any bots, there were probably only one or two.
[304.98s -> 308.08s]  Nothing like the whole team. I don't know. I have no idea.
[308.08s -> 309.38s]  You'll see what happens.
[309.38s -> 310.88s]  Come around this left side here.
[310.88s -> 312.68s]  Engineer tries to build another sentry.
[312.68s -> 314.78s]  I take it out and I take out the dispenser.
[314.78s -> 316.18s]  Oh my God, a sniper!
[316.18s -> 317.98s]  Don't worry, got my shotgun.
[317.98s -> 320.58s]  Take him out, take out the dispenser and then watch.
[320.58s -> 323.18s]  I feel like I was a disguised spy.
[323.18s -> 324.78s]  I really felt like I had a disguise on.
[324.78s -> 326.38s]  I was like, what the hell is going on?
[326.38s -> 329.96s]  I'm literally behind the whole team and no one is acknowledging me.
[329.96s -> 334.16s]  Even if these people were bots, they would have turned around and acknowledged me when I shot them.
[334.16s -> 336.36s]  This is like, what is going on?
[336.36s -> 339.96s]  Eventually, they start to acknowledge I'm here because I think they see the cart is moving.
[339.96s -> 345.44s]  But look, even still, I'm still just sitting on the cart just going, okay, I'll just pick off random people.
[345.44s -> 346.34s]  And I kill a bunch of people.
[346.34s -> 350.24s]  I get this guy, get that guy, take out one more person, then I get killed.
[350.24s -> 353.91s]  And if you take a look at the timer, there's only 30 seconds left.
[353.91s -> 357.91s]  Here's my feeble attempt to get on the cart within five seconds.
[357.91s -> 361.61s]  Does not work out and we lose the game, unfortunately.
[361.61s -> 363.21s]  But that's gonna be it, guys.
[363.21s -> 366.51s]  Have a very, very Merry Christmas if you happen to celebrate it.
[366.51s -> 368.41s]  Have a fantastic weekend, everybody.
[368.41s -> 370.21s]  I will see you all next time.
[370.21s -> 372.31s]  Take care, everybody.
[372.31s -> 373.71s]  And good luck on the contest!
