[0.00s -> 21.70s]  What's up, Doc? What's up, Doc?
[21.70s -> 25.70s]  I don't think a motorcycle can go through these tiny holes.
[25.70s -> 28.83s]  It's duck season.
[28.83s -> 34.39s]  Hey, Jeremiah, I think we're playing a zombie game and I need you to cooperate.
[34.39s -> 38.82s]  I have so much of this in my mouth. I have to spit this out.
[38.82s -> 44.05s]  What's up, Doc?
[44.05s -> 52.24s]  Dude, come on. I'm going to break your arms with this brick.
[52.24s -> 54.24s]  Shit, E. Press E.
[54.24s -> 56.24s]  Come on.
[56.24s -> 63.04s]  One hand plays the game, the other hand pretends to be Bugs Bunny.
[63.04s -> 67.01s]  Get in this taxi.
[67.01s -> 69.50s]  Yeah, scoop me up in the taxi.
[69.50s -> 71.50s]  That sounds like a good scooper.
[71.50s -> 78.11s]  No, put the thing down. Put it down. Put the thing down. Put the thing down.
[78.11s -> 80.48s]  What the fuck?
[80.48s -> 82.91s]  I'm not going to make it, man.
[82.91s -> 84.91s]  Holy shit.
[84.91s -> 88.11s]  Okay, dude, seriously.
[88.11s -> 90.11s]  What's happening?
[90.11s -> 94.11s]  Let me get a car. Stop. Stop driving.
[94.11s -> 96.11s]  I'm trying to get out of here. We have to go.
[96.11s -> 100.40s]  I know, but I want...
[100.40s -> 102.40s]  There we go. Okay, don't do anything.
[102.40s -> 107.07s]  All right, now drive.
[107.07s -> 109.07s]  Okay, now lift me up. Oh, this is going to work.
[109.07s -> 113.85s]  Is it going to work? Who is this working for?
[113.85s -> 123.46s]  I think we are lagging bad because stuff is happening on my screen that's not...
[123.46s -> 125.46s]  Which actually is probably a pretty good thing.
[125.46s -> 129.77s]  So we should probably go do something stupid.
[129.77s -> 132.77s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[132.77s -> 135.77s]  I am done. We are playing the game.
[135.77s -> 137.77s]  Let's go.
[137.77s -> 140.77s]  We are playing the video game Dead Rising 3.
[140.77s -> 142.94s]  There, I helped you get out.
[142.94s -> 144.94s]  Can my girlfriend come with us?
[144.94s -> 150.32s]  Absolutely, let's go.
[150.32s -> 152.32s]  Everybody loves Terra.
[152.32s -> 154.32s]  Oh my god, you...
[154.32s -> 156.32s]  Oh, made it.
[156.32s -> 158.32s]  Holy shit, that was a jump. I didn't even realize that.
[158.32s -> 160.32s]  Don't go back. I jumped out.
[160.32s -> 162.32s]  No, no, no, no, you idiot. Did you fall?
[162.32s -> 166.35s]  What are you doing? Get in.
[166.35s -> 168.35s]  I don't want to fall back.
[168.35s -> 170.35s]  I'm not going to fall back.
[170.35s -> 172.35s]  You seriously think I'm going to fall back?
[172.35s -> 177.09s]  What a fucking dummy.
[177.09s -> 179.09s]  I'm not doing this. Get in.
[179.09s -> 181.09s]  I'm not doing this joke.
[181.09s -> 183.09s]  Well, then you die. I surrender.
[183.09s -> 185.71s]  All right, get in for real.
[185.71s -> 188.59s]  Get in for real this time.
[188.59s -> 190.59s]  Get in for real.
[190.59s -> 193.59s]  I'm going to spin around. I'm going to do a three point turn.
[193.59s -> 196.59s]  I'm only doing this to get fucking, you know, able to...
[197.59s -> 203.08s]  What?
[203.08s -> 205.08s]  Physics. Physics, how is this possible?
[205.08s -> 208.08s]  Oh, there's a fucking thing in the middle right here.
[208.08s -> 211.92s]  Okay, it all worked out.
[211.92s -> 213.92s]  Look, it all worked out.
[213.92s -> 215.92s]  Now, climb back up.
[215.92s -> 217.92s]  Get in the car.
[217.92s -> 223.04s]  All right, I'll figure this all out.
[223.04s -> 225.04s]  Get out.
[225.04s -> 227.04s]  I'm begging you to come play the game with me.
[227.04s -> 229.04s]  I know, but this has to happen.
[229.04s -> 232.11s]  Push it off.
[232.11s -> 235.95s]  I want to see the big explosion.
[235.95s -> 237.95s]  No, it needs to fall off.
[237.95s -> 243.52s]  Don't just like throw shit at it.
[243.52s -> 245.95s]  Fuck.
[245.95s -> 249.41s]  What happened? Did you fall off?
[249.41s -> 251.41s]  No.
[251.41s -> 254.03s]  Hold on a second. I'm crashing.
[254.03s -> 256.27s]  I crashed. That's what happened.
[256.27s -> 258.90s]  I crashed.
[258.90s -> 260.90s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[260.90s -> 262.90s]  I am done.
[262.90s -> 264.90s]  We are playing the game.
[264.90s -> 266.90s]  Let's go.
[266.90s -> 268.90s]  Come on. Fill me with bullets.
[268.90s -> 270.90s]  Come on. That's all you got.
[270.90s -> 272.90s]  I can take another 200.
[272.90s -> 274.90s]  Another 2000.
[277.89s -> 279.89s]  No.
[279.89s -> 281.89s]  I've been thwarted.
[281.89s -> 286.42s]  I don't know what to do here, man.
[286.42s -> 288.42s]  There's a car blocking this way.
[288.42s -> 290.42s]  Do you see this car blocking the exit?
[290.42s -> 293.17s]  I see the car blocking the exit.
[293.17s -> 296.50s]  How am I supposed to get out of here?
[296.50s -> 298.50s]  There's a window.
[298.50s -> 302.08s]  Did you know there was a window?
[302.08s -> 306.50s]  Yeah.
[306.50s -> 308.50s]  She's calling in her reinforcements.
[308.50s -> 310.50s]  Why did I just spawn next to her?
[310.50s -> 312.67s]  Yeah, you are right next to her.
[312.67s -> 314.98s]  Are you alive?
[314.98s -> 316.98s]  Yeah, the cutscene ended and I just appeared on her.
[316.98s -> 318.98s]  I have no guns now.
[318.98s -> 320.98s]  I'll kill her with flares.
[320.98s -> 324.24s]  See, you don't know where she is.
[324.24s -> 326.48s]  She's right there.
[326.48s -> 328.72s]  There's a grenade under your feet.
[328.72s -> 335.55s]  You probably should move.
[335.55s -> 337.79s]  Get in the car.
[337.79s -> 339.79s]  Get in the car this instant, young man.
[339.79s -> 342.42s]  No.
[342.42s -> 344.42s]  I got a call from Mrs. Rogerson.
[344.42s -> 346.42s]  Are you going to get a B- on your math exam?
[346.42s -> 348.42s]  No.
[348.42s -> 350.42s]  You get in this car right now.
[350.42s -> 352.42s]  No.
[352.42s -> 354.42s]  Your father is going to hear about this and he is going to lose his shit.
[354.42s -> 356.42s]  No.
[356.42s -> 358.42s]  Are you going to make me come all the way into the hotel?
[358.42s -> 361.68s]  Yeah.
[361.68s -> 363.68s]  I don't even like this hotel.
[363.68s -> 366.43s]  They don't even serve breakfast.
[366.43s -> 368.43s]  This thing is going to go.
[368.43s -> 370.43s]  If you touch a wall, all of your gamer skills are coming together right now.
[370.43s -> 372.43s]  All of my gamer skills need to be here.
[372.43s -> 374.43s]  I'm playing Operation.
[374.43s -> 376.43s]  Operation.
[376.43s -> 378.43s]  The thing with the naked guy that lies on the table and you have to pull his bones out.
[378.43s -> 380.43s]  We're playing that right now.
[380.43s -> 382.74s]  No.
[382.74s -> 384.74s]  That game where you pull bones out of...
[384.74s -> 386.91s]  Operation.
[386.91s -> 388.91s]  I don't think I can even go out here.
[388.91s -> 390.91s]  It's buzzing so loud right now.
[390.91s -> 393.60s]  I've lost so many times.
[393.60s -> 395.60s]  This is the guys femur.
[395.60s -> 397.60s]  That was always the hardest one.
[397.60s -> 400.29s]  The femur was the hardest one for me.
[400.29s -> 402.29s]  Mom, I don't want to go into the hotel.
[402.29s -> 404.29s]  You're in big trouble, mister.
[404.29s -> 406.29s]  I've come all the way into the hotel to get you.
[406.29s -> 408.29s]  And now I've got you.
[408.29s -> 410.29s]  And you're not going to even get your cereal.
[410.29s -> 412.59s]  Just like in GTA.
[412.59s -> 414.59s]  Take out the driver.
[414.59s -> 417.86s]  I'm alright.
[421.89s -> 424.32s]  He ate those all in one bite.
[424.32s -> 427.26s]  Easy.
[427.26s -> 430.72s]  What the fuck?
[430.72s -> 437.25s]  I got you something.
[437.25s -> 439.25s]  I got you a burrito from Taco Bell.
[439.25s -> 441.25s]  It's Chalupa.
[441.25s -> 443.94s]  Try it out.
[443.94s -> 445.94s]  It's really good stuff.
[449.97s -> 452.85s]  What are you doing?
