[0.31s -> 15.97s]  I'm just gonna stick this medigun up your ass and we're gonna kill everybody. That sounds fine. I'll grab
[16.85s -> 20.67s]  the righteous bison
[22.27s -> 32.57s]  Oh, you can juggle I didn't know you could juggle Jerma. I learned how to the other day when I was bored waiting for my
[33.73s -> 42.34s]  Anal exam. Oh, really? How'd that go? They put the juggled in my butt. What's a juggle? Oh
[43.38s -> 45.38s]  Right. We were just talking about juggling
[45.98s -> 47.74s]  I
[47.74s -> 49.74s]  Don't know that it's a noun but I mean
[50.74s -> 57.48s]  The juggle is it time? Is it time here? Is it time? Yeah, not yet. Not yet. Not yet. Not yet
[57.48s -> 62.94s]  Not yet. Use it. Yeah, I needed it for that ng because screw ng's watch up on a scope
[66.10s -> 70.94s]  No one here now. Yeah. Oh backstab. Watch out turn around turn around. I was
[72.51s -> 76.77s]  Could have gone better. It was like a whole nest up there a second ago
[76.81s -> 78.81s]  Could have sworn at least yeah
[79.69s -> 85.46s]  Things. Hey, that's all that matters shot a guy killed an engineer
[85.70s -> 91.42s]  That's top priority mini century engineer. That is like not priority number one
[94.51s -> 97.57s]  That sounds smash, you know, we're gonna go around the round the back
[97.57s -> 101.83s]  It's right for that spy too, cuz he's like always killing me because I'm Jerma
[116.78s -> 122.46s]  I got a double kill at the crit rocket. Like I was standing there just like waiting to see who would hit and I got
[122.46s -> 123.38s]  Me killed
[123.38s -> 124.79s]  Yeah
[124.79s -> 129.87s]  That was very very crazy looking on my screen. It looks like you just disconnected from the game
[130.31s -> 134.59s]  Are you dead? No, I'm alive. I made it out
[135.25s -> 136.53s]  he's
[136.53s -> 140.41s]  Connach I feel like I've done nothing. Oh
[141.45s -> 146.91s]  Bye. I was like, are you ready? You ready Jerma? No, not yet. There's no one here. Oh
[147.73s -> 154.75s]  Let me heal this guy
[157.65s -> 164.32s]  Boy, oh boy. I'm gonna die. I had to run. Okay. I'm coming with you. Where you be? I'm on the cart
[164.32s -> 166.40s]  I'm just trying to get some help. Oh, I forgot I had them
[173.80s -> 178.58s]  What keeps happening to you, I don't know but at least I'm doing it spectacularly
[178.58s -> 184.15s]  I mean if you're gonna die make a scene of it and
[185.15s -> 192.23s]  We need like a bug we'd like six snipers standing in the same spot for you to get like a quadruple to the kill
[198.86s -> 200.38s]  Oh
[200.38s -> 208.84s]  Oh, he jumped down going for it. Oh you oh, he took so much damage. Let's back up. We can't be here
[208.84s -> 211.38s]  This is scary gonna get on that cat. Oh
[212.22s -> 218.58s]  No, they're kind of like camping them. Maybe we can stay here kind of where's the red team?
[218.58s -> 228.65s]  I don't know. Where the hell is the other team? What's going on? Oh, I got this reload the bison and here it goes
[229.37s -> 236.35s]  Use it going up. Oh
[237.80s -> 244.63s]  That was pretty oh back step. That's okay. I think we we are winners. I'm gonna go scalp
[245.03s -> 249.03s]  I'm gonna go scale just a run on the cot just sprint on it. Oh, yeah
[249.03s -> 254.98s]  I got him pretty good here at spawn. This is how we do it
[265.97s -> 274.30s]  Top frag again, I'll play the Solomon
[276.96s -> 283.88s]  Soldier is a spy. The heavy is a spy. The heavy is a sniper. What?
[285.40s -> 286.88s]  Good job
[286.88s -> 290.96s]  Should have played harder. What did he just like shoot him in the friggin door?
[290.96s -> 295.12s]  There was like a hundred of them at the gate like how they always placed them there
[295.12s -> 299.08s]  Yeah, I was like I was like standing where the train tracks are like I would do like behind the cart
[299.08s -> 301.60s]  Oh, I think that some of them got blown back by an explosion
[302.40s -> 303.48s]  Okay
[303.48s -> 305.08s]  Makes sense
[305.08s -> 310.79s]  There we go. Pray. I love your rock anybody in there
[310.81s -> 318.62s]  I'm you I'm also birding to death somebody in there somebody in there. I just heard like I heard the ding
[318.62s -> 323.10s]  I heard the ding. What's the ding it goes dings? Which class did oh the ding?
[323.10s -> 330.87s]  I heard a ding. Oh a lot of stuff going on up here
[330.87s -> 339.48s]  I love all that guy just thought this was an actual built dispenser. I've done that so many times before
[339.48s -> 344.32s]  I keep thinking that like I'm not used to that yet. I've seen the sentries do that
[344.84s -> 351.36s]  What way dispensers are newer you think they would fix that you think they wouldn't fix like the invisible players
[351.64s -> 361.44s]  You think they would fix a lot of things like heavies hands disappearing valve. What the heck man
[361.68s -> 370.10s]  Hey, come up left with me. We got to be one again. Come over here. I'm right over here. Yeah, is it good?
[370.10s -> 372.10s]  Hey, let's go adventure
[374.72s -> 379.00s]  There's way for this to open wait. Just wait here. Just just crouch in the corner with me
[379.00s -> 383.44s]  We're gonna have a good time. Don't shoot hold your fight. Okay. Oh
[384.16s -> 395.95s]  Mini century don't think so. I think we're winning. I'm damn looks like it. We have the heavy
[396.21s -> 400.71s]  No, don't you think about it? Don't you think about it?
[400.71s -> 417.38s]  I am in desperate need of a medic big time or this health back. Thank many century. Where are you where?
[418.14s -> 424.93s]  There's a mini century in that gray gravel Co building and I'm afraid to go over and do anything about it
[424.93s -> 441.23s]  Oh, it's gone. Hey, I could smell you scout right behind you. Just keep walking forward. Oh
[443.69s -> 444.77s]  Sentry
