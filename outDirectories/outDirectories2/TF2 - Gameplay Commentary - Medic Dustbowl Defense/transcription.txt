[1.27s -> 7.89s]  Hello, everybody. It is Jerma again. I've got a medic gameplay for you today or
[8.89s -> 13.67s]  Tonight I've done like three of these in a row, but um this is on gold rush
[15.47s -> 21.19s]  People hate gold rush people think it's dumb people think it's newbish people think but whatever you know a lot of people think the
[21.19s -> 23.59s]  Things that I do potentially be newbish, but I don't care
[25.17s -> 27.27s]  Before I start I think this is really funny
[27.87s -> 29.87s]  this sniper up here
[30.23s -> 32.23s]  Kept on getting hit over and over and over again
[32.59s -> 36.87s]  By a scout that was going into the resupply and getting a ball and hitting him over and over again
[37.15s -> 41.43s]  Like I thought that was great, and I'm gonna start to do that because I think it's funny
[41.79s -> 47.17s]  But I'm medic with Chris Krieg and the Crusaders crossbow and the ubersaw
[48.11s -> 51.63s]  Kind of an odd combination, but I hate the Blutzogger. I think it just gives you
[52.51s -> 56.63s]  Good for battle medics not good for people like me that don't really like to shoot
[57.11s -> 61.59s]  I mean, I'm pretty aggressive as a medic, but I don't like you know shooting people with
[62.39s -> 68.03s]  Like needle guns or the crossbows I do it every so often but not as much as I want to I crits this engineer
[68.03s -> 72.79s]  Because there's a reason for it there were no real offensive people on the team
[72.79s -> 78.95s]  It was I think the two pyros and like three engineers and three snipers or something
[78.95s -> 82.63s]  So it was kind of hard to to get anyone I get this soldier though
[82.95s -> 86.51s]  Which was I was pretty proud of that I was actually surprised that he didn't kill me
[86.75s -> 89.07s]  But um I think I fixed the audio
[90.51s -> 96.07s]  Softness from the last video the first one that I did and the video should be a little clearer now, too
[96.07s -> 97.23s]  hopefully
[97.23s -> 100.95s]  But let's get back to talking about this this by his is dead. No he's not
[101.47s -> 105.75s]  I remember because I remember this part. I freaked out because I didn't expect to get ubered and
[107.03s -> 109.03s]  after getting ubered you know
[109.31s -> 113.63s]  you think that the person would stick with you maybe for at least a second or two, but I he was doing the
[114.43s -> 120.55s]  Typical you know run around and uber like eight people in one shot. You know what I mean, but I crits this pyro
[120.55s -> 125.43s]  He kills one person and then just stands here, and I'm saying over Mike
[125.43s -> 132.27s]  I keep saying dude. What are you doing like and we lose somebody caps it behind us, and I think right here
[132.27s -> 136.51s]  I was complaining to that pyro saying things like you did a wonderful job
[136.59s -> 140.03s]  And I commend you for your hard work, but he was just standing there
[140.03s -> 143.03s]  I don't know if it was like somebody messaged him or something
[143.51s -> 145.99s]  He killed somebody and it was just standing there
[146.83s -> 148.39s]  whatever
[148.39s -> 150.55s]  This is the next part of dust bowl
[151.07s -> 157.47s]  I'm sticking with the medic. This is gonna be mostly medic gameplay. This is actually pretty cool. How we do this we
[158.11s -> 161.11s]  We don't really have any sentry guns built up these and one of these engineers
[161.11s -> 166.51s]  I think skit gets one in the very end of the gameplay, but for the most part we do not have a
[168.19s -> 170.35s]  Viable sentry gun so I
[170.43s -> 175.11s]  End up rocking with a soldier, and we we do pretty well
[175.63s -> 180.19s]  It's this guy up here. He's he seems like he's a pretty smart guy, and he doesn't want the crits Creek
[180.19s -> 183.31s]  He's like. I don't think I want this you'll hear him. It's pretty funny watch ready. Oh
[184.43s -> 192.24s]  Come on say it
[192.24s -> 193.76s]  He's like okay
[193.76s -> 197.08s]  Where is it? Come on say it
[198.24s -> 202.52s]  There it is. I do not promise anything, and I keep saying it's all right, dude
[202.52s -> 205.88s]  Just go so he shoots a couple of rockets in there crits. He kills one or two people I think
[206.48s -> 208.48s]  Which I'm totally fine with
[209.16s -> 211.92s]  It is the you know the opening of the doors you know
[212.32s -> 218.32s]  There's nothing really unless you give me ubers are popping out and stuff like that unless you're like some crazy person
[218.32s -> 220.32s]  It's hard to kill a lot of people because most people stay back
[220.64s -> 224.68s]  You get a couple of people that will just run out, but not very many see I'm pretty scared right here
[224.68s -> 229.20s]  I get like stuck on the stairs. I think I'm gonna get killed because their whole team started to come out
[231.08s -> 235.38s]  And I make my way out of here I figure oh, we're still you know they're all out there and
[235.88s -> 240.08s]  This is a spy hi, and I kill him, and then I took a walk out here
[240.08s -> 244.36s]  And it's like oh my tea. Oh my god, and it's their whole team and I
[245.00s -> 250.40s]  Die and if you're wondering I have the medic girl hair. I think it's the funniest thing in the world
[250.40s -> 255.88s]  I will never take it off. I think it's so funny go the wrong way with this soldier for a second
[256.36s -> 258.36s]  Don't know why I played this map
[258.84s -> 260.84s]  at least 500 times
[261.40s -> 266.32s]  But as you can see we are trying to defend for like 16 minutes
[266.32s -> 269.00s]  I I don't understand why people do that I
[269.76s -> 273.84s]  Assist on killing this engineer this spy I get him
[274.44s -> 278.56s]  But oh boy. I'm out of here. I I don't understand why why servers
[279.56s -> 285.40s]  Make it 16 17 20 minutes still for defense times. It's just stupid. I don't know it
[285.68s -> 289.84s]  It's just it doesn't make any sense like Chris this guy. I thought we were gonna lose he gets backstabbed
[290.16s -> 295.88s]  I go on this guy instead doesn't matter. He was using the direct hit which is not the best thing to crits
[295.88s -> 298.08s]  But he was the only thing right there
[298.52s -> 303.32s]  He the guy said sorry Jerma, and I just was like it's all right. There's nothing we could have done
[304.40s -> 307.70s]  But that was the first time that they had a good push, and we stopped it
[308.02s -> 311.44s]  And it happens to quite a few times actually happens at least two or three more times
[312.26s -> 316.94s]  Spy snaps that engineer, but I can't do anything about it. I can't be bothered with that right now
[317.82s -> 321.78s]  But yeah, they they they do two or three really really big pushes
[321.78s -> 327.14s]  And we don't even have a sentry gun, and we seem to stop it. I was pretty amazed by that. I thought it was really cool
[327.70s -> 329.70s]  But they are really starting to push now
[330.74s -> 333.24s]  Spy gets on the point, but he dies immediately
[334.56s -> 339.76s]  see right now, this is this is where they're they're really starting to push and
[341.68s -> 346.80s]  Obviously I thought we were gonna die, so I'm just kind of standing around healing anyone I can and
[347.48s -> 351.96s]  It's at this point. We know when most people kind of just give up and they go let him cap it whatever
[352.72s -> 358.60s]  But we kind of were pretty resilient. We didn't we didn't let anybody take nothing from us
[358.60s -> 363.64s]  I got that soldier with a good crit and I I know I don't like the ubersaw that much
[363.64s -> 369.32s]  I think it's a I think it's fun, but I mean I know it just makes me a bad medic
[369.32s -> 374.64s]  And that was a complete fail over crits right there not over as a complete fail crits right there
[375.60s -> 380.12s]  Both on both parts my part and his part. I probably should have told him. I was doing it. I just kind of did it
[381.28s -> 383.28s]  but like I was saying before I
[384.28s -> 390.64s]  I'm not a big fan of the ubersaw because it makes you really start to think aggressively and you'll jump into fucking death
[390.88s -> 392.78s]  You know I mean like oh, I got my ubersaw
[392.78s -> 398.72s]  I want another uber for free and you'll just start swinging madly and get yourself killed which I do quite often when I have
[398.72s -> 403.68s]  The ubersaw and I get back stabbed right there. I bumped into a spy, but I was too stupid to think about it
[404.72s -> 408.85s]  So I'm gonna get near the end of this gameplay here in another minute or two
[409.77s -> 412.46s]  these guys really start to push and
[413.22s -> 418.38s]  Like I said we push them back a couple times and I was pretty impressed with the team
[419.18s -> 425.02s]  Holding this point right here without a sentry gun because usually this place just drops within a second of it being available
[425.02s -> 427.02s]  You know what I mean like right now. It should be over
[427.82s -> 430.51s]  we stick with it and
[430.67s -> 436.31s]  Ultimately, I'm gonna spoil it for you like I just said I'm gonna end it soon because we lose and it's right here
[436.39s -> 437.95s]  Oh, no, maybe not
[437.95s -> 439.95s]  Jerma saves the day
[440.19s -> 444.53s]  But it's ill-fated. I crits this guy one more time. I think we get a couple more kills with it
[444.91s -> 448.07s]  He kills this push that they were had on the right side here
[449.11s -> 451.11s]  Four or five kills actually it was pretty good
[452.43s -> 458.91s]  But it ends up not being enough because as you can see how all of us are at like less than 15% health
[460.40s -> 461.92s]  so
[461.92s -> 466.60s]  they push and push and push and we pull
[466.92s -> 468.84s]  I guess you could say
[468.84s -> 470.76s]  No
[470.76s -> 475.96s]  We stopped it one more time. That was the last time we stopped it and this is when it starts to get ugly
[477.40s -> 483.16s]  You GL why you ain't got no alibi because you are fucking ugly
[485.28s -> 489.64s]  It's hard to do commentary for a medic because you don't you kind of really do the same things over and over again
[489.92s -> 494.22s]  You know you kind of just yeah, I like it. I wouldn't be able to do like a scope sniper
[494.78s -> 499.82s]  Commentary because you don't mean you yeah, I scoped in I shot that guy and it's actually pretty cool
[499.82s -> 503.10s]  We got rid of their the medic was in this tunnel back here
[503.10s -> 506.82s]  And we got rid of the medic and we got rid of the it was a heavy and a pyro
[506.82s -> 510.26s]  So we ruin this push, but yeah, it's good. Oh
[512.14s -> 514.14s]  Backs to have our us
[514.62s -> 516.62s]  That's a good spy. He got me a couple times
[517.34s -> 520.94s]  but yeah, like I said, it's kind of hard to do to do commentary for medic only because
[521.50s -> 524.26s]  You're kind of just running around you know over healing people and
[525.18s -> 530.38s]  Unless you really start to swing people and swing people you know you take them to swing lessons
[530.54s -> 534.06s]  Unless you really start to to go crazy with like you know
[534.90s -> 540.18s]  Like you use the blue soccer or the needle gun and you get like ten kills in one life like a battle medic or something
[540.58s -> 546.10s]  But for the most part it's hard to do commentary and lose at the same time like we just did
[546.78s -> 548.02s]  But yeah
[548.02s -> 554.86s]  Hopefully you guys enjoyed this video, and if you did let me know like subscribe do whatever you want, but yeah
[554.90s -> 556.90s]  There's more coming
