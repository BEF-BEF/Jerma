[0.31s -> 15.70s]  Hey, what's going on everybody? Welcome to episode 3 of The Binding of Isaac, German Let's Play.
[15.70s -> 25.13s]  Not really a Let's Play in parentheses. So, I took a lot of you guys' advice, and I'm not using the mouse anymore, as you can probably tell.
[25.13s -> 30.13s]  I'm using the keys, and it is actually a little easier to move around, so thank you for that.
[30.13s -> 35.13s]  And I'm also not going to miss any secret rooms, or I'm going to try not to miss any secret rooms.
[35.13s -> 41.67s]  So, I died, as you just saw in the last episode. So, let's start it, huh?
[41.67s -> 50.10s]  Alright, that's fine. Coins, I can't get you. Maybe later. Bug bitches.
[50.10s -> 57.62s]  So yeah, a lot of you guys were like, oh my god, you're missing so many secrets. And I am sorry.
[57.62s -> 64.05s]  I did kind of just jump into this game without really thinking about it a whole lot. So I'll try to keep that to a minimum now.
[64.05s -> 74.27s]  Can't get those right now. Let's go up. Okay. Oh, there it is. See, there's the blue tinted rock.
[74.27s -> 79.27s]  A lot of you guys said, look for the blue tinted rock, so there's one right there. I'll remember this room.
[79.27s -> 87.59s]  Let's go to the right. I've never seen these enemies before. Like jumping jack freak shows.
[87.59s -> 97.52s]  Oh my, it is so much easier to aim with the arrow keys. Oh, and you also said to hit the chocolate syrup, because there could be items in there.
[98.52s -> 107.03s]  So I will. Item boss? Really? This is it? That's not very many rooms.
[107.03s -> 116.78s]  First item. Mr. Boom. Mr. Boom. So that's not a bomb. That's... it is.
[116.78s -> 124.45s]  Should I blow up the thing to get the thing? I don't know. I'm gonna do it. Whatever.
[124.45s -> 135.37s]  Small rock has appeared in the basement. Ooh, damage up. There you go. Oh, that's morbid.
[135.37s -> 141.49s]  Oh my god. There's a rock sticking out of my head. So that's awesome. That's awesome.
[141.49s -> 146.49s]  So when you blow up the tinted rocks, items can go up. I'm cool with that.
[146.49s -> 152.82s]  So that's it. There's nothing else. Wow. Okay. Isaac versus Monstro.
[152.82s -> 159.25s]  I've already beat this guy. I know what he does. Let's go. Yeah, go ahead. Come on. Come on. What you got?
[159.25s -> 164.49s]  You ain't got nothing, you friggin' goofy-toothed bastard. Keep puking.
[164.49s -> 172.46s]  Keep puking. All right. The damage up is... I can tell it's doing more damage. Oh god, I'm getting hit.
[172.46s -> 177.90s]  Wow. So definitely they'll spirit... Oh, I hit a spirit heart. That's cool.
[177.90s -> 183.42s]  What do you got, Mastro? Oh, it is. This is so much better.
[183.42s -> 190.39s]  Using the mouse was just so counterintuitive. I got you. Nothing.
[190.39s -> 195.76s]  I am gonna beat this stupid level. Not level, I mean this series of levels.
[195.76s -> 201.47s]  And you are dead. What do I get? What do I get? What do I get?
[201.47s -> 207.93s]  Underwear. Mom's underwear. Oh my god. I look ridiculous.
[211.50s -> 217.66s]  Oh, let's keep going. The basement. Level two.
[217.66s -> 221.09s]  Let me take a sip of my delicious soda pop.
[221.09s -> 227.22s]  All right, I'm ready to go. Up or down? All right, I'll go up. I heard you.
[227.22s -> 230.22s]  I heard you through the computer screen. You said to go up.
[230.22s -> 237.26s]  You guys, what do you got? Were these... Okay, somebody in the comments want to let me know.
[237.26s -> 242.26s]  These characters, these guys that look like the fluffy cauliflowers.
[242.26s -> 245.26s]  Were they in another game? Or in another series or something?
[245.26s -> 251.26s]  I feel like, cause Edward McMillan, or McMullin, is the guy that is the artistic brains behind all this.
[251.26s -> 255.74s]  And, oh my god. Should I go in?
[255.74s -> 261.43s]  I'm going to the item room. I have a key. I'm going in here. Hell yeah.
[261.43s -> 266.06s]  Bobby bomb. Homing bombs? What the hell does that mean?
[266.06s -> 269.06s]  I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna knock this out of the park.
[269.06s -> 273.06s]  I can't even... I need a key. Damn it.
[273.06s -> 278.30s]  It's all right. But yeah, Edward McMullin is the guy responsible for this game.
[278.30s -> 282.54s]  So I figured a lot of these guys must be from a lot of his other works.
[282.54s -> 285.54s]  And I just opened up the floodgates right there. I don't know if that was a good idea.
[285.54s -> 289.04s]  I got it. Come on. Oh, the green one.
[289.04s -> 293.04s]  Somebody told me the green ones are like worth more. Ooh.
[293.04s -> 299.25s]  They were. They totally were. Doing good so far. So far so good.
[299.25s -> 303.75s]  Oh, damn it. Die already.
[303.75s -> 308.38s]  Geez Louise with a piece of cheese. Nice.
[308.38s -> 312.38s]  Nothing in the chocolate syrup. I'm going to go open that chest.
[312.38s -> 316.94s]  I am absolutely going to go open that chest right now and probably get my ass kicked.
[316.94s -> 319.94s]  What is it? A bunch of... Oh, that was...
[319.94s -> 325.20s]  I don't know if I like that. I also read somebody said to not use the bombs
[325.20s -> 329.20s]  just to kill random enemies. You need them later or something somebody mentioned.
[329.20s -> 333.20s]  So I will heed by that advice and I will not do it.
[333.20s -> 338.66s]  Look at these crying babies. Oh, no. Did I really get hit by that?
[338.66s -> 344.66s]  Bilarki. Oh, man.
[344.66s -> 348.90s]  I'm going to cook you on an open fire, baby. And another chest.
[348.90s -> 353.79s]  And I don't need any of it. I'm going to go down.
[353.79s -> 358.21s]  I'm not going to go right. I'm going to go down.
[358.21s -> 362.47s]  I'm not sure if that was a great idea or not. Not sure.
[362.47s -> 365.47s]  But yeah, I swear to God, I've seen these guys from something else.
[365.47s -> 369.74s]  So in the comments, let me know what I'm talking about.
[369.74s -> 374.04s]  If I'm crazy, I'm crazy. If not, then I've seen them somewhere.
[374.04s -> 379.70s]  I think I'm going to go down. Oh, well, you get over here.
[379.70s -> 382.26s]  You rat bastard. Get over here.
[382.26s -> 387.08s]  Good to go. Getting stuck on these rocks.
[387.08s -> 392.93s]  These things remind me of fleas. Oh, a chest. Cool.
[392.93s -> 397.83s]  Coins, coins, coins.
[397.83s -> 400.78s]  See, okay, this is crazy.
[400.78s -> 407.02s]  The last level that I did was like less than like five rooms.
[407.02s -> 409.02s]  Ooh, pills. All right.
[409.02s -> 413.96s]  Somebody also said don't take the pills because it could be bad.
[413.96s -> 416.71s]  What? What? What is going on?
[416.71s -> 419.95s]  This is a boss? This is not a boss room.
[419.95s -> 421.95s]  What is going on here?
[421.95s -> 423.95s]  Oh, my God.
[423.95s -> 425.95s]  This game is just trolling me right now.
[425.95s -> 431.10s]  It is a troll. It's a troll face.
[431.10s -> 436.26s]  I'm going to die. Oh, boy.
[436.26s -> 439.07s]  So what? This is like a mini boss room?
[439.07s -> 441.07s]  Get the hell out of here. No.
[441.07s -> 444.07s]  Damn it. I'm going to die. No, God.
[444.07s -> 449.09s]  Geez. Oh, Q the fool.
[449.09s -> 452.22s]  Which one of these should I take?
[452.22s -> 457.41s]  I need heart. I have no idea what this does.
[457.41s -> 459.71s]  Somebody's probably screaming at the video right now.
[459.71s -> 461.71s]  Pick the pills back up.
[461.71s -> 464.27s]  I'm not going to. I'm keeping this thing.
[464.27s -> 468.70s]  I need life. Oh, if I die right now, I'm going to I'm going to throw up blood.
[468.70s -> 470.70s]  Blood is going to puke out of my mouth.
[470.70s -> 473.70s]  I'm going to hit Q. I'm doing it.
[473.70s -> 477.21s]  What? What just happened?
