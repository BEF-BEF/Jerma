[0.31s -> 17.38s]  Hey, what's going on everybody? It's Dr. Jermick here, at my desk using my mouse and my keyboard going to put some patient files into the directory.
[17.38s -> 25.87s]  Let's see here. Anyways, I'm a doctor now. As you know, I have my doctorate in surgery.
[25.87s -> 37.00s]  Oh, let me just get this telephone here for a second. Hello? I don't care. I'm a goddamn doctor now. Get this phone off the desk.
[38.00s -> 40.62s]  Oh, everything must go.
[40.62s -> 47.57s]  We are going to do an ambulance mission. Now what this is, you will see very shortly.
[47.57s -> 55.87s]  In addition to the original game, you can do stuff in ambulances, and I've never done it before, and it's incredibly difficult and crazy.
[55.87s -> 59.87s]  So here we go. Gonna do the transplant, heart transplant, in the ambulance. Here we go, baby.
[59.87s -> 69.65s]  Get this off. Thank you. So far so good. How am I gonna do this here?
[69.65s -> 72.59s]  I should probably...
[72.59s -> 76.28s]  Hey, like, watch the potholes, asshole guy driving the car.
[76.28s -> 80.22s]  Okay, the back of the door just opened. Are you serious?
[80.22s -> 89.99s]  Come on. What are we doing? Are we on like a roller coaster right now or a road?
[89.99s -> 92.99s]  No, I'm gonna lose my tools. Hold on. Where's the...
[92.99s -> 94.99s]  Wait, there it is.
[94.99s -> 97.99s]  Come here. Come here.
[97.99s -> 99.99s]  Come here.
[99.99s -> 100.99s]  Pick it up.
[100.99s -> 102.99s]  Okay, here we go.
[102.99s -> 105.74s]  Nice and easy. Nice and easy.
[105.74s -> 109.97s]  Get me into that rib cage.
[109.97s -> 113.97s]  Hey, can you, like, stop at a Taco Bell while you're at it? I'm, like, kind of hungry.
[113.97s -> 118.53s]  Jesus Christ.
[118.53s -> 123.98s]  I'm gonna kill this guy.
[123.98s -> 127.42s]  I'm legitimately going to kill this guy.
[127.42s -> 129.42s]  I almost got the rib cage done.
[129.42s -> 132.10s]  Get this out of here.
[132.10s -> 136.62s]  Get this glass tube off the guy. Come on.
[136.62s -> 139.62s]  Hold on, I gotta... I gotta start to move some of this stuff.
[139.62s -> 142.62s]  Do not lose this. Put it down right there.
[142.62s -> 145.44s]  Here, we'll, like, throw this at an oncoming car.
[145.44s -> 148.81s]  Well, the doors don't even open anymore.
[148.81s -> 152.56s]  Okay, good, good, good. So far, so good.
[152.56s -> 156.06s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[156.06s -> 160.38s]  No, no. I still need to open this.
[160.38s -> 163.46s]  Come here.
[163.46s -> 165.46s]  And everyone thinks I'm on drugs.
[165.46s -> 168.46s]  The whole point of this game is... Oh, great, there's a saw in his body.
[168.46s -> 171.46s]  The whole point of this game is you're supposed to be, like, a guy on drugs.
[171.46s -> 173.46s]  Like, that's the joke.
[173.46s -> 176.46s]  Where's the guy driving the car? How many beers did this guy have?
[176.46s -> 180.41s]  Come on.
[180.41s -> 182.41s]  No, I'm gonna lose this guy already.
[182.41s -> 186.68s]  Here we go, here we go. That's what I want.
[186.68s -> 188.86s]  That's what I want.
[188.86s -> 190.86s]  Just shut up for a second, car.
[190.86s -> 192.86s]  Get that toaster out of the way.
[192.86s -> 195.61s]  Where's the heart?
[195.61s -> 198.10s]  Where's his heart?
[198.10s -> 200.10s]  Where's the heart that I was supposed to transplant?
[200.10s -> 202.54s]  Did it go out the back door?
[202.54s -> 205.48s]  Oh, it's already over.
[205.48s -> 208.04s]  He's losing a lot of blood. It's necessary, though.
[208.04s -> 210.04s]  It's completely necessary.
[210.04s -> 214.57s]  No, hold on to it still.
[214.57s -> 216.57s]  Don't I have... Where's my syringe?
[216.57s -> 218.57s]  I need to, like, feed this guy drugs so he doesn't die.
[218.57s -> 221.83s]  Almost, almost.
[221.83s -> 223.83s]  No, come on.
[223.83s -> 226.82s]  All right, where's the syringe?
[226.82s -> 229.77s]  There it is, there it is. Come here.
[229.77s -> 232.01s]  Come here. Come on, stick him in his face.
[232.01s -> 235.96s]  Yes. Yes.
[235.96s -> 238.26s]  We're good. We are good.
[238.26s -> 240.26s]  Just need to cool it here.
[240.26s -> 242.57s]  Don't want to lose the hearts right here.
[242.57s -> 244.57s]  Oh, no. God, that heart's gonna fly out the back.
[244.57s -> 246.57s]  Protect the heart. Protect the heart for the time being.
[246.57s -> 248.74s]  Okay, the doors are closed.
[248.74s -> 251.56s]  God damn.
[251.56s -> 255.34s]  Get out of the way.
[255.34s -> 257.34s]  I still gotta get those two pieces of ribs out of there.
[257.34s -> 260.54s]  I gotta get those, like, riblets from chilies out of there.
[260.54s -> 263.80s]  All right, so far so good.
[263.80s -> 265.80s]  So far so good. So far so good.
[265.80s -> 268.42s]  No, I need to cut those. I still need to cut those.
[268.42s -> 270.42s]  No, don't put that...
[270.42s -> 272.42s]  No, come here.
[272.42s -> 275.18s]  This thing's gotta go.
[275.18s -> 278.12s]  This is gonna fly into his face and kill him.
[278.12s -> 281.18s]  Come over here. Where's the scalpel?
[281.18s -> 283.61s]  I just need a scalpel.
[283.61s -> 286.49s]  Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha.
[286.49s -> 288.49s]  No.
[288.49s -> 290.49s]  No.
[290.49s -> 293.37s]  No, I just got hit with the drugs.
[293.37s -> 295.37s]  This is gonna be ten times more difficult now
[295.37s -> 297.54s]  because I am on, like,
[297.54s -> 299.54s]  whatever the hell it is, morphine.
[299.54s -> 303.45s]  No, dude.
[303.45s -> 305.45s]  Are you serious? I was so close.
[305.45s -> 308.39s]  I don't even know what I'm cutting into right now.
[308.39s -> 312.36s]  Hopefully his heart.
[312.36s -> 314.36s]  This is gonna make me die.
[314.36s -> 317.56s]  I'm gonna throw up looking at this.
[317.56s -> 319.56s]  Is the heart free? I can't even see.
[319.56s -> 321.56s]  Is the heart free? I have no idea.
[321.56s -> 325.38s]  Let's see if I can pull it out.
[325.38s -> 330.30s]  Nope. Easy.
[330.30s -> 332.30s]  I just gotta cut into the...
[332.30s -> 334.30s]  This is gonna be really bad, guys.
[334.30s -> 336.73s]  Where is a scalpel?
[336.73s -> 339.16s]  Can I please find a scalpel
[339.16s -> 342.94s]  in this mess of an ambulance?
[342.94s -> 345.37s]  I got a tool.
[345.37s -> 348.63s]  Got a tool. Here we go.
[348.63s -> 352.47s]  Slice these ventricles. Slice these ventricles.
[354.47s -> 356.47s]  No.
[356.47s -> 358.78s]  I gotta cut one more. Cut one more.
[358.78s -> 361.34s]  Get out of the way!
[361.34s -> 365.56s]  No!
[365.56s -> 368.18s]  Good, good. Open that up. Throw all these up.
[368.18s -> 370.18s]  Out. Out. Out with you.
[370.18s -> 373.64s]  Out with you. Out with you. Out with you. Out with you.
[373.64s -> 378.31s]  I don't think I have enough blood.
[378.31s -> 380.31s]  He's gonna lose too much blood right here when I try to cut him.
[380.31s -> 388.42s]  There it is.
[388.42s -> 391.05s]  One more precise cut. Right there.
[391.05s -> 395.83s]  Right there. Right there.
[395.83s -> 401.14s]  Cut it! Now we just need to cut the ventricles.
[401.14s -> 404.15s]  I'm, like, leaning into the
[404.15s -> 406.15s]  computer right now, guys. This is, like, so intense.
[406.15s -> 411.02s]  There's one. Right? No?
[411.02s -> 417.14s]  Give me that cut.
[417.14s -> 420.07s]  Give me that cut. There it is.
[420.07s -> 423.21s]  I gotta get this last one. I got it.
[423.21s -> 425.21s]  Got it. Got it. Wait, no, did I?
[425.21s -> 427.58s]  There's one more. That red one.
[427.58s -> 430.39s]  Holy jeez! Where's the heart?
[430.39s -> 433.46s]  Where's this other heart? Come here!
[433.46s -> 436.02s]  Oh, pop it in the air.
[436.02s -> 438.02s]  No! No!
[438.02s -> 440.02s]  No, get in! Get in his
[440.02s -> 442.02s]  chest. Get in there.
[442.02s -> 445.98s]  Get in. Yes!
[445.98s -> 448.15s]  Wow, that was ridiculous.
[448.15s -> 450.15s]  That was intense. I can't even imagine doing, like, the brain
[450.15s -> 452.15s]  surgery. There's brain surgery, there's
[452.15s -> 454.15s]  kidney transplants, and heart transplants.
[454.15s -> 456.15s]  I have no idea how the hell you'd be
[456.15s -> 458.52s]  able to do that with a brain transplant one.
[458.52s -> 460.52s]  But anyways, guys, that's Surgeon Simulator 2013!
[460.52s -> 462.52s]  And, uh, it's on Steam right now.
[462.52s -> 464.76s]  I believe it is ten
[464.76s -> 466.76s]  bucks? I could be wrong. I believe it's ten dollars
[466.76s -> 468.76s]  on Steam. And I'll see you guys all next time.
[468.76s -> 470.76s]  Thank you so much for watching. Take care,
[470.76s -> 472.76s]  everybody.
