[0.00s -> 12.47s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[12.47s -> 19.03s]  This is gonna be a Huntsman sniper and a bonus clip at the very end of a Crusader's crossbow medic.
[19.03s -> 23.59s]  I got a lot of requests to do that after I mentioned it in my previous video,
[23.59s -> 26.43s]  so there will be a little bonus clip at the end here.
[26.43s -> 31.33s]  And it has to be mentioned that this is all being recorded on my laptop right now.
[31.33s -> 32.95s]  I brought a pretty nice microphone with me.
[33.35s -> 39.43s]  I'll give you the quick story. If you were not at my live stream, my fail stream last night.
[39.43s -> 45.43s]  So what happened was I had to drive nine and a half hours from Boston to North Carolina
[45.43s -> 47.83s]  because I had to bring my sister's dogs home.
[47.83s -> 52.83s]  My sister has two dogs, two fairly large dogs, not huge or anything by anybody's standards,
[52.83s -> 54.73s]  but they're pretty big, pretty wild.
[54.73s -> 58.83s]  So we had to drive them. Me and my mother had to drive them down to North Carolina
[58.83s -> 61.33s]  because you can't really put a dog on a plane anymore.
[61.33s -> 63.81s]  It's not like considered a good thing to do.
[63.81s -> 69.01s]  So we just drove them and I ended up being like 25 minutes late from my own live stream.
[69.01s -> 73.44s]  And if you did come to that live stream, I'm sorry.
[73.44s -> 75.74s]  I'm sorry that it really turned out pretty poorly.
[75.74s -> 80.04s]  I didn't really realize this laptop wasn't powerful enough to do anything.
[80.04s -> 82.54s]  We ended up playing Super Meat Boy for a little while.
[82.54s -> 85.71s]  So at least that's good. At least we played Meat Boy, right?
[85.71s -> 89.65s]  Couldn't play Team Fortress at all. It was like two frames a second.
[89.65s -> 93.95s]  But don't worry though. The good news out of this is I'm leaving here in like two days.
[93.95s -> 97.25s]  Good to see your family though. Good to visit my sister and her husband.
[97.25s -> 100.45s]  They have a really nice place in North Carolina. Really beautiful down here.
[100.45s -> 104.65s]  So it's all good. This video should go up today. I hope it does.
[104.65s -> 107.87s]  We'll see if the crap laptop can handle it or not.
[107.87s -> 110.97s]  So playing as the huntsman right now on King of the Hill Badlands,
[110.97s -> 115.57s]  I chose this gameplay because, well, as you can see, I get quite a few headshots in a row.
[115.57s -> 118.87s]  I only get like two or three body shots in the entire gameplay
[118.87s -> 123.47s]  and I kill like 16 or 17 people. I jumped into this session late.
[123.47s -> 127.47s]  I think there was like two minutes left on the other team or something like that or two minutes on our side.
[127.47s -> 130.28s]  So it's a fairly short gameplay, but it's very good.
[130.28s -> 132.58s]  So talking about the huntsman for just a second here,
[132.58s -> 137.38s]  I've been trying to get a good huntsman gameplay for at least like a week or two.
[137.38s -> 140.58s]  And I feel like the huntsman is very, very hit or miss sometimes.
[140.58s -> 144.18s]  Sometimes you'll jump in a game and you'll destroy with it.
[144.18s -> 147.08s]  And other times you'll jump in and you won't be able to hit the broad side of a bond.
[147.08s -> 149.26s]  It's a really, really interesting weapon.
[149.26s -> 153.86s]  But if you can really bear down and get in the zone, turn on the zen,
[153.86s -> 158.46s]  you can do a lot of damage with this thing because the hitboxes are very, very large.
[158.46s -> 161.96s]  Some people don't know this, but the hitboxes for the huntsman,
[161.96s -> 164.86s]  it's a giant square around your enemy target.
[164.86s -> 168.86s]  So if you shoot and hit somebody like a foot to the left of their leg,
[168.86s -> 170.16s]  you're going to hit them in the leg.
[170.16s -> 173.96s]  The boxes are enormous, especially for the head.
[173.96s -> 175.86s]  If you shoot somebody in the head with this item
[175.86s -> 179.76s]  and you happen to go maybe like four or five inches off of their ear
[179.76s -> 182.26s]  or four or five inches above their forehead,
[182.26s -> 184.96s]  you are going to headshot when you should have missed.
[184.96s -> 187.56s]  But I can totally understand why this is implemented,
[187.56s -> 192.16s]  because if it was not implemented, if it was totally 100% accurate,
[192.16s -> 195.93s]  this weapon would probably be impossible to use.
[195.93s -> 199.53s]  I also have on the Darwin's Danger Shield and not on the Jurati.
[199.53s -> 203.53s]  That is because specifically I want to be able to fight people one-on-one a little bit better
[203.53s -> 207.63s]  because King of the Hill is very chaotic and that extra health helps a lot as well.
[207.63s -> 209.13s]  Because look at my health right now.
[209.13s -> 210.63s]  I should be dead right now.
[210.63s -> 211.63s]  I should not be alive.
[211.63s -> 213.64s]  If I had 22 health, I would have been dead.
[213.64s -> 216.04s]  But so anyways, that's going to be the end of this particular gameplay.
[216.04s -> 219.34s]  Very, very nice little run as the Huntsman sniper.
[219.34s -> 220.54s]  So we're going to transition now.
[220.54s -> 222.14s]  I got a lot of requests to do this,
[222.14s -> 224.74s]  and this is an interesting gameplay coming up here.
[224.74s -> 227.34s]  I figured because I'm using the Crusader's Crossbow,
[227.34s -> 230.74s]  it makes complete sense to put it in a Huntsman gameplay.
[230.74s -> 234.24s]  I'm not really sure if I'll do a full round like this, but I might.
[234.24s -> 235.34s]  Who knows?
[235.34s -> 237.94s]  So this is a stipulation match.
[237.94s -> 239.54s]  I could turn this into a new series.
[239.54s -> 243.68s]  I actually may do that, but stipulation match, what does that mean?
[243.68s -> 248.48s]  It means I'm only allowed to use the Crusader's Crossbow and the Amputator.
[248.48s -> 251.68s]  I am not allowed to use that Kritzkrieg,
[251.68s -> 255.48s]  so I have to heal everybody and do any damage
[255.48s -> 257.28s]  only with the Crossbow and the Amputator.
[257.28s -> 259.78s]  And it actually turns out pretty well.
[259.78s -> 261.58s]  If you are unfamiliar with this item,
[261.58s -> 263.48s]  I'll give you a little bit of backstory on it.
[263.48s -> 267.96s]  I guess this item can be really described as the Team Fortress Classic item.
[267.96s -> 270.06s]  If none of you guys played Team Fortress Classic,
[270.06s -> 275.60s]  this is the only Medic item that really kind of comes from Team Fortress Classic.
[275.60s -> 277.60s]  So what you could do as a Medic in the original game
[277.60s -> 280.00s]  is you could go around and heal people
[280.00s -> 283.00s]  and you could damage your enemies with the same item.
[283.00s -> 286.60s]  Those mechanics from Team Fortress Classic came through over to this weapon
[286.60s -> 291.78s]  and I've got to say this is one of the worst loadout options for the Medic
[291.78s -> 294.38s]  and it can be okay though.
[294.38s -> 296.48s]  I will tell you why it's okay to equip this
[296.48s -> 299.48s]  because if you put the Amputator on as well,
[299.58s -> 303.08s]  you are going to see a plus one bonus to your health regeneration,
[303.08s -> 304.98s]  which can really help sometimes.
[304.98s -> 307.98s]  I've been in a lot of situations where I have the Blutsauger on
[307.98s -> 310.98s]  and I'm losing minus two health every second
[310.98s -> 313.78s]  and a lot of people don't even realize that's happening.
[313.78s -> 315.28s]  But it can be a pretty big deal.
[315.28s -> 317.68s]  If you just want to play straight up healing Medic,
[317.68s -> 319.58s]  I would say put these two things on.
[319.58s -> 322.58s]  If you're not the type of person that's going to run around with the Blutsauger out
[322.58s -> 325.88s]  or try and smash people in the face with the Ubersaw,
[325.88s -> 327.58s]  definitely put these two things on.
[327.58s -> 330.15s]  It will help you a lot when it comes to healing.
[330.15s -> 332.25s]  So talking about the gameplay for just a second here,
[332.25s -> 335.35s]  I get this Soldier killed because I couldn't get him with an arrow.
[335.35s -> 337.05s]  He was probably really mad about that
[337.05s -> 339.95s]  and if that was you, I am sorry, I do apologize for that,
[339.95s -> 342.85s]  but I get a crit right in that Scout's face
[342.85s -> 343.95s]  and this is kind of weird right here.
[343.95s -> 345.65s]  This Pyro gets on the point.
[345.65s -> 347.45s]  This is the end of the gameplay by the way
[347.45s -> 351.15s]  and a Pyro gets on here and I think he HL2.exe crashes
[351.15s -> 352.83s]  because look at him, he's just standing here.
[352.83s -> 354.63s]  I guarantee you something happened.
[354.63s -> 357.23s]  Either he lagged out or his mum was calling him for dinner or something.
[357.23s -> 361.34s]  I have no idea, but that's going to wrap it up.
[361.34s -> 363.74s]  Like I said, thank you guys so much for watching.
[363.74s -> 366.84s]  I really do appreciate it and I will see you all next time.
[366.84s -> 369.24s]  So take care everybody.
