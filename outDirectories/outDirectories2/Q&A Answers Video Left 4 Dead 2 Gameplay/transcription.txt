[0.31s -> 15.18s]  Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here with the Q&A answers video. Gonna be playing some Left 4 Dead 2 in the background.
[15.18s -> 21.18s]  I was playing with BooMan61. A lot of you guys might know who that is. He has the voice of gold, in my opinion.
[21.18s -> 26.86s]  Just wanted to have something in the background that you could watch or you could pay attention to while you hear these answers.
[27.26s -> 34.66s]  And just like my last Q&A video, gonna pick out maybe 7 or 8 good questions. Really answer them as in-depth as I possibly can.
[34.66s -> 41.04s]  Maybe pick out a couple funny ones too. But thank you everybody for your questions. I really appreciate it. So let's get this rolling, huh?
[41.04s -> 50.00s]  So the first question is going to be from Carnardo BBQ. And it was one of the top comments, so I'm gonna have to answer it.
[50.00s -> 54.78s]  It is, who is your favorite porn star? That's how we're gonna open this one up, guys.
[56.01s -> 63.99s]  Well, to be completely honest with you, I don't really have one. I don't really care too much about it that I'm like, that's my favorite one.
[63.99s -> 73.51s]  I love her so much. But yeah, I guess I don't really have one. I don't really pay a whole lot of attention to that type of thing, so I don't have one.
[73.51s -> 85.13s]  Secondly, the next question is gonna come from Aether777, which was also a top comment. He asks, have you ever met any of your fans in real life?
[85.13s -> 94.48s]  And the answer is no. I don't really actually ever plan to. And the reason why I say that is only because I'm not really that famous.
[94.48s -> 104.11s]  There's only, I think, 14, yeah, just over 14,000 people that are subscribed to this channel, so I think it would be pretty much impossible to ever run into one of my fans.
[104.11s -> 111.51s]  But if I ever did, if I ever ran into any of you guys in real life, I would shake your hand, give you a salute, and say, hey, what is up, dude?
[111.51s -> 115.68s]  And we would go get lunch, dinner, coffee, I don't know.
[115.68s -> 124.97s]  But if I ever met anybody in real life that was a fan of my channel, I would definitely treat them with respect. I would say hello, and we would talk about video games.
[124.97s -> 130.17s]  Next up, we have AdamsWeeFull, who asks, and he was not the only one who asked this question.
[130.17s -> 136.48s]  I get this question all the time, so I figured why not answer it so you guys all know the truth.
[136.48s -> 146.51s]  It's, do you have a girlfriend? And the answer is no. I do not currently have a girlfriend. I don't plan on having a girlfriend anytime soon.
[146.51s -> 148.91s]  I am single and loving it.
[148.91s -> 156.64s]  No, but I've had girlfriends in the past. I had one in college, I had one before that, I had one in high school.
[156.64s -> 164.24s]  Lately, I've kind of just stepped away from the dating game for a while, focusing on other more important things in my life.
[164.24s -> 167.40s]  So currently, no, I do not have a girlfriend.
[167.40s -> 173.40s]  So ThunderShadow991 asks, what is the stupidest thing you have ever done?
[173.40s -> 177.20s]  And I got that a lot in the comments this time, and I will answer that.
[177.40s -> 185.58s]  The stupidest thing I have ever done is probably playing the Karate Kid with my older brother downstairs on the pull-out couch.
[185.58s -> 188.08s]  Now hold on, bear with me for a second.
[188.08s -> 195.86s]  So we had a pull-out couch back when I was like probably 11 or 12 years old, and we used to play this game called the Karate Kid,
[195.86s -> 203.06s]  because obviously the Karate Kid, the old movie, not the one with Jaden Smith, the old original one, had recently come out,
[203.06s -> 206.46s]  and we loved it, we wanted to be the Karate Kid, we always were messing around,
[206.46s -> 212.70s]  but we would always do it on the pull-out couch, and we would always pretend to fly off the couch.
[212.70s -> 218.68s]  So one day, we were playing this game, and my brother got a little too close with a roundhouse kick,
[218.68s -> 227.08s]  forcing me to fly really off of the back of the couch, smashing the back of my head into our fireplace.
[227.08s -> 235.52s]  So I stood up, grabbed the back of my head, crying, and I looked at my hand, and all of a sudden I started screaming because it was covered in blood.
[235.52s -> 239.32s]  And from that point on, it was just mayhem.
[239.32s -> 245.92s]  I was screaming, blood was pouring out of my head, my parents woke up, I had to get rushed to the hospital,
[245.92s -> 252.28s]  and I had to get six staples in the back of my head, and there's still a scar there from where the staples were.
[252.28s -> 256.28s]  So that probably takes the cake for dumbest thing I've ever done.
[256.28s -> 263.35s]  So next up, I want to talk about my Team Fortress 2 server that no longer exists.
[263.35s -> 270.92s]  Now this wasn't really a question, but I get this a lot, people really want to know what the hell happened to the Team Fortress 2 server.
[270.92s -> 276.76s]  Now let me back up for a second, I want to fill in some of the new guys that probably have no idea what I'm talking about.
[276.76s -> 281.60s]  I used to have a Team Fortress 2 server, that it was open to the public, anybody could play on it,
[281.60s -> 286.51s]  I wanted to go in there, do events all the time, and for a little while it worked out okay.
[286.51s -> 288.51s]  But it had a lot of lag issues.
[288.51s -> 294.11s]  People would join the game, and then randomly, everybody would just like crash out, everyone would lag out,
[294.11s -> 295.91s]  and I didn't know what the solution was.
[295.91s -> 301.51s]  I sent in support tickets, I sent in different queries on how to fix it, and I got back a response saying,
[301.51s -> 307.11s]  oh well, we're just going to change you to a new IP, and just give the new IP to everybody else.
[307.11s -> 314.11s]  And I said, well, I just recently gave everyone this old IP, and I just didn't want to confuse everybody by being like,
[314.11s -> 316.71s]  oh yeah, remember the server I just told you to join and favorite?
[316.71s -> 319.94s]  Well, you know, erase that and then join this one.
[319.94s -> 321.94s]  Plus, it was also really, really expensive.
[321.94s -> 326.74s]  I just, I don't have the money right now to support that, so I do apologize,
[326.74s -> 331.54s]  but in the future, when I can be more sustainable with it, I will try to bring that back.
[331.54s -> 335.04s]  But as of right now, the server is closed for good.
[335.04s -> 337.01s]  So I apologize about that.
[337.01s -> 341.81s]  Following up with some more questions, this one is from Dogeese Seagawd24.
[341.81s -> 345.01s]  He asks, do you follow any sports?
[345.01s -> 346.21s]  And the answer is I do.
[346.21s -> 349.61s]  Very, very, very diehard sports fan here.
[349.61s -> 352.41s]  Big Boston Red Sox fan, big Patriots fan.
[352.41s -> 356.39s]  Funny you mention sports because the Patriots, they're in the Super Bowl.
[356.39s -> 358.79s]  They made it to the Super Bowl actually like two nights ago.
[358.79s -> 360.79s]  So that's really exciting.
[360.79s -> 363.79s]  And they're playing the New York Giants in the Super Bowl.
[363.79s -> 368.39s]  And if any of you guys are football fans, American football fans, let me rephrase that.
[368.39s -> 371.79s]  You will know that these two teams, the Patriots and the Giants,
[371.79s -> 372.99s]  this is a rematch.
[372.99s -> 377.79s]  This is a Super Bowl rematch from a few years ago, like five years ago or something like that.
[377.79s -> 379.79s]  But yeah, and we lost last time.
[379.79s -> 384.99s]  They whooped our butts in like the last two minutes of the game and I was pissed.
[384.99s -> 386.29s]  No, but yeah, this is a good rematch.
[386.29s -> 387.19s]  Should be an awesome game.
[387.19s -> 388.73s]  I cannot wait.
[388.73s -> 392.33s]  But besides football and baseball, I don't really follow any other sport.
[392.33s -> 396.03s]  It's kind of unfortunate because our hockey team, the Boston Bruins,
[396.03s -> 398.73s]  they just won the Stanley Cup this past year.
[398.73s -> 400.73s]  And I was just like, wait, what happened?
[400.73s -> 402.63s]  Who won Stanley, what, huh?
[402.63s -> 404.23s]  But yeah, I need to get back into hockey.
[404.23s -> 408.36s]  I need to find a way to make it interesting for me because we have a good team.
[408.36s -> 410.86s]  Next is a question by Kuzka.
[410.86s -> 412.26s]  I think I'm saying that right.
[412.26s -> 415.86s]  And they ask, hello, Germa, do you draw at all?
[415.86s -> 418.36s]  If so, what artists inspire you?
[418.36s -> 421.86s]  If not, do you have any favorite artists in general?
[421.86s -> 422.56s]  Now, I'll answer this.
[422.56s -> 423.86s]  I do not draw.
[423.86s -> 425.36s]  I am terrible at drawing.
[425.36s -> 428.76s]  My minor in college, believe it or not, is art.
[428.76s -> 430.36s]  But I don't know how to draw at all.
[430.36s -> 431.06s]  I'm terrible at it.
[431.06s -> 432.86s]  I can barely draw stick figures.
[432.86s -> 436.96s]  The reason why I answered this question is because do you have any favorite artists in general?
[436.96s -> 437.96s]  I do.
[437.96s -> 439.64s]  Doug Tenapel.
[439.64s -> 445.04s]  If you watched my first enlightened video, you will know that Doug Tenapel is the guy that made The Neverhood.
[445.04s -> 446.64s]  He made Earthworm Jim.
[446.64s -> 450.24s]  And he also is a very, very talented graphic novelist.
[450.24s -> 453.44s]  He makes some of the most awesome graphic novels ever.
[453.44s -> 456.64s]  He's got like, I think, maybe 15 or 20 graphic novels now.
[456.64s -> 458.34s]  And they're all really, really good.
[458.34s -> 462.24s]  So I suggest if you're into graphic novels and if you're into art in general,
[462.24s -> 466.44s]  he has an unbelievable style and you've got to check him out.
[466.44s -> 468.74s]  The next one, this one, I get this all the time as well.
[468.74s -> 470.74s]  What headset do you use?
[470.74s -> 473.72s]  I use a Turtle Beach X11 headset.
[473.72s -> 475.72s]  Gonna start answering these now a little faster,
[475.72s -> 478.82s]  try to get through another three or four before the video ends.
[478.82s -> 480.72s]  So, rapid fire mode, here we go.
[482.16s -> 485.56s]  What video game have you had the most emotional response to?
[485.56s -> 486.86s]  Chrono Trigger by far.
[486.86s -> 492.36s]  Chrono Trigger definitely got me really, really worked up at some of the parts in that game.
[492.36s -> 494.22s]  Definitely Chrono Trigger.
[494.22s -> 497.02s]  Can you lend me some of your sexiness?
[497.02s -> 499.07s]  Yeah, sure, here you go.
[499.07s -> 500.57s]  Sexiness acquired.
[500.57s -> 502.27s]  There you go, you should be good now.
[502.27s -> 504.27s]  What was your major in college?
[504.27s -> 505.27s]  Communication.
[505.27s -> 507.75s]  Communication is film, TV, and radio.
[507.75s -> 509.85s]  Somebody asked, mana mana?
[509.85s -> 513.02s]  And my answer is, do do do do do.
[513.02s -> 514.76s]  There you go.
[514.76s -> 518.86s]  And lastly, somebody asked, are you ever going to do a serious Let's Play?
[518.86s -> 520.96s]  The answer is absolutely yes.
[520.96s -> 526.36s]  When Diablo 3 comes out, I am going to do a ton of content on that game.
[526.36s -> 532.80s]  So expect a really more comprehensive Let's Play when Diablo 3 launches, who knows when.
[532.80s -> 536.00s]  But yeah, thank you guys so much for all your questions.
[536.00s -> 539.50s]  We will do another one of these in probably another couple weeks.
[539.50s -> 542.10s]  Not sure, I'll let you guys know when I want some more questions.
[542.10s -> 544.80s]  I can even pull some from here and the last video.
[544.80s -> 546.80s]  So thank you so much for watching, guys.
[546.80s -> 548.20s]  I really do appreciate it.
[548.20s -> 549.90s]  And I will see you all next time.
[549.90s -> 552.20s]  Take care, everybody.
