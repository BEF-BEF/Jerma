[392.58s -> 394.58s]  Oh god, this might be bad. I
[394.74s -> 400.43s]  Might have to kick a couple people only because my reserve slot doesn't work right now
[400.99s -> 406.01s]  Kick well, let me see. Let me see. I'm just gonna ask if anyone's cuz I'm not gonna kick anyone unless they're willing
[419.55s -> 421.55s]  See if I can get maybe one or two people
[423.97s -> 425.97s]  because I need two slots I
[426.85s -> 432.03s]  Am that fat

[475.35s -> 476.75s]  But what?
[476.75s -> 478.63s]  Really, you don't like gold rush
[478.67s -> 483.67s]  It's all right sometimes I don't know it seems like it's come up a lot every time I look at you on the server
[483.67s -> 486.23s]  It's up. Hey, let's play gold rush. Oh, I love going to rush

[509.83s -> 513.55s]  Are you leaving your server? No, I'm gonna restart it
[514.19s -> 521.28s]  Yes, that's the fairest way to do it. This is I guess this is the this is the really only way the fair way
[521.28s -> 522.84s]  No one's leaving
[522.84s -> 524.84s]  You're all getting out. It's closed
[529.24s -> 536.33s]  This is my server, but we're trying to get star in the game and my reserve slot isn't really set up correctly
[536.33s -> 537.77s]  So it doesn't work
[537.77s -> 539.77s]  So I need to restart the server
[540.13s -> 547.10s]  Just to make it so everyone can you know get in if they need to server is going to restart right now after I do this

[662.18s -> 664.18s]  only all the hours

[716.02s -> 721.46s]  I I I need to get like a custom hard like a real customer because right now this thing is like blocking my view
[721.46s -> 725.22s]  This capture and hold the control points to win the game. It's like day. I didn't know that
[726.06s -> 728.06s]  Tell me again. Oh

[743.06s -> 748.66s]  run
[748.66s -> 755.18s]  The control point is being captured. I was just assuming the item server was perpetually down
[756.02s -> 768.02s]  Yeah, it should be up. I got I got my items. Yeah, I do. So hello everybody
[769.10s -> 771.22s]  Welcome to this early Sunday stream
[771.82s -> 777.69s]  We've got special guest star here. I am going to bottom frag every time. I
[778.29s -> 783.09s]  Probably will do all I want to do is jump
[783.97s -> 786.14s]  Like jump it or all I gonna do
[788.06s -> 790.50s]  We jump this way that way oh
[793.24s -> 799.04s]  God why is it doing this? Okay, it didn't crash. It didn't crash. It's all good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good
[799.68s -> 804.06s]  All right. I'm getting shot at from somewhere. Oh
[806.66s -> 808.10s]  I'm too crazy
[808.10s -> 811.10s]  He punched me. He actually punched me
[811.70s -> 814.84s]  See I changed my setup a little bit
[814.84s -> 820.36s]  See I'm playing obviously in a window and I move the window to like the right part of my screen
[821.16s -> 824.16s]  So I'm just like look it's it's really I gotta get used to this
[824.72s -> 829.12s]  Because I have the chat on the left and I have the window I know I need two monitors so bad it
[829.12s -> 831.64s]  I can't believe I waited as long as I did the end
[832.52s -> 834.52s]  Just for streaming
[835.40s -> 841.30s]  You know, I just need I need a I need about a computer, you know
[841.30s -> 844.42s]  The problem it's the problem is my computer is just it's good
[844.42s -> 849.78s]  I have a really good computer, but it's just not good enough to do two things at the same time
[853.94s -> 861.05s]  I'm gonna go scout. We'll go and scout. What's what somebody's asking the IP. It's just in my server
[861.05s -> 863.93s]  Oh, and I got smashed right there. That's not good
[865.05s -> 867.29s]  many centuries I
[867.33s -> 872.78s]  Shouldn't even mention it with nothing. What what am I complaining about? Nothing? Nobody heard it
[874.53s -> 881.70s]  No one heard. Oh
[882.74s -> 888.66s]  Get him. I can't believe I got up and get away. Also another problem harvest event is really dark
[889.14s -> 891.14s]  So it's like hard to see anyways
[891.54s -> 898.38s]  This map is I should play it more often because I play way too much harvest, but this is like it's totally different
[899.30s -> 902.50s]  Yeah, it's like it's like a whole new world
[902.66s -> 908.47s]  Playing crit scout. Yeah
[909.15s -> 914.46s]  Can't even go over there
[914.66s -> 918.73s]  with rocket jumps
[918.73s -> 921.18s]  Rocket job. Oh
[921.18s -> 927.50s]  No, I render the damn ghost. I hate this ghost. Why is this map in my rotation? I don't know why I
[928.85s -> 933.43s]  Missed actually, it's good every now and then yeah
[934.23s -> 940.50s]  Kind of like uh, I really hate I a ducked for the fact that has pumpkins laying everywhere
[940.50s -> 944.46s]  Mm-hmm killed by a pumpkin you feel like an idiot, but I had a look amazing
[944.98s -> 946.98s]  compared to the other viaducts
[947.06s -> 951.36s]  Yeah, I I ducked is fun. Yeah, I just got killed by a pumpkin
[952.44s -> 958.79s]  Crit scout crit scout. Oh, come on. He wasn't even there before
[959.47s -> 962.66s]  That's malarkey
[963.62s -> 965.79s]  Malarkey malarkey
[971.30s -> 976.42s]  Somebody's behind me, but I want to kill the soldier. He's dead. Anyways, no, this guy's got me. This guy's got me
[976.42s -> 986.65s]  Oh, this guy's got me. Oh, no, I got him. I'm not going in there pumpkin
[988.58s -> 996.96s]  Pumpkin, I shouldn't have shot him from that far away
[997.52s -> 1001.79s]  too bad
[1001.79s -> 1008.38s]  Actually not doing too bad right now
[1009.37s -> 1012.61s]  Well, I'm doing terrible because I have a market garden anyone yet
[1013.25s -> 1016.83s]  Hey, it's all for that montage remember
[1017.86s -> 1023.65s]  Totally. I got the most amazing one yesterday
[1024.33s -> 1028.63s]  Quite literally the most amazing market gardeners probably ever happened ever
[1029.35s -> 1031.90s]  What'd you do?
[1031.90s -> 1038.55s]  It's I don't know. I don't know how to describe it, but it was for rocket jumps
[1038.55s -> 1044.31s]  I was surfing up a ramp so I was technically on the ground except it doesn't count. He was on the ground. Mm-hmm
[1046.10s -> 1048.74s]  That you know, I know man, is it the same type of thing when you when you
[1049.22s -> 1053.98s]  You know when you air blast somebody that's on an incline and they don't go anywhere but it technically they're still in the air
[1054.70s -> 1058.30s]  Yeah, it's like if anything is slanted and you rocket jump fast enough
[1058.30s -> 1063.58s]  You'll slide up it and sort of launches you off. It was the middle of sliding up something. I hit somebody
[1064.18s -> 1066.18s]  Yeah, when I use the uh
[1066.38s -> 1071.46s]  The reserve shooter I'll air blast somebody that's on an incline. They don't go anywhere, but I still get the mini crits on him
[1071.46s -> 1072.66s]  It's weird
[1072.66s -> 1081.48s]  Is the server full I believe it is I believe it is have to imagine so

[1087.61s -> 1092.54s]  whole chaos
[1092.58s -> 1098.62s]  Absolute chaos. I need health. I'm not going after that demo man with that health
[1099.26s -> 1102.42s]  What a bad I did. Why am I drinking this right here? That was a terrible idea
[1107.03s -> 1109.23s]  Pumpkin, yeah crap. Oh
[1110.43s -> 1115.70s]  That is star that is star your ears are not deceiving you
[1115.70s -> 1121.15s]  I think I just rocket jumped off a pumpkin and it was it was glorious
[1123.54s -> 1131.10s]  Is that like possible can you actually do that either that or a rocket hit me as I jumped I don't know Wow oh
[1141.45s -> 1143.29s]  I was pulling on
[1143.29s -> 1148.37s]  That was just one of those moments my whole body just shake shook shaked because I like was pulling up my melee and he
[1148.37s -> 1150.37s]  Shot me
[1151.33s -> 1154.21s]  Nearly 11 p.m.
[1154.33s -> 1158.04s]  What do you only Q bandit where you from in that's that's a long?

[1177.64s -> 1179.64s]  14 days you got to wait for it
[1180.52s -> 1184.74s]  It's two weeks for processing
[1184.94s -> 1193.22s]  Actually, you know the the 720 streams on YouTube they do take quite a long time to process really
[1193.92s -> 1195.72s]  Melbourne, Australia

[1267.78s -> 1273.14s]  It was my least play class behind pyro. Now. It's one of my most played classes. Oh
[1274.33s -> 1281.78s]  God you need to die a lot to start realizing you're gonna dial on this
[1282.26s -> 1287.64s]  Stop dying. No, I think we've got a robot star here. I'm sorry
[1288.32s -> 1295.86s]  No, no, not anymore. Not anymore. Okay, I am getting random blanks like so maybe every once in a while. I'll be a robot
[1296.38s -> 1306.65s]  That's okay. We we forgive you. We all still love you. I think that's spy. No. Yeah, it is
[1306.65s -> 1312.74s]  Oh, yeah, it is. I could smell you getting off the elevator

[1396.82s -> 1398.82s]  You need two reserve slots
[1400.26s -> 1408.26s]  Please reply what server is it? It's my server
[1409.99s -> 1412.54s]  my server
[1412.54s -> 1418.59s]  German's East Coast sir. No put it down. I
[1419.27s -> 1423.67s]  Hate when that happens when I you go too far. He's like just miss with the mini century
[1424.27s -> 1426.27s]  That's too far man
[1426.31s -> 1431.75s]  You miss with the mini century. I don't know some some reason it happens though. Oh
[1432.72s -> 1437.24s]  God, this is the ghost again. You know what? I'm just gonna taunt because oh when you taunt
[1437.68s -> 1441.06s]  I'm just like dancing. Oh wait, that's because I have that I thought I had the
[1441.96s -> 1443.94s]  thought I had the
[1443.94s -> 1450.08s]  Gunslinger out, but I didn't where is he? I heard a spy
[1450.88s -> 1453.96s]  Now that was a dumb thing
[1453.96s -> 1463.51s]  Someone said doughnuts are amazing, especially crispy crispy creams. You've had a crispy cream doughnut. Um, I think so
[1463.67s -> 1466.19s]  No, maybe oh, they're so good
[1466.91s -> 1471.46s]  Crispy cream doughnuts are incredible. I don't know don't have names
[1472.10s -> 1475.07s]  Well, it's it's like it's like a company it's like kind of like a Dunkin Donuts
[1477.28s -> 1478.68s]  crispy creams
[1478.68s -> 1486.62s]  Pretty much a crispy cream doughnut is just a glazed doughnut and it literally melts inside of your mouth. It is just on it's unreal
[1487.26s -> 1490.91s]  You can't there's only like a few of them around around the Northeast though
[1491.63s -> 1494.53s]  unfortunate thing you've ever had
[1495.65s -> 1497.17s]  ice cream
[1497.17s -> 1501.69s]  Um ice cream. What it what's ice cream? Is that like something to do with like milk?
[1502.86s -> 1504.86s]  What am I doing? Why am I doing this?
[1505.26s -> 1512.02s]  Am I ever gonna put a ping limit on my server to be honest?
[1513.88s -> 1516.18s]  Probably 20
[1516.22s -> 1517.38s]  Probably not
[1517.38s -> 1521.06s]  The only reason why I say that is because I haven't had one in the last like
[1521.38s -> 1525.38s]  Two or three weeks since the service been online and hasn't really been any problems
[1525.54s -> 1531.78s]  So probably not and if there ever was one it would probably be something very very high something like ridiculously high like
[1532.10s -> 1533.70s]  480 or something
[1533.70s -> 1536.14s]  That's pretty low
[1536.78s -> 1539.14s]  I wish I had 480 thing. Oh
[1544.14s -> 1548.26s]  This heavy. Oh my god. I ran out of bullets. Oh, no. Oh
[1550.03s -> 1552.03s]  You're dead. Oh, why'd I do that?
[1552.59s -> 1559.50s]  Mr. Foreman Gary the Foreman Gary
[1562.94s -> 1565.96s]  Okay, I think this is guy's name
[1566.70s -> 1568.70s]  Okay, he told me uh, I
[1569.34s -> 1571.34s]  To say his name
[1571.62s -> 1573.86s]  And I just did it cuz I felt like
[1574.42s -> 1581.25s]  Don't worry. We'll get this thing built up baby. Let's do it baby. There was a ghost
[1581.81s -> 1588.86s]  I'll name him Gary. Oh what I didn't get it off in time. Oh, I'm so mad at myself
[1589.46s -> 1592.54s]  Let's go for a punch ready. Oh
[1592.86s -> 1594.86s]  Get over here you son of a
[1597.10s -> 1601.86s]  We're going punch only engineer right now, it's gonna work cuz every time I scream
[1602.30s -> 1607.50s]  I'm telling you dude every time I stream and I just go for melee only it for some reason it works
[1607.50s -> 1609.50s]  I don't know why I don't know. I
[1609.90s -> 1611.38s]  Wish I knew the answer
[1611.42s -> 1616.66s]  But for instance like oh my god, this guy just crits cringed me. No, I have no oh
[1626.98s -> 1628.98s]  It was a nice attempt with the
[1629.14s -> 1631.14s]  ng fist only crits cringed
[1631.46s -> 1634.47s]  It's super effective
[1634.59s -> 1638.88s]  That's her Pokemon. I
[1639.08s -> 1643.88s]  Hate this door glitch on harvest. I just want to leave. Are you stuck somewhere? Oh
[1649.08s -> 1652.65s]  Punch in the center. I'm gonna punch the crap out of it
[1653.17s -> 1660.43s]  All right, so I'm gonna ask you this first before I
[1661.43s -> 1664.23s]  Before I answer it, but do you like the Vikings?
[1666.43s -> 1667.95s]  Vikings huh?
[1667.95s -> 1670.10s]  like
[1670.10s -> 1676.86s]  Like real Vikings or are we talking about fictional Vikings right now? I don't know. That was the question
[1676.86s -> 1680.14s]  No, I actually I meant to hit J. I hate how J and K are right next to each other. I mean
[1680.70s -> 1682.70s]  Thor was okay
[1682.78s -> 1686.95s]  so
[1686.99s -> 1690.50s]  Yeah, Thor was okay, I I enjoy bike
[1691.58s -> 1697.06s]  But if you're having stream issues try to refresh the stream refresh the page
[1697.06s -> 1700.10s]  Oh, you're gonna say grabbing stream issues then Vikings aren't that good
[1702.98s -> 1712.72s]  Yeah, if you're especially if you're on 720 then a good refresh the stream will probably help you out probably
[1713.28s -> 1715.28s]  And Vikings are even worse
[1716.24s -> 1721.87s]  How does it look by the way for anyone watching how because this is only the second time I've ever streamed in 720
[1722.27s -> 1723.83s]  Is it we good?
[1723.83s -> 1725.83s]  We sound good. We look good. We smell good
[1726.35s -> 1728.35s]  And your internets fine with that?
[1729.17s -> 1731.73s]  Apparently it wasn't last night. That's for sure. I
[1734.39s -> 1736.71s]  Not tried to stream 720 a long time
[1737.51s -> 1739.83s]  My internet just seems that it doesn't enjoy
[1740.51s -> 1742.51s]  Yeah, I'd rather lay back
[1742.79s -> 1749.47s]  Hey, if if all goes well, then that's I mean last time I did 720 it seemed to work. Okay?
[1750.19s -> 1754.53s]  But last night I was trying to set it up because I usually stream on Saturday nights
[1754.93s -> 1758.65s]  And it was just like no I could I could barely stream in 360 last night
[1758.65s -> 1760.65s]  I was like testing it by myself on listed
[1761.33s -> 1764.33s]  Or private whatever and it was not happening
[1765.01s -> 1775.82s]  If you haven't stream problems, I feel bad for you, son. I got nine and a half problems motor stream ain't one. No
[1776.90s -> 1778.18s]  Joby
[1778.18s -> 1780.62s]  Joby, I love your quote
[1780.62s -> 1786.97s]  Hey, look at what I tell you just punching. Oh, you're not getting away
[1787.89s -> 1789.65s]  That was the shotgun
[1789.65s -> 1797.75s]  No, it wasn't knock. Okay. Yeah, that was a I punched my fist and it looked like a shotgun. Oh
[1800.46s -> 1802.02s]  my god
[1802.02s -> 1806.69s]  chaos
[1806.69s -> 1812.40s]  There's like a line of soldiers waiting to market garden me
[1813.90s -> 1823.82s]  I'll go. Don't wait you go. What class is star star?
[1825.34s -> 1827.51s]  Spies bond
[1828.83s -> 1830.83s]  What class is a
[1830.95s -> 1832.03s]  What
[1832.03s -> 1836.35s]  What class is star? He's a soldier. Sorry when that's by backstab me
[1836.35s -> 1838.79s]  I had like like an aneurysm or something. That was weird
[1839.51s -> 1841.51s]  Don't do that. It's not good for you
[1848.29s -> 1855.30s]  Many century fight. Well, we got two many centuries and we got a spa. I am almost there
[1856.00s -> 1858.12s]  No, I don't want kills on my market gardener
[1860.89s -> 1867.51s]  81 81 nice nice nice nice nice nice
[1868.15s -> 1873.58s]  Somebody asked am I gonna do another scary game facecam?
[1874.18s -> 1876.18s]  Yeah, dude that game was horrible
[1876.98s -> 1883.90s]  Horrible in the terms of I completely I'm with you. I'm good with scary like just watch me. Oh god, please
[1883.90s -> 1885.90s]  Why are you still going down?
[1886.26s -> 1888.26s]  We've agreed. This is a bad idea
[1889.14s -> 1894.50s]  It's you know what? It's because I started I'll give you guys I'll give you the backstory about that video
[1895.02s -> 1897.02s]  so I started recording and
[1897.02s -> 1900.50s]  I figured because I got a bunch of people asked me to do that
[1900.86s -> 1905.14s]  Somebody was like, oh do amnesia do SCP do this or that so I just was like, you know
[1905.14s -> 1905.62s]  I'm gonna do it
[1905.62s -> 1909.46s]  I feel like doing it and I got to a point where I was gonna turn it off
[1909.46s -> 1910.34s]  I was like, you know what?
[1910.34s -> 1914.22s]  I'm not gonna make this video like I'll just do something else like I'm not gonna make this video
[1914.78s -> 1920.10s]  Because I sat down with it and notice how the video started when I was like kind of down with two
[1924.11s -> 1928.51s]  Yeah, like I I just I pretty much get oh god, I'm lagging why oh
[1928.95s -> 1931.55s]  No, that's the order. That's the door glitch. I think you were talking about before
[1932.75s -> 1936.95s]  What's I the video starts and I'm like already down two floors
[1937.03s -> 1941.35s]  That's because I stopped recording and I just sit in there going. I don't I can't do this
[1941.35s -> 1947.75s]  I really I really didn't think I could do it and then halfway through when I was actually recording
[1948.27s -> 1953.37s]  You can you can see like in my face during the video. Oh my god over time over time. This is a pretty ridiculous fight
[1954.21s -> 1957.37s]  I'll get back to that story in a second. We lost no
[1957.81s -> 1959.01s]  Oh
[1959.01s -> 1963.45s]  Round ends as I'm midair. That's market going someone. That's all that matters
[1964.37s -> 1966.80s]  It's all matters
[1967.00s -> 1968.44s]  nothing else matters
[1968.44s -> 1976.06s]  But yes, I mean I I started to get to that point where I got the first spooked the first like big jumping scare
[1976.82s -> 1982.02s]  For a second. I was like, you know what? I'm about to hit I'm not I'm gonna hit escape f9 and I'm not doing it
[1982.58s -> 1985.62s]  But that's what I said, like, you know what? I can't give up like I have
[1986.02s -> 1989.30s]  I'm already like halfway done with like this thing. I might as well finish it
[1989.94s -> 1995.81s]  When that guy comes out that stuff, I'm not gonna ruin it really if you ever do
[1996.53s -> 1999.02s]  It's it is it is terrifying
[2001.14s -> 2002.94s]  Rage quits the game for you, too
[2002.94s -> 2006.50s]  That's why like at the end of the video I look like somebody hit me in the face with a wrench after that
[2006.50s -> 2010.74s]  I watched more videos of the game because like I wanted to figure out like how it ended or there was more
[2011.94s -> 2014.95s]  yeah, I freaked out because
[2015.98s -> 2017.34s]  seriously like
[2017.34s -> 2021.90s]  What you saw at the end of that video was like a 100% genuine like my face
[2021.90s -> 2027.30s]  I thought I didn't even know what was going on. I freaked out and then I was just like wait what happened?
[2027.30s -> 2037.58s]  Why am I did me? I was genuinely befuddled. Oh, that's not live stream it. Oh
[2039.37s -> 2041.37s]  Yeah, keep playing
[2047.58s -> 2052.72s]  Become known as the stair simulator guy the stairs the new stair simulator you're on it
[2053.86s -> 2060.55s]  Somebody was telling me to do a containment breach, and I looked up a couple things on it and my god that kid oh
[2061.47s -> 2063.23s]  my god
[2063.23s -> 2069.26s]  That it just looks it looks it looks ten times worse than scp. Oh eight seven the regular one
[2069.86s -> 2074.28s]  Wow nice shot
[2074.28s -> 2076.34s]  No, I'm gonna go
[2076.34s -> 2084.97s]  Bye like that one is like actually 3d make creatures and weird like stuff. We're not really 3d, but it's I
[2085.95s -> 2088.27s]  Was scared playing Quake 4 so
[2089.47s -> 2091.47s]  There's a game. You should not be scared playing
[2092.91s -> 2094.43s]  Quake 4
[2094.43s -> 2098.34s]  Yeah, there's this one room where there's like a giant beating heart in it
[2098.34s -> 2101.62s]  It's really dark and it took me like 20 minutes to get there
[2101.62s -> 2104.34s]  But all you have to do is walk up some stairs and like the missions over I
[2105.30s -> 2108.10s]  Was like just crouched walking the whole time like nope nope
[2109.22s -> 2112.52s]  doing this oh
[2112.52s -> 2116.92s]  We're gonna get up. I knew that was gonna happen. I knew that was gonna happen
[2117.50s -> 2125.78s]  What class do I play the most probably engineer you get actually we'll take a look you know
[2126.46s -> 2127.82s]  I do from here
[2127.82s -> 2132.98s]  Stats there you go. I've actually don't think I've ever shown this excited in a Q&A one time
[2132.98s -> 2135.30s]  But these are my team fortress 2 stats
[2135.86s -> 2140.56s]  And the reason why spy is so high this goes back in like 2007
[2141.08s -> 2143.08s]  Like that's all I played
[2143.44s -> 2147.84s]  Got a spy. I was looking at my set the other day, and I was disappointed with how much spy I played
[2148.68s -> 2153.24s]  Mm-hmm like 35 hours. When did I do that? When did I waste that much time?
[2153.24s -> 2156.12s]  Yeah, I have 138 hours to do that. That's nothing though
[2156.20s -> 2164.20s]  And also this is um I think my stats got reset at some point like very early on in the game
[2164.20s -> 2166.40s]  Oh, yeah, I reset mine a while. Yeah, oh
[2169.31s -> 2173.79s]  God there was one day where I was playing with bots and no one was playing with bots
[2173.79s -> 2177.03s]  I was like oh, I have to do this. I have to reset this
[2180.28s -> 2181.84s]  Bye
[2181.84s -> 2183.96s]  Spy on spy on spy
[2184.68s -> 2188.97s]  Whoa whoa no I didn't want to hit end
[2189.37s -> 2195.14s]  All right team, what do you say we do this come on? Let's go, baby
[2196.06s -> 2200.66s]  Did the dirt did it did the dirt? We're all hitting this together Jake
[2202.54s -> 2204.22s]  I'll play spy
[2204.22s -> 2205.91s]  spy
[2205.91s -> 2214.04s]  Spy I want to be the cool kind of person who plays spy. I want to be the coolest on this play
[2214.04s -> 2219.56s]  Oh come on. I was trying to did I actually get away with that like I did no I didn't oh
[2226.33s -> 2229.01s]  God, I just keep getting people like right when they have no health
[2229.49s -> 2238.13s]  That's how you do it. Oh, I knew I was gonna screw that up
[2238.81s -> 2244.85s]  Knew I was gonna screw that up. It's a bad attitude
[2245.57s -> 2255.30s]  No, I did a dead space to video well technically by I technically did grandpa has one on respawn
[2255.86s -> 2261.72s]  It's a hole in this straw, and I can't drink the rest of my iced tea
[2262.48s -> 2266.25s]  You're supposed to be a hole in it. That's how straws work. No
[2267.13s -> 2269.13s]  Aren't you so glad I'm here?
[2270.01s -> 2272.09s]  I am I it's
[2272.97s -> 2274.97s]  Hold on let me fix this
[2275.57s -> 2286.29s]  There we go. I did that. I did the best thing I flipped the straw upside down and put it back in genius
[2286.29s -> 2289.37s]  I know I am a genius already. I have no idea where we're going
[2289.37s -> 2292.45s]  I should have just changed the map to begin with but I was too busy like not paying attention
[2293.73s -> 2295.73s]  Hopefully, it's gold rush stars favorite map
[2296.41s -> 2299.42s]  like nowhere to jump I
[2300.22s -> 2302.39s]  Love gold rush so much
[2304.46s -> 2306.82s]  Actually, I did see one person who can do a jump on
[2307.82s -> 2313.06s]  Second point second map of gold rush from like start to finish all the way through with one jump
[2313.70s -> 2315.94s]  I'd probably just spend the entire round trying to do that
[2316.46s -> 2322.62s]  And if I did it our team would win just instantly. It's like getting a nuke
[2324.39s -> 2325.87s]  Getting a nuke
[2325.87s -> 2330.50s]  Somebody asked do I like yeah?
[2330.50s -> 2336.94s]  I'm using the diamond back because I like it and plus it's it's strange to so got to use it if it's strange I
[2337.54s -> 2340.61s]  Think that the diamond back has a bad rap
[2340.97s -> 2343.88s]  It's
[2343.88s -> 2345.88s]  Okay, I mean it's not it's
[2346.40s -> 2349.20s]  When you're fighting like 40 gunslinger and cheese. It's yeah
[2349.72s -> 2355.73s]  Well, let's put it this way right so the the ambassador and the diamond back had to do the same damage, right?
[2356.35s -> 2358.35s]  The ambassador shoots slower
[2358.91s -> 2362.03s]  The ambassador shoots 20% slower than the diamond back
[2362.67s -> 2364.47s]  But you get crits on the headshots
[2364.47s -> 2369.39s]  I mean you get crits on this if Doug you said if there are many centuries around I would say they're both good a
[2370.23s -> 2376.79s]  Lot of people really bash on the the diamond back well the best part about the diamond back is the sound oh yeah
[2377.19s -> 2380.51s]  So I mean technically it's it's like a better. It's a
[2381.67s -> 2387.59s]  Default if you're not going for headshots. It's better than the ambassador if you can't get headshots. It's better than the ambassador for sure
[2388.35s -> 2393.55s]  The ambassador is still though. It's it's so good. It's so good. Oh
[2400.40s -> 2402.56s]  Yeah playing that guitar. Oh
[2403.36s -> 2412.22s]  Are you why am I wearing that like Christmas item? I gotta put my ring on and somebody gave me
[2412.22s -> 2421.63s]  I have like the Christmas heart thing on you're just I don't know you're
[2422.27s -> 2423.23s]  hearty
[2423.23s -> 2430.80s]  I'm a cold so I could think of I totally forgot the frying pan
[2431.46s -> 2436.18s]  frying pan is
[2437.02s -> 2439.32s]  There's a mini century
[2439.64s -> 2444.81s]  I'm gonna take that out

[2706.20s -> 2708.76s]  What is that? I'm in a booth. I
[2710.08s -> 2712.08s]  Pulled up the dead ringer and I oh
[2713.99s -> 2719.43s]  that was I think I just had like a brain fought right there cuz I pulled the dead ring around when he lit me and
[2719.95s -> 2722.79s]  It worked and then it instantly why did I come out of it? Do you hear the noise?
[2722.79s -> 2724.79s]  It was like oh I came out of the dead ringer
[2725.03s -> 2726.95s]  But I didn't I was still in it
[2726.95s -> 2730.54s]  It is not Renaissance heroes
[2732.42s -> 2735.66s]  Is orb even online? I'm just gonna like ask him if I can like talk about it

[2752.91s -> 2757.84s]  Hey, I'm gonna go off spy. I'm too stupid right now to go to play anything else
[2759.48s -> 2767.03s]  Say hello to your Spaniard viewers. Hello everybody in Spain. Hope you guys are spending good in that Spaniard land
[2767.55s -> 2773.89s]  The cool part is I want to go to you three. That's like the main thing
[2774.25s -> 2778.61s]  Is it me? I could really care less about like winning the whole thing. How is you I?
[2779.21s -> 2782.95s]  Could care less about winning like the whole thing
[2782.95s -> 2788.75s]  but I do it would be awesome to go to e3 because then I could make videos and stuff about going to e3 and
[2789.39s -> 2794.77s]  It'd be so much fun. Well, that was a Wow
[2794.77s -> 2807.60s]  I am sorry to every single person here that just got covered in that Girardi. That was my fault. Well, I'm got quick fixed
[2808.18s -> 2812.10s]  What am I doing? I gotta get up here. What are you doing? Oh

[2822.46s -> 2828.49s]  Oh, I hear the Christmas bells
[2836.00s -> 2843.57s]  Need ammo, I probably will do more morning streams
[2843.57s -> 2847.39s]  We're not really morning streams, but early afternoon streams on Sunday
[2848.09s -> 2852.97s]  Just because I know that Saturday night can a lot of people can't watch it
[2853.69s -> 2855.69s]  And I am sorry about that
[2857.41s -> 2863.65s]  Oh
[2863.65s -> 2870.22s]  Every time I see somebody in the air. I always think it's you and I get scared
[2872.93s -> 2875.55s]  Every time every time somebody's
[2876.83s -> 2882.43s]  Oh, it's any time you're in a anyone's in the air I keep thinking it's you and it freaks me out
[2888.04s -> 2893.40s]  It's perfect
[2896.27s -> 2901.16s]  Spawn to spawn belly to belly the bum for jumbo
[2901.94s -> 2909.72s]  Spawn to spawn belly to belly. You know what that's from back to back belly to belly. I think it's from where
[2910.68s -> 2915.18s]  Where in the world is Carmen San Diego? I really think it is the game show the old game show
[2915.88s -> 2919.72s]  Somebody please look that up. Somebody find that out for me right now. I
[2921.16s -> 2923.72s]  Bet show is unwatchable. I wouldn't know
[2925.83s -> 2935.23s]  There he is there he is he's going for those garden kills no cool free
[2936.91s -> 2938.91s]  Hi stuff
[2938.91s -> 2940.79s]  Hey

[2947.87s -> 2952.39s]  It goes from our garden. Oh my god. I thought it was I thought it was you I was like, oh my god
[2952.39s -> 2954.39s]  Oh, no, if it was me, I would have got you
[2955.35s -> 2961.59s]  Her her and star star sounds a bit robotic. He said he's his internet's going up and down. So sorry
[2962.55s -> 2965.77s]  Not anymore though. You sound fine now. Okay, good
[2966.53s -> 2971.88s]  Now have I killed one person this like entire time, how do I have 18 points?
[2972.52s -> 2979.32s]  What what did I do? Did I kill anybody? I guess so. I don't even like remember killing anyone. I
[2980.40s -> 2987.68s]  Did a jump I did Joe my mommy was proud
[2988.36s -> 2997.08s]  Well, I got up my cat is like scratching the door. I probably have
[2997.64s -> 3000.96s]  One of if not the most annoying cats in the world
[3001.60s -> 3009.09s]  See he knows my window when it's open, he knows he can come over and annoy me by just going like
[3012.25s -> 3015.33s]  Until I come let him in and if I don't let him in he will sit there
[3016.05s -> 3020.33s]  He probably wouldn't even eat or sleep until I let him in like through like the window
[3022.13s -> 3027.41s]  Yeah, you kidding and it's like, you know, there's another way you can go right that you can't get in my window
[3027.81s -> 3029.81s]  He just knows I'll let him in
[3029.85s -> 3032.70s]  Always leave it open
[3032.70s -> 3034.70s]  Hmm. So what time is right now?
[3036.02s -> 3043.01s]  That's the real question. I don't know probably another round or two on
[3044.17s -> 3047.65s]  TF and I think I'm gonna transition to some Diablo free
[3048.82s -> 3056.09s]  Diablo some Diablo cuz I gotta get my witch doctor up in
[3057.25s -> 3059.25s]  You know, I think we're still the same
[3059.57s -> 3069.62s]  45 I did level up a bit. Hold on a second. Are there there's not random crits on right now, is there? No
[3070.18s -> 3077.76s]  Was that it cuz that guy that guy was uber charged. He wasn't crits create. That was weird. I got killed by a crit
[3077.76s -> 3082.96s]  Yeah, you know, no, no, no, no, you know, it probably was like a fuck banner. That peepee probably was the peepee banner
[3083.68s -> 3086.58s]  Keep banner that I'm gonna get headshot. Oh
[3087.14s -> 3091.98s]  My god, you both just like came in at the same time and I missed
[3092.70s -> 3098.65s]  Let's go. Yeah
[3099.05s -> 3101.29s]  Let's go
[3101.29s -> 3108.28s]  No, no, no, no with that thing what Tommy's left? Yeah. How do you aim?
[3109.26s -> 3116.85s]  I love the Thomas love. It's my favorite. It's too hard
[3117.49s -> 3125.02s]  Aiming is hard. Yeah star does make rocket jumping look so much fun
[3125.02s -> 3128.06s]  He also makes it look really easy too, and it is absolutely not
[3129.38s -> 3139.90s]  One of the best videos I've ever seen of Team Fortress 2 is that video where you jumped to do
[3140.82s -> 3146.88s]  Where you jumped across like the whole thing a high tower and man-treaded some pyro it was unbelievable
[3146.88s -> 3150.00s]  I wasn't even that good. Oh, it was the don't even know
[3150.82s -> 3153.30s]  When I finally put all these park gardener kills together
[3153.82s -> 3160.42s]  Well, when you finally put this bark garden thing together, I I it's probably gonna get like 700 million views. It's gonna be that good
[3161.22s -> 3171.28s]  The bomb is mirroring a checkpoint. All right. Oh
[3172.62s -> 3174.62s]  Man, hey you did
[3175.14s -> 3180.58s]  Somebody wrote I can't believe I'm watching a YouTube stream. That's working
[3181.16s -> 3182.48s]  Yeah
[3182.48s -> 3189.68s]  There yeah, YouTube streams are well, they're in beta. So there is always gonna be a lot of problems
[3190.12s -> 3198.11s]  But you know, whatever it's all good. And who's the other guy that is star? I'm a guy
[3198.55s -> 3203.20s]  That is STA our star. Thank you for spelling it
[3203.92s -> 3208.00s]  I
[3215.76s -> 3222.16s]  Somebody write stars channel in the in the in the comment section just so the people that don't know will know
[3222.60s -> 3229.08s]  It's youtube.com slash niched
[3230.27s -> 3231.27s]  ni
[3231.27s -> 3233.39s]  I see HTS, right? Yes
[3236.03s -> 3237.79s]  Usually I'm pretty bad
[3237.79s -> 3244.18s]  So I know you're gonna win this tournament because I'm guaranteeing it's a spelling bee. That's why I don't want to talk about it. Oh
[3244.18s -> 3247.61s]  My god get out of it
[3248.69s -> 3252.16s]  Just on your head. Oh, it's so scary. I
[3252.76s -> 3259.56s]  Like don't know like what to do it. There's like spies this rocket garden ring stars and
[3260.08s -> 3266.57s]  This other guy that's like another star. It's doing it. I'm like a heavy. I don't have any points
[3267.49s -> 3269.49s]  Just saw that guy get smoked. Oh
[3269.65s -> 3274.20s]  Here's a pro like a pro tip pro tip as heavy on car
[3274.20s -> 3278.68s]  If you're being a cart heavy do it do the crouch dance. You got to go like do do do do do
[3279.60s -> 3283.68s]  Do you do you do you gotta like crouch grouch grout grout?
[3283.68s -> 3287.40s]  You gotta be gonna win because I I think I've convinced my team not to try it all off
[3287.40s -> 3289.40s]  You see like the pyro walking out there
[3290.12s -> 3292.12s]  We're taking it easy
[3297.47s -> 3310.68s]  Cart heavy is fun. Yeah, okay. It is cart heavy spot how to jump is cart heavy
[3311.82s -> 3314.18s]  You got to get the new rocket launcher for the heavy. Yeah
[3314.82s -> 3316.82s]  the best you could do is like
[3317.18s -> 3319.18s]  Yeah gloves of running urgently jumps
[3319.66s -> 3322.78s]  Here we go ready. That's I'll show you how to rocket jump as a heavy
[3323.86s -> 3325.86s]  See look at how far I just went. Oh
[3330.48s -> 3334.48s]  No, I'm almost out of my lodge
[3334.96s -> 3338.16s]  Dunkin Donuts fresh-brewed iced tea. That's not a good thing
[3338.68s -> 3344.93s]  Get another I have to drive to Dunkin Donuts. I wish I'd said the Dunkin Donuts in my house. Yes
[3345.73s -> 3351.20s]  Get a Dunkin Donuts just buy a franchise just own it just so you can live in it. I
[3351.80s -> 3355.45s]  Would I would if that there if I had a house
[3356.17s -> 3361.99s]  Think I'm not even really a big coffee drinker as I'd love iced tea and their iced tea is really really really good. Oh
[3363.32s -> 3365.32s]  Dear God chaos
[3365.84s -> 3382.16s]  Maybe I should shoot some things. I think I'm gonna shoot some things. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I got I got a ghost recon
[3382.36s -> 3384.20s]  They gave me hats
[3384.20s -> 3390.76s]  Ghost recon. Yes. So now the classes I'm allowed to play insist of rocket jumping soldier or one of the classes that got a hat
[3394.09s -> 3399.53s]  Is that game any good he played it's not out yet. It's out in like a week. Oh, it's looking really good
[3399.97s -> 3401.97s]  Yeah, I heard it's supposed to be pretty
[3402.37s -> 3406.33s]  Your hints they're going a different like direction, aren't they? Whoa
[3407.37s -> 3411.61s]  It's kind of funny that a ghost recon is I love the first one
[3412.05s -> 3417.93s]  Mm-hmm, and they have dumbed down the series a lot since then and usually that would like piss me off to no end
[3418.05s -> 3421.05s]  But for some reason this time I'm glad ghost recon is dumber
[3421.93s -> 3428.12s]  Because what was the one game? I'm happy about that. It's dumber. It wasn't wasn't the ghost recon series very very strategic
[3428.48s -> 3432.68s]  Like I had a very stuff or planning groups and this one
[3432.68s -> 3436.72s]  I mean it has all of that but for the most part, you know, it's not gonna happen, right, right
[3437.64s -> 3439.94s]  It's kind of like TF2
[3442.30s -> 3450.05s]  Hmm. So when I watch like trailers over those things reminds me of Gears of War a little bit like that kind of it's like third person
[3450.05s -> 3451.97s]  Yeah, it's not that third person vibe to it
[3452.01s -> 3455.33s]  It's definitely it has like all the wall hugging mechanics that gears would have
[3456.69s -> 3460.87s]  But I don't know. I actually wanted this game since they first started showing single-player trailers of it
[3461.57s -> 3466.04s]  But multiplayer looks pretty fun. I love fun things
[3466.56s -> 3469.06s]  Yeah, definitely
[3469.06s -> 3472.72s]  Fun stuff. I throw to peepee
[3475.48s -> 3484.69s]  Alright, we'll do I cannot get on that car. What am I doing? Why did I just pull that out? I'm gonna die
[3485.61s -> 3491.25s]  Why what about what do I have this awful not fists of steel? I need to put
[3492.07s -> 3497.38s]  Dermot you keep running in a circle. I know
[3499.06s -> 3501.06s]  That's what happens when I live stream
[3503.16s -> 3508.18s]  My two centers of my brain fight for dominance and like I then I just like walk about in circle what happened
[3508.76s -> 3512.21s]  Now we get a wrangled
[3512.77s -> 3514.77s]  Century that is yikes
[3515.13s -> 3518.65s]  Like that's a spy. Oh
[3518.69s -> 3520.19s]  I
[3520.19s -> 3522.75s]  Missed my melee swing because I was in his body
[3523.67s -> 3528.68s]  Where's this other guy? Wait sandwich take it eat it. Yeah
[3529.16s -> 3535.31s]  Come this way. Come this way. I'm gonna go up. We're gonna go up top and
[3538.40s -> 3540.24s]  Oh
[3540.24s -> 3544.98s]  Get on the car
[3546.06s -> 3549.66s]  And come on somebody touch it. Oh, I should have stayed behind it
[3550.26s -> 3555.28s]  Yeah, but you didn't you know, I'm stupid
[3556.08s -> 3562.54s]  It's a one more round after this and then we'll move on to some do I have below three? Okay
[3563.36s -> 3571.04s]  Take that
[3571.52s -> 3581.96s]  I should have ready. That's it. No, it's not. Oh my I should have given a sandwich my poor medic friend
[3583.60s -> 3585.60s]  No
[3591.07s -> 3594.03s]  That was essentially a warning new rank
[3597.35s -> 3603.44s]  I'm sufficient kind of lethal. It's good. Oh
[3605.03s -> 3609.96s]  God spy a
[3610.12s -> 3612.47s]  spa
[3612.47s -> 3614.47s]  yes, this will be on YouTube in
[3615.35s -> 3620.43s]  When I finish the stream, it'll probably be up there after maybe an hour to a processing. So
[3621.17s -> 3623.81s]  We assume what time is it right now?
[3623.81s -> 3628.97s]  It is nine thirty a.m. For me probably stream for another couple hours or so at least another hour
[3629.69s -> 3631.09s]  and
[3631.09s -> 3634.20s]  It should be up by maybe noon ish. Maybe
[3637.40s -> 3642.68s]  That's what it says about I talked to some people and they said that apparently that's not true. That's not the case
[3643.40s -> 3645.28s]  Yeah, I guess there's a lie to you
[3645.28s -> 3650.12s]  It's like oh you can't you can't upload a automatic stream longer than two hours and then people do it
[3650.12s -> 3655.32s]  So I don't know. I guess they would want to discourage everyone. I don't know. Yeah, it's weird
[3656.16s -> 3659.48s]  It's very weird
[3659.48s -> 3665.17s]  Someone said since when is her blur go a warning her blur
[3666.09s -> 3671.62s]  It is yeah, I could be seen as a warning. Well, what else do you think I'm gonna do if I'm screaming that?
[3672.96s -> 3679.00s]  I'm either on the toilet or about to kill you. Oh man. They have too many things going on in there. Watch out buddy
[3679.76s -> 3688.14s]  Yeah, you take the sandwich. You need it you eat sandwich. I'm we gotta go. I gotta go around
[3688.62s -> 3695.69s]  It's all about is it they only have a mini century man
[3695.69s -> 3701.09s]  We're getting pushed back by a mini century and like a bunch of devil man. Oh god. I'm so dead. Oh god
[3701.93s -> 3706.99s]  Why do I not have these out somebody asked? All right, here we go. Here we go
[3707.63s -> 3721.52s]  There we go. Come on. Come on. Somebody help me. I shot you with my gun
[3721.72s -> 3729.07s]  It was a bomb gun a bomb gun. Is that new? Yeah, I hope I get it
[3731.91s -> 3734.93s]  I am really believe all don't know
[3735.59s -> 3739.79s]  I'm probably not gonna switch servers for some of you guys asking only because stars in here and
[3740.19s -> 3744.51s]  I wouldn't want it to be like oh, we both can't get into the same server and plus I'm on my server
[3744.51s -> 3749.36s]  So I like playing on my server because I like playing with the dudes on my server because they're cool
[3750.24s -> 3755.96s]  So one more we say let's go to
[3757.08s -> 3763.62s]  No, no, no, no, no, let's go to good old gold rush. Oh, please. No
[3764.46s -> 3767.47s]  All right, fine. We find out
[3767.95s -> 3775.61s]  Well, I'm trying to like figure out how to like do something fun. Ah
[3777.21s -> 3783.51s]  No, I slapped you I got you. You need to rapid-fire that. Oh you can do that
[3783.65s -> 3787.85s]  Yeah, if you just keep mashing the button you can get slapped so much it like pops you up in the air
[3788.57s -> 3795.94s]  You there. All right, let's go. Oh, you're gonna be mad, but I kind of want to play on Turbine
[3798.22s -> 3803.42s]  No, it's not as long as I don't know. I just want to jump in turbine. I
[3804.02s -> 3807.15s]  guess
[3807.15s -> 3809.52s]  Turbine has stairs. I
[3809.76s -> 3816.12s]  Just love Turbine. I love a lot of things. Don't I should have played two for two for it?
[3816.48s -> 3821.73s]  But turbines like the good two for it, isn't it? No two for it is the best two for it
[3827.20s -> 3841.71s]  No, a two for it is the best two for it. I'll stick with demo night. Oh, it's my spray. Ah
[3842.43s -> 3845.15s]  German oh
[3845.15s -> 3854.07s]  Everyone now hates you Gary monster. Look what you did what I do what I do what happened what I do
[3854.59s -> 3856.99s]  You picked this map. So
[3857.63s -> 3861.40s]  There's a ceiling on this map
[3861.72s -> 3867.60s]  There's nowhere that does not have a ceiling. Yeah, but you could do like an off-the-wall kind of like move. Okay?
[3868.28s -> 3871.51s]  Yeah
[3871.51s -> 3880.00s]  Yeah, I don't know I'll ask him star you're gonna play Diablo 3 as well. Yeah sure. Yeah, sure
[3880.64s -> 3881.98s]  Yeah, sure
[3881.98s -> 3883.30s]  T Milan
[3883.30s -> 3886.48s]  Okay. Oh, I hear a dog. I think that might be my dog
[3887.26s -> 3898.55s]  My dog. Oh my god a sentry
[3899.71s -> 3902.59s]  Strategy to turbine hold mid win game. Oh
[3904.31s -> 3911.67s]  How are you still here to overheal makes sense? Oh, okay. Damn it. I I
[3912.91s -> 3916.13s]  Was trying I was gonna go for a top kill and I'm gonna walk into corner
[3919.05s -> 3923.82s]  Why is this response so long I changed that
[3924.30s -> 3929.80s]  It's respawner way. It's respawn time right change the respawn on turbine. You can't
[3930.48s -> 3932.97s]  It's to turbine. Come on
[3933.57s -> 3940.07s]  You could change the respawn easy cat. I don't know. I have my respawn wave time at 2
[3940.67s -> 3942.99s]  And that's supposed to be god crits
[3943.55s -> 3949.64s]  I thought I was gonna bite my ankles in a second. He's probably gonna run here
[3955.62s -> 3965.94s]  Oh, come on, I want my crits. Oh my crits let grandpa play Diablo. I don't think he would get it
[3965.94s -> 3967.94s]  I think he'd be too confused
[3968.66s -> 3972.36s]  Because there's too many numbers to deal with in Diablo. You don't just like shoot people
[3972.36s -> 3976.68s]  Well, that's why they made numbers off by default and no advanced tooltips
[3977.48s -> 3980.18s]  People like him what just happened?
[3980.70s -> 3986.71s]  All right, so I charged with the charge and charge and right when I clicked right click
[3986.71s -> 3991.31s]  I got backstabbed and my body just like baseball slid across like the whole map. I
[3991.83s -> 3996.57s]  Love getting backstabbed or right as you rocket jump and your body just poof
[4004.05s -> 4012.80s]  Okay, what do you say let me find some dude to run into here there's a mini sentry
[4014.45s -> 4018.12s]  Mmm help me. I'm real I swear
[4018.92s -> 4022.82s]  That's a sticky
[4023.29s -> 4026.61s]  Mm-hmm. That's me getting shot hide right here. Shh. I know a secret
[4029.58s -> 4039.46s]  And then you just what what I I was gonna work on my secret technique and 20 seconds. Hold on a minute. Oh
[4041.35s -> 4044.07s]  Actually, I was about to type in the server password
[4044.59s -> 4049.19s]  Like hold on. Let me just like type my Archon password right now in front of like 400 people
[4049.75s -> 4051.75s]  Okay, that would be a bad idea
[4052.23s -> 4059.63s]  20 that's too long 20 seconds. It's supposed to be like 9
[4060.43s -> 4069.78s]  Come here. There's turbine. Oh
[4069.94s -> 4071.94s]  Why how did knock back?
[4072.10s -> 4079.60s]  Get over here. It is morning. It is 9 just about 10 a.m. Here in the East Coast
[4080.22s -> 4092.90s]  United States. Oh, I've got I thought it. Oh, yeah, we had like 2% health left 10% 20, whatever
[4100.10s -> 4104.40s]  I killed a guy. This is why we can't have nice things
[4105.08s -> 4110.34s]  Please German just please one two for it. I
[4111.70s -> 4114.58s]  Think two Ford is is maybe I took it out of the rotation
[4115.34s -> 4119.86s]  Alright, how about this before I leave? I will switch the map to two for it. How does that sound?
[4120.50s -> 4123.82s]  That does not sound good. Yeah, but this guy does. Oh
[4127.45s -> 4129.45s]  Okay, I did not know that was coming
[4129.65s -> 4132.59s]  Yeah, he was too busy hitting me
[4132.63s -> 4140.13s]  Remember if you crouch and just stand still when you're in a melee fight one-on-one
[4140.77s -> 4148.08s]  Probably gonna win because people freak out too much they run around they go. What is this and hey open that door? Whoa?
[4148.64s -> 4151.74s]  I'm going to get the intelligence. You know what screw this. Oh
[4153.20s -> 4155.48s]  Never mind. He already got it. Good job scout
[4156.00s -> 4158.92s]  Good job, dude
[4158.92s -> 4163.31s]  You type 25 comments and haven't gotten a cheeseburger yet
[4163.31s -> 4169.59s]  So I think there's a YouTube bug you should have already gotten at least three cheeseburgers dispensed from your laptop reading or just
[4169.95s -> 4172.75s]  Chat the stream. How do you do that?
[4175.47s -> 4176.59s]  It's an uh
[4176.59s -> 4182.39s]  It's just you make it. Oh, I'm sorry. I can't speak too much stuff going on
[4184.43s -> 4186.43s]  You uh, you just do
[4186.63s -> 4189.83s]  Update comments automatically and they'll come in as they come in. I
[4191.34s -> 4195.16s]  Think there's still like a minute or so behind though. That's the thing with YouTube
[4195.82s -> 4197.82s]  This isn't even pro turbine
[4197.94s -> 4199.86s]  There's no banana
[4199.86s -> 4201.58s]  pro turbine
[4201.58s -> 4205.32s]  Yeah, I'm pro turbine. There's a banana
[4205.96s -> 4208.20s]  Is it really?
[4208.32s -> 4212.85s]  Well, they call it banana, but it's like a different path on the side. It's shaped like a banana
[4213.53s -> 4218.18s]  Yeah, you should you should get a double cheeseburger should come out of your
[4218.82s -> 4221.82s]  out of your CD tray
[4221.82s -> 4228.83s]  Every 25 comments that you make on the stream a double cheeseburger from your favorite
[4229.29s -> 4234.37s]  Restaurant comes out of your CD tray. I don't have a CD tray. That's probably why it's not working
[4234.37s -> 4238.57s]  Yeah, if you don't have a CD tray or a zip drive to you have to have like a zip drive. Oh
[4240.64s -> 4242.60s]  God
[4242.60s -> 4246.20s]  Why am I still equipped? Why is it still out? Why do I still have this out? What am I doing?
[4246.80s -> 4251.08s]  Can't believe I got away with that. Oh my god. I can't believe we got away with that either. Oh
[4256.26s -> 4261.00s]  That was a brigade oh
[4261.20s -> 4263.20s]  I'm at the end of my drink. You know what that means
[4263.68s -> 4271.40s]  It's time to this thing is like floating. What the hell your cheeseburger had blue cheese
[4272.02s -> 4273.82s]  Sounds pretty dang good
[4273.82s -> 4281.98s]  All right star you ready I got a question for you. Oh god, what is
[4284.10s -> 4286.10s]  One more round we'll do one more
[4286.54s -> 4288.54s]  Please please
[4289.02s -> 4297.26s]  All right, fine. We'll switch. All right. We'll go to start a star. What map do you want to play them jump tricks?
[4298.97s -> 4302.41s]  You want to play the jump map? I don't even think I have it installed
[4304.78s -> 4315.54s]  All right, it needs to be like in like the team fortress database thinking like frontier
[4316.69s -> 4318.69s]  Frontier and
[4319.45s -> 4320.73s]  Here we go
[4320.73s -> 4327.24s]  Your cheeseburger had a green bun. Well, that's definitely if you're gonna ask me a thing
[4328.40s -> 4330.40s]  Oh, yeah, I forgot the thing. I was gonna ask you
[4332.60s -> 4340.62s]  Probably was really really important. Yeah one round of frontier and that'll end the team fortress for the day
[4341.14s -> 4343.14s]  Then it will bond Diablo 3 for a little while
[4343.14s -> 4352.46s]  I was trying to think of good stock payload maps that aren't upward and my mind just blanked and I said frontier
[4354.06s -> 4364.04s]  All right, what do you mean red or red or blue better? Let's go. Let's go blue go blue
[4364.40s -> 4366.20s]  I'm gonna play medic
[4366.20s -> 4372.24s]  Because I kind of feel like it. I like this setup. I'm gonna stick with it
[4372.76s -> 4379.85s]  Except I don't want the crits create a gadget. I want the default Medigun. There we go
[4380.25s -> 4385.82s]  You gotta keep control of your TVs. You have snipers hump in the door
[4388.66s -> 4391.19s]  Spray
[4391.19s -> 4398.74s]  mission begins in
[4398.98s -> 4402.90s]  500 seconds that would be nice
[4403.50s -> 4407.90s]  There's a sign out here that says speed limit 15
[4408.76s -> 4410.76s]  speed limit 15
[4416.71s -> 4421.70s]  Five
[4424.50s -> 4430.66s]  Thirty so have you guys been able to hear the in-game audio like the explosions and stuff
[4431.34s -> 4436.18s]  Or is that been too low? I'm always so afraid to turn that up because I feel like it's gonna overpower everything I said
[4441.34s -> 4446.76s]  I think I'm gonna get crits, which is perfect because then how could I possibly miss a market card?
[4447.90s -> 4457.05s]  All right, who am I gonna give this to? I don't even know we'll go with the
[4457.73s -> 4466.44s]  You know, he's already doing one. Let's go this way. Oh my god. Oh god. Oh god
[4467.16s -> 4469.82s]  Wow
[4469.82s -> 4472.78s]  Come here. Come here. Oh
[4472.78s -> 4475.75s]  God work
[4475.75s -> 4477.27s]  We're good. We're good
[4477.27s -> 4484.95s]  You're good. I'm not. Oh, no, I was bro. I was my hand my right click
[4484.95s -> 4489.07s]  Did you drop uber my right click was clicking on the uber?
[4489.07s -> 4491.07s]  It was like and I got backstab
[4493.22s -> 4508.54s]  I've got oh, no, that's you. I can't believe that no work
[4508.54s -> 4513.94s]  I don't even know if it was you because there was like three medics
[4514.42s -> 4518.75s]  Maybe two I can't count. Give me that uber. Give me that over
[4524.13s -> 4530.42s]  All right, I'm not gonna look now I better watch out I'm doing it right
[4531.54s -> 4535.87s]  come on heavy and
[4536.27s -> 4539.79s]  Team uber I'm hiding everyone is safe now
[4543.78s -> 4545.02s]  Yeah
[4545.02s -> 4551.80s]  Come on. Give me another uber. Oh god two spies. That's not gonna work
[4553.40s -> 4555.40s]  I'm in of my head right now
[4555.44s -> 4560.82s]  spies a spy a spy
[4561.58s -> 4565.22s]  Help me
[4565.22s -> 4573.80s]  No, stay alive this guy. Oh my god. You were about to die. Oh
[4576.06s -> 4578.62s]  I'd use it. I didn't want that was really early
[4579.26s -> 4583.81s]  I'm ashamed to say I know you this guy. Oh, yeah. Well, look what we just did
[4584.65s -> 4586.45s]  We just came like that
[4586.45s -> 4588.41s]  We did a good job
[4588.41s -> 4593.11s]  Well, I saw this guy only had like 1% health and if I didn't use it
[4593.11s -> 4595.23s]  He would have died and it was only me and a sniper behind him. So
[4595.95s -> 4600.39s]  When will the next grandpa video be uploaded? It was uploaded last night
[4601.23s -> 4604.23s]  Machinima respawn. It's on the featured video list. Go check it out
[4608.34s -> 4612.50s]  Actually to be honest, I'm sorry. I didn't even I didn't even let anybody know that was there
[4612.66s -> 4615.14s]  I'll do that today after this is over. Oh
[4621.79s -> 4627.67s]  This is bad the tension
[4630.23s -> 4635.45s]  I guess I do have two kills. No, come here mark. Let me hear you. Oh
[4639.58s -> 4641.46s]  backed up into a knife
[4641.46s -> 4648.12s]  somebody wants me to say a
[4648.36s -> 4656.49s]  Dirty word hidden do it. It's hidden in like a regular sentence. I know that I know that trick
[4656.65s -> 4658.49s]  That's a dirty trick
[4658.49s -> 4666.50s]  If your chat is frozen try and re refresh the page
[4667.50s -> 4669.30s]  reexec
[4669.30s -> 4671.30s]  Really? What do you say? Really? What?
[4671.93s -> 4674.87s]  reexec the config
[4675.27s -> 4682.10s]  I need help. I need you to heal me, please. Oh
[4686.54s -> 4688.54s]  This thing is so good. I love this thing
[4689.06s -> 4693.44s]  Doesn't seem like much what the overdose doesn't seem like much but it is
[4694.12s -> 4704.13s]  It really helps in situations a lot of situations at all. It's not that much it is though, but you need
[4704.73s -> 4706.60s]  boot solider
[4706.60s -> 4710.52s]  Yeah, but then you start to take damage like you you don't get the full plus three. Yeah
[4710.52s -> 4712.52s]  Well, you just have to make sure you hit every needle
[4713.08s -> 4716.00s]  But that's too hard and you are gonna land right on my face
[4716.52s -> 4719.24s]  Now if you're gonna back up like a punk not gonna
[4720.16s -> 4722.38s]  Like what you don't want to die
[4722.38s -> 4733.97s]  See look, I'm running fast. I'm gonna back up like a punk. All right. I'm going for a team over right there
[4733.97s -> 4737.85s]  We're looking at we gotta push up. It's not it's not gonna be a single man effort right now. Oh
[4739.22s -> 4742.50s]  No, oh did I just totally block you from that? I
[4744.46s -> 4751.19s]  Actually apologize if I did I probably missed anyway, I'm missing like every swing
[4751.87s -> 4753.87s]  giving you per sauce
[4755.47s -> 4763.37s]  No, I don't want him to die that's a spy that's a spy that's a spy it definitely is no it's not
[4763.89s -> 4781.44s]  You know this thing be careful. I thought that was I know not that anything but the little full caver
[4783.94s -> 4788.13s]  Anything with the evil caper miss out. Come here. Don't run away. Oh
[4793.61s -> 4795.61s]  Everybody needs help and there's nothing like oh
[4796.53s -> 4803.70s]  Don't die. There's a guy behind you. I'll push that up
[4805.13s -> 4806.49s]  Oh, yeah
[4806.49s -> 4812.25s]  Get on this. How is this mini century? Oh, I'm dead. Goodbye. Goodbye cruel world
[4812.73s -> 4819.73s]  You got chicken out of the tray. That's that's not supposed to happen
[4820.29s -> 4826.60s]  There's only supposed to be cheeseburgers meat and cheese the ketchup onion mustard
[4827.24s -> 4837.55s]  Relish why am I going this way? I always do that on upward. I always go the wrong way upward support the little guy
[4837.95s -> 4840.96s]  hashtag that's my
[4841.32s -> 4843.66s]  philosophy and
[4843.66s -> 4847.91s]  Apparently grandpa you sentry set up and you guys have a lot of stuff over there
[4848.03s -> 4851.78s]  You don't even know yet because it's set up like four miles away
[4852.26s -> 4862.98s]  You need a time to prepare and put it in a really really lame century spot. So name for that lame
[4863.72s -> 4865.51s]  name
[4865.51s -> 4867.51s]  Everything's name. I
[4867.55s -> 4889.20s]  Backed up into another knife backed up back it up. That's the way
[4892.24s -> 4894.80s]  You are up top there and I'm gonna die
[4895.80s -> 4899.44s]  Man, these spies are really making me paranoid
[4900.16s -> 4904.22s]  There's like forty hundred of them. I mean to
[4904.90s -> 4909.64s]  This one back here somewhere. Oh, there is
[4910.52s -> 4917.39s]  Well, I was gonna heal that guy too. My god. I
[4919.89s -> 4925.05s]  Am NOT turning my back. I'm gonna face this way the whole time. See I knew it get out of that
[4925.05s -> 4927.69s]  Oh overdose you are my friend
[4928.41s -> 4930.21s]  It's all in your mind
[4930.21s -> 4934.03s]  Yeah, but even if it is on my mind, it's still still makes me get that extra mile
[4934.61s -> 4937.73s]  In your mind. Oh
[4939.91s -> 4945.79s]  My god, I can't heal y'all Ryan. All right, let's push this thing
[4951.49s -> 4964.37s]  Somebody get up there. Somebody get up there. There we go. There we go. There we go
[4965.01s -> 4967.01s]  push little wagon
[4971.54s -> 4976.07s]  Prepared for lame century. Are you mentally ready for this?
[4978.49s -> 4980.49s]  Is there like a bunch of there?
[4980.97s -> 4984.37s]  That's all right. It's all right spy. I got you. I got you
[4985.69s -> 4988.05s]  I'll make sure you have a nice thick overheal
[4988.57s -> 4993.17s]  By the time you get out of here and by the time I'm not afraid to leave which is right now
[4993.69s -> 5001.37s]  There's a lot of people there. Oh
[5005.81s -> 5013.55s]  No, no, no, heal me. Heal me, please. Oh damn it bomb gun. Ah
[5015.42s -> 5030.60s]  That was pretty nice run though. I I'm proud of that little run proud people say you should try to pan me
[5032.03s -> 5038.85s]  I am missing every single market garden. Oh, that was a glitch
[5040.13s -> 5055.77s]  That's why that's not why it looks like he's running slower. That was weird. We got you
[5055.77s -> 5061.36s]  I gotta get up move up move up. No, come here
[5062.16s -> 5066.42s]  That gear up. Oh, is our century gun?
[5067.10s -> 5077.03s]  Damn leave it is we got three medics to we should be pushing this car like crazy. You need 14 heavies
[5077.63s -> 5082.11s]  We only have one and there was there's a spy right there that pyro. I'm waiting for him to come over here
[5082.73s -> 5085.17s]  My yeah, here's no head either. Where's this head?
[5085.77s -> 5089.45s]  Where's this guy's head? Yeah, I've been noticing that a lot lately. Is that just on spies?
[5090.13s -> 5094.93s]  Yeah, if a spy disguises as a pyro when they're wearing a certain hat, it can't display the hat. Oh
[5095.57s -> 5099.57s]  Or something like that. Oh god. I that guy just ubered at the same time as me
[5100.61s -> 5104.29s]  We just both over the same guy at the same time
[5104.93s -> 5110.82s]  Yeah, I'm going I'm going for it. I'm going for some not so stuff right here
[5111.44s -> 5113.86s]  What I'm sniper because we had none. No, we have three
[5114.54s -> 5121.24s]  Now this is a higher number that guy only needed one hit and I didn't get it
[5121.76s -> 5130.34s]  What movies were films my planet on scene?
[5131.85s -> 5136.60s]  Probably I still haven't seen the Avengers. I have to see the Avengers
[5137.12s -> 5140.93s]  Have you seen that star? Yep. Is it was it good?
[5143.25s -> 5146.43s]  Yes, I know it's good because there's explosions
[5146.87s -> 5151.27s]  But I had like a two hour long conversation with someone about why it's terrible really
[5152.07s -> 5157.48s]  Just nothing makes sense if you watch it you need to question everything that happens and say why is this happening?
[5158.00s -> 5160.12s]  And you will realize you don't know
[5161.00s -> 5168.48s]  Nobody knows the Avengers. I don't really watch a whole lot of movies to be honest
[5169.53s -> 5174.18s]  Dark night. Yeah, that's definitely one. I mean yeah hat you have to see that though
[5174.56s -> 5181.25s]  That's pretty much. They beat you. It's pretty much a moral obligation for every human being to watch the Christopher Nolan Batman movies
[5181.25s -> 5183.25s]  like please
[5187.30s -> 5189.74s]  You know, you're bring a spy yeah, hey I know I
[5190.86s -> 5192.86s]  Am aware of that. I realized that like about
[5193.58s -> 5196.90s]  Two or three seconds into that over. I just thought I'd let you know
[5196.90s -> 5197.26s]  Yeah
[5197.26s -> 5201.84s]  I realized because I realized especially when he ran the other direction when I ubered him and he turned left
[5202.06s -> 5205.90s]  And they went backwards. I was like wait a dip fights that way. What are you doing?
[5206.50s -> 5210.34s]  You could just have uber phobia
[5210.54s -> 5219.52s]  Good. Do I read any books? I do not don't really actually I take that back. I
[5220.28s -> 5225.32s]  Read some time. I read like graphic novels does that count? Oh?
[5226.55s -> 5229.19s]  That does not count, but there's words in there. Let's just look ones
[5230.23s -> 5232.31s]  Duck to Naples that makes good ones. Oh
[5234.57s -> 5247.04s]  Dog to Naples makes great great graphic novels the earthworm Jim guy. Oh, I didn't know he did that
[5247.44s -> 5261.10s]  Yeah, they're pretty good. At least like the art is very very interesting really awesome. I got you. I got you ballin Colin
[5261.54s -> 5271.55s]  You need help more than anybody. I'll make sure to get you. Oh my god
[5272.31s -> 5277.22s]  All right, you know what no more medic. It is pyro time want to see my backpack
[5277.86s -> 5283.93s]  Here you go. It's kind of all over the place right now ever since I gave everything away
[5283.93s -> 5291.37s]  I don't have any more like cool hats okay. I should stop stop doing this and actually shoot bullets
[5293.47s -> 5303.64s]  Why I gotta take that teleporter am I doing spies
[5304.64s -> 5315.26s]  Spies have no match for the pyro and except sometimes
[5315.78s -> 5319.13s]  No, don't don't don't don't don't don't oh
[5322.40s -> 5327.54s]  Come on. What did he even come from I have zero unusuals?
[5328.92s -> 5330.92s]  bad player
[5339.58s -> 5341.58s]  Yeah, I don't know how you guys
[5341.82s -> 5349.68s]  Aren't winning more well. We only have one minute. That's pretty much the end right there. Do I still like the gorillas?
[5349.68s -> 5354.62s]  Oh my god. Yes
[5354.62s -> 5359.71s]  Gorillas are the best band like ever. We're not gonna win this
[5360.55s -> 5365.59s]  Too much too much good stuff happening on it as a center. We lost it's over
[5366.19s -> 5371.65s]  It is over so in that in that case. You know you always got to do this. You're always gonna go spy
[5372.37s -> 5374.14s]  the skies as
[5374.14s -> 5378.68s]  An enemy heavy or something. Well, you know I'm gonna play I'm gonna go scout just so I can run away
[5379.08s -> 5388.17s]  I'm gonna take the coward way out. Why am I taking the teleporters? Let's go. So this is where we transition
[5388.41s -> 5391.53s]  What oh wait, can we maybe you
[5399.01s -> 5401.82s]  Yeah, it's over it's over
[5402.70s -> 5409.26s]  I'm gonna move on to some Diablo 3. Oh my god. Are we gonna find items or gold?
[5411.02s -> 5416.11s]  Hopefully gold cuz I need more. No, we've lost. Please. I hope I don't find any items
[5416.31s -> 5418.31s]  Oh
[5420.59s -> 5422.59s]  Well, thanks guys for playing if you got in thank you
[5423.03s -> 5427.95s]  And time to transition to Diablo 3 if you just came if you're wondering all but it's over though
[5427.95s -> 5432.12s]  It's this is all gonna be on YouTube later on today. So yeah
[5433.08s -> 5438.35s]  Thanks for playing dudes. Let's go on to Diablo 3. This is where we go
[5439.35s -> 5441.99s]  disconnect
[5441.99s -> 5443.19s]  quit
[5443.19s -> 5449.04s]  Yes, we're all do you sure? I don't know. I have replays. I don't want to lose. It's now
[5450.65s -> 5452.17s]  Diablo flee
[5452.17s -> 5460.58s]  Super Monday night combat. I've it's I
[5462.02s -> 5465.30s]  Can't I can't get into it. It's I don't know what it is. I'm not sure
[5465.30s -> 5470.14s]  I have a couple of friends now that are really starting to enjoy it, but I just can't I don't know why
[5470.58s -> 5475.42s]  They did just add a new game mode, which is weird. It's kind of like realism
[5475.42s -> 5478.58s]  I guess where everybody dies quicker
[5480.08s -> 5486.42s]  Really? Yeah, I just I need to get into it at some point. Maybe I'm not sure yet
[5486.42s -> 5490.58s]  But is this even in the right spot? I think it is not quite. Hold on
[5490.58s -> 5495.52s]  I'm gonna screens gotta go black for him second dudes
[5496.12s -> 5500.16s]  You can even rocket jump in that game and I still don't like it that much
[5501.49s -> 5507.07s]  So, I don't know what else there could be to encourage me to play
[5509.06s -> 5511.55s]  Maybe hats. Oh
[5512.11s -> 5519.04s]  There are hats then. Yeah, that's a good way to play screen region. Yeah, three
[5521.54s -> 5524.54s]  That
[5524.54s -> 5533.77s]  You know, you can stream with DX story and it's better in screen region. Really? Yeah. Whoa stream section. Oh my god
[5536.11s -> 5540.66s]  Do you use the x-tory? Oh, yeah. Yeah you do. Yeah, I do. I don't stream with it though
[5540.82s -> 5547.20s]  You should oh my good God every time I try to bring a stupid window right now. It'll be magic
[5547.40s -> 5550.70s]  All right. I'm gonna try this in one more time because this is being ridiculous
[5551.42s -> 5555.34s]  Okay
[5555.34s -> 5561.76s]  Streamception mania that was just like I felt like I was looking through a tunnel right there that might like I'm gonna like puke
[5562.22s -> 5573.69s]  Okay, love of everything that is sacred. Can we get this in the right spot? Yes, DX story telling you but DX story is
[5574.84s -> 5587.46s]  Expensive. No, okay. That's good enough. Good enough. Good enough. All right. Nobody likes steal my password
[5588.10s -> 5602.56s]  Stolen hacked nobody steal my stuff because I have like I have like really good stuff. No, I don't. All right
[5602.56s -> 5605.36s]  I'm on nightmare. Oh, you like my my like witch doctor name
[5605.96s -> 5616.87s]  Burglar he's the burglar and you and I in a game. I'm not in a game. I'm on axe 3 nightmare
[5618.04s -> 5624.74s]  No, that's I'm further than that. Well, you have to come help me. Okay, you have to
[5625.38s -> 5627.38s]  Okay
[5627.38s -> 5631.54s]  Are you sure you don't want to just kill asthma and 4,000 times? That's what I think
[5632.62s -> 5637.74s]  We're gonna make this game where you don't have to run the same bosses over and over again
[5639.14s -> 5644.27s]  Then we're gonna make asthma and give you all the experience every single cent of experience
[5644.27s -> 5650.42s]  I want in my bank account. So for hold on I gotta get over like the Diablo 3 lag for the first two minutes
[5650.42s -> 5654.62s]  I'm just like doing random moves. I wonder I you know, there's got to be a reason why that happens
[5654.86s -> 5661.76s]  It has to be because it's syncing you up with like the DRM or something like that has to be I don't know
[5661.76s -> 5663.96s]  But you need to invite me. That's right
[5664.48s -> 5673.02s]  Invite to the party. Yeah, and now I'm gonna reject it
[5674.24s -> 5676.86s]  But please be my friend
[5680.18s -> 5688.30s]  The turd burglar I made his name burglar because of like burger boy
[5693.50s -> 5695.14s]  Yeah
[5695.14s -> 5699.48s]  Yeah, you gotta get rid of it. You gotta get rid of the initial lag of Diablo 3
[5700.16s -> 5704.96s]  Whoo-hoo. Hooray
[5704.96s -> 5709.06s]  All right. I think we can do it
[5709.06s -> 5716.34s]  Well, it's the the reason why it lags even when I'm not streaming when I'm just playing just by myself
[5716.58s -> 5721.62s]  The first like two or three minutes every time you play Diablo 3 for some reason it just does
[5721.62s -> 5726.38s]  It's do a new move and it's like wait. What is this? Yeah, you have to like what it load Diablo 3 or anything
[5726.38s -> 5727.98s]  It's so it's sort of like Minecraft
[5727.98s -> 5732.56s]  That's like the only way I can really make an assumption to what it's kind of like, you know
[5732.56s -> 5736.82s]  Minecraft is like when you first start playing it's like loading every single thing in the world. See like
[5736.82s -> 5738.82s]  No, I have to load all this stuff
[5739.22s -> 5741.39s]  It'll even out in a minute. I promise
[5751.26s -> 5753.26s]  You know, what's a good game
[5754.46s -> 5757.02s]  Medium pizza medium a large cheese pizza. Yes
[5759.74s -> 5762.74s]  Let's go let's go with the lag
[5767.74s -> 5770.46s]  Alright, I want to get some Reyes and some uniques
[5771.10s -> 5775.97s]  Well, people still people people are still seeing streamception. No, they're not in this
[5776.21s -> 5788.45s]  Or is that just an old comment from somebody from a while back? I don't shoot arrows anymore. I'm taking what's going on people's thing
[5788.45s -> 5789.85s]  They're seeing
[5789.85s -> 5791.66s]  Shouldn't be
[5791.66s -> 5798.54s]  Let me watch my own stream make sure like nothing's happening. You should stream with your story
[5798.54s -> 5802.42s]  I gave the recommendation and I should stream the cops added
[5802.98s -> 5808.26s]  Teach you in two seconds every time I stream when I did the x-split game stream thing
[5808.90s -> 5816.50s]  For some reason I don't know why it like it lags. It lags really really terribly. Oh, no, we're not getting streamception
[5817.02s -> 5826.70s]  Looks okay. What about 720? That looks okay, too. Okay, just making sure nothing was happening
[5826.82s -> 5830.97s]  It's probably the YouTube comment system like all slow and dumb
[5831.49s -> 5833.49s]  That's where it is probs
[5837.22s -> 5844.78s]  So I I'm playing which doctor which doctor is very fun
[5845.54s -> 5847.71s]  Very good. Very cool. I
[5850.58s -> 5852.58s]  Am shooting bombs
[5852.86s -> 5855.03s]  bombs
[5855.03s -> 5860.79s]  There's actually pretty cool build with demon hunter. I found out that we just regenerate hatred like ridiculous amounts of it
[5861.39s -> 5863.39s]  You could use cluster our non-stop
[5864.11s -> 5866.11s]  Really our is amazing
[5866.15s -> 5868.23s]  That's pretty cool. Pretty damn cool
[5869.03s -> 5870.55s]  pretty snazzy
[5870.55s -> 5872.23s]  pretty snazzy
[5872.23s -> 5875.43s]  This guy's an elite in these
[5875.79s -> 5885.37s]  Did he killed my little buddy? Oh, he's back. Don't worry. I have a feeling maybe I shouldn't even be helping you. Why I
[5885.81s -> 5887.49s]  Don't know. I've got
[5887.49s -> 5889.49s]  5300 damage it feels
[5889.49s -> 5890.61s]  wrong
[5890.61s -> 5896.99s]  But I need the help get out of here
[5898.19s -> 5904.33s]  Already a rare really didn't think this one happened. I thought it was just gonna be the sea of blue, but I want one
[5904.87s -> 5907.70s]  What do I think of the spider-man reboot? I?
[5908.46s -> 5910.46s]  think it's um
[5911.14s -> 5916.82s]  It's not out. Well, I mean, I don't know I thought it was gonna be like a Christopher Nolan type reboot
[5916.82s -> 5919.84s]  But it's kind of everything's like all CGI and stuff
[5921.98s -> 5924.41s]  I want to see it
[5931.26s -> 5936.60s]  I'll probably watch it to be honest. I was a big spider-man fan. I loved the first movie second one was good, too
[5936.80s -> 5939.71s]  I
[5939.71s -> 5941.15s]  Don't get away
[5941.15s -> 5946.99s]  Hopefully this time they do anything with venom even later on hopefully he's not like a total d-bag
[5948.11s -> 5950.41s]  anything like that
[5950.41s -> 5956.61s]  Venom I have a cool face and giant teeth, but I pull my mask back to talk
[5958.05s -> 5961.85s]  Thanks. Yeah, I didn't really like the way they handled venom either. It was kind of lackluster
[5961.85s -> 5968.13s]  I'm mad at you because you took my girlfriend or something. I don't remember what his deal was wasn't he also in
[5969.09s -> 5974.41s]  The only in the movie for like 25 minutes the actual that I'm like symbiotic monster thing
[5977.70s -> 5981.62s]  And the way he beats him he's like oh you got a humiliating guy like that
[5982.94s -> 5987.73s]  Why are you gonna be like don't you are a good guy spider-man?
[5988.93s -> 5998.45s]  You guys want to see my ruins. I'll give you a little look see
[5999.17s -> 6000.89s]  looksy-doo
[6000.89s -> 6007.39s]  So this is poise. I'm using poison dart and fire bats and I have it so it's just pretty much pure damage
[6007.87s -> 6013.03s]  So take a look poison dart. I have it so it's and the the fire one
[6013.03s -> 6017.51s]  So just doesn't more just straight-up damage every time you hit somebody that is leveled up apparently oh
[6018.19s -> 6020.43s]  I'm sorry
[6021.15s -> 6027.24s]  Then fire bats. I have the poison ones actually I got a new one. I have ferrets hmm
[6027.24s -> 6029.40s]  I'll stick with the poison ones for now. I think
[6030.92s -> 6036.16s]  Ferrets yeah, I got the gargantuan the one that goes crazy when there's more than a few people around
[6037.08s -> 6038.52s]  Yeah, I
[6038.52s -> 6040.52s]  Got oh yeah
[6040.72s -> 6046.20s]  Soul harvest because it is just too good to not have intelligence. Is it giving you now?
[6047.40s -> 6053.36s]  102 for every enemy affected so I get I can get a fire like 550 in intelligence if I get five people oh
[6055.36s -> 6061.60s]  It's a that's a lot mass confusion and then spirit walk mass confusion makes every than everyone hit themselves pretty much and
[6061.92s -> 6068.76s]  Spirit walk is just amazing because it makes you pretty much unkillable. You just go like this you go whew and you run around
[6069.44s -> 6070.96s]  Very very awesome
[6070.96s -> 6076.40s]  So do you have ferrets? I don't know I don't have ferrets on let me turn on my
[6077.00s -> 6079.91s]  There it's like this a little my GPU
[6080.59s -> 6082.35s]  fan a little higher
[6082.35s -> 6085.02s]  Yeah, okay
[6085.02s -> 6087.40s]  Just to make sure
[6087.40s -> 6095.25s]  All right, we're gonna go we're gonna find this. This is the spider lady isn't it oh?
[6098.24s -> 6100.42s]  Yeah
[6100.42s -> 6109.34s]  She's down away still we missed her we missed her all right if you were just here for the TF2 then take it easy man
[6109.54s -> 6110.70s]  Thanks for coming
[6110.70s -> 6123.22s]  me this gold my ferrets they pick up gold for me do they really the most yeah the most important skill in the
[6123.22s -> 6124.94s]  Game is pick up gold
[6124.94s -> 6130.84s]  That is a really important skill because you have to like go move over and run over and they increase gold fine
[6130.84s -> 6132.60s]  Just for being ferrets
[6132.60s -> 6134.60s]  Like I didn't know ferrets did that
[6135.56s -> 6137.56s]  But they're rolling in it
[6139.09s -> 6144.41s]  Rolling in those ferrets, so we went the wrong way
[6146.23s -> 6150.78s]  Diablo 3 that's the name of the game in d3 going the wrong way
[6151.06s -> 6153.06s]  It almost feels sometimes like
[6153.42s -> 6158.86s]  It generates the map as you go somewhere they go people he went this way. Let's generate it
[6160.08s -> 6162.80s]  So many little spider freaks oh god
[6164.52s -> 6166.52s]  Come on go ahead go get him gargantuan
[6167.20s -> 6171.54s]  So though we were talking about the gargantuan that this little buddy that I have for a pet
[6172.16s -> 6177.99s]  And we can't at the conclusion that this is what he's doing so I'll try and do the voice
[6178.79s -> 6181.48s]  I'll definitely get it through this fight
[6181.60s -> 6187.15s]  They're ready, so this is look at how like cutie is
[6187.67s -> 6190.71s]  So where are you just like right where's that?
[6195.99s -> 6197.99s]  That's the noise he's making when he runs
[6199.59s -> 6202.75s]  To be actually right I hit this guy. I help you
[6204.35s -> 6206.35s]  Out it hurts
[6207.27s -> 6214.27s]  I just feel like he's just a big dumb cute, but I'm gonna die there's an elite right here. It's okay
[6215.13s -> 6217.37s]  I'll hold you
[6222.51s -> 6223.95s]  Confusion
[6223.95s -> 6226.34s]  Let's get a rare
[6226.34s -> 6227.02s]  So yeah
[6227.02s -> 6233.74s]  I thought I had a really cool skill that what could rival your mass confusion because it knocks everything back for like 10 seconds
[6234.18s -> 6236.18s]  Really it doesn't work on rares
[6236.90s -> 6241.22s]  Really like all rares are immune to knock back. That's kind of BS
[6241.78s -> 6248.34s]  Yeah, I was kind of gonna. Go like all knock back demon hunter. There's Diablo 2 mm-hmm
[6249.46s -> 6252.70s]  I probably still am but it's just kind of sucks that rares are gonna be like there
[6252.94s -> 6255.30s]  Okay, you might you might get one
[6256.14s -> 6259.40s]  Back up a little bit
[6259.40s -> 6271.98s]  German can you make a shout out to edgyl like in the stream just say your name? What's up edgyl?
[6276.21s -> 6277.81s]  Eggle
[6277.81s -> 6279.57s]  And go waffles
[6279.57s -> 6283.22s]  Yes, oh
[6283.22s -> 6288.74s]  God, yes, please actually don't like waffles. I go. I know that's blasphemous. I know
[6289.86s -> 6292.30s]  Like Elgin waffles are better naturally I mean
[6293.30s -> 6294.90s]  I
[6294.90s -> 6303.58s]  You know waffles are just too um it's almost like too much. It's too doughy ready for me same thing with pancakes
[6303.58s -> 6305.34s]  I'm not a big pancake person either
[6305.34s -> 6311.44s]  Wow, I did not need to know that about you
[6311.44s -> 6317.65s]  I don't think anyone you just know that about you like everyone is leaving the stream right now
[6318.37s -> 6320.37s]  Because I said that
[6320.57s -> 6324.61s]  Well, what's the point of watching this if this guy doesn't even like pancakes I?
[6325.61s -> 6330.17s]  Thought we could like bond on some sort of human level, but apparently not
[6331.45s -> 6335.42s]  Thought we were gonna be friends
[6335.66s -> 6340.96s]  Why would I want to be friends with you now? I need help do I have any potions that I'm not using I?
[6341.44s -> 6343.74s]  Gotta run back to town real quick
[6343.74s -> 6346.81s]  You don't like pancakes unsubbed
[6347.25s -> 6351.46s]  No, I love pancakes come back. I resolved me joking
[6352.18s -> 6354.38s]  You know I the only pancakes I like are
[6355.90s -> 6358.14s]  Chocolate chip pancakes, that's it
[6359.14s -> 6365.62s]  Everything else I'm not a big fan of are you just like trying to run your name into the ground what chocolate chip pancakes are really good
[6365.94s -> 6367.74s]  What's wrong with that?
[6367.74s -> 6373.40s]  Chocolate chip pancakes this is a breakfast food. We were talking you want to put chocolate chips
[6374.06s -> 6377.46s]  Would you put like chocolate chips and scrambled eggs and be like ah good idea?
[6378.66s -> 6382.76s]  Yeah, but scrimp eggs are like eggs. They're not like
[6383.72s -> 6385.24s]  Pancakes are sweet
[6385.24s -> 6393.07s]  You know let me give you a rebuttal would you put cheese on your pancakes? I'm sure that wouldn't be that bad
[6393.07s -> 6395.39s]  I don't think so. I don't know about that
[6396.31s -> 6398.31s]  What does cheese go badly with?
[6398.75s -> 6403.91s]  Besides chocolate chips like a glass of chocolate milk if you like put easy cheese in it
[6404.51s -> 6406.75s]  Well besides anything chocolate
[6409.35s -> 6414.04s]  Well when does chocolate go bad you just made my point for me
[6414.72s -> 6423.10s]  I'm trying to say chocolate doesn't go with anything. What is he just eat chocolate chocolate?
[6423.84s -> 6429.52s]  Chocolate ice cream chocolate milkshake chocolate strawberries. Yeah, those are all but
[6430.16s -> 6432.64s]  the point is
[6432.64s -> 6438.99s]  I'm right. I just said I just had to go back to town again because I forgot I went here to buy potions and I didn't
[6443.53s -> 6445.49s]  chocolate chip pancakes
[6445.49s -> 6448.18s]  That's the best part about Diablo 3
[6448.42s -> 6451.56s]  Is what you time to consider the important parts of life
[6451.96s -> 6456.08s]  There we weren't talking about this from playing tf2, but now we're down to the root
[6456.72s -> 6460.72s]  Now we have a little it's a little more laid-back. We get some time to discuss things laid back
[6461.32s -> 6464.36s]  It's a little more laid-back. I would consider this more serious
[6465.24s -> 6473.96s]  This is so serious. It's Diablo here. I am clicking on things and you're in town clicking on things
[6473.96s -> 6478.42s]  This is the most serious thing I've ever done in my life. Well snake. Oh, well, whatever. I'm just gonna come meet you
[6478.94s -> 6485.91s]  Yeah, this is act 3 nightmare if you guys are wondering this is the car I don't have this character in hell
[6485.91s -> 6487.91s]  He's only 46. He's little
[6488.31s -> 6493.03s]  And you are I had I need to come up and find you. Yeah, I figured you'd spawn on me
[6493.55s -> 6496.35s]  Well, I don't assume that I'm that intelligent
[6497.91s -> 6499.91s]  Okay, sorry
[6500.19s -> 6508.00s]  I've never been to comic-con. I can't I want to go. It'd be really fun. Oh, there's an elite right there not cool
[6508.52s -> 6510.52s]  Yeah, that guy
[6511.48s -> 6518.66s]  Comic-con is really interesting because it's isn't comic-con not just like comics. It's like pretty much about everything isn't it?
[6520.50s -> 6529.24s]  Kind of a little bit everything they have a lot of movie stuff there too, and I don't know I could have gone once but I
[6529.80s -> 6532.42s]  Might go to
[6532.46s -> 6539.97s]  This one on in New York, right? New York and in Chicago. I probably go to the New York one
[6539.97s -> 6541.97s]  I can have the chance if I had like the money
[6542.29s -> 6547.65s]  That's the most important thing go into all these events. It costs money and that's just money that I don't have
[6548.21s -> 6560.99s]  My gargantuan I need more health. I only have like 11,000 or so
[6563.78s -> 6565.78s]  Somebody wants to know
[6565.90s -> 6570.16s]  If you're gonna, oh god treasure goblin really get him get him buy some blues
[6570.74s -> 6572.90s]  No, no, no, this is not good at all
[6573.46s -> 6576.94s]  Mass confusion get him there. Oh god. This is just chaos
[6577.54s -> 6580.46s]  He's dead. Oh, and he dropped a rare
[6581.18s -> 6583.67s]  gay nightmare rare
[6585.43s -> 6587.43s]  Oh run away run away run away
[6590.02s -> 6595.67s]  Totally there. I'm gonna jail you and then order you so what I was gonna say is
[6596.51s -> 6601.81s]  Somebody wants to know if you're gonna continue your let's play they want to know there because they want to see the whole story
[6601.81s -> 6605.85s]  They said oh of Diablo 3. Yeah, I was gonna upload one last night
[6605.85s -> 6611.01s]  Actually, I did upload one but apparently never finished rendering. So it was like a fourth of a video
[6612.57s -> 6616.53s]  That's the worst thing see this video the one that right when this is the stream is done
[6617.25s -> 6622.37s]  Once it gets uploaded to YouTube it is gonna take like two hours to process. It's just like yeah
[6622.89s -> 6625.85s]  Yeah, I wish there was a way. I did a full circle
[6626.65s -> 6632.61s]  We did but that's we need XP and we need items. Well, I want I didn't even identify that but well, this is a one-hander
[6633.21s -> 6636.74s]  ooh
[6636.74s -> 6639.34s]  There's no dexterity on it though, but this is actually pretty good
[6639.90s -> 6644.89s]  You know, hey, I have this thing that I found. It's a blue. So, you know, it's good
[6645.41s -> 6648.91s]  Go over here. Do you want to look at this? Is this thing better than what you have?
[6649.49s -> 6652.82s]  I know. I mean you could maybe use that. Let me see. Oh
[6653.70s -> 6659.84s]  Geez, it's not better. That thing is not better. I will sell it. Um
[6662.21s -> 6665.28s]  I'm gonna be losing
[6665.40s -> 6670.86s]  2,000 life if I put this on but I'm gonna gain a ton of damage damage always need damage
[6672.30s -> 6680.65s]  That's 2,000 health I'm gonna lose but you know what it's worth it to do almost a thousand more damage. Yeah, it's all blue
[6681.41s -> 6685.61s]  We'll do it. Yeah, we'll do it and temporarily. I'm just gonna put a
[6687.36s -> 6691.09s]  This gem into it. All right
[6691.61s -> 6698.99s]  Lost a bunch of health. So I'm gonna be an absolute wuss. I have pants too. Maybe you want pants pants
[6698.99s -> 6707.57s]  I don't need pants. What do I? Oh god way better than what I have again. I'm gonna be losing health. Oh
[6709.55s -> 6720.10s]  Well, I'm losing health who cares put this in there for now just to have it in there for now
[6720.52s -> 6722.70s]  Alright
[6722.70s -> 6724.14s]  What's that?
[6724.14s -> 6726.42s]  What's all this? What's what are you dropping? I want to look
[6727.58s -> 6732.94s]  Imagine if this is what Diablo 3 was where you just stand in place and items fall. What's this? We're not what's that?
[6733.22s -> 6737.50s]  What's this? What's this this magic in the air? What's this? What's this?
[6738.22s -> 6742.64s]  All right, 20 German points to whoever figures out what that song is from
[6745.04s -> 6747.04s]  You remember what you can buy
[6747.08s -> 6754.14s]  German points. I don't think anything to be honest, but you can still buy a salad
[6754.14s -> 6764.26s]  You can buy a German salad for 15 German don't sell a German. Give it to me. There's probably chocolate chips in the German salad
[6764.26s -> 6769.98s]  I don't know if people want it, you know, I can't believe that you uh, but you don't like chocolate chip pancakes
[6769.98s -> 6775.42s]  That's that's some that's unbelievable. I've never actually had them just because the thought of that is absolutely rare
[6776.22s -> 6777.82s]  this
[6777.82s -> 6779.50s]  disgusting
[6779.50s -> 6781.98s]  Chocolate, oh, it's an offhand. Hold on. I'm oh
[6782.94s -> 6784.94s]  man, oh man
[6784.98s -> 6789.06s]  Gosh gee golly, I can't I don't have time to look at that, but I think it's better
[6789.74s -> 6793.16s]  I'm a witch doctor. I am a witch doctor
[6794.04s -> 6801.78s]  Star is a demon hunter. We're two best friends in Diablo 3. I hunt demons except sometimes they help me
[6803.20s -> 6806.34s]  Make sense make sense
[6807.14s -> 6816.82s]  the bones I carry a bow and
[6817.34s -> 6820.18s]  Confusion mass confusion. Everyone start fighting each other. Oh
[6822.32s -> 6824.32s]  My god too much
[6824.64s -> 6832.57s]  Good thing you don't have that health. Good thing. I need it. I could need it. I could use it
[6833.21s -> 6840.35s]  I'll get the lead watch out. We got an elite and he's got that pole move and he slows you down. That's just fantastic
[6841.11s -> 6842.75s]  He did
[6842.75s -> 6850.42s]  He has all the things you drop any
[6851.06s -> 6857.43s]  Yeah, those of you that said nightmare before Christmas you are you are a winner you get my right?
[6857.43s -> 6860.79s]  I'm gonna I'm gonna put my hand up to the screen right now and it's a high five. Hey, come here
[6860.99s -> 6862.51s]  Hey punk
[6862.51s -> 6863.91s]  Where you go?
[6863.91s -> 6866.53s]  What's that?
[6866.53s -> 6873.96s]  Wait, where do you keep finding these things? I don't floor. How come I'm not finding these in
[6874.98s -> 6876.98s]  It's way better than what I have. Thank you
[6877.38s -> 6881.72s]  That didn't I just find so many items. I don't know what to do
[6883.86s -> 6885.86s]  No, where the there it is
[6886.74s -> 6889.66s]  23
[6889.66s -> 6894.88s]  1947 intellect it's way better. It is way a critical hit chance though
[6896.37s -> 6901.21s]  It's got two point five percent crit on it. This does not have it. But oh, hey, what's your amulet?
[6901.89s -> 6904.73s]  I'll inspect you. I'll inspect you this time. I'm gonna put this on
[6905.45s -> 6907.50s]  I'm gonna put a
[6907.50s -> 6911.46s]  Vitality gem in that cuz I can't I'm under 10k health right now. This is awful
[6911.46s -> 6914.14s]  Check out this amulet and tell me if you're like interested
[6914.70s -> 6916.94s]  And you could just have it anyway
[6916.94s -> 6923.70s]  All right, like say seriously you have just replaced like six pieces of my gear
[6925.18s -> 6926.30s]  Okay
[6926.34s -> 6928.98s]  The critical hit damage this this I have a rare on 30
[6928.98s -> 6933.50s]  What do you think 30% more crit damage or extra health and a little bit more damage?
[6934.26s -> 6936.26s]  How much are you creating with mass confusion?
[6937.06s -> 6942.30s]  Ten million. I think I'm gonna leave it on because I do pretty big crits with a poison dart
[6942.86s -> 6954.50s]  It's a treasure Google
[6955.78s -> 6962.90s]  What I recommend getting d3 compared to d2
[6964.14s -> 6967.26s]  I probably not there is this really good game
[6967.82s -> 6972.56s]  Called you know, I think this is a treasure goblin. Where is he? Why is all his money over here?
[6973.06s -> 6976.68s]  Why was that money right there? Where's this goblin? That was the goblin like
[6977.40s -> 6979.86s]  you go
[6979.86s -> 6981.50s]  Diablo 2 is
[6981.50s -> 6986.58s]  One of my favorite games ever made so I'm very very biased when it comes to comparing Diablo 2 and Diablo 3
[6987.22s -> 6991.53s]  But Diablo 2 I mean this game is awesome. Yeah, I'm playing it right now
[6991.53s -> 6995.47s]  I've dumped a ton of time into it. But if you were a huge fan of Diablo 2
[6995.99s -> 7000.07s]  Then it's if you saw I did a review on this game already it's on the channel, but
[7000.79s -> 7004.23s]  It's it's kind of a letdown in the item department at least as of right now
[7004.23s -> 7012.59s]  They're gonna apparently they're gonna maybe potentially look at legendaries because where it stands right now a legendary item can be potentially worse than a blue
[7013.21s -> 7015.57s]  Which is that's that just shouldn't be happening
[7016.07s -> 7019.94s]  But for the most part, I mean if you've never played a Diablo game
[7019.96s -> 7024.80s]  This is a perfect time to get into it because this game is just it's very streamlined. It's very fun
[7024.96s -> 7030.92s]  Addicting I say yes, go buy it go buy it if you've never if you've never played Diablo before and you want to then
[7031.20s -> 7033.20s]  Check it out for sure. It's awesome
[7033.84s -> 7041.33s]  Star oh god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god too many balloons
[7042.37s -> 7045.75s]  Oh my god, my friend my my gargantuan
[7046.31s -> 7048.08s]  He died
[7048.08s -> 7050.60s]  No, he almost did he grew
[7051.44s -> 7052.48s]  stabilizers
[7052.48s -> 7057.20s]  You need to have like when you go home with your witch doctor on the wall
[7057.20s -> 7062.80s]  You need to put notches on the wall for how higher gargantuan grows. Oh, I want to look at something real quick
[7063.32s -> 7068.64s]  Give me one second. Okay, I'll hide in corner with you. How far behind is the stream?
[7069.24s -> 7073.30s]  Like the street like I think this I think my 720 stream is like seven years behind
[7074.10s -> 7076.10s]  that happens
[7076.22s -> 7078.06s]  Let me take a look at this
[7078.06s -> 7086.34s]  Because that's like so people are still like just answering that nightmare before Christmas and that was like five minutes ago
[7086.90s -> 7090.14s]  So I want to see I want to see just how far back it is
[7092.64s -> 7094.52s]  Somebody said 15 seconds
[7094.52s -> 7101.02s]  Actually, you know the YouTube comment system is probably just bugged like it always is. I probably said that before
[7101.82s -> 7103.26s]  Yeah
[7103.26s -> 7105.26s]  Why am I why I'm watching an ad?
[7111.45s -> 7116.08s]  Adception right there ads on top of ads on top of ads
[7117.00s -> 7119.60s]  They're advertising an ad go watch this ad
[7121.08s -> 7126.50s]  Please go watch this ad on top of this ad on top of this ad go watch this ad
[7127.86s -> 7132.37s]  Let me see. Let me see. Go watch this ad on top of there's a goblin and you're
[7132.97s -> 7136.29s]  Go watch this ad my entrance too low for this
[7137.29s -> 7144.08s]  Yeah, I guess if you're behind on 720 then oh my darling. What am I dead from?
[7144.92s -> 7147.16s]  If you're behind on 720 then
[7147.84s -> 7151.89s]  I died. Oh
[7152.97s -> 7154.92s]  Is that my fault?
[7154.92s -> 7156.08s]  No, it's my fault
[7156.08s -> 7160.20s]  If you're behind on 720 refresh the page because that'll put that I'll kick that'll get you back in check
[7160.68s -> 7163.32s]  Because some people are like five to ten minutes behind
[7164.04s -> 7174.76s]  Why don't I have ad block on? Um, because I mean at least for YouTube. I like to support youtubers
[7175.40s -> 7181.18s]  Like at least people that run ads on their videos. So if like if I have a friend or something that has ads
[7181.18s -> 7182.54s]  I usually keep it on
[7182.54s -> 7186.06s]  Just because I like to be nice to them. I don't
[7187.26s -> 7195.35s]  Very good guy plus can't add block block other stuff. It's that kind of not supposed to I don't think so
[7195.99s -> 7197.47s]  What's the not supposed to block?
[7197.47s -> 7203.43s]  I don't know like I remember like hearing that some it's some places like it might think something is an ad when it's not
[7203.43s -> 7213.21s]  I don't think I've seen anything like that. Do you have that block? I do I turn it off sometimes though
[7213.21s -> 7215.57s]  Usually when I watch streams or whatever. Yeah, I
[7217.05s -> 7218.69s]  Assume that's what a lot of people do cuz man
[7218.69s -> 7224.49s]  I guess it can get really annoying like if you're just browsing websites and it's like oh take over your entire screen with an ad
[7224.49s -> 7226.49s]  I hate those
[7226.65s -> 7232.81s]  Like four pages to tell you that this is an ad yeah, the worst thing is open and tell you to watch the other page
[7232.81s -> 7234.21s]  Oh
[7234.21s -> 7236.83s]  that
[7236.83s -> 7241.27s]  Did I have for a second? I thought we just beat her but I was looking at the chat
[7243.68s -> 7251.87s]  Kill the daughters of pain
[7253.18s -> 7254.78s]  destroyed
[7254.78s -> 7263.10s]  Wait, did she really did die? Didn't she? No, no, that's that's like her like introduced myself thing, isn't it?
[7263.10s -> 7265.06s]  Oh, yeah, this is the one where she doesn't even fight you
[7265.06s -> 7270.66s]  She just like shows up and like hey and then you shoot her once and she says no she just introduces herself
[7271.14s -> 7272.78s]  Hi, I'm a spider
[7272.78s -> 7276.46s]  Yeah, somebody said ad blockers can mess up some for honestly for this part
[7276.46s -> 7279.98s]  I was playing through when I was doing with this character and I was thinking to myself that
[7280.62s -> 7282.94s]  you probably were supposed to beat her there and
[7283.58s -> 7286.50s]  There was probably supposed to be a different boss later and they just are like
[7287.50s -> 7291.38s]  No, yeah, baby. No, I will just let it blittered run away
[7292.58s -> 7294.34s]  Really feels like that
[7294.38s -> 7296.38s]  Feels like that with a lot of stuff in this game
[7296.82s -> 7300.71s]  But there are they're patching it. There's apparently a big patch
[7300.71s -> 7303.75s]  they're working on for this game and I don't they haven't said anything about it, but
[7304.43s -> 7307.59s]  Let's let's wait and see what it is. I hope it's $15
[7309.43s -> 7311.43s]  Dollars it was $15
[7311.43s -> 7317.43s]  I would literally a dump a brick like a brick would I would I would have to run to the bathroom because a brick would
[7317.43s -> 7323.31s]  Be coming out. I just imagined you taking a very long drive to a nearby dump taking a brick out of your car
[7323.71s -> 7325.71s]  Just flopping it somewhere
[7325.75s -> 7330.15s]  That is how mad you are going that far out of your way
[7331.99s -> 7334.74s]  So close now
[7334.86s -> 7336.86s]  children of the corn
[7337.30s -> 7341.40s]  No, you destroyed the heart. I'm so mad, but I'll keep haunting you
[7342.12s -> 7344.12s]  like my body their implications
[7346.46s -> 7348.54s]  Anyone would want to bang his spider
[7352.44s -> 7360.29s]  Spider so seductive good job confusing those two bugs
[7361.21s -> 7366.40s]  oh
[7367.94s -> 7370.66s]  Hey, I did my part
[7370.66s -> 7374.62s]  It's not like these things are giving me they like died before it even came out. I
[7375.42s -> 7382.78s]  Did my part say I should have used it right now, but it's not cool down because I'm stupid
[7383.06s -> 7389.61s]  No, yeah, and this would be a great time to use it because there's like a bunch of blue people. Oh, I see a yellow
[7389.61s -> 7393.73s]  I see yellow. I'm not gonna pick it up now cuz I want to kill stuff first
[7394.77s -> 7401.06s]  Then the server shut down. Oh, that would be terrible if it did. I'm already overburdened
[7401.90s -> 7406.12s]  Really you were just in town legs. Okay legs
[7406.92s -> 7409.97s]  these are
[7409.97s -> 7416.37s]  Very good for someone else. That is not me. Oh, I will hold on to them. Oh
[7420.95s -> 7428.31s]  Gotta make a town run. It's all about that money all about the paper. It's all about that
[7429.21s -> 7438.67s]  Diablo 3 money once I get a million gold. I'll be happy slowly getting open floors
[7438.67s -> 7445.95s]  I have five hundred seventy one thousand going to get in there look at some of this stuff
[7445.95s -> 7452.66s]  I got a lot of just crappy rares that I just need to sell it's gonna take too long in the auction house
[7454.48s -> 7457.74s]  Mmm, I'll save these for later. Maybe I will try and sell them
[7458.36s -> 7465.20s]  Yeah, I think my auction house actually like cleared and all of the items that were in the completed section are gone
[7465.64s -> 7467.64s]  No, the items that I was something are gone
[7468.08s -> 7470.08s]  Weird that shouldn't do that
[7470.68s -> 7472.68s]  Yeah, I shouldn't but
[7473.64s -> 7480.83s]  Mmm, I mean just I got a stash a lot of this stuff. I I need after we kill
[7481.55s -> 7486.23s]  Asmodan I need like a million minutes to like sip sort through all this stuff that I have
[7488.80s -> 7494.78s]  Okay, I hope people are ready for like the most exciting part of this stream
[7495.52s -> 7498.36s]  Jerma going through his items and figuring out what he's gonna sell. I
[7499.04s -> 7513.42s]  Would decide him. Okay now I got room in my backpack. I'm just gonna sell these I don't need them
[7516.60s -> 7522.83s]  Whatever I'll hold on for now just because you destroyed the sin heart
[7526.89s -> 7528.89s]  Potions are expensive in this game
[7529.33s -> 7531.57s]  Yes, I concur
[7532.29s -> 7539.20s]  Potions are very expensive. That's why I got ferrets
[7541.61s -> 7542.65s]  ferrets
[7542.65s -> 7550.87s]  My buddy's here
[7550.87s -> 7557.29s]  You know, I'm gonna check out that other ruin for fire bats
[7558.13s -> 7567.74s]  Check it out money money money. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get the money. All right
[7568.58s -> 7574.50s]  Get a good a good a good a good rapidly summoned bats that seek out nearby enemies for 280% weapon damage as fire
[7574.50s -> 7576.50s]  Oh my god, I'll try that right now
[7576.74s -> 7582.32s]  Don't even know there's a lot of damage. I would recommend that to anyone
[7582.96s -> 7587.80s]  Who likes damage? I'll stick with blow dart just cuz I love blow dart. Let me check this out. Let's see. Oh
[7588.88s -> 7591.16s]  It's okay. Cool
[7591.96s -> 7594.96s]  It's a lot less group. Not really a crowd move anymore
[7595.60s -> 7600.86s]  It's kind of a single-target move. No, I should go to whimsy shire. I
[7602.52s -> 7608.36s]  I'm not at that stage. I'm a noob. I'm not ready for the ponies. I'm not ready for it yet
[7608.92s -> 7612.82s]  What is Hodor?
[7612.98s -> 7614.98s]  Holdor? What's that?
[7615.54s -> 7619.90s]  I guess I can just kind of stand back and do this. It does a lot of damage
[7620.78s -> 7627.90s]  Blows through mana like crazy though. I don't know if I like it. I'll try it for a little while
[7632.30s -> 7636.78s]  I'm not picking up pages of jewel crafting only because I'm it's not something I plan on doing at least right now
[7637.14s -> 7642.22s]  Once I have a ton of money. Well, then even then you would use tomes. Yeah, I mean it's I'm in nightmare right now
[7642.22s -> 7644.22s]  So the pages of jewel crafting
[7644.90s -> 7647.90s]  Aren't gonna get me really anything. Why is my dude dead?
[7648.70s -> 7655.16s]  run away
[7655.16s -> 7657.31s]  Go get him back
[7657.31s -> 7666.59s]  The reason why I didn't stream yesterday is because I was having internet problems for some reason. I couldn't I couldn't get 720 to
[7667.35s -> 7671.79s]  To go go through and even 360 was being really really slow and choppy. So
[7672.47s -> 7674.55s]  Something was going on with the internet. I don't know why but
[7675.31s -> 7678.27s]  Doing an extra long one tonight today this morning
[7680.24s -> 7682.74s]  extra extra extra
[7682.94s -> 7688.58s]  Re-extree read all about it. You can help me if you like it. I
[7690.92s -> 7697.37s]  Felt like it then if you're just joining us if you just you just kind of jumped in this is stars here
[7699.24s -> 7701.73s]  The star
[7702.53s -> 7710.44s]  47 there we go. Level it up. Ooh new runes. What are they?
[7711.28s -> 7714.80s]  Spirit walk rune. I'm gonna check that out
[7715.64s -> 7717.36s]  Yep, this would be on the channel later
[7717.36s -> 7719.36s]  for show for sure
[7719.48s -> 7722.30s]  for sure
[7723.06s -> 7726.96s]  Find the time is it?
[7727.88s -> 7729.88s]  20 of 11 a.m. Oh
[7731.17s -> 7736.69s]  Yeah, it tells you the time in Diablo. Yeah, remember we were talking about that. It's like, oh how much time have we lost?
[7736.69s -> 7740.69s]  Oh, there it is. And my DX story always covered it, but actually it's on the left now
[7742.13s -> 7755.04s]  The sin hot get that waypoint bats bats everywhere
[7755.64s -> 7765.15s]  That money give me that money yo money you should
[7765.87s -> 7770.48s]  See I used it a good time that time didn't are you proud of it? I am there was
[7770.88s -> 7772.88s]  There was a lot of reasons to do that. I
[7773.40s -> 7780.28s]  Might have to take off that passive skill what makes all my mana stuff cost more money
[7780.28s -> 7783.52s]  I mean more mana. I'll make sure my mana cost more money
[7784.52s -> 7788.35s]  I don't know why that cost more mana for what it's
[7789.31s -> 7790.91s]  It's
[7790.91s -> 7796.76s]  All of your damage is increased by 20% but every spell cost 30% more mana
[7797.24s -> 7800.84s]  But that's so good. That's it's so much more damage than I wouldn't be doing
[7804.69s -> 7818.48s]  Squeaky chair wait wait, I'll probably be playing Diablo 3. I mean today you mean today
[7821.34s -> 7823.34s]  Probably after we kill
[7823.90s -> 7825.90s]  Aspidan once we get to the last part of this act
[7825.90s -> 7832.90s]  I might take a break, but if you meant long term I'll be playing this game for probably a very long time
[7832.90s -> 7838.38s]  I would say if it turns out after all the patches and all the bug fixes and
[7838.94s -> 7843.42s]  After the initial launch period then if it all stays well, and it's all good
[7843.42s -> 7845.62s]  I'll be playing this game for a very very very long time
[7846.10s -> 7849.50s]  Yeah, okay, you're here this game. I'm excel
[7850.14s -> 7851.90s]  That we still need to play
[7851.90s -> 7856.74s]  Most mxd most extreme elimination channel. Yes. Did you actually install a t2? I?
[7857.62s -> 7859.62s]  actually did not
[7859.62s -> 7865.34s]  But I could that'll take two seconds. It's only like a one gig file to be honest. Oh, did you download it? I?
[7865.94s -> 7872.42s]  Think I have it downloaded so it shouldn't take that long to do when you download it and install it. Don't open it
[7872.42s -> 7880.84s]  Oh do that okay? I think actually I think I still have I think I downloaded it on this computer a long time ago
[7880.88s -> 7884.68s]  I think it's just still sitting like the installation file is just still sitting on the computer somewhere
[7887.57s -> 7892.17s]  I'd like to ask you a very serious question right now, okay? What is with the dudes in the background?
[7892.57s -> 7895.69s]  What is your theory on why you can never see their feet?
[7897.57s -> 7900.41s]  They're having a party and
[7901.55s -> 7906.10s]  They're the pinatas these poor guys
[7906.10s -> 7911.96s]  I mean as man would certainly have a much higher chance of winning this whole war if you just like
[7912.72s -> 7915.68s]  If it is unchanged yeah, you know watch out for the disco ball one of them
[7916.28s -> 7922.48s]  You unchain one of those guys. He will take out an entire city. Yeah, I don't know maybe they they're not that good at fighting
[7924.66s -> 7931.04s]  So they're big good at what are they doing? Why are they here? Well? I mean look think of it this way
[7931.64s -> 7936.64s]  These guys are probably not that strong at this point. They've been kind of chained up with like stuff in their heads
[7937.36s -> 7942.36s]  Why I don't think they'd be that tough anymore if you released them. They probably just fall over and go all right
[7943.36s -> 7947.54s]  We even if they just fell over that'd be a pretty big fall
[7948.26s -> 7950.26s]  Take a fall in the right spot
[7950.50s -> 7954.21s]  Maybe all around and be like change my diaper
[7955.95s -> 7962.23s]  You don't want that in her I get there wherever you're so close now so close oh
[7963.65s -> 7965.17s]  Yeah
[7965.17s -> 7969.93s]  You destroyed the sin heart. I can't believe you how dare you?
[7971.37s -> 7974.17s]  Second important question. Yeah, why is there no elevator here?
[7974.89s -> 7980.31s]  Yeah, and you know what follow-up important question. How did asthma Dan get down here?
[7980.83s -> 7984.12s]  Like did he didn't come down these stairs?
[7984.84s -> 7986.56s]  He's too big
[7986.56s -> 7991.16s]  Was he just like born in the bottom, and it just never goes anywhere. He doesn't ever go out I
[7992.19s -> 7996.51s]  Guess like oh, let me like here's my house my big asthma Dan house. I'm like a
[7997.19s -> 8000.07s]  75 foot tall like 9 million pound monster
[8000.23s -> 8005.51s]  Let me walk down my spiral staircase when you can like astral project images of your heads
[8005.51s -> 8007.51s]  You can talk shit to people
[8008.31s -> 8014.00s]  Like when that's your thing. I don't imagine you're going out. Yeah, I probably just sit there and like call ex-girlfriend
[8015.68s -> 8018.88s]  You have no hope put the foot dive
[8021.00s -> 8026.57s]  Eat it bats eat bats
[8026.97s -> 8033.37s]  More bats stand in the middle. Oh
[8034.05s -> 8040.22s]  God oh god. Oh god. Yeah, I need I need a more crowd move. This is this big very single target
[8040.78s -> 8044.86s]  It's not sure I'm gonna stick with it, or I'm gonna change boys in dark something else
[8045.62s -> 8052.00s]  Maybe he uses teleportation. That is a good theory. That is a good theory
[8052.68s -> 8054.48s]  Maybe I mean
[8054.48s -> 8056.85s]  He is the lord of
[8057.45s -> 8062.53s]  Sin here. I was saying be here. Did you say beer? I said beer
[8064.85s -> 8067.57s]  Yeah, as my dad like he owns a micro brewery a
[8068.21s -> 8070.09s]  lord of beer
[8070.09s -> 8073.79s]  How dare you do oh god? I'm dead. I'm gonna die right now
[8074.51s -> 8077.53s]  How dare you insult the lord of beer?
[8078.41s -> 8083.22s]  well, oh and the fear of my delicious hops and
[8083.86s -> 8089.38s]  Yeast no, I thought he was fearing. That's why he was always
[8091.06s -> 8094.34s]  The world here be lord of sin getting off on that
[8094.94s -> 8097.34s]  He is a weird one
[8097.34s -> 8103.44s]  He does live with a spider lady. That's hell-bent on making us like love her but hate her at the same time
[8104.08s -> 8109.52s]  Why won't you bang me? This is his roommate by the way, you know that that's as you that's what you got to live with
[8109.84s -> 8112.92s]  I would go for like his wife or something
[8114.12s -> 8120.28s]  Maybe he just got drunk one night and woke up down there is what someone said she just won't leave like oh, yeah
[8120.28s -> 8126.40s]  Where am I? I'm so shit face right now. What is this place? I own it now. Oh
[8126.92s -> 8129.67s]  This is mine. Oh
[8133.25s -> 8142.34s]  This is mine
[8143.34s -> 8147.78s]  Why these giant tall guys are here, all right, this definitely gets comment of the stream
[8148.66s -> 8154.38s]  Damn it. I want to take a dump. Well, you guys talk louder so I can hear you from the crap. Oh
[8155.42s -> 8157.92s]  my god, oh
[8159.24s -> 8167.75s]  My goodness get her yeah, I can't even stun that that move only works on like actual enemies
[8168.53s -> 8171.21s]  unfortunate
[8171.21s -> 8173.77s]  All right, kill it before the teleport kill it before the teleport
[8173.77s -> 8176.20s]  Oh
[8176.72s -> 8183.60s]  No, I don't I don't I unless you're like a normal and one-shot or maybe we're getting it
[8187.64s -> 8192.36s]  Now blow up at one of asthma dance like four hearts, is he a cow or something?
[8193.76s -> 8197.17s]  He must be a cow don't know cows. Oh my god, I'm an idiot
[8198.93s -> 8205.78s]  Cows have multiple stomachs not multiple hearts. Oh, is he like a cow? He has like four hearts
[8206.42s -> 8213.37s]  Derp, oh look. Oh, come on. It's starting to make sense. What's what is it? This is one of those big guys chests
[8213.69s -> 8216.77s]  It's ripped open and the heart is placed over here
[8217.29s -> 8224.17s]  What what you see? That's why would they do such a thing and then the heart powers?
[8226.10s -> 8228.28s]  Duracell I
[8229.04s -> 8234.08s]  Don't get how the hearts power is well, how come then look at this guy?
[8234.08s -> 8237.36s]  How come this guy isn't like has a sin heart? Maybe he's not cool enough
[8237.40s -> 8242.20s]  I guess they're I guess they're like harvesting them. Okay, seriously seriously. Look at this
[8242.40s -> 8246.80s]  There is no way asthma Dan can fit down this staircase. Look at this. There's no way
[8247.60s -> 8251.26s]  Look at this. Look at look at up. Look at the height. I'm pointing at the screen right now, by the way
[8251.26s -> 8255.02s]  I don't know why the height of this ceiling look at this
[8255.02s -> 8258.18s]  Oh, I'm gonna go in my door like he wouldn't even be able to get in here
[8258.18s -> 8262.66s]  He just jumps down like he doesn't use the stairs. He just wrong bat and he rolls off the edge
[8264.42s -> 8268.58s]  Somebody asked how is this early morning?
[8268.82s -> 8274.50s]  I started this anymore. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I started the straight. I've been going for a couple hours at least a few hours
[8275.26s -> 8277.26s]  It was it was early morning
[8277.46s -> 8284.06s]  When I started I am here. So after this I'm probably gonna
[8284.62s -> 8288.42s]  Close the stream out for a little while. I might come back. I'm not sure though
[8288.94s -> 8294.14s]  Probably not because I want to get some food and my way I might go to the gym but get the way point
[8294.54s -> 8296.54s]  We're about to kill asthma then
[8296.54s -> 8298.70s]  This is on nightmare. So he might be a little tough
[8299.34s -> 8301.71s]  Yeah, okay, he might be super tough
[8304.66s -> 8307.27s]  Everyone's gonna be very disappointed when he dies
[8309.55s -> 8313.32s]  That's that's that's that's that's

[8336.50s -> 8337.42s]  to YouTube
[8337.46s -> 8345.05s]  But it'd probably be about three and a half four hours the whole thing I would assume. Oh

[8354.48s -> 8358.44s]  Well, you wait now you're behind. I don't even know time zones how you work
