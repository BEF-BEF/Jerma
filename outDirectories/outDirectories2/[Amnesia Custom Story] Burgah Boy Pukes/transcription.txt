[0.31s -> 11.18s]  Oh, we got like a director over here, apparently, like giving me like a handshake or something.
[11.18s -> 17.18s]  Hey, what's going on, everybody? Jerma here with a very special guest. You know, you all know this guy, maybe, potentially.
[17.18s -> 18.18s]  Hi.
[18.18s -> 24.18s]  That's Burger Boy. We're doing this via satellite from Burger Boy's house. I mean, we're actually in outer space right now.
[24.18s -> 28.18s]  But no, we're gonna be doing Scare Saturdays over Burger Boy's house.
[28.18s -> 34.18s]  I tweeted this out, like, a couple hours ago, and everyone was like, you gotta have Burger Boy in that friggin goddamn video.
[34.18s -> 40.18s]  So here he is. And we're gonna play. What the hell are we playing? Black Death. Black Death.
[40.18s -> 41.18s]  The Plague.
[41.18s -> 45.04s]  Yeah.
[45.04s -> 47.79s]  Is this kid ready to go? Are you ready?
[47.79s -> 48.79s]  I'm ready.
[48.79s -> 49.79s]  Are you ready?
[49.79s -> 50.79s]  Scare Saturday.
[50.79s -> 51.79s]  Let's do it.
[51.79s -> 56.18s]  Barrels, get out of here. Barrels, get out of here.
[56.18s -> 61.06s]  All right, we gotta find the lantern. Burger Boy has like no idea how to play these games, by the way.
[61.06s -> 67.56s]  And neither did I until like a week ago. So we have to find the lantern. I know that. Let's just open the door.
[67.56s -> 70.85s]  All right.
[70.85s -> 74.02s]  Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is there anything? There's gotta be something in here I need to pick up.
[74.02s -> 81.36s]  There's an exit right there. Don't think that really matters. Let's just go.
[81.36s -> 87.29s]  There's voice acting in this one.
[87.29s -> 88.46s]  Holy crap.
[88.46s -> 91.47s]  Nothing under there.
[91.47s -> 95.34s]  Ooh, ice.
[95.34s -> 98.58s]  Beware when standing in the eye. No insanity. I get you.
[98.58s -> 103.58s]  To whoever finds this means. I probably didn't make it. I had to go back inside to get my brother.
[103.58s -> 109.46s]  We got split up in there. If you're reading this turn back now, that ain't gonna happen.
[109.46s -> 112.46s]  This is Scare Saturdays, baby. We push through no matter what.
[112.46s -> 114.89s]  Except for last week when I rage quit.
[114.89s -> 118.15s]  Second floor key.
[118.15s -> 122.25s]  All right, I got the key.
[122.25s -> 127.20s]  Go in this room.
[127.20s -> 128.20s]  In there.
[128.20s -> 131.81s]  Another note.
[131.81s -> 136.05s]  I have a headache. Yeah, you're giving me a headache game.
[136.05s -> 144.90s]  Gonna throw up. I'm gonna throw up.
[144.90s -> 147.90s]  God damn it, man. It's a fucking statue.
[147.90s -> 152.85s]  Yeah, just wait till you're doing this. It sucks.
[152.85s -> 153.85s]  Come on.
[153.85s -> 158.50s]  It has to be another way past this door. This door won't open.
[158.50s -> 165.22s]  Where's the lantern?
[165.22s -> 170.81s]  I can't open this. So did I go down this way yet?
[170.81s -> 172.94s]  No.
[172.94s -> 174.94s]  Okay, maybe it's because I didn't go down here.
[174.94s -> 177.02s]  God damn it!
[179.77s -> 183.99s]  All right, so for those of you that have no idea.
[183.99s -> 186.99s]  Okay, so me and him were just trying to figure out where the hell we were going.
[186.99s -> 191.06s]  And that thing just changed. Great. Fantastic. Thank you.
[191.06s -> 192.06s]  Thank you, mod.
[192.06s -> 194.43s]  I still don't have the lantern.
[194.43s -> 195.74s]  Got a key, though.
[195.74s -> 196.74s]  Great key.
[198.42s -> 200.42s]  That scared the absolute shit out of me.
[203.18s -> 206.18s]  Oh, is Burger Boy gonna like die because he saw that?
[206.18s -> 208.18s]  Hold on. Make sure I don't miss anything, man.
[208.18s -> 211.18s]  I feel like I'm missing so much stuff.
[211.18s -> 212.48s]  Maybe not.
[214.55s -> 220.48s]  Okay, this is the chamber.
[220.48s -> 223.13s]  Can we knock it in here?
[223.13s -> 226.01s]  Okay, no, here's the key.
[226.01s -> 228.95s]  I cannot use the item in this way. I can't use the key.
[228.95s -> 229.95s]  Where's that key go then?
[229.95s -> 230.95s]  Maybe the first floor door.
[230.95s -> 231.95s]  Okay, right, right, right, right.
[231.95s -> 233.95s]  Black. It's pitch black.
[237.47s -> 239.97s]  I hate that shit so bad.
[239.97s -> 243.87s]  All right, let's use that key.
[243.87s -> 247.26s]  What about if we go in here?
[249.26s -> 252.27s]  What just happened?
[252.27s -> 255.51s]  A loud noise was in my ear and it threw me back a thousand feet.
[255.51s -> 257.51s]  Hey, okay.
[257.51s -> 262.82s]  I'm assuming there's something on this desk.
[262.82s -> 264.19s]  Hey, look, a note.
[264.19s -> 266.50s]  They're watching you.
[266.50s -> 269.53s]  Oh, are they?
[269.53s -> 271.53s]  Kate, give me the Kate.
[271.53s -> 275.53s]  Third floor exit and the true horrors of this castle lie down in the chamber.
[275.53s -> 277.53s]  They're rapping at my chamber door.
[277.53s -> 279.47s]  Let's go.
[279.47s -> 281.97s]  Hi. Hi, guys.
[281.97s -> 282.97s]  Oh, you want to, like, scam me?
[282.97s -> 284.97s]  Get through all your heads.
[284.97s -> 287.97s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[287.97s -> 288.97s]  Who wants to go now?
[288.97s -> 289.97s]  You want to dance?
[289.97s -> 290.97s]  You want to dance?
[290.97s -> 291.97s]  You fucking...
[291.97s -> 292.97s]  Let's go.
[292.97s -> 296.34s]  Wait, what key do I just get?
[296.34s -> 297.34s]  Hey, pay attention.
[297.34s -> 299.97s]  You got the third floor exit key.
[299.97s -> 302.78s]  Okay, let's get out of here.
[302.78s -> 303.78s]  I'm going to turn...
[303.78s -> 304.78s]  You know, I don't want to run into lamp oil.
[304.78s -> 306.78s]  I'm just going to run out of here like this.
[306.78s -> 311.26s]  Okay.
[311.26s -> 314.08s]  I don't like the frigging blood everywhere.
[314.08s -> 318.24s]  Oh, that's the second floor.
[318.24s -> 320.91s]  Did I miss anything in here?
[320.91s -> 321.91s]  What about...
[321.91s -> 322.91s]  No, I can't go in that door.
[322.91s -> 324.98s]  I already tried.
[324.98s -> 325.98s]  Okay.
[325.98s -> 327.67s]  Let's go.
[327.67s -> 329.67s]  To the Chamber of Secrets.
[329.67s -> 331.67s]  To the Chamber of Secrets.
[331.67s -> 334.81s]  Get off me, bro.
[334.81s -> 336.81s]  Welcome to the Chamber of...
[338.81s -> 341.18s]  He's still right there.
[341.18s -> 343.74s]  He's still next to me.
[343.74s -> 344.74s]  Get the fuck away from me.
[344.74s -> 345.74s]  What?
[345.74s -> 349.58s]  He's right there.
[349.58s -> 351.01s]  What?
[351.01s -> 365.20s]  No!
[365.20s -> 372.22s]  Did you just seriously puke?
[372.22s -> 375.22s]  Did you seriously just puke?
[375.22s -> 376.22s]  Oh my god.
[376.22s -> 380.22s]  Live on camera, Burger Boy just puked.
[380.22s -> 382.22s]  And swallowed it.
[382.22s -> 387.32s]  Oh my god.
[387.32s -> 388.32s]  Okay.
[388.32s -> 393.61s]  I can't believe that just happened.
[393.61s -> 397.34s]  You better keep that in.
[397.34s -> 401.21s]  Oh, that's staying in.
[401.21s -> 402.77s]  There's other people there.
[402.77s -> 403.77s]  You can't see them.
[403.77s -> 405.77s]  Hold on, wait.
[405.77s -> 407.77s]  Alright, I gotta go to the chamber now.
[407.77s -> 410.77s]  Alright, we got a live puke from Burger Boy.
[410.77s -> 417.03s]  The best part was he chased you until he got wicked close to you and then disappeared.
[417.03s -> 419.03s]  Dude, he chased me through the whole freaking hallway.
[419.03s -> 422.03s]  The whole point was to scare the ever-living shit out of you.
[422.03s -> 423.03s]  That's like never happened.
[423.03s -> 424.03s]  I think, you know what?
[424.03s -> 426.03s]  I think a lot of people are probably gonna say in the comments,
[426.03s -> 430.03s]  that was from using this light and walking around with the light out so we could see where I was.
[430.03s -> 431.03s]  Makes sense.
[431.03s -> 433.03s]  Alright, I gotta go...
[433.03s -> 434.03s]  Do I have a key?
[434.03s -> 435.03s]  No.
[435.03s -> 439.15s]  Okay.
[440.15s -> 441.15s]  Can I open this?
[441.15s -> 442.15s]  I can't open it.
[442.15s -> 444.16s]  Are you kidding me?
[444.16s -> 445.16s]  Oh, key, key, key.
[445.16s -> 446.16s]  Chamber exit key.
[446.16s -> 448.16s]  And this is my last letter.
[448.16s -> 449.16s]  Be careful.
[449.16s -> 451.16s]  I saw some unhuman creature lurking down in the chamber.
[451.16s -> 453.16s]  Oh, that's fantastic.
[453.16s -> 456.58s]  What?
[456.58s -> 458.14s]  Hi.
[458.14s -> 459.14s]  I hear the music.
[459.14s -> 460.14s]  I hear the music.
[460.14s -> 461.14s]  I hear the music.
[461.14s -> 462.14s]  Where is this guy?
[462.14s -> 463.14s]  Where is this guy?
[463.14s -> 464.14s]  Where is this guy?
[464.14s -> 465.14s]  Where is this guy?
[465.14s -> 466.38s]  Where is this guy?
[466.38s -> 473.18s]  Where is this guy?
[473.18s -> 474.18s]  Where is this guy?
[474.18s -> 475.18s]  Get away from me.
[475.18s -> 476.18s]  Get away from me, you prick.
[480.18s -> 482.18s]  I should have closed the door.
[483.18s -> 488.26s]  Hey, look it, we're back.
[488.26s -> 489.26s]  Your turn.
[492.26s -> 493.26s]  I can't believe you fucking threw up.
[493.26s -> 495.26s]  I cannot believe you fucking threw up.
[498.26s -> 502.26s]  Let's see if like, Jerm is just like a baby or if this is like really scary.
[503.26s -> 506.84s]  No, it's definitely really scary.
[506.84s -> 507.84s]  I've played this game before.
[508.84s -> 511.49s]  Yeah, I'm running.
[512.49s -> 513.49s]  Where?
[513.49s -> 514.49s]  No!
[515.49s -> 522.74s]  What?
[526.18s -> 527.18s]  What just killed him?
[527.18s -> 528.18s]  What killed you?
[528.18s -> 529.18s]  It killed me from behind.
[535.18s -> 536.74s]  All right.
[536.74s -> 538.74s]  Well, I recant my statement.
[539.74s -> 541.74s]  It's not so easy when you're in a driver's seat, is it?
[544.49s -> 545.49s]  That's probably going to happen again.
[546.49s -> 547.49s]  This is probably the right way to go.
[547.49s -> 549.49s]  I just like freaked out and ran away.
[549.49s -> 550.49s]  No, it wasn't.
[550.49s -> 551.49s]  No, it wasn't.
[551.49s -> 553.94s]  The key.
[553.94s -> 556.98s]  How long have you been in this room?
[557.98s -> 558.98s]  The Enchiridion?
[559.98s -> 560.98s]  With it?
[561.98s -> 564.11s]  You're pretty low on lamp oil.
[565.11s -> 566.11s]  Yeah, good point.
[567.11s -> 568.11s]  Okay, well this is the right way.
[577.10s -> 579.36s]  Apparently.
[579.36s -> 580.36s]  Those chairs didn't jump for no reason.
[581.36s -> 586.06s]  Arm?
[586.06s -> 588.13s]  What else we got here?
[590.97s -> 591.97s]  It's definitely this.
[591.97s -> 592.97s]  Yeah, again.
[592.97s -> 593.97s]  Oh yeah, baby.
[598.22s -> 599.22s]  He's getting ready for a scare.
[600.22s -> 601.52s]  Oh!
[603.95s -> 613.19s]  Oh, he's smart.
[614.19s -> 616.19s]  Always got to shut the doors behind you.
[617.19s -> 619.19s]  Have you ever seen a horror movie, Jerma?
[619.19s -> 620.19s]  It's like the key.
[621.19s -> 624.35s]  Sanity what?
[624.35s -> 625.35s]  Dangerously low.
[625.35s -> 628.32s]  I don't know.
[629.32s -> 630.32s]  I'm in like hell now.
[633.10s -> 634.10s]  I made it.
[634.10s -> 636.36s]  I...
[636.36s -> 637.79s]  Try moving.
[637.79s -> 638.79s]  I made it.
[638.79s -> 643.74s]  I am.
[643.74s -> 644.74s]  That's it.
[644.74s -> 645.98s]  We did it.
[645.98s -> 646.98s]  We beat the game.
[646.98s -> 647.98s]  Woo!
[648.98s -> 650.98s]  Although Burger Boy was only there for like 30 seconds.
[651.98s -> 652.98s]  Well, it was a good 30 seconds.
[653.98s -> 656.12s]  Thanks.
[656.12s -> 658.12s]  Hey, Burger Boy's channel is going to be in the description.
[658.12s -> 660.12s]  His channel sucks, but like just go like subscribe.
[660.12s -> 661.12s]  Wicked bad.
[661.12s -> 663.12s]  You can like watch me like sleep on camera.
[664.12s -> 666.12s]  Alright, well thanks everybody for watching.
[666.12s -> 668.12s]  Uh, Burger Boy you want to do an outro?
[668.12s -> 669.12s]  Alright.
[669.12s -> 670.12s]  Thanks everybody for watching.
[670.12s -> 673.12s]  This has been Scare Saturdays with Burger Boy and Jerma.
[673.12s -> 674.12s]  And as always.
[674.12s -> 675.12s]  Take care everybody.
[675.12s -> 678.12s]  And don't puke like he did during this whole video.
[678.12s -> 679.12s]  Bye.
