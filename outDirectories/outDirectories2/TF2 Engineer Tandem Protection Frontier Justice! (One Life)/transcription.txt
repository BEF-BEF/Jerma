[0.31s -> 18.44s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerba here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm going to be playing as the Engineer.
[18.44s -> 23.44s]  And this is going to be a big Sentry Engineer, no mini-Sentry. I want to show you guys a couple of things.
[23.44s -> 28.44s]  Well actually, show you one thing, because I kind of stand in the same spot the entire gameplay.
[28.44s -> 34.44s]  But that is beside the point, because obviously when you are playing as a big Sentry Engineer, you got to stand in the same spot.
[34.44s -> 37.44s]  And if you don't, your stuff is going to get destroyed.
[37.44s -> 42.74s]  Also playing on the map Upward on Defense, which is a very good Engineer map.
[42.74s -> 47.74s]  It's a very big map, but it's great for Engineer, because there's so many different spots you can put a Sentry gun here.
[47.74s -> 53.74s]  As you'll see, there are like three or four Engineers on this team, which is why near the end of the gameplay...
[53.74s -> 60.98s]  By the way, the end of the gameplay, I kill almost the entire team without my Sentry.
[60.98s -> 68.42s]  So I won't tell you what happens, but it's very, very cool. The last two minutes of this gameplay are very, very cool.
[68.42s -> 72.42s]  So keep that in mind while you're watching the slug gameplay, I guess.
[72.42s -> 76.42s]  Well, it's not a slug gameplay. No one's going to chant slug at this.
[76.42s -> 81.42s]  It is kind of slow near the beginning, but I wanted to tell you guys why my Sentry gun is here.
[81.42s -> 84.42s]  And instead of using the last two minutes in a clip...
[84.42s -> 87.42s]  No, but this is all a one-life gameplay, by the way. I forgot to mention that.
[87.42s -> 93.72s]  This is all a one-life gameplay, so I figured it's been a little while since my last one-life gameplay.
[93.72s -> 96.72s]  So I have the whole thing here for you to enjoy.
[96.72s -> 100.90s]  And my Sentry, now I'm getting off track here, my Sentry gun.
[100.90s -> 106.14s]  The reason why it's right here is because there was already a Sentry up on the top little nest area.
[106.14s -> 114.31s]  Right here, the last point on upward, it's very, very obvious to put your Sentry gun up in that little loft back behind me, sort of, to the left.
[114.31s -> 116.31s]  That is the best place for a Sentry gun here.
[116.31s -> 119.31s]  But if it's already taken, you see, here's the bad part about that spot.
[119.31s -> 124.31s]  If that spot is already taken, it is very vulnerable to people at these windows.
[124.31s -> 129.62s]  See these two windows up straight ahead here in the top area? Right up to my top right.
[129.62s -> 137.62s]  If a Soldier gets in that window, he will just harass the crap out of anybody that has a Sentry in that loft.
[137.62s -> 140.62s]  Now, if you have a Sentry right here, that prevents that from happening.
[140.62s -> 143.62s]  Because if they pick their nose up, if they pick their nose and eat it...
[143.62s -> 145.92s]  What? If they pick their...
[146.92s -> 151.92s]  If they poke their nose out here, they're gonna get shot by my Sentry instantly.
[151.92s -> 160.16s]  And vice versa, if somebody comes around this corner here, whether that be a Demoman or a Heavy, they will take this Sentry out in one second.
[160.16s -> 163.16s]  My Sentry, where it is right now, will not stand a chance.
[163.16s -> 167.16s]  Unless, of course, it is being protected by another Sentry.
[167.16s -> 169.16s]  See, here's the thing about Team Fort, look straight ahead.
[169.16s -> 175.16s]  If you see this guy that has the Sentry Gun right here, he is gonna take all the brunt of the guys coming around the corner,
[175.16s -> 178.16s]  and I'm gonna take care of the guys that come through the top windows.
[178.16s -> 184.46s]  And the guy up top, I'm actually not sure if he's there anymore, he is totally protected to do whatever he wants.
[184.46s -> 190.46s]  He is kind of the anchor of the team right now, because if my Sentry goes down, or if this guy's Sentry goes down,
[190.46s -> 193.46s]  we have another line of defense, and it's a great Sentry placement.
[193.46s -> 199.77s]  So that's the thing I'm trying to talk about right now, is tandem Sentry Gun protection.
[199.77s -> 204.12s]  If you have two or three Sentry Guns on one team, and they're all facing...
[204.12s -> 208.12s]  because in Team Fortress, what I was gonna say before, before I cut myself off right there,
[208.12s -> 214.42s]  in Team Fortress, there are probably three or four ways to come at an enemy team.
[214.42s -> 222.42s]  Whether it's a left tunnel or a right walkway or straight on, if you can block all three or four of those places with Sentry Guns,
[222.42s -> 227.66s]  it's gonna be very difficult for the enemy team to do anything, because even if they come through with an Uber,
[227.66s -> 233.66s]  let's say an Uber Demoman comes over and takes out one of the Sentry nests that's over on Dustball,
[233.66s -> 235.66s]  right on the right side, he destroys the Sentry.
[235.66s -> 238.66s]  They walk 20 more feet, and there's another Sentry.
[238.66s -> 241.66s]  And then after that, there's gonna be another Sentry up top somewhere,
[241.66s -> 243.66s]  so you can see where it can get really, really difficult.
[243.66s -> 247.97s]  And Engineers, while I play out this last minute of the gameplay here,
[247.97s -> 250.97s]  this is where I kill almost the entire team with Revenge Crits.
[250.97s -> 253.97s]  I didn't want to ruin it in the beginning, but it's very, very interesting.
[253.97s -> 258.97s]  So what I was gonna say before this video ends is, Engineer, this is the reason why I love Engineer.
[258.97s -> 262.21s]  This is the reason why it is my favorite class.
[262.21s -> 267.21s]  Yes, it is my favorite class. If you're new to the channel, this is my favorite class, Engineer.
[267.21s -> 272.38s]  And I want to say, if the Medic is the quarterback, then the Engineer is the linebacker,
[272.38s -> 279.38s]  or the offensive lineman, or one of those big, bulky, surly guys that protects everybody else.
[279.38s -> 282.38s]  And that's why I like this class so, so much.
[282.38s -> 286.38s]  You feel like you are the protector. You are the defender.
[286.38s -> 290.38s]  And you really are. And it makes you feel good when you have a point really, really secure.
[290.38s -> 294.38s]  And you got your dispenser up and you're healing people, replenishing people.
[294.38s -> 298.38s]  I just like classes like that. When I played World of Warcraft, I played a priest.
[298.38s -> 303.38s]  I played the support healers and stuff. So that is why I love the Engineer.
[303.38s -> 308.38s]  I also love the Medic too, but I'd say the Engineer definitely trumps the Medic in my favorite class.
[308.38s -> 313.56s]  But yeah, this video is already over. I'm like talking on black screen right now.
[313.56s -> 317.56s]  So thank you guys so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[317.56s -> 323.15s]  And I will catch you guys all next time. So take care, everybody.
