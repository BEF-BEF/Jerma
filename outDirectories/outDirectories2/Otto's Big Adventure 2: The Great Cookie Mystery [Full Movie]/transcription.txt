[0.31s -> 14.50s]  Hi everybody, it's me, Arto. This is my second movie, Arto's Big Adventure 2. This is where I invite all my friends over and we eat cookies.
[14.50s -> 21.26s]  Let me introduce you to all my friends. This is Moose and Mari. They're a couple. They're married.
[21.26s -> 22.26s]  Hi. Hello.
[22.26s -> 23.82s]  This is Boo Boo.
[23.82s -> 28.82s]  Hello. Oh jeez, I'm not that good on camera. Please don't put the camera on me right now.
[28.82s -> 31.82s]  And this is me, Arto. Hi.
[31.82s -> 34.82s]  These are so good. I love these.
[34.82s -> 36.82s]  Oh jeez, these are the best cookies I've ever eaten in my entire life.
[36.82s -> 38.82s]  Mmm, yeah, they're actually kind of gross.
[38.82s -> 44.82s]  Mmm, that was good. Now that we ate our delicious cookies, it's time to play outside in the snow. It's snowing.
[44.82s -> 48.57s]  Let's go outside. What's that, a leaf?
[48.57s -> 50.57s]  Give me the leaf. I don't know what this is, but I'm going to keep it.
[50.57s -> 52.57s]  Hold on now. I've got big bones here. I'm coming, I'm coming.
[52.57s -> 55.57s]  Let's go and see what that is. Everybody, let's go. Come on, come on, come on.
[55.57s -> 56.57s]  Hey.
[56.57s -> 59.02s]  What is it?
[59.02s -> 62.02s]  Have you guys tried the snow yet? Oh, the snow is just so full of flavor.
[63.26s -> 64.26s]  Where's the rabbit?
[64.26s -> 65.26s]  Give me that.
[65.26s -> 67.26s]  No, there's a rabbit over here. Stop it.
[67.26s -> 69.26s]  I'll bite your face. I'll bite your face off.
[69.26s -> 70.26s]  Let's go back inside.
[70.26s -> 72.26s]  Okay, let's go inside and eat some more cookies.
[72.26s -> 78.40s]  Oh no, the cookies are all gone. Someone stole the cookies.
[78.40s -> 80.77s]  Who would do such a thing?
[80.77s -> 85.77s]  We need to find out who did it. Which one of these dogs took the cookies?
[85.77s -> 94.77s]  Let's see, are the cookies in here? Are they in the kitchen? Where are they? Who took them?
[94.77s -> 100.76s]  What about outside? Did somebody bring the cookies outside? Who did this?
[100.76s -> 106.13s]  Okay, I don't want to alarm anybody here, but I'm sorry I may have taken a shit in your house.
[106.13s -> 117.60s]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Frank O'Leary.
[117.60s -> 124.60s]  I am the director and producer of The Great Cookie Mystery, Otto's Big Adventure 2.
[124.60s -> 129.60s]  I'm joined here for the director commentary. Thank you for joining us with Otto the dog.
[129.60s -> 130.60s]  Hi.
[130.60s -> 132.60s]  Otto, thank you for joining us.
[132.60s -> 134.60s]  I like cookies. I eat the cookies.
[134.60s -> 136.60s]  Yes, of course.
[136.60s -> 146.60s]  This is going to be the commentary of the piece and why certain things were done, a couple of funny stories and that sort of thing.
[146.60s -> 155.60s]  So we'll start by saying that when I got the script from Burger Boy, it was an absolute masterpiece.
[155.60s -> 165.97s]  I wanted to change a few different things, but the studio wasn't really on the same page with the creative team, which I was leading.
[165.97s -> 166.97s]  I was in this movie.
[166.97s -> 168.53s]  Yeah.
[168.53s -> 171.53s]  I was in this movie. Do you remember how I was in this movie?
[171.53s -> 187.46s]  OK, so what we were trying to achieve from the yin and the yang perspective of this movie was to show the real struggle of the everyday man and make a metaphor towards the beginning of a new life.
[187.46s -> 192.46s]  And that's one of the most important things as a visionary creator that I like.
[192.46s -> 194.70s]  I was in the movie. That's me.
[194.70s -> 197.70s]  Yes, you were in the movie and you did a fantastic job.
[197.70s -> 198.70s]  Yes, thank you.
[198.70s -> 206.70s]  As the lead man behind the mask, which is exactly what I was trying to do with this piece.
[206.70s -> 208.70s]  And that's the end of the film.
[208.70s -> 218.70s]  So thank you, everybody, for watching my magnum opus, Otto's Big Adventure 2, The Great Cookie Mystery.
