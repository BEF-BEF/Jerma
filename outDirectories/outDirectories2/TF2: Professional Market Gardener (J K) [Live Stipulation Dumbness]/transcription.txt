[0.31s -> 17.81s]  Hey, what's going on guys? Jerma here with a market garden rocket jumper gameplay. Now this is going to have some fantastic jumps and fantastic kills.
[17.81s -> 22.96s]  No, no guys, no.
[22.96s -> 27.14s]  Ooh, you ready to see me do some sick market garden skills?
[27.14s -> 31.44s]  Dude, I'm ready to see you go across the map in the sky and duck down with a shovel.
[31.44s -> 35.34s]  This is it. That didn't work.
[35.34s -> 41.74s]  I landed on his head. What? You get penned.
[41.74s -> 45.52s]  How the fuck do you do this?
[46.95s -> 49.95s]  Some timing. Are you kidding me?
[49.95s -> 58.98s]  Oh my God. I would have had that guy. That guy in the sky. You nearly met him.
[58.98s -> 63.66s]  Oh, are you going?
[63.66s -> 66.66s]  Nobody can hit me. Oh shit.
[66.66s -> 70.38s]  I actually did get someone.
[70.38s -> 79.20s]  All right. So one time I saw Star jump from the very beginning of this point all the way to like the other end of spawn.
[79.20s -> 82.20s]  So I'm going to try to do it right now. You guys ready? Here we go.
[82.20s -> 85.20s]  You ready, boo? First attempt. Yeah, I'm ready.
[85.20s -> 88.20s]  I'm waiting at the other end for you. I got it.
[88.20s -> 98.34s]  I'm going. I got this. I'm doing all right. I'm doing good. I've got it. I'm almost there.
[98.34s -> 105.39s]  Let's aim for 13. Oh, does that count? Does that count as a market garden kill?
[105.39s -> 109.53s]  Does it count if I didn't jump in the air? Check this out motherfucker.
[109.53s -> 113.47s]  Here we go, baby. Star underscore niche.
[113.47s -> 124.95s]  It's me. You're sick, dude. Boo, help. I'm stuck.
[124.95s -> 127.95s]  Well, you can get up there. That's not a spy. I just didn't bump into him.
[127.95s -> 130.95s]  We're going to go all the way around. We're going to try to get shot in the back.
[130.95s -> 136.32s]  There's a scout with a pen. No, I'm scared.
[136.32s -> 142.59s]  No, Jimmy. I'm all by myself.
[142.59s -> 149.54s]  What am I doing? I was trying to like rocket jump across the ledge and I like missed the lip.
[149.54s -> 155.71s]  If there's one thing that does be an uber, it's definitely enhanced gravity at a bottomless pit.
[155.71s -> 162.42s]  They can definitely kill an uber. Come on, push it down that little cliff.
[162.42s -> 167.43s]  Push it down. Come on, use all your strength and get it down.
[167.43s -> 175.11s]  Here we go. Here we go. Spy.
[175.11s -> 180.05s]  It's not working in here.
[180.05s -> 183.05s]  I can't. Joan, stay right there. Don't move.
[183.05s -> 195.78s]  Dude, this guy has no idea and I can't even like...
[195.78s -> 201.14s]  Here we go.
[201.14s -> 204.14s]  What? Would you? Would you? Huh?
[204.14s -> 208.97s]  What? What happened to me?
[208.97s -> 215.09s]  Oh, fall damage. Oh.
[215.09s -> 221.83s]  Oh, oh, oh.
[221.83s -> 223.83s]  I didn't even... I forgot to shoot the rocket.
[223.83s -> 225.78s]  I'll distract him.
[225.78s -> 227.78s]  What the hell is this guy doing?
[227.78s -> 230.78s]  Don't kill him. Don't kill him. No.
[230.78s -> 237.09s]  I wanted to crit him for a tickle.
[237.09s -> 240.09s]  I wanted to crit him and he would be like a still target.
[240.09s -> 242.52s]  Like standing still for me.
[242.52s -> 245.14s]  I just did like a full moonsault.
[245.14s -> 249.54s]  Have you ever seen... you know like WWF, the moonsault?
[249.54s -> 252.54s]  Oh, you mean like a full on like Jeff Hardy.
[252.54s -> 257.99s]  Yeah, I just Jeff Hardy moonsaulted off the top turnbuckle onto somebody.
[257.99s -> 262.45s]  I want to get this guy to peek his head over and me to get him.
[262.45s -> 265.71s]  I keep forgetting to shoot the rocket.
[265.71s -> 269.78s]  This guy doesn't know. This guy doesn't know. Let's see if I can do it.
[269.78s -> 275.03s]  What the fuck, man?
[275.03s -> 279.78s]  If I landed, if I registered a hit, I would have killed that engineer.
[279.78s -> 283.43s]  But I'm just awful.
[283.43s -> 284.43s]  Oh, I think I got him.
[284.43s -> 286.80s]  Yeah, you did. There's still a teleporter though.
[286.80s -> 288.80s]  Okay. No, I died.
[288.80s -> 291.10s]  There we go. It's done.
[291.10s -> 292.10s]  I got it.
[292.10s -> 294.10s]  I thought it was like a lot of action in there.
[294.10s -> 296.10s]  You're just like in there with like a shovel.
[296.10s -> 300.38s]  Come on, get back over here.
[300.38s -> 302.38s]  Oh, Gemma, you're in a tight spot.
[302.38s -> 303.68s]  I know, I'm out.
[303.68s -> 305.75s]  Jump away.
[305.75s -> 310.54s]  It could happen here though.
[310.54s -> 319.69s]  I'm going to try to go back to the spawn area.
[319.69s -> 321.69s]  Oh, yes.
[321.69s -> 324.25s]  Yeah, attaboy.
[324.25s -> 329.22s]  Oh, let's do it again.
[329.22s -> 331.22s]  I did it. Three.
[331.22s -> 335.22s]  Three rocket jumping, rocket garden kills.
[336.22s -> 338.22s]  Thank you. Thank you so much.
[338.22s -> 340.22s]  It only took me like an hour and 15 minutes.
[340.22s -> 342.22s]  It's the magic of editing.
[342.22s -> 344.22s]  It's only been like five minutes, whatever it's been, you know?
[344.22s -> 350.80s]  Sup, Spy?
[350.80s -> 352.80s]  You're not going to get away with this one.
[352.80s -> 354.98s]  And it didn't register.
[354.98s -> 358.05s]  And it didn't register.
[358.05s -> 360.05s]  I'm being such a piece of dog crap right now.
[360.05s -> 362.05s]  Like I cannot kill this Spy.
[362.05s -> 364.86s]  And he's like killing people on our team too.
[364.86s -> 369.41s]  Heavy?
[369.41s -> 372.54s]  Dude, I'm bumping into Spies everywhere.
[372.54s -> 376.60s]  Heavy?
[376.60s -> 378.60s]  These guys are snipers all over the map.
[378.60s -> 380.60s]  How am I nervous?
[383.61s -> 385.61s]  That guy was so confused.
