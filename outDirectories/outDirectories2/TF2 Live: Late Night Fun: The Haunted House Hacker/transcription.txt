[0.31s -> 18.26s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma and MLC Stealth here with a late night live commentary.
[18.26s -> 26.26s]  Nice. You gotta be cool. You're even like in the call. Oh god, I forgot I equipped this.
[26.26s -> 33.14s]  I'm already trying so hard, I become silent. Why did I go after him with that? That was a mistake.
[33.14s -> 46.94s]  This is a spy. Get out of my face. No, he's not there. But anyway, this is a late night live commentary.
[46.94s -> 53.11s]  Haven't done a commentary like this in a long time.
[53.11s -> 58.67s]  He was so WM1 that he didn't even know what to do when the edge came about him.
[58.67s -> 66.04s]  When was the last time I did do a live commentary besides the live streaming stuff? I can't even remember.
[66.04s -> 76.84s]  But here it is. Oh, well, you are a spy. I think he's still alive. Maybe.
[76.84s -> 86.74s]  And get... Yeah, I got you. What just happened? Did that guy just blow himself up?
[86.74s -> 93.65s]  There seems to be a lot of people who are doing that this game. Come on, take another one of those.
[93.65s -> 101.46s]  I can't hit this guy. Oh my god, I just barely missed him. What is...
[101.46s -> 107.89s]  You know, it's been so long since I've used the flare gun. I equipped it to like change things up and I haven't even... Yeah, that's a spy.
[107.89s -> 115.14s]  What are you playing as? Pyro. I gotta get my flare gun shots down.
[115.14s -> 121.45s]  We've been playing Shoe Mania Storm for years. Come on. For years.
[121.45s -> 132.46s]  Oh, that's gonna make people angry. I just shot a rocket into the spawn.
[132.46s -> 138.78s]  Oh look, it's Wheatley. Here we go. Here's Dean Pelton. What's he got? He's got the knife, the ambassador.
[138.78s -> 146.48s]  Oh, you're watching me? I'll watch this like spawn kill. Are you really just like spawn killing people?
[146.48s -> 151.48s]  Kinda. It's not like on purpose though. And I did face stab a heavy just now.
[151.48s -> 155.68s]  Yeah, I'm spawning. Oh my god. Yeah, right.
[155.68s -> 163.57s]  Oh, I just got a crit-rocketed in the face. I was gonna reflect it too, I just got too close to him.
[163.57s -> 172.51s]  Where am I on this scoreboard? It's pretty awful right now. I'm doing pretty good.
[172.51s -> 184.63s]  I just heard somebody scream. What? How did this guy get back here? My goodness.
[184.63s -> 194.40s]  And scout! Get hit. No. Why did I do that? Man, Blue Team is just not doing this right now.
[194.40s -> 203.97s]  I think maybe we should switch to the other team. Let's tell Black Wholesun and ReverseCowgirl133 to go on...
[203.97s -> 212.15s]  Oh my god, so many people just came up here. The entire Blue Team just came up the stairs.
[212.15s -> 222.62s]  So many people were just right there. It's almost like all of them were talking over Skype to come and get me.
[223.62s -> 225.62s]  I dare you, get that Pyro.
[236.18s -> 243.60s]  That guy's emblem is the community flag for the school of the TV show. He's my new favorite person.
[243.60s -> 249.66s]  I was just about to hate him for killing me, but you can't hate that. He deserves it.
[249.66s -> 252.66s]  And my name is Dean Pelton! How great is that?
[252.66s -> 255.66s]  He probably likes you right now. He loves the references.
[255.66s -> 261.37s]  I'm not sure what to do. I think we got it. Oh god, Sniper.
[261.37s -> 263.74s]  Let's go Blue. Can you get on Blue?
[263.74s -> 268.51s]  I'm not sure what to do. Love your emblem, says Dean Pelton.
[268.51s -> 271.75s]  Oh, it's too late. Can't. We're going to have to be against each other now.
[271.75s -> 274.75s]  I'm going to destroy you and burp at the same time.
[274.75s -> 281.94s]  Not even high enough. Rain needles down!
[281.94s -> 292.41s]  Are those even making it across? I think so. Maybe not.
[292.41s -> 295.41s]  Oh buddy, you have no idea what's in store for you!
[295.41s -> 305.31s]  I really need to put on the crit screen if I'm going to do this. I will put that on after.
[305.31s -> 309.64s]  Oh, come on now, you damn woman.
[309.64s -> 314.57s]  Kill me. Thanks, ma'am.
[314.57s -> 317.87s]  Come on, how does nobody die from that? How does nobody die from that?
[317.87s -> 325.02s]  Barrage of needles that went in his face.
[325.02s -> 330.54s]  I'm doing it again. Oh, he's building a sentry. Is that you building that sentry?
[330.54s -> 335.81s]  I am on spy. So nope.
[335.81s -> 339.62s]  One more hit, this guy's dead. He knows it too.
[339.62s -> 343.78s]  Oh, that was lucky.
[343.78s -> 349.71s]  Alright, I gotta turn the crit screen on. I gotta put the crit screen on.
[349.71s -> 352.40s]  Let's push this up.
[352.40s -> 356.64s]  Stay on this point, boys. Heals for everybody, heals for all.
[356.64s -> 362.68s]  And that's when I make my exit. Stay on there. Nice.
[362.68s -> 365.50s]  Is he going to get it? I hope so.
[365.50s -> 369.12s]  It's probably a bad idea that we're facing each other.
[369.12s -> 375.64s]  I'm going battle medic, man. What? What the hell was that?
[375.64s -> 381.73s]  Oh man. My god, a lot of chaos here.
[381.73s -> 385.42s]  Oh, that was lucky and close. I need the health that's up here.
[385.42s -> 388.62s]  Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
[388.62s -> 392.30s]  Alright, is that guy's name Andariel?
[392.30s -> 396.86s]  Oh, what? Oh, random crits. Those confuse me right now.
[396.86s -> 400.86s]  Let's go down here. Let's go down here, buddy.
[400.86s -> 406.18s]  Oh, look out. Kill that heavy. Kill that heavy?
[406.18s -> 416.70s]  I gotta keep this thing on him. Now he needs it.
[416.70s -> 422.65s]  Alright, so I see a spy in my team. He's just crouch walking around with his thing.
[422.65s -> 428.86s]  I wish you could have seen what just happened here.
[428.86s -> 432.35s]  I wish you could have seen what just happened here.
[432.35s -> 438.01s]  He's going to know I'm right here. See if I can't.
[438.01s -> 440.01s]  Oh, I thought I could have killed him. How much health?
[440.01s -> 447.24s]  Oh, no way.
[447.24s -> 450.24s]  Oh my gosh, that guy's lagging. Geez.
[450.24s -> 454.18s]  I hear a roar across the whole stadium right now. What's happening?
[454.18s -> 458.10s]  I don't hear anything.
[458.10s -> 461.77s]  It sounds like I'm in a haunted mansion right now.
[461.77s -> 464.77s]  Wait, what? Oh my god, it's a speed hacker.
[464.77s -> 466.20s]  What?
[466.20s -> 474.14s]  It's a hacker. It's a speed hacker. It's a speed hacker.
[474.14s -> 481.36s]  It's a guy with scream hacks, speed hacks.
[481.36s -> 493.01s]  Oh my god. That scared me so much.
[493.01s -> 496.01s]  Dude, what's with the screaming?
[496.01s -> 499.01s]  I thought I was in a haunted mansion.
[499.01s -> 501.01s]  No, don't open the door.
[501.01s -> 503.01s]  I just thought everyone was dying.
[503.01s -> 507.50s]  Oh, you bastards. Don't open that door.
[507.50s -> 510.68s]  Dude, he is going. Look at him. Where is he?
[510.68s -> 513.68s]  Oh my god, dude.
[513.68s -> 519.29s]  I'm just going to go. I'm holding the dead ringer out.
[519.29s -> 521.29s]  I'm so afraid of that noise.
[521.29s -> 525.54s]  Where is he?
[525.54s -> 528.71s]  Psycho.
[528.71s -> 533.98s]  Oh my god. Oh my god. Holy crap.
[533.98s -> 537.41s]  Oh, that's terrifying. Can you hear this?
[537.41s -> 541.58s]  Is he gone? Yeah, I can hear it.
[541.58s -> 546.58s]  Oh, man. Well, so much for the live commentary.
[546.58s -> 549.76s]  What are you talking about? We got it.
[549.76s -> 553.26s]  I know. Look at this.
[553.26s -> 556.26s]  Oh my gosh. I'm going to have a nightmare of this sound.
[556.26s -> 561.16s]  He's just following me around.
[561.16s -> 563.16s]  Oh, I'm dizzy right now.
[563.16s -> 568.66s]  Hold on a second. I need to go spectate. I need to watch this guy.
[568.66s -> 571.66s]  Why does it say everyone's changing their name to Dean Pilton?
[571.66s -> 573.66s]  They clearly are not.
[573.66s -> 575.66s]  That's him. Where is he? Here he is.
[575.66s -> 579.90s]  Look at this guy. Look at this guy's totally legit game he's doing right now.
[579.90s -> 583.39s]  Anyone he runs into, he changes his name to them.
[583.39s -> 588.98s]  This is ridiculous.
[588.98s -> 594.47s]  I'm spectating him right now, and it seriously is one of the oddest things I've ever seen.
[594.47s -> 598.12s]  Yep, here I come.
[598.12s -> 600.12s]  What's his name?
[600.12s -> 603.12s]  His name changes every two seconds.
[603.12s -> 605.49s]  This is hurting my head.
[605.49s -> 608.73s]  I know. I have to... I disconnected.
[608.73s -> 611.73s]  I couldn't take the screams in my head anymore.
[611.73s -> 615.54s]  That's scary. That's a scary sound.
[615.54s -> 617.78s]  That really is.
[617.78s -> 621.75s]  Oh my gosh.
[621.75s -> 624.63s]  Well...
[624.63s -> 628.19s]  Alright, so apparently I wasn't going crazy when I said,
[628.19s -> 633.19s]  Hey, why am I afraid right now in a haunted house?
[633.19s -> 637.46s]  What are you talking about? Oh my gosh.
[637.46s -> 640.70s]  Thanks everybody for watching.
[640.70s -> 643.32s]  I do appreciate it.
[643.32s -> 646.93s]  Yeah, hacks are not cool.
[646.93s -> 651.06s]  So I guess we'll talk to you guys soon.
[651.06s -> 653.06s]  Take it easy everybody.
[653.06s -> 656.06s]  I just said take it easy everybody.
[656.06s -> 659.06s]  Take care everybody. See you all soon.
