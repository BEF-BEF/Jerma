[0.31s -> 14.15s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with an outdoor vlog. I've never done one
[14.15s -> 19.17s]  of these before, but look, you want to see? I'm really outside. I know, right? It's crazy.
[19.17s -> 25.20s]  A nerd like me going outside. Yeah, right. But I wanted to make this video because obviously
[25.20s -> 29.76s]  it's beautiful outside. It's kind of late, but it was beautiful outside earlier. But
[29.76s -> 33.30s]  I wanted to make this video to give a couple of updates on certain things because I get
[33.30s -> 39.74s]  asked these questions a lot of times. So, Grandpa. Grandpa is coming back to Machinima
[39.74s -> 47.20s]  Respawn next month. There's going to be a trailer for Grandpa next week, I think, for
[47.20s -> 51.48s]  season two. So if you're wondering, Jerma, where did Grandpa go? How come there's been
[51.48s -> 57.70s]  no Grandpa for like five weeks on Machinima Respawn? It's because it was taken into an
[57.70s -> 63.38s]  off season and it's coming back. Don't worry. So, May, look for Grandpa. Oh my God, a bug
[63.38s -> 70.99s]  just landed on me. Bug bastards. So look for Grandpa in May on Machinima Respawn. And I'm
[70.99s -> 75.37s]  working on it right now. It's going to be ridiculous. So the second thing is a lot of
[75.37s -> 78.73s]  wind right now. Hopefully it's not ruining this entire footage. But the second thing
[78.73s -> 86.21s]  is going to be about my server, my Team Fortress 2 server. And I bought it. It's all set up.
[86.21s -> 92.51s]  It's all ready to go. But I want to talk to somebody that knows about servers. I have
[92.53s -> 99.05s]  an appointment with Shibby2142. He knows what he's talking about. So before I make the server
[99.05s -> 104.41s]  public and the server live and all that stuff, I want to make sure it's good to go and I
[104.41s -> 109.49s]  have all the settings as good as I can possibly have them. So stay tuned. I'll make another
[109.49s -> 115.42s]  video. I'll mention it in another video. But yes, the server is coming along one week from
[115.42s -> 123.06s]  today. It should be live. That's my prediction. Otto, what are you doing? My dog is running
[123.08s -> 127.81s]  around in circles around the yard. And speaking of Otto, I don't know if you can hear that,
[127.81s -> 132.99s]  but speaking of Otto, a lot of people have asked this. They want to see more Otto. If
[132.99s -> 139.99s]  you don't know, Otto is my little dog, my little Doxen Doberman Chihuahua thing that
[140.71s -> 145.11s]  I got like a month ago. And I showed him in one video and that was all it took. Everyone
[145.11s -> 152.36s]  loves Otto. They want to see him. So okay, here you go. Oh God, he's coming to get me.
[152.36s -> 164.39s]  Come on. What do you got? What do you got? That's my shoe. You are a freak. Look at
[165.81s -> 173.31s]  that face. Oh my God. What? Oh, I'm going to pick up this stick that's like 10 times
[173.31s -> 182.33s]  bigger than my body. This is actually going to work. What an idiot. Hey, don't eat that.
[182.33s -> 186.93s]  So thank you all so much for watching. I really do. It's cold out. My lips are like all numb.
[186.93s -> 191.81s]  So like talking is like, but thank you guys so much for watching. I really do appreciate
[191.81s -> 198.81s]  it. And I will see you guys all next time. So peace, love, and take care everybody. Otto!
