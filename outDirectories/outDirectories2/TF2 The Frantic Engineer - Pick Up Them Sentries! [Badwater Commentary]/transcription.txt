[0.31s -> 20.95s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here, with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm gonna be playing as the Engineer with this stuff that's on the screen, that stuff right there.
[20.95s -> 29.95s]  Pretty self-explanatory, pretty default setup for the Engineer, except for the Southern hospitality. I usually have either the Jag or my strange bot killer baby.
[29.95s -> 38.95s]  But anyways, this video is gonna talk about the gameplay, and I haven't done that in a long time, an actual serious gameplay talk, and it's gonna discuss a certain style of Engineer.
[38.95s -> 47.26s]  And I wouldn't even really call this a style of Engineer as much as it is almost a necessity nowadays when you're playing Team Fortress 2.
[47.26s -> 52.26s]  And I'll get into this, I'll talk about what I mean here, but it's called the Frantic Engineer.
[53.26s -> 66.26s]  Now, a lot of us, when we first start playing the game, or even when playing the game for a couple of years, we will pick up the Engineer, and we think it's, oh yeah, just like, put down the Sentry, and just like, King, King, I got you, is that leveled up yet?
[66.26s -> 79.26s]  Okay, it is. Let me like, walk slowly over it. That's what we do. The Engineer is a weird class where a lot of people are afraid to play it, because they don't want to put a Sentry in the wrong spot, or they think it's boring,
[79.26s -> 88.26s]  and I don't want to screw something up because it's a very big part of the defense, but in actuality, the Engineer can be a very high adrenaline class.
[88.26s -> 99.26s]  When I play Engineer, as you're watching on the screen, just the carnage and the chaos that's happening around me, and trying to keep things under control, I have the same adrenaline rush when I play Engineer,
[99.26s -> 108.43s]  then I have when I play Scout, like when I'm running around Scout, like getting good shots, meat shot, meat shot, I've got like two or three kills in a row, that same mentality I go through as the Engineer.
[108.43s -> 116.43s]  So if you play the Engineer with the same type of veracity that you play the Scout, you will do a lot better, and you'll have a lot more fun.
[116.43s -> 127.06s]  And you probably noticed maybe 15 or 20 seconds ago, I picked up the Sentry during a very, very heated situation, and I feel like I don't see a lot of Engineers do this,
[127.06s -> 137.06s]  and it's very, very important as follows. We all know that a moving target in this game is a lot more difficult to hit than a standing still target.
[137.06s -> 143.06s]  I mean, it makes complete sense, right? Things that stand still die quicker than things that are moving around, and people have to aim at them.
[143.06s -> 147.06s]  So when you pick up that Sentry, what you're effectively doing is saying,
[147.06s -> 154.06s]  Demoman, you've got to kill me now, and not the Sentry. You would have killed the Sentry anyways, and I would have had to rebuild it,
[154.06s -> 160.06s]  but I'm willing to go down with the damn ship if you can manage to kill me, and I do it a couple times in this video.
[160.06s -> 168.06s]  And where the Sentry would have died, it just doesn't, and it works especially well when you're in a tight corner like this,
[168.06s -> 172.06s]  because somebody has to come down here to take this Sentry out.
[172.06s -> 179.06s]  Now, some Demoman is going to be lobbing stickies across the whole map, which, I mean, effectively, he could probably do that,
[179.06s -> 185.06s]  but a good rule of thumb is, if you see one sticky land next to your Sentry gun, pick it up immediately,
[185.06s -> 188.06s]  and just start kind of backing up and just, you know, surveying the situation.
[188.06s -> 194.06s]  If an Uber Demoman comes in, you're dead anyways, and so is the Sentry, almost guaranteed.
[194.06s -> 201.06s]  So to give yourself any sort of chance to have that potentially not happen is in your best interest as an Engineer.
[201.06s -> 207.06s]  And if you notice, another thing I want to talk about, I don't stop moving almost this entire gameplay.
[207.06s -> 211.06s]  I'm whipping around, I'm checking, I'm hitting, I'm checking, I'm hitting, I'm checking.
[211.06s -> 219.06s]  You always want to be moving as an Engineer, because the more you stand still, the easier you are for a Sniper to kill you and a Spy.
[219.06s -> 223.06s]  Those are your two, like, biggest threats, I guess you could say, besides a Demoman that's Ubered.
[223.06s -> 229.06s]  But, Snipers, I can't tell you how many times I've seen an Engineer building his Sentry gun, standing completely still,
[229.06s -> 234.06s]  and he just gets smoked by a Sniper, and then his Sentry goes down because he's not there repairing it.
[234.06s -> 242.36s]  Another good rule of thumb for this particular tip, I guess, is if it's been more than five seconds and you haven't looked behind you,
[242.36s -> 249.60s]  look behind you. There you go. If you can count to five and you've been facing the same direction, you're dead.
[249.60s -> 251.60s]  Like, turn around and look behind you, because there's probably a Spy.
[252.60s -> 256.60s]  Look, did you see how many Spies have come down here during this one video?
[256.60s -> 263.60s]  Is evidence enough to always be checking behind you or to your side if you're in a good spot like I am in the corner here?
[263.60s -> 272.03s]  And to kind of wrap this up, I mentioned in the beginning of this video why this is a necessity now to play Engineer like this in any class.
[272.03s -> 280.03s]  People have gotten a lot better at this game than they were back in, like, 2007, 2008, 2009.
[280.03s -> 285.03s]  There's a lot more players because of the free-to-play update, and people are just really good now.
[285.03s -> 289.03s]  That's something that I was talking to, I think it was Star the other day, and I was saying,
[289.03s -> 292.34s]  man, there are so many people that are just really good at this game now.
[292.34s -> 295.34s]  It's like people know what they're doing now.
[295.34s -> 300.34s]  You don't run into as many Spies that are just backstabbing the spawn door anymore.
[300.34s -> 305.34s]  Like, that's not as big of a thing as it was back, like, 12 months ago.
[305.34s -> 311.70s]  So you really got to be on your toes in this stage of the TF2 game, because no matter what server you play on,
[311.70s -> 316.70s]  they will always be that guy that's on the other team that's really good as sniper,
[316.70s -> 322.70s]  and he's just sitting there tracking your bald-ass cue ball heavy head, and you die every single time.
[322.70s -> 326.70s]  So you really have to start to adapt to the circumstances, adapt to the game,
[326.70s -> 329.70s]  and I think that's what a lot of people have been doing over the years.
[329.70s -> 334.70s]  And as the game's been out for so long, years and years and years go by, people just are getting better,
[334.70s -> 337.70s]  and people are just good. That's the way it really is.
[337.70s -> 339.94s]  But that is going to wrap up this video, guys.
[339.94s -> 342.94s]  Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[342.94s -> 345.94s]  And if you have anything to add in the comments section, I'd love to read it.
[345.94s -> 349.94s]  Please, by all means, type away, but I'll see you guys all next time.
[349.94s -> 353.89s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
