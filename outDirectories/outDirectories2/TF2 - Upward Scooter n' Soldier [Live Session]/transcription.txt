[0.18s -> 12.14s]  Hey, what's going on, everybody? Jerma here with a live Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[12.14s -> 17.19s]  Tonight I'm going to be playing as the squirrel, and let's just play.
[17.19s -> 27.73s]  There we go. Whoa! Don't scare me like that, man. Don't scare me like that.
[27.73s -> 33.50s]  Let me try and get around everybody. That's all I want to do.
[33.50s -> 41.71s]  You think I'm still in here? No, I ran away. Probably a sentry right here. I would be shocked if there wasn't.
[41.71s -> 52.35s]  I would be shocked. No, no, no, no, no! Don't get stuck in the door!
[52.35s -> 59.75s]  Sentry? I don't know. I don't think so. I'm just gonna do it just to be careful.
[59.75s -> 67.05s]  No, there isn't. Okay. Well, don't be spotted. Maybe I can get like three scout backstabs here.
[67.05s -> 79.44s]  Well, that was kind of. Sort of. Sort of. I'm gonna go with sort of. I'm gonna go with maybe.
[79.44s -> 88.53s]  What is this guy doing? Uh-oh, we got a fight. We got a melee fight. Who's gonna win the melee fight? Soldier or Spy?
[88.53s -> 94.42s]  Soldier or Spy? Oh! I turned right into that.
[94.42s -> 99.78s]  I was too busy paying attention to the fucking pay-per-view Soldier versus Spy match.
[99.78s -> 106.90s]  It only cost me like 60 bucks pay-per-view to see that. Was it worth it? Bet your ass it was.
[106.90s -> 115.01s]  Move on. You, I thought you were a Spy, but you weren't.
[116.18s -> 118.62s]  Drink it!
[118.62s -> 129.14s]  That's a great screen. Huh? Are we gonna win? I think.
[129.14s -> 137.95s]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have won the game. Not yet. Almost. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[137.95s -> 140.51s]  Here comes your scramble!
[140.51s -> 148.78s]  Hmm, you know, I guess. Are you guys all real? You're all real. Then fine.
[148.78s -> 155.61s]  It's all right. We're just gonna play on the red team and your red scout on the red team.
[155.61s -> 159.91s]  This sniper is trying to shoot me. Don't shoot me.
[159.91s -> 166.57s]  Time to be a creep and creep up behind this sniper.
[166.57s -> 177.58s]  All right, I'll walk in his face. That works too. And this scout, you think you can beat a red scout on a red team?
[177.58s -> 182.91s]  You get away. Everybody, I made it out alive.
[182.91s -> 188.67s]  Fucking Mini-Sentry almost kills me.
[188.67s -> 192.88s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[196.76s -> 201.90s]  Where is he? God, I don't know how I'm staying alive like this.
[201.90s -> 209.13s]  Hmm, I can't really go head on here.
[209.13s -> 214.94s]  I can't really do much. I have to wait till they move or I could just go right at them.
[214.94s -> 227.23s]  There we go. Now I can overheal. Now I'm not as scared as I just was.
[227.23s -> 236.14s]  There it is. What? They can't. Oh, okay. All right. Okay.
[236.14s -> 243.22s]  Son of a bitch. I thought I had that guy, but I didn't.
[243.22s -> 249.75s]  Move away. Um, all righty.
[249.75s -> 254.12s]  Just stop them here for 10 minutes. Ain't gonna be that long.
[254.12s -> 264.18s]  I keep on just barely not getting the last Mini-Sentry again.
[264.18s -> 273.29s]  Please don't kill me. One.
[273.29s -> 280.12s]  Okay. All right. We'll just respawn. We'll do it all over again.
[280.12s -> 288.66s]  And we'll just spawn right now. I'll come out with my delicious soda.
[288.66s -> 294.02s]  I'm not going to drink it. I want to save it because I'm going to a movie later and I want to have a soda for the movie.
[294.02s -> 299.90s]  But you can't bring like sodas into the movie. Otherwise they get like mad at you.
[299.90s -> 306.88s]  All right. Well, it doesn't matter. I'm not having a soda for the fucking movie.
[306.88s -> 310.88s]  Hey, hi entire team. Don't like turn around.
