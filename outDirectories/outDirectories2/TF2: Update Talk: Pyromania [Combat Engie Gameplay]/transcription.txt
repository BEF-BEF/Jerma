[0.57s -> 14.84s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary,
[14.84s -> 20.48s]  and tonight we're gonna be playing as the Engineer with the Widowmaker, the Mini-Sentry
[20.48s -> 26.20s]  Gunslinger, and the Pistol. It's gonna be on Barn Blitz defense on the last point, but
[26.20s -> 31.08s]  we are not gonna talk about the gameplay. We're gonna talk about the update stuff and how
[31.08s -> 36.91s]  tomorrow, Wednesday, meet the Pyros coming out and we got a bunch of new stuff, a bunch
[36.99s -> 41.51s]  of new items, some new sets. My brain is wracked right now. I cannot wait to talk about this.
[41.51s -> 46.71s]  Now, how I typically do my update videos, guys, is I wait till it's all out. Wait till
[46.71s -> 51.11s]  I can actually get my hands on this stuff before I give, obviously, my demonstrations
[51.11s -> 55.83s]  and my first opinions on them and stuff like that. So that video will be out tomorrow.
[55.83s -> 59.39s]  The second I can get my hands on all these items and make a video, it will be live on
[59.39s -> 66.32s]  this channel. But in the meantime, let's talk about what we've seen so far. So Monday, they
[66.32s -> 72.46s]  showed us, in my opinion, the best part about this entire update. We're getting a new official
[72.46s -> 79.00s]  game mode to Team Fortress 2. The last official game mode was DeGroot Keep, and a lot of people
[79.00s -> 83.64s]  don't even consider that a game mode. And we've gotten stuff like Saxon Hail. We've
[83.64s -> 88.34s]  gotten stuff like Prop Hunt and WarioWare. Those are all great community mods, but we
[88.34s -> 93.10s]  haven't seen an official one in so long. So this is just so exciting to me. I can't wait
[93.10s -> 97.58s]  to play this. Can't wait to try it. I have no idea how the game mode works. But the way
[97.58s -> 102.18s]  it sounds on the Valve website, it's kind of like Left 4 Dead 2 scavenge mode, where
[102.18s -> 106.62s]  you had one team had to fill up a tank and the other team had to stop them from doing
[106.62s -> 110.90s]  that. And if the first team fills the tank up and the rocket takes off, then they win
[110.90s -> 115.46s]  the game and then they flip a course sides and vice versa. So I think that's kind of
[115.46s -> 120.34s]  how it's going to work. Maybe red team is defense or maybe not. Maybe it's you're both
[120.66s -> 124.22s]  fighting for the same rocket, blue team and red team. That would be pretty interesting.
[124.22s -> 127.82s]  You know, you have a bar on the top that goes back and forth depending on how much fuel
[127.82s -> 132.76s]  the certain side is put in. This is all speculation at this point because I have no idea. But
[132.76s -> 138.70s]  I do know one thing. It's probably going to be a lot of fun. So today, Tuesday, we got
[138.70s -> 143.14s]  a bunch of different items for some of the classes. We got some scout stuff, sniper,
[143.14s -> 147.82s]  soldier and pyro. And I actually really want to talk about the pyro item. I'll go over
[147.82s -> 151.94s]  the stuff obviously tomorrow. I'm going to do a big, huge video on all this stuff. But
[151.94s -> 155.99s]  I want to talk about the pyro item mostly. Link will be in the description for all these
[155.99s -> 161.15s]  items and you can scroll down and see what I'm talking about. This pyro item is a secondary,
[161.15s -> 166.47s]  I think. But the stats on it are very, very odd. So for instance, it's called the scorch
[166.47s -> 172.09s]  shot, right? Flare knocks back target on hit and ignites enemies in a small radius. And
[172.09s -> 177.71s]  there's a minus 50% damage penalty on this thing. So my question is this. If this is
[177.71s -> 183.03s]  a secondary, why would you ever equip this rather than the flare gun or the detonator
[183.03s -> 187.23s]  or the shotgun? Knocking somebody back for a secondary, it's essentially a compression
[187.23s -> 194.17s]  blast. But as a pyro, we use our compression blast to utilize our secondaries. So if I
[194.17s -> 197.77s]  compression blast somebody and then switch to this and shoot them, I'm going to compression
[197.77s -> 201.63s]  blast them twice. I don't think it crits. I'm not sure if it even does any of those
[201.63s -> 207.60s]  things the flare gun does. And the minus 50% damage penalty, I feel like this is a primary.
[207.60s -> 210.92s]  I feel like it should be a primary because I can't think of a use for it if it was a
[210.92s -> 216.36s]  secondary. If it were a primary, think about launching somebody in the air with this, then
[216.36s -> 220.64s]  switching to something like the reserve shooter or the detonator or the flare gun and getting
[220.64s -> 224.32s]  the crit. That would make some sense. That would be interesting, especially because of
[224.32s -> 229.88s]  the minus 50% damage. You could essentially turn this into a compression blaster and that's
[229.88s -> 234.04s]  its job and that's what it's used for. But I think I have to stop making all these assumptions
[234.04s -> 238.02s]  on this item before I even sit down and use it. But that's my favorite part about Team
[238.02s -> 242.48s]  Fortress. Sitting down, speculating on items because we don't even know. There could be
[242.48s -> 246.76s]  more stuff tomorrow that complements this item. I don't even know yet. Nobody knows.
[246.76s -> 251.83s]  That's the beauty of Team Fortress. So tomorrow is Wednesday, which is the launch of the update
[251.83s -> 256.41s]  and of course the launch of Meet the Pyro. So here's a little fun facts for you. Meet
[256.41s -> 261.51s]  the Pyro comes out tomorrow. Meet the Medic came out exactly one year ago. And before
[261.55s -> 267.31s]  that, Meet the Spy came out two full years behind Meet the Medic. So it's kind of interesting.
[267.31s -> 271.31s]  They took two years to make Meet the Medic and pretty much less than one to make Meet
[271.31s -> 276.87s]  the Pyro. I remember looking at that coming in 2012 image that's on the main page and
[276.87s -> 281.69s]  I thought to myself, there's no freaking way they're going to introduce Meet the Pyro in
[281.69s -> 285.07s]  the first or second quarter. There's no way. I thought this was going to come out in like
[285.07s -> 291.25s]  November or December, right at the very end of 2012. And I was proven wrong. And that's
[291.25s -> 295.16s]  pretty awesome because I can't wait to see it. So yeah, that's going to wrap up the video
[295.16s -> 299.24s]  guys. Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. And let's see how
[299.24s -> 303.48s]  this update comes through. Let's see how awesome it is. Let's see how cool Meet the Pyro is.
[303.48s -> 306.94s]  I'm sure we're all going to be talking about this tomorrow. There will be a video on this
[306.94s -> 310.92s]  channel tomorrow as well talking about all the items in detail, showing them in gameplay
[310.92s -> 314.77s]  form. Just wanted to make this video telling you how excited I am and I can't wait for
[314.77s -> 318.65s]  Meet the Pyro and I can't wait for these items. But yeah, anyways, I'll see you guys all next
[318.65s -> 321.01s]  time and take care everybody.
