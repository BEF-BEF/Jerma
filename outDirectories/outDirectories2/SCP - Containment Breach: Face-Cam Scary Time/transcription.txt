[0.31s -> 16.73s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? It's Jerma here with SCP Containment Breach, and this is another SCP game.
[16.73s -> 25.42s]  You saw the SCP-087 that I did a while back, well, a few days ago or so. It's the scary stuff we're dealing with, and a lot of people wanted me to play this game.
[25.42s -> 31.85s]  I got a lot of recommendations to play this one, and apparently this one is more fleshed out and has kind of like a story or something.
[31.85s -> 42.09s]  I haven't watched any videos, so I'm not going to ruin anything for myself. All I know is that this is scary. S-H-I-T with an apostrophe. I don't know why there's an apostrophe.
[42.09s -> 52.27s]  But, new game. I'm scared, as you can tell. I'm kind of nervous, and I'm freaking out. So name's going to be Burger Boy, because it always is. Burger Boy D.
[52.27s -> 68.27s]  Normal saving, enable intro sequence. That's fine, I guess. SCP... What the hell is that? Oh, there's actually dudes here with me.
[69.27s -> 73.64s]  What the hell? SCP-173. Uselet Object Class.
[75.39s -> 87.17s]  Why are we getting in here with this thing? Why would I want to walk towards that thing?
[88.17s -> 115.68s]  Oh my god, dude. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god! Am I dead? Did I just die? What? You can die in this game!
[116.68s -> 125.37s]  Are you serious? Can I load that? Wow. Okay, let's go again.
[126.37s -> 141.35s]  So do I run? I must have to just turn around and run. God. Is my dog still in here? My dog is probably like... I didn't even know he was still in here.
[142.35s -> 152.90s]  So that's the scary freak show, dude. Alright, now I'm running, I'm running. I know what's going to happen, I'm running. Can you run? Yep.
[153.90s -> 171.38s]  No, no, no. Get me out of here. Bye. Goodbye. Get me out of here. How do I click? Open it. No, get me out of here. Get me out, get me out, get me out.
[172.38s -> 186.46s]  Why can't I open the door? What's making that noise? I made it. I made it out. He's chasing me! He's probably chasing me! He's probably chasing me. Open the door!
[187.46s -> 191.46s]  Open the door, open the door. Close it. Close the door, close the door, close the door. Oh my god!
[202.43s -> 217.32s]  Dude, what do you think about this boo boo? He's sleepy, he doesn't care. So you just have to run away from a monster, man.
[219.14s -> 226.49s]  No, I don't want to go that way. Um, where do I want to go? Which way do I want to go? Hit this button!
[228.37s -> 233.50s]  I don't know where I am! What's that black smoke? Boo!
[238.50s -> 244.80s]  What happened here? What happened here? I can't go back in? I can't go back in. He's going to be right there.
[245.80s -> 249.60s]  Just run! No, I didn't want to close the door! Open it!
[251.29s -> 256.42s]  Where? I think I made it. I think I finally got away. No, this is where I was before. Is there anything in here?
[257.42s -> 263.77s]  He's right here. If I turn around, he's going to be there.
[266.93s -> 274.16s]  Oh, thank god. Run. Just, I'm going to keep my looking.
[275.34s -> 278.34s]  I've got to go back in here. I think I must have got away from him. I had to a bit.
[279.34s -> 283.50s]  The time switch closes the door automatically. Okay.
[283.50s -> 291.64s]  Okay. So that means I can get in here. Get out of here. What's that? What's that? What's that?
[296.27s -> 302.61s]  Um, left or right? Left or right? Left or right? Left or right? Right. Open.
[304.36s -> 310.82s]  God. Oh my god! What the hell is that thing? What the hell is that thing?
[314.87s -> 322.62s]  Is he going to be still chasing? Is he still going to be there? Lights? I can't, I don't want to move.
[323.79s -> 328.29s]  My hands are off the mouse. What's going on? What is going on? What just happened?
[328.29s -> 337.91s]  What is happening? What the hell is happening right now? I'm like on like crack.
[340.24s -> 345.76s]  No freaking way, dude. No freaking way. I'm all about just running, man.
[346.76s -> 360.50s]  Smoke. It's always smoke. What was that? I see like the smoke. I see him right there. I see like the dude.
[361.50s -> 382.80s]  Oh my god. Wait. Whoa! Why, boo boo? He's here to protect me.
[382.80s -> 396.51s]  See you next time. Take care, everybody. Me and him are going to go eat a coconut ice cream.
