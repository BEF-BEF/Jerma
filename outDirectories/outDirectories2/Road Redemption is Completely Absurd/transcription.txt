[0.76s -> 18.49s]  All right, throttle, handbrake, jump jets, grab rider. All right, so let's go, all right?
[18.49s -> 33.84s]  I guess so. I did not expect that to happen immediately once starting this video. What
[33.84s -> 41.48s]  is happening? Hi, everybody. My name is Jerma. Welcome to Road Redemption. This is a game
[41.96s -> 50.82s]  beat. My game is crashing. Jesus. Okay, hold on a minute. I need a second. I need to like
[50.82s -> 59.34s]  prepare for this. Well, I got like a gun. How do you shoot the gun? How do I shoot this
[59.34s -> 67.02s]  gun at this guy? Oh, well, I took a fucking beam in the face. I want to shoot this guy.
[67.82s -> 81.18s]  Oh dear god. What? What? How does? I thought. Oh, I did. Did I not die? I must not have died
[81.18s -> 88.86s]  from that. Okay. How do you shoot the weapon? I need to figure this out. Is it? There we go.
[88.86s -> 94.28s]  That's how you do it. All right, I figured it out. If I could only hit somebody with it,
[94.28s -> 100.82s]  that would be fantastic. But apparently that's not as easy as it looks. Especially when I'm
[100.82s -> 107.19s]  playing with a controller, which I probably shouldn't be doing. But I am going right here,
[107.19s -> 118.30s]  right here, right here. I'm going to get this guy. No, I got him. I won. I did it. Get out of my face.
[123.96s -> 132.49s]  Can I make, can I like jump over this? I got you. I got you. You let him fuck up. Let's go for a ride.
[132.49s -> 148.58s]  What is happening? How are we still driving? We're not on the course, isn't this?
[169.99s -> 171.67s]  My chest is going to cave in.
[176.17s -> 185.78s]  Oh, I only have 25. Put this down for a second.
[187.42s -> 195.29s]  All right, let's actually try to like win rather than just like throw up from laughing,
[196.33s -> 201.82s]  which is kind of hard to do. All right, I got this. I'm going to actually try to win,
[203.56s -> 214.12s]  not instantly die. This game is hilarious though. Without question. Get out of here.
[215.00s -> 226.04s]  Oh shit. I'll get him. Road rash. Road rage. Hey, what's up buddy? You want to get road raged?
[230.79s -> 234.07s]  You want to get, no shit. I was trying to hit you. I'm trying to hit this guy
[235.19s -> 237.91s]  and then I'm going to hit this guy too. Screw you buddy.
[238.39s -> 252.28s]  How much money have I made? I've made $150. That's good. That's a good amount of money to make for
[252.28s -> 263.74s]  just ramming into this shit. You know, it's a good day to make $150. What the fuck was that?
[264.46s -> 267.66s]  Did you see that? Hold on. I don't even care. I need to go watch it. No.
[269.18s -> 273.16s]  I want to go see the guy riding the car. Please tell me I can get back up.
[273.72s -> 282.39s]  I need to get back up there. Come on. Punch it. Punch it. There we go. That's what I'm talking
[282.39s -> 287.69s]  about. All right, there's no way I'm going to find that guy again. So I might as well just turn.
[289.61s -> 299.08s]  Okay, that was very loud. Apparently. I can drive up here, huh? Can I really drive up here?
[299.08s -> 310.42s]  Okay, I guess so. All right. We're going down the mountain. There's all the crash sounds.
[310.98s -> 314.94s]  Am I even driving the right way? See? There it was again. There it was again.
[315.86s -> 322.89s]  Somebody is riding a car. I need to figure out how to do that. That's really important.
[322.89s -> 348.36s]  If I can figure out how to do that. Okay, can I drive? Shit. Nitro. Nitro is kind of crazy.
[351.86s -> 361.80s]  Just nitro again. Nitro. It's okay. I'm still alive. I can still do this.
[363.02s -> 374.44s]  Let's go, you son of a bitches. Total carnage. Oh, boy. Did you see how much stuff just got
[374.44s -> 389.40s]  crashed? Did you just see? Oh, my God. Seriously. This is like tactical intervention. I'm having
[389.40s -> 405.83s]  more flashbacks. Drive. Drive. So I have to attract cops? I already have like. Oh.
