[3.45s -> 12.23s]  Hey, what is happening guys? It's Jerma here with another gameplay commentary.
[12.23s -> 16.23s]  This time we are the medic as the quick fix medic on gorge.
[16.23s -> 21.23s]  This is not five gorge, this is two gorge as you can see by the two receptacles in the bottom.
[21.23s -> 23.23s]  Is that even a word? I'm not even sure.
[23.23s -> 29.23s]  Anyways, probably should have popped it right there, but I didn't want to waste it because I think there was only one guy up there.
[29.23s -> 33.23s]  I think it was like a soldier or a pyro or something that he was shooting at.
[33.23s -> 36.23s]  Wasn't a sentry, so I figured I'm not going to pop it. I don't want to waste it.
[36.23s -> 43.23s]  I think he actually got killed by a crit rocket and a crit heavy, so probably wouldn't have been able to do anything too much with it anyways,
[43.23s -> 45.23s]  because that uber obviously you don't become invincible.
[45.23s -> 50.23s]  So this is going to prove to you guys right here in a second why this is not just a lame excuse for a medigun.
[50.23s -> 53.23s]  It actually works pretty, pretty well. I'll give you the load up for the match too.
[53.23s -> 56.23s]  It's the quick fix, the blutsauger, and the ubersaw.
[56.23s -> 59.23s]  And right here I popped this heavy and check this out, there's a sentry in here.
[59.23s -> 62.23s]  He can't get knocked in around anyway, he can't get pushed around.
[62.23s -> 66.23s]  This uber is good. I don't know why everyone thinks that this uber is terrible.
[66.23s -> 71.23s]  When I did the uber update video that I did like about a month or two ago, I thought it was stupid.
[71.23s -> 75.23s]  I thought the uber was pathetic, but it is what it is guys. You have to think about it like that.
[75.23s -> 78.23s]  You're going to be able to tank massive amounts of damage.
[78.23s -> 80.23s]  Nobody's going to be able to push you around.
[80.23s -> 87.23s]  So pyros, rockets, anything like that, you will be able to stand firm when you use this, and it's incredibly important that you do that.
[87.23s -> 90.23s]  Think about how many times you've used an uber.
[90.23s -> 93.47s]  And a pyro just comes over and just ruins your day.
[93.47s -> 96.47s]  It happens almost 50% of the time to me.
[96.47s -> 99.47s]  Oh, let's go pop uber. I can't move.
[99.47s -> 101.47s]  And it screws everything up and it's a wasted uber.
[101.47s -> 104.65s]  That will not happen with this setup. It will not happen, not even with this setup.
[104.65s -> 106.65s]  It won't happen with the quick fix.
[106.65s -> 109.65s]  And that tree got in the way when I was trying to hit that sniper.
[109.65s -> 112.65s]  I thought I was being all sneaky. Didn't work out as planned.
[112.65s -> 117.59s]  So we're all getting on the point here. There's about five or six people on the point right now.
[117.59s -> 119.59s]  I have to come up here and watch what happens.
[119.59s -> 122.59s]  Pop the uber again because you get a great recharge rate on this thing.
[122.59s -> 128.59s]  Everybody is now at full health rather than scrambling around to try and heal one person to like half health or something.
[128.59s -> 131.59s]  Everybody's ready to push. We get the point. We move forward.
[131.59s -> 133.59s]  Quick fix is good.
[133.59s -> 138.83s]  I'm going to say the quick fix is probably not that good on defense, but on offense it's great.
[138.83s -> 145.83s]  It is unbelievable on offense because there's so many opportunities on offense where people are just scrambling for health because they're all pushing in.
[145.83s -> 148.83s]  There's maybe a sentry. There's maybe like a nest somewhere.
[148.83s -> 154.07s]  And everyone's running backwards for health and you can just heal people so quickly that it's great for offense.
[154.07s -> 159.07s]  Defense, I'd probably recommend you use the Kritzkrieg. It's just so dominating.
[159.07s -> 163.07s]  The Kritzkrieg is just hands down the defensive medic, medigun.
[163.07s -> 166.07s]  Like there's hands down. There's nothing else I could say.
[166.07s -> 173.07s]  You could use the regular uber charge too on defense, but for the most part, if you're going to play a defensive medic, definitely, definitely use the Kritzkrieg.
[173.07s -> 180.63s]  Following around this soldier now with another uber charge, and let me just briefly talk about one important thing that I love about this.
[180.63s -> 182.63s]  I thought that was a spy. It's not a spy.
[182.63s -> 188.63s]  One briefly important thing I want to talk about is this medigun does not force you to uber a certain class.
[188.63s -> 190.81s]  Now what does that mean?
[190.81s -> 195.37s]  All the other mediguns, the Kritzkrieg and the regular uber, they force you.
[195.37s -> 203.37s]  They pigeonhole you into thinking, if I don't uber a heavy or if I don't uber a demo man, it was a complete waste of an uber and nothing can happen good.
[203.37s -> 205.37s]  Nothing good will happen if I uber somebody else.
[205.37s -> 211.85s]  You can uber a spy with this medigun and you won't feel like you've wasted it.
[211.85s -> 214.02s]  You can't say that about the other two mediguns.
[214.02s -> 217.02s]  If I told you, oh, hey, why don't you Kritzkrieg that spy over there?
[217.02s -> 221.26s]  You'd be like, shut up. I'm not going to. Get out of here.
[221.26s -> 223.26s]  Get out of here, you free to play asshole.
[223.26s -> 230.26s]  And then I'd say, hey, hey, free to play people are just as relevant as you and I. Stop being such a jerk.
[230.26s -> 233.63s]  And then he'd rage quit. And then I'm going completely off a tangent here.
[233.63s -> 235.63s]  But you understand what I'm talking about.
[235.63s -> 240.81s]  This is not a big deal. If you uber a class that's not a power class, you're going to be fine.
[240.81s -> 242.81s]  You might even get a few kills out of it too.
[242.81s -> 244.81s]  So don't be afraid to pop it on an engineer.
[244.81s -> 249.81s]  If he really needs health, if it's really a big push, pop it. Just let it go.
[249.81s -> 254.24s]  The thing recharges so damn quickly anyways, you'll have another one in no time.
[254.24s -> 256.24s]  Got a nice kill on that medic right there.
[256.24s -> 262.48s]  It's a good thing too because if I didn't kill that medic, if I wasn't the psycho that sacrificed his life,
[262.48s -> 266.48s]  then they probably would have got an uber pretty soon and then ripped through everybody.
[266.48s -> 269.48s]  So it's a good thing. It's a good thing to sacrifice yourself every now and then.
[269.48s -> 272.48s]  Hey, if a power class won't do it, then you should, right?
[272.48s -> 278.22s]  Absolutely not. Don't take that advice because as a medic, you're not supposed to do that.
[278.22s -> 282.22s]  You are not supposed to kill yourself when you're a medic like what I'm doing right here.
[282.22s -> 285.22s]  Don't do this. Let the other classes deal with it.
[285.22s -> 290.22s]  I kind of stole the kill from that Crits Creek soldier, so don't be like me.
[290.22s -> 292.52s]  Don't be like me, guys.
[293.89s -> 297.89s]  So I was so certain, guys, that somebody was going to come through here,
[297.89s -> 301.19s]  and I was going to be able to backstab them as a medic.
[301.19s -> 304.19s]  Here's another example of what not to do as a medic.
[304.19s -> 307.43s]  Wait for somebody to get behind and backstab.
[307.43s -> 310.25s]  Don't do that.
[310.25s -> 314.25s]  If you've seen my other medic videos, I play medic very, very aggressively.
[314.25s -> 319.81s]  I play medic the way you're not supposed to play medic, so take that with a grain of salt.
[319.81s -> 322.81s]  Engineer has a lot of stuff built up here. Nice dispenser, nice teleporter.
[322.81s -> 325.98s]  This engineer gets an A-plus in my book.
[325.98s -> 328.98s]  You're going to see a big, big fail on I'm not sure whose part.
[328.98s -> 331.98s]  It was probably mine, but it's this demo man right here.
[331.98s -> 337.98s]  We come across this corridor over the left, this little balcony area, and I get an Uber.
[337.98s -> 341.98s]  I come over to him, and he kind of jumps up on the railing as if he's ready to go.
[341.98s -> 344.98s]  I didn't have my mic plugged in, so it's kind of my fault.
[344.98s -> 347.98s]  He kind of jumps up on the railing, and it looks like he's waiting for me to pop it.
[347.98s -> 351.48s]  I said, all right, here he goes. Let's do it.
[351.48s -> 354.66s]  Hello? What is going on?
[354.66s -> 356.66s]  He just didn't jump down.
[356.66s -> 360.66s]  It's not really a complete waste because we do end up doing some damage to people.
[360.66s -> 363.66s]  Who am I kidding? It was a complete waste.
[363.66s -> 367.09s]  Anyways, we're in a great position right now.
[367.09s -> 370.09s]  We've got two teleporters up. We're ready to rock and roll.
[370.09s -> 373.58s]  Respawn out right into the teleporter. Fantastic.
[373.58s -> 375.58s]  Now I'm just going to frantically run around.
[375.58s -> 377.58s]  Look at all these people that need heals.
[377.58s -> 381.58s]  Running around frantically, just jing, jing, jing, jing, just healing anybody I can.
[381.58s -> 387.58s]  This is where the quick fix shines, just massively healing everybody around you.
[387.58s -> 390.82s]  I come over here to the side, and I start laughing hysterically because, watch,
[390.82s -> 393.82s]  this guy pops Kritzkrieg, and watch what the guy does.
[393.82s -> 396.82s]  He's just like, oh, hold on, I need to get some ammo.
[396.82s -> 399.82s]  Hold on, I'm just going to finish up the last part of your Kritzkrieg
[399.82s -> 402.82s]  and go over here and get some ammo. I thought that was just so funny.
[402.82s -> 404.82s]  Just like, what are you doing, man?
[404.82s -> 406.82s]  Man, you've got to stay there. You've got to stick with the team.
[406.82s -> 409.19s]  You've got to shoot those bombs.
[409.19s -> 411.19s]  So watch this. This heavy drops down. I go, I'm going to follow him.
[411.19s -> 413.19s]  I'm going to follow after him. This is going to be good.
[413.19s -> 415.19s]  We're going to win, right? Oh, no.
[415.19s -> 417.19s]  Uber right here.
[417.19s -> 419.19s]  I was so scared right here because I almost have a full Uber,
[419.19s -> 421.37s]  so I just try to do a taunt kill.
[421.37s -> 425.54s]  I realized that it was a complete and total sham right here.
[425.54s -> 427.85s]  I died.
[427.85s -> 429.85s]  You know what? If I could get this into a gameplay,
[429.85s -> 431.85s]  it would be the best thing ever.
[431.85s -> 434.85s]  If I could taunt kill the heavy and then run away
[434.85s -> 438.09s]  and somehow get back to the team, that was my thought process,
[438.09s -> 441.39s]  but it didn't work out as planned as you saw.
[441.39s -> 443.39s]  So come back, rinse and repeat. Here we go again.
[443.39s -> 445.39s]  We're going to do it all over again. Come back out here,
[445.39s -> 447.39s]  healing just everybody around me.
[447.39s -> 449.39s]  Anybody that needs it, just running around frantically again.
[449.39s -> 451.39s]  Ching, ching, ching, ching, ching.
[451.39s -> 453.39s]  And then finally, somebody gets on the point.
[453.39s -> 455.39s]  I think it's actually an engineer.
[455.39s -> 457.39s]  Somehow an engineer gets on the point,
[457.39s -> 459.39s]  and then we all just follow him.
[459.39s -> 461.39s]  Comes about right about here is where it happens.
[461.39s -> 463.39s]  I think it's this guy right here.
[463.39s -> 465.39s]  Yeah, I think, no, maybe not. Yeah, maybe it is that guy.
[465.39s -> 467.39s]  No, it was a different engineer. See, he's down there.
[467.39s -> 469.39s]  So I just get down here, I'm like, all right,
[469.39s -> 471.39s]  we have to win this right now.
[471.39s -> 473.39s]  I don't want this to go on any longer.
[473.39s -> 475.39s]  And we end up winning the game right there.
[475.39s -> 477.39s]  Thank you all so much for watching.
[477.39s -> 479.39s]  You guys are all awesome. I really appreciate all the support.
[479.39s -> 481.39s]  It really, really means a lot to me, guys.
[481.39s -> 483.39s]  Thanks so much for 2,000 subscribers.
[483.39s -> 485.39s]  Let's keep it going, too.
[485.39s -> 487.39s]  If you haven't seen that video already, go see my 2,000 sub video.
[487.39s -> 489.39s]  It took a lot of time and a lot of money to make that.
[489.39s -> 491.39s]  So hopefully you guys enjoy it.
[491.39s -> 493.63s]  And also, if you're still watching the video right now,
[493.63s -> 495.63s]  I want to ask, does anybody have
[495.63s -> 497.87s]  anybody they know
[497.87s -> 499.87s]  that can make me a custom layout, custom background
[499.87s -> 501.87s]  for my channel?
[501.87s -> 503.87s]  Because I've had this same dumpy YouTube
[503.87s -> 505.87s]  layout background for so long,
[505.87s -> 508.05s]  and I'm just looking for somebody to make me
[508.05s -> 510.05s]  something simple, something basic.
[510.05s -> 512.05s]  So private message me if you know somebody
[512.05s -> 514.05s]  or if you can do it. It'd be great.
[514.05s -> 516.05s]  Thank you so much, guys.
