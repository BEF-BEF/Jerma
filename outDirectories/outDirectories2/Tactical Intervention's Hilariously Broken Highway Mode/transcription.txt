[118.92s -> 121.10s]  Hold on I'm not ready
[121.10s -> 125.10s]  I'm not ready I need to fix this audio
[127.10s -> 131.83s]  My mic says it's back down to like 20
[131.83s -> 133.83s]  Options
[133.83s -> 135.83s]  Audio, jeez
[135.83s -> 137.83s]  Bring the mast of all down
[137.83s -> 139.83s]  I'm driving
[143.83s -> 145.83s]  Watch out there's guys behind us
[145.83s -> 147.83s]  How do I drive this car
[147.83s -> 149.83s]  Drives like a piece of shit
[149.83s -> 151.83s]  Yeah it does a little bit
[151.83s -> 153.83s]  Why do you get arrows pointing?
[153.83s -> 155.83s]  Why do I get the GPS?
[155.83s -> 157.83s]  I'm getting out
[174.90s -> 178.90s]  This is the hardest I've laughed in a long time
[178.90s -> 184.79s]  Oh my god
[184.79s -> 190.23s]  I'm just watching some guy drive his car
[199.10s -> 203.56s]  This is the best thing ever
[203.56s -> 205.56s]  How's this guy doing? He looks like he's well in the life
[205.56s -> 207.56s]  He's just like looking at me just beeping
[207.56s -> 210.12s]  What just happened?
[221.43s -> 231.93s]  He had a blue light expression
[234.74s -> 236.74s]  I'm just getting out
[236.74s -> 238.74s]  It has to be VIP
[242.33s -> 244.33s]  He's alive
[244.33s -> 246.76s]  VIP's alive
[246.76s -> 248.76s]  That makes no sense
[248.76s -> 251.96s]  Come here Jerma
[251.96s -> 254.14s]  What's with his foot?
[254.14s -> 256.14s]  He's squashed in there
[256.14s -> 258.14s]  Oh my god

[265.27s -> 267.27s]  Wait what the hell what's your name in here Jerma
[267.27s -> 269.27s]  You stole his car
[269.27s -> 272.66s]  Like five people just
[272.66s -> 274.66s]  Gunned him down like surrounded him
[274.66s -> 276.66s]  And just started firing
[276.66s -> 278.66s]  Alright I'm driving I'm going fast
[278.66s -> 280.66s]  I got the need for speed
[280.66s -> 282.66s]  Get out of the car
[282.66s -> 284.66s]  Get out of the car
[284.66s -> 286.66s]  There's two of the same guy holding their feet on the car
[286.66s -> 288.66s]  On the dash I'm stuck in this
[288.66s -> 290.66s]  Get me the
[290.66s -> 292.66s]  Behind you
[292.66s -> 294.66s]  There's two of the same guy with the feet
[294.66s -> 296.66s]  On the dash
[300.66s -> 302.66s]  Same guy
[304.66s -> 306.66s]  I seriously am passing out
[306.66s -> 308.66s]  You see the spoiler on the back of that car
[308.66s -> 310.66s]  I'm too busy blacking out
[310.66s -> 312.90s]  It just threw us into this game
[312.90s -> 315.46s]  Seriously we were at the ready screen
[315.46s -> 317.46s]  It got wicked loud
[317.46s -> 320.73s]  That was just too much
[320.73s -> 322.73s]  Too much stimulation
[322.73s -> 324.73s]  Of the brain
