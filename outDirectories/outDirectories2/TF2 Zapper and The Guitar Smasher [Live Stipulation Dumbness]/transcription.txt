[2.94s -> 9.40s]  No, please!
[9.56s -> 16.04s]  Why did I do like a spin? Why did I just like spin around like a ballerina? Dude, that was ridiculous.
[18.04s -> 33.10s]  Do the way to travel around and not get killed at least by I mean, how many scouts do they have? One, two, three,
[33.62s -> 35.50s]  get electrocuted.
[35.50s -> 39.50s]  Please let me kill somebody with the electrocution.
[52.77s -> 54.77s]  That was so dumb.
[54.81s -> 64.38s]  You want to get zapped? You want to get zapped? You want to get, you want to get zapped?
[73.59s -> 76.84s]  Come on, get over here.
[78.52s -> 84.66s]  I still haven't even described the whole point of this video and I can't unless, unless I can do it.
[85.18s -> 96.13s]  Zap. Come on. Come on. Come on. Somebody, come on. Walk in this door. Come on. Yes!
[97.13s -> 103.76s]  I did it. I did it. I've never done that before. I've never done that before.
[103.76s -> 106.16s]  That's the first time I've ever taunt killed in my life.
[109.52s -> 114.34s]  So the point of this video is the guitar smasher. Zap.
[114.50s -> 120.02s]  So did they change, if I hit a player, does it take the, I was supposed to say money.
[120.02s -> 124.27s]  Does it take the money if you zap somebody? Or does it not take the money?
[124.27s -> 130.18s]  I mean it take, I mean it does make some sense. It takes money to use electricity, electricity costs a lot of money.
[130.26s -> 139.53s]  And why is there always people in here? Go, go away. I'm trying to like taunt kill people. Oh, no. Oh, no.
[140.01s -> 146.34s]  No, look at his tiny legs. Why does he have like abnormally small legs?
[146.34s -> 152.15s]  He's got like chicken legs. Are you doing the same thing I'm doing, sir?
[152.35s -> 159.58s]  What, are we both trying to do the same thing here? With your bubblegum beard and your
[160.10s -> 166.71s]  candy cane head? All right, me and Mr. Bubblegum are gonna try to taunt kill somebody. I'm just gonna go for it.
[166.75s -> 172.07s]  My god, no, no, no, that's mine. That's my taunt kill. No, let me have it.
[172.87s -> 179.94s]  If you don't move in 115 seconds, you will be moved to spectate. Oh my god.
[180.34s -> 187.30s]  It's like yelling at me for like camping. Well, all right, I'll just zap the next person that comes up here.
[187.30s -> 194.58s]  I'm gonna zap the shit out of the person that walks around this corner. Whoever it is, your hair is gonna stand on end.
[194.78s -> 199.43s]  I don't want to get like banned from this server because I'm not moving.
[199.43s -> 211.43s]  Who wants to get zaped? Does somebody on this other team want to get zaped? Who wants to get friggin' zaped?
[212.67s -> 214.39s]  Oh, doing some zapping here.
[214.39s -> 222.97s]  He's running. No, I don't want to shoot him. Hi, my name is Sherba. I have a guitar. Do you like guitars?
[226.20s -> 231.24s]  Only allowed to zap people or taunt kill them like this guy.
[231.76s -> 233.44s]  How, what?
[233.44s -> 239.77s]  How did, man, I could have killed him and you had to just shoot him with a direct hit.
[240.41s -> 249.64s]  Not cool, man. That is what we call not cool. Zap. Get zapped.
[251.37s -> 260.39s]  Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Where is he? Where is he? Where? Wow. Wow, I almost had him.
[260.87s -> 263.39s]  He almost stood on top of that. No.
[264.79s -> 266.79s]  What? Seriously, guys?
[267.59s -> 275.78s]  You're a bastard, Jon Snow. You're a bastard. I'm not a bastard. Don't call me a bastard.
[276.02s -> 282.05s]  I'll call you a bastard and I'll rip out your guts. Am I even playing the game anymore?
[284.99s -> 289.06s]  You lost your century too. That sucks. That really sucks.
[289.54s -> 295.36s]  There's a, the sniper knows exactly where I am right now. This is gonna be really difficult.
[296.80s -> 301.42s]  Hello?
[301.42s -> 303.42s]  80, 80, 80, 80.
[305.10s -> 311.26s]  Remember guys, when in doubt, 80, 80, 80, 80, 80, 80, 80, and you'll be okay. At least like five out of ten times
[311.26s -> 314.46s]  it works. You know what? I need to build, I'm building a dispenser up here.
[316.18s -> 323.70s]  Dispenser going up. What? Easy. I know I'm breaking the stipulation rules right now,
[324.42s -> 330.98s]  but you know what? I don't give a shit. I can't do anything right now, so I might as well do something.
[330.98s -> 335.73s]  So I'm gonna build a level three dispenser. This is gonna be my base of operations, okay?
[336.37s -> 341.04s]  I'm always gonna fall back to here because no one's gonna, no one's gonna come up here on blue team.
[341.04s -> 345.44s]  Why would they ever come up here to look over here? The only way they'll ever know is if I'm like
[345.44s -> 352.93s]  glowing with the thing behind me, the cord. Okay, that sniper across, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[352.93s -> 360.85s]  wait, wait. He knows. That same sniper knows there's a dispenser up here now. Yeah, he knows I'm in
[360.85s -> 366.29s]  here. Did you see him? He's up. Yeah, screw you. You're not getting any points. I'll keep preparing
[366.29s -> 388.83s]  it. Yeah, cool. Come on, shoot it again. Shoot it again. He's just wasting his time. That sniper's
[388.83s -> 400.10s]  dead. That sniper is dead. I'm gonna go, I'm gonna, hey, hey, what's, oh my fucking god. Yeah, I left,
[400.10s -> 407.10s]  you know, whatever. You say what you want. I left. Couldn't take it anymore, but what I can take
[407.10s -> 422.70s]  is this guy. Hello? Hello? We have the same hat. Oh my god, that was so close. Oh, that was like two
[422.70s -> 430.85s]  pixels off. How is a boy supposed to get a taunt kill like this? You're just gonna get yourself
[430.85s -> 438.50s]  killed. See, you got headshot. Spy, come on. Just lock him in. He's locked in. He's locked in. He's
[438.50s -> 448.85s]  locked in. He's locked in. Yes. He couldn't move. He was locked in there. Two. That makes two taunt
[448.85s -> 457.49s]  kills. Let's go. Yikes. Crit. I just saved your life, Spy. I just saved your life. Holy shit.
[457.49s -> 476.45s]  No. Aha. Protecting the teleporter. I am the protector. You will never get this teleporter,
[476.45s -> 483.30s]  for I, I just want to, I just want to turn somebody into a fucking turkey. I just want to,
[483.30s -> 490.99s]  I want to turkey somebody. You know what? You're on this corner. Hold on. I can get this entry.
[490.99s -> 498.96s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. He just picked it up. What? What the fuck was that? What the,
[500.77s -> 511.98s]  just, just. So I just realized something. The short circuit does not have a taunt.
[511.98s -> 518.06s]  Why is that? Not even like the default just pistol taunt? Like that's weird. Is that one of the only
[518.06s -> 523.25s]  items in this whole game that does not have a taunt? That's pretty crazy if that's true.
[523.25s -> 532.18s]  Demoman, come around the corner. Here we go. Here we go. Ladies and gentlemen, here's the third
[532.18s -> 541.63s]  taunt kill. Fuck you, man. Come on. That is just so, that is just everything wrong with that.
