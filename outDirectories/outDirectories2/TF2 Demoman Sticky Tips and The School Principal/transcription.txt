[0.31s -> 15.50s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[15.50s -> 20.58s]  And tonight, gonna be playing as the Demoman, using the Sticky Bomb Launcher, of course,
[20.58s -> 27.30s]  the half Zatoichi and the lock and load, which has become my default Demoman setup ever since
[27.30s -> 32.78s]  I got the strange lock and load a few days ago. Now this video, I want to really bring
[32.82s -> 36.78s]  up something very, very important about the Demoman. I want to give you a couple of tips,
[36.78s -> 42.86s]  couple of strategies to use, because I've never done a Demoman tip video. I think I
[42.86s -> 46.94s]  said one or two things, maybe a long time ago about it. But I want to give you some
[46.94s -> 52.20s]  real strategies, at least with the Sticky Launcher. Because with the lock and load and
[52.20s -> 58.22s]  with the default grenade launcher, it's kind of spam. You get lucky sometimes with air
[58.22s -> 61.22s]  shots. You have to time it, you have to lead your targets, that type of thing. But the
[61.22s -> 66.78s]  Sticky Launcher can be a real pain in the butt for a lot of people. And I'm here to
[66.78s -> 71.82s]  save the day. Jerma saves the day. Hold on just one second. Excuse me, hold on, what?
[71.82s -> 75.90s]  You think you're going to be teaching anyone something without me here? Who the hell are
[75.90s -> 84.25s]  you? I'm the principal of the local school. Oh, okay. I mean, this is a Team Fortress
[84.25s -> 89.09s]  2 video. I don't think you really, I mean, I don't think you need to be here. It's not
[90.09s -> 99.09s]  Oh, dear you. I am the school principal. That means what I say goes. And if you don't like
[99.09s -> 103.21s]  that, then I'm going to give you a math problem to screw with your brain. Stop. 2 plus 2 is
[103.21s -> 107.21s]  4. 4 plus 4 is 8. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Okay, I understand. You're the
[107.21s -> 111.69s]  school principal. And if there's one thing I know about principals, they don't like this
[111.69s -> 116.89s]  chant. You better not do it. Homework sucks. No, stop. Homework sucks. Stop it. Homework
[116.89s -> 125.10s]  sucks. Homework sucks. Homework sucks. Homework sucks. He did it. He's gone. Oh, for now.
[125.10s -> 129.78s]  He's gone for now. And is this even a Team Fortress video anymore? This turned into like
[129.78s -> 135.34s]  outer space adventures with Jerma. What the hell is going on? Anyways, so demo man sticky
[135.34s -> 141.91s]  bomb tips. Without that guy here anymore, we can get into this. So the sticky launcher.
[141.91s -> 145.95s]  So what you want to do with this thing, the most important thing about the sticky launcher
[145.95s -> 152.64s]  is setting traps for people. And that does not necessarily mean hiding behind a corner
[152.64s -> 159.27s]  with five stickies on a doorway. When I say sticky trap, I mean real time sticky traps.
[159.27s -> 164.49s]  Think of a land mine system where you're dropping land mines where you know people are going
[164.49s -> 169.55s]  to walk. And if somebody's chasing you, especially if it is a pyro, you are going to see this
[169.55s -> 174.61s]  at least two or three times in this video, a pyro will be chasing me or any close quarters
[174.89s -> 179.93s]  scout or something like that. Drop the stickies where they are running, kind of like a bread
[179.93s -> 185.17s]  crumb trail to you. So pretend you're Hansel and Gretel and the person chasing you is the
[185.17s -> 189.29s]  witch and you're dropping these stickies down. So when they walk over the trail, you can
[189.29s -> 193.69s]  detonate it and it might not kill them for the first sticky or even the second sticky,
[193.69s -> 197.89s]  but a lot of times it only takes two or three. And for the most part, people will still chase
[197.89s -> 203.29s]  you. So definitely check out the bread crumb trail in in quotes. I guess that could be
[203.73s -> 208.28s]  what it is. But the second technique I want to talk about is one that a lot of people
[208.28s -> 212.60s]  do anyways, but I want to cover it just because some people still don't do it. It is the blind
[212.60s -> 217.78s]  fire technique. And that is where if you know there are people around a corner, don't try
[217.78s -> 222.82s]  and make a trap on the right side or wait for them to come around. Just shoot in a space
[222.82s -> 227.28s]  across the corner or around the corner where you know people are going to be. Because think
[227.28s -> 232.35s]  about every single choke point in Team Fortress. There's always going to be a ton of people
[232.35s -> 237.69s]  around certain corners, especially on payload and especially on control point. So once you
[237.69s -> 242.25s]  get the knowledge of the maps, definitely use this blind fire technique and that follows
[242.25s -> 245.85s]  up with another technique. And it's not even really a technique, but still there are people
[245.85s -> 249.61s]  that don't have this. And I was one of those people that originally I did not have this
[249.61s -> 255.77s]  enabled. Turn on hit sounds. You go to advanced options. This is also by the way how to turn
[255.77s -> 260.45s]  on the numbers, the damage numbers. So go to advanced options, turn on play a sound
[260.45s -> 264.57s]  when an enemy is hit. It's something like that. And the damage numbers as text. You
[264.57s -> 269.89s]  want both of those, especially the first one. Because what this allows you to do is blind
[269.89s -> 273.81s]  fire around corners and get the ding sound and know, okay, there's people there. Let
[273.81s -> 278.30s]  me shoot more and kill four people. And it did take me a long time to turn those on and
[278.30s -> 283.66s]  I really don't know why. I think I just didn't like change. But this is going to wrap up
[283.66s -> 288.14s]  the video guys. Thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. Hopefully you got
[288.18s -> 292.10s]  something out of this. I know there's a bunch more tips I can give, but these are just the
[292.10s -> 296.50s]  ones that I like to use. These are the ones that help me the most. So yeah, I'll catch
[296.50s -> 299.82s]  you guys all next time and take care everybody.
