[0.31s -> 13.26s]  What is going on here? I just gave myself two redstone torches.
[13.26s -> 21.53s]  What is this like dog? What? There's a dog just like sitting in this room right here.
[21.53s -> 29.29s]  Information kiosk. Oh I know what I can do. It's a dog. Hello doggy. Hello little doggy.
[29.29s -> 33.66s]  Who's your good boy? Oh no! I didn't mean to punch you. I was trying to pet you.
[33.66s -> 41.54s]  Is there a pet button in this game? Uh, no. Can I like pet him?
[41.54s -> 48.87s]  Now he's mad at me. I'm sorry dog. By the way, by the way, I saw somebody comment on your last video.
[48.87s -> 55.67s]  They said, Jerma, you know that there's an engineer skin for Minecraft, right? You should get a TF2 skin.
[55.67s -> 61.91s]  Well this is Gino from Mario RPG. It's like my favorite video game thing ever.
[61.91s -> 68.79s]  I love Gino. I don't even know why I'm a pirate to be perfectly honest. I have no idea.
[68.79s -> 74.79s]  I thought you were like a king. I am the king of pirates, of course.
[74.79s -> 78.79s]  Is it nighttime again? Let's fix that. Geez, man.
[78.79s -> 87.34s]  I wish I could just make it daytime like forever. Now you're welcome.
[87.34s -> 91.77s]  That's where the gold block goes whenever you find it. Okay. All right.
[91.77s -> 98.46s]  Are you ready? I think I'm ready to play Jungle Race. Game one. So we just go?
[98.46s -> 102.46s]  We're going to keep tally and see who wins when all this is said and done.
[102.46s -> 106.76s]  I am ready. Ready? So the whole point, we're going to get up to the top of that thing, right?
[106.76s -> 113.42s]  Are we going? Oh yeah. Obstacle course time. Oh, go. Over the slow sand.
[113.42s -> 120.22s]  Oh, this is slow sand. What the hell? Come on, come on, come on. Run, run, run, run, run, run.
[120.22s -> 124.90s]  Oh my God. I'm going to like puke. This is like pulsating.
[124.90s -> 129.40s]  They got up here. All right. We're on the bridge. No. Oh, I'm okay.
[129.40s -> 133.90s]  I'm okay. I'm all right. I'm good. I thought I fell down. I'm in the water pool. That's not where I want to be.
[133.90s -> 138.33s]  Swimming up to the surface. Oh, I see you. I see you. You're like right across from me.
[138.33s -> 142.33s]  Oh, I'm going to win. I am absolutely going to win.
[142.33s -> 146.33s]  I refuse to lose. I'm getting stuck on all the vines.
[146.33s -> 150.33s]  What's going on? Where am I? Oh, wait, the vines, right? Go, go, go, go, go.
[150.33s -> 154.33s]  The gold blocks are on the highest place of the jungle. Destroying leaves is cheating.
[154.33s -> 158.57s]  I don't even like know what this is.
[158.57s -> 162.57s]  Oh no. What is going on? The world is gone.
[162.57s -> 166.81s]  What? What? Oh, what do you know? Like half the
[166.81s -> 170.81s]  world is gone. Let me just climb up this tree. I'll be okay. Uh oh, I fell.
[170.81s -> 174.98s]  Okay. There's lots of handy ladders placed strategically
[174.98s -> 178.98s]  around these trees. All right. I see this platform. Probably supposed to go up there.
[178.98s -> 183.91s]  No, get out of the way. Up here, up here, up here, up here, up here. Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[183.91s -> 188.28s]  We're looking for the gold block, right? Yeah, there's like a
[188.28s -> 192.28s]  gold block somewhere around here. Ow. It's up here. Oh, there's a skeleton.
[192.28s -> 196.28s]  There's a skeleton on my side. Kill him. Punch him in his face.
[196.28s -> 200.28s]  Yeah, I'm not going to take time to punch him in his face when I could be trying to find the gold.
[200.28s -> 204.97s]  Oh, it's right there. It's right there. Oh my God. Go, jump. Oh, I got this in the bag.
[204.97s -> 208.97s]  I got this in the bag, I think. Wait, what? Are you already at the gold? Yeah,
[208.97s -> 213.66s]  I'm at the gold right now. Oh man. Here we go. Here we go.
[213.66s -> 217.96s]  Take only one gold block and put it in the Indian statue. All right.
[217.96s -> 222.39s]  I've already got the gold, son. I'm running out here. Wait, hold on. Where'd it go? Give me this.
[222.39s -> 227.34s]  Oh my God. Punch it again for another one. I got it. I got it. I'm good. Wait.
[227.34s -> 231.90s]  I don't know where to go. I don't know where to go. You gotta jump off the edge.
[231.90s -> 235.90s]  Oh my God. There's a creeper. You gotta be kidding me. You gotta be kidding me. Get away from me.
[235.90s -> 241.83s]  Get away from me. Oh my God. Okay.
[241.83s -> 245.83s]  I'm winning this thing. I am winning this thing. I just almost had a legit heart attack right there.
[245.83s -> 249.83s]  The world is ending. Where do I go? You have like a
[249.83s -> 256.10s]  chuckle. All right, all right. Jerma has
[256.10s -> 261.42s]  forfeited. He has died. I lost. All right, so we're gonna make a creeper.
[261.42s -> 265.78s]  You had a creeper? A creeper came right behind me and it freaked me out and gave me a heart attack.
[265.78s -> 270.79s]  985 and I'm gonna send... Hang on. Is this teleporting you to me or me to you?
[270.79s -> 278.02s]  I guess we're about to find out. Hooray. I don't...
[278.02s -> 282.71s]  Are you there? I don't see you. I'm standing right here, yeah. Hello. Go.
[282.71s -> 286.95s]  Wait. Wait, what? There's a second part to the challenge.
[286.95s -> 291.50s]  Oh, I do. Wait. Yeah, there's part two. There's part two.
[291.50s -> 296.12s]  This is the maze. We have to like climb. We have to like figure out
[296.12s -> 300.42s]  how to get out of this maze. How come I'm in yours?
[300.42s -> 304.90s]  I'm in your part of the thing. No, it meets up in
[304.90s -> 310.09s]  the middle so we're both like racing against time. Hey, hey.
[310.09s -> 315.14s]  But get away from me. Hold on. I just went
[315.14s -> 320.18s]  back. I went back to the place where I started.
[320.18s -> 325.75s]  I'm just like wandering around here trying to find the way out. Oh, it's definitely this way.
[325.75s -> 329.75s]  Oh, how did you get out there? I didn't make it.
[329.75s -> 334.76s]  Oh. I'm still stuck in the forest.
[334.76s -> 339.26s]  I can't like find my way. You're stuck in the... Oh, I found you.
[339.26s -> 343.26s]  Oh, you're already climbing up there. Wow. There's so many like things in the way. I can't see where I am.
[343.26s -> 348.20s]  I'm like in the maze. Oh, you're not. I can see
[348.20s -> 353.72s]  climbing that thing. Oh, there's an arrow. Oh, this is bad.
[353.72s -> 357.72s]  I'm gonna fall off of this for sure. Yeah, you certainly are, sir.
[357.72s -> 361.72s]  Are you already at the finish? Put the fire away.
[361.72s -> 366.33s]  Man, that was like the fastest scaling ever. How do I...
[366.33s -> 372.09s]  Do I just punch it? Did I win? Congratulations. Thank you for playing. I
[372.09s -> 377.21s]  won. I get a diamond pick. You win. And flint and
[377.21s -> 382.60s]  steel. You kind of won. You kind of like lost and
[382.60s -> 387.72s]  won. I absolutely lost the game.
[387.72s -> 392.58s]  I just failed pretty hardcore right there. I am bad
[392.58s -> 398.49s]  at jumping. Alright, so where are you? I'm still like failing at scaling this
[398.49s -> 403.50s]  wall with you so expertly like climbed up somehow.
[403.50s -> 409.46s]  I'm lighting the trees on fire. Is that bad?
[409.46s -> 413.46s]  Should I not be doing this? Is that gonna like ruin everything? I'm like
[413.46s -> 418.07s]  climbing up here just to see if I can. Just to see if I can...
[418.07s -> 422.25s]  Oh, you're over here. And I can't. I'm just a
[422.25s -> 427.26s]  complete failure. Oh, come on, Italics. I'm rooting for you. Oh, yeah, man.
[427.26s -> 431.94s]  Get out of here. No, my life.
[431.94s -> 438.47s]  I'm alive still. I don't know how, but I am. It's kind of dangerous.
[438.47s -> 442.78s]  Oh, God. Just a little dangerous. It's alright. We'll fight him off.
[442.78s -> 449.62s]  Yeah, I've got a gold sword. Fire. Burn.
[449.62s -> 455.75s]  Burn. Oh, I put you in the fire. Sorry.
[455.75s -> 459.75s]  Oh, it's okay. I forgive you. It's just a minor third degree burn.
[459.75s -> 464.25s]  So now we're gonna move on to... What's this one? Swedish Gladiators.
[464.25s -> 468.25s]  I think this one's gonna be pretty difficult though. Alright, that's
[468.25s -> 473.43s]  fine. I'm up for a challenge. I'm game. I'm game.
[473.43s -> 477.98s]  Two players needed. Obstacle race. So it's kind of like jungle race?
[477.98s -> 484.07s]  My specialty. Blue Gladiator is Notch.
[484.07s -> 488.25s]  Yellow Gladiator is Jeb. Reach the diamonds before your opponent.
[488.25s -> 492.87s]  If you fall in the water, you should start over. Okay. Sounds about
[492.87s -> 496.87s]  right. So do we have to push start or do we just go?
[496.87s -> 502.52s]  I think there's a start button. I think we just go. Is this pressure plate right here? Oh, no.
[502.52s -> 507.02s]  Okay. Step on pressure plate to make the game stop. And then I'm ready.
[507.02s -> 512.22s]  There's a button. You ready? I don't know, man. I'm getting kind of nervous. Getting those butterflies
[512.22s -> 516.22s]  right before an Olympic race. Oh, right before the meet. Here we go. This is it.
[516.22s -> 521.53s]  Are you ready? I'm ready. Do it. Do it. Go.
[521.53s -> 525.70s]  Running up the ladder. Here we go. Swedish Gladiators. Oh, yeah.
[525.70s -> 529.70s]  Alright. Jumping across an S. Oh, wow. That was close.
[529.70s -> 534.14s]  I'm not risking that. Oh, well. How do I get over here? Oh.
[534.14s -> 538.70s]  I was going to wait and see how you did that. Oh, you did it. Now what do you do?
[538.70s -> 544.58s]  I'm going through some kind of crazy obstacle course. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
[544.58s -> 549.40s]  Okay. I get it. I get it. They're trying to push me off the edge now. They're trying to push me off. Oh, my
[549.40s -> 554.84s]  God. They pushed me off. I'm back on the track, but I'm at the beginning of it.
[554.84s -> 559.72s]  I'm already at that ladder. Alright. Alright. Hang on. Hang on.
[559.72s -> 563.72s]  Next time we both fall, I'm going to like spawn in some more bread
[563.72s -> 569.85s]  because I'm losing some hunger here. Jump. Jump.
[569.85s -> 574.02s]  Oh, no. Don't jump. Just walk. I have a feeling this is going to be just like a series of fails.
[574.02s -> 578.02s]  Oh, man. No. I'll get it this time. I can see what it's trying to do.
[578.02s -> 582.02s]  The pistons. The pistons that push you off are where it really gets me.
[582.02s -> 586.39s]  I'm trying to see the pattern. My brain is too slow right now.
[586.39s -> 592.42s]  Alright. Here we go. Boom. Oh, I made it. I actually made it. Okay. I got it. I got it past the
[592.42s -> 596.42s]  Oh, you're already up there. Oh, no. Oh, my God. I don't know what to do here.
[596.42s -> 601.10s]  Is it right here? And then you jump? There's water. Oh, no.
[601.10s -> 605.10s]  Oh, man. There I go again.
[605.10s -> 609.27s]  How did you see that pattern? I didn't. I like it. I got like
[609.27s -> 613.77s]  pushed off and it like didn't push me off and then I like glitched it out. I think.
[613.77s -> 618.01s]  I could be wrong. I might be really good. I'm probably not though.
[618.01s -> 623.00s]  Okay. There's water. I got it.
[623.00s -> 627.00s]  Oh, man. Okay. Don't get
[627.00s -> 631.99s]  trampled by the mine carts. How am I supposed to do this part? Don't
[631.99s -> 637.43s]  get trampled by the mine carts. Oh, here's another pattern. Great.
[637.43s -> 642.70s]  Go. Go. I don't know how to get through the second
[642.70s -> 646.70s]  set of pistons. You gotta just jump. I fell again. Oh, you gotta jump
[646.70s -> 652.22s]  and just glitch it out. That's the only way I got through. Water.
[652.22s -> 656.52s]  Water. No, no. Water slows you down. Whoa. It's pushing me off. Oh, okay.
[656.52s -> 661.58s]  Slow down. Slow down. All right. I'm back where I was.
[661.58s -> 666.95s]  Don't let the mine carts trample you. Okay. I won't.
[666.95s -> 672.52s]  Oh, man. No, don't go. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Go. Oh, it pushed me
[672.52s -> 676.52s]  off a man three times. You're gonna win this one. Oh, I hope so.
[676.52s -> 682.86s]  You've got the system down. You've got the system. Oh, my. Do you fall?
[682.86s -> 687.54s]  I did. All right. If I get knocked, I got back to this part again.
[687.54s -> 691.72s]  Come on now. Come on. I don't want to get hit by this piston.
[691.72s -> 697.37s]  Why'd I do that? Why'd I do that? Why'd I do that? Okay, I'm good. No.
[697.37s -> 701.37s]  See, it comes out the middle. Wow. This is just, this is gonna be a fail time right here. There it is.
[701.37s -> 707.13s]  Okay. Nice and easy. Nice and easy. Don't want to mess anything up.
[707.13s -> 711.50s]  Here. I'm almost at the end. You know what they should have? Oh, my God.
[711.50s -> 715.86s]  I'm not gonna screw this up. I'm not gonna screw this up. Not gonna
[715.86s -> 722.65s]  screw this up. All right. This one, I don't think I have to double jump for this one. I'm gonna
[722.65s -> 727.58s]  freak myself out. No, I didn't. Okay. All right. I'm gonna win it.
[727.58s -> 734.30s]  So, do you have to just tipsy-turvy on this thing or what? Oh, man. I don't know where you're at.
[734.30s -> 740.18s]  I'm sneaking. Is that gonna do anything at all? I have no idea.
[740.18s -> 744.86s]  Oh, for all the time it took. I completed it. Get some wool
[744.86s -> 750.55s]  and try to hit the basket to open the door? What? What do I have to do?
[750.55s -> 758.79s]  Oh, I have to throw it? Hey, Jerma. Oh, I'm trying.
[758.79s -> 764.87s]  Hey, Jerma. Yeah? Take a look around. Did you complete it?
[764.87s -> 770.95s]  You beat it before I did? Take a look around.
[770.95s -> 775.32s]  So, is this it? I'm dancing on diamonds right now, man.
[775.32s -> 780.12s]  You shut up, bitch. I can't believe it.
[780.12s -> 784.42s]  Look at this chunk error.
[784.42s -> 789.11s]  Is there anything after this? Because there's a chunk error right there. Yeah, there's like
[789.11s -> 793.48s]  the finish line is right here. So, the finish line is right there. Okay.
[793.48s -> 797.72s]  Make sure to right-click the button. Don't left-click it.
[797.72s -> 805.51s]  This didn't do anything. Oh, I just...
[805.51s -> 810.89s]  We are the champions of... You just
[810.89s -> 814.89s]  left me in the dust back here. You're like, ah, that's my button, son.
[814.89s -> 819.32s]  Apparently, there's a zombie doing it as well.
[819.32s -> 823.32s]  The obstacle. He's on my side. He's like doing it. Look at him. He's like, oh, I want to do it too.
