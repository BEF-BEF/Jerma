[6.58s -> 20.81s]  Some foundry with... there's a briefcase here? What the fuck is going on there? They added
[20.81s -> 29.45s]  hookshots to the game? They added hookshots? This is a fucking Legend of Zelda now? How do I get one?
[30.01s -> 33.86s]  Where do I get one? Where do I get one? How do I... is it Q? It's gotta be Q.
[34.66s -> 45.14s]  It's not Q. So this item... all right, let's do... let's start hookshot. So this is just capture the
[45.14s -> 55.54s]  flag. Oh, watch out for this guy. So this is... this sticky new sticky launcher is all about
[55.54s -> 63.72s]  the quick detonations, huh? It max charges faster. This is like a combination of a lot of different
[63.72s -> 70.09s]  items because I can do stuff like this. What I meant to say was... what I meant to say was just
[70.09s -> 74.63s]  bottle this guy. That's what I meant to say. Now you know we're gonna get a hookshot.
[75.51s -> 80.39s]  He didn't even know what had happened. This guy didn't even know. That guy knew behind me,
[80.39s -> 87.19s]  but the scout in front of me doesn't. What is this? Give me this! Ooh, I got precision power-up.
[87.19s -> 94.54s]  What does that mean? Precision power-up? Do I have... holy shit, do you see how far that goes?
[96.33s -> 107.30s]  Oh my god, dude. I could like snipe... oh, you ruined it! Why am I walking around when that's in the
[107.30s -> 113.93s]  game? Why am I not going all over the place with that? How far does it go? Can I go all the way up
[113.93s -> 122.66s]  there? You've got to be shitting me right now. And these places are no longer... get up there!
[122.66s -> 132.79s]  No, don't fall! This guy... come here! He's gonna blow up from that one. Give me the Batman!
[132.79s -> 138.97s]  I got the vampire power-up. So I'm assuming I heal off of hits or something, right?
[138.97s -> 146.90s]  That's interesting. I'm gonna go be Batman. Be a bird of prey! I'm gonna just snipe people with
[146.90s -> 155.72s]  this thing. Oh my god, are you serious? I get to stay up here? This guy's not even gonna know
[155.72s -> 159.11s]  where I'm hitting him from. Lookit, he's just like... oh, he's hookshotting me. He's like,
[159.11s -> 162.23s]  what the fuck's happening? Where am I? You think you can hookshot away from me?
[162.23s -> 176.46s]  I'll hookshot to you! Hookshot heavy is crazy, man! Oh, what? Hookshot spy is even crazier.
[176.46s -> 184.87s]  Invisible hookshot. This guy's toast. That is ridiculous. You can't see me!
[187.19s -> 191.72s]  Where did I go? I was invisible the whole time, you see.
[195.16s -> 206.25s]  Again. Let's see if I can stay. No, actually, I guess I have to stay. That is so messed up.
[207.90s -> 213.48s]  You can just do that all over the place. And you can be invisible! It's like, really?
[218.07s -> 225.62s]  I have four crits right now. I gotta make use of this. Get back there. I see the mini-sentry.
[225.62s -> 233.16s]  I see you. I don't even need to disguise. Why would I disguise when I can just hookshot around?
[233.16s -> 241.80s]  Like, what's the point of disguising? Let's see if I can... I do have crits. Oh,
[241.80s -> 250.55s]  the warlock. Give me the warlock. I'll wait for him. Let's see. Ready? Ready? Ready? Ready?
[250.55s -> 260.54s]  Okay, if I can get him when he comes up. Oh, it worked. It worked. Sort of. Sort of. No,
[260.54s -> 269.02s]  I don't want to give up. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. If I just had only swung
[269.02s -> 277.38s]  a second earlier. Get me out of here. Oh my god. I'm freaking out right now. All right,
[277.38s -> 280.98s]  put a disguise on for the first time in the entire time you've been playing spy. Put
[280.98s -> 288.49s]  a enemy disguise on. Okay, good. Look, I'm just a demo man. Hi. I'm a demo man using my rocket
[289.29s -> 297.08s]  hookshot thing. Cool, huh? Oh, what? How did he know? This must be super speed.
[297.64s -> 308.20s]  Hookshot this way. Oh, come on. Oh, what? I should have hookshotted up there. I'm stupid.
[308.20s -> 316.74s]  Is this their spawn? But they're protected though, right? We can't like immediately insta kill them.
[316.74s -> 329.13s]  No, we can't. Whoa. I'm gonna try to hookshot kill this guy. I'm gonna go for a hookshot kill
[329.13s -> 348.14s]  on this guy. Where is he? Dammit. What the fuck is going on? Let's make this happen. One, two, three,
[348.14s -> 362.57s]  four. No, don't let him get away. So this quick fix medic. I wonder if he's going to follow me
[362.57s -> 377.14s]  all the way up here. Let's go. Hey, I seem to be levitating this medic. Come with me. Let's go.
[377.14s -> 382.97s]  We got places to go. Let's go this way now. Come with me. Let's fly. No.
