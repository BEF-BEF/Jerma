[0.31s -> 21.34s]  Ah, welcome to Jerma's Waterpark. Everything is so wonderful here. We got jacuzzis, we got lounging chairs, we got cool slides, whoa, yeah!
[21.34s -> 30.28s]  But the main attraction of Jerma's Waterpark is the thing that's over here. And this is the reason why I made this video.
[30.28s -> 40.19s]  Here's a high dive. Not only is this a high dive, it's a definite, like, death. If you come up here and you jump off this thing, I don't know how you're gonna survive this.
[40.19s -> 47.19s]  I don't see a feasible way to survive this. I don't see how you could ever live, but we're gonna try to get someone to do it anyways and see what happens.
[47.19s -> 48.19s]  The high dive!
[49.19s -> 61.59s]  I spent all this time making this and all the time waiting. I don't think anybody's gonna do this. I think I just wasted, like, two hours of my time.
[61.59s -> 67.66s]  Would you do it? I would never do this. No one would do this. Except for this guy. Except for this guy.
[67.66s -> 73.90s]  Please be the only brainless motherfucker in here that's gonna do this. He's doing it! He's doing it! Follow him down.
[73.90s -> 86.58s]  Oh! He's gonna crash into people! Is he alive? Did he make it into the pool? He made it in the pool! It's safe! It works!
[86.58s -> 91.31s]  Come on, let's go.
[92.87s -> 100.27s]  Tempt number two. I gotta get a good view of this. This is too long sitting here waiting for this. Here we go. Let's see what he does.
[100.27s -> 112.58s]  See ya! Oh god! Yay! Ta-da!
[113.88s -> 115.88s]  Anybody else? Anybody else?
[115.88s -> 123.99s]  Pause it. See, he is about to jump off this high dive right now and he thinks he's going in the pool.
[123.99s -> 128.30s]  Well, what we're gonna do is we're going to replace...
[128.30s -> 136.66s]  Let's replace part of this pool that he's about to dive into with, you know, just like that. Let's just see what happens.
[136.66s -> 139.80s]  Let's see what happens to this guy.
[139.80s -> 144.37s]  Time to unpause.
[144.37s -> 148.08s]  Yoink! There he goes!
[148.08s -> 159.37s]  What?! It's this kid right there! Are you serious?
[159.37s -> 167.15s]  You're completely fine after that? Where'd he go? He's fine!
[167.15s -> 176.86s]  All he has to say is, I'm hungry coming through. Beach Hut was really good value. I'm not that hungry right now.
[176.86s -> 187.10s]  You just jumped off of a 5,000 foot platform into the ground and you got right, what are you, fucking Spider-Man or Superman? What the hell?
