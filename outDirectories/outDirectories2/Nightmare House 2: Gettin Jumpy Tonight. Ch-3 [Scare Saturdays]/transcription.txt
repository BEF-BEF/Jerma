[0.31s -> 15.02s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with chapter 3 of Nightmare House 2.
[15.02s -> 21.84s]  Before we get started, crack open a fresh Dr. Pepper. Cherry Dr. Pepper. I actually haven't had this.
[21.84s -> 31.54s]  So let's see how good this is. Ah, smooth cherry Dr. Pepper. It's been too long, doctor.
[31.54s -> 40.67s]  Alright, so let's just go here. There's my bed. Pretty disheveled. Looks like a rotten corpse was lying on that.
[40.67s -> 51.94s]  Chair, get out of my face. Nothing in... No, let's just go. Time to go. Hello!
[51.94s -> 57.18s]  I remember that guy. I remember that guy from the end of the last chapter. God!
[57.18s -> 63.41s]  Don't want to have to deal with that guy.
[69.59s -> 75.59s]  Okay, so if I go into the maintenance room, I'm going to light on fire. Sweet!
[75.59s -> 83.50s]  Anything in here? Where's my flashlight? My flashlight wasn't even turned on.
[83.50s -> 89.77s]  Um, I don't think there's anything in here. I'm taking the gun out, though, because that thing...
[89.77s -> 96.06s]  Oh, I hate this chapter already, and I haven't even started playing.
[96.06s -> 106.46s]  Oh, can I open this door? No, but... Can I break this?
[106.46s -> 111.22s]  So what is this for? Well, how come I can... Oh, I can blow a hole in the wall, can't I?
[111.22s -> 116.86s]  Oh, what? No, I can't. Oh, yeah, I can. Cool.
[116.86s -> 129.87s]  So what the hell was in here? Oh, storage. Okay. I didn't mean to shoot the gun.
[129.87s -> 138.50s]  Ooh, a revolver. No, I didn't die. That's not that long.
[138.50s -> 152.70s]  Yeah, the little girl. She's a freak. Yeah, easier said than done.
[152.70s -> 164.35s]  By the way, where is this guy? How come he's not, like, chased by monsters?
[164.35s -> 171.17s]  Okay. Will do. So that guy's just not being attacked or anything. He's just kind of...
[171.17s -> 173.17s]  I thought the fire was a monster.
[173.17s -> 179.65s]  Ah! What the hell's going on? Oh, it was the fire again!
[179.65s -> 182.95s]  Man, I'm losing my mind here, guys.
[184.19s -> 191.18s]  Oh, that's nothing. Yeah. Nice, nice. Why? Why? Why? Why is it saying that?
[191.18s -> 195.58s]  Why does it keep saying that? Don't look behind you. Don't look behind you.
[195.58s -> 202.68s]  Dude, there's no vent here. Unless I can, like, blow this up.
[202.68s -> 212.10s]  Oh, okay, here it is. I would call this the first washing machine and not the third washing machine.
[212.10s -> 225.08s]  Another vent. Fantastic. Where's my gun? Ah! Is this thing you wear in a bikini?
[226.08s -> 228.08s]  Oh, no, that's just, like, charred flesh.
[228.08s -> 233.22s]  I'm just going to pre... Oh, I lost all my bullets in my revolver. Good job, Jerma.
[233.22s -> 251.24s]  That wasn't totally stupid. What? Hi. Oh, no! I hate these vents so much. Come on!
[251.24s -> 258.00s]  All right, home free. Home free. Ooh. Okay, we're good.
[258.00s -> 263.07s]  God, those things are so nerve-wracking. Charge the flashlight.
[265.78s -> 270.98s]  Can I go in? Okay. Somebody's in the bathroom. Nope.
[270.98s -> 280.21s]  Anything of interest in here? I don't think so. Nope. Let's go.
[280.21s -> 288.57s]  Flashlight. Thank you. This looks very bad. No bullets. Bullets. Bullets. Good.
[288.57s -> 295.22s]  What just laughed at me? That just sounded like somebody went...
[295.22s -> 308.42s]  Okay. What? Red. Everything's red. No flashlight works. No flashlight works.
[309.42s -> 315.79s]  Hey, lady. That's the lady. Come here. I want to question you.
[315.79s -> 323.02s]  I have some things to ask you, lady. Why are you such a creep?
[323.02s -> 332.98s]  I know that weird thing that was walking on four legs is going to appear and then puke on me.
[332.98s -> 344.73s]  I want this thing. This thing is dead. Flares? Turn that on. Does that do anything?
[344.73s -> 351.30s]  These look like flares. Okay, they are flares. What do I do with them? What do I do with the flares?
[353.30s -> 358.48s]  Oh. I need... I need four of these? Oh, it must be in here. Has to be. Yep, there it is.
[358.48s -> 364.73s]  Final power supply. Thank you very much. I'll turn the power back on in just one second, folks.
[364.73s -> 371.10s]  Pick it up! Pick it up, you bastard! Oh, my God. Get these stupid boxes out of my face.
[371.10s -> 379.86s]  Here we are. Just one moment, folks. Power be okay. There we are. Thank you. Turn it on.
[379.86s -> 392.94s]  And that is one big machine. Hey, there's the power. I'll take a sip of my Dr. Pepper now.
[392.94s -> 403.99s]  I'll take that as a reward. So now that that's turned on, can I just get out of the room now?
[403.99s -> 412.46s]  Yeah, yeah, I can. Fantastic. Cool. Here's the light for this room. Bullets, I'll take them.
[412.46s -> 421.67s]  And this... Hey, how are you? Eat lead. This guy's taking way too many hits. Come...
[423.30s -> 437.72s]  Get out of my face! Eat this! That's not working. Yeah, I'll take like 19 bullets in my face. That's fine.
[437.72s -> 449.50s]  That lady just appeared and I didn't like it. Come on. I'm going to turn around and these things are going to get up off the ground.
[449.50s -> 458.13s]  Guarantee it. Ready? One, two, three. No, not quite. I thought that was what was going to happen, but I was wrong.
[458.13s -> 471.25s]  What the hell? What the... Come on, man. This is ridiculous. You're going to get me like seasickness.
[471.25s -> 480.33s]  What the hell is that? What the hell is going on? Stop flickering. When you stop flickering, you're going to give me a migraine.
[480.33s -> 487.70s]  Get me out of here. Get me out of here. Climb the ladder. I don't even know where I am.
[495.70s -> 505.98s]  Somebody just said, Psst. Oh, I hate you. Can I drop down? Am I going to die if I drop down?
[505.98s -> 513.36s]  Yes. No, I'm not. Okay, cool. Okay, guys. Literally, I can't even see where I'm going. I'm just walking.
[514.36s -> 523.36s]  I'm just literally walking wherever I can go and falling in places. Up the pipe. We are now up out of the pipe.
[523.36s -> 537.99s]  Let's get out of here. Sweet. Sweet deal. And we have made it out of that. Hopefully we got out of that place with all the BS.
[537.99s -> 545.54s]  I seriously almost puked. Now where the hell am I? Can I go down here, it looks like?
[545.54s -> 554.73s]  All right. Thank God I'm out of that place. You're talking about just me throwing up.
[555.73s -> 565.98s]  What? Why are these things just coming out of nowhere? That thing just jumped at me and died.
[565.98s -> 575.84s]  What kind of a monster is that? I jump at you and die in midair. Get out of here. Recharge the batteries.
[575.84s -> 584.74s]  You're not dead. These things... Ready? Here we go. I knew it. Wrong one.
[592.23s -> 605.76s]  Let's go. Oh, now I'm talking about brightness. That was the brightest damn thing I've ever seen.
[605.76s -> 614.31s]  Can't do anything in here, it looks like. I can take my protein powder. Let's get out of here.
[614.31s -> 620.74s]  Check this door for any creeps. This thing just closed on its own, which means I bet you there's somebody in here having fun, hanging out.
[620.74s -> 632.74s]  Yep, this guy. How you doing, sir? Nothing. Which means... God! I got no light now.
[632.74s -> 642.60s]  How am I supposed to see where I'm going? How am I supposed to do this? Oh, there we go.
[642.60s -> 652.06s]  Everything's slow motion. Everything is slow mo. I don't like when things are slow mo. Get me out of here.
[652.06s -> 657.99s]  Get... God, that hurts every time. Get me out of here.
[657.99s -> 664.32s]  Alright, when she does that again, I'm not going to scream. Promise you. I'm just going to go like this.
[664.32s -> 680.02s]  Can't get in there. What the hell is going on? What is going on? Whoa.
[680.02s -> 690.77s]  Alright, listen. I don't like this. What is that? What the hell is going on? What the hell? Stop it.
[692.01s -> 707.58s]  Those are perfectly good beds. Can I at least take my protein powder? I gotta go in here, I think. Right? Yeah.
[707.58s -> 712.34s]  I can't even see where I'm going. I need this for the light.
[712.34s -> 720.78s]  There has been... I've jumped more times in this video than I think in all the Nightmare House videos combined.
[720.78s -> 726.78s]  And it's not even things that are scary. It's just like dumb things. Like falling off a ledge or being touched by fire.
[726.78s -> 731.58s]  Nothing like really that terrifying has happened. I'm just freaking out.
[731.58s -> 745.06s]  Um, okay. I'm missing something. What is it I'm missing? I'm not entirely sure. Man, this is so dark.
[745.06s -> 750.70s]  I need to like cheat and turn up the brightness. Wasn't that just a door here?
[750.70s -> 756.09s]  Okay, there was legitimately just a door, a thing right here. Where the hell did it go?
[756.09s -> 772.29s]  What? What's going on? What the hell is happening? What? What is going on here? Why am I like trapped in this room?
[776.47s -> 784.74s]  Um, are these walls getting smaller or something? Or am I just stupid and like not knowing how to go out of here?
[784.74s -> 790.54s]  Is there like a ladder? There has to be like a ladder. What is going on?
[790.54s -> 798.71s]  Dude, these walls are like closing in on me. I knew it. So what am I supposed to do? I'm gonna get crushed. I'm gonna get squished.
[798.71s -> 804.72s]  I'm gonna get squished. I'm gonna get squished. Where do I go? Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god.
[804.72s -> 833.53s]  Ah! What the hell? Dr. Peppa, let's drink it, baby. Oh my god. Okay. Is that the end of that chapter? It is.
[833.53s -> 839.90s]  It is. Goodness gracious. Well, thank you guys all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[839.90s -> 847.27s]  And I'll catch you guys all soon. See you next week for Scare Saturdays. Woohoo!
[856.49s -> 859.49s]  I did not think that was gonna happen. I just thought there was gonna be computers.
[859.49s -> 864.84s]  Alright, guys. See you all soon. Oh, and I almost forgot. Take care, everybody.
