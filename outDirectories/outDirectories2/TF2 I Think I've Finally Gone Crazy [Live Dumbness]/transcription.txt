[2.55s -> 5.53s]  I'm so glad that I got killed by a default demoman.
[5.53s -> 8.41s]  All right, say default demoman as fast as you possibly can.
[8.41s -> 9.54s]  Default demoman.
[9.54s -> 13.38s]  No, it has to be like, it has to be like default demoman. Let's be perfect.
[13.38s -> 14.42s]  Default demoman.
[14.42s -> 18.97s]  Default demoman. Default demoman. Default demoman.
[18.97s -> 20.81s]  This almost sounds like I'm gonna have to put effort into it.
[20.81s -> 23.67s]  Default demoman. Default demoman.
[23.67s -> 29.74s]  Default demoman. I'm gonna do this.
[37.56s -> 40.28s]  That's wrong with me. No, get away from me, baby.
[41.24s -> 42.04s]  Oh, are you gonna...
[46.82s -> 56.25s]  Oh, sentry? You want to get sentry'd?
[56.81s -> 57.53s]  Son of a bitch!
[60.54s -> 63.50s]  Oh my god, rampage.
[64.38s -> 66.14s]  This is another sentry gun.
[66.14s -> 71.69s]  God, there's so many sentry guns. This game sucks.
[71.69s -> 74.25s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here, Covenant Piss right now.
[74.25s -> 75.29s]  Covenant P, Covenant Poo.
[75.29s -> 77.53s]  We're going to be doing a live commentary right here.
[77.53s -> 81.45s]  Playing on the map CP, Gravel Pit.
[81.45s -> 83.85s]  Got Mrs. Buttsack gonna be healing me for this round.
[83.85s -> 85.45s]  Gonna be live shellcasting, like I said.
[85.45s -> 86.73s]  And here we go. We got the first point here.
[86.73s -> 87.77s]  We got a sniper coming out of the corner.
[87.77s -> 89.37s]  We got a B. Now the A is being captured.
[89.37s -> 90.17s]  Now B is being captured.
[90.17s -> 91.53s]  I got the quick fix Uber right here.
[91.53s -> 92.57s]  Trying to get this Pyro off the point.
[92.57s -> 93.85s]  I get him. I'm getting this shot in the back.
[93.85s -> 95.13s]  I've got another demoman coming from the side.
[95.13s -> 96.81s]  It's unfortunate that he was not able to get through here.
[96.81s -> 97.85s]  There's a sentry gun here.
[97.85s -> 100.57s]  Two sentry guns in a really stupid dumb place, but it's okay.
[100.57s -> 101.85s]  Let's keep going here. I want it.
[101.85s -> 104.09s]  I took this part of the live shellcast out
[104.09s -> 106.17s]  because I didn't make it very much.
[106.17s -> 107.53s]  So it just...
[107.53s -> 108.73s]  Boss that medic right there, but it's okay.
[108.73s -> 109.85s]  We got a teleporter over here.
[109.93s -> 110.89s]  Oh my goodness gracious.
[110.89s -> 111.93s]  Ladies and gentlemen, we got the teleporter down.
[111.93s -> 113.45s]  We got the engineer down as well.
[113.45s -> 115.05s]  Jerma seems to know what he's doing here.
[115.93s -> 117.13s]  Oh, now he's at spawn.
[117.77s -> 119.37s]  What the fuck is he doing at spawn?
[119.37s -> 121.53s]  Ladies and gentlemen, he's doing some really crazy stuff right here.
[124.89s -> 139.32s]  You kept that going for a really long time.
[139.32s -> 140.68s]  Where the fuck did he come from?
[144.92s -> 146.52s]  I'm just like whipping this guy.
[149.51s -> 150.63s]  You want to get whipped?
[151.75s -> 155.19s]  Oh my God.
[155.19s -> 157.10s]  How many people can I whip?
[157.18s -> 157.90s]  Let's find out.
[158.46s -> 161.26s]  Let's find out how many people I can actually kill with the whip.
[161.26s -> 162.46s]  Here comes a scout.
[162.46s -> 163.10s]  Here we go.
[165.32s -> 166.36s]  Oh no, here comes Pyro.
[167.08s -> 167.72s]  No medic.
[169.19s -> 170.23s]  Damn it.
[170.23s -> 173.21s]  Here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[173.21s -> 173.85s]  Coming down the corridor.
[173.85s -> 174.81s]  He sees a sniper.
[174.81s -> 176.25s]  Huntsman sniper, by the way, which is helps out.
[176.25s -> 176.81s]  He hits the bait.
[176.81s -> 177.61s]  It's a crit.
[177.61s -> 178.41s]  A crit rocket.
[178.41s -> 179.61s]  Guy hanging on the side of the wall there.
[179.61s -> 181.53s]  We've got some really important things going on.
[181.53s -> 182.73s]  There is a soldier up top here.
[182.73s -> 183.53s]  Jerma gets a culture.
[183.53s -> 185.05s]  One shot with the direct hit does not get the kill.
[185.05s -> 185.77s]  Default the moon.
[189.43s -> 191.67s]  Trying to do a shoutcast and it gets ruined.
[192.55s -> 194.15s]  And did you see that air shot?
[194.15s -> 195.59s]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll just get that right.
[195.59s -> 196.31s]  Get into this here.
[196.31s -> 197.59s]  Another devil man around a quick fix.
[197.59s -> 199.11s]  Uber, is he going to get the devil knight right there?
[199.11s -> 200.23s]  Gets one shot, two shots.
[200.23s -> 201.03s]  Here he comes around the corner.
[201.03s -> 201.91s]  Gets the shotgun.
[201.91s -> 203.35s]  One, two, and a three.
[203.35s -> 204.07s]  Third time's a charm.
[204.07s -> 204.95s]  Pyro going after the medic.
[204.95s -> 206.39s]  He gets a one shot, two shot, three shot.
[206.39s -> 206.95s]  Does not get the kill.
[206.95s -> 207.51s]  Gets the bet.
[207.51s -> 209.51s]  He's got to get that whip attack.
[209.51s -> 211.08s]  Yes.
[211.08s -> 212.28s]  That is so...
[212.28s -> 212.68s]  You know what?
[212.68s -> 213.96s]  Let's just stop right here.
[213.96s -> 215.46s]  Can I just say this?
[215.46s -> 218.47s]  If you can do that, you are talented.
[218.47s -> 219.27s]  You just really are.
[219.27s -> 220.79s]  Because I don't know how people continue to...
[220.79s -> 223.03s]  You know, Heavy, just fucking die.
[223.59s -> 225.03s]  Oh my God, I'm terrible.
[229.14s -> 229.78s]  Oh boy.
[232.39s -> 233.43s]  You know, I'm fine.
[233.43s -> 234.23s]  Oh my good...
[237.94s -> 238.90s]  Ow, my butthole!
[241.21s -> 241.45s]  What?
[250.92s -> 252.52s]  Is there something wrong with this engineer?
[252.52s -> 253.56s]  Like, what is going on?
[253.56s -> 255.37s]  Why?
[255.37s -> 256.01s]  What are you doing?
[257.19s -> 259.62s]  We have a point to cap, you know.
[259.62s -> 262.42s]  We have to go over there and get this point.
[262.42s -> 262.98s]  No, I...
[262.98s -> 263.70s]  Sir?
[263.70s -> 264.98s]  Sir, excuse me.
[264.98s -> 268.66s]  Sir, you have to go that way and cap the point.
[268.66s -> 269.38s]  I'm done with you.
[272.01s -> 272.73s]  Let's see how...
[276.95s -> 277.83s]  You see?
[277.83s -> 278.95s]  You see what happens?
[278.95s -> 280.87s]  You see what happens when you don't do that?
[284.71s -> 288.41s]  You want to step inside for the next Game of Thrones.
[291.06s -> 293.78s]  It's gonna be so much fun on the next Game of Thrones.
[294.74s -> 298.90s]  You have this song style that you always, always go back to.
[298.90s -> 302.02s]  And if you were like, actually, like an artist, like a musician...
[302.02s -> 302.34s]  Yeah?
[302.34s -> 303.38s]  You would be the worst.
[307.78s -> 308.66s]  Why do you say that?
[309.91s -> 311.91s]  I'm gonna go to the next Game of Thrones.
[313.91s -> 314.47s]  That's like the...
[314.47s -> 317.11s]  You're always so excited about like nothing.
[317.11s -> 317.75s]  That's a theme.
[317.75s -> 319.75s]  That's like the general theme song music.
[321.42s -> 324.86s]  Have you ever heard like a theme song from anywhere in the 80s or 90s?
[325.50s -> 329.02s]  Holy shit, did you see this pyro?
[329.02s -> 331.50s]  Every theme song in the 80s and 90s had a motto.
[331.50s -> 332.30s]  The Otto?
[332.30s -> 336.46s]  Like, for instance, like, we were moving on up to the east side.
[336.46s -> 339.90s]  Like, that was the song's motto.
[339.90s -> 342.70s]  And it said it like three or four times in the exact same tone.
[343.86s -> 344.10s]  Right?
[344.74s -> 345.14s]  Yeah.
[345.14s -> 345.86s]  Here's another one.
[348.82s -> 351.75s]  Oh yeah, child's in charge.
[354.79s -> 355.91s]  Like, the child's in charge.
[355.91s -> 356.23s]  Come on.
[356.95s -> 358.23s]  You know what I'm talking about.
[358.23s -> 359.19s]  I do know what you're talking about.
[359.19s -> 360.87s]  So that's why when you say...
[360.87s -> 364.87s]  When I'm like, you better step inside for the next Game of Thrones.
[364.87s -> 369.19s]  Like, the next Game of Thrones is the motto of the theme song.
[369.19s -> 370.81s]  The Otto?
[371.53s -> 372.09s]  No.
[372.09s -> 372.73s]  The motto.
[374.17s -> 374.41s]  No!
[376.52s -> 380.81s]  There's a pyro just standing there, like, hitting this engineer at spawn with...
[380.81s -> 381.85s]  What the fuck is...
[384.57s -> 384.97s]  Hold on.
[384.97s -> 385.29s]  What the...
[385.29s -> 385.93s]  What was that?
[388.34s -> 391.06s]  Why did the whole earth just rotate like 100 miles per hour?
[392.50s -> 393.30s]  Is that like a bug?
[393.30s -> 394.50s]  What the hell just happened?
[394.50s -> 396.42s]  Where the shadows like move across the ground?
[396.42s -> 396.90s]  Yeah.
[396.90s -> 398.66s]  Yeah, it's actually a pretty common bug.
[399.38s -> 401.46s]  I've never seen that before.
[401.46s -> 402.34s]  That was ridiculous.
[403.30s -> 405.75s]  It looked like somebody was like speed hacking above me.
[411.27s -> 411.59s]  All right.
[411.59s -> 413.43s]  Let's see how long it takes me to get headshot here.
[413.43s -> 414.63s]  Okay, that didn't take long at all.
