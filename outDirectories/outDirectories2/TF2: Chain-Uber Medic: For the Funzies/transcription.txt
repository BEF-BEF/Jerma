[0.31s -> 13.34s]  Hey, what's happening, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary,
[13.34s -> 17.78s]  and tonight, gonna be playing as the Chain Uber Medic tonight.
[17.78s -> 22.16s]  Haven't done a Medic video in quite a long time, so I figured why not just come out with
[22.16s -> 25.36s]  a fun video if you don't know what this is.
[25.36s -> 30.84s]  Essentially, it's infinite invincibility. It's having an Uber charge for more than
[30.84s -> 35.32s]  15 seconds, sometimes even as long as two minutes with an Uber.
[35.32s -> 40.08s]  It's definitely a whole lot of fun, but I recommend you don't do this all the time,
[40.08s -> 45.40s]  because it totally is just trolling. You're pretty much just trolling the other team hardcore.
[45.40s -> 49.40s]  And as you will see later on in this video, it's actually pretty easy to break up. You
[49.40s -> 53.52s]  just need a pretty good Pyro to kind of blast you around, but you'll see that later on.
[53.52s -> 59.06s]  So how do you actually pull this off? You need two Medics, obviously. Both of you need
[59.06s -> 63.86s]  to be in some type of chat program, at least in direct communication with each other. You
[63.86s -> 68.22s]  both need the Uber saw, and you both need the regular default Medigun.
[68.22s -> 73.22s]  So what you end up doing is hitting somebody on the enemy team four times with an Uber
[73.22s -> 77.38s]  saw, because that's all it takes. Then you Uber your friend. Your friend is gonna get
[77.38s -> 82.32s]  four hits, transfer it back to you, you're gonna get four hits, transfer it back to him,
[82.32s -> 86.80s]  so on and so forth, and you just keep going until you can't go anymore. And it's actually
[86.80s -> 91.36s]  quite surprising that Valve hasn't done anything about this. You would think that they would
[91.36s -> 96.36s]  do some type of patch or something like that that didn't allow more than four or five
[96.36s -> 100.40s]  Ubers to go in a row from the same Medic within a minute or so. I have no idea. There's probably
[100.40s -> 104.88s]  some way to fix this. So as you can tell on the screen, we are absolutely
[104.88s -> 109.44s]  spawn trapping them right now, which I felt kind of bad about. You always feel bad about
[109.44s -> 113.84s]  this type of thing, but it's pretty funny at the same time. So I'm playing with MLC
[113.84s -> 118.28s]  Stealth right now. MLC Stealth is a big Call of Duty guy, good friend of mine. We were
[118.28s -> 122.36s]  just messing around in the chat, we decided to do this, and the next clip is actually
[122.36s -> 127.46s]  very, very funny. Me and Stealth end up going as Medic Spies. That doesn't make any sense
[127.46s -> 133.56s]  right now, but it will in a few minutes, I promise. So I get myself killed right here.
[133.56s -> 138.40s]  Probably shouldn't be doing this. I had like 70% Uber, I could have just ran backwards,
[138.40s -> 142.72s]  found Stealth, and we could have done it all over again, but I didn't do that, got myself
[142.80s -> 146.92s]  killed. But here is the second clip. This is actually pretty funny. They Uber at the
[146.92s -> 151.32s]  same time, so we go, oh, okay, let's just keep going. We make our way through the tunnel
[151.32s -> 155.28s]  here, see an Engineer on the left, I start smashing him in the face. I always feel bad
[155.28s -> 158.76s]  about stuff like this, because I think he might have been free to play, and he probably
[158.76s -> 163.76s]  had no idea what was going on right there. Just like, oh, let me drop my sentry. What
[163.76s -> 168.24s]  the hell is this? What is that? And then he's just dead, and it's like, I'm sorry, there
[168.24s -> 173.03s]  was some crazy guy in blue goo attacking you. So this is where it gets a little interesting,
[173.67s -> 177.29s]  I say over chat, I'm going, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, sit right here for a second. Let's
[177.29s -> 183.34s]  be medic spies, and watch this, backstab, backstab, backstab. We end up killing two
[183.34s -> 188.70s]  people being medic spies, and we still stick around, and we're still alive. Get this sniper
[188.70s -> 193.04s]  as well, and then it's time to start the chain again. Probably shouldn't have done
[193.04s -> 196.64s]  that right there, because it was just one sniper, and now look, Stealth is just smacking
[196.64s -> 202.30s]  at the gate. So remember in the beginning when I said a good Pyro can really ruin this
[202.30s -> 206.30s]  for you, take a look right here, I get the charge, and every time I go for it, I just
[206.30s -> 210.94s]  keep getting compressed backwards. This is what you have to do to stop this from happening.
[210.94s -> 214.42s]  And it works out pretty well for him, because we have to retreat back into the tunnel, and
[214.42s -> 217.98s]  I end up getting the kill on him with the Blutsauger, because that tunnel is really
[217.98s -> 221.96s]  small, you can't really dodge or weave or anything like that. So it works out pretty
[221.96s -> 226.08s]  well in our favor that time, and we end up staying alive. Kill that engineer, that was
[226.08s -> 231.27s]  pretty gruesome. We were just both sticking on knives into his face. So now we're back
[231.27s -> 236.27s]  at square one, playing as Medic Spies again. And take a look, that same Pyro comes out
[236.27s -> 240.03s]  and it's like, nope, not going to go for him, I'm not going to go after that guy. Just
[240.03s -> 243.87s]  chilling out here waiting for someone that's not a Pyro to open that door, and eventually
[243.87s -> 249.67s]  a Medic comes out, and I get him with the Medic Backstab. One, two, three backstabs
[249.67s -> 254.97s]  is all it takes. So we just barely get the charge off on that Heavy, get the kill on
[254.97s -> 258.57s]  him, and now we're looking for somebody else. No one else is really around, so he runs down
[258.57s -> 263.57s]  this way towards the cart. And look who shows up to ruin the fun, the Pyro again. He does
[263.57s -> 267.25s]  his job, but we had some miraculous rescue from another Pyro. I don't even know how
[267.25s -> 272.78s]  that guy got back here. But he ends up saving the day nonetheless. So anyways, this is going
[272.78s -> 276.82s]  to be the end of the video. We end up getting ourselves killed by a Pyro. Thank you all
[276.82s -> 280.62s]  so much for watching, I really do appreciate it. Just wanted to put this video together,
[280.62s -> 285.30s]  showing some quick, goofy little shenanigans as the Chain Uber Medic. But yeah, thanks
[285.30s -> 288.82s]  guys, I will see you all next time, and take care everybody.
