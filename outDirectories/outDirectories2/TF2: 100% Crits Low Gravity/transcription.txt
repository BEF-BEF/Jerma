[0.18s -> 7.42s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a gameplay commentary on Team Fortress
[7.42s -> 12.64s]  2. Gonna be playing with the Soldier, the Scout, and the Engineer in this gameplay,
[12.64s -> 20.26s]  and before I get into anything, take a look at the screen, holy crap. This is on a 100%
[20.26s -> 25.18s]  crit low-gravity server, and before anybody freaks out, let me give you a little bit of
[25.18s -> 30.99s]  a reason why I'm doing this. So I know we had that talk the other day. The Team Fortress
[30.99s -> 36.03s]  2 is dying talk. Had a lot of good responses, you guys had a lot of good discussion from
[36.03s -> 41.65s]  that, and a lot of it got me thinking. I think it's time to try some custom maps, some custom
[41.65s -> 46.77s]  mods, some interesting game modes, that type of thing, and that's why I'm doing this.
[46.77s -> 52.53s]  This is a real, incredibly, radically different experience than playing normal Team Fortress
[52.53s -> 57.58s]  2. If you've never done something like this before, absolutely go try it. It is some of
[57.58s -> 64.38s]  the most fun I've had in this game in a very, very long time. Now, not only did this
[64.38s -> 71.23s]  server have low-gravity and 100% crits, it also had a dice mod on it, and that adds another
[71.23s -> 77.27s]  layer of insanity on top of this cake of craziness we're making here. And just in the beginning
[77.27s -> 82.39s]  for the first couple minutes, I wanted to show you some crazy one-lives or crazy situations
[82.39s -> 87.35s]  I got myself into, Scout and Soldier, the next thing after this Scout run I have right
[87.39s -> 91.91s]  here, which is ridiculous, I kill a bunch of people, but the gameplay after this, the
[91.91s -> 95.51s]  engineer, it's a full gameplay. I'm going to commentate over it, tell you some things,
[95.51s -> 101.15s]  but holy crap, words can't even describe what you're going to see. So if you happen
[101.15s -> 106.87s]  upon one of these servers at some point in the near future, which class should you play?
[106.87s -> 112.82s]  Now that's a good question, and the easiest answer is definitely the Scout. The Scout
[112.82s -> 117.50s]  can move around so fast and double-jumping, you can pretty much fly around the map like
[117.50s -> 122.42s]  a flying squirrel, it's ridiculous. And if you're going to use Scout, oh my god, the
[122.42s -> 129.70s]  hitscan weapons, not just for Scout, if you use a hitscan class and you're good, you will
[129.70s -> 134.86s]  dominate an entire server, especially with the Scout. If you can jump around and land
[134.86s -> 140.80s]  your shots really well, get some good meat shots on people, you'll kill everybody. So
[140.80s -> 145.16s]  here is the end of the Scout run, I get this last Soldier, and then we're going to transition
[145.16s -> 153.24s]  into the engineer gameplay. Starts from the beginning, and oh my god, use the Widowmaker.
[153.24s -> 158.12s]  If you get into a game that's a server like this, oh my god, use the Widowmaker. That's
[158.12s -> 164.50s]  the only thing I can say. Cause watch this guys, with the Widowmaker on a 100% crit server,
[164.50s -> 169.58s]  you will have infinite ammo, cause when you shoot somebody, you get almost all of your
[170.58s -> 177.00s]  Once you hit one person, you'll get at least, at least double or triple what you put in.
[177.00s -> 182.96s]  So as you can imagine, you can stand in a corner like this, or get in a long corridor,
[182.96s -> 189.14s]  and just fire away and just smoke everybody that walks down a hallway. And as for the
[189.14s -> 196.00s]  mini century, I think I only place maybe two, maybe three in the entire gameplay, and they
[196.00s -> 201.40s]  don't kill one person. I kill every single person in this gameplay with the Widowmaker,
[201.40s -> 205.84s]  and it gets to a point where I stop placing it, because it's wasting my metal to shoot
[205.84s -> 211.12s]  people. I go, you know, I could place a mini century right here, but who cares? I'm not
[211.12s -> 214.48s]  going to do that. And this part right here is great, look at this. You know the world
[214.48s -> 221.78s]  is upside down when an engineer kills a heavy from 500 feet away. Just unbelievable. And
[221.90s -> 229.52s]  you know it's crazy when it happens again, right here. World ending now, 2012. Is it
[229.52s -> 234.40s]  2012 yet? No it's not, it's okay. Demoman skeet shooting right there, he launched about
[234.40s -> 238.24s]  5 million feet in the air, and I ended up catching him with a little pellet, and he
[238.24s -> 242.84s]  died trying to sticky jump, I think he was trying to jump across the map, which is crazy
[242.84s -> 248.64s]  effective cause one sticky bomb will launch you across the entire map. I was actually
[248.64s -> 252.60s]  messing around with it before I captured some of this footage. It's kind of like getting
[252.60s -> 258.66s]  shot out of a cannon. You kind of feel like Evil Knievel when you do it. Oh I almost forgot
[258.66s -> 263.62s]  to bring this up. Somebody told me about a new winter crate. So I did a little research,
[263.62s -> 268.42s]  went to the wiki page, went to go find out for myself. Now I am excited for the winter
[268.42s -> 274.54s]  update cause last year, if you guys were around, last year when they did this whole crate key
[274.74s -> 280.78s]  winter thing, there were a bunch of new items and new weapons. So hopefully this is part
[280.78s -> 286.27s]  one of the saga that is the Christmas update. Just wanted to get that out there cause I
[286.27s -> 289.71s]  know I would have forgotten that, and I would have three days from now would have been like
[289.71s -> 296.70s]  did I mention the crate key? Oh dammit I didn't, that kind of sounded like grandpa. Oh by the
[296.70s -> 301.32s]  way speaking of grandpa, I know I'm going off on a wild tangent right here, but this
[301.32s -> 305.30s]  kind of has to be said, I got a lot of PMs and a lot of comments from people asking me
[305.34s -> 309.18s]  where's grandpa? Is there any more grandpa videos? What's going on with that? And I got
[309.18s -> 312.86s]  to, I'm going to say it one more time. Make sure I reiterate this to the new people that
[312.86s -> 316.66s]  came in. A lot of new guys have come into the channel. So grandpa is going to be every
[316.66s -> 323.46s]  Sunday 4 PM Pacific time on Machinima Respawn. Grandpa will appear on this channel at some
[323.46s -> 328.22s]  random times. I'll do random games with him. This is a gameplay commentary channel though.
[328.22s -> 332.98s]  If you're looking for just straight up craziness, I do other weird characters too. I have a
[332.98s -> 338.42s]  whole playlist that's dedicated to my real life skits like Burger Boy, the egg and stuff
[338.42s -> 341.12s]  like that. You guys that have been in the channel for a while know, but if you're new
[341.12s -> 345.10s]  to the channel, go check out the playlists. A lot of grandpa stuff is there and some other
[345.10s -> 349.39s]  characters you may not have heard of yet, but that is where the comedy is going to go
[349.39s -> 355.52s]  in that playlist. That is going to wrap up this commentary on the crazy 100% crit low
[355.52s -> 360.04s]  gravity server. Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. If you
[360.04s -> 364.72s]  like this video, go ahead and shoot me a like and I will see you guys all next time. Take
[364.72s -> 365.92s]  care everybody.
