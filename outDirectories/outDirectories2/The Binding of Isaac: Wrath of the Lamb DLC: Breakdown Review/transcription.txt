[0.31s -> 14.68s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some binding of Isaac, Wrath of the
[14.68s -> 19.86s]  Lamb DLC. Now, before the video gets going, you're probably wondering, Jerma, why are
[19.86s -> 23.86s]  you post-comming this game? This is very much a should-be-doing-alive comma, a let's play
[23.86s -> 28.60s]  or something like that. And the reason behind that is I want to do a breakdown of the DLC
[28.60s -> 32.40s]  and tell you all the new things because there's not really a whole lot of press about this.
[32.40s -> 37.66s]  And I'm not sure why because this game is incredibly, incredibly well done. And I never
[37.66s -> 43.23s]  did a video explaining what this game actually was, but I will do that as well in this video.
[43.23s -> 48.31s]  So the Binding of Isaac is sort of an action RPG. It's really the only thing you can think
[48.31s -> 55.47s]  of. It's sort of like a cross between Zelda and Star Tropics and Diablo and there's so
[55.47s -> 61.15s]  many different genres of game in this game. So it's very hard to describe it. But there
[61.15s -> 65.83s]  is one thing that you need to know if you buy this game. If you die one time, you have
[65.83s -> 71.09s]  to start over from the very beginning. And they call those rogue-like RPGs. So if you
[71.09s -> 74.57s]  die, you start from the beginning. And how you start this game, how you play this game,
[74.57s -> 79.21s]  is you go through randomly generated rooms. Room to room, you have to clear all the monsters,
[79.21s -> 82.57s]  just like in Star Tropics or Zelda. So you clear all the monsters in the room, you get
[82.57s -> 85.13s]  to move on to the next room and the next room and the next room. And finally, there is a
[85.13s -> 90.73s]  boss at the end and you go down deeper into the dungeon. Now you do this until you complete
[90.73s -> 96.05s]  the whole game. And like I said, if you die halfway through, there are no checkpoints.
[96.05s -> 100.29s]  You end up starting over at the very beginning with none of your required items and none
[100.29s -> 104.39s]  of your required extra health globes. Now you might be wondering to yourself, well,
[104.39s -> 107.73s]  that sounds great. That sounds fun. But why would you ever want to play that game more
[107.73s -> 111.19s]  than one or two times in a row? You might see everything you want to see within the
[111.19s -> 115.87s]  first couple of times. Well, that's because of the item system in this game. So during
[115.87s -> 119.55s]  the course of the playthrough, you're going to find randomly generated items. There are
[120.19s -> 127.19s]  this DLC, there are over 235 randomly generated items that have many different properties
[127.43s -> 131.59s]  to them. Some make you shoot faster. Some make you do more damage. Some actually do
[131.59s -> 136.61s]  worse things. They take your health away. They bring your range down. There are a lot
[136.61s -> 140.63s]  of different variables and that's why this game is so addicting. And not to mention what
[140.63s -> 146.35s]  it does to your character, because every single item in this game adds something to your character
[146.51s -> 150.35s]  or takes it away. Let's put it this way. If you get something called toothpicks, which
[150.35s -> 155.87s]  is a new item in the DLC, it literally pries your character's eyes open with toothpicks.
[155.87s -> 161.99s]  It is very gruesome and very ridiculous, but every single item does something to your character
[161.99s -> 167.49s]  model that no other item in the game does. And very, very subtly, this game has become
[167.49s -> 173.22s]  one of my favorite PC games of all time. It's just so addicting. It's so much fun. Oh,
[173.22s -> 176.82s]  you died halfway through with this amount of items and these amount of things. It's
[176.82s -> 181.90s]  okay cause you can start over again and get a totally new experience. Okay, so now that
[181.90s -> 187.02s]  you heard me praise the game and how much I love it so much, let's talk about the DLC,
[187.02s -> 194.95s]  the Wrath of the Lamb DLC. Should you get this DLC? Yes. Apsa positiva lutely, yes.
[195.23s -> 201.55s]  It is only $3, $2.99 on the Steam store right now. And the game itself is only five. So
[201.55s -> 207.35s]  the whole entire package is only eight bucks for hours and hours and hours and hours of
[207.35s -> 213.59s]  enjoyable content. I have spent $60 on some games that are not nearly as fun or nearly
[213.59s -> 220.26s]  as time-sync as this game. And that's a really good thing. So now I'm talking about the content
[220.26s -> 226.58s]  of the DLC. This is not the Binding of Isaac 2. They just added a bunch of new items, new
[226.58s -> 231.96s]  content to expand on the replayability of the original game. Now that is not a bad thing.
[231.96s -> 236.10s]  That is an incredible thing because here's what they did. So there used to be about 135
[236.10s -> 242.54s]  items. There are now over 100 new ones. So now there's 235 plus. There's five new chapters
[242.54s -> 249.78s]  to the game to play through. Over 20 new enemies, 25 new achievements, 15 new bosses, 6 new
[250.18s -> 257.36s]  room types, 5 new music tracks from that guy Danny B, who is an incredibly talented musician.
[257.36s -> 261.24s]  A new item type called trinkets that it's a passive ability. You can only have one of
[261.28s -> 266.60s]  them at a time. There are new unlockable characters. There's a ton of new secrets, some of which
[266.60s -> 270.99s]  I don't even know. I've only played through it about two times now, and there's so much
[270.99s -> 277.80s]  more stuff that I cannot wait to see. So yes, if you own the Binding of Isaac, go buy this
[277.80s -> 284.16s]  DLC right now. Because if you love that game, it only makes the game 10 times more interesting.
[284.16s -> 289.64s]  And like I said, it's only $3 for this expansion. So I mean, I spend that money every day on
[289.64s -> 295.68s]  cheeseburgers with Burger Boy anyways. So might as well use it to get some fun. So before
[295.68s -> 300.56s]  I end the video, I do have to bring this up because it is obviously very, very apparent.
[300.56s -> 305.16s]  This game is incredibly graphic. There are a lot of violent images, a lot of disturbing
[305.16s -> 312.32s]  images. So viewer discretion is strongly advised when you're going to pick up this game. And
[312.32s -> 316.04s]  if you're wondering what type of videos I'm going to be doing for Wrath of the Lamb, I'm
[316.04s -> 320.64s]  probably going to stream this game. So I'll probably intertwine this between Diablo III,
[320.64s -> 326.51s]  King Fortress 2, Binding of Isaac, GTA. So this will end up being part of the stream
[326.51s -> 332.41s]  team, I guess. So yeah, that wraps up this video, guys. Go enjoy this game. If you have
[332.41s -> 337.57s]  it already, then right on. But I'll see you guys all soon. So take care, everybody.
