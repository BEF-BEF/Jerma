[0.31s -> 15.78s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 Gameplay commentary.
[15.78s -> 22.21s]  And tonight, gonna be playing as the Cow Mangler Soldier. And I gotta apologize right off the
[22.21s -> 27.41s]  bat because I did say a long time ago I was gonna get this gameplay, and it never happened.
[27.41s -> 32.37s]  And I've done I think every single rocket launcher besides the Cow Mangler. And I am
[32.37s -> 36.97s]  sorry about this. But here it is, it's finally here. We have it, it's done, it's ready,
[36.97s -> 42.88s]  it's ready to watch, it's right here in front of us. So anyways, what do I think about the
[42.88s -> 48.62s]  Cow Mangler? I do have very, very conflicting opinions on this thing. And there are some
[48.62s -> 53.68s]  pros and of course there are cons to go along with it. And the biggest pro out of anything
[53.68s -> 59.60s]  with this weapon is obviously the fact that you can turn off buildings. If you don't know,
[59.60s -> 63.88s]  right clicking with this weapon allows you to do like a super charge like Super Saiyan
[63.88s -> 69.84s]  Kamehameha. And you take out a sentry gun or dispenser or a teleporter. Makes it totally
[69.84s -> 77.04s]  disabled, it cannot function, cannot do anything for four seconds. Now that's amazing. Especially
[77.04s -> 81.76s]  if you're playing with a group of people and you all happen to be on Skype or Mumble or
[81.76s -> 87.16s]  any of those voice chat programs. Because if you can call out when you're doing it,
[87.16s -> 91.24s]  and you say over the microphone, you say something like, hey, I'm gonna take that sentry down,
[91.24s -> 96.08s]  I'm about to do the right click, go after it, you have no fear of being shot at. It's
[96.08s -> 100.24s]  just fantastic. The person can turn the corner. Let's say it's a demo man or a heavy. That
[100.24s -> 105.70s]  sentry goes down in two seconds. So it is a very good item if you are in direct communication
[105.70s -> 111.72s]  with your teammates. Other than that though, the cons and the biggest con in my opinion
[111.72s -> 116.80s]  is the slower reload time. I cannot get over it. If you're like me, if you're an impatient
[117.40s -> 122.92s]  like me, it is very hard to get over the fact that it takes another like quarter second,
[122.92s -> 127.40s]  like point two or three seconds to get that other rocket into the chamber. It's actually
[127.40s -> 131.96s]  another reason why it's taken me so long to get this gameplay. It's cause I just, I get
[131.96s -> 135.80s]  in one-on-one fights with somebody. I burn through all my rockets and then it's like
[135.80s -> 141.92s]  ch-chunk, ch-chunk. And by the time I get one or two back, I'm just instantly dead.
[141.92s -> 146.04s]  But if you can handle that, if you can handle the little bit lower damage and you can handle
[146.04s -> 151.98s]  the reload time, it is definitely a rocket launcher you should look into. And you could
[151.98s -> 156.90s]  say that this weapon does not need ammo, but to be totally honest with you guys, I don't
[156.90s -> 161.38s]  think that's an issue anyways. Cause how many times have you had zero rockets in your rocket
[161.38s -> 165.62s]  launcher? Cause running over any weapon or picking up ammo, it's really not that difficult
[165.62s -> 170.83s]  to stay above like eight or nine rockets in the chamber. So I don't see that as a big
[170.83s -> 178.34s]  issue. So now while the second gameplay plays in the gameplay plays, that's a great word.
[178.34s -> 181.90s]  So while the second gameplay is in the background, there's two gameplays, both of them on King
[181.90s -> 187.24s]  of the Hill Harvest. I want to talk about something insane that I'm going to do. And
[187.24s -> 190.64s]  I've been alluding to this a little bit. I did, I talked about it in my live stream last
[190.64s -> 195.18s]  week, but live stream, here we go. Here, here comes the announcement. I have no idea how
[195.18s -> 199.10s]  I'm going to explain this. I'm going to try as best as I can to explain this thing I'm
[199.10s -> 207.03s]  doing. But anyways, this weekend, this coming Saturday, I am going to be doing a live stream
[207.03s -> 212.73s]  and it's going to be like unlike anything you have ever seen ever in your entire life
[212.73s -> 217.87s]  for any team Fortress 2, anything. What I plan on doing guys, I plan on doing a game
[217.87s -> 222.56s]  show. Now what does that even mean? Like a game, what do you mean game show? What I want
[222.56s -> 227.72s]  to do is I want to set up sort of like if you've, if you've ever seen deal or no deal,
[227.72s -> 233.95s]  that's really the only small piece of explanation I can give. Here's what I'm going to do. So
[233.95s -> 239.13s]  this weekend, I'm going to have 50 pieces of gift wrap. I'm going to have an entire
[239.13s -> 245.89s]  piece of my backpack, 50 slots as gift wrap. And what we're going to do is get everybody
[245.89s -> 251.61s]  into the live stream, do a trivia night and have that be up on the screen the whole time.
[251.61s -> 254.85s]  So all you're going to see is you're going to see 50 gift wrapped items, which could
[254.85s -> 260.45s]  be anything. And I mean literally anything. I've been working with this for so long, trying
[260.45s -> 265.13s]  to get items. There will be unusual hats, there will be strangers, there will be regular
[265.13s -> 269.67s]  hats, there will be strange parts. I am going to go all out with this. And what's going
[269.67s -> 276.09s]  to happen is I'm going to ask a trivia question into the stream. And the first person to answer
[276.09s -> 281.80s]  that question correctly is going to get a chance to pick one of the random gift wrapped
[281.96s -> 287.14s]  items. And whatever they open, they get to keep it. Now, if that happens to be an unusual
[287.14s -> 294.14s]  hat or a normal flare gun, that is theirs to keep forever. And that is what I'm doing
[294.14s -> 299.11s]  this weekend. Everything is going to be live. Everything's going to be uncut. It's going
[299.11s -> 304.09s]  to be just crazy. And I'm really hoping to get a really big turnout there. And to be
[304.09s -> 309.17s]  honest, the only thing you'd be missing out on is free, cool, crazy game show items. So
[309.41s -> 316.65s]  this weekend, Saturday, May 5th is going to be the huge game show live stream. It's all
[317.09s -> 322.93s]  going to be taking place on Twitch, twitch.tv slash jerma985. I want to do it on Twitch
[322.93s -> 329.05s]  because I don't want ads. I don't have a partnership. I want it to be totally uncut where everyone
[329.05s -> 336.05s]  can see everything. So come on over to Twitch this Saturday, 6pm Eastern time. Tell all
[336.29s -> 340.96s]  your friends, tell all your family members. But no, it's going to happen this weekend,
[340.96s -> 344.72s]  guys. I hope we have a lot of fun. And those of you saying, oh, Jeremy, don't, you don't
[344.72s -> 348.84s]  have to do this. You don't have to give away unusuals. That's not what this is about. It's
[348.84s -> 354.92s]  just about having fun as a community because that is what this is. So if you're concerned
[354.92s -> 359.28s]  about me losing more items, do not worry about it at all, guys. You guys know that it's not
[359.28s -> 363.30s]  a big deal to me. We can take care of this. I have a lot of friends, a lot of people helping
[363.82s -> 367.78s]  me with this as well. So do not worry. Just come, enjoy yourselves. We're going to have
[367.78s -> 374.78s]  a great time. So come on down this weekend, Saturday, May 5th to the Jerma Game Show extraordinaire.
[376.70s -> 380.52s]  Nice game show voice. But yeah, this is how I'm going to wrap the video up, guys. So thank
[380.52s -> 385.34s]  you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. And I'll see you guys all next time. So
[385.34s -> 387.90s]  take care, everybody.
