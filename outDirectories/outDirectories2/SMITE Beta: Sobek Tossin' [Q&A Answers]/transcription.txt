[0.31s -> 13.63s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some Smite gameplay.
[13.63s -> 22.63s]  Well, not really a Smite commentary, but it's a Smite gameplay and my Q&A answers portion of my Q&A video week.
[22.63s -> 28.63s]  I'm not even sure what you would call it. I know that saying Q&A answers is kind of like just saying questions and answers answers.
[28.63s -> 33.87s]  However you want to say it, this is where I answer your questions from my previous video.
[33.87s -> 38.87s]  So I'll get started right off the bat, but first I want to talk about Smite for one second, less than one minute.
[38.87s -> 44.87s]  This game is a hell of a lot of fun. If you are not into like League of Legends or you're not into Han or anything like that,
[44.87s -> 54.18s]  I'm not that guy. I am very bad at games like that. I cannot wrap my head around all the strategy and all the tactics that are involved in a MOBA game.
[54.18s -> 59.18s]  But something about this one in particular, it's just so much action. There's so much stuff to do.
[59.18s -> 65.18s]  You move with WASD, you click to attack. It's all skill shots. It's just, it doesn't feel like a MOBA.
[65.18s -> 70.18s]  It feels like a death match. It's very one-on-one, very, very intimate, very...
[70.18s -> 72.18s]  Now what am I saying here? Like it's very intimate.
[72.18s -> 78.93s]  But seriously, I've never been into games like this, but I absolutely adore this and I'm going to play it for a while probably.
[78.93s -> 82.93s]  You'll probably see a lot more content of this as well as I get better.
[82.93s -> 87.93s]  This is also in Closed Beta and I'm playing as Sobek, one of the unlockable characters.
[87.93s -> 91.93s]  And you unlock characters by getting favor. It's kind of like experience and you use experience to buy things.
[91.93s -> 96.93s]  But I will get into that a totally different time. Just enjoy that in the background while I do the Q&A.
[96.93s -> 104.30s]  So question number one was arguably the most asked question. There's not one person in particular that asked this question.
[104.30s -> 111.30s]  But it is, do you have a girlfriend or are you married? Do you have a wife or anything like that?
[111.30s -> 116.30s]  And I've answered this in previous Q&As, but there's a lot more new people since some of these old Q&As.
[116.30s -> 121.30s]  So the answer is no. I do not currently have a girlfriend. I have not had a girlfriend in quite a while.
[121.30s -> 125.30s]  It's been at least a couple years since I've been in a relationship.
[125.30s -> 131.30s]  But it's not like I'm not actively looking. Let's be really totally honest with ourselves here.
[131.30s -> 135.30s]  Nobody really actively goes to pursue a boyfriend or a girlfriend.
[135.30s -> 137.30s]  It just kind of happens, at least in the most part.
[137.30s -> 143.30s]  Every prior experience I've had with a relationship with the opposite sex, it's always been,
[143.30s -> 149.30s]  Well, I'm in the room and you're in the room and we both looked at each other and I like you and you like me. Let's date.
[149.30s -> 153.30s]  I mean, there's never like a situation where you're going actively looking for somebody.
[153.30s -> 158.30s]  Like, hmm, I wonder if there's going to be a girlfriend in this movie theater. Let's go find her.
[158.30s -> 162.47s]  Like, it doesn't really happen that way. But I mean, sometimes it can.
[162.47s -> 166.47s]  But I'll just get back to what I was saying. The answer is no, I do not currently have a girlfriend.
[166.47s -> 171.10s]  Second question comes from a bunch of people as well. No person in particular that said this.
[171.10s -> 173.10s]  What is the mic that you use?
[173.10s -> 178.10s]  So I've used a lot of different mics in the course of this last year I've been on YouTube.
[178.10s -> 184.10s]  I started with a Samson CO1U USB, which is great. It's a really good microphone. I really highly recommend it.
[184.10s -> 190.64s]  I then moved on to a Yeti Pro, which actually broke and I didn't do anything.
[190.64s -> 194.64s]  I don't know what happened to it, but I was, I don't know. I'm not going to really...
[194.64s -> 198.64s]  That's a no comment for me when it comes to Yetis and Yeti Pros.
[198.64s -> 202.64s]  But right now I'm using an MXL USB006.
[202.64s -> 207.64s]  And it's been pretty flawless ever since I took it out of the box, so I highly recommend this microphone.
[207.64s -> 213.64s]  I think it's only 90 bucks on Amazon, or maybe less than that. It's like the 80 to 120 dollar range.
[213.64s -> 220.64s]  The thing is amazing. So if you're looking for a good microphone, I would suggest the CO1U or the MXL USB006.
[220.64s -> 226.07s]  So the next question comes from Supercow376.
[226.07s -> 231.07s]  And he or she asks, did you ever play Super Smash Brothers?
[231.07s -> 235.07s]  And I could go off on a five hour tangent on this game.
[235.07s -> 238.07s]  But Super Smash Brothers is probably my favorite fighting game ever made.
[238.07s -> 243.31s]  It is one of my favorite games really of all time in regards to fun factor and multiplayer.
[243.31s -> 250.31s]  I played that game in college. Super Smash Brothers Melee, Super Smash Brothers 64, and Brawl.
[250.31s -> 254.55s]  That was my college. I used to sit with all my dorm mates, all my roommates.
[254.55s -> 258.55s]  We would sit and just do tournaments for like six hours every night.
[258.55s -> 260.55s]  It was so much fun.
[260.55s -> 266.55s]  And speaking of Super Smash Brothers, I cannot wait until they finally come out with Super Smash Brothers 4,
[266.55s -> 269.55s]  which is going to be what for the Wii U I think it is.
[269.55s -> 276.55s]  I am anxiously awaiting the SmashDojo.com to come back up and we can speculate on all the new characters.
[276.55s -> 281.55s]  And that's pretty much why I'm going to be getting a Wii U at launch, is for Super Smash Brothers 4.
[281.55s -> 287.55s]  So to answer your question, yes, I absolutely adore that series. I love that game. Super Smash Brothers.
[287.55s -> 292.30s]  So the next question is from MattTheWing525.
[292.30s -> 295.30s]  If I'm mispronouncing your names, guys, I'm really sorry about that.
[295.30s -> 297.30s]  But his question is actually a pretty funny one.
[297.30s -> 302.91s]  I heard a rumor that Star is related to you. Is that true?
[302.91s -> 307.91s]  The quick answer is no, but the long answer is who told you that?
[307.91s -> 309.91s]  Where did you get that information?
[309.91s -> 312.91s]  I mean, I guess Star comes down to Boston all the time.
[312.91s -> 314.91s]  Every couple of months he'll make a trip down here.
[314.91s -> 318.91s]  But no, he is not my cousin or my brother or something like that.
[318.91s -> 319.91s]  I just found that really funny.
[319.91s -> 324.91s]  But in the comment section of this video, Matt, paste where you got that source, where you got that info.
[324.91s -> 326.91s]  I'm very curious to know.
[326.91s -> 329.60s]  So the next question is from Lazerick.
[329.60s -> 333.60s]  And he or she asks, would you ever want to have kids?
[333.60s -> 338.84s]  Now, this is kind of a tough question, not because I don't think I can answer it, but because I really just don't know.
[338.84s -> 343.02s]  I'm getting to that point now, guys, where I'm almost 27 years old.
[343.02s -> 349.02s]  And I'm almost expected to start to get married and start having kids and start a family.
[349.02s -> 352.02s]  But I'm just not ready for that. I'm afraid to grow up.
[352.02s -> 354.02s]  I don't want to be some guy with kids.
[354.02s -> 359.02s]  I want to be like a young man and be a strong young man.
[359.02s -> 362.02s]  I don't know what that means, but I don't really want them right now.
[362.02s -> 364.02s]  I don't really have a plan to have any children.
[364.02s -> 371.02s]  If I ever do have kids, it'll probably be when I'm in my mid-30s, or I don't even know.
[371.02s -> 375.02s]  I can't really make an assessment on that because I'm just not sure.
[375.02s -> 377.02s]  But do I want them? Sure.
[377.02s -> 379.02s]  Do I know when I want them? No.
[379.02s -> 381.02s]  I guess that's the real answer.
[381.02s -> 384.70s]  Next up is a question from The Purplefish12.
[384.70s -> 388.70s]  And he or she asks, what kind of car, if any, do you drive?
[388.70s -> 391.70s]  And nobody's really ever asked this question before.
[391.70s -> 397.70s]  I drive a Chevy Malibu, a 2003, I think, a 2002 maybe.
[397.70s -> 400.70s]  It is pure gold, Midas Gold, baby.
[400.70s -> 403.70s]  It's a nice car. It's just a regular town kind of economy car.
[403.70s -> 405.70s]  And I really wouldn't have it any other way.
[405.70s -> 409.70s]  I'm not the type of guy that wants to drive around in a Ferrari or like a Lamborghini or something like that,
[409.70s -> 412.70s]  because I'm afraid to drive those cars.
[412.70s -> 417.70s]  I've seen those cars driven, and I've seen the condition that a lot of those cars are in.
[417.70s -> 420.70s]  They are pristine. I wouldn't be able to handle it.
[420.70s -> 426.88s]  I would keep that car in my garage, and I would probably never drive it for any circumstance whatsoever,
[426.88s -> 430.88s]  mainly because of the fear of it getting a scratch or something, and they're just so expensive.
[430.88s -> 434.88s]  I'll stick with my little economy car. That's good for me.
[434.88s -> 442.70s]  So next up is Faze7963, and he or she asks, how did you meet Burger Boy?
[442.70s -> 446.94s]  So Burger Boy, if you don't know who Burger Boy is, he's like my best friend of the whole world.
[446.94s -> 450.94s]  And he's in a lot of videos. He's been in a couple of the milestone videos.
[450.94s -> 454.94s]  He was Santa Claus for the Christmas video, and he's just a really good buddy of mine.
[454.94s -> 456.94s]  Where did I meet him?
[456.94s -> 460.11s]  Well, that's a pretty simple answer. He lives right down the street from me.
[460.11s -> 462.11s]  We grew up together. I've known him for more than 20 years.
[462.11s -> 466.11s]  Went to the same kindergarten, same middle school, same high school, same everything.
[466.11s -> 472.11s]  And he's just been that guy that's been down the street where I can just walk to his house if I really wanted to.
[472.11s -> 473.11s]  It's less than a mile away.
[473.11s -> 476.11s]  And I mean, it was just easy to get to his house. We shared the same interests.
[476.11s -> 480.11s]  He loves video games. I love video games. We both played baseball together.
[480.11s -> 484.11s]  So it was just easy. We were perfect fit. Perfect fit, baby.
[484.11s -> 487.29s]  So the next question is from Dollory.
[487.29s -> 491.29s]  And Dollory asks, what is your most played game of all time?
[491.29s -> 495.46s]  Now, I like this question because this is not what is your favorite game of all time.
[495.46s -> 497.46s]  What is your least favorite game of all time?
[497.46s -> 499.46s]  It's just what is your most played game?
[499.46s -> 502.46s]  And that is probably going to be World of Warcraft.
[502.46s -> 506.46s]  I put, if I were to do the math right now, it would probably make me puke.
[506.46s -> 511.83s]  But I have probably put at least three or four thousand hours into that game.
[511.83s -> 514.01s]  At least, at the very least.
[514.01s -> 518.01s]  Coming in at a close second, though, is Team Fortress 2, I would have to assume.
[518.01s -> 522.01s]  Because I've been playing this game since God the Beta, and it's been a long time.
[522.01s -> 527.01s]  At least a couple thousand hours into the series of Team Fortress, including Team Fortress Classic.
[527.01s -> 533.01s]  So I'd say Team Fortress as a series and World of Warcraft are my most played games.
[533.01s -> 537.50s]  Next up is from Incantare Fox, and they ask,
[537.50s -> 541.50s]  how do you feel your commentary style has changed since the start?
[541.50s -> 547.29s]  And that can be answered in one word, and one word only, comfortable.
[547.29s -> 550.29s]  That's really, you have to get comfortable, and you have to really get confident.
[550.29s -> 551.29s]  You've got to sit down.
[551.29s -> 555.29s]  And that's the best advice I can give to any aspiring YouTube commentator,
[555.29s -> 558.29s]  is just be as comfortable and as confident as you can.
[558.29s -> 561.29s]  And whatever ways you can do that, whatever techniques you can find,
[561.29s -> 565.29s]  or relaxing things you can do to yourself to make it so when you sit in front of this microphone,
[565.29s -> 568.29s]  you can just go and talk about anything and everything.
[568.29s -> 570.29s]  That is what you have to do.
[570.29s -> 573.29s]  And it's very, very difficult. It can be hard to find that thing.
[573.29s -> 577.29s]  But once you find it, it'll just make you that much more comfortable.
[577.29s -> 582.46s]  So I could go on with that for a long time, but I'm going to bring up the next question,
[582.46s -> 584.90s]  which might be the last one of this video.
[584.90s -> 588.90s]  And that is, where do you see yourself in one year, five years, ten years?
[588.90s -> 592.90s]  I got a lot of these different, like, oh, what do you think will happen on YouTube next year?
[592.90s -> 594.90s]  Or where do you see yourself in five years?
[594.90s -> 596.90s]  And it's really hard to answer those questions.
[596.90s -> 600.90s]  And what I really hope is in the next five years, the next ten years, one year,
[600.90s -> 604.90s]  whatever it happens, the future of my life, I just hope I'm happy.
[604.90s -> 611.07s]  You know, that's really all I really ask is that I'm happy and my friends are happy, my family's happy,
[611.07s -> 613.07s]  all you guys are all happy.
[613.07s -> 616.07s]  It's hard to predict what's going to happen.
[616.07s -> 620.07s]  Nobody can really have a magic crystal ball and say, well, in five years, Jerma,
[620.07s -> 623.07s]  you're going to have two hundred billion dollars in your bank account
[623.07s -> 627.50s]  and you're going to own Ben and Jerry's ice cream factory.
[627.50s -> 629.50s]  I mean, nobody really can predict that.
[629.50s -> 633.50s]  But I just hope that I can get to a position where I'm happy with my life
[633.50s -> 638.50s]  and I'm just here and I'm still here and I live a healthy life, as healthy as I can.
[638.50s -> 641.50s]  And that's really all I could ask for.
[641.50s -> 643.94s]  But that is going to wrap up the video, guys.
[643.94s -> 645.94s]  Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[645.94s -> 648.94s]  I'll probably do another one of these in a week or two.
[648.94s -> 652.11s]  Probably change this time slot, not going to be on Friday night,
[652.11s -> 654.11s]  but I will get that done soon.
[654.11s -> 656.11s]  Again, thank you so much for your questions.
[656.11s -> 658.11s]  I really appreciate it, guys. There were a lot of good ones.
[658.11s -> 660.11s]  And I will see you guys all next time.
[660.11s -> 664.11s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
