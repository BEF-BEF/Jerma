[0.31s -> 16.17s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some super meat boy. That's right. I'm gonna start this on the channel.
[16.17s -> 25.97s]  I'm probably gonna play through the entire thing. Not in one sitting, not in this video, but I'm probably gonna try and do each chapter will be a different episode.
[25.97s -> 34.57s]  So some episodes might be 20 minutes, 25 minutes. Some episodes might be like 40 minutes. I'm not sure. I don't know how I'm gonna break it up yet.
[34.77s -> 41.21s]  But I think I want to break it up per chapter. Now the reason why I decided to do this, mainly because...
[41.21s -> 46.44s]  Hold on, we'll watch the cutscene first. Oh, I see super meat boy and his girlfriend just hanging out at the park.
[46.44s -> 60.39s]  Watch out here! He punched her in the face. If you've never played this game, then oh my goodness, this is a classic. You have to get your hands on this game.
[60.39s -> 66.09s]  Let's start right from the very beginning. I deleted all my save file stuff, so I'll make sure I'll be right at the very beginning.
[66.09s -> 74.09s]  But I digress. The reason why I started to do this is because I'm a huge fan of Binding of Isaac, as you've seen on the channel, and the same guy made this game.
[74.09s -> 83.33s]  Edmund McMillan. Not Edward McMillan. I always say Edward for some reason. I don't know why. There's no W to be found in his entire name.
[83.33s -> 89.13s]  But he made this game, and he made Binding of Isaac, so I figured I'd pay homage to him, homage to him, and play this one.
[90.69s -> 100.44s]  What is going on here? Oh my god. Why am I running a mill? What's going on? Okay, my controller is all screwed up. Hold on a second.
[100.44s -> 112.69s]  What is happening here? Okay, we're back. That was really weird. It was something to do with DXTory and recording, but let me just start playing.
[112.69s -> 122.05s]  I was just like, just going 100 miles per hour. But I'm pretty good at this game. I used to play this game a lot with Burger Boy.
[122.05s -> 128.53s]  And I completed a lot of stuff with this game. I got A-pluses on a lot of levels. Let's see if I can't do that again.
[128.53s -> 133.48s]  Because I gotta go quick. Gotta go super fast. That's the most important thing. And get that, Band-Aid.
[133.48s -> 143.22s]  No, give me the Band-Aid. Here we are. Oh, right when I say I'm good at this game, let me jump over the bride-to-be.
[143.22s -> 152.10s]  Let's go, let's go. The faster, the better. Warp Zone? Let's do the Warp Zone. Why not?
[152.10s -> 158.72s]  Warp Zone is where it takes you out of the game and brings you to a very strange place. Like this.
[158.72s -> 171.54s]  All right, let's do it, baby. Little 8-bit meat boy. He's so cute. Speed, run, speed, run, speed, run.
[171.54s -> 178.92s]  Actually, speed doesn't really matter here because you're just trying to complete everything. I could go for that Band-Aid.
[178.92s -> 185.29s]  But you know what? Just going for completion right now. If I want to go back later and do that, I absolutely will.
[185.29s -> 198.10s]  This is where it gets a little fishy. All right.
[198.10s -> 204.28s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That was a dumb move. I forgot the dumb idiot.
[204.28s -> 216.71s]  All right. Nice and easy here. I only got two more lives. Oh, there we go. Super Meat Boy. Oh, sorry, Super Meat Boy.
[216.71s -> 227.07s]  There we go. What'd I get for it? Nothing. Just keep going with this level. Level 5.
[227.07s -> 231.63s]  So I probably should explain what this game is if you don't know.
[231.63s -> 241.36s]  It is a platform jumper where the whole point is to grab onto these walls and launch yourself up as fast as you can to get the A pluses.
[241.36s -> 244.36s]  Well, you don't have to get an A plus, but that's what I like to do.
[244.36s -> 252.30s]  And you only get one life. And it's just it's not really a puzzle. It's just a test of reflexes.
[252.30s -> 258.54s]  And when and if you pull your hair out during this game is the real question at hand.
[258.54s -> 264.36s]  Because the game gets at least it's a joke how hard this game gets.
[264.36s -> 272.38s]  Oh, now I'm screwed. I'm going to get that bandaid. I can't I can't skip them all. I got to at least get a couple.
[272.38s -> 283.94s]  Here we go. No. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Go. No. Now I screwed it all up.
[283.94s -> 294.32s]  Oh, I can't even get it. All right. Last try here. This is it. Oh, no. I really messed things up. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[294.32s -> 307.40s]  If I can just do this nice and slow, be good. Let the rage begin. Let the rage turn on here.
[307.40s -> 317.76s]  I missed it. I missed it again. No, no, no. There we go. If I just I missed it again. You know what?
[317.76s -> 330.68s]  Screw it. Let's just end the damn level. Just keep going. I'll sneak up. Sneaky snake. Let's go, baby.
[330.68s -> 339.97s]  Nope. I'll be going this time, though. We are right in there. Oh, snuck in there.
[339.97s -> 353.02s]  So chapter one chapter. Oh, look at that program.
[353.02s -> 358.03s]  That's what I'm talking about. And I got the bandage. I see that's what you have to do.
[358.03s -> 364.26s]  You got to you just got to let your brain turn off and just play the game the way it was meant to be played.
[364.26s -> 372.68s]  Freaking out warp zone. Let's go for it. And I think this is where do you get command a video?
[372.68s -> 382.22s]  I think he's here, right? Maybe. Oh, and help me. Don't worry. I'll save you.
[382.22s -> 388.15s]  Here's command a video. My favorite character in the game. Yeah. Let's do it.
[388.15s -> 391.45s]  Command a video. Command a video is one of the unlockables.
[391.45s -> 398.14s]  You can pull down the jump button and you can hold down the jump button and glide.
[398.14s -> 404.82s]  It's very, very useful. He is probably the best character in the game, at least in my opinion.
[404.82s -> 411.58s]  Actually, one could be the Minecraft guy is probably the best character in the game. Whoa.
[411.58s -> 421.04s]  Hey, I could probably make it across that whole thing. What do you think? Definitely.
[421.04s -> 432.71s]  I now have commander video from Bit Trip runner. Good to go. I'm going to use them. Why not?
[432.71s -> 440.75s]  Let's use commander video. Yunk. His downside is he's very slow.
[440.75s -> 447.57s]  Meat Boy is lightning fast and he's kind of like a slug, but you know what? He gets the job done.
[447.57s -> 454.59s]  Plus, I don't freak out as much with commander video like I do with Meat Boy because I'm not going a thousand miles per hour.
[454.59s -> 470.27s]  Now let's make this work and drop right down. Hello, girl. I'll take an A plus with a side of cheese and onion.
[474.90s -> 490.26s]  Make it up. Make it up. You slug bastard. Now this is where we jump and we jump and we jump.
[490.26s -> 502.42s]  Next level. Oh, this might be hard with commander video because he's slow because he's slow.
[502.42s -> 514.71s]  Down. No A plus. Come on. No, that's not cool. Jump. Jump.
[514.71s -> 521.45s]  No, I wasn't going to make it. I would never have made that. I know my limit says commander video.
[521.45s -> 524.01s]  Are you okay?
[528.60s -> 533.96s]  Oh, look at him. I'm like off screen right now. I already watched this. Hooray.
[533.96s -> 545.05s]  Oh, I made it. I'm actually going to die. Nice. Okay. Level 19 intermission. Sounds like a plan.
[545.05s -> 555.44s]  Rocking. I can tell you a story of when I played this game over Burger Boys and went to a very hard.
[555.44s -> 562.44s]  It was dark world. Essentially, when you when you get an A plus in a level, it unlocks a harder version of the same level.
[562.44s -> 570.44s]  And it's in the dark world, they call it. So one of the last levels I got to in the dark world, I was at Burger Boy's house.
[570.44s -> 580.44s]  And oh my God, I must have died a thousand times, probably more.
[580.44s -> 587.68s]  And Burger Boy made me stop playing. He's like, dude, Jeremy, you need to stop, man. You you are really freaking out right now.
[587.68s -> 594.92s]  You need to like let's like go do something. And I just had this like red eyes like, no, I refuse to stop.
[594.92s -> 604.96s]  And now that's what this game can really do to you is you get sucked in and every death is like taking another hit of crack.
[604.96s -> 612.68s]  See, this is the part where I get a little antsy because I want to go. I want to go, go, go, go, go video.
[612.68s -> 620.05s]  You are slow. All right. We're getting close here. Yeah. This is the first boss of chapter one.
[620.05s -> 628.12s]  Let's see. Let's let's smash a little slugger. Look, let's take a look at the cinematic, of course, going to dump gasoline all over the place.
[628.12s -> 633.12s]  He's going to turn around. He's going to be like, screw you, Burger Boys. Oh, I just said Burger Boy.
[633.12s -> 640.00s]  He's going to like the forest on fire. Why? Why would you do such a thing?
[640.00s -> 647.50s]  And these characters are in Binding of Isaac. If you see them. Oh, God, that's what happens when you don't pay attention. Go, go, go.
[647.50s -> 659.72s]  And you have to play as Meat Boy for all the boss encounters, which really stinks at some points because I would love to play some of the unlockables.
[659.72s -> 665.89s]  But you know what? You just got to go. Forget about everything else and just run, baby. Run.
[665.89s -> 678.13s]  And this is going to be. Oh, my God. Come on. Come on. Oh, get up there, you. Oh, what? What? Oh, what happened?
[678.13s -> 684.38s]  Oh, God. Come on. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it. Get it.
[685.38s -> 697.10s]  I was going so well, too. I beat it. I beat it in first try, except I fell off and landed on the guy's skull cap.
[697.10s -> 704.87s]  This time, I'm not going to mess this up. I'm not going to screw it up this time. What am I?
[704.87s -> 711.68s]  I got a little time here. I can chill out. Not here, though. Good. All righty.
[711.68s -> 723.67s]  You are dead, big chainsaw machine, dude. Not a moment too soon. You lose. Oh, I feel bad.
[723.67s -> 732.76s]  Hi. What the hell? I wish they would make noises like this in games.
[732.76s -> 739.00s]  I wish there would be somebody screaming like that. This part I don't. I get it. I understand.
[739.00s -> 744.75s]  But it just is like, wait, what? The poor squirrels. I think it's like the squirrels family or something.
[744.75s -> 755.68s]  That's a pretty big family. He'll get his revenge one day. The squirrel. I wish he appears later.
[755.68s -> 761.56s]  Spoiler. He doesn't or spoiler. He does. You never know. Oh, my God.
[761.56s -> 770.57s]  I don't think I've ever watched that cut scene long enough to know that that happens.
[770.57s -> 778.44s]  I usually just skip it. He gets his head cut off with a saw. My God. Morbid.
[778.44s -> 786.20s]  All right. So moving on to chapter two in episode two. Thank you guys all so much for watching.
[786.20s -> 791.57s]  Really do appreciate it. And let's keep the super meat boy train rolling. Probably going to do this once a week, probably.
[791.57s -> 798.81s]  You probably see this once a week until I finish it, of course. So the rage will begin coming soon to a theater near you.
[798.81s -> 801.81s]  Take care, everybody, and see you later.
