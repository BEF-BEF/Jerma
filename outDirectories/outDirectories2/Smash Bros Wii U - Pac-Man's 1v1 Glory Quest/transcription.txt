[4.92s -> 11.49s]  This is a one-on-one. I haven't even unlocked like any characters. It doesn't even matter. Does it really matter?
[11.49s -> 19.06s]  Do I need to unlock characters when you got fuckin' Pac-Man on this list? Gotta make sure I choose my right control setup.
[19.06s -> 28.78s]  Who's first? Who's first in the For Glory ranked 1v1 Pac-Man vs. the Entire Universe?
[28.94s -> 38.99s]  Yeah, we get this guy's Robin. Two-stock. Let's do it. I'll show you guys how it's done.
[38.99s -> 41.95s]  I'll show you how to... I'm gonna be one of the most professional
[42.55s -> 44.63s]  athletes you've ever seen in this game.
[44.79s -> 52.62s]  See, all I know is that you gotta have the hydrant down. When the hydrant's down, you can do extra damage.
[52.62s -> 54.62s]  You can launch it at people
[54.66s -> 59.16s]  or you can just get hit by everything that he's done so far. That works, too.
[59.40s -> 62.76s]  You see that? Do you see that hydrant play? You see that hydrant play?
[63.24s -> 68.40s]  See that? You see that double? Oh my god, you're talking about the best fuckin' Pac-Man in the world.
[68.40s -> 74.68s]  I don't really have a follow-up to that one.
[77.25s -> 81.40s]  I gotta like concentrate. I don't want to lose this. This is my first ever ranked match.
[81.88s -> 91.77s]  You know what I mean? You can't like screw this up. I want to come down. Is that right? 104%. I'm doing good.
[91.77s -> 97.83s]  I'm doing fine. No, I'm not. That was a mistake. And now she's gonna launch it again at me. No, do not dodge!
[98.39s -> 104.78s]  Fuck!
[104.78s -> 108.25s]  I missed! I missed again!
[110.57s -> 115.70s]  All right, sit up. Fucking sit up and play the goddamn fucking game.
[119.95s -> 126.82s]  That fire move. What was that? I don't even know these characters yet. I don't know what I'm doing.
[127.42s -> 131.43s]  There we go. All right, time to shape up.
[132.86s -> 138.36s]  That was close. That was a hydrant play. This is a hydrant play.
[138.88s -> 142.46s]  This is a hydrant play. Right here, guys.
[142.46s -> 147.14s]  Hey, we're gonna play Smash Brothers?
[147.38s -> 156.29s]  How about we play Jerma gets publicly embarrassed? That works, too. How did you- what is this?
[156.97s -> 158.97s]  What is this, like, super smoke that you're doing to me?
[159.29s -> 168.95s]  I'm telling you, comeback of the year right here, guys. You think it's a joke? Oh, come on. What is that move?
[169.35s -> 183.70s]  It fell off. It's all right. I can recover this. Oh, did you see that recover? Come here! Come here!
[184.10s -> 188.12s]  How am I still here?
[188.12s -> 198.46s]  No, what the fuck? Drop it. I know what you're gonna try to do.
[198.94s -> 207.49s]  Sure, I could have capitalized on that, but I didn't. All right, now I gotta launch it. Now I gotta launch it.
[208.05s -> 212.94s]  Bang. It's all right. He's a little- he's a little confused. Now I get him with the fruit.
[214.47s -> 225.13s]  Oh shit! That one was backfired. What? What? Why did that not hit him? That went right through his body.
[225.69s -> 233.48s]  That was a load of dog shit. It's all right. I can- I can recover from this one.
[234.24s -> 245.12s]  Dammit, I threw the jello in the wrong direction. I lost. Throw the flu- throw the strawberry at him.
[245.24s -> 247.80s]  You picked up my strawberry?
[247.96s -> 251.28s]  You used my own strawberry on me? That's when you turned it on.
[251.84s -> 256.50s]  Now I'm angry you picked up my strawberry not long ago. Those strawberries took the grow on my farm.
[257.18s -> 262.06s]  Two months! How long does strawberry take to grow? Like, a week? I don't know.
[262.54s -> 269.82s]  Ten days? No, that's UPS ground shipping. We're not talking about ground shipping. We're talking about strawberry growth.
[270.54s -> 278.58s]  There we go. Now that you did that, you really started- you really got me angry with that one. Okay, I'll just come grab you.
[278.94s -> 283.55s]  Nope, I missed. Oh, I got to win this one. Come on.
[288.57s -> 295.81s]  Don't do it. Oh, don't do it. Don't do it, you motherfucker! I lost again!
[298.42s -> 302.88s]  19 ranked games and only two victories.
[304.52s -> 313.45s]  I have a 10% win rate. Guys, I'm pretty sure that I have better winning percentage
[313.83s -> 320.58s]  with scratch tickets. I feel like I've played the lottery in one more games than I have in fucking Smash Brothers.
[324.57s -> 326.57s]  Pac-Man versus Bowser, huh?
[327.46s -> 334.20s]  All right. I heard you liked balloons. Oh dear. Okay, I gotta be careful. He has like
[334.92s -> 336.92s]  some dash moves and stuff, I think.
[337.24s -> 340.04s]  Wait, can he grab you and like drop you off the stage?
[342.31s -> 348.60s]  Oh, I almost just- I almost just died there. See if I can get him. Got him.
[350.46s -> 355.72s]  Whoa, can he do that from the trampoline? Shit. I think that's the move I'm thinking of that he has.
[356.90s -> 363.58s]  Don't even think about it. You know, I get too caught up in dropping that hydra. That's like the pro-
[363.74s -> 368.04s]  What- I'm sitting here talking. Rude. I was telling a story.
[375.91s -> 377.85s]  I apologize in advance,
[377.85s -> 381.77s]  but I gotta be quiet for this one. So enjoy- enjoy the gameplay.
[382.33s -> 386.09s]  Enjoy the gameplay because that's what's gonna be in the background of this gameplay commentary.
[386.25s -> 389.29s]  Hey, what's going on guys? Jerma here with a gameplay commentary.
[389.77s -> 393.93s]  Uh, this is post, so I'm not playing the game right now. That's because, you know, you probably could guess.
[395.48s -> 400.06s]  I suck.
[400.06s -> 403.96s]  I got a- I got a new costume. You know, it's all about the costume, I think, in my opinion.
[405.06s -> 409.16s]  If you don't have a good costume on, I mean you might as well. Why did none of us hit that?
[413.98s -> 425.53s]  Oh, that would have been sick if I just hit it with him. Come here. Jump into it.
[426.26s -> 428.26s]  Oh, you got hit by the balloon.
[429.82s -> 431.82s]  Oh, that was a full smash.
[432.14s -> 435.58s]  Right, we're good. We're good.
[435.58s -> 440.87s]  Didn't want to do that, but it's all right. It's- it's still kind of worked out. Drop the hammer on him. Turn around.
[441.43s -> 442.87s]  Smash it into him.
[442.87s -> 445.91s]  Perfect. Follow up with the up in the air. Up in the air, trampoline.
[446.47s -> 447.67s]  Double.
[447.67s -> 450.39s]  Yep, that's exactly what I wanted to have happen. And then,
[451.03s -> 454.95s]  you're gonna throw the key at him. Oh shit. No, you're not. You're gonna throw the fucking balloon at him again.
[455.27s -> 461.75s]  It's gonna miss. It's all right. I got a- I got an advantage over this one.
[464.34s -> 468.38s]  Damn it.
[470.62s -> 481.02s]  He's at 72%. I should- I should get this. I should be all right. Oh, come on. That's what it is right there.
[481.02s -> 485.56s]  You can't- you can't recover for this one.
[487.80s -> 490.84s]  Come on.
[490.84s -> 493.91s]  Oh, damn it. I missed again.
[498.28s -> 506.26s]  Oh my god, I'm just grabbing you with my radar. No, he grabbed me. Did I just bounce off his head? I did.
[509.24s -> 520.68s]  That's fine. I'll just launch you like that. Save it. Save it. Save it. Come on. Let me- let me- he's got 128%.
[522.30s -> 528.33s]  I should get this. There it is. Come on. I did it. Yes!
[530.01s -> 532.55s]  This is too stressful.
[532.55s -> 543.32s]  Is there anything in this game that's like not as stressful as 1v1 for glory mode? Yeah, this is what I'm talking about.
[543.96s -> 546.10s]  Eight player smash.
[546.10s -> 550.34s]  Nobody knows what's really going on with their character. It's just a mess.
[551.53s -> 554.33s]  It doesn't matter who wins or loses in eight player smash.
[556.09s -> 558.65s]  It just goes in front of the screen. No, but it doesn't matter.
[559.29s -> 567.14s]  I don't even know where I am. I'm up here on the right. Jigglypuff, you're dead. Eat this.
[568.38s -> 573.56s]  If I aimed in the right direction, that would be great. There's no competitiveness here.
[575.02s -> 577.02s]  It's just Diddy Kong
[577.26s -> 579.66s]  and Mario. Flame Mario, by the way.
[582.02s -> 585.53s]  Am I gonna win? I have a chance here, guys, to win
[586.34s -> 588.82s]  against a bunch of brainless computer players.
[594.46s -> 602.15s]  Okay, it's just down to me. Nope. It's just down to me and Dark Pit. We both have pretty high health. What's going on?
[602.23s -> 605.18s]  Why am I doing that?
[605.66s -> 615.37s]  I will beat you. Yeah, get spiked. Yeah, get dumb. I won.
[616.95s -> 621.11s]  I think that qualifies as if anyone could that's watching could qualify.
[622.71s -> 628.39s]  Pac-Man eight player smash victory against all cpu players that you've made the easiest difficulty.
[628.71s -> 635.54s]  It's got to count for something. It's got to count for something, right? I mean, it's got to count for something.
[635.70s -> 643.58s]  It's got to mean it's got to count for something, right? I mean, it's got a thing, right?
[644.70s -> 647.02s]  I mean, oh, um thing, right?
[649.67s -> 651.67s]  Okay. Bye guys.
