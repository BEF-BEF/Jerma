[0.31s -> 14.95s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Germa here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[14.95s -> 23.13s]  And tonight, we're gonna be playing as... I don't know. It could be anything. It could be the Scout, it could be the Engineer, it could be the Spy.
[23.13s -> 27.13s]  You know what? We're gonna have a bet. I do this too often, so we're gonna make this interesting.
[27.13s -> 35.78s]  If I'm not playing as the Scout, the Engineer, or the Spy, then you all just won 20 Germa bucks.
[35.78s -> 38.78s]  Now, you're probably wondering, what can I do with Germa bucks?
[38.78s -> 45.78s]  Well, you can head on over to the Germa store. There's one pretty much on every corner, every Walmart that exists.
[45.78s -> 51.78s]  There's at least two Germa stores. People think it's a little excessive, but I said, I didn't think so.
[51.78s -> 54.78s]  I think there had to be a Germa store on every single corner.
[54.78s -> 58.78s]  And there's like Germa koozies in there. You can put my face on a koozie.
[58.78s -> 63.78s]  There's a mouse pad in there you can get. There's a couple of little... This is not real. I don't even know what I'm doing anymore.
[63.78s -> 69.96s]  Anyways, guys, we're gonna talk about a few things before I go completely crazy in this commentary.
[69.96s -> 74.96s]  First and foremost, this is gonna be casual commentary. As you probably could already tell, this is pretty casual.
[74.96s -> 81.96s]  I got my coffee here. I got my Razor Nostromo here, which I'm not gonna own in a couple of weeks,
[81.96s -> 84.96s]  because one of you guys is going to own this. Let me give you the story.
[84.96s -> 92.70s]  So I bought a Razor Nostromo the other day, well, like a week ago, and I can't get used to it.
[92.70s -> 97.70s]  It's advertised as a keyboard replacement for hardcore gamers.
[97.70s -> 101.70s]  Like if you play games all the time on a keyboard, and you want to get like better comfort,
[101.70s -> 106.70s]  and you want more buttons and more flexibility, it's supposed to replace this whole keyboard.
[106.70s -> 113.70s]  And according to what people have said, once you try it, you never go back, and it's like the best thing ever.
[113.70s -> 121.70s]  But I didn't really have that experience. I've been playing PC games for like almost 20 years with a keyboard and mouse.
[121.70s -> 128.70s]  And this thing was just like putting my hand into a jar of mayonnaise. I could not get used to it.
[128.70s -> 133.70s]  So one of you guys is gonna get it. So I'm gonna ship it to you. We'll exchange addresses.
[133.70s -> 138.70s]  Do not put your address in the comments section. That is a very terrible idea. Don't do that.
[138.70s -> 146.70s]  If you win, I'll pick you. How to be eligible to win is just write a comment.
[146.70s -> 153.70s]  Make sure you write razor dash so I can decipher the comments so I'm not picking random people that don't want it.
[153.70s -> 158.70s]  That's how you can be chosen, and I'll get your address, and I'll ship it to you, and you can check it out for yourself.
[158.70s -> 169.82s]  And now that that's kind of over and done with, I want to talk about TF2 in a sense, because TF2 I think does this very well.
[169.82s -> 176.06s]  And we're gonna bring up another game that just recently released, and I was actually gonna make an entire video on this game,
[176.06s -> 184.06s]  but I scratched it because I did the commentary a few times and I really couldn't get it right because I didn't want to piss anybody off
[184.06s -> 189.06s]  and I didn't want to poke and prod at a company that I actually very highly respect.
[189.06s -> 197.92s]  We'll go into that in a second, but TF2 has a fantastic free-to-play model. I think we can all agree on that.
[197.92s -> 203.92s]  The free-to-play model, the freemium way that you play TF2 is very well done.
[203.92s -> 212.92s]  You don't have to buy anything. You can just play. You can just unlock items with achievements, and you can just play, and you'll get drops.
[212.92s -> 217.92s]  And none of the things that you unlock are better than the originals. Everything has a downside.
[217.92s -> 223.92s]  Nothing is just a pure straight upgrade than anything of the defaults. We can all agree on that. It's a great model.
[223.92s -> 231.42s]  I played Plants vs. Zombies 2, and I put probably five to six hours into Plants vs. Zombies 2,
[231.42s -> 237.91s]  and I gotta say, that game's really, really heavy with the in-app purchases.
[237.91s -> 245.91s]  It really encourages you to spend a ton of money inside that app store, inside Plants vs. Zombies 2.
[245.91s -> 253.41s]  And I was kind of shocked by this because, first of all, Plants vs. Zombies 2 is not even on PC.
[253.41s -> 260.78s]  I couldn't believe that. When I found out that Plants vs. Zombies 2 was not even installable on the PC,
[260.78s -> 267.02s]  it's only on iOS, I kind of had a little freak out. I was like, why would they do that?
[267.02s -> 272.02s]  Why wouldn't you just put it out on everything at the same time? But that's really besides the point.
[272.02s -> 277.38s]  Besides that, which I don't agree with, I didn't really agree with the way that they have purchases in the game.
[277.38s -> 282.38s]  You have to buy some of the old plants that we all used to use and we all used to love.
[282.38s -> 287.62s]  It actually costs money to continue playing through the game. If you get past the first ten levels,
[287.62s -> 294.62s]  and you don't go back and grind out stars, you have to spend five dollars to even continue the campaign.
[294.62s -> 299.62s]  So at that point, it's not even really free to play. It's more so free to download.
[299.62s -> 306.62s]  And if you want to buy some stuff, then like nudge nudge, like go for it. I don't really like that model.
[306.62s -> 311.62s]  It's a fantastic game. The game is great. I love Plants vs. Zombies 2. It's a very fun game.
[311.62s -> 315.93s]  But that's just kind of like, it's like taking a cup of coffee like I got right here.
[315.93s -> 321.10s]  And you got some very delicious coffee. You got like a Dunkin' Donuts, like fresh brewed coffee.
[321.10s -> 328.10s]  You fill it up like halfway with that. And then like Burger Boy comes over and blows a fucking snot rocket in it.
[328.10s -> 332.10s]  It's like, yeah, the coffee is still good. This is still going to be like a good coffee.
[332.10s -> 338.10s]  But Burger Boy just blew a snot in here. Like I don't want to, I guess I'll drink it.
[338.10s -> 342.10s]  Like that's how I feel about Plants vs. Zombies 2.
[342.10s -> 347.66s]  And the reason why I bring up TF2, and I talked about TF2's free to play system, how I like it.
[347.66s -> 352.66s]  I think it works. And look at Dota 2. Dota 2 gives you everything for free.
[352.66s -> 356.66s]  They unlock all the champions for you. They just want you to go play.
[356.66s -> 361.66s]  And you'll end up spending money just because you like wanted to spend money in the game.
[361.66s -> 366.66s]  Now I know that I understand the argument here that you're talking about multiplayer games.
[366.66s -> 370.66s]  There's not much to a multiplayer game besides the multiplayer.
[370.66s -> 375.66s]  There is no single player campaign in TF2 or in Dota.
[375.66s -> 379.66s]  Now there is a single player campaign. That's the only thing there is to do in Plants vs. Zombies 2.
[379.66s -> 386.66s]  So it's justified that they make you buy things and spend money on things because you downloaded the game for free.
[386.66s -> 392.66s]  And you didn't give them any money at all. Whereas in a multiplayer game, eventually you might do it.
[392.66s -> 394.66s]  You might give money to a multiplayer game.
[394.66s -> 400.29s]  But the whole reason why I'm making this video is because I wanted to say this couple string of sentences
[400.29s -> 403.29s]  that I think really is a good analogy to this.
[403.29s -> 406.29s]  Analogy? Say words, Jerma, correctly, please.
[406.29s -> 409.46s]  A good analogy to this are airlines.
[409.46s -> 416.46s]  And I really don't want to see gaming and the free to play model go down the same road as the friggin' airlines.
[416.46s -> 420.46s]  And those of us that travel frequently will know exactly what I'm talking about here.
[420.46s -> 422.64s]  Once you go through security.
[422.64s -> 426.64s]  Okay, I bought my ticket. I'm ready to go through security. Let's go.
[426.64s -> 429.64s]  You go through security and you're stuck there.
[429.64s -> 433.64s]  You can't leave. You can't just like go to the TSA agent and be like,
[433.64s -> 436.64s]  hey, excuse me, can I like get out of here for like an hour and come?
[436.64s -> 441.64s]  But you can't do that. So everything in the airport is insanely expensive.
[441.64s -> 446.64s]  All the drinks, all the food, because they know you can't go anywhere else.
[447.64s -> 450.64s]  And they have you locked in the friggin' airline in the terminal.
[450.64s -> 453.64s]  So you have to spend the money or else you're just not going to get a drink today.
[453.64s -> 456.64s]  Like that. I don't want that to happen to gaming.
[456.64s -> 460.64s]  I don't want to like install a game and have a pop up window come up and say,
[460.64s -> 463.64s]  hey, thanks for installing the game. Glad you're having a ton of fun.
[463.64s -> 466.64s]  Wait like six dollars now or go fuck yourself.
[466.64s -> 469.64s]  Like I don't want that to happen.
[469.64s -> 473.07s]  And I really feel like we could be getting there soon.
[473.07s -> 475.07s]  So that's really all I want to say.
[475.07s -> 478.07s]  This is not a direct shot at PopCap because in the very beginning,
[478.07s -> 482.07s]  I said I have a lot of respect for PopCap because they make very good games.
[482.07s -> 484.44s]  But I just want to get that throw that out there,
[484.44s -> 487.44s]  throw that idea out there that I really don't want to see that happen.
[487.44s -> 489.44s]  And let me know what you think guys in the comments section.
[489.44s -> 493.44s]  If you still want to be eligible for the Razer Nostromo,
[493.44s -> 496.44s]  then with your comment about this topic,
[496.44s -> 500.44s]  just put Razer Dash and then your comment just so I can be able to know
[500.44s -> 503.44s]  that you still do want this Nostromo,
[503.44s -> 506.44s]  but you want to make a comment on this topic. That'll work too.
[506.44s -> 508.81s]  But yeah, guys, that's going to wrap it up here.
[508.81s -> 510.81s]  Thank you all so much for watching and really do appreciate it.
[510.81s -> 512.81s]  And I'll see you guys all next time.
[512.81s -> 515.81s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
