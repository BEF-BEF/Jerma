[0.31s -> 13.81s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with kind of a different commentary today. This is gonna be over
[13.81s -> 18.89s]  I'm not really sure what gameplay is gonna be in the background. I'm actually talking into a black screen right now
[18.89s -> 23.27s]  So I'm not really sure what's gonna be there, but there will be a gameplay there whatever loadout
[23.27s -> 26.63s]  I'm using whatever game it happens to be that's what I'm doing
[26.67s -> 31.13s]  But this video is gonna talk about something that I've been thinking about lately and it's a discussion video
[31.13s -> 35.03s]  So please chime in in the comment section if you have anything to add to this
[35.19s -> 37.19s]  And it's about the gaming industry
[37.83s -> 43.39s]  Plateauing and how graphics engines and gaming in general is kind of at that area
[43.55s -> 46.19s]  Where there's not a whole lot else left to do
[46.19s -> 53.17s]  There's not a whole lot else left to innovate on and we're gonna talk about some points some counterpoints as well to argue this fact
[53.17s -> 56.67s]  I'm gonna play devil's advocate to myself in a small regard
[56.67s -> 61.23s]  But first of all, let's let's bring up the fact that gaming let's talk about graphics engines first
[61.23s -> 68.67s]  So the graphics engines of yesteryear going back to like the Super Nintendo and regular Nintendo or even if you keep going back to
[68.91s -> 74.99s]  Atari we'll say I guess we'll start at Atari Atari. So you had Atari very very basic graphics engine
[74.99s -> 76.79s]  I don't know if you can even call it that either
[76.79s -> 82.67s]  There's like two blips on a screen for most of the Atari games and then you went from Atari to regular Nintendo
[82.95s -> 89.75s]  Regular Nintendo had 8-bit graphics and the change from the Atari to the NES was huge
[89.75s -> 94.83s]  It was astronomical people have never seen anything like that before ever in their entire lives
[94.83s -> 98.19s]  And the same can be said from the NES to the Super Nintendo
[98.19s -> 103.16s]  the Super Nintendo was miles ahead in technology same thing for the Sega Genesis and
[103.36s -> 107.24s]  It seems that we can keep going from generation to generation here
[107.24s -> 112.24s]  You move on to the Nintendo 64 you move on to like Sega CD and you got the Dreamcast
[112.64s -> 119.28s]  PlayStation 1 PlayStation 2 and then ps3 everything every generational jump has been an
[119.92s -> 121.92s]  astronomical change until
[122.08s -> 125.28s]  you got to the ps3 and the
[125.68s -> 132.09s]  360 when these two systems were being talked about when the 360 of 360 came out first when the 360 showed its first
[132.17s -> 136.17s]  Screenshots and showed its first gameplay demos and stuff. I I was kind of let down
[136.49s -> 141.21s]  Maybe that's because I'm a child of the 80s and I saw this whole revolution of video games
[141.29s -> 147.41s]  But the Xbox to the Xbox 360 there was a it was a jump, but it was such a tiny jump
[147.41s -> 152.49s]  It was like a little dude jumping over like a friggin candlestick. What's the guy's name? Come on?
[152.49s -> 152.93s]  Come on
[152.93s -> 158.97s]  What's the guy's name? Jack be meant Jack be nimble Jack be quick Jack jumped over the Xbox to the Xbox 360
[159.21s -> 164.52s]  That's how I felt textures looked kind of the same modeling looked kind of the same
[164.52s -> 171.84s]  It was in the same realm of graphics quality as the regular Xbox now that they're talking about the
[172.24s -> 174.24s]  Xbox 720 and the ps4
[174.68s -> 180.12s]  Are we gonna see a huge jump because guys you got to remember it's been like 10 years
[181.08s -> 187.56s]  Since we've seen anything really really innovatively huge like graphics engine wise in the last 10 years
[187.88s -> 194.84s]  That's a long time especially considering the fact that from the Atari to the Nintendo 64
[195.44s -> 197.16s]  Was like holy crap
[197.16s -> 204.94s]  You're like blowing up a nuclear bomb in changes to graphics quality and moving on to the next point here about not just the graphics
[204.94s -> 211.02s]  Quality games in general are starting to plateau. We're starting to see the same storylines rehash themselves
[211.02s -> 214.34s]  We're starting to see way too huge sequel numbers
[214.34s -> 216.62s]  What are we on Final Fantasy 75 now?
[216.62s -> 223.78s]  Like how far things gonna go before we see a really big innovation change in this industry, and I think it's happening
[223.78s -> 227.66s]  I really think it's happening guys at a much smaller level
[227.66s -> 232.86s]  I think it's happening at the indie level at the independent level because all these huge studios
[233.14s -> 236.46s]  They don't need to innovate anymore. They have all their franchises
[236.46s -> 239.54s]  They have all their ideas and they have all their things locked down
[239.70s -> 246.34s]  But it's the little developers the little independent developers that have to strive to create amazing content
[246.66s -> 248.62s]  Otherwise, they're gonna die. They're gonna die off
[248.66s -> 251.56s]  I mean how is Joe Schmoe gonna be able to make a
[251.92s -> 257.52s]  Indie platformer or an indie shooting game in his living room and be able to compete with Call of Duty or Battlefield
[257.56s -> 262.76s]  It's just impossible unless what you're making is a crazy cool new idea
[262.76s -> 270.60s]  And that's one of the reasons why I love Edmund McMillan so much is because he's an independent developer that just does such wacky stuff
[270.60s -> 273.08s]  He's always creating these new crazy things
[273.12s -> 278.88s]  We got the binding of Isaac from him Super Meat Boy Gish and he's working on a new title right now called
[279.24s -> 284.12s]  Mugenics which I cannot friggin wait for that game to come out guys because it's gonna be so cool
[284.12s -> 290.88s]  It's gonna be insane. I can't wait to play it but enough of smoking this guy's ass smoke what smoking this guy's ass
[291.52s -> 294.40s]  What am I gonna roll up his ass and smoke it? What am I talking about?
[295.04s -> 297.36s]  Tooting his horn is what I meant to say
[299.50s -> 301.06s]  Anyways
[301.10s -> 303.10s]  Without stuff like that without people like
[303.66s -> 309.38s]  Independent developers like Edmund McMillan the industry really might plateau it really might start to stagnant
[309.38s -> 314.47s]  But that's where you guys come in I'd love to hear what you have to say about this topic put it in the comment
[314.47s -> 322.31s]  Section below get a discussion going let's talk about the industry plateauing and if indie games can save us all I guess
[322.31s -> 327.99s]  That's that's the real meat potatoes point of this entire video. So thank you everybody so much for watching
[327.99s -> 331.91s]  That's gonna wrap it up here whatever game. I happen to be playing. I hope I won
[331.91s -> 335.07s]  I don't know who I the gameplay is not recorded yet
[335.07s -> 339.67s]  But I wanted to get this down and wanted to get this commentary done because I wanted to talk about it really badly
[339.95s -> 345.19s]  So well, thank you again everyone for watching. I'll see you all soon. And of course, take care everybody
