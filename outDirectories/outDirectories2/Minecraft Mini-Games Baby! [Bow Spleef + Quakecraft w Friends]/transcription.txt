[1.66s -> 7.45s]  Um, people are just spawning in here like crazy.
[7.45s -> 11.42s]  Oh my gosh, there's so many people in here.
[11.42s -> 12.86s]  Let me see if I can find you guys.
[12.86s -> 15.29s]  Oh my.
[15.29s -> 23.06s]  I feel like somebody just opened up a server for the first time and just told the White House to shout it out.
[23.06s -> 25.06s]  There's thousands of people on these servers.
[34.15s -> 36.94s]  I feel like I'm at a costume party.
[39.18s -> 41.74s]  Like, oh hey look it's Batman, or it's like a sexy nurse.
[41.74s -> 45.66s]  Is this Halloween server? This is what I feel like we're playing right now.
[45.66s -> 50.30s]  I see Link, I see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle, I see Spider-Man. I'm Deadpool right now.
[50.30s -> 53.50s]  Yeah, this is like the biggest costume party we've ever been to.
[53.50s -> 55.50s]  Jerma, where are you?
[55.50s -> 59.50s]  I see you. You, like, bearded king thing.
[59.50s -> 61.50s]  Oh, there he is, he's Jimbo.
[63.50s -> 67.50s]  I remember when we made that for you.
[67.50s -> 71.91s]  It's so dumb.
[71.91s -> 73.91s]  There's a lot of people here, man.
[73.91s -> 75.91s]  This is gonna be complete chaos.
[76.75s -> 78.75s]  There's like gonna be 24 people doing this.
[78.75s -> 80.99s]  This is gonna be awesome.
[80.99s -> 82.99s]  We're gonna insta-die.
[82.99s -> 84.99s]  I don't think this is gonna happen.
[84.99s -> 86.99s]  I might as well just shoot my feet right when the game starts.
[86.99s -> 88.99s]  Oh, here it goes!
[88.99s -> 90.99s]  What? What?
[90.99s -> 92.99s]  Now we got 15 seconds to spread out.
[92.99s -> 94.99s]  They're still spreading out!
[94.99s -> 96.99s]  You do not get a bow.
[96.99s -> 98.99s]  You don't get a bow?
[98.99s -> 100.99s]  I don't know. It looks like you're supposed to get hit.
[100.99s -> 102.99s]  Alright, it's starting in one second.
[102.99s -> 104.99s]  Oh, you do get a bow!
[105.83s -> 107.83s]  I just shot that guy in the face.
[109.83s -> 111.83s]  This guy, get away from me, dude.
[116.01s -> 118.01s]  Oh, get dropped.
[118.01s -> 120.01s]  Get elevated.
[120.01s -> 122.01s]  Hello?
[122.01s -> 124.01s]  Is my name still a different color?
[124.01s -> 126.57s]  Is my name still a different color?
[126.57s -> 128.57s]  No, it's not.
[130.57s -> 132.57s]  I'm doing what it's Alex is doing.
[132.57s -> 134.57s]  I'm looking at the ground.
[135.41s -> 137.41s]  I almost just killed myself.
[137.41s -> 139.41s]  You almost just killed yourself.
[139.41s -> 141.41s]  No, please!
[141.41s -> 143.41s]  Come here!
[143.41s -> 145.41s]  Oh, no!
[145.41s -> 147.41s]  Tino, leave me alone!
[147.41s -> 149.41s]  Tino, get away from me!
[149.41s -> 151.41s]  No!
[151.41s -> 153.41s]  Come on!
[155.41s -> 157.41s]  This guy's standing still! Get the guy that's standing still!
[157.41s -> 159.41s]  What?
[159.41s -> 161.41s]  We're the last three and then we make our own rules to finish the minigame.
[162.25s -> 164.25s]  Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't you try.
[164.25s -> 166.25s]  I'm not going to attack any of you guys until we're the only ones left.
[170.25s -> 172.25s]  It's going to be hard either way.
[172.25s -> 174.25s]  Tio, stop attacking Jerma.
[174.25s -> 176.25s]  I want to kill Jerma!
[176.25s -> 178.25s]  You can. Trust me.
[178.25s -> 180.42s]  I can't make them fall.
[180.42s -> 182.42s]  All of us go for those two in the car.
[182.42s -> 184.42s]  No!
[184.42s -> 186.42s]  I know!
[186.42s -> 188.42s]  I know.
[188.42s -> 190.42s]  Alright, I got my money.
[191.26s -> 193.26s]  But I'm going to...
[193.26s -> 195.26s]  I got my money on Tio.
[195.26s -> 197.26s]  Tio's still in this, huh?
[197.26s -> 199.26s]  Tio's riding the circumference.
[199.26s -> 201.26s]  He's going around the circle. That's a good idea.
[201.26s -> 203.26s]  Are you dead as well?
[203.26s -> 205.26s]  Oh, he's right there. Look.
[205.26s -> 207.26s]  It's just you three and then this other guy with the...
[207.26s -> 209.26s]  Real's nagging for me. Real's frozen.
[209.26s -> 211.26s]  Oh, he's gone.
[211.26s -> 213.26s]  Oh, no!
[213.26s -> 215.26s]  Oh, no!
[215.26s -> 217.26s]  That's awesome!
[217.26s -> 219.26s]  It was lagging!
[220.10s -> 226.10s]  You just teleported around in a circle and then just dropped through the center.
[228.10s -> 230.10s]  God damn it.
[230.10s -> 232.47s]  Oh!
[232.47s -> 234.47s]  Oh, it's Alex is alive. I thought he died.
[234.47s -> 237.54s]  Oh, I got one!
[237.54s -> 239.54s]  Oh, my game froze.
[239.54s -> 241.54s]  You're still there.
[241.54s -> 243.54s]  It's my time. I'm going to die.
[243.54s -> 245.54s]  No, that guy hasn't...
[245.54s -> 247.54s]  Oh, no! Please!
[247.54s -> 249.54s]  No! No!
[250.38s -> 252.38s]  He just walked off again.
[252.38s -> 254.38s]  Oh. Oh.
[254.38s -> 256.38s]  All right, it's Alex. You've got to prove your worth here.
[256.38s -> 258.38s]  Oh, we can still watch from up here?
[258.38s -> 260.38s]  Yeah. Oh, that was a pretty sick shot.
[260.38s -> 263.14s]  Oh!
[263.14s -> 265.14s]  You've got to lead him. Lead the target.
[265.14s -> 267.14s]  Oh, it just fell down!
[267.14s -> 273.31s]  Look, this guy didn't even need to do anything. He's just walking around in a circle.
[273.31s -> 275.31s]  There we go. It's on.
[275.31s -> 277.68s]  Who's going to get smoked?
[277.68s -> 280.11s]  Oh, Tio goes in with the first blood.
[280.95s -> 283.19s]  Peanut-pone.
[283.19s -> 285.19s]  Oh, Alex!
[285.19s -> 287.69s]  Where were you?
[287.69s -> 289.69s]  I was on the rafters.
[289.69s -> 291.69s]  Oh, this guy spawned camp in the stairs.
[291.69s -> 293.69s]  Oh, my God.
[293.69s -> 295.69s]  Where the hell were you?
[295.69s -> 298.12s]  Right behind you.
[298.12s -> 300.12s]  Ah, there's explosives all around me.
[300.12s -> 302.42s]  Little snake.
[302.42s -> 304.42s]  Oh, baby.
[304.42s -> 306.42s]  No, don't kill me, please.
[306.42s -> 308.79s]  I don't think so, stealth. It's nice to meet you across the map.
[308.79s -> 310.79s]  God, I feel like I'm playing like direct hit soldier right now.
[311.63s -> 313.63s]  Oh, Tio, if I had killed you from that shot, oh, my goodness.
[313.63s -> 315.63s]  The 360!
[315.63s -> 317.63s]  Get me out of there.
[317.63s -> 319.63s]  Oh, hi, Tio!
[319.63s -> 321.63s]  I did get him.
[321.63s -> 323.63s]  No, I spawned kill you from my spawn.
[323.63s -> 325.63s]  The reverse spawn kill.
[325.63s -> 327.63s]  The reverse spawn kill.
[327.63s -> 330.38s]  I always feel like somebody's behind me.
[330.38s -> 332.38s]  Check my back.
[332.38s -> 334.38s]  God damn it!
[334.38s -> 336.38s]  This music doesn't fit at all, by the way.
[336.38s -> 338.38s]  I always have music turned off.
[338.38s -> 340.38s]  It's like...
[342.38s -> 344.38s]  It's like the most peaceful music.
[344.38s -> 346.38s]  Hold on a second. I gotta turn this up.
[346.38s -> 348.94s]  Turn it up.
[348.94s -> 350.94s]  It doesn't fit at all.
[350.94s -> 352.94s]  This is pretty good, like, let's kill each other music.
[352.94s -> 354.94s]  Didn't feel like chasing you around the map.
[354.94s -> 356.94s]  I didn't feel like chasing you.
[356.94s -> 358.94s]  I got you, friend.
[358.94s -> 360.94s]  I didn't kill you with that?
[360.94s -> 362.94s]  God damn it!
[362.94s -> 364.94s]  Oh, yeah.
[364.94s -> 366.94s]  God.
[366.94s -> 368.94s]  Oh, come on now.
[368.94s -> 371.57s]  God, stealth.
[372.41s -> 374.41s]  I don't know why, but anytime I can, I jump.
[374.41s -> 376.41s]  Stealth, I'm so sorry.
[376.41s -> 378.41s]  Don't worry, I got revenge for you.
[378.41s -> 380.41s]  I just heard you, like, upset.
[380.41s -> 382.41s]  Like, in complaint.
[382.41s -> 384.41s]  I right-clicked, I was like, I probably shouldn't.
[384.41s -> 386.41s]  And I did.
[386.41s -> 388.41s]  I don't know why, but I always jump off something.
[388.41s -> 390.41s]  Very tip-top for fun.
[390.41s -> 392.41s]  I'd be a horrible tactician.
[392.41s -> 394.41s]  This is what I do.
[394.41s -> 396.41s]  And we jump off.
[396.41s -> 398.41s]  I run to the top as fast as I can.
[398.41s -> 400.41s]  And just make a leap off the top.
[401.25s -> 403.25s]  I honestly just can't believe it.
[403.25s -> 405.62s]  You can do this without installing any mods.
[405.62s -> 407.62s]  Yeah, it's completely mod-free on the user end.
[407.62s -> 409.79s]  Where is everybody?
[409.79s -> 412.16s]  What's going on here?
[412.16s -> 414.16s]  I got teleported to a different part of the map where
[414.16s -> 416.16s]  no enemies were.
[416.16s -> 418.16s]  Except for me.
[418.16s -> 420.16s]  Oh, okay, here we go.
[420.16s -> 422.16s]  Alright, alright, fine.
[422.16s -> 424.16s]  You stood still, I thought I got you.
[424.16s -> 426.16s]  No, you...
[426.16s -> 428.16s]  God!
[428.16s -> 430.16s]  I saw you pick your little cactus head up over the blocks.
[431.00s -> 433.43s]  I got you.
[433.43s -> 435.43s]  I gotta stop looking over that edge.
[435.43s -> 437.43s]  It's like the death of me.
[437.43s -> 439.43s]  Oh my god, I am gonna freak out.
[439.43s -> 441.43s]  Oh, hey!
[441.43s -> 443.43s]  Jerma and Tio, the last two people I killed,
[443.43s -> 445.43s]  returned to their crime scenes.
[445.43s -> 447.43s]  No, no!
[447.43s -> 449.43s]  Alright, I'm not dying again.
[449.43s -> 451.43s]  I'm not dying like five times in a row.
[451.43s -> 453.43s]  I'm gonna go on a spree.
[453.43s -> 455.43s]  Yeah, that's what's going on for me as well.
[455.43s -> 457.43s]  That's my plan also.
[457.43s -> 459.43s]  We're making like a little choo-choo train here.
[460.27s -> 462.27s]  Ask Tio, who I was stalking,
[462.27s -> 464.27s]  and it shoots me instead.
[464.27s -> 466.51s]  I'm going down in like the spider kingdom.
[466.51s -> 468.69s]  If you wanna meet me down in the spider kingdom,
[468.69s -> 470.69s]  you're welcome to come try.
[470.69s -> 472.69s]  Where is the spider kingdom?
[472.69s -> 474.69s]  You don't know where the spider kingdom is?
[474.69s -> 476.69s]  Oh!
[476.69s -> 478.69s]  I knew it!
[478.69s -> 480.93s]  Oh, hello!
[480.93s -> 482.93s]  Tio, why are you there?
[482.93s -> 484.93s]  I run the spider kingdom.
[484.93s -> 486.93s]  Whoa.
[486.93s -> 488.93s]  Take that, Tio!
[489.77s -> 492.78s]  Career.
[492.78s -> 495.08s]  Are you trying to tell me that that didn't...
[495.08s -> 497.08s]  Okay, I was gonna say.
[497.08s -> 499.08s]  Jumped up 360!
[499.08s -> 501.08s]  Oh! You got me!
[501.08s -> 503.08s]  And Tio gets...
[503.08s -> 505.08s]  That was a long shot.
[505.08s -> 507.32s]  Jerma!
[507.32s -> 509.32s]  I was about to kill that guy.
[509.32s -> 511.32s]  I know, it's Alex!
[511.32s -> 513.32s]  Oh! I missed twice and you still got me!
[513.32s -> 515.32s]  Who killed me from behind?
[515.32s -> 517.32s]  Oh, it was...
[517.32s -> 521.48s]  I don't even know who the hell hit me from behind.
[522.32s -> 524.32s]  Stealthy's one more point.
[524.32s -> 526.32s]  And he wins the golden cup!
[526.32s -> 528.56s]  Oh, wow.
[528.56s -> 530.56s]  It's Alex. Get down from there, you kid.
[530.56s -> 532.56s]  Oh, baby.
[532.56s -> 534.56s]  Come back, come back!
[534.56s -> 537.76s]  Somebody show me your body!
[537.76s -> 539.76s]  It's Alex, can't win.
[539.76s -> 542.83s]  Ah!
[542.83s -> 546.22s]  Is he one more?
[546.22s -> 548.22s]  No!
[548.22s -> 551.17s]  From the top turnbuckle.
[551.17s -> 553.17s]  Hi, it's Alex!
[553.17s -> 555.17s]  Hey!
[556.01s -> 558.01s]  Yay!
[558.01s -> 560.01s]  I'm so mad!
