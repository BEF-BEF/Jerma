[0.31s -> 17.50s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm gonna be playing as the Demo Knight.
[17.50s -> 26.50s]  Well, not really half Demo Knight, I guess you could call it, because I'm still using the lock and load, I'm not using the Wii booties like you typically would if you were using a strict Demo Knight setup.
[27.94s -> 35.94s]  But really though, what really is the Demo Knight? Is it just any Demoman with a sword, or do you have to have on the Wii booties, or do you have to have a shield on?
[35.94s -> 41.94s]  I would probably assume that if you're running around with a shield on, you are a Demo Knight.
[41.94s -> 48.94s]  Because really the charge mechanic and the crit you get on your melee weapon, it's, you're a Demo Knight. If you got a shield on, that's the way it is.
[50.50s -> 58.50s]  And I've actually become more accustomed to using this type of setup where you have that long range option with the lock and load or the grenade launcher.
[58.50s -> 67.50s]  Because the Wii booties, really if you think about it, all the Wii booties are gonna do for you is give you the extra 25 health and a little bit better turning accuracy.
[67.50s -> 72.50s]  But really though, it's just the 25 health that really matters in that situation.
[72.50s -> 79.50s]  So if you don't care about 25 health and there's medics on the team and you're getting overheal, it's okay to not put on the Wii booties.
[79.50s -> 83.80s]  Plus it is also going to solve a major problem that Demo Knights have.
[83.80s -> 89.80s]  After you charge somebody and you miss if they get away from you, you do absolutely nothing.
[89.80s -> 97.80s]  You run backwards or you just try and wildly mad men swing at them and a lot of times it doesn't work. Sometimes it does.
[97.80s -> 103.80s]  But this gives you an option to step back and go, okay, I'll pull out my gun if you're going to pull out your gun.
[103.80s -> 109.55s]  And it also really doesn't matter if you're going to use the default grenade launcher or you're going to use the lock and load.
[109.55s -> 118.55s]  It's just personal preference. Let's say you tell yourself, do I want to be able to spam around this corner and then charge over there and smash somebody in their skull?
[118.55s -> 125.55s]  Or do I want to sit back and try and get those direct shots, kind of like I'm doing, even though I am failing pretty miserably at it.
[125.55s -> 130.55s]  Later on in the video, I do get a couple of good direct shots, but it really is just personal preference.
[130.55s -> 137.18s]  So now I want to briefly talk about a couple of things and not about the gameplay really at all. It's going to be in the background.
[137.18s -> 144.18s]  I want to discuss a lot of you guys have a bunch of concerns about the giveaway I'm doing and I want to be very clear with this.
[144.18s -> 151.61s]  I want to clarify this to those of you that are concerned. No, I am not quitting Team Fortress 2.
[152.61s -> 156.61s]  I'm going to keep making videos on Team Fortress 2. I have plenty of backup items.
[156.61s -> 160.61s]  I have a lot of people, a lot of good friends that are willing to help me with this.
[160.61s -> 164.61s]  So do not worry about me. I'm going to be here for a long time, guys.
[164.61s -> 171.09s]  I don't think I could even if I tried. This game has a real deep clench on my heart and in my brain.
[171.09s -> 176.09s]  I love this game way too much to quit it. So nobody be concerned about that.
[176.09s -> 181.09s]  I am not going anywhere. Jerma is here forever until I'm 157 years old.
[181.09s -> 184.09s]  I'm going to keep making Team Fortress videos.
[184.09s -> 190.27s]  So now that that is out of the way, I want to talk about the Steam Workshop thing that I'm doing.
[190.27s -> 195.27s]  Like you all know, I have a modeler that is diligently working on these couple of things.
[195.27s -> 201.45s]  It is not one thing. It is multiple things and they are all for the heavy.
[201.45s -> 204.45s]  And I'm going to make sure I make this clear again. It is not a weapon.
[204.45s -> 209.45s]  It is not an item that you equip to gain stats or to shoot. It's not an item.
[209.45s -> 212.45s]  It is a hat and a miscellaneous.
[212.45s -> 217.75s]  Some of you have already started to speculate it because I think I've talked about this before.
[217.75s -> 224.75s]  But it's coming. It's great too. I wish I could just show you and tell you because I was laughing my ass off.
[224.75s -> 227.75s]  When I saw it for the first time, at least one of the items, I was dying laughing.
[227.75s -> 234.99s]  So expect more information and maybe even a few images in the next coming weeks.
[234.99s -> 236.99s]  So that's all I'm going to really say about that now.
[236.99s -> 241.99s]  But speculate away and if you already know what it is, then congratulations, you know what it is.
[241.99s -> 246.26s]  So let's talk about the gameplay for the last minute or so here.
[246.26s -> 250.43s]  Playing on upward. I think I forgot to say the map we're playing on.
[250.43s -> 257.43s]  This is defense on upward and right about now, they're coming to the last point and I'm not really doing a whole lot.
[257.43s -> 260.43s]  I'm kind of just, oh, let me shoot over here and let me shoot over there.
[260.43s -> 262.43s]  I'm not really doing anything.
[262.43s -> 268.43s]  Probably should have changed to the sticky launcher at this point and taken this off, put on the default grenade launcher.
[268.43s -> 273.43s]  But I don't do that and I end up doing pretty much nothing for the next 50 seconds.
[273.43s -> 276.61s]  To be honest, I was being a little too overconfident.
[276.61s -> 279.61s]  I was telling myself, no, I just got to get one or two kills with the eye lander.
[279.61s -> 283.61s]  Get myself with my health up, be able to run faster. That does not happen.
[283.61s -> 287.61s]  I act like a scrub for the remaining part of this video.
[287.61s -> 292.10s]  So here comes my most glorious moment in Team Fortress 2.
[292.10s -> 295.10s]  I'll make sure to slow it down because it really is.
[295.10s -> 300.10s]  You start taking notes now, guys, because I'm the biggest pro you could ever meet in your life.
[300.10s -> 303.10s]  So I turn around here, see an engineer building something.
[305.10s -> 311.39s]  So yeah, that's definitely something you want to do any time of century is right next to you.
[311.39s -> 316.34s]  Shoot it and get the blast damage killing yourself. That's a great idea.
[316.34s -> 320.34s]  So anyways, guys, this is going to be the end of the video. I go for an eye lander attempt.
[320.34s -> 324.34s]  Doesn't happen. I fall down in the pit of despair and we lose the game.
[324.34s -> 327.58s]  So thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[327.58s -> 331.99s]  And I'll see you guys all soon. So take care, everybody.
