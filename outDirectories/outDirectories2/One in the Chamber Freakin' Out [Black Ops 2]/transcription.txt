[0.31s -> 20.27s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jirba here with some more One in the Chamber, Call of Duty Black Ops 2, and away we go.
[20.27s -> 25.27s]  Oh Jesus, right off the bat I turned the corner. Oh, you bastard, he was lying on the ground.
[25.27s -> 33.87s]  I'll make a note of that. I'll make a mental note of that. You son of a bitch.
[33.87s -> 42.82s]  Something going on in this- Whoa, what the hell? That guy just teleported! That guy just teleported through my screen!
[42.82s -> 44.82s]  That guy, what the hell was that?
[44.82s -> 47.19s]  Alright, gotta get my bearings here.
[50.97s -> 52.97s]  That's a bad shot, I'm not taking that.
[52.97s -> 55.91s]  Let's find my way back downstairs.
[59.88s -> 62.44s]  They could be anywhere.
[62.44s -> 71.98s]  There's a guy up here. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come here.
[73.35s -> 78.58s]  Where the- Damn!
[78.58s -> 80.95s]  Don't shoot me!
[80.95s -> 82.95s]  Get it! No, there's another guy!
[82.95s -> 85.51s]  No, there's not. Yeah, there is!
[85.51s -> 88.63s]  Damn it! Damn it, crouch!
[88.63s -> 90.63s]  Here he comes, ready?
[90.63s -> 94.47s]  It actually worked!
[94.47s -> 98.31s]  It actually worked.
[98.31s -> 100.74s]  I can't even think.
[100.74s -> 102.74s]  Too many things going on in my brain.
[102.74s -> 106.52s]  Whoa, what the hell? I just like, panic knifed.
[106.52s -> 111.82s]  Oh boy.
[111.82s -> 114.63s]  Oh boy, oh.
[114.63s -> 118.52s]  What? He's still running.
[118.52s -> 121.34s]  The guy back here, I'm gonna try and just-
[121.34s -> 124.22s]  God, I didn't make one shot with-
[124.22s -> 127.16s]  I didn't make one shot with this freaking knife.
[127.16s -> 129.16s]  I mean, with this freaking gun.
[129.16s -> 133.51s]  I gotta- I need to- I could still win this.
[133.51s -> 138.50s]  Just gotta play smart. There's only two guys here.
[138.50s -> 141.32s]  Time to play smart. Here we go.
[141.32s -> 143.62s]  Smart German, here we go.
[143.62s -> 148.81s]  Wow, that guy's just sitting right there.
[148.81s -> 153.29s]  Oh, what do you know about that one?
[153.29s -> 160.76s]  Bastard.
[160.76s -> 162.76s]  Is that him? That's him!
[162.76s -> 165.26s]  What?
[165.26s -> 167.74s]  No! No!
[171.74s -> 175.06s]  I don't think I've played on this map yet.
[175.06s -> 177.75s]  This is one of the only ones that nobody ever plays on.
[177.75s -> 181.00s]  Maybe I have. Let's go.
[181.00s -> 189.32s]  This map is big, too. This is a big map.
[189.32s -> 194.44s]  This is gonna be tough.
[194.44s -> 197.58s]  Damn it. That guy's got a bullet.
[197.58s -> 201.48s]  Freak him out. It worked.
[201.48s -> 204.94s]  Wow. Hey, man. Whoa.
[204.94s -> 207.75s]  Big map. Big casualties.
[207.75s -> 211.27s]  I got ya. I still got ya.
[211.27s -> 214.86s]  I got ya. Whoa, a guy behind me.
[214.86s -> 218.82s]  No reason to freak out.
[218.82s -> 220.82s]  No reason to freak out. No reason to-
[220.82s -> 222.82s]  Geez! Louise!
[222.82s -> 225.64s]  Oh my goodness. People are everywhere.
[225.64s -> 227.64s]  Oh, there's a guy behind me, too.
[227.64s -> 230.82s]  Get out of my face!
[230.82s -> 233.82s]  Let's go down. I got three bullets here.
[233.82s -> 235.82s]  Just calm down, Jerma. Just calm down.
[235.82s -> 238.06s]  You don't gotta freak out.
[238.06s -> 240.06s]  You got three shots in this gun.
[240.06s -> 246.50s]  You got the upper hand. There we go.
[246.50s -> 248.94s]  See this guy right here? This guy's toast, too.
[248.94s -> 251.56s]  If I could- He's probably gonna-
[251.56s -> 253.56s]  I'm scared. I am legitimately scared to go around this corner.
[253.56s -> 258.98s]  Here's a guy right here. Come on.
[258.98s -> 261.93s]  Show yourself. Oh, this guy's doing a ring
[261.93s -> 266.28s]  around the Rosie with me.
[266.28s -> 270.31s]  Come on, man! Come on!
[270.31s -> 273.96s]  No! And he got the kill!
[273.96s -> 277.53s]  Oh!
[277.53s -> 279.53s]  Ashes, ashes. We all freakin'
[279.53s -> 282.28s]  fall down, apparently.
[282.28s -> 284.28s]  I'm gonna shoot that guy in his head
[284.28s -> 290.55s]  when I get the chance. Is anybody even over here?
[290.55s -> 293.75s]  There's only one dude. I got one life.
[293.75s -> 295.93s]  What? What is going on in this room?
[295.93s -> 297.93s]  Why are there two guys just, like, hanging out in here?
[297.93s -> 301.19s]  What the hell is going on in here?
[301.19s -> 303.62s]  What on earth-
[303.62s -> 307.46s]  What on earth is happening in this room?
[307.46s -> 309.46s]  Those two guys are just, like, sitting there
[309.46s -> 313.43s]  having tea. Alright.
[313.43s -> 317.78s]  I'm on my last life now.
[317.78s -> 321.05s]  I'm gonna die. There's one guy in here.
[321.05s -> 324.25s]  Yeah. Show your- Put your head
[324.25s -> 327.88s]  through that door. What?
[327.88s -> 330.57s]  Oh, man. Oh, man!
[330.57s -> 333.64s]  No! No! No!
[333.64s -> 335.64s]  Oh, I lose!
[335.64s -> 337.64s]  Well, not technically
[337.64s -> 339.64s]  no. Let's see. I got nine kills.
[339.64s -> 341.82s]  Yeah, nobody could pass that right now.
[341.82s -> 343.82s]  The next guy below me has three.
[343.82s -> 345.82s]  So, yeah, I'm going to win
[345.82s -> 347.82s]  this game. Let's think about one of the chamber.
[347.82s -> 349.82s]  You can kill, like, five or six
[349.82s -> 351.82s]  people in a row and then die three times in a row
[351.82s -> 354.25s]  and still win the game, so it's pretty cool.
[354.25s -> 356.49s]  Anyways, let's see how this ends. Let's go, man!
[356.49s -> 360.20s]  Hey, look, chickpeas!
[360.20s -> 363.85s]  I can't believe I died. I would have
[363.85s -> 365.85s]  been, like, 12 and 0 if I didn't screw up in one place.
[365.85s -> 367.85s]  But there was, like, two guys
[367.85s -> 369.85s]  camping in the same room. What the hell was that
[369.85s -> 372.34s]  all about? Ban them all, boot it, get them
[372.34s -> 375.86s]  out of here. Let's close it out on the cruise
[375.86s -> 379.26s]  level. Time to take a cruise.
[379.26s -> 383.42s]  Okay, we got a guy right here.
[383.42s -> 386.49s]  And we got a guy over there, too.
[386.49s -> 389.75s]  Two guys. Don't be too crazy.
[389.75s -> 392.63s]  Don't be too crazy.
[392.63s -> 396.28s]  Don't be too...
[396.28s -> 399.80s]  Why did I do that?
[399.80s -> 402.92s]  What the hell?
[402.92s -> 404.92s]  The knife went... Get up the stairs!
[404.92s -> 406.92s]  There's a guy coming up. Oh, God!
[406.92s -> 408.92s]  Oh, God! Oh, my God!
[408.92s -> 412.30s]  He's coming! No, he's not.
[412.30s -> 415.37s]  Oh, what? Come on!
[415.37s -> 417.99s]  Oh, Lord!
[417.99s -> 420.23s]  I don't know how those knives...
[420.23s -> 422.23s]  How are these knives not hitting?
[422.23s -> 424.23s]  I mean,
[424.23s -> 426.23s]  I have a three bar, but that's not
[426.23s -> 429.24s]  that bad.
[429.24s -> 431.24s]  Dude, those knives were going into, like,
[431.24s -> 433.24s]  the abyss. It's as if I wasn't even hitting
[433.24s -> 437.32s]  the button. It's alright.
[437.32s -> 439.32s]  We'll push through here. We'll push through.
[439.32s -> 442.84s]  Wow! I shouldn't even knife
[442.84s -> 446.55s]  anybody anymore.
[446.55s -> 450.71s]  I should just put the knife away.
[450.71s -> 452.71s]  Last guy, last guy, last guy.
[452.71s -> 455.14s]  Hello there!
[455.14s -> 457.45s]  Mr. Guy!
[457.45s -> 461.78s]  Moment of truth! The knife!
[461.78s -> 463.78s]  Alright, I'm gonna get this guy right now.
[463.78s -> 470.81s]  I'm not gonna use the knife.
[470.81s -> 474.71s]  Oh, it doesn't even matter.
[474.71s -> 476.71s]  The knife prevails!
[476.71s -> 479.98s]  Oh, my goodness.
[479.98s -> 481.98s]  Alright, well, that's gonna wrap it up here, guys.
[481.98s -> 483.98s]  Thank you so much for watching. I really do
[483.98s -> 485.98s]  appreciate it. And I'll see you all next time.
[485.98s -> 488.15s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
[488.15s -> 490.15s]  Connection interrupted!
