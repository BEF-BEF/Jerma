[3.45s -> 13.74s]  Hey, what is going on guys? It's Jerma here again with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[13.74s -> 21.74s]  This time I'm playing as the Engineer with the Strange Wrench, the Strange Pistol, and the Strange Frontier.
[21.74s -> 27.74s]  Justice, I am a weird bastard today. Strange everything. Break a lot of records in this gameplay.
[27.74s -> 35.35s]  I actually, let me think, I break my buildings built record, my kills record, and I think that's it.
[35.35s -> 41.35s]  But I break a couple records in this gameplay, and you're probably wondering, Jerma, these records seem like they're kind of low.
[41.35s -> 47.35s]  Well, they are kind of low. You've got to remember, when I play Team Fortress, I go all out balls to the wall.
[47.35s -> 53.35s]  I flip out, I go crazy, I go aggressive. I'm not one of those people that tries to save their own life.
[53.35s -> 59.35s]  I do really well in Team Fortress 2, but usually it's in spurts of two or three lives in a row.
[59.35s -> 67.35s]  My one life records are kind of atrocious, so if you're wondering, oh, Jerma, you only killed like 27 people in this gameplay.
[67.35s -> 73.35s]  I mean, that's really good, but that's not incredible because I'm a freak show and I go and shoot people with a shotgun
[73.35s -> 76.35s]  when I'm supposed to be at a sentry gun 10 feet behind me.
[76.35s -> 82.09s]  So this is going to be a couple of tips right here. I'm going to give you guys some dust ball tips, at least some dust ball tips.
[82.09s -> 88.09s]  Take a look at where the teleporter is right now. You want to stuff that teleporter in the corner as far back as it's going to go
[89.09s -> 94.09s]  because spam coming around this corner, demo men, soldiers launching all their projectiles.
[94.09s -> 97.09s]  There's a chance that it's going to blow anything up over here.
[97.09s -> 101.09s]  So be careful. Make sure the teleporter is all the way back stuffed in the corner.
[101.09s -> 107.26s]  The sentry and the dispenser, you don't really have to worry about too much because obviously you want the sentry gun to be pointed out,
[107.26s -> 114.26s]  shooting at people that are walking past it, and the dispenser needs to be in a place where you can get right to it right next to the sentry.
[114.26s -> 121.26s]  So don't really worry about that. As long as these two are kind of tucked behind the wall here, you should be okay because you're right here to repair it.
[121.26s -> 128.26s]  I know a lot of people like to go inside the building on the first point on defense. That's fine. I just don't like to deal with all the spam.
[128.26s -> 133.26s]  I think it's easier to stand out here and not have to worry about all the explosions and all the chaos
[133.26s -> 139.57s]  because if an Uber comes in, that sentry in the building is probably going to go down. It's just in such close quarters.
[139.57s -> 143.57s]  You come into the building and right next to you, two feet away from you is the sentry, you're going to get rid of it.
[143.57s -> 150.57s]  Spy came in and I just barely got every single thing saved, but they capped the first point, and let me tell you guys right now,
[150.57s -> 157.57s]  don't go down with the ship. I abandon it right here, I run away. Do this if you know you're going to die.
[157.57s -> 163.57s]  Don't glue yourself to the sentry. Just walk away, get back to your teammates, and get some secure position
[163.57s -> 167.57s]  because look at how many revenge crits I have right now. I have 20 revenge crits.
[167.57s -> 172.57s]  If I had stayed there and just kept whacking the sentry to try and stay, no, no, no, I can keep it up, I can do it.
[172.57s -> 177.57s]  You're not going to do it. I got news for you. It's not going to work. So just abandon the sentry.
[177.57s -> 181.74s]  If they already have the first point anyways, what's the point of you sticking around anyway? You know what I mean?
[181.74s -> 183.74s]  Just abandon. Control-alt-delete.
[183.74s -> 189.05s]  So now I just want to briefly talk about one thing to do with the revenge crits and the engineer in general.
[189.05s -> 192.05s]  Guys, especially medics. Medic, listen up. This is important.
[192.05s -> 198.29s]  So an engineer with the revenge crits, I have 19. Up close with one shot, it does 180 damage.
[198.29s -> 204.77s]  Pretty much you can kill any class in the game besides a soldier or a heavy in one shot.
[204.77s -> 210.38s]  Maybe two. See, I didn't land all the pellets right there, but I do right there. 180 damage.
[210.38s -> 213.38s]  That'll kill any class in one hit. It's unbelievable.
[213.38s -> 218.55s]  Heal your engineers. If you see the glowing bright shotgun, put the heal beam on him and walk around with him.
[218.55s -> 224.55s]  You will kill like five people guaranteed if he has more than a few shots. And he can land them.
[224.55s -> 231.86s]  Far too often I'll see engineers standing by their sentry guns with the glowing bright shotgun just doing nothing.
[231.86s -> 235.86s]  And I feel like if you start to heal those people and tell them over mic,
[235.86s -> 237.86s]  Hey, how many revenge crits do you have?
[237.86s -> 240.40s]  Oh, I got 17.
[240.40s -> 244.70s]  Hey, you want to go kill the whole team right now? It's like, it's a no brainer.
[244.70s -> 249.88s]  So I just skipped that part right there. That was me building the sentry gun and it took about 30 seconds maybe.
[249.88s -> 254.88s]  It's nothing happened. I didn't die. It was just really boring. So I didn't want to have you guys have to sit through that.
[254.88s -> 257.88s]  But killing that sniper right there, people freak out.
[257.88s -> 263.88s]  I've said this before in other gameplay commentaries that when you get hit by a crit, when you get shot in the stomach by a crit,
[263.88s -> 266.88s]  whether it's a rocket, whether it's a shotgun, doesn't matter.
[266.88s -> 270.88s]  You freak out a little bit and you go, Okay, there's crits. I got to run by.
[270.88s -> 272.88s]  Oh, by the way, one shot kill right there.
[272.88s -> 274.88s]  But you guys know what I mean, right?
[274.88s -> 279.88s]  When you see a crit screen, when a medic pops a crit screen on somebody and their weapons are glowing,
[279.88s -> 284.06s]  you immediately go, Here comes crits. I'm gonna die.
[284.06s -> 288.36s]  The same thing can be said about somebody that has a frontier justice that's glowing.
[288.36s -> 293.36s]  Even when I'm not playing engineer, I could be playing soldier or I could be playing spy.
[293.36s -> 298.36s]  And if I see the glowing shotgun, I go, Oh, shit.
[298.36s -> 301.73s]  And I either back up or I go for another target.
[301.73s -> 303.73s]  That's what goes through everybody's mind.
[303.73s -> 307.16s]  So this is the second sentry that's built to completion now.
[307.16s -> 310.16s]  Get a few kills. That spy was definitely a dead ringer.
[310.16s -> 314.16s]  You can always tell when a spy's a dead ringer when you shoot them one time from far away
[314.16s -> 317.16s]  and it does two damage, but it magically kills them.
[317.16s -> 320.16s]  So dead ringer spies, I do that too, though. Everybody does that.
[320.16s -> 321.16s]  Doesn't really matter.
[321.16s -> 327.40s]  So I got four kills on this sentry and I kind of do something really, really outrageous
[327.40s -> 332.40s]  and not recommended to most people that are playing engineer because we have this one point.
[332.40s -> 334.40s]  We only have three minutes to go.
[334.40s -> 338.40s]  And I destroy this sentry to get the crits.
[338.40s -> 341.40s]  I'm such a greedy bastard right here. You'll see. Ready?
[341.40s -> 344.40s]  Oh, this is a good idea. Yeah, let me just destroy the sentry.
[344.40s -> 348.40s]  But if you're quick enough, you can get a sentry built back to completion pretty quickly,
[348.40s -> 352.40s]  especially when I have that dispenser right there, a full level three dispenser.
[352.40s -> 354.40s]  I'm not worried about it at all.
[354.40s -> 357.40s]  Right now, I'm just curious. I want to try and look around, try and get some more kills.
[357.40s -> 362.40s]  Soldier right in his face, 180 damage. Remember how I said that before, 180.
[362.40s -> 365.70s]  Looking around, perusing, seeing if I can get a shot on somebody, get a kill.
[365.70s -> 369.70s]  I miss a few times, but I get the kill on him anyways from long range crit.
[369.70s -> 371.70s]  Guys, don't be afraid to do this.
[371.70s -> 375.70s]  If you're afraid to do this, if you think you need to stand by your sentry at all times
[375.70s -> 379.70s]  and guard it with your life, I mean, that's true.
[379.70s -> 382.70s]  But it's not true enough where you can't go have a little bit of fun.
[382.70s -> 387.70s]  Remember, a spy is going to try and backstab you and take out your sentry and all your buildings.
[387.70s -> 390.70s]  So what happens if a spy just saps all that stuff right now?
[390.70s -> 394.88s]  The map is small enough where I'm going to be able to get back to at least one or two of my buildings.
[394.88s -> 397.88s]  Preferably the dispenser or maybe even the sentry.
[397.88s -> 404.12s]  It's really not a big deal. If I'm standing here the whole time and I get backstabbed by a spy, it's all gone.
[404.12s -> 406.12s]  Everything is going to be gone.
[406.12s -> 410.30s]  So why not utilize your crits and be able to kill some people?
[410.30s -> 413.47s]  And if the stuff gets sapped, you can just turn around and deal with it.
[413.47s -> 419.71s]  Now, I would not advise this strategy on a large map like upward or bad water
[419.71s -> 423.71s]  or any situation where there's a lot of pressure on the point.
[423.71s -> 428.71s]  If there's a lot of pressure, you really do need to stand back at your sentry and make sure it stays up.
[428.71s -> 430.71s]  Make sure there's a guard for the team.
[430.71s -> 434.21s]  But in a situation like this, it's totally okay.
[434.21s -> 438.21s]  As you saw right there, I let that soldier kill the sentry.
[438.21s -> 441.21s]  I'm not trolling this team, don't worry. I'm not like a troll or anything like that.
[441.21s -> 446.21s]  I did that on purpose because I wanted the crits and I was 100% confident that I could get a level 2 up
[446.21s -> 450.21s]  at least within 10 or 12 seconds, which is what happened.
[450.21s -> 452.21s]  The sentry is now level 2.
[452.21s -> 455.21s]  I'm in a different spot right now because we only have one minute left
[455.21s -> 459.38s]  and they haven't even come close to getting onto the point, not even one time.
[459.38s -> 464.38s]  So just hanging out, shooting people with the shotgun, chilling out here, trying to get some more kills with the sentry.
[464.38s -> 467.38s]  Nothing I can really do right now besides kind of hang out with the team.
[467.38s -> 471.38s]  But in my mind, I've been alive for a long time, about 7 or 8 minutes now.
[471.38s -> 475.38s]  I haven't died yet. So I'm considering, okay, I have a lot of kills.
[475.38s -> 479.38s]  I'm trying to break these records. I knew I already broke at least one record.
[479.38s -> 481.38s]  So I come out here just trying to kill some more people.
[481.38s -> 484.38s]  I know we only have 30 seconds left for me to keep padding my record.
[484.38s -> 486.38s]  Spy comes over here and knows he's a dead ringer.
[486.38s -> 490.38s]  So I turn around when I hit the sentry and I get him right in his face.
[490.38s -> 493.38s]  Counting down now, 20 seconds left in the game.
[493.38s -> 495.38s]  We have this in the bag. They're not going to win.
[495.38s -> 497.38s]  So I want to get some more kills.
[497.38s -> 501.38s]  Foolishly come around the corner with just the regular shots and the frontier justice.
[501.38s -> 503.38s]  And I get plowed by that soldier.
[503.38s -> 507.38s]  So, didn't turn out so well, but I broke a bunch of records.
[507.38s -> 509.38s]  I thought that was really cool gameplay.
[509.38s -> 511.38s]  Three seconds left. We win the game.
[511.38s -> 514.38s]  Thanks everybody so much for watching and so much for supporting the channel.
[514.38s -> 516.38s]  I really do appreciate it.
[516.38s -> 519.38s]  I will see you all next time and take care everybody.
