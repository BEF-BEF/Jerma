[3.45s -> 14.34s]  Hey, what is going on guys? Jerma here again with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[14.34s -> 19.38s]  This time we're on CP Junction, a map that not one person plays and oh my god a pyro!
[19.38s -> 25.11s]  He's dead. I got him. Don't worry. So anyways, this is on Junction with the demo night setup
[25.11s -> 30.47s]  using the Persian Persuader, the Splendid Screen, and the Alibaba's Wii booties.
[30.47s -> 34.15s]  I love saying that, by the way. That's my favorite item in the game to say.
[34.15s -> 41.00s]  Anyways, if you are unfamiliar with this particular game type, A and B are open to capture.
[41.00s -> 45.56s]  Red Team has to stop us from capturing these points. The only way for us to win the game is
[45.56s -> 51.08s]  if we capture A and B. That's the only time that C is going to open. So watch right here,
[51.08s -> 56.52s]  B is going to get captured and I'm going to club this guy in his mouth. So we cut B, A is now open.
[56.52s -> 63.08s]  Notice how C is still locked. You have to capture A and B before C even opens. Junction is also a
[63.08s -> 68.68s]  very close quarters map. All the action happens pretty much in these connecting hallways. It's
[68.68s -> 72.76s]  pretty chaotic. It can get really ridiculous, especially when more than five or six people
[72.76s -> 78.07s]  on each team are fighting in these hallways. Regardless of all of this, though, this is still
[78.07s -> 83.75s]  a very, very fun map. One that I highly recommend that you try at least once, maybe twice if you
[83.75s -> 88.14s]  have the wherewithal. But unfortunately, you're not going to find it in any server browser or any
[88.14s -> 92.94s]  popular server because nobody really plays this map on a rotation. So try and find it, though.
[92.94s -> 97.64s]  It's fun. Anyways, watch what happens here. I turn around, this scout is trying to kill me.
[97.64s -> 101.48s]  I'm doing some dodging and weaving and so is he, so it's very, very difficult, especially playing
[101.48s -> 106.92s]  Demo Knight. Second scout comes behind me, get out of my way, buddy. I get shot right in the face.
[106.92s -> 111.72s]  But that's what you want to do as a Demo Knight. Don't run yourself into trouble. If you noticed,
[111.72s -> 116.60s]  I was going into that room, trying to get a little bit of shielding there from the walls in the room,
[116.60s -> 120.76s]  coming out, trying to go to the side that he's not on, waiting for my charge and recharge.
[120.76s -> 126.36s]  Because remember, you can only melee somebody when you have this set on, so it's very difficult
[126.36s -> 131.64s]  to do anything. Once you have your charge depleted, you're a sitting duck and you have to hide or you
[131.64s -> 136.58s]  have to try and outmaneuver people to get a kill. Charging out here into nowhere, just trying to
[136.58s -> 141.22s]  find someone to kill, and this soldier blows himself up on me. I always think that's funny
[141.22s -> 146.34s]  when that happens because the shield blocks you from blast damage, it blocks you from pyro damage,
[146.42s -> 150.26s]  pyro damage, it blocks you from fire. What the hell am I talking about? So anyways,
[150.26s -> 154.50s]  get a couple of kills right there. I get on the point. Demo Man is securing this place
[154.50s -> 161.72s]  like a, not a boss, something else, something else that's not as cliche, like a porcupine.
[161.72s -> 166.04s]  So A is now captured, almost to completion. We have pretty much the entire team on it.
[166.04s -> 172.46s]  This is where stuff gets real. This is where it hits the fan for our team, I guess you could say.
[173.02s -> 179.51s]  You'll see what happens. They get a couple of sentry guns up on C, and as you know, as a demo
[179.51s -> 184.54s]  knight, there's nothing I can do about that, and the entire team just gets suppressed. You'll see,
[184.54s -> 188.46s]  we come around the corner over here, get the kill on the soldier, and then, okay, there's some
[188.46s -> 194.54s]  sentries over there, and then watch this. It really is just like the entire cavalry just came
[194.54s -> 200.66s]  around that side. So anyways, I get myself killed right here. I get shot by another scout,
[200.66s -> 206.10s]  which is pretty much the bane of the demo knight is a scout. A good scout will always kill you,
[206.10s -> 210.66s]  in my opinion. They can just cover so much more ground than you can, the movement speed increase
[210.66s -> 215.06s]  and all that. They are just very, very difficult to deal with. I've killed a few scouts in this
[215.06s -> 219.78s]  gameplay, and I'm about to kill another one, but the point still stands that they are very,
[219.78s -> 223.86s]  very hard to deal with as a demo knight. I jump down here, you'll see I get him. He's not really
[223.86s -> 228.34s]  paying attention to me, so that's kind of why I get the kill. He got a little too close trying
[228.34s -> 232.42s]  to run around me. I end up turning at the right time and getting the kill, and this is now the
[232.42s -> 237.22s]  point where we are totally screwed, and it's very evident that we can't do a damn thing.
[237.22s -> 242.34s]  Sentry right here on this side, and there's a sentry pointed down at this side too. So as a
[242.34s -> 247.54s]  demo knight, I'm kind of sitting here going, okay, there's nothing I can do. I can't do anything.
[247.54s -> 253.14s]  The only thing I can do is protect this area and spy check or protect the medics or something.
[253.14s -> 257.22s]  There's really nothing I can do, and as you see here, I don't really do a good job protecting
[257.22s -> 262.65s]  anybody. So when you get in a situation like this, it's a good idea to change loadouts or
[262.65s -> 266.25s]  just change your class completely, because there's really nothing you can do at this point,
[266.25s -> 270.09s]  especially on a map like this when there's a lot of sentries. Sentries, you can't do anything
[270.09s -> 274.09s]  against a sentry. If you're a demo knight, you might as well just go make a sandwich and eat it
[274.09s -> 278.84s]  or something, because you're not going to kill a sentry as a demo knight. Uber Pyro comes up here,
[278.84s -> 282.52s]  and I'm going to be okay, because like I said before, the shield protects you. I think it's
[282.52s -> 287.32s]  30 or 40% fire damage reduction, so I knew I was going to be okay from that, but that heavy medic
[287.32s -> 292.97s]  Pyro got not so much of a good outcome as I did. So at this point, I'm really considering,
[292.97s -> 297.53s]  okay, it's time to do something. I'm just going to kill myself. So I just run down here, try to
[297.53s -> 302.49s]  get one more kill, get myself killed. Time to change loadouts. I equipped the sticky launcher,
[302.49s -> 308.60s]  and the beauty of doing this, guys, is you still have the wee booties and the sword equipped. Now,
[308.60s -> 312.36s]  you don't get the benefits of being able to charge at people, and you don't really become
[312.36s -> 317.72s]  a melee-oriented class anymore, but the wee booties give you plus 25 extra health, so now
[317.72s -> 323.24s]  I'm at 200 health, and the Persian Persuader allows you to collect health as ammo, so if I
[323.24s -> 328.04s]  run over ammo, I'm going to heal myself. So you're pretty much a more stocky demo man,
[328.04s -> 332.52s]  and the only real thing you're losing is the grenade launcher. Most of your kills, most of
[332.52s -> 336.78s]  the damage, most of your buildings destroyed, they're going to be with the sticky launcher.
[336.78s -> 341.58s]  Now, some people are ridiculously good with the lock and load or with the regular grenade launcher,
[341.58s -> 346.79s]  but most of your kills as a demo man are going to happen with the sticky launcher.
[346.79s -> 351.03s]  Left side is now secure, as you saw. I killed every single building that was there in about
[351.03s -> 355.91s]  two seconds. Coming out here around the corner, I get ubered, and that second century is now
[355.91s -> 361.43s]  toast as well, and I kill about four people along with it. So here we go, bang, bang, bang.
[361.43s -> 365.59s]  Everyone's now going to come to the point. Medic goes down, pull out the sword just for funs and
[365.59s -> 369.99s]  giggles. Everybody now gets on the point. This scout does not pose much of a threat at all,
[369.99s -> 374.55s]  because I have a medic with me and I'm a demo man. So anyways, here comes the entire team.
[374.55s -> 379.19s]  Everyone's on the point. We win the game. Top fragging, probably because I just killed
[379.19s -> 383.59s]  six or seven buildings in 15 seconds. So thanks, everybody, so much for watching.
[383.59s -> 387.11s]  I really do appreciate it. Take care, everyone, and I'll see you all next time.
