[0.31s -> 21.27s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with some Smite gameplay slash commentary, and tonight I'm gonna be playing as Loki, the trickster god of Thor's brother and Zeus's son.
[21.27s -> 24.45s]  I think that's right, I hope. No, Odin's son, right? Yes.
[24.45s -> 31.69s]  Well anyways, this is Smite. Again, I'm getting into this game a lot more than I did before, and I'm not exactly sure what the reason is for that.
[31.69s -> 37.69s]  I think it's just you go through those cycles of games that you play, and this is the one right now that I happen to be playing a ton of.
[37.69s -> 44.69s]  But I'm gonna talk about this game, Smite. I'm not gonna really talk about the gameplay, really. It's a 12 and 4, I think, 12 and 5.
[44.69s -> 50.69s]  It's just a couple of montage-y type clips back to back of me getting some kills, getting a double kill, and that sort of stuff.
[50.69s -> 55.69s]  But I'm gonna talk about a topic and a discussion I want to get you guys to chime in on as well in the comments section.
[55.69s -> 62.86s]  It's about what makes a game take off, and the reason why I bring this up is Smite is one of those games that's still currently in beta,
[62.86s -> 69.86s]  but it hasn't really steamrolled yet. It hasn't really taken off yet, at least as of the recording of this video.
[69.86s -> 73.86s]  It still kind of has a small community of players that are playing it currently in the beta.
[73.86s -> 78.86s]  Now when the game opens up, this could completely change. This game could be incredibly popular.
[78.86s -> 82.86s]  A lot of people will be playing it. People will be making videos and streaming it. I'm just not exactly sure.
[82.86s -> 86.86s]  But I want to get your guys' opinion on this, because I was thinking about this the other night in my bed,
[86.86s -> 88.86s]  because that's where I do all my thinking. You guys know that.
[88.86s -> 97.10s]  What makes a game take off? How do you get a game to go from a small community to an explosion of popularity?
[97.10s -> 100.10s]  And I'm gonna bring up one game in particular. It's Minecraft.
[100.10s -> 106.46s]  Minecraft was made by like one dude, or like a few handful of people in Java,
[106.46s -> 111.46s]  and the game just absolutely erupted with this crazy popularity.
[111.46s -> 114.46s]  And I think you can break it down into maybe a couple different categories.
[114.46s -> 119.70s]  And Minecraft would probably fall into this one, which is ingenuity.
[119.70s -> 124.70s]  When there is a game that comes out or something that is being developed that has been never seen before
[124.70s -> 128.70s]  and has nothing like it on the market at all, that's where people say,
[128.70s -> 134.70s]  holy crap, look at that game. You could build blocks and the whole world is like eight times the size of the Earth,
[134.70s -> 136.70s]  and I can get in the multiplayer server with my friends.
[136.70s -> 143.70s]  There's a whole lot of stuff going on in Minecraft that made it something like that has never been released ever before in the history of video games.
[143.70s -> 151.00s]  But is that all it takes? Is that all it takes to get yourself out there and to get your name noticed in the gaming industry
[151.00s -> 154.00s]  is to be able to make something that has never been seen before? I don't know.
[154.00s -> 158.00s]  And that's why I want to get your guys' opinion on this, get you guys to chime in in the conversation,
[158.00s -> 163.00s]  because I feel like there are a lot of games out there that require attention,
[163.00s -> 166.00s]  that if you don't get a chance to play them, you are losing out.
[166.00s -> 171.00s]  And they are very small, knit groups of people, and I would definitely even put Team Fortress 2 into this group.
[171.00s -> 177.00s]  As popular and as amazing as the game is, it still has a very, very, very small community,
[177.00s -> 182.00s]  and there are people that don't even know that Team Fortress 2 even exists still, that you can still play it.
[182.00s -> 188.24s]  I have a personal friend of mine that plays console, plays PC, plays everything, and he didn't even know.
[188.24s -> 194.24s]  He did not even know that Team Fortress 2 has been doing these big updates to the PC version.
[194.24s -> 199.24s]  He thought the Xbox version just came out, and oh yeah, I played it, it was fun, oh cool.
[199.24s -> 203.24s]  And he doesn't even know that the TF2 version on the PC has like a million different updates,
[203.24s -> 209.74s]  and all the crazy new maps, all the crazy new game modes, weapons, items. He was flabbergasted at that.
[209.74s -> 214.74s]  But let's move away from Team Fortress 2 and bring up the second thing that I think makes a game explode,
[214.74s -> 221.74s]  and it's ease of play. If you cannot just jump into a game and play and kind of know what you're doing
[221.74s -> 226.74s]  in the first 20 minutes or 15 minutes of you getting in the game, chances are you're going to stop playing it,
[226.74s -> 230.74s]  or you're going to say, this game is way too hard for me, it's way too ridiculous for me.
[230.74s -> 235.74s]  Perfect example right here is of Dark Souls. You guys probably saw the Dark Souls video.
[235.74s -> 241.74s]  If you haven't, I suggest you go watch it. I made a Dark Souls video, recorded the first half an hour of me playing the game,
[241.74s -> 245.74s]  and I seriously almost diarrhea'd my pants because of how hard that game is.
[245.74s -> 247.74s]  I don't even know if I'll ever play that game again.
[247.74s -> 252.74s]  I may or may not do it just for fun on a live stream or something like that, watch me rage or something,
[252.74s -> 259.10s]  but the game is so, there's so much to it, and it's so difficult, and the learning curve is pretty steep
[259.10s -> 264.10s]  that it turns off a lot of people, and I would bring Smite into this category as well.
[264.10s -> 271.10s]  But then again, you take a look at a game like League of Legends or Dota, Dota 2, those games are insanely popular.
[272.10s -> 278.28s]  They are like worldwide phenomenons. So how come, why is Smite not in that category?
[278.28s -> 283.28s]  You think of like Heroes of Newerth, you think of, like I said, Dota 2, League of Legends.
[283.28s -> 286.28s]  Why is Smite not one of those big games right now?
[286.28s -> 290.28s]  And I'm trying to figure out why, because I love this game.
[290.28s -> 295.52s]  I think this game is one of the most fun games I've played in the last year or two,
[295.52s -> 300.52s]  and when the game finally releases and it's not in beta anymore, it's completely free to play, open to the public,
[300.52s -> 303.52s]  it will get some more players and it will get some more attention,
[303.52s -> 307.52s]  but it's going to fall into that category of, like I said, Team Fortress 2,
[307.52s -> 311.52s]  and some of these games that have the really good community, small communities behind them,
[311.52s -> 315.52s]  like something like Monday Night Combat is another MOBA type game that's like this,
[315.52s -> 319.52s]  Awesome Knots is another game that's like this, but why are these games not huge?
[319.52s -> 323.52s]  Who decides that? Who's the one that makes the decisions on stuff like this?
[323.52s -> 327.52s]  Because I want to meet them and I want to say, look, dude, alright, listen, baby,
[327.52s -> 331.95s]  you've got to make this game popular because it's a fun game, dude, you've got to play this.
[331.95s -> 333.95s]  And maybe that is really all it takes.
[333.95s -> 337.95s]  Now that I really sit down and I think about it, maybe that really is all it takes.
[337.95s -> 341.95s]  It's just word of mouth telling people how much fun things are,
[341.95s -> 344.95s]  and then they get it and they get the same thing and they tell their friends and they have so much fun,
[344.95s -> 348.95s]  and that's where it all explodes from, because Minecraft, going back to Minecraft,
[348.95s -> 353.95s]  Minecraft really blew up during the YouTube breakout, when YouTube was starting to get,
[354.95s -> 358.95s]  let me rephrase that, when YouTube Gaming started to really take off,
[358.95s -> 362.95s]  people were making Minecraft videos, and then everyone started to play Minecraft
[362.95s -> 367.95s]  because they saw the Minecraft videos, they saw all these people having so much fun making creations
[367.95s -> 370.95s]  and hanging out with their friends, that's where it comes from.
[370.95s -> 374.95s]  So I guess before the video is over, I want to, of course, get your input as well
[374.95s -> 378.95s]  as to why you think games can take off and why some of them don't take off,
[378.95s -> 380.95s]  and I guess we will end it at that.
[380.95s -> 383.95s]  So again, please leave your comments in the comments section, let's keep the discussion going,
[383.95s -> 385.95s]  and thank you so much for watching, I really do appreciate it,
[385.95s -> 389.95s]  and I'll see you guys all next time, and of course, take care, everybody.
