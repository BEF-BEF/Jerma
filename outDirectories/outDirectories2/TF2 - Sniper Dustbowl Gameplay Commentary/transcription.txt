[3.45s -> 13.04s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? It's Jerma here again with a gameplay commentary.
[13.04s -> 19.04s]  This time we're playing as the Sniper, the regular Scope Sniper. No Bizarre Bargain, no Sydney Sleeper, anything like that.
[19.04s -> 26.04s]  This is just the default setup, except I'm using the Shahansha and I'm using the Darwin's Danger Shield for the extra health.
[26.04s -> 33.04s]  As you can see in the lower left-hand corner, I have 150. And I'm gonna warn you guys, this is a complete utter domination as the Sniper.
[33.04s -> 41.04s]  I get mad headshots every day, mad headshots every day. I miss a lot too, but you know, when you're in this spot on Dustbowl, this is Dustbowl by the way,
[41.04s -> 48.04s]  when you're on defense and there's not a really good Counter Sniper, you are free to do whatever you want as a Sniper.
[48.04s -> 52.04s]  As you see, I get a couple of headshots here right off the bat, except that wasn't a headshot, that was a body shot.
[52.04s -> 58.04s]  And here comes a headshot right here that I'm most proud of. It is absolutely insane. I've never been able to do this before in my life.
[58.04s -> 64.10s]  Oh my god, headshot, did you see that? I'm gonna rewind it, we gotta see that again.
[64.10s -> 72.10s]  Oh my god, I've never been able to do that, never in my life. So that's the first time that happened, I'm so glad I was recording.
[72.10s -> 78.53s]  Also, I apologize for not coming out with a video the last couple of days. I've been pretty sick guys, I had a pretty bad head cold.
[78.53s -> 83.70s]  Wasn't able to really talk that well, so I'm okay now though, don't worry, I'm fine.
[83.70s -> 91.20s]  So here's an announcement for you guys, don't expect too much out of it, but I finally came out with a Twitter account.
[91.20s -> 96.20s]  So, twitter.com slash German985, if you want to follow me, that's cool.
[96.20s -> 101.20s]  Just don't expect me to, you know, update every 45 minutes or every 20 minutes or something like that.
[101.20s -> 111.20s]  So, a lot of people were asking for me to do a Twitter, so I have a Twitter now, so you can know when I'm eating like cheeseburgers or hot dogs or whatever I end up putting on there.
[111.20s -> 115.76s]  Back to the gameplay now, let's talk about some sniper tips and tactics.
[115.76s -> 122.76s]  The only real tip I can give you as a sniper, something it took me a long time to learn, and it's how to aim properly.
[122.76s -> 127.76s]  What you should be doing, to be completely honest, let your mind go.
[127.76s -> 133.94s]  Stop thinking about where you need to place the cursor, where you need to go, who you need to pay attention to, what you should be doing.
[134.94s -> 142.24s]  Counter sniper for the win. What you need to do as a sniper is kind of let go of everything and just aim and shoot.
[142.24s -> 147.24s]  It's kind of like pitcher and catcher. If you're familiar with baseball, a pitcher doesn't aim his pitches.
[147.24s -> 152.24s]  He doesn't say, okay, that's where I want to throw my ball, I'm going to throw it right there.
[152.24s -> 155.24s]  They know what they're doing, they already have their accuracy all pinpointed and everything.
[155.24s -> 161.24s]  You don't have to think about where you're pointing the cursor, just let yourself go and take the shot.
[161.24s -> 168.24s]  That's the only real advice I can give you as a sniper is stop worrying so much about, no, I've got to be so precise and so exact.
[168.24s -> 171.24s]  Because that's what I did when I started sniping and I sucked.
[171.24s -> 176.61s]  So once I started to let go and I started to kind of get the mindset of, you know what, if I miss, I miss.
[176.61s -> 179.61s]  If not, then cool, I got a body shot or I got a headshot, I got a kill.
[179.61s -> 185.61s]  That's what really helped me as a sniper is to just kind of stop worrying about everything and freaking out about nonsense.
[185.61s -> 190.85s]  Also, I have no idea what those white horizontal lines were on the screen.
[190.85s -> 195.85s]  They didn't show up in my game, they only showed up in this one particular five second clip in FRAPS.
[195.85s -> 203.02s]  So I have no idea, if anyone knows what that was, let me know because that was kind of confusing for me.
[203.02s -> 207.20s]  So here I go toe to toe with this Pyro, he gets me with a nice flare gun shot.
[207.20s -> 212.38s]  I end up getting away, nice little quick scope shot on that Soldier coming to replenish my health.
[212.38s -> 218.38s]  Can't get the headshot on either of these two guys, but it's okay because I got plenty of people over here to shoot at.
[218.38s -> 225.38s]  Also, keep in mind guys, if you know there's a sniper, if you've been killed by the same sniper like two or three different times,
[225.38s -> 233.38s]  make sure to look over here and throw something over here at me because people are just sitting ducks over on the right hand side.
[233.38s -> 235.38s]  It's almost a guaranteed kill, nice headshot right there.
[235.38s -> 238.38s]  These people are guaranteed kills if I can get the shots.
[238.38s -> 242.38s]  And this guy's taunting right here, I was like, I didn't even get him.
[242.38s -> 245.38s]  I got the wrong person, but I got both the medics regardless.
[245.38s -> 249.38s]  So look over here, come here, look at, shoot me.
[249.38s -> 252.38s]  Will you please somebody, will somebody please shoot me?
[252.38s -> 253.62s]  Nobody does.
[253.62s -> 257.43s]  So just getting all kinds of headshots all over the place.
[257.43s -> 259.43s]  I can't even keep track anymore.
[259.43s -> 262.43s]  I keep killing people with quick scope headshots, headshot, headshot, headshot.
[262.43s -> 264.43s]  I can't even tell anymore what's going on.
[264.43s -> 269.43s]  I actually fall down, I get so into it, I fall off the cliff and I'm like, doh, whoops.
[269.43s -> 271.43s]  But it's okay because nothing ends up happening over it.
[271.43s -> 275.43s]  Less than 30 seconds left here now and they can't even get on the point.
[275.43s -> 278.43s]  They start to push a little bit, but it doesn't end up happening.
[278.43s -> 281.43s]  That spy explodes before I can even get over to him.
[281.43s -> 287.61s]  So now this is kind of just a game of let them come out and let me shoot them in the face a million times.
[287.61s -> 289.61s]  I kill like four people in a row.
[289.61s -> 292.61s]  There's one, there's two, and here comes three.
[292.61s -> 293.61s]  I believe it's the heavy.
[293.61s -> 294.61s]  Oh, I missed, but it's okay.
[294.61s -> 295.61s]  Here it is.
[295.61s -> 296.61s]  There it is as a soldier.
[296.61s -> 298.78s]  So if you see, there it is.
[298.78s -> 299.78s]  That's the end of the gameplay.
[299.78s -> 302.78s]  One more headshot to end it right here, but it doesn't kill him.
[302.78s -> 303.78s]  Yes, it does.
[303.78s -> 305.02s]  Top score, but who cares?
[305.02s -> 306.02s]  That's not what it's about.
[306.02s -> 307.02s]  Anyways, it's all about fun.
[307.02s -> 310.26s]  Thank you so much, everybody, for watching.
[310.26s -> 311.26s]  I really, really appreciate it.
[311.26s -> 315.26s]  Getting closer to 2,000 subscribers, very, very close now.
[315.26s -> 316.26s]  So we'll see what happens.
[316.26s -> 318.26s]  I'll plan something really cool for that.
[318.26s -> 319.57s]  Take care, everybody.
[319.57s -> 320.57s]  Thanks for watching.
