[0.57s -> 6.57s]  Hey, what is happening guys? Jerma here again with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[6.57s -> 10.57s]  Let's get right into this here. I'm playing as the Eternal Reward Spy.
[10.57s -> 13.57s]  If you are noticing, you're probably saying to yourself,
[13.57s -> 19.87s]  Jerma, Eternal Reward? Holy sheep crap, that's insane. I thought you were terrible with this knife.
[19.87s -> 23.87s]  And I would reply to that, yes I am actually very bad with this knife,
[23.87s -> 27.87s]  but I happen to get a couple of gameplays in a row on Viaduct.
[27.87s -> 31.87s]  This is not the Halloween event Viaduct. This is normal Viaduct.
[31.87s -> 35.87s]  And it's actually been a while since I've done my last Spy gameplay.
[35.87s -> 39.87s]  Kind of crazy seeing as how last month I think is my last Spy gameplay.
[39.87s -> 43.87s]  And I've never done an Eternal Reward gameplay. I did one.
[43.87s -> 48.42s]  I did one Eternal Reward gameplay and it was like,
[48.42s -> 52.42s]  it was just me yelling about how I hate the weapon and how I was pissed about it or something.
[52.42s -> 57.49s]  So here is a proper Eternal Reward gameplay.
[57.49s -> 59.49s]  Two of them in a row, both of them on Viaduct.
[59.49s -> 62.49s]  And there's something in the middle, something you guys might think is funny.
[62.49s -> 65.49s]  Something I just decided to do because I'm an idiot sometimes.
[65.49s -> 69.73s]  The loadout I'm going to be using is the Eternal Reward obviously.
[69.73s -> 73.73s]  The Cloak and Dagger and the Default Spy Revolver.
[73.73s -> 76.97s]  Gonna tell you what I'm doing right here, just waiting for someone to come out of spawn.
[76.97s -> 80.97s]  Someone I can get behind because right now I'm disguised as an enemy Heavy.
[80.97s -> 83.97s]  And they move very slowly so I want to get a different disguise.
[83.97s -> 85.97s]  Don't want to keep the one I have right now.
[85.97s -> 90.97s]  Swinging the knife to get the extra movement speed and I end up catching up to this Medic.
[90.97s -> 95.97s]  That's a quick tip for you, if you are currently disguised as a slow class, do this.
[95.97s -> 100.21s]  Swing the knife when you get close to somebody and make sure nobody's behind you when you do it.
[100.21s -> 105.21s]  Because this is your only means of disguising so you don't want to give yourself away too quickly.
[105.21s -> 108.21s]  Here comes a face stab right there, that's happened to me, happens to you too.
[108.21s -> 110.21s]  It sucks for all of us.
[110.21s -> 114.51s]  Currently as a Soldier right now and there's nothing I can do about this.
[114.51s -> 121.51s]  That's my biggest complaint about this knife, is the fact that I have to stay a Soldier and I have to be a slow bastard.
[121.51s -> 125.51s]  And there's nothing I can do about it besides cloak and run away.
[125.51s -> 128.69s]  So that's why I'm terrible with this knife, I never got good with it.
[128.69s -> 130.69s]  Could never really get the mechanic down.
[130.69s -> 134.69s]  I know a lot of people are really good with this knife and I give them props.
[134.69s -> 138.06s]  I commend you for being able to play with this knife.
[138.06s -> 142.06s]  Spy standing still disguised as me is always going to die.
[142.06s -> 146.06s]  Trying to help these engineers, I thought he might have been a dead ringer but it's not the case.
[146.06s -> 150.06s]  We have a flawless victory going right now, they don't stand a chance at all.
[150.06s -> 154.06s]  3 minutes on our side, less than 15 seconds to go on theirs.
[154.06s -> 157.23s]  I top frag in this gameplay and I top frag in the second one.
[157.23s -> 163.23s]  So I'm going to do a little transition here, I want to show you this absolutely ridiculous thing that I did.
[163.23s -> 164.23s]  I am so ashamed of it.
[164.23s -> 167.23s]  So we're going to play a game, it's a game show I made up.
[167.23s -> 168.66s]  And it's called...
[181.44s -> 184.44s]  Absolutely fantastic! John, tell him what he's won!
[184.44s -> 187.68s]  You've won a free subscription to this diagram.
[187.68s -> 190.68s]  It's only one issue and it tells you why you're so stupid.
[197.25s -> 199.25s]  Here we are on the second gameplay guys.
[199.25s -> 201.25s]  I can't believe I did that.
[201.25s -> 203.25s]  I really don't believe it.
[203.25s -> 208.25s]  When I do things like that, I really surprise myself at how just stupid I can really be.
[208.25s -> 212.25s]  Why would you jump off the... I don't even know, I'm not even going to begin to explain why I did that.
[212.25s -> 215.68s]  So you're probably wondering why this is starting so late.
[215.68s -> 224.68s]  It's because the other team was being spawn camped and I was literally just sitting there with the cloak and dagger doing absolutely nothing.
[224.68s -> 229.92s]  So I figured why not just skip that part, you don't want to see it anyways, it's pretty boring.
[229.92s -> 232.92s]  I managed to get behind everybody here and I get a couple of stabs.
[232.92s -> 237.92s]  Want the extra speed so I go after the soldier, what is with the soldiers for me in this gameplay?
[237.92s -> 240.92s]  I seem to only have soldier disguises.
[240.92s -> 244.16s]  Well we changed that right here, turned into a sniper.
[244.16s -> 247.16s]  Really quickly want to talk about the knife mechanics.
[247.16s -> 251.16s]  How they're interesting, how they're cool and why they can work in some situations.
[251.16s -> 257.34s]  Especially when you get yourself into a crowd of people and you have a disguise already.
[257.34s -> 259.34s]  Sometimes people don't even know what's going on.
[259.34s -> 268.34s]  I've had situations where I've seen an internal reward spy, backstab somebody, see them backstab the person and just my brain explodes.
[268.34s -> 270.34s]  I go wait, what happened, who's that?
[270.34s -> 273.64s]  Because your brain is trying to piece together what it's actually seeing.
[273.64s -> 276.64s]  Oh that's a soldier that just instantly turned into a medic.
[276.64s -> 285.88s]  It's crazy and it really works sometimes and some people can put this knife to such good use where they'll turn a corner, backstab the engineer that's next to you.
[285.88s -> 289.88s]  You turn around, see the engineer that's already been there, that's always been there.
[289.88s -> 292.88s]  And then you turn back around and get backstabbed by the same spy.
[292.88s -> 294.88s]  It's a great way to play spy.
[294.88s -> 296.88s]  I, like I said, just am not very good at it.
[296.88s -> 301.18s]  Kind of screwed up right there, but I deceived this sniper enough where I can get the backstab on him.
[301.18s -> 304.18s]  Come up here, I see a scout and I believe a pyro.
[304.18s -> 306.18s]  I get the backstabs on both of them.
[306.18s -> 309.18s]  Then I get killed, there's the one on the scout, there's the one on the pyro.
[309.18s -> 314.36s]  Turn around and a heavy medic peer is right behind me, get killed by them, can't get away in time.
[314.36s -> 316.36s]  And that is going to wrap it up here.
[316.36s -> 318.36s]  That's the end of the gameplay.
[318.36s -> 320.36s]  They get overtime, but it doesn't really matter.
[320.36s -> 321.36s]  We still win.
[321.36s -> 322.36s]  Thank you so much guys.
[322.36s -> 324.36s]  If you like this video, throw me a like.
[324.36s -> 326.36s]  I'll see you all next time.
[326.36s -> 327.36s]  Take care everybody.
