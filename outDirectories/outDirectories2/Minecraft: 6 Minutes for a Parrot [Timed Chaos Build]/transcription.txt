[0.31s -> 12.84s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here and MLC Stealth.
[12.84s -> 21.75s]  Hello. Hello. We are going to be reviving an old series we used to do called Timed Chaos Build.
[21.75s -> 26.25s]  If you don't know what this is, it's where we give ourselves a certain amount of time
[26.25s -> 31.51s]  to build an object or animal, and we have to stop when we get to the end of that time.
[31.51s -> 36.15s]  So, what are we building today, MLC Stealth? Jerma, today we are going to be building a parrot.
[36.15s -> 45.42s]  A parrot? One of those old pirate-style parrots. So, if you are ready. Oh, dude, I forgot about that.
[45.42s -> 51.66s]  It doesn't even match. Well, match it. I did. All right, well, we're going to try and build a parrot in
[51.66s -> 56.94s]  six minutes, and whatever we end up with, with is what we end up with. So, are you ready?
[56.94s -> 68.50s]  Yeah, I think so. In three, two, one. Wait, hold on. My timer messed up. Three, two, one, go.
[68.74s -> 75.78s]  Okay, parrot. How does it start? It needs feet, right? Why does he have like coal for feet?
[75.78s -> 81.72s]  Why do you have that color? Because that's the, like, it's toes. Oh, I don't have that color.
[81.72s -> 90.44s]  Oh, I got it. He's going to be huge. All right, fine. All right.
[90.44s -> 99.40s]  It has to be. And then we have to do it to the side, too. Whoops. Wait, what are you doing?
[99.40s -> 103.24s]  I'm trying to, like, continue it. Let me undo everything. All right. All right, you do the feet.
[103.24s -> 108.76s]  I'll do, I'll do the... All right, so let's do this here. Listen now. Oh, crap. I didn't do that.
[108.76s -> 114.26s]  Right. That's his leg. All right. Almost a minute has gone by. We didn't hurry this up. Oh, yeah.
[114.26s -> 121.06s]  We haven't, like, even started yet, huh? There we go. Hey, his butt's got to come out kind of far
[121.06s -> 126.44s]  because don't, like, parrots have, like, big butts with tails? I don't know. Yeah, they do.
[129.98s -> 131.90s]  So, there's going to be a green... I thought we were doing, like, a yellow parrot.
[133.78s -> 139.05s]  We are. Now, change this to red. Wait, he's green, though. Yeah, but he's green just until
[139.05s -> 143.43s]  this part. So, complete this. Wait, he's a different color? Yeah, parrots are, like, a ton
[143.43s -> 148.07s]  of different colors. Aren't they, like, tropical colored, kind of? I don't know. Yeah, they are.
[148.07s -> 152.57s]  I probably should have Googled parrot before this part. All right. No, no, no, no. Now, we have to
[152.57s -> 158.60s]  go, um, to red. This is already looking like our horse that we did first. No, it's not going to be.
[158.60s -> 164.95s]  It'll be better. Oh, no. Get it. How many... They only have two legs. Like, you need to make this
[164.95s -> 176.89s]  even. Like, it's all right. This way, too. Because here's his tail. Tail? Yeah. All right. We're
[176.89s -> 183.45s]  making Qbert right now. So, let's... All right, yellow. He's got to have a yellow, like, belly.
[183.45s -> 188.28s]  Oh, it's getting, like, dark in this area. Don't worry. I could change the time if we need it.
[193.21s -> 198.49s]  Two minutes are gone by. Oh, good. All right. Already, he's looking like a
[199.21s -> 206.86s]  pancake. Why? Gold plated. He's like... This parrot's, like, doing very well, apparently.
[208.78s -> 213.42s]  Oh, these gold plates don't mesh together very well. It doesn't make one, like, solid chunk,
[213.42s -> 220.57s]  does it? No, it doesn't. But you know what? It's too late. I think it's coming along okay.
[220.57s -> 228.36s]  This just looks like corn. Like, corn on top. He really is made out of corn.
[232.68s -> 240.06s]  No, this is going to look like an owl. Just keep building. Just keep building. We'll deal with it.
[240.06s -> 248.62s]  All right. I'll come up this way. Three minutes have almost gone by. We're halfway there.
[249.67s -> 253.19s]  We need to make his body a little bit more fat. All right. I'll deal with that. You deal with the
[253.19s -> 264.36s]  body. He's way too big. He's... What is he? He's not even anything. He's a block on top of a block.
[266.39s -> 269.51s]  We're just putting shapes together and calling it a parrot.
[270.07s -> 276.04s]  He looks... He looks like the road runner. If the road runner had, like,
[276.04s -> 280.60s]  ran... It looks like the road runner ran into a wall and, like, squished his face.
[281.82s -> 284.22s]  All right. Now that's enough of that. Now we need to stop making the head.
[287.88s -> 292.68s]  Yeah, they have heads. What is that, like, corn on the cob body?
[294.20s -> 298.62s]  We need a beak. We need to be... We need his head first.
[298.62s -> 302.30s]  It looks like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle.
[304.60s -> 308.68s]  It looks like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle coming out of a corn on the cob,
[308.68s -> 315.24s]  sitting on top of a table. This is the worst thing ever. Oh, whoa. What's going on? Saving?
[316.52s -> 320.22s]  No, we need a beak. We need a beak first. The beak has to be red.
[320.22s -> 324.15s]  Beak comes out like this, and this comes out too.
[324.15s -> 326.55s]  It's like platypus. This looks like a duck.
[328.65s -> 330.89s]  No, because we're going to give him, like, a big feathered head back here.
[331.85s -> 334.34s]  Oh, good. Glad we're doing that.
[334.34s -> 340.38s]  Four minutes and 28 seconds. Look, this is looking good. Look at that.
[340.38s -> 345.27s]  He only looks like somebody, like, threw up on their screen.
[348.23s -> 351.59s]  This is not a parrot. This is some, like, cartoon network.
[352.39s -> 355.43s]  This is a character from, like, Foster's Home for Imaginary Kids.
[358.15s -> 360.79s]  He really is a character from, like, Cartoon Network.
[362.31s -> 364.15s]  And apparently he's super saiyan right now.
[364.15s -> 368.36s]  All right, one minute left.
[368.36s -> 370.70s]  Oh, got to finish the body.
[370.70s -> 376.62s]  All right, what happened on this side of his head?
[377.42s -> 379.74s]  I got to fix up his mouth. His mouth is awful.
[381.38s -> 384.60s]  Everything about this is awful. He's not a parrot.
[384.60s -> 391.30s]  No, yes, he is. Yes, he is. He doesn't have wings. He doesn't have wings.
[391.30s -> 395.29s]  He doesn't have wings. We got to give him, like, wings. Oh, God.
[395.29s -> 398.81s]  I thought his wings are, like, a part of his body. Like, they combine.
[400.39s -> 403.58s]  He, like, retracts them so they're invisible.
[403.58s -> 408.04s]  No, not anymore. He has wings now. 30 seconds.
[408.04s -> 410.84s]  Oh, look at that, like, beautiful parakeet.
[413.06s -> 415.42s]  15 seconds. Clean it up.
[417.99s -> 419.67s]  This guy looks like he's in pain.
[420.87s -> 423.11s]  This guy is in severe physical pain.
[423.11s -> 427.19s]  Five, four, three, two, one, and there it is.
[428.54s -> 431.98s]  You touched his wings to his, like...
[434.22s -> 435.98s]  Doesn't he look like he's screaming?
[438.63s -> 441.83s]  He's just got, like, run over by a bus and he's waiting to die.
[441.83s -> 444.31s]  He seriously looks like he is screaming, like...
[445.67s -> 446.47s]  Like this hurts.
[449.75s -> 451.43s]  Look at his staircase for a back.
[452.15s -> 454.71s]  Oh, yeah, good. Awesome. Let's, like, walk up the staircase
[454.71s -> 459.42s]  that's supposed to be the parrot's back onto the creamed corn body.
[460.94s -> 463.77s]  Oh, that's so funny. Look at these eyes.
[464.81s -> 467.77s]  Okay, he's just like a normal green parrot,
[467.77s -> 470.89s]  but he's wearing, like, a yellow towel and the, like,
[470.89s -> 473.69s]  yellow woman's shower gown that they wrap around their hair.
[473.69s -> 475.85s]  Like, he just got out of the shower and he wrapped two towels,
[475.85s -> 477.53s]  one around his body, one around his hair.
[477.53s -> 478.97s]  Yeah, he just got out of the shower.
[481.43s -> 484.81s]  Oh, that's so funny. All right, so you guys are gonna give this guy a name
[484.81s -> 487.37s]  and a rating. One to ten.
[487.37s -> 492.34s]  I think the rating's gonna be pretty low for this one.
[492.34s -> 494.82s]  Lost his home for imaginary friends.
[494.82s -> 497.77s]  Oh, that's so funny.
[497.77s -> 499.85s]  All right, guys, well, thanks so much for watching
[499.85s -> 501.05s]  and we'll see you all next time.
[501.05s -> 503.77s]  And, of course, take care, everybody.
