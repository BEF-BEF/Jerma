[0.57s -> 7.37s]  Hey, what is going on, guys? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, a one-life commentary at that.
[7.37s -> 15.04s]  Gonna be playing as the Engineer tonight with the Default Jag, the Strange Frontier Justice and the Strange Pistol.
[15.04s -> 18.24s]  And before I get into any of this, do this, guys.
[18.24s -> 23.94s]  When you come out of the spawn, if you've got plenty of setup time, get one of your buildings built already out of the way.
[23.94s -> 28.24s]  Because then you can get a full Level 3 Dispenser or a full Level 3 Sentry.
[28.65s -> 33.35s]  Then you can just drag it out there, drop it down somewhere that you want it, and be fine.
[33.35s -> 39.15s]  A lot of people don't realize that just because the setup time goes down to zero, that doesn't mean anything.
[39.15s -> 46.65s]  It's gonna take the other team at least 10 to 20 seconds to get over to where your Sentry Gun even will be in the first place.
[46.65s -> 51.72s]  So it's alright if you're like, oh no, I don't want to do that because you only got like 4 seconds left on the clock.
[51.72s -> 53.63s]  Don't worry about it, you'll be fine.
[53.73s -> 60.40s]  And before we get into this gameplay, guys, I want to show you something that happened earlier when I was trying to play Sniper.
[60.40s -> 65.80s]  So I came into this gameplay, I wanted to play Sniper, I wanted to do a gameplay commentary for Sniper.
[65.80s -> 68.90s]  And look what happens right here, okay? This is ridiculous.
[68.90s -> 71.00s]  So right now, there's two Snipers right here, right?
[71.00s -> 76.20s]  And as anyone will know, it is very difficult to counter-Snipe two Snipers when they're both aiming at you.
[76.20s -> 79.80s]  So watch this. Aim down. I missed this shot, but watch right here.
[79.80s -> 83.97s]  Bang, headshot, doesn't kill him. Bang, headshot, doesn't kill him.
[83.97s -> 86.47s]  Like, wait, what happened right there? And then look at this!
[86.47s -> 88.77s]  There's four Snipers right here.
[88.77s -> 94.47s]  I was looking down the sights at a firing squad. They're all aiming at me. Look at how ridiculous that is.
[94.47s -> 97.70s]  I couldn't believe it.
[97.70s -> 102.83s]  So let's get back into the Engineer gameplay. I just thought that was insane, so...
[102.83s -> 105.53s]  Got my buildings all pretty much secured, need a teleporter.
[105.53s -> 108.63s]  Here is a tip for this spot. This is a great spot.
[108.63s -> 113.53s]  Build all your buildings back here, but leave enough room for you to fit back there.
[113.53s -> 118.53s]  It's really hard for a Spy to get back here and backstab you if you hang out back in this spot.
[118.53s -> 122.03s]  You'll see a couple of times a Spy will come back here, and he just gets screwed,
[122.03s -> 127.13s]  because they have to jump over things, they have to get really, really up in your face to be able to even get behind you.
[127.13s -> 132.63s]  But don't leave too much room, guys, because if you leave enough room for another person to fit back there,
[132.63s -> 137.03s]  you're going to get backstabbed. You want your back to be stuffed right in the back of the wall.
[137.03s -> 141.73s]  Also, make sure your teleporter is your number one priority in this type of situation,
[141.73s -> 146.93s]  because if you take a look to the right, that metal, there's 200 metal, like five feet away from me.
[146.93s -> 152.63s]  So my dispenser is not really that big of a concern. I want to get it up to level three, but that's not priority.
[152.63s -> 154.43s]  Get your teleporter up there first.
[154.43s -> 156.93s]  And here we go, here's that Spy I was talking about.
[156.93s -> 162.63s]  Notice how there's not any room back here for him to decloak and find a little situation where he can be safe.
[162.63s -> 167.23s]  He's stuffed in the back of the wall with all of us, so there's no way he's going to be able to do anything.
[167.23s -> 171.03s]  Where that situation goes really, really bad for most engineers,
[171.03s -> 178.83s]  is if that dispenser is five or six inches up from where it is right now, a good Spy will always kill you.
[178.83s -> 184.23s]  So if you are having lots of problems as an engineer getting backstabbed every single time you build a sentry,
[184.23s -> 187.23s]  or every single time you try to do something, try this technique.
[187.23s -> 189.53s]  You really want to stuff your back against a wall.
[189.53s -> 193.54s]  If you're against a wall, they can't do anything, they have to just shoot you with a gun.
[193.54s -> 196.44s]  Pretty risky move I just did right there, I pulled it off though.
[196.44s -> 201.54s]  Sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't, but I am a risky bastard, you guys all know that.
[201.54s -> 205.04s]  What I'm trying to do right here is I am the only engineer on the team.
[205.04s -> 209.84s]  So if there is no structure, no defensive structure right there, they will just cap it with no problem.
[209.84s -> 213.74s]  Looks like they were going to cap it, so I brought it over there, want to try and get some defense on it.
[213.74s -> 217.54s]  It does a little bit of work, but you can't really be in two places at the same time.
[217.54s -> 221.41s]  I'm trying to be two engineers, and it just doesn't work out so well.
[221.41s -> 227.75s]  Sentry goes down, but I end up with a large amount of revenge crits, and I put them to very good use.
[227.75s -> 233.35s]  Just peeking around this corner right here, making sure no demo men or soldiers were shooting any stickies across the map,
[233.35s -> 235.36s]  because sometimes that will happen.
[235.36s -> 241.66s]  Sentry ends up going down, like I said, and I got the ten revenge crits, take out this heavy medic pair with a couple of shots,
[241.66s -> 247.56s]  miss this one, but he's running away, get him right in the back, boink, get the pyro as well, doing work.
[247.56s -> 251.86s]  So this part right here is an enormous mistake, I should not have done this.
[251.86s -> 258.76s]  What I should have done is gone right back to my sentry nest, make sure I can get some ammo, make sure build another sentry to full completion.
[258.76s -> 263.26s]  Instead, I'm trying to go for some shady business here, try to drop a sentry in the tunnel.
[263.26s -> 268.46s]  Look what happens, Spy drops a sapper on my stuff, I don't end up getting there in time.
[268.46s -> 271.90s]  Major, major mistake right there, I should not have been doing that.
[271.90s -> 276.00s]  Trying to get my nest back up to square one, get a dispenser, get a sentry.
[276.00s -> 280.80s]  It's not worth it though, they are encroaching way too far on this point right now, so I say screw it,
[280.80s -> 286.10s]  I'm gonna come out here and kill some people with my revenge crits, and I get a couple of kills, get that demo man, get that Spy.
[286.10s -> 288.70s]  Not going after a heavy, that's a dumb idea.
[288.70s -> 295.20s]  End up jumping down to this little area on the right side, see a Spy freak out for a second, and then these guys just kind of go in front of me.
[295.20s -> 299.20s]  They didn't even know I was there, and at this point right now guys, I am freaking out,
[299.20s -> 303.20s]  because look it, there's only one minute left on the clock pretty much, and there's no defenses here.
[303.20s -> 307.30s]  And they start to get onto the point, and I'm just like, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, I gotta do something.
[307.30s -> 314.87s]  And it's all for naught, because I end up just dying right there, and that Spy saps the sentry, and they cap the point.
[314.87s -> 318.27s]  That is gonna be the end of the gameplay, the One Life as the Engineer.
[318.27s -> 321.47s]  Thank you so much for watching guys, I really do appreciate it.
[321.47s -> 325.57s]  If you liked this video, go ahead and shoot me a like, and I will see you all next time.
[325.57s -> 327.17s]  Take care, everybody.
