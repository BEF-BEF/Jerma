[207.74s -> 210.86s]  It does it does you have to go into one of the rocks
[213.05s -> 215.05s]  So this whole game's mechanic is based on
[215.99s -> 217.99s]  Teleporting in front of each other
[218.07s -> 220.71s]  Yeah, basically what the fuck is that?
[221.67s -> 226.63s]  Oh, yeah, let's make a game. Let's make a racing game where you just like teleport in front of each other
[227.43s -> 229.43s]  The track doesn't even matter. Look
[231.51s -> 233.91s]  Oh second place i'll be like fly in front of everybody

[281.92s -> 283.92s]  No, what the hell just what happened?
[287.06s -> 292.90s]  Uh, i'm about to win. I have a very serious question incredibly serious question this needs to be addressed
[293.92s -> 295.14s]  Why?
[295.14s -> 299.78s]  Is this game named carnage racing and not like time travel racing? Why?
[300.26s -> 306.50s]  What the fuck is the point? Why is this called carnage racing? It's not like carnage. It's time travel getting it done sugar
[308.96s -> 310.96s]  No, the game would correct itself
[320.35s -> 322.59s]  You just came
[323.23s -> 324.59s]  from
[324.59s -> 325.97s]  I
[325.97s -> 330.93s]  Wow, you're just taking all my things. You're absolutely correct. Cool. This whole game is just a series of
[331.73s -> 337.89s]  Quote what the fuck just happened. That's this whole game. Like for instance, right like what the fuck just happened
[341.04s -> 343.04s]  Yeah, yeah, come come on hit me just

[384.58s -> 387.54s]  Let me know when you're getting to the end of almost the entire race. Okay?
[388.93s -> 393.50s]  When you guys are looking at the finish line, I want you to tell me that okay
[394.46s -> 401.15s]  Okay, i'm gonna go get a drink. I'll be right back. Oh look
[401.23s -> 404.19s]  I'm having so much fun playing this video game with my friends
[405.12s -> 414.96s]  I haven't even moved one time. I looked almost done. This is a fun racing game to play
[416.38s -> 418.38s]  Especially with your friends. You should go through
[419.50s -> 421.02s]  Oh, hi

[450.98s -> 454.18s]  That's so dumb i'm done over game over we're done
[454.66s -> 457.09s]  I don't want to play this anymore
[457.09s -> 458.93s]  There's no reason to play this
[458.93s -> 463.49s]  There's no reason to play this if you guys can just if people can just do that
[463.49s -> 467.32s]  What's the point of ever playing this game ever?
