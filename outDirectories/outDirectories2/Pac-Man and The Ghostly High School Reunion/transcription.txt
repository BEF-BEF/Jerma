[0.31s -> 30.39s]  Honest to God, can somebody please go back to my other Pac-Man video and see if it's like the same music from like 15 years ago that they used again on that atrocity of a game that was Pac-Man the New Adventures 2, whatever it was?
[30.39s -> 33.65s]  I think it's the same music!
[42.21s -> 43.21s]  Who the fuck are these people?
[43.21s -> 44.21s]  Cersei!
[44.21s -> 46.09s]  Who are these people?
[46.09s -> 47.09s]  We were as fast as we could!
[47.09s -> 49.52s]  It sounded important!
[50.02s -> 51.02s]  No.
[53.02s -> 54.02s]  Why?
[54.02s -> 59.02s]  Why did they give Pac-Man the default anime main character voice?
[65.48s -> 70.73s]  Alright, who are all these characters?
[70.73s -> 73.73s]  Is there an entire world of these fucking freak shows?
[73.73s -> 81.37s]  There's an entire world of these freak show Pac-Man things.
[83.06s -> 85.06s]  Pac-Man's like in school?
[86.63s -> 88.63s]  Remember when Pac-Man went to college, guys?
[88.63s -> 89.63s]  Do you remember that?
[89.63s -> 90.63s]  That was my favorite Pac-Man.
[90.63s -> 93.63s]  Pac-Man 3, university woes.
[93.63s -> 96.06s]  Yes, Mrs. Stevenson.
[96.06s -> 97.06s]  I would like to...
[97.06s -> 98.06s]  My homework is gone.
[100.26s -> 102.26s]  Pac-Man's like 60 years old!
[102.26s -> 106.63s]  How is he in like high school or college or whatever the hell this is?
[106.63s -> 108.63s]  And what the fuck is this little thing?
[108.63s -> 110.51s]  What is that?
[112.51s -> 113.51s]  This was...
[113.51s -> 118.75s]  Why did they make up this whole world of alien characters for Pac-Man's high school reunion?
[119.25s -> 127.10s]  What is this Saturday morning cartoon?
[127.10s -> 131.59s]  Is there a new Pac-Man cartoon coming out or is there one already out?
[131.59s -> 133.59s]  This is very fishy to me.
[133.59s -> 138.59s]  I've never seen a new Pac-Man cartoon but I feel like they're trying to push a cartoon here.
[138.59s -> 140.34s]  Yeah, there is.
[140.34s -> 143.27s]  There's a new Pac-Man cartoon.
[143.27s -> 146.27s]  It apparently came out a few months ago and I've never heard of it.
[146.27s -> 148.27s]  This whole game makes more sense now.
[148.27s -> 150.27s]  This entire game makes more...
[150.27s -> 152.27s]  Let's just fucking get back to Let's Play.
[152.77s -> 157.97s]  I highly doubt I'm going to take one point of damage through this whole video.
[157.97s -> 159.66s]  I'm going to...
[159.66s -> 160.66s]  Burger.
[160.66s -> 163.73s]  They have cheeseburgers in the game?
[163.73s -> 164.73s]  It's the best game I've ever played.
[164.73s -> 166.91s]  I'd like to eat it.
[166.91s -> 170.96s]  Okay, that was harder than I should have been.
[170.96s -> 171.96s]  Alright, so here's the thing.
[171.96s -> 176.96s]  If I take one point of damage, then I will give stars $100 back.
[176.96s -> 177.96s]  Okay?
[177.96s -> 190.44s]  Alright, can we just pretend that didn't happen?
[190.44s -> 194.91s]  I gotta send it back.
[194.91s -> 195.91s]  Getting your $100 back.
[195.91s -> 198.66s]  I already spent it.
[200.04s -> 203.04s]  You'll need to collect more zucchinis to play that game.
[203.04s -> 204.04s]  Oh, what?
[204.04s -> 206.66s]  I want to play the zucchini game.
[206.66s -> 208.66s]  I want to play the zucchini simulator.
[208.66s -> 210.66s]  The most realistic zucchini simulation.
[210.66s -> 212.29s]  What about this one?
[212.29s -> 213.29s]  Come on.
[213.29s -> 216.29s]  The pineapple tank game won't work until you've collected more pineapples.
[216.29s -> 217.29s]  Oh, fuck you.
[217.29s -> 219.29s]  What about this one?
[219.29s -> 222.29s]  Oh, the lemon game won't work until you've collected 12 lemons.
[222.29s -> 224.29s]  That lemon rocket game is fun.
[224.29s -> 225.29s]  Told you.
[225.29s -> 227.29s]  But you need to collect more lemons to play it.
[227.29s -> 228.29s]  Okay.
[228.29s -> 229.29s]  Sure.
[231.18s -> 232.18s]  Shut up.
[232.18s -> 238.25s]  Oh, that ice cream game is fun, but you need to collect more ice cream cones to be able to play it.
[238.25s -> 239.25s]  Nope.
[239.25s -> 242.16s]  Actually, it's free.
[242.16s -> 247.70s]  Okay, so let's talk about avoiding enemies in this game.
[247.70s -> 252.70s]  As long as you just move a centimeter, they will not touch you.
[252.70s -> 255.70s]  Let's see just how much hit detection there is in this game.
[260.29s -> 262.17s]  Where'd he go?
[262.17s -> 263.17s]  Where did he go?
[263.17s -> 265.17s]  Did he fall off and die?
[265.17s -> 267.48s]  It's okay, ghost.
[267.48s -> 268.48s]  I've done that.
[268.98s -> 270.22s]  Jeez.
[270.22s -> 274.99s]  I have like a giant ice tongue.
[274.99s -> 277.68s]  What the hell is the point of that?
[277.68s -> 285.11s]  It's much easier just clicking X on people and them dying instantly than doing a skillshot on someone.
[285.11s -> 295.25s]  Would you like to click on them and have them auto-lock die or would you like to use skillshots in Pac-Man the New Adventure 2 that ghastly give us adventures?
[295.25s -> 298.66s]  Hi.
[298.66s -> 300.66s]  My name is Pac-Man.
[300.66s -> 304.84s]  I hope that I'm in Super Smash Brothers Brawl.
[305.34s -> 308.65s]  It's a new playable game.
[308.65s -> 309.65s]  Hi.
[309.65s -> 311.65s]  My name is Mr. Pac-Man.
[311.65s -> 312.65s]  You fucking piece of shit.
[312.65s -> 318.03s]  I'm trying to do like a bit here.
[318.03s -> 319.03s]  Hi.
[319.03s -> 321.03s]  So I'm going to say yes.
[321.03s -> 323.03s]  I'd like to meet your dentist.
[323.03s -> 324.03s]  Clyde, good to see you.
[324.03s -> 325.03s]  Look at this guy.
[325.03s -> 326.03s]  He's like perfect teeth.
[326.03s -> 327.03s]  Have I been turning invisible again?
[327.03s -> 330.55s]  Sick dentist you got.
[330.55s -> 331.55s]  Hey Clyde, what's up?
[331.55s -> 334.55s]  Hey Clyde, seeing any new Pokemon lately?
[334.55s -> 336.55s]  Because I'm Ash Ketchum.
[336.55s -> 338.36s]  Alright, I gotta get out of here.
[338.36s -> 341.36s]  I'm like freaking out that he's in school.
[341.86s -> 344.00s]  No, there he is.
[344.00s -> 345.00s]  Professor...
[345.00s -> 346.00s]  Professor Nosehair.
[346.00s -> 347.00s]  Hey, Professor Nosehair.
[347.00s -> 348.00s]  How are you?
[348.00s -> 349.00s]  Hey, Cersei.
[349.00s -> 353.33s]  Actually, maybe you should get back out there.
[353.33s -> 354.33s]  Hey, don't get...
[354.33s -> 355.33s]  Don't you scold me.
[355.33s -> 357.33s]  You're the asshole that put like the lemon...
[357.33s -> 362.33s]  The minimal lemon amount and minimal pineapple amount on the arcade machines out there.
[362.33s -> 364.33s]  You're a tyrant and a scumbag.
[364.33s -> 365.33s]  Good day.
[365.33s -> 366.95s]  No, you know what?
[366.95s -> 368.38s]  Fuck you.
[368.38s -> 371.20s]  I'm not going to keep it PG in Pac-Man.
[371.20s -> 372.20s]  What's this robot?
[372.20s -> 373.20s]  Get out of here tin can.
[373.20s -> 376.27s]  R2-D2 looking motherfucker.
[376.77s -> 377.27s]  R2-D2.
