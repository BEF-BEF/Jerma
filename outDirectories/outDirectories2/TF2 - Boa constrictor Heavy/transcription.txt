[7.74s -> 14.42s]  It's going to be like the hug heavy. Once he gets a hold of you, there ain't no I'm like a
[14.42s -> 20.74s]  fucking boa constrictor. You ever seen the Discovery Channel when the snake bites? He blew himself up
[20.74s -> 31.56s]  on me. Shit. Once I find that like hotspot, I need the melee power-up. That is so important.
[32.89s -> 37.77s]  That is more important than anything else. That guy still has crits. Okay, here's a hotspot.
[37.77s -> 45.91s]  We're at a hotspot. What's that guy got for a power-up? He's got the melee power-up. I gotta
[45.91s -> 52.78s]  kill this guy. What? I don't want the vampire power-up. No, I want the... How do I throw a
[52.78s -> 60.25s]  power-up down? Can I throw a power-up on the ground? Shit. Whatever. I got it. I got it going.
[60.81s -> 66.79s]  Let's keep the heavy boa constrictor going. I don't think I'm going to run out of things here.
[67.83s -> 73.00s]  That would have been so cool if I hit him. I'm attached to him. I got him.
[74.97s -> 87.16s]  All right, cool. This guy. See ya. Give me somebody else. That spy. I'm starting to like not
[87.16s -> 90.28s]  know what's happening right now. My brain's not like piecing together where I'm going.
[90.28s -> 103.91s]  All right. I was still attached to him. Come here. I missed. He's too fast. Holy shit. I still
[103.91s -> 119.70s]  killed him. Anybody else? Sentry gun. That's not somebody else. I'm actually not totally against
[120.34s -> 128.76s]  having this power-up, but he has it too. That's bad. We're good, but please don't die from the burn.
[128.76s -> 140.10s]  Give me that health. Do I swing faster too? No, I just move faster. This is going to be hard
[140.10s -> 149.75s]  because this guy has that power-up. All right, we're cool. Moving on down. Nope, that's bad.
[149.75s -> 168.15s]  Run him here. Get some health. I want to attach to that guy. Got him. That's not a snake. I just
[168.15s -> 175.72s]  did like a cat hiss. That's not a snake. Actually a snake. Yeah, the fucking sentry again. The same
[175.72s -> 180.09s]  fucking one.
[198.31s -> 215.82s]  Bye. That's what I wanted. That's exactly what I wanted. I'll get this heavy. You bastard. You
[215.82s -> 226.71s]  bastard. I even have the speed power-up too and I didn't even get him. I got the spy though.
[227.19s -> 243.62s]  It's okay. I'm okay with that. Oh shit. Who can I dig into now? Don't backstab me. He's looking for
[243.62s -> 257.10s]  a backstab. He could have got it too. I was attached to him. I was attached to him. Here we go.
[257.66s -> 264.15s]  Get this guy. Ready? Watch this. Watch this. Intercept him. Damn it. That was an Olympic-style
[264.15s -> 273.24s]  punch too and I missed it. I missed the opportunity. That guy's not going to die. This is where we
[273.24s -> 280.14s]  seriously start to separate the garden snakes from the king cobras. I mean, if you want to be a garden
[280.14s -> 283.34s]  snake, that's fine. You want to like grab somebody and like bite them in their toe.
[283.34s -> 289.10s]  That's all right. Whatever. For the second you start bringing in the king cobra, or the python,
[289.10s -> 298.60s]  that's me. That's who I am. This guy didn't even know. Got you. You can run, but you can't get away
[298.60s -> 309.35s]  from the fucking python. That's where we get away from the mini-sentry. Get me out of there. Let's
[309.35s -> 326.94s]  fall back to the grass. Get this guy. Gotta, come on, bite him. Bitten. Keep it going. Another one.
[326.94s -> 334.54s]  Let's get, let's get another one. This guy right here. I had him. I had him. I lost him. I lost
[334.54s -> 339.75s]  him because I like turned around. I just did like the hokey pokey. Turn myself around. That's what
[339.75s -> 347.46s]  it's all about. You just, come on, man. I need that health. This is dangerous. That was really
[347.46s -> 352.87s]  dangerous. I should not have done that. Somebody coming right now. Somebody coming right now.
[357.13s -> 362.49s]  No, I'm going to die there. I'm going to die here. Get out of there. Oh shit. Oh God.
[362.65s -> 372.82s]  Oh God. Get away from me. Get away. Up through the laundry chute. That guy's not even paying
[372.82s -> 380.71s]  attention. I'll take it. I'll take the guy not even paying attention kill. Do we have a medic?
[380.71s -> 392.68s]  I gotta latch that guy. Yeah, there's the medic. There's the medic. Medic, please help me. I'm in
[392.68s -> 407.86s]  the middle of a great snake run. If that guy, seriously. Sorry, that was a pretty good run.
[407.86s -> 418.06s]  I'll take that one. We're actually going to win? How long have I been doing this for? I feel like
[418.06s -> 434.04s]  I've been doing this for a long time. Okay, we did it. Nice work. 118. Yeah, this has been going on
[434.04s -> 447.67s]  for a long time. Had a little bit of an issue there, but I still, what the hell's going on?
[447.67s -> 456.46s]  Give me the health. You're so fast, but it don't matter, does it? You're never going to outsmart
[457.10s -> 462.36s]  the snake. I'm going to burn here. I need to keep going. Hopefully I don't burn.
[463.00s -> 476.44s]  Woo. Who's next? Oh, you next? Yeah. Keep it going. Keep it going. Gotta find someone to latch. Latch
[476.44s -> 483.45s]  on to somebody. Latch on to somebody. Pick up the health. I got the super power up. Oh, man.
[485.21s -> 496.14s]  Oh, God. Got ya. What, you want some too? Who's next? Who's in the long list of potential snake
[496.14s -> 497.26s]  bite victims?
