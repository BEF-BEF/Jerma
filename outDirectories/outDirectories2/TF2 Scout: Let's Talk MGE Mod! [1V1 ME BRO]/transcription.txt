[0.31s -> 23.47s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with the Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and today I'm going to be playing as the Scout on MGE, which is something I've never done before.
[23.47s -> 30.47s]  You've never seen an MGE video on this channel. I've never talked about MGE, but I'm going to today.
[30.47s -> 34.47s]  And why today? Why this week? Why did I decide to play on MGE?
[34.47s -> 38.97s]  It kind of has to do with the conversation me and Incredible Orb had, and Ster.
[38.97s -> 44.97s]  We were actually in Ster's apartment in Boston, just hanging out, playing games, talking about random things.
[44.97s -> 48.97s]  And TF2 came up, because Incredible Orb doesn't really play a whole lot of TF2.
[48.97s -> 55.97s]  And he just said, because everyone knows, we all know Orb's personality, he's like, you know, I would go 1v1 me, bro. I'll be able to kick your ass.
[55.97s -> 61.97s]  And that's where it kind of went from there. He said he wanted to do a 1v1 against me, and then Ster was talking about MGE.
[61.97s -> 63.97s]  We could get into a server, and we could do it.
[63.97s -> 73.97s]  So in the near future, you are probably going to see a Germa versus Incredible Orb 1v1 MGE live funny highlight type thing.
[73.97s -> 76.97s]  Not sure when that's going to happen, but it could be sometime in the next couple weeks.
[76.97s -> 81.40s]  We will go from there. But anyways, that's the initial story.
[81.40s -> 86.70s]  And it got me thinking after that. I said, man, I don't even know what it even is.
[86.70s -> 90.70s]  I know it's a 1v1. I know it's first to 10 or first to 20 or something like that.
[90.70s -> 96.70s]  And this gameplay right here that you're watching was one of the first times I even got into an MGE server.
[96.70s -> 102.70s]  And I played this guy was really, really good. This is a 1v1 Scout. I'm sure you figured that out by this point.
[102.70s -> 106.70s]  But he was really, really good. This guy was fantastic at Demoman and Soldier.
[106.70s -> 110.70s]  He was trashing on me when we were doing demo fights and Soldier fights.
[110.70s -> 113.70s]  But once we got into Scout, that's when things got really, really interesting.
[113.70s -> 117.01s]  And you can really have ups and downs.
[118.01s -> 125.01s]  There's a lot of rage moments because, man, there are a lot of people that are just way better than you when you jump into these servers.
[125.01s -> 129.01s]  It depends on the class, though. And that's why I'm saying there's a lot of ups and downs.
[129.01s -> 134.01s]  Because if you go Scout on Scout with somebody and you have a confident Scout game, you'll be doing fine.
[134.01s -> 142.01s]  But once you go against somebody that has a really good demo or really good Soldier game, you're just going to get popped around like a piece of friggin' popcorn.
[142.01s -> 148.50s]  But it is completely necessary for that to happen because that's how you improve your game.
[148.50s -> 152.50s]  You play against these really, really talented players and you watch what they do.
[152.50s -> 155.50s]  Then you start to try to emulate them, try to beat them at their own game.
[155.50s -> 165.50s]  That's how you improve. And that's what these MGE servers were pretty much intended for, was to improve your skill sets in a good 1v1 deathmatch situation.
[166.94s -> 176.94s]  So don't get discouraged if you jump in an MGE versus somebody and you get absolutely crapped on because this person's hitting every single airshot they possibly could land.
[176.94s -> 182.94s]  I remember when I first got into this game, when I first jumped in, I was doing Soldier vs. Soldier and I just said to myself,
[182.94s -> 188.94s]  Holy sheep shit. Like, this guy, I'm like negative 50,000 points right now. It's what I should be.
[188.94s -> 193.94s]  Because it was like a 0-15 match. This guy was absolutely destroying me.
[193.94s -> 201.18s]  But it got me thinking. I started saying to myself, what is this guy doing that's making him blue plate special me every time I go in the air?
[201.18s -> 208.18s]  And that's what I'm talking about. You start to analyze your game, you start to analyze their game, and eventually you can start to get a few points.
[208.18s -> 216.18s]  I think I ended the Soldier match with this guy at 20-5 or 20-4 or something, which is completely being dominated by somebody.
[216.18s -> 224.18s]  But still, I was surprised that I didn't go 20-0 or 0-20 versus this guy because he was so good.
[224.18s -> 229.54s]  And I know this is going to be asked at least a few times in the comments section, so I'm going to answer it right now.
[229.54s -> 232.54s]  Even though I've answered it, I've talked about it before, but the answer is no.
[232.54s -> 238.54s]  I am not planning on nor will I probably ever do any TF2 competitively.
[238.54s -> 242.54s]  I've talked about the reasons why. There's an entire video on that.
[242.54s -> 250.54s]  But I know that somebody will probably ask that question. So no, me playing an MGE as Scout, I'm not getting ready for Highlander Season 14.
[250.54s -> 253.54s]  I have no idea what season they're in. Somebody please correct me.
[253.54s -> 258.54s]  But I'm not getting prepared for any competitive by doing MGE.
[258.54s -> 262.54s]  Just something I wanted to try and do, of course, because me and Orb are talking about it, me, Orb, and Star.
[262.54s -> 267.54s]  Maybe Star could be like the special guest referee during this. I'm just completely throwing him under the bus right now.
[267.54s -> 271.54s]  So Star, if you're watching this, I'm sorry, but now you have to be the special guest referee.
[271.54s -> 274.98s]  Be like, I'm sorry. But anyways, guys, that's going to wrap up the video.
[274.98s -> 277.98s]  Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[277.98s -> 281.98s]  Just this quick little 1v1 MGE as Scout, and I'll see you guys all next time.
[281.98s -> 283.98s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
[283.98s -> 290.98s]  Watch out for that me and Orb MGE that's coming out fairly soon on DVD, on Disney DVD, and Blu-Ray.
[290.98s -> 291.98s]  Okay, bye.
