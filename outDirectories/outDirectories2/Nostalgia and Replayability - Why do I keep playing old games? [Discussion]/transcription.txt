[0.31s -> 13.07s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a gameplay commentary.
[13.07s -> 19.07s]  In the background of this video is going to be some Diablo 2 Lord of Destruction expansion,
[19.07s -> 24.00s]  playing with Boo or Shpoo in the game Shpee, or Boo is a Shpee.
[24.00s -> 29.00s]  But we're not going to really touch upon the gameplay at all, but we're going to talk about Diablo, kind of,
[29.00s -> 32.68s]  in a topic of discussion that I was thinking of the other day.
[32.68s -> 39.85s]  And the answer, well, not the answer, the question is, why do we go back and play games like this,
[39.85s -> 43.85s]  that we've beaten a hundred times, when we were like 13, 14, 15?
[43.85s -> 47.85s]  Like, why am I playing Diablo 2 right now? What is nostalgia?
[47.85s -> 53.85s]  And why does it get ahold of us so much? Like, how come every time I get the urge to play Diablo 2,
[53.85s -> 59.85s]  or to play like Mario RPG, or to play like Quake, or any of these old games
[59.85s -> 62.85s]  that not very many people really care about anymore.
[62.85s -> 65.85s]  Well, I guess Quake still has, you know, obviously Quake is a big thing still,
[65.85s -> 72.35s]  but something like Diablo 2, it scratches this itch for me that no other game can,
[72.35s -> 76.35s]  when I really get the urge to play it, and I don't know why.
[76.35s -> 82.35s]  There are so many games out there right now, guys, that are very good, and I'm not playing them.
[82.35s -> 87.91s]  I'm playing Diablo 2 instead, and I honestly think it has something to do with the fact that
[87.91s -> 92.91s]  when you are a kid, or not even a kid, when you're a teenager, and you're growing up a little bit.
[92.91s -> 95.91s]  Now, a lot of you guys are in this mode right now.
[95.91s -> 101.91s]  A lot of you guys watching these videos are like 12 to 17, like 12 to 18.
[101.91s -> 105.91s]  There are a lot of you guys that are older, like me, but the games that you're playing right now,
[105.91s -> 109.08s]  and in 10 years you can come back to me and say,
[109.08s -> 111.08s]  Jerma, are you a right or are you a wrong?
[111.08s -> 114.26s]  But whatever you're playing right now that you really, really love,
[115.26s -> 122.26s]  if you are in that age bracket, it is going to be that game that you will go back to all the freaking time.
[122.26s -> 127.26s]  Because right now, Diablo 2 is that game for me, because that's what I was playing when I was 13, 14, 15,
[127.26s -> 129.44s]  and I'm still playing it.
[129.44s -> 136.19s]  And I guess Diablo 2 fits into this category of infinite replayability,
[136.19s -> 140.19s]  and we'll talk about that a little bit here, because TF2 is in this as well.
[140.19s -> 145.19s]  And even some of the other popular multiplayer shooters and multiplayer games fit in this category.
[145.19s -> 150.43s]  And that category is games that are completely random.
[150.43s -> 155.97s]  No matter how many times you play the game, you will never have the exact same experience.
[155.97s -> 159.15s]  And it's games like that that will never die.
[159.15s -> 162.15s]  They will never die because of that.
[162.15s -> 166.15s]  If I load up Diablo 2 and I play a session like I'm playing with Boo,
[166.15s -> 169.15s]  we're going to have a different experience, because different stuff's going to drop.
[169.15s -> 172.15s]  The dungeon, it could be different than the last time I saw it.
[172.15s -> 174.15s]  The enemies could be randomly generated.
[174.15s -> 176.15s]  I don't know where they're going to come from.
[176.15s -> 178.15s]  It's a different experience every time.
[178.15s -> 180.15s]  Team Fortress 2 is the same way.
[180.15s -> 181.15s]  I brought up TF2.
[181.15s -> 186.15s]  When you go into TF2 on Monday, and then you go into TF2 on Thursday,
[186.15s -> 190.15s]  you're going to have a totally different experience, because the game is just so goddamn wacky
[190.15s -> 193.15s]  and has so many variables to it that it's never really the same experience.
[193.15s -> 196.15s]  You'll always get something new and have so much fun,
[196.15s -> 199.15s]  because it's not the same stuff over and over again.
[199.15s -> 201.15s]  Now, the maps could be the same.
[201.15s -> 203.39s]  The items can be the same.
[203.39s -> 209.56s]  For instance, Diablo 2's item system hasn't really changed in like 10 years or something like that.
[209.56s -> 214.56s]  But it's not about getting new content in just the same way I brought up Team Fortress 2.
[214.56s -> 218.56s]  It's the random encounters of the experience.
[218.56s -> 220.56s]  When you play TF2, we've all been in situations like this,
[220.56s -> 224.56s]  where you pull out the halves of Toichi like you saw the video a couple days ago,
[224.56s -> 227.56s]  and I killed like seven people in eight seconds.
[227.56s -> 231.56s]  That will never happen again unless the planets align correctly for me.
[231.56s -> 234.56s]  So it's situations like that, what I'm talking about.
[234.56s -> 237.56s]  Another one, for instance, for example, is GTA.
[237.56s -> 241.56s]  How many times have you been in GTA and seen something and gone,
[241.56s -> 244.56s]  oh my god, that was ridiculous.
[244.56s -> 246.56s]  That'll never happen ever again.
[246.56s -> 252.24s]  And when a game has those moments happen so often, you can never get sick of them.
[252.24s -> 255.24s]  You will never get sick of that game because you're always looking forward
[255.24s -> 258.24s]  to the next ridiculous thing that's going to happen.
[258.24s -> 262.73s]  And I opened on nostalgia, and I guess I'll close on nostalgia as well.
[262.73s -> 269.04s]  The whole purpose of this video has been me explaining why I think nostalgia exists for me at least,
[269.04s -> 271.04s]  and it's because of replayability.
[271.04s -> 273.04s]  But sometimes it's not.
[273.04s -> 275.04s]  Sometimes it's really not the case.
[275.04s -> 278.21s]  Sometimes you just have an emotional connection to a game,
[278.21s -> 281.21s]  and a lot of you guys know that one for me is The Neverhood,
[281.21s -> 282.21s]  and we all have that game.
[282.21s -> 285.21s]  We all have that thing that we love that we all pay that much attention to.
[285.21s -> 288.21s]  And it's awesome because ArmaKrog, the spiritual successor,
[288.21s -> 292.21s]  the Kickstarter thing I talked about, just got funded successfully by,
[292.21s -> 296.21s]  I think it got like an extra $100,000 on top of what they wanted for their goal.
[296.21s -> 298.71s]  So that's really, really awesome to hear that.
[298.71s -> 303.71s]  I'm so glad I'm going to get to play the spiritual sequel in quotes to The Neverhood.
[303.71s -> 305.71s]  It's going to be a blast.
[305.71s -> 307.71s]  But ending this video, I'm going to wrap it up here, guys.
[307.71s -> 308.71s]  Thank you all so much for watching.
[308.71s -> 316.43s]  If you have anything to add, then by all means put it in the comments section, guys.
[316.43s -> 318.43s]  I'd love to hear what you guys have to say.
[318.43s -> 320.43s]  Talking about nostalgia, talking about replayability,
[320.43s -> 323.43s]  talking about why you can play the same game over and over again.
[323.43s -> 327.43s]  Your reasons, they might not be other people's reasons, but whatever.
[327.43s -> 330.43s]  We all have our own reasons for everything.
[330.43s -> 331.43s]  So thank you guys so much for watching.
[331.43s -> 333.43s]  I really do appreciate it, and I'll see you guys all next time.
[333.43s -> 336.43s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
