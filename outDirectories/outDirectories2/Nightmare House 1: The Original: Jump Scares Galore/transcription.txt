[0.31s -> 18.76s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with Nightmare House 1. It's the actual prologue to Nightmare House 2, and I did it sort of in reverse.
[18.76s -> 27.76s]  I did Nightmare House 2 before I did Nightmare House 1, and that's my mistake, but I did promise I was going to do this. I did promise I was going to do the prologue.
[27.76s -> 34.94s]  So let's wrap up Nightmare House 2, the playthrough, totally, I guess, with Nightmare House 1. Prologue, here we go.
[34.94s -> 43.63s]  I heard this is very, very scary. I heard there's a lot of moments in the prologue or in Nightmare House 1 where you crap your pants.
[43.63s -> 49.58s]  So let's see if I crap my pants. Currently at the loading screen.
[55.97s -> 66.38s]  Uh oh. Nightmare House 2 will start after finishing the prologue. Okay. This is going to be real scary.
[66.38s -> 89.55s]  All right. The prologue. Oh man. Oh boy. Birds. This is very dark. I might turn up the brightness just a little bit because I can't see anything. Brightness.
[89.55s -> 100.59s]  Right there should be better. Hey, it's still pretty dark, but a little bit better. Let's just go here. In the woods.
[100.59s -> 113.34s]  Over the hills and through the woods to grandmother's house we go. Look at that house. It's a nightmare house.
[113.34s -> 127.98s]  Okay. Blood at the door. Anything around here? Bottle. Get out of here. Table. You know what? Let's wreck this guy's whole picnic table.
[127.98s -> 140.29s]  Oh, that's all I can do. Get out of the way. Can I open this up? No. Uh, door will not open. That's okay.
[140.29s -> 154.65s]  Whoever lives here, you are a freak. What's that? A bulkhead? Can I open the bulkhead? No, it's locked. I can't do anything with this house. This nightmare house.
[154.65s -> 163.53s]  Let's, uh, can I go around? Hmm. Maybe there's a way to break it. Can I like break that for the shovel or something?
[163.53s -> 171.66s]  Break it. Open the doors and smash the window. Oh, smash the window. Smash the window. Give me something to smash the window with.
[171.66s -> 187.06s]  Oh, that's not gonna work. I can see inside, but I cannot get in. Come with me. What about the shed? Let's go check out the shanty.
[187.06s -> 203.10s]  Anything? Hey, the shed opens. There's an axe. A bike. I'm gonna ride my bike out of here. Give me the axe.
[203.10s -> 212.04s]  Why can't I take the table saw? I'd rather have the table saw. I could probably just break the door down now.
[212.04s -> 228.08s]  Actually, you know what? I'm gonna go for the lock. Lock seems like the sure thing. And... Yay! Door! Hello? Hey!
[228.08s -> 236.05s]  Do I have a flashlight? Okay, good to know that you have a flashlight in this one as well as the second one. Good to know.
[236.05s -> 246.46s]  Let's move along here. Electric. I'm assuming I'm gonna get hurt if I touch that. Go! Nope. Oh, it's all water.
[246.46s -> 256.77s]  I'm gonna electrocute if I stand on that. Jump! Alright, let's go tub. Let's go move the tub.
[258.84s -> 275.21s]  Hey, dude. Are you okay? Are you okay, sir? You don't look okay. Got a gun. Break some of these crates. Let's get the hell out of here.
[275.21s -> 286.62s]  Door opens. Now this just comes back out to the electricity room. Can I jump this? I thought the guy was gone.
[286.62s -> 299.86s]  Move this thing. Get out of the way. Oh, I think I know what to do. I gotta make like a quasi bridge. That didn't work.
[299.86s -> 309.30s]  Come here. You go right here, and you get over here. And you go right here. Is that gonna do it? Is that gonna work?
[309.30s -> 321.01s]  Ah! Physics! I don't know how you work! I die! Come here. Get over here. Oh my god, maybe this is not what you're supposed to do.
[321.01s -> 331.52s]  I can't see any other way though, so I'm gonna say yes it is. Hey, look at that! No, don't fall over. Yes, it worked! I made it!
[331.52s -> 340.21s]  Door won't open. Of course the door won't open. Why would the door open?
[345.79s -> 357.44s]  No, that's not the way. Secret room. Secret room. Where am I supposed to go? Maybe out to the back here? To the door, maybe?
[357.44s -> 365.93s]  I'm gonna try my block building routine again, because I think I saw something up there. Is that gonna work?
[365.93s -> 381.32s]  And support my weight! Yay! Oh, hooray! This is what I just looked at. What is this? Oh, hello! Guy sitting on the toilet is now not a guy on the toilet.
[381.32s -> 390.66s]  It's two guys. Kinda looks like an egg. Got my flashlight still, right? Anything in here I need to know? Turn on the water, clean my hands.
[390.66s -> 400.03s]  No, I knew it! I knew it! I knew you were gonna do that! Why am I kneeling? I was just kneeling, like just swinging at him. Now it'll open, right?
[401.27s -> 409.62s]  There's another one right here, no? I thought his legs were gonna get up instead of attacking me. Anything in here? Bullets.
[409.62s -> 424.40s]  Oh, this one is so scary because it's just confined rooms. It's like hallways. Storage. Can I move this? Don't think I can. Can I open this door?
[424.40s -> 443.38s]  This door looks like it's already kind of ajar. No, I don't know. Open. Can I break? Maybe I can just break this. No, I can't. That's good to know. Good to know.
[443.38s -> 455.86s]  You got anything in your cabinets, lady? Hey! Hey! Whoa! Oh, I thought someone broke in the door. Okay, the lights out. Lights out. It's curfew.
[462.79s -> 466.97s]  Blood. Recharge flashlight. Lots of blood. Lots of blood. Lots of blood.
[471.11s -> 476.67s]  Get the hell away from me, you son of a sneaky snake! Get away from me!
[477.67s -> 486.31s]  Oh, TV. What's on the TV? Anything interesting? Come on. That eye just looked at me.
[486.31s -> 494.18s]  Gah! I want to watch like Spongebob Squarepants. Do you got that on your TV? Do you have cable?
[494.18s -> 503.03s]  Alright, we're gonna go, I'm gonna go in here to pick, there's probably stuff in here. There is a, what the hell is this thing?
[503.03s -> 512.10s]  Is this like an incubator? Are you making like chickens? Are you gonna hatch like little chickens? Bullets. Good to have bullets. It's always good to have bullets.
[514.42s -> 521.44s]  This is the only way to go. He's in here. Let's go. Come on now! Come on! Don't do this to me!
[525.46s -> 543.64s]  Charge the light. Hey! Where am I? Where the hell am I? What is going on? Hey, weird house you got here, dude.
[543.64s -> 553.58s]  Your house is like a bunch of bricks. I fell down. Alright, well let's just do it again.
[553.58s -> 562.71s]  We're right here. That's cool. Land on... I'm stuck. I'm stuck! Why am I stuck? You, get out of my face!
[562.71s -> 570.41s]  Thank you for getting out of my face. I appreciate that. Now why could I not land on that? Did I mess something up? Let's see, hold on.
[570.41s -> 591.92s]  Got a board over there. And can I just jump from here? Hey, I can! Excuse me, miss. Um, there seems to be a problem here.
[591.92s -> 601.30s]  It looks like this guy is dead on your wall and you're just sitting there watching TV. Oh, I don't want to walk over near her.
[602.30s -> 608.40s]  Slow down, sequence. What you got for me, huh? You gonna run? You gonna run? That guy's gonna chase me.
[608.40s -> 618.85s]  Garen? Oh, she wasn't even watching TV. Who can I... Oh! My dog is barking at me right now. Did you guys hear that?
[618.85s -> 629.50s]  He was like, Ruff! Get me in! Get me out of... Why are you doing this, lady? Why are you scaring me so much?
[629.50s -> 642.74s]  Through the next door. It's locked. Gag! Come on! She's just always standing in front of you.
[642.74s -> 653.01s]  Come on! That's a two-piece! Something in my eye. Something in my nose. Something all over me. Can I break this?
[653.01s -> 667.38s]  Give me that shotgun. Oh! Shotgun, baby! Overconfidence! I just got... Good! What is that?
[667.38s -> 675.72s]  Alright, I'm keeping the shotgun out. I don't care how many bullets I waste. No one is coming near me.
[675.72s -> 687.96s]  Charge the light. Let's go. God! God! He's... Double shoot! Double barrel! This is just a jump-mania game.
[687.96s -> 698.04s]  Everybody just jumps in your face. Got this girl jumping in my face. These guys with the broken necks jumping in my face.
[698.04s -> 711.50s]  Guys on the ground. Holy hell in a hand basket. Is he dead? He's dead. Come on! Hide somebody around every corner.
[711.50s -> 726.84s]  Keys? Any keys? Hey, a key! Give it to me. I want that key. Give me that key. Hey, can I pick it up?
[726.84s -> 739.41s]  Hey, I can pick it up. Hooray! Get... These guys are so creepy. Just these grotesque freak shows.
[739.41s -> 748.86s]  Let's go, key man. There we go. Open the door. Get me out of... Let me guess. The stairs are going to fall down. Hooray!
[748.86s -> 760.75s]  No, they didn't. Oh, it opened. Where's my shotgun? I'm only comfortable when I have the shotgun out.
[760.75s -> 778.34s]  Charge the light. Another door. Open. Get me out of here. God, this is gross. Oh, you're moving. You're rocking. That's not terrifying.
[778.34s -> 793.47s]  Hey! Get me out of that room. Get me out of that room. Get me out of here. I just keep hearing noises. Get me out.
[793.47s -> 803.61s]  Get away from me, you crawling... What's in there? Nothing? Nothing. Got to go in here. I'm okay with that.
[803.61s -> 813.65s]  Break down the walls. Break them down. It's going to be a jump. I will make this jump. Here we go. Jump, master!
[813.65s -> 827.88s]  Bullets. And... A ladder. I can't move. Can I break that stuff? Oh! I thought that was a person. I thought that chair...
[827.88s -> 847.42s]  Oh, it actually was a person. Never mind. Really? Shoot him! Shoot him! Get me up off of here. Will you get off me?
[847.42s -> 860.81s]  Why can't I get out of here? I'm stuck on this ladder. I fell down. Oh, well, that was dumb. I was glitched out on the ladder. I couldn't get off.
[860.81s -> 870.26s]  Alright, this time I'm going to be ready for this guy that was side swiping me when I climbed up the ladder. Yeah, you're dead, bro. Let's go.
[870.26s -> 882.50s]  Get off me. Hey, my whole job is to sit up here and... I almost just got scared again from that. Get out of here! Okay, go.
[882.50s -> 892.12s]  Okay, we're good. We're good. We're good. We're good. Load up that shotgun. Open the door. Something's going to break through the walls. Something's going to break through the walls.
[892.12s -> 907.47s]  Just run everywhere. Too many. Too many. No more shotgun bolts. Should I go down? What was in the room across the hall? Might as well look.
[907.47s -> 923.48s]  Let's bar it up. Can't get in there. Only one option. Looks like we're going to have to take it. Down. Going down, down, down.
[924.48s -> 934.44s]  Oh, that one hurt. That one hurt my brain. That and that one. Damn it!
[934.44s -> 949.99s]  I thought I got better at these scare games. I got worse. Hey, Komodo, come over here like Quasimodo. Eat that. Eat that.
[949.99s -> 966.70s]  I only have two shots in this. Not anymore. 20 now. We're good. Charge it. You have to do that. She has to just appear randomly. Did I like escape the house? I think I did.
[966.70s -> 975.97s]  Get me out of here. Take me down like the King's Road. Game of Thrones reference. That was a Game of Thrones reference.
[975.97s -> 983.21s]  Who's going to combat me and get shot in the face with the shotgun? A lot of people here. What's going on? Maybe I should just be running.
[983.21s -> 1002.54s]  Oh, I have a sprint. I forgot about that. Oh my God. Look, it's a light. Hey, it's a truck. Ah! You can't escape from Nightmare House. Oh my God.
[1002.54s -> 1018.58s]  Well, that's it, I guess, for Nightmare House 1. Now, if you were watching this right now and you didn't see any of the Nightmare House 2 stuff, I'm going to put a link in the description to start off at Chapter 1 for Nightmare House 2.
[1018.58s -> 1027.58s]  I suggest you watch through that playthrough. It was very, very fun, very, very interesting. And yeah, that's going to wrap it up, guys. I will see you guys all soon. And take care, everybody.
