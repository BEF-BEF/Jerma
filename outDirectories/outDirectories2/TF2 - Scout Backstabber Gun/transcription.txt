[4.47s -> 12.31s]  Hey, what is going on everybody Jerma here with the new scout weapon the backscatter or the spy scout backstab gun
[12.71s -> 18.15s]  Also going to be using in this video the cloak device for the scout and the jumpy jump melee
[18.23s -> 22.71s]  So if you put all these together you kind of just turn into a spy and here you go
[24.62s -> 26.62s]  If there is ever a place where this
[26.62s -> 29.42s]  Should shine it's probably right here
[30.12s -> 33.40s]  Once they push the card up a little bit to like right about here
[33.72s -> 39.78s]  Is when I could be able to come in and get at least a couple of backstabs just like a spy
[41.10s -> 47.50s]  Well, you know what? We'll get this guy too because we can you know, why not but i'm gonna burn here
[47.50s -> 50.62s]  Where do I know so i'm not worth it. I'm committed to this
[51.02s -> 54.71s]  I'm not going anywhere and I don't want to drink the bonk. I will take the burn damage
[55.03s -> 59.99s]  Because it's important that they get on this card right now like right now. Okay, here we go. Here we go
[60.07s -> 62.31s]  This no, you know, you don't don't kill him leave him alone
[62.55s -> 66.31s]  This is this is where we slowly just go like this and just kill this guy
[66.87s -> 73.40s]  Okay, good good good good backstab good job i'll get out no don't get out bring this guy no
[74.12s -> 76.46s]  You ruined my plan. My plan was to
[77.34s -> 85.19s]  All right, everybody we're getting up on this guy. Nice job. Okay, we're back to square one. I'm not spotted yet
[85.98s -> 88.78s]  This pyro is looking for spies. So he's looking for me
[89.78s -> 91.78s]  Not turning your back now, are you?
[92.90s -> 94.71s]  Oh
[94.71s -> 98.47s]  I probably would have got that kill anyways if I had just shot him with the regular scatter gun
[99.64s -> 100.52s]  Hey
[100.52s -> 108.39s]  You're under arrest for backstabbing my friend. Okay, I need the health and
[109.11s -> 117.06s]  Back to square one use the jumpy jump. Make sure nobody sees you good good
[118.71s -> 120.39s]  Now we
[120.39s -> 122.34s]  We wait
[122.34s -> 127.14s]  Oh, i've been spotted. Oh, i've been spotted but he can't get up here unless he goes all the way around
[128.49s -> 130.49s]  He's gonna go all the way around and he's gonna die
[132.22s -> 133.74s]  Hey
[133.74s -> 141.11s]  Get out of here. This guy's trying to come up. I've gone gone. See he doesn't even know i'm there. I made it out alive
[142.39s -> 152.30s]  Here's my new spot. Here's my new spot waiting for this heavy. There he is. Got him. Got him. All right. Watch out soldier
[152.30s -> 154.50s]  Watch out. Watch out

[167.99s -> 169.91s]  And he died
[169.91s -> 171.19s]  No
[171.19s -> 172.63s]  No
[172.63s -> 174.31s]  No, don't ruin this
[174.31s -> 176.31s]  Me and the scout. No shit

[190.15s -> 195.70s]  God damn it
[195.70s -> 202.41s]  You are not me and you are gonna get back stabbed and so is this guy?
[202.81s -> 209.24s]  Okay, that's two the one thing I will say when you use the bonk nobody ever like pays attention to you
[209.96s -> 212.12s]  Nobody ever like wants to know if you're still around
[213.27s -> 216.95s]  It's crazy, right? Like I feel like I am a spy scout
[217.66s -> 219.27s]  Because of the bonk
[219.27s -> 221.83s]  Check this out. See he knows I exist
[222.76s -> 228.41s]  He's gonna forget I ever existed. All I have to do is come back here. I'm using my dead ringer right now
[228.41s -> 238.65s]  I just use the dead ringer. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. What is why a pyro is just appearing in front of me

[260.57s -> 266.04s]  Be sneaky enough where I can get somebody from behind, you know the best place
[266.04s -> 269.91s]  You know what screw your teleporter you guys are gonna have to walk now
[270.86s -> 277.67s]  You're gonna have to walk and once you start walking and that's when you're gonna get back stabbed by the spy scouts. Bye

[289.94s -> 292.47s]  God, come on. Let me get that one hit on them. Let me
[296.71s -> 297.19s]  All right

[305.51s -> 308.39s]  If you threw them in the air half the time they would do what he just did
[308.63s -> 314.12s]  The soldier just turned into one of those right there. That was insane. All right. Well anyways
[316.14s -> 319.66s]  Am I gonna be able to do anything up here or is this guy coming for me? You're gonna come for me?
