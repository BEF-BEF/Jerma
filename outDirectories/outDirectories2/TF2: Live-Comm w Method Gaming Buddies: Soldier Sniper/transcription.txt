[0.31s -> 13.25s]  Hey, what's going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[13.25s -> 17.73s]  This is going to be a live commentary though. It's going to be a live commentary with four
[17.73s -> 22.49s]  people. Just messing around, having a good time with the guys from Method Gaming, Pwnstar,
[22.49s -> 28.13s]  MLC Stealth and Enad. Playing as the Soldier and then the Sniper in the next gameplay.
[28.13s -> 31.84s]  Two pretty good gameplays. I probably could have done normal commentaries on them. So
[31.84s -> 42.12s]  enjoy everybody. The live commentary will be kicking in right now.
[65.12s -> 76.93s]  I'm dead. What are you talking about? Oh my God. That's a Spy. That's a Spy. I'm so scared
[76.93s -> 82.73s]  right now. Get away from me. Is it us three against Enad? No, Pwn. We're on the same
[82.73s -> 90.77s]  team. What are you talking about? I think you need to... Oh my God. Oh my God. That's
[90.77s -> 97.69s]  a lot of people. All right. Let's get a quick cap here. Quick cap. Oh, I died. I'm going
[97.69s -> 107.05s]  for gold here. Jerma rocking it out with 10 points. I don't believe in you. All word
[107.05s -> 113.68s]  I'm in trade says Pwn. The word of the day is all word. We got anybody coming up this
[113.68s -> 119.58s]  little hallway here? We do. Oh jeez. Somebody just gave me five crates. Is that you right
[119.60s -> 128.10s]  there, Enad? No. What the fuck is this? Oh my God. Sure, let's just sit in the corner.
[128.10s -> 134.26s]  Is that you fucking camping? You little bitch. You were all crotch down, nuts sitting there.
[134.26s -> 141.54s]  Were you fishing or something? I'm on a pyro. You were like casually sitting there too, man.
[141.54s -> 145.62s]  Like you had some beef jerky and beer on the side. You were fucking making... That's called
[145.62s -> 152.62s]  like camping. That wasn't camping. Who camps in Team Fortress 2? I call it strategic waiting.
[152.62s -> 158.72s]  Strategic waiting. Okay. Hey, what's the rule? Sitting in the same spot for 30 seconds? I
[158.72s -> 163.56s]  was only there for like four, five. Bullshit. Yeah, it's the same thing like when a fucking
[163.56s -> 169.76s]  whore calls herself an escort. It's the same damn thing. Oh man. Oh, Optimus Prime's in
[169.76s -> 176.76s]  here again. Oh, is he on our team? Hopefully Optimus Prime is on our team. He is. Oh, you've
[178.48s -> 186.66s]  got to hit this. Oh, I will. Oh my God, where'd you go? Where'd that medic go? Oh man, come
[186.66s -> 194.65s]  on now. Oh damn it. No, they aren't. Not if I have anything to say about it. Do you think
[194.65s -> 202.52s]  about that one, Burt? No, I didn't. Oh, heavy on point. What's your butthole catch? Oh, you
[207.00s -> 212.76s]  guys are going to get it. I've almost got it. Oh my God, uber germa. I've almost got it.
[212.76s -> 221.52s]  Uber germa. No, get away. Too many people. I have nowhere to go. Run. Oh, you guys are
[224.68s -> 230.65s]  so going to get this. Over time. We can't even get up there. Don't fucking hate. I just
[230.65s -> 236.30s]  want crates. Oh, we won. Oh, I think we did win. They did. Unless somebody can get on
[236.30s -> 243.80s]  this. I think that's all she wrote. I'm hiding. I've got my Sandman out. Oh, that's it. Good
[248.73s -> 257.24s]  to game. All of them. Here we go. I'm a plain sniper. This is going to be the round where
[257.24s -> 263.24s]  we destroy. At least I hope so. Oh, that guy dropped down right at the right time. What?
[263.64s -> 269.16s]  Oh, you want to duel me, Optimus? You're going to whoop my butt. I got ubered and I just
[269.16s -> 273.76s]  walked outside and started swinging my sword in every which direction and didn't kill anyone.
[273.76s -> 280.76s]  Then I just ran back inside. Oh, God. I'm the worst. Oh my God. I keep on throwing the
[281.12s -> 290.19s]  Girardi right at somebody's back. That's what I wanted to do. Here we go. Wow, I just got
[290.19s -> 296.06s]  fucking... This guy said, po, no offense. You should have a ping limit. Offense taken.
[296.06s -> 301.02s]  I am so rich right now. Oh, that was a nice headshot. That's what I'm talking about. That's
[301.02s -> 310.26s]  what I'm talking about. Let me say, let's keep it rolling, boys. You denying the duels,
[310.26s -> 317.41s]  too? No, God. Oh, I got the Gunslinger. I already have that, don't I? It's a good weapon. Any
[317.41s -> 322.29s]  spies? I'm just throwing the P down. I'm not going to take that chance. Optimus Prime's
[322.29s -> 328.86s]  hiding somewhere. I can't even see. I literally can't even see. I'm just shooting into people's
[329.02s -> 333.58s]  backs. I don't even know if I'm hitting anyone. Okay, now I can leave now this way. So we're
[333.58s -> 338.38s]  doing Battlefield after this, yeah? Yeah, sure. Why not? Well, I'm going to try to.
[338.38s -> 343.74s]  Oh, boom. It's not going to work because my computer's going to be like... Oh, can I get
[343.74s -> 352.06s]  that heavy from back here? There it is. Come on, now. I'm going to try that spy stuff.
[352.06s -> 360.95s]  Damn it. Oh, damn it. Oh, damn it. Oh, Optimus Prime. What is the Envis watch for the spy?
[363.79s -> 370.55s]  I'm stupid. Oh, no. There he goes. There he goes. Off to the races. He's still alive. Off
[370.55s -> 378.48s]  to the races. Get him. He's not dead. He is not dead. He's going to get me right in the
[378.48s -> 394.03s]  back. God damn it. No, I knew it. I knew he was there. I didn't turn around. Oh, don't
[394.03s -> 406.55s]  even go there. There you go. Nice job, guys. That is going to wrap up the video, guys.
[406.55s -> 410.11s]  Thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it, and I will see you guys all
[410.11s -> 413.47s]  next time. Take care, everybody.
