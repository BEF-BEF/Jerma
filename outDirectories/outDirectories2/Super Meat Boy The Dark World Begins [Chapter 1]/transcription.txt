[0.31s -> 14.39s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Super Meat Boy!
[14.39s -> 23.32s]  This is going to be Rage in a Basket that I open up and birds fly out of the basket and peck my eyes out.
[23.32s -> 26.32s]  I am going to be doing the Dark World.
[26.32s -> 31.32s]  And of course, I'm going to start with Chapter 1. We're going to go back to the beginning, back to the roots of the game.
[31.32s -> 37.86s]  I don't know, let's get this started, I don't know how long this is going to last.
[37.86s -> 44.66s]  I probably, to be realistic with you guys, I'm probably going to rage quit the Dark World.
[44.66s -> 47.66s]  Like, two to three chapters into this.
[47.66s -> 50.66s]  Because some of these levels are just ridiculous.
[50.66s -> 52.66s]  But I am going to do the Dark World, going to try and do it.
[52.66s -> 57.97s]  So what do you say to all of you? Welcome to the Dark World.
[57.97s -> 60.97s]  That hurt my voice, but you know what? It's okay.
[60.97s -> 65.40s]  Here we go! Dark World Chapter 1, as Meat Boy.
[65.40s -> 68.40s]  Oh, this already sucks.
[68.40s -> 71.77s]  So if you don't know what the Dark World is...
[71.77s -> 74.14s]  Actually, I should go from this way.
[74.14s -> 76.31s]  The Dark World...
[76.31s -> 77.31s]  That was easy.
[77.31s -> 82.31s]  The Dark World is just much, much harder versions of the levels you've already played.
[82.31s -> 85.81s]  So let's get...oh my god, this is so bad.
[85.81s -> 89.29s]  Good!
[89.29s -> 93.42s]  This one, if I remember...oh, there's a Band-Aid here.
[93.42s -> 95.42s]  Should I even dare try to get the Band-Aid?
[95.42s -> 99.99s]  Oh, I don't know if that's happening.
[99.99s -> 101.99s]  No, not happening. I'll try for it later.
[101.99s -> 105.99s]  I may in fact do a series where I get a lot of the Band-Aids.
[105.99s -> 108.99s]  Kind of like a Band-Aid-tage, I guess you could say.
[108.99s -> 113.99s]  That might be coming in the future, but for now, I just want to try and get through some of the Dark World.
[113.99s -> 115.99s]  Some of it!
[115.99s -> 118.23s]  So let's go, go, go, go, go!
[118.23s -> 121.23s]  That's the name of the game you go!
[121.23s -> 124.79s]  Oh, that's not the way you're supposed to go.
[124.79s -> 133.37s]  The Dark World. Everything is dark and dim and dying.
[133.37s -> 136.50s]  That wasn't actually that bad.
[136.50s -> 140.83s]  I am the Knight, says Batman.
[140.83s -> 144.35s]  Batman Begins, Batman Beyond.
[144.35s -> 148.66s]  I still have not seen The Dark Knight Rises.
[148.66s -> 152.34s]  I don't know why. Why have I not seen that movie?
[152.34s -> 154.34s]  Can somebody answer me that question?
[154.34s -> 157.58s]  Jerma, yeah. Why have you not seen The Dark Knight Rises?
[157.58s -> 159.95s]  I don't know, I haven't seen it yet.
[159.95s -> 162.13s]  I guess that's a good enough answer.
[162.13s -> 165.44s]  Ooh, A+.
[165.44s -> 170.44s]  So what happens if you, I know to open up the Dark World levels, you have to get A-pluses on the Light World levels.
[170.44s -> 174.44s]  But what happens when you get A-pluses on the Dark World levels? Does that do anything spectacular?
[174.44s -> 178.26s]  I think it just adds to the overall completion of the game.
[178.26s -> 181.26s]  And this, yeah, oh, I didn't even see that saw blade!
[181.26s -> 182.75s]  Ugh!
[182.75s -> 187.23s]  Keep that in mind when you get up here again.
[187.23s -> 189.23s]  That's not what you want to be doing!
[189.23s -> 191.88s]  Uh-oh!
[191.88s -> 194.88s]  Starting to get a little bit mad here.
[194.88s -> 197.88s]  You, alright, just slow down.
[197.88s -> 200.70s]  Slow down, you freak.
[200.70s -> 204.15s]  Ooh, oh!
[204.15s -> 209.32s]  I got this. I got this.
[209.32s -> 211.32s]  Slow down! Jump!
[211.32s -> 213.50s]  Oh my god!
[213.50s -> 216.62s]  I swear!
[216.62s -> 218.62s]  And I swear!
[218.62s -> 222.92s]  By the moon and the stars and the sky!
[222.92s -> 223.92s]  What song is that?
[223.92s -> 229.68s]  Whoever can guess that song gets a cookie!
[229.68s -> 232.68s]  Even though I don't have any cookies to give, I can just pretend to give you one.
[234.05s -> 237.05s]  Oh no, I'm really ruining this for myself right here.
[237.05s -> 238.05s]  I gotta...
[238.05s -> 239.67s]  Oh no!
[239.67s -> 243.06s]  Oh, it's over!
[243.06s -> 244.06s]  Just get out of my way.
[244.06s -> 245.56s]  Get...
[245.56s -> 248.56s]  Stop falling over back and forth.
[248.56s -> 251.21s]  Getting up there is no problem.
[251.21s -> 252.21s]  It's when you're actually here.
[252.21s -> 253.83s]  This is...
[253.83s -> 255.83s]  You want to get up top like this and...
[255.83s -> 257.83s]  Oh god!
[257.83s -> 262.94s]  That's a cat.
[262.94s -> 264.62s]  Hissing.
[264.62s -> 271.18s]  You know you're starting to lose your mind with this game when you actually start to hiss or make animal noises.
[271.18s -> 272.62s]  So if I...
[272.62s -> 273.62s]  Oh, look what I just did!
[273.62s -> 274.62s]  Yay!
[274.62s -> 275.62s]  Look at that!
[275.62s -> 276.62s]  I can jump over there now!
[276.62s -> 277.62s]  Urgh!
[277.62s -> 281.74s]  Let's go...
[281.74s -> 282.74s]  Watch it!
[282.74s -> 283.74s]  That was close.
[283.74s -> 286.42s]  That was very close.
[286.42s -> 287.42s]  Indeed.
[287.42s -> 288.42s]  I gotta not do that.
[288.42s -> 290.42s]  Get the top layer and then...
[290.42s -> 294.84s]  Shhh...
[294.84s -> 295.84s]  Just like that.
[295.84s -> 296.84s]  Just like that.
[296.84s -> 297.84s]  No!
[297.84s -> 300.23s]  Just jump over it.
[300.23s -> 302.23s]  Who cares about the stupid thing in the middle?
[302.23s -> 305.20s]  Fuck face.
[305.20s -> 311.07s]  I am going to elbow drop this game.
[312.57s -> 316.57s]  I'm going to go to wherever this game is stored on my Steam Cloud.
[316.57s -> 319.57s]  And I'm going to Randy Savage elbow drop it.
[319.57s -> 325.35s]  Off the top friggin' turnbuckle.
[325.35s -> 326.35s]  This is so hard.
[326.35s -> 327.35s]  I just gotta...
[327.35s -> 328.35s]  You know what?
[328.35s -> 329.35s]  Just jump over.
[329.35s -> 330.35s]  Jump.
[330.35s -> 331.35s]  Jump over.
[331.35s -> 332.35s]  Jump.
[332.35s -> 333.85s]  Jump.
[333.85s -> 334.85s]  No!
[334.85s -> 335.85s]  I had it!
[335.85s -> 337.41s]  I just had it!
[337.41s -> 338.41s]  Alright.
[338.41s -> 341.50s]  Seriously.
[341.50s -> 342.50s]  Seriously, no.
[342.50s -> 343.50s]  Let's go.
[343.50s -> 344.50s]  Come on.
[344.50s -> 345.50s]  This is getting a little ridiculous.
[345.50s -> 346.50s]  Jump.
[346.50s -> 347.50s]  I can't believe that...
[347.50s -> 348.50s]  I sound like Stewie Griffin.
[348.50s -> 350.06s]  You know, I say...
[350.06s -> 353.06s]  I can't believe that Super Meat Boy is this difficult of a game.
[353.06s -> 355.06s]  You know, I don't like it at all.
[355.06s -> 357.37s]  I would much rather kill Mother.
[357.37s -> 358.37s]  Oh my god.
[358.37s -> 360.37s]  Just beat the level.
[360.37s -> 366.09s]  When am I going to rage quit the Dark World?
[366.09s -> 367.09s]  Probably right now.
[367.09s -> 370.42s]  I can't do this.
[376.42s -> 377.42s]  All it takes...
[377.42s -> 378.42s]  See, the hardest...
[378.42s -> 379.42s]  You know what?
[379.42s -> 380.42s]  Screw this!
[380.42s -> 385.47s]  Should have done this so friggin' long ago.
[385.47s -> 388.10s]  This is so simple with Commander Video.
[388.10s -> 390.10s]  What the hell am I doing?
[390.10s -> 395.43s]  Oh, look.
[395.43s -> 396.43s]  Commander Video.
[396.43s -> 400.43s]  Oh, you like beat it with Commander Video because it's easy with Commander Video?
[400.43s -> 401.74s]  God.
[401.74s -> 406.49s]  What a stick in my eye and turn it around five different ways.
[407.86s -> 412.87s]  Commander Video.
[412.87s -> 413.87s]  Come on.
[413.87s -> 414.87s]  You're the best character in the game.
[414.87s -> 416.30s]  Let's go.
[416.30s -> 417.30s]  Oh, look at that.
[417.30s -> 418.30s]  Beautiful.
[418.30s -> 419.30s]  That wasn't beautiful.
[419.30s -> 422.82s]  That was not beautiful.
[422.82s -> 423.82s]  Started out okay.
[423.82s -> 426.82s]  And then got real ugly really quick.
[426.82s -> 429.22s]  Wow.
[429.22s -> 431.80s]  No.
[431.80s -> 432.80s]  I held it down.
[432.80s -> 433.80s]  Wow.
[433.80s -> 434.80s]  How the hell did I survive that?
[434.80s -> 438.28s]  I'm coming, Princess.
[438.28s -> 441.76s]  I don't even know.
[441.76s -> 442.76s]  What was the name of this level?
[442.76s -> 443.76s]  Fire something?
[443.76s -> 446.38s]  Fire something or other?
[446.38s -> 450.65s]  Oh, I just fall down and ditch and die.
[450.65s -> 454.85s]  Can I jump up the top there?
[454.85s -> 456.34s]  I think I can.
[456.34s -> 458.61s]  Can I make that?
[458.61s -> 460.91s]  No, definitely not.
[460.91s -> 463.22s]  Maybe if I had the patience to try this.
[463.22s -> 464.84s]  No, no, no.
[464.84s -> 465.84s]  We're not going to do that.
[465.84s -> 469.49s]  We're going to do this the way it's supposed to be done.
[469.49s -> 470.66s]  Just like this.
[470.66s -> 472.16s]  Just like that.
[472.16s -> 474.34s]  And stumble a bunch.
[474.34s -> 476.34s]  And now you're screwed.
[476.34s -> 477.96s]  Yay.
[477.96s -> 482.27s]  Doc.
[482.27s -> 483.27s]  World.
[483.27s -> 489.25s]  Take the whole damn wall down.
[489.25s -> 491.94s]  I can't be going that high.
[491.94s -> 492.94s]  Okay.
[492.94s -> 493.94s]  Jump up here.
[493.94s -> 494.94s]  Jump around.
[494.94s -> 496.88s]  There it is.
[496.88s -> 499.02s]  Finally.
[499.02s -> 500.02s]  And I got an A plus to boot.
[500.02s -> 501.38s]  Oh, I should have.
[501.38s -> 503.38s]  I should be showing some of these lives.
[503.38s -> 506.99s]  Oh, man.
[506.99s -> 507.99s]  Oh, man.
[507.99s -> 508.99s]  Oh, man.
[508.99s -> 509.99s]  That was tough.
[509.99s -> 510.99s]  What?
[510.99s -> 515.58s]  Was there a Band-Aid up there in the top left?
[515.58s -> 517.26s]  Band-Aid right there.
[517.26s -> 522.74s]  This is going to be tough.
[522.74s -> 523.74s]  Come on.
[523.74s -> 526.01s]  Come down.
[526.01s -> 527.57s]  Why?
[527.57s -> 528.57s]  Why?
[528.57s -> 533.58s]  Up, up, and away.
[533.58s -> 534.58s]  Again.
[534.58s -> 536.59s]  Again.
[536.59s -> 537.59s]  Wow.
[537.59s -> 543.93s]  Just don't be stupid here and you got it.
[543.93s -> 546.00s]  You, you're stupid.
[546.00s -> 550.20s]  You did it anyways.
[550.20s -> 551.95s]  Kick machine.
[551.95s -> 554.98s]  I'll give you a kick.
[554.98s -> 558.29s]  I'll kick you right in the balls.
[558.29s -> 565.78s]  Floating is so good.
[565.78s -> 567.14s]  It's so useful.
[567.14s -> 568.14s]  Man.
[568.14s -> 569.14s]  Oh, man.
[569.14s -> 570.14s]  This is going to hold.
[570.14s -> 571.14s]  I got to look at this.
[571.14s -> 572.14s]  I got to look at the pattern here.
[572.14s -> 575.47s]  So you got to go up in the very beginning.
[575.47s -> 577.97s]  So I got to go up right here.
[577.97s -> 581.46s]  No, right here and wait, jump, wait, jump.
[581.46s -> 582.46s]  And that's it.
[582.46s -> 584.46s]  And I have to go through.
[584.46s -> 585.46s]  Oh, no.
[585.46s -> 588.60s]  Oh, no, dude.
[588.60s -> 589.60s]  Really?
[589.60s -> 594.25s]  I'm going to jump over it at perfect times.
[594.25s -> 595.25s]  Get it.
[595.25s -> 598.47s]  Night game.
[598.47s -> 600.93s]  Sure.
[600.93s -> 602.55s]  I'll play some night golf.
[604.56s -> 607.56s]  You guys have ever played night golf with the illuminated balls?
[607.56s -> 608.56s]  It's actually pretty fun.
[608.56s -> 613.17s]  Go, go, go, go.
[613.17s -> 614.34s]  All right.
[614.34s -> 615.34s]  Now I got to go now.
[615.34s -> 616.34s]  Damn it.
[616.34s -> 617.34s]  I went at the wrong time.
[617.34s -> 626.06s]  Oh, for the love of just.
[626.06s -> 627.06s]  Wait, go.
[627.06s -> 628.23s]  Wait, go.
[628.23s -> 630.24s]  I'm done.
[630.24s -> 631.24s]  This is over.
[631.24s -> 633.76s]  I got this.
[633.76s -> 635.32s]  Get up there.
[635.32s -> 638.78s]  Hello, my sweet queen.
[638.78s -> 639.78s]  Getting close.
[639.78s -> 643.72s]  I only have a few more levels of the first dark world.
[643.72s -> 646.96s]  I might change back to meat boy for this one.
[646.96s -> 647.96s]  Maybe not.
[647.96s -> 650.26s]  The floating really helps like that.
[650.26s -> 653.26s]  But it didn't matter anyways, because I'm stupid.
[653.26s -> 657.13s]  Damn.
[657.13s -> 662.98s]  Oh, I don't know what to do with myself.
[662.98s -> 665.43s]  There we are.
[665.43s -> 666.43s]  Oh, God.
[666.43s -> 667.43s]  OK.
[667.43s -> 672.53s]  After this one goes around, go now.
[672.53s -> 674.73s]  Hey.
[674.73s -> 677.31s]  What do you know?
[677.31s -> 678.31s]  Level 18.
[678.31s -> 680.31s]  The level that hurts your eyes.
[680.31s -> 684.30s]  Just know.
[684.30s -> 685.30s]  Wow.
[685.30s -> 687.12s]  That gets close.
[687.12s -> 688.12s]  I got to go before it comes up.
[688.12s -> 689.12s]  No.
[689.12s -> 692.13s]  That thing is really close.
[692.13s -> 694.13s]  You got to get it done.
[694.13s -> 695.62s]  Meat boy.
[695.62s -> 697.62s]  You have to go really, really fast here.
[697.62s -> 700.18s]  Right when this moves over, you got to go right now.
[700.18s -> 701.18s]  Quick.
[701.18s -> 702.18s]  Quick.
[702.18s -> 705.66s]  There it is.
[705.66s -> 706.66s]  The Queener.
[706.66s -> 707.66s]  Here is the end.
[707.66s -> 708.66s]  This is it.
[708.66s -> 709.66s]  Give me that bandaid.
[709.66s -> 711.35s]  Can I get it?
[711.35s -> 712.35s]  Oh, I can get that.
[712.35s -> 713.35s]  That's a bandaid I can get.
[713.35s -> 715.23s]  No problem.
[715.23s -> 717.11s]  Give me that bandaid.
[717.11s -> 718.11s]  Oh, no.
[718.11s -> 719.11s]  I want that bandaid.
[719.11s -> 720.61s]  I can get this.
[720.61s -> 721.61s]  Come on.
[721.61s -> 723.17s]  Stop being such a fool, man.
[723.17s -> 725.30s]  There it is.
[725.30s -> 728.78s]  OK, cool.
[728.78s -> 729.78s]  Don't.
[730.78s -> 737.27s]  And bandaid get.
[737.27s -> 739.41s]  Hooray.
[739.41s -> 741.78s]  And this is it.
[741.78s -> 746.30s]  Hopefully this doesn't take me 5,000 years.
[746.30s -> 750.10s]  Whoa.
[750.10s -> 753.00s]  Yeah.
[753.00s -> 754.00s]  OK.
[754.00s -> 757.75s]  Got to be even more cautious here.
[757.75s -> 759.38s]  No.
[759.38s -> 760.38s]  Oh.
[760.38s -> 761.38s]  Oh, my God.
[761.38s -> 764.38s]  I'm running on pure just anger and hatred right now.
[764.38s -> 765.38s]  Wow.
[765.38s -> 766.55s]  That was close.
[766.55s -> 767.55s]  Come on.
[767.55s -> 769.24s]  Yes.
[769.24s -> 770.24s]  I did it.
[770.24s -> 775.31s]  This is going to be the Dark World completed for Chapter 1.
[775.31s -> 776.31s]  Excellent.
[776.31s -> 777.31s]  Phew.
[777.31s -> 779.64s]  Oh, my God.
[779.64s -> 783.02s]  That was pretty nuts.
[783.02s -> 785.02s]  So yeah, that's going to wrap it up here, guys.
[785.02s -> 786.02s]  Thank you so much for watching.
[786.02s -> 787.02s]  I really do appreciate it.
[787.02s -> 791.02s]  And we're going to take on Chapter 2, Dark World, in the next episode.
[791.02s -> 795.02s]  And you might see before that, I don't know how I'm going to do these next few videos,
[795.02s -> 800.02s]  but you might see a bandaid run where it's a montage or a few clips of me getting all
[800.02s -> 804.02s]  the band-aids in a particular world or something or other.
[804.02s -> 805.02s]  So, thanks, guys, for watching.
[805.02s -> 806.02s]  I really do appreciate it.
[806.02s -> 808.02s]  And I'll see you guys all next time.
[808.02s -> 810.02s]  And, of course, take care, everybody.
