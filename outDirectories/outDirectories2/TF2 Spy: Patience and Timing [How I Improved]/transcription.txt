[0.31s -> 15.87s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight.
[15.87s -> 25.87s]  I'm gonna be playing as the Spy with the Conivers Kunai, the strange Conivers Kunai, the Ambassador, and the Dead Ringer.
[25.87s -> 31.11s]  I believe all of these things are strange. And this video is not going to talk about the gameplay really that much.
[31.11s -> 36.11s]  I actually do want to bring up a couple of things about stabs, certain stabs that I do.
[36.11s -> 41.11s]  But for the most part, I want to talk about a very important thing, two very important things about the Spy,
[41.11s -> 49.11s]  and how to improve your Spy game, and how to continue down the path of future game improvement, at least with Team Fortress 2.
[49.11s -> 57.61s]  You can call this a tips and tricks video, but it's not really gonna talk about any specific tips or specific tricks to do in the game.
[57.61s -> 62.98s]  What it is going to talk about though is patience and timing.
[62.98s -> 68.98s]  And I'll give you a little bit of backstory here. Back in 2007, when I first got this game, I was really good at Spy.
[68.98s -> 74.47s]  Spy was my number one, it was my main, I guess you could say, and now it's turned into Engineer.
[74.47s -> 82.47s]  And it's kind of funny how that happened. I mean, I went from being and playing the class that was the Anti-Engineer,
[82.47s -> 88.47s]  to then going, you know what, I kind of want to play the Engineer. So I don't know how that happened exactly.
[88.47s -> 95.78s]  But what I do know is one very important thing. I lost my Spy game. I've said this before in other videos, you guys have heard it before.
[95.78s -> 103.14s]  I just lost my Spy game. I lost being able to get the right stabs, and finding the situations to jump out and actually get somebody.
[103.14s -> 111.14s]  And I think I finally figured it out. I think I finally turned it onto my brain and said, you know, I know why I'm not good with Spy anymore.
[111.14s -> 118.45s]  And I know why I've dwindled down in my Spy gameplay. And it has to do with patience. I don't have any.
[118.45s -> 123.82s]  And I used to. And it actually took me until this gameplay right here to realize that.
[123.82s -> 126.82s]  If you see what I'm doing right now, this is a good example of what I'm talking about.
[126.82s -> 134.82s]  Old Jerma would have jumped out of that immediately, that dead ringer. But no, I waited patiently, I stood my ground, and I picked up the double stab.
[134.82s -> 143.18s]  That's the type of stuff I'm talking about. Using your willpower and your patience and your timing to be able to get kills as the Spy,
[143.18s -> 148.18s]  because that is how you are supposed to play Spy. That's how the class is designed to be played.
[148.18s -> 153.18s]  And I think that more recently, I've just been trying to run at people and stab them in their face.
[153.18s -> 156.18s]  And that's not going to work. You have to stab them in the back, obviously.
[156.18s -> 161.18s]  And I feel like running at people and trying to get right behind them, just, I've got to get behind this guy and stab him.
[161.18s -> 166.36s]  That's not how you're supposed to play. You're supposed to use cunning. You're supposed to use deception.
[166.36s -> 171.36s]  And pretty much everything that I've gone over so far is how you're supposed to play the class.
[171.36s -> 175.36s]  And I think I know exactly the point where this all happened.
[175.36s -> 181.36s]  And I think for a lot of us, for a lot of us old Spy players, I think we can pinpoint one place where this all started to happen.
[181.36s -> 184.54s]  I mean, maybe it's just me, but if it's not, let me know.
[184.54s -> 189.71s]  But at least for me, it was when I started exclusively using the dead ringer.
[189.71s -> 195.71s]  Back in 2009, when that came out, I thought it was the coolest item ever, and I used it so much.
[195.71s -> 199.71s]  And I think what happened is, because the dead ringer, it takes away the patience.
[199.71s -> 206.71s]  It takes away the sense of urgency because you can essentially live forever if you play your cards right with the dead ringer.
[206.71s -> 214.21s]  And what I started doing is simply running up to people and knowing I can get them to activate the dead ringer, and I would be fine.
[214.21s -> 218.21s]  And then I'd just go get behind them and try to get a stab and rinse and repeat.
[218.21s -> 223.21s]  The cunning and the deception sort of left my repertoire.
[223.21s -> 228.21s]  I stopped doing it because, you know what, I'm just going to run into this guy and blow you and y'all and get him.
[228.21s -> 231.58s]  And that's where it all started for me.
[231.58s -> 236.75s]  And I think the dead ringer, don't get me wrong, the dead ringer is a great item, and so is the invisibility watch.
[236.75s -> 238.75s]  And the cloak and dagger is fun as well.
[238.75s -> 241.75s]  They all have their things. They all have their ups and downs.
[241.75s -> 251.75s]  But I was taking the abilities from the watch and transitioned that to core class abilities, which is what I shouldn't have done.
[251.75s -> 256.75s]  And this is the whole tips and tricks portion of this video, if you can even call it that.
[256.75s -> 264.75s]  But when you use the dead ringer or any of the watches, make sure you do not lose the core class mechanics.
[264.75s -> 268.75s]  Don't rely on a certain item to do something for you.
[268.75s -> 271.75s]  And this is completely and totally not class specific.
[271.75s -> 273.75s]  You can talk about this with any of the classes.
[273.75s -> 281.75s]  Never transition an item ability into a core class ability or core class philosophy, because that will start to really screw up your game.
[281.75s -> 287.12s]  And I guess my final thought on all of this is sort of directed at the newer players.
[287.12s -> 292.12s]  If you just got the game or if you downloaded the game less than a couple weeks ago or a couple months ago or something like that,
[292.12s -> 296.12s]  then you want to know how to play Spy and you want to know, oh, how do I get a backstab?
[296.12s -> 298.12s]  How do I grab something? How do I kill people?
[298.12s -> 306.12s]  What you really want to do, guys, is you have to, from the ground up, you have to play the way the class is designed to be played.
[306.12s -> 312.12s]  And you have to, from the ground up, know when and where to go and who your target should be.
[312.12s -> 316.12s]  And, you know, do I get that medic first or should I go after the engineer that's over there?
[316.12s -> 324.12s]  That's all about the Spy. It's all about picking your targets, choosing your targets, and knowing the time and place when to do it.
[324.12s -> 329.62s]  Now, that can take a while. I mean, the Spy is not the easiest class to play by any means,
[329.62s -> 334.62s]  because the Spy and the Engineer and the Medic, I guess you could say the Medic is in this category as well,
[334.62s -> 340.79s]  they are the classes that the more you know the game, the better you are going to play with them.
[340.79s -> 344.79s]  For instance, you're going to find out all the great engineer sentry places on every map.
[344.79s -> 348.79s]  You're going to find all the great places to stand as the Spy, where you know people are going to come in,
[348.79s -> 352.79s]  where choke points are, the great places to hide, the great places to sneak through tunnels.
[352.79s -> 358.79s]  And as a Medic, of course, you're going to find out all the class abilities and all the things people are going to be doing and all the heal priorities.
[358.79s -> 363.03s]  So it's all about the patience. It's all about that patience, baby.
[363.03s -> 368.03s]  And I'm sure you guys all know this by now, that, I mean, I've been playing this game for a long time,
[368.03s -> 372.03s]  and I don't really consider myself to be that fantastic of a player.
[372.03s -> 377.03s]  I'm still learning things. You guys still tell me things in this comment section that I didn't even know.
[377.03s -> 381.03s]  I mean, I learn something from you guys pretty much every day, and that's fantastic.
[381.03s -> 388.27s]  I love being able to keep the knowledge process going, because there's a lot of different things in this game.
[388.27s -> 391.27s]  There's a lot of mechanics, there's a lot of math going on in the background.
[391.27s -> 396.27s]  So there can be a lot of confusion, especially because there's nine classes, all the different items, all the different abilities.
[396.27s -> 401.77s]  It's crazy sometimes, and I think that's why we love this game so much.
[401.77s -> 405.39s]  But that is going to wrap up the video, guys. Thank you all so much for watching.
[405.39s -> 408.39s]  I really do appreciate it, and I'll see you guys all next time.
[408.39s -> 411.39s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
