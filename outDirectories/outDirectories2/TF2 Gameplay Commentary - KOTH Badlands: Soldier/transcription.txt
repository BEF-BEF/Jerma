[0.31s -> 4.11s]  Hey, what is going on guys? It's Jerma with a gameplay commentary.
[4.11s -> 9.43s]  This time I'm on King of the Hill Badlands as a Soldier, and I'm using the default rocket
[9.43s -> 15.01s]  launcher, the buff banner, and the riding crop, making this heavy run frigging a thousand
[15.01s -> 18.29s]  miles per hour, getting them right up to the front lines.
[18.29s -> 24.97s]  Kill a Soldier and I get murked in two seconds by these hippies that were here.
[24.97s -> 29.27s]  The only thing I changed from the Uber update is the riding crop, the disciplinary action
[29.27s -> 36.94s]  is the only item I took from the Uber update, because I can't use the other, hold on, this
[36.94s -> 41.74s]  is really funny. This spy is AFK the entire match, and I use
[41.74s -> 44.78s]  him the entire match to run really fast out of the spawn.
[44.78s -> 47.98s]  I'm not sure if it was a good idea or not, because I could probably have just ran out,
[47.98s -> 52.04s]  and I don't know if I was wasting my time or not, but I figured that if he was watching
[52.04s -> 55.14s]  at some point and just see it happen, I thought it would be funny.
[55.14s -> 58.70s]  Kill this heavy medic pair with an instant crit rocket, I am a jerk for doing that, I'm
[59.38s -> 65.38s]  sorry, whoever that heavy was. But back to what I was saying before, this is my default
[65.38s -> 70.02s]  setup usually, if I did not have the riding crop, I would have the equalizer, and I'm
[70.02s -> 74.10s]  so glad I could change. Speaking of the buff banner, here it is right
[74.10s -> 80.81s]  here, and oh, I killed two engineers with one rocket, but the sentry kills me.
[80.81s -> 86.16s]  If I had known that sentry was there, I would not have taken that route, obviously, but
[86.16s -> 90.14s]  I love the buff banner. It gimps you a little bit when you don't have
[90.66s -> 98.27s]  the shotgun, but it's something about giving every single person around you many crits,
[99.63s -> 103.99s]  and even for you, it's gotten me out of a lot of trouble when I'm stuck in a corner
[103.99s -> 107.71s]  somewhere and I have it, and I use it, and I kill four or five people.
[107.71s -> 114.58s]  So I like to use it, I couldn't use the new rocket launcher, I tried, I know I said in
[114.58s -> 120.41s]  a previous video in the uber update item demonstration video that I was going to try really hard
[120.41s -> 127.61s]  to use it, I did, I tried using it in about six or seven different servers, and I just
[127.61s -> 134.29s]  couldn't, it was good, I liked it, but that third rocket, sorry, that fourth rocket not
[134.29s -> 140.02s]  being there, they were like at least four or five times, I counted, where I would have
[140.02s -> 145.73s]  killed somebody with the fourth rocket and it just didn't happen, and I just can't use
[145.73s -> 147.77s]  it. Hey, what's going on, Spy, how are you? I'm
[147.85s -> 153.56s]  good, thanks. So I don't really play Soldier that often, Soldier's not really like one
[153.56s -> 159.67s]  of my classes, quote unquote, but I figured I don't have a Soldier gameplay, and some
[159.67s -> 165.03s]  of you guys probably will ask for it, so here is one of the probably few Soldier gameplays
[165.03s -> 170.15s]  I do, and I do okay, I do pretty well, I think I'm the number one scorer at the end of the
[170.15s -> 176.46s]  round, but King of the Hill maps are a lot of fun, they can get a little chaotic though,
[176.50s -> 181.58s]  as in most King of the Hill maps, the spawn points are really, really, really close to
[181.58s -> 187.66s]  the point, and you can get into a lot of trouble with spawn camping and stuff like that, like
[187.66s -> 192.38s]  as in right here, I kind of back off, I would have died definitely anyways, but you never
[192.38s -> 197.38s]  know what people are going to consider spawn camping, so you just let people come out,
[197.38s -> 205.61s]  don't spawn camp, don't be a jerk. So I have the buff banner now, and I blow the horny
[205.61s -> 212.32s]  horn, try and get a few of my guys to get crits, I kill this Heavy with another random
[212.32s -> 217.02s]  crit, I think that's the second time that's happened, again I'm really sorry, but it probably
[217.02s -> 221.72s]  wouldn't have mattered, I hear an engineer building, I couldn't find it, I find it here,
[221.72s -> 226.34s]  I eventually get killed, I think, no, I come around this corner here and I do a super swing
[226.34s -> 231.07s]  shoot, and I kill that sniper, I thought that was pretty cool, because I'm not really, I'm
[231.07s -> 235.43s]  not that great with Soldier, I, that's to me to do something like that, I was like,
[235.83s -> 241.07s]  nice, that was a pretty sick thing I did, kill that spy, come up around the corner,
[241.07s -> 247.52s]  we got a minute left, trying to get this Heavy, don't get him, he gets me with his default
[247.52s -> 252.77s]  minigun, which you don't see very many of those as of today, after the Uber update,
[252.77s -> 259.38s]  so anyone that's not using the Tomislav, good for you, because it's good to have it spread
[259.38s -> 263.82s]  out a little bit, not have every single person use the new things, and that's another reason
[263.82s -> 269.40s]  why I could be using the Liberty Launcher right now, but everybody and their grandmother
[269.40s -> 274.54s]  is using it right now, same thing with the Tomislav, pretty much all the new items, it's,
[274.54s -> 277.98s]  I mean, I understand people are trying to get used to him, me and the Soldier sprinting
[277.98s -> 285.06s]  up here, we both take out this Heavy together, see how unbelievably useful the riding crop
[285.06s -> 291.42s]  is, so stop using the Equalizer, use the riding crop, so they get on the point here, and I
[291.42s -> 295.54s]  only have three health, so I'm trying to just sneak over here and pick somebody off, I get
[295.54s -> 300.58s]  one person, but it doesn't matter, and this screenshot is great, according to the kill
[300.58s -> 306.69s]  feed, it didn't turn out so well, so they get the point, and we're stuck in overtime
[306.69s -> 313.86s]  now, and this is kind of how King of the Hill maps go sometimes, you know, you'll be down
[313.86s -> 320.02s]  to the wire, you'll win, essentially your team wins, and the other team at overtime
[320.02s -> 326.22s]  gets it back, and a lot of times, from here on out, they will win this match, that's why
[326.22s -> 331.18s]  King of the Hill is interesting, because you never know what's really going to happen,
[331.18s -> 338.74s]  so this is kind of embarrassing, I kill this Soldier, and then I get destroyed by a Medic's
[338.74s -> 344.61s]  Bonesaw Crit, and I was saying when that happened, I was like, oh, maybe I can like cut that
[344.61s -> 350.97s]  out and nobody will notice, but, I mean, I left it, but I'm not going to take it out,
[350.97s -> 355.33s]  I promise, this is the last time I'm going to use you for my own gain, so get out here
[355.33s -> 360.33s]  to the last point, they only have one minute left, and thanks to this guy up here, this
[360.33s -> 365.61s]  Soldier that was up there firing, doing suppressing fire, we got to keep the point, we end up
[365.61s -> 370.35s]  getting everybody on it, and we are the Weenas!
[370.35s -> 375.69s]  So this next clip here, it's kind of like a bonus clip, I guess you could say, it's
[375.69s -> 383.26s]  me as a spy on Nucleus, I don't use the Eternal Reward at all, it's an Eternal Reward gameplay,
[383.30s -> 387.46s]  but I figured because I was showcasing the Soldier, which is something I don't do that
[387.46s -> 392.06s]  often, I would just put this in here, I was a little late, as you can see, it's about
[392.06s -> 396.54s]  two minutes on each side right now, and I managed to get to the top score position,
[396.54s -> 400.38s]  so I think that was pretty cool, I have to come in late, so I get a couple kills here,
[400.38s -> 405.38s]  I get this Soldier, I get this Sniper too, and just to talk about what I don't like about
[405.38s -> 409.94s]  the Eternal Reward, why I never use it, I think it's very counterintuitive as playing
[409.94s -> 415.02s]  a spy, I think you should not have to run behind every single person to get your first
[415.02s -> 418.70s]  kill, I don't know, it's not a philosophy I agree with, this is a cool headshot right
[418.70s -> 423.06s]  here, I'm the Scout, I get the kill, but it's something that I don't agree with, I think
[423.06s -> 428.26s]  that as a spy, you're supposed to, the core gameplay as a spy is you're supposed to blend
[428.26s -> 434.90s]  in and fool people and use people's ignorances to your advantage, I think with this knife
[434.90s -> 438.14s]  you just can't really do that, because right now I'm just running around as a red spy,
[438.14s -> 445.14s]  and it's right there, everybody knows it, and spies are a red flag in this game, spies
[445.14s -> 451.02s]  and medics in this game are red flags, if you see a spy, you kill it, and you do everything
[451.02s -> 456.54s]  you can to kill it, otherwise you didn't do your job, oh spy, I didn't kill that spy,
[456.54s -> 460.86s]  same thing with a medic, if you see a medic, it's just a big red flag, and I know a lot
[460.86s -> 466.38s]  of you guys use this knife on offense when you're playing in a control point map or a
[466.50s -> 471.66s]  payload map, I just don't understand how you guys can do that, it's just too hard, see
[471.66s -> 476.94s]  king of the hill maps, it's easy to get behind people because everyone's all over the place,
[476.94s -> 480.90s]  by the way here's a quick tip if you guys don't know, if you sap a building and no one's
[480.90s -> 486.50s]  around, take your revolver out and shoot it a couple times, it will die ten times faster
[486.50s -> 490.46s]  than if you just sapped it and ran away, and you shouldn't sap it and run away if no one's
[490.46s -> 494.50s]  around because you'll look in the top right corner of the screen in the notification area
[494.58s -> 499.58s]  and find out, oh the engineer just came back and got rid of the sapper, so give it a few
[499.58s -> 504.62s]  shots and I guarantee you that the engineer will not even have time to react, even if
[504.62s -> 509.66s]  the engineer happens to be ten feet away, you can take out a full sentry before he even
[509.66s -> 514.26s]  realizes what's going on, even if he gets there, don't freak out, still do it because
[514.26s -> 519.26s]  you can really take down a sentry like that, see right here I didn't have a disguise and
[519.26s -> 524.82s]  I ran out of cloak, so I'm a red flag like I was saying before, but it doesn't matter,
[524.82s -> 530.02s]  our team handles it pretty well, we end up winning the round and as you can see I made
[530.02s -> 534.38s]  it to the bottom of the chart there when I came in, about half way through the match,
[534.38s -> 540.82s]  so that's pretty cool, I want to announce this right now too, if I get 500 subscribers,
[540.82s -> 547.66s]  I will do a video showcasing me in real life, you'll get to see me in real life, finally
[547.66s -> 553.82s]  the man behind the mask, and I'm going to do a workout exercise video to try and pump
[553.82s -> 558.02s]  some of you guys up, so you'll be able to watch that video and go listen to what I tell
[558.02s -> 564.34s]  you and you'll get fucking huge donations, but anyways for real though, thanks a lot
[564.34s -> 568.82s]  guys you guys, all this means a lot to me, it's awesome, so shoot for 500!
