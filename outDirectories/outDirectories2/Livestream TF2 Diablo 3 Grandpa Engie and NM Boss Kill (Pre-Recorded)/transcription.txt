[1.21s -> 26.77s]  720p for the win. Starting in 15 minutes. Exactly. Let's do it. Alright, ladies and germs.
[26.77s -> 37.71s]  And let us go into a new server. Let's try and see how many people are in my server right now.
[37.71s -> 52.22s]  My server is currently full, but it's okay. We can fill up an empty one.
[52.22s -> 56.98s]  Just because that's what I typically do anyways. So let's fill up an empty server.
[56.98s -> 63.54s]  Just because I feel like a lot of you guys would rather be able to see where we're playing and you guys in the stream would like to play.
[63.54s -> 72.96s]  So here is the IP. If you can see it on the screen, I'm also going to put it in here.
[72.96s -> 83.15s]  It's going to be... Oh god, I have a lot of tight balls in that statement.
[83.15s -> 90.36s]  And there you go. Posting it right now.
[90.36s -> 99.56s]  Funda Mountain.
[99.56s -> 103.56s]  Germany needs a catchphrase like Chibi's chocolate sauce.
[103.56s -> 108.40s]  How long am I going to be streaming Diablo 3?
[108.40s -> 111.40s]  At least a couple hours. At least.
[111.40s -> 114.54s]  At least that.
[114.54s -> 119.54s]  Oh, and is the stream running okay? There's a 360 and a 720 option.
[119.54s -> 124.54s]  Are both of them looking okay? Or is it... How does it look? Are we good?
[124.54s -> 131.58s]  Hopefully we're good.
[131.58s -> 135.58s]  Because this is the first time I've ever streamed in 720 and I think the test went...
[135.58s -> 140.58s]  The test went okay. I don't know if it's perfect, but it should be better than before.
[143.22s -> 148.02s]  Let's watch the...
[148.02s -> 155.17s]  And while I think about it, let me turn up my fans here.
[155.17s -> 162.76s]  How is that even possible?
[162.76s -> 170.14s]  Diablo 3 looks... Oh no, Diablo 3 is fun, man.
[170.14s -> 177.14s]  I got a lot of problems I have with it, but they are overshadowed by the fact that the game is really good.
[177.14s -> 182.26s]  So I can't really complain.
[182.26s -> 187.65s]  I have a major, major problem with it though, and it's something I can't get over.
[187.65s -> 191.65s]  I'll probably talk about it in...
[191.65s -> 196.83s]  The video I do when I review the game.
[196.83s -> 204.23s]  When I actually review the game, I will talk about it.
[204.23s -> 207.62s]  Where is everybody?
[207.62s -> 212.42s]  Where is everybody?
[212.42s -> 216.18s]  Somebody want to post the IP again? In the chat?
[216.18s -> 221.18s]  Oh, make sure, if you haven't already done it, select update automatically.
[221.18s -> 226.27s]  For your stream thing on the chat window.
[226.27s -> 229.22s]  Yah, yah.
[229.22s -> 236.81s]  It's going to be 1v1. There's a lot of spots in this server.
[236.81s -> 238.81s]  I'll do this, so you guys can see.
[238.81s -> 241.81s]  Because maybe the chat is lagging or something.
[241.81s -> 244.62s]  This is the server.
[244.62s -> 249.62s]  63.146.183.23.27015.
[249.62s -> 252.99s]  If you take a look at it right now, write it down maybe.
[252.99s -> 257.09s]  That's where we're going to be for a little while.
[257.09s -> 260.09s]  And hopefully you guys got it by now, so I'm going to close it, and here we go.
[260.09s -> 266.98s]  The only problem with Diablo 3 is the constant...
[266.98s -> 270.98s]  That's another thing that's kind of shaky in my opinion as well.
[270.98s -> 273.60s]  What's up, ZCS? How you doing, bro?
[273.60s -> 278.27s]  The combat is incredible though.
[278.27s -> 280.27s]  It is one of the most satisfying combat games.
[280.27s -> 283.27s]  At least action RPG combat games ever played.
[283.27s -> 287.02s]  Playing a barbarian if you didn't see the video.
[287.02s -> 291.42s]  Man, what's going on? Is this...
[291.42s -> 294.42s]  Are we getting like a crash or something? No one's really joining.
[294.42s -> 303.78s]  What is going on with this server?
[303.78s -> 308.26s]  People should be able to join.
[308.26s -> 310.26s]  Yah, I'll go online. That makes more sense.
[310.26s -> 315.06s]  Alright, you can join off me.
[315.06s -> 317.06s]  You can join off me.
[317.06s -> 322.86s]  You can, and in fact will join off me.
[322.86s -> 331.66s]  Yah, I gotta go over to Twitch and say it's not going to be there.
[331.66s -> 336.90s]  The only reason why it's not on Twitch is because I wanted 720.
[336.90s -> 338.90s]  And I don't have a partnership with Twitch.
[338.90s -> 343.90s]  I never plan on really getting a partnership because I of course have a machinima contract with live streaming, so...
[343.90s -> 347.34s]  I need to utilize it a little bit.
[347.34s -> 351.43s]  Can somebody do me a favor?
[351.43s -> 354.43s]  One of the mods I have in my typical Twitch stream.
[354.43s -> 357.43s]  Can somebody go over there and just tell them that the stream is over here?
[357.43s -> 362.49s]  Because my window is currently closed.
[362.49s -> 370.60s]  How?
[370.60s -> 373.67s]  Yah, I'll...
[373.67s -> 377.26s]  Somebody please go over there.
[377.26s -> 382.12s]  Streaming on the YouTubes.
[382.12s -> 385.49s]  I'm going to be streaming for a long time, so...
[385.49s -> 389.79s]  People will figure it out sooner or later I guess, right?
[389.79s -> 401.65s]  I'll probably be streaming for maybe half an hour, maybe 20 minutes.
[401.65s -> 407.10s]  Couple of rounds. I want to get a couple of good rounds though, that's the most important thing.
[407.10s -> 414.98s]  Let me get this thing rolling now.
[414.98s -> 417.98s]  Let's not tryharden as a scout.
[417.98s -> 420.73s]  Let's get this rolling. Here we go.
[420.73s -> 430.50s]  Nah, I mean Diablo 3 is taking over the streams.
[430.50s -> 432.50s]  By a large margin.
[432.50s -> 440.43s]  Well when I say taking over, I don't mean like...
[440.43s -> 442.43s]  It's not like taking over, but...
[442.43s -> 451.58s]  I got a bob. Bobarian.
[451.58s -> 455.28s]  Oh! Oh god.
[455.28s -> 457.28s]  Speaking of jag, I'm getting lag.
[457.28s -> 459.28s]  What rhymes with jag?
[459.28s -> 466.87s]  Oh, you see that? I threw the milk and it didn't even come out of my hand.
[466.87s -> 475.58s]  Oh, let's go.
[475.58s -> 476.58s]  Candy cake.
[476.58s -> 483.85s]  Yah, TwitchTV has a better chat system.
[483.85s -> 484.85s]  But this is 720.
[484.85s -> 488.85s]  And no, I just wanted my Diablo 3 videos to be in 720.
[488.85s -> 494.67s]  For the most part at least.
[494.67s -> 495.67s]  Oh!
[495.67s -> 505.40s]  Oh, where you going? Where you going?
[505.40s -> 508.98s]  Nah, we're doing it. Nah, we're doing it.
[508.98s -> 510.99s]  Oh!
[510.99s -> 513.99s]  That was like a goomba stomp with the scouter gun. You guys see that?
[513.99s -> 514.99s]  Ow.
[514.99s -> 520.28s]  Jerma, killer of steam, is back.
[520.28s -> 525.72s]  Yeah, it's not a...
[525.72s -> 527.72s]  Everyone's pings look okay.
[527.72s -> 532.20s]  I think it's the server we're on.
[532.20s -> 535.20s]  Yeah, it's definitely too many people at the same time.
[535.20s -> 547.15s]  Hey, we gotta stop it.
[547.15s -> 549.67s]  Damn.
[549.67s -> 556.32s]  I can see the YouTube comments. I have a little pop-up window that comes up where I can see whatever you guys are saying.
[556.32s -> 559.32s]  Say something in this video that could become a real viral saying.
[559.32s -> 561.88s]  Umm...
[561.88s -> 566.40s]  I want Burger Boy to go viral.
[566.40s -> 569.70s]  I want Burger Boy's entire presence to be viral.
[569.70s -> 571.70s]  But I don't know if that'll ever happen.
[571.70s -> 575.90s]  Yes, this will all be uploaded to YouTube. Probably tomorrow afternoon.
[575.90s -> 579.81s]  Oh, God.
[579.81s -> 582.30s]  That lag.
[582.30s -> 586.21s]  Alright, I'm gonna appear offline now.
[586.21s -> 590.66s]  I think it's just too many people trying to join at the same time.
[590.66s -> 593.48s]  But yes, Burger Boy 2012.
[593.48s -> 600.28s]  Actually, no, let me rephrase that. It's Burger Boy 2012.
[600.28s -> 602.28s]  Emperor of Earth.
[602.28s -> 608.49s]  That's the hashtag.
[608.49s -> 612.73s]  Alright, let's see if we can get a good string of non-lag here.
[612.73s -> 615.61s]  God, they're gonna push it. We're dead.
[615.61s -> 621.30s]  No, this is not good.
[621.30s -> 625.21s]  That's a dead ring for sure.
[625.21s -> 632.38s]  We all okay up there?
[632.38s -> 634.38s]  You are a spy.
[634.38s -> 638.09s]  We don't have a medic, do we? I might have to go medic.
[638.09s -> 640.46s]  Germa, say...what do you want me to say?
[640.46s -> 643.46s]  Alpha...I missed it. Alpha something, something, something.
[643.46s -> 650.42s]  God, that's such a laggy shot. I shot him five seconds later he got hit.
[650.42s -> 656.40s]  Oh, God. Oh, God.
[656.40s -> 658.90s]  Oh, God, I'm dead.
[658.90s -> 661.29s]  Oh, my word.
[661.29s -> 665.00s]  I'm watching Germa and eating brownies.
[665.00s -> 669.52s]  Brownies are good, man. I love brownies.
[669.52s -> 676.70s]  So, if Burger Boy was president of the United States of America,
[676.70s -> 679.88s]  what do you think his first legislature would be?
[679.88s -> 684.36s]  Spy over here. I just saw him.
[684.36s -> 685.36s]  Oh, no, is it soldier actually?
[685.36s -> 687.36s]  That guy just floated.
[687.36s -> 693.12s]  So, reserve shooter is becoming my default.
[693.12s -> 695.36s]  I love this thing.
[695.36s -> 700.54s]  Oh, no.
[700.54s -> 702.78s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[702.78s -> 706.37s]  Oh, God, this is bad.
[706.37s -> 708.37s]  He's gonna kill me.
[708.37s -> 714.83s]  God, give me the health.
[714.83s -> 716.83s]  Oh, good spy, good spy.
[716.83s -> 719.39s]  Good backstab.
[719.39s -> 725.05s]  Oh, good medic, good medic.
[725.05s -> 727.05s]  Oh, heal me, help me.
[727.05s -> 730.53s]  Oh, I'm gonna die.
[730.53s -> 737.03s]  Too many things going on at the same time.
[737.03s -> 738.03s]  Do some market gardening.
[738.03s -> 741.03s]  I'm so bad with the market gardener. I'm terrible.
[741.03s -> 744.74s]  Me, market gardening is like...
[744.74s -> 752.62s]  I'd rather watch paint dry. I'm terrible. I'm like so bad.
[752.62s -> 756.62s]  Stand on the freaking point, you moron. Stand on it.
[756.62s -> 764.40s]  I didn't get the kill, did I?
[764.40s -> 770.99s]  Oh, shoot it at me again.
[770.99s -> 771.99s]  Damn.
[771.99s -> 774.38s]  Where's grandpa?
[774.38s -> 777.38s]  Grandpa, you want me to get him?
[777.38s -> 784.32s]  I'll get grandpa after this round.
[784.32s -> 786.62s]  The heavy.
[786.62s -> 788.62s]  That would be the heavy.
[788.62s -> 799.25s]  Oh, random crits. Ow.
[799.25s -> 802.00s]  My body.
[802.00s -> 803.00s]  Gamer class is engineer.
[803.00s -> 810.77s]  I haven't been playing a whole lot of engineer though.
[810.77s -> 812.77s]  I've not been playing really any engineer.
[812.77s -> 813.77s]  I don't know why either.
[813.77s -> 816.39s]  And we're gonna lose the game.
[816.39s -> 819.39s]  I'm ready. People are gonna walk right by me. Watch this.
[819.39s -> 822.89s]  People are gonna walk right by me.
[822.89s -> 828.67s]  Hey.
[828.67s -> 832.45s]  Oh my god.
[832.45s -> 836.80s]  That kill feed.
[836.80s -> 843.83s]  Oh, so by the way, those of you that were at the stream a couple weeks ago,
[843.83s -> 849.83s]  during the whole debacle where people can see through the backpack, the game show event,
[849.83s -> 856.83s]  I wanted to clarify that Optimus Prime, he could see the backpack,
[856.83s -> 859.83s]  and he wanted to make sure that it didn't get stolen,
[859.83s -> 861.83s]  because he's obviously a mod on the stream.
[861.83s -> 863.83s]  Optimus Prime is not a thief.
[863.83s -> 865.83s]  Oh god, I'm lagging.
[865.83s -> 868.65s]  He is not a thief.
[868.65s -> 872.65s]  He did that in the merits of his own heart to try and protect the unusual hat.
[872.65s -> 874.65s]  Oh my god, I can't even walk.
[874.65s -> 877.89s]  Yeah, I can't even walk either. What the hell is going on?
[881.88s -> 889.28s]  Maybe if we all crouch, the lag will go away.
[889.28s -> 893.28s]  If you're wondering, I am working on a new solution
[893.28s -> 897.28s]  to figure out how to do another stream like that and have it work.
[897.28s -> 900.90s]  I mean, it worked. It was okay after the first 15 or 20 minutes,
[900.90s -> 905.46s]  but there were a lot of issues, and I will figure them out.
[905.46s -> 909.46s]  And I'm gonna get overcharged right out the gate, and I'm gonna mess something up here.
[909.46s -> 912.34s]  I'm gonna be like Sir Derpington.
[912.34s -> 915.34s]  When you hit this on me, if you're gonna hit it on me...
[915.34s -> 917.34s]  Actually, don't do it yet. Sit right here.
[917.34s -> 919.34s]  Sit right here. We're gonna hide.
[919.34s -> 921.34s]  We're gonna hide right here.
[921.34s -> 924.84s]  We're gonna eat cookies and pancakes until they come out.
[924.84s -> 926.84s]  No, no, hold it. Hold it. Hold it.
[926.84s -> 929.59s]  Okay, go! Woohoo!
[929.59s -> 931.59s]  Oh dear god.
[932.59s -> 934.59s]  Oh, how is he not dead?
[934.59s -> 938.28s]  How many Ubers did we just have out the gate? You kidding me?
[938.28s -> 945.26s]  That was like... Holy crap, that was a lot of people.
[947.90s -> 954.61s]  Soup can!
[954.61s -> 956.81s]  Oh god.
[956.81s -> 959.81s]  So after this round, I'm probably gonna move on to my own server,
[959.81s -> 964.18s]  because it's just like chaos.
[964.18s -> 969.46s]  I think too many people are trying to connect at the same time.
[969.46s -> 970.46s]  What is it?
[970.46s -> 971.46s]  Every time I hear... Let me tell you...
[971.46s -> 973.46s]  Agree in the comments if you agree with this.
[973.46s -> 976.46s]  So every time I hear the ambassador shot,
[976.46s -> 981.46s]  that like boom, boom, I always think it's not on our team.
[981.46s -> 983.83s]  Oh my god.
[985.39s -> 987.57s]  I like broke his legs.
[987.57s -> 991.57s]  Oh, this is gonna be bad. Bad news for everybody on the cot.
[991.57s -> 998.52s]  Oh, good backstab. Good backstab.
[998.52s -> 1001.17s]  Come at you.
[1001.17s -> 1003.41s]  Oh god!
[1003.41s -> 1004.58s]  Hide.
[1004.58s -> 1009.45s]  He's still alive. He's right here.
[1009.45s -> 1013.74s]  Oh, dead ring and bastard.
[1013.74s -> 1016.74s]  Well, that was... Okay.
[1016.74s -> 1017.74s]  Ugh!
[1017.74s -> 1020.18s]  Don't let him get away!
[1020.18s -> 1022.74s]  He's gonna get away.
[1022.74s -> 1026.30s]  Oh god, it's like lagging all over the place.
[1026.30s -> 1027.30s]  Alright.
[1027.30s -> 1028.30s]  Run!
[1028.30s -> 1029.30s]  Run away!
[1029.30s -> 1030.79s]  Alright.
[1030.79s -> 1035.40s]  Now they think we're running away?
[1035.40s -> 1037.98s]  Oh god.
[1037.98s -> 1038.98s]  No!
[1038.98s -> 1040.16s]  Hey, it was a good run.
[1040.16s -> 1041.16s]  It was a good run.
[1041.16s -> 1044.10s]  It was a good run.
[1044.10s -> 1050.78s]  Ambassador.
[1050.78s -> 1052.09s]  Or backstab too.
[1052.09s -> 1054.09s]  Whenever I hear the backstab sound, that...
[1054.09s -> 1055.09s]  I always go...
[1055.09s -> 1058.09s]  I freak out and I turn around and look around all over the place.
[1058.09s -> 1065.90s]  And he spies over there.
[1065.90s -> 1072.51s]  Oh god, spam everywhere.
[1072.51s -> 1073.51s]  What just happened?
[1073.51s -> 1075.75s]  Did I kill that guy?
[1075.75s -> 1077.12s]  What?
[1077.12s -> 1080.36s]  Oh, Optimus Prime backstabbed him. Okay.
[1080.36s -> 1083.94s]  Oh, you need one more shot and you're dead.
[1083.94s -> 1088.49s]  No, get out of my face!
[1088.49s -> 1089.49s]  Ugh!
[1089.49s -> 1091.05s]  Thank you.
[1091.05s -> 1094.40s]  For healing me.
[1094.40s -> 1095.40s]  That's a spy.
[1095.40s -> 1096.40s]  That's definitely a spy.
[1096.40s -> 1100.75s]  Aw, I'm trying to reflect it.
[1100.75s -> 1103.50s]  Get this help over here, bro.
[1103.50s -> 1104.50s]  There you go, buddy.
[1104.50s -> 1108.00s]  Oh, they know we're in here. This is not good.
[1108.00s -> 1109.24s]  That's a spy.
[1109.24s -> 1110.24s]  No, it's not.
[1110.24s -> 1113.18s]  Oh lord!
[1116.38s -> 1117.38s]  Oh no.
[1117.38s -> 1119.38s]  Uber charge.
[1119.38s -> 1124.74s]  Oh, just die.
[1124.74s -> 1125.74s]  No, just...
[1125.74s -> 1128.30s]  Die!
[1128.30s -> 1131.30s]  All I cared about was killing that guy and I didn't even get him.
[1131.30s -> 1136.06s]  Aw, damn.
[1136.06s -> 1142.66s]  Aw, at least I got the pyro.
[1142.66s -> 1146.18s]  At least I got the pyro.
[1146.18s -> 1151.28s]  Let's go, let's go sniper.
[1151.28s -> 1152.28s]  He'll never get me.
[1152.28s -> 1157.85s]  Spy.
[1157.85s -> 1158.85s]  Sappin Mountain Spencer.
[1158.85s -> 1161.66s]  Favorite weapon in Team Fortress 2?
[1161.66s -> 1164.74s]  Probably... uh-oh.
[1164.74s -> 1167.74s]  Let us take a moment to mourn the loss of this sniper.
[1167.74s -> 1173.04s]  He was a good man and all he wanted to do was just snipe
[1173.04s -> 1175.04s]  and kill and melee.
[1175.04s -> 1177.04s]  I was actually hoping I was gonna get backstabbed.
[1177.04s -> 1179.04s]  That was like the whole point there.
[1179.04s -> 1181.04s]  I was hoping I was gonna get backstabbed.
[1181.04s -> 1185.01s]  Fire, fire, fire.
[1185.01s -> 1188.17s]  I just heard it.
[1188.17s -> 1189.17s]  Where is he?
[1189.17s -> 1194.16s]  Ah, I thought I was gonna run into that.
[1194.16s -> 1196.85s]  Oh god, they're everywhere.
[1196.85s -> 1201.20s]  Oh, get away from me.
[1201.20s -> 1203.20s]  Crush him, crush him.
[1203.20s -> 1209.40s]  Strategy that I never really talk about is the freak out melee.
[1209.40s -> 1211.40s]  It actually works more times than you'd think.
[1211.40s -> 1213.40s]  Oh god.
[1213.40s -> 1215.79s]  Ow.
[1215.79s -> 1218.25s]  Hello.
[1218.25s -> 1221.00s]  Hold on, that came from Optimus Prime.
[1221.00s -> 1223.00s]  What the hell was that?
[1223.00s -> 1227.26s]  Optimus Prime just like morphed into a woman for a minute there.
[1227.26s -> 1232.09s]  Yeah.
[1232.09s -> 1237.94s]  Did you?
[1237.94s -> 1239.94s]  You son of a... you bastard.
[1239.94s -> 1240.94s]  Oh, I thought that was actually a spy.
[1240.94s -> 1241.94s]  That was funny.
[1241.94s -> 1243.94s]  You ducked from my arrow.
[1243.94s -> 1250.10s]  Ah.
[1250.10s -> 1251.10s]  Kill him.
[1251.10s -> 1252.10s]  Kill him.
[1252.10s -> 1253.10s]  Chaos.
[1253.10s -> 1254.10s]  Ah.
[1254.10s -> 1257.20s]  I lost.
[1257.20s -> 1260.45s]  I lose.
[1260.45s -> 1261.45s]  I lose.
[1261.45s -> 1265.33s]  He's been a woman the whole time.
[1265.33s -> 1268.62s]  Where am I?
[1268.62s -> 1271.37s]  I'm actually not doing too terribly.
[1271.37s -> 1279.18s]  For as laggy as this is being.
[1279.18s -> 1280.18s]  Doctor!
[1280.18s -> 1284.55s]  Don't worry.
[1284.55s -> 1285.55s]  Oh my god.
[1285.55s -> 1287.50s]  Oh god.
[1287.50s -> 1289.50s]  It is so scary when I just bump into spies.
[1289.50s -> 1292.12s]  Then I bump into a second one.
[1292.12s -> 1293.12s]  Give me a headshot.
[1293.12s -> 1296.49s]  I refuse to put this thing away until I get a headshot.
[1296.49s -> 1299.14s]  Come on.
[1299.14s -> 1300.14s]  Aw.
[1300.14s -> 1305.54s]  Damn.
[1305.54s -> 1310.98s]  Alright, you want the Boston Basher on there?
[1310.98s -> 1312.98s]  I don't even think I have it.
[1312.98s -> 1315.34s]  No, I don't even have the Boston Basher.
[1315.34s -> 1318.93s]  I don't even have the Boston Basher.
[1318.93s -> 1322.37s]  I'm not used to it.
[1322.37s -> 1323.37s]  Oh my word.
[1323.37s -> 1325.50s]  Wait a second.
[1325.50s -> 1326.50s]  Wait a second.
[1326.50s -> 1327.50s]  Wait a second.
[1327.50s -> 1328.50s]  I just shot by him.
[1328.50s -> 1330.87s]  And killed the spy that was behind him.
[1330.87s -> 1334.16s]  Alright, there we go.
[1334.16s -> 1335.16s]  That's three.
[1335.16s -> 1336.34s]  Let me get a quad.
[1336.34s -> 1341.65s]  No, no, no, no.
[1341.65s -> 1342.95s]  Damn.
[1342.95s -> 1346.54s]  I just freaked out right there.
[1346.54s -> 1348.16s]  Medic.
[1348.16s -> 1351.00s]  Freak out, smash.
[1351.00s -> 1352.00s]  Freak out, smash.
[1352.00s -> 1353.00s]  It always works.
[1353.00s -> 1354.00s]  It always works.
[1354.00s -> 1355.56s]  I told you.
[1355.56s -> 1358.57s]  As long as you just freak out.
[1358.57s -> 1362.57s]  If you freak the hell out and start swinging at somebody, you probably will kill him.
[1362.57s -> 1367.99s]  Oh, that's a crit screen.
[1368.99s -> 1369.99s]  Chaos.
[1369.99s -> 1372.36s]  It's going to be, it's going to work.
[1372.36s -> 1374.92s]  When all else fails.
[1374.92s -> 1375.92s]  When all else fails.
[1375.92s -> 1376.92s]  Chaos.
[1376.92s -> 1378.29s]  Smash.
[1378.29s -> 1379.29s]  When all else fails.
[1379.29s -> 1380.29s]  Chaos.
[1380.29s -> 1381.29s]  Chaos.
[1381.29s -> 1382.29s]  Smash.
[1389.59s -> 1391.59s]  No, no, hear me.
[1391.59s -> 1395.69s]  What's up, potato fryer?
[1395.69s -> 1402.02s]  How you doing, my man?
[1402.02s -> 1404.02s]  You can't beat the chaos.
[1404.02s -> 1407.18s]  Smash.
[1407.18s -> 1410.18s]  Alright, one more, one more little life here with this huntsman.
[1410.18s -> 1412.18s]  And wait, is somebody on the cart?
[1412.18s -> 1413.81s]  Going up top.
[1413.81s -> 1416.05s]  I'm going up top.
[1416.05s -> 1420.36s]  Yeah.
[1420.36s -> 1424.14s]  Just shoot down this hallway, man.
[1424.14s -> 1425.14s]  I'll kill somebody.
[1425.14s -> 1426.14s]  I'm bumping into a spy, too.
[1426.14s -> 1428.14s]  I don't have Jurati.
[1428.14s -> 1429.63s]  There he is.
[1429.63s -> 1433.02s]  Oh, god.
[1433.02s -> 1434.78s]  What?
[1434.78s -> 1436.78s]  How many spies do they have on their team?
[1436.78s -> 1445.99s]  Alright, I think I'm going to try.
[1445.99s -> 1447.99s]  See, here's like the big joke.
[1447.99s -> 1449.99s]  See, listen to this, ready?
[1449.99s -> 1451.99s]  So my server is full right now, right?
[1451.99s -> 1454.99s]  And I can't even get into it.
[1454.99s -> 1459.36s]  I have reserve slots set up for myself, but apparently it doesn't work.
[1459.36s -> 1461.36s]  I guess not.
[1461.36s -> 1465.88s]  So I'm going to try and do this again and see if it works.
[1465.88s -> 1468.95s]  And let's see what happens.
[1468.95s -> 1474.20s]  Yeah, see, server is full.
[1474.20s -> 1475.20s]  I have a reserve slot.
[1475.20s -> 1477.20s]  I'm probably doing it wrong.
[1477.20s -> 1478.20s]  Who knows?
[1478.20s -> 1479.20s]  But I'm changing servers.
[1479.20s -> 1482.53s]  We're going to go somewhere else.
[1482.53s -> 1485.53s]  I would go in my server, but there's no way I'm going to get in.
[1485.53s -> 1488.34s]  I can't even get into my own server.
[1488.34s -> 1494.86s]  No, this is like, I'm knocking on the door to my own house.
[1494.86s -> 1498.86s]  And there's like a party going on in my house.
[1498.86s -> 1500.86s]  That's pretty much the equivalent of this.
[1500.86s -> 1504.86s]  There is like a crazy party going on in my house right now.
[1504.86s -> 1506.86s]  They're like breaking vases.
[1506.86s -> 1508.86s]  Somebody's like puking in the bathroom.
[1508.86s -> 1510.86s]  And I'm outside just staring at the house.
[1510.86s -> 1512.86s]  That's pretty much what's going on.
[1512.86s -> 1514.86s]  I can't get it.
[1514.86s -> 1517.30s]  Wait, I can't get it.
[1517.30s -> 1526.26s]  I can't get it.
[1526.26s -> 1534.19s]  Wait, connect, you rip?
[1534.19s -> 1537.01s]  What is that?
[1537.01s -> 1538.01s]  Oh, your IP.
[1538.01s -> 1539.01s]  Yeah, I just tried it.
[1539.01s -> 1540.01s]  I don't know.
[1540.01s -> 1541.01s]  I have it set up.
[1541.01s -> 1542.95s]  It doesn't work.
[1542.95s -> 1543.95s]  I'll try it one more time.
[1543.95s -> 1545.70s]  Ready?
[1545.70s -> 1546.70s]  Connect.
[1546.70s -> 1547.70s]  Here's the IP.
[1547.70s -> 1548.70s]  Server is full.
[1548.70s -> 1553.14s]  And I have a reserve slot.
[1553.14s -> 1554.14s]  I don't want to be a jerk.
[1554.14s -> 1560.33s]  That's my own fault for not having it set up right.
[1560.33s -> 1564.98s]  Party at Jerma's, but he's not invited.
[1564.98s -> 1566.98s]  I'm not invited to my own party.
[1566.98s -> 1572.72s]  Oh, I want to check something.
[1572.72s -> 1578.44s]  I got to drop that down.
[1578.44s -> 1579.44s]  I do play on Shibby's server.
[1579.44s -> 1581.44s]  I mean, now that I have my server, I kind of...
[1581.44s -> 1584.44s]  I try to stay on that as much as I can.
[1584.44s -> 1589.69s]  Who's on here?
[1589.69s -> 1591.69s]  Is anybody on there that I know?
[1591.69s -> 1594.02s]  Nope.
[1594.02s -> 1596.75s]  All right, new server.
[1596.75s -> 1600.75s]  So what's going to happen now is because my house is full of people at a party.
[1600.75s -> 1606.75s]  We're going to go to somebody else's house that is not having a party right now.
[1606.75s -> 1613.46s]  So let's go.
[1613.46s -> 1614.46s]  Let's see.
[1614.46s -> 1616.82s]  No, not RTD.
[1616.82s -> 1623.58s]  After this, I'm probably going to play some Diablo 3.
[1623.58s -> 1625.58s]  So here's the IP.
[1625.58s -> 1629.58s]  If somebody wants to paste that into the chat, it's right there.
[1629.58s -> 1632.58s]  Because if I do it, it's going to get swarmed.
[1632.58s -> 1634.58s]  So post that into the chat.
[1634.58s -> 1640.68s]  By the way, turn on automatic updates for the chat.
[1640.68s -> 1642.68s]  That'll help it with the reload time.
[1642.68s -> 1643.68s]  But that is the IP.
[1643.68s -> 1646.68s]  If somebody want to link that, I would be appreciated.
[1646.68s -> 1648.68s]  I would be appreciative, not appreciated.
[1648.68s -> 1653.84s]  I bet you Burger Boy the dump machine is there.
[1653.84s -> 1655.34s]  Oh, yeah, I forgot.
[1655.34s -> 1656.34s]  Let me get Grandpa.
[1656.34s -> 1657.34s]  Hold on.
[1657.34s -> 1659.02s]  Hey, yo, Grandpa.
[1659.02s -> 1661.39s]  Get down here.
[1661.39s -> 1665.60s]  We want to talk to you.
[1665.60s -> 1667.60s]  Who wants to talk to me?
[1667.60s -> 1669.29s]  Who wants to talk to me?
[1669.29s -> 1670.29s]  Let me sit here.
[1670.29s -> 1671.29s]  Sit down.
[1671.29s -> 1672.29s]  I'm sitting.
[1672.29s -> 1673.29s]  I told you I'm already sitting.
[1673.29s -> 1675.30s]  Okay.
[1675.30s -> 1676.30s]  All right.
[1676.30s -> 1679.30s]  It's question and answer time with Grandpa.
[1679.30s -> 1682.30s]  So what do you want to ask me?
[1682.30s -> 1687.94s]  In the comment section, make sure you ask a good question,
[1687.94s -> 1689.94s]  or I'm going to punch you in the face,
[1689.94s -> 1691.94s]  and you're going to bleed.
[1691.94s -> 1696.23s]  Let's play some Red Team.
[1696.23s -> 1701.03s]  Wait, how come I'm not invited to the party?
[1701.03s -> 1702.03s]  Where's there a party?
[1702.03s -> 1704.98s]  Who didn't invite me to the party?
[1704.98s -> 1706.98s]  I'm the best son of a bitch here.
[1706.98s -> 1708.98s]  I'm going to play engineer for a second here.
[1708.98s -> 1710.98s]  Put this down.
[1710.98s -> 1711.98s]  Put it right here against the wall.
[1711.98s -> 1713.98s]  Because you never know, there could be a spy
[1713.98s -> 1715.98s]  that's going to come around this corner here
[1715.98s -> 1717.98s]  and try and get the spawn.
[1717.98s -> 1719.98s]  So I'm going to put that at the spawn door
[1719.98s -> 1721.98s]  to make sure no spies get it.
[1721.98s -> 1723.98s]  What the hell is going on with this lag?
[1723.98s -> 1725.86s]  Oh!
[1725.86s -> 1729.87s]  Oh!
[1729.87s -> 1731.87s]  What the hell is going on here?
[1731.87s -> 1736.22s]  This is the laggiest piece of crap server
[1736.22s -> 1741.45s]  I've ever played out of my entire life.
[1741.45s -> 1742.45s]  Oh!
[1742.45s -> 1744.33s]  How old am I?
[1744.33s -> 1746.33s]  Somebody want to know how old I am?
[1746.33s -> 1747.33s]  I am...
[1747.33s -> 1749.33s]  You'll never know.
[1749.33s -> 1752.82s]  You're never going to find out how old I am.
[1752.82s -> 1756.24s]  Let me get this century...
[1756.24s -> 1758.24s]  Help me get this century to level three.
[1758.24s -> 1759.24s]  While the lags...
[1759.24s -> 1761.24s]  While the server lags out.
[1761.24s -> 1762.99s]  What?
[1762.99s -> 1763.99s]  How does that actually work?
[1763.99s -> 1764.99s]  Oh, he's right there.
[1764.99s -> 1765.99s]  Get him.
[1765.99s -> 1768.81s]  You want me to high five you?
[1768.81s -> 1771.43s]  You're not getting a high five from me.
[1771.43s -> 1776.43s]  Well, my birthday is June 15th, 1918.
[1776.43s -> 1782.23s]  So if you can figure that out for yourself, go ahead.
[1782.23s -> 1783.23s]  What is this game?
[1783.23s -> 1784.23s]  Why is it even happening?
[1784.23s -> 1785.23s]  Where do I go?
[1785.23s -> 1788.50s]  I don't even know where to go in this game.
[1788.50s -> 1791.50s]  I just know you build a century here to protect the spawn
[1791.50s -> 1793.50s]  from those bastard spies.
[1793.50s -> 1797.64s]  And I'm thirsty, too.
[1797.64s -> 1799.64s]  What the hell is on this guy's head?
[1799.64s -> 1801.64s]  What is that?
[1801.64s -> 1804.82s]  You look like a freaking Nordic god or something.
[1804.82s -> 1805.82s]  Get away from me.
[1805.82s -> 1807.82s]  You're freaking me out.
[1807.82s -> 1812.81s]  All right, well, this server lags too much.
[1812.81s -> 1815.81s]  So I'll pull this over here.
[1815.81s -> 1817.24s]  And he's going to...
[1817.24s -> 1819.24s]  Right here is a good spot for the century.
[1819.24s -> 1821.74s]  Century going up over here, boys.
[1821.74s -> 1823.74s]  It's a good spot for it.
[1823.74s -> 1828.49s]  And then the dispenser is going to go, like, over here.
[1828.49s -> 1829.49s]  Ah!
[1829.49s -> 1831.73s]  Suspect, you're going to go right there.
[1831.73s -> 1834.73s]  And then the century shoot people.
[1834.73s -> 1837.48s]  And I'm lagging out way too bad.
[1837.48s -> 1839.48s]  This is the worst server ever.
[1839.48s -> 1843.70s]  Do I get all the bitches?
[1843.70s -> 1845.14s]  Yes.
[1845.14s -> 1847.14s]  Absolutely yes.
[1847.14s -> 1850.95s]  You might think because I'm old, I don't have any, uh...
[1850.95s -> 1853.45s]  I don't have any Lubino left,
[1853.45s -> 1856.45s]  but you'd be totally wrong when you put that statement.
[1856.45s -> 1859.90s]  So if I kill two people, then I leave.
[1859.90s -> 1862.90s]  And I've already killed one, so let's get another kill.
[1862.90s -> 1863.90s]  Come on.
[1863.90s -> 1866.30s]  What are you...
[1866.30s -> 1867.30s]  Get out of here!
[1867.30s -> 1869.30s]  You're making me show up on the radar.
[1869.30s -> 1871.30s]  This is like Modern Warfare, right?
[1871.30s -> 1875.18s]  The more you shoot, the more you show up on the radar, right?
[1875.18s -> 1878.98s]  Where is the radar?
[1878.98s -> 1879.98s]  What are you two doing?
[1879.98s -> 1881.98s]  Go fight the battle!
[1881.98s -> 1883.66s]  You guys need to fight the war!
[1883.66s -> 1887.16s]  What are you doing hitting the thing around here?
[1887.16s -> 1889.16s]  Somebody challenge you to a duel.
[1889.16s -> 1891.81s]  What is that?
[1891.81s -> 1898.32s]  What's that do?
[1898.32s -> 1899.32s]  Second kill!
[1899.32s -> 1900.32s]  I got a second kill.
[1900.32s -> 1903.32s]  That means I can leave and put this century down here
[1903.32s -> 1905.32s]  for a suicide century.
[1905.32s -> 1909.50s]  There we go.
[1909.50s -> 1912.68s]  This is the best part of the game right here.
[1912.68s -> 1917.38s]  This is where you get all the kills.
[1917.38s -> 1918.38s]  Come at me!
[1918.38s -> 1919.38s]  Somebody come at me!
[1919.38s -> 1921.68s]  Look at this century doing work.
[1921.68s -> 1924.68s]  You're a F-U-C-K-I-N-G spy.
[1924.68s -> 1926.68s]  I'm not allowed to swear on these streams.
[1926.68s -> 1929.68s]  Jeremy told me I'd get in trouble, so I can't do that.
[1929.68s -> 1935.52s]  Grandpa, have you ever gone to the bathroom two times a day before?
[1935.52s -> 1936.52s]  Yes.
[1936.52s -> 1938.89s]  I actually go to the bathroom...
[1938.89s -> 1939.89s]  What's going on?
[1939.89s -> 1941.89s]  What's going on with that century gun?
[1941.89s -> 1945.34s]  Yeah, look out for that bastard spy.
[1945.34s -> 1946.34s]  He's a Frenchman.
[1946.34s -> 1948.34s]  All Frenchmen are bastards.
[1948.34s -> 1949.34s]  We all know that.
[1949.34s -> 1952.52s]  They're all sneaky, and they steal your stuff,
[1952.52s -> 1955.52s]  and they love your women.
[1955.52s -> 1958.95s]  What the hell just happened?
[1958.95s -> 1963.93s]  What just happened to me?
[1963.93s -> 1965.93s]  Oh, I'm out of here.
[1965.93s -> 1968.10s]  I'm getting the fuck out of here.
[1968.10s -> 1970.10s]  This game sucks.
[1970.10s -> 1972.54s]  Not playing this game again, Jeremy.
[1972.54s -> 1974.54s]  This game sucks.
[1976.61s -> 1979.87s]  You need to go take a nap, anyways.
[1979.87s -> 1981.87s]  You've been up a little too long.
[1981.87s -> 1985.39s]  You've been up a little too long, Grandpa.
[1985.39s -> 1992.62s]  Somebody keeps repairing that century, by the way.
[1992.62s -> 1996.76s]  I didn't even know I was in a duel.
[1996.76s -> 2000.73s]  I think you're a spy, but I could...
[2000.73s -> 2001.73s]  Yeah, I was right.
[2001.73s -> 2002.73s]  I was right.
[2002.73s -> 2005.10s]  I was right all along,
[2005.10s -> 2008.10s]  and I cannot land a shot to save my life right now.
[2008.10s -> 2011.38s]  There you go.
[2011.38s -> 2014.07s]  Are you a spy?
[2014.07s -> 2017.38s]  No, but I'll high-five you anyways.
[2019.19s -> 2020.19s]  Yeah.
[2020.19s -> 2022.88s]  Whoa.
[2022.88s -> 2024.88s]  How did he even get me?
[2024.88s -> 2027.88s]  I was too busy choking on my own throat.
[2027.88s -> 2039.42s]  Is the lag in the game unbearable to watch in the stream,
[2039.42s -> 2040.42s]  or is it okay?
[2040.42s -> 2043.42s]  How does it look in the actual stream window?
[2043.42s -> 2046.26s]  Oh, my God.
[2046.26s -> 2047.26s]  Chaos.
[2047.26s -> 2049.62s]  Remember what I taught you guys.
[2049.62s -> 2050.62s]  Chaos.
[2050.62s -> 2057.07s]  Chaos.
[2064.09s -> 2068.53s]  Unlapped.
[2068.53s -> 2072.20s]  I'm just going to go wrench.
[2072.20s -> 2073.20s]  I'm just going to wrench people in the face.
[2073.20s -> 2075.82s]  That's all I'm going to do.
[2075.82s -> 2076.82s]  There's a guy right here.
[2076.82s -> 2080.28s]  I'm not going to get that scout, ever.
[2080.28s -> 2085.49s]  Ugh.
[2085.49s -> 2086.49s]  I'm waiting.
[2086.49s -> 2087.49s]  I'm waiting for someone to jump over here
[2087.49s -> 2088.49s]  so I can just...
[2088.49s -> 2090.62s]  I'm going to freak somebody out.
[2090.62s -> 2091.62s]  Ready?
[2091.62s -> 2094.27s]  Let's do this.
[2094.27s -> 2096.27s]  I want someone to walk out and land on this.
[2096.27s -> 2098.27s]  Oh, my God.
[2098.27s -> 2103.01s]  Ugh.
[2103.01s -> 2112.22s]  It's coward killing time.
[2112.22s -> 2119.46s]  I am a derpington.
[2119.46s -> 2120.46s]  I really am.
[2120.46s -> 2121.46s]  Whenever I do these live streams,
[2121.46s -> 2123.46s]  my brain shuts off,
[2123.46s -> 2125.46s]  because I'm looking at the chat talking,
[2125.46s -> 2126.46s]  and I'm doing like...
[2126.46s -> 2128.46s]  Like, where's your head?
[2128.46s -> 2131.78s]  I feel like I just bought the game.
[2131.78s -> 2134.34s]  Bring back those memories.
[2134.34s -> 2139.21s]  Let's get this sentry up.
[2139.21s -> 2142.39s]  At least a little bit.
[2142.39s -> 2143.39s]  I'm not even protecting it.
[2143.39s -> 2144.39s]  I'm just running away from it
[2144.39s -> 2145.39s]  every time it goes up.
[2145.39s -> 2149.06s]  There we go.
[2149.06s -> 2151.06s]  I really do think...
[2151.06s -> 2153.06s]  If you're watching this on YouTube right now,
[2153.06s -> 2155.06s]  did I get more melee kills
[2155.06s -> 2157.06s]  than...
[2157.06s -> 2159.06s]  Are you serious?
[2159.06s -> 2160.43s]  I'm getting...
[2160.43s -> 2161.43s]  I don't think I've killed anybody
[2161.43s -> 2162.43s]  with anything else besides melee
[2162.43s -> 2163.43s]  this entire time.
[2163.43s -> 2164.43s]  Maybe I killed, like,
[2164.43s -> 2165.43s]  four people with the Huntsman.
[2165.43s -> 2166.43s]  Did I kill anybody
[2166.43s -> 2169.43s]  with anything else besides melee?
[2169.43s -> 2175.58s]  Medic!
[2175.58s -> 2182.42s]  Why am I not streaming on Twitch?
[2182.42s -> 2184.66s]  Because...
[2184.66s -> 2186.66s]  I can't do 720 on Twitch.
[2186.66s -> 2188.97s]  And we're lagging again.
[2188.97s -> 2190.97s]  So I'm gonna disconnect from this server.
[2190.97s -> 2195.51s]  So I'm gonna go on a random server
[2195.51s -> 2198.33s]  so that nobody can see the IP,
[2198.33s -> 2199.33s]  because I think what the problem
[2199.33s -> 2200.33s]  is happening right now
[2200.33s -> 2202.33s]  is we keep on crashing servers out,
[2202.33s -> 2204.33s]  because too many people are getting the IP.
[2204.33s -> 2206.33s]  So let's just go to...
[2206.33s -> 2210.54s]  I'm gonna take it off screen.
[2210.54s -> 2212.54s]  I'm gonna take it off of this screen.
[2212.54s -> 2218.54s]  What's going on here?
[2218.54s -> 2224.62s]  Let's see.
[2224.62s -> 2229.35s]  Let's find a map I like.
[2229.35s -> 2231.35s]  We'll play in some gravel pit.
[2231.35s -> 2233.35s]  No, we won't. Yes, we will.
[2233.35s -> 2235.35s]  No, we won't. Yes, we will.
[2241.43s -> 2243.93s]  What is that hat with the Eiffel Tower?
[2243.93s -> 2245.93s]  We are all highly intrigued.
[2245.93s -> 2247.93s]  And I looked, I can't find it in the store.
[2247.93s -> 2249.93s]  Oh, yeah, the...
[2249.93s -> 2251.93s]  Eiffel Tower hat from Kritzkast.
[2251.93s -> 2253.93s]  If you don't know Kritzkast,
[2253.93s -> 2255.93s]  it's a Team Fortress 2 podcast they do every week.
[2255.93s -> 2257.93s]  And every week they give out Player of the Week.
[2257.93s -> 2259.93s]  And I guess it's like a thing they do
[2259.93s -> 2261.93s]  where they find somebody that's doing
[2261.93s -> 2263.93s]  a lot of cool stuff,
[2263.93s -> 2265.93s]  or they're doing well, or something with competitive.
[2265.93s -> 2267.93s]  I'm not really exactly sure.
[2267.93s -> 2269.93s]  But I do know they give it out pretty much
[2269.93s -> 2271.93s]  every week, I think, to somebody else.
[2271.93s -> 2273.93s]  And I happen to get Player of the Week,
[2273.93s -> 2275.93s]  which that's awesome, and thank you to the Kritzkast guys
[2275.93s -> 2277.93s]  if you're watching this or if you're seeing this at some point.
[2277.93s -> 2279.93s]  Thank you for that, I much appreciate it,
[2279.93s -> 2281.93s]  that's awesome, thank you so much.
[2281.93s -> 2283.93s]  But that's where that hat came from, it's from the Kritzkast guys.
[2283.93s -> 2287.45s]  Alright, let's go to...
[2289.45s -> 2293.80s]  Gold Rush, this one, whatever it is.
[2293.80s -> 2295.80s]  Yeah, I want to get at least one
[2295.80s -> 2297.80s]  good non-laggy Team Fortress 2 game.
[2297.80s -> 2301.77s]  And it seems like every time we're...
[2301.77s -> 2303.77s]  I don't know, recently I don't know what's been going on.
[2303.77s -> 2305.77s]  Every time it's been...
[2305.77s -> 2307.77s]  The streams from a long time ago,
[2307.77s -> 2309.77s]  I've been doing streams for the last
[2309.77s -> 2311.77s]  four or five months. I've never seen
[2311.77s -> 2313.77s]  this problem before, and I used to give out IPs
[2313.77s -> 2315.77s]  like crazy. We would always just flood a server
[2315.77s -> 2318.20s]  and that stuff would never happen.
[2318.20s -> 2320.20s]  So I'm wondering, I'm wondering if something else is going on.
[2320.20s -> 2323.34s]  Who knows? But
[2323.34s -> 2325.34s]  I'm going to try and play a little bit of one more session
[2325.34s -> 2327.64s]  here with the...
[2327.64s -> 2330.78s]  Demoman.
[2330.78s -> 2334.49s]  I am appearing offline.
[2334.49s -> 2337.43s]  So I don't want to kill this person's
[2337.43s -> 2341.72s]  server. Thank you, doctor.
[2341.72s -> 2348.63s]  I've got my strange lock and load.
[2348.63s -> 2351.96s]  Oh, I thought he was going to back up into that.
[2351.96s -> 2355.16s]  Whoa, just barely.
[2355.16s -> 2359.77s]  Just barely.
[2359.77s -> 2364.36s]  Oh, I didn't get him. Almost got him.
[2364.36s -> 2366.36s]  Oh my god, I just barely dodged that crit rocket.
[2366.36s -> 2370.71s]  There's a sentry right there.
[2370.71s -> 2373.85s]  Oh, and
[2373.85s -> 2379.16s]  goodbye, sentry.
[2379.16s -> 2381.59s]  Oh, I'm going to be in trouble.
[2381.59s -> 2383.59s]  I need that medic, there's still stuff over there.
[2383.59s -> 2389.67s]  What happened to that medic?
[2389.67s -> 2392.54s]  Oh god.
[2392.54s -> 2394.78s]  I hate when that happens.
[2394.78s -> 2398.74s]  Bumped right into him,
[2398.74s -> 2400.74s]  shot him right in the face, instantly blew up myself.
[2400.74s -> 2402.74s]  I do that far too often,
[2402.74s -> 2406.07s]  by the way.
[2406.07s -> 2408.07s]  I do that more often than not.
[2408.07s -> 2414.15s]  Alright, let's go. I want to kill
[2414.15s -> 2416.15s]  at least ten people in a row.
[2416.15s -> 2421.13s]  Doctor.
[2421.13s -> 2423.86s]  No!
[2423.86s -> 2426.10s]  I saved him.
[2426.10s -> 2434.23s]  Oh my god, more spies!
[2434.23s -> 2436.23s]  Oh, that's crit, someone's going to walk over that.
[2436.23s -> 2439.30s]  Someone's going to walk over that.
[2439.30s -> 2441.30s]  I don't feel bad for them.
[2441.30s -> 2443.48s]  Oh, this is not good.
[2443.48s -> 2446.55s]  I forgot I had this equipped.
[2446.55s -> 2448.55s]  It's fine, that's fine. Oh, great.
[2448.55s -> 2451.50s]  Come on, somebody walk over here.
[2451.50s -> 2454.30s]  Somebody touch that cart.
[2454.30s -> 2460.76s]  There he is. Oh, I thought I was going to blow somebody up.
[2460.76s -> 2462.76s]  Let's see, let's see if I can't ambush
[2462.76s -> 2468.26s]  somebody. Come on,
[2468.26s -> 2470.26s]  you coming? Oh, okay, okay, we got a medic, we got a medic,
[2470.26s -> 2472.57s]  we got a medic. Coming out this way,
[2472.57s -> 2475.51s]  buddy, where you going?
[2475.51s -> 2477.51s]  I think I'm running into a spy.
[2477.51s -> 2480.14s]  Alright, alright, alright.
[2480.14s -> 2482.14s]  Stalk the prey, just like you would
[2482.14s -> 2484.50s]  in the jungle.
[2486.50s -> 2488.50s]  Random crit, random crit.
[2488.50s -> 2490.50s]  Random crit! Yes!
[2490.50s -> 2492.50s]  Yes! Oh,
[2492.50s -> 2494.50s]  I can't believe it.
[2494.50s -> 2498.22s]  Oh, let's be a real jerk.
[2498.22s -> 2505.45s]  Oh, I'm being a real
[2505.45s -> 2507.45s]  bad person right now, I'm out of here.
[2507.45s -> 2514.41s]  Oh, get that
[2514.41s -> 2516.41s]  spy! I keep pulling this
[2516.41s -> 2521.02s]  stupid thing out. I'm going to be
[2521.02s -> 2523.02s]  playing Diablo 3 in like
[2523.02s -> 2525.02s]  15 minutes or so.
[2525.02s -> 2529.30s]  Here we go, same guy, same guy.
[2529.30s -> 2532.12s]  Round 2? Round 2.
[2532.12s -> 2535.90s]  Come on. Oh, round
[2535.90s -> 2537.90s]  2. Round 2.
[2537.90s -> 2541.54s]  I got him. Oh,
[2541.54s -> 2543.54s]  now I'm a lot sober.
[2543.54s -> 2549.56s]  That pyro has to be very, very upset
[2549.56s -> 2554.17s]  with me. You got to imagine
[2554.17s -> 2556.17s]  that that pyro is probably not happy right
[2556.17s -> 2564.02s]  now. Well,
[2564.02s -> 2573.18s]  I would be quite upset as well.
[2573.18s -> 2575.18s]  Oh, I'm hitting into the stupid thing.
[2575.18s -> 2578.31s]  One heavy down.
[2578.31s -> 2582.86s]  Come on, somebody get on that. Cut!
[2582.86s -> 2587.66s]  I need some health.
[2587.66s -> 2591.50s]  I need some health, man. Help me!
[2591.50s -> 2593.50s]  Please help me.
[2593.50s -> 2599.64s]  Thank you.
[2599.64s -> 2606.42s]  Oh, come on. I got it.
[2606.42s -> 2611.93s]  Spencer down. Come on,
[2611.93s -> 2614.87s]  walk out that front door.
[2614.87s -> 2616.87s]  Oh, come on. Walk right into a crit
[2616.87s -> 2622.04s]  rocket. Crap. Damn it.
[2622.04s -> 2624.04s]  God dang.
[2624.04s -> 2628.65s]  That pyro is your friend?
[2628.65s -> 2633.58s]  Oh my god.
[2633.58s -> 2638.70s]  I'm going demo night. 7 and 3?
[2638.70s -> 2640.70s]  What'd I say? 1 of 10 kills?
[2640.70s -> 2643.06s]  Alright, I'll get it all right now. Here's 1.
[2643.06s -> 2648.89s]  No, that's no spy.
[2648.89s -> 2650.89s]  They're getting locked in the spawn, man. I feel bad
[2650.89s -> 2655.37s]  for these guys. Hey, spy.
[2655.37s -> 2657.37s]  I just ran into you. Don't know where you are, but it's okay.
[2657.37s -> 2660.89s]  Oh, there he is.
[2660.89s -> 2663.32s]  Prey number 1.
[2663.32s -> 2673.10s]  Yikes.
[2673.10s -> 2675.10s]  Oh, how did they know? How did they know?
[2675.10s -> 2678.74s]  Did you win that duel,
[2678.74s -> 2680.74s]  Justin? I don't even remember.
[2680.74s -> 2683.94s]  You probably did.
[2685.94s -> 2689.27s]  Medic, medic, medic.
[2689.27s -> 2695.80s]  All you have now
[2695.80s -> 2697.80s]  is that crit's cast hat.
[2697.80s -> 2700.74s]  Uh, no, I have other
[2700.74s -> 2702.74s]  hats. I just recently got it, so I haven't put it...
[2702.74s -> 2704.74s]  Oh, this is it, by the way, if you want to see it.
[2704.74s -> 2706.98s]  Vintage lo-fi
[2706.98s -> 2710.06s]  longwave. I just have it on
[2710.06s -> 2712.06s]  all my classes right now, just
[2712.06s -> 2714.06s]  for fun, because I just got it recently.
[2714.06s -> 2716.23s]  And it can be equipped on anybody, so...
[2716.23s -> 2718.73s]  Oh,
[2718.73s -> 2720.73s]  no.
[2720.73s -> 2723.61s]  I totally did not time
[2723.61s -> 2726.49s]  that right. Totally didn't time that
[2726.49s -> 2730.71s]  right.
[2730.71s -> 2735.70s]  HalBlobberFatty, what's up, man?
[2735.70s -> 2740.12s]  I play Diablo 3 with
[2740.12s -> 2742.12s]  Star, Shibby, MLC Stealth, and
[2742.12s -> 2745.32s]  Burger Boy. Alright, let's start
[2745.32s -> 2747.32s]  the chain here. Let's start the chain here.
[2747.32s -> 2751.16s]  This guy's gonna kill me.
[2751.16s -> 2753.59s]  I have no health at all.
[2753.59s -> 2757.24s]  Come on, stay alive until I get charged!
[2757.24s -> 2759.24s]  Yes.
[2759.24s -> 2761.24s]  Alright, let's do it.
[2761.24s -> 2765.38s]  Let's go for this.
[2767.38s -> 2769.38s]  Somebody, like, walk up here.
[2769.38s -> 2771.38s]  Oh, crap.
[2771.38s -> 2775.61s]  Suicide
[2775.61s -> 2777.78s]  for the win.
[2777.78s -> 2779.78s]  Alright, one more kill, and I'm gonna
[2779.78s -> 2781.78s]  probably move on to Diablo 3.
[2781.78s -> 2784.79s]  Let's all ask him
[2784.79s -> 2787.03s]  if he's a Brony.
[2787.03s -> 2789.85s]  I...
[2789.85s -> 2791.85s]  I...
[2791.85s -> 2794.79s]  I don't think so, no.
[2794.79s -> 2796.79s]  That's somebody that really likes watching that
[2796.79s -> 2798.79s]  show, right? That My Little Pony show.
[2798.79s -> 2800.79s]  I've never watched one episode, I've never
[2800.79s -> 2803.86s]  seen one episode.
[2803.86s -> 2805.86s]  I don't really watch any TV. The only TV
[2805.86s -> 2807.86s]  I really watch is... I mean, I
[2807.86s -> 2809.86s]  watch a lot of YouTube, if you count that.
[2809.86s -> 2813.64s]  I can't believe I missed. Thank God
[2813.64s -> 2815.64s]  El Scorcho just sniped him, because that was
[2815.64s -> 2820.89s]  awful.
[2820.89s -> 2827.59s]  Ah.
[2827.59s -> 2829.59s]  I'm sorry, did you just say suicide for the win?
[2829.59s -> 2831.59s]  Fake in-game
[2831.59s -> 2833.59s]  suicide for the win. We'll put it that way.
[2839.78s -> 2841.78s]  I got the kill, though. That's what I wanted.
[2841.78s -> 2846.14s]  Never seen one of my streams? Well, welcome.
[2846.14s -> 2849.08s]  Thanks for coming, man.
[2849.08s -> 2851.83s]  Oh, super trick!
[2851.83s -> 2853.83s]  Alright, let me see...
[2853.83s -> 2856.58s]  Is anybody even online?
[2856.58s -> 2858.58s]  Do I have to play some Diablo 3?
[2858.58s -> 2861.53s]  I'm not even in Skype.
[2861.53s -> 2865.82s]  Let's see if anyone's
[2865.82s -> 2869.91s]  online.
[2869.91s -> 2873.56s]  Burger Boy is online.
[2873.56s -> 2876.57s]  No sign of Brett with Shibby.
[2876.57s -> 2879.26s]  Shibby is online.
[2879.26s -> 2881.26s]  And Star is online, too.
[2881.26s -> 2885.22s]  Alright, we can make something happen here.
[2885.22s -> 2887.66s]  Oh, not a new game. Yeah!
[2887.66s -> 2889.66s]  So, I have to get Diablo 3 in a window.
[2889.66s -> 2891.66s]  So, if you came here for the TF2,
[2891.66s -> 2893.66s]  thanks for coming.
[2893.66s -> 2895.66s]  Glad you stopped by.
[2895.66s -> 2898.15s]  And yeah, thank you.
[2898.15s -> 2900.15s]  If you want to stick around for Diablo 3, I'm going to be streaming Diablo 3 for
[2900.15s -> 2902.33s]  probably
[2902.33s -> 2904.33s]  quite a long time. And when I say quite a long time,
[2904.33s -> 2906.33s]  I mean at least an hour or two.
[2906.33s -> 2908.74s]  So, yeah.
[2908.74s -> 2912.52s]  Let me get that rolling here.
[2912.52s -> 2918.66s]  First, let me write a heart.
[2920.66s -> 2922.66s]  The screen is going to go black
[2922.66s -> 2924.66s]  for a minute
[2924.66s -> 2927.22s]  or so here.
[2927.22s -> 2929.22s]  Whoa! Streamception.
[2929.22s -> 2931.66s]  The screen is going to go black. But I'm still here.
[2931.66s -> 2934.66s]  Don't worry.
[2934.66s -> 2937.80s]  I have not left. I'm still kicking.
[2937.80s -> 2941.90s]  So, what can I talk about while I do this?
[2941.90s -> 2944.52s]  Oh, Diablo 3.
[2944.52s -> 2948.62s]  Because I'm going to play Diablo 3 right now.
[2948.62s -> 2950.62s]  Loading up Diablo 3.
[2950.62s -> 2954.84s]  So, what I can talk about while this is
[2954.84s -> 2956.84s]  kind of a black screen right now is
[2956.84s -> 2958.84s]  yes, I'm still a barbarian.
[2958.84s -> 2960.84s]  I'm having fun with this new build, and I'll try and talk about it.
[2960.84s -> 2962.84s]  What I'm doing is
[2962.84s -> 2964.84s]  I've got to show it on the screen before
[2964.84s -> 2968.55s]  any of that
[2968.55s -> 2970.55s]  good stuff happens.
[2970.55s -> 2972.55s]  So, hold on a second, guys.
[2972.55s -> 2974.55s]  It's probably going to be a whole lot of
[2974.55s -> 2978.33s]  nonsense in the background.
[2980.33s -> 2982.33s]  Windowed.
[2982.33s -> 2986.42s]  80 by 720.
[2986.42s -> 2989.18s]  Why can't I make it to window?
[2989.18s -> 2994.74s]  Well, that's weird.
[2994.74s -> 3003.26s]  Why can't I change it to...
[3003.26s -> 3007.10s]  What's the deal? There we go.
[3007.10s -> 3009.10s]  All right. Windowed. There's the window.
[3009.10s -> 3011.40s]  I believe that's
[3011.40s -> 3018.63s]  correct.
[3018.63s -> 3027.26s]  There we go.
[3027.26s -> 3029.26s]  Okay. I'm coming back.
[3029.26s -> 3036.87s]  Coming back. Coming back.
[3036.87s -> 3043.64s]  Are we back?
[3043.64s -> 3046.65s]  No, that's not quite what I wanted.
[3046.65s -> 3048.65s]  Not quite. Hold on, guys. Sorry about this.
[3048.65s -> 3054.66s]  Not quite what I was
[3054.66s -> 3059.32s]  looking for, but it's okay.
[3059.32s -> 3061.32s]  All right. Okay. Now I've got to do this.
[3061.32s -> 3064.33s]  Hello.
[3064.33s -> 3068.09s]  Ah!
[3068.09s -> 3070.09s]  Inception. Inception.
[3070.09s -> 3076.42s]  Inception.
[3076.42s -> 3082.25s]  Hold on. I'm going to try one more thing here.
[3082.25s -> 3084.87s]  Just black bars on the side.
[3084.87s -> 3088.26s]  I don't want that.
[3088.26s -> 3094.73s]  I don't want that at all.
[3094.73s -> 3101.58s]  Now let's try this again.
[3101.58s -> 3103.58s]  Okay. I got it this time.
[3103.58s -> 3111.58s]  I got it this time.
[3111.58s -> 3118.81s]  Add screen region. Screen region.
[3118.81s -> 3138.44s]  Hello.
[3138.44s -> 3142.34s]  And let's do it.
[3142.34s -> 3147.53s]  Okay. We're back.
[3147.53s -> 3150.60s]  I'm actually going to turn some of these down.
[3150.60s -> 3152.60s]  The purposes of...
[3152.60s -> 3156.25s]  The purposes of streaming.
[3156.25s -> 3163.80s]  And there we go.
[3163.80s -> 3165.80s]  Watch if you like servers are down.
[3165.80s -> 3169.90s]  So now I want to show you guys my...
[3169.90s -> 3171.90s]  This is my barbarian.
[3171.90s -> 3177.59s]  Look at him. He's like, cool.
[3177.59s -> 3179.59s]  Oh, Burger Boy is in the game right now.
[3179.59s -> 3184.26s]  I'll go play with Burger Boy.
[3184.26s -> 3186.26s]  He's in Act 1.
[3186.26s -> 3188.26s]  Oh, so I've got to say this is going to have...
[3188.26s -> 3190.76s]  Actually, this is not going to have any spoilers.
[3190.76s -> 3194.22s]  Let's go join him.
[3194.22s -> 3197.22s]  He's going to be so confused.
[3197.22s -> 3208.42s]  He's going to be like, what are you doing in here?
[3208.42s -> 3210.42s]  I just said, sup, Burger. I'm streaming.
[3210.42s -> 3215.61s]  Where is he right now?
[3215.61s -> 3217.61s]  So this is what I wanted to show you my build.
[3217.61s -> 3222.54s]  This is the build I'm working on right now for the barbarian.
[3225.03s -> 3227.03s]  So I have right now...
[3227.03s -> 3229.03s]  See this thing right here?
[3229.03s -> 3231.03s]  Berserker Rage.
[3231.03s -> 3233.03s]  You inflict an additional 25% damage while at maximum fury.
[3233.03s -> 3235.03s]  So what I'm trying to do is
[3235.03s -> 3237.03s]  I'm trying to use as many moves as I can
[3237.03s -> 3239.03s]  that are not
[3239.03s -> 3241.03s]  consumers of fury.
[3241.03s -> 3243.03s]  Because obviously these ones are not.
[3243.03s -> 3245.03s]  As a barbarian, if you don't know,
[3245.03s -> 3247.03s]  you have moves that build fury.
[3247.03s -> 3249.03s]  And you have moves that
[3249.03s -> 3251.03s]  use it, remove it.
[3251.03s -> 3253.03s]  So what I'm trying to do is
[3253.03s -> 3255.03s]  I'm trying to do this kind of build where
[3255.03s -> 3257.03s]  I'm always at maximum fury, at least for the most part.
[3257.03s -> 3259.03s]  So I get 25% damage from that
[3259.03s -> 3261.03s]  just by having the fury
[3261.03s -> 3263.03s]  as high as it can go.
[3263.03s -> 3265.03s]  And then this,
[3265.03s -> 3267.03s]  Enter a Rage, which increases damage done by 15%
[3267.03s -> 3269.03s]  and critical hit chance by 3%
[3269.03s -> 3271.03s]  for 30 seconds. So it's a buff, right?
[3271.03s -> 3273.03s]  And of course I have this rune
[3273.03s -> 3275.21s]  where it makes it so
[3275.21s -> 3277.21s]  it increases that damage bonus to 30%.
[3277.21s -> 3279.38s]  So, if you can do the math,
[3279.38s -> 3281.38s]  what I'm trying to do is have this be at 30%
[3281.38s -> 3283.38s]  and have this be full all the time
[3283.38s -> 3285.38s]  so it's at 25%.
[3285.38s -> 3287.38s]  So you're talking
[3287.38s -> 3289.38s]  55% more damage if I have
[3289.38s -> 3291.38s]  full fury. And I'm trying to stay there
[3291.38s -> 3296.57s]  as much as I can.
[3296.57s -> 3298.57s]  So let's go
[3298.57s -> 3302.02s]  find Burger Boy. Burger Boy!
[3302.02s -> 3304.33s]  Actually I want to turn up
[3304.33s -> 3306.95s]  I'll just join off him.
[3306.95s -> 3309.32s]  I'm not sure where he is right now.
[3309.32s -> 3313.74s]  I think he's in the Old Ruins.
[3313.74s -> 3315.98s]  Barbarian, someone's asking?
[3315.98s -> 3317.98s]  Oh god, lag.
[3317.98s -> 3319.98s]  Why Barbarian? Because Barbarian,
[3319.98s -> 3321.98s]  I don't know, I remember the Barbarian from
[3321.98s -> 3324.15s]  Diablo 2.
[3324.15s -> 3327.03s]  Let me turn the sound down a little bit.
[3327.03s -> 3329.03s]  The Barbarian in Diablo 2 is just a classic.
[3329.03s -> 3331.03s]  And I'm a huge fan of the classic
[3331.03s -> 3334.23s]  Diablo. So of course
[3334.23s -> 3336.23s]  I'm going to try and pick it and play.
[3336.23s -> 3338.98s]  This is on Nightmare by the way.
[3338.98s -> 3340.98s]  We have already completed this game at least once.
[3340.98s -> 3342.98s]  And it's probably going to lag for the first
[3342.98s -> 3344.98s]  few seconds or minutes
[3344.98s -> 3346.98s]  or so of the game.
[3346.98s -> 3348.98s]  Only because
[3348.98s -> 3350.98s]  it does that for some reason. I don't know why.
[3350.98s -> 3352.98s]  Diablo 3 is very, very buggy right now.
[3352.98s -> 3357.59s]  What quest are you on
[3357.59s -> 3361.24s]  right now?
[3361.24s -> 3363.24s]  I'm going to show you what I'm talking about though.
[3363.24s -> 3365.24s]  So I have Frenzy, right?
[3365.24s -> 3367.24s]  Frenzy speeds up the more I hit people.
[3367.24s -> 3369.24s]  Like speeds up my attack speed.
[3369.24s -> 3371.24s]  So what I'm trying to do is just be like an absolute
[3371.24s -> 3373.24s]  psycho and swing like 100 miles per hour.
[3373.24s -> 3375.24s]  See if I can't show what I'm talking about here.
[3375.24s -> 3377.24s]  So see, the more I hit people
[3377.24s -> 3379.24s]  the faster I'm going to swing.
[3379.24s -> 3381.24s]  And those yellow letters, those are crits.
[3381.24s -> 3386.68s]  Yeah, let me get Burger Boy in the Skype call.
[3386.68s -> 3389.50s]  Burger Boy, I'm going to
[3389.50s -> 3393.02s]  call you. Where are you, Burger?
[3393.02s -> 3397.05s]  Actually Burger Boy,
[3397.05s -> 3399.05s]  can you call me?
[3399.05s -> 3401.05s]  Just call me Burger Boy.
[3401.05s -> 3403.05s]  Because I'm a bit used to much of my bandwidth.
[3403.05s -> 3408.55s]  Oh, he just started Act 1
[3408.55s -> 3410.55s]  Nightmare. So for those of you
[3410.55s -> 3412.55s]  watching, this is the very beginning of Act 1.
[3412.55s -> 3414.55s]  And it's on Nightmare difficulty.
[3414.55s -> 3419.03s]  You just started Burger Boy.
[3419.03s -> 3424.98s]  Where are you, Burger?
[3424.98s -> 3430.42s]  That's where I am.
[3430.42s -> 3434.46s]  I'm trying to remember what quest he's even on.
[3434.46s -> 3436.95s]  Oh, Burger Boy has to come in here.
[3436.95s -> 3438.95s]  Because he has the quest person.
[3438.95s -> 3441.96s]  So you want to see my stuff?
[3441.96s -> 3443.96s]  Before we get going here?
[3443.96s -> 3445.96s]  Before Burger Boy gives me a ring-a-ding-ding.
[3445.96s -> 3453.58s]  Burger. Look at that face,
[3453.58s -> 3455.58s]  by the way. Look at like Burger Boy's
[3455.58s -> 3459.29s]  face. Someone's asking
[3459.29s -> 3461.29s]  what is Diablo 3 about?
[3461.29s -> 3463.29s]  It's kind of a difficult thing to explain,
[3463.29s -> 3465.29s]  but pretty much it's an action RPG
[3465.29s -> 3467.29s]  where you run around and you kill
[3467.29s -> 3469.29s]  literally hundreds and hundreds
[3469.29s -> 3471.29s]  of monsters at the same time.
[3471.29s -> 3473.29s]  And hold on, Burger Boy is actually calling.
[3473.29s -> 3476.62s]  What's up, Burger?
[3476.62s -> 3481.22s]  Oh, hold on, I gotta change something.
[3481.22s -> 3483.22s]  You know you guys can't hear, am I gonna make it so he's coming through the right
[3483.22s -> 3486.17s]  line? Line 1.
[3486.17s -> 3490.89s]  There we go. Burger Boy, close
[3490.89s -> 3492.89s]  your windows.
[3492.89s -> 3494.89s]  Oh yeah. Sorry. Hold on.
[3494.89s -> 3497.51s]  Burger Boy like lives like on a
[3497.51s -> 3499.51s]  highway.
[3499.51s -> 3505.59s]  Alright, let's do this
[3505.59s -> 3508.02s]  thing, man. Bring a
[3508.02s -> 3510.02s]  Leia. Oh, she's actually right here.
[3510.02s -> 3512.65s]  You want me to grab
[3512.65s -> 3514.65s]  my 42 and you want to continue
[3514.65s -> 3516.65s]  where we left off?
[3516.65s -> 3518.65s]  No, it's alright. It doesn't matter. We gotta catch up
[3518.65s -> 3520.65s]  a little bit anyways, cause Shibby and
[3520.65s -> 3522.65s]  all them, Breton, they're all
[3522.65s -> 3525.98s]  a little higher. It's a beautiful
[3525.98s -> 3527.98s]  face, somebody said, about your face.
[3527.98s -> 3531.48s]  Oh, sweet.
[3531.48s -> 3533.48s]  But somebody was asking what this game's about.
[3533.48s -> 3535.48s]  Pretty much loot. It's about picking up
[3535.48s -> 3537.48s]  stuff. It's about
[3537.48s -> 3539.48s]  collecting gear.
[3539.48s -> 3541.48s]  And I'll show you my character. This is my
[3541.48s -> 3544.36s]  character's stuff. It's about
[3544.36s -> 3546.36s]  collecting gems and rares and uniques
[3546.36s -> 3548.36s]  and there's literally thousands and thousands
[3548.36s -> 3550.36s]  and thousands of different items in the game.
[3550.36s -> 3552.79s]  And right now we're in the middle of
[3552.79s -> 3554.79s]  the Act 1 quest where we're supposed to be killing,
[3554.79s -> 3556.79s]  I think we're supposed to be finding somebody actually.
[3556.79s -> 3558.79s]  So let's start whooping butt.
[3558.79s -> 3564.30s]  So Burger Boy, I'm a barbarian.
[3564.30s -> 3566.30s]  Burger Boy is a monk.
[3566.30s -> 3568.30s]  Oh god, freeze.
[3568.30s -> 3572.58s]  Yeah, killing stuff. That's pretty much what
[3572.58s -> 3574.58s]  it is, killing stuff. Killing
[3574.58s -> 3576.58s]  bosses, trying to get better gear, trying to have...
[3576.58s -> 3578.58s]  For you TF2 guys, I'll
[3578.58s -> 3580.58s]  explain it like this. So you
[3580.58s -> 3582.58s]  have unusual hats in
[3582.58s -> 3585.34s]  Team Fortress, right? So unusual
[3585.34s -> 3587.70s]  hats, pretty much think of it,
[3587.70s -> 3589.70s]  every time we kill a boss in this game,
[3589.70s -> 3591.70s]  or any time you kill a major enemy or
[3591.70s -> 3593.70s]  a very rare enemy, it's like opening
[3593.70s -> 3597.16s]  a crate. It's like opening
[3597.16s -> 3599.16s]  a Team Fortress crate. And there's
[3599.16s -> 3601.16s]  items that are really, really incredible
[3601.16s -> 3603.16s]  they're called Legendary.
[3603.16s -> 3605.16s]  And the chance of getting one of those is like
[3605.16s -> 3607.16s]  probably 1-2% per
[3607.16s -> 3609.16s]  major enemy you kill.
[3609.16s -> 3611.16s]  So it's a very
[3611.16s -> 3613.16s]  big like treasure box game where you want to get
[3613.16s -> 3615.16s]  like as many cool pieces of gear, you want to get all the awesome stuff.
[3615.16s -> 3617.16s]  That's the best way
[3617.16s -> 3619.16s]  to describe this game. It's all about making your character
[3619.16s -> 3623.58s]  better. And I'm level
[3623.58s -> 3625.82s]  32. I'm 42.
[3625.82s -> 3627.82s]  I should probably not even be here with you. I'm probably not going to get
[3627.82s -> 3629.82s]  rid of that much experience. Yeah, I'll roll on my 42.
[3629.82s -> 3631.82s]  That's fine, staying game. Okay.
[3631.82s -> 3636.55s]  It's just very addicting.
[3636.55s -> 3640.39s]  Everything about it is addicting.
[3640.39s -> 3642.39s]  There's an auction house. You can sell stuff. You can...
[3642.39s -> 3644.39s]  There's a whole trading atmosphere to it.
[3644.39s -> 3649.96s]  It's very, very interesting.
[3649.96s -> 3651.96s]  But I've been waiting for this game for over 10 years.
[3651.96s -> 3654.14s]  Just about 10 years.
[3654.14s -> 3656.14s]  2,000...1999?
[3656.14s -> 3659.59s]  Yeah, exactly, Shaxx. Exactly.
[3659.59s -> 3661.59s]  It is unboxing a boss.
[3661.59s -> 3663.59s]  And even just
[3663.59s -> 3665.59s]  regular enemies too. If you notice when I kill some of
[3665.59s -> 3667.59s]  these guys, they'll just drop stuff.
[3667.59s -> 3669.59s]  They randomly will drop stuff on the ground.
[3669.59s -> 3674.78s]  And there's a big storyline to it.
[3674.78s -> 3676.78s]  There's a whole lot of cool stuff to read about.
[3676.78s -> 3679.02s]  Just interesting.
[3679.02s -> 3687.26s]  Excuse me.
[3687.26s -> 3689.26s]  Oh, the Puke spell. Puke spell.
[3689.26s -> 3698.14s]  I'll give you guys this buff.
[3698.14s -> 3702.30s]  That's still recharging.
[3702.30s -> 3704.30s]  But if you are a fan of action RPGs,
[3704.30s -> 3706.30s]  this is pretty much the series that started
[3706.30s -> 3708.66s]  it all. Diablo 1.
[3708.66s -> 3713.27s]  I'm not going to
[3713.27s -> 3715.27s]  give up my battle tag.
[3715.27s -> 3717.27s]  For the main purposes of...
[3717.27s -> 3719.27s]  It's very easy just to join off of
[3719.27s -> 3721.27s]  anybody's game. So I'm going to
[3721.27s -> 3723.27s]  keep that probably private for now.
[3723.27s -> 3726.79s]  Because as you know, if
[3726.79s -> 3729.42s]  anybody joins your game,
[3729.42s -> 3731.42s]  the game just gets harder.
[3731.42s -> 3733.42s]  I gotta get a water. Hold on.
[3733.42s -> 3737.82s]  I'm starting to get froggy.
[3737.82s -> 3739.82s]  But if anybody joins your game,
[3739.82s -> 3742.50s]  the game just gets harder. Everything just
[3742.50s -> 3745.83s]  gets harder. Oh, this is where it gets nuts.
[3745.83s -> 3748.78s]  Going to Super Saiyan mode.
[3748.78s -> 3752.55s]  See, I can turn into this
[3752.55s -> 3756.07s]  giant barbarian. Smash.
[3756.07s -> 3758.89s]  Get smashed.
[3758.89s -> 3763.35s]  Enemy drop.
[3763.35s -> 3765.85s]  And you get bonus experience.
[3765.85s -> 3767.85s]  You get bonus experience
[3767.85s -> 3769.85s]  for killing a certain amount
[3769.85s -> 3771.85s]  of enemies in a row. It's very, very addicting.
[3771.85s -> 3776.97s]  Everything about this game is addicting.
[3776.97s -> 3779.14s]  I'm going to go this way. Just split up so we can
[3779.14s -> 3786.95s]  fight it easier, I guess.
[3786.95s -> 3790.47s]  I got 144
[3790.47s -> 3792.47s]  killstreak earlier. It was
[3792.47s -> 3794.47s]  insane. Oh my god.
[3794.47s -> 3797.22s]  144?
[3797.22s -> 3799.22s]  Yeah, the monk's nasty.
[3799.22s -> 3801.22s]  Oh, I gotta turn you up a little bit.
[3801.22s -> 3807.24s]  There you go. People are probably having trouble
[3807.24s -> 3810.12s]  hearing you now. They can hear you probably.
[3810.12s -> 3812.12s]  Can you guys hear Burger Boy okay? Or should I lower him?
[3812.12s -> 3816.92s]  Drop him? Oh, here we go.
[3816.92s -> 3818.92s]  This is what I'm talking about. This is a room. This is like a
[3818.92s -> 3820.92s]  room full of enemies I want to fight. Bang.
[3820.92s -> 3822.92s]  I'm at the
[3822.92s -> 3825.10s]  point where we need to be.
[3825.10s -> 3827.10s]  Just... I'll TP off you in a second.
[3827.10s -> 3830.94s]  Yeah. Yeah, I will.
[3830.94s -> 3832.94s]  This will all be
[3832.94s -> 3834.94s]  uploaded to YouTube.
[3834.94s -> 3838.58s]  Tomorrow, probably afternoon.
[3838.58s -> 3840.58s]  Yeah, you can just take it. I'll just accept off you.
[3840.58s -> 3842.58s]  So, just skip everything.
[3842.58s -> 3844.58s]  Because I don't want to, you know, the story.
[3844.58s -> 3846.58s]  People might not want to see it. Yep.
[3846.58s -> 3852.07s]  And skip!
[3852.07s -> 3854.07s]  Get him, minions.
[3854.07s -> 3859.64s]  Deckard Cain.
[3859.64s -> 3863.35s]  It's Deckard Cain. This is on Nightmare, right?
[3863.35s -> 3865.35s]  Yep. Yep.
[3865.35s -> 3867.66s]  I think it is. Yeah, it is.
[3867.66s -> 3869.66s]  We got a big boy right here. What's he going to drop?
[3869.66s -> 3873.94s]  Legendary. He just keeps
[3873.94s -> 3876.31s]  dropping, like, vintage items.
[3876.31s -> 3881.43s]  Skip, skip, skip, skip.
[3881.43s -> 3883.43s]  How much is the game? The game is
[3883.43s -> 3886.12s]  60 bucks. It is
[3886.12s -> 3888.12s]  60 dollars. It's a brand new AAA release.
[3888.12s -> 3891.19s]  Kind of expensive, but
[3891.19s -> 3893.19s]  for the amount of time that we've been
[3893.19s -> 3896.33s]  playing this for...
[3896.33s -> 3898.33s]  Skip. Yeah, skip it.
[3898.33s -> 3900.33s]  For the amount of time we've been playing this for, like, I'll just show you.
[3900.33s -> 3908.97s]  I think I can show you.
[3908.97s -> 3910.97s]  I guess I can't. But I've been playing this game
[3910.97s -> 3912.97s]  on this character for probably 25, 30 hours already.
[3912.97s -> 3918.41s]  I'm almost level 43, too.
[3918.41s -> 3921.74s]  This is good stuff.
[3921.74s -> 3927.37s]  Alright, get the next quest.
[3927.37s -> 3929.37s]  Yeah, Burgerboy, he just changed classes.
[3929.37s -> 3931.37s]  He's a witch doctor now. He was on
[3931.37s -> 3933.37s]  his monk, but now he's playing as the witch doctor.
[3933.37s -> 3936.50s]  Let me sell some of this stuff.
[3936.50s -> 3939.38s]  And as you can see, he's
[3939.38s -> 3941.38s]  like 37.7 DPS, and the thing I have
[3941.38s -> 3943.38s]  on is 75.6.
[3943.38s -> 3945.38s]  And you can look at the stats, too, and you kind of go
[3945.38s -> 3947.38s]  stat crazy, and you get all nuts.
[3947.38s -> 3949.82s]  It's a lot of fun.
[3949.82s -> 3952.31s]  I don't need any of this stuff, really, though.
[3952.31s -> 3955.77s]  And I want money.
[3955.77s -> 3958.97s]  So I'm just going to sell it.
[3958.97s -> 3963.26s]  I want dat money.
[3963.26s -> 3965.26s]  Oh, no, it is not monthly. It is not
[3965.26s -> 3967.62s]  monthly. You just buy it once,
[3967.62s -> 3969.62s]  and you have it forever. You don't have to ever pay anything ever again.
[3969.62s -> 3971.62s]  Yeah, that's the best part about this game.
[3971.62s -> 3973.62s]  It was monthly, man.
[3973.62s -> 3975.62s]  I hate that,
[3975.62s -> 3977.62s]  monthly stuff.
[3977.62s -> 3979.62s]  No, I wouldn't do it if it was monthly.
[3979.62s -> 3981.62s]  Maybe for like a month or so, maybe, I don't know.
[3981.62s -> 3983.62s]  It would be tough, because the game is really fun.
[3983.62s -> 3988.30s]  Oktoberfest!
[3988.30s -> 3993.86s]  But it can get really crazy.
[3993.86s -> 3995.86s]  When you get a group of four people,
[3995.86s -> 3997.86s]  because the maximum amount of people you can have in a
[3997.86s -> 3999.86s]  lobby is four,
[3999.86s -> 4001.86s]  you get four people in this game, and it gets pretty
[4001.86s -> 4005.58s]  ridiculous.
[4005.58s -> 4007.58s]  Do we have to kill this lady, or no?
[4007.58s -> 4011.42s]  Yeah, we gotta kill this lady.
[4011.42s -> 4013.85s]  Get her. Super Saiyan mode.
[4013.85s -> 4015.85s]  Oh, she went down.
[4015.85s -> 4019.42s]  I'll just grow up all over.
[4019.42s -> 4024.47s]  Nothing good.
[4024.47s -> 4032.52s]  Nothing good.
[4032.52s -> 4034.89s]  The major points of the quest is to
[4034.89s -> 4036.89s]  make the story keep going,
[4036.89s -> 4038.89s]  progress the story, get some more gold, get some more loot.
[4038.89s -> 4041.13s]  But the real
[4041.13s -> 4044.14s]  treasure chest is the bosses.
[4044.14s -> 4046.14s]  There's like
[4046.14s -> 4048.14s]  15 major bosses in this game, maybe a little bit more.
[4048.14s -> 4053.96s]  That's like the real joy
[4053.96s -> 4055.96s]  of this game.
[4055.96s -> 4057.96s]  It's killing a boss and crossing your fingers that you're going to get a legendary.
[4057.96s -> 4059.96s]  Or like a good rare or something.
[4059.96s -> 4066.87s]  Somebody wrote,
[4066.87s -> 4068.87s]  doesn't Burger Boy only buy games
[4068.87s -> 4070.87s]  when they're $10
[4070.87s -> 4072.87s]  when they're $10?
[4072.87s -> 4074.87s]  Wow, that says a lot about this game.
[4074.87s -> 4078.01s]  Yeah, that is true.
[4078.01s -> 4084.98s]  Watch out, we got some dudes over here.
[4090.30s -> 4100.79s]  Oh, we got a lot of people over here.
[4100.79s -> 4102.79s]  Oh, God.
[4102.79s -> 4105.93s]  Let's just smash them.
[4105.93s -> 4108.94s]  Smash them.
[4108.94s -> 4110.94s]  I love that move so much. Cleave is so much fun.
[4110.94s -> 4112.94s]  You can just swipe at everybody
[4112.94s -> 4114.94s]  and just crush them.
[4114.94s -> 4119.16s]  Yep, bosses are treasure boxes.
[4119.16s -> 4121.16s]  When you kill a boss,
[4121.16s -> 4123.16s]  a ton of stuff just jumps out
[4123.16s -> 4125.16s]  into the screen.
[4125.16s -> 4127.16s]  And you see what you want to pick up,
[4127.16s -> 4129.16s]  what you don't want to pick up, what you want to trade to people,
[4129.16s -> 4134.86s]  what you want to sell.
[4134.86s -> 4136.86s]  We'll be at one of those bosses
[4136.86s -> 4138.86s]  probably in the next 25 minutes or so.
[4138.86s -> 4141.42s]  The Skeleton King.
[4141.42s -> 4157.34s]  This way.
[4157.34s -> 4167.94s]  Burger Boy. Get out of town.
[4167.94s -> 4174.47s]  Pick up all the money is important.
[4174.47s -> 4176.47s]  Waypoint.
[4176.47s -> 4185.29s]  You found the waypoint, nice.
[4185.29s -> 4191.82s]  Is there a way?
[4191.82s -> 4193.82s]  Just trying to see when people were online last.
[4193.82s -> 4197.59s]  Always check the...
[4197.59s -> 4199.59s]  Oh, I thought, oh my God.
[4199.59s -> 4201.83s]  I almost just lost my mind.
[4201.83s -> 4203.83s]  I thought my brain just collapsed right there.
[4203.83s -> 4205.83s]  I thought that was a set item or something.
[4205.83s -> 4208.01s]  You want to go down one of those doors
[4208.01s -> 4210.01s]  and I'll go down another
[4210.01s -> 4212.01s]  since we're a little ahead on the level here?
[4212.01s -> 4216.42s]  Yep. Sounds like a plan.
[4216.42s -> 4225.38s]  Get that speed.
[4225.38s -> 4231.08s]  Jerma, are you grandpa?
[4231.08s -> 4233.08s]  That mystery will never be solved.
[4233.08s -> 4238.14s]  I can neither confirm nor deny
[4238.14s -> 4240.14s]  that statement.
[4240.14s -> 4245.19s]  I'll check this one.
[4245.19s -> 4247.61s]  If you need help, just call it out.
[4247.61s -> 4249.61s]  Yeah, I'll be good. I got my minions.
[4249.61s -> 4251.61s]  That's right, you are.
[4251.61s -> 4253.61s]  You are a witch doctor.
[4253.61s -> 4260.01s]  I do forget that sometimes.
[4260.01s -> 4262.01s]  Technically Diablo 3 is not an MMO,
[4262.01s -> 4264.01s]  but I guess you could classify it as one.
[4264.01s -> 4266.01s]  With the trading and the items
[4266.01s -> 4268.01s]  and the multiplayer.
[4268.01s -> 4271.02s]  But it is at the heart
[4271.02s -> 4273.02s]  of a single player game.
[4273.02s -> 4275.02s]  For the most part.
[4275.02s -> 4278.28s]  Oh, a treasure bandit.
[4278.28s -> 4280.28s]  Oh man, I wish you were down here right now.
[4280.28s -> 4284.18s]  It's alright, I'll try and kill him.
[4284.18s -> 4286.18s]  Oh, die you little bastard.
[4286.18s -> 4288.18s]  Yes, nice.
[4288.18s -> 4291.32s]  I got to check that out.
[4291.32s -> 4293.32s]  So what I just did right there, guys,
[4293.32s -> 4295.32s]  is there was a little dude and he carries around
[4295.32s -> 4298.20s]  like a knapsack.
[4298.20s -> 4300.20s]  Burger Boy immediately
[4300.20s -> 4302.20s]  came to where the Treasure Goblin was.
[4302.20s -> 4305.40s]  And if you kill that guy, he drops
[4305.40s -> 4307.40s]  a lot of stuff, as you can see. Look at the ground.
[4307.40s -> 4310.02s]  It's covered with things.
[4310.02s -> 4312.02s]  See, these are rare.
[4314.84s -> 4316.84s]  This is like the uncreating thing I was talking about, guys.
[4316.84s -> 4318.84s]  It's not a legendary, but it's still a rare.
[4318.84s -> 4327.22s]  Let's see what it is like.
[4327.22s -> 4330.04s]  The thing I have is better.
[4330.04s -> 4332.04s]  Vitality, 3 health per second.
[4332.04s -> 4334.73s]  I can sell that, though.
[4334.73s -> 4338.31s]  I can sell it.
[4338.31s -> 4346.36s]  I'll grab some more of this stuff.
[4346.36s -> 4349.37s]  Yeah, I think there will be DLC.
[4349.37s -> 4351.37s]  Oh, got an event down here.
[4351.37s -> 4353.37s]  They already confirmed that there was going to be
[4353.37s -> 4355.37s]  at least one expansion.
[4355.37s -> 4357.37s]  Oh boy, there's a couple lords.
[4357.37s -> 4359.37s]  Lords and ladies.
[4359.37s -> 4362.25s]  Yeah, these guys got nothing.
[4362.25s -> 4364.94s]  We're a little bit high level for this.
[4364.94s -> 4366.94s]  But, I mean, it's good just to
[4366.94s -> 4376.09s]  clean through everything.
[4376.09s -> 4378.09s]  If you wanted to bring your witch, I mean, your monk in here,
[4378.09s -> 4380.09s]  when we get to the boss, you could.
[4380.09s -> 4382.09s]  Just, like, speed level him.
[4382.09s -> 4385.16s]  Hmm.
[4385.16s -> 4387.98s]  Good idea.
[4387.98s -> 4390.34s]  I'm pretty sure that's how it works.
[4390.34s -> 4392.65s]  Yeah, we'll try it.
[4392.65s -> 4394.65s]  What do you mean, when we get to the skeleton king?
[4394.65s -> 4396.65s]  Yeah, yeah.
[4396.65s -> 4398.65s]  What do you think, like, you don't have to complete
[4398.65s -> 4401.02s]  the quest before?
[4401.02s -> 4403.02s]  I don't think so.
[4403.02s -> 4405.02s]  I could be wrong, but I don't think so.
[4405.02s -> 4407.02s]  Level 43.
[4407.02s -> 4410.26s]  Ow.
[4410.26s -> 4412.26s]  A new rune.
[4412.26s -> 4415.02s]  Gotta check that.
[4415.02s -> 4420.90s]  These guys, these little bastards are running around like crazy.
[4420.90s -> 4422.90s]  I'm a melee class, I can't keep up.
[4422.90s -> 4427.32s]  Oh, damn.
[4427.32s -> 4430.46s]  Kill this guy.
[4430.46s -> 4432.46s]  Speed hack, speed hack.
[4432.46s -> 4434.46s]  I don't even need to use my cooldown.
[4434.46s -> 4437.59s]  Anything?
[4437.59s -> 4442.90s]  No.
[4442.90s -> 4444.90s]  Oh, that is good to know.
[4444.90s -> 4446.90s]  Good to know. Thanks for whoever said that.
[4446.90s -> 4450.30s]  Let me see what his name was.
[4450.30s -> 4452.47s]  Thank you for that.
[4452.47s -> 4454.47s]  This guy just said, if you hold down control while you hover over an item,
[4454.47s -> 4456.47s]  you can see the stats on it.
[4456.47s -> 4459.10s]  Oh, wow. That's awesome.
[4459.10s -> 4461.10s]  I didn't even realize that.
[4461.10s -> 4464.62s]  What an idiot both of us are.
[4464.62s -> 4466.62s]  Oh, man.
[4466.62s -> 4468.62s]  Rare shoulder plates.
[4468.62s -> 4471.69s]  Let's identify these babies.
[4471.69s -> 4474.70s]  Oh, a shibby's gonna want these.
[4474.70s -> 4476.70s]  74 intelligence.
[4476.70s -> 4478.70s]  82 vitality.
[4478.70s -> 4482.86s]  I'll hold on to those for the shibster.
[4482.86s -> 4484.86s]  Alright, so it wasn't in here.
[4484.86s -> 4490.92s]  Yeah, it wasn't that one.
[4490.92s -> 4493.42s]  It might be the one you were at.
[4493.42s -> 4500.26s]  Let me check this one.
[4500.26s -> 4508.33s]  What's my favorite type of cheese?
[4508.33s -> 4510.33s]  Swiss cheese.
[4510.33s -> 4513.72s]  If you want, we can try and do...
[4513.72s -> 4515.72s]  If you want to go to Act 2 and try and farm the boss, maybe.
[4515.72s -> 4517.90s]  Yeah, let's do it.
[4517.90s -> 4519.90s]  If you want to do that after we...
[4519.90s -> 4521.90s]  I want to go through a more little dungeon first.
[4521.90s -> 4524.52s]  Yeah, because I don't even have to complete this.
[4524.52s -> 4526.52s]  I already did this on this character.
[4526.52s -> 4529.98s]  See, the cool part about this game, guys,
[4529.98s -> 4531.98s]  is you can literally
[4531.98s -> 4534.73s]  just keep opening crates.
[4534.73s -> 4536.73s]  You just keep killing the same boss over and over again
[4536.73s -> 4538.73s]  to try and get cool stuff.
[4538.73s -> 4541.74s]  Yeah, we'll do that.
[4541.74s -> 4543.74s]  Let's do that. I'll make the game.
[4543.74s -> 4551.93s]  Alright, is that a new perk?
[4551.93s -> 4556.02s]  TF2 was before this.
[4556.02s -> 4558.02s]  If you missed it, it's gonna be uploaded tomorrow to YouTube.
[4558.02s -> 4562.70s]  Okay, change quest.
[4562.70s -> 4565.96s]  Act 2.
[4565.96s -> 4568.90s]  We'll do...
[4568.90s -> 4570.90s]  The Lord of Lies Belial.
[4570.90s -> 4576.54s]  Act 2.
[4576.54s -> 4578.54s]  You can join off me when you're ready.
[4578.54s -> 4582.50s]  What we just were playing right there
[4582.50s -> 4584.50s]  was kind of the beginning of Act 1
[4584.50s -> 4586.50s]  because Burger Boy was on it with another character
[4586.50s -> 4588.50s]  and I was just coming to help him out.
[4588.50s -> 4590.50s]  But now that he's on his actual character
[4590.50s -> 4592.50s]  and I'm on my main character too,
[4592.50s -> 4594.50s]  we're gonna do the boss of Act 2 again.
[4594.50s -> 4596.50s]  Just because he's
[4596.50s -> 4598.50s]  a very major boss,
[4598.50s -> 4603.94s]  cool to farm,
[4603.94s -> 4610.60s]  maybe get some good stuff.
[4610.60s -> 4612.60s]  No, getting good items does not cost $2.50.
[4612.60s -> 4616.50s]  It costs nothing.
[4616.50s -> 4618.74s]  Unless, of course,
[4618.74s -> 4620.74s]  the real money auction house is coming out at some point.
[4620.74s -> 4622.74s]  We don't know when in the next few days.
[4622.74s -> 4626.39s]  Okay, this is what I'm talking about.
[4626.39s -> 4628.82s]  This is gonna get difficult.
[4628.82s -> 4633.62s]  So all about being prepared.
[4633.62s -> 4637.46s]  With that cleave.
[4637.46s -> 4641.94s]  Let's get this sped up. Frenzy mode.
[4641.94s -> 4644.63s]  I love frenzy.
[4644.63s -> 4651.16s]  Stop them!
[4651.16s -> 4656.15s]  Oh, I'm taking some hits now.
[4656.15s -> 4658.52s]  That's what I'm talking about.
[4658.52s -> 4660.52s]  I want to take that pain, take that suffering.
[4660.52s -> 4666.47s]  No, don't stand on the poison.
[4666.47s -> 4675.42s]  Yeah! Nice.
[4675.42s -> 4681.75s]  Do I think the real money auction house is a good idea?
[4683.75s -> 4686.82s]  Tough to say.
[4686.82s -> 4689.83s]  Well, I gotta go activate this.
[4689.83s -> 4692.58s]  Tough to say, because
[4692.58s -> 4694.58s]  it's one of those things where
[4694.58s -> 4696.58s]  Diablo is supposed to be all about finding the loot.
[4696.58s -> 4698.58s]  And, oh, you found this, you found that.
[4698.58s -> 4700.58s]  But with the auction house,
[4700.58s -> 4702.58s]  it kind of makes it
[4702.58s -> 4704.58s]  oh, let me just go buy
[4704.58s -> 4706.58s]  whatever I want from the auction house.
[4706.58s -> 4708.58s]  I don't have to find anything.
[4708.58s -> 4710.58s]  And to me, that kind of takes away from the game a little bit.
[4710.58s -> 4712.58s]  But most people probably aren't going to
[4712.58s -> 4714.58s]  really use it that often.
[4714.58s -> 4716.76s]  I'm not sure.
[4716.76s -> 4718.76s]  But yeah, that's my opinion. I think that a real money
[4718.76s -> 4720.76s]  auction house makes it so you can just buy whatever you want.
[4720.76s -> 4722.76s]  And have the best gear in the game
[4722.76s -> 4724.76s]  and you really maybe didn't even play.
[4724.76s -> 4726.76s]  You didn't even like try and get it.
[4726.76s -> 4728.76s]  I'm an old school Diablo guy.
[4728.76s -> 4730.76s]  I was all about farming the same boss over and over and over
[4730.76s -> 4732.76s]  and over again until you got that one item you wanted.
[4732.76s -> 4735.06s]  But it's cool.
[4735.06s -> 4737.06s]  It's something new. Something interesting
[4737.06s -> 4739.06s]  that they added.
[4739.06s -> 4741.06s]  That kid's going to like
[4741.06s -> 4743.06s]  get way better gear than you.
[4743.06s -> 4745.06s]  It's going to piss you off, isn't it?
[4745.06s -> 4747.06s]  No, I don't care.
[4747.06s -> 4749.06s]  Just me personally,
[4749.06s -> 4751.06s]  I probably won't use the real money auction house.
[4751.06s -> 4753.06s]  At least right off the bat.
[4753.06s -> 4757.22s]  Oh god, don't stand in that.
[4757.22s -> 4764.50s]  Get over here.
[4764.50s -> 4766.50s]  Don't stand in that lighting.
[4766.50s -> 4770.86s]  It'll be your demise.
[4770.86s -> 4772.86s]  Besides the barbarian, the wizard.
[4772.86s -> 4774.86s]  I have a level 17 wizard I haven't really been playing with lately.
[4774.86s -> 4777.16s]  But probably the wizard.
[4777.16s -> 4781.06s]  I gotta run away from that.
[4781.06s -> 4785.35s]  See the problem with this build?
[4785.35s -> 4787.35s]  Oh boy, we got, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[4787.35s -> 4790.30s]  We got a couple of
[4790.30s -> 4792.47s]  elite creatures over here.
[4792.47s -> 4795.35s]  Oh, they're all doing that
[4795.35s -> 4797.35s]  lightning thing.
[4797.35s -> 4800.87s]  I can't even stand near them.
[4800.87s -> 4805.42s]  Oh god, I gotta try and single them out.
[4805.42s -> 4809.45s]  I keep doing that mirror thing too.
[4809.45s -> 4814.06s]  That's annoying.
[4814.06s -> 4816.36s]  Get out of here.
[4816.36s -> 4818.86s]  Alright, I'm going Super Saiyan.
[4818.86s -> 4821.35s]  You got nothing on me.
[4821.35s -> 4824.42s]  Super Saiyan mode.
[4824.42s -> 4827.69s]  Any good drops?
[4827.69s -> 4829.69s]  Sick. What'd you get?
[4829.69s -> 4832.50s]  Oh, nothing. That was just a
[4832.50s -> 4836.28s]  destructive...
[4836.28s -> 4838.28s]  If you buy too much stuff, won't it defeat the purpose of
[4838.28s -> 4840.28s]  Diablo?
[4840.28s -> 4842.28s]  Yeah, that's my opinion.
[4842.28s -> 4844.28s]  A lot of people share the same opinion.
[4844.28s -> 4846.28s]  But there's also a lot of people that say,
[4846.28s -> 4848.28s]  and it's very warranted,
[4848.28s -> 4850.28s]  they say, I don't have time to grind
[4850.28s -> 4852.28s]  the same boss over and over and over and over again.
[4852.28s -> 4854.28s]  Oh by the way, we're about to
[4854.28s -> 4856.28s]  you're about to see a boss, a major boss,
[4856.28s -> 4858.28s]  so if you don't want to see it, then you don't want to see it.
[4858.28s -> 4860.28s]  So I recommend clicking
[4860.28s -> 4862.28s]  away from the screen for a second,
[4862.28s -> 4864.28s]  because you're about to see a major Act boss.
[4864.28s -> 4868.63s]  Oh, we're skipping the scene anyways, right?
[4868.63s -> 4870.63s]  Yeah, we're skipping it, but still, it doesn't really matter.
[4870.63s -> 4876.52s]  Spoiler alert!
[4876.52s -> 4883.54s]  But this
[4883.54s -> 4885.54s]  guy is probably going to be incredibly
[4885.54s -> 4887.54s]  difficult with just me and you.
[4887.54s -> 4892.15s]  This is Act 2.
[4892.15s -> 4894.15s]  What was your question, Brunden? Sorry, I'll answer it.
[4894.15s -> 4896.15s]  Ask it again. I apologize.
[4896.15s -> 4898.97s]  I'm trying to pay attention to
[4898.97s -> 4900.97s]  five different things at once here, so sorry.
[4900.97s -> 4906.98s]  Got to get rid of his snake ads.
[4906.98s -> 4910.50s]  Yeah, we're
[4910.50s -> 4912.50s]  definitely going to wipe. There's no way we're going to do this.
[4912.50s -> 4914.74s]  Maybe we will.
[4914.74s -> 4916.74s]  This guy's quite difficult.
[4916.74s -> 4922.38s]  Actually, we can show
[4922.38s -> 4924.38s]  this. Oh, no, we don't.
[4924.38s -> 4926.74s]  It doesn't matter.
[4926.74s -> 4929.18s]  Get him!
[4929.18s -> 4933.14s]  Sick of minion!
[4933.14s -> 4935.96s]  I only have one potion,
[4935.96s -> 4937.96s]  dude. This is going to be really bad.
[4937.96s -> 4940.90s]  This is going to be really, really bad.
[4940.90s -> 4943.85s]  Getting annihilated already.
[4943.85s -> 4945.85s]  We are going to get
[4945.85s -> 4947.85s]  so owned, it's not even funny.
[4947.85s -> 4950.86s]  Oh, he's almost like
[4950.86s -> 4952.86s]  Half-Life. Not bad.
[4952.86s -> 4955.99s]  Are you forgetting the most important
[4955.99s -> 4961.11s]  thing? I don't.
[4961.11s -> 4965.40s]  Crush him. I'm saving my Super Saiyan
[4965.40s -> 4967.40s]  for when we really need it, because we're really
[4967.40s -> 4969.58s]  going to need it.
[4969.58s -> 4971.58s]  He's just about to give up.
[4971.58s -> 4973.58s]  Kill that ad. We don't want this guy here.
[4973.58s -> 4976.01s]  We want this guy gone.
[4976.01s -> 4985.59s]  Let's see...
[4985.59s -> 4987.59s]  Am I going to Dreamhack?
[4987.59s -> 4989.59s]  Uh, it's
[4989.59s -> 4991.59s]  probably not. It's across the world, and I don't really have
[4991.59s -> 4993.59s]  the funds, I guess,
[4993.59s -> 4995.59s]  to travel across the world.
[4995.59s -> 4998.41s]  Okay, this is where it gets nuts.
[4998.41s -> 5000.65s]  Oh, god. Oh, god. I'm literally
[5000.65s -> 5002.65s]  scared. We're going to wipe right in the first two seconds.
[5002.65s -> 5004.65s]  We're going to wipe in the first two seconds.
[5004.65s -> 5006.65s]  Probably.
[5006.65s -> 5010.55s]  Oh, god.
[5010.55s -> 5012.79s]  I have like half health.
[5012.79s -> 5014.79s]  We're dead.
[5014.79s -> 5017.35s]  Oh, me too.
[5017.35s -> 5019.35s]  Alright, let's go Super Saiyan. Give me that health, yes.
[5019.35s -> 5023.90s]  Oh, come on.
[5023.90s -> 5026.20s]  We got to burn up as quick as we can.
[5026.20s -> 5028.20s]  He's crushing me right now.
[5028.20s -> 5030.50s]  He's going to do the poison thing.
[5030.50s -> 5032.50s]  He's going to do the poison thing.
[5032.50s -> 5034.50s]  When he does it, make a run for it.
[5034.50s -> 5037.00s]  Try not to stand in it. There it is.
[5037.00s -> 5039.00s]  Don't stand in it. Oh, no!
[5039.00s -> 5041.00s]  Oh, that was so close.
[5041.00s -> 5043.00s]  I get the orb.
[5043.00s -> 5045.00s]  Get away.
[5045.00s -> 5047.00s]  That was so close. He does this
[5047.00s -> 5050.65s]  for so long on Nightmare.
[5050.65s -> 5052.65s]  Alright, come on. Here we go.
[5052.65s -> 5054.65s]  Come on, come on, come on.
[5054.65s -> 5056.65s]  Pick up that health.
[5056.65s -> 5061.00s]  There's a health right in front of you. Don't get it yet.
[5061.00s -> 5063.00s]  Oh, dear.
[5063.00s -> 5065.00s]  I didn't hold shift.
[5065.00s -> 5067.00s]  There's another health there. We'll be okay.
[5067.00s -> 5069.00s]  I'm going to grab it. I need it.
[5069.00s -> 5075.13s]  Watch out.
[5075.13s -> 5077.43s]  Oh, crap.
[5077.43s -> 5079.67s]  Get that health globe. I'm alright.
[5079.67s -> 5084.92s]  Here he goes. Here he goes. Run.
[5084.92s -> 5086.92s]  Run around. Don't stand in it.
[5086.92s -> 5089.80s]  Oh, no.
[5089.80s -> 5091.80s]  I'm so dead. I died.
[5091.80s -> 5093.80s]  Are you dead? Oh, no.
[5093.80s -> 5095.80s]  Can I revive you? Can I revive you?
[5095.80s -> 5097.80s]  Come on. Come on.
[5097.80s -> 5100.30s]  Oh, this is bad.
[5100.30s -> 5102.30s]  This is bad.
[5102.30s -> 5105.50s]  Oh, no. It's over.
[5105.50s -> 5108.12s]  Get that health.
[5108.12s -> 5110.30s]  You know what I have to do? I have to do it
[5110.30s -> 5112.30s]  right now.
[5112.30s -> 5114.66s]  Right now. Come on.
[5114.66s -> 5116.66s]  Come on, you son of a bitch. Yes.
[5116.66s -> 5118.66s]  Alright, run.
[5118.66s -> 5122.44s]  We got to do some damage to him.
[5122.44s -> 5124.44s]  He's not dropping any globes.
[5124.44s -> 5126.81s]  There's one. There's one.
[5126.81s -> 5128.81s]  Alright, good. Smoke him. Smoke him.
[5128.81s -> 5130.81s]  Watch out. Watch out. Watch out.
[5130.81s -> 5132.81s]  Oh, I'm stuck in the corner over here.
[5132.81s -> 5134.81s]  I just died again.
[5134.81s -> 5136.81s]  No.
[5136.81s -> 5138.81s]  Oh, my God.
[5138.81s -> 5140.81s]  No, don't die.
[5140.81s -> 5142.81s]  Oh, I'm so dead. It is over.
[5142.81s -> 5145.88s]  Super Saiyan mode.
[5145.88s -> 5147.88s]  Go. Go. Smash him. Smash him. Smash him. Smash him.
[5147.88s -> 5154.58s]  No.
[5154.58s -> 5156.58s]  Oh, it's over. We're dead.
[5156.58s -> 5158.95s]  Oh, it's going to hit me and I'm going to die.
[5158.95s -> 5160.95s]  I need to get a globe out of him.
[5160.95s -> 5166.31s]  It's over, regardless.
[5166.31s -> 5168.68s]  That was disappointing.
[5168.68s -> 5170.68s]  Yeah, it was a little too hard.
[5170.68s -> 5172.68s]  A little too hard.
[5172.68s -> 5174.68s]  I just got to go repair.
[5174.68s -> 5177.18s]  We know what we need.
[5177.18s -> 5180.82s]  We need to get potions.
[5180.82s -> 5182.82s]  I didn't have any potions.
[5182.82s -> 5184.82s]  I had like one potion. Going back to Tom.
[5184.82s -> 5187.58s]  Damn.
[5187.58s -> 5193.59s]  We got him down to half.
[5193.59s -> 5195.59s]  Sorry, I was paying attention to that craziness.
[5195.59s -> 5198.15s]  When you die, you don't lose your character.
[5198.15s -> 5200.15s]  No, you don't. That's hardcore mode only.
[5200.15s -> 5202.15s]  If we just lost our characters right there,
[5202.15s -> 5204.15s]  I would have peed my pants and then like
[5204.15s -> 5206.15s]  pooed my pants immediately after peeing.
[5206.15s -> 5208.15s]  I would have never played this game again.
[5208.15s -> 5210.52s]  All right.
[5210.52s -> 5212.52s]  The potion person is down here in town.
[5212.52s -> 5215.91s]  And yeah, I absolutely will do arenas.
[5215.91s -> 5220.97s]  Absolutely.
[5220.97s -> 5222.97s]  I can't wait for them to come out to be honest.
[5222.97s -> 5226.81s]  It's going to be awesome. I need to go.
[5226.81s -> 5230.90s]  Where's the potion person?
[5230.90s -> 5232.90s]  I think they're like in another little area, aren't they?
[5232.90s -> 5237.13s]  Oh, they're all over here. I'm thinking of Act 3.
[5237.13s -> 5240.97s]  Yeah, I got to think of a good arena team.
[5240.97s -> 5243.21s]  Because
[5243.21s -> 5245.96s]  there's going to be a lot of options.
[5245.96s -> 5250.76s]  Bye, bye, bye, bye.
[5250.76s -> 5255.94s]  Super health potions.
[5255.94s -> 5259.40s]  Okay. Yeah, this game is awesome
[5259.40s -> 5261.40s]  for solo. The reason why me and him are having trouble
[5261.40s -> 5263.40s]  right now is because this is nightmare.
[5263.40s -> 5265.40s]  This is on a higher difficulty mode.
[5265.40s -> 5267.40s]  And when there's
[5267.40s -> 5270.09s]  more than one person in a game,
[5270.09s -> 5272.09s]  it makes the game like twice
[5272.09s -> 5274.09s]  as hard.
[5274.09s -> 5276.09s]  So when three people are in the game, it's three times as hard.
[5276.09s -> 5278.09s]  When four people are in the game, it is at max difficulty.
[5278.09s -> 5283.98s]  All right.
[5283.98s -> 5287.43s]  Are you ready to try this again?
[5287.43s -> 5289.43s]  Yeah.
[5289.43s -> 5291.43s]  If we wipe again, then we're going to have to go back
[5291.43s -> 5293.99s]  and we should be
[5293.99s -> 5295.99s]  all right this time. We didn't have potions.
[5295.99s -> 5297.99s]  You got potions, right?
[5297.99s -> 5299.99s]  I got four. I'll be good.
[5299.99s -> 5301.99s]  All right. You sure? I don't know about that.
[5301.99s -> 5303.99s]  Four potions doesn't seem like very much.
[5303.99s -> 5305.99s]  I better put on the heroic ones, too.
[5305.99s -> 5308.74s]  Let's go.
[5308.74s -> 5314.18s]  Here we go again.
[5314.18s -> 5319.05s]  We're doing it again.
[5319.05s -> 5324.81s]  Let's do it. Nightmare.
[5324.81s -> 5331.02s]  You know what I'm going to put on?
[5331.02s -> 5333.02s]  I got to put on a different passive.
[5333.02s -> 5335.70s]  Where is it?
[5335.70s -> 5337.88s]  I forgot to do a better offensive move.
[5337.88s -> 5339.88s]  When we have a second here,
[5339.88s -> 5341.88s]  I'm going to put on the health globe one because we get more health globes.
[5341.88s -> 5344.76s]  Because we need them bad, bad, bad.
[5344.76s -> 5346.76s]  I'm going to hide behind your minions.
[5346.76s -> 5349.13s]  All right. Let's do it.
[5349.13s -> 5351.13s]  What am I going to replace it with?
[5351.13s -> 5353.62s]  Where is it?
[5353.62s -> 5355.62s]  Take it. Thank you very much.
[5355.62s -> 5358.25s]  So what this is going to do, guys,
[5358.25s -> 5360.25s]  is I just put on a passive ability
[5360.25s -> 5362.25s]  that makes it so much more
[5362.25s -> 5364.25s]  health globes drop and they heal for much more.
[5364.25s -> 5366.25s]  The health globes are little
[5366.25s -> 5368.25s]  health bubbles you see on the ground.
[5368.25s -> 5376.81s]  This is absolutely
[5376.81s -> 5379.75s]  worth getting.
[5379.75s -> 5381.75s]  Troy Thorn. What's up, man?
[5381.75s -> 5384.63s]  I'm not sure I'm going to be able
[5384.63s -> 5386.63s]  to make it to Pax Prime.
[5386.63s -> 5389.00s]  The only reason is because it's just a lot of money.
[5389.00s -> 5391.00s]  I don't have the money to fly out there.
[5391.00s -> 5393.30s]  I think the tickets are even sold out now,
[5393.30s -> 5396.12s]  to be honest.
[5396.12s -> 5398.12s]  So I'm probably not going to make it to Pax Prime.
[5398.12s -> 5400.12s]  We'll see, though. I'm not totally
[5400.12s -> 5403.64s]  ruling it out of the question.
[5403.64s -> 5405.64s]  All right. I'm doing much better this time. Much more controlled.
[5405.64s -> 5410.31s]  I died twice
[5410.31s -> 5412.31s]  last time. Can't blame you
[5412.31s -> 5414.74s]  for that.
[5414.74s -> 5417.05s]  Are you going to watch that poison?
[5417.05s -> 5420.55s]  My guy's like
[5420.55s -> 5422.55s]  too, like,
[5422.55s -> 5424.55s]  his back is too ush to run.
[5424.55s -> 5428.71s]  I was
[5428.71s -> 5430.71s]  at Pax East. I was at Pax East.
[5430.71s -> 5433.02s]  All right. Here we go.
[5433.02s -> 5435.02s]  Wow. We destroyed him that time.
[5435.02s -> 5437.38s]  Yeah. Well,
[5437.38s -> 5440.14s]  this is the part that matters.
[5440.14s -> 5442.14s]  And here we go.
[5442.14s -> 5445.02s]  Thank you, Geronimo.
[5445.02s -> 5447.02s]  Whatever your name is. Thank you so much.
[5447.02s -> 5449.02s]  All right. This is where we go. Super Saiyan!
[5449.02s -> 5451.77s]  Puke. All over.
[5451.77s -> 5453.77s]  All right. Leave the health globes alone.
[5453.77s -> 5455.77s]  Let them stay. Let them stick around for a little bit.
[5455.77s -> 5460.12s]  You know what I mean? Until we need them.
[5460.12s -> 5462.12s]  I'm going to grab this one now. This one right next to me.
[5462.12s -> 5464.12s]  Good. This health globe thing was something I absolutely
[5464.12s -> 5467.13s]  should have had on from the beginning.
[5467.13s -> 5469.13s]  So what you're saying, it's all your fault.
[5469.13s -> 5471.13s]  Pretty much it's all my fault.
[5473.82s -> 5475.82s]  Watch it. There we go. Oh, no. Not again.
[5475.82s -> 5477.82s]  Anything but this.
[5477.82s -> 5479.82s]  Try and stay away from each other. We're going to like bump into each other.
[5479.82s -> 5484.62s]  All right. Let's do it.
[5484.62s -> 5487.37s]  Start it up. Start smashing.
[5487.37s -> 5489.37s]  Health globe. Health globes everywhere
[5489.37s -> 5491.54s]  now. We're good.
[5491.54s -> 5493.54s]  Or are we? Maybe I spoke a little too soon.
[5493.54s -> 5495.54s]  I had to take a potion.
[5495.54s -> 5497.98s]  Take as many as you need.
[5497.98s -> 5499.98s]  You're the tank.
[5499.98s -> 5503.18s]  Oh, don't you spray that at me.
[5503.18s -> 5505.18s]  How dare you?
[5505.18s -> 5511.18s]  I'm running this way.
[5511.18s -> 5513.18s]  He's going to do that thing again. Very, very soon.
[5513.18s -> 5515.18s]  Oh, here it comes.
[5515.18s -> 5517.18s]  Yeah, it's definitely coming like right now.
[5517.18s -> 5519.18s]  Oh, you had to do that right before
[5519.18s -> 5521.61s]  you did this. Here it is.
[5521.61s -> 5523.61s]  Oh, no. Oh, don't get clubbed to the quarter.
[5523.61s -> 5527.32s]  Don't get clubbed to the quarter.
[5527.32s -> 5530.07s]  Oh, my God. Oh, no.
[5530.07s -> 5532.76s]  Oh, I got hit by one.
[5532.76s -> 5535.13s]  We're good. We're good. We're good.
[5535.13s -> 5538.90s]  Even those dogs are like upset about this.
[5538.90s -> 5540.90s]  We got it. We got it. We got it. We got it.
[5540.90s -> 5546.58s]  So
[5546.58s -> 5548.58s]  pissed about it. So funny.
[5548.58s -> 5550.58s]  Dude,
[5550.58s -> 5552.58s]  this is getting so intense. Even like the dogs
[5552.58s -> 5554.95s]  are getting intense.
[5554.95s -> 5557.70s]  Oh, no.
[5557.70s -> 5559.70s]  He's going to do it one more time. It's going to happen probably like
[5559.70s -> 5563.10s]  right now. I'm going to have
[5563.10s -> 5565.10s]  super saiyan mode one more time.
[5565.10s -> 5567.10s]  Come on. Oh, no.
[5567.10s -> 5569.10s]  Watch it. Here it is. Here it is.
[5569.10s -> 5571.72s]  Oh, this is the last one.
[5571.72s -> 5575.11s]  That's it. We got to only deal with this last one
[5575.11s -> 5578.38s]  and we'll kill him.
[5578.38s -> 5581.13s]  Yes.
[5581.13s -> 5583.13s]  All right. Burn him. I'm going super saiyan.
[5583.13s -> 5585.43s]  To death.
[5585.43s -> 5587.43s]  Burn him. Burn him.
[5587.43s -> 5589.43s]  Kill him. Oh, legendary.
[5589.43s -> 5591.43s]  Come on. Oh, it's over, baby. Legendary.
[5591.43s -> 5593.43s]  Legendary. Legendary.
[5593.43s -> 5595.43s]  Legendary. Come on.
[5595.43s -> 5599.59s]  Crap.
[5599.59s -> 5601.77s]  Kidding me.
[5601.77s -> 5603.77s]  What is that? Garbage.
[5607.86s -> 5612.79s]  Oh, man.
[5612.79s -> 5614.79s]  All that for blues.
[5614.79s -> 5616.79s]  I just got blues too.
[5616.79s -> 5620.50s]  Rage. Quit.
[5620.50s -> 5622.50s]  Rage. Quit.
[5622.50s -> 5624.87s]  Oh, well.
[5624.87s -> 5626.87s]  That was pretty difficult. Not going to lie.
[5626.87s -> 5632.06s]  Where is auto?
[5632.06s -> 5635.06s]  Auto. Auto.
[5635.06s -> 5638.20s]  I don't want to move on.
[5638.20s -> 5640.20s]  Where are they?
[5640.20s -> 5642.20s]  Where is shibby stealth star? Where is everybody?
[5642.20s -> 5644.20s]  Get a four player action going.
[5644.20s -> 5646.63s]  Continue on to act three.
[5646.63s -> 5648.63s]  I would absolutely say that.
[5648.63s -> 5652.98s]  That actually was not auto.
[5652.98s -> 5654.98s]  That was Burger Boy's two dogs.
[5654.98s -> 5656.98s]  He has two big crazy dogs.
[5656.98s -> 5658.98s]  They're like 180 pounds each.
[5658.98s -> 5660.98s]  They both like
[5660.98s -> 5662.98s]  they stand six feet tall.
[5662.98s -> 5666.38s]  I got to
[5666.38s -> 5669.64s]  check on the stuff I just got.
[5669.64s -> 5671.64s]  Well, that was a bad crate.
[5671.64s -> 5673.64s]  Yeah, it was.
[5673.64s -> 5675.64s]  That was like a crate eight.
[5675.64s -> 5678.65s]  No strangers, no nothing.
[5678.65s -> 5680.65s]  The only crates I ever opened.
[5680.65s -> 5682.65s]  The real problem here is
[5682.65s -> 5684.65s]  we've got to get magic find.
[5684.65s -> 5686.65s]  I don't have like any. You don't have any.
[5686.65s -> 5688.65s]  We need like 100 percent
[5688.65s -> 5693.83s]  extra magic find.
[5693.83s -> 5697.86s]  I'm going to save those for shibby.
[5697.86s -> 5699.86s]  These
[5699.86s -> 5702.68s]  are actually not that great.
[5702.68s -> 5705.05s]  I'm selling them.
[5705.05s -> 5707.05s]  Could I sell them in the auction house?
[5707.05s -> 5709.05s]  Probably not. The stats on these are really just
[5709.05s -> 5711.67s]  dumb. I'm selling them.
[5711.67s -> 5713.67s]  Sockets are good, but not
[5713.67s -> 5715.67s]  I'm not really too concerned about it.
[5715.67s -> 5721.37s]  This is not that bad, but I got better.
[5721.37s -> 5724.12s]  This is
[5724.12s -> 5727.26s]  not that good. This is not that good.
[5727.26s -> 5729.26s]  And this is not that good.
[5729.26s -> 5731.94s]  Alright. Actually, I think I had auctions
[5731.94s -> 5733.94s]  that were going. I wonder if they sold.
[5733.94s -> 5738.30s]  I'm going to check on my auctions for a second.
[5738.30s -> 5740.30s]  Okay. So I'm going to
[5740.30s -> 5742.60s]  show you guys the auction house.
[5742.60s -> 5744.60s]  I'm doing the same. Okay.
[5744.60s -> 5746.60s]  So this is the auction house.
[5746.60s -> 5748.60s]  So what you do here is
[5748.60s -> 5750.60s]  you go to equipment, gems,
[5750.60s -> 5752.60s]  crafting, recipes, pages,
[5752.60s -> 5754.60s]  and you can search for stuff. So let's say right now I'm level
[5754.60s -> 5756.60s]  43. So let's say I want something in
[5756.60s -> 5758.60s]  40, the 40 to 45
[5758.60s -> 5760.97s]  range, right?
[5760.97s -> 5762.97s]  And I want one-handed
[5762.97s -> 5764.97s]  weapons. And it doesn't matter
[5764.97s -> 5766.97s]  what one-handed, I want it to be rare
[5766.97s -> 5768.97s]  though. I want it to be of rare quality.
[5768.97s -> 5770.97s]  So right now I just hit search. These are people
[5770.97s -> 5772.97s]  that are selling things on the
[5772.97s -> 5775.46s]  auction house in
[5775.46s -> 5777.46s]  that particular category
[5777.46s -> 5779.46s]  that I just mentioned. So right now
[5779.46s -> 5781.46s]  if you take a look at this, this guy is absolutely
[5781.46s -> 5783.46s]  not going to sell this. This thing, he's selling this for
[5783.46s -> 5785.46s]  8 million gold. Which is
[5785.46s -> 5787.46s]  I mean, I don't
[5787.46s -> 5789.46s]  know if you're like going to sell that.
[5789.46s -> 5791.46s]  But see, what you can do is
[5791.46s -> 5793.46s]  you can play the auction house, right? You can play the field.
[5793.46s -> 5795.46s]  So you go back to like the
[5795.46s -> 5797.46s]  bids and the buyouts to some of the cheaper stuff.
[5797.46s -> 5799.70s]  There's a lot of pages
[5799.70s -> 5802.90s]  as you can see. And Burger Boy
[5802.90s -> 5804.90s]  is going to like puke on
[5804.90s -> 5806.90s]  his microphone.
[5806.90s -> 5808.90s]  See this is the least expensive one in here
[5808.90s -> 5810.90s]  for the level 40 to 45 range.
[5810.90s -> 5812.90s]  $115,000. So if I bought this
[5812.90s -> 5814.90s]  right now, I have $118,000.
[5814.90s -> 5816.90s]  If I bought this
[5816.90s -> 5818.90s]  right now for $115,000
[5818.90s -> 5820.90s]  I mean it really wouldn't be that
[5820.90s -> 5823.40s]  good.
[5823.40s -> 5825.40s]  Because obviously you can
[5825.40s -> 5827.40s]  find stuff, you can make stuff. Or you could buy this
[5827.40s -> 5829.40s]  and then resell it and try and get more money
[5829.40s -> 5832.09s]  for it. But for now
[5832.09s -> 5834.09s]  let's go to my completed auctions.
[5834.09s -> 5836.90s]  See I put this up for $160,000
[5836.90s -> 5841.13s]  gold.
[5841.13s -> 5843.13s]  This should have sold though. This is $14,000
[5843.13s -> 5846.90s]  that's like chump change.
[5846.90s -> 5848.90s]  You can see your past auctions.
[5848.90s -> 5850.90s]  This is like the money that I've
[5850.90s -> 5852.90s]  made. Money that I've made.
[5852.90s -> 5855.59s]  Money that I've purchased.
[5855.59s -> 5857.59s]  See it can get really really addicting.
[5857.59s -> 5859.96s]  It can get really addicting.
[5859.96s -> 5868.41s]  Eventually
[5868.41s -> 5873.08s]  see currency.
[5873.08s -> 5875.08s]  The real currency auction house will be available
[5875.08s -> 5877.08s]  at a later date. $529.
[5877.08s -> 5879.08s]  So in a couple weeks you're going to
[5879.08s -> 5881.08s]  be able to use real money
[5881.08s -> 5883.08s]  to buy things. People are going to be able
[5883.08s -> 5885.08s]  to put like oh here's my
[5885.08s -> 5887.08s]  attack weapon thing.
[5887.08s -> 5889.08s]  It's $5.
[5889.08s -> 5891.08s]  Real money. And it's going to be totally
[5891.08s -> 5893.08s]  legal, totally encouraged. It's going to be
[5893.08s -> 5895.08s]  ridiculous.
