[0.31s -> 12.75s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a little gem.
[13.13s -> 16.89s]  This is the new series, if you missed the one from last week, where every Friday
[16.89s -> 23.35s]  I'm gonna go over my favorite mobile games, whether that be Android, iPhone, or iPad, and this week
[23.45s -> 29.97s]  we're gonna talk about Super Crate Box. Now a lot of you guys might already be aware of this game because it came out back in
[30.21s -> 35.27s]  2010 as a freeware PC game. That's right. You can go play this right now for free.
[35.31s -> 37.03s]  You don't have to download it, you don't have to buy it,
[37.03s -> 42.92s]  but I would highly recommend you actually do buy this game, and here are the reasons why. I'm gonna go over the game in general,
[42.92s -> 44.72s]  what the hell this thing even is.
[44.72s -> 48.80s]  So at its core, this game is an arcade shooter, and it's a platformer,
[48.80s -> 52.16s]  but the platforming is really just to dodge enemies and not get yourself killed.
[52.16s -> 57.88s]  It is one life, if you get hit you die, and the whole point of this game is to collect these crates.
[58.04s -> 61.92s]  They are gonna randomly drop in random places on the map, and there's not very many places
[62.00s -> 66.44s]  they can be, because as you see the levels are not that large, and as you collect these crates,
[66.44s -> 69.64s]  you're going to get another random weapon. It's a weapon crate.
[69.64s -> 73.92s]  So if I pick this up and I get a machine gun, that means I'll have a machine gun until I pick up the next
[73.92s -> 80.60s]  crate, and some of the weapons are very very good, and some of them are very hard to use or just straight-up bad,
[80.60s -> 82.40s]  and that's the nature of this game.
[82.40s -> 87.12s]  It is all random, and the point is to get as many crates as you possibly can,
[87.30s -> 91.76s]  while defending yourself against waves and waves and waves and waves of enemies.
[91.80s -> 95.32s]  And if you check out the bottom of the screen, there's gonna be a fire pit there.
[95.32s -> 99.44s]  If they fall in that, if any enemy goes into that, they don't die.
[99.56s -> 104.88s]  They reappear at the top of the screen, turn red, and run really really fast.
[105.04s -> 109.25s]  So as you go during this game, as you pick up crates, you're gonna unlock a bunch of stuff.
[109.25s -> 111.69s]  You're gonna unlock new items, new characters, new levels.
[111.73s -> 115.57s]  It's just the whole thing is very very addicting, and it's very hard too.
[115.57s -> 119.33s]  This is not an easy game. You will die over and over and over again.
[119.57s -> 124.73s]  Think of it as like Super Meat Boy meets that game mode in Super Mario Brothers 3.
[124.85s -> 128.45s]  If you guys remember what I'm talking about, that old, that kind of looks similar too,
[128.45s -> 132.29s]  the level design is similar, where you were Super Mario, the POW button was right there,
[132.29s -> 134.61s]  and you had to kill all the enemies and collect the coins.
[134.93s -> 139.25s]  That's sort of what this game reminds me of, but at a much more hardcore level.
[139.65s -> 146.04s]  And speaking of hardcore, if you're looking for a challenge, this game definitely brings it, and brings it hard.
[146.52s -> 151.72s]  The normal mode is pretty difficult, but after you beat the normal mode at a certain amount of points,
[151.72s -> 157.40s]  you're gonna unlock SFMT, which makes more enemies spawn at a much faster rate,
[157.40s -> 159.32s]  making things incredibly difficult.
[159.32s -> 163.80s]  And then after you beat that at a certain point score, you're gonna unlock Ambush,
[163.80s -> 166.52s]  and it's just it's just crazy. They keep throwing all these challenges at you,
[166.52s -> 170.68s]  make the game progressively harder, and then it's all about personal records.
[170.68s -> 175.16s]  How far did you get in Ambush? How far did you get in SFMT? How far did you get in normal mode?
[175.16s -> 180.12s]  And they keep all these records for you that you addictingly want to break them all over and over again.
[180.12s -> 182.76s]  They remind you of this all the time.
[182.76s -> 185.64s]  Every single time you die, it's gonna pop up on the screen.
[185.64s -> 188.92s]  Hey, you died, but you know, you were pretty close to unlocking a character.
[188.92s -> 193.56s]  Get like five more crates, and you get a new character, or 20 new crates, you get a new weapon,
[193.56s -> 196.52s]  or a hundred new crates, and you might unlock this new game mode.
[196.52s -> 200.12s]  So it's just like, I gotta unlock everything, because I'm that type of person.
[200.12s -> 203.24s]  I have a very addicting personality, where if I sit down with an iPhone game,
[203.32s -> 206.60s]  I'm gonna sit there, and even when somebody tries to tell me to stop,
[206.60s -> 210.77s]  for instance, I will sit in the doctor's office, and they'll call my name, and I'll go,
[210.77s -> 214.45s]  damn it, I wish they didn't call my name, I want to get a hundred crates.
[214.45s -> 216.61s]  That is what this game is going to do to you.
[216.61s -> 223.57s]  This game is $1.99, two bucks on the iTunes store, and it is not currently on Android.
[223.57s -> 228.77s]  But again, you can play it for free on your PC or your Mac, if you go to the website in the description.
[228.77s -> 232.13s]  But like I said in the beginning, this is something you're gonna want to take with you.
[232.39s -> 234.15s]  And that's mainly because it's just so easy.
[234.15s -> 238.23s]  It's just so simple to pull this out of your pocket and start playing wherever you're playing.
[238.23s -> 242.87s]  And any game in this series, I play all these games when I do things that are boring.
[244.07s -> 246.07s]  So that is gonna wrap up this video, guys.
[246.07s -> 248.39s]  Thank you all so much for watching, I really do appreciate it.
[248.39s -> 252.39s]  And go check out Super Crate Box, it is a fantastic little gem of a game,
[252.39s -> 253.27s]  and you see what I did there.
[254.47s -> 258.16s]  But yeah, I'll see you guys all soon, and of course, take care, everybody.
