[0.31s -> 13.50s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[13.50s -> 18.50s]  Gonna be playing tonight as the Soldier, the Black Box Soldier with the Black Box.
[18.50s -> 20.50s]  What else would a Black Box Soldier be using?
[20.50s -> 31.83s]  Also using the buff banner and the equalizer, and this gameplay, guys, is a real testament to why you should never just let somebody cap the last point.
[31.83s -> 38.25s]  Look where the cart is right now. A lot of times when this cart gets to this part on the map, the red team...
[38.25s -> 41.25s]  This is on upward, by the way, forgot to mention that. This is defense on upward.
[41.25s -> 46.25s]  The red team, especially if they're getting rolled, will just let them cap it.
[46.25s -> 53.25s]  I've been guilty of this before myself, where I'll come out of the spawn, see the cart is right there, see four guys on it, and just go,
[53.25s -> 55.25s]  Okay, let's just wait till next round.
[56.25s -> 63.68s]  But this is not one of those gameplays. This is one of those gameplays where the whole team just was like, you know what, screw this.
[63.68s -> 70.68s]  We're all gonna work together. We are going to stop these blue bastards from getting on this point, and my goodness, do we do that.
[70.68s -> 74.68s]  And nobody really says anything. I think it's just kind of a collective mass of thoughts.
[74.68s -> 80.68s]  We're all just kind of telepathically telling each other, Hey, I don't want to lose this match. Let's like really try hard.
[80.68s -> 85.11s]  And a couple of guys switched to medic, and they do very, very well.
[85.11s -> 89.11s]  Guys like Switch and MLC Stealth, they're the reason pretty much why we win the game.
[89.11s -> 95.85s]  So I briefly want to talk about the black box and why I'm using the black box, even when there's medics on the team.
[95.85s -> 101.85s]  Never be afraid to equip this item if there's one, two, three, four, five, a hundred medics on a team.
[101.85s -> 106.15s]  Because all you're going to do is just help your medics heal you faster.
[106.15s -> 110.15s]  I'm going to show you guys, I'm going to go down, we'll do a slow motion to show you what I'm talking about.
[110.15s -> 116.15s]  This happens a little later in the game when we get more than one medic on the team, but the theory stays the same.
[116.15s -> 119.15s]  The black box is going to heal you plus 15 health when you hit anybody.
[119.15s -> 125.15s]  So if you have a medic healing you, you are going to be healed in combat 24 health a second.
[125.15s -> 131.33s]  Now that's great, but imagine this now. It takes about one second to shoot your rocket launcher, 0.8 seconds.
[131.33s -> 139.33s]  So if you turn a corner and there's a large group of people shooting at you, and you shoot one, two, three rockets and hit every single time,
[139.33s -> 146.33s]  that's plus 45 health in three seconds, which turns out to be just about 15 health per second if you land all the shots.
[146.33s -> 155.33s]  So let's say that happens. Now instead of 24 health a second the medic is healing you for, you are actually receiving 39 health a second,
[155.33s -> 159.33s]  which of course is way better than the 24 health a second you receive from a medic.
[159.33s -> 166.50s]  Because that 24 health a second is pretty slow, especially if you want to be really aggressive, especially when you're playing Soldier.
[166.50s -> 171.81s]  So don't rule this out so quickly because it can really keep you on the front lines.
[171.81s -> 176.43s]  So let me transition with that into why I'm using the buff banner.
[176.43s -> 184.80s]  Talking about keeping people on the front lines, keeping your team alert, the buff banner is the absolute quintessential item for that.
[184.80s -> 189.80s]  Because as you'll see here, any time somebody blows a buff banner, every single person on the team,
[189.80s -> 195.80s]  whether it be a medic, engineer, spy, pyro, doesn't matter what class they're playing,
[195.80s -> 204.80s]  everybody wants those mini-crits, and what that does is that allows your entire team to collectively move into one spot
[204.80s -> 209.80s]  and sort of make this wall of instant death to anybody that comes near them.
[209.80s -> 216.80s]  And as you'll see in this gameplay, me and another Soldier, we get quite a few buff banners and it brings everybody to our current location.
[216.80s -> 224.17s]  So absolutely use the buff banner, the shotgun is great, but I would say for situations like this one,
[224.17s -> 228.41s]  or during a stalemate, the buff banner is going to help you out big time.
[228.41s -> 232.97s]  Getting the crit screak right there, but it doesn't really do me a whole lot, get myself killed.
[232.97s -> 235.97s]  I think I get maybe two people with that, pretty sure.
[235.97s -> 240.21s]  But now when you start to hear this noise, when you start to hear that,
[240.21s -> 245.21s]  you know you really got to step your game up a little bit because look at where the cart is.
[245.21s -> 249.77s]  It is literally, if somebody sneezes on that cart, we're done.
[249.77s -> 252.77s]  So I get a heavy off guard here, he comes around the corner with his gloves out,
[252.77s -> 255.77s]  wasn't really prepared for anybody, and they end up faking him out too.
[255.77s -> 258.77s]  Watch, he thinks I'm going to come around this corner, but no, I go this way instead.
[258.77s -> 262.77s]  Get the kill on him, do a little bit of backtracking right here, don't want to get myself killed,
[262.77s -> 265.77s]  get lit on fire and run towards the health.
[265.77s -> 272.77s]  And now this is where I want to talk about the black box and medic healing thingamajigga that I was talking about before.
[272.77s -> 278.26s]  So keep your eye on the lower left, I'm going to slow this down a little bit, so let's watch.
[278.26s -> 281.26s]  Take a look, I never get overhealed during this entire time,
[281.26s -> 284.26s]  and look at how many people are coming around this corner.
[284.26s -> 289.26s]  I am able to sustain all this damage because of course I'm being healed by a medic,
[289.26s -> 292.26s]  and because of all the plus 15s I'm getting.
[292.26s -> 294.26s]  There's plus 15 there, plus 15 there.
[294.26s -> 299.26s]  They never get me to a point where I'm in the red, which is incredibly important.
[299.26s -> 303.57s]  Now obviously the counterpoint to this whole thing, the argument that people will have is,
[303.57s -> 310.57s]  Well, you're missing one rocket, and the only gain you're getting is helping your medic out a little bit while he heals you,
[310.57s -> 314.57s]  and he's going to heal you anyway, so you shouldn't really lose that extra rocket.
[314.57s -> 318.94s]  Now I do agree with this to an extent, but if you're on a team with a lot of people,
[318.94s -> 322.94s]  and the medics are going around healing everybody, you're not being pocketed,
[322.94s -> 325.11s]  then definitely yes, this is something to look into.
[325.11s -> 332.11s]  Now if you are being pocketed 100% by somebody, then yes, this is not really the best option,
[332.11s -> 337.11s]  but it still can work, as you saw just right there, it still works very well.
[337.11s -> 341.54s]  And to be completely honest with you, I probably should have switched rocket launchers at this point,
[341.54s -> 346.54s]  or maybe 30 or 40 seconds before this, only because I'm being pocketed right now.
[346.54s -> 351.54s]  But as you can see, there's not that much time left, so I figured why the hell not, I'm going to stick with it.
[351.54s -> 355.54s]  So this is going to be the end of the gameplay guys, less than 10 seconds left.
[355.54s -> 360.72s]  We push them all the way back to their spawn, and they had a chance to cap it a couple of times,
[360.72s -> 368.09s]  so don't ever give up. So I'll see you guys all next time, and take care everybody. See you soon.
