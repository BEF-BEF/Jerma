[0.31s -> 13.78s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[13.78s -> 19.58s]  And tonight, I'm gonna be playing as the Scout. And this is gonna be a kind of a special Scout video.
[19.58s -> 22.58s]  And not so much special in the sense, I mean, the gameplay is pretty good.
[22.58s -> 29.58s]  But it's my first really tip video for the Scout. I've done one or two of these before, but I never really went into that much detail.
[29.78s -> 34.78s]  So this is gonna be a detailed look at how I play Scout and why I do the things that I do.
[34.78s -> 43.34s]  So really before we get into this at all, I gotta preface this by saying I am not the most fantastic Scout player in the world.
[43.34s -> 51.34s]  I am not like a competitive Scout player. I can only give you the advice that I've learned by experimenting and by just playing in pubs.
[51.34s -> 58.51s]  So I guess take this video with a grain of salt, I guess, because like I said, I'm not a comp player. I never plan on being one.
[58.71s -> 62.71s]  But this is just for the new guys, some of the people that are trying to improve their Scout game.
[62.71s -> 68.19s]  And I'll start off by saying this. Sensitivity does not really matter.
[68.19s -> 74.43s]  A lot of people will ask, Jerma, what is the sensitivity plate to play on on Scout? Do I need a certain sensitivity?
[74.43s -> 77.43s]  And in general, the answer to that question is always gonna be no.
[77.43s -> 84.43s]  You don't have to have some secret magic sensitivity to play any of the classes or to play Scout more specifically.
[84.63s -> 95.00s]  So instead of asking what a sensitivity you should play on, you should find a sensitivity that you're comfortable using and stick with it and never change it.
[95.00s -> 98.00s]  That's the number one thing. I see people do that all the time.
[98.00s -> 105.00s]  They change their sensitivity from 4.2 to 3.1 all the way up to 5.8.
[105.00s -> 112.00s]  And when you do that, you're just kind of relearning the game again because you have to read your muscle memory from your brain to your hand.
[112.20s -> 115.20s]  It has to reconfigure everything it's already learned.
[115.20s -> 120.63s]  So just grab a sensitivity that you like that you can play with all the classes and just stick with it.
[120.63s -> 131.26s]  So now I want to talk about aiming as the Scout and how to improve it and how to make your game a little more cleaner and not so crazy and, you know, ripping the mouse all over the place.
[131.26s -> 135.26s]  This is what I do as the Scout as you'll see on the screen here.
[135.26s -> 140.50s]  You want to do as little mouse movement as humanly possible when you shoot someone.
[140.70s -> 146.70s]  The reason for that is you can shoot somebody with the scatter gun simply by strafing and running around.
[146.70s -> 151.70s]  As you'll see, I don't really move the mouse, especially when I get close to somebody.
[151.70s -> 155.70s]  I don't rip the mouse around and try and aim right at their face or aim at their chest.
[155.70s -> 160.70s]  I sort of let them pass through my vision and I strafe around and I shoot them.
[160.70s -> 164.00s]  That's what you want to start to do as the Scout.
[164.00s -> 170.00s]  You want to stop aiming at people and start strafing around to get them into your crosshair.
[170.63s -> 176.63s]  Now, this is not a 100% you cannot move the mouse, never move the mouse as the Scout.
[176.63s -> 178.63s]  That's not exactly what I'm trying to say.
[178.63s -> 185.63s]  What I'm trying to say is when you get close to somebody, because as the Scout, of course, you have to get really, really close to do any significant damage.
[185.63s -> 191.63s]  You want to try and stop moving around so much with your hand and actually start moving around with your body.
[191.63s -> 195.94s]  Because as we all know, it doesn't matter where you shoot somebody in this game.
[196.14s -> 201.14s]  You could shoot them in their bottom of their stomach, right up to the top of their torso, right in their face.
[201.14s -> 205.14s]  And as long as you get the pellets on them, it's going to do the same amount of damage.
[205.14s -> 210.55s]  So the moral of this story, I guess, is glide, don't jerk.
[210.55s -> 212.55s]  There you go, that's the tagline for the aiming as the Scout.
[212.55s -> 216.18s]  Glide your hand, don't jerk your hand.
[216.18s -> 219.18s]  So next up, I want to talk about a certain technique.
[219.18s -> 224.18s]  I'm not exactly sure what you would call this, but it's the jump over, I guess you could call it.
[225.06s -> 230.06s]  So essentially what's going to happen is when you see a class that will probably kill you in one second.
[230.06s -> 236.06s]  Those classes include the Soldier, the Heavy, and even the Demoman, and sometimes in some cases the Pyro as well.
[236.06s -> 244.42s]  How you want to deal with these people is you want to do your double jump completely over them, turn around and try and get behind them.
[244.42s -> 248.42s]  And a lot of times people will be so confused, they won't even turn around.
[248.42s -> 253.42s]  And if they do turn around, you can get two or three planted shots on them that should kill them.
[253.62s -> 259.62s]  And sometimes there's a lot of cases where you'll jump over somebody that was shooting at you and they just totally forget about you.
[259.62s -> 265.62s]  It's happened to me before as well, I've been a Heavy or a Soldier and a Scout does this technique where he jumps over you.
[265.62s -> 270.62s]  And I'm just like, where the hell did he just go? And you turn around and by that time you're shot in the face.
[270.62s -> 276.24s]  It's a great technique and I suggest you try doing more of it because it can really confuse people.
[276.24s -> 283.67s]  So the last thing that I want to talk about before this video is over is as a Scout, never stop moving.
[283.87s -> 289.87s]  Try and memorize where all the health packs and where the dispensers will be and where all the people will be.
[289.87s -> 298.87s]  Because if you don't stop moving as a Scout, you're going to get in this flow where you can just keep running around in circles killing people over and over again.
[298.87s -> 305.87s]  And when you stop, once you stop moving as a Scout, you start to really think about what you're doing and you get out of the zone.
[305.87s -> 311.50s]  So stay as focused as you can when you play and just don't stop moving.
[311.70s -> 316.87s]  Before I go, I just want to say one more thing. It all takes practice guys and it all takes patience.
[316.87s -> 322.87s]  I was an awful Scout. Like Scout was one of my least played classes when the game first came out.
[322.87s -> 327.87s]  I couldn't do it. I couldn't understand. I have such low health. How am I supposed to do this? This is ridiculous.
[327.87s -> 332.05s]  You just have to play. You just have to play. You just have to get comfortable.
[332.05s -> 336.05s]  And once you do those two things, you will get good no matter what you do.
[336.05s -> 340.22s]  Even if you don't do any of these techniques, you will get good.
[340.42s -> 344.42s]  So just practice and play and just have fun. That's what it's all about guys.
[344.42s -> 349.60s]  So I will see you guys all soon. Hopefully some of you guys could get some information out of this video.
[349.60s -> 351.60s]  And even if you didn't, you just watch for the fun of it.
[351.60s -> 353.60s]  Then thanks for watching. I'll see you all soon.
[353.60s -> 355.60s]  And take care everybody.
