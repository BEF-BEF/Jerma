[0.00s -> 16.62s]  The story you'll hear is heartwarming and charming, although some of you may find it alarming.
[16.62s -> 24.50s]  On a napkin I write some ink and a nail. I'm writing, of course, from the old county jail.
[24.50s -> 32.86s]  Those fuckers got me, as you can plainly see. What do I do now, besides take a pee?
[32.86s -> 40.79s]  Arrested for much I'm about to explain. Sit back and relax while my words entertain.
[40.79s -> 48.26s]  Our story unfolds on a cold Christmas Eve, a two pairs of socks night, if you could believe.
[48.26s -> 54.65s]  The TV was loud and just how I like it. Fodded 30 times, trust me, I counted.
[54.65s -> 62.28s]  What a glorious night, not a care in the world. Nothing could ruin this holiday, this great...
[62.36s -> 69.00s]  I'm having a really good time. Really, I can't think of what rhymes with world for this current situation.
[69.00s -> 77.00s]  So it was just fun. Sipping my tea and eating my crackers, an annoying voice came up through the rafters.
[77.00s -> 82.84s]  It's Christmas Eve, Grandpa. This is not good. There are no gifts from you underneath that hood.
[82.84s -> 88.44s]  Of that beautiful tree that we spent so much time making. I'm not messing around and I am not faking.
[88.44s -> 94.82s]  Get your ass out of that chair and into the snow or Christmas is ruined. Hurry up and go.
[94.82s -> 100.98s]  Jerma sucks. That's all that needs to be said. I really wish he would permanently go to bed.
[100.98s -> 108.52s]  Standing up from my wonderful man station. God damn it, my procrastination. Stores were all closed.
[108.52s -> 114.28s]  Nothing was open. This new found bad news, I was having trouble coping. I had to think fast.
[114.36s -> 121.98s]  There was just no more time. I was all out of options. So it came to a crime.
[121.98s -> 128.54s]  The night came quick and I acted with swiftness. For there's only so much you can steal on Christmas.
[128.54s -> 134.92s]  Out through the door there was no looking back. It was time to rip off a neighborhood ass crack.
[134.92s -> 141.72s]  Down the street I trotted on my imaginary horse. The hallucinatic drugs I took were running their course.
[141.72s -> 148.60s]  Through my body and blood it made things all hazy. This house looks good. But was I going crazy?
[148.60s -> 154.89s]  There was nobody home, not a light in the house. I got off my steed and creeped close like a mouse.
[154.89s -> 160.17s]  Dressed all in black from my head to my toe, I smashed through the front window with a perfect
[160.17s -> 165.54s]  brick throw. Climbing through the clearing I slithered like a snake. No one's home though.
[165.54s -> 170.20s]  I could have been a fucking earthquake. Once inside I went right for the jewelry.
[170.20s -> 176.81s]  Because that's the most expensive. There is no tomfoolery. On my way out I left an IOU.
[176.81s -> 183.61s]  If I ever would pay it. Not sure if that would be true. Into the brisk wind from which I first came,
[183.61s -> 189.93s]  a cruiser was waiting. They were ready to tame. This old man can still run, I shouted and screamed.
[189.93s -> 196.01s]  A sharp pain I felt shooting into my spleen. I was feeling the wrath of over 5,000 volts.
[196.01s -> 202.89s]  My body struck down like a lightning bolt. A taser, really? I'm an old man for Christ's sake.
[202.89s -> 209.29s]  Every single inch of my body did ache. Into the back of the cruiser we rolled through the night.
[209.29s -> 214.89s]  I heard them joke and giggle about my pathetic attempts to fight. I don't blame them though.
[214.89s -> 220.33s]  It was really dumb. Would I take it all back? Was I feeling numb? Do I plead insanity?
[220.33s -> 225.38s]  Shit myself in the backseat? Punch myself in the face and blame it on Wall Street?
[225.38s -> 232.97s]  No. I think not. I'll do my time. I've made the mistakes put forth in this rhyme.
[232.97s -> 240.54s]  Sitting in this cell with much time to think. Not being with the people I love really does stink.
[240.54s -> 248.49s]  So remember this tale this holiday season. Don't do dumb shit. For absolutely no reason.
[248.49s -> 250.09s]  Happy holidays everyone.
