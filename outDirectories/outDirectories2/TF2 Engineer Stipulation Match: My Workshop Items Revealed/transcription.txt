[0.31s -> 16.50s]  Hey, what is happening everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and guys, I'm in a great mood today.
[16.50s -> 20.50s]  It is beautiful outside. You know those days where you just look outside and you say,
[20.50s -> 25.50s]  my god, it is a great world we live in. It's one of those days today, guys.
[25.50s -> 32.50s]  Hopefully you're having a good day too, but this is going to be an Engineer Widowmaker only stipulation match.
[32.50s -> 37.50s]  And I know it's been kind of a long time. It's been maybe a month since that last spy stipulation.
[37.50s -> 42.50s]  And I do apologize, but I've been trying to work on other projects, trying to get a new Enlighten done.
[42.50s -> 49.50s]  And expect that Enlighten in the next probably three or four days. I'm still working on it, trying to get it as good as I can possibly make it.
[49.50s -> 60.50s]  So expect that soon. Now this video, this particular video, as I said, Engineer Widowmaker only, that means no buildings, no pistol, no sentries, no nothing.
[60.50s -> 68.74s]  It's only point and shoot with the Widowmaker. Now that on paper might sound kind of bad, but think about it like this.
[68.74s -> 72.74s]  When you build buildings, you're using metal. When you upgrade buildings, you're using metal.
[72.74s -> 76.74s]  When you do anything with any of your buildings, you're using a substantial amount of metal.
[76.74s -> 84.74s]  This setup allows you to use 100% of your metal and ammo, whatever you want to call it, for shooting people.
[84.74s -> 91.24s]  Now this is not totally recommended that you do this all the time, because obviously this is just a stipulation match.
[91.24s -> 97.24s]  This is not something you should be doing every time you play Engineer, because you would really irritate your team.
[97.24s -> 102.24s]  Your team would just be like, where's the dispensers and the teleporters? What the hell?
[102.24s -> 109.48s]  And you kind of have to defend yourself by going, I don't know. But every now and then it is totally worth doing this.
[109.48s -> 114.66s]  And like I was going to say before, it takes you out of the Engineer mindset. There's no nest you have to protect.
[114.66s -> 119.66s]  There's no dispenser that your teammates are going to need at level 3. You're just a powerhouse Engi.
[119.66s -> 124.66s]  And that can be a problem when you face a couple of different classes, like the Scout or the Heavy.
[124.66s -> 130.66s]  And I say those two things for very good reasons. The Heavy, of course, if you run at a Heavy with a shotgun,
[130.66s -> 133.66s]  I'm going to get you just dead. You're instantly going to die.
[133.66s -> 139.66s]  There's no way a Heavy won't kill you with this setup unless you get behind them or you catch them somehow off guard.
[139.66s -> 141.66s]  That's the only real way that's going to happen.
[141.66s -> 145.83s]  And I say Scout for the second reason, because they're jumping around all over the place,
[145.83s -> 148.83s]  and it can be tough to get those shots on a Scout, especially with the shotgun.
[148.83s -> 153.83s]  And it makes it even worse when you don't have a Mini Sentry backing you up shooting them.
[153.83s -> 160.39s]  So now I want to briefly talk about the stipulation series in general and what I plan on doing with it,
[160.39s -> 167.39s]  where I plan on going, because before this, I tried to get a Sniper, No Scope only, and Jurati,
[167.39s -> 172.39s]  which means I could throw the Jurati on somebody and obviously get the Mini Crits with the No Scope.
[172.39s -> 180.19s]  I tried doing that in so many places. I tried so many times to do that, and it really just wasn't happening.
[180.19s -> 186.37s]  I'm still going to try and get it. I am determined to get that stipulation, because I think it's a really good idea,
[186.37s -> 192.61s]  a really funny idea. And another one somebody sent me a long time ago, Soda Popper and Pistol with the Scout.
[192.61s -> 196.61s]  And I can only use the Pistol to shoot, and I can use the Mini Crits.
[196.61s -> 200.61s]  So bring up the Soda Popper, run around a little bit, get the Mini Crits, switch to the Pistol.
[200.61s -> 202.61s]  I think that's a great idea.
[202.61s -> 207.61s]  But the reason why I'm talking about this right now is because these things are kind of difficult to get good gameplays on.
[207.61s -> 214.78s]  So expect the stipulation series to be maybe once a month now rather than once every week or once every couple weeks,
[214.78s -> 218.15s]  because it is pretty difficult to get some of these gameplays.
[218.15s -> 224.46s]  Speaking of the gameplay, it's coming to a close right now. I think, pretty sure I second frag or top frag.
[224.46s -> 227.70s]  I'm actually not sure. I don't remember, but I know I'm there.
[227.70s -> 231.70s]  So in the title of this video, you're probably looking at it and going,
[231.70s -> 235.70s]  wait, wait, wait, he's revealing something? What's he revealing? He's got an item? He's going to show us the stuff?
[235.70s -> 240.94s]  That is absolutely right. I'm going to finally... I've been talking about it for so long now,
[240.94s -> 246.67s]  but here are the prototype items for the Heavy.
[246.67s -> 252.37s]  As you can see, it is a baby Heavy.
[252.37s -> 255.37s]  So we got the bonnet. We have the diaper.
[255.37s -> 259.37s]  And there's going to be a secret item that this guy, DJ Thed, he's going to be working on.
[259.37s -> 262.37s]  That's the guy who's been doing it. He'll be in the description, his link.
[262.37s -> 266.37s]  He's a really talented guy, really nice guy. And he's actually really young, too.
[266.37s -> 269.37s]  For the talent he shows and for the stuff he's doing, he's a pretty young guy.
[269.37s -> 272.37s]  So it's interesting to see that. Really cool to see that.
[272.37s -> 278.37s]  But here you go. This is the baby diaper heavy thing that I've been talking about for like four months.
[278.37s -> 281.37s]  And so this is my call to you guys.
[281.37s -> 284.85s]  What do you think this set should be called?
[284.85s -> 287.22s]  Should this be called the Big Baby?
[287.22s -> 291.22s]  Should it be called the Fat Heavy Diaper Bastard?
[291.22s -> 293.22s]  I'm leaving it up to you guys.
[293.22s -> 296.22s]  I want to pick the coolest name for this set.
[296.22s -> 301.65s]  So drop that into the comments section of this video and I will pick the best one.
[301.65s -> 304.65s]  And that's what's going to be the name of this set.
[304.65s -> 307.82s]  So it's not on the workshop right now. I really want to state that.
[307.82s -> 311.82s]  This is not on the Steam Workshop right now. These are prototype items.
[311.82s -> 313.82s]  They are not final.
[313.82s -> 318.82s]  So I will give you guys the link so you can finally see the finished versions sometime at a later date.
[318.82s -> 321.82s]  But I had to show you. I couldn't hold it anymore.
[321.82s -> 324.83s]  So this is going to be the end of the video, guys.
[324.83s -> 327.83s]  Thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[327.83s -> 331.25s]  And I'll see you all soon. Take care, everybody.
