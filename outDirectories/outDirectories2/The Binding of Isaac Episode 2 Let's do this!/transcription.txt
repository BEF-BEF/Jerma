[0.31s -> 19.52s]  I got plenty of health. Dog food? HP up. Oh, wow. Okay. I already had pretty much full health anyways, though, didn't I?
[19.52s -> 30.90s]  What's down? What's this? Okay. Um... I... I'm a little concerned right now. I don't know what's going on.
[30.90s -> 36.65s]  Alright, left or right? Left or right? Left.
[36.65s -> 51.63s]  Brimstone. Whoa. Whoa, what? What the hell is this? What is going on? Whoa! Does that hurt me?
[51.63s -> 57.63s]  Oh, I lost a... Okay, should I... I'm just gonna go. I'm not even gonna pretend like I know what's going on.
[57.63s -> 68.38s]  Level 3, the caves. One. Alright. So I'm still this guy. You have to hold it down? This could be pretty deadly.
[68.38s -> 77.40s]  Oh. I don't know if I like this. Yeah, I don't know if I like this. You have to, like, wait before you can shoot?
[77.40s -> 90.51s]  Ah, it's not that bad. Let's keep going. I'd probably miss something in that room. If you, like, destroy the gar girl, you get $5,000.
[90.51s -> 106.81s]  Actually, this is pretty cool. I'm not gonna lie. Oh! Down or right? Let's go down. Oh, what do you know about my super stream beam?
[106.81s -> 116.23s]  What do you know about my super stream? I forgot those bug things are here. What do you know, Cauliflower Boy? You're done.
[116.23s -> 126.81s]  Let's get rid of those. Now, I'm wondering if I... I don't think I can waste this. I'm pretty sure I just have this forever until I die.
[126.81s -> 134.20s]  Which is... Someone just died right there, speaking of death. This is where it gets a little tricky.
[134.20s -> 143.86s]  I'm just gonna stand here. Oh, God. I don't want to die because I don't want to lose this. Get out of here. Get out of here!
[143.86s -> 152.96s]  Get out of here! Get out of here! That was the scariest thing in the world. You can't mess with my fire and brimstone, baby.
[152.96s -> 161.70s]  So, what I was gonna say is I'm wondering if I die... There's no checkpoints in this game, I don't think. There is not.
[161.70s -> 172.01s]  Can I open that? I can. Look at that health. No, I can't. I have temp... No, you know what? Now, screw the boss. I'm not going for the boss right now.
[172.01s -> 180.75s]  That's a bad idea. There could be some hidden secrets that I'm missing that I don't want to miss. Let's go right.
[180.75s -> 187.75s]  I'm gonna charge up my stuff beforehand. Ooh, I don't know how I just didn't get hit by that.
[187.75s -> 196.34s]  Okay, I don't have any keys. Let's just get out of here. I don't have any... I can't get any health.
[196.34s -> 206.23s]  Hopefully, there's something cool over here. Oh, dear God. Oh, my God. I'm gonna die. Oh, my God.
[206.23s -> 215.42s]  Oh, I have to hold the stupid thing down. If I didn't have to hold that down... Now I'm gonna get my ass kicked at the boss.
[215.42s -> 226.57s]  Shit. Die. Actually, there's health on the way. The key. I can open that item door now. That's a good thing.
[226.57s -> 236.67s]  How am I supposed to get that chest? I'm confused. How does one cross that and get the chest?
[236.67s -> 250.55s]  It's probably an item you can get that does it, to be honest. Shit. And here comes the pitch, and it's a home run.
[250.55s -> 258.11s]  I need to be careful here because I will die and lose everything, and then I will want to shoot myself in the face.
[258.11s -> 268.87s]  Pills here. So what? You just hit Q to use the pills? Yeah, come on. Get in a line like that. Just like that. Bang.
[268.87s -> 283.42s]  I can go in here. Okay, so here's the conundrum. Do I go in the room? Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay, we're good. We're good.
[283.42s -> 295.50s]  I get it. I get it. Oh, nothing. You maggot bastards. So the doors... So you get a chest, but... Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[295.50s -> 304.66s]  You have to do it again? Oh, God. If I knew that, I wouldn't have signed up for this deal. Geez. My God.
[304.66s -> 316.17s]  I bet you there's another one, too. I just really royally screwed myself right here. Oh, my God. Jesus. Oh, my God.
[316.17s -> 323.29s]  I don't think that was worth it, even though I didn't lose any health. That was not worth it. Gonna safely say.
[323.29s -> 331.72s]  But I do have a key now, and I can go into that item room. So I'm pretty stoked.
[331.72s -> 344.87s]  The binding of Isaac. Okay, item room. Yeah, item room. It's a guaranteed item. Why the hell wouldn't I do that?
[344.87s -> 357.38s]  Damage up. Blood of the Martyr. I got a lot of items on right now. I am ready to rock. So wherever you are... Oh, he's down there, I remember.
[357.38s -> 366.02s]  I've also got pills. So I'm ready to go to caves, too. And you can take that to the bank, wherever this boss is right here.
[366.02s -> 376.31s]  I got full health. Two hearts. That sucks, but you know, whatever. All right. Isaac versus Fistula. That's not disgusting at all.
[376.31s -> 387.71s]  Oh, don't worry. You're not disgusting. I'm not looking forward to this. Whoa. Oh, my God. Pills. Take the pills.
[387.71s -> 397.77s]  What? What? What is going on? No, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Oh, that was so stupid. Hold on. Don't freak out.
[397.77s -> 408.00s]  You got this. Get the heart. Just get the heart. It's okay. It's right there. Nice. Nice. Okay, that was a minor freak out right there, but I did it.
[408.00s -> 416.14s]  And I got some lipstick. I don't really need range with this thing. It goes across the whole map. All right, let's move on.
[416.14s -> 427.78s]  Move on to the caves, too. Oh, this is gonna be nice. See ya. Can I beat this game? Please tell me I can just beat this game.
[427.78s -> 454.48s]  Please tell me I can just beat this game. TNT. Okay, let's go. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no. No, no, no.
[454.48s -> 464.94s]  God damn. So it turns out that that was not the best thing to do. I will get back up to that part.
