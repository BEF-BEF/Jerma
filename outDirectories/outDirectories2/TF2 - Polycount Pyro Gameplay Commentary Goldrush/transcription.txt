[3.45s -> 13.36s]  Thank you for allowing me to hit people in the face with a pickaxe.
[13.36s -> 17.56s]  Probably recording right now, casual.
[17.56s -> 20.56s]  Indeed I was recording, indeed I was.
[20.56s -> 25.56s]  Hey hey, what is up guys, it's Jerma again with a gameplay commentary.
[25.56s -> 30.56s]  This time I am on Gold Rush defense on Gold Rush playing as the poly count pyro.
[30.56s -> 35.56s]  A lot of people ask for poly count and a lot of people ask me to do pyro gameplays,
[35.56s -> 38.56s]  especially when I did that video asking what you guys wanted to see.
[38.56s -> 41.56s]  A lot of the response was do pyro and do poly count.
[41.56s -> 46.56s]  So I figured, hey, why not kill two birds with one stone and do the poly count pyro.
[46.56s -> 49.56s]  So anyways, this is from the event that I had earlier today.
[49.56s -> 52.56s]  We were on a guy's, I think his name was Dispenser, that was his name.
[52.56s -> 58.56s]  It was his server. He was really concerned because I think there was only like two or three people in the server when we all flooded it.
[58.56s -> 62.56s]  And he was just like, uh, I don't know if my server can handle this.
[62.56s -> 65.86s]  But it did, it did. We had a good time.
[65.86s -> 69.86s]  I got a couple of gameplays from this particular event, but I'm going to just do one commentary today.
[69.86s -> 73.86s]  I'll probably get the other ones done either tomorrow or the next day, something like that.
[73.86s -> 76.86s]  But anyways, let's get into the gameplay.
[76.86s -> 83.86s]  The loadout for this match is going to be the Degreaser, the Flare Gun, and the Power Jack.
[83.86s -> 88.86s]  And watch this Jamps, Jamps is trying to come at me here and he's trying to taunt me with the melee kill.
[88.86s -> 91.86s]  So I say, you know what, whip out the Power Jack and shaboom!
[91.86s -> 95.04s]  Had a little bit of fraps lag there, but you saw what happened.
[95.04s -> 98.04s]  So anyways, he tries that the whole entire time, by the way.
[98.04s -> 102.04s]  It was his goal to try and melee kill me the entire time.
[102.04s -> 105.04s]  And I don't think he did it once, so we'll find out though.
[105.04s -> 108.54s]  I have only watched this gameplay once or twice, so I forget.
[108.54s -> 113.54s]  And I rage switch middle of the match to the shotgun because I can't get used to the Flare Gun.
[113.54s -> 118.54s]  Something about the arc and the drop off and the range and everything like that, I can't get used to.
[118.54s -> 121.54s]  I'm used to just whipping the shotgun out and pumping people full of lead.
[121.54s -> 127.54s]  Right here I'm just trying to massively spray back these rockets and try and get a lucky kill, but I don't.
[127.54s -> 128.54s]  And this is actually really cool.
[128.54s -> 132.54s]  I get this heavy lid on fire and I thought for sure that this was going to be a kill.
[132.54s -> 134.54s]  Boom, launch him in the air and boom, a crit!
[134.54s -> 137.54s]  But no, it doesn't kill him and I die.
[137.54s -> 144.54s]  But I do get an assist from the psycho crazy, not overpowered at all item called the Cow Mangler 5000.
[144.54s -> 149.35s]  And for just a second I would like to talk about the Cow Mangler 5000.
[149.35s -> 156.35s]  I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time on it, but I'm going to explain to you why I am very upset about Valve, what they did and why they did it.
[156.35s -> 159.04s]  Nobody else got any other items.
[159.04s -> 162.04s]  I know that on the forums and all over the place, all over the servers, people were saying,
[162.04s -> 166.04s]  no, no, no, no, no, the Engineer and the Pyro are definitely going to get items.
[166.04s -> 167.04s]  Is somebody else?
[167.04s -> 170.04s]  Why did they just give the Soldier more stuff?
[170.04s -> 174.28s]  The Soldier just got like a million items in the Uber update.
[174.28s -> 177.28s]  Why did they do this?
[177.28s -> 178.28s]  I am so annoyed.
[178.28s -> 180.28s]  And right there, sorry, I had to stop for a second.
[180.28s -> 186.46s]  Jamps was trying to come at me again and somebody just smoked him with the weapon I'm actually talking about.
[186.46s -> 187.89s]  So I don't know, I don't get it.
[187.89s -> 193.06s]  I don't understand why you add into a game something like that when you just gave him something.
[193.06s -> 196.06s]  They must be specifically trying to annoy people.
[196.06s -> 205.06s]  Either that or somebody gave me the idea, they said the Soldier is the most balanced class in the game, that it's really, really easy to give him items.
[205.06s -> 207.06s]  But I don't know.
[207.06s -> 209.06s]  I'm not going to talk about it anymore.
[209.06s -> 210.06s]  You guys already know how I feel about it.
[210.06s -> 214.06s]  But that's stupid that they didn't give anyone else anything, just the Soldier.
[214.06s -> 216.06s]  So now let's get back to the gameplay.
[216.06s -> 220.30s]  Peeking out around this corner, just trying to pick somebody off with one of the flare gun shots.
[220.30s -> 221.30s]  That's a Spy.
[221.30s -> 224.30s]  He gets destroyed by a Demoman's direct shot.
[224.30s -> 228.54s]  Just trying to get a flare gun into the spawn and this Soldier rocket jumps over here.
[228.54s -> 229.54s]  I get him lit on fire.
[229.54s -> 230.54s]  I don't get the kill though.
[230.54s -> 232.54s]  Trying to do that thing like I was doing before to that Heavy.
[232.54s -> 234.54s]  Launch somebody in the air and get him with the crit.
[234.54s -> 238.54s]  It's something I really want to learn how to do, but I just can't.
[238.54s -> 243.72s]  So I try to run away from this Heavy and he gets one little pellet on me before I go in the door.
[243.72s -> 247.72s]  And we're getting pretty close to when I rage switch over to the shotgun.
[247.72s -> 250.72s]  And you'll see how astronomically better I do when I use the shotgun.
[250.72s -> 260.09s]  So that Uber Heavy was a big, big advantage for them because now instead of it being one minute left and they're scrambling to get out of their spawn, they're now pushing to the second point.
[260.09s -> 264.09s]  And here is a great tip as a Pyro at these little choke point areas like this.
[264.09s -> 266.09s]  Look how many people are right here.
[266.09s -> 274.39s]  If I had reflected that rocket, if it didn't hit that Heavy in the back and I reflected it, I could have potentially killed like four people right there.
[274.39s -> 279.57s]  It's a great thing to do as a Pyro is just to suicide, run around a corner and just reflect.
[279.57s -> 283.57s]  And if you get lucky, you will kill everybody that's on the cart.
[283.57s -> 285.94s]  So just trying to get some flares up here.
[285.94s -> 286.94s]  I know there's a Sniper up there.
[286.94s -> 288.94s]  I'm trying just to get him with a little shot here.
[288.94s -> 290.94s]  And here comes Jamps again.
[290.94s -> 293.94s]  When I come around this corner, I kill a Soldier and you'll see.
[293.94s -> 294.94s]  So I get this Soldier.
[294.94s -> 295.94s]  I think it's an Assist.
[295.94s -> 296.94s]  Yeah, it's an Assist.
[296.94s -> 300.94s]  And then, oh, oh, oh, I thought he really was going to get me that time, but he didn't.
[300.94s -> 301.94s]  And I just died.
[301.94s -> 302.94s]  He was pissed about it.
[302.94s -> 304.94s]  He was yelling in the chat about it.
[304.94s -> 305.94s]  So he didn't get me.
[305.94s -> 307.94s]  You didn't get me, Jamps.
[307.94s -> 309.62s]  Not yet.
[309.62s -> 311.62s]  So you saw me just switch over to the shotgun.
[311.62s -> 314.80s]  At this point, I was like not messing around anymore.
[314.80s -> 319.80s]  It was time for me to start to do my duty and get like 10 kills in a row.
[319.80s -> 320.80s]  And it actually works out pretty well.
[320.80s -> 321.80s]  I love this setup.
[321.80s -> 323.80s]  The Degreaser and the Shotgun work well for me.
[323.80s -> 327.80s]  Most of my kills, believe it or not, are not with the Extinguisher.
[327.80s -> 330.80s]  I don't use the Extinguisher really that much.
[330.80s -> 332.80s]  Most of my kills are with the Shotgun.
[332.80s -> 338.30s]  My basic default setup for the Pyro is the Degreaser, the Shotgun,
[338.30s -> 341.30s]  and the Homewrecker, if you would believe.
[341.30s -> 344.30s]  That's my default Pyro setup, even on offense.
[344.30s -> 345.73s]  Offense.
[345.73s -> 346.73s]  I don't like using the Extinguisher.
[346.73s -> 350.73s]  If you've been around since I have my first videos, my first few videos,
[350.73s -> 353.73s]  you saw me try to use the Extinguisher and you probably laughed
[353.73s -> 355.90s]  because I can't use it that good.
[355.90s -> 357.90s]  So I turn this corner and shoot this scout in the face
[357.90s -> 360.90s]  and I know there's a teleporter up there and even though it doesn't really matter,
[360.90s -> 362.90s]  I'm so gung-ho on getting rid of it.
[362.90s -> 363.90s]  It really doesn't matter.
[363.90s -> 365.90s]  I could have killed so many people right here.
[365.90s -> 369.90s]  But no, I'm like, I have to get rid of this teleporter or we're going to lose.
[369.90s -> 372.90s]  But it's only like a 20-foot walk anyways.
[372.90s -> 374.90s]  I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
[374.90s -> 376.90s]  So this is where things get really good.
[376.90s -> 380.90s]  This is where I actually stop being a scrub and I start actually smoking people.
[380.90s -> 383.90s]  So I promise, oh, Spy, how are you?
[383.90s -> 384.90s]  How was your day?
[384.90s -> 385.90s]  Thank you for coming.
[385.90s -> 389.90s]  I promise now you'll get to see some shotgun kills, some good shotgun kills.
[389.90s -> 394.21s]  So me and this medic take a trip down memory lane over here.
[394.21s -> 395.21s]  We go across here.
[395.21s -> 396.21s]  There's a scout that comes down.
[396.21s -> 399.51s]  I pump him full of lead right here.
[399.51s -> 400.51s]  Here he is.
[400.51s -> 401.69s]  Flow him in the air.
[401.69s -> 402.69s]  Bang, you get killed with a shotgun shot.
[402.69s -> 403.69s]  That's one.
[403.69s -> 408.31s]  I got a little pocket medic here, pocket pyro medic, which is kind of funny.
[408.31s -> 409.31s]  We come back down to the same area.
[409.31s -> 410.31s]  I like this guy on fire.
[410.31s -> 411.31s]  He had low health anyways.
[411.31s -> 413.31s]  Don't even need to shoot him with a shotgun.
[413.31s -> 414.31s]  I get Ubered come out here.
[414.31s -> 417.31s]  I'm trying to get this guy over the corner with a few shots.
[417.31s -> 419.31s]  Boom, that's another shotgun kill.
[419.31s -> 421.31s]  And what do you know, reflect a dead, a dead ringer Spy.
[421.31s -> 423.31s]  I think that's what he was, but it doesn't matter.
[423.31s -> 424.31s]  Another shotgun kill right here.
[424.31s -> 426.31s]  That was Jamps again.
[426.31s -> 427.31s]  Come out here.
[427.31s -> 429.31s]  Hey, what's going on, sniper shotgun kill?
[429.31s -> 430.31s]  How you doing?
[430.31s -> 432.62s]  I don't know how I was not lighting this guy on fire.
[432.62s -> 434.62s]  Don't ask me how that was not happening.
[434.62s -> 435.62s]  Runaway time.
[435.62s -> 436.62s]  Here's their whole team.
[436.62s -> 438.62s]  And that's what I'm talking about.
[438.62s -> 439.62s]  That's my normal setup right there.
[439.62s -> 441.62s]  Bada bing, bada boom.
[441.62s -> 443.62s]  I'm not Italian, so don't even ask.
[443.62s -> 445.62s]  I just like saying that.
[445.62s -> 449.50s]  So this pyro just jumps down from heaven.
[449.50s -> 451.50s]  I thought he had no health because he's running away.
[451.50s -> 454.50s]  Turns out he had plenty of health and he gets me one more shot.
[454.50s -> 456.50s]  Would have done it too bad.
[456.50s -> 457.50s]  But you know what?
[457.50s -> 461.50s]  2020 hindsight, the modest Spy can't see health or a medic with a solemn bow.
[462.50s -> 464.50s]  Maybe one day they'll add something for the Pyro.
[464.50s -> 466.50s]  No, I'm not even going to pretend like that's a funny joke.
[466.50s -> 470.49s]  So it's under three minutes and they're getting on the cart here.
[470.49s -> 472.49s]  Just trying to cause a little bit of chaos.
[472.49s -> 474.49s]  I am no match for this heavy, so I jump away.
[474.49s -> 476.49s]  I go around the corner looking for a medic or something like that,
[476.49s -> 478.49s]  but there was not one around.
[478.49s -> 479.49s]  Now I'm covered in Girardi.
[479.49s -> 482.49s]  So just chilling out for a minute, trying to get some health back.
[482.49s -> 485.49s]  And look at that shot by Zack34.
[485.49s -> 487.49s]  I jumped in the air and he got a headshot.
[487.49s -> 488.49s]  It was awesome.
[488.49s -> 489.49s]  Nice job, Zack.
[489.49s -> 494.26s]  So here's another quick Pyro tip for those of you that are new.
[494.26s -> 499.74s]  The Pyro, as a class, is about causing chaos.
[499.74s -> 501.74s]  As I'm right here, watch this, ready?
[501.74s -> 503.74s]  Look at all these people I light on fire.
[503.74s -> 504.74s]  I don't necessarily kill any of them.
[504.74s -> 507.74s]  I get a couple assist kills, but I don't really kill any of them.
[507.74s -> 509.05s]  Don't be misled.
[509.05s -> 513.90s]  Your flamethrower is not meant to kill anyone.
[513.90s -> 516.90s]  The only time you should be concerned about killing somebody with a flamethrower
[516.90s -> 519.14s]  is if you have the backburner.
[519.14s -> 524.14s]  The regular default flamethrower and the degreaser are all about causing chaos
[524.14s -> 528.31s]  and then using your secondary or your melee to finish people off.
[528.31s -> 531.31s]  In that situation, see how I just ran in and kind of just got myself killed?
[531.31s -> 535.31s]  That's what's going to happen to you every single time you try to kill somebody
[535.31s -> 538.31s]  by spraying them or by trying to spray a group.
[538.31s -> 540.31s]  Always pull out your secondary after lighting them on fire,
[540.31s -> 542.31s]  especially if you're using the flare gun.
[542.31s -> 543.31s]  The flare gun crits people.
[543.31s -> 546.31s]  It does 90 damage to anyone that's on fire.
[546.31s -> 549.38s]  Here's another good example of being a good Pyro.
[549.38s -> 551.38s]  Watch what this guy's doing to me.
[551.38s -> 553.38s]  Right mouse button is your friend.
[553.38s -> 554.38s]  Look at this.
[554.38s -> 556.38s]  I can't do anything right now.
[556.38s -> 559.38s]  If you compression blast people, you can send them back flying
[559.38s -> 563.38s]  and they just get so disoriented that they can't do a damn thing.
[563.38s -> 564.62s]  See what I'm doing to this guy?
[564.62s -> 567.62s]  I was just confusing him so much by launching him in the air
[567.62s -> 569.62s]  and taking out my shotgun, shooting him, launching him in the air,
[569.62s -> 571.62s]  and he eventually dies.
[571.62s -> 572.62s]  This is a great kill right here.
[572.62s -> 573.62s]  I pull out the power jack.
[573.62s -> 576.62s]  This is like the second or third power jack kill I get.
[576.62s -> 581.62s]  The power jack, if you kill somebody with it, you just get 75 health.
[581.62s -> 583.62s]  You just instantly will get 75 health.
[583.62s -> 587.62s]  The downside is you take 20% more damage from melee when it's active.
[587.62s -> 589.62s]  Nice shotgun kill there.
[589.62s -> 593.80s]  This heavy medic pair I am no match for, so I go down instantly.
[593.80s -> 595.80s]  And one more little tip I can give you for the Pyro
[595.80s -> 599.98s]  before this gameplay ends is always spy check.
[599.98s -> 600.98s]  Always just spray every now.
[600.98s -> 603.98s]  You don't have to hold the mouse button down and run around in circles,
[603.98s -> 604.98s]  but you'll see what I do.
[604.98s -> 606.98s]  There's a sniper up here that I thought was a spy.
[606.98s -> 607.98s]  Just give us spritz here or there.
[607.98s -> 608.98s]  You'll see.
[608.98s -> 610.28s]  Ready?
[610.28s -> 611.28s]  Just like a whoop.
[611.28s -> 612.28s]  He's not a spy.
[612.28s -> 613.28s]  That's all it takes.
[613.28s -> 614.28s]  See, just little spritzes here and there.
[614.28s -> 616.28s]  You want to make sure that no one's going to get backstabbed
[616.28s -> 618.28s]  because people getting backstabbed is bad,
[618.28s -> 620.28s]  especially if this heavy medic pair got backstabbed.
[620.28s -> 622.28s]  We would not have been able to stuff these guys
[622.28s -> 625.28s]  into their little spawn area back here.
[625.28s -> 626.28s]  And I get Uber to end this gameplay.
[626.28s -> 628.28s]  It's actually pretty funny.
[628.28s -> 629.28s]  Get this heavy.
[629.28s -> 630.28s]  It takes forever.
[630.28s -> 632.28s]  See how long it just took me to kill him with the flamethrower?
[632.28s -> 633.28s]  That's what I was talking about before.
[633.28s -> 635.58s]  So Jamps is trying to get one more.
[635.58s -> 636.58s]  He's trying to get his revenge on me.
[636.58s -> 637.58s]  He's screaming over the mic.
[637.58s -> 639.58s]  And I end up killing him.
[639.58s -> 640.58s]  So sorry, Jamps.
[640.58s -> 641.58s]  You didn't get your revenge.
[641.58s -> 644.02s]  Thank you, everybody, for watching
[644.02s -> 646.02s]  and everybody for participating in the event.
[646.02s -> 649.02s]  They'll be more like these, so keep your eyes open.
[649.02s -> 651.02s]  And top frugen like a boost.
[651.02s -> 653.02s]  It's going to show up here any second here.
