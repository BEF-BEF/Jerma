[0.31s -> 16.03s]  Happy Halloween, you ghouls and ghosts. It's me, Jerma, from the past or the future.
[16.03s -> 22.03s]  Does anybody remember when I did that intro, like a year or two ago, whenever the last Halloween update was? I don't remember.
[22.03s -> 27.03s]  But hey, what's going on everybody? Welcome to the Halloween update for Team Fortress 2. My name is Jerma.
[27.03s -> 31.53s]  This is gonna be a live commentary to show you some of the stuff that's going on, in case you can't download it,
[31.53s -> 35.53s]  or in case you just want to watch it, you know, play out. Man versus man.
[35.53s -> 38.03s]  Gray man, blue man, red man, green man.
[38.03s -> 41.97s]  Oh my god, that looks really, really cool.
[41.97s -> 47.35s]  This is the blue guy's grave. Oh no, that's Redman.
[47.35s -> 52.16s]  Ah, okay, we gotta push Redman. They gotta push Bloomin'.
[52.16s -> 55.59s]  I want to pick up a spell. That's the number one thing I want to do.
[55.59s -> 62.23s]  And then you use your action slot to cast that said spell.
[63.23s -> 70.74s]  And this is on Hightower, which as we all know, Hightower is like impossible to cap anything.
[70.74s -> 82.38s]  I want a spell. I want a goddamn spell. Not now. No. Come here, you.
[89.32s -> 93.12s]  Okay, there's a spell book right there. You see that book right there, guys?
[93.12s -> 96.55s]  If I pick this up and I have that magazine equipped.
[96.55s -> 100.11s]  All right, I got a spell. I'm gonna get it. Look in the lower left.
[100.11s -> 104.61s]  I have no idea what this is, but I'm about to cast it on somebody.
[104.61s -> 111.43s]  What? What is this? What is this like?
[111.43s -> 118.77s]  I can't cast my missiles or whatever the hell. Oh, I was hitting the wrong damn button.
[118.77s -> 122.27s]  All right, so that was a fail, but I rebound my key.
[122.27s -> 126.77s]  And I think this is like a fireball or something. We'll see if we can smash somebody with this.
[126.77s -> 131.38s]  You are a spy.
[131.38s -> 136.39s]  Did you see that? I just threw a fireball at that son of a bitch.
[136.39s -> 141.34s]  All right, good. There's another book right there. Let's try to get this book, too.
[141.34s -> 147.03s]  We're gonna win. And I think it's whoever wins the round, you actually go to hell.
[147.03s -> 152.46s]  And then I don't know what the hell happens there, but I don't know what this does.
[152.46s -> 157.14s]  Whoa. Whoa. All right, I'm shooting like bats.
[157.14s -> 159.64s]  Look at all these books. Look at all these spell books.
[159.64s -> 165.24s]  There's spell books everywhere. What? What the hell is going on?
[165.24s -> 168.74s]  Oh, it was a teleport. That was a teleport. All right, I get it.
[168.74s -> 172.57s]  This is like the stupidest thing.
[172.57s -> 182.41s]  All right, we're in hell. So now what? Is there a blue team?
[182.41s -> 186.91s]  But because we won, see how we won that round, we now get to go. Yeah, there is a blue team.
[186.91s -> 195.86s]  Screw you. I'm invisible. Oh, there's an actual invisibility one.
[195.86s -> 199.91s]  No, get away from me. No, I'm a ghost.
[199.91s -> 203.91s]  You turn into a ghost when you die in hell. That's so stupid. I love it.
[203.91s -> 207.91s]  Boo. Boo. You can fly, I think, too. Yeah, you can.
[207.91s -> 213.10s]  If you tap space, you can fly around.
[213.10s -> 218.46s]  I want to cast fireball at somebody. Come here.
[218.46s -> 222.66s]  Gotcha. Oh, God. I don't know what this means.
[222.66s -> 226.79s]  What's with the skeleton? What's with the skeletons?
[226.79s -> 232.12s]  Dude, what does this do? Did I make it to the super book?
[232.12s -> 235.55s]  What's going on? I don't even know what just happened.
[235.55s -> 240.18s]  What spell is this? I think I got the super book.
[240.18s -> 244.18s]  I don't know what that means, but these skeletons are freaking me out.
[244.18s -> 250.45s]  Looks like I got overhealed. Whoa. What the?
[250.45s -> 255.84s]  What the hell is going on? I'm like a baby skeleton.
[255.84s -> 262.00s]  With like a big head. Wow, dude, are you serious?
[262.00s -> 266.00s]  This is outrageous. I can't even hurt anybody.
[266.00s -> 272.61s]  I'm like third person. I've got hacks on. Those are some pretty good hacks.
[277.92s -> 281.92s]  This is so wacky. This is so wacky. I love it.
[281.92s -> 288.13s]  I love this wacky, wacky crap, man. Come on.
[288.13s -> 292.43s]  What am I going to light? I'm going to light a pyro on fire? That's not going to happen.
[292.43s -> 299.20s]  You get it. I'm good. You get it. I'll be alright, man.
[299.20s -> 307.39s]  I feel like Gandalf. Holy hell. What I'm more shocked of
[307.39s -> 311.39s]  of anything else, really, to be honest with you guys, is people playing the objective
[311.39s -> 316.56s]  on Hightower. This update gave us people
[316.56s -> 320.74s]  playing the objectives on Hightower. That's a shock to me.
[320.74s -> 326.70s]  And I fell off, but I think we're still going to get it. This guy's just casting fireball.
[326.70s -> 338.27s]  Oh yeah, we got it. But how crazy is that? Alright, here we go. Let's go to hell.
[344.24s -> 350.64s]  I don't want to die. I just want to run up here. That's all I want.
[350.64s -> 354.94s]  Don't hurt me, please. Come on. I'm the scout. I've got to be the first one there.
[354.94s -> 361.47s]  This is electrified. Don't hit me. We're supposed to all go up there
[361.47s -> 367.74s]  and be friends, right? Because we're all like Halloween buddies. When do the gates
[367.74s -> 372.56s]  open? The gates are open. Go.
[372.56s -> 381.09s]  Ghosts. So what do you get for this? Like some kind of hat? Or achievement or something?
[381.09s -> 389.78s]  Give me the book. Yeah. Hat out of hell.
[389.78s -> 394.91s]  Alright, so for doing this, we get something. Whoa.
[394.91s -> 399.97s]  Is that? Wow, you can spawn him? Didn't me and Star
[399.97s -> 403.97s]  like do this already? Oh my god.
[403.97s -> 408.34s]  Kill this guy. Kill this guy for me.
[408.34s -> 412.83s]  These are both ours. I'm just going to stand right here and be completely
[412.83s -> 418.53s]  protected. Holy crap. That's insane. Alright, well
[418.53s -> 423.82s]  as you can see, it's pretty fun. Pretty amazing.
[423.82s -> 427.82s]  But that's going to wrap it up here, guys. See you all soon. Thanks so much for watching. Go enjoy the update. Go play it.
[427.82s -> 432.00s]  I'm sure we'll all find out more stuff over the next few days. And I'll see you guys all next time.
[432.00s -> 436.24s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
