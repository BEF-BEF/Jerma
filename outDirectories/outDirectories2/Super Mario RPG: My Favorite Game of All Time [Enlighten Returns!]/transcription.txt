[0.31s -> 13.20s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here. Welcome to Enlighten.
[13.20s -> 19.70s]  It's been a very long time. For those of you that subscribe to this channel because of my first couple episodes of this,
[19.70s -> 25.20s]  I deeply apologize that it's taken this long to get another video of Enlighten up.
[25.20s -> 28.20s]  But it's back, it's here, it's gonna be every other Wednesday.
[28.20s -> 32.20s]  And we're going to start, well we're not really starting, I've started this a long time ago.
[32.70s -> 40.94s]  We're going to continue this series with arguably my favorite game ever made in the creation of all video games of all time.
[40.94s -> 47.94s]  I know I've said that probably about a couple other games, but there's really a top 3 or a top 5 when it comes to my favorite games ever made.
[47.94s -> 51.94s]  And this is definitely one of them, Super Mario RPG.
[51.94s -> 59.50s]  And because it's taken me this long to make a new video on this, a lot of you guys probably have no idea what this series is.
[59.50s -> 62.00s]  So in 10 seconds or less, I'm going to explain this.
[62.00s -> 66.00s]  Enlighten is a series where I break down an old game.
[66.00s -> 69.00s]  And one of my favorite old games, I guess it doesn't really have to be one of my favorites,
[69.00s -> 75.00s]  but one that I used to play when I was younger, and I explain exactly why I'm in love with this game.
[75.00s -> 77.00s]  With that being said, we're going to get started.
[77.00s -> 84.26s]  Super Mario RPG Legend of the Seven Stars.
[84.26s -> 90.76s]  So like in typical Mario fashion, the game opens with the Princess being abducted by Bowser and being hauled off to his castle.
[90.76s -> 94.76s]  You go on an immediate quest to save the Princess, call Bowser an asshole, and blah, blah, blah.
[94.76s -> 96.76s]  You know, every Mario game ever made.
[96.76s -> 98.26s]  That's the first five minutes.
[98.26s -> 100.76s]  And then the game goes completely bonkers.
[100.76s -> 104.76s]  A giant Pringles Man sword crashes through the castle, destroying everything inside,
[104.76s -> 108.76s]  leaving you, Bowser, and the Princess to fend for yourselves and escaping.
[108.76s -> 115.06s]  Turns out that sword was a real pain in the balls for the entire world, because he broke through the Star Road.
[115.06s -> 118.06s]  If you don't know what the Star Road is, it's in pretty much all the Mario games.
[118.06s -> 123.06s]  And they actually go into much more detail with what the hell the Star Road even is in this game.
[123.06s -> 128.06s]  And you learn, after playing for a while, that the Star Road is kind of this middle ground for people's wishes,
[128.06s -> 132.06s]  and without it, no wishes will ever come true again.
[132.06s -> 139.07s]  So of course, as Mario, you have to do all the dirty work, because you can jump real high.
[139.07s -> 141.07s]  Never understood that, by the way.
[141.07s -> 143.07s]  Why does Mario have to do everything?
[143.07s -> 146.57s]  He's like the savior of the world, because he can jump higher than Michael Jordan.
[146.57s -> 149.07s]  Like, why is that a thing? Whatever, we're going off track here.
[149.07s -> 153.81s]  Repairing the Star Road becomes the main plot line of this game.
[153.81s -> 160.31s]  You are aided in this by a bunch of different characters that were specifically developed for this game.
[160.31s -> 164.81s]  And I'm about to go off on a complete and total rant right here about a couple of these characters,
[164.81s -> 166.81s]  because here we go.
[166.81s -> 168.81s]  Squaresoft developed this game, correct?
[168.81s -> 171.31s]  Squaresoft are the guys that made the game, they made everything.
[171.31s -> 177.81s]  They created a couple of amazing characters that were never used again in any other Mario game.
[177.81s -> 180.81s]  The main one I'm talking about here is Gino.
[180.81s -> 183.31s]  Gino is your guide of sorts.
[183.31s -> 186.31s]  He's the one that fell from the Star Road, he didn't fall from the Star Road.
[186.31s -> 192.31s]  He's a star that comes down and takes control of a wooden doll's body, and has superpowers.
[192.31s -> 198.81s]  He can shoot friggin' laser beams from his arms, he can shoot rockets out of his hands, and bullets out of his elbows.
[198.81s -> 202.31s]  Why would Nintendo not put this guy in a different game?
[202.31s -> 208.31s]  This guy is way more interesting than Yoshi's, like, pink, blue, and orange cousins.
[208.31s -> 210.31s]  Like, who cares about those bastards?
[210.31s -> 211.31s]  Okay, I'm getting pissed.
[211.31s -> 215.31s]  But anyways, Squaresoft owns the rights to these characters, apparently.
[215.31s -> 218.31s]  This guy Gino, the character Malo, the character Kroko,
[218.31s -> 222.31s]  all these amazing, awesome characters that were developed for this game,
[222.31s -> 225.81s]  and they were never seen again, they were lost in hell.
[225.81s -> 229.31s]  Actually, Gino appeared in one other Game Boy Advance game,
[229.31s -> 232.81s]  but I could go off on that for a thousand years.
[232.81s -> 236.81s]  So anyways, we'll move on from that now, that was a complete rant, completely off-topic.
[236.81s -> 242.26s]  Let's go into the gameplay.
[242.26s -> 244.76s]  So the gameplay is like many other RPGs of the time.
[244.76s -> 249.26s]  You take turns selecting moves and abilities, attack the people, and the people die.
[249.26s -> 251.26s]  You get experience, which levels you up,
[251.26s -> 255.26s]  and there are many items and armor pieces throughout the game to improve your character.
[255.26s -> 257.76s]  The game also introduced something called Timed Hits,
[257.76s -> 262.76s]  and Timed Hits became something that a lot of other RPGs would later refine
[262.76s -> 265.76s]  to try to make RPGs less boring,
[265.76s -> 267.76s]  because of course, they were just back and forth,
[267.76s -> 271.76s]  ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, for quite a while before this game.
[271.76s -> 275.76s]  And essentially what it was, it was just you selected a move, you did the action,
[275.76s -> 277.76s]  and when you got to a certain part of the animation,
[277.76s -> 281.76s]  you would click the button again, and it would do a stronger attack,
[281.76s -> 284.76s]  or in reverse on defense, it would do stronger defense.
[284.76s -> 287.76s]  You kind of put your hands up, and you block the move they were throwing at you.
[287.76s -> 291.51s]  One more key thing about the gameplay that's really interesting to note,
[291.51s -> 298.01s]  this was the only Mario game in existence that ever allowed the player to control Bowser.
[298.01s -> 302.01s]  Bowser actually joins your party at about the midway point in the game.
[302.01s -> 305.01s]  He's pretty emo throughout the whole game, by the way.
[305.01s -> 308.01s]  He cries a lot. I don't know why he's crying,
[308.01s -> 310.01s]  but Bowser is a playable character.
[310.01s -> 313.01s]  One of the cooler parts of this game, having him in your party.
[313.01s -> 315.51s]  Princess Peach is also a party member as well,
[315.51s -> 319.01s]  so having the three of them lined up in the three-party system
[319.01s -> 321.01s]  is pretty entertaining, to say the least.
[321.01s -> 324.38s]  But now we're going to talk about the fun factor of this game,
[324.38s -> 327.38s]  and the reason why I am so in love with it,
[327.38s -> 329.38s]  and it's actually a pretty personal story.
[329.38s -> 333.85s]  So the reason why I love this game so much,
[333.85s -> 336.35s]  and the reason why it's one of my favorite games of all time,
[336.35s -> 338.85s]  is mainly because when this game came out,
[338.85s -> 342.35s]  it was a pretty rough patch of my childhood.
[342.35s -> 344.85s]  I was having a lot of issues at school,
[344.85s -> 348.85s]  I was almost failing every single class at one point,
[348.85s -> 351.35s]  when I was in like the 8th grade, I think, or the 7th grade.
[351.35s -> 355.35s]  Whatever it was, my like 8th grade through like 10th grade,
[355.35s -> 357.35s]  or 11th or 12th or something,
[357.35s -> 359.85s]  it was just about when I became a junior in high school.
[359.85s -> 361.85s]  I was having a lot of issues in school.
[361.85s -> 364.85s]  I mean, I was little, I would get bullied by people,
[364.85s -> 367.35s]  I wasn't the smartest kid in the class,
[367.35s -> 370.35s]  it was a lot of things depressing me when I was younger.
[370.35s -> 374.09s]  And the character specifically, Geno, that I talked about before,
[374.09s -> 377.59s]  contributed to a lot of my loving of this game,
[377.59s -> 381.09s]  and specifically because he was a small character,
[381.09s -> 385.09s]  he was a little wooden doll that got possessed by this greater power,
[385.09s -> 387.59s]  and he had such a large destiny,
[387.59s -> 393.09s]  and the ending of the game is just so uplifting and so sad at the same time.
[393.09s -> 399.09s]  There was a lot of reasons why this game pretty much helped me through my childhood,
[399.09s -> 402.09s]  and I will never lose this game from my brain ever.
[402.09s -> 406.26s]  I'll probably be 80 or 90 years old on my deathbed,
[406.26s -> 408.26s]  and I will be looking at the ceiling,
[408.26s -> 411.26s]  and I'll just be thinking, man, I remember that game Mario RPG,
[411.26s -> 412.76s]  that really was a great game,
[412.76s -> 415.26s]  and it helped me through when I was a depressed little kid.
[415.26s -> 417.26s]  That's gonna happen, that really will happen,
[417.26s -> 418.76s]  because it happens now,
[418.76s -> 422.26s]  and it brings me to the last point I want to make about games,
[422.26s -> 424.00s]  and especially this one.
[424.00s -> 426.50s]  Everybody has a connection with a certain game.
[426.50s -> 430.50s]  Everybody has a certain feeling they get when they play a certain game,
[431.50s -> 434.81s]  and most of them for me are gonna be pretty old,
[434.81s -> 437.81s]  because I'm a lot older, I'm 27 years old,
[437.81s -> 441.81s]  so most of my comfort games, I guess you can put that in quotes,
[441.81s -> 444.31s]  are back when I was 14, 15, 16,
[444.31s -> 446.81s]  and a lot of you guys are at that age right now,
[446.81s -> 449.81s]  and you probably have that game you're playing right now
[449.81s -> 451.81s]  that you will keep in your head forever.
[451.81s -> 454.81s]  So as the video ends here, as we end on Mario RPG,
[454.81s -> 456.55s]  and we talk about some things,
[456.55s -> 460.05s]  it's really a shame that Square and Nintendo
[460.05s -> 462.05s]  really lost touch after this,
[462.05s -> 468.05s]  and Paper Mario was actually supposed to be Mario RPG 2,
[468.05s -> 472.05s]  but it was right at that point when Sony came into the picture,
[472.05s -> 474.55s]  and N64 came into the picture,
[474.55s -> 477.55s]  and Square and Nintendo started to absolutely despise each other,
[477.55s -> 479.05s]  and it never happened,
[479.05s -> 483.05s]  and that's why my gut sinks whenever I think about this,
[483.05s -> 486.11s]  because of these things I talked about previously.
[486.11s -> 488.11s]  But to wrap the video, to close the video,
[488.11s -> 492.61s]  I do want to say that Mario RPG is a fantastic game.
[492.61s -> 495.61s]  It's one of those games that if you have not experienced it,
[495.61s -> 497.61s]  you have to experience it.
[497.61s -> 501.11s]  You have to play this game by any means necessary
[501.11s -> 503.61s]  if you are a big gamer.
[503.61s -> 506.11s]  It's something that has its place in history,
[506.11s -> 509.11s]  has its place in controversy as well.
[509.11s -> 512.61s]  This is not, you know, peaches and cream type game.
[512.61s -> 515.61s]  There was a lot of problems after the release of this,
[515.61s -> 517.61s]  with, like I said, Nintendo and Sony,
[517.61s -> 519.11s]  but it has to be experienced, guys.
[519.11s -> 522.11s]  It is one of the best games I've ever played in my entire life,
[522.11s -> 524.61s]  and hopefully this has enlightened you.
[524.61s -> 527.48s]  You like that little outro? Sick.
[527.48s -> 529.48s]  Anyways, guys, I'll see you all next time.
[529.48s -> 531.48s]  Thank you so much for watching, I really do appreciate it,
[531.48s -> 532.98s]  and I'll see you all next time.
[532.98s -> 535.65s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
