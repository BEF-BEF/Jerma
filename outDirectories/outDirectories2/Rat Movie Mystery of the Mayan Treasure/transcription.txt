[0.31s -> 13.75s]  Rats, we're rats, we're the rats. We pray at night, we stalk at night, we're the rats.
[13.75s -> 22.75s]  I'm the giant rat that makes all of the rules. Let's see what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into.
[22.75s -> 28.08s]  So sue me for being thorough. I want to know that you know what the plan is.
[28.08s -> 34.08s]  Look, seriously mate, how many artifacts do we need to steal before you trust me with these jobs?
[34.08s -> 39.08s]  Well, I just want to make sure you know what's happening. We're going to get the treasure, we're going to get out of there.
[39.08s -> 41.08s]  And we also have to...
[42.08s -> 47.08s]  We must get it. That's the most important thing. So be on your A-game. We go now.
[47.08s -> 51.28s]  I got to drive the car today because it's my birthday.
[51.28s -> 53.28s]  No, don't let him get in the car. Please don't let him.
[53.28s -> 54.28s]  Come on.
[54.28s -> 55.28s]  He's driving. Whatever.
[55.28s -> 56.28s]  Bloody hell.
[56.28s -> 60.28s]  Oi, more importantly, since when did we have a rat problem?
[60.28s -> 63.10s]  We don't. Get in.
[63.10s -> 65.10s]  Let's go. Speed it up.
[65.10s -> 69.10s]  Yeah, that's the speed I'm looking for. That's the type of fastness I want.
[71.81s -> 74.81s]  I don't even know where you're going at this point. We've been driving all night.
[74.81s -> 75.81s]  It's my birthday.
[75.81s -> 80.05s]  Hey, you... You're just... You're running over a guy right now.
[80.05s -> 82.42s]  Are you fucking serious?
[82.42s -> 87.45s]  I mean, next time we do this, I'll get my nan to drive.
[92.59s -> 97.59s]  Excuse me, sir. Yeah, you over the dancing. It's actually $10 to dance in this building. You're going to have to give me some...
[97.59s -> 99.59s]  Oh, I'm going to die!
[99.59s -> 103.59s]  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, may I have the attention of the class?
[103.59s -> 108.59s]  My name is Dick Dastardly Richard, and I'm here to take the treasure chest that's in the back room.
[108.59s -> 111.59s]  Go get it, boys. I'll follow you in.
[111.59s -> 119.59s]  And let me tell you something, clerk. If you so as move a muscle, I'll make sure you stay buried in that ground there.
[119.59s -> 127.08s]  Alright, let's go.
[127.08s -> 130.08s]  Alright, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme. Is the treasure in there? Is it in there?
[130.08s -> 132.08s]  Yep. It's all here.
[132.08s -> 137.08s]  Oh, yes. Now that's what I like to hear. And now we are invincible.
[137.08s -> 139.08s]  Not so fast.
[139.08s -> 147.08s]  You stand before Gerard, guardian of the treasure chest of the Mayan temple, and I will make sure to grab...
[147.08s -> 148.08s]  Hey.
[148.08s -> 149.08s]  Oh, fuck this. I'm off.
[149.08s -> 152.08s]  Hey, what are you doing?
[152.08s -> 158.08s]  We're the rats. We pray at night, we stalk at night. We're the rats.
[158.08s -> 163.08s]  Alright, yeah, that's cool. I like rats, nothing bad with rats, but let me tell you something.
[163.08s -> 166.08s]  Over my dead body are you getting this treasure.
[166.08s -> 170.08s]  Rats, rats, rats, rats, rats, rats.
[170.08s -> 175.08s]  Wow, look at that flock of birds over there. That reminds me of my favorite movie, The Movie.
[175.08s -> 177.08s]  That's your favorite movie, too, right?
[177.08s -> 182.08s]  No, my favorite movie is Frozen. I like Elsa and Anna. Okay, now I kill you.
[182.08s -> 186.42s]  I'd kill you.
[186.42s -> 189.90s]  Wow, that's great pick choice for a favorite of this movie.
[189.90s -> 192.62s]  I wonder if I have to think that now.
[192.62s -> 194.26s]  Now I get to be the giant rat.
[194.26s -> 196.63s]  Cool, surprise.
[196.63s -> 198.83s]  So you're trying to tell me that inside of this building
[198.83s -> 200.83s]  right here, there is a giant rat,
[200.83s -> 202.81s]  among other things, the giant pickles.
[202.81s -> 203.99s]  Did he say pickles?
[203.99s -> 205.83s]  Or am I putting that in there by myself?
[205.83s -> 207.83s]  Whatever, Sergeant Pickles is gonna go in here
[207.83s -> 208.67s]  and check it out.
[208.67s -> 209.91s]  We're gonna make sure everything's okay.
[209.91s -> 211.55s]  And give me some candy corn, too.
[211.55s -> 213.83s]  That's a weird request, I know, but just get it.
[213.83s -> 214.95s]  You guys are gonna drop it.
[214.95s -> 216.31s]  We're gonna be in big trouble.
[216.31s -> 217.55s]  So quit blushing around.
[217.55s -> 218.39s]  I hear somebody coming.
[218.39s -> 219.39s]  Somebody put it down, put it down.
[219.39s -> 220.23s]  Hey, get in.
[221.77s -> 222.77s]  Hello, sir.
[222.77s -> 224.29s]  Welcome to the Rat Cafe.
[224.29s -> 225.85s]  There's no rats here.
[225.85s -> 227.93s]  It's just hamburgers.
[227.93s -> 230.61s]  That would be real nice if that were true.
[230.61s -> 232.05s]  Except it isn't.
[232.05s -> 234.95s]  You're a rat, aren't you?
[234.95s -> 236.39s]  No, no, why would that happen?
[236.39s -> 237.23s]  That's not us.
[237.23s -> 238.99s]  We're just, we're just people.
[238.99s -> 241.03s]  And I'm gonna be taking you in.
[241.03s -> 243.35s]  And wouldn't it be funny if this were real?
[243.35s -> 244.47s]  I'm just kidding.
[244.47s -> 245.29s]  Be careful though.
[245.29s -> 247.51s]  There's apparently a giant rat around.
[247.51s -> 252.09s]  You have a good day, officer.
[252.09s -> 254.25s]  So, you figure anything out in there?
[254.25s -> 255.89s]  Nice, clean.
[255.89s -> 257.77s]  It's back to the drawing board.
[257.77s -> 258.77s]  Well, that's great.
[258.77s -> 259.73s]  I don't know how to draw,
[259.73s -> 272.67s]  so you're gonna have to do the drawing.
[272.67s -> 276.47s]  Sergeant Scritchy Scratch of the Cat Police reporting in.
[276.47s -> 278.15s]  You are now relieved of your duty.
[278.15s -> 278.99s]  Absolutely, Sergeant.
[278.99s -> 279.83s]  You've got it.
[279.83s -> 281.35s]  We'll be taking off now.
[281.35s -> 283.19s]  Thank you for your continued work.
[283.19s -> 284.03s]  Thank you.
[284.03s -> 287.30s]  Your duty will not go unnoticed.
[287.30s -> 288.50s]  What's that on you?
[288.50s -> 289.34s]  What?
[289.34s -> 290.94s]  Are you wearing a rat on your shoulder?
[290.94s -> 292.10s]  Why would I be wearing?
[292.10s -> 292.94s]  What the fuck?
[292.94s -> 293.76s]  Get in there.
[293.76s -> 294.60s]  They're gonna just...
[294.60s -> 296.14s]  Boss, we got big problems.
[296.14s -> 297.50s]  The Cat Police are here.
[297.50s -> 299.38s]  Are you kidding me right now, Cat Police?
[299.38s -> 300.66s]  Get us the fuck out of here.
[300.66s -> 301.50s]  Drive the car.
[301.50s -> 302.34s]  Get us out.
[302.34s -> 303.70s]  Let's speed it up.
[303.70s -> 305.02s]  Get us the fuck out of here.
[305.02s -> 306.62s]  Come on, get us the Cat Police.
[306.62s -> 308.02s]  You kids, don't leave.
[308.02s -> 308.86s]  I'm the police.
[308.86s -> 309.70s]  I'm the police.
[309.70s -> 310.54s]  I'm the police.
[310.54s -> 311.38s]  I'm the police.
[311.38s -> 312.82s]  I'm the police.
[312.82s -> 313.66s]  I'm the police.
[313.66s -> 314.92s]  Good job, Cat Police.
[314.92s -> 315.76s]  You did it again.
[315.76s -> 317.16s]  You saved the world.
[317.16s -> 319.56s]  And that's what we do as Cat Police.
[319.56s -> 321.16s]  We make the world a better...
