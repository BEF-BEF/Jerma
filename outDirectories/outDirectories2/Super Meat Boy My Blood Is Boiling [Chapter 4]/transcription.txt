[0.31s -> 13.95s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Super Meat Boy.
[13.95s -> 17.63s]  Gonna be playing on Chapter 4 tonight, Hell.
[17.63s -> 19.80s]  Which is scary.
[19.80s -> 23.80s]  I don't want to go to Hell. Nobody wants to go to Hell. Why do we have to go to Hell?
[23.80s -> 27.24s]  I am just gonna skip this cutscene. Just kidding.
[27.24s -> 34.67s]  Let's see what happens here. Meat Boy and Dr. Fetus are running at each other with crazy anime backgrounds all over the place.
[35.41s -> 40.71s]  Oh, a clash of the titans indeed.
[40.71s -> 45.45s]  Meat Boy is down. He's gonna get thrown. Oh no, Meat Boy is down for the count.
[45.45s -> 47.88s]  Oh, he's dead.
[47.88s -> 52.38s]  I don't think that's actually true. I think he's alive and well in Hell.
[52.38s -> 56.38s]  That was a rhyme. Don't know why I'm rhyming. I'm kind of crazy right now. I'm drinking a bunch of coffee.
[56.38s -> 64.64s]  So let's just go. Chapter 1. Well, yeah, Chapter 4, Episode 1. I don't even know what you'd call this, but let's just go. Boom!
[65.14s -> 69.38s]  Now, this is notoriously hard, Chapter... That's not where I'm supposed to go.
[69.38s -> 72.56s]  Chapter 4 is very difficult, so I'm hoping... Oh God.
[72.56s -> 75.56s]  I'm hoping I can just smoke through a lot of this.
[75.56s -> 79.12s]  But you know, Super Meat Boy, it is not an easy game.
[85.82s -> 87.82s]  Just by the skin of my teeth.
[87.82s -> 92.76s]  Just by the skin of my teeth, I'm gonna jump, jump, jump, jump.
[92.76s -> 95.90s]  Gotta be careful, gotta be careful.
[96.40s -> 99.40s]  I tried to jump off of it.
[99.40s -> 103.42s]  What the hell?
[103.42s -> 106.42s]  I didn't want to grab onto the damn edge there.
[106.42s -> 108.42s]  What just killed me?
[108.42s -> 111.17s]  I sandwiched myself against that wall.
[111.17s -> 115.76s]  That's fine.
[118.45s -> 120.45s]  Just barely. Holy crap.
[120.45s -> 123.14s]  Oh my God, my life.
[123.14s -> 127.27s]  This is where it's gonna get really hard.
[127.27s -> 131.75s]  This might be a freaking 50 minute episode.
[132.81s -> 137.59s]  I hope not. My sanity will be lost by then.
[137.59s -> 139.47s]  Just go!
[139.47s -> 142.35s]  Wait for it, wait for it.
[148.47s -> 150.47s]  It's right here! Oh, he took me!
[150.47s -> 153.54s]  I wanted my bacon.
[158.54s -> 160.97s]  Oh, I'm good here.
[160.97s -> 162.21s]  Maybe not.
[168.32s -> 169.32s]  The worst part...
[170.12s -> 174.12s]  The worst part about hell is the fact that a lot of these levels take patience.
[174.12s -> 180.12s]  You can't just speed through them, because sometimes you have to wait for stuff like these fireballs of doom.
[180.12s -> 183.49s]  And of course, these things.
[187.66s -> 190.11s]  Sweet.
[190.11s -> 193.11s]  But I'm not a patient guy, as I'm sure a lot of you are aware of by now.
[193.11s -> 194.11s]  Oh, hi!
[194.11s -> 196.99s]  A lot of you guys are probably aware of that.
[196.99s -> 198.99s]  That I am not a patient one.
[198.99s -> 202.81s]  I need to just go, and if I lose, I lose.
[202.81s -> 205.62s]  Alright, gotta be smart here.
[205.62s -> 207.62s]  Jump at the same time.
[207.62s -> 210.05s]  Hello, Suzy.
[210.05s -> 213.21s]  Leviathan.
[215.58s -> 217.45s]  I could have guessed that was gonna happen.
[217.45s -> 218.88s]  Wait for it.
[218.88s -> 220.89s]  Go!
[220.89s -> 222.39s]  Oh, I just overjumped it.
[222.39s -> 227.06s]  I overshot that by a lot.
[227.06s -> 230.14s]  Go! Just go!
[230.14s -> 233.41s]  Do I dare get this damn bandaid?
[233.41s -> 235.90s]  No, there's no way I'll get it.
[235.90s -> 236.90s]  I'm going for it anyways.
[236.90s -> 238.90s]  Stupid! No, stupid!
[238.90s -> 241.58s]  Go, get it. I'm gonna get it.
[242.44s -> 243.44s]  Get it!
[243.44s -> 245.44s]  Don't get it! Just forget it, go!
[246.12s -> 248.74s]  Oh, god damn it!
[252.56s -> 256.59s]  Jeez Louise.
[256.59s -> 259.09s]  It's so addicting to try and get these things.
[259.09s -> 260.77s]  I got it!
[260.77s -> 263.08s]  Just go!
[263.08s -> 267.29s]  I'm gonna get it. I have to get it.
[267.29s -> 270.24s]  I refuse to not get this bandaid.
[270.24s -> 272.24s]  Oh my dear god!
[272.24s -> 277.24s]  I'm going to shoot myself with a BB gun in my bum.
[277.24s -> 279.11s]  That's not very pleasant.
[279.11s -> 281.94s]  Time to end the level.
[281.94s -> 285.44s]  I'm getting to that point where the heat's turning up in my brain.
[285.44s -> 289.04s]  I'm gonna start to scream.
[289.04s -> 291.04s]  Just go. I'm not gonna do this anymore.
[291.04s -> 293.98s]  Let's just end the damn thing.
[293.98s -> 295.67s]  Rickets.
[295.67s -> 298.98s]  Oh, this place really, really sucks.
[302.03s -> 304.04s]  No!
[304.04s -> 306.29s]  You have to go like this.
[306.29s -> 308.55s]  Like that.
[308.55s -> 311.39s]  No!
[311.39s -> 313.20s]  Come on.
[313.20s -> 316.86s]  I don't got all day here.
[316.86s -> 317.86s]  Here we are.
[317.86s -> 319.60s]  Slide down.
[324.10s -> 325.60s]  I almost just jumped over her.
[325.60s -> 327.10s]  How did I get an A plus right there?
[327.10s -> 330.38s]  That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
[330.38s -> 331.38s]  Just move it.
[331.38s -> 332.38s]  And shake it.
[332.38s -> 333.38s]  And move it.
[333.38s -> 334.38s]  And move it.
[334.38s -> 335.38s]  And...
[338.48s -> 339.98s]  Not cool, Meat Boy.
[339.98s -> 340.98s]  Not cool.
[340.98s -> 346.98s]  I thought that was gonna move up higher.
[346.98s -> 347.48s]  Jump.
[347.48s -> 348.48s]  Wait.
[350.48s -> 354.70s]  I'm gonna burp in Meat Boy's face right now.
[356.39s -> 359.73s]  Crap.
[360.73s -> 362.73s]  Slow down. Slow down here.
[362.73s -> 364.73s]  What do these things do?
[367.73s -> 370.00s]  Just go.
[370.00s -> 371.50s]  Speed. It's all about the speed.
[371.50s -> 373.50s]  It's all about moving as fast as you freaking can.
[373.50s -> 376.19s]  What am I doing wrong here?
[376.19s -> 378.38s]  I need to get out there quick.
[378.38s -> 383.95s]  How am I supposed to...
[383.95s -> 385.45s]  I think you have to go like that.
[385.45s -> 386.95s]  Yeah, okay. I get it. I get it.
[386.95s -> 389.51s]  I'm just being a real stupid idiot.
[389.51s -> 394.37s]  No. No! No! No!
[394.37s -> 397.71s]  I'm gonna scream.
[397.71s -> 399.21s]  I'm going to scream.
[399.21s -> 402.74s]  I didn't do it fast enough.
[402.74s -> 405.30s]  Oh my god.
[405.30s -> 406.80s]  Can't wait to watch this one back.
[406.80s -> 407.80s]  Holy crap.
[407.80s -> 411.01s]  There we go.
[411.01s -> 414.12s]  Get. Me. Out of here.
[414.12s -> 415.12s]  No!
[419.83s -> 424.06s]  This is where the tears start flowing.
[424.06s -> 429.22s]  Oh my god. I'm going to throw up.
[429.22s -> 431.21s]  This is gonna be the one right here.
[431.21s -> 432.21s]  I'm just gonna go over it.
[432.21s -> 432.71s]  Wait.
[432.71s -> 433.21s]  Jump.
[433.21s -> 433.71s]  Wait.
[433.71s -> 434.71s]  Jump.
[434.71s -> 435.71s]  Jump over it.
[435.71s -> 437.71s]  And then, get over here!
[437.71s -> 440.66s]  Okay, let's watch this.
[440.66s -> 441.66s]  Everybody...
[441.66s -> 445.34s]  Oh my god. Look at that centipede of Meat Boys.
[445.34s -> 446.34s]  I want to...
[446.34s -> 447.34s]  Yeah.
[447.34s -> 450.34s]  40 to 50% all died on that first little thing.
[450.34s -> 454.30s]  Well, that's one way to do it.
[454.30s -> 455.30s]  Let's continue here.
[455.30s -> 458.44s]  The Deceiver.
[458.44s -> 459.44s]  Oh, that's right.
[459.44s -> 461.44s]  You have to just jump through like this.
[461.44s -> 462.94s]  And then, go like that.
[462.94s -> 464.62s]  And then, go like that.
[464.62s -> 469.78s]  Oh, that wall just screwed me over.
[469.78s -> 470.78s]  Can I get that bandaid?
[470.78s -> 472.78s]  If you have to fall into it like that.
[472.78s -> 474.78s]  If I remember correctly, what should I do?
[474.78s -> 476.34s]  I got it.
[476.34s -> 479.18s]  Let's go.
[479.18s -> 480.18s]  Just be safe here.
[480.18s -> 481.18s]  Don't do anything crazy.
[481.18s -> 482.68s]  You need that bandaid.
[482.68s -> 487.11s]  And this one is like this.
[487.11s -> 488.61s]  Get the key.
[488.61s -> 490.11s]  Get the key.
[490.11s -> 492.94s]  Gotta fall down.
[492.94s -> 498.90s]  Patience is a virtue.
[498.90s -> 500.83s]  I hate this part.
[500.83s -> 502.01s]  Whoa.
[502.01s -> 503.25s]  Wow.
[503.25s -> 504.25s]  Oh, wow.
[504.25s -> 506.00s]  Christopher Walken.
[506.00s -> 507.00s]  That's who I...
[507.00s -> 509.26s]  It's Alan...
[509.26s -> 512.76s]  Too busy doing like a bad Christopher Walken impression to play this game.
[512.76s -> 515.27s]  No, just fall down it.
[515.27s -> 516.51s]  Yeah.
[516.51s -> 520.89s]  Butt head.
[520.89s -> 522.89s]  I was too busy doing a bad Christopher Walken.
[522.89s -> 524.39s]  Okay, enough Christopher Walken.
[524.39s -> 528.28s]  Let's just play the damn game.
[528.28s -> 530.28s]  Oh, goodness me.
[530.28s -> 534.07s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[534.07s -> 538.00s]  Be patient.
[538.00s -> 549.50s]  I hate being patient.
[549.50s -> 551.00s]  I did that with my mouth.
[551.00s -> 553.14s]  Don't worry.
[553.14s -> 554.14s]  Don't worry.
[554.14s -> 556.72s]  Oh, my.
[556.72s -> 559.22s]  This is just going to get even worse.
[559.22s -> 563.48s]  I don't even know what's going to happen in the later levels.
[563.48s -> 565.48s]  I think we might actually see some germapuke.
[565.48s -> 571.11s]  Do it on this one, then go.
[571.11s -> 574.48s]  Now, don't hit your head on the damn ceiling.
[574.48s -> 582.57s]  Oh, my God.
[582.57s -> 583.57s]  Just do it.
[583.57s -> 584.57s]  Just do it.
[584.57s -> 588.50s]  Smell that?
[588.50s -> 592.74s]  It's called being really mad at this game.
[592.74s -> 596.32s]  I'm not really that mad, to be honest with you.
[596.32s -> 601.14s]  It's kind of fun dying in this game.
[601.14s -> 604.14s]  Only because you know you're going to be able to just do it again.
[604.14s -> 607.14s]  This time, I just undershot it that time.
[607.14s -> 612.24s]  I undershot it that time.
[612.24s -> 615.24s]  Will you just jump down there, you son of a beast sting?
[615.24s -> 619.48s]  The sting is going to be so strong when I sting you in your face.
[619.48s -> 625.95s]  Jump, jump, jump.
[625.95s -> 626.95s]  Now, get over here.
[626.95s -> 632.32s]  If I don't do it this time, I'm going to swallow my freaking mouse.
[632.32s -> 638.62s]  All right, here we go.
[638.62s -> 639.62s]  I got it.
[639.62s -> 642.65s]  It's down.
[642.65s -> 644.65s]  I don't know why I'm having such trouble with this one.
[644.65s -> 647.02s]  This one's not even that difficult.
[647.02s -> 649.02s]  You just have to jump into the damn hole.
[649.02s -> 651.38s]  Just jump into the damn hole.
[651.38s -> 653.38s]  Why is it so hard for me right now?
[653.38s -> 654.69s]  Why?
[654.69s -> 656.89s]  Why?
[656.89s -> 657.89s]  Thank you.
[657.89s -> 663.46s]  Let's see this.
[663.46s -> 667.18s]  I was going to say, did nobody get the key?
[667.18s -> 670.61s]  I wonder how many people die at this little ball.
[670.61s -> 675.33s]  At least one or two.
[675.33s -> 677.33s]  Please, we have to make it to the end.
[677.33s -> 681.62s]  Oh, no, no, please.
[681.62s -> 684.01s]  Goodness gracious.
[684.01s -> 685.01s]  What level are we on?
[685.01s -> 686.44s]  Eleven?
[686.44s -> 687.44s]  We're not even halfway there.
[687.44s -> 690.51s]  Oh, okay.
[690.51s -> 696.21s]  Oh, got to be quicker than that.
[696.21s -> 698.79s]  Up, up.
[698.79s -> 702.93s]  Now, I got to fall in the...
[702.93s -> 707.47s]  Quicker be quicker.
[707.47s -> 708.47s]  Just jump in.
[708.47s -> 710.65s]  Oh, my God.
[710.65s -> 714.42s]  Oh, my God.
[714.42s -> 721.73s]  Up, just like the movie, up.
[721.73s -> 726.97s]  This is what happens when I don't play this game for years, and then I try to...
[726.97s -> 732.14s]  I'm going to throw my controller against the wall.
[732.14s -> 734.69s]  It's going to smash.
[734.69s -> 739.36s]  How am I still missing this?
[739.36s -> 743.92s]  I'm going to smash my controller against the wall.
[743.92s -> 745.92s]  It's going to break into a...
[745.92s -> 753.58s]  Oh, God, I think you have to go like that.
[753.58s -> 758.80s]  Oh, it's getting harder.
[758.80s -> 761.51s]  I'll get out of here.
[761.51s -> 765.12s]  Oh, give me the key.
[765.12s -> 767.45s]  Do the same thing.
[767.45s -> 769.45s]  This time, go the other way.
[769.45s -> 777.38s]  Oh, my God.
[777.38s -> 779.64s]  Don't want to...
[779.64s -> 780.64s]  I remember this part.
[780.64s -> 785.07s]  You don't want to touch all these things because you have to do it again.
[785.07s -> 788.78s]  Oh, no, I forgot to get the key on this.
[788.78s -> 790.78s]  I'm not going to do it this run.
[790.78s -> 791.78s]  There's no way.
[791.78s -> 794.18s]  That's good to know.
[794.18s -> 795.18s]  You have to jump.
[795.18s -> 796.18s]  There you go.
[796.18s -> 797.18s]  There it is.
[797.18s -> 799.18s]  Now, just grab the key right when it falls.
[799.18s -> 800.18s]  Get it.
[800.18s -> 802.18s]  No, that was a trick I used to do, and I never got...
[802.18s -> 803.18s]  I can't get it.
[803.18s -> 807.87s]  Goodness.
[807.87s -> 808.87s]  Goodness me.
[812.16s -> 816.00s]  Up, up, and away we go.
[816.00s -> 817.00s]  Okay, now what?
[817.00s -> 818.00s]  I'm just going to wait.
[818.00s -> 819.82s]  Now go.
[819.82s -> 820.82s]  You know what?
[820.82s -> 821.99s]  Just kill me.
[821.99s -> 824.00s]  Just freaking kill me.
[824.00s -> 826.78s]  Go.
[826.78s -> 828.78s]  That one, that one.
[828.78s -> 829.78s]  I hit the ceiling again.
[829.78s -> 831.78s]  How many times am I going to hit the ceiling?
[831.78s -> 835.82s]  Way too many times I've hit that ceiling.
[835.82s -> 837.57s]  There it is.
[837.57s -> 840.57s]  Get me out of this level.
[840.57s -> 842.13s]  Easy.
[842.13s -> 843.13s]  Easy.
[843.13s -> 847.25s]  Just get in there.
[847.25s -> 848.25s]  All right.
[848.25s -> 850.19s]  I'm going to play with command video here.
[850.19s -> 852.19s]  I remember command video did this quite well.
[852.19s -> 854.71s]  Up and around.
[854.71s -> 855.71s]  Oh, come on.
[855.71s -> 857.71s]  The jump didn't register that time.
[857.71s -> 861.98s]  Are you out of your freaking mind, dude?
[861.98s -> 862.98s]  Up away.
[862.98s -> 863.98s]  Oh, patience.
[863.98s -> 866.86s]  Just stand here.
[866.86s -> 868.29s]  Just wait.
[868.29s -> 871.34s]  Just be, be the meat boy.
[871.34s -> 872.58s]  Be the meat boy.
[872.58s -> 873.58s]  There it is.
[873.58s -> 874.58s]  Be the meat boy.
[874.58s -> 877.15s]  Here we go.
[877.15s -> 880.57s]  Be the meat boy.
[880.57s -> 881.57s]  Yeah.
[881.57s -> 885.37s]  Oh.
[885.37s -> 887.76s]  Be the meat boy.
[887.76s -> 888.76s]  Round and round.
[888.76s -> 889.76s]  Wow.
[889.76s -> 890.76s]  That was very risky.
[890.76s -> 891.76s]  I should not have done that.
[891.76s -> 894.22s]  That was not a good move.
[894.22s -> 895.46s]  Get up here.
[895.46s -> 896.46s]  Oh my.
[896.46s -> 899.81s]  Let's go, boy.
[899.81s -> 900.81s]  Let's go, boy.
[900.81s -> 903.71s]  There's my boy.
[903.71s -> 905.78s]  That's my boy right there.
[905.78s -> 906.78s]  Come here to video.
[906.78s -> 907.78s]  Maybe not.
[907.78s -> 910.05s]  He's a little too slow.
[910.05s -> 911.05s]  Come here to video.
[911.05s -> 914.66s]  Command.
[914.66s -> 915.66s]  This is what.
[915.66s -> 917.98s]  Go back to meat boy.
[917.98s -> 920.76s]  The noises are getting a lot stronger.
[920.76s -> 922.96s]  I can feel my blood boiling right now.
[922.96s -> 924.65s]  Oh.
[924.65s -> 925.65s]  Oh, no.
[925.65s -> 927.14s]  I will get it this time.
[927.14s -> 930.75s]  I just got it.
[930.75s -> 931.75s]  I just got it.
[931.75s -> 932.75s]  I just got it.
[932.75s -> 936.94s]  I just got it.
[936.94s -> 937.94s]  I just got it.
[937.94s -> 938.94s]  I just got it.
[938.94s -> 943.06s]  I just got it.
[943.06s -> 944.06s]  I just got it.
[944.06s -> 945.36s]  I just got it.
[945.36s -> 946.36s]  I just got it.
[946.36s -> 950.54s]  I will get it this time.
[950.54s -> 956.01s]  I just got to get this part correct.
[956.01s -> 959.01s]  Need to stay up there for a split second longer than I already am.
[959.01s -> 960.76s]  Why?
[960.76s -> 963.13s]  Why did that not work?
[963.13s -> 964.94s]  Why?
[964.94s -> 966.94s]  In all that is sacred.
[966.94s -> 970.94s]  Why?
[970.94s -> 973.84s]  Make your way up.
[973.84s -> 978.24s]  Oh, I'm definitely doing something wrong, and I just don't know what I'm doing wrong
[978.24s -> 980.18s]  right now.
[980.18s -> 983.73s]  Maybe I should just make a run for it up there.
[983.73s -> 986.35s]  Pull this thing back, I think, maybe?
[986.35s -> 988.36s]  Like this?
[988.36s -> 989.36s]  Like that?
[989.36s -> 990.36s]  Okay.
[990.36s -> 992.37s]  Exactly.
[992.37s -> 993.37s]  All right.
[993.37s -> 994.37s]  Figured it out.
[994.37s -> 996.95s]  Figured it out.
[996.95s -> 1001.18s]  Now it's just a question of getting over that.
[1001.18s -> 1002.18s]  Whew.
[1002.18s -> 1004.38s]  How many lives is that?
[1004.38s -> 1007.34s]  Half of them died.
[1007.34s -> 1008.58s]  I want to see this.
[1008.58s -> 1014.78s]  I want to see how many of them actually perished up here on this turn here.
[1014.78s -> 1017.09s]  Here we go, guys.
[1017.09s -> 1018.84s]  Wee.
[1018.84s -> 1019.84s]  I'm going here.
[1019.84s -> 1020.84s]  Go.
[1020.84s -> 1028.12s]  Oh, is this thing the thing that shoots the stuff all over the place?
[1028.12s -> 1031.45s]  This needs to fire me.
[1031.45s -> 1032.45s]  Come on.
[1032.45s -> 1036.57s]  Hello.
[1036.57s -> 1038.58s]  Wow.
[1038.58s -> 1040.90s]  Wow.
[1040.90s -> 1044.28s]  I've got to stay up there a little longer.
[1044.28s -> 1047.95s]  Maybe not.
[1047.95s -> 1048.95s]  Yep.
[1048.95s -> 1049.95s]  That's how you do it.
[1049.95s -> 1050.95s]  What?
[1050.95s -> 1053.66s]  What?
[1053.66s -> 1054.66s]  What?
[1054.66s -> 1056.54s]  What?
[1056.54s -> 1057.54s]  What?
[1057.54s -> 1060.70s]  What?
[1060.70s -> 1061.70s]  What?
[1061.70s -> 1064.54s]  What?
[1064.54s -> 1065.54s]  What?
[1065.54s -> 1066.54s]  What?
[1066.54s -> 1067.54s]  What?
[1067.54s -> 1068.54s]  Oh, my God.
[1068.54s -> 1070.17s]  I hate this part.
[1070.17s -> 1073.52s]  I hate this.
[1073.52s -> 1074.52s]  Why?
[1074.52s -> 1076.40s]  Why?
[1076.40s -> 1078.79s]  Why are you doing this to me?
[1078.79s -> 1079.79s]  Okay.
[1079.79s -> 1080.79s]  Obviously.
[1080.79s -> 1082.67s]  Obviously, I need to jump first.
[1082.67s -> 1084.30s]  No, that's not what's the matter.
[1084.30s -> 1085.30s]  Yes.
[1085.30s -> 1089.08s]  No, it wasn't.
[1089.08s -> 1090.08s]  Oh, no, it wasn't.
[1090.08s -> 1094.92s]  God, I can't handle this.
[1094.92s -> 1096.92s]  I can't handle this.
[1096.92s -> 1101.95s]  I think I maybe have to stand still over here.
[1101.95s -> 1106.88s]  No, that just gets me killed again.
[1106.88s -> 1110.40s]  I think initially you got to do it.
[1110.40s -> 1111.40s]  Then you got to run.
[1111.40s -> 1112.90s]  Yeah.
[1112.90s -> 1113.90s]  Oh, dear.
[1113.90s -> 1114.90s]  Oh, my God.
[1114.90s -> 1116.90s]  I got through it, and it didn't even matter.
[1116.90s -> 1123.09s]  Wait for him.
[1123.09s -> 1124.09s]  Silent.
[1124.09s -> 1125.09s]  Silent anger.
[1125.09s -> 1127.54s]  All right.
[1127.54s -> 1128.78s]  Just wait.
[1128.78s -> 1136.46s]  This is not cool.
[1136.46s -> 1139.46s]  Get me out of here, please.
[1139.46s -> 1142.41s]  A plus, apparently.
[1142.41s -> 1143.41s]  After all that.
[1143.41s -> 1150.88s]  Oh, up here.
[1150.88s -> 1152.18s]  Easy.
[1152.18s -> 1153.18s]  Easy.
[1153.18s -> 1157.83s]  Easy, breezy, beautiful cover girl.
[1157.83s -> 1159.58s]  I know that commercial.
[1159.58s -> 1162.27s]  I've seen that commercial before.
[1162.27s -> 1167.78s]  I'm just trying to not psych myself out.
[1167.78s -> 1168.78s]  There we are.
[1168.78s -> 1170.53s]  Good.
[1170.53s -> 1171.53s]  Getting close here.
[1171.53s -> 1174.60s]  I think there's only one or two more that I'm at the boss.
[1174.60s -> 1175.60s]  Please don't kill me.
[1175.60s -> 1176.60s]  Oh.
[1176.60s -> 1178.03s]  Oh, God.
[1178.03s -> 1179.34s]  He's relentless.
[1179.34s -> 1180.34s]  Please.
[1181.34s -> 1183.28s]  What?
[1183.28s -> 1184.28s]  I was out of range.
[1184.28s -> 1186.28s]  Oh, these things don't have range.
[1186.28s -> 1190.90s]  Oh, I was about to just say a very bad word right there, but I didn't.
[1190.90s -> 1195.19s]  Get away from me.
[1195.19s -> 1196.43s]  Here he comes.
[1196.43s -> 1198.43s]  Of course it's going to go in that spot.
[1198.43s -> 1200.43s]  Right where I'm landing.
[1200.43s -> 1201.43s]  Of course it is.
[1201.43s -> 1204.89s]  You hungry, hungry hippo.
[1204.89s -> 1209.28s]  You know, I was just standing there just blanking out.
[1209.28s -> 1213.71s]  I was just standing still saying to myself, I just stand here.
[1213.71s -> 1214.71s]  This is all right.
[1214.71s -> 1215.71s]  I'm safe.
[1215.71s -> 1222.05s]  The torture is almost over.
[1222.05s -> 1224.61s]  I'm almost through hell.
[1224.61s -> 1227.30s]  And then I have what's left?
[1227.30s -> 1228.30s]  Rapture?
[1228.30s -> 1229.30s]  Whatever it's called.
[1229.30s -> 1231.86s]  Okay, don't make that same mistake.
[1231.86s -> 1240.86s]  It's so much trouble to get through that.
[1240.86s -> 1242.61s]  Phew.
[1242.61s -> 1245.83s]  The hive.
[1245.83s -> 1248.90s]  Get me.
[1248.90s -> 1250.90s]  I have to wait till this is down.
[1250.90s -> 1252.08s]  Oh, it was down.
[1252.08s -> 1253.08s]  Almost down.
[1253.08s -> 1257.11s]  Why am I going through there?
[1257.11s -> 1260.72s]  Just wait till he jumps and then wait till he does it again.
[1260.72s -> 1261.72s]  Go.
[1261.72s -> 1263.73s]  Oh my God.
[1263.73s -> 1266.99s]  I just almost choked.
[1266.99s -> 1270.42s]  That's how much I'm raging right now.
[1270.42s -> 1278.79s]  Gotta be quiet.
[1278.79s -> 1279.79s]  That's the only way I can do this.
[1279.79s -> 1283.61s]  As if I'm just...
[1283.61s -> 1288.60s]  Stand still and jump over.
[1288.60s -> 1290.60s]  It's such an easy pattern.
[1290.60s -> 1295.38s]  Why can I not get it down?
[1295.38s -> 1298.55s]  My blood is just on fire right now.
[1298.55s -> 1301.24s]  I could just...
[1301.24s -> 1302.24s]  I'm going to...
[1302.24s -> 1304.24s]  I can't even think of words right now.
[1304.24s -> 1305.24s]  I'm so mad.
[1305.24s -> 1308.70s]  Just do it again.
[1308.70s -> 1309.70s]  Do it again.
[1309.70s -> 1311.20s]  Now go.
[1311.20s -> 1312.20s]  Just nice and easy.
[1312.20s -> 1314.66s]  This is it.
[1314.66s -> 1315.83s]  And then we're at the...
[1315.83s -> 1319.42s]  We're at the boss after this.
[1319.42s -> 1320.42s]  I remember this level.
[1320.42s -> 1321.42s]  This level is so terrible.
[1321.42s -> 1323.49s]  You have to...
[1323.49s -> 1331.53s]  This level is so long.
[1331.53s -> 1338.26s]  It requires so much patience, which I don't have.
[1338.26s -> 1353.18s]  Why did I try and get the bandaid?
[1353.18s -> 1355.81s]  I thought that was a key.
[1355.81s -> 1358.81s]  My puny brain thought that was a key.
[1358.81s -> 1363.07s]  I can't believe I did that.
[1363.07s -> 1368.06s]  Gotta stay confident here.
[1368.06s -> 1369.62s]  It's the last level.
[1369.62s -> 1373.00s]  I can't let this beat me.
[1373.00s -> 1374.00s]  Gotta push forward.
[1374.00s -> 1376.26s]  Can't let it beat me.
[1376.26s -> 1377.26s]  Come on.
[1377.26s -> 1381.00s]  Let's go.
[1381.00s -> 1382.00s]  And go.
[1382.00s -> 1384.00s]  One, two, tie my shoe.
[1384.00s -> 1385.00s]  Three, four.
[1385.00s -> 1387.14s]  What?
[1387.14s -> 1391.21s]  I wasn't even sticking out.
[1391.21s -> 1395.88s]  I could be mad right now, but that was just stupid.
[1395.88s -> 1398.31s]  I was barely sticking out right there.
[1398.31s -> 1400.32s]  Even Meat Boy is mad.
[1400.32s -> 1401.32s]  Look at him.
[1401.32s -> 1403.32s]  I'm so mad right now.
[1403.32s -> 1409.49s]  What?
[1409.49s -> 1411.18s]  What the hell is going on?
[1411.18s -> 1418.24s]  Just go.
[1418.24s -> 1420.24s]  Just get her.
[1420.24s -> 1421.99s]  This is it.
[1421.99s -> 1424.68s]  Time to play.
[1424.68s -> 1428.94s]  I have no idea how long this is going to take me.
[1428.94s -> 1430.57s]  Let's see, though.
[1430.57s -> 1432.83s]  What was that?
[1432.83s -> 1434.46s]  What the hell is going on?
[1434.46s -> 1436.46s]  What are these bodies doing falling down?
[1436.46s -> 1438.95s]  Dude, are you dead?
[1438.95s -> 1440.13s]  Weep, weep.
[1440.13s -> 1443.13s]  Dude, you gotta get up, man.
[1443.13s -> 1444.13s]  What the hell?
[1444.13s -> 1448.43s]  Okay, that plus Spike equals death.
[1448.43s -> 1449.43s]  Help me, please.
[1449.43s -> 1450.67s]  He's got me.
[1450.67s -> 1451.67s]  You'll never get away.
[1451.67s -> 1452.67s]  There's lava here, stupid.
[1452.67s -> 1453.67s]  Man, he's right.
[1453.67s -> 1454.67s]  There's lava.
[1454.67s -> 1455.67s]  Oh, look.
[1455.67s -> 1456.67s]  What the hell is that?
[1456.67s -> 1457.67s]  Oh, my goodness.
[1457.67s -> 1459.04s]  Okay, this is getting old.
[1459.04s -> 1460.04s]  Oh, he's mad.
[1460.04s -> 1461.66s]  I remember this part.
[1461.66s -> 1462.66s]  I remember what happens here.
[1462.66s -> 1463.66s]  This is really hard.
[1463.66s -> 1465.80s]  And he...
[1465.80s -> 1466.80s]  Oh, I remember this.
[1466.80s -> 1467.80s]  This is going to take forever.
[1467.80s -> 1468.80s]  This is going to take a million years.
[1468.80s -> 1469.80s]  Oh, guys.
[1469.80s -> 1470.80s]  I need to like...
[1470.80s -> 1472.74s]  Oh, no.
[1473.74s -> 1474.74s]  I'm so scared right now because he does this punch move.
[1474.74s -> 1475.74s]  Oh, no.
[1475.74s -> 1476.74s]  Here it is.
[1476.74s -> 1477.74s]  Jump.
[1477.74s -> 1479.24s]  He does it again.
[1479.24s -> 1480.24s]  This is all about patterns here.
[1480.24s -> 1482.82s]  And he has to do that three times.
[1482.82s -> 1489.74s]  So then he punches once, twice, and then in the middle.
[1489.74s -> 1492.96s]  So, go for it.
[1492.96s -> 1499.76s]  One, two, middle.
[1499.76s -> 1508.72s]  One, two, three, two.
[1508.72s -> 1515.14s]  one two middle yep okay now what is he gonna do he's gonna punch the side and
[1515.14s -> 1525.39s]  he's gonna come over this way yeah he's gonna do it again no he doesn't jump no
[1525.39s -> 1532.18s]  so this might be a 97 minute long meat boy cuz this is gonna take a long time
