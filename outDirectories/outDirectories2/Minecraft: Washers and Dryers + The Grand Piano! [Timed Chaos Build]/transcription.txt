[0.31s -> 9.18s]  Hey, that's what we're doing.
[9.18s -> 11.18s]  No, we're not doing a washer and dryer.
[11.18s -> 13.18s]  Yeah, that's what we're doing.
[13.18s -> 16.18s]  We better start recording right now, because I'm going to start fucking building it.
[16.18s -> 18.62s]  No, we're not doing a washer and dryer.
[18.62s -> 26.43s]  Hi guys, today we're going to create a fucking washer and dryer on Jeremy's channel, there.
[26.43s -> 28.43s]  Alright, fine, right here.
[28.43s -> 30.43s]  No, he already finished it. That was it.
[30.43s -> 33.43s]  Look, it's a washer and dryer. It's a big square.
[33.43s -> 37.43s]  Stop. You already made it. You put two of them next to each other and you said, done.
[37.43s -> 39.43s]  Oh, that's it?
[39.43s -> 46.50s]  Yeah, done. Thank you, subscribe, and, you know, bitch.
[50.97s -> 52.97s]  Alright, I actually was recording during that, so that's fine.
[52.97s -> 54.97s]  And then it just like flew away.
[54.97s -> 56.97s]  This is the Aladdin's phone.
[56.97s -> 59.14s]  Washer and dryer. Alright, what are we really going to make?
[59.14s -> 61.14s]  Alright, so did you record that? Because that was pretty funny.
[61.14s -> 62.58s]  Yeah, I did.
[62.58s -> 65.50s]  Cool, that better be up.
[65.50s -> 67.94s]  How about like, I don't know, like a jack-o-lantern?
[67.94s -> 70.24s]  Alright, Spoon, thanks for joining us, man.
[70.24s -> 72.91s]  No problem.
[72.91s -> 75.98s]  A jack-o-lantern.
[75.98s -> 77.98s]  Let's make a fridge!
[77.98s -> 81.12s]  Hi, we're back again!
[81.12s -> 83.12s]  Done!
[83.12s -> 85.12s]  Oh, there he goes again.
[85.12s -> 87.49s]  Flying away.
[87.49s -> 91.92s]  Alright, so we got fridge, washer, dryer, and, yeah.
[91.92s -> 94.74s]  We've got something else.
[94.74s -> 96.98s]  Oh no, what's he got?
[96.98s -> 101.75s]  How long is it taking him to get down here?
[101.75s -> 105.34s]  Ready?
[105.34s -> 108.92s]  Stove!
[108.92s -> 110.92s]  The stove looks eerily similar to the washer and dryer.
[110.92s -> 112.92s]  Well then, we'll just do this.
[112.92s -> 116.50s]  Shouldn't the stove be like that?
[116.50s -> 119.32s]  Nope.
[119.32s -> 121.32s]  Oh great, now you made it rain.
[121.32s -> 123.32s]  Oh shit, I'm shitting all over the washer and dryer.
[123.32s -> 125.50s]  And I broke the ground.
[125.50s -> 127.74s]  I know what we're making.
[127.74s -> 130.22s]  A piano.
[130.22s -> 132.39s]  Three, two, one.
[132.39s -> 134.57s]  Let's do it. Alright, seven minutes, boys.
[134.57s -> 137.06s]  Hey, the piano's off! What are you doing?
[137.06s -> 139.06s]  The piano's not white!
[139.06s -> 141.06s]  That's for the keys!
[141.06s -> 143.06s]  The piano's to be up in the air, you can't...
[143.06s -> 145.06s]  Like you pull out the plates, Matt.
[145.06s -> 147.50s]  And it's just one of those like...
[147.50s -> 149.67s]  This isn't a movie.
[149.67s -> 151.67s]  This isn't like big, when Tom Hanks like
[151.67s -> 154.17s]  jumps on the thing on the ground.
[154.17s -> 156.17s]  Is that the piano leg right there?
[156.17s -> 158.60s]  Alright, that's gonna be one of the legs.
[158.60s -> 160.60s]  I'm gonna go over here to do a third leg.
[160.60s -> 164.38s]  Over here.
[164.38s -> 166.38s]  I'm just gonna sit here and watch.
[166.38s -> 168.38s]  Oh come on!
[168.38s -> 170.38s]  We don't have that much time.
[170.38s -> 172.68s]  Yeah, we can finish this, you guys.
[172.68s -> 174.68s]  Wait.
[174.68s -> 177.18s]  I'm just gonna sit here and watch.
[177.18s -> 179.18s]  Alright, no, come together, come together.
[179.18s -> 181.54s]  What is that? These are the legs.
[181.54s -> 183.54s]  Hey, you gotta do some work.
[183.54s -> 185.54s]  Why is this so big?
[185.54s -> 187.54s]  Spooner's not doing anything.
[187.54s -> 189.54s]  I'm doing something, I don't know what you guys are talking about.
[189.54s -> 191.54s]  Stop making fun of me, okay?
[191.54s -> 193.91s]  We're gonna build the piano.
[193.91s -> 195.91s]  I'm building a piano, do you see this?
[195.91s -> 198.15s]  Alright, come up with that leg.
[198.15s -> 200.15s]  One minute has gone by, we got only seven.
[200.15s -> 202.15s]  Everything looks very similar to that horse we did that one time.
[202.15s -> 204.15s]  Hey, everything looks like that horse we did that one time.
[204.15s -> 206.65s]  Hey.
[206.65s -> 209.46s]  I wouldn't speak about horses.
[209.46s -> 211.64s]  Alright, let's go, come on around here.
[211.64s -> 213.64s]  Oh yeah, I forgot, you are a horse.
[213.64s -> 216.07s]  Forget that sometimes.
[216.07s -> 218.76s]  Is that enough?
[218.76s -> 220.76s]  That looks good, yeah.
[220.76s -> 222.76s]  Remember, we don't have to fill it in, that's one of the things in the comments people were saying.
[222.76s -> 224.76s]  They're like, don't fill it in.
[224.76s -> 227.94s]  No, we need to fill it in, otherwise it's not real, and it won't work.
[227.94s -> 229.94s]  It's a functioning piano.
[229.94s -> 232.95s]  Alright, have this one come up too.
[232.95s -> 236.02s]  Too far.
[236.02s -> 238.02s]  This is huge.
[238.02s -> 240.02s]  This is way, way, way too big.
[240.02s -> 242.90s]  Okay, so where's the front of it?
[242.90s -> 244.90s]  I don't know.
[244.90s -> 246.90s]  We're just like in a giant black cube.
[246.90s -> 248.90s]  Like four legs right now.
[248.90s -> 250.90s]  Alright, this will be the front right here.
[250.90s -> 253.46s]  I'll work on the front.
[253.46s -> 255.46s]  You guys close off, this is so big, it's like a highway.
[255.46s -> 258.28s]  Dude, this is amazing.
[258.28s -> 263.58s]  I'm doing the front, I'm doing the front.
[263.58s -> 265.94s]  I'm filling it in.
[265.94s -> 268.25s]  Okay, so the front is where?
[268.25s -> 270.25s]  Where the keys are.
[270.25s -> 272.25s]  That's what I'm doing, I'm working on that right now.
[272.25s -> 274.25s]  Wait, what? It's down here? Why is this piano long?
[274.25s -> 276.25s]  They're supposed to be wider than they are long.
[278.49s -> 280.49s]  This is a different kind of piano, it's like different.
[283.50s -> 285.50s]  This is like a Mack truck piano.
[285.50s -> 290.62s]  Alright, as long as, remember the butt comes up.
[290.62s -> 292.62s]  Come on, why do we have to make it this long?
[294.62s -> 296.62s]  You said a giant piano.
[296.62s -> 299.05s]  I know, it's all my own fault.
[299.05s -> 301.05s]  Which one's the front?
[301.05s -> 303.05s]  Yeah, I'm at the front right now.
[303.05s -> 305.48s]  You're at the front?
[308.23s -> 310.23s]  Pianos are wider.
[310.23s -> 312.41s]  This is just long.
[312.41s -> 314.78s]  What the hell do keys look like?
[314.78s -> 316.78s]  Just like two or three blocks long.
[320.10s -> 322.98s]  Is this working?
[322.98s -> 324.98s]  No.
[324.98s -> 326.98s]  Does this piano have like four keys?
[326.98s -> 328.98s]  I have like four keys.
[328.98s -> 330.98s]  Oh, do you want me to play you a song?
[330.98s -> 333.86s]  Sorry, I can only play hot cross buns.
[333.86s -> 335.86s]  Yeah, you can only play the first part of Chopsticks.
[339.86s -> 342.87s]  So what should be the black keys?
[342.87s -> 344.87s]  Oh, this is just huge.
[344.87s -> 346.87s]  I don't know. Spoon help.
[346.87s -> 349.05s]  What, spoon, what, who, for what?
[351.05s -> 353.67s]  You gotta close the gap.
[356.94s -> 358.94s]  Actually, it doesn't really look that bad.
[358.94s -> 360.94s]  No, it does.
[360.94s -> 364.58s]  Yeah, don't criticize your own work, are you kidding me?
[364.58s -> 368.81s]  You know how hard we worked on this thing?
[368.81s -> 372.46s]  Alright, the keys really do need to be
[372.46s -> 374.46s]  a little bit better than that.
[374.46s -> 376.46s]  There need to be more of them.
[376.46s -> 379.59s]  No, it's just, it's fine.
[379.59s -> 381.59s]  You put them at the wrong end.
[383.59s -> 386.34s]  Hold on, we can widen it a little bit.
[386.34s -> 388.58s]  Dude, we'd have a better chance of like
[388.58s -> 390.58s]  just turning this into a guitar right now
[390.58s -> 392.58s]  than just finishing it at the piano.
[392.58s -> 394.58s]  It's gonna be a giant guitar.
[398.49s -> 400.86s]  It just looks like a giant thing with big teeth.
[400.86s -> 405.14s]  Like a big monster.
[405.14s -> 407.58s]  It looks like Tetris.
[407.58s -> 409.75s]  So we gotta do one of these episodes
[409.75s -> 411.75s]  saying, we're not telling them what it is
[411.75s -> 413.75s]  and we just make it and people have to guess
[413.75s -> 415.75s]  what it is.
[415.75s -> 417.75s]  That's actually a pretty good idea.
[417.75s -> 419.75s]  Let's start with this one. Just bleep out the word.
[423.14s -> 425.14s]  Every time somebody says the word piano, I'll bleep it.
[425.14s -> 427.51s]  I'll just put like a sensor.
[427.51s -> 429.51s]  Hey guys, this is pretty funny.
[429.51s -> 431.51s]  Just do that. It works.
[431.51s -> 433.51s]  Alright, five minutes have gone by.
[433.51s -> 436.97s]  We gotta close this out.
[436.97s -> 438.97s]  It works. Alright, look at this.
[438.97s -> 441.83s]  This is beautiful.
[441.83s -> 443.83s]  Good thing I made it so the keys come out
[443.83s -> 445.83s]  way too far.
[445.83s -> 449.42s]  What is this?
[449.42s -> 453.45s]  It's all good. This is great.
[453.45s -> 455.82s]  This is fantastic.
[455.82s -> 460.22s]  We're gonna sell this for so much.
[460.22s -> 462.22s]  I don't even know what to think right now.
[462.22s -> 464.22s]  Just for reference, we said the piano is huge.
[464.22s -> 466.22s]  The piano is actually
[466.22s -> 468.22s]  bigger than this person.
[468.22s -> 471.03s]  It's about as big as a house.
[471.03s -> 473.46s]  A nice piano house.
[473.46s -> 475.46s]  That being said for how big it is,
[475.46s -> 477.46s]  it has a surprising
[477.46s -> 479.46s]  very small amount of
[479.46s -> 483.67s]  keys.
[483.67s -> 485.67s]  What is the rest of this piano for?
[485.67s -> 488.10s]  Why is it so big if it has no purpose?
[488.10s -> 490.10s]  It's a house.
[490.10s -> 492.66s]  You can live in the piano
[492.66s -> 496.18s]  and you can also tickle me.
[499.43s -> 501.43s]  Alright, so we are allowed to do
[501.43s -> 504.12s]  that spoon apparently.
[504.12s -> 506.12s]  How much time?
[506.12s -> 508.68s]  We have like 40 seconds.
[508.68s -> 510.68s]  Is there any detailed work we can do
[510.68s -> 512.68s]  with this thing?
[512.68s -> 514.68s]  Absolutely not. It's ruined.
[514.68s -> 520.23s]  This has to come out like this.
[520.23s -> 522.23s]  This is one of those games where you stand up
[522.23s -> 524.60s]  and play it. You got no chair.
[524.60s -> 526.60s]  This is one of those pianos where you drink like an elixir
[526.60s -> 528.60s]  and you grow 50 feet tall and then you play it.
[528.60s -> 531.42s]  Look at that grand piano.
[531.42s -> 534.62s]  I'm making a quick chair.
[534.62s -> 536.79s]  It's not making towers.
[536.79s -> 541.83s]  It's a chair.
[541.83s -> 543.83s]  I don't like this very much.
[543.83s -> 546.46s]  This has to go. 10 seconds.
[546.46s -> 548.70s]  Stop ruining my work.
[548.70s -> 550.70s]  5, 4, 3, 2,
[550.70s -> 552.87s]  1, and get the chair done!
[552.87s -> 554.87s]  And there it is. Nice.
[554.87s -> 557.56s]  And that's it. Grand piano.
[557.56s -> 559.80s]  That's the chair balancing.
[559.80s -> 561.98s]  What human being
[561.98s -> 563.98s]  sits on this chair
[563.98s -> 565.98s]  like this small?
[565.98s -> 567.98s]  This is not even room for one butt cheek for apparently
[567.98s -> 569.98s]  who's big enough to touch this keyboard.
[569.98s -> 572.66s]  You made the chair too big.
[572.66s -> 574.66s]  And that is going to wrap up the video.
[574.66s -> 576.66s]  So thank you guys so much for watching.
[576.66s -> 578.66s]  Leave a comment with the name and the rating for this thing.
[578.66s -> 580.66s]  It looks pretty much like a piano.
[580.66s -> 582.66s]  I don't know, you guys can be the judge of that one.
[582.66s -> 584.66s]  But I'll see you guys all soon
[584.66s -> 586.66s]  and take care everybody.
