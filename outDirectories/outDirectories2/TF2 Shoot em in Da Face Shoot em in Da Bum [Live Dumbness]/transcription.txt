[2.68s -> 10.23s]  Oh, you're hurting the the defenseless heavy. You're hitting the defenseless like toupee heavy.
[10.23s -> 18.47s]  He's trying to holiday punch people, see? What'd you do? I didn't do anything!
[28.26s -> 48.34s]  This guy is just... you're missing... he's missing over and over again. Dude,
[48.34s -> 54.97s]  maybe you should get a little closer instead of just like shooting long-range rockets at me.
[54.97s -> 63.29s]  What the fuck are you doing? What? Dude, I can't believe... what just happened?
[63.93s -> 72.12s]  That was out... okay. Are people just blind right now? What is going on? That guy was a spy.
[74.79s -> 80.47s]  Oh my god, I've never seen such a well-decorated last point. Yeah, I'm looking at this right now.
[80.47s -> 86.55s]  I'm looking at it on Spectator, it's hilarious. Oh, that sick like surround sound setup you guys got
[86.55s -> 93.99s]  there. It's like Dolby 5.1 up there. It really is. I'm gonna do a coffee commentary of Doom. Oh,
[93.99s -> 100.79s]  you want to do a coffee commentary of Justice and Doom? Yes. Headshot. I want to show you how we
[100.79s -> 104.23s]  headshot, we headshot, and this is how we headshot. We should've been the face and we should've been
[104.23s -> 107.91s]  the bum. That is how we do it. One and a two and a three and a four and one and a two and a three
[107.91s -> 110.63s]  and a four. Three headshots in a row. What do you know about that?
[110.63s -> 127.78s]  Headshot. Headshot. Headshot. Headshot. Headshot. Headshot. Headshot. Headshot. Headshot. Headshot.
[127.78s -> 138.50s]  Hey, Star, where are you? You wanted to make save? Are you serious?
[143.43s -> 147.67s]  You freaked out and you like swept around. You weren't even there. You weren't even...
[147.67s -> 150.55s]  You're a ghost. Now I got balanced onto your stupid team.
[153.29s -> 158.31s]  Yo, you're real, okay. Lots of people down there, holy crap. I keep getting extinguished.
[159.03s -> 164.55s]  I was so scared. I'm so scared. Is there a health pack? No, it's a defensor!
[167.75s -> 173.51s]  This is the worst thing, dude. I'm stuck up here. How? Oh, okay. I don't know what to do.
[175.11s -> 179.43s]  How dumb did I look when I just ran, sprinted and clenched at your feet on fire. It was awesome.
[179.43s -> 188.84s]  Oh my god, this... Look, I had no idea I was there. If I can get this to level three,
[189.40s -> 201.96s]  you gotta be kidding me, dude. I'm building a nest up here. This is a very dangerous thing I'm doing.
[202.52s -> 214.17s]  This is very dangerous. This is too dangerous. I'm getting the hell out of here. Get me the hell
[214.17s -> 223.13s]  out of here. Get me the hell out of here. No, damn it, you fucking little mini sentry.
[224.87s -> 230.60s]  Fuck yeah. There's only one medic and a pyro. He didn't get... How did he not get hit by that crit?
[230.60s -> 235.14s]  You're dead. Did you have a sandwich? Did you just fall off the edge?
[236.66s -> 240.02s]  I did have a sandwich. And I just fell off the edge. I fell off after you.
[241.38s -> 245.14s]  I was so intrigued by if you fell off or not that I jumped off the edge too.
[245.86s -> 251.51s]  Who's the only one that made it out of that alive? Wow. I see. I have to check and see if you die.
[251.51s -> 259.72s]  I die. I can't see his body. You were on fire and you shot a cheeseburger body and fell down the
[259.72s -> 270.34s]  hole. Yeah, it just flopped off the edge while I was eating my sandwich. All right. Can I be on
[270.34s -> 281.05s]  your team? That was a double headshot. Hey, Heavy, when you come around this corner, I'm gonna... What
[281.05s -> 286.38s]  the hell is going on? You wanna get turned into a fried egg? You wanna get turned into a fried egg?
[287.02s -> 292.97s]  Oh, I have my buff banner on crap. All right. Thank you, medic. Who wants to get turned into
[292.97s -> 301.02s]  a friggin' fried egg? This guy right here does. Fried egg. You want a fried egg? Oh, that guy
[301.02s -> 308.09s]  didn't want a fried egg. Hey, you want some hash? Where are you? I can't hit this guy. Thank you.
[308.09s -> 314.33s]  Somebody killed him. Watch out. That's a spy. No, it's not. Just an engineer with a shotgun.
[314.33s -> 323.00s]  Watch out for that spy. Nope. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Cap, cap, cap, cap, cap, cap, cap.
[323.00s -> 331.26s]  Go festival, M. Quit drinking. We need to talk about that. It calms my nerves. We're gonna have
[331.26s -> 337.19s]  to talk about you drinking on the job every day. I've got a crown. I can do whatever I want.
[337.19s -> 346.94s]  Well, you could follow me. You're like, I feel like you're gonna backstab me. Egg. Oh, here we go.
[349.30s -> 358.71s]  Nice crits. Nice crits. Yay. Well, it looked like you weren't on my team. It looked like for a second
[358.71s -> 367.69s]  you weren't on my team. There is like two quick fix mechs on this team. On their team or ours?
[367.69s -> 370.65s]  I'm just like baiting people in here to like get killed by this entry.
[372.49s -> 379.54s]  No, you want to have a melee fight? Let's go. Come on, come get me. Yeah, come get me. Ow.
[384.15s -> 391.90s]  Oh my god, I've gotten this guy like five or six kills on this century. God. No. No. Where's the
[391.90s -> 400.50s]  engineer? Is he dead? Damn it. Well, that's not good. Run away. Spy is still alive, by the way.
[400.50s -> 402.98s]  Give me the health. Give me the health. Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?
[402.98s -> 413.91s]  Bad move. Bad move. Turn around. Run away. I knew it. What the fuck?
