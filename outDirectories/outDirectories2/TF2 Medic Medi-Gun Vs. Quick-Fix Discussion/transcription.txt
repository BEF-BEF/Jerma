[0.31s -> 13.71s]  Hey, what is happening everybody? Hope you're having a fantastic day so far. My name is
[13.71s -> 19.51s]  Germa if you didn't already know that. We're gonna be playing some Team Fortress 2 gameplay
[19.51s -> 23.03s]  commentary. What a different intro. Usually I have the same intro the whole day. That
[23.03s -> 28.50s]  was a weird intro. Anyways, gonna be playing as the medic tonight and we're gonna specifically
[28.50s -> 34.70s]  be talking about a couple of points, mainly the big debate between should I throw the
[34.70s -> 39.78s]  quick fix into the toilet and hit the flush button? And the answer to that question is
[39.78s -> 44.46s]  no, because the quick fix won't fit in the toilet. So if you try and flush it, it won't
[44.46s -> 50.37s]  go anywhere. And because it's actually worth something. A lot of people like to trash this
[50.37s -> 53.91s]  weapon or this item, whatever you want to call it. People like to really call this the
[53.91s -> 59.63s]  worst medigun. It's not even worth equipping, et cetera, et cetera. And I don't necessarily
[59.63s -> 64.19s]  agree with that. There's a ton of situations, and I'm gonna really detail one of them in
[64.19s -> 69.55s]  this video, where you really do need the quick fix. And it's a big deal. And a lot of people
[69.55s -> 74.50s]  really overlook this fact. And it's something you really have to take into consideration.
[74.50s -> 79.42s]  So when you're on a team of, let's say just Valve's default, Valve says 12 on 12 is what
[79.42s -> 84.42s]  we want Team Fortress to be. That's what it's gonna be. So 12 on 12, if there's one medic
[84.42s -> 88.58s]  on the team, even if there's one medic on the, let me rephrase that, if there is even
[88.58s -> 93.80s]  one person healing on the team, it's a lot to deal with. Especially when you're in a
[93.80s -> 97.44s]  game where there's a lot of damage going around. As you'll see in this gameplay, there's
[97.44s -> 101.48s]  a lot of people taking damage. A lot of people are getting killed. A lot of people are flying
[101.48s -> 105.40s]  back and forth. Especially, this is like a very small, dense map. King of the Hill maps
[105.40s -> 109.48s]  are the same way. This is Capture the Flag, by the way. I didn't even tell you the map.
[109.48s -> 114.12s]  Capture the Flag Turbine. And it's a very condensed map. So there's people all over
[114.12s -> 119.62s]  the place. And with the default medigun or the Kritzkrieg, you're talking about a slower
[119.94s -> 123.92s]  heal rate and you're talking about overheal. So you have to put the medigun on somebody
[123.92s -> 128.22s]  for a lot longer than you would with the quick fix. And let's just say for the sake of argument,
[128.22s -> 134.06s]  the one medic on that team, if he wasn't there, you wouldn't be getting any overheal anyways.
[134.06s -> 140.06s]  So the overheal argument is true. I totally agree with the fact that overheal is incredibly
[140.06s -> 144.78s]  necessary. It's a really big part of the game. But if there's a medic on the team healing
[144.94s -> 150.30s]  people, he's still doing work. He's still doing his job. It's not like he's sitting AFK in
[150.30s -> 154.66s]  the spawn or something like that. He's still healing. And it's really, really much easier
[154.66s -> 160.06s]  when you play with the quick fix if you are one person on a team to keep everybody healed.
[160.06s -> 164.42s]  It's very difficult. I can't tell you how many situations I've been in when I have not
[164.42s -> 168.74s]  been using the quick fix and we're turning a corner and there's five people that need
[168.74s -> 174.22s]  to be healed and I have the regular medigun and I'm just like, I'm sorry, three or four
[174.38s -> 178.57s]  you are going to die. There's nothing I can do about that. So what you're really watching
[178.57s -> 182.05s]  on the screen right now is you're watching me play with the quick fix and then you're
[182.05s -> 187.01s]  watching me play with the default medigun and they're both in very, very similar situations
[187.01s -> 190.93s]  and I'm going to freeze it here coming up in a second. I'm going to show you that exact
[190.93s -> 194.49s]  situation I'm talking about where you get into trouble with the regular medigun and
[194.49s -> 199.65s]  you get yourself killed. Okay, so let's transition to the regular medigun here and take a look.
[199.65s -> 203.73s]  I'm going to freeze it. There are one, two, three, four, four people here that need to
[203.73s -> 207.93s]  be healed, all of them which are on fire or at least the two that can be on fire and
[207.93s -> 211.81s]  I can't heal them. I can try and put it on them for a second but they're still taking
[211.81s -> 216.21s]  so much damage and if I had had the quick fix, say, take a look at this pyro, I probably
[216.21s -> 220.13s]  could have filled him up by now but no, a pyro comes from behind us, gets me lit on
[220.13s -> 225.25s]  fire and this scout I pull out the needle gun probably should have switched to the medigun.
[225.25s -> 229.27s]  I thought I had the blutsauger for a second but I did not. But as you can see, this situation
[229.27s -> 235.30s]  turns out very, very badly and I run for the hell that I do not make it. So that's
[235.30s -> 240.44s]  exactly what I'm talking about. Those group situations where you need to really spread
[240.44s -> 244.22s]  the heals around when a ton of people are taking damage and there's really nothing
[244.22s -> 250.30s]  you can do about it. That's where the quick fix is definitely a huge plus and a huge definitely
[250.30s -> 255.20s]  one up on the other two mediguns. Now, there's a century around this corner and I'm going
[255.20s -> 260.21s]  to show you a reason why you need to switch sometimes. There is nothing that is more power
[260.21s -> 267.01s]  full than an ubered class. So obviously, you can't really take out a big sentry nest with
[267.01s -> 271.13s]  the quick fix. Sometimes you can. Sometimes there's a few situations where you can uber
[271.13s -> 276.54s]  a heavy or quick fix a heavy and you can get the job done with the quick fix. But with
[276.54s -> 280.94s]  any other situation, you really do need an uber to push into a room like this and that's
[280.94s -> 284.98s]  what I suggest. Once you get to the point where you go, okay, there's a sentry in that
[284.98s -> 289.92s]  room, we have to do something about it. That's when you take out the regular medigun, leave
[289.96s -> 295.56s]  the critskrieg in its closet for now because as we all know, crits do no extra damage to
[295.56s -> 299.24s]  buildings. So if you get critskrieg, if you're a soldier, you're still going to do normal
[299.24s -> 304.09s]  soldier rocket damage to those buildings. But the quick fix is for, let me try and put
[304.09s -> 309.24s]  this this way. If you are one medic on a team, like I said, the quick fix is the medigun
[309.24s -> 313.56s]  to use when you're having trouble, when you're trying to keep people alive, they won't stay
[313.56s -> 318.76s]  alive. The quick fix is the medigun to use in those situations. It's very situational,
[318.76s -> 322.92s]  yes, but it's not bad. It is not terrible and if there's a medic on your team using
[322.92s -> 327.64s]  it, try not to bash him and tell him, hey, twitch to a better medigun because really
[327.64s -> 332.81s]  he might be just trying to solve that situational problem. So just have fun with whatever item
[332.81s -> 338.77s]  you want to play with, whether that be medic or whether that be pyro, demo man, anything.
[338.77s -> 342.65s]  There really is no perfect loadout. That's why they add so many of these items into the
[342.65s -> 349.28s]  game. So just have fun, I guess is my real point of this whole spiel. Spiel, I love that
[349.28s -> 353.30s]  word. So anyways, guys, this is going to be the end of the video. Thank you so much for
[353.30s -> 359.56s]  watching. I really do appreciate it and I'll see you guys all soon. So take care, everybody.
