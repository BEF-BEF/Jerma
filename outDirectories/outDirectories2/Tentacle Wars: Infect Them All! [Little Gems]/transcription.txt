[0.31s -> 12.63s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a new Little Gem.
[12.63s -> 17.87s]  This week's Little Gem is going to be one of my absolute favorite Flash games of all time.
[17.87s -> 25.30s]  The name of the game is Tentacle Wars. It is sort of a hybrid between a strategy puzzle type game.
[25.30s -> 28.30s]  I guess you could say that. It fits in the same category if you guys have ever played the game Risk.
[28.30s -> 35.30s]  It's got that hostile takeover vibe to it, where the point of the game is you have to take over the entire board.
[35.30s -> 39.30s]  Well, not really the whole board, but we will get into the basics of the game right now.
[39.30s -> 43.61s]  Also, really, really quickly, I'm going to leave a couple of links in the description.
[43.61s -> 49.61s]  Not only to the iTunes store where you can download the game, but also to the original Flash versions.
[49.61s -> 55.61s]  Because essentially, this iPad and iPhone Tentacle Wars is a reworking of the first two games.
[55.61s -> 61.42s]  Tentacle Wars 1 and Tentacle Wars The Purple Menace. So they will be there in the description.
[61.42s -> 67.42s]  So the basic premise of Tentacle Wars is to try and infect and overtake the other enemy pods.
[67.42s -> 70.42s]  You do this by shooting out your limbs, I guess you could call them,
[70.42s -> 74.42s]  which, when they're attached, will start slowly draining the enemy's health.
[74.42s -> 79.42s]  It's a war of attrition, and the strategy really lies in knowing when and where to attack.
[79.42s -> 84.42s]  And the enemies can fight back, too. It's not just you don't just destroy people by attacking them.
[84.42s -> 90.42s]  It results in a tug of war, and whoever can last the longest and keep their point count higher is going to win the fight.
[90.42s -> 97.11s]  You can also cut off your tentacles, and it causes this immediate burst damage, and it's incredibly effective.
[97.11s -> 101.11s]  And it's a great strategy, especially knowing if the enemy's almost out of health,
[101.11s -> 106.11s]  and you slice that cord, and it just sucks all into their pod, effectively destroying them.
[106.11s -> 110.11s]  So that's a big part of the game. That's something that you should be doing more often than not.
[110.11s -> 115.80s]  So let's talk about the numbers that are on the pods. It might be a little bit confusing,
[115.80s -> 119.80s]  and I don't blame you if you are confused by this game, because it is quite weird.
[119.80s -> 125.80s]  It's unlike anything I've ever played before. But once you get it, and you understand the mechanics and the mathematics of it all,
[125.80s -> 129.80s]  it is incredibly addicting. But before I go off on a tangent about how awesome the game is,
[129.80s -> 132.80s]  let's talk about, like I said, the numbers and the health.
[132.80s -> 139.42s]  So all these pods are going to regenerate if they're untouched, or if they're being reinforced by a friendly pod.
[139.42s -> 143.42s]  You can put your tentacle on a friendly target. It does not have to be an enemy.
[143.42s -> 148.42s]  This is an integral, insanely important part of this game, because keeping your cells fed
[148.42s -> 155.42s]  by creating these chains to increase the regeneration, you're essentially sacrificing the health of one pod
[155.42s -> 162.42s]  to feed another, if that makes any sense. And remember, all tentacles can be cut to make this process faster.
[162.42s -> 168.42s]  So it's all about this overtime healing and knowing when to put your tentacle on an enemy and make a chain,
[168.42s -> 173.42s]  and it's just so strategic, and especially because there are neutral pods in the game.
[173.42s -> 177.42s]  You're not just going to be always fighting the red team, or the blue team, or the purple team.
[177.42s -> 183.42s]  There are empty gray pods that when you infect them, they don't do any bite back. They don't fight you back.
[183.42s -> 188.42s]  You just have to infect them. You get a large amount of cells in the pod.
[188.42s -> 194.42s]  So knowing when to go after the neutral ones or how to reinforce them, I've had so much fun with this game, guys.
[194.42s -> 199.42s]  I have three-starred almost all the levels. I think there's only one or two that I have not.
[199.42s -> 206.66s]  But the point still remains here that this is my favorite Flash game ever of all time, and I'm so glad to see it on the iPad.
[206.66s -> 214.66s]  The only issue I have with the iPad port is that it's a little bit on the expensive side for the content that you get,
[214.66s -> 218.66s]  seeing as how you can play this game completely for free online.
[218.66s -> 225.90s]  The game is $2.99 for the HD version and $0.99 for the regular, just standard version.
[225.90s -> 231.90s]  Also, really, really important, you cannot play the HD version if you have an iPhone currently.
[231.90s -> 239.40s]  So hopefully the developers will work on that and get us an HD version for iPhone, but you can still get the standard DEF.
[239.40s -> 246.40s]  With all that said, you're going to get 40 levels of content, and the developers have promised that they were going to give more level packs
[246.40s -> 252.40s]  and included support for more devices and all that great stuff. So hopefully we get to see that.
[252.40s -> 256.40s]  So I am going to highly recommend you download this game. If you've never seen it before, you've never played it before,
[256.40s -> 263.40s]  you're going to get at least three or four hours of content because there is an online multiplayer through the Game Center,
[263.40s -> 266.40s]  I believe it is on the iPad. So there is a lot of stuff to do.
[266.40s -> 270.40s]  Now this is not one of those games that you're going to have to come back to 25 times,
[270.40s -> 274.40s]  but it is a great experience that I think you really should have.
[274.40s -> 280.40s]  So with that, thank you so much for watching this little review, little gem of the game Tentacle Wars,
[280.40s -> 284.40s]  and I will see you guys all next time. And of course, take care, everybody.
