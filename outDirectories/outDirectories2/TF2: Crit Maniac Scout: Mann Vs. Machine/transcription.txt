[0.31s -> 14.13s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[14.13s -> 20.13s]  Gonna be covering something on the Man vs. Machine update, something that I've been having a lot of fun with the last couple of hours.
[20.13s -> 22.63s]  And I had to just make a video on it because it is just so goofy.
[22.63s -> 26.63s]  It is a certain particular setup you're going to run with as the scout.
[26.63s -> 33.50s]  The choice of Scattergun is not really the big issue here. What is the issue is making sure you have the sun on a stick.
[34.00s -> 38.50s]  The Bonk Atomic Punch, I was just doing some testing with it, so that is not anything to be concerned with.
[38.50s -> 43.00s]  Just the sun on a stick, and I guess the Baby Faces Blaster will talk about that.
[43.00s -> 48.68s]  If you saw on the previous screen, I had the movement speed increased. I had it by 20% at that time.
[48.68s -> 56.68s]  I tried to get it to 30% to negate the downside of the Baby Faces Blaster. As we all know, it makes you slow down by 35%.
[56.68s -> 63.18s]  So having that enabled, you will negate the minus 35%. Well, you're still gonna have minus 5% movement speed.
[63.18s -> 66.68s]  But you'll move around somewhat normally as a scout with the Blaster.
[66.68s -> 74.11s]  But the reason why you have this thing on is to get the crazy, crazy running speed to use the sun on a stick.
[74.11s -> 79.61s]  Now, I need to be very clear about this. You can only do this setup if there is a Pyro on the team.
[79.61s -> 87.11s]  If there is no Pyro on the team, then you're sort of wasting a melee slot and wasting precious upgrades and money as well.
[87.11s -> 91.78s]  But if there is a Pyro on the team and you want to try this, I absolutely recommend you do this.
[91.78s -> 100.78s]  So what you are going to do is you're gonna pick the sun on a stick, go over to its upgrade center, and just jack up its swing speed.
[100.78s -> 105.96s]  And as you see here, I am swinging so fast right now, I don't even know how fast this is going.
[105.96s -> 109.46s]  And like I said, if there's a Pyro on the team, here's part two.
[109.46s -> 115.46s]  Once he lights people on fire, and as you know in this game mode, people bunch up really, really crazily.
[115.46s -> 126.46s]  These robots come in big, huge waves. So if they're all on fire, you use the movement speed from the Baby Faces Blaster and you just start smashing people.
[126.46s -> 130.26s]  Now, this is incredibly effective in two very specific ways.
[130.26s -> 135.26s]  The number one way is if you buy an Uber Canteen. That's one of the big, big things.
[135.26s -> 142.76s]  If you have a couple of Uber Canteens on you, wait till the Pyro lights one of these big, giant heavies or big, giant soldiers on fire.
[143.26s -> 149.76s]  Use the Uber Canteen and just sit there swinging away, critting the absolute crap out of somebody.
[149.76s -> 155.26s]  It is so fun, it is so goofy, and you actually are going to be doing a pretty substantial amount of damage to somebody.
[155.26s -> 159.26s]  It does about 240 damage a second when this is all utilized.
[159.26s -> 165.76s]  But the second reason why you use this thing is if your team is really pushed back and you're at the final little defense there,
[165.76s -> 168.26s]  and everyone's all scared and everyone's all bunched together,
[168.26s -> 172.76s]  because you can just kneel down like you're seeing me do on the screen, swinging wildly.
[172.76s -> 175.76s]  And if people get lit on fire, they're just going to come in and insta-die.
[175.76s -> 179.26s]  It is a great last resort. It's a great way to find yourself.
[179.26s -> 183.26s]  Just, don't kill me, don't kill me, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[183.26s -> 184.94s]  It's awesome. It's a lot of fun.
[184.94s -> 190.44s]  And that's the really cool thing about this mode. This is what excited me when I first saw all these upgrades, all these things.
[190.44s -> 194.94s]  There is a lot of different options here, guys. People are going to find just crazy things.
[194.94s -> 200.94s]  Oh, you know, what if you use the direct hit, the Righteous Bison, and the shovel?
[200.94s -> 203.44s]  There's a lot of cool things people are going to come up with.
[203.44s -> 208.44s]  I was actually talking to Boo about a certain thing he wanted to try, which is the Crusader's Crossbow.
[208.44s -> 211.94s]  Just max out the attack speed, max out all the stuff on it.
[211.94s -> 216.44s]  So it's just a rapid fire heal hurt gun. And it's just, that's the stuff I love.
[216.44s -> 220.44s]  I love having those kind of conversations with people, love hearing about different cool setups and stuff.
[220.44s -> 224.44s]  So in the comments section of this video, leave me an interesting setup,
[224.44s -> 228.94s]  whether it's certain amount of attack speed, certain amount of buffs, just leave me a cool setup.
[228.94s -> 233.44s]  I want to see what you guys have to say. Maybe I will try some of them out as the time goes on here.
[233.44s -> 237.81s]  And speaking of items and speaking of character customization and all that jazz,
[237.81s -> 243.81s]  I want to bring up in the last video I said that you can upgrade every single item in the game, and that is just not true.
[243.81s -> 248.31s]  There is actually a few items that you cannot upgrade, but most of the items you can.
[248.31s -> 251.31s]  Just wanted to clarify that for you guys, and that's going to wrap up the video.
[251.31s -> 254.31s]  So thank you guys so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[254.31s -> 258.31s]  And I will see you guys all next time. And of course, take care, everybody.
