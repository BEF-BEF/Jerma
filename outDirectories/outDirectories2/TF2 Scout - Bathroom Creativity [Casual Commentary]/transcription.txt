[0.31s -> 14.08s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[14.08s -> 22.38s]  And tonight, gonna be playing as the Scout with the Default Scout Gun and a bunch of other stuff that's in the other slots.
[22.38s -> 25.38s]  But anyways, guys, we're gonna talk about a couple things here.
[25.38s -> 29.38s]  Not really to do- Oh, I just burped in my side of my head.
[29.38s -> 33.38s]  You ever do that? You ever like burp inside your head while you're talking and you like-
[33.38s -> 36.38s]  Especially in a conversation with somebody. Can I just talk about this for a second?
[36.38s -> 42.69s]  When you get in a conversation with someone and you like burp in their face but you try so hard not to do it
[42.69s -> 47.69s]  and you have that face and you put your chin down and you're like, yeah, I'm not a fucking alien.
[47.69s -> 50.69s]  I hate that. And that just happened. Good thing you didn't see my face.
[50.69s -> 53.69s]  Anyways, I wanna talk about creativity.
[53.69s -> 60.18s]  I wanna talk about how to stay creative, how to stay motivated, and how I do it myself.
[60.18s -> 65.18s]  Because obviously this channel, this whole YouTube thing, is me just sort of expressing myself
[65.18s -> 70.18s]  and expressing my views and trying to make you guys laugh, trying to have fun and games with some friends.
[70.18s -> 75.42s]  This whole thing can be shaped around how I feel about creativity.
[75.42s -> 80.86s]  And right off the bat, we're gonna talk about the most important thing I see when it comes to being creative.
[80.86s -> 83.10s]  And it's not forcing it to happen.
[83.10s -> 85.46s]  I get PMs and comments sometimes, people asking me,
[85.46s -> 88.46s]  Jerma, where do you come up with these ideas for videos?
[88.46s -> 92.46s]  How do you come up with these ideas? How do you come up with these voices and characters?
[92.46s -> 98.94s]  And really, it's just things that just happen while you're playing a certain game or while you're doing a certain thing
[98.94s -> 100.94s]  or while you're writing a certain song.
[100.94s -> 102.94s]  Never force creativity.
[102.94s -> 107.12s]  It has to come to you. It has to come like a eureka effect.
[107.12s -> 110.12s]  Not the wrench, like the light bulb, like Edison.
[110.12s -> 113.12s]  It has to come to you and it has to really show itself.
[113.12s -> 117.12s]  And if it doesn't show itself, you have to let it. You can't force it.
[117.12s -> 121.12s]  There's been a million times, guys, I can't even tell you the amount of times
[121.12s -> 124.12s]  where I've wanted to make something, I've wanted to create something,
[124.12s -> 126.12s]  and I just can't do it.
[126.12s -> 129.12s]  And I'm sitting there at my desk and I'm going, damn it, man.
[129.12s -> 132.12s]  I want to make this idea work. I want to do this. I want to do that.
[132.12s -> 134.42s]  But I just can't do it right now.
[134.42s -> 136.42s]  Take a step back and take a break.
[136.42s -> 138.66s]  Take a step back and take a break.
[138.66s -> 141.66s]  Because you're gonna be in bed that night or two nights later,
[141.66s -> 143.66s]  and your eyes are gonna open. You're gonna go,
[143.66s -> 147.22s]  yeah, Bob Dylan needs to ride a T-Rex into the sun in the future.
[147.22s -> 150.22s]  That has to happen. Like, bang, I got it.
[150.22s -> 153.78s]  And I'm not just talking about things that, you know,
[153.78s -> 155.78s]  are mostly associated with creativity.
[155.78s -> 159.78s]  Like, you know, writing songs and writing screenplays and making videos.
[159.78s -> 162.78s]  You can take this into any type of situation
[162.78s -> 167.09s]  where there's some type of thought process that has to go into it.
[167.09s -> 170.39s]  You can take this process into test-taking in school.
[170.39s -> 172.39s]  Don't just sit there and stare at your screen
[172.39s -> 174.70s]  while you're trying to learn about, like, biology.
[174.70s -> 177.19s]  Go look at a fucking frog.
[177.19s -> 179.19s]  There's tons of them out by the pond.
[179.19s -> 182.62s]  Skip some rocks. Talk to some birds.
[182.62s -> 184.80s]  Make a big, write in a diary.
[184.80s -> 186.80s]  I don't know. Does anybody keep a diary anymore?
[186.80s -> 188.80s]  Probably not. Maybe you do. But if you do, then that's good.
[188.80s -> 190.80s]  But you understand, right?
[190.80s -> 193.23s]  Let it come naturally. Don't force it.
[193.23s -> 196.23s]  Because when you force it, that's when you get pissed.
[196.23s -> 199.23s]  And when you start to get angry, anger leads to hate.
[199.23s -> 201.23s]  Hate leads to suffering.
[201.23s -> 203.23s]  Suffering leads to therapy.
[203.23s -> 205.23s]  Leads to Antarctica.
[205.23s -> 209.23s]  Whatever that little green guy says in Star Wars.
[210.23s -> 212.23s]  This has been a very strange video.
[212.23s -> 214.23s]  I'm just, like, ranting all over the place.
[214.23s -> 216.23s]  But really, though, we're gonna move on to point number two.
[216.23s -> 218.23s]  If there even was a point in this video, then listen up.
[218.23s -> 222.05s]  The best way you can come up with some ideas.
[222.05s -> 225.05s]  And I'm not kidding. This is not a joke.
[225.05s -> 227.05s]  Don't take this as a joke.
[227.05s -> 229.48s]  It's gonna sound like a joke, but don't take it as that.
[229.48s -> 231.98s]  In the bathroom.
[231.98s -> 234.22s]  When you are in the bathroom taking a dump,
[234.22s -> 238.22s]  that is, like, the best place to ever come up with any ideas
[238.22s -> 240.22s]  or any problem-solving.
[240.22s -> 243.22s]  Do you wanna know why there's a statue of that guy,
[243.22s -> 246.22s]  the thinker, sitting down with his fist on his chin?
[246.22s -> 248.22s]  He's taking a dump. He's on the can.
[248.22s -> 251.22s]  There's no doubt in my mind that that guy was sculpted
[251.22s -> 253.84s]  inside of his bathroom.
[253.84s -> 257.84s]  You can't find a better place that is a private setting
[257.84s -> 259.84s]  for just complete personal thought
[259.84s -> 261.84s]  than when you're on the bathroom doing your business
[261.84s -> 263.84s]  or when you're in the shower.
[263.84s -> 265.84s]  And the shower is another great one, guys.
[265.84s -> 267.84s]  If you're ever trying to figure out something or do something
[267.84s -> 269.84s]  or, damn it, I wish I could just come up with something,
[269.84s -> 272.84s]  get in the shower, turn the heat up a little bit.
[272.84s -> 274.84s]  Don't get it too hot so you get, like, hurt.
[274.84s -> 276.84s]  But turn the heat up a little bit, get a little bit of steam
[276.84s -> 279.84s]  in that room, and just breathe it in and just relax.
[279.84s -> 281.84s]  And you'll come out of that shower, you'll shake your hair
[281.84s -> 282.84s]  or whatever, and you'll be like,
[282.84s -> 284.84s]  holy shit, E equals MC squared.
[284.84s -> 285.84s]  I did it.
[285.84s -> 289.40s]  But in all seriousness, it really does help.
[289.40s -> 292.40s]  I know there's probably some psychological reason
[292.40s -> 295.58s]  why we feel very comfortable in our bathrooms.
[295.58s -> 297.58s]  And it has to be said, it definitely has something to do
[297.58s -> 300.58s]  with the privacy and nobody can really come in
[300.58s -> 302.58s]  and you can lock the door and just kind of chill out in there
[302.58s -> 303.58s]  for a little bit.
[303.58s -> 304.58s]  It's something to do.
[304.58s -> 305.58s]  I don't know.
[305.58s -> 306.58s]  If you're a psychologist, let me know.
[306.58s -> 307.58s]  But that's gonna wrap up this video, guys.
[307.58s -> 310.58s]  Just a quick little sort of a rant, but not really.
[310.58s -> 313.58s]  I don't even remember how this video started.
[313.58s -> 314.58s]  All I know is I'm here now.
[314.58s -> 316.58s]  So thank you all so much for watching.
[316.58s -> 317.58s]  I really do appreciate it.
[317.58s -> 320.58s]  And get those problem-solving creative minds going on the can.
[320.58s -> 321.58s]  Telling you.
[321.58s -> 323.94s]  See you guys all next time.
[323.94s -> 324.94s]  Take care, everybody.
[324.94s -> 326.57s]  Get out!
