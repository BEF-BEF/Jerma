[0.31s -> 22.15s]  Here comes the huntsman. Here comes the huntsman. I am the huntsman. I will shoot you in the face.
[22.15s -> 27.65s]  Get out of here, spy. Yeah. What do you know? What do you know about that? Shpee.
[27.65s -> 35.70s]  What do you know about that one? Shpee. What do you know about that one, Shpee?
[35.70s -> 37.70s]  That's a triple kill.
[37.70s -> 38.70s]  And spies?
[38.70s -> 43.70s]  No, no, no, no, no, no. Get out of here, Shpee.
[43.70s -> 46.26s]  I got him. At least I got the Shpee.
[46.26s -> 60.05s]  Hey, medic. How are you? Hey, spy. Time to singumentary. You want me to singumentary right now?
[60.05s -> 65.05s]  Do you understand what a singumentary is? You know what? Just get... Both of you guys are just done.
[67.18s -> 84.05s]  You see that headshot. You see that headshot. Just two in a row. Make it three in a row. Make it four in a row.
[84.05s -> 86.48s]  Actually, was that four in a row? I don't even know.
[86.48s -> 102.14s]  Get that headshot, girl. You gotta play. Team Fortress 2 is on its way. Got Star in the call and he's playing ten million. What is he doing that for?
[103.14s -> 106.14s]  I gotta beat this because you beat it. I feel like less of a man.
[106.14s -> 112.30s]  Come on. Are you sure you don't want to have two default snipers sitting in spawn AFK?
[112.30s -> 116.98s]  I'm sure. I want them there. I told them to stay there.
[116.98s -> 121.98s]  Are you sure that you want to have two default snipers sitting AFK in spawn?
[121.98s -> 127.48s]  Yeah, I told them to stay there. We need them there. What if they start spawn camping us?
[127.48s -> 131.56s]  Yeah, what if?
[131.56s -> 135.58s]  Oh, I'm on the red team. Toadman.
[135.58s -> 137.75s]  Hey, you made it. You made it on the team?
[137.75s -> 138.75s]  Toadman.
[138.75s -> 142.38s]  Oh, great. Where are you? Oh, hi, Toadman. Hi.
[142.38s -> 147.01s]  You want to high five me? Fine. Here's a high five.
[147.01s -> 149.01s]  I've never seen this joke before.
[149.01s -> 156.94s]  You're ruining this whole game. You're going to be. No, this is it.
[156.94s -> 163.44s]  No, with me again.
[163.44s -> 168.15s]  The I blew up joke. I don't want to see that again.
[168.15s -> 169.15s]  You're going to see it again.
[169.15s -> 174.95s]  No, I'm not. Because it's three, two, one, go. Go.
[174.95s -> 178.95s]  This scout is so toast. Damn it. I said that so preliminarily.
[190.78s -> 192.78s]  Wow. Is this mad, Jerma?
[192.78s -> 196.45s]  No. Is this what it's like when you're mad, Jerma?
[196.45s -> 198.45s]  Because you're mad right now.
[198.45s -> 201.20s]  You mad right now?
[201.20s -> 204.85s]  All right, come here.
[204.85s -> 207.85s]  Come here. I want you to go as fast as possible.
[220.39s -> 222.39s]  That sounded like a little kid.
[222.39s -> 232.70s]  I want to get up top, but we can't get up top.
[232.70s -> 236.38s]  Here, come with me. Come with me. You ready to come with me? You ready to come with me?
[236.38s -> 238.38s]  Don't whip me. I might blow myself up.
[238.38s -> 240.38s]  No, don't. If you blow yourself up right now.
[240.38s -> 243.38s]  Watch out for this stupid scout dickhead.
[243.38s -> 246.38s]  Oh, look, you got to spawn. Who cares? Let's go.
[246.38s -> 249.38s]  Let's go left, left, left, left, left, left, left, left. We're doing a flanking maneuver.
[249.38s -> 251.38s]  Do you know what that means? Have you ever been to school?
[251.38s -> 256.63s]  You're way faster than me. Hold on. Come here. Come here. Hit detection.
[256.63s -> 259.58s]  Rocket jump. Rocket jump.
[259.58s -> 261.58s]  That's a spy scout. That's got to be.
[261.58s -> 266.06s]  Do you like that sick rocket jump, rocket jump, kill?
[266.06s -> 271.66s]  Here we go. Center down. Center down. Center down. Make it happen.
[271.66s -> 276.89s]  What are you playing, Pyro? I'm a sniper.
[276.89s -> 278.89s]  I was just walking with you just with me.
[278.89s -> 281.89s]  I don't remember my memory. I have a memory of an elephant.
[281.89s -> 286.18s]  Reverse. There's going to be a scout coming up here.
[286.18s -> 288.18s]  What? No, he's going to kill me. No, I'm going to get.
[288.18s -> 301.80s]  I'm going to get panned. Oh, do you shut up?
[301.80s -> 308.86s]  Shut your mouth. I'm not talking.
[308.86s -> 316.16s]  I got him to 150. You see that 150? No, did you see that 150?
[316.16s -> 324.55s]  But we were moving on.
[325.55s -> 331.61s]  Oh, your day. Shit.
[331.61s -> 338.43s]  Did you see that 150? Yeah, on me. That guy 150'd me.
[338.43s -> 341.93s]  Did you see that 150? Did you see that 150?
[341.93s -> 345.45s]  Star, I have a really serious question for you.
[345.45s -> 350.22s]  Did you see that 150? I'm going to soil my diaper.
[350.22s -> 353.22s]  I'm a baby. I soiled my baby diaper.
[353.22s -> 360.50s]  There's a spy behind you. What? You are such a troll.
[360.50s -> 363.50s]  I really thought. I seriously thought.
[363.50s -> 367.25s]  No, no, seriously behind you now. Shut up.
[367.25s -> 371.96s]  No, are you serious?
[377.45s -> 379.45s]  I'm checking everybody because of this.
[379.45s -> 389.24s]  I have a feeling that you are just being a dick weed right now.
[389.24s -> 392.93s]  Yeah, you totally are.
[392.93s -> 394.93s]  There's a scout running at slower speed.
[394.93s -> 397.93s]  I wonder if he's like a spy. He's got like the pistol out.
[397.93s -> 402.71s]  I don't know. I just heard.
[402.71s -> 406.08s]  I seriously heard the dead ringer. I'm not kidding.
[406.08s -> 410.66s]  Got to be the most obvious spy, not spy you can be.
[410.66s -> 413.93s]  Can I get a heal too? Could I get. Could you heal me?
[413.93s -> 416.94s]  Please God.
[416.94s -> 419.11s]  There's a health kit down here.
[419.11s -> 421.29s]  Yeah, it's a little tiny shitty one.
[421.29s -> 424.29s]  Oh my God, you're the worst.
[424.29s -> 427.23s]  This guy's going to die because of you.
[427.23s -> 429.60s]  Did you see what you've done? Did you make it down there?
[429.60s -> 431.35s]  Do you see what you've done?
[431.35s -> 434.23s]  Okay, I'm going in.
[434.23s -> 438.22s]  What do you mean you're going in?
[438.22s -> 440.40s]  I'm going in. I'm not going in.
[440.40s -> 441.83s]  I need health.
[441.83s -> 446.93s]  Yeah, it would be great if I got that health too.
[446.93s -> 460.33s]  This guy actually did it.
[461.33s -> 462.33s]  Watch out, crits.
