[5.88s -> 9.38s]  You are standing in paradise right now, Frank.
[9.38s -> 14.50s]  Simply take a look around. Do you see anything besides pure beauty?
[14.50s -> 16.88s]  Would you ever sell it?
[16.88s -> 18.88s]  Oh, no. Absolutely not.
[18.88s -> 22.99s]  Everything you see here is all for my boy.
[22.99s -> 30.66s]  It blows my mind. How does it taste this good?
[30.66s -> 34.66s]  Well, you don't learn something unless you teach it, in my opinion.
[34.66s -> 38.66s]  I've been working at the same place, Los Santos University Wine Studies,
[38.66s -> 44.56s]  for the past 25 years. And counting, let's hope.
[44.56s -> 48.06s]  Mom saw those guys outside again. It's the third time this week.
[48.06s -> 51.06s]  I'll handle it. Just stay inside.
[51.06s -> 57.24s]  This is my vineyard! This is my recipe! You're not going to take it!
[57.24s -> 58.74s]  You hear me?
[58.74s -> 66.08s]  You don't understand. It's not just good. It's the best.
[66.08s -> 71.45s]  We want that wine.
[71.45s -> 73.95s]  That's not for sale.
[73.95s -> 77.64s]  What? No, Jeffrey, get down!
[77.64s -> 79.64s]  Dammit! No!
[79.64s -> 85.18s]  Oh, you bastard! You son of a bitch! Who did this?
[87.18s -> 98.06s]  Did he receive our message?
[98.06s -> 102.94s]  I'm going to need a favor.
[102.94s -> 106.44s]  You're trying to do this all by yourself? That's crazy talk. What do you need?
[106.44s -> 109.44s]  I think you know what I'm going to do, Tom.
[109.44s -> 117.30s]  They tried to kill my son. They torched the very thing that I've put my entire life into.
[117.30s -> 121.16s]  You want this vineyard? Come and get it.
[121.16s -> 126.16s]  But I warn you, I have a very special set of skills like the guy from Taken.
[126.16s -> 132.32s]  I want him dead, and I want his family dead too!
[132.32s -> 135.32s]  You have no idea who you're dealing with.
[135.32s -> 139.76s]  You want to bring a fight to me? Now that was a big mistake.
[139.76s -> 141.76s]  I beg to differ.
[141.76s -> 145.57s]  They're not going to stop until they get what they want.
[145.57s -> 151.37s]  If I have to go through every single one of them, so be it.
[151.37s -> 156.93s]  Wine is complicated. Life is complicated.
[156.93s -> 159.93s]  Do you have the right ingredients? Do you have the right time frame?
[159.93s -> 164.93s]  Are you ready to start your winery? Are you ready to start your life?
[164.93s -> 171.24s]  Write that down, because yes, it will be on the test.
