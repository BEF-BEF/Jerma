[4.47s -> 11.03s]  Look, that IP is for Upward. I hope you- welcome to Upward. You're on your way to Upward!
[11.03s -> 13.42s]  And when you get on Upward, join Red.
[13.42s -> 17.70s]  Please be Upward. I have my fingers- no!
[19.14s -> 20.26s]  It's Asteroid!
[20.26s -> 26.70s]  I knew that was the joke, but deep down, I wanted to believe that this wasn't gonna happen.
[26.70s -> 30.17s]  You wanna do a 1v1 like the good old times?
[30.17s -> 31.45s]  You wanna 1v1 me?
[31.45s -> 35.83s]  Yeah, I do. I wanna 1v1 you as Demo Knight.
[35.91s -> 39.83s]  And this will decide who is the true reign supreme pizza.
[39.83s -> 42.87s]  This decides who eats the most pizza, okay?
[42.87s -> 48.42s]  Whoever wins this 1v1 duel eats the most pizza and we can finally settle it, okay?
[48.42s -> 51.62s]  Okay, because we haven't been able to figure that out since, I don't know.
[51.62s -> 55.78s]  We've been in massive arguments about who eats more pizza and I think it's me.
[55.78s -> 61.85s]  Did that not even hit you?
[62.74s -> 67.14s]  Did I say you could use- did I- did I- did- are you breaking the rules already?
[67.14s -> 68.58s]  I said Demo Knight.
[68.58s -> 69.14s]  I'm breaking-
[69.14s -> 71.78s]  Just wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I didn't even mean to pick that health up.
[71.78s -> 73.86s]  Just hold- oh, it's so funny!
[78.39s -> 79.51s]  All right, you ready?
[79.51s -> 80.97s]  Yeah.
[80.97s -> 83.22s]  So, I challenge you to a duel.
[83.22s -> 86.15s]  Challenge you to a duel. Demo Knight only.
[86.15s -> 88.71s]  No, like an actual duel. Like, you should accept.
[88.71s -> 91.27s]  I don't- I don't have notifications turned on.
[91.27s -> 92.79s]  So press like J or I or something.
[92.79s -> 96.07s]  That wasn't even you. I didn't even kill you. I like just-
[96.07s -> 97.91s]  See, that's why I was trying to-
[97.91s -> 101.27s]  It just hit J. Did it work? Oh, yeah, yeah, it worked. See ya.
[101.83s -> 104.31s]  Did I- did I win?
[107.58s -> 109.82s]  All right, I see you. All right, all right, you know- you know the drill.
[110.54s -> 113.34s]  Come, uh, not over there. Come over where I am.
[114.58s -> 115.86s]  Okay, I'm coming at you.
[115.86s -> 118.66s]  Follow- follow your teammates. Watch out for this guy.
[119.22s -> 119.94s]  Go up here.
[120.66s -> 123.38s]  Up- okay, perfect spot. There's a Demoman up here, but it's okay.
[127.02s -> 128.70s]  Hey. All right, so in the meat-
[135.37s -> 136.41s]  Why are we doing this?
[136.41s -> 136.91s]  Yes.
[138.39s -> 138.87s]  It's gonna-
[139.75s -> 142.07s]  All right, where are we going? Where are we going instead?
[142.63s -> 145.59s]  Did you get it? Are you out here? Are you coming?
[145.59s -> 146.87s]  It's that simple, buddy.
[146.87s -> 149.48s]  All right. There is a, uh-
[150.44s -> 153.08s]  Okay, your whole team is coming out at the moment. We need to-
[154.44s -> 155.48s]  Go over to the right.
[155.48s -> 158.76s]  You know, like the right where you can go down and drop to where the health pack is?
[158.76s -> 159.32s]  Yeah.
[159.32s -> 162.52s]  Go down there. That's where we're gonna do our duel.
[162.52s -> 164.52s]  That's where we're gonna do our back-to-back duel.
[165.56s -> 167.24s]  Ten paces, just like-
[173.51s -> 177.02s]  Nice. Nice. You come over here as a soldier?
[177.02s -> 181.50s]  Yeah. I thought it would be a nice duel to show the duality of man.
[182.46s -> 184.30s]  Why are you using the- Why are you doing-
[184.30s -> 185.98s]  The War Update? Remember the War Update?
[185.98s -> 187.18s]  No, no. This- No.
[187.18s -> 190.30s]  And whoever wins this duel gets the gunboats.
[190.94s -> 193.19s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on a second. What did you just say?
[193.75s -> 195.51s]  Whoever wins this gets the gunboats.
[195.51s -> 197.67s]  Whoever wins this gets the item, the gunboats.
[197.67s -> 198.07s]  Yes.
[198.07s -> 200.23s]  Get me out there quick. Are you serious?
[200.87s -> 202.07s]  I get gunboats. I gotta get them.
[206.20s -> 208.28s]  Okay. Please go demo.
[209.08s -> 209.56s]  I am.
[213.78s -> 216.82s]  You haven't changed. You have not changed yet.
[216.82s -> 218.58s]  Come here. I think you can-
[218.58s -> 220.26s]  Yo, I'm not gonna change. Yeah, I'll show you.
[220.26s -> 223.14s]  I'm getting those gunboats. I want them and I'm getting the pizza.
[223.14s -> 224.74s]  I'm- Hold on. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[224.74s -> 226.18s]  Back up, back up, back up, back up, back up.
[227.37s -> 228.33s]  Do not screw this up.
[233.93s -> 234.97s]  I'm winning the duel.
[235.93s -> 239.50s]  You want to see what we do? He thinks he's so funny.
[239.50s -> 241.50s]  Oh yeah. Laugh it up. Laugh it up.
[242.22s -> 244.84s]  I'll show you how funny it is.
[244.84s -> 246.36s]  He thinks he's so goddamn funny.
[246.36s -> 248.20s]  You think you're such a comedian, don't you?
[248.20s -> 249.64s]  You think you're so funny, don't you?
[251.08s -> 256.20s]  Rage heavy, rage heavy, rage heavy, rage heavy.
[258.36s -> 259.88s]  So it's like an old school duel.
[260.52s -> 263.80s]  Like back in the old times, like get a vintage ambi.
[263.80s -> 265.08s]  Okay. Where are we doing this?
[265.08s -> 266.68s]  Where are we going to have like a minute over?
[266.68s -> 268.20s]  You know what? It's probably over here by like the-
[268.20s -> 269.40s]  Way, way far behind the spawn.
[269.40s -> 273.56s]  I'm just going to cloak through and die because I have the kunai.
[273.56s -> 275.00s]  So just cloak and dagger through.
[275.00s -> 282.46s]  We're going to go all the way back to this gray gravel door.
[282.46s -> 283.10s]  Gray gravel?
[283.90s -> 286.62s]  It says old geezer, draft beer.
[286.62s -> 288.38s]  Oh, that sounds pretty good.
[288.38s -> 291.66s]  And you're not going to do an MLC stealth and shoot me as I walk there.
[291.66s -> 294.70s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[305.14s -> 307.94s]  If only you could aim, you would have completed the joke.
[309.00s -> 310.92s]  It's time for the duel.
[310.92s -> 313.80s]  Don't do it. I made the stupid mistake.
[313.80s -> 314.84s]  You don't have to make it again.
[315.78s -> 319.54s]  Okay. So we're going to go back to George Washington times.
[320.90s -> 329.48s]  Okay. That's what happened to George Washington.
[329.48s -> 330.12s]  Back to back.
[330.76s -> 332.92s]  We're going to do 10 paces. Okay.
[332.92s -> 334.36s]  Okay. So right here.
[334.36s -> 338.76s]  So I would start like right here and you just hit W one, two, three.
[338.76s -> 342.28s]  So turn, turn, turn around, make sure you're turned.
[342.28s -> 344.07s]  And now we're going to do 10 paces.
[344.07s -> 344.87s]  Are you ready? Okay.
[344.87s -> 346.55s]  Yes. Ready.
[346.55s -> 349.13s]  Yeah. One, two, three.
[353.11s -> 355.83s]  You can't bullshit a bullshitter, buddy.
[355.83s -> 357.11s]  I knew you were going to do it.
[358.23s -> 359.43s]  I just wasn't prepared.
[360.39s -> 362.95s]  You turned around on two or three.
[362.95s -> 364.87s]  We both were at fault on that one.
[364.87s -> 367.88s]  Were you just waiting the whole time for me to turn?
[367.88s -> 368.38s]  Yes.
[369.56s -> 371.72s]  You weren't even honorable at all.
[371.72s -> 374.04s]  I didn't even do the first turn.
[377.00s -> 378.36s]  Can we do a real one?
[378.36s -> 378.92s]  Yeah. We're going to do.
[378.92s -> 380.20s]  We're going to do a real one.
[380.84s -> 382.04s]  Turn. I want to see you turn.
[382.04s -> 383.72s]  I look, I want to turn.
[383.72s -> 385.56s]  We're going to turn at the same time.
[385.56s -> 388.50s]  Okay. I'm going to turn and you're going to shoot me.
[388.50s -> 389.70s]  We all. Okay. We only have 30 seconds.
[389.70s -> 391.30s]  Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.
[391.30s -> 392.90s]  I'm going to trust that you're turned as well as I am.
[392.90s -> 394.26s]  So you're ready? 10 paces.
[394.26s -> 395.86s]  Hit W 10 times. Ready?
[395.86s -> 402.10s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
[405.74s -> 406.94s]  That was very stressful.
[406.94s -> 407.66s]  I got to say.
[407.66s -> 408.38s]  I hit a wall.
[410.41s -> 412.01s]  Here. You, you go on that side.
[412.01s -> 412.97s]  I'm going to go this way.
[412.97s -> 414.33s]  Yes. You go that way.
[414.33s -> 417.50s]  So turn. Okay.
[417.50s -> 418.78s]  I, I'm not turned right now.
[418.78s -> 420.22s]  I just want to make that very clear.
[420.22s -> 422.06s]  So you don't think that I'm trying to screw you up.
[422.06s -> 423.42s]  I just wanted to make sure that.
[423.42s -> 424.62s]  Okay. Turn, turn.
[424.62s -> 425.26s]  Okay. We're both turned.
[425.26s -> 425.98s]  Ready? Yeah.
[425.98s -> 433.51s]  Five paces. One, two, three, four, five, son of a bitch.
[434.23s -> 436.20s]  Son of a bitch.
[437.62s -> 438.58s]  New dual. No, no, no.
[438.58s -> 439.78s]  New dual, new dual.
[439.78s -> 442.50s]  Okay. Are you now turned?
[442.50s -> 443.62s]  I'm, I'm trying to bump into you.
[443.62s -> 444.74s]  I'm making sure you're there.
[444.74s -> 445.30s]  Yes.
[445.30s -> 445.94s]  Okay. You're there.
[445.94s -> 446.74s]  Okay. Yeah.
[446.74s -> 448.10s]  Okay. Make sure we're like, boom.
[448.90s -> 450.42s]  Count to five, turn.
[450.42s -> 451.78s]  We're having a real duel.
[451.78s -> 452.82s]  Okay. Count to five.
[452.82s -> 454.26s]  We're having a real duel this time.
[454.26s -> 454.74s]  Count to five.
[454.74s -> 455.62s]  Are you ready?
[455.62s -> 456.12s]  Yes.
[456.98s -> 458.81s]  Ready? Go.
[458.81s -> 459.21s]  Yes.
[459.21s -> 463.21s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[464.54s -> 466.54s]  Are you shitting me right now?
[466.54s -> 468.54s]  Are you fucking serious right now?
[468.54s -> 469.66s]  You put on Uber.
[471.59s -> 474.71s]  Out of all the things you could have done.
