[0.50s -> 7.48s]  What do you want to do? You want to go out there? Are you sure you want to go out there right now?
[7.48s -> 16.20s]  All right, how about this? We're we're all going out there. Curtin, get out of the way.
[16.20s -> 22.73s]  Fun in the sun, baby. Haven't seen sunshine in like three days. Oh, this is gonna be fun.
[22.73s -> 35.58s]  You want to go outside and play? You want to put the bun on your fat body?
[35.58s -> 39.10s]  The bun that like can't even go across your whole body because you're too fat?
[44.47s -> 48.33s]  Yeah, I got my hat. Yeah, you can't, well you can't be talking out here with me.
[48.57s -> 55.99s]  What? I just walked into the door. Why did you do that?
[59.61s -> 64.49s]  I kind of look like a dickhead right now too. Look at this. Come on, let's go. Come on, boo boo.
[66.41s -> 71.45s]  All right, can I be completely honest here? It's so bright out right now because the sun is shining
[71.45s -> 76.25s]  on the snow. There's laser beams shooting into my eyes. That's like how bright it is right now.
[77.30s -> 81.70s]  I don't need all these clothes. I can't even see anything going on on the camera right now.
[81.70s -> 85.78s]  I do not need all these clothes on. I probably look like such a dipshit to all the neighbors.
[86.34s -> 90.50s]  I could be out here in a sweatshirt. Like I'm ready to go like in the snow.
[95.69s -> 98.97s]  God, I look like an idiot. Otto, Otto, I like this little path I got for you.
[100.42s -> 114.10s]  Oh, look at this. This is so like hopeless. Oh no. Come on, Otto. You can do it. Come to me.
[115.86s -> 119.72s]  All right, well while you do that, let's see how boo boo's doing over there.
[121.90s -> 142.73s]  Hey, boo boo. You almost made it. Otto. Oh, come on. Oh, you can make it. I'm so overdressed right now.
[143.45s -> 147.24s]  Hey, boo boo. All right, I want to show you guys something because this is like,
[148.34s -> 155.22s]  this, dogs for some reason are obsessed with snowballs. For instance, ready, watch my dog.
[155.22s -> 160.26s]  Watch how crazy he gets when he finds out that I have a snowball in my hand. Ready? Look at this.
[160.26s -> 166.50s]  Oh, yeah. Oh, look. They love them. Oh, now he's like, wait, what happened to the magic ball? Oh,
[166.50s -> 175.02s]  jeez. What are you doing? What the hell was that? What, dude, why did it, did somebody just light
[175.02s -> 182.42s]  like a match under your ass? Like what the hell were you doing? Little Otto. All right, we're
[182.42s -> 187.48s]  going to play catch the snowball in your mouth. I figured it was going to be freezing. It's like,
[187.48s -> 193.94s]  it's like 70 degrees out right now. Some blizzard. No, this is like the day after. So a lot of the
[193.94s -> 198.74s]  snow has started to melt already, but I wanted to get out here. I wanted to do some like dog tricks.
[199.30s -> 206.50s]  We're going to do it right now. Dog tricks. Who wants to catch a snowball? Do you want one boo boo?
[206.50s -> 214.58s]  Here. Ready? Yay. See how crazy he just got? He just like almost tried to bite this out of my hand.
[214.58s -> 219.78s]  I told you when dogs see a snowball, they go nuts. Try it on your dog. If you've got a dog,
[219.78s -> 225.53s]  make a snowball. He won't even care until you go like this. That's pretty cool. So again,
[225.53s -> 232.36s]  ready? Watch this. Hey boo boo, boo boo. Look at, I got like nothing in my hand. Hey, ready? Crazy.
[232.36s -> 242.01s]  He's crazy now. Now he's insane. All right. You know what? I'm just going to go do like a front
[242.01s -> 259.14s]  flip into the snow right now. Hey, don't try this at home. Go get hurt. Oh, somebody help me. He's,
[259.70s -> 266.31s]  please. He needs your help from the two dogs. Oh, I'm sorry. I just made you do that.
[266.95s -> 278.50s]  Are you all right? He's stuck. Just get out of here. See you guys later. Don't do that at home.
[278.50s -> 283.67s]  You'll die instantly. Crazy.
