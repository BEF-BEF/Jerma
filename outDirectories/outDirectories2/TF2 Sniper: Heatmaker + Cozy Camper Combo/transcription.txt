[0.31s -> 19.70s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm going to be playing as the Sniper with the Heatman's Hitmaker.
[19.70s -> 27.94s]  What the Hitman's Heatmaker? Why did I mess that up? And the Cozy Camper and the Shahanshah.
[27.94s -> 33.94s]  So what I want to talk about in this video, I want to talk about this combination right here, the Heatmaker and the Cozy Camper.
[33.94s -> 39.94s]  It is an incredible setup, and I'll go into why I use it, why I think it's good, and that sort of thing.
[39.94s -> 47.18s]  First and foremost, I want to talk about the Cozy Camper buff, and what it means to snipers everywhere. It's a very good thing.
[47.18s -> 54.35s]  So if you missed my video from a week ago, or if you missed the buff in general, the Cozy Camper now regenerates 1 health every second.
[54.35s -> 60.35s]  Now it may seem like it's doing 2 health a second, but if you really do the counting, it's just giving you 2 health in 2 seconds.
[60.35s -> 64.35s]  So if you look in the lower left and you're like, wait, why does it say 2? That's the reason why.
[64.35s -> 70.53s]  Now the question you might be having is, Jerma, why do you like this thing so much now? And here is the number 1 reason.
[70.53s -> 77.70s]  As a Sniper, you pretty much, well as a Scope Sniper, let me rephrase that, you stay back and you stand still.
[77.70s -> 81.70s]  You move around maybe a little bit, you go to a different spot, you'll hang out over there, hang out over there.
[81.70s -> 85.70s]  But for the most part, you are standing kind of still shooting your Sniper rifle.
[85.70s -> 91.70s]  This allows you to heal for a medium health pack in 60 seconds.
[91.70s -> 98.70s]  Or 63 to be exact, because a medium health pack does 63 health for a Sniper. That doesn't have the Darwin's Danger Shield.
[98.70s -> 100.94s]  So let's go back to what I was talking about.
[100.94s -> 105.94s]  If you are standing still as a Sniper, and you don't want to move, and you're confident that you're not going to get shot at,
[105.94s -> 112.94s]  you don't have to go looking for a health pack anymore. You don't have to go scouring the map looking for a medium health or a small health pack.
[112.94s -> 118.94s]  Especially if you're above 50% health, you will heal that back in like 20 to 30 seconds.
[118.94s -> 121.94s]  That's not that much time if you really think about it.
[121.94s -> 125.94s]  Also, I didn't even think about this until I put it on and got sprayed by a Pyro.
[125.94s -> 127.94s]  This is the anti-afterburn.
[127.94s -> 133.94s]  There's been at least a few cases since the update launched where I've been lit on fire and should have died,
[133.94s -> 136.94s]  but I had the Cozy Camper on and it negated a lot of the afterburn.
[136.94s -> 139.94s]  So that alone is reason to put this thing on.
[139.94s -> 146.31s]  So now I want to talk about the Heatmaker and the Cozy Camper and why they are a match made in heaven.
[146.31s -> 149.55s]  So as we all know, the Heatmaker uses the new mechanic of focus.
[149.55s -> 155.55s]  When you shoot somebody with a full focus bar, it's going to start to drain the bar and you can stay scoped in.
[155.55s -> 157.55s]  Now think of the Camper.
[157.55s -> 163.55s]  The Camper allows you to not flinch when you are shot and reduces knockback to your character.
[163.55s -> 164.55s]  Now imagine this.
[164.55s -> 170.55s]  You get into focus and you are uninterruptible by anything besides maybe a compression blast.
[170.55s -> 175.55s]  This whole time, you are scoped in and don't have to scope back out.
[175.55s -> 180.55s]  This allows you to only rely on your aim and nothing else.
[180.55s -> 183.55s]  You're not going to be knocked back. You're not going to be flinched.
[183.55s -> 185.55s]  You're not going to have to reload, come back, zoom back in.
[185.55s -> 189.55s]  It's just a game of how many people in the head you can shoot.
[189.55s -> 190.55s]  It's ridiculous.
[190.55s -> 195.79s]  Now you aren't totally invincible. In fact, you're very vulnerable because spies can take you down.
[195.79s -> 198.79s]  Of course, scouts. I mean, you've already seen a scout kill me from behind already.
[198.79s -> 203.79s]  So you're not invincible, but it really helps with your aim and really helps with your concentration.
[203.79s -> 207.79s]  You just need to hope that your other teammates are keeping people away from you.
[207.79s -> 213.16s]  And if you want my thoughts on the Heatmaker, my general impressions on this weapon and what I think about it,
[213.16s -> 216.16s]  I think this is the best sniper rifle in the game right now.
[216.16s -> 219.16s]  I actually never really liked the Makina because of the no-no scope.
[219.16s -> 225.16s]  I couldn't get over that because I would be in so many situations where I'd want to no-scope somebody I wouldn't be able to.
[225.16s -> 231.40s]  And the only downside to the Heatmaker is just the minus 20% damage to body shots.
[231.40s -> 234.40s]  That's a pretty big downside, but at the same time, you've got to remember,
[234.40s -> 238.40s]  most snipers are going to be aiming for your face, not for your chest.
[238.40s -> 244.40s]  And it does the same amount of damage as any of the other sniper rifles, except, of course, the Makina fully charged.
[244.40s -> 247.40s]  So it's, I mean, the body shot thing is not that big of a deal.
[247.40s -> 251.58s]  If you want to balance this weapon a little bit, or if you would think about a nerf for this weapon,
[251.58s -> 255.58s]  in my opinion, take away the 25% faster charging.
[255.58s -> 258.58s]  Because what that does, that makes it better than the Bazaar Bargain.
[258.58s -> 261.58s]  That does what the Bazaar Bargain is supposed to do.
[261.58s -> 268.58s]  I think if you get rid of that and you make the damage penalty on body shots a little bit higher, maybe 25% or 30%,
[268.58s -> 272.58s]  I think then you have a very good sniper rifle that's balanced with all the other ones.
[272.58s -> 274.88s]  We'll see what Valve does.
[274.88s -> 277.88s]  They're always changing things. They're always making little tweaks to the items.
[277.88s -> 279.88s]  We shall see.
[279.88s -> 283.25s]  But in the meantime, that is going to wrap up the video, guys.
[283.25s -> 286.25s]  Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[286.25s -> 287.25s]  And also, I want to bring this up.
[287.25s -> 293.25s]  Yesterday, my Facecam Fortress 2 video, I don't think made it all the way through publishing and got to everybody's sub boxes,
[293.25s -> 297.25s]  because I had at least a few people tell me, I didn't even see this. What the hell?
[297.25s -> 299.42s]  So if you missed it, it's going to be in the description.
[299.42s -> 303.42s]  The link will be there to yesterday. It is a Facecam Fortress 2 video.
[303.42s -> 307.42s]  And I do apologize, guys, because YouTube is always screwing things up with the sub boxes.
[307.42s -> 310.42s]  And if you've been missing videos, I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do about it.
[310.42s -> 312.42s]  And I wish there was something I could do.
[312.42s -> 316.60s]  But whenever it's very evident that a video has not gone all the way through publishing,
[316.60s -> 319.60s]  I will just put an announcement on the tail end of another video like this,
[319.60s -> 322.78s]  just letting you guys know in case you happen to miss it.
[322.78s -> 324.95s]  But again, thanks for watching. That's going to be it.
[324.95s -> 326.95s]  And I'll see you guys all next time.
[326.95s -> 328.95s]  So take care, everybody.
