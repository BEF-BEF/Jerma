[0.31s -> 11.98s]  I'm gonna play actual spy and like try to be spy.
[11.98s -> 19.78s]  Okay. And I'm gonna bake-stab this guy. What?
[19.78s -> 24.65s]  Oh, what was that? You wanna get bake-stabbed? Bake-stabbed?
[24.65s -> 28.36s]  You wanna get bake-stabbed? Is that what you want? What about you, Heavy? I don't want that.
[28.36s -> 34.00s]  You wanna get friggin' bake-stabbed? I don't. I don't.
[34.00s -> 37.42s]  Got him. Got him. 80. 80, 80. Got him. Okay, jump.
[37.42s -> 43.10s]  80, 80, 80, 80. Bake-stabbed that guy. I'm a soldier on your team.
[43.74s -> 47.94s]  Just come out. Yeah, heal me. Let's go. Vaccinate an uber charge, baby. Let's do it.
[47.94s -> 53.56s]  Oh, what a mistake.
[53.56s -> 57.84s]  I got him both. What a blunder.
[57.84s -> 62.04s]  I feel so bad. I hate when stuff like that happens to me.
[62.04s -> 67.91s]  You're in there. I'm helping the team. I picked medic. Yeah, you just feel like so awful.
[67.91s -> 74.89s]  Let's get on this cot, guys. Come on. Get on. Somebody get on this cot.
[74.93s -> 79.13s]  Anybody. Anybody come on the cot with me. I'm a soldier. They're not doing so
[79.13s -> 85.58s]  peachy keen. Oh, is it? Hey, you got out. Heavy got out.
[85.58s -> 91.08s]  I got out. Man, a sniper. Anybody else? Oh, the same medic.
[91.08s -> 94.52s]  Heal me, dude. Come on. Oh, dude, get the mini sentry. I need your love. Oh, Mike.
[94.52s -> 99.66s]  Oh. Oh, that was not fun. Oh, I don't have enough. Come on,
[99.66s -> 104.37s]  cloak. Hey. You're like, you're not a spy.
[104.37s -> 110.03s]  Guys are standing on the inside of their spawn, disguised as somebody on our team.
[110.03s -> 114.63s]  I am your friend. Yeah, for instance, this guy is a spy.
[114.63s -> 118.90s]  For instance, you want to get backstabbed? What do you want?
[118.90s -> 123.39s]  Oh, that guy didn't want to get backstabbed. Come on, get out of my way, soldier.
[123.39s -> 131.71s]  I don't want to let you to hear me. And no, no, no.
[131.71s -> 138.96s]  Don't kill me. I'm just like somebody on your team spy.
[138.96s -> 141.76s]  What the hell was that? What was he doing?
[141.76s -> 146.90s]  I'll just stand really still. What the hell?
[146.90s -> 151.41s]  All right, well. Oh, God.
[151.41s -> 154.53s]  That was unfair. If I've ever seen a crit rocket, that was unfair.
[154.53s -> 157.71s]  That was up there. Come on, we got to, like, snipe them.
[157.71s -> 161.50s]  I'm going to let them crouching. I'm sniping. I'll lure them out here.
[161.50s -> 165.54s]  I'll just, like, they'll come see me. And there's so many snipers in there.
[165.54s -> 170.83s]  Yeah, I'm one of them. I'm almost out of ammo.
[170.83s -> 172.79s]  Come on. Am I trying to? Yeah.
[172.79s -> 176.38s]  Don't kill me. Get up.
[176.38s -> 183.95s]  Well, that guy knew.
[183.95s -> 190.80s]  Um, now what? Sap Mini Sentry, please.
[190.80s -> 193.92s]  What is this guy? What are these guys doing?
[193.92s -> 195.92s]  I don't know. What is going on right now?
[195.92s -> 198.48s]  What the hell is going on? Should we switch teams?
[198.48s -> 203.79s]  I don't think we can. Dude.
[203.79s -> 205.87s]  All right, let's just go. Can we go on the other team?
[205.87s -> 212.11s]  I wish. I would. I'm just going to stand out here as the spy.
[212.11s -> 214.03s]  I'm not even going to disguise. Oh, turn around.
[214.03s -> 217.28s]  There's so many people out here now. Oh, OK.
[217.28s -> 219.68s]  I think they got killed, though. Never mind. Never mind.
[219.76s -> 224.38s]  Is that a spy? No.
[224.38s -> 231.38s]  Oh, my goodness gracious. I spent way too long taunting that guy.
[231.38s -> 233.30s]  I should have just shot him. He had no help.
[233.30s -> 236.50s]  Do you think this is a game? Oh, I'm joining blue.
[236.50s -> 238.18s]  I'm doing it. I'm doing it. Can we go?
[238.18s -> 240.94s]  One minute left. I want to join, too.
[240.94s -> 245.10s]  Got to turn the tide. You see me? Show me mercy.
[245.10s -> 251.09s]  Or don't. I want to join the other team. I want to get to the first point.
[251.09s -> 256.67s]  All right, get to the first point. I dare you.
[256.67s -> 260.35s]  What on earth? I want to extend this like horrible, horrible match.
[266.06s -> 269.50s]  Good one. I mean, if there wasn't three snipers in a line in our spawn,
[269.50s -> 273.73s]  I think we'd be in a pretty good spot. I want to switch.
[273.73s -> 276.29s]  I want to play, too. I want to go on the other team and try and win.
[276.29s -> 282.16s]  You can't. I know. I really can't.
[282.16s -> 286.45s]  Oh, my God. Where'd that heavy come from? He had to have been invisible.
[288.78s -> 293.57s]  Invisible. Hey, it's like half invisible and half invulnerable
[294.82s -> 302.02s]  and half free to be an American. Screw you.
[303.22s -> 305.38s]  I knew that was you. It was like, who else would do this?
[308.05s -> 314.42s]  Oh, I still can't switch. Oh, I can't do it.
[314.42s -> 318.18s]  There's just so many people walking at me and you hopping around on rooftops.
[319.07s -> 322.83s]  I was playing Fiddler on the roof. I don't know why I had to kill you,
[322.83s -> 325.79s]  but I had to kill you. I think we might get the point.
[327.06s -> 328.90s]  I'm going to make sure that doesn't happen. Here we go.
[330.62s -> 337.65s]  Not going to happen. No, no, you ruined.
[338.53s -> 340.37s]  You really did. You were the only person behind.
[340.37s -> 343.01s]  It's the only person I had to turn around for. It's like right there.
[345.57s -> 348.21s]  Oh, who's this living room sad asshole? Who the hell is that guy?
[349.81s -> 352.13s]  I was like, I was on blue. Suck. We lost.
