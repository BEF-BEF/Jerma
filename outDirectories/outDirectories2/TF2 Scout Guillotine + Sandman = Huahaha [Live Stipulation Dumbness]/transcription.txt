[0.31s -> 13.08s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some Smeep Smoop Smoop.
[13.08s -> 16.52s]  Today, gonna be not killing that spy because it's a real person.
[16.52s -> 23.99s]  Playing as the scout with the cleaver and the ball. The big balls.
[23.99s -> 26.95s]  Uh, what am I doing here? I'm just gonna go for kills with this.
[26.95s -> 34.81s]  And if I get him, I get him, you know? Hey, what's up dude? Oh, damn it. Give me that ball.
[34.81s -> 41.61s]  You prick. I would have had that too.
[41.61s -> 47.05s]  There it is. Get out of town. Get out of town. I'm running circles around you.
[48.09s -> 51.22s]  All right. This guy's dumb too. Ready? I'll get this.
[51.22s -> 56.63s]  No shit. No, don't let him cap it. Get him.
[56.63s -> 63.69s]  What? That was bad. That was real bad. At least I got that guy. That's one.
[63.69s -> 67.94s]  If I don't, I've got to get at least five of those in this video.
[67.94s -> 70.02s]  I don't care if it takes me like two hours.
[73.27s -> 82.52s]  Look buddy. I mean, I don't ask me what the hell this guy's doing.
[82.52s -> 88.18s]  Get it. Bang. Nice. That's two. That makes two.
[88.18s -> 92.34s]  Got to do this at least a few more times until I am satisfied.
[92.34s -> 98.25s]  I have an insatiable hunger to throw this into people's faces.
[98.25s -> 107.08s]  It is my thirst. It's just not... Will you quit jumping around like a freaking jackrabbit?
[107.08s -> 109.88s]  All right. You know what? I'm just going to start shooting you now.
[109.88s -> 113.88s]  I know I'm breaking the stipulation rules, but I have to kill this guy.
[113.88s -> 126.78s]  He is just... Is every single soldier on Hightower a rocket jumping soldier?
[126.78s -> 130.15s]  That is an inquiry. I want to be answered.
[130.15s -> 137.72s]  I feel like every single soldier that's on this map at all times is using the rocket jumper.
[137.72s -> 140.86s]  Like, look it. Even on our team. And this guy's going to burn to death.
[140.86s -> 145.08s]  See you. Nice. Look at... You see the guy just...
[145.64s -> 147.88s]  That guy just rocket jumped over his dead body.
[152.02s -> 156.31s]  Stop rocket jumping!
[156.31s -> 159.91s]  I'm just not going to do it again. I'm just not going to do it against a soldier anymore.
[160.23s -> 162.87s]  There's just no reason to. He's just going to rocket jump, but I'm going to miss him.
[162.87s -> 165.82s]  Look, look. Ready? Oh, I would have missed him. Don't worry.
[165.82s -> 177.40s]  My goodness. That headshot was unbelievable.
[177.40s -> 182.50s]  You get it. You'll get it. Okay. I will give you that one.
[182.50s -> 187.86s]  Everybody gets one. Now you're dead. You're not even there anymore.
[187.86s -> 190.26s]  But yeah, now when you come... Here we go. Here we go. I'll get him.
[191.54s -> 197.54s]  Here we go. Here it is. Sir... He was just...
[198.50s -> 203.99s]  Don't worry. I'll still get him. No, he's going to headshot me.
[203.99s -> 205.75s]  I'm going to get right up close to him.
[205.75s -> 210.18s]  I'm going to try to taunt kill this guy. Actually, you know, you know what?
[210.18s -> 218.62s]  There it is! Just screw you! You took... I had that.
[218.62s -> 222.97s]  I seriously had that. And you took it all away from me.
[222.97s -> 230.34s]  And don't mind me. I just want to go up here and taunt kill this sniper.
[230.34s -> 232.34s]  God damn you. Or I'll do this.
[233.08s -> 237.30s]  Either or. Either or. Neither nor.
[237.30s -> 244.71s]  Give me the health. Give me the health. Give me the health.
[244.71s -> 247.48s]  What the... What am I doing? Why did I just do that?
[247.48s -> 251.34s]  Oh, I'm going to predict your movements because I'm smart.
[251.34s -> 261.94s]  That was the dumbest thing I've ever done. Hey, see you later. Home run.
[264.14s -> 270.70s]  No! No, you fuck. No, I can't believe it.
[272.46s -> 276.73s]  I can't believe it. You...
[285.70s -> 294.54s]  Of course that'll happen. And it didn't kill him, but yes, it did.
[295.26s -> 300.07s]  Oh, Lord. All right. I got it. That makes four.
[300.07s -> 302.70s]  That makes four. I just got to get one more.
[302.70s -> 305.18s]  And I am the victor of this challenge.
[305.66s -> 310.87s]  Just... I want to do that. I want to do that.
[310.87s -> 314.63s]  Hey, look. It's just a scout at the door.
[314.63s -> 317.46s]  That's the noise it has to make.
[317.46s -> 322.02s]  You know, I'm going to be patient here. I'm going to fall off this.
[322.02s -> 325.58s]  Let me be patient. I think I've been spotted.
[325.58s -> 329.18s]  In fact, I'm almost certain I've been spotted by that soldier that's down there. Maybe not.
[329.18s -> 336.28s]  Okay. You may in fact be... I don't know.
[336.28s -> 338.30s]  I'm too afraid to go check.
[338.30s -> 343.83s]  I love how we both have the same idea.
[343.83s -> 348.28s]  Dude, there's been like three snipers up in this roost like the whole game.
[348.28s -> 349.80s]  You tell... Okay. Here we go.
[349.88s -> 351.99s]  He doesn't see me. I wonder how long it's going to take.
[361.27s -> 363.90s]  Don't mind me. I'm just part of the set.
[363.90s -> 368.70s]  I'm set piece scout. That's like what my name is now.
[368.70s -> 372.01s]  Don't let him do it. That's five. That's five.
[374.87s -> 377.11s]  I can't believe I just died from that.
[378.89s -> 382.09s]  What is that? What dog is that? What cartoon dog did I just do?
[382.09s -> 384.25s]  Come on. Come on. Comment section.
[384.25s -> 386.41s]  I need your help.
[386.41s -> 389.13s]  Here we go. I'm going to get one more for good measure.
[389.13s -> 391.90s]  One more for good measure. One more for good measure.
[391.90s -> 395.94s]  Here we go, baby. Nope.
[395.94s -> 399.54s]  Nope. Nope.
[399.54s -> 401.54s]  Nope. Nope.
[401.54s -> 403.05s]  Nope. No.
[413.72s -> 415.64s]  No, don't kill me.
[418.63s -> 425.93s]  What's going on with my neck? Did you see that?
[427.34s -> 431.42s]  My guy was his head was going like, what the... What was that?
[434.98s -> 437.27s]  Outrageous.
[437.27s -> 442.42s]  All right. This is the last life. This is the last life, I think.
[442.42s -> 445.32s]  Give it to me. God damn it.
[445.32s -> 446.76s]  I'm going to keep you in the co...
[446.76s -> 449.72s]  Oh, see, big mistake number one was you doing that.
[457.88s -> 461.98s]  Yeah. All right. The deed is done.
[461.98s -> 463.35s]  Now it's time.
[463.35s -> 467.24s]  No, dude. Come on. Mr. Pyro.
[467.24s -> 468.20s]  Holy shit.
[477.98s -> 479.82s]  I've said this before and I'll say it again.
[481.37s -> 486.12s]  When a bald ass Pyro is looking at you, he's a spy.
[486.12s -> 489.08s]  He just is. That's just the way there is.
[489.08s -> 490.76s]  I can't believe I didn't see through that.
[491.64s -> 493.48s]  I thought it was... Whatever.
[494.90s -> 498.34s]  Let's wrap this up. Let's wrap this up right now, please.
[499.54s -> 505.50s]  Well, thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[505.50s -> 508.54s]  I think I got like five kills, six kills with this thing.
[509.83s -> 512.31s]  No, let me get the fucking taunt kill.
