[0.31s -> 18.70s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm going to be playing as the Soldier with the original.
[18.70s -> 25.70s]  The original, yeah, you probably haven't seen this in a long time. The original, the buff banner, and the market gardener.
[25.70s -> 31.70s]  Now before the video gets started, I do not do any market gardener kills. I don't know why this was even on.
[31.70s -> 38.70s]  I'm pretty sure it's because of the backpack giveaway, and this is like one of the only things left over I had, so I just put it on.
[38.70s -> 44.70s]  I do a couple embarrassing rocket jumps though, if that's what you're wondering, but anyways, let's move on from that.
[44.70s -> 51.06s]  This is going to be one of those casual type videos where I just kind of sit back, relax, and talk about the gameplay, some funny things.
[51.06s -> 54.06s]  There actually is a couple funny things that do happen in this gameplay.
[54.06s -> 58.06s]  And just go over some things that you guys talk about random stuff, you know how it is.
[58.06s -> 61.06s]  Sitting back, relaxing, playing some Team Fortress 2, baby.
[61.06s -> 67.37s]  So let's start now. Let's talk about why I selected the original today or tonight, whatever time it is when you're watching the video.
[67.37s -> 73.37s]  The reason being is because I have found recently that the original works better for me.
[73.37s -> 79.67s]  I can aim way better with the original now than with the stock rocket launcher, and I don't know when this happened.
[79.67s -> 85.67s]  I kind of just put it on for shoots and Googles, as they say, although that's not the correct term.
[85.67s -> 90.91s]  But you know what I'm talking about. I did it just for giggles. I put it on, and that was all she wrote.
[90.91s -> 93.91s]  I started to get more points, started to land more shots more frequently.
[93.91s -> 99.91s]  And I think that middle mechanic, I have a whole video on the original if you haven't seen it, just so you can just search on the channel for it.
[99.91s -> 109.09s]  But that middle mechanic for the rockets coming out of the middle of the screen, I think, at least for me, is a much better direct one-to-one, here's the rocket, there it is.
[109.09s -> 112.09s]  It's coming out of this spot right in front of you, coming out of the front of the screen.
[112.09s -> 120.09s]  I think that's better than the rockets coming from almost over your right shoulder, kind of your right eye has to pick up on it, and you aim accordingly.
[120.09s -> 125.09s]  Just for me, my brain is having an easier time more recently with the original.
[125.09s -> 129.52s]  Also, I want to bring this up. I'm just looking at my window right now, and it's catching my eye.
[129.52s -> 133.52s]  And I want to talk about it, just for like a minute or so, less than that probably.
[133.52s -> 138.52s]  Right now, it is in the halfway between raining and not raining.
[138.52s -> 145.52s]  And I think, like, you know, that misty kind of fog that you get sometimes outside your window, I think this is my favorite type of weather.
[145.52s -> 152.52s]  Now, it might be some weird, that's like pretty depressing, like, oh, I love, it's a beautiful day outside, it's a foggy, awful day.
[152.52s -> 161.70s]  But for some reason, I think this is the most relaxing, best time of the year when it's kind of foggy, not too cold, but it's cold, and you still got to put a jacket on and go outside.
[161.70s -> 168.87s]  I love it like this. I love rain, fall, winter, these two seasons back-to-back, I adore them so much.
[168.87s -> 173.87s]  So let me know in the comments section what you think about that, what your favorite seasons are, and that sort of stuff.
[175.05s -> 178.05s]  But now I want to talk about the gameplay. This is something ridiculous that happens.
[178.05s -> 181.05s]  It happens to me maybe once a month when I play this game.
[181.05s -> 189.40s]  So I blow the horn, get my buff banner crits, come around the corner, shoot this soldier, I gotta slow that down.
[189.40s -> 194.40s]  So I shoot myself in the face, on the wall, because I got popped up by that crit.
[194.40s -> 203.58s]  I do this quite frequently, like I said, whether it's a sticky bomb that I accidentally blow myself up with, shooting myself on a wall with the rocket launcher with a soldier,
[203.58s -> 209.58s]  or even something like jumping off a cliff with any of the classes and just hurting myself to death.
[209.58s -> 215.58s]  I do these things a lot, so I wanted to show you guys, I want to slow it down and do the slow motion replay, baby.
[215.58s -> 217.58s]  Because slow motion, slow motion makes everything funny.
[217.58s -> 225.58s]  I'm not sure if you guys know this or not, but any time you slow something down, it could be like your grandmother telling you her secret recipe for meatloaf.
[225.58s -> 228.58s]  It's going to be funny, like, for instance, let's just try it.
[228.58s -> 243.55s]  So the secret recipe for meatloaf is two cups of delicious meat, two cups of baked potatoes, and then three cups of small strawberries.
[243.55s -> 251.94s]  So with Exhibit A, you can see that slowing things down is not only fun and educational, it's also funny.
[251.94s -> 258.94s]  So that recipe actually sounded pretty good. What was it? Two cups of meat, two cups of potatoes, potatoes.
[258.94s -> 263.94s]  That's my grandmother used to say, potato like bodata. That's why that's coming out that way.
[263.94s -> 267.94s]  Getting rid of that medic right there, the soldier. I get a good shot on this guy.
[267.94s -> 272.94s]  He does a rocket jump and I time it perfectly, but it doesn't kill him. I wish that killed him.
[272.94s -> 276.94s]  If that killed him, I would have felt a lot better about the situation that me and this medic are in right now.
[276.94s -> 283.94s]  We're stuck kind of in this house and doing a whole lot of missing. I don't actually hit any people right here, so this is kind of embarrassing.
[283.94s -> 286.94s]  But let's just jump out of here. I get the assist on that pyro.
[286.94s -> 291.94s]  And coming up in the next like 15 seconds is probably the best part of this entire video.
[291.94s -> 295.94s]  So if you minimized, hey, hey, minimize back up right now. Something crazy is going to happen.
[295.94s -> 300.94s]  This is a testament to how awesome the buff banner really is.
[300.94s -> 303.94s]  Take a look at how many people are going onto the cart right now.
[303.94s -> 310.94s]  I blow the horn, turn the corner, make sure I have enough rockets loaded up, and then hello sweetie.
[310.94s -> 314.94s]  Look at this. I kill almost every single person that was on that cart.
[314.94s -> 318.94s]  Get rid of that guy, get rid of that guy, and that guy, and you know, just for good measure, sorry medic.
[318.94s -> 322.94s]  I couldn't protect you, but it's okay. I get your revenge on that guy.
[322.94s -> 325.94s]  So I get back to that by spy. Of course that happens.
[325.94s -> 332.18s]  But you see, that's how insane that item really is. If you can get a medic on you or a couple people turning a corner,
[332.18s -> 337.42s]  I mean, we still lose the match right here, though don't get me wrong, but that was a complete wipe off.
[337.42s -> 341.42s]  They had like four or five people on that cart and they were all gone because of the buff banner.
[341.42s -> 346.66s]  But that is going to wrap up the video guys, so thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[346.66s -> 351.66s]  And I'll see you all soon. Just another one of these casual commentaries, just chilling back and relaxing.
[351.66s -> 355.66s]  So I'll see you guys all soon, and of course, take care everybody.
