[0.25s -> 11.58s]  Alright Michael, we're here on your special day.
[11.58s -> 14.58s]  That's right, it's my birthday today, not anybody else's.
[14.58s -> 16.58s]  Alright Michael, calm down.
[16.58s -> 21.58s]  Mom, shut up. I get all the presents Cathy doesn't get any because she's an idiot.
[21.58s -> 25.58s]  Come on Michael, you ruin your fucking birthday every year for everybody else and we get it.
[25.58s -> 29.58s]  I went through so much trouble to get you this rat's mixtape. I know how much you like them.
[29.58s -> 32.08s]  Can we just dance together as a family for once?
[32.08s -> 52.40s]  This year I got something new and exciting and different for everybody.
[52.90s -> 53.90s]  Hey kids, it's me.
[53.90s -> 54.90s]  It's a clown.
[55.90s -> 56.90s]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.
[56.90s -> 57.90s]  Get away from me.
[57.90s -> 58.90s]  Please.
[58.90s -> 59.90s]  What the hell is happening?
[59.90s -> 60.90s]  It's a clown.
[60.90s -> 61.90s]  This clown's out of control.
[61.90s -> 62.90s]  Just chill out, everybody calm down.
[62.90s -> 63.90s]  It's my birthday.
[63.90s -> 66.97s]  Everybody calm down, I'm just a clown.
[66.97s -> 69.34s]  Oh whoa man, that clown.
[69.34s -> 72.28s]  Why did you invite him?
[72.28s -> 76.28s]  Rats, we're rats, we're the rats.
[76.28s -> 81.28s]  We play at night, we stalk at night, we're the rats.
[81.78s -> 83.78s]  I'm the giant rat that makes...
[83.78s -> 85.78s]  Hey, wait, hey, wait.
[85.78s -> 86.78s]  I'm stuck.
[86.78s -> 88.78s]  I knew this was a bad idea.
[88.78s -> 89.78s]  I'm stuck.
[89.78s -> 90.78s]  How did you...
[90.78s -> 92.78s]  You're making us late to the birthday party.
[92.78s -> 93.78s]  I'm the giant rat, I make all the rules.
[93.78s -> 95.78s]  You need to help me out of here now.
[95.78s -> 96.78s]  You know, you say that but...
[96.78s -> 100.68s]  No.
[100.68s -> 107.72s]  Hey, happy birthday.
[107.72s -> 109.72s]  Dad, those are rats.
[109.72s -> 111.72s]  Yeah, happy birthday.
[111.72s -> 113.72s]  A special box inside a treat for you here.
[113.72s -> 114.72s]  Thanks for the guy.
[114.72s -> 116.72s]  Thanks for the guy.
[116.72s -> 117.72s]  Bye.
[119.10s -> 120.60s]  Oh, I remember that box.
[120.60s -> 121.60s]  I shit in that one.
[121.60s -> 123.60s]  Oh dad, it's definitely something really cool.
[123.60s -> 127.60s]  A super cool toy that everyone's gonna be jealous of.
[127.60s -> 128.60s]  Hey, what's up?
[128.60s -> 129.60s]  I'm your new best friend.
[129.60s -> 131.60s]  We got a problem.
[131.60s -> 142.91s]  The fat guy doesn't fit y'all in the toilet.
[142.91s -> 143.91s]  Alright, honest opinions.
[143.91s -> 144.91s]  What did you guys think?
[144.91s -> 148.81s]  That wasn't good at all.
[148.81s -> 149.81s]  Yeah, why?
[149.81s -> 150.81s]  That was bad.
[150.81s -> 151.81s]  That was terrible.
[151.81s -> 152.81s]  Well, that's the beauty of this whole thing, son.
[152.81s -> 154.81s]  None of this even matters at all.
[154.81s -> 157.99s]  As a sequel, we're trying to do one very important thing.
[158.49s -> 161.49s]  That's sell toys, sell books, and sell audio tapes.
[161.49s -> 164.49s]  Now the movie itself could be about a blue toothbrush.
[164.49s -> 167.49s]  And as long as we sell the merchandise and keep the suits happy,
[167.49s -> 169.49s]  who cares about the subject matter?
[169.49s -> 172.49s]  But, what if I don't have a suit?
[172.49s -> 178.95s]  Prepare the drop.
[178.95s -> 181.95s]  And please, hit the right target this time.
[181.95s -> 183.95s]  Yes, sir.
[183.95s -> 199.98s]  You don't need to know what I had for breakfast this morning, alright?
[199.98s -> 201.98s]  Just let's talk about the deal.
[202.48s -> 208.90s]  Wasn't there a guy that was just right here?
[208.90s -> 212.70s]  Huh?
[212.70s -> 215.20s]  What's this guy doing here?
[215.20s -> 217.20s]  This might be the pizza delivery guy.
[217.20s -> 220.20s]  Yeah, I'm gonna go get the car and I'm gonna pull it around.
[220.20s -> 221.20s]  Save me a slice.
[221.20s -> 222.20s]  Don't eat the whole thing.
[222.20s -> 223.20s]  I don't know.
[223.20s -> 224.20s]  It might be a pizza.
[224.20s -> 226.20s]  Maybe I press it and I'll get a pizza.
[226.20s -> 227.63s]  Yeesh.
[229.00s -> 230.56s]  I'm going home.
[230.56s -> 231.56s]  I want a chicken nuggets.
[231.56s -> 241.18s]  Oh, what was that?
[241.18s -> 245.00s]  Welcome, Bratikin, to the dog capital.
[245.00s -> 247.43s]  I trust you alright?
[247.93s -> 250.93s]  In that case, walk with me and talk with me.
[250.93s -> 257.26s]  I'm going to show you something that I haven't shown anyone in over two thousand years.
[257.26s -> 259.12s]  What do you see before you?
[259.12s -> 260.62s]  Yeah, a toothbrush.
[260.62s -> 262.62s]  It is a toothbrush.
[262.62s -> 265.62s]  One of the most important in the entire galaxy.
[265.62s -> 267.62s]  Oh, cool.
[267.62s -> 271.62s]  This toothbrush holds the DNA of every single animal on Earth.
[271.62s -> 273.62s]  It must be protected.
[273.62s -> 274.62s]  Yeah, I know.
[274.62s -> 276.62s]  If this would have fallen to the wrong hands...
[276.62s -> 278.62s]  The infiltration was a success!
[279.12s -> 280.12s]  We've been breached.
[280.12s -> 281.12s]  We have been breached.
[282.12s -> 283.12s]  Sound the alarms.
[283.12s -> 284.12s]  We have been breached.
[290.68s -> 291.68s]  What's happening?
[291.68s -> 319.49s]  I've been in a nightmare for two weeks straight.
[319.49s -> 324.74s]  That's a pretty good toothbrush.
[324.74s -> 329.03s]  Now hold on just a second.
[329.03s -> 330.03s]  Pause the movie.
[330.03s -> 331.03s]  Hit pause.
[331.03s -> 335.11s]  Did you hear what they just said?
[335.11s -> 339.11s]  That toothbrush has got the DNA of every animal on Earth.
[339.11s -> 341.11s]  Well, mate, it's just a movie.
[341.11s -> 343.11s]  I don't buy that for a second.
[343.11s -> 344.11s]  You're telling me it's just a movie?
[344.11s -> 346.11s]  Was Finding Nemo just a movie?
[346.61s -> 347.61s]  No, that was a documentary.
[347.61s -> 349.61s]  They had cameras down in the ocean.
[349.61s -> 351.61s]  I've never seen them filming it in Philadelphia.
[351.61s -> 352.61s]  Hang on a second.
[352.61s -> 354.61s]  I'm just going to get up right now because you're fuming me.
[354.61s -> 357.61s]  I'm just saying, we rented this film from Blockbuster.
[357.61s -> 359.61s]  Oh yeah, Blockbuster clothes.
[359.61s -> 360.61s]  Good joke.
[360.61s -> 361.61s]  I'm going to go to the sewer.
[361.61s -> 362.61s]  You coming with me?
[363.61s -> 364.61s]  Well, no.
[364.61s -> 365.61s]  See you later.
[365.61s -> 366.61s]  I mean, you can't...
[366.61s -> 368.61s]  Bloody hell.
[368.61s -> 370.87s]  Nice and easy.
[370.87s -> 372.87s]  You don't want any cops to see us pulling in here.
[372.87s -> 374.30s]  All right.
[374.30s -> 376.48s]  We're going to have to split up for this.
[376.48s -> 377.48s]  A lot of junk.
[377.98s -> 378.98s]  Yep.
[378.98s -> 379.98s]  Tell me if you find anything.
[379.98s -> 381.98s]  I thought I'd be doing real jobs.
[381.98s -> 382.98s]  Robbing banks.
[382.98s -> 383.98s]  Stealing paintings.
[383.98s -> 384.98s]  It's pretty good filler content.
[384.98s -> 386.98s]  I'm waiting through shit to find a dirty toothbrush.
[386.98s -> 388.98s]  This is just to make sure you understand the story.
[388.98s -> 389.98s]  Fucking day off as well.
[389.98s -> 390.98s]  Yeah.
[390.98s -> 391.98s]  None of this even matters.
[391.98s -> 392.98s]  Yeah, it doesn't.
[392.98s -> 393.98s]  Oi!
[393.98s -> 394.98s]  I've got something for you.
[394.98s -> 395.98s]  You found something?
[395.98s -> 396.98s]  Yeah, I got something too.
[396.98s -> 398.48s]  What do you got?
[398.48s -> 400.48s]  Well, it's a blue toothbrush.
[400.48s -> 404.48s]  Yeah, they're fucking everywhere, man.
[404.48s -> 406.48s]  So I'll just grab a couple.
[406.98s -> 407.98s]  You know, we could probably sell these.
[407.98s -> 408.98s]  Get in the car.
[408.98s -> 409.98s]  You know, I've got an idea.
[409.98s -> 411.98s]  I know exactly who we can sell these to.
[411.98s -> 414.98s]  Just put your seatbelt on, because I'm about to step on the gas.
[414.98s -> 421.71s]  I would go to a doctor, but I'm just scared of what he has to say.
[421.71s -> 422.71s]  You know?
[422.71s -> 423.71s]  That's why I asked you about it.
[423.71s -> 424.71s]  That is just grimp.
[424.71s -> 425.71s]  Quiet down here.
[425.71s -> 426.71s]  Let me do the talking.
[426.71s -> 427.71s]  You keep your mouth shut.
[427.71s -> 431.53s]  How we doing this evening, cat police?
[431.53s -> 433.53s]  We don't have time for small talk.
[433.53s -> 435.53s]  Did you bring the product or did you not?
[435.53s -> 438.53s]  Did you get my text by any chance?
[438.53s -> 441.03s]  I have Verizon, so maybe it didn't go through.
[441.03s -> 442.27s]  Enough.
[442.27s -> 445.27s]  The least of your concern should be text messages
[445.27s -> 449.27s]  and how we are about to decimate your disgusting planet.
[449.27s -> 451.27s]  The $20 is what I was told.
[451.27s -> 454.27s]  So you don't get shit unless I see 40 bucks.
[454.27s -> 455.27s]  Not so fast.
[455.27s -> 459.79s]  The rats have told me everything.
[459.79s -> 462.79s]  And if you think that I, Gary, guardian of...
[462.79s -> 465.60s]  This ends now, cat police.
[465.60s -> 467.60s]  What do you have to say about this one?
[467.60s -> 469.60s]  Yeah, it's pretty cool, huh?
[470.10s -> 472.10s]  Now let's see what happens when you fight me.
[472.10s -> 474.10s]  And what I'll win, I'll beat you up.
[474.10s -> 475.60s]  How did you guys sort this out?
[475.60s -> 480.04s]  For centuries we have tried to find the Noah's Ark toothbrushes.
[480.04s -> 482.28s]  And for centuries we have failed.
[482.28s -> 483.28s]  But not tonight.
[483.28s -> 486.28s]  You intergalactic space beings will never win.
[486.28s -> 488.28s]  We will always band together and stop you.
[488.28s -> 490.64s]  At any cost.
[490.64s -> 491.95s]  Such a pity.
[491.95s -> 493.95s]  It's too bad, really.
[493.95s -> 497.12s]  Our DNA would have fused together wonderfully.
[497.12s -> 500.12s]  Now let us show you our true power.
[500.12s -> 503.31s]  Oh, shit.
[508.50s -> 514.00s]  Now witness the power of over 2,000 galaxies come bad.
[516.00s -> 517.50s]  And yours will be next.
[517.50s -> 519.50s]  Evil will never win.
[520.50s -> 522.32s]  Quickly, hero.
[522.32s -> 524.32s]  There's not much time.
[524.32s -> 527.32s]  Take that toothbrush and cast it into the fires about noon.
[531.32s -> 533.32s]  I will hold him off as long as I can.
[534.32s -> 537.37s]  Take that!
[538.55s -> 545.48s]  Maldome.
