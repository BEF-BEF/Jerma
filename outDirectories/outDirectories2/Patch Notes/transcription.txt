[1.08s -> 6.58s]  So I feel a little bit bad that I haven't been covering as many games as I used to on this channel.
[6.58s -> 12.58s]  I used to go over patch notes, game updates, how I felt about them, and I haven't done it in a very long time.
[12.58s -> 18.38s]  So I wanted to play catch-up with myself, in a sense, and go over all of them.
[18.38s -> 23.38s]  All the patches and updates that I wanted to cover that I didn't get a chance to cover over the last three years.
[23.38s -> 25.56s]  So this one's probably gonna be quite a long one.
[25.56s -> 30.06s]  We're gonna go over all these patches and we're gonna start with Team Fortress 2.
[30.06s -> 32.06s]  Team Fortress 2, the invasion update.
[32.06s -> 34.56s]  Get yourself excited. Are you excited? Well, you should be.
[34.56s -> 38.56s]  We're talking about patches here. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the patch video.
[38.56s -> 39.56s]  So Team Fortress-
[42.56s -> 45.06s]  Hey, hey, hey. Whoa, whoa. You're fast-boarding right now.
[45.06s -> 50.06s]  I just wanna make sure your fingers hold. You're doing that intentionally? Is that another mistake?
[50.06s -> 55.56s]  I added a drop-down area to Red's last and adjusted lighting in various areas.
[55.56s -> 59.56s]  What's interesting, though, is they finally fixed the direct deck settings on light poles.
[59.56s -> 61.56s]  Remember how annoying that was with the light pole?
[62.86s -> 64.36s]  Okay, listen, I-
[65.86s -> 68.36s]  I sometimes- you don't have to skip all of Overwatch.
[68.36s -> 70.86s]  That was a pretty big deal of games coming out soon.
[72.86s -> 77.36s]  Look, this video took me like three months to make, so I don't wanna be like a dick about it.
[77.36s -> 81.36s]  But if you could just pick something so I could at least feel like it mattered-
[81.36s -> 83.36s]  There's one for Nazgoth here.
[83.36s -> 88.36s]  Sonic Boom actually finally got the nerf it deserved. It's now under eight seconds for a cooldown.
[88.36s -> 88.86s]  Yep.
[88.86s -> 92.36s]  And they fixed a couple of crashes, the desktop launcher, the crash on exit.
[92.36s -> 94.86s]  Thank God we can now not have to deal with that.
[94.86s -> 98.92s]  And the game will never turn on ever again after May 31st.
[98.92s -> 99.42s]  It's true.
[99.42s -> 100.92s]  Moving right along, we got another patch-
[101.42s -> 104.42s]  No, look. There's no reason for you to go this fast.
[104.42s -> 107.92s]  Okay, I'm just gonna be very frank with you. Take your finger off that button right now.
[107.92s -> 109.92s]  Right now. If you have any respect-
[109.92s -> 111.42s]  The first sin.
[111.42s -> 113.29s]  Why is Dark Souls 2 even on here?
[115.29s -> 118.29s]  I'm just gonna hang out. I'll be over here on my phone.
[118.29s -> 124.79s]  Got a couple new apps to check out. I downloaded FaceSwap. You know, FaceSwap, you can do it with your dog and it's really funny.
[124.79s -> 129.79s]  I got a new keyboard app, too. I'm not sure if you've heard of it. It's called Key. It's up in Key.
[129.79s -> 133.79s]  You can make a little tune, it's pretty bold. I got a couple more games for the tune as well.
[136.03s -> 137.03s]  What the hell is this?
[140.03s -> 141.03s]  Hold on.
[142.03s -> 144.03s]  Pause the video for a second. Pause it!
[145.03s -> 147.34s]  You're in a different video right now.
[147.34s -> 152.08s]  I haven't even made this video yet. You are at least 20 to 30 uploads in the future.
[152.08s -> 155.25s]  So you're going to listen to me very closely and very carefully.
[155.25s -> 161.25s]  You're going to rewind a few months and you're going to stop, okay?
[161.25s -> 163.25s]  Very simple instruction.
[163.25s -> 167.07s]  There you go. Right here, right here. Stop, stop, stop.
[167.07s -> 169.07s]  Doesn't matter where. Stop right here.
[169.07s -> 170.07s]  In fact, you might-
[170.07s -> 171.07s]  In fact, you might-
[171.07s -> 172.07s]  Yeah, I'm overlapping here.
[172.07s -> 173.07s]  Yeah, I'm overlapping here.
[173.07s -> 174.07s]  Pull it forward like two inches or so.
[174.07s -> 175.07s]  On the bar? On the bar?
[175.07s -> 176.76s]  Almost there.
[176.76s -> 177.93s]  Almost there. One more.
[177.93s -> 179.49s]  Got it. Perfect.
[180.36s -> 181.36s]  These are my patch notes.
[181.36s -> 183.66s]  And these just came out today.
[183.66s -> 184.66s]  I haven't even seen these yet.
[184.66s -> 186.97s]  You picked a perfect place to stop.
[186.97s -> 189.21s]  So, let's see what they changed.
[189.21s -> 191.72s]  They're actually shrinking me again.
[191.72s -> 192.72s]  This is the second time it's happened.
[192.72s -> 194.22s]  We should all look for Dermot's current height.
[194.22s -> 196.22s]  He's been causing performance issues.
[196.22s -> 198.22s]  He couldn't easily fit into a clown car.
[198.22s -> 201.22s]  With this change, clown car videos are now much more accessible.
[201.22s -> 204.10s]  I don't want to do clown car videos.
[204.10s -> 206.10s]  What are they talking about?
[206.10s -> 208.10s]  My lumberjack outfit is going to get removed too.
[208.10s -> 210.27s]  No, that is bullshit.
[210.27s -> 212.27s]  I'm keeping my lumberjack outfit on.
[213.14s -> 214.14s]  What else do we got?
[214.14s -> 217.08s]  This patch is fucking terrible so far.
[217.08s -> 219.08s]  40% more vacation vlogs.
[219.08s -> 222.46s]  No, I'm not doing vacation videos.
[222.46s -> 223.46s]  No way.
[223.46s -> 228.08s]  I would rather do 100 clown car videos than one vacation video.
[228.08s -> 232.52s]  So, opting out of this one, as you could say.
[232.52s -> 233.52s]  It's downloading.
[233.52s -> 235.01s]  When did I do that?
[235.01s -> 236.01s]  I didn't press any button.
[236.01s -> 237.01s]  I didn't accept anything.
[237.01s -> 238.01s]  There was no cancel or anything.
[238.01s -> 240.32s]  Nothing's working here.
[240.32s -> 242.56s]  Do I seriously have to rip out my ethernet cable?
[242.56s -> 245.56s]  I do. I don't want this patch.
[246.06s -> 249.11s]  Hold on a second.
[249.11s -> 250.11s]  I had all these installed.
[250.11s -> 252.11s]  I'm connected to my whole damn house.
[252.11s -> 253.86s]  I think that's it.
[253.86s -> 254.86s]  Is it?
[254.86s -> 258.19s]  God damn it!
[258.19s -> 259.19s]  Ow!
[259.19s -> 260.56s]  Ow!
[260.56s -> 262.93s]  That's the cable.
[262.93s -> 263.93s]  I gotta put that back in.
[263.93s -> 265.93s]  I want to watch Better Call Saul season 2.
[265.93s -> 268.64s]  I can't...
[268.64s -> 270.58s]  Hello?
[270.58s -> 275.04s]  Look, you are going to have to call back at a different time.
[275.04s -> 277.22s]  I'm in the middle of some shit right now.
[277.22s -> 278.22s]  And I need...
[278.22s -> 280.46s]  Look, please put me on the do not call list!
[280.46s -> 285.75s]  Fucking asshole!
[286.25s -> 287.25s]  Ah!
[287.25s -> 289.49s]  Your service has been temporarily disconnected.
[289.49s -> 290.49s]  That's not it.
[290.49s -> 291.49s]  I think I might throw up.
[291.49s -> 292.92s]  I hope not.
[292.92s -> 293.92s]  What is this?
[293.92s -> 294.92s]  What is that?
[296.68s -> 298.68s]  Why do I have a sneeze switch?
[298.68s -> 300.68s]  Please leave a message.
[300.68s -> 301.92s]  Please leave a message.
[302.92s -> 303.92s]  This is it, right here.
[304.92s -> 305.92s]  Whoa!
[305.92s -> 307.10s]  Colors!
[307.10s -> 308.85s]  Gone.
[308.85s -> 309.85s]  I can't see anything.
[309.85s -> 311.41s]  I'm blind.
[311.41s -> 312.91s]  I must have pulled out the HDMI.
[312.91s -> 313.91s]  Oh boy!
[313.91s -> 314.91s]  Oh boy!
[314.91s -> 316.21s]  Somebody's gonna have to call.
[316.21s -> 317.21s]  Where's my mom?
[317.21s -> 318.21s]  Where's my phone?
[318.21s -> 319.21s]  Mom?
[319.21s -> 320.21s]  Fuck!
[320.71s -> 321.71s]  How much time do I have on that?
[321.71s -> 322.71s]  I don't know.
[322.71s -> 323.71s]  I can't tell.
[323.71s -> 326.04s]  I can't see.
[327.22s -> 331.02s]  I'm deaf.
[331.02s -> 334.77s]  I don't know if it feels like there's a part of me on this one.
[334.77s -> 340.19s]  This is a weird feeling.
[340.19s -> 342.19s]  I kind of just feel like I don't exist.
[342.19s -> 346.22s]  I can't hear and I can't see.
[346.22s -> 352.78s]  Is there a way I can...
[352.78s -> 354.95s]  I can't come to it.
[354.95s -> 355.95s]  I'm gone!
[355.95s -> 356.95s]  One...
[356.95s -> 357.95s]  Two...
[357.95s -> 358.95s]  One...
[358.95s -> 360.32s]  Three...
