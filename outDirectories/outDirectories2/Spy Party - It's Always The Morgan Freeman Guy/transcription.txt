[0.70s -> 9.10s]  Welcome back to Spy Party. In this episode, we're going to return to the game that-
[9.10s -> 16.40s]  Just making duck noises, that's fine. That's great. Um, we're going to be playing Spy Party again because it was just recently updated.
[20.29s -> 28.42s]  Oh, that looks fancy.
[28.42s -> 31.22s]  There's now an option to complete one known mission. We're going to do that.
[31.22s -> 32.36s]  I only have one-
[32.36s -> 33.06s]  Only one?
[33.06s -> 34.86s]  Yeah, I only have one thing I have to do.
[34.86s -> 36.60s]  That's going to be too easy.
[36.60s -> 40.14s]  All I have to do is- oh, here we go. So look at these new models.
[40.14s -> 44.94s]  And there he is, ladies and gentlemen. The new Monopoly guy.
[44.94s -> 52.62s]  Actually, can I be the old Monopoly guy too? No- what? There's only like four people you can choose from.
[53.99s -> 61.19s]  I wonder which character Jerma picked. There's a guy with a-
[65.16s -> 68.16s]  It wasn't the Monopoly guy. It was me. It's just a lady.
[69.16s -> 76.24s]  This is- that's- there's only five people at this party. What a shitty party.
[76.74s -> 81.80s]  Oh, I had a- I had a party. Do you want to come to my party? Only four people showed up.
[85.00s -> 88.99s]  This is a pretty huge house for like five people.
[103.14s -> 106.14s]  That is so funny. It's like, oh, we have like- look at character model.
[106.14s -> 109.14s]  Animation's like beautiful than like the Muppet in the room.
[111.63s -> 113.63s]  No shit!
[117.87s -> 120.30s]  I was trying to shoot the Monopoly guy.
[125.43s -> 127.43s]  Contact double agent is your only mission?
[128.43s -> 130.43s]  So you're going to win, like easily.
[147.42s -> 149.42s]  I don't know, I just like thought it was him.
[149.92s -> 153.92s]  Look at this comparison. Look at these two faces.
[157.02s -> 163.84s]  So hold on. That one guy that just does not belong, he can't be anything.
[165.65s -> 169.65s]  Literally, I can't make him the ambassador. I can't make him- I can't pick him.
[169.65s -> 174.65s]  That's the point. That's what I'm saying. You know he is completely irrelevant and you shoot him?
[174.65s -> 178.65s]  I didn't know he was like that completely irrelevant. I thought you could at least like pick him or something.
[179.52s -> 187.77s]  So why is he here? Why is this guy here? What is this guy's purpose? Like what purpose does this guy serve?
[195.62s -> 200.05s]  I love how Morgan Freeman has a cane. Why does Morgan Freeman have a cane?
[203.05s -> 208.05s]  He's not that old. Is that his wife like standing right next to him? Oh, he's planting the bug on him.
[208.55s -> 215.92s]  Whoa, look out. This is fucking impossible by the way.
[215.92s -> 222.30s]  There's only four people in this room. How the hell are you- you're going to see me do this every time?
[222.30s -> 228.46s]  I don't know. I'm kind of not paying that much attention right now to be honest with you.
[228.46s -> 233.47s]  What? You're paying attention to like the guy over here?
[235.77s -> 239.93s]  That's you, isn't it? You know what gave you away?
[239.93s -> 240.93s]  What?
[240.93s -> 247.56s]  You tapped your key like once and your character shifted like, and I was like, dude, they don't do that.
[248.06s -> 252.06s]  Okay, he was the like new Monopoly guy. Big surprise, Jerma.
[252.06s -> 261.24s]  We're gonna do- we're gonna do something here. Because there's only five people in this room and one of them does not matter at all in the slightest.
[261.24s -> 270.10s]  I'm going- there's like a 20% chance- no, 25% chance that I'm going to kill you instantly.
[270.10s -> 276.70s]  Damn it, you're fucking Morgan Freeman again!
[276.70s -> 282.28s]  You're not catching on to this. This is like the same thing from the first video.
[282.78s -> 287.94s]  I will keep that in mind, that it's always Morgan Freeman.
[287.94s -> 289.94s]  Well, no, see, this is where I metagame you.
[289.94s -> 294.20s]  No, you're not going to metagame me. I already know what you're doing.
[294.20s -> 301.28s]  You see, oh, it's always Morgan Freeman, but no, no, no. You see, you're not going to pick Morgan Freeman now.
[301.28s -> 306.28s]  You're going to be like Cruella De Vil from 101 Dalmatians. Game over, I win.
[306.28s -> 310.05s]  I told you-
[313.28s -> 319.77s]  Alright, no, no, it's still the old models. It's still the old models when you go back to like the other missions.
[320.27s -> 322.27s]  Well, it's open bay today. Today's a good day to do it.
[322.27s -> 325.34s]  Oh yeah, this has been a great experience.
[325.34s -> 333.94s]  Great experience, Jerma. I'm glad I got to play this game with you again.
[335.94s -> 338.43s]  I just couldn't wait to do this.
[346.13s -> 349.75s]  You want to go again? Just do a few more of these?
[349.75s -> 355.40s]  Yes, I want to do- I want to do another one.
[355.40s -> 357.40s]  I want to go back to this one again.
[357.40s -> 359.96s]  One mission.
[360.46s -> 364.73s]  I want to do-
[364.73s -> 366.97s]  Alright, let's go.
[366.97s -> 371.34s]  You and me. Baby, it's on now.
[372.34s -> 375.16s]  Do you want to just keep doing this?
[376.16s -> 382.89s]  I don't understand. Why do you think I would know what you're doing here?
[382.89s -> 387.76s]  Are we done?
[391.79s -> 392.79s]  Yeah.
[392.79s -> 394.96s]  Okay, good.
[394.96s -> 399.96s]  Wait, the guy who doesn't finish is scratching his head on my screen like, what?
[400.46s -> 402.46s]  Morgan Freeman again.
[402.46s -> 404.46s]  That was so stupid.
