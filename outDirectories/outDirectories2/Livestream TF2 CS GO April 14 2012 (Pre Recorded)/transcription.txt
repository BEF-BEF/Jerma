[0.76s -> 13.09s]  Hi. Hello everyone, German985 here. Just kidding. Hello everyone, German985 here.
[13.09s -> 21.44s]  Oh well, you can't lie to them like that. What's up guys? Did anyone believe it?
[21.44s -> 26.16s]  No one's even here to hear it, so. Yeah, there is like
[26.16s -> 30.30s]  15-20 people already here. Oh, you're on Twitch. My bad.
[30.30s -> 35.89s]  I am on the Twitch-itch. Anyways, happy Saturday.
[35.89s -> 40.51s]  Happy Sunday if you are from a different country. And let me
[40.51s -> 47.31s]  shout this out to people. Actually, I gotta write
[47.31s -> 55.55s]  at MLC Stealth. Oh, come on.
[55.55s -> 59.41s]  Hold on, what? How come I can't bring up Brett
[59.41s -> 63.65s]  as like an at mention? Maybe he like blew up his Twitter.
[63.65s -> 69.37s]  MLC Stealth. Wait, can I not even do you either?
[69.37s -> 74.77s]  What is going on here, Twitter? Twitter, what is going on?
[74.77s -> 83.73s]  Why are you being like this? I'm gonna tweet too. You could retweet what I tweet.
[83.73s -> 88.69s]  We can all tweet. You can pick your nose. You tweet, I tweet.
[88.73s -> 95.37s]  But you can't pick your friends' nose. We all tweet for JermaStream.
[95.37s -> 106.62s]  With at MLC. Okay, that was weird. I don't know why it didn't work before.
[106.62s -> 115.02s]  I wonder who that is. And tweet.
[115.02s -> 120.61s]  No, no tweet. Don't tweet yet. I already tweeted.
[120.61s -> 125.05s]  Oh, no. Oh, no, no. I was talking to myself, not to you.
[125.05s -> 128.25s]  I was telling myself, because I was gonna hit the Twitter button,
[128.25s -> 136.24s]  and I didn't even put the link, so I was like, no, no. It has been twittered.
[136.28s -> 140.20s]  And yes, it has. There's Twitter.
[140.20s -> 148.89s]  Now I'll go to YouTube and post that.
[148.89s -> 154.96s]  And then get out of there, because it's not necessary.
[154.96s -> 165.91s]  And Saturday Stream. Okay, good evening.
[165.91s -> 169.83s]  We're gonna play some Team Fortress 2, and then, if you guys don't know,
[169.83s -> 173.53s]  they just put out a huge, huge CSGO update.
[173.53s -> 177.92s]  So that should be interesting to check out, for sure.
[177.92s -> 184.29s]  It's like one of the biggest, they've added like, they had like five maps.
[184.33s -> 189.46s]  I would love to express my enthusiasm for that, but alas, I cannot.
[189.46s -> 194.86s]  You don't have it. I don't have it, no.
[194.86s -> 202.80s]  Oh, wow. Yeah, I think they're gonna, it's, release is coming soon.
[202.80s -> 212.46s]  I think it's coming soon. Otherwise, the update today was pretty huge, so.
[212.46s -> 216.86s]  You know Valve, though. It's gonna be months, probably.
[216.86s -> 220.54s]  Yeah, yeah, true. Very true.
[220.54s -> 223.65s]  Good evening, everyone. All of you that are saying good evening.
[223.65s -> 228.22s]  I bid you good morrow and good tidings.
[228.22s -> 229.82s]  So let's get rolling.
[229.82s -> 235.79s]  MLC Stealth is here, but he's currently, he's currently in the bathroom.
[235.79s -> 238.78s]  And that's all we're gonna say about that.
[238.78s -> 245.58s]  So let's, we're gonna find a server that is empty.
[245.58s -> 248.88s]  Do we need to wait for him before we join a server so that he can play?
[248.88s -> 251.16s]  Ah, yeah. He's gonna have to deal with it.
[251.16s -> 253.62s]  Oh, there you go. There he is.
[253.62s -> 256.81s]  Perfect timing, sir. Thank you.
[256.81s -> 262.59s]  I was waiting for the right moment to enter, and that one seemed pretty good.
[262.63s -> 265.64s]  No, I was watching clips from the Ellen DeGeneres show.
[265.64s -> 267.24s]  Why, why are you doing that?
[267.24s -> 270.78s]  She's funny. Sorry, I'm late.
[270.78s -> 274.61s]  You're supposed to be in the stream.
[274.61s -> 279.26s]  Now let's get into this server. Let's try and find a 32. Here we go.
[279.26s -> 285.96s]  CP Badlands. Eh, I don't know if I wanna do CP Badlands.
[285.96s -> 290.11s]  This is 28. That's 2-4. That's trading.
[290.11s -> 293.31s]  Oh, here we go. That's 2 out of 24.
[293.31s -> 294.61s]  Alright, you guys ready?
[294.61s -> 295.77s]  Uh, not quite yet.
[295.77s -> 296.61s]  Oh, you better hurry up.
[296.61s -> 297.69s]  I'm, I'm launching it.
[297.69s -> 299.29s]  It's already on that screen. It's already on.
[299.33s -> 302.17s]  I'm already, I've already got Xbox connected, my console.
[302.17s -> 303.57s]  Ready to go.
[303.57s -> 305.69s]  Wait, couple seconds.
[305.69s -> 309.09s]  Oh, by the way, if you guys may, everyone knows who Stealth is,
[309.09s -> 311.17s]  but some people may not know who you are, Italics.
[311.17s -> 313.44s]  Go ahead and give an introduction.
[313.44s -> 317.60s]  Hey guys, my name is Italics, and I make YouTube videos.
[317.60s -> 319.44s]  And my channel name is Gamers Descent,
[319.44s -> 322.80s]  which you may know me by instead of Italics.
[322.80s -> 324.69s]  That is where I hail from.
[324.69s -> 329.60s]  Yeah, you come from the mountain top of Gamers Descent.
[329.60s -> 332.24s]  What time is it right now? It is 15 after six.
[332.60s -> 334.02s]  People were just saying that.
[334.02s -> 335.98s]  Alright, I'm ready.
[335.98s -> 338.33s]  What are we going to say, Italics, before I cut you off?
[338.33s -> 341.86s]  I don't, I don't know.
[341.86s -> 343.30s]  I guess to further introduce myself,
[343.30s -> 344.66s]  I'm a machinima realm director.
[344.66s -> 346.78s]  So I'm on, I'm on the other side of the chasm
[346.78s -> 349.10s]  between the two machinima mountains.
[351.07s -> 352.51s]  I come in peace.
[352.51s -> 353.99s]  Here we go. People are already starting to join.
[353.99s -> 364.82s]  Let's do it. 68.177.101.44 colon 27016.
[364.82s -> 366.68s]  You better go.
[366.68s -> 368.44s]  Oh, that confused me. It had 16.
[368.44s -> 374.00s]  I pressed six first.
[374.00s -> 375.48s]  Well, you better get in there.
[375.48s -> 378.66s]  Those team numbers always confuse me.
[378.66s -> 380.66s]  Hey, I think, so it still says, oh, I'm playing,
[380.66s -> 382.58s]  I didn't even update the dashboard either.
[382.58s -> 384.90s]  And I think it's still correct.
[384.90s -> 386.94s]  Actually, I'll have to change it right now.
[386.94s -> 391.01s]  Oh. Put TF2 MOAB hunting.
[394.65s -> 396.42s]  TF2 MOAB hunting.
[396.42s -> 398.06s]  All you're going to do is get 25 kills in a row.
[398.06s -> 401.51s]  That's very difficult to do in this game.
[401.51s -> 403.27s]  That is not an easy thing to do in Team Fortress,
[403.27s -> 405.39s]  to get more than, more than,
[405.43s -> 407.07s]  I'd say more than 15 kills in a row,
[407.07s -> 410.16s]  10 kills in a row is even like a pretty big feat of strength.
[410.16s -> 414.69s]  The only one who could do it is a, like, an engineer.
[414.69s -> 416.69s]  Yeah, a heavy too. Heavy can get a lot of kills.
[416.69s -> 418.93s]  An engineer if nobody is, like, smart and going
[418.93s -> 424.47s]  demo mannered over medic.
[424.47s -> 428.57s]  I went on to see a red team.
[428.57s -> 431.69s]  How's the game audio? Let's take a look.
[431.69s -> 434.09s]  Yeah, it's all right.
[434.09s -> 435.53s]  How's the end game audio, guys?
[435.53s -> 440.06s]  Good. I cannot tell.
[440.06s -> 442.62s]  Are you going to tell them what your name is?
[442.66s -> 446.22s]  Uh, people will probably figure it out by now.
[446.22s -> 452.41s]  Dick Simmons, the dump champion.
[452.41s -> 454.77s]  Oh, where's the scout going?
[454.77s -> 456.49s]  Oh!
[458.47s -> 460.38s]  That's a pretty nice flare gun, dude.
[460.38s -> 463.47s]  Oh, I thought that was you.
[463.47s -> 464.83s]  Oh, watch it. Watch out.
[464.83s -> 470.76s]  What's up, Stil?
[470.76s -> 473.06s]  I forgot fire kills me.
[473.06s -> 475.30s]  Going up pretty well here.
[475.30s -> 476.66s]  All right, what do I have for a melee right now?
[476.66s -> 479.84s]  I don't even know.
[479.84s -> 481.16s]  Oh, actually, I got the postal pummeler.
[481.16s -> 485.06s]  All right, let's try and get some postal pummeler kills.
[485.06s -> 486.22s]  Yeah, you, no, you're not a spy.
[486.22s -> 489.21s]  I need a medic.
[490.29s -> 491.05s]  Oh, yeah.
[491.05s -> 491.65s]  We did it.
[491.65s -> 494.43s]  Game over.
[494.43s -> 496.74s]  Oh, we did it, guys.
[496.74s -> 497.74s]  So we can do it again.
[497.74s -> 504.18s]  Pretty cool.
[504.18s -> 505.45s]  Oh, we're changing.
[505.45s -> 506.57s]  I wanted to play on Upward, too.
[506.57s -> 507.69s]  Oh, I love Upward.
[507.69s -> 509.98s]  I know, I love it, too.
[509.98s -> 512.89s]  Upward is one of my favorites.
[512.89s -> 517.45s]  Upward.
[517.45s -> 519.27s]  Oh.
[519.27s -> 520.07s]  What are we going to do now?
[520.07s -> 522.43s]  My most kills is only 25 as a sniper.
[522.43s -> 524.40s]  I would have only gotten one MOAB.
[524.40s -> 525.12s]  I have no idea.
[525.12s -> 527.24s]  Oh, Thunder Mountain. Good. I love Thunder Mountain.
[527.24s -> 528.72s]  I like the first two stages.
[528.72s -> 530.08s]  Thunder Mountain.
[530.08s -> 533.00s]  Jerma, can I be has in a hug?
[533.00s -> 535.36s]  If you're asking for a hug, here, ready?
[535.40s -> 536.36s]  Internet hug.
[536.36s -> 536.88s]  There we go.
[536.88s -> 539.94s]  He has him in your hug.
[539.94s -> 540.38s]  Here we go.
[540.38s -> 542.08s]  He has been in.
[542.08s -> 545.39s]  Here comes the internet hug.
[545.39s -> 548.54s]  You just received internet hug.
[548.54s -> 550.43s]  Worth $15.
[550.43s -> 552.60s]  You've got hugs.
[552.60s -> 555.01s]  That's actually pretty good.
[555.01s -> 556.17s]  You've got mail.
[556.17s -> 557.29s]  Oh, I have a new item.
[557.29s -> 558.41s]  Oh, I got a new item.
[558.41s -> 559.49s]  I'm giving away my backpack.
[559.49s -> 564.56s]  I finally got some new stuff.
[564.56s -> 565.76s]  Why am I even running?
[565.76s -> 566.68s]  Waiting for players.
[566.68s -> 568.82s]  Where are we going?
[568.82s -> 570.62s]  You guys, no one's got to give me stuff.
[570.62s -> 573.41s]  I mean, items are one thing.
[573.41s -> 575.13s]  I have a nice plan.
[575.13s -> 577.66s]  As you probably saw in my latest video, if you haven't,
[577.66s -> 580.82s]  I'm going to do a crate unboxing video.
[580.82s -> 583.79s]  And whatever I get in those crates,
[583.79s -> 585.51s]  if I get an unusual or something,
[585.51s -> 587.92s]  it's going to be given away.
[587.92s -> 590.80s]  Any unusual I get in the boxes is going to be given away.
[590.80s -> 592.44s]  And if I get strangers, they're mine.
[592.44s -> 597.44s]  I'm keeping them.
[597.44s -> 601.03s]  Oh, we got a false server.
[601.03s -> 601.79s]  I will probably...
[601.79s -> 603.71s]  Is this 24?
[603.71s -> 606.10s]  Yeah, this is five spectators.
[606.10s -> 610.33s]  I'm sure some people are kind of stuck in spectator right now.
[610.33s -> 614.48s]  But the unboxing video will probably be next week,
[614.52s -> 616.07s]  I would assume.
[616.07s -> 619.18s]  A duel, you say?
[619.18s -> 620.86s]  Dick Simmons, the Dump Champion.
[620.86s -> 621.42s]  Yeah, that's me.
[621.42s -> 623.30s]  Dick Simmons, the Dump Champion.
[623.30s -> 627.03s]  Wait, did you put end quotes on that?
[627.03s -> 629.63s]  I think this is just a parentheses.
[629.63s -> 633.08s]  That's all I know.
[633.08s -> 634.68s]  Is Shibby on this stream?
[634.68s -> 637.20s]  I don't think so.
[637.20s -> 640.19s]  I've been wrong before, though.
[640.19s -> 642.39s]  All right, I closed my door there.
[642.39s -> 644.47s]  Shibby is not on this stream.
[644.47s -> 646.63s]  Not in the chat, anyway.
[646.63s -> 648.34s]  No, not that I can see.
[648.34s -> 649.34s]  High five.
[649.34s -> 653.22s]  Thank you.
[653.22s -> 655.04s]  Can I just kill somebody already?
[655.04s -> 655.56s]  We got to wait.
[655.76s -> 657.04s]  It's setup time, man.
[657.04s -> 660.90s]  I want to blow them underneath the fence.
[660.90s -> 662.38s]  Will I ever play Dawn of War 2?
[662.38s -> 663.22s]  Oh, man.
[663.22s -> 664.66s]  I was a huge Dawn of War 1 fan.
[664.66s -> 666.82s]  I don't really like what they did with Dawn of War 2.
[666.82s -> 667.82s]  I'm not going to lie.
[667.82s -> 669.42s]  I wasn't a big Dawn of War 2 person.
[669.42s -> 673.21s]  Oh, my God.
[673.21s -> 677.49s]  Oh, I forgot, I don't have a shotgun.
[677.49s -> 677.97s]  Still pretty good.
[677.97s -> 680.08s]  Oh, thanks.
[680.08s -> 682.74s]  Covered in the G.F. Rowdy.
[682.74s -> 684.18s]  I'm going to puke because I get...
[684.18s -> 687.04s]  Gerardi makes me puke.
[687.04s -> 689.98s]  Oh, my God, Gerardi, get out of here.
[689.98s -> 691.27s]  Conqueror.
[691.27s -> 693.42s]  Conturer.
[693.42s -> 695.38s]  I can't believe how many no points I got right there.
[695.38s -> 697.88s]  Oh, no, damn it.
[697.92s -> 699.56s]  I thought I had more rockets loaded.
[699.56s -> 700.96s]  S-H-I-T.
[700.96s -> 701.76s]  What does that spell?
[701.76s -> 703.81s]  Shoot.
[703.81s -> 705.62s]  Gosh darn it.
[705.62s -> 706.38s]  Oh, Goose Jr.
[706.38s -> 710.33s]  That's what that spells.
[710.33s -> 712.13s]  Ba-boom, ba-boom.
[712.13s -> 713.09s]  Who am I streaming with?
[713.09s -> 715.65s]  MLC Stealth and Italics.
[715.65s -> 719.18s]  Two bros.
[719.18s -> 721.38s]  We play games.
[721.38s -> 723.10s]  Therefore, we are special.
[723.10s -> 725.22s]  Sometimes we play video games.
[725.22s -> 727.23s]  Occasionally.
[727.23s -> 728.79s]  Sometimes we laugh.
[728.79s -> 730.07s]  Sometimes we cry.
[730.07s -> 732.35s]  Sometimes we share valuable moments together
[732.35s -> 733.23s]  that make us better.
[733.23s -> 736.23s]  Oh, he's going to get away.
[736.23s -> 737.31s]  I refuse to let him get away.
[737.31s -> 740.25s]  He's going to get behind everybody.
[740.29s -> 741.73s]  He's going to get behind us all.
[741.73s -> 742.65s]  I think he already is.
[742.65s -> 744.90s]  Oh, he's gone.
[744.90s -> 749.06s]  Oh, nine health, and I'm jumping off of high surfaces.
[749.06s -> 750.98s]  Oh, how do I survive?
[750.98s -> 754.90s]  Give me that health.
[754.90s -> 757.94s]  Can you donate an unusual?
[757.94s -> 760.76s]  I thought you were about to say, can you dig it, sucker?
[760.76s -> 763.08s]  I would rather you hang on to that.
[763.08s -> 763.84s]  I don't need anything.
[763.84s -> 765.60s]  You don't have to give me stuff.
[765.60s -> 766.16s]  Booker T.
[766.16s -> 768.68s]  Especially an unusual, because an unusual is worth a lot.
[768.68s -> 776.62s]  And I don't want to take stuff like that from people, so.
[776.62s -> 777.82s]  Oh, did I make it?
[777.82s -> 780.17s]  Oh, my God.
[780.17s -> 781.92s]  That was a good shot.
[781.96s -> 790.22s]  That guy caught me right when I was coming down.
[790.22s -> 792.58s]  Boom.
[792.58s -> 796.10s]  I got to take off the Conqueror.
[796.10s -> 801.36s]  Conqueror is a cool, not feeling the Conqueror.
[801.36s -> 802.75s]  Not right now.
[802.75s -> 807.26s]  Oh, damn.
[807.26s -> 816.66s]  That was in the face.
[816.66s -> 817.74s]  I'm taking this off.
[817.74s -> 821.90s]  I'm going to put on, what am I going to put on?
[821.90s -> 823.34s]  I'm going to put on the shotgun.
[823.34s -> 826.39s]  The strange shotgun, I still have to give these away.
[826.39s -> 827.79s]  I have given my third.
[827.79s -> 830.69s]  I've given 33% of the backpack away so far.
[830.69s -> 833.05s]  Two more people I have to get in contact with.
[833.05s -> 841.74s]  And then after that, start all over again.
[841.74s -> 846.26s]  All right, I'm going medic.
[846.26s -> 848.74s]  Yeah, we could use, we only got one.
[848.74s -> 849.94s]  Oh, actually, you are the one.
[849.94s -> 851.02s]  You just switched.
[851.02s -> 852.66s]  Actually, there's two, I think.
[852.66s -> 853.90s]  Ari's medicing.
[853.90s -> 858.86s]  Oh, OK, OK, OK, sexy, sexy.
[858.86s -> 862.70s]  Which one is Jerma?
[862.70s -> 867.36s]  I swear, it's not Dick Simmons, the Dumped Champion.
[867.36s -> 870.10s]  That is a spy.
[870.10s -> 873.17s]  Oh, no.
[873.17s -> 879.59s]  OK, if I see Uba, is it Uba Charge?
[879.59s -> 881.47s]  What classes are you guys playing as right now?
[881.47s -> 882.11s]  I'm soldier.
[882.11s -> 884.12s]  Oh, no.
[884.12s -> 885.89s]  Oh, so little help.
[885.89s -> 890.06s]  I am the sniper jam.
[890.06s -> 891.38s]  What are my video settings on here?
[891.38s -> 892.89s]  I'll show you.
[892.93s -> 896.57s]  Video, 1280 by 720, because I'm running in a window right now.
[896.57s -> 898.38s]  It's going to be able to stream it.
[898.38s -> 902.46s]  But I play on high, high, high, simple, medium, disabled color
[902.46s -> 904.78s]  correction, and then all these other things.
[904.78s -> 908.10s]  I don't play with anti-aliasing on.
[908.10s -> 909.46s]  I feel like the amount of resources
[909.46s -> 911.74s]  it takes to the amount of gain you get
[911.74s -> 915.86s]  is not really that noticeable, at least in my opinion.
[915.86s -> 919.12s]  At least for a game like this.
[919.12s -> 920.48s]  Oh, my word.
[920.48s -> 923.28s]  Thank you for putting me out of fire, Pyro.
[923.28s -> 924.60s]  I always play with Vsync.
[925.00s -> 926.28s]  God damn.
[926.28s -> 927.94s]  Always.
[927.94s -> 936.42s]  I'm changing to engineer.
[936.42s -> 938.79s]  Do I play any commonly hated games?
[938.79s -> 940.99s]  Oh, backstab, turn around, spy.
[940.99s -> 942.95s]  Do you guys play any commonly hated games?
[942.95s -> 945.74s]  He's outside our door.
[945.74s -> 947.66s]  Any commonly hated games?
[947.66s -> 948.42s]  I call a duty.
[948.42s -> 950.70s]  What would fall under that?
[950.70s -> 952.26s]  That's probably number one right there.
[952.26s -> 953.30s]  Yeah, stealth.
[953.30s -> 954.54s]  Answer is yes.
[954.54s -> 958.12s]  Stealth does play commonly hated games.
[958.12s -> 964.46s]  But actually hated, literally bad games, I don't know.
[964.50s -> 971.31s]  Yeah, I don't think I play any really hated games.
[971.31s -> 973.39s]  Oh, there's the sniper again.
[973.39s -> 976.13s]  We still got a level one up.
[976.13s -> 977.57s]  Oh, I think I'm about to score.
[977.57s -> 979.21s]  Oh, come on.
[979.21s -> 980.53s]  Is this guy hacking?
[980.53s -> 985.29s]  I see a spy on their team running around in his taunts,
[985.29s -> 989.13s]  and he looks like a wax figure just moving around,
[989.13s -> 990.83s]  skating around.
[990.83s -> 994.01s]  It's probably a glitch or something, I don't know.
[994.01s -> 995.09s]  Yeah, I saw that earlier too.
[995.09s -> 997.14s]  I think it is just a glitch.
[997.14s -> 998.54s]  But even when he was disguised,
[998.58s -> 1001.98s]  it was just walking around, like not moving.
[1004.81s -> 1006.59s]  Like arms in the air.
[1007.55s -> 1009.31s]  Oh, I gotta change this.
[1009.31s -> 1012.14s]  I don't gotta change that, what am I doing?
[1012.14s -> 1012.98s]  You gotta change it.
[1012.98s -> 1015.33s]  Oh, I gotta hurry the hell up.
[1015.33s -> 1017.58s]  Oh boy.
[1017.58s -> 1020.25s]  I was a second behind.
[1020.25s -> 1022.87s]  I threw my games off, rollin' off now.
[1022.87s -> 1025.34s]  What is this, like an RTS?
[1025.34s -> 1026.72s]  I've gotta catch up.
[1028.41s -> 1031.54s]  My actions permitted is only 100.
[1031.54s -> 1036.50s]  Let's go, let's go.
[1036.50s -> 1037.58s]  Let's do a hoot.
[1037.58s -> 1039.50s]  What's the best scatter gun for the scout?
[1039.50s -> 1040.82s]  They're all good.
[1041.70s -> 1043.69s]  It depends on how you play stylus.
[1043.69s -> 1047.48s]  Mid-range to long-range, you use the shortstop.
[1047.48s -> 1049.60s]  Close range, meat shots, force of nature,
[1049.60s -> 1051.00s]  and everything else kind of in between.
[1051.00s -> 1053.40s]  The regular scatter gun's probably the best,
[1053.40s -> 1055.00s]  at least that's kinda how I see it.
[1055.00s -> 1056.57s]  I like that one the best.
[1056.57s -> 1058.09s]  No, I gotta go over here, what am I doing?
[1058.09s -> 1060.42s]  Oh god, I've already screwed this up.
[1060.42s -> 1063.52s]  Can I salvage this is the real question.
[1063.52s -> 1068.27s]  That's the real question, can I salvage this?
[1068.27s -> 1069.31s]  What am I doing?
[1069.31s -> 1070.51s]  I don't know where I wanna put it.
[1070.51s -> 1071.79s]  I don't know what I wanna do.
[1071.79s -> 1074.09s]  I'm so torn right now.
[1074.09s -> 1075.05s]  Because this guy's right here now,
[1075.05s -> 1077.34s]  I'm puttin' it right here.
[1077.34s -> 1078.58s]  Dilemmas, dilemmas.
[1078.58s -> 1080.62s]  That was so torn, my brain couldn't
[1080.62s -> 1085.50s]  not handle what I was just doing.
[1085.50s -> 1091.34s]  Oh lord, oh this is going down in two seconds.
[1091.34s -> 1092.18s]  I am absolutely.
[1092.18s -> 1093.10s]  Oh lag.
[1093.10s -> 1094.69s]  Oh yeah, I got that too.
[1094.69s -> 1100.74s]  Super lag, is that the real MLC stealth?
[1100.74s -> 1101.58s]  I hope so.
[1101.58s -> 1102.92s]  Yep.
[1102.92s -> 1106.10s]  Oh, I'm gettin' a lot of lag.
[1106.10s -> 1107.98s]  Thank you, Engineer, for helping me build this.
[1107.98s -> 1113.42s]  Appreciate it.
[1113.42s -> 1115.03s]  Let's reload.
[1115.03s -> 1116.47s]  Is that the real MLC stealth?
[1116.47s -> 1121.60s]  Oh yeah.
[1121.60s -> 1123.84s]  All right, I got some catching up to do in points.
[1123.84s -> 1125.52s]  This is kinda getting embarrassing.
[1125.52s -> 1126.36s]  Oh my gosh.
[1126.36s -> 1128.68s]  Here comes, oh there goes the dispenser.
[1128.68s -> 1132.08s]  Oh my god, oh he's up top.
[1132.08s -> 1134.55s]  Oh, that just ruined my life.
[1134.55s -> 1135.71s]  There's the spy again.
[1135.71s -> 1137.47s]  Unmoving.
[1137.47s -> 1138.63s]  Yeah, I got him.
[1138.63s -> 1140.03s]  Or maybe he did run too nice.
[1140.03s -> 1148.17s]  We're goin' this.
[1148.17s -> 1150.38s]  I like this better.
[1150.38s -> 1152.90s]  So I don't feel as bad when I lose all my stuff.
[1152.90s -> 1157.46s]  I was spy, doin' his thing.
[1157.46s -> 1159.92s]  I think that, oh my word.
[1159.92s -> 1162.73s]  He is doin' his thing, isn't he?
[1162.73s -> 1164.41s]  Get away, roommate.
[1164.41s -> 1165.61s]  He's still alive.
[1165.61s -> 1167.69s]  Oh, he is not dead.
[1167.69s -> 1168.53s]  I didn't get the,
[1168.53s -> 1170.57s]  dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[1170.57s -> 1172.25s]  I'm gonna duel with him right now.
[1172.25s -> 1173.09s]  Oh yeah?
[1173.25s -> 1175.77s]  So I didn't get the dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[1175.77s -> 1177.31s]  I don't know where he went.
[1177.31s -> 1178.15s]  Find him!
[1178.15s -> 1182.74s]  He's on the cart.
[1182.74s -> 1185.62s]  Oh my god.
[1185.62s -> 1188.23s]  You're all right, Doc.
[1188.23s -> 1190.48s]  Oh, run away.
[1190.48s -> 1192.31s]  I wanted up here.
[1192.31s -> 1195.90s]  They're about to get to the point.
[1195.90s -> 1196.74s]  They're almost there.
[1196.74s -> 1197.58s]  Oh, crit thing.
[1197.58s -> 1198.58s]  Oh no no no no, where is he?
[1198.58s -> 1200.45s]  He's, oh, oh no!
[1200.45s -> 1201.46s]  Give me the help.
[1201.46s -> 1202.66s]  Oh my god, run away.
[1204.42s -> 1208.78s]  Oh, this guy's so gonna get me.
[1208.78s -> 1210.42s]  Oh no.
[1210.42s -> 1216.74s]  Oh, I can't believe I'm still alive.
[1216.74s -> 1217.58s]  Additional time.
[1217.58s -> 1218.86s]  They got it.
[1218.86s -> 1219.78s]  No, I was dead.
[1219.78s -> 1223.22s]  I was toast right there.
[1223.22s -> 1225.58s]  I was toast!
[1225.58s -> 1229.11s]  uh... what what your toast
[1229.11s -> 1231.63s]  what's name tag i think that it did
[1231.63s -> 1235.19s]  the jeffrey's for anybody else that the chat brosford that somebody is coming
[1235.19s -> 1238.14s]  to you
[1238.14s -> 1243.90s]  uh... i don't think the chepros no i was looking at it and i was like wait no
[1243.90s -> 1244.70s]  uh...
[1244.70s -> 1245.58s]  all they're going to
[1245.58s -> 1247.30s]  they got a heavy medic right here
[1247.30s -> 1249.67s]  get rid of that medic
[1249.67s -> 1251.42s]  but what they could
[1251.42s -> 1254.42s]  uh...
[1254.42s -> 1255.78s]  but all else fails just
[1255.78s -> 1257.06s]  ducking cover
[1257.06s -> 1260.40s]  well i'll just rather than are you like sounds that stuff
[1260.40s -> 1263.04s]  than a prominent things
[1263.04s -> 1265.32s]  uh... you can find out i think
[1265.32s -> 1267.06s]  so there's a lot of
[1267.06s -> 1268.26s]  fishery of sp
[1268.26s -> 1270.18s]  their spies like surfing around in the
[1270.18s -> 1273.44s]  our base there's two spies i think sitting outside our doors
[1273.44s -> 1275.16s]  all dot he's over here
[1275.16s -> 1277.23s]  not wait but that's not in my
[1277.23s -> 1279.17s]  that's not my century
[1279.17s -> 1280.81s]  really lose it here guys
[1280.81s -> 1284.75s]  i break in and i will do it
[1284.75s -> 1288.84s]  get out of my way
[1288.84s -> 1290.48s]  no no no
[1290.48s -> 1294.87s]  uh... just barely saved up
[1294.87s -> 1296.27s]  so many people
[1296.27s -> 1297.25s]  so much death
[1297.25s -> 1298.97s]  tried it's dispenser
[1298.97s -> 1302.19s]  all of the time i know you're not good
[1302.19s -> 1305.91s]  because
[1305.91s -> 1307.25s]  while i don't know
[1307.25s -> 1309.57s]  okay i'm going to make sense
[1309.57s -> 1311.86s]  someone to get toasted out there
[1311.86s -> 1315.50s]  or it's probably going to be is that you get
[1315.50s -> 1319.30s]  was a u s is a walk right next to it was that uh... spying that you richard
[1319.30s -> 1320.34s]  that that's me
[1320.34s -> 1323.19s]  uh...
[1323.19s -> 1327.40s]  radio record
[1327.40s -> 1329.12s]  uh... get the medic
[1329.12s -> 1332.36s]  other i went from like last place like fourth place in one line
[1332.36s -> 1333.76s]  but i thought
[1333.76s -> 1335.24s]  but i don't
[1335.24s -> 1337.23s]  but we don't
[1337.23s -> 1338.79s]  i've had to spot
[1338.79s -> 1339.71s]  uh... well
[1339.71s -> 1341.24s]  uh... high
[1341.24s -> 1343.58s]  what i don't know what i want to be cool
[1343.58s -> 1346.09s]  so i was talking to my man
[1346.09s -> 1354.24s]  i'm gonna get back step that's a spy
[1354.24s -> 1359.95s]  uh... well shoot
[1359.95s -> 1362.46s]  are going to go this is what i'm talking about
[1362.46s -> 1363.34s]  al
[1363.34s -> 1368.49s]  one of the scoreboard boys
[1368.49s -> 1370.37s]  i have faith in your germa
[1370.37s -> 1373.65s]  i wonder if i will play you think uh...
[1373.65s -> 1376.37s]  wonder if you're going to make the hell was that
[1376.37s -> 1378.38s]  what the hell was that
[1378.38s -> 1381.54s]  just get a nice gun emplacement at the end of that hallway right there
[1381.54s -> 1383.99s]  and that's right i can turn it
[1383.99s -> 1386.03s]  that you destroyed it
[1386.03s -> 1389.93s]  because of the little
[1389.93s -> 1393.05s]  uh... i probably will play zombie fortress at some point
[1393.05s -> 1394.99s]  probably not a little what
[1394.99s -> 1396.73s]  zombie fortress
[1396.73s -> 1399.01s]  i'm just going to punches on it here
[1399.01s -> 1401.15s]  room i'm not going out with one punch
[1401.15s -> 1403.67s]  you'll get knocked out
[1403.67s -> 1408.01s]  all come on feel the pain
[1408.01s -> 1409.01s]  i would kill them too
[1409.01s -> 1409.69s]  one-off
[1409.69s -> 1413.81s]  boxes from a quick one shot
[1413.81s -> 1419.75s]  uh... set the next level through a lot of changes are at this anyway so
[1419.75s -> 1422.02s]  one
[1422.02s -> 1423.84s]  well that answers that question
[1423.84s -> 1425.34s]  we're changing server
[1425.34s -> 1428.53s]  just uh... people want to know germa what is on the fortress
[1428.53s -> 1431.39s]  i uh... i don't know i think it's like i like
[1431.39s -> 1433.89s]  ever all my
[1433.89s -> 1435.61s]  everybody plays
[1435.61s -> 1438.65s]  i would think it was mainly except for small group people
[1438.65s -> 1440.01s]  somebody's planet
[1440.01s -> 1442.33s]  also it's like infection on halo
[1442.33s -> 1443.97s]  i hate you're not me
[1443.97s -> 1445.35s]  whatever that game was called
[1445.35s -> 1446.53s]  i think i know what you're talking about
[1446.53s -> 1447.61s]  yes it's it's like
[1447.61s -> 1450.99s]  it's kinda like a zombie boat where everyone runs around the lake separate
[1451.03s -> 1452.67s]  small group of people that don't have
[1452.67s -> 1455.62s]  to go like the not zombies
[1455.62s -> 1458.02s]  wrong somebody please correct me in this in the chat
[1458.02s -> 1461.61s]  i know it's something like that
[1461.61s -> 1465.82s]  that's probably right and they said it's like halo infection much of spies
[1465.82s -> 1468.26s]  how they are taking out everything i got to be a little bit sneakier these
[1468.26s -> 1469.71s]  centuries
[1469.71s -> 1471.07s]  and that's going to blow up and kill me
[1471.07s -> 1473.23s]  and that's going to die as far as
[1473.23s -> 1473.95s]  right
[1473.95s -> 1476.11s]  go i'm going to go
[1476.11s -> 1478.95s]  i'm going to s sounds are you playing as heavy
[1478.95s -> 1481.20s]  i am playing it's heavy
[1481.20s -> 1485.26s]  seascapes what i've reached with ads by cycling around
[1485.26s -> 1488.22s]  i start a scalp and then i'm like okay i suck

[1523.29s -> 1525.38s]  uh... my god
[1525.38s -> 1527.78s]  on the other side
[1527.78s -> 1529.06s]  our battle is
[1529.06s -> 1531.06s]  about what about the words
[1531.06s -> 1533.20s]  yeah there's two spots on the point
[1533.20s -> 1535.35s]  on the card we lost
[1535.35s -> 1538.02s]  but what do you guys know that i was
[1538.02s -> 1545.46s]  how many spots are on that day of team
[1545.46s -> 1547.14s]  uh... new uh... new server
[1547.14s -> 1548.58s]  not gg

[1552.98s -> 1555.74s]  party
[1555.74s -> 1562.00s]  go to
[1562.00s -> 1563.92s]  uh... national you know i'm gonna
[1563.92s -> 1566.24s]  screens go black for one second
[1566.24s -> 1569.09s]  because i'm gonna change uh...
[1569.09s -> 1572.96s]  and change some real quick
[1572.96s -> 1573.72s]  why do that
[1573.72s -> 1577.60s]  i'll be ready for about ten seconds and you'll see what my parents
[1577.60s -> 1579.32s]  well because for some reason when i was
[1579.32s -> 1583.83s]  doing excellent in the game mode it was like in my game a lot of life
[1583.83s -> 1586.21s]  sometimes i guess it does that
[1586.21s -> 1591.28s]  yeah are you using uh... it's like uh...
[1591.28s -> 1592.32s]  screen area
[1592.32s -> 1595.08s]  or the other one i was in the game source from the game that was like
[1595.08s -> 1596.42s]  lagging my games or
[1596.42s -> 1597.94s]  uh... try screen area
[1597.94s -> 1602.15s]  i'd add is that it's a nice change over
[1602.15s -> 1605.72s]  explicitly supposed to be like the release
[1605.72s -> 1608.06s]  uh... let's go to
[1608.10s -> 1609.70s]  because of the simple
[1609.70s -> 1614.59s]  because of all of our high tower i've heard zero out of
[1614.59s -> 1617.34s]  hopefully stuff gets back soon
[1617.34s -> 1620.39s]  allies is going to be a good trouble
[1620.39s -> 1621.59s]  to delay for him
[1621.59s -> 1623.55s]  when we were doing the test
[1623.55s -> 1626.71s]  i was using game source and it was working fine so it just seems like
[1626.71s -> 1630.59s]  on again off again

[2296.49s -> 2299.52s]  team
[2299.52s -> 2303.48s]  to account it's it's got to be at least three

[2350.29s -> 2354.17s]  enough of this nonsense where i getting shot from i don't think that you know

[2464.90s -> 2467.86s]  all right after this we're going to another server
[2467.86s -> 2469.88s]  because
[2469.88s -> 2472.27s]  we need to scramble these teams
[2472.27s -> 2474.68s]  uh...
[2474.68s -> 2478.61s]  they've got a century gun right next to our cart
[2478.61s -> 2482.24s]  that's not cool

[2630.08s -> 2632.38s]  that possible
[2632.38s -> 2634.00s]  uh...
[2634.00s -> 2635.32s]  that's
[2635.32s -> 2638.55s]  sorry those of you that is that how does that make any sense
[2638.55s -> 2642.78s]  we were on our we were on our way in for a really good the game

[2665.12s -> 2667.84s]  if they're they're probably listening
[2667.84s -> 2670.16s]  yet but it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's like a ten
[2670.16s -> 2672.12s]  second delay though
[2672.12s -> 2673.60s]  yet still
[2673.60s -> 2677.67s]  there's there's somebody out there with this ridiculous internet speeds
[2677.67s -> 2679.64s]  yeah they can just
[2679.64s -> 2682.90s]  come pipeline
[2682.90s -> 2686.42s]  payload yesterday angel of that this is italics plane

[2687.76s -> 2688.62s]  hey guys
[2688.62s -> 2690.33s]  a strange love
[2690.33s -> 2693.60s]  how's it going so this is the server

[2694.88s -> 2696.78s]  what way hold on a second
[2696.78s -> 2698.45s]  that already fill up

[2704.04s -> 2705.18s]  appreciate
[2705.18s -> 2710.94s]  i thought you didn't join that's what i thought at first
[2710.94s -> 2716.24s]  this is like a jellyfish server
[2716.24s -> 2720.94s]  like the screen is more like a jellyfish for me right now
[2720.94s -> 2722.70s]  we don't like everybody is
[2722.70s -> 2725.60s]  look at this i feel like it's like
[2725.60s -> 2729.11s]  oh my god is claymation server
[2729.11s -> 2731.79s]  what's his name let me see what
[2731.79s -> 2733.51s]  well uh...
[2733.51s -> 2736.96s]  all look at that hangs mind goodness gracious
[2736.96s -> 2738.96s]  everyone except for me and you is like
[2738.96s -> 2740.20s]  a hundred plus
[2740.20s -> 2743.18s]  it really looks like a click stop motion animation
[2743.18s -> 2745.08s]  like that
[2745.08s -> 2748.44s]  all you know i'd like to put
[2748.44s -> 2752.52s]  so it feels like i'm playing at twenty frames per second but i'm not
[2752.52s -> 2753.79s]  but i'm not
[2753.79s -> 2756.04s]  uh... sorry guys
[2756.04s -> 2759.48s]  look at we got a change again because this is this bad
[2759.48s -> 2762.84s]  this is not this is not against the people who are here this is one of the
[2762.84s -> 2765.00s]  people who didn't get it
[2765.00s -> 2768.06s]  you know it's right if you don't even look at the street and see what what i
[2768.06s -> 2771.44s]  see right now it is like
[2771.44s -> 2774.42s]  pretty much like a watch in a cartoon on drugs
[2774.42s -> 2778.84s]  uh...
[2778.84s -> 2782.03s]  all right well how do you have looks like nobody could even get into this one
[2782.03s -> 2782.91s]  there's only
[2782.91s -> 2785.45s]  seven on eight
[2785.45s -> 2786.93s]  i apologize
[2786.93s -> 2788.23s]  i sorry
[2788.23s -> 2791.21s]  news service
[2791.21s -> 2792.77s]  take three
[2792.77s -> 2794.21s]  uh... third time's a charm
[2794.21s -> 2795.65s]  but i want
[2795.65s -> 2797.80s]  uh... to
[2797.80s -> 2799.22s]  uh... three crunch
[2799.22s -> 2800.66s]  so it's like it might might
[2800.86s -> 2802.78s]  it's not really a thirty two person server
[2802.78s -> 2804.15s]  hope i can
[2804.15s -> 2807.86s]  but it would tell i get that server will be okay
[2807.86s -> 2810.60s]  i want to serve all the cool kids have one
[2810.60s -> 2812.81s]  all right here we go
[2812.81s -> 2815.53s]  sixty-six dot fifty-five
[2815.53s -> 2817.66s]  dot one five four
[2817.66s -> 2819.20s]  don't two three four
[2819.20s -> 2821.42s]  colon two seven zero one
[2821.42s -> 2822.50s]  by
[2822.50s -> 2826.02s]  and we paste this in a second once we get in
[2826.02s -> 2829.74s]  i do apologize that we have to do this twice now is the third time
[2829.74s -> 2831.76s]  hopefully this one is going to be the
[2832.16s -> 2835.60s]  they pasted it in already
[2835.60s -> 2838.96s]  told you it it was like literally two seconds after you said i thought pop up
[2838.96s -> 2840.29s]  in the chat
[2840.29s -> 2842.45s]  as fast
[2842.45s -> 2843.41s]  well
[2843.41s -> 2845.81s]  lightning fast even you might say
[2845.81s -> 2849.46s]  you can say that
[2849.46s -> 2854.44s]  uh...
[2854.44s -> 2858.28s]  well
[2858.28s -> 2859.20s]  i'm going
[2859.20s -> 2860.89s]  demo night
[2860.89s -> 2862.93s]  give them actually found
[2862.93s -> 2863.95s]  uh... sorry what
[2863.95s -> 2865.59s]  as a demo mom i was just
[2865.59s -> 2867.48s]  uh... relaying what you just said
[2867.48s -> 2872.18s]  i actually found a sultan ceremonial the other day
[2872.18s -> 2874.99s]  i was very happy about that
[2874.99s -> 2878.03s]  so now i can have a legit demo night if i wanted to give up my grenade launcher
[2878.03s -> 2880.17s]  but
[2880.17s -> 2881.25s]  so tough call
[2881.25s -> 2885.31s]  for the for the booties
[2885.31s -> 2888.06s]  and we got steady
[2888.06s -> 2896.65s]  wicked sick at
[2896.65s -> 2898.84s]  so i have to do this right now
[2898.84s -> 2901.97s]  because somebody keeps sending me
[2901.97s -> 2903.69s]  very inappropriate
[2903.69s -> 2906.17s]  message and hopefully that stops that from happening
[2906.17s -> 2912.52s]  i don't think it will but i at least right
[2912.52s -> 2916.30s]  oh
[2916.30s -> 2917.62s]  we've got a full server now
[2917.62s -> 2919.78s]  good to go back out
[2919.78s -> 2923.58s]  just in time it's off the railway
[2923.58s -> 2924.46s]  everyone
[2924.46s -> 2926.66s]  also over at the same time
[2926.66s -> 2927.94s]  all my god you just
[2927.94s -> 2931.48s]  totally pretty aggressive
[2931.48s -> 2933.56s]  shot guns soldier
[2933.56s -> 2938.90s]  shot guns soldier
[2938.90s -> 2940.62s]  alike
[2940.62s -> 2941.58s]  did you see that
[2941.58s -> 2942.80s]  yeah
[2942.80s -> 2946.20s]  but i'd love to tonight
[2946.20s -> 2949.62s]  yeah i've only so far given one third of still waiting on two people so
[2949.62s -> 2951.60s]  eventually i will be giving
[2951.60s -> 2956.66s]  a hundred percent but i have to wait for the other two people to get back to me
[2956.66s -> 2960.59s]  that hurt
[2960.59s -> 2963.44s]  old yet i did quite a bit
[2963.44s -> 2966.40s]  someone on the other team is announcing how many spice they have therefore
[2966.40s -> 2968.86s]  apparently
[2968.86s -> 2971.48s]  what a good trader he is
[2971.48s -> 2973.56s]  uh... how ironic is that
[2973.56s -> 2977.72s]  so he's a double spot yes if he is it he's telling us about spying so he's
[2977.72s -> 2978.84s]  spying
[2978.84s -> 2980.36s]  on the spot
[2980.36s -> 2982.30s]  for his own spots
[2982.30s -> 2984.50s]  as someone in the comments will undoubtedly say
[2984.50s -> 2986.60s]  spy section
[2986.60s -> 2990.79s]  absolutely
[2990.79s -> 2993.27s]  problem is maybe he might be
[2993.27s -> 2996.69s]  more suspicious

[2998.79s -> 3001.16s]  he said i served no one
[3001.16s -> 3002.44s]  he did
[3002.44s -> 3004.16s]  don't trust anyone

[3138.40s -> 3140.52s]  i tried to high-five
[3140.52s -> 3143.64s]  so this is going to be the last round of tf-two and i'm going to move on to see
[3143.64s -> 3145.88s]  us go for a little bit

[3812.91s -> 3816.56s]  huge updates let's find out exactly what they did
[3816.56s -> 3821.04s]  in this update
[3821.04s -> 3824.96s]  uh... uh... uh... i've watched south park
[3824.96s -> 3826.50s]  i used to love south park
[3826.50s -> 3827.84s]  back in the day
[3827.84s -> 3838.06s]  it's one of my favorite shows
[3838.06s -> 3843.45s]  that's right they did add a server bro i gotta check that out
[3843.45s -> 3845.13s]  if i can even get in here
[3845.13s -> 3851.09s]  still searching huh
[3851.09s -> 3853.17s]  let's try this again
[3853.17s -> 3860.54s]  find a game
[3860.54s -> 3864.75s]  there we go
[3864.75s -> 3870.07s]  retrieving data
[3870.07s -> 3872.06s]  yeah i'm probably only going to play
[3872.06s -> 3873.74s]  maybe two or three rounds maybe
[3873.74s -> 3879.10s]  ten twenty minutes or so i just want to check out the new update to be honest
[3879.10s -> 3882.67s]  okay so this is the new map no maybe not this is not one of the new maps is it
[3882.67s -> 3886.24s]  i think i've already seen i've already seen no maybe not
[3886.28s -> 3887.72s]  maybe it is a different map
[3887.72s -> 3895.88s]  we'll find out won't we
[3895.88s -> 3899.76s]  trying to pick up a headshot damn
[3899.76s -> 3903.38s]  so this is one of the new maps safe house
[3903.38s -> 3912.46s]  there already is another one like this isn't there
[3912.46s -> 3917.85s]  this game is not free to play it is in beta right now
[3917.85s -> 3922.64s]  it's in closed beta
[3922.64s -> 3924.63s]  alright i gotta stay alive next time
[3924.63s -> 3927.66s]  no more screwing around
[3927.66s -> 3930.37s]  and the terrorists won
[3930.37s -> 3934.94s]  will they be punching pie
[3934.94s -> 3937.14s]  i can't we can't buy
[3937.14s -> 3938.94s]  why can we not buy items
[3938.94s -> 3943.40s]  i thought that's what it said you could do
[3943.40s -> 3946.93s]  i'm gonna go around this way
[3946.97s -> 3947.89s]  see if i can't
[3947.89s -> 3954.90s]  pull something off here and i don't want to climb up there that's a bad idea
[3954.90s -> 3957.15s]  now i just saw somebody
[3957.15s -> 3959.66s]  there we go
[3959.66s -> 3966.98s]  all i'm dead
[3966.98s -> 3969.01s]  all dot
[3969.01s -> 3972.57s]  find these behind me
[3972.57s -> 3978.52s]  it's done bombs down here
[3978.52s -> 3983.74s]  it's only one of them left
[3983.74s -> 3989.05s]  you know that's a teammate
[3989.05s -> 3991.61s]  henderson cooperated for most of the nation's
[3991.61s -> 3999.23s]  uh... we got my name is henderson incorporated
[3999.23s -> 4002.21s]  the clickety clack
[4002.21s -> 4003.62s]  at this game will do that
[4003.62s -> 4007.80s]  you'll get a big clickety clack
[4007.80s -> 4013.11s]  but somebody popped ahead of the i have any grades
[4013.15s -> 4019.27s]  nobody nobody oh my god i'm getting stuck
[4019.27s -> 4020.88s]  he's right here
[4020.88s -> 4023.34s]  well well well well
[4023.34s -> 4029.02s]  that's hanging out of a window
[4029.02s -> 4030.34s]  that was legit like
[4030.34s -> 4034.53s]  floating out of the window
[4034.53s -> 4038.06s]  what do you think i don't like this car
[4038.06s -> 4041.02s]  auto is upstairs right now he is uh...
[4041.02s -> 4045.22s]  i think he's created in the kitchen the honest
[4045.22s -> 4053.70s]  can see some he's a wild dog
[4053.70s -> 4057.33s]  somebody tells everybody
[4057.33s -> 4059.90s]  who's also
[4059.90s -> 4061.28s]  auto is my uh...
[4061.28s -> 4063.28s]  my little dachshund chihuahua
[4063.28s -> 4065.85s]  doberman pincher breed thing
[4065.85s -> 4068.58s]  he's a real cute
[4068.58s -> 4071.98s]  he's a real cute
[4071.98s -> 4074.30s]  i don't play league of legends
[4074.30s -> 4077.50s]  too much for my brain to handle
[4077.50s -> 4081.06s]  i feel the same way about week as i do about starcraft
[4081.06s -> 4081.98s]  and that is
[4081.98s -> 4083.10s]  is already
[4083.10s -> 4087.59s]  teammates are now i guess in a forever
[4087.59s -> 4092.24s]  i feel the same way about legal status starcraft is starcraft is
[4092.24s -> 4095.74s]  is everyone's is really really good
[4095.74s -> 4100.39s]  to be able to play that game you have to also be really really good
[4100.39s -> 4107.98s]  that by probably won't be playing that game anytime soon
[4107.98s -> 4110.70s]  well this is dot or just sit here
[4110.70s -> 4114.23s]  i'm going to play gone game after next round
[4114.23s -> 4116.92s]  is gone games more action
[4116.92s -> 4120.98s]  and i can actually pretty good at going to
[4120.98s -> 4123.22s]  see that this is this game or not that good at
[4123.22s -> 4124.88s]  that the general
[4124.88s -> 4130.18s]  c s go i'm not that good at you know we're going to play a game right now
[4130.18s -> 4133.65s]  to me
[4133.65s -> 4134.65s]  finding
[4134.65s -> 4136.50s]  arms race
[4136.50s -> 4143.32s]  don't matter which one that's the plate
[4143.32s -> 4147.42s]  it's not gone game
[4147.42s -> 4153.06s]  sure is
[4153.06s -> 4153.90s]  gone gay
[4153.90s -> 4158.12s]  gone gay
[4158.12s -> 4160.32s]  don't mean arms or arms races the
[4160.32s -> 4165.82s]  technical term for it
[4167.06s -> 4168.22s]  i love this map
[4168.22s -> 4173.61s]  it's so interesting
[4173.61s -> 4176.30s]  you're like a row i love the girls man
[4176.30s -> 4177.38s]  favorite bands
[4177.38s -> 4181.55s]  by far
[4181.55s -> 4184.50s]  from behind off
[4184.50s -> 4188.50s]  it's right here
[4188.50s -> 4196.87s]  finally moving on moving on the world
[4196.87s -> 4199.82s]  all this to any of them
[4199.82s -> 4201.30s]  boom boom
[4201.30s -> 4213.00s]  boom boom
[4213.00s -> 4215.40s]  that keep in mind i'm playing this in a window
[4215.40s -> 4217.86s]  like half the size of my computer screen
[4217.86s -> 4223.18s]  so it can be kind of difficult to play this game
[4223.18s -> 4230.20s]  how many bolts does it take
[4230.20s -> 4232.82s]  no i don't want to do that
[4232.86s -> 4239.81s]  al
[4239.81s -> 4244.26s]  right
[4244.26s -> 4249.78s]  uh...
[4249.78s -> 4252.34s]  yeah i i wish my computer was good enough to
[4252.34s -> 4255.01s]  play games in full screen and stream them
[4255.01s -> 4258.38s]  but it is uh... it is almost impossible to do that
[4258.38s -> 4261.37s]  and i'm i'm getting destroyed
[4261.37s -> 4262.78s]  my god
[4262.78s -> 4281.33s]  the whole team is like eighteen fourteen and this way i'm going this way
[4281.33s -> 4296.63s]  town
[4296.63s -> 4299.98s]  you know that has shot god damn
[4299.98s -> 4302.36s]  yes not the it's not my internet it's uh...
[4302.36s -> 4303.44s]  my computer just
[4303.44s -> 4304.80s]  probably would not be able to handle it
[4304.80s -> 4306.55s]  and i guess internet to
[4306.55s -> 4308.67s]  to stream at like ten eighty
[4308.67s -> 4322.93s]  or seven twenty it takes a lot of them so
[4322.93s -> 4325.10s]  now i was i don't
[4325.10s -> 4328.82s]  that this this potentially is the worst i'd like the worst game i've ever had in
[4328.82s -> 4331.11s]  this entire game ever
[4331.11s -> 4331.99s]  like ever
[4331.99s -> 4334.16s]  uh...
[4334.16s -> 4335.52s]  is making me look
[4335.52s -> 4337.96s]  embarrassed now i don't care
[4337.96s -> 4341.99s]  i'm just playing for fun as much a company stuff
[4341.99s -> 4344.77s]  my favorite guerrillas song is
[4344.77s -> 4346.24s]  probably style
[4346.24s -> 4348.72s]  i love style
[4348.72s -> 4358.44s]  i don't know that i even was
[4358.44s -> 4360.06s]  al
[4360.06s -> 4365.28s]  al
[4368.52s -> 4372.52s]  let's get a string of people together
[4372.52s -> 4377.42s]  let's get a string of people together
[4377.42s -> 4380.64s]  now it's already got it
[4380.64s -> 4382.00s]  uh...
[4382.00s -> 4383.97s]  uh... seven fifteen
[4383.97s -> 4388.55s]  flip that score out and you got a great score
[4388.55s -> 4390.73s]  at this time to be different
[4390.73s -> 4400.89s]  this time will be different
[4400.89s -> 4404.10s]  you need to pray to the bruins
[4404.10s -> 4407.92s]  all-powerful bruins gods

[4408.96s -> 4414.12s]  shine upon me your strength
[4414.12s -> 4415.56s]  my sensitivity might be wrong
[4415.56s -> 4416.32s]  no it's not
[4416.32s -> 4419.51s]  that's an excuse
[4419.51s -> 4424.20s]  that's just an excuse
