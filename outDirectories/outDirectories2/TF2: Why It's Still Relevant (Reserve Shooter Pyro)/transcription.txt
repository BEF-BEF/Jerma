[0.31s -> 18.87s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm gonna be playing as the Pyro.
[18.87s -> 22.87s]  And before I get started, I do have to apologize. I am getting a little bit of a cold.
[22.87s -> 26.87s]  Because I went to Burger Boy's house, and Burger Boy of course has a cold.
[26.87s -> 30.87s]  And I'm gonna get it, so I'm getting a stuffy nose now. I'm getting a little bit of a head cold.
[30.87s -> 35.05s]  But you know, I had this topic in my head, and I wanted to go over it a little bit.
[35.05s -> 39.05s]  But I wanted to talk about it with you guys, because I find it to be very, very important.
[39.05s -> 44.42s]  And it has to do with why has Team Fortress lasted this long?
[44.42s -> 51.59s]  And when I say this long, I'm really talking about why has the community stayed for this long?
[51.59s -> 57.83s]  Why have we been playing this game for over five years? At least for me, I've been playing this game for over five years.
[57.83s -> 62.83s]  I started back in Team Fortress Classic, as a lot of you guys know, and I've been playing this game ever since.
[62.83s -> 67.83s]  I've never got that urge to stop playing. Sure, I've taken a couple breaks here and there.
[67.83s -> 71.83s]  I've taken one or two breaks, maybe one or two months. I don't feel like playing it, whatever.
[71.83s -> 74.83s]  I'll wait for some updates. But I always come back.
[74.83s -> 80.07s]  There's never been a time when I haven't played this game between two or three months.
[80.07s -> 86.07s]  And it was actually during this gameplay, right here, that I had this epiphany, I guess you could call it.
[86.07s -> 92.11s]  My brain was kind of just telling me, Jeremy, why are you still playing this game?
[92.11s -> 97.11s]  It's been five years, and you're still having this much fun playing this game?
[97.11s -> 103.29s]  Because I love this game. This is one of my favorite games, probably my number one favorite game of all time.
[103.29s -> 107.29s]  And it's really slugged its way up there. It never was like that.
[107.29s -> 114.59s]  This game was probably two or three on the list. But it's made its way up to number one, and I'm trying to think why.
[114.59s -> 119.77s]  And the answer is very, very simple. And I thought about this for a while, but it's very, very simple.
[119.77s -> 123.14s]  What to do with developer attention.
[123.14s -> 127.14s]  Now, I'm going to bring up a couple of different companies here and a couple of different game franchises.
[127.14s -> 133.14s]  This is not meant to hate on anyone. I love these games as well. I play these games all the time.
[133.14s -> 139.14s]  So don't worry, this is not me saying, well, this game sucks. No, no, no, that's not what I'm saying.
[139.14s -> 143.98s]  But anyways, take a look at Call of Duty or Battlefield 3.
[143.98s -> 146.98s]  There are recent iterations. I'm not talking about the franchises in general.
[147.98s -> 153.29s]  So they get content updates, they get patches, bug fixes, all that kind of stuff all the time.
[153.29s -> 158.29s]  The main problem with those updates are, there's a couple of things that I think are wrong with the industry right now,
[158.29s -> 164.29s]  but mostly those content updates are usually not free, at least for Call of Duty.
[164.29s -> 168.59s]  And they're not really that much of a change. They're adding maybe some maps.
[168.59s -> 171.59s]  They're buffing or nerfing a gun or something like that.
[171.59s -> 176.59s]  The changes that they make are not that drastic and they're not that forward-moving.
[176.59s -> 186.26s]  You go to Team Fortress, though, almost all of Team Fortress's big updates are massive, massive game-changing updates.
[186.26s -> 189.26s]  And that's why people keep coming back. That's why I keep playing.
[189.26s -> 196.26s]  That's why I keep my butt sitting in the chair, because I know they're going to add something crazy for the soldier.
[196.26s -> 199.26s]  They're going to add something insane. Look at the Pyro, the Phlogistinator.
[199.26s -> 201.26s]  The Phlogistinator, nobody really saw that coming.
[201.26s -> 205.26s]  And they keep trying to change the game and they keep listening to the community.
[205.26s -> 210.50s]  And the reason why this all came up when I was playing Pyro is very, very important.
[210.50s -> 217.30s]  The Pyro back in 2007 is wildly different than the Pyro now.
[217.30s -> 220.30s]  They didn't even have a compression blast.
[220.30s -> 223.30s]  The compression blast was added into the game in an update.
[223.30s -> 227.48s]  So you got to remember, the Pyro, before the compression blast, you were an ambusher.
[227.48s -> 233.48s]  You kind of hid behind corners, you WM1'd into people, and you only had a default shotgun.
[233.48s -> 237.48s]  And you couldn't blow anybody away, pull the shotgun out like we do now, and shoot people.
[237.48s -> 242.48s]  That's not how it used to work. You just used to run down a hallway holding down the mouse button.
[242.48s -> 245.66s]  Now look at what you can do as the Pyro now.
[245.66s -> 249.66s]  There are so many fun, incredible options to play with.
[249.66s -> 253.66s]  There's the flare gun. There's the reserve shooter, which I'm using right now.
[253.66s -> 258.66s]  There's the detonator, or you could just use the default shotgun, and they keep adding more stuff.
[258.66s -> 261.66s]  And there's the man melter. There's all kinds of stuff.
[261.66s -> 264.83s]  And I think that's why the game has lasted so long.
[264.83s -> 269.83s]  That is why this game is still one of the best. That's still why everybody keeps playing it.
[269.83s -> 276.07s]  They just have so much attention to their franchises, and they really care about what's going into their games.
[276.07s -> 281.07s]  And that's not to say that Dyson, you know, Infinity Ward and Treyarch, they don't put a lot of time into their games.
[281.07s -> 283.07s]  That's not what I'm saying. Of course they do.
[283.07s -> 287.07s]  All these game developers, they put blood, sweat, and tears into all their products.
[287.07s -> 292.07s]  But it's just the way that Valve goes about doing business that I seem to really, really love.
[292.07s -> 299.70s]  And what you're watching right now, by the way, is you watched a spy clip, a little bonus clip, of just a sequence of ridiculous events.
[299.70s -> 301.70s]  I couldn't even believe that all happened.
[301.70s -> 305.19s]  But I wanted to add that because, of course, the Pyro game was a little short.
[305.19s -> 309.19s]  So thank you all so much for watching. This is going to wrap up the video.
[309.19s -> 312.19s]  And keep the discussion going in the comments section, guys.
[313.19s -> 315.19s]  Let me know what you got to say about all this.
[315.19s -> 317.19s]  I would love to jump in and chime in on some of the comments as well.
[317.19s -> 319.19s]  So let me know what you think.
[319.19s -> 324.19s]  And, of course, Happy Mother's Day to all you mothers, or all of your mothers.
[324.19s -> 326.19s]  I think I phrased that right.
[326.19s -> 329.19s]  But yeah, Happy Mother's Day, everybody. I'm a day late, but it's okay.
[329.19s -> 331.69s]  At least it's the thought that counts.
[331.69s -> 333.69s]  So yeah, take it easy, guys. Black screen, I got to get out of here.
[333.69s -> 335.69s]  So I'll see you guys all next time.
[335.69s -> 339.17s]  And take care, everybody.
