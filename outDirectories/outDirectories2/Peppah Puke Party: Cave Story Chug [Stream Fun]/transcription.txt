[195.26s -> 201.69s]  So here's how it's gonna happen. I'm gonna just do it at a very random time. You're not gonna know
[201.69s -> 213.50s]  until it happens. So there you go. Oh, wow. That was great. I wasn't even reading that. Where do I
[213.50s -> 221.34s]  go? I have no idea. I didn't even read one word of that text. Can somebody tell me where I'm going?
[222.65s -> 226.89s]  Maybe I'll just talk to him again. Take suit and escape from this island, please. Okay. Well,
[226.89s -> 236.15s]  where the hell is she? I thought she like went to bed. So how do I equip it? Press the jump

[277.24s -> 288.33s]  Right. All right. We're going to the, we're going to the egg corridor. You thought I was gonna chug
[288.33s -> 292.87s]  it, didn't you? No, you're never going to know when that happens. It's just going to happen.
[293.67s -> 301.37s]  Hey, dude. I don't know what's going on. Why are you asking me? You're supposed to,
[301.37s -> 320.17s]  you're the one that like lives here. Oh, that's delicious. Oh, look out, the frogs. Come on,

[397.53s -> 404.10s]  Story Plus is not free. You can get it on Steam. I believe for $10. I could be wrong.
[407.35s -> 429.50s]  So should I, do I have to go in this door? Oh, that was such a bad idea.
[430.30s -> 440.25s]  Whose idea was that? Whose idea was that? Because we're no longer friends. It was my idea.
[441.50s -> 446.50s]  Jerma, you're not my friend anymore. Oh, do I have to have like a boss fight right now? I'm gonna
[447.38s -> 454.76s]  die. Why did I just kill that guy? It will harm your health.
