[1.53s -> 6.41s]  Oh yeah, friendly fire. You want to do like some like medic pyro jumps?
[6.41s -> 8.41s]  Let's go over here. Come over here, let's jump like into this thing.
[8.41s -> 10.41s]  This would be amazing if it was an actual mechanic.
[10.41s -> 12.41s]  Like friendly fire regardless.
[12.41s -> 16.41s]  Buff the third degree so you can hit your own medic and like jump with him.
[16.41s -> 18.41s]  This is awesome.
[18.41s -> 20.41s]  Alright, let's try to get up there. Ready, so...
[20.41s -> 22.41s]  Ready, go.
[22.41s -> 26.18s]  Just up, straight up here. Yeah!
[26.18s -> 29.00s]  Yes!
[29.00s -> 39.74s]  Okay, so the rule here is,
[39.74s -> 41.74s]  everyone get as close to the middle as you can.
[41.74s -> 43.74s]  Like everyone's stuff on that point.
[43.74s -> 47.43s]  Okay, now at the count of three,
[47.43s -> 51.43s]  literally everybody in here called you like your mother a bitch.
[51.43s -> 53.43s]  Alright, go! One, two, three, go!
[55.43s -> 59.14s]  Why have a Natasha?
[59.14s -> 61.14s]  Why? Who has flames?
[61.14s -> 63.45s]  Who has fire?
[63.45s -> 65.45s]  Who had the fire?
[65.45s -> 67.45s]  Oh, it's the healer.
[67.45s -> 69.45s]  Oh, god.
[72.58s -> 74.58s]  Are you kidding me?
[74.58s -> 76.58s]  That guy's the last one standing.
[76.58s -> 79.53s]  I had the worst one.
[79.53s -> 81.53s]  I didn't know what your plan was. I went in with the Natasha.
[81.53s -> 83.53s]  Yeah, yeah, you did. That sucked.
[83.53s -> 85.53s]  Alright, again. Do it again. Do it again.
[85.53s -> 87.53s]  Do it again. Do it again.
[87.53s -> 89.53s]  Don't kill each other. Hold on, wait a second.
[91.53s -> 94.66s]  The guy that just
[94.66s -> 96.66s]  flew up right here.
[96.66s -> 98.66s]  You got destroyed.
[98.66s -> 100.66s]  Alright, don't kill each other.
[100.66s -> 102.66s]  Do not kill each other.
[102.66s -> 104.66s]  Oh, I know what I'm coming with.
[104.66s -> 107.67s]  Make sure we get everybody inside here.
[107.67s -> 109.67s]  Everyone stuff inside the middle.
[109.67s -> 111.67s]  By the way, whoever is in the very middle, you're dead.
[111.67s -> 113.67s]  Like, you're gonna die instantly.
[116.68s -> 119.56s]  Drebin, you are going to die instantly.
[119.56s -> 121.56s]  It's gonna be ridiculous.
[121.56s -> 123.56s]  Alright, so everyone clump around him.
[123.56s -> 126.50s]  Get as close to the middle point as you possibly can.
[126.50s -> 128.50s]  If you're not like in the gray,
[128.50s -> 132.41s]  then something's wrong.
[132.41s -> 134.41s]  I can't even fit.
[134.41s -> 138.82s]  Alright, so hold on.
[138.82s -> 140.82s]  On the count of three,
[140.82s -> 142.82s]  Alright, go. It's too late. Just go.
[145.96s -> 147.96s]  Oh, I'm gone.
[147.96s -> 149.96s]  I got taunt killed.
[149.96s -> 151.96s]  I got kicked off by a taunt.
[151.96s -> 153.96s]  You really did.
[153.96s -> 156.52s]  It's down to two.
[156.52s -> 159.21s]  Oh, there's one more contestant.
[159.21s -> 161.21s]  Oh, he's got a holiday punch.
[161.21s -> 163.21s]  Get him.
[163.21s -> 165.94s]  The crits are down.
[165.94s -> 167.94s]  What's gonna happen here is somebody's gonna detonate it first
[167.94s -> 169.94s]  when I say three.
[169.94s -> 171.94s]  And every single person in the room is gonna explode.
[171.94s -> 173.94s]  And then the crits server is gonna crash.
[173.94s -> 177.13s]  I'm looking forward to that.
[177.13s -> 179.13s]  Alright, that's it.
[179.13s -> 181.13s]  Alright, so everybody get in here.
[181.13s -> 183.13s]  Everybody get in here and don't move.
[183.13s -> 185.13s]  Don't do anything. Just marvel.
[185.13s -> 187.13s]  Marvel at the marbles that are all over the ground.
[189.69s -> 193.66s]  Everybody in here.
[193.66s -> 195.66s]  On the count of three,
[195.66s -> 197.66s]  somebody detonate their sticky bombs.
[197.66s -> 199.83s]  Are you ready?
[199.83s -> 203.02s]  One, two, three.
[203.02s -> 207.69s]  There's nobody.
[207.69s -> 209.69s]  I don't even know what happened.
[209.69s -> 211.69s]  I don't even know what happened.
[211.69s -> 213.69s]  I don't even know what happened.
[213.69s -> 215.69s]  The game, I couldn't handle that.
[215.69s -> 219.98s]  It just didn't understand.
[219.98s -> 225.99s]  Three, two, one.
[225.99s -> 229.50s]  Alright.
[229.50s -> 231.50s]  That's just too much.
[231.50s -> 237.26s]  What?
[237.26s -> 240.39s]  Oh, he keeps on getting healed.
[240.39s -> 242.39s]  I'm going heavy. Everybody's a threat.
[242.39s -> 245.72s]  I don't even care.
[245.72s -> 248.60s]  If I see person, I'm shooting person.
[248.60s -> 251.22s]  I think I just killed my own spy.
[255.13s -> 258.01s]  See,
[258.01s -> 260.01s]  trying to heal yourself with a power jack
[260.01s -> 262.01s]  is not, it doesn't work.
[262.01s -> 266.62s]  I love the chat.
[266.62s -> 268.62s]  This is dumb.
[268.62s -> 273.42s]  Somebody has to try to win the game.
[273.42s -> 275.42s]  But everybody's in there.
[278.49s -> 280.49s]  The second I say that, of course,
[280.49s -> 282.49s]  somebody just puts a shotgun
[282.49s -> 284.49s]  in somebody's face.
[284.49s -> 289.66s]  Look at these two going at it.
[289.66s -> 294.20s]  Look at these two going at it.
[294.20s -> 296.20s]  Get him. Get him.
[296.20s -> 298.20s]  Oh, there's a caper.
[298.20s -> 300.20s]  You capped it.
[300.20s -> 302.20s]  Somebody capped it.
[304.20s -> 306.20s]  I need to heal. I need to heal.
[306.20s -> 308.95s]  He just tried to kill you.
[308.95s -> 310.95s]  This sniper, you're so dead.
[310.95s -> 312.95s]  Two snipers.
[312.95s -> 314.95s]  Right now, this guy is going to shoot the first person.
[314.95s -> 316.95s]  Oh, he doesn't realize.
[316.95s -> 319.32s]  He doesn't realize the Huntsman doesn't hit teammates.
[319.32s -> 321.32s]  And these are just the flames from her.
[321.32s -> 323.32s]  GG.
[323.32s -> 326.58s]  I'm taking off the Tommy Slav.
[326.58s -> 331.00s]  I'm just going Brass Beast.
[331.00s -> 334.33s]  You can't light me on fire. It doesn't work.
[334.33s -> 336.33s]  Exit.
[336.33s -> 339.53s]  That was my exit strategy.
[339.53s -> 342.66s]  Make sure no one's following me.
[342.66s -> 347.21s]  All you son of a bitches are a threat.
[347.21s -> 349.96s]  Oh, no, no.
[349.96s -> 351.96s]  You were on the point.
[351.96s -> 353.96s]  I was like, where is everybody?
[353.96s -> 355.96s]  I'm walking outside. There's like three red soldiers trying to kill each other.
[355.96s -> 359.22s]  No!
[359.22s -> 361.22s]  Yes!
[361.22s -> 363.22s]  I'm getting told off by the AFK manager for not moving from spawn.
[363.22s -> 365.22s]  I can't get out of my spawn.
[365.22s -> 367.22s]  Why can't I not hit this guy?
[367.22s -> 371.06s]  What the hell was going on?
[371.06s -> 373.06s]  Wait, the AFK manager.
[373.06s -> 375.06s]  Seriously.
[375.06s -> 377.06s]  He's like, if you don't move from spawn soon,
[377.06s -> 379.06s]  you'll be moved to Specter.
[379.06s -> 381.06s]  I can't physically get out.
[381.06s -> 383.06s]  I can't get out.
[383.06s -> 385.06s]  You're going to get booted from the server because you can't move.
[385.06s -> 387.06s]  That's bullshit.
[387.06s -> 389.62s]  Oh, Pyro is the worst class to play.
[389.62s -> 391.62s]  Honestly, I don't even know why I'm disguising.
[391.62s -> 393.62s]  There's no point in disguising.
[393.62s -> 395.62s]  Oh, yeah, dude.
[395.62s -> 397.62s]  Your dead ringer will pop from teammates.
[397.62s -> 399.80s]  They can look kind of convincing, actually.
[399.80s -> 403.26s]  Good.
[403.26s -> 405.26s]  We got somebody on the cap.
[405.26s -> 407.26s]  What the hell is going on over here?
[407.26s -> 409.26s]  Why is this guy's clothing just over here?
[409.26s -> 413.98s]  No!
[413.98s -> 415.98s]  I got 7 HP. I'm good.
[415.98s -> 417.98s]  As long as one of my teammates doesn't show up,
[417.98s -> 419.98s]  I'll be okay.
