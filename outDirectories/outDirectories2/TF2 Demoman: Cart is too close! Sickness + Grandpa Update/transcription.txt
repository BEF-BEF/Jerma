[0.31s -> 21.70s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and tonight I'm gonna be playing as the Demoman with the Loose Cannon, the Sticky Bomb Launcher, and the Eyelander.
[21.70s -> 26.70s]  Don't know why the Eyelander was equipped. It didn't really help me out in this situation at all.
[26.70s -> 31.70s]  But before I start talking about the video, very quick video by the way, less than 4 minutes I think it is.
[31.70s -> 39.70s]  But I don't know if you can tell, but I'm pretty sick right now. If you can hear my voice, I sound like an old lady that like went through the dry cleaning machine.
[39.70s -> 45.70s]  Like she was on the dry cleaning machine, it was spinning around, and she was on it, and she came off talking like this.
[45.70s -> 49.70s]  But no, I've got the flu. I don't know how. I don't know where it came from.
[49.70s -> 58.70s]  I tell you right now, I haven't had a fever in over 10 years, and I woke up the other day with like a 101 or a 102 or something.
[58.70s -> 62.70s]  I was really damn sick, and you know when you get really sick and you're just sweating?
[62.70s -> 67.70s]  It's not even like, it's not like you stink or anything like that, but you just wake up in your bed and you're just, the bed is wet.
[67.70s -> 73.87s]  Like as if somebody dumped water on you when you were sleeping. That has been happening to me for at least the last couple of days.
[73.87s -> 84.87s]  And sorry for sharing those grotesque details with you guys, but I like to keep you guys in the loop, let you know what's going on with the channel, with me, etc. etc.
[84.87s -> 90.87s]  So we're going to talk about the video very briefly right now. This was a super overtime video.
[90.87s -> 92.87s]  This is on Hoodoo, by the way. We're on defense.
[92.87s -> 100.87s]  And this game, it just got down to the wire right here, and I was just cracking up laughing this entire freaking time.
[100.87s -> 105.87s]  Like it was just nonsense. If you want to talk about just like total chaos, this is total chaos.
[105.87s -> 110.87s]  They actually get the cart inside the door, almost to the point where it's touching.
[110.87s -> 115.87s]  Like I don't know if you could get any closer with the cart on any point as close as it gets right here.
[115.87s -> 120.87s]  And it goes to like a minute long overtime. I'm not going to spoil anything, but just going to let it play out in the background.
[120.87s -> 123.87s]  You can watch it. It's pretty funny, pretty chaotic, like I said.
[123.87s -> 128.87s]  But we are going to move on from that. There is something I do want to bring up in this video, something I do want to talk about.
[128.87s -> 135.87s]  And what I want to talk about is the grandpa face cam video or the grandpa face reveal video.
[135.87s -> 139.87s]  A lot of you guys are wondering where it is, and because I've been out of commission for a few days,
[139.87s -> 145.87s]  I haven't been able to really respond to many of these inquiries. Inquiries. There we go.
[145.87s -> 151.87s]  So the grandpa face cam is coming along very, very nicely. I'm going to tell you, it will be worth the wait.
[151.87s -> 158.05s]  And this is not going to be just as simple as, oh, grandpa has like a face cam in the corner of the screen,
[158.05s -> 164.05s]  and he's playing like Happy Wheels or something. No, no, no. This is going to be an entire production.
[164.05s -> 168.05s]  I want to make sure this video is done right. I want to make sure it is funny.
[168.05s -> 173.05s]  I want to make sure that things go well with the creation of the video and so on and so forth.
[173.05s -> 178.05s]  So if you're waiting for it, I'm sorry, but you're going to have to wait a little, little bit longer.
[178.05s -> 185.05s]  And I was trying to get it up by this weekend, but because I was like sweating with a fever in my bed for the last three or four days,
[185.05s -> 191.05s]  that's just not going to happen. So I'm not going to give a date. I don't want to give like a concrete date on this video
[191.05s -> 196.05s]  because it's too important of a video for me to just be like, yeah, it's going to go up on January 6th.
[196.05s -> 203.05s]  I'd rather get it done when it's done and upload it when it's ready. So I'm going to go on valve time right now, guys.
[203.05s -> 208.05s]  A lot of you are probably not going to want to hear that, but trust me, it will be worth the wait.
[208.05s -> 213.29s]  So I'm going to say my goodbyes now. Thank you so much for watching, guys. I really do appreciate it.
[213.29s -> 219.29s]  I'm going to hop back in bed and drink some more Pedialyte and eat some more soup with my hands.
[219.29s -> 224.29s]  So I'll see you guys all next time. Happy New Year, by the way. I don't think I actually said that.
[224.29s -> 229.29s]  I think I said it on Twitter back when it first happened, right when it got to like 11 o'clock or something.
[229.29s -> 234.29s]  I said it on Twitter, but Happy New Year, everybody. Let's hope for a good 2013 for all of you.
[234.29s -> 237.29s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
