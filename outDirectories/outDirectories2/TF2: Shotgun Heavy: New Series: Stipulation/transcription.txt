[0.31s -> 14.25s]  Hey, what's up, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary, and
[14.25s -> 19.73s]  tonight, I got a very special Team Fortress 2 upload tonight, because this is the start
[19.73s -> 24.39s]  of a new series I want to do. But let's back up for just a second here. I want to give
[24.39s -> 30.79s]  you guys the origin, I guess, of this series. So a long time ago, I did a video, well not
[30.79s -> 35.86s]  really a long time ago, more like maybe a month or so ago. I uploaded a Crusaders cross
[36.02s -> 40.82s]  bow medic bonus clip on top. I think it was a Huntsman sniper gameplay. But if you remember
[40.82s -> 46.98s]  that, I called it a stipulation match, where I was only allowed to use one item or two
[46.98s -> 51.58s]  items and it was a very strange way of doing things. And I believe in that one, it was
[51.58s -> 57.82s]  I could only use the crossbow to heal people or damage people. I could not use the medigun.
[57.82s -> 62.52s]  It was definitely a whole lot of fun. So I decided to turn it into a series. And this
[62.52s -> 69.60s]  is episode one of stipulation, where just like in that crossbow video, I'm only allowed
[69.60s -> 76.07s]  a certain set of rules or guidelines or item sets, and I have to stick to those rules.
[76.07s -> 79.91s]  So I'm going to start the series off with the heavy. And I really do first right off
[79.91s -> 85.23s]  the bat apologize for this, because it's been at least a month or two, at least that, since
[85.23s -> 89.77s]  my last heavy gameplay. And the reason why that is, is I just honestly don't really
[89.77s -> 93.73s]  play heavy that much anymore. I play them every now and then just kind of joking around
[93.73s -> 98.43s]  messing around. But I haven't really sat down to play heavy in a long time. But I did
[98.43s -> 102.60s]  it this time. So let's start talking about the stipulation you probably know what it
[102.60s -> 108.32s]  is by now by watching the screen. Only allowed to use the fists of steel and the family business
[108.32s -> 114.72s]  shotgun. I am not allowed to use that minigun. Minigun off limits. That is the stipulation.
[114.72s -> 120.33s]  And you'd actually be quite surprised that this setup does work very, very well. As you're
[120.33s -> 124.99s]  seeing in this gameplay, I'm killing quite a few people. And I've only died one time.
[124.99s -> 128.67s]  So if you guys are liking what you're seeing here, and you want to try this out on your
[128.67s -> 133.88s]  own sometime, this is the strategy I was using. You want to walk around with the fists of
[133.88s -> 139.52s]  steel up pretty much at all times. The only times you want to drop the fists of steel
[139.52s -> 143.94s]  is if you get close enough to shoot someone with your shotgun. And you can also duke people
[143.94s -> 147.48s]  out and fake people out. You'll see coming up here, me and this pyro get into it. And
[147.64s -> 151.76s]  so often I'll bring up the fists of steel. Because if you don't know, the fists of steel
[151.76s -> 156.92s]  absorb 40% of the damage you take. When you have them up, that is. So this setup really,
[156.92s -> 160.82s]  it's not that bad. If you can time when people are going to shoot at you, and then after
[160.82s -> 164.50s]  they're out of ammo or they're running out of ammo, like a soldier for instance, let's
[164.50s -> 168.34s]  say he shoots two or three rockets at you while you have these things active. And you
[168.34s -> 172.68s]  absorb a lot of that damage. You only have one rocket to worry about now. So you can
[172.68s -> 177.08s]  just put these things down, whip up the shotgun, put the guy full of lead and he might miss
[177.28s -> 181.48s]  you, or he might hit you and it might not kill you. So definitely, definitely give this
[181.48s -> 186.76s]  a try. It is a whole lot of fun. It takes you out of that typical heavy gameplay where
[186.76s -> 192.55s]  you pull down the minigun and just brrrrr. It takes you out of that. It's also going
[192.55s -> 196.95s]  to give you a reason to put on that shotgun. Because let's face it guys, let's be totally
[196.95s -> 202.81s]  honest, not very many people use the shotgun as the heavy. Nobody, especially the family
[202.81s -> 208.01s]  business, my goodness. This thing pretty much collects dust in everybody's cabinets. So
[208.01s -> 213.10s]  definitely give it a try. Take the sandwich off for once and just go out and have fun.
[213.10s -> 217.22s]  You probably just saw the top frag in that last gameplay right there. I really didn't
[217.22s -> 221.78s]  top frag. I was playing as a different class earlier in that round and the round was going
[221.78s -> 226.18s]  on forever and I just decided, okay, let's just do this now. I'm going to do the heavy
[226.18s -> 231.66s]  with the shotgun and the fist of steel. I think I was actually playing as a sniper earlier.
[231.66s -> 237.45s]  So just disregard that. So let's talk about the gameplay for a second here. I'm currently
[237.45s -> 242.37s]  stuck inside of this building right now because there's a heavy outside and I think MLC Stealth
[242.37s -> 246.09s]  just got the backstab on and we were in Skype and he's like, oh, I got that heavy and I
[246.33s -> 251.61s]  went, oh, thank God, because as the stipulation goes, I would have just got my ass totally
[251.61s -> 257.52s]  handed to me right there. So thank you MLC Stealth for saving my life. I get behind these
[257.52s -> 261.84s]  two guys right here, kill the soldier with my fists of steel and then I put the Pyro
[261.84s -> 265.60s]  six feet under as well, kill him with the shotgun, jump around here to the corner. I
[265.60s -> 269.28s]  go down in that building again, just trying to get some more health and some more ammo,
[269.28s -> 273.24s]  even though I don't really need the ammo. So at this point I'm thinking maybe I should
[273.24s -> 278.30s]  get on that cart. I don't know why I thought this was a good idea. Maybe I just forgot
[278.30s -> 282.30s]  that I couldn't use my minigun because I see this Pyro and then watch, I get air blasted
[282.30s -> 287.02s]  almost off the cliff. Oh my God, it almost happens twice. I don't know how I ended up
[287.02s -> 292.62s]  surviving that. I should have gone right off of that goddamn cliff, but the gods of Hightower
[292.62s -> 297.01s]  were on my side at that point. So coming up to the end of the gameplay here, I'm checking
[297.01s -> 300.57s]  this spy over and over again. I don't know why I could have just bumped into him. Like
[300.57s -> 305.30s]  are you a spy? No, are you a spy? No, he's not. I get a lucky crit on this Pyro, pull
[305.30s -> 310.62s]  up the fist of steel and shab-bam right in his face and then I get the karma because
[310.62s -> 316.23s]  I get crit right in my face. So that is going to be the end of this gameplay, guys. Thank
[316.23s -> 320.65s]  you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. Just wanted to showcase another
[320.65s -> 325.21s]  small clip, I guess, of using this setup. And if you have any suggestions, if you guys
[325.21s -> 330.85s]  want to see a certain stipulation, then definitely, definitely drop me a comment and we'll go
[330.85s -> 336.26s]  from there. So thanks guys again. I'll see you all soon and take care everybody.
