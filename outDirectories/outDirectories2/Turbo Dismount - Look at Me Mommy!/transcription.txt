[0.31s -> 15.98s]  Going over your morning commute right now, we've got traffic on the threes, which looks like it could be letting up by about 4 or 5 p.m. tonight.
[15.98s -> 19.98s]  I would suggest taking a different route, but we got an accident on route 45, and hopefully...
[19.98s -> 22.98s]  What's this? Oh my god, a person!
[22.98s -> 39.94s]  Hey everybody, welcome to another video starring me, German985.
[39.94s -> 45.94s]  I've got a really interesting thing to show you. It's how I drive cars now. It's pretty fun.
[45.94s -> 56.62s]  Here we go. Oh yeah, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5. Coming soon. Coming soon, DVD.
[57.62s -> 60.12s]  Jesus Christ.
[63.92s -> 72.92s]  This is nothing like riding a tricycle on a Sunday afternoon. Hey, look at me, mommy. I'm so cute.
[75.25s -> 81.75s]  Inside of a Mack truck? Oh, you gotta be shitting me. This ain't gonna end well.
[81.75s -> 89.70s]  This is gonna be real bad. Oh, fuck the fuck. That sucked.
[89.70s -> 102.03s]  Okay, we'll put a big ramp right here. Let's go. Let's do it. Big ramp. Hold on for dear life.
[102.03s -> 106.03s]  Because we're going over the goddamn ramp. That's not what I wanted to have happen.
[106.03s -> 115.13s]  For some how I landed that. Broken bones everywhere. I don't know how that just happened. Let's do it!
[115.13s -> 122.21s]  Go. Go. Go.
[122.21s -> 128.82s]  And just like that, he was never heard from again.
[128.82s -> 136.17s]  So are you sure this is safe? I'm positive. Just do it, you baby.
[136.17s -> 141.17s]  Okay, well I guess I'll try. Weee!
[141.17s -> 146.43s]  Looks like you're gonna be fighting a little bit of construction on Route 24 coming on the bridge there.
[146.43s -> 155.14s]  What the fuck even happened? Are you serious? I didn't even do anything. He didn't do anything.
[155.14s -> 170.32s]  What just happened? I broke my neck on the dashboard. Okay.
[170.32s -> 177.32s]  You know son, it was on this very bridge that your mother proposed to me. I mean, I proposed to your mother.
[177.32s -> 181.32s]  She looked so pretty in her red dress. Fucking come on!
[181.32s -> 189.75s]  Did I ever tell you son, when I proposed to your mother on this very bridge, we were both young and restless.
[189.75s -> 194.75s]  And I said, sweetie, I love you so much. Can we please get married?
[194.75s -> 197.93s]  And if I miss this again, I'm gonna fucking scream.
[197.93s -> 201.93s]  It was this very bridge where I proposed to your mother.
[201.93s -> 209.30s]  She looked so pretty in her red dress and I said, son, would you like to get married?
[209.30s -> 215.18s]  No, there's a fire. There's a fire somewhere. We're gonna bring the fire engine. I think there's a fire.
[215.18s -> 217.18s]  There could be a fire over here.
[217.18s -> 221.18s]  It's this highway right here. This is the one son. You gotta be careful. You're only a student driver.
[221.18s -> 226.18s]  You gotta watch out for the goddamn animals. There's birds and bears cross this bridge all the time.
[226.18s -> 234.44s]  So please just be careful. Look out son! There goes one now!
[234.44s -> 241.92s]  Why did mummy not want me to play in the street? She said not to play in the street, but why? It's so much fun.
[241.92s -> 249.15s]  Fuck! That would have been perfect.
[249.15s -> 255.03s]  I can't wait to show my mummy my new skateboard move. She told me not to play in the street, but I don't care.
[255.03s -> 262.78s]  Mummy, let me see. Maybe I can show mummy my new skateboard move. Look, I'm just flying down like Superman.
[262.78s -> 271.44s]  Check it out. You're going for 20 points.
[271.44s -> 273.83s]  20 points.
[273.83s -> 282.48s]  Yeah, my boyfriend's so badass. He's in a biker gang. He buys me presents all the time.
[282.48s -> 286.48s]  You wish you had a boyfriend like mine. Just wait till he shows up to say, to say, fuck you.
[286.48s -> 291.49s]  And he fucking fell off again. I really hope this works.
[291.49s -> 295.49s]  I've done this like eight times and it keeps on falling off the bike like a dipshit.
[295.49s -> 300.49s]  Somebody get this dipshit, a driver's license that is capable for a motorcycle.
[300.49s -> 303.49s]  Here he comes. Here he comes. Come on. Come on now.
[303.49s -> 309.49s]  You did it. You did it, my son.
