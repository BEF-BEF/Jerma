[0.31s -> 15.70s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with Nightmare House 2 for Scare Saturdays.
[15.70s -> 22.86s]  Alright, let me put my headphones in now, at least in one of the ears.
[22.86s -> 28.86s]  This is Scare Saturdays, this is Nightmare House 2. This is a Half-Life 2 Episode 2 mod.
[28.86s -> 34.86s]  A lot of people get confused sometimes. You have to have Half-Life 2 Episode 2 to play this game.
[34.86s -> 37.86s]  It is free, the link will be in the description, all that good stuff.
[37.86s -> 44.28s]  And it's fairly long, too. This might take me at least 5 or 6 episodes to play through the whole thing.
[44.28s -> 47.28s]  Probably a little bit more. We will see how this goes.
[47.28s -> 54.15s]  But, Nightmare House Prologue, I guess? Or should we just skip to Chapter 1?
[54.15s -> 58.54s]  Oh, we're skipping right to Chapter 1. Here we go, baby.
[58.54s -> 65.68s]  I probably shouldn't have done that. What if it was like, oh, this is the secret code you need to know to get into the first level?
[65.68s -> 69.50s]  I'm in my little cell here with my marshmallows on the sides.
[69.50s -> 79.59s]  Okay, it looks like the door. Is there anything in here I need to know?
[79.59s -> 92.18s]  Okay, Chapter 1 Rebirth. Should I just go this way?
[92.18s -> 96.70s]  This hallway is dark, so I'm assuming I just have to go this way.
[96.70s -> 101.99s]  Oh, my brain, you're hurting my brain with that. I can't open that door, let's just go.
[101.99s -> 109.33s]  Dive! Right off the bat, are you serious? The first second.
[109.33s -> 125.20s]  Oh my god, come on, dude. I'm not calm. I never have been calm, I'm getting out of here.
[125.20s -> 136.54s]  Is there a run? Can I sprint? Anything over here? A lot of blood.
[136.54s -> 141.93s]  Wait, I just saw like a twinkle. I just saw a twinkle. What was that?
[141.93s -> 149.89s]  Do I have like a flashlight or something? I don't. Security room.
[149.89s -> 159.19s]  All right. That does not look good. There's the flashlight. That's what I wanted.
[159.19s -> 164.63s]  Hey, you're looking at it. It's me on a webcam. A webcam-ception.
[164.63s -> 178.58s]  Am I locked in this room right now? What the hell? How do I get out of here?
[178.58s -> 184.03s]  Oh, okay. Like I said, just remove the lock. Good to know.
[184.03s -> 199.65s]  Hey, I thought you turned the lock off, you B-I-T-C-H. Locked in, it seems.
[199.65s -> 204.69s]  Is the kitchen over here? Looks like it.
[204.69s -> 215.65s]  Oh, damn. Oh, man. Chef Boyardee had a bad day today.
[215.65s -> 223.10s]  Anything else in here? I got it. I got the axe, now what?
[231.46s -> 246.30s]  Oh, god. Oh my- Is he dead now? Those bastards, man.
[246.30s -> 255.70s]  That seriously hurt my whole body. Oh, remember, I have an axe. Nobody can hurt me, I have an axe.
[255.70s -> 266.48s]  Oh, god. Which way do I go? I don't know where to go.
[266.48s -> 274.44s]  Oh, I don't like this game. God, no!
[274.44s -> 282.48s]  The bathroom is full of blood. That's disgusting. Can I break this? I can.
[282.48s -> 289.15s]  Any more cafeteria workers that are going to come out and punch me in the face?
[289.15s -> 295.75s]  Jump! Hooray. All right. Made it up.
[295.75s -> 300.87s]  I don't like vents. I do not like vents. Screw you, vents.
[300.87s -> 304.18s]  Something's going to just run right at me right now.
[305.18s -> 308.54s]  Don't look behind you. Don't look behind you. Don't look behind you.
[308.54s -> 312.36s]  Oh my god. Oh my god. I don't want to look behind me.
[312.36s -> 316.48s]  I did it anyways.
[322.97s -> 328.54s]  God damn.
[332.46s -> 334.96s]  Get me in this door. What's in here?
[334.96s -> 343.30s]  Hey, eat computer screen, whatever you are up there.
[343.30s -> 348.38s]  It's a button, I think. Come on, I'm pressing the buttons.
[348.38s -> 351.62s]  Oh, give me the gun. Give me the gun. Give me the gun.
[351.62s -> 356.75s]  Oh, for the love of god, please don't even tell me that something's going to jump through this door right now.
[356.75s -> 358.99s]  What the hell?
[358.99s -> 362.74s]  Oh, why did I shot the screen?
[362.74s -> 366.37s]  I shot at the screen.
[366.37s -> 375.70s]  Okay.
[375.70s -> 385.17s]  I'm losing my brain here.
[385.17s -> 393.29s]  All right, well, I'm going to shoot the absolute crap out of anything that comes near me.
[393.29s -> 396.29s]  If that guy comes near me, he's going to die. Hope he knows that.
[396.29s -> 399.49s]  Get me out of here.
[399.49s -> 401.92s]  Unlock the door. You said you're going to...
[408.28s -> 413.14s]  What the hell is that?
[415.14s -> 418.14s]  Where's my flashlight? Where's my flashlight?
[418.14s -> 422.67s]  Die, bitch.
[422.67s -> 425.67s]  Oh, god. Oh, god.
[431.67s -> 434.67s]  I just wasted like 10 rounds.
[434.67s -> 442.20s]  God, this game is tough to play.
[445.62s -> 454.14s]  All right, well, chapter two.
[454.14s -> 457.14s]  I think I might call it right here for this episode.
[458.89s -> 465.46s]  Oh, come on. I was about to say goodbye.
[465.46s -> 467.46s]  All right. Oh, my god.
[467.46s -> 474.58s]  Am I falling right now? Where am I going?
[474.58s -> 478.81s]  I need the axe.
[479.81s -> 484.76s]  Dude, dude, come on.
[484.76s -> 487.76s]  Okay, so how am I falling up?
[487.76s -> 493.14s]  God damn.
[493.14s -> 496.78s]  Okay, I will see you.
[496.78s -> 499.78s]  What the hell is going on with this frigging elevator?
[499.78s -> 509.05s]  All right.
[509.05s -> 512.05s]  So I'll see you guys. I'll see you guys all next time for chapter two.
[512.05s -> 514.05s]  And take care, everybody. I'll see you all soon. Bye.
[514.05s -> 516.05s]  Peace, love, resp...
[517.05s -> 518.05s]  Bye.
