[3.45s -> 13.17s]  Hey what is happening guys, it's Germa again with a gameplay commentary.
[13.17s -> 17.17s]  This time we are on Payload Race Pipeline, which is one of the better maps in Team Fortress 2.
[17.17s -> 23.17s]  Unfortunately nobody plays it, so if you ever are in your server browser and you see Pipeline,
[23.17s -> 27.17s]  double click it because I promise you it is one of the funner maps in Team Fortress 2.
[27.17s -> 33.60s]  And for those of you new players, Payload Race Pipeline is essentially the same exact thing as a Gold Rush or a Badwater.
[33.60s -> 40.60s]  The only difference is the first person to push their cart to the very end of the track wins the game.
[40.60s -> 44.60s]  And you'll see there is just absolute chaos. Once the two carts reach the middle,
[44.60s -> 49.60s]  once one cart is right next to the other cart, it gets absolutely insane.
[49.60s -> 54.60s]  And it's a whole lot of fun, so I highly recommend it. Play it if you see it, it's a lot of fun.
[54.60s -> 60.60s]  And real quickly I want to thank everybody, not only from my YouTube channel, but all the guys on the Respawn Army app.
[60.60s -> 64.60s]  You guys have been so, so supportive and so helpful. Really thank you so much.
[64.60s -> 70.60s]  There's nothing else I could say besides thank you so much for all your support. It really means a lot to me guys.
[70.60s -> 77.60s]  So let's get this gameplay started. Playing as the Engineer with the default sentry gun, the Frontier Justice and the pistol.
[77.60s -> 82.60s]  Just trying to get this dispenser up on the front line so people, if they need to, can run back and get healed.
[82.60s -> 86.60s]  I'm very, very aggressive when I play Engineer on these types of maps.
[86.60s -> 91.60s]  So if you're looking at it and you're saying, Jerma, what are you doing? Don't move your sentry. Just keep it there.
[91.60s -> 96.60s]  Oh my god. I like to move very, very quickly, so I'm sorry if that upsets anybody.
[96.60s -> 101.60s]  Anyways, our team has a real commanding lead at this point. We have an uber heavy on the cart.
[101.60s -> 106.60s]  I know now it's safe enough to be able to move my sentry and my dispenser up to that point up here.
[106.60s -> 110.60s]  This is a great place. If you're going to play Engineer on this map, put your sentry right here.
[110.60s -> 113.60s]  There's no better place in the world because this is the crossroads.
[113.60s -> 116.60s]  This is the point where everybody has to come by at some point.
[116.60s -> 122.60s]  The only people that aren't going to come by this point on the other team is somebody that's a spy or a scout that ran the other direction.
[122.60s -> 128.60s]  Everybody has to push this cart at some point, and me and this other Engineer have this place on total lockdown.
[128.60s -> 132.84s]  Kills a couple of people right off the bat, and I want to bring up something really important.
[132.84s -> 135.84s]  You probably shouldn't build this close to another Engineer.
[135.84s -> 139.84s]  See how I had my sentry when this guy kind of came over and dropped his sentry right near mine?
[139.84s -> 144.84s]  It's not a good idea. You want to build your sentries at least 15 feet apart from each other
[144.84s -> 149.84s]  only because if a Demoman were to show up right now, like an uber Demoman or an uber Pyro,
[149.84s -> 154.84s]  things would get really, really ugly, and we potentially could lose both of the sentries.
[154.84s -> 158.84s]  So make sure you stay as spread out as you possibly can.
[158.84s -> 162.14s]  I saw this spy backstab the Medic, so I knew he was a spy.
[162.14s -> 167.14s]  He's using the Eternal Reward, which if you don't know, when you backstab somebody with that particular knife,
[167.14s -> 170.14s]  it makes you disguise instantly as that person.
[170.14s -> 176.14s]  And now you are going to see the Super Engineer and one of the biggest feats of strength ever.
[176.14s -> 178.14s]  Well, not ever, but it's really cool.
[178.14s -> 181.14s]  I turn this corner, I see there's an uber there, I have my revenge crits.
[181.14s -> 184.38s]  They don't kill the Teleporter.
[184.38s -> 186.38s]  Take a look at the top left part of the screen.
[186.38s -> 189.38s]  They didn't kill the Teleporter, and they're making a huge push right now.
[189.38s -> 193.62s]  Watch what Super German Engineer ends up doing right here.
[193.62s -> 197.62s]  This isn't even built yet. It finally ends up getting built, and I sneak onto it.
[197.62s -> 199.62s]  They don't even know it's here, and look at this.
[199.62s -> 202.62s]  Bang, you're dead. Hey, what's going on, Demoman?
[202.62s -> 205.62s]  You're dead, and then you are dead as well, Heavy.
[205.62s -> 208.62s]  And that was a complete and total screw up on their part,
[208.62s -> 212.62s]  because if they had just seen that Teleporter, that definitely would not have happened.
[212.62s -> 216.62s]  And now we are back where we were, and this Teleporter is getting upgraded.
[216.62s -> 219.62s]  They destroy the sentry, it's okay, I don't care.
[219.62s -> 221.62s]  I actually turn this, this is definitely a spy, how you doing?
[221.62s -> 224.62s]  Nice lucky crit I get on them, but I get this Teleporter to level 3,
[224.62s -> 227.62s]  which means that my teammates don't even have to walk an inch.
[227.62s -> 230.62s]  They can come right to the front lines instantly.
[230.62s -> 233.62s]  And I turn this corner, it's actually kind of funny, there's an AFK Medic.
[233.62s -> 235.62s]  That's just kind of, I don't even know if he was AFKing on it,
[235.62s -> 237.62s]  maybe he was like typing to somebody.
[237.62s -> 239.62s]  But I end up coming out around the corner, you'll see, here he is.
[239.62s -> 242.62s]  Just, one, two, three, and you're dead.
[242.62s -> 244.80s]  Coming back here just to make sure all my stuff is in order,
[244.80s -> 247.80s]  I saw that my Teleporter needed to be repaired.
[247.80s -> 250.80s]  Sentry gets an assist, and I come over to repair my Teleporter,
[250.80s -> 253.80s]  and now listen guys, you really have to think about this,
[253.80s -> 257.80s]  I can't stress this enough, if that Teleporter was destroyed,
[257.80s -> 261.34s]  back two minutes ago, this would have never happened,
[261.34s -> 264.34s]  and we potentially could have lost.
[264.34s -> 267.34s]  I'm going to stress this right now, if you see a Teleporter,
[267.34s -> 270.34s]  even if it's not built, if it's not swirling around,
[270.34s -> 272.65s]  if it's just kind of sitting there not built all the way up,
[272.65s -> 274.65s]  get rid of it, destroy it.
[274.65s -> 276.65s]  Make sure it's your number one priority to get rid of it,
[276.65s -> 279.65s]  because situations like this are going to happen,
[279.65s -> 282.65s]  where all the team is now up on the front lines,
[282.65s -> 284.65s]  we're all here, we're all pushing,
[284.65s -> 286.65s]  and then I do something crazy again,
[286.65s -> 288.65s]  people are going to rage about this, but I don't care,
[288.65s -> 290.65s]  at this point I knew we had it in the bag,
[290.65s -> 293.65s]  so I bring my Sentry out to the front of their spawn,
[293.65s -> 296.65s]  and this actually is one of the reasons why we win the game,
[296.65s -> 298.65s]  so before you hate on me and say this is a bad idea,
[298.65s -> 301.65s]  just watch, there's an Uber on the cart,
[301.65s -> 303.65s]  and they're so distracted by it that I can get it built in time,
[303.65s -> 306.65s]  and then here we go, deaths all around,
[306.65s -> 308.65s]  people that come out of the spawn are instantly killed,
[308.65s -> 310.65s]  they can't even do anything,
[310.65s -> 312.65s]  it kills about four, maybe three, four, five people,
[312.65s -> 314.65s]  I don't even remember it was so much,
[314.65s -> 316.65s]  and anyways we win the game,
[316.65s -> 318.65s]  I was on the top of the scoreboard,
[318.65s -> 321.65s]  awesome, awesome time, awesome game, awesome map too,
[321.65s -> 322.65s]  thank you all for watching,
[322.65s -> 324.65s]  thank you for your continued support,
[324.65s -> 326.65s]  and I appreciate everything guys,
[326.65s -> 328.65s]  thank you, take care.
