[0.31s -> 13.63s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a new Little Gems.
[13.63s -> 18.63s]  Now, this has been a long time since the last Little Gems, and I do apologize for that.
[18.63s -> 23.63s]  But, I finally got the hardware necessary to be able to record off my iPad.
[23.63s -> 30.63s]  If you followed this series, you'll know I had a lot of problems with trying to get games off the iPad, off the iPhone, and Android.
[30.63s -> 33.94s]  It was a real journey, we'll just say that.
[33.94s -> 38.94s]  And if you're wondering what I'm using, what capture device I'm using, I'm using a Game Capture HD.
[38.94s -> 42.94s]  It's from Elgato. Very easy to set up, very easy to use, and it works like a charm.
[42.94s -> 49.94s]  As you're seeing on the screen, you can actually see this iPad footage, and the sound is included, so two big thumbs up to Elgato.
[49.94s -> 53.94s]  And with that, we are going to move on here and talk about Spellsword.
[53.94s -> 59.75s]  So what Spellsword is, it is an action adventure platforming RPG death arena game.
[59.75s -> 64.75s]  That is a mouthful, but let me just compare this to a game that already exists.
[64.75s -> 69.75s]  Super Crate Box. If you like Super Crate Box, you will absolutely love this game.
[69.75s -> 76.75s]  Now, replace the gun mechanic in Super Crate Box and use these card mechanics and a sword in Spellsword.
[76.75s -> 81.25s]  So the game breaks down like this. There are four maps to choose from.
[81.25s -> 86.25s]  Each one of these maps is going to have 20 levels to play on, and an endless mode.
[86.25s -> 93.74s]  Now, obviously, you cannot complete endless mode. Endless mode is just for you to play on and last as long as you can,
[93.74s -> 96.74s]  defending yourself from waves and waves and waves of these enemies.
[96.74s -> 99.74s]  And you get money as well, but we'll talk about money later.
[99.74s -> 105.05s]  But when you load up a regular level, 1 through 20, it's going to give you a certain specific task.
[105.05s -> 111.05s]  Whether that be kill a certain amount of enemies to complete the zone, or collect a certain amount of these cards,
[111.05s -> 116.05s]  or last a certain amount of seconds, anything like that is going to be your objective.
[116.05s -> 121.42s]  When you load up one of these missions. So how do you kill enemies? What do you do? What's the actual point?
[121.42s -> 125.42s]  Why is the game called Spellsword? Well, let's get into the card mechanics.
[125.42s -> 132.42s]  In each level, there's going to be random spawns of these cards. All you have as a weapon is just a sword.
[132.42s -> 138.42s]  You can slash enemies, it does damage, but the real way to kill these enemies and the real way to progress in the missions
[138.42s -> 142.42s]  is to collect these cards and to upgrade these cards.
[142.42s -> 146.85s]  There's no activation button, you just simply touch them and they will do their ability.
[146.85s -> 152.85s]  And the abilities range from ice shields and ice lances, to fireballs that cover the whole screen,
[152.85s -> 156.85s]  to invisibility and invulnerability, there's a lot here.
[156.85s -> 159.85s]  And it just happens to randomly pop up on the screen.
[159.85s -> 164.85s]  You cannot decipher what card is going to come up, it just is going to come up and you have to grab it.
[164.85s -> 170.15s]  Now this makes for some really, really good chaotic gameplay, where you are constantly jumping around,
[170.15s -> 175.15s]  double jumping, grabbing this card, grabbing that card, oh fire bomb, oh my god, poison cloud.
[175.15s -> 179.15s]  It gets really, really hectic, which is the best part about the game.
[179.15s -> 182.15s]  It's just so much fun in its little chaotic atmosphere.
[182.15s -> 188.15s]  And on top of all of this, there is an entire upgrade system and item system in this game.
[188.15s -> 192.15s]  There are hats in this game, you heard it here, there are hats in this game.
[192.15s -> 195.15s]  So that should be enough for you to go download it.
[195.15s -> 200.15s]  Anyways, there is an entire upgrade tree, where you spend money that you get from doing missions,
[200.15s -> 204.15s]  from killing enemies, they're little rupees they land on the ground, you've probably seen them in the video.
[204.15s -> 209.65s]  And you use that money to buy upgrades to your various things, and it's so addicting.
[209.65s -> 214.65s]  I have spent a lot of time in this game so far, and I still, there's a lot of things I have not upgraded.
[214.65s -> 219.65s]  It takes a lot of money in the later levels to upgrade some of these cards to their fullest.
[219.65s -> 223.95s]  But you are going to need it though, if you plan on doing any endless mode stuff,
[223.95s -> 227.95s]  there are three different difficulties on the endless mode, it's easy, normal, and hard.
[227.95s -> 232.95s]  And if you want to do hard, and you want to last a long time, you're going to want these upgrades.
[232.95s -> 235.19s]  It's going to help you immensely.
[235.19s -> 240.19s]  But now let's talk about the price point of this game, and is it worth it, should you go download it right now?
[240.19s -> 245.19s]  The answer is yes, because just recently, this game went free to play.
[245.19s -> 253.19s]  This game is a free download right now for iPad and iPhone, it's on the iTunes store right now, and it is an absolute steal.
[253.19s -> 258.19s]  I highly recommend this game, if you like these quirky little action RPG type games,
[258.19s -> 262.19s]  where you kill a lot of things, you upgrade a lot of stuff, then this is the game for you.
[262.19s -> 267.56s]  Also, because the game just recently went free to play, they introduced a monetized system,
[267.56s -> 273.56s]  so there's now an in-game store where you can buy rupees, you can buy these things called dragon coins.
[273.56s -> 278.74s]  They added a lot of stuff in this 1.1 update they did not too long ago.
[278.74s -> 282.74s]  But that's going to wrap up the video guys, thank you so much for watching, I really do appreciate it.
[282.74s -> 285.74s]  And go have fun with this game, it's free baby!
[285.74s -> 289.74s]  And I'll see you guys all next time, and of course, take care everybody.
