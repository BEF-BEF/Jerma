[0.31s -> 14.50s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here and Boo. Hello. Playing some smite.
[14.50s -> 23.48s]  Gonna be a live commentary. Gonna showcase Apollo, the god of music. Now don't ask me why.
[23.48s -> 28.48s]  Apollo is the god of way more things than just like music. But they kind of have to put that there.
[28.48s -> 37.51s]  Because there's way too many things he could be. Let's go. Where are we going? Right. Okay.
[37.51s -> 47.14s]  Oh, but bro. Oh, come on, Cupid. Don't do this to us. Did they want to go right?
[47.14s -> 56.54s]  Well, Aokwong is mid. What? Are we gonna have like a party over here? What did he say?
[56.54s -> 61.54s]  I think he's going left. What the hell is he talking about? I don't even know.
[61.54s -> 65.54s]  I think he wanted to go with this Aokwong. Like I think they might be premade. Yeah.
[65.54s -> 71.41s]  Or maybe not. I don't even know. I just want to get a piece of cake from the cake slug.
[71.41s -> 88.42s]  Who's getting this? You take this. Okay. I hope this tornado doesn't just kill him.
[88.42s -> 97.09s]  Alright. Thank you. Let's do it. You know the speed buff now gives you attack speed as well.
[97.09s -> 103.08s]  Oh yeah, it does. 10%. Which is why it's better for the physical guys to take it.
[103.08s -> 108.51s]  Especially for ranged because you can just pop the minions easier. Yeah, they did that a little while ago, right?
[109.51s -> 112.51s]  Yeah, it was last month or something like that.
[112.51s -> 116.51s]  So for those of you that have no idea who Apollo is, he's the newest god.
[116.51s -> 119.94s]  If you're watching... Oh, watch out, Ragney. If you're watching this...
[119.94s -> 129.28s]  Jeez. What the... Okay. Ragney's scary, level one. Yeah, she is. She's aggressive.
[129.28s -> 132.28s]  She also doesn't got a whole lot of health now, does she?
[132.28s -> 135.28s]  She'll probably regenerate back. Does she have any potions? I don't know.
[135.28s -> 137.28s]  Yeah, she has two health potions.
[137.28s -> 141.28s]  So what I was saying before, Ragney just tried to smoke me.
[141.28s -> 145.28s]  Apollo is the newest god. If you're watching this right now and like six other gods have been out by then,
[145.28s -> 151.82s]  then I apologize, but he's ranged. He's pretty powerful. He's got a lot of utility.
[151.82s -> 156.73s]  I'll try and give you some speed. It should be okay. I got Creeping Cursed.
[156.73s -> 167.80s]  Okay. Yeah, he's probably my favorite god at this point. I just love the sounds.
[168.80s -> 176.84s]  Get out of here. This guy. These guys are super aggressive. They are very aggressive, yes.
[176.84s -> 182.30s]  She's probably going to take our cooldown, right? Yeah, most probably.
[182.30s -> 194.11s]  That's our cooldown, Ragney. What the hell? Oh crap. I'm not a man in here.
[194.11s -> 204.37s]  So I guess try not to stand on our minions because Hades will want to dash you and that'll sting a bit.
[204.37s -> 214.74s]  It really will. She's going to have her pulse soon. We can do one more anyway before she gets it.
[214.74s -> 224.98s]  Should have got Hand. I should have got Hand of the Gods. Take those away.
[225.98s -> 231.04s]  She's looking. Yeah, she's right here. She's right here. She's literally right here.
[231.04s -> 234.86s]  I don't have my dash yet, but Hades is coming. We might build it.
[234.86s -> 238.31s]  We can fight Hades. No, she's here. She's here. She's here.
[238.31s -> 242.74s]  I still don't have my dash yet. I don't know why I got my fear first. I was very stupid over here.
[242.74s -> 249.83s]  Do you think Ragney's going to come back? Yes, she is. She's ahead of us.
[249.83s -> 259.53s]  So those of you wondering, when I hit 10 auto attacks, I get to shoot five that are really, really fast.
[259.53s -> 265.77s]  Just like this. Oh boy, there she is. And I'm silenced.
[265.77s -> 272.68s]  They're diving. No, they're diving. I'm going to go down.
[272.68s -> 275.68s]  No, you're good. You're good. Just kill that spider. There you go.
[275.68s -> 281.30s]  Hades did not ult you. No, he's not five yet. Okay.
[281.30s -> 288.94s]  Ragney's out of mana. Ooh, you going in? Careful. Oh boy, here she goes.
[288.94s -> 294.77s]  Oh no, no, no, no. We got a Ragney.
[294.77s -> 300.77s]  I threw an auto attack on her. Oh no, I tried to hit F4 and I hit F3.
[300.77s -> 306.27s]  Is that your... Oh, you didn't get back up your ult. God damn it.
[306.27s -> 315.03s]  One thing about this keyboard I don't like is if I hit any of the F keys, I feel like I'm pressing all of them at the same time.
[315.03s -> 322.97s]  It's quite annoying. But yeah, I threw an auto attack at her and she just jumped right on top of you right when it happened.
[322.97s -> 329.73s]  I'm not going to do it yet though. Let me know when you want to go in because I'll pop girdle.
[329.73s -> 337.04s]  Stay away from the minions. Hades is a piece of crap. Oh, well, you're Hades too. Whoops.
[337.04s -> 345.76s]  Yeah, but I'm a cool looking Hades. He's just a jump default skin Hades.
[345.76s -> 349.37s]  That's in the middle. That's only Archon. I'm not too scared of Archon.
[349.37s -> 353.18s]  What's he going in? What's he doing? Well, he's taking a lot of minion damage for this.
[353.18s -> 362.59s]  Yeah, he sure is. Ragney's right behind. Nice job. Oh, now she knocked her up.
[362.59s -> 367.22s]  I'll fear her. Let's kill her. Let's kill her. Yeah, she's not going to get away.
[372.36s -> 377.54s]  Oh, so much damage. I had to Aegis otherwise she was going to kill me.
[377.54s -> 381.54s]  I was about five mana away from smacking the ground with my three and I would have killed her.
[381.54s -> 387.60s]  I just didn't have enough. I was unlucky. Good exchange.
[387.60s -> 394.35s]  Hades, when he dashed, he went to just go slam on minions, but my fear was ranked up and he couldn't do it.
[394.35s -> 399.30s]  He just took a bunch of archer damage for it and his dash was down so I might as well ult him.
[399.30s -> 410.29s]  That's true. God, there's so many minions. So many minions.
[410.29s -> 413.59s]  How's everyone else doing? Oh, they're doing pretty good. Nine and four.
[413.59s -> 420.46s]  Alcong's holding up mid. He's two and one. Left lane. Cupid's three now. Yep, it's looking good.
[420.46s -> 423.46s]  Yeah, it's going to be good. I think cooldown buff is back up if you want to grab that.
[423.46s -> 427.14s]  Hades isn't really going to... Oh, wait, Ragney. Ragney is on your side.
[427.14s -> 433.46s]  I'll be fine. I'll dash through her. She must have pulled me out. Yeah, she missed. She missed her pull.
[433.46s -> 441.54s]  Silly girl. Get out of here. Oh, man, her basic attacks do so much damage.
[441.54s -> 447.84s]  I've got to get Voidblade. Voidblade is next, for sure.
[447.84s -> 457.85s]  I don't know if she wants it. I'm ulting as well. Yep, just hanging out, shooting autos.
[457.85s -> 467.46s]  Got one. Oh, she does so much damage. Oh, no. Oh, she webbed it.
[467.46s -> 476.81s]  Oh, damn, she's strong. Yeah. Son of a bitch. It's that dark, man.
[476.81s -> 483.38s]  What is she building? A little bit of life still. She hasn't got three yet, though.
[485.78s -> 488.78s]  She's probably in the jungle. I bet she's over here somewhere.
[488.78s -> 496.43s]  Yeah, I just hear her put eggs down. She's at Manor, actually. This is risky, isn't it?
[496.43s -> 500.43s]  Yeah, this is... Well, here she comes. Oh, she just got it.
[500.43s -> 509.20s]  Just get away from here. I'm going to... Oh, damn, I'm so dead. I'm so dead.
[509.20s -> 514.50s]  She's almost dead. My last hope. My last... No, boop. No, no, no.
[514.50s -> 521.72s]  She's one shot. Yep, she sure is. Hey, Ragney.
[521.72s -> 526.15s]  Oh, you got... Oh, stupid bugs. They're nearly dead. They're easy to kill.
[526.15s -> 529.15s]  Hades is coming your way, but he's really low. Yeah. Yeah, shoot him, shoot him.
[529.15s -> 531.33s]  I think you can kill him. You think I can get him? Yeah.
[531.33s -> 536.94s]  He can't do much damage to you. Yep. No. He's out of Manor as well.
[536.94s -> 541.89s]  Just shoot him. Oh, as I say... Oh, damn. He meditated.
[541.89s -> 545.89s]  Did he really use it? Yeah, at least he blew his meditation.
[545.89s -> 549.89s]  Yeah, I didn't know he was that low. I thought he was at at least more than half.
[549.89s -> 553.06s]  I don't know why he chased you. He's never going to out DPS here
[553.06s -> 557.43s]  if he's got no minions to smash, so I don't know what he was trying to do.
[557.43s -> 559.43s]  I thought he had way more health than that. Oh, well, that's good.
[559.43s -> 562.61s]  That's a good exchange. I'll take it. I'll take that, yeah.
[562.61s -> 569.94s]  I don't mind dying for the killing of the Arachne, at least, let alone the Hades two.
[569.94s -> 572.94s]  Left lane's still doing really solid 5-0 cupid. Oh, wow, yeah.
[572.94s -> 577.91s]  It's a long case 2-1. It's looking like a GG, but...
[577.91s -> 582.47s]  So, Paul's ultimate for people that are like, what the hell was that?
[582.47s -> 587.65s]  If you know Thor, Thor's ultimate is he goes in the air and you can pick a spot to jump down
[587.65s -> 588.65s]  and it stuns everybody, right?
[588.65s -> 592.95s]  Apollo's, you can just ride around in the air forever.
[592.95s -> 595.95s]  Well, not forever. It drains, what, 50 mana per second?
[595.95s -> 600.58s]  So, you can stay up in the air for as long as your mana can hold
[600.58s -> 602.58s]  and then you just land right on top of everybody.
[602.58s -> 605.88s]  It doesn't stun anyone, though. That's the thing, it does not stun anybody.
[605.88s -> 610.42s]  It just does like, I think it does a dot, right? If I'm not mistaken.
[610.42s -> 614.54s]  What, no? Apollo, his dot.
[614.54s -> 618.54s]  Yeah, his ultimate's kind of weird. It's like taking damage, his ultimate.
[618.54s -> 623.62s]  Oh, my God, every single person is in mid.
[623.62s -> 626.62s]  Yeah, that was really unlucky. I was about to smash everyone
[626.62s -> 629.62s]  and as I went to do it, Arachne silenced me. I couldn't.
[629.62s -> 633.21s]  Oh, they're not in mid anymore.
[633.21s -> 641.23s]  Yeah, they're building a Doom Orb.
[641.23s -> 643.23s]  So, he's got a lot of magic power. He hasn't died yet, either.
[643.23s -> 645.60s]  Arachne's up by Goldfury.
[645.60s -> 648.60s]  Is she gonna attack Goldfury? I'll jump on top of her if she is.
[648.60s -> 654.47s]  I think her, I don't know. I think her spider's hatched.
[654.47s -> 656.84s]  I think we have wards there, I think.
[656.84s -> 659.08s]  Yeah, I was gonna say. Oh, she's in lane.
[659.08s -> 661.58s]  I might. Oh, boy, never mind.
[661.58s -> 665.78s]  I was gonna say, I might be able to go jump on top of her right now.
[665.78s -> 669.71s]  I don't know. Maybe. Maybe we could.
[669.71s -> 673.85s]  Hades ult is done. Mine's up. Yep, let's do it.
[673.85s -> 676.47s]  Alright, I'm going in the air.
[676.47s -> 683.77s]  I thought she was gonna come backwards.
[683.77s -> 693.84s]  Oh, she exploded. She blew up.
[693.84s -> 698.43s]  Nice one. Yeah, I timed my ultimate.
[698.43s -> 701.43s]  I thought she was gonna go backwards. I never landed on nobody.
[701.43s -> 704.44s]  That's okay. At least we got them both.
[704.44s -> 707.44s]  Yeah, she was really far up with no mana.
[707.44s -> 709.44s]  And, like, not even have health.
[709.44s -> 712.05s]  I don't know what she was thinking.
[712.05s -> 714.05s]  We could grab mana. I think it might be up.
[714.05s -> 716.91s]  Maybe, maybe not. Let's check.
[716.91s -> 720.61s]  Nah, okay. No.
[720.61s -> 723.17s]  I don't think it'll be long.
[723.17s -> 725.17s]  I reckon she's talking about three minutes ago.
[725.17s -> 730.78s]  Let's just try to get the tower.
[730.78s -> 742.42s]  Right. Get that little doily. Little doily.
[742.42s -> 746.42s]  How are you doing? Oh, wow, you're 6 and 2. Nice.
[746.42s -> 749.11s]  Got a bunch of kills.
[749.11s -> 754.83s]  Put a bit of her in the tower, but fear that guy.
[754.83s -> 757.31s]  Fear me.
[757.31s -> 759.31s]  Let's just not get pulled by her.
[759.31s -> 762.00s]  Yeah, she's looking for a pull on me.
[762.00s -> 764.00s]  Nah, she got me, but it's okay.
[764.00s -> 766.00s]  Oh, shit, okay.
[766.00s -> 769.46s]  My bad.
[769.46s -> 775.41s]  Oh, boy, I'm going down here, for sure.
[775.41s -> 777.41s]  Oh, get out, boo.
[777.41s -> 779.41s]  She's just so much damage.
[779.41s -> 782.10s]  I don't think she actually went back to spawn.
[782.10s -> 785.23s]  I think she just life drained something.
[785.23s -> 787.23s]  But, yeah, let's not get pulled in.
[787.23s -> 791.14s]  Hades will have his ult now.
[791.14s -> 793.14s]  Arachne, I don't get her.
[793.14s -> 795.14s]  Loki, Loki, Loki.
[795.14s -> 797.38s]  Loki right here.
[797.38s -> 799.38s]  Oh, boy. Oh, my God.
[799.38s -> 804.29s]  Oh, boy.
[804.29s -> 807.68s]  Trying to get that hit on that Loki.
[807.68s -> 809.68s]  Oh, one more hit. Come on.
[809.68s -> 811.68s]  Oh, bitch, I'm going to die from the bleed.
[811.68s -> 813.68s]  No, you're not.
[813.68s -> 815.68s]  I feared her while she was hitting you.
[815.68s -> 817.68s]  That was very close.
[817.68s -> 819.68s]  I just get back to spawn before Hades
[819.68s -> 821.68s]  dashes out the jungle on you.
[821.68s -> 823.68s]  That was so close.
[823.68s -> 826.82s]  I'm lucky I had that last shot on
[826.82s -> 830.59s]  my one. My one's what killed her.
[830.59s -> 835.39s]  Yeah, well, lucky Hades was in there as well.
[835.39s -> 837.39s]  Loki kind of just, I don't know,
[837.39s -> 839.39s]  I thought he would have killed you, to be honest.
[839.39s -> 841.39s]  I know, so really, what does he build?
[841.39s -> 843.39s]  What does he get for items? Oh, he's only level 13, that's why.
[843.39s -> 845.39s]  He's just not, he's just been kind of
[845.39s -> 847.39s]  underleveled all game.
[847.39s -> 850.53s]  Left lane kind of sorted him out for us.
[850.53s -> 852.53s]  He definitely would have killed me.
[852.53s -> 854.53s]  If he was 15 or 16, oh, man,
[854.53s -> 856.53s]  I would have died in two hits.
[856.53s -> 858.83s]  I was just lucky.
[858.83s -> 860.83s]  I'm going to get physical protection for that Arachne.
[860.83s -> 862.83s]  I don't get Arachne. She's
[862.83s -> 864.83s]  super strong and scary.
[864.83s -> 866.83s]  I am terrified of her, but
[866.83s -> 870.03s]  she's considered one of the worst gods.
[870.03s -> 872.03s]  Yeah, that's very odd. Oh, right here, right here. Freya.
[872.03s -> 874.98s]  Freya's right here. Freya's literally right here.
[874.98s -> 877.92s]  She's on four. She's not too much of a threat.
[877.92s -> 880.99s]  She can still do big damage.
[880.99s -> 882.99s]  I might go in here and try to find her. She was just literally
[882.99s -> 885.68s]  right here. No, I'd say save it.
[885.68s -> 889.52s]  Save it for them. We all going to jump on this
[889.52s -> 891.52s]  Loki? Is that the plan? I think we're about to
[891.52s -> 893.52s]  show this Loki that he's in the wrong
[893.52s -> 896.70s]  lane. Alright, here we go.
[896.70s -> 898.70s]  You're in the wrong part of town, son.
[898.70s -> 901.39s]  Let's see if I can time this. I was going to say
[901.39s -> 903.39s]  he's right here. He's in the jungle.
[903.39s -> 909.01s]  Hello. I see Freya
[909.01s -> 911.01s]  as well. Oh, he's
[911.01s -> 913.01s]  over here. He's trying to... What, you don't think we can see
[913.01s -> 915.76s]  you over here?
[915.76s -> 917.76s]  Was he going to try and pull it through?
[917.76s -> 920.19s]  I don't know. That was weird. That was very odd.
[920.19s -> 922.56s]  This got gold. Arachne
[922.56s -> 925.38s]  probably just soloed that, to be honest.
[925.38s -> 928.90s]  As long as we... I got the tower.
[928.90s -> 931.52s]  I found a dragon.
[931.52s -> 936.37s]  Geez, you really did. Come on!
[937.37s -> 939.37s]  It was kind of unnecessary.
[939.37s -> 941.37s]  Alright, I'm going to get out of here. Oh, boy.
[941.37s -> 943.37s]  Arachne's right here. Arachne's right here. She's right here.
[943.37s -> 945.37s]  Yep, they're both right here.
[945.37s -> 947.37s]  Run.
[947.37s -> 949.67s]  Get out. Get out. Get out.
[949.67s -> 951.67s]  Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out.
[951.67s -> 953.67s]  Get out of here. Get out of here. See if a long guy leaves.
[953.67s -> 955.67s]  Retreat. I don't know. They might be able to get that.
[955.67s -> 957.67s]  Oh, no.
[957.67s -> 959.67s]  He's screwed. He's out of manners.
[959.67s -> 961.67s]  Oh, look at his health going down.
[961.67s -> 964.04s]  Yeah.
[964.04s -> 968.26s]  He's doing an attack buff. Oh, of course you got that.
[968.26s -> 971.77s]  Get him. Get him.
[971.77s -> 977.02s]  Oh, good dragon.
[977.02s -> 979.02s]  Right when he does his ult. Beautiful.
[979.02s -> 981.02s]  Oh, no.
[981.02s -> 986.71s]  She's not going to get away. Oh, no.
[986.71s -> 991.83s]  Freya.
[991.83s -> 993.83s]  No, I didn't. She's life stealing it.
[993.83s -> 997.29s]  One more hit.
[997.29s -> 999.91s]  One more hit.
[999.91s -> 1002.22s]  I missed so many auto attacks.
[1002.22s -> 1004.22s]  So many auto attacks were missed right there.
[1004.22s -> 1006.90s]  My goodness.
[1006.90s -> 1008.90s]  Thank god I could hit my one.
[1008.90s -> 1010.90s]  Seriously.
[1010.90s -> 1012.90s]  There was a Freya. She could ult you.
[1012.90s -> 1015.46s]  Oh, my god. You're right. Run. Run. Run. Run. Run.
[1015.46s -> 1017.46s]  That actually makes me run faster, doesn't it?
[1017.46s -> 1019.64s]  You dashed and the circle hit me.
[1019.64s -> 1021.64s]  So I move faster. It's cool.
[1021.64s -> 1023.64s]  Yeah.
[1023.64s -> 1025.64s]  It's a good buff.
[1025.64s -> 1029.67s]  I really need a void stone, but I can't afford one yet.
[1029.67s -> 1032.81s]  Let's go with some.
[1032.81s -> 1034.81s]  I want some crit and I want some spree.
[1034.81s -> 1038.20s]  And I want some more coffee.
[1038.20s -> 1042.20s]  I'm kind of glad the Arachne is doing well, otherwise this would just be a steam roll and the game would have been over a long time ago.
[1042.20s -> 1044.20s]  At least I'm making a game of it.
[1044.20s -> 1047.98s]  Because his left lane just stumped.
[1047.98s -> 1051.50s]  Are you building stacks or anything?
[1051.50s -> 1054.06s]  Nope.
[1054.06s -> 1056.06s]  I never do. I never do.
[1056.06s -> 1058.06s]  Well, Devara's Gloves is pretty amazing.
[1058.06s -> 1060.23s]  I don't buy it very often.
[1060.23s -> 1062.23s]  It's really cheap.
[1062.23s -> 1064.23s]  I only found out the other day.
[1064.23s -> 1066.23s]  The one thing I don't like about stack items is
[1066.23s -> 1068.23s]  you have to get the stacks.
[1068.23s -> 1070.23s]  I like the items that just give you the shit.
[1070.23s -> 1072.23s]  You get it.
[1072.23s -> 1074.98s]  Are you taking this?
[1074.98s -> 1076.98s]  You take it. I've already got max cooldown reduction.
[1076.98s -> 1080.06s]  Oh, let's go help.
[1080.06s -> 1083.11s]  I'm going up.
[1083.11s -> 1085.11s]  One of them's down. Loki's dead.
[1085.11s -> 1087.11s]  I'm going after Freya right now.
[1087.11s -> 1089.11s]  Oh, my prediction was wrong.
[1089.11s -> 1093.72s]  It's alright.
[1093.72s -> 1095.72s]  They're so dead.
[1095.72s -> 1098.02s]  Goodbye.
[1098.02s -> 1102.81s]  Nice.
[1102.81s -> 1104.81s]  Yeah, we can do Jhin.
[1104.81s -> 1107.18s]  There's Arachne.
[1107.18s -> 1109.18s]  In fact, if you get Jhin, I'll knock down midtown and make sure Arachne doesn't come.
[1109.18s -> 1111.86s]  Sounds like a plan.
[1111.86s -> 1115.18s]  Who's tanking this?
[1115.18s -> 1117.18s]  I actually think they're waiting for you.
[1117.18s -> 1120.12s]  No, they're not.
[1120.12s -> 1122.62s]  Arachne's missing now.
[1122.62s -> 1124.62s]  She's next to me, actually.
[1124.62s -> 1129.29s]  We should kill this before she gets here.
[1129.29s -> 1131.46s]  He's almost dead.
[1131.46s -> 1133.46s]  He is almost dead.
[1133.46s -> 1136.02s]  I'm going to need help with this Arachne.
[1136.02s -> 1144.20s]  That's the one.
[1144.20s -> 1146.20s]  Thank you very much.
[1146.20s -> 1148.20s]  I was just kind of dueling with it, like dancing while you were doing giant,
[1148.20s -> 1150.20s]  then you all just popped out on it.
[1150.20s -> 1153.72s]  There it is.
[1153.72s -> 1155.72s]  GG.
[1155.72s -> 1158.41s]  How'd you do?
[1158.41s -> 1160.41s]  Pretty good.
[1160.41s -> 1162.84s]  Probably wouldn't have had at least
[1162.84s -> 1164.84s]  three or four of those kills if not for your ultimate, but
[1164.84s -> 1167.59s]  that's how you do it, right?
[1167.59s -> 1169.96s]  Thanks for watching, guys.
[1169.96s -> 1171.96s]  That's Apollo, the god of music,
[1171.96s -> 1173.96s]  the sun, rain, the stars,
[1173.96s -> 1175.96s]  and every other thing in Greek and
[1175.96s -> 1177.96s]  Roman mythology. He's Greek, right?
[1177.96s -> 1179.96s]  Greek, yeah.
[1179.96s -> 1181.96s]  I think he's called Apollo in Greek and Roman.
[1181.96s -> 1184.14s]  I'm not sure.
[1184.14s -> 1186.14s]  Thanks for watching.
[1186.14s -> 1188.14s]  My pleasure.
[1188.14s -> 1190.14s]  And see you next time. Take care, everybody.
[1190.14s -> 1192.14s]  Goodbye, Smite!
