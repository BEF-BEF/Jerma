[0.31s -> 14.89s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with the Q&A video, the answers portion of the Q&A video.
[14.89s -> 19.89s]  And this is gonna be over some Smite gameplay. This is a 10-3 with the character Zeus.
[19.89s -> 25.89s]  If you don't know what Smite is, there's gonna be a link in the description to a Smite video that I made a long time ago.
[25.89s -> 32.06s]  But if you have no idea what's going on, you can watch that either before this video or after this video, during this video.
[32.06s -> 37.06s]  Whenever you watch that video, that is when you can kind of understand the basics of this game.
[37.06s -> 41.06s]  But I'm gonna let that sit in the background. We are gonna start talking about the questions now.
[41.06s -> 47.06s]  And the first one I'm gonna answer is something that I've been asked a lot and I haven't really addressed it in a long time.
[47.06s -> 53.06s]  And I'm going to right now. It is what do I do for work? What is my job? What do I do? How do I make money?
[53.06s -> 60.06s]  And that sort of question. So I'm gonna start off, first of all, this answer has changed over the last year and a half or so.
[60.06s -> 65.06s]  It started out as me doing freelance videography work. I did weddings. I did events.
[65.06s -> 69.06s]  Like, I was the guy that filmed your sister's wedding. Like, I was that guy.
[69.06s -> 74.24s]  But now, YouTube has kind of turned into a full-time gig for me.
[74.24s -> 80.24s]  Now, I need to really say this because there's a lot of misconceptions with the amount of money that people make on YouTube.
[80.24s -> 85.24s]  There are probably a lot of you guys that think I make a ton of money doing this and I'm just like swimming in money.
[85.24s -> 90.24s]  I've got like millions of... No, no, no, no, no. I don't make very much money at all from YouTube.
[90.24s -> 95.24s]  In fact, I would probably guess that most of you guys that have jobs probably make more money than I do.
[95.24s -> 101.24s]  But I'm not gonna get into that because I can't talk about money. It's against contract. It breaches all kinds of things.
[101.24s -> 106.24s]  So I don't want to get into any trouble. But I will say that YouTube has become a full-time thing for me.
[106.24s -> 112.24s]  And while I have another couple seconds here, another minute or so, I'm gonna blow the covers off of one more misconception
[112.24s -> 119.48s]  that a lot of people have with people that have a YouTube partnership or people that make ad revenue money off of YouTube.
[119.48s -> 125.48s]  If you like a video or favorite a video of somebody that has a partner channel, you're not making them any money.
[125.48s -> 128.48s]  That doesn't do anything like that for them. A lot of people think that.
[128.48s -> 132.48s]  A lot of people think that if they click the like button or favorite button on somebody with a partnership,
[132.48s -> 135.48s]  they're gonna give them more money. And that's just not the case.
[135.48s -> 138.48s]  What actually does happen when you like or favorite a video, if you don't know,
[138.48s -> 144.48s]  the reason why people want likes and people want favorites so much is because it spreads your content around.
[144.48s -> 150.48s]  It lets other people know that the channel exists, which is really, really important if you're trying to grow a channel, obviously.
[150.48s -> 153.48s]  You want more people to see it. The more people that see it, the more potential people will subscribe
[153.48s -> 155.48s]  and the more people will be around to watch your videos.
[155.48s -> 159.48s]  And you gotta remember, you guys have a lot of power on this website.
[159.48s -> 163.48s]  Never take for granted the power that you hold on YouTube.
[163.48s -> 166.48s]  People might try to make it seem like you're not that big of a deal,
[166.48s -> 173.48s]  but you are a huge deal. You are a massive deal to the success of every single channel on this website.
[173.48s -> 179.72s]  Every single one. If you watch YouTube videos, even the view, even if you hate a video,
[179.72s -> 182.72s]  even if you dislike a video or you like a video, whatever you're doing,
[182.72s -> 187.72s]  you're part of this collective community that keeps this website going strong.
[187.72s -> 191.72s]  I'm not gonna get into that anymore. I will probably talk about this on a completely different video,
[191.72s -> 194.72s]  but I want to move on now and get into another question, because it's been question one,
[194.72s -> 199.72s]  and it's been like three minutes. So we're gonna move on now. Yes, I do YouTube for work.
[199.72s -> 202.72s]  It's what I do to try to make myself stay alive.
[202.72s -> 207.22s]  So this next question is a very, very good one. I got this a lot as well.
[207.22s -> 211.22s]  It is, what is my opinion on Valve's Steam box?
[211.22s -> 215.22s]  Now, if you don't know, Valve is going to get into the hardware game here.
[215.22s -> 219.22s]  They're coming out with a console. I don't even think you can call this a console.
[219.22s -> 224.22s]  They're coming out with a condensed PC. It's gonna run on Linux. It's not gonna run on Windows.
[224.22s -> 229.22s]  And it's going to be something you hook up to your TV, kind of like a mini gaming PC, I guess you could call it.
[229.22s -> 235.22s]  I really don't know the details of this, but if you want my opinions on it, I think it's amazing.
[235.22s -> 239.22s]  I love Valve. I think Valve is an incredible company. I think this thing is going to be fantastic.
[239.22s -> 244.22s]  It's gonna make the people, because PC gaming has kind of this in-between period,
[244.22s -> 249.22s]  where if you don't have a lot of money, it's hard to get the most out of PC gaming.
[249.22s -> 256.39s]  If you can't spend, like, at least $500, $600, $700, you're not gonna get, like, a good gaming PC.
[256.39s -> 261.39s]  Now, some people might be able to throw a PC together for $325 and have it run.
[261.39s -> 264.39s]  Crisis at low settings or something like that.
[264.39s -> 272.39s]  But I'm talking about the real genuine PC gaming experience, where you have, like, a 24, 25, 27-inch monitor
[272.39s -> 276.39s]  running your game at a sick graphics card, 1080p, with all the settings up.
[276.39s -> 281.39s]  You really cannot hold a candle to that if you spend, like, $300 or $400 on a gaming PC,
[281.39s -> 285.39s]  but this SteamBox that's coming out could solve a lot of those problems.
[285.39s -> 290.39s]  It could make PC gaming completely viable to a bigger, broader mainstream market,
[290.39s -> 295.39s]  which is awesome because that means there's gonna be more development into PC gaming.
[295.39s -> 300.63s]  There's gonna be more eyeballs on PC gaming. We're not gonna be in that minority, really, anymore.
[300.63s -> 304.63s]  Well, I think, guys, it depends on how well the SteamBox does when it gets to retail.
[304.63s -> 307.63s]  If it ever does, it's still kind of in the development stage.
[307.63s -> 309.63s]  But it's gonna be really interesting to see where that goes.
[309.63s -> 312.63s]  I cannot wait to see all the crazy things that happen with that.
[312.63s -> 317.63s]  They're gonna take over. Valve is gonna take over the gaming market, and it's gonna be fantastic
[317.63s -> 321.63s]  because they are probably my favorite company, at least in gaming, of all time.
[321.63s -> 324.87s]  So we'll end on that. We're gonna move on to the next question.
[324.87s -> 331.18s]  The next question is by a guy named Erland. Erland D. Erland, maybe, but I'm not sure.
[331.18s -> 333.18s]  It's about Otto. I'm gonna go over a couple questions on Otto.
[333.18s -> 337.18s]  Otto is my little dog, if you don't know. And he does big adventures.
[337.18s -> 340.18s]  He has two big adventures, if you didn't know about those crazy movies.
[340.18s -> 342.18s]  But whatever, we're gonna get going here.
[342.18s -> 346.18s]  If, for some reason, I had to change Otto's name, what would I change it to?
[346.18s -> 350.67s]  That's pretty easy because my family was talking about this when we got the dog.
[350.67s -> 356.67s]  If it wasn't gonna be Otto, it was going to be Bandit, like a little bandit, or Pickles.
[356.67s -> 361.41s]  Little Pickles. I actually really like that name. Oh, look, it's Little Pickles.
[361.41s -> 365.41s]  But we stuck with Otto, and I like the name Otto because it's a very quick name.
[365.41s -> 367.41s]  It's a very short, two-syllable dog name.
[367.41s -> 371.41s]  I've met people before that have dogs with, like, a six-syllable name.
[371.41s -> 375.41s]  Oh, look, it's Mr. Wigglesonworth. How the hell do you call that dog?
[375.41s -> 378.41s]  Oh, come in, Mr. Wigglesonworth. Just call him Wigman.
[378.41s -> 380.65s]  Oh, like Wiggles or something. I don't know.
[380.65s -> 385.65s]  And follow-up to this, got this question a lot, too, is what breed is Otto?
[385.65s -> 388.65s]  Is he a dachshund? Is he a pincher, a mini-pincher?
[388.65s -> 392.89s]  What we think he is, and this is after research with his traits,
[392.89s -> 395.89s]  how he looks, how his body is, his body type, everything like that,
[395.89s -> 400.89s]  because with a rescue, because he is a rescue, it's hard to tell exactly what they are.
[400.89s -> 405.89s]  And those blood test DNA things that you can order from online or you send it into somewhere,
[405.89s -> 407.89s]  they're not always 100% accurate.
[407.89s -> 412.89s]  So what we think he is is a Chihuahua dachshund. We think he's a Chowinny.
[412.89s -> 415.89s]  He might have some beagle in him, maybe some pincher, we don't know,
[415.89s -> 419.89s]  but he has all the Chihuahua traits. He's got the curly, cute tail.
[419.89s -> 421.89s]  He's got the big head, big eyes.
[421.89s -> 425.89s]  And if you look up a Chowinny and you look at this dog face-to-face, back-to-back,
[425.89s -> 429.89s]  they look identical. So Chowinny, that's what we think he is.
[429.89s -> 434.58s]  So the next question is from A.E. Samuel, and he or she asks,
[434.58s -> 436.58s]  who is my favorite film director?
[436.58s -> 439.58s]  And they ask that because they're currently in film school.
[439.58s -> 442.58s]  They're learning communication and videography and stuff like that,
[442.58s -> 443.58s]  which is really cool. That's what I did.
[443.58s -> 445.58s]  So if you're doing that, cool, two thumbs up for you.
[445.58s -> 448.58s]  But my favorite film director is Christopher Nolan,
[448.58s -> 452.58s]  and most notably because not really the Batman movies,
[452.58s -> 455.58s]  but the stuff that he did before the Batman movies.
[455.58s -> 458.58s]  Don't get me wrong, I love the Batman movies.
[458.58s -> 460.58s]  The Dark Knight, Dark Knight Rises, Batman Begins.
[460.58s -> 462.82s]  They're fantastic films.
[462.82s -> 465.82s]  But before that, he made something specifically called Memento.
[465.82s -> 471.82s]  If you've never seen Memento, you go right now and Netflix the hell out of this movie right now.
[471.82s -> 472.82s]  Is it on Netflix? I hope it is.
[472.82s -> 476.82s]  Go watch it. It's one of the most mind freak movies I've ever seen in my life.
[476.82s -> 481.82s]  You have to watch it a couple of times, but it's the reason why I got into Christopher Nolan.
[481.82s -> 485.82s]  And another one of his movies that's really insane is Inception.
[485.82s -> 487.82s]  But we all know that. A lot of us have already seen Inception.
[487.82s -> 490.82s]  I still haven't even figured out what the hell is going on with that movie.
[490.82s -> 496.82s]  I've watched that movie three times now, and I think I get it, but I don't get it. Inception, baby.
[496.82s -> 500.63s]  But yeah, Christopher Nolan is my favorite film director.
[500.63s -> 502.63s]  So this next question was asked by a lot of people as well.
[502.63s -> 505.63s]  It is, where is Grandpa's face? Where's the face cam video?
[505.63s -> 507.63s]  Where is that freaking video?
[507.63s -> 511.63s]  And I already touched upon this in a video last week, but I'm going to touch upon it again.
[511.63s -> 515.63s]  Grandpa's face cam video is coming, but I want to make sure it's done right.
[515.63s -> 517.63s]  I want it to be a really, really big production movie.
[517.63s -> 521.63s]  I don't want it to be just a sloppy video where I throw it together and oh, there it is.
[521.63s -> 526.81s]  I'd rather do it the way that it should be done and the way that Grandpa would be proud of.
[526.81s -> 530.81s]  So it is coming. Don't worry. Just you're going to have to wait a little longer.
[530.81s -> 533.81s]  I don't know the exact time frame, but it is going to be soon.
[533.81s -> 535.81s]  I promise you that.
[535.81s -> 539.56s]  So the next question is, can you play an instrument?
[539.56s -> 542.74s]  And if so, can you do it on the video?
[542.74s -> 545.41s]  Well, let's see.
[545.41s -> 568.53s]  No, I cannot play a musical instrument, as you can see by that little clip there.
[568.53s -> 570.53s]  I've always wanted to though.
[570.53s -> 574.53s]  One of the instruments I've always wanted to play was either the guitar or the drums.
[574.53s -> 577.53s]  But I could never, it never really came to fruition.
[577.53s -> 578.53s]  I just am not that good at that.
[578.53s -> 584.53s]  I can't do the hand-eye coordination required to play the drums and my brain is like swish cheese.
[584.53s -> 589.53s]  So I can't like make my fingers go in the right spot when I'm playing the guitar.
[589.53s -> 593.53s]  I've tried both though, but both things, it just was not for me.
[593.53s -> 594.53s]  I could not do it.
[594.53s -> 597.70s]  But after trying a couple of times and trying to learn how to play an instrument,
[597.70s -> 602.70s]  I have such respect for people that can play instruments because knowing how difficult it is
[602.70s -> 605.70s]  and how much practice it requires, it's just my hat's off to you.
[605.70s -> 609.70s]  If you can play an instrument, hell yeah, that's awesome because I cannot do it.
[609.70s -> 615.46s]  So the final question for this particular Q&A is going to be from Chakra Cannon 97.
[615.46s -> 620.46s]  And they ask, would I ever discuss my political views or social issues
[620.46s -> 623.46s]  or things that are considered of higher importance?
[623.46s -> 626.70s]  And the real answer to this one, guys, is probably not.
[626.70s -> 632.70s]  I want to separate my social issue, my beliefs and my political beliefs away from this channel
[632.70s -> 636.06s]  because what you do when, let's just talk about politics for a second.
[636.06s -> 641.06s]  If I were to say I root for a certain political party, the other half, the other parties,
[641.06s -> 645.06s]  whether it's Republican, Democrat, Independent, whatever you consider yourself as,
[645.06s -> 649.06s]  at least in the United States, you're going to see me in a more negative light.
[649.06s -> 653.06s]  And I don't want to bring politics into a channel that's around fun
[653.06s -> 655.06s]  and just hanging out and having a good time.
[655.06s -> 659.06s]  I don't want to be like, well, you know, let's talk about abortion and gay rights.
[659.06s -> 662.06s]  And I really don't want to bring that into the discussion here.
[662.06s -> 665.06s]  I would rather keep it very neutral and just kind of have fun.
[665.06s -> 671.43s]  And that's the same reason why I don't do videos on news stories or drama in the community.
[671.43s -> 673.43s]  Like, I really just don't care.
[673.43s -> 679.43s]  I like to stay as far away from that as possible because this channel was never really designed that way.
[679.43s -> 683.43s]  It's always been about just gameplay, fun, funny moments, funny things.
[683.43s -> 688.43s]  It's never been the rant channel where I talk about like this asshole in the community.
[688.43s -> 690.43s]  No, it's never really been like that.
[690.43s -> 693.18s]  So I don't know why I would change it now.
[693.18s -> 695.18s]  But that is going to wrap up this Q&A, guys.
[695.18s -> 697.18s]  Thank you all so much for your questions.
[697.18s -> 702.18s]  The way I'm going to do future Q&A videos is ask another question in this video
[702.18s -> 705.18s]  down there in the comments section to prevent me from having to do another video
[705.18s -> 707.18s]  where I ask you to do questions.
[707.18s -> 709.18s]  We'll just kind of pile them on top of each other.
[709.18s -> 713.36s]  So each Q&A video I do just shlops you more questions down in the bottom there.
[713.36s -> 715.36s]  So thank you guys again for watching.
[715.36s -> 716.36s]  I really do appreciate it.
[716.36s -> 717.36s]  And I'll see you all next time.
[717.36s -> 719.36s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
