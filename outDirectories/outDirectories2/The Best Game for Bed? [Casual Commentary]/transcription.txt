[0.31s -> 13.51s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a gameplay commentary.
[13.51s -> 22.69s]  Tonight's episode of gameplay commentary is going to be what my favorite game to play in bed is.
[22.69s -> 26.99s]  Now you might be wondering, what do you mean your favorite game to play in bed? What are you talking about?
[26.99s -> 33.30s]  You have a PC, you've got like computers, you've got consoles. No, I'm talking about a game that you can pick up
[33.30s -> 40.30s]  and lie down on your bed and play for seemingly hours before you kind of drift off to sleep or to relax for a little bit.
[40.30s -> 45.30s]  I usually play this game to relax, although it doesn't have a whole lot of replayability.
[45.30s -> 51.30s]  And before anybody says anything, I need to say this very, very clearly, nobody paid me to make this video.
[51.30s -> 58.30s]  I didn't get paid money to make this. The guy that made this game, The Room, did not hand me a sack of hundreds
[58.30s -> 64.30s]  or like a sack of dirty sock full of fucking $20 bills. I like this game, so I'm making a video on it.
[64.30s -> 67.30s]  I did not get paid a single dollar. Please do not think that.
[67.30s -> 73.30s]  And if you say it, God help me, I'm going to be very mad at you and you're going to get in trouble with the Jerma police.
[73.30s -> 79.42s]  But anyways, now that that's out of my system, I play a lot of games in bed.
[79.42s -> 86.59s]  I play a lot of mobile games and I really should get myself something like a DS or a Vita,
[86.59s -> 91.59s]  because I spend so much time when I'm lying in my bed, just like sitting there chilling out and relaxing before I go to bed
[91.59s -> 96.59s]  or even when I'm in downtime during the day. I love just chilling out and playing the game.
[96.59s -> 99.77s]  And sometimes you just want something that'll do that.
[99.77s -> 104.77s]  You want a game where you want to program or something that you can just get in a different mindset,
[104.77s -> 111.77s]  take yourself away from the typical like shooters and like jumping.
[111.77s -> 115.44s]  Like sometimes you want to take yourself away from that.
[115.44s -> 123.68s]  And by far out of any game I've played on the App Store, at least, and this is Android, this is iTunes.
[123.68s -> 130.68s]  As long as it's iOS 5 and a recent device, you can't play this on like a 1997 iPod or something.
[130.68s -> 135.92s]  As long as you have a recent Apple product or a recent Android product, this will work on it.
[135.92s -> 140.22s]  It's called The Room. A lot of you guys have probably already heard of this game.
[140.22s -> 143.22s]  A lot of you guys probably saying, I played that game. It was pretty cool. It was pretty awesome.
[143.22s -> 148.40s]  I'm getting a frog in my throat. A lot of you guys probably played this game before.
[148.40s -> 152.88s]  I don't want to show a whole lot of the game.
[152.88s -> 157.88s]  I'm going to try to put some other stuff in the background probably because I don't want you guys to see all the puzzles
[157.88s -> 162.88s]  and all the boxes and all the openings and all the cool things that kind of happen during the time you play.
[162.88s -> 164.88s]  I don't want to give away any of the puzzle answers.
[164.88s -> 168.88s]  You can figure that out on your own or you can go find the answers if you really want to.
[168.88s -> 171.88s]  So I'm not sure what I'm going to be doing for the background of this video.
[172.88s -> 177.25s]  There might be like some random footage of me lifting weights.
[177.25s -> 182.42s]  I don't know. Something will be there during the course of this because I don't obviously want to give everything away.
[182.42s -> 188.66s]  But what this game is, it's a 3D adventure kind of point and click exploration game
[188.66s -> 194.84s]  where your whole goal is to open up this box that's just sitting on a table.
[194.84s -> 199.84s]  And it's not as easy as you think. It's not just like opening up, taking the crate and like prying it open with a crowbar
[199.84s -> 201.84s]  or just taking a key and opening and open up the box.
[201.84s -> 207.84s]  No, it's a series of crazy contraptions that you have to figure out.
[207.84s -> 210.84s]  And, oh, let me take a look at that. Let me put this device here.
[210.84s -> 220.78s]  And like it changes the box and it's one of the most satisfying gaming experiences for this type of genre that I've had in a while.
[220.78s -> 223.78s]  And there's a sequel to that recently came out last year.
[223.78s -> 226.08s]  This is not a new game.
[226.08s -> 233.08s]  And it saddens me that a couple of years ago I didn't find this when I was looking for cool games to play on the iPad or on my iPhone
[233.08s -> 235.08s]  just when I was in the doctor's office or something.
[235.08s -> 242.26s]  Now, the one problem with this game that you might have is, well, Jerma, you made a video pretty recently
[242.26s -> 249.26s]  about how shitty some of these companies are with their freemium, free to play, paywall type experiences.
[249.26s -> 253.26s]  That's not here. This game is one dollar and that's it.
[253.26s -> 256.26s]  There is no in-app purchases. There's no like super clues to buy.
[256.26s -> 260.26s]  Oh, I need to buy like a super clue to find out this, but no, it's all there.
[260.26s -> 264.26s]  Everything is there for you for one dollar.
[264.26s -> 271.26s]  As long as you are OK with having the experience be done and not really being able to go back and play it again.
[271.26s -> 276.26s]  That's the one thing of this game that you can't really do because you know all the puzzles.
[276.26s -> 282.26s]  And although it could be interesting to see how fast you can go through maybe like a speed run or something, but you can't really speed run it.
[282.26s -> 288.43s]  It's one of those games that you have to take your time and see all the animations and all the cool 3D models and stuff.
[288.43s -> 295.86s]  That's part of the game. And it is pretty short for the entire experience for both the room and the room 2.
[295.86s -> 303.47s]  You can probably do them both in less than 10 hours, but it's only going to cost you four bucks for everything anyways.
[303.47s -> 311.47s]  And it's one dollar for the original game and three dollars, two ninety nine for the room 2 as it stands right now.
[311.47s -> 315.47s]  These prices could change. They could drop. They could go up. I don't know.
[315.47s -> 319.47s]  That's what it is right now and recording of this video. So I'm just recommending it.
[319.47s -> 325.47s]  Just saying you guys, if you want to try it, go check it out. It's a really fun experience and go lie down in bed.
[325.47s -> 331.47s]  Go get yourself like a chocolate milk and go start the room and open up the boxes and see what's in there.
[331.47s -> 336.27s]  I think it could be a hat. No, it's not. It's not a hat inside the box.
[336.27s -> 338.27s]  All right. Well, that's going to wrap it up here, guys. Thank you so much for watching.
[338.27s -> 341.51s]  I really do appreciate it. And of course, take care, everybody.
