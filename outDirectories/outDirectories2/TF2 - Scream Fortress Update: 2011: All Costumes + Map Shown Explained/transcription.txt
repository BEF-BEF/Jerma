[0.76s -> 5.48s]  Okay, so here are the costumes for all the classes. Hopefully you guys enjoy this.
[5.48s -> 8.28s]  Some of these are hysterical. We're going to start with the Scout.
[8.28s -> 14.44s]  The Scout is the Cursor Nature. It's a set, three pieces, one hat, and two miscellaneous items.
[14.44s -> 18.20s]  You start with the Wrap Battler, which is kind of like a mummy hat over his eyes.
[18.76s -> 25.88s]  The Bunk, which is an arm wrap and a little ankh symbol for the necklace.
[25.88s -> 31.96s]  And the Futa, oh my god, how can I pronounce this? The Futan Kuman, or whatever you pronounce it.
[31.96s -> 35.08s]  So it's kind of like a mummy setup for the Scout. Looks pretty funny.
[35.08s -> 40.12s]  And he got a new melee weapon, the Unarmed Combat. Don't think it does anything.
[40.12s -> 43.00s]  It's just kind of a reskin of the bat, but it still looks pretty funny.
[43.00s -> 46.87s]  As you can see, it's some dude's arm.
[46.87s -> 52.15s]  All right, now let's move on to the Soldier. The Soldier got a, oh this is awesome. I love this so much.
[52.47s -> 59.11s]  This is the Tin Soldier, and the hat is the Idiot Box, which is kind of this robot head.
[59.11s -> 65.35s]  These really crappy steel pipes for his arms, and the shoestrings that's like little box shoes.
[65.35s -> 69.54s]  I think it looks hilarious. It's going to be so funny watching people running around with this.
[69.54s -> 75.14s]  Now the Pyro. The Pyro got this demon setup. This is really, really cool. I like this one a lot.
[75.14s -> 78.90s]  The Blazing Bull. It's called the Infernal Imp, is the name of the set.
[78.90s -> 85.11s]  The Blazing Bull for the head, Fallen Angel for the wings, and the second secondary is
[85.11s -> 91.85s]  Tail from the Crypt. He has a tail. So out of his little compression thing here. This is so funny.
[91.85s -> 96.73s]  All right, let's move on to the Demoman. The Demoman kind of got like a werewolf setup.
[96.73s -> 103.03s]  Look at this face. It's ridiculous. So it's called the Highland Hound, and the hat is the
[103.03s -> 108.23s]  Hair of the Dog. The first miscellaneous is the Scottish Snarl, which is kind of the face,
[108.87s -> 111.67s]  and look at the paws. These are great. The Pickled Paws.
[112.23s -> 116.92s]  Kind of see some werewolf Demoman running around. Pretty ridiculous.
[116.92s -> 122.44s]  Let's move on to the Heavy. The Heavies is kind of a let down, to be honest. I guess it's okay.
[122.44s -> 128.39s]  But it's a Frankenstein sort of remake, I guess. The name of the set is the Franken Heavy.
[128.39s -> 132.79s]  The can opener is the Head. The Steel-Tilled Stoppers is one of the miscellaneous,
[132.79s -> 137.51s]  and the second miscellaneous is the Soviet Stitch-Up. So it's kind of like a Frankenstein
[138.15s -> 142.95s]  monster kind of thing, with the brain coming out here in the end. It's cool, I guess. A little
[142.95s -> 149.02s]  kind of on the line. Like I said, I'm not really too happy about it, but whatever. It's cool.
[149.02s -> 156.14s]  This is the by far best one in the entire update. This is the Engineers. He got a Bug Fly update.
[156.14s -> 162.76s]  Oh god, this is so funny. The name of it is the Brundle Bundle. The Buzz Killer, which is this
[162.76s -> 169.30s]  Fly Face Mask thing, which is hysterical. Fly Wings as one miscellaneous, and the Fly Feet
[169.30s -> 174.02s]  as another one. I love this. I hope that they don't take this off. I hope they allow you to
[174.02s -> 178.87s]  keep this, because it can get... Oh, I can't believe it. It's so funny. The Medic is another
[178.87s -> 186.31s]  one of the really funny ones. Take a look at this. This is called the Mad Doctor, as I'm sure you
[186.31s -> 193.37s]  could assume. The Head is the Einstein, the Emerald Girardi, and the Dr. Google Stache is the other
[193.37s -> 200.82s]  miscellaneous. Very, very funny stuff. This is great. Let's move on now. The Sniper is also a
[200.82s -> 206.34s]  little bit on the somewhat lame side. The Hat is pretty cool. The Holy Hunter, the name of the
[206.34s -> 212.71s]  set is the Camper Van Helsing, and it's pretty funny. The Hat has got this little symbol up
[212.71s -> 217.99s]  here. It's a nice little... I like the hat. It's pretty cool looking. Garlic Flank Steak. It's the
[217.99s -> 222.07s]  miscellaneous. It's kind of hanging on the sides here, the garlic and the little knife. And Silver
[222.07s -> 227.14s]  Bullets up here. Kind of wish they did a little more with it, but it's still interesting. I still
[227.14s -> 232.09s]  think it's great. The Spy is also really interesting. Look at this. He looks like a Sand Raider.
[232.09s -> 236.98s]  The name of this one is the Invisible Rogue. So it's like the Invisible Man. I think it looks
[236.98s -> 244.10s]  like a Sand Raider. The Undercover is the Hat. The Intangible Ascot, whatever you say that,
[244.10s -> 249.96s]  is one of the miscellaneous. And the Goggles, the Griffin's Gog, are the second. So you can collect
[249.96s -> 255.16s]  these all from the new map that is updated. It is Ioduct. We're going to take a look at that right
[255.16s -> 259.24s]  now. And you get them in the cauldron when you first log on. You can get one of these in the
[259.24s -> 266.97s]  cauldron. So let's move on to the new map and the new monster. Okay, so here we are on Ioduct.
[266.97s -> 272.97s]  This is not Viaduct. It might look like Viaduct, but it's kind of a reskin of Viaduct. They took
[272.97s -> 279.69s]  Viaduct and made it haunted. Haunted Viaduct. And if you're wondering in the top part of the screen,
[279.69s -> 285.93s]  that is the new boss's health. The new boss is this thing right here, this giant floating eyeball.
[285.93s -> 290.57s]  The Monoculus, the Monoculus, whatever you want to say, however you want to pronounce it.
[290.57s -> 296.81s]  When he dies, he opens up a portal that you can go into, if my understanding is correct. And I think
[296.81s -> 301.85s]  the nearest few people, or maybe somebody that got the last hit on him, I'm not sure, but I end up
[301.85s -> 307.85s]  getting the last hit on him here, as you'll see. Not really sure. Gonna try and find that out later
[307.85s -> 312.09s]  on in the next couple of days, but you'll see what happens. He has almost no health. Also forgot to
[312.09s -> 317.69s]  mention, I want to say the new spy knife is just a reskin of the eternal reward. No biggie. Forgot
[317.69s -> 321.93s]  to mention that earlier. Wanted to bring that up. So there's the last hit right there. He just exploded.
[321.93s -> 327.62s]  Let's go into this new crazy world. Nobody wanted to shoot each other. I was kind of shooting this
[327.62s -> 331.46s]  guy, and then I was thinking, wait a minute. Maybe we should just see what's going on here. This little
[331.46s -> 337.22s]  gate runs down, and whoever picks it up, I think maybe everybody gets it. I'm not sure. I believe
[337.22s -> 342.42s]  maybe only one or two people can get it. Then once you get it, you turn into psycho mode, ubered and
[342.42s -> 346.50s]  critscreeged, and you can just kill everybody. This was just so confusing to me. I was like,
[346.50s -> 351.54s]  what is going on? But that is kind of the update, and then once I die, you will see the items that
[351.54s -> 356.50s]  I got for completing that. Two achievements, guys. You can get them, and one of the new items you can
[356.50s -> 362.34s]  get is this thing right here, the bombonomicon. That's a new mask. The monoculus is a new mask,
[362.34s -> 366.82s]  and this thing explodes spontaneously on death. Not really sure what that does,
[366.82s -> 371.30s]  but maybe it kills people that you blow up near. Thank you all so much for watching. I really
[371.30s -> 375.62s]  appreciate it. Go have fun with this new update. There's a couple of things I didn't get to cover,
[375.62s -> 380.10s]  but I tried to get most of it in one video. Thank you guys so much. I'll see you all next time,
[380.10s -> 381.54s]  and take care, everybody.
