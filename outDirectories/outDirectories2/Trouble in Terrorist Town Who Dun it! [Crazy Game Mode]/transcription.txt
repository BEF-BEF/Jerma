[0.31s -> 17.44s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some trouble in Terrorist Town, the mod for Garry's Mod and Counter-Strike Source.
[17.44s -> 24.44s]  Just wanted to briefly introduce this before the live stuff kicks in, because it can be very confusing if you're just watching this and have no idea what's going on.
[24.44s -> 28.44s]  So I will try to clarify this a little bit before we get started.
[29.44s -> 35.62s]  So essentially, it's kind of in the same category as Jailbreak, where it's just this enormous social experiment.
[35.62s -> 38.62s]  And I love stuff like this. It's one of the reasons I love Jailbreak so much.
[38.62s -> 44.62s]  And you're gonna see a lot more Jailbreak. You'll probably see a lot of this as well, this TTT. I think that's what people call it.
[44.62s -> 49.62s]  But so this is how it breaks down, right? You got three different people, three different types of people in this game.
[49.62s -> 52.62s]  You have innocents, traitors, and detectives.
[52.62s -> 55.62s]  So what you do, the whole point of the game, is to just stay alive.
[55.62s -> 62.62s]  If you're an innocent like I am in this game, the whole goal is to just not die and to try and get rid of all the traitors.
[62.62s -> 68.62s]  The traitors, their goal is to try and kill everybody without being seen and without being found out.
[68.62s -> 76.62s]  And the detectives, they are the exact same things as innocents, except they have a couple of things at their arsenal to try and track down the traitors.
[76.62s -> 79.62s]  They have something, they have a DNA scanner and stuff like that.
[79.62s -> 84.62s]  So it's cool to be either one of these things, because it really is just a giant show.
[84.62s -> 94.86s]  It's just a giant acting lesson. If you're a traitor, or even if you're an innocent, you have to try to find ways to convince your fellow man to not kill you.
[94.86s -> 99.86s]  So again, you have to have Counter-Strike Source and Garry's Mod to be able to play this game.
[99.86s -> 105.86s]  If you have these two, go check it out. And here comes a live session right here of just absolute nonsense.
[105.86s -> 109.86s]  So I'll see you guys all next time. Enjoy the live commentary and take care, everybody.
[115.74s -> 117.74s]  I'm with ass face and abusive.
[118.74s -> 120.74s]  I'm with ass face and abusive.
[120.74s -> 122.74s]  Okay, who's on the other side of that door?
[122.74s -> 124.74s]  Dude, you can trust me, you can trust me.
[124.74s -> 126.74s]  It's one of the detectives.
[134.91s -> 136.91s]  Who just shot the detective?
[136.91s -> 138.91s]  I don't know.
[138.91s -> 140.91s]  This is the scariest thing ever.
[142.91s -> 144.91s]  Get him, get him, kill him.
[145.91s -> 147.91s]  Kill Broby.
[147.91s -> 149.91s]  There's a chair out of the way.
[149.91s -> 151.91s]  Seriously, there's a chair out of the way.
[151.91s -> 153.91s]  Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot.
[153.91s -> 155.91s]  Get the chair out of the way.
[155.91s -> 158.41s]  Get the chair out of the way.
[158.41s -> 160.41s]  Broby killed the detective.
[160.41s -> 162.41s]  Cover me, I'm going to do some DNA scanning.
[162.41s -> 164.41s]  Was Broby a terrorist?
[164.41s -> 170.41s]  Yeah, Broby was a traitor, and she killed Rainbow Kitten, who was a detective.
[170.41s -> 172.41s]  Me and Jeremiah opened the door.
[173.41s -> 175.41s]  That's a DNA scanner.
[178.41s -> 181.41s]  I have DNA on you, too, if you did anything here.
[181.41s -> 183.41s]  Yeah, I killed the detective.
[183.41s -> 185.41s]  No, I mean the traitor.
[185.41s -> 187.41s]  I killed the detective.
[187.41s -> 189.41s]  No, I didn't do that.
[189.41s -> 191.41s]  I'm with abusive.
[191.41s -> 193.41s]  This Renegade, why is he badly wounded?
[193.41s -> 195.41s]  I'm with abusive in German.
[195.41s -> 197.41s]  They're locking me in.
[199.41s -> 202.03s]  I picked up a DNA scanner.
[202.03s -> 204.03s]  Renegade, Renegade, why are you badly wounded?
[204.03s -> 206.03s]  Where have you been?
[206.03s -> 208.34s]  Alright.
[210.34s -> 212.34s]  Alright, Jerma, try to pick up this AWP right here.
[212.34s -> 214.34s]  Drop your primary.
[214.34s -> 216.34s]  This doesn't work, this doesn't work.
[216.34s -> 218.34s]  Traders don't get it.
[218.34s -> 220.34s]  Really?
[220.34s -> 222.34s]  Yeah, this doesn't work.
[222.34s -> 224.34s]  Are you sure this doesn't work?
[224.34s -> 226.70s]  What the hell is going on?
[226.70s -> 228.70s]  Oh my god, that's morbid.
[228.70s -> 230.70s]  I think there's someone missing.
[230.70s -> 232.70s]  Renne, why are you hurt?
[232.70s -> 234.70s]  I already asked him.
[236.70s -> 238.70s]  What?
[238.70s -> 240.70s]  I'm alone with Renegade.
[240.70s -> 242.70s]  You're not alone with anyone.
[242.70s -> 244.70s]  We're all here together.
[248.70s -> 250.70s]  I'm downstairs with Renegade.
[250.70s -> 252.70s]  We're in the bank.
[252.70s -> 254.70s]  He's trying to get away from me.
[254.70s -> 257.20s]  He's got his pistol out.
[257.20s -> 259.20s]  Jerma, you're alone with abusive now.
[259.20s -> 261.20s]  I'm alone with abusive right now.
[263.20s -> 267.10s]  We're being followed by abusive.
[267.10s -> 270.88s]  The man he's carrying.
[270.88s -> 272.88s]  I'm so fucked.
[272.88s -> 274.88s]  There has to be a traitor here.
[274.88s -> 276.88s]  I'm going to say that.
[276.88s -> 278.88s]  I think it's Jerma and it's not me.
[278.88s -> 280.88s]  Me too.
[283.18s -> 285.18s]  Nope, he's innocent.
[285.18s -> 287.18s]  Damn it.
[287.18s -> 289.18s]  Wait a minute.
[289.18s -> 291.18s]  Alright, well.
[291.18s -> 293.18s]  What the fuck?
[293.18s -> 295.18s]  Where are you guys?
[295.18s -> 299.18s]  He was carrying around that body like a real creep.
[299.18s -> 301.68s]  Come on.
[301.68s -> 303.68s]  Like it was a prize.
[305.68s -> 309.68s]  I do not think that Jerma is the terrorist.
[309.68s -> 313.68s]  He wouldn't have reacted that way to a detective dying.
[313.68s -> 315.68s]  Believe it's stealth.
[315.68s -> 317.68s]  No, that's only when you're dead.
[317.68s -> 321.68s]  You can only see that when you're dead.
[321.68s -> 325.68s]  It's a real case of who done it.
[325.68s -> 327.68s]  Second floor.
[327.68s -> 329.68s]  You guys go.
[329.68s -> 331.68s]  Body here.
[331.68s -> 333.68s]  Is there anybody in here?
[333.68s -> 335.68s]  No.
[335.68s -> 337.68s]  They're not here.
[337.68s -> 339.68s]  We have to go downstairs in the elevator.
[339.68s -> 341.68s]  Let's get in the elevator.
[341.68s -> 343.68s]  We're going into the elevator.
[343.68s -> 345.68s]  I don't know where we're at right now.
[345.68s -> 347.68s]  You want us to get in the elevator so bad.
[347.68s -> 349.68s]  Good place to drop some C4.
[349.68s -> 351.68s]  Come with us.
[351.68s -> 353.68s]  I would instant die if I did that.
[355.68s -> 357.68s]  I wouldn't even be able to arm the C4 before you guys kill me.
[361.68s -> 363.68s]  What the hell is this?
[363.68s -> 365.68s]  Let's get in the very confined elevator.
[365.68s -> 367.68s]  I believe that the map is bigger than we think.
[367.68s -> 369.68s]  If I die, she's dead.
[371.68s -> 373.68s]  Don't leave yet Renegade.
[373.68s -> 375.68s]  Renegade, don't you dare press that button.
[375.68s -> 377.68s]  I'm shooting you.
[377.68s -> 379.68s]  We're going to wait for the others.
[379.68s -> 381.68s]  No, I lost you guys.
[381.68s -> 383.68s]  I don't know where you guys went.
[383.68s -> 385.68s]  We went back downstairs.
[385.68s -> 388.43s]  Don't you dare press that button Renegade.
[390.43s -> 392.43s]  Hulster your guns.
[394.43s -> 396.43s]  Hulster a gun.
[396.43s -> 398.43s]  We're all dead if we do that.
[400.43s -> 402.43s]  I did it.
[402.43s -> 404.43s]  It's alright.
[404.43s -> 406.43s]  Crowbar doesn't do any damage anyways.
[410.43s -> 412.43s]  What if this door opens
[412.43s -> 414.43s]  and people have guns in the other side?
[420.43s -> 422.43s]  What was that?
[422.43s -> 424.43s]  It was him.
[424.43s -> 426.43s]  It was Renegade.
[426.43s -> 428.43s]  Renegade.
[428.43s -> 430.43s]  It was Renegade.
[430.43s -> 432.43s]  It was Renegade.
[432.43s -> 434.43s]  The second the elevator doors opened
[434.43s -> 436.43s]  he shot Tio in the face and just ran.
