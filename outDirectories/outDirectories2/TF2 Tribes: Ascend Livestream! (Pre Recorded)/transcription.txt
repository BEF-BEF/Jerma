[190.59s -> 203.95s]  will be up on YouTube. This whole thing.
[203.95s -> 208.18s]  Again, because I didn't check that.
[208.18s -> 210.67s]  Where from Massachusetts am I from?
[210.67s -> 214.38s]  I am from Boston. I guess I'm not
[214.38s -> 216.38s]  really from Boston. I'm kind of
[216.38s -> 218.38s]  from a suburb of Boston, but
[218.38s -> 220.38s]  I'm close enough where I can say I'm from Boston, I guess.
[220.38s -> 225.44s]  Let's get a zero out of
[225.44s -> 228.94s]  chart 24.
[228.94s -> 234.83s]  Any zero out of 32? There it is.
[234.83s -> 241.28s]  Alright, how about this one?
[241.28s -> 247.87s]  Here's the IP. I know what Redding is.
[247.87s -> 252.14s]  I have family members in Redding.
[252.14s -> 256.29s]  That's pretty cool. Alright, the
[256.29s -> 261.98s]  IP is going in the chat right now.
[261.98s -> 264.80s]  Make sure I get in there first. There you go.
[264.80s -> 277.14s]  What's going on, guys?
[277.14s -> 279.14s]  Bad water basin. Let's fill this server up, huh?
[279.14s -> 294.74s]  Come on, let's go.
[294.74s -> 298.19s]  I don't got all day.
[298.19s -> 300.74s]  Who am I kidding? I got plenty of time.
[300.74s -> 303.62s]  I got all the time in the world.
[303.62s -> 308.48s]  That's not really that true.
[308.48s -> 313.54s]  Zero to zero. Where is everybody?
[313.54s -> 318.72s]  I'm the only person. Did I give the right server?
[318.72s -> 321.60s]  I think I did, didn't I? Hope I did.
[321.60s -> 327.22s]  I hope I gave the right server.
[327.22s -> 333.86s]  Let me make sure I did.
[333.86s -> 338.26s]  This is the one, right? Yeah, okay.
[338.26s -> 341.84s]  Copy. Yeah, I'm going to put it in there again
[341.84s -> 354.30s]  just in case. Just in case.
[354.30s -> 356.30s]  Alright, it looks like that was the right server.
[356.30s -> 364.10s]  I hope so.
[364.10s -> 374.64s]  Like you won't fight off.
[374.64s -> 376.64s]  I like your hat, Nimby. You get a cool hat.
[376.64s -> 381.44s]  First time in my stream because you are
[381.44s -> 383.44s]  six hours ahead. It is late for you.
[383.44s -> 389.70s]  You are a late dweller.
[389.70s -> 391.70s]  That guy's lagging. I don't want to kill him.
[391.70s -> 395.47s]  I feel bad. That guy was slow motion.
[399.17s -> 406.32s]  Got my lemonade over here on the left.
[406.32s -> 408.32s]  It has been really nice out.
[408.32s -> 410.32s]  I don't know what it's been like for you guys
[410.32s -> 412.75s]  wherever you live, but
[412.75s -> 414.75s]  my goodness, it has been so beautiful out here lately.
[414.75s -> 416.75s]  It's been 75 degrees,
[416.75s -> 419.18s]  80 degrees every single day.
[419.18s -> 421.18s]  And I've been going outside a lot.
[421.18s -> 423.55s]  I've been taking my new dog for walks.
[423.55s -> 426.11s]  You know that deal. Oh, I actually killed him.
[426.11s -> 429.82s]  Oh, that's a spy.
[429.82s -> 431.82s]  Oh, nice shot, dude. Nice shooting, Tex.
[431.82s -> 447.36s]  Funny spots.
[447.36s -> 449.60s]  Alright, what have we got here?
[449.60s -> 453.06s]  Ooh, good dodging.
[453.06s -> 456.70s]  Jump into it.
[456.70s -> 460.74s]  Damn. How long did the stream go? I just started.
[460.74s -> 462.98s]  I literally just started like
[462.98s -> 471.87s]  five minutes ago. Oh, boy, that's death.
[471.87s -> 478.66s]  Oh, come on. Pyro versus Pyro.
[478.66s -> 486.06s]  Oh, I didn't kill him.
[486.06s -> 490.22s]  Oh, I thought he was going to go to the...
[490.22s -> 493.36s]  I'm going to die. He knows how much health I have.
[493.36s -> 501.15s]  Oh, run away. Dead.
[501.15s -> 503.15s]  Aquafire 102. What's up, dude?
[503.15s -> 506.99s]  No demo, man. I'll change the setup.
[506.99s -> 509.30s]  Oh, by the way, if anybody has noticed,
[509.30s -> 511.30s]  I'm not sure if you've noticed. Oh, God, there's that spray again.
[511.30s -> 513.73s]  But, my...
[513.73s -> 516.22s]  I changed my FOV. I made it bigger.
[516.22s -> 518.22s]  I'll show you what I did.
[518.22s -> 520.22s]  I didn't make it too huge, but
[520.22s -> 522.85s]  here's my FOV now.
[522.85s -> 525.41s]  I changed it to like 30% more,
[525.41s -> 527.58s]  and I made my
[527.58s -> 529.95s]  weapon view model like 30% more.
[529.95s -> 531.95s]  So, if you've noticed that, I know a lot of people were saying,
[531.95s -> 533.95s]  please change that.
[533.95s -> 536.83s]  So, I did.
[536.83s -> 539.14s]  And it actually is a little bit better.
[539.14s -> 547.58s]  Easier to see things.
[547.58s -> 552.64s]  I got a healer now. Alright. That guy's got a buff of Vienna.
[552.64s -> 557.62s]  Oh, I didn't kill him. He walked right over it, too.
[557.62s -> 560.05s]  What? Where did he come from?
[560.05s -> 562.74s]  Where did he even come from?
[562.74s -> 564.98s]  Was he the medic? No, the medic was healing me.
[564.98s -> 568.75s]  Like, that medic behind me was healing me.
[568.75s -> 571.44s]  He just came out of legit nowhere.
[571.44s -> 573.44s]  Dear Engi, I sapped your sentries. See you again soon,
[573.44s -> 576.00s]  lol, spy.
[576.00s -> 578.88s]  Spray over.
[578.88s -> 580.88s]  That's a nice spray, though. What? That's how he gets in here.
[580.88s -> 583.87s]  He's still alive.
[583.87s -> 589.30s]  Don't let him get me. Don't let him get me.
[589.30s -> 592.18s]  Oh, he's got nowhere to go now. How did he get that?
[592.18s -> 594.74s]  He's gonna get me.
[594.74s -> 597.17s]  He's doing a side stab.
[597.17s -> 599.47s]  He's gonna move. Yeah.
[599.47s -> 603.50s]  There we go. Dear Engi, I sapped your sentries.
[603.50s -> 605.81s]  Oh, and I'll move that.
[605.81s -> 607.81s]  That's mean.
[607.81s -> 611.26s]  We're getting rolled right now.
[611.26s -> 613.26s]  Oh my god, I haven't done anything.
[613.26s -> 621.78s]  Why do I only have like one kill?
[621.78s -> 627.86s]  Oh, you're making me waste my stuff, scout.
[627.86s -> 635.78s]  Oh, come on. How did I not hit him?
[635.78s -> 641.34s]  Let's get him out of here.
[641.34s -> 643.34s]  He's not dead. He is not dead. He is definitely still alive.
[643.34s -> 650.19s]  Alright, let's go for a super spam shot here, dude.
[650.19s -> 653.31s]  Come on, walk over that.
[653.31s -> 657.78s]  Oh my god.
[657.78s -> 660.66s]  Chaos.
[660.66s -> 663.73s]  What do I have crits for?
[663.73s -> 666.99s]  What a waste.
[666.99s -> 669.17s]  Let me get the medic at least.
[669.17s -> 671.17s]  Thank goodness. If I didn't kill that medic, I would have been so upset with myself.
[671.17s -> 680.94s]  Do I like Twitch or do I like YouTube better?
[680.94s -> 685.87s]  I mean, YouTube has a lot of problems right now.
[685.87s -> 687.87s]  There's a lot of glitches with YouTube.
[687.87s -> 690.37s]  There's a lot of bugs and stuff.
[690.37s -> 692.61s]  And it's in beta. I can understand that.
[692.61s -> 697.42s]  But I would definitely say the process is much easier on Twitch.
[697.42s -> 700.82s]  That's what I will just say at least.
[700.82s -> 702.82s]  The YouTube stream is better quality though.
[702.82s -> 704.82s]  Because I'm partnered on YouTube and I'm partnered through Machinima.
[704.82s -> 706.82s]  So the YouTube stream will look better.
[706.82s -> 710.06s]  But, I don't know.
[710.06s -> 712.06s]  Hopefully they fix up some of their bugs.
[712.06s -> 720.94s]  I'm confident they will.
[720.94s -> 730.66s]  Whoa. Somebody walked through there.
[730.66s -> 733.47s]  Medic!
[733.47s -> 739.09s]  Yeah, I'll go combat engine next.
[739.09s -> 741.90s]  Look at all these people. My goodness.
[741.90s -> 745.94s]  Oh, don't get yourself killed.
[745.94s -> 752.72s]  Oh man.
[752.72s -> 755.79s]  Oh, come on. Kill somebody.
[755.79s -> 760.13s]  Oh, I got the medic. Good.
[760.13s -> 763.12s]  Oh, keep coming. Oh no!
[763.12s -> 766.06s]  Come on, give me the health.
[766.06s -> 768.94s]  What? Uber! What? Escape! Escape!
[768.94s -> 774.75s]  Damn.
[774.75s -> 781.47s]  Thought I was going to escape. But I didn't.
[781.47s -> 785.57s]  Boom. Yeah, after this round I'm going to go combat engine.
[785.57s -> 788.13s]  Oh, there's a crit dude right there.
[788.13s -> 794.26s]  Oh no, give me away.
[794.26s -> 796.26s]  Where's the spy? Oh, he's up top there.
[796.26s -> 799.63s]  He's going up this way. Get him!
[799.63s -> 802.32s]  Why am I stuck on the staircase?
[802.32s -> 804.99s]  Is that another spy?
[804.99s -> 808.19s]  Yeah, there he is.
[808.19s -> 810.19s]  Everyone's running frantically around chasing this spy.
[810.19s -> 812.19s]  Oh, I'll walk over that, please.
[812.19s -> 814.19s]  Somebody go to the left side.
[814.19s -> 817.82s]  Come on. Dare you.
[817.82s -> 821.22s]  I double dog dare you.
[821.22s -> 825.38s]  Anybody up there? I'll leave that there.
[825.38s -> 831.82s]  That can be the defense spam.
[831.82s -> 834.06s]  Oh god. Anybody in the car?
[834.06s -> 840.19s]  No, not yet. Get away from me.
[840.19s -> 842.43s]  Yeah, come on. Get on the car now.
[842.43s -> 847.74s]  Come step on that car. You know you want to.
[847.74s -> 850.50s]  Somebody get on that car. I want to blow it up.
[850.50s -> 858.93s]  I need to get healed.
[858.93s -> 860.93s]  Wait, is there a spy up at spawn?
[860.93s -> 863.49s]  I might have to go deal with that. Hold on.
[863.49s -> 866.37s]  Oh, I just launched myself into nowhere.
[866.37s -> 868.80s]  What? What is going on?
[868.80s -> 871.22s]  Why? Why are they bouncing?
[871.22s -> 875.25s]  Where's the spy?
[875.25s -> 882.27s]  He's freaking me out. Was that a sniper?
[882.27s -> 887.31s]  No. Yikes.
[887.31s -> 890.32s]  The IP, I linked it a while ago.
[890.32s -> 892.94s]  I'm going to be changing servers after this anyways.
[892.94s -> 894.94s]  Get more people into the game.
[894.94s -> 899.30s]  There's a lot of people in this room.
[899.30s -> 903.58s]  There's definitely a lot of people still in here.
[903.58s -> 906.85s]  Oh, crits. Oh, I didn't get anybody.
[906.85s -> 915.87s]  Come on, damn.
[915.87s -> 918.62s]  A soldier? Hold on. I've got to deal with this.
[918.62s -> 921.70s]  Oh!
[921.70s -> 924.26s]  That's a spy.
[924.26s -> 927.39s]  That's definitely a spy. No way. Maybe not.
[927.39s -> 930.83s]  No, it's not a spy.
[930.83s -> 937.42s]  Oh my god.
[937.42s -> 939.86s]  I was not ready for this, but I'm going to do it anyways. Let's do it.
[939.86s -> 941.86s]  Oh, come on. There may be something over here.
[941.86s -> 948.06s]  I can blow people up. Come on. Die, you bastard.
[955.28s -> 960.72s]  Jerma is a wizard. Official.
[960.72s -> 967.62s]  Let's go. Woohoo.
[967.62s -> 971.07s]  Oh, man. Look at all those people.
[971.07s -> 974.14s]  How am I doing?
[974.14s -> 978.05s]  Not that bad.
[978.05s -> 980.61s]  No 720 here.
[980.61s -> 987.26s]  I'm not partnered on Twitch.
[987.26s -> 989.26s]  It's over. I owe gaming.
[989.26s -> 996.24s]  Register today.
[996.24s -> 1004.42s]  I killed myself. Damn.
[1004.42s -> 1006.42s]  I want to start live streaming soon.
[1006.42s -> 1009.42s]  Any advice on how to get started? Oh, yeah.
[1009.42s -> 1011.42s]  Most important thing is your internet needs to be able to handle it.
[1011.42s -> 1013.98s]  That's, I'd say, the number one thing.
[1013.98s -> 1015.98s]  Go to speedtest.net
[1015.98s -> 1018.16s]  and run a speed test.
[1018.16s -> 1020.16s]  I'd say if you upload speed,
[1020.16s -> 1022.40s]  if your upload speed is less than one,
[1022.40s -> 1024.40s]  like 1.0,
[1024.40s -> 1026.40s]  one megabit per second up,
[1026.40s -> 1028.77s]  I'd say it might be difficult for you to stream
[1028.77s -> 1030.77s]  in good quality.
[1030.77s -> 1033.01s]  But if you're higher than one or two
[1033.01s -> 1035.18s]  megs up,
[1035.18s -> 1038.51s]  you should be fine to stream.
[1038.51s -> 1040.51s]  I mean, you guys have been here before when I've had problems
[1040.51s -> 1042.51s]  streaming. I mean, I have 10 up connection.
[1042.51s -> 1045.70s]  Oh my god.
[1045.70s -> 1051.95s]  Somebody run over that. There we go.
[1051.95s -> 1053.95s]  Yes. Yes, yes, yes. That's what I wanted.
[1053.95s -> 1058.05s]  Run. But you guys have been to streams before
[1058.05s -> 1060.05s]  where it's been unwatchable from lag.
[1060.05s -> 1062.05s]  And I have a 10 up connection.
[1062.05s -> 1064.61s]  It's just weird.
[1064.61s -> 1072.42s]  The internet is a weird place.
[1072.42s -> 1074.42s]  And also I'd also say you need a pretty good processor
[1074.42s -> 1076.59s]  and video card because essentially your computer's
[1076.59s -> 1078.96s]  doing kind of like double work.
[1078.96s -> 1089.55s]  Oh, no, I got crit rocket.
[1089.55s -> 1093.58s]  Oh, I got two cats, man. I love cats.
[1093.58s -> 1096.34s]  I love any animal.
[1096.34s -> 1098.34s]  The only animal that I could probably say I don't like
[1098.34s -> 1101.84s]  is, I don't know,
[1101.84s -> 1104.46s]  maybe like, this is a hard
[1104.46s -> 1107.02s]  question. The only animal that I don't think
[1107.02s -> 1109.02s]  I would like to... Oh my god, another Uber.
[1109.02s -> 1111.02s]  This is ridiculous. I'd like
[1111.02s -> 1113.52s]  the Uber machine tonight.
[1113.52s -> 1117.23s]  Oh,
[1117.23s -> 1121.90s]  that was crazy.
[1121.90s -> 1124.14s]  Anyways, probably an animal
[1124.14s -> 1126.14s]  big enough that will like literally kill me
[1126.14s -> 1129.15s]  if I go near it. So
[1129.15s -> 1134.72s]  probably something like that. Oh, yeah, four up
[1134.72s -> 1137.47s]  is fine. You'll be fine with four up.
[1137.47s -> 1148.13s]  Here we go. Oh, boy.
[1148.13s -> 1150.13s]  God, I feel like the other team's
[1150.13s -> 1153.01s]  getting neglected. Spread the Ubers around.
[1153.01s -> 1155.44s]  I don't need them all. No, I'm just kidding.
[1155.44s -> 1159.46s]  We're going up top here. Or I could
[1159.46s -> 1161.46s]  just apparently not detonate the
[1161.46s -> 1164.78s]  mine. What's going on here? What's going on
[1164.78s -> 1167.52s]  here? So many people. So
[1167.52s -> 1173.79s]  many people to spam. This is
[1173.79s -> 1177.95s]  chaos. Oh, this is absolute chaos.
[1177.95s -> 1184.16s]  Oh my god. This is
[1184.16s -> 1186.16s]  ridiculous. 32 player servers
[1186.16s -> 1192.69s]  are insanity. Yeah, this...
[1192.69s -> 1195.06s]  Oh my god. Yeah, there's a
[1195.06s -> 1197.06s]  full group in here, man.
[1197.06s -> 1200.26s]  Yeah, right after this round ends, I'm
[1200.26s -> 1203.14s]  gonna hop on a new server. Oh,
[1203.14s -> 1210.18s]  fly. Oh, that's a double.
[1210.18s -> 1217.46s]  That's a double. Let's go up here.
[1217.46s -> 1222.00s]  Hey. Hey, you. Oh, you're real.
[1222.00s -> 1224.82s]  I was going to high five
[1224.82s -> 1232.22s]  him.
[1232.22s -> 1234.22s]  Oh, you want to high five? Oh, sure, I'll
[1234.22s -> 1236.22s]  high five you and then just explode
[1236.22s -> 1239.30s]  myself. Wow,
[1239.30s -> 1241.98s]  that was pretty
[1241.98s -> 1243.98s]  unintelligent of me. But yeah,
[1243.98s -> 1247.68s]  that's what I do.
[1247.68s -> 1249.68s]  All right, new server. I'm gonna say new
[1249.68s -> 1261.57s]  server. Oh, you want to high...
[1261.57s -> 1264.19s]  See, my brain. A lot of you guys already know
[1264.19s -> 1267.33s]  this. Sometimes I just don't think.
[1267.33s -> 1269.89s]  It happens quite often, actually.
[1269.89s -> 1275.76s]  All right, let's see. Let's see
[1275.76s -> 1283.82s]  here. Hmm. I would say
[1283.82s -> 1285.82s]  let's play a randomizer server, but
[1285.82s -> 1287.82s]  for my streams, I like to
[1287.82s -> 1289.82s]  get a lot of people into the games.
[1289.82s -> 1291.82s]  As many people as I possibly can that are
[1291.82s -> 1294.26s]  watching. So, I don't
[1294.26s -> 1296.26s]  want to just, you know, because most of the randomizer
[1296.26s -> 1298.26s]  and arena mod type servers, they're
[1298.26s -> 1300.26s]  always full. They always have, you know,
[1300.26s -> 1302.26s]  23 out of 24, so I would be the only
[1302.26s -> 1304.88s]  one that would be able to get in. So, I
[1304.88s -> 1306.88s]  like to have people from the stream get priority
[1306.88s -> 1308.88s]  and come and play and stuff like that. So,
[1308.88s -> 1312.53s]  let's find another server. This
[1312.53s -> 1314.77s]  one was 32. All right, oh my god,
[1314.77s -> 1319.63s]  there's so many loading. Looking for
[1319.63s -> 1322.19s]  32. High tower, got a bunch of bots,
[1322.19s -> 1327.31s]  eh. Will I ever do a workout
[1327.31s -> 1330.32s]  video? I've
[1330.32s -> 1332.32s]  thrown it around. I was gonna do it a long time
[1332.32s -> 1335.26s]  ago, but it's just, I
[1335.26s -> 1337.26s]  don't know if people would even watch it.
[1337.26s -> 1339.26s]  I know that there would be a very small
[1339.26s -> 1341.89s]  group of people that would probably watch it,
[1341.89s -> 1344.13s]  but I don't know if, like, how
[1344.13s -> 1346.13s]  it would be received. I think a lot of people
[1346.13s -> 1348.13s]  would be like, what the hell are you doing?
[1348.13s -> 1352.27s]  Why are you, like, lifting weights?
[1352.27s -> 1354.51s]  24, 25, 32.
[1354.51s -> 1358.14s]  Uh, okay.
[1358.14s -> 1360.14s]  Well, here we go. Good old fashioned dust ball.
[1360.14s -> 1364.03s]  Here is the IP.
[1364.03s -> 1370.11s]  Oh, and everyone's always asking about
[1370.11s -> 1372.61s]  Enlighten, the new Enlighten.
[1372.61s -> 1374.61s]  I'm working on it right now. So,
[1374.61s -> 1377.04s]  there will be a new Enlighten in the next couple
[1377.04s -> 1384.51s]  of days. Working on it right now.
[1384.51s -> 1386.75s]  Yeah, I'll probably do
[1386.75s -> 1388.75s]  another one of those videos where I give advice,
[1388.75s -> 1390.75s]  and I'll probably do, like, maybe a one or two minute
[1390.75s -> 1392.75s]  a vlog type thing where I show you
[1392.75s -> 1395.44s]  some stuff, but I'm not sure I would do, like,
[1395.44s -> 1397.44s]  a 20 minute workout video.
[1397.44s -> 1399.68s]  Like, okay, then up, then down,
[1399.68s -> 1401.68s]  then up, then left. I think that would
[1401.68s -> 1403.68s]  just be odd. I mean, I think that would be very
[1403.68s -> 1406.82s]  weird. Let's go blue. I was red last time.
[1406.82s -> 1414.88s]  Let's go blue. Boom. Boom. Boom.
[1414.88s -> 1418.45s]  What do I want to use? Oh, the new PDA.
[1418.45s -> 1423.95s]  What's gonna be? Oh my god!
[1423.95s -> 1426.51s]  And up,
[1426.51s -> 1428.51s]  and down, and left, and
[1428.51s -> 1430.51s]  egg.
[1430.51s -> 1435.55s]  And egg.
[1435.55s -> 1437.55s]  Alright, let me say this.
[1437.55s -> 1439.55s]  Would you guys watch an egg workout
[1439.55s -> 1445.82s]  video? Like, if it was the egg.
[1445.82s -> 1450.18s]  What do I want to even play with?
[1450.18s -> 1453.25s]  I'll stay with this. I'll stick with this. Why not?
[1453.25s -> 1459.70s]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1459.70s -> 1462.83s]  This server's like...
[1462.83s -> 1464.83s]  Does this server look weird?
[1464.83s -> 1467.39s]  I'm like, lagging. Oh, I'm trying. I tried to high-five them.
[1467.39s -> 1473.73s]  Oh wait, you can just hold your hand like that?
[1473.73s -> 1476.10s]  Oh yeah. High five,
[1476.10s -> 1479.55s]  baby. Alright, and I don't know
[1479.55s -> 1481.55s]  if it's the server or not, but is everybody
[1481.55s -> 1483.55s]  all jumpy? Because they are on my screen.
[1483.55s -> 1486.80s]  Like, lookit. Does anybody else see that?
[1486.80s -> 1488.78s]  We'll go... I don't wanna...
[1488.78s -> 1493.82s]  We'll go for one or two rounds like this.
[1493.82s -> 1495.22s]  Oh, high five! Here we go!
[1495.22s -> 1499.94s]  Swooping!
[1499.94s -> 1502.76s]  Yeah, I mean...
[1502.76s -> 1508.61s]  Oh god, everyone's like jumping all over the place for me.
[1508.61s -> 1510.69s]  Oh!
[1510.69s -> 1513.02s]  Sentra, damn!
[1513.02s -> 1513.98s]  Hey! Hey!
[1513.98s -> 1514.90s]  Hey!
[1514.90s -> 1520.05s]  What do you think you're doing?
[1520.05s -> 1521.97s]  Oh, I forgot I was gonna answer that question.
[1521.97s -> 1524.25s]  The reason why I don't do auto-reload is cause it...
[1524.25s -> 1525.33s]  Is somebody in here?
[1525.33s -> 1528.78s]  Like, the ghost of the pyro is just in that room with me.
[1528.78s -> 1529.86s]  Oh no!
[1529.86s -> 1533.33s]  Oh god, what do I do?
[1533.33s -> 1537.46s]  Alright, well here we are!
[1537.50s -> 1538.94s]  Oh, I'll block your way out.
[1538.94s -> 1539.74s]  You can't get out!
[1539.74s -> 1541.62s]  You're a dead ringer!
[1541.62s -> 1543.06s]  I got you blocked in!
[1543.06s -> 1544.59s]  Hey!
[1551.44s -> 1552.48s]  There's a tip right there.
[1552.48s -> 1554.24s]  If you shoot a dead ringer and you know he's a dead ringer,
[1554.24s -> 1556.30s]  just stand in the middle of the hallway.
[1556.30s -> 1558.01s]  And he can't get by you.
[1558.01s -> 1561.94s]  At least... At least sometimes.
[1561.94s -> 1562.38s]  Oh.
[1562.38s -> 1563.38s]  Dispatch are going up.
[1563.38s -> 1563.98s]  Up here.
[1563.98s -> 1565.18s]  I don't know why I decided to put them here.
[1565.18s -> 1567.55s]  This is a bad idea.
[1567.55s -> 1570.46s]  Oh jeez!
[1570.46s -> 1571.70s]  Where is my mini Sentra?
[1571.70s -> 1573.22s]  Why is it still alive?
[1573.22s -> 1578.58s]  Oh my god.
[1578.58s -> 1579.34s]  Getting distracted.
[1579.34s -> 1579.82s]  I get distracted.
[1579.82s -> 1581.68s]  I have ADD, man.
[1581.68s -> 1584.43s]  Wow, we already won?
[1584.47s -> 1585.15s]  My goodness.
[1585.15s -> 1590.46s]  Oh my goodness.
[1590.46s -> 1592.10s]  FG Spidey.
[1592.10s -> 1594.20s]  Betcha I can say your name.
[1594.20s -> 1599.11s]  I betcha a dollar I can say your name.
[1599.11s -> 1603.46s]  32-man Dustbowl is chaos.
[1603.46s -> 1607.71s]  I'm gonna go Huntsman Sniper.
[1607.71s -> 1611.97s]  If you want to throw me a duel, I'll absolutely do you.
[1611.97s -> 1616.90s]  Ah!
[1616.90s -> 1617.66s]  Oh, now I got a...
[1617.66s -> 1618.22s]  Oh, let me say it.
[1618.22s -> 1621.87s]  I got a Cyanagosa.
[1621.87s -> 1623.32s]  I think that's how you say it.
[1623.32s -> 1626.86s]  Cyanagosa.
[1626.86s -> 1628.66s]  And oh, by the way, if you're watching this on YouTube,
[1628.66s -> 1631.14s]  because I'm gonna upload this to YouTube afterwards,
[1631.14s -> 1632.90s]  yes, I am responding to people in the chat,
[1632.90s -> 1635.86s]  so don't just think I have some kind of weird disorder
[1635.86s -> 1639.56s]  where I just say random words.
[1639.56s -> 1644.02s]  Like I said that last time, too.
[1644.02s -> 1646.22s]  Oh, come on, this guy's gonna get headshot.
[1646.22s -> 1648.01s]  Right now.
[1648.01s -> 1650.18s]  Right now, here we go, ready?
[1650.18s -> 1653.86s]  I don't think you know, I don't think you understand.
[1653.86s -> 1656.06s]  I don't think you understand, here it comes.
[1656.06s -> 1659.03s]  Oh my god, he killed me.
[1659.03s -> 1662.66s]  Oh no, a different guy did.
[1662.66s -> 1664.95s]  Eggs.
[1664.95s -> 1671.62s]  Look at this egg.
[1671.62s -> 1673.50s]  Man, this server is lagging for me.
[1673.50s -> 1674.34s]  I'll tell you right now.
[1674.34s -> 1679.73s]  Oh, look at this double spy collateral.
[1679.73s -> 1687.23s]  Oh no, run away.
[1687.23s -> 1692.66s]  Oh, attack!
[1693.14s -> 1694.22s]  I can't even aim at people.
[1694.22s -> 1698.10s]  My screen is like, take a jellyfish.
[1698.10s -> 1698.94s]  Oh, he got me.
[1698.94s -> 1712.10s]  Oh, look at this server.
[1712.10s -> 1713.30s]  I don't think this server was designed
[1713.30s -> 1716.21s]  to have this many people in it.
[1716.21s -> 1718.78s]  Oh, what, you wanna get covered in Jirardi?
[1718.78s -> 1719.62s]  Is that what you're saying?
[1719.62s -> 1720.78s]  You want me to come smash you?
[1720.78s -> 1721.62s]  Is that what you just said?
[1721.62s -> 1723.70s]  You want me to come smash your face in?
[1723.70s -> 1727.98s]  I got him.
[1727.98s -> 1730.31s]  Fan of Kid Icarus, I never played it.
[1730.31s -> 1732.51s]  Not even the original, and I'm an old bastard,
[1732.51s -> 1737.78s]  and I didn't even play the original.
[1737.78s -> 1740.86s]  Oh, that would've been sick.
[1740.86s -> 1748.02s]  I hurt somebody.
[1748.02s -> 1753.54s]  God, I love to kill somebody, finally.
[1753.54s -> 1754.70s]  I got my first kill ever.
[1754.74s -> 1758.30s]  Whoa, did you see where I shot?
[1758.30s -> 1760.30s]  If you're watching this on YouTube,
[1760.30s -> 1762.50s]  please rewind that and look at where I shot.
[1762.50s -> 1764.82s]  I shot like five feet over that guy's head,
[1764.82s -> 1767.39s]  and I still killed him.
[1767.39s -> 1774.08s]  No, oh God.
[1774.08s -> 1776.55s]  Let's just, all right, let's do it.
[1780.36s -> 1788.26s]  Oh, there was no way I was gonna get out of there.
[1788.26s -> 1791.63s]  A good, affordable graphics card.
[1791.63s -> 1794.24s]  That's a good one.
[1794.24s -> 1799.61s]  I'd say probably the GTX 550 or the 560.
[1800.34s -> 1803.72s]  I think those are both under 200 bucks, I think.
[1804.68s -> 1805.52s]  I don't know, under 100.
[1805.52s -> 1807.12s]  I think the 550 is, I don't know, the 550 Ti,
[1807.12s -> 1807.96s]  I think it's called.
[1807.96s -> 1809.52s]  I don't even remember.
[1809.52s -> 1810.60s]  Boom.
[1810.60s -> 1812.45s]  Oh, I missed him.
[1812.45s -> 1816.15s]  Oh God.
[1816.15s -> 1821.02s]  I think eggs should be a weapon.
[1821.02s -> 1822.50s]  I don't know how well they'd work.
[1822.50s -> 1825.96s]  Oh, SimSass, you got the 550?
[1825.96s -> 1829.47s]  Is the, how much is the 550?
[1829.47s -> 1837.49s]  And follow-up, is it a good graphics card?
[1837.49s -> 1838.93s]  Did you, did you, did you, did you, did you?
[1838.93s -> 1841.64s]  Oh my God.
[1841.64s -> 1842.92s]  Hey, what's going on?
[1842.92s -> 1848.21s]  Just hiding over here, away from you.
[1848.21s -> 1856.96s]  No, no, please don't kill me, please.
[1856.96s -> 1862.81s]  Did you buy the 550 or did it come with your computer?
[1862.81s -> 1867.84s]  I'm still like thinking.
[1867.84s -> 1868.68s]  Medic, cover me.
[1868.68s -> 1873.44s]  Oh, I didn't get him.
[1873.44s -> 1874.28s]  Okay, yeah.
[1874.28s -> 1877.45s]  So the 550 is only like 130 bucks.
[1877.45s -> 1879.01s]  I'd say that's a good graphics card
[1879.01s -> 1882.13s]  to be able to save a little bit of money.
[1882.13s -> 1886.29s]  Because the 580 is, geez, what, like $500?
[1886.29s -> 1888.87s]  Something like that.
[1888.87s -> 1891.21s]  I know it's up there.
[1891.21s -> 1893.33s]  And they're already working on the 600, aren't they?
[1893.33s -> 1899.82s]  The 600 series.
[1899.82s -> 1901.09s]  Is that?
[1901.09s -> 1901.93s]  Okay, you're real.
[1901.93s -> 1902.75s]  You're the real deal.
[1902.75s -> 1908.50s]  I got you.
[1908.50s -> 1909.32s]  Oh, I'll cover them all.
[1909.32s -> 1910.16s]  Okay, okay.
[1910.16s -> 1912.94s]  Did I even get, no.
[1912.94s -> 1918.81s]  Get this one guy, come on.
[1918.81s -> 1920.21s]  The 680 is out now?
[1920.21s -> 1921.57s]  Oh dear Lord, what is that?
[1921.57s -> 1926.68s]  Like $900?
[1926.68s -> 1931.96s]  Can only imagine.
[1931.96s -> 1937.86s]  Woo!
[1937.86s -> 1942.54s]  I don't think we're going to win this.
[1942.54s -> 1949.70s]  Oh God, there's people over there too.
[1949.70s -> 1953.28s]  All right, I'm going this way.
[1953.28s -> 1954.60s]  Nobody up here?
[1954.60s -> 1957.58s]  We almost just got it.
[1957.58s -> 1960.29s]  Oh, he's still alive, he's still alive.
[1960.29s -> 1962.04s]  Hey, he's turned around, he's behind you.
[1962.04s -> 1965.14s]  Oh my God.
[1965.14s -> 1970.52s]  Dude, you just like crushed that guy.
[1970.52s -> 1972.84s]  Geez.
[1972.84s -> 1977.43s]  Oh, forget that, I'm going this way.
[1977.43s -> 1978.27s]  Oh my God.
[1983.55s -> 1985.59s]  What's my favorite movie?
[1985.59s -> 1990.14s]  Hmm, I don't know.
[1990.14s -> 1994.10s]  Probably Ghostbusters, or Memento, or The Dark Knight,
[1994.10s -> 1996.63s]  or one of the Muppet movies,
[1996.63s -> 2000.37s]  or there's a lot of movies I've watched that I like.
[2000.37s -> 2001.41s]  I'm not a big movie watcher though.
[2001.41s -> 2005.79s]  I'm not even a big TV watcher either.
[2005.79s -> 2014.80s]  Oh my God, I just missed his head.
[2014.80s -> 2016.44s]  Oh, this guy could be toast.
[2016.44s -> 2019.50s]  Oh my God.
[2021.34s -> 2024.15s]  They're all here for me.
[2024.15s -> 2027.62s]  Oh, this guy doesn't even know I'm here.
[2027.62s -> 2034.66s]  Damn it.
[2034.66s -> 2036.10s]  Fight Club is also a good one, Ari.
[2036.10s -> 2039.78s]  Fight Club is a good one.
[2039.78s -> 2042.61s]  I remember the first time I watched Fight Club.
[2042.61s -> 2043.57s]  I was so confused.
[2043.57s -> 2047.68s]  I think I was like 16, or like 17.
[2047.68s -> 2048.92s]  When did that movie come out?
[2048.92s -> 2050.64s]  Somebody do a quick research and find out
[2050.64s -> 2051.88s]  when did Fight Club release it?
[2051.88s -> 2054.87s]  When did it come out in theaters?
[2054.87s -> 2056.35s]  Get somebody right in the foot, ready?
[2056.35s -> 2057.19s]  Right in the toe.
[2057.19s -> 2059.68s]  Aw.
[2059.68s -> 2064.68s]  Oh my God, hide.
[2064.68s -> 2067.69s]  Hey, you wanna see if like grandpa can beat box?
[2067.69s -> 2069.69s]  I don't think he can.
[2069.69s -> 2072.57s]  I would assume grandpa could not beat box.
[2072.57s -> 2075.52s]  1999, okay.
[2075.52s -> 2079.30s]  Oh, so that means I was.
[2079.30s -> 2083.33s]  So 10 years ago was 2009, so 10, 11, 12.
[2083.33s -> 2086.40s]  So that was 13 years ago.
[2086.40s -> 2089.64s]  I was, hmm.
[2089.68s -> 2095.10s]  So I'm 26, 16, 15, 14, 13.
[2095.10s -> 2096.98s]  I definitely didn't watch it when I was 13.
[2096.98s -> 2104.75s]  I don't think my parents would have let me do that.
[2104.75s -> 2106.67s]  I mean, once I watched it,
[2106.67s -> 2107.95s]  I think the first time I watched it
[2107.95s -> 2112.29s]  when I was like 15 or 16, something like that,
[2112.29s -> 2114.34s]  and I was confused.
[2114.34s -> 2118.56s]  I was absolutely confused.
[2118.56s -> 2121.72s]  Office Space is a good movie, too.
[2121.72s -> 2123.20s]  The thing is, I've seen a lot of movies,
[2123.20s -> 2124.72s]  but I don't watch a lot of movies.
[2124.72s -> 2126.72s]  If that makes any sense to anybody,
[2126.72s -> 2131.57s]  then oh my God, I just accidentally got that guy.
[2131.57s -> 2132.41s]  Greetings from Chile.
[2132.57s -> 2137.11s]  Greetings from East Coast, USA, dude.
[2137.11s -> 2138.95s]  It's either very early or very late for you.
[2138.95s -> 2139.79s]  I'm not sure.
[2139.79s -> 2141.69s]  Actually, no, I think we're in the same time zone.
[2141.69s -> 2144.68s]  We're close, the same time zone.
[2144.68s -> 2145.80s]  Oh my God.
[2145.80s -> 2150.94s]  All right, time to play Scout.
[2150.94s -> 2153.63s]  My real name is Jeremy.
[2153.63s -> 2159.56s]  It's Jeremy, J-E-R-E-M-Y.
[2159.56s -> 2160.80s]  Look at all these people he's blowing out.
[2160.80s -> 2163.18s]  Look at this good pyro right here.
[2163.18s -> 2166.66s]  Just running around blowing all the teammates out.
[2166.66s -> 2170.14s]  You get a gold star.
[2170.14s -> 2171.74s]  No, it's not Jeremiah.
[2171.74s -> 2174.87s]  It's just Jeremy.
[2174.87s -> 2181.95s]  Oh, there's a lot of people right there.
[2181.95s -> 2189.26s]  Hmm, watch it, watch it, watch it.
[2189.86s -> 2192.82s]  All right, Scout's not gonna work.
[2192.82s -> 2195.32s]  I'll go medic.
[2195.32s -> 2196.44s]  Do I like Irish people?
[2196.44s -> 2199.02s]  I do, I am Irish.
[2199.02s -> 2206.58s]  I am Irish, so.
[2206.58s -> 2207.78s]  Look at this server.
[2207.78s -> 2212.05s]  All right, I'm gonna change servers after I die next
[2212.05s -> 2214.54s]  just because this server is very laggy.
[2214.54s -> 2215.38s]  Look at this guy.
[2215.38s -> 2217.29s]  It looks like he's part of a claymation.
[2217.29s -> 2225.66s]  Look at this claymation server we're on.
[2225.66s -> 2231.58s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[2231.58s -> 2232.82s]  Oh, this is why I like the quick fix
[2232.82s -> 2234.98s]  because you can just do this and it makes sense.
[2234.98s -> 2240.08s]  Oh my God, that was the guy I just healed.
[2240.08s -> 2246.27s]  New server.
[2246.27s -> 2249.11s]  That new server, what's this?
[2249.15s -> 2254.18s]  Oh yeah, he defeated me.
[2254.18s -> 2256.54s]  Probably hop on one more server
[2256.54s -> 2259.13s]  and try some Tribes of Sen
[2259.13s -> 2263.44s]  because that game is really cool.
[2263.44s -> 2265.52s]  Let's go zero out of 24 this time
[2265.52s -> 2271.67s]  just to keep the lag factor down a little.
[2271.67s -> 2273.59s]  King of the Hill Sawmill, no.
[2273.59s -> 2277.23s]  King of the Hill Nucleus, that could be good.
[2277.23s -> 2281.84s]  Mm-mm, no.
[2281.84s -> 2284.20s]  King of the Hill, no.
[2284.20s -> 2286.42s]  High tower, eh.
[2286.42s -> 2290.73s]  I'm torn, guys, I don't know where to go.
[2290.73s -> 2293.17s]  You are garbage, Jerva, why?
[2293.17s -> 2300.23s]  What did I do?
[2300.23s -> 2309.70s]  Badwater Mountain Lab, a day in the life of Jerva.
[2310.54s -> 2316.46s]  Where I just eat like Cheetos and take a bath.
[2316.46s -> 2319.20s]  All right, we're gonna go here.
[2319.20s -> 2322.92s]  We're gonna go to Viaduct.
[2322.92s -> 2333.38s]  Coth Viaduct, there's the IP.
[2333.38s -> 2335.55s]  I put the IP right in the chat.
[2335.55s -> 2341.72s]  Should say a little camera next to my name.
[2341.72s -> 2350.42s]  Oh, let's go.
[2351.94s -> 2355.19s]  Let's go spy.
[2355.19s -> 2356.27s]  This is a very weird load-up.
[2356.27s -> 2364.46s]  I'm not sure what I was trying to do here.
[2364.46s -> 2371.66s]  Oh, I got the strange dead ringer.
[2371.66s -> 2373.22s]  The server's full, the server's full.
[2373.22s -> 2383.79s]  Sermer, what am I talking about?
[2383.79s -> 2386.76s]  If you can't get in or you're trying to get in,
[2386.76s -> 2393.46s]  I do apologize.
[2393.46s -> 2398.42s]  I think I do have a strange, oh, death.
[2398.42s -> 2400.98s]  Thanks for pointing that out.
[2400.98s -> 2403.26s]  Well, it's gonna belong to somebody else pretty soon,
[2403.26s -> 2411.58s]  so might as well rack up as many kills on it as I can, right?
[2411.58s -> 2413.14s]  Hey, look, I'm an engineer walking at you
[2413.14s -> 2414.46s]  from the other side.
[2414.46s -> 2415.80s]  Oh, you got me.
[2415.80s -> 2430.73s]  Damn, how dare you kill me like that.
[2430.73s -> 2435.30s]  If I could go pro at any sport, baseball.
[2435.30s -> 2438.66s]  I've always wanted to be a baseball player.
[2438.66s -> 2442.13s]  Not exactly sure why, but I just have.
[2442.13s -> 2445.27s]  Used to play baseball when I was younger.
[2445.27s -> 2452.74s]  Into high school, then I stopped in high school.
[2452.74s -> 2453.90s]  Oh, my death.
[2453.94s -> 2455.18s]  So that way, now they're gonna all know
[2455.18s -> 2456.42s]  that I just dead rung.
[2456.42s -> 2464.09s]  Dead rung, is that even like a word?
[2464.09s -> 2465.69s]  Oh, let's protect this point.
[2465.69s -> 2469.41s]  I'm a pyro, I do that the best.
[2469.41s -> 2478.71s]  That was just a scared chaos stab right there.
[2478.71s -> 2479.99s]  Now, what are you wearing?
[2479.99s -> 2485.15s]  Oh, the team is still trickling in.
[2485.15s -> 2489.22s]  Well, look, I'm just coming out of spawn myself.
[2489.22s -> 2490.58s]  Hey, look, so let's get out of spawn together.
[2490.58s -> 2495.08s]  What did, what?
[2495.08s -> 2496.20s]  Oh, Jerma, I'm cheating.
[2496.20s -> 2502.09s]  I'm watching your stream.
[2502.09s -> 2505.55s]  Is my name even Jerma right now yet?
[2505.55s -> 2512.34s]  Oh, Scrumpadump, Harvey Hamburger, George Bumberson.
[2512.34s -> 2516.79s]  I go by a lot of different titles.
[2516.79s -> 2517.87s]  I won't get out of my way.
[2518.63s -> 2520.80s]  Oh, you son of a B.
[2520.80s -> 2523.00s]  Well, that's like five million deaths in a row.
[2523.00s -> 2532.19s]  Is a spy, time to change something else.
[2532.19s -> 2536.07s]  Low FPS.
[2536.07s -> 2537.98s]  Oh, what am I even using?
[2537.98s -> 2540.30s]  Okay, I'll rock with this.
[2540.30s -> 2545.08s]  I'll roll with this, I'm cool with that.
[2545.08s -> 2553.18s]  Thought there was a spy.
[2553.18s -> 2557.78s]  Oh, what just happened?
[2557.78s -> 2560.12s]  Oh, my brain.
[2560.12s -> 2561.20s]  There was a soldier right there?
[2561.20s -> 2562.24s]  Oh, I just killed that medic.
[2562.24s -> 2568.38s]  I'm sorry, dude.
[2568.38s -> 2575.56s]  I don't think I've ever had a embarrassing name.
[2575.56s -> 2577.52s]  Oh, my preferred breakfast food?
[2577.52s -> 2579.49s]  Oh, are you kidding me?
[2579.49s -> 2583.98s]  Eggs, I had to say.
[2583.98s -> 2586.14s]  What do we got here?
[2586.14s -> 2586.98s]  No more fooling around.
[2587.02s -> 2590.66s]  Let's get some kills.
[2590.66s -> 2592.98s]  Let's kill some bastards.
[2592.98s -> 2594.47s]  Get on this point.
[2594.47s -> 2597.79s]  Boys and girls.
[2597.79s -> 2602.60s]  Oh, where is he?
[2602.60s -> 2605.36s]  You are a spy.
[2605.36s -> 2611.94s]  Yep, because you're invisible now.
[2611.94s -> 2615.93s]  Well, that was a total not good idea.
[2615.93s -> 2618.95s]  Oh, what was, what?
[2618.95s -> 2623.08s]  Did I jump in the air?
[2623.08s -> 2630.02s]  Did I, what just happened to me?
[2630.02s -> 2633.46s]  I don't even understand how that happened.
[2633.46s -> 2635.69s]  Maybe I did jump.
[2635.69s -> 2640.49s]  That's a buzz veered.
[2640.49s -> 2649.06s]  Kill Jerma, nice name.
[2649.06s -> 2651.55s]  Well, at least I got one kill.
[2651.55s -> 2655.63s]  Tad around.
[2655.63s -> 2661.33s]  Boink, boink, boink.
[2661.33s -> 2662.29s]  How do you open console?
[2662.29s -> 2673.71s]  It's the tilde key, the thing under escape.
[2673.71s -> 2677.44s]  Oh, I gotta do some expert rocket jumping, guys.
[2677.44s -> 2679.10s]  Here we go.
[2679.10s -> 2682.21s]  Expert rocket jumper.
[2682.21s -> 2683.05s]  Check me out.
[2683.05s -> 2691.09s]  I'll be on, I don't even know what the name of the site is.
[2691.09s -> 2694.52s]  So wait, why would I give up TF2?
[2694.52s -> 2701.81s]  I thought I made this explicitly clear that I never was.
[2701.81s -> 2711.49s]  TF2 is a huge part of my existence.
[2711.49s -> 2714.18s]  Otto, Otto.
[2714.18s -> 2715.89s]  Where is Otto?
[2715.89s -> 2718.00s]  That's a good question.
[2718.00s -> 2719.56s]  That's a sniper and he's gonna, no, he's not.
[2719.56s -> 2724.10s]  What is that?
[2724.10s -> 2727.86s]  God, that was awful.
[2727.86s -> 2732.83s]  Here we go.
[2733.11s -> 2743.96s]  Can I get like a string of two and three in a row here?
[2751.83s -> 2763.17s]  And you, at least I'm killing people now.
[2763.17s -> 2774.68s]  Oh, my Liberty Launcher is now a new rank.
[2774.68s -> 2777.52s]  Yeah, I understand that phenomenal.
[2777.52s -> 2779.94s]  But to be honest, the items that I have
[2779.94s -> 2782.21s]  in my backpack right now, I mean,
[2782.21s -> 2783.21s]  I know I can understand like,
[2783.21s -> 2786.25s]  oh, he's giving away his whole backpack, he's gonna quit.
[2786.25s -> 2788.93s]  I understand that, but I mean,
[2788.93s -> 2792.06s]  I have a lot of friends in Team Fortress
[2792.06s -> 2795.34s]  and a lot of people that, oh God, hold on.
[2795.34s -> 2798.95s]  Oh God, I just totally ruined that bush.
[2798.99s -> 2801.11s]  Oh my God.
[2801.11s -> 2803.19s]  But I got a lot of friends in Team Fortress
[2803.19s -> 2806.61s]  and I have a lot of people that support me with this channel.
[2806.61s -> 2809.93s]  So any item that I ever wanna use, I can just get it back.
[2809.93s -> 2812.09s]  It might not be strange, it might not be genuine,
[2812.09s -> 2814.38s]  but that's, I don't care.
[2814.38s -> 2817.18s]  I figured because, like I said in the video,
[2817.18s -> 2819.66s]  I started with Team Fortress 2
[2819.66s -> 2823.76s]  and I got all the support from you guys from Team Fortress,
[2823.76s -> 2826.37s]  a lot of you guys are Team Fortress guys,
[2826.37s -> 2830.38s]  and that was a decent, decent shot.
[2830.38s -> 2831.82s]  And that's why I felt like doing it,
[2831.82s -> 2833.76s]  you know, just something I felt like doing.
[2833.76s -> 2836.82s]  And mine's made up, there's no going back now,
[2836.82s -> 2838.02s]  so it's gonna happen.
[2839.06s -> 2849.20s]  And let's see if I can, no, there's a mini sentry.
[2849.20s -> 2854.15s]  All right, after this round, go to one more server
[2854.15s -> 2862.44s]  and then I'm gonna hop and drive to send.
[2862.44s -> 2863.28s]  Boing, boing.
[2868.34s -> 2871.28s]  No, that was laggy.
[2871.28s -> 2874.74s]  Oh, I didn't wanna do that.
[2874.74s -> 2881.62s]  Oh my God, what is going on with that guy?
[2881.62s -> 2886.04s]  That guy was just skydiving right there.
[2886.04s -> 2895.93s]  Oh, I'm dead, I am so dead.
[2895.93s -> 2897.57s]  Diddy, diddy, diddy, diddy, diddy.
[2897.57s -> 2903.09s]  Oh, you lagged out, yeah.
[2903.09s -> 2916.18s]  Boom, mission ends in 60 seconds.
[2916.18s -> 2918.40s]  Oh, how did I not hit him?
[2918.40s -> 2922.15s]  Mini sentry, get out of here.
[2922.15s -> 2931.14s]  Oh, there's a sniper, good to know.
[2931.14s -> 2936.78s]  Oh, this is where we get in trouble.
[2936.78s -> 2942.08s]  Somebody snip us, he's still alive.
[2942.08s -> 2949.59s]  Watch the spawn, Optimus Prime is on the loose.
[2949.59s -> 2957.68s]  No, you're real, where could he be?
[2957.68s -> 2963.83s]  Gotta get on that point, get on it, there we go.
[2963.83s -> 2975.93s]  Everyone just stop on here right now, there we go.
[2975.93s -> 2986.66s]  All right, one minute 40 seconds, we got this.
[2986.66s -> 2990.34s]  Hmm, you gotta back up.
[2990.34s -> 2991.78s]  Damn, every time I shoot a crit rocket,
[2991.78s -> 3000.38s]  it just goes right by everybody.
[3000.38s -> 3009.42s]  Oh, boom, oh, no, no, no.
[3009.42s -> 3017.18s]  No, I just ruined this again.
[3017.18s -> 3019.50s]  Oh, I'm sorry medic, I'm an idiot.
[3027.56s -> 3035.31s]  Aw, yeah, Tribes is a free-to-play game right now.
[3035.31s -> 3037.93s]  I would suggest everyone to go get it.
[3037.93s -> 3041.89s]  If you play Team Fortress, you'll probably like Tribes.
[3041.89s -> 3045.88s]  It's just another one of those kind of fast-paced,
[3045.88s -> 3049.02s]  you know, projectile-based, crazy fun games.
[3049.02s -> 3051.55s]  FPS, it's first person shooter.
[3052.39s -> 3058.43s]  All right, so let's add a new server, new server.
[3058.43s -> 3060.19s]  All right, we'll do one more server here,
[3060.19s -> 3061.55s]  then I'm gonna hop into Tribes
[3061.55s -> 3074.10s]  for probably like a half an hour or so.
[3074.10s -> 3078.94s]  So we have 32, okay, let's go to,
[3078.94s -> 3083.24s]  we got, this one is open and it's Dustbowl.
[3083.24s -> 3087.66s]  Huh, we just did, we already did Dustbowl.
[3087.66s -> 3092.69s]  Busytown, what the hell is Busytown?
[3092.69s -> 3096.50s]  This one's well, we can do well.
[3096.50s -> 3100.37s]  Actually, no, no, no, no, that server might not be able to.
[3100.37s -> 3104.38s]  All right, we'll go to this one, CTF well.
[3104.38s -> 3116.94s]  And there you are, everyone join it.
[3116.98s -> 3119.47s]  Empty randomizer?
[3119.47s -> 3129.46s]  Um, I mean, eh, I mean, randomizer, is it really empty?
[3129.46s -> 3139.64s]  So those servers are like legit empty right now?
[3139.64s -> 3146.70s]  No, okay, next week we'll do randomizer.
[3146.70s -> 3153.38s]  We'll do some randomizer next week.
[3153.38s -> 3157.96s]  I'm gonna use the shortstop.
[3157.96s -> 3160.32s]  And I'm gonna put on the whole set.
[3160.32s -> 3161.52s]  Why not, right?
[3161.52s -> 3171.82s]  Why not?
[3171.82s -> 3176.42s]  Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3176.42s -> 3179.46s]  Oh, the round's not even started, I'm gonna get a kill.
[3179.46s -> 3186.86s]  No, I'm not, too bad, woohoo.
[3186.86s -> 3188.14s]  Oh, I'm gonna sneeze, I gotta sneeze
[3188.14s -> 3190.28s]  and there's nothing I can do about it.
[3190.32s -> 3193.32s]  Oh, I'm gonna sneeze, here it comes.
[3193.32s -> 3195.34s]  No, no, false alarm.
[3195.34s -> 3200.06s]  No, oh man, sorry.
[3200.06s -> 3203.49s]  There's no button I can press to mute me.
[3203.49s -> 3204.73s]  Are we getting spawn trapped?
[3204.73s -> 3207.79s]  What's going on?
[3207.79s -> 3212.33s]  Thank you.
[3212.33s -> 3224.82s]  Mark, get me in here.
[3224.82s -> 3229.01s]  Oh god, they're gonna get crits.
[3229.01s -> 3240.73s]  Damn, itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout.
[3240.73s -> 3248.13s]  Down came the rain and wiped out that god damn spider.
[3248.29s -> 3252.72s]  I just bumped into a spy, but I don't care.
[3252.72s -> 3258.39s]  Oh, get away from me, oh man.
[3264.19s -> 3265.55s]  No, you are not, you are real.
[3265.55s -> 3274.94s]  Well, is, he's still alive.
[3274.94s -> 3277.99s]  No, he's not, wait, what?
[3277.99s -> 3280.03s]  How is that, unless I actually really just killed him,
[3280.03s -> 3283.40s]  I don't think I did though.
[3283.40s -> 3289.36s]  Go up top, there's the health, that's what I wanted.
[3289.36s -> 3297.43s]  Oh god, no, this just bounced off the door
[3297.43s -> 3304.46s]  and came back at me in the face.
[3304.46s -> 3312.93s]  Oh, come on away, give me my milk, give me my milk.
[3312.93s -> 3323.10s]  Oh, all right, seven level, thanks for coming, man.
[3323.10s -> 3325.02s]  Will they ever do more duel commentaries?
[3325.02s -> 3329.42s]  Oh, hell yeah, I just did one the other night
[3329.42s -> 3340.71s]  on CSGO with MLC stealth.
[3340.71s -> 3342.31s]  Oh, just jump over everybody,
[3342.31s -> 3343.78s]  try and get around.
[3343.78s -> 3348.90s]  Oh, I was gonna get hit by the train.
[3348.90s -> 3351.26s]  Get me out of here, get me away from me.
[3351.26s -> 3357.86s]  Come on, just give me the stupid intelligence.
[3357.86s -> 3360.42s]  D-A-M-M, damn, damn.
[3370.60s -> 3376.02s]  Oh, what just, oh, I got backstabbed.
[3376.02s -> 3389.30s]  Dang it, do do do, do do do, special delivery.
[3389.30s -> 3396.37s]  All right, do do do, was this in the lower right?
[3396.37s -> 3400.36s]  Jerma sucks at TF2.
[3400.36s -> 3409.12s]  Oh, we got a troll, we got a troll.
[3409.12s -> 3410.64s]  All right, one more round of this.
[3410.68s -> 3417.59s]  I'm gonna go pyro this time.
[3417.59s -> 3429.20s]  Hmm, I always do not, I don't put on, let's go, yeah.
[3429.20s -> 3430.04s]  All right, last round,
[3430.04s -> 3446.78s]  then I'm gonna hop over to tribes, ascend, damn, ah.
[3446.78s -> 3450.58s]  All right, I gotta appear offline.
[3450.58s -> 3452.82s]  We can't have any spam coming at me,
[3452.82s -> 3459.79s]  especially when it has bad, bad things.
[3459.79s -> 3467.74s]  Do do do do do do, oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[3467.74s -> 3468.66s]  Is somebody behind us still?
[3468.66s -> 3471.40s]  Oh, there he is.
[3471.40s -> 3477.34s]  No, God, I turned and saw the goddamn train.
[3477.34s -> 3482.02s]  Oh, I don't think I even have the hat,
[3482.02s -> 3485.48s]  but the degreaser said, to be honest.
[3485.48s -> 3489.38s]  Nah, I don't have the hat.
[3489.38s -> 3491.22s]  You know, I saw, I thought I could get by,
[3491.22s -> 3500.09s]  and then I turned and scared the crap out of myself.
[3500.09s -> 3502.77s]  Oh my God, they have crits, shoot at me.
[3502.77s -> 3508.38s]  Come on, all right, don't get hit by the train again.
[3508.38s -> 3520.96s]  Oh, oh, I almost got hit by the train again.
[3520.96s -> 3522.48s]  No, I'm gonna whack you.
[3522.48s -> 3536.22s]  Oh, damn it, where is Burger Boy?
[3536.22s -> 3542.59s]  Where is Burger Boy?
[3542.59s -> 3548.45s]  How am I not letting him on fire?
[3548.45s -> 3550.09s]  Oh, does that mean we're gonna play
[3550.09s -> 3552.08s]  tribes, ascend with Burger Boy?
[3552.08s -> 3561.20s]  Special guest appearance from Burger Boy?
[3561.24s -> 3565.79s]  God damn it, Burger Boy, reveal yourself.
[3565.79s -> 3568.58s]  He has?
[3568.58s -> 3573.25s]  Burger Boy, Burger Boy's been in videos.
[3573.25s -> 3581.17s]  Oh, I'm out of ammo, oh, oh God.
[3581.17s -> 3586.61s]  Oh, my power jack, would I get one kill with it?
[3586.61s -> 3588.98s]  All right, train, me versus you.
[3588.98s -> 3590.82s]  What do you say, buddy, let's do this.
[3595.72s -> 3599.14s]  I lost.
[3607.47s -> 3608.71s]  Oh, we got crits.
[3608.71s -> 3614.62s]  Yes, I just wanna crit fire somebody.
[3614.62s -> 3623.91s]  Yeah, feels good to crit fire.
[3623.91s -> 3626.42s]  It feels good to crit fire.
[3626.42s -> 3630.18s]  All right, we're going sniper.
[3630.18s -> 3636.03s]  No, we're not, I'm going heavy.
[3636.03s -> 3639.72s]  Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[3639.72s -> 3644.61s]  Get away, oh, come on, right when I get out of spawn.
[3644.61s -> 3648.93s]  B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T,
[3648.93s -> 3655.85s]  with six exclamation points after that.
[3655.85s -> 3659.59s]  Wait, why do I have the Natasha equipped?
[3659.59s -> 3667.59s]  Okay, whatever, I'm so scared.
[3667.59s -> 3671.62s]  All right, I killed the spy from like 5,000 feet away.
[3671.62s -> 3672.46s]  Where is this guy?
[3672.46s -> 3675.37s]  Oh, my God, he's on the roof.
[3675.37s -> 3678.76s]  I thought he was to the right.
[3678.76s -> 3680.68s]  All right, take this stupid thing off.
[3680.68s -> 3691.54s]  Give me the regular minigun.
[3692.54s -> 3699.04s]  All right, I gotta like really watch my back now.
[3699.04s -> 3701.08s]  Playing heavy, like probably the worst idea
[3701.08s -> 3705.62s]  I could have ever done.
[3705.62s -> 3709.38s]  I'm gonna be on fire, die, die, die, die, get away, get away.
[3709.38s -> 3710.54s]  Oh, thank you so much.
[3710.54s -> 3717.84s]  Oh, no, here comes another dude.
[3717.84s -> 3719.28s]  How are you still alive?
[3719.28s -> 3720.12s]  What?
[3720.12s -> 3722.36s]  I get hit by the train again.
[3729.15s -> 3731.94s]  Of course I get hit by the train again.
[3731.94s -> 3734.71s]  That would absolutely happen.
[3734.71s -> 3736.15s]  Oh, for the love of God.
[3739.78s -> 3742.54s]  Hey, we're gonna get crits, I think.
[3742.54s -> 3745.70s]  I hope we get crits right now.
[3745.70s -> 3747.90s]  Oh, my God, of course.
[3747.90s -> 3756.54s]  We get crits and I die and I'm dead.
[3756.54s -> 3759.99s]  Ugh.
[3759.99s -> 3770.26s]  Take that, take this, take that.
[3770.26s -> 3772.62s]  How are you still alive?
[3772.62s -> 3777.19s]  I knew it, I knew there was a guy behind me.
[3777.19s -> 3780.35s]  You got 32 person servers that are just like ridiculous.
[3780.35s -> 3785.94s]  They are like insane, insanity.
[3785.94s -> 3787.70s]  It's like you walk out the door and it's just like,
[3787.70s -> 3796.26s]  oh, where is this guy?
[3796.26s -> 3798.10s]  I'm so scared of the spy just backstabbing me.
[3798.10s -> 3804.78s]  It's definitely gonna happen, like right now.
[3804.78s -> 3811.66s]  Yo, I'll get hit by the train again.
[3811.66s -> 3812.50s]  Oh, we won?
[3812.50s -> 3813.34s]  How did we win?
[3813.34s -> 3817.15s]  How am I in the number two right now?
[3823.84s -> 3825.84s]  All right, well, good night if you're leaving, man.
[3825.84s -> 3827.62s]  Thanks for coming.
[3827.62s -> 3830.30s]  So now I'm gonna head on to tribes.
[3830.30s -> 3838.56s]  Send time dudes and dudettes.
[3838.56s -> 3841.88s]  Thanks for playing, everybody.
[3841.88s -> 3848.82s]  All right, so I think I might invite a few people
[3848.82s -> 3852.79s]  into the call that have tribes.
[3852.79s -> 3858.15s]  Let's see how that goes.
[3858.15s -> 3859.47s]  I gotta change this to say,
[3859.47s -> 3861.78s]  I might actually do that in a minute.
[3861.78s -> 3862.62s]  Let me open up tribes.
[3862.62s -> 3865.57s]  The screen might go black for a second, guys.
[3865.57s -> 3870.09s]  So I apologize.
[3870.09s -> 3874.98s]  Screen is going to go black.
[3874.98s -> 3878.34s]  So bear with me for one second.
[3879.18s -> 3882.76s]  While I load up tribes, send.
[3882.76s -> 3886.26s]  Oh, I have ADHD, crazy bad.
[3886.26s -> 3890.66s]  I have really bad ADHD.
[3890.66s -> 3892.21s]  Jerma is dead.
[3892.21s -> 3895.02s]  I'm still here.
[3895.02s -> 3903.03s]  Darkness, it's all I see.
[3903.03s -> 3905.54s]  I already did a setup video, Hannibal.
[3905.54s -> 3907.90s]  Go to my 4,000 subscriber video.
[3907.90s -> 3911.96s]  It should be there.
[3911.96s -> 3913.44s]  Don't go into the light.
[3913.44s -> 3916.93s]  Now, my children, let me tell you something.
[3916.93s -> 3921.42s]  I am God coming to you from the black screen.
[3921.42s -> 3923.10s]  Let me tell you, all you need to do
[3923.10s -> 3925.90s]  to have a good, fun, interesting life
[3925.90s -> 3933.29s]  is to crash, because that's what I think I just did.
[3933.29s -> 3934.41s]  Oh, no, no, I'm just, I'm here.
[3934.41s -> 3936.80s]  Okay, okay, hold on.
[3936.80s -> 3938.56s]  I really thought I just hard crashed right there.
[3938.56s -> 3942.29s]  That would have been bad.
[3942.29s -> 3945.56s]  All right, let me get into the game.
[3945.56s -> 3952.85s]  Screen should come back in about 10 seconds, guys.
[3952.85s -> 3957.72s]  Settings, audio, yeah, that's fine.
[3957.72s -> 3962.70s]  Video, window, come on, let's go window, windowed.
[3962.70s -> 3968.00s]  All right, now I'm coming back.
[3968.00s -> 3974.86s]  Change the resolution.
[3974.86s -> 3977.51s]  All righty, let me just add this game
[3977.55s -> 3984.85s]  as a source into XSplit, and we should be good to go.
[3984.85s -> 3988.62s]  Game, hello.
[3988.62s -> 3989.98s]  Is that gonna fit?
[3989.98s -> 3990.82s]  Does that work?
[3990.82s -> 4001.61s]  Let's see, I think that fits, pretty sure at least.
[4001.61s -> 4003.66s]  Get that out of the way.
[4003.66s -> 4005.26s]  What's with the double screen?
[4005.26s -> 4010.14s]  That's weird.
[4010.14s -> 4016.06s]  Hmm, hold on a second, guys.
[4016.06s -> 4017.34s]  I'm gonna change this.
[4017.34s -> 4018.78s]  This is a little glitchy.
[4018.78s -> 4024.94s]  I'm just gonna add the screen region.
[4024.94s -> 4027.66s]  That should be better.
[4027.66s -> 4030.71s]  Okay, yeah, there we go.
[4030.71s -> 4038.18s]  All right, so that should be better.
[4038.18s -> 4043.34s]  All right, so I think we're gonna get some people in here
[4043.34s -> 4048.98s]  talk while we play.
[4049.02s -> 4051.85s]  Those of you that have never played this game,
[4051.85s -> 4055.48s]  please, my goodness, please go download it.
[4055.48s -> 4059.42s]  It is an unbelievable game, and it's free.
[4059.42s -> 4062.62s]  What other reason do you need?
[4062.62s -> 4070.84s]  Move this, it's not in the way.
[4070.84s -> 4075.19s]  To the left, to the left, to the right, to the right.
[4075.19s -> 4085.63s]  It needs to be moved a little bit.
[4085.63s -> 4089.63s]  All right, looks like it's centered,
[4089.63s -> 4095.29s]  at least on my screen.
[4095.29s -> 4100.37s]  So are we gonna get anybody in this call?
[4100.37s -> 4107.09s]  Maybe, what happened to the audio?
[4107.09s -> 4108.86s]  Audio's still here?
[4108.86s -> 4111.89s]  Yeah, it's here, I can hear it.
[4111.89s -> 4114.61s]  All right, somebody call me on Skype
[4114.61s -> 4116.49s]  so we can start a call.
[4116.49s -> 4119.52s]  Boo, or Stealth, or Burger Boy,
[4119.52s -> 4123.29s]  whichever one of you guys wants to do this thing,
[4123.29s -> 4125.25s]  and then just join off being home.
[4125.25s -> 4126.81s]  They might have already been calling.
[4126.81s -> 4130.06s]  Yeah, they are.
[4130.06s -> 4130.90s]  What up?
[4130.90s -> 4133.12s]  Oh, what's up, Burger Boy?
[4133.12s -> 4134.72s]  Oh, Burger Boy, now Burger Boy's calling me.
[4134.72s -> 4135.72s]  Get outta here.
[4135.72s -> 4138.56s]  Oh, I'm inviting them this one.
[4138.56s -> 4139.68s]  Is Boo around?
[4139.68s -> 4141.88s]  I was first.
[4141.88s -> 4144.20s]  What about, where's Italics?
[4144.20s -> 4145.20s]  Maybe Italics will play.
[4145.20s -> 4146.04s]  Boo's offline.
[4146.04s -> 4147.52s]  He might be doing a band thing right now.
[4147.52s -> 4148.94s]  Oh, hey, everyone.
[4148.94s -> 4153.65s]  Oh, what's up, Burger Boy?
[4153.65s -> 4154.49s]  Make sure you guys are turning up.
[4154.49s -> 4158.41s]  Oh, I was trying to stream off the game.
[4159.05s -> 4160.33s]  If somebody else wants to join,
[4160.33s -> 4162.45s]  can you guys monitor, or Stealth, can you monitor,
[4162.45s -> 4164.86s]  just in case I'm in the game?
[4164.86s -> 4165.70s]  Yeah, do it.
[4165.70s -> 4166.78s]  What's happening?
[4166.78s -> 4169.62s]  I'm just saying, when I alt tab in a window,
[4169.62s -> 4172.25s]  it just like explodes,
[4172.25s -> 4177.41s]  so I can't really alt tab anymore.
[4177.41s -> 4179.01s]  But I wanna play the game.
[4179.01s -> 4180.05s]  I mean, you could play the game,
[4180.05s -> 4182.61s]  just every 10 seconds, just check this.
[4186.19s -> 4188.07s]  So if you want, it's gonna be difficult
[4188.07s -> 4189.71s]  to join the game off me right now,
[4189.71s -> 4193.06s]  because the way this game works is you have to have,
[4193.06s -> 4194.38s]  I don't know how many friends you can have
[4194.42s -> 4197.08s]  to be honest, I really don't know.
[4197.08s -> 4201.03s]  But I'm gonna go Pathfinder.
[4201.03s -> 4202.52s]  I'm gonna turn this up.
[4202.52s -> 4204.43s]  Stream is under control.
[4204.43s -> 4206.16s]  No one's spamming you.
[4206.16s -> 4209.37s]  Stream is under control, and I gotta turn this up.
[4209.37s -> 4212.05s]  Turn this up.
[4212.05s -> 4213.01s]  Can't hear it.
[4213.01s -> 4213.85s]  All right, I think we're good.
[4213.85s -> 4216.13s]  Boo's still with sound on the stream?
[4216.13s -> 4217.46s]  Should be.
[4217.46s -> 4219.30s]  Hey, Burger Boy, do you have frogs in the sun?
[4219.30s -> 4221.98s]  Oh, he's got it.
[4221.98s -> 4223.74s]  He's absolutely got it.
[4223.74s -> 4225.62s]  So this game, if you don't know what this is,
[4225.62s -> 4229.00s]  if you're like, what the hell are you doing right now?
[4229.00s -> 4230.56s]  This game is pretty much,
[4230.56s -> 4235.52s]  think of Team Fortress meets Quake meets skiing
[4235.52s -> 4240.10s]  meets ski free meets Windows 95 meets Windows 98.
[4240.10s -> 4241.26s]  I'm not sure if that made any sense,
[4241.26s -> 4244.48s]  but this game is just, look at this, it's just chaos.
[4244.48s -> 4246.84s]  Pretty much think of this game as you play as a soldier,
[4246.84s -> 4248.28s]  like a Liberty Launcher soldier,
[4248.28s -> 4251.07s]  and that's pretty much what everyone is using.
[4251.07s -> 4252.99s]  Then you ski around like 100 miles per hour,
[4252.99s -> 4254.78s]  it's all about momentum,
[4254.78s -> 4258.34s]  and we just apparently won the game.
[4258.34s -> 4259.30s]  Yeah, that's a good way to put it.
[4259.30s -> 4261.10s]  This game is Halo with speed hacks
[4261.10s -> 4267.54s]  and cooler mechanics, in my opinion.
[4267.54s -> 4274.90s]  The music is cool.
[4274.90s -> 4277.88s]  I agree with what Jarvis said.
[4277.88s -> 4279.66s]  All right, let's change.
[4280.06s -> 4284.45s]  You go to a new map, but it's not really Halo.
[4284.45s -> 4288.71s]  It's like a, it's cooler than Halo, in my opinion,
[4288.71s -> 4291.31s]  just because I never really played Halo, so.
[4291.31s -> 4293.99s]  Because you never had an Xbox, you never could play.
[4293.99s -> 4296.98s]  I had an Xbox, I had a 360.
[4296.98s -> 4298.83s]  When?
[4302.53s -> 4305.86s]  Two or three years ago was the last time I had one.
[4305.86s -> 4306.70s]  Oh, what's going on?
[4306.70s -> 4309.64s]  Why am I like stuck here?
[4309.64s -> 4313.54s]  I'm like stuck in this like lobby area.
[4313.54s -> 4317.76s]  There we go.
[4317.76s -> 4320.64s]  So it was lagging right there, screen was lagging.
[4320.64s -> 4328.10s]  You kidding me?
[4328.10s -> 4330.15s]  Let me know if it keeps happening, guys.
[4330.15s -> 4333.66s]  Try this again.
[4333.74s -> 4337.60s]  Because if it keeps happening, I might restart it.
[4337.60s -> 4344.12s]  Just change a couple settings.
[4344.12s -> 4345.48s]  But yeah, once you get like, on a,
[4345.48s -> 4346.72s]  this game is so satisfying.
[4346.72s -> 4349.94s]  I'm going Blood Eagle, by the way.
[4349.94s -> 4353.11s]  You can get some real satisfying kills within this game.
[4353.11s -> 4354.87s]  Especially because it's all about long range,
[4354.87s -> 4357.18s]  just long ranging people, it's awesome.
[4357.18s -> 4358.86s]  Oh, did you quit and join a different game?
[4358.86s -> 4362.36s]  I did, just join off me.
[4362.36s -> 4364.63s]  Oh, come on.
[4364.63s -> 4367.55s]  Yeah, it like, kicks me out.
[4367.55s -> 4371.94s]  Oh, sure it did.
[4371.94s -> 4372.78s]  No!
[4372.78s -> 4374.99s]  It took so long to key up.
[4374.99s -> 4378.33s]  Because Burger Boy is like, not allowed to play.
[4378.33s -> 4379.49s]  How do I not kill that guy?
[4379.49s -> 4381.34s]  Here we go.
[4381.34s -> 4388.97s]  This is a beta, this is a beta.
[4390.73s -> 4392.70s]  Here's another kill.
[4392.70s -> 4393.82s]  It's free though, it's open.
[4393.82s -> 4395.16s]  Open beta.
[4395.16s -> 4396.00s]  Oh, he was in the air.
[4396.00s -> 4397.08s]  Why didn't you probably order a zerg shooter
[4397.08s -> 4403.14s]  and get that free crit?
[4403.14s -> 4404.30s]  You get three shots.
[4404.30s -> 4406.46s]  Pretty much, the path finders like the scout,
[4406.46s -> 4407.58s]  you move around really fast,
[4407.58s -> 4413.56s]  and soldiers like the soldier, I guess.
[4413.56s -> 4415.40s]  There's like, I think, nine classes in this game.
[4415.40s -> 4417.00s]  I'm pretty sure there is.
[4417.00s -> 4418.60s]  This is just team deathmatch.
[4418.60s -> 4423.69s]  And essentially, what the, why do we, what the hell?
[4423.69s -> 4428.45s]  I keep joining a game, we keep just winning.
[4428.45s -> 4429.29s]  Don't go home.
[4429.29s -> 4430.13s]  Don't quit.
[4430.13s -> 4431.13s]  All right, do not quit this one.
[4431.13s -> 4436.87s]  Keep staying, stay in this one.
[4436.91s -> 4442.13s]  Down, down.
[4442.13s -> 4447.60s]  But you see this up here, this 2700 XP.
[4447.60s -> 4450.27s]  Pretty much, if you don't wanna buy the game,
[4450.27s -> 4451.73s]  the game doesn't cost any money,
[4451.73s -> 4452.97s]  but it's kinda like in Team Fortress
[4452.97s -> 4456.49s]  where there's an economy where you can buy items
[4456.49s -> 4458.21s]  if you don't wanna wait and unlock them.
[4458.21s -> 4459.78s]  It's kinda like that.
[4459.78s -> 4461.80s]  So if you wanna spend money, you can,
[4461.80s -> 4463.90s]  but if you don't, it takes a long time
[4463.90s -> 4467.42s]  to get all the items and all the classes and everything, so.
[4467.42s -> 4471.10s]  And it's like an exaggerated long time.
[4471.10s -> 4473.14s]  Yeah.
[4473.18s -> 4477.51s]  Like 90 hours of game time to unlock a new class.
[4477.51s -> 4479.55s]  Yeah, you start with three classes
[4479.55s -> 4482.36s]  when you just get the game free.
[4482.36s -> 4486.60s]  You can spend 10, 20 bucks and you'll unlock everything,
[4486.60s -> 4487.44s]  pretty much.
[4487.44s -> 4488.26s]  What's gonna go in German?
[4488.26s -> 4493.83s]  I'm gonna go Blood Eagle, Pathfinder again.
[4493.83s -> 4495.47s]  I'm gonna turn the graphics down a tiny bit
[4495.47s -> 4497.41s]  just because I think people were saying it was lagging.
[4497.41s -> 4499.86s]  Burger Boy, you went on the other team.
[4499.86s -> 4500.70s]  Oh, Burger Boy.
[4500.70s -> 4504.79s]  What?
[4504.79s -> 4507.43s]  Oh, how do I switch teams in this game?
[4507.43s -> 4508.55s]  Did you just press escape?
[4508.55s -> 4512.90s]  Yeah, you're gonna escape and then switch teams?
[4512.90s -> 4514.98s]  Oh, this guy's toast down here.
[4515.02s -> 4517.06s]  This guy's toast, guys.
[4517.06s -> 4524.27s]  Oh, get him!
[4524.27s -> 4525.54s]  Right shot.
[4525.54s -> 4530.75s]  And let's just do it off.
[4530.75s -> 4531.59s]  There it is.
[4531.59s -> 4535.93s]  All right, so as you can see, I got a shotgun.
[4535.93s -> 4537.01s]  You pretty much only have two weapons.
[4537.01s -> 4538.97s]  I have grenades, too, but I don't really use them.
[4538.97s -> 4543.23s]  I mean, I know I should, but.
[4543.23s -> 4547.19s]  And see the top, the middle top, 97, 92?
[4547.19s -> 4549.15s]  This is team deathmatch, and essentially how this works
[4549.15s -> 4551.39s]  is when you die, one point gets taken off
[4551.39s -> 4554.95s]  your side of the team, but if your team has the flag,
[4554.95s -> 4557.77s]  or if their team has the flag, kills count as two.
[4557.77s -> 4560.25s]  So we have the flag right now, so any time we kill somebody
[4560.29s -> 4561.97s]  on their team, it's gonna count as two points
[4561.97s -> 4564.39s]  taken down from their score.
[4564.39s -> 4569.58s]  Oh, I just got nailed.
[4569.58s -> 4571.47s]  So it's lagging, huh?
[4571.47s -> 4573.59s]  No, let me see what the hell's going on here.
[4573.59s -> 4575.27s]  Wasn't doing this on Team Fortress, was it?
[4575.27s -> 4576.48s]  No, it wasn't.
[4576.48s -> 4578.52s]  Let's find out what the hell is going on.
[4578.52s -> 4581.31s]  It's too graphic with a management string.
[4581.31s -> 4582.93s]  No, that's my flag.
[4582.93s -> 4586.18s]  Shouldn't be.
[4586.18s -> 4587.02s]  I'm watching.
[4587.02s -> 4588.86s]  By the way, are you still on the terrorist thing?
[4588.86s -> 4589.70s]  Yeah.
[4589.70s -> 4590.86s]  Oh, you're still on CT?
[4590.86s -> 4593.42s]  Oh yeah, I got the flag, come get me.
[4593.42s -> 4594.84s]  Okay.
[4594.84s -> 4597.88s]  Oh, you're on the enemy team, huh?
[4597.88s -> 4600.00s]  Come get me, okay.
[4601.35s -> 4604.26s]  Destroyed.
[4604.26s -> 4610.76s]  Oh, come on, let's go 1v1, baby.
[4610.76s -> 4615.07s]  Oh, I got me, damn, got me.
[4615.07s -> 4616.43s]  It looks okay on my end.
[4616.43s -> 4620.04s]  When I'm watching the stream right now, it looks okay.
[4620.04s -> 4622.20s]  Maybe it was just like a little issue, I don't know,
[4622.20s -> 4633.14s]  not sure, but yeah.
[4633.14s -> 4635.14s]  Look at all those people in that.
[4635.14s -> 4641.83s]  Oh, I could play a sniper rifle.
[4641.83s -> 4642.75s]  Yeah, but see, when you go down,
[4642.75s -> 4644.35s]  look at the left and right of my screen.
[4644.35s -> 4646.01s]  See how I have that like power meter,
[4646.01s -> 4648.47s]  that's how fast I'm going when I ski.
[4648.47s -> 4650.87s]  The entire time you're gonna be holding down space,
[4650.87s -> 4651.83s]  essentially, in this game.
[4651.83s -> 4653.35s]  There's the flag.
[4653.35s -> 4654.19s]  All right.
[4654.63s -> 4657.83s]  Time to pull off something.
[4657.83s -> 4665.96s]  Oh, get him with an air shot, come on now.
[4665.96s -> 4670.54s]  I didn't get that guy.
[4670.54s -> 4673.54s]  Oh, killed people, go with people going for the flag.
[4673.54s -> 4676.47s]  You gotta get rid of these people, there we go.
[4676.47s -> 4678.03s]  All right, pick up the flag, pick up the flag.
[4678.03s -> 4680.37s]  I got it, I got it.
[4680.37s -> 4682.82s]  Oh, protect me.
[4682.82s -> 4684.92s]  Oh, Italics is in this game.
[4684.92s -> 4686.24s]  Drag him in the call.
[4686.24s -> 4687.08s]  Requisite?
[4687.08s -> 4689.95s]  Yeah.
[4689.95s -> 4690.79s]  Idiot drama.
[4690.79s -> 4691.63s]  Drag Italics in here.
[4691.63s -> 4692.47s]  Oh!
[4693.79s -> 4694.63s]  That was you?
[4694.63s -> 4695.71s]  I'm not impressed with him.
[4695.71s -> 4698.44s]  Oh, well, why aren't you not impressed with him?
[4698.44s -> 4702.94s]  Italics just blew me to hell, and I blew him to hell.
[4703.94s -> 4709.24s]  There we go.
[4709.24s -> 4712.62s]  Look at all these people right here.
[4712.62s -> 4714.26s]  Grenade, grenade.
[4714.26s -> 4720.90s]  Grenades are whack in this game.
[4720.90s -> 4721.74s]  Oh, there's a flag.
[4721.74s -> 4722.70s]  Give me the flag, where am I?
[4722.70s -> 4725.22s]  No, that was a snipe flag right there.
[4725.22s -> 4727.65s]  I just totally sniped that flag.
[4727.65s -> 4729.38s]  Oh, I'm losing momentum.
[4729.38s -> 4735.70s]  Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go.
[4735.70s -> 4739.82s]  I tried to Sentinel before, but I'm not very good at it.
[4739.82s -> 4746.54s]  God, I'm being chased by like a mob of people.
[4748.93s -> 4751.29s]  Well, press Z and all the people will start following you.
[4751.29s -> 4752.99s]  What?
[4752.99s -> 4753.83s]  I promise.
[4753.83s -> 4754.95s]  Yeah, because I'm gonna drop the flag.
[4754.95s -> 4759.48s]  Still got it.
[4759.68s -> 4761.76s]  Oh, maybe not anymore.
[4761.76s -> 4762.80s]  Protect me, stealth.
[4764.48s -> 4766.40s]  Oh, they got me.
[4766.40s -> 4770.28s]  Let me drag its Alex under here.
[4770.28s -> 4779.36s]  All right, he's coming.
[4779.36s -> 4780.44s]  There it is.
[4780.44s -> 4781.28s]  One more of those.
[4781.28s -> 4782.36s]  Yeah, baby.
[4782.36s -> 4783.20s]  You can get that flag.
[4783.20s -> 4784.79s]  One more of those.
[4784.79s -> 4787.93s]  Oh, one more of those, baby.
[4787.93s -> 4790.18s]  Hey, guys, what is going on?
[4790.18s -> 4791.19s]  What's up, man?
[4791.19s -> 4792.03s]  What's up, Alex?
[4792.03s -> 4793.67s]  Playing the flag, man, like I do.
[4797.52s -> 4799.76s]  Yeah, we got some good flag control.
[4799.76s -> 4801.64s]  Too bad, like, Burger Boy's terrible at this game.
[4801.64s -> 4803.96s]  He could really do something right now.
[4805.44s -> 4807.92s]  Can't even figure out how to switch teams.
[4809.60s -> 4810.96s]  It hit a scheme.
[4810.96s -> 4812.28s]  It did, and then what?
[4812.28s -> 4815.16s]  And then go to change...
[4815.16s -> 4816.00s]  And then you press,
[4816.00s -> 4818.43s]  I don't wanna be on this team anymore.
[4818.43s -> 4821.39s]  Oh, I think the MLC stealth just lied to you.
[4821.39s -> 4823.03s]  Yeah.
[4823.03s -> 4824.23s]  No, that's absolutely true.
[4824.23s -> 4825.27s]  I just did it.
[4825.27s -> 4827.13s]  Oh, wait, you pressed P.
[4827.13s -> 4827.97s]  Awesome.
[4827.97s -> 4828.81s]  That's what I meant to say.
[4828.81s -> 4831.09s]  Okay, good.
[4831.09s -> 4835.76s]  Oh, I can't, there's not enough people on that team.
[4835.76s -> 4837.92s]  Oh, this guy is so toast right now.
[4837.92s -> 4838.84s]  Oh, here we go.
[4839.52s -> 4840.76s]  Well, I can't switch.
[4840.76s -> 4848.12s]  Come on, get him with those shots.
[4848.12s -> 4853.14s]  Oh, fine, whatever, I'll go with this thing.
[4853.14s -> 4856.26s]  There's just a swarm of red upside down triangles
[4856.26s -> 4857.58s]  around that flag.
[4857.58s -> 4858.98s]  Oh, stealth, you got the flag, all right.
[4858.98s -> 4860.14s]  I sure do.
[4860.14s -> 4866.88s]  All right, let's do a little bit of teamwork here.
[4866.88s -> 4868.60s]  I'm a pro skier, watch how I go.
[4868.60s -> 4870.40s]  Yeah, if we're still playing already,
[4870.40s -> 4873.22s]  definitely, I'll get you in here.
[4873.22s -> 4874.58s]  Oh, there's Burger Boy.
[4874.58s -> 4877.22s]  Oh, Burger Boy.
[4877.22s -> 4878.38s]  Where are you?
[4878.38s -> 4879.86s]  Oh, right there, huh?
[4879.86s -> 4886.11s]  Oh, Burger Boy.
[4886.11s -> 4887.75s]  I'll switch here.
[4888.55s -> 4890.39s]  I think the teams are even.
[4890.39s -> 4892.70s]  Oh, no, no, yeah, you're, no, you didn't, not yet.
[4892.70s -> 4895.10s]  It depends on the auto balance moves, I guess.
[4895.10s -> 4898.58s]  Yeah, well, this game's almost over.
[4898.58s -> 4900.22s]  We're almost going to lose.
[4901.06s -> 4902.98s]  Oh, but I have a flag, that's good.
[4902.98s -> 4903.82s]  That means we're gonna win.
[4903.82s -> 4904.78s]  All right, so do not die.
[4904.78s -> 4907.62s]  Nobody die and we might win.
[4907.62s -> 4908.58s]  No, we won't.
[4908.58s -> 4913.22s]  That's gonna be a long range.
[4913.22s -> 4916.15s]  I'm gonna get rid of this guy.
[4916.15s -> 4918.71s]  Then I'll see, you were flying around the map right now.
[4918.71s -> 4920.59s]  I've been chasing you for so long.
[4920.59s -> 4922.27s]  I'm dead.
[4922.27s -> 4923.79s]  Like shooting Burger Boy from behind,
[4923.79s -> 4925.51s]  he's just like right behind me.
[4926.71s -> 4929.66s]  Oh, watch out, Burger Boy's gonna take us all on.
[4929.66s -> 4931.22s]  Somebody took him out, I don't know who.
[4931.22s -> 4933.16s]  Got an assist.
[4933.16s -> 4935.60s]  Burger Boy.
[4935.60s -> 4937.40s]  I can't even catch up with stealth.
[4937.40s -> 4938.24s]  And I'm on his team.
[4938.24s -> 4940.57s]  I know, really, right?
[4940.57s -> 4943.40s]  Spams, rocket spams.
[4943.40s -> 4944.48s]  Oh, we lost.
[4944.48s -> 4945.84s]  All right, try and get on his team.
[4945.84s -> 4948.33s]  I'm out looking for phone.
[4948.33s -> 4951.49s]  Try and get on his team, Burger Boy, the insensitive one.
[4951.49s -> 4955.16s]  All right, let's see if any of us
[4955.16s -> 4956.80s]  made it into the MVP statistics.
[4956.80s -> 4958.26s]  No, we sure didn't.
[4958.26s -> 4962.38s]  Yeah, you got the MLC stealth flag held top accolade.
[4963.62s -> 4968.27s]  You got like a top medal, you didn't get a MVP.
[4968.27s -> 4973.27s]  Actually, you got two, you got two medals.
[4973.27s -> 4975.07s]  Flag held and flag killer.
[4976.27s -> 4977.27s]  Top accolades.
[4977.27s -> 4978.69s]  This thing is.
[4978.69s -> 4981.30s]  My most flag held medals is 41.
[4981.30s -> 4982.50s]  And that's because I got the flag
[4982.50s -> 4983.46s]  right when the game started
[4983.46s -> 4985.62s]  and I skied around for 10 minutes and didn't get hit.
[4985.62s -> 4986.46s]  Why am I?
[4986.46s -> 4987.30s]  I didn't kill anybody either.
[4987.30s -> 4990.18s]  Why am I not logged into my own stream right now?
[4990.18s -> 4993.39s]  I just typed something, how's that possible?
[4996.32s -> 4998.20s]  So it says, oh, playing Team Fortress 2
[4998.24s -> 5002.28s]  when I'm absolutely not.
[5002.28s -> 5004.04s]  People might believe you.
[5004.04s -> 5008.12s]  What are you doing, Blood Eagle?
[5008.12s -> 5011.48s]  Yeah, go right when you can.
[5011.48s -> 5013.88s]  Is that Burger Boy just like click spamming?
[5013.88s -> 5017.58s]  Yeah, I'm trying to get in that Blood Eagle.
[5017.58s -> 5019.06s]  Now's your best chance.
[5019.06s -> 5020.78s]  Oh no.
[5022.65s -> 5024.33s]  Are we gonna get split up here?
[5024.33s -> 5025.17s]  Click faster.
[5025.17s -> 5027.53s]  I think we might get split up here.
[5027.53s -> 5029.53s]  Whatever, I'll catch you guys.
[5029.53s -> 5031.41s]  Oh, I just made it.
[5031.41s -> 5035.60s]  Oh, Burger Boy.
[5035.60s -> 5036.76s]  You could have still got nine.
[5036.76s -> 5037.60s]  Oh, he does, yeah.
[5037.60s -> 5038.44s]  He just waited.
[5038.60s -> 5039.44s]  You made it?
[5039.44s -> 5042.57s]  Oh, you made it.
[5042.57s -> 5043.53s]  Yeah, enemy has a flag.
[5043.53s -> 5044.65s]  No, I gotta change this.
[5044.65s -> 5049.06s]  It's just to say I'm playing tribes.
[5049.06s -> 5054.33s]  Tribes descend, here we go.
[5054.33s -> 5057.93s]  Broadcast updated successfully.
[5057.93s -> 5060.63s]  Uh-oh, got the flag.
[5060.63s -> 5062.26s]  Probably not for long.
[5062.26s -> 5067.11s]  No, I'm gonna go soldier this time.
[5067.11s -> 5069.70s]  I think that's the best idea.
[5069.70s -> 5073.02s]  Wow, there is no one on my team over here at all.
[5073.02s -> 5075.58s]  Try and italics, they're all behind you though.
[5075.58s -> 5077.42s]  Oh man, nice air shot.
[5077.42s -> 5079.02s]  Oh, Burger Boy made it on my team.
[5079.02s -> 5079.90s]  Oh yeah.
[5079.90s -> 5082.16s]  Oh, Burger Boy made it, that's good.
[5082.16s -> 5083.44s]  All right, let's keep going.
[5084.28s -> 5089.41s]  I got killed by an arx buster, whatever that is.
[5089.41s -> 5092.54s]  It's probably stupid.
[5092.54s -> 5095.16s]  Oh, you bastard, what are you doing?
[5095.16s -> 5099.34s]  Oh, that was a sweep under the bridge flight right there.
[5099.34s -> 5103.20s]  Oh, you wanna go assault rifle on assault rifle or something?
[5103.20s -> 5104.83s]  Oh yeah.
[5104.83s -> 5109.14s]  Oh, this guy needs one hit and he's dead.
[5109.14s -> 5111.72s]  Oh, come on, fine, thump up.
[5111.72s -> 5116.80s]  There we go, there we go.
[5116.80s -> 5118.20s]  All right, who's got the flag gun?
[5118.20s -> 5119.92s]  Uh-oh, uh-oh, they're gonna catch me now.
[5119.92s -> 5123.52s]  I ran into the border of the edge of the map over here.
[5123.56s -> 5125.50s]  Do we get the flogged estimator flag?
[5125.50s -> 5126.34s]  Yeah, we do.
[5126.34s -> 5128.58s]  And italics has two evil men chasing him.
[5128.58s -> 5130.26s]  All right, let's get over there.
[5130.26s -> 5131.78s]  Got some ninjas flying around behind me
[5131.78s -> 5132.62s]  trying to kill me.
[5132.62s -> 5133.86s]  I feel one dude chasing it.
[5133.86s -> 5135.74s]  Oh, italics' voice is smooth.
[5135.74s -> 5137.31s]  It is.
[5137.31s -> 5138.27s]  Somebody just said that.
[5138.27s -> 5139.75s]  Smooth like an erection.
[5142.50s -> 5144.58s]  Hey, this is a PG-13 stream.
[5144.58s -> 5147.82s]  I was like, I don't even know what that meant.
[5147.82s -> 5151.18s]  I was about to ask.
[5151.18s -> 5154.58s]  Oh, air shot, no, that guy just got me.
[5154.58s -> 5157.30s]  This thing doesn't go very far, I forget that sometimes.
[5157.34s -> 5159.54s]  I'm just kind of doing my best on the map right now.
[5159.54s -> 5161.50s]  I'm doing a lapse right behind you.
[5161.50s -> 5162.70s]  John Lance, where is he?
[5162.70s -> 5163.54s]  Uh-oh, uh-oh.
[5163.54s -> 5164.38s]  Trying to go faster than this.
[5164.38s -> 5165.46s]  Oh, God.
[5165.46s -> 5170.06s]  Not enough jet pack.
[5170.06s -> 5172.16s]  I'm trying to prove I'm a better skier.
[5172.16s -> 5174.56s]  Well, the classes have a lot of impact on that as well.
[5174.56s -> 5175.40s]  We'll pass you.
[5175.40s -> 5176.44s]  I'm back on you.
[5176.44s -> 5178.28s]  Yeah, if you're like the fastest class.
[5178.28s -> 5179.12s]  What are you?
[5179.12s -> 5179.94s]  Oh, damn.
[5179.94s -> 5180.78s]  I am a raider.
[5180.78s -> 5181.62s]  Yeah, this is tribe system.
[5181.62s -> 5182.46s]  You've got somebody behind you,
[5182.46s -> 5185.22s]  so I'll slow down a little bit until I'm done.
[5185.22s -> 5187.38s]  That should, this game is the person that just asked.
[5187.38s -> 5190.45s]  This game is free, and it's in open beta.
[5190.45s -> 5191.74s]  You can just play it.
[5191.74s -> 5196.83s]  You can play it as much as you want, whenever you want,
[5196.83s -> 5200.41s]  and it's a game about skiing, momentum, and fun.
[5200.41s -> 5202.41s]  It's a ski simulation game.
[5202.41s -> 5203.55s]  Yes.
[5203.55s -> 5204.83s]  Oh, this guy's smart.
[5204.83s -> 5206.07s]  What do I do with a smart guy?
[5206.07s -> 5210.05s]  Wait till he lands.
[5210.05s -> 5211.45s]  I can't believe I've been carrying
[5211.45s -> 5212.85s]  the flag this entire time.
[5212.85s -> 5213.89s]  I really can't.
[5215.75s -> 5217.73s]  We're taking care of our team here.
[5217.73s -> 5219.76s]  Wow, son of a.
[5219.76s -> 5223.52s]  Uh-oh, are we gonna get to see
[5223.52s -> 5227.34s]  some real raw Burger Boy rage?
[5227.34s -> 5228.90s]  Remember, Burger Boy, you can't say any
[5228.90s -> 5231.02s]  like wicked, horrible swears.
[5232.14s -> 5239.02s]  Oh, I'm about to run into a wall.
[5239.02s -> 5240.06s]  Oh, I ran into a wall.
[5240.06s -> 5240.90s]  It's over.
[5241.86s -> 5243.74s]  I see you, John.
[5243.74s -> 5245.77s]  Up deck here.
[5245.77s -> 5247.25s]  This is the zombie's deck.
[5247.25s -> 5248.73s]  Oh, you wanna go with this?
[5248.73s -> 5249.73s]  Boom.
[5249.73s -> 5251.61s]  Oh, nice, nice, nice.
[5251.61s -> 5254.72s]  It was a good run.
[5254.72s -> 5257.21s]  Very nice, very nice.
[5257.21s -> 5259.06s]  Burger Boy's in first place.
[5259.06s -> 5260.66s]  Burger Boy, there you go.
[5260.66s -> 5261.50s]  Oh, yeah.
[5261.50s -> 5262.32s]  Somebody get that flag.
[5262.32s -> 5268.66s]  All right, one of our guys got the flag.
[5268.66s -> 5270.06s]  Gotta get better aim.
[5270.06s -> 5271.51s]  Come on, land.
[5271.51s -> 5272.51s]  Oh, I got no ammo on this thing.
[5272.51s -> 5276.34s]  What am I doing?
[5276.34s -> 5282.08s]  I gotta get to an ammo supply.
[5282.12s -> 5284.66s]  Not doing so well right this second.
[5284.66s -> 5288.38s]  No, that's not, not doing so hot right there.
[5288.38s -> 5290.23s]  I just granated myself.
[5291.81s -> 5293.65s]  I'm like, as fast as you move in this game,
[5293.65s -> 5296.35s]  that is nearly impossible.
[5296.35s -> 5297.19s]  Yeah, I know, right?
[5297.19s -> 5299.28s]  That's crazy.
[5299.28s -> 5300.92s]  I got that guy on the couple of shots.
[5300.92s -> 5306.44s]  All right, Zephack, give me some speed.
[5306.44s -> 5308.07s]  I'll get this guy.
[5308.07s -> 5308.91s]  I'll thump this guy.
[5308.91s -> 5310.59s]  Oh, Tumblr's better than Thumpus.
[5310.59s -> 5314.03s]  Tumblr's better than Thumpus.
[5314.03s -> 5315.19s]  No, not high enough.
[5315.19s -> 5316.19s]  Wait, the flag has dropped.
[5316.19s -> 5317.59s]  I had the flag on my back.
[5317.59s -> 5318.43s]  Get out of the tower.
[5318.43s -> 5319.25s]  I got it, I got it.
[5319.25s -> 5320.79s]  I blew that guy away from you guys, nice.
[5321.03s -> 5324.24s]  Protect the Taleks.
[5324.24s -> 5325.64s]  Or I could just like sit down here alone
[5325.64s -> 5330.27s]  by myself like an idiot.
[5330.27s -> 5333.51s]  Awesome, what are you doing?
[5333.51s -> 5336.56s]  Oh, I just got air shot.
[5336.56s -> 5339.56s]  Damn.
[5339.56s -> 5342.86s]  Oh, losing momentum here.
[5342.86s -> 5346.14s]  Just got mad air shot.
[5346.14s -> 5348.48s]  I'm dead.
[5348.48s -> 5350.87s]  I don't know how I dropped these.
[5350.87s -> 5352.39s]  I see a flag, it's mine.
[5352.39s -> 5354.46s]  Well, we're doing.
[5354.46s -> 5356.14s]  I believe there are some grenades
[5356.14s -> 5358.86s]  that can make you drop stuff, like the flag.
[5358.86s -> 5360.77s]  Well, that's lame.
[5360.77s -> 5361.65s]  Actually, that's pretty cool.
[5361.65s -> 5364.06s]  Land on that.
[5364.06s -> 5365.14s]  I gotta get more, I gotta.
[5365.14s -> 5368.83s]  Oh, this guy's done.
[5369.91s -> 5372.48s]  Get out of town.
[5380.64s -> 5382.52s]  Just got killed by a blue fatty.
[5382.52s -> 5384.71s]  Somebody just said.
[5384.71s -> 5389.49s]  Juggernaut, yeah, that's a juggernaut probably.
[5389.49s -> 5391.21s]  I might wanna pull out the.
[5391.21s -> 5392.13s]  No, I might kill him.
[5392.13s -> 5393.05s]  One more shot, come on.
[5393.05s -> 5395.38s]  This is the one, this is the one right here.
[5395.38s -> 5396.62s]  Oh, no, he's not dead.
[5398.24s -> 5400.02s]  There we go.
[5400.02s -> 5404.37s]  I need to go to resupply big time.
[5404.37s -> 5405.49s]  Oh, Shibby's got a new video.
[5405.49s -> 5406.92s]  Reserve shooter.
[5406.92s -> 5407.76s]  Sick.
[5407.76s -> 5412.25s]  It's like a challenge based on your video.
[5412.25s -> 5414.17s]  Oh yeah, flag down baby.
[5414.17s -> 5420.40s]  Shibay.
[5420.40s -> 5421.92s]  All right, we're beating them by like,
[5421.92s -> 5424.90s]  we have like a 100% lead on them right now.
[5429.76s -> 5431.80s]  This guy off.
[5431.80s -> 5435.34s]  Trying to get like hit markers on him.
[5435.34s -> 5441.38s]  But man, I tell you right now, this game is a lot of fun.
[5441.38s -> 5443.02s]  I probably wouldn't have even started playing this game
[5443.02s -> 5445.09s]  if it was not for italics.
[5445.09s -> 5446.41s]  Thank you, sir, thank you.
[5446.41s -> 5448.37s]  I was like, you've got to play this game.
[5448.37s -> 5450.32s]  You're like, eh, whatever.
[5450.32s -> 5452.08s]  I was like, I'll give it a try, whatever.
[5452.08s -> 5454.08s]  It probably sucks, no.
[5454.08s -> 5457.58s]  This game is very, very good.
[5457.58s -> 5459.06s]  I saw it before a long time ago,
[5459.06s -> 5460.58s]  like months ago when people were first
[5460.58s -> 5462.11s]  starting talking about it.
[5462.11s -> 5463.75s]  And I was like, eh, it looks okay,
[5463.75s -> 5467.38s]  but this game is very addicting and very fun.
[5467.38s -> 5469.82s]  Somebody's behind me, but I don't care to turn around.
[5469.82s -> 5470.74s]  And it's free.
[5470.74s -> 5472.53s]  Yeah.
[5472.53s -> 5474.53s]  That's a huge plus right there.
[5474.53s -> 5477.33s]  I usually don't buy games that are like 10 bucks, so.
[5479.46s -> 5481.42s]  Yeah, Burger Boy doesn't buy video games
[5481.42s -> 5483.66s]  until they are $10.
[5483.66s -> 5485.34s]  And we're talking like Skyrim,
[5485.34s -> 5487.18s]  but it's like Sky, dude, you're never gonna get that game.
[5487.18s -> 5488.78s]  Oh, I'm not gonna get Skyrim three years from now.
[5488.78s -> 5491.32s]  Yeah, yeah, you're gonna get Skyrim
[5491.32s -> 5493.58s]  when you're like 35.
[5493.58s -> 5496.21s]  10 bucks yet?
[5496.21s -> 5498.62s]  Is it 10 bucks yet?
[5498.62s -> 5500.54s]  That's always, that's the Burger Boy quote.
[5500.54s -> 5501.66s]  I'll be like, oh, hey dude, you know,
[5501.74s -> 5503.56s]  Diablo 3 just came out.
[5503.56s -> 5504.82s]  10 bucks yet?
[5504.82s -> 5506.66s]  Like, no, it's not.
[5506.66s -> 5508.38s]  It's like 60.
[5508.38s -> 5513.06s]  Oh, well, I'm not blind until it's like 10 bucks.
[5513.06s -> 5515.48s]  I'm gonna try and help you with this dude.
[5515.48s -> 5516.68s]  Nice. Yep.
[5516.68s -> 5518.32s]  He was getting on you pretty good.
[5518.32s -> 5519.98s]  Yeah.
[5519.98s -> 5523.45s]  Agent 13, I thought.
[5523.45s -> 5524.93s]  Yeah, all right, let me know when...
[5524.93s -> 5527.33s]  All right, that was a joke, nobody was saved.
[5527.33s -> 5529.53s]  Wait, what did you just say?
[5529.53s -> 5532.22s]  I really just didn't even pay attention to a word you said.
[5532.22s -> 5533.68s]  Oh, I need to get up here.
[5533.68s -> 5534.52s]  I'm dead.
[5534.52s -> 5535.34s]  I'm so dead.
[5535.34s -> 5537.96s]  Yeah, absolutely.
[5537.96s -> 5539.30s]  Oh, top-fragging like a vile.
[5539.34s -> 5540.38s]  Got the guy for ya.
[5540.38s -> 5542.14s]  Got the guy for ya.
[5542.14s -> 5542.98s]  Nice.
[5544.96s -> 5547.24s]  Let's see if I can get a spike area with this airstrike.
[5547.24s -> 5549.13s]  Let's see if he walks right into it.
[5549.13s -> 5550.93s]  Oh, no, you almost got him.
[5550.93s -> 5552.05s]  He was in the air.
[5552.05s -> 5553.09s]  He was in the air.
[5553.09s -> 5557.92s]  At least it looked close from over here.
[5557.92s -> 5561.95s]  I'm trying to get him in the air.
[5561.95s -> 5564.86s]  Not shooting far enough ahead of him.
[5564.86s -> 5568.10s]  Nope, still not shooting far enough ahead of him.
[5568.10s -> 5569.42s]  Oh, that could have been an air shot.
[5569.42s -> 5571.44s]  Come on now.
[5571.44s -> 5573.23s]  Mother may I.
[5578.38s -> 5579.22s]  All right, I need to wait.
[5579.22s -> 5581.35s]  I gotta recharge my stuff here.
[5581.35s -> 5583.50s]  Oh, God.
[5583.54s -> 5587.46s]  Eat that, Margo.
[5587.46s -> 5588.74s]  Eat that, Vlad.
[5588.74s -> 5590.72s]  Here we go.
[5590.72s -> 5591.56s]  Victory.
[5591.56s -> 5593.86s]  Victory.
[5593.86s -> 5598.28s]  All right, let's get Ahri in here.
[5598.28s -> 5599.40s]  First one of the day.
[5599.40s -> 5600.24s]  Oh, no.
[5600.24s -> 5602.28s]  There he is.
[5602.28s -> 5605.04s]  Oh, Burger Boy with 12 kills, holy crap.
[5605.04s -> 5608.14s]  Did Burger Boy, nice.
[5608.14s -> 5610.38s]  I would not buy Team Fortress Classic.
[5610.38s -> 5614.54s]  The only reason why I say that is because it's just,
[5614.54s -> 5617.06s]  it's very, and now it's just so difficult to play.
[5617.06s -> 5620.61s]  This grenade spam is, it's,
[5620.61s -> 5622.85s]  unless it's like $5, don't buy it.
[5622.85s -> 5627.90s]  I'll put it that way.
[5627.90s -> 5629.63s]  Winner, winner, chicken dinner.
[5629.67s -> 5632.35s]  I think this is the first time I've ever gotten first place
[5632.35s -> 5634.47s]  in anything in tribes.
[5634.47s -> 5635.31s]  Oh, really?
[5635.31s -> 5638.26s]  In tribes.
[5638.26s -> 5640.82s]  That is an achievement in and of itself for me.
[5645.30s -> 5646.58s]  Not even first in the whole game.
[5646.58s -> 5647.66s]  Just first in my team.
[5647.66s -> 5648.50s]  That's good enough.
[5648.50s -> 5650.18s]  All right, quick, blood eagle.
[5650.18s -> 5651.02s]  Blood eagle.
[5651.02s -> 5652.06s]  Everybody click.
[5652.06s -> 5652.90s]  Click it.
[5653.86s -> 5655.26s]  Yes.
[5655.26s -> 5659.83s]  Go back to Pathfinder.
[5659.83s -> 5662.59s]  Oh, there's a guy right here.
[5662.59s -> 5663.94s]  Air shot, nope.
[5663.94s -> 5664.78s]  Get the first kill.
[5664.78s -> 5667.36s]  That gives you that flag, yeah.
[5667.36s -> 5668.57s]  It does?
[5668.57s -> 5669.41s]  Yep.
[5669.45s -> 5670.89s]  Oh, it's like Team Defender on Call of Duty?
[5670.89s -> 5672.83s]  You've never played Team Defender on Call of Duty?
[5672.83s -> 5677.12s]  Hey, watch it.
[5677.12s -> 5678.56s]  I can't believe that, oh, he's gonna kill me.
[5678.56s -> 5679.68s]  No, Germany, you have to get the first kill,
[5679.68s -> 5680.52s]  not first death.
[5680.52s -> 5683.48s]  I'm gonna be the first death if I don't get Lord Chaos.
[5683.48s -> 5685.82s]  I'm the first damn death.
[5685.82s -> 5688.61s]  Wow, that was the luckiest kill I've ever had.
[5688.61s -> 5690.86s]  Yeah, I'll probably do videos for tribes.
[5690.86s -> 5694.79s]  Eventually, I gotta get familiar with it, get good at it,
[5694.79s -> 5699.34s]  but I'll probably do a few videos, at least,
[5699.34s -> 5703.12s]  because this game is really awesome.
[5703.12s -> 5704.78s]  Boom.
[5704.78s -> 5705.90s]  The otter, boom, the otter.
[5705.90s -> 5706.74s]  Where am I?
[5706.74s -> 5710.66s]  I'm going the absolute wrong direction.
[5710.66s -> 5713.21s]  Gonna get some speed here.
[5713.25s -> 5716.18s]  Pickin' up speed, pickin' up speed.
[5716.18s -> 5718.79s]  Got him, and then someone got me.
[5718.79s -> 5720.43s]  Oh, we gotta get that flag.
[5720.43s -> 5722.79s]  You got it, somebody on our team got it.
[5722.79s -> 5724.39s]  MLC stealth is gonna die.
[5729.41s -> 5733.06s]  Look at that chaos, grenade into the chaos.
[5733.06s -> 5734.82s]  Oh, I thought I got that guy.
[5734.82s -> 5738.46s]  We're good, bye.
[5738.46s -> 5740.10s]  My game is just updating,
[5740.10s -> 5743.79s]  it's doing some really weird stuff right now.
[5743.79s -> 5745.87s]  Hey, when we installed it on Burger Boy's computer,
[5745.87s -> 5748.03s]  it was like all his fans turned on.
[5749.71s -> 5751.03s]  His computer almost like broke.
[5751.11s -> 5753.31s]  Explode, just randomly, I would be surprised.
[5754.64s -> 5756.84s]  That is like awesome computer I have.
[5756.84s -> 5757.68s]  Nice shot.
[5758.92s -> 5760.60s]  That guy got a really good shot.
[5760.60s -> 5762.88s]  We've had issues with Borderlands, Burger Boy.
[5762.88s -> 5765.22s]  We've had issues.
[5765.22s -> 5767.77s]  Burger Boy, Borderlands.
[5767.77s -> 5769.81s]  So Ari, how many times have you heard Burger Boy
[5769.81s -> 5772.61s]  swear and say horrible things in Borderlands?
[5772.61s -> 5774.45s]  Oh, oh God.
[5774.45s -> 5777.89s]  Basically, he did remap his keys for his special ability,
[5777.89s -> 5779.57s]  and every time he wanted to pick up an item,
[5779.57s -> 5781.77s]  he decided to activate his special ability.
[5783.57s -> 5784.69s]  And playing his break,
[5784.69s -> 5786.45s]  he was just screaming constantly
[5786.45s -> 5789.21s]  for the entire three hours that we played at a time.
[5791.30s -> 5792.54s]  Worst tank ever.
[5792.54s -> 5794.62s]  Oh, Burger Boy, come on.
[5794.62s -> 5800.85s]  You can like do better than that.
[5800.85s -> 5801.69s]  Oh, let's go, Shottie.
[5801.69s -> 5804.44s]  I don't have any momentum.
[5804.44s -> 5809.29s]  I'm like walking around the map.
[5809.29s -> 5810.13s]  Oh, I still have.
[5810.13s -> 5812.70s]  Hey, you.
[5812.70s -> 5815.06s]  I'm gonna waste this grenade.
[5815.06s -> 5820.19s]  Let's get this guy, double team.
[5820.19s -> 5824.31s]  Oh, I missed, there we go.
[5824.31s -> 5828.76s]  Another guy right there.
[5828.76s -> 5834.74s]  Two guys, 770, that's a direct shot.
[5834.78s -> 5836.54s]  Oh, that guy fell in the lava.
[5836.54s -> 5838.94s]  Oh, this guy, oh, he knew it.
[5838.94s -> 5842.13s]  Wow, that was awesome.
[5842.13s -> 5843.53s]  Come here, flag boy.
[5843.53s -> 5845.69s]  Holy crap, that was awesome.
[5845.69s -> 5846.77s]  Yes.
[5846.77s -> 5848.37s]  I just tried to get a resupply,
[5848.37s -> 5850.49s]  and a guy threw a grenade right into my feet
[5850.49s -> 5853.52s]  when I went over there and got me.
[5853.52s -> 5867.22s]  Touche, my friend, that was great, woo.
[5867.22s -> 5869.97s]  So Jerma, what classes do you have unlocked so far?
[5869.97s -> 5872.71s]  Just the sniper sentinel.
[5872.71s -> 5873.55s]  That's it.
[5873.55s -> 5874.91s]  The nice thing about, like yesterday,
[5874.91s -> 5876.99s]  we were talking about the ones
[5876.99s -> 5878.79s]  that don't detonate on impact.
[5879.35s -> 5880.83s]  They bounce around.
[5880.83s -> 5882.23s]  I have the grenade launcher right now,
[5882.23s -> 5883.67s]  and I've noticed that if you get a direct hit,
[5883.67s -> 5884.71s]  it's like the demo man, you know,
[5884.71s -> 5886.43s]  it'll just explode, it'll just pop.
[5886.43s -> 5887.27s]  Oh, really?
[5887.27s -> 5888.93s]  Immediately.
[5888.93s -> 5889.77s]  Wow.
[5889.77s -> 5891.61s]  And the nice thing about them also
[5891.61s -> 5893.53s]  is that they usually do a lot more damage
[5893.53s -> 5897.31s]  and have a bigger radius than like the spin fuses.
[5897.31s -> 5899.71s]  Yeah, I've noticed the explosion's huge.
[5899.71s -> 5903.62s]  You just get a massive damage spike right there.
[5903.62s -> 5905.10s]  Going in the lava, I keep falling in the lava
[5905.10s -> 5908.86s]  like an idiot.
[5908.86s -> 5911.22s]  Hey, stop it.
[5911.22s -> 5913.71s]  I can't help it.
[5913.71s -> 5916.93s]  Does anybody else feel like they're playing Star Wars?
[5917.01s -> 5918.97s]  Or we are on like that map.
[5918.97s -> 5919.81s]  Yeah.
[5919.81s -> 5920.65s]  What's that map called?
[5920.65s -> 5921.49s]  I don't know.
[5921.49s -> 5923.68s]  I mean, even the noise is like the,
[5923.68s -> 5924.52s]  I feel like the,
[5924.52s -> 5929.14s]  it sounds like Star Wars.
[5929.14s -> 5930.70s]  Oh, dang it.
[5930.70s -> 5932.50s]  So what are you guys' favorite classes
[5932.50s -> 5933.34s]  with the game so far?
[5933.34s -> 5934.18s]  Pathfinder.
[5934.18s -> 5936.17s]  I like moving fast and having zero health.
[5936.17s -> 5937.53s]  Pathfinder.
[5937.53s -> 5941.86s]  Yeah, I'd probably say the Pathfinder too.
[5941.86s -> 5943.70s]  Just get the shock on a solid key.
[5943.70s -> 5945.58s]  Break the trend, break the trend.
[5945.58s -> 5948.54s]  I would say Raider or Infiltrator.
[5948.54s -> 5952.08s]  See, I don't even, I gotta get those guys.
[5952.08s -> 5953.48s]  I'm not very good with the Infiltrator yet.
[5953.48s -> 5958.66s]  Never been good with stealthy classes in any game.
[5958.66s -> 5960.46s]  But it's still fun.
[5960.46s -> 5962.68s]  Yeah, so you can cloak?
[5962.68s -> 5964.64s]  Oh yeah, you can cloak.
[5964.64s -> 5965.48s]  That's crazy.
[5965.48s -> 5967.60s]  And instead of using your energy for your jet pack,
[5967.60s -> 5969.00s]  it'll use it for your stealth.
[5969.00s -> 5971.04s]  Oh, okay, that's a good trade-off.
[5971.04s -> 5972.28s]  That's not like overpowered or anything.
[5972.28s -> 5973.62s]  That's cool.
[5973.62s -> 5975.54s]  And there's a few items and like perks.
[5975.54s -> 5976.38s]  Maybe not perks,
[5976.38s -> 5978.18s]  but I know there's at least one or two items
[5978.18s -> 5982.23s]  that can like detect stealth people.
[5982.23s -> 5983.07s]  Oh, really?
[5983.07s -> 5984.64s]  I don't have any of those yet.
[5984.64s -> 5985.68s]  There's a lot of people here.
[5985.68s -> 5986.52s]  I'm so dead.
[5986.52s -> 5993.62s]  Yeah, there's like 10 people around me.
[5993.62s -> 5995.38s]  Skate down here.
[5995.38s -> 6000.29s]  Oh, Tony Hawk presents Tribes Ascent.
[6000.29s -> 6003.32s]  Do a kickflip.
[6003.32s -> 6004.60s]  All right, I'm gonna do like a shaky 200,
[6004.60s -> 6008.18s]  oh, that's like 25 points.
[6008.18s -> 6010.49s]  All right, I gotta get some speed.
[6010.49s -> 6013.88s]  Yeah, I cannot catch up to the flag carrier.
[6013.88s -> 6015.60s]  Oh, shut down his screen.
[6015.60s -> 6017.59s]  I'll try and cut him off.
[6017.59s -> 6019.82s]  Hey, Burger Boy, your phone.
[6019.82s -> 6021.69s]  How did you know it was him?
[6021.69s -> 6024.98s]  How did you know he was right there?
[6024.98s -> 6028.28s]  Hey, call you right back, I'm gonna make a stream.
[6028.28s -> 6029.52s]  I know Jerma's ringtone,
[6029.52s -> 6031.60s]  and I'm pretty sure Burger Boy's the only one
[6031.60s -> 6034.80s]  who is gonna have his phone on him right now.
[6034.80s -> 6036.71s]  What if Vitalik's has his phone on him?
[6036.71s -> 6038.20s]  I don't think he would.
[6039.00s -> 6040.16s]  I thought that was more of a Burger Boy thing,
[6040.16s -> 6042.20s]  to have his phone on him.
[6042.20s -> 6043.80s]  What that means about you, I don't know.
[6043.80s -> 6045.08s]  Give me that, give me that.
[6045.08s -> 6048.19s]  Oh yeah, I got the flag.
[6048.19s -> 6049.64s]  Hey, we're losing.
[6049.64s -> 6051.90s]  Yeah, I got the flag, just protect me.
[6051.90s -> 6053.50s]  All right, I'll lay you off.
[6053.50s -> 6055.06s]  I'll do what I want, what I want.
[6055.06s -> 6056.34s]  Oh, I'm gonna lose speed right now.
[6056.34s -> 6058.14s]  I'm gonna be sitting ducking two seconds.
[6058.14s -> 6059.82s]  I'm gonna be your body shield.
[6062.15s -> 6065.47s]  Oh my God, there's a whole crew just following you.
[6065.47s -> 6067.08s]  Did I kill that guy?
[6067.08s -> 6070.91s]  Ah, finally, jeez.
[6070.91s -> 6072.03s]  Oh my God.
[6072.03s -> 6073.59s]  Oh yeah, I got one of them for you.
[6073.59s -> 6079.10s]  Oh, I'm dead, I gotta kill though.
[6080.02s -> 6083.06s]  I got another kill?
[6083.06s -> 6084.74s]  I think another planet died.
[6084.74s -> 6085.98s]  Oh, I'm gonna land right on top
[6085.98s -> 6088.40s]  of everybody that's right there.
[6088.40s -> 6090.61s]  Oh no, give me that flag.
[6090.61s -> 6093.23s]  Oh, I ran right by it.
[6093.23s -> 6096.03s]  Oh no, oh, that bastard got it.
[6096.03s -> 6101.32s]  No, no, give the shotgun up.
[6101.32s -> 6104.31s]  Oh, damn.
[6104.31s -> 6106.31s]  Shotgun, best weapon in this game.
[6106.31s -> 6107.63s]  Yeah, I didn't pull it out early enough.
[6107.63s -> 6110.02s]  I should have pulled it out way earlier.
[6110.02s -> 6111.46s]  Oh, Vitalik's don't die.
[6111.46s -> 6113.22s]  I got him, I got him, man.
[6113.22s -> 6114.44s]  Almost died.
[6114.44s -> 6117.90s]  I have 13 health.
[6117.90s -> 6120.26s]  My streak.
[6120.34s -> 6127.18s]  I don't see you destroying 16 kills, man.
[6127.18s -> 6128.74s]  I think I just blew that guy's grenade up
[6128.74s -> 6130.58s]  in midair in front of him.
[6130.58s -> 6133.42s]  I think that's actually what just happened.
[6133.42s -> 6134.54s]  Where is the flag?
[6134.54s -> 6136.15s]  I don't know, we don't have it though.
[6136.15s -> 6138.59s]  It's a pretty much, it's a pretty close game right now.
[6138.59s -> 6139.99s]  We can't lose this.
[6139.99s -> 6141.07s]  Melee kill.
[6141.07s -> 6144.11s]  Oh, I just totally stole that from you, Burger Boy.
[6144.11s -> 6149.10s]  Melee is so tough, but so satisfying when you get it.
[6149.10s -> 6153.06s]  I only do it like on AFK people, or like snipers.
[6153.06s -> 6153.90s]  Someone just asked.
[6153.90s -> 6154.74s]  Especially when you're an infiltrator.
[6154.74s -> 6157.82s]  Someone asked me, are there hats in this game?
[6158.86s -> 6160.02s]  I don't think so.
[6160.02s -> 6162.18s]  I wouldn't, don't put it past him, man.
[6162.18s -> 6167.19s]  This game could have a lot of items in the coming future.
[6167.19s -> 6168.91s]  He's got it with a freaking crossbow.
[6168.91s -> 6170.19s]  I got the flag guy.
[6170.19s -> 6172.23s]  All right, you got the flag?
[6172.23s -> 6173.31s]  We're gonna lose.
[6173.31s -> 6176.62s]  We're absolutely gonna lose.
[6176.62s -> 6178.38s]  Try and cut this flag guy off.
[6178.38s -> 6179.62s]  Yeah, we're gonna lose.
[6179.62s -> 6180.46s]  Oh, cut him off.
[6180.46s -> 6181.30s]  It's a done deal.
[6181.30s -> 6182.90s]  Cut him off.
[6182.90s -> 6185.26s]  It's not over yet, guys.
[6185.26s -> 6187.66s]  That guy's out of speed, that guy's out of speed.
[6187.66s -> 6189.90s]  Seven to 24, I think it's over.
[6189.90s -> 6190.74s]  Five.
[6191.90s -> 6193.37s]  Oh yeah.
[6194.01s -> 6195.49s]  Oh yeah, it's absolutely over.
[6195.49s -> 6197.13s]  Somebody call in the nuke.
[6197.13s -> 6199.21s]  Oh.
[6199.21s -> 6200.93s]  Wait, no, I had 10,000 credits,
[6200.93s -> 6202.81s]  but I called in an inventory station instead.
[6202.81s -> 6205.37s]  MLC has killed me 15 times in a row,
[6205.37s -> 6207.62s]  that's how many he's said.
[6207.62s -> 6210.59s]  Well, I feel like a retard.
[6210.59s -> 6211.79s]  I was supposed to call in an orbital strike,
[6211.79s -> 6212.99s]  but I called in the inventory station.
[6212.99s -> 6214.66s]  Sorry, does nobody die?
[6214.66s -> 6215.90s]  Give me that flag.
[6221.87s -> 6226.10s]  Oh, all right, I think probably one more round, maybe.
[6226.10s -> 6228.86s]  You guys wanna play CTF, or just keep doing this?
[6230.73s -> 6232.97s]  I don't know, CTF can be very, very long,
[6232.97s -> 6236.58s]  so I'm just supposed to do one more of this.
[6236.58s -> 6240.02s]  Are you in here yet, or are you game-loaded?
[6240.02s -> 6242.22s]  45 seconds, apparently.
[6243.58s -> 6245.14s]  He says 20 minutes ago.
[6247.58s -> 6248.62s]  Well, no worries, I mean.
[6248.62s -> 6251.54s]  I got this game when Beta first was announced for this.
[6251.54s -> 6253.18s]  I signed up for this, like this,
[6253.18s -> 6256.10s]  and Firefall I signed up for like years ago.
[6256.10s -> 6256.94s]  Yeah.
[6256.94s -> 6259.86s]  And Firefall is incredible.
[6259.86s -> 6261.30s]  I got the Beta for that as well.
[6261.86s -> 6262.94s]  I'm so jealous.
[6264.42s -> 6265.98s]  It's only two times a week, though.
[6265.98s -> 6267.78s]  You can only delve on in those two periods,
[6267.78s -> 6271.34s]  one for Europe and one for US, but it is insane.
[6271.34s -> 6273.38s]  It's looking like an incredible game
[6273.38s -> 6274.54s]  if you get a chance to get it.
[6274.54s -> 6277.41s]  What is Firefall, what is it?
[6277.41s -> 6279.85s]  It's another free-to-play game coming out,
[6279.85s -> 6282.17s]  and it was like the highlight,
[6282.17s -> 6284.65s]  one of the highlights of E3 the past year.
[6284.65s -> 6287.52s]  It's, how can you describe it?
[6287.52s -> 6289.42s]  How can you describe it, Alex?
[6289.42s -> 6290.68s]  What is it called?
[6290.68s -> 6291.52s]  Firefall.
[6291.56s -> 6293.44s]  Well, I thought someone said 5-4.
[6293.44s -> 6296.76s]  That's what I did just say.
[6296.76s -> 6297.60s]  Oh, okay.
[6297.60s -> 6298.80s]  Oh, when are you gonna get it?
[6298.80s -> 6299.64s]  5-4-3-2-1.
[6299.64s -> 6301.04s]  He's saying Fire as in it burns you,
[6301.04s -> 6304.40s]  and then Fall as in falling.
[6304.40s -> 6305.56s]  Sorry, the English accent,
[6305.56s -> 6307.56s]  but he's gonna come across great.
[6307.56s -> 6309.77s]  Well, no, I'm just an idiot, so.
[6309.77s -> 6311.45s]  Firefall is like, okay, imagine.
[6311.45s -> 6312.65s]  Oh, oh, Firefall.
[6312.65s -> 6315.81s]  We played that at Tax East last year.
[6315.81s -> 6318.21s]  Yeah, that's the one, yeah.
[6318.21s -> 6319.73s]  5-4-3-2-1.
[6320.44s -> 6324.91s]  It looks like Borderlands with an MMO,
[6324.91s -> 6329.07s]  and then open world, and then awesome art style.
[6329.07s -> 6331.83s]  It is, the art style is absolutely beautiful.
[6331.83s -> 6334.67s]  It's one of the most stunning games I've seen in beta.
[6334.67s -> 6337.29s]  Like, it looks good as it is.
[6337.29s -> 6340.00s]  Yeah, right, now that's cool.
[6340.00s -> 6341.48s]  Oh, this guy's gonna land on that.
[6341.48s -> 6343.33s]  No, he's not.
[6343.33s -> 6349.93s]  Oh, I'm getting blasted, come on.
[6349.93s -> 6352.06s]  Oh, yeah.
[6352.06s -> 6352.90s]  Oh, I'm actually a shooter.
[6352.90s -> 6354.74s]  Anybody else over here with me and the flag guy?
[6354.74s -> 6357.84s]  I'm going after this dude down here.
[6357.84s -> 6359.48s]  Flag, come on, do you need help?
[6360.28s -> 6364.26s]  I'm playing Juggernaut, I'm not good with Juggernaut.
[6364.26s -> 6372.59s]  I'm okay, I gotta get better with him.
[6372.59s -> 6375.42s]  Oh, come on, walk into that.
[6375.42s -> 6376.98s]  This guy is standing still.
[6376.98s -> 6381.82s]  Oh, I just got that guy mid-air with a grenade in his back.
[6381.82s -> 6383.14s]  Did anyone else do that?
[6383.14s -> 6385.58s]  Yeah, I did, I was watching him come out.
[6385.58s -> 6387.78s]  I was like 15 feet above the guy.
[6387.78s -> 6389.54s]  I just like looked in front of him
[6389.54s -> 6393.26s]  and just like popped the grenade right on his back,
[6393.26s -> 6394.80s]  and he dropped the flag.
[6394.80s -> 6397.61s]  That was amazing.
[6397.61s -> 6398.89s]  You gotta chase him right behind you, Tellix.
[6398.89s -> 6399.97s]  Oh, he's dead now.
[6399.97s -> 6402.82s]  Somebody behind me now, I think.
[6403.66s -> 6405.06s]  Is AFK guy?
[6405.06s -> 6405.90s]  Get him?
[6405.90s -> 6407.56s]  Oh, he's not AFK anymore, is he?
[6407.56s -> 6408.40s]  Oh, no, he's AFK.
[6408.40s -> 6409.24s]  Haley.
[6411.23s -> 6415.46s]  Oh boy, come on, land, land.
[6415.46s -> 6417.67s]  Oh, nice shot, dude.
[6421.18s -> 6423.06s]  It's like a ballet of death right there, Juggernaut.
[6423.06s -> 6424.85s]  Juggernaut, I'm being chased.
[6424.85s -> 6426.73s]  I'm dead, nothing I can do about it.
[6426.73s -> 6428.09s]  You're right next to me.
[6428.09s -> 6429.30s]  What?
[6429.30s -> 6431.14s]  Oh, well, where is he?
[6431.14s -> 6431.98s]  Oh, okay.
[6431.98s -> 6432.82s]  I need to add you guys to my friends list
[6432.82s -> 6433.66s]  so I can see you.
[6433.66s -> 6434.50s]  So we can see like names, I know.
[6434.50s -> 6437.18s]  Yeah.
[6437.18s -> 6440.38s]  I'm trying to get him to walk into this grenade.
[6440.38s -> 6443.08s]  Oh, he's going too fast.
[6443.16s -> 6444.00s]  Where'd he go?
[6444.00s -> 6445.46s]  I just launched him somewhere.
[6445.46s -> 6447.18s]  Great, where the hell is he?
[6447.18s -> 6448.02s]  Oh, of course.
[6448.02s -> 6448.86s]  He's right next to me.
[6448.86s -> 6450.95s]  You got like two people behind you, Juggernaut.
[6450.95s -> 6454.35s]  Yeah, I'm trying to go for the suppressing.
[6454.35s -> 6455.31s]  Oh, I'm stuck.
[6455.31s -> 6456.15s]  I'm stuck, I'm gonna die.
[6456.15s -> 6456.99s]  I'm so dead.
[6456.99s -> 6459.29s]  I'm like on the ground.
[6459.29s -> 6462.22s]  Nope, nope, you've still got it, you've still got it.
[6462.22s -> 6463.62s]  Oh, my God.
[6463.62s -> 6467.17s]  Oh, you just saved my life right there.
[6467.17s -> 6468.69s]  What's my graphics card?
[6468.69s -> 6474.68s]  I use a GTX 470 in video.
[6474.68s -> 6475.52s]  It's good.
[6475.52s -> 6476.36s]  I wouldn't really recommend,
[6476.36s -> 6477.52s]  if you're gonna get a new graphics card,
[6477.52s -> 6479.34s]  don't get the 400 series.
[6479.34s -> 6482.45s]  There's the 400 series, at least the 470 and the 480.
[6482.45s -> 6485.78s]  They heat up way too much.
[6485.78s -> 6487.14s]  They are not recommended.
[6487.14s -> 6489.52s]  They're very, they're good cards,
[6489.52s -> 6493.90s]  but they can get to be like 80, 90 degrees Celsius,
[6493.90s -> 6496.94s]  and it's not really that good for your computer.
[6502.18s -> 6504.82s]  York, I did play Global Agenda.
[6504.82s -> 6508.34s]  I have something like 700 hours,
[6508.34s -> 6510.02s]  I think, clocked in on that game.
[6510.02s -> 6511.58s]  On Global Agenda?
[6511.58s -> 6512.58s]  Yeah, oh God.
[6512.58s -> 6515.46s]  I used to play, both me and Zeus used to play
[6516.30s -> 6518.14s]  like seriously, like two years ago.
[6518.14s -> 6519.74s]  Global Agenda is a different path.
[6519.74s -> 6521.42s]  I thought you meant Global Offensive.
[6521.42s -> 6523.30s]  No, no, Global Agenda.
[6523.30s -> 6524.66s]  That was before it was free.
[6524.66s -> 6526.82s]  Like we bought it and we played it,
[6526.82s -> 6530.26s]  and oh God, like we put in hours into that game,
[6530.26s -> 6532.98s]  and then it all kind of went downhill after a while
[6532.98s -> 6533.82s]  when they went free,
[6533.82s -> 6535.94s]  and they built Tribes Ascent instead.
[6535.94s -> 6538.10s]  They took all their money out of Global Agenda
[6538.10s -> 6539.78s]  and put it into Tribes instead.
[6542.64s -> 6543.84s]  That's pretty, and that's cool.
[6543.84s -> 6544.68s]  What was Global Agenda?
[6544.68s -> 6546.44s]  Was it like a similar game?
[6547.83s -> 6549.51s]  Yeah, it was third person,
[6549.51s -> 6551.11s]  then you could also get into first person
[6551.11s -> 6553.39s]  when you aimed down sight and things like that.
[6553.39s -> 6554.99s]  It was a really good concept,
[6554.99s -> 6558.07s]  just it needed to be made by a bigger company,
[6558.07s -> 6559.15s]  if that makes sense.
[6559.15s -> 6561.64s]  Yeah, it does.
[6561.64s -> 6562.80s]  Like APB, I guess.
[6562.80s -> 6563.64s]  APB could have been.
[6563.64s -> 6565.61s]  Auto Balance, don't die.
[6565.61s -> 6567.17s]  Or I don't know how to treat it.
[6567.17s -> 6571.44s]  APB went into the crapper, didn't it?
[6571.44s -> 6573.40s]  Cause like they ran out of money or something?
[6573.40s -> 6575.64s]  Oh yeah, they were in so much debt in the end.
[6575.64s -> 6578.32s]  EA was just like, oh, free game, we'll buy you.
[6579.00s -> 6581.00s]  They just made it free for everybody.
[6581.00s -> 6582.76s]  It just went downhill from then on in.
[6582.76s -> 6585.46s]  Yeah, there is no health kit, by the way.
[6585.46s -> 6591.77s]  There is no health kits in this game.
[6591.77s -> 6598.25s]  Oh, shit, so.
[6598.25s -> 6600.45s]  I think we're gonna win, absolutely, by the way.
[6600.45s -> 6601.85s]  I've had the flag the entire game.
[6601.85s -> 6611.94s]  That guy's just been stumbling me with this fucking air shot.
[6611.94s -> 6612.78s]  That's a sniper coming at me.
[6612.78s -> 6616.59s]  Oh, that was beautiful.
[6616.59s -> 6619.58s]  Air walking shot, gorgeous.
[6619.58s -> 6623.82s]  Gorgeous, yeah, this guy's, let's get him.
[6623.82s -> 6624.66s]  There we go.
[6624.66s -> 6627.26s]  Nice, yeah buddy.
[6627.26s -> 6628.63s]  Oh, I got it.
[6628.63s -> 6630.42s]  If I don't need it, I just.
[6630.46s -> 6633.15s]  Oh, that was an air shot.
[6633.15s -> 6634.47s]  That was a pretty close air shot, though.
[6634.47s -> 6639.58s]  I don't know if I would really count that.
[6639.58s -> 6642.10s]  I have to get some more ammo and come back to fight.
[6642.10s -> 6644.69s]  Oh, I'll blow up.
[6644.69s -> 6646.58s]  I got a four core quad core.
[6646.58s -> 6654.11s]  Four cores.
[6657.42s -> 6664.51s]  Oh, that was interesting, I guess, what I just did.
[6664.51s -> 6666.33s]  The spin fuser.
[6666.33s -> 6668.93s]  Are you still carrying the flag, MLC?
[6668.93s -> 6670.21s]  Yeah, this guy just walked right,
[6670.21s -> 6671.61s]  he just like flew right by you.
[6671.61s -> 6672.45s]  He's like, eh, whatever.
[6672.45s -> 6674.37s]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna chase you.
[6674.37s -> 6677.30s]  Actually, I'm gonna come back to you.
[6677.30s -> 6678.14s]  Are you all right?
[6678.14s -> 6680.02s]  Are you dead or what are you doing still?
[6680.86s -> 6681.70s]  Just floating around the map.
[6681.70s -> 6684.30s]  Yeah, I've, probably my fourth map around the map.
[6684.30s -> 6688.82s]  Oh, you gotta do, oh, you got people on you now.
[6688.82s -> 6692.01s]  Oh, did they finally figure out how this game was played?
[6692.01s -> 6696.68s]  If I could not be such a slog, I would come over there.
[6696.68s -> 6698.40s]  Sorry, they're not gonna be able to catch me.
[6698.40s -> 6702.84s]  Juggernaut, why do you forsake me?
[6702.84s -> 6703.68s]  Oh, you're a juggernaut?
[6703.68s -> 6707.45s]  No wonder you can't keep up.
[6707.45s -> 6714.54s]  I'm pretty much like in molasses right now.
[6714.54s -> 6717.87s]  No, he's dead.
[6717.87s -> 6719.72s]  Oh, they're trying to snipe me.
[6719.72s -> 6723.11s]  Yeah, they got a couple of snipers, actually, to be honest.
[6723.15s -> 6725.77s]  All right, let's get some effing speed here.
[6730.01s -> 6731.66s]  Whoa, we're alive.
[6733.28s -> 6735.38s]  Oh, look at that slug.
[6735.38s -> 6738.05s]  Ah, I missed him.
[6738.05s -> 6740.18s]  I can't even go chase him either.
[6740.18s -> 6743.63s]  I'm like the heavy weapons guy.
[6743.63s -> 6745.58s]  No, that's your character in Sword War.
[6745.58s -> 6746.58s]  No, that's right.
[6748.06s -> 6749.30s]  Oh, I finally died.
[6749.30s -> 6750.94s]  Oh, am I actually gonna move more
[6750.94s -> 6754.14s]  than like two miles per hour now?
[6754.14s -> 6755.78s]  Oh, somebody else picked up the flag.
[6755.78s -> 6757.70s]  Oh, great, I'm going in the opposite direction
[6757.70s -> 6760.58s]  that everybody is.
[6760.58s -> 6762.34s]  All right, that's enough.
[6762.34s -> 6764.58s]  I'm changing the pathfinder.
[6765.54s -> 6768.59s]  Time to commit suicide.
[6768.59s -> 6771.84s]  That didn't even kill me.
[6771.84s -> 6772.68s]  Oh, what's that?
[6772.68s -> 6775.34s]  It's a big bouncing blue-green ball.
[6775.34s -> 6779.12s]  Oh, Burger Boy, is that you in the flying?
[6779.12s -> 6780.99s]  No, that's the quay.
[6780.99s -> 6782.35s]  Oh, so beautiful.
[6782.35s -> 6784.26s]  I'm going this way.
[6784.26s -> 6786.90s]  MLG Grandpa is on an off season right now.
[6786.90s -> 6792.85s]  He'll be back in probably a couple weeks, I'm assuming.
[6792.85s -> 6800.38s]  I'm gonna go help protect the flag carrier.
[6800.38s -> 6801.22s]  Woo-hoo!
[6805.31s -> 6806.75s]  Hey, if you hit one of those water guys
[6806.75s -> 6807.59s]  who's when they're going off,
[6807.59s -> 6810.14s]  it'll actually give you like a ton of air.
[6810.14s -> 6811.14s]  Really?
[6811.14s -> 6811.98s]  Yeah, I just got going.
[6811.98s -> 6812.80s]  I don't know if you see them,
[6812.88s -> 6815.32s]  they're going off on the mountains.
[6815.32s -> 6816.52s]  The best two maps are this one
[6816.52s -> 6818.76s]  and the one we're gonna play next.
[6818.76s -> 6819.80s]  And the worst one's that lava one
[6819.80s -> 6821.59s]  that we just got done playing.
[6821.59s -> 6825.65s]  That's my opinion.
[6825.65s -> 6831.83s]  I like the castle on the best.
[6831.83s -> 6837.82s]  What did you, what just hit me?
[6837.82s -> 6848.96s]  That guy just got a, ugh, that's on top.
[6856.08s -> 6862.28s]  Yeah, sweet, sweet grenade bliss.
[6862.28s -> 6864.12s]  Germo, you have 10,000 credits.
[6864.12s -> 6867.28s]  Use your super duper.
[6867.28s -> 6868.12s]  Okay.
[6868.12s -> 6871.08s]  How do you use that thing?
[6871.08s -> 6872.24s]  Three, four, five.
[6872.24s -> 6873.94s]  Yeah, three, four, five.
[6873.94s -> 6876.50s]  I'm just gonna shoot it randomly over here.
[6876.54s -> 6879.05s]  Let's see if I end the game.
[6879.05s -> 6880.73s]  I don't even, how big is the orbital strike?
[6880.73s -> 6881.77s]  Oh, yeah.
[6881.77s -> 6884.66s]  I think I ended it with my strike.
[6884.66s -> 6885.78s]  Orbital strike's huge.
[6885.78s -> 6886.62s]  Yeah, it's huge.
[6886.62s -> 6888.94s]  When I use it, I got like four or five kills of them.
[6888.94s -> 6892.16s]  Hey, 31 fly tailed medals.
[6892.16s -> 6893.36s]  Sick.
[6893.36s -> 6896.68s]  Simpsons 999, yes, italics is on that server.
[6896.68s -> 6902.31s]  Yeah.
[6902.31s -> 6907.04s]  Oh, all right though, I think that's,
[6907.04s -> 6909.57s]  that's gonna be it for the stream.
[6909.57s -> 6912.69s]  First place, second place, third place, fifth place.
[6912.69s -> 6914.20s]  Cool.
[6914.20s -> 6915.68s]  That's pretty legit.
[6915.68s -> 6918.50s]  Yeah, it's almost too legit, I'm gonna say.
[6918.50s -> 6919.98s]  Almost.
[6920.94s -> 6926.27s]  Yeah, sorry, Ari, if you didn't get it in time.
[6926.27s -> 6927.47s]  Sorry, I didn't get it in time, Ari.
[6927.47s -> 6929.72s]  Let's do it for next time.
[6929.72s -> 6932.57s]  Yeah, I know, I'm getting it for next time.
[6932.57s -> 6936.47s]  Yeah, thanks everybody for coming, appreciate it.
[6936.47s -> 6940.51s]  Are you gonna play QWOP to end the stream by yourself?
[6940.51s -> 6944.51s]  To end the stream by myself, I am.
[6944.51s -> 6946.43s]  I'm probably gonna go get some butter toast
[6946.43s -> 6950.33s]  because I just woke up and it's like 5 p.m.
[6950.33s -> 6951.61s]  All right, well, for bandwidth purposes,
[6951.61s -> 6953.65s]  I'm gonna just end the call.
[6953.65s -> 6955.53s]  No, I'm gonna end the call because I'm the host.
[6955.53s -> 6957.90s]  All right, well, thanks for coming to the stream, guys.
[6957.90s -> 6961.24s]  All right, see you next time.
[6961.24s -> 6962.08s]  Take care.
[6962.08s -> 6965.15s]  That is.
[6965.15s -> 6967.13s]  All right, let's play a little QWOP.
[6967.13s -> 6968.61s]  If you missed it, I'm gonna upload this whole thing
[6968.61s -> 6971.74s]  to YouTube, by the way.
[6971.74s -> 6973.51s]  So the whole thing will be on YouTube
[6973.51s -> 6979.41s]  if you missed the beginning.
[6979.41s -> 6982.17s]  Make sure this is even lined up.
[6982.17s -> 6984.41s]  Oh, what's this big annoying ad over here?
[6984.41s -> 6986.45s]  Oh my God, I'm refreshing this.
[6986.45s -> 6988.64s]  That's gonna give me a seizure.
[6988.64s -> 6996.26s]  Here we go, let's do it.
[6996.26s -> 7001.15s]  All right, I'm gonna really take my time with this.
[7001.15s -> 7004.26s]  See if I can get into slug mode again.
[7004.26s -> 7005.54s]  Yeah, thank you if you guys are taking off.
[7005.54s -> 7006.54s]  Thank you so much for coming.
[7006.54s -> 7007.98s]  If you missed the beginning of the stream,
[7008.02s -> 7010.96s]  it's gonna be on YouTube in the next probably couple hours.
[7010.96s -> 7012.88s]  Whenever YouTube decides to process it,
[7012.88s -> 7015.01s]  who knows how long that's gonna take.
[7015.01s -> 7018.24s]  But yeah, it's ended on this one last one.
[7018.24s -> 7021.00s]  Come on, now I'm going backwards.
[7021.00s -> 7025.28s]  Going backwards, that's not what I wanna do.
[7025.28s -> 7032.18s]  Uh, uh, dang.
[7032.18s -> 7033.54s]  If I get 10 meters, I'll be happy.
[7033.54s -> 7037.18s]  That's all I care about.
[7037.18s -> 7041.12s]  Oh yeah, I feel like I'm doing a dance move.
[7041.12s -> 7045.56s]  Like stick your left leg out, pull your left leg down.
[7045.56s -> 7049.51s]  That's gonna be the, oh my God.
[7049.51s -> 7052.84s]  I can't go forward.
[7052.84s -> 7055.40s]  My right leg is always the leg that I can never use.
[7055.40s -> 7056.40s]  I don't know why.
[7056.40s -> 7060.06s]  It just always ends up like that.
[7060.06s -> 7063.09s]  And that's when we fall backwards.
[7063.09s -> 7068.96s]  Ah, but yeah, thank you so much guys.
[7068.96s -> 7070.38s]  I'm gonna end it with that.
[7070.38s -> 7075.58s]  I am tired.
[7075.58s -> 7078.47s]  But yeah, I'll catch you guys later.
[7078.47s -> 7079.31s]  Thanks again for coming.
[7079.31s -> 7081.68s]  This will be on YouTube again, like I said.
[7081.68s -> 7083.48s]  So peace guys.
[7083.48s -> 7086.88s]  Oh, I'm getting some acid reflux.
[7086.88s -> 7087.80s]  But yeah, peace guys.
[7087.80s -> 7089.53s]  Thank you so much for coming.
[7089.53s -> 7091.63s]  Take care guys.
[7091.63s -> 7092.47s]  Bye.
