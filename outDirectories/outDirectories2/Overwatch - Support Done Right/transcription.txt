[2.36s -> 11.62s]  Hey, what's happening everybody? How you doing? Hope your day is good. Hope your day has been great good
[11.62s -> 15.98s]  It better be great. My name is German. Nice to see you. Nice to meet you. Gonna be hanging out
[15.98s -> 20.58s]  Gonna be talking about this new game that's been around. I'm sure you've heard of it. Sure. You've seen it
[20.58s -> 24.60s]  Maybe it's overwatch. I got into the closed beta. This is closed beta footage
[24.60s -> 28.68s]  I'm sorry. There hasn't been very much content on the channel this last couple of weeks
[28.68s -> 32.82s]  But if you can't tell I've been kind of sick and it's been one of those sicknesses
[32.82s -> 38.18s]  That's a relapsing sickness where you get better and then you get worse and you get better than you get worse
[38.18s -> 39.18s]  I don't know
[39.18s -> 42.22s]  I don't know what like mad scientist gave me like a poison potion
[42.22s -> 46.18s]  But I don't know what the fuck happened with that being said let's go on and get started here
[46.18s -> 47.14s]  So this is Lucio
[47.14s -> 52.34s]  This is one of the support characters and he's probably my favorite character to play as it stands right now in the beta
[52.34s -> 56.94s]  And that's because of how Blizzard has handled support in this game
[57.22s -> 60.52s]  every time I ever play a game that has support characters, whether it be a
[61.00s -> 62.52s]  MOBA or
[62.52s -> 67.16s]  First-person action game or something multiplayer anytime support is an available option
[67.88s -> 72.33s]  Nobody really wants to play it right like you get those people that like love to play support
[72.33s -> 76.73s]  I love playing support right like engineer is my favorite class in TF2. I love playing the healers
[76.73s -> 81.89s]  I love playing the support characters when I played World of Warcraft all of my characters were pretty much tank or healer
[81.89s -> 84.61s]  I didn't have very many damage-dealing mains or alternative like that
[84.65s -> 89.33s]  But in the grand scheme of things people shy away from support mostly because of why?
[89.85s -> 95.54s]  Because it's boring because you only do one thing and it's not that fun
[95.54s -> 97.82s]  You kind of somebody has to do it
[97.86s -> 103.02s]  it's just a question of who's gonna do it right and you get to that point where like four people have something picked and
[103.10s -> 107.22s]  There's no support or there's no tank and you just pick it because god damn it
[107.66s -> 112.47s]  Somebody's got to do it. So it might as well be me. That's not really how it worked in overwatch
[112.47s -> 114.97s]  I think Blizzard if they one thing could be said about Blizzard right now
[114.97s -> 121.05s]  They've done a fantastic job of making sure that the support characters are fun to play and do more than one thing
[121.37s -> 128.12s]  Because how it usually works is you're the stand behind you guy or hey, I'm in a corner looking at health bars
[128.12s -> 132.43s]  Does anybody need a buff every now and then that's what happens in most games now
[132.43s -> 137.05s]  There is mercy mercy is that kind of character in this game. She has a heal beam
[137.05s -> 143.93s]  She has a damage boost beam, but she's still fun to play and the other three quote support characters play
[144.33s -> 151.10s]  Wildly different than that. This is Lucio Lucio is a healer support character, but as you've been watching I'm skiing around
[151.10s -> 156.58s]  I'm skating around putting up the speed boost getting some kills jumping around wrapping around back to my teammates
[156.62s -> 159.98s]  You're not glued to somebody there is no standardized
[160.74s -> 164.64s]  Obligation to a certain character when you're playing somebody like Lucio. I have to move around
[165.02s -> 168.34s]  It's just how active you get to be like look at this. It's like a big fat guy down
[168.34s -> 171.42s]  I just punched this fat guy right in his stomach. See how active that was
[171.42s -> 177.14s]  See how active I just got to be and the best part about playing Lucio is all of his support stuff is AoE
[177.14s -> 184.86s]  I can switch between heal or speed so right now anybody that's standing even remotely near me gets a heal over time
[184.86s -> 190.02s]  I can boost it up with one of the abilities or I can switch over and make everybody run faster right now
[190.02s -> 193.58s]  Everybody's running fast and I just fucking compression blast that dude off the cliff
[193.58s -> 197.76s]  You got a compression blast too, but I got a long way to go. There's a lot more playing
[197.76s -> 202.20s]  There's a lot more testing to do. I've got a lot of shit that I want to be playing in this game
[202.20s -> 205.80s]  I did so awesome. It's been a long time guys
[205.80s -> 212.94s]  It's been a really long time since I've cared about the numbers the damage numbers in a certain video game or what?
[212.94s -> 215.86s]  How fast am I moving as this particular character like it?
[215.98s -> 218.68s]  It's been a long time and it's really cool to see that
[218.68s -> 223.46s]  I'm actually enjoying myself and any complaints that I have so far about the game are
[224.26s -> 231.75s]  Very aesthetic if I could check a box to lower the amount of the giant explosions and it muzzle
[231.87s -> 234.39s]  Flashes and stuff because they are kind of ridiculous
[234.87s -> 237.79s]  Especially if there's like three people doing their ultimate at the same time
[238.27s -> 243.95s]  You kind of have no idea what the hell is going on and maybe a couple of things in the UI that I'd like to
[243.95s -> 247.55s]  See change some of the indicators are way too big
[247.55s -> 249.55s]  I wish you could scale them down
[249.91s -> 256.47s]  Especially if you're a healer some of that stuff could be shrunken by it like 30% and I would be totally okay with it
[256.47s -> 259.53s]  But besides that it's very very good
[259.53s -> 265.09s]  I don't have very much to say that's bad about the game besides that so far and look I only have
[265.69s -> 269.93s]  15 or so 16 hours in the game and I'm sure there'll be plenty of amazing things
[269.93s -> 272.21s]  I'd love to talk about and I'm sure there'll be plenty of things
[272.21s -> 276.17s]  I'd like to talk about that aren't so amazing, but that's what a beta is for that's a closed beta
[276.21s -> 281.98s]  I mean, that's how you figure that stuff out, and I'm sure they will but that's gonna wrap it up here guys
[282.22s -> 283.90s]  Just a quick video
[283.90s -> 288.30s]  Number one just saying that the game's great. I've been playing overwatch and number two that I've been sick
[288.30s -> 290.50s]  And I'm sorry that hasn't been very much content on this channel
[290.50s -> 294.18s]  I've been working on like three videos that I just have not been able to finish
[294.42s -> 297.76s]  But anyways, I'm probably streaming right now if you go to my twitch
[297.76s -> 302.24s]  I'm gonna be streaming this game a lot so come to the stream go to star stream
[302.24s -> 307.12s]  I'll put both of our stream links in the description at any given moment this next at least couple of weeks
[307.12s -> 313.89s]  You'll probably see us streaming this game so come say hello come hang out and yeah, take care everybody
[313.89s -> 315.89s]  Thanks for watching. I'll see you all soon good
