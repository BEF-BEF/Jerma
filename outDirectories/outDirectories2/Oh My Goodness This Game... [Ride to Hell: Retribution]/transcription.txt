[0.31s -> 32.98s]  Oh, yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second. Wait. What is this? That was the most shocking
[32.98s -> 39.34s]  thing ever. Why am I shooting a machine gun at people? What happened to the cut scene
[39.34s -> 46.63s]  I was just watching? I was seriously going to start saying stuff. I have no, I don't
[46.63s -> 52.19s]  even know what to say. All I know is this. This was heavily requested that I... What
[52.19s -> 64.83s]  the fuck is going on? Look at this stupid controls. Stop giving me control if you're
[64.83s -> 83.49s]  just going to take it away. What the hell? What the hell's going on? Why did the bike
[83.49s -> 97.62s]  explode? What? No, don't even tell me. Don't even tell me his bike's going to explode.
[97.62s -> 103.94s]  Why? No. Oh, no. Oh, let's punch him and kick him. And I wonder what's going to happen
[103.94s -> 117.88s]  to his bike. Get the fuck out of here. Go blow up somewhere, dickhead. How did that
[117.88s -> 122.74s]  not take them off their bikes? And this guy with like his fucking lawnmower, like is this
[122.74s -> 128.66s]  guy driving a lawnmower? What is that thing? Seriously, get off like you have John Deere
[128.66s -> 136.88s]  and fight like a man. Oh, here comes like another guy. I've been driving in a straight
[136.88s -> 142.50s]  line for like at least a few minutes. How much further is it up down the road? Up down
[142.50s -> 149.44s]  the road. Yeah. Is that Scooby Doo? Hold on a second. Hold on. I need to go see Scooby
[149.44s -> 156.10s]  Doo and the gang. Get on the bike. I have Scooby Doo to track down. There it is. There
[156.10s -> 167.43s]  it is. Go back. Go back. Oh my goodness. All right. Let's slow down a little bit. I need
[167.43s -> 182.89s]  to see if okay. Okay. Alrighty, then. I can't move. Okay, I can move. I got it. How do you
[182.89s -> 193.06s]  Okay, you can block by holding space. And that's a punch. Oh, sick combos. Oh, look
[193.06s -> 201.40s]  out additional thugs. Just so you just punch them in the face. So this game is equal parts
[201.40s -> 205.86s]  terrible racing equal parts awful beat him up with a camera that doesn't even know where
[205.86s -> 212.39s]  it wants to go. Can I grab him or something? Oh, are we are we only throwing punches that
[212.39s -> 220.62s]  like drunk teenagers punch like throw? Oh, yeah, I did like a quick time event on you.
[220.62s -> 225.66s]  Hey, don't don't talk to my girlfriend like that. Don't talk to my girlfriend. She's my
[225.66s -> 235.57s]  girlfriend. No, you are slept alert. I can't believe you. Yay. It's fine. It's like fireworks,
[235.57s -> 239.40s]  honey. Don't worry. Yeah, I've come to the conclusion. This is probably the worst game
[239.40s -> 244.88s]  I've ever played in at least this generation. I mean, like something like big rigs over the road
[244.88s -> 249.84s]  racing like you saw the last video in this in this kind of series. That game came out a long time
[249.84s -> 257.44s]  ago. It had like a this game doesn't have any excuses. This is a next gen game. Why is it this
[257.44s -> 265.25s]  bad? Why is this game this dumb? This is like a next gen game for like, I don't know. I have no
[265.25s -> 276.19s]  answers. If somebody can give me the answer that I would love to hear it. What did his audio clip
[276.19s -> 284.88s]  just cut off? Okay, you know Batman Arkham Asylum and like Arkham City and stuff. It's almost like
[284.88s -> 290.00s]  they saw that game. And they said that's a really good fighting mechanic. Let's like put that in our
[290.00s -> 294.88s]  game too. But the reason why that was so much fun in the Batman games is because you're fighting
[294.88s -> 301.46s]  like a dozen people at the same time. And it's not just the same animation over and over again. It's
[301.46s -> 305.38s]  like completely like the countering system in Batman Arkham. This is like turning into like a
[305.46s -> 311.66s]  Batman Arkham Asylum is a fun game video, which it is. I mean, that's who can deny that Batman
[311.66s -> 315.98s]  Arkham City Arkham Asylum. Arkham Origins I'm sure is going to be good. Let's give me talk about
[315.98s -> 320.22s]  something good and not something bad like that. Who is this? Is this Macho Man Randy Savage?
[320.22s -> 331.01s]  Or is that Mr. T? Yeah, this aiming system is honest to God. I think it's trying to make me.
[331.65s -> 335.65s]  I think it's trying to auto aim for me. But there's no option to turn it off. Look at this.
[336.03s -> 341.71s]  When I go when I graze by an enemy, watch what happens. It's like goes out of control
[341.71s -> 351.31s]  right by him. Come on. You know, you want you don't want to aim at the ground. You want to
[351.31s -> 355.55s]  aim at me. I'm up in the window. Can you see me? Yeah, I'm up in the window. There you go.
[355.55s -> 361.87s]  No, no, no, not to the up in the window. Oh, you got me. Oh, I bet you $1,000.
[363.15s -> 370.38s]  They don't kill me. I bet you $1,000. I can walk right up to these crates and be completely fine.
[370.38s -> 376.03s]  Let's see. Yeah, I'm almost at the crates. They're getting a little more accurate.
[377.02s -> 387.01s]  I made it to the crates. And I'm completely on. Oh, you're you just got scared. Sure. Sure thing.
[387.01s -> 398.75s]  Sure thing. Yeah. Good. Good. Good. Good. Go back to the kick technique. Why am I missing him? What
[398.75s -> 406.02s]  the fuck am I missing him for? How am I missing him with a wrench? I'm hitting these guys with
[406.02s -> 414.66s]  a wrench and it's not even touching them. I'm done. If somebody you know owns this game,
[414.66s -> 420.34s]  go to their house, get them a cup of coffee, brew them some tea, get them a nice warm blanket,
[420.34s -> 426.26s]  wrap it around them and tell them you're sorry. Say, man, I know you spent like 20 bucks on that
[426.26s -> 432.75s]  game. I'm really sorry. Here's some tea and here's a blanket to keep yourself warm because you're
[432.75s -> 437.71s]  you're probably cold on the inside from playing this game. Thank you all so much for watching and
[437.71s -> 442.22s]  really do appreciate it. See you all next time. Take care, everybody.
