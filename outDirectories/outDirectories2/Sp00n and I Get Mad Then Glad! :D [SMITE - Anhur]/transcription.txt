[0.31s -> 12.85s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some Smite.
[12.85s -> 24.85s]  This is supposed to be the Ares breakdown video, but the reason why it's not here right now is because Ares just got a major change in the most recent patch for Smite.
[24.85s -> 28.85s]  And all the footage I had recorded was before the massive change.
[28.85s -> 34.85s]  So before I, of course, do a breakdown video on Ares and all of his moves and how I play him,
[34.85s -> 38.85s]  it would probably be better to record some new footage with the big changes.
[38.85s -> 42.85s]  So that's why you're not going to see that. It'll probably be there next week, next Sunday.
[42.85s -> 45.85s]  But in the meantime, I'm going to bring you a live commentary.
[45.85s -> 50.85s]  This is just going to be some stupid goofy highlights of me and Spoonerism playing the game.
[50.85s -> 55.85s]  And I'll let it speak for itself. Hopefully you enjoy the clips I've thrown together here, guys.
[55.85s -> 61.05s]  And I'll see you all next time. And of course, take care, everybody.
[61.05s -> 70.16s]  F3. Oh, I'm low on health.
[70.16s -> 77.24s]  Once I get this ultimate. Oh, Neath is shooting me with her freaking ultimate.
[77.24s -> 84.88s]  Ah, what the fuck? Oh, it interrupted my ultimate.
[84.88s -> 92.71s]  Are you OK? Neath shot an ulti over here. Is that why I died?
[92.71s -> 98.89s]  Yeah, she shot. Did she shoot me or you? I think she shot you. I think she shot me. Yeah, I think she shot you.
[98.89s -> 113.67s]  Go ahead. Where are they? Use it right now. Get this Q open. Bang. Oh, I'm crippled. Good. Good, good, good.
[113.67s -> 117.67s]  Damn it. I didn't have enough mana. Oh, this Kali is chasing you. This Kali is going nuts.
[117.67s -> 127.67s]  Shit, no. You'll be OK. Oh, I missed. Ah, shit. I didn't buy Aegis. Oh, man. I just got ultied by Neath in the mid.
[127.67s -> 139.63s]  Oh, Neath, bitch. Oh, what? Neath. Yeah, if I didn't miss that too, I probably would have killed that Kali as well.
[139.63s -> 144.87s]  But then I got ultied by freaking Neath. If I had mana, I would have killed Kali.
[144.87s -> 161.99s]  Ah, sorry. We're good. Yeah, she's a bitch. No, no, I didn't want to say that.
[161.99s -> 170.14s]  God damn it. I have to like right cancel. Yeah. Me and my like fat fingers.
