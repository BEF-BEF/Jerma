[3.45s -> 13.30s]  Hey, what's going on everybody? It's Jerma here with a quick quick video. I just want to go over a couple of things.
[13.30s -> 19.30s]  This is a very very small gameplay of a heavy domination on Yukon, I believe this map is.
[19.30s -> 23.30s]  I get double ubered from a critscreek and an uber charge and I kill like 15 people.
[23.30s -> 26.30s]  It's pretty destructive and I thought you guys might want to see it. Here we go.
[26.30s -> 56.30s]  Grgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgr
[56.30s -> 70.86s]  the
[70.86s -> 73.26s]  and just vote, it says only three or four questions.
[73.26s -> 74.82s]  So just please, if you guys could do that,
[74.82s -> 75.98s]  it would be awesome.
[75.98s -> 78.60s]  And hopefully, in the next couple weeks here,
[78.60s -> 80.06s]  I start to figure out how to livestream
[80.06s -> 81.74s]  and I'm hoping I can do it.
[81.74s -> 83.56s]  I'm hoping it'll really work out.
[83.56s -> 85.70s]  I don't really care if like 15 people watch it,
[85.70s -> 87.86s]  but as long as I know that some people will watch it,
[87.86s -> 89.18s]  I will do it.
[89.18s -> 90.66s]  So here's to hoping in the next few weeks
[90.66s -> 92.10s]  I get that to work.
[92.10s -> 95.50s]  The end of this gameplay, this very, very quick gameplay,
[95.50s -> 98.14s]  is actually kind of funny because I've run right
[98.14s -> 100.56s]  into an Uber while I have the crit screen on
[100.68s -> 102.92s]  and I kind of freak out and I just jump off the cliff
[102.92s -> 104.34s]  and get myself killed.
[104.34s -> 106.36s]  So I'm sure you guys will think it's pretty funny.
[106.36s -> 109.40s]  We probably could have done another crazy, insane domination
[109.40s -> 112.24s]  if we had just not had to run into that Uber.
[112.24s -> 115.64s]  But whatever, you know, stuff happens as they say.
[115.64s -> 117.56s]  Anyways, second little announcement I wanna make
[117.56s -> 120.12s]  is I'm gonna be on Pixel Enemy in the next couple of days,
[120.12s -> 121.90s]  probably either tomorrow or Tuesday.
[121.90s -> 124.16s]  I'm not really sure when they're gonna put my video up.
[124.16s -> 126.76s]  It's a Milkman Scout gameplay on Badlands,
[126.76s -> 128.04s]  King of the Hill Badlands.
[128.04s -> 129.20s]  So hopefully you guys check that out.
[129.20s -> 131.08s]  I'll make a Bolton when it comes out.
[131.08s -> 132.74s]  That's about it for today, guys.
[132.74s -> 134.80s]  Just wanted to put this out there to make sure you guys
[134.80s -> 136.72s]  knew about some of the things I'm working on,
[136.72s -> 138.20s]  some of the things I'm doing.
[138.20s -> 139.92s]  Thank you all so much for watching
[139.92s -> 141.46s]  and I'll see you all next time.
[141.46s -> 142.52s]  Take care, everybody.
