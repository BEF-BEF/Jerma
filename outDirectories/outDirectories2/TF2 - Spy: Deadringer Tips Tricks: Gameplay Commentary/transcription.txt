[9.34s -> 13.58s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? It's Jerma here again with another gameplay commentary.
[13.58s -> 17.02s]  This time we're playing as the Spy on Payload Badwater.
[17.02s -> 20.86s]  One of the more popular maps in the game. I've done a couple of commentaries on here, one or two.
[20.86s -> 24.86s]  Playing as the Spy as you see here with the Dead Ringer, the Big Erner,
[24.86s -> 28.70s]  and the new Diamondback, the new Spy Revolver.
[28.70s -> 31.98s]  I don't do anything with it. I don't even know why I had it equipped, to be honest.
[31.98s -> 36.38s]  So don't expect me to go on some kind of tangent with three or four or five crits.
[36.38s -> 39.50s]  I don't even get one crit in the gun one time.
[39.50s -> 44.10s]  I kill a couple people with it though, so don't be too too concerned about it.
[44.10s -> 50.55s]  And if you have not heard, tonight is the night that I do my live stream, my first ever live stream.
[50.55s -> 53.91s]  Don't be too mad because I'm not going to play Team Fortress 2 the entire time.
[53.91s -> 59.43s]  I'm going to play Team Fortress 2 for a while, but my plan guys is to play Deus Ex.
[59.43s -> 62.87s]  I haven't even loaded the game Deus Ex, so I have to install it.
[62.87s -> 65.11s]  So once that's installed, once it's all ready to go,
[65.11s -> 69.03s]  I want to stream that because I hear it is an unbelievably fun game.
[69.03s -> 70.81s]  There's a lot of choices in that game too,
[70.81s -> 74.25s]  so I'm sure you guys can help me pick the things when you're in the stream tonight.
[74.25s -> 77.93s]  So be online at like 9 o'clock tonight Eastern Time.
[77.93s -> 81.53s]  I'm not sure what that is for anybody else's time zones,
[81.53s -> 85.18s]  but try and be on 9 o'clock Eastern Time. Should be a fun time.
[85.18s -> 88.70s]  And oh my goodness, it's already been a minute and a half and I haven't killed one person.
[88.70s -> 92.62s]  Let's change that right now. Medic Demoman coming up here towards the point.
[92.62s -> 98.38s]  They already capped it, it's okay, but I get one, two, and I turn around and this medic is kind of alone.
[98.38s -> 101.27s]  I thought he was going to kill me, but no, I pump him full of lead.
[101.27s -> 103.75s]  So I bagged the triple right there, which is a good thing,
[103.75s -> 105.75s]  because now they do not have a medic right here.
[105.75s -> 109.21s]  And I'm going to give you some spy tips right now, guys.
[109.21s -> 114.25s]  A lot of people see these as unorthodox or as not super elite or not pro,
[114.25s -> 116.81s]  but I have found them to work great.
[116.81s -> 121.69s]  I'm going to give you a number one thing to do when you're playing as a dead ringer spy.
[121.69s -> 124.97s]  If it doesn't work for you, I'm sorry, it's not going to work for everybody,
[124.97s -> 127.85s]  but it works for me and it works for other people I've told it to,
[127.85s -> 129.85s]  and hopefully you can use it too.
[129.85s -> 136.63s]  So here it is, the secret to playing spy from Jerma, walk backwards.
[136.63s -> 141.27s]  See what I'm doing right here? I am just facing forward at my teammates
[141.27s -> 145.91s]  and walking straight back and nobody gives a crap to spy check me.
[145.91s -> 148.95s]  So I can go on a little tangent and kill three or four people,
[148.95s -> 151.27s]  and then take the... once you kill one or two people,
[151.27s -> 153.45s]  guys, this is something you have to remember.
[153.45s -> 159.37s]  Once you kill one or two people and there's not a third or a fourth right in your reach,
[159.37s -> 163.53s]  have the dead ringer out ready to go because you're going to get killed.
[163.53s -> 168.09s]  The dead ringer is an escape tool. It's not meant to be an invisibility watch.
[168.09s -> 171.13s]  See how I pulled it out right after killing one person? Don't freak out.
[171.13s -> 173.93s]  See how I let that guy take a swing at me? I just kind of stood there.
[173.93s -> 177.05s]  They know you're a dead ringer, but it's okay because it doesn't matter
[177.05s -> 181.53s]  because they're not going to find you. The only person that's going to find you is a pyro.
[181.53s -> 184.25s]  That's it. Nobody else can find you unless, of course,
[184.25s -> 187.61s]  you're standing completely still and a heavy is unloading on you.
[187.61s -> 190.89s]  I don't understand why that heavy, speaking of heavies, he didn't do anything about it.
[190.89s -> 194.17s]  Dead ringer's out, killed one person, nobody noticed me, apparently,
[194.17s -> 197.37s]  and now let's turn and walk with the team. Hey, I'm on your team.
[197.37s -> 202.17s]  No, see? Look what just happened. I walked backwards and that soldier was
[202.17s -> 205.77s]  completely oblivious and now I go on a tangent here and I get three kills in a row.
[205.77s -> 209.29s]  That is the spy tip of the decade for you.
[209.29s -> 214.41s]  Disguise as somebody on the enemy team and walk backwards.
[214.41s -> 219.05s]  Now, obviously, this is a strategy that is only able to be used with a dead ringer.
[219.05s -> 222.65s]  Don't do this with the invisibility watch because there's a chance that somebody could
[222.65s -> 226.09s]  just stray fire and kill you. That's why the dead ringer has to be out
[226.09s -> 229.53s]  when you're backwards and look at this. This whole room, they all want me dead and
[229.53s -> 233.45s]  I actually get one kill with that revolver. I thought that was pretty funny.
[233.45s -> 237.29s]  You have to probably imagine they were on the mic all screaming about me at the same time
[237.37s -> 241.45s]  and the whole team was pretty much in that room which I can imagine because I was alive
[241.45s -> 245.37s]  for about four minutes right there just killing a bunch of people out of their spawn over and over
[245.37s -> 249.29s]  and over again. Coming around this corner right here, I just want to get the dead ringer activated.
[249.29s -> 252.17s]  I don't really care about walking backwards at this point. There's a lot of people there
[252.17s -> 255.77s]  so I figured one of them would have probably spy checked me. I want to just get up here in this
[255.77s -> 260.26s]  corner. This is a great place to hang out as a spy. Get this heavy. I believe it's a domination.
[260.26s -> 264.82s]  It is, but who cares? Just trying to get someone to hit me. Come on, somebody hit me. There we go.
[264.82s -> 269.14s]  Coming around back up these stairs, a great place and we're going to do it all over again.
[269.70s -> 274.42s]  Spy is all about routine. You just got to get in the flow. You just got to get a feel for the class
[274.42s -> 277.86s]  because you kind of do the same thing over and over again. You rinse and repeat,
[277.86s -> 282.18s]  get hit with the dead ringer, come right around, exact same route, do the same exact thing,
[282.18s -> 285.94s]  get hit again, pull the dead ringer out, pull it around, go the same exact way,
[285.94s -> 290.74s]  jump across the stairs, do it again. People eventually will start to really get really
[290.74s -> 296.66s]  pissed off and really start to look for you and that's what you want. You want to cause chaos
[296.66s -> 301.30s]  because the longer they're looking for you, the longer they're not going to be capping the point
[301.30s -> 307.38s]  or not going to be going for the objective because remember guys, everything in this game is timed.
[307.38s -> 313.96s]  There's a time limit on every map so if you can take seconds off that clock by having important
[313.96s -> 319.16s]  classes come after you, looking around for you, always being afraid of you, you did your job and
[319.16s -> 325.40s]  your team is probably going to win the game because those last 10 seconds, even if it's 10-20 seconds,
[325.96s -> 330.84s]  overtime and everything like that is incredibly important so you could just screw the whole team
[330.84s -> 336.04s]  over. So I get this demo man with an ice stab, come up here and watch this stair stab fail.
[336.04s -> 341.02s]  I couldn't believe this. I was so pissed about this. What was wrong with that? My knife went
[341.02s -> 346.22s]  up and everything. The animation went up. I had it. It should have registered. It just didn't work.
[346.30s -> 352.95s]  Whatever. I've never done a stair stab before really so I was so upset about that.
[352.95s -> 357.51s]  Less than 40 seconds left here now. Coming around the corner. Kritzkrieg demo right here doesn't
[357.51s -> 362.71s]  really do too much so kill the medic. He had low health anyway so it's not a big deal. Hanging out
[362.71s -> 367.59s]  here, nobody saw me apparently. Nobody cared to look at me when I was disguising again.
[367.59s -> 372.17s]  Back stab is heavy. Go for the medic but it doesn't matter. I miss. Just trying to get behind
[372.17s -> 377.45s]  everybody and now we're at the point where there's less than 15 seconds left. I run into
[377.45s -> 384.87s]  another heavy right here and watch this guy. This is weird. What are you doing? Now you realize
[384.87s -> 389.70s]  I'm trying to kill you? What are you doing? So we end up winning this match. They get overtime but
[389.70s -> 393.86s]  it doesn't matter. Get a couple more people right here right before the match ends. Maybe one. I
[393.86s -> 398.58s]  think it's two. No, it is one. Thank you all so much for watching. I really appreciate everybody
[398.58s -> 403.94s]  that checks out my videos. Come to my live stream tonight guys. 9 p.m. Eastern Standard
[403.94s -> 409.06s]  Time in the United States. Check your local listings and find out what time that is for you.
[409.06s -> 413.24s]  Hope to see you all there. Should be a great time. Take care everybody. See you soon.
