[0.31s -> 13.02s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with some Enlighten.
[13.02s -> 22.02s]  This week's Enlighten is going to be a live Enlighten. I'm going to make a park in RollerCoaster Tycoon 3.
[22.02s -> 27.02s]  Now you're probably wondering, Jerma, RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 is not that old of a game.
[27.02s -> 29.02s]  So why are you doing Enlighten on this?
[29.02s -> 37.19s]  Well, with the recent disaster of the SimCity launch, I figured a lot of people are trying to find different city simulators,
[37.19s -> 45.19s]  trying to find different ways to get their fix for micromanagement god simulators, and this one is my all-time favorite.
[45.19s -> 51.37s]  It's going to be a lot of fun to reminisce during the gameplay while I'm making my park, while I'm making my people happy,
[51.37s -> 54.37s]  getting them burgers, getting them fries, getting them cokes and soft drinks.
[54.37s -> 59.37s]  If you've never played RCT, go get it right now. It's on good old games, it's on Steam.
[59.37s -> 65.37s]  RollerCoaster this one's on Steam, I believe for 30 bucks right now. It probably will go on sale at some point.
[65.37s -> 69.37s]  But it is a filling of the void for a lot of you SimCity guys.
[69.37s -> 73.37s]  So, let's get started here. I'm going to clap into the microphone accidentally, I'm sorry.
[73.37s -> 76.37s]  I'm going to do just a live playthrough of me making a park.
[76.37s -> 80.37s]  If you guys like it, please let me know, show some support if you want to see more of this,
[80.37s -> 82.37s]  and I'll see you guys all next time.
[82.37s -> 84.37s]  And of course, take care everybody.
[123.37s -> 129.32s]  Alright, well anyways, let's get these freeloaders out of here.
[129.32s -> 130.32s]  Nevermind, you can stay.
[130.32s -> 132.88s]  Let's start building this thing.
[132.88s -> 136.57s]  Park is closed, yeah. See you later people.
[136.57s -> 142.31s]  Let's go straight up here.
[142.31s -> 148.32s]  I don't want to go too far out because look at how huge this is.
[148.32s -> 152.56s]  So I made a custom scenario just to play.
[152.56s -> 158.80s]  I made just like, you know, no BS here in the beginning, just my own park. I can do whatever I want.
[158.80s -> 160.80s]  I think I made it a little too big.
[160.80s -> 164.36s]  But whatever, we're going to make this the best huge park ever.
[164.36s -> 167.36s]  So I want a ride to be here, here.
[167.36s -> 169.98s]  Let's just give some markers here.
[169.98s -> 174.70s]  I want more people to come in, I want there to be concession stands over this way.
[174.70s -> 179.30s]  So I want this to be...
[179.30s -> 182.57s]  So this is going to be the food court, right here.
[182.57s -> 185.81s]  This is where everybody's going to have to go to get food.
[185.81s -> 188.81s]  Whether you want burgers, fries, like I said in the beginning, this is where you're going to have to go.
[188.81s -> 190.81s]  So let's go ahead and make some of that stuff.
[190.81s -> 194.57s]  Food. Bison burgers.
[194.57s -> 198.32s]  Burgers. I don't want any weird, weird stuff.
[198.32s -> 202.16s]  Let's just get regular burgers.
[202.16s -> 203.16s]  So go right here.
[203.16s -> 206.23s]  We need some drinks to go with that.
[206.23s -> 209.14s]  Where are all the drinks?
[209.14s -> 211.50s]  Oh, actually fries, too.
[211.50s -> 217.62s]  Fries.
[217.62s -> 219.79s]  There's a lot of options here.
[219.79s -> 220.79s]  Oh, it's because I have all the expansion packs.
[220.79s -> 223.79s]  If you're wondering where like all this, like some of the stuff is coming from,
[223.79s -> 225.79s]  you can see I have like the wild expansion pack.
[225.79s -> 227.79s]  I have the soaked expansion pack.
[227.79s -> 230.67s]  Wait, is this like chocolate milkshakes?
[230.67s -> 234.30s]  Hell yeah, we're putting chocolate milkshakes in my pack.
[234.30s -> 238.42s]  Okay.
[238.42s -> 240.42s]  So that's all. You get burgers, fries, and a chocolate milkshake.
[240.42s -> 244.14s]  That's all you get.
[244.14s -> 247.66s]  I want shops over there, too.
[247.66s -> 248.66s]  Oh, here's the drinks. Here we go.
[248.66s -> 251.54s]  Oh, coffee. Definitely coffee.
[251.54s -> 252.54s]  If you want some coffee.
[252.54s -> 254.16s]  There it is.
[254.16s -> 255.98s]  That's a very odd looking place, by the way.
[255.98s -> 256.98s]  Look at this.
[256.98s -> 261.90s]  Is that where they get the beans?
[261.90s -> 264.91s]  That's kind of gross. What happens when it rains?
[264.91s -> 265.91s]  Floundering Ferry.
[265.91s -> 266.91s]  Merry-go-round.
[266.91s -> 267.91s]  Got to have a merry-go-round.
[267.91s -> 268.91s]  Oh, my goodness.
[268.91s -> 269.91s]  It's so dark in this park.
[269.91s -> 271.91s]  I don't have any lights.
[271.91s -> 273.22s]  Oh, no.
[273.22s -> 275.90s]  Nobody's going to be able to see.
[275.90s -> 278.98s]  There's the entrance and the exit.
[278.98s -> 281.79s]  Hey, welcome to the park.
[281.79s -> 283.79s]  Hope you like pitch blackness.
[283.79s -> 286.25s]  I need some lights.
[286.25s -> 288.25s]  Hold on. Where do I go to the lights?
[288.25s -> 292.05s]  Germaland.
[292.05s -> 299.61s]  Germaland is officially open to the public for eight bucks.
[299.61s -> 301.61s]  You get to come in.
[301.61s -> 304.61s]  You get to take a right, eat food, and then go on a merry-go-round.
[304.61s -> 306.61s]  And then you get the fuck out of here.
[306.61s -> 312.28s]  How disappointed.
[312.28s -> 315.28s]  How disappointed would you be if you came to this park?
[315.28s -> 317.42s]  This park sucks.
[317.42s -> 319.36s]  Come on, let's go.
[319.36s -> 320.36s]  Germaland's officially open.
[320.36s -> 323.36s]  We're like the thousands of people I want to get in here.
[323.36s -> 326.07s]  All right, now that that's open.
[326.07s -> 327.07s]  Wait, I need to make these.
[327.07s -> 328.07s]  I need to open these.
[328.07s -> 330.38s]  These are just all closed.
[330.38s -> 334.50s]  All right, there we go.
[334.50s -> 336.70s]  How much money?
[336.70s -> 337.70s]  How much money?
[337.70s -> 338.70s]  I want this to be...
[338.70s -> 342.92s]  No, you can just do default for now.
[342.92s -> 345.16s]  Standard coffee is $1.
[345.16s -> 346.16s]  Roast coffee is $1.50.
[346.16s -> 348.16s]  Okay, I'll keep the default prices for now.
[348.16s -> 350.34s]  If they become really popular,
[350.34s -> 352.34s]  that's when I'll start to really jack up the prices.
[352.34s -> 354.34s]  And suck everybody dry.
[354.34s -> 358.75s]  I still don't have any guests,
[358.75s -> 362.94s]  except for this dude right here.
[362.94s -> 364.94s]  Are you about to go ride this ride?
[364.94s -> 371.26s]  Look, Grandpa's going to go ride the merry-go-round by himself.
[371.26s -> 373.89s]  He's not really going to do that, is he?
[373.89s -> 376.22s]  He really is.
[376.22s -> 379.57s]  What?
[379.57s -> 380.57s]  This is the park inspector.
[380.57s -> 383.57s]  You are wasting electricity right now.
[383.57s -> 386.06s]  Did he pay for this?
[386.06s -> 388.26s]  He had to have paid for it, right?
[388.26s -> 394.66s]  No, he didn't even pay for it.
[394.66s -> 395.66s]  This guy didn't even pay for it.
[395.66s -> 397.66s]  Look, $0.00.
[397.66s -> 400.03s]  You scumbag.
[400.03s -> 401.03s]  Hold on a second.
[401.03s -> 402.78s]  Let's see.
[402.78s -> 405.30s]  Oh, here they come.
[405.30s -> 406.80s]  Here come the people.
[406.80s -> 408.23s]  Here come the people.
[408.23s -> 409.23s]  Here comes the one guy.
[409.23s -> 416.19s]  Nothing really for you to do down that way, dude.
[416.19s -> 417.19s]  He's going to get lost.
[417.19s -> 421.52s]  Come on, come on, to the concession stand
[421.52s -> 428.52s]  where we sell coffee, burgers, fries, milkshakes, coffee, milkshakes, burgers, fries, milkshakes, coffee, fries.
[428.52s -> 430.52s]  Oh, yeah, you know you want to go in there.
[430.52s -> 433.52s]  Take your little shit kids in there with you.
[433.52s -> 437.91s]  Dude, this lady's more excited than the kids.
[437.91s -> 440.91s]  She's like leaving her children behind.
[440.91s -> 442.60s]  What a psycho.
[442.60s -> 447.21s]  Let's get some more stuff built here.
[447.21s -> 450.50s]  Right there.
[450.50s -> 455.22s]  And regular path, asphalt.
[455.22s -> 456.90s]  There we go.
[456.90s -> 459.91s]  This ride is going to be $2.00.
[459.91s -> 460.91s]  Here we go.
[460.91s -> 464.82s]  Open it up.
[464.82s -> 466.58s]  Chair swing.
[466.58s -> 470.20s]  Oh, one of the really cool features about Rollercoaster Tycoon 3,
[470.20s -> 472.20s]  you can ride your rides.
[472.20s -> 474.20s]  You can get in your rollercoaster that you built,
[474.20s -> 475.20s]  or like this.
[475.20s -> 476.20s]  Ready?
[476.20s -> 478.44s]  Let's see if I can do it on the stupid friggin' Ferris wheel.
[478.44s -> 483.65s]  Let's see if I can ride it.
[483.65s -> 490.71s]  Oh, yay.
[490.71s -> 494.42s]  I'm having so much fun, mummy.
[494.42s -> 499.10s]  Why is the ride not starting?
[499.10s -> 502.36s]  I want to ride the ride, mummy.
[502.36s -> 506.97s]  The ride isn't starting.
[506.97s -> 513.18s]  Ah.
[513.18s -> 519.18s]  Okay, that's enough of that.
[519.18s -> 520.18s]  Oh, wait, wait.
[520.18s -> 522.35s]  I just heard, I just heard a money.
[522.35s -> 525.62s]  Who's going to ride the ride with me?
[525.62s -> 527.86s]  Oh, hey, let's go.
[527.86s -> 529.42s]  Which one are you going to get on?
[529.42s -> 530.42s]  Are you going to get on that?
[530.42s -> 531.42s]  Oh, here we go.
[531.42s -> 533.94s]  Here we go.
[533.94s -> 534.94s]  Here we go.
[534.94s -> 536.11s]  Here we go.
[536.11s -> 537.11s]  So excited, guys.
[537.11s -> 544.42s]  I'm about to ride the merry-go-round.
[544.42s -> 546.42s]  Why is nobody riding this ride?
[546.42s -> 549.23s]  This is one of the only things you can do in this whole park,
[549.23s -> 550.23s]  and nobody wants to ride it.
[550.23s -> 553.30s]  You guys are assholes.
[553.30s -> 554.30s]  Is it because there's too much money?
[554.30s -> 555.30s]  That's it?
[555.30s -> 557.86s]  That's the whole ride?
[557.86s -> 559.86s]  That was 10 seconds.
[559.86s -> 562.45s]  Look at this guy again.
[562.45s -> 563.45s]  The same dude.
[563.45s -> 566.45s]  The same, the same guy that's supposed to be, like,
[566.45s -> 569.45s]  inspecting my park is riding the merry-go-round again.
[569.45s -> 572.75s]  He's on the merry-go-round again by himself.
[572.75s -> 574.76s]  This guy is a freak show.
[574.76s -> 576.76s]  What's wrong with this guy?
[576.76s -> 578.83s]  I need to make some more stuff.
[578.83s -> 579.83s]  What are people saying about this park?
[579.83s -> 580.83s]  Do they hate this place?
[580.83s -> 582.20s]  Let's see.
[582.20s -> 583.95s]  Is someone watching me?
[583.95s -> 585.95s]  I hope it isn't too scary.
[585.95s -> 588.51s]  Talking about the merry-go-round, I guess.
[588.51s -> 590.07s]  I'm not hungry.
[590.07s -> 591.07s]  I'm not hungry.
[591.07s -> 592.07s]  I want to go on more rides.
[592.07s -> 594.07s]  I want to go on something more thrilling
[594.07s -> 596.07s]  than the merry-go-round.
[596.07s -> 597.95s]  What about you?
[597.95s -> 601.75s]  Where are all the rides?
[601.75s -> 602.75s]  I'm sorry.
[602.75s -> 604.70s]  I'm working on it.
[604.70s -> 605.70s]  We'll do another ride.
[605.70s -> 608.79s]  Here we go.
[608.79s -> 609.79s]  Thrill rides.
[609.79s -> 610.79s]  All right, you want a thrill ride?
[610.79s -> 611.97s]  I'll give you the disco.
[611.97s -> 615.10s]  I'm going to put the disco right here.
[615.10s -> 618.79s]  Yeah, right next to the merry-go-round.
[618.79s -> 622.57s]  That's not too bad.
[622.57s -> 628.44s]  That's not a bad place for that.
[628.44s -> 629.44s]  Wink, wink, wink.
[629.44s -> 634.03s]  And then what's with the flickering screen?
[634.03s -> 637.23s]  I don't think this game was meant to be recorded.
[637.23s -> 641.05s]  It's going, like, every few minutes.
[641.05s -> 642.05s]  Open this up.
[642.05s -> 643.61s]  Are we closed right now?
[643.61s -> 644.61s]  Yeah, the park is closed.
[644.61s -> 648.22s]  Admission.
[648.22s -> 650.22s]  I think these rides are too expensive.
[650.22s -> 651.22s]  I really think that's the problem.
[651.22s -> 653.22s]  People, like, don't want to ride a merry-go-round
[653.22s -> 654.22s]  for, like, three bucks.
[654.22s -> 655.22s]  How much did I make this?
[655.22s -> 658.80s]  Don't even have a bathroom.
[658.80s -> 661.81s]  Should I make these toilets, like, pay toilets?
[661.81s -> 664.62s]  How much of an ass would I be
[664.62s -> 667.62s]  to make these $0.10 to use the bathroom?
[667.62s -> 669.76s]  People would have to do it
[669.76s -> 672.76s]  and force people to have to spend $0.10
[672.76s -> 673.76s]  to go to the bathroom.
[673.76s -> 675.06s]  We're doing it.
[675.06s -> 677.39s]  Hey, if you want to go to the bathroom,
[677.39s -> 678.39s]  you don't want to spend $0.10?
[678.39s -> 680.39s]  There's, like, a Dunkin' Donuts
[680.39s -> 681.39s]  three miles down the street.
[681.39s -> 683.39s]  Yeah, good luck.
[685.02s -> 688.98s]  Not one person has bought anything
[688.98s -> 690.98s]  from any of these stalls.
[690.98s -> 691.98s]  Why?
[691.98s -> 693.86s]  What the hell did I do wrong?
[693.86s -> 697.02s]  What?
[697.02s -> 698.02s]  Are they too expensive?
[698.02s -> 704.79s]  Maybe there's not enough pickles.
[704.79s -> 708.85s]  All right, we'll drop the price.
[708.85s -> 709.85s]  Standard burger's gonna...
[709.85s -> 711.85s]  We'll drop it all by, like, $0.30.
[711.85s -> 716.46s]  I'm probably gonna lose money on this,
[716.46s -> 717.46s]  but you know what?
[717.46s -> 719.59s]  It's gotta happen.
[719.59s -> 720.59s]  People aren't buying anything.
[720.59s -> 723.05s]  Who comes to a theme park
[723.05s -> 724.05s]  and doesn't buy, like, a cheeseburger?
[724.05s -> 726.22s]  All right, that's right, everybody,
[726.22s -> 727.22s]  because it's always too expensive.
[727.22s -> 730.36s]  The only thing I ever buy at a theme park
[730.36s -> 731.36s]  is probably fried dough.
[731.36s -> 734.65s]  Small bag...
[734.65s -> 737.65s]  For $0.40, nobody is buying Hershey Kisses.
[737.65s -> 739.08s]  You guys, seriously,
[739.08s -> 741.08s]  that's like a stick of friggin' gum,
[741.08s -> 742.08s]  and you're not even gonna buy it?
[742.08s -> 744.73s]  All right, all right,
[744.73s -> 745.73s]  we got a pretty good audience right here.
[745.73s -> 746.73s]  Look at these people,
[746.73s -> 747.73s]  like, all ready to roll.
[747.73s -> 749.03s]  We got birds over here.
[749.03s -> 750.03s]  Look at these birds.
[750.03s -> 753.55s]  No one's riding this ride.
[753.55s -> 755.43s]  Do you people know this ride exists?
[755.43s -> 758.63s]  Maybe my pathing sucks.
[758.63s -> 762.79s]  With drastic, drastic measures,
[762.79s -> 763.79s]  we're gonna build a roller coaster.
[763.79s -> 768.55s]  The facelift or the fear slinger?
[768.55s -> 769.55s]  Let's do the facelift.
[769.55s -> 770.55s]  Look at this thing.
[770.55s -> 773.50s]  62 mile-per-hour speeds?
[773.50s -> 774.80s]  You better believe it.
[774.80s -> 777.30s]  Where are we putting this thing?
[777.30s -> 779.47s]  Holy shit, this thing is huge!
[779.47s -> 783.30s]  Uh, it's going right here.
[783.30s -> 785.47s]  It's gonna go over the swing ride.
[785.47s -> 787.10s]  Wait, where's the, uh...
[787.10s -> 789.66s]  Let me see where the entrance is.
[789.66s -> 790.66s]  It's over there, I think.
[790.66s -> 792.60s]  Bang, there we go.
[792.60s -> 794.42s]  There's...
[794.42s -> 796.42s]  Wow, look at those shadows!
[796.42s -> 797.72s]  Oh!
[797.72s -> 801.18s]  Those shadows are so ugly!
[801.18s -> 804.21s]  Entrance is over here.
[804.21s -> 808.58s]  Let's go with...
[808.58s -> 811.68s]  Let's do the exit first.
[811.68s -> 813.37s]  Just because...
[813.37s -> 814.37s]  Just because...
[814.37s -> 820.75s]  People are gonna have to walk a mile
[820.75s -> 822.75s]  to get to this damn thing.
[822.75s -> 825.66s]  You don't have enough funds?
[825.66s -> 826.66s]  I don't have enough money?
[826.66s -> 828.92s]  I can't even open this thing!
[828.92s -> 829.92s]  How much was this?
[829.92s -> 835.14s]  Was this roller coaster, like, all of my money?
[835.14s -> 837.14s]  Oh, my goodness.
[837.14s -> 838.14s]  Oh, good thing...
[838.14s -> 840.14s]  Good thing Venom from Spider-Man
[840.14s -> 841.14s]  has taken over my park.
[841.14s -> 842.45s]  Look at this symbiotes suit
[842.45s -> 845.45s]  that's literally taking over my entire park.
[845.45s -> 847.71s]  Are you guys ready?
[847.71s -> 848.71s]  We're gonna do testing.
[848.71s -> 850.89s]  We're gonna ride my roller coaster, baby.
[850.89s -> 852.89s]  It's an inverted coaster.
[852.89s -> 853.89s]  Oh!
[853.89s -> 855.96s]  Whoa!
[855.96s -> 858.29s]  Look at this.
[858.29s -> 859.29s]  This is the coolest part,
[859.29s -> 860.29s]  because you can build your own coaster.
[861.29s -> 863.29s]  You can build your own coaster from scratch
[863.29s -> 865.29s]  with all these cool things,
[865.29s -> 866.29s]  and you can ride it.
[866.29s -> 868.98s]  You can look down at your park over there.
[868.98s -> 869.98s]  I know mine sucks,
[869.98s -> 870.98s]  but you know what?
[870.98s -> 871.98s]  Here we go.
[871.98s -> 876.60s]  Oh, my God!
[876.60s -> 878.97s]  Whoa!
[878.97s -> 881.40s]  Whoa!
[881.40s -> 883.15s]  The twist!
[883.15s -> 884.15s]  You're in the twist!
[891.58s -> 892.58s]  This is so cool.
