[0.70s -> 4.30s]  What's going on guys? It's Germo once again with a gameplay commentary.
[4.30s -> 10.54s]  This time I am on King of the Hill Harvest with the Uber Update Soldier.
[10.54s -> 14.86s]  I know in a previous video I said that I could not use the Uber Update Soldier.
[14.86s -> 17.74s]  I didn't like the rocket launcher. I didn't like the three rockets.
[17.74s -> 20.70s]  But I have had a change of heart because I started playing with it.
[20.70s -> 22.38s]  I said I'm going to give it another chance.
[22.38s -> 26.46s]  And I absolutely wreck complete house in this gameplay.
[27.10s -> 29.66s]  Unfortunately we lose both of the games you're going to see.
[29.74s -> 35.18s]  But I was very proud of how I was absolutely destroying people with this setup I got here.
[35.18s -> 38.06s]  The shotgun, I love the shotgun. I didn't like it at first.
[38.06s -> 40.38s]  But it reminds me of the Frontier Justice.
[40.38s -> 42.22s]  I like having the three shots to be honest.
[42.78s -> 44.62s]  Like I said, it reminds me of the Frontier Justice.
[44.62s -> 46.46s]  And I'm really good with the Frontier Justice.
[46.46s -> 48.14s]  Especially when you get those crits.
[48.14s -> 52.22s]  It's like a Frankenstein Frontier Justice in my opinion.
[52.22s -> 53.98s]  This is funny. I get this sniper off guard.
[53.98s -> 55.99s]  And I get him with the da whip.
[55.99s -> 57.03s]  A lucky crit right there.
[57.03s -> 58.79s]  But he probably still would have died.
[58.79s -> 61.70s]  And also to talk about the whip for a second.
[61.70s -> 65.22s]  Is anybody else having hit detection problems with this thing?
[65.22s -> 67.22s]  I was really gung-ho about using this.
[67.22s -> 68.58s]  And I really was excited for it.
[68.58s -> 70.42s]  And I was looking forward to it.
[70.42s -> 74.02s]  And it seems like 40% of the time you hit somebody with the whip.
[74.02s -> 74.74s]  Nothing happens.
[75.30s -> 77.94s]  I feel like it's happened so many times where I've hit somebody.
[77.94s -> 81.46s]  And it's just like, nope, sorry, nothing happened.
[81.46s -> 83.62s]  You didn't hit him apparently.
[83.62s -> 84.50s]  I don't know.
[84.50s -> 86.90s]  It might just be lag compensation or something like that.
[87.38s -> 89.38s]  Hopefully there's a fix for that.
[89.38s -> 91.78s]  Because it's kind of annoying.
[91.78s -> 94.55s]  Because I feel like now after using it for a while.
[94.55s -> 99.27s]  It's only use is to run out of the spawn when a round starts really fast.
[99.27s -> 101.03s]  I feel like that's the only use it has now.
[101.03s -> 101.67s]  This is pretty cool.
[101.67s -> 102.95s]  I jump over here.
[102.95s -> 103.91s]  Kill this Demoman.
[103.91s -> 104.71s]  I did it!
[104.71s -> 105.21s]  No!
[106.58s -> 107.14s]  I didn't.
[109.35s -> 110.47s]  But honestly though.
[111.19s -> 115.19s]  I know people are going to be giving me examples of how the whip is useful.
[115.19s -> 116.47s]  And where you should use it.
[116.47s -> 116.79s]  I don't know.
[116.79s -> 119.83s]  I just switch in between too many weapons every three seconds.
[119.83s -> 120.79s]  Like, oh, I've got to whip this guy.
[120.79s -> 121.51s]  Then grab my shotgun.
[121.51s -> 122.15s]  Then whip this guy.
[122.15s -> 122.71s]  And then run over here.
[122.71s -> 123.51s]  And then whip that guy too.
[123.51s -> 124.71s]  And I've got to whip him too.
[124.71s -> 125.59s]  By the way, this is great.
[125.59s -> 127.91s]  This shows my expertise in Team Fortress.
[127.91s -> 128.15s]  Ready?
[128.15s -> 129.11s]  Watch this.
[129.11s -> 130.49s]  We get the cap.
[130.49s -> 132.81s]  And then here comes the brigade of people.
[132.81s -> 134.81s]  You would expect that we were going to win this, right?
[134.81s -> 137.61s]  You would think that we were going to win this with only like 15 seconds left.
[137.61s -> 139.13s]  And like 12 people here.
[139.13s -> 140.57s]  Murder that Demoman.
[140.57s -> 143.05s]  Murder that soldier with a crit because he jumped in the air.
[143.05s -> 144.63s]  This thing is cool.
[144.63s -> 145.59s]  Pyro comes over.
[145.59s -> 146.79s]  He gets destroyed.
[146.79s -> 148.31s]  Shot with a shotgun three times.
[148.31s -> 149.78s]  He's dead.
[149.78s -> 151.46s]  In comes, I believe, a spy.
[151.46s -> 153.48s]  Yep, spy, dead.
[153.48s -> 155.24s]  I kill like seven or eight people here.
[155.24s -> 156.68s]  Oh, you're dead too, spy.
[156.68s -> 157.91s]  And look.
[157.91s -> 159.35s]  Look who comes to ruin the fun.
[159.35s -> 162.15s]  An ubered friggin' heavy.
[162.15s -> 163.99s]  And that's why we lost the match.
[163.99s -> 167.26s]  I was going to just toss this gameplay out the window.
[167.26s -> 172.89s]  But I figured that because this is only like three minutes long at this point.
[172.89s -> 174.41s]  That I'd use another one.
[174.41s -> 175.61s]  And here's another full gameplay.
[175.61s -> 178.09s]  And I do very, very well in this one too.
[178.09s -> 180.09s]  But we still seem to lose.
[180.09s -> 183.29s]  But it's fun, I guess, to see me kill people and, you know, wreck house.
[183.29s -> 184.17s]  So that'll be cool.
[184.73s -> 190.17s]  So when this next match starts, you're going to get to see an example of what I'm talking about with the whip.
[190.73s -> 194.33s]  There are so many people in spawn right now that it's actually useful to hit people.
[194.33s -> 196.57s]  Because there are people walking in front of you.
[196.57s -> 198.25s]  This medic is kind of right in front of me.
[198.25s -> 199.29s]  I can get him.
[199.29s -> 201.05s]  And it works out very, very well.
[201.77s -> 206.81s]  The only problem now is when I die and I have to spawn again.
[206.81s -> 208.73s]  See, I die from this scout that's right here.
[208.73s -> 210.17s]  He hits me with the soda popper.
[211.16s -> 215.08s]  And the problem now is when I spawn, there's nobody that's going to be around to whip.
[215.08s -> 216.52s]  Which is the whole point of the weapon.
[216.52s -> 219.32s]  You need somebody to be right next to you to be able to hit them.
[219.32s -> 223.14s]  And with the hit detection being so odd that I can't even figure it out.
[223.14s -> 224.34s]  See, watch, you'll see what I'm talking about.
[224.34s -> 225.78s]  Here's the hit detection problem.
[225.78s -> 228.23s]  See, ready?
[228.23s -> 229.43s]  I didn't hit him, apparently.
[229.43s -> 234.31s]  I hit that, I actually hit the sniper is who I actually came in contact with.
[234.31s -> 237.51s]  So when I first hit that medic and it made the noise and I didn't move.
[237.51s -> 238.95s]  That happens all the time.
[239.35s -> 241.75s]  And maybe I was a little bit too far away for that example.
[241.75s -> 242.87s]  But it still made the noise.
[243.43s -> 246.31s]  I mean, why would it make the noise if it wasn't going to be contact?
[246.31s -> 247.19s]  You know what I mean?
[247.19s -> 249.35s]  And plus there are much worse occasions where that happens.
[249.35s -> 251.35s]  When I would hit somebody right in their face.
[251.91s -> 255.67s]  Like directly right into their face or in their back and I don't move at all.
[255.67s -> 258.87s]  So if I'm missing some part of the mechanic of this item.
[258.87s -> 261.83s]  Somebody please let me know if I'm just being an idiot.
[261.83s -> 263.75s]  And it's like, oh, you have to be running straight.
[263.75s -> 265.43s]  You can't, I don't know.
[265.43s -> 267.27s]  So me and this medic both get on the point.
[267.27s -> 268.31s]  We cap it.
[268.31s -> 272.23s]  I'll stop talking about the whip now and I'll start talking about the gameplay.
[272.23s -> 273.99s]  That was a nice backstab from that spy.
[273.99s -> 275.11s]  He really did save my life.
[275.75s -> 278.47s]  Heavy medic pair comes around the corner and they don't go for the point.
[278.47s -> 281.91s]  So I think maybe I can come over here and do something about it.
[281.91s -> 283.67s]  But this soldier ends up killing me anyways.
[283.67s -> 284.79s]  I do a quick little check.
[284.79s -> 287.03s]  I hit tab and I realized I was recording with fraps.
[287.03s -> 289.93s]  So I was like, oh, shit, no, I can't do that.
[289.93s -> 293.05s]  Because normally I record with the demo feature and then watch it.
[293.05s -> 294.57s]  And then I'll export it.
[294.57s -> 296.73s]  But I normally don't record with fraps.
[296.81s -> 303.53s]  But now that I've started doing that, I'm so compulsive when it comes to looking at my scores.
[303.53s -> 304.65s]  Like, oh, did I get an assist?
[304.65s -> 306.17s]  Oh, how many points did I get?
[306.17s -> 308.25s]  Nice little turnaround shot, by the way, on that soldier.
[308.25s -> 310.33s]  I get a good three or four kill streak here in a row.
[310.97s -> 314.17s]  And I'm going to have to learn how to not do that.
[314.17s -> 319.21s]  I'm going to have to really, really try hard to not hold down tab every five seconds.
[319.21s -> 320.17s]  It was very difficult.
[320.73s -> 324.17s]  So I smash this medic with a crit, come out here, and then watch this lag.
[324.17s -> 325.53s]  This ruined everything.
[325.53s -> 327.45s]  See, oh, you see that little glitch right there?
[327.45s -> 328.97s]  That was a bunch of BS.
[328.97s -> 330.57s]  Because I probably would have killed that heavy.
[330.57s -> 332.50s]  I was on a roll right there.
[332.50s -> 334.26s]  So I was very disappointed about that.
[334.26s -> 336.42s]  And they end up getting back on the point.
[336.42s -> 340.42s]  And I really wanted to win this because I hate doing gameplays where you lose.
[340.42s -> 345.30s]  Because it's kind of like, well, you did good and you were contributing to the team.
[345.30s -> 347.38s]  But you guys still lost.
[347.38s -> 348.42s]  I want to see you win.
[349.06s -> 351.06s]  And then I say, OK, well, I'm trying.
[351.06s -> 352.74s]  I'm trying as hard as I can, guys.
[353.54s -> 355.94s]  So don't ask me what that Pyro was doing.
[355.94s -> 357.86s]  Our Pyro was just behind him spraying him.
[357.86s -> 360.74s]  And he was just so deliberate on killing that sniper.
[360.74s -> 361.94s]  But he just couldn't do it.
[362.66s -> 367.30s]  So I come out here, get this scout, dominate him, dominate the Pyro before him.
[367.30s -> 368.18s]  And guess what?
[369.53s -> 371.45s]  Yep, dominate that spy, too.
[371.45s -> 373.29s]  So that's three dominations in a row.
[373.29s -> 375.29s]  So I feel like I'm doing OK now.
[375.29s -> 376.25s]  I'm having a good time.
[377.21s -> 380.89s]  But it's short-lived because now is where I start to fall apart.
[380.89s -> 382.25s]  And the team starts to fall apart.
[383.21s -> 387.61s]  And now that I have a second, you can watch me be a moron for two or three lives in a row.
[387.61s -> 388.33s]  I get a few kills.
[388.33s -> 391.69s]  It's not terrible, but not like what you've been seeing so far.
[392.65s -> 397.45s]  So now that there's a second, if you haven't done the Terraria contest yet,
[398.25s -> 400.25s]  I'm giving away three copies of Terraria.
[400.25s -> 402.41s]  If you haven't seen the video, go watch it.
[402.41s -> 403.29s]  It's the last video.
[403.29s -> 404.65s]  I'll put a link to it in this video.
[404.65s -> 406.41s]  But it's the last video I uploaded before this.
[407.05s -> 409.29s]  If you haven't done it, there's really good odds right now, man.
[409.29s -> 412.33s]  There's only three or four Minecraft videos.
[412.33s -> 415.77s]  So I highly recommend you go check it out and try and make something.
[415.77s -> 418.17s]  All the submissions so far, the Team Fortress 2 ones,
[418.17s -> 420.49s]  the comments and the Minecraft video ones,
[421.85s -> 423.29s]  they are off the wall.
[423.29s -> 424.73s]  Some of them are hysterical.
[424.73s -> 428.25s]  It's going to be so hard to pick between all these great submissions.
[428.25s -> 432.81s]  But I plan on sitting on Monday night for like three hours,
[432.81s -> 435.61s]  just deliberating with myself to figure out what I'm going to pick.
[436.41s -> 442.09s]  And by the way, some of you guys are insane with the comment section of the contest.
[442.33s -> 445.21s]  It's a riot, some of the things you guys are writing.
[445.21s -> 447.85s]  And it's going to be so difficult to pick one.
[447.85s -> 448.89s]  But I got to pick one.
[448.89s -> 449.93s]  And it's this Tuesday.
[449.93s -> 451.05s]  So go get your submission.
[451.05s -> 453.77s]  And if you haven't done it, don't wait till the last minute.
[453.77s -> 455.05s]  It's a good teacher.
[455.05s -> 458.26s]  I'm Mr. Germa, your math teacher.
[458.26s -> 460.58s]  Your submission, if it's late, you're going to get an F.
[461.38s -> 463.54s]  But anyways, back to the gameplay.
[463.54s -> 467.94s]  In overtime, we capped the point, which is great because I was so happy.
[467.94s -> 470.02s]  I thought that, okay, let's hold this.
[470.02s -> 472.82s]  And maybe it won't be a complete failure.
[472.82s -> 475.62s]  And we do hold it for a wicked, wicked long time.
[475.62s -> 478.26s]  It's a great, great little set we do here.
[478.82s -> 479.86s]  This heavy gets over here.
[479.86s -> 481.06s]  I'm thinking, okay, heavy's here.
[481.06s -> 481.86s]  I'm here.
[481.86s -> 482.90s]  We're going to be able to do this.
[482.90s -> 485.27s]  And then there's a sentry.
[485.27s -> 491.96s]  And that person is using the strategy that I talked about in the King of the Hill Lakeside video I did.
[491.96s -> 499.29s]  So very, very nice job doing the big sentry on a King of the Hill map and making me walk into it.
[499.29s -> 501.05s]  So we still have control of this point.
[501.05s -> 502.25s]  And right now I'm freaking out.
[502.25s -> 510.33s]  I'm trying to get up there really, really fast because I was hoping that this could be a gameplay I could talk about where it's like, look, we come from behind and we win.
[510.33s -> 512.65s]  So I am not playing games here right now.
[512.65s -> 514.01s]  I really want to win this.
[514.01s -> 517.77s]  This heavy medic pair comes around the corner and their push is unsuccessful.
[517.77s -> 522.58s]  He actually gets killed by the sentry, I believe, the mini sentry that was in here.
[522.58s -> 526.18s]  So I'm trying to get a few rockets over to this side to kill that sentry.
[526.18s -> 527.14s]  Demoman comes in.
[527.14s -> 528.58s]  I ruin his day.
[528.58s -> 530.98s]  And now I get two rockets.
[531.06s -> 533.54s]  One, two, and I get the sentry down.
[533.54s -> 537.94s]  And now, at this point, I am saying to myself, we're going to win this.
[537.94s -> 539.06s]  There's a mini sentry in here.
[539.06s -> 540.18s]  We got a medic.
[540.18s -> 541.30s]  This is fantastic.
[541.30s -> 543.62s]  I was so skittish and edgy right now.
[543.62s -> 544.90s]  Get this engineer.
[544.90s -> 545.78s]  I was so happy.
[545.78s -> 546.50s]  I was like, this is it.
[546.50s -> 547.22s]  We're going to win.
[547.22s -> 549.51s]  They don't got, they got nothing right now.
[549.51s -> 552.46s]  And look at what happens again.
[552.46s -> 557.90s]  The same heavy medic pair from last round that screwed everything over once again.
[557.90s -> 561.75s]  They screw it over again and we lose.
[561.75s -> 566.31s]  My head was down in the, like my chin was down into my chest.
[566.31s -> 568.55s]  And I was really, really sad about that.
[568.55s -> 574.90s]  So thank you for watching this depressing gameplay commentary on King of the Hill Harvest.
[574.90s -> 578.31s]  And hopefully, hold on a second.
[578.31s -> 579.11s]  Oh, okay.
[579.11s -> 580.07s]  I'm okay.
[580.07s -> 583.75s]  Hopefully you enter the contest and I look forward to your submissions
[583.75s -> 587.27s]  and I look forward to more and more crazy comments.
[587.27s -> 588.63s]  Keep it coming, guys.
[588.63s -> 590.39s]  And I'll see you guys next time.
