[0.31s -> 15.14s]  Alright, what's going on everybody? It's Germa here with Boo Man 61 and MLC Stealth.
[15.14s -> 19.77s]  Gonna be doing... Hey, I'm trying to do the intro here.
[19.77s -> 24.77s]  Gonna be doing a live commentary on Payload Race Hoodoo.
[24.77s -> 27.77s]  And what am I doing? I'm just like standing here.
[27.77s -> 32.77s]  I'm playing an engineer. I'm just like standing still going like, okay, so I play this game like this.
[32.77s -> 39.77s]  That's just like you're a Germacraft where you're telling stories and building the same tower of blocks and taking them down.
[40.77s -> 44.07s]  I gotta move this thing. I can't stand her anymore.
[44.07s -> 48.07s]  Did you say Payload Race? Did I say Payload Race?
[48.07s -> 51.07s]  I think you said Payload Race. Maybe I did.
[51.07s -> 54.07s]  We're here on Payload Race Hoodoo.
[54.07s -> 58.25s]  Is Payload Race where there's two of them? That's not what this is.
[59.25s -> 64.25s]  That's not what this is. If that's what I said, then I'm totally incorrect and that's not what this is.
[64.25s -> 67.42s]  This is on regular Payload.
[67.42s -> 72.69s]  Oh man, they're gonna... No, I got it. I got it. I'm good to go.
[72.69s -> 76.57s]  They seem to have a lot of soldiers.
[76.57s -> 82.34s]  Unless they get an Uber, I don't think they're gonna be able to get over here.
[82.34s -> 88.91s]  Oh, come at me. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god.
[88.91s -> 92.09s]  Ah, I knew that was gonna happen.
[92.09s -> 95.78s]  Is that sentry still alive? Yep.
[95.78s -> 99.85s]  I was trying to back away from it. I was just getting hit too hard.
[99.85s -> 102.85s]  Boo, the floggy pyro bastard.
[102.85s -> 106.66s]  Wait, what the... Oh, I went in his hell border. Whoops.
[106.66s -> 108.66s]  I need to change my name.
[108.66s -> 111.66s]  Oh, I just shot through that. Oh, lucky crit.
[111.66s -> 113.66s]  There, they got it.
[113.66s -> 119.48s]  Alright, time to go like real floggy pyro.
[119.48s -> 124.18s]  Trying to get another sentry up. Come on. Come on.
[124.18s -> 126.86s]  Alright, there's another sentry sitting here.
[126.86s -> 129.42s]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[129.42s -> 135.46s]  That was close. Spy, spy pyro, spy pyro.
[135.46s -> 138.83s]  Spyro. Oh, save Martin Van Buren's...
[138.83s -> 140.83s]  We got it, we got it. Teleporter.
[140.83s -> 143.83s]  Or, what's that called? Oh god, I don't have any ammo.
[143.83s -> 145.83s]  I don't have any ammo.
[145.83s -> 151.95s]  God, get this spy out of here.
[151.95s -> 158.38s]  No, keep him off the cat. No, they got it.
[158.38s -> 161.81s]  Oh my god, it just teleported right into the middle of the wall.
[161.81s -> 164.56s]  Shit.
[164.56s -> 166.56s]  Yeah, this teleport is still up.
[166.56s -> 171.18s]  Oh, not anymore, not anymore. It's gone.
[171.18s -> 173.18s]  That's spy. I knew it.
[173.18s -> 175.62s]  I can smell ya.
[175.62s -> 177.62s]  I can smell ya from a mile away.
[177.62s -> 180.79s]  I can smell ya getting off the elevator.
[180.79s -> 182.79s]  Oh, wait, that's from Home Alone.
[182.79s -> 184.79s]  Oh, come on.
[184.79s -> 187.79s]  I can smell ya getting off the elevator.
[187.79s -> 191.57s]  What was it? Home Alone?
[191.57s -> 194.26s]  Phony bop.
[194.26s -> 196.26s]  You were smooching all over everybody.
[196.26s -> 199.65s]  That is such a fantastic movie.
[199.65s -> 201.65s]  And happy new year.
[201.65s -> 203.65s]  What did you call him?
[203.65s -> 205.65s]  That's a spy.
[205.65s -> 207.65s]  Wow, we have like four snipers sitting in the back here.
[207.65s -> 209.65s]  I just got clubbed.
[209.65s -> 211.65s]  I got the spy. Oh, save my century, thank you.
[211.65s -> 213.65s]  Marcus Van Machinery, you are...
[213.65s -> 215.65s]  Machinery.
[215.65s -> 217.65s]  Am I even saying that word right?
[217.65s -> 223.21s]  For the longest time, I didn't know how to pronounce the machinist with Christian Bale.
[223.21s -> 225.21s]  I thought it was called the Machinist.
[225.21s -> 227.21s]  The Machinist.
[227.21s -> 229.21s]  The Machinist.
[229.21s -> 231.21s]  That was a sniper up there.
[231.21s -> 233.21s]  The Machinist. Oh my god, that guy.
[233.21s -> 235.21s]  How is that guy still up there?
[235.21s -> 237.21s]  Yeah, he had nowhere to go.
[237.21s -> 239.21s]  The gates closed behind him.
[239.21s -> 241.21s]  Kind of trapped himself.
[241.21s -> 243.21s]  Poor bugger.
[243.21s -> 246.98s]  They're coming through the tunnels up ahead.
[246.98s -> 249.80s]  Oh, get through there.
[249.80s -> 253.96s]  Let's get this thing built.
[253.96s -> 257.99s]  Oh, beautiful.
[257.99s -> 259.99s]  The devil man up on the top left.
[259.99s -> 261.99s]  He's being a real prick.
[261.99s -> 263.99s]  Yeah, there's a heavy up there and a medic.
[263.99s -> 265.99s]  He's trying to take this stuff out.
[265.99s -> 267.99s]  Oh god.
[267.99s -> 269.99s]  The heavy's dead.
[269.99s -> 271.99s]  Oh, they're trying so hard.
[271.99s -> 273.99s]  I'm moving it.
[273.99s -> 275.99s]  I'm reflecting everything away.
[275.99s -> 277.99s]  This thing is going to go down. You good?
[277.99s -> 280.36s]  See? Look at that.
[280.36s -> 282.36s]  It's all right there.
[282.36s -> 286.33s]  What's up, pirate spy?
[286.33s -> 288.33s]  I think he clubbed.
[288.33s -> 290.33s]  I'm reflecting every single thing.
[290.33s -> 292.33s]  I didn't realize you were doing that.
[292.33s -> 295.08s]  Thank you.
[295.08s -> 300.07s]  You were just sitting next to this man.
[302.70s -> 304.70s]  Wow, that is crazy.
[304.70s -> 307.96s]  You've been babysat by a pyro.
[310.46s -> 312.46s]  I'm just going to shoot down this hall.
[312.46s -> 316.23s]  All right, I think I can leave now.
[316.23s -> 318.23s]  Oh no, I can't.
[318.23s -> 321.94s]  No, they're going to get my dispenser.
[321.94s -> 324.31s]  Oh, the devil man's back for more.
[324.31s -> 326.31s]  Here's a real test of might right here.
[326.31s -> 328.31s]  Follow me up here.
[328.31s -> 330.31s]  I'm going to put the sentry up in front of that god damn door.
[330.31s -> 332.31s]  No, I'm going to die.
[332.31s -> 335.45s]  I just had two quick runs in a row.
[335.45s -> 337.45s]  Go up those stairs.
[337.45s -> 339.75s]  Go up around the left of this corner over here.
[339.75s -> 341.75s]  I'm going to try and put the sentry right in front of the door.
[341.75s -> 343.75s]  Go up there and protect me.
[343.75s -> 345.75s]  Is that a spy?
[345.75s -> 348.31s]  All right, lock it.
[348.31s -> 350.31s]  Good.
[350.31s -> 353.13s]  Did they open this door?
[353.13s -> 355.13s]  They are in big trouble.
[355.13s -> 359.16s]  I almost just made that devil man kill himself.
[359.16s -> 361.16s]  I almost just made that devil man kill himself.
[361.16s -> 364.23s]  I'm going to save my dispenser.
[364.23s -> 366.23s]  Sniper in the tunnel.
[366.23s -> 369.24s]  I just saw that.
[369.24s -> 371.24s]  I was trying to reflect it back at him
[371.24s -> 373.24s]  the second it opened and it would kill him.
[375.24s -> 377.24s]  Which I almost did that.
[377.24s -> 379.24s]  Oh, great.
[379.24s -> 381.24s]  Not happening.
[381.24s -> 383.24s]  You're not taking this out.
[383.24s -> 385.24s]  Oh, he got it anyways.
[385.24s -> 387.24s]  I tried.
[387.24s -> 389.24s]  I tried to run.
[389.24s -> 391.54s]  I'm doing my own cold demo right now.
[391.54s -> 393.54s]  Did you just kill him or did he kill himself?
[393.54s -> 395.54s]  He killed himself.
[395.54s -> 398.23s]  Okay.
[398.23s -> 400.23s]  I scouted him.
[400.23s -> 402.41s]  He has 5,000 kills.
[402.41s -> 404.41s]  It's fun being a troll pyro.
[409.58s -> 411.75s]  Demoman in the caves ahead.
[411.75s -> 413.75s]  I need a medic.
[413.75s -> 419.06s]  I need a medic.
[419.06s -> 422.52s]  Oh my god, there's two demoman up on the left.
[422.52s -> 424.52s]  The left walkway.
[424.52s -> 427.77s]  If you have sentries, they're going down.
[427.77s -> 429.77s]  Trying to shoot up there.
[429.77s -> 434.70s]  Trying to punch him through.
[434.70s -> 436.70s]  Open up that door.
[436.70s -> 440.34s]  Get slotted.
[440.34s -> 442.34s]  Oh, three health.
[442.34s -> 445.03s]  Okay, that's really cool.
[445.03s -> 447.03s]  They got anything going on?
[447.03s -> 449.21s]  They got a dispenser. Get out of town.
[449.21s -> 451.51s]  That's a spy pyro.
[451.51s -> 453.51s]  Where'd he go?
[453.51s -> 458.68s]  I have no idea.
[458.68s -> 460.68s]  There's the teleporter.
[460.68s -> 463.37s]  Did they get another one?
[463.37s -> 465.74s]  I think there's another teleporter somewhere.
[465.74s -> 468.30s]  Oh, that's so unlucky.
[468.30s -> 470.30s]  Oh, it's a battle of wits.
[470.30s -> 472.54s]  He got me.
[472.54s -> 474.54s]  How does he have full health?
[474.54s -> 477.42s]  How does he have full health?
[477.42s -> 480.74s]  There's not health right there.
[480.74s -> 483.82s]  I hit him twice with that frying pan.
[483.82s -> 485.82s]  That's what we call grade A bull snip.
[485.82s -> 488.25s]  Two demoman on the car and a mini sentry
[488.25s -> 490.25s]  behind it.
[490.25s -> 492.25s]  This is bad news.
[492.25s -> 497.22s]  Okay, I'm going heavy.
[497.22s -> 501.70s]  They might get this.
[501.70s -> 503.70s]  No attack. I'm on the point.
[503.70s -> 507.16s]  Oh, damn.
[507.16s -> 509.16s]  No, get him up.
[509.16s -> 511.16s]  Dude, I have no...
[511.16s -> 514.42s]  Oh, damn.
[514.42s -> 516.42s]  I got a lot of points.
[516.42s -> 518.42s]  I had a critscreek. I was going to give it to you
[518.42s -> 520.86s]  right away, but I just got murdered.
[520.86s -> 522.86s]  Oh, well.
