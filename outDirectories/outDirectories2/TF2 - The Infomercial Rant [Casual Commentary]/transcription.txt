[0.31s -> 14.14s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[14.14s -> 18.14s]  And tonight, gonna be playing as the Soldier with items equipped.
[18.14s -> 21.38s]  If I didn't have items equipped, I'd be running around punching people.
[21.38s -> 24.38s]  I'd be the Heavy, but I'm not the Heavy, I'm the Soldier.
[24.38s -> 28.38s]  Anyways, we're gonna be talking about something in this video, not the gameplay. It's gonna kinda sit in the background.
[28.38s -> 31.38s]  We're gonna bring up something that I was thinking of the other night.
[31.38s -> 34.38s]  I was lying in bed, and I was watching TV.
[34.38s -> 42.80s]  And when you watch TV late at night, you get to be introduced to the wacky, wonderful wizard world of infomercials.
[42.80s -> 52.23s]  If you don't know what an infomercial is, an infomercial is a commercial that is an entire block of television length, right?
[52.23s -> 58.47s]  It's a 30 minute long commercial, where they just keep playing the same thing over and over again.
[58.47s -> 62.84s]  And usually, it's a joke. It's never something I ever take seriously.
[62.84s -> 66.84s]  And I think a lot of people are in the same boat, where you're just sitting there watching the TV, and you go,
[66.84s -> 71.64s]  What the hell am I watching right now? Can I change the channel?
[71.64s -> 76.64s]  The problem with an infomercial is you have some weird sorcery spell on you.
[76.64s -> 81.64s]  You can't change the channel. You reach for the remote, but it's so dumb and so enticing,
[81.64s -> 85.64s]  and there's so many stupid cliches, like the black and white screen of people doing something really stupid,
[85.64s -> 89.64s]  like their house exploding because they used the wrong onion peeler.
[89.64s -> 93.64s]  You've got to keep watching, and you can't grab the remote. You have to sit there and watch it.
[93.64s -> 99.14s]  I've done that before, and I've seen so many infomercials, I think, over the course of my life,
[99.14s -> 105.14s]  that I've become so accustomed to these things that it's like a game of Jeopardy.
[105.14s -> 109.14s]  You ever watch Jeopardy, and you see something, and you yell out the answer,
[109.14s -> 113.14s]  and you're like, God damn it, Jake, why couldn't you get that? It was George Washington.
[113.14s -> 119.38s]  I do that with infomercials, because they become so predictable with all the dumb shit that they pull
[119.38s -> 125.38s]  that I treat it like it's a game, like the buy one, get one free thing they do in these infomercials.
[125.38s -> 130.38s]  Here's one example, right? Buy one, get one free. Oh, the super blender.
[130.38s -> 133.38s]  If you buy one, you get the second one absolutely free.
[133.38s -> 138.38s]  No, no, no, no, no, they're including the second blender in the price of the first one.
[138.38s -> 141.38s]  You're paying for two blenders. They're just telling you one is free.
[141.38s -> 147.87s]  And sometimes, the thing that they're giving you two of is something you would never actually even want two of.
[147.87s -> 150.87s]  They're just forcing you to take the second one, right?
[150.87s -> 153.87s]  Well, you have a blender. It's in your house. It does the blending.
[153.87s -> 157.24s]  You don't need two of them. What, are you going to give it to your friend?
[157.24s -> 160.24s]  You're going to give it to your mother or something? Your mother's going to look at you and go,
[160.24s -> 164.24s]  Honey, I have a fucking blender. Like, I don't need to get this out of here.
[164.24s -> 169.42s]  And someone's going to throw it away. Or you give it to like a bum, and he makes like bum smoothies.
[169.42s -> 175.78s]  A bum smoothie is pretty simple, pretty basic. It's one pack of cigarettes with one broken up cigarette in it.
[175.78s -> 181.78s]  A banana peel, an apple core, and piss. And then you blend it up in a bum smoothie.
[181.78s -> 189.22s]  Like, no, but seriously though, can you possibly imagine a world where all the dumb infomercial crap
[189.22s -> 194.46s]  that we have been used to for like the last 20, 30, 40 years, it was brought over to gaming?
[194.46s -> 199.21s]  I actually kind of wish there was an infomercial for a video game.
[200.21s -> 206.21s]  I can picture in my head just how outrageous and how stupid and unbearably dumb
[206.21s -> 210.58s]  a video game infomercial would be. What would it even be? What would you do?
[210.58s -> 215.58s]  I can't really think of that many options for any of these directors or marketing people.
[215.58s -> 221.88s]  But then again, there are countless infomercials on mops and like dustpans.
[221.88s -> 225.88s]  If they can do that, if they can do dustpan and mop infomercials,
[225.88s -> 228.88s]  I'm pretty sure they could come up with something for Call of Duty.
[228.88s -> 234.42s]  I mean, they've done infomercials on books. How do you do an infomercial on a book
[234.42s -> 236.42s]  that people just sit there and they talk about the book?
[236.42s -> 241.10s]  And an infomercial for a game could be pretty damn funny.
[241.10s -> 245.10s]  I mean, I could just picture like the black and white screen like we talked about before.
[245.10s -> 250.10s]  It's some lady sitting there and she's playing Battlefield and it's really, really dumpy looking.
[250.10s -> 254.10s]  It's like 2D old NES graphics on the screen.
[254.10s -> 258.10s]  And there's a voiceover that comes on and says, has this ever happened to you?
[259.10s -> 263.10s]  And the lady's like teeth just start falling out and she's like, I don't have my fucking teeth.
[263.10s -> 269.10s]  And then it cuts immediately to a bright, nice, colorful screen with big 3D graphics.
[269.10s -> 272.10s]  And she's sitting there so happy, she smiles right in the camera.
[272.10s -> 276.10s]  She's playing Call of Duty and it's like, ding, her teeth are like nice and shiny.
[276.10s -> 283.10s]  And a voiceover comes back on and just says, if you play Call of Duty, you'll never see this problem again.
[283.10s -> 287.85s]  That would be so stupid. What am I talking about? This would suck.
[287.85s -> 292.54s]  And I want to mention this because I know that's going to start a fight in my comment section.
[292.54s -> 296.54s]  I don't mean COD is better than Battlefield, Battlefield is better than COD.
[296.54s -> 301.54s]  That was just a strict example because I know that'll start like an enormous fight in my comment section.
[301.54s -> 303.54s]  So please don't do that. It was just an example.
[303.54s -> 310.29s]  Back on topic, infomercials don't really work on our generation.
[310.29s -> 316.46s]  My generation and younger, like the 20 to 30 crowd and younger, we don't care about infomercials.
[316.46s -> 320.46s]  We never probably will because they're not really targeted to us.
[320.46s -> 324.46s]  Infomercials are targeted to people usually from a much older generation.
[324.46s -> 332.46s]  People that will take into consideration when buying a product how many marbles were sucked up into the vacuum during the demonstration.
[332.46s -> 338.83s]  Like, oh, did you see that, honey? He picked up 12 marbles. I wonder if my vacuum can do that.
[338.83s -> 345.83s]  We don't need that. We don't need some magic magician TV box man to show us the same demonstration
[345.83s -> 352.83s]  we've essentially been seeing now on TV and infomercials for the last at least 30 to 40 years.
[352.83s -> 360.26s]  At the click of a button, you can compare prices and compare features and efficiency on anything
[360.26s -> 364.26s]  you could possibly imagine in the world for a product.
[364.26s -> 369.95s]  But just wanted to get that off my mind. It was on my chest and I had to get it out there.
[369.95s -> 372.95s]  If you guys have anything to say, of course, leave it in the comment section.
[372.95s -> 377.13s]  Keep the discussion going and that's going to wrap up the video.
[377.13s -> 379.13s]  So thank you all so much for watching. Really do appreciate it.
[379.13s -> 385.93s]  And of course, take... Whoa! Whoa! Who's on the phone? Who's calling me right now? Hello?
