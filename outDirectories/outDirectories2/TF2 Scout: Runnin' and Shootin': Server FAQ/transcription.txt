[0.31s -> 15.78s]  Hey, what's up everybody. Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary. And
[15.78s -> 21.30s]  tonight, gonna be playing as the Scout with the Default Scattergun, the Criticola, and
[21.30s -> 25.92s]  the Candy Cane. Yeah, the Candy Cane. And in this gameplay, it's on King of the Hill Harvest.
[25.92s -> 31.66s]  This is on my new server. The IP of which will be in the description. Go check it out.
[31.66s -> 36.62s]  Go play on it. There's no reserve slots or no admins really there yet. Except for me,
[36.62s -> 41.54s]  I think Boo, Stealth, and Burger Boy are the admins at this point right now. But there
[41.54s -> 45.06s]  will be more. I don't know how I'm gonna do this, guys. I'm trying to figure out a way
[45.06s -> 49.14s]  to get people reserve slots without giving out a million of them. Because what I don't
[49.14s -> 53.70s]  want to have happen is this. I don't want to give out 50 reserve slots and have the
[53.70s -> 57.94s]  same 50 people, the only ones I can play in the server. I don't want that to happen. So
[57.94s -> 62.62s]  I might not even do reserve slots. I'm still going back and forth in my brain trying to
[62.62s -> 66.74s]  figure it out. But there will be admins. You can get admin. I don't know how that's
[66.74s -> 71.51s]  going to work though. I will make that very clear in a future video. So don't worry.
[71.51s -> 74.24s]  If you're trying to figure that out, do not worry.
[74.24s -> 77.04s]  So another thing, a really important thing about the server. I want to answer a couple
[77.04s -> 81.32s]  of frequently asked questions about this server. And I'll start right now right off the bat
[81.32s -> 87.78s]  while this game plays in the background. So it is a 24-7 server. It is not 8 to 8 in the
[87.78s -> 93.07s]  morning or something. It is all 24-7 dedicated. It's not like sitting right here in my backyard
[93.75s -> 98.87s]  It is in New York City. I think it also says New Jersey on it too. I'm not exactly sure
[98.87s -> 103.55s]  where the town is. But if you live in New York City or around there, you're probably
[103.55s -> 109.76s]  going to have like two ping. So that's pretty cool. Second thing I get all the time is what
[109.76s -> 114.38s]  are the custom mods and the plugins you're going to add and all that stuff eventually.
[114.38s -> 118.38s]  So let me start with my favorite one. Eventually on that server, there is going to be the friendly
[118.38s -> 123.50s]  fire spawn kill mod. I have no idea what it's called. All I know is I want it. There's something
[123.50s -> 128.78s]  about just the pure chaos in the setup time of a game. People just destroying each other
[128.78s -> 132.32s]  in the spawns. I think that will be there at some point. Another thing that's going
[132.32s -> 137.68s]  to be there at some point is probably something like HL stats or game stats. One of those
[137.68s -> 141.32s]  stat tracking programs. Because I used to love when I had a favorite server in Team
[141.32s -> 146.36s]  Fortress, I would always do slash rank, wanted to see where I was compared to everybody else.
[146.36s -> 150.20s]  And I think that's an innate thing that we all love to do as Team Fortress players. And
[150.24s -> 154.24s]  even just FPS players in general, you always love to see where you are in regards to other
[154.24s -> 159.64s]  people. So that will be there soon. Probably HL stats X, only because that's the one I'm
[159.64s -> 164.48s]  the most familiar with. And when all these things get installed, once I do all these
[164.48s -> 168.92s]  mods and once I do all these different plugins and stuff like that, we're going to have to
[168.92s -> 173.80s]  really experiment because I have no idea if they're ever going to work. I might turn the
[173.80s -> 179.00s]  server on one day, install one of these plugins and it's like, Oh, German, the server exploded.
[179.00s -> 184.60s]  Whoops. So I don't want that to happen. I want to slowly, gradually get these things
[184.60s -> 189.72s]  installed to have the least amount of headaches and the least amount of downtime that I could
[189.72s -> 194.94s]  possibly have. So one of the last things that people asked me and people wanted to make
[194.94s -> 199.82s]  sure was theirs, there are no random criticals on that server. I turned them off tonight.
[199.82s -> 205.42s]  Well, tonight, oh my goodness, it's like three in the morning. So earlier tonight, I turned
[205.42s -> 210.50s]  them off. We tested it. It worked. So there are no more random crits on that server. There
[210.50s -> 215.62s]  is still damage spread though. I'm not going to turn off damage spread. I'm also not going
[215.62s -> 219.66s]  to turn off pellet spread. I'm going to keep it all as the defaults, all as out of the
[219.66s -> 224.78s]  box TF2, except for the no crits. And the reason why I'm doing that is I just feel like new
[224.78s -> 229.46s]  players when you're in a no crit server and no spread, everything, it's very hard to do
[229.46s -> 234.18s]  well if you're new. So I just wanted to keep it as default as I can. And I guess you could
[234.18s -> 239.82s]  say that those are my reasons. So that is the end of the server talk. And one thing
[239.82s -> 243.86s]  I wanted to bring up before that this video is over is I tried to get a stipulation match
[243.86s -> 248.14s]  tonight, and I couldn't do it. I think the item servers are down for Team Fortress, or
[248.14s -> 251.74s]  at least they were for like a good long two or three, four hour period when I was trying
[251.74s -> 255.56s]  to play. So if those item servers come back, that's probably the next video you're going
[255.56s -> 260.18s]  to see is a stipulation match. I'm not going to tell you which class and what stipulation
[260.18s -> 264.72s]  it is, because I know a lot of you guys like to be surprised by that. So I will keep my
[264.72s -> 269.24s]  lips sealed. I'll keep that a secret. And one last thing before I got forgot this. Oh
[269.24s -> 273.64s]  my goodness, I forgot Diablo three comes out in like three days. I already have the thing
[273.64s -> 278.12s]  pre purchased. It's going to own my life. And you're going to see a lot of content on
[278.12s -> 283.12s]  Diablo three. And my question for this video to you guys, please let me know in the comment
[283.12s -> 288.44s]  section. What type of videos do you think you would like to watch? If you were to watch
[288.44s -> 293.20s]  Diablo three? Do you want to see class breakdowns? Do you want to see kind of like more of a let's
[293.24s -> 297.88s]  play like highlights, boss kills? What do you think you guys would like to see in Diablo
[297.88s -> 302.32s]  three for videos? That is my question of the video guys. Thank you all so much for watching.
[302.32s -> 307.88s]  I really do appreciate it. And I'll see you guys all soon. So take care, everybody.
