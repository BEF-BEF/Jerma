[0.31s -> 14.63s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[14.63s -> 20.63s]  And tonight, gonna be playing as the Heavy on Badwater on Offense.
[20.63s -> 26.63s]  Gonna be using the default minigun, the strange shen, which that's not true.
[26.63s -> 29.63s]  The regular sandwich. I don't think there is a strange sandwich.
[29.63s -> 33.81s]  And the gloves of running urgently, as you see right here.
[33.81s -> 38.11s]  So this commentary is gonna be a little bit different, gonna be a little more strange, a little more weird.
[38.11s -> 39.11s]  You see what I did there?
[39.11s -> 46.48s]  I just drank like five coffees and I decided, what if I drop all my conventional wisdoms of commentary
[46.48s -> 52.48s]  and just hit record after having a bunch of caffeine and just let loose and see what I say and see what happens.
[52.48s -> 57.48s]  I'll talk about what happens on the screen, I'm gonna talk about random stuff, but you know, whatever, let's just go.
[58.48s -> 64.72s]  So this is gonna be called, The Coffee Commentary of Justice and Doom.
[64.72s -> 68.86s]  Rated R.
[68.86s -> 73.04s]  As you can see, this is already going off to a great start.
[73.04s -> 77.04s]  So what am I gonna talk about? Let's talk about of course what's going on on the screen and what am I doing here?
[77.04s -> 80.41s]  Well, it's Team Fortress 2 for one thing, one of my favorite games.
[80.41s -> 83.41s]  Okay, that really just scared the crap out of me.
[83.41s -> 86.41s]  I forgot that happened and that just, I felt like I was in the game.
[87.41s -> 90.84s]  Will you get out of my face? I'm trying to talk to my friends.
[90.84s -> 93.02s]  Thank you, he's gone.
[93.02s -> 96.02s]  But I forgot that happened and I actually couldn't believe I was still alive at this point.
[96.02s -> 102.02s]  A soldier comes around the corner, right here I think it is, and he starts shooting at me and I don't die.
[102.02s -> 108.02s]  I couldn't believe I was still alive. I was praying I wasn't gonna die because obviously I wanted to keep this run going.
[108.02s -> 116.02s]  And this run does go for a pretty long damn time and that is a spy, you're dead twice.
[116.02s -> 121.32s]  So talking about Badwater for a minute here, I want to bring up, don't get me wrong, I love Badwater.
[121.32s -> 125.32s]  Badwater is probably my second or third favorite map in this game.
[125.32s -> 131.32s]  But while you're attacking, it is the most frustrating thing if they have a good defense on the last point.
[131.32s -> 136.32s]  And hold on a second, I shit you, yeah, that was the noise he made.
[136.32s -> 141.56s]  So attacking on Badwater the last point is almost impossible if they have a good defense.
[141.56s -> 144.56s]  It is almost impossible and it's the most frustrating thing.
[144.56s -> 149.56s]  Because you'll see, once we get up to this second or last checkpoint and we start turning the corner and we start going around,
[149.56s -> 156.56s]  it stops to a snail's pace, like a legit slug. We are slugs when we get around this corner.
[156.56s -> 161.56s]  And look at how fast we've been going. We have been absolutely rolling this whole entire time.
[161.56s -> 165.74s]  And what stops us is a couple of level three sentries down the bottom.
[165.74s -> 171.74s]  And nobody can really get down there because of course it's on an incline and everyone's kind of down in the pit,
[171.74s -> 176.91s]  just tossing up grenades and like throwing fire bombs and firecrackers on your front lawn.
[176.91s -> 182.15s]  And it can be very frustrating. So I mean, I had to cut like four minutes off of this gameplay,
[182.15s -> 189.15s]  specifically because it was just me jumping down to my death, getting slaughtered by the sentry guns every two seconds.
[189.15s -> 192.15s]  And it was just failed push after failed push after failed push.
[192.15s -> 198.15s]  So I figured chew the fat off a little bit, get you the good stuff, get you the real milk and cookies of the gameplay,
[198.15s -> 200.15s]  and you get to see the ending too. So don't worry.
[200.15s -> 205.78s]  So now I got a less than 150 health. This is not a good position to be in. Run away from that cart.
[205.78s -> 211.78s]  I shoot this soldier right in his spinal cavity, right where it hurts the absolute goddamn most.
[211.78s -> 217.78s]  And now I want to talk about this hat. A lot of people ask me, Jermo, what the hell is that thing on your head?
[217.78s -> 220.78s]  Wait, is that the Eiffel Tower? What the hell is that goddamn thing?
[220.78s -> 225.78s]  And I will explain. I got that hat from a gift from the Kritz cast guys.
[225.78s -> 229.78s]  They give away, I think every week they do a show when they give away a hat.
[229.78s -> 234.78s]  And that's the hat they give away. It's the vintage lo-fi long wave, I think it's called.
[234.78s -> 237.78s]  And you can only get it if you get Player of the Week. And that sniper.
[237.78s -> 244.02s]  Oh, I was so mad at that guy. I was my hand buried down into my keyboard.
[244.02s -> 250.02s]  I was so pissed about that because I thought I could stay alive and get a full game one life, but it didn't happen.
[250.02s -> 253.02s]  But yeah, I got that from the Kritz cast guys. They're really cool dudes.
[253.02s -> 258.19s]  I may in fact be on the Kritz cast at some point. I don't know when.
[258.19s -> 261.19s]  I mean, we kind of went back and forth about maybe doing something, but I'm not sure.
[261.19s -> 264.37s]  Maybe in the future you'll see me on that podcast.
[264.37s -> 267.37s]  But anyways, let's return to the gameplay.
[267.37s -> 272.37s]  Seeing this sentry right here, I know I can outrange it because the engineer is kaput. He is dead.
[272.37s -> 275.37s]  And the lower right, a spy just sapped that one as well.
[275.37s -> 280.37s]  So right now we have like a little tea party going on in this cart now. We are going to win this.
[280.37s -> 286.25s]  There's no reason why we can lose. I can't think of one reason. We're going to win. We won the game, right?
[286.25s -> 291.68s]  You fucking sniper. We were going to win right there, man. Come on. Why'd you do that?
[291.68s -> 295.80s]  All right, we got over it. We're good now.
[295.80s -> 298.80s]  So I bump into a dead ringer spy right here. Either that or it was lag.
[298.80s -> 301.80s]  And I feel like that happens more often than it should.
[301.80s -> 305.80s]  Where you got to, what the hell did I bump into somebody? But it turns out you didn't.
[305.80s -> 308.80s]  But anyways, this is the end of the gameplay. We win the game right here.
[308.80s -> 311.80s]  Top fragging as House Targaryen.
[311.80s -> 314.80s]  If you watch Game of Thrones, you'll understand that reference.
[314.80s -> 320.30s]  It's a very good show. I could go on for hours about that show, but I'll do that a different time.
[320.30s -> 324.30s]  So let me know if you guys like this new style of commentary. Not going to do it every single time.
[324.30s -> 326.30s]  But just trying something a little different.
[326.30s -> 329.30s]  So I'll see you guys all soon. That wraps up the video.
[329.30s -> 331.30s]  And I'll catch you guys all next time.
[331.30s -> 333.30s]  So take care, everybody.
