[0.31s -> 16.86s]  Hey, what's going on guys? Jerma here. Mmm, with some SCP 087b. Kind of a mouthful, I know.
[16.86s -> 23.86s]  But this is kind of an offshoot or a spin-off of the first SCP game I played a couple weeks ago.
[23.86s -> 28.86s]  And it was heavily heavily requested. A lot of you guys, when you saw that I did 087, you said,
[28.86s -> 35.86s]  Do 087b. It's much more scary, much more ridiculous. So I said okay. I also did Containment Breach.
[35.86s -> 43.86s]  So I think this wraps up all the SCP games. Maybe I'll play them again, but I think this should wrap it up in regards to SCP games.
[43.86s -> 48.29s]  I might be totally wrong. If there are more, let me know. I will absolutely play them.
[48.29s -> 60.40s]  But let's get this going here. SCP 087b. Sort of along the lines of the first one where it was a staircase simulator.
[60.40s -> 69.21s]  But this one has hallways too, I guess. And brick hallways that were created by the Romans. That's not true.
[69.21s -> 75.45s]  But this is trying to find ways to make myself happier right now because I'm about to be very scared.
[75.45s -> 87.10s]  Floor 2. What the hell was that? Already? Are you serious? No way. Already there's going to be something like that?
[87.10s -> 96.74s]  There were eyes just peering at me. I don't even want to go down here. There were two eyes just looking right at me.
[96.74s -> 113.98s]  I don't want to go down this hallway. Whatever. He's not there anymore. He went to go eat breakfast. Floor 3.
[113.98s -> 127.03s]  Oh, they're already going to throw stuff like that at me. What? Oh, okay. Wait, hold on. Is this like a maze or something? I can't even see.
[127.03s -> 150.53s]  No? Okay. I know. Stop doing that. Every time I see that, like, pair of eyes. Five.
[150.53s -> 169.93s]  Roger that. Six. Goddamn.
[171.55s -> 196.22s]  I wonder how many octaves I can make. What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? I'm blocked off?
[196.22s -> 207.87s]  What is that? Why is it like a peephole right here? I don't understand. Maybe the guy was like peeping on me or something. That's weird.
[207.87s -> 219.47s]  It's very weird. Very weird. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
[221.16s -> 230.02s]  That was a fail. Should I turn around? I don't know if I should turn around. He's going to come get me.
[230.02s -> 243.82s]  Maybe this is what this is for. To, like, see him coming to get you. I can't even turn around. You have to face your fears, right?
[243.82s -> 262.98s]  Is he, like, coming? I wish I could, like, peer through and see. I just want to be your friend. I just want to be your friend.
[262.98s -> 279.21s]  I think he's gone. I think I escaped that dude. He, like, spit on me or something. I got, like, an acid brain.
[279.21s -> 294.49s]  I was like, eeeh. That's going to happen again, and I'm not going to escape next time. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Hello. Hi.
[294.49s -> 308.90s]  There's another one. Okay. Last time there was one of these, like, peeping little holes, that dude showed up.
[308.90s -> 321.22s]  Let's see if it happens again. There he is. There he is. Where is he? Where is he? Where is he? Oh, my God.
[321.22s -> 352.81s]  Still alive. I don't know how much longer I can do this for. Okay. What's that? What's going on? What is going on? What is going on? What is going on? What is going on? What is going on?
[352.81s -> 373.57s]  What's going on? What is making that noise? What is making that noise? What is that? What is that thing? Is that, like, a- Oh, my God.
[373.57s -> 395.40s]  Oh, my God. The question is, do I run? I don't know where to go. Should I turn around and just run? Screw it. Come at me, bro! Come at me, bro!
