[0.31s -> 13.20s]  Meltdown. Battle of Chistan Cliffs, Pakistan. One in the chamber.
[13.20s -> 18.20s]  Hey, what's going on guys? Jerma here with One in the Chamber, just said the name of the game mode.
[18.20s -> 22.70s]  This is going to be a live commentary of me messing around on One in the Chamber, which if you don't know what this is,
[22.70s -> 32.74s]  well this is Call of Duty Black Ops 2, where you only get one bullet, kind of like the golden gun in 007.
[33.24s -> 38.74s]  One shot kill. If you kill somebody, you get your bullet back. And you get three lives.
[40.18s -> 44.70s]  So, let's...come here you son of a bitch!
[45.70s -> 47.70s]  You can also knife people as well. As you just...
[48.20s -> 49.20s]  Damn it!
[51.19s -> 55.37s]  Alright, I gotta be careful here. I only got one life. I'm on my final life.
[58.58s -> 61.88s]  I'm gonna get smoked. I'm gonna get smoked.
[62.38s -> 66.08s]  There's a guy right here. Get out of my face!
[66.08s -> 69.08s]  Come on, I got this guy right here. There's a dude right here. A dude right here in this door.
[69.58s -> 71.82s]  Come here you. Come here you.
[71.82s -> 72.82s]  What?!
[72.82s -> 73.82s]  Oh, he...
[73.82s -> 74.82s]  Yeah!
[74.82s -> 76.82s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
[76.82s -> 81.43s]  Where they at? Where are they?
[81.43s -> 82.67s]  He's right here.
[82.67s -> 83.67s]  I'm scared!
[83.67s -> 84.67s]  Oh, get...
[84.67s -> 85.67s]  No! No!
[85.67s -> 89.67s]  Oh, that guy just scared the absolute crap out of me. He just like jumped in the air like...
[90.67s -> 92.67s]  And I missed. Ah, I should have aimed down sights.
[92.67s -> 93.67s]  Damn it!
[93.67s -> 98.38s]  Carrier. Location classified.
[98.38s -> 100.38s]  One in the Chamber.
[100.38s -> 101.38s]  Let's do it again.
[101.38s -> 104.20s]  Got my golden gun.
[104.20s -> 110.34s]  Four, three, two, one, go!
[110.34s -> 115.68s]  Who...
[115.68s -> 117.86s]  Who wants it? Who wants it? There's a guy right here.
[117.86s -> 119.99s]  It's this guy.
[119.99s -> 120.99s]  Oh!
[120.99s -> 122.49s]  What?! No!
[122.49s -> 123.49s]  There's a guy behind me!
[123.49s -> 125.50s]  What?!
[125.50s -> 126.93s]  What?!
[126.93s -> 127.93s]  Yeah!
[129.62s -> 130.62s]  Alright, gotta get my bearings here.
[131.62s -> 132.62s]  Get out of my face!
[138.08s -> 139.38s]  Excuse me, sir.
[139.38s -> 141.56s]  I'm gonna get you.
[141.56s -> 142.56s]  I got you!
[142.56s -> 144.56s]  I got you! I told you I was gonna get you!
[144.56s -> 147.82s]  Watch that UAV. Watch that UAV.
[148.32s -> 149.95s]  Behind me.
[149.95s -> 150.95s]  Yeah!
[150.95s -> 153.21s]  Oh, this guy.
[153.21s -> 154.21s]  You wanna play a knife fight?
[154.21s -> 155.21s]  You wanna play?
[155.21s -> 157.73s]  You wanna go for a knife?
[157.73s -> 158.73s]  No!
[158.73s -> 160.73s]  Oh, I saw that guy.
[160.73s -> 163.04s]  If I was a split second earlier.
[163.04s -> 164.04s]  It's alright.
[164.04s -> 165.04s]  That's only one death.
[165.04s -> 167.11s]  That's only one death.
[167.11s -> 168.11s]  I'm good.
[168.11s -> 170.73s]  It's so nerve-racking.
[170.73s -> 175.07s]  This guy up here.
[175.07s -> 177.24s]  Be careful.
[177.24s -> 179.24s]  Don't make any noise.
[179.24s -> 180.48s]  What?
[180.48s -> 181.48s]  Oh!
[181.48s -> 182.48s]  Get it!
[182.48s -> 183.48s]  Where's he?
[183.48s -> 185.48s]  Come here.
[185.98s -> 186.98s]  He's right here.
[186.98s -> 191.90s]  Where's the son of a bitch?
[191.90s -> 192.90s]  Why is this guy?
[192.90s -> 194.39s]  Did he die?
[194.39s -> 195.39s]  Oh, now I really am scared.
[195.39s -> 197.21s]  No!
[197.21s -> 198.21s]  No!
[198.21s -> 199.21s]  No!
[199.21s -> 201.98s]  No!
[201.98s -> 202.98s]  No!
[202.98s -> 203.98s]  Freak out!
[206.89s -> 207.89s]  That guy got behind me.
[207.89s -> 208.89s]  Damn it!
[208.89s -> 209.89s]  Alright, I'm in like the...
[209.89s -> 211.89s]  I think I'm in like the leaderboard here.
[211.89s -> 213.89s]  If I can just stay alive.
[213.89s -> 216.58s]  Yeah, there's only one or two guys left.
[216.58s -> 217.58s]  Come on.
[217.58s -> 218.58s]  Let me pull this win out.
[218.58s -> 222.76s]  Where's this guy?
[222.76s -> 223.76s]  Where's this asshole?
[223.76s -> 225.38s]  Oh, there he is.
[225.38s -> 226.38s]  There he is.
[226.38s -> 227.38s]  He doesn't have a shot.
[227.88s -> 229.12s]  Can I end it right here?
[229.12s -> 230.12s]  Oh!
[230.12s -> 231.12s]  Can I end it right here?
[231.12s -> 232.12s]  That's a question.
[232.12s -> 233.12s]  That's a real question at hand.
[233.12s -> 236.60s]  He's coming around.
[236.60s -> 237.60s]  He's coming around.
[237.60s -> 238.60s]  Oh, no.
[238.60s -> 239.60s]  He's coming back.
[239.60s -> 241.42s]  He's coming back.
[241.42s -> 242.42s]  Oh, this is so scary.
[242.42s -> 245.07s]  No!
[245.07s -> 246.07s]  He missed.
[246.07s -> 247.07s]  Yeah!
[247.07s -> 248.50s]  Oh!
[248.50s -> 249.50s]  Murder...
[249.50s -> 250.68s]  Oh, I forgot my name was Murder She Wrote.
[250.68s -> 254.68s]  If anybody knows what that is, Murder She Wrote was an old TV show in the 80s.
[254.68s -> 257.17s]  My grandmother used to watch it.
[257.17s -> 258.80s]  Oh, look at this knife right here.
[258.80s -> 259.80s]  Look at this.
[259.80s -> 260.80s]  Oh, side step!
[260.80s -> 265.35s]  Apparently, I knifed his back.
[265.85s -> 266.85s]  Or...
[266.85s -> 267.85s]  I don't even know what I just knifed.
[267.85s -> 269.54s]  That was weird.
[269.54s -> 270.54s]  All right.
[270.54s -> 271.54s]  One more.
[271.54s -> 273.35s]  One more run.
[273.35s -> 274.35s]  Let's do it.
[274.35s -> 275.35s]  One more time.
[275.35s -> 276.35s]  All right.
[276.35s -> 277.35s]  Let's do a repeat last time.
[277.35s -> 279.30s]  Let me get top frag like a boss.
[279.30s -> 280.30s]  Five.
[280.30s -> 281.30s]  Four.
[281.30s -> 282.30s]  Three.
[282.30s -> 283.47s]  Two.
[283.47s -> 286.63s]  One.
[286.63s -> 289.54s]  Go.
[289.54s -> 290.54s]  Let's go up top.
[290.54s -> 292.80s]  Get in here.
[292.80s -> 294.36s]  Anybody?
[294.36s -> 295.36s]  Anybody?
[295.36s -> 296.36s]  Anybody?
[296.36s -> 297.36s]  What does that noise even mean?
[297.36s -> 298.36s]  That thing scares the...
[298.36s -> 299.98s]  What?
[299.98s -> 300.98s]  What?
[300.98s -> 303.98s]  That didn't make any sense at all.
[303.98s -> 305.48s]  I knifed that guy right in his teeth.
[305.48s -> 309.30s]  Oh, we got a guy coming up right here.
[310.30s -> 311.30s]  What?
[311.30s -> 312.30s]  No!
[312.30s -> 313.30s]  That's not fair.
[313.30s -> 314.30s]  It's not fair.
[314.30s -> 315.30s]  It's not fair.
[315.30s -> 323.32s]  I shot that guy in his wrist.
[323.32s -> 325.52s]  Boink!
[325.52s -> 327.02s]  I got him.
[327.02s -> 328.02s]  How did I get that guy?
[328.02s -> 329.02s]  Holy God.
[329.02s -> 330.02s]  I didn't even hit that guy.
[330.02s -> 333.02s]  I shot like 10 feet to that guy's right.
[333.02s -> 334.02s]  Behind me.
[334.02s -> 336.84s]  I'm on my last life here.
[336.84s -> 339.72s]  I've got to be real careful.
[339.72s -> 346.41s]  I can't screw around.
[346.41s -> 349.42s]  Up top this way.
[351.12s -> 352.12s]  Watch that UAV.
[352.12s -> 353.12s]  There's a guy right here.
[353.12s -> 354.55s]  See ya.
[357.65s -> 358.89s]  Anybody else?
[358.89s -> 359.89s]  Check that UAV.
[362.98s -> 363.98s]  Yo!
[364.98s -> 368.25s]  Oh, I air knifed him.
[368.25s -> 371.00s]  One guy over here as well.
[371.00s -> 376.31s]  Come here, you.
[376.31s -> 379.90s]  He doesn't know where I am.
[379.90s -> 382.14s]  What?
[382.14s -> 383.14s]  Ready?
[383.14s -> 385.15s]  Watch this.
[385.15s -> 386.15s]  Super knife!
[386.15s -> 387.15s]  Oh, it's all about the knife.
[387.15s -> 388.15s]  It's all about the knife.
[390.15s -> 391.15s]  Oh, I would've won it.
[391.15s -> 392.15s]  I would've won it right there.
[392.15s -> 393.15s]  Damn.
[394.53s -> 395.53s]  Oh well, well.
[395.53s -> 396.90s]  This mode is a lot of fun.
[396.90s -> 401.90s]  If you don't know how to do this if you have Black Ops 2, you go to party games.
[401.90s -> 403.90s]  And that was me that died right there, by the way.
[403.90s -> 406.90s]  You go to party games and it's one in the chamber.
[406.90s -> 407.90s]  So thank you guys so much for watching.
[407.90s -> 408.90s]  I really do appreciate it.
[408.90s -> 410.90s]  And I'll see you guys all soon.
[410.90s -> 412.90s]  And of course, take care everybody.
[412.90s -> 413.90s]  Murder, she wrote.
