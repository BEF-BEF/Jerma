[0.31s -> 12.31s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a little gem.
[12.31s -> 18.31s]  This week's little gem is going to be one of my favorites, and I actually used to play this game all the time,
[18.31s -> 22.31s]  almost every single day, back a couple years ago when it was just a flash game.
[22.31s -> 29.31s]  But now, it has been ported to the iPad. It got ported last year, and it's definitely one of my absolute favorites.
[29.31s -> 34.31s]  The name of the game is Cursed Treasure, or Cursed Treasure, I'm not sure which one of those you want to say,
[34.31s -> 41.62s]  but Cursed Treasure HD. This is a tower defense game, and probably the best tower defense game I've ever played.
[41.62s -> 47.62s]  There's so much to this game, there's so much depth in such a tiny little package, you have to have this game.
[47.62s -> 53.86s]  Now, unfortunately, my Blackmagic Intensity that I just got in the mail, it won't pick up my iPad,
[53.86s -> 57.86s]  which is kind of unfortunate because that's the reason why I bought the Blackmagic Intensity,
[57.86s -> 63.86s]  but I will figure that out in the meantime. These two versions are pretty much identical, minus the touch features.
[63.86s -> 68.03s]  So the way this game plays is kind of like any other tower defense game out there.
[68.03s -> 75.03s]  You build towers to stop waves of creeps from taking something that is yours, and what is yours are these five gems.
[75.03s -> 81.34s]  If all five of those leave, you lose the game. It's pretty standard when it comes to tower defense,
[81.34s -> 86.34s]  you just build, you kill, and that's it. But, but, but, but, but, there's a major but here.
[86.34s -> 92.34s]  After every round, you're going to get experience points, and this is something I never see tower defense games do,
[92.34s -> 98.51s]  which gives me this urge to play it a million times. There are skill points in this game,
[98.51s -> 103.69s]  and there are skilled trees in this game. You level up. You actually level up in this game,
[103.69s -> 107.69s]  and then you use the points to make your towers better in the three various trees.
[107.69s -> 113.69s]  Each tree is totally different. You can play through this game three times, totally,
[113.69s -> 119.69s]  and get a different experience each time you play. And the simplicity of it all will really take you by surprise.
[119.69s -> 126.86s]  There's only three towers in this entire game. You don't get 50 towers or 12 different towers to choose from.
[126.86s -> 131.86s]  There's only three, and each one corresponds to a different skill tree.
[131.86s -> 138.30s]  But there is a twist. You can only build these towers on the corresponding land that they are allowed.
[138.30s -> 141.30s]  For instance, you can only build the green towers on the green grass.
[141.30s -> 147.30s]  You can only build the crypt towers on the snow, and the red towers can only go on the red clay.
[147.30s -> 151.30s]  So you have to do a lot of strategy, and you have to really figure out what towers you're going to use,
[151.30s -> 156.66s]  and they have to work in tandem, which brings me to the difficulty of this game.
[156.66s -> 161.84s]  Once you get past the first five to ten levels, you'll start losing gems more often than not,
[161.84s -> 164.84s]  and you might have to go back and rework your build.
[164.84s -> 170.08s]  I can't believe I'm actually saying the word build in a tower defense game, but that is the honest-to-god truth.
[170.08s -> 174.08s]  You have to have a good build, and you have to really work to your play style.
[174.08s -> 178.08s]  Maybe you don't like the slow, slug tower of the crypt.
[178.08s -> 181.08s]  Maybe you want the fast-beaming, low-DPS tower of the fire.
[181.08s -> 185.08s]  And maybe you want to go maybe in between. You want to have the orc tower and the crypt tower.
[185.08s -> 186.08s]  There's a lot to it.
[186.08s -> 190.45s]  One thing I did not talk about yet are the mana abilities in this game.
[190.45s -> 192.45s]  There are three, just like there are three towers.
[192.45s -> 196.45s]  You generate mana as you play, and you can pick one of these three moves.
[196.45s -> 200.45s]  One of them is chopping down trees to put more towers down, which is incredibly useful.
[200.45s -> 203.45s]  The second one is a burn move, so to speak.
[203.45s -> 207.45s]  It's to make all your towers shoot 200% faster for a small duration.
[207.45s -> 212.75s]  And the last one is just a meteor of death that you drop and will kill pretty much anything it lands on.
[212.75s -> 215.75s]  You're going to be using these moves a ton during your playthrough.
[215.75s -> 219.75s]  They don't just sit idling in your little corner there. You use them all the damn time.
[219.75s -> 226.42s]  So the fun factor of this game, and the reason why you should get it, here is a very personal quick story.
[226.42s -> 233.42s]  So a lot of you that are old subscribers might remember I had jury duty like seven or eight months ago, a long time ago.
[233.42s -> 237.42s]  So I wanted to make sure I was prepared for this, so the night before I downloaded a couple of games.
[237.42s -> 244.42s]  This was one of the games I downloaded, and is the only one I downloaded that lasted me six hours straight.
[244.42s -> 252.79s]  Because if you don't know jury duty, they put you in a room with a bunch of people, and they may or may not call you to be a citizen.
[252.79s -> 259.79s]  But the awful part is you could be sitting there all damn day, which is what happened to me.
[259.79s -> 265.79s]  I got there at about eleven o'clock, and I left at about four or five thirty, which really really sucked.
[265.79s -> 270.79s]  But at the same time, this game made it a little more tolerable as each hour went by.
[270.79s -> 274.97s]  So that's going to wrap up the video, guys. Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[274.97s -> 281.97s]  And if you're wondering about the price, this game is currently $2.99 on the App Store, and it's only for the iPad, as of right now.
[281.97s -> 285.97s]  You can also play this for Windows or Mac if you have Flash installed.
[285.97s -> 291.97s]  You cannot go to the link in the description and play this on an iPad or an iPhone, because they don't have Flash.
[291.97s -> 296.14s]  So again, I'll see you all soon, and take care, everybody.
