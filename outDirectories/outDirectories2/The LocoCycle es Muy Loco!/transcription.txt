[0.31s -> 21.00s]  Is that... is that Freddy Rodriguez? That's Freddy Rodriguez! What the hell is going on?
[25.67s -> 32.39s]  Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa easy. That's dangerous. Oh shit, he's gonna hatch it. He's gonna hatch it.
[34.07s -> 34.63s]  Suplex.
[39.03s -> 45.67s]  That was... that was awesome. I ain't gonna lie. You can't deny that suplexing somebody off a
[45.67s -> 53.85s]  motorcycle isn't pretty damn cool, okay? Just get these guys out of the way. Get out of my face.
[54.49s -> 65.10s]  A couple more pieces of health. Nice. Whoa, there's another one up here. If I can get through one a
[65.10s -> 73.29s]  minute, then I should be fine. Did you see that burger? That was a ridiculous looking burger on
[73.29s -> 81.48s]  that billboard. It was like six patties on that hamburger. That was insane. Now I want a hamburger.
[81.48s -> 92.31s]  Great. What the fuck just happened? What? I don't know what... I don't know what happened.
[92.87s -> 101.58s]  The thing just freaked out and flew off the cliff. Move, move, move, move. I only have 54 seconds.
[104.71s -> 112.02s]  I only have 54 seconds. Get me up there. Come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[117.74s -> 124.62s]  It did it again. It didn't... why is it doing that? Why is it doing that?
[124.70s -> 132.17s]  What? I'm gonna fail the mission. No, no, I'm back. He's back. You see that? He just teleported from
[132.17s -> 137.77s]  the right side of the screen. Wow, that was really stupid. I hope you guys got to see that.
[137.77s -> 152.97s]  That was unbelievable. Thank God, dude. That was ridiculous. Speaking of ridiculous,
[154.39s -> 160.65s]  the car just got sucked up by a spaceship. They put a tractor beam on that fucking thing.
[161.53s -> 172.30s]  I got an F. Fuck you with the F. Maybe if your stupid trucks weren't driving off the side of the
[172.30s -> 179.10s]  road, I wouldn't have to restart the thing three or four goddamn times. You wanna talk about a quick
[179.10s -> 185.10s]  time? You wanna talk about a quick time? You wanna talk about quick time? Press A, quick time. Press
[185.10s -> 189.90s]  B, looking for the quick time. Come out at your quick time. Helicopter, don't worry, quick time.
[189.90s -> 194.46s]  Gonna turn right, looking for the quick time. I ain't seeing more, right? Quick time. Helicopter,
[194.46s -> 199.26s]  quick time. Come back, quick time. What you wanna do? Wanna go, quick time. Wanna find a way,
[199.26s -> 203.42s]  do some quick time. Ain't no other way for that quick time. Coming at you, quick time.
[206.17s -> 222.58s]  Oh, road rash. Whoa. What the hell? Oh, damn. Are we really watching this?
[223.72s -> 231.06s]  Coming soon to theaters. Cars 3, colon. Motorcycles, a love story. Rated X.
[234.79s -> 244.07s]  Dude, this guy is just on a rampage right now. Are you serious? What a dick. These innocent people
[244.07s -> 250.94s]  did nothing wrong and you just caused like a seven car pileup. Just for what? Because you're mad at
[250.94s -> 257.45s]  her for like being like too pretty or something? Like what's your problem? And now you just blew
[257.45s -> 261.37s]  up a perfectly good oil tanker. That company's gonna lose out on thousands of dollars.
[263.78s -> 276.12s]  I know this trick. What, you think I'm stupid? You don't think I've never seen
[276.12s -> 280.70s]  homing missiles shot at me before? Your buddies have been doing this all game
[280.70s -> 285.43s]  and look what happened. All your secret agent buddies have been shooting homing,
[285.43s -> 289.75s]  slow homing missiles at me and look where it got them. You probably should have taken a note
[289.75s -> 294.15s]  about that before you came after Marie. Marie. You probably should have taken a note before you
[294.15s -> 304.01s]  came after Marie. Oh, I'm on fire mode. On fire mode. Ooh, counter attack. Hello, sweetheart.
[304.01s -> 310.87s]  What's going on, Master Chief? You're in the wrong game, Master Chief. Don't you know you
[310.87s -> 315.59s]  can't fuck with the Batmobile game thing with the flaming wheels from Disney Pixar?
[316.79s -> 324.52s]  Master Chief and your buddy Boba Fett Chief, you're all a bunch of fucking clowns.
[325.96s -> 331.24s]  Halo 5 ain't even coming out this year. Haven't you read the fucking news?
[331.24s -> 337.58s]  Halo 5 ain't gonna be out for like another 10 years. We got the Power Rangers behind us.
[338.46s -> 345.90s]  We got, who's the Red Power Ranger? Tommy? And the Green Ranger? No, the Green Ranger was Tommy.
[345.90s -> 353.43s]  And the Red was, what was the Red Power Ranger's name? I don't remember. Henry? All right, well
[353.43s -> 361.98s]  Henry's dead. Tommy, well, all the Tommy clones are dead now. Hopefully they don't morph into like
[361.98s -> 368.46s]  Pterodactyls and T-Rexes and shit. One Power Ranger had a terrible, terrible transformation.
[368.46s -> 372.22s]  Do you remember in the Power Rangers movie, the one Power Ranger that had the frog
[373.02s -> 380.84s]  and he was pissed? I'd be pissed too. If my power, you know, T-Rex, Pterodactyl, Tiger, Lion, Frog.
[380.84s -> 390.02s]  Yeah, that would suck. I want to be the Tiger. I don't want to be a frog. What am I talking about?
