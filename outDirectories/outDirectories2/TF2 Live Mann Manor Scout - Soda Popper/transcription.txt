[1.98s -> 10.62s]  Hey, what is going on, you ghouls and ghosts? It's me, Jerma, from the past or the future.
[10.62s -> 16.46s]  No, I'm kind of just here in the present. But we're on Man Manor tonight for a live commentary,
[16.46s -> 18.94s]  getting in the Halloween spirit more and more every day.
[19.58s -> 25.10s]  Seems like everybody is playing this map, by the way. Everybody's playing Man Manor to get themselves
[25.10s -> 29.18s]  pumped for the Halloween update, and to get themselves pumped in general for Halloween,
[29.18s -> 35.50s]  which is awesome. If you are unfamiliar, this map is the Halloween update map from last year.
[35.50s -> 39.90s]  It's got like, you know, pieces of pie, pumpkin pie, like candy and stuff like that. It's all
[39.90s -> 45.11s]  over the place. And where is everybody? Kind of weird. Getting on the point right now.
[45.11s -> 51.66s]  All right, there's plenty of people on each team. Uh-oh, Angie. Oh, I'm done. I'm dead. Maybe I'm
[51.66s -> 56.70s]  dead. So this is the update map, like I said, everyone's playing it. This is the map where
[56.70s -> 62.92s]  this huge boss comes out. If you haven't played this map, play it at least in the next couple
[62.92s -> 66.84s]  days or the next week or something like that, because it's very, very fun. See, look at everything.
[66.84s -> 72.28s]  It's like candy and stuff. Mm, delicious candy. Whoa, I'm being an idiot. Not paying any attention.
[72.28s -> 78.33s]  Let's go. Bring it on, Pierrot. Let's go, Mr. Pierrot. Oh, you're going to get away, are you?
[78.33s -> 84.26s]  No, you are not. Give me that help. Oh, we got crits, baby. Oh, don't you jump in here
[85.14s -> 91.27s]  Oh, God. Speaking of crits, he has... Oh, God. All right, we got it. We got it. Let's get on it.
[91.27s -> 97.29s]  So yeah, a giant boss will appear. He's the headless, haunted headless horseman. Hold on,
[97.29s -> 102.74s]  let me get this right. He is the horseless headless horseman. There we go. He appears and he
[102.74s -> 108.76s]  just melee one hit kills every single person. It's awesome. It can get really, really annoying,
[108.76s -> 115.08s]  though. I will say that it can get fairly obnoxious if you're trying to play. Let's say you're like
[115.80s -> 121.24s]  a great round. It's like, oh, I just killed 12 people. Oh, here comes the frigging monster
[121.24s -> 127.53s]  that's going to kill us all. It's like, great. That's exactly what I needed. Oh, God. Here we go.
[127.53s -> 133.77s]  We're doing all right. Let's keep moving. Let's keep moving. Oh, crit bomb. Crit bomb. Oh, come on
[133.77s -> 143.29s]  now. Oh, he got away. I'm actually going to... I'm at the last point. Oh, they got a teleporter.
[143.29s -> 153.14s]  I'm going to sneak on them. And there it goes. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. Get that candy.
[154.23s -> 160.31s]  So if you guys were wondering what I was being for Halloween, me and a couple of other buddies
[160.31s -> 167.19s]  are going to die. We're going to be the ninja turtles for Halloween. So it should be very,
[167.19s -> 173.35s]  very fun. We have like a whole huge getup already made. It's going to be crazy. Oh, he got the candy.
[174.15s -> 179.35s]  Oh, damn. It's going to be pretty crazy. We're being the ninja turtles, all four ninja turtles,
[179.35s -> 184.90s]  and one of our other friends is going to be Splinter. So we're going to go out into the town,
[184.90s -> 190.10s]  probably go into downtown Boston. Be crazy. Have some fun. Just like how you should on Halloween.
[191.06s -> 195.06s]  Don't get too crazy though. You know, don't let go egg in somebody's house or something,
[195.06s -> 199.46s]  because that's not cool. Where am I going? I keep on going way past the point.
[200.63s -> 206.38s]  And I keep on forgetting to not switch this. Oh, there he is. Oh, my God. There he is.
[206.94s -> 211.61s]  There he is. See, if you've never seen him before, there he is. He's running around
[211.61s -> 215.99s]  chasing somebody. I want to get a good look at him. Where is he? Oh, there he is.
[217.08s -> 223.88s]  And if you kill him with a melee kill, you get this. Oh, God, I'm it. He's coming after me now.
[223.88s -> 230.04s]  Let's see if I can just start smashing him. Oh, God. Pretty much this is where they got the idea
[230.04s -> 236.04s]  for the Saxton Hale mod. So if you're a fan of the Saxton Hale mod, this is pretty much its roots,
[236.04s -> 240.44s]  because people said, wow, that's pretty funny. And that's pretty fun. What if that person was
[240.44s -> 246.30s]  player controlled? And that's, I guess, where Saxton Hale was kind of born, the mod. So let's
[246.30s -> 253.85s]  get on. Can we even cap this point before I end this gameplay? Apparently not. Oh, lag. Lag.
[256.60s -> 259.64s]  So yeah, what are you guys doing for Halloween? Have you guys figured out what you were doing yet?
[261.14s -> 264.82s]  I'm kind of wondering, because I know some of you guys gave me your ideas, and some of them
[264.82s -> 275.91s]  were actually pretty good. Some, oh, God. Oh, what? What the hell? Did he just rage DC? What was that?
[278.18s -> 286.07s]  Oh, I got to get him. He doesn't even know where I am. He doesn't even know where I am.
[289.74s -> 297.99s]  All right, we got the point. We got it. Let's go. Oh, boy. Oh, can I get it? Can I get it?
[297.99s -> 305.61s]  Keep moving. Keep moving. Keep moving. Give me those crits. Give me those mini crits. All right.
[306.17s -> 314.46s]  We're good to go. Oh, my God. Out of nowhere. Oh, you want to go melee up in here? You want to
[314.46s -> 321.18s]  go melee up in here? Oh, boy. Somebody's spamming from somewhere. That soldier. Come on. Keep me
[321.18s -> 326.50s]  alive. Where's the candy? Where's the candy? Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Come on, Captain. Come on.
[326.50s -> 335.37s]  Come on. I don't have much time. Not much time. Oh, give me that. Give me that thing. We got it.
[336.28s -> 347.26s]  We got this. Haunted gift. There we go. Blow up that stuff. Oh, my God. Sentry and a spy.
[347.26s -> 355.56s]  I got an achievement. Nice. A taco lantern. I think we're about to win this game. But yeah,
[355.56s -> 360.60s]  the Halloween update is supposed to come out, I think, either tomorrow or the next day. Today is
[360.60s -> 366.94s]  Tuesday. So yeah, it should be exciting. I saw the pyro face thing with the horns and the wings.
[367.50s -> 373.35s]  That's going to be pretty ridiculous. Hopefully, hopefully, they add some of that crazy stuff and
[373.35s -> 378.09s]  we get some... Oh, hey, what's going on, sniper? Hopefully, they add some crazy stuff. I want new
[378.09s -> 383.61s]  weapons. Like I said, I want new weapons. New weapons. Oh, let's do some dancing. Let's do
[383.61s -> 388.66s]  some dancing. Oh, give me that. It's over. If I can get... If I pick this up, it's pretty much over.
[388.66s -> 396.18s]  Oh, it's over. It's over. Oh, might as well taunt. Oh, my God. Get it. No.
[398.58s -> 404.47s]  Oh, you got to be kidding. We got it. Nice. And top frag. Cool. But yeah, hopefully,
[404.47s -> 409.51s]  you guys have a good safe Halloween. I got a very special video going up in the next couple days. So
[410.31s -> 413.83s]  I'll see you guys all next time. Take care, everybody.
