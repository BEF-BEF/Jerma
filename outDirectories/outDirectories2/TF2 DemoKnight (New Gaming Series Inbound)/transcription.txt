[1.78s -> 6.82s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[6.82s -> 12.44s]  This is gonna be a demo man with the demo night setup. This is just a quick little prelude.
[12.44s -> 17.48s]  I got a bunch of multi-kills in a row. Just wanted to briefly show them before we got into the actual
[17.48s -> 22.52s]  gameplay. The actual gameplay is like three and a half minutes or something, and you guys all know
[22.52s -> 28.36s]  me. I do not like having less than three or four five minute gameplays, which is why this is here.
[28.36s -> 34.38s]  And I gotta ask, how was your Christmas? Hope you got what you wanted, hope you gave some things
[34.38s -> 39.10s]  to your friends and family as well, because it's not just about getting, it's about giving guys.
[39.66s -> 44.70s]  And the only real holiday that's left in the year is New Year's Eve. And New Year's Eve, if you're
[44.70s -> 51.42s]  over 21, New Year's Eve potentially is the best holiday of the year. Only because there is so
[51.42s -> 56.30s]  much stuff going on, so many parties, so many bars are open really late, it's just awesome.
[56.30s -> 60.94s]  And even if you're under 21, even if you're not old enough to drink and go to a bar, it's still
[60.94s -> 65.90s]  just as fun. You get to stay up wicked late, hang out with your friends, watch the ball drop, it is
[65.90s -> 72.86s]  magical. So anyways, I want to talk about a couple of things in this gameplay. I'm not going to really
[72.86s -> 77.19s]  talk about what's going on, because as a demo night, you can't really talk about a whole lot.
[77.19s -> 81.99s]  You just bullet train people in the face, smash them with your sword, and rinse and repeat. There's
[81.99s -> 86.71s]  not really a whole lot to it. I top frag in this gameplay, but you know, that's, you can pay
[86.71s -> 91.80s]  attention if you want. I want to talk about a new series I want to try and do. A lot of people are
[91.80s -> 96.04s]  familiar with indie showcases, where, oh, here's an indie game, here's how you play it, there's
[96.04s -> 101.24s]  little things about it. Indie showcase. I kind of want to take that another step. I want to do a,
[101.24s -> 107.08s]  not really an indie showcase, an unknown showcase. Take a game that not very many people know about,
[107.08s -> 112.20s]  not very many people play, and it doesn't necessarily have to be an indie game. It can be
[112.20s -> 116.60s]  an older game that maybe everyone has forgotten at this point, or maybe a game that came out
[116.60s -> 122.04s]  recently that nobody really cared about. But it's probably good. So that's my plan, sort of. I want
[122.04s -> 128.20s]  to do this unknown series, or unknown showcase, or something. I'm not sure what the title will be yet.
[128.20s -> 132.28s]  Probably won't be more than once or twice a month. Maybe not even more than once a month. I'm not
[132.28s -> 136.92s]  sure. I haven't figured it out yet. But we could probably turn it into a community project. That's
[136.92s -> 142.04s]  kind of the future of the series. I see it as, you know some cool games that maybe not all your
[142.04s -> 146.28s]  friends know about. Maybe you just found it the other day, but I would like to know about it.
[146.28s -> 150.68s]  So we could start this community project where we share all these games with each other,
[150.68s -> 154.20s]  and it'll be great for everybody. Because we can all, oh I heard of this game. I heard of that game.
[154.20s -> 158.84s]  You should really do the video on it. Try and get as many people involved as possible. Because a lot
[158.84s -> 165.16s]  of these older games guys, especially for PC, if you're going back to like 1995 or something,
[165.16s -> 169.80s]  they can be pretty difficult to find. Like vaporware. That's what they call it. And also speaking
[169.80s -> 175.08s]  of PC, some of the older titles that had servers that were multiplayer, I'm sure nobody plays them
[175.08s -> 179.32s]  anymore. So how cool would it be if we got everybody in one of these servers and made an
[179.32s -> 184.20s]  entire game out of it? I just wanted to throw this out there. Wanted to see what you guys had
[184.20s -> 190.04s]  to think about it. Probably going to start this with the Neverhood. If any of you know what the
[190.04s -> 195.80s]  Neverhood is, I love you to death. And if you don't know what the Neverhood is, you are going
[195.80s -> 200.60s]  to find out in the next couple of days. Because that's what I'm going to do the first one. So look
[200.60s -> 205.56s]  for that on Friday. I'm assuming I'll have it done by Friday. Going to do a small showcase,
[205.56s -> 210.20s]  probably a five to six minute video. I'm not sure it'll take much longer than that. And the first
[210.20s -> 214.76s]  one, like I said, is going to be the Neverhood. The Neverhood is an adventure game for the PC.
[214.76s -> 221.16s]  Came out in 1995. It is made entirely out of claymation. It's one of the best games I've ever
[221.16s -> 226.76s]  played in my life. It's my childhood and it's great. So you can either wait for the showcase
[226.76s -> 231.96s]  this weekend or you can go do some research yourself. But let's talk about the gameplay now
[231.96s -> 237.48s]  for just a minute so I can give you one or two tips before the video is over. This is on King
[237.48s -> 243.48s]  of the Hill Lakeside, arguably the best demo night map in the game. Pretty much any King of the Hill
[243.48s -> 247.56s]  map, you'll have success with the demo night. Because there's so many places you can run around,
[247.56s -> 252.60s]  so many hiding spots. Not to mention people are literally all over the place because there's only
[252.60s -> 257.96s]  one point right in the middle. And really the only thing you have to worry about as a demo night on
[257.96s -> 261.96s]  a King of the Hill map is an engineer. Because most engineers are going to be running with the
[261.96s -> 267.56s]  mini sentry, which can really be horrible if you're playing demo night. If you charge somebody and
[267.56s -> 271.72s]  there's a mini sentry right near where you charged, you're in a lot of trouble because you can't
[271.72s -> 276.76s]  really get away and you're just sitting there taking hits over and over again and it'll eventually
[276.76s -> 281.64s]  kill you. A good way to go against that is to equip one of the grenade launchers and not have
[281.64s -> 287.88s]  the wee booties on. But in my opinion, I like to play demo night straight up full demo night,
[287.88s -> 292.68s]  which it actually does get me killed quite often. But I love the theory behind it. I love the
[292.68s -> 298.20s]  aesthetics. Like you have one item, you can only swing at people, that's all you can do.
[298.20s -> 302.20s]  And of course you can charge too, but it's just funny when you scroll through your weapons.
[302.20s -> 308.36s]  Nope, just got a melee item. It just makes me laugh every time. The only other real enemy you need to
[308.36s -> 313.40s]  be careful of is a pyro with a compression blast because they will just bounce you around and get
[313.40s -> 318.30s]  away from you. Other than that though, you can pretty much take anyone else. You get the jump on
[318.30s -> 323.26s]  somebody, doesn't matter who it is, you'll probably kill them. That's going to be the end of the video
[323.26s -> 328.06s]  guys. Thank you so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. Keep on the lookout for this new
[328.06s -> 333.82s]  unknown showcase I'm going to start doing and I'll see you guys all next time. Take care everybody.
