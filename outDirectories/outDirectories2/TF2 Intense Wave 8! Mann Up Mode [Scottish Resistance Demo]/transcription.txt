[0.31s -> 14.32s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[14.32s -> 20.32s]  Doing a lot of Team Fortress 2 the last couple of days, and that's because Man vs. Machine is just a ton of fun,
[20.32s -> 29.32s]  and especially this Man Up mode. And the only way you can get into a Man Up mode server is if you buy one of these Tour of Duty tickets.
[29.32s -> 35.32s]  They are 99 cents each, and these tickets allow you to not only play in the Man Up mode servers,
[35.32s -> 41.82s]  but after you complete one of these six missions, there's only six right now, you are going to consume that ticket,
[41.82s -> 47.82s]  and it's going to give you a random item. Now, you are definitely going to be playing for these items.
[47.82s -> 52.82s]  It is very, very difficult. As you'll see in this video, this is one of the most intense things ever,
[52.82s -> 57.82s]  that I've ever done in Team Fortress, or gaming in general. You're going to see some really intense moments here,
[57.82s -> 64.82s]  stuff that comes down to the absolute wire, and I believe Shibby has this on his channel as well if you want to see his perspective.
[65.63s -> 70.63s]  Just wanted to give this video a brief introduction. Playing on the map Decoy, this is wave 8 only,
[70.63s -> 76.00s]  and I hope you guys enjoy the chaos that is about to ensue. So thank you guys so much for watching,
[76.00s -> 80.00s]  we really do appreciate it, and enjoy the live commentary. Take care, everybody.
[106.52s -> 107.52s]  Go back and spend it.
[107.52s -> 108.76s]  Yeah.
[108.76s -> 115.53s]  Back, and crit boosts.
[115.53s -> 117.53s]  I haven't even got to shoot anybody yet with my sentry.
[117.53s -> 123.16s]  Oh, I got destroyed projectile. I can just keep shooting rockets. Nice.
[123.16s -> 124.16s]  Alright.
[124.16s -> 126.16s]  Oh shit.
[126.16s -> 131.15s]  How was that mover again? Demo.
[131.15s -> 132.15s]  Do you want it now?
[132.15s -> 134.15s]  No, don't use it. Hold on to it.
[134.15s -> 135.15s]  I need ammo.
[135.15s -> 136.15s]  That money.
[136.15s -> 137.15s]  Do it now.
[137.15s -> 138.52s]  That paper.
[138.52s -> 141.52s]  Pick up the ammo crate when you can.
[142.02s -> 146.02s]  Oh, these guys are all going to die when they step on that.
[146.02s -> 149.02s]  So that's not taking all the ammo from the dispensers?
[149.02s -> 151.02s]  Yeah, I'm shooting your rockets.
[151.02s -> 153.02s]  Very good, very good.
[153.02s -> 156.64s]  I haven't even got to kill anybody with the sentry yet.
[156.64s -> 158.07s]  Might as well.
[158.07s -> 159.07s]  Oh, that was dumb.
[159.07s -> 161.07s]  Here comes another super soldier.
[161.07s -> 162.07s]  That was dumb.
[162.07s -> 165.31s]  He's got all crits. Watch out.
[165.31s -> 167.62s]  Money steps on that.
[167.62s -> 169.62s]  Watch these rockets. I got it, I got it.
[169.62s -> 171.24s]  I need...
[171.74s -> 173.74s]  Here comes the con and the heavy.
[173.74s -> 174.74s]  Heavy with the medics.
[174.74s -> 175.74s]  You got crits?
[175.74s -> 177.92s]  Heavy with medics.
[177.92s -> 179.16s]  Oh boy.
[179.16s -> 181.16s]  Here he comes, here he comes.
[181.16s -> 182.16s]  Oh boy.
[182.16s -> 186.00s]  Oh, I died, I died. Shit.
[186.00s -> 188.00s]  What is he doing up here?
[188.00s -> 190.00s]  What is he doing up here?
[190.00s -> 191.00s]  Is there a path change?
[191.00s -> 194.07s]  I don't know, but we got to get rid of this tank.
[194.07s -> 197.59s]  Tank always goes left. You're good about that.
[197.59s -> 202.36s]  Oh man, there's bad news.
[202.36s -> 206.01s]  They're all over here. They're going up that right...
[206.01s -> 207.01s]  They're going to try and go up there with you.
[207.01s -> 209.01s]  I'm going to try and take the medics.
[209.51s -> 212.39s]  Oh, damn.
[212.39s -> 216.17s]  Medics are gone, medics are gone.
[216.17s -> 217.17s]  This heavy should go down.
[217.17s -> 218.17s]  He's dead.
[218.17s -> 219.47s]  Nice one.
[219.47s -> 220.47s]  Two snipers.
[220.47s -> 222.47s]  We got to get rid of this thing.
[222.47s -> 223.47s]  Oh, coming up again.
[223.47s -> 227.97s]  I am officially out of ammo.
[227.97s -> 232.13s]  Oh come on, step on that.
[232.13s -> 233.13s]  They're just walking over it.
[233.13s -> 234.56s]  This heavy's coming up onto it.
[234.56s -> 236.56s]  German, get rid of detonator on them.
[236.56s -> 237.93s]  Yep.
[237.93s -> 238.93s]  I'm waiting, I'm waiting for him.
[238.93s -> 239.93s]  I'm going to need help with this tank, guys.
[239.93s -> 240.93s]  Yeah, I'm here.
[240.93s -> 242.93s]  We got this heavy over here.
[242.93s -> 244.93s]  I don't think we're going to get it.
[245.43s -> 246.73s]  I'm coming back, I'm coming back.
[246.73s -> 247.73s]  I'm coming back.
[247.73s -> 249.23s]  Tank, tank, tank.
[249.23s -> 250.23s]  Oh no.
[250.23s -> 251.23s]  It's alright, we're here.
[251.23s -> 252.23s]  We're here, we're here.
[252.23s -> 253.23s]  Kill it.
[253.23s -> 254.23s]  Oh no, it might be too late.
[254.23s -> 255.23s]  Nope.
[255.23s -> 256.23s]  We got a big dude here.
[256.23s -> 258.04s]  Yes.
[258.04s -> 260.56s]  Alright.
[260.56s -> 261.74s]  Do you got...
[261.74s -> 262.74s]  No.
[262.74s -> 263.74s]  That was nuts.
[263.74s -> 265.30s]  I almost got crits.
[265.30s -> 266.30s]  This is the first...
[266.30s -> 267.30s]  Hey, this is the first...
[267.30s -> 268.30s]  No, not yet.
[268.30s -> 269.30s]  This is the first we've ever been.
[269.30s -> 270.30s]  Alright, do it now, do it now, do it now.
[270.30s -> 271.30s]  Go.
[271.30s -> 272.67s]  They popped uber.
[272.67s -> 274.23s]  Oh, come on.
[274.23s -> 276.23s]  Please tell me they're going to all have no open with this.
[276.23s -> 277.23s]  Come on.
[277.23s -> 278.66s]  Damn it.
[278.66s -> 280.92s]  No.
[280.92s -> 281.92s]  Fucking sniper.
[281.92s -> 282.92s]  Fuck.
[282.92s -> 283.92s]  It's alright, it's alright.
[283.92s -> 284.92s]  Get the medic, get the medic.
[284.92s -> 286.16s]  There we go.
[286.16s -> 287.16s]  Got him.
[287.16s -> 288.16s]  Get this, get him.
[288.16s -> 289.16s]  Get him.
[289.16s -> 290.16s]  Get him.
[290.16s -> 291.16s]  No.
[291.16s -> 292.16s]  It's alright, it's alright.
[292.16s -> 293.16s]  This is the furthest we've ever been.
[293.16s -> 294.86s]  Just relax, relax a little bit, relax.
[294.86s -> 295.86s]  We only have like a little bit left.
[295.86s -> 296.86s]  There's a sniper around.
[296.86s -> 297.86s]  Heads up.
[297.86s -> 298.86s]  There's a sniper around.
[298.86s -> 299.86s]  Be aware.
[299.86s -> 300.86s]  Watch out for this guy.
[300.86s -> 301.86s]  Got to kill his medics.
[301.86s -> 302.86s]  Oh, he's over here on the left.
[302.86s -> 303.86s]  On the right.
[303.86s -> 304.86s]  He's ubering.
[304.86s -> 305.86s]  Fuck.
[305.86s -> 307.42s]  It's alright, it's alright.
[307.42s -> 309.34s]  Knock the medic away, knock the medic away.
[309.36s -> 310.64s]  He's got to go down in a second.
[310.64s -> 311.64s]  He comes up here.
[311.64s -> 313.40s]  Yes.
[313.40s -> 314.40s]  Oh.
[314.40s -> 315.40s]  God.
[315.40s -> 316.40s]  I got to go.
[316.40s -> 317.40s]  I'm going to go buy crits.
[317.40s -> 318.40s]  I'm going to go buy crits.
[318.40s -> 319.40s]  Another one.
[319.40s -> 321.34s]  He's got medics though.
[321.34s -> 322.34s]  Alright, do not crits me.
[322.34s -> 324.41s]  Do not crits me.
[324.41s -> 325.41s]  Crits somebody else.
[325.41s -> 326.41s]  Do not crits me.
[326.41s -> 327.59s]  Oh, I've been knocked away.
[327.59s -> 328.59s]  Shit.
[328.59s -> 332.26s]  We did it.
[332.26s -> 335.29s]  We just did it.
[335.29s -> 336.29s]  Oh, we did it.
[336.29s -> 337.29s]  Yes.
[337.29s -> 338.29s]  Yes.
[338.29s -> 339.29s]  Yes.
[339.29s -> 340.29s]  Yes.
[340.29s -> 345.29s]  It only took us like three fucking hours.
[345.59s -> 351.95s]  Oh, anybody get anything good?
[351.95s -> 352.95s]  No.
[352.95s -> 354.32s]  No.
[354.32s -> 364.87s]  Oh, that was one of the most intense things I've ever done in gaming.
