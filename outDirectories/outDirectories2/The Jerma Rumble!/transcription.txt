[0.31s -> 13.08s]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the first ever German Rumble.
[13.08s -> 19.08s]  The rules are simple. If you are thrown over the top rope, you are eliminated from the game.
[19.08s -> 24.08s]  There are 20 competitors, each one will come out every 60 seconds.
[24.08s -> 28.08s]  And it's the German universe, so you could see anything.
[28.08s -> 34.08s]  Sit back, relax, and hold on to your seats, because here come the first two competitors.
[34.08s -> 38.96s]  And with that introduction, we are going to get right into this, get started here.
[38.96s -> 43.96s]  The first competitor, competitor number one, is going to be the Egg.
[43.96s -> 47.96s]  Now, a lot of you might not know who the Egg is, because he's been in one video.
[47.96s -> 53.96s]  And the video only has like 15,000 views, so not very many people know who he is, but he's number one.
[53.96s -> 58.96s]  And number two, the second of two starting in the ring, is going to be Gabe Newell.
[59.96s -> 65.96s]  So this should be quite interesting, Gabe Newell versus the Egg in the initial couple minutes here in the initial round.
[65.96s -> 73.02s]  And we're going to let this play out, guys, going to get this started. I hope you enjoy.
[73.02s -> 78.02s]  And there you have it, ladies and gentlemen, the bell is rung. The official first ever German Rumble is now underway.
[78.02s -> 81.02s]  Gabe Newell and the Egg are your first two competitors.
[81.02s -> 89.02s]  If you don't know how the Rumble works, essentially being the first two is very difficult to win the Rumble,
[89.02s -> 93.02s]  because you have to stay in here the entire time. And Gabe Newell looks like he could be getting pushed out.
[93.02s -> 95.02s]  No, takes a right hand to the Egg's face.
[95.02s -> 101.19s]  And hopefully both these competitors realize that if they want to have any, any dream of making it to the final five,
[101.19s -> 105.19s]  or even the final ten in this Rumble, they need to conserve their energy right now.
[105.19s -> 111.19s]  The Egg on the defensive getting his cranium pushed in by Gabe Newell, ducks under that punch, finds a way into the gut of the leader of Valve.
[111.19s -> 117.19s]  And we have our first introduction to do of the evening coming down the aisle right now.
[117.19s -> 126.19s]  There he is, the infamous blue spy from Team Fortress 2 in the number three spot, kind of making his way casually down the aisle.
[126.19s -> 131.19s]  He is on the offensive team, as you see, taking a break from his usual shenanigans in Team Fortress 2
[131.19s -> 135.19s]  to possibly come down here and help out Gabe Newell, who is in a little bit of trouble.
[135.19s -> 140.37s]  And you've got to be crazy to think that these two will not be working together. Of course they will be.
[140.37s -> 144.37s]  Gabe Newell going to take him up, setting him up for the double knee smash. That is a beautiful move.
[144.37s -> 150.37s]  Of course they'll be working together. Did anybody think differently? The Egg is in a ton of trouble, but wait a second!
[150.37s -> 156.37s]  The spy, I think, accidentally just hit Gabe Newell, maybe not going for a swinging neckbreaker on Gabe Newell. He turned!
[156.37s -> 161.85s]  You thought, I, this is unbelievable. Well, he is a backstabbing son of a bitch, so people, how would you not expect that?
[161.85s -> 166.85s]  But they still, Gabe Newell, that's your boss. He owns the company that you work for.
[166.85s -> 171.85s]  How could you do something like that and Gabe is not happy? Double teaming, working with the Egg now!
[171.85s -> 177.85s]  The times have turned, the tables have turned for the spy. This is outrageous and another competitor is on the way!
[177.85s -> 185.54s]  Pulling up the number four spot is coming down the ring aisle right now. There he is, and that's none other ladies and gentlemen than a
[185.54s -> 186.54s]  Yeah.
[186.54s -> 187.54s]  If you don't know who the
[187.54s -> 188.54s]  Yes.
[188.54s -> 193.54s]  There's plenty of them. There's thousands of them potentially. And it seems like one of them found their way into the arena.
[193.54s -> 198.54s]  Let's see how he fares against the people that are in the ring right now. We've got Gabe Newell and the Egg.
[198.54s -> 203.54s]  The spy seems to have let up a little bit on Gabe Newell. I think he's too afraid to go near those two,
[203.54s -> 209.54s]  considering that they were just double teaming. But there's no real answer to who is on whose side.
[209.54s -> 215.54s]  It's really every man for himself in the Royal Rumble. You can never expect any teammate to be a teammate for long.
[215.54s -> 220.54s]  They're going to turn eventually. It's just really a matter of time when. You could have your best friend, your worst enemy,
[220.54s -> 226.54s]  your girlfriend, your boyfriend, no matter who is in that ring with you, it no longer matters.
[226.54s -> 233.54s]  Everyone's trying to win and only one can. So we got five seconds or so left until another competitor comes down
[233.54s -> 236.54s]  and the ring is going to start to get a little bit crowded here.
[236.54s -> 240.54s]  More than five people in the ring at the same time is a little ridiculous.
[240.54s -> 245.72s]  And let's see who the next competitor is going to go down. It's another beer.
[245.72s -> 251.72s]  OK, I was actually not aware that there was more than one beer in this competition, but that's beer number 284.
[251.72s -> 256.90s]  Seems like he may have had a couple of drinks. He seems a little shitfaced right now, but that's OK.
[256.90s -> 261.90s]  We've got action in the ring right now. We've got the spy pushing the beer. We've got Gabe Newell tosses out the egg.
[261.90s -> 266.20s]  The first person to be eliminated is the egg in the German Rumble.
[266.20s -> 271.20s]  And don't sweat it, egg. Maybe you'll get to be in another video in like another three years.
[271.20s -> 275.20s]  Anyways, guys, we're going to move back to the action here. This is going to be very interesting.
[275.20s -> 280.20s]  You've got two beers who are from the same game. They're both from Grand Theft Auto IV.
[280.20s -> 283.38s]  And then you have Valve's Gabe Newell and the spy.
[283.38s -> 290.55s]  This is kind of turning into a tag team almost tournament rather than a Royal Rumble, which you don't get to really see that often.
[290.55s -> 295.55s]  And regardless, there's going to be a variable added to this equation in less than five seconds anyways.
[295.55s -> 301.55s]  So whatever was going to be here is pretty short lived. And Gabe Newell lining up a kick on the beer and kicks him right out.
[301.55s -> 306.55s]  The beer has been eliminated, one of the beers at least. And the spy has been eliminated too.
[306.55s -> 310.55s]  We didn't even get to see that. All the while another competitor coming down the aisle.
[310.55s -> 316.22s]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Batboy. And I'm fairly certain we can all agree on this.
[316.22s -> 324.40s]  That Batboy could be the shittiest character so far. And it would be a real shame if Batboy were to win this Royal Rumble.
[324.40s -> 329.40s]  I can just say that, but that's personally, you might be rooting for Batboy, but I don't think anybody is.
[329.40s -> 335.40s]  Let's be completely honest here. But Batboy doing a little bit of work, trying to throw what initially was Gabe Newell out of the ring.
[335.40s -> 338.40s]  But he has since turned his attention to this beer that's lying on the ground.
[338.40s -> 342.40s]  And Gabe Newell sitting there while Batboy just eliminated somebody.
[342.40s -> 348.40s]  Can we be clear on this? Batboy just got an elimination and he's like the worst character that was created.
[348.40s -> 352.40s]  Hopefully Gabe Newell throws him out right now. That's what's on everybody's mind. It looks like he's going to do it.
[352.40s -> 359.64s]  No! Batboy with the resilience of 20 bats fends off Gabe Newell and stays in the match.
[359.64s -> 365.64s]  And just like that, in what seems to be no time at all, we have somebody else coming down the ring.
[365.64s -> 370.25s]  I wonder who it could be. Could it be somebody that you all know and love?
[370.25s -> 379.66s]  Could it be Boo from YouTube? BooMan61 wearing the cape, which was crafted this afternoon, this very afternoon by his seamstress.
[379.66s -> 385.66s]  Boo has two live-in seamstresses for his various cape needs. But he's getting real fired up right now.
[385.66s -> 390.66s]  Going to run into the ring. Not going to waste any time. Going for a punch on Gabe Newell gets the block.
[390.66s -> 397.66s]  And an armbar and a kick right in his penis by the low-blowing bastard that is Batboy.
[397.66s -> 400.66s]  Those of you that want a little bit of a backstory on Batboy.
[400.66s -> 405.66s]  He was a bat and a boy and then was put into a test tube and then put under radiation.
[405.66s -> 411.22s]  And they were trying to make a Spider-Man type superhero, but it actually turned out to be Batboy.
[411.22s -> 417.22s]  It was just really, really annoying and he just pissed off all the people in the laboratory, so they made him leave.
[417.22s -> 421.22s]  They gave him a suitcase and they told him, hey, here's $4,000. Take the next train to Philadelphia.
[421.22s -> 425.22s]  And he showed up here somehow. I don't even know how he got into this competition, to be honest.
[425.22s -> 429.59s]  But who really cares about Batboy? We have more important things to discuss.
[429.59s -> 434.59s]  Like we are almost nearing the halfway point of the first ever Jerma Rumble.
[434.59s -> 438.59s]  And what a good opportunity to introduce this man, Captain Humphreys.
[438.59s -> 443.59s]  No one has ever seen his face, but he promised us some gold this afternoon and we're going to get it.
[443.59s -> 447.59s]  And there it is. Each one of those gold pieces is worth about 30 United States dollars.
[447.59s -> 449.59s]  So, audience, I'd start grabbing.
[449.59s -> 454.83s]  And it seems like Batboy is on his way out and Boo is staring off into space.
[454.83s -> 456.83s]  I think someone's giving him the middle finger in the audience.
[456.83s -> 459.83s]  Batboy has been eliminated! Batboy is gone!
[459.83s -> 463.83s]  Scratch him off your list if you're keeping track. That's the final time he'll be here.
[463.83s -> 466.83s]  I promise you won't see Batboy in any other video ever.
[466.83s -> 469.83s]  So, Batboy, get the fuck out of here.
[469.83s -> 474.83s]  Anyways, we got Captain Old Bones Humphreys versus Gabe Newell versus Boo Man 61.
[474.83s -> 478.83s]  And again, we have three contestants, three people in the ring.
[478.83s -> 483.83s]  You know, you like to see Royal Rumbles get really, really hectic with a bunch of people.
[483.83s -> 486.83s]  But right now, Captain Old Bones is fighting for his life.
[486.83s -> 490.83s]  He punches Gabe Newell. He punches Boo. It's not his time yet.
[490.83s -> 494.83s]  But it is time. It is time to introduce another person.
[494.83s -> 498.83s]  It happens every minute on the dot, so keep your eyes peeled for Sonic the Hedgehog.
[498.83s -> 502.01s]  Here he is, ladies and gentlemen. Made his way to the first time in the arena.
[502.01s -> 505.01s]  He's riling the crowd up. His latest game was a piece of shit.
[505.01s -> 510.01s]  But he doesn't care. He's here to redeem himself, to redeem the qualities of Sonic the Hedgehog in old style.
[510.01s -> 513.01s]  He's coming in old school to take on everybody.
[513.01s -> 516.25s]  And we will see how he fares against these fellow fighters.
[516.25s -> 518.25s]  But let's talk about Gabe Newell for a second.
[518.25s -> 521.25s]  If you've noticed, Gabe is still in this.
[521.25s -> 526.25s]  He was the first person. He was one of two. It was Gabe Newell and the Egg, if you remember.
[526.25s -> 529.25s]  And Gabe Newell is still in this. You never see this.
[529.25s -> 535.25s]  It's so rare to see somebody that was one of the first people stay in for this long.
[535.25s -> 537.25s]  And maybe we're going to see Captain Old Bones take his spill here.
[537.25s -> 540.25s]  Boo is really pushing him on that right tarbuckle.
[540.25s -> 542.25s]  He's going backwards. He's going to...
[542.25s -> 545.25s]  Oh, he goes over. No, he doesn't. He just barely doesn't go over the edge.
[545.25s -> 549.25s]  And we see a scope slam by Gabe Newell onto Sonic the Hedgehog.
[549.25s -> 554.25s]  And my goodness gracious, things are really heating up here with another competitor coming in in a second here.
[554.25s -> 560.25s]  Not sure who it could be, but we're going to see Gabe Newell here setting up a powerbomb over the top turnbuckle to Sonic the Hedgehog.
[560.25s -> 566.25s]  Sonic is eliminated as we move to our next person, our next opponent coming in.
[566.25s -> 570.42s]  It is none other than Cognitive Gaming's MLC Stealth.
[570.42s -> 572.42s]  Lighten up this arena with the fireworks.
[572.42s -> 576.42s]  He got those from Costco at about 4 a.m. last night, and he just barely set them up in time.
[576.42s -> 580.42s]  And does Costco sell fireworks? I don't even think they do, so forget about anything I just said.
[580.42s -> 586.42s]  Comes in and takes Gabe Newell out by the knee, and Sonic the Hedgehog is still sticking around right now.
[586.42s -> 594.42s]  He has choice words for Gabe Newell after that embarrassing powerbomb over the top turnbuckle and only being in for less than about 40 seconds.
[594.42s -> 599.42s]  Sonic was eliminated, so choice words, they're not exactly sure what was said, but I'm sure it was rotten.
[599.42s -> 602.37s]  By the way, will we have a second here?
[602.37s -> 606.17s]  What the hell was that? Did he just cartwheel for no reason?
[606.17s -> 610.66s]  I can't, I have no idea, but Old Bones nearly getting pushed out by Boo.
[610.66s -> 616.66s]  That's the second time that Boo has not been able to capitalize on Old Bones on the outside of the apron.
[616.66s -> 621.84s]  But we're at zero, which means another fighter is on their way down to ringside.
[621.84s -> 624.84s]  Fresh out of his time machine from the 1700s.
[624.84s -> 628.84s]  Please give a warm welcome to Benjamin Franklin.
[628.84s -> 630.84s]  It's a real honor to have him here.
[630.84s -> 635.84s]  It's a real pleasure to be hosting Ben Franklin on his first ever time travel trip.
[635.84s -> 639.84s]  He said when we interviewed him, I had to come to the Jerma Arena.
[639.84s -> 642.84s]  I was preparing for this day because I want to kick Jerma's ass.
[642.84s -> 646.08s]  That's a direct quote from Benjamin Franklin.
[646.08s -> 648.08s]  Look it up in one of your textbooks.
[648.08s -> 654.38s]  So there are five people in here now, coming on six if nobody is eliminated.
[654.38s -> 657.56s]  And people are just watching Ben Franklin punch Old Bones in the face.
[657.56s -> 658.56s]  Okay, that's fine.
[658.56s -> 660.56s]  And why are people letting him do this?
[660.56s -> 662.56s]  He just walked all over him without any contention.
[662.56s -> 664.56s]  What the hell was that?
[664.56s -> 665.56s]  I actually didn't see that.
[665.56s -> 667.56s]  That was, I did not know that happened.
[667.56s -> 669.56s]  I'm a little taken off guard by that.
[669.56s -> 671.56s]  But anyways, Ben Franklin pushing MLC stealth.
[671.56s -> 673.56s]  We got a couple of scuffles going on.
[673.56s -> 676.56s]  Nice belly to belly suplex by Boo.
[676.56s -> 679.80s]  And there's gonna be six people in here.
[679.80s -> 681.80s]  There's gonna be a sixth person coming in right now.
[681.80s -> 683.80s]  And it is Burger Boy.
[683.80s -> 686.30s]  Seems to have forgotten his pants.
[686.30s -> 690.54s]  He didn't forget his Ronald McDonald colored knee pads and armbands.
[690.54s -> 694.54s]  But he forgot to wear pants, which I wouldn't want to be near that guy.
[694.54s -> 696.54s]  I don't want to touch his balls or something.
[696.54s -> 697.54s]  That's really messed up.
[697.54s -> 698.54s]  But Boo, Boo has been eliminated.
[698.54s -> 699.54s]  Just like that.
[699.54s -> 700.54s]  Just that quickly.
[700.54s -> 702.54s]  Right when Burger Boy gets in the ring.
[702.54s -> 705.54s]  We almost had six people in here, but it turns out to be five.
[705.54s -> 710.54s]  And one of the top seeded players is no longer in this fight.
[710.54s -> 713.54s]  And we just saw a double choke slam by the likes of Burger Boy.
[713.54s -> 715.54s]  And throwing him against the ropes.
[715.54s -> 717.54s]  He's got a little bit of things to say to Ben Franklin.
[717.54s -> 720.54s]  Ben Franklin now throwing him alongside the ring.
[720.54s -> 723.54s]  Old Bones is kind of in the way there, but it's no match for Ben Franklin.
[723.54s -> 725.54s]  Ben Franklin with Ben Franklin with a lariat.
[725.54s -> 727.71s]  And Burger Boy is gone.
[727.71s -> 731.71s]  Burger Boy has been pushed out of this tournament in less than 20 seconds.
[731.71s -> 734.71s]  With a crushing lariat by Benjamin Franklin.
[734.71s -> 736.89s]  He has been training.
[736.89s -> 738.89s]  But is it going to be enough to withstand a kick from MLC Stealth?
[738.89s -> 739.89s]  It is not.
[739.89s -> 747.89s]  And Ben Franklin now is joining the members of people that have been thrown out of the ring in less than a minute's time.
[747.89s -> 748.89s]  That's unfortunate.
[748.89s -> 750.89s]  That is real unfortunate.
[750.89s -> 753.89s]  Ben Franklin traveled 400 years to get here.
[753.89s -> 756.89s]  And Gabe Newell almost gets thrown over too.
[756.89s -> 760.89s]  But time and time again holds on for dear life.
[760.89s -> 761.89s]  And he stays.
[761.89s -> 763.89s]  We're going to the second half of this rumble.
[763.89s -> 765.89s]  We're already in the second half.
[765.89s -> 767.89s]  And Gabe is still a contender.
[767.89s -> 770.64s]  Speaking of contenders.
[770.64s -> 774.64s]  We're going to see who lucky number 13 is or unlucky number 13.
[774.64s -> 776.64s]  Depending on how you look at superstitions.
[776.64s -> 778.64s]  There he is coming down here.
[778.64s -> 779.64s]  Nice and confident.
[779.64s -> 780.64s]  Nice and cocky.
[780.64s -> 781.64s]  It's Star.
[781.64s -> 782.64s]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[782.64s -> 784.64s]  Welcome Star to the arena.
[784.64s -> 786.64s]  He's coming in quite late.
[786.64s -> 791.64s]  So he does have a good chance to conserve energy and to be on top of his game.
[791.64s -> 793.64s]  We're going to see what happens.
[793.64s -> 795.64s]  He does not like old bones right off the bat.
[795.64s -> 797.64s]  Given a couple of punches to him.
[797.64s -> 799.64s]  Gives him a headbutt right to the back of his head.
[799.64s -> 801.64s]  Usually you see a headbutt to the front of the head.
[801.64s -> 803.64s]  But he was going for a different approach.
[803.64s -> 805.64s]  Going for the medulla oblongata it seems like.
[805.64s -> 807.64s]  And showing the strength.
[807.64s -> 811.64s]  Just power slamming the old bones down to the ground.
[811.64s -> 813.64s]  Rattling him to the core.
[813.64s -> 817.64s]  And really you like to see competitors stay a little bit chill at this point.
[817.64s -> 819.64s]  Especially if you're a character like Gabe.
[819.64s -> 821.64s]  Or if you're MLC stealth.
[821.64s -> 822.64s]  And you've been in here for a while.
[822.64s -> 823.64s]  Especially old bones.
[823.64s -> 825.64s]  We might see a double elimination here.
[825.64s -> 827.82s]  Two people rocking on the edge.
[827.82s -> 831.82s]  Star ends up getting out of his MLC stealth not so fortunate.
[831.82s -> 834.82s]  And he does a nice little backflip to keep himself in check.
[834.82s -> 835.82s]  And to keep himself there.
[835.82s -> 838.18s]  We have another entrance here.
[838.18s -> 839.18s]  Is that who I think it is?
[839.18s -> 842.62s]  That wouldn't happen to be MLG Grandpa would it?
[842.62s -> 843.98s]  It is!
[843.98s -> 844.98s]  It's Grandpa!
[844.98s -> 847.98s]  Coming down in his pajamas and socks.
[847.98s -> 852.22s]  Obviously does not care at all about the correct attire you would bring to a wrestling ring.
[852.22s -> 855.22s]  Him and Burger Boy have at least something in common.
[855.22s -> 857.22s]  Burger Boy was almost nude.
[857.22s -> 859.22s]  And Grandpa is in white socks.
[859.22s -> 861.22s]  He just got out of bed it seems.
[861.22s -> 864.22s]  Well that's not going to stop him from attacking MLC stealth.
[864.22s -> 866.22s]  And going for Gabe Newell.
[866.22s -> 868.22s]  You know I think Gabe Newell is really tired right now.
[868.22s -> 871.22s]  And Grandpa is taking that to his advantage.
[871.22s -> 874.22s]  Really trying to push him up on the turnbuckle here.
[874.22s -> 876.22s]  He's got Gabe in a really bad spot.
[876.22s -> 877.22s]  Looking down to the ground below.
[877.22s -> 878.22s]  He's trying to hold on.
[878.22s -> 879.22s]  Does not want to fall.
[879.22s -> 881.22s]  Star is not in time.
[881.22s -> 883.22s]  Gabe Newell is eliminated from the competition.
[883.22s -> 887.22s]  Star came over to what seemed like was trying to help out Gabe Newell.
[887.22s -> 888.22s]  And old bones!
[888.22s -> 890.22s]  Captain Humphreys is now gone as well.
[890.22s -> 892.22s]  That's two that are eliminated.
[892.22s -> 894.22s]  And another competitor is coming in.
[894.22s -> 896.53s]  God you just hate to see that.
[896.53s -> 898.53s]  Gabe was going to make it to the final forward scene.
[898.53s -> 900.53s]  But no he just was too tired.
[900.53s -> 903.53s]  And too much stress on his body.
[903.53s -> 905.53s]  And here comes Obama.
[905.53s -> 909.96s]  Rounding out number 15 is the current President of the United States.
[909.96s -> 911.96s]  He is riling the crowd up.
[911.96s -> 912.96s]  And he's pretty pumped himself.
[912.96s -> 914.96s]  He's starting to go into a little bit of a sprint here.
[914.96s -> 915.96s]  Where it seems like a jog.
[915.96s -> 917.96s]  Sliding right into the bottom of the ring.
[917.96s -> 920.96s]  And not going to do anything really crazy.
[920.96s -> 921.96s]  Kind of trying to grab for MLC.
[921.96s -> 922.96s]  Holy shit!
[922.96s -> 925.26s]  Star just did the big boot to MLC stealth.
[925.26s -> 927.26s]  And he is now gone.
[927.26s -> 929.44s]  That was a heinous boot.
[929.44s -> 931.68s]  And we got the President currently.
[931.68s -> 933.68s]  Obama taking a little bit of a knee there.
[933.68s -> 935.68s]  Going oh and Star gives him the bulldog.
[935.68s -> 938.11s]  Seems to be getting his bearings.
[938.11s -> 941.11s]  But Star and Grandpa both not relentlessly letting up.
[941.11s -> 943.11s]  And here comes a double DDT.
[943.11s -> 945.42s]  Obama is a top seed.
[945.42s -> 947.42s]  So it makes perfect sense.
[947.42s -> 948.42s]  Just like we saw with Boo.
[948.42s -> 949.42s]  And what a block by the President.
[949.42s -> 951.42s]  What a counter block by Grandpa.
[951.42s -> 953.59s]  Gets tossed right into the hands of Star.
[953.59s -> 954.59s]  Trying to throw him over the top rope.
[954.59s -> 956.59s]  But he is going to catch a breather here.
[956.59s -> 958.59s]  A much needed breather may I add.
[958.59s -> 961.59s]  And we're going to see another yet another person.
[961.59s -> 963.59s]  Coming down that wonderful aisle.
[963.59s -> 965.96s]  It's Danny DeVito.
[965.96s -> 968.39s]  Funny story about Danny DeVito.
[968.39s -> 970.39s]  This was actually supposed to be Italics.
[970.39s -> 973.39s]  But Burger Boy when we were creating characters.
[973.39s -> 976.76s]  Wrote over Italics with Danny DeVito.
[976.76s -> 980.76s]  And I didn't know this until I started recording my footage.
[980.76s -> 982.76s]  So Italics is now Danny DeVito.
[982.76s -> 983.76s]  That's the story.
[983.76s -> 986.26s]  So back to the action now.
[986.26s -> 989.26s]  Danny DeVito is in the ring for rusing around.
[989.26s -> 990.26s]  Looking for his first target.
[990.26s -> 992.26s]  It's going to be Star.
[992.26s -> 994.26s]  Belly to back suplex seems to be quite effective.
[994.26s -> 995.26s]  Blocked by the President.
[995.26s -> 997.26s]  And what a punch that was by Obama.
[997.26s -> 999.26s]  Knocked Grandpa clean on his ass.
[999.26s -> 1002.26s]  That was a hard, boisterous punch if I've ever seen one.
[1002.26s -> 1004.26s]  Trying to toss him out of the ring.
[1004.26s -> 1006.26s]  Grandpa going for it again.
[1006.26s -> 1007.26s]  Spinning around.
[1007.26s -> 1008.26s]  Throwing Obama around the side.
[1008.26s -> 1011.26s]  I'm just shocked to see him standing frankly.
[1011.26s -> 1012.26s]  After taking a blow like that.
[1012.26s -> 1013.26s]  And Obama is now gone.
[1013.26s -> 1016.26s]  Obama is now out of the competition.
[1016.26s -> 1018.26s]  He is riled up about that.
[1018.26s -> 1019.26s]  He is upset about that.
[1019.26s -> 1021.26s]  He had a good chance and he knew it.
[1021.26s -> 1022.26s]  To get to the final four.
[1022.26s -> 1023.26s]  At least in this competition.
[1023.26s -> 1025.26s]  But not right now.
[1025.26s -> 1027.26s]  He's going to get back to his presidential duties.
[1027.26s -> 1029.26s]  But now we got another person coming down and it...
[1029.26s -> 1031.01s]  Who the fuck is this?
[1031.01s -> 1035.02s]  What the hell is this thing?
[1035.02s -> 1036.02s]  Is this a giant chicken?
[1036.02s -> 1038.16s]  I guess so.
[1038.16s -> 1039.46s]  All right.
[1039.46s -> 1040.46s]  Well, ladies and gentlemen.
[1040.46s -> 1042.46s]  This is our new competitor.
[1042.46s -> 1044.46s]  Number 16 or 17 I believe.
[1044.46s -> 1045.46s]  I didn't check it out.
[1045.46s -> 1046.46s]  But it is the chicken.
[1046.46s -> 1048.41s]  Okay.
[1048.41s -> 1049.97s]  Here he comes.
[1049.97s -> 1053.27s]  Grandpa, Danny DeVito, the chicken and Star.
[1053.27s -> 1057.27s]  Are the remaining competitors with just a few more people.
[1057.27s -> 1059.27s]  That have not shown up yet.
[1059.27s -> 1061.27s]  And what a knee by Danny DeVito to the chicken.
[1061.27s -> 1062.27s]  Almost killing him.
[1062.27s -> 1065.27s]  I wish the chicken really did just like die right there.
[1065.27s -> 1066.27s]  Because the chicken like sucks.
[1066.27s -> 1068.83s]  But we'll treat him like a competitor regardless.
[1068.83s -> 1070.83s]  He has Star currently in a neck wrenching.
[1070.83s -> 1073.83s]  No, Star is going to pick him up and drop him on his back.
[1073.83s -> 1075.83s]  If you can even call that a back or his wings or...
[1075.83s -> 1077.83s]  And how tall is this guy?
[1077.83s -> 1081.25s]  The chickens like nine feet tall with that head.
[1081.25s -> 1084.25s]  And is that a person in a chicken suit or is that a chicken in a person suit?
[1084.25s -> 1085.25s]  I have absolutely no idea.
[1085.25s -> 1088.55s]  And I'm not going to ask that question again.
[1088.55s -> 1091.55s]  And it's scary to think that the chicken really could win this.
[1091.55s -> 1095.55s]  Because we're down to the last like six or seven people in the rumble.
[1095.55s -> 1099.55s]  One of these people has a very high probability that they're going to win.
[1099.55s -> 1103.24s]  And speaking of really dumb characters and stupid entrances.
[1103.24s -> 1105.48s]  Here comes glue man.
[1105.48s -> 1106.48s]  So let's check in with our Twitter poll.
[1106.48s -> 1109.48s]  That's been running since the very beginning of this Royal Rumble.
[1109.48s -> 1111.48s]  Who is the worst character that has been created?
[1111.48s -> 1116.48s]  And in the last 10 seconds, glue man has received 97,000 votes.
[1116.48s -> 1120.17s]  Anywho, let's talk about the rumble in general.
[1120.17s -> 1124.17s]  There are only two people left that have not come down into the ring.
[1124.17s -> 1129.17s]  Everybody in here and those remaining two are the only competitors left.
[1129.17s -> 1131.34s]  So who are those remaining two people?
[1131.34s -> 1133.58s]  I can maybe guess one of them.
[1133.58s -> 1136.14s]  But the other one, I just really don't know.
[1136.14s -> 1138.14s]  And I can promise you one thing.
[1138.14s -> 1142.14s]  There are no more chickens and no more bat boys and glue men.
[1142.14s -> 1145.14s]  So keep that in mind while you're thinking of the final two people.
[1145.14s -> 1148.96s]  Currently there is a situation over on the left side.
[1148.96s -> 1151.96s]  Star is about to be eliminated by Danny DeVito and he is.
[1151.96s -> 1155.96s]  Star is not going to win this time, not this competition.
[1155.96s -> 1159.96s]  And we have our second to last competitor coming down the aisle right now.
[1159.96s -> 1160.96s]  Who do you think it is?
[1160.96s -> 1162.96s]  He looks really great right now.
[1162.96s -> 1164.96s]  Looks like he's been in the gym too.
[1164.96s -> 1166.96s]  It's Jerma, Jerma985.
[1166.96s -> 1168.96s]  He looks fantastic.
[1168.96s -> 1170.96s]  What a real great guy he looks like.
[1170.96s -> 1173.96s]  Anyways, he's coming in right now to try and rough up these people.
[1173.96s -> 1177.96s]  It's coming to me right now just how ridiculous I made this character.
[1177.96s -> 1181.96s]  Anyways, Grandpa taking a couple of swings on him, snaps the neck down.
[1181.96s -> 1184.96s]  And the chicken, the chicken could be eliminated right now.
[1184.96s -> 1189.96s]  We could see the end of the chicken and we are going to see Danny DeVito Italics eliminates the chicken.
[1189.96s -> 1193.96s]  That's another stupid character that has no chance of winning this rumble.
[1193.96s -> 1195.96s]  He's not. Did you see that face?
[1195.96s -> 1197.96s]  That was a really, really messed up face.
[1197.96s -> 1199.96s]  But Jerma getting thrown over the ropes.
[1199.96s -> 1202.96s]  It's these four and one other.
[1202.96s -> 1204.96s]  Danny DeVito could be going out now.
[1204.96s -> 1208.96s]  Three people, three people have been eliminated in the last one minute.
[1208.96s -> 1210.96s]  It's down to three now.
[1210.96s -> 1213.96s]  And this one final person.
[1213.96s -> 1214.96s]  Who could this person be?
[1214.96s -> 1217.96s]  And is Grandpa going to get eliminated right now?
[1217.96s -> 1218.96s]  Yes, he is.
[1218.96s -> 1220.20s]  The last three people.
[1220.20s -> 1225.58s]  Three people, Jerma, Glueman and another Bière.
[1225.58s -> 1230.58s]  A spectacular entrance for the final entry to this competition.
[1230.58s -> 1232.58s]  And what a competition it has been.
[1232.58s -> 1235.58s]  What a roller coaster ride this has been.
[1235.58s -> 1237.58s]  We are down to the final three.
[1237.58s -> 1244.29s]  Bière 419, Glueman and Jerma 985.
[1244.29s -> 1246.29s]  That sums it up perfectly for me, folks.
[1246.29s -> 1248.46s]  That sums it up for me.
[1248.46s -> 1251.46s]  And just before we get out of here, before this video ends in the next few minutes,
[1251.46s -> 1253.46s]  I just want to thank everybody for watching.
[1253.46s -> 1257.46s]  Thank you for sticking around to watch the first ever Jerma Rumble.
[1257.46s -> 1258.46s]  It's been a lot of fun.
[1258.46s -> 1260.46s]  It's been a lot of great times.
[1260.46s -> 1263.46s]  And here we go with the final three.
[1263.46s -> 1264.46s]  Hope you enjoy.
[1264.46s -> 1267.46s]  Ladies and gentlemen, let's get started.
[1267.46s -> 1268.46s]  The Bière going in for a headlock.
[1268.46s -> 1271.46s]  Jerma breaks it up, throwing him into the turnbuckle.
[1271.46s -> 1273.70s]  Glueman kind of just looking on.
[1273.70s -> 1274.70s]  And Jerma is dipping over.
[1274.70s -> 1275.70s]  Jerma dips him over the side.
[1275.70s -> 1277.70s]  We are down to two competitors.
[1277.70s -> 1279.70s]  It's Glueman or Jerma.
[1279.70s -> 1280.70s]  That was quick.
[1280.70s -> 1281.70s]  That was fast.
[1281.70s -> 1283.70s]  That is how we like to see it.
[1283.70s -> 1286.94s]  And you can feel the intensity between these two.
[1286.94s -> 1289.94s]  One of them is going to be crowned champion of the first Jerma Rumble.
[1289.94s -> 1294.94s]  Could it be Glueman, the shittiest character voted on Twitter, or will it be Jerma?
[1294.94s -> 1295.94s]  No one is sure.
[1295.94s -> 1296.94s]  All we know is it's intense.
[1296.94s -> 1299.94s]  And speaking of intensity, here comes a push.
[1299.94s -> 1301.94s]  Here comes, could be the final push of the night.
[1301.94s -> 1303.94s]  Glueman is holding for dear life.
[1303.94s -> 1304.94s]  Jerma is trying to dip him.
[1304.94s -> 1305.94s]  Jerma gets him over the side.
[1305.94s -> 1306.94s]  Is he going to get it?
[1306.94s -> 1307.94s]  Jerma dips him over the side.
[1307.94s -> 1310.94s]  Jerma is your winner of the first ever Jerma Rumble.
[1310.94s -> 1318.36s]  And you can see just how good it is to come into a rumble in the final four or the final five.
[1318.36s -> 1323.36s]  If you get in in the final five, you have such a huge advantage over everybody else.
[1323.36s -> 1326.36s]  And Jerma or me proved that here today.
[1326.36s -> 1328.36s]  So thank you everybody so much for watching.
[1328.36s -> 1329.36s]  I really do appreciate it.
[1329.36s -> 1332.36s]  If you want to see more Jerma Rumbles, please let me know.
[1332.36s -> 1335.36s]  I'm not against doing another one of these.
[1335.36s -> 1336.36s]  And this is a lot of fun to make.
[1336.36s -> 1337.36s]  So I'll see you guys all next time.
[1337.36s -> 1340.36s]  Thank you so much for watching the Jerma Rumble.
