[0.38s -> 15.82s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[15.82s -> 25.06s]  And tonight, gonna be playing as the Heavy with the Tomislav the Sandvich and the Killing Gloves of Boxing.
[25.06s -> 34.24s]  And guys, I've done something I haven't done in a very long time. I've stayed up for over 24 hours for a gaming session.
[34.24s -> 38.67s]  I'm a little bit delirious right now. I haven't done this since I was in college.
[38.67s -> 43.91s]  And it's kind of hard to talk into the mic to be very, very honest with you. It's hard for me to form words.
[43.91s -> 46.91s]  I feel like I've been hit in the head by a sausage or something.
[46.91s -> 51.09s]  But I want to make this video because I want to talk about this very important topic.
[51.09s -> 54.58s]  And it is being excited for a game again.
[54.58s -> 64.58s]  Now, in the comments section before I get into this video, I want you to leave me a comment about the last game that you were this excited for where you were to stay up for over 24 hours.
[64.58s -> 67.58s]  This game for me, that game for me is Diablo III.
[67.58s -> 75.82s]  So Diablo III came out and me, Shibby, Star, MLC Stealth, Burger Boy, and Boo's been in the calls with us.
[75.82s -> 79.82s]  But we have all been playing this game pretty much nonstop since its release.
[79.82s -> 83.82s]  And maybe this is the endorphins talking right now because I haven't slept or anything.
[83.82s -> 85.82s]  But yeah, I feel like a million bucks.
[85.82s -> 89.19s]  Something about those long gaming sessions where you get with a group of friends.
[89.19s -> 93.19s]  You all are having a great time, all on a call, all or even if you're at somebody's house.
[93.19s -> 99.37s]  Back in the day when I was in college, I would be in a dormitory with seven or six or seven other guys.
[99.37s -> 102.37s]  And we'd all be playing a game and we could all yell at each other.
[102.37s -> 105.37s]  We could all, you know, trash talk, have fun because that's what it's all about.
[105.37s -> 111.99s]  So these videos that I've been recording off and on, I figured out a potential series to do with Diablo III.
[111.99s -> 114.99s]  But I'm not going to really tell you yet because it's kind of in the works.
[114.99s -> 116.99s]  But it's going to be very, very interesting if it goes through.
[118.17s -> 122.17s]  You might see a video tomorrow or the next day about some of our travels in Diablo III.
[122.17s -> 125.17s]  Me, Shibby, Star, and Brett, MLC Stealth.
[125.17s -> 130.03s]  So keep on the eye out. Keep your eye out for that.
[130.03s -> 135.03s]  And I have got a couple of PMs of people wondering if I'm going to do certain things with the server and stuff like that.
[135.03s -> 139.21s]  But Team Fortress 2 has kind of been on the back burner at least the last 48 hours
[139.21s -> 144.90s]  because I've just been having a grand old time in Diablo III.
[144.90s -> 149.90s]  And just touching back again on long sessions and being really psyched for a game that finally comes out.
[149.90s -> 151.90s]  You've been waiting for so long when it finally launches.
[151.90s -> 154.90s]  The midnight release of a game is a really awesome event.
[154.90s -> 158.20s]  If you have never been to one of those before, please go.
[158.20s -> 160.20s]  Try and get yourself to one of them.
[160.20s -> 165.20s]  If you're not old enough, if you're kind of young, you might have to wait a few years to be allowed to go to those
[165.20s -> 168.20s]  or to get some more freedom so you can stay up a little later.
[168.20s -> 171.20s]  But they are so cool because you just walk into the front door,
[171.20s -> 175.20s]  whether it's, you know, you go to your GameStop or Walmart or wherever is having this midnight release.
[175.20s -> 179.38s]  And it's just everybody collectively there for the same reason.
[179.38s -> 182.62s]  It's the same thing. It's almost like going to a mini gaming convention.
[182.62s -> 185.62s]  It's very, very odd. You walk in the front door and there's people that are just like,
[185.62s -> 187.62s]  Oh my God, everyone's talking about the game.
[187.62s -> 189.62s]  Everyone's talking about what the story is going to happen.
[189.62s -> 191.62s]  Who's going to do this? What's going to do that?
[191.62s -> 193.62s]  And it really is interesting. It's really a lot of fun.
[193.62s -> 197.79s]  And it gets you right into the zone, makes you go right into game mode.
[197.79s -> 201.79s]  And I've been in that mode for, like I said, exactly 48 hours.
[201.79s -> 204.61s]  And I want to touch upon the gameplay.
[204.61s -> 206.61s]  Did you see what was just going on right there? I thought that was hysterical.
[206.61s -> 211.61s]  I was just unloading my minigun on that sentry and it wouldn't go down.
[211.61s -> 214.61s]  And I was hoping that at some point that engineer was going to run out of metal.
[214.61s -> 217.61s]  And somebody came up behind me. We were like crossing the streams,
[217.61s -> 219.61s]  Ghostbuster style, trying to take out that sentry.
[219.61s -> 223.61s]  And finally he picked it up, which was a move that was going to end in his demise.
[223.61s -> 225.61s]  And it actually did. But I thought that was hysterical.
[225.61s -> 229.61s]  I'm just holding the mouse button down, going like, how much metal does this dude have?
[229.61s -> 234.81s]  But the next game that I plan on doing something like this for,
[234.81s -> 236.98s]  I don't even know if it's going to happen.
[236.98s -> 239.98s]  You can never plan these out. You can never plan out these long gaming sessions
[239.98s -> 242.98s]  that end in tireless nights where you stay up all night.
[242.98s -> 246.48s]  But probably, probably Grand Theft Auto V.
[246.48s -> 252.48s]  That might be the next 24 to 48 hour game session where I inhale coffee for three days.
[252.48s -> 255.48s]  But that's probably the only one I can think of that would be next.
[255.48s -> 259.10s]  Other than that, nothing I can really think of off the top of my head.
[259.10s -> 262.10s]  But there will always be another one.
[262.10s -> 264.10s]  There's always going to be that new game coming out.
[264.10s -> 267.28s]  There's always going to be that new amazing title that you're waiting for.
[267.28s -> 270.28s]  But to be totally honest, Diablo III and the Diablo franchise
[270.28s -> 274.28s]  has a very, very big stake in my heart because it's my childhood.
[274.28s -> 280.58s]  When I heard that Diablo III was going to have a sequel, I almost estabricated.
[280.58s -> 282.58s]  You know, it was ridiculous. I freaked out.
[282.58s -> 285.58s]  And it's because Diablo I and II I played when I was a young teenager.
[285.58s -> 288.58s]  And it's like seeing your childhood come back to life.
[288.58s -> 290.58s]  And it's amazing with these things.
[290.58s -> 293.76s]  And I say the same thing about the Neverhood with the Doug to Naples game.
[293.76s -> 295.94s]  I just wish they would be something else.
[295.94s -> 297.94s]  And you always reach for something. You always reach for more.
[297.94s -> 302.18s]  And you hope, God, maybe one day they'll bring that series back to life.
[302.18s -> 305.54s]  And I'm sure a lot of you guys share the same passion that I do
[305.54s -> 308.54s]  for gaming and video game culture in general.
[308.54s -> 312.54s]  So it can be a real amazing day when you finally sit down with that game.
[312.54s -> 314.54s]  And Diablo is that game for me.
[314.54s -> 317.30s]  This video is very, very ranty.
[317.30s -> 318.30s]  And I do apologize for that.
[318.30s -> 322.30s]  But like I said, my brain is like scrambled eggs right now.
[322.30s -> 325.98s]  But before this video ends, just the final thought here is,
[325.98s -> 327.98s]  like I said in the very beginning,
[327.98s -> 331.22s]  shoot me some comments and give me some of your experiences
[331.22s -> 334.22s]  with your longtime franchises you want to see revived
[334.22s -> 336.22s]  or some of your crazy gaming sessions.
[336.22s -> 339.22s]  Because we are in this all together as a community.
[339.22s -> 341.22s]  And Otto is about to...
[341.22s -> 343.22s]  Get away from those wires.
[343.22s -> 345.22s]  He's like biting the wires from my computer.
[345.22s -> 348.55s]  I'm going to break this computer. Get out of here.
[348.55s -> 351.55s]  So that is going to wrap up this particular video, guys.
[351.55s -> 353.55s]  Thank you all so much for watching.
[353.55s -> 354.73s]  I really do appreciate it.
[354.73s -> 356.73s]  And I'll catch you guys all next time.
[356.73s -> 359.29s]  I've got to get some sleep.
[359.29s -> 362.59s]  So take care, everybody.
