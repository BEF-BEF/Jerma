[1.08s -> 7.78s]  Hello ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, it's me Anthony Wimbleton here with another German 9.85 shoutcast on his Shadow of a Team Fortress 2.
[7.78s -> 11.88s]  I got a lot of requests to get back into this and do another shoutcast, so I'm gonna start it here we go.
[11.88s -> 13.38s]  One, two, three, four, five, let's do it!
[13.38s -> 18.88s]  Playing right now is the Soldier with the black box and the shock and the default shock and actually it is strange, I'm sorry about that.
[18.88s -> 22.08s]  And I have on the frying pan, I think I do.
[22.08s -> 26.98s]  Playing with the black box right now, when you use the black box, when you shoot somebody and you make direct contact with them,
[26.98s -> 29.28s]  you get plus 15 health added to your total health.
[29.28s -> 31.68s]  It is amazing, unbelievable Soldier item.
[31.68s -> 37.38s]  Playing on King of the Hill Harvest Final right now, one of the more fun maps in Team Fortress 2, especially for King of the Hill maps.
[37.38s -> 42.98s]  Getting this started now, Jerma comes out here, shoots a rocket to the right side and look at the point capture, it is almost capped for the red team.
[42.98s -> 47.68s]  Spy almost gets the backstab on Jerma, but he's not smart enough to get behind him, so Jerma's okay.
[47.68s -> 51.38s]  Sniper right here, Jerma gets a couple of rockets on him, gets the final shot on him and kills him.
[51.38s -> 53.18s]  Jerma is fine, ran and dandy.
[53.18s -> 57.58s]  Unfortunately, the medic went down and Jerma is very saddened by that, but Jerma is now trying to defend the point.
[57.58s -> 62.08s]  We got a couple of people coming on here, Scout gets on the point, Jerma gets a malpiro coming on here now, Jerma is okay.
[62.08s -> 65.98s]  He may be on fire, but Jerma has the confidence of 15 balls running in the ball parade.
[65.98s -> 68.78s]  If you've never seen the ball parade, it's a very, very interesting thing, funny to watch.
[68.78s -> 71.98s]  If you want to check it out, go to www.BallParadeIsAwesomeAndFun.com.
[71.98s -> 74.88s]  That website does not exist, I just made it up, please do not go there and waste your time.
[74.88s -> 77.78s]  Jerma gets the health back and is now on fire again.
[77.78s -> 81.18s]  When I say that, I mean that metaphorically, now he's on fire with the shots.
[81.18s -> 84.88s]  Prime example right here, Jerma turns around, sees an enemy pyro, shooting a friendly pyro.
[84.88s -> 88.38s]  Which one's the right pyro? Just like a mystery movie on TV, he makes the right decision.
[88.38s -> 93.08s]  Enemy Spy gets blown up as well, and now he got a soldier on soldier fight right here with Jerma versus this dude.
[93.08s -> 94.78s]  We don't know his name, I'm not sure, I'll find out.
[94.78s -> 96.78s]  He gets a couple of shots and exchanging fire.
[96.78s -> 99.88s]  What's gonna happen here? He's getting no more shots, that pulls out the shot, can equalize and run away.
[99.88s -> 104.48s]  Does he get the- he gets the shot right in his back, unbelievable display of athleticism.
[104.48s -> 107.78s]  I gotta bring in one of my colleagues right now to try and explain what just happened.
[107.78s -> 110.38s]  Everyone, please welcome David from the mail room.
[110.38s -> 113.88s]  David, how can you analyze that situation? What just happened?
[113.88s -> 115.68s]  That was pretty cool.
[115.68s -> 120.18s]  Yeah, I'm sure it was pretty cool, David, but the real reason why I invited you up here was because I'm actually firing you.
[120.18s -> 123.58s]  So you're fired, thanks for coming, your performance has been pretty lackluster, et cetera, et cetera.
[123.58s -> 124.88s]  See you later, thanks for coming.
[124.88s -> 126.78s]  Take a look now at the bottom portion of your screen.
[126.78s -> 129.48s]  You will see that the enemy just capped the point, which is bad news,
[129.48s -> 134.08s]  cause Jerma and his medic could have been out here protecting it, but they were in that choke point the whole time.
[134.08s -> 139.18s]  Getting a couple of shotgun shots on that soldier, and he gets a blind fire shot on exactly what I'm not sure,
[139.18s -> 141.28s]  but he kills whatever the hell was in there.
[141.28s -> 143.18s]  Medic now has a hundred percent uber charge.
[143.18s -> 148.08s]  Jerma, this pyro, and his medic trying to find a way back onto the point to take it back to square one for the blue team.
[148.08s -> 152.18s]  Scout gets on the point. He is not a factor because he's on fire and runs away, frankly.
[152.18s -> 156.28s]  They got the point captured right here, and this is where things get really, really rocky for the blue team.
[156.28s -> 158.88s]  Here comes the entire red team. Here comes Puff, the uber.
[158.88s -> 162.28s]  Kaboom! There they all go, everyone's dead, absolutely fantastic.
[162.28s -> 165.18s]  Trying to find somebody to shoot at, they're covered in the uber charge goo.
[165.18s -> 167.18s]  Looking to the left, Jerma sees a sniper and a scout,
[167.18s -> 171.28s]  but he doesn't want to go deal with him because, as we all know, he wants to find the heavy medic pair again,
[171.28s -> 173.38s]  straight ahead towards the spawn area.
[173.38s -> 177.68s]  And sure as sheep's milk, he finds him, shoots the heavy, and shoots the medic with a couple of shotgun shots.
[177.68s -> 179.68s]  That was exactly what he was looking for.
[179.68s -> 182.98s]  Jerma and his medic now come out to the courtyard area, get lit on fire by a pyro.
[182.98s -> 185.18s]  He's going for the extinguisher kill. He does not get it.
[185.18s -> 186.68s]  Jerma gets him with a shotgun kill.
[186.68s -> 189.48s]  Treading backwards now, Jerma does not want to get shot in the face by anybody.
[189.48s -> 190.98s]  Lots of people around here on the red team.
[190.98s -> 193.88s]  Jerma finds a way backwards, and here comes another enemy pyro.
[193.88s -> 196.48s]  Jerma gets the lucky shot on him. Unbelievable.
[196.48s -> 200.08s]  Whipping around this corner, Jerma sees a disguised spy, gets him with a lucky crit.
[200.08s -> 204.08s]  Not sure if he's a dead ringer or not, but it doesn't matter because he checks this demo man behind him anyways.
[204.08s -> 205.38s]  It's not a dead ringer.
[205.38s -> 208.48s]  Runging now down towards this heavy, Jerma's being a really risky bastard.
[208.48s -> 212.58s]  Is he going to get the shot? One, two, three, oh no!
[212.58s -> 218.42s]  Jerma dies, and that is going to be the end of the shoutcast because I'm...
[218.42s -> 221.64s]  out of breath.
[221.64s -> 226.34s]  So if you're wondering why I decided to do this, I wanted to put a one-life gameplay
[226.34s -> 230.94s]  and a shoutcast together because I got a lot of good responses from both of those two things.
[230.94s -> 236.88s]  People like the shoutcast, people like the one-life series, so I figure why not combine them?
[236.88s -> 241.18s]  And technically what you're seeing now is not any more of the one-life gameplay,
[241.18s -> 246.08s]  but like you all know, I do not like to have gameplays that last less than three, four, five minutes.
[246.08s -> 248.58s]  So I'm going to talk to you about one more thing here.
[248.58s -> 253.68s]  So if you are familiar with my Facebook, then you already know this and I don't have to tell you again,
[253.78s -> 257.38s]  but for those of you that do not know, I am now a Machinima Respawn Director.
[257.38s -> 261.38s]  I mentioned it in my Q&A answers video, maybe for a second or two,
[261.38s -> 266.28s]  but Grandpa is going to have a show on Machinima Respawn now.
[266.28s -> 269.68s]  I will let you guys know whenever that happens, whenever it's going to be up there.
[269.68s -> 273.18s]  I can't wait to get started. I can't wait to get my first upload on there.
[273.18s -> 276.96s]  I am going crazy right now. I'm going to work so hard on this, guys.
[276.96s -> 278.56s]  Thank you, everybody.
[278.56s -> 282.16s]  This is to every single one of you out there that subscribed, that liked, that favored,
[282.16s -> 285.66s]  that do everything, that do anything you guys do to support this channel.
[285.66s -> 288.36s]  I'm totally grateful and I always will be grateful.
[288.36s -> 293.56s]  And for the first person that subscribed to this channel, the first guy, you rock, dude.
[293.56s -> 296.96s]  And the guy that just subscribed two seconds ago, all you guys rock.
[296.96s -> 301.26s]  You guys are all amazing and hopefully that this series will take off
[301.26s -> 304.26s]  and maybe get some more support, maybe get some more channel growth.
[304.26s -> 307.46s]  Who knows what's going to happen, but thank you all so much for watching.
[307.46s -> 311.86s]  I really do appreciate it. I will see you all next time and take care, everybody.
