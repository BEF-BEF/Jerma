[0.31s -> 13.54s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with Theme Hospital.
[13.54s -> 18.24s]  Now, this is kind of going to be in the Enlightened series, I guess you could say.
[18.24s -> 21.54s]  Even though it's been a million years since you've last seen Enlightened.
[21.54s -> 25.47s]  But can you even read this text? I don't think, whatever, you can't read it.
[25.47s -> 30.97s]  I know how to play. This used to be one of my favorite games on the PlayStation 1, if you could believe it.
[30.97s -> 34.77s]  And you run your own hospital. It's one of the first, I can't really say first,
[34.77s -> 40.77s]  but it's one of the original hospital sims. It might even be the only hospital sim.
[40.77s -> 44.81s]  I have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about. But we're going to get right into this here.
[44.81s -> 49.11s]  I'm just going to play until I don't care anymore. Maybe like 10, 15 minutes.
[49.11s -> 52.81s]  If you want to see more of Theme Hospital, then let me know.
[52.81s -> 57.71s]  But I should probably get going because the hospital opens in like 35 seconds.
[57.71s -> 61.54s]  So let's go. I know I need a GP's office.
[61.54s -> 67.52s]  And it works just like the sims, where you kind of build rooms, you build individual walls.
[67.52s -> 72.64s]  I don't want the GP's office that huge. That looks good.
[72.64s -> 77.92s]  That's not a valid blueprint? Well, screw you. Now it is. Check.
[77.92s -> 81.85s]  Got to put the door on. Couple of windows. Alright.
[81.85s -> 84.55s]  So this is where people come into the hospital. The whole point of this...
[84.55s -> 88.97s]  Oh, damn it. Hold on. I didn't mean to do that. Pick that up.
[88.97s -> 94.54s]  Pick up the... Whatever. My doctor doesn't even need to face his patients. I really don't care.
[94.64s -> 98.27s]  This guy's going to give me tips and tricks as we go, but whatever.
[98.27s -> 103.97s]  So when people walk in the door with an illness, let's say that I have a cough, my like chest hurts.
[103.97s -> 110.43s]  Then they go to the receptionist who is not currently here yet, but I'm going to make her.
[110.43s -> 118.24s]  Where is facilities? Clinics? Treatment? Diagnostics? Where the hell is the reception?
[118.24s -> 123.26s]  Oh, there it is. Reception desk. And that's the build button.
[123.26s -> 127.76s]  So people come right... Should we make it like right here so they don't have to wait in line at all?
[127.76s -> 132.98s]  Yeah, we will. Got to hire a receptionist.
[132.98s -> 135.08s]  Alright, who can we hire?
[135.08s -> 139.74s]  K Kingsmith. She seems like a bitch. I don't think we want her.
[139.74s -> 145.17s]  F Petcliff. Enjoys river widening. Poorly trained and...
[145.17s -> 149.95s]  I thought that said reckless. Feckless.
[149.95s -> 157.54s]  What? Is that an F? Am I crazy? Why is that an F? Poorly trained and feckless.
[157.54s -> 160.47s]  Alright, well anyways, she's reckless. I don't want her.
[160.47s -> 164.97s]  Drinks wine dedicated to helping people with a smile. You know, she might be drunk,
[164.97s -> 170.01s]  but she's going to take the job seriously. Except she's like walking the wrong way.
[170.01s -> 175.20s]  Honey. Honey, you're the recep... Oh no, that's a nurse! Shit!
[175.20s -> 179.72s]  It's okay, we'll need her later. Here's the receptionist. Here we go.
[179.72s -> 181.72s]  Very friendly. Very friendly. There.
[181.72s -> 184.52s]  I accidentally made a stupid nurse that's not going to do anything until we need her later.
[184.52s -> 187.62s]  Okay, well whatever. I need a doctor. This hospital is going to open soon.
[187.62s -> 190.47s]  Got to get a doctor to in the doctor's office.
[190.47s -> 196.62s]  Alright, we could do this guy. An expert at DIY. Rude and abrasive.
[196.62s -> 202.18s]  Gets people's backs up. Gets people's backs up? What? What?
[202.18s -> 206.67s]  It's kind of an explanation. Tickles trout. No, stop it.
[206.67s -> 211.48s]  Enjoys French art house films? Alright, well this guy's alright. He likes like films.
[211.48s -> 214.92s]  Go work there, you son of a bitch.
[214.92s -> 219.42s]  Alright, we got our doctor that sees the patients. We got our nurse wandering aimlessly.
[219.42s -> 221.42s]  And we have our reception right at the front door.
[221.42s -> 227.42s]  So, we need general diagnostics. We'll put that right next to...
[228.42s -> 233.62s]  You are so loud, lady. I wish you didn't just scream in my ear.
[233.62s -> 238.87s]  We're going to put a couple benches over here. Don't worry, this is where people get diagnosed.
[238.87s -> 245.50s]  The changing screen will go right next to the window. I want people to get like seen naked.
[245.50s -> 251.39s]  This like weird machine can go over here. And there we go.
[251.39s -> 257.14s]  I believe we need a doctor to actually be in here to like take care of people.
[257.14s -> 259.64s]  And this guy's going to have to like do two things at once. Do we have any patients yet?
[259.64s -> 261.64s]  No, the door to the hospital's not even open.
[261.64s -> 267.82s]  Wandering the nurse is okay for the time being. I need a janitor, I know that.
[267.82s -> 273.25s]  Alright, grandpa collects World War II shrapnel and go back.
[273.25s -> 275.12s]  Well, you already got fired.
[275.12s -> 278.92s]  Smuggles fake watchers. Superb stamina. You know, he just keeps going.
[278.92s -> 281.92s]  You know, it's grandpa. Alright, well just go over there. Screw you.
[281.92s -> 285.88s]  Hospital's open. The hospital is officially open.
[285.88s -> 291.81s]  We're going to get some people with some weird diseases to walk up this weird like Tetris hallway.
[293.82s -> 297.49s]  Look at this guy. He's freaking out.
[297.49s -> 300.67s]  Hey, dude, somebody gave like grandpa too much coffee.
[300.67s -> 304.67s]  I gotta go. I gotta go. Where's the trash?
[304.67s -> 308.40s]  What a psycho. Somebody needs to slow him down.
[308.40s -> 313.08s]  Do we have any patients yet? Uh oh. Ladies and gentlemen, we got a live one.
[313.08s -> 316.70s]  Okay, he's going to go over here. Actually, I want benches. I want benches.
[316.70s -> 324.84s]  A bench to go right here. Come in. I'm taking a dump.
[324.84s -> 329.84s]  See, this guy diagnoses the problem. He sends them over to the other doctor that does not exist yet, but he will very shortly.
[329.84s -> 335.29s]  Doctor? I'm working on it. I'm working on it.
[335.29s -> 337.29s]  Whatever. You can do it. It doesn't matter.
[337.29s -> 341.04s]  Hey, I just got this job five seconds ago.
[341.04s -> 343.04s]  You've satisfied the financial criteria for this level.
[343.04s -> 347.04s]  Now keep your balance above a thousand while making sure your hospital is running efficiently.
[347.04s -> 349.48s]  Where are people going?
[349.48s -> 355.94s]  Alright, just diagnose this guy. Grandpa's still on crack. That's fine.
[355.94s -> 365.56s]  We got diagnosis. We could go for a psychiatric ward, I think, in case any people come in that need to get their mental health in check.
[365.56s -> 370.92s]  I know I need a pharmacy, and that gives a place for the nurse to go who's wandering around the pharmacy.
[370.92s -> 377.13s]  Yeah, he's going. Don't worry. Pharmacy will be over here. A little bit bigger.
[377.13s -> 382.10s]  Gonna put you to work, nurse, because you're kind of just doing nothing.
[382.10s -> 385.53s]  You're just wasting like $100 an hour for me.
[385.53s -> 393.24s]  Alright, get in there. You. Get. Get in there. I just put her in.
[393.24s -> 397.68s]  British lady, that's yelling at me. I understand.
[397.68s -> 399.68s]  Okay, we got another one. Where'd that patient go? Where'd that first patient go?
[399.68s -> 402.62s]  Oh, he's gonna go get like a drink.
[402.62s -> 404.62s]  Alright, let's see if we can cure our first patient.
[404.62s -> 412.90s]  How do you feel? You paid me $400. Sick.
[412.90s -> 415.90s]  Thank you for coming to the hospital, sir. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay.
[415.90s -> 417.90s]  Hopefully you don't go home and insta-puke.
[417.90s -> 420.90s]  Well, thanks for the high rating, too. I appreciate that. Thank you.
[420.90s -> 424.29s]  Oh, shit. Where is he?
[424.29s -> 426.72s]  Yeah, get over there, you chump.
[426.72s -> 430.09s]  Yeah, he's knocking on the door. He's standing in front of him.
[430.09s -> 434.80s]  Okay, I gotta make another... Facilities.
[434.80s -> 437.17s]  Need some... I need some bathrooms.
[437.17s -> 441.00s]  Bathrooms can go up here. Yeah.
[441.00s -> 444.44s]  That's a pretty huge bathroom.
[444.44s -> 449.06s]  Yeah, there's one... Oh, man. This bathroom's way too big.
[449.06s -> 452.06s]  And you know, just because I'm a cynical dick,
[452.06s -> 456.06s]  I'm gonna put the staff room next to the toilets,
[456.06s -> 459.36s]  because I'm just a jerk. I'm a bad boss.
[459.36s -> 461.36s]  And you should feel bad working for me.
[461.36s -> 467.76s]  Grandpa, get out of the way. I can't build this if you're standing on it.
[467.76s -> 469.71s]  He hasn't done any work.
[469.71s -> 471.71s]  He's just been running a marathon around this whole damn place.
[471.71s -> 476.24s]  There's the sofa. That's okay.
[476.24s -> 478.24s]  Got the staff room now in case somebody wants to chill out.
[478.24s -> 483.51s]  No, there's no trash. Where's this guy going?
[483.51s -> 485.51s]  He's going to get a potion, I think, to the pharmacy.
[485.51s -> 489.58s]  Yeah, pay me my money. I'm the goddamn hospital owner.
[489.58s -> 491.58s]  I'll inject you with this syringe I got.
[491.58s -> 499.48s]  We gonna cure our second patient? Oh, yeah.
[499.48s -> 504.12s]  How we doing? How we doing? We got a consistency...
[504.12s -> 507.20s]  What is this guy? Oh, my God.
[507.20s -> 511.27s]  Who let, like, Uncle Fester in here?
[512.27s -> 516.13s]  He's a baby. It's a baby.
[517.82s -> 520.82s]  This guy has a baby face. That's his disease.
[520.82s -> 525.38s]  Uh, yeah, doctor, you know, I'm not sure if you can realize this or not,
[525.38s -> 527.38s]  but I have a friggin' baby face.
[527.38s -> 533.20s]  How do you cure this? This guy needs to go into, like, surgery.
[533.20s -> 537.57s]  Apparently, the baby face disease is an epidemic in this city.
[537.57s -> 541.39s]  Look at this guy, except he's, like, blonde.
[541.39s -> 543.39s]  Oh, wait. No, I remember. I gotta make an inflation station.
[543.39s -> 548.02s]  That rhymed. Uh, clinics. Inflation. There it is.
[548.02s -> 552.05s]  This'll go down here. There's no space over here.
[552.05s -> 555.93s]  But, yeah, you can get this game right now on good old games.
[555.93s -> 562.36s]  It's a doozy. It's a doozy.
[562.36s -> 565.36s]  I believe... I don't want to say an incorrect amount of money. I forget.
[565.36s -> 567.36s]  It's, like, less than ten bucks. It's, like...
[567.36s -> 570.36s]  I think it's, like, six or seven dollars for this game on GOG.com.
[570.36s -> 573.60s]  Theme Hospital is the name again. You probably saw the title.
[573.60s -> 576.60s]  So, I mean, whatever. Do we need another nurse? I think we do.
[576.60s -> 580.82s]  Or does the doctor have to do this? I'm not sure.
[580.82s -> 582.82s]  I'm sure the lady will yell at me once I find out what...
[582.82s -> 587.21s]  No, we got the invisible man. He's, like, the invisible disease.
[587.21s -> 589.45s]  All right, now I need another doctor. Gotta hire another doctor.
[589.45s -> 591.45s]  How are my resources doing? Pretty good.
[591.45s -> 595.23s]  All right, I'm gonna find a good doctor.
[595.23s -> 598.85s]  Ex-Quiz Show host, rash and easily distracted.
[598.85s -> 602.35s]  Sings in a rock and roll band? Absolutely.
[602.35s -> 604.35s]  You are the new hiree.
[604.35s -> 607.35s]  Now, let's, like, take some of that air out of your face.
[607.35s -> 616.24s]  Oh! Oh, my...
[616.24s -> 619.24s]  Keep in mind, guys, that guy just paid me $850
[619.24s -> 622.24s]  to stick a needle in his face and blow his head up.
[622.24s -> 624.24s]  That probably was very painful.
[624.24s -> 628.20s]  Okay, okay, okay.
[628.20s -> 633.05s]  This guy...
[652.35s -> 655.48s]  That 72% is pretty high.
[655.48s -> 659.20s]  I'm gonna go ahead and say go for it. Go for it.
[659.20s -> 664.11s]  This is the guy, right? Let's see if it works.
[664.11s -> 667.12s]  I got one of the best nurses in the city working for me.
[667.12s -> 669.12s]  Dude, you'll be fine.
[669.12s -> 673.90s]  There you go. Good as new. Good as new.
[673.90s -> 677.60s]  And...hey, it worked.
[677.60s -> 683.04s]  For the money. VIP.
[683.04s -> 685.64s]  The mayor of Crater...
[685.64s -> 690.88s]  What? He's dead. You just killed your first patient.
[690.88s -> 692.88s]  No, it said there was a 72% chance I was...
[692.88s -> 694.88s]  Wait, he's alive.
[694.88s -> 699.47s]  Oh, no, never mind. See you later, death.
[699.47s -> 701.77s]  That was a 72% chance that it was gonna work.
[701.77s -> 704.01s]  I don't want to do that again.
[704.01s -> 707.79s]  This is an even less chance. What the...what?
[707.79s -> 711.12s]  All right, hold on. Let me get another diagnostic room.
[711.12s -> 714.32s]  Let's see if we can make this right.
[714.32s -> 717.31s]  Ward, pharmacy,
[717.31s -> 719.31s]  inflation, diagnostic, psychiatric...
[719.31s -> 722.68s]  Maybe it's all in their head.
[722.68s -> 724.86s]  We're gonna get a ward up here.
[724.86s -> 728.51s]  Because maybe we gotta send these guys to the ward?
[728.51s -> 730.51s]  That was ridiculous. I can't believe that guy died.
[730.51s -> 733.32s]  No, I can't go there. I can't go there.
[733.32s -> 735.82s]  Where am I gonna put this goddamn...
[735.82s -> 739.15s]  I did pretty poor planning.
[739.15s -> 742.14s]  I'm just gonna have to go over here.
[742.14s -> 744.14s]  Damn it. No, that's a terrible spot.
[744.14s -> 746.76s]  What about right here? It'll be next to the reception desk.
[746.76s -> 750.92s]  Holy hell, that's a terrible spot for this.
[750.92s -> 753.29s]  Hey, welcome to the hospital.
[753.29s -> 758.73s]  Place more benches? People are...
[758.73s -> 761.10s]  being forced to stand up.
[761.10s -> 764.17s]  What is Maya McCheese doing?
[764.17s -> 767.12s]  Is he like gonna...
[767.12s -> 769.92s]  Oh, shut up. Shut up.
[769.92s -> 772.99s]  We're good. Send the invisible guy over here.
[772.99s -> 776.06s]  Let's go...no, no, no. I don't want to do that.
[776.06s -> 779.96s]  I need another nurse, right?
[779.96s -> 782.70s]  I do. Oh, there she is.
[782.70s -> 786.59s]  But that means the nurse from over here just left.
[786.59s -> 788.59s]  Where's the nurse now? I'll pay for it.
[788.59s -> 792.24s]  I got the money. Why not?
[792.24s -> 795.31s]  Oh, benches, that's what she said?
[795.31s -> 797.61s]  Need a drink machine, too. Dr. Pepper.
[797.61s -> 799.61s]  Gotta have like a Dr. Pepper machine, like right next to the doctor's office.
[799.61s -> 802.24s]  Look at how popular this thing are.
[802.24s -> 804.48s]  $20?!
[804.48s -> 806.84s]  Did you just see how much money that was?
[806.84s -> 808.84s]  That was $20
[808.84s -> 812.16s]  for a Coke. $20.
[812.16s -> 814.16s]  I don't know what kind of weird, screwed-up
[814.16s -> 816.16s]  dimension these people are living in
[816.16s -> 818.16s]  where soda is $20.
[818.16s -> 821.36s]  I'm a bad man for running this kind of
[821.36s -> 827.10s]  organization. Get out of here.
[827.10s -> 829.34s]  Okay. Hall of Shame?
[829.34s -> 833.82s]  Did I just lose the game?
[833.82s -> 839.76s]  Did I lose the game?
[839.76s -> 846.08s]  What?
[846.08s -> 848.08s]  Dear Jerma, marvelous, you have handled the
[848.08s -> 850.08s]  running of this hospital superbly.
[850.08s -> 852.08s]  Us bigwigs at the Ministry
[852.08s -> 854.08s]  of Health would like to know if you'd be interested
[854.08s -> 856.08s]  in taking on a larger project.
[856.08s -> 858.08s]  This is a job we think would be perfect for you.
[858.08s -> 860.08s]  The salary would be $16,000.
[860.08s -> 862.08s]  I would absolutely
[862.08s -> 864.08s]  take that. Thank you so much.
[864.08s -> 866.32s]  I did it. I beat the level.
[866.32s -> 868.68s]  What do you know about that?
[868.68s -> 870.68s]  Anyways, guys, that's probably going to wrap up this episode.
[870.68s -> 872.68s]  If you want to see more Theme Hospital,
[872.68s -> 874.68s]  I mean, I'm not sure how much of a series
[874.68s -> 876.68s]  I'm going to do with this because it's pretty self-explanatory,
[876.68s -> 878.68s]  but it's a very, very fun game, Live
[878.68s -> 880.68s]  Enlighten, today, if you enjoyed it.
[880.68s -> 882.68s]  Then let me know, and I'll see you guys all next time.
[882.68s -> 884.68s]  Take care, everybody. See you all
[884.68s -> 886.68s]  soon. Inject the needle in his face.
