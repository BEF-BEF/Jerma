[0.31s -> 14.44s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[14.44s -> 23.44s]  And tonight, gonna be playing as the Soldier with the Default Rocket Launcher, the Conqueror, the recently buffed Conqueror, and the Escape Plan.
[23.44s -> 32.44s]  And this is also gonna be a coffee commentary of Justice and Doom. Just wanna let you know beforehand, in one, a two, a three, that's how many licks it takes to get to the bottom of a Pyro Pop.
[32.44s -> 35.44s]  So let's keep going here with this coffee commentary.
[35.44s -> 45.68s]  Okay, so a coffee commentary is when I just hit record, and I just go after drinking a couple coffees, and I'm just crazy and out of my mind.
[45.68s -> 51.68s]  Let's go! So playing on Coldfront again with the Soldier, and this is a very underplayed map.
[51.68s -> 61.68s]  I wish I could play on this a lot more often, but every time I do the server browser, it seems like there's only four, or maybe even two, that are in the entire server browser, which is unfortunate.
[61.68s -> 66.68s]  But I know it's a five control point map, and they take ages on public games, because they just go back and forth.
[66.68s -> 70.68s]  It's always just a stalemate. It's always just a stale, smelly fishmate.
[70.68s -> 76.10s]  So that's what I gotta say about Coldfront. No, I'm lying. I actually have more to say about Coldfront.
[76.10s -> 83.10s]  Any time I hear the word Coldfront or the map or whatever, I always just think of some weatherman just standing in front of the green screen just going,
[83.10s -> 92.10s]  Yep, today there's gonna be a Coldfront coming down from the northwest section coming down to the northeast, and it's just absolutely gonna wreck your house, and you're all gonna die.
[92.10s -> 98.10s]  I've never heard a weatherman say that, but he could. It might be one day a weatherman's gonna come on the screen and just go,
[98.10s -> 107.34s]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's a giant tornado coming straight for your house. Please run! And we're all gonna run, and hopefully we all survive.
[107.34s -> 112.34s]  Also, why does this guy have a blue face? I've been realizing this right now. Why did I draw him with a blue face?
[112.34s -> 121.34s]  What is he, Grover from Sesame Street? Like, what is this guy? It's like Grover and Bozo the Clown had a child, and there he is on the screen for you.
[121.34s -> 126.51s]  I promise, I'm so bad at drawing, I will never draw anything ever again.
[126.51s -> 131.26s]  So, soldier, Coldfront killed a couple people, a soldier and a scout.
[131.26s -> 138.26s]  This is a great place to hang out as a soldier, because so many people just stuff down this left side, or right side if you're on the blue team.
[138.26s -> 145.26s]  It's just crazy, so many people just filter into that little area, and plus you have this little gate right here to protect yourself if somebody comes after you.
[145.26s -> 148.26s]  Like there, I just got a two-piece because of this gate.
[148.26s -> 154.26s]  And oh, my HUD, I keep seeing the numbers pop up. I keep forgetting to do this, and I really am sorry.
[154.26s -> 158.26s]  I am gonna put my HUD in the description of every Team Fortress video now.
[158.26s -> 165.26s]  It's actually stars. He took KN, the KN Garmin HUD combination, and he made it his own. He did the little things, too, and he tweaked it.
[165.26s -> 169.26s]  But it's gonna be in the description of my videos. You can get it from his channel page, too.
[169.26s -> 173.50s]  But that's the HUD. That's the big hubbub of the HUD.
[173.50s -> 176.50s]  So here's my favorite part of the whole video. I got nowhere to go, so I just...
[176.50s -> 186.38s]  I get shot right in the back by a sniper. If I had stood up and tried to go around that gate, that sentry would have lit up my entire Christmas tree, and I would have died instantly.
[186.38s -> 191.38s]  But we're gonna transition here. This is a second gameplay, a one-life gameplay. Both of these are one-life, back-to-back.
[191.38s -> 197.38s]  This is defending the final point on Coldfront, and I think... I don't remember if we push forward or not.
[197.38s -> 203.38s]  I think we do, but my brain is swish-cheese, so sometimes I forget things, and this is something I absolutely forgot.
[203.38s -> 208.38s]  So we're either gonna push up or we're not gonna push up, which is pretty much the outcome of any video you watch on Team Fortress.
[208.38s -> 212.38s]  Hey, you're either gonna lose or you're gonna win. Which one is it gonna be?
[212.38s -> 217.69s]  So let's take on this soldier right now. Me and you. Here we go, buddy. One, two, rocket. Scott, you landed. Let's do it.
[217.69s -> 226.69s]  And miss. And just shoot 150 rockets at him and miss every time. And the Pyro got him, though, so that's a good thing. Good job, Pyro. You are my friend.
[226.69s -> 230.93s]  Blowing the horn. Let's see what I can do with this now. I'm just gonna shellcast. I have no idea what's gonna happen.
[230.93s -> 235.23s]  So, turning this corner, seeing a couple friendlies running away from the front line. Something to miss must be happening.
[235.23s -> 242.23s]  Crit rocket, shooting this guy. That's actually a spy, and here's a spy tip for you. If you're gonna play as a medic, I'm sorry. If you're gonna disguise as a medic, you want to make sure you want to do one very important thing.
[242.23s -> 249.23s]  Don't run around with a syringe gun. Change to the Bonesaw or the Medigun, because if you run around with a syringe gun, everyone's gonna think you're a spy, and everyone's gonna know you're a spy because you're actually running around not healing anybody.
[249.23s -> 255.60s]  So please use that as a tip and killing that medic in the meantime, in the process.
[255.60s -> 268.60s]  But I'll slow it down for you. If you're gonna play as a spy, make sure when you're disguising as a medic, pull out the Medigun, switch to your secondary and hit B, because then at least you're running around with the Medigun, and you look like you're doing something medic-y.
[268.60s -> 274.16s]  Not shooting people with a syringe gun or something. It looks a little less suspicious.
[274.16s -> 281.16s]  Coming down to one minute left in this coffee commentary. Watching this heavy explode makes me sad, but that's kind of funny at the same time.
[281.16s -> 284.16s]  Anytime anyone explodes in this game, it's actually pretty funny.
[284.16s -> 294.16s]  But in the last 40 seconds I have, I want to say one thing. The Conqueror is really, really good now. They made it so much better, it takes like no time at all to charge this thing.
[294.16s -> 302.16s]  The health it gives back is not really that spectacular, but the amount of times you can do it in such a short duration, it makes it worth it.
[302.16s -> 307.59s]  That's gonna wrap things up here, guys. Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[307.59s -> 314.59s]  And if you like this video, go ahead and throw me a like, because it really does help spread the infection of the germs. Help spread the infection.
[314.59s -> 320.90s]  But yeah, guys, of course, I will see you guys all next time, and take care, everybody.
