[4.54s -> 17.56s]  Hey, what's up? How you doing? Welcome to a fun little afternoon. Today we are going to be playing
[17.56s -> 25.83s]  Warhammer 40,000 Dark Tide. It is a sponsored stream, so thank you Warhammer for the sponsor.
[26.71s -> 38.34s]  Drops are on if you want to participate. Drops are on for the game. This is currently the beta.
[40.20s -> 46.62s]  You pre-order the game right now. You'll get access to the beta before the game comes out on the 30th.
[47.34s -> 58.60s]  We got some friends in here. We've got Vinny, we've got Kraiken, and we've got Charborg.
[60.89s -> 68.36s]  I think it's gonna be a pretty fun time. But again, thank you Warhammer for the sponsor. Let's get
[68.36s -> 79.13s]  started pulling up the YouTube voice. You know, let's see how they're doing. And then like us
[79.13s -> 82.81s]  calling the meeting exactly at the moment you were about to die and you run into the room.
[83.13s -> 89.37s]  Yeah. How the fuck did that even happen? I have no idea, dude. That was such a fun session. I
[89.37s -> 93.69s]  really like want to play more. What, the, the, the Among Us section? Yeah. Yeah, we were just
[93.69s -> 97.77s]  talking about it. It was so good. It was really fun. But like, I don't know, I, dude, I put,
[98.65s -> 108.18s]  I put all my VR away. I, I just like, no, I just like put it away. Salvation Army. It just, it
[108.18s -> 112.42s]  takes up so much space. It's just such a huge thing. It just like, it turns your whole room
[112.42s -> 122.26s]  into a different room. Right. That's the rule. Yeah. All right. Well, me and Kraik and we'll
[122.26s -> 126.90s]  just do Among Us again, I guess. That's fine. You guys can watch it on their streams. It'd be fun.
[127.70s -> 134.50s]  Snot has requested to join. It's not one of you guys. This might know. I don't think that's any of
[134.50s -> 145.46s]  us. Did I get an invite? I did invite ice cream. I think you could also right click and join too.
[145.46s -> 147.70s]  Oh, can I just, is it from like the mission terminal?
[151.40s -> 156.84s]  Escape menu. Oh, in this team, your friend, your friend, please. Oh, there it is. Okay.
[157.80s -> 164.20s]  Snot Fondler has joined the match. Well, we're gonna have to, uh, we're gonna have to,
[165.08s -> 175.13s]  I don't, it says I don't have any invites. You have social invites, friends, even, oh, there you are.
[175.13s -> 181.45s]  Okay. So let me just join. Invite to now join your team. Right. Are you Snot? No, not Snot,
[181.45s -> 187.38s]  right? No, I am not Snot. It's not keeps trying to join. Maybe it's, maybe it's Charbord. Is it
[187.38s -> 195.14s]  Charbord? Charbord would unmute, right? I mean, and I see you. Yeah. No, no, no. I haven't joined.
[195.14s -> 199.46s]  Oh, there we go. Okay. Wait, somebody just randomly invite me or is that you? That was me. All
[199.46s -> 208.42s]  right. Okay. Who's Spush? That's, that's you, Charb? Yes, that's me. I'm Spush. Okay. All right.
[208.42s -> 216.02s]  There we go. How'd you get to level four? I'm level, am I level four? Yeah. Oh, no, that's
[216.02s -> 220.98s]  actually a visual bug. I think it's level one. Oh, it says you're all level 25 for me. What the
[220.98s -> 224.66s]  fuck? You want to see my character? We're all level four. Oh, I see. It's a visual bug. Yeah,
[224.66s -> 233.96s]  you're right. Yeah. So, um, we, is there anything we can do for a few minutes? Cause I don't know.
[233.96s -> 240.20s]  We might have to wait. We might have to wait. We can wait like 10 minutes if you want. Okay. Um,
[241.26s -> 246.62s]  so how much do you know about this game? Yeah. Maybe give it, give it, give it a quick. I mean,
[246.62s -> 254.38s]  I used to, believe it or not, I was a huge, huge, uh, Warhammer 40k RTS fan. Really? Oh, massive.
[255.18s -> 261.26s]  Um, I played as the Tao. Uh, I thought they were, I liked the, uh, what's the hero for the Tao?
[261.82s -> 269.50s]  It's, uh, XV. What's his name? I actually don't know. The guy with the flamethrower.
[270.92s -> 276.44s]  My chat's about to explode with the answer though. And then I also played, uh, what was the, the
[276.44s -> 282.84s]  chaos? Not the chaos. There was a different, like the K88. Yes. That's it. XV88. What was the other
[282.92s -> 290.25s]  one? There was another one in that expansion, the chaos elves or something. Oh, the, uh, Eldar.
[290.25s -> 298.76s]  Yeah. It was like the new expansion one. Yeah. The dark Eldar. Dark Eldar. Yep. Yep. That was
[298.76s -> 305.08s]  the other one. That's cool guys. Did you, did you play? Are you a huge, uh, Warhammer nerd?
[306.04s -> 310.84s]  Yeah. Oh yeah. What's your, what's your favorite army? It's definitely, I mean, knowing you, it's
[311.08s -> 321.64s]  um, the Blimpticus. Oh yeah. Blimpticus. Yeah. The boy, the Blimpticus. Oh, you made that up. Okay.
[321.64s -> 327.11s]  I was like, what the hell is the Blimpticus? He's flipping through his little handbook. Hold on.
[328.95s -> 336.62s]  I don't see that in, in, in my CTA. The Blimpticus. But yeah. So you get four classes,
[336.62s -> 341.91s]  right? I guess we can, let's go over it for real. Um, there's four classes and yeah, this is the,
[341.91s -> 347.72s]  what's, what's the, um, the, the Ogre or the, the Ogren, right? There's also, so this is like a
[347.72s -> 353.40s]  melee short range focus character, right? Yeah. He's like kind of the tank. You get shields later
[353.40s -> 359.24s]  on. You get like explosive weapons and a big old, like you have a dagger. That's the size of like
[359.24s -> 363.80s]  our entire body that you just swing around. So it's cool. You just kind of wait into the battle and
[363.80s -> 370.26s]  hold the line for everyone. Oh, I probably have some cosmetics, don't I? Let's see. Oh, I just
[370.26s -> 373.78s]  have a green t-shirt. Yeah. I don't have any cosmetics. I'm in my pajamas at level one.
[376.34s -> 380.34s]  So wait a minute. The thing dropped at, uh, in 15 minutes, right?
[380.34s -> 384.04s]  The thing? Uh, in exactly like probably, I think 15 minutes.
[384.04s -> 389.93s]  No, do we have to start exactly at that time? Yes. Okay. Then we, we need, we need to start a
[389.93s -> 396.09s]  mission. We need to be available at exactly 14 minutes. We're, we're all good. Mental. We're at
[396.09s -> 400.89s]  the, at the mission board. Uh, Trevor, what's your character's name? Um, my character's name or, uh,
[400.89s -> 406.89s]  my steam game? Uh, well, I, I believe I have you on steam unless you changed it. Turn your
[406.89s -> 411.37s]  eyes up. My character's name is snot. And before you make fun of it. We, it was him. We, we were
[411.37s -> 416.41s]  like, we were trying to kick you over and over again. Oh really? We don't know snot. No. We were
[416.41s -> 421.69s]  like, who's this snot guy? Oh, on the lower of my planet, that means it, I know it probably means
[421.69s -> 426.63s]  something else for you guys, but for me, it means something entirely different. Oh, please do tell.
[426.71s -> 434.55s]  Uh, it means runny boogers. Oh, no. Thanks for the info. That makes a lot of sense. Everybody
[434.55s -> 439.69s]  have a good sound quality now. I think I had to turn some of you guys up. I, I always, every,
[439.69s -> 443.21s]  every time I play a game on discord, I always have to go through and just individually do all the
[443.21s -> 448.84s]  bars. Yeah. Everyone. Oh, maybe I should do the advanced training just so people can see what it
[448.84s -> 456.02s]  looks like. Yeah. My training would take you like five minutes. It's, it's good to learn a lot.
[456.02s -> 460.58s]  I want to meet up with you guys. I want to see you. I'm at the big little, uh, I'm so excited.
[461.22s -> 466.42s]  The mission terminal. I'm at the meat grinder, just practicing, uh, my weaponing. Yeah. Where
[466.42s -> 474.02s]  is the, uh, the training area? Left. It's like a big old, there's like a lady in a tube in like a
[474.02s -> 482.09s]  circular room. It's called the psych, psychinium. There's a lady in a tube. Okay. Yeah. No, that's a
[482.09s -> 489.99s]  barber. Wait. Okay. The guns are a little loud. Yeah. That's what guns do chat.
[489.99s -> 496.39s]  Is your hair. Don't tell Brian, don't tell German where the meat grinder is.
[496.39s -> 500.39s]  Well, that's where the training is. Your personality trim.
[501.75s -> 511.80s]  Should I use, should I get the bugle berry? Whatever. Is there a map? No. Um, I haven't found
[511.80s -> 518.55s]  one. You just kind of learn. Oh wait, I found the barber. Yeah. You can get it. It's pretty damn
[518.55s -> 524.04s]  good in this. I have to say I was playing last night and I was like, Oh, like, Ooh, that music.
[524.68s -> 528.68s]  Yeah. Kind of surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Yeah. I, uh, so I've been playing this game
[528.68s -> 535.00s]  a lot over the last week or so that it's been available. And like two nights ago, I was in bed
[535.00s -> 539.16s]  just listening to Spotify and chilling out, like getting ready to sleep. And so the, the
[539.16s -> 544.36s]  soundtrack for this game is on Spotify and it auto really started playing the soundtrack from this
[544.36s -> 548.76s]  game. After I'd just gotten done playing this game and my eyes literally went wide up like,
[548.76s -> 553.32s]  like a Wokage emote. I was like, and I like got up out of bed and went back to my computer and
[553.32s -> 558.52s]  played for two hours because I was like, so moved by the, it felt like it made, it was like,
[558.52s -> 563.00s]  I got to play this now. Yeah. It was, it just, you know, the emperor called me and I had to,
[563.00s -> 567.72s]  yeah, to respond to the call. Yeah. At that point you had to, I'm very excited. I've, I've
[567.72s -> 572.04s]  in the prologue and there was some, there was some music that was just,
[572.04s -> 576.47s]  it seemed like I was swinging to the beat and it seemed like it was cool. Right.
[576.47s -> 581.82s]  So I'm very excited and I'm very excited as to potentially happening here. And
[582.30s -> 587.26s]  were you a big left for dead guy at all? I was, I, I actually, I loved it left for dead, but
[587.26s -> 591.34s]  you'll love this. Yeah. I mean, I, I played Vermintide. Vermintide was a lot of fun.
[591.34s -> 594.86s]  Yeah. See, I had never played Vermintide. So this was my first experience of this
[595.42s -> 601.02s]  series aside from Dawn of War. That's the only other 40 K I've ever played. Yeah. So,
[601.02s -> 604.14s]  so when I played this last night, I was like, oh, this is, this is good.
[605.74s -> 611.14s]  Dawn of War was, I was obsessed with it. Yeah. That was awesome.
[611.14s -> 618.23s]  Yeah. So Vermintide in this game, both have like really, I think, well-tuned both gun and
[618.23s -> 623.45s]  like melee combat. So just the pacing of like fighting through hordes and pushing things back
[623.45s -> 628.41s]  and then dodging out of the way of like stuff. It's all very readable. Is there any, anything,
[628.41s -> 632.57s]  where's the least amount of info in the screen? Top right, top left, bottom right was like the,
[632.57s -> 637.38s]  where's there like no info? Are you looking for a cam spot? Yeah. I need a cam spot here. You
[637.38s -> 642.65s]  should do a direct middle. Yeah. They always want the middle for me too. I think top right has been
[642.73s -> 647.37s]  the least amount that I've seen. Okay. Yeah. Or top left is just like the watermark. The beta
[647.37s -> 657.22s]  test. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm, I'm ready. So you played the tabletop, Jerma, back in your... No,
[657.22s -> 662.14s]  I played on like the RTS, the Warhammer 40 K. Oh, the RTS one. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I,
[662.14s -> 666.62s]  I started playing through Vermintide. That's my first exposure to the Warhammer universe. And then
[666.62s -> 670.86s]  I played the Total War Warhammer franchise, which I fell in love with. I love the voice work. So this
[670.86s -> 676.63s]  is like my first big 40 K one. The voice acting is always like 10 out of 10 in these games.
[676.63s -> 681.72s]  I love it too. Oh, are we doing voices? Please. Can we do voices? I love role play. Just guys,
[681.72s -> 689.77s]  lads. Okay. I'll be my guy that I picked. What does that sound like? My character sounds exactly
[689.77s -> 700.50s]  like me. It's really weird. It is kind of weird. Yeah. I thought like this kind of like salt spire
[700.50s -> 705.22s]  from Vermintide. I was going to say, yep. Yep. That's it. That's the classic. The Pernicus,
[705.78s -> 714.06s]  the Zealot. Vinny, why are you on the news again? Because I saw that game. I saw that. I
[714.06s -> 718.84s]  saw you on the news again, Vinny. What are you doing? What happened? You want to explain?
[718.84s -> 726.42s]  Yeah, I'll explain. Uh, the reporter interviewed me for Trombone Champ. And then I explained it
[726.42s -> 732.39s]  while I was playing Placid Plastic Duck Simulator. It's just a plastic duck game. And I said, I dare
[732.39s -> 737.75s]  an interview viewer to interview me about this. I was like, come on news. We can, we can do something
[737.75s -> 744.17s]  like this, um, about this game where you just watch ducks fall into a pool. And then the interviewer
[744.17s -> 750.07s]  from the previous segment emailed me and said, challenge accepted. And then he interviewed me
[750.07s -> 756.09s]  with my alien on the couch next to me about this plastic duck game. And that's literally all I was
[756.09s -> 762.01s]  on the news for. You know what's kind of nonsense? Yeah. You as it goes, as it's going right now,
[762.01s -> 766.41s]  you are potentially going to potentially be interviewed on the news more than like
[767.13s -> 772.25s]  Ninja. You know what I mean? If it keeps going this way. Yeah. Just keeps, just keep telling people
[772.25s -> 777.83s]  to do it and they'll keep doing it. All right. I challenge, I challenge anyone to interview me
[777.83s -> 783.51s]  about this right now, this moment, just me talking to my friends here in this call.
[783.51s -> 786.31s]  It's starting to realize he was going to be the next face of gaming.
[787.27s -> 791.83s]  Yeah. You're, you're, you're going to turn into like the, the, the face of, okay, who's the gamer?
[791.83s -> 795.83s]  All right. There he is. Let's interview him. There he is. He played that duck falling game.
[797.13s -> 801.21s]  I played the duck falling game and other meme streamer bait games. Um, and then I'm going to
[801.21s -> 805.61s]  start getting people to floss on New Year's Eve. It's going to be great. Yeah. But you'll actually
[805.61s -> 809.21s]  be able to do it. I mean, you live in New York, right? So, you know, the, the, the energy,
[809.21s -> 813.13s]  I know the people first to have to go, Hey, I'm walking. They know you. Yeah. They're like, Hey,
[813.13s -> 818.55s]  this is what's up, boy. Hey, I'll fly for you. New York. I just came from Katz's deli. How you
[818.55s -> 824.44s]  doing? Let's do a little dance. Is that, is, is the hub world? Hold on being too weird. Is the
[824.44s -> 828.92s]  procedural? Oh, no, no. Is the hub world have just other players just kind of hanging out? That's
[828.92s -> 833.80s]  what I meant. And I said procedural. Yes, it does. Random. Oh, just the wrong word.
[833.80s -> 839.48s]  Procedurally generated hub world. It sounded good at the moment, but it was completely wrong.
[839.48s -> 845.88s]  Sorry. Think of how absolutely fucking annoying that would be. Yeah. Procedurally generated hub
[845.88s -> 851.64s]  world. And it's always someplace new. Hey, I can't find you. It's because hub worlds are different,
[851.64s -> 857.85s]  dude. Yeah. Like, Oh yeah. I can't move past it. Blacksmith is like on a whole nother level. You
[857.85s -> 863.18s]  have to go in an elevator and go up this time. That'd be such, that would be so annoying. Okay.
[863.18s -> 867.18s]  Let's see. We have like five minutes, right? We've got, we've gotten just about five minutes
[867.18s -> 873.26s]  and that you guys know about to be excited about this. The lore of like this game or like hive
[873.26s -> 878.86s]  worlds in general. No, tell me. I could tell you. I'm actually quite the, uh, go on. It's not then
[878.86s -> 888.46s]  let's hear it. Let's hear it. Yeah. In the year 300, there was, there was the main character named
[888.46s -> 898.33s]  snot. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, sweating pressures on now. I don't even know. I can't even begin to fake my
[898.33s -> 901.53s]  way through it guys. I don't know a single thing about Warhammer. Yeah. That's the word really
[901.53s -> 907.37s]  raised his hand in class and well, there were night elves, there were orcs and they were undead.
[908.01s -> 915.88s]  That's always the worst. They fought in storm wind. Wait, is the year 40,000 Warhammer 40,000. It
[915.88s -> 921.08s]  means we are, what is the 40,000 is the, the amount of time Pat, somebody know this?
[925.34s -> 929.74s]  No, I think it's 40,000 years later, right? It was like desperately reading his chat for
[929.74s -> 934.54s]  someone to save him with this. No, no, no, no, no. I, I used to play a shitload of Warhammer 40k.
[934.54s -> 942.17s]  Okay. Please let me, let me do this. The Warhammer 40k takes place in the timeline of Warhammer,
[942.17s -> 955.45s]  right? Okay. It's the four milky way galaxy from human prehistory up through the 41st millennium
[955.45s -> 960.01s]  in the Warhammer 40,000 setting throughout. Yeah. Preparative references to present dates
[960.01s -> 967.78s]  will be made with respect to the original Imperial calendar used before the birth of the great rift.
[967.78s -> 971.62s]  That sounds like you're reading off of Wikipedia. I think he just accessed the
[971.62s -> 977.51s]  deep annals of his brain, dude. That was like, I just had to pull it up. Yeah. I said, I like the
[977.51s -> 984.49s]  kind of, um, one of my favorite, uh, I love the orcs. They were awesome. Yeah. The orcs are great.
[985.05s -> 990.95s]  They are pretty cool. What are they? What was the, uh, the, the main orc? What was his name?
[990.95s -> 1004.81s]  Gork. His name is Gork. No, no, no, no. His name, Grim Skull, Grim Skull. Yep. He had the chainsaw
[1004.81s -> 1012.97s]  and like this. See, I know. Yeah. I know the song. When I did the orc massage video game,
[1012.97s -> 1019.77s]  I included the song. I went orcs, orcs, orcs, orcs. Oh yeah. That's the song. Oh, that's right. You
[1019.77s -> 1024.89s]  do really get around with the games you play between plastic duck game and everything in
[1024.89s -> 1031.19s]  between from orc massage to 40 K. It's a duck game. Yeah. I have, you know, I think here's everything.
[1031.19s -> 1037.80s]  I am actually like very excited to play this. I'm so happy. I am like, this is my first level
[1037.80s -> 1041.64s]  I'm ever going to queue up for. Okay. This is going to be fun. It's going to be fun. Do I have
[1041.64s -> 1047.99s]  to meet you guys somewhere? Uh, I think we just get pulled in, right? I think. Yeah. Once the,
[1047.99s -> 1052.55s]  once I queue up. Yeah. We just, we had literally three minutes. Are you guys ready? Three minutes.
[1053.27s -> 1058.63s]  I'm excited. I don't know what is going to happen. And I actually kind of, I actually kind of don't
[1058.63s -> 1067.27s]  know either. I know that something is a, something is about to happen. Now, is this something
[1067.27s -> 1072.63s]  appropriate for level one players? I don't know. We will find out. Oh, that's a good question.
[1072.79s -> 1080.07s]  I'm sure we can handle it. Well, I don't, I don't think they would have, I don't think,
[1080.07s -> 1087.32s]  I think the part would have made that clear. I have this little prison jumpsuit. I think I can
[1087.32s -> 1091.88s]  handle anything. Yeah. So they've been dropping new maps every few days because of a, it's like
[1091.88s -> 1097.72s]  rolling out into, you know, the full launch. Yep. So we'll see what happens in two minutes.
[1099.77s -> 1104.33s]  Well, chat, this is the mission board. It's not quite like left for dead in the sense that you
[1104.33s -> 1108.25s]  just kind of go through a campaign. You just choose missions. They're like bounties. They're
[1108.25s -> 1112.81s]  timed and then you get money and experience. It's pretty neat. It's actually a very addictive loop.
[1113.69s -> 1119.93s]  Yeah. And they have different modifiers that can randomly get rolled on them. So for example,
[1119.93s -> 1125.21s]  like endless hoard. Another one I saw in the other beta was like lights out where all the
[1125.21s -> 1128.65s]  lights in the map are out and you basically need to bring flashlights to find your way everywhere.
[1128.65s -> 1136.47s]  It's like a horror version. Yeah, that's pretty cool. Here we go. You said that. Here it comes.
[1137.59s -> 1142.87s]  We have 60 seconds remaining. Oh, oh shit. Okay. Uh, I'm on the edge of my seat.
[1142.87s -> 1148.23s]  Is there drops enabled? I want drops. How do I get drops? New war zone conditions in 47 seconds.
[1150.36s -> 1155.56s]  Alert global condition alert. New war zone conditions in 40 seconds. I just repeated what
[1155.56s -> 1159.32s]  you just said. Yeah. There's going to be a meteor that hits tomato town.
[1162.20s -> 1166.82s]  It got wiped out. All right. So give me a quick little tutorial here. What's the, all right.
[1166.82s -> 1171.22s]  I know F is charge. I know that I can do an uppercut tutorial with 20 seconds left. Yeah.
[1171.22s -> 1174.90s]  Yeah. Look, it's time for everyone to get, by the way, I'm having a little bit of trouble looking
[1174.90s -> 1181.62s]  in the chat here. I don't see anybody spamming. Let's go. I mean, what the heck's going on here?
[1181.62s -> 1185.42s]  Maybe I'm being, I just, my glasses a little bit here. I don't really see it. I did that
[1185.42s -> 1190.39s]  tutorial. And the second they gave me like a fourth ability I can do, I just started
[1190.39s -> 1200.31s]  just kind of pushing buttons randomly. I got a little overwhelmed. Oh, it's happening. Should
[1200.31s -> 1204.55s]  I be seeing something? It's still pretty, all the missions went away. Yeah. The missions are
[1204.55s -> 1215.93s]  gone and it's just quick play. Why do we quick play? Uh, I don't know. I don't know what happened.
[1216.73s -> 1222.97s]  Is that Disney castle? Yeah, that's the magic kingdom, dude. So do we just do a quick play?
[1225.85s -> 1230.25s]  The missions are rebooting. I think maybe we'll give it a second because it's a very specific
[1230.97s -> 1240.49s]  mission name. Okay. I put it in the chat. So we have 239 hours we have to wait. That's enough
[1240.49s -> 1245.85s]  time to talk about the lore of the game, I think. Maybe not. Actually not. Yeah. There's so much
[1245.85s -> 1253.91s]  lore in this stupid game. Let's see. I'm a huge lore nerd though. So I will talk as long as you let
[1253.91s -> 1259.99s]  me. Are you actually like a big Warhammer like Ben? You are, right? Yeah. I only found it. Oh,
[1260.23s -> 1266.87s]  it just popped back up. Oh, power supply interruption. That's the one. Okay. There's
[1266.87s -> 1277.45s]  it go. It's going to go at level two. Hold on one sec. Oh, no. Okay. Magistrate Obelette. All right.
[1279.98s -> 1286.31s]  Let's go. Oh, it is lights out. Holy shit. Lights out. Wait, is it? Wait, is it the power supply
[1286.31s -> 1291.11s]  place? Yeah. Power supply interruption. Wait, I'm freaked out. Oh, it's going to be freaky.
[1291.11s -> 1297.70s]  We need to bring a flashlight. I just have this terrible little sword that I found in the trash.
[1297.70s -> 1301.46s]  I don't have anything. I don't have a flashlight. You'll have something, Snot, if you just.
[1303.06s -> 1308.74s]  I'm like babysitting these pajama kids. I'm ready. This Lays gun has a flashlight,
[1308.74s -> 1315.24s]  so I'll bring this. All right. Let's see if I got a flashlight. Oh, that'll be good.
[1316.06s -> 1321.82s]  Wait, do we need flashlights? It's going to be dark, man. Power supply interruption. Press I,
[1323.10s -> 1327.77s]  and then click on your weapon, and you'll see an icon that looks like a flashlight.
[1327.77s -> 1334.78s]  It's three icons on your weapon, and the right one should be a flashlight. Mine's a knife. Well. Oh,
[1334.78s -> 1340.06s]  no. Well, shit. Augren's are traditionally stupid. I don't know if you could know how to function
[1340.06s -> 1347.32s]  a flashlight. Very good. What is your weapon? I have the default stuff. Just a cudgel of some kind.
[1348.04s -> 1352.36s]  It's like, but it's like a makeshift club, it looks like. Did we naturally all pick
[1352.36s -> 1357.08s]  a different class out of the four? That's cool. That's actually pretty remarkable.
[1357.08s -> 1362.02s]  That's the first time I've seen that. All right. Here it is. This is the big moment.
[1363.06s -> 1372.10s]  Oh, my Lord. You're massive. Look, he's counting his fingers. He's not like his iPhone.
[1378.46s -> 1382.78s]  It's the Ork massage guy. Stop bringing up Ork massage so that I don't have to say it in the call
[1382.78s -> 1388.14s]  anymore. That's going to be your next interview. One hundred percent. This is us. This is us. This
[1388.14s -> 1394.28s]  is OK. Calm down. How cool are we? Yeah, we look great. Thought I just crashed the game. All right.
[1394.28s -> 1400.09s]  Here we go. It's time to play. This is definitely darker than it usually is. Smoosh, Copernicus,
[1400.09s -> 1408.49s]  and Vine. Dark time. Four of us. Are there Fortnite emotes? Before we begin, guys. Not entirely.
[1408.49s -> 1415.53s]  Sorry, I don't have somebody to be flashlight lead. I got. Can you see my flashlight? I can.
[1415.53s -> 1429.75s]  Yes. OK. Oh, I love the acting. That's a Tom T. I don't know. It's like a numpty.
[1431.11s -> 1435.19s]  What's the flashlight button in case they get separated? Mouse five on your.
[1435.27s -> 1443.06s]  We already are separated. Oh, Chris. Oops. Oh, what happened?
[1444.10s -> 1448.90s]  There's some zombie friends down here infected. Oh, it's fucking dark. This is really dark.
[1452.94s -> 1456.78s]  Are these guys confirmed bad or are we just killing like. Oh, they're heretics.
[1456.78s -> 1460.94s]  They're they're heretics. And aren't they infected with like worms? Yeah, they're infected with.
[1461.90s -> 1466.87s]  I can't see anything. If you look closely, they got like postules all over them, postules,
[1466.87s -> 1471.11s]  whatever. Yeah. And when you hit them with a shovel, maggots fall out of their face.
[1471.11s -> 1474.95s]  Really? That's gross. That's why you brought the shovel. I knew there was some meta reason.
[1474.95s -> 1478.71s]  What's this thing? That's the only one I have. The only melee I have, but sure.
[1479.91s -> 1487.83s]  All right. You want to see some cool shit? Let's go. Oh, I like. He's got a flamethrower. What? Yeah.
[1487.99s -> 1491.35s]  Yeah. I came to purge some freaking heretics.
[1495.19s -> 1498.55s]  Feels pretty good. It is so dark. This is usually well lit.
[1499.72s -> 1503.80s]  I haven't done a sewer level at all. Have you? Yeah, you have. So.
[1509.86s -> 1516.98s]  Did I kill it? Oh, it's not. Help me. I think a dog pushed me. That wasn't intentional.
[1517.62s -> 1525.51s]  I think it's been the only one that brought a flashlight. I think so. Oh, my God. Oh,
[1525.51s -> 1528.71s]  you can see them glowing in the dark over there. That's so cool. Look at that. Oh,
[1528.71s -> 1540.95s]  that's terrifying. Throw a grenade. Grenade out. Let's go. I'm chopping them up. I'm chopping them
[1540.95s -> 1550.30s]  up. Ow. Oh, my God. I keep shooting you guys. I'm sorry. Is there friendly fire, right? I don't
[1550.30s -> 1555.10s]  think so. There actually isn't friendly fire. They could just get upset. Like the characters
[1555.10s -> 1561.02s]  are like, oh, watch what you're doing, mate. So good. I'm too much of an impact to sound like.
[1561.02s -> 1565.74s]  Hey, why are you targeting me? Ammo if anyone needs it. I don't mix in some like
[1566.62s -> 1572.62s]  Warhammer space terminology. Would you hit me with the blast the end of the of this of this laser
[1573.34s -> 1579.74s]  laser gun? Oh, my God. I threw a box in that guy's head. What's the curse word that replaces
[1579.82s -> 1585.82s]  fucking this groggin? What is it? That does not have the same punch to it.
[1586.70s -> 1593.02s]  So one of my chat just said dirty sci fi is so cool. It is literally a great way to describe it.
[1593.02s -> 1599.46s]  Yeah. Oh, my God. I just I have a brick as a grenade. It doesn't explode.
[1600.74s -> 1605.14s]  So the Ogryn just throw off the whole box of grenades. They can't figure out.
[1606.10s -> 1610.58s]  That's so funny. Individual ones. I think there's a sniper over there.
[1610.66s -> 1620.84s]  It's my mouth. I tried, but I've got this mush. Do we got to find some more flashlights? I can't
[1620.84s -> 1627.77s]  see it. Oh, no, I'm in trouble. I'm in trouble. Help. Also, they're suppressing us right now.
[1632.98s -> 1636.26s]  You have to like get out of the way of suppressing fire. Otherwise, your aim
[1636.26s -> 1642.58s]  gets all screwed up. Are we going to hear that ticking sound? That's an explosive guy, like a
[1642.58s -> 1646.90s]  boomer. Oh, but do you need grenades? He's just going to run out. Actually, yeah, I do. I threw
[1646.90s -> 1655.13s]  a grab those. It is a lot scarier when you can't see them. Just listen. There is that light.
[1656.73s -> 1674.82s]  OK, got him near us. I got you. You look like a monster on the ground. Just try to keep my
[1674.82s -> 1679.38s]  flashlight active, which means melee is not a good option because then it gets. What does that sound?
[1679.38s -> 1686.42s]  It sounds like a sword. Why are there so many people down here? What are they doing? Oh, my
[1686.42s -> 1691.94s]  goodness. It was a rave. It was a Matrix Revolutions rave. That seems like the best time of your life
[1691.94s -> 1700.36s]  coming down here. It's been a weekend getting sweaty. Oh, music, guys. Music just started.
[1701.48s -> 1708.31s]  I'm going to die. I can't see, guys. I think I'm falling. What the hell happened to you, Snot?
[1708.31s -> 1711.43s]  I think these guys pushed me. They picked me up and gave me a wedgie.
[1712.39s -> 1716.79s]  Fucking walked off. What did I do? Oh, my God. Wait, where did Smoosh go?
[1718.84s -> 1723.88s]  Smoosh is dead. It's dark. We are in trouble. Everyone just walk off the ledges.
[1725.00s -> 1730.84s]  I seriously think I did walk just straight off. It's dark. We can get you back. We just need to
[1730.84s -> 1738.68s]  find you. OK. He's the only one with a flashlight. His entire job is to just keep it trained on the
[1738.68s -> 1743.40s]  way forward. Yeah, this is actually pretty cool, though. So this is going to do more arson. Does
[1743.40s -> 1748.20s]  this level exist in the game? Like just the game right now? But this is like a wow. Now you can't
[1748.20s -> 1755.96s]  see pretty much. Yeah. All right. I think I think they just wanted us to be like scared. They were
[1755.96s -> 1762.68s]  like, yeah, we're going to make sure I'm scared. Yeah. Have a dark environment for him. I
[1762.68s -> 1770.49s]  accidentally ran off the cliff. Yeah, we'll get you back. It's OK. Oh, my God. What the fuck is
[1770.65s -> 1774.97s]  this? What is it? What is it? What is it? I have never seen this before. I've never seen this.
[1774.97s -> 1781.45s]  What is that? We're so screwed. We are so screwed. I don't have a hemo. That was actually terrifying.
[1783.00s -> 1789.48s]  Smoosh, are you OK? You're not OK. I'm just observing. Holy fuck. OK. Help someone. He's
[1789.64s -> 1797.24s]  killing me so bad. I don't even know who to attack. Sorry. He's just annihilating you.
[1798.84s -> 1805.08s]  Help me. Help. Just fucking sweat. Oh, he's so close. He's dead. He's dead. He's dead. You got
[1805.08s -> 1810.07s]  him? He's dead. But we're going to get snot up. Oh, my God. Just leave me. There's another special.
[1810.07s -> 1816.15s]  There's another special infected. What the hell is happening? That was insane. That was a real
[1816.15s -> 1821.46s]  fucking demon. We just all got downed. That was terrifying. Wow. All right. That was cool.
[1823.26s -> 1827.58s]  Do we need to go back to the lobby and buy some things? I've got I've got a couple ideas for
[1827.58s -> 1833.90s]  supplies. Yeah, I'm going to bring a flashlight. We need flashlights. Yeah, for real. I don't I
[1833.90s -> 1840.15s]  don't think you can actually afford flashlights at the moment. Damn. You just really said that.
[1840.15s -> 1846.55s]  I said that. There's a leveling system, too. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's how you unlock more weapon
[1846.55s -> 1853.11s]  classes and, you know, stuff in the hub. Full four player co-op, by the way. That's the view,
[1853.11s -> 1856.55s]  obviously. You can play it alone if you want to as well. You don't have to be with four people.
[1858.66s -> 1865.86s]  That was very intense. The music kicked in, too. And that got my I got my blood pumping.
[1865.86s -> 1871.22s]  I I've been playing this game for like 30 hours now over the last week. And I did not I've never
[1871.22s -> 1874.66s]  seen that entity. That was the first they just added them. I think right now. Maybe that's what
[1874.66s -> 1878.66s]  they wanted us to wait for. Yeah, I think that's what they wanted to close my eyes. I'm not going
[1878.66s -> 1886.20s]  to lie. I believe that it was just like too scary lapsed on this floor with like this hallowed
[1886.20s -> 1890.68s]  frosty ground around it. And then I walked up to it and it just animated and went after my freaking
[1890.68s -> 1896.60s]  neck. It was terrifying. That thing was doing like 10 attacks a second, by the way. Yeah. Yeah. I
[1898.04s -> 1902.84s]  no idea how to deal with that. And then show me where you buy flashlights so that maybe one day
[1902.84s -> 1907.88s]  when I find a pretty little thing, I think you need to be level two. Unbelievable. All right.
[1907.88s -> 1915.37s]  It's all right. We'll manage. We'll manage. We should do a level one mission now and then maybe
[1915.37s -> 1921.29s]  come back to that one since it's there. Yeah. Let's let's we're going to the goal of this whole
[1921.29s -> 1924.49s]  thing is to beat that mission. Well, let's start with like an easy one, right? Like somebody to
[1924.49s -> 1930.41s]  get us. Yeah, we got this consignment yard HL 1736 mission, which we could probably do that way.
[1930.41s -> 1935.88s]  You guys can level up and buy another weapon. Yeah, that was crazy, though. All right.
[1935.88s -> 1942.76s]  I was with this one. This is also a new map that just came out today. I think the relay station
[1942.76s -> 1948.15s]  TRS 150. I do that. What difficulty level is this one? Yeah, we could do that one. That's cool.
[1948.79s -> 1955.30s]  You can crack in. Someone said you can upgrade your health or like vigor. Can you do that? Yeah.
[1955.30s -> 1961.86s]  So if you press I and then go to feats every five levels, you unlock basically a new perk
[1961.86s -> 1967.22s]  for your class. And that's how you kind of build a you can build like a build for your
[1967.22s -> 1973.48s]  your how your play style is. We got you. And that includes like, you know, more tanky damage.
[1974.04s -> 1979.75s]  OK, I see. Yeah, I didn't see that before. But no, I can't do it anyway right now. But yeah,
[1979.75s -> 1986.70s]  drops. There are drops enabled. You guys have drops on yours, too. Yeah. How do you do that?
[1986.78s -> 1994.06s]  You've got to connect your which to the Warhammer thing in game or out game. It's on the on Twitch's
[1994.06s -> 2001.08s]  like dashboard. I'll do it another time. Can I get some of your drops? Yeah. Open one of our
[2001.08s -> 2004.36s]  streams and leave it on. Actually, I'll do that. I'll do that for myself. That's a good idea.
[2007.10s -> 2010.86s]  Wait, you just leave the stream on? Yes. Leave it on the background.
[2012.06s -> 2017.50s]  Get free items. But I have to connect, though. No, you can connect later. It tracks your watch
[2017.50s -> 2022.90s]  time first. All right. Looks like I'm watching Jerma while we're doing this. All right. Hey,
[2022.90s -> 2026.02s]  welcome. Hey, Jerma, I'm watching you right now. What's up, buddy?
[2032.84s -> 2039.51s]  All right, we can see. Chad, I'll enable drops if I ever play this again on stream,
[2039.51s -> 2051.70s]  and I probably will. But next time, this is much less scary. I think I just tried to shoot this
[2051.70s -> 2060.82s]  innocent guy coming. What a hero guy. I like that the door. Look at the look at the door handle.
[2060.82s -> 2066.86s]  It's just a skull. Yeah, I need to get one of these from my house. So it's not just the skull.
[2066.86s -> 2070.06s]  Apparently, the four key universals are called servitors, and they're actually
[2070.94s -> 2077.70s]  somewhat conscious humans. Really? Brains still intact that, you know, they're basically programmed
[2077.70s -> 2083.94s]  their brains to function for their purpose, like opening the door to be a servitor. That would be
[2083.94s -> 2090.50s]  just a pleasant existence. You wouldn't have a whole lot to worry about. I know. Yeah, you can
[2090.50s -> 2095.30s]  find them like there's like one for like drying your hands in the bathroom. There's like a hand
[2095.30s -> 2101.02s]  drying servitor. Are we all here? Your AI in this universe? Yeah. Well, so it's like doing a little
[2101.02s -> 2109.46s]  bit. Yeah, there's a lot of really weird, dark, like grim dark shit in the 40k universe. I know
[2109.46s -> 2120.10s]  there's a god emperor, which is also very dune. Game looks really nice. Yeah. Oh, Dave in my chat.
[2120.10s -> 2124.98s]  I don't know why I said that. Dave, what option do I turn off for better performance if I need to
[2124.98s -> 2134.89s]  ray tracing? You want to turn that off? That's just wondering. Just wanted to make sure they
[2134.89s -> 2143.58s]  were dead. I'm just checking the work there. Smush. Oh, Adam, you have a flame thrower.
[2143.58s -> 2151.72s]  I got a freaking flame thrower. That's pretty sick. The guy here. Every class gets a couple
[2151.72s -> 2158.50s]  weapons that are unique to them. I have a slap. Are you kidding me? Big meaty slap. What? Wait,
[2158.50s -> 2162.66s]  what's mine? Do you know what mine are? Should be if you have a button on your mouse.
[2165.24s -> 2169.98s]  Oh, yeah, I've got a force push. I'm basically basically like in Star Wars.
[2171.10s -> 2177.66s]  So this happens a lot where the ogren of the team gets shot a lot. Yep.
[2178.38s -> 2181.90s]  Because doing my job in the melee and then I end up shooting them a ton.
[2184.86s -> 2197.99s]  He's so big. He's like a door. He's like a door. I am like a big door. You say there's not friendly
[2197.99s -> 2205.99s]  fire. They just get mad at you. It doesn't feel like you wait. Watch out. Be careful.
[2210.84s -> 2221.29s]  You shot me in the back. I keep shooting German. Oh, my God. I knew me green fire.
[2221.93s -> 2227.61s]  Oh, look at this. It's wildfire. The world looks so cool. This is beautiful. Guys,
[2227.61s -> 2231.69s]  we need to unbolt this thing and take it home. This thing's probably worth a lot.
[2232.33s -> 2236.33s]  Probably 40. Who's crying? The zealots, man.
[2239.45s -> 2244.39s]  Heretics. They picked the wrong God and they're just salty about it. Yeah.
[2245.51s -> 2251.19s]  It's nice to know that things in the future are still very. Oh, we're going outside.
[2254.52s -> 2256.68s]  Wait, this is the first time we've gone outside in this game.
[2259.30s -> 2261.86s]  Reloading. Oh, my God. I haven't yet. I haven't seen this either.
[2262.66s -> 2269.16s]  Hang on. Let me just grab some. Got him. Look at that beautiful, beautiful skyline. Breathe in
[2269.16s -> 2276.04s]  that fresh air. More discipline would not go amiss. Is it not the measure by which warriors are
[2276.04s -> 2286.42s]  judged? I just have been following you around and hitting the thing that you hit again after it's
[2286.42s -> 2294.10s]  dead. OK, you know, you can. What happened? Oh, dude, the lights are on. What is your
[2294.74s -> 2304.23s]  Falcon? Pick me up and a fucking Falcon. Yeah, I look like I tried to peek over.
[2304.23s -> 2307.67s]  I tried to peek over the edge and look down there, but it did not work.
[2309.67s -> 2313.08s]  I keep forgetting there's a dodge. The dodge is so much fun.
[2314.04s -> 2322.28s]  It's just what's the dodge again? In a direction. Oh, yeah. Was the space.
[2326.94s -> 2331.42s]  There are difficulties on the levels, too. Oh, yeah. That's awesome. So this is a level one.
[2332.06s -> 2336.62s]  One way we tried first was to it goes all the way up to five. So by the time you get this
[2337.18s -> 2344.10s]  five ones, you got to be like, no, the highest level of that chart before.
[2345.06s -> 2348.15s]  And they're they're pretty damn difficult,
[2349.19s -> 2352.78s]  but really satisfying. Just makes you like work as a team really carefully.
[2352.78s -> 2356.94s]  But you also get better weapons as you go. Mm hmm. You have tried to five?
[2357.74s -> 2365.37s]  Well, no way. Oh, you haven't. OK, a lock. Everybody in here? OK, good. Yeah.
[2366.49s -> 2373.06s]  I want to get some new weapons. So this is also a medical station, which we don't need right now
[2373.06s -> 2377.78s]  because we're only on an easy difficulty, but you can heal on these. And every time you go down,
[2377.78s -> 2381.22s]  you get this like purple bar on your health and that just reduces your max health.
[2381.22s -> 2384.74s]  And whenever you feel these, it gets very, very. Yeah. Oh, ammo and stuff.
[2385.70s -> 2389.54s]  And this guy's still alive. This is a server. This guy's still alive. Yeah.
[2392.74s -> 2398.28s]  Look, he looks so uncomfortable. Oh, that's right. I forgot about that.
[2399.48s -> 2404.22s]  Just ask us to take him with us because he's fucking lonely and does nothing better to do.
[2404.22s -> 2407.50s]  That's sad. What's happening over here? We get to run for you guys.
[2407.58s -> 2411.34s]  Oh, my God. That was Jerma. I thought Jerma had picked you up.
[2411.34s -> 2416.14s]  It was smacking you, dude. Yeah, I was outside looking looking at the cool stuff.
[2416.14s -> 2420.46s]  And then I see fucking a giant ochre. Yeah, they're all just staring at
[2420.46s -> 2423.66s]  the medical station while it's getting. Damn, look at this.
[2423.66s -> 2426.70s]  I'm getting overwhelmed like sensory overload. It looks like Mad Max.
[2426.70s -> 2429.34s]  Do you love it? When are we going to when are we going to get the go get us?
[2430.54s -> 2432.38s]  Well, I don't know what that is when I'm wait.
[2433.74s -> 2436.54s]  Is that like those the blimpkins or whatever I called them before them?
[2436.70s -> 2439.90s]  Oh, yeah. Then the good because you'll know.
[2440.86s -> 2445.54s]  This guy's played 40K. You can tell. Oh, we've got a whole.
[2445.54s -> 2462.22s]  By the way, go get a time, I think. Oh, my God. That dog scared the shit out of me.
[2462.22s -> 2466.02s]  Help me. It's not what we're going to do with you.
[2466.82s -> 2481.62s]  I need to stay in the background. Jess, I think we're good.
[2484.39s -> 2487.27s]  I'll get out of here. Heretic gather thermoelectric cells.
[2487.27s -> 2489.51s]  OK, we have to find thermoelectric cells. All right.
[2490.47s -> 2496.98s]  It should be near the good guys. I don't know what that is.
[2496.98s -> 2500.50s]  Still hold on. You'll know in just about five seconds.
[2501.40s -> 2507.48s]  Two, three, four, five, six, maybe. Hold on.
[2509.27s -> 2515.50s]  Maybe another five seconds or so. What are you looking for?
[2515.50s -> 2518.78s]  There's no payoff for this. There's no out for this bit.
[2519.34s -> 2521.26s]  There is, but I don't know if it's going to happen.
[2521.82s -> 2527.83s]  I got one of the power supplies. You did?
[2527.83s -> 2534.14s]  Yeah. Nice. Where did you find it? It was up top over here.
[2537.82s -> 2539.90s]  No, I'll just look over here and hope for the best.
[2540.86s -> 2544.78s]  Oh, that one was on my map. Oh, over here. I got another one.
[2544.78s -> 2547.22s]  Oh, you know, you got it. Wow.
[2548.42s -> 2561.85s]  Let's wait. I see one.
[2561.85s -> 2572.54s]  I see one neighbor. Don't let him up.
[2582.54s -> 2586.12s]  You guys get the other one. It's here.
[2586.12s -> 2587.64s]  It's here. You guys are beating my ass.
[2588.20s -> 2589.96s]  I'm coming, snot. Oh, I'm coming.
[2590.60s -> 2593.00s]  Did we ever resolve that go good a bit?
[2593.80s -> 2596.20s]  Not yet. Maybe. Oh, we got a lot.
[2596.20s -> 2599.00s]  There's a lot. There's a lot. Go long, dog.
[2600.44s -> 2603.40s]  My grandfather used to call zucchini go boots.
[2604.04s -> 2606.44s]  It's not a zucchini. No, I know.
[2606.44s -> 2611.88s]  But yeah, now the thing that we're that I'm waiting for is not a zucchini,
[2612.76s -> 2615.54s]  but that's you door. That's a zucchini.
[2615.54s -> 2616.34s]  Is that what you said?
[2622.34s -> 2623.38s]  Dog help dog.
[2629.29s -> 2632.57s]  It's like door dashing one single Gatorade. It's like, come on, man.
[2636.31s -> 2637.67s]  You drink the whole thing.
[2637.67s -> 2640.39s]  I do open the door and grab it and small thing in front of them.
[2640.39s -> 2643.11s]  There's no size chuggy cheese pizza once for my birthday.
[2643.11s -> 2645.27s]  Last ones over here. That's nice.
[2645.91s -> 2649.51s]  Yeah, I got to customize what was on it and they put every topping and it cost $80.
[2650.71s -> 2652.31s]  What? Wait, what?
[2652.95s -> 2654.79s]  That's clown pizza at that point.
[2654.79s -> 2657.03s]  Yeah, it was a little they put little diamonds on it.
[2657.83s -> 2659.43s]  All right, we got sardines and they put
[2664.02s -> 2665.22s]  the rest of the toppings.
[2665.22s -> 2666.98s]  We go through this even eat sardines.
[2666.98s -> 2668.02s]  Yeah, let me go through it now.
[2670.30s -> 2671.50s]  Oh, behind us. What?
[2674.33s -> 2675.21s]  Throwing a grenade.
[2675.21s -> 2677.85s]  Started back up. Grind them up.
[2677.85s -> 2681.14s]  Yeah, seriously. Oh, that wasn't so bad.
[2685.22s -> 2688.66s]  Don't forget that you can tag special enemies to make it easier for everyone to see.
[2691.70s -> 2694.26s]  Oh, good job, Charlie implemented it.
[2695.78s -> 2696.50s]  I love that overhead.
[2698.82s -> 2699.62s]  I mean, it's not sorry.
[2699.62s -> 2700.82s]  It's not please.
[2700.82s -> 2702.82s]  We use our names here.
[2702.82s -> 2703.32s]  All right.
[2703.32s -> 2705.08s]  It's the same for the untested soul.
[2708.41s -> 2710.57s]  So you say we're playing on easy right now?
[2710.57s -> 2711.69s]  Yeah, this is the easiest.
[2711.69s -> 2712.57s]  Wow. All right.
[2712.57s -> 2714.80s]  This is this has got some.
[2714.80s -> 2718.64s]  I think difficulty is actually dependent on each person.
[2718.64s -> 2721.84s]  I think I set mine a little higher, which is why I'm dying so much.
[2722.48s -> 2725.04s]  So I see that explains it.
[2726.08s -> 2728.30s]  Who has the flame thrower?
[2728.30s -> 2728.78s]  That's awesome.
[2729.58s -> 2731.74s]  That's me. The results bastard here.
[2732.46s -> 2733.58s]  Another. Whoa.
[2733.58s -> 2737.69s]  OK. I mean, you know, there are all baskets.
[2746.08s -> 2746.88s]  No, not quite.
[2756.60s -> 2757.24s]  Oh, my goodness.
[2757.24s -> 2760.04s]  Milly range is much longer than you think, says a chat member.
[2760.04s -> 2763.92s]  OK. Oh, yeah.
[2763.92s -> 2765.68s]  Dodging and blocking is your friend.
[2765.68s -> 2766.72s]  Yeah, it is.
[2766.72s -> 2769.28s]  You can also hold right click and then left click to push.
[2770.40s -> 2772.80s]  Oh, yeah. And then you get a special attack after that, too.
[2772.80s -> 2774.56s]  Yeah. They told me all this.
[2774.56s -> 2776.56s]  I just can't remember it all.
[2776.56s -> 2778.00s]  Yes. I mean, it's a heck of a game.
[2778.16s -> 2780.32s]  To write this down on the like, the palm of my hand.
[2780.32s -> 2781.52s]  So I can do you guys see this?
[2782.91s -> 2786.96s]  What is it the like one of them is just stretchy.
[2786.96s -> 2788.16s]  It looks like Pokemon pilot.
[2789.20s -> 2792.80s]  Well, we just killed like 50 of them.
[2792.80s -> 2794.40s]  Yeah, but one of them got real stretchy.
[2795.52s -> 2796.52s]  That's all right.
[2796.52s -> 2797.24s]  It's fine.
[2797.24s -> 2797.80s]  It's the chaos.
[2798.76s -> 2799.40s]  Chaos. Yeah.
[2800.12s -> 2800.68s]  We'll crouch.
[2802.83s -> 2805.20s]  Oh, I'm here to stay together.
[2806.44s -> 2807.80s]  Low hanging Pokemon joke.
[2807.80s -> 2808.76s]  I don't think it does anything.
[2809.64s -> 2811.55s]  There's a lot of view.
[2811.55s -> 2817.80s]  Distance can we click this? I don't think this is a button. I could have just declared. I have found a switch
[2821.04s -> 2823.04s]  All right, enter
[2827.78s -> 2832.88s]  Plastil is what's plastic is that just money to buy some flamer and they have the best sound effect in the game in my
[2832.88s -> 2836.38s]  Opinion it's the sound of like a fucking gas stove turning on like the
[2836.90s -> 2839.08s]  Right before they fire. Oh, that's a cool
[2839.74s -> 2843.93s]  Do we have to bring sound design in this are incredible is incredible?
[2846.12s -> 2851.48s]  Maybe class steel is current in this level for so I wonder if there's a I guess we have to do if you kill
[2851.48s -> 2853.72s]  Anything or maybe it's bugged
[2853.88s -> 2857.38s]  It says enters station. It's probably just one of these side paths
[2858.16s -> 2860.91s]  Maybe up. Oh
[2861.55s -> 2866.23s]  Also, I called I called the psycher a freak a freeze. Yeah, I heard that. Yeah, so that was
[2866.83s -> 2873.27s]  It's not just very nice to be working on a team where people just are shitty with each other. Oh, here we go
[2873.27s -> 2874.83s]  Yeah
[2874.83s -> 2877.08s]  Yeah
[2877.08s -> 2882.01s]  I'll take care of that
[2882.17s -> 2887.87s]  Yeah, it's interesting because I was playing this yesterday. I was like, oh man, there's no map button
[2887.87s -> 2894.75s]  I've gotten so used to having map buttons that I'm always opening and yet I had almost no problem navigating the levels
[2894.75s -> 2896.75s]  I feel like they're they're pretty
[2897.99s -> 2900.99s]  They seem vast, but you know where to go
[2902.83s -> 2904.83s]  They also have a little
[2905.83s -> 2911.67s]  Like weenies here like this freakin little arrow that goes aiming at you and then he pulled a sword out instead
[2912.43s -> 2914.43s]  See where to go
[2918.35s -> 2920.35s]  So snot and me could use this
[2922.99s -> 2927.71s]  One spot left. Yes, the purple is that your max health reduced because they've been at times you've gone down
[2929.91s -> 2931.91s]  It'll fix it so this fixes
[2934.83s -> 2942.47s]  You didn't think the the medical station man, which is a little rude he hasn't taught he hasn't spoken to somebody in like six years
[2944.47s -> 2946.47s]  Behind you Johnny cab
[2957.31s -> 2960.35s]  God there's a lot of detail. Yeah, I was gonna say this is
[2961.11s -> 2970.96s]  But immense if I say immensely detailed I like all the clutter it really just feels so
[2972.08s -> 2975.80s]  claustrophobic and this is the level that's outside like every level you're like
[2977.42s -> 2978.94s]  constantly indoors
[2978.94s -> 2981.22s]  Kind of want to see maybe this is not a good idea
[2981.22s -> 2985.98s]  I kind of want to see what this looks like with ray tracing on high for a second. I go in here
[2987.98s -> 2995.31s]  I love the slap. Hello the sound of it's so good to write
[2998.07s -> 3006.06s]  Can you guys hear me yeah ray tracing on my game crashed? Oh, no. Yeah, see that ray tracing man. I've tried to warn me
[3009.46s -> 3011.46s]  You can reconnect yeah
[3012.50s -> 3014.50s]  That's good, thankfully
[3017.40s -> 3018.80s]  Guy
[3018.80s -> 3020.80s]  Someone said what the fuck did he expect?
[3021.32s -> 3023.32s]  expected ray tracing to turn on
[3023.96s -> 3026.48s]  Dude if you turn one of the known bugs, I think is ray tracing
[3027.12s -> 3032.40s]  if you turn ray tracing on in general like in the middle of any game you get your computer just kind of goes like
[3033.40s -> 3037.44s]  Should I should have known it's not like it's the first time in the first game. But yeah
[3038.04s -> 3042.00s]  Aren't they doing a bunch of stability patches too. Yeah
[3046.12s -> 3051.68s]  Yeah, this is this is still the beta by the way, so it's what the 30th is when the game actually launches, right?
[3053.32s -> 3056.64s]  If you pre-order it you get access to the beta and comes out on the 30th
[3057.68s -> 3062.04s]  Wait, get away from the barrel. I accidentally hit that. Oh
[3064.72s -> 3067.88s]  Well, this is a bot oh wait, this is who Vinny was okay
[3079.36s -> 3082.56s]  This guy with the hair, this is me. I'm the pernick. I know I turned on
[3082.56s -> 3084.96s]  I saw like a funny haircut and I was like I have to hit this person
[3085.56s -> 3088.12s]  You look like count Olaf
[3088.72s -> 3090.00s]  Okay
[3090.00s -> 3092.00s]  Who's count Olaf?
[3096.16s -> 3101.03s]  Count Olaf from a bad time bad luck
[3105.55s -> 3107.75s]  Lemony Snicket presents bad luck bad time
[3108.71s -> 3113.89s]  Jiminy cricket. Hey, I'm back everyone. Hey, welcome back
[3114.25s -> 3117.13s]  You didn't miss much
[3117.37s -> 3123.71s]  Okay, did these explode? I'm not gonna try it you're do this. Oh, damn. You look great. Hey
[3125.07s -> 3128.11s]  Oh, wait, are we leaving without Vinny? You ever do this?
[3130.11s -> 3134.67s]  This make look like it's made of rubber. Yep. Yeah, I've done that. Yeah. Oh, yeah
[3134.67s -> 3140.39s]  You know, we're doing it. I people used to think I was a warlock in second grade when I figured that one out
[3140.39s -> 3142.39s]  Yeah, I got all the ladies with
[3142.55s -> 3148.23s]  Do you remember the origami or not origami but you'd make like a thing where you could tell fortunes where you'd open it up
[3149.83s -> 3158.00s]  Yeah, now, how about this rubber pencil origami paper and you draw the crazy ass on it
[3166.50s -> 3168.50s]  Yeah, oh
[3170.74s -> 3172.74s]  God was that oh my god
[3173.56s -> 3175.56s]  This thing's like coming out of the wall. I
[3180.51s -> 3184.83s]  Thought that was the character very close in my character's ear when you just did that
[3186.07s -> 3188.55s]  Thanks, I guess I was actually that was phenomenal
[3194.99s -> 3197.74s]  Well, this thing has a face
[3199.18s -> 3203.07s]  Look into these dudes do this is freaky. What is this thing?
[3204.59s -> 3207.71s]  What I just do
[3207.71s -> 3215.18s]  Look the eye and now I'm gonna use that fridge more bro. Oh the music's gonna kick it now. It's sick. I
[3215.86s -> 3220.42s]  Think this is the song that woke me up from bed. I was in this song came on and my eyes went wide open
[3220.42s -> 3224.16s]  Yeah, if this does not have no choice, but they give up and play too well dog
[3224.84s -> 3231.93s]  Oh
[3234.41s -> 3237.15s]  Dog it went through a wall dog
[3238.80s -> 3243.76s]  Okay, it came from a these we got to be careful up here these like holes in the walls up there
[3244.36s -> 3250.48s]  Those vents they spawn. Oh god. It's a little sus, but they spawn and what is this? Yeah, it's gross
[3250.48s -> 3254.32s]  Oh, look at this face. This is so cool. I mean, where's heresy but
[3258.64s -> 3260.64s]  In the face
[3261.80s -> 3266.11s]  I would take a piece of this off and I love what you're using a shovel
[3270.55s -> 3273.91s]  It's like black mold but actual sentient chaos God
[3274.59s -> 3280.73s]  It looks so friendly though. This on the hard difficulties would probably be very very difficult
[3281.01s -> 3287.33s]  It is so fun on the hard difficulties man. It's not we got to try it communicate constantly. Yeah, we should really try it
[3287.81s -> 3291.19s]  Grab that when you can your health. There's a health thing. I tagged
[3294.73s -> 3296.73s]  Bridges I
[3297.01s -> 3308.31s]  Look a little laser gun you got you might get one. You might be able to unlock one. I want out here
[3308.79s -> 3313.65s]  Do you not have any guns German? No, I have I have one gun. It's one. It's a one-shot shotgun. Oh

[3504.14s -> 3507.88s]  Wait, how do you see the man? We just started? I don't think there's

[3527.98s -> 3532.89s]  Bad hair
[3533.33s -> 3539.09s]  That machinery is like I would lose a hand to that. I would lose probably one or two
[3541.41s -> 3543.41s]  Everything here looks so dangerous
[3545.02s -> 3549.58s]  Meaty and dangerous. Yeah, there's the face
[3556.36s -> 3567.76s]  Data relay, I love the combos you can do like I can slap light swing heavy swing. It's fun. Yeah
[3569.10s -> 3576.70s]  some of the other weapons to like I'm using like a knife for example, and it's just incredibly fast swinging and you can like mix it up with
[3576.70s -> 3578.98s]  The overhead and a sweeping attack
[3580.06s -> 3581.93s]  There's something
[3581.93s -> 3585.01s]  What are they called chain swords in this universe? Yeah
[3586.05s -> 3590.97s]  There was one that they gave me in the tutorial and I was like, yeah, I need that. All right, we're gonna turn this off
[3592.36s -> 3594.56s]  Why was it doing? I don't know. It's a turn it off
[3595.16s -> 3599.97s]  Out of transition, I think it's over here. This is a reticle transmission
[3600.57s -> 3603.00s]  Hate that. Oh
[3603.00s -> 3611.95s]  Hold for signal. Oh, all right. We got let's group up on the way behind you. Oh, this is bad. All right
[3612.63s -> 3615.23s]  That's it. Let's turn out the flame up
[3616.15s -> 3620.92s]  Posted a good night. Hey lad. We got a weird guy over here
[3622.20s -> 3623.88s]  weird guy
[3623.88s -> 3631.63s]  It's this thing is just screaming
[3632.90s -> 3636.14s]  You know, you know, I'll tell you let me tell you about this game
[3636.18s -> 3640.50s]  There's a lot of activity going on like this is very deep a lot of activity
[3641.38s -> 3642.86s]  stimulation
[3642.86s -> 3646.60s]  It's kind of uh, it's kind of sick
[3647.20s -> 3652.64s]  but you get into the swing of it like I um last night I was like
[3653.36s -> 3658.96s]  Really just I hit like a weird flow state. Yeah, where my mind left my body and I just like
[3659.96s -> 3663.40s]  100% I think that's my favorite part of this game. It's like let's see hit that
[3663.96s -> 3666.40s]  Somebody just sniped me in the head. There's a sniper over there
[3667.32s -> 3672.63s]  So you can you can actually dodge their bullets because right before they fire you hear a sound
[3674.31s -> 3677.39s]  Your scope and then if you dodge left or right you won't get hit
[3683.47s -> 3686.35s]  Music sounds like rocks or the rock and roll clown. Oh
[3686.63s -> 3689.06s]  Oh
[3691.34s -> 3695.76s]  What is it I think that's my character I picked a voice that was really like
[3696.46s -> 3701.82s]  Oh, it's you. Okay over here. Oh, all right. Let's get out of maybe wait, maybe it's not me
[3702.14s -> 3705.66s]  No, you think the flame is my talks flamer
[3705.66s -> 3707.66s]  I
[3715.18s -> 3717.18s]  Might be the same actor
[3718.78s -> 3720.78s]  We need to Google this
[3720.86s -> 3724.70s]  In this universe, I don't want to I want to be more you're gonna use a skull. It'll fly off
[3730.54s -> 3732.54s]  I'm playing guys
[3737.50s -> 3739.06s]  You're so big
[3739.06s -> 3743.08s]  My hand is really sweaty
[3743.08s -> 3750.16s]  All right. Now you do unlock the store. So now we get some items
[3750.96s -> 3753.12s]  Yes, you can now purchase a weapon of choice
[3753.88s -> 3762.84s]  Perfect. This is a big decision. I got a hellbore Lays gun
[3768.32s -> 3774.59s]  2,500 bucks game looks cool game is cool. Actually
[3776.40s -> 3781.48s]  Actually, very cool. We got confirmation that it's not the voice of Rox. Oh, okay. Oh
[3781.84s -> 3785.24s]  I don't want to play this anymore
[3787.76s -> 3792.49s]  What do I go for this flashlight
[3792.49s -> 3798.64s]  We definitely need flashlights. Yeah, we all go go buy flashlights. So it's certain weapons have them the last gun
[3798.64s -> 3803.68s]  I think is the main one but there's also others that have it. So where's the story? We unlock it right now
[3803.68s -> 3805.68s]  All right, so follow me
[3807.40s -> 3811.20s]  Like it's just to the right over here I looked a super imposed
[3811.96s -> 3813.96s]  Yeah to the left. Sorry, not right
[3818.87s -> 3820.87s]  Which one?
[3824.12s -> 3827.16s]  Requisition weapons and curios. Oh god my damn headset
[3829.56s -> 3835.48s]  When you click the weapon look on the at the three icons and you'll see the one all the way on the right will look
[3835.48s -> 3837.48s]  like a flashlight
[3838.36s -> 3839.92s]  Well, this is my
[3839.92s -> 3843.44s]  Again, I want to just want to say thanks again to Warhammer for sponsoring the stream
[3844.20s -> 3847.60s]  Games really fun. That's obviously the first mission, but let's keep going
[3848.44s -> 3851.16s]  This is beta right now you can pre-order it right now the beta
[3852.17s -> 3857.15s]  Game launches on the 30th, but go on access to the beta. You can pre-order it right now
[3858.04s -> 3860.04s]  Game is pretty sick. I
[3860.64s -> 3863.99s]  Go I look at myself in the mirror for two hours every day
[3863.99s -> 3869.28s]  Oh, wow, how I warm up or should I get the axe instead check? I
[3870.71s -> 3874.49s]  Like your hair too. Thanks. Apparently I made
[3875.17s -> 3882.13s]  Hi Chachi, I gotta reckon with the armor out this way over here smell the revolver seems fun
[3887.78s -> 3890.72s]  You really do look like count Olaf
[3892.00s -> 3893.68s]  So embarrassing
[3893.68s -> 3902.07s]  What's the difference between these knives and sword for wards acts for single target? I like your tattoo. What's it mean?
[3902.91s -> 3910.64s]  Emperor these are these like not are these different rarities or something? Well, there's different rare numbers are level this like
[3912.28s -> 3920.72s]  Yeah, I get but you'll basically gonna level up every mission you do and so you'll be able to get new stuff in the shop
[3920.72s -> 3923.36s]  Every time what do I have? Yeah, what do I have right now?
[3923.48s -> 3934.15s]  All right, so damage is a little bit lower, but mobility is higher range is higher stopping powers higher reload speed is lower
[3934.15s -> 3944.58s]  I love this one. Oh, okay, tiny range tons more damage tons more real. Okay. I don't know get the shovel
[3944.58s -> 3950.00s]  Oh, wow. I don't look like I'm wearing pajamas anymore
[3950.12s -> 3954.94s]  Did you get pants are still my pants are still pajamas. Never mind a lot of crowd control
[3954.94s -> 3958.98s]  What does night get a knife? I want to cleave damage
[3959.18s -> 3964.74s]  What everyone has the most cleaved evan just one good bringing the thunder hammer
[3964.98s -> 3969.86s]  But if you want I would kind of recommend maybe a range weapon too, especially one with a flashlight
[3969.86s -> 3975.80s]  I don't think any of these have a flash. I do. I know I don't think Ogren gets flashlights. Unfortunately
[3979.71s -> 3984.96s]  All right, I'm going with super cleave damage I'm bringing a flashlight though, so we'll have some more
[3987.56s -> 3992.56s]  Do I look cool walking slow like this you look sick my friend?
[3995.08s -> 4000.61s]  You can inspect it too, are we doing the dark mission again right after this or are we doing something else?
[4000.61s -> 4005.87s]  I'm gonna do a dark mission. Let's do the dark mission. Yeah, okay. Let's do the one that power supply one
[4005.87s -> 4012.22s]  Well, it's gonna be really I think funny for your guys first experience in all these levels to be with no lights on
[4016.51s -> 4019.93s]  Nice. All right, cool. You have two options for dark missions
[4020.61s -> 4025.01s]  Yeah, let's do let's do the put the power supply one is the one that they just added right let's do that one
[4025.41s -> 4030.05s]  Yes, but we it's a power supply. It's the dark mission with two different main objectives
[4030.05s -> 4032.65s]  So two different levels that oh dark mission on it. So
[4034.53s -> 4039.54s]  either do one where we're going after assassinating a target or
[4040.26s -> 4042.82s]  We're trying to repair
[4043.22s -> 4049.90s]  Like a train assassinate. Let's do that way and do it. Let's do it on normal. Let's actually let's let's let's turn it up a little
[4049.98s -> 4056.08s]  Yeah, I don't difficultly too. Yeah, it'll be it'll be too difficult. Yeah. All right ready when you guys are I'm ready
[4058.78s -> 4060.46s]  I'm ready, too
[4060.46s -> 4066.94s]  So if you when you guys accept just double check that you you got the same the weapons you want
[4067.06s -> 4073.94s]  Yeah, open your inventory. Make sure it's in. Yeah, you got it. Yeah, so I'm doing a beer

[4081.79s -> 4084.79s]  Yeah, it looks like your head's on upside down kind of
[4085.33s -> 4087.33s]  I love your knife
[4088.41s -> 4093.09s]  Yeah, I know what you mean it's one of those like illusion photos and yeah
[4093.09s -> 4097.69s]  I bet if we flip that over if we got some Photoshop specialist to somehow flip that
[4100.13s -> 4107.57s]  Yeah, I bet the beer you just got Mandela affected yeah, I had like selective memory and removed his beard and Photoshop my eyes
[4110.93s -> 4112.93s]  Yeah, chat my pistol has a flashlight
[4113.37s -> 4119.21s]  That's good, so did we at least one or two of us have light right yeah, we'll be
[4119.93s -> 4125.93s]  Flashlight. Oh, yeah, that's been all my money on a flashlight. I'm just swinging a knife in the dark. Whatever

[4175.87s -> 4183.30s]  I'll be in the back charges in for
[4184.58s -> 4187.90s]  Well, I realized I don't have any weapons that can shoot more than 10 feet in front of it
[4187.90s -> 4191.18s]  It's like oh god, it's so creepy when they activate
[4196.89s -> 4205.84s]  This is so much scarier without being able to see
[4207.48s -> 4212.02s]  We can all take my guns with my gun if we need I
[4214.24s -> 4216.56s]  Keep forgetting that I'm one of the flashlight guys
[4217.24s -> 4219.96s]  It's like I switched to melee. I'm like why'd it get dark? Oh
[4221.68s -> 4226.35s]  There's a person. Oh
[4226.91s -> 4228.91s]  You're so quiet, too
[4228.95s -> 4234.44s]  What was that how?
[4234.48s -> 4236.48s]  Probably just a puppy
[4239.74s -> 4245.61s]  All right step
[4250.61s -> 4252.61s]  Watch out yo
[4253.49s -> 4256.29s]  Oh

[4269.97s -> 4272.34s]  Oh
[4273.77s -> 4275.77s]  My god, I'm dead
[4276.41s -> 4278.41s]  Shit. Oh my god. I'm down

[4304.70s -> 4308.15s]  Yeah
[4310.83s -> 4318.41s]  Did we slay the bomber or did the bomber explode on you we got him from a distance I think yeah, he's right here
[4319.03s -> 4322.60s]  This is a tiny skull. This is a child skull
[4325.52s -> 4328.28s]  You know what that checks out for the Warhammer universe, yeah
[4329.80s -> 4334.48s]  So dark good our dark dream is lagging a bit. No
[4338.00s -> 4340.00s]  That's a possibility
[4346.72s -> 4348.72s]  How did you get up here
[4351.04s -> 4354.90s]  You know, honestly, these are these are voice lines you say in the mirror
[4367.42s -> 4375.61s]  Weird guy over here. Yeah big guy. I definitely need something like that like I'm down
[4376.49s -> 4379.33s]  Wow, that's gonna be coming. That's gonna be using a lot
[4379.89s -> 4382.86s]  In your everyday life, there's that ammo. Yeah
[4383.50s -> 4386.78s]  Yeah, that that's got some. Oh my god sniper
[4387.66s -> 4389.66s]  Yeah, I can't snipe them anymore
[4390.66s -> 4395.28s]  How many of you guys walked around saying Thanos lines from Infinity War after Infinity War came up?
[4396.06s -> 4401.18s]  Come on a little bit not as much as the Joker when Dark Knight came out
[4402.50s -> 4404.58s]  Was that and more at we're just like
[4406.22s -> 4408.22s]  We were the annoying guys
[4408.86s -> 4414.20s]  But I did reduce to Adams was a bit of a favorite of mine
[4415.72s -> 4423.18s]  This is kind of scary. What's the sound? This is this is the talks person. It's the one that explodes and it gets too close
[4423.98s -> 4426.54s]  Keep an eye out. Oh
[4428.14s -> 4434.18s]  I don't know where he is. I don't see it. I'm quiet. Oh my god. I see the health station guys
[4434.18s -> 4436.18s]  I'm gonna make a run for it
[4436.94s -> 4438.94s]  Careful easy

[4446.98s -> 4449.26s]  explosive barrel if anyone needs it, there's there's a
[4450.02s -> 4452.02s]  little bit of ammo
[4456.16s -> 4462.14s]  Just like clunking him in the head. Oh
[4465.32s -> 4470.98s]  The melee is better for the armored guys know I'm trying to hit him directly in the face
[4471.10s -> 4475.90s]  If you have like an axe that's our piercing if you have like yeah, my axe is probably pretty good for that
[4476.70s -> 4479.00s]  So this healing station is should I take this?
[4479.62s -> 4485.06s]  Yeah, yeah for sure. This is you you'll recover that. Oh my god. It's him again. Oh god

[4917.00s -> 4919.00s]  We do reaction
[4921.06s -> 4925.66s]  What it's over that direction, I think it's it's the demonic hosts corruption
[4927.66s -> 4931.80s]  Don't go in there man, we can avoid it we can avoid it telling you don't go in there man
[4932.62s -> 4934.62s]  Oh fuck we can't avoid it. All right

[5018.11s -> 5023.63s]  Yeah, I see your skeleton right now. Yeah, I think it's the color of your heart is how much healthy you've got

[5198.52s -> 5206.60s]  It might just be the like the icy ground that activates it when you stand on top of it. That's true or attacking it. Yeah
[5207.20s -> 5209.60s]  That doesn't sound good
[5209.60s -> 5213.56s]  Yeah, either there's like there's something going on behind us. Oh, that's scary

[5285.06s -> 5289.50s]  Keep trying to jump on top of stuff and it vaults me over it. Somebody keeps throwing grenades at us
[5290.06s -> 5301.80s]  This place is giving me real creepy vibes everyone. I love how you said the barrel explodes and not even a second later it exploded

[5330.47s -> 5336.15s]  Really hope they're gonna add a tech freeze later the ones that like literally just pray to the machine spirit and they're like
[5336.71s -> 5338.71s]  my gun works because
[5339.71s -> 5341.71s]  I'm getting zapped by this thing

[5384.64s -> 5386.64s]  Yeah, you don't both you get like
[5386.96s -> 5390.12s]  if you think of every weapon you get is like a template and then
[5390.56s -> 5394.18s]  Create your own and try like reroll to get specific modifiers for it
[5394.64s -> 5402.03s]  That's okay. My knife has like bleed on hit and so I build this like if I hit a bleeding enemy
[5402.03s -> 5403.67s]  I get higher crit chance
[5403.67s -> 5406.79s]  So the stuff happens when I crit so then I just have like a crit
[5408.19s -> 5410.19s]  Well, what's that? Oh, dude
[5410.31s -> 5417.15s]  It's similar to vermin tide a bunch of lads over here

[5766.28s -> 5768.28s]  Reload the i'm gonna put healing down on the boss
[5769.16s -> 5774.24s]  I had a version of that halloween song for statin island. It went like this
[5775.04s -> 5778.40s]  This is parker said this is parker said parker said parker said
[5778.96s -> 5781.52s]  There was a bit of a parker set problem here like 10 years ago. So
[5782.00s -> 5784.64s]  Shields down. I thought it was being funny. It was mean
[5787.84s -> 5803.47s]  Oh fuck you want to go blow for blow, let's go everyone make a scream make a scream
[5809.95s -> 5813.97s]  Keep keep killing them everybody do a voice line from your character
[5820.03s -> 5822.03s]  We did it good job everyone
[5824.12s -> 5828.12s]  Thank you. Was that good enough? Oh, that was good. All right, good. Let's wrap up
[5830.83s -> 5833.07s]  Oh my god, that guy turned into just gibs
[5835.90s -> 5837.58s]  Grub hubba salami
[5837.58s -> 5840.32s]  on me
[5840.32s -> 5842.32s]  That was cool. That was fun
[5844.68s -> 5849.36s]  That was you just got possessed
[5849.36s -> 5851.36s]  That looks so good do higher difficulty
[5852.16s -> 5855.76s]  Well, we we need to get our our levels up a little and unlock a few weapons
[5856.40s -> 5860.64s]  I wouldn't try it the next difficulty until like at least level five. Yeah
[5862.41s -> 5864.89s]  I got a level five unlock like skills and stuff
[5865.87s -> 5867.87s]  All right, that thing looks pretty amazing
[5871.13s -> 5873.69s]  The calm chatter doesn't meet e3 quality standards
[5875.24s -> 5882.04s]  Oh, we can do an e3 freaking calm chatter. We could easily now. We absolutely could for sure. We're all very very familiar
[5885.93s -> 5889.47s]  Copernicus i've got a tango on my six. I'm gonna go look at this new weapon
[5890.96s -> 5894.72s]  And i'm also gonna make sure to tell you guys that again warhammer sponsored this stream
[5895.60s -> 5896.72s]  uh
[5896.72s -> 5898.72s]  Games actually really goddamn fun
[5899.20s -> 5904.78s]  Um, it's available if you pre-order it, uh, this is the beta the game comes out on the 30th
[5906.67s -> 5911.13s]  Four player co-op played vermintide. It's it's kind of in that same world
[5912.06s -> 5919.71s]  Also warhammer and let's keep going. It's been pretty fun so far
[5921.08s -> 5925.24s]  Pants are like this gold standard of like this game's economy
[5926.04s -> 5928.04s]  All right, I want to see that gun
[5930.04s -> 5932.28s]  Oh my god, you're you're right. They're so expensive
[5933.08s -> 5935.64s]  I want to look at that thing
[5938.14s -> 5943.71s]  If yeah 15 000, i'm gonna look like a dweeb forever. Yeah 20 000
[5945.02s -> 5947.45s]  Wait, where did you buy your shirt from?
[5947.45s -> 5953.58s]  It was just in the character creator. Well, you can change your shirt in the character creator
[5953.58s -> 5958.06s]  Yeah, also the character creator has a bunch of personality questions that I was not prepared for
[5959.58s -> 5963.98s]  I can't I don't think it does that matter. Does that add anything to your character? Uh, it's your voice
[5964.46s -> 5966.14s]  uh lines
[5966.14s -> 5967.02s]  Really?
[5969.24s -> 5975.34s]  That that's actually pretty cool because honestly it's like a 10 question survey that you take when you make your character
[5975.58s -> 5984.46s]  I definitely needed a gun
[5984.46s -> 5986.62s]  How often should you uh buy better?
[5987.71s -> 5990.27s]  guns and all that
[5990.27s -> 5991.23s]  um
[5991.23s -> 5994.62s]  I'd say like every other level
[5994.70s -> 5998.54s]  At this point is probably good good or if you literally just want to try a new type of weapon
[5998.62s -> 6001.42s]  I'd say like just buy buy it. It's never a bad idea
[6002.70s -> 6011.40s]  Yeah, I have a nice variety now. I'm pretty happy with that because eventually you're gonna start buying them to craft them into better gear
[6011.88s -> 6013.58s]  Will you break them down?
[6013.58s -> 6019.98s]  Yes, you can you can break them down to get money or you can use them as raw materials to craft a better
[6020.54s -> 6022.54s]  Version of whatever that weapon is
[6023.26s -> 6025.50s]  I have like three different knives because knives are my favorite
[6025.50s -> 6030.70s]  So I was like i'll buy a bunch so that I have options when i'm upgrading them. How do you?
[6031.18s -> 6033.02s]  How do you break the old one down?
[6033.02s -> 6037.50s]  If you go into your inventory and then click on it and then hold x it'll discard
[6040.62s -> 6043.02s]  I should yeah, this is the slowest reload ever
[6043.90s -> 6048.46s]  Oh, that's how you get a gun actually shoots through look at that. It actually hits more than one target
[6049.64s -> 6052.32s]  Cool
[6052.32s -> 6055.28s]  Go to the training area. Oh, that's where you guys are, right? Right? Where are you?
[6056.08s -> 6061.15s]  Yeah, i'm in the training area
[6061.15s -> 6064.99s]  Where is that at compared to the little the walt disneyland place?
[6065.87s -> 6067.61s]  um
[6067.61s -> 6069.61s]  Oh god, I don't even know how to explain it
[6070.01s -> 6075.13s]  I've got a good imagination. I'll probably just imagine how my gun would shoot shrine of the
[6075.37s -> 6077.37s]  Om nissiah, what is this?
[6078.17s -> 6080.59s]  need to be level four
[6080.59s -> 6082.67s]  His dude's name is how do I play this game?
[6083.39s -> 6091.20s]  He's level 10. He seems to have a pretty good grasp trust him. Yes. Trust that chat member that viewer that uh player. Oh my god
[6092.24s -> 6100.59s]  I'm fine. It's the mini stroke. It's an upgrade station. Oh, that's when you get to do that. All right, so right here
[6104.81s -> 6108.43s]  Yeah, this revolver is fucking awesome r1 r1 r1 r1 r1 r1
[6115.18s -> 6117.18s]  I can do like one more
[6117.34s -> 6121.34s]  If you guys are okay with one more. Oh, yeah, i'm i'm i'm gonna play this for at least the next hour
[6121.98s -> 6127.44s]  Yeah, okay, because I I have a I have an engagement. I must go to congratulations
[6128.46s -> 6130.46s]  No, no, it's just a
[6130.94s -> 6132.62s]  It's a friends giving
[6132.62s -> 6137.50s]  Um, oh cool. Also, there's my my other friends are doing a charity stream today. So i'm gonna be
[6138.14s -> 6141.82s]  Throwing them the host after this but oh, yeah, very cool. Yeah. Oh, yeah
[6145.10s -> 6147.50s]  Only an hour. No, i'm i'm i'm down to play
[6149.29s -> 6154.48s]  Um, you guys okay finding a replacement after I leave we can also just maybe do randoms
[6154.56s -> 6161.05s]  It doesn't really matter right? No, probably not. Yeah, I got some people that are down to play I think
[6161.45s -> 6164.09s]  Yeah, everyone to just come on in that's easy
[6164.81s -> 6170.78s]  Should I get
[6170.78s -> 6172.78s]  What's uh, what's the mission that we should do?
[6173.64s -> 6176.68s]  Uh, I can do you want to keep doing dark ones or do you want to do one?
[6177.40s -> 6181.08s]  That let's do let's do a normal. Let's do a normal one. Yeah, I want to see for a little bit
[6181.98s -> 6188.78s]  Yeah, uh chat member I meant raid I forgot the um, I say host still because i've been saying it for like years
[6189.02s -> 6194.14s]  But uh, yeah, they got rid of that feature. So i'll raid let's start gone. Is there another one with the boss? The bosses are fun
[6194.70s -> 6203.82s]  There's there's weird. What's that weird slug thing? Criken, you know that that like slug boss that showed the beast of miracle
[6204.22s -> 6207.50s]  Yeah, I love that thing. So the lore of that thing is he uh,
[6208.06s -> 6213.42s]  He just wants a hug like he's just friendly and like wants that like, you know, like a golden retriever, you know
[6213.50s -> 6215.74s]  Like he just wants to hug you i'll give him a hug
[6216.14s -> 6222.22s]  But he's incredibly poisonous and also eats you accent something else that i'm realizing right now, too
[6222.38s -> 6225.26s]  Which is interesting. So these missions up here
[6225.74s -> 6229.82s]  They reset or refresh every 10 to 15 minutes or something. Yeah
[6230.44s -> 6233.16s]  Interesting, so you'll always have new things
[6233.72s -> 6236.14s]  Huh?
[6236.14s -> 6243.37s]  Oh one just it's literally just happened. I saw that. Yeah. Yeah, it just happened. What so we could do
[6244.68s -> 6248.14s]  Uh, I don't think we've done this mission yet. What's the what's a raid?
[6250.19s -> 6256.83s]  That's a difficulty one, but that one's a fun level. So unfortunately, I don't have it on two right now, but okay
[6257.39s -> 6260.19s]  Let's do another one place in like a pleasant location
[6261.21s -> 6263.21s]  Not really pleasant
[6265.50s -> 6267.58s]  One takes place in a chuck-e-cheese ball pit
[6268.54s -> 6272.94s]  This is a huge ball pit. It's the whole level which is to say that it's a pit of disease
[6272.94s -> 6278.40s]  Which is what this game is about. I was about to say make sure you uh equip your weapons. Thanks
[6278.64s -> 6287.16s]  Yeah, I got my revolver somebody said why am I playing as the amish hulk?
[6291.37s -> 6297.07s]  I love you. I love every weapon. I've seen you have I love it. Look at this big giant knife
[6299.82s -> 6305.18s]  Yeah, it's like it's like the hulk's brother, right? They like they went like separate ways in life. Yeah the hulk
[6309.68s -> 6311.28s]  And they have to go
[6311.28s -> 6314.24s]  They have to go convince the amish hulk to like come on man. We need you
[6315.74s -> 6320.06s]  And he's like he's like putting a wheelbarrow with butter in it. He doesn't want anything to do with it
[6320.62s -> 6323.58s]  He refuses to ride the train to get out of retirement
[6324.78s -> 6327.40s]  He walks there
[6327.40s -> 6331.60s]  We need you amish hulk credible hulk
[6334.27s -> 6336.11s]  The credible hulk
[6336.11s -> 6340.99s]  I just borrowed that from a chat member. Um, apparently the hulk are a real thing in 40k
[6341.07s -> 6346.51s]  So I accidentally what chat when you have lore the size of 45 bibles
[6347.55s -> 6352.59s]  There's going to be something for anything. You just save something and you know, what is this? It's probably true
[6352.99s -> 6355.87s]  Everything's make-believe words guys. Oh I can stab
[6357.96s -> 6359.96s]  The blimpticus are real
[6362.04s -> 6368.04s]  I'm so glad I can see
[6369.88s -> 6371.88s]  My god this environment
[6373.00s -> 6374.68s]  Although those people
[6374.68s -> 6379.48s]  What was oh those are on our side. They're like the ones sending us in or basically the suicide squad, right? So
[6380.12s -> 6382.12s]  They're like, oh, okay
[6382.52s -> 6385.40s]  That's right. Yeah, because you yeah, I know the prologue, right?
[6390.16s -> 6395.36s]  And you can appreciate the level with all the lights in it, I guess I can hit fire
[6395.36s -> 6397.37s]  I don't have to just stabilize it
[6397.37s -> 6400.89s]  It's nice that I can like switch to a weapon that doesn't have a flashlight now
[6401.85s -> 6404.25s]  This thing is so much better than the thing. I just was using
[6405.21s -> 6407.21s]  By a long shot
[6407.37s -> 6411.37s]  No, is that the three round burst one? It is. Yep. Yeah, I like that one
[6413.79s -> 6415.79s]  Maybe i'm just not using the other one correctly
[6417.04s -> 6421.71s]  Actually shouldn't even be using it right now
[6422.11s -> 6436.06s]  Oh, your voice is terrifying. I love it. I need I need a little help guys. What's up, buddy?
[6436.78s -> 6438.46s]  um
[6438.46s -> 6444.14s]  There's just some dudes that were just I I don't know one guy this guy giving me trouble they hurt
[6446.30s -> 6448.30s]  All right, i'm good now, thank you
[6450.67s -> 6452.99s]  You need to block and shove occasionally. Yeah
[6457.00s -> 6459.08s]  I don't block and shove and i'm doing just fine
[6463.08s -> 6466.81s]  This thing is sec
[6466.81s -> 6469.61s]  Oh criken, do you like um, do you like city builders?
[6470.81s -> 6472.81s]  city builder
[6472.81s -> 6476.89s]  I don't know builder d's nuts like any city builder type game. Oh my god. He got me you're right
[6479.44s -> 6483.36s]  Uh, oh you mean like um, just the genre of games in general. Yeah that genre
[6484.08s -> 6486.88s]  Uh, yeah, I I played uh, let's go
[6488.24s -> 6489.20s]  Okay
[6489.20s -> 6492.72s]  I don't know if I got a game. I got a game recommend my channel. Oh god. Here we go
[6493.44s -> 6497.52s]  Well, I got a good game recommendation. It's a city building rogue light that I think you might like
[6498.08s -> 6503.52s]  Shit, they're too fast city building rogue light. Yeah, it's really cool. It's my favorite game of the year so far
[6503.52s -> 6505.04s]  Aside from elden ring
[6505.04s -> 6506.32s]  Really?
[6506.32s -> 6507.80s]  Yeah
[6507.80s -> 6509.32s]  What is it called?
[6509.32s -> 6511.24s]  Um, I don't want to seem like a shill
[6512.36s -> 6514.36s]  I'm not a shill
[6515.24s -> 6520.68s]  I got a movie recommendation for you, but i'm not gonna tell you I can't tell you my chat will get angry. It's so awesome
[6524.11s -> 6528.67s]  No, it's called against the storm. I love it. I've been playing like every day. It's really good. Nice
[6529.71s -> 6534.11s]  Yeah, i'll uh, I just want to see more people succumb to the addiction of that game
[6534.83s -> 6539.63s]  I think there's so many games that not recently i'm like struggling to keep up i've been playing this so much
[6540.67s -> 6543.47s]  It's like the first hour and a half of a sim city game
[6544.11s -> 6547.95s]  And then you just keep doing that and it gets more complex and it's wonderful. I love it
[6551.23s -> 6554.91s]  Uh, can you guys do my favorite talk about this game? Oh, yeah
[6558.43s -> 6560.43s]  Um, excuse me about this one
[6561.15s -> 6563.58s]  Man
[6566.70s -> 6571.02s]  It's funny because you really have you've been like you've been playing this a lot, you know everything
[6572.35s -> 6574.59s]  Look, this servitor was turned into a typewriter
[6576.30s -> 6578.30s]  Yes, yes
[6579.34s -> 6584.30s]  Hey, don't shoot that. This is my new favorite. I like this game because in it you get to shoot
[6584.86s -> 6586.30s]  That's true
[6586.30s -> 6590.16s]  I like this game because it seems like hold on a minute. We've got an issue
[6592.84s -> 6594.60s]  Handle this
[6594.60s -> 6598.20s]  Our servitors by choice, uh turn into typewriters. No
[6598.92s -> 6600.04s]  Okay
[6600.04s -> 6602.36s]  It's usually if you've done a crime like stealing apple
[6603.40s -> 6606.41s]  or
[6606.41s -> 6608.41s]  You know
[6608.41s -> 6610.41s]  Bump into the wrong person
[6610.73s -> 6612.73s]  Oh my god
[6613.45s -> 6616.57s]  So in the warhammer universe like every minor thing
[6617.69s -> 6624.65s]  Like not like overly minor crimes, but you can get turned into a typewriter. Yes, that's so ridiculous
[6625.53s -> 6626.89s]  like the
[6626.89s -> 6629.21s]  You know, like when you're doing that personality quiz to fill out for your character
[6629.29s -> 6633.69s]  Those were like how you ended up in this situation, right? That's no one for mine was like
[6634.97s -> 6635.77s]  I
[6635.77s -> 6643.13s]  Complained about the taste of corpse starch, which is what everyone's given to eat is literally like melted down people
[6643.85s -> 6647.37s]  And I was like the corpse starch is kind of bad today and someone overheard me
[6648.89s -> 6651.13s]  And then you got arrested. Yeah, that's how I run my
[6651.61s -> 6657.53s]  Colonies people just throw a fit about their bedroom and I just don't like give them peg legs
[6658.97s -> 6661.53s]  Yeah, and uh, not to talk about another game for too long
[6661.61s -> 6664.17s]  but in rimworld my chat kept wanting me to get the the
[6664.81s -> 6666.97s]  The one where you could make people into like
[6667.67s -> 6670.33s]  Milkable like colonists mod. Did you ever use that mod?
[6670.89s -> 6674.09s]  Uh warhammers takes place actually guys
[6674.81s -> 6675.83s]  in
[6675.83s -> 6679.61s]  4100 millennia the textures are great in this area and
[6680.09s -> 6685.37s]  The boss we're about to fight here is who is it again? I would probably just do I don't know but is he milkable?
[6687.31s -> 6690.35s]  Probably um, hey snot you might want this
[6691.71s -> 6695.71s]  Yeah, I just feel bad the server the server doesn't want to be here
[6695.87s -> 6700.99s]  So if we complete the level finding all these scriptures, then they get bonus exp and money
[6701.39s -> 6703.71s]  There's a lot of people over there and i'm in trouble
[6704.51s -> 6706.64s]  Can I use this? What?
[6706.64s -> 6709.32s]  It's like three stop shooting our hulk
[6710.96s -> 6712.96s]  Can't count the on three though, I guess that's
[6714.00s -> 6723.00s]  Makes sense
[6723.00s -> 6727.85s]  This thing is so fun
[6727.85s -> 6732.73s]  Can I press it? Oh, wait, I don't think I should have pressed it that
[6733.29s -> 6734.89s]  Prested that
[6734.89s -> 6739.37s]  I'll press the button. Why I should have should have pressed it that why am I turning english?
[6740.09s -> 6742.09s]  No, you're role playing you're fine
[6744.16s -> 6746.59s]  That's the credible hurt
[6753.85s -> 6756.01s]  I know i'm the same boat as you
[6757.13s -> 6759.85s]  Who's gonna get it first you can have it. No, you can have it
[6761.69s -> 6763.69s]  You know, do you take it take it
[6764.59s -> 6765.87s]  Okay, fine
[6765.87s -> 6766.83s]  Yep
[6766.83s -> 6770.19s]  Yeah, I guess I think you you need it more than I do because you have more suppressing fire than I do

[7765.28s -> 7769.76s]  Now is the sun the center of the no because they're they're like a galactic civilization
[7769.84s -> 7773.84s]  The emperor is the center the moon's center of the universe. Good answer. Good answer. Good answer

[7810.19s -> 7814.35s]  I got the cysts. Oh
[7814.51s -> 7824.94s]  Oh
[7832.96s -> 7835.36s]  Oh, sorry, we'll be there in a second. I was just killing some cysts
[7837.71s -> 7839.71s]  Um that scripture dropped
[7840.51s -> 7842.51s]  Yeah, I want to go back and grab it
[7842.75s -> 7844.75s]  Does this heal? Oh, it is healing who did this?
[7845.47s -> 7847.28s]  We did this

[7851.74s -> 7853.74s]  Oh, we stopped doing that bit
[7854.90s -> 7857.62s]  Um, yeah, where'd the scripture go smelting?
[7860.22s -> 7864.66s]  Yeah, where is it? I don't see it. I grabbed the scripture. Oh, I grabbed it. I grabbed it
[7865.46s -> 7868.30s]  Oh, okay. I see
[7868.30s -> 7870.46s]  I can't wait to get out of here and read this book guys
[7871.18s -> 7874.35s]  Yeah
[7874.35s -> 7876.24s]  Whoa
[7876.24s -> 7878.24s]  Gotta push your way to the other side

[7924.88s -> 7926.32s]  Wait, it might heal you
[7926.32s -> 7929.52s]  I almost did for the bit then I realized I had a scripture. I'm not doing that
[7930.40s -> 7935.84s]  Thank you
[7935.84s -> 7937.84s]  There's a lot of people right now
[7937.84s -> 7947.17s]  I need a sword for better crowd control. I want like a big axe
[7948.51s -> 7956.43s]  The axe is really good for like, um bosses and like powerful targets, but there are weapons that are more designed for like crowds
[7957.23s -> 7958.67s]  Yeah
[7958.67s -> 7960.67s]  nice
[7961.55s -> 7964.11s]  Nice, how many books what's our book status?
[7965.95s -> 7969.47s]  Does it show how many kills you had because I definitely was number one and I want to prove it and see it
[7970.59s -> 7972.59s]  I don't think they've added that yet, but apparently it's on the way
[7973.23s -> 7975.23s]  Oh dang. Yeah, I was probably up there
[7976.19s -> 7982.11s]  Too bad we can't find out i'm just kidding forgetting. I used my ability one time that entire match
[7982.99s -> 7984.03s]  Really?
[7984.03s -> 7985.71s]  Yeah, I need to I
[7985.71s -> 7987.39s]  I just keep forgetting
[7987.39s -> 7994.56s]  Oh, it does show kills now. It does total for everyone. I think yeah. Oh cool. We had exactly 100 a thousand exactly 1000
[7995.04s -> 7998.56s]  Oh, wait. No, it was a thousand. I missed a zero. That's pretty rare
[7999.28s -> 8002.96s]  It's got to be rare
[8002.96s -> 8004.96s]  That's got to be rare. That's a good omen
[8006.02s -> 8007.70s]  Oh my god, I have a grenade
[8007.70s -> 8009.26s]  gauntlet
[8009.26s -> 8011.26s]  Oh, yeah, those are fun
[8011.42s -> 8015.09s]  That sounds fun
[8015.09s -> 8018.69s]  Ah, sweet. Just got some fresh loot my drops aren't loading. Um
[8019.81s -> 8022.85s]  Uh, maybe refresh maybe you have to reconnect your uh account or something
[8023.57s -> 8027.97s]  This should be on can we confirm that the drops actually have been on and working they're working. Okay
[8028.85s -> 8036.66s]  Yeah, mine was only working on mine. Cool. I really I would like to get your drops as well. I got two drops
[8037.63s -> 8049.23s]  Cool. Oh, I have a cutscene. We're back. Ooh, I don't have a cutscene
[8049.23s -> 8053.07s]  But i'll be right back in one minute
[8053.55s -> 8055.39s]  Yeah, so this is um
[8055.39s -> 8060.11s]  This is fun. I like it
[8060.35s -> 8062.35s]  I have a cutscene, too
[8069.70s -> 8071.70s]  I already saw this one
[8071.70s -> 8075.62s]  Executed for less this unit will request permission to do so
[8077.06s -> 8082.93s]  The recruit is expected to achieve competence in regard to technical apparatus
[8084.27s -> 8086.27s]  I'm curious about this
[8090.03s -> 8094.03s]  In order to perform their duties at the maximum level of efficiency
[8094.51s -> 8100.66s]  Because I think i'm level four, right?
[8101.22s -> 8103.46s]  Will most likely cause the recruit to die
[8104.91s -> 8106.35s]  Do check your pizza
[8106.35s -> 8115.66s]  It's all right
[8115.66s -> 8118.54s]  All right. You've started to make a name for yourself reach trust level eight
[8119.10s -> 8121.71s]  You've unlocked the shrine of okay, so there's the shrine
[8122.51s -> 8124.75s]  Actually, let me come back and say
[8125.98s -> 8130.46s]  20 of 163 on the oh god. That's a that's a very small amount. So idea
[8130.46s -> 8133.42s]  I just unlocked the ability to upgrade or do whatever this is
[8134.72s -> 8136.72s]  the shrine
[8137.60s -> 8141.68s]  Oh, I have this too, I don't maybe I don't want any of these i'm just gonna
[8143.15s -> 8147.07s]  You know, i'll just wait. I'll earn more money and i'll buy a different weapon when they refresh
[8148.43s -> 8150.43s]  Oh, because wait, what's consequent?
[8151.17s -> 8153.57s]  So it basically with this thing. It's like once you find a weapon you like
[8154.21s -> 8156.61s]  Uh, you can theoretically just keep upgrading it
[8157.41s -> 8159.73s]  Oh and it uses this, uh this currency
[8161.41s -> 8166.24s]  Where's that person? It's over. It's kind of right out the
[8166.64s -> 8168.16s]  See if we can find you
[8168.16s -> 8171.36s]  It's literally if you go to the big, um green room
[8172.32s -> 8177.20s]  And just if it is a hallway you just turn. Um, it's like it's literally like two feet away
[8177.84s -> 8181.52s]  Oh here. Okay. I see. It's like a robot this five or six slots. Yep
[8182.24s -> 8190.61s]  I don't think I want to do anything
[8190.61s -> 8194.77s]  Yeah, i'm worried to lock into something and start upgrading if I find something better. Yeah
[8195.81s -> 8200.37s]  You unfortunately kind of just have to level a bunch to get more options before you start spending the resources. So
[8201.09s -> 8205.49s]  I imagine you probably just get resources and it's not too terrible, right?
[8206.13s -> 8212.29s]  Yeah, they probably only added resources like a few days ago. Oh, wow. Okay. Yeah, that's still like that whole grind is new
[8212.61s -> 8213.97s]  What is this?
[8213.97s -> 8216.05s]  New perk i'll get i'll upgrade this
[8216.93s -> 8219.27s]  But if you guys want to learn how to get new cosmetics
[8219.97s -> 8222.72s]  I can explain that real quick
[8223.36s -> 8226.40s]  How do you inching ever so close to buying that grenade?
[8226.48s -> 8232.94s]  How may I serve plus five percent you want to buy the pants you can also earn them by doing achievements, um
[8233.74s -> 8239.02s]  And every class has their own achievements. So if you go to penances, yeah penances press escape go to penances
[8239.66s -> 8242.30s]  Uh class and then pick your class
[8242.94s -> 8247.74s]  And it'll give like a little description. So for me, it was like while dashing kill a mutant with a melee attack
[8247.82s -> 8249.82s]  And I got a shirt for that
[8250.51s -> 8252.91s]  Oh, I just unlocked a weapon, but I don't see it here
[8253.87s -> 8258.43s]  Kill three enemies with a frag grenade without it bouncing interesting and you unlock shirt for that
[8260.32s -> 8261.36s]  Yeah
[8261.36s -> 8262.93s]  I see
[8262.93s -> 8267.97s]  During a single use of volley fire hit the weak spot of four enemies with a weapon secondary action without missing a shot
[8269.73s -> 8272.93s]  Damn, oh some of these are gonna take me a while. Wait
[8276.13s -> 8278.13s]  It's I unlocked a weapon but
[8278.93s -> 8280.93s]  I don't have it and it's not at the store
[8281.41s -> 8283.41s]  So you unlocked a weapon class?
[8284.05s -> 8286.69s]  Oh, it's just meaning you can now buy it
[8287.33s -> 8291.97s]  But it won't be in the store all the time. I think because the weapons refresh. Oh, okay
[8292.61s -> 8296.69s]  But I think germa at level four or five. I think four you get a free weapon
[8297.78s -> 8303.54s]  Also, the shop refreshes in one minute. So if it's not in there now, it might be in one minute
[8304.18s -> 8306.02s]  Your pizza is ready
[8306.02s -> 8312.05s]  I'll go get it. Oh, hold on. I don't know if this pizza is real. Yeah, I just yeah
[8312.93s -> 8317.60s]  Yeah, I don't know either. Let me see it real quick
[8318.62s -> 8320.62s]  It's gonna eat the little bits real quick
[8322.56s -> 8325.23s]  Oh god
[8325.23s -> 8328.67s]  He did it. Oh hot fuck. He did it off camera
[8331.70s -> 8336.13s]  German scared of his own oven, huh? How was the za?
[8337.34s -> 8341.18s]  Um, it's frozen on the bottom and the top was burning hot that I've managed
[8343.87s -> 8347.39s]  I don't know. I have this little oven over here. It's only heats from the top and I don't know
[8347.39s -> 8354.02s]  I just put it in there. It's like an easy big oven. Vinny if you get the right components you can build
[8354.66s -> 8355.68s]  the
[8355.68s -> 8357.76s]  chevalma
[8357.76s -> 8359.76s]  Why do I think that's something like ligma?
[8361.82s -> 8367.04s]  Like are you tricking me into saying something chat member? Okay, so the weapon should probably be refreshed, right?
[8368.24s -> 8370.16s]  Oh 25 seconds
[8370.16s -> 8372.00s]  Make your final purchases
[8372.00s -> 8376.91s]  Ding ding ding if you see a rare in there, should you just get it or no there's gonna
[8377.71s -> 8384.37s]  It eventually becomes much higher chance for rares and purples and stuff. So so there are they like legendaries? Yeah, there's legendaries
[8385.33s -> 8388.85s]  Now you just haven't yet. You just started speaking my language here. Oh, yeah
[8389.65s -> 8392.37s]  Where are the new weapons gonna be? Oh what I see I see
[8394.24s -> 8396.24s]  one second
[8396.40s -> 8398.40s]  zero seconds
[8398.40s -> 8401.60s]  Oh new weapons different. Okay. Ooh
[8402.48s -> 8410.68s]  What does it mean that if it's on the black market? I don't know which one
[8411.83s -> 8415.19s]  ranged weak spot or ranged probably this one although the
[8415.91s -> 8417.44s]  ammo is
[8417.44s -> 8422.31s]  Terrible for this one. What do you guys think?
[8426.66s -> 8429.94s]  What I think wait, are these gonna be different for all of us? Yeah
[8431.11s -> 8432.31s]  Hey
[8432.31s -> 8436.21s]  chat
[8438.16s -> 8442.56s]  Autoguns are a trap really besides the brace braced autogun. Oh, okay
[8443.20s -> 8447.24s]  So maybe wait a little longer
[8449.94s -> 8451.46s]  I'm gonna save my money
[8451.46s -> 8454.58s]  Should I get a new flamer?
[8454.58s -> 8468.58s]  Or hammer? Oh shit. Oh wait, it's like a punch gauntlet like an explosive gauntlet or something. Very cool
[8468.98s -> 8475.16s]  How you guys doing you uh, you still around for another one video are you gonna take off? No, I I'm I gotta take off
[8475.16s -> 8477.16s]  I'm sorry. No, it's all good

[8499.01s -> 8503.65s]  You got man, all right. Bye have fun. Bye guys
[8505.17s -> 8509.81s]  Uh, so do we have another fourth or are we gonna just do matchmaking or uh, I can pick some people
[8509.97s -> 8514.96s]  We can also uh, we might have I think I criken are these staffs cool?
[8516.47s -> 8519.51s]  Uh, yeah, they're like four staff. It sounds badass
[8519.99s -> 8525.91s]  I think they're like you can channel like a lightning or fire. I haven't tried it myself yet, but they look fun
[8526.15s -> 8530.64s]  Uh, how do I invite somebody? Can I just do it just from what you have to be later? Yeah
[8531.84s -> 8535.08s]  Anyone can invite within the group. Okay, cool, because I think
[8536.04s -> 8541.12s]  Uh, I think I got a yeah, I got I got one of my mods. The vr. Josh is done
[8546.95s -> 8556.10s]  So just go I can just invite him from here. Okay, so
[8557.52s -> 8559.92s]  um
[8559.92s -> 8571.59s]  Invite I think I just did it. All right, it'd be here in a second. Let me um, actually drag him into this call
[8582.56s -> 8591.16s]  There we go. Where did you save the little place to test the weapon is?
[8592.08s -> 8595.44s]  Yo, uh the meat grinder. What's up? What's up? Hello. Hello
[8596.16s -> 8602.96s]  Yeah, this is uh vr. Josh. Hello vr. Josh. Hello. I think i've met cracking before yeah in vr. Yeah
[8603.68s -> 8609.75s]  Yeah, I know vr. Josh. Did you get the invite? Josh? Yeah, I just uh got to get the game
[8610.39s -> 8614.79s]  Sweet i've already done the tutorial and everything. So oh so you're you're a seasoned player. I think then right?
[8614.95s -> 8619.11s]  Well, I mean I got the first tutorial round and then the first match they throw you into but yeah
[8619.83s -> 8623.66s]  Okay, cool. This is you i'm assuming right this uh virtuous
[8624.36s -> 8630.52s]  Yeah, okay. All right. So what mission should we do?
[8631.60s -> 8633.01s]  Well
[8633.01s -> 8637.65s]  I'd say once you guys get level five then we could start a or a tier three mission
[8637.97s -> 8642.47s]  It will be difficult at five, but if it's doable people are saying that
[8643.33s -> 8645.99s]  Mod busy we can do whatever we want
[8647.25s -> 8652.13s]  Uh, this is not just that's not how it works. There's not just one mod here
[8652.29s -> 8670.77s]  I can't find this training arena. Is there a refresher? Is it? Oh, okay. Prepare repair
[8672.71s -> 8676.23s]  Assassination was kind of cool. Yeah
[8676.39s -> 8685.80s]  Uh, we got depends if you want one with lights on or lights off. Um, I think lights on I don't think we're uh,
[8686.04s -> 8688.60s]  skilled enough as new players to handle the
[8689.44s -> 8693.12s]  Yeah, it also sucks because you can't use the like you can't use other weapons
[8693.76s -> 8697.28s]  Like just having to use the one gun with the flashlight. Yeah, I will say though
[8699.43s -> 8704.31s]  That is actually really cool mechanic to put in the game because they can just keep doing weird shit like that
[8704.63s -> 8710.08s]  Like oh today, um, uh grenades just uh fall from the sky every five seconds
[8710.48s -> 8716.85s]  Like they can do cool wacky shit like that. I think that's pretty cool because you said those missions are playable just normally, right?
[8718.26s -> 8719.06s]  Uh, yeah
[8719.06s -> 8727.16s]  No, I think there's definitely the potential for like a whole bunch of modifiers later on that's cool. Oh
[8727.72s -> 8732.13s]  Wait, oh wait, I didn't do I put my weapon on no you're in here. Oh, they're on here
[8732.37s -> 8736.47s]  Oh, yeah looks like it you can also put your weapon on if you press i and then you can equip it
[8736.47s -> 8739.54s]  Oh my god. I look so cool
[8739.62s -> 8741.62s]  If you don't look any different
[8742.87s -> 8747.91s]  What wait, where's my sword or my oh my god wait till we get in there guys you I if you didn't have a crush on
[8747.91s -> 8754.68s]  Me before you might just have one boy. I as soon as we get in there. I look so cool
[8754.76s -> 8757.40s]  And it's just like you have the same shirt and pants on you just have like a
[8758.04s -> 8765.36s]  A different weapon here. You'll see when we get in game. You'll see rest assured god
[8765.36s -> 8772.45s]  I can't wait to get some better clothing options though. I look kind of dweebish. Yeah cracking it. Did you buy that costume?
[8773.14s -> 8778.68s]  No, I did the achievements for it, which is like just doing special, you know challenges in the level
[8784.02s -> 8786.02s]  Are you learning to count
[8786.42s -> 8790.18s]  Learning to count by his fingers the servitors just like insulting the ogre
[8791.38s -> 8792.34s]  Yeah
[8792.34s -> 8796.34s]  So apparently in lore the smartest ogren can count to four
[8796.90s -> 8798.10s]  That's
[8798.10s -> 8801.94s]  That's really that's literally the smartest ogren out there can get to four

[8843.27s -> 8846.82s]  Look up
[8846.82s -> 8848.82s]  We're inside of a motherboard
[8849.96s -> 8851.24s]  I've said yeah
[8851.24s -> 8853.16s]  Yeah, so this is what the rat in my pc
[8853.24s -> 8858.60s]  They basically build cities on top of cities in this universe because there's just too many people and over time it expands too much
[8859.08s -> 8861.40s]  So that's just like another city up there
[8862.20s -> 8866.04s]  It's upside down or something. It is it feels like it's upside down. Yeah
[8866.68s -> 8868.68s]  Mirrored or something. That's weird
[8868.84s -> 8872.20s]  I would hate to live here, dude. I would get so bullied
[8873.00s -> 8876.44s]  This would be tough. I would get so bullied
[8878.44s -> 8884.87s]  I mean you you fucking go into school with your like staff and pajamas
[8888.20s -> 8891.08s]  I got my stupid little onesie on my my yellow onesie
[8891.24s -> 8894.92s]  Me
[8894.92s -> 8898.52s]  Yeah, I would yeah, they would instantly turn me into one of those servitor toilets
[8899.40s -> 8905.59s]  This thing is so cool. All right, and also it's also it's a melee weapon
[8908.77s -> 8912.05s]  What you're oh the oh, that's cool. You can just club them with it. Yeah
[8913.52s -> 8917.92s]  What I think that's so cool. You like the reason it's hand mounted is so that you don't misplace it
[8918.32s -> 8922.00s]  I remember hearing the lore. Oh, so it's like attached to me. So I don't yeah
[8922.56s -> 8924.56s]  You don't accidentally drop it someplace
[8925.44s -> 8928.79s]  I think i'm gonna be uh, i'm gonna upgrade andy on this one. I think
[8929.59s -> 8931.54s]  Yeah
[8931.54s -> 8933.78s]  Oh, it's got a forward punch as well. What's the charge?
[8933.86s -> 8938.42s]  It feels so good when you find a weapon that you like mesh well with, you know, yeah, that's how I feel about this staff
[8939.54s -> 8944.58s]  The game is changed. There's other staffs too. So like if you start using this one and then you try other ones later
[8951.81s -> 8953.81s]  Oh
[8954.37s -> 8956.53s]  Geez the call out of barrel
[8957.17s -> 8968.26s]  All the uh, the magic looks awesome from the staff cool
[8968.26s -> 8973.54s]  But I really feel like i'm doing nothing for the team here. I think it like leaves a burning area on the ground
[8978.16s -> 8980.16s]  That yeah, yeah
[8981.44s -> 8984.26s]  Yeah, that just happened. I

[8991.22s -> 8993.52s]  Yeah, that
[8993.52s -> 8995.28s]  Just happened

[9352.58s -> 9355.14s]  This thing actually is everything I wanted. It's awesome
[9355.86s -> 9358.87s]  I love the sound it makes
[9360.39s -> 9362.39s]  A little grenade. Oh, it's like a cannon. Yeah
[9363.43s -> 9364.71s]  It's fun to use
[9364.71s -> 9366.71s]  oh, so for this one, uh the
[9367.51s -> 9371.51s]  The thing is gonna go down and one of us has to use it to start a mini game turn it back on again
[9371.59s -> 9373.27s]  because right now

[9378.23s -> 9384.07s]  What the hell is this so you gotta click when it's highlighting over the glowy bit, right? Oh, okay
[9386.95s -> 9391.67s]  Guys i'm getting hurt real bad. Should we have let the person that can't count to four do this
[9393.11s -> 9396.79s]  Technically augerins are the slowest at doing it than ever anyone. Oh, are you really?
[9398.47s -> 9405.54s]  It's not there's literally one guy here. What happened? Yeah. Yeah. Well, there were plenty more but I managed to take them out

[9426.44s -> 9429.96s]  They got tired of us. I promise i'm not doing this wrong. It is really slow
[9431.40s -> 9436.01s]  Dude, I love this stuff
[9436.09s -> 9440.70s]  You may have any ammo when you were
[9444.52s -> 9447.08s]  Thank you guys think you can learn magic when you were younger
[9447.08s -> 9451.08s]  I would really practice telekinetic stuff
[9452.04s -> 9456.84s]  Do you tell me like real magic you wanted to move stuff? Yeah when I was little I really wanted to be magic
[9457.16s -> 9458.44s]  You ever get close?
[9458.44s -> 9460.74s]  I've been that same world
[9460.74s -> 9465.14s]  You did what in that same world when I was younger? I wanted to be a magic wand maker
[9465.94s -> 9468.18s]  Only like the all-even-under guy
[9468.58s -> 9472.82s]  But this is this is way before that though before he existed. You're like you invented the concept
[9473.06s -> 9479.14s]  Well, by the way, this is not like harry potter style magic this is I think magicians on stage magic
[9480.39s -> 9482.63s]  You know what I mean? It's probably a pretty big market for that
[9484.23s -> 9486.63s]  What is involved with making the wand like I don't know
[9487.99s -> 9493.51s]  I wish I could ask my former self little handkerchiefs out of it. There's got to be a secret compartment or two
[9495.27s -> 9497.59s]  Yeah, I need to brush up on like magic
[9498.47s -> 9503.11s]  Just like you wanted to be a magician you wanted to provide a service to magicians
[9503.51s -> 9508.23s]  Despite not knowing how the magic works itself. Yeah, I didn't know the first step of making it
[9509.19s -> 9511.19s]  Not to provide it not at all
[9511.59s -> 9516.71s]  Oh, yeah, I I just figured I wanted to be a magic wand maker not a magician
[9517.67s -> 9521.75s]  That's how you make the money in the magic world, right? So that's good business sense smart kid
[9526.66s -> 9530.34s]  Like the uh, the people who made it rich in the gold rush for the ones selling the mining supplies
[9531.62s -> 9533.62s]  Yeah
[9534.89s -> 9536.89s]  Very low, please
[9543.14s -> 9547.69s]  nice
[9547.69s -> 9553.13s]  Oh also looking for grim wars. I totally forgot to even mention that they're like little flowy books
[9554.17s -> 9558.97s]  Oh, that's where like extra. Yeah, that's for extra experience at the end probably already missed one, but
[9560.01s -> 9561.29s]  It's okay
[9561.29s -> 9563.93s]  No, I feel like we'll get all three this time. We're capable
[9564.65s -> 9566.57s]  All three out of two
[9566.57s -> 9568.87s]  All three out of two
[9571.94s -> 9574.50s]  Let's get some uh, I want more um
[9574.98s -> 9577.93s]  I want my ammo on this thing. I'm definitely going to upgrade it
[9582.07s -> 9584.23s]  It's addicting oh, here's that ammo right here
[9588.71s -> 9595.67s]  Just don't go shooting navigators or sanctioned psychers you get in trouble for that shut up
[9597.90s -> 9604.38s]  Geez, okay
[9604.38s -> 9606.81s]  Look at this. So a little
[9607.61s -> 9609.61s]  Uh
[9622.73s -> 9626.01s]  Like an embroidered pillow, yeah throw pillow
[9629.77s -> 9631.77s]  That would not be a bad existence
[9632.17s -> 9634.41s]  Unless it's painful
[9634.49s -> 9638.97s]  I'm sure it's very painful, you know, yeah, probably having your nerves bound to like metal would
[9639.45s -> 9642.41s]  Probably suck. I think like the process like most
[9643.29s -> 9647.29s]  Lose consciousness and like aren't sentient anymore, but some retain it somehow
[9648.01s -> 9650.01s]  and they're just like
[9650.57s -> 9654.41s]  Like I would be just I would still feel it probably yeah with your luck. Yeah
[9657.26s -> 9659.21s]  Hey
[9659.21s -> 9662.10s]  Where are you?
[9662.10s -> 9665.75s]  Who this guy shooting across the balcony over there?
[9670.71s -> 9673.35s]  Ammo here. Yeah, I think I got enough
[9674.25s -> 9679.21s]  I can't use ammo anymore. I'm now a spiritual being I cast I cast magic
[9680.63s -> 9682.63s]  That just seems like kind of a fun character
[9683.64s -> 9685.64s]  That seems like a fun character actually
[9685.72s -> 9689.18s]  It is it's pretty cool. I love this little spell
[9694.09s -> 9698.97s]  Oh, uh, is this healed? No, never mind just computer this way
[9699.69s -> 9704.42s]  I don't know we're down where they're at. Oh
[9707.14s -> 9711.46s]  Are we going the right way or you guys are going the right way? Uh, it's down here where snot knees
[9712.42s -> 9717.94s]  Uh, why am I the only one that gets snagged by this little bug zapper net? Oh, there's fire. Goodbye
[9721.05s -> 9723.80s]  This is the worst oh
[9727.56s -> 9733.58s]  I'm fine. I'll be fine. Wait, how did I get back up? I think you can help you can uh press e
[9734.62s -> 9735.74s]  grenade
[9735.74s -> 9745.13s]  But there's something green back here. Was that a tome? I think I got one of the
[9746.25s -> 9748.25s]  Oh you did nice
[9748.65s -> 9750.65s]  So if you die with it it goes
[9752.33s -> 9754.33s]  But there's healing over here
[9755.05s -> 9760.81s]  Or snot down. Oh down there. Yeah, what's that thing on the map? It's like a icon. What's that? Oh, yeah snot
[9760.81s -> 9762.09s]  You should get this too
[9762.09s -> 9763.85s]  Uh, what I can
[9763.85s -> 9765.85s]  Oh, it's the heal icon. Okay
[9765.93s -> 9774.89s]  Like I didn't even know he died
[9780.15s -> 9790.57s]  Everything you've told me so far makes me want to learn about the lore of warhammer
[9791.53s -> 9794.01s]  Yeah, right it's it's addicting once you like learn a little bit
[9794.97s -> 9797.77s]  uh, my two favorite concepts in warhammer are
[9798.73s -> 9799.93s]  like
[9799.93s -> 9802.97s]  Hive cities, which is where we are and then uh,
[9803.61s -> 9809.29s]  Just like how distance works and like time is really actually original and you can hit by the train
[9809.69s -> 9811.69s]  so like go through the warp and like
[9811.85s -> 9813.85s]  Come out years later. Sometimes like
[9814.49s -> 9816.65s]  Yeah, it's like inconsistent. Yeah
[9817.61s -> 9821.29s]  I don't want to waste em. I'm definitely falling down the uh, it's a servitor radio
[9822.17s -> 9824.17s]  Wait, let me talk to him
[9824.49s -> 9828.82s]  Nothing in there
[9830.42s -> 9833.78s]  Dude what a funny idea just like punishing people by turning them into shit
[9834.92s -> 9836.92s]  That is so funny. I want to be a little dude
[9837.72s -> 9844.12s]  I need to make an entire game about being a servitor
[9845.40s -> 9847.40s]  And you just stand around
[9847.48s -> 9849.30s]  Yeah
[9849.30s -> 9851.30s]  You just watch people go and have fun
[9851.38s -> 9855.48s]  I have no i'm not I can't hit anybody. Come on, man
[9865.10s -> 9867.10s]  It would be like prop hunt
[9867.50s -> 9870.10s]  But like you don't move
[9870.10s -> 9874.18s]  You're so so bad. No, you you wouldn't have said anything unless I said that first
[9875.70s -> 9879.85s]  I saw that

[10058.38s -> 10066.15s]  Nice does that box not heal if you've got purple? Yeah, only these stations heal the purple. Oh lark

[10362.81s -> 10366.01s]  Why do you keep swinging to dead bodies because they make sure they're dead
[10366.89s -> 10368.89s]  Ha ha
[10369.37s -> 10373.85s]  I mean when you knock them over as an augurian, that's when you knock them. Yeah, sometimes they don't know
[10380.25s -> 10389.26s]  The flamer
[10389.88s -> 10391.88s]  Oh, all right, it's not got you

[10462.28s -> 10464.28s]  Don't even there's like three of them that's why
[10464.52s -> 10469.48s]  It's just I thought I could beat him over here another flamer
[10470.97s -> 10472.33s]  how
[10472.33s -> 10474.60s]  Put this out
[10474.60s -> 10477.88s]  Put this out. Are you blowing on it? Seriously? It was there for too long
[10479.26s -> 10481.26s]  Augur never learned to stop dropping the roll

[10499.82s -> 10501.90s]  Oh, wait, there we go. I think I got it. Yeah
[10502.46s -> 10507.61s]  I think that's the last one
[10507.61s -> 10509.61s]  Uh, we need one more
[10509.93s -> 10514.33s]  You're holding a big guy. Oh, I thought there was two slots. Okay, so we're good. We're good
[10516.17s -> 10518.97s]  So trouble if you shove people off this bridge, yeah
[10520.09s -> 10523.13s]  Oh, i'm gonna do that. Oh my god, this is gonna be so epic
[10525.21s -> 10527.21s]  Get to the helicopter
[10530.25s -> 10532.55s]  What's the lore name for it
[10532.95s -> 10536.47s]  Uh, that's a helicopter in the lung. Yeah, they just call it
[10538.15s -> 10543.98s]  Let's go. All right, i'm gonna bump them. Did I do it? That didn't work
[10545.42s -> 10547.42s]  All right, wait, we gotta be careful

[10550.54s -> 10554.46s]  Get in get in i've got to get on 20. I can't get on the platform
[10556.41s -> 10558.41s]  Can I jump the jump? Okay, there we go
[10558.89s -> 10560.89s]  No
[10565.70s -> 10571.46s]  Nice I got I probably got at least 60 or 70 there. I'm tired. You see me all tuckered out
[10574.44s -> 10576.44s]  Cool so we're gonna be level five
[10576.82s -> 10587.58s]  Yeah, you'll definitely hit the five
[10587.58s -> 10589.58s]  I just unlocked a dueling sword
[10591.50s -> 10593.50s]  Oh, wait, that one's super fun
[10593.82s -> 10597.66s]  It's like uh, you're basically holding it's like a you look a pirate. You have like a little cutlass
[10598.22s -> 10605.34s]  Oh really? Yeah, it looks so goofy. I unlocked um traits. That's like a skill points, right? Yeah, so those
[10605.90s -> 10611.90s]  Every five levels you can allocate you can change them whenever so you don't have to like respect or anything really and yeah, and they
[10612.70s -> 10615.82s]  Are like really good buffs for your class based on how you like to play them
[10616.46s -> 10623.40s]  Let's take a look
[10623.40s -> 10626.04s]  Do you guys want uh another fourth to jump in or?
[10627.18s -> 10634.38s]  Um, good either way, but yeah, i'm totally down for either. I I know uh stripping is available. Uh, germa if you want to see
[10635.02s -> 10638.86s]  Stripping's got a level 30 augren. It's really cool like the full
[10639.66s -> 10644.70s]  The full power of the eventual augren is oh my goodness. I just unlocked a new shirt
[10645.62s -> 10650.10s]  I kind of want to see that too. So i'll back out and let's trip enjoy and then we can see like what high level stuff
[10650.10s -> 10651.30s]  Looks like
[10651.30s -> 10655.46s]  Um, whatever. Yeah, I mean you want you want to do you want to just do one more and then we'll get stripping it
[10655.86s -> 10658.50s]  Oh, yeah, that's fine. If you want to do another one. Yeah, we'll do one more
[10660.71s -> 10663.11s]  You kind of want to see what like the high level unlocks look like
[10664.26s -> 10667.14s]  I only knocked five people off the ledge back there guys
[10668.02s -> 10670.34s]  Out of how many 70 I have to get 20
[10671.46s -> 10672.42s]  Okay
[10672.42s -> 10676.02s]  Well, what's this? I have to pick one of these two hit four. I don't know what that unlocks
[10682.14s -> 10685.93s]  Wait, I can change my can I change this?
[10686.57s -> 10692.90s]  Wait, there we go the feed if you just click on it, it'll equip the different one
[10693.46s -> 10695.46s]  Oh, I thought I could do something up here, too
[10696.01s -> 10699.61s]  Oh, no, those are that's just default. Those are default. I think for now
[10699.61s -> 10705.53s]  But eventually there's like gonna be other subclasses. I think so like i'm a zealot preacher and eventually you can be like a zealot
[10705.85s -> 10707.42s]  I don't know
[10707.42s -> 10721.46s]  Matic or something. So I gotta pick between these three. Yeah, I think i'm gonna keep my current staff
[10721.54s -> 10723.62s]  I feel like it's this one. I feel like it's the this one here
[10726.36s -> 10728.36s]  Just 100 toughness replenishment
[10729.18s -> 10736.28s]  That seems just great. What are the uh, there's little icons on weapons. I don't know what each one means
[10738.10s -> 10739.46s]  Yeah
[10739.46s -> 10743.70s]  See the oh inspect maybe inspect shows what they mean. No. Oh it does. There we go
[10743.78s -> 10747.54s]  If you inspect it shows on the right side what each of those icons mean
[10748.74s -> 10750.34s]  Flushed right down
[10750.34s -> 10754.38s]  Did I unlock any other clothes?
[10754.38s -> 10758.14s]  I got just a shirt on my guy and I look even stupider when I don't have the full
[10758.78s -> 10760.38s]  little onesie
[10760.38s -> 10762.70s]  People saying that I have a this is a dad shirt
[10764.70s -> 10770.06s]  Is that your new shirt that tank top? Yeah, it's just like a dirty tank top. I think it looks good
[10770.62s -> 10772.62s]  I think it's like you yeah
[10773.75s -> 10777.48s]  Oh everybody, let's go check the weapons because it could be new
[10778.04s -> 10781.69s]  Actually, hold on same weapons
[10782.01s -> 10784.01s]  20 minutes
[10784.01s -> 10788.17s]  For you carry with you martial tokens of the omniscience blessings
[10788.81s -> 10790.81s]  Got a new axe
[10792.63s -> 10797.08s]  Oh
[10797.08s -> 10800.76s]  So is the only way for me to get that little sword we're talking about kraken is if it just
[10801.24s -> 10803.24s]  Is in the shop like when it refreshes?
[10804.12s -> 10805.40s]  um
[10805.40s -> 10808.28s]  Yes, unless did it say emperor's gift and
[10809.30s -> 10810.50s]  the end of the match
[10810.50s -> 10813.22s]  Um, I don't really read I don't do that
[10813.30s -> 10818.90s]  So if you check your you might have it because sometimes at the end of the match you just get a free weapon from
[10819.14s -> 10820.66s]  the emperor
[10820.66s -> 10824.98s]  Because he's very generous amazing. Yeah, I don't think i'm gonna buy anything. I just keep what I have
[10827.77s -> 10834.42s]  What the?
[10834.42s -> 10853.83s]  Family reunion. All right that that was a 3d movie. I've had 3d glasses. That'd be crazy

[10863.38s -> 10868.18s]  I don't have a flashlight anymore. I sold the gun with the flashlight. Okay, that'd be the only one maybe
[10874.04s -> 10875.88s]  My guy's so ugly
[10875.88s -> 10880.70s]  Does the barber let you do like full cosmetic change or just hair?
[10882.14s -> 10883.82s]  uh
[10883.82s -> 10887.26s]  This this haircut just makes me look like such like a goofball
[10890.20s -> 10892.20s]  That's like your mom gave you that haircut
[10893.32s -> 10895.32s]  Have you seen where the barber is?
[10895.48s -> 10899.16s]  Yeah, I I had something else before maybe you can get one similar to mine
[10899.80s -> 10902.36s]  Yeah, somebody said I have the mo the three stooges cut. Yeah
[10903.70s -> 10912.57s]  Uh, i'll keep it. I'll keep it. So what's this one? Uh, this is the normal one. Oh no lights out

[10945.64s -> 10947.72s]  Um, you better check stuff. Exactly
[10948.28s -> 10951.54s]  Are these passives or do I have to do something?
[10952.10s -> 10953.14s]  They're passives
[10953.14s -> 10957.38s]  You just have to select one of the three and it just will be on you permanently. Oh my god
[10957.38s -> 10960.42s]  There's too like there's too many words, dude. I thought I'd just pick one at random
[10962.97s -> 10966.01s]  We said just remember do you dye your hair? No, I don't this is
[10967.18s -> 10970.78s]  Weirdly enough and this is actually a good thing. But you know, obviously knock on wood
[10971.42s -> 10972.46s]  um
[10972.46s -> 10974.46s]  I don't have any gray hair
[10975.14s -> 10977.94s]  And that's a little concerning because i'm getting a little older
[10979.45s -> 10982.33s]  I don't have any gray hair
[10982.41s -> 10988.31s]  I'm not looking forward to when I look in the mirror and there's just white hairs here. We'll see
[10992.73s -> 10993.61s]  Yeah
[10993.61s -> 10995.85s]  Let's move. We look so cool
[10996.65s -> 10998.65s]  We did just look really cool
[10999.45s -> 11003.61s]  So it'll be the same kind of layout, but will the mission be the same every time we'll change it up
[11005.45s -> 11009.53s]  Yeah, usually the things that change are the secondary objectives and
[11010.65s -> 11012.65s]  Whatever other modifiers around the level
[11013.37s -> 11015.37s]  You end up doing the same mission a lot
[11018.57s -> 11023.37s]  So I guess like any of those other modifiers, well, I think after this we can probably try a level three
[11023.69s -> 11025.53s]  Especially if sam's joining
[11025.53s -> 11030.97s]  Well, it's also I mean the levels are they're supposed to be played over and over again. That would be yeah very different
[11032.49s -> 11035.77s]  I feel like a dark modifier from two to three is very dramatic. Yeah
[11036.33s -> 11045.58s]  Change a lot of it. Yeah. All right. No, i'm not gonna waste any ammo not like last time
[11055.90s -> 11057.98s]  Wait, are we looking for grimoires again in this one?
[11059.06s -> 11064.02s]  See the mission thing it's just the last time it appeared I think under the main objective
[11065.30s -> 11066.66s]  No
[11066.66s -> 11068.82s]  Kraken, can I get a lore update on what i'm looking at here?
[11069.54s -> 11071.54s]  Did I miss his I punched what?
[11073.66s -> 11075.10s]  disco ball
[11075.10s -> 11078.06s]  Oh, no, wait a second. There's a skull on it. This is a sever
[11084.47s -> 11091.32s]  Test in past
[11092.04s -> 11104.42s]  Right in the teeth
[11104.42s -> 11106.44s]  Already ammo
[11106.44s -> 11107.40s]  cool
[11107.40s -> 11114.57s]  So kraken, do you have any do you have any blues?
[11115.77s -> 11117.77s]  Uh, yeah, so you have blue right now
[11120.90s -> 11122.90s]  I have one purple
[11123.70s -> 11125.38s]  You have a purple
[11125.38s -> 11126.52s]  Yeah
[11126.52s -> 11127.56s]  You can
[11127.56s -> 11129.56s]  I mean at the level you're at you start getting purples
[11130.65s -> 11132.65s]  Oh like purple weapons. Yeah
[11145.27s -> 11158.07s]  It didn't hit oh my god, what's your favorite bit of warhammer war?
[11159.56s -> 11161.16s]  uh
[11161.16s -> 11162.49s]  oh
[11162.49s -> 11163.69s]  I
[11163.69s -> 11165.66s]  What's that sound?
[11166.62s -> 11169.91s]  Okay, cool
[11169.91s -> 11172.60s]  I like just the concept of like
[11173.72s -> 11175.72s]  so the the empire
[11175.88s -> 11180.04s]  you know colonizes thousands and thousands of planets and then
[11181.32s -> 11185.16s]  Some shit goes down and they basically can't travel for like a few thousand years
[11186.60s -> 11190.20s]  And so these planets these colonies just don't hear back from
[11190.92s -> 11193.00s]  You know the emperor for thousands of years
[11193.72s -> 11197.16s]  And then they show up one day and they're like, all right time to pay back the back taxes that you owe
[11197.64s -> 11203.16s]  Everyone's like no, fuck that and then they just burn their planet and take it back. They're like, no, fuck you. This is our planet
[11203.48s -> 11205.48s]  Oh the empire
[11206.50s -> 11208.92s]  Exactly. Sorry. I forgot I was streaming
[11210.68s -> 11212.68s]  I was just like blocking in playing
[11213.72s -> 11216.47s]  This game does that man. I just like
[11223.35s -> 11230.81s]  How are you still alive shit, uh, there's a lot of people over here
[11231.53s -> 11246.63s]  with the actual
[11251.03s -> 11254.81s]  Too much magic. Oh, right. That's the thing. I forgot to pace myself
[11260.87s -> 11262.87s]  Thanks for the help fellas
[11268.52s -> 11270.20s]  I actually need that
[11270.20s -> 11272.20s]  Sorry, uh, you get the next one
[11273.43s -> 11282.44s]  Oh, oh, yeah. Yeah, you probably needed to do though. We have to share it to find a big uh, ammo case somewhere
[11283.08s -> 11286.60s]  I think that's like a full ammo refill for everyone. Yeah, here's you know
[11287.56s -> 11288.68s]  Oh
[11288.68s -> 11294.30s]  Oops, you're a person
[11294.30s -> 11297.58s]  Did you just shoot? Oh, there's a tried over there
[11299.54s -> 11301.30s]  grenades anybody grenades
[11301.30s -> 11304.57s]  Ammo here for you smush
[11308.73s -> 11315.08s]  That's a good question are there any dances in the game not that I've found
[11317.26s -> 11320.38s]  We could come up with one like this. Oh, yeah
[11321.02s -> 11324.47s]  Oh, wait, there is actually hold on. Is there ready? Yeah, look at me
[11328.49s -> 11330.49s]  Wait, I did it wrong
[11331.45s -> 11340.18s]  Oh, it's a slide can I do that if you run and slide and then spin around looks freaking sick. Yeah
[11342.74s -> 11344.74s]  Cool that was pretty cool
[11344.90s -> 11347.78s]  Oh, oh, he actually calls out who has the lowest ammo. I guess
[11348.42s -> 11353.22s]  Yeah, that's cool. Oh, if you actually look uh next to all of our names, there's a little ammunition
[11353.70s -> 11360.02s]  Yeah, it's fine based on the color of it is how much ammunition. Oh like the game automatically like called out big man
[11363.14s -> 11365.14s]  Dog just hit a front flip
[11366.70s -> 11371.98s]  All right, don't waste ammo. Let's stop it. Okay. I just love shooting the grenade. Wait, can I heal on that thing?
[11372.94s -> 11373.98s]  Yeah
[11373.98s -> 11375.98s]  I don't know if there's any left. Yeah
[11378.95s -> 11388.04s]  I'll get it
[11388.60s -> 11390.60s]  What the hell was that?
[11390.84s -> 11392.92s]  He just got his head shot almost all the way off
[11393.72s -> 11399.48s]  He shot me through the wall. That was so that was sad. Prykin? I'm gonna take care of him
[11400.44s -> 11403.64s]  Prykin? What? You all right? Yeah
[11405.40s -> 11407.32s]  Okay. All right
[11407.32s -> 11413.08s]  Wow, it hit me too. Be careful. Where is he? I'll shoot him if I can find him. Oh, there he is. Got him
[11415.34s -> 11417.59s]  These guys are jerks
[11417.59s -> 11421.59s]  This guy I managed it on hard and harder whatever those things will kill you in one hit
[11423.59s -> 11425.59s]  That's probably sad
[11426.07s -> 11428.07s]  Okay
[11428.15s -> 11435.00s]  Let's go
[11439.32s -> 11445.96s]  Oh, yeah, maybe modifiers in general make more of the uh hard enemies
[11449.30s -> 11451.30s]  Oh
[11461.21s -> 11463.21s]  Oh boy
[11465.11s -> 11473.58s]  Oh, okay. Uh, no, come here, please
[11474.54s -> 11494.12s]  I thank you for killing that guy because I couldn't yeah, I definitely should not do that. It's way too slow
[11496.12s -> 11499.74s]  What are you doing the hacking there's a little mini game in
[11500.62s -> 11504.62s]  In this fight that you have to do. I bet snot would be pretty good at it
[11504.94s -> 11506.94s]  Yeah, you should get it. That's nice
[11507.02s -> 11512.14s]  Does that actually affect the speed of the little bar like your class? Uh, the auger does. Yeah, it's just slower in general
[11514.94s -> 11518.98s]  Oh guys, i'm not gonna lie I tried to do it but I didn't know how to
[11520.73s -> 11526.73s]  All right. I'm guarding you snot go for it. Okay, big guy. Hey guy. Oh, yeah, we've got a just a typical hack here
[11532.90s -> 11536.42s]  Yeah, we got the uh motherboard might be fried on this one guys
[11537.22s -> 11539.22s]  What's wrong with it? Uh, oh
[11539.94s -> 11544.90s]  Yeah, it just needs some. Oh, there we go. Need a little tweaking. I got it guys. It's one of those 4090s with the uh
[11545.62s -> 11550.18s]  High voltage pin, right? It catches on fire. Yeah. Yeah, exactly that you nailed it
[11551.14s -> 11557.78s]  Isn't the 4090 like as big as uh, like five bricks laid on top of each other basically, yeah
[11559.78s -> 11562.10s]  As much power as a typical household
[11567.13s -> 11571.05s]  That's what they use to wipe the cold winters to warm the winters in this universe
[11572.50s -> 11574.50s]  4090s. Yeah
[11580.23s -> 11582.23s]  It's mr. Krabs
[11591.72s -> 11596.65s]  Right into the fire
[11596.65s -> 11600.89s]  Uh snot more uh more hacking up for you if you want. All right, let's see what I can do
[11605.29s -> 11607.29s]  Game is fun as fuck
[11612.18s -> 11617.78s]  Yeah, I like this like especially what you said after getting a weapon. That's more your play style. Yeah
[11619.40s -> 11621.70s]  That changes so much
[11621.78s -> 11626.90s]  Okay, getting this uh axe versus the shovel like i'm actually killing people with melee now, which is nice
[11628.02s -> 11630.42s]  Oh snot need some gatorade i'm getting hurt
[11631.38s -> 11636.54s]  My electrolytes are all screwed up. Mr. Krabs is my favorite warhammer character
[11641.32s -> 11649.10s]  They're actually the slaneshi demons all have like crab claws and tentacles and shit do they yeah guy's throwing a grenade
[11652.39s -> 11657.52s]  Is he still alive oops
[11660.30s -> 11663.42s]  Don't help him let him think about what he's done. Yeah, he's got to learn the hard way
[11664.94s -> 11668.48s]  I start pinching his fingers. Yeah, just start like stepping on my fingers
[11681.16s -> 11683.16s]  Yeah, it's been like three oh
[11684.04s -> 11689.96s]  Oh, I thought it was only when the power was out. I thought it was the powers up. I'm gonna break them. I'm gonna break them
[11691.08s -> 11703.90s]  This is bad guys. This is very this is very bad. I would say
[11705.18s -> 11707.18s]  Oh snot's down too. I put down healing
[11708.06s -> 11712.82s]  Uh, what no he's choking you. Yeah
[11713.62s -> 11715.62s]  I don't know if we can kill him in time. Where's the healing?
[11721.13s -> 11722.73s]  No more shouty
[11722.73s -> 11725.29s]  Where'd he go? Oh, he's gone. It's like a witch. I guess
[11727.53s -> 11729.93s]  Other than that dark mission I guess where you have to kill it
[11731.53s -> 11733.53s]  Wait, I disturbed him
[11733.61s -> 11736.73s]  No, I did buddy. Oh, we lost two. He's dead, too
[11738.17s -> 11741.79s]  He died separately he died unrelated cut we have to rescue
[11742.11s -> 11744.11s]  Natural
[11744.35s -> 11746.59s]  Wow that fucking hurts
[11747.87s -> 11750.36s]  I'm gonna pass you a note. We're gonna go rescue
[11752.36s -> 11756.44s]  All right, we're good. Yep. We just gotta keep up keep ourselves alive until we just run it
[11758.44s -> 11761.56s]  Where are they down here up ahead? Yeah, they're both down there each other
[11762.20s -> 11765.96s]  Oh, we got a swarm of dudes. Oh my goodness. All right grenade
[11767.47s -> 11770.27s]  Don't yeah, i'll get him. Oh, that was a lot of bodies
[11770.67s -> 11774.20s]  I should need you. Glad you were close
[11780.96s -> 11785.18s]  Does anyone need ammo right now? Uh, I do
[11786.06s -> 11789.82s]  But if you need it more than me, I can use the knife. I have a I have an ammo box
[11789.90s -> 11793.18s]  So I can the bag. Oh cool. Yeah, I definitely need it then
[11793.74s -> 11795.74s]  Let's find a good spot where we can all get something
[11796.38s -> 11798.12s]  Right here
[11798.12s -> 11802.68s]  Oh, wait, do it. Did I I thought I did maybe I guess that wasn't what I thought it was. Is it healing?
[11803.32s -> 11806.04s]  No, I guess it was just like a big bag of ammo
[11806.04s -> 11817.10s]  Like yeah, still not familiar with what all the pickups look like like that. What is that?
[11820.70s -> 11825.07s]  What's happening giant raid is a raid who raided what happened
[11826.73s -> 11831.53s]  big raid
[11831.53s -> 11833.85s]  Huge raid. All right. Who was it?
[11834.57s -> 11837.77s]  Somebody said there was like 40 000 people. Are you serious? Who did it?
[11838.57s -> 11842.35s]  Thank you. Whoever it was
[11843.07s -> 11845.07s]  Who raided me with 40 000 people?
[11849.16s -> 11853.24s]  Oh, you're just bullshit. This was where I saw the book last time, but I don't think we have that mission, right?
[11853.48s -> 11855.48s]  No, we don't have any
[11866.76s -> 11871.66s]  You got a
[11871.66s -> 11873.66s]  Medical thing here. Oh bag. Yeah
[11874.70s -> 11875.82s]  Ow
[11875.82s -> 11877.50s]  I can do that too
[11877.50s -> 11880.94s]  I missed oh my god, that fucking hurts so bad
[11881.90s -> 11888.01s]  So is there a sound right before they fire? I I need to i'm not dodging them. I really need to dodge them
[11888.09s -> 11890.09s]  I need to remember the dodge even exists
[11890.97s -> 11892.97s]  I got one of the dodge
[11894.01s -> 11897.77s]  Excuse me, who's shooting me? There's another sniper. I think you got him
[11907.48s -> 11911.32s]  Never mind, I thought there was an outside area. There's just this giant lit up area
[11912.42s -> 11913.80s]  sanctuary
[11913.80s -> 11917.39s]  Okay, we do have an ammo box. I think we need it, right? Yeah
[11919.23s -> 11921.47s]  You missed them all they were here
[11921.47s -> 11924.83s]  It would be kind of sad. I want to push these guys off one sec to watch this
[11925.79s -> 11928.08s]  Sorry
[11928.08s -> 11930.08s]  doggy
[11930.48s -> 11933.76s]  Where are they pretty good in this game? Yeah
[11935.04s -> 11937.68s]  Oh my god, why can't we kill this dog?
[11940.40s -> 11944.08s]  Are you trying to get the push thing? Oh you're trying to do the shove. All right
[11946.40s -> 11952.96s]  Dar that's that would be so sad if 40 000 people rated and the view count did not go up by one viewer
[11954.54s -> 11959.10s]  They all left immediately. They didn't like that. That would be very sad actually
[11961.96s -> 11967.24s]  Dude 40 000 people raid. All right, here it comes. My view count goes down
[11968.04s -> 11971.29s]  That would be sad
[11971.29s -> 11976.25s]  That was a really bad idea and i'm i'm muted in the comms right now. So they're probably like what is he doing?
[11983.28s -> 11993.21s]  I'm stuck
[11993.21s -> 12001.36s]  Okay, I gotta mute. Sorry. I was muted. Oh, no, they left too
[12006.40s -> 12008.43s]  Hello
[12008.43s -> 12011.23s]  Oh, that was weird. Oh wait, did it sound like we left?
[12012.43s -> 12017.31s]  That was very funny because everyone just said that a raid of 40 000 people came in
[12018.33s -> 12020.25s]  And they would I mean there was chat was just full of shit
[12020.33s -> 12025.05s]  They were just like oh huge raid like 50 000 people i'm like who the fuck is doing that who's live right now?
[12025.85s -> 12030.25s]  And then you guys weren't like they were like, oh they all left and then like that was bull bullshit
[12030.49s -> 12032.49s]  I come back here and you guys aren't here
[12033.37s -> 12037.29s]  So it was like weird going for like an hour. Yeah, you looked over and you're streaming
[12038.09s -> 12040.73s]  Just to a party of zero and you've just been alone
[12042.09s -> 12045.02s]  That would be terrifying
[12045.02s -> 12047.58s]  Do you guys have stress dreams about streaming? Yep
[12048.46s -> 12049.58s]  worse
[12049.58s -> 12055.42s]  The classic the you i'm i'm live while i'm lying in bed and I didn't need to be entertaining you want to go around
[12055.74s -> 12060.70s]  Let's go around the uh, let's go around the table here. What's what's your what's your like nightmare stream dream?
[12061.90s -> 12063.90s]  I was actually the other day
[12063.90s -> 12068.30s]  I was thinking about how lucky I was because I have stress dreams about like school stuff
[12068.86s -> 12070.86s]  Like i'm trying to like find my class
[12071.18s -> 12073.98s]  But I was like, you know what? I was telling my chat. I don't have
[12074.54s -> 12079.26s]  Stress dreams about streaming that's I feel like I should have by now and then like that night
[12079.34s -> 12081.66s]  I had a dream that my camera was on
[12082.38s -> 12085.26s]  And I like was basically face revealing on accident

[12239.64s -> 12241.64s]  I'll like just randomly
[12241.80s -> 12244.68s]  Talk like i'm on stream like there's a certain cadence to your voice when you're on stream

[12724.74s -> 12727.06s]  They can dish it but they can't take it. I know it's not fair
[12727.70s -> 12733.38s]  That's really the chat experience in a nutshell, isn't it? They can dish but they can't take
[12735.37s -> 12738.01s]  It's different because ours is true. And well
[12740.55s -> 12742.55s]  You should start training them to like

[13162.04s -> 13166.68s]  Six or seven years. Yeah. Yeah, I'm like a 20 on my main. So uh
[13167.64s -> 13172.22s]  Okay, well it's not though. Yeah, it's not six
[13174.04s -> 13176.86s]  Uh, okay
[13176.94s -> 13178.94s]  Yeah, nice posture
[13179.75s -> 13181.75s]  Okay, we could do a three with no
[13181.99s -> 13184.23s]  Uh modifiers or we could try and do like a light
[13184.31s -> 13188.23s]  I think it lights out to you because you get extra xp if you do lights out. That's why it's good. But
[13189.27s -> 13193.67s]  I think they haven't done a three before we should try. Okay. Yeah, let's do a three in daylight if we can
[13193.83s -> 13197.11s]  Yeah, where it's a little intimidating because we've never we're very new
[13198.07s -> 13200.70s]  You guys will do fine
[13200.86s -> 13205.91s]  Okay. All right. I've been struggling. I will say
[13206.95s -> 13211.51s]  Maybe you got your new staff. Yeah, I got the staff and the new knife
[13212.31s -> 13218.82s]  And i've gotten a lot of confidence the first missions. Look at that shield. Where'd you get that shield?
[13220.15s -> 13223.43s]  Soon, you will have a shield of your own. Oh damn smush
[13223.99s -> 13226.92s]  Looking good. Yeah, I cleaned up a little
[13228.36s -> 13230.36s]  I just took the clippers and just went like this
[13230.92s -> 13235.88s]  Um a few times a bit. Yeah as well grew up about 25 years
[13237.22s -> 13242.36s]  You like you guys like my sword that last mission was that bad, huh? That you aged significantly
[13244.65s -> 13247.69s]  We've been all look at these two lads. Oh my god
[13248.73s -> 13250.81s]  I feel like we're pissed to be in the same room together here
[13252.41s -> 13256.49s]  I want to see a full auger and team in this hill thing. It just crashes in the low
[13256.73s -> 13258.73s]  Doesn't even make it to the mission
[13259.69s -> 13263.05s]  I've been in the full auger team and it was a hot mess. No, it's the boys
[13263.85s -> 13268.33s]  Yeah, we're gonna do the boys here. Do you have to be balanced like an overwatch team?
[13269.85s -> 13273.77s]  Uh, it helps it helps but you don't have to like for example, we don't
[13274.41s -> 13278.17s]  We need someone that can kind of take out snipers and I don't really see in this group
[13279.21s -> 13281.21s]  Oh, i'll i'll handle that
[13281.21s -> 13282.65s]  Okay
[13282.65s -> 13287.85s]  Wait, i brought the flamers. Oops. Yeah, I don't have anything to deal with them either. Jeremy if you want to take a look at my gun
[13288.17s -> 13290.17s]  Yeah, what do you got like this one
[13291.29s -> 13293.29s]  What is that oh my goodness
[13298.04s -> 13300.54s]  Wow
[13307.29s -> 13312.01s]  I got a cool grenade launcher on my arm. I actually enjoy that. Oh, those are our friends
[13315.75s -> 13317.75s]  This new map is also really cool
[13318.31s -> 13321.59s]  It's pretty
[13321.59s -> 13327.69s]  So this is this is on hard this is on uh, yeah three out of five
[13329.90s -> 13333.10s]  So what's after hard? Is it just four and five?
[13334.54s -> 13336.54s]  Four and five, uh, no one
[13338.90s -> 13340.90s]  in within the dev team
[13341.22s -> 13345.46s]  Has beaten five really? Oh my goodness. I don't know if any players have beaten five, but
[13346.82s -> 13349.38s]  Five is just insane. Okay. Well
[13349.94s -> 13352.62s]  We're on a three
[13352.62s -> 13361.96s]  If you get threes down, this is like the juicy
[13362.68s -> 13367.08s]  I feel like I should be hanging out with snot. This shit is busting. All right, cool
[13368.60s -> 13373.40s]  Yeah, you know what? I don't know what's I don't know what's I don't know what's going on with snob. I kind of want to kiss him
[13374.20s -> 13375.64s]  Yeah, i'm
[13375.64s -> 13378.92s]  Kind of known as the cutest one in the group has a kissable face
[13380.20s -> 13382.34s]  Are these enemies or?
[13382.34s -> 13384.34s]  Yes, it's a safe bet
[13386.02s -> 13389.42s]  We can try to make friends with them i'm sure they listen for reason
[13393.50s -> 13400.63s]  I knew you weren't dead. I that's why I always check. Yeah, so on this difficulty we get more specials in general. So
[13401.59s -> 13403.59s]  Oh
[13411.48s -> 13420.60s]  Are these the bad guys? Yep, this is my time
[13421.32s -> 13423.48s]  This is going to be perfect. I'm I can't wait to watch this
[13424.76s -> 13435.24s]  I'm not used to seeing another big another big dude. Yeah, it's actually I like it
[13436.04s -> 13441.56s]  You feel safer. Does it make you safer? I actually kind of do I do feel safer
[13443.02s -> 13445.02s]  Wait till he throws down that shield
[13446.71s -> 13449.11s]  Oh sniper i'll get help guys. I'll take care of this
[13449.83s -> 13455.34s]  Oh
[13455.66s -> 13457.98s]  Oh this look at oh my god, there's a lot of people here
[13459.26s -> 13462.84s]  Oh guys, i'm gonna blow up. I'm sorry
[13464.26s -> 13470.10s]  I was every time I play with a psycher. I hear that exact quote and it's like they already know it's too low. Oh my goodness
[13470.18s -> 13472.18s]  Oh shit, I got dog on me
[13473.88s -> 13478.41s]  Oh, this is no joke level three
[13480.04s -> 13482.04s]  Yeah, there's a big difficulty spike
[13482.12s -> 13484.17s]  From two to three
[13484.17s -> 13486.73s]  Was that flaming?
[13486.73s -> 13488.17s]  I
[13488.17s -> 13496.22s]  Didn't kill that guy
[13496.22s -> 13498.22s]  All right. We're okay
[13500.33s -> 13503.29s]  On level four you need at least one augren to even survive
[13504.17s -> 13505.05s]  Really?
[13505.05s -> 13507.34s]  Would you guys agree with that?
[13507.34s -> 13512.07s]  Yeah
[13512.07s -> 13517.11s]  I made a mistake, but you know what the like special ability the augren is. Oh, sorry
[13517.75s -> 13521.11s]  I didn't see i'm gonna tank this. Oh, no, he's in someone else
[13524.15s -> 13526.15s]  He's on he's on me he's on me he's on me
[13527.19s -> 13529.02s]  I'm gonna die
[13529.02s -> 13531.02s]  Maybe he'll be okay. Let's pick him up
[13531.18s -> 13532.94s]  No, he's dead
[13532.94s -> 13534.94s]  Okay, let's we need him to focus me
[13535.42s -> 13537.42s]  Guys i'm gonna blow up again
[13542.17s -> 13548.09s]  All right, i'll push myself too hard he's killing stop just gonna kill himself. Okay. All right. Yeah, that's fine. It's fine
[13548.81s -> 13550.01s]  shit
[13550.01s -> 13552.01s]  Oh my nerves
[13553.62s -> 13555.62s]  So he leaves after two, right?
[13555.70s -> 13556.90s]  Yeah
[13559.40s -> 13563.50s]  That was incredible it's not just gave himself as a fucking sacrifice
[13564.62s -> 13566.62s]  Yeah, it was almost wait. What just happened
[13567.50s -> 13573.90s]  So snot blew up because of his own mechanic like he overheated. Yeah while he was on the ground. Oh god
[13575.02s -> 13577.02s]  I'm stuck between two augren
[13577.50s -> 13580.14s]  Okay, okay. That's all right. Things are fine. I'm gonna throw a grenade
[13581.42s -> 13590.58s]  It didn't work for another grenade. This is a mess
[13592.09s -> 13593.21s]  Yeah
[13593.21s -> 13595.61s]  All right auger down
[13595.69s -> 13601.19s]  Sorry, I got us some more experience. I got us more xp for that
[13602.71s -> 13604.71s]  Yeah, we get for the kill
[13605.27s -> 13611.14s]  Oh boy, I love that shield. All right, there's two healing things
[13611.94s -> 13615.08s]  All right, you ready? I'm ready
[13615.16s -> 13627.77s]  The guy running that he was not really running to get away. That was very funny
[13630.79s -> 13634.15s]  Yeah, I think certain weapons like actually causes fear and they just flee
[13634.79s -> 13636.79s]  Like if you have a really explosive weapon or something
[13637.67s -> 13640.55s]  You're right. That gun is amazing. Is that purple or blue or any or what is it?
[13641.35s -> 13643.91s]  Uh, this one's a purple but you'll get this pretty soon, I think
[13649.21s -> 13652.58s]  Looks cool
[13652.58s -> 13663.59s]  That was very funny
[13665.59s -> 13667.19s]  Wait, that's me
[13667.19s -> 13669.21s]  That's you bud
[13669.21s -> 13672.07s]  Here you go
[13672.07s -> 13674.47s]  Oh my god. Thank you. It's good to be back. Nice
[13675.27s -> 13680.86s]  nice job
[13680.86s -> 13682.86s]  Yeah, this this difficulty feels
[13683.02s -> 13684.79s]  so much more like
[13684.79s -> 13686.79s]  uh intense
[13686.79s -> 13689.61s]  Somebody just called me washed up
[13690.57s -> 13694.33s]  What warranted and that person permanently jokes on them ogren's don't wash
[13695.29s -> 13696.81s]  true
[13696.81s -> 13705.59s]  More like unwashed up
[13705.59s -> 13707.59s]  Is there like a class that can heal?
[13708.63s -> 13713.86s]  No, it'd be fun to just be a little healer, dude
[13715.10s -> 13718.38s]  Get like self-heal stuff kind of as a zealot
[13720.18s -> 13722.18s]  But can't help it
[13724.20s -> 13725.80s]  Yeah, ban ban
[13725.80s -> 13728.70s]  We're doing great
[13728.70s -> 13730.07s]  life
[13730.07s -> 13732.63s]  Mods, can we dox this guy ban him for life?
[13733.59s -> 13739.67s]  Look how chilled this guy is
[13740.78s -> 13742.78s]  Oh my god
[13743.58s -> 13746.54s]  What sort of unfortunate situation occurred that led to this thing?
[13750.33s -> 13752.33s]  Why am I just shooting up here
[13753.13s -> 13756.49s]  I'm so I am so obsessed with how this looks
[13758.63s -> 13760.87s]  All the the game
[13761.03s -> 13763.03s]  Yeah, it's just like it's it's so far away
[13763.67s -> 13775.24s]  It's amazing
[13775.24s -> 13777.24s]  If you needed healing there's healing back there
[13778.12s -> 13798.20s]  Access is unpowered. I guess you don't know a if I say lifetime then it means 15 seconds. Oh my god
[13800.20s -> 13802.68s]  They're just throwing me like a little rag doll
[13812.87s -> 13816.07s]  Oh guys i'm blowing up again get away from me got him
[13817.19s -> 13818.71s]  Wait, oh shit. Oh shit. I'm sorry
[13818.71s -> 13820.31s]  I'm gonna give you a little tip here
[13820.31s -> 13825.43s]  If you're about to blow up save your ultimate if you use your ultimate when you're about to blow up it will discharge it
[13826.39s -> 13831.27s]  Is it for higher difficulties do you blow up easier this was not happening until just now
[13831.99s -> 13833.99s]  Um, did you only just put on that stuff?
[13834.31s -> 13836.31s]  I upgraded it recently
[13836.71s -> 13838.71s]  Like I don't know
[13838.79s -> 13844.79s]  Maybe i'm just paying less attention to it. Yeah, I think enemies are harder to kill so you might just be like i'm so fucking locked in
[13845.27s -> 13847.99s]  Basing it off of how many enemies I kill or something
[13849.59s -> 13854.73s]  Probably gonna happen again. I got like so locked in that I didn't even I was just like sitting here
[13854.97s -> 13858.41s]  The last like 10 straight minutes you just stopped talking to the chatter
[13859.45s -> 13864.73s]  Anything i'm just like i'm just I just I'm just like in my own head here. Just playing the video game you become an ogre
[13865.53s -> 13867.53s]  Yeah, that's what happens to me too
[13867.69s -> 13871.37s]  Yeah, dude when we started playing this like stripping first made chug
[13872.25s -> 13876.25s]  I I don't think you streamed anything else since then right sam like you've just been no just
[13876.97s -> 13878.97s]  chugged
[13883.67s -> 13886.79s]  Simple life like my uh, my wife
[13887.99s -> 13889.99s]  She pointed out that my sentences have become shorter
[13892.95s -> 13902.74s]  Just becoming an ogre everything has to be one syllable all words. Yeah, let's go grab the next one
[13904.02s -> 13914.18s]  Maybe ammo anybody need health. I kind of do i'm gonna put healing down over here. I need it
[13917.21s -> 13919.21s]  What causes the purple build up again?
[13919.53s -> 13921.53s]  going down, uh in certain
[13922.01s -> 13926.81s]  Enemies like dogs do when a mutant grabs you when a dog grabs you any of those kind of things
[13928.01s -> 13931.86s]  foxbusters
[13931.86s -> 13933.54s]  That guy. Oh
[13933.54s -> 13935.54s]  We're good
[13939.45s -> 13942.41s]  I didn't I didn't know that guy was gonna blow up on you. I just saw he was red
[13948.86s -> 13951.10s]  Yeah, i'm a bit of a i'm a bit of a too difficult
[13951.90s -> 13954.94s]  So do do you have that charge move as ogre or do you have something else?
[13955.98s -> 13957.98s]  I have that charge move. Yeah, that's um
[13958.46s -> 13964.70s]  When they add new subclasses that move will be different cool, but mine's like, um, I have an improved version from like my feets
[13966.70s -> 13969.64s]  But you use your bare feet
[13970.68s -> 13972.68s]  You know like the skill you got when you get hit five
[13973.56s -> 13974.76s]  Yeah
[13974.76s -> 13980.36s]  Yeah, so I have one of those at 30 that lets me uh charge twice as far and I can't be interrupted no matter what
[13980.68s -> 13981.80s]  That's cool
[13981.80s -> 13991.02s]  It's like i'm like, yeah, i'm gonna knock down all the big stuff. Oh, come on now they're all in
[14002.62s -> 14004.74s]  This new knife is pretty good
[14004.74s -> 14008.26s]  Oh, I need to try mine
[14008.26s -> 14010.52s]  What the heck is this?
[14010.52s -> 14027.16s]  Oh, it's a circuit breaker. Oh
[14028.04s -> 14030.79s]  I just splattered like a dead
[14030.95s -> 14033.91s]  Um, is that heel stick now I dropped it already
[14035.19s -> 14037.50s]  I got another one if you want
[14037.82s -> 14039.26s]  I saw that uh
[14039.26s -> 14046.58s]  You were pretty low
[14046.58s -> 14051.06s]  Yeah, we're we are gaming right now. I mean you guys want to see this. Oh, yeah big gaming
[14054.20s -> 14057.06s]  Keep getting extremely
[14057.06s -> 14059.26s]  Hi everyone. Sorry

[14072.12s -> 14074.74s]  You're very welcome
[14074.98s -> 14078.02s]  So we get extra money and extra experience for doing it on hard
[14078.74s -> 14083.46s]  Yes, yeah more money more experience and then if you do the modifiers you get even more money and experience
[14087.21s -> 14089.21s]  Why did I do what am I doing?
[14089.29s -> 14091.13s]  I want to be on this side
[14091.13s -> 14095.21s]  Somebody said he keeps doing the great stomp lady noise. Yeah, that's me
[14096.17s -> 14098.17s]  Oh, that is what that is
[14098.81s -> 14100.81s]  I started doing that like when I was like
[14100.87s -> 14106.25s]  17 I thought the video was so funny. So whenever I got hurt I would make that sound now. It just took second nature
[14107.77s -> 14109.77s]  Whoops, well i'm down here
[14110.73s -> 14113.13s]  That's my marvel script moment, you know
[14115.05s -> 14116.25s]  That hurts
[14116.25s -> 14118.49s]  Just keeps going up and down
[14118.49s -> 14120.49s]  Ow, don't shoot me
[14120.65s -> 14122.73s]  Oh my god, don't shoot me. I'm in trouble
[14123.37s -> 14130.87s]  Oh, i'm in big trouble here. Oh, there's a lot of a lot of shotgunners here. This is the most i've ever seen
[14130.87s -> 14132.87s]  What the fuck?
[14133.83s -> 14135.35s]  What do I do?
[14135.35s -> 14139.38s]  Okay, most of them are dead
[14139.54s -> 14141.54s]  Never not even
[14141.70s -> 14146.52s]  All right. All right. Good job. I'm gonna get inside this guy's mind watch this
[14150.63s -> 14152.63s]  The only way is forward
[14153.91s -> 14162.98s]  Stop does anybody
[14163.14s -> 14168.10s]  I need I need like a I need a little help guys. Stop it
[14169.22s -> 14173.64s]  I need we need a healing station or something
[14176.23s -> 14178.23s]  Oh, no
[14179.21s -> 14180.17s]  Oh

[14188.76s -> 14190.44s]  Well something in here
[14190.44s -> 14192.34s]  Please be ammo, please be ammo
[14192.34s -> 14197.14s]  Why would there be nothing in a box? Why would you ever close a box lock a box and have nothing inside of it?
[14197.86s -> 14201.26s]  Who put that box here? Why is this box even here?
[14202.44s -> 14204.62s]  Why do you think they're uh, you know
[14206.66s -> 14208.66s]  Something a heretic would do really
[14209.70s -> 14211.70s]  It's not what happened bud. You want to talk about it?
[14212.18s -> 14215.78s]  Well, i'm opening boxes and there's no ammo in in here. We are again
[14216.73s -> 14219.98s]  gosh
[14219.98s -> 14223.75s]  What is there anything in this one?
[14223.75s -> 14225.75s]  There we go. This one's got
[14231.46s -> 14234.26s]  Oh, they have a little like a little team guarding me
[14238.90s -> 14244.98s]  That's anybody need it or can I take it no no, you're good. Oh my god, that is a big one. Ah, oh
[14245.94s -> 14250.84s]  Oh my god, I think that explosion saved me
[14254.70s -> 14257.02s]  That's a lot of health. Look at this. Look at this little captive
[14261.32s -> 14263.32s]  I don't deserve to join the team
[14264.12s -> 14267.10s]  Not until I get some cool swag like our mascot
[14268.30s -> 14269.74s]  Ooh
[14269.74s -> 14275.27s]  Yeah, there's a hill here
[14275.27s -> 14279.59s]  Um, wait, oh these the little three things tell you how many people can use it. I see
[14280.39s -> 14281.27s]  Yeah
[14281.27s -> 14282.86s]  um
[14282.86s -> 14287.34s]  I guess people with purple should get prioritized, right? Yeah, you can grab it. That's it. That's good
[14288.38s -> 14289.42s]  Okay
[14289.42s -> 14293.50s]  I'll take it first
[14293.82s -> 14298.90s]  Yeah, next time you're about to blow up. It's not try using your old uh f
[14299.46s -> 14302.74s]  All right, i'll give it a shot. It should save you
[14304.25s -> 14307.38s]  It's not
[14307.54s -> 14309.94s]  Little snot
[14309.94s -> 14311.69s]  Where are we going?
[14311.69s -> 14313.21s]  Did it go down or up?
[14313.21s -> 14316.15s]  up
[14316.15s -> 14318.33s]  Oh, I got netted
[14318.81s -> 14321.05s]  I can't wreck it. Oh my god. Watch out. There's a big dude
[14322.25s -> 14324.25s]  He's just walking over to snot
[14325.45s -> 14329.37s]  That would did that sound weird that was I have felt headphones in and i'm like really locked in
[14329.45s -> 14331.45s]  I feel like I just sounded very weird
[14331.77s -> 14333.77s]  It was a very natural laugh. Was it though?
[14334.49s -> 14335.85s]  Yeah
[14335.85s -> 14337.85s]  You're having a good time, man
[14338.41s -> 14340.71s]  self-conscious
[14341.75s -> 14344.95s]  That poses a bigger question though, uh when you're aware of your
[14344.95s -> 14348.26s]  Love
[14356.02s -> 14358.02s]  Self-conscious andy
[14363.74s -> 14367.98s]  You know when you have two headphones in and you're really just gaming and you kind of like a speech jamming yourself
[14368.78s -> 14372.78s]  Wait, do you not usually have two headphones in this? I dude I usually
[14373.50s -> 14376.14s]  Right ear only always 100% really 100%
[14376.62s -> 14378.62s]  that's like uh
[14379.50s -> 14382.94s]  Things going on around you that you require the other info or does it just happen?
[14383.18s -> 14386.08s]  I need to be able to hear myself in a natural environment
[14387.34s -> 14390.44s]  and
[14390.44s -> 14392.44s]  Okay, hold on put it back in
[14394.82s -> 14399.14s]  No, i'm kind of with you on that because I had these headphones that were two noise canceling
[14399.94s -> 14404.74s]  And I had to like figure out how to get a live feedback so that I could like think straight
[14405.30s -> 14408.28s]  Yeah, it was weird. It feels like you're like in a sensory deprivation
[14409.62s -> 14412.98s]  Yeah, I know this like the opening but it's not even just the fact that it's
[14413.46s -> 14416.42s]  Covering my ears and the sound in both ears. It's it is
[14417.30s -> 14419.30s]  It's happening right now
[14419.62s -> 14421.62s]  Um, i'm dead
[14422.18s -> 14424.18s]  It's because of the speech jamming
[14424.42s -> 14427.19s]  Okay, this is sniper. Where's the sniper?
[14428.07s -> 14432.73s]  If you're in the corner, you're good. Just stay in the corner. Yeah. Oh what I'll help you one second
[14432.73s -> 14434.55s]  I gotta deal with
[14434.55s -> 14441.38s]  Oh my god, we're coming for you guys. I almost just blew guys
[14442.68s -> 14444.68s]  i'm getting better at managing my uh
[14444.76s -> 14449.19s]  All right. Here you go. Oh, thank you. Come here smush. Let's get you up
[14449.75s -> 14450.87s]  Thanks
[14450.87s -> 14454.34s]  nice work
[14454.34s -> 14457.70s]  Uh smush. Thanks you. Oh good good good
[14458.58s -> 14460.66s]  It's not appreciate it plus one plus one
[14461.56s -> 14466.20s]  Uh smush says that he's very grateful for all of your contributions
[14467.40s -> 14469.72s]  All right, maybe just do a voice, you know, you don't have to
[14470.44s -> 14472.44s]  freaking like i think
[14473.56s -> 14476.52s]  I think my computer just crashed my whole computer
[14477.88s -> 14479.88s]  He's walking into the wall
[14479.88s -> 14482.12s]  Is am I live? Oh my god
[14483.00s -> 14488.44s]  Oh shit the lore behind this. Why did he just disappear the warp took him am I live still?
[14489.53s -> 14490.97s]  It yeah
[14490.97s -> 14496.57s]  There's a crash that you can rejoin. Oh, okay. I don't think it shuts off your obs, but it does stutter for a second
[14496.65s -> 14498.89s]  Oh, okay. All right. I'm coming. We've had that happen
[14499.53s -> 14504.31s]  Dude, literally all my windows turned off at the same time too. It was weird now. We have darlin
[14504.87s -> 14516.02s]  I'm coming. At least I think i'm on my way if I just open the game. I'll put me right back in
[14516.98s -> 14524.70s]  Yeah, yeah. Oh cool. All right. Good. Let's go
[14528.97s -> 14529.93s]  Just waiting here
[14529.93s -> 14537.66s]  Yeah, no, you guys are good. Keep keep going. I'm joined. You don't see darlin's giving me a dirty look cool level design
[14539.46s -> 14541.46s]  We did this level once already. It's wednesday
[14544.55s -> 14546.55s]  But anyways, i'm having a
[14547.03s -> 14550.23s]  A speech jammer going on in both ears. That's why I always have to be able to hear
[14551.11s -> 14553.11s]  myself in reality
[14553.43s -> 14554.55s]  without any
[14554.55s -> 14559.72s]  Um, like filter on it. So, you know what that might help me. You have a filter on usually
[14560.28s -> 14563.24s]  Well, what I mean by filter is i'm hearing my voice
[14563.80s -> 14566.20s]  with a little bit of um,
[14566.76s -> 14572.36s]  Like dilution like diluted because i'm not getting my actual voice. I have headphones in both ears
[14572.92s -> 14579.34s]  Does that make sense? Yeah, you're hearing a muted version. Yeah, and it just messes with me so bad
[14582.62s -> 14586.70s]  something that I've never actually heard my voice when I try to start talking i'll be like
[14587.90s -> 14593.99s]  Like repeating myself when i'm trying to start talking maybe that's what it is. Maybe I have like a speech jammer thing going on
[14595.91s -> 14598.23s]  Yeah, putting one headphone in usually works
[14599.03s -> 14600.55s]  but it just
[14600.55s -> 14603.35s]  If there's any positional audio at all, you just don't get it
[14603.99s -> 14606.87s]  I have streamed before where I had the left earphone out
[14606.87s -> 14612.41s]  I usually do the left earphone out always permanently and I will not hear something coming down the left hall
[14613.34s -> 14617.10s]  And i'll turn and get hit by it and people will be like, how did you not know that was coming?
[14617.74s -> 14624.30s]  Like well because I physically don't have any knowledge into your into your right ear. Just put them both in the right ear
[14624.38s -> 14626.38s]  Squeeze both headphones into one ear
[14626.78s -> 14628.78s]  So you still get the visual cues
[14629.10s -> 14631.10s]  That's actually really funny
[14631.56s -> 14641.11s]  All right, i'm back. Oh wait, I heard that little the flamethrower guy
[14642.23s -> 14645.99s]  Yeah, right a little bunsen burning just go mono in one ear
[14647.43s -> 14650.07s]  I don't think you could even set it up that way. Can you even do that?
[14652.84s -> 14658.87s]  I think maybe I should try it. Yeah, because if you're if you're
[14663.74s -> 14667.10s]  I hope I get credit for beating the mission, right?
[14668.06s -> 14676.71s]  Yeah, you'll get credit
[14676.71s -> 14678.71s]  Back you tentacle beat. Ow
[14679.43s -> 14695.06s]  You guys see ammo could use it. Oh, I have a box I can put down. Ooh
[14699.11s -> 14702.63s]  Yeah, if you want to get at the stairs once we get this growth
[14705.19s -> 14707.91s]  I think i'm gonna train myself to deal with loud noises
[14707.91s -> 14711.91s]  I'm gonna start putting a distortion effect on my computer and turning it up to like 300
[14713.67s -> 14715.67s]  Yeah, it's like while you're watching tv
[14716.15s -> 14720.39s]  Yeah, any particular, you know end game for that or just to make myself stronger
[14720.95s -> 14723.67s]  Oh cool, you can do you can do sub alerts. They're just screaming you
[14724.39s -> 14726.39s]  Yeah, tell you enough to it
[14727.03s -> 14734.01s]  I bet there's no, uh downsides to that either. Yeah, there's no way you'd develop like
[14734.65s -> 14737.05s]  Some canon tonight is behavioral induced
[14738.41s -> 14741.85s]  It's like uh taking a little bit of poison every day to become immune dude
[14741.85s -> 14746.81s]  I actually blew out my left eardrum when I was sick like a couple of years ago
[14748.41s -> 14750.41s]  I blew my nose too hard
[14750.41s -> 14753.61s]  And it was like boom and I could feel it and it hurt
[14754.33s -> 14756.33s]  And I you know, this is for real
[14756.97s -> 14758.01s]  and now
[14758.01s -> 14763.53s]  Uh, now I have like a little tiny ear ringing in my left ear. Oh, it's horrible. Yeah, it sucks
[14764.01s -> 14767.53s]  It's not that bad. It's just have to be in a dead silent room
[14768.09s -> 14770.17s]  With no sound effects, but I I hear it
[14771.05s -> 14773.50s]  It's annoying
[14773.50s -> 14776.14s]  I feel like you think you could like blow it back, you know
[14776.94s -> 14778.94s]  Yeah, like go the other way. Yeah
[14779.26s -> 14782.70s]  I bet we could put you in a big microwave for a minute and it might fix some problems
[14784.14s -> 14789.58s]  Not even like a minute like micro dosing a microwave like put you in there for like a second another second
[14791.50s -> 14793.50s]  You grow immune to radiation
[14793.90s -> 14795.90s]  Yeah, that's how you could become immune
[14796.14s -> 14798.62s]  Yeah, that's what uh the hope did right? It is important
[14799.50s -> 14804.44s]  The chopper is full of really cool great ideas. He takes off himself in a microwave
[14805.40s -> 14808.44s]  He tick talks
[14808.44s -> 14810.28s]  Keep yawning
[14810.28s -> 14814.36s]  Uh back then I went to the I actually went to like an ent about it and
[14815.62s -> 14817.78s]  It's kind of weird because they were just like, yeah
[14818.58s -> 14819.94s]  That's it
[14819.94s -> 14821.54s]  Your ears are gonna ring
[14821.54s -> 14823.54s]  Just like is there anything I can do about it?
[14823.78s -> 14825.06s]  No
[14825.06s -> 14827.94s]  Oh, I paid for this. Okay, I paid for this advice
[14828.66s -> 14831.48s]  Well, they look they checked
[14831.48s -> 14834.92s]  There was no like real damage to my ear, but it was just like yeah, it's just the way it is
[14835.64s -> 14839.61s]  Like okay
[14839.61s -> 14842.89s]  Listen, you let me give you medical advice and I think we could probably get that here
[14850.55s -> 14852.55s]  There was this uh supplement
[14853.27s -> 14856.47s]  That had I forget what the actual supplement was but it sometimes
[14857.03s -> 14860.47s]  Maybe works for some people, but I don't know if there's even any evidence that it works
[14861.43s -> 14865.35s]  Um, what's it called? I got a specific name like an herb
[14866.89s -> 14872.01s]  All right. Oh, wow. Yeah, just eat extra just put oregano on your pizza and it'll be better
[14872.73s -> 14875.96s]  I just got hurt a lot
[14875.96s -> 14883.80s]  Oh my god, it's like an amino acid or something. I figure what it was
[14884.52s -> 14888.38s]  You just saved my life
[14888.38s -> 14891.99s]  Hey anytime
[14891.99s -> 14894.31s]  You guys look like you need a med kit
[14895.91s -> 14897.91s]  I could use I could use a med kit
[14900.98s -> 14905.00s]  Wait, there's a skull and wait
[14905.00s -> 14909.48s]  Is this a severie or what are we sharing it or are you gonna guys gonna drink most of it?
[14909.48s -> 14913.72s]  Because we I we and chug literally only got like a one sniff of that
[14914.28s -> 14918.31s]  I think like maybe there's a finite amount of healing it can do because we just yeah there is
[14918.63s -> 14921.35s]  Oh cool. He started doing any character. He's like, I can't
[14924.30s -> 14926.30s]  He takes over
[14932.66s -> 14938.50s]  Oh wait smush I got a thing for you to do you do what should I do over here? Yep. Do you have any grenades? Um, no
[14940.10s -> 14946.42s]  Grenade
[14952.81s -> 14955.85s]  If you throw a grenade at the eyeball, really
[14960.49s -> 14969.62s]  They don't want me to stand up, um, what's happening to me? What was that?
[14971.46s -> 14973.46s]  That was very weird
[14979.96s -> 14984.06s]  You did it there's more than that
[14992.34s -> 14996.76s]  Oh shit
[15001.10s -> 15003.10s]  Thanks chug

[15223.34s -> 15228.86s]  Get you access to the beta game comes out on the 30th as you see pre-order beta test november 17th and 29th
[15230.01s -> 15232.19s]  Game releases in full on the 30th
[15232.27s -> 15235.82s]  Seems like they are they're working pretty much double time here
[15236.30s -> 15241.26s]  Uh, it seems like to get some stability patches. I think and some stuff ready for the actual launch
[15242.11s -> 15244.86s]  So I will definitely be playing this again
[15245.34s -> 15247.50s]  And we'll go from there, but it's been a blast
[15248.41s -> 15256.00s]  Uh, let's keep going. We'll do one more. This should be a level where you go get slimed like nickelodeon
[15258.43s -> 15263.74s]  They put you in a big chair. Is there a map we haven't done yet. Yes
[15269.26s -> 15272.54s]  this one
[15272.54s -> 15274.54s]  this one is
[15274.70s -> 15277.50s]  rank three lights out and scriptures
[15278.46s -> 15280.54s]  so
[15280.54s -> 15284.46s]  So pretend the scriptures isn't that because you're not going to find them in the dark. Yeah in the dark
[15286.45s -> 15289.81s]  I've got quite the keen eye. Let's do lights out. I think we can do it
[15290.83s -> 15293.39s]  You want to do lights out? All right, let's do lights out
[15295.52s -> 15299.34s]  Uh also, let me clarify that when I say working double time
[15299.34s -> 15301.34s]  I don't I just mean that they're like
[15301.34s -> 15305.58s]  Dedicated to making sure the launch is good. I think they already have plans for like patches and stuff. So
[15306.14s -> 15311.47s]  Uh, I don't mean like oh they're working triple time or something. So I want to clear that up
[15312.59s -> 15324.24s]  It's called a trauma force staff. Oh, that's kind of sad. What do you need flashlights if it's dark? How are we gonna see?
[15324.88s -> 15332.64s]  Yeah, can do the do the arbons not ever get a flashlight. That's so weird. You can't just use your flame up
[15333.76s -> 15338.00s]  I don't know if the flames give off light. I think they might just be listen to what you just said
[15338.48s -> 15344.16s]  Yeah, but you know video game limitations and all that man that big bright thing coming out of your gun
[15344.96s -> 15348.48s]  It doesn't yeah, it doesn't seem to damage. Yeah, I can try it
[15349.57s -> 15354.13s]  But if it doesn't work, then i'm letting the way with holy fire. It's gonna be a little difficult
[15356.88s -> 15362.42s]  Okay, are there any new any new weapons? Did it tell you that you unlocked any when you love it up?
[15363.18s -> 15370.50s]  I yeah, I did. Let me see if I can upgrade one. Oh my god. I can afford pants
[15371.46s -> 15373.46s]  No, I shouldn't though
[15374.10s -> 15389.54s]  Also wait three minutes for a different mission. Oh, yeah, the weapon shop upgrades in three minutes, too. It refreshes my service
[15390.66s -> 15394.82s]  You want to just chill for a couple minutes and just redo all this? Okay. Okay. Sure
[15396.78s -> 15398.78s]  Want to take a look at this anyways?
[15399.10s -> 15406.35s]  Did I get any
[15406.35s -> 15409.71s]  I've done multiple missions now and I still haven't gotten this blue currency
[15412.78s -> 15415.18s]  in the shrine of all my mama's nasha
[15416.14s -> 15419.23s]  They they look like little squares in the level
[15420.59s -> 15425.15s]  This club I the only the reason why i'm not trying to buy it is because it was what I started with
[15426.03s -> 15428.82s]  But that's not how this works
[15428.82s -> 15432.50s]  Just because the you started with the default weapon does not mean oh, yeah, that's the default weapon
[15432.50s -> 15439.49s]  You don't want that thing. It's just a weapon. Should I get it? Yeah, so you can get like a really good club leader
[15439.97s -> 15447.31s]  What do you think the the way the game determines the gear you get in the shop is it takes the
[15447.71s -> 15450.75s]  Highest level piece of gear in your bag or on your person
[15451.74s -> 15455.26s]  So if you buy something even if you don't want to use it if it's like a big upgrade
[15455.42s -> 15460.30s]  It means that when your shop refreshes next time you'll have like better stuff in there. Oh, okay
[15460.62s -> 15468.51s]  That's good to know. Well, I don't know. I have enough money. You can also sell old stuff
[15468.67s -> 15470.67s]  I don't know if you've done that but if you
[15470.67s -> 15471.79s]  That's right
[15471.79s -> 15476.35s]  Press i and then hover over your items you can hold x to sell them and that's easy cash
[15477.31s -> 15484.90s]  That's actually a great I don't want to sell everything but just the stuff I probably won't use yeah, just like your old stuff
[15487.63s -> 15494.50s]  Is it bad to sell greens? No. No. No, I'll just sell get more based on the rarity too
[15506.34s -> 15508.10s]  one minute remaining
[15508.10s -> 15513.92s]  See we got up at 10k
[15524.27s -> 15526.06s]  Shouldn't have sold
[15526.06s -> 15546.19s]  Yeah, it's all right though. Watch me regret not buying this right now. It's gonna be all greens. It's been fun, but I can go over
[15546.99s -> 15548.99s]  Um, let's go over what's going on next week
[15549.98s -> 15556.32s]  I will be back on tuesday. That's something interesting going on on tuesday
[15556.96s -> 15558.72s]  i'm gonna be playing
[15558.72s -> 15566.91s]  Something I don't want to spoil it but uh stir maybe somebody else. I don't want to spoil it. I don't want to spoil it
[15567.47s -> 15570.11s]  I'm playing a fun game on the 29th
[15571.52s -> 15572.40s]  uh
[15572.40s -> 15574.40s]  We'll be playing this again on launch
[15574.80s -> 15578.34s]  So i'm actually happy about that because that's gonna be a lot of fun because they think the game's really good
[15579.31s -> 15581.31s]  and then on the first something
[15581.89s -> 15583.25s]  very
[15583.25s -> 15590.05s]  Interesting and unusual is happening not on my stream. You'll you'll hear about it very soon
[15590.21s -> 15593.23s]  So that should be fun, too
[15593.23s -> 15615.68s]  That's the plan for next week. Did did stir already talk about it? Did stir talk about it? Yeah. Oh, okay
[15618.48s -> 15620.40s]  I had the hiccups for
[15620.40s -> 15624.48s]  Like an hour straight the other day and I was almost in tears by the end of that hour
[15624.88s -> 15632.43s]  I don't think you can survive a full year. I'm telling you no no mortal man. That's too much
[15636.05s -> 15639.04s]  Okay, is this better?
[15639.04s -> 15645.38s]  Hello. Hello. Sorry. I was muted just you think you could survive a whole year of hiccuping germa
[15648.32s -> 15649.92s]  How often does it happen?
[15649.92s -> 15656.75s]  Like as on on the normal it's like every having hiccups every like 30 seconds to minute two minutes. Yeah
[15658.38s -> 15663.18s]  Yeah, no, no, I don't think so. That's what i'm saying people keep saying they could survive it
[15663.58s -> 15668.69s]  Is the money involved? Yeah, you you would get a sum of money, but that's not too important
[15668.85s -> 15672.74s]  Well, now it is very important. How much I don't know 100 a million dollars
[15672.98s -> 15675.14s]  I was gonna say a hundred away a hundred dollars
[15677.22s -> 15683.25s]  For a hundred million dollars, I think the answer is yes, but your mile your life might be at stake
[15684.03s -> 15685.87s]  No, it would just be really annoying for a year
[15685.87s -> 15690.83s]  But then you have a hundred million dollars for the rest of your life. Think about the anatomy of the human
[15690.83s -> 15693.71s]  I don't know about you guys, but sometimes my hiccups like hurt really bad
[15693.79s -> 15695.07s]  Yeah, that's what i'm saying
[15695.07s -> 15701.79s]  Like you you get the hiccups after like dude after two days of hiccuping straight even in your sleep
[15702.03s -> 15706.51s]  You're gonna be like you're gonna be on your knees like begging for someone to just like cancel the deal
[15706.91s -> 15709.23s]  You wouldn't be able to sleep. You'd like die of sleep deprivation
[15709.87s -> 15714.24s]  Well, do you but hold on but do you hiccup in do you hiccup in your sleep?
[15714.72s -> 15722.77s]  Yeah, it'll be a year straight of just hiccupping. So you wouldn't you would wake up every that wouldn't make any sense
[15722.77s -> 15728.54s]  You wouldn't be able to that's why I say it's considerate carefully. Criken doesn't want to think about it
[15728.86s -> 15734.19s]  He just thinks he can do it. You you would sign yourself up and you would just be in agony
[15735.90s -> 15738.46s]  So all the lights out ones just went away and turned into endless horde
[15738.54s -> 15745.76s]  So just back in the endless horde zone great for new mission
[15745.76s -> 15750.27s]  I don't think we've done this your body would get used to it
[15750.27s -> 15754.19s]  I think your body I think it probably would I don't know if it would happen in your rem sleep
[15754.35s -> 15757.47s]  I don't think it's possible your body like shuts down a bunch of features, doesn't it?
[15757.71s -> 15763.17s]  Yeah, but you also accepted a curse man. I don't think the curse cares about you your body's features
[15763.57s -> 15771.20s]  That's true. You're hiccupping every every 30 seconds for a year. I wonder if that muscle would get pretty buff
[15771.76s -> 15777.52s]  Oh, you would be so buff like that hiccup muscle. I wonder if you could like medically induce sleep though just hiccup through it
[15777.92s -> 15783.18s]  Yeah, definitely. You get used to it. I think your body would adapt going to crypto sleep for a year
[15783.94s -> 15787.14s]  Yeah, this is uh, this is my last one. Are you guys gonna keep playing after this?
[15788.38s -> 15793.84s]  I think we'll play a little more at least I will uh, I know I think tomato might be joining us
[15795.28s -> 15797.28s]  I don't know if i'm gonna play pizza just got here
[15798.08s -> 15802.99s]  Pizza if you think you're still going i'll uh, i'll raid you after it's over. Thanks
[15803.39s -> 15808.42s]  I mean you can just eat the pizza while playing try work like germa did remember it was good to eat on stream
[15808.42s -> 15810.42s]  What if I get the hiccups?
[15815.04s -> 15817.04s]  All right, let's make it a good one
[15823.30s -> 15825.30s]  Is that my character talking
[15825.38s -> 15826.42s]  Yes
[15826.42s -> 15828.50s]  I told you actually I picked the one that's sort of
[15829.46s -> 15834.58s]  You can see how I was mistaken for rocko the rock and roll frown. I just want like a score a mad scientist
[15834.90s -> 15839.06s]  I want four of the character that you're playing to all harmonize at the same time
[15840.02s -> 15843.23s]  Yeah, you can have multiple people all have the same voice
[15843.79s -> 15845.79s]  And just oh, yeah
[15846.03s -> 15848.27s]  Wait, so this big dude can have that little tiny voice
[15848.83s -> 15850.83s]  Uh, no, it it's classic
[15852.35s -> 15854.35s]  Didn't lie you misunderstood me
[15855.23s -> 15867.49s]  Blue this knife is good
[15867.49s -> 15869.49s]  What should I eat tonight? What do you guys think?
[15869.73s -> 15871.73s]  Any recommendations yesterday?
[15872.61s -> 15873.89s]  Uh
[15873.89s -> 15875.49s]  Thanksgiving dinner
[15876.59s -> 15882.19s]  Come on you got you you got enough to eat for like three or four days. I could just eat that some mayonnaise sandwiches
[15883.74s -> 15886.30s]  And do you want something light something?
[15886.94s -> 15893.26s]  The opposite of thanksgiving or you want to keep riding the thanksgiving train? I actually might just ride the thanksgiving wave. I think
[15894.22s -> 15900.34s]  But if it wasn't that then what what do you think?
[15902.11s -> 15906.43s]  If it wasn't that yeah, what are you guys favorite foods? Like yeah, what do you guys would say?
[15907.07s -> 15911.79s]  I feel like maybe a nice pasta dish would be like the opposite of a thanksgiving
[15912.75s -> 15914.75s]  I like it. It's a comfy one. Yeah
[15916.11s -> 15922.56s]  You know, i'll be honest ever since we went to that, uh chicken katsu place in vegas
[15922.96s -> 15927.60s]  I started ordering chicken katsu because it was so fucking good. I've been chasing the high ever since
[15928.24s -> 15930.24s]  Yeah, it's just it's just unbeatable
[15930.56s -> 15933.36s]  It was so good. It's a it's like a japanese curry
[15933.92s -> 15936.75s]  like breaded chicken
[15936.75s -> 15942.37s]  But it's like this kind of deep spice unlike other curries. It's a really interesting. Yeah, it is fantastic
[15944.19s -> 15946.19s]  That's actually not a bad idea
[15946.27s -> 15949.63s]  Is it like my favorite places to go in la was coca?
[15950.43s -> 15952.43s]  The curry was so good. Oh, I don't know if i've been there
[15953.15s -> 15954.11s]  What?
[15954.11s -> 15956.11s]  Did we go there together? Where's the sniper?
[15956.83s -> 15959.71s]  We must have we went one time for like ramen. I remember
[15960.35s -> 15962.91s]  You haven't been I don't know if you live there
[15963.71s -> 15967.95s]  Yeah, that was a big city just tell me to eat shit it can't be that big what do I do
[15969.73s -> 15971.65s]  Get some ammo pal
[15971.65s -> 15973.65s]  I got a healing crate
[15974.05s -> 15981.60s]  Well, next time you go out to eat, you know where to go
[15982.08s -> 15986.08s]  Cocoa. Oh shit. I'm having like with you guys. I'm just being a big line of gunmen
[15986.88s -> 15989.70s]  I hear a dog
[15992.32s -> 15994.35s]  Thank goodness
[15994.35s -> 16002.85s]  I would have probably died. I've been to sugarfish. Yeah sugarfish is
[16003.49s -> 16004.61s]  amazing
[16004.61s -> 16006.61s]  There's a staple out here
[16008.35s -> 16013.71s]  I'm having a really bad day a really good day. Then I'll order sugarfish. What is sugarfish? It's like sushi
[16014.51s -> 16016.67s]  Yeah, it's usually places. It's really high quality
[16020.54s -> 16022.54s]  You know, I have not had sushi in a long time
[16024.30s -> 16028.78s]  It fell off real bad for me though. I kind of stopped like wanting it off. Oh, I fell off help
[16030.05s -> 16032.53s]  Oh, oh my god. You did copernicus. Come here
[16033.57s -> 16035.57s]  Mike stuck

[16037.25s -> 16039.41s]  Oh, that's a lot of people
[16039.41s -> 16045.17s]  Uh, uh, I just panicked
[16045.17s -> 16047.17s]  I probably shouldn't have done what I just did
[16049.09s -> 16051.49s]  Oh my god, I just ran in he really should have done that
[16053.76s -> 16055.92s]  One open into oh my goodness

[16069.10s -> 16072.19s]  Yeah, I mean, come on. We're gotta

[16103.89s -> 16107.25s]  I'm telling you dude. I had the hiccups for like an hour the other day and I was like almost in tears

[16199.92s -> 16201.92s]  I need to quit the video game
[16202.40s -> 16210.24s]  There's too much going on should watch some documentary they made about the oh my god guy
[16211.76s -> 16213.76s]  Do they really dogs fucking me up?
[16214.56s -> 16216.56s]  Call the animal control they have to say
[16217.18s -> 16219.18s]  About the oh my god guy. Yeah
[16220.51s -> 16222.51s]  That movie is so weird
[16222.91s -> 16224.91s]  It it genuinely makes
[16225.39s -> 16227.39s]  Like no sense, dude

[16342.48s -> 16345.49s]  These guys aren't playing around

[16390.16s -> 16397.22s]  Oh my god, I almost blew myself up where are they even coming from that's what i'm saying. There's too many people in these places
[16398.93s -> 16402.21s]  Wait, how many people live in a hive city again? Do you know 90 billion?
[16403.09s -> 16406.39s]  90 billion 90 around in a billion
[16411.25s -> 16413.41s]  And it has 90 billion what happened

[16462.56s -> 16464.24s]  Thank goodness
[16464.24s -> 16466.24s]  Why did they call it the boomer? Huh?
[16466.32s -> 16469.52s]  Did you guys boom?
[16469.52s -> 16471.52s]  It was probably the most brilliant name
[16471.92s -> 16473.44s]  in gaming history
[16473.44s -> 16475.87s]  They probably named it before like the boomer stuff
[16477.18s -> 16478.62s]  Kind of come on
[16478.62s -> 16480.70s]  Oh before like okay boomer. Yeah
[16482.00s -> 16486.96s]  It would have been if they capitalized on that though and had like a bubble flossing or something. Oh, yeah
[16487.36s -> 16492.64s]  They were a trillion dollars. Oh, I didn't even know what that was. Sorry without even having a hiccup for a year
[16494.78s -> 16497.15s]  That little oh
[16497.39s -> 16502.59s]  There was a little a little bit of fire. Wait. Oh, you're here with me. You saw it. I did it actually accidentally
[16502.99s -> 16506.27s]  What are those goofballs doing over there? Oh, right. Sorry
[16507.79s -> 16515.38s]  Just having a little conversation. Where the hell are we don't say that because then they think we're bad gamers

[16546.94s -> 16548.54s]  it's

[16583.70s -> 16590.90s]  Oh my god, what the fuck right after we did what what happened he's gonna hurt me
[16594.98s -> 16601.70s]  Fucked on a fucking compressed air container and flew. I'm stuck. I'm dead. I'm gone forever
[16602.82s -> 16604.42s]  I can't move
[16604.42s -> 16607.44s]  I'm dead
[16607.44s -> 16613.81s]  Can you break the thing? What happened? Oh he he must I think the boss knocked me back. I was stuck on pixels
[16614.61s -> 16616.61s]  It's up to you to find this
[16618.38s -> 16629.14s]  He can handle this i've been farming the boston accent a little first might be the best one
[16632.70s -> 16634.54s]  Oh god

[16642.85s -> 16645.15s]  Oh, that's
[16645.15s -> 16648.48s]  That's the end
[16649.04s -> 16652.37s]  Fucking muck
[16652.53s -> 16656.69s]  Yeah, I went I went off the whole map it actually launched me into the sky box i'm not kidding
[16656.69s -> 16659.95s]  I was dead instantly. Yeah, that
[16660.19s -> 16666.91s]  Could not have done worse. There were like 10 snipers that instantly shot me all at the same time. That's what happened with me
[16667.55s -> 16670.11s]  And it was nothing I could have done
[16670.83s -> 16673.92s]  That's fat
[16673.92s -> 16676.93s]  That was fun
[16676.93s -> 16683.20s]  I did get some more currency. We still get paid for losing a little bit. Yeah, that's good
[16683.84s -> 16686.32s]  Get a portion doesn't just take the whole thing from you
[16686.96s -> 16690.45s]  The payee payment

[16855.95s -> 16860.43s]  But once that is very clear, it's been announced then i'll talk about it should be fun
[16861.07s -> 16865.31s]  It's going to be very interesting. I don't know how I feel about it. I don't it's actually
[16866.11s -> 16870.43s]  Something I have never even remotely considered ever trying in my whole life ever
