[4.34s -> 13.38s]  What's happening? What's up? We're playing Phasmophobia with some people.
[16.48s -> 22.93s]  Got a coffee here. I'm ready to go. Vod real? That's right.
[29.32s -> 31.88s]  Do the Luddie. All right. I'll listen.
[32.36s -> 37.80s]  I'm going to be doing VR because of the Among Us VR is coming out.
[38.80s -> 43.50s]  When I do, I will do the Luddie during when I do full cam.
[44.72s -> 47.53s]  OK. And it's going to be sick.
[48.83s -> 50.47s]  Going to be one of the best you've probably ever seen.
[50.51s -> 52.03s]  I'm just going to make that very clear.
[57.32s -> 59.72s]  Yeah. So today we're playing. I didn't tweet. Oh, shit.
[60.96s -> 63.62s]  We are playing Phasmophobia.
[63.62s -> 66.65s]  Then at dead of night.
[66.65s -> 69.41s]  Then maybe stay out of the house.
[72.48s -> 73.80s]  Nice to finally join us, dude.
[73.80s -> 76.17s]  Why were you here late?
[76.17s -> 81.42s]  Why are you talking? Why are you saying it like that?
[81.42s -> 82.38s]  Why are you saying it like that?
[82.38s -> 84.70s]  I know my I know my I know I have the radio voice today.
[85.38s -> 91.50s]  I know that every single stream, it seems, over the last five years.
[92.70s -> 94.62s]  I start out with the radio voice.
[95.80s -> 99.48s]  And then it slowly goes from this to this over the course of about seven hours.
[100.40s -> 102.84s]  I'm getting old. And that's just the way it is.
[104.78s -> 106.22s]  All right. Are we ready?
[106.22s -> 109.99s]  Are we good? Dinner is cold.
[112.55s -> 116.26s]  You change your pinned tweet.
[116.26s -> 119.07s]  Yeah. All right.
[119.07s -> 122.55s]  OK. Can I can I can all the social media managers of the channel
[122.55s -> 130.75s]  just relax for a few minutes to change your pinned tweet?
[131.83s -> 134.15s]  All right. All right. All right. All right. OK.
[135.03s -> 139.95s]  Uh, I'm I'm going to tweet a regular tweet right now as
[142.06s -> 145.75s]  asmophobic. How do you spell asmophobia?
[145.75s -> 147.86s]  Can somebody spell it?
[147.86s -> 151.06s]  Is it phasmophobia or phasmophobia?
[152.26s -> 156.34s]  It's like phasmophobia.
[156.34s -> 165.33s]  So it's phasmo. OK.
[166.85s -> 169.66s]  Asmophobia, let's go.
[169.66s -> 171.90s]  Let's get it. I like let's get it.
[171.94s -> 180.81s]  It's better. How about phasmophobia and other scary things?
[182.54s -> 187.51s]  Let's get it. Yeah, that's perfect.
[187.51s -> 189.15s]  Hope you guys are having a good day.
[189.15s -> 193.83s]  And OK, I hope you guys are having a good day.
[194.83s -> 196.59s]  Let me just say words.
[196.59s -> 200.61s]  Well, I write the tweet. There it is.
[200.61s -> 203.58s]  All right. Here we go.
[203.58s -> 205.42s]  I wonder if everybody's ready.
[205.42s -> 207.62s]  I guess I don't even know how to play phasmophobia.
[207.62s -> 209.99s]  I'm a level one.
[209.99s -> 215.54s]  I played it like a year and a half ago.
[215.54s -> 220.54s]  OK, check in and see how we're doing.
[220.54s -> 224.94s]  Fuck, I forgot I was muted for them, but not for you guys.
[224.98s -> 226.42s]  How we how we doing?
[226.42s -> 230.50s]  How do you guys feel good?
[230.50s -> 232.90s]  My stream is running.
[232.90s -> 236.26s]  We're ready to rock and roll whenever I am.
[236.38s -> 238.82s]  Can you guys hear me? Yep.
[238.82s -> 243.12s]  All right. I'm back. Hello.
[243.12s -> 244.84s]  If I show the screen, there's nothing on the screen
[244.84s -> 247.84s]  that's not going to like leak the game code or anything, right?
[249.74s -> 251.50s]  No, it's hidden up top, right?
[251.50s -> 252.78s]  Well, cool. Yeah, game code.
[252.78s -> 255.10s]  They actually implemented that.
[255.10s -> 260.46s]  OK. So, yeah, once again, everybody, I have with me
[260.46s -> 269.31s]  Jerma Ross and Liam Triforce and also a basketball guest.
[269.47s -> 272.23s]  How do I walk a guest basketball jack-o-lanterns?
[272.31s -> 276.09s]  How do I leave this this board space?
[276.09s -> 278.70s]  I think. Oh, thank you.
[278.70s -> 280.06s]  All right. Yeah, there you go.
[280.06s -> 282.92s]  Who the hell is Jerma?
[282.92s -> 285.88s]  He's a famous streamer.
[285.88s -> 288.64s]  Now, now, now streamed to once or twice.
[289.97s -> 290.85s]  I watch now.
[290.85s -> 293.37s]  I mean, go watch my Anubis tutorial smite video.
[293.37s -> 295.43s]  That's what I'm known for.
[295.43s -> 296.82s]  That one.
[296.82s -> 298.74s]  All right. I got to make it so it's not pushed to talk
[298.74s -> 300.82s]  because I'm going to I'm going to scream something at you guys
[300.82s -> 302.61s]  and you're just not going to hear it.
[302.61s -> 308.10s]  OK. Just for the record, everyone watching, Liam and I are in VR.
[308.46s -> 310.82s]  Ross and Jerma are on desktop.
[310.82s -> 312.86s]  Yeah. Our experiences will be different.
[312.86s -> 315.57s]  If you want to watch Jerma's perspective,
[315.57s -> 317.69s]  you can go to his channel as well.
[317.69s -> 319.17s]  I can't tell which is which.
[319.17s -> 322.17s]  It's so funny hearing the different in each ear
[322.17s -> 327.36s]  because it's the positional audio that's funny.
[327.36s -> 330.77s]  Throw a football.
[330.81s -> 331.93s]  All right. Is this is this better?
[331.93s -> 334.53s]  Can you guys hear me?
[334.53s -> 336.13s]  Yeah, it's a good Halloween game.
[336.13s -> 339.17s]  Oh, well, you can keep the basketball on you if you need it.
[340.68s -> 342.36s]  Like I just have it on my belt now.
[342.36s -> 344.36s]  Save it for later. Throw it at the ghost.
[344.36s -> 348.00s]  How do I turn some people saying that everyone were all loud, apparently?
[349.38s -> 350.38s]  Loud.
[350.38s -> 351.58s]  Is it was at the menu screen?
[351.58s -> 355.95s]  Is there a way I can drop people's levels in here, a tab or something?
[357.66s -> 359.58s]  The menu screen here, you can turn it.
[359.58s -> 361.62s]  Oh, right. OK, right, right, right.
[361.62s -> 364.59s]  Oh, OK.
[364.59s -> 366.23s]  Chad, everyone's good on my end, right?
[366.23s -> 369.35s]  Like they sound like human, like human with good volume.
[369.95s -> 371.87s]  I think that's probably a little better.
[371.87s -> 374.63s]  How's my volume? I'm OK. Yeah, everyone's good.
[374.67s -> 377.95s]  I think everybody sounds all right now.
[377.95s -> 380.03s]  But yeah, they did a pretty good job with the lobby.
[380.03s -> 381.79s]  You can see the spooky bats up there.
[381.79s -> 384.28s]  There's jack-o'-lanterns. There's done.
[384.28s -> 386.24s]  I just left the fucking game.
[390.75s -> 392.83s]  Fuck. OK, hold on.
[393.23s -> 396.03s]  I I thought it was like a leave.
[396.03s -> 397.71s]  They're going to be pissed. Hold on.
[397.71s -> 408.25s]  Give. We're about to start to.
[410.15s -> 411.55s]  OK, join game.
[411.55s -> 421.76s]  I don't want to show this or walk over and like place it in.
[421.80s -> 424.04s]  OK, so leave is not leave is OK.
[427.18s -> 429.02s]  Hey, I'll be the judge of that.
[429.02s -> 431.98s]  I'll have to. I'll be on the corn hall committee.
[432.58s -> 435.42s]  I accidentally press leave game instead of leave the menu.
[436.69s -> 439.70s]  I would love to hear a committee.
[439.70s -> 440.90s]  All right. So this game is pretty dark.
[440.90s -> 442.50s]  I don't know where we're going. How do we get out of here?
[442.50s -> 444.98s]  Oh, my Jesus Christ. That was scary.
[445.54s -> 447.22s]  I didn't even see that.
[447.22s -> 450.26s]  If Chris Martin from Coldplay shocked you on some steps,
[450.26s -> 451.86s]  I'd be scared, too. Yes.
[451.86s -> 453.74s]  You know, I can barely see. Is there like a brightness?
[453.74s -> 456.90s]  I do. There are lights on in this room and I can't see anybody.
[457.75s -> 459.31s]  It's so dark.
[459.31s -> 460.27s]  Yeah, it's really dark.
[460.27s -> 463.11s]  Flashlight, I think that we can use it is
[464.39s -> 467.70s]  tea tea.
[467.70s -> 471.26s]  Let's try that. That's so much better.
[471.26s -> 474.04s]  I just went into brightness and just turned it up.
[474.04s -> 475.68s]  OK, I might do that.
[475.68s -> 479.46s]  I'll do. So, Chad, it's been like,
[479.78s -> 483.18s]  I guess over a year since I've played this, so it's been updated quite a bit.
[483.18s -> 485.76s]  There's like a there's like a mental asylum.
[485.76s -> 487.24s]  Like, Liam, you played this a lot.
[487.24s -> 489.44s]  Do you know how to, like, go to the asylum?
[490.17s -> 493.01s]  Yeah. When you select a mission, you'll be able to pick the asylum.
[493.77s -> 497.17s]  As long as it's available, I'm pretty sure it says it's locked.
[497.93s -> 500.65s]  Oh, damn. I guess we got to play the other missions then.
[501.21s -> 505.25s]  Would you be able to make a map like a server and like select it?
[505.89s -> 508.90s]  Or is it just because we're all underleveled?
[509.50s -> 511.22s]  Yeah, we're all pretty good, like zero.
[511.22s -> 513.74s]  I probably don't have it whenever I have levels.
[513.74s -> 516.66s]  I just piggyback off of my friends to get the new levels
[516.78s -> 518.74s]  because they'd always be like sitting here or something.
[520.06s -> 522.54s]  Um, well, we could go to the farmhouse.
[522.54s -> 524.38s]  I don't think we've seen this one.
[524.38s -> 526.66s]  I have no info. I don't know where anybody is.
[527.46s -> 529.30s]  Oh, wait. Yeah.
[529.30s -> 531.38s]  Oh, hang on. Let me see if I can find the asylum.
[531.38s -> 533.38s]  I think I can pick it.
[533.38s -> 534.78s]  Oh, really? What's it called?
[534.78s -> 537.46s]  Sunny Meadows?
[537.46s -> 541.18s]  Maybe we don't want to start at the asylum anyway, because we're all rotten at this.
[541.58s -> 543.26s]  Yeah. So we'll figure that out.
[543.26s -> 547.34s]  Let's try this Bleasdale farmhouse and we'll bust some ghosts.
[547.86s -> 551.42s]  Yeah. OK. I think, yeah, we can vote for the asylum whenever we're ready.
[551.98s -> 554.68s]  Oh, OK. So ready up. Ready up.
[555.32s -> 556.76s]  OK. And what about equipment?
[556.76s -> 558.28s]  Do we want to bring equipment?
[558.28s -> 561.32s]  Yeah, we don't have a crucifix candle,
[562.20s -> 564.58s]  motion sensor, salt, sanity pills.
[564.58s -> 566.62s]  We're going to need those. I'm going to bring a lighter.
[567.54s -> 570.74s]  OK. Why are you guys all like hunched over?
[574.96s -> 576.87s]  I don't know. I'm not hunched over.
[576.87s -> 578.91s]  No, this is just my normal posture.
[578.91s -> 582.31s]  Oh, well, everybody's everybody's leaning forward.
[582.35s -> 586.08s]  I'm an osteoporobro. Oh, my God.
[588.85s -> 593.05s]  We got some stuff like the way you guys were standing is the way that I guarantee
[593.05s -> 596.33s]  a side profile candid picture of me sitting on the couch with a remote control.
[596.33s -> 599.17s]  The TV is that's exactly what it looks like.
[599.17s -> 602.42s]  It's like that. Like, yeah.
[602.42s -> 606.42s]  Yeah, this that that is the exact pose, like the neck forward shoulders rolled.
[606.74s -> 611.88s]  All right, everyone, I think we're ready to bust some ghosts.
[612.36s -> 615.04s]  All right. You guys are going to have to hard carry.
[615.04s -> 617.40s]  I have no idea what the fuck's going on.
[618.97s -> 621.73s]  And we don't get Ghostbusters equipment like that last game we played.
[621.93s -> 623.93s]  Oh, no. We only play games together.
[623.93s -> 626.85s]  Jerma and I in particular, if it's ghost busting related.
[626.89s -> 629.50s]  I know it has to be ghost related.
[629.50s -> 634.14s]  It just started happening this way.
[634.14s -> 636.26s]  OK. Oh, yeah. We don't have any sanity pills.
[636.26s -> 638.78s]  We might need those. Oh, yeah.
[639.75s -> 641.87s]  Oh, am I not ready? Vdub left some at my house.
[641.87s -> 643.35s]  Hang on. Yeah.
[643.35s -> 644.63s]  Oh, there we go.
[644.63s -> 647.19s]  No, now you're unready school.
[647.19s -> 648.19s]  Yeah, you double click.
[648.19s -> 650.47s]  I got confused. All right.
[651.03s -> 652.99s]  We got some sanity pills now.
[652.99s -> 655.54s]  OK, we have at least one.
[655.54s -> 661.85s]  Oh, we're going. Oh, OK.
[666.53s -> 670.01s]  Guys, there's a skeleton in here already.
[671.29s -> 674.96s]  Hey, let me investigate.
[674.96s -> 678.58s]  Oh, yeah. There's a little bit of meat on the bone if anyone's hungry.
[679.34s -> 683.92s]  Gross. No, I'm not.
[683.92s -> 685.44s]  I'm not wearing a Halloween mask.
[685.44s -> 687.16s]  Stop fucking saying it.
[687.16s -> 689.82s]  I put it in the title.
[690.42s -> 691.46s]  People keep asking me this.
[691.46s -> 693.14s]  It's like just getting annoying.
[693.14s -> 695.30s]  Like, dude, why do you have a Halloween mask on?
[695.30s -> 699.04s]  No. Look, whatever.
[702.48s -> 705.08s]  Trying to. Why am I already at 99 percent sanity?
[705.08s -> 707.08s]  Ninety eight percent. What?
[707.08s -> 709.92s]  Oh, I just. Oh, I looked at the skeleton.
[709.92s -> 711.28s]  Oh, yeah, that must be it.
[711.28s -> 714.84s]  All right. So we tell the ghost with a smudge stick while it's chasing someone.
[715.20s -> 717.16s]  Well, I hope we have a smudge stick. Hold on.
[718.34s -> 720.38s]  Um, it changed a lot of stuff.
[720.38s -> 725.22s]  We've got a lightsaber, a camera.
[725.22s -> 727.72s]  How do you open the inventory?
[729.54s -> 731.94s]  Well, there's the book on your your belt.
[731.94s -> 733.90s]  You can open to see your items.
[735.98s -> 737.90s]  You got a big hand.
[737.90s -> 739.66s]  How do I pick up a flashlight?
[739.66s -> 741.72s]  Oh, there we go.
[741.72s -> 745.48s]  So, hey, Liam, do you remember how to do radio communication?
[746.52s -> 747.96s]  I think it should be your shoulder.
[747.96s -> 750.36s]  Oh, wait, there's a radio now for an update.
[750.36s -> 751.72s]  They added a little radio.
[751.72s -> 755.34s]  And if you hold it, you talk over the comms. Oh.
[756.18s -> 761.62s]  Try to take the camera.
[761.62s -> 764.25s]  Oh, how do you how do you do that?
[764.25s -> 768.25s]  On the utility belt, you take out the little walkie talkie
[768.25s -> 770.53s]  and just hold whatever button it's mapped to.
[770.53s -> 772.37s]  I don't know on keyboard.
[776.74s -> 781.04s]  V. Is it V?
[781.04s -> 788.44s]  Hello. Hello. How do I open the belt?
[793.58s -> 799.01s]  Utility belt to the belt is trying some buttons right now.
[800.30s -> 804.26s]  Oh, OK. If we're going to do this, we need smudge sticks.
[804.26s -> 805.26s]  And I don't think we have any.
[805.26s -> 807.74s]  So we're just going to have to try and identify the ghost
[807.74s -> 809.54s]  based on what we can see.
[809.54s -> 812.18s]  OK. And then head on out.
[813.70s -> 815.62s]  Yeah. All right. All right. All right.
[815.62s -> 817.90s]  OK. Well, it's not being a pressure.
[820.94s -> 822.18s]  OK. OK.
[822.18s -> 835.80s]  Like, if I just use the flashlight, wouldn't it?
[835.88s -> 840.20s]  Hold B. I'm holding B. It's not doing it.
[840.20s -> 841.80s]  OK. How do I access the belt?
[841.80s -> 844.64s]  Did we bring did we bring an EMF detector?
[846.00s -> 849.51s]  That's Spirit Box.
[849.51s -> 850.35s]  Oh, boy.
[853.30s -> 855.38s]  We did bring a camera. That's good.
[856.58s -> 859.10s]  So we can set that up somewhere and look for ghost orbs
[859.10s -> 860.46s]  where the thing may be.
[860.46s -> 864.10s]  But if we don't have an EMF, that might be tricky.
[865.57s -> 867.37s]  I got the camera right here.
[867.37s -> 870.49s]  You take pictures and the ghost shows up by the thing you scream, right?
[872.68s -> 873.80s]  Yeah. OK.
[873.80s -> 889.69s]  I'll burn her up.
[901.77s -> 902.97s]  It's really windy.
[902.97s -> 903.97s]  It's Vinnie.
[903.97s -> 908.58s]  It sounds like you're like in a call with me, like on my desk speaker.
[909.85s -> 911.73s]  Like, oh, man, we couldn't get Discord to work.
[911.73s -> 912.57s]  It's all right, Vinnie.
[912.57s -> 915.29s]  You can come through like on my on my my iPhone or the speaker.
[919.58s -> 926.67s]  Oh, piano. Let's play it. OK.
[926.67s -> 928.71s]  Jesus, what the fuck?
[928.71s -> 930.35s]  That was you did that, right?
[930.35s -> 935.62s]  Wait, was a ghost doing that? OK.
[939.17s -> 941.17s]  Well, you guys got to play something.
[941.17s -> 942.17s]  Oh, wow.
[946.54s -> 949.46s]  Oh, that's sad. I wish I could do that.
[949.46s -> 951.98s]  Wait, can I?
[956.15s -> 958.35s]  Wait, we just tap it when we're down.
[962.10s -> 966.86s]  Oh, oh, gosh, you have to deal with whatever song the game gives you.
[969.85s -> 972.13s]  Boy, I left the camera here.
[972.13s -> 973.05s]  All right. Who's going to work?
[973.05s -> 976.66s]  Who's coming upstairs with me?
[976.66s -> 979.30s]  Where we off to? Where we going?
[979.30s -> 980.22s]  We can hit the attic.
[980.22s -> 983.38s]  See if there's a check the attic.
[983.38s -> 985.70s]  Any spooky phenomenon?
[987.09s -> 988.65s]  We are doing this so wrong, man.
[988.65s -> 991.75s]  Like I should be all the way back.
[991.75s -> 993.07s]  I should be like key light.
[993.07s -> 996.40s]  You should be focused light. You know what I mean?
[996.40s -> 1003.73s]  I don't like this.
[1003.73s -> 1006.34s]  Oh, I just love. OK, you are.
[1006.34s -> 1008.66s]  OK, I found a brush.
[1011.56s -> 1013.16s]  Does that matter?
[1013.16s -> 1017.36s]  I don't I don't think so.
[1017.36s -> 1019.92s]  We do have like a book we could put down.
[1019.92s -> 1021.76s]  Oh, I could take a picture.
[1021.76s -> 1023.52s]  Right. I do have a book.
[1023.52s -> 1024.96s]  We should put it right here. OK.
[1024.96s -> 1027.84s]  Yeah. Put it there and see if the demon like writes in it.
[1027.84s -> 1030.64s]  OK. Then we can point a camera at it.
[1030.64s -> 1031.92s]  Do we need to open it?
[1031.92s -> 1034.38s]  I don't know. I got a camera here. Oops.
[1034.38s -> 1041.30s]  Oh, I really have no idea.
[1041.30s -> 1044.80s]  We're just like, I'm just making this up as I go along.
[1044.80s -> 1047.47s]  All right. Hold on. Take it.
[1047.47s -> 1048.43s]  OK. Beautiful.
[1048.43s -> 1050.43s]  How many photos can you take?
[1050.43s -> 1052.15s]  Get my good side.
[1052.15s -> 1055.03s]  No, you didn't.
[1055.03s -> 1056.99s]  How do I press? Oh, OK.
[1056.99s -> 1059.39s]  There we go. OK. I put the put it down.
[1059.39s -> 1062.83s]  It's open on the on the table.
[1062.83s -> 1064.83s]  All right. Now we've got to wait for it to.
[1064.83s -> 1066.75s]  Maybe it'll write on it, I guess.
[1066.75s -> 1069.67s]  We can come check on it later and just go downstairs.
[1069.67s -> 1071.65s]  Yeah, that works.
[1071.65s -> 1074.44s]  Doesn't this game listen to your microphone, too?
[1074.44s -> 1078.48s]  Yeah. If you like, learn its name and say, suck my balls, suck my balls.
[1079.68s -> 1085.18s]  Oh, OK. Oh, hey, what's up, man?
[1085.18s -> 1087.58s]  Hey, did you know?
[1087.58s -> 1091.87s]  Wait, you have a camcorder?
[1091.87s -> 1097.13s]  Yeah. The lens cap is on.
[1100.83s -> 1111.37s]  All right. So I was that somebody was a shadow.
[1111.37s -> 1122.78s]  I don't know. OK.
[1122.78s -> 1123.86s]  Something just flew. Something just flew by.
[1123.86s -> 1125.29s]  Something just flew by me.
[1125.29s -> 1128.57s]  Well, I saw something like a book just flew from right to left.
[1128.57s -> 1132.26s]  I swear. Oh, well, you think it was the book you left upstairs?
[1132.26s -> 1134.66s]  I don't know.
[1134.66s -> 1142.76s]  Lame. Oh, I'm getting chills.
[1142.76s -> 1145.36s]  Wait, where is he? Is he is he is he at like 7-Eleven?
[1145.88s -> 1146.76s]  Hey, can you stop?
[1146.76s -> 1148.56s]  Can you grab me some flaming hot Cheetos, dude?
[1148.56s -> 1150.46s]  Like on your way back?
[1150.46s -> 1152.12s]  You gave me flaming hot.
[1152.12s -> 1155.30s]  I want the powdered doughnuts.
[1155.30s -> 1156.58s]  Get the new lime ones, though.
[1156.58s -> 1166.69s]  Those things are fucking sick.
[1166.69s -> 1168.57s]  They actually are actually sick.
[1168.57s -> 1170.57s]  The new lime flaming hot Cheetos are awesome.
[1174.38s -> 1180.06s]  All right. Let's check the book.
[1180.06s -> 1183.44s]  Where's the book over here?
[1183.44s -> 1186.83s]  Not that I can tell.
[1186.83s -> 1187.79s]  It would be pretty obvious.
[1187.79s -> 1189.51s]  It draws like pentagrams and shit.
[1189.51s -> 1191.82s]  Maybe not up here, then.
[1191.82s -> 1194.34s]  Huh? Going to bring it with you?
[1194.34s -> 1195.90s]  Oh, yeah. Maybe we'll put it somewhere else.
[1195.90s -> 1199.54s]  Maybe because it would have probably done it by now, right?
[1199.54s -> 1204.59s]  I imagine you maybe put it down.
[1204.59s -> 1209.36s]  Hey, what's up?
[1209.36s -> 1212.08s]  All right. I'm putting it over here.
[1212.08s -> 1214.28s]  Yeah, maybe.
[1214.28s -> 1216.20s]  What's the scariest place in this whole house?
[1216.20s -> 1222.14s]  I would have said the attic, but I guess, yeah, we could do downstairs.
[1224.78s -> 1227.12s]  Piano's pretty scary.
[1227.92s -> 1230.76s]  OK, yeah, my light just like somebody's singing.
[1232.36s -> 1234.20s]  OK, yeah, I don't like this at all.
[1234.20s -> 1236.72s]  OK, they're coming from that room in there on the left.
[1237.98s -> 1239.62s]  I heard that door.
[1239.62s -> 1240.86s]  I got a frag grenade going out.
[1240.86s -> 1243.82s]  I guess somebody's right here.
[1243.82s -> 1245.58s]  Yeah, there's a ghost.
[1245.58s -> 1247.78s]  What? Excuse me?
[1247.78s -> 1248.94s]  They're strangling Vinny.
[1248.94s -> 1251.34s]  What? What just happened?
[1252.10s -> 1254.14s]  I killed Vinny.
[1254.14s -> 1256.62s]  OK, we're probably going to die next.
[1257.06s -> 1257.98s]  What do you think?
[1257.98s -> 1260.46s]  Um, I'm going to put the book down on the ground
[1261.43s -> 1264.11s]  and then we're going to see almost like a landmine.
[1265.14s -> 1267.34s]  Yeah, it'll get distracted and draw pictures.
[1267.34s -> 1269.34s]  It'll draw a picture to be like, oh, I have to do this.
[1269.34s -> 1271.38s]  I'm a fucking ghost. I have to draw a pentagram.
[1271.38s -> 1283.66s]  Right. That's what's going to happen.
[1283.66s -> 1285.26s]  So what even was that?
[1285.26s -> 1287.50s]  Yeah, I don't actually know how to open doors and decks.
[1287.50s -> 1289.06s]  Desktop. Do you know how to do that?
[1289.42s -> 1290.90s]  This is the second time I've ever played this game.
[1290.90s -> 1291.98s]  So no, I don't either.
[1291.98s -> 1293.90s]  So we're trapped in here.
[1293.90s -> 1296.18s]  All right. So we need to figure out how to open a door,
[1296.62s -> 1299.86s]  which is probably E, which is probably click.
[1299.86s -> 1302.50s]  It's click. Oh, it's left click.
[1303.14s -> 1305.89s]  Oh, this toilet's nasty, dude.
[1305.89s -> 1314.12s]  Let me see. Oh, are we the only two people left?
[1315.78s -> 1317.30s]  I think so. Oh, wait.
[1317.30s -> 1320.84s]  We are. When did, um, who?
[1321.32s -> 1324.72s]  Yeah. When? When did that happen?
[1324.72s -> 1325.76s]  This ghost is aggressive.
[1325.76s -> 1327.72s]  Should we just leave and just go?
[1327.72s -> 1328.92s]  Yeah, I know. Close that door.
[1328.92s -> 1331.40s]  You scared you. Oh, God.
[1331.40s -> 1333.56s]  You scared me just then because you walked through me.
[1333.56s -> 1335.08s]  I saw your teeth.
[1335.08s -> 1337.16s]  It's already singing right now.
[1337.16s -> 1339.70s]  Oh, for fuck, dude.
[1339.70s -> 1340.86s]  I feel like we're playing Left 4 Dead.
[1340.86s -> 1342.42s]  And like this is the oh, the good idea.
[1342.42s -> 1344.66s]  Let's go in the bathroom and aim our shotguns out the door.
[1344.94s -> 1346.74s]  It never works. It always feels like it should, though.
[1346.74s -> 1352.05s]  I'm not scared, by the way, just so you know.
[1353.03s -> 1356.15s]  I'm going to hide it. OK, I'm going to crouch.
[1356.15s -> 1360.40s]  I'm going to also crouch.
[1360.40s -> 1362.40s]  I think it's out there.
[1362.40s -> 1367.30s]  Do we want to go try to get back to the trailer and see if we can guess?
[1367.38s -> 1369.70s]  I think well, we know it's the singing one.
[1370.23s -> 1371.79s]  What does that matter?
[1371.79s -> 1374.11s]  That's all the like the information I made.
[1374.39s -> 1375.87s]  Are we locked in here?
[1375.87s -> 1378.79s]  I do. We actually did that.
[1378.79s -> 1379.63s]  You're joking.
[1381.19s -> 1383.23s]  Can we actually knock it out of here?
[1383.23s -> 1386.32s]  I'll try the window.
[1386.32s -> 1388.09s]  The window doesn't work.
[1388.09s -> 1393.04s]  What did you do with that?
[1393.04s -> 1394.20s]  No, I just tried to open it.
[1394.20s -> 1398.14s]  Wait, you let the ghost in, didn't you?
[1398.62s -> 1399.90s]  I might have. I don't know.
[1399.90s -> 1401.97s]  It's possible.
[1401.97s -> 1403.61s]  I'm sweating. I'm sweating.
[1403.61s -> 1408.14s]  I mean, no, I'm not. I'm brave. Let's go.
[1408.14s -> 1410.74s]  Let's just leave. This place is bad.
[1411.18s -> 1413.42s]  Oh, wait, hold on. Actually, let's check the book.
[1413.42s -> 1415.71s]  Wait, the book actually might have something in it.
[1415.71s -> 1417.87s]  No, it's got nothing. Oh, come on. Really?
[1418.93s -> 1421.16s]  Yeah. Oh, well.
[1421.16s -> 1422.72s]  OK, let's try to guess.
[1422.72s -> 1424.65s]  This is a warm up around anyways.
[1424.65s -> 1427.98s]  It's the the the the singing
[1429.74s -> 1431.70s]  singing specter.
[1432.38s -> 1434.18s]  OK, yeah, they're down here.
[1434.18s -> 1437.69s]  They can't get up there.
[1437.69s -> 1439.09s]  Yeah, you're in.
[1439.09s -> 1440.89s]  Um, I think they're I don't know.
[1440.89s -> 1441.93s]  It got me. It got me.
[1441.93s -> 1444.18s]  It got you. It did.
[1457.23s -> 1458.19s]  Give me stuff.
[1458.19s -> 1463.96s]  Do you have any items?
[1463.96s -> 1475.30s]  Hey, this is why is this locked?
[1475.30s -> 1477.10s]  I'm getting the fuck out of this house.
[1477.10s -> 1479.46s]  I'm the one that got to stay alive.
[1482.27s -> 1487.23s]  And by the way, you're the singing specter with the car.
[1495.00s -> 1496.92s]  All right. It's the singing.
[1496.92s -> 1498.33s]  All right.
[1499.33s -> 1503.82s]  She's choking people.
[1503.82s -> 1507.70s]  All right. I think I got it.
[1507.70s -> 1509.50s]  How do I how do I guess?
[1509.50s -> 1520.28s]  How do I how do I guess?
[1520.28s -> 1522.60s]  It's open your journal. OK.
[1522.60s -> 1526.14s]  Um, ghosts, it's the.
[1526.14s -> 1528.91s]  Oh, my God, there's so many.
[1528.91s -> 1534.72s]  What's the one that sings?
[1534.72s -> 1538.43s]  They're probably just like, dude, just just just fucking just get out of the game.
[1538.43s -> 1540.26s]  Go to evidence.
[1540.26s -> 1542.77s]  OK, all right, right, right.
[1542.77s -> 1550.30s]  The ghost, I believe, is a we heard singing.
[1551.32s -> 1553.67s]  It was very cold.
[1553.67s -> 1558.98s]  There was a music.
[1560.22s -> 1561.18s]  I think it was a bay.
[1561.18s -> 1568.59s]  No, I'm going to say it's just a gym.
[1570.22s -> 1573.38s]  I'm going to say demon and that's it.
[1573.62s -> 1575.82s]  Right. A demon.
[1575.82s -> 1577.94s]  I don't know, guys, I don't know how any of this works.
[1577.94s -> 1582.50s]  I'm going to say demon and and just call it.
[1583.86s -> 1593.61s]  How do I how do I say yes?
[1593.61s -> 1596.28s]  Go to the truck door. OK.
[1606.39s -> 1612.52s]  We do it.
[1612.52s -> 1613.98s]  Oh, did we win?
[1613.98s -> 1615.18s]  It was a revenant.
[1615.18s -> 1617.58s]  It was what you what you guess.
[1617.58s -> 1619.98s]  I guess demon.
[1619.98s -> 1621.78s]  OK, German, can you hear me? Revenant.
[1621.78s -> 1625.96s]  Yeah. German, apparently you couldn't hear me in game because my
[1626.48s -> 1628.62s]  like you had me too low.
[1628.62s -> 1631.34s]  I did. I was talking, but people were saying I wasn't audible.
[1631.42s -> 1633.14s]  But they're OK.
[1633.14s -> 1635.94s]  You were coming through the walkie talkie for a little while.
[1638.00s -> 1639.28s]  I think it was a glitch.
[1639.28s -> 1641.69s]  I don't know. I can hear you now.
[1641.69s -> 1643.21s]  We're yeah, I think it's a glitch now.
[1643.21s -> 1645.53s]  Also, Liam got booted before we started.
[1645.53s -> 1648.21s]  So the one dude knew how to play the game was booted.
[1648.29s -> 1650.09s]  That's so funny.
[1651.02s -> 1652.46s]  We were trying to figure out my book.
[1652.46s -> 1654.22s]  Oh, by the way, I'm back now. Finally.
[1654.22s -> 1657.26s]  I. OK, I opened my book.
[1657.26s -> 1659.62s]  I was looking at the evidence and my game just kicked me to the main menu
[1659.62s -> 1661.16s]  for no reason.
[1661.16s -> 1663.60s]  I guess it was a connection, according to Vinnie's chat.
[1663.60s -> 1666.80s]  But I have been cool.
[1666.80s -> 1669.24s]  I'm surprised at least one of us made it out of there.
[1670.27s -> 1672.79s]  I don't know how.
[1673.90s -> 1677.74s]  I'm going to add all like as much equipment as I can get.
[1678.50s -> 1681.82s]  OK, so we have we're just going to all walk behind you saved up.
[1682.72s -> 1685.88s]  Yeah, I'm trying to navigate this new menu, though.
[1685.88s -> 1686.72s]  I'm not used to it.
[1686.72s -> 1689.76s]  I'm telling you, we should just there should be three people with flashlights
[1689.76s -> 1693.48s]  in a triangle pattern, all pointing in the direction that he is facing.
[1694.70s -> 1696.46s]  Yeah, we should.
[1696.46s -> 1699.58s]  We should just be your studio lighting for you to go around and find stuff.
[1700.46s -> 1703.94s]  OK, candle by that.
[1704.42s -> 1706.99s]  Let me just get set up real quick.
[1706.99s -> 1708.75s]  I do the same level.
[1708.75s -> 1711.34s]  Yeah, I'm going to add a lighter.
[1711.42s -> 1713.82s]  Just going to just keep adding lighters.
[1714.18s -> 1715.50s]  OK, we got two.
[1715.50s -> 1716.38s]  So we're good.
[1716.38s -> 1720.32s]  Motion sensor, hairball, microphone.
[1720.36s -> 1721.00s]  What's all this stuff?
[1721.00s -> 1723.54s]  I get some there's some jiggling happening.
[1723.54s -> 1724.74s]  That's the stuff we're buying right now.
[1724.74s -> 1727.17s]  Somebody said gamer neck.
[1727.17s -> 1731.97s]  Hmm. So Vinnie, how are you using the walkie talkie?
[1732.49s -> 1733.97s]  What is it?
[1733.97s -> 1735.69s]  Are you holding what you did?
[1735.69s -> 1737.97s]  You have to physically pick up the walkie talkie to talk into it.
[1738.75s -> 1740.55s]  Yeah. Oh, like this.
[1740.55s -> 1743.35s]  And then I have to do this because I would do.
[1743.35s -> 1746.63s]  Do we how do we have those as non VR?
[1746.67s -> 1748.11s]  Yeah, yeah, we do.
[1748.11s -> 1752.83s]  I think you hit Q or maybe we have to hit B or V because I was hitting B or V
[1752.83s -> 1755.71s]  and it was making like a noise, you know, noise maybe.
[1756.43s -> 1757.59s]  So it's just we have to.
[1757.59s -> 1760.07s]  Oh, I thought that holding B was voice chat.
[1760.82s -> 1763.92s]  But OK, I get it.
[1763.92s -> 1768.62s]  I get it. Green on one side, red on the other.
[1769.10s -> 1772.62s]  That's like you got to do RGB lighting if you if you're like an epic
[1772.86s -> 1775.18s]  Call of Duty gamer on YouTube.
[1775.18s -> 1776.26s]  OK, there we go.
[1776.26s -> 1778.42s]  OK, so now you're lit properly.
[1778.42s -> 1780.62s]  Speaking of light, do we need any more lighters?
[1781.58s -> 1783.78s]  I'm getting as much equipment as I possibly can.
[1783.78s -> 1786.02s]  We're if we're using smudge sticks, we're probably going to need
[1786.02s -> 1788.28s]  at least one per person.
[1788.28s -> 1789.96s]  OK. OK. Yeah.
[1789.96s -> 1794.08s]  I VDub left a couple smudge sticks here last night, so I'm I'm down for that.
[1796.04s -> 1797.48s]  Wait, candle.
[1798.28s -> 1801.67s]  How much money do I have?
[1801.67s -> 1804.83s]  Um, you can see it over here on this monitor.
[1804.83s -> 1806.63s]  You can see it in the top right.
[1806.63s -> 1807.59s]  How much money you have?
[1807.59s -> 1808.63s]  Oh, I got 25 bucks.
[1808.63s -> 1810.27s]  Do I get a lighter?
[1810.27s -> 1812.27s]  I'll get a
[1814.23s -> 1816.21s]  can of whipped cream.
[1816.21s -> 1817.49s]  Yeah, there's is that whipped cream?
[1817.49s -> 1819.61s]  Is that whip? It's I don't know.
[1819.61s -> 1821.77s]  I don't have it's ghost assault.
[1821.77s -> 1822.81s]  Hey, it's OK.
[1822.81s -> 1825.45s]  Guys, I brought two lighters motion sensor.
[1825.45s -> 1828.29s]  OK, there we go.
[1828.29s -> 1833.77s]  We are now all around to to to detect when ghosts like are near us.
[1833.77s -> 1835.13s]  You have one of those.
[1835.13s -> 1838.17s]  Yeah, math. Yeah, we've added one.
[1838.69s -> 1841.94s]  OK, that's good.
[1841.94s -> 1846.46s]  We add another.
[1846.46s -> 1849.50s]  I think with what we have, we'll be all right.
[1849.50s -> 1850.14s]  We've got everything.
[1850.14s -> 1853.62s]  I'm voting for 10 Ridgeview Court, so sure.
[1854.18s -> 1855.99s]  We're writing up.
[1855.99s -> 1861.18s]  Sure. Sick.
[1861.18s -> 1863.66s]  All right. Hopefully I don't disconnect this time.
[1863.66s -> 1865.34s]  We definitely need we definitely need you.
[1865.34s -> 1866.50s]  We need your expertise.
[1866.50s -> 1873.22s]  Amen has money.
[1873.22s -> 1874.34s]  We're all here.
[1874.34s -> 1877.01s]  We're all here.
[1877.01s -> 1877.89s]  Perfect.
[1877.89s -> 1880.77s]  Oh, I really, really hope I don't get disconnected this time.
[1882.33s -> 1884.34s]  And if I do, good luck.
[1884.34s -> 1886.98s]  Is this wacky device?
[1887.74s -> 1891.58s]  Well, I think that's all the whipped cream sound.
[1891.86s -> 1894.17s]  Yeah, I think it's a parabolic microphone.
[1894.17s -> 1900.73s]  Ah, hey, hey, guys.
[1904.27s -> 1906.56s]  Oh, I love whipped cream.
[1906.56s -> 1907.80s]  That joke was awful.
[1907.80s -> 1909.56s]  That was not even funny.
[1910.76s -> 1915.58s]  I don't have it today.
[1915.58s -> 1918.10s]  If I ever had it, I certainly don't have it today either.
[1918.70s -> 1920.62s]  I just I just we have to understand something.
[1920.62s -> 1923.22s]  I just did the look at I'm turning the thing upside down
[1923.22s -> 1925.42s]  and eating it at like three o'clock in the morning out of the fridge.
[1926.59s -> 1927.55s]  That was the humor there.
[1927.55s -> 1929.87s]  Oh, OK, that's cool.
[1929.99s -> 1932.71s]  OK, so we should probably spread our equipment
[1932.71s -> 1934.19s]  thin here based on what we have.
[1934.19s -> 1938.23s]  Like, no, we shouldn't have like four EMFs like divided between us.
[1938.23s -> 1939.71s]  We only need like three.
[1941.13s -> 1942.93s]  We need to get the ghost to blow out a candle,
[1942.93s -> 1944.93s]  prevent the ghost from hunting with a crucifix
[1944.93s -> 1947.85s]  and clear the area near the ghost using smudge sticks.
[1947.85s -> 1950.93s]  So I'll bring the crucifix of just a crease through.
[1950.93s -> 1952.17s]  I just played faith.
[1952.17s -> 1953.77s]  So I know how to do this.
[1953.77s -> 1955.74s]  You just hold it up, is that?
[1955.74s -> 1959.05s]  Yeah, basically, if it's hacking, you just like do this.
[1959.09s -> 1960.61s]  Yeah. The power of Christ compelled.
[1960.61s -> 1964.23s]  OK, exactly. I think so.
[1964.67s -> 1966.03s]  It is actually prayer.
[1966.03s -> 1968.75s]  I mean, like I've never it's it's 50 50.
[1969.34s -> 1971.46s]  OK, so we don't have to actually recite the Lord.
[1971.46s -> 1973.90s]  Like when I went to school, they taught me our father.
[1974.26s -> 1977.45s]  Should I say that if that makes you more comfortable?
[1977.45s -> 1981.39s]  I think you should do it. All right.
[1981.39s -> 1984.15s]  All right. I'll set up a camera and tripod.
[1984.69s -> 1986.21s]  Yeah. Yeah, we should.
[1986.21s -> 1989.95s]  We actually should just take a bring a candle.
[1990.35s -> 1991.71s]  Oh, I need a lighter. Yeah.
[1991.75s -> 1993.95s]  How much can we bring in this new utility belt?
[1993.95s -> 1996.79s]  Like the area looks like three items, right?
[1998.20s -> 1999.92s]  Yeah, I've got pretty sure three.
[1999.92s -> 2005.02s]  Yeah, I have my flashlight and some think flashlights
[2005.02s -> 2007.42s]  probably really important.
[2007.42s -> 2008.50s]  Oh, you're going to need that.
[2008.50s -> 2010.64s]  You can do three.
[2010.64s -> 2012.00s]  I think it's three items.
[2012.00s -> 2013.56s]  You could. Yeah, on keyboard.
[2013.56s -> 2016.44s]  You're you don't have the hands, so they have to accommodate.
[2016.92s -> 2019.08s]  Oh, your mouse wheel to go between them.
[2019.83s -> 2023.42s]  OK. Oh, my God.
[2023.42s -> 2024.66s]  Is this going to be OK?
[2024.66s -> 2028.98s]  Why am I taking a lighter when I could take a flashlight?
[2028.98s -> 2031.26s]  That seems like you can probably.
[2031.26s -> 2034.30s]  The lighter is probably going to just be for the concert.
[2035.50s -> 2038.10s]  I'm definitely taking a flashlight these days.
[2038.89s -> 2043.45s]  So who you have crucifix who brought is anybody have smudge stick?
[2043.61s -> 2045.25s]  I have a I have a smudge stick.
[2045.25s -> 2048.33s]  German, if you have the lighter, definitely bring a smudge stick.
[2048.45s -> 2050.17s]  Oh, yeah, 100 percent. You're good.
[2050.17s -> 2054.37s]  OK. All right. So I should drop the lighter then and get something else.
[2055.01s -> 2057.85s]  I'll bring maybe bring bring the book or the blacklight.
[2058.41s -> 2062.33s]  So that way we can see if there's any like nocturnal emissions in the bedroom.
[2062.33s -> 2064.33s]  You guys you guys have EMFs, right?
[2064.49s -> 2065.69s]  Do I need this?
[2065.69s -> 2067.93s]  Uh, some ghostly goo.
[2067.93s -> 2069.97s]  I have flashlight, lighter and smudge stick.
[2070.70s -> 2072.82s]  Yeah. Did any I don't think anybody else has an EMF.
[2072.82s -> 2075.18s]  So take that. OK.
[2075.18s -> 2077.24s]  I'll take a spirit box.
[2077.24s -> 2081.73s]  And OK, my hands are full, but I mean,
[2083.06s -> 2085.82s]  you're walking in with like you can just juggle as you go.
[2086.18s -> 2087.38s]  Yeah, I think that's what I'm going to do.
[2087.38s -> 2091.42s]  You are right now the infomercial where it's trying to show you a product
[2091.42s -> 2093.86s]  that includes everything that's on your belt and holding it.
[2093.86s -> 2096.82s]  And you're like dropping shit in black and white. Yeah.
[2097.90s -> 2100.51s]  Like, why would you carry all this stuff?
[2100.51s -> 2105.11s]  Is this you can set that up here?
[2105.61s -> 2107.41s]  No, no, no. I just need to turn my flashlight.
[2107.41s -> 2109.13s]  We need to once we find the room, it's in.
[2109.13s -> 2110.05s]  Then we set it up.
[2110.05s -> 2111.37s]  Where is it snowing from?
[2111.37s -> 2112.81s]  Is this ghost snow?
[2112.81s -> 2115.01s]  Because it's like clear night and snow.
[2115.33s -> 2116.41s]  Maybe it's like ash.
[2116.41s -> 2119.25s]  The earth's like Silent Hill. Yeah. Yeah.
[2119.57s -> 2122.37s]  Like it's just coal fires burning under the town for 50 years.
[2122.37s -> 2126.02s]  That's that's earth door right now.
[2126.02s -> 2127.34s]  Shit, my flashlight.
[2127.34s -> 2130.42s]  That's not the moon. That's fucking earth.
[2130.98s -> 2133.12s]  Wait, wait, wait, what?
[2133.12s -> 2134.36s]  That looks like earth, man.
[2134.36s -> 2136.16s]  That doesn't look like the moon.
[2138.82s -> 2140.82s]  This shit's blue.
[2140.82s -> 2142.34s]  How did you bend that way?
[2142.34s -> 2143.82s]  Like broke your spine.
[2143.82s -> 2145.14s]  Oh, my goodness.
[2145.14s -> 2146.30s]  Permanent. Permanent.
[2146.30s -> 2147.62s]  OK, not having a flashlight kind of sucks.
[2147.62s -> 2149.98s]  Permanent spine damage.
[2149.98s -> 2151.44s]  All right.
[2151.44s -> 2153.52s]  All right. I hear something already.
[2153.52s -> 2154.76s]  That's the spirit box germ.
[2154.76s -> 2157.32s]  It's OK. OK, good.
[2159.16s -> 2162.32s]  OK, I've got the the camera set up over here
[2162.32s -> 2164.96s]  and I got the cross in case any demons wish to attempt.
[2165.12s -> 2167.36s]  All right. Should I light the smudge stick damage?
[2168.00s -> 2168.92s]  No, no, not yet.
[2168.92s -> 2170.68s]  We need to know where it is first.
[2170.68s -> 2172.36s]  OK, it's not in this room.
[2172.36s -> 2174.00s]  I'm not getting anything.
[2174.00s -> 2174.96s]  Give us a sign. I'll be right back.
[2174.96s -> 2176.52s]  I'm going to go get some more equipment.
[2176.52s -> 2178.52s]  Why would we be why are we doing this?
[2178.52s -> 2181.08s]  What is your name? Give us a sign.
[2182.08s -> 2185.68s]  Uh, let me go over here.
[2185.68s -> 2186.48s]  Well, I should probably now.
[2186.48s -> 2187.52s]  I'm not going to break up.
[2187.52s -> 2190.90s]  I'm going to stick here.
[2190.90s -> 2192.58s]  Where's Vinnie going?
[2192.58s -> 2195.90s]  Uh, probably to get get an item.
[2195.90s -> 2196.74s]  Vinnie, where are you at?
[2196.74s -> 2201.59s]  OK. Vinnie, you good?
[2201.59s -> 2203.91s]  No, I'm fine. I'm just grabbing some Crystal Head vodka.
[2204.63s -> 2215.36s]  Oh, we thought you were dead.
[2215.36s -> 2217.24s]  Oh, oh, OK, cool, cool, cool.
[2217.24s -> 2219.24s]  30 seconds before a ghost appears.
[2219.24s -> 2221.12s]  That's what it says here on the time.
[2221.12s -> 2223.52s]  Oh, let's we should put something down then.
[2224.42s -> 2226.26s]  Yeah, I've got the book.
[2226.26s -> 2228.66s]  Do you want to put down the book?
[2228.66s -> 2230.74s]  Yeah. Where should we put the book?
[2230.74s -> 2232.58s]  In any any particular location you like?
[2237.14s -> 2237.66s]  Hello?
[2247.25s -> 2247.97s]  OK, I'm coming.
[2247.97s -> 2249.69s]  You're stuck at a wall.
[2249.69s -> 2252.09s]  Oh, the way you said that, you were like,
[2252.09s -> 2253.97s]  it sounded like you were trapped in the wall
[2253.97s -> 2259.75s]  and you didn't know how you got there.
[2259.75s -> 2260.67s]  Give me a sign.
[2260.67s -> 2262.43s]  We need to put the book down somewhere,
[2262.43s -> 2264.75s]  somewhere that's scary enough.
[2264.75s -> 2266.11s]  Yeah, I do.
[2266.19s -> 2269.06s]  It says it's blue, it's blue.
[2269.06s -> 2270.10s]  So there's nothing?
[2270.10s -> 2272.74s]  OK, there's nothing, there's nothing.
[2272.74s -> 2275.68s]  All right, let's my hands are full.
[2275.68s -> 2277.60s]  You're going to have to open the door.
[2277.60s -> 2279.92s]  What did I saw a thing here?
[2279.92s -> 2285.86s]  What? 5.9, 6.2, 6.2.
[2285.86s -> 2286.70s]  It's all good here.
[2286.70s -> 2288.30s]  What's the clock say?
[2288.30s -> 2292.56s]  I'm holding the thing that except sound that I'm getting decibels.
[2292.56s -> 2293.60s]  I don't know what's happening.
[2293.60s -> 2294.44s]  It's midnight.
[2294.44s -> 2297.36s]  I don't I don't know what that means, but I'll follow you.
[2298.96s -> 2300.44s]  Oh, that's actually really good.
[2300.44s -> 2306.76s]  This one, uh, give us a sign.
[2306.76s -> 2307.88s]  Give us a sign.
[2307.88s -> 2309.12s]  You're the piano man.
[2309.12s -> 2310.72s]  Give us a sign.
[2310.72s -> 2313.80s]  It's probably where you were, Vinny, if you're getting a reading there.
[2313.80s -> 2315.28s]  It's probably in that hallway.
[2315.28s -> 2316.84s]  We can do can you speak?
[2316.84s -> 2319.48s]  And let's let's make sure that it's not just you speaking.
[2319.48s -> 2322.08s]  OK. Hello.
[2322.08s -> 2323.08s]  I'm a ghost hunter.
[2323.08s -> 2324.24s]  Hello.
[2324.24s -> 2325.36s]  Creepy ghosts.
[2325.36s -> 2327.76s]  You got a five dB voice, apparently.
[2327.76s -> 2330.87s]  Oh, I'm quiet.
[2330.87s -> 2332.95s]  My friends tell me otherwise.
[2332.95s -> 2337.07s]  It's so funny because honest to God, all four of us don't need to be here doing this.
[2337.07s -> 2339.31s]  Like, like two of us could do this, right?
[2339.31s -> 2341.83s]  Right. We could split up into like scuba groups.
[2341.83s -> 2344.15s]  You know, like, yeah, yeah.
[2344.15s -> 2346.19s]  We're just blocking the hallway for each other.
[2346.19s -> 2347.47s]  That's so funny.
[2347.47s -> 2349.11s]  There's I don't think there's anything here.
[2349.11s -> 2350.87s]  Never mind. Like, let's let's be honest.
[2350.87s -> 2351.99s]  What am I doing?
[2351.99s -> 2354.19s]  What is my job right now?
[2354.19s -> 2356.07s]  You're holding the flashlight.
[2356.07s -> 2358.47s]  Yeah, you are Ross's lifeline right now.
[2358.47s -> 2360.83s]  Yeah. Without you, I can't see.
[2361.83s -> 2365.81s]  That says nothing in there.
[2365.81s -> 2367.33s]  Well, I think it's probably downstairs.
[2367.33s -> 2368.61s]  Oh, we didn't check this room yet.
[2368.61s -> 2370.09s]  It's got to be downstairs.
[2370.09s -> 2372.37s]  I can't open it because I have a ghost.
[2372.37s -> 2373.69s]  Fellas, don't worry.
[2373.69s -> 2375.69s]  I can get the door.
[2375.69s -> 2377.37s]  Thanks, Jerma.
[2377.37s -> 2378.57s]  Thanks, Jerma.
[2378.57s -> 2380.17s]  Are we in the bathroom, ghost?
[2380.17s -> 2381.57s]  Are we in the bathroom?
[2381.57s -> 2383.33s]  No, it's still blue.
[2383.33s -> 2384.33s]  Still blue.
[2384.33s -> 2385.73s]  74 dB.
[2385.73s -> 2389.53s]  Yeah, the EMF is still reading absolutely nothing.
[2389.53s -> 2391.17s]  How?
[2391.57s -> 2392.57s]  I guess it's downstairs.
[2392.57s -> 2394.21s]  I guess it's downstairs. Yeah.
[2394.21s -> 2397.29s]  I mean, there is a isn't this house have a basement or?
[2397.29s -> 2399.05s]  It might actually.
[2399.05s -> 2400.93s]  Yeah. I might think of the first one.
[2400.93s -> 2402.41s]  What is that? What is that?
[2402.41s -> 2404.81s]  What happened?
[2404.81s -> 2405.65s]  You're good.
[2405.65s -> 2407.50s]  Something happened.
[2407.50s -> 2409.60s]  No, no, I.
[2409.60s -> 2410.40s]  I.
[2410.40s -> 2411.24s]  Nothing.
[2411.24s -> 2413.60s]  Spider land on you.
[2413.60s -> 2415.92s]  It was itchy. I thought it was a fucking centipede.
[2415.92s -> 2416.92s]  Spider.
[2416.92s -> 2418.04s]  Centipede.
[2418.04s -> 2419.76s]  I'm all right.
[2419.76s -> 2421.72s]  Once we know where it is, we can use the salt.
[2421.72s -> 2424.76s]  Imagine being in VR and having a centipede climb on your neck.
[2424.76s -> 2429.88s]  You just click when it's active, but don't use it just yet.
[2429.88s -> 2432.52s]  And I was like, you know, I was going like this behind the pillow.
[2432.52s -> 2434.80s]  And then I was like, what is that? This feels fuzzy.
[2434.80s -> 2437.12s]  And it was a house centipede on my hand.
[2437.12s -> 2439.08s]  Oh, my God.
[2439.08s -> 2440.60s]  It was the worst and it was huge.
[2440.60s -> 2442.68s]  It was the size of like three quarters.
[2442.68s -> 2446.40s]  Is it weird that I would rather have Jason fucking chase me through a house
[2446.40s -> 2448.80s]  than have that experience where you just had.
[2448.80s -> 2449.76s]  What would you rather?
[2449.76s -> 2452.36s]  I would rather be chased in a house with Jason behind me
[2452.36s -> 2455.38s]  than have a centipede around my neck in bed.
[2455.38s -> 2457.42s]  You see how disgusting how centipedes are.
[2457.42s -> 2459.26s]  They're like the worst.
[2459.26s -> 2460.62s]  There's a pentagram in here.
[2460.62s -> 2462.14s]  So I think we're close.
[2462.14s -> 2463.34s]  No, it's normal.
[2463.34s -> 2464.38s]  Is it normal?
[2464.38s -> 2467.78s]  Yeah, I don't. I don't think I recognize that from the last update.
[2467.78s -> 2469.94s]  No, on Zillow, they showed the pentagram.
[2469.94s -> 2471.22s]  It was fine. Oh, I see.
[2471.22s -> 2474.90s]  OK. Oh, wait a minute.
[2474.90s -> 2477.62s]  Oh, your ghost. Hello.
[2477.62s -> 2479.18s]  How old are you?
[2479.18s -> 2480.22s]  What is your name?
[2480.22s -> 2481.82s]  What is your name, ghost?
[2481.82s -> 2482.98s]  What is your name, ghost?
[2482.98s -> 2485.14s]  And I'm just waiting for the
[2485.14s -> 2486.62s]  Oh, did you close that door?
[2486.62s -> 2488.22s]  What the fuck was that?
[2488.22s -> 2489.74s]  Sound like a door opening.
[2489.74s -> 2491.14s]  Something.
[2492.36s -> 2496.42s]  Guys, shh, shh, smoke stick activated coming out.
[2496.42s -> 2497.86s]  Fifteen, twenty DB.
[2497.86s -> 2500.19s]  Smoke stick activated.
[2500.19s -> 2501.39s]  Fifty two DB.
[2501.39s -> 2502.95s]  Where's the cross?
[2502.95s -> 2506.47s]  In the name of the Lord, Savior, Christ.
[2506.47s -> 2507.47s]  I can fuck.
[2507.47s -> 2511.36s]  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[2511.36s -> 2514.12s]  Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[2514.12s -> 2515.32s]  As it is in heaven.
[2515.32s -> 2517.12s]  Give us this hallowed.
[2517.12s -> 2519.44s]  Is a ghost laughing or somebody else laughing?
[2519.44s -> 2522.40s]  And I'm sorry, I'm just I'm laughing.
[2522.40s -> 2524.76s]  Oh, that was a ghost laugh.
[2525.08s -> 2527.05s]  That was me all along.
[2527.05s -> 2530.09s]  You were like just close enough to my left ear where it was like
[2531.13s -> 2533.44s]  you were inside of my left ear.
[2533.44s -> 2535.04s]  I'm so sorry.
[2535.04s -> 2537.08s]  Oh, OK.
[2537.08s -> 2538.76s]  Um, it's not down here.
[2538.76s -> 2540.36s]  It's upstairs. Yeah, it went back up.
[2540.36s -> 2542.44s]  Yeah, I don't like this one.
[2545.42s -> 2548.02s]  Here is our home.
[2548.02s -> 2550.55s]  Oh, what?
[2550.55s -> 2553.83s]  Do I sprint in there? No, no, no.
[2553.83s -> 2556.74s]  You will. You might die if you do that.
[2556.74s -> 2559.02s]  Oh, this one's like scurrying around.
[2559.02s -> 2560.22s]  I'm going back.
[2560.22s -> 2564.99s]  Oh, you're done.
[2567.80s -> 2570.08s]  Well, I guess the crucifix didn't work.
[2570.08s -> 2571.52s]  German, where are you?
[2571.52s -> 2574.16s]  Oh, shit. I have to go find you. Where are you?
[2574.16s -> 2575.32s]  Are you down in the basement?
[2575.32s -> 2576.84s]  Well, that's a great question.
[2576.84s -> 2577.76s]  I got you. I got you.
[2577.76s -> 2579.48s]  Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?
[2579.48s -> 2580.88s]  Guys. Holy shit, dude.
[2580.88s -> 2583.36s]  Um, it yanked my flashlight out of my hand.
[2583.36s -> 2585.08s]  What? Did it get Vinny?
[2585.08s -> 2586.44s]  It got Vinny. He's dead, I think.
[2586.44s -> 2589.04s]  Oh, look, there's his head.
[2589.52s -> 2591.00s]  I saw him on the floor.
[2591.00s -> 2594.00s]  I was like, we should probably go back to the house.
[2594.00s -> 2595.28s]  The spirit box is useless.
[2595.28s -> 2597.28s]  How do you open it? Oh, no, the door just closed.
[2597.28s -> 2598.40s]  Oh, thank God.
[2598.40s -> 2600.72s]  Did you get level five in the EMF or did you just freak out?
[2601.52s -> 2603.88s]  I did. I just panicked and ran.
[2603.88s -> 2605.98s]  I couldn't I couldn't see anything.
[2605.98s -> 2607.46s]  I do two flashlights.
[2607.46s -> 2609.54s]  We can we can regroup here.
[2609.54s -> 2610.97s]  Talk about it.
[2610.97s -> 2613.90s]  Try to pick that. No, that thing's useless, you said.
[2613.90s -> 2617.67s]  OK. Oh, what did he drop it?
[2617.67s -> 2619.67s]  So we should I should not pick this thing up.
[2619.67s -> 2621.16s]  Grab a flashlight.
[2621.16s -> 2624.49s]  I got it. OK.
[2624.49s -> 2627.87s]  All right. So what do we know so far?
[2627.87s -> 2630.03s]  Did your EMF reach level five at all?
[2631.45s -> 2633.30s]  No, it didn't.
[2633.30s -> 2636.64s]  At least if it did, I didn't see it.
[2636.64s -> 2639.16s]  OK, let me see if the crucifix even helped at all.
[2640.46s -> 2642.18s]  No, no, he died.
[2642.18s -> 2645.62s]  OK, well, we all have really terrible sanity.
[2645.62s -> 2647.94s]  Let's work on that real quick.
[2647.98s -> 2649.62s]  Do we take pills or?
[2649.62s -> 2650.90s]  Yeah. How many do we have?
[2650.90s -> 2651.82s]  Oh, my God, it's bad.
[2651.82s -> 2654.87s]  Bill's here. Bill's here.
[2654.87s -> 2655.67s]  So we just wait. Shit.
[2655.67s -> 2657.75s]  I dropped I dropped the shit.
[2657.75s -> 2660.78s]  There we go. And it's just I just.
[2660.78s -> 2661.86s]  Yeah. Right.
[2661.86s -> 2663.22s]  Click. Did I do it?
[2663.22s -> 2665.02s]  I heard the sound. It probably worked.
[2665.02s -> 2666.67s]  Yeah. Yeah, it worked.
[2666.67s -> 2668.91s]  My hands are sweaty, so I'm dropping shit.
[2668.91s -> 2669.91s]  I was so loud.
[2669.91s -> 2673.26s]  All right. So we should take more than we take two pills.
[2676.06s -> 2677.58s]  Let's hang on just in case.
[2677.58s -> 2679.82s]  Yeah. We should ration them out.
[2679.82s -> 2681.18s]  Yeah, Vinny didn't get to eat it.
[2681.18s -> 2682.78s]  OK, I dropped the pill bottle.
[2682.78s -> 2684.22s]  It's on the ground right here.
[2684.22s -> 2686.02s]  I'm going to pick it up. I wish I put it.
[2686.02s -> 2687.79s]  How do I put something down here?
[2687.79s -> 2689.91s]  Give it to me. Oh, you got it. OK.
[2689.91s -> 2691.51s]  So what should I take instead?
[2691.51s -> 2693.75s]  Because I got a flashlight. That's it.
[2693.75s -> 2695.83s]  Did you use the smudge stick yet?
[2695.83s -> 2696.87s]  Yeah, I kind of panicked.
[2696.87s -> 2698.23s]  And just when we were down in the basement,
[2698.23s -> 2700.41s]  I clicked it and it made like a smoke thing.
[2700.41s -> 2701.49s]  It didn't work.
[2701.49s -> 2704.29s]  So we can you can use another one just in case it attacks again.
[2704.61s -> 2707.07s]  OK, I need the candle.
[2707.07s -> 2708.31s]  I have no clue what it is.
[2708.31s -> 2710.31s]  You did not get level five, correct?
[2710.31s -> 2711.63s]  I'm sorry. I didn't see.
[2711.63s -> 2713.43s]  I know I didn't see level five.
[2713.43s -> 2715.43s]  I just saw the level blue.
[2715.43s -> 2718.67s]  OK, we can rule those out then.
[2718.67s -> 2719.99s]  Let's check the journal.
[2719.99s -> 2721.79s]  Let's try and place it where the ghost might be.
[2721.79s -> 2723.23s]  He died in the hallway, right?
[2723.23s -> 2725.71s]  Oh, yeah, the door to the basement.
[2725.71s -> 2730.79s]  So. OK.
[2730.79s -> 2732.91s]  Yeah, we get a video camera set up yet.
[2732.91s -> 2735.55s]  Yeah, this one right here in the in the that
[2736.47s -> 2740.10s]  we're currently recording the office.
[2740.10s -> 2743.87s]  We should probably move that to where Vinny died.
[2743.87s -> 2747.47s]  OK, and then I'll place the journal and I have a journal.
[2747.47s -> 2749.69s]  Do you want to just place the camera?
[2749.69s -> 2752.29s]  Yeah, OK. Plus, you got VR.
[2752.29s -> 2757.90s]  You probably better than us.
[2757.90s -> 2766.38s]  OK, hit cameras right here.
[2766.38s -> 2780.28s]  Cameras right here.
[2780.28s -> 2782.29s]  But it was one of you guys lagging.
[2782.29s -> 2783.37s]  Wait, no, they're right here.
[2783.37s -> 2783.97s]  There's a ghost right here.
[2783.97s -> 2786.56s]  There's a ghost. I thought there's a ghost right here.
[2786.56s -> 2789.99s]  They're holding a cup.
[2789.99s -> 2791.30s]  Yeah, could this be?
[2791.30s -> 2792.02s]  I need everyone.
[2792.02s -> 2793.50s]  No one's going to believe me if that if I don't see this,
[2793.50s -> 2794.70s]  I'm going to look like a fucking weirdo.
[2794.70s -> 2800.36s]  I swear to God, this cup was moving.
[2800.36s -> 2802.26s]  Oh, he's fucking on this.
[2802.26s -> 2803.98s]  Yeah, you can do that when you're a ghost.
[2803.98s -> 2804.94s]  It's great. I love it.
[2804.94s -> 2814.37s]  I thought one of you were lagging for a second.
[2814.37s -> 2818.38s]  Which Vinny's communicating with us.
[2820.32s -> 2832.90s]  Liam, is your camera on right now?
[2832.90s -> 2834.38s]  Do you want it? Oh, I see a flashlight.
[2834.38s -> 2836.22s]  Oh, OK, OK. Yeah, I got it right here.
[2836.22s -> 2836.86s]  It's me right here.
[2836.86s -> 2840.22s]  OK, you got it. Oh, you found it.
[2840.22s -> 2841.74s]  Ross, do you see this floating mug?
[2841.74s -> 2843.99s]  Oh, where do you want to move to?
[2843.99s -> 2851.07s]  Something's behind it.
[2851.07s -> 2852.63s]  Something's loaded behind me right now.
[2852.63s -> 2853.95s]  Go somewhere and hide and be quiet.
[2853.95s -> 2855.43s]  Hold on. What?
[2855.43s -> 2857.63s]  Help. Help me.
[2857.63s -> 2859.95s]  Oh, smoke sticks.
[2859.95s -> 2861.19s]  Smoke stick.
[2861.91s -> 2862.71s]  I didn't get it.
[2862.71s -> 2863.71s]  Did it work?
[2863.71s -> 2864.71s]  God.
[2871.84s -> 2873.36s]  Smoke sticks.
[2873.36s -> 2874.36s]  Hi.
[2874.36s -> 2875.93s]  We want to get back here.
[2875.93s -> 2878.61s]  How you doing? Hey.
[2878.61s -> 2885.73s]  Oh, whoa, a ball.
[2885.73s -> 2888.17s]  So that was you that was moving the stuff around.
[2888.17s -> 2889.17s]  That's funny.
[2889.17s -> 2890.77s]  I was moving the coffee mug.
[2890.77s -> 2893.77s]  Yeah, I was moving it.
[2893.77s -> 2896.59s]  Are you on... Am I muffled when you hear me speak?
[2896.59s -> 2898.67s]  Yeah, you are talking through...
[2898.67s -> 2900.90s]  You're a very thin wall.
[2900.90s -> 2902.82s]  Yeah, exactly. OK.
[2902.82s -> 2905.46s]  Yeah, when you're ghost, you just get muffled.
[2905.46s -> 2906.78s]  Oh, that's OK.
[2906.78s -> 2909.82s]  Well, I can still kind of hear you.
[2909.82s -> 2916.82s]  Apparently, we have to go outside to fix that, so...
[2916.82s -> 2918.34s]  Roommate voice.
[2918.34s -> 2922.61s]  Yeah, that's how I lean over to the wall here and go...
[2922.61s -> 2926.27s]  Hey, man, you want anything from McDonald's?
[2926.27s -> 2928.95s]  Hey, can you lower your music?
[2928.95s -> 2930.59s]  Holy shit.
[2930.59s -> 2934.20s]  You just opened up the room to my apartment and did that.
[2934.20s -> 2934.96s]  Oh.
[2934.96s -> 2939.35s]  You're not muffled anymore.
[2939.35s -> 2944.87s]  You just stormed over and opened the door.
[2944.87s -> 2952.62s]  Please, I need you to lower the music.
[2952.66s -> 2954.77s]  So, where are they now?
[2954.77s -> 2958.49s]  Uh, I don't know, actually.
[2958.49s -> 2961.00s]  Maybe the basement?
[2961.00s -> 2964.10s]  Dude, let's mess with them.
[2964.10s -> 2967.26s]  All right, I'm going to grab...
[2967.26s -> 2968.74s]  Can we grab knives?
[2968.74s -> 2970.59s]  Let me see.
[2970.59s -> 2974.22s]  I can grab a fork.
[2974.22s -> 2976.73s]  Oh, OK, I got a plate.
[2976.73s -> 2977.53s]  All right.
[2977.53s -> 2979.29s]  Then we just need to find them.
[2979.29s -> 2982.42s]  Can I throw this and hit them with a plate?
[2982.42s -> 2983.78s]  I don't know if it'll hit.
[2983.78s -> 2984.90s]  I don't know if it'll be like a...
[2984.90s -> 2988.50s]  I wonder if it'll break.
[2988.50s -> 2994.10s]  Let's see if they're down here.
[2994.10s -> 2995.85s]  They're not down here.
[2995.85s -> 2999.52s]  Do you see this?
[2999.80s -> 3002.66s]  Do you see the lighter just bouncing?
[3002.66s -> 3004.99s]  No.
[3004.99s -> 3006.43s]  OK, I'm not making this up.
[3006.43s -> 3011.19s]  Like, there's a lighter that is just infinitely bouncing on my screen right now.
[3011.19s -> 3012.51s]  Somebody else is fucking with us.
[3012.51s -> 3015.39s]  Somebody died in the ghost world and now they're able to mess with the ghosts.
[3015.39s -> 3016.66s]  I see.
[3016.66s -> 3018.22s]  Yeah.
[3018.22s -> 3020.01s]  Oh, I think they've lost.
[3023.61s -> 3024.94s]  OK.
[3024.94s -> 3029.51s]  I imagine you guys lost.
[3029.51s -> 3030.43s]  All right.
[3030.43s -> 3032.19s]  It was a thay.
[3032.19s -> 3033.11s]  Of course.
[3033.11s -> 3034.35s]  How could I get that wrong?
[3034.35s -> 3035.55s]  How did I think of that?
[3035.55s -> 3037.79s]  I got 80 bucks for that.
[3037.79s -> 3038.95s]  Oh, good.
[3038.95s -> 3043.98s]  Last thing I saw was a lighter covered in repulsion gel.
[3043.98s -> 3044.94s]  What?
[3044.94s -> 3046.14s]  It was weird.
[3046.14s -> 3051.26s]  Yeah, someone, I'm sure, clipped it, but it was very strange.
[3051.26s -> 3053.97s]  So this game is scary.
[3053.97s -> 3055.13s]  That was good.
[3055.13s -> 3057.42s]  Oh, can I buy anything?
[3057.42s -> 3057.74s]  No.
[3057.74s -> 3058.42s]  Yeah.
[3058.42s -> 3059.66s]  If you have money.
[3059.66s -> 3060.90s]  Hmm.
[3060.90s -> 3063.30s]  Seems that two times of zero is still zero.
[3063.30s -> 3064.34s]  If I use the...
[3064.34s -> 3066.50s]  So if I use the smoke stick...
[3068.02s -> 3069.18s]  Does the smoke stick work?
[3069.18s -> 3071.70s]  OK, so if it's like, oh, you're about to get attacked by a ghost.
[3071.70s -> 3073.66s]  If I do the smoke stick, then they won't get me.
[3073.66s -> 3074.78s]  Is that how it is?
[3074.78s -> 3076.38s]  Ah, you know what?
[3076.38s -> 3078.94s]  I think we have to know what room it's in.
[3078.94s -> 3082.07s]  And then just when we're in the room, we just smudge.
[3082.07s -> 3083.51s]  I think that's what we did wrong.
[3083.51s -> 3084.67s]  Oh, OK.
[3084.67s -> 3087.95s]  Also, the cross have to drop it on the ground.
[3087.95s -> 3090.70s]  I was holding it up like a...
[3090.70s -> 3091.82s]  You knew that?
[3091.82s -> 3095.06s]  The first time I tried to do it, I did that exact same thing.
[3095.06s -> 3095.82s]  And you know what?
[3095.82s -> 3096.66s]  It didn't work.
[3096.66s -> 3100.06s]  So it wasn't 50-50.
[3100.14s -> 3101.34s]  I'm just bad.
[3101.34s -> 3103.70s]  Got it.
[3103.70s -> 3105.30s]  I figured it would work like that.
[3105.30s -> 3107.02s]  I mean, you see it in movies all the time.
[3107.02s -> 3108.66s]  You hold up the cross.
[3108.66s -> 3109.78s]  I know.
[3109.78s -> 3112.96s]  Yeah, that's what I thought.
[3112.96s -> 3113.80s]  Anyway.
[3113.80s -> 3116.40s]  Liam, can you vote on the asylum?
[3116.40s -> 3117.90s]  Yes.
[3117.90s -> 3120.02s]  None of us vote.
[3120.02s -> 3123.06s]  I'm assuming it's Sonny Meadows that I'm thinking of.
[3123.06s -> 3125.30s]  Chat will have to probably clarify what level it is.
[3125.30s -> 3126.42s]  Chat, is it Sonny Meadows?
[3126.42s -> 3127.86s]  It is, yeah, confirmed.
[3127.86s -> 3128.82s]  Perfect, OK.
[3128.82s -> 3132.30s]  I just saw one yes in my chat, and I took that as objective truth.
[3132.34s -> 3133.90s]  So, it's for me.
[3137.22s -> 3139.14s]  Do we have a thermometer?
[3139.14s -> 3142.70s]  We're probably going to need that.
[3142.70s -> 3144.87s]  We have a ther-pop-eter.
[3144.87s -> 3146.75s]  Don't laugh at that.
[3146.75s -> 3147.87s]  I could...
[3147.87s -> 3150.84s]  Playing this game alone would be hard, I think.
[3150.84s -> 3151.52s]  It'd be scary.
[3151.52s -> 3152.72s]  I tried it once.
[3152.72s -> 3154.92s]  I actually had to take the headset off one time,
[3154.92s -> 3156.20s]  because I was like...
[3156.20s -> 3157.16s]  I was too spoopy.
[3157.16s -> 3160.76s]  Yeah, it gets like too real in the headset, probably.
[3160.76s -> 3162.30s]  Yeah.
[3162.30s -> 3164.69s]  OK, well...
[3164.69s -> 3166.01s]  Let's...
[3167.09s -> 3169.45s]  Let's just go with what we have, I think.
[3169.45s -> 3171.05s]  Turn your lights off.
[3171.05s -> 3173.85s]  It's like two o'clock in the afternoon right now.
[3173.85s -> 3181.43s]  Like, there's no light. It's not going to do anything.
[3181.43s -> 3183.27s]  Crucifix does work in your hand.
[3183.27s -> 3185.79s]  It just has a small range, and it prevents the start of the hunt,
[3185.79s -> 3187.47s]  not if the ghost is already after you.
[3187.47s -> 3190.36s]  OK, I understand.
[3190.36s -> 3194.32s]  You West Coast lads, thank you for joining at the time,
[3194.32s -> 3197.00s]  because I wouldn't have been able to do this later.
[3197.00s -> 3197.56s]  This is perfect.
[3197.56s -> 3198.76s]  If it worked out, that's good.
[3198.76s -> 3201.82s]  Perfect for me.
[3201.82s -> 3204.54s]  My audience was like, this isn't my usual time,
[3204.54s -> 3206.98s]  so they're like, wait, why are you online?
[3206.98s -> 3209.15s]  Why are you here?
[3209.15s -> 3212.16s]  Please leave.
[3212.16s -> 3213.60s]  I just wish there was like a melee,
[3213.60s -> 3216.83s]  just like a single right-handed melee punch.
[3216.83s -> 3219.59s]  Punch the ghost?
[3219.59s -> 3225.26s]  I would be so much better at this game if that was in it.
[3225.26s -> 3226.34s]  Like, I would just be the guy that...
[3226.34s -> 3228.10s]  You just deck me out in like the melee gear,
[3228.10s -> 3228.94s]  and I just...
[3228.94s -> 3230.86s]  Even if I can only punch three times,
[3230.86s -> 3233.26s]  I would still be... I'd be so much better at this.
[3234.66s -> 3237.70s]  Jerem, I think, ready up, and we'll go into the...
[3237.74s -> 3238.90s]  Sorry, it's my problem.
[3238.90s -> 3239.46s]  Oops.
[3239.46s -> 3242.75s]  It's OK.
[3242.75s -> 3246.05s]  We get it. You like Dark Souls.
[3246.05s -> 3255.33s]  Great franchise.
[3255.33s -> 3257.62s]  All right.
[3257.62s -> 3258.42s]  Everyone load in?
[3258.42s -> 3259.26s]  OK.
[3259.26s -> 3260.42s]  Yep.
[3260.42s -> 3264.54s]  Get a ghost to blow out a candle.
[3264.54s -> 3265.46s]  I'm taking the cross.
[3265.46s -> 3267.14s]  Have a member of your team escape the ghost during a hunt.
[3267.14s -> 3269.54s]  Repel the ghost with a smudge stick.
[3269.54s -> 3273.96s]  OK.
[3273.96s -> 3277.89s]  Well, you know, when I was writing the Ghostbusters film,
[3277.89s -> 3280.15s]  I got a lot of inspiration.
[3280.15s -> 3280.59s]  The trap.
[3280.59s -> 3284.90s]  Let me tell you, the ghost didn't blow out a candle.
[3284.90s -> 3289.15s]  Who wants to bring the candle and lighter?
[3289.15s -> 3291.03s]  I'm walking around with this thing.
[3291.03s -> 3292.23s]  I got two spots.
[3292.23s -> 3293.19s]  I'll take the EMS.
[3293.19s -> 3294.63s]  What is the rice scanner?
[3294.63s -> 3297.22s]  What's this thing?
[3297.22s -> 3301.10s]  That... You just picked up a thermometer.
[3301.10s -> 3301.78s]  That helps.
[3301.78s -> 3303.82s]  If we're looking for freezing temperatures,
[3303.82s -> 3304.90s]  we need that.
[3304.90s -> 3306.78s]  Why is this flash, like, crusty?
[3306.78s -> 3308.22s]  Basically, we just need to make sure...
[3308.22s -> 3311.70s]  We need to rule out all of the possible evidence
[3311.74s -> 3315.98s]  for the ghost type by using, like, the spirit box EMS,
[3315.98s -> 3317.62s]  just spreading them between all four of us.
[3317.62s -> 3319.14s]  OK.
[3319.14s -> 3320.94s]  So I have a cross.
[3320.94s -> 3322.78s]  I'm taking the cross.
[3322.78s -> 3323.26s]  OK.
[3327.50s -> 3328.66s]  I got a spare slot.
[3328.66s -> 3330.06s]  Do you want to take anything?
[3330.06s -> 3331.90s]  Can you take the journal again?
[3331.90s -> 3333.22s]  Yep.
[3333.22s -> 3338.14s]  And once we know where it is, roughly, we can come back,
[3338.14s -> 3343.26s]  get a camera, and then go back in.
[3343.26s -> 3344.99s]  Beatboxing?
[3344.99s -> 3349.31s]  No, I'm just pretending this is a weapon.
[3349.31s -> 3351.27s]  I thought you were, like, spraying compressed air.
[3351.27s -> 3352.27s]  I was like...
[3355.55s -> 3358.19s]  From his mouth.
[3358.19s -> 3360.27s]  All right, let's do this.
[3360.27s -> 3361.11s]  I got a candle.
[3361.11s -> 3362.67s]  Don't make me pick up the whipped cream can
[3362.67s -> 3365.47s]  and turn it upside down and do that funny joke.
[3365.47s -> 3367.95s]  Oh, this is... You should.
[3367.95s -> 3368.95s]  Yeah.
[3368.95s -> 3370.23s]  It looks like I'm not a bum.
[3370.23s -> 3372.79s]  Did anybody take an EMF?
[3372.83s -> 3375.15s]  Yeah, OK.
[3375.15s -> 3378.83s]  This place is actually kind of terrifying.
[3378.83s -> 3380.11s]  I hate it.
[3380.11s -> 3381.15s]  All right, I'm leaving.
[3381.15s -> 3381.75s]  All right.
[3381.75s -> 3382.75s]  See you.
[3388.96s -> 3390.04s]  OK.
[3390.04s -> 3391.80s]  Already?
[3391.80s -> 3393.32s]  I've not played this map before.
[3393.32s -> 3394.28s]  OK.
[3394.28s -> 3395.96s]  We're all screwed.
[3395.96s -> 3401.18s]  Hey, Liam, when do I light the candle?
[3401.18s -> 3403.10s]  Once we know where it is.
[3403.10s -> 3405.54s]  It's all basically contingent on one...
[3405.54s -> 3409.44s]  Six bucks.
[3409.44s -> 3411.74s]  How much do you guys think this chair is worth?
[3411.74s -> 3413.14s]  Take a guess, like, all three.
[3413.14s -> 3414.22s]  At least one.
[3414.22s -> 3414.86s]  One dollar?
[3414.86s -> 3415.38s]  Don't look at the price.
[3415.38s -> 3416.54s]  Don't look at the price.
[3416.54s -> 3420.22s]  Oh, if the price is right, I'm going to say $14.
[3420.22s -> 3421.34s]  $14?
[3421.34s -> 3422.42s]  $35.
[3422.42s -> 3424.78s]  I'm going to say $35 and one cent.
[3424.78s -> 3425.42s]  OK.
[3425.42s -> 3427.47s]  All right, let's see.
[3427.47s -> 3429.31s]  Sassy.
[3429.31s -> 3431.35s]  That was $12.
[3431.35s -> 3433.78s]  So who was closer?
[3433.78s -> 3435.30s]  I said $14.
[3435.30s -> 3436.66s]  Yeah, that was close.
[3436.66s -> 3437.34s]  You win it.
[3437.34s -> 3438.42s]  It's your chair now.
[3439.10s -> 3439.74s]  You win the chair.
[3439.74s -> 3442.02s]  Why is there a price gun in this game?
[3442.02s -> 3446.52s]  That's what I was trying to ask.
[3446.52s -> 3448.16s]  Something behind this door.
[3448.16s -> 3453.26s]  When you turn it on, look for temperatures.
[3453.26s -> 3453.98s]  It's 30.
[3453.98s -> 3454.82s]  OK.
[3454.82s -> 3455.66s]  Oh, it's Celsius.
[3455.66s -> 3457.88s]  I don't know what this means.
[3457.88s -> 3458.44s]  Celsius.
[3458.44s -> 3459.60s]  Oh, I'm the Canadian here.
[3459.60s -> 3460.72s]  I can discern.
[3460.72s -> 3462.20s]  All right, so what is bad?
[3462.20s -> 3464.12s]  What am I looking for here?
[3464.12s -> 3467.84s]  Well, you want, like, negative temperatures.
[3467.84s -> 3468.92s]  OK.
[3468.92s -> 3469.60s]  Apparently 10.
[3469.60s -> 3473.17s]  So once it goes below zero.
[3473.17s -> 3473.65s]  OK.
[3473.65s -> 3475.29s]  Good to know.
[3475.29s -> 3476.89s]  Pretty cold, pretty cold in here.
[3476.89s -> 3484.53s]  OK, I dropped my.
[3484.53s -> 3487.37s]  This is the loudest clicking.
[3487.37s -> 3488.25s]  That's what we're doing.
[3488.25s -> 3490.20s]  It is a joke.
[3490.20s -> 3491.92s]  OK, I'm doing that with my mouth.
[3491.92s -> 3493.80s]  That's how loud that is.
[3493.80s -> 3497.08s]  That's me going.
[3497.08s -> 3500.74s]  Ross, is your EMF on?
[3500.74s -> 3501.86s]  Yes.
[3501.86s -> 3503.34s]  OK, perfect.
[3503.34s -> 3504.78s]  And it is so blue.
[3504.78s -> 3508.13s]  I'm not sure is VR or real life.
[3508.13s -> 3515.94s]  Like, I don't know what's happening.
[3515.94s -> 3517.44s]  Books.
[3517.44s -> 3519.76s]  Star dies in crash.
[3519.76s -> 3522.12s]  Man eats self.
[3522.12s -> 3523.28s]  Oh, man enters space.
[3526.44s -> 3527.44s]  That's less gruesome.
[3532.33s -> 3534.53s]  Man eats self.
[3534.53s -> 3535.97s]  That's the headline for today.
[3539.29s -> 3540.09s]  Extra, extra.
[3540.09s -> 3540.81s]  Read all about it.
[3540.81s -> 3542.97s]  Man eats self.
[3542.97s -> 3544.41s]  Definitely on a slow news day.
[3544.41s -> 3546.13s]  Yo, Liam, come here.
[3546.13s -> 3547.29s]  I lost my flashlight.
[3547.29s -> 3548.45s]  Hold on.
[3548.45s -> 3551.13s]  Do you see this glass?
[3551.13s -> 3554.74s]  What movie is that from?
[3554.74s -> 3557.22s]  I'm just going to say Blade Runner.
[3557.22s -> 3560.18s]  Wait, what?
[3560.18s -> 3561.42s]  How would you know that?
[3561.42s -> 3563.50s]  The one they drink whiskey from in Blade Runner,
[3563.50s -> 3566.90s]  where Harrison Ford is like, just walking every scene.
[3566.90s -> 3568.86s]  Like, it's in other things.
[3568.86s -> 3570.10s]  Lightning.
[3570.10s -> 3571.38s]  Just let me have this.
[3571.38s -> 3573.38s]  OK.
[3573.38s -> 3574.90s]  Thunder.
[3574.90s -> 3576.86s]  OK.
[3576.86s -> 3578.38s]  Are these the only rooms?
[3578.38s -> 3580.22s]  No, there's got to be more rooms.
[3580.54s -> 3581.06s]  Hold on.
[3581.06s -> 3583.50s]  10 degrees so far.
[3583.50s -> 3584.10s]  What about this?
[3584.10s -> 3585.74s]  Is this a door we can open?
[3585.74s -> 3587.14s]  I can't, because my hands are full.
[3587.14s -> 3589.98s]  But can someone check out these doors?
[3589.98s -> 3591.02s]  Oh, it opens.
[3591.02s -> 3593.66s]  Well, now that makes a whole lot more sense.
[3593.66s -> 3596.75s]  I was going to say, this is a pretty small map.
[3596.75s -> 3598.35s]  Oh, there's a staircase downstairs.
[3598.35s -> 3598.83s]  Oh, god.
[3598.83s -> 3599.31s]  OK.
[3599.31s -> 3601.78s]  Oh, god.
[3601.78s -> 3603.22s]  All right.
[3603.22s -> 3605.26s]  Don't push me.
[3605.26s -> 3606.42s]  I'm sorry.
[3606.42s -> 3612.37s]  I like this.
[3612.37s -> 3616.73s]  I found wet wipes.
[3616.73s -> 3619.17s]  Oh, wait, no, that's just never mind.
[3619.17s -> 3619.69s]  Are you here?
[3619.69s -> 3622.35s]  Give us a sign.
[3622.35s -> 3623.55s]  What was that?
[3623.55s -> 3625.67s]  Was that me?
[3625.67s -> 3626.59s]  Oh, it's locked.
[3626.59s -> 3628.25s]  OK, OK, OK.
[3628.25s -> 3629.69s]  All right, back up.
[3629.69s -> 3630.85s]  All right, so the basement.
[3630.85s -> 3631.97s]  Oh, my god.
[3631.97s -> 3639.18s]  We don't have to worry about the basement.
[3639.18s -> 3644.10s]  OK, in real life, lads, how scared would you be?
[3644.10s -> 3648.15s]  That, now that is spooky.
[3648.15s -> 3652.43s]  As we got a crucifix, we've got a man.
[3652.43s -> 3652.95s]  What?
[3652.95s -> 3655.23s]  There's a sacrifice written on the wall.
[3655.23s -> 3661.07s]  It's like that place in, was it Winterhold in Skyrim?
[3661.07s -> 3662.75s]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3662.75s -> 3664.35s]  Except demonic.
[3664.35s -> 3667.35s]  What's this thing down here?
[3667.35s -> 3669.47s]  It's like a music box, and it's circled.
[3669.47s -> 3674.12s]  I'm sure nothing bad will happen if I.
[3674.12s -> 3675.52s]  Oh, you didn't just.
[3675.52s -> 3677.28s]  Why would you do that?
[3677.28s -> 3679.04s]  Why would you do that?
[3679.04s -> 3680.80s]  Do you like this music, Ghost?
[3680.80s -> 3684.04s]  Can you please answer me?
[3684.04s -> 3685.12s]  I'm sitting back here.
[3685.12s -> 3686.24s]  I know what's going to happen.
[3686.24s -> 3687.44s]  We're going to get the.
[3687.44s -> 3688.92s]  Oh, it's time to play.
[3694.48s -> 3695.28s]  Here it comes.
[3695.28s -> 3697.60s]  What was that?
[3697.60s -> 3698.96s]  It's still blue, guys.
[3698.96s -> 3700.60s]  There's no ghost.
[3700.60s -> 3702.24s]  No ghost, OK.
[3702.24s -> 3703.00s]  Not Elmo.
[3703.00s -> 3705.08s]  Elmo wants to play.
[3705.08s -> 3708.62s]  No, it's like.
[3708.62s -> 3709.38s]  Pretty good.
[3709.38s -> 3712.90s]  It was supposed to be like, oh, the scary little girl ghost,
[3712.90s -> 3715.78s]  right?
[3715.78s -> 3718.10s]  I think so.
[3718.10s -> 3719.78s]  Oh, UV light.
[3719.78s -> 3720.62s]  Got it, OK.
[3720.62s -> 3722.46s]  There's like knocked over responses.
[3722.46s -> 3725.06s]  I'm kind of surprised this place hasn't burned to the ground
[3725.06s -> 3726.50s]  by now.
[3726.50s -> 3728.77s]  Yeah.
[3728.77s -> 3731.09s]  I don't know the Lord's word.
[3731.09s -> 3734.65s]  There's a re-claw mark here.
[3734.65s -> 3738.44s]  There's a claw mark of swiping claw and blood.
[3738.44s -> 3742.50s]  Oh, I'm pretty sure that's for decoration.
[3742.50s -> 3744.10s]  I think it might be an animal.
[3744.10s -> 3745.94s]  OK, this is like the whole thing.
[3745.94s -> 3748.46s]  The ghost is actually a jaguar.
[3748.46s -> 3751.34s]  Wait, what you mean to say is that this asylum
[3751.34s -> 3755.55s]  has been turned into a spirit Halloween?
[3755.55s -> 3757.59s]  As is the fate of any abandoned building.
[3760.07s -> 3762.30s]  Boss, I think I told you.
[3762.30s -> 3764.70s]  I heard something outside, by the way, guys.
[3764.70s -> 3767.98s]  Fallout set I showed you, like where it was.
[3767.98s -> 3769.06s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3769.06s -> 3771.06s]  You know, like where they filmed some of the Fallout show.
[3771.06s -> 3776.26s]  It's now a spirit Halloween.
[3776.26s -> 3777.34s]  Of course.
[3777.34s -> 3779.06s]  Of course it is.
[3779.06s -> 3783.82s]  It's getting colder, 6.6 degrees Celsius right now.
[3784.34s -> 3786.30s]  Dropping rapidly, 4.4.
[3786.30s -> 3788.14s]  I just like pianos in VR games.
[3788.14s -> 3789.46s]  4.4, do I light the candle now?
[3789.46s -> 3791.74s]  There's a...
[3791.74s -> 3793.34s]  Going back, 9.1.
[3793.34s -> 3796.34s]  Wait, wait, what just happened?
[3796.34s -> 3797.94s]  The temperature is going all over the place.
[3797.94s -> 3798.78s]  We're at 5.5.
[3798.78s -> 3799.98s]  Yes, that's a piece of evidence.
[3799.98s -> 3802.10s]  We need that for the ghost.
[3802.10s -> 3804.86s]  Rapidly changing temperature.
[3804.86s -> 3807.70s]  In your evidence, write down freezing temperatures.
[3807.70s -> 3809.42s]  Sorry, I'm clicking.
[3809.42s -> 3811.34s]  I only have one free hand.
[3811.34s -> 3815.90s]  Yeah, it's going from like 4.5 to like 9.0 to like 4.1.
[3816.90s -> 3818.90s]  It's jumping all over the place.
[3818.90s -> 3822.30s]  If it went down that cold, it has to go below zero.
[3822.30s -> 3824.30s]  Yeah, we're not at zero yet.
[3824.30s -> 3825.26s]  Okay, nevermind.
[3825.26s -> 3827.10s]  Well, I guess we might be close then.
[3828.34s -> 3831.30s]  Fluctuating temperatures, is that in the evidence anywhere?
[3831.30s -> 3832.34s]  No.
[3832.34s -> 3833.90s]  It has to go freezing, I think.
[3833.90s -> 3835.66s]  But we must be close.
[3835.66s -> 3836.50s]  Should we open the door?
[3836.50s -> 3840.48s]  Either that or just try to kill us and it couldn't find us.
[3840.56s -> 3841.76s]  Ghost, please answer.
[3841.76s -> 3843.62s]  Hello?
[3843.62s -> 3845.86s]  You're getting sick of your shit.
[3845.86s -> 3847.42s]  Yeah, ghosts.
[3847.42s -> 3849.74s]  Zombie ghosts, leave this place.
[3849.74s -> 3852.82s]  Zombie ghosts, leave this place.
[3852.82s -> 3853.66s]  Yeah, big hallway.
[3853.66s -> 3855.70s]  I'll be on my deathbed and I'll remember that video.
[3855.70s -> 3856.54s]  Big hallway.
[3862.85s -> 3869.00s]  If you are here, give us a sign.
[3869.00s -> 3870.24s]  Give us a sign.
[3870.24s -> 3871.08s]  We found the room.
[3871.08s -> 3873.90s]  You had to set off the...
[3873.90s -> 3875.26s]  We found the room.
[3875.26s -> 3876.38s]  That was me.
[3876.38s -> 3877.22s]  Sorry.
[3877.22s -> 3878.06s]  That was you?
[3878.58s -> 3879.42s]  I was so excited for a second.
[3879.42s -> 3880.62s]  I pressed that.
[3880.62s -> 3882.74s]  Guys, I found a book of fairy tales.
[3883.74s -> 3885.54s]  By Hans Christian Andersen.
[3886.54s -> 3888.98s]  Yeah, I love how there's just a shower running
[3888.98s -> 3891.18s]  the entire time we're walking around here.
[3893.55s -> 3894.87s]  That white noise is good for me.
[3894.87s -> 3895.99s]  I like it.
[3895.99s -> 3897.59s]  Yeah, that's why I keep it on.
[3897.59s -> 3901.94s]  I know it's not a good idea, but I do it anyway.
[3901.94s -> 3902.78s]  Do you hear that?
[3902.78s -> 3909.56s]  Hit thunder?
[3909.56s -> 3910.40s]  Weird.
[3910.40s -> 3911.24s]  I was so excited.
[3911.24s -> 3912.08s]  I thought we found the room.
[3913.70s -> 3915.38s]  Wait, temperature check.
[3916.02s -> 3918.39s]  Oh, more Deckard drinks.
[3918.39s -> 3921.30s]  5.3, 10.2.
[3921.30s -> 3922.54s]  This is fluctuating.
[3923.82s -> 3924.66s]  Is it?
[3924.66s -> 3928.30s]  5.5, 10.0, 6.3.
[3928.30s -> 3929.82s]  Try moving to different parts of the room.
[3929.82s -> 3931.30s]  See if it gets really cold.
[3933.68s -> 3936.52s]  10.4, 4.8 in the corner here.
[3936.52s -> 3937.68s]  10.1 in the corner.
[3939.06s -> 3942.38s]  It's going from like 10 to three to four to 10 to...
[3942.38s -> 3944.14s]  That's a big change, isn't it?
[3946.22s -> 3948.48s]  He just walked off on his own.
[3948.60s -> 3949.44s]  Oh, that's great.
[3949.44s -> 3950.28s]  I'm good.
[3950.28s -> 3951.12s]  I'm just...
[3951.12s -> 3951.96s]  Okay.
[3951.96s -> 3952.80s]  Hey.
[3952.80s -> 3953.64s]  Oh, nevermind.
[3953.64s -> 3954.48s]  Nevermind.
[3954.48s -> 3955.64s]  This door is glitched.
[3955.64s -> 3956.48s]  Is it?
[3956.48s -> 3957.32s]  Do you see?
[3957.32s -> 3960.36s]  Why is this door like comically huge?
[3962.54s -> 3964.82s]  Is anyone else seeing how big this door is?
[3966.30s -> 3967.30s]  It is kind of big.
[3969.02s -> 3971.06s]  This is Andre the Giant's bedroom.
[3971.06s -> 3971.90s]  No, seriously.
[3971.90s -> 3973.86s]  Is it reaching the ceiling for you guys?
[3973.86s -> 3974.70s]  No, no.
[3974.70s -> 3975.54s]  No.
[3975.54s -> 3977.38s]  I think you got a silly door.
[3977.54s -> 3978.38s]  I got a silly door.
[3979.78s -> 3981.90s]  I swear I have a Monty Python-esque door.
[3981.90s -> 3983.90s]  It's really wacky.
[3986.55s -> 3987.59s]  A little ghost.
[3991.17s -> 3992.97s]  Sounded like I sounded two days ago.
[3994.38s -> 3995.42s]  Hold on.
[3995.42s -> 3997.86s]  Do I look like I'm in the washing machine?
[3997.86s -> 3998.70s]  You do.
[3998.70s -> 3999.54s]  You sure do.
[3999.54s -> 4000.38s]  5.1.
[4000.38s -> 4003.42s]  Oh, it's like that scene in Better Call Saul, Vinny.
[4003.42s -> 4004.70s]  So he's Gus.
[4004.70s -> 4005.54s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[4005.54s -> 4007.46s]  I haven't seen past the first episode.
[4007.46s -> 4008.30s]  How can this be possible?
[4008.30s -> 4009.30s]  Shit, I'm so sorry.
[4009.30s -> 4010.14s]  Well.
[4010.14s -> 4011.78s]  There's a guy named Saul.
[4011.78s -> 4013.10s]  I'm kidding.
[4013.10s -> 4015.22s]  I've seen past the second season.
[4015.22s -> 4016.06s]  Okay.
[4017.76s -> 4019.36s]  Past the second season, okay.
[4023.81s -> 4025.29s]  Past the first episode, it's like, all right,
[4025.29s -> 4026.81s]  so you just literally haven't even seen the show.
[4026.81s -> 4028.53s]  Okay.
[4028.53s -> 4029.93s]  Yeah.
[4029.93s -> 4033.09s]  Oh yeah, no, I saw the first episode five years ago once.
[4036.49s -> 4039.69s]  I watched it when it premiered,
[4039.69s -> 4042.21s]  but only the first five minutes.
[4042.21s -> 4045.05s]  I lost everybody.
[4045.05s -> 4046.25s]  I lost everybody.
[4046.25s -> 4047.09s]  Where do I go?
[4050.62s -> 4051.78s]  Yeah, just down the hallway here.
[4051.78s -> 4053.34s]  Oh, thank God.
[4057.91s -> 4061.02s]  Can we just like turn the lights on maybe?
[4061.02s -> 4063.10s]  8.3, no, it's not, not cold.
[4063.10s -> 4064.96s]  Well, hold on.
[4064.96s -> 4066.00s]  Yeah.
[4066.00s -> 4074.31s]  4.5.
[4074.31s -> 4075.55s]  Every time I think I hear a noise,
[4075.55s -> 4077.15s]  it's just like some object that someone actually.
[4077.15s -> 4082.14s]  Yeah, something's moving.
[4082.14s -> 4083.34s]  Still nothing, huh?
[4083.34s -> 4085.02s]  No EMF or anything?
[4085.02s -> 4087.90s]  Yeah, and I got no, oh, my flashlight just.
[4087.90s -> 4089.02s]  Uh-oh.
[4089.02s -> 4091.78s]  Gipped in and out.
[4091.78s -> 4093.69s]  Temperature check.
[4093.69s -> 4095.09s]  Temperature check.
[4095.13s -> 4096.49s]  EMF, storm blue.
[4096.49s -> 4097.69s]  We're fine.
[4097.69s -> 4098.53s]  10.
[4098.53s -> 4099.37s]  What's that?
[4099.37s -> 4100.65s]  That's thunder, that's thunder.
[4100.65s -> 4101.49s]  That's thunder.
[4104.30s -> 4108.54s]  I was gonna hold the cross out.
[4108.54s -> 4111.02s]  Remember to drop it if there's a spooky ghost.
[4111.02s -> 4112.98s]  Oh, actually, actually drop it on the ground?
[4112.98s -> 4114.10s]  You have to drop it on the ground.
[4114.10s -> 4116.10s]  Yeah, that's how I died before I didn't drop it.
[4116.10s -> 4116.94s]  Okay.
[4116.94s -> 4117.76s]  Yeah.
[4117.76s -> 4120.04s]  That's very good info.
[4120.04s -> 4121.88s]  This, this gotta be it.
[4122.72s -> 4124.32s]  This little room, come on.
[4124.32s -> 4125.16s]  Come on ghost.
[4125.16s -> 4126.80s]  That wood is mine.
[4126.80s -> 4128.36s]  What do you even store in here?
[4129.89s -> 4131.61s]  Ghosts.
[4131.61s -> 4133.57s]  Yeah, exactly. As soon as you're getting attacked,
[4133.57s -> 4134.73s]  whoever has the smudge sticks,
[4134.73s -> 4135.81s]  as soon as you're getting attacked,
[4135.81s -> 4138.61s]  just immediately pull out the smudge stick and smudge.
[4138.61s -> 4139.53s]  No matter what happens.
[4139.53s -> 4140.49s]  We're locked in.
[4140.49s -> 4141.33s]  We're locked in.
[4142.37s -> 4143.21s]  Oh, we're locked in.
[4143.21s -> 4144.05s]  We're locked in. Are you sure?
[4144.05s -> 4144.89s]  I am. Are you sure it's locked in?
[4144.89s -> 4145.89s]  We're locked in. Pull it back.
[4145.89s -> 4146.93s]  Pull it back.
[4146.93s -> 4149.31s]  No. There you go.
[4149.31s -> 4151.15s]  Whoa, whoa, funny door.
[4151.15s -> 4151.99s]  Ah, yeah.
[4151.99s -> 4157.34s]  There's some funny doors in this game.
[4157.34s -> 4159.10s]  This door opens too.
[4159.10s -> 4160.22s]  I just don't need to be here.
[4160.22s -> 4161.42s]  The fourth person here,
[4161.42s -> 4163.22s]  and I just don't know how to open a door.
[4163.22s -> 4164.06s]  I'm like, we're locked in.
[4164.06s -> 4164.88s]  We're locked in.
[4164.88s -> 4165.72s]  It's like, no, you just didn't open it.
[4165.72s -> 4168.34s]  It's push, not pull.
[4168.34s -> 4170.50s]  Yo, there's gherkins in here.
[4170.50s -> 4171.90s]  Oh shit.
[4171.90s -> 4174.10s]  No ghosts, but gherkins.
[4174.10s -> 4175.70s]  Dropping the flashlight
[4175.70s -> 4177.78s]  when the thunder hits is like perfect.
[4181.05s -> 4186.66s]  Zoinks.
[4186.66s -> 4187.86s]  What the fuck is that noise?
[4187.86s -> 4189.50s]  What is this door?
[4189.50s -> 4191.06s]  It's too big.
[4191.06s -> 4192.58s]  Vinny's brushing his teeth right now.
[4192.58s -> 4195.02s]  He said he was gonna brush his teeth for a minute.
[4195.02s -> 4197.02s]  Weep, weep, weep, weep.
[4199.71s -> 4202.11s]  Is there even a ghost in this whole place?
[4202.11s -> 4202.95s]  Yeah.
[4202.95s -> 4203.77s]  Okay.
[4203.77s -> 4204.61s]  Is one of the options for nothing?
[4204.61s -> 4205.59s]  It feels like ours.
[4205.59s -> 4206.43s]  This is just, you know what it is?
[4206.43s -> 4207.87s]  Is there an option for no ghosts to go home?
[4207.87s -> 4208.71s]  Yeah, yeah.
[4208.71s -> 4210.99s]  It's the scariest of all the Phasmophobia maps
[4210.99s -> 4212.95s]  because this is just real life.
[4212.95s -> 4214.74s]  Yeah.
[4214.74s -> 4216.98s]  I think the ghost is a gas leak.
[4216.98s -> 4219.30s]  Do you smell bark, ghost?
[4222.88s -> 4225.88s]  It's just, that's the sound we're hearing.
[4225.88s -> 4227.88s]  Ghost, give us a sign.
[4227.88s -> 4230.48s]  Carbon monoxide alarms failed us.
[4230.52s -> 4232.44s]  Yeah, oh, I think I can smell the ghost, guys.
[4232.44s -> 4234.20s]  I think I can smell it like sulfur.
[4237.90s -> 4240.87s]  There's a small pencil on the couch.
[4240.87s -> 4241.97s]  No ghosts, but.
[4246.80s -> 4247.64s]  Where is this?
[4247.64s -> 4249.80s]  Is there like a ghost that doesn't come out
[4249.80s -> 4251.64s]  and they kind of hide and we have to do something?
[4251.64s -> 4253.92s]  Yeah, there is a ghost that's shy.
[4253.92s -> 4256.04s]  Oh, and you have to split up, right?
[4256.04s -> 4257.92s]  Yeah, that could be it.
[4257.92s -> 4259.93s]  All right.
[4259.93s -> 4261.85s]  But we need to, we don't have any readings,
[4261.85s -> 4263.53s]  so we have nothing to go off of.
[4263.93s -> 4265.13s]  Yeah, we don't, yeah.
[4266.25s -> 4268.37s]  I was gonna say, I'll volunteer as bait
[4268.37s -> 4270.33s]  for the ghost if you want.
[4270.33s -> 4271.17s]  Okay.
[4271.17s -> 4272.73s]  It did work well last time.
[4276.83s -> 4279.31s]  Well, have we been down here?
[4282.54s -> 4283.78s]  Oh, yeah, that's right.
[4283.78s -> 4286.52s]  How would it not be in this room?
[4286.52s -> 4288.84s]  I guess we went through a giant circle.
[4288.84s -> 4290.96s]  This room is like the I am a ghost.
[4290.96s -> 4292.68s]  We're heading back to the truck.
[4292.68s -> 4294.02s]  Uh-oh.
[4294.02s -> 4295.22s]  We're heading back to the truck if you wanna.
[4295.22s -> 4296.06s]  Oh, okay, I'm coming.
[4296.06s -> 4298.76s]  I'll guide you, where are you?
[4298.76s -> 4301.30s]  Okay, good.
[4301.30s -> 4304.50s]  I didn't want you to get lost again.
[4304.50s -> 4306.62s]  Do we have any cameras or anything?
[4306.62s -> 4310.14s]  We do, we just, there's no reason to set it up
[4310.14s -> 4312.82s]  if we have no idea where it is.
[4312.82s -> 4313.82s]  All right, let's, let's.
[4313.82s -> 4318.34s]  We had a board brush for the ghost.
[4318.34s -> 4319.66s]  Oh, what?
[4319.66s -> 4320.86s]  Yeah, we're at zero sanity.
[4320.86s -> 4321.70s]  What?
[4321.70s -> 4323.74s]  There's activity at 10.
[4323.74s -> 4325.14s]  What?
[4325.14s -> 4325.98s]  What happened?
[4325.98s -> 4328.18s]  The half reader didn't do anything.
[4328.18s -> 4329.90s]  We just all went crazy in there.
[4329.90s -> 4330.94s]  We are all apparently insane,
[4330.94s -> 4338.47s]  but I mean, I don't feel any different.
[4338.47s -> 4340.79s]  Should we just take pills?
[4340.79s -> 4342.07s]  I guess we should.
[4342.07s -> 4345.47s]  Well, it was so probably haunted you guys.
[4345.47s -> 4348.31s]  I guess I'm taking a fucking pill then, all right.
[4349.27s -> 4353.18s]  So this activity you said at 10.
[4353.18s -> 4355.10s]  Yeah, it said the activity was at 10,
[4355.10s -> 4356.58s]  like so soon, right here.
[4356.58s -> 4358.74s]  Somebody said we should check downstairs.
[4358.74s -> 4361.78s]  So we were probably on the verge of potting.
[4361.78s -> 4363.30s]  Okay, we were right there.
[4364.30s -> 4368.35s]  I just spilled coffee all over me.
[4368.35s -> 4369.47s]  I could really use anything.
[4369.47s -> 4375.99s]  I don't care.
[4375.99s -> 4379.97s]  Is anybody there?
[4379.97s -> 4385.97s]  It's not that much.
[4385.97s -> 4389.79s]  Hello, is there anybody in there?
[4389.79s -> 4395.69s]  Spirit, show yourself.
[4395.69s -> 4398.45s]  We should just lure it out with mean words.
[4398.45s -> 4400.37s]  I mean, we've been down this hallway.
[4400.37s -> 4401.21s]  We need to go down.
[4401.21s -> 4403.33s]  Let me go back to the church
[4403.33s -> 4405.49s]  and I'll just like separate from you.
[4405.49s -> 4407.57s]  Wait, that's a terrible idea.
[4408.13s -> 4410.49s]  We got to go in twos.
[4410.49s -> 4411.33s]  We got to do twos.
[4411.33s -> 4413.25s]  Yeah, we'll pretend to not be in there.
[4413.25s -> 4415.86s]  Yeah.
[4415.86s -> 4418.50s]  So if you like shut the door, maybe.
[4418.50s -> 4420.50s]  You guys didn't try to pull on the basement door,
[4420.50s -> 4422.97s]  says a chat member.
[4422.97s -> 4424.53s]  We didn't pull on the basement door.
[4424.53s -> 4425.93s]  There's a basement door?
[4427.82s -> 4429.46s]  Where are those stairs?
[4433.06s -> 4440.12s]  That lightning was closer.
[4440.12s -> 4442.16s]  So where's this basement door that we're,
[4442.16s -> 4446.14s]  oh, oh, oh, basement door is open.
[4446.14s -> 4446.98s]  Okay.
[4447.02s -> 4448.06s]  I'm.
[4448.06s -> 4448.90s]  You all right, Vinny?
[4448.90s -> 4450.94s]  I'm fairly sure we went down here earlier.
[4450.94s -> 4452.14s]  Oh, fuck.
[4452.14s -> 4453.67s]  We did.
[4453.67s -> 4455.07s]  Did we already go down here?
[4455.07s -> 4455.91s]  Yeah, we did.
[4455.91s -> 4456.75s]  We did.
[4456.75s -> 4457.59s]  Yeah.
[4457.59s -> 4458.43s]  The mattress at the bottom.
[4458.43s -> 4464.06s]  Shit.
[4464.06s -> 4466.02s]  It's not the room?
[4466.02s -> 4468.38s]  I'm starting to think that this was an elaborate scheme
[4468.38s -> 4470.06s]  by somebody to tell us to all be here
[4470.06s -> 4471.22s]  and yeah, go find the ghost
[4471.22s -> 4472.94s]  while they rob all of our houses.
[4475.22s -> 4485.84s]  Like, we're just here.
[4485.84s -> 4492.86s]  I have no idea.
[4492.86s -> 4494.38s]  What funny door.
[4494.38s -> 4496.38s]  You don't see it, do you?
[4496.46s -> 4499.70s]  If you pull on it, Liam, pull on the door in VR.
[4499.70s -> 4501.39s]  Okay.
[4501.39s -> 4502.83s]  Tell me if you can make it a funny door.
[4502.83s -> 4504.03s]  You got it?
[4504.03s -> 4505.03s]  It extends.
[4506.27s -> 4507.27s]  No way.
[4507.27s -> 4508.11s]  Oh my God.
[4508.91s -> 4509.75s]  Wait, what?
[4509.75s -> 4510.59s]  What?
[4510.59s -> 4511.43s]  There's a funny door.
[4511.43s -> 4514.27s]  Holy shit, this is the biggest door of all time.
[4514.27s -> 4516.67s]  Can you guys pull on the door backwards?
[4516.67s -> 4518.35s]  Like pull from the edge back?
[4518.35s -> 4520.19s]  Oh my God.
[4520.19s -> 4523.38s]  I just turned it into a wall.
[4523.38s -> 4524.66s]  Oh my God.
[4524.70s -> 4528.30s]  Every time someone uses the door, it gets bigger.
[4528.30s -> 4529.18s]  Yeah, it's huge.
[4529.18s -> 4530.58s]  It's at the ceiling for me almost.
[4530.58s -> 4532.38s]  I'm gonna load up your stream.
[4532.38s -> 4534.06s]  Oh my God, what the?
[4534.06s -> 4534.90s]  What?
[4534.90s -> 4535.74s]  Dude, what?
[4537.06s -> 4538.22s]  Is it funny?
[4538.22s -> 4539.06s]  This is better than the ghost.
[4539.06s -> 4539.90s]  It's like someone's gonna use
[4539.90s -> 4541.78s]  the free transform tool on the door.
[4545.70s -> 4548.46s]  Maybe the ghost is inhabiting this door.
[4548.46s -> 4549.30s]  Maybe this is what it is.
[4549.30s -> 4550.58s]  Is that in the evidence, giant door?
[4550.58s -> 4553.62s]  Can we, yeah, put the ghost as door?
[4556.05s -> 4557.17s]  Oops, can I pick that back up?
[4557.17s -> 4558.01s]  Okay.
[4560.06s -> 4560.98s]  The door is now.
[4560.98s -> 4563.38s]  It is 10 point, what did the game,
[4563.38s -> 4564.46s]  did we get locked somehow
[4564.46s -> 4568.42s]  and the ghost just didn't spawn in here?
[4568.42s -> 4569.82s]  This door is now broken for me.
[4569.82s -> 4570.98s]  I can't actually grab it.
[4570.98s -> 4571.82s]  Okay, here, let me try.
[4571.82s -> 4572.82s]  Yeah, neither can I.
[4574.50s -> 4576.46s]  I think we're in trouble here then.
[4577.66s -> 4580.90s]  Yeah, the door's, yeah, the door broke.
[4580.90s -> 4581.74s]  Oh, I got it.
[4581.74s -> 4582.58s]  There you go.
[4582.58s -> 4583.42s]  You got it.
[4583.42s -> 4584.26s]  Oh my God.
[4584.26s -> 4586.74s]  I have to maneuver around the door.
[4586.74s -> 4587.82s]  Do I spin like this?
[4587.82s -> 4590.29s]  Does the door look silly?
[4590.29s -> 4593.09s]  Oh, oh, it's gittering.
[4593.09s -> 4595.21s]  It's got collision too, all the way through.
[4595.21s -> 4596.25s]  Yeah, oh my.
[4596.25s -> 4615.44s]  The more collision it has.
[4615.44s -> 4618.48s]  Jerma?
[4618.48s -> 4619.32s]  Yeah.
[4619.32s -> 4620.16s]  Yep, I copy.
[4620.16s -> 4621.68s]  Where am I?
[4621.68s -> 4625.70s]  Where are you, Jerma?
[4625.70s -> 4626.66s]  Actually, help me.
[4626.66s -> 4631.80s]  I actually, help, help, help, help, help, help me.
[4631.80s -> 4633.28s]  Help, actually help.
[4633.28s -> 4634.12s]  Are you behind this door?
[4634.12s -> 4635.96s]  I'm behind that door.
[4635.96s -> 4639.24s]  Okay, I can't open it.
[4639.24s -> 4641.38s]  Why is the door locked now?
[4642.38s -> 4643.53s]  I don't know.
[4643.53s -> 4647.84s]  You could try the other door to get into, yeah.
[4647.84s -> 4648.68s]  It's right here.
[4648.68s -> 4649.52s]  Help me.
[4649.52s -> 4650.36s]  Open the door.
[4650.36s -> 4651.20s]  Open it, open it, open it.
[4651.20s -> 4652.04s]  Open it.
[4656.90s -> 4657.74s]  Where, where are you?
[4657.74s -> 4658.58s]  Where was this?
[4665.34s -> 4666.50s]  What the fuck?
[4675.15s -> 4676.43s]  I was, okay.
[4676.43s -> 4678.83s]  I did the, everyone that says
[4678.83s -> 4680.79s]  that I would never do the thing that happens
[4680.79s -> 4683.15s]  in movies, right?
[4683.15s -> 4685.43s]  Where, oh no, I'm trying the door.
[4685.43s -> 4688.67s]  I'm pulling, I'm yanking on the fucking door
[4688.67s -> 4690.31s]  and it's closed and I can't open it.
[4690.31s -> 4692.39s]  Everyone says I would never do that, right?
[4692.39s -> 4695.19s]  You've got three seconds to get away from that thing.
[4695.19s -> 4696.35s]  I did that thing.
[4696.35s -> 4697.91s]  I went for the handle and I tried to grip it
[4697.91s -> 4699.59s]  and I pulled as hard as I fucking could.
[4699.59s -> 4702.69s]  I should have just sprinted.
[4702.69s -> 4705.29s]  I should have sprinted the fuck away.
[4705.29s -> 4706.25s]  And yes, I understand.
[4706.25s -> 4708.37s]  I realize I'm in a family guy death pose.
[4708.37s -> 4710.25s]  I get it, I understand.
[4710.25s -> 4711.09s]  It's funny.
[4719.30s -> 4722.98s]  Well, at least I pulled the ghost into aggro.
[4722.98s -> 4726.10s]  I'm happy about this.
[4726.10s -> 4727.94s]  I recommend, we need to be careful what we say
[4727.94s -> 4737.86s]  because the ghost will know if we're going to be some kind.
[4737.86s -> 4740.26s]  All right, can I see the ghost now that I'm dead?
[4741.54s -> 4743.22s]  Same as family guy death.
[4743.22s -> 4748.06s]  It's been better than I thought.
[4748.06s -> 4750.42s]  Oh my god, how beautiful.
[4750.42s -> 4751.86s]  Oh my god.
[4751.86s -> 4753.32s]  Oh my god.
[4753.32s -> 4754.32s]  Oh, holy shit.
[4754.32s -> 4755.16s]  Holy shit.
[4755.16s -> 4756.52s]  It's definitely falling easy.
[4756.52s -> 4758.68s]  All I can hear is just muffled Peter Griffin
[4758.68s -> 4759.52s]  and impressions.
[4763.06s -> 4764.30s]  Holy crap, Lois.
[4772.57s -> 4775.01s]  Your roommates are watching family guy.
[4778.13s -> 4780.41s]  Oh, that's, what the fuck?
[4788.91s -> 4792.32s]  I could have pulled the door off.
[4792.32s -> 4794.04s]  Wait, I could have pulled the door off
[4794.04s -> 4795.44s]  and just walked away.
[4799.36s -> 4800.56s]  You got to be shitting me.
[4815.94s -> 4817.42s]  I wonder who she's coming for.
[4825.86s -> 4826.70s]  Who's screaming?
[4842.78s -> 4844.34s]  She's right there, she's coming.
[4849.54s -> 4851.39s]  What?
[4851.39s -> 4853.08s]  Oh, it's you.
[4864.80s -> 4866.68s]  Give me, I need to fuck with them, right?
[4866.68s -> 4868.56s]  I need a, I need like a small plate.
[4880.22s -> 4887.94s]  I just stood behind Liam and let the,
[4887.94s -> 4889.06s]  Oh, hey, Jerma, what's up?
[4889.06s -> 4891.44s]  Hey, what's up?
[4891.44s -> 4892.68s]  I died a horrible death.
[4895.46s -> 4898.10s]  Yeah, that was, it's pretty rough.
[4898.10s -> 4900.50s]  Yeah, that's, they can do that when they die.
[4900.50s -> 4903.54s]  Oh no, they're telling us to check the book.
[4903.54s -> 4904.38s]  Okay.
[4906.28s -> 4907.64s]  So what did we have?
[4907.64s -> 4908.76s]  We had, did we have,
[4911.04s -> 4912.36s]  This is so funny.
[4912.36s -> 4916.83s]  Wait, pick up the book if they drew something.
[4916.99s -> 4917.83s]  Did they?
[4917.83s -> 4918.67s]  I don't think they did.
[4918.67s -> 4920.87s]  Okay, pick up the book if there were fingerprints.
[4920.87s -> 4923.11s]  I didn't see any, I had the thing, nevermind.
[4924.43s -> 4927.23s]  I just died and panicked, that's all that happened.
[4927.23s -> 4929.35s]  Yeah, you died in the Family Guy pose
[4929.35s -> 4930.71s]  and like your skull was caved in.
[4930.71s -> 4931.75s]  It was just terrible.
[4931.75s -> 4932.59s]  Really?
[4932.59s -> 4933.43s]  All around.
[4933.43s -> 4934.27s]  Yeah.
[4934.27s -> 4936.31s]  It was freezing.
[4936.31s -> 4937.15s]  There was no EMF level five.
[4937.15s -> 4937.99s]  Like we could see your teeth.
[4937.99s -> 4940.43s]  It was, it was gruesome.
[4940.43s -> 4944.63s]  They're waving a book at us, does that mean?
[4944.63s -> 4945.47s]  Do I have a book in my hand?
[4945.47s -> 4947.91s]  Obviously, this is probably just gonna be a guess.
[4948.15s -> 4949.71s]  Yeah, I didn't see any writing.
[4949.71s -> 4951.27s]  I don't even think it interacted with the candle.
[4951.27s -> 4952.91s]  I think, oh man.
[4952.91s -> 4954.44s]  Gym.
[4954.44s -> 4955.32s]  Gym?
[4955.32s -> 4956.20s]  Gym.
[4956.20s -> 4958.20s]  Oh, it says gin, I thought it said gym.
[4959.40s -> 4960.64s]  Wait, I thought it said gym too.
[4960.64s -> 4961.80s]  Oh, ghost orbs, let me,
[4961.80s -> 4963.76s]  let me symbol the ghost orb thing, hold on.
[4963.76s -> 4964.60s]  I can't pick this shit up.
[4964.60s -> 4966.80s]  Chat, how about this, chat, why don't,
[4966.80s -> 4969.00s]  based on what you've seen, do you have any guesses, chat?
[4969.00s -> 4969.84s]  Do you wanna do gym?
[4969.84s -> 4970.68s]  Chat.
[4970.68s -> 4971.52s]  How do I, how do I signal that?
[4971.52s -> 4972.48s]  What do you chat think?
[4972.48s -> 4974.16s]  I don't know, how do we, how do we show?
[4974.16s -> 4975.00s]  A lot of people say gym.
[4975.00s -> 4975.84s]  Yeah, move it around.
[4975.84s -> 4976.92s]  I'm just checking your chat now.
[4976.92s -> 4977.76s]  This thing, this thing, this thing,
[4978.24s -> 4979.56s]  floating around.
[4979.56s -> 4980.76s]  On the book.
[4980.76s -> 4982.84s]  It's all a prank by some guy named gym.
[4985.08s -> 4985.92s]  Did you see it?
[4989.86s -> 4991.78s]  Book might mean book evidence.
[4997.51s -> 4998.35s]  Please.
[5000.92s -> 5003.22s]  Just start pulling wires up from the computer.
[5003.22s -> 5004.06s]  Yeah.
[5004.06s -> 5005.02s]  Okay, they're, wait, they're, they're,
[5005.02s -> 5008.62s]  they're throwing a, I can't, a ball, a ball, a ball.
[5008.62s -> 5009.62s]  Oh, they're telling us to look at,
[5009.62s -> 5010.86s]  they're telling us to look at the camera.
[5010.86s -> 5012.94s]  Look, look, look, look, look, they.
[5012.94s -> 5013.78s]  The bell.
[5018.14s -> 5022.08s]  Why did that happen so many times?
[5022.08s -> 5023.92s]  I'm gonna go get another fucking weird object
[5023.92s -> 5029.04s]  that means nothing, hold on.
[5029.04s -> 5032.28s]  Oh, they brought a, they brought a bottle of ketchup.
[5032.28s -> 5036.64s]  I wonder what that means.
[5036.64s -> 5042.25s]  I'm gonna just keep throwing shit in here.
[5042.25s -> 5044.21s]  Look, you can hit the bell while they're holding it.
[5044.21s -> 5050.63s]  The Solonka returns.
[5058.17s -> 5059.01s]  Can I bring this plant?
[5059.01s -> 5064.01s]  No.
[5064.01s -> 5065.53s]  Was that like a pen?
[5065.53s -> 5071.27s]  What was I gonna pick up?
[5071.27s -> 5073.57s]  A clipboard?
[5073.57s -> 5080.48s]  Okay, yeah, a clipboard.
[5080.48s -> 5088.52s]  I think I'm lost.
[5088.52s -> 5089.36s]  But I guess.
[5089.36s -> 5091.04s]  Are you a clipboard?
[5091.04s -> 5092.36s]  Yeah, a clipboard, a clipboard.
[5092.36s -> 5093.20s]  Where did you find that?
[5093.20s -> 5094.04s]  I don't know.
[5094.04s -> 5094.88s]  Stay out here.
[5094.88s -> 5097.08s]  If I don't come back, you guess, I'll be in touch.
[5097.08s -> 5099.60s]  Do you want my headlight thing?
[5099.60s -> 5100.68s]  Yeah.
[5100.68s -> 5102.84s]  I actually have no idea how to take it off.
[5108.74s -> 5111.30s]  How do I do like a follow me this way, this way?
[5112.47s -> 5115.03s]  Just like throw in front of their face
[5115.03s -> 5117.67s]  and then drag it this way.
[5117.67s -> 5118.51s]  So.
[5118.51s -> 5120.23s]  Or like just shake it around and then.
[5120.23s -> 5122.11s]  Yeah, I'm gonna make like a little trail with it.
[5122.11s -> 5131.97s]  Why don't I, you take the camera.
[5131.97s -> 5134.13s]  I'm like trying to gesture them to come after you.
[5134.13s -> 5138.74s]  Yeah.
[5138.74s -> 5140.50s]  Don't do it, Vinny.
[5140.50s -> 5141.34s]  Take a smudge stick.
[5141.34s -> 5142.58s]  You know what?
[5142.58s -> 5146.06s]  Nope, since Jerma and Liam died,
[5146.06s -> 5147.98s]  I'm just gonna vote Gin.
[5147.98s -> 5148.98s]  I don't care.
[5148.98s -> 5149.82s]  Oh no.
[5149.82s -> 5150.66s]  Yeah, fuck it, let's go for Gin.
[5150.66s -> 5151.82s]  Screw it.
[5151.82s -> 5152.78s]  Worth a shot.
[5152.78s -> 5154.73s]  Wait, we get to go.
[5154.73s -> 5156.77s]  Oh, I forgot to vote Gin.
[5158.34s -> 5159.58s]  There we go.
[5159.58s -> 5160.90s]  We got nothing.
[5160.90s -> 5167.62s]  Do we not get it?
[5167.62s -> 5169.76s]  Do we get it?
[5169.76s -> 5170.60s]  Miling.
[5170.60s -> 5172.75s]  No.
[5172.75s -> 5173.99s]  Not Gin.
[5173.99s -> 5176.03s]  I got $20 for that.
[5176.03s -> 5177.63s]  I know, how are we supposed to make any money?
[5177.63s -> 5180.47s]  Single level or single dollar.
[5180.47s -> 5182.11s]  Oh my God.
[5182.11s -> 5184.15s]  I made 25 bucks an hour ago
[5184.15s -> 5186.82s]  and I don't know how it happened, but it did.
[5186.82s -> 5189.64s]  That map was just too big.
[5189.64s -> 5191.20s]  Maybe it's the difficulty we're on?
[5191.20s -> 5193.12s]  No, no, intermediate's fine.
[5197.62s -> 5198.94s]  Liam, are there any other levels
[5198.94s -> 5203.10s]  that are like mid to small sized that you have access to?
[5203.10s -> 5205.58s]  Yeah, can you access Tanglewood and Edgefield?
[5208.18s -> 5209.14s]  This game is cool.
[5213.88s -> 5214.72s]  Is there a hoop?
[5216.35s -> 5217.79s]  Yeah, actually up here.
[5217.79s -> 5219.23s]  Is there?
[5219.23s -> 5220.07s]  Right here.
[5222.23s -> 5223.75s]  Oh, okay, that's blending in for me.
[5223.75s -> 5224.59s]  All right.
[5224.59s -> 5225.43s]  Maybe that's too small, but that's all right.
[5225.43s -> 5227.23s]  That's not very well-interesting.
[5227.23s -> 5229.03s]  I guess we wanna feel some success today.
[5229.03s -> 5230.03s]  Wait.
[5230.03s -> 5230.87s]  No.
[5230.87s -> 5231.71s]  Oh.
[5233.75s -> 5236.37s]  Yeah, I don't at least make Jerma fuck
[5237.05s -> 5237.89s]  more than five bucks.
[5237.89s -> 5238.73s]  Yeah.
[5238.73s -> 5239.57s]  That's my goal.
[5240.65s -> 5241.49s]  No, I'm good.
[5241.49s -> 5242.33s]  It's fine.
[5242.33s -> 5245.53s]  It's fun just to kind of walk around and be scared.
[5245.53s -> 5247.93s]  Look at the twins playing basketball over there.
[5247.93s -> 5249.41s]  That's so pleasant.
[5249.41s -> 5250.53s]  The Zuckerbergs.
[5255.58s -> 5257.54s]  Oh shit, I gotta add my equipment.
[5257.54s -> 5261.15s]  I gotta, I gotta, I got it in.
[5261.15s -> 5261.99s]  You got it in?
[5261.99s -> 5262.83s]  All this equipment is still here.
[5262.83s -> 5263.67s]  Yeah, I got it in.
[5263.67s -> 5264.83s]  That's a win for me.
[5264.83s -> 5266.67s]  Hold on, I have to do it now.
[5266.67s -> 5267.51s]  Oh, cause I died.
[5268.51s -> 5280.72s]  Let's just bounce back and hang me in the face.
[5280.72s -> 5283.44s]  See, yeah, they, the UI on how this works.
[5283.44s -> 5286.24s]  So I'm like a little confused, but it'll be.
[5286.24s -> 5288.76s]  I don't like that they changed it to this.
[5288.76s -> 5289.84s]  I don't get it.
[5289.84s -> 5292.62s]  It was weird at first.
[5292.62s -> 5294.14s]  What, they did like a big UI update?
[5294.14s -> 5295.14s]  $15.
[5295.14s -> 5295.98s]  Yeah.
[5298.78s -> 5300.26s]  I mean, it looks nicer, but.
[5300.26s -> 5303.18s]  Have you guys played the Village DLC?
[5303.18s -> 5304.02s]  Not yet.
[5304.02s -> 5304.86s]  No, not yet.
[5304.86s -> 5306.73s]  It's good.
[5306.73s -> 5309.29s]  Are you still playing Splatoon?
[5310.21s -> 5311.05s]  Yeah.
[5311.05s -> 5312.41s]  You want to play Splatoon one of these days?
[5312.41s -> 5313.97s]  You want to do the salmon thing?
[5313.97s -> 5314.85s]  Salmon run?
[5314.85s -> 5315.97s]  Yeah, I'm down.
[5315.97s -> 5317.53s]  I love salmon run and play that.
[5317.53s -> 5319.65s]  That's pretty much all I play on that game now.
[5319.65s -> 5322.40s]  Except for maybe some rank.
[5322.40s -> 5323.92s]  It's such a fun PvE mode.
[5323.92s -> 5326.48s]  I got really addicted to that for a while.
[5326.48s -> 5327.64s]  So yeah, I'm down.
[5327.64s -> 5328.48s]  I'll play.
[5328.48s -> 5331.72s]  I slept on Splatoon for, since the first came out.
[5331.72s -> 5334.13s]  First one.
[5334.13s -> 5337.13s]  I did not think it was as intricate and fun as it was.
[5337.13s -> 5338.41s]  It is, yeah, it's great.
[5338.41s -> 5340.05s]  I mean, it, but it evolved too.
[5340.09s -> 5341.13s]  The first one was good,
[5341.13s -> 5343.49s]  but now it's like the best it's ever been, so.
[5343.49s -> 5344.33s]  I think you know what the big,
[5344.33s -> 5345.97s]  the huge turnoff for me was?
[5345.97s -> 5348.33s]  That first game being on the Wii U,
[5348.33s -> 5352.77s]  and like I, it's just that big brick console in your hand,
[5352.77s -> 5358.71s]  and the gyroscope, I don't know, it wasn't for me.
[5358.91s -> 5361.23s]  Well, the gyro is definitely way more manageable
[5361.23s -> 5362.51s]  on an actual controller,
[5362.51s -> 5365.03s]  rather than the Fisher Price game pad they gave you.
[5366.64s -> 5367.88s]  Hey guys.
[5367.88s -> 5368.72s]  Yeah.
[5368.72s -> 5371.20s]  That door over there, can you go and press that door?
[5372.16s -> 5373.00s]  Press it?
[5373.84s -> 5375.26s]  Yeah.
[5375.26s -> 5376.10s]  What the?
[5382.32s -> 5383.32s]  Who are the other people in the lobby?
[5383.32s -> 5384.36s]  Did we invite some people?
[5384.36s -> 5385.36s]  People join off you?
[5387.49s -> 5388.93s]  Chad said go in the center.
[5388.93s -> 5390.53s]  What are you, Chad?
[5390.53s -> 5392.01s]  Use a black light.
[5392.01s -> 5394.29s]  Use a black light on the inner circle.
[5394.29s -> 5395.13s]  We have a black light.
[5395.13s -> 5396.13s]  My name is Jeremy, what's up, man?
[5396.13s -> 5397.77s]  What's your, what's your channel?
[5397.77s -> 5399.09s]  What's your Twitch channel?
[5400.98s -> 5403.43s]  I think your mic is messed up, man.
[5403.43s -> 5404.91s]  Who invited, are these friends?
[5404.91s -> 5409.31s]  Yeah.
[5409.31s -> 5411.29s]  Behind the counter.
[5411.81s -> 5412.85s]  Oh, oh, oh, hang on, hang on, guys.
[5412.85s -> 5416.74s]  There's a little thing that we have to do here, hang on.
[5416.74s -> 5419.69s]  All right, here, look.
[5419.69s -> 5420.53s]  Oh.
[5420.53s -> 5421.37s]  It's gonna get weird,
[5421.37s -> 5422.49s]  because we're all gonna be talking at the same time,
[5422.49s -> 5425.09s]  so I mean, can you guys mute your microphones
[5425.09s -> 5429.09s]  so our streams don't, I know we're like all.
[5429.09s -> 5430.57s]  There's too many people in this lobby, sorry.
[5430.57s -> 5432.09s]  Yeah, I mean, it's gonna be weird.
[5432.09s -> 5433.05s]  Oh.
[5433.05s -> 5433.89s]  Maybe we could split it off
[5433.89s -> 5435.49s]  into two different discords or something.
[5435.49s -> 5439.42s]  It's gonna be kind of weird.
[5439.42s -> 5440.78s]  What's that?
[5440.78s -> 5441.62s]  They're dead now.
[5441.62s -> 5444.42s]  If you stand here, did they do the thing for you?
[5444.50s -> 5445.34s]  What thing?
[5445.34s -> 5446.18s]  Wait, wait, what is happening?
[5446.18s -> 5447.02s]  What is happening?
[5447.02s -> 5447.84s]  What is happening?
[5447.84s -> 5448.68s]  Oh no, what?
[5448.68s -> 5449.52s]  What?
[5449.52s -> 5450.34s]  What?
[5450.34s -> 5451.18s]  No.
[5451.18s -> 5452.02s]  They became come on the floor, what's happening?
[5452.02s -> 5452.86s]  That's what I was thinking.
[5452.86s -> 5454.22s]  I didn't want to say it out loud.
[5455.22s -> 5457.54s]  Nothing's happening.
[5457.54s -> 5459.26s]  Oh.
[5459.26s -> 5463.06s]  Hey, dude, one of you guys turn your TV down
[5463.06s -> 5464.54s]  as he's coming to the mic, one of you guys.
[5464.54s -> 5466.54s]  They left, they all disconnected.
[5466.54s -> 5468.30s]  Yeah, they DC'd.
[5468.30s -> 5469.30s]  It's all right, it's for the best.
[5469.30s -> 5470.58s]  We don't like them anyway.
[5470.58s -> 5471.58s]  It'd probably be hard to do that anyways.
[5471.58s -> 5473.58s]  We'll just do this map.
[5473.58s -> 5474.58s]  All right, let's ready up.
[5474.74s -> 5476.62s]  I'm confident this time.
[5476.62s -> 5477.46s]  We'll get it.
[5477.46s -> 5480.10s]  I mean, I'm down to play another like half hour.
[5480.10s -> 5481.74s]  Is that cool guys?
[5481.74s -> 5484.62s]  Yeah, then I'll have to hop off anyway.
[5484.62s -> 5487.08s]  Okay, so we'll definitely get the.
[5490.75s -> 5492.19s]  That's like the kind of like,
[5492.19s -> 5494.75s]  you got to back away from the TV.
[5494.75s -> 5497.87s]  Both hands up, face into the television.
[5499.18s -> 5502.46s]  That was, you were too close.
[5502.46s -> 5503.42s]  Okay, smudge stick,
[5503.42s -> 5506.26s]  and we have to have a ghost walk through salt.
[5506.26s -> 5507.89s]  Okay.
[5507.89s -> 5509.89s]  German's on smudge stick duty again.
[5509.89s -> 5511.68s]  That sounds good.
[5511.68s -> 5513.58s]  I can take EMF again.
[5513.58s -> 5515.52s]  We don't have enough flashlights.
[5515.52s -> 5516.92s]  I don't think.
[5516.92s -> 5517.76s]  Wait, really?
[5519.00s -> 5521.46s]  Oh boy.
[5521.46s -> 5522.30s]  That's all right.
[5522.30s -> 5523.34s]  That's just peachy.
[5523.34s -> 5524.34s]  Hey, there's, I'll tell you what,
[5524.34s -> 5526.66s]  I'll use the black light.
[5526.66s -> 5528.18s]  So who wants this extra flashlight?
[5528.18s -> 5529.66s]  It's right here.
[5529.66s -> 5530.66s]  It's.
[5530.66s -> 5532.02s]  I'll take it.
[5532.02s -> 5534.98s]  All right, hang on, I'll put it back up here.
[5534.98s -> 5536.06s]  Did we have an EMF?
[5536.94s -> 5537.78s]  Yep.
[5537.78s -> 5539.00s]  Yes, perfect.
[5539.00s -> 5541.76s]  I got lighter smudge stick flashlight.
[5541.76s -> 5544.60s]  I got salt, I got black light,
[5544.60s -> 5546.40s]  and I'll bring. Do you have a lighter, German?
[5546.40s -> 5547.48s]  Yep.
[5547.48s -> 5548.32s]  Okay, I think we're all set.
[5548.32s -> 5550.44s]  I'll bring a spirit box.
[5550.44s -> 5552.12s]  I'll bring the sound thing. Oh, you are?
[5552.12s -> 5552.96s]  Yeah.
[5552.96s -> 5554.00s]  If you're bringing spirit box.
[5554.00s -> 5556.36s]  I've got EMF and spirit box.
[5556.36s -> 5558.16s]  Oh, do we have a thermometer or did I?
[5558.16s -> 5559.68s]  No, I don't think we have one.
[5559.68s -> 5561.32s]  I don't think so.
[5561.32s -> 5562.52s]  Okay, that's fine.
[5562.52s -> 5564.48s]  That's just one equipment, that's fine.
[5565.60s -> 5568.00s]  All right, well, I'm gonna take a journal, man.
[5568.00s -> 5568.84s]  What's this key for?
[5569.76s -> 5571.84s]  What's this thing?
[5571.84s -> 5573.60s]  That's the key to the house, yeah.
[5573.60s -> 5574.60s]  Oh, okay.
[5574.60s -> 5576.79s]  Oh.
[5576.79s -> 5579.31s]  So remember, we have to have a ghost walk through salt
[5579.31s -> 5580.71s]  and we have to use the smudge stick
[5580.71s -> 5583.03s]  when the ghost is chasing one of us.
[5583.03s -> 5585.39s]  Okay, wait, isn't this the baby level?
[5585.39s -> 5586.23s]  This is the baby level?
[5586.23s -> 5587.07s]  We need a win.
[5587.07s -> 5588.07s]  We need a win.
[5588.07s -> 5592.11s]  We need a win, we need a win, we need a win.
[5592.11s -> 5593.51s]  Okay, yeah, I remember this.
[5594.99s -> 5597.79s]  This level I've played a million times, we'll be fine.
[5597.79s -> 5598.83s]  All right, cool.
[5598.83s -> 5601.75s]  I say confidently, knowing that I'll probably die first.
[5604.05s -> 5606.32s]  All right.
[5606.32s -> 5608.52s]  I'm gonna make a pickle sandwich if anyone knows one.
[5608.52s -> 5609.88s]  Ghost, are you in here?
[5609.88s -> 5611.48s]  Pickle and peanut butter.
[5611.48s -> 5612.64s]  Ghost, how old are you?
[5613.95s -> 5619.71s]  What is your name?
[5619.71s -> 5621.39s]  Getting ratings over here, guys.
[5621.39s -> 5622.59s]  There's four knobs here.
[5622.59s -> 5624.27s]  I don't know what this ghost detector is,
[5624.27s -> 5626.29s]  but somebody can read that, maybe?
[5626.29s -> 5627.43s]  Can you read it?
[5627.43s -> 5628.96s]  I'm over here.
[5628.96s -> 5631.00s]  There's a ghost detecting machine over here.
[5631.00s -> 5634.14s]  It's got four nodules on it.
[5634.14s -> 5636.60s]  I'm just trying to figure out what it is.
[5636.60s -> 5640.60s]  Can anybody read what that says?
[5640.60s -> 5642.93s]  It says gullible.
[5642.93s -> 5644.76s]  It does?
[5644.76s -> 5645.76s]  It doesn't say that.
[5652.76s -> 5653.92s]  Pencil crayons, neat.
[5656.34s -> 5657.18s]  This is a small house.
[5657.18s -> 5658.38s]  All right.
[5658.38s -> 5660.26s]  There's a chat member that said if we do this,
[5660.26s -> 5661.70s]  he'll subscribe to my channel.
[5661.70s -> 5662.54s]  Really?
[5662.54s -> 5663.66s]  All right, let's do it.
[5663.66s -> 5664.78s]  We gotta do this.
[5664.78s -> 5666.30s]  It's on the line now.
[5678.95s -> 5680.35s]  Spirit, I'm not the ghost,
[5680.35s -> 5685.30s]  but I have to say the spirit temple is more fun.
[5685.30s -> 5686.86s]  Spirit temple.
[5687.48s -> 5689.76s]  Honestly, that's kind of a tough one for me.
[5689.76s -> 5691.40s]  I don't even know what they're talking about.
[5693.72s -> 5695.80s]  Oh, you guys can hear me.
[5695.80s -> 5697.36s]  I thought I was far enough away.
[5705.68s -> 5707.52s]  Bartholomew.
[5707.52s -> 5710.12s]  Nancy.
[5710.12s -> 5711.73s]  Nancy.
[5711.73s -> 5713.13s]  Nancy.
[5713.13s -> 5714.45s]  Okay.
[5714.45s -> 5715.77s]  Ghost, are you Nancy?
[5722.91s -> 5723.75s]  Okay.
[5723.75s -> 5725.67s]  Why is this computer so big?
[5725.67s -> 5727.07s]  It is huge, isn't it?
[5727.07s -> 5729.75s]  Like, that's a comically oversized computer.
[5729.75s -> 5730.87s]  Speaking of, let me see if I can make
[5731.67s -> 5732.51s]  these doors bigger.
[5732.51s -> 5734.40s]  No.
[5734.40s -> 5737.24s]  That's a big tower.
[5737.24s -> 5739.68s]  Well, you can fit a 4080 in there comfortably.
[5739.68s -> 5740.80s]  It might just explode,
[5740.80s -> 5744.68s]  but the connectors might burn up before it explodes,
[5744.68s -> 5746.64s]  so you might get lucky.
[5746.64s -> 5749.40s]  Yeah, you might get some gaming in before then.
[5749.40s -> 5751.24s]  Level two matches on Call of Duty.
[5755.56s -> 5756.60s]  Nope, Nancy.
[5757.60s -> 5758.68s]  There's a basement, by the way.
[5758.68s -> 5759.52s]  They might be down there.
[5759.52s -> 5761.22s]  Oh, there's a basement.
[5761.22s -> 5764.07s]  Oh, they're definitely in the basement.
[5764.07s -> 5765.31s]  Where we access that basement?
[5765.31s -> 5766.59s]  Over here, I think.
[5766.59s -> 5768.31s]  Yeah, it's here to the left.
[5768.31s -> 5769.91s]  I'm ready with a smudge stick,
[5769.91s -> 5771.19s]  if you want me to use it.
[5777.67s -> 5780.84s]  Don't touch that, you'll get electrocuted.
[5780.84s -> 5782.46s]  What is this?
[5782.46s -> 5784.66s]  Oh, that's for catching flies, I think.
[5784.66s -> 5787.74s]  Oh, I thought, honestly, this is insane to say,
[5787.74s -> 5789.62s]  but I thought this was the ghost,
[5789.62s -> 5791.90s]  like baiting somebody to come pick this up,
[5791.90s -> 5793.70s]  like they're, like, I'm gonna grab this.
[5793.70s -> 5794.86s]  Like, carry it on a stick.
[5794.86s -> 5796.46s]  It's like tomato soup or something,
[5796.46s -> 5797.90s]  like, oh, tomato soup, and I'd pick it up,
[5797.90s -> 5798.74s]  and they would be like,
[5798.78s -> 5800.34s]  oh, it would pull us up or something.
[5800.34s -> 5802.74s]  I thought this was, like, a thing the ghost was doing.
[5804.92s -> 5808.19s]  Well, I mean, no.
[5808.19s -> 5809.03s]  That's gross.
[5809.99s -> 5810.87s]  Yeah, it's kind of nasty.
[5810.87s -> 5813.57s]  How long has this been up here?
[5813.57s -> 5817.00s]  How did this many flies get in the basement?
[5817.00s -> 5821.70s]  Not even a window down here.
[5821.70s -> 5826.31s]  Bridge, anything in here?
[5826.31s -> 5827.71s]  No, no, nothing, no.
[5827.71s -> 5829.23s]  Oh, what's up?
[5829.23s -> 5830.07s]  You all right?
[5832.36s -> 5839.96s]  Minnie, Minnie?
[5839.96s -> 5840.80s]  What?
[5840.80s -> 5841.64s]  I don't know, nothing happened.
[5842.40s -> 5846.72s]  You just made, like, a Five Nights at Freddy's scream sound.
[5846.72s -> 5851.24s]  No, a little bit, maybe.
[5851.24s -> 5854.09s]  By the way, what a franchise.
[5854.09s -> 5856.20s]  Right?
[5856.20s -> 5858.52s]  Aren't they making a TV show starring Henry Cavill
[5858.52s -> 5860.84s]  since he's no longer on The Witcher?
[5860.84s -> 5862.24s]  He's no longer on The Witcher?
[5862.24s -> 5864.68s]  Uh, Liam Hemsworth.
[5864.68s -> 5866.60s]  Your namesake is replacing him.
[5868.41s -> 5869.41s]  Where's this ghost?
[5873.81s -> 5875.72s]  What was that?
[5875.72s -> 5876.56s]  Lighter?
[5876.56s -> 5877.80s]  I think Jerma has a lighter.
[5877.80s -> 5878.80s]  I have it.
[5878.80s -> 5879.76s]  What do you need?
[5879.76s -> 5881.41s]  Okay.
[5882.41s -> 5883.73s]  A little something fun will happen.
[5883.73s -> 5884.57s]  Okay.
[5884.57s -> 5885.85s]  Oh, that'd be cool.
[5885.85s -> 5886.97s]  Let's see.
[5886.97s -> 5889.25s]  10 DB, 11 DB.
[5889.25s -> 5890.65s]  I don't, ow, my fucking thumb.
[5890.65s -> 5892.09s]  How do I light this?
[5892.09s -> 5894.56s]  Ow, ow.
[5894.56s -> 5897.64s]  Uh, maybe if it's, I'm in VR, it might be easier.
[5897.64s -> 5898.48s]  Here.
[5901.76s -> 5905.28s]  Oh yeah, you can light it.
[5905.28s -> 5909.58s]  I'm ready with the smoke stick.
[5909.58s -> 5911.10s]  All right, and.
[5911.10s -> 5912.78s]  Smoke stick, smoke stick. Holy shit.
[5912.78s -> 5913.62s]  I don't have to fucking light her.
[5913.62s -> 5916.39s]  Oh my god, oh my god.
[5916.39s -> 5917.23s]  Maddie.
[5917.23s -> 5918.07s]  Ah, run.
[5919.51s -> 5920.99s]  Oh my god, no, no.
[5920.99s -> 5921.91s]  I closed the door.
[5923.31s -> 5924.15s]  What?
[5924.15s -> 5924.99s]  Oh shit, he died.
[5924.99s -> 5925.83s]  Where's the lighter?
[5925.83s -> 5927.35s]  I can't light the smoke stick anymore.
[5927.35s -> 5928.31s]  I have the lighter, I'm sorry.
[5928.31s -> 5929.15s]  Smoke stick me.
[5929.15s -> 5929.99s]  Uh, here.
[5929.99s -> 5930.83s]  Smoke stick me.
[5930.83s -> 5931.83s]  Oh shit, where'd it go?
[5934.72s -> 5936.00s]  I saw it.
[5936.00s -> 5937.60s]  It was big.
[5937.60s -> 5938.44s]  Yeah.
[5938.44s -> 5939.76s]  Where's the lighter?
[5939.76s -> 5942.68s]  It looked like a naked Slenderman.
[5942.68s -> 5944.24s]  What does that mean?
[5944.24s -> 5946.20s]  Um, it could mean nothing.
[5946.20s -> 5947.48s]  The lighter just disappeared.
[5947.48s -> 5948.32s]  That's bad.
[5948.32s -> 5950.64s]  We need to go back to the truck, right now.
[5952.33s -> 5953.17s]  Run.
[5959.20s -> 5961.15s]  I don't know if it.
[5961.15s -> 5961.99s]  What's wrong, you okay?
[5961.99s -> 5962.83s]  It's getting, I've got a three.
[5962.83s -> 5963.67s]  I've got a three.
[5963.67s -> 5964.51s]  Oh, you got locked in there.
[5964.51s -> 5965.47s]  You're in trouble, you're in trouble.
[5965.47s -> 5966.31s]  I'm gonna.
[5966.31s -> 5967.15s]  Yeah, okay, it got to a four.
[5967.15s -> 5968.23s]  It got to a four.
[5968.23s -> 5970.79s]  You good?
[5970.79s -> 5972.56s]  He's dead, he's dead.
[5972.56s -> 5973.80s]  Okay, well, that's your problem.
[5973.80s -> 5974.76s]  Let's just close that door.
[5974.76s -> 5976.12s]  Okay, well, now let's.
[5976.12s -> 5977.88s]  All right, so what evidence do we have, Jerma?
[5977.88s -> 5978.72s]  The evidence that we have,
[5978.72s -> 5980.64s]  it was a thing on the ground
[5980.64s -> 5983.04s]  that we lit the candles to summon it.
[5983.04s -> 5984.40s]  So it's a summitable monster.
[5984.44s -> 5985.56s]  That's one piece of evidence.
[5985.56s -> 5988.68s]  Second piece of evidence, I would say, strangulation.
[5988.68s -> 5990.56s]  There's been two strangulations.
[5990.56s -> 5996.14s]  Third piece of evidence, I would say, is the skin.
[5996.14s -> 5998.34s]  They've got skin, and they like,
[5998.34s -> 6000.42s]  I don't know, something about it.
[6000.42s -> 6003.70s]  They looked like they're, they looked like naked.
[6003.70s -> 6005.14s]  Yeah, they were naked.
[6005.14s -> 6009.35s]  So I saw EMF level, it only got to four.
[6009.35s -> 6010.35s]  It never got to five.
[6010.35s -> 6011.75s]  So that's not evidence.
[6011.75s -> 6014.71s]  Fingerprints, well, I saw it had fingers,
[6014.71s -> 6019.31s]  so we can assume it might have fingerprints.
[6019.31s -> 6020.15s]  Okay.
[6021.67s -> 6025.19s]  Ghost writing, didn't stop to find out
[6025.19s -> 6026.63s]  if it could, if it was, you know.
[6026.63s -> 6027.55s]  We didn't know.
[6027.55s -> 6029.03s]  We could go run in there and look.
[6029.03s -> 6030.23s]  You say EMF level five?
[6031.66s -> 6033.82s]  No, no, it only got to four.
[6035.10s -> 6036.90s]  Freezing temperatures, I didn't have a thing.
[6036.90s -> 6038.66s]  Spirit box.
[6038.66s -> 6039.50s]  I don't know.
[6039.50s -> 6042.26s]  I didn't, I had one, but I didn't use it.
[6043.14s -> 6047.20s]  Uh, ah, shit.
[6047.20s -> 6048.76s]  What does DOTS projector?
[6052.21s -> 6056.41s]  Is that like capturing like spirit orbs or something?
[6056.41s -> 6058.20s]  Or is that separate? Probably.
[6058.20s -> 6060.08s]  No, spirit, ghost orbs are separate.
[6062.31s -> 6063.79s]  How do we look for fingerprints?
[6063.79s -> 6065.36s]  What do we do?
[6065.36s -> 6069.20s]  I think we have to put down like a powder or something.
[6069.20s -> 6070.60s]  Oh, we need salt, right?
[6070.60s -> 6073.50s]  We need to have it walk through salt.
[6073.50s -> 6075.30s]  Should we try to do that?
[6075.30s -> 6076.14s]  We could try.
[6076.14s -> 6076.98s]  Okay, so how about this?
[6077.94s -> 6081.58s]  Yeah, I'm going to go stand out in the middle of the house
[6081.58s -> 6083.10s]  and just pretend like, oh, I don't know.
[6083.10s -> 6084.14s]  Well, where's my friends?
[6084.14s -> 6085.66s]  And then like when it, when it's going to show up,
[6085.66s -> 6091.29s]  just put the salt down.
[6091.29s -> 6092.37s]  No, I was going to just be,
[6092.37s -> 6096.02s]  I was just going to bait the ghost out.
[6096.02s -> 6096.86s]  It's right here.
[6096.86s -> 6097.70s]  It's right here.
[6097.70s -> 6098.54s]  It's here. It's here.
[6098.54s -> 6099.38s]  It's here.
[6099.38s -> 6100.22s]  I think it's going to kill you.
[6100.22s -> 6101.22s]  Yeah, it is.
[6101.22s -> 6102.06s]  Yeah, I'm dead.
[6102.06s -> 6102.90s]  Without a doubt.
[6102.90s -> 6105.06s]  It's literally, but I'm right in front of the door.
[6105.06s -> 6107.02s]  Put the salt down right now.
[6107.02s -> 6107.86s]  Ow.
[6107.86s -> 6116.67s]  Dude, it's like he had a can of bug spray.
[6119.39s -> 6123.64s]  He looks, he had a can of bug spray, like a can of raid.
[6123.64s -> 6124.68s]  Where is it?
[6124.68s -> 6129.46s]  Shh.
[6129.46s -> 6141.02s]  That was loud.
[6141.02s -> 6142.14s]  Hey, what's up?
[6142.14s -> 6143.42s]  That's a cat.
[6143.42s -> 6145.46s]  Your ghost was on the camera for some reason.
[6145.46s -> 6146.30s]  That was funny.
[6146.30s -> 6148.22s]  Hey, will I be on the camera?
[6148.22s -> 6149.30s]  Yeah, I think you will.
[6149.30s -> 6150.14s]  Okay.
[6150.14s -> 6150.98s]  Woo.
[6150.98s -> 6152.14s]  There he is.
[6152.14s -> 6152.98s]  Oh wow.
[6152.98s -> 6153.82s]  It's Vinny's ghost.
[6153.82s -> 6155.06s]  Sounds like Dodd.
[6155.06s -> 6155.90s]  Here, hang on a sec.
[6156.46s -> 6157.30s]  Quick floss.
[6158.66s -> 6160.70s]  That's got the letters of dog in there.
[6164.11s -> 6164.95s]  Yeah.
[6164.95s -> 6165.79s]  I'm just going to.
[6165.79s -> 6167.11s]  I have no idea what that,
[6167.11s -> 6168.95s]  and I don't know how to shake the salt either.
[6168.95s -> 6170.83s]  I don't know how to make the salt.
[6170.83s -> 6175.80s]  I think you just put it on the floor and then.
[6175.80s -> 6177.12s]  That was so funny, dude.
[6178.76s -> 6180.56s]  That was literally, you literally were crawling in.
[6180.56s -> 6182.20s]  Like you had a can of bug spray in your hand.
[6182.20s -> 6183.28s]  It was so funny.
[6193.15s -> 6194.43s]  I was close though.
[6194.43s -> 6196.64s]  We got money.
[6196.64s -> 6197.48s]  I got $10.
[6197.48s -> 6198.32s]  We got 10 bucks.
[6198.32s -> 6199.16s]  That's all right.
[6200.00s -> 6201.36s]  That's the most money I've got all night.
[6201.36s -> 6202.36s]  Oh, 33.
[6203.80s -> 6204.64s]  I got it.
[6204.64s -> 6206.56s]  It's money.
[6206.56s -> 6209.52s]  You got five bucks.
[6209.52s -> 6211.35s]  Oh my goodness.
[6211.35s -> 6214.23s]  Well, I mean, somebody in your chat Vinny mentioned
[6214.23s -> 6215.71s]  what were they expecting when they lit it.
[6215.71s -> 6218.51s]  I was like, I don't know, something would happen.
[6218.51s -> 6220.39s]  Some action maybe.
[6220.39s -> 6222.71s]  I didn't think we were going to summon a demon
[6222.71s -> 6223.87s]  like immediately.
[6223.87s -> 6226.63s]  I thought maybe it would be subtle.
[6226.63s -> 6227.87s]  I didn't think we were going to summon
[6227.87s -> 6231.19s]  like the fucking skinwalker right in front of us.
[6231.19s -> 6235.60s]  That was, it was not prepared.
[6235.60s -> 6236.96s]  Wait, there's bowling?
[6236.96s -> 6237.80s]  Wait, what?
[6239.22s -> 6241.39s]  Wait, does the bowling work?
[6241.39s -> 6246.00s]  Oh, does this work?
[6246.00s -> 6246.84s]  It does.
[6246.84s -> 6248.28s]  We can, wait, this Jenga?
[6249.40s -> 6250.24s]  Oh shit.
[6250.24s -> 6251.08s]  Oh, you've lost.
[6251.08s -> 6253.56s]  Hold on, man.
[6253.56s -> 6254.88s]  Jenga.
[6254.88s -> 6256.96s]  Yeah, that was the move.
[6256.96s -> 6258.32s]  You don't want to play Jenga,
[6258.32s -> 6261.04s]  but you're going to just like humor us and.
[6261.04s -> 6262.32s]  Let's put it back together.
[6263.44s -> 6265.28s]  And you're going to be like, oh shit, I lost.
[6265.28s -> 6266.20s]  This will be the rest of the stream.
[6266.20s -> 6273.81s]  Putting back, putting back the tower here.
[6273.81s -> 6274.65s]  Oh, I see.
[6274.65s -> 6276.53s]  Let me add some color to the town.
[6276.53s -> 6277.37s]  Oh my God.
[6277.37s -> 6281.04s]  What?
[6281.04s -> 6285.68s]  Oh, it's making like source engine sounds.
[6285.68s -> 6289.48s]  Check this out.
[6289.48s -> 6290.32s]  Oh my God.
[6290.32s -> 6293.58s]  That does sound like Gary's mod.
[6293.58s -> 6295.02s]  Does this look weird?
[6295.02s -> 6296.18s]  Oh, I got it.
[6299.20s -> 6300.72s]  That you guys, you guys want to do another one
[6300.72s -> 6302.68s]  or you guys think it's not enough time?
[6302.68s -> 6304.48s]  Do one more.
[6304.48s -> 6307.35s]  We got to win.
[6307.35s -> 6308.27s]  You can do this.
[6308.47s -> 6311.86s]  It's still fun though.
[6311.86s -> 6317.47s]  Do you guys see what's happening to the basketball?
[6317.47s -> 6318.71s]  It's.
[6318.71s -> 6322.03s]  I see it like hovering, jittering.
[6329.73s -> 6332.24s]  Oh, a ball.
[6332.24s -> 6333.08s]  Does this work?
[6334.12s -> 6335.32s]  It's just a table.
[6338.42s -> 6340.50s]  Hey, you dropped this.
[6340.50s -> 6341.34s]  No.
[6341.34s -> 6343.22s]  I'm just enamored with the source engine sounds
[6343.22s -> 6344.06s]  over here on the table.
[6344.06s -> 6344.98s]  Okay.
[6344.98s -> 6346.10s]  Yeah, we can do one more.
[6346.10s -> 6351.12s]  Maybe we'll do like, oh geez.
[6351.20s -> 6353.84s]  Hey, is there anything easier than that?
[6353.84s -> 6355.96s]  Is there, is there another easy short one
[6355.96s -> 6357.52s]  that's like not a house?
[6360.32s -> 6362.04s]  Like what's the one on the right there?
[6362.04s -> 6364.64s]  This one, the, all the way on the top right.
[6364.64s -> 6365.60s]  Willow street?
[6366.97s -> 6367.97s]  Is that a house?
[6367.97s -> 6369.37s]  It could be small.
[6369.37s -> 6371.57s]  What is this a times 18 times two things?
[6371.57s -> 6372.41s]  Is this how many floors there are?
[6372.41s -> 6373.25s]  How many rooms?
[6373.25s -> 6374.21s]  Oh, it's how many, yeah.
[6374.21s -> 6376.05s]  How many rooms are in each house?
[6376.05s -> 6379.13s]  So we did just pick a small one, Willow street.
[6379.13s -> 6382.08s]  All right, let's do Willow street then.
[6382.72s -> 6383.56s]  All right, one more.
[6383.56s -> 6385.40s]  This would be definitely,
[6386.52s -> 6389.00s]  that'll get that chat member to sub.
[6389.00s -> 6392.00s]  Oh yeah.
[6392.00s -> 6393.92s]  Let me add more equipment here.
[6393.92s -> 6396.56s]  How much money do you have in this game, Liam?
[6396.56s -> 6397.80s]  $1,600.
[6397.80s -> 6398.64s]  What?
[6398.64s -> 6399.48s]  Okay, wow.
[6400.72s -> 6402.84s]  You like this game, don't you?
[6402.84s -> 6405.12s]  A little bit.
[6405.12s -> 6406.88s]  I have $42.
[6406.88s -> 6409.14s]  It's 17.
[6409.14s -> 6410.54s]  Okay, I understand how the UI works.
[6410.54s -> 6412.30s]  I'm gonna add all this crap.
[6412.30s -> 6416.91s]  We need a candle crucifix.
[6416.91s -> 6420.50s]  What's happening?
[6420.50s -> 6428.17s]  Hey!
[6428.17s -> 6429.01s]  Why are you in the ground?
[6429.01s -> 6430.48s]  Oh, there you go.
[6430.48s -> 6437.36s]  I'm just sitting.
[6437.36s -> 6440.16s]  Sorry, just finishing up adding all the equipment here.
[6440.16s -> 6441.68s]  I hope I don't die because I'll lose all this,
[6441.68s -> 6444.64s]  but what can you do?
[6444.64s -> 6447.97s]  Am I a puddle?
[6447.97s -> 6449.69s]  No, you're like a,
[6449.69s -> 6450.53s]  It's very impressive what you're doing.
[6450.53s -> 6452.93s]  Guy running onto his feet while shitting, like you're.
[6452.93s -> 6460.66s]  You know, it almost looks like you got
[6460.66s -> 6462.66s]  like a really baggy pair of pants
[6462.66s -> 6466.78s]  and push your arms and legs through both leg holes
[6466.78s -> 6468.74s]  and put it all the way up and are walking around
[6468.74s -> 6472.96s]  kind of with your arms and legs in each pant leg.
[6472.96s -> 6473.80s]  I just spent $600.
[6473.80s -> 6476.16s]  It's a very specific mental image.
[6476.16s -> 6477.60s]  Goblin mode, someone wrote.
[6479.92s -> 6482.20s]  Okay, wow, $600, you say?
[6482.20s -> 6484.00s]  Yeah, I added a bunch of equipment.
[6485.00s -> 6487.04s]  Well, we're definitely gonna win this one.
[6487.04s -> 6488.80s]  There's no way we're not.
[6488.80s -> 6490.44s]  Investing in success.
[6490.44s -> 6491.28s]  All right, let's do it.
[6491.28s -> 6497.02s]  Here we go, everybody.
[6497.02s -> 6501.29s]  All right.
[6501.29s -> 6503.86s]  Another campsite map.
[6503.86s -> 6505.10s]  Ooh.
[6505.10s -> 6507.14s]  Let's get that sub, guys.
[6507.14s -> 6508.26s]  What was the campsite?
[6508.26s -> 6514.04s]  We need to get at least that one sub.
[6514.04s -> 6517.20s]  Yo, can we go back and do the campsite instead?
[6517.20s -> 6519.48s]  Because people are saying that one's cool.
[6519.48s -> 6521.32s]  I remember it, kind of.
[6521.32s -> 6522.92s]  Oh, you wanna do that instead?
[6522.92s -> 6524.72s]  Yeah, is it possible to abandon this
[6524.72s -> 6525.56s]  and not lose the equipment?
[6525.56s -> 6529.08s]  Yeah, we just guess immediately and then leave, right?
[6529.08s -> 6530.36s]  Yeah.
[6530.36s -> 6532.40s]  We won't lose any equipment,
[6532.40s -> 6534.00s]  but I think we'll lose money.
[6534.00s -> 6535.84s]  No, only if we die, so yeah.
[6535.84s -> 6537.76s]  Yeah, that's fine, we'll just guess.
[6537.76s -> 6540.00s]  The campsite sounds great.
[6540.84s -> 6543.28s]  I think Jermal would like it, according to my chat.
[6543.28s -> 6544.12s]  Oh yeah, let's do it.
[6544.12s -> 6545.72s]  I'm gonna guess, um,
[6549.61s -> 6555.09s]  Let's go for it.
[6555.09s -> 6556.41s]  What's that called, chat?
[6560.88s -> 6562.27s]  Okay.
[6562.27s -> 6563.35s]  Moroi, okay.
[6564.43s -> 6565.95s]  Woodwind, it's called.
[6565.95s -> 6567.19s]  Woodwind.
[6567.19s -> 6569.11s]  Camp Woodwind, I see it, okay.
[6569.11s -> 6571.67s]  Perfect, okay, it's a small campsite map.
[6571.67s -> 6574.11s]  The other campsite I played years ago was too big,
[6574.11s -> 6576.97s]  so that's perfect, okay.
[6576.97s -> 6578.29s]  All right, sorry, everyone.
[6578.29s -> 6579.77s]  This should be fun.
[6579.77s -> 6583.49s]  I'm gonna add some more equipment.
[6583.49s -> 6585.61s]  Yeah, we're fine, we got everything.
[6585.61s -> 6586.45s]  Okay.
[6587.76s -> 6592.50s]  Do you think I could quickly squeeze a game of Jenga in, or?
[6592.50s -> 6595.62s]  We can play Jenga and then watch a terrible movie afterwards.
[6595.62s -> 6597.70s]  Really cool to see Shifter Xeris become a streamer,
[6597.70s -> 6599.50s]  I loved you, thanks.
[6604.16s -> 6608.42s]  Swarhas, Jerm, are you gonna write it yet?
[6608.42s -> 6610.06s]  Oh wait, you did, sorry.
[6610.06s -> 6618.51s]  I just did when you were saying it, so you were right.
[6618.51s -> 6622.52s]  Is this just a campsite, huh?
[6622.52s -> 6624.08s]  Glory, shell, and gold.
[6624.08s -> 6627.00s]  Do you remember Salute Your Shorts on Nickelodeon?
[6628.12s -> 6630.28s]  This'll be like that, like it'll be like camping
[6630.28s -> 6632.44s]  and Zeke the Plumber's gonna come after us.
[6635.60s -> 6637.00s]  Okay, I got an EMF.
[6639.58s -> 6640.42s]  What is this thing?
[6640.42s -> 6641.46s]  Okay, or I could throw it.
[6641.46s -> 6644.22s]  What's this like, this knee pad, what is this?
[6644.22s -> 6646.02s]  And just the crucifix, okay.
[6646.02s -> 6648.38s]  So we don't need to do anything specific
[6648.38s -> 6651.94s]  other than crucifix and EMF and not die, so.
[6651.94s -> 6653.34s]  This is for dots projector.
[6653.34s -> 6654.18s]  Oh, okay.
[6654.18s -> 6655.02s]  I can live, I can live.
[6655.02s -> 6655.86s]  Can I take it?
[6657.10s -> 6659.00s]  I'm gonna take this thing.
[6659.00s -> 6663.12s]  Somebody else take the spirit box this time?
[6663.12s -> 6665.84s]  I'll take the spirit box, where is it?
[6665.84s -> 6666.68s]  Right here, next to the book.
[6666.68s -> 6668.08s]  Is that the orange one, okay.
[6669.58s -> 6671.06s]  All right, cool.
[6671.06s -> 6673.70s]  And then I'll take a glow stick.
[6673.70s -> 6675.02s]  Temperature thing here.
[6677.98s -> 6679.26s]  Why is there a camera already pointed
[6679.26s -> 6680.50s]  at the back of the truck?
[6683.53s -> 6684.61s]  That's creepy.
[6684.61s -> 6685.45s]  Yeah, that's a little weird.
[6685.45s -> 6687.94s]  That's weird.
[6688.82s -> 6690.82s]  We don't need a salt or a stick or anything?
[6692.60s -> 6694.28s]  No, we don't.
[6694.28s -> 6695.16s]  All right.
[6695.16s -> 6697.24s]  Just the crucifix and EMF for sure,
[6697.24s -> 6699.64s]  and then the rest we can discern as we go.
[6699.64s -> 6701.39s]  Okay.
[6701.39s -> 6703.27s]  We should be okay this time, maybe.
[6705.23s -> 6706.55s]  I'm just gonna stop saying that.
[6706.55s -> 6708.27s]  Camp Woodwind.
[6714.03s -> 6715.91s]  Oh my God, I'm sorry.
[6715.91s -> 6716.75s]  I don't know, I just, like,
[6716.75s -> 6717.99s]  you guys walked right in front of me.
[6717.99s -> 6719.51s]  I just thought you, it was like immediately,
[6719.51s -> 6720.67s]  I was getting attacked.
[6724.94s -> 6726.18s]  All right, I'll be okay.
[6729.45s -> 6730.57s]  For some reason, I just forgot
[6730.57s -> 6732.49s]  that you were right there somehow.
[6732.49s -> 6736.45s]  I knew you were there, but I don't know.
[6736.45s -> 6740.21s]  What am I looking for on the EMF?
[6740.21s -> 6743.93s]  You are looking for level five or anything.
[6743.93s -> 6744.85s]  Level five as well.
[6744.85s -> 6745.73s]  Oh, the spirit box.
[6745.73s -> 6748.53s]  Oh, you're just listening for sound.
[6748.53s -> 6750.49s]  Like if it's the ghost talks.
[6750.49s -> 6751.89s]  Who's got the EMF then?
[6751.89s -> 6753.05s]  I have the dots thing.
[6754.59s -> 6755.63s]  Where should I put the dots thing?
[6755.63s -> 6756.47s]  Does it matter?
[6757.67s -> 6758.51s]  Dots thing?
[6758.51s -> 6759.71s]  The dots projector?
[6761.16s -> 6762.00s]  Oh, I don't know.
[6762.00s -> 6762.84s]  Does that mean?
[6763.48s -> 6764.80s]  What does this do?
[6764.80s -> 6765.64s]  Wasn't in the hole.
[6765.64s -> 6766.48s]  I have no idea.
[6766.48s -> 6768.40s]  There's a Ouija board.
[6768.40s -> 6770.00s]  We can use that to talk to the ghost.
[6770.00s -> 6771.24s]  Oh.
[6771.24s -> 6772.64s]  All right, let's do it.
[6772.64s -> 6774.36s]  Okay, that's what that does.
[6774.36s -> 6775.96s]  Can I turn it off?
[6775.96s -> 6776.80s]  Oh.
[6776.80s -> 6777.96s]  What is that noise?
[6777.96s -> 6778.80s]  Wait, was that?
[6778.80s -> 6779.62s]  It's level three.
[6779.62s -> 6780.46s]  I just got level three.
[6780.46s -> 6781.30s]  Level three?
[6781.30s -> 6782.12s]  By Jerma.
[6782.12s -> 6782.96s]  Ghosts, speak to us.
[6782.96s -> 6783.96s]  Yo, that thing is moving on its own.
[6783.96s -> 6784.80s]  That bottle is moving on its own.
[6784.80s -> 6786.04s]  Yeah, that bottle is moving.
[6786.04s -> 6787.48s]  Which one?
[6787.48s -> 6789.00s]  Ghosts.
[6789.00s -> 6791.48s]  It's just level three though, not level five.
[6791.52s -> 6794.72s]  So we can roll that out, perhaps.
[6794.72s -> 6795.84s]  Okay.
[6795.84s -> 6797.24s]  No temperature change.
[6797.24s -> 6798.32s]  It's still like 13.
[6798.32s -> 6799.16s]  Not really.
[6799.16s -> 6804.58s]  It's going between like...
[6804.58s -> 6805.42s]  Okay.
[6805.42s -> 6806.84s]  I'm gonna set up a video camera.
[6806.84s -> 6807.68s]  I'm gonna go back to the truck.
[6807.68s -> 6809.06s]  I'll be right back.
[6809.06s -> 6812.16s]  All right, good call.
[6812.16s -> 6816.20s]  Ghosts, what is your name?
[6816.20s -> 6819.71s]  Oh my God, they got hand-pined beans.
[6819.71s -> 6821.43s]  So what are we looking for with this?
[6821.43s -> 6823.23s]  Kiwi beans?
[6823.23s -> 6824.59s]  Did you die in the toilet?
[6825.19s -> 6828.36s]  Uh, was this like an Xbox Kinect?
[6828.36s -> 6830.08s]  What does it do?
[6831.36s -> 6832.20s]  I don't know.
[6832.20s -> 6833.88s]  It projects dots.
[6835.15s -> 6836.07s]  Okay.
[6836.07s -> 6837.83s]  Does that help us see ghosts or?
[6842.92s -> 6843.76s]  What's that?
[6843.76s -> 6845.04s]  I can't be good for your eyes.
[6845.04s -> 6846.95s]  What's that?
[6846.95s -> 6847.79s]  What's that?
[6847.79s -> 6848.91s]  Is somebody out?
[6848.91s -> 6851.55s]  Are we all together or is somebody walking around
[6851.55s -> 6852.39s]  back there?
[6852.39s -> 6854.22s]  Are we all together?
[6854.22s -> 6855.06s]  I think we all are.
[6855.06s -> 6856.90s]  Wait, did you guys turn the camera on?
[6856.90s -> 6857.74s]  Oh, are we all on the campfire?
[6857.74s -> 6858.58s]  Oh, the shower just turned on.
[6858.78s -> 6860.66s]  The shower just turned on on its own.
[6860.66s -> 6861.74s]  Did you guys see that?
[6861.74s -> 6863.34s]  What do you mean it turned on on its own?
[6863.34s -> 6864.94s]  There's a shower?
[6864.94s -> 6867.34s]  Ghost, are you taking a shower?
[6867.34s -> 6869.14s]  Ghost, what are you doing in there?
[6869.14s -> 6870.10s]  Talk to us.
[6870.10s -> 6870.94s]  Oh, there is a shower.
[6870.94s -> 6873.22s]  Wait, you get the dots thing.
[6873.22s -> 6876.45s]  No.
[6876.45s -> 6881.26s]  I'm not weird, but I'm gonna set up a camera in the shower.
[6881.26s -> 6886.02s]  Good thing you clarified that early.
[6886.02s -> 6889.45s]  Okay.
[6889.45s -> 6891.01s]  Ghost, why don't you speak to me now
[6891.01s -> 6892.57s]  and tell me why you turned on the shower?
[6892.57s -> 6896.09s]  Can you shower in the afterlife?
[6896.13s -> 6897.65s]  Oh, okay.
[6897.65s -> 6898.49s]  There we go.
[6898.49s -> 6903.79s]  Why is it not on when I put it down?
[6903.79s -> 6909.60s]  You wanna turn it so it's facing the hot ghost action?
[6910.12s -> 6912.75s]  Yeah.
[6912.75s -> 6915.77s]  Ghost, what was that?
[6915.77s -> 6918.72s]  What's that?
[6918.72s -> 6920.76s]  I hear crunching.
[6920.76s -> 6925.54s]  That could be us just walking, perhaps?
[6925.54s -> 6928.02s]  Maybe the ghost is eating Cheerios, I don't know.
[6928.02s -> 6929.46s]  What's that then?
[6929.46s -> 6936.88s]  Oh, okay.
[6936.88s -> 6946.32s]  You said maybe.
[6946.32s -> 6950.48s]  That's right, it's weird that your name is Liam, you know?
[6950.48s -> 6951.52s]  Yeah, that's weird.
[6952.44s -> 6955.81s]  Can we turn the, can we light the fire?
[6955.81s -> 6958.21s]  We start the campfire or no?
[6958.21s -> 6960.41s]  Because when we did our interview,
[6960.41s -> 6962.01s]  like we talked about Liam Gallagher
[6962.01s -> 6964.47s]  for like 10 minutes for no reason.
[6964.47s -> 6968.08s]  Well, no, because your name is Liam, like, you know?
[6968.08s -> 6970.98s]  Oh yeah, right, yeah, I remember that, yeah.
[6970.98s -> 6972.83s]  So I am Liam Gallagher.
[6972.83s -> 6975.95s]  But you're also gonna be in The Witcher, so.
[6975.95s -> 6977.19s]  Yeah, that's right, yeah, I am.
[6977.19s -> 6979.47s]  I just got the call from Netflix.
[6979.47s -> 6981.43s]  Netflix is telling you they wanna chill.
[6982.43s -> 6986.80s]  It's not a time to be messing around and making jokes.
[6986.80s -> 6988.28s]  There's a ghost here.
[6995.28s -> 6996.12s]  Ghosts.
[6996.12s -> 6998.32s]  Wait, it's minus seven, it's minus seven, right?
[6998.32s -> 6999.64s]  It's minus 11. Oh, perfect, okay.
[6999.64s -> 7001.32s]  I'm gonna write it down, freezing temperatures.
[7001.32s -> 7002.76s]  Freezing temperatures.
[7002.76s -> 7003.88s]  Freezing temperatures for sure.
[7003.88s -> 7005.24s]  Ghosts, freezing temperatures.
[7005.24s -> 7006.08s]  Speak to us.
[7008.22s -> 7011.30s]  Does anybody have a UV light or the journal?
[7011.30s -> 7013.07s]  I got one over here.
[7013.07s -> 7013.99s]  Journal?
[7013.99s -> 7014.83s]  A UV light.
[7014.83s -> 7016.07s]  I had a UV light, I put it down.
[7016.07s -> 7018.51s]  If you have a journal, put it in the shower.
[7019.39s -> 7021.59s]  That's the first time anyone has said that sentence.
[7021.59s -> 7024.19s]  What do you wanna do with the UV light?
[7024.19s -> 7026.64s]  Just look for fingerprints.
[7026.64s -> 7027.72s]  Oh. I don't see any though.
[7027.72s -> 7028.56s]  I just threw it into the.
[7028.56s -> 7029.80s]  Yeah, like, don't do that.
[7031.76s -> 7034.04s]  That's a glow stick, actually.
[7034.04s -> 7034.88s]  Will it show?
[7036.24s -> 7038.40s]  Yeah, on the walls, if you look around.
[7038.40s -> 7039.40s]  I'm pretty sure, I don't know
[7039.40s -> 7040.96s]  if the glow stick reveals fingerprints.
[7040.96s -> 7042.64s]  I'm pretty sure the UV light does that.
[7042.64s -> 7043.48s]  No.
[7046.16s -> 7048.00s]  Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, colds.
[7048.00s -> 7049.96s]  I had cold breath right over there.
[7049.96s -> 7050.80s]  Cold breath.
[7051.68s -> 7052.52s]  Right there?
[7052.52s -> 7053.36s]  Okay, that's where the ghost is.
[7053.36s -> 7057.64s]  It's not the shower.
[7057.64s -> 7059.56s]  Ghost is here somewhere.
[7059.56s -> 7060.40s]  What's that?
[7064.36s -> 7065.52s]  I dropped the temperature gun
[7065.52s -> 7068.88s]  because I figured we don't really need it.
[7068.88s -> 7070.80s]  Yeah, yeah, that's a good idea.
[7070.80s -> 7071.64s]  I'll be right back.
[7071.64s -> 7073.28s]  I'm gonna go get some more evidence.
[7073.28s -> 7074.64s]  Ghost, can you speak?
[7074.64s -> 7077.72s]  I'm trying to communicate with you.
[7077.72s -> 7078.56s]  Please, tell me.
[7078.56s -> 7082.00s]  I'm just trying to get the black light in the shower.
[7082.00s -> 7083.84s]  Ghost, who do you think I am?
[7083.84s -> 7087.52s]  We can rule out the shower.
[7087.52s -> 7088.36s]  I got a book.
[7088.36s -> 7091.40s]  Do you want me to throw it out of the book anywhere?
[7091.64s -> 7092.48s]  I got the dots.
[7093.76s -> 7095.76s]  Move the dots.
[7095.76s -> 7098.43s]  All right, I'm gonna put the dots over here.
[7098.43s -> 7101.44s]  There should be a camera on the truck pod.
[7101.44s -> 7109.76s]  Ghost, how do you feel about the Brighter Chief?
[7109.76s -> 7111.68s]  Sorry, I was in my own world for a second.
[7111.68s -> 7113.36s]  What was your question?
[7114.40s -> 7116.23s]  How do you open the book?
[7116.23s -> 7119.67s]  Oh, you have to press F on a surface.
[7119.67s -> 7136.90s]  First I can tell, no ghost.
[7136.90s -> 7139.88s]  So should I get rid of the DOS projector?
[7139.88s -> 7141.68s]  No, I think we can leave it there.
[7141.68s -> 7144.16s]  I don't think I'll scare the ghost off.
[7144.20s -> 7152.00s]  You can go back to the truck and see if we see anything.
[7152.00s -> 7155.48s]  Oh, hey, Dapper Chief.
[7155.48s -> 7159.36s]  So it's either a demon, a Moroi, or the Mimic.
[7160.72s -> 7161.84s]  You know what, Vinny, I do too.
[7161.84s -> 7162.80s]  It's just gross.
[7164.59s -> 7168.19s]  Wait, wait, so you said it could be four things?
[7170.12s -> 7170.96s]  What do we need?
[7170.96s -> 7172.52s]  So it's four things?
[7172.52s -> 7175.52s]  It's either the demon, the Moroi, or the Mimic.
[7176.68s -> 7178.32s]  Why don't we all just pick a different one
[7178.32s -> 7181.64s]  and then we'll at least get a partial win.
[7181.64s -> 7182.96s]  Listen, I need that sub.
[7184.84s -> 7185.68s]  That's true.
[7185.68s -> 7189.60s]  So what, okay, so what do those four ghosts do
[7189.60s -> 7193.22s]  that we should be looking for?
[7193.22s -> 7194.46s]  They make some kind of sound?
[7194.46s -> 7197.18s]  Do they make some kind of noise?
[7197.18s -> 7201.64s]  Do they leave fingerprints or?
[7201.64s -> 7202.72s]  Throw a football.
[7205.43s -> 7208.31s]  So what did you say it could be?
[7208.31s -> 7211.23s]  It's either a demon, Moroi, or the Mimic.
[7212.18s -> 7214.26s]  All right, so we're looking for ghost writing.
[7214.26s -> 7217.34s]  Did we get any spirit box readings at all?
[7217.34s -> 7221.36s]  Like did it say anything to you, Vinny?
[7221.36s -> 7223.68s]  No, it doesn't want to talk to me.
[7223.68s -> 7226.80s]  Okay, did we have a UV light?
[7226.80s -> 7228.68s]  Yeah, we need to find fingerprints.
[7229.94s -> 7232.82s]  We can rule out two of these if we rule out fingerprints.
[7232.82s -> 7234.02s]  Wait, did you turn on the generator?
[7234.02s -> 7235.54s]  The generator just turned on.
[7235.54s -> 7237.52s]  That was Vinny, I think.
[7237.52s -> 7240.32s]  Okay, Vinny, turn it off.
[7240.32s -> 7242.56s]  Yeah, that was not.
[7242.56s -> 7246.91s]  Who's did?
[7246.91s -> 7247.75s]  What?
[7248.59s -> 7249.87s]  How?
[7249.87s -> 7251.07s]  How did that happen?
[7253.48s -> 7255.56s]  Honestly, like which one of you two did that?
[7255.56s -> 7257.68s]  Because there was no ghost.
[7258.64s -> 7259.84s]  I was further away.
[7262.62s -> 7265.34s]  Oh my God.
[7265.34s -> 7268.64s]  Whoa, Gumby.
[7268.64s -> 7270.40s]  Holy shit.
[7270.40s -> 7276.54s]  Why did you kill our friend Ross and my framerates?
[7276.54s -> 7279.95s]  All right, well that was.
[7279.95s -> 7281.99s]  Okay, the DOS protector's down too, right?
[7281.99s -> 7282.83s]  Nothing?
[7282.83s -> 7283.67s]  It's right here.
[7283.67s -> 7285.67s]  What are we looking for in the DOS protector?
[7286.39s -> 7287.23s]  We need to find fingerprints.
[7287.23s -> 7289.15s]  I put a crucifix and I dropped it, I think.
[7289.15s -> 7290.87s]  Where's the UV light?
[7290.87s -> 7291.71s]  I got a crucifix.
[7291.71s -> 7295.51s]  Oh, I don't think we have a UV light.
[7295.51s -> 7297.31s]  We don't have a UV light.
[7297.31s -> 7298.15s]  I thought we did.
[7298.15s -> 7298.99s]  Ghosts speak to us.
[7298.99s -> 7299.83s]  What is your name?
[7299.83s -> 7300.71s]  Can the glow stick look for fingerprints too
[7300.71s -> 7302.23s]  or am I totally wrong?
[7302.23s -> 7304.35s]  That's what we were trying to figure out.
[7304.35s -> 7307.83s]  Yeah, I figured you could only, I don't know.
[7310.67s -> 7316.04s]  Well, I think we might have to leave the chance.
[7316.12s -> 7320.20s]  Hey, this process, this looks like it.
[7320.20s -> 7321.04s]  Oh, they just.
[7321.04s -> 7321.88s]  Yeah, they.
[7321.88s -> 7322.72s]  Oh, yeah, it's.
[7322.72s -> 7323.56s]  Oh.
[7323.56s -> 7325.28s]  Hello?
[7325.28s -> 7326.52s]  Ghosts die.
[7326.52s -> 7328.89s]  So it looks like we got it.
[7328.89s -> 7330.81s]  Yeah, I just dropped the crucifix
[7330.81s -> 7331.65s]  and it's gone.
[7331.65s -> 7334.00s]  We should go to the truck, truck.
[7334.00s -> 7335.32s]  Before anybody else dies.
[7335.32s -> 7336.16s]  Yeah.
[7336.16s -> 7337.00s]  They're weird noise.
[7337.00s -> 7337.84s]  They closed the gate.
[7337.84s -> 7339.44s]  Oh, the gate's closed.
[7339.44s -> 7340.28s]  Well.
[7340.28s -> 7341.12s]  Just jump it, man.
[7341.12s -> 7344.16s]  Can we not help him?
[7344.16s -> 7345.00s]  It's here, it's here.
[7345.00s -> 7345.84s]  There it is.
[7345.84s -> 7346.88s]  There it is, I think.
[7346.88s -> 7347.72s]  There it is, it's on the ground.
[7348.08s -> 7349.04s]  It's crawling on the ground.
[7349.04s -> 7350.36s]  It's crawling on the ground.
[7350.36s -> 7351.68s]  It's crawling on the ground.
[7351.68s -> 7352.52s]  It's got me.
[7360.26s -> 7365.12s]  Jesus, it's so loud and I turned it down.
[7365.12s -> 7365.96s]  Man.
[7365.96s -> 7367.30s]  What's up?
[7367.30s -> 7370.30s]  It crawls on the ground.
[7370.30s -> 7372.58s]  Yeah, it crawls on the ground like a little goblin
[7372.58s -> 7373.79s]  and then chokes.
[7373.79s -> 7374.91s]  I'm a member of your team escape.
[7374.91s -> 7376.71s]  No one has escaped.
[7376.71s -> 7377.95s]  We're at zero sanity.
[7377.95s -> 7378.79s]  All right.
[7383.38s -> 7384.94s]  People saying, hey, why didn't you do anything?
[7384.94s -> 7387.66s]  The ghost was attacking and you didn't do anything
[7387.66s -> 7388.82s]  and I'm sitting there just trying to,
[7388.82s -> 7391.10s]  I'm just trying to give info, right?
[7391.10s -> 7392.22s]  I know I'm dead.
[7392.22s -> 7394.46s]  So I'm sitting there going like crawling on the ground,
[7394.46s -> 7396.26s]  looks like it's a demon and I'm dead,
[7396.26s -> 7399.73s]  but they have that info.
[7399.73s -> 7403.25s]  My job is to make sure they get that info.
[7403.25s -> 7405.13s]  So we got freezing temperatures, right?
[7405.13s -> 7408.45s]  Is that a, we definitely got freezing temperature?
[7408.45s -> 7410.41s]  We got EMF level five or no?
[7410.41s -> 7411.88s]  No.
[7411.88s -> 7414.56s]  Basically, I ruled out ghost orbs and EMF level five
[7414.56s -> 7415.40s]  because I didn't see.
[7415.40s -> 7416.32s]  I think it's a demon.
[7416.32s -> 7418.44s]  Well, first of all, it wouldn't go beyond three
[7418.48s -> 7422.08s]  and the ghost orbs just aren't showing up on the monitor.
[7422.08s -> 7423.72s]  We just didn't do anything, for instance.
[7423.72s -> 7425.24s]  I don't know how to look for stuff
[7425.24s -> 7426.64s]  in the dots projector though.
[7426.64s -> 7428.08s]  Yeah, I didn't see anything.
[7431.50s -> 7435.58s]  Chat, did you see any?
[7435.58s -> 7436.42s]  You're winning, son.
[7436.42s -> 7438.66s]  You gave them the info.
[7438.66s -> 7439.82s]  Yeah.
[7439.82s -> 7442.44s]  If you click twice.
[7442.44s -> 7443.88s]  So no spirit box either.
[7443.88s -> 7446.01s]  Oh, it's the demon.
[7446.01s -> 7447.49s]  Does that look like?
[7447.49s -> 7448.33s]  I'd say demon too.
[7448.33s -> 7449.17s]  Yeah, I just ruled out,
[7449.17s -> 7451.33s]  after ruling out three of the types of evidence,
[7451.37s -> 7453.45s]  it just gave me the demon as one of the possible answers.
[7453.45s -> 7454.37s]  Let me see the demon.
[7454.37s -> 7456.37s]  Demons are aggressive.
[7456.37s -> 7457.45s]  Going to attack without reason.
[7457.45s -> 7458.29s]  This is very aggressive.
[7458.29s -> 7459.21s]  They enjoy the thrill of the hunts.
[7459.21s -> 7461.05s]  They initiate hunts more often.
[7461.05s -> 7462.61s]  Demons fear the crucifix
[7462.61s -> 7464.01s]  and will be less aggressive than you're one.
[7464.01s -> 7465.25s]  So that makes sense.
[7465.25s -> 7467.45s]  Yeah, it did blow it up.
[7467.45s -> 7468.61s]  It would have been fingerprints,
[7468.61s -> 7470.41s]  ghost writing, and freezing temperatures.
[7470.41s -> 7473.17s]  So I guess if we found.
[7473.17s -> 7474.41s]  Did we not bring a book
[7474.41s -> 7476.41s]  or did we place it somewhere else?
[7476.41s -> 7477.25s]  I don't know.
[7477.25s -> 7478.09s]  The only thing we could do now.
[7478.09s -> 7479.93s]  We had a book.
[7480.25s -> 7481.09s]  Oh, shit.
[7481.09s -> 7482.41s]  The light, I don't think.
[7482.41s -> 7483.25s]  We do.
[7483.25s -> 7484.17s]  It's the thing.
[7484.17s -> 7485.01s]  Do we have any pills?
[7485.01s -> 7485.85s]  No.
[7485.85s -> 7486.69s]  Oh, fuck.
[7486.69s -> 7487.53s]  No.
[7487.53s -> 7488.37s]  I think it's on the ground somewhere.
[7488.37s -> 7489.21s]  Either of us going back out.
[7489.21s -> 7490.41s]  I'm going to guess.
[7490.41s -> 7491.25s]  I think it's demon.
[7491.25s -> 7492.09s]  Fuck it.
[7492.09s -> 7492.93s]  I'm going to guess demon.
[7492.93s -> 7493.77s]  Yeah.
[7493.77s -> 7494.61s]  Yeah, I'm going to guess demon
[7494.61s -> 7496.29s]  based on what I've ruled out here.
[7496.29s -> 7497.13s]  All right.
[7497.13s -> 7497.97s]  We did get some objective.
[7497.97s -> 7500.65s]  That was actually kind of successful.
[7500.65s -> 7501.49s]  For what it was.
[7501.49s -> 7502.33s]  It's getting money.
[7502.33s -> 7503.17s]  Even though two people died.
[7503.17s -> 7504.61s]  I'm so sorry you're in the wrong.
[7504.61s -> 7505.45s]  It's all right.
[7505.45s -> 7507.49s]  We got this, I think.
[7507.49s -> 7508.33s]  I think we still win.
[7508.33s -> 7510.01s]  I can taste that sub.
[7510.01s -> 7510.85s]  That's a win.
[7513.95s -> 7519.52s]  Is it?
[7519.52s -> 7520.68s]  Fuck, it was a shade.
[7520.68s -> 7522.00s]  What?
[7522.00s -> 7523.80s]  Oh.
[7523.80s -> 7525.28s]  EMF.
[7525.28s -> 7526.12s]  I think it was a shade.
[7526.12s -> 7527.35s]  I think it was crawling on the ground.
[7527.35s -> 7531.80s]  It was none of the things that I, it was.
[7531.80s -> 7532.64s]  But I love it.
[7532.64s -> 7533.88s]  All right.
[7533.88s -> 7534.68s]  Well.
[7534.68s -> 7535.68s]  No sub.
[7539.42s -> 7541.14s]  Shit.
[7541.14s -> 7541.98s]  Damn.
[7541.98s -> 7542.82s]  All right.
[7542.82s -> 7544.41s]  Shade, okay.
[7544.41s -> 7545.25s]  Once you start getting the hang of this,
[7545.25s -> 7546.57s]  this game is pretty interesting.
[7546.57s -> 7548.05s]  It's pretty fun.
[7548.05s -> 7548.89s]  Yeah.
[7548.89s -> 7549.73s]  You've got the hang of it.
[7549.81s -> 7551.29s]  Cool.
[7551.29s -> 7553.49s]  Oh, let me make this more accurate to Gmod.
[7553.49s -> 7560.27s]  Hold on.
[7560.27s -> 7564.33s]  I hope that sounds good.
[7564.33s -> 7565.17s]  Cool.
[7565.17s -> 7566.01s]  I'm killing it.
[7566.01s -> 7567.17s]  Did you guys see the ghost out here?
[7567.17s -> 7570.41s]  Did you guys see the thing that's, you know,
[7570.41s -> 7573.81s]  staring at us through the window?
[7573.81s -> 7574.93s]  Oh, I do.
[7574.93s -> 7575.77s]  Mm-hmm.
[7575.77s -> 7578.41s]  It's like looking like the Mario Galaxy 2
[7578.41s -> 7580.33s]  Hell Valley Sky Tree thing.
[7580.33s -> 7581.89s]  Fuck's sake.
[7581.89s -> 7583.09s]  That was very specific.
[7584.43s -> 7585.43s]  Yeah.
[7585.43s -> 7587.07s]  He knows his Mario.
[7587.07s -> 7590.50s]  You're in the, oh, you're in the table.
[7590.50s -> 7593.15s]  You are.
[7593.15s -> 7595.51s]  I was more in the table, but yeah,
[7595.51s -> 7598.75s]  these, in VR, you can pull the basketballs
[7598.75s -> 7601.87s]  through the table and they glitch really nicely.
[7601.87s -> 7603.59s]  I love how it's really nicely.
[7604.47s -> 7605.59s]  Yeah.
[7605.59s -> 7606.75s]  Oh, it's such a nice one.
[7606.75s -> 7609.39s]  I made a career on very nice glitches.
[7609.39s -> 7610.23s]  That's true.
[7611.11s -> 7611.95s]  So.
[7613.11s -> 7613.95s]  It's like, oh.
[7613.95s -> 7614.79s]  Oh.
[7614.79s -> 7617.79s]  Yeah.
[7617.79s -> 7621.84s]  Yo, I spent hours stomping Koopas.
[7621.84s -> 7624.20s]  Someone said Koopas.
[7624.20s -> 7627.32s]  Someone said they gave me a participation sub.
[7627.32s -> 7629.28s]  Chat members, I didn't actually need the subs.
[7629.28s -> 7630.44s]  I'm fine.
[7630.44s -> 7631.28s]  But thank you.
[7631.28s -> 7633.73s]  That's very kind of you.
[7633.73s -> 7634.61s]  All right.
[7634.61s -> 7636.81s]  Well, here, I'll stand up for this one.
[7636.81s -> 7639.46s]  Who is this? Stand up.
[7639.46s -> 7640.30s]  Is this Jerma?
[7640.30s -> 7642.05s]  That's me. Oh, hey, Jerma.
[7642.05s -> 7643.41s]  Jerma, thank you for agreeing to this.
[7643.41s -> 7644.25s]  This was a lot of fun.
[7644.25s -> 7645.45s]  Good Halloween spooks.
[7645.45s -> 7646.73s]  Yeah.
[7646.73s -> 7648.61s]  Yeah, it's always a fun time.
[7648.61s -> 7650.39s]  I like playing games. It is.
[7650.39s -> 7651.63s]  You're very close to comfort there.
[7651.63s -> 7653.23s]  I don't, I have no idea what the hell I'm doing,
[7653.23s -> 7655.88s]  but it's fun to walk around and get scared of stuff.
[7655.92s -> 7658.68s]  But we can, maybe we can be squids one day.
[7658.68s -> 7659.52s]  I don't know.
[7659.52s -> 7660.92s]  We should definitely be squids.
[7660.92s -> 7662.68s]  I 100% agree.
[7662.68s -> 7663.88s]  Okay.
[7663.88s -> 7664.72s]  Cool.
[7664.72s -> 7667.04s]  Liam, it's always, you're Liam, right?
[7667.04s -> 7667.88s]  Yeah.
[7667.88s -> 7668.72s]  Yeah, if you guys want to,
[7668.72s -> 7671.14s]  if all of you want to play squids one day.
[7671.14s -> 7672.98s]  Yeah, I'd be down for squids.
[7672.98s -> 7676.50s]  Liam, do you play, you played squids together?
[7676.50s -> 7678.02s]  Yeah.
[7678.02s -> 7679.50s]  Oh yeah, I just had a random match
[7679.50s -> 7682.42s]  during the Splatfest or whatever.
[7682.42s -> 7686.83s]  So, but yeah, also for the new video, as always.
[7686.83s -> 7688.17s]  Sorry?
[7689.01s -> 7690.22s]  What did you say?
[7690.22s -> 7691.26s]  Good video.
[7691.26s -> 7692.74s]  Oh, thank you.
[7692.74s -> 7693.90s]  Sorry, I thought you said it was mid.
[7693.90s -> 7694.74s]  I was like.
[7694.74s -> 7695.58s]  No, no, no, good.
[7695.58s -> 7697.30s]  No, no, I didn't say mid.
[7697.30s -> 7700.18s]  I said you were mid dunk because you had your arm up
[7700.18s -> 7701.66s]  and you were like in a mid dunk with the ball.
[7701.66s -> 7704.25s]  Oh yeah.
[7704.25s -> 7707.17s]  And Ross, where's Ross?
[7707.17s -> 7709.91s]  Yeah, the one with the basketball.
[7709.91s -> 7714.39s]  Now Ross is doing, yeah, I'll take that.
[7714.39s -> 7717.15s]  Ross is doing a series of things with Minecraft
[7717.15s -> 7717.99s]  with Bounce SMP.
[7717.99s -> 7718.83s]  Oh God.
[7718.95s -> 7720.59s]  Is that what's called SMP?
[7720.59s -> 7722.27s]  Yeah.
[7722.27s -> 7724.15s]  I might be in there at some point, chat.
[7724.15s -> 7725.91s]  I don't know, it'll be after Halloween,
[7725.91s -> 7728.63s]  but you can check out Rossy Streams on,
[7728.63s -> 7730.63s]  are you on Rubber Ross yet or is it Rubber Ninja?
[7730.63s -> 7732.11s]  I am Rubber Ross now, yeah.
[7732.11s -> 7732.95s]  Okay.
[7732.95s -> 7734.03s]  I changed a while ago.
[7734.03s -> 7736.02s]  Okay.
[7736.02s -> 7738.50s]  Alrighty, thanks everyone, I appreciate you.
[7738.50s -> 7739.34s]  Yeah, it was fun.
[7739.34s -> 7740.18s]  Happy Halloween.
[7740.18s -> 7741.00s]  You guys are the best.
[7741.00s -> 7741.84s]  Happy Halloween.
[7741.84s -> 7742.68s]  Happy Halloween.
[7742.68s -> 7743.50s]  Happy Halloween.
[7743.50s -> 7744.34s]  Bye.
[7744.34s -> 7745.18s]  It was a fun time, guys.
[7745.18s -> 7746.00s]  It was fun.
[7746.00s -> 7746.84s]  Goodbye, everybody.
[7746.84s -> 7748.34s]  Goodbye.
[7748.38s -> 7752.48s]  All right, chat, you got me for a couple more minutes.
[7752.48s -> 7755.90s]  Okay, so let me do this.
[7755.90s -> 7758.26s]  Okay, that was fun.
[7758.26s -> 7761.46s]  That was actually pretty scary.
[7761.46s -> 7762.90s]  Welcome back.
[7762.90s -> 7764.98s]  I am going to move from that.
[7764.98s -> 7769.26s]  We are going to open at Dead of Night,
[7769.26s -> 7771.38s]  which is a like FMV horror game.
[7771.38s -> 7773.54s]  I don't know, I've heard it's fucking horrible though.
[7773.54s -> 7775.16s]  I heard it's terrifying.
[7775.16s -> 7776.00s]  I'll be right back.
[7776.00s -> 7779.24s]  I'm gonna pee, I'm gonna get a drink
[7779.24s -> 7781.20s]  and I'll be back in literally two, three minutes.
[7781.20s -> 7782.04s]  Be right back.
