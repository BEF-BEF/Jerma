[552.89s -> 574.09s]  I want anybody to see my armpits, so I'm not lifting my arms up.
[692.86s -> 796.74s]  See my armpits, so I'm not lifting my arms up.
[1056.15s -> 1208.22s]  Can't breathe without these.
[1471.16s -> 1472.20s]  Can't breathe without these.
[1564.66s -> 1596.74s]  Just a little too big.
[1742.39s -> 1766.20s]  Oh, a mailbox! Yay! Whose house is this? This is my house? Let me give it a check.
[1766.20s -> 1774.17s]  Are you in there? Hello? Can you hear me? Why don't we give it one more check?
[1777.53s -> 1782.42s]  The door, I'm here! That was a voice crack in the first 10 seconds.
[1783.22s -> 1797.93s]  All right, it's not bad. It's not bad at all. I mean, I kind of feel like a dickhead.
[1797.93s -> 1799.61s]  Just by the way that I'm dressed, but you know, whatever.
[1800.33s -> 1822.73s]  Refrigerator. Oh, refrigerator! Stove! Oh yes, I love stoves! Sink! Oh my god, I can't believe it.
[1822.73s -> 1828.09s]  How many rooms do I have? Just one, or do I have two? How many do I have?
[1831.67s -> 1840.02s]  Oh, is this a nice bathroom? Spacious, comfortable. I could utilize this. Toilet,
[1842.02s -> 1849.32s]  shower, and sink. Does this sink work too? What do you think? Should we try it? It does.
[1851.14s -> 1858.95s]  A workable sink. I feel pretty good, but that could change really, really quickly. I'll look
[1858.95s -> 1864.63s]  into this one here. Take care of me. Don't fuck around. You've got three streams to do this.
[1865.59s -> 1879.67s]  I'm just gonna go, I'm gonna go in the kitchen. Whatever. Why not? Is there anything even in the
[1879.67s -> 1887.64s]  fridge? I don't even know if there's anything in here. I see something I like in there.
[1891.51s -> 1898.14s]  Wash my hands really quickly. Welcome to the dollhouse though. Got a few things you might
[1898.14s -> 1905.77s]  need to take care of. Got a few needs. I just saw somebody said starve him. I want that person
[1905.77s -> 1927.27s]  timed out for an hour. So what I want to do is I, I want to go, what I want to do is I want to
[1927.27s -> 1946.39s]  use the bathroom. It took me a while to be, how am I using my hands?
[1949.21s -> 1950.89s]  You know what? I don't even, I don't even need to hold it.
[1951.61s -> 1953.53s]  I want to give the toilet a flush, why don't we?
[1964.76s -> 1976.30s]  That was a long one, I think. That took a little while. Hey, Jerry. Get this thing out of the way.
[1976.94s -> 1981.50s]  Do I have to wear, oh, this shit the whole time, by the way. Do I have to wear this the whole time?
[1982.63s -> 1995.98s]  I'm like on fire right now. This helmet, this helmet is making me sweat. I like the shower.
[1996.54s -> 2004.52s]  It's beautiful. That's really what it is. And I'm taking this off because I, I, I don't want it on
[2004.52s -> 2012.36s]  anymore. I just don't, it's too hot. That's just the way it is. So I'm, I'm looking, what I'm looking
[2012.36s -> 2016.60s]  for for you to do is I'm looking for you to take care of me. Take good care of me. Don't, I want
[2016.60s -> 2023.30s]  to be, I want to sleep well eight hours a night. I feel like I'm presenting like a, I feel like I'm
[2023.30s -> 2028.82s]  presenting a, like an infomercial. Hey, does your toilet, does your toilet do this? Does your
[2028.82s -> 2040.04s]  toilet do this? Well it does because that means it's working. What do I want to do? This is what
[2040.04s -> 2049.99s]  happens when you, when you're just in this world. What happens is it's got a really bad migraine
[2049.99s -> 2053.99s]  that's making, I don't want to go that way though. I want to go back in the bathroom. What am I doing?
[2053.99s -> 2061.64s]  I want to take a jog. For what? I don't, I don't jog. Okay, I'm gonna, I didn't even lock the door.
[2063.64s -> 2067.40s]  I gotta lock the door. Somebody lock the door. Why am I doing this? I don't want to fucking go here.
[2068.20s -> 2092.34s]  There are cars on this road. There are cars on the street. All right, I, when can I stop doing this?
[2093.22s -> 2115.96s]  I'm starting to stink. All right, I'm going back in. I'm going back in. I'm going back in. I'm not
[2115.96s -> 2130.18s]  wearing that helmet either. Oh wait, anybody in here? Hold on. I'm gonna have to get, I'm gonna
[2130.18s -> 2139.70s]  have to get an electrician to look at that. Oh, I smell awful. I gotta like feel awful too.
[2140.42s -> 2154.39s]  Let me wash my hands. That was a fucking big run. All right, we can just chill. I don't have to do
[2154.39s -> 2175.45s]  anything. I don't have to go anywhere. God, this is awful. Can I go? Why can I not, that one, I can't,
[2175.45s -> 2205.26s]  I don't know what, that one doesn't do anything. Why? I, I, why am I going outside? Why am I going
[2205.26s -> 2211.62s]  outside? What are you doing? Hey, I don't, wait a fucking second, all right? I'm not going out there
[2211.62s -> 2227.30s]  yet. I don't want to go out. This is a beautiful day out here. Wow. Look at those birds. This is
[2227.30s -> 2245.26s]  pretty nice. I like this. Look at these flowers. They're beautiful. I smell so bad. Take care of
[2245.26s -> 2259.37s]  me for God's sake. What about, how about another one? Going back in. That was beautiful though.
[2263.67s -> 2272.62s]  I have sweating through my clothes and I mean that in like, in real life and in fake life.
[2273.98s -> 2282.94s]  So it makes sense that I would be like this. You'll have a series of choices. I hope you
[2282.94s -> 2295.78s]  choose wisely and when you have these choices to make, I really hope that, I feel like shit.
[2296.34s -> 2300.74s]  I hope that when you make these choices that you do them in a way that it can succeed all of us.
[2301.38s -> 2314.34s]  I think I need to fucking lie down. Um, what was I saying? I wanted to go for a hot jog or something.
[2314.90s -> 2324.34s]  I feel awful. I'm getting like a bad headache and shit. I'm like really tired. I really just kind of
[2324.34s -> 2332.02s]  want to like, that's probably, there's, over here, I think that's a good spot I sure went.
[2669.00s -> 2678.49s]  Oh, that was fucking hell. I feel like somebody just punched me in the face like three times.
[2679.29s -> 2685.19s]  I feel like I just, I had this weird vision, this weird dream with this
[2685.19s -> 2708.42s]  like sleep paralysis demon just surrounding me. Oh, ow, my knees. What's that? What is this?
[2712.18s -> 2718.42s]  Is this a, what was a stool? I don't like that there. That's not what that should be. I don't
[2718.42s -> 2724.22s]  like that. I don't like it. But I'll tell you what I do like. I like sassy sunglasses.
[2725.18s -> 2746.89s]  How am I supposed to go to the bathroom in this? I am disgusting. Someone please help me. Can I,
[2746.89s -> 2753.90s]  please just put me into a bathing scenario. I am here washing my hands desperately. Let,
[2753.90s -> 2769.11s]  please let me bathe. Put me into a scenario where I can clean my body. Trash. Sink.
[2771.13s -> 2788.49s]  I need to clean myself. You can't just let me fucking be like this. Give me a break.
[2791.45s -> 2799.75s]  Ah, I better, I hope that nobody comes over because this is absolutely revolting.
[2801.66s -> 2805.58s]  What if my mother shows up? Huh? What if, what if my mother decides to come in here?
[2806.30s -> 2811.59s]  You know what she'd say? She'd be disgusted. She would put her face in the air and she would run
[2811.59s -> 2825.85s]  away. What if my mother shows up? What if my mother shows up? All right. No, no, no, no, no,
[2825.85s -> 2828.57s]  no, no, no, no, not with the stool there. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[2828.57s -> 2837.37s]  okay, okay. I guess I have to go to the bathroom now. On the stool. Now I'm peeing on the stool.
[2837.37s -> 2855.64s]  We gotta poop the stool. I don't want to pee on the stool. Very good. Very good. Very good. Very
[2855.64s -> 2860.20s]  good. I can't even use that. That's supposed to be a place to sit down. That's a place for me to sit
[2860.20s -> 2871.43s]  and relax. Can I take a shower? Can I just take one? I want to. I want to. Right now.
[2871.99s -> 2882.44s]  I would love to take a shower right at this moment. I want to take a shower. Put me in the shower.
[2882.44s -> 2890.09s]  I'm waiting. I'm waiting to go in the shower. I don't want to go to work. I want to go in the
[2890.09s -> 2921.22s]  shower. You know, I can't go in front of people like this. Shut up, dog. I like mailboxes. I love
[2921.22s -> 2930.46s]  them. Thank God. Am I going where I think you are? Am I going where I think you're going?
[2931.10s -> 2933.82s]  Please tell me you're going this way. Are you going this way? Please say yes.
[2934.62s -> 2937.82s]  Don't make me like take a shit in the toilet for like a second. I haven't even taken shit yet.
[2937.82s -> 2940.78s]  Whatever. You know what I'm saying? Thank God. Am I going there? I am going there. Thank God.
[2941.98s -> 2957.35s]  Oh my God. They picked it. Thank goodness. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, this feels so much better.
[2959.86s -> 2962.60s]  Hey, look at me. Look at me.
[2983.54s -> 2990.68s]  Well, maybe you do, right? Maybe I do sometimes. Sometimes you just got to let the water hit you
[2990.68s -> 3002.62s]  right in the face, right in the face. There it is. That feels so much better. Oh my goodness.
[3010.18s -> 3016.36s]  I'm not naked anymore. All right, we're good. We're good. We're fine. We're fine.
[3017.24s -> 3022.47s]  Oh, I feel so much better. I'm fucking hungry though. If I'm not going to go to work and I'm
[3022.47s -> 3026.86s]  not going to make money, then you got to make me food. Stupid. I should have called you stupid.
[3026.86s -> 3045.58s]  That was mean. I just want to sit over here, put the hat on. I want food and I want it.
[3049.26s -> 3054.86s]  I don't need to go to the fucking bathroom again. Something's going on with this toilet.
[3054.86s -> 3059.18s]  Something's going on with this toilet. Okay. All right. The toilet's like pissing at me.
[3059.18s -> 3065.74s]  The toilet is effectively peeing at me and I didn't even sit on it. It's just broken.
[3066.46s -> 3074.20s]  The toilet's broken. What the fuck? I didn't even have a chance to sit on it. Oh my God.
[3074.84s -> 3086.38s]  I don't know how to turn it off. What the fuck? I didn't even sit on it. Okay. I think it's clean.
[3086.38s -> 3090.78s]  I think it's good. No, it's not. No, it's not. It's fucking still pissing out.
[3092.46s -> 3097.67s]  I've used this toilet twice. I don't know what to do about that. All right, I'm going over here.
[3100.55s -> 3110.23s]  It's just like peed all over me. I was going to use the bathroom. All right, all right. I'll
[3110.23s -> 3116.17s]  put the clothes on. Okay. Here, let's put them on. Can I just take the stupid thing out? I hate this
[3116.17s -> 3124.92s]  thing. What am I going to do about that? I can't go to the bathroom. I need to eat. Make some
[3124.92s -> 3133.64s]  decisions. How am I going to call repairman when I don't have a phone? I'm going to have to like
[3133.64s -> 3151.88s]  scream out the window. I need a repairman, but I don't have a telephone. If anybody in this
[3151.88s -> 3155.72s]  neighborhood is a repairman or a repair woman, I could really use your help right now.
[3158.04s -> 3174.52s]  Fuck you, dog. What'd he say? I have a telephone, but if you could show up, that would be fantastic.
[3175.40s -> 3185.38s]  I'm starving. I haven't eaten in two days. I haven't eaten in two days. What the, who the
[3185.46s -> 3191.62s]  zoo's at? I'm feeling like faint. I haven't eaten in two days. I feel fucking terrible. Who's at the
[3191.62s -> 3202.10s]  door? Hello? Got a clogged shitter? Yeah, I guess. Not really. I haven't taken a shit in it since I've
[3202.10s -> 3212.58s]  moved here. So that's, I guess, technically, how much is this going to cost? I haven't taken, I
[3212.58s -> 3216.81s]  haven't gone to the bathroom. By the way, I'm sorry I look like this. It was chosen for me. The
[3216.81s -> 3221.29s]  toilet's in here, by the way. Yeah. I don't know what's going on. It just started leaking and,
[3221.93s -> 3225.29s]  yeah. I'm really, I'm really happy, in fact, that you live in the neighborhood. In fact,
[3225.29s -> 3227.85s]  you heard me and you were ready to work and you had your work clothes on and you had to
[3227.85s -> 3232.31s]  buckle with you. That's really, really helpful. Yeah, it's just going. I don't know what to do.
[3239.18s -> 3246.46s]  Yeah, it's just spraying water. Yes, it is. I haven't used it, so I don't know what to do about it.
[3247.10s -> 3249.34s]  I have no idea what you want. This is what I'm supposed to do.
[3249.74s -> 3259.64s]  Oh, it just cost money. How much money does this cost? There's so much water over here.
[3260.87s -> 3269.93s]  What am I doing? What, you, I, oh my, look over there. Don't look. Look over there.
[3271.66s -> 3276.22s]  Don't look, don't look over here. Don't look over here. In fact, get out of the room.
[3277.18s -> 3315.66s]  No, don't. The toilet's fixed. I don't know. I didn't want to go in the shower.
[3321.43s -> 3333.38s]  Okay. I'm fine. I'm back. I'm back. Ready to go. You motherfuckers. I swear to God.
[3333.94s -> 3368.71s]  I'm fucking starving too. Where did, where did they go? Where is she? I didn't. I'm fucking
[3368.71s -> 3382.31s]  starving right now and I need food and I need it now. Make it happen. Thank God. Finally,
[3382.31s -> 3403.38s]  some mac and cheese. Mac and cheese. Thank God. Finally get to eat some damn food. I guess I'm
[3404.52s -> 3447.14s]  out of my finger. Just get some. Okay. Shit. Give it a minute. I'm not having a good time right now.
[3447.94s -> 3458.50s]  I didn't want to fucking, I wanted to pay the person for the love of God. I just want to
[3458.50s -> 3466.33s]  fucking have some food and shit. And like, I would, I'm like, feel fucking terrible.
[3479.19s -> 3502.65s]  I don't fucking care. I'm fucking not having a good time. This is good though.
[3508.01s -> 3525.58s]  I need something to do. Give me something to do. Get this hat off too. It's, it's
[3525.58s -> 3542.07s]  constricting. I don't like it. I don't care. I'm not happy. I can't do that. I'm, I'm so stressed.
[3543.72s -> 3793.46s]  I'm not do. I can't. It's on me. What's on me? What is that? Does it break into my fucking
[3793.46s -> 3809.37s]  apartment? Break into my house? Okay. Um, I don't hate it. I think it's kind of ugly and it smells.
[3810.25s -> 3833.16s]  Uh, okay. It's kind of comfy. I like it, but I, but I don't like it.
[3833.96s -> 3846.87s]  I don't want to sit on a dirty bed in a dirty fucking place. Okay. I am nothing is I'm not
[3846.87s -> 3852.55s]  having a good time at all at all. And I blame you guys. I blame it's your fault that I don't feel
[3852.55s -> 3858.28s]  good because you have so many opportunities to make me feel better. And you put, there's a mattress
[3858.36s -> 3864.52s]  and like a stool that I piss on. That's fantastic. I, whatever. I don't even fucking care.
[3865.56s -> 3876.52s]  I don't fucking care at all actually. And you guys fucked it up. Does the toilet even work?
[3876.52s -> 3880.60s]  I don't even know. I didn't want to fucking do that stupid shit that you guys did.
[3888.82s -> 3953.77s]  Well, it works and it works so good. It works twice. I don't have anything to make them
[3953.77s -> 3970.65s]  do. Fuck off. I don't care. There, I made the bed for you. Any fucking way for me to live?
[3971.61s -> 3990.38s]  Who? What? Um, who the, who are they? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, get off. No, no, no, no, no,
[3990.38s -> 3999.10s]  no, no. Off the bed. I don't want a cookie. Get, get that cookie away from me. I don't want a
[3999.10s -> 4007.38s]  cookie. Fucking weirdos. That's hilarious. Hilarious. Get away from me. I don't want it.
[4014.97s -> 4031.50s]  Ah, I'm in here. Don't come in. Give me your weapon. Okay. It's a little funny. It's okay.
[4031.50s -> 4044.39s]  It's a little bit funny. It's kind of funny. This is actually kind of cool. You're, you're crazy.
[4045.27s -> 4056.28s]  Ah, I didn't, that's okay. Oh man. What, uh, what are you doing? What are you doing?
[4057.16s -> 4067.96s]  What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? Uh, um, that's, no, no, no, no, you can't, you can't
[4067.96s -> 4071.80s]  just take whatever you want out of there. You can't just take everything you want. You can't
[4071.80s -> 4083.50s]  just take whatever you want. Get me something I can just swing at him. I'm going outside. I'm
[4083.50s -> 4087.99s]  going outside. I'm not fucking doing this. I mean, you're funny. It was pretty funny, but please
[4087.99s -> 4097.16s]  leave me alone. Please leave me alone. What did you do to my front door? I gotta go to work?
[4097.88s -> 4107.29s]  What did you, you motherfuckers broke my front door. I can't even fix this.
[4110.89s -> 4117.61s]  Why am I still holding the balloon? Why am I holding the balloon still? I don't want this.
[4124.49s -> 4128.73s]  That to go to work? I don't have to go to work, right? How much money do I have left?
[4131.11s -> 4135.83s]  This is my, no, no, no, no, no, no, excuse me. This is my house. I'm like, why am I hiding
[4135.83s -> 4141.75s]  outside of my own house? I'm hiding. I need to eat out of that peanut butter later. Now I'm not
[4141.75s -> 4148.23s]  going to. I'm not eating out of that peanut butter. I'm not going to work. I don't want to
[4148.23s -> 4151.75s]  go to work. I'm not eating out of that peanut butter. I know I'm supposed to, but I'm not going
[4151.75s -> 4156.87s]  to. I'm fucking telling you right now, I'm not eating that peanut butter. All right. I'm going
[4156.87s -> 4162.10s]  to work. Fine. Goodbye. Take this and fucking leave, whatever. They're fucking taking over. I
[4162.74s -> 4164.10s]  wait for me. I'm going to work.
[4413.00s -> 4418.86s]  Thank you. Thanks for the ride. I know it was a little weird. I'm sorry. I know I just had a
[4418.86s -> 4423.42s]  lot of shit going on and I'm sorry that I may have smelled up your entire car.
[4424.70s -> 4430.52s]  It just, they're gone already, but whatever. Thank you. I'll see you again. Whenever I go to work again.
[4438.25s -> 4448.62s]  Mess. Somebody's going to have to clean that up. I just want to let everybody make sure everybody's
[4448.62s -> 4453.90s]  wear this. There's peanut butter all over the door handles and it's actually like actually
[4453.90s -> 4457.50s]  gross. So I'm going to have to figure out what to do about that. And this is, this is a disaster.
[4459.18s -> 4467.11s]  Great. Cookies everywhere. The peanut butter. What did he drink? This is his drink. He drank a whole
[4467.11s -> 4486.54s]  beer in like five seconds. I'm fucking tired. I'm disgusting and I need food. Okay. They're still
[4486.54s -> 4495.50s]  here. What's going on in there? That's funny. There's just clowns drinking beer in my house.
[4497.66s -> 4504.14s]  Yeah. That's, that's hilarious. All right. Don't now get, move, move, move out, out, out.
[4505.62s -> 4518.09s]  Why are they still here? I'm too tired for this shit. Get out. Move. What was that?
[4518.97s -> 4531.86s]  Somebody got like shot. This is a mess in here. It's a mess. Am I taking a shower? Am I going to
[4531.86s -> 4539.32s]  get in there? I'm getting in. What are the, what'd they say? Am I getting in? Oh, I'm going to get
[4539.32s -> 4550.33s]  naked. Okay. I'm getting naked. I'm in the shower. There we are. All right. This is feeling much
[4550.33s -> 4560.15s]  better. Please don't get the clouds out of here. I think I can like sense them. I can actually sense
[4560.15s -> 4571.80s]  the clowns inside and somebody's in here. Don't come in. Somebody's in here. Somebody's in the
[4571.80s -> 4588.98s]  bathroom. Don't come in. That's very universal. I know it. So I, okay. Okay. We're good. Ah,
[4588.98s -> 4596.01s]  fresh, but very tired. Very, very tired. Why is it fucking wet peanut butter on every handle?
[4607.88s -> 4617.11s]  You're not going to drink milk out of the jug. You're not going to drink milk out of the jug.
[4617.11s -> 4622.63s]  Like that's just fucking gross. And I don't even know which one of us farted,
[4622.63s -> 4628.07s]  but somebody did. Somebody farted. All right. Please. I'm starving. Just leave me alone.
[4629.03s -> 4635.75s]  Take all. Okay. This is fantastic. All right. Get out of the house. Out. You're out. You're out.
[4635.75s -> 4644.12s]  You're out. Out. Out. Get out of the house. Now. Go. Go. Go. You. Help him, please. I won't even
[4644.12s -> 4652.34s]  touch him. Just get him out. Next time, I want to stick big enough to swing. That's, yeah. But I
[4652.34s -> 4657.50s]  feel good, by the way. Thanks for the help. I appreciate it. I think somebody just said,
[4657.58s -> 4669.34s]  red Andy. It's hot up here. All right. I need to actual like wipe these down. There's fucking
[4669.34s -> 4677.32s]  peanut butter everywhere. I'm exhausted and I'm starving. You're going to have to pick one
[4677.32s -> 4686.47s]  because I don't know what to do. Let me just wipe the handles. He, he like got his hands on
[4686.47s -> 4698.12s]  the peanut butter and it was just disgusting. I'm so tired. Give me something to fucking play
[4698.12s -> 4705.66s]  with or something, please. For the love of God. It is filthy in this bathroom. There's water. There's
[4705.66s -> 4717.88s]  dirt. No, I'm not. No, I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to make a peanut. I'm not making
[4717.88s -> 4724.86s]  peanut butter and jelly. I'm not. He put his hand in that. I'm not going to eat out of that.
[4726.22s -> 4729.58s]  He actually put his hands inside the peanut butter and like he ate his with his fingers
[4729.58s -> 4734.78s]  and put his hands back in. So I have to eat it. They want me to eat a peanut butter and jelly
[4734.78s -> 4752.23s]  sandwich. Let me at least get the peanut butter off the handles. It's a disaster. I got to take
[4752.23s -> 4758.78s]  the trash out too. Eventually. I got a lot of shit. Hold on. I look at all this. This is ridiculous.
[4760.54s -> 4772.58s]  I'm going to fucking pass out too. I don't want any of this. Drinking my beer.
[4776.31s -> 4797.03s]  Can I find it? That's his finger. That's his thumb. That's a, that's a literal thumb print in here.
[4805.27s -> 4810.82s]  I literally, a sitcom audience just laughed over here. I just heard it. That was revolting.
[4814.44s -> 4824.04s]  Damn clowns. I'm so tired, but you have no idea. I need a utensil to do this with at least.
[4828.18s -> 4836.07s]  Oh shit, plastic, plastic, plastic, plastic. I don't want to cook this. Get this out of the way.
[4836.07s -> 4844.86s]  Why would you cook a peanut butter sandwich? I'm not cooking. I'm not cooking anything.
[4845.82s -> 4859.67s]  Who does like a peanut butter sandwich on the stove? I need this bad, but let's go around the
[4859.67s -> 4877.96s]  fingerprint. Oh, I can see it. I'm just going to have a little. I need to, I got to put this
[4877.96s -> 4883.90s]  somewhere where I can actually use it here. What a sad peanut butter and jelly sandwich, but there's
[4883.90s -> 4892.44s]  no jelly and a clown put his hand in it. This is good. Like that. It's really hot in my house. I
[4892.44s -> 4901.58s]  don't even have air conditioning. I know there's milk in the fridge, but the clown drank that too
[4902.14s -> 4913.70s]  directly out of the job. He ruined everything. He ruined my entire fridge. That motherfucker did
[4913.70s -> 4946.50s]  what? This is good. I'm fucking tired. That's bringing me back to life. Thank you. I have to
[4946.50s -> 4963.98s]  pee bad though, or I don't know. I have to do one or the other. It feels much better. I need to pee.
[4964.70s -> 4982.14s]  I need to use the bathroom. I didn't even sit down. Why is there already something in here?
[4984.74s -> 5022.17s]  I'm not doing that, but I'm not doing that again. I'll pee in it. Okay. I'm not going to do the
[5022.17s -> 5463.64s]  other thing. That feels better. So tired. I'm so fucking tired. Um, nothing in here. I keep waking
[5463.64s -> 5477.67s]  up to new shit in my house. Apparently not today. Everything here that was supposed to be here,
[5478.39s -> 5499.10s]  those weirdos were here, but great. That's where that goes.
[5525.69s -> 5535.30s]  Oh, popcorn. I love popcorn maker. What? Oh, this is awesome. Popcorn. It's a popcorn maker.
[5535.30s -> 5551.50s]  It creates popcorn out of thin air. Oh, the mail too. Why is there food in here?
[5551.90s -> 5566.28s]  Is everybody like left something? Um, okay. This is from the neighbors, I guess. Well, thank you.
[5566.28s -> 5571.32s]  Thank you, whoever you are. I really appreciate it. Thanks for coming and fixing the toilet too.
[5571.32s -> 5574.60s]  I know you can hear me because everyone has their windows open and everyone's ready for work
[5575.48s -> 5587.32s]  at all times apparently. How much money do I have? I need money. What are you guys buying?
[5587.32s -> 5591.48s]  You're buying all this shit. What am I going to do with the popcorn maker? I mean, I like it. I love
[5591.48s -> 5610.58s]  it. I mean, I love popcorn maker, but, um, I mean, what am I going to do with this? Did you buy me
[5610.58s -> 5626.02s]  popcorn kernels too? Cause I mean, this is cool. Let me plug it in. I don't, I, this is a disaster
[5626.02s -> 5635.46s]  in here. It's a fucking mess. I can't do anything. I don't even have popcorn kernels. I'll put it up
[5635.46s -> 5646.63s]  here. Maybe I'll use it. Maybe I'll use it later. I can't even go anywhere. I don't, I don't like
[5646.63s -> 5651.43s]  this living situation at all. I don't like the bed being here. I don't like the, you know what?
[5655.72s -> 5658.60s]  This is disgusting. I don't know where this is. I don't know where this is from. I don't know where
[5658.60s -> 5665.45s]  this, what this has been, but I don't want it in my house. I'm sorry. I'm just going to be honest.
[5667.85s -> 5680.31s]  Time for work. I'm coming. Hold on a second. I got to test my doorbell.
[5681.27s -> 5694.22s]  All right. All right. All right. I'm going to be late. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[5720.50s -> 5722.25s]  Tough day at work.
[5730.98s -> 5742.70s]  See you at the party on Saturday. Did I really want to invite everybody in that car? Probably not.
[5753.29s -> 5757.37s]  Are they still out? Why are they still here? Did I leave, did I leave my phone in the car?
[5758.33s -> 5773.18s]  What if I did though? What if I never get to make a phone call for the rest of my life?
[5774.14s -> 5783.02s]  What if I can't make a phone call for the rest of my entire life? Right? Like I have to go to the
[5783.02s -> 5787.90s]  fucking phone store. I got to get a new phone. I have to like call and redo everybody's numbers
[5787.90s -> 5801.48s]  and stuff. I just, I don't want to do that. Give me this. You won't fucking.
[5801.48s -> 5877.00s]  Okay. Can you guys buy a lock for the door? I'm not answering the door. I'm literally not.
[5877.00s -> 5884.86s]  I just, I don't have to answer the door. I'm not answering the door. They can stay out there.
[5895.78s -> 5898.82s]  I'm not going to let them into the house because like I saw, I don't want another
[5898.82s -> 5913.54s]  finger in my peanut bar. These are good. I'm not letting them in. I'm not sure what happened last
[5913.54s -> 5944.49s]  time. Come on. It's really. Oh, God damn it. Hold on. Wait a minute. You can't come in here.
[5944.49s -> 5952.52s]  You can't come in here. You can't come in here. I don't know how they got in. Why are they allowed
[5952.52s -> 5975.82s]  in the house? Why are they allowed in the house? What happened? What happened? What happened? What
[5975.82s -> 5985.59s]  happened? Somebody's touching my face. Somebody's on me. Somebody's on me. I'm not gonna eat a piece
[5985.59s -> 5990.39s]  of pizza with whipped cream on it. Okay. Get the fuck out of here. I'm not going to eat that.
[5990.39s -> 5997.45s]  I'm not going to eat it. I'm not going to eat this. I don't know what this is. I don't know
[5997.45s -> 6006.81s]  what this is. It's like a kid's school project. No, get away from me. I don't even know what they're
[6006.81s -> 6018.23s]  doing here. I don't even know why they're even in here. Why don't I have permanent clowns? Take
[6018.23s -> 6026.07s]  this back. Okay. I don't know what you have, but I can't see. I can't see. I need help with something.
[6026.07s -> 6081.72s]  Please. No, no, no. I'm not taking a shower. I'm hiding. Are they gone? Oh, no. What gave it away?
[6155.75s -> 6164.28s]  I gotta find the fuse box. I gotta find the fuse box. Oh, my face. The fuse box is back here.
[6166.52s -> 6175.59s]  Close the door. Close the door. It's over here somewhere. I think I found it. God damn it.
[6178.50s -> 6185.93s]  Where is it? It's back here in this little cubby hole. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. My fingers.
[6187.05s -> 6194.84s]  Ow, shit. That hurt. Oh, my hand. All right. How do I get back into the house?
[6202.55s -> 6209.61s]  My hands. All right. Out, out, out. Power's back on. Get out. Out, out of the house. Out of the house.
[6209.61s -> 6212.57s]  Out of the house. Out of the house now. Out of the house right now.
[6213.53s -> 6222.62s]  Now. Now, don't come back. And you're not invited to the party. Oh, God. Don't come back.
[6233.00s -> 6249.70s]  I burnt the shit out of my hand going back there. I'm so tired. I'm exhausted. I can't. I'm not
[6249.70s -> 6280.57s]  going to. You want to play outside? Great. It is soaking wet out here. Disgusting. I'm playing
[6280.65s -> 6301.38s]  outside, apparently. Why do I think that's playing? Christmas time. I love Christmas.
[6305.40s -> 6308.92s]  This is, you got to choose sleep sometimes, guys, because this is how you fuck me up for the rest of
[6308.92s -> 6735.30s]  the week. Oh, pee. Oh, this is ridiculous. I've only lived here for like fucking four days.
[6737.34s -> 6746.94s]  It's like a throw a party. Oh, hey. Ha ha. Make sure the doorbell works. I'm not even going to do it.
[6755.37s -> 6780.94s]  So what happened? The popcorn machine. What's new? Oh, phone. Telephone. Finally. I can make
[6780.94s -> 6789.35s]  telephone calls. I don't have to scream out my window. I messed up something over here.
[6790.15s -> 6811.29s]  I ripped up some tiles. How does it work? Hello? I don't know. How's the phone? Hello. Yes, this is
[6811.93s -> 6819.05s]  control speaking. Hello. Yes, this is control speaking. How is the spaceship doing?
[6821.83s -> 6833.83s]  I don't know. I don't know how to use that. Wait, call. Oh, I'm going to piss. See how mom's doing.
[6834.39s -> 6858.01s]  Hey, mom. Hey. It's just, it's, it's Jerma. Well, you know me as Jeremy, mom. Well, you know me
[6858.01s -> 6864.58s]  as Jeremy. Of course, mom. Yeah, I'm doing okay. I'm doing fine. Yeah. I just, um, I just moved in.
[6865.38s -> 6871.02s]  Been here for four or five days or so. It's been great. It's really good to hear your voice too.
[6872.18s -> 6876.66s]  I'm sorry. I kind of like disappeared. Yeah. I have had no way to communicate with me at all.
[6883.53s -> 6889.86s]  Now it's very, yeah, that's funny. Wait, what did dad do? Are you kidding me? No, it's good. I just
[6889.86s -> 6895.11s]  wish there was more electricity. I have one outlet. Yeah. I've never heard of a house before that had
[6895.11s -> 6906.65s]  one outlet, but you know, this plumbing, it works. It's comfy. It's cozy. Mom, I, uh, it's been really
[6906.65s -> 6911.05s]  good to hear your voice, but I definitely have to go. Uh, I've got to go. I've got to get off the
[6911.05s -> 6917.45s]  phone and yes, yes, I've got to go. I've got to go. I've got to get off the phone. I've got to get
[6917.45s -> 6920.57s]  off the phone. If we're going, I'm, I'm going to go pee with you on the phone and I'm going to
[6920.57s -> 6932.68s]  hang up after goodbye. Mom, it's not just gonna see you. I'm not gonna, I'm not going to piss or
[6932.68s -> 6942.14s]  like shit on the phone with my mother. I'm sorry. Like you picked it too late. There you are. Not
[6942.14s -> 6951.75s]  going to happen. Ah, it feels pretty good. That was a good call though. Good. It's good to talk
[6951.75s -> 6966.50s]  to my mom. Ah, it feels good now. Life is good. I feel good. I feel like I look good.
[6967.22s -> 6976.65s]  Too much stuff though. I just, I wish I could just get rid of this stuff.
[6977.37s -> 6982.76s]  Do you see what happened over here? This is, this is a slice of pizza here with like whipped cream
[6982.76s -> 6988.38s]  on it. I don't want that. I want to get rid of it. I don't want that. I'm in my house anymore.
[6989.10s -> 7009.82s]  Time to go to work. Let's go. Be there in a sec. Time to make some money.
[7076.81s -> 7286.38s]  Bye. Bye. Thank you for the ride again.
[7319.64s -> 7334.70s]  Tired, hungry, all the above, all of the above. Ridiculous. That was a rough day at work too,
[7335.67s -> 7354.49s]  but I made some money, you know, and that's the good thing. That feels better. Oh my goodness.
[7354.49s -> 7381.70s]  I feel like a thousand dollars more than I did earlier. Oh, thank God. I'll have some of this.
[7387.72s -> 7425.54s]  If I can even get it in, it doesn't do anything. You know what? I'm going to have some cereal.
[7434.79s -> 7453.93s]  Cereal sounds good to me. Am I peeing? What? Am I peeing? What happened? Why was I just peeing?
[7459.67s -> 7474.34s]  Oh, it was a sizzle. I was like, why am I pissing? All right. I think, wait, shower. I'm not done.
[7484.60s -> 7500.87s]  I can't take a shower with the food. All right. Maybe I can. Oh, it's getting all in there. It's
[7500.87s -> 7509.05s]  getting all soggy. It's all getting soggy. That was like Peter Griffin. I just realized that.
[7510.44s -> 7517.03s]  It's getting soggy. Oh, but killing two birds with one stone though. This is good.
[7534.38s -> 7559.67s]  Starting to feel better. Life's coming back. Life is coming back into me.
[7565.06s -> 7615.70s]  Oh, I'm just tired. Unhappy. What? What's in the mail? What? I got a piece of mail. What's it say?
[7621.38s -> 7635.05s]  $500. An inheritance. $750. I misread it in my glasses. $750 from Dear Uncle Ted. No way. What an
[7635.05s -> 7655.40s]  inheritance. What did he leave me? His weight set? Was that rain? That's a huge deal. All right.
[7656.42s -> 7672.33s]  That's money. That's big money. I was sad before, but that's another $750. How much money do I have
[7672.33s -> 7683.38s]  in my bank now? How much money have I got? Do I have more than $500? Like $1,200? Holy shit.
[7683.86s -> 7726.71s]  This floor is filthy. Hello? Mom? Yeah. I know. I heard about Uncle Ted. Yeah. Yeah, I know. He
[7726.71s -> 7736.18s]  sent me some. Did he send you anything? No. Yeah. I got $750 in an envelope. It was a check, but
[7736.18s -> 7748.39s]  still. How are you doing? Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean, it's really nice of him. What did he give you?
[7749.11s -> 7759.70s]  You got $10,000. That's awesome. Hell yeah. That's awesome. Well, that's sad, but I got money.
[7762.28s -> 7769.29s]  When did he send it? Why would he send it? Oh, his inheritance. That's right. That's right. That's
[7769.29s -> 7777.16s]  right. So it was split up across the whole family. Oh, there's a house too. Wow. That's very
[7777.16s -> 7783.35s]  interesting. Yeah. Yeah. I know. That's sad. Well, I mean, he left some stuff for everybody.
[7783.35s -> 7792.92s]  It's really cool. It's really nice of him. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll talk to you soon. Yeah. All
[7792.92s -> 7804.26s]  right, ma. All right, ma. Yeah. Yeah. We'll figure it out. Yeah. Love you too. That's right. That's
[7804.26s -> 7807.14s]  what you say. You love you to your mother. You haven't talked to your mother lately?
[7807.14s -> 7813.77s]  Say call her and say, I love you. Do it. You do it. Do it tonight. Don't wait. Mother's important.
[7813.77s -> 7832.92s]  She's very important. Right in the bed. Finally. The first night I've actually been able to sleep
[7832.92s -> 7840.02s]  in the bed. It's been a very long, that was the mattress that I, that was the mattress. That wasn't
[7840.02s -> 7846.84s]  me. That was the mattress. It's like the fart stream. It's the fart stream. I got to get comfy.
[7846.84s -> 8247.86s]  Hold on. That was pretty, that was not bad for the first time ever being able to sleep on this bed.
[8247.86s -> 8263.38s]  Uh, I feel a little groggy, but it's okay. I didn't have one of those weird sleep paralysis
[8263.38s -> 8284.54s]  dreams. Not last night. Filthy. I hate it in here. I can't even be in here. I literally cannot even
[8284.54s -> 8314.71s]  be in this room. What? I don't know. What happened? Can I at least get rid of some of this stuff?
[8315.35s -> 8325.99s]  It's ridiculous. It's, that's just, no. I'm cleaning up a little just to be able to walk around again.
[8325.99s -> 8366.62s]  What? It looks very broken from what I can tell. Am I gonna, can I even go to work? I don't think
[8366.62s -> 8380.57s]  I can even go to work if you wanted me to. I'm going, I'm going out the window. I'm going out
[8380.57s -> 8387.19s]  the window. I can't, you didn't close the window. I'm going out the window. Yeah, I'm going out.
[8398.52s -> 8419.48s]  Seeing fucking Ace Ventura when he's coming out the rhino's ass. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Hey, yay, bed.
[8422.18s -> 8440.39s]  Bed. I love, I love what you've done with the bed. Why does everything have to go in the yard?
[8441.11s -> 8452.15s]  You have to put everything in the yard? Any mail today? No. Well, at least I can, I'm not climbing
[8452.15s -> 8457.19s]  back in, so send me to fucking work, okay? I'm not gonna, I'm not climbing, I'm not gonna climb back
[8457.19s -> 8471.06s]  in the window. I'm going to work. I'm not climbing back in. I could sit on it though. I could hang out
[8471.06s -> 8481.22s]  on it. The side just sunk. Oh, that's what this is for. That's what fell out. That was the very
[8481.22s -> 8495.51s]  loud noise that I heard. I heard an incredibly loud sound. This bed is fucked. I wouldn't, I'd rather
[8495.51s -> 8514.90s]  lie on the dirty one. I'll be honest. What, I got mail? What's the mail? I got a hundred dollars
[8516.55s -> 8525.88s]  from Dolls R Us for the thing I left at the shop. I had a consignment. Well,
[8526.68s -> 8536.76s]  cool. All right, more free money. I'll take free money. Should I go to work too? Send me to work.
[8539.74s -> 8545.83s]  I can't, I, I'm not, I literally, nothing else I'm gonna do out here. I'm not, I'm gonna have to use
[8545.83s -> 8564.50s]  the bathroom too. Feeding, feeding you money so you can make the right decision. I don't think I
[8564.50s -> 8578.15s]  could even put this together if I wanted to. That's the last part of the day. If I hear the
[8578.15s -> 8584.20s]  fire, I'm coming over there. I swear to God. Oh, it's just the bottom. All right. Now I can,
[8584.20s -> 8590.90s]  no, this is a fucking, this is a train wreck under, but wait, this is an air mattress.
[8591.86s -> 8597.98s]  This is not even a bed. Look at what happened under here. What happened under, look at this.
[8598.78s -> 8605.96s]  Do you see what I have to deal with right now? This is, I can't put this together.
[8606.60s -> 8619.22s]  I'm going to sleep on it like that. It's just absolutely destroyed. I don't know if you guys
[8619.22s -> 8623.70s]  can hear it, but it was seriously, it was like, it was like an explosion back here. Like it just
[8623.70s -> 8636.33s]  fell apart in their hands. Work. Oh, is it time for work? I see the car pulling up. Hey, pick up this
[8636.33s -> 8649.59s]  guy. You know what I'm saying? Car. Are they on the road? I don't even hear them. Oh, there you are.
[8649.59s -> 8652.55s]  Don't worry about what you see over here, by the way. Just don't,
[8652.55s -> 8654.71s]  don't drive far enough to see by my driveway.
[8657.43s -> 8693.78s]  Let's go. Yeah, it was a dick move. No, that was a dick move. What you did. Not everybody,
[8693.78s -> 8696.10s]  not everybody thinks that's funny. So I just want to let you know,
[8696.10s -> 8698.10s]  but we'll see you at the party on Saturday. He's still going to go.
[8705.18s -> 8715.13s]  I can't, I got to pee bad. You know, it's funny, even if I wanted to move this,
[8715.13s -> 8722.49s]  I wouldn't be able to. I'm not going through the window. That hurt. Even if I wanted to move this,
[8722.49s -> 8738.94s]  it would be hard for one person. I don't know what to do. I need to get in there.
[8741.69s -> 8789.94s]  What do I do? Help. Hey, excuse me. Excuse me. Help me. Excuse me. Help. Right. There's a water
[8789.94s -> 8797.94s]  fountain over there that I hear. I heard a water fountain. Hey, I wonder if it flushes.
[8807.74s -> 8819.48s]  That's so stupid. Oh, I'm not having a good time though. Give me something to play with. It's so
[8819.48s -> 8828.52s]  much fun. I wouldn't go back in there, but I just don't want to go in the window. Will this fit over
[8828.52s -> 8837.21s]  me? No, I don't think so. I could go like this. No, this is kind of fun what I'm doing, but not
[8837.21s -> 8848.38s]  really. This actually could be a hat, but somebody just said it could be a toilet seat. It's not
[8848.38s -> 8854.04s]  going to be that. I'm not going to use this as a toilet seat. Oh, this is kind of a funny hat.
[8854.04s -> 8866.60s]  This is a funny hat. I like it. This is a funny hat. I can't even block the door. I could very
[8866.60s -> 8884.57s]  easily just get in there. I could, but make food. I can't. Can I eat these flowers edible?
[8885.37s -> 8895.56s]  I don't think I can even. Can I eat one of these? What happens to my hunger level if I eat one of
[8895.56s -> 8912.97s]  these? Hold on. Let me see. Ow. It's like stung me. All right. What if I take like a bite? I'll take
[8912.97s -> 8934.22s]  a big bite. It's not good. I can't go. All right. I'm climbing the window again. No, I don't want to
[8934.22s -> 8949.78s]  climb in the window because then I won't get the comfortable bed. No, I don't want to get hurt.
[8949.78s -> 8958.89s]  This is day one. Oh, shit. But these have been out here for like five days.
[8960.58s -> 8967.74s]  Haven't these been out here for like at least five days, right? Can I actually eat these or is that
[8967.74s -> 8978.23s]  going to be bad for like, what if I just pretend to? I don't know how long these actually have been
[8978.23s -> 8995.27s]  here for. Now I've had another bite. Ooh, that was really good. I want to just like jump in.
[9006.71s -> 9019.50s]  What? What are you doing? You want me to run? Run? Run away. Like now. You want me to run away?
[9023.35s -> 9275.35s]  That, that's like run down the street. I can't get back inside. That's very obvious.
[9275.35s -> 9282.01s]  This is a nice house. How am I going to get back in here? Run away? I've been walking around the
[9282.01s -> 9286.23s]  neighborhood for the last like six hours. You know, people have come out and just looked at
[9286.23s -> 9292.18s]  me and been like, what the hell is this guy doing out here? Seems you have chosen to upgrade the
[9292.18s -> 9302.73s]  house. And what does that mean? That means that that is the end of the tutorial. So thank you for
[9302.73s -> 9307.13s]  playing in our tutorial version of this game. Hopefully it worked out pretty well. I think it
[9307.13s -> 9319.88s]  did. And in two days, that is where the real game starts. So I, this was a ton of fun. Let me look
[9319.88s -> 9324.44s]  at the right camera right here. There we are. I had a ton of fun. Thanks for watching everybody.
[9324.44s -> 9332.52s]  Special huge, huge, huge scam. Well, I want to say thanks everybody for watching. We have two more
[9332.52s -> 9339.24s]  streams of this and it's going to get even more wild. We're literally going to dial it even higher
[9339.24s -> 9344.28s]  and higher every day. So I keep talking to the wrong cameras. I don't know what's wrong with me.
[9345.08s -> 9349.24s]  We're going to dial it up every day. Every single day it's going to get more ridiculous.
[9349.96s -> 9354.28s]  So we want to make sure that everything worked as intended before we got started.
[9354.92s -> 9361.88s]  So I cannot actually get into this house. So I'm not going to even try. Trial version of
[9361.88s -> 9368.36s]  full game unlocked. Special huge thank you to Twitch for partnering with us and to Coinbase.
[9369.54s -> 9374.02s]  Without them, this would never have happened. And there's way more to see over the next two
[9374.02s -> 9379.78s]  or three days. So what that means you'll see in the next few days, but we got everything.
[9380.34s -> 9387.72s]  What was that? You paid to end the stream. You paid to end the tutorial is what you did.
[9389.38s -> 9393.38s]  But yeah, I'm really, really happy. I really think that everything worked out pretty well in
[9393.38s -> 9399.06s]  this kind of tutorial version of the game. So I'm very, very excited. I hope you had fun.
[9399.06s -> 9403.22s]  We got a lot of data. So we got a lot of things that we might have to work on and check out and
[9403.22s -> 9410.87s]  see how they played out. But for the most part, I think it was pretty fun. So we'll see. So we'll
[9410.87s -> 9419.82s]  see with the upgraded house in a couple of days with even more wacky, wild stuff. Thank you,
[9419.82s -> 9425.21s]  everybody. We'll see in a couple of days. Thanks for playing the tutorial. I can't go back in there.
[9426.55s -> 9430.15s]  Huge shout out to Twitch. Huge shout out to Coinbase for letting us do this shit.
[9431.19s -> 9437.53s]  Huge thanks. Without them, it's impossible. We'll see in a couple of days.
