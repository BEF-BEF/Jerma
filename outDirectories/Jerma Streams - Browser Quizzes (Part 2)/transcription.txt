[3305.54s -> 3311.16s]  what the fuck is this song? I've seen, is it resident sleepers because people want me to
[3311.16s -> 3322.82s]  say sleep or because you don't like this? I'm having trouble understanding. Rest all day up
[3322.82s -> 3333.91s]  on the shore. They dream all day up on the shore. They, wait, resident? Why would that be here?

[3426.90s -> 3431.78s]  You dream about going up there, but that is a big mistake. Just look at the world around you right
[3431.78s -> 3438.50s]  here. I don't even know how the tune of this song is. The ocean floor, such wonderful things surround

[3505.74s -> 3510.20s]  another one? Do they have more than these? Oh, let me do the first one. I like this. This is cool.

[3659.96s -> 3672.06s]  where's long from? For, oh no, for a long time. For, uh, wait, what? For the, this, that. Think
[3672.06s -> 3694.79s]  of something else that's not one of those just filler words. People. Um, fish. Egg. Heart. Heart.

[8731.27s -> 8735.19s]  what it's called and i'm sorry if any of you are eating right now but let me just preface this by
[8735.19s -> 8746.09s]  saying i don't know what this is but it's gross there is a substance inside of a lobster and i'm
[8746.09s -> 8751.83s]  telling you right now this is kind of disgusting so mute i'm serious there is this stuff inside of a
[8751.83s -> 8773.26s]  lobster it's this weird like green shit yep it's the green shit i used to watch people eat that
[8773.26s -> 8792.78s]  and i would go what is that and why are you eating it i know that's the best part oh yeah i can't i
[8792.78s -> 8801.86s]  don't i'm sorry but i used to watch spoonfuls of that go into my grandmother's mouth like

[8851.80s -> 8870.71s]  like this and just yeah i can't do it scroll down i like okay claw meat i've i've eaten it i eat it
[8870.71s -> 8880.65s]  i've had it before but i don't know it freaks me out tearing apart an animal and eating its organs
[8880.65s -> 8894.84s]  like a slurpee yes i don't i do not like that i i'm not particularly into that yes how do you
[8894.84s -> 8900.44s]  feel about clams i feel the same way about oysters too like what the fuck man i know oh they're so

[8944.76s -> 8954.74s]  are not gross to me because honestly i don't know what's in i don't know man it's weird to me
[8954.74s -> 8959.14s]  you just like chowder no i will eat clam chowder and i'll be like that was delicious that was very
[8959.14s -> 8967.72s]  good but i don't want to open the clam and drink all of its fluids and its body and inhale it and
[8967.72s -> 8976.42s]  swallow it as fast as i can i don't like to eat my food like taking shots of alcohol i just don't i
[8976.42s -> 8988.54s]  and maybe that makes me a weird guy and i've always oh hey hey hey just put some tabasco on it you'll
[8988.54s -> 8995.14s]  like it you like tabasco you should do it i like tabasco i don't like inhaling a whole animal in
[8995.14s -> 9011.21s]  one second i i don't like breathing in an entire animal and all of its fluids you ever done a raw
[9011.21s -> 9028.86s]  egg shot no you're showing free advertising for oranges what do you mean oranges what are you
[9028.86s -> 9040.50s]  talking about oh wait whatever that is you are a chicken you are a chicken no i'm just very
[9040.50s -> 9055.29s]  particular about food but i only like crab legs and i don't like to eat it that often do a lobster
[9055.29s -> 9060.63s]  review no because i don't want to that one okay why do you not eat lobster because there's only
[9060.63s -> 9068.74s]  one part of a lobster that i like and i'm not going to buy a lobster to just eat its palms
[9069.88s -> 9076.04s]  and not eat the rest of it lobsters number one are expensive and number two i'm not going to i'm not
[9076.04s -> 9085.19s]  going to buy and eat and and and eat this thing to eat 20 of its body i don't want to do that
[9085.19s -> 9095.14s]  when all the rest of it is edible and and you can eat it now if somebody has lobster or crab
[9095.14s -> 9101.78s]  or they're like hey look i've got a lobster would you like a claw serve it up put some
[9101.78s -> 9113.16s]  butter on it what about a whole chicken yeah i don't i mean i i can do that but i don't like
[9113.16s -> 9121.16s]  to do that either now that i think about it i think it's a little different though because
[9121.16s -> 9133.94s]  this thing i this is gonna be bad i know but a lobster no no yeah that's the difference this is
[9133.94s -> 9143.29s]  i it's you're losing followers no i'm not i'm almost at a goddamn million did you see that
[9143.29s -> 9151.06s]  this is 993 000 followers we're close to a million here and when i say we i mean i mean of
[9151.06s -> 9162.26s]  course me lobsters are functionally immortal well that's insane i can't why are we eating an
[9162.26s -> 9177.26s]  immortal being so we're trying to get their knowledge omega l l okay dude how do you feel

[9196.90s -> 9210.41s]  want the internet to work um i like fish but shellfish has just always been a little weird
[9218.60s -> 9226.58s]  big shrimps gonna take you down this was a four out of ten rant this is not a rant this is me
[9226.58s -> 9232.95s]  telling you how i feel about the food is it a rant or is it just me talking about how i eat
[9233.51s -> 9240.09s]  your opinion on greek food i love greek food mediterranean food is literally number one or
[9240.09s -> 9255.18s]  number two i'd say it's up there probably number two uh here's my tier list uh mexican's number one
[9255.18s -> 9262.62s]  after mexican you got mediterranean and italian that are kind of close and then everything else
[9262.62s -> 9273.42s]  what would you order at a greek restaurant um there's lots of things i would order at a greek
[9273.42s -> 9281.34s]  greek restaurant one of my favorite things in the world is just like a chicken shish kebab oh yeah
[9281.34s -> 9293.06s]  it's so good chicken oh my god chicken shawarma that's another one chicken pita pita wraps euros
[9293.06s -> 9307.24s]  oh my goodness with that tzatziki yeah thai food i love thai food a good uh a good pad thai is uh is
[9307.24s -> 9324.54s]  up there too with that peanut sauce forget about it grape leaves a good a good grape leaf see you
[9324.54s -> 9343.72s]  later what about indian food yeah butter chicken oh see ya some of those good curries oh hell yeah
[9343.72s -> 9361.50s]  i like a lot of different foods i just don't like a full like a lobster open it up and drink is the
[9361.50s -> 9376.57s]  the poop in his body i'm sorry i don't want to do that does that make me a little particular why
[9376.57s -> 9382.86s]  you always wait what do you say why do i always what why are you leaving with the food all the
[9382.86s -> 9386.46s]  time usually you can tell the stream is ending when we start talking about food because that
[9386.46s -> 9391.94s]  means i'm hungry because i probably haven't eaten in six to seven hours or so maybe eight hours
[9391.94s -> 9405.38s]  so it's it's time for me to eat that's how you can tell where hot dogs for you they're high but
[9405.38s -> 9410.57s]  they're not that high i'm one of those weird motherfuckers that i will always eat a hot dog
[9410.57s -> 9417.53s]  if it's available every time i don't know why if a hot dog is cooked it's available and it's on a
[9417.53s -> 9425.22s]  tray i will eat it and i mean even if there's other food items oh hey we've got this hey we've
[9425.22s -> 9431.14s]  got chicken salad we got chicken salad and there's also a uh we've got greek salad over here too
[9431.86s -> 9438.20s]  i know you really like um we have some some this quiche and i literally just said that because
[9438.20s -> 9442.41s]  right here and i couldn't think of another food but if there was a hot dog as well oh yeah we've
[9442.41s -> 9450.62s]  got quiche we've got lobster uh we've got hot dogs we've got uh pasta chicken broccoli alfredo
[9450.62s -> 9458.31s]  and hot dogs i'll always get one i will always make room for one hot dog and then i'll eat
[9458.31s -> 9463.38s]  everything eat the hot dog and i'll go up for seconds what do you think i'm getting for seconds
[9463.38s -> 9472.79s]  what am i getting up there for seconds if it's available that's right i will always eat double
[9472.79s -> 9481.94s]  portions of a hot dog barbecue we've got oh yeah we've got some uh cheeseburgers dogs uh maybe some
[9481.94s -> 9486.23s]  fish and grilled fish on the grill i'm always going to eat at least three hot dogs even if i
[9486.23s -> 9504.78s]  eat other stuff is this a quiz no this is the end of the stream what about corn dogs they're okay
[9504.78s -> 9512.06s]  i'd rather have it just a regular dog just one line of mustard on it and that's it nothing else
[9512.06s -> 9523.77s]  just one single line of mustard across nothing else and we're talking just straight up yellow
[9523.77s -> 9540.20s]  just french's mustard nothing fancy nothing fancy loaded chili dog i'll definitely eat it you know
[9540.20s -> 9545.86s]  it's as good uh one line of ketchup and then to make sure it doesn't fall off the hot dog
[9545.86s -> 9553.93s]  take tabasco so you take your toasted bun your hot dog bun open it up and then take tabasco
[9553.93s -> 9559.72s]  and put it inside the bun so it soaks into the bread and then put the hot dog on a drizzle of
[9559.72s -> 9569.90s]  ketchup and that's how that's it it's delicious green peppers on a hot dog i've never done that
[9569.90s -> 9581.48s]  before what's the worst ballpark food popcorn popcorn sucks why would you know popcorn sucks
[9581.48s -> 9592.34s]  i hate popcorn i love popcorn when i make it in my own house and sit on my couch i love it
[9592.34s -> 9604.74s]  popcorn as a going out food is awful it's awful movie theater nope you know what i do here's my
[9604.74s -> 9620.47s]  movie theater mcdonald's order a large coke that's it just a huge at least 32 ounce coca-cola and
[9620.47s -> 9627.96s]  make sure you piss before the movie because popcorn doesn't matter what size you get it always ends
[9627.96s -> 9633.69s]  up the same way you get it you put a bunch of butter all over it and oh wow movie theater
[9633.69s -> 9641.59s]  popcorn let's go your hands end up turning this weird greasy film and it gets all over your lips
[9642.25s -> 9650.12s]  you start to get this popcorn exhaustion where it starts to taste terrible after a while you've got
[9650.12s -> 9655.99s]  half a bag of popcorn that you're not going to eat that you haven't touched and you just it's
[9655.99s -> 9660.39s]  like just butter and oil and it's just like this greasy flavor it's just like i don't fucking want
[9660.39s -> 9668.58s]  to eat this anymore it's like popcorn exhaustion it happens and you end up just getting it stuck
[9668.58s -> 9677.77s]  in every single tooth you know i had a piece of popcorn stuck in the gum up here up underneath
[9677.77s -> 9687.18s]  my front tooth gum and it was there three or four days straight i had to go in there because i it
[9687.18s -> 9694.15s]  was either this or i had to go to the dentist it was slid in the gum so i had to really really
[9694.15s -> 9701.32s]  meticulously with a fingernail sit there for it but it felt probably like at least an hour just
[9701.32s -> 9709.53s]  get it get it get it no no it's still in there finding various tools and then finally like you
[9709.53s -> 9724.90s]  slide it down out of the gum it sucked now even with a toothpick it was hard i like popcorn it's
[9724.90s -> 9733.10s]  just i don't like eating it at um out at places because you always have that you always don't even
[9733.10s -> 9744.34s]  eat it it can really get bad that you have to go to the dentist and i contemplated it at least once
[9744.34s -> 9749.80s]  you know what i was talking to holly about uh the other day which she was she looked at me she was
[9749.80s -> 9755.06s]  like what happened to you what happened this is completely unrelated but i want to talk about it
