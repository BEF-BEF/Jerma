[1.40s -> 8.10s]  Hey, what's happening? So uh, I gotta do something real quick. I promised I was gonna do this.
[8.10s -> 11.62s]  Just make sure that I'm ready to go and I'm gonna do a backflip right now.
[12.58s -> 22.25s]  Here comes backflip. That was a pretty good landing. I stuck it completely. I'll do uh,
[22.25s -> 32.36s]  do two in a row. Do two in a row. Okay, okay, I'll try. Damn. All right. I kind of hurt my
[32.36s -> 45.85s]  back a little bit doing that. I'm all right. Anyways, hi. How are you? Well, the Kinect,
[46.89s -> 55.69s]  Kinect crap. Welcome to the fucking Kinect crap day two. My name is GermanN85. How are you doing?
[60.23s -> 68.78s]  Today, we're gonna do some extra, and not extras, we're gonna do some extra. We've got
[69.58s -> 75.90s]  Kinect Star Wars. That's gonna be a popular one. I can already tell. We've got Into the Nightmare,
[75.90s -> 85.05s]  whatever this horror movie is. We've got Harry Potter, episodes five, six, and seven.
[87.06s -> 95.08s]  We've got, what else do we got? Oh, I'm not even gonna say the name of that one or it'll give it
[95.08s -> 109.14s]  away. Gotta get that out. I did three, I did four backflips in a row, so I had to kind of get that
[109.14s -> 117.91s]  out of my system. We're gonna start with Kinect Star Wars. By the way, I want to make sure you
[117.91s -> 123.75s]  understand this because I need to say it a few times. I know what's in this game, and this will
[123.75s -> 134.31s]  be the only time ever, and I really mean this, ever, that you're going to see me dance on this
[134.31s -> 145.21s]  string. Ever. We're gonna do one song, I think, and I know it's the one you go like this. And,
[145.85s -> 153.99s]  oh fuck, not ready. Not ready. Hold on. Not ready. Not ready. Not ready. Not ready. I forgot about
[153.99s -> 162.07s]  my wireless Bluetooth setup. Hold on, not ready. Not ready. My wireless, like, Bluetooth setup. I
[162.07s -> 167.82s]  didn't put it, I didn't set it up. God damn it, I had to charge it. It shouldn't take too long.
[168.54s -> 173.54s]  How could I forget about my fucking wireless capabilities? All right, this is good. That's
[173.54s -> 181.88s]  it. Where's the, okay, there's the right. Just gotta sync it, and I'm ready to go. Hold on.
[182.52s -> 197.32s]  God damn it, my god, this is stupid. All right, syncing now. Here we go. Battery fully charged.
[197.32s -> 207.38s]  I just got confirmation. Sync up. Do it. Sync up, please. Come on. Don't make me look like a fool.
[214.02s -> 224.68s]  Number one. Bluetooth pairing successful. Bluetooth connected. Oh yeah. Yeah, don't
[224.68s -> 232.63s]  even tell me. I don't know. Fuck, I don't know. See that image? All right, I gotta test it. I gotta
[232.63s -> 244.42s]  test it. Hold on. Let's go over here. Just like tie in a tie. On the neck, under, and then over.
[246.07s -> 251.26s]  Make it a little looser. All right, I got my tie on. Wait, that's not good.
[252.06s -> 257.78s]  How did I do this last time? How did I do this last time? Did anybody see me do it?
[258.50s -> 262.34s]  Did anybody actually see me do this last time? No, you didn't. All right, I'm ready. Here we go.
[263.30s -> 271.26s]  Through the loop. Tighten it. There we go. Through the loop again. Into the shirt. That's what it was.
[272.06s -> 282.39s]  All right, I'm good. All right. All right. Synced up. Here we go. It's time to play Star Wars.
[282.95s -> 290.01s]  The Kinect version. Why did they just spit the disc out at me? Why? What's, what are you talking
[290.01s -> 302.55s]  about? They just like spit it back up. Okay, I think we're good. Welcome everybody to Kinect.
[302.55s -> 334.20s]  Crap, my pants too. I got water this time. I probably should turn it down. It might be a
[334.20s -> 339.82s]  little too loud. Just a little bit. That's better. So remember, this is Kinect. If you don't know
[339.82s -> 345.74s]  what the Kinect is, it is a terminal reality. It's a virtual reality simulation system.
[346.94s -> 356.87s]  How do I skip all this? This game auto saves automatically. Please do not turn off your
[356.87s -> 368.44s]  console when you see this symbol. Do be careful. Well, auto. We're most insistent that we not
[368.44s -> 376.62s]  disturb anything. I walked into Star Wars. This is a very important assignment. I honestly couldn't
[376.78s -> 384.30s]  Oh, auto. Oh, hello. I am C3PO, human cyborg relations. Auto. Master Luke said we would
[384.30s -> 391.42s]  meet you here. We're most excited to have you supervise our mission. Very good. Uh, start game.
[393.99s -> 403.46s]  Start game. Start game. I said the microphone symbol's down there. I'm supposed to assume
[403.46s -> 409.35s]  it's not going to work. It's like continue to play using this profile or sign in to choose a
[409.35s -> 418.36s]  different one. This game uses drop in drop. Yeah, it's 10 to Dragoon 74. It's me. Yes, we're running.
[418.36s -> 421.88s]  This is going to start to get low here over the next few Kinect streams, I think.
[422.84s -> 427.00s]  And yes, I've got the thing in the hair. Make sure it doesn't get in my face today.
[429.40s -> 433.32s]  Of course, I qualified R2. How else do you think we got this assignment?
[433.32s -> 435.32s]  R2.
[452.50s -> 465.69s]  Jedi Destiny Dark Side Rising. We've also got Podracing? Podracing? Galactic Dance-off.
[465.93s -> 469.13s]  Translating all these files into Shrevewook? We'd be here for centuries.
[469.13s -> 475.59s]  Rancor Rampage? When am I going to use my lightsaber? Duel of Fates. I can't use my
[475.59s -> 481.99s]  lightsaber yet. I'm not doing the dance-off first. Absolutely not. Okay, what about Jedi Destiny?
[481.99s -> 487.19s]  The history of an entire species. Jedi Destiny Dark Side Rising. Let's do this one.
[489.14s -> 492.18s]  If I'm interpreting this correctly, I want to use the lightsaber.
[492.18s -> 501.46s]  I'm not doing the dance-off first. That's like the pinnacle of all online content.
[502.42s -> 509.54s]  I think I'm going to do that first. It's the only time I'm ever going to get this dance-off
[509.54s -> 517.88s]  straight. Like the best thing that I will ever do on this channel. Like the most highly rated
[517.88s -> 525.66s]  thing that I will ever fucking do. Here we go. Get away. Excellent. Now call up the file, R2.
[525.66s -> 534.66s]  Let's take a better look at the commander selection. Begin the destiny. Am I the Jedi
[534.66s -> 545.74s]  in Star Wars Connect? No. I have to pick from a random Jedi? The Jedi history really is quite
[545.74s -> 552.14s]  stirring. Honestly, my compassion algorithms have never seen so much use. I can't be like Darth Me?
[552.14s -> 562.90s]  I don't know why I want to play it. I think I'm going to be the alien over here.
[562.90s -> 568.66s]  By my calculations, there is a 63.44% chance that any of these operations will end in failure.
[568.66s -> 582.54s]  When dealer is showing a six, I know C-3PO. What's good about the singe? Casual or advanced.
[583.10s -> 586.30s]  That was a fucking funny joke because that actually is the percentage. It's like 63.4%.
[587.18s -> 590.30s]  I swear to God, that's a funny joke. I don't care if anybody thinks it's funny.
[591.26s -> 594.78s]  The record begins with Master Zane and her padawans approaching the planet.
[597.02s -> 607.14s]  The training never stops. What are you doing? I want to select my padawan? That's me, right?
[607.94s -> 621.16s]  Okay, Darth Singe. Oh, it's flip two. Whatever. Let's go. What did I do?
[621.88s -> 627.14s]  Let's see if I can get a good spot with the sun beams right into my fucking eyes.
[628.10s -> 643.14s]  I'll get it. Star Wars. Right. Oh, he's singing. That means he has to go like this.
[644.02s -> 655.32s]  All right. How do I make it go faster? Go faster. It is a time of uncertainty.
[657.74s -> 663.02s]  It is a time of uncertainty alarmed by the encounter with the Sith Lord Darth Maul
[663.02s -> 668.06s]  on Naboo. The Jedi Council has begun strengthening the ranks of the Jedi Order.
[668.78s -> 673.34s]  By opening training outposts to instruct a new generation of padawan learners.
[674.30s -> 679.67s]  Meanwhile, events throughout the galaxy suggest that the influence of the dark side is spreading.
[680.79s -> 689.14s]  A group of padawans are on their way to Kashyyyk, home world of the Wookiees, to learn about the
[689.14s -> 695.00s]  force in preparation for the difficult times ahead. The narrator doesn't know how to...
[695.00s -> 704.63s]  All right, let's go. Is that synced up? You should hear the snap of my handcuffs
[704.63s -> 712.02s]  up there like that. Bored. Let's go.
[730.63s -> 738.23s]  It's a new guy. It's a new guy. Welcome, padawans. Each one of you is strong in the force. Brave.
[738.87s -> 747.37s]  Instructed in the teachings of our order. But not all of you will become Jedi. As you know,
[747.93s -> 755.98s]  the ones must proceed through a series of trials. Trials of skill, courage, insight.
[756.94s -> 758.46s]  I'm roleplaying. Stop.
[762.62s -> 764.30s]  Stop. You're gonna blow this for me. Stop.
[765.10s -> 769.77s]  Blow it for me. I'm gonna pick my lightsaber now.
[772.74s -> 773.54s]  No, that's not me.
[783.35s -> 785.19s]  I think this is cutting off circulation of my brain.
[788.57s -> 789.05s]  It is me.
[791.61s -> 792.11s]  You got it.
[793.85s -> 806.49s]  Feel the force flow between you and the pedestal. Take a moment to feel its weight.
[807.77s -> 816.49s]  Oh, shit. He's insane. Let's start with some simple drills. Swing back and forth until you
[816.49s -> 820.81s]  feel comfortable. Shouldn't we step back from each other? You're too... I think you're too close.
[820.81s -> 823.05s]  We're gonna clan. Some of the ancient Jedi forms.
[823.77s -> 831.13s]  You've been practicing these since you were younglings. Very good, padawan.
[833.69s -> 844.17s]  Should I clang him? Just ding. Does this block? Oh, I was doing that.
[848.17s -> 855.62s]  I didn't get to customize my character. All right, that's a really dangerous move
[855.62s -> 858.34s]  because if you fuck that up, that goes through your back and kills you.
[859.22s -> 862.02s]  Like, even if you're slightly off, I mean, it looks real cool.
[862.58s -> 864.82s]  But that literally goes through the back of your skull when you die.
[865.30s -> 874.49s]  Oh, yeah? I mean, that was kind of cool teach. Check this out.
[875.93s -> 876.73s]  Dad, I win.
[885.50s -> 890.62s]  Can I two-hand? I'm a two-handed sword kind of guy.
[891.34s -> 899.46s]  As Master Yoda can attest, we live in an uncivilized time.
[900.34s -> 903.14s]  In combat, many of your opponents will use blasters.
[903.86s -> 908.34s]  If you can't get close enough to strike your enemy, you'll need to deflect their blaster bolts.
[909.14s -> 911.78s]  So you just gotta go, bing. Now it's your turn.
[912.82s -> 919.45s]  Audio is decent. I don't care. Some enemies will attack from a distance.
[919.45s -> 922.65s]  Use your lightsaber for deflection. I'm not doing this shit like yesterday.
[923.53s -> 934.81s]  Very good. One guy's not going to turn the stream off for like 30 minutes to get beat up.
[934.81s -> 938.17s]  I know it's safe. I checked it. It's not perfect, but it never will be.
[969.93s -> 971.53s]  Oh, let's do it.
[971.53s -> 974.01s]  Padawan, you must deflect these laser blasts.
[974.01s -> 974.97s]  No Padawan is perfect.
[974.97s -> 976.09s]  I've done it four times.
[976.09s -> 977.85s]  No Jedi Knight either, for that matter.
[981.59s -> 982.15s]  Good work.
[983.19s -> 984.47s]  I'm sorry, I gotta D.
[986.68s -> 987.32s]  I gotta D.
[987.32s -> 991.40s]  There will be times when your opponent won't simply vaporize or be sliced into pieces.
[992.12s -> 993.96s]  Sometimes you will have a true duel.
[994.84s -> 996.52s]  You two, come forward.
[998.36s -> 1002.12s]  Let's move on. You'll need some space for this, so spread out.
[1002.12s -> 1005.80s]  Of course, these are all training sabers, so no one will lose an arm today.
[1005.80s -> 1006.84s]  I want to do the thing that you did.
[1006.84s -> 1009.88s]  And it will cost quite a wealth, though. Wouldn't be very instructive.
[1009.88s -> 1011.64s]  I can't do it from behind the back?
[1011.64s -> 1014.92s]  Engage your opponents. Attempt to block their lightsaber strikes.
[1015.48s -> 1019.88s]  Left, right, high, low. Pay close attention to the enemy's attacks.
[1025.45s -> 1028.25s]  Move your saber to the correct position, Padawan.
[1028.25s -> 1037.85s]  I just what? Okay. I thought I just got my head.
[1039.85s -> 1044.81s]  You can do better to defend yourself. Also, a quick dodge or jump at the right moment
[1044.81s -> 1046.49s]  allows you to avoid. Why am I dodging?
[1046.49s -> 1048.97s]  I shouldn't be dodging. Defend yourself against your enemy,
[1048.97s -> 1052.17s]  you have the opportunity to change the momentum of the fight.
[1052.73s -> 1055.61s]  To put it on your terms. Why am I dodging?
[1056.57s -> 1067.00s]  I shouldn't be dodging. Why is it blocked to dodge?
[1067.72s -> 1081.74s]  Once you now have your opening to train and try to defeat your opponent in a duel.
[1101.29s -> 1106.39s]  I'm going to clash.
[1111.16s -> 1113.08s]  Do I have to hold it? Do I have to kick him? Okay.
[1114.44s -> 1135.96s]  There we go. There we go.
[1136.60s -> 1142.01s]  Please, whoa, don't do a finishing move. Is that it?
[1142.01s -> 1142.65s]  Well done.
[1145.34s -> 1145.98s]  Fatality.
[1146.62s -> 1150.87s]  A good beginning, Padawan, but there'll be much more to learn on Kashyyyk.
[1151.75s -> 1153.78s]  Prepare for arrival.
[1154.58s -> 1159.16s]  And now it's time for your next Jedi technique.
[1159.88s -> 1161.16s]  The fucking dancing.
[1168.79s -> 1170.07s]  All right, this is gonna be real.
[1185.10s -> 1185.74s]  All right, let's go.
[1186.54s -> 1196.34s]  I think you're ready to block. Block, block.
[1197.46s -> 1200.15s]  Slash. Should I skip the cinematic?
[1200.15s -> 1201.43s]  Does anybody care about Star Wars?
[1202.74s -> 1205.38s]  No, nobody cares about the story in Star Wars.
[1205.38s -> 1207.78s]  They just care about the light thing that makes cool sounds.
[1208.66s -> 1209.86s]  Master Windu was here too.
[1209.86s -> 1214.02s]  I can't believe it. It's Obi-Wan kind of Sith boy.
[1214.02s -> 1224.71s]  Danger? Great hope in you. We have.
[1226.79s -> 1228.31s]  Tomorrow, your lessons begin.
[1243.42s -> 1245.10s]  Here are your new trainees, Master Yoda.
[1245.74s -> 1249.02s]  I'll warn you, they're still very rough, but they do have potential.
[1250.22s -> 1253.50s]  Say the same for you. We once did, long ago.
[1253.50s -> 1257.21s]  No Padawan could ask for a better master than you.
[1258.41s -> 1261.77s]  A pleasure you were.
[1261.77s -> 1264.66s]  You've done very well, Ma'am. A council sanction.
[1265.30s -> 1267.70s]  We know you understand the importance of this undertaking.
[1268.34s -> 1269.06s]  My turn yet?
[1269.06s -> 1270.58s]  There's something troubling you, Master Yoda.
[1272.39s -> 1275.43s]  Something dark I see in these Padawans' future.
[1275.43s -> 1280.62s]  We have all sensed it, and yet the council's vision remains clouded.
[1281.50s -> 1285.90s]  The events on Naboo, Darth Maul's appearance, these were no aberrations.
[1285.90s -> 1292.26s]  There is a darkness rising in the galaxy, and the Sith Master waits in the shadows.
[1293.62s -> 1298.57s]  I must return now to Coruscant. May the Force be with you.
[1305.82s -> 1307.98s]  No, they did it to wipe the source Lucas, right?
[1308.70s -> 1325.72s]  Your training does.
[1325.72s -> 1327.64s]  Why is this Wipeout Wookiee edition?
[1331.38s -> 1333.30s]  Wait, hold on, do I have to do this?
[1335.42s -> 1336.54s]  I don't think I'm going to be able to do this.
[1339.37s -> 1342.17s]  I'm standing here, I'm standing right here.
[1343.45s -> 1345.69s]  Okay, I have to do Wipeout Wookiee challenge.
[1346.97s -> 1359.70s]  Focus, focus into your center, then explode outward with a kick.
[1359.70s -> 1371.21s]  And wipe out man.
[1372.01s -> 1386.18s]  Source senses, avoid these obstacles quickly. Explode quickly to avoid the logs.
[1386.18s -> 1392.34s]  Time has come that this is only a test.
[1407.78s -> 1409.38s]  Go! What the fuck are you doing?
[1423.19s -> 1424.23s]  I hate this.
[1425.27s -> 1453.75s]  What? Am I out of like, Naruto powers?
[1454.39s -> 1461.03s]  For most of the end we are.
[1461.75s -> 1464.71s]  Help you, I could, but then you would not learn.
[1464.71s -> 1465.67s]  Why can't I just walk?
[1465.67s -> 1476.36s]  Use your senses to jump at the right time.
[1476.36s -> 1477.48s]  Once more, Padawan.
[1477.48s -> 1478.12s]  I don't know.
[1480.26s -> 1489.24s]  I jumped through it.
[1499.88s -> 1500.60s]  I just want to walk.
[1501.40s -> 1504.97s]  He's laughing at you?
[1516.74s -> 1518.98s]  Use the force to knock over the training dummy.
[1519.54s -> 1534.71s]  What? Wrong arm.
[1534.71s -> 1537.03s]  Concentrate, focus.
[1537.03s -> 1538.23s]  Do not be afraid.
[1538.23s -> 1542.74s]  You have the most serious mind.
[1542.74s -> 1544.63s]  Guide you, these will.
[1546.04s -> 1547.40s]  I'm itching my leg.
[1548.60s -> 1549.88s]  He's like, putting his hand.
[1550.84s -> 1552.28s]  I can't like, itch my leg.
[1555.08s -> 1556.44s]  Oh, get in there! It's like, come on!
[1557.00s -> 1559.14s]  And heavy objects will live.
[1559.14s -> 1559.64s]  Oh.
[1574.81s -> 1580.70s]  Yeah, test your skill.
[1580.70s -> 1581.20s]  This will.
[1581.98s -> 1582.48s]  Yes.
[1582.86s -> 1586.78s]  This is just Jillian Michaels in the jungle workout for James.
[1586.78s -> 1588.38s]  Cannot withstand the power of the force.
[1588.38s -> 1589.82s]  Now we have to play Angry Birds.
[1589.82s -> 1591.90s]  Use the force to select the rocks.
[1591.90s -> 1615.24s]  And at the tower, fling them.
[1615.24s -> 1615.74s]  Not bad.
[1616.60s -> 1617.64s]  Very good.
[1617.64s -> 1620.18s]  First hit, first try.
[1620.18s -> 1623.37s]  With a simple rock, an explosive.
[1623.37s -> 1630.86s]  You manipulate it by holding your hand out and focus your energy on the rock.
[1631.02s -> 1634.36s]  To catch it, catch with you can.
[1634.36s -> 1635.40s]  And redirect it.
[1635.40s -> 1635.90s]  Yes.
[1635.90s -> 1637.08s]  What? Catch it? Oh, catch the rock.
[1640.06s -> 1648.46s]  Am I trying to hit you on the head?
[1649.18s -> 1650.62s]  Imitation.
[1650.62s -> 1659.29s]  Precision to your display.
[1659.29s -> 1659.79s]  Okay.
[1659.79s -> 1660.57s]  No more training.
[1660.57s -> 1661.07s]  Not bad.
[1661.61s -> 1662.65s]  I don't even need any more training.
[1662.65s -> 1664.73s]  I know you. That what you need.
[1664.73s -> 1666.76s]  I gotta stop walking forward.
[1666.76s -> 1668.44s]  I'm just like, wandering around like an idiot.
[1669.64s -> 1686.36s]  Uh-oh, here we go.
[1687.48s -> 1688.84s]  Here comes the lip.
[1691.37s -> 1692.57s]  Senate Scythe.
[1694.28s -> 1695.80s]  That's it, if you've never seen Star Wars before.
[1697.93s -> 1698.43s]  Don't.
[1700.66s -> 1702.50s]  It's literally like, it's just too much.
[1703.14s -> 1709.58s]  That was it.
[1710.44s -> 1711.40s]  I took out the whole thing.
[1718.79s -> 1720.79s]  Yeah, Star Wars, it's a whole thing.
[1720.79s -> 1722.47s]  This is like 30, 40 books.
[1723.11s -> 1729.13s]  I love to say, oh, but the Star Wars movies now, it's based on like 50 novels.
[1729.13s -> 1730.89s]  And they're all like a thousand pages long.
[1730.89s -> 1731.77s]  It's just, it's a lot.
[1733.37s -> 1735.85s]  The books, you know, they're all right.
[1735.85s -> 1738.09s]  But if you really want to get the whole thing, you gotta read them all.
[1744.15s -> 1747.19s]  The movies really condense everything down way too much.
[1748.39s -> 1755.64s]  I think the first, so episode four, which is Star Wars, it was for a lost city.
[1756.36s -> 1759.24s]  It's like, I think this, it's like the middle 30 books.
[1759.24s -> 1761.64s]  Like, there's like 20, book 20 to book 35.
[1762.84s -> 1765.48s]  You can really start the books out of one or two, which everyone was like, what the fuck is this?
[1768.26s -> 1771.46s]  Like, it was episode, book 20 came out in 1970 or something.
[1772.18s -> 1779.43s]  You see how much that doesn't make any sense when you talk about other pieces of media?
[1779.43s -> 1779.83s]  George.
[1799.59s -> 1800.71s]  This thing's gonna explode.
[1802.87s -> 1803.83s]  Oh, I thought we were gonna do it.
[1803.83s -> 1806.81s]  I thought we were just gonna blow up.
[1806.81s -> 1808.01s]  Is this gonna kill us both?
[1808.73s -> 1822.94s]  Quick, Yoda, bail.
[1823.66s -> 1824.86s]  Bail out Yoda.
[1824.86s -> 1826.14s]  Go find us a motorcycle.
[1838.78s -> 1843.10s]  Actually, the control's pretty good.
[1846.30s -> 1846.94s]  How do you break?
[1848.62s -> 1859.98s]  Thank God there's a shield.
[1859.98s -> 1861.58s]  Otherwise, a regenerating shield.
[1862.14s -> 1864.38s]  Otherwise, Yoda, we would be in some shit right now.
[1866.22s -> 1877.22s]  Break out.
[1877.22s -> 1878.86s]  Not bad.
[1879.64s -> 1880.60s]  No, there's more.
[1881.24s -> 1881.80s]  This is boss.
[1882.84s -> 1883.32s]  Boss ship.
[1884.52s -> 1893.14s]  Is it telegraphing on the ground?
[1893.70s -> 1894.98s]  It makes this a lot easier, I guess.
[1896.42s -> 1904.68s]  Don't, thank God.
[1906.23s -> 1910.07s]  Oh, I did advanced difficulty too, didn't I?
[1917.13s -> 1918.89s]  Now you finally said something.
[1922.92s -> 1924.36s]  Look at the trees.
[1925.24s -> 1926.20s]  Oh, sorry, Yoda.
[1926.20s -> 1927.64s]  I thought that I was gonna drive into them.
[1932.81s -> 1933.31s]  Shit.
[1934.73s -> 1935.45s]  Am I going the right way?
[1936.33s -> 1946.68s]  Stop talking in front of me.
[1946.68s -> 1947.40s]  I don't care about the...
[1950.38s -> 1950.88s]  Break.
[1966.54s -> 1968.38s]  All right, so Yoda's gonna jump off and slash him?
[1970.38s -> 1971.82s]  Oh, we just got to get that last little scene.
[1971.82s -> 1972.46s]  That's pretty cool.
[1984.04s -> 1984.84s]  Break the disk?
[1985.48s -> 1992.31s]  I'm not gonna shred every Kinect disk.
[1992.95s -> 1997.46s]  Cross the water to the village.
[2022.12s -> 2023.77s]  We'll shoot them.
[2024.57s -> 2026.01s]  If I'm gonna break, you need to shoot.
[2026.65s -> 2035.74s]  All right, I was supposed to go that way.
[2036.54s -> 2043.85s]  There's a big wave bracer.
[2044.57s -> 2045.88s]  It reminds me of it.
[2058.90s -> 2061.54s]  All right, I'm done with the bracing around shooting.
[2062.42s -> 2064.30s]  Can we do anything else, Yoda?
[2068.57s -> 2074.81s]  I can't see.
[2076.12s -> 2076.76s]  This is a blur.
[2076.76s -> 2077.24s]  It's blur.
[2077.24s -> 2077.80s]  It's a blur.
[2077.80s -> 2078.84s]  I swear to God, it's a blur.
[2079.56s -> 2082.87s]  That was all the same thing we were saying.
[2082.87s -> 2092.30s]  What the fuck?
[2111.80s -> 2112.30s]  Can I break?
[2119.45s -> 2123.51s]  No, fuck.
[2123.51s -> 2125.35s]  Thank God this saves states.
[2125.35s -> 2126.87s]  10 seconds to shoot.
[2126.87s -> 2129.08s]  Let's do it.
[2129.08s -> 2144.82s]  Just like that?
[2144.82s -> 2145.78s]  Good job, Yoda.
[2146.58s -> 2147.94s]  We make a great team.
[2147.94s -> 2149.22s]  They should make a movie about us.
[2150.34s -> 2151.30s]  Don't worry, they will.
[2153.62s -> 2155.54s]  At last, the village we have reached.
[2159.93s -> 2160.43s]  They will.
[2161.13s -> 2167.03s]  That wasn't very fun.
[2167.91s -> 2169.03s]  I don't think that was very fun at all.
[2177.99s -> 2179.83s]  I like the Jedi stuff.
[2180.79s -> 2183.74s]  I think I know why the Kinect failed.
[2184.46s -> 2190.86s]  Because 75% of every single Kinect game is dodge left or dodge right.
[2191.42s -> 2193.26s]  That's if they didn't do anything else.
[2193.98s -> 2198.60s]  Go like this or go like that.
[2199.40s -> 2202.22s]  That's almost every single one of these.
[2202.22s -> 2207.26s]  And sometimes you go like this.
[2208.38s -> 2217.32s]  I'm here, right?
[2217.32s -> 2221.62s]  You're training.
[2221.62s -> 2223.14s]  And may the force be with you.
[2224.34s -> 2230.81s]  All right, this is what I wanted to do.
[2231.61s -> 2244.50s]  I feel like I played Harry Potter the exact same way.
[2246.22s -> 2247.50s]  This is deflecting.
[2249.54s -> 2250.26s]  All right, now go in.
[2251.14s -> 2258.76s]  You missed one on your right.
[2259.48s -> 2265.08s]  Get over here.
[2265.08s -> 2266.14s]  Come here.
[2266.14s -> 2270.41s]  I had a chance.
[2271.21s -> 2271.69s]  Didn't work.
[2285.14s -> 2285.78s]  All involved.
[2285.78s -> 2286.50s]  All of your friends.
[2287.30s -> 2291.59s]  I want to do an actual deflect like that.
[2292.71s -> 2294.17s]  Like that.
[2294.17s -> 2294.81s]  That was fun.
[2294.81s -> 2295.53s]  That was pretty fun.
[2296.17s -> 2306.49s]  It's on rails.
[2307.37s -> 2318.06s]  I can do that too.
[2318.86s -> 2321.72s]  Wait, no, no, no, no, no.
[2321.72s -> 2322.52s]  I can actually play.
[2323.56s -> 2340.66s]  This way?
[2340.66s -> 2341.16s]  Down?
[2341.62s -> 2355.94s]  This is kind of a pathetic Jedi.
[2355.94s -> 2358.74s]  If you can't take one droid with a stick,
[2359.78s -> 2361.22s]  you probably need to go back to school.
[2373.24s -> 2380.79s]  All right, those guys have armor.
[2381.35s -> 2383.13s]  I'll handle this.
[2383.85s -> 2399.77s]  He's coming in.
[2403.40s -> 2404.68s]  That arm looks like it's going to explode.
[2411.08s -> 2411.48s]  Not bad.
[2411.48s -> 2412.84s]  That was like, just let me walk through.
[2412.84s -> 2414.36s]  Like, did you really have to have that?
[2414.36s -> 2414.86s]  Yeah.
[2416.76s -> 2418.97s]  Here comes boss, I think.
[2419.77s -> 2435.77s]  Oh, Chewbacca.
[2435.77s -> 2437.37s]  Chewbacca is dead.
[2438.58s -> 2439.54s]  Oh, shit.
[2440.18s -> 2441.30s]  Chewie.
[2441.30s -> 2441.80s]  No.
[2443.78s -> 2459.10s]  He got shot like right in the head.
[2459.10s -> 2460.22s]  Oh, that was terrible.
[2465.74s -> 2466.94s]  That was awful.
[2467.98s -> 2468.86s]  That's not canon.
[2469.90s -> 2471.66s]  This is one of these expanded universes.
[2478.84s -> 2481.40s]  It's like somebody just, like, knocked him up.
[2482.68s -> 2483.80s]  Go on, get in there, Chewie.
[2509.30s -> 2510.42s]  They're all, they're, all right.
[2510.42s -> 2511.46s]  It's by their own movies.
[2512.74s -> 2520.41s]  How did you figure eight?
[2521.64s -> 2522.20s]  Figure eight.
[2523.54s -> 2524.18s]  Figure eight.
[2524.98s -> 2528.23s]  I, I, my brain can't do it when I hear this sound.
[2567.94s -> 2568.90s]  I didn't do anything.
[2568.90s -> 2571.54s]  I just stood behind and just, I just looked like I was doing something.
[2573.54s -> 2576.38s]  We were all carrying the sofa, like six of us,
[2576.38s -> 2578.30s]  and I was just putting my fingertips on him, attending.
[2579.26s -> 2580.74s]  Where's my lightsaber?
[2581.38s -> 2584.54s]  Oh, right.
[2590.97s -> 2592.09s]  He's all right.
[2592.09s -> 2593.37s]  He's all right.
[2593.37s -> 2593.93s]  He's okay.
[2595.53s -> 2599.99s]  He's gonna be fine.
[2608.18s -> 2609.30s]  I actually have to do this.
[2609.30s -> 2610.34s]  That's actually part of what I have to do.
[2616.98s -> 2619.46s]  No, I'm gonna get an ice cream, mom.
[2627.16s -> 2653.35s]  This is how actors look, right?
[2653.35s -> 2655.19s]  This is, all right, I just, like, kill skull.
[2659.05s -> 2661.05s]  The actors just do this shit in front of a green screen.
[2661.05s -> 2663.05s]  They just, in action, and they just go like this.
[2666.34s -> 2669.06s]  And then, like, six million dollars worth of CG.
[2669.70s -> 2672.58s]  And editing goes into that and makes it look, it makes it look awesome.
[2674.82s -> 2676.66s]  Go look at any behind the scenes for the many movies
[2676.66s -> 2678.26s]  you've ever seen in your whole life that had action in it.
[2678.26s -> 2678.74s]  It's like this.
[2684.86s -> 2686.30s]  It's, it doesn't even look real.
[2686.30s -> 2689.10s]  Like, then all the millions of dollars that make it, like,
[2689.10s -> 2691.10s]  fuck, fly everywhere, it's ridiculous.
[2691.10s -> 2691.58s]  What do I do?
[2702.28s -> 2711.19s]  Now what?
[2711.19s -> 2715.21s]  Oh, John just barely made it.
[2715.77s -> 2717.66s]  Did I get it?
[2721.24s -> 2722.12s]  John, look it.
[2722.12s -> 2724.44s]  Look at the actor and look at, look at the action, right?
[2724.44s -> 2724.94s]  I told you.
[2755.91s -> 2757.75s]  She just, she just killed, like, five people on our team.
[2758.63s -> 2759.19s]  Just saying.
[2772.78s -> 2776.28s]  I think I missed my opportunity.
[2776.28s -> 2778.12s]  I think I missed the opportunity.
[2778.12s -> 2779.40s]  Why am I jogging?
[2799.48s -> 2800.52s]  Big rates, big rates.
[2800.52s -> 2801.72s]  I gotta, I gotta stop thinking about it.
[2801.72s -> 2802.92s]  I fuck it up every time I think about it.
[2828.09s -> 2828.73s]  Let me get one.
[2831.13s -> 2832.17s]  That was on her.
[2832.17s -> 2833.13s]  That wasn't even on me.
[2833.13s -> 2833.77s]  That was on her.
[2835.85s -> 2836.81s]  She missed that one.
[2848.31s -> 2849.59s]  I just saved your life.
[2851.02s -> 2851.52s]  Turn around.
[2852.89s -> 2853.85s]  Are you fucking serious?
[2863.50s -> 2865.98s]  I need to get inside the ship to destroy the core.
[2865.98s -> 2867.74s]  Hold them off as long as you can.
[2867.74s -> 2869.69s]  I'm gonna accept the thermal detonator.
[2874.94s -> 2876.46s]  I can't wait till the fucking music goes.
[2877.18s -> 2907.78s]  How the fuck do I go over there?
[2932.34s -> 2932.84s]  Yeah.
[2955.99s -> 2958.23s]  Hey, that's low.
[2959.03s -> 2969.14s]  They didn't do anything.
[2983.72s -> 2991.16s]  Whew.
[2991.16s -> 2992.04s]  Why flip?
[2992.04s -> 2993.24s]  Why not just leap?
[2993.24s -> 2995.72s]  Why not, like, step over and land safely?
[2995.72s -> 2996.76s]  Why flip?
[2996.76s -> 2998.20s]  You can't see where the fuck you're landing.
[3003.13s -> 3010.26s]  Imagine trusting the fact that you're gonna do a full rotation and land on your feet.
[3011.30s -> 3013.21s]  You just don't.
[3013.21s -> 3015.94s]  You just miscalculate when you're going forward.
[3015.94s -> 3017.06s]  You just land on your back.
[3017.78s -> 3021.99s]  That's when, like, baseball players, like, do something stupid
[3021.99s -> 3023.67s]  and they end up on the, I mean, like, the disabled list
[3023.67s -> 3024.95s]  for, like, 15, 30 days.
[3024.95s -> 3026.87s]  That's the type of shit that you do when you're a Jedi.
[3026.87s -> 3027.99s]  You end up on the fucking DL.
[3031.83s -> 3032.33s]  Yeah.
[3039.18s -> 3040.54s]  They have to have a list, guys.
[3040.54s -> 3041.04s]  Really?
[3060.87s -> 3062.71s]  I can't wait till we transition to dancing.
[3063.67s -> 3075.88s]  I was gonna do a Chewie, but it might have been a really, really embarrassing Chewie.
[3075.88s -> 3077.24s]  Let's get started then.
[3077.24s -> 3078.28s]  Let me test it behind you.
[3078.28s -> 3079.32s]  Let me just test it and see.
[3083.32s -> 3084.84s]  As long as you don't see my face, I can do it.
[3089.29s -> 3090.58s]  As long as you don't look at me.
[3090.58s -> 3091.30s]  I know what you said.
[3091.30s -> 3092.98s]  I just didn't think it would happen this soon.
[3096.12s -> 3099.16s]  See, if it was in front of the camera, I would, I wouldn't, I would back out.
[3115.86s -> 3116.36s]  Lock it.
[3117.14s -> 3118.58s]  I can't wait till I fight Doc Vader.
[3119.62s -> 3125.03s]  How come nobody's ever decided to do the strangle to Doc Vader?
[3125.83s -> 3126.33s]  You know?
[3126.79s -> 3129.67s]  Why wouldn't Obi-Wan just stick to like this without strangling Doc Vader?
[3131.19s -> 3143.08s]  They both just, like, it's, it has a better grip at that point, I think.
[3143.72s -> 3149.32s]  Just do that to the Emperor.
[3149.32s -> 3150.36s]  What's he gonna do?
[3150.36s -> 3151.56s]  I will electrocute you.
[3151.56s -> 3152.28s]  Do the Doc Vader.
[3152.28s -> 3155.24s]  He'll, you got an old man by the throat.
[3156.20s -> 3157.88s]  He's not gonna be able to shoot you with electricity.
[3159.24s -> 3164.95s]  Fuck that, dude.
[3164.95s -> 3167.83s]  I would just, I would just, I would just stone cold stun people.
[3167.91s -> 3168.55s]  Like it was before.
[3170.20s -> 3173.08s]  You know, get him, like, round the neck like this and then, like, stun him.
[3176.23s -> 3177.59s]  And they would go, boom!
[3177.59s -> 3178.39s]  And they would launch you up.
[3178.39s -> 3179.27s]  It would be fucking awesome.
[3186.74s -> 3189.37s]  Come on, let's go.
[3189.37s -> 3190.73s]  Now all of a sudden you don't want to.
[3190.73s -> 3206.51s]  Got it.
[3206.89s -> 3211.85s]  You and me.
[3212.63s -> 3213.13s]  You and me.
[3221.10s -> 3222.70s]  I just hit the lady behind me.
[3224.46s -> 3226.14s]  I just, like, right at the lady.
[3267.72s -> 3268.36s]  Just do that.
[3269.98s -> 3271.98s]  Like, you know, as a Jedi, you don't have mana.
[3273.08s -> 3274.04s]  Think about that.
[3274.04s -> 3278.12s]  These motherfuckers waste all their time learning how to sword fight, like, from the 1700s.
[3279.32s -> 3281.48s]  Just go like this and throw people off a cliff.
[3282.71s -> 3284.31s]  What's the, what, what's the point of that?
[3286.62s -> 3289.10s]  Just go like this and push a whole army off a fucking bridge.
[3290.22s -> 3296.18s]  Why would you even ever get in close for any reason?
[3296.98s -> 3301.82s]  This is tiring.
[3301.82s -> 3303.90s]  You get tired doing this shit for more than five minutes.
[3304.70s -> 3309.46s]  Yeah, I just gotta hold my hand out and just concentrate like I'm doing a fucking crossword puzzle
[3309.46s -> 3310.74s]  and I can throw somebody off a bridge?
[3343.77s -> 3347.21s]  The only thing I can think of that would be a problem in doing this is just the trope
[3347.21s -> 3348.57s]  in every single piece of media.
[3349.29s -> 3350.49s]  A slight nosebleed.
[3352.86s -> 3353.36s]  Oh no!
[3355.51s -> 3356.31s]  I did it too long.
[3357.75s -> 3358.87s]  I'll be fine in a second.
[3369.48s -> 3370.68s]  Why do they bleed from their eyes?
[3372.70s -> 3375.82s]  You really want to give some real gravity to that situation?
[3375.82s -> 3376.86s]  A blood out of the eyes.
[3376.86s -> 3378.30s]  And it's like blood.
[3378.30s -> 3379.42s]  Blink, blink, blink, red.
[3379.42s -> 3380.54s]  Blood in the eyes and you can't see.
[3381.66s -> 3386.52s]  Then it'll be like, whoa, shit, you don't want to do that.
[3387.08s -> 3389.61s]  You definitely want to do that shit for more than a minute.
[3389.61s -> 3391.24s]  You won't be able to see.
[3398.76s -> 3400.44s]  Oh shit, it's been 57 minutes.
[3402.28s -> 3403.72s]  We're supposed to be done in 30.
[3403.72s -> 3405.96s]  We're supposed to only give everyone these 30 minutes.
[3413.05s -> 3413.55s]  Oops.
[3416.97s -> 3418.25s]  It's me, I'm here.
[3418.25s -> 3420.33s]  Let me just finish this and then I'll do one dance.
[3421.21s -> 3422.33s]  Actually, you know, I can't do a dance.
[3422.33s -> 3422.81s]  Sorry, guys.
[3422.81s -> 3423.85s]  It's been 57 minutes.
[3435.85s -> 3436.97s]  I still don't understand that.
[3438.52s -> 3453.98s]  It's like, oh, chewy, chewy, chewy.
[3458.23s -> 3458.73s]  Chewy.
[3459.43s -> 3471.80s]  I'm way ahead.
[3476.60s -> 3477.80s]  Explosion.
[3477.80s -> 3479.80s]  An explosion launched me.
[3479.80s -> 3480.84s]  I didn't do that.
[3480.84s -> 3482.60s]  That was the explosion on my back.
[3499.74s -> 3500.70s]  Yeah, fuck that, man.
[3500.70s -> 3502.06s]  I would just get a suit of armor.
[3504.70s -> 3507.18s]  I would be in like a steel full suit of armor.
[3507.18s -> 3508.38s]  I just hold my hands out and throw it.
[3508.38s -> 3514.73s]  So that would be a caster.
[3527.83s -> 3530.47s]  That was more embarrassing for you than it was cool for me.
[3531.11s -> 3531.67s]  I will say.
[3541.48s -> 3543.40s]  Chewy, don't do it, Chewy.
[3544.04s -> 3569.10s]  What the fuck?
[3572.58s -> 3575.30s]  This stupid ass boy, Blaine.
[3577.54s -> 3606.92s]  Am I good?
[3606.92s -> 3608.41s]  All right, I'm good.
[3608.41s -> 3611.64s]  Want a Jar Jar?
[3611.64s -> 3612.60s]  I can't do a Jar Jar.
[3614.12s -> 3619.13s]  What's that Chewy doing on the left?
[3619.69s -> 3624.52s]  This Chewy on the left, I think he has like sand in his eyes.
[3625.16s -> 3636.70s]  Let's make him think he did that.
[3636.70s -> 3641.62s]  This shit don't fucking do anything.
[3666.12s -> 3670.09s]  Signed me up.
[3670.09s -> 3672.11s]  Arties.
[3672.57s -> 3677.92s]  How's hair?
[3678.54s -> 3679.96s]  Controlled.
[3679.96s -> 3682.20s]  Although, might need to re-tie it up here.
[3683.16s -> 3688.71s]  Next, next.
[3688.71s -> 3689.21s]  Hold on.
[3689.99s -> 3693.42s]  I can't quit mid-game.
[3694.54s -> 3697.10s]  I'm gonna do this and then I'll dance for you guys.
[3697.90s -> 3703.58s]  I'll dance.
[3704.46s -> 3707.96s]  I need to get the boss.
[3708.52s -> 3709.40s]  It's Darth Vader.
[3710.12s -> 3711.88s]  He's the boss in every one of the video games.
[3713.16s -> 3714.73s]  It's not gonna be anybody else.
[3715.93s -> 3718.87s]  It's just gonna show up.
[3719.67s -> 3721.72s]  It's gonna be a one-on-one scenario.
[3722.52s -> 3729.53s]  Am I driving the...
[3730.17s -> 3744.90s]  How about you do something?
[3745.62s -> 3747.22s]  How about you do something?
[3749.88s -> 3751.32s]  I have to do the work for both of us?
[3752.12s -> 3759.78s]  I know that you just had your hands lightly on it.
[3760.42s -> 3775.76s]  Nice work.
[3776.70s -> 3788.28s]  You need to do a Chewy?
[3789.16s -> 3791.96s]  Does the lizard people have Chewy sounds?
[3792.92s -> 3821.03s]  What's that?
[3821.03s -> 3821.67s]  Darth Vader.
[3826.39s -> 3837.96s]  It's tricky.
[3841.59s -> 3842.23s]  Tricky here.
[3842.87s -> 3846.54s]  Grab somebody.
[3847.10s -> 3857.44s]  Alright, we're good.
[3863.21s -> 3863.71s]  Yeah!
[3868.44s -> 3869.48s]  Oh no, they must...
[3870.28s -> 3871.64s]  Oh, that went quick.
[3871.64s -> 3875.64s]  I don't wanna fucking stop.
[3875.64s -> 3876.14s]  I really don't.
[3877.02s -> 3885.60s]  Oh, shit.
[3885.60s -> 3886.10s]  God.
[3887.12s -> 3888.32s]  See you later.
[3888.32s -> 3889.84s]  That guy was expendable.
[3891.52s -> 3892.00s]  Ah, man.
[3892.00s -> 3892.50s]  I'm fine.
[3893.76s -> 3896.60s]  This is so stupid.
[3896.60s -> 3905.10s]  Did you tell me to duck?
[3905.82s -> 3906.62s]  Did it on instinct.
[3906.62s -> 3907.66s]  Put the saber down.
[3911.61s -> 3915.85s]  Easy.
[3915.85s -> 3916.35s]  Got it.
[3933.20s -> 3934.48s]  No, I'm fine, Xbox.
[3935.52s -> 3936.24s]  I need a full...
[3937.12s -> 3937.44s]  Ball...
[3937.44s -> 3938.56s]  Oh, I need three servings.
[3938.56s -> 3939.68s]  Oh, failed to pull the spring.
[3939.68s -> 3940.32s]  I'll be alright.
[3953.55s -> 3954.43s]  Oh, my God.
[3955.23s -> 3974.20s]  We're good?
[3974.28s -> 3981.66s]  Was this supposed to happen?
[3982.38s -> 3987.61s]  It's like another part of the scene?
[4001.18s -> 4002.14s]  Uh, what do we do now?
[4003.18s -> 4020.04s]  Get off!
[4020.04s -> 4024.76s]  Come on, get yours, hurry up!
[4036.62s -> 4037.50s]  When will it end?
[4039.68s -> 4041.92s]  When you hear, off camera...
[4046.46s -> 4047.26s]  And he steps in.
[4047.26s -> 4047.82s]  And he goes...
[4051.82s -> 4055.36s]  Here it comes.
[4055.36s -> 4063.84s]  The walk.
[4063.84s -> 4064.80s]  Five of his attacks.
[4065.84s -> 4067.76s]  And then, there'll be an explosion,
[4067.76s -> 4068.96s]  and then the anger and...
[4069.36s -> 4071.04s]  I'll take care of you next time.
[4071.04s -> 4073.76s]  Non-canon dickhead, and he'll just walk away.
[4073.76s -> 4100.80s]  This is a long chapter.
[4106.89s -> 4108.01s]  This is the Clone Wars.
[4108.01s -> 4108.65s]  That doesn't matter.
[4110.01s -> 4110.91s]  Think that matters?
[4111.87s -> 4116.35s]  Darth Vader could be eight right now,
[4116.35s -> 4118.51s]  and he's still gonna walk out like eight feet tall.
[4131.18s -> 4132.70s]  Oh, I get...
[4132.70s -> 4133.18s]  Where is the...
[4134.81s -> 4135.85s]  Oh, it's the twins!
[4135.85s -> 4136.41s]  This is...
[4136.41s -> 4137.29s]  Now, this is a fight.
[4137.29s -> 4138.17s]  This is the two twins.
[4139.21s -> 4141.07s]  Tweedle-dee and Tweedle-dum.
[4141.71s -> 4157.98s]  Oh, I got a...
[4158.70s -> 4175.29s]  First base.
[4175.29s -> 4175.79s]  Down.
[4176.73s -> 4202.17s]  What was that?
[4212.76s -> 4214.04s]  How did he hit me?
[4215.08s -> 4216.33s]  How was he hitting me?
[4217.45s -> 4218.33s]  How was he hitting me?
[4219.29s -> 4249.45s]  All right, mine's down.
[4284.09s -> 4286.28s]  Oh, I have to...
[4292.80s -> 4294.32s]  Dance waiting room.
[4294.32s -> 4302.20s]  What was that?
[4302.20s -> 4304.84s]  I do hope your day has been an enjoyable one.
[4305.40s -> 4307.96s]  Your Wookie friend has been very diligent,
[4307.96s -> 4310.44s]  and I believe we are almost ready for takeoff.
[4311.24s -> 4312.62s]  Are you excited?
[4312.62s -> 4313.18s]  I don't know who this is.
[4313.18s -> 4313.98s]  I'm excited.
[4313.98s -> 4314.70s]  This robot?
[4315.58s -> 4319.02s]  I am TC38, and I'm very pleased to meet you.
[4319.82s -> 4321.82s]  Welcome aboard the Star Runner.
[4322.62s -> 4325.53s]  Oh, I'm very sorry.
[4325.53s -> 4328.09s]  The power couplings seem to have failed.
[4330.65s -> 4331.13s]  That's enough.
[4331.13s -> 4331.69s]  Get out of the way.
[4333.13s -> 4344.17s]  Here comes Darth Maul.
[4354.25s -> 4356.46s]  They will not escape us.
[4357.74s -> 4367.08s]  Were those the twins with the masks?
[4367.08s -> 4367.58s]  Oh.
[4370.46s -> 4371.02s]  I did it.
[4372.06s -> 4373.58s]  Oh, God, no.
[4374.62s -> 4377.93s]  Looks like a welcoming party.
[4378.57s -> 4380.20s]  It's friends of yours.
[4380.20s -> 4381.40s]  Is there a chapter selective,
[4381.40s -> 4383.96s]  or am I just playing through the whole game without knowing?
[4383.96s -> 4384.92s]  I believe your friends...
[4387.04s -> 4389.84s]  I believe Chewbacca would like you to take up the main guns.
[4389.84s -> 4390.48s]  We're not friends.
[4390.48s -> 4393.60s]  Because he's quite occupied trying to activate the hyperdrive.
[4393.60s -> 4394.72s]  I am going through the whole game.
[4395.84s -> 4399.61s]  It's been some time since we've been serviced.
[4399.61s -> 4400.89s]  Stop, stop, stop.
[4400.89s -> 4401.53s]  What, and what...
[4403.53s -> 4404.65s]  I'm having a fun time.
[4404.65s -> 4410.83s]  I think you should man the ship and hurry.
[4410.83s -> 4413.55s]  Everybody wants to see the fucking meme dances so bad.
[4413.55s -> 4438.91s]  Abort mission.
[4442.81s -> 4443.69s]  Abort mission.
[4444.57s -> 4448.51s]  You want to dance?
[4448.51s -> 4449.23s]  Fine.
[4449.23s -> 4450.03s]  I'll give you a dance.
[4461.21s -> 4461.61s]  Dance.
[4463.13s -> 4465.42s]  The Millennium Falcon's gone, so it doesn't matter.
[4466.46s -> 4470.36s]  How do I get this in...
[4471.00s -> 4482.25s]  Did I do it?
[4483.05s -> 4486.59s]  I can't get out of here.
[4487.39s -> 4488.11s]  I can't leave.
[4488.83s -> 4493.52s]  I can't leave.
[4496.86s -> 4497.50s]  Exit game.
[4498.30s -> 4503.16s]  I'm stuck here.
[4503.16s -> 4503.64s]  I can't leave.
[4504.76s -> 4506.12s]  Lift your right arm.
[4506.12s -> 4507.24s]  That's to join, isn't it?
[4507.88s -> 4510.52s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[4510.52s -> 4513.47s]  Should I...
[4514.11s -> 4517.04s]  I don't think I can get out of here.
[4525.90s -> 4526.46s]  Xbox.
[4526.46s -> 4527.10s]  Main menu.
[4528.22s -> 4532.06s]  Xbox.
[4532.06s -> 4532.46s]  Exit.
[4533.26s -> 4570.33s]  Connect Star Wars Walkthrough Part 45.
[4570.33s -> 4571.45s]  End of walkthrough.
[4572.89s -> 4573.69s]  We didn't want to switch.
[4573.69s -> 4574.25s]  I'm not switching.
[4574.25s -> 4576.33s]  I just did the only thing I knew how to get out of there.
[4577.93s -> 4579.37s]  We're going to do the thing.
[4579.37s -> 4580.17s]  This thing.
[4580.17s -> 4580.89s]  You're going to go...
[4582.89s -> 4594.17s]  Don't tell me they never gave you what you want, you know?
[4607.16s -> 4608.84s]  I got to give people what they want.
[4608.84s -> 4611.95s]  I'm going to go like this.
[4612.67s -> 4623.36s]  I'm going to be the first idiot to hurt themselves
[4623.36s -> 4625.44s]  playing this stupid Kinect game.
[4625.44s -> 4627.60s]  I'm going to like trip trying to be a funny guy
[4627.60s -> 4628.16s]  and I'm going to like...
[4628.96s -> 4629.84s]  Like run in the wall.
[4631.36s -> 4633.77s]  Up to do be careful.
[4633.77s -> 4635.61s]  Master Luke has best insisted that we...
[4635.61s -> 4636.17s]  Louder!
[4639.04s -> 4640.00s]  Did I corrupt my save?
[4640.00s -> 4640.96s]  No, please.
[4640.96s -> 4642.08s]  This is a very important site.
[4642.08s -> 4643.36s]  Did did did did did did did did!
[4643.36s -> 4643.68s]  Yes!
[4643.68s -> 4644.00s]  Stop!
[4644.00s -> 4645.12s]  Care less if you...
[4645.12s -> 4647.96s]  Oh, hello AMC 3PO.
[4647.96s -> 4650.68s]  Human-Cyborg relations at your surface.
[4650.68s -> 4652.36s]  Master Luke said we would meet you here.
[4658.24s -> 4663.61s]  You've been recognized.
[4663.61s -> 4664.81s]  So I continue to play?
[4664.81s -> 4665.77s]  Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[4665.77s -> 4666.73s]  All right, here we go.
[4667.77s -> 4677.88s]  I have both lightsabers and shit and everybody wants to spree you.
[4677.88s -> 4678.44s]  There it is.
[4678.44s -> 4679.00s]  Slot one.
[4679.64s -> 4683.71s]  Oh, yes, R2.
[4683.71s -> 4685.07s]  We're all eager to get going.
[4685.07s -> 4686.35s]  I think I bit my cheek.
[4688.56s -> 4689.68s]  Yeah, I bit my cheek, I think.
[4689.68s -> 4690.64s]  I think the stream...
[4690.64s -> 4691.52s]  I have to leave.
[4692.72s -> 4694.08s]  Oh, oh, stream over, I think.
[4697.10s -> 4699.42s]  Dear, this archive appears to have been merged
[4699.42s -> 4701.74s]  with a Torgian Entertainment's dispatch.
[4701.74s -> 4703.26s]  It's completely corrupted.
[4703.26s -> 4703.58s]  Still...
[4703.58s -> 4704.70s]  I have a hangnail right here.
[4704.70s -> 4705.58s]  ...sometimes prove...
[4705.58s -> 4706.94s]  Ooh, ow, ow, ooh.
[4706.94s -> 4707.74s]  ...should we take a little look?
[4707.74s -> 4708.78s]  I can't stream today.
[4709.42s -> 4710.62s]  I'm sorry, guys, I can't.
[4712.30s -> 4715.08s]  Here we are, Commander.
[4715.08s -> 4715.64s]  Ready to go.
[4718.80s -> 4719.76s]  Song title.
[4720.80s -> 4722.88s]  Who am I going to play as?
[4723.60s -> 4724.64s]  I guess I'm going to be...
[4724.88s -> 4731.40s]  I can't be the stormtrooper?
[4731.40s -> 4733.40s]  Of course I know what I'm talking about, R2.
[4733.40s -> 4736.20s]  In fact, there are several afterimports of documentation
[4736.20s -> 4738.20s]  based entirely on that routine.
[4738.20s -> 4740.20s]  And I would have unlocked it.
[4740.20s -> 4742.20s]  How do I get a layup?
[4742.20s -> 4745.34s]  I would have gotten one of these characters.
[4745.34s -> 4748.54s]  Wrong story.
[4748.54s -> 4753.40s]  You know, I don't know why you're here, R2.
[4753.40s -> 4755.40s]  Isn't there something that needs fixing somewhere?
[4755.40s -> 4759.64s]  Well, then, be quiet while the Commander thinks.
[4759.64s -> 4761.64s]  Song title.
[4761.64s -> 4763.64s]  I'm afraid we can't do anything.
[4763.64s -> 4775.29s]  I'm afraid we can't offer any advice.
[4775.29s -> 4777.29s]  I've never been fitted with a strategy chip.
[4777.29s -> 4779.29s]  And R2's broke a long time ago.
[4779.29s -> 4783.29s]  Well, I wouldn't call those good decisions, R2.
[4783.29s -> 4787.29s]  It's a miracle we even survive some of your decisions.
[4787.29s -> 4791.29s]  There, there, there, there, there, there, that one, there.
[4791.29s -> 4793.29s]  Wait, what do you mean, there? Han Solo?
[4793.29s -> 4797.60s]  Oh, yeah, this is an app. I know. People love this one.
[4797.60s -> 4799.60s]  It's a continual fascination to me
[4799.60s -> 4801.60s]  that simple, repetitive audio output
[4801.60s -> 4803.60s]  and the varying decibels of...
[4803.60s -> 4805.60s]  Enjoy a VOD.
[4805.60s -> 4808.03s]  People that are watching the VOD,
[4808.03s -> 4810.03s]  have a great rest of your night.
[4810.03s -> 4827.69s]  I'll see you next time.
[4827.69s -> 4831.47s]  I'm going to go all out for this, though.
[4831.47s -> 4833.47s]  If you think for you, I'm just going to be like,
[4833.47s -> 4835.47s]  oh, funny. No, I'm fucking going to do this.
[4835.47s -> 4837.47s]  Stick it as hard as I can.
[4837.47s -> 4856.35s]  Right?
[4856.35s -> 4858.35s]  That was a pretty good one.
[4858.35s -> 4860.35s]  You looked the part, but let's see some of your moves.
[4860.35s -> 4862.35s]  I haven't seen this.
[4867.66s -> 4876.86s]  Never done this before.
[4900.68s -> 4902.68s]  But I answered to ain't a picture in the palace
[4902.68s -> 4904.68s]  No
[4904.68s -> 4906.68s]  And since the carbonite's off me
[4906.68s -> 4908.68s]  I'm living life now that I'm free
[4908.68s -> 4910.68s]  Yeah
[4910.68s -> 4912.68s]  Told me get myself together
[4912.68s -> 4914.68s]  Now I got myself together
[4914.68s -> 4916.68s]  Now I made it through the weather
[4916.68s -> 4918.68s]  Better days are going to get better
[4918.68s -> 4920.68s]  I'm so happy
[4920.68s -> 4922.68s]  The carbonite is gone
[4928.19s -> 4930.56s]  Who dances like this?
[4930.56s -> 4940.48s]  Solo, solo
[4940.48s -> 4942.48s]  Picking up my plants to put in all my
[4942.48s -> 4944.48s]  Ow, I hit those. I can't hit a song.
[4944.48s -> 4946.48s]  I'm solo
[4946.48s -> 4948.48s]  I'm hunting solo
[4948.48s -> 4950.48s]  I'm hunting solo, solo
[4950.48s -> 4954.00s]  Solo, solo
[4954.00s -> 4956.00s]  I'm hunting solo, solo
[4956.00s -> 4965.77s]  I'm hunting solo, solo
[4965.77s -> 4980.04s]  I'm hunting solo
[4980.04s -> 4982.04s]  It feels so good
[4982.04s -> 4984.04s]  Stop feeling misunderstood
[4984.04s -> 4986.04s]  Back in the game, who knew I would
[4986.04s -> 4988.04s]  So flat, time I spread my wings
[4988.04s -> 4990.04s]  Loving myself makes me want to sing
[4990.04s -> 4992.04s]  Loving myself makes me want to sing
[4992.04s -> 4995.12s]  No more
[4995.12s -> 4997.12s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[4997.12s -> 4999.12s]  Told me get myself together
[4999.12s -> 5001.12s]  Now I got myself together
[5001.12s -> 5003.12s]  Now I made it through the weather
[5003.12s -> 5005.12s]  Better days are going to get better
[5005.12s -> 5007.12s]  I'm so happy
[5007.12s -> 5009.12s]  The carbonite is gone
[5009.12s -> 5013.08s]  A movie that is over now
[5013.08s -> 5022.30s]  A movie that is over now
[5022.30s -> 5024.30s]  I'm solo, I'm hunting solo
[5024.30s -> 5026.30s]  I'm hunting solo, I'm hunting solo
[5026.30s -> 5028.30s]  They look like a star
[5028.30s -> 5030.30s]  You can't stop my shine
[5030.30s -> 5032.30s]  I'm loving class city, my head is in the sky
[5032.30s -> 5034.30s]  I'm solo, I'm hunting solo
[5034.30s -> 5036.30s]  I'm hunting solo
[5036.30s -> 5038.30s]  I'm hunting solo, solo
[5134.76s -> 5137.12s]  That's a lot of money, thanks a lot man
[5137.12s -> 5140.71s]  So I can do it again?
[5141.71s -> 5144.33s]  Advanced? I can't do advanced yet
[5144.33s -> 5148.08s]  Alright, I'm getting five stars
[5149.08s -> 5154.78s]  Of course I know what I'm talking about R2
[5154.78s -> 5157.78s]  In fact, there are several outer rim forms of communication
[5157.78s -> 5159.78s]  Based entirely on dance routines
[5160.78s -> 5207.88s]  Cloud City is always looking for new talent
[5207.88s -> 5209.88s]  You think you have what it takes?
[5229.46s -> 5230.96s]  Like a star, you keep my shine
[5230.96s -> 5233.63s]  I'm cloud city, my head is in the sky
[5233.63s -> 5235.63s]  I'm solo, I'm hunting solo
[5235.63s -> 5237.63s]  I'm hunting solo, I'm hunting solo
[5237.63s -> 5239.63s]  Solo
[5239.63s -> 5241.63s]  Yeah, I'm feeling good tonight
[5241.63s -> 5243.63s]  Finally feeling free and it feels alright
[5243.63s -> 5246.63s]  Oh, time to do the things I like
[5246.63s -> 5248.63s]  Gonna see your princess, everything's alright
[5248.63s -> 5251.63s]  Oh, no job or to answer to
[5251.63s -> 5253.63s]  Ain't a fixture in the palace zoo
[5253.63s -> 5256.63s]  No, and since the carbonite's off me
[5256.63s -> 5258.63s]  I'm living life now that I'm free
[5259.63s -> 5261.63s]  Trying to get myself together
[5261.63s -> 5263.63s]  Now I got myself together
[5264.63s -> 5266.63s]  Now I made it through the weather
[5266.63s -> 5268.63s]  Better days are gonna get better
[5268.63s -> 5271.63s]  I'm so happy the carbonite is gone
[5271.63s -> 5277.56s]  Happy that it's over now
[5277.56s -> 5278.56s]  The pain is gone
[5278.56s -> 5281.82s]  I'm ashamed to cover up my eyes
[5281.82s -> 5284.44s]  I'm jumping in my ride tonight
[5284.44s -> 5286.44s]  I'm solo, I'm hunting solo
[5286.44s -> 5288.44s]  I'm hunting solo, I'm hunting solo
[5288.44s -> 5289.44s]  Solo
[5289.44s -> 5292.44s]  I'm picking up my plaster, putting it on my sign
[5292.44s -> 5294.88s]  I'm jumping in my falcon, put my sign
[5294.88s -> 5296.88s]  I'm solo, I'm hunting solo
[5296.88s -> 5298.88s]  I'm hunting solo, I'm hunting solo
[5298.88s -> 5300.88s]  Solo
[5303.08s -> 5304.08s]  Solo
[5304.08s -> 5305.08s]  Did I get it wrong?
[5305.08s -> 5327.97s]  What am I talking about?
[5327.97s -> 5329.97s]  Why should you join me in life?
[5329.97s -> 5330.97s]  It feels so good
[5330.97s -> 5332.97s]  Oh, stop feeling misunderstood
[5332.97s -> 5334.97s]  Back in the game, who knew?
[5334.97s -> 5338.68s]  I was spraying my wings
[5338.68s -> 5340.68s]  Loving myself makes me wanna sing
[5340.68s -> 5343.92s]  Oh, yeah
[5343.92s -> 5345.92s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[5346.92s -> 5348.92s]  Told me to get my act together
[5348.92s -> 5350.92s]  Now I got my act together
[5350.92s -> 5351.92s]  Yeah
[5351.92s -> 5353.92s]  Now I made it through the weather
[5353.92s -> 5355.92s]  Better days are gonna get better
[5355.92s -> 5359.29s]  I'm so happy the carbonite is gone
[5359.29s -> 5364.88s]  I'm so happy that it's over now
[5364.88s -> 5365.88s]  The pain is gone
[5365.88s -> 5368.63s]  I'm ashamed to cover up my eyes
[5368.63s -> 5370.63s]  I'm jumping in my ride tonight
[5370.63s -> 5371.63s]  I'm getting down tonight
[5371.63s -> 5373.63s]  I'm solo, I'm hunting solo
[5373.63s -> 5375.63s]  I'm hunting solo, I'm hunting solo
[5375.63s -> 5376.63s]  Solo
[5376.63s -> 5378.63s]  I feel like a star, you can't stop my shine
[5378.63s -> 5381.63s]  I'm loving plasticity, my head's in the sky
[5381.63s -> 5383.63s]  I'm solo, I'm hunting solo
[5383.63s -> 5385.63s]  I'm hunting solo, I'm hunting solo
[5385.63s -> 5387.63s]  Solo
[5391.34s -> 5411.91s]  Shit!
[5411.91s -> 5413.91s]  Ripping stuff off the wall
[5413.91s -> 5437.48s]  Retro...
[5437.48s -> 5438.48s]  Okay, I got advanced difficulty
[5438.48s -> 5440.48s]  That's not how I'm gonna be able to do that
[5440.48s -> 5455.38s]  Do I get more points?
[5455.38s -> 5457.38s]  I can only do this song like one more time
[5457.38s -> 5460.38s]  before people start to hear it in their sleep
[5460.38s -> 5462.38s]  Alright, this is it
[5462.38s -> 5464.73s]  Whatever happens, happens
[5464.73s -> 5465.73s]  And I'm moving on
[5465.73s -> 5468.53s]  I'm so sorry
[5468.53s -> 5470.71s]  That it's gonna be over now
[5470.71s -> 5473.97s]  But we gotta move on
[5473.97s -> 5478.20s]  I feel like a star
[5478.20s -> 5480.33s]  Let's go!
[5480.33s -> 5482.33s]  Always knew the general solo was not to be trusted
[5482.33s -> 5484.33s]  This final proves it
[5484.33s -> 5491.12s]  Was that... did I pick difficulty?
[5491.12s -> 5507.01s]  I didn't get the very difficulty
[5507.01s -> 5508.01s]  It's kinda casual
[5508.01s -> 5510.01s]  What's that?
[5510.01s -> 5512.01s]  I have to... I have to do that to fail, right?
[5512.01s -> 5514.01s]  I... I don't know how I get out of it
[5514.01s -> 5516.01s]  There's no way to get out
[5516.01s -> 5520.98s]  You can unlock Darth Vader singing this
[5520.98s -> 5523.95s]  Wait, there it is
[5523.95s -> 5554.04s]  He's not joking
[5554.04s -> 5556.04s]  You can unlock alternate voice tracks
[5556.04s -> 5557.04s]  Keep up the good work, commander
[5557.04s -> 5559.04s]  We're really getting to the heart of this dictum
[5559.04s -> 5560.04s]  I'm not doing this one again
[5560.04s -> 5561.04s]  May I respectfully remind you
[5561.04s -> 5564.04s]  that you have not yet viewed the advanced musical sequence
[5564.04s -> 5567.04s]  for the I'm Han Solo audio track
[5567.04s -> 5568.04s]  Thank you
[5568.04s -> 5570.04s]  Advanced
[5570.04s -> 5573.94s]  This is it, this is the one
[5573.94s -> 5576.50s]  Alright, so it's that
[5576.50s -> 5577.50s]  the pose, not this
[5577.50s -> 5579.50s]  I do it wrong every time

[5603.09s -> 5610.36s]  You gotta, you gotta do, you gotta do
[5610.36s -> 5612.36s]  Man, every young hot shot needs a man
[5612.36s -> 5614.36s]  Let's go up here
[5620.63s -> 5622.87s]  It's being that guy back there

[8291.93s -> 8314.86s]  go. You're keeping us all
[8321.58s -> 8325.95s]  If I was 13.
[8333.45s -> 8349.30s]  Fire 33. I played.
[8349.38s -> 8350.80s]  He thought that each one is an
[8350.88s -> 8368.90s]  individual story. I like that.
[8368.96s -> 8377.81s]  Oh god. Now, we got a tan guy.
[8377.81s -> 8410.40s]  Write your symbol tomorrow.
[8410.46s -> 8424.14s]  I don't have to carry my ball.
[8424.20s -> 8430.44s]  Which one? No, I'm worried.
[8430.50s -> 8443.94s]  What if I jumped and just went
[8444.00s -> 8445.94s]  through the ground? Just like
[8446.00s -> 8460.06s]  here we go. Here we go. I want
[8460.14s -> 8468.40s]  to get I want to get like a
[8468.48s -> 8495.69s]  hundred hit combo. Let's go.
[8495.75s -> 8538.90s]  Let's go. What's this?
[8538.92s -> 8586.90s]  Good.
[8586.96s -> 8592.21s]  Right here.
[8592.27s -> 8597.73s]  This is done. This arm is done.
[8597.79s -> 8601.32s]  I can't I can't I can't do it
[8601.38s -> 8621.67s]  anymore with this arm. When you
[8621.73s -> 8652.82s]  get this. This is fun. I need
[8652.90s -> 8665.63s]  like a like a stick.
[8665.71s -> 8679.65s]  Just be like. Next. You know,
[8679.67s -> 8680.61s]  I'm like going like this. It's
[8680.67s -> 8681.61s]  like just my arm's gonna throw
[8681.67s -> 8685.61s]  my arm up. If I go like like
[8685.67s -> 8705.30s]  that.
[8705.38s -> 8732.05s]  Did I break it?
[8732.13s -> 8735.05s]  Now, not so tight this time.
[8735.13s -> 8736.07s]  Make sure you do it a little
[8736.13s -> 8741.83s]  looser. That's better. What
[8741.89s -> 8753.95s]  are you going to say about
[8754.01s -> 8768.84s]  that? I think it's time for me
[8768.90s -> 8771.84s]  to kick. It's time to kick your
[8771.86s -> 8811.78s]  ass. It's **** up the sensor.
[8811.84s -> 8812.78s]  It thinks my body's like three
[8812.84s -> 8833.67s]  times longer. What? What? Jerry?
[8833.73s -> 8835.67s]  You're gonna do it together.
[8836.82s -> 8840.71s]  Sorry. Sorry. How did you make
[8840.79s -> 8841.71s]  it like this? Why couldn't you
[8841.79s -> 8846.76s]  just do the command? Victory is
[8846.82s -> 8861.72s]  out. It's like the wrong way.
[8861.78s -> 8864.11s]  The way you look at it. Like
[8864.17s -> 8866.11s]  remember, I'm mirrored. Flame
[8866.13s -> 8878.61s]  badge. Flame badge. Next. I
[8878.69s -> 8880.61s]  gotta go refill that water and
[8880.69s -> 8882.63s]  right after this one. Go, go,
[8882.69s -> 8898.40s]  German Ranger. I'm trying. Why
[8898.46s -> 8910.26s]  would I want to get that on
[8910.32s -> 8914.14s]  camera? Whatever. Your symbol
[8914.20s -> 8928.71s]  tomorrow. Green tongue. Act today.
[8928.77s -> 8954.34s]  I have to use my right hand as
[8954.42s -> 8955.34s]  a weapon because it's hard for
[8955.42s -> 8957.34s]  me to do this now because I
[8957.42s -> 8959.32s]  it's my I'm losing circulation
[8959.38s -> 8961.32s]  here. I'm gonna pick up my
[8961.38s -> 8964.32s]  right hand and use it like this
[8964.38s -> 8967.84s]  because I have no strength.
[8967.90s -> 8985.48s]  That works. He's weak. Weak.
[8985.54s -> 8986.48s]  I've been in the middle of an
[8986.56s -> 8988.48s]  exercise for two and a half
[8988.56s -> 9014.87s]  hours. I can't do it. I have to
[9014.93s -> 9043.06s]  chase him. Oh no. I dodged it.
[9043.12s -> 9044.06s]  Why would you step in? It's
[9044.12s -> 9051.71s]  gonna double tap. You idiot. A
[9051.77s -> 9082.14s]  car. Turn off the power. Alright,
[9082.20s -> 9097.92s]  here we go. Lights are off. Oh
[9097.92s -> 9123.41s]  **** You saw me, dog. Here we
[9123.47s -> 9130.67s]  go. Stop. Activate. Quit
[9130.73s -> 9134.64s]  looking at him. Run after him.
[9134.70s -> 9155.63s]  Boss. Alright, let's go. Three
[9155.71s -> 9162.31s]  three. Fight. I don't have a
[9162.39s -> 9164.31s]  uh I don't have power up yet.
[9164.39s -> 9175.02s]  Let's do this thing. Oh, he's
[9175.08s -> 9180.90s]  snoring.
[9186.28s -> 9191.44s]  Don't go in. Now, wait. Don't
[9198.27s -> 9199.21s]  get hit. Back up. Back up. Back
[9199.27s -> 9200.21s]  up. Back up. Back up. Back up.
[9201.90s -> 9204.63s]  I can't get hit by this. This
[9204.69s -> 9210.26s]  way is he gonna go? Left or
[9210.32s -> 9217.17s]  right? He's doing it again? I
[9217.23s -> 9219.17s]  can't. Get over there. Get over
[9219.23s -> 9238.84s]  there you **** idiot. That's
[9238.92s -> 9285.64s]  good. Thank god it's the
[9285.72s -> 9287.64s]  children. I thought that was
[9287.72s -> 9288.66s]  another camera pointing at me.
[9288.72s -> 9290.66s]  I was like, who put a **** camera
[9292.17s -> 9297.55s]  in my room? It was like facing
[9297.61s -> 9298.55s]  me this way. I was like, why is
[9299.55s -> 9307.64s]  that? Inferno badge. No uh
[9307.70s -> 9314.44s]  Megazord? Next. Why would there
[9314.50s -> 9315.44s]  be no Megazord? Uh after this
[9315.50s -> 9323.16s]  one, we're gonna have to do a
[9323.22s -> 9343.08s]  uh I gave up. I don't have any
[9343.16s -> 9345.57s]  energy to do that. Let me see
[9345.65s -> 9348.41s]  what I do. Uh that's what I do
[9348.47s -> 9350.41s]  with me. You know, that doesn't
[9350.47s -> 9351.41s]  do anything. That doesn't have
[9351.47s -> 9353.41s]  any powers. It's just what they
[9353.47s -> 9355.41s]  chose to do for that particular
[9355.47s -> 9358.37s]  reason. They chose to go like
[9358.45s -> 9360.39s]  this. It doesn't mean that I'm
[9360.45s -> 9361.39s]  not as strong. It's just weak.
[9361.45s -> 9367.11s]  That doesn't do anything. That's
[9367.17s -> 9374.85s]  just for show. Let's get that
[9374.91s -> 9376.85s]  clear. Alright, so it's not this
[9376.91s -> 9381.41s]  way. It's this way, right? I'm
[9381.47s -> 9391.52s]  gonna try to get a first try.
[9391.60s -> 9417.46s]  Go, go Samurai.
[9417.54s -> 9420.23s]  I don't even know you can dump
[9420.29s -> 9453.77s]  with the Megazord. Pink Ranger
[9453.83s -> 9460.94s]  screwed that up. Not very good
[9460.96s -> 9473.61s]  this time. Victory is ours. What
[9473.67s -> 9475.61s]  an awesome show that this was.
[9475.67s -> 9481.74s]  Well, that was great. I love
[9481.80s -> 9485.74s]  that. I love that. I love this
[9485.82s -> 9498.03s]  one. The show was bad. Why do
[9498.09s -> 9502.48s]  you say that? Uh I messed up.
[9502.54s -> 9504.48s]  BitSlave gave ten community
[9504.54s -> 9506.48s]  subs earlier. Thank you BitSlave.
[9506.54s -> 9509.48s]  So this. Ooh that was like 30
[9509.54s -> 9511.48s]  minutes ago. Whoops. I am a
[9511.54s -> 9513.48s]  idiot but thank you for the ten
[9513.48s -> 9518.11s]  subs. Dropping ten subs tonight.
[9518.17s -> 9520.28s]  Today. Whatever time it is. Let's
[9520.34s -> 9522.28s]  do one more. Last one. The
[9522.34s -> 9527.92s]  original show was great. I grew
[9527.98s -> 9529.92s]  up on that show. They had like
[9529.98s -> 9533.95s]  inside that the like the the
[9534.03s -> 9534.95s]  Honker Burger, right? They did
[9535.03s -> 9535.95s]  that the restaurant they would
[9536.03s -> 9537.95s]  eat and hang out and the the
[9538.03s -> 9538.97s]  American actors only record us
[9539.03s -> 9540.97s]  the inside the restaurant scenes
[9541.03s -> 9544.97s]  and like reactions outside. Please
[9545.03s -> 9557.60s]  stop hurting me. It's time to
[9557.60s -> 9560.60s]  finish this. I dodged it.
[9560.66s -> 9567.23s]  Go go samurai. Write your symbol
[9567.29s -> 9594.82s]  tomorrow. Do it. Let it go.
[9594.88s -> 9613.42s]  That's like on a wedding fucking
[9613.48s -> 9615.42s]  photographer. What the fuck are
[9615.48s -> 9617.42s]  you doing? You got it when like
[9617.50s -> 9618.42s]  drunk Uncle Frank was forward?
[9618.50s -> 9620.42s]  Not when he was like juggling
[9620.50s -> 9638.16s]  upside down? God damn it. I was
[9638.22s -> 9639.16s]  gonna go straight up in the air
[9639.22s -> 9640.16s]  but like literally you would
[9640.22s -> 9642.16s]  have just like my my fucking
[9642.22s -> 9643.16s]  reverse upper body underwear
[9643.16s -> 9651.09s]  would have come up. The T-Pose.
[9651.15s -> 9653.09s]  The T-Pose. A little blood like
[9653.15s -> 9656.00s]  brush to my head. I don't know
[9656.06s -> 9657.00s]  how people stay upside down for
[9657.06s -> 9668.45s]  that one. Alright, last one and
[9668.51s -> 9669.45s]  then I'm gonna get some water
[9669.51s -> 9670.45s]  and we're gonna move on to a
[9670.51s -> 9673.45s]  relaxing one. Today, you will
[9673.53s -> 9675.45s]  fall to my sword with my sword.
[9675.53s -> 9677.47s]  They come up. Oh, that's such a
[9677.53s -> 9681.47s]  strong right input. Jump.
[9698.41s -> 9702.35s]  Excellent. That's kinda cool.
[9704.49s -> 9715.30s]  Watch it. Let's dodge it. Yeah,
[9715.36s -> 9740.01s]  there we go. Can I get in? No.
[9740.07s -> 9741.01s]  There comes a bottom slash,
[9741.07s -> 9784.98s]  right? Okay, we're good.
[9785.04s -> 9785.98s]  Searching for the project. What?
[9787.50s -> 9793.26s]  I can't hear him. Let's do this
[9793.34s -> 9796.14s]  please.
[9798.22s -> 9805.48s]  Connect is broken. The connect
[9805.54s -> 9823.00s]  is broken. It doesn't work.
[9823.06s -> 9824.00s]  This guy says yes. I got the
[9824.08s -> 9872.08s]  wrong calibration. Get out of
[9872.16s -> 9892.32s]  here. I gotta recalibrate the
[9892.38s -> 9895.32s]  head. Water. Retie this.
[9895.38s -> 9898.32s]  Splash, splash. Moisturize.
[9898.38s -> 9901.20s]  Dump like a cup of water down my
[9901.26s -> 9908.26s]  pants. See? That's bullshit. I'm
[9908.34s -> 9909.26s]  not even getting the points on
[9909.34s -> 9929.38s]  my ID. I got fired. I got
[9929.46s -> 9935.40s]  recast. Re, uh, casting call.
[9935.48s -> 9945.76s]  Interesting. You want some?
[9945.82s -> 9948.83s]  I was trying to use last
[9948.89s -> 9952.83s]  weekend. Go, go Samurai. Okay.
[9952.91s -> 9959.72s]  Write your symbol tomorrow. No,
[9959.78s -> 9977.66s]  no, no, no, no. I ain't doing
[9977.72s -> 9999.42s]  another one. Q-R-N-T-U-V. Hey,
[9999.48s -> 10004.16s]  we're back. He said the line.
[10004.22s -> 10005.85s]  He did. Sometimes he does. All
[10005.93s -> 10006.85s]  right, here we go. Let me get
[10006.93s -> 10013.59s]  the piece of water. I'll be back
[10013.65s -> 10014.59s]  in like two minutes, three
[10014.65s -> 10016.59s]  minutes. I'm gonna go pee.
[10016.65s -> 10021.75s]  Please do Q-R-S again. I can't.
[10023.01s -> 10027.28s]  That was a night that will, I
[10027.36s -> 10028.28s]  could never do that again, I
[10028.36s -> 10030.30s]  don't think. It was just, I
[10030.36s -> 10033.78s]  can't replicate that ever
[10033.84s -> 10038.91s]  again. I can try to emulate the
[10038.97s -> 10040.91s]  thing. Like, oh, it's not, no
[10040.97s -> 10044.98s]  way. I can't emulate that.
[10045.04s -> 10050.49s]  Sweat check. It's all right. I
[10050.55s -> 10051.49s]  mean, I'm a little, I'm a
[10051.55s -> 10053.49s]  little, I got some film on me
[10053.57s -> 10055.53s]  but it's fine. I'll be right
[10055.61s -> 10057.53s]  back. We're gonna do, we're
[10057.61s -> 10060.02s]  gonna chill out. We're gonna do
[10060.10s -> 10066.79s]  a slow paced one. See you in a
[10066.85s -> 10328.85s]  minute. I'm back. Okay. So,
[10328.91s -> 10331.35s]  we've done a little, we've done
[10331.41s -> 10333.35s]  some intensity. I think it's
[10333.43s -> 10336.35s]  time to do something where we
[10336.43s -> 10339.80s]  just hang out and get through
[10339.86s -> 10342.80s]  one of these more relaxed ones.
[10342.86s -> 10351.34s]  Family Feud? No. Far worse.
[10351.40s -> 10363.90s]  It's not Disney again. I
[10363.94s -> 10375.63s]  promise. I redid the hair.
[10375.69s -> 10377.63s]  Splash some water. I dumped a
[10377.71s -> 10380.90s]  whole soda down here. Right.
[10380.98s -> 10386.78s]  Probably should put this in.
[10386.86s -> 10390.60s]  This Bluetooth headset actually
[10390.66s -> 10392.60s]  goes pretty far. I can hear
[10392.66s -> 10394.84s]  everything you guys are saying.
[10394.90s -> 10397.90s]  Some of them are more nice than
[10397.96s -> 10398.90s]  other room comments. Speaking
[10398.98s -> 10409.87s]  of not being able to hear
[10409.95s -> 10410.87s]  things, why can I not hear it
[10410.95s -> 10415.37s]  now? Power off. What do you mean
[10415.45s -> 10428.26s]  power off? What do you mean
[10428.32s -> 10430.26s]  power off? Hold up your arm and
[10430.32s -> 10432.26s]  wave at the screen to begin.
[10432.30s -> 10444.42s]  Power on. Battery fully charged.
[10444.48s -> 10446.78s]  It's talking to me. I have my
[10446.84s -> 10448.78s]  own like Iron Man suit in here.
[10448.84s -> 10451.34s]  Okay, so Bluetooth connected.
[10451.40s -> 10455.64s]  Now, there we are. So, this is
[10455.70s -> 10457.64s]  called Fantastic Pets and Where
[10457.70s -> 10459.64s]  to Find Them. Hopefully not in
[10464.10s -> 10466.60s]  a movie theater if that series
[10466.66s -> 10470.44s]  is bad. Okay, welcome to the
[10470.50s -> 10473.44s]  game, Tender Dragoon 74. That
[10473.52s -> 10483.81s]  was an easy joke. Continue with
[10483.89s -> 10486.83s]  this gamer profile. Hey there.
[10486.89s -> 10488.87s]  Welcome to the game. I told you
[10488.93s -> 10491.39s]  we were going to relax on this
[10491.45s -> 10492.39s]  one. This is just for me to
[10492.45s -> 10493.39s]  catch my breath for like 12
[10493.45s -> 10495.39s]  minutes and then we'll play in
[10495.45s -> 10500.45s]  a horror game. This is you make
[10500.51s -> 10508.30s]  your own pet like a the one,
[10508.38s -> 10510.48s]  the thing in your hand. Visitor
[10510.56s -> 10513.76s]  detected. Hi there. I've been
[10513.82s -> 10514.76s]  expecting you. This is a
[10514.82s -> 10516.76s]  computer? Welcome to Dr.
[10516.82s -> 10518.76s]  Menagerie's house. I'm a natural
[10518.82s -> 10521.76s]  interface entity but you can
[10521.84s -> 10523.76s]  call me Natalie. This house
[10523.82s -> 10527.36s]  belongs to Dr. Menagerie. He's
[10527.42s -> 10530.36s]  an expert in fantastic pets.
[10530.42s -> 10533.54s]  Also, he's like splicing DNA. I
[10533.60s -> 10535.54s]  probably should have mentioned
[10535.60s -> 10536.54s]  that first. We got you got me
[10536.60s -> 10538.54s]  like rolls here. He's in here
[10538.60s -> 10539.54s]  right now but he left you a
[10539.60s -> 10543.54s]  message. Cats, dogs, animals,
[10543.62s -> 10544.54s]  dragons of the same house in
[10544.62s -> 10552.11s]  the same room. I imagine it must
[10552.17s -> 10554.11s]  stink in here. Hello. I don't
[10554.17s -> 10555.11s]  suppose you remember me but it
[10555.17s -> 10557.11s]  has been a long time. I'm your
[10557.13s -> 10559.13s]  uncle, Dr. Menagerie. I'm a
[10559.21s -> 10561.13s]  doctor of zoology. That's the
[10561.21s -> 10562.15s]  study of how animals and humans
[10562.21s -> 10564.15s]  interact and live with each other.
[10564.21s -> 10565.15s]  It's fascinating work and it
[10565.21s -> 10567.15s]  takes me all over the world in
[10567.21s -> 10568.15s]  search of rare and fantastic
[10568.21s -> 10570.15s]  species which is why I'm
[10570.21s -> 10571.15s]  sending you this message. There
[10571.21s -> 10573.15s]  are loads of rare and exotic
[10573.21s -> 10575.15s]  animals living in my house and
[10575.21s -> 10577.15s]  I'm even. I'm afraid you're a
[10577.23s -> 10579.15s]  little too close. Try moving
[10579.23s -> 10582.74s]  back. So, head over to the
[10582.82s -> 10584.72s]  house and choose your first pet.
[10584.78s -> 10586.72s]  Oh, by the way, you'll meet
[10586.78s -> 10587.72s]  Natalie there. She'll help you
[10587.80s -> 10589.78s]  along. Can't he tell me that?
[10589.84s -> 10592.78s]  Good luck. Just watch her on my
[10592.84s -> 10595.78s]  shoulder. Why can't, why can't
[10595.84s -> 10597.76s]  he just say, hey, back up? He
[10597.82s -> 10600.76s]  stops talking. Hey, hey, hey,
[10600.82s -> 10602.76s]  hey. Easy over there. You can
[10602.82s -> 10603.76s]  spend as long as you like with
[10603.82s -> 10605.76s]  each pet before choosing one to
[10605.82s -> 10607.76s]  take home with you. The door is
[10607.82s -> 10617.83s]  just open. We have all sorts of
[10617.91s -> 10619.83s]  pets here from cats, dogs,
[10619.91s -> 10622.81s]  ponies, and lizards to the rare
[10622.87s -> 10625.87s]  and secret fantastic pets. These
[10625.93s -> 10626.87s]  are animals the rest of the
[10626.93s -> 10628.87s]  world doesn't know about like
[10628.93s -> 10633.86s]  dragons or unicorns. By the way,
[10633.92s -> 10635.86s]  the reason you can't see me is
[10635.92s -> 10637.86s]  that I'm a computer. I'm the
[10637.92s -> 10639.86s]  house you're in, I suppose. It's
[10639.92s -> 10641.86s]  my job to help your uncle look
[10641.92s -> 10642.86s]  after all the pets that decide
[10642.92s -> 10644.86s]  to come home with him. This is
[10644.94s -> 10646.86s]  over there. Dragon like takes a
[10646.94s -> 10648.86s]  dump in the corner. There's like
[10648.94s -> 10652.76s]  puke in the corner, pee. Okay,
[10652.84s -> 10655.84s]  let's go. On to the main event,
[10655.92s -> 10661.74s]  the pet. Don't don't act like
[10661.80s -> 10662.74s]  that's not what would happen
[10662.80s -> 10666.84s]  here. What what a cruel little
[10666.90s -> 10667.84s]  grass you got. Look at your
[10667.90s -> 10668.84s]  carpets. That's why you got
[10668.90s -> 10672.66s]  hardwoods installed. The icons
[10672.72s -> 10673.66s]  you can see all over the street
[10673.72s -> 10675.66s]  are my movement system. With the
[10675.72s -> 10676.66s]  door open. They let me move
[10676.74s -> 10677.66s]  around the house with you.
[10677.74s -> 10679.66s]  There is probably like a shit
[10679.74s -> 10681.68s]  log hidden behind a lamp
[10681.74s -> 10682.68s]  somewhere in this house. So we
[10682.74s -> 10684.68s]  hold your hand out and a cursor
[10684.74s -> 10686.68s]  will appear on the screen. Now,
[10686.74s -> 10687.68s]  move that cursor over the
[10687.74s -> 10688.68s]  choice you'd like to have. Cat,
[10688.76s -> 10692.78s]  dog, unicorn, or lizard? Lizard
[10692.84s -> 10698.69s]  pull. To help you choose, your
[10698.75s -> 10699.69s]  uncle has left you a file on
[10699.75s -> 10701.69s]  each of the pets that you can
[10701.75s -> 10706.17s]  choose to adopt. Oh, look at
[10706.23s -> 10709.17s]  him. Hello Nomad. Nomad joined
[10709.25s -> 10710.17s]  us from the deserts of Africa
[10710.25s -> 10712.15s]  where she spent her days sun
[10712.21s -> 10714.15s]  bathing. Apparently Nomad
[10714.21s -> 10715.15s]  decided to leave the desert
[10715.21s -> 10717.15s]  because she was fed up with sand
[10717.21s -> 10718.15s]  getting into everything. Oh,
[10718.21s -> 10720.15s]  that's so cute. Okay, I don't
[10720.23s -> 10722.15s]  know how to choose. Okay, let's
[10722.31s -> 10724.31s]  go. I need to get a prop on the
[10724.37s -> 10727.35s]  house. This is Sadie. All right,
[10727.41s -> 10732.55s]  let's go to Sadie's store. Say
[10732.61s -> 10733.85s]  hello to one of our most
[10733.91s -> 10736.71s]  mischievous pets, Sadie. Sadie
[10736.79s -> 10738.09s]  loves to see what's going on
[10738.15s -> 10739.89s]  behind the scenes and to figure
[10739.95s -> 10741.63s]  out how things work. So she's
[10741.69s -> 10743.29s]  always getting into trouble.
[10745.35s -> 10747.47s]  That's on the leg. Okay, always
[10747.53s -> 10753.43s]  getting into trouble. Let's get
[10753.49s -> 10760.01s]  out of here and out. Ember.
[10760.03s -> 10762.17s]  This is Ember, one of our
[10762.23s -> 10764.43s]  newest additions. She loves all
[10764.51s -> 10766.91s]  types of extreme sports. Have
[10766.97s -> 10768.27s]  you ever seen a snowboarding
[10768.33s -> 10771.71s]  lizard? Just incredible. I like
[10771.77s -> 10774.90s]  the handstand. And the back
[10774.96s -> 10776.40s]  flip. I did three of those when
[10776.46s -> 10777.40s]  the stream started. I think
[10777.46s -> 10778.30s]  that might be the one. We've
[10778.36s -> 10787.75s]  got to get them all. Timmy.
[10787.81s -> 10789.95s]  Right next to the camera. Funny
[10790.01s -> 10793.93s]  star. It's the funny one.
[10793.99s -> 10795.63s]  Believe it or not, Timmy is one
[10795.69s -> 10797.57s]  of our shyest pets. He's a
[10797.65s -> 10799.33s]  little wary of new people, but
[10799.39s -> 10800.73s]  if you become friends, then
[10800.79s -> 10802.53s]  you'll never see a more loyal,
[10802.59s -> 10805.47s]  dedicated pet than Timmy.
[10808.33s -> 10811.34s]  Check out Drake. I don't think
[10811.42s -> 10812.12s]  it's going to be Timmy. I think
[10812.18s -> 10817.00s]  it's going to be Ember. Ah, yes.
[10817.08s -> 10818.74s]  This is Drake, one of our
[10818.80s -> 10820.64s]  miniature dragons. He may be
[10820.70s -> 10822.58s]  small, but he's still pretty
[10822.64s -> 10824.62s]  wild. Just watch him fend off a
[10824.68s -> 10827.02s]  fearsome squeaky toy. It's
[10827.08s -> 10835.26s]  strong. Ember. I chose him.
[10835.32s -> 10837.38s]  Handstand, back flips. It's
[10837.44s -> 10841.71s]  going to be Ember. Ember's love
[10841.77s -> 10843.45s]  of extreme sports has made her
[10843.51s -> 10845.77s]  completely fearless. Natalie
[10845.85s -> 10847.15s]  says that watching Ember's
[10847.21s -> 10849.81s]  stunning. Looks like you know
[10849.89s -> 10875.66s]  who's going to take home. It's
[10875.72s -> 10882.29s]  too easy. Wait. Yes. No. Hang
[10882.35s -> 10885.33s]  on. Nearly there. Hello. My
[10885.39s -> 10886.77s]  systems have transferred
[10886.83s -> 10889.77s]  perfectly. Ooh, nice place you've
[10889.79s -> 10892.55s]  got here. Very chic. Thank you.
[10892.63s -> 10894.33s]  Very chic. You like what I'm
[10894.39s -> 10896.33s]  doing with here? I won't go.
[10896.39s -> 10915.95s]  Yes, I'd love to go. Remember I
[10916.01s -> 10917.25s]  told you. Remember I told you.
[10917.31s -> 10918.29s]  I told you. What did I fucking
[10918.35s -> 10920.19s]  tell you? What did I tell you?
[10920.33s -> 10922.03s]  You're too close. Remember I
[10922.09s -> 10923.63s]  said about fucking CGI in movies
[10923.69s -> 10924.63s]  and how like the guy that boom
[10924.69s -> 10925.23s]  boom boom is not like an idiot
[10925.29s -> 10925.97s]  and all of a sudden he has these
[10926.03s -> 10927.07s]  spells? Check this out. Yes,
[10927.13s -> 10931.01s]  they definitely like it here.
[10931.07s -> 10932.51s]  Oh yes, I nearly forgot
[10932.57s -> 10934.61s]  something, which is ironic
[10934.67s -> 10937.11s]  considering I'm a computer.
[10937.17s -> 10939.25s]  This is Avatar, one of Dr.
[10939.31s -> 10942.01s]  Menagerie's assistants. Avatar
[10942.09s -> 10944.91s]  helps out by acting as my hands
[10944.99s -> 10946.29s]  because computers don't have
[10946.29s -> 10951.03s]  the hands of their own, see?
[10951.09s -> 10952.49s]  Try calling your pet over to
[10952.57s -> 10955.07s]  you. You can do it just like you
[10955.13s -> 10957.33s]  would with a real pet. You see
[10957.41s -> 10958.77s]  how Avatar is showing you how
[10958.83s -> 10961.03s]  to call your pet over? Whenever
[10961.11s -> 10963.31s]  you see perfect. Now you can
[10963.37s -> 10964.41s]  call your pet whenever you
[10964.47s -> 10965.75s]  like. This is in the room. There
[10965.81s -> 10967.15s]  are lots of other commands you
[10967.21s -> 10968.77s]  can give to your pet too. So
[10968.85s -> 10973.90s]  try plenty of things out. Now
[10973.96s -> 10976.06s]  let's try a toy, shall we?
[10976.16s -> 10976.96s]  Let's get a toy.
[10977.02s -> 10978.42s]  Let's see.
[10978.50s -> 10980.46s]  Aha, the bubble bubbler, I
[10980.52s -> 10983.70s]  think. The bubble bubbler. Play
[10983.76s -> 10985.20s]  with bubbles by popping and
[10985.26s -> 10989.00s]  swirling them around. Pop the
[10989.06s -> 10996.34s]  bubbles? Three, two, one. Hey!
[10996.42s -> 10998.28s]  Help me pop these. The more
[10998.34s -> 10999.72s]  bubbles the bubble bubbler
[10999.78s -> 11003.80s]  creates. I don't want to. The
[11003.86s -> 11006.65s]  faster you move around, the
[11006.71s -> 11011.09s]  bubble bubbler creates. You're
[11011.15s -> 11012.09s]  going to get me in trouble. I'm
[11012.11s -> 11016.90s]  going to fall. Can you get one?
[11016.96s -> 11022.56s]  You get one too. These are mine.
[11022.62s -> 11030.35s]  I'm destroying it. Did I get
[11030.41s -> 11037.49s]  food too? It makes the bubbler
[11037.55s -> 11042.72s]  release more bubbles. The bubble
[11042.78s -> 11045.66s]  bubbler finished. All of the
[11045.74s -> 11046.80s]  activities will finish by
[11046.86s -> 11048.54s]  themselves. So you don't need
[11048.60s -> 11049.74s]  to tidy them away yourself.
[11049.80s -> 11055.34s]  I didn't even get one. It's just
[11055.34s -> 11061.40s]  a baby. Hey. Hey there. What is
[11061.46s -> 11066.44s]  it? What's up? What's up, girl?
[11066.50s -> 11072.08s]  What do you want to do? Hey. No,
[11072.14s -> 11073.68s]  you can't go that way. Back over
[11073.74s -> 11077.82s]  here. Hey, come here. Come over
[11077.88s -> 11085.36s]  here. Come over here. Come over
[11086.36s -> 11091.82s]  here! Come over here. Come here.
[11091.90s -> 11102.90s]  Hey! Toys? Ball?
[11102.96s -> 11104.60s]  As you unlock more toys, they'll
[11104.66s -> 11106.40s]  appear here. To let me know what
[11106.46s -> 11108.04s]  you'd like to do, simply hold
[11108.10s -> 11109.30s]  your hand out and a cursor will
[11109.38s -> 11111.04s]  appear on the screen. To select
[11111.10s -> 11113.68s]  an icon simply hold your cursor
[11113.74s -> 11115.44s]  over it and I'll do the rest.
[11115.52s -> 11117.42s]  That's not going to work. Let's
[11117.48s -> 11119.08s]  try a game of ball fetch, shall
[11119.08s -> 11125.32s]  Now we move the glowing cursor over the icon and hold it nice and still.
[11125.32s -> 11126.32s]  Ball fetch.
[11126.32s -> 11129.73s]  Right.
[11129.73s -> 11134.71s]  Time to give your pets some exercise in the game of ball fetch.
[11134.71s -> 11135.71s]  Ball fetch.
[11135.71s -> 11137.33s]  Where am I?
[11137.33s -> 11138.33s]  How do I take it?
[11138.33s -> 11144.40s]  Reach towards the screen to take the ball from your pet.
[11144.40s -> 11149.12s]  The markers on the floor display how far your last throw and your longest throw went before
[11149.12s -> 11150.12s]  the ball bounced.
[11150.12s -> 11151.12s]  Nice.
[11151.12s -> 11161.02s]  Alright, I'm going to throw it further.
[11161.02s -> 11163.60s]  Here we go.
[11163.60s -> 11164.60s]  Where did I go?
[11164.60s -> 11168.08s]  I'm currently off.
[11168.08s -> 11169.08s]  I was on camera before in game and I'll be back.
[11169.08s -> 11170.08s]  How did I throw it further than that?
[11170.08s -> 11171.08s]  I'm trying to throw it over the fence.
[11171.08s -> 11172.08s]  I'm not going to be able to do that.
[11172.08s -> 11173.08s]  I'll try.
[11173.08s -> 11174.08s]  I'm afraid you're a little too close.
[11174.08s -> 11175.08s]  Try moving back.
[11175.08s -> 11176.84s]  Just throw the ball for your pet.
[11176.84s -> 11184.03s]  It looks like your pet is enjoying it.
[11184.03s -> 11185.03s]  Do it underhand?
[11185.03s -> 11186.03s]  How did you know I was not doing it underhand?
[11186.03s -> 11188.23s]  All fantastic pets love to play ball fetch.
[11188.23s -> 11189.23s]  That's cute.
[11189.23s -> 11190.23s]  Ball fetch finished.
[11190.23s -> 11196.40s]  Copy the gestures.
[11196.40s -> 11197.40s]  I'll try another one.
[11197.40s -> 11199.34s]  Ball fetch.
[11199.34s -> 11200.34s]  That was cute.
[11200.34s -> 11201.34s]  Ball fetch.
[11201.34s -> 11207.67s]  I'm going to try to throw it over the fence.
[11207.67s -> 11213.80s]  Is it underhand? How did you know I was not doing it underhand?
[11213.80s -> 11226.71s]  All fantastic pets love to play ball fetch.
[11232.34s -> 11233.77s]  That is cute.
[11233.77s -> 11244.84s]  Ball fetch finished. Copy the gestures avatars performing to get your pet to do different things.
[11253.20s -> 11260.97s]  So now you've got to know your pet a little. I guess it's time I told you about trainer's headquarters.
[11262.15s -> 11269.15s]  Trainer's headquarters is an organization that looks after the fantastic pets of the world through their trainers, like you.
[11270.15s -> 11276.15s]  If you're wondering why you've never heard of trainer's headquarters, it's because they're ultra mega top secret.
[11277.15s -> 11283.15s]  The organization isn't interested in fame and glory, only finding and caring for fantastic pets.
[11283.15s -> 11288.15s]  Fantastic pet trainers have ten different ranks, and at the moment you're rank one.
[11289.15s -> 11294.15s]  That's the lowest rank I'm afraid. But don't worry, I'm sure you won't be there for long.
[11294.15s -> 11299.15s]  You can increase your trainer rank by taking part in talent shows with your pet.
[11299.15s -> 11302.15s]  I'll explain more about talent shows later.
[11311.21s -> 11317.25s]  Clap your arms to make your pet fly.
[11317.25s -> 11318.25s]  Fly Ember, fly.
[11322.73s -> 11323.73s]  You gonna fly?
[11325.23s -> 11326.23s]  Excuse me.
[11348.49s -> 11349.49s]  Chaos emerald.
[11352.18s -> 11353.18s]  You seeing this?
[11354.18s -> 11355.18s]  Look at that.
[11357.32s -> 11358.32s]  That's really interesting.
[11359.32s -> 11360.32s]  What do you think about that?
[11366.32s -> 11367.32s]  Come here.
[11368.32s -> 11369.32s]  Come here.
[11369.32s -> 11370.32s]  I'll throw my legs.
[11371.32s -> 11372.32s]  I'll throw my legs.
[11379.65s -> 11384.09s]  What's on the tee?
[11390.23s -> 11395.40s]  It's a fancy way of selecting all sorts of other options and things to do in the game.
[11395.40s -> 11402.40s]  Your smartphone is in the opposite corner of the display from the toy box, and you open it in exactly the same way.
[11402.40s -> 11406.40s]  Just hold your arms straight out to the top left and wait a second.
[11408.40s -> 11416.68s]  Get it.
[11417.68s -> 11424.80s]  As you know, your uncle, Dr. Minazu, is away on an expedition.
[11425.80s -> 11426.80s]  How is this a super game?
[11426.80s -> 11428.80s]  But did you know that you get to choose where he visits next?
[11429.80s -> 11432.58s]  Where should he go?
[11434.58s -> 11435.58s]  Las Vegas.
[11436.58s -> 11437.58s]  Right there, Las Vegas.
[11443.58s -> 11444.58s]  I'm just trying to see.
[11446.58s -> 11447.58s]  Russia?
[11449.58s -> 11450.58s]  Australia?
[11451.58s -> 11452.58s]  You guys choose.
[11454.58s -> 11455.58s]  You guys pick.
[11456.58s -> 11457.58s]  Smart click.
[11460.58s -> 11463.58s]  Then Dr. Minazuri across the world to that continent.
[11466.42s -> 11468.42s]  Whoa, you're getting a little too close.
[11469.42s -> 11470.42s]  Try taking a step back.
[11471.42s -> 11473.42s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, cancel.
[11476.64s -> 11481.53s]  Hold on.
[11481.53s -> 11482.53s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[11482.53s -> 11483.53s]  I need to get on here.
[11483.53s -> 11484.53s]  I'm afraid you're a little too close.
[11485.53s -> 11486.53s]  Try moving back.
[11486.53s -> 11487.53s]  All right.
[11487.53s -> 11488.53s]  Where are we going?
[11488.53s -> 11489.53s]  Ready?
[11489.53s -> 11501.19s]  Where?
[11501.19s -> 11502.19s]  All right.
[11502.19s -> 11503.19s]  It looks like we're going to.
[11507.44s -> 11514.00s]  Oh, you want me to go to the, you want me to go to the frost area.
[11514.00s -> 11515.00s]  Frost?
[11515.00s -> 11517.00s]  This looks like it's frost to me.
[11518.00s -> 11519.00s]  Yeah, that's unanimous.
[11520.00s -> 11521.00s]  Thanks for clicking.
[11521.00s -> 11522.00s]  Forward.
[11522.00s -> 11523.00s]  Whoa.
[11523.00s -> 11524.00s]  You're getting a little too close.
[11525.00s -> 11526.00s]  Try taking a step back.
[11527.00s -> 11528.00s]  All right.
[11528.00s -> 11556.49s]  How do we go there?
[11556.49s -> 11558.12s]  What are we going to get?
[11558.12s -> 11560.12s]  Lost lizard of Antarctica.
[11560.12s -> 11561.12s]  Unlock with gems.
[11562.12s -> 11565.44s]  It's just another lizard though.
[11565.44s -> 11567.68s]  This is, I don't want, I don't want this.
[11568.68s -> 11585.20s]  Let it stay lost.
[11587.20s -> 11597.65s]  Yes, terrible.
[11597.65s -> 11598.65s]  Australian.
[11601.34s -> 11602.34s]  Horse.
[11603.34s -> 11604.34s]  Yeah.
[11604.34s -> 11611.20s]  Hello.
[11611.20s -> 11614.20s]  You'll be pleased to hear that my expedition is going well.
[11614.20s -> 11618.20s]  I've discovered a very strange and wondrous new species of fantastic animals.
[11618.20s -> 11620.20s]  None of which have ever been seen before.
[11620.20s -> 11626.20s]  Although, between you and me, I'm beginning to suspect that one of them is just a pony in a funny hat.
[11626.20s -> 11632.00s]  Thank you Bitslave for the 10 community subs.
[11632.00s -> 11633.00s]  I already said that.
[11633.00s -> 11634.00s]  I'm so stupid.
[11634.00s -> 11635.00s]  Try moving back.
[11636.00s -> 11637.00s]  But thank you though for it.
[11638.88s -> 11639.88s]  All right, so did I get that?
[11639.88s -> 11640.88s]  Okay, let's go.
[11640.88s -> 11641.88s]  The database awaits.
[11641.88s -> 11643.88s]  We're going to Australia.
[11645.24s -> 11647.24s]  Does that mean we're still going to be in my room?
[11648.24s -> 11663.48s]  Welcome to the pet database.
[11664.48s -> 11667.48s]  This is where you get to decide how your pet evolves and changes.
[11668.48s -> 11674.48s]  You can choose its size and color, whether it has wings or horns, and loads of other things.
[11675.48s -> 11679.91s]  Everything your pet uses up a few gems to start the pet database.
[11679.91s -> 11683.91s]  But once you're inside the database, you can make as many changes as you like.
[11683.91s -> 11684.91s]  Horns.
[11684.91s -> 11686.91s]  There are lots of different parts of your pet that you can change.
[11688.91s -> 11689.91s]  Red eyes.
[11690.91s -> 11691.91s]  Claws.
[11691.91s -> 11698.91s]  If you choose this, then all the changes you've made to your pet will be undone, and they won't look any different.
[11698.91s -> 11701.91s]  Choose this when you're happy with the changes you've made.
[11702.91s -> 11704.40s]  All right.
[11704.40s -> 11705.90s]  Let's do horns.
[11706.90s -> 11712.97s]  If you choose a pet with horns, it will be more confident and proud than one without.
[11712.97s -> 11714.97s]  Okay, I don't like one.
[11714.97s -> 11716.97s]  I don't even know what these look like.
[11717.97s -> 11728.68s]  Uh, no.
[11728.68s -> 11732.01s]  Those are just little leaves.
[11732.01s -> 11735.92s]  Those are devil horns.
[11735.92s -> 11744.32s]  No.
[11746.27s -> 11750.45s]  Actually, I don't hate those.
[11750.45s -> 11751.45s]  I don't hate those.
[11751.45s -> 11752.45s]  All right.
[11752.45s -> 11753.45s]  No, I don't hate them.
[11753.45s -> 11759.17s]  Wings.
[11759.17s -> 11762.82s]  Does your pet have a pair of wings?
[11762.82s -> 11763.82s]  Yes.
[11763.82s -> 11767.82s]  Wings make pets more carefree, and of course, they will be able to fly.
[11768.82s -> 11770.82s]  Those are like two can wings.
[11772.82s -> 11776.17s]  Those are bats.
[11777.17s -> 11779.67s]  I should have made Spyro the dragon.
[11780.67s -> 11782.67s]  Why did I not make Spyro?
[11782.67s -> 11792.72s]  All right, we're going to go with bat wings.
[11792.72s -> 11799.88s]  Yeah, that's cool.
[11799.88s -> 11807.12s]  Let's do the skin, the coat.
[11808.12s -> 11811.12s]  Fantastic pets can be found all over the world.
[11811.12s -> 11812.12s]  I can make Spyro.
[11812.12s -> 11815.12s]  They have a huge range of skin types, textures, and patterns.
[11816.12s -> 11817.12s]  What does Spyro look like?
[11817.12s -> 11818.12s]  He's purple.
[11825.82s -> 11826.82s]  Purple and orange, right?
[11827.82s -> 11828.82s]  Are his legs orange?
[11841.20s -> 11842.20s]  Purple and yellow.
[11842.20s -> 11843.20s]  Purple and yellow.
[11843.20s -> 11844.95s]  Your tooth place.
[11845.95s -> 11847.95s]  Are his feet orange?
[11850.02s -> 11851.02s]  I don't think so.
[11855.84s -> 11859.96s]  All right.
[11859.96s -> 11860.96s]  Very cool.
[11860.96s -> 11861.96s]  Let's do color.
[11861.96s -> 11870.05s]  Is this purple?
[11874.30s -> 11875.30s]  All right, nice.
[11875.30s -> 11876.30s]  That's Spyro the dragon.
[11876.30s -> 11879.31s]  Well, it's got to be a little lighter.
[11880.31s -> 11883.53s]  There it is.
[11883.53s -> 11892.13s]  There it is.
[11892.13s -> 11912.44s]  Okay, what else can we do?
[11913.44s -> 11915.96s]  This is pattern.
[11916.96s -> 11918.91s]  This is my favorite part.
[11919.91s -> 11921.91s]  You can choose the pet's colors and patterns,
[11921.91s -> 11924.91s]  and they will appear on whichever skin type you just picked.
[11925.91s -> 11926.91s]  It's just smooth, right?
[11927.91s -> 11928.91s]  Does it do anything?
[11935.52s -> 11949.37s]  That looks good.
[11949.37s -> 11953.68s]  Oh, yes.
[11953.68s -> 11954.68s]  Very stylish.
[11955.68s -> 11956.68s]  All right, color.
[11956.68s -> 11957.68s]  This is where we get it.
[11957.68s -> 11958.68s]  It's orange, right?
[11958.68s -> 11959.68s]  No, that's correct.
[11959.68s -> 11965.15s]  Eyes.
[11965.15s -> 11966.15s]  What does Spyro have for eyes?
[11966.15s -> 11967.15s]  Okay.
[11967.15s -> 11969.15s]  This is where you specify the pet's eyes.
[11969.15s -> 11970.15s]  Red.
[11970.15s -> 11972.15s]  Do you want them to be adorable or intense?
[11973.15s -> 11975.15s]  Awesome or just plain strange?
[11979.18s -> 11980.18s]  The yellow?
[11980.18s -> 11982.00s]  You're too close.
[11985.28s -> 11990.30s]  All right.
[11990.30s -> 11991.30s]  Oh, yes.
[11991.30s -> 11992.30s]  Very stylish.
[11994.56s -> 11995.56s]  Now what?
[11995.56s -> 11996.74s]  What is that?
[11998.24s -> 11999.24s]  A tail.
[11999.24s -> 12000.24s]  What's the emo?
[12000.24s -> 12003.24s]  Change the color of your pet's tail for a new look.
[12003.24s -> 12005.41s]  No, orange is too darn.
[12013.37s -> 12016.37s]  This is where you can change the color of your pet's feet.
[12016.37s -> 12017.37s]  That's fine.
[12021.88s -> 12022.88s]  Very cool.
[12022.88s -> 12025.14s]  Wildness.
[12026.14s -> 12029.14s]  Now you can choose whether your pet is cute and cuddly,
[12029.14s -> 12031.14s]  or wild and fierce.
[12031.14s -> 12033.14s]  Definitely wild.
[12033.14s -> 12035.08s]  No!
[12035.08s -> 12036.08s]  Wait, actually, that looks more like...
[12036.08s -> 12037.08s]  That does look more like...
[12037.08s -> 12039.08s]  No, that looks like...
[12040.08s -> 12047.19s]  That's more of Spyro.
[12050.99s -> 12052.99s]  Yeah, that's Spyro right there.
[12052.99s -> 12053.99s]  The cute one.
[12062.84s -> 12064.85s]  Build.
[12064.85s -> 12066.85s]  This is where you choose your pet's build.
[12066.85s -> 12068.85s]  Is it sleek or stocky?
[12074.32s -> 12075.32s]  How many can I do?
[12076.32s -> 12087.00s]  I think that's as big as I can make Spyro.
[12088.00s -> 12094.11s]  Very cool.
[12095.11s -> 12096.35s]  All right.
[12096.35s -> 12097.35s]  And now fantastic pet.
[12102.17s -> 12105.08s]  Earth?
[12105.08s -> 12106.08s]  You think I'm a cyborg?
[12113.37s -> 12114.37s]  Robot.
[12114.37s -> 12115.37s]  All right.
[12116.68s -> 12117.68s]  Okay.
[12117.68s -> 12119.43s]  Looking good.
[12120.43s -> 12125.36s]  I'm afraid you're a little too close.
[12126.36s -> 12132.59s]  I think it looks cute.
[12132.59s -> 12135.21s]  It's a cool little Spyro...
[12136.21s -> 12138.71s]  Ember the Spyro the Dragon.
[12142.10s -> 12145.04s]  Copy what you see Avatar doing,
[12145.04s -> 12147.04s]  and your pet will do something cool.
[12148.04s -> 12154.79s]  Run away?
[12154.79s -> 12155.79s]  That's cool.
[12155.79s -> 12157.16s]  That's really cool.
[12157.16s -> 12160.16s]  You can listen to the emails you've received again later
[12160.16s -> 12162.16s]  by using the smartphone.
[12162.16s -> 12164.40s]  My systems include a camera,
[12164.40s -> 12167.40s]  so I can take photographs of any special moments
[12167.40s -> 12168.40s]  and save them for later.
[12168.40s -> 12169.40s]  I need to get photos.
[12169.40s -> 12171.40s]  Or until you decide to delete them.
[12172.40s -> 12175.40s]  You can swap between your pets using the smartphone.
[12176.40s -> 12179.40s]  This is a display of every award you've earned during the game.
[12179.40s -> 12180.40s]  Pet it.
[12180.40s -> 12181.40s]  I will.
[12181.40s -> 12183.40s]  Why not check out the encyclopedia?
[12183.40s -> 12185.40s]  You can get to it from your smartphone,
[12185.40s -> 12188.40s]  and it's full of interesting facts about pets.
[12193.22s -> 12194.22s]  She's right here.
[12194.22s -> 12195.22s]  You're getting a little too...
[12195.22s -> 12197.22s]  Ah, now this is interesting.
[12197.22s -> 12199.22s]  All pets have certain things they want.
[12200.22s -> 12202.22s]  You know, things like food to eat,
[12202.22s -> 12203.22s]  toys to play with,
[12203.22s -> 12205.22s]  or needing to sleep.
[12205.22s -> 12208.22s]  This is what you'll see when a pet wants something.
[12209.22s -> 12210.22s]  Just select that one.
[12210.22s -> 12211.22s]  She just frosted her eyes.
[12212.22s -> 12216.60s]  Perfect.
[12217.60s -> 12220.03s]  Time to give your pet a wash.
[12220.03s -> 12222.03s]  To ensure your pet is squeaky clean,
[12222.03s -> 12225.03s]  we'll move through several steps in order.
[12225.03s -> 12227.03s]  I'll help with each step.
[12227.03s -> 12229.03s]  Shower spray.
[12229.03s -> 12231.03s]  This is what you'll see when a pet wants something.
[12232.03s -> 12234.03s]  Just select that thought.
[12240.94s -> 12241.94s]  Getting nice and clean.
[12242.94s -> 12254.16s]  Pet soap.
[12254.16s -> 12256.16s]  Next is a special pet soap.
[12256.16s -> 12259.16s]  Rub it vigorously to get lots of bubbles.
[12260.16s -> 12263.77s]  Not in the eyes, but...
[12271.35s -> 12272.35s]  Sponge time.
[12272.35s -> 12275.35s]  Now rub the sponge nice and fast to get the pet clean.
[12276.35s -> 12295.38s]  Time to rinse.
[12295.38s -> 12298.38s]  Time to use the shower to wash all the soap away.
[12299.38s -> 12301.38s]  Make sure you don't miss any parts of your pet.
[12319.74s -> 12320.98s]  Hair dryer.
[12320.98s -> 12323.98s]  Finally, blow dry your pet with the hair dryer.
[12323.98s -> 12327.98s]  Be sure to move it around so you get all the dirt in the hose.
[12341.06s -> 12352.48s]  Pet clean.
[12353.48s -> 12355.48s]  Copy the gestures Avatar is performing
[12355.48s -> 12357.48s]  to get your pet to do different things.
[12363.62s -> 12367.37s]  Don't forget that a second player can join in the game
[12367.37s -> 12368.37s]  and you can play with your pet together.
[12370.37s -> 12373.37s]  When two of you are playing, you can both have fun with the pet.
[12374.37s -> 12376.37s]  Plus, some of the play activities support two players,
[12376.37s -> 12378.37s]  so try them out.
[12379.37s -> 12384.66s]  Hi, this is Germa985 and you're watching Germa985
[12384.66s -> 12385.66s]  on the Disney Channel.
[12385.66s -> 12386.66s]  Try all sorts of different gestures
[12386.66s -> 12388.66s]  and see which one your pet responds to.
[12389.66s -> 12390.66s]  I lost my powers.
[12398.33s -> 12402.47s]  Okay, time for your first talent show I think.
[12403.47s -> 12404.77s]  What's a talent show?
[12405.77s -> 12407.77s]  Well, Trainers Headquarters doesn't just find
[12407.77s -> 12409.77s]  and look after their fantastic pets.
[12410.77s -> 12412.77s]  They run the talent shows too.
[12416.76s -> 12417.76s]  Oh, come on.
[12425.98s -> 12427.98s]  A chance for the best trainers and their pets
[12427.98s -> 12429.98s]  to show off their skills to the world.
[12430.98s -> 12431.98s]  You're gonna do great.
[12431.98s -> 12433.98s]  Only one thing, you're too close.
[12433.98s -> 12434.98s]  Mom, is that your...
[12434.98s -> 12436.98s]  Mom, is that your two-year-old?
[12436.98s -> 12437.98s]  ...more important than others.
[12437.98s -> 12440.98s]  You can score more points at the big shows,
[12440.98s -> 12443.98s]  but I'm afraid the competition will be tougher.
[12443.98s -> 12445.98s]  If you and your pet do well in an event,
[12445.98s -> 12447.98s]  you might win a bronze rosette.
[12448.98s -> 12449.98s]  If you do really well,
[12449.98s -> 12451.98s]  you might get a silver rosette.
[12452.98s -> 12454.98s]  Wait, silver's better than bronze, right?
[12455.98s -> 12456.98s]  Yes, of course.
[12456.98s -> 12457.98s]  I knew that.
[12458.98s -> 12460.98s]  Finally, if you do extremely well in an event,
[12460.98s -> 12462.98s]  you might win a gold rosette.
[12463.98s -> 12464.98s]  They're the best you can get,
[12464.98s -> 12466.98s]  but you have to work hard.
[12466.98s -> 12468.98s]  I'm afraid you're a little too close.
[12469.98s -> 12470.98s]  Try moving back.
[12471.98s -> 12473.16s]  The points that you earn in talent shows
[12473.16s -> 12475.16s]  are added to your trainer rank,
[12475.16s -> 12478.16s]  so they're absolutely still worth entering,
[12478.16s -> 12479.16s]  even if you don't win.
[12480.16s -> 12482.16s]  Don't worry if you don't do so well in an event.
[12482.16s -> 12484.16s]  You can always practice some more,
[12484.16s -> 12485.16s]  so you can do better in an event.
[12485.16s -> 12486.16s]  I'm trying to get them.
[12487.16s -> 12490.33s]  Remember, talent shows are about having fun with your pet.
[12490.33s -> 12491.33s]  There's cameras everywhere!
[12492.33s -> 12493.33s]  There's cameras in my walls!
[12494.33s -> 12512.00s]  What about the bubble bubbler?
[12513.00s -> 12520.64s]  The bubble bubbler.
[12521.64s -> 12524.64s]  Play with bubbles by popping and swirling them around.
[12524.64s -> 12527.60s]  Three.
[12527.60s -> 12528.60s]  Two.
[12528.60s -> 12529.60s]  One.
[12533.08s -> 12534.08s]  The faster you move around,
[12534.08s -> 12537.26s]  the more bubbles the bubble bubbler creates.
[12538.26s -> 12546.22s]  It's good!
[12546.22s -> 12547.22s]  You're improving!
[12550.22s -> 12554.44s]  The faster you move around,
[12554.44s -> 12557.44s]  the more bubbles the bubble bubbler creates.
[12560.54s -> 12561.54s]  What a talent show!
[12561.54s -> 12562.54s]  For me!
[12562.54s -> 12564.54s]  Yeah, burst those bubbles!
[12564.54s -> 12568.98s]  Come on, get one!
[12568.98s -> 12569.98s]  Get one!
[12569.98s -> 12570.98s]  Get one!
[12570.98s -> 12594.24s]  Strike a pose.
[12595.24s -> 12596.24s]  Pose struck.
[12596.24s -> 12597.24s]  Of gold?
[12598.24s -> 12599.24s]  I'm impressed.
[12599.24s -> 12600.24s]  Keep going.
[12601.24s -> 12603.05s]  Ball fetch.
[12604.05s -> 12619.12s]  Right.
[12619.12s -> 12620.12s]  I'm impressed.
[12620.12s -> 12623.12s]  Time to give your pet some exercise with a game of ball fetch.
[12623.12s -> 12625.12s]  No, but this one sucks.
[12629.75s -> 12630.75s]  Reach.
[12630.75s -> 12632.75s]  Try throwing the ball into the screen.
[12636.10s -> 12639.10s]  The markers on the floor display how far your last throw
[12639.10s -> 12641.10s]  and your longest throw went before the ball bounced.
[12642.10s -> 12644.10s]  Whoa, you're getting a little too close.
[12644.10s -> 12646.10s]  Try taking a step back.
[12677.52s -> 12679.52s]  Just kind of what happens in
[12679.52s -> 12681.52s]  just like fetch with a dog for long enough
[12681.52s -> 12683.52s]  and they're still so enthusiastic about it,
[12683.52s -> 12686.52s]  but you aren't having the 50th time.
[12687.52s -> 12692.99s]  Try, Link.
[12692.99s -> 12696.12s]  It looks like your pet is enjoying this.
[12696.12s -> 12698.12s]  You're like, ah, I'm kind of done.
[12699.12s -> 12700.49s]  Are you?
[12700.49s -> 12701.49s]  Are you?
[12701.49s -> 12703.49s]  That's enough ball fetch for now.
[12714.97s -> 12715.97s]  I'm afraid.
[12715.97s -> 12716.97s]  Strike a pose.
[12716.97s -> 12717.97s]  Finish.
[12718.97s -> 12719.97s]  You're on the way up.
[12719.97s -> 12720.97s]  Keep going.
[12721.97s -> 12722.97s]  I'm so good at this game.
[12722.97s -> 12723.97s]  It's just ridiculous.
[12723.97s -> 12724.97s]  Pinata.
[12730.18s -> 12731.18s]  What do you risk it?
[12731.18s -> 12732.18s]  Sandy scaly ruffles.
[12732.18s -> 12734.18s]  You're all done.
[12735.80s -> 12736.80s]  Pinata.
[12737.80s -> 12739.80s]  Time to give your pet those tasty treats
[12739.80s -> 12741.80s]  by pounding the paper pinata.
[12741.80s -> 12742.80s]  Four.
[12742.80s -> 12743.80s]  Three.
[12743.80s -> 12744.80s]  Two.
[12744.80s -> 12745.80s]  One.
[12745.80s -> 12746.80s]  Go.
[12746.80s -> 12763.45s]  Bring on.
[12763.45s -> 12765.45s]  Be careful you don't swing too hard
[12765.45s -> 12767.45s]  and pinata smash.
[12775.22s -> 12782.60s]  You're improving.
[12782.60s -> 12783.60s]  Bring on the neck.
[12783.60s -> 12785.42s]  Yes.
[12785.42s -> 12786.42s]  Good work.
[12786.42s -> 12797.52s]  Yes.
[12797.52s -> 12825.06s]  Take the picture.
[12826.06s -> 12831.84s]  Strike a pose.
[12831.84s -> 12832.84s]  Finish.
[12833.84s -> 12834.84s]  What silver.
[12834.84s -> 12835.84s]  It's supposed to be a breast game.
[12835.84s -> 12836.84s]  Nice work.
[12836.84s -> 12837.84s]  Keep going.
[12837.84s -> 12839.92s]  Brush time.
[12839.92s -> 12840.92s]  I know.
[12840.92s -> 12841.92s]  Wait.
[12841.92s -> 12843.28s]  Whoa.
[12843.28s -> 12844.28s]  You're getting a little too close.
[12845.28s -> 12846.28s]  Try taking a step back.
[12847.28s -> 12852.00s]  All pets need to be brushed from time to time.
[12852.00s -> 12856.00s]  Move your brush along your pet in nice, smooth movements.
[12856.00s -> 12858.00s]  I'm afraid you're a little too close.
[12859.00s -> 12860.00s]  Try moving back.
[12861.00s -> 12870.49s]  Perfect brushing speed.
[12874.14s -> 12878.07s]  That's it.
[12878.07s -> 12880.07s]  Perfect brushing speed.
[12881.07s -> 12894.19s]  You're brushing too quickly.
[12901.32s -> 12902.81s]  There you go.
[12902.81s -> 12904.81s]  One perfectly brushed pet.
[12907.44s -> 12909.76s]  A gem.
[12910.76s -> 12921.35s]  Strike a pose.
[12921.35s -> 12922.35s]  Finished.
[12923.35s -> 12926.35s]  What I always thought silver was much classier than gold.
[12927.35s -> 12929.55s]  Power pounce.
[12929.55s -> 12930.55s]  Next.
[12931.55s -> 12932.55s]  Not yet.
[12932.55s -> 12933.55s]  Not yet.
[12941.00s -> 12943.00s]  Help your pet run as fast as it can.
[12943.00s -> 12946.00s]  Then tell it when to jump for maximum score.
[12947.00s -> 12951.12s]  Three.
[12951.12s -> 12952.12s]  Two.
[12952.12s -> 12953.12s]  How do I do that?
[12953.12s -> 12954.12s]  One.
[12954.12s -> 12955.12s]  Start running.
[12955.12s -> 12963.46s]  Jump.
[12963.46s -> 12964.46s]  Wow.
[12964.46s -> 12969.41s]  You're fast.
[12969.41s -> 12970.41s]  Jump.
[12970.41s -> 12971.41s]  Jump.
[12971.41s -> 12972.41s]  Crouch.
[12972.41s -> 12974.87s]  Jump.
[12974.87s -> 12975.87s]  Holy shit.
[12975.87s -> 12979.16s]  That was the low score you get.
[12979.16s -> 12980.16s]  Second jump.
[12980.16s -> 12981.16s]  Three.
[12981.16s -> 12982.16s]  Two.
[12982.16s -> 12983.59s]  One.
[12983.59s -> 12984.59s]  Start running.
[12984.59s -> 12989.92s]  Keep going.
[12989.92s -> 12995.90s]  Keep going.
[12995.90s -> 12996.90s]  Crouch down.
[12996.90s -> 12997.90s]  Jump.
[12998.90s -> 13000.91s]  Yes.
[13000.91s -> 13005.80s]  Three.
[13005.80s -> 13006.80s]  Two.
[13006.80s -> 13007.80s]  One.
[13007.80s -> 13009.48s]  Start running.
[13009.48s -> 13015.33s]  That's it.
[13015.33s -> 13016.33s]  Keep going.
[13022.24s -> 13023.24s]  Crouch down.
[13023.24s -> 13024.24s]  Jump.
[13025.24s -> 13028.21s]  Power pounce.
[13028.21s -> 13029.21s]  Finished.
[13030.39s -> 13032.39s]  Part of my body that I can't talk about.
[13032.39s -> 13036.88s]  I went up and down too hard and it's like, you know what I'm saying?
[13042.80s -> 13047.12s]  It's like, that fucking hurt.
[13073.24s -> 13075.24s]  Are you going to be beyond sore tomorrow?
[13075.24s -> 13077.24s]  I was really sore this morning.
[13077.24s -> 13078.55s]  After yesterday.
[13078.55s -> 13080.55s]  Six hours of this?
[13081.55s -> 13083.55s]  You better believe it.
[13084.55s -> 13087.55s]  Because we toddler walking up the stairs.
[13094.36s -> 13095.36s]  It's good for me though.
[13095.36s -> 13096.98s]  It's good for me.
[13106.21s -> 13107.21s]  All right.
[13107.21s -> 13109.21s]  We are at the 30 minute mark for this one.
[13110.21s -> 13114.21s]  I think it's time to stick around for like another 20 minutes.
[13142.32s -> 13144.32s]  Dig in my floor?
[13144.32s -> 13146.50s]  What are you talking about?
[13155.00s -> 13163.45s]  Don't dig that up.
[13167.45s -> 13169.45s]  Go dig over here.
[13171.45s -> 13173.27s]  Dig.
[13174.27s -> 13177.11s]  Right there.
[13182.67s -> 13183.67s]  Dig.
[13184.67s -> 13185.67s]  Okay.
[13185.67s -> 13187.67s]  Shutting down tutorial systems.
[13187.67s -> 13189.67s]  Enjoy the game.
[13189.67s -> 13197.44s]  Dig.
[13197.44s -> 13198.44s]  That's it.
[13198.44s -> 13204.35s]  Good.
[13204.35s -> 13206.16s]  Sit.
[13206.16s -> 13218.73s]  Sit.
[13218.73s -> 13237.29s]  Time for some exercise.
[13237.29s -> 13238.29s]  Done.
[13238.29s -> 13241.94s]  Be careful you don't trip over anything.
[13252.14s -> 13253.14s]  That was fun.
[13253.14s -> 13260.08s]  Okay.
[13260.08s -> 13261.08s]  That's it.
[13261.08s -> 13262.08s]  Good.
[13263.08s -> 13265.08s]  Let's have a second player.
[13265.08s -> 13267.08s]  Please wave at the screen to begin.
[13270.72s -> 13272.72s]  Starting two player play.
[13272.72s -> 13275.44s]  Whoa.
[13275.44s -> 13277.44s]  You're getting a little too close.
[13277.44s -> 13279.44s]  What do I do now?
[13291.36s -> 13293.36s]  Be careful you don't trip over anything.
[13297.37s -> 13311.84s]  You're getting a little too close.
[13311.84s -> 13312.84s]  Try taking a step back.
[13312.84s -> 13313.84s]  Sit.
[13315.33s -> 13316.33s]  Sit.
[13316.33s -> 13318.98s]  Good.
[13318.98s -> 13320.28s]  All right.
[13322.36s -> 13326.64s]  Time for some exercise.
[13328.40s -> 13329.40s]  What?
[13329.40s -> 13330.40s]  Exercise?
[13331.40s -> 13352.05s]  Organization options ready to use.
[13357.56s -> 13358.56s]  Set.
[13359.56s -> 13361.95s]  Jump.
[13363.96s -> 13364.96s]  Chase time.
[13364.96s -> 13366.96s]  Returning to single player control.
[13370.84s -> 13371.84s]  Starting co-op play.
[13371.84s -> 13373.84s]  Please wave at the screen to begin.
[13375.84s -> 13388.51s]  That was a fantastic cut.
[13388.51s -> 13398.90s]  Oh, boy.
[13398.90s -> 13399.90s]  You can't even see me.
[13399.90s -> 13403.83s]  Finally.
[13403.83s -> 13405.64s]  All right.
[13407.59s -> 13409.59s]  There's so many good ones that are still here.
[13412.53s -> 13417.36s]  I don't know.
[13417.36s -> 13419.36s]  There's so many that are so good.
[13419.36s -> 13421.49s]  What time is it?
[13421.49s -> 13423.49s]  It's been about four hours.
[13423.49s -> 13424.49s]  All right.
[13424.49s -> 13427.49s]  I feel like I want to give that one all day.
[13428.49s -> 13433.80s]  I've got too many of these.
[13434.80s -> 13440.14s]  All right.
[13440.14s -> 13450.85s]  This is going to be a good one.
[13450.85s -> 13460.86s]  The price is right.
[13460.86s -> 13471.42s]  This is going to be a good one.
[13471.42s -> 13476.76s]  That's not the horror one.
[13476.76s -> 13479.76s]  I know, but I think that's a full game.
[13479.76s -> 13484.83s]  I think that Rise of Nightmares is a full experience.
[13484.83s -> 13486.83s]  I think I want to give that one.
[13486.83s -> 13487.83s]  I don't know.
[13487.83s -> 13508.12s]  That didn't sound good.
[13508.12s -> 13512.81s]  Uh-oh.
[13517.98s -> 13519.98s]  I think it's all right.
[13519.98s -> 13521.41s]  Hey, the shuts us off.
[13521.41s -> 13522.41s]  It shuts us off.
[13522.41s -> 13523.41s]  We're not done.
[13523.41s -> 13524.78s]  Price is right.
[13524.78s -> 13525.78s]  Connect.
[13527.08s -> 13540.16s]  No.
[13540.16s -> 13561.18s]  Where's the connect?
[13561.18s -> 13564.12s]  Connect party.
[13564.12s -> 13570.44s]  You'll have to exit the game if you don't have a sensor.
[13570.44s -> 13572.93s]  What do you mean the connect party game?
[13572.93s -> 13589.53s]  Let's go.
[13589.53s -> 13593.31s]  What do you mean party?
[13593.31s -> 13598.62s]  What is that bullshit?
[13598.62s -> 13601.62s]  Is this just tacked on horseshit connect mode?
[13601.62s -> 13618.07s]  The price is right.
[13618.07s -> 13626.86s]  They picked me.
[13626.86s -> 13627.86s]  I can't believe it.
[13627.86s -> 13631.02s]  Hey, Bob.
[13631.02s -> 13636.48s]  Pool table.
[13636.48s -> 13640.36s]  The entire family can have our fabulous pool table.
[13640.36s -> 13641.36s]  That's like two grand.
[13641.36s -> 13644.36s]  It's finished in light English oak and comes with an accessory
[13644.36s -> 13645.36s]  package.
[13645.36s -> 13646.36s]  2200.
[13646.36s -> 13652.01s]  Let's start the bidding.
[13652.01s -> 13656.99s]  2200.
[13656.99s -> 13657.99s]  2200.
[13657.99s -> 13672.62s]  I thought that's what they did.
[13672.62s -> 13677.25s]  What?
[13677.25s -> 13678.25s]  That's dumb.
[13678.25s -> 13682.35s]  You only get one choice.
[13682.35s -> 13683.35s]  It's me.
[13683.35s -> 13684.59s]  2195.
[13684.59s -> 13685.59s]  It's 2195.
[13685.59s -> 13687.53s]  That's 2200 bucks.
[13687.53s -> 13688.53s]  Eggs, Bob.
[13688.53s -> 13689.53s]  2695.
[13689.53s -> 13690.53s]  Now let's play my...
[13690.53s -> 13698.17s]  Is that the Xbox?
[13698.17s -> 13704.72s]  I thought that was a construction work or something.
[13704.72s -> 13705.72s]  Okay.
[13705.72s -> 13708.37s]  Basis and glassware.
[13708.37s -> 13709.37s]  Shelves.
[13709.37s -> 13711.96s]  Bed.
[13711.96s -> 13712.96s]  Bed.
[13712.96s -> 13716.12s]  Bed.
[13716.12s -> 13717.12s]  Bed.
[13717.12s -> 13718.12s]  Bed.
[13718.12s -> 13719.12s]  Bed.
[13719.12s -> 13720.12s]  Bed.
[13720.12s -> 13721.12s]  Bed.
[13721.12s -> 13722.12s]  Bed.
[13722.12s -> 13724.89s]  Bed.
[13724.89s -> 13725.89s]  Bed.
[13725.89s -> 13727.32s]  Bed.
[13727.32s -> 13728.32s]  Bed.
[13728.32s -> 13729.32s]  Bed.
[13729.32s -> 13730.95s]  Bed.
[13730.95s -> 13731.95s]  Bed.
[13731.95s -> 13732.95s]  Bed.
[13732.95s -> 13733.95s]  Bed.
[13733.95s -> 13734.95s]  Bed.
[13734.95s -> 13735.95s]  Bed.
[13735.95s -> 13736.95s]  Bed.
[13736.95s -> 13737.95s]  Bed.
[13737.95s -> 13738.95s]  Bed.
[13738.95s -> 13739.95s]  Bed.
[13739.95s -> 13740.95s] kelvin.
[13740.95s -> 13741.95s]  No.
[13741.95s -> 13742.95s]  No.
[13742.95s -> 13743.95s]  Bed.
[13743.95s -> 13744.95s]  Bed.
[13744.95s -> 13745.95s]  Bed.
[13745.95s -> 13746.95s]  In between the two prices.
[13746.95s -> 13753.09s]  Alright, I'm going to say in between the two prices.
[13753.09s -> 13754.09s]  In between the two prices.
[13754.09s -> 13758.09s]  to enter a value which you believe is in between the two prices.
[13758.09s -> 13775.45s]  All right, I'm going to say in between the two prices, the shelves are probably like
[13775.45s -> 13783.67s]  three or four hundred. The bed is probably like six hundred, seven hundred. The shelves
[13783.67s -> 13793.48s]  are probably three hundred. I'm going to say five hundred bucks. The shelves are not more
[13793.48s -> 13809.71s]  than five hundred. Six hundred? Yeah, no, I'm going to say five fifty. Four seventy, five oh two.
[13830.35s -> 13842.88s]  What? A fucking queen size pillow top bed is three thousand dollars? Is it a bar of gold?
[13844.36s -> 13851.39s]  I have a king size bed in there right now. We can take up a lot of space. We might not be very big
[13851.39s -> 13856.84s]  people. That shit was not more than a thousand dollars. It was like eleven hundred bucks.
[13858.52s -> 13865.69s]  Two thousand four beds for fucking cars. I forgot. Continue. That shelf is like a fucking
[13865.69s -> 13883.82s]  bed of plastic. That's like two hundred bucks. Plastic shelf with like two glass vases on it.
[13883.82s -> 13885.02s]  I still got to go to the showcase?
[13925.93s -> 13942.00s]  Ninety five eighty five. I'm going to the showcase. I can't believe it. I'm constantly laughing.
[13950.67s -> 13954.91s]  Showcases up for bid. Got to nail this one. It's the closest to the actual retail price.
[13954.91s -> 13960.83s]  Without going over, wins their showcase. If your bid is within two hundred and fifty dollars of
[13960.83s -> 13966.19s]  the actual retail price of your showcase, you win both showcases. Can you make him dab? Let's see
[13966.19s -> 13974.72s]  the first showcase. Our showcase begins with your very own copy of Star Wars. Star Wars. This new
[13974.72s -> 13985.00s]  VCR DVD player will force you to work out once you own a new home gym. A Star Wars DVD player
[13986.36s -> 13999.47s]  and a home gym. Let's see. That's probably five grand. Four grand. Five grand. More than that
[13999.47s -> 14007.55s]  maybe. And a car. 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee. That's probably seven. Eighteen thousand dollars.
[14007.55s -> 14014.12s]  Twenty thousand. Eighteen thousand. Eighteen five. Eighteen thousand five hundred dollars.
[14016.52s -> 14024.65s]  Twenty. Maybe twenty four thousand. Twenty four thousand. Plus five thousand to the gym. Twenty

[14066.51s -> 14072.43s]  Let's go to party mode. Your showcase begins with this fashionable new luggage.
[14072.43s -> 14081.92s]  For stylish luggage pieces which are as durable as they are beautiful. Go back to Power Rangers.
[14081.92s -> 14087.71s]  Wherever you go. Javiv by Boyd travel in luxury. And now it's time to pack those bags.
[14087.71s -> 14095.04s]  Luggage uh twenty two hundred bucks. Two thousand. Three thousand. To exciting Vancouver.
[14096.48s -> 14101.76s]  Vancouver. A Vancouver getaway. How long? A round trip coach from Los Angeles to Vancouver
[14101.76s -> 14112.08s]  British Columbia. How long? Six nights. Hotel. Three hundred bucks a night. And then Tokyo.
[14112.08s -> 14118.88s]  You're talking about three. Twelve. Twenty. Plus Tokyo. This is way cooler. Stop. What the fuck?
[14119.84s -> 14128.92s]  Okay you've both bid on your showcases. Let's see what they're worth. The actual retail price
[14128.92s -> 14145.92s]  of the first showcase is. A difference of. A difference of. That's right. Your opponent's bid
[14145.92s -> 14153.66s]  is closest. This mode is terrible. I won't play the regular mode. I don't care. I've got to use
[14153.66s -> 14170.86s]  a controller. I'm doing it. The Kinect mode sucks. No. Get out. All right. Single player.
[14171.58s -> 14176.72s]  Welcome to the prices right. We need your help. Just pretend that I'm doing Kinect.
[14177.60s -> 14184.27s]  We found a box of unmarked tapes dating back to 1972 that we need your help identifying.
[14192.46s -> 14195.50s]  We've sent along the lovely Jessica to help you in your task. Good luck.
[14202.94s -> 14212.24s]  Yeah. Why are we playing old tapes from the 70s? Why wouldn't you just make a prices right game?
[14212.96s -> 14246.76s]  What is with all this nonsense? 1983. You're too close. Oh fuck. Sorry.
[14250.12s -> 14254.20s]  All right. Let's go. You look like that guy. You look like that second guy.
[14254.20s -> 14263.26s]  Okay. It's a trampoline. Trampoline. With a unique ground design for outdoor fun and recreation.
[14263.26s -> 14269.10s]  Ideal for physical fitness with features such as uniform and larger jumping area from round
[14269.10s -> 14278.06s]  trampoline. Let's start the bidding. What's your bid? Yeah. This is much better. All right. I'm
[14278.06s -> 14283.96s]  going to say five. I'm going to say. Please give me your bid. 699. I think it's. I'm going to say
[14284.60s -> 14328.59s]  699. They're like 700. No. 750. 799. 800. 799. First try by the way. The Plinko machine. Yeah.
[14329.71s -> 14335.80s]  This is a good one. This is probably the best one. All right. Let's go. First you need to earn
[14335.80s -> 14341.64s]  your Plinko chips. You start out with one free chip, but you can win up to four more Plinkos.
[14341.64s -> 14346.84s]  Four different items on display. Each item has a two number price, but only one of those numbers
[14346.84s -> 14354.36s]  is correct. Let's take a look at the first item. It's a queen size bed sack. It provides luxury.
[14354.36s -> 14359.16s]  Pillow case. That's inaccurate. Box springs and protection for youth from bed sack.
[14359.16s -> 14362.84s]  No. Wait a minute. Or the left number, the correct number in the price.
[14363.32s -> 14371.56s]  Wait a minute. Okay. So it's the left number. 39. It's probably 30. It's probably like 29.
[14372.36s -> 14382.38s]  It's the nine. You can earn another chip with this item. Be everything you can be with Mary Kay
[14382.38s -> 14386.30s]  Cosmetics. Skin care and glamour cosmetics presented in your home. Makeup is expensive.
[14388.52s -> 14394.84s]  Is the right or the left number. No product has. It's either 79 or it's 84.99. The left one is
[14394.84s -> 14413.85s]  correct. 71 fucking dollars. What is the right or the left number, the correct number in the price.
[14417.80s -> 14425.47s]  The five. A vacuum cleaner is like a hundred bucks. Here's another Plinko chip. This is your
[14425.47s -> 14430.99s]  last chance to earn a Plinko chip. 71? Stainless steel kitchenware. The choice of many fine
[14430.99s -> 14437.80s]  restaurants. Prepare, cook, and serve food in your home. Is the right or the left number,
[14437.80s -> 14442.92s]  the correct number in the price. Those are three. It's definitely the right number because
[14442.92s -> 14447.56s]  that's more expensive for sure. Here's another Plinko chip. I mean, it's cheaper. Those things,
[14447.56s -> 14454.28s]  dog shit they shittily made. The bad quality. Drop your chips. I'm just kidding. If that company
[14454.28s -> 14463.60s]  still exists 30 years later, I was making a joke. All right. I usually go all the way to the left.
[14476.36s -> 14512.12s]  Again, only the left. Only. This is your last chip. No zero. Congratulations. 1500 bucks. No zero.
[14513.69s -> 14516.25s]  You're not going for, if you drop it in the middle, you're going to get a zero.
[14517.37s -> 14522.49s]  Don't you guys know how to play these? If you go in the middle, this shit balls in the zeros
[14522.49s -> 14526.17s]  and you don't have anything. If your spin or your combination of two spins is higher,
[14526.17s -> 14532.81s]  that's enough money to go get yourself a shelf. Be careful though. If you go over one dollar,
[14532.81s -> 14538.33s]  you'll lose. If your total is exactly one dollar, you'll win one thousand dollars
[14538.33s -> 14545.85s]  and you'll spin again. You got 90. I lose. It's your turn to spin.
[14557.05s -> 14565.72s]  One dollar, one dollar, one 30 cents. Come on. All right. I give you 70. You have to spin the
[14565.72s -> 14579.24s]  wheel again. It's your turn to spin. 70, 60, 60.
[14591.44s -> 14598.68s]  Why would I look that happy? I wouldn't be that happy. I'd be very upset about that.
[14602.04s -> 14605.56s]  Well, at least you won. I mean, actually walking out of there with free grand.
[14606.70s -> 14609.82s]  You don't have access to the archives. You can access them from the single player menu.
[14609.82s -> 14632.78s]  New show unlocked. This is fucking stupid. Why would you count? Why can't we just play
[14634.22s -> 14637.90s]  defensive right in the gear that it currently is? Is it really that big of a deal?
[14639.74s -> 14643.69s]  We have to go different gears every game?
[14652.57s -> 14661.42s]  There we go. 2005, the future.
[14663.34s -> 14667.18s]  No, I got to get this. I'm going to nail this. You guys in my audience, you got to help me.
[14667.26s -> 14667.90s]  You have to help me.
[14675.90s -> 14680.17s]  Well, here it comes. A beautiful new area rug. I thought that was a board game.
[14681.82s -> 14682.62s]  Area rug.
[14689.44s -> 14695.76s]  Not expensive at all. Like 50 bucks? 100, 125.
[14695.76s -> 14709.71s]  What? 110? What year is it? $1,000 for an area rug.
[14713.18s -> 14728.46s]  No way. No way. 2005. Nice area rug. 400. I'm going to say 400.
[14728.46s -> 14747.80s]  $4,400. $1,000. You can get a rug like that for 40 bucks.
[14756.64s -> 14761.52s]  Ooh, a stove. $750.
[14762.00s -> 14765.28s]  And self-cleaning convection oven with three heavy duty oven racks.
[14767.24s -> 14774.76s]  A stainless steel stove is not five grand. $5,000. No, it's like, it's like 800.
[14779.08s -> 14785.52s]  They're not this expensive. No, it's cheaper, man. It's like, it's...
[14786.16s -> 14815.55s]  $5,000. I think it was fucking $1,300. $1,000.
[14819.85s -> 14824.09s]  All right, now these back in the 15 years ago or so, these were like $2,000.
[14825.61s -> 14835.05s]  $3,000 at least. It's probably like, it's probably like, it's probably like $7,000. $6,000.
[14840.24s -> 14851.32s]  Okay, please give me your bid. How much do you think it's worth? Your bid, please.
[14851.32s -> 14874.35s]  Was the first thing I said $2,000? I said like $2,000, $3,000 originally. It's $21,000.
[14874.35s -> 14881.48s]  It's going to be like, it's going to be like $21,500. Got it. Oh, right, it went over.
[14885.36s -> 14890.73s]  Let me just let you play until you get to go on stage. I've been here for five days.
[14891.37s -> 14900.81s]  Big selection of phone... Vtech. Three multi-phone systems from one phone app.
[14900.81s -> 14905.29s]  Set up digital mailboxes and staff telemarketing calls with a telezapper.
[14905.29s -> 14908.09s]  $60, $65. Vtech technology. You can clearly hear.
[14909.77s -> 14913.37s]  Let's start the bid. $69, like 70 bucks. All right, what's your bid?
[14913.37s -> 14924.57s]  $80. Okay, please give me your bid. How much do you think it's worth?
[14924.57s -> 14929.29s]  For a cordless landline in 2005? Five fucking hundred bucks?
[14930.25s -> 14951.28s]  Can you please not do that? It's got to get lucky.
[14961.69s -> 14974.28s]  $1,000 for a cordless landline. That was not that $1,000 fucking dollars. That can't be accurate.
[14980.25s -> 14983.77s]  More than what? Why would you have like 15 cordless phones in your house?
[14984.65s -> 14992.49s]  Is there one in your shower? 20 cordless phones in every fucking room?
[15001.98s -> 15012.32s]  A whole scuba set? An entire scuba diving set? I have no idea. I'm going to say $1,800.
[15012.32s -> 15029.80s]  I have absolutely no clue. $1,800. $1,700. Sorry, buddy. You were close, but you went over.
[15031.08s -> 15040.51s]  Good game time. That's when Bob Barker comes over and he goes,
[15040.51s -> 15046.19s]  Oh, hey, Jeremy. It seems like you've been here for a few days. Five days to be exact.
[15046.19s -> 15050.35s]  You keep showing up and getting in line. And I'm like, yeah, Bob. I really love the show.
[15051.31s -> 15055.47s]  The next prize's first digit is one of the two from the first item.
[15058.59s -> 15066.33s]  Uh, silver. Silver. 46 pieces.
[15071.13s -> 15079.21s]  I got a shirt that says like, Bob is so cool and sexy, right? Oh, I love Bob.
[15110.16s -> 15113.60s]  Get that guy out of here. I don't want to see him in line ever again.
[15114.24s -> 15120.08s]  You'll spin the wheel. If you're spin or your fucking weirdo is higher than the current leader,
[15120.08s -> 15125.36s]  you'll win the chance to play in the showcase. Be careful though. If you go over $1,
[15125.36s -> 15131.04s]  you'll get a shirt that said, I love Bob. And weirdly enough, he had these huge yellow
[15131.04s -> 15135.92s]  pit stains underneath his underarms. I don't think he's ever taken that shirt off.
[15136.32s -> 15158.43s]  Beat his score to win. It's your turn to spin. 65. Result is lower than the leader.
[15158.43s -> 15161.63s]  You have to spin the wheel again. It's your turn to spin.
[15162.67s -> 15174.68s]  I got it. I'm looking for low. Low, low, low, low, low. Come on. There it is. I'm in the showcase.
[15175.32s -> 15186.89s]  20. Oh, god damn. Yeah, Bob. I can't wait.
[15197.26s -> 15201.26s]  The player who bids the closest to the actual retail price without going over
[15201.26s -> 15208.46s]  wins their showcase. If your bid is within $250 of the actual retail price of your showcase,
[15208.46s -> 15212.54s]  you win both showcases. Let's see the first showcase.
[15213.10s -> 15222.49s]  Your showcase begins with a wonderful collection of cookbooks. Cookbooks can be pretty expensive.
[15222.49s -> 15227.53s]  Books to help you cook and entertain like a pro. Classic cuisines from around the world
[15227.53s -> 15231.93s]  with guides to find food and find wine. Back in 2005, you're talking about probably
[15231.93s -> 15237.45s]  two, 300 bucks for something like this. And you can serve it in this lovely new dining room.
[15237.61s -> 15238.81s]  Dining room. What kind of wood?
[15239.77s -> 15245.95s]  Furniture Saddle Creek collection. This nine-piece dining room group with ladderback chairs and
[15245.95s -> 15255.87s]  buffets. And serve your meal on this elegant dinnerware. This 24 karat gold accent dining

[15268.86s -> 15280.44s]  humans. I have a human complaint, okay? You could go get a 60-piece set of silverware
[15281.32s -> 15289.56s]  for probably $25 at Walmart. Why in a million years, even if you had a million dollars,
[15290.36s -> 15296.28s]  would you buy like a thousand dollar silverware that you're going to use? It's like, it's like
[15296.28s -> 15307.26s]  25 bucks. And nobody cares about that shit. Do you think anybody looks at your silverware
[15307.26s -> 15312.22s]  on your house? No. In fact, well, maybe they do, but they're probably, what they're looking for
[15312.22s -> 15316.78s]  is they're looking for like the dishwasher stains to rub off on their shirt. They don't care about
[15316.78s -> 15321.74s]  if it's gold or not. You know, like those like white spots and they're like, oh, shh. Can they
[15321.74s -> 15330.89s]  see me do this? Like, oh, okay. Nobody gives a shit about your gold silverware. Give me that one,
[15330.89s -> 15343.61s]  I don't want that one. I'd buy a silverware because if they had a stone and I would say
[15343.61s -> 15350.89s]  I wouldn't even care. All right. This exotic styling and intricate embossed detail,
[15350.89s -> 15356.25s]  this Paul Meadow Road 30, $3,500 from Ashley can transform the atmosphere of any room
[15356.25s -> 15363.05s]  from the Ashley companies. Maybe more, like five grand maybe. And it's carpet too.

[15375.21s -> 15381.69s]  You can also win these authentic German beer steins. All right. That's cool. It's a collection of
[15381.69s -> 15386.65s]  limited edition German beer steins. I gotta try to get one of these so I can. With these authentic
[15386.65s -> 15394.81s]  German made steins featuring fancy comical or decorative butylins. And take a look at
[15394.81s -> 15403.00s]  this fantastic trip to Germany. Going to Germany. A round trip coach from Los Angeles to Munich,
[15403.00s -> 15409.32s]  Germany for a six night stay at a luxury hotel. Eat, drink, and be merry in Bavaria's capital city.
[15409.32s -> 15413.00s]  All right. I'm going to say. These can be yours if the price is right.
[15413.64s -> 15421.24s]  That's probably 10, 12 grand, 10 grand. The steins are probably $1,200, $2,000. The steins
[15421.24s -> 15442.12s]  are probably $2,000. The 15, 16. I'm going to say. I'm going to say $16,000. $16,000. $16,492.
[15442.12s -> 15453.32s]  Okay. You've both bid on your showcases. Let's see what they're worth. The actual retail price
[15453.32s -> 15464.68s]  of the second showcase is a difference of actual retail price of the first showcase is
[15469.44s -> 15473.52s]  is over. The actual retail price. I'm going to Germany. Let's go.
[15487.76s -> 15494.65s]  Very good. We'll do one more. We'll do one more and then we're going to play. We'll probably be
[15494.65s -> 15510.67s]  able to play another one or two. I think I've got a good one. Now don't. Please don't. Please
[15510.67s -> 15516.67s]  don't play this one. I love the price is right. It's a little like ice cream.
[15524.48s -> 15534.48s]  I'm going to do a heck of a lot. Probably like another potentially like 18 to 20 hours.
[15536.00s -> 15545.13s]  So I have to do this again. The contestant with the bid closest to the actual retail price of the
[15545.13s -> 15550.65s]  item without going over wins the item and gets to come up on stage to play up. And I have some
[15550.65s -> 15557.69s]  digitally downloading the item up for bid. A handsome entertainment cabinet. I think I've
[15557.69s -> 15564.17s]  overshot that as well. Furniture designs by Picasso. American made dark oak entertainment center
[15564.17s -> 15570.01s]  features retractable doors, curio sides and tee tops from furniture designed by Picasso.
[15570.97s -> 15578.28s]  There's about 17 games left. 18 games. Each one of those games will probably take about
[15578.28s -> 15583.96s]  30 to you know between 40 minutes and like two hours is what we've done on each one of these.
[15590.09s -> 15593.05s]  I didn't. I don't know what this was. So we're going to do one dollar.
[15600.16s -> 15605.82s]  Sorry Bob. I wasn't listening to anything you said but I still win.
[15606.54s -> 15622.67s]  You just don't want to go over. Cliffhangers. $16,000. What? Are you serious? Get fucking pumped.
[15622.67s -> 15627.07s]  There's a mountain climber will take one step on the mountain. If he goes too far up the mountain,
[15627.07s -> 15632.43s]  he'll fall off and you'll lose. But if he's still on the path after you bid on the items, you'll win.
[15633.15s -> 15638.19s]  Here's the first item you'll be bidding on. The 80s edition of Soap Opera Challenge.
[15638.19s -> 15644.14s]  It's your drama by the day. Questions about your favorite soap. So you think is the price of this
[15644.14s -> 15652.00s]  item. Enter your bid for this item. It's a soap opera board card game. 19.
[15652.88s -> 15660.60s]  Let me say 19 bucks. I have no way that's more than 25 dollars.
[15661.16s -> 15680.44s]  Do you have the item? No. Let's see how many steps he'll take.
[15696.80s -> 15701.84s]  19. We have Spencer's. Everything children's clothing is meant to be durable easy care
[15701.84s -> 15707.20s]  Spencer's. American made will stand the test of time. What do you think is the price of this item?
[15708.00s -> 15714.86s]  I just want to clarify. I don't even know what this is. That looks like a trash bag, diapers,
[15715.66s -> 15719.82s]  and like a moist towelette case. I don't know what this is. This is clothes.
[15720.94s -> 15735.56s]  40? Is it kids clothing? Like is that like a little onesie? Probably 20. 25.
[15738.09s -> 15740.17s]  No. Let's see how many steps he'll take.

[16415.36s -> 16431.39s]  I had that first time. It's just a thing. Xbox controller. It has four directionals,
[16431.39s -> 16434.91s]  but this button is the same button no matter what. It's every button.
[16435.95s -> 16439.63s]  No matter if it's left, up, right, down, when you press one of these, every single one is pressed.
[16441.23s -> 16444.11s]  It's just a circle in there. All right. So this is a new car. What kind of car?

[16462.03s -> 16468.60s]  grand. Four grand. You can win your playing, Professor Price. To successfully answer three

[16475.24s -> 16481.88s]  in his left hand. If you get three incorrect answers, good luck. And these are the last two
[16481.88s -> 16488.52s]  numbers and the value of the prize. Here's your first question. How many ounces are in a half pint?
[16509.61s -> 16519.48s]  Six. Eight ounces for glass. Eight ounces is a cup. I'm American. I only know as the leaders
[16520.28s -> 16532.59s]  jugs and gallons and I only know as gallons and a gallon is I just know what it looks like. It's
[16532.59s -> 16550.03s]  just like a big a gallon is a pint, a half pint. A pint is 20, 24 ounces. So a half pint would be
[16550.03s -> 16558.56s]  16. No, when you get like when you get a pint, when you get a pint at the bar, that's that's
[16558.56s -> 16581.74s]  20. Is it 21 or 20 ounces? 24. A pint is 16. That's what I'm saying. So it's eight. 1.9 GPA
[16581.74s -> 16589.50s]  was actually 2.7. Nice try though. What do you mean? No, it's not. The value. That's your second
[16589.50s -> 16594.81s]  correct answer. One more and you win. Let's update the score. Here's your next question.
[16595.53s -> 16598.73s]  In baseball, how many runs is a Grand Slam home run?
[16599.53s -> 16623.92s]  Showdown. You'll spin the wheel. If your spin or your combination of two spins is higher than
[16623.92s -> 16629.36s]  the current leader, you'll wonder if you're going to have 75 to 90. Probably 90. If you go,
[16629.36s -> 16635.04s]  if your total, if this is the current leader, beat his score to win. Wow. I can't believe I
[16635.04s -> 16643.68s]  have to go higher than 75 every single time. Oh great. One day I'll be able to go over that number.
[16655.69s -> 16663.08s]  80 please. 15. Your result is lower than, you have to spin the wheel. It's your turn to spin.
[16674.43s -> 16683.69s]  Stop on 70. 70. Yes. You win. Showcase. This is this is the big one. This is the big one.
[16695.58s -> 16699.50s]  Hoomer yells at a video game. There are two showcases up for bid. I mean I've yelled a few
[16699.50s -> 16703.18s]  times. The closest to the actual retail price. You are correct. If your bid is with, let's see
[16703.18s -> 16708.30s]  the first showcase. First showcase coming up. Your showcase begins with a game set.
[16709.10s -> 16713.42s]  If you want to play the game, do it in style. This is two chairs. This is a dinner table. The table
[16713.42s -> 16718.22s]  is a part with solids with an inlaid game surface. The chairs in a screen finish,
[16718.22s -> 16725.42s]  velvet upholstery, and brass hardware. And in the next shop we find this. A platform bed. Made by
[16725.42s -> 16730.38s]  hand. It's just the thing for a small bedroom and can be taken apart for you. The bed is made by
[16730.38s -> 16734.62s]  hand. Accommodates a queen-size mattress. Somebody stuffed it. And there's a range.
[16735.42s -> 16741.42s]  And the only other thing that existed in the 70s is the stove. I would really hate to play
[16741.42s -> 16748.38s]  the Sims back in the 70s. Your house would just be stoves, beds, and wooden chairs.
[16757.95s -> 16759.15s]  That's what it is now.
[16765.31s -> 16771.07s]  All right. Do you want to? No, there's other stuff in the Sims.
[16773.07s -> 16783.93s]  I don't want this one. You do it. 1446. Wow. That's going to really be great.
[16783.93s -> 16793.47s]  Your showcase begins with a new dining room. Table made out of wood. Probably $700 bucks.
[16793.47s -> 16800.49s]  A wood buffet server for side chairs and two armchairs made of veneers and solids.
[16800.49s -> 16807.68s]  And for a lovelier table, there's stoneware. Gourmet brown rich stoneware by Falscraft.
[16807.68s -> 16812.24s]  Handcrafted charm. The ideal in formal settings. Dishwasher safe. Chipper system.
[16815.52s -> 16820.09s]  Hey, what was your showcase? Oh, you know, a table just like yours. I don't rug.
[16821.37s -> 16826.33s]  I wait. I wonder if I'll get a stove too. Oh, I hope so.
[16826.33s -> 16839.56s]  No, mine's way better than yours. Mine is so much cooler than yours.
[16840.36s -> 16842.52s]  Have fun with your wooden stove.
[16852.01s -> 16861.21s]  All right. I'm thinking that's probably at least $1,500 to $2,000 plus $3,000 or $4,000.
[16861.21s -> 16867.61s]  How much do you think your showcase is worth? The table is probably $800.
[16868.81s -> 16879.13s]  The RVs with the motorhome thing, the trailer thing is probably $2,000. $1,500.
[16880.49s -> 16883.77s]  I'm thinking $20,000. And then the carpet is probably $500. I'm thinking $2,800.
[16883.77s -> 16897.64s]  $3,000. $3,000. $3,000. $3,300. $3,000. $3,200. $3,300. $3,200. $3,300. $3,200. $3,300. $3,300. $3,300. $3,300. $3,300. $3,100. $3,-F explaining.
[16897.64s -> 16900.52s]  $3,300. $3,300. $3,300. $3,300. $3,300. $3,300. $3,300. $3,500. $3,300. $3,300. $3,300. That's it.
[16900.52s -> 16904.36s]  Okay. You've both bid on your showcases. Let's see what they're worth.
[16904.36s -> 16907.56s]  The actual retail price of the second showcase is.
[16910.11s -> 16911.15s]  Oh boy!
[16911.15s -> 16924.84s]  For a difference of. The actual retail price of the first showcase is. Wait. For a difference of. Did I lose?
[16924.84s -> 16948.54s]  Your opponent's been his closest. You don't win anything. I'm gonna fall. I don't know why I did this.
[16948.54s -> 16954.61s]  I have nothing to support me right now. I'm gonna fall down. I'm gonna fall.
[16954.61s -> 16961.20s]  I'm wearing socks. You don't do this in socks. And you don't do this in socks?
[16961.20s -> 16966.01s]  Okay, I gotta go for it. I have to fall. I gotta go for it. One, two, three.
[16966.01s -> 16972.39s]  I couldn't stand up. There's no way. It's impossible.
[16972.39s -> 16981.35s]  You did your best. I did do my best. It's time to do something else.
[16981.35s -> 16988.52s]  So. I've probably got. Just about five hours.
[16993.08s -> 17001.44s]  Let's go for. This is a fan favorite. If I'm gonna do like one, maybe two more.
[17001.44s -> 17004.44s]  This is the fan favorite one we gotta do right now.
[17004.44s -> 17033.90s]  It is not Family Feud. Kung Fu High Impact. Remember this?
[17033.90s -> 17049.60s]  Star Wars? Yeah, I did Star Wars for like an hour and a half earlier.
[17049.60s -> 17060.80s]  Here we go. There's so many more over here.
[17060.80s -> 17064.80s]  But I don't want to just blow through because there's a lot of good stuff over here.
[17064.80s -> 17069.30s]  There's a lot of good stuff in here. A lot of good stuff that we've played already.
[17069.30s -> 17075.25s]  It's time to kick some ass.
[17075.25s -> 17088.58s]  They have this shit for Kinect. And it's probably way better than the one that I played.
[17088.58s -> 17103.15s]  Get a bat over here. I got one.
[17103.15s -> 17108.63s]  Save data must be created. Save it.
[17108.63s -> 17113.38s]  The storage device memory unit will be used. That's fine.
[17113.38s -> 17118.96s]  So I'm gonna get off camera here because I'm just in the game.
[17118.96s -> 17121.96s]  So why would I? There's no reason for me to be on camera.
[17121.96s -> 17128.02s]  Here we go. That, okay. That's not what I wanted to do.
[17128.02s -> 17131.86s]  Uh, close.
[17131.86s -> 17141.09s]  Difficulty normal is fine. Here we go.
[17141.09s -> 17166.82s]  Tell me the story.
[17185.04s -> 17189.04s]  Things of that magnitude do not end easily.
[17189.04s -> 17196.44s]  The stories unfinished tend to carry on when you least expect it.
[17196.44s -> 17203.71s]  So it begins.
[17203.71s -> 17208.28s]  Ah, what a nice place.
[17208.28s -> 17210.28s]  How did they get here?
[17210.28s -> 17212.28s]  I didn't think I was supposed to be leaning.
[17212.28s -> 17214.28s]  What was there?
[17214.28s -> 17227.88s]  I don't know, Jeremy. Who is there?
[17227.88s -> 17234.60s]  You gonna do anything else?
[17234.60s -> 17236.60s]  Stretch before playing to prevent aching muscles.
[17236.60s -> 17239.77s]  Well, why didn't you tell me that like six hours ago?
[17239.77s -> 17249.86s]  Oh, Mike, that's where my whole body hurts right now.
[17249.86s -> 17255.17s]  Round one. Is that me?
[17255.17s -> 17258.73s]  Welcome to Kung Fu High Impact.
[17258.73s -> 17263.12s]  Are you ready to kick some serious ass?
[17263.12s -> 17265.12s]  Let's go through a few tricks.
[17265.12s -> 17267.12s]  That's the clothes I was wearing yesterday.
[17267.12s -> 17270.12s]  Enemies are to your left and right.
[17270.12s -> 17272.62s]  Fight in your own style. They sure are.
[17272.62s -> 17275.62s]  All moves deal damage as long as they're fast enough.
[17275.62s -> 17280.80s]  Like this guy over here.
[17280.80s -> 17284.30s]  Hey, how are ya?
[17284.30s -> 17290.17s]  Sorry about that.
[17290.17s -> 17292.17s]  Why am I so tiny?
[17292.17s -> 17294.17s]  I really should be taller.
[17294.17s -> 17296.17s]  Is it not correct?
[17296.17s -> 17306.88s]  It's not correct. The Kinect is in a wrong spot.
[17306.88s -> 17312.29s]  Hey, guys. Check this out.
[17312.29s -> 17320.74s]  I gotta umbre calibrating this.
[17320.74s -> 17323.74s]  I need to be like fucking three feet taller.
[17323.74s -> 17325.74s]  See, the Kinect doesn't even have my feet. Look it.
[17325.74s -> 17327.74s]  Look it. See?
[17327.74s -> 17329.74s]  Look. It's cutting me off.
[17329.74s -> 17332.74s]  I don't even have shins.
[17332.74s -> 17334.74s]  Look.
[17339.56s -> 17353.86s]  Got him.
[17358.86s -> 17362.25s]  You got it.
[17362.25s -> 17365.25s]  Dodge, jump, punch, double punch.
[17365.25s -> 17391.48s]  Get out of here.
[17391.48s -> 17392.48s]  Where is he?
[17392.48s -> 17393.97s]  No!
[17393.97s -> 17404.28s]  Round four.
[17404.28s -> 17406.28s]  I'm gonna go this way.
[17409.58s -> 17411.58s]  That's so awesome.
[17411.58s -> 17413.58s]  I have to get to the options.
[17418.14s -> 17423.07s]  So you have to dodge.
[17423.07s -> 17433.16s]  Block. Nice.
[17433.16s -> 17443.76s]  So I have to ju- I can't dodge red.
[17443.76s -> 17448.40s]  Did I get it?
[17448.40s -> 17450.40s]  I'm gonna cartwheel into him, motherfucker.
[17450.40s -> 17452.96s]  I swear to God.
[17458.96s -> 17463.16s]  That's what I do, is this.
[17465.16s -> 17474.40s]  Here we go.
[17474.40s -> 17475.40s]  Come here.
[17475.40s -> 17489.64s]  I saw more. I'm a big fan of the one, two, three.
[17489.64s -> 17495.47s]  Alright. I need to take-
[17495.47s -> 17498.84s]  I gotta get the Kinect to fix itself.
[17498.84s -> 17509.27s]  Gamer picture? Where?
[17509.27s -> 17514.00s]  What? What?
[17514.00s -> 17547.55s]  What?
[17556.07s -> 17558.07s]  Let's look at my headband.
[17581.92s -> 17582.92s]  Looks ordinary.
[17582.92s -> 17585.92s]  But believe me, I've seen the strange powers these comics have.
[17585.92s -> 17591.92s]  Yeah, I guess you could say working for a wizard has its own twists and turns.
[17593.23s -> 17613.56s]  What the fuck is the sound of this?
[17613.56s -> 17614.56s]  Here we go.
[17614.56s -> 17619.47s]  It's time to be a fighter.
[17619.47s -> 17621.47s]  Take control of the battlefield and use power punch.
[17621.47s -> 17623.47s]  The faster you move from side to side, the more distance you cover in the game.
[17623.47s -> 17633.68s]  Kicks and punches also move you forward.
[17633.68s -> 17637.68s]  Use somersaults to reach higher platforms or escape danger.
[17637.68s -> 17639.68s]  You can even surprise your enemies from behind.
[17639.68s -> 17640.68s]  How do I do that?
[17640.68s -> 17645.18s]  All at once. Jump, throw your hands up, and bend.
[17647.89s -> 17651.60s]  I need new legs.
[17651.60s -> 17655.64s]  Why did my parents say that to me?
[17655.64s -> 17659.76s]  What happened?
[17659.76s -> 17665.86s]  See.
[17665.86s -> 17675.74s]  Oh, I gotta go this way.
[17675.74s -> 17690.23s]  Power ups?
[17690.23s -> 17699.83s]  Where's there- is there-
[17701.83s -> 17706.40s]  Why did it not work?
[17712.08s -> 17721.32s]  I just stomped him.
[17721.32s -> 17723.32s]  Alright, my headphones came off.
[17723.32s -> 17724.32s]  Stop boring out.
[17724.32s -> 17727.81s]  Use power punch to slam the doors shut.
[17727.81s -> 17744.48s]  I gotta block.
[17744.48s -> 17748.44s]  I gotta remember to block.
[17748.44s -> 17761.82s]  Power punch, shut the doors.
[17761.82s -> 17763.82s]  I just taunted when I wasn't supposed to.
[17763.82s -> 17774.19s]  You can't taunt.
[17774.19s -> 17791.45s]  I'm almost dead.
[17791.45s -> 17792.45s]  Check this move out.
[17792.45s -> 17795.14s]  These guys just keep boring out.
[17795.14s -> 17797.38s]  Use power punch to slam doors shut.
[17797.38s -> 17804.42s]  I'm trying to close the door.
[17805.42s -> 17806.85s]  Alright, I got it.
[17806.85s -> 17807.85s]  Door closed.
[17807.85s -> 17817.13s]  They've gotten out of that one.
[17817.13s -> 17818.13s]  Which way are they coming?
[17818.13s -> 17822.06s]  Is it the guy in the frame?
[17839.17s -> 17845.79s]  Oh, my stomach.
[17891.55s -> 17894.39s]  Come on over here.
[17894.39s -> 17895.39s]  Why don't you-
[17895.39s -> 17922.87s]  Hey!
[17922.87s -> 17941.26s]  Close the door.
[17941.26s -> 17944.80s]  Do a backflip.
[17944.80s -> 17961.60s]  I did it.
[17961.60s -> 17964.88s]  Do a backflip.
[17964.88s -> 17965.88s]  Jesus.
[17965.88s -> 17989.70s]  Ow.
[17989.70s -> 17990.70s]  Ow.
[17990.70s -> 17991.70s]  Ow.
[17991.70s -> 17992.70s]  Ow.
[17992.70s -> 18014.57s]  Oh, I gotta close that.
[18014.57s -> 18015.57s]  Power punch.
[18015.57s -> 18016.57s]  Power punch.
[18016.57s -> 18017.57s]  Power punch.
[18017.57s -> 18021.63s]  Close.
[18021.63s -> 18022.63s]  This.
[18022.63s -> 18023.80s]  Fucking.
[18023.80s -> 18024.80s]  Door.
[18024.80s -> 18025.80s]  Door.
[18029.00s -> 18045.73s]  See ya.
[18045.73s -> 18068.20s]  The Irish stanchion technique.
[18068.20s -> 18069.20s]  Close it.
[18069.20s -> 18072.36s]  You.
[18072.36s -> 18084.92s]  Close it.
[18084.92s -> 18085.92s]  No.
[18123.71s -> 18141.83s]  Close it.
[18141.83s -> 18144.28s]  Up.
[18144.28s -> 18149.43s]  Other way.
[18149.43s -> 18151.05s]  Backwards.
[18151.05s -> 18153.44s]  Back.
[18153.44s -> 18163.20s]  Forward.
[18163.20s -> 18165.01s]  Get up there.
[18165.01s -> 18166.01s]  Oh, I just caught real-
[18166.01s -> 18193.71s]  God damn it.
[18193.71s -> 18194.71s]  Get.
[18196.84s -> 18197.84s]  Get over there.
[18197.84s -> 18199.79s]  Up.
[18199.79s -> 18207.17s]  Go.
[18207.17s -> 18208.41s]  Go forward.
[18211.44s -> 18214.48s]  Get.
[18214.48s -> 18216.48s]  Oh, my God.
[18216.48s -> 18245.24s]  Don't do it.
[18245.24s -> 18267.79s]  I'm fine.
[18267.79s -> 18281.04s]  Go drink some water.
[18281.04s -> 18282.04s]  What?
[18308.28s -> 18312.46s]  It worked.
[18312.46s -> 18313.46s]  Stay down.
[18313.46s -> 18316.81s]  Whoa.
[18316.81s -> 18319.81s]  It was like a Halloween party gone seriously wrong.
[18319.81s -> 18327.68s]  Thanks, guys, but I have to skip the party and get back to work.
[18327.68s -> 18335.81s]  Same freaks.
[18335.81s -> 18337.81s]  Hey, I worked there.
[18337.81s -> 18338.81s]  Cut it out.
[18338.81s -> 18371.35s]  Bonus items.
[18371.35s -> 18375.78s]  These mystic stones contain health or special powers.
[18375.78s -> 18379.15s]  Smash them to get to the goodies inside.
[18382.05s -> 18385.85s]  Ah.
[18385.85s -> 18386.85s]  Great.
[18387.85s -> 18388.85s]  Excuse you.
[18394.51s -> 18395.51s]  Goodies?
[18395.51s -> 18396.51s]  Where are they?
[18396.51s -> 18411.12s]  In here?
[18411.12s -> 18426.19s]  I'm the best still.
[18426.19s -> 18427.19s]  Double up cut.
[18427.19s -> 18429.19s]  I gotta utilize the up cut more often.
[18429.19s -> 18442.05s]  Double front head.
[18442.05s -> 18464.60s]  Adopted feet.
[18465.60s -> 18467.04s]  Nice.
[18467.04s -> 18473.24s]  Back to sneak into the alley.
[18473.24s -> 18476.89s]  What happens if I make myself, like, just tiny?
[18476.89s -> 18478.89s]  And they, like, not touch me?
[18495.88s -> 18530.14s]  This tank is empty.
[18530.14s -> 18534.71s]  I don't have any most...
[18534.71s -> 18540.81s]  I'm out of gas.
[18540.81s -> 18543.24s]  I don't have to...
[18543.24s -> 18561.32s]  Oh.
[18561.32s -> 18573.50s]  Kick him.
[18573.50s -> 18575.57s]  I can't hear anybody.
[18575.57s -> 18580.33s]  I need a...
[18580.33s -> 18581.57s]  I need health.
[18581.57s -> 18587.16s]  Where's their health?
[18587.16s -> 18588.16s]  Did I get it?
[18588.16s -> 18589.16s]  Who the fuck is that?
[18589.16s -> 18599.24s]  Wait.
[18599.24s -> 18600.24s]  Let's talk about this.
[18600.24s -> 18620.85s]  You don't know.
[18620.85s -> 18625.18s]  On call four.
[18625.18s -> 18626.18s]  What?
[18626.18s -> 18634.84s]  What?
[18634.84s -> 18643.96s]  What are you doing?
[18643.96s -> 18644.96s]  What the fuck?
[18663.80s -> 18664.80s]  Bonus items.
[18664.80s -> 18668.80s]  These mystic stones contain health or special powers.
[18668.80s -> 18672.04s]  Smash them to get to the goodies inside.
[18675.00s -> 18677.63s]  Thanks for coming to the stream.
[18677.63s -> 18680.93s]  I'll see you guys when we're playing Ancestors.
[18681.93s -> 18684.13s]  Nice.
[18685.13s -> 18686.82s]  Get off me.
[18686.82s -> 18687.82s]  I'm trying to talk.
[18687.82s -> 18688.82s]  I'm trying to do my outro.
[18702.73s -> 18703.73s]  Oh no.
[18703.73s -> 18705.73s]  It's a child temper tantrum.
[18705.73s -> 18706.73s]  It's working.
[18717.74s -> 18718.74s]  Energy.
[18721.96s -> 18723.97s]  Rekindle.
[18724.97s -> 18731.52s]  You guys have seen...
[18732.52s -> 18735.53s]  You guys have seen Kingpin.
[18735.53s -> 18741.56s]  When Big Earth McCracken is bowling his ass off.
[18741.56s -> 18745.87s]  His, like, wig is just all over the place.
[18746.87s -> 18774.63s]  I gotta get this boss.
[18774.63s -> 18794.28s]  I'm really fighting.
[18794.28s -> 18795.28s]  Okay.
[18795.28s -> 18796.28s]  Time for a weapon.
[18796.28s -> 18816.52s]  Not helping.
[18816.52s -> 18817.52s]  It's too heavy.
[18817.52s -> 18823.09s]  Get that obelisk.
[18823.09s -> 18848.05s]  They can't hit what they can't see.
[18874.25s -> 18896.46s]  You know that guy you see in the gym sometimes
[18896.46s -> 18898.46s]  that's there for three and a half hours?
[18898.46s -> 18901.46s]  And he's, like, literally waters coming down from his body?
[18901.46s -> 18904.89s]  At two and a half hours under that guy.
[18904.89s -> 18908.89s]  I am stronger than the fucking huge guy in the gym
[18908.89s -> 18910.89s]  that does cardio for three and a half hours.
[18910.89s -> 18912.89s]  I'm stronger than that guy.
[18920.28s -> 18921.28s]  Hold on.
[18921.28s -> 18922.28s]  Where's my mushroom?
[18923.96s -> 18924.96s]  There's one.
[18925.96s -> 18926.96s]  What?
[18927.96s -> 18931.19s]  I tried.
[18931.19s -> 18933.19s]  I tried to make the mushroom sound.
[18946.01s -> 18947.01s]  It just ate Toad.
[18955.55s -> 18957.94s]  Get out of here.
[18978.70s -> 18996.20s]  Hey.
[18996.20s -> 18997.20s]  Why is that somehow worse?
[19014.31s -> 19015.74s]  I heard a crack.
[19016.74s -> 19023.88s]  Aim the camera down or push it back so you can get your legs in.
[19024.88s -> 19026.88s]  The Kinect has, like, a mind of its own.
[19027.88s -> 19033.28s]  I'm doing better.
[19044.38s -> 19045.38s]  Do you have to be strong to play this?
[19045.38s -> 19046.38s]  Yeah.
[19046.38s -> 19048.84s]  Strong enough.
[19054.53s -> 19060.38s]  That's a good technique.
[19060.38s -> 19062.38s]  The fucking, like, octopus hands.
[19062.38s -> 19073.24s]  Or, like, the directing symphony, whichever one you want to call it.
[19073.24s -> 19095.40s]  Put me thrash.
[19095.40s -> 19096.40s]  What?
[19096.40s -> 19106.78s]  Oh.
[19106.78s -> 19107.78s]  Get out of here.
[19107.78s -> 19129.18s]  I just kicked his ass.
[19129.18s -> 19130.18s]  Pee-pee-poo-poo.
[19171.80s -> 19172.80s]  Chapter four.
[19172.80s -> 19173.80s]  Helmet blunder.
[19173.80s -> 19179.69s]  Who are these guys?
[19179.69s -> 19183.38s]  They sure don't look like your ordinary comic book fans.
[19184.68s -> 19186.68s]  Okay, let's figure this out.
[19186.68s -> 19190.31s]  Anyway, warn me about something before she left.
[19192.06s -> 19194.06s]  Here's a list of tasks for you to do.
[19194.06s -> 19196.06s]  I feel like I shouldn't even be in the scene.
[19196.06s -> 19198.06s]  Especially the last one.
[19199.06s -> 19201.88s]  See, I'm pretty sure I did everything.
[19203.69s -> 19204.69s]  Save the world.
[19204.69s -> 19205.69s]  Check.
[19205.69s -> 19206.69s]  Clean up.
[19206.69s -> 19207.69s]  Check.
[19207.69s -> 19208.69s]  Destroy Kuang's helmet.
[19209.69s -> 19211.69s]  Destroy Kuang's helmet!
[19211.69s -> 19212.69s]  Oh, crap.
[19212.69s -> 19214.69s]  It's still in the basement.
[19214.69s -> 19217.32s]  Maybe it's just a coincidence.
[19217.32s -> 19219.32s]  Those guys might have nothing to do with the helmet.
[19219.32s -> 19223.67s]  Doesn't look like much.
[19223.67s -> 19227.70s]  Let's get the job done.
[19230.22s -> 19231.22s]  I'll take that.
[19231.22s -> 19232.22s]  What?
[19232.22s -> 19237.81s]  Who the heck are you?
[19237.81s -> 19247.76s]  Kron?
[19247.76s -> 19249.76s]  I'm assuming this is a boss fight.
[19249.76s -> 19257.01s]  All right, I can take...
[19257.01s -> 19258.01s]  I can get...
[19258.01s -> 19259.01s]  I can beat this boss.
[19259.01s -> 19275.38s]  I have faith.
[19275.38s -> 19276.88s]  Backing off?
[19276.88s -> 19277.88s]  Don't matter.
[19277.88s -> 19279.37s]  Stay down.
[19279.37s -> 19288.52s]  I'm not gonna take a fucking hit.
[19288.52s -> 19292.58s]  Set the back one!
[19292.58s -> 19294.58s]  That's the only one you get!
[19294.58s -> 19321.04s]  Back breaker.
[19321.04s -> 19336.80s]  Sidekick.
[19336.80s -> 19337.80s]  Bingo.
[19337.80s -> 19361.89s]  Full health.
[19361.89s -> 19362.89s]  We're good.
[19362.89s -> 19367.78s]  Fuck out of here.
[19367.78s -> 19375.14s]  Oh, I just got combo'd.
[19375.14s -> 19392.12s]  Not bad.
[19392.12s -> 19393.12s]  I like the bouncing ball technique.
[19393.12s -> 19394.12s]  It's pretty good.
[19394.12s -> 19396.45s]  Checkpoint.
[19396.45s -> 19402.90s]  New pound shaker.
[19402.90s -> 19408.66s]  Pound shaker may not do much damage, but it throws your enemies off.
[19408.66s -> 19412.66s]  It can also damage particularly sturdy enemies.
[19412.66s -> 19414.09s]  All right.
[19414.09s -> 19416.09s]  Jump up and slam your hand to the ground as you land.
[19416.09s -> 19426.09s]  Jump up and slam your hand to the ground as you land.
[19426.09s -> 19436.23s]  Even that move don't work.
[19436.23s -> 19440.23s]  Jump up and slam your hand to the ground as you land.
[19440.23s -> 19448.06s]  Shit.
[19448.06s -> 19449.56s]  It's shredder.
[19449.56s -> 19458.80s]  Ow.
[19458.80s -> 19459.80s]  Ow.
[19459.80s -> 19460.80s]  Ow.
[19460.80s -> 19461.80s]  Idiot.
[19461.80s -> 19462.80s]  Stupid idiot.
[19462.80s -> 19468.88s]  Mom's gonna kill you when she finds out you took my car.
[19468.88s -> 19469.88s]  I destroy him.
[19469.88s -> 19472.65s]  I bet you think Rob Schneider is funny.
[19472.65s -> 19473.65s]  Yeah, I do.
[19473.65s -> 19474.65s]  That's a pretty good bet.
[19474.65s -> 19475.65s]  I can do this one.
[19475.65s -> 19476.65s]  Chapter five.
[19476.65s -> 19477.65s]  Eye of the Dragon.
[19477.65s -> 19497.84s]  Oh, man.
[19497.84s -> 19498.84s]  You scared the crap out of me.
[19498.84s -> 19499.84s]  I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.
[19499.84s -> 19542.93s]  Oh, man.
[19542.93s -> 19543.93s]  You scared the crap out of me.
[19543.93s -> 19544.93s]  I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.
[19544.93s -> 19553.15s]  Oh, man.
[19553.15s -> 19554.15s]  You scared the crap out of me.
[19554.15s -> 19555.71s]  I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.
[19555.71s -> 19576.85s]  Oh, man.
[19576.85s -> 19577.85s]  You scared the crap out of me.
[19577.85s -> 19582.87s]  I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.
[19582.87s -> 19583.87s]  Oh, man.
[19583.87s -> 19586.13s]  You scared the crap out of me.
[19586.13s -> 19587.13s]  I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.
[19587.13s -> 19591.25s]  Oh, man.
[19591.25s -> 19604.97s]  You scared the crap out of me.
[19604.97s -> 19644.74s]  I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.
[19644.74s -> 19645.74s]  Oh, man.
[19645.74s -> 19646.74s]  You scared the crap out of me.
[19658.74s -> 19659.74s]  Oh, man.
[19659.74s -> 19661.17s]  You scared the crap out of me.
[19661.17s -> 19662.17s]  I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.
[19662.17s -> 19663.17s]  Oh, man.
[19663.17s -> 19664.17s]  You scared the crap out of me.
[19664.17s -> 19665.17s]  I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.
[19665.17s -> 19666.54s]  Oh, man.
[19666.54s -> 19667.54s]  You scared the crap out of me.
[19667.54s -> 19668.54s]  I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.
[19668.54s -> 19669.54s]  Oh, man.
[19669.54s -> 19670.54s]  You scared the crap out of me.
[19670.54s -> 19671.54s]  I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.
[19671.54s -> 19672.97s]  Oh, man.
[19672.97s -> 19673.97s]  You scared the crap out of me.
[19673.97s -> 19674.97s]  I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.
[19674.97s -> 19675.97s]  Oh, man.
[19675.97s -> 19676.97s]  You scared the crap out of me.
[19676.97s -> 19677.97s]  I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.
[19677.97s -> 19681.45s]  Oh, man.
[19681.45s -> 19682.45s]  You scared the crap out of me.
[19682.45s -> 19683.45s]  I have to get rid of the helmet before anything else happens.
[19684.45s -> 19686.45s]  I'm going to become the Lich King.
[19710.16s -> 19711.16s]  Not a promotion in that one.
[19711.16s -> 19712.16s]  Better done better than that.
[19736.84s -> 19739.84s]  I feel like I've been in that position like three or four times today.
[19739.84s -> 19742.66s]  My body is emanating heat.
[19742.66s -> 19750.66s]  We're going to have to go with a new strategy.
[19750.66s -> 19763.78s]  Probably lost five pounds today.
[19763.78s -> 19764.78s]  No.
[19764.78s -> 19767.66s]  I need a new strat.
[19767.66s -> 19770.69s]  Oh, right there.
[19770.69s -> 19773.69s]  They're not going to be able to hit me because I'm disappearing.
[19773.69s -> 19802.39s]  Much easier.
[19802.39s -> 19816.49s]  What do you got?
[19816.49s -> 19824.08s]  Well, I should have been doing this from the beginning.
[19824.08s -> 19832.53s]  It's permanent Liu Kang.
[19832.53s -> 19834.96s]  I unlocked the secret.
[19834.96s -> 19846.06s]  Woo.
[19846.06s -> 19862.98s]  I remember this part.
[19862.98s -> 19872.32s]  Did I do the same joke last time?
[19872.32s -> 19874.32s]  I think I may have.
[19874.32s -> 19905.66s]  This is the best defense if you have like an older brother.
[19906.66s -> 19909.66s]  This is the little brother defense against the older brother.
[19909.66s -> 19911.84s]  I used to do it all the time.
[19911.84s -> 19915.36s]  You just go like this.
[19915.36s -> 19916.36s]  And they're going to be able to get you.
[19916.36s -> 19945.52s]  I almost just ripped my pants.
[19945.52s -> 19963.72s]  Did they rip?
[19963.72s -> 19969.72s]  Can you imagine if I went like this and it split right in the middle on camera?
[19969.72s -> 19971.72s]  That would be really bad.
[19971.72s -> 19977.29s]  Like just just like boom.
[19977.29s -> 19978.29s]  Oh my God.
[19978.29s -> 19979.29s]  That would be.
[19979.29s -> 19980.29s]  You know, I would accept it.
[19980.29s -> 19982.29s]  I would accept defeat at that point.
[19995.76s -> 19998.02s]  Not wearing underwear yet.
[19998.02s -> 19999.02s]  Why?
[19999.02s -> 20000.02s]  What are you talking about?
[20000.02s -> 20001.39s]  What?
[20001.39s -> 20006.39s]  My pants are going to rip in the middle and then like my all my shit is going to come out.
[20006.39s -> 20036.53s]  Dude, I'll give it to people that get sick.
[20036.53s -> 20039.53s]  I mean, obviously I've been doing this for like six hours or so.
[20039.53s -> 20042.71s]  But imagine starting this shit.
[20042.71s -> 20046.71s]  This game is just you're constantly moving around.
[20046.71s -> 20048.71s]  Forget about like Zumba class.
[20048.71s -> 20049.71s]  Just go get this.
[20049.71s -> 20051.71s]  Go download it.
[20051.71s -> 20052.71s]  Still on the Xbox Store.
[20052.71s -> 20054.71s]  Go get it.
[20054.71s -> 20055.71s]  You want to work out?
[20055.71s -> 20056.71s]  Go sit, sit chair.
[20056.71s -> 20057.71s]  Put your legs up.
[20057.71s -> 20068.46s]  Rip your pants in half.
[20068.46s -> 20073.88s]  I'm up for this one.
[20073.88s -> 20127.81s]  There's hair in my mouth still from like an hour and a half ago.
[20127.81s -> 20128.81s]  Is the chair fighting?
[20128.81s -> 20137.26s]  Come on, get him chair.
[20137.26s -> 20138.82s]  You can do it.
[20138.82s -> 20144.71s]  It's like Dr. Strain.
[20144.71s -> 20157.53s]  Back it up.
[20157.53s -> 20172.12s]  Ah, you tried.
[20172.12s -> 20173.12s]  You tried.
[20173.12s -> 20178.76s]  Chair is doing better than me.
[20178.76s -> 20188.44s]  Shred the chair.
[20188.44s -> 20190.44s]  No, I'm not going to shred this game.
[20190.44s -> 20201.22s]  I'm going to have to go get some water.
[20201.22s -> 20205.87s]  And then we're going to we're going to have to just kind of chill.
[20205.87s -> 20210.77s]  This is where I tap out at six hours.
[20210.77s -> 20213.77s]  I've punched the air probably six to seven thousand times.
[20213.77s -> 20226.04s]  This is so fun though.
[20226.04s -> 20228.86s]  This is supposed to be a 12 hour stream.
[20228.86s -> 20234.04s]  No way.
[20234.04s -> 20245.58s]  If I don't get like in the shower in the next like 40 minutes, you will see a guy pass out on stream.
[20245.58s -> 20246.58s]  Shred the chair.
[20246.58s -> 20247.58s]  Why would I shred my chair?
[20247.58s -> 20248.58s]  I love my chair.
[20248.58s -> 20254.07s]  It's a great chair.
[20254.07s -> 20256.88s]  So here's the here's the plan.
[20256.88s -> 20258.88s]  These these games are really, really fun.
[20258.88s -> 20264.25s]  And I spent more time in some of them than I thought, which I knew was probably the case.
[20264.25s -> 20271.84s]  There are a couple of really, really great ones still.
[20271.84s -> 20273.84s]  There's like 10 that are still around.
[20273.84s -> 20279.48s]  So we're going to do another.
[20279.48s -> 20281.48s]  We're just going to do more Connect.
[20281.48s -> 20283.48s]  We're just going to not now.
[20283.48s -> 20285.48s]  Not this week.
[20285.48s -> 20290.48s]  We're going to put it in the box till next week because Ancestors comes out on Tuesday.
[20290.48s -> 20292.48s]  And that's what I want to do next.
[20292.48s -> 20297.70s]  That evolution ape game.
[20297.70s -> 20300.70s]  It seems really, really just ridiculous.
[20300.70s -> 20302.70s]  I'm going to play that for probably a day or so.
[20302.70s -> 20313.28s]  We're going to start the next Connect stream with Rise of Nightmares because that is absolutely going to be like a two to three hour experience.
[20313.28s -> 20321.00s]  At least it's a full game.
[20321.00s -> 20327.66s]  So we'll probably actually do that this coming weekend because let me think about this.
[20327.66s -> 20329.66s]  So Tuesday, I'm going to Ancestors.
[20329.66s -> 20335.16s]  And then maybe we could do Thursday or Friday.
[20335.16s -> 20337.85s]  Maybe because Saturday we're doing upset.
[20337.85s -> 20339.85s]  We're finishing Terraria on Saturday.
[20339.85s -> 20341.85s]  Star and I were going to do the base game.
[20341.85s -> 20342.85s]  We're going to complete it.
[20342.85s -> 20350.79s]  So I don't maybe like Sunday.
[20350.79s -> 20355.79s]  We'll do like a horror thing on Sunday because this two horror games for the Connect that I'm going to do.
[20355.79s -> 20359.09s]  Haunt and then Rise of Nightmares.
[20359.09s -> 20361.72s]  They both apparently really interesting.
[20361.72s -> 20364.40s]  So but I got some water.
[20364.40s -> 20366.40s]  I got a clock out here.
[20366.40s -> 20367.90s]  We'll come back.
[20367.90s -> 20368.90s]  I'll hang up for a little bit.
[20368.90s -> 20369.90s]  We'll do the bits.
[20369.90s -> 20371.40s]  We'll talk.
[20371.40s -> 20376.36s]  We'll probably be done in about six, six and a half hours or so.
[20376.36s -> 20377.36s]  So I will see you guys.
[20377.36s -> 20378.36s]  Have you taken off?
[20378.36s -> 20384.20s]  I'll see you guys on Tuesday for Ancestors.
[20384.20s -> 20388.36s]  That's the day it launches on PC.
[20388.36s -> 20389.36s]  I'll be right back.
[20389.36s -> 20391.86s]  I'm going to get some water.
[20391.86s -> 20522.96s]  All right.
[20522.96s -> 20528.44s]  So again, if you're sticking around, I will see you on Tuesday.
[20528.44s -> 20530.76s]  Today's Sunday.
[20530.76s -> 20532.76s]  So I won't be streaming tomorrow.
[20532.76s -> 20533.76s]  I'll see you on Tuesday.
[20533.76s -> 20539.52s]  The stream was shorter than I expected.
[20539.52s -> 20540.52s]  I drank a battery for no reason.
[20540.52s -> 20542.52s]  Why would you ever have a battery for lunch?
[20542.52s -> 20546.64s]  I'll do that.
[20546.64s -> 20547.64s]  That's a bad idea.
[20547.64s -> 20553.16s]  That's that I would advise against ever doing something like that.
[20553.16s -> 20560.46s]  So let's do the bits.
[20560.46s -> 20564.04s]  Last stream before school starts again for a lot of guys.
[20564.04s -> 20565.04s]  Well, good luck.
[20565.04s -> 20570.48s]  You still get your weekends and just work hard and make sure you get your schoolwork done.
[20570.48s -> 20578.36s]  Did the Ancestors team say how far along the game is for the demo?
[20578.36s -> 20580.54s]  Wait, it's not coming out.
[20580.54s -> 20585.60s]  You don't stream on weekends.
[20585.60s -> 20587.86s]  What's today?
[20587.86s -> 20590.48s]  And what was yesterday?
[20590.48s -> 20593.84s]  Was yesterday Thursday?
[20593.84s -> 20595.84s]  What's what's today?
[20595.84s -> 20597.01s]  Saturday and Sunday.
[20597.01s -> 20598.01s]  Huh?
[20598.01s -> 20599.44s]  What's happening here?
[20599.44s -> 20605.84s]  What is this backpack thing?
[20605.84s -> 20607.84s]  I see this backpack every day.
[20607.84s -> 20608.84s]  So wait, hold on.
[20608.84s -> 20614.16s]  Can somebody clarify this with me?
[20614.16s -> 20618.16s]  Is Ancestors not releasing on Tuesday for PC?
[20618.16s -> 20619.16s]  The one with the apes.
[20619.16s -> 20632.17s]  It's at 2020.
[20632.17s -> 20639.72s]  But that's a console, though, because it comes out a few months after the PC release.
[20639.72s -> 20641.72s]  And I think it's on the Epic Games Store.
[20641.72s -> 20642.72s]  I don't think it's a Steam thing.
[20642.72s -> 20643.72s]  Yeah.
[20643.72s -> 20647.40s]  Yeah, release release date August 27th, 2019.
[20647.40s -> 20649.40s]  It's a demo.
[20649.40s -> 20651.03s]  The Steam page says 2020.
[20651.03s -> 20653.03s]  Well, I think it's because Epic Games Store.
[20653.03s -> 20660.22s]  All right.
[20660.22s -> 20665.72s]  So I'm going to look into that because hopefully it's not just a demo on the 27th.
[20665.72s -> 20669.45s]  Feeling sore or tired?
[20669.45s -> 20670.45s]  Take a break.
[20670.45s -> 20671.45s]  Connect.
[20671.45s -> 20673.97s]  I am.
[20673.97s -> 20674.97s]  So it's a full game.
[20674.97s -> 20675.97s]  That's wet strength.
[20675.97s -> 20676.97s]  That's weird.
[20676.97s -> 20682.97s]  So they're releasing exclusively on the Epic Games Store for PC only on the 27th.
[20682.97s -> 20686.97s]  And then a couple of months later, it's going to consoles.
[20686.97s -> 20689.97s]  And then a month or two later, after that, it's going to steam.
[20689.97s -> 20691.97s]  That seems like a very odd release schedule.
[20691.97s -> 20696.16s]  I don't know.
[20696.16s -> 20697.16s]  That's weird.
[20697.16s -> 20700.29s]  But I guess whatever.
[20700.29s -> 20706.69s]  But thank you, everybody, for watching.
[20706.69s -> 20708.32s]  I'm going to go.
[20708.32s -> 20709.32s]  You know what I need to do?
[20709.32s -> 20710.32s]  I need to take a bath.
[20710.32s -> 20717.08s]  I have this part in the middle of my spine right now.
[20717.08s -> 20718.08s]  And you know what I think happened?
[20718.08s -> 20720.08s]  It happened when I did the break dancing move.
[20720.08s -> 20724.08s]  When I did like in the Power Rangers game, I did the break dancing move.
[20724.08s -> 20727.57s]  And like I tweaked my spine.
[20727.57s -> 20729.32s]  I'm doing I'm fine though.
[20729.32s -> 20731.32s]  I just need to soak for like 20 minutes.
[20731.32s -> 20736.08s]  Get some epsom salts.
[20736.08s -> 20739.08s]  Yeah, that's a super old person thing, but I'll do it.
[20739.08s -> 20743.03s]  But let's go back to earlier today.
[20743.03s -> 20748.97s]  Oh, by the way, another important thing for the community nights, the monthly community nights.
[20748.97s -> 20759.56s]  We are I just gave a huge list of things to all the mods about the channel and the discord that's going to open up.
[20759.56s -> 20768.44s]  So probably somewhere around next weekend or maybe maybe even by the time I stream next in like a few days, there's going to be a new channel in the discord.
[20768.44s -> 20781.38s]  In that channel will be kind of like the recommended channel where you put in there a piece of artwork, a song, a video that's related to the channel somehow.
[20781.38s -> 20787.38s]  I have a whole huge thing of rules that eventually will get pinned and posted somewhere in that channel.
[20787.38s -> 20797.56s]  So in once a month, instead of doing this thing at the end of streams where I put on artwork or video that somebody made, because let's face it, I said this last night, but I'll say it again.
[20797.56s -> 20800.56s]  Just because probably a lot of people that weren't here yesterday.
[20800.56s -> 20807.05s]  When the stream ends and this screen goes on, most people will just kind of leave the stream.
[20807.05s -> 20814.05s]  I mean, not most, but it's usually around like 50 to 60 percent will just kind of be like, all right, see, let us see you next time.
[20814.05s -> 20819.05s]  Right. So they don't get to see some of these awesome videos that we show here.
[20819.05s -> 20825.94s]  So I mean, I guess that is most. Yeah, I guess it is.
[20825.94s -> 20829.14s]  And there's been so many great videos.
[20829.14s -> 20836.89s]  Think about the videos. Think about the artwork that has been shown here that a lot of people, maybe they might think it was cool.
[20836.89s -> 20849.13s]  I think it was interesting. So I figured we'll do like a little radio show thing where once a month we sit down for a few hours and we just go over all the cool community content that people make in one place at one time.
[20849.13s -> 20854.40s]  And everybody knows that's what the function is rather than for the bits.
[20854.40s -> 20859.70s]  It's hey, it's the bits. And also, here's a really cool piece of artwork, don't you think?
[20859.70s -> 20875.00s]  I think it's better that way. That's what I think. It should be interesting to do.
[20875.00s -> 20881.49s]  But let's move on. I just want to make sure I clarify that that is coming probably in the next three to five days.
[20881.49s -> 20885.80s]  Keep an eye on the Discord. If you're not part of the Discord, join it.
[20885.80s -> 20896.63s]  It's open to the public. Anybody can be a part of it, but it's not just going to be for artwork.
[20896.63s -> 20903.39s]  It will be for everything. Everything that is related.
[20903.39s -> 20916.82s]  Like one of the things I put in a pin or that I put in the post that I made into the mods was, I mean, if you put like Gordon Ramsay saying fuck off 10 times in a compilation, that is not like a community piece of content.
[20916.82s -> 20920.00s]  It's just Gordon Ramsay saying fuck off like 10 times.
[20920.00s -> 20927.30s]  If it's somehow related to a game or a stream or a thing or a joke or something like that.
[20927.30s -> 20942.43s]  That's very specific. But I'm just saying, I don't want you to link in that Discord like your favorite YouTube video.
[20942.43s -> 20947.50s]  That's not the purpose of these nights. Because it's only going to be probably two or three hours.
[20947.50s -> 20955.64s]  And I want to keep that reserved for like community content.
[20955.64s -> 20961.64s]  I mean, if you edit me into a Gordon Ramsay fucking taste test where he tells me to fuck off, there you go.
[20961.64s -> 20965.78s]  What a narcissist I am. I have to be in it.
[20965.78s -> 20978.32s]  But thank you. Thank you to Chris Buck365 for the four dollars. Thank you. Appreciate it.
[20978.32s -> 20987.62s]  Gnarly thanks to the 250. Have you ever considered representing games you played on a main channel video for a stream? Games like Raven's Cry, Total Distortion, or I Am Alive.
[20987.62s -> 20994.97s]  Maybe as a compilation like these Kinect games would be fun. Total Distortion I think would be really cool.
[20994.97s -> 20998.97s]  Total Distortion is hard to get to run and to capture though.
[20998.97s -> 21004.53s]  All those old games are so difficult because they're barely even DirectX.
[21004.53s -> 21010.72s]  You have to capture a whole monitor. The things in like 480 by fucking 160.
[21010.72s -> 21019.68s]  It's hell to get those to capture through a capture device.
[21019.68s -> 21026.65s]  Oh, there's no music. Sorry.
[21026.65s -> 21030.02s]  They're tiny weird resolutions.
[21030.02s -> 21035.02s]  I think Total Distortion is actually Flash or Adobe Director or something.
[21035.02s -> 21038.02s]  It's not even a 3D engine.
[21038.02s -> 21046.19s]  I've used a virtual machine before, but I'd have to really would set that up.
[21046.19s -> 21052.43s]  I think I've actually used a virtual machine for recording and video streaming purposes.
[21052.43s -> 21062.22s]  I believe I did Windows 95, 98. Just point your webcam at it.
[21062.22s -> 21064.22s]  Yeah, that's I could do that too.
[21064.22s -> 21067.22s]  But yes, I absolutely have thought about it before.
[21067.22s -> 21077.18s]  I mean, Super Mario RPG is going to be done next week.
[21080.08s -> 21084.08s]  $50 came in 10 minutes ago. I was not here for it.
[21084.08s -> 21088.08s]  But thank you Killer Crocomire for the 5,000 bits.
[21088.08s -> 21093.48s]  We all know Sam and Max is coming back, right chat?
[21093.48s -> 21102.96s]  Yeah. Yeah, I played the first episode and then a lot of people started to lose interest.
[21102.96s -> 21104.96s]  I kind of started to lose interest too.
[21104.96s -> 21110.96s]  Something about that third season, the first episode didn't pull me like the first two seasons did.
[21110.96s -> 21116.40s]  I'm still going to finish it because I'm not going to start episode one on the final season and not do it.
[21116.40s -> 21121.96s]  But it didn't pull. It didn't grab me like the other two seasons did.
[21121.96s -> 21123.96s]  Something was something about it. I don't know what it was.
[21123.96s -> 21132.49s]  But thank you Killer Crocomire for the 50 bucks, 5,000 bits.
[21132.49s -> 21144.94s]  You'll see it again. Maybe to maybe next week will just be we'll do Sam and Max Super Mario RPG and we'll connect.
[21144.94s -> 21161.24s]  It makes sense, I think. But yeah, thank you to Elizabeth for the 250.
[21161.24s -> 21166.68s]  In honor of playing Star Wars on stream, I'm bringing back this classic. Is this the Han Solo song?
[21166.68s -> 21177.24s]  Han Solo? I five-starred that on Expert. Were you here for that?
[21177.24s -> 21186.90s]  Jeremy is a Jedi Master? What the hell is this? Why can I not hear it?
[21186.90s -> 21188.90s]  Oh, it's good. This is pulled out.
[21188.90s -> 21195.47s]  This classic? What is it? This classic?
[21205.14s -> 21207.14s]  No, let's see if we can't figure out what you are.
[21207.14s -> 21209.14s]  So that was the Han Solo song.
[21209.14s -> 21211.14s]  And where you come from.
[21211.14s -> 21215.53s]  Oh, it's the hologram video.
[21215.53s -> 21220.88s]  Oh, this is from one of the green screen nights.
[21220.88s -> 21231.12s]  That is a classic. You're right.
[21231.12s -> 21244.84s]  That thumbnail. Yeah, what is it? Shrek?
[21244.84s -> 21246.84s]  What is that thumbnail? What does that have to do with the video?
[21246.84s -> 21251.38s]  I saw it for two seconds.
[21251.38s -> 21268.08s]  Is that the Green Goblin?
[21268.08s -> 21270.64s]  Shrek? I don't know. Who is that?
[21270.64s -> 21274.85s]  Purple underwear?
[21274.85s -> 21277.48s]  Why am I looking at that for so long?
[21277.48s -> 21281.91s]  Alright. It's the Hulk. The Hulk. The Hulk. Okay. You're right. You're right. You're right.
[21281.91s -> 21286.52s]  The Green Goblin.
[21286.52s -> 21288.52s]  Runs around in purple underwear.
[21288.52s -> 21293.00s]  I'm tired. I'm sorry.
[21303.71s -> 21305.71s]  I need to put this on screen.
[21305.71s -> 21307.71s]  This is spot the difference.
[21307.71s -> 21311.42s]  This is from C4G.
[21311.42s -> 21316.99s]  I have to put this on.
[21316.99s -> 21318.99s]  Thank you C4G for the 250.
[21318.99s -> 21333.88s]  Thank you.
[21333.88s -> 21336.81s]  I don't see any difference.
[21336.81s -> 21338.81s]  Thank you Marvash Magali for the 250.
[21338.81s -> 21340.81s]  Half of these Kinect games are just fever dreams.
[21340.81s -> 21342.81s]  Thanks for the super early stream from Italy.
[21342.81s -> 21344.81s]  You're welcome. Absolutely.
[21344.81s -> 21351.72s]  Trying to pull the streams back an hour or two.
[21351.72s -> 21353.72s]  Slowly.
[21353.72s -> 21356.03s]  Over time.
[21356.03s -> 21362.24s]  Trying to stick to that.
[21362.24s -> 21364.24s]  So you'll be seeing earlier streams in the future as well.
[21364.24s -> 21368.40s]  Thank you Elizabeth for the 250.
[21368.40s -> 21370.40s]  I will electrocute you is my favorite quote
[21370.40s -> 21373.79s]  from the Emperor by the way.
[21373.79s -> 21375.79s]  Now we're talking about Ravenous Throat, right?
[21375.79s -> 21380.46s]  Oh yeah.
[21380.46s -> 21382.46s]  I had a lot of shit to say about Star Wars today, didn't I?
[21382.46s -> 21388.27s]  ChunkyBologna gave
[21388.27s -> 21390.27s]  $50 and 20 subs
[21390.27s -> 21392.27s]  earlier. Thank you.
[21392.27s -> 21394.64s]  That is a lot. That's a shitload of money.
[21394.64s -> 21398.67s]  Bitslave also gave
[21398.67s -> 21400.67s]  a ton of subs and
[21400.67s -> 21402.67s]  $50 and 45 cents.
[21402.67s -> 21407.60s]  Thank you.
[21407.60s -> 21410.09s]  And they say, hey German, not sure if you remember me,
[21410.09s -> 21412.09s]  but I used to watch your streams all the time
[21412.09s -> 21414.09s]  and donate like 25 cents all the time.
[21414.09s -> 21416.09s]  I have not a lot of free time to watch your streams
[21416.09s -> 21418.09s]  anymore, but I do keep up with the VODs.
[21418.09s -> 21420.09s]  Thanks for all the great content over the years.
[21420.09s -> 21422.09s]  PSD still have that picture of my dad and I
[21422.09s -> 21424.09s]  on your computer.
[21424.09s -> 21426.09s]  I do not. I do not because I have formatted
[21426.09s -> 21428.09s]  my hard drive since then.
[21428.09s -> 21432.19s]  They're talking about
[21432.19s -> 21434.19s]  this plane, right?
[21434.19s -> 21436.19s]  I do remember this. Yep, it's airplane
[21436.19s -> 21438.19s]  you and dad in front of the airplane.
[21438.19s -> 21441.20s]  I do remember that.
[21441.20s -> 21443.20s]  So yes, I remember you.
[21443.20s -> 21449.58s]  But yeah,
[21449.58s -> 21451.58s]  thanks for coming back.
[21451.58s -> 21453.58s]  I hope you're doing well.
[21453.58s -> 21457.68s]  Thanks for the huge amount of subs
[21457.68s -> 21459.68s]  that you dropped in. Thanks for the $50 and 45
[21459.68s -> 21463.52s]  cents. Appreciate it.
[21463.52s -> 21466.65s]  And then they gave five more dollars. They said five
[21466.65s -> 21468.65s]  dollars more for the next BitBadge.
[21468.65s -> 21473.44s]  There you go. Thank you, Bitslake.
[21473.44s -> 21477.08s]  Welcome back.
[21477.08s -> 21482.46s]  Let's get the credits on.
[21482.46s -> 21485.53s]  Here they come. These are all the subs.
[21485.53s -> 21488.03s]  All the new
[21488.03s -> 21490.03s]  old resubs, community subs, everybody.
[21490.03s -> 21493.72s]  I think they
[21493.72s -> 21495.72s]  should be showing up very shortly.
[21495.72s -> 21499.05s]  There they are. Thank you, all of you
[21499.05s -> 21504.94s]  again. All
[21504.94s -> 21506.94s]  16,500
[21506.94s -> 21508.94s]  of you. Just kidding. I don't have that
[21508.94s -> 21512.65s]  many subs. But man, it feels like it
[21512.65s -> 21515.21s]  sometimes. Thank you guys, for
[21515.21s -> 21525.71s]  real. Really appreciate it.
[21525.71s -> 21532.81s]  Thank you, Master Chicken for the five dollars.
[21532.81s -> 21534.81s]  Probably gonna get tired.
[21534.81s -> 21536.81s]  Probably gonna get fired from work because of my prescription
[21536.81s -> 21538.81s]  medication. Coming home being able to
[21538.81s -> 21540.81s]  watch this stream is making my day more bearable.
[21540.81s -> 21544.97s]  I'm not sure what you
[21544.97s -> 21546.97s]  mean by that, but
[21546.97s -> 21548.97s]  I'm really sorry to hear that. That sucks.
[21548.97s -> 21557.68s]  That's not cool. Hopefully
[21557.68s -> 21564.46s]  you get that sorted out. I'd probably
[21564.46s -> 21566.46s]  figure out if that's, you know,
[21566.46s -> 21568.46s]  you got rights as a worker, you know.
[21568.46s -> 21576.27s]  But hopefully you can figure out
[21576.27s -> 21578.27s]  whatever's going on there. I'm really sorry to hear
[21578.27s -> 21584.67s]  that you're having trouble there. But thanks
[21584.67s -> 21586.67s]  for sticking around here. Thanks for watching.
[21586.67s -> 21588.67s]  Thanks for the five dollars. Appreciate it.
[21588.67s -> 21597.18s]  Yeah, good luck. Best of luck to you.
[21597.18s -> 21603.77s]  Thank you, Bitslay for the five dollars.
[21603.77s -> 21607.48s]  They say, look at this burger I got
[21607.48s -> 21609.48s]  from McDonald's. What are you doing?
[21609.48s -> 21611.48s]  That looks disgusting.
[21611.48s -> 21614.62s]  Why did you
[21614.62s -> 21616.62s]  Why did you do
[21616.62s -> 21618.62s]  Are you watching this in like a Facebook
[21618.62s -> 21621.12s]  browser? This is freaking
[21621.12s -> 21625.21s]  me out. This is freaking me
[21625.21s -> 21627.21s]  out. Why did you give me this?
[21627.21s -> 21638.78s]  Is that a burger?
[21638.78s -> 21645.12s]  Hold on. What the hell is this?
[21649.40s -> 21651.40s]  You got that from McDonald's?
[21651.40s -> 21653.40s]  Why are you giving
[21653.40s -> 21656.28s]  this to me?
[21656.28s -> 21658.28s]  That looks like a
[21658.28s -> 21660.28s]  puppet. It looks like a mouth and a
[21660.28s -> 21662.28s]  mustache. That looks like the Pringles
[21662.28s -> 21664.28s]  guy without his eyes.
[21664.28s -> 21666.28s]  What did you do to the Pringles guy?
[21683.88s -> 21685.88s]  I would
[21685.88s -> 21687.88s]  still eat that too. That actually looks kind of good.
[21687.88s -> 21689.88s]  Except for that weird booger
[21689.88s -> 21691.88s]  that's on the left of it. Whatever that is. Like a piece
[21691.88s -> 21694.32s]  of onion. Well, thank you.
[21694.32s -> 21699.95s]  Thanks for that.
[21699.95s -> 21701.95s]  Wasn't that B on your tier list? No, it wasn't.
[21701.95s -> 21704.44s]  No way.
[21704.44s -> 21711.36s]  McDonald's was on B.
[21711.36s -> 21714.56s]  It was like a C-. But thank you for that.
[21714.56s -> 21716.56s]  Bitslay, appreciate it.
[21716.56s -> 21719.69s]  Thanks for the burger. Silent Serenity, thanks
[21719.69s -> 21721.69s]  for the two fifty. Psychopath Stream
[21721.69s -> 21723.69s]  alters the DNA of his dog
[21723.69s -> 21726.70s]  in his garage. Hello,
[21726.70s -> 21729.13s]  Lizard. But I do get the point.
[21729.13s -> 21731.13s]  Thank you for the two fifty.
[21731.13s -> 21734.20s]  Thank you. Errorless for the two fifty. You should
[21734.20s -> 21736.20s]  dastardly make a Jerma plus two emote
[21736.20s -> 21738.20s]  and only a Jerma plus two emote.
[21738.20s -> 21740.20s]  Not a minus two.
[21740.20s -> 21743.90s]  That's not a bad idea.
[21743.90s -> 21748.38s]  You really game the system there.
[21748.38s -> 21750.38s]  I don't even like Taco Bell thanks to the two dollars and fifty
[21750.38s -> 21752.38s]  cents. Jerma, you look like
[21752.38s -> 21754.38s]  the over enthusiastic instructor at a
[21754.38s -> 21756.38s]  rock climbing summer camp.
[21756.38s -> 21770.14s]  Yeah, okay. Yeah. I'll take
[21770.14s -> 21772.14s]  that one. Thank you. S10W update
[21772.14s -> 21774.14s]  for the two fifty. Hey, Jerma, I want to say I'm happy to support
[21774.14s -> 21776.14s]  you. Unfortunately, I live in Canada
[21776.14s -> 21778.14s]  and I have to pay double for bits.
[21778.14s -> 21780.14s]  Five hundred bits is ten dollars.
[21780.14s -> 21782.64s]  That sounds
[21782.64s -> 21784.64s]  ridiculous. So I can't do this often,
[21784.64s -> 21786.64s]  but I want to let you know that I'll support you no matter what the cost.
[21786.64s -> 21788.64s]  Peace and love. Also congrats on
[21788.64s -> 21790.64s]  being the number one Kinect streamer.
[21790.64s -> 21792.64s]  Happy to hear that this is what you'll be
[21792.64s -> 21796.41s]  known for. I was also
[21796.41s -> 21798.41s]  the number one house flipper streamer, number one
[21798.41s -> 21801.23s]  Labo streamer, number one
[21801.23s -> 21803.47s]  birdhouse streamer. I have
[21803.47s -> 21805.47s]  quite a few accolades, so
[21805.47s -> 21817.74s]  I'll take it.
[21817.74s -> 21819.74s]  Thank you, though, and don't worry about ever paying
[21819.74s -> 21821.74s]  money if you get
[21821.74s -> 21823.74s]  destroyed on
[21823.74s -> 21825.74s]  currency change there.
[21825.74s -> 21828.62s]  You hanging out and watching is
[21828.62s -> 21830.62s]  way more important, so thank you, though.
[21830.62s -> 21833.31s]  I appreciate it.
[21833.31s -> 21835.31s]  Very good.
[21835.31s -> 21837.31s]  Thanks for the, I wasn't supposed to read
[21837.31s -> 21839.93s]  this one. This one's
[21839.93s -> 21841.93s]  not, this one's below the threshold.
[21841.93s -> 21843.93s]  What am I doing reading it?
[21843.93s -> 21850.40s]  They actually say whoever reads this is
[21850.40s -> 21856.65s]  cute. I did.
[21856.65s -> 21858.65s]  It's time for slime thanks to the three dollars. Community nights is
[21858.65s -> 21862.30s]  a nice idea. I'm excited for it.
[21862.30s -> 21864.30s]  It'll be a lot like this, without
[21864.30s -> 21866.30s]  the stream over screen. Probably
[21866.30s -> 21868.30s]  on face cam.
[21868.30s -> 21870.92s]  Hanging out. Just chilling.
[21870.92s -> 21878.22s]  Going over stuff. More
[21878.22s -> 21882.70s]  concentrated. What is it
[21882.70s -> 21884.70s]  gonna be? Uh, the
[21884.70s -> 21886.70s]  channel for
[21886.70s -> 21888.70s]  submissions will be up
[21888.70s -> 21890.70s]  in the discord probably this coming weekend.
[21890.70s -> 21892.70s]  So, like, next weekend. Next, like, Saturday
[21892.70s -> 21894.94s]  or Sunday. And then after that
[21894.94s -> 21896.94s]  probably maybe get a week of the
[21896.94s -> 21898.94s]  submissions. I still also have to talk about the
[21898.94s -> 21900.94s]  activity book stream, which I'm gonna do before I play
[21900.94s -> 21905.93s]  Ancestors on Tuesday.
[21905.93s -> 21909.58s]  That's the plan. We also have
[21909.58s -> 21911.58s]  a 250 from Jay Bong.
[21911.58s -> 21913.58s]  Hey Jay, haven't been able to catch a stream
[21913.58s -> 21915.58s]  in over two months because I was visiting
[21915.58s -> 21917.58s]  family in Vietnam.
[21917.58s -> 21919.58s]  Glad to be back. Also, has Kim ever taught
[21919.58s -> 21922.08s]  you any Vietnamese?
[21922.08s -> 21925.60s]  Welcome back. Thanks for the 250.
[21925.60s -> 21927.60s]  And yes, I have
[21927.60s -> 21929.84s]  been...
[21929.84s -> 21931.84s]  She's tried. I'm a very slow learner.
[21931.84s -> 21934.91s]  I know how to say... I think I'm gonna try.
[21934.91s -> 21936.91s]  I'm gonna say this. I don't know what I'm... I think
[21936.91s -> 21938.91s]  Anca Sao Hong.
[21938.91s -> 21940.91s]  I believe that means I...
[21940.91s -> 21943.47s]  Something Sao Hong
[21943.47s -> 21945.47s]  Anca Sao Hong
[21945.47s -> 21951.16s]  doesn't that mean...
[21951.16s -> 21953.16s]  What's that mean? That means, like, I'm your friend
[21953.16s -> 21955.16s]  or I'm your brother, father?
[21955.16s -> 21959.77s]  What did I just say?
[21959.77s -> 21964.06s]  I am your, like, brother or something.
[21964.06s -> 21966.49s]  Are you okay, dear?
[21966.49s -> 21968.49s]  Right?
[21968.49s -> 21970.49s]  No, I just asked, how are you?
[21970.49s -> 21972.49s]  That's what I said. I said, how are you?
[21972.49s -> 21976.91s]  Like, are you okay? How are you doing?
[21976.91s -> 21978.91s]  I am your
[21978.91s -> 21980.91s]  father. How are you?
[21980.91s -> 21982.91s]  Wow, how wildly different
[21982.91s -> 21984.91s]  that was. At least I said it.
[21984.91s -> 21991.95s]  Are you
[21991.95s -> 21993.95s]  alright? I am your father.
[21993.95s -> 21995.95s]  I played too much Star Wars today.
[21995.95s -> 21999.26s]  That's the problem.
[21999.26s -> 22001.88s]  But, yes,
[22001.88s -> 22003.88s]  we have... She's tried to teach me a few things.
[22003.88s -> 22011.50s]  Thank you
[22011.50s -> 22013.93s]  Dsoid
[22013.93s -> 22015.93s]  KajPDFJA
[22015.93s -> 22017.93s]  Thanks for the four dolls. Thanks for the stream, Jerma.
[22017.93s -> 22019.93s]  Thanks for the four dolls. Thanks for watching.
[22019.93s -> 22022.92s]  You rock.
[22022.92s -> 22025.36s]  Thank you for four dolls. At the very end
[22025.36s -> 22027.36s]  we had 250 from Future
[22027.36s -> 22029.60s]  Gamer. Been watching
[22029.60s -> 22031.60s]  since middle school. Now I'm starting college.
[22031.60s -> 22035.31s]  Any tips for college?
[22035.31s -> 22037.31s]  Good luck at college. Thanks for the 250.
[22037.31s -> 22041.02s]  And yeah, I do.
[22041.02s -> 22043.02s]  If you can... I mean, this is just
[22043.02s -> 22045.02s]  from my personal experience.
[22045.02s -> 22047.88s]  You can take
[22047.88s -> 22049.88s]  day classes or night classes.
[22049.88s -> 22052.19s]  I'm not sure if you signed up for classes already.
[22052.19s -> 22055.84s]  But in the future,
[22055.84s -> 22057.84s]  I always did so much better
[22057.84s -> 22059.84s]  on night classes.
[22059.84s -> 22061.84s]  You had your whole day already
[22061.84s -> 22063.84s]  signed up. Alright, well for the next semester,
[22063.84s -> 22065.84s]  it depends if you're a morning person, that's good.
[22065.84s -> 22068.14s]  But for me, night classes
[22068.14s -> 22071.34s]  gave me the whole day.
[22071.34s -> 22073.34s]  I could sleep in, I wasn't rushing in the morning,
[22073.34s -> 22075.34s]  and I could get up, take a shower, get some food,
[22075.34s -> 22077.34s]  and was able to go to class
[22077.34s -> 22079.34s]  later. That was
[22079.34s -> 22081.34s]  really, really helpful for me.
[22081.34s -> 22084.09s]  But in regards
[22084.09s -> 22086.52s]  to just general advice,
[22086.52s -> 22088.70s]  yeah.
[22088.70s -> 22093.31s]  Take it easy. You don't gotta be the best.
[22093.31s -> 22099.05s]  Do your best.
[22099.05s -> 22101.05s]  Fuck. I just said the same thing opposite.
[22101.05s -> 22103.29s]  Listen.
[22106.36s -> 22108.36s]  Okay. You don't have to
[22108.36s -> 22110.67s]  be the best. Just
[22110.67s -> 22112.67s]  do what you can as
[22112.67s -> 22114.84s]  well as you know how.
[22114.84s -> 22120.54s]  Alright.
[22120.54s -> 22122.54s]  Slam fucking beer
[22122.54s -> 22124.54s]  and scream.
[22124.54s -> 22136.96s]  Don't do that either. You'll do the best
[22136.96s -> 22138.96s]  in college. You know what? You know what I'll
[22138.96s -> 22140.96s]  tell you? The real advice for college, the
[22140.96s -> 22142.96s]  real advice, it's not
[22142.96s -> 22145.26s]  get a 4.0.
[22145.26s -> 22147.69s]  It's try to make some friends.
[22147.69s -> 22149.69s]  Because everybody's starting at the same point.
[22149.69s -> 22152.19s]  And as much as you
[22152.19s -> 22154.19s]  don't think so, everybody else
[22154.19s -> 22156.19s]  is thinking the same thing that you are.
[22156.19s -> 22160.60s]  This is new.
[22160.60s -> 22163.04s]  It's a little nerve wracking.
[22163.04s -> 22165.04s]  And making friends is actually a little bit
[22165.04s -> 22167.04s]  easier in college.
[22167.04s -> 22169.04s]  Because everyone is on that same playing
[22169.04s -> 22172.62s]  field. You also
[22172.62s -> 22174.62s]  start over essentially in college.
[22174.62s -> 22178.40s]  And find people that share the same
[22178.40s -> 22180.40s]  interest as you, and try to
[22180.40s -> 22182.40s]  make some friends. Makes things a lot
[22182.40s -> 22184.40s]  easier, a lot more smooth.
[22184.40s -> 22196.43s]  High school is more clicky, but college is
[22196.43s -> 22198.43s]  easier to find people with similar interests.
[22198.43s -> 22200.43s]  Absolutely, because for the most part, if you're
[22200.43s -> 22202.43s]  in a major, let's say you're majoring
[22202.43s -> 22204.43s]  in, let's say you're majoring
[22204.43s -> 22206.43s]  in engineering or something.
[22206.43s -> 22208.43s]  I'm studying, or communications.
[22208.43s -> 22210.43s]  I'm learning how to do film, tv,
[22210.43s -> 22212.43s]  radio. The people in your
[22212.43s -> 22214.43s]  classes also think that stuff is cool.
[22214.43s -> 22217.05s]  That's why they're there.
[22217.05s -> 22219.05s]  I want to be a business student. I want to be a
[22219.05s -> 22221.05s]  teacher.
[22221.05s -> 22223.42s]  If you want to be a teacher,
[22223.42s -> 22225.42s]  all the people in your classes
[22225.42s -> 22227.60s]  all want to be teachers.
[22227.60s -> 22236.30s]  You have something in common already.
[22236.30s -> 22238.30s]  You went to college 10 years ago, or something.
[22238.30s -> 22240.30s]  Yeah. It's been a very
[22240.30s -> 22249.58s]  long time. Did you learn anything
[22249.58s -> 22251.58s]  from communications related to streaming?
[22251.58s -> 22253.58s]  No. It was not a thing.
[22253.58s -> 22255.88s]  Live, broadcasted
[22255.88s -> 22257.88s]  video from a computer was not
[22257.88s -> 22259.88s]  something that we were doing.
[22259.88s -> 22261.88s]  We were still using tapes.
[22261.88s -> 22269.37s]  But I wish you the best of luck. Just take it
[22269.37s -> 22278.33s]  easy, take it slow,
[22278.33s -> 22281.92s]  and good luck. Everybody's there doing
[22281.92s -> 22285.95s]  the same thing. And with that,
[22285.95s -> 22288.96s]  I will
[22288.96s -> 22290.96s]  see you
[22290.96s -> 22293.82s]  Tuesday.
[22293.82s -> 22296.83s]  For Ancestors,
[22296.83s -> 22301.63s]  the Evolution game.
[22301.63s -> 22304.76s]  See you real soon. Have a wonderful
[22304.76s -> 22306.94s]  rest of your night. See you guys
[22306.94s -> 22310.01s]  Tuesday. Probably going to start Tuesday
[22310.01s -> 22312.57s]  at the normal time. So don't
[22312.57s -> 22314.57s]  plan on a 12 to 1
[22314.57s -> 22316.57s]  PM start. Somewhere around
[22316.57s -> 22319.45s]  3 or 4.
[22319.45s -> 22322.52s]  Goodbye. Take care.
[22322.52s -> 22325.79s]  Good rest of your night.
[22325.79s -> 22343.37s]  Bye. And for those of you that thought that was a little
[22343.37s -> 22345.37s]  too creepy, goodbye.
[22345.37s -> 22347.37s]  Have a great day. See? I
[22347.37s -> 22349.37s]  can do both.
