[0.38s -> 64.17s]  Hello. Hold on. And I had to tweet too. I had to tweet that out. That we're playing Patapon.
[64.89s -> 76.58s]  Hello, good afternoon. How's your day going? Is it going good? Good. He's a social media mogul.
[78.54s -> 86.68s]  Can't wait for social media tycoon. Started zero likes. Can you get up to 500,000 followers?
[87.48s -> 104.33s]  Does that exist? Does that game exist? It probably does. But yeah, I'm gonna play Patapon 2,
[104.33s -> 109.45s]  actually. Not just Patapon. Patapon 2. In the pre-stream chat, we had a little bit of a
[110.34s -> 120.39s]  vote. And I've been told that Patapon 2 is just a better version of Patapon 1
[121.27s -> 126.90s]  in almost every way. It's just one but better. That's what I've been told. And that's what
[126.90s -> 133.54s]  we're gonna do. Because look, we can always go back into the prequel. But I'm gonna give it a
[133.54s -> 143.34s]  shot. We'll see how it goes. We'll play for a while. See if I like it. New game? Yeah, we did.
[143.34s -> 156.20s]  Gotcha Force. Gotcha Force is dumb. I loved every second of it. Patapon 3 waiting room.
[156.20s -> 161.98s]  I heard Patapon 3 is not very good. Doesn't people say Patapon 3 is the not good one?
[162.78s -> 178.86s]  It's too grindy. Who made this? I saw a Japan studio pop up. What company actually made this?
[185.67s -> 193.06s]  Bungie. I don't know. Bungie didn't make this. Pyramid did. Pyramid Studios.
[193.54s -> 207.56s]  Bungie. They need to make a new Patapon. Am I gonna love this game? We're about to find out.
[207.56s -> 226.87s]  But right now? Am I gonna love this game? Place your bets. It's kind of already doing it for me.
[226.87s -> 242.94s]  Not much time has gone by and I already like it. All right, so let's do a new game. How can
[242.94s -> 254.65s]  I continue nothing? I'm ready. Let's go. As the ship neared completion, Patapon suddenly remembered
[254.65s -> 262.89s]  an old story. Almighty leader, let's sail off into the dark unknown as our search for earthen.
[262.89s -> 269.96s]  I didn't get to read it. Patapons bravely set off on their voyage, leaving behind their loved ones,
[269.96s -> 274.44s]  friends, and the safety of their home island. They braved many violent storms and sweated through
[274.44s -> 279.56s]  many scorching days. It was indeed a long and arduous voyage, but the brave Patapons refused
[279.56s -> 285.70s]  to give up. This is Patapon 1. However, all their suffering was insignificant compared to the trouble
[285.70s -> 291.46s]  they had. Only after 49 days and 49 nights, the Patapons truly learned of the evils that lurked
[291.46s -> 296.10s]  below the depths of the sea. Their fate unknown. What will become of the Patapons now? All right,
[296.10s -> 306.20s]  we just watched the whole, we got the whole story from Patapon 1. Patapon oath. I gotta take this.
[309.13s -> 316.82s]  I, hold on. I hereby pledge to honor and keep my promise to be the great leader of the Patapons
[316.82s -> 322.74s]  and help them reach earthen. I will not stray from my goal, even in the face of death or great
[322.74s -> 328.02s]  peril. Even at moments of weakness, I will keep the beat and feel the rhythm of the earth.
[328.97s -> 333.93s]  From this point forward, I promise to keep my pledge and take this drum of courage and be the
[333.93s -> 343.53s]  mighty leader I was meant to be. This is my oath. Won't you tell us your name, almighty one?
[344.17s -> 351.18s]  Transfer Patapon save data. Tell us your name.
[359.74s -> 389.43s]  Okay, well, okay, you can only do four letters. Welcome to the world of Patapon. Oh, great one.
[389.43s -> 393.11s]  If this is your first time playing, might we recommend you start off in the easy mode? Oh,
[393.11s -> 402.89s]  no. What do I do? Do I say no? Okay, how hard is Patapon? Is this a hard game?
[407.86s -> 417.98s]  No, say yes. Yes. If they laugh, it's extremely hard. Hardest game. Yes, it's hard. Can I,
[417.98s -> 430.57s]  okay, can I change the difficulty whenever I want? No. Can I, I can't change the difficulty.
[436.54s -> 453.38s]  Hey! Patapon. It's a kid's game. Every game is a kid's game, apparently. Oh, it's a rhythm game.
[456.41s -> 460.81s]  Name me a game that's not a kid's game. That you guys would, all right, I just got freaked out
[460.81s -> 464.65s]  because I was like, why doesn't it know my name? I just put it in. Earthen turned out to be
[464.65s -> 468.41s]  unreachable. The Patapon's long voyage ended as this ship sank to the bottom of the ocean. I told you.
[471.62s -> 476.10s]  Washed up on an unknown shore alone, Hatapon exhausts its last ounce of strength to hold
[476.10s -> 484.17s]  onto the sacred drum. Almighty leader, I pray to you. I'm the leader? I beg of you, please have
[484.17s -> 492.84s]  mercy on us, Patapons. Pon pon pon, strike the drum four times. Listen to the drum's rhythm. Pon
[492.84s -> 505.30s]  pon pon pon. Okay. That was cute. You got it. There are four drum beats in one measure. If you
[505.30s -> 510.26s]  keep to the beat for four counts, one measure, you'll perform a command. Give it a try. Hit
[510.26s -> 521.99s]  pon four times in a row to save the princess. This is like a turn-based RPG. Listen to that drum. I
[521.99s -> 530.58s]  feel it returning our power. What could it be, our mighty leader? Oh benevolent one, I always knew
[530.58s -> 533.94s]  you would come for us. That's why I protected the drum at all costs. Please take the drum.
[534.50s -> 543.53s]  I'll take it. How many drums do I get? We're going to learn about the next one.
[544.57s -> 559.98s]  Okay, that's pon, pata. Cool. What battery do I have in this controller? We'll find out. Almighty
[559.98s -> 564.22s]  leader, I pray to you. Almighty Jerry, lend your strength to the Patapon so that they may continue
[564.22s -> 581.62s]  their quest. Let's practice. Next, pata, pata, pata pon. Pata pon. Easy there, mighty leader.
[581.62s -> 588.49s]  Chillax and feel the rhythm. If you match the four beats properly. I didn't do it.
[590.81s -> 597.13s]  Please don't beat. Wait, what? Patapons will march for four beats. When they stop,
[597.13s -> 615.83s]  you got to start drumming. Oh, I haven't done it. Okay. It's four beats in one measure. Okay.
[617.83s -> 639.18s]  Okay. I'm going to fuck this all up, aren't I? They're going to get so hard. You're ready.
[640.14s -> 659.35s]  I feel like I have Pringles can. Anybody want to invite me to their band? I'm pretty good at the
[659.35s -> 703.38s]  Pringles. I can't read. You can read it. Too much fever. Wait, we have to fight? Do I just sit back
[703.38s -> 726.33s]  here and just make noise? Attack. I did it. Do you just have to keep the beat? That's going to end
[726.33s -> 730.81s]  up being like square, circle, triangle, triangle, triangle, triangle, square, square, square, X.
[730.81s -> 741.11s]  Now I'm going to fuck the whole thing up and have to quit the game. Third time, four minutes,
[741.11s -> 754.46s]  touching, zero, coils, none. This seems kind of cool. Patapon's march. It's easy to look at
[754.46s -> 758.06s]  the Patapon's location. He's always dead center. I thought it was the same place. He's always dead.
[758.94s -> 763.91s]  Okay. During the Pata Pata march, Hatapon will march along with the rest of the army.
[763.91s -> 767.43s]  During the Pon Pon attack, chant, he'll bravely maintain his position.
[770.76s -> 773.88s]  Uh, all right. A mysterious race that hide their face behind masks.
[774.60s -> 781.37s]  Medan came upon them when she went wandering on an unknown. She took Hatapon and the others
[781.37s -> 784.73s]  to the place she had stumbled upon. They arrived at the end of the night in the ruins of Patapon's
[784.73s -> 797.14s]  village, Patopolis. I gotta turn this up on my end. Almighty Jeremy, thank you for helping me out
[797.14s -> 809.10s]  of that disaster. You're welcome. I need to be able to hear the beat. All right. Yeah, you're
[809.10s -> 814.70s]  welcome. Great to see you again. I'm the priestess of the great Patapon. My name is Medan. Your
[814.70s -> 822.33s]  return celebration is about to start, but first please follow me. This stone obelisk is the pride
[822.33s -> 828.65s]  of the Patapon tribe. It shows that our ancestors once thrived in this area. If we want to reach
[828.65s -> 834.31s]  Earthen, do we have to retake the former Patopolis? We'll talk more later. Right now,
[834.31s -> 837.83s]  please head through the obelisk to go hunting for some meat to fill our stomachs.
[842.84s -> 859.06s]  What? I can like move around. Look, I should save. Okay, cool. Let's go hunting on Torchira
[859.06s -> 863.62s]  beach. Those Patophons are always hungry. Hunt some game so they can prepare some meat.
[864.34s -> 876.68s]  All right, let's do it. Headquarters. These are the troops. HP 120 crit ratio 15%.
[877.64s -> 887.34s]  Damage 4 to 12. Attack speed 2. Resist. Ignite. All right. Equip. Wooden helm. Wooden sphere.
[888.22s -> 901.54s]  Do they have it on? Wooden helm. Standard issue helmet. Okay, a normal Patapon. You can select
[901.94s -> 910.60s]  who. All right, should I give somebody hair? What's the hair do? Hairpiece worn by the lord
[910.60s -> 920.70s]  of a certain island country grants the user a body of steel. All right, let's do it. I love this.
[920.70s -> 932.54s]  There's an optimize button. Look at that stat difference. Is there a bad stat difference?
[932.54s -> 940.90s]  Wait, how do I equip? Lordly hairpiece. There's no stat difference. I see like a bunch of
[941.70s -> 946.74s]  ups or something. What's on the bottom? Just hit optimize. Optimize the squad.
[947.99s -> 952.82s]  Takes it off. That's resistant. I want you to wear this. Somebody can wear it. Whatever.
[953.62s -> 967.58s]  All right, let's go. Let's rest up. We've got a big day. Lordly hairpiece gives immunity to
[967.58s -> 974.44s]  all statuses. That's cool. All right, are we ready? The Patophons have the courage to fight.
[974.44s -> 1004.31s]  It's amazing. That's the way. Guide the Yerepons to find their prey. What was it? What was it?
[1004.31s -> 1011.69s]  What was it? Wait, hold on. Tell me the forward march. I just got struck by lightning.
[1012.17s -> 1035.43s]  Okay. No, shit. What's attack? Okay, attack. What's attack? I don't remember. What was it?
[1035.43s -> 1074.20s]  What is it? What's attack? What's attack? Attack. Forward. No, not backwards. All right, attack.
[1074.20s -> 1104.97s]  Again, it hit its dead body. There's too much going on. What do we need? Shit.
[1105.69s -> 1136.74s]  We're good. I pick up two. What? Ruined. Go, go, go, go, go. Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[1138.02s -> 1156.12s]  I got three teeth. Earth end to earth end. I'm going to be really bad at this game. I just want to
[1156.12s -> 1159.00s]  make that really clear to everybody. There's going to be like five combinations eventually,
[1159.00s -> 1163.24s]  and it's going to be too much for me. It's going to get locked up and confused in my brain,
[1163.24s -> 1169.83s]  and I'm going to rage put the game in above 45. I'm glad we're seeing the credits right now.
[1170.79s -> 1182.68s]  There are only four combo. I'm just kidding.
[1183.56s -> 1195.02s]  Oh, great, Jerry. Thank you for this food that you've blessed us with. Yum. Look how our people
[1195.02s -> 1200.94s]  have come home. We're all excited over the great Jerry's return. Hooray for Jerry. Hooray for the
[1200.94s -> 1207.42s]  great Patapon. Everyone, give you thanks to Jerry. This grace has made all these blessings possible.
[1209.27s -> 1212.63s]  Great Jerry, please allow me to show the way to our altar.
[1212.63s -> 1223.66s]  Phrase. Phrase. All the collected bounty is placed on this altar as a humble offering to you,
[1223.66s -> 1230.82s]  oh great Jerry. I have to see what kind of offerings have been made. Upgrades? Are they
[1230.82s -> 1238.68s]  going to do upgrades? This is from me. Pon Pon. The bravery drum obtained by agreeing to become
[1238.68s -> 1249.24s]  the Patapon God. It's oh. The strokes drum. Okay. The song. Pat-a-pat-a-pat-a-pon. Attack.
[1249.24s -> 1256.66s]  Pon Pon Patapon, right? Legendary memory. This great warrior once fought a thousand foes.
[1256.66s -> 1266.23s]  Meat. Cafeteria meat. Okay. And then wait, there's a crafting system? A magnificent
[1266.23s -> 1284.86s]  warped fang. Shaved down to use as a weapon. Huh. Oh, all right. Do I eat this? Oh. Use it later for
[1284.86s -> 1294.82s]  materials. Oh, okay. It's used for upgrades. Oh, all right. That's cool. Can I do anything else?
[1294.82s -> 1299.54s]  Our wish is to look upon it at earth end. A's upon it for eternal bliss.
[1300.58s -> 1311.91s]  How come only two people have a piece of meat? All right. Let's go. What's next?
[1312.71s -> 1321.61s]  What did they find blocking their way? It's demons. No, it's the Karmic.
[1322.73s -> 1337.14s]  All right. So wait, can I use the like anything new? Can't use the fangs. Let's just go.
[1337.86s -> 1353.61s]  Let's rest up. We got a big day tomorrow. Okay. Here we go. One, two, three, and then
[1353.61s -> 1383.94s]  will we start? Here we go. Wait, we just start. Now. Attack. Get it. Take it down.
[1385.62s -> 1424.68s]  Time it. Kill it. Get up there. Wait, it won't crumble. Well, why? Do we have to go home
[1424.68s -> 1458.70s]  because we're not strong enough? Oh, okay. Can I pause this? You guys are getting a
[1458.70s -> 1464.10s]  delay because people think I'm missing the beat. I think there's a delay because I'm doing it
[1464.10s -> 1478.10s]  right. Um, how do I, I gotta, I gotta change this. There's a delay on here. See if this fixes it.
[1478.74s -> 1520.81s]  For a rhythm game, you guys shouldn't have a delay. Is it better? Better? Okay. Don't kill him.
[1521.69s -> 1532.09s]  My kind of known as Tetipon. We will join you. Okay. Victory. Let's go. Do I have a new beat now?
[1541.10s -> 1593.40s]  Attack. Holy shit. Oh God. Oh God. Go forward. Go, go, go. Can I lose the fever? Get in there.
[1596.78s -> 1608.60s]  Kill him. All right. Forward, forward, forward, forward. Oh shit. Get this tower.
[1617.18s -> 1644.20s]  Get him. All right. Forward. Kill. Shit. I thought I was going to be alive.
[1644.92s -> 1661.05s]  Is that a spell? I don't think you have any trouble. What? Wait, come with us. What?
[1661.77s -> 1676.44s]  Can we stop singing? Dude, I'm telling you, reading this shit. Okay. Reading and like pressing these
[1676.44s -> 1688.12s]  buttons is impossible for me. See you later. Mighty Jarrah. Okay. Just go get it. It's a,
[1688.12s -> 1715.77s]  it's scratching your head and rumbly belly at the same time. Kill it. You're good. It's literally
[1715.77s -> 1732.41s]  two buttons. All right. Well, I just looked at chat to read what you said. Uh, just rub head
[1732.41s -> 1764.98s]  and circle belly. If you land perfect beats, you can get fever twice as fast. Okay. All right.
[1764.98s -> 1768.02s]  You'll be constantly acquiring new weapons and helmets. Don't forget to equip them. They'll
[1768.02s -> 1772.79s]  raise stats like HP and attack power and can become the key to victory. Always use triangle
[1772.79s -> 1782.86s]  and optimize your Patapon's shoes. Sure. A great warrior, Pan Patapon is a legendary hero.
[1782.86s -> 1788.30s]  He'll be the one that restores a master sprout to full glory. Great, Jerry. If you could please
[1788.30s -> 1797.58s]  follow me, I must show you something. We need Mater Sprout to return Mater to the Tree of Life
[1797.58s -> 1803.74s]  back to life. This must be done. There are rumors of Dodongo is here. The Dodongo ruins
[1803.74s -> 1809.90s]  just past Nanjaro Hill. Defeat Dodongo and return the Mater Sprout. These are all made up words.
[1809.90s -> 1814.54s]  Okay. Oh yeah. I can't believe you can't pronounce a Mater. These are all made up fucking words.
[1815.50s -> 1837.14s]  It's the guy. What's the guy from Cards? What are you talking about? Cards2fan can't pronounce
[1837.14s -> 1843.64s]  Mater. Wait, somebody said, so there's one person that was nice to me. What does it say? Don't feel
[1843.64s -> 1851.32s]  bad about missing the pattern up. You'll get used to it. Wow. A C and a C of, of just, of thank you.
[1852.20s -> 1862.44s]  Wow. I mean, I'm so happy to hear that. Holy shit. I thank you. You, I thank you. Wow. I feel great.
[1863.64s -> 1868.30s]  All right. What do we get? Common stone full of impurities, but vital nevertheless.
[1868.94s -> 1880.65s]  Oh, there's a shield. What is this? Key item. And that guy is feeding his ego.
[1881.53s -> 1894.09s]  All right. I want to make some items. All right. In search of the Mater Sprout and the rumor
[1894.09s -> 1899.37s]  Dodongo that is said to be roaming around these parts. Unbeknownst to all, a destined meeting is
[1899.37s -> 1911.67s]  about to take place. Here we go. Let's equip and should we just do optimize? Oh, iron spear. You
[1911.67s -> 1922.79s]  have an iron spear. Damage six to 16. All right. Well, yeah, that's good. And switch. I want you in
[1922.79s -> 1941.51s]  the front then. Oh, somebody in the back. I don't have, I don't have a bow. All right. Well, I'm,
[1941.51s -> 1950.14s]  I mean, he has an iron now, but I got one. How do I, how do I put it on? Can't make new units yet.
[1951.32s -> 1956.36s]  Oh, well, whatever. All right. Let's, let's go. Groups ready. All right. I'm going to get it.
[1956.36s -> 1959.96s]  That one person. I don't worry about messing up the patterns. You're like going to get rid of,
[1959.96s -> 1991.43s]  you'll get it. See? Oh, let's go. That person was just, did it. There we go. Oh, you're missing.
[1992.55s -> 2029.18s]  Get it. What are they doing? What's wrong? Attack it. Why are you jumping? Why are they jumping
[2029.18s -> 2043.48s]  higher? What happened? It's a drum solo. Get over it, Patipont. I'm fucking God. I could do what I
[2043.48s -> 2067.54s]  want. Oh, we got a triangle now. Oh, mighty leader. Can you hear me? Time for you to learn a third
[2067.54s -> 2073.06s]  song. The chaka chaka song. This is the lament of defense. Used to get out of tough spots.
[2074.10s -> 2099.19s]  How is it? What does it do? How do I do it? How do I do it? Oh, fuck. What does it do? Defense?
[2100.39s -> 2141.61s]  Move. I forget it. I forget it. I don't know what it is. Kill. This? Attack it?
[2143.05s -> 2169.58s]  Split it. All right. Now defense. Go forward. What? Oh, hit him. Did I block it?
[2173.45s -> 2191.14s]  What is this? No, back up, back up, back up. All right. Attack. Kill him. Wait, defense.
[2191.14s -> 2213.72s]  What? Why did they put the hat on that guy? Kill it. No, no, no, no, no. Don't go forward.
[2216.60s -> 2258.76s]  I forget the controls. Defense. I fucked it up. Okay. Bro. Oh, I did it. Sounds like the minions.
[2270.98s -> 2278.28s]  Somebody just lost a shitload of money. Heading on the fact that I wasn't going to figure out
[2278.28s -> 2283.80s]  how to do that. I gave a certain. I gave a C with certain. You put like 500 fucking thousand
[2283.80s -> 2288.04s]  dollars on that. It's like, what a certain play that is. And you just lost a ton of money.
[2288.76s -> 2299.16s]  And in a way, I feel bad for you. Here, you bet against me though. All right. If you perfectly
[2299.16s -> 2305.53s]  time all four beats, you'll hear Crystal's ding. Okay, cool. Rack up enough perfect beats and
[2305.53s -> 2311.37s]  combo points during fever mode to set off the hero mode. He'll perform unnatural acts of bravery
[2311.37s -> 2320.68s]  and might depending on his class. All right, that's cool. Jeremy, we finally found the chosen
[2320.68s -> 2333.21s]  one. Chosen one, huh? Don't make me laugh. I heard it's an old legend. Funny looking mask dude
[2333.21s -> 2340.82s]  will save the world after meeting Jera the great pattern. Funny looking. Great Jera, what should
[2340.82s -> 2346.10s]  we call this strange masked fellow? Call me? You're going to name me? Oh, you must be insane. In the
[2346.10s -> 2365.69s]  membrane.
[2367.53s -> 2379.86s]  Hera is a very nice name. I love it. Hera. I guess Hera it is. I like I have a choice.
[2381.21s -> 2385.45s]  It's Jera, right? Here's the deal. I must obey the one that names me, which means you.
[2386.65s -> 2397.94s]  Oh, great Jera and brave Hera, please come this way. This is the Parajet Prime. Only Jera and
[2397.94s -> 2402.42s]  Hera can enter. You have a mysterious egg. You can interact with heroes from other worlds.
[2403.38s -> 2412.22s]  You can't run a mysterious egg, so don't worry as they pat upon. Do you really care about naming
[2412.22s -> 2426.55s]  them? Let's check it out. I was going to just press enter. I was going to just press enter
[2426.55s -> 2438.71s]  when you're on hero. All right, let's go in here. Please don't forget the Mater Sprout. We needed to
[2438.71s -> 2446.82s]  succeed, but you are the chosen one. You can teleport to another world. Okay, that's cool.
[2447.62s -> 2466.31s]  Should we do that here? Wait, who are these people? Formation. Dodongo Egg One.
[2467.35s -> 2472.95s]  Mysterious egg that leads you to battle with Dodongo grants Demerian's power. He Lord of
[2472.95s -> 2483.34s]  Halon and Fire Tardens. Okay, what do I do with it? Iron Spear. Ooh, what's this thing? Friendship
[2483.34s -> 2500.65s]  Spear. Raises HP. Friendship Helm. Wow, and a Shuba. Okay, what's this normal? All right,
[2500.65s -> 2513.62s]  Friendship Spear and Friendship Helm. I can't touch these people, right? Boy,
[2513.62s -> 2521.78s]  are you sure you want to engage? Yeah. Wait, what is going on? Going to another world with four heroes?
[2523.66s -> 2553.98s]  Wait, what? Wait, what? Oh, shit, hold on. All right, now block. He's gonna do it. He's gonna do it.
[2557.90s -> 2589.86s]  Kill. Forward. No, go again. Defend. Forward. Forward. Here we go.
[2591.78s -> 2626.04s]  Attack. Attack again. Attack again. Get it. Oh, wait, what? The boss fight?
[2627.24s -> 2650.02s]  All right, now. No, don't do that. Now attack. Spears. Throw. Forward.
[2650.98s -> 2676.22s]  Karla? Karla. Subs? Holy shit. Come on. A lot of subs came in. That's a lot. That's a lot of subs. A
[2676.22s -> 2688.78s]  hundred subs. From Zyxia. Thanks for the fucking hundred community subs. That's so many. Wait,
[2688.78s -> 2703.03s]  we're not getting out. Kill them. A hundred community subs. Holy shit. Thank you for that.
[2703.03s -> 2710.44s]  I think there's gonna be an insane amount of subs. Look at those coins. Where'd you get those coins?
[2711.32s -> 2738.39s]  Oh, shit. Kevon's dead. We got him. I revived him. Attack. Shit. Too much. Too much.
[2740.31s -> 2757.93s]  All right, now go forward. He's running. Shit, he's not running. Oops, I forgot. Oh, fuck. Wait,
[2757.93s -> 2785.69s]  wait, wait, wait, wait. Kill him. He's looking kind of fucking grim. Okay, he's running away.
[2785.69s -> 2808.60s]  Pick it up. What does this do with this? Is this like a slot? Timing's way off. It's not.
[2809.72s -> 2813.16s]  I mean, it was right there. Look, there's a delay. There's a desync that I can't.
[2816.09s -> 2846.14s]  Just hold on a second. Oh, there's a time limit on this. This guy's not strong enough.
[2846.70s -> 2850.55s]  Are they strong enough for this?
[2868.65s -> 2897.18s]  Kill. Kill him. Oh, fuck. That guy got like yeeted the fuck out of here. Is he gone? He's dead.
[2897.90s -> 2937.48s]  All right, run. Get to the end quick. Yes. The drum in time with the rhythm. What? Oh, what?
[2938.28s -> 2949.43s]  This is like wrong. Now everyone come together. It's time for the big finish.
[2966.31s -> 2998.28s]  I did it. One last time. I got him. Oh, it's copyright. No, no, this is not fucking copyright.
[2998.28s -> 3010.62s]  God damn it. I'll see you guys later. Fuck. I'm out. How was I supposed to know this fucking
[3010.62s -> 3014.78s]  whole game was copyrighted? What the fuck? That's how they do it to me. Oh, there's a treasure
[3014.78s -> 3030.42s]  chest. Wait, how much does it cost? 60? Shit. I got adamantium. Okay, hold on. Do you want to
[3030.42s -> 3039.66s]  change Parachari into Kaching and return to Patopolis? Like I just opened up like my
[3039.66s -> 3043.42s]  teenager's phone and looking at text messages and I don't know what these things mean.
[3044.38s -> 3054.02s]  What is he saying when he's talking to his friend? Do I want to change Parachari into Kaching?
[3054.90s -> 3063.94s]  Yes, I think. Quite 130 Kaching. I don't know what that does. What is it? All right.
[3064.66s -> 3078.44s]  There's a delay on the fucking stupid ass thing. Try to fix it. It's ruined. The Pata Gate is a
[3078.44s -> 3083.32s]  portal that connects fragments from other Patapon worlds. There's a distinct beat that permeates
[3083.40s -> 3091.40s]  throughout this realm. Listen closely to its rhythm. Don Shin Kenhai. Success will only be
[3091.40s -> 3097.38s]  achieved if all hero Patapons follow this special rhythm. I thought I turned off my Discord
[3097.38s -> 3109.06s]  notifications. Don't call me. A hundred community subs from Zyxia. I want to make sure I address
[3109.06s -> 3114.90s]  it because that's a fucking ton of money. That's $500 that they just dropped. Be able to buy those.
[3115.86s -> 3118.76s]  Thanks. That's fucking insane. Thank you.
[3128.78s -> 3131.53s]  We cut the dinosaur's head off?
[3133.85s -> 3152.49s]  That's a hundred Little Caesar's pizzas. I mean, yeah, I guess it is. All right. So that was like
[3152.49s -> 3158.49s]  a little encounter. Oh, this is this game's pretty cute. This is a cool game. All right.
[3158.49s -> 3167.26s]  We got all this other stuff. Life Seed is hidden somewhere in the Ancient Ruins. Defeat the Dodonga
[3167.26s -> 3176.79s]  at the Dodonga. Defeat the Dodonga at the Dongara Ruins. Oh, this is the sprout. Okay. Here we go.
[3177.35s -> 3184.98s]  Let's do some equipment. Let's do some optimization. Iron Spear is wooden helm. Iron
[3184.98s -> 3192.12s]  helm. Oh, I got an iron helm. It's a lordly hair piece. No, I don't have any more iron helms.
[3193.24s -> 3204.17s]  Yeah. Put on that funny hair. But you. Friendship Spear. Yeah. Friendship helm. That's all I got.
[3205.05s -> 3214.81s]  The funny hair. Oh, no, no, no. All right. I think I'm ready. A bunch of iron helms.
[3217.03s -> 3228.65s]  They're all not wearing them. Oh, oh, oh, oh. You can change the Masked Dude's class.
[3230.81s -> 3250.49s]  Hero Mask of Phantom Strike. I don't think I can do a. Oh, just go. Let's rest up. We got a big day.
[3260.52s -> 3302.54s]  Oh, it can't be offbeat. I wouldn't have a fever right now. I just defended. Are we all right? Oh,
[3302.54s -> 3361.96s]  shit. Blocked it. Broke. Blocked. Good. What? We're dead. Wait, what? Does defend not happen
[3361.96s -> 3372.49s]  until after they sing it? Because I defended it and then he hit me. But it wasn't ready. Do
[3372.49s -> 3379.26s]  they have to sing it first? I was like when I when I do defend don't don't don't don't
[3379.26s -> 3386.81s]  they have to does it take one was too low? Why they all leave? Nobody think I'm cool anymore.
[3388.98s -> 3400.17s]  Oh, this guy's not we're just guy didn't die. I didn't like that. We're gone. New God. They
[3400.17s -> 3416.54s]  defend right when the beat finishes. OK, try again. How long does it defend last?
[3417.26s -> 3424.10s]  One of those things that's like, oh, it's like two seconds or three seconds. There's the next bar.
[3424.90s -> 3451.67s]  Unturned. OK. Now we go. Did it.
[3457.85s -> 3465.38s]  We just got struck by fucking lightning. How do you get back? Is it like a go back command?
[3467.29s -> 3481.43s]  What's like the go back command? What is it? I don't have that yet. Oh, wait, what?
[3482.31s -> 3510.62s]  Oh, wait, am I supposed to be here? I think I did it. What's with the lightning?
[3512.46s -> 3518.94s]  Oh, sorry. I defend. We're going to start for fucking lightning again.
[3524.68s -> 3537.16s]  Don't don't come on. Get the fuck out of here. Back up, June.
[3538.36s -> 3572.92s]  Back up. I need the guy. I need that fucking funny hat on. What the fuck? This is the armor.
[3572.92s -> 3578.42s]  I have iron armor on. Is that the problem? Well, we're dead again.
[3579.86s -> 3586.36s]  But the lightning is just destroying me. All right. Well, I got to get like lightning
[3586.36s -> 3594.50s]  resistant. I have to go back and grind. Wait, I can do that. I have to play other. Wait, hold on.
[3594.50s -> 3604.54s]  What? Oh, it's not just play the game. I have to go back and like and like grind for items.
[3605.18s -> 3619.19s]  I got to grind. Hold on. Let me go look at my stuff. You're offbeat. I'm.
[3620.23s -> 3632.12s]  I can't get fevers consistent. You're not. And I have a shitty Elgato. You are offbeat.
[3632.12s -> 3639.56s]  How do I get fevers then? That doesn't make sense. All right. So why does fever appear on screen?
[3640.12s -> 3651.75s]  What are we talking about? Pity fevers. Can we go over this right now?
[3653.48s -> 3656.20s]  Is there a delay when I'm selecting these? You guys have seen a delay. You have to be.
[3666.17s -> 3685.38s]  We're not. What? The drums sound different. What? Just just emulated. I'm going to try this. No,
[3686.18s -> 3692.63s]  let's see what they have for equipment. What about with my resistance? This guy has a hat on.
[3693.35s -> 3706.57s]  Iron helm. Wait, was that person lying to me or does this actually conduct electricity with
[3706.57s -> 3712.22s]  lightning? We need gas lighting and we almost got him. Oh, you do. It happened like 20 minutes ago.
[3725.34s -> 3732.79s]  He almost got him. Let me try this again. I can't have any other gear. If I don't do
[3732.79s -> 3792.17s]  this now, I'm going to go back and get better stuff. Here we go. Here we go. Fuck. Fuck. Attack.
[3792.17s -> 3882.07s]  Call it. Where is he? But you guys talk about perfect. Perfect every time. What?
[3924.30s -> 3928.62s]  You got to get perfect. If you don't hear the cymbal, then don't play the video game.
[3928.62s -> 3936.52s]  I forgot. Didn't break combo all the entire game, but didn't get it perfect every time. Why even
[3937.00s -> 3946.71s]  why even load the video game in the first place? I mean, what the hell? Load up a fucking robot to
[3946.71s -> 3969.14s]  make every press perfect. You fucking stupid. I did it. Am I on easy? No. Keep to the rhythm
[3969.14s -> 3974.89s]  for a few counts and score multiple combo points. Soon you'll be in fever mode. When the Patapons
[3974.89s -> 3979.13s]  are in fever mode, their attack and defense skills increase dramatically. Cool. Yeah. What's the next
[3979.13s -> 3984.33s]  paragraph say? Oh, if you don't get perfect every time uninstall this game. Oh, is that what it's
[3984.33s -> 3988.41s]  trying? I can't see. Can I zoom in? Does it say that anywhere? Where does it say that? I'm just
[3988.41s -> 4003.88s]  trying to find where that says that. It's you have to scroll. Oh shit. I'm sorry. I didn't scroll.
[4005.00s -> 4023.62s]  Roll down. You guys are fucked. All right, let's go. Awakening from the sleep that has
[4023.62s -> 4043.21s]  overtaken your roots. Oh, we had huge money. Hold on. Throw away 985. Thanks for 50 dollars.
[4043.93s -> 4056.65s]  Thanks for the huge money. Throw away 985. Thank you so much. They say, hey,
[4056.65s -> 4062.01s]  Jerma have bits. I'm not letting the government have this money. Chat are paid actors. Top
[4062.01s -> 4066.81s]  Donators are your gambling addiction fencing money. I know the truth. Stay safe and marry the McChicken
[4066.81s -> 4075.59s]  Queen already. Are you guys like paid actors? Is somebody you guys just get getting paid from
[4075.59s -> 4080.63s]  somebody to come and like tell me that I can't get perfect every time. Somebody's gonna be paying you.
[4081.43s -> 4093.00s]  It seems like too much work. Are they right? Wait, you guys aren't getting paid.
[4095.70s -> 4108.10s]  Wait, are you getting paid? Who's getting paid? I'm not a livered shea.
[4111.48s -> 4117.56s]  Oh, let's see. Legendary memory. 286 Ka-ching. This is where I get another person. Wait,
[4118.28s -> 4125.86s]  confirm. So these are my slots. Hey, Kazzy. Thanks for the five subs, Kazzy. Five community subs.
[4126.42s -> 4140.63s]  Just dropped him right now. Thank you. So should I get a tate pond? Normal. Pollution map.
[4144.15s -> 4159.38s]  Pateria meat. Okay, I can only do this. Create normal, a normal pat-a-pon. It's one meat,
[4159.38s -> 4178.86s]  one stone, and 12 dollars. Pio Pio. Pio Pio. Hard iron. Okay, tender meat. These extra large
[4178.86s -> 4186.44s]  size pat-a-pons are great against knockback. Resistance gets cold but weak against fire.
[4187.64s -> 4194.82s]  Should I get another one? Should I just get two? Or should I get another yary pond?
[4195.62s -> 4210.92s]  Should I just fill it up? Whoa. Is that your TV to game mode? I'm not on a TV.
[4218.34s -> 4223.94s]  It's always so funny going to somebody's house that had that shit where there was like a full
[4223.94s -> 4229.80s]  half second input delay and they didn't even know it existed. And you sit there and you grab
[4229.80s -> 4237.30s]  the controller or you try to do something, you're like, holy shit. And then you change it and they're
[4237.30s -> 4244.09s]  like, what did you do? This doesn't feel right anymore. What the fuck? It's like, dude, you have...
[4244.09s -> 4260.55s]  Okay, let's get another one. Here we go. We're going to plant another person. Here they come.
[4261.27s -> 4272.50s]  Okay, let's do another one. I got money, right? Wait, what's this? Oh, it's it.
[4274.58s -> 4280.54s]  So I have three yary ponds and three pat-a-pons. Should I just fill it up?
[4290.12s -> 4297.91s]  No stones. Oh, I don't have any more stones. Shit. Yeah, well, I have three guys now.
[4307.26s -> 4310.22s]  Master will surely be of use to you. Mater, whatever it is.
[4311.02s -> 4317.27s]  I got like, can I... Look at all this stuff. New shields. All right, I got some new stuff.
[4317.27s -> 4325.34s]  I got to look. All right, well, here we are. Carmen fortress. Did you use the tree of life
[4325.34s -> 4329.74s]  to befriend some tatypons? Time has come to rally the pat-a-pons and head out for earthen.
[4330.70s -> 4348.46s]  All right, so where's my... Where's my tatypons? Oh, right. There they are. What do they got?
[4349.80s -> 4360.50s]  Optimize. Whoa. Friendship sword, wooden helm, and friendship shield. Steel shield.
[4362.90s -> 4372.73s]  Pin axe. What's a friendship sword do? Oh, raise HP. Is HP at now 300 versus 200? That's pretty good.
[4373.69s -> 4389.67s]  Okay. What about you guys? Optimize. It always takes the hat off. What about you? Optimize. Glass.
[4390.79s -> 4399.18s]  Evolve to yary pond. Evolve to tatypon. Special move. Energy... Hold on. The iron fist causes
[4399.18s -> 4405.19s]  damage over a wide area. Effective against enemy structures and any enemy nearby. Energy field.
[4405.19s -> 4409.11s]  Surround all pat-a-pons in an impermeable protective shield. A major drawback is that
[4409.11s -> 4417.75s]  the shield will limit the troops' attack abilities. Dammit. Iron fist. Let's do this one. Does it work?
[4419.32s -> 4442.39s]  Evolve to yary pond. He already is a yary pond. Oh. All right. Let's move out. Shuba duba doo.
[4442.39s -> 4471.00s]  Here we go. The pat-a-pons are here. One, two, three, four. How do you do his move?
[4471.96s -> 4567.35s]  Oops. Get off. All right. Now attack. I forgot it. The coins. Bow. Bow and arrow guy. Go forward.
[4567.99s -> 4703.46s]  Here we go. You're not a gamer. Forward. Forward. And... I think Carmen? Forward. I don't understand.
[4704.74s -> 4720.01s]  Oh, this is not correct. None of your commands are on beat. That doesn't make any sense.
[4720.97s -> 4783.26s]  Somebody said it's getting old, chat. Well, just leave him. Oh. Two consecutive beats takes it. Oh,
[4783.26s -> 4797.16s]  okay. All right. Sorry, sweetie. The PS4 remaster has a slight audio delay. That's why it's not
[4797.16s -> 4802.04s]  on beat. You notice that sometimes the pat-a-pons sound different. That means it's on beat.
[4803.08s -> 4821.86s]  Wait, the PS4 remaster has an audio delay? Am I being lied to? It's real. It's true? As a germ...
[4821.86s -> 4839.75s]  I'm seeing a lot of one guy say it's real. Oh, who cares? It is real. Google it. What? What?
[4839.75s -> 4847.53s]  Pat-a-pon 2 remaster audio delay? Why did I put... I put an ex... I put like a... I asked a question.
[4848.25s -> 4859.69s]  Ironically, the first pat-a-pon remaster also had this delay issue and it hasn't been fixed
[4859.69s -> 4864.07s]  despite pat-a-pon 2 remaster launching nearly three years later. You'll need to play with
[4864.07s -> 4868.95s]  headphones to eliminate the sound lag that's introduced between the controller and the TV.
[4868.95s -> 4889.83s]  What? This shit is real. Wait, what? Oh, no. This is bad. It's pulling through a capture card,
[4889.83s -> 4897.35s]  so it's always going to be bad. It's always going to be fucked up. I don't think I'm ever going to
[4897.35s -> 4908.30s]  get it right. It didn't fix the input delay for pat-a-pon 2. Hold on. It was unplayable in the
[4908.30s -> 4911.90s]  first pat-a-pon on PS4. And to be honest, it's a little better on this one. We still have to
[4911.90s -> 4916.22s]  really be sharp when playing the songs. I was expecting some kind of calibration system like
[4916.22s -> 4921.50s]  in Guitar Hero. The real problem is the controller has a big input delay because of the wireless that
[4921.50s -> 4924.86s]  happens to almost any Bluetooth device. Try watching a movie on a Bluetooth speaker.
[4927.90s -> 4936.50s]  Wait, what? I tried playing with a metronome at 120 beats per minute, which is the beat of pat-a-pon.
[4944.20s -> 4957.29s]  Metronome. 120 beats per minute? Is this going to work? Let me see if I can... I
[4957.29s -> 4963.93s]  can't hear both of them at the same time though. Why are you playing on the capture card? Do you
[4963.93s -> 4975.96s]  have any idea how streaming works? Do I have to actually answer this? Wait, how do you think you're
[4975.96s -> 5009.34s]  seeing the video game? I'm using telepathy to give you this on the screen? I'm delayed by 650
[5009.34s -> 5013.83s]  milliseconds because I'm going through the capture card. Yeah, this is not going to work because I
[5013.83s -> 5019.90s]  have to delay this by 650 milliseconds for you to even hear it. All right, so just do it earlier
[5019.90s -> 5029.88s]  is what the goal is. This proves I apparently have to hit it like a quarter of a second earlier than I
[5029.88s -> 5050.18s]  am. Later? Let me try that theory. Do it earlier. Let's just try this out. Let's just go to like
[5050.18s -> 5056.42s]  fucking level one. See, I'm just going to level one. Let me get this right. Okay, let's deploy.
[5057.38s -> 5081.77s]  Set it to easy? Hold on. Let's just see. Just do easy mode. So earlier. Later?
[5102.84s -> 5133.51s]  So it's slower? Okay, hold on. No. Okay, here's how I'm doing it. No, it's not working. Nevermind.
[5134.15s -> 5167.56s]  It's slower. What the hell are you saying? It makes no sense. It would be delayed for us a .u.
[5167.72s -> 5173.16s]  Uh, will you hear what we just talked about? Oh, this is like a game issue.
[5181.27s -> 5209.42s]  You, we all welcome. Hi. Let me, I wish I could hear this. It's playable. It's just you stressing
[5209.42s -> 5220.70s]  over nothing. Yeah, I kind of don't give a shit. I'm just gonna play the game. I'm just gonna play
[5220.70s -> 5230.07s]  like whatever. Who cares? I'm not gonna, it's not gonna be perfect. It's not gonna be perfect.
[5230.79s -> 5243.22s]  Game was remastered like shit. What do you want me to say? Okay, wait, wait, wait. I can make other
[5243.22s -> 5287.56s]  characters. There, yes. How much do they cost? Okay, I can make another one. Here they come.
[5287.56s -> 5321.78s]  Here it comes. Do you not split? I'm not. I play on a monitor. I capture it through OBS and I'm
[5321.78s -> 5345.03s]  playing the game captured on my monitor. I'm not playing on the OBS window. Turn the volume up and
[5345.03s -> 5359.05s]  then down. I'm going to play the game. What are you talking about? Oh, shit. That's cool.
[5379.22s -> 5380.50s]  One, two, three.
[5388.97s -> 5390.25s]  What? Where is he?
[5414.68s -> 5488.09s]  Is that like a boss? I got this little tower. Get that gore. All right, go for it. All right, now go in.
[5488.09s -> 5544.54s]  Okay. Walk. The fire is killing us. Walk. I'm a gamer. What? Get in. Oh, shit. I'm destroyed.
[5548.46s -> 5551.70s]  Oh, shit. I'm fucking dead.
[5551.86s -> 5591.18s]  Keep going. I'm trying. They got a lot more people than I do. I don't get it, man. I got to like,
[5591.18s -> 5607.54s]  I don't know.
[5617.70s -> 5648.18s]  You guys are not even very good. I'm losing too many people. All right, now go forward.
[5648.18s -> 5752.71s]  This game, I'm tired of dancing. Oh, I'm trying to do it later. Oh, I got pulled the line.
[5754.55s -> 5807.72s]  What happens when Jerma smokes DMT? What? I only got like two guys left. I'm dead. Maybe not. Oh,
[5807.72s -> 5891.16s]  he's dead. All right, go in. No, fuck. Protect that guy. Do something. Go. Do it. Yeah.
[5906.92s -> 5950.52s]  Many casualties. Hey, I still won. The Zigotan hero, Gong the Hawkeye, appeared as the Patapon's
[5950.60s -> 5955.75s]  rival in the first game. Spoilers. Thanks a lot. He fought for the Zigotan queen,
[5955.75s -> 5964.31s]  Karma, to stop the Patapon's invasion of his land. He went two to two against the Patapons,
[5964.31s -> 5979.70s]  but they fucking killed him. What if it burns one's eyes? Our scouts have looked at a giant
[5979.70s -> 5986.44s]  monchichi on the Sutton Plains. Gong might be a problem, but Medan will be way whatever.
[5987.40s -> 6010.58s]  I want to make a new guy. I need a bone. Shit. Plumps of grass. Okay. This guy drops bones.
[6012.65s -> 6025.02s]  Wait, should I go in here? Can I make other units? How many people can you have in one squad?
[6025.82s -> 6041.82s]  Oh, I can make these. Wait, hold on. I can make a Pio Pio. Should I make a Pio Pio?
[6042.46s -> 6053.21s]  This is against cold chills. There's a lot of fire units. I feel like it's probably better to make
[6053.21s -> 6082.17s]  another one. Maybe another Patapon. I'm gonna make another Patapon. Go look at the crew. Build
[6082.17s -> 6107.78s]  the squads out first. Yeah. What is this? Oh, we almost got a full squad. Steel helm, steel helm.
[6108.58s -> 6126.33s]  Still have wooden spears. What the fuck is this bullshit? Friendship bow, iron bow. Does the iron
[6126.33s -> 6134.81s]  bow do more damage? No, it does not. Am I not upgrading? I don't know. Should I save the
[6134.81s -> 6144.33s]  resources or should I just start upgrading people? Let's go like Yarra Pond. I can do this, but I
[6144.33s -> 6152.39s]  can't do this one. What about the other guys? Like what are these dudes? Yeah, I'm on a full squad
[6152.39s -> 6183.21s]  first. Can I afford another one of these here? No. So now I got six six. I wonder if this will be
[6183.21s -> 6200.55s]  good. Let's see if this works. Game lags after I open a menu. This game's just full of problems
[6200.55s -> 6214.76s]  tonight, huh? What about you? Do you still have stuff? What can you do? Friendship spear, friendship
[6214.76s -> 6225.16s]  helm. What's this? Oh, the hairpiece. No. This is so much. I have so many more units. Let's do it.
[6225.72s -> 6243.85s]  Let's go. This is going to be the only Patapon stream. You don't know that yet.
[6244.57s -> 6271.43s]  Bad guys. Oh, shit. I've killed you. Holy shit. All right. Defend. No, never mind.
[6276.04s -> 6377.82s]  Phone. Get in there. Even go in. What? Just beat him. Is this the only Patapon 2 streamer?
[6378.78s -> 6403.90s]  I don't know. I like this game. This game's fucking really, really fun. I really like it.
[6404.86s -> 6436.22s]  It's very fun. If I have to deal with a bad port, I'll deal with a bad port. It's still fun.
[6437.10s -> 6486.84s]  I still like it. It isn't a bad port. Imagine playing this on a cartridge. He won't emulate
[6487.80s -> 6494.82s]  I don't know. I don't know a DS emulator. I don't know where the fuck we can get one of those.
[6506.39s -> 6515.22s]  PSP emulator. Look, when I bought the remaster, how was I supposed to know there was like audio
[6515.22s -> 6608.10s]  input problems? How am I supposed to know that? Can I even kill this thing? It's running.
[6608.10s -> 6647.22s]  Easy. I will. I will after this. Do I have to negate some of the grinding? Is that what it does?
[6668.30s -> 6736.60s]  Jesus. Kill. Block. I got like a rare bone. Monster hunter.
[6738.36s -> 6751.75s]  Block. I thought he was going to wait a turn. He's going back. He's backing up.
[6752.47s -> 6800.06s]  All right. Block. Block. I got him. He's playing on hard. Isn't this on normal?
[6801.02s -> 6819.74s]  I got it.
[6819.74s -> 6823.66s]  Possible lose their stance and easily stagger once their HP is low.
[6823.66s -> 6827.70s]  If an item has dizzy staggered bosses have a tendency to drop items.
[6827.70s -> 6840.58s]  Is that where I got the red one from? I got a red item. All right. Let's see. I want to see what I
[6840.58s -> 6849.30s]  got. Dodeca bone. A large bone from the carcass of a large beast. These huge bones are often
[6849.30s -> 6865.03s]  used in the central pillars in homes. How do I put this on easy? Will that actually help with the
[6865.03s -> 6891.26s]  input stuff? Back to the title screen. Let's go back to the title screen. Levels like normal.
[6895.19s -> 6907.72s]  All right. Wait, speak. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's a documented issue.
[6908.84s -> 6912.52s]  You can't look at that and make fun of me. It's not fair. It's a documented issue.
[6913.16s -> 6934.12s]  Should I try the headphones thing? Headphones. Let me see if that helps.
[6943.80s -> 6962.04s]  Let's test it because maybe it was on speakers and maybe that's fucked up. I don't know.
[6962.04s -> 6994.70s]  It didn't save. Yeah, it did. Here we go. Ready? Same exact problem.
[6996.54s -> 7002.90s]  I have both headphones in. Let me try it. Let's put it on easy and see what happens.
[7007.77s -> 7021.34s]  He failed. Yeah. Sometimes you fail. What the fuck do I care?
[7037.30s -> 7044.66s]  All right. Here we go. I did get some new stuff, though. Hold on.
[7045.62s -> 7054.66s]  Friendship sword. I didn't get anything else. Wooden helm.
[7055.62s -> 7058.57s]  What do you got? Do one of you guys in the middle put the hair on?
[7062.94s -> 7068.50s]  I've got a bunch of materials. Can I not? Do I have to craft them or something?
[7076.36s -> 7098.18s]  No bullies, please. Let's see. What can I do? Level two. Two more stones and two more fangs.
[7102.84s -> 7106.44s]  Hey, Ben, thanks for the five community subs. Ben Elnor. Appreciate it. Thanks a lot.
[7107.32s -> 7115.18s]  Thank you, Ben. Upgrade the hero. How do you upgrade the hero?
[7116.38s -> 7135.35s]  Oh, we can do this now, right? Heroes inherit upgrades from anyone in the class. Oh, okay.
[7136.15s -> 7142.94s]  Questions eight. Should I go for this? Do I? I hope I don't lose out on this.
[7143.50s -> 7161.19s]  Don't waste your time with this. Change the egg. Change the egg. All right. Level two.
[7162.07s -> 7168.78s]  Mysterious egg that leads you to battle with Chichi. Grants gas hanger his power.
[7169.66s -> 7216.97s]  That's right. This is how you get better masks. All right. What's going on? Okay, I get it.
[7216.97s -> 7249.18s]  I'm like, I don't think it matters. No, it doesn't matter. This mode is always in normal.
[7251.26s -> 7298.81s]  Oh, okay. I thought he was going to attack. Yep. No.
[7322.50s -> 7325.94s]  Let's see what happens on easy if it fixes the issue.
[7326.98s -> 7355.30s]  It's emulated. Go ahead and get it on PSP. Failed. Wait, what? How? I was walking forward.
[7358.78s -> 7367.61s]  Read. I was too busy getting angry at the fact that the input works now.
[7367.61s -> 7389.93s]  How do you fail a cut scene? I'm not even looking at the screen. All right. Listen up.
[7402.07s -> 7437.16s]  Oh, it was failing for views. All right. Let's get perfect literally every fucking single time
[7437.16s -> 7441.80s]  I do this now. This window is a little bigger. This fixes the goddamn... I'm not going to get
[7441.80s -> 7552.74s]  angry about this. Let's go. Get in there. Get that thing. Kill it. Kill. Whoa. What was that?
[7555.86s -> 7567.45s]  It just gave me a new thing to do. Wait, what? Can I do it now?
[7570.86s -> 7576.89s]  I have to do it while it happens. Wait, I have to do it when that pops up.
[7581.80s -> 7608.70s]  I thought it was like teaching me a new move. Yeah, I want to get the resource.
[7609.82s -> 7641.80s]  This is way... The window is way better now. Let's do it again. You know they have X or
[7641.80s -> 7655.19s]  circle or whatever. So the idea is you grind out levels to get materials to make you guys better
[7655.19s -> 7659.11s]  to do the later level. Okay, I get it. All right. This time I got to do the beat that pops up on
[7659.11s -> 7740.49s]  that scroll. Forward. Where's that crab? Here we go. Okay. Here it comes. How do I do that?
[7742.92s -> 7760.07s]  Be closer? Square, triangle, square. It's not working. Square, triangle, square. What?
[7760.95s -> 7786.10s]  When I hit triangle, it says no. Press it. I did. Fail the rhythm. That's normal. Wait,
[7786.10s -> 7806.79s]  did I do it? I don't need to do it with the rhythm. I thought I had to do it with the rhythm.
[7810.06s -> 7828.36s]  I got too close to the totem. Cancel's combos would just do it.
[7830.84s -> 7871.91s]  I guess I'm gonna do it again. I need the materials anyway. Okay, so...
[7873.11s -> 7881.05s]  Okay, so when I see that pole to the beat, just do it. It doesn't matter. Even if it doesn't do
[7881.05s -> 7892.17s]  anything, just have to press it to the rhythm. I feel like I was trying to do that, but even if
[7892.17s -> 7907.90s]  they go, uh-oh, like, yo, that was wrong, just do it. It's not a real command. It's a pad upon.
[7907.90s -> 7923.72s]  Just push through and keep on beat. Oh, okay. I'll try it again. Do it as soon as you see the totem.
[7923.72s -> 7961.86s]  Do it four times in a row. Okay. Forward, forward, forward, forward. Where's that pole?
[7961.86s -> 7981.22s]  Forward, forward, forward. Where's that pole? I can't see what it said.
[7988.28s -> 7993.70s]  Square, triangle, what is it? Square, triangle, square, triangle.
[7998.74s -> 8026.17s]  What? I have to be closer? I thought it didn't matter. Okay. Oh, fucking god damn it.
[8045.78s -> 8118.60s]  Thanks for the key. Bye. This game's confusing my cat. What is your cat watching?
[8119.40s -> 8126.31s]  Why is he kept watching? He should be sleeping and eating like cat food.
[8127.83s -> 8161.62s]  They're too close to the screen. Tell him to back up. A ching are golden coins that shine
[8161.62s -> 8164.90s]  like newborn stars. Their glimmer of energy come from the life force they possess. Wow.
[8165.78s -> 8168.68s]  Each coin is a pad upon's life energy, so it's a soul.
[8173.03s -> 8181.48s]  Life coins. Uh, Ben coming in with five more community subs. Thanks, Ben. Another five from
[8181.56s -> 8195.11s]  Ben. Thank you fucking Ben Elnor. Thanks a lot, dude. Let's get more. More critters. More creatures.
[8198.84s -> 8218.84s]  Yeah. Wait, can I do more? He's demanding more money. More. I demand more. In the game,
[8218.84s -> 8229.27s]  of course. Okay, so now I have the thing. Let's go. Everybody's nice and locked and loaded.
[8229.91s -> 8239.70s]  How about you guys? Optimize. Yes. Okay. Go beat the shit out of this guy.
[8240.26s -> 8275.74s]  Whip it, you fool. What? Wait, that's not just like a key item? Okay. Who holds it? You?
[8282.73s -> 8304.57s]  Oh. Goes into the slot over here. Okay. $100 in bits from Vilemi. Thanks for the 10,000 bits,
[8304.57s -> 8311.37s]  Vilemi. That's fucking crazy. Thank you for the- it's a lot of money. It's a lot of money to give
[8311.37s -> 8316.50s]  somebody. Thank you. Jeremiah, I only have so much money to give you. Don't give any more.
[8317.14s -> 8323.74s]  Keep it for you. It's your money and you need it now. Don't worry about giving me money. You've
[8323.74s -> 8331.67s]  given me an insane amount of money. Don't worry about that. Thank you for the huge, huge drop.
[8332.31s -> 8359.53s]  $877 cash now. $877 cash now. You have an annuity and you need cash now. $877 cash now. $877 cash
[8359.53s -> 8379.34s]  now. It's- it helps. It's 120 beats per minute. Wait, here's the- don don do don.
[8380.70s -> 8397.43s]  Oh, great Patapon, can you hear me? Your eyeball army will melt if they continue to
[8397.43s -> 8407.93s]  trap these barren lands without some juju. They'll first turn to black puddles and then
[8407.93s -> 8411.45s]  evaporate. Use your juju powers. I'll give you a quick lesson on how to use the secrets of the
[8411.45s -> 8417.30s]  rain juju. In order to get your juju going, we first need to reach fever mode. Okay. Yes.
[8418.42s -> 8425.38s]  Once you enter in fever, hit x, x, x, x, x, don, do don, do don. When the juju dance begins,
[8425.38s -> 8430.31s]  listen carefully to the Patapon song and hit the drum to the rhythm. Okay. We need to do-
[8430.31s -> 8434.63s]  I have to be in preview.
[8489.82s -> 8493.02s]  You did it. Rain will help you cool off and it also has other secret property. Use it to
[8493.02s -> 8515.53s]  flush out Centura, a beast only visible when it rains. Okay, this is the beast.
[8536.60s -> 8551.18s]  Good job, Patathons. Play the game in mute mode.
[8553.98s -> 8559.62s]  Sorry, a fucking ghost just came out of me. I had to put it in a bottle.
[8560.34s -> 8572.89s]  I just had to spit it into a bottle. Ice shield. Wind currents will always affect your defense,
[8572.89s -> 8576.89s]  attack, and hunting strategies. It should always factor in the direction when planning your
[8576.89s -> 8582.79s]  adventures. This is- wait, this is- was it golf? All it takes is a careful eye and you'll notice
[8582.79s -> 8588.39s]  the change in wind direction. Sometimes it will blow left, stop, and then blow right. Do you
[8588.39s -> 8601.29s]  notice the pattern? Is that- oh, there's a wind? Nice golf reference.
[8604.89s -> 8608.74s]  Patathons report an invisible monster in the bouyayan basin.
[8609.93s -> 8614.41s]  Great, Jerry. Could this be the Centura creature? It's time to put the rain juju to good use.
[8615.29s -> 8634.23s]  Should I level- no. Fill it up. Where can I get fangs?
[8640.25s -> 8642.73s]  Be shaved down to use as a weapon. I guess I gotta go hunting.
[8643.45s -> 8656.70s]  One more level two. Sorry, I'm gonna go hunting for level two. I'm gonna go get fangs.
[8657.50s -> 8669.70s]  That sounds like a good idea. Centura drops fangs. Oh, okay. Wicked axe.
[8670.42s -> 8693.74s]  Okay, we need to use the gong. All right, here we go. Everybody's optimized. Ice.
[8693.74s -> 8697.96s]  Ooh, what'd you get? What's that? Ice shield. Oh, wait, wait, somebody has an ice shield.
[8697.96s -> 8702.39s]  Well, I want to see what it does. Counter- counteracts flame attacks.
[8703.27s -> 8727.03s]  Nice. Should I give friendship spear and the shuba? Let's go. Is there any reason why you're
[8727.03s -> 8733.59s]  starting at midnight EU? Because I live in the United States of America on the west coast all
[8733.59s -> 8752.74s]  the way at the end. You live in Alaska? That's not the end. That's a different- that's up in Canada.
[8753.61s -> 8772.50s]  We just like- we just like stole it one day. Okay, ready? It's time to do it.
[8776.33s -> 8817.45s]  Wind. Heed my call. All right, now is it gonna rain? All right, now we
[8818.49s -> 8853.43s]  go in there, right? Attack. All right, let's go. Block. Get in there. Defend. Yeah. Say it.
[8854.63s -> 8862.23s]  That's not a giant. That's a- that's like a slug coming up. I can't- that's hard. I have to
[8862.23s -> 8882.78s]  pay attention. Sorry, I can't. Get in there. Yes. Okay, guys, I got one core. Okay, this core
[8883.50s -> 8907.75s]  is like 12 gigahertz, but it can only do one task. You guys got like dual and quad cores.
[8909.67s -> 8918.44s]  Not me. I got one fucking core that just has a lot of computational power. And that's it.
[8932.07s -> 8939.27s]  I can't- I can't. Streamer has a pre-built brain. Don't.
[8944.10s -> 8974.63s]  Pre-built. That's fucking hilarious. Oops, I screwed it up. Okay, if you had one-
[8975.83s -> 8989.22s]  oh, the computer hung up for a second. I opened up Firefox. Okay. Oh, it's- hold on, hold on.
[8989.22s -> 9013.00s]  Come on. Get over here. Attack. And this is where we go. Defend, defend. Do it. Defend.
[9015.54s -> 9020.82s]  Defend. Do it. Defend. Attack. Attack. Attack. Attack.
[9021.86s -> 9033.00s]  Put forward. March it forward. Let me see that. Defend. Defend. Put it on. Defend.
[9034.28s -> 9043.96s]  Do it. Defend. Defend. Put it on. Defend. Attack. Force it. Attack. Force. Attack. Motherfucker.
[9044.44s -> 9066.86s]  Motherfucker. I did it wrong. One core. Fringe. Ban that person for life. Give me that. Give me
[9066.86s -> 9105.83s]  that. Get it. Okay, here comes the- defense. Put it on. Defense. Shut up. Pre-built brain.
[9109.96s -> 9129.56s]  And I'm way too expensive. I like like caviar and shit. I'm a pre-built PC.
[9139.29s -> 9142.73s]  Like you could go to the- you could go to like McDonald's and get a dinner for-
[9142.73s -> 9147.93s]  oh, I'm pre-built fucking single PCPU core brain. Yeah, there's a joke. I can't even do it.
[9147.93s -> 9170.74s]  A single fucking PCPU brain. After the boss, I'll tell it. The wind is strong. Get in closer.
[9174.10s -> 9196.07s]  Wait. He's dead. And I got an egg. I can't believe I got an egg. All right. So what was I saying?
[9196.07s -> 9200.07s]  Oh, yeah. Okay. You can get like- you can go buy like a- you could go get like a bologna
[9200.07s -> 9205.75s]  and cheese sandwich from the fucking grocery store. But I go and get a fucking bologna and
[9205.75s -> 9208.87s]  cheese sandwich from like this expensive restaurant. It's the same exact thing,
[9208.87s -> 9223.99s]  but I pay $400 for it. And by the way, I'm from outer space. I fly around in a spaceship in outer
[9223.99s -> 9233.27s]  space. That makes me some kind of a creature and an outer space being. And I like to wear clothes.
[9233.75s -> 9242.17s]  I like to put on clothes. I like to put on clothes. I like to put them on. I like to put them on.
[9243.05s -> 9279.03s]  XL size Patapods. The face cam has been on the whole time. Good. I hope you saw my fucking-
[9280.63s -> 9286.30s]  Okay. I'm going to turn it back. Maybe I should get a
[9286.94s -> 9305.46s]  Bioko. Can I get an extra large Bioko? I'm going to get one. I'm going to evolve into a Bioko.
[9305.46s -> 9315.67s]  Not for an archer. Oh yeah. One of these guys. A shield Bioko. Do I do a level two Bioko?
[9316.47s -> 9354.60s]  Dude, let's just make a level two Bioko. Nice. Holy shit. This game. Good. Whoa. Do another level one.
[9355.80s -> 9363.82s]  Do another level one Bioko. Holy shit. All right. Let's do another level one Bioko.
[9364.78s -> 9379.74s]  An archer. Cool. All right. Cool. And then I can make stuff.
[9381.62s -> 9386.28s]  Battle at Mount Gonroth. I worry your spirit is more important than orders. My ancestors
[9386.28s -> 9390.52s]  would be ashamed if I never crossed swords with you. What does that even mean? This game is
[9390.52s -> 9426.71s]  fucking terrible. What the fuck, dude? I'm just fucking kidding this guy. You think I would still
[9426.71s -> 9433.19s]  play this if I didn't think it was fun? Didn't I get another one of these guys?
[9439.19s -> 9450.81s]  Evolve to Yummy Pond. Blazing fast volley of arrows. Yeah. Wooden bow. Excuse me. We need to take a bow
[9450.81s -> 9459.29s]  from one of you guys. Give me this good one. Fire bow. Excuse me. You can take a fucking
[9459.29s -> 9474.81s]  goddamn wooden bow. Give that to the leader. Played gotcha for us. I was just kidding.
[9475.53s -> 9484.62s]  I did that because I was just making you have a reaction. Hey, you guys do it to me all the time.
[9484.62s -> 9498.70s]  I can't do it back. Here we go. Long is not our enemy. Our real opponents are those masked fools.
[9503.11s -> 9512.49s]  No, damn it, Pond. Urk. Oh, I've been waiting for you, Supreme Patapon.
[9513.69s -> 9517.35s]  You can't even beat me. You won't have a chance of beating them.
[9518.79s -> 9531.37s]  Prove your might. Give me all you got. Eye of the tiger. Okay, fine. Fine. Let's eat this shit.
[9532.98s -> 9572.23s]  Rain song. It's already raining. So now we'll get on their eyes and shit. Two rain. Double rain.
[9584.30s -> 9619.46s]  Get in there. Only offense. No defense. No. Volley. Volley. It worked. I got rid of the lightning.
[9619.46s -> 9663.32s]  Did it work? Get him. We're good. I guess I get six. That guy just got... Okay, I was gonna say.
[9663.32s -> 9683.64s]  Forward. Forward. Forward. Get in there. Now... Oops, I was... Why did I look at chat? I don't know why.
[9686.97s -> 9758.63s]  Peace out. Get in. Defend. Defend. Get in there. Defend. Again. Good. Come on. Get the guys in the back.
[9760.49s -> 9791.98s]  Attack. Kill them. Forward. Forward. Forward again. Attack. Yes.
[9791.98s -> 9803.46s]  Yes. Oh, hero sucks. It's all right. He's doing okay. What's that? A surprise attack?
[9805.88s -> 9827.51s]  Who's doing this? What? What? Who's winning? Won't cause you any more trouble.
[9828.15s -> 9830.07s]  If you wish to learn the truth, just look at the skies.
[9833.08s -> 9848.84s]  Oh, I thought you said... You can't do a timeout. What? I can't believe you guys used a timeout.
[9849.56s -> 9896.20s]  I got a lot of stuff. All right. Get in there. World ruler. That's me. Defend.
[9911.35s -> 9940.41s]  Iron helm. Get the lightning off. Oh, you mean...
[9983.08s -> 10006.31s]  Man, that person for a year. Stop. Oh, no. What's going on?
[10008.14s -> 10042.25s]  Hold on. I need a break. I need a break. Mommy, I need a break. You know, the problem is
[10043.05s -> 10050.50s]  it's really dark in my room right now. It's getting dark out. The light's not on. Hammers.
[10051.70s -> 10086.02s]  Like, look. I can't think because it's dark. Well, it's really dark.
[10096.22s -> 10122.15s]  Just look at how dark it is. It's fucking dark in here. All right. I'm going to go take a piss.
[10122.15s -> 10261.16s]  I'll be right back. I have returned. I'm ready to play more Patapon.
[10262.76s -> 10296.87s]  Yeah, I know. It's a scary image. Okay. What do you want me to tell you? It's a scary face. Yeah,
[10296.87s -> 10314.42s]  I know. I got it. Mom, they're making me look bad. Mom, they're making me look bad.
[10314.42s -> 10342.60s]  Call their parents. You have to call their parents now. All right. Let's go.
[10352.87s -> 10361.18s]  Turn of resigns. Okay. Let's keep going. I didn't even turn the fucking light on.
[10369.88s -> 10390.73s]  Shit. Have I ever eaten two pounds of yogurt in one sitting? I don't think that this is an
[10390.73s -> 10396.89s]  odd thing to admit. I didn't think so. All right. Let's go. The real threat of the Carmen. It's not
[10396.89s -> 10408.86s]  just a dirty way of doing things. It's hard to forgive. Ace opponent for eternity. I'm going to
[10408.86s -> 10420.90s]  play these guys. Should I make this? The guys with the spears, should they make them bigger?
[10420.90s -> 10436.49s]  Pick up, make up. Yo, yo, get up. Yo, yo. I need things for that. That was just,
[10436.49s -> 10438.57s]  it was incredibly satisfying. Had to watch the whole thing.
[10439.53s -> 10453.54s]  Build the, kill Centura again. Ooh, that's not a bad idea. Yeah. Let's go kill that character again.
[10461.40s -> 10476.26s]  I love that sword. Yes. All some more level two. I was going to scream. I guess
[10476.98s -> 10493.67s]  let's go. Let's just go kill Centura. What's my millionaire streamer up to today? Oh, you know,
[10493.67s -> 10508.41s]  withdrawing a thousand dollars from the bank in ones and counting it. I knew it.
[10509.61s -> 10540.33s]  Why would you ever do something like that? I don't know. Why would you? You wouldn't.
[10541.05s -> 10548.42s]  Yeah.
[10548.42s -> 10558.60s]  Germa sucks. Thanks for the five community subs. Thanks for the sub. And get in.
[10611.70s -> 10642.46s]  It is actually very fun. A blocker. It really is Monster Hunter, isn't it?
[10643.42s -> 10649.51s]  Oh, just with a bunch of little guys.
[10662.17s -> 10673.78s]  Oh, is that a golden fang? Yeah.
[10676.44s -> 10713.46s]  Hooray. Second highest tier fang. Nice. Demon fang, huh? Cool. All right. So. Oh, what?
[10714.26s -> 10739.16s]  Oh, I just shook the chills a little bit. I'm going to upgrade some of the bows.
[10741.32s -> 10759.16s]  Still need a fang for you. Because big spear guy. Oh, I can. I can level it up too. Whoa,
[10759.16s -> 10765.08s]  wait, I can make a Wanda. A rare pawn whose attack power increases gradually as he levels up. His
[10765.08s -> 10782.62s]  stagger rate is 20 percent. He's easy to put to sleep. And then do Wanda level two. I think I'm
[10782.62s -> 10795.66s]  going to do it. Wanda level two. What's down here? Whoa. Chig Yobi. This rare pawn's attack abilities
[10795.66s -> 10801.42s]  like critical. Stagger and damage will increase as he levels up. It's critical. He's got 30% crit
[10801.42s -> 10836.68s]  resistance. Wanda two or rare pug? Three. Rare pawn. Is this a rare pawn? Oh, I'm doing it.
[10841.50s -> 10865.48s]  Cool. Let's see. Top one unlocks a new unit. Well, we got a rare pawn. Go up. I'm going to go. Okay,
[10865.48s -> 10868.36s]  two. I'm going to take. I'm going to make a Tata pawn. That's a Pio Pio.
[10869.16s -> 10884.44s]  On Tama, rare pawn whose critical rate rises gradually as they level up. At level five,
[10884.44s -> 10907.69s]  their attacks become very fast. I can do this like three times. Oh, ho ho. Level two. Yeah,
[10907.69s -> 10928.38s]  I'm doing it. Level three. I did it. Cool. Okay, what about the archers? Maybe I should also do a
[10928.38s -> 10941.53s]  go up and over there as well. The Pio Pio. Yeah, because that's good too. Critical strike on an
[10941.53s -> 10966.36s]  archer. All right, that was cool. Squish. Squish what? Fortress. Edgey cliff.
[10967.40s -> 10971.48s]  Tata pawns head into the skies above where another Carmen fortress stands before them. It's time for
[10971.48s -> 10985.66s]  battle. All right, we got to move some people around, right? That you go over there. Level of
[10985.66s -> 10996.20s]  you. You, not you. Over here. Optimize. Friendship sword, friendship shield.
[11000.92s -> 11011.35s]  Optimize first. You're in the front. That's good. Optimize. You're in the front too. Okay, cool.
[11012.23s -> 11033.37s]  Give it a try. Army looks beefy. Yeah. Oh, they're cold.
[11036.81s -> 11073.35s]  So are they. I turn it into rain? All right, I'm going to make it rain instead. That'll work,
[11073.35s -> 11103.48s]  right? Will it turn to rain? Yeah, it's um, then, then, then. Fucking God. Where's the beat?
[11104.28s -> 11186.15s]  Where's the song? And forward. All right, forward. This song's good. I think it's so big.
[11202.23s -> 11282.22s]  Fire made for a small screen. That makes sense. Here we go. Unbelievable. Forward.
[11282.86s -> 11310.15s]  I'm not hitting myself with my own air hose, right? All right, knock the shit out.
[11311.27s -> 11350.81s]  Now bend. What's the wind look like? Wake up! Jeremy, catapongs are attacking my apartment right
[11350.81s -> 11394.71s]  now. I'm sorry, man. Like you're in that building. Man, that's, that's so funny. It is. That's funny.
[11395.59s -> 11400.01s]  If you don't think so, then you need to go to comedy school. Like that person did.
[11401.13s -> 11408.42s]  Okay, I went, but I, I, you know, whatever. I fucked out.
[11412.86s -> 11419.14s]  Loud strange noises. It's not comedy. It's like, oh, really? You think so?
[11420.74s -> 11437.35s]  He's so fucking smart, though. Aren't I funny?
[11437.35s -> 11481.00s]  He flunked out. Rain again? Oh, more rain. How do you flunk out a clown college? You can't make
[11481.00s -> 11519.74s]  balloon animals. That's like the SATs of clowns. You got to be able to know how to do that. All
[11519.74s -> 11548.33s]  right. I do need to do rain. I said the item's fine. It's going to be there. Currently in a
[11548.33s -> 11559.74s]  clown one-on-one zoom call. Do you have to be in makeup for that? Or is it just like, you know
[11559.74s -> 11572.94s]  what? We, no, we don't have to be in. We're just, we're just here. No more rain. No more fire.
[11574.14s -> 11624.31s]  Not makeup. It's not makeup. What does that mean? Ink? Big walnut. Pick up the walnut.
[11625.11s -> 11629.53s]  Yes. Okay. Don't. It's not analog. It doesn't do anything.
[11643.58s -> 11671.94s]  People are born clowns or not. That's a lot of items. This game looks great. But was it really
[11671.94s -> 11696.79s]  worth $250? It was actually like seven bucks. Did you know that you can change here class
[11696.79s -> 11702.18s]  at the headquarters? Oh, no, that's the guy's name. Do you know that you can change
[11702.98s -> 11705.22s]  a class at the headquarters before you buy
[11720.94s -> 11724.54s]  Oh, wait, we have to watch this when he buries it all.
[11732.23s -> 11746.46s]  Oh, should I, uh, I'm getting some more, uh, yary pond upgrades. I can't. Oh, God, I'm died.
[11747.18s -> 11780.63s]  All right. What am I supposed to say? I could go. I could do a little too. Cool. What about you?
[11784.23s -> 11805.34s]  Yeah. Oh, I want this one. That's this one. A chiku. Nice. Okay. He's not my stuff.
[11806.22s -> 11816.92s]  It's fun. Why does it get so crusty? I don't know. It just kind of does. It just does. Doesn't it?
[11821.11s -> 11836.49s]  Crust is real. Can you change menus? Don't ask me why. Defender of the sky past the impregnable
[11836.49s -> 11841.21s]  mountains. See if the clouds spreads before them. White clouds, black clouds, thunder clouds.
[11841.21s -> 11858.49s]  But this isn't heaven. It's a battleground class. Uh, I'm going to make you a yary pond.
[11861.11s -> 11879.75s]  Steel saber. Optimize. Optimize. Got them all hats. Optimize. Nice. Give hero the good one.
[11881.11s -> 11891.14s]  Oh yeah. You, yeah. Give me this thing. Friendship spear. Get off. Friendship spear. Give it to me.
[11891.78s -> 11918.66s]  Friendship sword. Okay. Let's go. Nothing like a good old friendship sword.
[11919.54s -> 11936.66s]  Look out for that cloud monster. Okay. Pick him up. Lousy patapons.
[11940.22s -> 11975.16s]  The hell is that? Is that it over there? Kill it. Fuck. Oh, can we back up? Holy shit.
[11983.18s -> 11995.26s]  Right. Or a good hit. All right. Now block.
[11995.26s -> 12035.66s]  Got it. Again. Okay. Again. For hours now. Yeah, me too. Is there a way to mute their voices?
[12038.30s -> 12065.99s]  I don't think so. What? That's like a secret. Before it disappears. Get in there. No.
[12065.99s -> 12159.61s]  No. Let's go. Just pick it up. I'm muted. I'm not muted. I'm not. I can see the indicator.
[12160.49s -> 12189.35s]  The streamer can't even unmute. All right. Now five minute break from reading chat. I think
[12189.35s -> 12220.06s]  that sounds good. No. Get that thing. I think it's like a staff. Get a staff. He's in the way.
[12221.42s -> 12276.97s]  Get it. I can't walk by him. I can't walk by him. I can't move by him. I got an egg. My DPS is too
[12276.97s -> 12309.90s]  low. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Security number.
[12314.71s -> 12322.52s]  Why the hell would you put that in here? What's wrong with you? Patapons like to stay clean. So
[12322.52s -> 12327.34s]  they'll run from the smelly game. They pass under an enemy bird. The bird might drop a poopoo on
[12327.34s -> 12341.53s]  them, which would make any patapon upset. Make sure to keep them clean. Lady of the Den. You again,
[12341.53s -> 12345.70s]  let me guess. The scouts have found something terrible. Right. Lady of the Den. How did you
[12345.70s -> 12351.80s]  know? It's a castle up in the clouds. Oh, fuck. What the fuck are you talking about?
[12366.78s -> 12383.08s]  Should I do one of the egg thing again? Sentura egg one. Maybe let's just do a,
[12383.08s -> 12394.82s]  I'll do Sentura one. So who are these little guys that I just get them? This is my hero.
[12401.48s -> 12411.03s]  You have to go over here. Oh, what the fuck is this? Formation.
[12413.94s -> 12417.22s]  He appears on horseback riding with none. His form must be that of a true warrior.
[12417.86s -> 12440.70s]  Oh, that's cool. Does he always have to be in the front? He's doing solo. Oh, this must be okay.
[12441.34s -> 12450.62s]  Let's just go kill this thing. This is for multiplayer. How would multiplayer work in this
[12450.62s -> 12500.44s]  game? You have to do it at the same time. Let's do it. Forgot. Not on the easy mode anymore.
[12501.08s -> 12517.67s]  The four inputs don't work. Forgot. What the fuck? What is going on?
[12537.42s -> 12595.69s]  Get the coins. What are you doing? That's what he does.
[12596.73s -> 12644.86s]  Kill. Come on. Get those coins. Get in there. Get the coins. Is this on PSP? It is. It's being
[12644.86s -> 12675.94s]  played on PlayStation 4 with the remake. Technically the remaster. That's true.
[12675.94s -> 12710.14s]  Get it. Those coins. The remaster. Play everything on a CRTV. Oh, shit.
[12742.55s -> 12802.23s]  Oh, great. I have no fucking idea. Yay. Who did I get? Who is that? Who is that?
[12807.88s -> 12825.02s]  Pura Battle Egg. Spit off to Alita Battle Angel. Didn't do very well at the box-off.
[12829.38s -> 12837.24s]  Disney lost 200 million dollars. Okay, so wait. Did I get the big one or get a bunch of the little
[12837.24s -> 12860.34s]  ones? Take them all away. It's the funniest movie of the year. Let's move. Do you want to change
[12860.34s -> 12876.58s]  Harachari into Pacheng and return? Yeah. Don't be honest. Did you get bogged? Is that why you
[12876.58s -> 12900.04s]  don't go on biz anymore? Hey, dude. Hey, be honest. Did you get bogged? It didn't everybody
[12900.04s -> 12915.80s]  did. What are you talking about? Did I get bogged? Every single person did. All of everyone. He
[12915.80s -> 12925.29s]  admits it. It becomes a crypto rent. I mean, what do you have any more to say? Yes, I was
[12925.29s -> 12933.37s]  responsible. And when BTC reached that $20,000, I was like, yep, it's time to sell it here. And
[12933.37s -> 12938.82s]  this is a good idea. And I'm going to sell it. It went down. Just keep it. It's going to be the new
[12938.82s -> 12946.73s]  paradigm. It's 14,000. Just hold on to it. We're going to get a big rally here. 8,000. I'm telling
[12948.17s -> 12955.85s]  it's going to be the new technology everybody's going to use. What do you want me to say? You
[12955.93s -> 12975.43s]  want to say? Oh, I'm responsible. And I took profits when I should have. Sky Castle of the
[12975.43s -> 12995.19s]  gods. Oh, no, he's angry. He finally admits to getting bogged. Oh, level. Yep. He fell for a get
[12995.19s -> 13008.41s]  rich quick scheme. No, I didn't. Because this is it's still like cryptographic technology. It's
[13008.41s -> 13012.73s]  like a good technology. It's a good it's going to do some good things eventually here. All right.
[13013.69s -> 13022.74s]  Everybody knows that. Come on. Cryptographic techno stuff. Keep telling yourself that.
[13023.46s -> 13030.98s]  I don't have to keep telling myself that. It's even if it's not money. You know, there'll be a
[13030.98s -> 13036.92s]  use for it. It'll be the thing that communicates in your car. The tell it to like turn its engine on.
[13037.64s -> 13042.70s]  And like to be careful. Get all that self driving AI blockchain car. I don't know.
[13043.66s -> 13046.06s]  Oh, let me have to get I have this. Can I have like a little bit of hope, please?
[13046.70s -> 13064.66s]  I think I'm self driving blockchain car would take you'd be like, Okay, time to take a turn
[13064.66s -> 13070.66s]  signal. All right, hold on. About to take a left. First, let me download every single left that's
[13070.66s -> 13084.97s]  ever been taken by every single other car. Okay, almost got it. Okay, now it's time to put my left
[13084.97s -> 13116.65s]  on the next one. Okay, I'm playing the game. I've made 1000s of dollars in crypto in the last month
[13116.65s -> 13122.33s]  alone. I'm so I'm really happy for you. That's great. I that's fucking awesome. I'm really happy
[13122.33s -> 13129.67s]  to hear that. It's gonna do something. It's it look it's like a new technology. Fucking pets.com
[13129.67s -> 13135.75s]  came out and nobody gives a shit anymore. There'll be like an there'll be an Amazon of this of the
[13135.75s -> 13140.23s]  crypto world be a few of them. Probably I don't know. I'm just optimistic. Okay, and I'm glad
[13140.23s -> 13146.71s]  you're making some money. It's cold. Whatever. It's sure it is. Of course it is. What do you want me
[13146.71s -> 13173.00s]  to pretend? He got absolutely bogged. He's delirious. How much money did you lose?
[13175.77s -> 13179.45s]  Um, not enough to be sad, but enough to be annoyed. Let's put it that way.
[13196.18s -> 13203.18s]  100k. If you think a slight annoyance would be from $100,000 in losses.
[13204.14s -> 13208.74s]  Um, I how much money do you think I have?
[13209.62s -> 13229.93s]  Bragging about being a millionaire again with like, what was that face?
[13231.37s -> 13236.95s]  Dude, you're a millionaire. I'm gonna hiss into the mic. I'm gonna hiss into the mic.
[13238.31s -> 13268.01s]  Oh, by the way, I got all the easy bake oven stuff. That's gonna be disgusting. I saw the
[13268.01s -> 13273.18s]  packet for the pizza. I don't want to eat this pizza. It's gonna be fucking revolting.
[13275.34s -> 13301.26s]  I've been making a pizza out of a powdered packet. That's what it is. Guys, even the
[13301.26s -> 13308.46s]  Lunchables. Lunchables pizzas are cold and they're weird. They don't come out of like a powdered
[13308.46s -> 13316.49s]  pouch. It's not, no, I don't even think it's flour. It's some alien liquid. I don't know.
[13319.05s -> 13339.35s]  Wait, get that sword. Get that sword. Somebody touch it. Nice. Thunder sword.
[13342.01s -> 13357.77s]  Huge fog moment. Pressing for those things.
[13360.09s -> 13414.25s]  Shooting? We just came in and said veto. Um, you're about four hours too late. Annihilate.
[13421.54s -> 13441.99s]  Can you move? What's about some other scams you can help with? Um, wait, that's applying that,
[13441.99s -> 13454.55s]  that like, no, that's not a scam. Air restoration. That shit actually works.
[13456.23s -> 13461.08s]  That stuff, it works if you do the right, if you do like surgery or whatever it is.
[13469.51s -> 13474.14s]  Nobody can tell it's not my real hair. Nobody can tell it's not my real hair.
[13475.82s -> 13482.58s]  Because I had a video of me in a pool coming up from under the water and my hair like goes
[13482.58s -> 13499.94s]  back and just look at it. And I look into the camera and I go, it's my real hair.
[13500.50s -> 13506.26s]  And I pretend to yank it and you can clearly tell that I'm not putting any pressure at all on it.
[13507.46s -> 13510.18s]  I'm just like, I'm doing like a pantomime that I'm pulling.
[13513.37s -> 13518.57s]  Why the fuck would I want to like compromise that this hair on TV commercial that I probably got
[13518.57s -> 13544.47s]  paid like $300. Procedure was like 16 grand. Why would I compromise this? What are they saying?
[13546.31s -> 13551.75s]  Oh, but this shit works. It works. That shit actually works.
[13557.62s -> 13622.39s]  Okay, get in. Move closer. Show no mercy. Now the hint. Brain cells.
[13626.09s -> 13631.53s]  Of the sounds and the colors. Pressing the same sequence of buttons over and over again.
[13631.69s -> 13645.35s]  I don't like gamer fatigue. I know what that is.
[13646.79s -> 13679.13s]  You're going to rock you. We dropped something. Go get this items.
[13681.61s -> 13686.90s]  Can I get the items? How do I get the items? It's like a yellow item. I can't get it.
[13691.50s -> 13704.86s]  How do I care about lore when there's items on the ground?
[13705.50s -> 13733.42s]  3D Grinner. Okay, I want to see the new thunder bow. Cool.
[13733.42s -> 13740.28s]  Somewhere in this world hides a dark place known as the underworld. The underworld has
[13740.28s -> 13745.40s]  its own leader with demons and trolls as residents. They can't come to our world on their own,
[13745.40s -> 13751.64s]  but all they need is a special summon to make the trip. Generic ass fucking story.
[13766.58s -> 13773.59s]  I'm like this game a lot. Don't you know I say that? I said the same thing. I got to be careful
[13773.59s -> 13780.07s]  because I did that with Mario Sunshine and I think I got to stop doing that. I got to stop
[13782.36s -> 13788.62s]  shitposting on my own stream. I've done that a couple of times today. I'm going to stop
[13788.62s -> 13801.93s]  shitposting on my own account. I don't like this. Why? Whoa, look at that hair.
[13823.45s -> 13831.96s]  Go all the way to the left? I can't. There's nothing here. There's nothing here. Go left.
[13831.96s -> 13848.84s]  There's nothing here. Wait, what do I mean? Call the guy with the hair?
[13852.14s -> 13867.80s]  There's no more left. Call the guy with the hair. What is going on?
[13869.80s -> 13895.61s]  There'll be something to the left soon. That was fun.
[13904.89s -> 13907.69s]  Those pursuing earth end won't be stopped by a mere blizzard.
[13910.47s -> 13921.54s]  No, we will not. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[13921.54s -> 13930.39s]  wait a minute. What's happening? Thunder sword. Magical sword that harnesses the power of thunder
[13930.39s -> 13935.35s]  to deal critical staggers and knockbacks as well as set fires. I'm going to have to give that
[13936.31s -> 13954.68s]  a gun from. Thunder bow, right? Yeah, there is. Stagger. There's frog. What's frog?
[13955.40s -> 13966.66s]  To the hero. The hero is... I have to make the hero a different class, right? So then you take
[13966.66s -> 13982.38s]  the full shield. I just killed everybody. Take this off. Put on this tin axe. Give me that ice shield
[13982.38s -> 14008.84s]  too. An axe. Thunder sword. Friendship helm. Steel shield. Ice shield. Ice is better. I can
[14008.84s -> 14048.18s]  make you a... Wait a minute. Five to thirty. Yeah, let's go. Let's go. Putting your teeth together
[14048.18s -> 14056.74s]  and that's better. Pairs of peaches. Neither of them. Throw them both in the trash and buy
[14056.74s -> 14084.66s]  nectareans instead. They think they can really cross the snow field. I mean like theoretically
[14084.66s -> 14113.27s]  throw them away. Actually throw them. That big sword. Anime darn these pataphons. Aiming.
[14117.14s -> 14132.78s]  I got a chance to leave. Inhuman, those pataphons are monsters.
[14133.34s -> 14186.33s]  Yeah, defend. You're killing them. Get that flame. Nice throw.
[14188.33s -> 14197.82s]  Rain, dude. All right, I got it. It's a migraine scream. We're probably going to be getting those
[14197.82s -> 14220.78s]  to the end soon. This is kind of turning into a migraine scream, isn't it? Is the rain ritual?
[14221.74s -> 14249.86s]  I actually hate this game. Oh, I don't. The games are on the agenda. Well, No More Heroes 2 is on
[14250.82s -> 14284.65s]  single core brain. Yeah, No More Heroes 2 is going to be on Monday? What day is it? I don't know.
[14284.65s -> 14303.74s]  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. The idea would be No More Heroes 2 and that takes us
[14303.74s -> 14312.87s]  from two screams and then we do Resident Evil 3. Can you hear me? Oh, sorry. No More Heroes 2,
[14312.87s -> 14322.04s]  Monday, Tuesday, and then the idea is then to get that sword and then do Resident Evil 3
[14322.76s -> 14333.14s]  on Wednesday, Thursday, if it takes that long. Resident Evil 3 takes one day,
[14333.14s -> 14361.94s]  like, for instance, on Wednesday and it might take one day. Shit. When's Easy Bake?
[14361.94s -> 14367.30s]  Easy Bake Oven Stream and the Green Screen DLC for Free Stream. It'll be back to back
[14368.98s -> 14380.89s]  on May 15th and 16th. Back to back. Easy Bake Oven Stream will be probably Friday
[14382.76s -> 14397.19s]  and the Green Screen DLC on Saturday. Am I permanently frozen here?
[14398.71s -> 14430.71s]  Just move. Come on, guys. Game's so fun. All right. I got it. When are you going to do a
[14430.71s -> 14438.49s]  cringe stream? Somebody could probably argue that that's every single one. I mean, I'm sure
[14438.49s -> 14444.63s]  there's somebody that would be watching this. I don't like that. I mean, oh, I can't argue with
[14444.63s -> 14478.78s]  that. Just kill them. I'm just going to do it defending only. The wind's too strong. Your hero
[14478.78s -> 14501.67s]  makes you unkillable. Why would I ever? That's awesome. You should do a cringe only stream.
[14501.67s -> 14512.14s]  You mean just like desperately try to be as horrible as possible. Headache stream. I and
[14512.14s -> 14528.90s]  I are, I just, hold on. I'm trying to get after this. You already do that. Hold on. This is a
[14528.90s -> 14535.29s]  torture stream? What? This game's fun. It's just, I mean, just turn, I know you're hearing
[14535.45s -> 14557.91s]  la la la la. Put the mission and goal left. I'm about to beat the mission. Remember who's better,
[14557.91s -> 14580.10s]  Ace of Base or the 90s Beach Boys? Ace of Base. Ace of Base is the ones that I saw the sign
[14580.10s -> 14606.70s]  and it opened up my eyes. I saw the sign. That's, is that Ace of Base? That pot. Get that pot.
[14606.70s -> 14622.34s]  I'm out of pots, dude. I got, I'm out of pots. I'm potting. I'm potting. That's the, that's the,
[14622.42s -> 14641.91s]  that's the cringe content I'm looking for. That's the real cringe content. Don't say that. There it
[14641.91s -> 14688.23s]  is. I'm losing my mind. Hero makes you take no damage. This is great actually. Viewers are
[14688.23s -> 14697.50s]  plummeting. I think that already happened back when I was arguing with you guys about the input
[14697.50s -> 14703.26s]  delay and thousands of people were just like, ah, fucking out of here. This is, I'm done with this
[14703.26s -> 14732.38s]  for one. We're the true fans. We, I feel like I'm fighting the same three people here for
[14732.38s -> 14745.67s]  15 straight minutes. We stayed for the input delay stream. Oh, mega lol. I still had fun. I mean,
[14745.67s -> 14782.10s]  this game is fun. There's the ice foresters finally. I like the RPG elements. This is not
[14782.10s -> 14797.22s]  the final boss. No way. I need more rain. Can I get these guys closer? Get in closer. Closer.
[14799.80s -> 14828.33s]  All right. Now, the pen. Game's 25 hours long. Plenty of content. Maybe I'm not strong enough.
[14828.33s -> 14841.29s]  Maybe I was supposed to grind. They definitely use this kind of stuff in Guantanamo.
[14851.46s -> 14879.96s]  You consider and play this? It's not, you guys are overreacting. Come on. It's like
[14879.96s -> 14899.69s]  my alarm clock won't turn off. It's, don't worry. Don't make me laugh right now.
[14900.33s -> 14933.70s]  I did it. Kill, kill, kill, kill. Yeah. Hey, do a game mute sound joke. Come on, relax, relax.
[14934.34s -> 14940.47s]  I don't want to have to start banning people. Remember, a wave of my finger and you're gone.
[14941.11s -> 14983.90s]  I did it. I say the word, you're out of here. Don't ever forget that. Okay. Now follow the guy that
[14983.90s -> 15000.73s]  go to the left, right? The streamer gave me a headache and then banned me. Well, I never told
[15000.81s -> 15005.69s]  you to turn the volume up all the way and put your eyes, so the wet part of your eyes is touching
[15005.69s -> 15016.94s]  your monitor. I didn't tell you to do that. Left one, two, three, one, two, three. Oh, the
[15016.94s -> 15022.62s]  mighty Jerry. I'm delighted. I am to meet you. I'm fabulous. I'm the fabulous dance instructor.
[15022.62s -> 15027.82s]  Sharaba Yapon, master of the disco, foxtrot, polka, and waltz. The mission is in life. It's
[15027.82s -> 15032.30s]  great. The most fabulous dancers. I love people who are practicing right here. I'll be able to
[15032.30s -> 15036.86s]  versus training. My name is master of disco. It'll be my honor to teach you a good movie.
[15037.74s -> 15042.17s]  Okay. Right here. Behold the amazing things to my build pupils. All right, let's do it.
[15044.22s -> 15051.82s]  Yes, I guess. Cafeteria meals. Okay. Meat. Here, take a walnut. I don't take one of these. What
[15051.82s -> 15064.70s]  should I give? What do I give? What do I give? A map? Stick? Give a wooden branch?
[15078.04s -> 15092.90s]  The as a rich person's doorbell. I may not be too smart, but I'll do the best I can. Please teach
[15092.90s -> 15107.38s]  me to dance. Great, Jerry. Have you danced to this song before? No. What button is that?
[15107.38s -> 15121.42s]  The important notes scroll across the screen. When a note gets there, press O. As long as we keep on
[15121.42s -> 15127.42s]  dancing, the notes will keep on passing. When you see a whole bunch of notes coming through, press
[15127.42s -> 15137.32s]  the circle button as many times as you can. Go nuts. The more times you press, the more kaching
[15137.32s -> 15147.21s]  that'll pay. Now instructor, I'm ready to begin. If you press O in time for notes, Sharaba Yapon
[15147.21s -> 15184.73s]  will wave his batons to help you dance along. Dance. More fun than the actual game. The blob
[15184.73s -> 15206.38s]  two waiting room. Understood. Okay. How about level two, level one? Is this level correct?
[15206.38s -> 15218.73s]  That was fun. Into the stream voice. He sounds like you. He does not sound like you.
[15219.37s -> 15231.96s]  Into the stream. How can you hate this game and then play gotcha force for 15
[15231.96s -> 15235.88s]  hours with its one song? I didn't, I never told you I hated this game.
[15236.52s -> 15241.64s]  You are implanting that as I'm being asked. I'm being, that's not, I never said that. I didn't say
[15241.64s -> 15255.38s]  that. Oh, left again. What's a better Olympic sport term, a trampoline or the ribbon dancing?
[15255.38s -> 15260.98s]  The ribbon dancing is the, is the best sport in the Olympics completely. It's just the coolest
[15260.98s -> 15266.73s]  thing that, I mean, trampolines is cool, but the ribbon dancing is way cooler. What are the tree?
[15268.17s -> 15292.65s]  What do you want? You missed it. Like this, nothing here. I'm gonna call it here. We're
[15292.65s -> 15303.54s]  gonna hang out for the bits. We'll chill for like probably like an hour. He hates it. No, he doesn't.
[15304.10s -> 15315.38s]  Just trying to adhere to his schedule. What would you give for a grade? Seven out of 10.
[15321.67s -> 15331.32s]  He just decided to torture his chat today. I can't, I don't, I don't, I think it's, I think
[15331.32s -> 15340.73s]  it's cool. I think it's cute. I think it's fun. I think there's a lot of depth. He will never beat
[15340.73s -> 15362.70s]  Groyo Groyo. A strong seven. Um, it's very, very strong. I'm so glad that Jerma hates chat. Why
[15362.70s -> 15368.55s]  would you be glad about something that's not even true? No, I, I, I can't wait. I can't give
[15368.55s -> 15372.89s]  something a grade that I played for like four hours. It's like a 25 hour game and I played it
[15372.89s -> 15380.44s]  for like four or five hours to check it out and see if I liked it. I liked it. I can't be like,
[15380.44s -> 15392.39s]  ah, it was an A plus. I don't know. It could be. What would you rate us? Um, that changes between
[15392.39s -> 15409.11s]  Monday and Friday. On like Tuesday, maybe sometimes maybe you guys could be a six. On like Thursdays,
[15409.11s -> 15416.47s]  you might be a nine. Saturday? Oh, that's where the fives come out. Sunday? That's where the
[15416.47s -> 15422.55s]  fives come out. Monday? Fives come out. Tuesday, usually sixes come out. Wednesday, usually the
[15422.55s -> 15431.51s]  eights or the nines. Thursday, probably like sixes. Wait, what's today? I didn't give a day. I know.
[15431.51s -> 15449.90s]  Oh, I didn't give a grade for Thursday. Ah, Thursday. Oh, you guys are great. I'm fucking
[15449.90s -> 15458.54s]  kidding. Relax. You guys are always a fucking, at least 8.5, at least a nine. First of all,
[15458.54s -> 15465.82s]  I don't get a 10 because somebody says I have big zits on my forehead. If I turn my face cam on,
[15465.82s -> 15479.72s]  that brings you all down. It brings you all down to a fucking nine. If everybody in the room got
[15479.72s -> 15487.46s]  an A on their test and two people get an F, um, sorry, but the collective class was like a B plus.
[15488.26s -> 15504.02s]  That's just how it works. Oh no, I got an F out of 4,000 students. No, I'm saying if you got like a,
[15506.36s -> 15513.30s]  that wouldn't even like move the needle. If you had like 4,000 A's and like two F's,
[15515.62s -> 15522.04s]  they wouldn't even affect the grade. You can hear the bogged in his voice.
[15523.24s -> 15529.51s]  Nah, I'll see you guys on Monday. We're going to do No More Heroes. We're going to do Monday,
[15529.51s -> 15537.88s]  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. And then we're going to do another community content night
[15538.44s -> 15548.38s]  because I want to catch it up. We'll do another community content night probably on somewhere.
[15551.42s -> 15558.82s]  Let's see. You know, no, you know what? This makes perfect sense. You ready? We're going to do,
[15561.34s -> 15569.78s]  it'll end up being Thursday the 14th because that's, that's like perfect timing because then
[15569.78s -> 15573.38s]  it's Thursday the 14th will be community content night. Friday would be Easy Bay Govan and then
[15573.38s -> 15581.99s]  Saturday will be DLC for free green screen. So in like, like two weeks from now. Exactly.
[15582.71s -> 15591.43s]  But I'll see you Monday. We're going to start and complete No More Heroes 2 and then we're going to
[15591.43s -> 15597.67s]  start and complete Resident Evil 3. And then if we still have time on Thursday, if I don't beat it
[15597.67s -> 15609.40s]  on Thursday or on Wednesday, we will do something else. That sounds like a good plan to me, but
[15609.40s -> 15614.76s]  we'll see you soon. Thanks for watching. Thanks for spending your last week. Thanks for spending
[15614.76s -> 15620.31s]  your middle of your week with me or the beginning of your week until now. Yeah. Thanks for spending
[15620.31s -> 15628.23s]  it with me. We have fun. You're definitely going to beat it in one stream. Even these weak ass
[15628.23s -> 15648.17s]  short streams. The game, weak ass short stream. I'm trying to get healthy. God damn it. This was
[15648.17s -> 15656.95s]  good to hear you. You better do another 12 hour stream someday. That's never going to happen.
[15664.22s -> 15679.83s]  Stop smoking. I don't smoke. He got soft. Whatever it is, he got something. Whatever,
[15679.83s -> 15686.14s]  whatever weird bone disease I have, I've, I got it. I don't know. It just happened. Shit happens.
[15686.78s -> 15702.20s]  Oh, we'll see on Monday. He's got boneitis, pretzel bones.
[15703.48s -> 15710.87s]  It must be from all the donkey donuts. You're going to do no more streaming on weekends.
[15711.83s -> 15724.09s]  Um, no, that's just kind of how it, this is, I mean, Friday and Saturday, we have a plan for
[15724.09s -> 15731.58s]  Thursday, Friday, Saturday for the, what? It's just how it plays out, you know, four days in a row,
[15731.58s -> 15736.54s]  like three days, four days, three days, five days is kind of how it just plays out with the new
[15736.54s -> 15754.12s]  schedule. I want to try. Tweet about it so you don't forget it. Do a face cam. You're too
[15754.12s -> 15760.65s]  self-conscious. I already did. He's got a germ. I'm sorry. The game sucks. Why is everybody saying
[15760.65s -> 15766.92s]  that? It's no, it's because I did the stupid comedy thing where I was like, it's fucking
[15766.92s -> 15771.80s]  game. Stupid fucking goddamn fucking game sucks. It's fucking terrible. Like I, I tell I gotta
[15771.80s -> 15776.55s]  stop doing that. I have to stop shit posting it on my own stream. I got to stop doing that.
[15776.55s -> 15794.49s]  I'm not doing that anymore. No more jokes, but let's, uh, let's do the bits. See you Monday.
[15795.05s -> 15805.00s]  Stop denying the fact that you wanted to stab your thumbs through those juicy pat upon eyes
[15805.00s -> 15816.81s]  and watch them squirm omega low. That's not, that's not an omega low scenario. That's a, uh,
[15820.52s -> 15830.01s]  that's a monk S scenario. That's an actual omega psycho. All right. I'll see you Monday. Let's do
[15830.01s -> 15834.70s]  the bits. We have two 50 from pigeon. Jeremy, you cannot title your stream. The marching band.
[15834.70s -> 15837.66s]  I thought I meant you finally hired the high school marching band. You said you would on the
[15837.66s -> 15846.87s]  official podcast. And I got so hyped just for this. Just kidding. That's it. I, uh, that's,
[15846.87s -> 15853.27s]  I promise you one day that'll happen before I stop streaming forever. Whenever that date is,
[15855.51s -> 15862.87s]  there will be a full 20 plus person in full costume marching band on this stream. I promise
[15862.87s -> 15867.75s]  without even no, no good audio either. Do like just the regular mic. I promise. I fucking promise
[15867.75s -> 15875.45s]  it's going to happen. It has to AC 4G. Thanks for the two 50. What's the status on the resident evil
[15875.45s -> 15882.65s]  three stream. But I, there you go. I hope you're here. Talked about it. Well, it's going to be
[15882.65s -> 15896.18s]  happening next week on Wednesday, Wednesday, Wednesday, Wednesday. Should be fun. Hey, Lando
[15896.18s -> 15900.26s]  Bando. Thanks for the two 50. Hey there, big J. You've inspired so many of my creative endeavors.
[15900.26s -> 15905.14s]  So now I'm working on a German mockumentary where I tour around Boston to important places
[15905.14s -> 15914.97s]  such as the donkey doughnuts, where you were born as you chase me. Also, you should play
[15914.97s -> 15920.01s]  blood bowl too. It's kind of like the league, but all this kind of like blitz, the league,
[15920.01s -> 15925.32s]  but all the stupidity has been brought up to 11 helicopters, crash, fantasy races,
[15925.32s -> 15936.63s]  and straight up killing the other team. Is that really what I'm going to look into that. It seems
[15936.63s -> 15946.04s]  fun. Thanks for the two 50. And here comes a mockumentary sticks renegade. Thanks for two 50.
[15946.04s -> 15951.00s]  Hey there. Hey Jerry. Remember if you cannot play Jackie Chan stunt master within 10 years,
[15951.00s -> 15954.60s]  you automatically admit that Willy Wonka 2005 is better Wonka movie.
[15954.60s -> 15965.10s]  Jerma Grin. That's fine. Not going to happen. X in X. Thanks for the two 50. When's toon town?
[15965.10s -> 15978.02s]  It'll probably happen at the end of May. I would guess a drum major. Thanks for the two 50. Happy
[15978.02s -> 15984.12s]  May day, Jerma. Today all over Europe, we celebrate spring and the workers day here in Finland. It's
[15984.12s -> 15988.68s]  one of the four major holidays there are. The tradition of those graduated from
[15988.68s -> 15994.20s]  Lucio, probably closest to senior high school in the US school system. They go out to parks and get
[15994.20s -> 15999.24s]  wasted while wearing their graduation capes, which sadly isn't possible this year due to Corona.
[15999.24s -> 16004.33s]  Do you celebrate it all in the States? Here's a few picks to give you an idea.
[16004.33s -> 16017.82s]  Um, not, I mean, people have like grad, people had graduation parties where yeah, it would be like,
[16017.82s -> 16023.66s]  oh, like we graduated, let's hang out. But also you have to remember, um, he's talking about
[16023.66s -> 16031.05s]  going out and like having drinks. Uh, the drinking age in the United States is 21. So you can't,
[16031.05s -> 16036.41s]  we, you can't like go out and get drinks and have, get drinks when you're 17, 18, 19,
[16036.41s -> 16044.81s]  drinking age is 21. So it was more of a grill food outside and have people have your friends
[16044.81s -> 16060.90s]  and family come over and give you cards with like $20 bills and more so how that happened.
[16060.90s -> 16068.84s]  So not necessarily the same thing. What is, um, I'm just, just out of curiosity.
[16068.84s -> 16074.44s]  What is the drinking age in Finland? What's like the, the, the legal drinking age in Finland,
[16074.44s -> 16087.13s]  the 18, 16, 18, probably 18. A lot of the European countries are somewhere, what 18 and some of them
[16087.13s -> 16100.79s]  even lower than that, right? 18, 20 for alcohol over 21%. Huh. You're in Denmark. It's 15.
[16100.79s -> 16113.24s]  Germany is 16, 16 in Germany. Yeah. So it's weird. It's as an American,
[16113.88s -> 16122.12s]  it's so weird to think about that at like 16, you could like legally drink alcohol. That's like such
[16122.12s -> 16134.94s]  a foreign concept to me. Wow. What? No, you can't, you can't do that. You're not 21. Are you? How do
[16134.94s -> 16145.62s]  you? It's interesting. People drink anyway. Don't be ridiculous. Oh, I'm talking about
[16146.58s -> 16160.95s]  in a legal sense. Like you, you can't go into the, into the grocery store guys at 16 and buy
[16160.95s -> 16182.36s]  like beer. You can in Germany. Like that's, it's just so different. You can't go and do it. Period.
[16183.00s -> 16196.94s]  Oh, it depends on where you are. Yeah. But, um, we don't know. That's, that's not something that we
[16196.94s -> 16203.48s]  really do. At least I didn't do it just because it was, it was more like a family get together
[16203.48s -> 16213.00s]  and it was like, have like a big party with your friends crazy that we can draft someone,
[16213.00s -> 16223.37s]  but not let them drink. Yeah. Where did the, well, okay. I know it's like the age of being
[16223.37s -> 16228.89s]  knighted, right? Isn't 21. Is that even real? Or is that just like a fake article I read one day?
[16229.53s -> 16234.06s]  Wasn't it like, Oh, the nights got night at a 21 or something.
[16234.94s -> 16250.74s]  Mike, because that's fake. That's a, why is it 21? That's an anime plot. Anime laws.
[16262.36s -> 16272.28s]  But like you, you're considered an illegal adult. You're an adult at 18 and you're an adult. You can
[16272.92s -> 16275.96s]  but know that now like cigarettes are now moving to 21 all over the place too.
[16279.50s -> 16292.94s]  A lot of like to buy cigarettes, 21, which it was, it's been, it was 18 for decades and decades.
[16301.85s -> 16305.85s]  No, no, I meant you celebrate May day, not graduation day from high school.
[16308.22s -> 16316.01s]  No, that's not really a thing here. Most of the, I mean, most of the holidays that are in the
[16316.01s -> 16323.10s]  summer, like this late spring and in the summer, and you're talking about, I mean, this it's May
[16323.10s -> 16332.46s]  day, May day, but like Memorial day, right? Memorial day with the July, there's a bunch of
[16332.46s -> 16351.69s]  things that we do. July 4th. Yeah. But not in particular May day. No, I wanted to say Zyxia
[16351.69s -> 16357.37s]  again gave a hundred community subs, which is fucking crazy. It's just so many subs to give it
[16357.37s -> 16365.22s]  in one second. I really hope you can afford it. That's a lot of money to give somebody ever.
[16366.73s -> 16375.27s]  Thank you, Zyxia. Do a drunk stream, please. I just did. I just did like four or five days ago.
[16385.08s -> 16390.84s]  Hey, nope. Thanks for the 500 bits. Yo jumbo. I just wanted to say thanks for streaming. Gotcha
[16390.84s -> 16395.96s]  farts the last few days. It helped me fall asleep and fix my sleeping schedule. Smiley face, no space.
[16396.60s -> 16404.47s]  Thank you. Hey fishies. Thanks for $5. I've been a long time watcher since 2012 and I've been subbed
[16404.47s -> 16408.87s]  ever since I found your Twitch channel, but this is my first time donating. Well, fishies,
[16409.75s -> 16414.95s]  thanks for the $5. Thanks for donating. I feel like you deserve more than just a sub. I want
[16414.95s -> 16418.79s]  to make sure how you know how much all of us in the community appreciate what you do for us.
[16418.79s -> 16422.23s]  No matter what game you play or how long you're online, your streams always make me smile. I just
[16422.23s -> 16437.67s]  want to say thank you for being you and never change. I appreciate that, but a sub is you're
[16437.67s -> 16443.19s]  kind of paying for it already. You know what I mean? Like if you are subbed to the channel,
[16444.82s -> 16450.98s]  you know, you talk about that, you get, that's like $5 a month. You're already contributing.
[16451.06s -> 16456.30s]  Like that's, that's already more than I could ever ask anybody to do. So if you've subbed to
[16456.30s -> 16461.08s]  the channel, you don't, you don't feel, don't feel like you have to, oh no, I want to get,
[16461.08s -> 16470.23s]  I have to give more. You don't have to. If you, you don't have to give anything.
[16474.15s -> 16477.27s]  Being subbed to the channel and thinking I have to give more money,
[16479.05s -> 16496.50s]  something I really hope people don't really think they have to do. You're worth donating to. If you
[16496.50s -> 16509.06s]  think that, then that's, that's for you to decide. But I've, I've, I've toyed with the idea.
[16511.51s -> 16518.06s]  And I mean, this, this is, this is just all hypotheticals and all, um, just thought project
[16518.06s -> 16523.96s]  in quotes. Those of you that remember from a while ago, it, I, I never had a donation link.
[16523.96s -> 16528.20s]  I never had one. It was always something that I was like, I don't really want to do that
[16528.84s -> 16533.85s]  because people sub your sub, you already paid for it, whatever. And then when bits came along,
[16533.85s -> 16541.64s]  it was like, oh, I guess it took me a while to kind of be okay with it and like, want to do it.
[16541.64s -> 16550.25s]  And I think about stuff sometimes if, what if there was no bits? What if you could just sub
[16550.25s -> 16572.97s]  to this channel? Sometimes I think about that. Community subs would be insane and you'd have to
[16572.97s -> 16588.76s]  bring back sub sounds. Imagine there's no bits. It isn't hard to do. Oh, I see what you're doing.
[16594.78s -> 16597.98s]  I think about this kind of stuff all the time where it's like, well, what, what if you just like,
[16597.98s -> 16603.42s]  okay, you've, it's fine. You pay, you, you just optionally pay $5 a month if you feel like it.
[16605.59s -> 16609.43s]  Like it's not, oh, I, I, I want to give you more money. I want to give you like
[16609.43s -> 16615.59s]  5,000 more dollars. Like essentially like an optional Netflix subscription,
[16616.31s -> 16634.14s]  Patreon, but, and then, well, what happens to stuff like this?
[16640.92s -> 16646.17s]  Is it, it's worth it if you're going to keep streaming? Yeah, I've, I've no, nothing would
[16646.17s -> 16658.22s]  change. It would just be like monetarily speaking, subscriptions would be like the only
[16658.22s -> 16665.88s]  form of this channel bringing in like money. And this is not something I'm saying I'm going to do,
[16666.76s -> 16677.11s]  but I don't know. It's something to think about. I don't do Patreon.
[16677.11s -> 16685.83s]  Thought project for the day. He's thinking of ways to make less money.
[16687.02s -> 16705.34s]  I mean, that's no less money equals less carnivals. That, but that's not even necessarily true.
[16710.46s -> 16721.91s]  Set chat to true fans only mode, less clowns. No, no, no. Five million. He already has too much
[16721.91s -> 16735.38s]  money, but to move on from that, I just something to think about not happening. No worry. I'm going
[16735.38s -> 16743.10s]  to keep those bits on released a little while longer. Just a few more. That's it. Just a couple
[16743.10s -> 16760.33s]  more of those bits. Let us pay you. I look, but you do. You, you do. Like you don't pay Netflix
[16760.33s -> 16778.63s]  extra money a month. I'm sure they'd take it. Who cares about them? Yeah. Netflix each shit.
[16785.69s -> 16788.49s]  You are at Netflix. You're yeah. But that's what I mean. Like optional.
[16789.21s -> 16808.65s]  Like it is now Netflix doesn't have easy bake oven. Yeah. It's just a thought. I'm just,
[16808.65s -> 16813.85s]  I'm just giving hypotheticals and kind of seeing what you guys think about it. We can move on.
[16813.85s -> 16816.89s]  It's not happening. This is not like, by the way, next week, there's bits of deleted.
[16817.45s -> 16826.23s]  Just want to see what you guys had to say about, Hey, Nope. Thanks for the $5. Yo jumbo. Just want
[16826.23s -> 16837.75s]  to say thanks for streaming. Gotcha. Far. It's already read this one. Hey, hey, sick. Ik sick.
[16837.75s -> 16848.02s]  Ikka sick. Ikka sick six. It's pronounced six. Ikka. All right. I got it right. Thank you. Six
[16848.02s -> 16858.62s]  Ikka for the six Ikka. Yeah, I got it. Thank you. Six Ikka for the thousand it's and your
[16858.62s -> 16872.10s]  hundred community subs. I say Zyxia. It's hard for me to forget and hard for me to learn new words.
[16878.17s -> 16881.77s]  Thanks for the huge amount of money. Hopefully I got your name right.
[16882.65s -> 16888.76s]  The chef's corner. Thanks for the thousand bits. Jeremiah Elberton is not real. Please
[16888.76s -> 16897.78s]  refrain from attacking thus weak point from massive damage. Jerma hates Fortnite. I don't
[16897.78s -> 16905.74s]  hate Fortnite. I just hate playing Fortnite. There's a difference there. Stains. Thanks for
[16905.74s -> 16912.60s]  the 250. Your hair is great. No matter what they say. King. Thank you. Hey, Locky man. Thanks for
[16912.60s -> 16924.01s]  $5. I always enjoy watching you play rhythm games. Keep up the good work. Hey, the funky man. Thanks
[16924.01s -> 16928.52s]  for the 300 bits. Hey, my mom got me these bits because she wanted me to tell you she thinks you
[16928.52s -> 16934.60s]  are hot. I'm not kidding. She actually did. So here's her Instagram. Please message her or
[16934.60s -> 16954.33s]  she'll keep bothering me about it. I appreciate the compliment. I'm currently in a relationship
[16955.05s -> 16965.56s]  and I am everything is going great and everything's cool. I don't I'm sorry, but I am me.
[16967.16s -> 16972.60s]  I have words coming out of my mouth. I really appreciate the comment. I appreciate. I'm happy
[16972.60s -> 16988.26s]  to hear it. Okay, I don't even want to let's go. Hey, thanks for the $5. Jeremy, do you call Otto
[16988.26s -> 17008.07s]  your furry boy that make you and Kim his skin parents? No, actually his name we call Otto. We
[17008.07s -> 17017.64s]  call them Mr. Horace Zonto for a couple of particular reasons. Because he went in bed.
[17019.91s -> 17025.59s]  He always sleeps. He never sleeps vertical. He always sleeps horizontally. And he's kind of just
[17025.59s -> 17029.83s]  gets in the way. Oh, he's in the way. Oh, he's horizontal. Oh, come on. What are you doing,
[17029.83s -> 17041.93s]  Mr. Horace Zonto? Horace Zonto. That's weird. When I'm even vertical, like he sleeps like
[17041.93s -> 17046.17s]  a horizontally on the bed, not like vertical like a human. So he's kind of gets in the way.
[17046.81s -> 17056.68s]  We call him Horace Zonto. You're gonna minus two, like a little fun name I give my dog.
[17059.38s -> 17065.94s]  I didn't preface that by going, Okay, I got some funny to tell you. My dog, right? He's a dog.
[17067.38s -> 17075.16s]  That's not even a joke. That's not that I shouldn't even told you. It's like a me and Kim thing.
[17075.16s -> 17078.84s]  Can't believe I just like told you guys that I just like let you I just like got the looking glass
[17078.84s -> 17085.30s]  and got to see into my private life. And it just throws back in my face. See if I share anything
[17085.30s -> 17102.49s]  else with you guys again. I can't wait to a blue screen of death to a symbiotic entity. Thanks for
[17102.49s -> 17111.67s]  the five community subs local IRS agent. Thanks for the $5 local IRS agent. Thanks for five more
[17111.67s -> 17116.47s]  dollars. Hey, Jeremy, you haven't returned our calls about our findings. It's come to our attention
[17116.47s -> 17121.27s]  from a very reliable source that you were in fact, a million dollar streamer will be taking
[17121.27s -> 17135.43s]  our cut of the dough next tax season. Hey, thanks for the $10. Do I get to deduct that?
[17136.95s -> 17150.50s]  I can can I deduct this? Or what would this count as? Now I owe 10 more dollars. 1 million and 10.
[17152.57s -> 17166.17s]  Fucking millionaire streamer thing. Check his account he has in the Bahamas. Talking about how
[17166.17s -> 17179.99s]  bad I'm getting bogged. And we think we think I got a million dollars. Hey, goiki. Thanks for the
[17179.99s -> 17219.45s]  500 bits. Beyond bogs. Beyond boggers. Beyond meat, man. But thank you, goiki. Thanks for the $5,
[17219.45s -> 17226.58s]  goiki. My sister borrowed my PayPal and asked me why I spent nearly $150 on Twitch this week.
[17227.22s -> 17233.96s]  And I hadn't the heart to tell her they were important expenses to appease an e-clown. In
[17233.96s -> 17237.80s]  all seriousness though, I don't know what else I'd spend it on rather than someone who brings me so
[17237.80s -> 17257.00s]  much happiness. So here's five more dollars to the bank. Please. The bank will be pleased.
[17258.42s -> 17264.82s]  Maybe maybe your girlfriend. Wait, you didn't you know, why are you guys saying girlfriend?
[17264.82s -> 17286.82s]  It's a sister. Take your sister out to a nice steak dinner. Thanks for the $5 though.
[17287.54s -> 17296.36s]  Hey, S Halukko. Thanks for the 250. What is the best pasta shape and why is it Casa Ricis?
[17297.16s -> 17303.72s]  Also, thanks for all the laughs. The best pasta is angel hair pasta. Angel hair like spaghetti.
[17304.28s -> 17319.45s]  Either that or big sloppy fettuccine noodles. Just absolutely just soaking, slathered in sauce.
[17320.25s -> 17326.09s]  Just slathered in fettuccine Alfredo sauce with crispy sliced up chicken. All right, I'm hungry.
[17326.09s -> 17348.09s]  Bye. See you guys on Monday. Olive oil. Good olive oil. Good one. Yeah, yeah, that's gonna be
[17348.73s -> 17355.54s]  good. Welcome to barbecue pit boys.com. Today we're going to be making some barbecue
[17355.54s -> 17365.88s]  stuffed hamburgers on the grill. Man gonna be good. Oh, you're getting hungry or what?
[17366.44s -> 17383.38s]  I watch every single one of their videos. For real though, thanks for the 250. Enough of these
[17383.38s -> 17392.28s]  baby games. Play mercenaries playground of destruction. Holy shit. I bought that game
[17393.90s -> 17399.30s]  like eight months ago and I was going to play it eight months ago and just be like, hey, that's
[17399.30s -> 17406.04s]  what we're doing today and I just forgot. All right, I gotta get that done. I can do that soon.
[17406.76s -> 17412.52s]  The game looks insane. Yeah, we'll do that very soon. Don't let me forget about that because I
[17412.52s -> 17419.08s]  will after about 10 minutes after the stream ends. Mercenaries too. Yeah, that's the one. Hey,
[17419.08s -> 17427.11s]  Wembley TTV. Thanks for the 250. Do you know what day it is today? It's Thursday. Thursday for me.
[17429.42s -> 17433.10s]  Gurus say thanks for the 300 bits. Hey bro, I just finished high school tonight. Graduating
[17433.10s -> 17438.86s]  early because of online school. Thanks again for all you do. Congratulations. Close that book and
[17438.86s -> 17445.19s]  open a new one. Open a new one. Close that book and open a new one. Remember when you're on that
[17445.19s -> 17452.98s]  highway. Forward. There ain't no brakes on the highway. No slowing down. No going back. You
[17452.98s -> 17467.35s]  don't turn around on the highway. Forward. Miss the exit. Gosh, it's okay. Get off of the next one.
[17467.35s -> 17478.44s]  Nah, seriously though, congrats. Thanks for the motivation, Jeremy. You're welcome. Do you guys
[17478.44s -> 17484.41s]  think I could make a career out of being that voice on the radio that comes on and sounds like
[17484.41s -> 17499.53s]  this? I guess I could. Are you serious? You want to talk about like a millionaire? Just absolutely
[17499.53s -> 17511.53s]  throw myself out there and just do 500 of those a day. If I do like 500 of these voice radio
[17511.53s -> 17516.46s]  commercials, that's a million dollars right there. That's easy. Each one is worth how much? Okay,
[17516.46s -> 17525.34s]  let's do some math. Let's say each one's worth what? Like 300 bucks? 400 bucks? 300 bucks?
[17525.34s -> 17533.61s]  Let's just say 300 bucks times a thousand. That's 300,000 dollars and then take that to the casino
[17533.61s -> 17561.38s]  and put it all on on black. That's 600,000. Write a children's book. If you make a million dollars,
[17561.38s -> 17579.10s]  you would only gain one fifth of your net worth, Jeremy. What do you mean a fifth? I would only
[17579.10s -> 17596.84s]  gain one fifth. What are you talking about? Because of like taxes? They're claiming you're
[17596.84s -> 17616.58s]  worth five million already. No, guys, I'm like an idle game. If I ever got close to a million dollars,
[17616.58s -> 17624.18s]  it would just be removed because I would do like a fucking ultra carnival. Every time I get close,
[17624.90s -> 17628.42s]  it would just be constant idle game. Like I would never, it would never cross a million. It would
[17628.42s -> 17649.88s]  never happen. It admits he's been close. No, not even close. Not even remotely close. Not,
[17649.88s -> 17657.21s]  not even halfway there. Not even, not even a quarter of the way there. Not even, not even
[17659.03s -> 17677.53s]  like a tenth of the way there. You guys got to remove some zeros. He's a hundred K
[17678.41s -> 17695.00s]  heir. 90K after the whole beyond meat thing.
[17706.95s -> 17713.08s]  Are you still in debt from the live rumble? Did I ever talk? You know what? It's been long enough.
[17713.88s -> 17720.98s]  Have I ever talked about where I got the money for the live rumble? Do we talk about this yet?
[17724.36s -> 17744.17s]  No, we haven't. We have not. Have we not talked about it? Um, I, uh, I drew from my retirement
[17744.25s -> 17777.18s]  account and liquidated it. It's true, but it's okay. I take it back. He's broke.
[17777.90s -> 17785.70s]  Did you invest in a new one? I did. I don't know. Everything's fine. Don't worry. I was like,
[17785.70s -> 17793.75s]  all right, how do I, uh, uh, I'm doing this. How much does it cost to do this? Oh,
[17796.82s -> 17805.69s]  $10,000 to make this video. Oh, let's go. Well, how much more do I need?
[17809.19s -> 17832.15s]  And he liquidated the new one for the carnival. No, somebody said something.
[17835.35s -> 17839.59s]  This doesn't count as a retirement. Uh, I don't want to even, I don't even want to even go there,
[17839.59s -> 17855.70s]  but what you said is fucking funny. Uh, no, how much was the carnival? Um, I, it hasn't been long
[17855.70s -> 17860.86s]  enough. It hasn't been long enough. It hasn't been long enough. It has to be like three years
[17861.58s -> 17913.22s]  for me to say it. It's been three years. It's been three dog years. It was $40,000. He's broke.
[17914.42s -> 17927.24s]  Who are those estimates at again for how much money I have? Uh, no, I'll be real with you.
[17927.24s -> 17936.30s]  Let's be real. Ready? Let's get real for a second. Um, if I want to do something and I think it will
[17936.30s -> 17944.95s]  be fun, I'm going to do it. I'm just going to fucking do it. And if I have like the capital
[17945.91s -> 17957.91s]  to do it, I'm going to do it. Did you get any profit from the carnival? Um, well, that depends
[17957.91s -> 17966.52s]  on how you look at that, right? Because no, no jokes, no fucking around. Like let's get serious.
[17967.16s -> 17973.37s]  There's been a huge amount of attention on this channel since then, but just there has been,
[17973.37s -> 17979.61s]  and a lot of new people have showed up. A lot of people are here and the channel has grown a lot
[17979.61s -> 17992.66s]  since then. So I don't know over the, over the year of, of, I'm not looking for a return though.
[17992.66s -> 17997.54s]  Like that's a, I'm not, I don't look at it that way. It's like, did it, was that fun? Did people
[17997.54s -> 18001.78s]  like it? And did a bunch of people have a good time and was it worth doing? I think, I think it was
[18010.95s -> 18019.80s]  and mean some things, things cost money and I'm going to pay for them if I can. And that doesn't
[18019.80s -> 18027.35s]  mean I've used every cent I own, right? Like I would, I would never put myself in any real,
[18028.07s -> 18034.01s]  like financial danger. I hope you guys understand that. There was an opportunity,
[18036.44s -> 18043.45s]  then I took it. Do I have a safe savings? I do. I don't worry. I have a retirement account and it's
[18043.45s -> 18053.50s]  doing fine. I have, don't worry. But I've been holding on to that one for a while. And I,
[18053.82s -> 18061.38s]  but that's the point though. Well, who cares? Like I don't, hey, it was, that's how much money it was.
[18061.38s -> 18083.45s]  What do you guys think about that? I don't, who cares? Like I don't want to make it about,
[18083.45s -> 18091.48s]  this is how much it costs guys. So, you know, that was money that I had to spend and excuse me,
[18091.48s -> 18096.73s]  what's going on? Hello. That's why I don't want to talk. I don't like to talk about like what,
[18096.81s -> 18107.10s]  what things cost because I don't want, I don't want to put a burden back to you guys because
[18107.10s -> 18111.66s]  then it's like, Holy shit. Well, that was a lot of money. Should we give him more? No,
[18112.38s -> 18127.59s]  no. The answer is no. Like a full stop. No, absolute no. But if I can put money back into
[18127.59s -> 18136.30s]  the stream because the stream makes money, anybody with a calculator and a computer,
[18137.51s -> 18142.63s]  can, you could take some wild guesses as to how much money this, the stream takes in a month. You
[18142.63s -> 18148.23s]  could. So if I'm capable, I want to put money back into the stream and do fun shit. Why the hell
[18148.23s -> 18176.66s]  wouldn't I? There's no reason in my, for me. It's just, Oh, okay. This I have some, like I've
[18176.66s -> 18185.00s]  revenue from this channel. Do I do a carnival or do I not do a carnival? The answer will always be,
[18185.72s -> 18193.86s]  I will do a carnival, you know, always. So that's just the way it is. And that's the, that's,
[18194.42s -> 18206.68s]  there you go. I talk, I'm, I'm naked in front of you. Hey, Yoda985, thanks to 281,
[18207.32s -> 18221.99s]  you're a persona five villain. And that's also where we get into, not to go any further on this,
[18221.99s -> 18229.80s]  but that's also where it comes down to maybe involve some company or a sponsorship that
[18229.80s -> 18234.52s]  thinks some of that, those ideas are funny and like, lets me kind of do what I want to do
[18235.88s -> 18242.92s]  and like helps out financially. Like maybe I can not have to do that much more money. You know what
[18242.92s -> 18250.73s]  I mean? Maybe like, all right, meet me halfway or something like that to do streams like those.
[18252.60s -> 18262.74s]  That's, we brought up this up a month ago or so, and I don't know, is that possible? Maybe.
[18267.78s -> 18275.11s]  But if I can make a better stream, then I'm going to take the avenue that allows me to do that.
[18275.75s -> 18287.86s]  Or if I try to make a better stream, like try to, because that's all I can do is just try.
[18287.86s -> 18295.93s]  And like, that's it. Was it good? Was it bad? Maybe it wasn't so good, but maybe some of the
[18295.93s -> 18301.16s]  projects you've seen, you're like, that guy, that wasn't that great. Did I learn something from it?
[18301.16s -> 18309.64s]  Can I try again the next time? Maybe, but I don't want to get long winded more than I already am
[18309.64s -> 18323.48s]  about this. Off bugleberry pottery cough. No, no, that was worth it. That's like one of my favorite
[18323.48s -> 18338.12s]  things. I like, I love that segment. It's like, I can't wait to see him back on camera. We're
[18338.12s -> 18345.38s]  going to move on. Do not take anything I said for any reason. I think you need to be concerned
[18345.38s -> 18351.62s]  about my financial life. Yes. Yes. I, I, I pulled from a retirement account to make the German rumble
[18351.62s -> 18355.94s]  video and I would do it a thousand more times because that was some of the most fun I've ever
[18355.94s -> 18360.58s]  had in my entire life. And I will never have that experience again. That's an experience that I will
[18360.58s -> 18365.06s]  never have again. And it was an experience I will never forget. It was absolutely worth doing,
[18365.86s -> 18379.75s]  but that was also, uh, like almost five years ago now. So don't worry, don't worry. I'm doing fine
[18380.31s -> 18393.13s]  until live action rumble two, which will be live and streamed on Twitch. That's the plan.
[18394.14s -> 18400.74s]  I want to do one on Twitch and I want to do one live on Twitch. I have, I've told the whole,
[18400.74s -> 18405.30s]  the whole thing's already written. The whole thing's done. This needs to be set up and
[18405.30s -> 18413.14s]  videotaped. Who has any idea of when that's going to happen? I have no idea. Probably not for a long
[18413.14s -> 18430.34s]  time. Here goes another 40k. No, no, but I don't want to, I just, all right. I, I, that's why I
[18430.34s -> 18438.09s]  don't like talking about like money and shit. I don't want it to be like, eh, whatever. Let's keep
[18438.09s -> 18449.53s]  going. We're almost done. Uh, we have the man with the baby hands. Thanks for 500 bits. Chat has been
[18449.53s -> 18457.48s]  more psychotic than usual tonight. I mean, early in the stream, people were fucking going nuts.
[18458.12s -> 18463.85s]  We're very mean today to me. They were very mean to me. They said he's stupid. He can't even do
[18463.85s -> 18473.93s]  just no rhythm. He's dumb. Then I like turned the webcam on and one of my teeth fell out.
[18474.57s -> 18480.73s]  I was like, what the fuck you guys fucking did? I don't know what, is that, is that possible? Can
[18480.73s -> 18492.34s]  you guys like radio frequency? One of my teeth fall off? It's weird. And then I played the same
[18492.34s -> 18498.98s]  song in their ears, uh, a hundred times. And then people, uh, were like, I'm going to bed,
[18498.98s -> 18507.24s]  which is completely understandable. Thanks to the 500 bits. Hey M. Weldo, thanks for the 250. They
[18507.24s -> 18534.97s]  say it can be done. Uh, what can be done? Oh, what is this? F it up by Lewis Cole and be done.
[18539.56s -> 18559.67s]  Yeah, you can fit them. You can fit people here. But, but here's the only difference is they're not
[18559.67s -> 18565.59s]  in full marching band costume and they don't have, and they're not all playing trumpets and
[18565.59s -> 18576.25s]  tubas. I remember I want a tuba. It can be done though. Yeah. I want to link. Here's a link.
[18576.81s -> 18597.51s]  This is ridiculous though. Anywho, Hey Dell kit. Thanks for the 300 bits.
[18597.51s -> 18601.27s]  Jeremy, first time ever donating. Do you plan on playing Morrowind or even perhaps Daggerfall?
[18603.14s -> 18613.24s]  Um, probably at some point, I feel like you kind of have to. Star and I were talking recently about,
[18613.24s -> 18620.57s]  um, getting SWAT four together, something that we've been trying to do for a long time.
[18620.57s -> 18628.84s]  And it's, it came onto GOG and seemed like a fun idea. And, uh, I was also talking to,
[18628.84s -> 18635.91s]  talking to Italics about it. Maybe get a few people at three, four people maybe and do some SWAT
[18640.54s -> 18645.26s]  recently for the past six years. Well, no, no, recently it came, it came out on GOG like last
[18645.26s -> 18650.79s]  year. Six years ago, we were like, let's play SWAT four, but it's like, oh, you can't, it's kind
[18650.79s -> 18661.91s]  of weird. You can only do it through LAN or you had to buy a server or something. But now on GOG,
[18661.91s -> 18671.78s]  I think you can do a direct connection to each other. I think it was years ago. Well, we'll see.
[18671.78s -> 18677.80s]  But it turned, that was something we were talking about. Cause I know people said Morrowind
[18677.80s -> 18685.03s]  multiplayer do it. That's another thing that'd be fun to do for somebody. I think a lot of people
[18685.03s -> 18692.76s]  say when Joel was playing it or something. And I don't know, it'd be fun. That it should be fun to
[18692.76s -> 18700.50s]  do. Peaceful Haley. Thanks for 250. So I moved in with my grandparents and what do you, what do
[18700.50s -> 18705.86s]  you know? The internet is shit. Download speed is not even one megabit per second and upload is
[18705.86s -> 18722.09s]  like two megabits. Rip my stream. Damn. That's like, it's like next level low. That's like in
[18722.09s -> 18735.02s]  the earth low. That's like, that's in the earth's mantle low. That's insane. Well, hopefully
[18736.44s -> 18744.60s]  we need to get it upgraded or, uh, get to a new spot. Maybe whatever you do. And you can,
[18744.68s -> 18748.12s]  you could maybe, you could squeeze though. You could squeeze some work out of two
[18749.00s -> 18754.70s]  megabits up. It's going to be a little crusty, but it, you, you might be able to make it work.
[18754.70s -> 18766.41s]  It's possible. Ray Joel. Yeah, sure. And I don't know, tell them like, tell them like I shit my
[18766.41s -> 18780.92s]  pants on streaming. It was like insane. Like, dude, it had really, it was fucking crazy.
[18782.04s -> 18786.28s]  Like freaked out and like ran out of the room and like the stream was just on BRB for like fucking
[18786.28s -> 18791.56s]  30 minutes. They came back and he was wicked embarrassed and his face was bright, fucking
[18791.56s -> 18808.09s]  ready at face came on at the time. What the fuck? He left the game on. You're a pathological liar.
[18811.26s -> 18819.45s]  I'm a pathological comedy liar. Come on. No, excuse me. Uh, the proper word is storyteller.
[18820.09s -> 18835.88s]  Thank you. I'm putting that in my Twitter bio. German nine eight five visionary storyteller
[18837.30s -> 18863.59s]  streamer liquidator of retirement accounts. So you're a Virgo. Oh yeah. Well, Ray,
[18863.59s -> 18873.93s]  Joel, you don't have to do that. Say hello when we're done here. Hey Yoda nine eight five. Thanks
[18873.93s -> 18879.05s]  to the two dollars and 81 cents. The year is 2,107. I checked my cybernetic implants and
[18880.17s -> 18885.37s]  see that German is streaming. He's on his death bed and sadly announces that this is his last
[18885.37s -> 18891.85s]  stream ever. He tells us not to be sad as he's lived a full happy life. His heartbeat monitor
[18891.85s -> 18899.70s]  goes flat and chat is filled with F's and germa Pluto's full high school marching band kicks in
[18899.70s -> 18905.51s]  the door and begins filling the room blasting the pirate spy song. President Elbertson dies
[18905.51s -> 18933.96s]  like a true clown beloved. That's sad. Thanks to the two dollars and 81 cents. Hey reant deliriation.
[18933.96s -> 18939.29s]  Thanks for the thousand bits. Germa said, give more money. I'll take it. But I never said that.
[18939.67s -> 18944.07s]  Thanks for the 10 bucks. King sherbert nine 87. Thanks for the three bucks. Shut up and take my
[18944.07s -> 18949.67s]  bits. I'll take them. I'll take them. Thank you. Chunky baloney. Thanks for the 500 bits. Everyone
[18949.67s -> 18955.99s]  hurry and give him bits while we still can. Thanks for the five dollars. Chunky baloney. Unnecessary.
[18955.99s -> 18961.98s]  Don't worry. You don't have to give me money ever. And I know that that's like oh he says that. He's
[18961.98s -> 18967.24s]  saying that and then people are going to do it. Don't feel obligated to give me money. You don't
[18967.24s -> 18978.23s]  have to. Look at how good look at how good I am. I know. I know. Look. Trust me. But you don't have
[18978.23s -> 18992.41s]  to. You really don't. If you do then I'll take it. Thank you. Okay. I won't give you money. Now what?
[18993.13s -> 19001.18s]  Hey evil fish. Thanks to 250. If you had access to a movie production crew, a well-connected
[19001.18s -> 19004.62s]  casting director and a few. I just broke my headphones because I'm sitting there playing
[19004.62s -> 19011.51s]  with them. Same exact thing happened to the last ones. Ah damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. I
[19011.51s -> 19015.83s]  broke the thing in half. It's okay. It's the other. It's the left headphone. I played with
[19015.83s -> 19020.65s]  it too much and I broke the jelly thing. Whoops. If you had access to a movie production crew,
[19020.65s -> 19023.69s]  well-connected casting director and a few million dollars, what sort of movie would you make?
[19023.69s -> 19031.93s]  I would make a Jerma Rumble live action too. Here's a joke that will never make it into a
[19031.93s -> 19040.18s]  Jerma Rumble but um this is the this is this is a two million dollar joke. I want to do it really
[19040.18s -> 19046.41s]  bad but here's a here's a this is this is written down. I wanted one of the contestants to be a
[19046.41s -> 19059.53s]  school bus that just drives into the ring. Oh here comes a school bus and it just drives up and like
[19059.53s -> 19065.90s]  fucking runs the whole ring over and the ring is ruined but they people are still getting
[19065.90s -> 19077.64s]  eliminated and stuff like the ring is collapsed but people are still like having to somehow find
[19077.64s -> 19082.60s]  a way to like throw people over the top rope even though it's on the ground. Two people like two
[19082.60s -> 19088.12s]  people hold up the top rope you know like we're gonna eliminate this guy he's too good one person
[19088.12s -> 19095.21s]  holds one side one person holds the other taut and like just to be able to eliminate him yeah that's
[19095.29s -> 19102.15s]  like a that would be that would be a ton of money that was written down that's one of the things
[19102.15s -> 19112.44s]  it's not gonna happen ever though. You have to throw the bus off the top rope and there'd be
[19112.44s -> 19119.74s]  there'd be somebody driving the bus that's like silhouetted out and they never come out like the
[19119.74s -> 19125.18s]  camera will pan around there's like a guy in there just sitting there like just without like an
[19125.18s -> 19130.42s]  emotionless face he's just sitting there driving the bus. Is he the contestant or is it the bus?
[19130.58s -> 19154.14s]  It's the bus but that guy never comes out. NPC bus driver why are you linking me a monster ebay link?
[19163.90s -> 19180.04s]  But you have to understand a free local pickup look just hurry up and liquidate your retirement
[19180.04s -> 19186.95s]  account I want to do it so bad so you'll know you'll know if I got what I wanted like in quotes
[19186.95s -> 19193.19s]  creatively speaking if a school bus runs the fucking ring over at some point in live rumble
[19193.19s -> 19231.72s]  2 keep an eye out and it would just go on as if it was normal for a while there's like another
[19231.72s -> 19239.75s]  thought of like oh the it's fucking ruined it's destroyed oh I can't I want to tell you this part
[19239.75s -> 19247.96s]  oh but it's it's so fucking funny it's the funniest thing that I've I've I've ever thought of
[19247.96s -> 19258.12s]  and I don't care if wow he thinks he's funny yes this one's funny no this one will happen
[19258.12s -> 19268.66s]  is somebody gonna suplex the bus can you imagine fucking like getting cranes
[19269.38s -> 19278.68s]  it happened like it'd be able to have the bus get suplexed somebody could get brushed I don't
[19283.24s -> 19295.86s]  that's not gonna happen someone could be in serious danger no the bus runs over the ring
[19297.34s -> 19301.26s]  and then in real time while they're still wrestling in the in the ring
[19302.82s -> 19307.70s]  immediately a construction crew is called to build a second ring next to the ring that was
[19307.70s -> 19315.05s]  destroyed and then they move to the next one and somebody accidentally eliminates themselves
[19315.05s -> 19317.69s]  because they've walked over the top rope because they was doing we could all right
[19317.69s -> 19321.77s]  everybody get over to the next one hurry the fuck up get like the referees and like the guy that
[19321.77s -> 19327.82s]  was doing really good at the time like steps over the top rope okay he's out stop spoiling
[19328.54s -> 19336.01s]  this is like 3 000 of these in german rumble life too don't worry giving you I'm giving you
[19336.01s -> 19348.38s]  teasers of hypothetical jokes are these written down the whole thing's written down it's all done
[19348.38s -> 19365.16s]  it's done that was one thing where it was like holy shit that's like not possible but it's kind
[19365.16s -> 19371.24s]  of funny and if I ever had like the the right crew and the lots of fucking money whether it's
[19371.24s -> 19376.76s]  from a sponsorship right or something somebody stuff like that these are all like fun hypotheticals
[19376.76s -> 19380.68s]  to tell you like oh he's spoiling no I mean that's you're talking about that's that's
[19381.64s -> 19385.56s]  probably hundreds of thousands of dollars like let's be real to get something like that to be
[19385.56s -> 19390.68s]  a reality it's just it's a lot and I don't know I did that's why in case it doesn't happen yeah
[19390.68s -> 19403.08s]  I need to tell you you know because it probably won't I have to tell you I've been I've been
[19403.08s -> 19410.28s]  having I've wanted to tell you about the school bus entrance for like two and a half years and
[19410.36s -> 19427.51s]  I did because it's fun who wins why would I tell you who wins anyways let's keep going
[19432.31s -> 19437.03s]  uh but that's what I would do and evil fish that's what I would do if I had
[19437.75s -> 19444.17s]  a well-connected casting director of a million dollars and I could do whatever I wanted the
[19444.17s -> 19453.67s]  school bus joke there you go I have to be honest Wembley TTV thanks for the 250 sad to say you
[19453.67s -> 19458.71s]  fail that that Metal Gear Solid 2 reference after you get asked that a hundred times during the game
[19459.93s -> 19463.77s]  I find it funny during your rants about paying your taxes you remind me of an old WWF wrestler
[19463.77s -> 19476.62s]  Erwin R. Scheister IRS cutting a promo about people not paying them IRS what an interesting
[19476.62s -> 19493.70s]  character okay so this is uh rip Alex Trebek thanks for the five dollars Jeremy I love this

[19537.72s -> 19557.34s]  the school bus thing the school bus driving into the ring no the school bus school bus getting
[19557.34s -> 19568.44s]  suplexed and you just imagine the school bus getting suplexed and it's on its back upside down
[19568.44s -> 19579.66s]  and it's just still trying to drive the wheels are like spinning and then everybody has to like
[19579.66s -> 19588.92s]  get over and like lift it and lift it out of the ring and roll it out of the ring yeah the driver
[19588.92s -> 19595.08s]  is still emotionless there would be a at least two or three close-ups of this dude driving the bus
[19595.88s -> 19599.80s]  while even like in the air being suplexed and he's just like kind of putting his like fingers on
[19599.80s -> 19610.34s]  his nose and like kind of like like blinking and he's not it's not him it's the bus he's just there
[19610.34s -> 19620.97s]  he's just like a crew member he just like has to be in there it has to explode when it gets thrown

[19754.30s -> 19766.94s]  it though I could probably I would probably I would probably just tone it down maybe eventually
[19766.94s -> 19773.70s]  over the years instead of streaming like three four days a week or four days a week or so but
[19773.70s -> 19782.42s]  I would probably just just to kind of be a presence I'd still be around you gotta make the last stream
[19782.42s -> 19799.51s]  a wild one yeah I mean it's not gonna happen anytime soon but it is gonna happen I would
[19799.51s -> 19806.70s]  tone it down first before I really was like all right bye I would stream like I don't know
[19806.70s -> 19810.70s]  once I got to the point where I was like all right this has been really fun but it's time for me to
[19810.70s -> 19817.54s]  step down I don't know I probably stream like once or twice a week I wouldn't just disappear
