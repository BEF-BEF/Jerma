[0.31s -> 18.57s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with Facecam Fortress 2, playing, oh, bang, as the Heavy live stipulation match.
[18.57s -> 25.82s]  Come here. Come here. Damn it. Live stipulation match as the Heavy, as you can see with the killing gloves of boxing.
[25.82s -> 35.38s]  Dr. Pepper? Hmm. I don't know how well this is going to go, but I'm only allowed to use the killing gloves of boxing.
[35.38s -> 45.82s]  Let's see if I can't. Oh, come on. All right. I'm going to bait him. I'm going to bait him. Where'd he go? Come on. I got to bait this guy.
[45.82s -> 52.26s]  You just get in here. Come on. Oh, now there's a mini sentry. Give me some health.
[52.26s -> 60.21s]  Playing on Frontier, which is, I love this map, but no one really ever plays it. I think it's because it's really, really big.
[60.21s -> 68.86s]  Oh, this guy. No, no, no, no, no. I'm going to go up here. Let me eat. No, I don't even need to. There's a health pack. Ha ha.
[68.86s -> 76.28s]  Can I catch somebody off guard right here? Come on. Right here. Right here.
[76.28s -> 85.28s]  Say hello to my little friend. Hello there. No. Oh, come on.
[85.28s -> 95.73s]  Two guys blew themselves up on me. Oh, for the love of crap. You are not a spy. Let's just eat this right here.
[95.73s -> 101.72s]  No, no, no. Got to get another kill. We got to get like two or three more kills.
[101.72s -> 107.72s]  That scout right there is dead. I'm going to walk up the steps and I'm going to. Whoa, what? What is going on?
[107.72s -> 121.72s]  Oh, they're over the guy. Come here. Oh, good job. Good job, scout.
[121.72s -> 129.34s]  Let's get back in this. I've got people to punch in the face. Come on. What do I got?
[129.34s -> 134.34s]  One kill so far or three technically because those guys both blew themselves up. I don't know. I don't know.
[136.60s -> 141.60s]  I got to get like 10 kills. That was a bad number to say because I don't know if I'm going to be able to do that.
[141.60s -> 154.45s]  Here we go. Jump over the edge here. Be a heavy spy. It'll work. This sniper wants me so bad.
[154.45s -> 163.36s]  I'll get the sniper. I'm going to get this guy right here. That counts as one. Hey, sniper. What? Where is he?
[163.36s -> 173.42s]  Did he get killed? Oh, damn it. There's the sniper. There's the sniper. This guy's AFK. Come on, kill him before I. Come here.
[175.43s -> 181.42s]  Oh, no, I can't go down here. This guy's going to just shoot me. Here we go. Come on. Eat the sandwich. Eat it.
[181.42s -> 189.55s]  Eat it, you fat bastard. Sniper's right here. Where are you? Oh, hey, what's up, man?
[190.55s -> 194.88s]  Come on. Come on. Come on. Get up the stairs. Somebody's right here.
[200.41s -> 205.71s]  Where's this guy? Come on. He went down here. No, he's dead. He's dead. He's dead. We're good. We're good.
[205.71s -> 213.79s]  Oh, I'm so scared right now. I'm terrified right now. I'm going to wait for someone to drop down.
[213.79s -> 228.58s]  We'll just get on the cot. Come on. Get it. Get it. Oh, no, I fell off the cot. Oh, I fell off the cot.
[228.58s -> 236.76s]  We're going to win. That's a win right there. Two thumbs up right here. Come on. Good job, guys. Good job.
[236.76s -> 243.99s]  Yeah. I don't even know how many kills that was. What did I say? I wanted to get 10?
[243.99s -> 249.49s]  One, two, three in the beginning. Four or five. All right. I still owe like probably four or five kills.
[249.49s -> 257.27s]  So let's see if we can get them. Come on, boys. Let's do it.
[257.27s -> 266.50s]  Come on. 60 seconds. Time travel. All right. Here we are going to sit here.
[266.50s -> 273.70s]  I'm going to wait for them to come out. I'm going to attack. Not going to move. Don't move.
[273.70s -> 280.44s]  Play this like a spy. Don't don't move. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
[280.44s -> 286.26s]  No, never mind. Hey, spy, get out of my spy spot.
[286.26s -> 292.59s]  Here we go. I am going to catch a son of a bitch around this corner.
[292.59s -> 299.27s]  We go. This is it. Yeah. Oh, crit sniper. Are you serious?
[299.27s -> 305.70s]  This this. I got backstabbed. Oh, I had that.
[305.70s -> 312.46s]  I would have punched that medic right in his mouth face. Oh, I had that, too.
[312.46s -> 318.02s]  I can't believe a crit sniper came out of nowhere. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.
[318.02s -> 326.11s]  Damn it. I'm cool with sitting here. Come on. Push the cart. Push it a little bit.
[326.11s -> 332.94s]  Yeah. Yeah. Here you go. Come on. Come on. Push it. Push the.
[332.94s -> 341.23s]  All right. You know, let's just go in. We're going in for the. Here it is. Oh, yeah.
[341.23s -> 345.97s]  Somebody else. Get somebody else. Somebody walk right through this hallway and just smash.
[345.97s -> 353.94s]  No. Is that. I thought that was a teleporter for a second. What the hell? Heal to full.
[353.94s -> 357.94s]  I'm behind enemy lines right now. I got I got a good a good thing going on right here.
[357.94s -> 365.34s]  Oh, I think that guy saw me. I think that Pyro just saw me. Oh, crap.
[365.34s -> 373.27s]  Come here. Oh, no. Come here.
[373.27s -> 383.49s]  Oh, you son of a bitch. Damn it. I would have had him.
[383.49s -> 391.08s]  I would have had him. Where are we going here? Where are we going here? Come on. Oh, they kept it.
[391.08s -> 396.64s]  All right. Two more lives, two more lives. That's what I'm asking here. Got to get like one or two more kills in the next two lives.
[396.64s -> 406.54s]  Am I going the right way? Yes, I am. This is a good spot to be in. I can sit right up here.
[406.54s -> 412.21s]  I want to string together like three kills in a row. Oh, I'm sorry, engineer. I'm like taking your spot.
[412.21s -> 421.21s]  There's one. No, no. Another sniper. That's what it was a spy.
[421.21s -> 430.53s]  Come on. This guy's no idea. He has no idea. At least I got him.
[430.53s -> 437.24s]  All right. One more death. One more death allowed. How many kills do I have? Ten. I got to my goal.
[437.24s -> 442.24s]  I got to my goal. I got to my goal. I got ten kills. That was my goal.
[442.24s -> 451.69s]  Let's see if I can pad that goal a little bit here. Let's hope so.
[451.69s -> 459.41s]  Last life. Come on. Here it is.
[459.41s -> 464.58s]  Yeah, I knew it. I knew it. What? Oh, it's a pyro. Pyro spy. Hey, what's up, dude?
[464.58s -> 471.71s]  You want to do it again? Come on. Do the stair stab again. Oh, no. There he is.
[471.71s -> 478.42s]  Look at me. I got to chase this guy out. Oh, fantastic. Oh, please don't jump and backstab me.
[478.42s -> 487.23s]  Please don't do it. What the? What? I just got so freaked out right there.
[487.23s -> 493.62s]  There is a spy up here, man. I'm telling you. It's all right. Whatever. He's going to kill you.
[493.62s -> 502.05s]  I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do. I can jump over here, though. Oh, no. Mini century.
[502.05s -> 507.05s]  Yes, there it is. Eleven. Eleven kills. Oh, make that twelve. Make that twelve.
[508.05s -> 515.19s]  Mini century just annihilated me. Oh, and there it is.
[515.19s -> 519.19s]  Well, that's going to do it for this live stipulation match, guys. Thank you so much for watching.
[519.19s -> 525.67s]  I really do appreciate it. And I'll see you guys all next time.
[525.67s -> 531.34s]  And of course, take care, everybody. See you guys soon.
