[0.57s -> 5.53s]  Alright, should we back to normal? You guys can hear me, right?
[5.53s -> 13.72s]  Should be back to normal. Alright, so what uh...
[13.72s -> 17.08s]  Ooh! I know! I know! I know! I know what we can do!
[17.08s -> 23.35s]  The reaction test! Remember last night we talked about the reaction test?
[23.35s -> 27.35s]  I was gonna prove to you guys that I see the world at 1.14 speed.
[27.35s -> 42.12s]  Okay, where is it? Reaction test. So human benchmark?
[42.12s -> 49.35s]  Let's get the camera back on. Wait, is the camera even gonna be able to work?
[49.35s -> 64.33s]  Let me uh... oh no, it's still this like purple shit.
[64.33s -> 70.44s]  You could just see every individual here. That was disgusting.
[70.44s -> 74.50s]  What's the best reaction test? Is that the one?
[74.50s -> 82.25s]  Or is there a better one? Let's change the title to...
[82.25s -> 84.81s]  Well, we'll just hang out. We haven't really... we haven't had a proper
[84.81s -> 90.46s]  just sit around and chill hang out stream in like a month or two.
[90.46s -> 109.48s]  So how about uh 1.14 brain speed? No one's gonna know what the
[109.48s -> 129.24s]  fuck that even means. Do they have to... do they though?
[129.24s -> 137.69s]  All right, so let's get a... let's get the camera back.
[137.69s -> 141.05s]  I'm like ugly right now though. Should I like... should I really be
[141.05s -> 148.42s]  broadcasting myself to IRL? With the pasted on
[148.42s -> 162.04s]  dog hairs that are on my face right now? You know what I'm saying?
[162.04s -> 185.30s]  That looks okay. All right, we look... we look terrible.
[185.30s -> 190.76s]  Let me get that on screen now. This should be just a window, right?
[190.76s -> 199.06s]  What the human benchmark stuff is there? Is there some other cool
[199.14s -> 208.12s]  shit to do? Do a shaving stream? I can't... I don't have like the
[208.12s -> 218.23s]  necessary means to do that. Space bar challenge?
[218.23s -> 227.48s]  All right, so you have to wait for green.
[227.48s -> 236.23s]  So you have to do this five times. Do it over here. I'm not going to
[236.23s -> 244.30s]  shave at my desk. Shave at the desk? No. I'm gonna get in
[244.30s -> 249.74s]  trouble if I do that. Won't I get in trouble? All right,
[249.74s -> 257.42s]  let's do it. I just want to see what it looked like.
[258.06s -> 269.72s]  Let's see. There's like number memory, react verbal memory, visual memory.
[269.72s -> 286.68s]  Okay, let's give it a go. Which one is this?
[286.68s -> 298.23s]  Why do I have so many windows open? Which one is the real one?
[298.23s -> 305.14s]  Can I not? Why do I have an Xbox gaming overlay?
[305.14s -> 315.22s]  What the hell are you talking about? Xbox gaming overlay.
[315.22s -> 340.86s]  Let's try it again. There we go. Okay, finally. Move that and move this.
[340.86s -> 346.74s]  All right, click to start. This is going to see how
[346.74s -> 353.13s]  fast my reactions are. You're gonna get a fucking bird's eye view of the whole
[353.13s -> 357.74s]  thing. What's the blue? Oh, fuck. It's the...
[357.74s -> 385.08s]  Here we go. Ready? So when the box turns green, click as quickly as you can.
[385.08s -> 402.41s]  207. 210. That's not bad, is it? 24... That was faster than the last one. How
[402.41s -> 429.10s]  was that slower? 216. Okay, you're
[429.10s -> 432.70s]  currently in the top 89 percentile for this test.
[432.70s -> 442.15s]  That means I'm better than 89. That means I'm better than 89 percent.
[442.15s -> 449.03s]  Right? That's pretty good. Let's do it again.
[449.03s -> 457.13s]  Let's do it again. I can get a better one. You ready? It means you're 89.
[457.13s -> 460.81s]  Three people have taken the test. No, that's like 50,000 people have taken
[460.81s -> 492.38s]  this test. Under 200. Fuck yeah. Almost under
[492.38s -> 496.63s]  200. Look, I'm as good as if you connected to
[496.63s -> 500.71s]  like a server in Asia, right? That's pretty fast.
[500.71s -> 507.83s]  I'm as fast as a packet of data going from my computer to Asia and back.
[507.83s -> 514.06s]  That's fucking so fast. 50 dollars came in
[514.06s -> 518.74s]  from Visual Warlock. Thanks for the 50 bucks.
[518.74s -> 522.90s]  And you say, sorry you got scammed. I have this on top of the two shirts I
[522.90s -> 526.18s]  bought. Speaking of t-shirts, they're available
[526.18s -> 528.74s]  right now if you do exclamation point shirts.
[528.74s -> 532.18s]  There are two... Well, that's not true. There's one new shirt,
[532.26s -> 538.33s]  and there's a returning shirt. Glueman's back. They're both 20 dollars.
[538.33s -> 542.09s]  If you want one, they're there. And they're going to be there forever.
[542.09s -> 547.78s]  I can do this again. Top 93 percentile. I can get under
[547.78s -> 552.66s]  200. But thank you so much Visual Warlock for the 50
[552.66s -> 557.83s]  fucking dollars. It's a huge amount of money. Thank you. Somebody's like,
[557.83s -> 562.33s]  somebody's having like a party downstairs. Do you hear that?
[562.33s -> 566.60s]  No, that one doesn't count. That one doesn't count. I gotta refresh.
[566.60s -> 570.36s]  There's like a party going on downstairs. What am I missing right now?
[570.36s -> 587.40s]  This is not going to save as my average, right? This is a fucking...
[587.40s -> 591.37s]  There is a rave going on downstairs. I'm almost curious as to go check and
[591.37s -> 596.22s]  see what it is. Okay, here we go. Under 200. I know I
[596.22s -> 599.32s]  can do it. It's a six out of five. What's what's
[599.32s -> 604.52s]  going on? No, don't save this score. Just refresh the page.
[604.52s -> 626.42s]  Ready? What if I caught that? Two... Same exact number.
[626.42s -> 663.35s]  Do it again. I can get under 200. I know I can.
[663.67s -> 673.83s]  The first one was, I was literally the host of the server.
[673.83s -> 682.36s]  Keep it under fucking 200. Got it. 186 milliseconds.
[682.36s -> 687.11s]  Average rate. Let's see, what's that? Currently in the top 92 percentile for
[687.11s -> 696.20s]  the test. Okay, pretty cool. How about number
[696.20s -> 703.50s]  memory test? This one looks cool. So this one is...
[703.50s -> 707.34s]  The average person can remember seven numbers at once. What's the longest
[707.34s -> 710.14s]  number you can memorize? I feel like I had some decent
[710.14s -> 722.52s]  practice with this one. Two. What was the number? The number was
[722.52s -> 737.50s]  two. 72. 72. Honda. Honda. Honda. Honda.
[737.50s -> 747.86s]  406. 1048. You're gonna have to start... Remember, I'm gonna have to start
[747.86s -> 754.60s]  thinking about phone numbers. Fuck off. Not you. No, no. I was
[754.60s -> 761.54s]  pointing at the car. 72. 228.
[761.54s -> 779.19s]  22. 228. 99. 52. 99. 502.
[781.62s -> 785.82s]  968. 5736. 968.
[785.82s -> 790.33s]  5736. 968. 968.
[790.33s -> 798.62s]  9736. 125. 0314. 125.
[798.62s -> 806.74s]  03414. 125. 03414. 125. 03414.
[806.74s -> 811.14s]  492. 8348. 87. 4928.
[811.14s -> 815.78s]  34. 887. 4928. 34887. 4928.
[816.74s -> 844.20s]  4928. 88347. What about verbal memory?
[844.20s -> 848.52s]  Verbal memory test. You'll be shown words one at a time. If you've seen a word
[848.52s -> 851.64s]  during the test, click safe for work. If it's a new
[851.64s -> 855.96s]  word, click not safe for work. Wait, what's the actual thing?
[855.96s -> 861.46s]  You'll be shown words one at a time. If you've seen a word during the
[861.46s -> 867.27s]  test, you've seen it. Amilas. No, that's new. Mango.
[867.27s -> 870.23s]  These are all new. Garments. Mango. Seen it.

[916.36s -> 923.96s]  Seen it. Seen it. Seen it. New. Seen it. Seen it. Seen it.
[923.96s -> 935.19s]  New. Seen that. Seen that one too. Stop. That's new. Seen that one.
[935.19s -> 949.62s]  Top 79%. Top 79%. No, this is not. I'm doing pretty good.
[949.62s -> 964.74s]  Visual memory. You have to change how this one is.
[964.74s -> 968.60s]  I'm being squished. That's all right though. Okay.
[968.60s -> 973.64s]  Memorize the squares. Every level a number of tiles will flash. Memorize
[973.64s -> 976.04s]  them and pick them again after the tiles reset.
[976.04s -> 1079.77s]  Okay. It's getting bigger. I'm gonna do all right on this one.
[1079.77s -> 1087.45s]  Sorry. Let's stop. Top 66%. His IQ is increasing. Somebody stop him.

[1095.61s -> 1102.02s]  game so we can play? Let chat do it. What? How can I let chat do
[1102.02s -> 1121.34s]  that? Do a personality test? We don't. We did those before. Google
[1121.34s -> 1124.54s]  feud. Is that just a family feud that I can play?

[1185.05s -> 1189.66s]  that game. Kahoot? Don't I need to? No. Kahoot
[1189.66s -> 1193.59s]  was a mess. I can't play Kahoot. The last time I

[3776.18s -> 3781.10s]  Lemonade Stand. Lemonade Stand. What is that?
[3781.10s -> 3786.55s]  Lemonade Stand game. Play Lemonade Stand at cool math games.
[3786.55s -> 3798.65s]  How does this work? Your goal is to make as much money as you can in seven
[3798.65s -> 3802.79s]  14 or 21 days by selling lemonade at your Lemonade Stand.
[3802.79s -> 3805.83s]  Buy cups, lemons, sugar, and ice cubes and set your recipe based on the
[3805.83s -> 3808.47s]  weather and conditions. Start with the basic recipe but try to vary the
[3808.47s -> 3811.51s]  recipe and see if you can do better. Lastly set up your price and sell
[3811.51s -> 3813.67s]  your lemonade at the stand. Try changing up the price based on the weather
[3813.67s -> 3815.99s]  because at the end of the game you'll see how much money you made. Write
[3815.99s -> 3823.43s]  it down and play get to see how to beat it.
[3823.43s -> 3831.22s]  Let's do it. Let me just get this in the right spot. It's not going to be in
[3831.22s -> 3833.70s]  the right spot. This is going to be all fucked up.
[3833.70s -> 3852.06s]  I'm gonna get that. Looks good. Yeah I don't want a bunch of like website
[3852.06s -> 3853.66s]  bullshit all over this. You know what I'm saying?
[3853.66s -> 3863.69s]  I want it to look like clean. Okay so far so good.
[3863.69s -> 3882.70s]  Let's make it a little bigger. So this is Lemonade Stand.
[3882.70s -> 3886.46s]  Somebody like wrapped in tin foil spider manning on my walls.
[3886.46s -> 3911.18s]  Can you hear that? Oh what fucking time? What is it?
[3911.18s -> 3915.26s]  Okay that's strange. This is Lemonade. I think is it raining? Is it raining in
[3915.26s -> 3921.74s]  Las Vegas right now? I think it is. That's weird. All right
[3921.74s -> 3923.58s]  so uh you have to deal with the weather
[3923.58s -> 3926.62s]  which plays a big part when customers are deciding whether they want
[3926.62s -> 3930.66s]  to come. Customer satisfaction. As you sell your
[3930.66s -> 3933.38s]  lemonade people will decide how much they like or dislike it.
[3933.38s -> 3943.75s]  Let me get my fucking face out of the way. Sounds easy. Let's go.
[3943.91s -> 3950.30s]  We'll do seven days. Okay you have zero paper cups zero lemon zero zero
[3950.30s -> 3956.63s]  everything zero. I have 20 bucks. It is 80 degrees and it's hazy.
[3956.63s -> 3962.50s]  You have zero okay 25 cups. Let's do 50 cups.
[3962.50s -> 3968.23s]  Let's get some let's get 30 lemons. I don't want it too sweet though.
[3968.23s -> 3972.98s]  No not too sweet. Eight cups of sugar and 100. You don't want to I
[3972.98s -> 3978.58s]  don't want to water it down. Vice lemon flavor without without the
[3978.58s -> 3985.03s]  the sweetness. Okay got 14 bucks.
[3985.11s -> 3989.66s]  Now I'm going to be too watery. Price per cup
[3989.66s -> 3995.40s]  25 cents. Lemons per pitcher. Five lemons per pitcher because we want
[3995.40s -> 4000.84s]  it to be nice and sweet. Two sugars per pitcher. Ice per cup.
[4000.84s -> 4008.49s]  Three. 25 cents a cup. Not enough sugar. No that's too
[4008.49s -> 4014.49s]  sweet. You don't want it to be that sweet.
[4014.49s -> 4026.09s]  All right let's go. This is me. Anybody buying
[4026.09s -> 4030.31s]  cups? It's 80 degrees outside. There we go.
[4030.39s -> 4039.48s]  Did you like it? Oh you really liked it.
[4039.48s -> 4045.45s]  It's like monsters in this planet here. Yuck.
[4045.45s -> 4050.65s]  Yeah go back to Sesame Street buddy. Go get angry at Grover for the spaghetti
[4050.65s -> 4074.81s]  he fucked up. Get out of my game. Yuck yuck.
[4074.81s -> 4079.96s]  Everybody wants their lemonade. It's so sugary and sweet that's not
[4079.96s -> 4087.18s]  why would you want it like that? More ice yuck.
[4087.18s -> 4093.06s]  More ice yuck. This guy keeps going back
[4093.14s -> 4097.22s]  to my stand. If you don't like it don't come back.
[4097.22s -> 4100.54s]  All right what about the monster? What about the Sesame Street monster?
[4100.54s -> 4107.16s]  Liked it. More ice yuck. More ice everyone.
[4107.16s -> 4113.74s]  Ice more ice more ice yuck. More ice yuck.
[4113.74s -> 4120.92s]  Fuck you all. Oh you managed to sell 21 cups to 105 potential customers.
[4120.92s -> 4123.72s]  Considering the weather I'd say this is pitiful.
[4123.72s -> 4129.69s]  With two percent popularity because they didn't put another ice cube in my
[4129.85s -> 4137.21s]  remaining ice has melted. Well all right we're gonna get a bunch
[4137.21s -> 4141.26s]  more ice then. More ice. What do I have for sugar?
[4141.26s -> 4146.50s]  You have four cups of sugar. Let's do more sugar and I will cut
[4146.50s -> 4150.62s]  back on the lemons and let's get some more cups.
[4150.62s -> 4156.46s]  Price per cup 25 cents. Cut back on the lemons. Add
[4156.46s -> 4160.10s]  sugar because that's what people want and add ice.
[4160.10s -> 4179.50s]  Go. More ice. Why do you guys want so much ice?
[4179.50s -> 4183.37s]  Nobody likes that. When you go to like a restaurant and they just
[4183.37s -> 4186.89s]  they give you like four tablespoons of Pepsi
[4186.89s -> 4193.26s]  and then two bricks of ice. Nobody wants that.
[4193.26s -> 4198.65s]  People are more sad. More ice okay. More ice more ice.
[4198.65s -> 4208.36s]  Mmm more ice. That was pitiful. Your remaining ice. Two of your lemons
[4208.36s -> 4217.10s]  have spoiled. Bugs are in the sugar. 77 degrees. All right I'll give you
[4217.10s -> 4224.36s]  fucking sugar. More ice. I need more lemons.
[4224.36s -> 4227.91s]  Okay I'm still up. I'm still up a dollar 13
[4227.91s -> 4239.22s]  since opening the business. Let's do seven to eight cubes per cup.
[4239.22s -> 4251.96s]  I think the the taste is there. The flavor is there.
[4251.96s -> 4261.45s]  Look at all these customers. What's sold out?
[4261.45s -> 4282.60s]  I don't even fucking cups. All right price per. Let's go 30
[4282.60s -> 4286.36s]  30 cents this time. We're gonna do five lemons per pitcher.
[4286.44s -> 4293.56s]  Five sugars per pitcher and eight. No 10 ice cubes per cup. No
[4293.56s -> 4309.53s]  eight ice cubes per cup. It's 53 degrees outside.
[4309.53s -> 4316.90s]  Make it cheap. Cheap. Very cheap. 15 cents.
[4316.90s -> 4331.48s]  I had to get rid of the inventory. 58 degrees.
[4331.48s -> 4335.00s]  So do people even buy lemonade when it's this chilly? Why? How would I make
[4335.00s -> 4347.03s]  them get it? Who's gonna buy it? There's just no
[4347.03s -> 4353.67s]  ice. They put like less ice in it. Okay I got plenty of lemons.
[4353.67s -> 4359.48s]  I'll get some more. More sugar and then just like a little bit of ice.
[4359.48s -> 4370.89s]  Back 25 cents. Let's get like six. Four. Five is fine and like
[4370.89s -> 4385.50s]  four. Like three ice cubes. No two. Sugary. Really sugary and less ice.
[4385.50s -> 4392.58s]  Do more ice. Three? That's cold out.
[4392.58s -> 4398.86s]  Seven sugars. Seven sugar per pitcher. Three ice cubes. Four ice cubes.
[4399.34s -> 4403.18s]  How are we doing on lemons? Lemons are fine. 58 is not cold but it's not
[4403.18s -> 4405.42s]  lemonade hot. It's not it's lemon. It's not
[4405.42s -> 4431.21s]  lemon. Let's go. Is it too expensive? 50 degrees.
[4431.21s -> 4446.92s]  You have no sugar. Do you do you want I need to put more sugar in?
[4446.92s -> 4451.08s]  This is a that's very very decent lemonade. You're telling me I had 10
[4451.08s -> 4462.38s]  sugar. Six lemons. Three ice per cup. 25 cents. That's worth it.
[4462.38s -> 4470.78s]  Four ice. More lemon. Less sugar. Seven lemon. Nine sugar.
[4470.78s -> 4497.54s]  Four ice. It's too expensive. It's too expensive.
[4497.54s -> 4510.15s]  That's the problem. It's not 25 cents is too much. It's gonna be like 18.
[4510.15s -> 4516.18s]  18 cents. Bring these down a little. Five cubes.
[4516.18s -> 4537.37s]  Go. See? That was just too expensive. What's that? I ran out of ice?
[4537.37s -> 4543.19s]  Zero percent customer satisfaction. It said that's pretty good.
[4543.19s -> 4547.51s]  End of season. Total income. Liquidated inventory.
[4547.51s -> 4552.25s]  Net profit. Five dollars and eighteen cents.
[4552.25s -> 4562.76s]  We're in the green. Oh that was it. 14 days. Okay.
[4562.76s -> 4570.42s]  Let's get cups. 30 lemons. 20 cups of sugar.
[4570.42s -> 4576.15s]  A shitload of ice. We'll go on. We've got to make some money here.
[4576.15s -> 4583.90s]  15 cents. Five lemons. Six sugar. What is it? It's 81 degrees out.
[4583.90s -> 4589.19s]  We're gonna go with like seven or eight cubes. Seven cubes.
[4589.19s -> 4611.32s]  15 cents a cup. Sold it out. It's gone. I needed more.
[4611.32s -> 4619.67s]  How do you go from like 90 degrees to 54?
[4619.67s -> 4631.37s]  Keep the lemons I have. We're gonna make it more sugary.
[4631.37s -> 4657.27s]  Bring down the lemons. 18 cents. Bring the cubes down to two. Okay.
[4657.27s -> 4664.95s]  Pretty average. 91 percent customer satisfaction.
[4665.03s -> 4674.38s]  78 degrees and it's raining. So it's still hot though. Bunch of sugar.
[4674.38s -> 4684.34s]  Bunch of ice. More lemons. We did that the worst possible way.
[4684.34s -> 4687.94s]  All right. We're gonna do. So it's hotter. We're gonna do maybe five ice
[4687.94s -> 4692.98s]  cubes. Drop the sugar. Let's put the price
[4692.98s -> 4700.82s]  at 18 because it's hotter. And bring the lemons up. 50 cents.
[4700.82s -> 4707.59s]  50 cents. 50 cents. That's way too much ice.
[4707.59s -> 4734.14s]  For 78 degrees? It's too expensive. Pretty good. 36 to 103.
[4734.14s -> 4738.60s]  High customer satisfaction. Not. Here we go. This is where we're gonna make all
[4738.60s -> 4742.89s]  the money right now. 91 degrees. It's clear and sunny.
[4742.89s -> 4753.14s]  Buy a shitload of 30 lemons. 48 cups of sugar. 500 ice cubes.
[4753.14s -> 4767.91s]  More cups. More lemons. 30 cents. Six lemons per pitcher. Eight.
[4789.14s -> 4798.12s]  Made it all back. All you need is one day. Sold out the whole inventory.
[4798.12s -> 4805.54s]  62 out of 98 customers. 90. We're doing it again. Here we go again. All right.
[4805.54s -> 4810.17s]  This is where we're gonna milk everybody. Completely, completely dry here.
[4810.17s -> 4870.15s]  Here we go. 71 to 86. That's pretty good.
[4870.15s -> 4873.19s]  97 percent satisfaction. 23 percent popularity.
[4873.19s -> 4877.35s]  It's raining today. I have a lot of lemons. I'm not gonna buy. I'm gonna
[4877.35s -> 4881.94s]  buy one small thing of ice. I gotta get rid of these lemons. I
[4881.94s -> 4887.03s]  got plenty of cups. Price per cup because it's raining out. We're gonna go
[4887.03s -> 4891.58s]  drop this down 25. Get rid of these lemons. Eight.
[4891.58s -> 4896.71s]  Seven. Let's go with like maybe maybe like five
[4896.71s -> 4902.17s]  ice cubes. Four ice cubes. Five ice cubes maybe.
[4902.17s -> 4909.02s]  No, I need more ice cubes than that. Let's go with five.
[4909.02s -> 4918.49s]  Eight. Seven. 25 cents. It's hot out. Yeah but it's raining
[4918.49s -> 4921.05s]  though. So you're getting cooled down by the water particles that are
[4921.13s -> 4935.14s]  hitting your head. Don't fuck with the recipe. I'm gonna
[4935.14s -> 4938.57s]  drop the price. I need more lemons though. They're
[4938.57s -> 4944.33s]  gonna spoil. Definitely not 10 ice cubes though.
[4944.33s -> 4958.38s]  Eight. Then I'll buy it. Drop the price. 20 cents. 22 cents.
[4958.38s -> 4968.41s]  Fucking rainy. Sold it out though. Good. 34 bucks.
[4968.41s -> 4973.11s]  Still doing just fine. 71 degrees in rain.
[4973.11s -> 4979.14s]  I got plenty of cups. I need a little bit more sugar.
[4979.14s -> 4984.47s]  I don't think I need any more lemons. Let's bring this shit down
[4984.47s -> 4989.21s]  though. So let's do like seven lemons. Six
[4989.21s -> 4997.80s]  sugar. Six ice cubes. 20 cents. 18 cents.
[4997.80s -> 5016.04s]  Whatever I know. Lemons. That's still pretty good.
[5016.04s -> 5023.45s]  68 degrees in rain. I have plenty of cups.
[5023.45s -> 5028.66s]  I don't think anyone's gonna want to buy any of this shit today.
[5028.66s -> 5041.50s]  Let's do, let's go for it. 68. Keep it at 20 cents. Six lemons
[5041.50s -> 5045.82s]  per pitcher. It's eight sugars. Five ice cubes.
[5045.82s -> 5053.83s]  They're not buying it. They're not buying it. They're not buying it.
[5053.83s -> 5065.59s]  Dry it. Liquidate. Quick. Liquidate. Make it free.
[5065.59s -> 5074.95s]  We need some more hot days. 72 degrees. I still have plenty of lemons.
[5074.95s -> 5093.06s]  Plenty of cups. I need to tweak this. It's still not that nice up to like
[5093.06s -> 5097.82s]  you drink lemonade. Six lemons per pitcher.
[5097.82s -> 5101.75s]  Let's go with, keep it at eight because I have
[5101.75s -> 5108.55s]  no, let me get another thing of sugar so I can do it.
[5108.55s -> 5117.48s]  That's six. 12. 18. That's fine. Let's go 20 cents. See if they buy it.
[5117.48s -> 5135.18s]  What do we got for ice? Increase that price a little. People are paying for it.
[5135.18s -> 5152.22s]  I sold it all out. Lemon sale. 83 degrees. Here we go.
[5152.22s -> 5157.99s]  Change the game category to lemonade stand. I guess I could.
[5157.99s -> 5161.29s]  So it's gonna be, it's overcast 83 degrees.
[5161.29s -> 5175.99s]  It's time to buy. 75 lemons. 48 cups of sugar. 1,000 ice cubes.
[5175.99s -> 5187.82s]  This is the one. 25 cents. 7 lemons. 10 sugars. 8 ice cubes.
[5187.82s -> 5206.38s]  30 cents. 28. 28 cents. Come on now. Come on. All right. All right. We've
[5206.38s -> 5212.66s]  got the late customers here. Good. Good. Beautiful. 83 degrees. A little
[5212.66s -> 5218.73s]  cloudy. Let's get some more of that sugar.
[5218.73s -> 5225.29s]  No. Give me more ice cubes. Don't fuck with the recipe. It's still 83 degrees.
[5225.29s -> 5241.19s]  Keep it at 28 cents. It's all right. That's pretty good.
[5241.19s -> 5245.08s]  It was a little too sugary but it's okay. I made money.
[5245.08s -> 5251.29s]  That's pretty good. I sold 48 customers. Right now
[5251.29s -> 5263.50s]  we gotta slow it down. 360 ice rip. This is fun. It's so easy
[5263.50s -> 5266.70s]  just to play it. All right. 56 degrees. I'm gonna sneeze.
[5266.70s -> 5271.32s]  I'm gonna take the sneeze cam off. I can't. I couldn't.
[5271.32s -> 5274.02s]  My button's not configured to the right thing.
[5274.02s -> 5279.19s]  Let's get some more cups. Let's get some more sugar.
[5279.19s -> 5292.42s]  Way more sugar than that. Let's go with 20 cents.
[5292.42s -> 5301.40s]  8 lemons. 8 sugar. 3. 4 ice. 3 ice per cup.
[5301.40s -> 5322.28s]  7 sugars. 7 lemons. 20 cents. 18 cents. Buy it. It's good.
[5322.28s -> 5331.94s]  That was all right. 60. Keep the same recipe.
[5331.94s -> 5337.66s]  30 lemons. I'm gonna cut the sugar a little.
[5337.66s -> 5345.82s]  Let's go. 4 cubes. No. 5. No. 4 cubes. Cut the sugar just a little bit.
[5345.82s -> 5356.57s]  Add some extra lemon. 20 cents. 18 cents.
[5356.57s -> 5371.29s]  I got a liquid 8. It's the last day. Final day.
[5371.29s -> 5375.93s]  It's time to make money. Watch this one. 87 degrees outside. I got 21 lemons.
[5375.93s -> 5421.38s]  We're gonna do. We're going all in. 20 ice?
[5421.38s -> 5435.22s]  I can do 10 pitchers. 10. 20. 30. That's. Just make it 100% ice.
[5435.22s -> 5441.51s]  No. No. I got. That's a good strategy right here. 45 cents.
[5441.51s -> 5454.06s]  10 lemons. 10. 12 sugars. 10 ice per cup.
[5454.06s -> 5458.22s]  33 cents. 35 cents. 35 cents. 30. I was wrong.
[5458.22s -> 5481.03s]  30 cents. 30 cents. I had to go all in. It was just like at the New York
[5481.03s -> 5484.46s]  Stock Exchange. Sell it. Sell it. No. Sell it for less.
[5484.46s -> 5487.18s]  Sell it for a little less than him. Less than that. Please.
[5487.18s -> 5495.29s]  Somebody please buy it. 20 bucks. Profit. Nice. That's cool.
[5495.29s -> 5500.58s]  New York fucking stock exchange. I just undercut myself. That's the difference.
[5500.58s -> 5532.25s]  20 dollars in a month. Look. All we need. Hold on a second. Wait a minute.
[5532.25s -> 5537.48s]  We just need one person to buy one glass of lemonade
[5537.48s -> 5555.75s]  for like 30 dollars. Um. So let's do like
[5555.75s -> 5560.89s]  5,000 cents. And there are going to be 40 lemons.
[5560.89s -> 5589.16s]  50 sugars. And like 30 ice cubes. Somebody bought it. How did I sell out
[5589.16s -> 5598.41s]  if nobody bought me a thing? Well anyways that was fun. The ice
[5598.41s -> 5604.25s]  melted. Oh. That was cool. Uh. So. Uh. Oh it's under the
[5604.25s -> 5611.66s]  ice. Under the stream voice. No. Uh. But maybe. Depends. I think.
[5611.66s -> 5615.93s]  Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. He's gonna. Here he goes.
[5615.93s -> 5624.42s]  McDonald's manager? What is McDonald's manager? Is it a game?
[5624.42s -> 5634.90s]  It's the McDonald's game? Duh. Now I want McDonald's.
[5634.90s -> 5650.62s]  screaming i'm turning the stream off hold on the mcdonald's game play mcdonald's video game
[5652.57s -> 5661.08s]  uh no i don't want to do this this looks like a diner dash now but we okay here's what i want
[5661.08s -> 5666.78s]  you guys to do ready this is what we're gonna do let me let me let me increase my size here
[5669.11s -> 5674.15s]  so what i want you guys to do is in the discord in the discord i have that channel for
[5674.15s -> 5684.06s]  recommendations let's lay out a plan here the next stream which will be oh it's today saturday
[5685.37s -> 5700.15s]  we will do hmm should i start ace attorney on like monday what do you think am i gonna finish ace
[5700.15s -> 5712.94s]  attorney will i actually do that or maybe i'll start it tomorrow all right here's the plan
[5712.94s -> 5716.46s]  i'm gonna start i'm gonna start ace attorney tomorrow i'm gonna get it on ipad i'm gonna
[5716.46s -> 5725.51s]  plug it in get everything done um also in the meantime go to the discord and there is that
[5725.51s -> 5728.31s]  recommendation channel by the way you're gonna follow the rules there are rules in that
[5728.31s -> 5732.47s]  channel you don't just go over there and just like spam shit if you're is there if there are
[5732.47s -> 5740.01s]  flash games and i mean like online fun interesting like mcdonald's games that we didn't have i've
[5740.01s -> 5745.42s]  never done right i want to do them because it's fun just to kind of hang out and chill
[5746.06s -> 5752.06s]  and just relax and play some fun little games so we'll do that after i probably finish
[5752.06s -> 5756.78s]  ace attorney so we're gonna start ace attorney tomorrow and then i won't be streaming after
[5756.78s -> 5763.26s]  tomorrow i will be taking a break for a day or two so after tomorrow's ace attorney stream
[5764.06s -> 5768.70s]  we will pick back up on wednesday and depending on where i am with ace attorney we'll see how
[5768.70s -> 5778.71s]  it goes i think that's a pretty good plan how many ace attorneys will i play that i mean i
[5778.71s -> 5783.43s]  don't i can't really i don't know there's i don't really have a gauge to tell you that
[5783.43s -> 5786.87s]  right now because if i have fun playing the first one and i actually get through the first
[5786.95s -> 5791.59s]  one i'm like this is great i can't wait to play the next one then we'll just do them in succession
[5791.59s -> 5795.91s]  at least for i mean i'm not going to do ace attorney ace attorney ace attorney ace attorney
[5795.91s -> 5800.47s]  ace we'll break them up so they're not you know awful to do that that many times in a
[5800.47s -> 5808.07s]  row i have never played an ace attorney game i don't know what they are the only thing i
[5808.07s -> 5812.55s]  know is that meme where you point your finger and you scream objection right so i don't know
[5812.55s -> 5818.89s]  and i don't i don't even know what that means that long as hell how long is the first
[5818.89s -> 5836.65s]  one is the first one more than like eight to 12 hours 10 hours 17 hours they're too long to
[5836.65s -> 5849.74s]  beat in a day about 17 hours how long to beat says 17 well whatever i mean well that was the
[5849.74s -> 5857.85s]  that was an incredibly highly requested thing so i'm going to try it if look if after like
[5857.85s -> 5860.57s]  a few hours it's like all right this was fun but i don't know if i'm going to stream it
[5863.02s -> 5865.74s]  who knows i might i might get really into it and we might have a great time
[5866.54s -> 5873.86s]  so look i'm not going to tell you we're going to do a full completion run of all the ace
[5873.86s -> 5879.54s]  attorney games but i've blindly never played them before so might as well start the first
[5879.54s -> 5886.31s]  one on stream and see how it goes your eyes are really popping like out of my head
[5890.62s -> 5903.35s]  what do you mean should i that is it a problem that sounds like a problem very
[5903.35s -> 5910.38s]  bright oh i don't think i did anything with my settings on my camera uh but yeah we'll call
[5910.46s -> 5913.58s]  tonight that's that should be it for tonight because i really wanted just to kind of close
[5913.58s -> 5917.98s]  the book we'll do three we'll go three days in a row so i really want to close the book on the
[5917.98s -> 5923.66s]  dreamcast stuff which is now done Shenmue still exists that's going to have to be dedicated to
[5923.66s -> 5930.52s]  a completely different day seaman and space channel the first one are not going to be
[5930.52s -> 5934.76s]  part of like the dreamcast streams i'll do them completely separately we'll just do them
[5935.72s -> 5940.84s]  on a random day where they get in so and don't think that this is me just spouting off my
[5940.84s -> 5946.28s]  typical bullshit uh i loved space channel so i'm absolutely going to go back we're going to play
[5946.28s -> 5952.68s]  the first one absolutely so uh i will see you guys tomorrow we'll start ace attorney
[5953.48s -> 5960.81s]  jet set radio abandoned and forgotten by big boomer media i'm going to go shave i'm going
[5960.81s -> 5966.04s]  to go get some mcdonald's so literally the literally the one guy that said mcdonald's is
[5966.04s -> 5969.80s]  the end is the reason why the stream's turning off just want to make sure everyone's well aware
[5969.80s -> 5977.56s]  of that uh end of the stream yeah we're going to go tomorrow ace attorney i'll see you guys there
[5977.56s -> 5984.18s]  if you show up you know if you don't then that's fine we'll see you another time i have to go
[5984.18s -> 5993.10s]  get this thing off my face but let's do the uh the bits let's check it from earlier
[5996.09s -> 6000.01s]  a little bit shorter tonight but i kind of had the inkling that i was going to go three
[6000.01s -> 6007.02s]  days in a row anyway so a little bit shorter stream in the middle here and 50 dollars just
[6007.02s -> 6018.70s]  kind of blasted it right now tyler mike just gave 50 bucks 5000 bits 5000 glad to hear you're
[6018.70s -> 6023.10s]  playing the ace attorney trilogy i finished it recently and i really enjoyed it i think you
[6023.10s -> 6026.86s]  will especially like it if you get into doing the voice uh the voice is like you did in
[6026.86s -> 6030.86s]  sorcery also just want to remind you that it's been over two months since your last
[6030.86s -> 6034.62s]  stream with vinnie uh that didn't go too well you guys said you try again so just
[6034.62s -> 6042.49s]  thought it would remind you germa hart and vineheart yeah i mean we it's just kind of
[6042.49s -> 6048.30s]  whenever we kind of both feel like it right i i we didn't put like a set in stone hey let's
[6048.30s -> 6053.53s]  do something else it just kind of happens i still have to do the gamer challenge with joel
[6054.49s -> 6057.69s]  joel and i are going to do a stream at the same time where we do a gamer challenge and
[6057.69s -> 6064.41s]  the first person to complete the challenge uh wins the trophy we're going to get a custom
[6064.41s -> 6068.41s]  made trophy built i'm making this up now but now it has to happen because i just said it on live
[6071.11s -> 6074.95s]  and we're not going to do getting over it because he already has practice in that game
[6075.51s -> 6080.49s]  i played that game a year and a half ago he has the edge there i'm not going to give him the
[6080.49s -> 6085.37s]  house edge we have to have a game that when neither one of us has played both completely
[6085.37s -> 6096.28s]  blind going into it that's a highly skilled game and that this trophy is going to be worth
[6096.92s -> 6105.00s]  2500 is going to be is going to be made of solid gold um that's a lie too but i'm going to say
[6105.00s -> 6111.62s]  that that's not going to happen because i'm not going to do we're not doing that but yeah we'll
[6111.62s -> 6116.98s]  figure that out all in due time but let's go back to the beginning uh no 2500 gold statue
[6116.98s -> 6119.94s]  just want to be sure you know i don't want to put any pressure on and you know people that
[6120.50s -> 6123.54s]  maybe think well holy shit we're going to do 2500 why'd you say that jeremy
[6124.26s -> 6128.90s]  unfriended uh you know hey dork cube thanks for the one dollar i've come to the realization
[6128.90s -> 6133.22s]  last few years that way oh because we streamed yesterday this is all from yesterday
[6134.26s -> 6140.12s]  and that makes sense okay so yeah the last stream was less than 24 hours ago that's right
[6141.16s -> 6147.56s]  so there we caught those earlier thank you though everybody just give them a top banana
[6148.20s -> 6151.40s]  hey sad vega thanks for the one dollar hey germa i come bearing gifts this is

[6244.47s -> 6255.34s]  right now no no i can't save yourself got you go look we can still make it out of here
[6255.98s -> 6270.86s]  it's too late i tried leon it's too it's really weird but i could stop it you can't let this thing

[6392.18s -> 6395.85s]  up or is this something that i'm missing somewhere by the way if you haven't seen
[6395.85s -> 6399.93s]  attack on titan this is god is there's like a there's like a character in this
[6400.57s -> 6405.21s]  in case you just didn't know there's there are like there's an attack on titan character in
[6406.01s -> 6417.62s]  this clip so like if you don't want to know who's even in the show just don't click that uh but
[6417.62s -> 6424.25s]  thank you for the phantom of the opera uh meme video some guy thank you for the 10 bucks too
[6424.25s -> 6426.81s]  snooze and copter thanks for the one dollar i think it's finally time it's time to bring
[6426.81s -> 6432.01s]  the old schedule back that's right no schedule just turn the stream on and surprise us
[6433.18s -> 6437.96s]  it makes everyone happy because nobody expects it really though do what you feel like expect
[6437.96s -> 6443.72s]  except not playing god hand uh do play god hand even if you don't like it feel like it
[6443.72s -> 6449.16s]  i'm gonna get more bits now to fund the god hand stream how much is it 20 bucks oh whatever i'll
[6449.16s -> 6454.76s]  let my subscription finance it now if you're wondering what what are you uh what he's referring
[6454.76s -> 6463.72s]  to so earlier in the stream i had a little heart to heart with chat about how um i had
[6463.72s -> 6468.02s]  shown up you know getting rid of the schedule right but something that i did since moving to
[6468.02s -> 6473.62s]  vegas and i think it's helped a lot i also think what will help a lot uh is not necessarily
[6473.62s -> 6482.23s]  help but the sus command shows a timer and the timer goes to zero and a lot of times
[6482.87s -> 6488.31s]  the stream doesn't start when that timer reaches zero and even though i have oh three-ish p.m
[6488.31s -> 6493.19s]  like no schedule like afternoons i'll let you know kind of the days it's probably time
[6493.19s -> 6498.89s]  to get rid of the countdown timer for sus because if i don't have a schedule and i'm
[6498.89s -> 6505.06s]  starting somewhere in the afternoons between like 2 30 and like 4 30 p.m pacific having a
[6505.06s -> 6515.46s]  timer countdown is just very it's it's it's it's irrelevant so maybe the timer could stay
[6516.34s -> 6519.94s]  but instead of it being maybe instead of a no but then i don't know if it would work
[6519.94s -> 6526.42s]  like that maybe it could be set where it's like you sense a stream starting today between
[6526.42s -> 6533.42s]  like two and four p.m pacific right because i feel like i'm uh burning a lot of people
[6533.42s -> 6536.78s]  when it comes to stuff like that because you know oh hey tomorrow around like three o'clock i'll
[6536.78s -> 6541.10s]  be starting and then you know oh he's starting tomorrow at three the sus command it's like
[6541.10s -> 6545.82s]  counting down to three p.m three zero zero pacific and the stream doesn't start it's like
[6545.82s -> 6550.78s]  well i'm here where is he oh yeah i was eating i'll be you know i'll be there in
[6550.78s -> 6554.30s]  like 20 minutes oh the countdown went to zero you're supposed to lie you know what i mean
[6554.30s -> 6560.78s]  you're supposed to be live right now i think 99 percent of people are joking yeah but even
[6560.78s -> 6567.82s]  still i i personally don't want to continuously have people think there's a stream starting at
[6567.82s -> 6579.86s]  an exact moment and then you kind of just sit in here that one guy got to him no i've gotten
[6579.86s -> 6586.50s]  complaints from a lot of people before about oh i wish he would just go back to the schedule
[6586.50s -> 6591.38s]  because he's just kind of randomly streaming and he's late all the time and i get it i
[6591.46s -> 6598.70s]  trust me i understand uh i i am very sorry that streams just sporadically happen sometimes
[6598.70s -> 6604.01s]  during the afternoons but that was kind of the intention of getting rid of the schedule
[6604.01s -> 6611.62s]  moving to vegas and we're all well aware of this that since moving to vegas there's been
[6612.50s -> 6627.72s]  more and longer streams streams should start around 3 p.m yeah that's that that's a decent
[6627.72s -> 6631.64s]  way to or like give like a it's like a window like stream starting like between like
[6631.64s -> 6638.33s]  three and four p.m pacific right because then at least it's not a countdown that people are
[6638.33s -> 6642.65s]  going to be like oh fuck or have the countdown be somewhere in the middle and have it say
[6642.65s -> 6650.55s]  like starting around this time or just give like the day time zones are a tricky too i
[6650.55s -> 6658.22s]  just i just it's become very clear that i'm not adhering to the sus countdown it's been
[6658.22s -> 6667.45s]  like that for months and your time is valuable because you're here watching my stream so i
[6668.01s -> 6674.97s]  respect your time and i'm i'm kind of i don't want to disrespect it by just kind of haphazardly
[6674.97s -> 6679.29s]  showing up when i feel like it and there's a countdown that just went to zero i hope you
[6679.29s -> 6689.22s]  understand just show up on time but there is no time because i threw the schedule out the
[6689.22s -> 6695.42s]  window you see it used to be you know tuesday thursday friday 7 p.m eastern that's when i
[6695.42s -> 6700.68s]  was i had to be here now it's just i i might stream tomorrow oh well maybe we'll do another
[6700.68s -> 6705.72s]  one on monday or i'll still i'll do that on tuesday there's no set schedule or dates or
[6705.72s -> 6718.15s]  anything anymore and i'm not i don't want to work on a schedule carve the schedule into
[6718.15s -> 6729.58s]  your chest why not because i had a schedule for two just about two years and when i have a
[6729.58s -> 6735.75s]  schedule of three days a week that is the only time that i allow myself to turn on the stream
[6736.84s -> 6742.76s]  because tuesday thursday friday that's it that's when the stream turns on and that's it and i
[6742.76s -> 6749.75s]  take three days off every week four days off every week and it would be i would essentially
[6750.31s -> 6755.11s]  find myself sitting there you know friday afternoon going oh okay what are we doing
[6755.11s -> 6759.85s]  today rather than oh i can let me get this going and i'll do it on saturday just
[6760.33s -> 6764.09s]  i don't have to do it on friday i can get something ready and then do it on saturday
[6764.73s -> 6781.83s]  it's been a lot better have you really tried to be on time yeah all the time but with the
[6781.83s -> 6788.18s]  nature of like what the nature of what we do on this stream it's hard to like be exact
[6789.11s -> 6795.69s]  you know there's weird technical we play like consoles from fucking 25 years ago
[6795.69s -> 6800.62s]  sometimes like i'm playing up to today i'm playing a ported game that the graphics
[6800.62s -> 6805.05s]  don't even work and need like troubleshooting and i gotta figure that out sometimes it takes
[6805.37s -> 6810.25s]  it's not as simple as hey the stream is on because this is what i'm guaranteed is exactly
[6810.25s -> 6824.97s]  what's happening every day but i know a lot of people say i want you to be on a schedule
[6826.28s -> 6835.29s]  but i don't so at the end of the day i have to do what i know is possible for me to have
[6835.29s -> 6855.78s]  the best possible streams that i can and that's just all there is to it so i want to
[6855.86s -> 6862.89s]  begin the process of starting to detach from hard days and hard times
[6866.07s -> 6869.99s]  because i've in two and three plus a year streaming i've not adhered to them
[6871.45s -> 6875.45s]  because that's not the way my brain has ever been able to work or function properly
[6891.35s -> 6903.56s]  streamers afraid of commitment afraid of the nice girl i like no schedule because i like
[6903.64s -> 6913.83s]  chaos no no but no schedule and no hard there's a lot of people to do it and they and they're
[6913.83s -> 6919.32s]  doing just fine i know a lot of people at least a handful of people offhand that don't have any
[6919.32s -> 6938.46s]  schedule or any time frame and they it's it's it's going very well disciplined emotional
[6944.39s -> 6949.03s]  i like uh i just sort of tune into the stream when i'm bored so no schedule suits me really
[6949.03s -> 6952.71s]  well if it means more streams and longer streams then that means i get to watch more
[6954.47s -> 6959.13s]  yeah i mean there's two ways to look at it there's either go back to the schedule and
[6959.13s -> 6965.05s]  actually hard time yourself and stream three days a week or dump the schedule like i have
[6965.85s -> 6972.10s]  and i mean i streamed simpsons hit and run for 12 hours you know why i did that because i
[6972.10s -> 6978.33s]  knew that the next day i probably wasn't going to do anything and that i could take a break
[6978.33s -> 6983.13s]  the day the day later if that was on a thursday and i am scheduled for friday it's
[6983.13s -> 6988.04s]  like oh well like i don't want to stream that long on thursday because it's just a lot of
[6988.04s -> 7001.19s]  moving parts there and it works it does it works better for a lot of people some people the
[7001.19s -> 7011.27s]  schedule makes them it fixes all their issues it lets them be incredibly strict with themselves
[7011.27s -> 7017.61s]  and on time and ready but i'm never fucking ready every day it doesn't matter what it is
[7018.57s -> 7022.57s]  and some stuff that we try to do here takes extra time or takes extra moments
[7023.45s -> 7029.05s]  and i would rather be able to know and go when i can rather than say i have to go at a certain
[7029.05s -> 7046.25s]  time people work in different ways and people can create things in different ways there's no
[7046.25s -> 7051.85s]  real correct answer it's just how well you handle however you're doing things you're doing
[7058.65s -> 7072.84s]  germa you're actually thinking of the best choice for fixing this problem that you blew
[7072.84s -> 7079.93s]  out of proportion in your head just make the sus timer show a time range i don't think i blew
[7079.93s -> 7086.65s]  it out of proportion considering that one of the uh one of the biggest channel memes on this channel
[7086.65s -> 7094.46s]  is how i'm never on time and it's a joke but it's it's there you know there's a reason
[7094.46s -> 7116.63s]  why that joke exists you admitted it was a joke no yeah but i mean like but do i necessarily
[7116.63s -> 7122.31s]  want one of like the number one things people say as a joke on the channel is that i'm not on
[7122.31s -> 7127.91s]  time and i'm late every day i mean it's funny but at the end when you think when you put the
[7127.91s -> 7146.23s]  microscope on it's like well why the fuck is he late every day but i figured i'd bring it
[7146.23s -> 7156.20s]  up talk about it because then uh the more accurate it can be it'll be better for everybody
[7156.20s -> 7173.45s]  so we also call you short and stupid well all right come on let me let's go over this ready
[7174.89s -> 7183.56s]  short stupid and late you know when sometimes when you look over here and you see those things
[7184.12s -> 7190.55s]  all the time it's like okay all right do any anything else that people have to say
[7197.22s -> 7209.16s]  you know what i'm saying but all uh all quips aside i uh i i do i think it's the right call
[7209.80s -> 7217.85s]  so sus ain't going away let's let's move on sus is not going away it's changing to a small
[7217.85s -> 7223.74s]  time frame the day will still be there the time frame will still be there just no countdown
[7224.70s -> 7243.29s]  i've said my piece well let's move on where are we hey divas thanks for the two bucks
[7243.29s -> 7252.33s]  divas uh demonic cucumber thanks for the one dollar i may have told everyone to make this
[7252.33s -> 7261.29s]  joke and not explain it to you earlier on sorry about that what oh it was the hey peter thing
[7261.93s -> 7277.94s]  it was the hay beater well demonic cucumber was a funny joke and you got me it was the beater
[7277.94s -> 7283.35s]  thing hey smelly boy thanks for the one dollar i'm hearing some nasty rumors about shido can
[7283.35s -> 7290.34s]  we hear him please jeremy i'm sure nothing bad has happened shido went on vacation to the
[7290.34s -> 7302.98s]  downstairs living room he's enjoying himself he'll be back soon he's not dead he's very
[7302.98s -> 7310.02s]  much alive hey demonic cucumber thanks for the one dollar hey hey chew chew i don't like your
[7310.02s -> 7322.36s]  girlfriend hey binary man thanks for the five dollars it's a youtube link is this what is
[7322.36s -> 7350.55s]  this what is this saying what the hell was that was that me talking uh thank you binary
[7350.55s -> 7356.12s]  man for the five dollars i appreciate it thank you fuzzy muffins for the 10 bucks small cheer
[7356.12s -> 7376.02s]  to supplement doctor income thank you though please some love for the eu the move hurt us
[7376.02s -> 7385.10s]  badly and the schedule really helped us i i hate to say this but that's that statement
[7385.10s -> 7394.87s]  is incorrect the streams have pulled back at least one full hour since i moved to vegas
[7397.18s -> 7401.66s]  i don't know where you're getting that statement from i used to start streaming
[7401.66s -> 7410.60s]  at seven or eight p.m eastern every time i start at like six p.m eastern i don't i don't
[7410.60s -> 7421.50s]  know what you mean what does it mean i've pulled the i pulled the stream back an hour
[7430.34s -> 7437.67s]  like telling me that i'm used to start earlier is just that's not true i started
[7437.67s -> 7442.87s]  like three p.m i used to start at seven p.m at least seven to eight p.m eastern every time
[7459.16s -> 7465.50s]  it's hard it's hard to respond to somebody asking a question like that you know what i
[7465.50s -> 7478.12s]  mean it's hard because i i've it's we've gone back a full hour and i've already talked about
[7478.12s -> 7482.84s]  how i'm i can't i'm not going to start a stream at like 10 a.m it's just not going to
[7482.84s -> 7503.67s]  happen i live in a certain time zone that's very very far away from a significant portion of
[7503.67s -> 7515.27s]  european people that that's just that's just the way it is i i can't like turn my stream
[7515.27s -> 7520.54s]  on at like nine or ten a.m i can't i'm not going to do that it's not going to happen
[7531.37s -> 7541.94s]  just move here but i'm i'm sorry if you can't watch the streams live or if they go
[7541.94s -> 7553.54s]  too late but i already because remember i'm starting the stream in the middle of the afternoon
[7553.54s -> 7558.74s]  which is something that i never did before because i moved across the country america's
[7558.74s -> 7565.03s]  huge there's there are four time zones in the united states and i went across all of them
[7565.03s -> 7583.83s]  to the last one britain is more important than vegas well i've told you like the data
[7584.47s -> 7590.94s]  on my analytics i think almost i think 80 something percent of every viewer is from
[7590.94s -> 7600.57s]  north america so think about if i were to start a stream at like 8 a.m a more than a
[7600.57s -> 7624.63s]  majority of every viewer would probably not be here 20 percent of me does not reside in
[7624.63s -> 7645.75s]  north america it can't be late if you never turn on the stream it's the same boomer antics
[7645.75s -> 7656.49s]  as always but it's i to put a cap on this and to move on from it there's nothing i can do
[7658.23s -> 7662.79s]  it's like if if if there's a show that is airing right just think of it like television
[7664.15s -> 7667.99s]  if they like let's say game of thrones for instance is airs at like nine p.m
[7669.88s -> 7677.94s]  it airs nine p.m eastern time like game of thrones the show producers don't sit in a room
[7677.94s -> 7680.74s]  and go no no we got to pull we got to air it at like edit like 11 a.m
[7682.25s -> 7688.41s]  no because it's it's like it's a video it's it's not live a live like the reference like nfl
[7688.41s -> 7695.38s]  right if there was a football game that played at 7 p.m eastern time they're not going to
[7695.38s -> 7701.21s]  like pull the super ball back eight hours because they want to make sure that people
[7702.52s -> 7709.94s]  nine time zones forward you know what i'm saying it's a it's a hard that's very
[7709.94s -> 7727.42s]  difficult thing to balance stop comparing your stream to the super ball no i'm just talking about
[7727.42s -> 7735.59s]  like live all right here's a shittier example um i don't know this is not a that's the wrong word
[7736.31s -> 7739.35s]  and that's not this is not even right like the jimmy fallon show that's a that's pre
[7739.35s -> 7749.02s]  it's pre-taped and they pretend it's live later on are you trying to please everyone
[7749.02s -> 7754.04s]  no i'm trying to tell the people that are not pleased by the schedule that it's not
[7754.04s -> 7762.20s]  going to change because there are it's not just one guy i get a lot of feedback about how late
[7762.20s -> 7769.78s]  these streams start for eu so i'm i'm replying to that and saying that it's just it's not
[7769.78s -> 7791.13s]  going to change anyways let's go uh thank you to keldos for the one dollar it's a perfect

[7833.00s -> 7839.21s]  overdrive since you played jet set i know it's never comparable um probably not not at the

[7868.30s -> 7871.74s]  jamona cucumber for the one dollar you had a big rant about it yesterday so i thought i'd tell

[7972.71s -> 7985.06s]  such a great medium yeah i would agree katamari is sort of otherworldly in its own genre so you
[7985.06s -> 7990.63s]  could kind of say that about space channel although there was i wouldn't call it genre
[7990.63s -> 7998.38s]  defining but it was on the dreamcast so i might have to but i do agree it was a great work

[8909.78s -> 8914.18s]  play the revengeance dlc after it which by the way that dlc is better than the base game
[8914.18s -> 8921.16s]  that's what i've heard uh but about the doctor phil does not have a twitch account
[8921.16s -> 8932.50s]  i can guarantee you that no way but grill master on the other hand he's he's just a bastard that's
[8932.50s -> 8936.90s]  all that needs to be said hey metal waluigi thanks for the one dollar hey germa i've been
[8936.90s -> 8940.02s]  watching your stuff for about five years i want to thank you for all the hours of joy you
[8940.02s -> 8951.48s]  brought me you're welcome thank you for the years of support it means a lot thank you so
[8951.48s -> 8955.77s]  much right to miss thanks for five dollars thanks for staying true to yourself and your
[8955.77s -> 8967.98s]  fans here's to the great times ahead yeah i look anytime i talk about changes or things that i want
[8967.98s -> 8978.86s]  to try things that i want to do things that i want to say i i have to do them i i'm not gonna
[8980.30s -> 8992.57s]  just i'm not gonna do something because i think that i have to right because once you start
[8992.57s -> 8997.45s]  doing that i feel like that's when you go through like the you're going down the path of
[8998.33s -> 9003.02s]  i have to do this i have to do this i have to do this no but i that that that can wait i have to
[9003.02s -> 9007.58s]  have to do this this has to happen this exact specific way once you start to do that you start
[9007.58s -> 9015.27s]  to kind of lose in my opinion at least in like a creative sense you lose what you started
[9015.27s -> 9026.90s]  it for in the first place wanting to do something and having having to do something
[9027.54s -> 9043.85s]  they're very very different and i never want these streams or me anything that i do online
[9044.49s -> 9049.93s]  to start to bleed into the have to category because i've seen a lot of creators over the years
[9050.49s -> 9057.54s]  start to get into the have to categories and that's the place i don't want to be
[9067.62s -> 9076.49s]  and even if it is in a detriment to my business i don't i that's the way it is
[9086.47s -> 9099.30s]  jimmer who is your crush her name is kim let me see come on come on yeah come on they give
[9099.30s -> 9107.66s]  me the points those were points i deserve them i deserve those points and i'll take them and i will
[9107.66s -> 9115.74s]  stand at the back of the court and i will throw a shot put the basketball swish but thank you
[9116.38s -> 9124.63s]  all of you that yes i do things that a lot of other people don't do i'm all over the place
[9124.63s -> 9131.77s]  i'm scatterbrained some of the streams are all fucked up but that's the way that it is
[9133.45s -> 9138.49s]  i i'm not i'm not gonna be able to change some of the deep rooted personality traits that
[9138.49s -> 9151.70s]  i have and i don't want to don't let the jokes get to you no no no no no no i'm not talking
[9151.70s -> 9157.59s]  about jokes i'm talking about actual real concerns that people have and that i have too
[9159.11s -> 9163.11s]  you know you don't just to harp back on you don't think i think about all the time
[9164.76s -> 9168.04s]  like you know see me look at the clock like oh fuck it's like it's it's it's 11 o'clock
[9168.04s -> 9173.42s]  at night right now it's like this late for like it's like fucking 5 a.m for 6 a.m for
[9173.42s -> 9180.31s]  some people you don't think i think about oh what that that stream i want to do this stream is
[9180.31s -> 9185.27s]  that gonna be funny people gonna think that's cool and then oh they did all right awesome all
[9185.27s -> 9188.71s]  right that was worth it oh how people can react to that i think about all the time
[9190.23s -> 9194.23s]  i want everyone to enjoy as much as they can and i want the stream to be as fun as possible
[9199.06s -> 9206.50s]  it's upstairs all the time this guy is well you're very self i'm not i'm not self-conscious
[9208.06s -> 9212.46s]  self-conscious is not the word i've like shown you guys might like boogers on stream
[9213.34s -> 9220.68s]  i was like naked on stream one time i don't give a shit about any of that i just haven't concerned
[9220.68s -> 9228.18s]  with because the channel has grown so much that i want to make sure that we can stay true to
[9228.18s -> 9232.74s]  what we're doing here i can stay true to why i started i can have the same fun that i had
[9232.74s -> 9251.29s]  two three four or five years ago i don't somebody just mentioned i don't know if it's
[9252.49s -> 9260.86s]  self-conscious thing as much as it's a like a like somebody said personal integrity for me
[9260.86s -> 9268.55s]  like jet for like for me i'm not standing on a soapbox and telling you guys that i'm
[9268.55s -> 9273.67s]  let me tell you this about me and why i'm so much better it just internally if i don't do that
[9275.05s -> 9276.89s]  then i lose why i did it in the first place
[9291.64s -> 9298.60s]  maybe you should stand on the soapbox it'll help us find you that was that was almost me
[9298.60s -> 9306.41s]  uttering the words forever ban i'm not gonna do it though all right we're at the end of the
