[3.00s -> 21.58s]  How you doing? What's up? What's up? How you doing? Doing great. Good. Hold on. I got a cough.
[28.66s -> 41.05s]  Okay. Yeah, we're gonna play trombone champ. Start from there. This game is apparently an hour or
[41.05s -> 54.02s]  two, right? Did you get sloppy? What? Because I had to cough? No, no, no, I don't turn 37. And
[54.02s -> 60.20s]  everybody starts calling me sloppy. That's not how this No, no, no, no, I am. I am built like a
[60.20s -> 65.78s]  fucking some kind of animal, whatever it is. I told I said in pre stream, this was not going
[65.78s -> 73.18s]  to be a crack stream. And I'm going to stand by it. I don't know something in the air today or
[73.18s -> 82.50s]  yesterday. I don't know. I'm just like I'm in a weird mood. I have this constant urge to just say
[82.50s -> 86.98s]  just this weird shit. I don't know why I just say it's like fun to me today and yesterday.
[87.62s -> 98.31s]  It's because it's a blood moon. Is it? It's co2 poisoning. It's not. You know why I know it's not.
[98.95s -> 108.66s]  I know it's not co2 poisoning. Because I have a co2 monitor in my place. I know exactly how much
[108.66s -> 116.47s]  carbon dioxide is in the air at any given moment. So I know I know the exact parts per million
[117.27s -> 129.85s]  of co2 in this place. Would you like to know what it is? I can tell you right now. Yeah, why do you
[129.85s -> 138.73s]  guys think I got the water quality test strips? I mean, I pissed on one for a joke. But yeah,
[138.73s -> 148.63s]  the co2 in the air inside of my place ranges from 480 to like 600 or 700 at night with the
[148.63s -> 154.92s]  you know with the window closed. You want as long as that number is under 800 or 900.
[157.18s -> 168.81s]  The typical indoor environment for co2 is four to 800 or 700. It's too much. No, not degrees.
[174.46s -> 182.82s]  This motherfucker opens his windows at night. Yes. Did you know? And okay. All right. Yeah,
[182.82s -> 189.61s]  let me out. Yeah, I watched the Tom Scott video where he talks about co2 and I freaked out and
[189.61s -> 207.34s]  bought a co2 monitor. That's what happened. Like everybody else. People whooing Tom Scott. What are
[207.34s -> 217.22s]  you crazy? That's not that's not happen. That's not possible. Right? Yeah. So in the Tom Scott
[217.22s -> 225.93s]  video, Tom Scott was essentially showcasing another youtuber who trapped himself in a air
[225.93s -> 234.33s]  tight chamber and monitored the co2 and monitored how he felt once it hit certain parts. It's very
[234.33s -> 243.67s]  interesting stuff. If you have a moment to check it out, I would. So I saw the video, I freaked out
[245.11s -> 250.63s]  and I bought a co2 monitor. And ever since, I've been keeping an eye on it. And I open,
[250.63s -> 257.80s]  you know, open up the windows, get some airflow. That's how you reduce co2. Which is actually kind
[257.80s -> 264.76s]  of hard in Vegas because it gets really, really hot and really, really cold. You're paranoid. No,
[264.76s -> 273.42s]  I'm not. What? Just simply monitoring the co2. It is what? That's supposed to be paranoid.
[274.22s -> 283.11s]  Yeah, it's a gas. It's a co2 gas. You think I'm not going to be concerned about it a little?
[289.10s -> 296.68s]  No, you'd be aware of kind of what your surroundings, you know, be aware. But no,
[296.68s -> 303.86s]  honestly, the Tom Scott video is actually really interesting. I, Tom Scott's videos are so cool
[304.50s -> 309.46s]  because it's not just typical stuff. It's just like this water behind me is electrified. If you
[309.46s -> 315.22s]  touch it, you will die. And I'm like, what, where is this? Why is this water electrified? Who did
[315.22s -> 321.14s]  this? And then he goes into this whole thing and it's like, and the videos are not like, they're
[321.14s -> 327.69s]  short. And it's true. If you did, if you touch that water, you're going to get electrocuted.
[328.57s -> 345.88s]  It's not bullshit. I do. I watched Tom's videos. The average human emits over two tons of co2 a
[345.88s -> 352.66s]  week. Is that real? Well, the reason why you want to monitor your co2 in your bedroom or whatever,
[354.26s -> 359.94s]  is because at night you're exhaling in the same room, sometimes with the door closed,
[361.48s -> 369.45s]  and you are just dumping co2 into your room just for eight, seven, six, seven, eight, nine plus
[369.45s -> 376.76s]  hours a night. And if you don't have ventilation and the door is closed, you want to get some nice
[376.76s -> 379.88s]  fresh air in there sometimes. Even if you don't have to sleep with the window open. But you know,
[381.48s -> 389.27s]  if weather permits, crack the window for a little bit. That'd be all day. Crack the window for a
[389.27s -> 401.67s]  little bit, just for a little bit, especially during these months where you can. What if it's
[401.67s -> 408.71s]  too noisy? Also, another thing is airflow. So look, I watched Tom Scott. Okay, I'm going to
[408.71s -> 429.08s]  give you some education here. I'm a Tom Scott watcher. Let's go. Teacher. But no, if you have
[429.08s -> 437.61s]  the door open to your bedroom, at least the air can kind of move in and out. Yeah, I just look,
[437.61s -> 444.17s]  you know, okay, I don't want to like do some fear dropping here. You're if your co2 levels
[444.17s -> 449.13s]  in your house, you're not going to you're going to be okay. All right. I think it's over what's the
[449.13s -> 458.70s]  over 1000 over 1200 parts per million is considered like really stale and not good. So most typical
[458.70s -> 464.46s]  houses sit between a very average, very fine level. Just open your windows every now and again,
[464.46s -> 469.90s]  just get some fresh air in. Oh, that kind of reminds me of a story. Actually, it's a tweet
[469.90s -> 478.20s]  that I never tweeted out. So one time when me and Holly first started dating, I, I had what did I
[478.20s -> 488.15s]  tell us already? Did I already tell this? It's about me opening the door for a reason. Okay,
[488.15s -> 494.31s]  well, I'll tell it anyways. Okay, so when me and Holly started first dating, I obviously didn't
[494.31s -> 506.62s]  want to like fart near her. So what I did is I she was in another room. And I went to the front door
[507.96s -> 512.04s]  and I opened the front door and put my ass out the front door and went like,
[512.84s -> 519.64s]  and like farted. And maybe a full half second after I farted, Augusta wind blew from my back
[519.64s -> 526.01s]  back into the house. And I freaked out. I was like, No, not the whole reason why I did this.
[534.07s -> 540.55s]  Sure. Well, no, nobody. Okay, I don't care what anybody says. Nobody in the first three to six
[540.55s -> 547.34s]  months of their relationship goes to the bathroom. Do you know what I mean by that?
[548.38s -> 553.18s]  Like in the first three months of a new relationship, nobody goes to the bathroom.
[553.18s -> 561.05s]  Nobody has to take a shit. It doesn't work that way. I like, oh, yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, come over.
[561.05s -> 564.97s]  Yeah. Okay. Hold on. But like, before you come over, though, I've got to like work on the car
[564.97s -> 567.77s]  in the garage. It's like, I need like, I'm going to spend like 40 minutes going to the bathroom to
[567.77s -> 576.04s]  make sure I don't have to like farting in front of a new girlfriend or new boyfriend. That's not
[576.04s -> 583.14s]  going to happen. I'm sorry. If I have to take a shit and like my new partner is over, my new
[583.14s -> 591.43s]  girlfriend is over, whatever. I have to go work on the car. And oh, hey, by the way. Oh, by the way,
[591.43s -> 594.63s]  like downstairs, I had this an electrical problem. Don't come down here for an hour.
[599.46s -> 602.82s]  Don't you can't come. Don't come. Don't come into this room for like an hour. There's an
[602.82s -> 614.44s]  electrical problem. Just like, freak him out. I don't do that. I'm fucking kidding. This is a joke.
[617.85s -> 627.16s]  There's CO2 in that room. Don't go in that room. Imagine being a neighbor walking by and your
[627.16s -> 639.93s]  neighbor opens his door and rips ass out the door. Or imagine being on like a security cam,
[640.49s -> 647.42s]  like somebody else's security cam. Like imagine like, oh, what happened on the security cam today?
[647.42s -> 666.02s]  It's like, wait, what's going on? Ring doorbell. Oh, my God. But anyways,
[667.38s -> 675.72s]  yeah, I don't like to just like rip ass in front of a new girlfriend. I don't think anybody does
[675.72s -> 682.94s]  that. Why would you have to give me the benefit of the doubt here? Most people don't really do
[682.94s -> 688.14s]  that immediately. It's not like, oh, hey, yeah, come on in. Oh, yeah, this is my place. Oh, yeah,
[688.14s -> 694.54s]  let me give you a quick little tour. Sorry fart. It was loud. Oh, be careful. Oh, come on over here.
[694.54s -> 698.46s]  It's like, what the fuck, man? What are you talking about? That's not going to happen.
[699.43s -> 709.99s]  I don't think any of you will do that. Who is going to do that? I don't know what I don't know.
[710.55s -> 715.27s]  Jupiter is in some kind of blood moon right now. I'm sorry. The last two days have been weird. I've
[715.27s -> 732.55s]  been very, very like overly energetic and shit. What's going on? Dude, just fart like everybody
[732.55s -> 743.38s]  else. You just turned 37. Yeah. And I'm trying to tell you how I'm a considerate person.
[745.14s -> 755.19s]  I don't want to invite somebody over and fart on them. What? How did you draw this this quickly?
[755.83s -> 772.12s]  You've been talking about arts for 10 minutes straight. Yeah. OK. If you want to play the
[772.12s -> 778.60s]  you're 37 while you're talking about arts card. OK. I want you to open up every every television
[778.60s -> 785.56s]  show in the last two decades and I want you to find me that the only time that there's no like
[785.56s -> 793.88s]  art jokes in that show in the last like 20 years and those shows are written by like 40 year olds
[793.88s -> 804.01s]  plus 50 year olds. Simpsons. Simpsons had a ton of fart jokes. We talked about Breaking Bad had a
[804.01s -> 809.37s]  huge fart joke. Remember when when when Walter put his legs behind his head and took a lighter and
[809.45s -> 825.24s]  farted into it and he did a flame. That happened. I just spilt shit all over me because I'm trying
[825.24s -> 838.33s]  not to laugh at that. I'm sorry. The reaction. All right. God damn it. Hold on. In Game of Thrones.
[838.33s -> 849.11s]  Yeah. You don't remember in Game of Thrones when when Grand Maester Pycelle did the lighter fart
[849.11s -> 856.87s]  flame joke. All these old bones are hard to move but he puts his legs behind his head.
[864.65s -> 870.71s]  Let me ask you a really quick question though. If. OK. Be very honest and I want to poll for this.
[871.83s -> 878.89s]  If Grand Maester Pycelle did that in the final episode of Game of Thrones season eight you would
[878.89s -> 888.65s]  have a better you would have a better view of that whole show. I guarantee it. People wouldn't care
[888.65s -> 892.17s]  that it ended terribly and like the last season was terrible. It was like holy shit we got like
[892.17s -> 897.45s]  the Grand Maester Pycelle dumb and dumber Jim Carrey fart scene. I don't care anymore that the
[897.45s -> 911.74s]  show was terrible. I get we had that now or he doesn't he doesn't have to like kill a skeleton.
[920.12s -> 974.04s]  All right. I got to clean. I spilt shit all over me. Hold on. Have I been sitting here for 20
[974.04s -> 986.87s]  minutes doing this. What the fuck man. It's been seven. It's been for 17 minutes. I need like a
[986.87s -> 996.26s]  producer in my ear. Just being like hey dude it's time to move on. Hey hey move on to something
[996.26s -> 1009.56s]  else. I think I would probably ignore the producer. I probably would. You guys you guys would honestly
[1009.56s -> 1015.46s]  think I was even more unhinged because I would be referencing the producer without even telling
[1015.46s -> 1019.38s]  you that I was talking to anybody else. If I was sitting there talking about like farting out the
[1019.38s -> 1023.86s]  front door and in my ear was hey dude no no no no move on. I'd be like I'm not going to move on.
[1023.86s -> 1030.95s]  Don't tell me to move on. And you guys be like who the fuck is that. All right we're going to play
[1030.95s -> 1045.94s]  uh trombone champion. Trombone champion. Uh it's a game requested to play. Looks like it's really fun
[1045.94s -> 1051.05s]  and interesting. I don't know. I don't really know much about it. What I do know is other
[1051.05s -> 1068.38s]  streamers played it. So my turn. Is it. So I know. It's fun. Well let's go. All right so how does it
[1068.38s -> 1088.30s]  work. It's funny. Northern Lion played it. Fucking love that guy. All right let's go. Are you sure
[1088.30s -> 1109.32s]  you want to start a new game in slot one. Yes. And so it comes to pass. Ages after the twin vessels
[1109.32s -> 1120.14s]  were forged a new soul appears. Brave soul. One day you will stand before two baboons.
[1120.70s -> 1134.92s]  One day you will rent the very fabric that binds this land. But until that day comes
[1136.04s -> 1148.57s]  you must toot. Toot your trombone brave soul. And you may yet become the trombone champ. Cool.
[1150.25s -> 1157.11s]  George Washington. Was that like Thomas Jefferson. Who was that.
[1157.99s -> 1166.22s]  All right. Welcome to trombone champ. Choose play to play the main game.
[1166.22s -> 1177.11s]  Many secrets await. All right. Try. Do settings or anything. Uh mouse speed. I think that's fine.
[1178.07s -> 1185.91s]  Annoyances. Funny jump scares. What should I do with this. Turn up the baboon quality. No.
[1185.91s -> 1190.94s]  We're not. I'm doing normal. I'm not going right into this. Let me just play it first.
[1191.66s -> 1195.34s]  I'm just going to play it. I'm not going to. Oh turn on this like funny mode. Why would I turn on
[1195.42s -> 1207.14s]  like DK whatever it is. The big head 007 mode right now. Okay. Choose your tromboner.
[1207.78s -> 1224.78s]  Okay. Boomer. Yeah. I mean you guys remember 007. Goldeneye had the cheats where you could
[1224.78s -> 1229.48s]  what you can make people's big head. I'm not doing that immediately. You play the game first.
[1230.78s -> 1234.98s]  All right. Let's go. Trombone. There's other instruments. All right. I don't even care.
[1234.98s -> 1237.70s]  I'm going to 100% this right now. Are there licensed songs in this.
[1238.66s -> 1254.66s]  Move the mouse forward and back to move the slide. Line up the dot with the note lines.
[1254.66s -> 1271.35s]  So you go this way to go. Press left. What's this better mouse or keyboard mouse. Press left mouse
[1271.35s -> 1277.66s]  to button or any letter to toot. Play well. You build combos. All right. Let me just let me see
[1277.66s -> 1283.61s]  how it works. Watch the breath meter. If you hold a note for too long you'll run out of breath.
[1283.61s -> 1307.37s]  Okay. Have fun. Okay. Enjoy the beautiful succulent. It's supposed to be inverted.
[1313.61s -> 1343.02s]  It's inverted. Can I change that? It's inverted. I got to change the inverted thing. I feel like
[1343.02s -> 1353.00s]  there's a like this kid in the in the in the house really practicing for their like band practice
[1353.00s -> 1379.14s]  tomorrow. Okay. This is fun. Oh what. Okay. All right. I get it. That's funny. It's fun. I actually
[1379.14s -> 1384.63s]  think this is cool. All right. Let me. I don't want it to be inverted. I feel like I'm like
[1384.63s -> 1402.70s]  flying a plane or something. Not inverted. Is that cheating? Is it cheating? I just want to
[1402.70s -> 1411.45s]  make sure it's not cheating. All right. This is. Oh this is. There are between two and four spiders
[1411.45s -> 1432.87s]  living inside the average trombone. That's not real. Do characters. Characters. What? This is
[1432.87s -> 1441.18s]  the New Year's Eve party and little Timmy's been practicing for everybody. If I see one person
[1441.18s -> 1453.02s]  smirk you're fucking kicked out of the party. I will throw you out myself. See right now. I'm
[1453.02s -> 1464.63s]  not even enjoying the music. I'm looking around like this. Seeing who's laughing at my son.
[1521.37s -> 1540.97s]  All right. That's it. How long is this old thing? You were laughing at your own son.
[1541.53s -> 1553.02s]  Oh I wasn't. I wasn't laughing at my own son. I was merely enjoying the song. All right.
[1555.18s -> 1565.19s]  Uh dudes. This is trombone. Holy wow. Oh Canada. Why don't we. How many songs are there?
[1568.58s -> 1572.28s]  This one's really hard apparently. Wait. We need to do Oh Canada because this is like.
[1573.61s -> 1602.95s]  This is not hard. Wait. Go back. Character two. What? Cool. All right. Let's do uh. That one's
[1602.95s -> 1613.03s]  apparently. That's pretty hard. Let's do Oh Canada. The first trombone was invented in 20 million BC.
[1624.98s -> 1671.26s]  It's a game. It's a game. It's a game. Do they all have like a remix? Is this going to be like.
[1674.06s -> 1684.01s]  And then go like. And then go like kind of crazy. I hope so. Oh the last one did it.
[1684.73s -> 1701.85s]  Cool. All right. So this one is beer barrel polka. God save the king. Beethoven's fifth
[1702.41s -> 1712.74s]  scabbard stars and stripes. William Tell. Oh I know this one. The star spangled banner.
[1713.46s -> 1719.02s]  This is actually quite a lot. Sugar plum fairy.
[1722.30s -> 2110.10s]  Ball game. Wait is this. Oh yeah. Okay. I'm going to 100% this one.
[2122.42s -> 2183.42s]  Go. Give me an S. Oh. All right. I'll do entertainer. Everyone wants. Everyone wants me to do it.
[2187.06s -> 2199.08s]  Wait. I want to do William Tell. Let's go. This one's going to be nuts. Oh this one goes.
[2314.22s -> 2345.83s]  No way. No way. But that's all right. No way. But it's okay. Oh yeah. Let's go. Oh fuck. Hold on.
[2352.14s -> 2461.83s]  Oh my God. Why am I messing this up? Oh shit. My arm. I can't. Okay. Who hired this guy?
[2470.02s -> 2472.82s]  I got an A on that. I could probably do that better. I could do that much better.
[2479.38s -> 2488.07s]  Yeah. I can 100% do that better. You know I got to find a different way to sit. You know what I'm
[2488.07s -> 2494.07s]  saying? I feel like I want to be putting my arm forward more. Like leaning back and holding my
[2494.07s -> 2501.05s]  arm out like this. I have my whole arm and wrist on the mouse pad. All right. I'll do entertainer
[2501.05s -> 2517.46s]  now. Okay. Okay. Where is it? Entertainer. Okay. Here we go. There's over nine songs that feature
[2517.46s -> 2610.84s]  trombone. That's interesting. I didn't even think about that. That's a good song. All right. Now
[2610.84s -> 2631.54s]  let's do whatever. Do gladiators. Gladiators. Is that true? It takes a thousand people to make
[2631.54s -> 2732.76s]  one trombone. There's not enough room on my mouse pad. That song's called gladiators. Interesting.
[2733.40s -> 2743.64s]  How about skip to my loo? You know I'm going to get my keyboard off the desk area here. This is
[2743.64s -> 2817.77s]  better. That's like a mad Mario character. This piece of shit's not tuned. This piece of shit's
[2817.77s -> 2832.82s]  out of tune. That's what it was. This is really fun. Okay. What else is there? Is it this one?
[2833.90s -> 2843.51s]  Long Tail Limbo. Let's do it. Let's just do them all. Empty your spit valve.
[2843.51s -> 2938.07s]  Oh. What is this? Is this like Beethoven? Dude, Mozart was fucking lit. Don't ever say that word
[2938.07s -> 2952.49s]  again. Okay. Don't ever say that word again. All right. What about this? I want to do them all
[2952.49s -> 2959.34s]  before we do anything else. You know what I mean? Why not? What was Mozart's last word?
[2978.44s -> 3048.78s]  I had to get a Super Mario in there. That wasn't me. I didn't do that. I got an S on that one.
[3048.78s -> 3054.12s]  Actual fart. All right. One more. One more and then we'll go back and see what else we can do.
[3054.12s -> 3059.96s]  Professional trombone can cost over two billion. That's not even real.
[3110.18s -> 3167.53s]  That's gotta be an S. I was gonna say it has to be, right? It has to be. All right. So what else
[3167.53s -> 3180.79s]  can you do? Block. Jesus. Okay. What do I do? Collect? Welcome to your collection. Play the
[3180.79s -> 3184.63s]  main game to earn toots and then spend them on trombone cards. Can you collect all 50?
[3192.84s -> 3213.82s]  I've not done that. What? This is crazy. It's cards? What is this? Can I play with them or
[3213.82s -> 3249.03s]  something? This is so cool. This is so cool. This is not what I thought it was going to be,
[3249.03s -> 3258.30s]  by the way. This is like actually just collect interesting cool history on the trombone. That's
[3258.30s -> 3272.10s]  cool. You could eat up to 30. Wait, they're fake? Composer of more than 600 pieces. Mozart,
[3272.10s -> 3275.62s]  one of the most well-known classical composers of all time. He could eat up to 30 hot dogs in
[3275.62s -> 3286.33s]  one sitting. Oh, it's made up. Oh, maximalist electronic composer and producer of bespoke soups.
[3286.33s -> 3289.37s]  In addition to long tail limbo, he produced a trio of critically acclaimed albums,
[3289.37s -> 3297.48s]  which you should purchase immediately. American jazz trombonist who played with
[3297.48s -> 3302.04s]  Count Bassey was known for his plunger mute technique and literally wrote a book on plunger
[3302.04s -> 3308.98s]  techniques. As an American, he probably ate a ton of hot dogs. What's a hot dog thing?
[3308.98s -> 3315.91s]  Why? What's with the hot dogs? Oh, we already got Roswell all wrote already, right? Legendary
[3315.91s -> 3323.22s]  tromboner and composer who worked in free and avant-garde jazz taught ethnomusicology performed
[3323.22s -> 3328.50s]  with Malian and Mongolian musicians and could eat 900 hot dogs. What's with the hot dogs?
[3328.50s -> 3347.19s]  Whether or not he ate hot dogs is unknown. He ate, only ate hot dogs in private. One of the most
[3347.19s -> 3353.27s]  powerful tromboner cards, the red eyes black baboon is a representation of the bass clef
[3353.27s -> 3362.02s]  as it relates to Babi, the Egyptian deification of the sacred old world Hamadryas baboon. Did I get
[3362.02s -> 3374.30s]  it? Favorite clef of the primordial baboon toot-seeker tom. This clef represents light,
[3374.30s -> 3387.08s]  but there can be no light without dark. This has got to be some kind of inside joke with the devs,
[3387.08s -> 3404.79s]  right? He ate hot dogs sometimes, maybe. J.S. Bach invented the hot dog. The air horns are killing
[3404.79s -> 3445.59s]  me. What is a turd? A coward's trombone. Double his power level. He's a master of orchestration
[3445.59s -> 3459.54s]  and could eat a whole lot of hot dogs, although. Okay, let's just boom, open them. A glissando is
[3459.54s -> 3464.18s]  a slide from one tone to another. The trombone is one of the few instruments capable of performing
[3464.18s -> 3477.82s]  a true smooth glissando. This is, wait, 16th century Italian painter who painted what may
[3477.82s -> 3494.58s]  have been the first artistic depiction of a woman playing a trombone. Oh shit, there it is. It is
[3494.58s -> 3509.80s]  the alpha and the omega. Why? The trombones of the animal kingdom and are the descendants of Babi,
[3509.80s -> 3514.92s]  the bull of the baboons, who is a relative of the primordial baboons that watch over the twin toot
[3514.92s -> 3524.28s]  vessels. Legendary Jamaican Scott trombonist with a true history of mental illness and murder,
[3524.28s -> 3528.55s]  ultimately ending with his death at Bellevue Asylum in Kingston. Jeez.
[3538.10s -> 3542.34s]  Honestly, I thought that was Milhouse Manastorm for one second. I was like,
[3542.34s -> 3547.94s]  that's a funny joke. They put Milhouse Manastorm in here and they did. That's what the joke is.
[3547.94s -> 3553.14s]  That's what the joke is. I didn't read further than that. That was what the reference is.
[3554.66s -> 3564.60s]  I'm an idiot. Okay, Mozart music storm. This Austrian mage holds the key to the ear wing
[3564.60s -> 3576.49s]  of tempo keep. He will light you up with the sound of his sweet keys. Cool. Ancient Egyptian Babi.
[3579.05s -> 3599.78s]  I've got like five Roswell ruds. Very cool. Wait, should I do it like a Hearthstone pack opening?
[3609.22s -> 3622.63s]  Guys, okay. So we're looking for epics or legendaries. It's not here. What is this one?
[3623.03s -> 3633.43s]  Oh, all right. That's all right. That's a good one. That's okay. Very cool. This I could use
[3633.43s -> 3644.44s]  this in my I could use this in my in my warlock deck. I think what's under this one. You know,
[3644.44s -> 3650.12s]  I what I really want is I really hope that and by the way, this this takes like four hours to open
[3650.12s -> 3665.10s]  like 50 packs just in case you were wondering. Oh, okay. It's not it's it but it's close to
[3665.10s -> 3685.56s]  Mozart Manastorms. All right, come on. You always have to go somebody else click the button so I
[3685.72s -> 3707.56s]  can stay like this. Oh, do finger snaps. What is that? What is finger snaps?
[3707.56s -> 3716.38s]  Do people do finger snaps when they open packs? What did I do when I opened like crates in TF2?
[3716.38s -> 3736.41s]  What did I do? Did I do that? Did I go like this? I think I think I did. I did. Yeah, I actually did.
[3737.13s -> 3782.52s]  All right. So what else is there? Free improvisation. What is this? I don't understand.
[3782.52s -> 3813.91s]  I'd play music. I don't know how to play music. That's a sound effect in a Chrono Trigger or
[3813.91s -> 3821.42s]  something. What is that? It's a it's a move in Chrono Trigger or my RPG or something.
[3821.42s -> 3838.06s]  You doy doy doy. That's a mega. Oh, you got it. Thank God. I was gonna drive me crazy for the
[3838.06s -> 3849.80s]  next two weeks. It's the Mega Man charge up sound. They're like, dude, it real. Oh my thank God.
[3849.80s -> 3857.67s]  Thank you so much. That would have drove me nuts. Wait, I have to do it. I have to do it right,
[3857.67s -> 3874.14s]  though. I have to do it right. Otherwise, I won't be able to go to sleep. It's like it's slower.
[3875.32s -> 3887.10s]  Don't go so high. All right. I'm going to people going to leave. That's like annoying.
[3887.10s -> 3895.11s]  All right. Kirby. Yep. What's the hardest song in the game?
[3900.76s -> 4022.60s]  Crunchy. Very cool. All right. There's still more Trombone Skies. Let's go. Oh,
[4023.56s -> 4163.74s]  there's more to the songs. All right, we're good. I didn't blow it, right? Did I blow it?
[4164.38s -> 4189.66s]  Yeah, I'm good. Hell yeah. Let's go. Go back to Baboon. Go back to do it again. Click Baboon in
[4189.66s -> 4234.76s]  the menu. What the fuck is this? Are are thou the one who's been knocking on my little hatch?
[4234.76s -> 4245.11s]  Yes. Okay. I stick the Trombone champ. Is there a design wish to become the champ? Yes.
[4245.27s -> 4255.78s]  Yes. Primordial Baboon. Toot Seeker Tom. Feast eyes on the toot vessel.
[4259.74s -> 4263.26s]  What is it for? How does this affect my life personally? These are questions for which I
[4263.26s -> 4272.94s]  have long since forgotten answers. My bad. Feed it toots. Okay. I spent all my money on card packs.
[4273.50s -> 4285.24s]  Why did I do that? It's framped. Seek the Lord Vessel. Come back to me and feed me items.
[4285.24s -> 4304.17s]  You must succeed Lord Gwyn. All right. I spent all my money on card packs. That was dumb. All
[4304.17s -> 4313.45s]  right. Well, now I have to do it. I have to get it. I want to do every song I haven't done.
[4313.45s -> 4333.16s]  Fingers are cramping up. I thought this was. I thought this was the.
[4333.56s -> 4442.71s]  Hold on. I can't concentrate. Are you so red? Because I'm red. I don't know. I'm very flushed.
[4442.71s -> 4457.56s]  Did we do all the songs? Wait. This one is. This one's pretty crazy. Let's do an easy one.
[4457.56s -> 4531.85s]  We're gonna do an easy one. Hold on. Isn't this. Oh, wait a minute. Isn't this. Yeah, it's the same
[4531.85s -> 4565.94s]  song. We stole that song. All right. Skybird. Beans on toast? No way. What's that old Nickelodeon
[4565.94s -> 4579.34s]  show? Kablam? It's Ka-Blam. That's what this sounds like to me. That song was fucking awesome,
[4579.34s -> 4731.98s]  by the way. I like this a lot. I lost it a little bit there. Strawberry Magic 2 Waiting Room. True.
[4731.98s -> 4749.11s]  No, you. Everybody hated that. There was a huge chat war from that game. All right. That was fun.
[4749.11s -> 4754.04s]  All right. There's only a couple I haven't done. How about this one? I don't know the names of
[4754.04s -> 4758.50s]  these songs, but I recognize every single one of them. I look at them and I go, what is that?
[4758.50s -> 4894.76s]  And then I. You can do that? Never mind. All right. I was trying to see if I could
[4895.40s -> 4905.10s]  chain them together. I still got an ass. Who cares? All right. Let me do the one song I haven't done.
[4905.82s -> 4914.01s]  Oh, it's not this too. All right. Okay. Come on. This one's going to be crazy. I'm ready.
[4914.01s -> 5003.08s]  Why don't you ever blink? Good luck blinking during this. Oh, oh, that was cool. I like that
[5003.08s -> 5017.99s]  one. Blink. I have your stream muted. Well, I hope you're playing along with sheet music or something
[5017.99s -> 5030.71s]  because I don't know how you're watching. All right. I got this one. Blink once. You're going
[5030.71s -> 5140.28s]  to go crazy. I'm fine. I'm paying attention. Now I can blink. You give me one button,
[5140.28s -> 5144.33s]  you give me two buttons, give me three buttons. You give me up to four and I'll be fine.
[5144.33s -> 5152.04s]  Once we cross four buttons, I can't do anything. Give me a, you give me four buttons and I will
[5152.04s -> 5169.08s]  destroy it. Is this the only one we haven't done? How good are you at guitar hero? How many buttons
[5169.08s -> 5184.65s]  are on the guitar hero controller? Sorry. I don't play guitar hero very well at all. I cannot do
[5184.65s -> 5195.75s]  the fifth button in guitar hero. I can't do it. Is this why you played arcane mage? And wow,
[5195.75s -> 5269.78s]  that is such like an insane detailed insult. I thought I got an F. I thought I got an F.
[5269.86s -> 5280.98s]  Just play guitar hero on medium. No, I can't play it on medium. Oh, there's another one.
[5282.39s -> 5289.32s]  Old gray mirror. Not a real American, not a perfect score.
[5293.14s -> 5386.09s]  I was taking a sip. I was drinking my drink. Oh, that was nice. Imagine waiting for the weekend
[5386.09s -> 5391.58s]  Breath of the Wild stream and he just plays Snore Rancher 2 and Fart Simulator.
[5391.58s -> 5405.13s]  I'm playing Breath of the Wild in like half an hour. I think that's it, but it's not. I'm not
[5405.13s -> 5410.62s]  done. That's all the songs, right? Wait, let's go pay the trombone. The trombone thing.
[5412.26s -> 5423.80s]  All right. Is it trombone? It's trombone. Trombone. It's trombone. Snore Rancher. Yeah,
[5423.80s -> 5446.01s]  come on, man. It's trombone. Trombone or trombone? Trombone. Trombone. Trombone. Yeah,
[5446.01s -> 5454.36s]  trombone. Not trombone. The trombone. Maybe I guess you can say it either way, right?
[5454.36s -> 5472.26s]  Jesus. It awakens. New instrument.
[5485.69s -> 5498.84s]  Probably gone. Oh, I can do it again.
[5515.00s -> 5521.61s]  So I have to do this three times because look at where it's filled up.
[5541.13s -> 5556.22s]  Oops. Mute the game. I got to do it one more time. I got to get asked on something. I got
[5556.22s -> 5574.09s]  to do it one more time. Wait, muted. It's an instrument. Hold on. Let me try. So there's no
[5574.09s -> 5664.70s]  sounds. Sounds like chaos. What's his name? Animal Crossing. Slider. Did I miss one note?
[5664.70s -> 5688.65s]  KK Slider. Yeah. Should I get an S on the warm up? I want to unlock one more thing at least.
[5688.65s -> 5724.86s]  Play as the new character. Oh shit. Okay. Do it again. I can do it perfect. I got to do it
[5724.86s -> 5806.54s]  perfect. What's going on? I didn't miss a single note. All right. So that's, that's perfect. I
[5806.54s -> 5815.58s]  didn't miss a single one. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[5816.30s -> 5828.65s]  All right. How many points do I need? 2,500, right? All right. It's going to jump scare
[5828.65s -> 5843.26s]  everybody. Just be ready. Be aware. One more. The game looks fun. It is. Do the new character,
[5843.26s -> 5865.78s]  new character. All right. All right. Where's, oh, all right. I need more points. What was that
[5865.78s -> 5878.38s]  really cool one that we liked? What was that? What was the really cool one? Oh yeah. This one.
[5883.48s -> 5888.14s]  Yeah. This one. Wait, am I going to get points for doing this? I already got an S on it.
[5888.14s -> 6033.32s]  Do you get points if you completed something and you do it more? All right. Fuck that. I thought
[6033.32s -> 6043.29s]  the song was over. Sorry. That's better than the last time. Way better than the last time.
[6044.17s -> 6179.83s]  How come you're not singing the song? All right. Oh, oh, Langstein. Oh, Langstein. I wasn't ready
[6179.83s -> 6199.32s]  for this solo. That's better than the last time. Please blink. I'm fine. I'm blinking. All right.
[6199.32s -> 6222.15s]  Do I have enough points? He's a lizard. Wake up. I was a lizard. I'm just going to make,
[6222.15s -> 6227.75s]  I'm going to clear the record here. If I was a lizard, I would not be streaming. I'll be
[6227.75s -> 6242.98s]  lying outside on a fucking rock with my eyes just closed 14 to 15 hours a day, right in the sun.
[6242.98s -> 6258.57s]  You look like Shaggy. I know because I'm wearing a green shirt. It's a solid green shirt. You just,
[6258.65s -> 6266.78s]  you're Shaggy, I guess. Every time I wear this, people say Shaggy.
[6304.18s -> 6312.41s]  Eight bit. Oh, that's actually kind of cool. There's more. All right. I want to do that.
[6312.41s -> 6324.70s]  That sounds fun. I know I said I was going to play Breath of the Wild, but I want to hold on.
[6324.70s -> 6346.44s]  I'm not done. I can click on something here. Build card. Turd card. Wait, don't I? Oh,
[6346.92s -> 6373.59s]  these are my doubles. Should you ever have more than two? The chaos candle.
[6373.59s -> 6413.51s]  You're playing the clout chaser game. I'm having fun, man. That's a fun game. That's my legendary
[6413.51s -> 6462.70s]  trombone card. Oh, this is how you, okay. Silver trombone. So let's do it again.
[6462.70s -> 6509.10s]  Man. Let's go. That's got to be fastest ever. That's the fastest ever. I don't think anyone's
[6509.10s -> 6557.83s]  done it faster than that. Wait, what? No. Shit. I need, I just want to see what it looks like.
[6557.83s -> 6590.65s]  I want to see what it sounds like. All right. Let's do it. Let's do eight bit.
[6616.04s -> 6807.83s]  Why is your face crooked? I don't know. Blame God. I didn't get S. I started over. I fucked it up
[6807.83s -> 6810.71s]  and I got all fucked in my, I got all fucked up in my head and my head got all fucked up.
[6810.71s -> 6886.15s]  Let's do it again. I'm going to try space bar. No, that's, that's scratching your head and
[6886.15s -> 6996.33s]  rubbing your stomach at the same time. A little bit bad. I got at least an A. It was a B before
[6996.33s -> 7004.82s]  I got an A. All right. I want to take the eight bit sound effects off because it kind of hurts
[7004.82s -> 7014.68s]  my head. All right. We've got to get at least A, right? Entertainer. I got to get at least an A
[7014.68s -> 7196.97s]  and everything. That would have been an A. One more try and that's it. That's A. I think that's
[7196.97s -> 7205.08s]  it, right? Any more B's? No, I got all A's and S's. That's it. Can I afford anything else?
[7224.73s -> 7251.38s]  I can go higher than that. Not enough. I got an A on this. I got it. The ones that are easy,
[7252.18s -> 7260.36s]  I should be able to get S's on, right? Let me go back to this one. Seriously. Like I can do this
[7260.36s -> 7265.90s]  one. I screwed this one up big time. Here we go. I'm definitely going to get at least a better
[7265.90s -> 7311.78s]  score on this one. My finger hurts. I'm so mad. My, my finger started to like, I was like made of
[7311.78s -> 7322.12s]  a stone. I couldn't click. Use the keyboard. I can't. I have to use my right hand. You know
[7322.12s -> 7327.16s]  what? When you do, when you move too many times, it's like doing reps. The lactic acid like builds
[7327.16s -> 7529.74s]  up and it's just, I can't click anymore. 160 second break. My fucking finger hurts. Oh,
[7529.74s -> 7536.31s]  you just can't, man. No, you got to start with, you got to start with that one. I got a better
[7536.31s -> 7551.54s]  score. I got a better score. That's fine. It's the like, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, and having to click
[7551.54s -> 7568.54s]  and move. All right. What about, um, how about this one? I'm going to get this one to S. Take a break.
[7568.54s -> 7678.04s]  I'm a gamer. I can. That's an S right? Yes. All right. One more. That's it. One more and I'm done.
[7683.02s -> 7761.11s]  I thought it was going to be different than that. Start. Good start. Is that better than the last
[7761.11s -> 7770.12s]  one? Not by much. Fuck. It's all right. When you, it's just the, you know what I mean?
[7771.16s -> 7774.74s]  All right. Let me unlock my thing and then I'm going to switch to Breath of the Wild.
[7774.74s -> 7843.40s]  What do you do with that? I got everything out of that. What do we do with the key? Oh,
[7843.40s -> 7864.18s]  there's one more secret. Okay. I'll do it. Click this a bunch. I would have never figured that out.
[7883.83s -> 7907.66s]  Am I going to get a tuba? Okay. I just wanted you, I wanted you to give me the secret. I
[7907.66s -> 7932.84s]  didn't want you to leave. Yeah. All right. You said that.
[7933.40s -> 7990.46s]  Should Bassmaster Ben not stop in stopping the story? Did he not stop? Yes. Not. No.
[7990.46s -> 8010.55s]  The toot vessel and the turd vessel. Toot master Tom. I feel like that's, I feel like that's like
[8010.55s -> 8015.85s]  a hacker name in Dark Souls. I get invaded by that. It's like, okay, he's going to, he's
[8015.85s -> 8021.53s]  going to crash my computer. I got to be careful. There's like fucking toot master Tom or like turd,
[8021.53s -> 8059.90s]  turd vessel Tom. All right. Okay. I got the key though. Can I put the key somewhere?
[8062.92s -> 8067.56s]  Do you not want me to not repeat this full tale again or should I not simply continue?
[8068.44s -> 8073.42s]  Just tell me the answer. I don't even care. It's yes, right?
[8073.42s -> 8095.54s]  Build a vessel with turds. I don't have any turds. How do I get turds?
[8103.86s -> 8123.29s]  I have to dust cards. Oh, really? Should I just turd everything? Things I have doubles of?
[8123.93s -> 8176.50s]  This duplicates. Okay. Okay. So I gotta get some more packs, right? Okay. Cool. Any doubles?
[8177.14s -> 8207.75s]  Do you have enough turds? Yeah, but I'm going to need, I'm probably going to need to do it more
[8207.75s -> 8276.79s]  than once, right? Only do it, I don't have to do it once. Sound set in the club. I kind of,
[8276.79s -> 8305.70s]  I kind of need to do that. I'm just saying the amount of omega lulls that I've seen in the last
[8305.70s -> 8314.89s]  one straight minute that you tell me that my fart joke about farting like this star spangled
[8314.89s -> 8323.22s]  banner or something or like the fart thing with Holly that I'm, but I'm so, I'm so low brow,
[8323.22s -> 8326.84s]  apparently. Count the amount of omega lulls in the last one minute.
[8358.52s -> 8364.14s]  I don't want to hear it. I don't want to hear it from anybody. I want, I want the,
[8364.86s -> 8368.70s]  I want the mods to keep track of every chatter that omega lulls in the next
[8369.50s -> 8379.58s]  five minutes. I want you to keep track of every omega lull you see in the next five minutes
[8379.58s -> 8495.32s]  and then time them out for an hour. How many people are getting timed out? It was a lot.
[8503.75s -> 8676.31s]  It was including Twitch staff. Oh, fatigue is setting in. Oh, okay. That's better. All right.
[8676.87s -> 8690.92s]  I only, I want enough to unlock all the turds. All right, let's do one more. Only one more.
[8690.92s -> 8742.39s]  Just one more, one more, one more. Everyone relax. One more. Shut up. I did it. Perfect.
[8846.38s -> 8868.20s]  Well, 2.2 million dollars. Come on. That's gonna be better. It was a little bit better.
[8868.20s -> 8888.01s]  Oh my God. I forgot to blink. Look at this. Holy shit. Jesus. Oh, all right. What do we,
[8888.01s -> 8934.06s]  what do we got? Do I have enough? I'm just going to sell a lot of these. All right. What if I just
[8934.06s -> 8975.16s]  sell all of them? I need 750, 750, which is what? 1500. I need 1500. I'm close. I might just get it.
[8976.04s -> 9024.66s]  Can we omega all of these turds? Yeah, that's fine. So what is it?
[9040.12s -> 9054.34s]  Character, servant of Bobby. Okay. That's pretty cool. You know what I really wish was in this
[9054.34s -> 9060.41s]  game? And I know it's probably impossible, but there's probably so much money. But
[9060.41s -> 9070.33s]  imagine this was licensed games, not licensed games, licensed music. I feel like that would
[9070.33s -> 9088.36s]  be really, really funny. It'd be really cool. I think it's funny. There are mods for custom
[9088.36s -> 9109.02s]  songs. All right. That's really cool. I have a blue key and a red key. So what do I do with
[9109.02s -> 9121.32s]  the two keys? Okay. So I, I did everything with the turds. Now you are ready. You will need a
[9121.32s -> 9134.94s]  power level of 10 before combating the forces of order. Really? I have two keys now. How do I get
[9135.74s -> 9163.98s]  shit? The candle is the last one. Oh shit. You dare challenge me? Prepare thyself,
[9163.98s -> 9174.71s]  tromboner. What's going on?
[9285.40s -> 9291.34s]  You must yield the horn of legend. I must have a power level of at least 10
[9297.72s -> 9308.25s]  Okay. So you have to come here with the legendary trombone and beat it. Okay. That's cool. Um,
[9308.25s -> 9316.52s]  I think I'm done. You got to unlock everything. I don't know if I'm going to unlock everything.
[9317.24s -> 9325.32s]  My God, it's got chills up my whole spine. You never turned baboons up in the options.
[9326.34s -> 9335.02s]  Oh, I didn't. Yeah, that's true. That boon quality inferno, a boon preference, all of them.
[9335.98s -> 9352.82s]  Let me see what that does. I'm just curious. What the fuck is this? Is there more songs? Is
[9352.82s -> 9378.94s]  that a secret song? What was that? Where did that go? Where did that just go? If we go again. I'm,
[9378.94s -> 9410.36s]  I'm not even playing. All right. Goodbye. That was a really cool game. Fun game. Liked it a lot.
[9410.36s -> 9417.13s]  Very good. I would say it's a quality experience. Very fun. That was really cool. I liked it a lot.
[9417.77s -> 9423.61s]  I'm glad I played it. All right. Now, sorry, I slapped in your head. We're going to play
[9423.61s -> 9427.85s]  Breath of the Wild. I'm going to go take a piss break, make sure I get the switch set up correctly
[9428.57s -> 9445.88s]  back in like two, three minutes. See you soon. Be right back. Just kidding. Okay. Now I'll be back.
