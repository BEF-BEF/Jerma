[0.12s -> 7.29s]  Hey, what is going on everybody?
[7.29s -> 11.50s]  Jerma here with a live gameplay commentary.
[11.50s -> 15.34s]  Playing as the engineer with the new Eureka effect, soldier.
[15.34s -> 17.42s]  And you're probably saying to yourself,
[17.42s -> 20.06s]  damn it, to explain what you're talking about here, engineer.
[20.06s -> 26.14s]  Well, I will. The old Eureka effect was not really that good and it still ain't
[26.14s -> 31.18s]  really that good right now. The 50% slower repair rate and upgrade rate
[31.18s -> 36.54s]  takes 17 goddamn times before you get your central to zero to 200
[36.54s -> 40.71s]  or any of your other buildings, of course. But that's okay because now you can
[40.71s -> 45.11s]  teleport to spawn or you can teleport to an exit
[45.11s -> 48.71s]  whenever you happen to feel like it. So we're gonna let Jerma take over here.
[48.71s -> 53.03s]  He's gonna do a live commentary about the Eureka effect and I'm gonna go
[53.03s -> 58.10s]  and fill my diaper with shit. Oh, a sandwich.
[58.10s -> 61.56s]  That was delicious. That was delicious. That was delicious.
[61.56s -> 64.68s]  Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Not gonna waste any time here.
[64.68s -> 69.48s]  I'm gonna try to actually get the tele- I want to
[69.48s -> 73.80s]  show you the teleporter thing. I'm gonna try to- whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
[73.80s -> 80.34s]  Oh god, I hate when this happens. You get like the uber for two seconds and
[80.34s -> 83.94s]  you think, oh my, it must be a panic uber and you run out and then it ends on you
[83.94s -> 89.26s]  and you turn around running backwards and you just get absolutely annihilated.
[89.26s -> 93.02s]  We really can't get out of here. I'm gonna go for
[93.02s -> 96.79s]  Indiana Jones. Indiana Jones engineer. You guys ready?
[96.79s -> 101.50s]  This is what we call Indiana Jones. See, I helped.
[101.50s -> 106.12s]  I helped with that. Come on, give me the kill.
[106.12s -> 108.97s]  I'm just gonna put this here for just because to give a
[108.97s -> 110.81s]  distraction so I can come up here and kill this guy.
[110.81s -> 113.93s]  No, the soldier already get down. Okay, good job.
[113.93s -> 119.00s]  That was exactly what I was going to do. What the fuck?
[119.00s -> 124.31s]  Oh, was he standing right there? Did I just completely miss that guy?
[124.31s -> 128.79s]  Well, whatever. Now I have some time. I've got some time to build
[128.79s -> 134.02s]  up my entrances and stuff. Hopefully we don't just steam roll right now
[134.02s -> 139.14s]  because that would not be good because I do want to try this eureka effect thing.
[139.14s -> 142.94s]  I want to go teleport to the exit. I want to find myself in a
[142.94s -> 149.24s]  teleportation device. Okay, we're just gonna forget.
[149.24s -> 152.12s]  You know what? Let's try. No, that's a bad idea. I was...
[152.12s -> 157.85s]  Oh my god, I'm gonna stop burping. Let's build this just so I can carry it.
[157.85s -> 163.10s]  This is the worst part though. This takes so long.
[163.10s -> 168.04s]  Let's get that exit built right here. So now...
[168.04s -> 172.44s]  Shoot him! What the hell was that? Did you guys see that?
[172.44s -> 176.57s]  No, no, no, no, no, no. This ain't gonna happen.
[176.57s -> 181.56s]  I knew you needed like a two percent shot left.
[181.56s -> 185.16s]  But once this exit is built, I can do wacky
[185.16s -> 189.00s]  stuff like this. Let's see if I can do it. Here we go. And let's go back to base.
[189.00s -> 195.02s]  Let's fill up on our ammo. And then let's immediately go back to
[195.02s -> 202.12s]  the teleporter exit. Okay, here we are. So that's kind of cool. That's cool.
[202.12s -> 205.48s]  Is it good enough? I don't know, because look, it really does
[205.48s -> 210.68s]  take such an absurdly long time to build up your centuries and to
[210.68s -> 213.82s]  repair and everything. So I don't know, I guess if you like to
[213.82s -> 216.70s]  fly around and teleport around stuff, it's kind of cool.
[216.70s -> 224.47s]  But at the same time, at what cost? At what cost? This is a really bad idea
[224.47s -> 225.99s]  because I don't have the Wrangler, but you know,
[225.99s -> 229.91s]  he probably does. I wonder if he does. Well, this is a terrible idea.
[229.91s -> 232.97s]  This is like a, yeah, this is the worst idea I've ever had.
[232.97s -> 242.97s]  Yeah, hey, hey, get him. Spray him. What? Oh, well that sucks. That really
[242.97s -> 245.35s]  sucks. What is this guy doing? This guy's like
[245.35s -> 252.79s]  inside of the door. Oh, I need some ammo to be the refill.
[252.79s -> 260.62s]  Let's get a dispenser up right here. Are we moving? Kind of. We're kind of
[260.62s -> 267.13s]  moving. Yeah, sort of. Let's build this up here.
[267.13s -> 271.50s]  That's probably a better idea. Better idea?
[271.50s -> 275.16s]  Maybe. I just, I don't have the Wrangler on, which is
[275.16s -> 280.86s]  not going to help me that much. Yeah, this is bad. It's all right though.
[280.86s -> 284.14s]  A little bit of distraction. It'll get probably one or two kills. It'll get this
[284.14s -> 286.92s]  guy too. No, maybe not. Well, if yeah, actually if
[286.92s -> 291.14s]  this guy peeks out, yeah, he's dead. This guy's dead because here comes a demo.
[291.14s -> 294.86s]  Fighting him. I'll just, you don't screw it. I'll go down there and get him. Wait
[294.86s -> 296.54s]  a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a
[296.54s -> 301.58s]  minute. Wait just one minute. Yes. I was going to say,
[301.58s -> 309.05s]  it's, that guy's not real. Oh, I need, I need my stuff. I gotta go back up
[309.05s -> 313.46s]  there and grab the sentry. Dispenser's gonna have to die,
[313.46s -> 317.46s]  unfortunately, because like I don't really care to repair it or bring it
[317.46s -> 323.27s]  because we're moving too fast. Come here. And we're about to get this
[323.27s -> 328.46s]  next spawn. So, life of an offensive engineer. You're
[328.46s -> 334.20s]  just constantly moving. But it's fun though. It's a fun time.
[334.20s -> 339.30s]  Where's that guy go? That's a spy. Oh, shit. No, don't go up there.
[339.30s -> 341.54s]  Get, please tell me you're gonna kill that Pyro because I really don't want to
[341.54s -> 345.59s]  deal with him. Come on, build, build, build, build.
[345.59s -> 350.44s]  You're, yeah, you're still alive. Still alive. I'm gonna have to do spy callout.
[350.44s -> 356.79s]  Spy creeping around here. Where is he? Which one? He's probably gonna appear
[356.79s -> 361.06s]  right next to me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[361.06s -> 366.65s]  Well, I'll just have to kill you. Well, no, I won't kill you. Somebody else will.
[366.65s -> 374.55s]  Get out of here. Damn, dude. You're making my life hard.
[374.55s -> 378.47s]  Can somebody just get rid of that little mini sentry so I can build this?
[378.47s -> 385.29s]  Oh, damn. Kill him before he gets the sentry.
[387.74s -> 391.61s]  Holy shit, what the fuck is going on up there? I'm dead.
[391.61s -> 395.85s]  I'm gonna burn. Bye. But, please, there's like five people.
[395.85s -> 405.56s]  There's an entire crew in that room. Oh, my god. This sentry is doing so much
[405.56s -> 409.69s]  work right now. Why do I not have an exit built? I could
[409.69s -> 417.90s]  just teleport right to it right now. This thing. They have a teleporter in
[417.90s -> 423.24s]  here? Is that what this has to be, right? Yeah, they do. All right. Well, let's just
[423.24s -> 428.50s]  get rid of this stuff. I'm so sorry that you're dead. I'm so
[428.50s -> 432.04s]  sorry that you died right there. Nothing I could have done.
[432.04s -> 437.93s]  Nothing that could be done. We actually might win this right now.
[437.93s -> 441.77s]  I have, like, not shown the Eureka effects, like, cool abilities,
[441.77s -> 446.73s]  like, really yet. I've shown it, like, one time. We're just playing, like, engineer.
[446.73s -> 448.81s]  All right, now we're gonna show up, because I'm gonna have an opportunity
[448.81s -> 454.73s]  here to build an exit right here. Exit's gonna, by the time this is built,
[454.73s -> 457.05s]  so here's the strategy. Here's the, here's the strat right here. We're gonna try to
[457.05s -> 460.25s]  get this thing built. I'm gonna teleport back to spawn. So,
[460.25s -> 465.42s]  here we go. Teleporting back to spawn. Let's go, fill up, and then immediately
[465.42s -> 471.24s]  come back. Very good. And there you go. We are back.
[471.24s -> 475.96s]  I can build. Actually, I should destroy that so I can build one down here.
[475.96s -> 479.50s]  And, you know, we're gonna do it again. We're gonna do it again. We're gonna go
[479.50s -> 482.14s]  right back to spawn and come right back immediately.
[482.14s -> 490.26s]  Fill up, come right back. Hello. Yes, that is very cool. Who was it? What?
[490.26s -> 496.47s]  Oh, it's this guy. Well, don't. What is this guy doing?
[496.47s -> 501.83s]  What was that guy doing? Let's get this to level three,
[501.83s -> 506.31s]  and then we're gonna build an entrance so people can actually use this thing.
[506.31s -> 511.24s]  That would be ideal, right?
[511.48s -> 518.81s]  Oh, should I move this? I feel like this is not
[518.81s -> 521.30s]  really doing, yeah, it's not really doing that much right now.
[521.30s -> 528.17s]  We're moving too fast. Hey, spy. Block him. Block him. He's right here
[528.17s -> 535.90s]  somewhere. Where? I don't know. He's down here.
[535.90s -> 541.26s]  Get this. Come on, come on, come on. Hurry up. Get to level three already.
[541.26s -> 544.81s]  Oh, damn it. Oh, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it.
[544.81s -> 549.80s]  It's okay. Here's the deer. Here's the deer. We are going to go back to spawn. I'm
[549.80s -> 554.71s]  going to build the entrance right out here. So,
[554.71s -> 561.26s]  entrants go up, bring you right to the action, and you know, while that's
[561.26s -> 564.90s]  building, let's just go ahead and teleport to the exit.
[564.90s -> 572.78s]  Hello. All right. Sentry going up, but this one I want like...
[572.78s -> 578.36s]  No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't think so. I just don't think so. Not today.
[578.36s -> 583.59s]  Not today. And what do we say to the god of death?
[583.59s -> 589.27s]  Not today. It's built. Is this? No, it's not level three. This is going to take
[591.62s -> 601.18s]  Ugh. What a snooze. What a total snooze. I would have been already done by now.
[601.18s -> 605.21s]  Well, it's level two now. At least it's level two. We'll just get it to level
[605.21s -> 608.15s]  three. Why not? I mean, what else am I doing
[608.15s -> 611.22s]  right now? I'm just sitting here being a fucking
[611.22s -> 618.30s]  dingus. I don't want to get backstabbed. That would not be cool.
[618.30s -> 622.49s]  Level three. Oh my god, somebody's calling me.
[622.49s -> 631.96s]  On the... Get... Move. Leave me alone. I don't want to be called right now. There
[632.04s -> 636.84s]  we go. Let's move. Let's get some action in here.
[636.84s -> 640.52s]  That was a good like three full minutes of me hitting things with a wrench.
[640.52s -> 647.24s]  So we got that. Got that covered. And there's a pyro dead. There's another
[647.24s -> 651.58s]  pyro that's gonna die. That's two dead pyros. Let's get on it.
[651.58s -> 655.59s]  Move, move, move, move, move, move, move. Now I'll get off of it because there's
[655.59s -> 662.17s]  somebody trying to come destroy my stuff. He's dead. There's another guy over here
[662.17s -> 669.50s]  just on fire. All right. We are going... No, we're not going to destroy that yet.
[669.50s -> 674.46s]  Oh, I wish this thing was the rescue ranger. Where am I going?
[674.46s -> 679.29s]  I'm not sure what I'm doing here, guys, but I did it.
[679.29s -> 683.78s]  Well, let's get on. Let's push it. We don't gotta go far.
[683.78s -> 689.45s]  Exit. Exit strategy. This thing still shooting? It is.
[689.45s -> 693.05s]  I may leave this back here just for the denial, the area denial, if anyone wants
[693.05s -> 698.09s]  to come back here and screw with us. But then again, it might not be a terrible
[698.09s -> 705.10s]  idea to bring it to the front lines. And let's...
[705.10s -> 711.24s]  He's a dead ringer. Can I come back in time? Yes, I can.
[711.24s -> 715.85s]  But we are right here anyways. Yeah, this... I can destroy my
[715.85s -> 720.38s]  exit. There's no reason to have it right now. Can't really build... Unless I could
[720.38s -> 722.86s]  do this, I'm gonna try for something really, really...
[722.86s -> 727.51s]  I wonder if I can do it. If I can do it, it'll be really cool.
[727.51s -> 733.61s]  Let's get rid of the entrance and let's try to build an exit. Just an exit down
[733.61s -> 739.67s]  here where nobody cares to look. Oh, but no, I'm being chased.
[739.67s -> 745.83s]  Shit. I didn't realize like three people were still chasing me.
[745.83s -> 750.58s]  All right, we gotta end this. I gotta go power class. We needed power.
[750.58s -> 755.22s]  Engineer was just not doing it at the moment. And what is happening and how is
[755.22s -> 760.09s]  this guy still killing everybody? Let me get that medic.
[760.09s -> 763.59s]  Let me get that medic. Let's do it. Me and you, baby.
[763.59s -> 768.02s]  Me and you. We're gonna take on the whole world.
[768.02s -> 772.60s]  All right, I'll just turn the corner and just get exploded by a
[772.68s -> 777.51s]  rocket. This is the one. This is the one. We only have two minutes and 28 seconds.
[777.51s -> 783.69s]  This has to happen now. I got a telephrag. All right.
[783.69s -> 788.50s]  I'll take a telephrag. Here we go. Here we go. This is the push.
[788.50s -> 793.16s]  We got it. Here we go. This is the one. This is the push.
[793.16s -> 800.44s]  Come on now. Geez, man. They got so much stuff and so many people. This is not the
[800.44s -> 805.05s]  push. I don't think this is the push at all.
[805.05s -> 809.06s]  That didn't hit him. You've gotta be kidding me.
[809.06s -> 814.02s]  That hit somebody. Any more medics? Where'd you go, man? Where'd you go?
[814.02s -> 821.16s]  Where'd you go? I need some heals. I need some heals.
[821.16s -> 827.75s]  Man, oh man. Come on now. Here we go. Come on.
[827.75s -> 832.70s]  Everybody get on it. We got some advantage here. We got an advantage.
[832.70s -> 838.90s]  We got the slight advantage. Come on, drop down.
[838.90s -> 843.22s]  Oh, I got fucking backstabbed. No. God damn it. I was gonna detonate that.
[843.22s -> 846.90s]  We got it. We got it. We got it. Come on. Everybody get on there.
[846.90s -> 855.06s]  All human beings get on there. Come on. I gotta get out there. I gotta get out there.
[855.06s -> 859.74s]  It's so close. We have one minute. One minute.
[859.74s -> 865.16s]  One minute. They're all going over there. It didn't hit anybody.
[865.16s -> 869.00s]  Come on. I don't think we're gonna do it. No, don't be bad attitude. That was a bad
[869.00s -> 874.65s]  attitude. Let's go. Get it. I died. Shit.
[874.65s -> 881.40s]  Oh, unless we get up there right now. 46 seconds.
[881.40s -> 888.26s]  Come on now. Let's just do this thing. Spoke too soon. That's
[888.26s -> 892.41s]  a spy. Shit, if I just couldn't aim my weapon.
[892.41s -> 898.22s]  That guy would have died a long time ago. Go this way. I'm going this way.
[898.22s -> 903.93s]  No, I'm not. Too many scouts. Don't care. I'm wrapping around.
[903.93s -> 907.82s]  Wrap all the way around. I got full ammo. Full loaded.
[907.82s -> 913.69s]  There we go. Scout doesn't know. Neither does the spy.
[913.69s -> 920.23s]  Now he does. All right. We just gotta get this heavy. Gotta get this heavy up here.
[920.23s -> 925.00s]  Get on it. Just get on it. Stop bottling. Come on.
[925.00s -> 929.56s]  Get on it. Come on, everybody. I'm getting off. I'm getting off. You gotta get off
[929.56s -> 931.64s]  right now because you gotta help out the team. You gotta get the
[931.64s -> 938.47s]  people that are going in. That's a critscreek.
[938.47s -> 943.42s]  This is too intense for my brain. Come on, push it.
[943.42s -> 949.02s]  I don't care about the gloves. No. No.
[951.10s -> 955.24s]  We were close. That's gonna wrap it up though. Thank you, everybody, so much for
[955.24s -> 959.80s]  watching. This has been Rage Demo and EurekaSnooze Best Engineer. Thank
[959.80s -> 962.76s]  you for watching.
