[0.31s -> 13.62s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? It's Jerma here with a vlog, and this is a kind of a
[13.62s -> 20.38s]  special vlog because, oh, spoiler, spoiler alert, there he is. That's my new dog. His
[20.38s -> 25.70s]  name is Otto, and I just got him last night. Me and my mother drove to Rhode Island to
[25.70s -> 30.99s]  pick him up. Hey, come here. Say hello to people. Come here. Can you see him? Look at
[30.99s -> 35.07s]  how, my God, my room is the messiest room I've ever seen in my life. Come here, you.
[35.07s -> 43.92s]  Come here. He's a little shy. So here he is. And why don't you look in the camera. Say
[43.92s -> 49.87s]  hello to the viewers. Look, see, he's a Dachshund, Doberman, Beagle. We don't even know what the
[49.87s -> 55.65s]  hell he is, but he's a rescue dog. And he's one years old, I think, one and a half, something
[55.65s -> 61.51s]  like that. We're not exactly sure how old he is exactly, but he's from Tennessee. That's
[61.51s -> 67.96s]  all I remember. But yeah, those of you that do know, I had a dog that passed away two
[67.96s -> 76.12s]  or three weeks ago. So this is kind of the, not really the replacement, but it's the continuation
[76.12s -> 80.76s]  of the dog lineage, because we used to have a Dachshund. He died and wanted to get another
[80.76s -> 85.48s]  dog, wanted to fill the shoes of the old one, so to speak. And he's doing a great job. He's
[85.48s -> 90.06s]  a fantastic dog. Look at him. Look at how shy he is. He's just burying his nose into
[90.06s -> 96.15s]  my arm. What's wrong with you? Huh? Okay, you can get down. So really the second order
[96.15s -> 103.82s]  of business of the video is, I just, I'm about to pass 20,000 subscribers. And guys, that is
[103.82s -> 111.67s]  unbelievable. That is insane. I just passed 15,000 like last month or something. You guys are
[111.67s -> 117.03s]  unbelievable. I have no words to really describe how amazing all you guys are for subscribing to
[117.03s -> 120.55s]  this channel and for keeping up with the content and for supporting and all the support, everything
[120.55s -> 127.83s]  you guys do. It's phenomenal. So huge, huge thank you so much for 20,000 subscribers. I can't
[127.83s -> 134.68s]  believe I'm actually saying that, but thank you. And to kind of add to that, I got another one of
[134.68s -> 139.96s]  those ridiculous videos planned. Probably not till 25,000 subscribers, but it's coming. So
[140.70s -> 145.82s]  be ready for that. We're going to do something wacky as usual. So Otto, you want to say goodbye?
[145.82s -> 152.73s]  His name's Otto. Did I say that? I hope I did. So Otto, say goodbye. See you later. Nice to meet
[152.73s -> 155.37s]  everybody. I hope you all have a good day.
