[2.55s -> 13.82s]  What is sicko mode? What is that? I just keep seeing it. I don't know what it is. Is it a
[13.82s -> 28.76s]  Spongebob reference? I see it on Spongebob videos. Yes. Yeah, it's a rap song from Spongebob.
[33.43s -> 39.53s]  You are sick, so you are in the sick mode. Yeah, I'm sick in a couple of strange ways.
[44.33s -> 50.95s]  Somebody just fall up! Yeah, we gotta fall up! I can't be loud. I'll explain what's going on
[51.67s -> 54.79s]  to everybody that's out of the loop. Like, where the fuck has he been for three days?
[55.75s -> 62.31s]  Yeah, just wait. We'll just let some people trickle in and we'll discuss all these things, okay?
[63.11s -> 106.06s]  See you in just a second. Hey, so I'm seeing some people say it was the seaman mic and I hate to
[106.06s -> 113.91s]  think that that's even remotely possible. No, I don't think it was. This is uh, that would be
[113.91s -> 122.44s]  horrible. I would not sleep for the rest of my life if I knew that that's what it was. If I
[122.44s -> 127.43s]  actually shoved the butthole mic up the ass in the mouth, I would have been really bad. This is not
[127.43s -> 135.29s]  even an M rated stream. I gotta, what am I doing? You know, this is not a, I'm not one of those like
[135.29s -> 150.89s]  18 plus streams. I better, I better cut it out. We said the F word, which is, was that 18? No,
[150.89s -> 159.34s]  no, no, no, no, no. They said, they said fucking venom. PG-13 is now allowed like two or three
[159.34s -> 170.78s]  fucks and shits, right? Why is there not another rating? You know, there should be two more ratings.
[173.05s -> 182.95s]  One like 30 plus and have it be movies like the notebook. You can't go to that movie unless you're
[182.95s -> 192.18s]  30. There should be another one. Okay, so PG-13 and then you get all the way to 18. No, this should
[192.18s -> 199.58s]  be like a, this should be like a, I don't know. I don't know. How do you fix that? I used all my
[199.58s -> 208.44s]  swears from today. It's called NC-17. NC-17 doesn't exist. That Peggy 16. There it is. The Europeans
[208.44s -> 217.26s]  know what they're doing. They got it right. You understand, Peggy 16. Why do we have Peggy's 13?
[217.90s -> 223.38s]  I don't understand. The America's got to get with the times, man.
[229.69s -> 240.42s]  Yeah, Peggy 33. You see like a Peggy 16. That is a god of war.
[245.70s -> 254.87s]  The next trailer that you get at E3, Peggy 33. Hidden object game. Look, I see it over there.
[254.87s -> 266.87s]  Do you see it? Anyways, let's go over a couple things before we get started with Hypno Space
[267.51s -> 274.44s]  Enforcer. I've been gone for a few days, not because I wanted to be gone, because I had
[275.08s -> 283.16s]  some medical problems. Those of you that know that I have migraines and sometimes they're okay,
[283.16s -> 288.41s]  sometimes they're bad, sometimes they're not so bad. Usually if I have one maybe every couple
[288.41s -> 295.13s]  months and what it does is it kind of puts me out of commission for six to eight hours or so. I'll
[295.13s -> 300.81s]  be okay and then I can get back to normal. I had a migraine two days ago, two or three,
[300.81s -> 306.31s]  whatever it was. It was the day after the sea man stream and it was the worst migraine I've had in
[306.31s -> 312.57s]  probably three or four years. It was horrible. I feel like I was in the exorcist. I believe in
[312.57s -> 316.49s]  exorcism now because it happened to me. A demon fucking came out of my body. There's no way it
[316.49s -> 326.79s]  didn't. They must have been a priest. They must have been doing an exorcism two doors down and
[326.79s -> 332.42s]  it didn't work. The priest is sitting there going, I don't understand why this is not working. This
[332.42s -> 338.50s]  child is obviously possessed. He ends up leaving. They have like tea and shit and I'm just sitting
[338.50s -> 352.62s]  there in my bed like. So a priest, if you're watching, it worked. It worked on me, but it
[352.62s -> 358.15s]  shut me off for two days and then for some reason all of my digestive problems came back
[359.35s -> 367.75s]  the next day. So I've been kind of working at like 60% the last day or two. That's why I didn't want
[367.75s -> 373.83s]  to stream because I didn't want to have some like sick shitty stream or I'm just like turning it on
[373.83s -> 382.47s]  like, okay guys, here we go. Hey guys, so we're gonna play. No. So what I'm gonna do is I still feel
[383.46s -> 387.64s]  kind of sloppy. So I don't know how long this stream is going to be. We're just going to kind
[387.64s -> 395.24s]  of play it by ear. I do plan on streaming tomorrow and maybe the next day depends,
[395.80s -> 403.88s]  but I'm gonna take another few days off. I have a couple of friends coming in, like my mother's
[403.88s -> 409.48s]  coming in soon over the next 30 days here. My friend's coming in like next week. I have to be
[410.12s -> 415.50s]  healthy. So I'm gonna have to take another couple days off, probably three or four days off,
[415.50s -> 418.68s]  because I want to go to the doctor and just see what the fuck's going on. Because this,
[418.68s -> 425.38s]  it was the worst migraine I've had in years, like I said. So pardon my absence over the next,
[425.38s -> 431.35s]  probably as of stream today, stream tomorrow, maybe stream the next day, and then I'm probably
[431.35s -> 440.07s]  going to be gone for like three, four days. Can we meet your mom? Maybe. If she's comfortable
[440.07s -> 448.14s]  doing that, maybe. I mean, you've already met her, but anyways, let's get started. So pardon my
[448.14s -> 456.33s]  potential. Is he off today? He seems off today. I am. So just want to get that out of the way.
[456.41s -> 460.41s]  I get to have a, that's just great. I get to have a blanket statement. Oh, you know, guys,
[460.41s -> 467.67s]  the stream like not going to be good today. Perfect. That means you have such a low expectation.
[467.67s -> 481.59s]  I'm going to pull the rug up from underneath you. Let's get this off. And here we are. So what I
[481.59s -> 485.93s]  know about this game, there's only a few things that I know, is that actually, I don't know
[485.93s -> 490.17s]  anything at all. I know this is a game where you pretend to go on the internet in the 90s,
[490.17s -> 498.74s]  and I figured it was in slightly relaxing kind of hangout stream, and maybe it's not.
[498.74s -> 507.05s]  Maybe I'm going to trigger a new migraine. We'll find out. But if you weren't alive,
[507.05s -> 516.39s]  if you're not a 90s kid, then you're not going to know what this is like. Just read the title.
[516.39s -> 529.37s]  Okay. So I know that you're an enforcer and you have to scour the internet for bad pages.
[529.37s -> 533.56s]  I don't know. Okay. Enter your name. Custom pronunciation. What the hell does that mean?
[533.56s -> 554.44s]  Should it be like that? Custom pronunciation? Is that better? No, this is fine.
[559.80s -> 563.16s]  How? What does this mean? Custom pronunciation. German.
[567.67s -> 574.82s]  That? German. Okay. Should I have the custom pronunciation be the 985?
[574.82s -> 591.37s]  German 985. No, no, no. It's not 85. German 985. There it is. 85. No, I don't want to say that.
[591.37s -> 607.03s]  Just German is fine. Hypno OS version 1.04 November 5, 1999. Double click the question
[607.03s -> 619.38s]  mark to begin. It is 1999. This is 1105. This is November 5th. Or no, it's not. This is the day.
[619.38s -> 628.44s]  I have no idea. Is this British? Is this a British game? All right. Here's the settings.
[628.44s -> 633.70s]  This is the fitness tab. Here's the app menu. Okay. Let's double click here.
[636.82s -> 644.42s]  The future is you. Turn it up a little. Your passion, your imagination.
[645.30s -> 649.14s]  I love the compressed video. Your hard work. We're used to seeing this shit.
[649.14s -> 656.52s]  And now, with the help of hypnospace, you have the tools. Remember that. Tense already. Remember
[656.52s -> 665.42s]  that clock. To make it a reality. Witness the dawning of a new world where sleep time is no
[665.42s -> 670.22s]  longer downtime. You turn into a... It's where the future is built. You turn into like a serial
[670.22s -> 680.23s]  commercial advertising. A future built by you. Hypnospace. You turn into a gushers commercial
[680.23s -> 685.43s]  advertisement. Welcome to hypnospace patrol department enforcer training. Okay. Enforcer
[685.43s -> 695.66s]  training. I like this is going to be fun. Is it? Okay. Begin training. Hello, German.
[699.45s -> 703.29s]  There he is. Thank you for volunteering to help keep our wonderful community of hypnospace
[703.29s -> 709.05s]  citizens safe. Hypno-S enforcer edition is different from the standard version of Hypno-S
[709.05s -> 714.01s]  in several key areas. Okay. This tutorial will guide you through everything you need to know
[714.01s -> 718.33s]  to best serve your fellow hypnospace citizens. What's with the WarioWare guy here? What's with
[718.33s -> 734.06s]  the WarioWare face? Let's do this. Why does everybody have like a WarioWare avatar? Okay.
[735.88s -> 744.23s]  Using hypnos. Direct your attention to the top of your desktop and you'll notice the
[744.23s -> 749.91s]  hypnos info bar. From left to right, this handy toolkit features quick access to...
[749.91s -> 756.74s]  You're old. To the settings menu. What? The quick switcher.
[759.74s -> 769.42s]  The application menu. I love this. The current date and time. Your hypno coin balance. Hypno coin?
[769.42s -> 774.14s]  The restart and log off buttons. Where do I get those? Make sure to click the log off button to save
[774.14s -> 780.86s]  your progress and safely exit Hypno-S. The info bar may be repositioned anywhere along the top
[780.86s -> 788.26s]  or bottom of your desktop. Okay. You can move it around. The settings menu you can do. I'll
[788.26s -> 795.32s]  probably just open that now. How are we doing on volume? Probably fine. Sound effects, sound effects,
[796.84s -> 802.28s]  special effects, key special effects, mouse special effects, caption, all hype speech,
[803.08s -> 809.90s]  uh, autoplay, rage music, page music, voice speed. Hypno space is great.
[811.42s -> 820.04s]  Okay, that's fine. Turn it up a little. Robot language only. That's just fine. Pizza? Display.
[824.86s -> 829.35s]  What wallpaper should we have? These ones are gonna hurt my head. In fact, all of these are
[829.35s -> 842.10s]  gonna hurt my head. Which one is gonna hurt the least? Probably this one. Oops. Now that one's
[842.10s -> 857.05s]  fine. Theme. Olivine alloy eggplant. Screen saver. Oozle drip. That's probably the one. Yep. Wow,
[857.05s -> 867.05s]  this is really scratching the 90s computer itch. No, I don't want that one. That one's cool.
[869.78s -> 881.53s]  Wow, computers really did suck. Kids make this shit in Roblox now. Humans are progressing too
[881.53s -> 893.14s]  fast. Somebody set up Minecraft electricity blocks and probably made this. This has been
[893.14s -> 903.54s]  10 to 15 years. Why are we going so fast? What's gonna happen in like another 20 years?
[904.26s -> 909.96s]  It's called redstone. Yeah, whatever. That's, I know. All right. Pizazz. Mouse trail. Uh,
[911.29s -> 922.54s]  that shit's fucking annoying. Is that, doesn't this mean less mouse trail?
[925.05s -> 929.03s]  No, there we go. Yeah, I don't want the, like, I'm on mushroom's mouse.
[929.67s -> 938.94s]  12 hour time. That's good. Double click icons. Okay. All right. Sounds good. Nice smooth mouse
[938.94s -> 946.58s]  experience. The streamers on mushrooms. Set captions. Yeah, I probably should do that too,
[946.58s -> 960.06s]  shouldn't I? Caption all high piece speech. Okay, let's go. Did I do the pizza menu? I did. Yeah,
[960.06s -> 965.74s]  I just want to make sure. Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. All right. Next. I can move this around too.
[965.74s -> 971.26s]  It's fine up there. Hippie, also known as the hypnospace intelligent intermediary, is your
[971.26s -> 976.54s]  digital helper. He'll notify you when you receive important messages and even alert you to new
[976.54s -> 984.44s]  hypno-ass system updates. Hippie is always happy to help. Here's a useful tip. Right click any text
[984.44s -> 990.60s]  in hypnospace and Hippie will read it out loud. Whether you're new to hypnospace or a veteran
[990.60s -> 996.20s]  citizen, you've come to the right place. It's like the manager's talking in the background.
[998.81s -> 1003.94s]  Okay, so you can right click any text and he'll read it out loud. Okay. Enable
[1003.94s -> 1011.54s]  caption in settings for additional captions. Digital helper. Yep. So let's see.
[1012.74s -> 1019.18s]  Thank you for volunteering to help keep our wonderful community of hypnospace citizens safe.
[1019.18s -> 1025.74s]  Hypno-s enforcer edition is different from the standard version of hypno-s in several key areas.
[1025.74s -> 1029.98s]  This tutorial will guide you through everything you need to know to best serve your fellow
[1029.98s -> 1037.18s]  hypnospace citizens. I'm getting some real 3D movie maker vibes. Let's do this. All right,
[1037.18s -> 1044.14s]  select a topic. Let's see. We've got chime laws, HSPD inbox, HSPD cases, investigating citizens
[1044.14s -> 1048.86s]  enforcement tools. What about the, let's go laws. Chime is an easy way to remember the five types
[1048.86s -> 1054.46s]  of violations that we'd like enforcers to keep an eye out for. C stands for content infringement.
[1054.46s -> 1061.66s]  H is for harassment. I for illegal activity. M for malicious software. And E is for extralegal
[1061.66s -> 1067.26s]  commerce. Find more information in the HSPD handbook. Extralegal? Does that mean that
[1067.26s -> 1071.18s]  a lawyer is there every time you make a transaction? He just sits there and watches
[1071.18s -> 1080.97s]  you transact the money. How about it's extralegal? Beyond legal. Outside of the law. Why would it just
[1080.97s -> 1088.33s]  be illegal? Sue, that's so legal. I've got a notary, a lawyer, and a doctor there watching
[1088.33s -> 1094.60s]  me transact my muffin business. All right, so content infringement. We're going to like content
[1094.60s -> 1100.98s]  ID claim, harassment, illegal content, malicious software. All right, let's say click the video to
[1100.98s -> 1106.90s]  pause and resume. Okay, so we chime. Let me see. I got to remember that. Chime, content infringement.
[1106.90s -> 1113.43s]  I'm not looking at the screen. H, harassment. I, infection of software. No, illegal content. Okay.
[1114.07s -> 1123.26s]  I is illegal. M is for malicious software. E is extralegal. So why is there an I and an E?
[1123.90s -> 1130.41s]  Illegal content and extralegal content. Okay, but this is commerce. So this is okay. All right.
[1131.61s -> 1134.90s]  You don't need to memorize this. Oh, all right. There we go.
[1134.90s -> 1143.26s]  Thank you for volunteering to help keep our wonderful community of hypno space citizens safe.
[1143.26s -> 1149.26s]  Hypno S enforcer edition is different from the standard version of Hypno S in several key areas.
[1149.90s -> 1154.86s]  This tutorial will guide you through everything you need to know to best serve your fellow hypnos.
[1154.86s -> 1160.46s]  The HSPD enforcer dashboard is a special secure program that only our volunteer
[1160.46s -> 1165.42s]  enforcers have access to. Nice. The inbox allows you to receive messages from merchant soft,
[1165.42s -> 1171.42s]  hypno space, or HSPD dispatch agents. You may also receive automated communications from
[1172.94s -> 1178.54s]  some messages come with files attached. Attached files will appear at the top of the
[1178.54s -> 1184.94s]  message and look like this. Attached files will be downloaded to your Hypno S download manager.
[1185.74s -> 1193.11s]  But then what am I supposed to do? Read messages sent from the dispatch to or automated
[1193.11s -> 1197.43s]  communications from hypnos space pages. Some messages contain file attachments which are stored
[1197.43s -> 1201.83s]  in the download manager. So what if somebody sends me illegal content? What am I supposed to
[1201.83s -> 1210.63s]  do? Report them? Is there a report button? The cases tab opens as a database of all cases
[1210.63s -> 1217.03s]  you've accepted. Most of your time will be spent on cases assigned to you by an HSPD dispatch agent.
[1217.03s -> 1222.23s]  Cases are generated in response to complaints from hypno space citizens or leads from the
[1222.23s -> 1228.79s]  hypno space security team. Once a violation has been found, the offending citizen's name will be
[1228.79s -> 1233.99s]  listed here. Click to jump to the page to the where the violation was removed from.
[1234.79s -> 1240.71s]  Once all reported violations have been found in a case, you may close it by clicking the close
[1240.71s -> 1247.43s]  case button. Upon closing a case, you will earn a bonus payout of five hypno coin per violation reported.
[1247.43s -> 1255.35s]  Bitco coins, bitco coins, all right. So this is the main important portion of the okay let's think
[1255.35s -> 1260.79s]  about this. You get cases, you gotta investigate, you gotta get evidence, and then you get Bicno coins.
[1260.87s -> 1270.87s]  Got it. So let's look at the end box cases. We did this already. Investigating citizens. Here we go.
[1270.87s -> 1275.35s]  The version of hypno space explorer you'll be using has been modified with an expanded search feature
[1275.99s -> 1280.31s]  enabling you to find unlisted pages by searching for the tags that they contain.
[1280.31s -> 1287.13s]  Search illegal. Good time scam watch. Bad citizen McGee's page. Bad citizens. Yeah I'm bad. So
[1287.93s -> 1293.34s]  don't you know anything about being illegal? Why would you put illegal content in the
[1293.34s -> 1300.41s]  metadata tags of your website? View the stamped page list to revisit your stamped pages.
[1302.22s -> 1309.93s]  Okay. So you can search. You can find unlisted pages by searching for the tags that they contain.
[1310.65s -> 1315.05s]  Use the stamp system to keep track of which pages you visited. So that's the stamp right there.
[1315.05s -> 1322.86s]  Like stamp it. To view the stamp page let's click view list or control L. Okay control L is probably
[1322.94s -> 1329.90s]  a little easier. Or maybe not. View list. Hypno space's citizens place the pages they've built
[1329.90s -> 1336.22s]  in our themed zone communities. You will be given search and browsing access to zones only
[1336.22s -> 1340.46s]  if you've been assigned them by a dispatch agent. I can't just go rob us the internet? Your assigned
[1340.46s -> 1347.42s]  zones will be listed in the HSPD zone access hub. To return to the zone access hub at any time,
[1347.42s -> 1359.94s]  click this icon or use this keyboard shortcut. I'm bad so what? Okay so you'll be given search
[1359.94s -> 1364.66s]  and browsing access to zones only if you've been assigned them. Your assigned zones will be listed
[1364.66s -> 1372.82s]  in the HSPD zone access hub. Access hub right. Click the home icon and press control H. The
[1372.82s -> 1379.62s]  citizen data dialogue will show a citizen's name, age, place of residence, as well as the unique
[1380.10s -> 1386.90s]  number for the hypno space headband unit they're using. This information is only visible to HSPD
[1386.90s -> 1393.30s]  enforcers or hypno space security team members and may not be shared. Access the citizen data
[1393.30s -> 1399.14s]  dialogue by clicking this button in hypno space explorer. That's weird. This button next to the
[1399.14s -> 1409.78s]  message sender in your inbox or here in the file manager. Okay there's a lot of info. Citizen data
[1409.78s -> 1414.50s]  dialogue will show a citizen's name, age, place of residence, as well as a unique ID number for
[1414.50s -> 1425.37s]  the hypno space headband unit they're using. So this is virtual reality? Back in the 90s?
[1425.37s -> 1431.53s]  Don't be loud. I'm gonna hurt myself. Access the citizen data dialogue. Okay listen listen.
[1431.53s -> 1437.42s]  All right I had a migraine a couple days ago and it's fucking with me. So there you go. All right
[1437.42s -> 1442.22s]  access the citizen data dialogue by clicking the button to your upper right in the hypno space
[1442.22s -> 1447.24s]  explorer next to the from name in your inbox or the bottom of the file manager. Okay I'm gonna say
[1447.24s -> 1451.80s]  enforcement tools. Here we go version of hypno space explorer has also been modified to include
[1451.80s -> 1457.88s]  an enforcement tool. If you spot text or images that appear to be in violation of time, first

[6241.98s -> 6252.95s]  is i don't think the squisher is deception uh-oh well her princess in the midst thereof are like
[6252.95s -> 6259.11s]  wolves ravening the prey to shed blood and destroy souls to dishonest gain ezekiel
[6259.91s -> 6266.86s]  the wolf of squisher z the bible warns about woes many times it's a streamer
[6268.34s -> 6276.33s]  that's a twitch name that hat that's that's like a top 500 fortnight player has to be
[6279.54s -> 6286.84s]  and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and satan and bound him a
[6286.84s -> 6294.84s]  thousand years revelation all right that thing's zooming how much more convincing do you need a
[6294.84s -> 6299.96s]  serpent for kids to play with if you need more evidence let's look at his eyes for a moment
[6300.92s -> 6315.54s]  what is this i don't understand what this is a picture of a squisher z's it's like a cartoon
[6315.54s -> 6321.11s]  or something the snake's eye very clearly drawn to look like the egyptian third eye
[6323.51s -> 6329.11s]  the eye of chorus this eye supposedly grants its viewer sight that transcends good and evil
[6329.99s -> 6336.10s]  meaning the snake is teaching our kids that good and evil do not exist who else tried to erase
[6336.10s -> 6342.95s]  good and evil i'll give you a hint satan did in the garden in his serpent form then the serpent
[6342.95s -> 6349.35s]  said to the woman you will not surely die for god knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will
[6349.35s -> 6358.07s]  be opened and you'll be like god knowing good and evil that's from genesis three four six and
[6358.07s -> 6366.86s]  we're not through yet let's take a closer look at this popular giraffe squisher there's no way
[6366.86s -> 6370.54s]  this funny looking creature can carry a hidden message can it i'll let you see for yourselves
[6372.86s -> 6378.94s]  not so cute anymore is it nope it is not

[6388.78s -> 6394.38s]  toys how did this happen when a generation grows up without the lord what do you expect
[6395.32s -> 6401.80s]  we were so busy having nice little pageants and school plays that we forgot god now this rebellious
[6401.80s -> 6408.28s]  generation is in charge and we're reaping what we have sown these people make the popular cartoons
[6408.28s -> 6414.92s]  and movies and design the toys for our children and grandchildren if you think these people have
[6414.92s -> 6420.62s]  your kids best interest at heart think again at best they are unwitting servants of satan
[6420.62s -> 6426.22s]  at worst they are card carrying members of the cult there's a lot more where this came from we're
[6426.22s -> 6435.77s]  just getting started okay well you kind of go squisher z we're gonna have to remember that

[14212.10s -> 14215.78s]  community leader for good time valley even though i don't know why they picked me i think it's
[14215.78s -> 14220.02s]  because i have good behavior but that's because i don't ever use hypnospace other than for listening
[14220.02s -> 14227.94s]  to songs haha if you are having trouble you can contact me but i am sometimes busy and i'm also
[14227.94s -> 14243.19s]  not on hypnospace every night well bye okay good citizen this is mavis's page i've updated my page

[14335.86s -> 14346.50s]  obsessed with the gooper thing hello my loves please don't take this as me being against you all
[14346.58s -> 14349.86s]  but i think we should not be putting the gumshoe gooper cartoons on our page it
[14350.50s -> 14356.81s]  if we brig's estate doesn't want us to it doesn't seem like merchant soft are lying about this one
[14356.81s -> 14367.58s]  beef brain is a hoax click here to go to my humor picture gallery yeah we already saw these gumshoe
[14367.58s -> 14381.48s]  gooper was on here anymore beef brain is a hoax stop falling for these obvious tricks hello friends
[14381.48s -> 14386.44s]  i understand that some of you are concerned that hypnospace can hurt your brain and who knows maybe
[14386.44s -> 14391.40s]  it can but i have to say that this beef brain thing is very suspicious if you look at the bottom
[14391.40s -> 14397.43s]  of the beef brain main page it says something about minks if i remember right these are the
[14397.43s -> 14402.47s]  same hooligans who pulled the explosive headband prank and then half of you put that horrible
[14402.47s -> 14409.02s]  horrible song on your page in order to prevent your head from blowing up if the hypnospace
[14409.02s -> 14414.95s]  headband is unhealthy it's probably just because it makes you tired and not some crazy brain
[14416.78s -> 14430.90s]  love sandy okay sandy the dumpster the dumpster page should be shut down i don't know how they
[14430.90s -> 14435.16s]  get away with tearing people down all the time arlen your artwork is awesome don't listen to
[14435.16s -> 14440.62s]  these spoiled punks who wouldn't know good art if it bit them in the behind if they were any good
[14440.62s -> 14464.76s]  they wouldn't hide their page like slimy cowards we're going the dumpster taking out hypnospace's
[14464.76s -> 14478.14s]  trash so you don't have to previous dumpings i went to cool fest 99 this event was incredible
[14478.14s -> 14483.74s]  cool punk is finally dead folks and cool fest killed it from the moment i stepped out of my
[14483.74s -> 14489.53s]  car onto the ironically scorching pavement of the king amphitheater parking lot i knew this was
[14489.53s -> 14497.56s]  going to be special germa lied about minecraft vr thanks to five community subs again your
[14497.56s -> 14507.35s]  username is going to be pretty pretty irrelevant in like a week when i play minecraft vr but thank
[14507.35s -> 14515.54s]  you so much for your five subs okay hold on sandwich between two enormous ads for extra
[14515.54s -> 14520.58s]  thick chips was the cool fest ticket window waiting patiently in front of where 200 people
[14520.58s -> 14525.06s]  not quite the 5 000 person turnout the cool fest plan as we're hoping for here's a highly
[14525.06s -> 14532.92s]  scientific pie chart of the attendee types confused 45 year old chowder man fans 15
[14532.92s -> 14541.66s]  year old cool punk kids and parents of 15 year old cool punk kids is this a fire festival
[14541.66s -> 14548.07s]  jab here after grabbing our tickets a venue attendant had us from another line at the
[14548.07s -> 14553.99s]  opposite end of the venue for our promised joeman merch only the cool punk kids and parents hit
[14553.99s -> 14559.40s]  this line with the chowder man people heading inside to get good seats for his opening act
[14559.40s -> 14564.68s]  after waiting for nearly an hour for the merch to show up the sound of tires screeching called
[14564.68s -> 14570.25s]  our attention to a truck speeding towards us knocking a few trash cans over on the way
[14570.25s -> 14577.13s]  some sweaty guy emerged with a single box of joeman keychains no shirts and no free grace
[14578.09s -> 14584.41s]  as promised people were pissed and the keychains were used as projectiles throughout the rest of
[14584.41s -> 14593.93s]  the evening chowder man had already launched into the chowder man's hotel room let's get some
[14593.93s -> 14631.59s]  what did i download where's uh where's chowder man there we go found it to be appropriate
[14631.59s -> 14635.94s]  chowder man had already launched into the chowder man's hotel room when me and the
[14635.94s -> 14640.74s]  gaggle of cool punk kids and parents arrived at the stage he followed it up with some eight
[14640.74s -> 14645.86s]  minute song about shaving a couple of newer rap rock songs with his new band cruncher
[14645.86s -> 14651.38s]  and an encore of an extended version of the greys peak jingle no one really cared or seemed
[14651.38s -> 14657.46s]  particularly into the stuff until the greys peak thing then it happened a helicopter landed on a
[14657.46s -> 14666.34s]  platform in the middle of the crowd and the band ate and a few the band and a few fans from that
[14666.42s -> 14672.50s]  stage hopped aboard i was surprised that the thing even made it safely with all the wires hanging
[14672.50s -> 14678.98s]  around as i'm sure you all know chowder man crashed his copter old chowder's leg had to be
[14678.98s -> 14683.62s]  amputated and their drummer died i can't bring myself to be awful about this because it was
[14683.62s -> 14689.98s]  harrowing to watch do you think they'd call it a night after a helicopter crash but no cool fest
[14689.98s -> 14696.14s]  continued an old guy from greys peak a guy in a joeman costume and a few merchant saw people
[14696.14s -> 14700.62s]  came up and gave a speech about how amazing and dedicated cool punk fans are and threw a
[14700.62s -> 14707.42s]  few shirts into the crowd it would have been weird anyway but the crash just made it completely
[14707.42s -> 14714.06s]  surreal to watch freezer hit the stage next and played for only 15 minutes before it became clear
[14714.06s -> 14720.14s]  that he was lip syncing the cool punk kids started yelling mild swear words and started throwing
[14720.14s -> 14725.50s]  their joeman key change on stage an old guy came out and told everyone that cool fest was over
[14726.14s -> 14730.94s]  and that was it needless to say the event exceeded my expectations
[14744.44s -> 14749.98s]  well that was fucking rude that was very well written too that's a very good comedy write-up
[14749.98s -> 14764.12s]  right there all right so the dumpster i want to cool fester it is too popular now currently
[14764.12s -> 14768.36s]  filling the void the ditch exchange left behind after merchants off banned it until recently
[14768.36s -> 14774.04s]  people were only using it to post rips of the bad obscure music they listen to but now the hypnospace
[14774.04s -> 14781.02s]  ravel is sharing passwords i guess and it's getting really really bizarre oh like do these
[14781.02s -> 14788.44s]  people get that it's private here are a bunch of interesting poems this is a password these are
[14788.44s -> 14797.35s]  passwords drawings of cars with human heads even chowder man himself is using it and well just see
[14797.35s -> 14808.74s]  for yourself this is a password we should probably revoke all flissed passwords and start again at
[14808.74s -> 14813.78s]  least they don't know about the net settler safe mode thing yet nobody tell them please
[14817.43s -> 14823.11s]  safe mode net settler safe do i have net settler what is this now that's hypno cure
[14828.20s -> 14839.58s]  all right so f 00088 d somebody write that down right everybody somebody everybody write these
[14839.58s -> 14852.07s]  down the free lands are amazing taking out hypnospace is trash okay this group of geeks
[14852.07s -> 14855.75s]  staged an insurrection after merchants off deleted their favorite zones and i legitimately
[14855.75s -> 14862.81s]  like what they're done it's dumb as hell but i love it instead of a list of pages you have
[14862.81s -> 14868.57s]  to navigate their zone by clicking arrows on a giant multi-page map and click on landmarks to
[14868.57s -> 14875.91s]  visit their pages it takes ages to find what you're looking for i have sticky notes maybe
[14875.91s -> 14884.18s]  you guys already wrote down look the only thing i have my only sticky note is from the first 10
[14884.18s -> 14893.86s]  minutes of the game all right what are they you guys are gonna fuck with me here so i'm just
[14893.86s -> 14914.42s]  gonna get it myself all right f1 f10427a f10427a f10427a f15997a fuck no f15 what was it oh god

[14959.06s -> 14964.74s]  exchange stopped talking behind after merchants soft bandit stop talking recently people were
[14964.74s -> 14968.82s]  only using it to post rips of the bad obscure music they were just gonna wait till he's done
[14968.82s -> 14973.46s]  but now the hypnospace ravel are sharing passwords i guess and it's getting really
[14973.86s -> 14986.90s]  here's a twitch tts donation do these people okay complaining about zones that a merchant
[14986.90s -> 14991.70s]  soft employee is partially responsible for its existence he disabled the page owner field on
[14991.70s -> 14996.34s]  the freelance page so technically anyone who knows about it can get in and make changes
[14998.17s -> 15008.74s]  really he just disabled the page owner field i did a little tinkering yeah added a dong shape
[15008.74s -> 15012.74s]  but my edits were changed back minutes later so there must be some nerd out there keeping a really
[15012.74s -> 15023.48s]  close eye on this stuff let me don oh he put a dick on it okay i get it all right so the home
[15023.48s -> 15033.91s]  page can be edited and then visit the archive 1999 halloween and hypnospace world's worst hsm
[15033.91s -> 15041.14s]  shutdown designed by non-musicians to save bandwidth by triggering samples that come

[15049.80s -> 15055.72s]  package for flaming os the accessibility of the software has resulted in a plague of unlistenable
[15055.72s -> 15061.56s]  trash music from amateur composers the world over please put your ears together for the world's
[15061.56s -> 15075.93s]  worst hsm showdown this is pizza dance pizza dance so this is the pizza dance song we already have
[15075.93s -> 15080.73s]  this we've done a little it's like five times underscores massively kill cybercog circus
[15080.73s -> 15086.49s]  kill cybercog circus result of a give a monkey hypnospace tune sequencer experiment
[15087.29s -> 15093.35s]  now let's see how bad they are pizza dance

[24045.86s -> 24052.34s]  special about hypnospace it felt like a livid in place that folks out there trying to preserve its
[24052.34s -> 24061.32s]  history inspires me greatly sorry about the old picture did you use a hypnospace in 98.99 it sure
[24061.32s -> 24068.14s]  did if so did you do anything embarrassing i'm not so sure it's been ages from my age at the time it
[24068.14s -> 24074.14s]  was highly probable young tamara didn't know where to take her life she was an autumn leaf blown
[24074.14s -> 24079.26s]  every which way by people in social movements and her own creative whims what are you up to now
[24079.98s -> 24086.78s]  i'm a poet for children i wrote a few anthologies that kids your kids have probably seen at their
[24086.78s -> 24097.06s]  school library between the angry spaces and river river river river how's chowder man doing okay
[24097.54s -> 24111.59s]  interesting uh okay let's see i have tim's page tim stevens profile there he is it is not an

[24128.82s -> 24133.94s]  about back in 2000 yes i went to prison and yes i spent the whole six years there i'm much different
[24133.94s -> 24141.48s]  now as anyone is after adolescence i did use hyper hypno space in 98 you do anything embarrassing
[24142.04s -> 24145.32s]  i'm not really sure how to answer this one embarrassing is not the right word for what i
[24145.32s -> 24153.40s]  caused i still think about it every day and i'm deeply deeply sorry for it i was a kid missing
[24153.40s -> 24159.16s]  around with tech that i knew almost nothing about my entire world revolved around wooing a girl
[24159.80s -> 24165.48s]  i was infatuated with and getting into a hacker group and i would have done anything to impress
[24165.48s -> 24170.65s]  either of them i had no idea that i'd even be capable of harming people with the software i'd
[24170.65s -> 24180.60s]  made it was all so so stupid i now work in computer security and live a contended contented life with
[24180.60s -> 24198.30s]  my wife and daughter okay uh we have chelsea chelsea's page i'm chelsea the h.a.p. co-lead along

[24203.61s -> 24207.45s]  it's unlikely that anyone remembers me since i never made my own hypnosis page i used chit chat
[24207.45s -> 24214.79s]  but hypnosis was a very important part of my life uh this whole project was my idea thankfully
[24214.79s -> 24221.46s]  tomorrow was interested enough to help foot the bill i did use it do anything embarrassing nope
[24221.46s -> 24226.78s]  if i ever got around to making a page i wouldn't have plenty i'd have plenty to share okay not a
[24226.78s -> 24230.86s]  whole lot really just working a boring office job and reminiscing about hypnosis in my off time
[24230.86s -> 24242.79s]  can't wait to see what we're able to dig up only a couple more arty arty dispenses profile time
[24242.79s -> 24254.34s]  flow flow time steaming gone gone gone gone okay did you use hypno space hypno space did we really
[24254.34s -> 24260.82s]  use it or did it use us if so did you do anything embarrassing embarrassment is shame humiliation
[24260.82s -> 24268.71s]  is hurt embarrassment is not me not us what are you up to now lover designer giver reader of hope

[24275.75s -> 24289.13s]  because that's where it belongs okay and a lot this is where we post requests for things
[24289.13s -> 24294.86s]  that we're trying to find in the old hypno space backups help us locate them you've laughed at every
[24294.86s -> 24304.23s]  fart i have not laughed at every single part absolutely not i got no way can you mute your
[24304.23s -> 24312.70s]  mic i have not laughed at every single one you bring me documented proof i did not i i know i
[24312.70s -> 24321.13s]  did not bullshit i don't believe it here's where we'll list the things that we believe may exist
[24321.13s -> 24326.97s]  only in hypno space and would otherwise be lost to time all you need to do is view the page that
[24326.97s -> 24333.30s]  these things exist on and they'll be sent to us and archived okay please do your best to find them
[24333.30s -> 24341.69s]  germa as your headband backups may be our last hope okay look the chowder man song okay found
[24341.69s -> 24348.14s]  one adrian wanted to know if you dig up a song that the chowder man wrote about his helicopter
[24348.14s -> 24355.48s]  accident i got that one yeah this is something i'm missing close friend of mine and famous rap star
[24355.48s -> 24360.76s]  remembers putting his music on hypno space when he was in his early 20s but never really getting
[24360.76s -> 24366.15s]  any attention all he remembers is that some guy deleted him from a listing saying that his music
[24366.15s -> 24371.91s]  wasn't real music because it was flip-flop and that he should do something more imaginative
[24372.63s -> 24380.52s]  i found him this would be a huge deal uh roddy's early test pet i'm almost certain that roddy made
[24380.52s -> 24386.20s]  an odd looking test pet early in november that looked like that comic book floating eye he
[24386.20s -> 24393.88s]  always talked about would love to play with it again weird secret eye cult all kinds of
[24393.88s -> 24398.52s]  pages with a strange encryption eye on them if my memory serves i'm pretty sure even adrian
[24398.52s -> 24405.45s]  merchant had that symbol somewhere can you find out what that's all about missing person demetri
[24405.45s -> 24410.17s]  jackson the daughter and ex-wife of a demetri jackson have contacted us requesting any information
[24410.17s -> 24428.58s]  we can find what may have happened to cause his disappearance in 1999 no i'm laughing now because
[24428.58s -> 24432.42s]  i'm trying not to laugh because i know that people think i'm laughing at it
[24442.26s -> 24445.62s]  all they know is that he was using hypno space frequently at the time and was communicating
[24445.62s -> 24449.70s]  frequently with a rich guy who was going to help him fund some sort of sea voyage
[24451.29s -> 24475.54s]  what that's me i killed him i what no i didn't i caused him to die no let me check my emails
[24478.65s -> 24489.70s]  you found the chowder of antoine yep welcome to the archive project i knew there had to be
[24489.70s -> 24498.84s]  someone out there with a working enforce it there is no mail can i just so yeah this is the
[24500.04s -> 24504.49s]  i mean if you form a hypno space users formed a ragtag group to preserve content from the
[24504.49s -> 24510.33s]  services late 1990 period just before the crash we've been unable to find anyone involved with
[24510.33s -> 24515.93s]  merchant soft outside of arty which is a story in itself and we're pretty certain that the backup
[24515.93s -> 24520.65s]  servers are long gone after merchant soft got raided you represent the first major breakthrough
[24520.65s -> 24525.37s]  we've had towards preserving a piece of history that would otherwise be lost please check out
[24525.37s -> 24530.49s]  the lost and found page on our intranet and help us track down a few of those things there
[24532.60s -> 24537.16s]  enforcer headband units had an entire gigabyte of internal disk space our best guess is that
[24537.16s -> 24543.72s]  enforcer units doubled as many backup servers which conveniently wasn't told to the unpaid
[24543.72s -> 24548.76s]  moderators who might have scrapped them for parts we coded a little program to help you
[24549.48s -> 24552.92s]  help us extract the data accessible in your headband and upload it to us
[24553.64s -> 24559.24s]  download and install the attached program to get started we're all really excited to see what you

[28199.10s -> 28203.90s]  more gain than an attack really on hypnospace tonight and it's entirely meaningless it's
[28203.90s -> 28210.14s]  completely overshadowing my leak and people really need to see this i wish he'd stop it
[28210.14s -> 28215.26s]  with the theatrics because this could hurt people if anything happens to my leak i'm putting a backup
[28215.26s -> 28233.46s]  on my island in scdfl scdfl that's freelance so that's reckoning inc with a backup in freelance

[29185.42s -> 29193.93s]  lot not my point the doc said that look don't worry about it if people are tired after sleep time
[29193.93s -> 29199.05s]  just get on fewer nights per week people are responsible for their own choices too much ice
[29199.05s -> 29204.95s]  cream will kill you but no one does studies on that yeah hypnospace is like ice cream it's good
[29207.75s -> 29214.15s]  it's we who don't get sleep with these long streams this i know we're late we're late again

[31421.61s -> 31447.74s]  i'm sorry zane that was a backhanded compliment it's like i got one dollar what am i gonna spend
[31447.74s -> 31456.49s]  it on it turns out i didn't even like need these now but even after you're done there's still a
[31456.49s -> 31465.58s]  bunch of pages that i didn't really see that i skipped skim through you could probably spend
[31465.58s -> 31478.20s]  another there's at least probably another two or three hours of time at least to go through bwl
[31478.20s -> 31487.00s]  burst out laughing right play janitor for the next six hours no no no no uh that was a lot of
[31487.00s -> 31494.81s]  fun thanks for joining me i'll see you guys tomorrow tomorrow there's one of two options here
[31495.45s -> 31503.93s]  either we're gonna do space channel five or or uh then get a new game that came out on steam
[31503.93s -> 31509.05s]  that's co-op it's like a co-op story shooter called like was it rico i think it's called
[31509.69s -> 31518.79s]  space channel five is only like a couple hours long so i probably i need to put that somewhere
[31518.79s -> 31524.81s]  where that is the beginning or the end of the stream i'm actually really happy that i was able
[31524.81s -> 31529.58s]  to stay on for this long because before i turned the stream on i was sitting here thinking maybe
[31529.58s -> 31537.69s]  i'm not gonna peel the stream from within a couple hours but i feel okay so late tonight i know
[31537.69s -> 31546.50s]  thanks there was still a shit little people here all the way into like two three a.m eastern so
[31546.50s -> 31552.57s]  appreciate it i'm not gonna do vr for a little while until i'm not sure if anybody
[31553.37s -> 31559.85s]  how many of you guys were here at the beginning of the stream but i had a a massive catastrophic
[31559.85s -> 31567.45s]  exorcist like migraine there a few days ago and it shut me off for two straight days it fucked me
[31567.45s -> 31578.28s]  up bad so i'm kind of taking it easy i'm just happy i was didn't have a problem streaming today
[31578.28s -> 31588.34s]  so that means i'll probably be fine tomorrow actual beef brain yeah imagine getting irl beef
[31588.34s -> 31594.98s]  brain and then playing this game on accident what did i say blend up my brain and like piss on it
[31594.98s -> 31600.70s]  or something something like that well i'll see you tomorrow if you're coming we're going to do the
[31600.70s -> 31607.22s]  bits and the credits right at the end here i got a stamp of approval on this game this game was a
[31607.22s -> 31619.38s]  lot of fun and they were developers here and that's that's really cool you made an interesting uh
[31619.38s -> 31630.41s]  piece here so nice work let's see log off how much in-game time was it uh zero 21a
[31631.21s -> 31640.82s]  oh no that's a.m let's close that out and hey what do you know here comes the outro
[31644.94s -> 31649.66s]  i don't think we have two this bits aren't gonna take too long i don't think no this should be
[31650.22s -> 31659.62s]  maybe like 30 40 minutes all right let's start thank you to bake me home for the 250 get some
[31659.62s -> 31665.96s]  rest you little man i will i'll be good to go for tomorrow whatever it may be the space channel or

[31672.22s -> 31680.10s]  healthy for the next 300 years doctors hate me i wish it were that easy i wish it were that easy
[31680.74s -> 31685.70s]  but thank you uh foury thank you foury for the three bucks hey germa i was wondering if you
[31685.70s -> 31690.50s]  could do a movie night like star where you watched old videos with chat and gave behind the scenes
[31690.50s -> 31698.42s]  perspectives this stream is very relaxed trip down memory lane we've done some stuff like that before
[31698.42s -> 31706.41s]  before we sat there and watched random videos not as an entire stream though um
[31709.27s -> 31725.38s]  probably not maybe maybe maybe not for an entire stream i could do that for like an hour or so
[31725.38s -> 31729.22s]  just old videos that i maybe i'd want to re-watch or haven't seen in a long time
[31730.02s -> 31736.06s]  it's an interesting idea though you get carried away yeah you sit there for like six hours
[31738.25s -> 31741.69s]  star actually made a new video if you don't know star made a new basically video
[31742.33s -> 31754.10s]  just three years later it's just like bang here's another one uh it's pretty funny it's pretty fun
[31754.66s -> 31762.54s]  you'd probably like it imagine not uploading the same year as stars i don't have any plans
[31762.54s -> 31773.82s]  for any videos it was good but thank you for even three bucks and not immediately hey trust
[31773.82s -> 31779.26s]  no one thanks for the 250 hey germa good uh good you're in a better state now but during my long
[31779.34s -> 31783.50s]  ride through your archive streams i stumbled upon several occasions of you saying something
[31783.50s -> 31788.54s]  particular but most of it turned out to be something different later to be more precise
[31788.54s -> 31795.10s]  lies lots of lies i've collected some examples just to reveal the truth to chat i have to bring
[31795.10s -> 31801.18s]  this message to the people they must know justice must be served please don't be mad god damn it
[31801.82s -> 31805.74s]  you're gonna pull out everything i've ever said that wasn't true this is gonna be embarrassing

[33106.81s -> 33110.73s]  no bits old man i've said about a thousand times but i really enjoy the fact that you regularly
[33110.73s -> 33115.61s]  stream for something like six hours or more and on that note do you ever get sick of streaming
[33115.61s -> 33119.61s]  or feel like you just don't want to play anything would you feel like playing a certain game that
[33119.61s -> 33131.78s]  you already streamed and don't because of it um no you gotta remember i i don't stream like a lot
[33131.78s -> 33140.25s]  of other people stream i stream four days a week sometime you know three or four days a week
[33141.19s -> 33145.83s]  i don't go hard every day i don't have the kind of the same game or the same content that i like
[33145.83s -> 33155.05s]  to do so i have time to not be streaming you know and have a life outside of streaming and
[33155.69s -> 33163.77s]  do other things and see other things and try to work on myself in the quotes right but i
[33163.77s -> 33169.13s]  don't ever feel like ah god here we go just gotta get your face on
[33169.93s -> 33176.39s]  huh huh huh fuck i don't want to fucking be here hey guys what's up man uh here we go it is time
[33176.39s -> 33185.83s]  for stream welcome everybody it's saturday because whenever i stream it's when i want to
[33185.83s -> 33197.18s]  and that goes with why did you get rid of the schedule because that's able to happen but i
[33197.18s -> 33203.66s]  i had the same exact mindset when i did youtube was i'm gonna do it when i know i want to and
[33203.66s -> 33208.95s]  when i know i can when i know that i want to put myself forward and have a level of energy and
[33208.95s -> 33212.95s]  know that i want to do something have something i would like to do and if i don't know what i'm
[33212.95s -> 33216.47s]  gonna do for a couple days in a row and i spend some time trying to figure that out then i'm not
[33216.47s -> 33223.35s]  gonna stream it's been like that since youtube i sometimes i didn't make a video for like five
[33223.35s -> 33226.87s]  or six straight days because it was like ah whatever let me figure out what i want to do
[33234.58s -> 33244.33s]  and i am forever grateful that there are a shitload of people on the internet that are that are okay
[33244.33s -> 33254.89s]  with that and think that that's interesting and like the stuff that's here you know i take that
[33254.89s -> 33268.98s]  incredibly seriously i take it very seriously so that long-windedly maybe opened um not opened
[33268.98s -> 33277.72s]  maybe that closed that question for you maybe but long story short when you see a stream turn on
[33277.72s -> 33284.28s]  it's because i wanted to turn it on and if a stream does not turn on it's because i didn't want to do
[33284.28s -> 33289.56s]  it for some reason either i wanted to break i wanted a day off i had something i wanted to do
[33290.20s -> 33296.92s]  i had the other year in real life shit i wanted to do so every time you see the stream turn on i
[33296.92s -> 33302.42s]  want to fucking be here it's part of the design so thank you so much for the incredibly
[33303.46s -> 33312.26s]  uh wonderful continued support and thanks with three bucks thank you fraudy and weapon for the
