[8.50s -> 18.36s]  I am back. So we got, I don't know, yeah, which, maybe you guys can help me and go over which
[18.36s -> 28.23s]  one of these are any good. Because I really, I have no idea. I just got keys for random cases
[28.23s -> 34.49s]  that I still had in my inventory and I, you might look at this and go, holy shit, this guy's stupid.
[34.49s -> 43.11s]  He got keys for the winter 2018 case. I just, I don't know, I didn't want to give, I wanted
[43.11s -> 48.62s]  just to open them. That's the good one. No, that's the good one. That's the good one. Well, we'll
[48.62s -> 67.02s]  find out. Okay, you should be able to see it very shortly. Okay, here we go. You ready? So what,
[67.02s -> 75.05s]  what's, what do you think? What do you think? I got 25 cases to open. How are these? Are these
[75.05s -> 91.34s]  all right? This is Blue Moon, Tough Break, Rainy Day, Abominable, Scream Fortress. Is that 12?
[91.90s -> 101.75s]  Winter 2018, Winter 2020, Summer 2023, obviously. That's the, these are the new ones right here.
[101.75s -> 111.19s]  These four are for this update. Winter 2020. That's a lot of winter and a lot of Scream Fortress,
[111.19s -> 120.09s]  Jungle Jackpot, Eternal Reward. All right, we just, we're just gonna go? Facecam? No, no, no,
[120.09s -> 128.31s]  no facecam. Just imagine what I look like right now. You get scammed, scammed. Will he unbox at
[128.31s -> 141.38s]  least one strange item? I kind of feel like that's gonna happen. Okay, you ready? Let's just start at
[141.38s -> 146.81s]  the top. I made it nice and clear. By the way, this is what I was talking about. This is just
[146.81s -> 150.97s]  all the Scout primaries, all the Scout secondaries, all the Scout melees.
[150.97s -> 162.20s]  I like them to be some separation here. By quality. Notice how this is by quality.
[162.20s -> 173.08s]  Soldier, right? That's a Minimal Wear. What are my best items? Let me see. It's Factory New.
[174.60s -> 180.90s]  I have, yeah, okay. I've got, this is a Factory New Warhawk Flamethrower. This thing is pretty
[180.90s -> 190.78s]  sick. Nice organization. Yeah, oh yeah. I have a really good sniper rifle too, or is it? Yeah,
[190.78s -> 197.05s]  I got a Purple Range Factory New. Cool. I also have a field-tested one. Why do I still have this?
[197.05s -> 202.36s]  I don't know. Where's the skip button to the unboxing? Okay, all right, all right, all right.
[202.36s -> 212.54s]  All right, Blue Moon. Let's see. Are we ready? Here we go. I could get any of these. We're looking
[212.54s -> 226.82s]  for the Robin Walkers. Why are people omega-lulling? Is this a bad one? Let's go. Oh, I got an Assassin's
[226.82s -> 241.69s]  attire. Nothing else. Oh, a free ticket! I don't want to do this anymore. I think I'm done. That
[241.69s -> 253.59s]  was all right. Cool. Wait, let's look at it. Okay, I put the gibbous on because I didn't want people
[253.59s -> 260.71s]  to be mad that I was a bad spy player. I forgot. All right, I put this on to like hide because I
[260.71s -> 264.31s]  didn't want people to, because if you're in like full cosmetics, if you're like decked out a bunch
[264.31s -> 270.18s]  of crazy shit, people are like, oh, that's, look at all this cool stuff the spy has. I put the gibbous
[270.18s -> 272.82s]  on because I want people to go like, oh, that's like, I don't know, that he might have been playing
[272.82s -> 292.65s]  for very long. All right, let's put it on. Ooh, I like it. Cool. Okay, cool. Let's do it again.
[298.49s -> 308.49s]  I got two items again. What is it? Sky high fly guy and a backpack expander. That's cool. Those
[308.49s -> 314.87s]  are like worth, aren't these like five bucks? These things are like five or six bucks, aren't they?
[319.02s -> 327.45s]  LOL, no. No, no, no. They're a dollar. They're like five cents. Oh, okay. Well, that's cool.
[330.39s -> 345.45s]  Yeah, I already have. I don't really need to use this. Who's this for? Soldier. I like it. Cool.
[348.10s -> 358.09s]  I'm gonna keep it on. We're gonna be here all day? No, we're not. Let's do it again.
[358.09s -> 366.44s]  What's the good thing from this? This is the last chance. Oh, it's another blue. I freaking
[366.44s -> 373.38s]  love gambling. I kind of just want the cosmetics, if I'm honest, because I've given my backpack away
[373.38s -> 379.00s]  like three times over the last 10 years, so I don't really have very many like cosmetic items.
[379.00s -> 387.58s]  I kind of want to like just get some more. This is heavy, obviously, right? I mean, I don't think I
[387.58s -> 396.95s]  can take off the parted wig. That's just not going to happen. I got a genuine pounding father, by the
[396.95s -> 416.02s]  way. Jealous. I like it. It's two jackets. One of them is just ripping through the other one. I like
[416.02s -> 422.86s]  it. It looks like I don't know what I'm doing. That's perfect. Two jacket Andy. Yeah, I'm keeping
[422.86s -> 431.78s]  it. All right, now that's all those. So those are gone. Tough break. We're looking for a well-wrapped
[431.78s -> 448.60s]  hat. Okay, let's go. What's that? Ooh, what's that? Is that good? Should I even care? Winter backup?
[449.16s -> 461.82s]  What was that? Was it good? It's an engineer item. I love the engineer stuff.
[461.82s -> 472.86s]  Uh, where is it? That's kind of a rare one. I like it, but I wish I want the hair still. That's not
[472.86s -> 484.09s]  the worst thing you get. Yeah, it's pretty neat. I like it. I'm not taking the level three chin off,
[484.09s -> 493.80s]  though. Or the stomach. It's important. Good. This is exactly what I wanted. I wanted just to get
[493.80s -> 498.81s]  items to put on to wear because I want to be able to have different outfits. All right, so what
[498.81s -> 505.67s]  about? Let me see. What else is in here? So that was a good one. That was winter backup. I could
[505.67s -> 522.20s]  inspect them, but I don't want to. I like to be surprised. Another backpack expander. Okay. But
[522.20s -> 528.95s]  what's the real item? Uh, ooh, this is another one. A bonk, batters, bat. So this is a backpack.
[528.95s -> 537.10s]  This is another kind of kind of rare one. That's cool. Let me see it. Oh shit, that's like one of
[537.10s -> 556.81s]  the better ones. Cool. This is not a bad drip for the scout. This kind of like hooded sweatshirt with
[556.81s -> 571.00s]  the bonk on the back and the sneakers. This is a pretty good outfit. I like this. I'm into it. Nice.
[571.00s -> 577.45s]  All right, one more of these. Also, I'm not, I'm probably not going to do this again. This is kind
[577.45s -> 582.01s]  of just like a one and done kind of deal. I just want to get some more cosmetics. So don't expect
[582.01s -> 589.24s]  like, oh yeah, I'm going to open like 50 cases every week. That's no, I just had a bunch of
[589.24s -> 592.68s]  inventory and I'm just kind of clearing it out and I was going to do it off stream, but it's like,
[592.68s -> 597.27s]  you know what? Why don't we just, why don't I just do it here? So this is probably not happening
[597.27s -> 606.04s]  again. Kappa, Kappa, Kappa. Well, it might happen at, so I don't know, but it's not like I'm not
[606.04s -> 619.29s]  just going to open cases. It's not a regular thing. It's a demo. Medic. I like the chef hat.
[622.98s -> 633.35s]  Oh, it's a, that's cool. Okay. I'll keep it. All right. I only have one of these. I have one rainy
[633.35s -> 645.50s]  day. So it better be good. You do not think that's cool. This is the best one. Rainy day is,
[646.14s -> 649.82s]  rainy day is best one. Actually, unironically, for real, people are saying this is like the
[649.82s -> 669.03s]  best one that I have. All right, here we go. What is that? That's cool. I like this one a lot. I'm
[669.03s -> 679.77s]  going to, I'm going to wear this right now. It's going to replace the gibbous. Oh, this, I can't
[679.77s -> 687.62s]  have the sunglasses on. It's perfect. All right. What else? Do I have anything else?
[698.04s -> 707.98s]  I don't know. That's not bad. Do it with the gibbous? No, I'm not putting the gibbous on with
[707.98s -> 723.75s]  this. I like this because it's got the microphone. All right. I'm keeping it. Okay. So I also have
[723.75s -> 734.89s]  one of these. Abominable cosmetic case. Drip or drop? I don't know. Explain the stream title.
[735.77s -> 739.21s]  A mod did it. I don't know. I cannot condone anything that the mods are doing right now. I have no
[739.21s -> 744.68s]  idea what it says. I can't even look over there because it's tabbed out. All right. What's in this
[744.68s -> 765.21s]  one? Let's get a red. Can you guys even hear it being opened? I'll take a Manco ticket. Why not?
[765.21s -> 776.87s]  Sniper? Barely. Eh, it's all right. That looks like a cool sniper hat. Kind of low on the tier
[776.87s -> 787.78s]  list, but see, I got a red already. The sniper outfit, I don't think can change. It's too good.
[788.26s -> 805.24s]  You know what I mean? I'm not sure I can take that off. It's too good. Skibbidi toilet looking
[805.24s -> 819.86s]  motherfucker. It works. I could put it on a different loadout. Yeah, look at this one. Skibbidi
[819.86s -> 830.07s]  toilet. Oh, come on. All right. This, we'll do the war paint after. I feel like that's, we do that
[830.07s -> 836.15s]  as a follow-up. We'll do the cosmetics first. All right. This is winter 2018. I was told that
[836.15s -> 841.86s]  don't do these because they're terrible. Well, it's too late. I already have four keys for it.
[841.86s -> 854.55s]  So we're just gonna, we'll get through it. This is winter 2018. I only have two of these. How is
[854.55s -> 864.79s]  that terrible? That's awesome. I have a little like engineer thing now. Are you serious? It's
[864.79s -> 875.75s]  for the pyro? By the way, imagine this motherfucker sitting in spawn AFK. This is the actual loadout
[875.75s -> 887.38s]  caught red handed. This is the loadout. This is it right here. This is my loadout caught red handed.
[887.38s -> 898.52s]  I love my pyro loadout. I think it looks great. I love the glasses, but that's cool too. Mosquito
[898.52s -> 911.98s]  face. Yeah. I painted it white. Yeah. That's funny. I'll keep it. Got one more of those. So
[911.98s -> 934.34s]  what's the good stuff? Dumbbell, millennial mercenary. I'm very curious about that. Breadheads. Oh wow.
[934.34s -> 944.38s]  And I got a festivizer. Uh, engineer's my favorite class too. So this is great. I'm glad to get this.
[944.38s -> 984.84s]  Well, I can't replace anything. Shit. It works. Cool. All right. I'm liking the NG stuff. All
[984.84s -> 990.97s]  right. Now we're going to teleport two years. This is winter 2020. I've never opened one of these.
[990.97s -> 1003.54s]  I don't have anything. Are you using the pompson? Cause a lot of items got changed and I was just
[1003.54s -> 1011.70s]  curious as to how much. All right. 2020. Give us something good. That's, that's pretty great.
[1012.82s -> 1022.17s]  I can wear those right now, right? Can I wear these right now? Who can wear these?
[1022.17s -> 1034.39s]  It's an all class. Oh God damn it. Oh damn it. Oh damn it. Okay. That's exactly what's going on.
[1034.39s -> 1053.32s]  I think this is a perfect loadout now. Put it on every class. Put it on the fat guy NG. Oh,
[1053.32s -> 1078.84s]  that's a good idea. Hold on. I need, I need to get rid of the helmet though. That's going to be so
[1078.84s -> 1084.98s]  annoying to every single person that plays the game with me. It looks awful. I think it looks
[1084.98s -> 1108.41s]  great. What about a blue, right? Ooh, cool. Yeah. I love it. Remove the tracker. Uh, I like it. Those
[1108.41s -> 1119.93s]  are all the way down. I would put those up at pink. Those are, that's a pink item. That's not a blue.
[1120.01s -> 1134.73s]  Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. It's perfect. And I can wear this all year. It's all class.
[1144.92s -> 1162.44s]  Am I going to really just be like the Christmas dickhead? I guess so.
[1162.44s -> 1183.90s]  Hey, Merry Christmas all year. Put it on the soldier. Yep. It works. It works pretty well,
[1183.90s -> 1222.90s]  especially because the Santa, um, the heavy would be great. Okay. Not bad. That's phenomenal. Just
[1222.90s -> 1228.98s]  put it on every single character and just be Christmas on every single character. All right.
[1228.98s -> 1237.06s]  Let's keep going. Uh, I'll do these last because these are, who cares? Should I just do them now?
[1237.06s -> 1246.50s]  This is this year. This is the cosmetics for right now. The patch. Should I just do them now? Do it
[1246.50s -> 1251.51s]  now? Do it last. All right. We'll do these both last cause this is also the Warpaint from this
[1251.51s -> 1262.28s]  update too. All right. With that being said, this is Scream Fortress. This is Warpaint now.
[1262.28s -> 1268.36s]  So Warpaint is the factory new minimum, a minimal wearer field tested, like you probably used to
[1268.36s -> 1278.31s]  being seen. They changed how this works. I kind of understand it now, but let's find out. So I
[1278.31s -> 1287.02s]  only, I don't have very many left, so let's go. I only have one of these. Oh, this is X. Let's go.
[1287.02s -> 1300.15s]  What is it? It's, it's really scuffed. It's one of the good ones, but it is fucking destroyed.
[1300.15s -> 1310.38s]  Dammit. Is that the worst one? Is that the worst quality? Field tested. Dammit. Uh, let's put it on
[1310.38s -> 1325.14s]  like something. So you can put this on any of these. That's really cool. And I think it randomizes.
[1325.14s -> 1331.54s]  It's a puke weapon. Yeah. What about the Ubersaw stuff looks really good on shotgun. You can't go
[1331.54s -> 1342.60s]  wrong either because so many people can use it. I mean, it is, it is a booger gun. What about the
[1342.60s -> 1354.02s]  mini gun? Mini gun always looks pretty cool. Too bad it's field tested. Field tested is the second
[1354.02s -> 1365.30s]  worst, right? Dammit. It's one of the good ones too. So it goes battle scarred field tested, um,
[1366.02s -> 1381.56s]  well-worn, minimal wear, factory new. I think that's correct. Let's do it again. Something good,
[1381.56s -> 1388.49s]  at least something with higher quality. Oh, look at how awesome that one is too. And it looks
[1388.49s -> 1407.08s]  all fucked up. Dammit. This could have been my favorite paint. Field tested. Dammit. Although it
[1407.08s -> 1412.78s]  is a Halloween kind of weapon, the scuffed in the blood actually kind of adds to it.
[1412.78s -> 1423.03s]  Trash this? I don't think it needs to be trashed. I kind of like it on the wrench.
[1423.59s -> 1439.66s]  So correct, from my understanding, when, when this is put on, it, it gives a random pattern of this
[1439.66s -> 1450.57s]  paint. So it's kind of just showing you what's even possible, right? I'm seeing a lot of nos.
[1450.57s -> 1461.11s]  You choose the pattern. Oh, somebody said, who cares? Yes, at the end of the day. That's right.
[1461.11s -> 1468.58s]  All right. This is winter 2020 paint. We got to cross our fingers here for this one because
[1470.58s -> 1473.54s]  we have the full Santa Claus outfit. And if we get like a cool,
[1474.44s -> 1499.94s]  kind of like candy cane paint. Manco ticket. Okay. That's really cool. But how cool is it?
[1499.94s -> 1515.46s]  Field tested again. Looks great, but another field tested. Gosh darn it. I would put it on a blade.
[1516.39s -> 1534.30s]  Ice blade. Not bad. It's cool. Starlight Serenity War Paint. All right. So that's the one you want.
[1541.43s -> 1557.54s]  Ooh, that looks pretty good. I don't see very much wrong with this and a strange count transfer tool.
[1557.54s -> 1571.61s]  Oh, here it is. It is factory new. All right. It's one of the lower tiers,
[1571.61s -> 1598.84s]  but that's fine. It's factory new. Holy shit. I'm going to be so annoying. That's really annoying,
[1598.84s -> 1607.61s]  but I think it kind of has to be there and put the festivizer on it. Yeah, that's funny.
[1607.61s -> 1627.22s]  Okay. That leads to this one. This is another Scream Fortress 14. Cream corned war paint.
[1627.22s -> 1643.05s]  This is beat up a lot. That does not look good. Well worn. Yeah, it doesn't look terrible.
[1643.05s -> 1667.51s]  It could work on something. You can put it on the fish. That's funny. It looks sick.
[1667.51s -> 1676.92s]  Yeah, no one's going to get that close to see it anyways. All right. So now we've got
[1676.92s -> 1686.04s]  down to the last little bits of war paint. This was jungle jackpot. I don't have any of these.
[1686.04s -> 1700.09s]  Give me a, give me like a factory new. Give me a fact. I only got one factory new. Shit.
[1700.09s -> 1723.26s]  Bamboo brushed war paint. Yeah. The scarring on it looks a little weird. It's the weed one.
[1723.26s -> 1731.22s]  Yeah. This one's kind of, this one's kind of junk. Although it's really not that bad.
[1731.22s -> 1740.42s]  It's a little junky. It's a lot junky. That's a lot junky. The scuffs messes with the pattern
[1740.42s -> 1746.09s]  because without the scuffs, it would still have this, at least this shading here.
[1746.09s -> 1764.10s]  So it just makes it look kind of all broken, but it's art. That looks pretty good. I think
[1764.10s -> 1777.03s]  that's a factory new and it's a leopard print. Oh, nice. Okay. What else? Another Manco ticket.
[1777.03s -> 1782.98s]  I want to see. It is factory new. Nice. All right. What am I going to put the
[1782.98s -> 1810.04s]  leopard print on? Damn. Wait, it can be different colors. Whoa. That's cool. That's really cool.
[1810.04s -> 1815.43s]  Everything looks so good on the mini gun. There's just so much surface area.
[1815.43s -> 1819.85s]  All right. That's, I'm going to have to, that's going to take a decision
[1819.85s -> 1837.46s]  because it works on almost everything. That looks awesome. Cool. All right. I got a good one.
[1837.46s -> 1841.80s]  Even if it's not, it's a low rarity, but who cares? Again, I'm not looking for rare. I'm
[1841.80s -> 1846.12s]  not looking for unusuals. I'm not looking for anything like that. I'm just, I just want more
[1847.34s -> 1852.22s]  cosmetic items because I just don't have very many. All right. This is Infernal Reward.
[1852.22s -> 1858.49s]  I don't know what this is or what year this is, but this is, we got two more of these.
[1858.49s -> 1867.58s]  Yeah. I don't even care if it's like field tested as long as it looks kind of cool.
[1867.58s -> 1881.99s]  Okay. Strange part. Tanks destroyed and merc stained war paint. Tanks destroyed.
[1881.99s -> 1892.20s]  Man vs. Machine. It's going to be field tested. No, that's, that's fine. That doesn't look like
[1892.20s -> 1899.26s]  minimal wear. That looks kind of beat up. It looks pretty beat up. This looks beat up.
[1899.26s -> 1912.66s]  I'm surprised that's minimal wear. What do the other ones look like if that's what it looks like
[1912.66s -> 1935.53s]  for, I like that. Cool. It's too bright. I think it looks all right. All right. This is the last
[1935.53s -> 1948.14s]  one of these. And then we only have the cases that are this current event. Cardboard box,
[1953.48s -> 1980.49s]  minimal wear. So this is just a cardboard item. Put it on the black box. That's a great place to
[1980.49s -> 2001.11s]  put it. Cardboard rocket launcher. It's the Labo. It does look like the Labo. Cool. All right. So now
[2002.10s -> 2011.05s]  we just got these four left and it's the summer 2023 stuff. So what do I want from here? Put that
[2011.05s -> 2027.78s]  on the wrap assassin because it's not always the red rare items that people want. Do the war paint
[2027.78s -> 2034.54s]  first because that's less exciting. Okay. Let's go. All right. This is it. This is this update.
[2034.54s -> 2052.92s]  Let's see what happens. That looks pretty new. That looks pretty new. What? I didn't see. What
[2052.92s -> 2074.86s]  was it? It is factory new. Nice. Inspect the cases to see the options. I like to be surprised
[2074.86s -> 2077.82s]  because I don't, I don't want to see what I can get because then I'll go, I don't want that. I
[2077.82s -> 2081.64s]  don't want that. I don't want that. I don't want that. I want that. And then my brain is like,
[2081.64s -> 2091.58s]  you're opening this case to get that item, which is not going to happen. Right? It looks great on
[2091.58s -> 2108.87s]  the degreaser. That's a smart gambler. I don't know if that, that's not, that statement doesn't
[2108.87s -> 2125.56s]  hold on. Okay. Smart gambler. Oh, oh, it's a good one, but it's all fucked up. Where is it? No,
[2125.56s -> 2140.73s]  that's not bad. Minimal wear. It's kind of just like steel. Yeah. Just stainless steel. Scatter
[2140.73s -> 2157.26s]  gun. Put it on the fish. What about the knife? Flamethrower. I like that a lot because a
[2157.26s -> 2163.48s]  flamethrower would be kind of steel, wouldn't it? Like a propane tank. I kind of like that.
[2163.48s -> 2178.18s]  Put it on the fish. Let's see. Stainless steel fish. Yeah. That actually is really,
[2178.18s -> 2193.98s]  really cool. That's pretty cool. All right. Here we go. This is it. This is why you all
[2193.98s -> 2212.17s]  waited this long for me to do this. What's in the cosmetic case for 2023? All right. Okay. Okay.
[2212.17s -> 2230.52s]  That's all right. It's pretty cool. I don't love it, but I don't hate it. I just wanted more
[2230.52s -> 2256.30s]  options. All right. And this is it. This is the last one. No more cases after this. Here we go.
[2256.30s -> 2270.26s]  No unusual. Oh well. It's not what I was looking for though. I got a couple more heavy jackets,
[2270.26s -> 2293.11s]  the frayed edges. We need to make the call. Does the strange part count as a strange? Um,
[2293.11s -> 2302.50s]  I don't know. Can you open, can you unbox strange versions of items? I don't think that counts. No,
[2302.98s -> 2310.17s]  you can unbox a strange. So a strange part. I don't think it is like a strange item, right?
[2310.17s -> 2319.24s]  You can get strange war paints. Okay. Yeah. I don't think that counts. I think we were referring to
[2319.24s -> 2328.47s]  like orange letters out of the box. It's like a strange part, strange weapon not part. All right.
[2328.47s -> 2338.73s]  Well, there we go. Cool. I got a new, I'm so glad that I got this. I only had to spend, um,
[2338.73s -> 2351.05s]  that's kind of like a lot for a pair of fucking shoes. Yeah. That's fun. You should buy 50 more.
[2352.94s -> 2363.46s]  No. If, okay, if I collect some more, I have some other cases like old crates, the old crates,
[2363.46s -> 2375.66s]  but maybe another time crack them open. Nah, maybe another time. Maybe another time. All right.
[2375.66s -> 2382.58s]  That's going to be it. Uh, before we go, I do want to bring something up. So if you're just still
[2382.58s -> 2391.74s]  hanging out, let me just head over here. So I want to bring this up. I want to talk about this is
[2391.74s -> 2397.38s]  really actually very, very serious. Um, so I'm not, this is no, no joking around right now. I'm
[2397.38s -> 2405.50s]  talking to you pretty real. Uh, those of you that remember the Nevada Science Center, Science
[2405.50s -> 2412.70s]  Center Nevada, remember Science Center Josh, remember? Well, we, we got word. We heard that
[2412.70s -> 2419.85s]  Josh was in a pretty, pretty major accident and it's very, very tragic. It's actually really,
[2419.85s -> 2427.98s]  really sad and really awful. And they have a GoFundMe to try to help out. And those of you
[2427.98s -> 2434.70s]  that don't know who this is, if you watch the archeology stream where Grotto Beast was from,
[2434.70s -> 2441.32s]  he was on the stream. He was a big part of that. And if the, can the mods link it? Can we get it
[2441.32s -> 2451.93s]  like pinned? That's really terrible. So if you can spare anything, there's a link. It's a really,
[2451.93s -> 2458.60s]  really sad, really tragic, but he was a great guy and it's a great family. And it's a, it's a really,
[2458.60s -> 2465.82s]  really terrible tragic thing to happen. He made that stream so much more fun. So hopefully,
[2465.82s -> 2476.30s]  you know, we can help out a little weekend. Yeah. I just wanted to kind of bring it up,
[2476.30s -> 2489.61s]  put some attention to it. Yeah. Yeah. Cause when we, when we heard about it, it was just like,
[2490.86s -> 2497.80s]  like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, that's too good of a fucking family, too good of a people.
[2497.80s -> 2505.24s]  It really, really is just so, it hurts. I didn't, I don't know them very well, but they came out and
[2505.24s -> 2521.46s]  they really made that stream something special and it makes me feel terrible. Yeah. So if you can,
[2523.14s -> 2539.67s]  it's there. Yeah. It's a terrible situation. Yeah. We're, we're, I'm just, when we heard about it,
[2539.67s -> 2543.83s]  I was just devastated. I said, how do you, how do you even, what do you even say when you see
[2543.83s -> 2551.13s]  something like that and you know, it's just so, but we can help. We will. And I, I want to at least
[2551.13s -> 2556.76s]  make sure that I talked about it because I know a lot of people really found that stream to be in
[2556.76s -> 2560.68s]  Grotto. It's like a Grotto beast. Grotto beast has become like a really great success. Like it's been
[2560.68s -> 2567.21s]  really fun. I'm very fortunate over here to have that project be a success as much as it was.
[2570.82s -> 2579.61s]  So we're going to ping this in the discord too. We're going to do an announcement in the discord.
[2579.61s -> 2593.10s]  Yeah. And best of luck to that family recovering as best as they can. But yeah, I will see you guys
[2593.10s -> 2602.17s]  later. I'll see you on, Ster's going to be hanging out for a little while. So probably next week,
[2602.17s -> 2607.14s]  I do have some stuff that I have to do for work that I need to make sure I take care of. So next
[2607.14s -> 2617.35s]  week, keep an eye on the sus. Ster is going to be here. Yeah. Take care of yourselves. It's great
[2617.35s -> 2623.67s]  to hang out. I know this was a short one, but yeah, just it's fun. It's fun just to hang out and just
[2623.75s -> 2642.17s]  talk. Relax. Have a great week. I'll see you all very soon. Take care. Cool crates. Yeah,
[2642.17s -> 2656.68s]  that was kind of fun too. Opening crates is fun. Now I got some new outfits. Yeah. See you soon.
[2656.68s -> 2665.06s]  Take care. See you next week. Oh, I'll, there'll be some Grotto beasts digital tabletop simulator
[2665.06s -> 2672.15s]  news. I know people have been waiting for that. Been being developed for a long time. So it's,
[2672.15s -> 2677.48s]  we're going to have some stuff to talk about. So Grotto beast, Grotto beast is going to be
[2677.48s -> 2684.62s]  coming back in the digital space. Are you going to talk about it next stream?
[2685.99s -> 2694.01s]  Maybe. That's very possible. Pog, I got no clue what's going on.
[2697.74s -> 2706.36s]  Thanks for the support. Thank you. All right. I'll see you guys later. Take care.
