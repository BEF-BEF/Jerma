[1.34s -> 13.80s]  Uh, Glove Buddies lost that one. We're gonna do... It's so dark in here. Time for blood.
[13.80s -> 24.20s]  Change the title to Blood, with an exclamation point.
[26.36s -> 30.95s]  This, this game actually looks really cool. I think I'm gonna be really into this.
[30.95s -> 44.52s]  I think I very much would be into this game. Make sure that it's not too loud.
[44.52s -> 80.60s]  Yeah, it's called Blood Fresh Supply. This is a boomer shooter?
[80.60s -> 83.80s]  Yeah, it actually is, but apparently it's really fucking good. I'm into it.
[93.62s -> 98.02s]  Blood, this is based. It's really hard. Okay, well, let's fucking go. You don't think I'm ready?
[101.42s -> 105.34s]  Gameplay setup. All right, full 3D aim. I think this is all fine. Auto crouch, auto aim.
[107.46s -> 121.93s]  Put that on? Uh, what do I do? No dodge roll? Hey, I'm nine and saw you were playing Glover.
[121.93s -> 125.90s]  I don't think you're even allowed to be on Twitch, by the way. I'm just out of curiosity.
[126.82s -> 135.85s]  Okay, I think we're good. New game. The Way of All Flesh. These, okay, these are difficulties, right?
[135.85s -> 141.13s]  The Way of All Flesh. Even death may die. Farewell to arms. Dead reckoning. Post-mortem. So this is,
[141.13s -> 145.59s]  like, difficulty. I need to be in the middle. This is how they named shit back in, like,
[145.59s -> 153.00s]  boomer shooter days. All these are maps. Oh, episodes, okay. The Way of All Flesh.
[154.20s -> 160.68s]  Here, okay. Still kicking. Think on the inside. Lightly broiled. Well done. Extra crispy. Okay,
[160.68s -> 171.08s]  here we go. So let's do, uh, what should I do for these? I'm not doing extra crispy, no way.
[173.02s -> 177.42s]  I'm not doing still kicking and I'm not doing extra crispy. Gotta be somewhere in the middle.
[177.42s -> 185.58s]  I would get my burgers somewhere in here. Like, lightly broiled. Well, lightly broiled to well
[185.58s -> 225.75s]  done. I made my choice. Bugleberry. Was it Darth Vader? What?
[258.10s -> 276.76s]  Game's quiet. Okay, I have a pitchfork. Okay, I have no other weapons. All right, let's go.
[276.76s -> 300.98s]  I have 82 fucking health already. What happened? Oh, this is one of those, this is one of those
[300.98s -> 322.14s]  insanely hard boomer shooters. I'm ready. Yo, I'm already fucking dead.
[331.51s -> 341.50s]  I'm already dead, guys. I'm already dead. What the fuck? Are you supposed to, uh, lightly broiled?
[341.50s -> 353.30s]  No way. We're going down a difficulty. This is too hard. No, no, no. I don't want to light this yet.
[356.82s -> 381.66s]  I have 18 health. Open for business. Jesus Christ. These sound effects are fucking crazy.
[385.24s -> 396.73s]  I can't, I'm, I'm not gonna be able to go in here. What the fuck? How am I supposed to do this?
[397.90s -> 407.78s]  Oh, you have a gun? No, I don't. It's too dark in here too. Hold on. I don't even have a gun.
[408.58s -> 429.91s]  Dude, I don't, I don't have a gun. Why did I just go? I'm gray. Why am I so gray? What happened to
[429.91s -> 467.98s]  my camera? Okay, that's better. All right. So what the fuck? New game? All right. Turn 3D aim on.
[467.98s -> 483.82s]  Pink on the inside. Try this one. There's a shotgun outside the cemetery. Really?
[484.62s -> 515.53s]  Okay. Those guys die in one hit now. Not like 10. This looks sick. I'm, I, I'm into this. Jesus.
[515.53s -> 524.74s]  This is still fucking hard. Oh, skull key. Glover difficulty. Where's the shotgun you guys talking
[524.74s -> 532.42s]  about? Where is it? I got the flare gun. Yeah. I only have like four shots in it though. Don't waste
[532.42s -> 544.46s]  the flares. All right. It's in the, it's in the tomb. Oh shit. Okay. It's stuck. It's stuck.
[545.02s -> 586.33s]  Did I blow it up? You fucking lied. It's stuck. Open for business. You liars. What the fuck? How
[586.33s -> 617.61s]  do I open it? Press and hold the mouse to throw TNT further. All right. Cool. All right. So where's,
[618.57s -> 624.25s]  how do I, can I actually get in there or are you guys lying? Is that a chipmunk?
[625.21s -> 662.28s]  Why is there a chipmunk? Case of TNT. They can't get up here, right? What does that do? Oh,
[662.28s -> 673.21s]  shortcut. All right. What the fuck? What do I crouch? See a bunch of flares. Eight shots. All
[673.21s -> 689.80s]  right. F5 is saved. Oh my God. I'm sorry. I just like punched you. F5. Okay. Nice. What the fuck?
[698.95s -> 721.42s]  What the fuck is happening? What's quick load? What's quick load? F6. F7. Please. I beg you.
[721.42s -> 742.12s]  3D aim. F0. Full 3D aim look. Okay. Input setup. All right. Configure findings. Use. Next weapon.
[742.12s -> 750.33s]  Weapon. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mines. Bombs. Jump boots. Diving suit. Beast vision. Med kit.
[750.89s -> 769.43s]  Maybe I have med kits. Chat. Chase cam. Okay. F3. Quick load is empty. What are you talking about?
[769.75s -> 777.58s]  I screenshot. God damn it. Are you kidding me? No, you're not, right? I didn't. I screenshot.
[779.85s -> 801.13s]  You piece of fucking shit. Let's go. I live again. Screenshot. All right. So it's F2.
[801.77s -> 830.74s]  You motherfucker. You're so ridiculous. That's so much damage. That's so damaged. That's so
[830.74s -> 848.01s]  much damage. It's ridiculous how much damage that is. How are you? Open for business.
[848.65s -> 856.86s]  That's just Rorschach from The Weathermen. No, The Watchmen.
[857.58s -> 895.77s]  Fuck you. Nice. Okay. I got it. I'm getting it. Local temperature. 85 degrees.
[898.06s -> 919.38s]  Chance of precipitation. 40%. Fuck. What the fuck? Oh my God. Fuck it. I don't even care. I didn't
[919.38s -> 955.50s]  kill everything. Get away from me. TNT. Got it. What the? Oh my fucking God. You spawn out of nowhere.
[955.50s -> 977.18s]  Reload. There's another motherfucker right here. What the fuck are you talking about?
[977.18s -> 1010.42s]  What are you talking about? What are you talking about? Are they still alive? Can I pick this up?
[1010.42s -> 1035.50s]  Whoa. What's in here? Got it. Okay. Fire. Can I pick this shit up? Employees must wash hands.
[1040.65s -> 1047.93s]  That like is inside of my head when he says things. Can I open any of this?
[1062.92s -> 1078.97s]  Doctor's bag. All right. Health is H, right? It's M. Okay. Is it a full heal? H is holster.
[1078.97s -> 1096.31s]  Why was he holster in this game? That makes no sense. Oh shit. How do I get that?
[1097.03s -> 1118.39s]  Hell, yeah. I got double flares. 77. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
[1119.19s -> 1120.91s]  Save it? What's going on? 76? . .
[1120.91s -> 1121.11s]  . .
[1121.11s -> 1121.19s]  . . .
[1121.19s -> 1126.73s]  . . gate. . complement. What's happening? What's happening? What's going on? Why is this doing this?
[1126.73s -> 1148.12s]  It's a power up? What am I supposed to use it with? Dude, I don't know.
[1162.23s -> 1170.39s]  Got it. Can I go down? Hit the switch to end the level.
[1170.39s -> 1176.34s]  We only need a lot more of these. We only need a lot more of these.
[1176.34s -> 1230.02s]  Alright, turn the FOV up higher. What are we talking about? Yeah, that's not a thing.
[1231.02s -> 1239.82s]  Get the fuck out of here.
[1240.82s -> 1243.25s]  There we go, okay. So what's in here?
[1247.26s -> 1251.33s]  Your tax dollars at work. Department of Transportation Track Replacement Program.
[1253.72s -> 1254.72s]  It's a DOS game remake?
[1255.72s -> 1258.72s]  Fresh victims for the ever-growing army of the undead.
[1258.72s -> 1264.82s]  Dead.
[1265.82s -> 1266.82s]  Oh, there's people in here.
[1269.73s -> 1270.73s]  Shotgun.
[1272.03s -> 1274.03s]  I'm not using any weapons until I have to, right? There's probably bosses and shit.
[1275.03s -> 1294.38s]  I need health.
[1296.71s -> 1298.71s]  Quick save Andy, how would you play this game?
[1302.06s -> 1303.50s]  How would you play it?
[1303.50s -> 1304.50s]  Alternate fire, is it right click?
[1309.13s -> 1310.13s]  How much ammo do I have? Nine, that's it.
[1311.13s -> 1315.25s]  Quick save Andy.
[1324.23s -> 1325.23s]  Shotgun shells.
[1325.23s -> 1338.36s]  What happened? I turned?
[1352.78s -> 1353.78s]  Okay, I'm alright, I'm fine.
[1353.78s -> 1356.24s]  Quick save Andy.
[1357.24s -> 1361.10s]  I don't want to waste that, seriously.
[1361.10s -> 1362.10s]  Die.
[1380.88s -> 1383.08s]  FOV is a display if you scroll down.
[1384.08s -> 1385.08s]  Is it actually?
[1386.08s -> 1390.56s]  Oh my goodness, you're actually not a liar.
[1391.56s -> 1393.63s]  Holy shit.
[1397.56s -> 1398.56s]  Wow.
[1417.91s -> 1418.91s]  Sounds like Adam Sandler.
[1429.19s -> 1437.78s]  What?
[1438.78s -> 1442.19s]  Oh my god.
[1445.42s -> 1446.42s]  What? How did I miss everybody?
[1447.42s -> 1448.42s]  That doesn't make any sense.
[1449.42s -> 1455.33s]  What did that school announcement say?
[1456.33s -> 1457.33s]  Yeah, I have no idea, man.
[1460.87s -> 1466.40s]  Wait, is this person bad?
[1467.40s -> 1469.41s]  No, okay.
[1489.27s -> 1523.14s]  Let's go.
[1524.14s -> 1525.82s]  Alright, let me explore for a minute.
[1529.82s -> 1533.17s]  Aim for the head.
[1539.59s -> 1540.59s]  That's the idea.
[1541.59s -> 1545.84s]  I hate how loud that is.
[1546.84s -> 1548.14s]  Nothing else in here, right?
[1549.14s -> 1550.14s]  I don't like that.
[1551.14s -> 1559.74s]  That was close to the electrical thing.
[1567.19s -> 1569.90s]  I think we're good.
[1586.25s -> 1587.25s]  Did I get him?
[1593.22s -> 1610.78s]  Which phone is ringing?
[1619.13s -> 1620.13s]  Rare books and maps.
[1620.13s -> 1623.42s]  Did I open up all these?
[1624.42s -> 1625.72s]  And we're outside going here?
[1627.66s -> 1631.40s]  No, I didn't do this one.
[1632.40s -> 1633.40s]  No, okay, we're good.
[1634.40s -> 1650.36s]  I need to save ammo.
[1651.36s -> 1652.36s]  How much of these do I have?
[1671.33s -> 1672.33s]  I have 12 of these.
[1673.33s -> 1677.90s]  I can start using them.
[1680.03s -> 1681.03s]  No, no, no, no, no, I refuse.
[1688.16s -> 1694.20s]  This is cheating.
[1695.20s -> 1696.20s]  This is not cheating.
[1701.79s -> 1706.10s]  Come on.
[1707.10s -> 1708.10s]  Eel with H?
[1709.10s -> 1725.64s]  H is a holster, right?
[1726.64s -> 1732.17s]  Where?
[1737.38s -> 1745.14s]  Jesus.
[1746.14s -> 1748.41s]  Oh my God.
[1749.41s -> 1754.23s]  I want to reload.
[1762.83s -> 1763.83s]  You got the key, man?
[1771.86s -> 1795.82s]  Where's the key?
[1799.49s -> 1803.22s]  Alright, open that back up.
[1804.22s -> 1810.01s]  I can't open it again?
[1821.30s -> 1835.21s]  Why won't this open?
[1841.82s -> 1842.82s]  What's going on?
[1846.24s -> 1847.24s]  How come I can't open it?
[1853.79s -> 1857.21s]  I pressed the button.
[1863.12s -> 1864.12s]  Okay, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[1874.77s -> 1875.77s]  So I still need a key.
[1878.80s -> 1879.80s]  What if I get a key to go up here?
[1883.34s -> 1891.24s]  Press M?
[1892.24s -> 1895.02s]  Holy shit.
[1896.45s -> 1897.45s]  That was very weird.
[1898.45s -> 1899.75s]  Okay, so what?
[1906.82s -> 1907.82s]  That one reloads so bad.
[1910.98s -> 1924.50s]  You have no idea.
[1925.50s -> 1926.50s]  It was pretty interesting.
[1927.50s -> 1928.50s]  They just need farting and it'd be perfect.
[1935.50s -> 1936.50s]  Oh, I thought it was going to be a new melee weapon.
[1938.90s -> 1939.90s]  I like my hands, bloody.
[1944.34s -> 1945.34s]  Leftovers.
[1948.69s -> 1949.69s]  Nothing in here?
[1952.77s -> 1959.26s]  Whoa.
[1963.82s -> 1964.82s]  What does that do?
[1972.34s -> 1977.80s]  What's going on?
[1978.80s -> 1981.51s]  Wait, let me out of here.
[1986.66s -> 1987.66s]  What's up?
[1997.79s -> 2003.51s]  Is that opening a door?
[2004.51s -> 2005.51s]  What's that doing?
[2014.75s -> 2015.75s]  Don't tell me to do that if it's not going to do anything.
[2019.04s -> 2020.04s]  Leftovers.
[2021.04s -> 2022.04s]  That's me saying that?
[2023.04s -> 2025.04s]  I have the same dialogue?
[2040.17s -> 2041.17s]  No, it burns, it burns.
[2042.17s -> 2048.03s]  Okay, I've got shotgun shells and more TNT.
[2049.03s -> 2050.03s]  I have fucking 21 of these.
[2051.03s -> 2052.03s]  So what is this doing?
[2053.03s -> 2054.27s]  I press this button and it...
[2055.27s -> 2056.27s]  Ooh, what'd I get?
[2056.27s -> 2059.30s]  What'd I get?
[2060.30s -> 2061.30s]  Limited invisibility.
[2062.74s -> 2063.74s]  Okay, what do I do?
[2065.68s -> 2066.68s]  What do I go with this?
[2070.03s -> 2077.10s]  I don't know what to do.
[2079.04s -> 2087.90s]  Oh my God, I did it.
[2088.90s -> 2094.92s]  I think that guy was hard.
[2095.92s -> 2105.02s]  Why is that on the screen?
[2116.43s -> 2117.43s]  Okay, I got the key and now I can go back in that room.
[2118.43s -> 2121.59s]  That just got intense.
[2122.59s -> 2129.46s]  That was fucking terrifying.
[2130.46s -> 2132.73s]  172 health, holy crap.
[2135.06s -> 2136.06s]  Should I go down here?
[2140.75s -> 2141.75s]  No, this is just right outside.
[2142.75s -> 2143.75s]  This game still holds up?
[2145.63s -> 2146.63s]  I'm very much enjoying this.
[2148.58s -> 2149.58s]  It's quiet.
[2157.60s -> 2158.60s]  Where was the way to go to get out?
[2165.22s -> 2166.22s]  Over here and then up this way, right?
[2173.54s -> 2174.54s]  The bookstore or something?
[2175.54s -> 2179.14s]  It was like up here.
[2180.77s -> 2181.77s]  Where was it?
[2185.76s -> 2186.94s]  I don't remember where to go.
[2190.29s -> 2198.18s]  I think it's over here.
[2202.18s -> 2208.92s]  Yeah, it's right here.
[2215.22s -> 2216.22s]  Oh!
[2218.80s -> 2225.08s]  Got it.
[2226.08s -> 2227.08s]  Unironically, I picked this up a few years back and it was super enjoyable.
[2228.08s -> 2229.08s]  Definitely more than a lot of the other classic ones.
[2230.08s -> 2231.45s]  Yeah, this is fun.
[2238.66s -> 2244.90s]  Is this Glover?
[2245.90s -> 2246.90s]  I mean, no.
[2247.90s -> 2249.33s]  Does it have to be?
[2254.60s -> 2255.60s]  Okay, it's nothing connected here.
[2261.32s -> 2262.32s]  Do you know why I like this?
[2263.32s -> 2264.32s]  Because it reminds me of Dusk.
[2265.32s -> 2266.50s]  We just played the other Dusk dev game and I'm playing Dusk again.
[2267.50s -> 2269.63s]  God, what a fucking fun game.
[2270.63s -> 2271.63s]  That game was so fucking good.
[2272.63s -> 2273.63s]  It's so good.
[2274.63s -> 2275.63s]  I just wish I could delete my memory and play it again.
[2282.06s -> 2283.06s]  Oh my goodness.
[2298.38s -> 2299.38s]  I feel like I'm watching a stream with TTS on.
[2300.38s -> 2310.26s]  Okay, so I'm on the train.
[2310.26s -> 2322.76s]  I have so much ammo.
[2323.76s -> 2324.76s]  I need a key.
[2325.76s -> 2326.76s]  All right, I need a key.
[2327.76s -> 2332.97s]  So let's back here.
[2333.97s -> 2334.97s]  Oh my God.
[2338.19s -> 2349.42s]  Who's laughing?
[2350.42s -> 2351.42s]  Get off my train.
[2352.42s -> 2353.42s]  That was Bart Simpson.
[2354.42s -> 2355.42s]  That was a Bart Simpson.
[2356.42s -> 2384.58s]  It was absolutely Bart Simpson.
[2385.58s -> 2386.58s]  Is he dead?
[2389.04s -> 2390.04s]  So much TNT.
[2391.86s -> 2394.76s]  It's insane.
[2395.76s -> 2399.69s]  I need a key.
[2400.69s -> 2412.04s]  So many locked doors.
[2423.46s -> 2424.46s]  Oh fuck.
[2425.46s -> 2433.14s]  Oh fuck.
[2434.14s -> 2449.96s]  Who turned the lights off?
[2454.02s -> 2455.90s]  He's still alive.
[2456.90s -> 2458.71s]  Is that a chest?
[2460.46s -> 2461.46s]  Beast Vision?
[2462.46s -> 2463.46s]  What's that do?
[2464.46s -> 2466.54s]  Why are you good at this?
[2468.99s -> 2476.44s]  I'm telling you right now.
[2478.96s -> 2479.96s]  You give me three buttons and I'll be proud.
[2481.71s -> 2482.71s]  That's all folks.
[2483.71s -> 2484.71s]  All right.
[2489.02s -> 2491.42s]  I'm just going to use the shotgun.
[2492.42s -> 2494.49s]  What is Beast Vision?
[2495.49s -> 2497.88s]  Life Seed?
[2501.30s -> 2513.10s]  That doesn't count.
[2522.85s -> 2523.85s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[2524.85s -> 2525.85s]  Do it again, do it again, do it again, do it again.
[2527.22s -> 2564.81s]  I'm just going to go shoot.
[2565.81s -> 2566.81s]  I don't know.
[2567.81s -> 2578.65s]  I thought maybe there's like a ledge or something I could jump.
[2581.62s -> 2589.06s]  Why would this be here?
[2590.06s -> 2591.06s]  What happened?
[2592.06s -> 2593.06s]  Something out there?
[2596.54s -> 2597.54s]  Why would I be able to do this?
[2598.54s -> 2603.82s]  Why can I open up all these?
[2606.02s -> 2607.02s]  I don't get it.
[2609.02s -> 2610.02s]  What's that for?
[2611.02s -> 2612.84s]  Is there a double jump?
[2618.50s -> 2619.50s]  Secret windows?
[2621.25s -> 2622.25s]  Dude, I'm not even using it.
[2624.32s -> 2625.32s]  You're overthinking it?
[2626.32s -> 2627.32s]  Do a TNT jump.
[2632.34s -> 2633.34s]  Wait, no.
[2634.77s -> 2642.98s]  I'm going the wrong way.
[2643.98s -> 2644.98s]  What's that?
[2645.98s -> 2647.86s]  Super armor.
[2648.86s -> 2649.86s]  Holy shit.
[2654.30s -> 2655.30s]  Okay, cool.
[2656.30s -> 2657.48s]  Fuck you.
[2661.41s -> 2662.41s]  This is the end of the train.
[2670.18s -> 2671.18s]  Did I get a key?
[2672.18s -> 2700.10s]  I don't think I got a key.
[2705.25s -> 2706.25s]  Oh, I did get a skull key.
[2710.18s -> 2715.51s]  All right.
[2716.94s -> 2725.53s]  No.
[2739.82s -> 2746.57s]  What the fuck?
[2747.57s -> 2750.02s]  So much shotgun ammo.
[2753.63s -> 2757.24s]  Oh, it's a toilet.
[2758.24s -> 2760.57s]  Okay.
[2761.57s -> 2762.87s]  I've got a hundred ammo here.
[2770.26s -> 2774.31s]  Did I get them all?
[2783.55s -> 2784.55s]  Oh, this shit's locked.
[2785.55s -> 2794.41s]  Right, okay.
[2795.41s -> 2806.06s]  These are all locked doors.
[2807.06s -> 2812.71s]  How did I kill the one in the room?
[2813.71s -> 2814.71s]  What?
[2818.38s -> 2819.38s]  Right click on the zombies.
[2822.42s -> 2828.39s]  Auto aim might be on.
[2830.21s -> 2831.21s]  You're playing on easy?
[2834.82s -> 2838.34s]  Oh, look at how good I am at this game.
[2839.64s -> 2840.64s]  It's shot quiet.
[2841.64s -> 2842.64s]  No, I ain't going to hear that.
[2845.67s -> 2846.67s]  I ain't going to hear that.
[2848.49s -> 2852.03s]  All right.
[2856.98s -> 2858.99s]  Where was I going?
[2864.38s -> 2865.38s]  Okay, down.
[2868.15s -> 2869.65s]  And then I can go this way.
[2872.65s -> 2877.60s]  Blastovers.
[2882.87s -> 2883.87s]  Am I doing anything in here?
[2891.00s -> 2892.00s]  Cheater exposed.
[2893.00s -> 2899.04s]  I'm not cheating.
[2900.04s -> 2907.94s]  What?
[2907.94s -> 2914.30s]  You can play like this?
[2915.30s -> 2929.27s]  Oh, he's got auto aim on, doesn't he?
[2930.27s -> 2931.27s]  He's got auto aim.
[2932.27s -> 2933.27s]  That's why he's doing all this.
[2957.04s -> 2958.04s]  I keep trying to reload and I don't need to do that.
[2963.57s -> 2969.86s]  Did I do it?
[2971.42s -> 2972.42s]  Oh shit, I did it.
[2987.87s -> 2988.87s]  Oh fuck.
[2989.87s -> 3027.78s]  Oh my God, what's happening?
[3042.21s -> 3043.58s]  What?
[3044.58s -> 3045.58s]  Please use your med kits, press M.
[3046.58s -> 3060.68s]  I got 113 health, I don't even use a med kit.
[3061.68s -> 3068.62s]  I must stop this train.
[3069.62s -> 3074.63s]  Can I stop it?
[3075.63s -> 3077.19s]  Internal engine heat is critical.
[3080.80s -> 3081.80s]  I'm on the train.
[3084.19s -> 3085.19s]  Aren't I on the train?
[3090.66s -> 3105.14s]  Oh, I did it, okay.
[3106.14s -> 3107.64s]  What happened to Glover?
[3111.25s -> 3115.26s]  Well, the Glove buddies couldn't keep it afloat, unfortunately.
[3131.47s -> 3133.86s]  What's over here?
[3134.86s -> 3135.86s]  Can I like power through this?
[3143.12s -> 3146.73s]  What is this?
[3153.92s -> 3159.62s]  That it?
[3160.62s -> 3163.85s]  That's scary, that sound.
[3164.85s -> 3168.71s]  I think there's nothing else I can do here.
[3172.19s -> 3175.03s]  How do I get out of here?
[3176.03s -> 3178.10s]  That was a Glover reference.
[3181.58s -> 3191.21s]  Step right up.
[3193.28s -> 3194.71s]  This promises to be fun.
[3195.71s -> 3203.42s]  Did I get it?
[3205.74s -> 3213.45s]  Yep, okay.
[3217.18s -> 3218.18s]  Get the fuck out of here.
[3223.50s -> 3224.50s]  Oh my God.
[3230.79s -> 3231.79s]  That was way too much.
[3234.95s -> 3248.80s]  Got it, okay.
[3249.80s -> 3253.02s]  I'm not going in there yet.
[3254.02s -> 3259.28s]  There's a secret in the water.
[3260.28s -> 3275.54s]  What the fuck?
[3276.54s -> 3284.56s]  I'm drowning.
[3285.56s -> 3286.56s]  What's even down here?
[3287.56s -> 3291.68s]  Oh my goodness.
[3293.30s -> 3294.30s]  There's nobody for me to even shoot at.
[3294.30s -> 3305.98s]  Let's go.
[3306.98s -> 3308.54s]  I hate mimes.
[3310.16s -> 3322.00s]  All right, there's games I can play.
[3323.00s -> 3332.30s]  Okay, how about this?
[3333.30s -> 3358.46s]  This is like a ball game?
[3359.46s -> 3388.80s]  Why is it shooting it out?
[3411.16s -> 3412.16s]  Fuck you game.
[3416.98s -> 3417.98s]  There's another one, where is it?
[3418.98s -> 3430.19s]  What's this one?
[3433.10s -> 3434.10s]  I want that.
[3435.10s -> 3445.34s]  How am I supposed to shoot with the shotgun?
[3446.34s -> 3450.72s]  What am I supposed to shoot them with?
[3452.33s -> 3454.33s]  This is better than cruel aid.
[3455.33s -> 3461.24s]  Does he talk?
[3469.97s -> 3471.97s]  Jojo the idiot circus boy.
[3474.55s -> 3475.55s]  Jumping boots?
[3480.25s -> 3486.03s]  Can't go in there.
[3492.33s -> 3496.06s]  And they had rat dogs.
[3498.97s -> 3501.94s]  Who's shooting?
[3502.94s -> 3511.86s]  Can I eat these?
[3515.08s -> 3516.08s]  I don't think so.
[3520.14s -> 3527.84s]  Okay, so I have to shoot it with a shotgun?
[3534.26s -> 3535.26s]  I want it.
[3549.54s -> 3550.54s]  No one wants to play with me.
[3551.54s -> 3553.54s]  This microphone is fucking freaking me out.
[3556.06s -> 3557.06s]  All right, so I did that.
[3560.03s -> 3565.18s]  What's this one?
[3572.30s -> 3592.30s]  Okay, throw a grenade.
[3600.38s -> 3602.38s]  I threw two grenades in here, dude.
[3604.20s -> 3610.86s]  Did he already say eat my shorts?
[3611.86s -> 3618.22s]  Picked up a few bullets.
[3619.97s -> 3628.63s]  All right, nice.
[3629.63s -> 3637.02s]  Old drum of bullets.
[3638.02s -> 3642.52s]  All right, let's do Jojo the idiot circus boy.
[3655.92s -> 3656.92s]  Really?
[3665.50s -> 3666.50s]  This doesn't open from this side, okay.
[3667.50s -> 3675.26s]  Shit.
[3676.26s -> 3682.36s]  Keep out.
[3683.36s -> 3685.11s]  Reflective shots?
[3686.74s -> 3690.41s]  Got it.
[3691.41s -> 3693.10s]  Test your strength.
[3694.10s -> 3695.10s]  Who is talking by the way?
[3710.67s -> 3711.67s]  I guess I can go this way, right?
[3712.67s -> 3717.50s]  Is it going to kill me?
[3718.86s -> 3719.86s]  Wait, what?
[3720.86s -> 3726.46s]  What am I seeing?
[3727.46s -> 3731.45s]  I need a key.
[3732.45s -> 3733.69s]  Jumping boots?
[3734.69s -> 3743.35s]  Oh right, J for jumping boots?
[3745.74s -> 3746.74s]  Okay, so hold on.
[3747.74s -> 3758.84s]  Where is it going to get me to though?
[3763.54s -> 3766.82s]  Did I turn them off?
[3767.82s -> 3772.50s]  Did they have like a, okay.
[3773.50s -> 3777.75s]  Now where do I go?
[3779.76s -> 3781.51s]  Where's the key?
[3785.06s -> 3793.91s]  I missed an area?
[3794.91s -> 3796.15s]  I turned it off, yeah.
[3797.58s -> 3815.58s]  This is locked.
[3816.58s -> 3819.74s]  I could go up here.
[3820.74s -> 3821.74s]  I don't have a key yet though.
[3825.34s -> 3826.34s]  I don't know where I'm supposed to go because I've been up there already.
[3828.29s -> 3840.22s]  I need a key.
[3841.46s -> 3842.46s]  This is locked.
[3843.76s -> 3850.38s]  I don't know.
[3851.38s -> 3860.34s]  By the water, the ticket booth?
[3865.17s -> 3866.17s]  I missed an area?
[3868.75s -> 3869.75s]  Where?
[3879.18s -> 3882.02s]  What are you talking about?
[3883.02s -> 3884.02s]  That's the key?
[3885.84s -> 3886.84s]  Oh my goodness.
[3889.74s -> 3890.74s]  Okay, but how do I get in here?
[3891.74s -> 3893.75s]  Can I jump?
[3899.92s -> 3900.92s]  Underneath maybe?
[3904.40s -> 3911.53s]  Not underneath?
[3922.43s -> 3927.06s]  What do I do?
[3928.06s -> 3929.37s]  It looks like right there.
[3932.53s -> 3933.53s]  Should I try the jumping boots?
[3945.39s -> 3950.34s]  TNT?
[3951.34s -> 3952.34s]  Oh fuck off.
[3954.16s -> 3955.16s]  I need a key.
[3961.20s -> 3970.25s]  I can't get in here.
[3977.95s -> 3978.95s]  The wall behind the mime.
[3979.95s -> 3986.89s]  Behind the mime?
[3988.64s -> 3991.16s]  That didn't work.
[3992.16s -> 3994.36s]  I don't know.
[3995.36s -> 3999.16s]  What about the freak area?
[4000.16s -> 4001.59s]  Was there a freak area somewhere here?
[4003.28s -> 4004.28s]  I didn't even see this part.
[4005.28s -> 4023.29s]  Oh my god, open the door!
[4024.29s -> 4027.06s]  What the fuck was that?
[4028.06s -> 4047.48s]  This is terrifying.
[4048.48s -> 4052.41s]  Fucking Glover.
[4083.98s -> 4091.41s]  That didn't get me anything though, did it?
[4094.82s -> 4095.82s]  Can I blow up one of these walls?
[4097.06s -> 4101.76s]  Oh my goodness, dude.
[4110.42s -> 4115.95s]  What?
[4120.39s -> 4121.39s]  I don't know what to do right now.
[4142.22s -> 4143.22s]  I want Jojo.
[4144.84s -> 4145.84s]  I want Jojo.
[4153.80s -> 4154.80s]  Where is it?
[4156.10s -> 4160.22s]  No!
[4160.22s -> 4161.22s]  Start with the flashing.
[4167.90s -> 4172.60s]  What?
[4173.60s -> 4179.06s]  I got a key.
[4183.70s -> 4184.70s]  Is it fall damage?
[4211.52s -> 4212.52s]  Jump and find out.
[4216.06s -> 4217.24s]  I got the key.
[4218.24s -> 4219.42s]  I can get out of here now.
[4220.42s -> 4224.41s]  I need a key.
[4225.41s -> 4228.70s]  Locked.
[4229.87s -> 4233.54s]  What are you talking about?
[4234.54s -> 4245.30s]  I used the key?
[4246.30s -> 4247.30s]  You got the dagger key.
[4248.30s -> 4249.30s]  Sounds like Resident Evil.
[4260.02s -> 4266.50s]  I get it.
[4267.50s -> 4269.77s]  I have the eye.
[4279.75s -> 4316.06s]  Is it a new weapon?
[4317.06s -> 4321.50s]  Yep.
[4322.50s -> 4323.50s]  Don't use this.
[4327.88s -> 4331.55s]  That doesn't work.
[4333.69s -> 4334.93s]  Right click.
[4335.93s -> 4338.90s]  I can do the double shot.
[4339.90s -> 4340.90s]  Maybe I should make it harder.
[4355.00s -> 4356.50s]  I'm getting too strong.
[4361.64s -> 4367.17s]  Where do I go from here?
[4372.06s -> 4374.96s]  I think that's it.
[4375.96s -> 4379.63s]  Inside the train?
[4381.19s -> 4382.19s]  There's a door in here.
[4388.04s -> 4396.75s]  Where?
[4400.49s -> 4401.49s]  I got pranked.
[4401.49s -> 4412.97s]  Inside the train?
[4417.02s -> 4418.02s]  In here?
[4420.10s -> 4423.26s]  I think you guys are lying.
[4424.26s -> 4425.26s]  Eye door?
[4426.26s -> 4433.83s]  There's a window in the train.
[4440.26s -> 4441.50s]  You guys are making stuff.
[4445.94s -> 4446.94s]  You're making it up.
[4447.94s -> 4449.94s]  Now we're going to go to the eye door.
[4452.14s -> 4454.79s]  Where was that door?
[4458.59s -> 4459.59s]  I don't remember.
[4461.34s -> 4462.34s]  I think it was further out.
[4463.34s -> 4471.54s]  Like this way.
[4472.85s -> 4476.26s]  That's the dagger.
[4484.35s -> 4486.62s]  Where was that?
[4490.29s -> 4491.29s]  Down that hallway?
[4492.29s -> 4499.10s]  Moon key?
[4503.79s -> 4504.79s]  I'm not down in here.
[4506.61s -> 4508.61s]  That 80's scary sound effect.
[4509.61s -> 4510.61s]  It's so horrible.
[4511.85s -> 4514.18s]  It's actually terrifying.
[4520.47s -> 4521.47s]  Where is it?
[4539.93s -> 4540.93s]  I'm going in the water I guess.
[4545.05s -> 4546.05s]  Oh shit.
[4547.05s -> 4548.05s]  Oh my.
[4549.05s -> 4550.05s]  Really?
[4552.57s -> 4553.57s]  I don't even need to kill this thing.
[4556.15s -> 4565.50s]  Just go.
[4566.50s -> 4567.50s]  I'm going to drown down here if I don't hurry up and get out of here.
[4571.30s -> 4583.94s]  My nose is so itchy.
[4583.94s -> 4588.82s]  I got it.
[4589.82s -> 4590.82s]  60 out of 73.
[4609.98s -> 4644.89s]  6 out of 12.
[4651.38s -> 4652.38s]  Key.
[4653.38s -> 4654.38s]  I can go lower.
[4668.22s -> 4669.22s]  This dude is literally evil.
[4679.30s -> 4693.08s]  I'm going to get up.
[4700.10s -> 4701.10s]  I need a key.

[4704.10s -> 4705.10s]  I need a key.
[4706.10s -> 4711.18s]  I can't open that?

[4843.30s -> 4844.30s]  Moon key.
[4854.12s -> 4855.12s]  Where is that moon door?
[4855.12s -> 4857.64s]  Ah.
[4887.42s -> 4888.42s]  Moon key.
[4891.33s -> 4899.48s]  You idiot.
[4906.29s -> 4907.29s]  Why is the music off?
[4912.94s -> 4918.09s]  It's not off.
[4941.86s -> 4943.10s]  CD music.
[4944.10s -> 4948.22s]  I don't have CD music.
[4949.22s -> 4951.80s]  Don't use CD music.
[4952.80s -> 4953.80s]  What are you talking about?
[4954.80s -> 4956.94s]  I'm trying to get it to work.
[4957.94s -> 4958.94s]  Is this supposed to be like a...
[4959.94s -> 4960.94s]  Am I missing like the...
[4961.94s -> 4962.94s]  Am I missing that?
[4963.94s -> 4977.85s]  Alright don't go anywhere yet.
[4989.07s -> 4996.65s]  Hold on.
[4997.65s -> 4998.65s]  Die.
[5006.48s -> 5007.48s]  This level doesn't play any music.
[5016.78s -> 5017.78s]  Oh what the fuck dude?
[5019.73s -> 5025.26s]  Okay I'm good.
[5025.26s -> 5026.26s]  Oh my goodness.
[5026.26s -> 5050.65s]  Ow.
[5050.65s -> 5051.65s]  Alright I'm looking for a door right?
[5052.65s -> 5056.19s]  What am I looking for?
[5056.19s -> 5057.19s]  I'm looking for like the moon door or something.
[5059.39s -> 5060.39s]  What door am I looking for?
[5060.39s -> 5063.04s]  I don't know where that guy came from.
[5068.70s -> 5069.70s]  No I already got this one.
[5069.70s -> 5070.70s]  It's something else.
[5075.46s -> 5077.98s]  Spider door?
[5083.57s -> 5084.57s]  I want to go through here.
[5084.57s -> 5087.45s]  Oh I got to activate that thing don't I?
[5088.45s -> 5093.34s]  Hold on.
[5093.34s -> 5094.34s]  This?
[5094.34s -> 5095.51s]  No.
[5095.51s -> 5099.31s]  Spider door?
[5102.98s -> 5103.98s]  I don't remember where the spider door is.
[5105.86s -> 5106.86s]  Does it show up on the map?
[5106.86s -> 5116.74s]  That's awful.
[5118.05s -> 5119.05s]  I just say that like...
[5120.05s -> 5121.05s]  Oh my god.
[5121.05s -> 5122.05s]  I fucking god damn it.
[5122.05s -> 5123.05s]  How far back was I?
[5124.67s -> 5125.67s]  I don't remember where this is.
[5125.67s -> 5128.19s]  It's right here.
[5128.19s -> 5133.46s]  I'm fine.
[5133.46s -> 5134.46s]  I forget where I just was.
[5134.46s -> 5139.42s]  Shit.
[5139.42s -> 5140.42s]  I don't...
[5140.42s -> 5145.50s]  I forget where that is.
[5145.50s -> 5146.50s]  I fucking freaked out too.
[5146.50s -> 5151.55s]  I don't remember where that is.
[5151.55s -> 5152.55s]  This way...
[5152.55s -> 5157.06s]  I don't remember.
[5158.06s -> 5175.62s]  Okay.
[5175.62s -> 5176.62s]  I think it's...
[5176.62s -> 5177.62s]  Yep.
[5177.62s -> 5185.90s]  TF2 sound effects?
[5186.90s -> 5195.54s]  New gun.
[5196.54s -> 5197.78s]  Ooh napalm.
[5197.78s -> 5198.78s]  That was loud.
[5201.37s -> 5202.37s]  I just spit all over my mouth.
[5203.61s -> 5204.61s]  Go to the spider door?
[5204.61s -> 5207.45s]  Hold on.
[5207.45s -> 5208.45s]  I got some shit going on here.
[5208.45s -> 5210.01s]  Hold on.
[5211.25s -> 5218.74s]  What did that do?
[5218.74s -> 5219.74s]  Oh my goodness.
[5219.74s -> 5225.08s]  What did that do?
[5226.08s -> 5230.90s]  Gas can?
[5231.90s -> 5237.64s]  You'll know what to do when the time comes.
[5239.33s -> 5240.33s]  Whoa!
[5240.33s -> 5241.33s]  Okay.
[5243.46s -> 5244.46s]  Waste of fucking...
[5244.46s -> 5266.06s]  Where do I go?
[5266.06s -> 5271.14s]  Use the spider door?
[5271.14s -> 5273.14s]  I don't remember where the spider door is guys.
[5273.14s -> 5279.24s]  Is the spider door on the map?
[5279.24s -> 5282.30s]  Where's the spider door?
[5282.30s -> 5283.30s]  Use beast vision?
[5283.30s -> 5291.41s]  Use the spider door on the map.
[5291.41s -> 5292.41s]  Moon door again?
[5292.41s -> 5294.41s]  Gotta go through the CD door.
[5294.41s -> 5296.41s]  Spider door is in the spider room.
[5296.41s -> 5300.95s]  As I was saying, go to the moon door.
[5300.95s -> 5303.92s]  Okay.
[5303.92s -> 5305.61s]  And then...
[5305.61s -> 5307.61s]  Use the among us vision?
[5307.61s -> 5314.69s]  Two portals lead to certain death.
[5314.69s -> 5317.12s]  Choose wisely.
[5317.12s -> 5323.25s]  Oh fog.
[5323.25s -> 5324.25s]  Okay.
[5324.25s -> 5326.06s]  Teeth door?
[5326.06s -> 5328.06s]  Regular door or like mud door.
[5328.06s -> 5332.38s]  Teeth door.
[5332.38s -> 5356.40s]  Did I get it?
[5356.40s -> 5361.67s]  I did it.
[5361.67s -> 5366.02s]  This is a secret if you drop down.
[5366.02s -> 5370.91s]  Okay.
[5370.91s -> 5371.91s]  Ban that guy for 10 minutes.
[5371.91s -> 5376.54s]  What's in the other doors?
[5376.54s -> 5377.54s]  I'm curious.
[5377.54s -> 5378.78s]  Whoa!
[5378.78s -> 5383.74s]  Wrong door.
[5383.74s -> 5410.77s]  What about this one?
[5410.77s -> 5411.77s]  Only one secret?
[5411.77s -> 5424.14s]  That's it?
[5424.14s -> 5425.14s]  I'm almost out of ammo.
[5425.14s -> 5426.58s]  This is bad.
[5426.58s -> 5427.58s]  I gotta start using the flares.
[5427.58s -> 5429.58s]  I have 75 fucking flares.
[5429.58s -> 5438.24s]  I could probably jump that.
[5438.24s -> 5439.24s]  Let's see what's down here.
[5440.24s -> 5442.31s]  Let me try.
[5442.31s -> 5443.31s]  Let me jump that.
[5443.31s -> 5445.32s]  Oh fuck.
[5445.32s -> 5447.97s]  Whatever.
[5447.97s -> 5462.84s]  I can jump this.
[5462.84s -> 5470.20s]  Oh my god!
[5504.29s -> 5505.29s]  Dude!
[5511.46s -> 5516.34s]  Thank you.
[5516.34s -> 5520.34s]  Don't kill me here.
[5520.34s -> 5534.89s]  Oh you motherfucker.
[5534.89s -> 5535.89s]  I swear to god.
[5535.89s -> 5538.58s]  Isn't there full nudity in this game?
[5538.58s -> 5539.58s]  Is there?
[5539.58s -> 5540.94s]  I don't think...
[5540.94s -> 5541.94s]  I don't know.
[5541.94s -> 5558.20s]  A secret is revealed, huh?
[5558.20s -> 5560.44s]  Already got it, didn't I?
[5560.44s -> 5577.36s]  None of these blow up.
[5577.36s -> 5581.50s]  You lost 4k viewers because you stopped playing Glover.
[5581.50s -> 5585.10s]  Oh well.
[5585.10s -> 5586.10s]  Oh!
[5587.10s -> 5590.69s]  And where the fuck did they come from?
[5598.58s -> 5599.58s]  Glover.
[5599.58s -> 5602.14s]  I miss Glover.
[5602.14s -> 5605.92s]  I'm not getting hit by that.
[5605.92s -> 5614.26s]  Ground, please.
[5618.62s -> 5625.10s]  I only have two bullets left.
[5625.10s -> 5627.37s]  Whatever.
[5627.37s -> 5628.37s]  Can we go back to Glover?
[5628.37s -> 5630.31s]  No.
[5630.31s -> 5631.31s]  Let me finish this.
[5634.19s -> 5636.58s]  Let me finish this.
[5636.58s -> 5648.96s]  Where do I go?
[5648.96s -> 5654.04s]  Where do I go?
[5654.04s -> 5656.94s]  Blood is better?
[5656.94s -> 5659.12s]  I'm just playing a game, man.
[5659.12s -> 5662.34s]  How do I get out of here?
[5662.34s -> 5670.47s]  Little old fashioned Glover pull?
[5670.47s -> 5671.47s]  No.
[5671.47s -> 5673.47s]  I'm not doing a Glover pull.
[5674.47s -> 5679.04s]  Do you have your chance?
[5679.04s -> 5684.50s]  Backwards here?
[5685.50s -> 5691.03s]  I don't know where to go.
[5691.03s -> 5693.30s]  It's on the other side.
[5693.30s -> 5694.30s]  Oh shit.
[5694.30s -> 5705.14s]  Hold on.
[5706.14s -> 5708.78s]  Fuck you.
[5708.78s -> 5709.78s]  Come on.
[5709.78s -> 5712.18s]  Really?
[5712.18s -> 5728.39s]  I'm out of juice.
[5728.39s -> 5730.02s]  I'm out of juice.
[5730.02s -> 5734.78s]  I'm out of juice.
[5734.78s -> 5743.63s]  Where do I go?
[5743.63s -> 5752.46s]  Glover across the bridge?
[5752.46s -> 5753.46s]  Oh my goodness.
[5754.46s -> 5769.21s]  Ooh.
[5769.21s -> 5778.26s]  Go back to Glover?
[5778.26s -> 5780.20s]  No.
[5780.20s -> 5781.20s]  You guys had a chance.
[5781.20s -> 5783.20s]  You guys had your chance.
[5783.20s -> 5787.95s]  You threw Glover away because you didn't want to see...
[5787.95s -> 5797.51s]  Not you guys.
[5797.51s -> 5806.69s]  Not you guys.
[5806.69s -> 5813.05s]  Oh gracious.
[5813.05s -> 5814.05s]  Who voted for blood?
[5814.05s -> 5815.22s]  I did.
[5815.22s -> 5816.22s]  I voted for it.
[5816.22s -> 5836.23s]  Oh, dad's playing his boomer shooters.
[5836.23s -> 5841.01s]  Glover, boomer, blood, boomer.
[5841.01s -> 5849.39s]  Is that Dr. Andy?
[5849.39s -> 5853.36s]  How am I a doctor?
[5853.36s -> 5868.02s]  Oh, there he is.
[5868.02s -> 5869.02s]  Dr. Andy.
[5869.02s -> 5872.02s]  I need a key.
[5872.02s -> 5873.02s]  Shit.
[5873.02s -> 5875.03s]  Come on.
[5875.03s -> 5878.83s]  I'm out of ammo.
[5878.83s -> 5881.84s]  I've been streaming for four hours.
[5881.84s -> 5882.84s]  Holy shit.
[5882.84s -> 5884.08s]  Oops.
[5884.08s -> 5885.08s]  Why is that an oops?
[5885.08s -> 5886.08s]  Oh my God.
[5886.08s -> 5887.08s]  Four hours.
[5887.08s -> 5894.53s]  Oops.
[5894.53s -> 5900.10s]  Paging Dr. Andy.
[5900.10s -> 5901.10s]  Paging Dr. Andy.
[5901.10s -> 5903.10s]  Is Dr. Andy in the building, please?
[5903.10s -> 5907.09s]  Paging Dr. Andy.
[5907.09s -> 5913.80s]  We've got a handful of zoomers that don't want to see this old shit.
[5913.80s -> 5918.00s]  And by handful, I mean like 15,000.
[5918.00s -> 5924.78s]  Oh, don't.
[5924.78s -> 5930.10s]  I'm so fucking far away.
[5930.10s -> 5943.60s]  I'm about to delete it.
[5943.60s -> 5955.12s]  Blow up already.
[5955.12s -> 5963.53s]  Blood rocks?
[5963.53s -> 5964.53s]  No, I'm having fun.
[5964.53s -> 5965.53s]  This game is good.
[5965.53s -> 5967.96s]  It's fun just to shoot stuff.
[5967.96s -> 5969.26s]  With my mouth open.
[5969.26s -> 5975.06s]  These same fucking people behind me.
[5975.06s -> 5981.55s]  Fuck.
[5981.55s -> 5991.94s]  Blood buddies?
[5991.94s -> 5993.94s]  No, don't even start this shit.
[5993.94s -> 6005.94s]  Who are the blood buddies?
[6005.94s -> 6017.05s]  Get the fuck.
[6017.05s -> 6039.75s]  Boring buddies?
[6039.75s -> 6047.05s]  The boring buddies.
[6047.05s -> 6049.05s]  I knew you were right there too, you piece of shit.
[6049.05s -> 6051.05s]  This room sucks.
[6051.05s -> 6072.13s]  Should I go in there?
[6072.13s -> 6078.74s]  Oh, that's nothing.
[6078.74s -> 6080.94s]  What did I get?
[6080.94s -> 6082.95s]  I can't go in there.
[6082.95s -> 6087.99s]  Looks like I can go in there, but I can't.
[6087.99s -> 6088.99s]  Play strawberry magic?
[6088.99s -> 6101.70s]  Alright, blood buddies, strawberry buds, TF2, titanium, IQ, brain, friends.
[6101.70s -> 6102.70s]  Whatever you want to call it.
[6102.70s -> 6103.70s]  Whatever.
[6103.70s -> 6113.07s]  I don't know.
[6113.07s -> 6114.07s]  Did I get a key?
[6114.07s -> 6124.40s]  I don't even remember.
[6124.40s -> 6126.40s]  Drew, crew, banana bros.
[6126.40s -> 6129.28s]  I need a key.
[6129.28s -> 6141.42s]  How many factions do we have here?
[6141.42s -> 6144.42s]  How come Glover doesn't need keys, you know?
[6144.42s -> 6151.06s]  What do you want to do after this?
[6151.06s -> 6152.06s]  I'm open to suggestions.
[6152.06s -> 6153.94s]  Not Glover.
[6153.94s -> 6154.94s]  We're not going back to that.
[6154.94s -> 6155.94s]  Everyone will leave.
[6155.94s -> 6162.43s]  I'm not playing Among Us.
[6162.43s -> 6163.43s]  Thriving?
[6163.43s -> 6167.36s]  Whoa.
[6167.36s -> 6178.95s]  Theme, NG, drive?
[6178.95s -> 6179.95s]  Go back to Wobble Dogs?
[6179.95s -> 6182.73s]  We'll see.
[6182.73s -> 6196.80s]  I need some blood buddies to tell me where to go here, because I'm kind of lost.
[6196.80s -> 6201.56s]  I need a key.
[6201.56s -> 6202.56s]  I don't know.
[6202.56s -> 6210.71s]  Am I left?
[6210.71s -> 6213.17s]  Finish Thrillville.
[6213.17s -> 6216.90s]  No.
[6216.90s -> 6222.70s]  You should go to the shut the fuck up room.
[6222.70s -> 6229.38s]  Go into the fire.
[6229.38s -> 6230.38s]  I can't walk in.
[6230.38s -> 6231.38s]  I can't.
[6231.38s -> 6232.38s]  Unless there's something I'm doing wrong.
[6232.38s -> 6233.38s]  Anybody know what to do?
[6233.38s -> 6240.19s]  Go up the stairs.
[6240.19s -> 6243.48s]  There's a new open passage away.
[6243.48s -> 6244.48s]  One of these?
[6244.48s -> 6245.48s]  Oh, dude, you were right.
[6245.48s -> 6246.85s]  You got it.
[6246.85s -> 6248.54s]  Fucking open.
[6248.54s -> 6249.54s]  Nice.
[6249.54s -> 6262.81s]  Oh.
[6262.81s -> 6263.81s]  Oh.
[6263.81s -> 6269.34s]  Stop throwing it so far.
[6269.34s -> 6275.50s]  Got it.
[6275.50s -> 6276.50s]  Shit.
[6276.50s -> 6277.50s]  No, don't die, please.
[6277.50s -> 6286.87s]  All right.
[6286.87s -> 6287.87s]  Go back up that way.
[6287.87s -> 6288.87s]  You're getting drop-shooted.
[6288.87s -> 6294.53s]  How do I get up there without the jump?
[6294.53s -> 6298.14s]  I wasted all my jump fluid.
[6298.14s -> 6303.92s]  I got to go back to the door.
[6303.92s -> 6311.69s]  How many more levels do I have of this campaign?
[6316.70s -> 6317.70s]  Save the game.
[6317.70s -> 6321.31s]  I did.
[6321.31s -> 6322.31s]  I'm almost at the end.
[6322.31s -> 6323.31s]  Yeah.
[6323.31s -> 6324.31s]  Let me complete this.
[6324.31s -> 6326.77s]  Right?
[6326.77s -> 6329.35s]  I just want to be at one level in blood.
[6329.35s -> 6330.35s]  Come on.
[6330.35s -> 6331.35s]  I need to be at one level in blood.
[6331.35s -> 6334.64s]  Oh, fuck.
[6334.64s -> 6335.64s]  Mom.
[6335.64s -> 6336.64s]  Just one more level.
[6336.64s -> 6342.74s]  I mean, if I'm almost done.
[6342.74s -> 6344.24s]  Come on.
[6344.24s -> 6345.24s]  Come on.
[6345.24s -> 6346.24s]  Come on.
[6346.24s -> 6347.24s]  Come on.
[6347.24s -> 6348.24s]  Come on.
[6348.24s -> 6349.24s]  Come on.
[6349.24s -> 6350.24s]  Come on.
[6350.24s -> 6352.70s]  Come on.
[6352.70s -> 6369.10s]  Come on.
[6369.10s -> 6370.10s]  Come on.
[6370.10s -> 6378.90s]  Come on.
[6378.90s -> 6379.90s]  Come on.
[6379.90s -> 6387.09s]  Come on.
[6387.09s -> 6388.09s]  Come on.
[6388.09s -> 6389.58s]  Come on.
[6389.58s -> 6390.58s]  I mean, if I'm almost done.
[6390.58s -> 6391.58s]  Right?
[6391.58s -> 6397.10s]  I can't just give up and just leave before completing one campaign.
[6397.10s -> 6401.26s]  I need a key.
[6401.26s -> 6402.26s]  Just one level.
[6402.26s -> 6403.26s]  Yeah.
[6403.26s -> 6404.26s]  Just one more.
[6404.26s -> 6405.26s]  I just want to play one level.
[6405.26s -> 6416.49s]  Ooh.
[6416.49s -> 6417.49s]  I got the fire key.
[6417.49s -> 6428.54s]  You're on five out of seven, and seven is really short.
[6428.54s -> 6429.54s]  Yeah.
[6429.54s -> 6430.54s]  Let me down.
[6430.54s -> 6440.80s]  I'm just...
[6440.80s -> 6441.80s]  What's going on here?
[6441.80s -> 6453.33s]  Oh, my God.
[6453.33s -> 6462.76s]  Lord.
[6462.76s -> 6463.76s]  Seven is really short.
[6463.76s -> 6464.76s]  Yeah.
[6464.76s -> 6474.90s]  Let's go.
[6474.90s -> 6475.90s]  Son of a bitch wants pain.
[6475.90s -> 6485.46s]  Get in.
[6485.46s -> 6486.46s]  Get in.
[6486.46s -> 6487.46s]  What's happening here?
[6487.46s -> 6488.46s]  JermaWalk, WobbleDogs, JermaWalk.
[6488.46s -> 6490.98s]  Hold on.
[6490.98s -> 6491.98s]  I'm playing this.
[6491.98s -> 6493.28s]  I don't even know what the fuck just happened.
[6493.28s -> 6501.56s]  Oh, my God.
[6501.56s -> 6502.56s]  Everybody quiet.
[6502.56s -> 6503.56s]  You can't even be fucking si...
[6503.56s -> 6504.56s]  Oh.
[6504.56s -> 6505.56s]  I missed so many of those.
[6505.56s -> 6508.66s]  That was so bad.
[6508.66s -> 6509.66s]  I didn't even run out of bullets.
[6509.66s -> 6510.66s]  Auto-aim.
[6510.66s -> 6511.66s]  No, it's not.
[6511.66s -> 6515.90s]  I'm fine.
[6516.06s -> 6517.06s]  Spider key.
[6517.06s -> 6528.48s]  Let's go.
[6528.48s -> 6529.56s]  What the fuck is happening?
[6529.56s -> 6573.89s]  I don't care about that.
[6573.89s -> 6581.49s]  I just want to get out.
[6581.49s -> 6591.18s]  Let's go.
[6591.18s -> 6598.95s]  You have a doctor bag?
[6598.95s -> 6599.95s]  Moon key.
[6599.95s -> 6600.95s]  I am tearing it up right now.
[6600.95s -> 6604.94s]  I'm being honest with you.
[6604.94s -> 6620.84s]  Is this preparing me for something?
[6620.84s -> 6621.84s]  Let's go.
[6621.84s -> 6644.96s]  I have the...
[6644.96s -> 6645.96s]  I'm not ready.
[6645.96s -> 6646.96s]  I'm ready.
[6646.96s -> 6660.36s]  I'm ready.
[6660.36s -> 6668.45s]  I'm ready.
[6668.45s -> 6669.45s]  I'm ready.
[6669.45s -> 6670.45s]  I'm ready.
[6670.45s -> 6671.45s]  I'm ready.
[6671.45s -> 6678.96s]  I'm ready.
[6678.96s -> 6683.34s]  I'm ready.
[6683.34s -> 6684.34s]  I'm ready.
[6684.34s -> 6685.34s]  I'm ready.
[6685.34s -> 6693.30s]  I'm ready.
[6693.30s -> 6704.01s]  I'm ready.
[6704.01s -> 6724.28s]  I have a maximum amount, can I do double handed?
[6724.28s -> 6725.12s]  Oops.
[6727.52s -> 6728.56s]  What does that do?
[6728.56s -> 6729.94s]  Where am I?
[6729.94s -> 6730.78s]  No, get out of here.
[6734.93s -> 6740.21s]  Shit!
[6740.21s -> 6742.17s]  Dude, you kicking butt right now, dude.
[6744.60s -> 6745.60s]  I can't even.
[6809.83s -> 6813.08s]  Wobble Warriors!
[6813.08s -> 6817.08s]  Oh, Wobble Warriors!
[6817.08s -> 6819.33s]  All right, this is it, guys, we're ready to go.
[6819.33s -> 6833.04s]  Check this out, we're at the fucking final level.
[6833.04s -> 6834.04s]  Six out of seven.
[6834.04s -> 6835.72s]  All right, well, whatever, it's probably not that long.
[6835.72s -> 6840.89s]  I'm fine.
[6840.89s -> 6842.76s]  Hell yeah, look at this.
[6842.80s -> 6844.88s]  Wobble Warriors.
[6844.88s -> 6848.79s]  Wobble Warriors, you're gonna have to wait
[6848.79s -> 6850.35s]  until next weekend.
[6850.35s -> 6856.87s]  No.
[6856.87s -> 6867.31s]  Let me beat this first thing.
[6867.31s -> 6868.15s]  Ophelia.
[6868.15s -> 6872.30s]  No!
[6872.30s -> 6874.32s]  Show yourself.
[6874.32s -> 6877.20s]  Show yourself!
[6877.20s -> 6891.78s]  Oh no, it's Satan!
[6891.78s -> 6912.97s]  God damn it.
[6912.97s -> 6914.37s]  Goodbye.
[6914.37s -> 6918.05s]  Sleep, Ophelia.
[6918.05s -> 6920.85s]  I'm so getting it off me.
[6920.85s -> 6936.06s]  Oh no!
[6936.06s -> 6947.55s]  I thought, he said there was another one.
[6947.55s -> 6964.64s]  Why am I burning this lady?
[6964.64s -> 6979.57s]  He's shooting, he's shooting in the head?
[6986.62s -> 6991.65s]  I feel like that was kind of like made as like a machinima.
[6991.65s -> 6995.04s]  I got it.
[6995.04s -> 6996.95s]  I beat it.
[6996.95s -> 7000.84s]  All right, that was fun.
[7000.84s -> 7002.24s]  So what are we gonna do next?
[7002.24s -> 7006.35s]  This is just like, we're just doing whatever.
[7006.35s -> 7007.43s]  I can't believe you made me watch this.
[7007.43s -> 7008.47s]  That was fun, what are you talking about?
[7008.47s -> 7012.16s]  That was actually fun.
[7012.16s -> 7014.08s]  I very much enjoyed that.
[7014.08s -> 7015.84s]  I mean, I played, I didn't play on hard mode.
[7015.84s -> 7020.81s]  I played on like decent mode, which is fine.
[7020.81s -> 7022.34s]  That's cool.
[7022.34s -> 7027.11s]  Yeah, that was fun, what was it all about?
[7027.11s -> 7029.71s]  That holds up really well considering it came out on DOS.
[7029.71s -> 7034.38s]  This is a DOS game.
[7034.38s -> 7036.98s]  That's a DOS game.
[7036.98s -> 7039.10s]  I'm gonna go pee, I'll be right back.
[7039.14s -> 7042.11s]  And then we'll do something else for like an hour or so.
[7042.11s -> 7044.25s]  Something we can just play, just hang out.
[7044.25s -> 7046.08s]  I'll be right back, let's figure it out.
[7046.08s -> 7077.88s]  Put a poll in chat when I get back, I'll be right back.
[7077.88s -> 7081.72s]  Sorry about that, I just probably scared the shit out of you.
[7081.72s -> 7114.67s]  It was like, dude.
[7114.67s -> 7116.15s]  Oh God, I know what we're doing when I get back.
[7116.15s -> 7116.99s]  Are you kidding me?
[7116.99s -> 7118.64s]  I know exactly what I'm doing.
[7118.64s -> 7120.24s]  I don't even have to question this.
[7120.24s -> 7124.36s]  I'm playing the vampire survivors update without a doubt.
[7124.36s -> 7125.56s]  Yeah, I'll be right back.
