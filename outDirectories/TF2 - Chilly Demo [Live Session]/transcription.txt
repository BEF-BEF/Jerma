[0.31s -> 11.58s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Derma here with some live Dermalicious Man gameplay commentary.
[11.58s -> 23.67s]  Tonight I'm gonna be playing with the new items, the new demo items, because, you know, I haven't really had a chance to sit down with them consecutively, so let's go.
[23.67s -> 32.47s]  So I have to try to like figure out how this stuff works. It's been a week or so since I've played Team Fortress 2, but we're gonna give it a go.
[32.47s -> 41.22s]  So, when I first saw the sticky launcher, I was under the impression that I was probably going to like it, because you just shoot stuff and explode.
[41.22s -> 49.59s]  Shoot stuff and explode. Is that spy dead? I have no idea. Does anybody know if that spy is dead? Can I please hit...
[49.59s -> 57.26s]  You wanna go ham on ham? You wanna go ham on ham? It was a big mistake. You never go ham on ham with a demo.
[57.26s -> 64.57s]  Oh, you were a demo, so don't ever mind. You are a spy. If I've ever seen one, you are a goddamn spy.
[64.57s -> 81.67s]  No, he wasn't. He was a regular player. Look at you. Oh, no, don't. We can't lose. No, you fucker. Oh, I saw that happening too.
[81.67s -> 90.54s]  I legit just watched that happen and didn't do anything about it. I just kind of, my brain turned off and he's gonna get to the point here with crits.
[90.54s -> 97.83s]  Somebody do something about that. Oh, good job. Good job, Pyro. You flamed him. Nice job flaming him.
[97.83s -> 106.02s]  Now we lose. That guy charged on it and we lose. Alright, let's just restock the video. Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[106.02s -> 115.40s]  So, you're probably wondering why we're on cold front, and the answer to that is quite simple. It's really, really cold right now in the northeast.
[115.40s -> 123.42s]  There's like a big cold front passing through, and I figured why not show the implication that it's chilly out.
[123.42s -> 128.73s]  And it's like five degrees, and I'm sure a lot of you guys from really cold areas are probably like, wow, that's nothing.
[128.73s -> 136.03s]  You're telling me you're gonna close schools for like five degree weather? I walked to school in like negative 15.
[136.03s -> 142.37s]  What does this guy think he's doing? Oh, I didn't get anybody. I'm gonna wrap around.
[142.37s -> 149.74s]  I still don't understand this item. This item is like, what, a combination of the lock and load? Should I be treating it like a lock and load or what?
[149.74s -> 155.18s]  It's like lock and load in the default, kind of as one. I'm not even entirely sure how I should be playing with this.
[156.18s -> 160.86s]  But all I know is it's good for stuff like that, because it travels really far.
[160.86s -> 166.73s]  And that's what you should be using it for, at least in my opinion, is to launch stuff really far very quickly.
[166.73s -> 175.80s]  Well, let's try to get this capped. Hey, hey, that's two spies. No, it's not. It's just one. Where'd you go? Show yourself.
[175.80s -> 181.98s]  Give me this health. I don't feel like dying right now. Is he dead? All right, he's dead. We're gonna get this.
[181.98s -> 192.63s]  These rounds are going super, super fast. Yeah, I mean, direct shotting with this thing. Is it as fast as the lock and load? I just don't even know.
[192.63s -> 197.01s]  What the hell do I even know? Got that guy.
[197.01s -> 206.38s]  The one thing I don't like about this new sticky launcher is the point, the point, the thing. Can you say words? Say words.
[206.38s -> 216.33s]  It's not that difficult to produce vocabulary. Do we have a medic? I don't even know. Is the short detonation time?
[216.33s -> 224.38s]  I don't like that. But I guess you kind of have to give up the fact that you're able to shoot things across the map in like less than two seconds like that.
[224.38s -> 230.88s]  So we're gonna wait for this health to spawn. Please spawn. And you are. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry about that.
[230.88s -> 238.38s]  You could have used that health instead. I took it from you. Do we have this many snipers on the team or is that like a spy or something?
[238.38s -> 253.57s]  Get rid of that thing. Where's the medic? There's too many snipers. I keep thinking you're all spies. No, no, no. One more hit.
[253.57s -> 262.33s]  I would have had him. Still got him. I'm good. It's good to go. Good to go. Good to go. Good to go. Not really. Here comes everybody.
[262.33s -> 271.33s]  I should really pull this out. There we go. Oh, I just barely didn't get that guy with the long range shot.
[271.33s -> 281.85s]  Give me a medic. Holy shit. Get me out of there. Let's recharge. We need some health. Give us the health.
[281.85s -> 291.92s]  Oh, damn. Was that a crit screen or did he just get a random crit? Shit. I wanted to. I wanted to win this video game.
[291.92s -> 300.67s]  They got it. Damn it. All right. I got to like set up in my chair. Let's set up in the chair.
[300.67s -> 309.42s]  Let's take a sip of our crystal clear. That guy just lost an uber. Shit. That's no good. Can I stick?
[309.42s -> 316.80s]  I can sticky jump. Yeah, I think so. Right. Yeah. That's a sniper that's going for my. You know what? Screw it.
[316.80s -> 324.62s]  I'm going to use this thing. I like this thing more than the. Holy shit. Did he really just launch that across everything and hit me?
[324.62s -> 334.12s]  Damn it. Now they're going to cap it. No, I didn't. And you know, I didn't even sit up in the chair. That's problem number one.
[334.12s -> 342.46s]  I'm still like slouching back like a fucking sloth. There we go. Now we're sitting up and we're just going to go for this.
[342.46s -> 348.32s]  Let's see if we can get somebody right now. See if that just hit somebody. It did.
[348.32s -> 356.40s]  That's too bad that that didn't kill somebody. That would have been pretty funny. I'll pop it. He popped it. He didn't drop it.
[356.40s -> 364.42s]  That's too bad. And I'm still taking damage of one HP spirit.
[364.42s -> 371.94s]  Spirit of Halloween. No, we're in the middle of January.
[371.94s -> 378.24s]  It's like, what is what is this? Halloween only comes once a year and I would I would accept Halloween
[378.24s -> 385.74s]  anywhere between late September to early November. But in January, that's pushing it and I need health.
[385.74s -> 399.43s]  We're getting just swarmed right now. Oh, my God. I'm using this thing like a shotgun. If I could just hit this medic, that would be fantastic.
[399.43s -> 406.26s]  But I can't actually maybe I can. I'll just babysit up here at least for now until I can get some health.
[406.26s -> 414.77s]  There we go. The spirit of Halloween go through. I just saw a candy pumpkin. That was a candy pumpkin.
[414.77s -> 429.60s]  Oh, my God. You're you're no longer among the living over here. Where the fuck did you come from?
[429.60s -> 438.33s]  Oh, I got a winter crate. I got to do some shit. I'm not doing so well right now.
[438.33s -> 450.62s]  You got to arc these differently, I think. Sort of. You're not getting away with that.
[450.62s -> 462.02s]  Damn it. Come on up here. Come on up here. No, get away with me with that shit.
[462.02s -> 470.62s]  Oh, there's a lot of people coming down there. I need some help. Give me the heals.
[470.62s -> 479.54s]  No, not quite. Not quite through the hall. There are a bunch of people in here now, especially that spy.
[479.54s -> 487.58s]  I don't want that spy to wrap around. Yeah, there he is. Where's he going? Where is he? Right there.
[487.58s -> 498.51s]  Get out of here. Get out of. Damn it. Come on, we got to spawn. We can't lose right here.
[498.51s -> 504.03s]  What's going on? We having like a fucking tea party and spawn, guys? Let's go.
[504.03s -> 509.60s]  And there's a spy that just opened this door because the invisible man.
[509.60s -> 518.56s]  Nobody can open doors like that unless. Holy shit. What do we got here? You.
[518.56s -> 523.70s]  That's a crit. Come on, hit somebody. That didn't hit anybody. It was like three people just standing here.
[523.70s -> 532.36s]  You know, wrap around this way. Well, I got the medic of all people to get.
[532.36s -> 537.92s]  Oh, damn it. You're going to run right into me, aren't you? You didn't think that spy was going to get you.
[537.92s -> 545.05s]  I hit him with two. Can I hit him with that? I'm just going to go for the sniper instead.
[545.05s -> 552.13s]  Screw that guy. Sniper won't even know I'm going to do this because I can shoot at super long range.
[552.13s -> 558.20s]  Good thing I detonated before it even got to anybody. Holy shit. Bye. I didn't even kill him either.
[558.20s -> 567.07s]  I did not even kill him, but I will take credit for it nonetheless.
[567.07s -> 573.79s]  Damn it. I'm so bad with that thing. No, nobody on it. They're all over here.
[573.79s -> 578.70s]  You know, there's definitely a sniper here. Yeah, of course there is.
[578.70s -> 584.58s]  Can't even hit a guy standing still with this thing. Can't even hit a guy standing still.
[584.58s -> 591.37s]  Goodness. OK, well, sort of made up for it. Sort of.
[591.37s -> 599.10s]  You need a medic, don't you? What? What? It's OK.
[599.10s -> 605.86s]  I will take this medic and maybe we can push in. That would be great.
[605.86s -> 614.61s]  That would be fantastic if we could just push in right now. Oh, don't let him get over on that health.
[614.61s -> 620.96s]  You've got to cover all your bases when there's a health thing. You've got to put one here, you've got to put one there, you've got to put one over there.
[620.96s -> 626.10s]  This is not good. OK, well, we've got a team. Whoa, somebody's going to cap it.
[626.10s -> 633.95s]  Somebody was just about to cap it on our team. And we've got a Kritzkrieg.
[633.95s -> 638.94s]  Ooh, a Kritzkrieg. I bet you if you use it, we win.
[638.94s -> 645.04s]  I bet you we win. Oh, my God.
[645.04s -> 652.04s]  I got two people. Perfect timing for me to be good at the game.
[652.04s -> 658.42s]  What's happening? Just, you know, screw it. I'm going for it.
[659.42s -> 663.66s]  I made up for it. I made up for my two kill Kritzkrieg.
[663.66s -> 668.42s]  I did the sticky jump over and got the point. I did it.
[668.42s -> 675.74s]  I just heard a spy decloak. Is that you? That was you.
[675.74s -> 680.44s]  That was you. I got him. OK.
[680.44s -> 685.30s]  Well, OK. So got a spy. Got ourselves a spy there.
[685.30s -> 692.41s]  They're flooding the point right now. Oh, don't stop and drink.
[692.41s -> 696.71s]  Don't stop and drink your fluids, your Gatorade or your Powerade.
[696.71s -> 701.23s]  Whatever the hell you were just drinking. Dear.
[701.23s -> 707.44s]  Nobody there? Nobody there. How are our sentries doing? Good?
[707.44s -> 713.48s]  All right. Well, we only have to push through four points or not lose it.
[713.48s -> 717.30s]  Oh, there we go. There we go. Thanks for the speed boost, dude.
[717.30s -> 720.35s]  We're actually going to push out. Would you look at that?
[720.35s -> 725.11s]  Here comes a scout. I thought he was going to open the door.
[725.11s -> 728.38s]  He kind of is going to open the door, is he?
[728.38s -> 732.19s]  This is what we're talking about here. What we're talking about like long reds, a crit.
[732.19s -> 735.93s]  Was that a crit? How am I not hitting anybody?
[735.93s -> 739.68s]  I can't hit the backside of a fucking barn door.
[739.68s -> 746.63s]  Oh, that's a lot of damage. At least I got somebody.
[746.63s -> 751.89s]  Hopefully it was the heavy. If it wasn't the heavy that...
[751.89s -> 755.74s]  No. Spy. Where is he? Watch out for the spy.
[755.74s -> 762.11s]  Dude, I'm going to wait here because there's no way I can let that happen.
[762.11s -> 765.70s]  Because he will come over here and just sap this thing.
[765.70s -> 770.69s]  I got to give this guy a little bit of protection, at least. At the very least.
[770.69s -> 776.94s]  No, you're real. There's a sniper. Sniper down.
[776.94s -> 782.62s]  That's a lot of people.
[782.62s -> 788.02s]  No, I got him. Let's push out. Push out, boys.
[788.02s -> 790.52s]  We've got places to be. Guy's on the right.
[790.52s -> 798.11s]  Oh, he's still alive. There he goes.
[798.11s -> 802.30s]  What about this guy? Long range.
[802.30s -> 806.11s]  Too bad. Too bad.
[806.11s -> 809.18s]  No, get away from me with that.
[809.18s -> 816.23s]  Now I'm on fire. Heal up.
[816.23s -> 819.23s]  We actually, surprisingly, we were back on our toes there.
[819.23s -> 822.05s]  We're back on our heels.
[822.05s -> 825.54s]  Is that whatever the expression is? Is that even an expression?
[825.54s -> 826.54s]  I don't know. Probably not.
[826.54s -> 830.11s]  We're going to pretend it is, though.
[830.11s -> 834.11s]  And we're going to hope that the spy did not just walk right by my ass.
[834.11s -> 838.38s]  Which he probably did.
[838.38s -> 844.76s]  That scout just almost ate me alive.
[844.76s -> 847.83s]  Here comes the Uber.
[847.83s -> 850.52s]  Don't you even think about it, you two.
[850.52s -> 852.52s]  Die! Did I get the medic?
[852.52s -> 855.27s]  I didn't get the medic. I didn't get the medic.
[855.27s -> 859.90s]  We're in trouble now.
[859.90s -> 862.27s]  We still got the sentries?
[862.27s -> 866.60s]  If we still got those sentries, we'll be in pretty okay shape.
[866.60s -> 868.60s]  But I'm going to assume.
[868.60s -> 871.16s]  That might be enough to prolong this.
[871.16s -> 873.16s]  Oh, no, we got two. We got two. There's one right there.
[873.16s -> 877.22s]  Don't worry about it.
[877.22s -> 878.65s]  Nobody worry.
[878.65s -> 880.65s]  We just got to make sure this heavy medic doesn't roll in here
[880.65s -> 882.65s]  and just destroy everything.
[882.65s -> 886.34s]  I'm going to try to shoot over the heavy and kill the medic.
[886.34s -> 890.22s]  And I was sort of successful.
[890.22s -> 892.39s]  Kind of. I did damage.
[892.39s -> 897.77s]  Don't turn around. Don't turn around.
[897.77s -> 899.65s]  There's nobody behind you.
[899.65s -> 901.65s]  Oh, I should have paid attention behind me.
[901.65s -> 903.65s]  I was too busy hamming people.
[903.65s -> 905.27s]  Oh, well.
[905.27s -> 908.34s]  Shit. Well, that's what happens.
[908.34s -> 910.16s]  I'm going to try one more time.
[910.16s -> 912.16s]  I'm going to go balls to the wall.
[912.16s -> 916.41s]  I'm going to try to just cap it quick.
[916.41s -> 921.81s]  Hashtag cap it quick is what I'm trying to do here.
[921.81s -> 926.26s]  But it's probably going to end in my own death.
[926.26s -> 929.14s]  Considering I didn't do any jumping or anything.
[929.14s -> 931.14s]  I didn't like sticky jump or anything.
[931.14s -> 934.60s]  But here we go. Cap it quick.
[934.60s -> 937.76s]  Middle point.
[937.76s -> 940.73s]  We got a couple of people going about.
[940.73s -> 941.73s]  Oh, we got. Here we go.
[941.73s -> 944.18s]  Here we go.
[944.18s -> 946.32s]  All right, we got two or three down.
[946.32s -> 948.32s]  Two or three down. What we got? One Demoman?
[948.32s -> 950.01s]  Where's he at?
[950.01s -> 953.17s]  There we go.
[953.17s -> 955.17s]  No, not quite.
[955.17s -> 957.50s]  You bastard.
[957.50s -> 958.50s]  You just killed my medic.
[958.50s -> 959.50s]  We're going to cap it.
[959.50s -> 960.50s]  We just got it.
[960.50s -> 962.12s]  Oh, my God.
[962.12s -> 963.12s]  Hashtag cap it quick.
[963.12s -> 964.12s]  It's actually a thing.
[964.12s -> 965.62s]  No.
[965.62s -> 966.62s]  Shit.
[966.62s -> 967.62s]  Cap it quick.
[967.62s -> 968.62s]  Yes.
[968.62s -> 971.39s]  You see what happened?
[971.39s -> 974.39s]  See what happens when you use a hashtag in a game?
[974.39s -> 976.40s]  You got to write it.
[976.40s -> 977.40s]  You got to know what's going to be written.
[977.40s -> 981.16s]  Hashtag cap it quick.
