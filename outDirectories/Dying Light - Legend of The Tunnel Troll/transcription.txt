[253.12s -> 260.19s]  There's a fucking zombie up here. Hold on. Don't, don't do anything to him. How would you have ever
[260.19s -> 266.27s]  made it up here? She doesn't even have a arm. This zombie is armed, one armed climbed up here.
[266.27s -> 280.50s]  Are you telling me that's what happened? No way. What if she got up and just climbed back up?

[319.06s -> 325.54s]  machine. As you see here, my lovely assistant head on through and I'll see you in the year 1900.
[328.05s -> 331.14s]  Oh, that's not as funny as I thought it was going to be.
[339.28s -> 345.68s]  Hey, it's okay. Are you all right, sir? Hey, you just dropped like 10,000 feet. I'm glad you're

[402.54s -> 408.86s]  do. All right. What if I like start to start to fall and can I grab it? Maybe? No, I wouldn't do
[408.86s -> 415.10s]  it that way. Go for it. Look what I did. You want to talk about like falling and grabbing onto
[415.10s -> 425.28s]  something? Wow, Joe is the master of falling. I'm fucking the man. Back to square one. Everyone,
[425.28s -> 432.88s]  I want all the actors. That's no shit. No, dude. Just wait. Just wait like 30 seconds. Yeah. Guess
[432.88s -> 442.98s]  what? They're gonna come on. No, get the fuck out of here. Run, run, run.
