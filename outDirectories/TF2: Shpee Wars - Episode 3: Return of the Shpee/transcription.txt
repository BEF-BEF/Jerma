[2.10s -> 38.83s]  Alright, pretty good defense down here. This is looking pretty good. Pyro, maybe trying
[38.83s -> 51.49s]  to help a little bit. Thank you so much. You would have backstabbed me. Now, let's go
[51.49s -> 66.31s]  fight. The enemies are going to come from over here. Follow me. Turn left. No, you didn't
[66.31s -> 73.79s]  turn left. Come back up the stairs. Go back up the stairs. Oh shit. I think I startled
[73.79s -> 79.55s]  them. I scared them. It's okay. Calm down. Calm down. It's okay. Don't worry. It's okay.
[79.55s -> 93.33s]  Calm down. Oh shit. Oh shit. I don't want to lose this. I'm going to have to use this.
[93.33s -> 100.65s]  I can't go anywhere. Alright, come on, Shmee. Do something. Go out there and stab somebody.
[100.65s -> 117.33s]  Oh my god. You're kidding me right now. Why did you do that? Baby Shmee again drops the
[117.33s -> 155.70s]  ball in the fucking end zone. No, you go. I like you. No, you go. I like you. No, you
[156.70s -> 166.69s]  go. Watch out now. Watch out now. Watch out. Get along now. Well, let me take care of that
[166.69s -> 191.13s]  for you. Whoops. What is this guy doing? I'm just like target practice with this guy right
[191.13s -> 205.55s]  out. He's going to get it eventually. Oh no, he's gone. He's like, oh shit. There's a Pyro.
[206.79s -> 228.97s]  Oh, that was awesome. What the fuck is this guy really seriously doing? Red Heavy. Red Heavy,
[228.97s -> 237.09s]  I'm going to come out disguise. I need help. Shmee. Okay. Hi. Where do I spread? To wrap this
[237.09s -> 242.33s]  video up, I just want to say one more public service announcement about the species and how
[242.33s -> 247.73s]  we can protect them. Please donate to your local Shpee foundation. My favorite is the
[247.73s -> 255.90s]  species are we and the species are we and it was like watching that I like can't even do the
[255.90s -> 257.78s]  outro. Anyways, good night everybody.
