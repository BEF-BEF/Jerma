[0.31s -> 14.44s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[14.44s -> 24.44s]  And tonight, gonna be playing as the Soldier with the original, the default shotgun and the strange equalizer.
[24.44s -> 26.44s]  There you go, I almost got those two mixed up.
[26.44s -> 32.62s]  And yes, I have a cold again. Again. I don't know what it is, but it's definitely from coming back from California.
[32.62s -> 39.62s]  And all the craziness that happened the last week. And of course the pollen here, so yes, I am sick again.
[39.62s -> 47.62s]  And I could probably explain why I get sick more often than I should, but that is a tale for a different time.
[47.62s -> 51.62s]  But I'll give you this. I take immunosuppressants for my Crohn's disease.
[51.62s -> 55.62s]  And that's kind of the reason why I get more sick. So we'll leave it at that.
[55.62s -> 62.29s]  But anyways, I have a custom HUD now. A lot of you are probably wondering, a lot of the old subscribers,
[62.29s -> 67.46s]  if you have been on this channel since day one, I've never had a custom HUD. Ever.
[67.46s -> 74.46s]  For any reason, I've only used the default and I've made the minimal HUD. I checked the minimal HUD box and the advanced options.
[74.46s -> 79.90s]  But I've never downloaded and installed a custom HUD. And I really don't know why.
[79.90s -> 84.90s]  I don't know why I take so long to do these things. It took me forever to turn on fast weapon switch.
[84.90s -> 89.90s]  Took me forever to turn on the damage indicators even, the sound indicators.
[89.90s -> 94.90s]  And I mean, I've been playing this game since beta, since TF2 beta. And I don't know. I don't know why.
[94.90s -> 100.07s]  I can't tell you a reason why. But now that I've done it, I will never go back.
[100.07s -> 106.07s]  These custom HUDs, they are so much better. They just free up the screen. You can see much more of what's going on.
[106.07s -> 111.07s]  It's much more minimal, much more condensed. And if you want the link to the one that I'm using right now,
[111.07s -> 115.07s]  it will be in the description. And it's courtesy of Star.
[115.07s -> 120.38s]  I think Star told me this is a mix of Garmin HUD and something else.
[120.38s -> 125.62s]  I don't remember what it was. But I think he made it. I think he screwed around with it and did some settings.
[125.62s -> 131.62s]  But there's a link to Star's HUD, which is now my HUD. So thank you, Star. I appreciate it.
[131.62s -> 136.86s]  And I'm going to use this till the day I die. Unless, of course, I find something better,
[136.86s -> 142.86s]  which leads me into the kind of question of the video. What HUD do you guys use?
[142.86s -> 147.86s]  And what HUD do you recommend? Because I know there are a million Team Fortress 2 HUDs.
[147.86s -> 153.86s]  There's PV HUD, Eve HUD, Franken HUD, Burger Boy HUD, Burger Boy HUD 2.
[153.86s -> 156.86s]  I mean, there are so many HUDs. Those last two don't exist, by the way.
[156.86s -> 160.86s]  But there are so many HUDs in this game that it can really become overwhelming.
[160.86s -> 164.86s]  And I think that's one of the reasons why I never tried. Because I heard of all these HUDs.
[164.86s -> 169.86s]  Let me download this one. Oh, this one. Which one do I even want? And they all look pretty different.
[169.86s -> 176.16s]  So I think that's one of the reasons why I never did it. But now I have jumped into the custom HUD glory.
[176.16s -> 180.91s]  And I'm ready to try. So now I want to talk about the gameplay for a minute or two.
[180.91s -> 184.91s]  I want to talk about the original because in the entirety of this channel,
[184.91s -> 190.91s]  there's only been one other discussion or one other video talking about the original or even showing the original.
[190.91s -> 194.09s]  But what I want to talk about is rocket jumping with this thing.
[194.09s -> 198.33s]  Now, I am not a pro rocket jumper by any means, but I do know the basics.
[198.33s -> 202.33s]  I've done jump maps before. I know how to do general rocket jumping.
[202.33s -> 205.33s]  I know the mechanics. I know how to wallbang and stuff like that.
[205.33s -> 209.57s]  But because the rockets in the original come right out of the middle of the screen,
[209.57s -> 214.57s]  you have to overcompensate a little bit when you try to do a turn crouch jump forward jump.
[214.57s -> 219.57s]  And it really launches you a lot higher than you would go forward, if that makes any sense at all.
[219.57s -> 225.94s]  But in condensed terms, you're pretty much shooting at your toes rather than at the ground behind you.
[225.94s -> 230.37s]  And there's a pretty good example of this happening. I think it's in like 30 seconds or so.
[230.37s -> 235.37s]  I try to jump over those two cargo train things that are on the middle of the point.
[235.37s -> 238.37s]  And instead, I just go straight in the air and land kind of straight down.
[238.37s -> 243.37s]  And that's not what I intended. But of course, I'm using the original. So that's why that happened.
[243.37s -> 248.99s]  But of course, it comes down to using the item and getting used to it.
[248.99s -> 253.99s]  I had a video go up about the Liberty launcher not that long ago talking about the rocket speed
[253.99s -> 257.99s]  and how going back and forth between different rocket launchers can really screw with your muscle memory.
[257.99s -> 260.99s]  But that's something you need to work on. That's something you have to pick.
[260.99s -> 266.30s]  You got to just go with it and you got to try it. But that is going to wrap up this video, guys.
[266.30s -> 268.30s]  Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[268.30s -> 273.30s]  And again, leave me a comment on this video telling me what your favorite HUD is,
[273.30s -> 277.30s]  because I'm probably just going to download all of them and then install them one right after the other
[277.30s -> 282.30s]  to see which one I like the best. So I mean, that might take a little while, but I'm willing to try it.
[282.30s -> 288.30s]  So anyways, guys, thank you again. I will see you all soon. And take care, everybody.
