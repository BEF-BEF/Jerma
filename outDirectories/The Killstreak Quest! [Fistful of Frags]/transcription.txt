[0.31s -> 19.01s]  Howdy, partners. It's me, Jerma, here with a Fistful of Frags gameplay live compo.
[19.01s -> 21.01s]  I just was getting started.
[21.01s -> 25.57s]  Whiskey. Pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, a whiskey, pass, a whiskey.
[25.57s -> 31.43s]  For the love of all that is sacred.
[31.43s -> 40.27s]  I want to go in like a at least five kill streak right now. Have to. Got to. It's mandatory. It's absolutely mandatory.
[40.27s -> 45.69s]  It is mandatory.
[45.69s -> 49.31s]  This guy's got two weapons. There we go. It's three.
[49.31s -> 51.31s]  Oh! Coming from behind.
[51.31s -> 55.07s]  Had a bullet on that.
[55.07s -> 58.07s]  Let me get that one more hit. Oh boy. Oh boy, I'm in trouble.
[58.07s -> 60.95s]  This is actually a good place to be.
[60.95s -> 63.83s]  I can sit in here and I can reload the gun.
[63.83s -> 66.83s]  Don't have to really worry about anyone coming through. There's some whiskey on the ground.
[66.83s -> 72.23s]  Dude, I don't want to be that drunk for this.
[72.23s -> 74.23s]  Because it sounds like there's a lot going on out here.
[74.23s -> 78.16s]  I've got to get to like at least five or six kills.
[78.16s -> 80.85s]  And this guy doesn't even know.
[80.85s -> 82.85s]  Oh, you don't even know.
[88.10s -> 91.10s]  Just creeping in the room like friggin' Slenderman.
[91.10s -> 94.49s]  I'm at four. Ready to bang.
[94.49s -> 96.49s]  Oh, that was close.
[96.49s -> 98.49s]  That was close. Show your face again.
[98.49s -> 100.49s]  Did I get him? Oh, I did get him.
[100.49s -> 102.49s]  This is five.
[103.49s -> 105.92s]  Oh boy, this is bad. This is bad.
[105.92s -> 106.92s]  This is real bad.
[106.92s -> 110.92s]  People around all over the place. I got to make this shot count. This shot has to count.
[110.92s -> 112.92s]  It counted. It counted. I got it.
[112.92s -> 115.92s]  It counted. Oh my god, that guy didn't even see me.
[115.92s -> 118.16s]  How did that guy not see me?
[118.16s -> 120.59s]  I don't know. I'm not going to ask questions.
[120.59s -> 122.83s]  But I'm going to try to keep this going.
[122.83s -> 124.01s]  There it is.
[124.01s -> 127.50s]  Give me that gun. Give me this thing. No, I don't want this thing.
[127.50s -> 130.74s]  I want to stay with the pistol. I want to stay tried and true with the pistol.
[130.74s -> 132.05s]  Try to get to ten.
[132.05s -> 134.05s]  No!
[135.05s -> 146.35s]  Must pay attention to your surroundings, son.
[146.35s -> 151.94s]  Pay attention to your surroundings.
[151.94s -> 155.50s]  Pay attention to your surroundings.
[155.50s -> 157.94s]  Let's go with the...
[157.94s -> 161.07s]  No. I'm going to try to do this.
[161.07s -> 163.87s]  It's very important.
[163.87s -> 168.71s]  There is a dynamite behind me.
[168.71s -> 170.71s]  Guy throwing dynamite up top right there.
[170.71s -> 172.71s]  Seriously, you got to get out of my face.
[172.71s -> 177.22s]  Four.
[177.22s -> 180.22s]  The quest for the ten kill streak.
[180.22s -> 184.13s]  It is a quest indeed.
[184.13s -> 187.13s]  Especially on a free for all map.
[187.13s -> 191.43s]  It's difficult to do because people could be seriously all over you.
[191.43s -> 193.43s]  In every single direction.
[193.43s -> 196.95s]  Let's get out here in this room.
[196.95s -> 200.95s]  It's so scary because if you turn a corner and there's somebody just sitting there and they're ready before you're ready.
[200.95s -> 203.70s]  Sayonara.
[203.70s -> 205.70s]  You ain't going to make it.
[205.70s -> 206.70s]  Like that.
[206.70s -> 208.70s]  That's exactly what I was talking about.
[208.70s -> 210.97s]  What happened to my kill streak?
[210.97s -> 214.40s]  I don't even know what this is. I was on like four. Why does it say three?
[214.40s -> 217.66s]  Well, I don't believe that at all.
[217.66s -> 221.42s]  So I like lost pace.
[221.42s -> 223.42s]  Hopefully this is like at least eight.
[223.42s -> 224.42s]  I hope.
[224.42s -> 229.15s]  I don't know how many kills this is.
[229.15s -> 233.58s]  I've lost track. It's like seven or eight. I don't know, but I need ten.
[233.58s -> 235.58s]  Got to get to that ten.
[238.95s -> 239.95s]  All right. All right.
[239.95s -> 241.95s]  Just calm down. Calm down.
[241.95s -> 244.95s]  Calm down and whip a knife at this guy.
[244.95s -> 248.28s]  Oh, I'm in trouble.
[248.28s -> 249.28s]  I'm in trouble.
[249.28s -> 251.28s]  This could be ten here.
[251.28s -> 253.65s]  Oh, no.
[253.65s -> 256.65s]  No, I was at nine.
[256.65s -> 260.36s]  I can clean this up.
[260.36s -> 262.97s]  I'm going to clean this shit up.
[262.97s -> 264.97s]  Somebody call Billy Mays.
[264.97s -> 266.97s]  Tell him to bring all of his oxy clean.
[266.97s -> 268.97s]  Because this place is a fucking mess.
[268.97s -> 271.27s]  It needs like a deep clean.
[271.27s -> 274.92s]  Hide, hide, hide from this guy.
[274.92s -> 276.92s]  Holy shit.
[276.92s -> 277.92s]  What is happening?
[277.92s -> 279.92s]  Shoot the guy next to you.
[279.92s -> 282.99s]  You dipshits.
[282.99s -> 285.99s]  What the fuck is going on in that room, dude?
[285.99s -> 287.99s]  Look at everybody's in this room.
[287.99s -> 290.99s]  Every single person was just in this room.
[290.99s -> 293.99s]  Why is so many people in here?
[293.99s -> 301.33s]  Oh, I had to be quiet for that one.
[301.33s -> 306.08s]  There's no way I was going to do that one while opening my big mouth.
[306.08s -> 311.24s]  My big mouth.
[311.24s -> 318.60s]  If they go for a kick, just do the reverse kick.
[318.60s -> 320.60s]  God, the derringers are so scary.
[320.60s -> 322.60s]  I was so scared to use these things.
[322.60s -> 324.60s]  You get two shots at each side and if you miss, it's over.
[324.60s -> 326.60s]  You get four, but you know what I'm saying.
[326.60s -> 329.29s]  You understand.
[329.29s -> 333.06s]  You understand my stress.
[333.06s -> 338.44s]  I'm under a lot of stress with the derringers.
[338.44s -> 339.44s]  Was that three?
[339.44s -> 341.19s]  Was that three?
[341.19s -> 342.37s]  All right.
[342.37s -> 343.37s]  Cool.
[343.37s -> 347.59s]  Just leave me alone for a second.
[347.59s -> 349.90s]  I'm just trying to reload.
[349.90s -> 352.90s]  I'm just trying to reload for crying out loud.
[352.90s -> 353.90s]  Is that a grenade?
[353.90s -> 354.90s]  Oh, not a grenade.
[354.90s -> 355.90s]  A dynamite?
[355.90s -> 358.34s]  I don't know.
[358.34s -> 363.34s]  But we're going to one of the worst parts to go to because it's just out in the open.
[363.34s -> 364.34s]  I missed.
[364.34s -> 367.47s]  I missed again.
[367.47s -> 368.47s]  Okay.
[368.47s -> 369.47s]  Okay.
[369.47s -> 371.61s]  Chill.
[371.61s -> 373.61s]  Getting close here.
[373.61s -> 376.26s]  Seriously.
[376.26s -> 377.26s]  Fuck you, dude.
[377.26s -> 378.26s]  Where are the derringers?
[378.26s -> 379.82s]  I got to shoot.
[379.82s -> 382.27s]  I got to hit this.
[382.27s -> 384.27s]  Get that dynamite out of my face, bro.
[384.27s -> 386.83s]  Get it out of my face.
[386.83s -> 391.36s]  I'm in so much trouble.
[391.36s -> 392.36s]  Seriously, I need whiskey.
[392.36s -> 394.36s]  Otherwise, there's no way I'm going to get to 10.
[394.36s -> 396.92s]  I don't even want to open that box.
[396.92s -> 401.61s]  I'm too timid right now to do anything besides just like chill.
[401.61s -> 405.13s]  Someone's going to hit me from afar.
[405.13s -> 406.13s]  It's going to happen.
[406.13s -> 407.13s]  It just is.
[407.13s -> 409.13s]  Accept your fate.
[409.13s -> 411.71s]  I'm freaking out.
[411.71s -> 413.46s]  I'm freaking out right now.
[413.46s -> 415.47s]  I'm freaking out.
[415.47s -> 419.98s]  Oh my God.
[419.98s -> 420.98s]  I killed him.
[420.98s -> 421.98s]  Give me the whiskey.
[421.98s -> 423.28s]  Come on.
[423.28s -> 425.42s]  I just like...
[425.42s -> 426.42s]  No.
[426.42s -> 427.42s]  I was at eight.
[427.42s -> 428.42s]  Fucker.
[428.42s -> 429.42s]  One more.
[429.42s -> 430.42s]  Come on.
[430.42s -> 437.93s]  That guy's got like two health.
[437.93s -> 442.68s]  I wasted three shots on that guy and I'm not even going to get the kill for it.
[442.68s -> 443.68s]  Where am I?
[443.68s -> 445.88s]  I am.
[445.88s -> 446.88s]  Box crate is here.
[446.88s -> 448.12s]  Nobody around.
[448.12s -> 449.30s]  Give it to me quick.
[449.30s -> 451.05s]  Come on.
[451.05s -> 452.05s]  Before somebody comes in the room.
[452.05s -> 453.86s]  Pump shotgun.
[453.86s -> 455.81s]  Give it to me.
[455.81s -> 458.20s]  Let's get this done.
[458.20s -> 460.20s]  Let's get this 10 kill streak done.
[460.20s -> 461.20s]  What do you say?
[461.20s -> 463.78s]  What do you say?
[463.78s -> 464.78s]  Huh?
[464.78s -> 467.69s]  What do you say, mate?
[467.69s -> 468.69s]  Let's go.
[468.69s -> 470.12s]  What do you say?
[470.12s -> 475.18s]  I'm going to do it.
[475.18s -> 477.18s]  I'm going to do it right here.
[477.18s -> 483.27s]  I don't care where you come from, you snakes.
[483.27s -> 484.27s]  Just like a snake.
[484.27s -> 485.27s]  You got to get a couple kills and you got to jump away.
[485.27s -> 487.27s]  You got to take a way back to your home.
[487.27s -> 491.64s]  I would open this, but I don't want to because I want to be sure that I'm going to get this
[491.64s -> 492.64s]  streak.
[492.64s -> 494.84s]  Go back to my snake den.
[494.84s -> 497.74s]  And I see bodies.
[497.74s -> 498.74s]  Fresh bodies.
[498.74s -> 499.74s]  Yep.
[499.74s -> 500.74s]  Fresh bodies.
[500.74s -> 501.74s]  Fresh bodies.
[501.74s -> 504.14s]  That's all right.
[504.14s -> 505.14s]  That's all right.
[505.14s -> 506.31s]  That's all right.
[506.31s -> 508.31s]  I had a little bit of a freak out moment there, guys.
[508.31s -> 510.49s]  A little bit of a freak out moment.
[510.49s -> 513.92s]  Because I'm real close to that big 1-0.
[513.92s -> 516.57s]  Give me that whiskey.
[516.57s -> 518.00s]  Give me that heavily, heavily.
[518.00s -> 519.00s]  I don't think it matters.
[519.00s -> 520.00s]  It's not going to matter.
[520.00s -> 521.00s]  I need to get a couple more kills here.
[521.00s -> 524.22s]  Oh, there's a guy.
[524.22s -> 525.22s]  There's a guy.
[525.22s -> 526.22s]  There it is.
[526.22s -> 528.87s]  I think I got it.
[528.87s -> 529.87s]  I have no idea, though.
[529.87s -> 530.87s]  I have absolutely no idea if I got it or not.
[530.87s -> 531.87s]  Is the kill streak quest over?
[531.87s -> 532.87s]  I hope so.
[532.87s -> 533.87s]  I hope so.
[533.87s -> 534.87s]  Because I really...
[534.87s -> 536.94s]  Let's get it to 15.
[536.94s -> 537.94s]  I did it.
[537.94s -> 540.02s]  I did it.
[540.02s -> 541.38s]  I got it.
[541.38s -> 542.82s]  I got it.
[542.82s -> 544.18s]  I got it.
[544.18s -> 545.18s]  I got it.
[545.18s -> 547.26s]  I got it.
[547.26s -> 548.26s]  I did it.
[548.26s -> 549.26s]  I did it.
[549.26s -> 550.26s]  I got it.
[550.26s -> 551.26s]  I got it.
[551.26s -> 552.56s]  I got it.
[552.56s -> 553.56s]  I got it.
[553.56s -> 554.99s]  Hands up.
[554.99s -> 555.99s]  I got it.
[555.99s -> 556.99s]  Ten.
[556.99s -> 557.99s]  Low left.
[557.99s -> 558.99s]  Kill streak quest is complete.
[558.99s -> 560.30s]  And that's going to wrap it up.
[560.30s -> 561.30s]  That's what I wanted to do.
[561.30s -> 562.30s]  That was the goal.
[562.30s -> 563.30s]  That was what I set out to accomplish.
[563.30s -> 564.47s]  And I did.
[564.47s -> 565.47s]  And yeah, a fistful of frags, guys.
[565.47s -> 566.47s]  By the way, hold down alt for those of you that are wondering.
[566.47s -> 567.47s]  Hold on.
[567.47s -> 569.03s]  What the fucking...
[569.03s -> 570.03s]  All right, hold down alt.
[570.03s -> 571.03s]  That's the tip.
[571.03s -> 572.03s]  That's the strategy for the day.
[572.03s -> 573.03s]  It makes your aim better.
[573.03s -> 574.03s]  All right.
[574.03s -> 575.03s]  Take care, everybody.
[575.03s -> 575.05s]  Goodbye.
