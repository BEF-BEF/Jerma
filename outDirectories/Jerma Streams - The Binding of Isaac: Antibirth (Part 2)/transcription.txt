[0.95s -> 16.26s]  Hello, what's going on? How are you? Wait, somebody said, you know, it's bad if he's playing Isaac.
[17.96s -> 23.08s]  What does that mean? Oh man, you know, it's bad if he's playing Isaac.
[24.86s -> 27.42s]  I'll give you, we'll talk about this for just a quick second.
[29.00s -> 37.34s]  Oh, let me, let me, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[37.34s -> 43.51s]  There we go, I had to tweet it. I'm not even here. Just, just watch the fucking...
[45.67s -> 97.19s]  I'll be, I'll be back in like a minute. So Kristen goes to the grocery store
[97.19s -> 112.17s]  and she buys 15 apples. She trades those apples to David for 40 bananas. Those 40 bananas are
[112.17s -> 118.81s]  then turned into a banana puree and put on top of a cake, which is then sold for $100.
[119.93s -> 145.46s]  What was her first name? Yeah, I got you. I got fucked over from that one like a few hours ago.
[145.46s -> 150.82s]  I got fucked over from that one. It was like, oh, how about he and times two minus that. It was
[150.82s -> 161.94s]  like, oh, what, what was their name? Oh fuck. It was Jen. They got you guys too. Yeah, so today
[164.81s -> 167.69s]  I'm going to play Isaac today. I did say I was going to play it yesterday.
[168.41s -> 172.78s]  I also said I wanted to play city skylines, but I'll be honest with you,
[174.38s -> 179.00s]  kind of hurting today. So I figured I would just sit back for a little bit and play
[179.88s -> 188.78s]  something that I know how to do and just chill for a little bit. So, uh, took some Advil.
[188.78s -> 196.89s]  Just going to hang out. Oh no, fuck it. For those of you, I'm not like sick. For those of you that
[196.89s -> 203.61s]  are like, wait, what are you talking about? What? Why are you taking Advil? Uh, no, it's my back and
[203.61s -> 209.13s]  chest and shit, but I'll be all right for a little while. I just wanted to get that out there. So
[209.13s -> 213.77s]  city skylines, is it going to be the first thing we do? And I figured let's just do a whole stream
[213.77s -> 220.33s]  on it rather than try to do like two hours of Isaac, three hours, and then like go through like
[220.33s -> 229.77s]  four hours of city skylines. I'd rather just do a full stream on it. Maybe a few of them, but
[230.57s -> 235.93s]  that's the next thing we're going to do. But I do want to stream today and I do want to play Isaac.
[236.73s -> 241.48s]  So that's what we're going to do because I can't reliably tell you how long I'm going to be able
[241.48s -> 248.10s]  to sit here for. I'm going to be 1000% honest. I don't think this is going to be an eight hour
[248.10s -> 257.43s]  stream. No, I don't, not like last time. So without further ado, did I, did I tweet this shit?
[261.78s -> 275.69s]  I'd be very surprised. I would be very surprised. I'll go as long as I can. I don't know. This,
[275.69s -> 282.62s]  this whole thing's been like flaring up like crazy. It's like the last like three weeks,
[282.62s -> 289.37s]  it's just been like, fuck, I've also been doing like physical therapy. Maybe I'm like,
[289.37s -> 296.55s]  I've aggravated it and it's like, just maybe, I don't know. But anyways, I'm going to do anti-birth.
[296.55s -> 305.16s]  I'm going to try to actually beat the fucking boss of this game. I mean, I'm going to try to
[305.16s -> 312.28s]  beat the actual encounter. Oh, he's aggravated. Take it easy. Don't hide. Don't worry. I'm fine.
[313.21s -> 318.81s]  I am fine. Why I'm telling you already this, if it gets to the point like it already happened this
[318.81s -> 329.18s]  week, I'll just, I'll just call it, right? And we'll try again. I'm open. So let's go. Binding of
[329.26s -> 337.80s]  Isaac. Ooh, I just hit you. Where am I going to put my cheat sheet over here? That fits over there.
[337.80s -> 344.73s]  Watch out for the game cube disks. There we go. All right. Web cams not on, right? No. Okay.
[344.73s -> 352.38s]  I don't have any fucking clothes on. He doesn't want us to worry. No, don't worry.
[354.09s -> 360.06s]  Do not worry about me. Don't worry about me. Don't do it. Don't do it. Now, who do I want to play
[360.06s -> 365.80s]  with? And you guys have to help me here because seriously, I'm going to forget about the fire
[365.80s -> 371.46s]  shit. I'm going to forget about the puzzle stuff. I'm going to do Judas. What do you want me to
[371.46s -> 387.34s]  start with? I fucking love this game. I'm obsessed with this game. Just do random. Use mods that,
[387.34s -> 394.42s]  oh, this is a mod. This is Andy birth. There are other mods for Isaac. Random, random, random.
[394.42s -> 406.63s]  How do you do random? Oh, there it is. All right. Here we go. Actually spins a wheel. Oh,
[406.63s -> 419.43s]  god damn it. All right. Fucking Azazel. Really? Okay. Let's go. Do I really want to play as
[419.43s -> 429.96s]  Azazel right now? No. Azazel. Okay. I need, I need a warmup though. I need one warmup round.
[431.14s -> 437.80s]  Uh, this, this is not the, the, is how was it pronounced? Yeah. I need a warmup round.
[438.44s -> 445.02s]  Free lemonade. Yeah. Azazel is not the character you play when you warm it up. Azazel is the
[445.02s -> 450.42s]  character you play, but you're like, I fucking played like six rounds already. I'm not ready
[450.42s -> 456.95s]  to go off, like kill everything in one second. How do you pronounce it? It's a steam workshop mods.
[457.51s -> 474.74s]  What does this lemonade do? Azazel. Azazel. It's Azazel. Well, what did I say? Azazel.
[475.30s -> 489.51s]  I kind of like mine better. Don't you? Extra lemonade, whatever. All right. This is that.
[489.51s -> 495.59s]  This is, this is a delete. That's like, I got one heart. I think this is a delete scenario.
[501.14s -> 510.22s]  Have it your way. Did somebody just say the Burger King jingle? Hey dude, have it your way.
[513.59s -> 519.19s]  He's dying with Azazel. I'm warming up. It's a warmup round. Don't you know?
[519.91s -> 527.24s]  Now I gotta, there's a window here that's causing some kind of lag for some reason.
[527.24s -> 532.39s]  Don't ask me why. What's going on here? All right. My cheat sheets open in an iPad window.
[534.86s -> 544.94s]  All right. What else, what do I got? I'm going down here. He's already making excuses.
[545.90s -> 552.55s]  Yeah. That's what I, and I, I can do that. I can make excuses. I can say, nah, it's fucking
[552.55s -> 556.31s]  things. Fucking doesn't even work. Like I could say anything I want. I could tell you that my
[556.31s -> 562.07s]  control is broken. Like I could tell you that the analog of my thumb just came off when I died.
[562.07s -> 567.67s]  Like, oh, I died. Oh, fuck dude. My analog just came off and I have a dummy analog stick here and
[567.67s -> 573.48s]  I can put it on camera and people be like, oh fuck. I guess his analog fucking came off. That's
[573.48s -> 578.34s]  fucked up. I've never heard of that before. I don't ever trust anything anyone ever tells you,
[579.56s -> 596.76s]  especially me. Always, always lying. Fuck what a wash this is. Not yet. Not yet. Not a wash yet.
[596.76s -> 609.40s]  Okay. I'll just open it. Let's go. Ooh, good. Uh, those of you that have no idea what's going on,
[609.40s -> 616.55s]  this is, this is anti-birth. This is not the regular mining advisor. Do we have any tinted rocks?
[616.55s -> 623.43s]  I haven't, nobody's been spamming tinted rocks. I haven't seen a single
[623.43s -> 641.13s]  tinted rock spam. There's one back to the left because I got five bombs, two stone and one tint.
[641.69s -> 651.93s]  I don't think there is any. No, somebody would have been like, dude, it's in room A7. Be like,
[651.93s -> 667.11s]  oh fuck, right. What the fuck does this lemonade even do? I haven't even tried to use it. It just
[667.11s -> 672.90s]  makes you pee. I'm going to try. I'm using this next room. Nevermind. Wait, lightning. Oh shit.
[673.70s -> 690.50s]  Fuck it. Throwers. Come on Azazel. No, that's just that. Okay. Rock. Oh fuck. Not a lie. Okay. I
[690.50s -> 699.86s]  gotta start listening to you guys every day. All right. This is not over yet. The next one is two
[699.86s -> 717.77s]  bombs, right? You should listen to us. He needs to listen to us more often. I do. You're right.
[717.77s -> 723.61s]  What are these? Yeah, but I'm Azazel though. Like none of the cool items do anything with Azazel.
[724.25s -> 731.37s]  That's like the super tier, right? Left, left, left, left.
[732.60s -> 743.42s]  Mega tiers. Does that work with Azazel? Look at how long this takes to charge. One, two, three.
[743.42s -> 752.02s]  Oh my god. That's a shitload of damage, but I'm not going to be able to attack anything. All right.
[752.02s -> 773.85s]  I gotta queue it up before I go into every room. Oh, for the love of... God damn it, man. The hard
[773.85s -> 784.47s]  counter. Fuck. That sucked. Do I have any hearts? Look at the damage though. It's so good.
[788.06s -> 799.51s]  Fuck. Oh, it's so long. It's so long. I've melt bosses. I just gotta stay alive.
[806.23s -> 814.81s]  Yeah, he's right. Just go with a sad face. Damn it. There's no spirit hearts in here. I thought
[814.81s -> 839.21s]  that was going to be... Just go. Just go. Get the pill? This is going to be like tiers down
[839.21s -> 842.60s]  and it's going to ruin the whole run. If this is tiers down, I'm going to reset.
[843.32s -> 860.10s]  Ooh, what's this? Talus. Your feet feels... Oh, I can walk over spikes, right? So this thing does.
[860.66s -> 872.82s]  Okay, let's go. All right. It's useless. Bomb the left. Going to bomb over here. That could be the
[872.90s -> 888.50s]  secret room. You're right. You could literally fly. Right. Right. I can literally fly. All right.
[888.50s -> 900.58s]  Don't use all these bombs when I need this shit. Imagine being able to fly and buying fucking...
[902.84s -> 920.38s]  God damn it. I'm so dumb. All right. Beasel bub. Okay. Well, that was fun. HP up. That was... Okay.
[920.38s -> 926.65s]  This could work out pretty well. Get the nail. Get the nail. Get the nail? How much health do I have?
[927.29s -> 936.34s]  Wait, that's not the nail. That's a different nail. Yes. Get nail. Who cares? Get nail. Should
[936.34s -> 944.58s]  I get the nail? How many hearts do I have? If I pick this up, is it going to kill me?
[944.58s -> 951.26s]  You can't get the nail. Don't fall for it. Don't get the nail. Don't fall for it. What about this
[951.26s -> 963.03s]  thing? Get this for more hearts. Get them both. Do it. Please. Nail. You're a coward. Mask. Definitely.
[963.03s -> 976.97s]  You cannot get the nail. No, you can get the nail. I'm getting this. I don't want the nail.
[976.97s -> 989.61s]  I don't know. It's ruined. No, the nail... No, the nail fucked up the last run. You can't get the
[989.61s -> 1003.05s]  nail now. No, the nail fucked up the last run. I don't want it. On principle. I fucked up... No,
[1003.05s -> 1013.77s]  I didn't fuck up the last run. Didn't everyone say that I was going to get three hearts for this?
[1013.77s -> 1017.21s]  I thought, guys, you guys said if I got gimpy that it was going to give me three hearts.
[1018.94s -> 1026.49s]  It gave me one. Oh, man. Who said that? I don't know. Somebody did. I swear to God. I read it.
[1026.57s -> 1034.97s]  Like, five times. Don't worry. It's not going to get hit. Fucking hard counter. Come on. Come on,
[1034.97s -> 1062.42s]  Ed. It's not going up there again. These things are rocks. The run... No, the run's not over yet.
[1063.54s -> 1073.59s]  Not over yet. Should have got the nail. I could have... Oh, my God. Whatever. Whatever's a warmup
[1073.59s -> 1085.82s]  anyways. Who gives a shit? Throw the fucking dice. All right. I'm okay with this. I'm okay with this.
[1085.82s -> 1094.30s]  This is Judas. Let's go. He's already malding. No, I'm not. You can't... There's no malding in
[1094.30s -> 1102.42s]  Isaac unless you die at like 48 minutes of a run at a boss. No, this is nature of the game.
[1102.42s -> 1114.71s]  Nature of the game. What is that? Rock blast. Okay. I've seen this before. Five bombs. Just a
[1114.71s -> 1123.35s]  reminder that you didn't beat Odama. No, I didn't. And I'm... Go ahead. You can tack that on my
[1123.35s -> 1135.80s]  permanent record. I don't... That's fine. I'll look at my streamer report card at the end of the year
[1135.80s -> 1144.12s]  or at the end of the semester. And yeah, okay. I'll get like fucking like a C minus in...
[1144.12s -> 1149.80s]  Didn't finish a fucking game. You didn't finish as many games as you were supposed to in 2020,
[1149.80s -> 1154.60s]  semester one. Because of what? You got an F on Odama. It just brought me down. I got like a
[1154.60s -> 1162.22s]  fucking C minus on... What was that one I just beat? Katana Zero. What was the last game that I
[1162.22s -> 1171.69s]  beat? What was the last game that I completed? What was it? Super Mario Sunshine. Okay, yeah,
[1171.69s -> 1186.78s]  that's fine. I'll take that. None. You're just talking over somebody else's gameplay.
[1187.50s -> 1210.47s]  No, I beat a game before that. That hurts me? What? Oh no. What the fuck? My own... That trickle
[1210.47s -> 1216.17s]  comes over and hurts me. That's such a good item to get though. I have seven damage. I can't fuck
[1216.17s -> 1229.32s]  this up. Oh, I didn't even know. That's so bad. Well, let's go. The run's not over. I got full health
[1229.32s -> 1240.70s]  again. He's never played Bomberman. You know, I've played Bomberman, but played Bomberman 64. That
[1240.70s -> 1263.66s]  was it. Stay away from me. Stay away from this fucking guy. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Fine. Not
[1263.66s -> 1274.84s]  even a single fucking hit. Oops. What's... What's that? Plus one to lowest stat. Oh, that's pretty
[1274.84s -> 1283.35s]  cool. At least I can move around fast. I need health. All right, let's go. Oh, beautiful. I need...
[1283.35s -> 1308.57s]  Oh my god, where do I stand? Right here. Fuck you, game. He never apologized. Sorry. I'll give you a
[1308.57s -> 1315.56s]  quick little tip on... I'll give you a quick little tip on playing games like this. Focus less on
[1315.56s -> 1319.56s]  where you're shooting and more just on your immediate surroundings so you don't get hit by
[1319.56s -> 1327.72s]  anything. Except for when things blend into the ground. This is a... Oh, I can't walk over here.
[1329.78s -> 1333.86s]  Okay, that was like... I don't even know what the fuck those things even did. Like, give me a break.
[1336.44s -> 1351.16s]  They just, like, appear next to you. That's a great tip. Yeah. And even... I was paying attention to
[1351.16s -> 1363.99s]  my immediate surroundings. Snakes were appearing next to me. Nope. No. App's a fucking loot,
[1363.99s -> 1381.02s]  Luna. It's the worst item in the whole game. Jesus. Old R. Right, right, right, right, right.
[1381.02s -> 1404.92s]  No rewinds. Well, you're probably wondering why is he doing this? Because I know I'll fucking walk
[1404.92s -> 1439.30s]  into it accidentally. You fucking die. Oh my god. How is he not getting hit? Pog. This is, like, not
[1439.30s -> 1451.58s]  even... God damn it. Stop making me laugh. Oh, you're fucking making me laugh. That room's, like, not
[1451.58s -> 1457.42s]  even hard. It was, like... I mean, it was annoying, but, like, I could have been fine. Oh, dude, how
[1457.42s -> 1471.40s]  is he not getting hit? Pog. Oh. Good thing this is a warm-up round. This too-tinted rock. Oh, this is
[1471.40s -> 1477.56s]  fucking bad. Game over. Oh, that was fun. Okay, let's do it again. Maybe we'll get a good run.
[1477.56s -> 1495.42s]  All right, just blow yourself up. It's just the fifth... It's the nature of the game.
[1499.86s -> 1506.60s]  Fight it. Fight it. It's the nature of the game. Mr. Mega blast damage. Okay, that's not bad.
[1509.64s -> 1519.37s]  Oh, dude. It's like the enemies are going like this. And it's like, oh my god, holy shit. He's so good.
[1519.37s -> 1533.37s]  Pog. That's so funny. That's gonna make me laugh for the rest of the day. So, thank you for that.
[1533.93s -> 1543.96s]  Whoever the fuck you were. I didn't see the name. Take that pill. Hold on. I've got these, like,
[1544.68s -> 1553.32s]  weird enemies. I gotta fight these flies. Okay, let me give you some insight.
[1554.92s -> 1560.04s]  If you play games and talk at the same time, you'll know. You know what I'm talking about?
[1560.04s -> 1567.21s]  Where words don't... You can't say them while you're concentrating. Your brain has to focus
[1567.21s -> 1572.01s]  on the concentration aspect. And you've been on the phone... I'll give you some... You've been on
[1572.01s -> 1578.34s]  the phone talking to somebody while you're playing a game. And they're trying to talk to you, and
[1578.34s -> 1584.82s]  you just let them talk. You let them just fucking rifle off a hundred sentences. And you're just
[1584.82s -> 1592.81s]  like, yep. Yep. Uh-huh. It's like, what do you think about that? And you have no fucking idea
[1592.81s -> 1598.57s]  what the hell they were even saying. Not a clue. And you're trying to reach so desperately to
[1598.57s -> 1603.59s]  find out what you could even say to make it sound like you were even remotely paying attention.
[1603.59s -> 1612.65s]  Yeah, that's pretty... That's pretty good news. I feel like... I just got in a fucking car accident.
[1612.65s -> 1617.48s]  What are you talking about? No, no. I'm saying, like, it wasn't your fault. So, like,
[1617.48s -> 1624.44s]  your insurance probably won't go up. So that's like the cerebral aligning, I guess.
[1624.44s -> 1636.57s]  Best friend. What is this? Best friend. I'm going to the ice. Cheat sheet.
[1637.61s -> 1646.79s]  Okay. Best friend. I've never seen this item. I just clicked on a fucking ad. God damn it.
[1653.16s -> 1657.08s]  Best friend. Places a decoy on the floor which attracts enemies and explodes after a period
[1657.08s -> 1663.21s]  of time. When it explodes, there's a hundred... Okay. The fuck did I just do? No. Turn that off.
[1666.38s -> 1676.46s]  Okay. That sucks. I mean, it might be kind of good, but get an item description mod. No,
[1676.46s -> 1681.59s]  it's more fun to look it up because I like to be challenged to use a separate device
[1682.23s -> 1690.10s]  to go to a different website to click on a fucking ad. So, no, I like to... I like to challenge.
[1690.10s -> 1705.27s]  Hold on. I'm too lazy to do what you're saying to, like, quit the game and go to Steam Workshop
[1705.27s -> 1721.06s]  and do that for, like, the next few minutes. Just tell Siri to look it up for me. Does Siri... Does
[1721.06s -> 1729.32s]  that work? All right. Do we miss any intended rocks? No, no, no, no. There's no way that works.
[1732.57s -> 1739.45s]  Like, hey, Siri, what does the item... I kind of don't want to do that though because it's like,
[1739.45s -> 1752.66s]  hey, Siri, what does Mom's tampon do? Well, Jeremy, um, you see... All right, there's nothing
[1752.66s -> 1773.82s]  here. Blighted. All right, no more mistakes, man. Oh, he almost touched me. Thank you,
[1774.78s -> 1796.89s]  Super Milk. This is the run now. This is the one. It's me. Oh, Super Milk. It's the super frog
[1796.89s -> 1805.38s]  voice for those of you that are not paying attention. Curse of the Giant? What does that do?
[1806.60s -> 1820.74s]  What's Curse of the Giant? Bike's on the ground. Oh, fuck. Dude, what the fuck?
[1821.70s -> 1828.42s]  That was fucking ridiculous. What? That's, like, not even doable. That's not even... You can't even
[1828.42s -> 1835.43s]  beat that one. Holy shit. That one... You can't even beat that one. It's the nature of the game.
[1835.43s -> 1842.09s]  You know what I mean? It's the nature of the game. Just restart. That was good. I promise I will get
[1842.09s -> 1851.85s]  to the third floor tonight. That was insane. People just running around with a bucket. They
[1851.85s -> 1858.09s]  were going so fast. What does Curse of the Giant even do? Curse of the Get Fucked is what somebody
[1858.09s -> 1869.77s]  said. They sell big rooms, okay. That makes sense. That's insane. They were all champions.
[1870.65s -> 1881.40s]  Give me some good... Something good. Oh, don't... I'm so bad at these. I hate these fires. They
[1881.40s -> 1895.03s]  really get me every time. Mine. Okay, good. Does the sour please? Yeah, that's a pretty good song.
[1895.59s -> 1913.88s]  That's pretty good. I like it. I like the... I like this mods. Hold on. Sorry. Don't... Don't tell me
[1913.88s -> 1918.04s]  about anybody. Don't, like, tell me any, like, bad news right now. All right. Now I can focus.
[1918.04s -> 1925.77s]  Toxic blood. Bad. Okay. So, what was I saying? I don't even remember. I have no idea what I was
[1925.77s -> 1931.53s]  saying. I don't even remember. See, I'm on the phone with myself and I don't even remember what
[1931.53s -> 1938.55s]  I just said to me. I have like the... I have a phone upside down next to an ear and right side
[1938.55s -> 1960.89s]  up on the other one. I don't even know what I just said to myself. Yes, the gamer brain. Oh,
[1960.89s -> 1969.83s]  right. The music. Okay. So, I like... I like this mod's title screen music more than any of the
[1969.83s -> 1975.75s]  other. That's going to explode. More than any of the other Isaac expansions or musics or original
[1975.75s -> 1987.03s]  game or... I like this one the most. This is kind of a shitty start as well. I like the title
[1987.03s -> 1998.25s]  screen of this. That's objectively wrong. What the fuck? Oh, no. Not this one. The, like, hardest
[1998.25s -> 2005.86s]  first boss. Don't make excuses. I want to see somebody say, holy shit, how's he not getting hit?
[2016.84s -> 2021.72s]  Body blocked him. I did that on purpose. I know I have a heart over there. See? I did that on
[2021.72s -> 2025.32s]  fucking purpose. Damage and HP up. That's good. All right. We got hearts over here. We got a heart
[2025.32s -> 2027.64s]  over here. I did that on purpose. I body blocked him so he wouldn't be able to get me twice.
[2028.50s -> 2041.62s]  If I didn't stand in that spot and get hit by that, he would have hit me twice. Speak words?
[2041.62s -> 2046.46s]  What are you talking about? I said body block. What do you think I said? Like, body wash?
[2046.46s -> 2060.15s]  What are you talking about? I'm very bad at this game and make excuses for every time I get hit by
[2060.15s -> 2091.30s]  an enemy. Oh, by the way, in case you didn't know, I wasn't even looking. I didn't understand,
[2091.30s -> 2106.62s]  but plus two anyways. Good effort. All right. I hate these little things. I need a key.
[2107.34s -> 2124.06s]  I need bombs too. I hate them. When it turns to the meat chunks, it's the worst
[2125.78s -> 2135.78s]  because they come back. This guy had a coin, right? Or a battery. Oh yeah. Don't pick that up unless
[2135.78s -> 2153.34s]  I need it. All right. This guy's going to shoot out. Yeah. I know what you do now. I know what
[2153.34s -> 2167.53s]  you fucking do now. Not going to trick me a third time. Rock. I'll get the rock. Don't let him come
[2167.53s -> 2177.90s]  over here. They all go in a straight line. If I would get hit. I got to get that. Okay. So
[2178.86s -> 2183.50s]  you guys, when I get to the point where I need to do a puzzle for the second knife piece,
[2183.50s -> 2192.20s]  you got to like, I need to see spam. I need to see like attention, attention, attention. You need
[2192.20s -> 2200.28s]  to say the word attention when there's a knife piece that I can get. You have to get my attention.
[2200.84s -> 2215.29s]  I'm not doing that. I don't have any keys. You missed a rock. I only have one bomb though and
[2215.29s -> 2237.54s]  I need two. Hold on. Come on. Give me a key down here. Well, I, no keys. Yeah. I mean, I could go
[2237.54s -> 2244.92s]  here. Should I, should I blow up the heart guy over there or was it secret room left or right?
[2244.92s -> 2250.68s]  What do you think? I need two bombs. Tinted rock. I could get a key out of the tinted rock, right?
[2255.99s -> 2265.66s]  Attention, attention. Donation guy. Yeah. The rock could give, well, let's see what happens.
[2265.66s -> 2273.30s]  Let's take our chance. Well, it, yeah. Well, now what? Now I can't get the item in the second room.
[2273.86s -> 2288.28s]  Attention all Fortnite gamers. Ah, go to the sacrifice room. No, I'm going to lose all my
[2288.28s -> 2298.65s]  hearts. Let me just kill this guy and see what happens. This is a bad room to fight this guy in.
[2299.37s -> 2324.60s]  Hey, all right. Where are you? Wait, what the fuck? Holy shit. I didn't even know that was a
[2325.32s -> 2330.76s]  right. You want to push here. You want to push one into your lowest stat. Here you go. Hey,
[2330.76s -> 2341.13s]  you're a lucky guy now. Oh shit. Wait a minute. That's not, how was that number? Why is that my
[2341.13s -> 2345.61s]  lowest stat? Isn't luck my lowest stat? All right. Now I'm going to sacrifice a bunch of hearts to
[2345.61s -> 2361.40s]  this guy. Give me some shit. Give me something. Beggar, the beggar. Yeah. This guy. No, I don't
[2361.40s -> 2400.12s]  want the coin beggar. I want this guy. This guy's going to help me out. You can use him twice for
[2400.12s -> 2416.38s]  one. Well, I don't know. I don't know the exploit secret room, but I need a bomb. Do I take my
[2416.38s -> 2429.80s]  chances? Do I take my chances and give him like the rest of these hearts? The coin beggar. Where's
[2429.80s -> 2435.74s]  this coin beggar you're talking about? Is he on the other side? Is he up here? Oh, he's, oh fuck
[2435.74s -> 2440.30s]  yeah, he is. No, this is going to be all my money. All right. I'm going to get here. Take it all.
[2451.40s -> 2470.23s]  Ray. Take care. Come on. No, not another fucking card. Do it again. Again. Fuck, is this a lighter?
[2470.79s -> 2488.22s]  You have to reset now. Just reset now. No, I can't just reset. No, it's the nature of the game, but
[2488.86s -> 2499.40s]  just anymore coins lying around. Somebody look under that couch. Any more coins? No, no, I'm not
[2499.40s -> 2506.42s]  holding down R. I'm not doing it. I got the world. I'm going. I'm not holding down. I'm not resetting.
[2506.42s -> 2523.03s]  Hold R buddy. No, look, there's things I can't do. Whatever. Just I need to do like a fucking run.
[2523.75s -> 2555.93s]  I keep getting in trouble. Okay. Well, easy, easy, easy. I need a key. It's salvageable.
[2555.93s -> 2566.46s]  This is salvageable as long as key. Take a room. I need two bombs though. Whatever. You gotta make,
[2566.46s -> 2576.23s]  you gotta take chance. Okay. So I blow up the, I need two bombs for that. That's not worth it.
[2576.87s -> 2589.14s]  If I get a key, I'll be okay. It's salvageable. Where's this guy? What's left? What's left?
[2589.86s -> 2600.73s]  I got three bombs now. Go to the left room. Secret room. Key is inside of you.
[2617.75s -> 2624.46s]  Blow this up, right? Blow this up. And then I go down and let's hope it's a cool item. No,
[2624.46s -> 2638.33s]  it just skips the level. It's not a ladder. Sleep in the bed. Minus one bomb. No, no, don't tell me
[2638.33s -> 2649.50s]  to hold down R. Look, I can, I can, I open the door from here. The door's unlocked now, right?
[2649.50s -> 2660.63s]  Yeah. I can walk out and unlock it. Hey, well, look at this. I can skip. Just give me a key
[2660.63s -> 2670.15s]  and this can be salvageable. What does the fighter do? Oh, fuck these enemies. Oh, fuck you.
[2670.95s -> 2679.72s]  Got it. Bomb the beggar. I, I don't want to do that yet. I need two bombs. Remember?
[2680.36s -> 2694.78s]  I need two bombs to get the heck out of here. Okay. Set. Run saved, I think. Run saved.
[2698.25s -> 2702.62s]  Yeah. Can we, should we, should we get a translation? Yeah. You know the drill.
[2703.26s -> 2726.17s]  I don't know what either of these two things do. It hurts. No, it doesn't. Okay. I guess it
[2726.17s -> 2737.08s]  doesn't hurt. Bomb into the shop. No, I need two bombs. If I bomb into the shop, I'm going to lose
[2737.08s -> 2756.42s]  a bomb. You're playing on keyboard. I'm playing on controller. What do you mean? Eww. This is,
[2756.42s -> 2763.64s]  it's a top, it's like a top down shooter game. I'm going to play on. We won't play keyboard? No,
[2763.64s -> 2769.16s]  my fingers will hurt. That'll hurt my fingers. I've tried it before. All right. What's this shit?
[2771.16s -> 2775.96s]  Not, oh, it's a knife piece. Got it. Okay. This is now, I can't, I can't even use this because I
[2775.96s -> 2788.47s]  can't, I don't have any bombs. I know I got the knife. You don't have to do attention. I don't
[2788.47s -> 2796.04s]  have any bombs. So this is over. Well, that's fun. If I blow it, maybe if I blow up the beggar,
[2796.04s -> 2811.14s]  they'll drop a double bomb. Go into the shop. All right. I have three coins.
[2811.94s -> 2823.03s]  Boss could give bombs. All right. We'll try that. If I skip the level, is that going to,
[2823.59s -> 2827.83s]  all right. I need some Isaac veterans here to tell me if I skip the level, will it bring me
[2827.83s -> 2834.02s]  to the anti-birth level or just go to the normal level? I don't, this is the first time I've ever
[2834.02s -> 2853.83s]  seen this boss rainmaker. Not that bad so far. Oh, that is that. Okay. Tears and shots beat up.
[2853.83s -> 2861.43s]  That's too bad because look at how good this is now. It goes to the normal level, but you have
[2861.43s -> 2869.56s]  the opportunity again on the next one. Really? Fuck. That's just more damage, but I don't think
[2869.56s -> 2896.73s]  I have enough hearts for that. I have two. This is just a waste of time. Okay. So we're going to
[2896.73s -> 2920.87s]  bomb the beggar and see if he drops two bombs. Oh, wait, wait, wait. I, could I, could I go into
[2920.87s -> 2944.97s]  the store? Okay. Go into the store and buy two bombs, buy key and open door. Oh my God.
[2945.85s -> 2956.60s]  God, how many keys do I need to open this? Holy shit. I think this, we, okay, we just did a math
[2956.60s -> 2968.89s]  problem. We just did long division. What is this? Son to a clubs motherfucker to a club as bombs,
[2968.89s -> 2991.06s]  right? Yeah. What does this thing do? Born to rock Tara. What does this do? Born to, born to rock.
[2991.06s -> 3004.98s]  This is that. Holy shit. I can't believe it. Wait a minute. Oh man. Okay. Now I got to play like a
[3004.98s -> 3013.72s]  champion. No fucking screw ups. I'm going to, I'm going to play like an absolute champion now.
[3015.30s -> 3019.70s]  Make sure I need to be, you need to have my attention by the soul heart in the shop.
[3019.70s -> 3032.31s]  I don't think there is one in there. There is. Okay. Here we go. Let's go bomb the door.
[3032.87s -> 3053.94s]  Keep moving. Make sure you get my attention. Oh, he doesn't work. Doesn't work. Make sure I need
[3053.94s -> 3076.97s]  that second piece. Every tinted rock is a free item now. That's a huge deal. Don't blow this.
[3076.97s -> 3081.13s]  I'm going to blow this, right? I'm going to like, I'm going to like do like the Kylo Ren voice for
[3081.13s -> 3086.73s]  no reason in like 40 minutes and die to the boss or something. Someone's going to be like,
[3086.73s -> 3090.49s]  Hey man, I'm driving through McDonald's. I can do the Kylo Ren and McDonald's. And I'll be like,
[3093.72s -> 3106.52s]  getting hit by a fucking truck in the game. It's going to happen. No, it's not. I'm ready.
[3106.52s -> 3110.50s]  I need two spirit hearts at the end of this. This is XL. So this is it.
[3111.30s -> 3125.32s]  XL extra large. He's going to blow this like he blows all of his money. How do you know what I
[3125.32s -> 3153.27s]  do with my money? What do you know? Okay, we can. Okay. No, we know where it is. Okay. Yep. All
[3153.27s -> 3169.02s]  right. Right. Soul generator. Oh yeah. It's starting to look, this is starting to look up.
[3169.02s -> 3188.02s]  Keep the ball rolling. Free. Free. Now just give me damage up and another tier is up. Oh, it's not
[3188.02s -> 3214.90s]  free. Free rocks. Nice. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I can't take that off if I touch it. What does it do?
[3223.11s -> 3254.54s]  It's good. I'm not touching it. Chat is mental. What? God damn it. It's all right. I didn't know
[3254.54s -> 3275.62s]  that's what that, I didn't know that's what those things did. No tinted rocks. How have there been
[3275.62s -> 3295.62s]  no rocks tinted? This is XL. Why are you guys beeping? What's the, what's the, why the, what's
[3295.62s -> 3302.31s]  the beep? I don't understand. Stop destroying the rocks. I have to. There could be, there could be,
[3302.31s -> 3312.46s]  the rock could be in here. Got one. Oh wait. I sometimes. Hey, what's that alt saying?
[3313.43s -> 3340.98s]  Scared money. Don't make money. Oh no. No, hide. Hide. Just hide. I'm safe in here in my fucking
[3340.98s -> 3344.34s]  fort. Go the other way. Dig the other way. Dig the other way. Dig the other way. Dig the, dig the
[3344.34s -> 3359.35s]  other way. Is that it? Is it, is it over? I don't know. I can't tell. Oh shit. It's just like
[3359.35s -> 3367.16s]  Minecraft. Should I dig up? No, don't dig up ever. I'm going to dig into a bomb. I know it. Is it
[3367.16s -> 3376.54s]  going to be like going into the lava? Is it open? The door's open. It's over. Okay. Hold on. Let's
[3376.54s -> 3394.81s]  just break every rock. What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what's going on? Was it not
[3394.81s -> 3405.45s]  supposed to do that? Oh, don't do the attention thing. That's only for when I have to do the
[3405.45s -> 3420.33s]  secrets and do the final boss. Oh, okay. Let's go. I'm not fucking around anymore. Don't break.
[3421.85s -> 3452.30s]  Yeah, but how do we know if there's any secrets? Don't put that down. What do I do? Okay. It's,
[3452.30s -> 3457.58s]  it's the, where the pebbles are. The order with the pebbles. So top. Okay. It's the pebble order.
[3458.22s -> 3480.52s]  So this one first. Top right, bottom right, top left, bottom left. Got it. Knife piece number two.
[3480.52s -> 3489.61s]  And a tinted rock. Fuck you. Oh, there's a, there's a monster in there. Okay. Good. I've got it. Good.
[3489.61s -> 3498.74s]  Good. Okay. I got both pieces. The last piece is with the fire. It's got to get there.
[3499.46s -> 3514.01s]  I need a key. Okay. Let's go. You've got jumpscared by a rock through the mushroom. Oh man. I should
[3514.01s -> 3542.73s]  have listened to you an hour ago. It's probably a tinted rock in here somewhere. No. Yup. There's
[3542.73s -> 3568.74s]  the key. Hey, what's that old saying? Hey, what's that old saying? It's in a BB unit.
[3569.22s -> 3577.93s]  No. Go back and get, get Tammy's head. I don't want Tammy's head. I want the book of Belial.
[3579.82s -> 3587.11s]  Hey, what's the old saying? You know, it's in a BB unit. Yeah, that's the one. Tammy's head is good.
[3587.11s -> 3610.81s]  I know, but is it as good as being able to have like maximum damage? Just use Tammy's head.
[3610.81s -> 3618.38s]  You know what? Yeah. I'm going to use Tammy's head temporarily because I can use it every room.
[3620.73s -> 3646.98s]  What's with the beep? Stop beeping. Why are you guys beeping? I'm beeping. I'm beeping.
[3648.44s -> 3656.57s]  There's the key for the, uh, oh, it's the song. Okay. Any, any tinted rocks? Do you see any?
[3657.13s -> 3702.17s]  Attention. Use the head. Go to use the head. Where are I? Hey yo, tinted rocks. I don't see any.
[3702.17s -> 3709.98s]  All right. We need, there's another, um, we're going to go to the shop. It's time for the shop.
[3709.98s -> 3726.10s]  I also need, all right. Important. I think I'm going to buy the spirit heart. I'm also going
[3726.10s -> 3748.68s]  to buy the map. Full visible map. Nice. Is it tinted rock? Okay. I need the other, uh,
[3751.22s -> 3763.00s]  I need the other room. Jesus Christ. Okay. They do that. All right. It's just a pattern.
[3763.00s -> 3774.92s]  What's the dice guy do? One of these, I think it's just money. And the other one is,
[3775.64s -> 3786.41s]  I don't know which one of the, isn't that, isn't that like just a bunch of money?
[3787.78s -> 3797.91s]  Right, right, right, right, right, right. All stats up is right. Are you serious? Oh my God. I'm
[3797.91s -> 3806.31s]  guaranteed victory, guaranteed to win. And I'm going to beat that fucking bot. Don't forget about
[3806.31s -> 3817.72s]  this. Okay. Now I can go down. Let's. Oh yeah. Fucking idiot. This is a bug. This is looking
[3817.72s -> 3833.45s]  real good. I just can't fuck up the fire thing. Hushroom. Fire. This is good damage so far. Good,
[3834.17s -> 3843.29s]  good tears up. Don't touch that thing. Don't even go. Don't Jeremy. Don't think about it.
[3844.23s -> 3868.18s]  We're good. Let's go. Almost just fooled me. Here we go. Wait, attention, attention. I need the,
[3868.18s -> 3875.62s]  the book, the book of Belial. That's correct. Yes. That'll go get it. Attention. Attention.
[3875.62s -> 3883.94s]  Gamer. Where is it up here? What did I leave it? Two bosses in a row. Yep. And then we'll deposit
[3883.94s -> 3890.62s]  two hearts and we get to get to the end game. Where is this fucking thing? Oh, it's down here.
[3890.62s -> 3907.14s]  Yeah. I'm not, I'm not going to use the book until the second boss. That's the smart play.
[3908.20s -> 3917.16s]  That's the play that gets you into the big leagues. Challenge room. I don't think so. I don't, I don't
[3917.16s -> 3922.15s]  think so. I don't think I'm going to do that. I don't think I'm going to do that. That's no,
[3922.15s -> 3927.56s]  that's a teeth room. No, I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it. I'm not doing it. No,
[3927.56s -> 3930.84s]  it might be good. I don't know. I don't want to do it. I'm a coward. I'm a coward.
[3931.48s -> 3986.65s]  This guy, this is a bad place. Fight him. Clear it. Clear it. Clear it. Clear it. Bad item. Very bad
[3986.65s -> 4010.60s]  item. Just beat him through. Look at how good this is at this boss. This is, this was built,
[4010.60s -> 4021.93s]  was made to kill this boss. What's that? Don't usually have to blow that thing up. That was a
[4021.93s -> 4041.85s]  hard counter. Was it soap? Don't pick that up. Tears and shots beat up. Oh my god. Let's go.
[4041.85s -> 4061.74s]  Let's go. Any tinder rocks? I don't see any. No, right? Yeah. Okay. Cool. Deposit. What the hell
[4061.74s -> 4077.86s]  is this again? Just take it. Don't question it. Okay. Just don't question the run. Yeah. All
[4077.86s -> 4082.82s]  right. I'm ready to go. Don't let me fuck this up. The regions after every room. Well, that's
[4082.82s -> 4091.66s]  incredible. Don't let me mess this up. When we go down here, when you, if you, I, I, I'm going to
[4091.66s -> 4097.34s]  have chat attached to the bottom of my fucking eyelids. So when I blink, I see what you're
[4097.34s -> 4126.47s]  writing. So good. Just don't ever shoot a fire. Yep. And no, and no, no Kylo Ren impressions
[4126.47s -> 4156.38s]  for the rest of the day. Oh, my kid. Should I get this? It's better than the lighter.
[4156.38s -> 4218.34s]  No, it makes chests red. Yeah. Where's that thing? Press forward. Press forward. Rally. Rally. Oh my
[4218.34s -> 4230.30s]  goodness. This is that's two. That's double shot. That's double shot. No. Oh, it's not.
[4230.30s -> 4242.70s]  That's X ray vision. Oh, it's still good though. It's better than the floating eyeball. Oh, I
[4242.70s -> 4252.25s]  thought that was double shot. I was going to say this is over if it was strength. The world. Oh,
[4252.25s -> 4257.80s]  um, does that really matter? I guess I'm just, I can know where everything is.
[4258.36s -> 4265.56s]  There it is. Okay. All right. We're going to carry around strength for the boss.
[4265.56s -> 4273.30s]  We're going to go down here into the item room and yes, um, I'll take another spirit heart,
[4273.30s -> 4300.04s]  please. Okay. Here we go. What do I do? This is not, this is not it. Attention. Attention.
[4300.04s -> 4345.70s]  Leave. Okay. Well, I'm just gonna clear shit. Attention. I need a key. Okay. 10. I can go
[4345.70s -> 4368.74s]  over here though. There's no fires in here. It's free stuff. Oh my God. Jackpot. Oh my God.
[4368.74s -> 4376.63s]  Is that item? Is this an item? Oh, okay. No, I thought it was, I thought there's a pedestal.
[4376.63s -> 4413.46s]  I was like, Oh wow. Cool. Death. Death. That just scared the shit out of me. Yeah. Dead.
[4413.98s -> 4446.14s]  All right. Plus one dead. Dead. Dead. Ooh. Shot speed and full health. I take every pill without
[4446.14s -> 4451.29s]  even looking at the, whatever the thing is on the label. Here we go. I'm going to go up.
[4451.29s -> 4467.74s]  I've got to find this secret room. I have a lot of bombs and then we get the third piece. I get the
[4467.74s -> 4490.30s]  the knife go up. Okay. Uh, attention. Remember there are signs over the map that correspond to
[4490.30s -> 4506.25s]  signs on what? On the puzzle? The presses. Attention gamer. Attention. Why did that just
[4506.25s -> 4527.54s]  happen? No, I don't want it. I'm good. I do need a key or something, right? Wait a minute.
[4529.82s -> 4537.94s]  I've got to get over there. Do the challenge. You're a coward. You have max health. Yeah, but
[4537.94s -> 4542.10s]  this is not a point for me to get cocky and do dumb things that I know I'm not capable of.
[4542.10s -> 4570.33s]  I'm capable of it. Let's do it. Fuck yeah. Let's go. Ooh, there's a third. No, this is wicked.
[4570.33s -> 4592.84s]  Fucking easy. I don't even need that heart. Not a key though. So am I in trouble here because I
[4592.84s -> 4607.14s]  can't get over this? Buy a key from the shop. I need to buy a key. Bomb the spikes. Knife pieces
[4607.14s -> 4630.50s]  next floor. Break the spikes. Oh, I can just shoot the rocks. Shoot the rocks. Step on them at random.
[4631.22s -> 4638.50s]  I need a key though. I'm so paranoid because I don't know what to do. Touch the button. I'm
[4638.50s -> 4653.02s]  going to buy a key. This is not a puzzle. This is nothing to do with a piece. Okay. Well,
[4653.02s -> 4684.66s]  fucking who cares? I'll go buy a key. I don't have any. Well, I'm going to blow this up.
[4684.66s -> 4699.37s]  Stop it. What? I want at least 15 bucks, man. I'm not throwing this run down the toilet. All
[4699.37s -> 4725.58s]  right. Let's go do this. Okay. So we're looking for, let's open this. Alrighty. Let's go. Well,
[4725.58s -> 4757.43s]  I got plenty of health everywhere. It surrounds me. This motherfucker just spams at you, huh?
[4757.43s -> 4798.34s]  Thank God. I just, I can just take hits. Who cares, man? Hit me. Hit me, Mr. Rock. We'll get
[4798.34s -> 4829.77s]  it on the way back. Whoa. This brain popped out of his skull. Wasn't there a, uh, wasn't there a game,
[4829.77s -> 4834.49s]  an old board game where you pulled boogers out of a person's nose until their brain popped out of
[4834.49s -> 4843.69s]  their head? What the fuck is wrong with that? Why? What was the point of that? Yeah. There's a,
[4843.69s -> 4848.33s]  there's a board game where you pull boogers. Gooey Louie. You pull boogers out of a guy's nose
[4849.67s -> 4860.15s]  until his brain fucking rockets out of his skull and you kill him. I'll play it on stream. Yeah.
[4869.19s -> 4875.00s]  No, you know what? Fuck it. Okay. I'll get all the old fucking shitty board games. Play them all.
[4875.64s -> 4889.67s]  I'm talking about like slobber and Sam. Posted here. Pound it. What's this? Oh,
[4889.67s -> 4901.43s]  it walked into a fucking fire. Two of spades. I'll take some fucking free shit. What's the game
[4901.43s -> 4906.94s]  with the ice where you like, and, uh, you don't want to break the ice. I think it's just called
[4906.94s -> 4925.64s]  don't break the ice. I think this was called. Play it on stream. I'll do them. I'll do them all.
[4925.64s -> 4943.58s]  Don't wake daddy. It's going to be a complete fuck face stream. All right. What's this, uh,
[4943.58s -> 4969.40s]  rock you guys talking about? It's rock. Elephant, the elephant. Down. I can't even hold them all.
[4970.04s -> 4983.26s]  What was that one? Mr. Bucket. I got the balls in my mouth. Mr. Bucket. Out of my mouth,
[4983.26s -> 4998.44s]  I'll go pump. I'll get that one too. How's this? Oh, good thing I don't have very many of those.
[4998.44s -> 5020.70s]  Another one of these. I don't want that. They have mainly mouse trap, mouse trap. Okay. I will,
[5020.70s -> 5025.88s]  I will play mouse trap, but it's going to be a scenario where I don't even play the game.
[5025.88s -> 5030.28s]  I just set the trap up. This is what everybody did. I used to have that game when I was younger,
[5030.28s -> 5034.12s]  when I was a kid, but I never, I don't even know how that game works. I've never played it.
[5034.76s -> 5038.52s]  I just set the traps up and then just play with them and like put the mouse in it and stuff and
[5038.52s -> 5041.16s]  have the, like the Rube Goldberg machine happen. I don't even know how that game works.
[5041.96s -> 5048.52s]  I don't know. Has anybody actually even played that game once to the point where they, what is
[5048.52s -> 5064.82s]  this? Key? It feels lucky. I mean, this is kind of bad. I think keep the lighter instead. Watch the
[5064.82s -> 5077.16s]  world burn. I actually didn't, it fucking sucks. Keep the key. Keep the key. Keep the key. I gotta
[5077.16s -> 5081.91s]  look it up on my fucking binding of Isaac. What do I do? Cheat sheet. What's it called? The key.
[5082.55s -> 5099.78s]  Key. It looks like it. Rusty. Gives Isaac a higher chance to find keys and chests.
[5099.78s -> 5113.62s]  Yeah, that's way better. What does a lighter do? A lighter. No, not laughter. iPad. Lighter.
[5114.18s -> 5132.86s]  Chance for enemies to burn when entering a room. Am I going to need keys? Yeah, let's go do it.
[5132.86s -> 5142.97s]  I'd rather have that. The enemies burn. Look at my damage. What's wrong with my character?
[5142.97s -> 5160.89s]  Why's my character all fucked up? Go into the curse room. Go in the curse room. Fine. It's free.
[5162.95s -> 5177.14s]  I'll take it if it's free. Did you do the puzzle? The puzzle is in the next floor. That's what I've
[5177.14s -> 5192.25s]  been screamed at. Okay. Is this a, is there a heart? There's one in the regular room.
[5192.81s -> 5216.42s]  Puzzle is the next floor. Yeah. All right. Take me back. It's time. Let's go. I'm going to save
[5216.42s -> 5226.20s]  the, I'll use the book, but you know, whatever. Who am I fighting? Siren. This is new. Probably
[5226.20s -> 5251.11s]  give her a chance. Where am I? That's weird. And that is speed and shot speed up. What do we
[5251.11s -> 5259.72s]  got in the devil room? Don't want it. Although I guess I could just take it. It's going to be,
[5259.72s -> 5263.80s]  and it's, it's going to end up being just free because I'm going to be at infinite hearts.
[5263.80s -> 5279.83s]  I mean, it, I know it's useless. You're right. Blow up her skull. Oh no, I didn't do it.
[5280.23s -> 5293.77s]  Oh, too late. As we'll restart the whole thing. Okay. This is important. This place is huge.
[5294.41s -> 5306.55s]  I have to be careful. Temperance. Okay. This is just a blood donation machine.
[5307.67s -> 5318.26s]  Just blow it up. Lucky toe has appeared in the basement. Okay. Money. And the love is just
[5318.26s -> 5324.39s]  hearts. So we're just going to, we're going to put these down on the ground. We'll come back
[5324.39s -> 5338.23s]  if we need them for any reason. Nice keys. I can't believe I got hit. I might as well fucking never
[5338.23s -> 5369.13s]  stream again. Use the teleporter. I got fucking hit. I may as well eat a shoe on stream. Oh shit.
[5369.13s -> 5378.84s]  Hold on. Wait, wait, wait. This is, uh, this is gonna, this is, this is really fucking crazy.
[5380.22s -> 5386.14s]  The bottom one, from what I remember, makes your tears fire and they can fucking explode.
[5391.43s -> 5401.08s]  It's sad. That might be a little too risky. It hurts me too. Top one is safer. Explode and kill
[5401.08s -> 5415.77s]  you. I'm going top. Knockout. Yep. This is the... Whoa. That's cool looking. It actually flies out.
[5415.77s -> 5456.58s]  A hand flies out. What do I do? Is this it? No. Wait, what did I do that for? Oh, I can't get that.
[5456.58s -> 5479.19s]  I can't get that. That move is so cool. There's a heart there. Ow. Oh, I walked into it. I've
[5479.19s -> 5497.51s]  walked into it. I've walked into it. It's okay. Plenty of healing. Ooh, I'll take them both.
[5499.50s -> 5513.83s]  Ooh. Answers. Vision. Do it. I have the world. Oh, okay. Well, I know I'm not going this way.
[5513.83s -> 5527.45s]  Let's go over here. I want to go into the, uh, the shop. Oh my God. This is the shop. This is
[5527.45s -> 5535.59s]  just the shop, but for free, but I already went in there. None of this shit is even necessary.
[5535.59s -> 5555.67s]  Just put the money back. All right. 500. Take the pill. Shot speed down. Ban every person that said
[5555.67s -> 5583.11s]  to take that pill for at least two to three minutes, at least. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[5583.11s -> 5598.36s]  Ah, just a net loss. Great. Thank you. Okay. The stars. That's just the shop. Go donate. No,
[5598.36s -> 5637.72s]  I might need this money. What's going on? Why didn't... Hey, it's supposed to blow it out.
[5637.72s -> 5649.61s]  Is this it? Is this it? Is this it? Is this it? I see two... I see fires in a room with no enemies.
[5649.61s -> 5661.32s]  Don't... I'm not going to put out any fires. Do I have to put out any of these fires?
[5661.32s -> 5666.52s]  You know how it looks. Why are you asking? I, I don't know because I'm fucking nervous. I'm
[5666.52s -> 5687.72s]  stupid. Mom's pearl. Now I'll keep the pearl. That's more soul hearts. That's more soul hearts.
[5687.72s -> 5722.01s]  Yeah. Oh my God. Okay. Good. I'm just, I'm unfucking killable. I don't lose unless I
[5722.01s -> 5726.81s]  accidentally blow out a wrong fire, which at that point I'd be very upset with myself.
[5731.30s -> 5735.30s]  Remember how this one started where it was like guaranteed. I was not going to be able to do it.
[5736.10s -> 5754.71s]  Let's punch through all three of those guys. That was insane. I wish I had more luck.
[5758.01s -> 5767.67s]  We punched that guy's brain out. Oh, I didn't even see it. Oh, I didn't even see it. All right. I
[5767.67s -> 5794.38s]  gotta be careful here. Attention gamer. There's a rock. Attention rock. Where is there a rock?
[5794.38s -> 5816.62s]  What are you guys talking about? Where is there a rock? He's lying. He's lying. He's lying. Okay.
[5817.80s -> 5851.03s]  So where is the fire room? Where is it? The big room next to the boss. Zero. So don't touch any
[5851.03s -> 5860.47s]  fires. Don't blow out any fires no matter what. I don't care where they are. This one up here.
[5861.11s -> 5912.76s]  You motherfucker. Okay. So where is it? All the way to the right. Oh, I gotta do this shit again.
[5912.76s -> 5939.88s]  Okay. All right. This way. No, it's probably this one up here. Um, just get it. Can I just take it?
[5942.95s -> 5949.59s]  I can just take it. There's no fire puzzle. Just pick it up. There's no fire puzzle. Don't blow out
[5949.59s -> 5972.71s]  any fires. Just pick it up. I got it. All right. Let's go. I got the knife. Now, is there anything
[5972.71s -> 5979.69s]  special I have to do to get to the last, this last area or no? Just beat this boss and then I get to
[5979.69s -> 6010.92s]  go through another door. That's it. Let's go. Shit. Oh my God. It's stumping. We're good. Ah,
[6011.85s -> 6022.54s]  okay. I was supposed to do that. Do I pick up anything or just go pick up the Polaroid?
[6022.54s -> 6041.88s]  Let's go. Mom's heart. What? Wait, what? Wait a minute. Does this, is this supposed to be
[6041.88s -> 6086.12s]  happening? Oh my God. I just took like a fucking million damage. Leave? Jesus. Okay. So here's like
[6086.12s -> 6104.26s]  the, here's the real, the real tunnel to the, oh God. I can't leave. I'm going in. This is
[6105.74s -> 6112.17s]  rotten heart has appeared in the basement. You're in corpse. Okay. I got to play smart
[6112.17s -> 6137.13s]  because I need to fucking get some hearts. Nothing there. Let's get some good shit in here.
[6137.77s -> 6146.23s]  Good shit only. That's not good shit. That's not, that's not good shit either. Where am I going?
[6149.59s -> 6155.74s]  In Krampus. Of all the assholes I didn't want to see right now, I don't want to see you,
[6155.74s -> 6184.82s]  but I'll take the coal. Back to what we were doing. Okay. Good. Very good. Poop wine tears.
[6185.46s -> 6222.66s]  I'm gonna say down. Keep your distance. Keep your distance. Just don't let them come near you. Just
[6222.66s -> 6246.54s]  knock them the fuck up. Okay. We're good. Oh my God. It's another one. Oh, okay. Can I destroy
[6246.54s -> 6268.10s]  those? No. Well, it's obviously not over here. You're doing so badly. I haven't gotten hit since
[6268.10s -> 6277.93s]  I came down here. What are you talking about? I haven't taken one point of damage. Um, this is
[6277.93s -> 6291.08s]  different. Let's just, how does this thing do? It's like a broken needle. It's trinket, right? Let's
[6291.08s -> 6299.54s]  see. Let's cheat. There it is. Broken syringe gives you a random syringe effect to every room.
[6299.54s -> 6320.33s]  Well, um, it could be bad. Too random. Too random. Too random. We're not going for, I don't know
[6320.33s -> 6346.25s]  what that is. That's like a, uh, like a box tail. We need to work in certainties right now. I got
[6346.25s -> 6361.38s]  a lot of money. I don't know. I'll never know what these guys do. Okay. Who's the, who's the boss?
[6363.51s -> 6382.23s]  Keep him away. This is it. Oh man. That's going to be even more, isn't it? Holy shit. Oh my God.
[6383.03s -> 6387.46s]  Okay. I'm ready. This is un, this is impossible for me to lose, right?
[6388.10s -> 6394.30s]  I'm going in. I don't even care. I got full hearts. I got a book and I got strength. Three, two, one,
[6394.30s -> 6430.70s]  go. And I was going to hold reset on this shit. All right. Well, there's my evil up. Okay. What
[6430.70s -> 6443.08s]  do you got for me, devil? Nothing. It was Krampus. Let's go. Take the deal. What deal? This is it,
[6443.08s -> 6450.39s]  right? This is the end. Orbs two. Look at those. Look at those three huge rooms down there. What
[6450.39s -> 6480.04s]  the fuck? Holy shit was insane. You see, you know, I do, I can do the way I can do the book of
[6480.04s -> 6522.14s]  all hell twice. Yeah. God damn it. That's what I want. There it is right in the middle. You don't
[6522.14s -> 6526.06s]  even need that, but I want it. It has nothing to do with needing anything. It has to do with wanting
[6526.06s -> 6544.68s]  it. What am I going to spend it on at this point? It's just a thing I want. See, that's why we
[6544.68s -> 6564.79s]  collect these things. It's tier delay. It's this is like soy milk. Come on. Yeah. We want the
[6564.79s -> 6592.78s]  cosmetic. What just happened? Oh, poop hat or riot. What do you think I'm trying to do?
[6595.26s -> 6600.79s]  But what do you think this is? I'm very clearly trying to get the shit hat.
[6610.94s -> 6614.06s]  Use the blood bank to get yourself to one heart to have the Polaroid be active.
[6614.62s -> 6634.97s]  Did I do that? Did I do that? Did I do that? Like that? You have to be at half a heart. Oh,
[6634.97s -> 6657.14s]  well, I can't. If I do that again, I'll die. I'll pick up half a heart and then do it. Okay. Cool.
[6657.14s -> 6669.62s]  What does that matter? How often is that going to activate? It doesn't matter. So why did I just do
[6669.62s -> 6675.40s]  that? I'll get it. I'll get it. When I get hit, I'll go invincible. Every time you get hit,
[6675.40s -> 6682.90s]  you'll be invincible. God, I love this game. Don't you just love this game? Don't you just love
[6683.94s -> 6690.20s]  having a 20 of everything? Don't you love getting the poop hat? Is that I'm not leaving till I get
[6690.20s -> 6695.83s]  it? Just don't accidentally touch any of that shit. All right. I'll do it here. Here, here, here.
[6696.55s -> 6704.18s]  There you go. Hey, nothing. I picked up a fucking stupid heart.
[6705.94s -> 6725.38s]  Attention. Okay. I don't care about, I'm leaving. I'm, I don't want to do it anymore. I don't care.
[6726.26s -> 6730.54s]  Use the machine when you have a shield. No, that means I'm going to get more money
[6731.66s -> 6738.36s]  and I'll have to sit in here for like another 20 minutes. Just scam money with the shield.
[6739.00s -> 6740.92s]  I don't want any more money. I don't want any more money.
[6746.44s -> 6757.26s]  All right. Okay. Scam. Don't do it. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. I'll do it accidentally and die.
[6758.78s -> 6768.54s]  Don't do that. Where's my poop hat? Where's the hat? This kills me. Okay. I can get a troll bomb.
[6768.54s -> 6780.46s]  I'm leaving. Okay. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. No, bye. I'm not going to get it.
[6781.18s -> 6810.74s]  What was that? You only get one chance. Wait. You only get one chance. Or somebody just saying
[6810.74s -> 6829.70s]  that to like save the stream. It's a hero. Oh, I don't want any more hearts. Come on. I have 10
[6829.70s -> 6835.26s]  chances here. Hold down. I'm not going to do that because I'll walk into the fucking enemy.
[6835.90s -> 6857.83s]  You should need to hold R to activate your shield. Five chances is it. I'm not going to even get it.
[6858.47s -> 6875.37s]  It's not even going to show up again. One more chance. That's it. Yeah. Sorry. You don't get it.
[6875.37s -> 6881.66s]  You don't get a poop hat. Sorry, guys. Don't. I don't care. I have 28 keys. Do we think I
[6881.66s -> 6891.88s]  give a shit about this? Let's go. Wait. What's that? Why is that hard to have shit on it?
[6893.85s -> 6900.46s]  Wait. It's blocking the door. It's blocking the door. It's blocking the door. Okay. I'm fine.
[6900.46s -> 6903.74s]  Don't pick it up. It's blocking. Can I move it? I'm going to blow a bomb up next to it.
[6903.74s -> 6930.70s]  I'm out. I don't care. I don't care what it does. I don't want it. You owe us a poop hat.
[6938.46s -> 6951.37s]  Is that full health? This is not going to give me like health. Oh shit. No. Stop opening chests.
[6952.34s -> 6958.98s]  No more opening chests and shit. There's probably hearts in there. Give me a fucking break.
[6962.82s -> 6974.26s]  Don't touch anything. No, I'm not. I don't care about the poop hat.
[6974.26s -> 7003.38s]  Don't want to make a new username for it. I don't care. Get out of the way. Get out of the way.
[7003.86s -> 7087.11s]  Blocking my shot. I heard something. I heard a... Excuse me. Excuse me. Come here. Oh, a bunch of
[7087.11s -> 7112.86s]  drugs. Okay. Should I just take this and just forget about the shield? Because I mean, you're
[7112.86s -> 7119.72s]  talking about like three or four hits that I can't take. I'm going to carry it with me. I've got an
[7119.72s -> 7131.08s]  idea. We're going to do health up again and then I'm going to do full health if I lose these hearts.
[7131.08s -> 7135.14s]  You know what I'm saying? If I go down to one spirit heart, I'm going to do...
[7136.34s -> 7140.36s]  Am I an idiot? Is that a bad idea? All right. I'm just going to take the health up. But what
[7140.36s -> 7152.04s]  about the strength? You'll lose it. Holy shit. Okay. Fuck strength. Just heal and use strength.
[7152.04s -> 7160.04s]  Full health just makes you lose health. Just take the health. Who cares? Take strength and leave.
[7160.04s -> 7166.47s]  What do you mean take strength? I can't leave? All right. Okay. All right. All right. All right.
[7166.47s -> 7171.99s]  Take the full health, not health. Okay. All right. I'm ready. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
[7171.99s -> 7176.63s]  Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm ready.
[7176.63s -> 7190.31s]  I'm ready. Use strength now. That's not going to do anything. It's going to disappear.
[7190.31s -> 7194.23s]  Use it and take the strength. I'm going to go up my gut. I'm going to go up my gut.
[7194.23s -> 7236.81s]  Where's all this stuff? What's that radish thing? Did I get it? What does it do? Delicious. Rotten
[7236.81s -> 7267.06s]  tomato. I'm going to witness. And you were concerned. And you were concerned. Oh, is that
[7267.06s -> 7289.13s]  not it? Look at the little spider shank. What happened, dad? That was so easy. I killed it.
[7289.13s -> 7296.57s]  That was so fucking bad. I was like, what should I do? I got fucking 21 damage and two tier delay.
[7297.29s -> 7317.80s]  Pull up skull. Well, that was fun. Why is there a helicopter overhead?
[7318.95s -> 7350.30s]  More? Use every bomb. Oh, that was cool. That build was really, really, really powerful.
[7351.18s -> 7373.48s]  Kaldama has, you unlocked Jacob and Aesop. You unlock challenge eight awakening. You unlock
[7373.48s -> 7386.04s]  challenge nine, seeing double. What did I unlock? What the fuck? Jacob and Aesop. You play two
[7386.04s -> 7404.38s]  people? That seems kind of cool. I'm going to see what this looks like. What? Wait, they have their
[7404.46s -> 7409.02s]  own health bars. This is some ice climber shit. I don't know if I can handle this.
[7413.27s -> 7434.82s]  They get different items each or they use the same item. It's cool. What happens if, all right, can,
[7434.82s -> 7455.21s]  can like, can like papa get knocked off the stage? This reminds me of Lilith, but way cooler.
[7457.42s -> 7467.77s]  So if one of them dies, do they both die? This is going to be a pain in the ass. Yes. Oh God.
[7468.41s -> 7480.63s]  Uh-oh, wait. Uh-oh. Wait, you can't, how do I make them go back together again?
[7480.63s -> 7489.08s]  You squish them to the wall. Okay, there we go. They can get stuck. You got desynced.
[7490.04s -> 7497.46s]  Oh, yup. This is, this, I know I see where the trickiness of this comes in. The trickiness of
[7497.46s -> 7511.54s]  playing this, uh, Ben and Jerry, what are their names? Jacob and, and it's, what is it? Aesop?
[7512.18s -> 7526.36s]  I'll get that key. Don't worry. I'm just clearing, but they both have the effects of whatever item
[7526.36s -> 7537.30s]  you pick up. Read the Bible. Oh, sorry. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I'm not caught up with my,
[7537.30s -> 7542.58s]  with my fucking Bible lore. I, I have to, I, I, sorry. Yeah. Let me, let me, let me read
[7542.58s -> 7549.35s]  the Bible real quick to figure out who these two are. This, this isn't like infinity war.
[7549.35s -> 7553.35s]  You know what I mean? Like the idea that I haven't read the Bible in a very long time.
[7556.87s -> 7569.10s]  Who ha what's going on? Who has that? Where is it? What just happened? It was used. It's used
[7569.10s -> 7578.55s]  instantly. They use pickups automatically. What the fuck? Why? Hold on. So I can't use any pickups.
[7579.27s -> 7603.19s]  Mr. I don't have anything to blow it up with. I want an item room. They auto use pickups because
[7603.19s -> 7629.19s]  they can each have a different active item. That's bizarre. That's weird. I could see this being
[7629.19s -> 7635.78s]  really fun though. If you get some, if you get like the Ouroboros tears, whatever the ones that
[7635.78s -> 7651.37s]  spin around and like anti-gravity and shit, this could be really, really cool. Oh, that's unfortunate.
[7652.01s -> 7657.66s]  That's unfortunate. I mean, just use it. No, they use it automatically. I can't,
[7658.38s -> 7673.98s]  oh, this is not, they, that doesn't just fall on the ground. Oh, that's a reset right there.
[7673.98s -> 7686.60s]  If I've ever seen one. Recept Randy. You would reset too. You would reset too if you were in my
[7686.60s -> 7708.17s]  position. Wait, is it the monk I asked question mark? Is that what we should be doing? The book
[7708.17s -> 7719.05s]  of Genesis speaks of the relationship between, I don't know, the book of Genesis, guys, I don't,
[7719.05s -> 7725.58s]  the only book of Genesis I've ever read was when, was when like fucking GameStop used to come up
[7725.58s -> 7743.85s]  with the cheat code book for the different consoles. No, don't pick it up. Oh, oh, here comes a reaction.
[7769.02s -> 7783.56s]  It's pretty fucking good. Oh, oh, looks like we ain't going to the underworld or whatever it's
[7783.56s -> 7792.06s]  called. Don't stand over there. It was, yeah, I know I saw it. Genesis, I know you don't have
[7792.54s -> 7800.95s]  to, we don't need, this is not like the Bible study class. Who's taking it? Yeah,
[7801.59s -> 7827.40s]  we can have item rooms. Where the hell is the item room? Oh, gonna have to start dishing out some time
[7827.40s -> 7838.68s]  outs here. Gonna have to start timing people out for their misbehavior. Oh, gonna have to start
[7838.68s -> 7864.15s]  timing people out, but they're unbehaving. Wait, they both don't get it. Only one of them gets it?
[7864.15s -> 7873.00s]  This is so confusing. Oh, so you have to, you have to plan out how, who's going to be what character.
[7873.00s -> 7883.32s]  You have to like play, oh, they get separate stats each. This is so cool. Let's see if I can get that.
[7884.78s -> 7889.10s]  Just jack up one character. Yeah. All right. What if I just make one character insane
[7889.10s -> 7901.86s]  and just make sure the other one doesn't die? Where's that tinted rock? Give every health item
[7901.86s -> 7905.54s]  to one person and give every damage item to another person. And then the one, but the health
[7905.54s -> 7924.20s]  just stands in the front. Okay. This is what the, yeah, it's out of here. Fuck. One of them's almost
[7924.20s -> 7934.97s]  dead. Who's, who's the bone in the bottom right? Red guy or green guy? Okay. Red guy can't get hit
[7934.97s -> 7971.30s]  anymore. Oh shit. Smush. It's Mario and Luigi? Oh God. Yeah. It's too confusing with.
[7980.76s -> 8000.15s]  Watch out for that fire. Stop. I can't move. If I move up or if I move down, one was going to get
[8000.15s -> 8045.02s]  hit. God. That's okay. Ah, shit. It's okay. Watch out for super frog. Nothing. Just give me an item
[8045.02s -> 8064.46s]  room. Damage or something. What? I can't die. I want to bring these two into greed mode. How
[8064.46s -> 8082.49s]  come it doesn't exist? Jesus Christ. Does that mean I get more than one key? So if this one key
[8082.49s -> 8085.53s]  does that mean it's actually two keys? Can I walk in with one of them and not the other one?
[8096.58s -> 8129.32s]  Oh, I can't get that. Wait, I can't like stand on his shoulders? Easy. That's unfortunate.
[8130.04s -> 8136.38s]  What's the seed? Here's the seed if you want it. I don't need to restart yet.
[8137.34s -> 8148.90s]  I'll be happy if I can kill mom's foot with this. I'll be happy. This internet itself is almost
[8148.90s -> 8176.62s]  like a challenge mode. Hey, that was erratic. I don't tell them you need to plug in another
[8176.62s -> 8216.42s]  controller. Oh, this is also really bad too. What? What? I can hold. Oh no. That's. I was trying to
[8216.42s -> 8225.13s]  tell you that. Well, um, so I can just play the game with this one and just make sure this one
[8225.13s -> 8252.15s]  doesn't get hit. Why would I do that? All right. You stay over here. I just like swallowed air
[8252.15s -> 8279.42s]  for a second. Relax. Might as well re-roll the enemies. Whoa. That was very, very close.
[8279.42s -> 8294.58s]  Something worth taking. It's not re-roll enemies. It's not like the wing thing, whatever it is.
[8295.70s -> 8333.88s]  Oh, bad. Oh, this is bad. Oh, this is bad. Oh, I have a wicked itchy head. Okay. There we go.
[8333.88s -> 8348.02s]  Dude, these two guys, these two suck. It's not me. It's the, it's them, not me. Oh my God.
[8350.65s -> 8358.87s]  Well, refill your health. All right. If it's not a really good item, I'm going to, I'm going to do,
[8358.87s -> 8412.18s]  undo character. That doesn't break. Okay. Who's going to take it? Red guy. You take it. Uh, yeah.
[8412.18s -> 8421.99s]  All right. Red, red guy is going to, red guy is going to be the drug taker. I think. What? Red guy
[8421.99s -> 8430.47s]  is food tester. Here, red guy, eat this. See if it's poisonous. Yeah, it is. Okay. I'll make sure
[8430.47s -> 8459.40s]  not to eat that one. Good. What a shitty place for this. Oh, don't get hit by that. It's going to
[8459.40s -> 8485.18s]  shoot me again. What? Look at this. Okay. Red guy. That's mine. Damage up. Not bad so far. All right.
[8485.18s -> 8496.02s]  Can I make red guy walk into the spikes? So we can, I guess I needed that health. Damn. Red guy,
[8496.02s -> 8523.98s]  do you need health? No. Do I? No. Rock. Where is there a rock? Oh, up. I don't see it. Left and up.
[8533.00s -> 8566.54s]  Nope. Flies. Whoa. He jumped very far. Okay. What is it? Who's going to get it? Okay. It's lipstick.
[8568.31s -> 8573.99s]  Yeah. The fucking way. Red guy. It's mine. You can have the next one. Red guy.
[8573.99s -> 8606.82s]  They go through. Now they're going to do that. I want to do regular game. Destroyed on red wine.
[8607.54s -> 8626.36s]  Uh, it's pretty good. Remember, if there's a tinted rock, make sure you go. German. I see a tinted
[8626.44s -> 8657.05s]  rock. I see one. I don't feel so loud. It annoys me. All right. Red guy. Okay. Good. Very good.
[8657.05s -> 8723.35s]  Oh, he leaks. I didn't know he leaked. He leaks. God. I'm all right. I'm gonna. Oh my God. It's the
[8723.35s -> 8760.81s]  fucking die. All right. You each get one share. I see a tinted rock. Where? Those dumb enemies. Dumb.
[8760.81s -> 8789.02s]  We should take it. So what does this do? It spawns flies. That's pretty cool. Oh, that is pretty
[8789.02s -> 8823.69s]  cool. It doesn't really matter. You just take it automatically. From what? What happened? I'm
[8823.69s -> 8829.14s]  going to go from both sides. Oh, wait, wait, wait. We're going to move. Oh, I'm so stupid. I didn't
[8829.14s -> 8842.31s]  think that through. I had to move. Okay. Hold on. You need the red guy. Go get it. I didn't think
[8842.31s -> 8885.93s]  that's through at all. Okay. What is it? Oh, yay. He loves it. He loves it. Let's go frozen in fear.
[8886.49s -> 8911.78s]  Hey, oh, come on. What do you have to explode? What's the point in that? What's the point in that?
[8911.78s -> 8917.22s]  It's you just make, you're just trolling your audience. You're trolling your gaming audience.
[8917.22s -> 8976.01s]  Okay. I died. I actually died. Wait, I have an idea. Okay. Good. Now those, those items were
[8976.01s -> 8985.45s]  trashy anyways. You know, like what I got, I got mom's, uh, like tampon thing. Not even worth it.
[8985.45s -> 9001.37s]  I didn't get any good items. Red guy got hit like four times. Wait, um, did they both get a familiar
[9001.37s -> 9009.86s]  if you pick up a familiar? Oh, what was this game? Not even worth it. All right. Uh, who gets drugs?
[9011.35s -> 9031.51s]  I, you red guy, you do it. Speed is good with these two. They both get it. Nice. So they shared
[9031.51s -> 9051.98s]  the drugs. I know. I see it too. What was that? Oh, it was the stupid exploding bug. All right.
[9051.98s -> 9059.70s]  You know, who's taking it? Why did it hurt me? Wait, he said, did he took the drugs and then
[9059.70s -> 9090.74s]  slap me in the face? Well, this is going to be a pain in the ass, huh? Restart.
[9095.58s -> 9119.10s]  No, not until I, not until I fight the boss. Oh, we're dead. We're like so thick together.
[9119.10s -> 9156.18s]  Oh, okay. We're good. Dog food. Red guy. I don't have any keys. So we have to go down.
[9156.18s -> 9163.05s]  No keys. The German hates restarting. Well, not okay. If I don't get any keys, I want to
[9163.05s -> 9167.43s]  play as a different character, but the random, you have to go with the random. You got to roll with
[9167.43s -> 9176.57s]  and that's the nature of the game. I want to make these two work, but I might not be able to.
[9188.55s -> 9202.39s]  Red guys piss. Excuse me. All right. More drugs. Shot speed down. Can I run faster than the shots?
[9202.39s -> 9232.01s]  Are you serious? That's so stupid. Bomb, bomb, bomb. It's a bomb. It's not a bomb. Split up.
[9241.99s -> 9265.03s]  No. All right. It's not, it's not bad. It's not bad. We just need a key. I got a leap on you.
[9265.03s -> 9285.03s]  Grandma, I see a rock. I see a tinted rock. You do? No, you don't. You don't see them. What are
[9285.03s -> 9323.54s]  you talking about? See how thick they are? No keys either. Right there. Oh my God. Horrible room.
[9323.54s -> 9334.28s]  Who gets the jawbreaker? Why is there not a third, why is there not a third Ed brother?
[9337.70s -> 9350.68s]  I get it. I need health. Is there any hearts lying down on the ground somewhere?
[9350.68s -> 9365.62s]  There's not. This is bad. This is, might be a reset. This might be a restart. It depends
[9365.62s -> 9391.03s]  on what happens here. Holy shit. I was, did I eat it? Okay. Hog food again. Well, we may as well
[9391.03s -> 9397.51s]  just have them both be the same, but there's a devil deal. Okay. Holy shit. All right. One,
[9397.51s -> 9403.21s]  if you take the kit. All right. One, if you take the collar, why don't you take the tail?
[9403.21s -> 9417.62s]  Hold on. Will he die? He'll die. All right. So what if you take the collar and the tail and then I
[9417.62s -> 9453.00s]  make sure you stay alive. Okay. Red guy. What are you ruined? Why? Times one. Was that joke funny?
[9453.64s -> 9486.65s]  I don't know. Still can't get in the item room. That sucks. Oh, dude. Drinking game. Drink every
[9486.65s -> 9495.98s]  time Drew says, this is bad. Sit. This is bad. Oh, no, this is bad. Oh, it's bad. You're drinking
[9495.98s -> 9500.79s]  fucking water though. No, not anything else. So there's a water drinking game. You take a shot
[9500.79s -> 9515.08s]  of water. This is church. You know what I mean? Like, oh, we're taking shots of water. You don't
[9515.08s -> 9541.91s]  have to drink that alcohol. No, we don't. No, no, no, no, no. Place. Come on. Big place. Big place.
[9557.30s -> 9567.02s]  Run over. Oh, are you sure about that? Run over, huh? Run over. Run over. Red guy. Get it. Look,
[9567.02s -> 9588.52s]  I'm playing every Resident Evil game that had co-op after 2008. Oh my fucking God.
[9592.44s -> 9595.08s]  That hurt my whole body. That actually did hurt. It sucks. Fuck.
[9611.90s -> 9616.44s]  So does it matter who picks this shit up? I guess you got that one.
[9622.04s -> 9667.53s]  Isaac won. Okay. I'll allow it. I'll allow it. Pretty good. Pretty good. Nice work. Okay. So after
[9667.53s -> 9702.78s]  we completely fucked that whole thing up. Opening. I see an opening. I see an opening. This guy's
[9702.78s -> 9709.77s]  fucking insane at this game. Imagine like you just came in right now and you're like, imagine like
[9709.77s -> 9712.09s]  you like it and you like it and you like it. How many times are you going to say fucking like
[9712.09s -> 9717.13s]  and the same fucking like? Like, set and select fucking like. Imagine like you. Imagine you come
[9717.13s -> 9759.93s]  in right now. Speed up. I don't want speed up. It's kind of sucks with these two because they
[9759.93s -> 9773.45s]  run into walls. Jerma, I see it. Tinted rock. It doesn't matter who gets it. I need keys. Have
[9773.45s -> 9788.42s]  I found one key in the whole time in like three floors? Oh, there's one. Whoa. That was close.
[9789.30s -> 9816.82s]  Blow up. Blow up. Blow up. Key. Okay. Now I need. Should I open a? Hey, scared money don't make money.
[9827.77s -> 9836.76s]  Back to Bob's brain. Bob's brain percent. It's over. Okay. Like if you could hit go,
[9836.76s -> 9845.34s]  if you could make a bet right now and you had like, let's say it was 500 to one odds
[9845.34s -> 9851.86s]  that I wasn't going to die in the next one floor. Would you take those odds now that I have Bob's
[9851.86s -> 9856.65s]  brain and one heart? Like, would you take that? Would you do that? Would you be like, you know
[9856.65s -> 9860.89s]  what? I think he, you know, it's a huge fucking chance, but I think he might be able to do this.
[9861.61s -> 9883.11s]  Would you put like 10 bucks on that? What happened? Oh, wait, why? Where's Bob's brain?
[9883.11s -> 9888.42s]  Where's the? Oh, there it is. Okay. I got a little concerned there for a second.
[9888.98s -> 9904.33s]  Hold on a second. Just have red guy die every time and I, I'll never lose. Just have him get
[9904.33s -> 9924.49s]  killed every time. That's going to kill me. I might as well like just, just play as a different
[9924.49s -> 9933.82s]  character at this point. There's no way I'm going to live. These two are cool, but they really are
[9933.82s -> 9954.46s]  very difficult to play. Oh yeah. I was going to do a Bethany run. Wasn't I? I'm going to try. Oh
[9954.46s -> 9986.39s]  my God. Everything. Watch out for that fucking brain. It's okay. I'm never going to just go in
[9986.39s -> 10022.38s]  a different room. Just go in a different room. Oh great. Super wrath. I get this too, with these
[10022.38s -> 10028.78s]  two, it's too hard. I'm too concerned about Bob's brain now and I got to move them both around.
[10028.78s -> 10054.76s]  They're both super thick. It's triple the hit Bob. Did I even know the item room yet? No,
[10054.76s -> 10092.82s]  I don't have the fucking key. Jump Bob. What's still life? Okay. We can continue.
[10111.35s -> 10127.58s]  Sorry, I can never lose. I can play as many times as I want. Don't leave me. Don't leave me. Don't
[10127.58s -> 10137.00s]  leave me. Oh my God. I almost just killed him with Bob's brain. Back up, back up together.
[10137.00s -> 10166.98s]  All right, we're good. No key. This is like the kid that's rented out the arcade and gets as
[10166.98s -> 10177.19s]  many coins as he wants. Oh, versus Chad. I could see that. The thing I got Bob's big ass brain.
[10177.19s -> 10211.00s]  Dude, I could. No, just do the regular game. Do you think I have no chance? Do it. Do it. Item
[10211.00s -> 10218.84s]  room. I can't get into the item room. You're immortal. Literally immortal. Yeah, I'm immortal,
[10218.84s -> 10226.63s]  but I can die over and over again. I still have to not get hit. Secret room. Where's the secret room
[10226.63s -> 10243.88s]  up here? This is training right here, right? Well, let's just cover all of our bases. It's
[10243.88s -> 10259.00s]  like one of these slots right here. No, what the fuck? No, what the fuck? Line up with the door.
[10259.00s -> 10288.87s]  What are you guys talking about? No, you can't use brain. Yeah, but I just get to time travel.
[10288.87s -> 10295.80s]  I get to just go back in time. I get hit once and I die, but I can do it infinite amount of times.
[10296.76s -> 10324.66s]  All right. Who thinks has better luck at the casino? Red guy or other guy? Oh my God. I just
[10324.66s -> 10357.40s]  panicked through Bob's brain. We need hearts. No. I can't. Just blow it all up. Fire the brain. Fire
[10357.40s -> 10389.02s]  the brain. Fire the brain. Retreat. Retreat. Retreat. What is this one? I just unlocked it.
[10389.02s -> 10415.56s]  Isaac's. You get a sword. Wait a minute. Is it an actual melee weapon? Dude, you can. I'm going to
[10415.56s -> 10429.75s]  be real good at this. I think I found the thing that I can do very well. I'm going to kill every
[10429.75s -> 10451.75s]  boss in less than a second. How much damage does it do? Do I, does it get damage up? Why can I find
[10451.75s -> 10478.63s]  this out in the wild? God damn it. Let's go. Guga flies. Oh, that's, that's really interesting.
[10478.63s -> 10489.75s]  Really cool. Like a character you are. Um, let me introduce you to a fucking 39.2 mouse clicks a
[10489.75s -> 10510.01s]  second. What's this? Still hit. That's fine. If I take one heart, I'll spam and kill them instantly.
[10510.01s -> 10522.62s]  Yeah, I don't want to do that. I'm going to item room. I can pick the rocks up. Yeah, that's yep.
[10527.24s -> 10535.50s]  There is no item room in these challenges. Is there? No, there's no item room in challenges.
[10544.78s -> 10553.70s]  Coins. Fuck. You have the bracelet of strength. Re. Pick up coins. What the fuck?
[10555.06s -> 10560.50s]  I'm going to get them. Wait, where? Why did that just not show up on my fucking mini map?
[10561.14s -> 10610.49s]  You have the bracelet of, yeah. Okay, let's go. Slow down, MonkaS please. Does the shield block
[10610.49s -> 10626.47s]  all projectiles or is only some? This is a really cool item though. Is this added in
[10626.55s -> 10638.60s]  anti-birth or is this an item that's in the base game? It's from anti-birth. Oh,
[10638.60s -> 10665.45s]  okay. Got a big arc too. Um, let's, let's just go, um, hold on. Uh, let's go kill this boss instantly.
[10665.45s -> 10684.42s]  HP up. Not like it matters, but I could maybe try and find a key.
[10692.94s -> 10710.97s]  Beep. There we go. Finally. No rocks. What about this? Gonna pick a throw bucket.
[10710.97s -> 10718.31s]  Ooh, I have money in it. That's cool. So all of them have money in them. Um, I just got a fucking
[10718.31s -> 10739.86s]  item. Blood sucker. That's a little leechy. All right. Item room or just pray. Thank you.
[10739.86s -> 10759.34s]  And I have enough for an item in the item room. Look at that. Perfect. Too bad. Too bad. Wait,
[10759.34s -> 10768.49s]  what? Hold on. I can, I can hold it out. It's a lance. Deck of cards is good. Yeah,
[10768.49s -> 10785.02s]  but I have rock throw. Replace it. I mean, it won't replace it. This is a, oh, it's a passive.
[10785.02s -> 10794.49s]  I thought that was the, and there's the sun card. Okay. Well, I thought that was the one
[10794.49s -> 10808.04s]  that was the active that you had to activate. Let's keep going. It doesn't get the reference.
[10809.43s -> 10822.12s]  He hates Zelda. I don't, I don't play Zelda. I don't play Zelda. I play FPS games. I need money
[10822.12s -> 10829.16s]  for this. How do I cycle between the cards? Right? There we go. Yeah. I need money before I summon
[10829.16s -> 10848.04s]  him. Throw them, throw them all. The buckets seem to give you good shit. This game is literally
[10848.04s -> 10855.30s]  Zelda. It's not. It is literally star tropics. Sorry. It's not Zelda. It's star tropics.
[10856.10s -> 10886.06s]  It was inspired by Zelda. It was inspired by star tropics. Hard counter countered. This is really
[10886.06s -> 10910.23s]  fun. Get Ed on the line. It was inspired by star tropics. How are we doing? It was inspired by
[10910.23s -> 10917.98s]  the Bible. Wait, do I need to collect these? Why do I need these knife pieces? Why do I need these
[10917.98s -> 10933.75s]  knife piece of shit? Why do I need this knife piece of shit? I can't even use it. Do I have to get
[10933.75s -> 10954.15s]  the knife? This is a challenge. I can't believe that fucking hit me. Wasn't everything inspired
[10954.15s -> 10965.10s]  by the Bible? Fuck it. Thanks. Everything was inspired by the Bible. There's no bucket down
[10965.10s -> 10974.06s]  here. A lie. The Bible was inspired by the Bible. They made another one. They wrote like three of
[10974.06s -> 10992.74s]  them. Yeah, there's like the Old Testament and the New Testament. The Third Testament. I'm not
[10992.74s -> 11031.14s]  opening that door. Let's go. Oh, fuck. He's doing another move. Fuck you, man. Nice. HB up, tiers up,
[11031.14s -> 11050.81s]  shot speed down. Okay, so let's go. You're a walking cheese grater. Wood chipper. Laugh and
[11050.81s -> 11067.85s]  Jerma laughs with you. It worked. Have you ever considered that The Binding of Isaac was inspired
[11067.85s -> 11106.60s]  by Zelda? It was inspired by Star Tropic. Fool. All right, look for, uh, yep. March it, Spider Rock.
[11106.60s -> 11132.95s]  The Bible. Play it safe here. Just fire at them. You know what? I can't even get over there. There
[11132.95s -> 11140.62s]  we go. Stupid. Poked your head up. Coin on the table. There's a coin on the table. Jerma, coin
[11140.62s -> 11145.18s]  on table. Someone else will pick it up. I leave stuff behind sometimes so other people can like
[11145.18s -> 11159.86s]  have some fun and collect coins. I keep thinking this little leech guy is a bad guy. It should give
[11159.86s -> 11173.59s]  him like a big blue outline so I know. This game looks and plays nothing like Star Tropic. Um,
[11173.59s -> 11186.46s]  that's spoken like somebody that's never played one second of Star Tropic. Have you? I beat Star
[11186.46s -> 11208.60s]  Tropic when I was 11. I think I should know. Look at how much better I am with this melee involved.
[11208.60s -> 11221.83s]  Streaming. Star Tropic is grid based. This is not good. Okay, guys. I think it's time to
[11222.55s -> 11228.33s]  put this to rest for you once and for all. I think it's time to put this shit to rest.
[11229.93s -> 11302.97s]  Once and for all. Sorry. What, what are we watching right now? What's this? What? That little
[11302.97s -> 11311.96s]  fucking little maggots on the ground? This is, uh, Zelda. Zelda came before this. Oh, yeah.
[11312.92s -> 11319.08s]  No, it's inspired by Star Tropic. And by the way, the song is fucking, this song is an absolute
[11319.08s -> 11338.87s]  banger. Uh, uh, Mike, Mike Jones. I think this, that's the main character's name is Mike Jones,
[11338.87s -> 11343.43s]  right? He's going to be in the Smash Brothers DLC pack number two. He'll be the fifth person.
[11351.61s -> 11361.86s]  Now put on Zelda. When it starts, Zelda NES. I've never played Zelda. All right, let's put on
[11361.86s -> 11390.57s]  Zelda NES. Okay. This looks like a fucking wildly different game to me. What's going on here? What's
[11390.57s -> 11400.01s]  going on here? I don't want to play your fucking MMO. Get a move. Let's go. Oh my God. I don't
[11400.01s -> 11424.07s]  want to play Roblox. Oh, look at this. Just like Isaac, huh? Inspired by fucking Star Tropics.
[11424.07s -> 11433.78s]  By the way, Star Tropics came out December 1st, 1990. When the fuck did Zelda come out? 1993?
[11433.78s -> 11447.82s]  Yeah, I knew it. Zelda. Legend of Zelda. NES came out on, uh, February 21st, 1996. So sorry,
[11447.82s -> 11476.34s]  guys. That's not who copied who. Star Tropics. Fucking sick. You guys only played it. You would
[11476.34s -> 11489.22s]  know that it's inspired by, it's inspired the binding of Isaac. Wait, there were games before
[11489.22s -> 11502.52s]  Fortnite. Ow. I blocked projectiles. Why am I not using this? How am I not? I have so many keys.
[11502.52s -> 11530.90s]  Just go in. Isaac was inspired by GTA 3. I thought you could drive a car in this game. Oh, too bad.
[11530.90s -> 11550.81s]  Fucking relax. What the hell am I doing? Oh yeah. I'm done. I can't block those? Oh, that's not good.
[11551.77s -> 11561.74s]  See? I told you I could pick up the TNT. I can't. I can't pick up TNT. Fuck. I'm, I'm done. I'm done
[11561.74s -> 11582.12s]  for. I can't just use the only thing I'm good at, which is pressing a button very fast. Block every
[11582.12s -> 11603.51s]  shield. Oh, this sucks. Oh, fuck. This is bad. I can't get over there. Like, that thing's gotta...
[11614.09s -> 11633.83s]  Oh! I didn't block it. Fuck. All right. What? What? What? What? What? What? I made McMillan's
[11633.83s -> 11652.74s]  that. What are you? What? What? Let's copy Zelda and Meat Boy to copy Mario. Just make it
[11652.74s -> 11663.46s]  your own and be true. I know. Fucking Zelda is one of the inspirations. One of the many inspirations
[11664.42s -> 11683.96s]  of Binding of Isaac. Bomb this guy? Does it work? Doesn't work. It's one of the many inspirations
[11683.96s -> 11694.82s]  of Binding of Isaac. Star Tropic is one of them. You never mentioned Star Tropic once
[11694.82s -> 11730.71s]  ever in any interviews. Oh, come on. Are you sure? Okay. If you type, if you type it, this is where
[11730.71s -> 11739.78s]  it gets sad. When you type in Binding of Isaac Star Tropic, there are only four pages of results.
[11739.78s -> 11748.84s]  And when you get to page three or page two, you get, you're going back to like 2008 of,
[11750.68s -> 11765.08s]  that's almost impossible that there's three pages on Google. Look, I never said that it was the
[11765.08s -> 11771.88s]  direct inspiration for Isaac. I said it was one of the many factors in a long line of clearing
[11771.88s -> 11776.92s]  enemies in a room and then the door opens and using keys to go in those rooms. A long line of those
[11776.92s -> 11792.31s]  games is what I said. Binding of Isaac is directly inspired by Zelda, Star Tropic and viewers like
[11792.31s -> 11816.65s]  you. Coming up next is Arthur, episode 380. He gaslit himself. This is what happened.
[11822.17s -> 11831.16s]  There's a hot, there's a hot backpedal. What? I don't know. You play Star Tropic?
[11832.90s -> 11841.82s]  You'll see. There's items, an item shop in Star Tropic. There's little maggot enemies that go
[11843.58s -> 11876.65s]  when they fly over. Look, I know. I've played it. Fuck the technique. Yeah, well, thank you.
[11876.65s -> 11904.10s]  Give you some hearts. You know, not yet. Zelda had hearts. You bet they laugh. Yes, Star Tropic
[11904.10s -> 11908.92s]  had hearts too. Dermot, if you say the word Star Tropics again, I'm going to lose my mind.
[11913.14s -> 11925.53s]  Said like, okay, this is ridiculous. Unbelievable. That's unfucking believable. All right. Bite
[11925.53s -> 11949.98s]  them. Eat this guy. Eat them. Eat them. Eat them. Eat them. You're not eating them fast enough.
[11959.74s -> 11973.61s]  Eat everybody. Star Tropics had religious imagery and, well, Star Tropics was aliens.
[11974.17s -> 11991.10s]  So, I mean, they're fucking aliens in Zelda. Aliens in the Bible.
[11992.30s -> 12004.81s]  And then that is when, that is when Peter spoke upon the large alien creature when they landed in
[12004.81s -> 12030.71s]  their spaceship. Peter could be heard saying, look at this. You laughed at that. Don't even,
[12030.71s -> 12038.04s]  don't even start with me. You laughed at that. I know a couple of you didn't and you feel like
[12038.04s -> 12048.09s]  the fucked up. I didn't laugh at that shitty joke, but it's okay because I know for a fact
[12048.09s -> 12060.63s]  that at least a hundred thousand of you did. Okay. Can you, don't ever go against technique.
[12071.10s -> 12076.12s]  Any tinder rocks? Anybody see any? There's 5,000 people there. What do you mean?
[12076.76s -> 12099.14s]  What did I say? Jawbreaker. I see a tinted rock. Do you? Are you making that up or do you really
[12099.14s -> 12132.17s]  see one? I don't see one. Oh no. He lost 95,000 viewers. That would be bad. This sucks. This
[12132.17s -> 12139.21s]  sucks. All right. Eat them. Look, it's my guy versus your guy. You're a lot bigger and stronger,
[12139.21s -> 12168.68s]  but mine has more perseverance. Get him. He is doing the rat emo. Good work. A lot of you guys
[12168.68s -> 12197.48s]  over here. All right. You finished the job. Aha. That's two for two. I don't see a tinted rock,
[12197.48s -> 12216.15s]  but that's thanks for the input. Full health. I think I'm going to do this shit. I think we're
[12216.15s -> 12230.39s]  going to fucking be able to do this. All right, so bite him. Kill that one. Okay. I'll take out
[12230.39s -> 12247.22s]  this one. You get this one. Get him. Get him. Get him. Nice. Um, up there at top right. Okay. No
[12247.22s -> 12257.38s]  tinted rocks. Name the leech. Um, okay. I'll name the leech. How about, um, I think it's something
[12257.38s -> 12269.40s]  that I would be able to remember. Something I can remember. Uh, oh, here's something I could
[12269.40s -> 12273.72s]  always remember. Star tropics is a better game than Zelda. That could be that. That could be
[12273.72s -> 12303.34s]  his name. Easy to remember. He's never played Zelda. Watch out. What do I do? Oh, I don't know.
[12303.34s -> 12319.08s]  Maybe I can't get over there. Oh no. No. Oh, it's okay. I was going to say he's not my friend
[12319.08s -> 12369.11s]  anymore. Oh my God. There's a teleporter. What? Blow it up, right? Blow up the head. Wow. You know
[12369.11s -> 12380.57s]  what the, you know what the Zelda game was? I'm being honest. I mean, Ocarina of Time's great.
[12380.57s -> 12403.64s]  Um, I still play Breath of the Wild, but keep up the pressure. Keep the pressure up. Don't even
[12403.64s -> 12415.83s]  let him attack. Just keep the pressure up. Casino. Stream Breath of the Wild, please.
[12416.39s -> 12436.07s]  I would probably really like it. Another dumb card that nobody wants. Um, speed up. I'll take it.
[12440.01s -> 12447.46s]  All right. Here we go. Give me some stuff. No, I want to blow these up and I don't even want
[12447.46s -> 12462.82s]  to do anything. Oh, come on. I want money from these. It's like the game can't even hear me.
[12462.82s -> 12490.39s]  You can't hear. Hello. Can you hear me talk? I'm going for it. Come on. Oh, he stepped on his head.
[12491.35s -> 12510.23s]  Fuck. Okay. She knew. I can come back with more money. Why can I pick up these rocks?
[12510.23s -> 12526.71s]  Pick it up, man. Pick up the rock. Where's my face cam? Sometimes I don't have my face cam on
[12526.71s -> 12532.26s]  because I don't want to be on face cam. Sometimes I'm camera shy and I don't want to be on cam.
[12533.14s -> 12542.79s]  All right. Finish the job. And yes, I don't have any clothes on. People think that's a joke. They
[12542.79s -> 12546.79s]  really do. And that's fine. It's actually probably better that way that you think that that is just
[12546.79s -> 12553.62s]  me messing around. But I am sitting here right now. I don't have a shirt on and I'm in pajama
[12553.62s -> 12564.82s]  pants. And you'll never know if that's true. No. You know what? No, fuck it. I'm wearing a suit.
[12565.38s -> 12588.86s]  I'm in a tuxedo right now. Do I need to do this? Wait. Fires. All right. Fires, right? Holy shit.
[12589.50s -> 12613.93s]  No. Who's this going to take me? Oh, interesting. Interesting. That's interesting.
[12613.93s -> 12631.35s]  Oh, what the fuck? Why? What the fuck? Oh, they shoot. I forgot the purple ones shoot too. It's
[12631.35s -> 12644.33s]  just a net zero. Wink. I don't do winks anymore. I'm not that guy. I don't do that anymore.
[12644.89s -> 12666.74s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me. One more for the road. No. Is there a reason why I cannot pick up
[12666.74s -> 12684.17s]  rocks anymore with this gauntlet? I can't pick up rocks. They're special rocks. I'm not talking to
[12684.17s -> 12705.43s]  you until you wink. Are they going to keep splitting? I'm going to just come on. Do I
[12705.43s -> 12724.76s]  actually have to do this? Oh, guess. Good thing I got the bomb back. Oh my god. Oh my god. Omega.
[12724.76s -> 12737.21s]  Oh my god. Fucking maca. Omega. Oh, I see what's going on. I see what's going on. Oh, you're not

[17844.26s -> 17851.32s]  oh there's another secret pocket that i could kill them up before they touch me
[17852.12s -> 17856.79s]  i need my memory when he said it was going to be a maximum four hours isaac's stream
[17859.62s -> 17866.30s]  that's true i did say that but also remember um if you weren't here earlier this stream is
[17866.30s -> 17874.42s]  probably not going to be very much longer i'm trying to take it easy i've had some annoying
[17874.42s -> 17884.09s]  pain because you've uh those of you that know the yeah yada yada yada uh i was kind of hurting the
[17884.09s -> 17889.77s]  other day and i'm kind of hurting now but i took some advil and i'm like okay now but
[17890.73s -> 17899.34s]  this is like i can't sit here i can't do like an eight hour session here it really is the worst
[17899.34s -> 17906.79s]  because like like sitting down actually does make it worse after like five plus hours what i'll
[17906.79s -> 17915.54s]  probably have to end up doing is i'm probably gonna get a standing desk and see if it helps
[17925.77s -> 17937.27s]  so it's on it's on the table tape yourself to the ceiling what because i have noticed that
[17939.35s -> 17946.17s]  lying down is all right like i'll wake up in the morning and i'm kind of stiff but and like moving
[17946.17s -> 17949.93s]  around if i'm like walking around and moving around you i'm like usually i'm like okay
[17951.05s -> 17956.39s]  it's not as bad as it is we're just seated something about the seated position even with
[17956.39s -> 17961.03s]  like good posture and with a brace on something about it i don't know it's like somehow it's
[17961.03s -> 17968.63s]  compressing my spine and rib cage and um making my issue already it's there worse
[17969.51s -> 17977.67s]  oh there's a credit card good thing you just used it for no reason oh that's good luck up
[17978.47s -> 17992.14s]  get a hanging from get a hanging roller coaster chair that would actually be pretty cool
[17993.02s -> 18004.94s]  well we're gonna fill this room with shit i thought there were no item rooms
[18006.39s -> 18014.73s]  in the challenges wait what how is there item room in here get a lumbar roller i have one already
[18017.16s -> 18025.16s]  i'm doing physical therapy i have trust me if there's a device to help with like
[18025.16s -> 18032.04s]  potential costochondritis like arthritis i've i've probably used it or tried it
[18035.35s -> 18049.77s]  i've tried it some of them help some of them make it worse is that a tinted rock fuck it's not
[18050.49s -> 18070.68s]  but well marijuana is true uh although here's the issue okay i'm gonna give you guys the real
[18070.68s -> 18078.42s]  the we're gonna get real talk time okay so um of course like something like marijuana i mean it's
[18078.42s -> 18086.47s]  legal in las vegas it's completely recreationally legal here's the problem um if i smoke weed or if
[18086.47s -> 18094.57s]  i do like cbd like if i do if i smoke weed i i can't stream i can't like do anything
[18095.53s -> 18104.30s]  i just sit in like a room and just i i'm already so scatterbrained and so fucked up and so adhd
[18105.66s -> 18118.52s]  no i can't do anything like imagine if i like smoked and then screamed it'd be like you you
[18118.52s -> 18124.73s]  don't want to watch that stream and then but there's also like just oh there we go got it
[18125.75s -> 18133.29s]  finally um yeah there's also just cbd oil which you can just have this you can have no thc in it
[18133.29s -> 18143.02s]  or anything but yeah i actually have done it before i had a bottle it was like little droplets i would
[18143.02s -> 18169.54s]  put under my tongue i had tried it before go to chiropractor well um the theory is do i'm doing
[18169.54s -> 18176.68s]  stuff physical therapy first so once physical therapy is like hey this is gonna work or this
[18176.68s -> 18194.28s]  is not gonna work that's what we're doing first chiropractors are shit yeah but part of me is also
[18194.28s -> 18201.43s]  in that boat right now where i mean it i i gotta get like a clear clear picture of exactly what's
[18201.43s -> 18210.06s]  going on and right now it's like okay you might have this like prostagunditis but now you might
[18210.14s -> 18213.02s]  have rheumatoid arthritis rheumatoid
[18216.82s -> 18224.79s]  apparently i have a high rheumatoid factor i did a blood test for it and i don't know
[18224.79s -> 18237.27s]  we're gonna check it out and we're gonna see and here's the thing it's i have autoimmune problems
[18237.27s -> 18247.69s]  already like the colitis thing that's autoimmune ra is autoimmune so the doctor was like you know
[18247.69s -> 18263.22s]  it's not against the realm of all possibility that it could you could just have ra and like okay but
[18264.23s -> 18272.92s]  once there's a clear indicator of what is actually fucking going on that's when you know you if it's
[18272.92s -> 18277.56s]  something if i have fucking like arthritis then whatever i have arthritis and you take medicine
[18277.56s -> 18281.96s]  for it you manage it and you'll be you're fine you'll be all right you might have good days you
[18281.96s -> 18288.15s]  might have bad days but you know you're still doing it see right now the problem is i'm not
[18288.15s -> 18294.15s]  being really treated for anything like we're like throwing darts and none of those darts have really
[18294.15s -> 18299.75s]  landed it significantly in any area that is like yeah that's definitive that's exactly what's going
[18299.75s -> 18306.44s]  on and uh while i uh talk to my friend on the telephone and just walk into every enemy
[18315.40s -> 18329.58s]  fuck throwing spaghetti at the ceiling you'll have problems getting into your clown car but
[18329.58s -> 18338.33s]  you can still stream yeah i'm not i'm not it i'm trying just to stay it's really easy to get
[18338.33s -> 18344.81s]  frustrated at something like this because when i when i have the camera on you probably see me like
[18344.81s -> 18353.99s]  lean back and like spread and it's like it's kind of why i'm doing that just do shrooms

[18872.76s -> 18885.58s]  because of the thing i just got that's good ah the fucking tnt changes every boss wave

[18965.83s -> 18987.80s]  let's see candle candle it pastel candle gives minus one tier delay for each room completed
[18987.80s -> 18994.73s]  without taking damage up to a maximum of minus six so as long as you don't get hit you get tears
[18994.73s -> 19007.18s]  up every room but that's not too i mean i'd rather just not take damage sometimes yeah i'd rather
[19007.18s -> 19018.84s]  just like not take damage sometimes blow up the angel right right that's tick yeah i didn't have
[19018.84s -> 19027.72s]  any more bombs oh we're gonna open the door open open open open go go go go he sucks i i hey come

[19184.50s -> 19191.21s]  this is actually the worst item in the whole game by far that's the one where if you take damage it

[24074.38s -> 24080.97s]  works before i do any of that so initially i'm just probably going to play the game the way it's
[24080.97s -> 24089.69s]  intended to be played the first day maybe depending on what it does marv ash mcgalley
