[2.42s -> 8.74s]  Hey, what's going on, everybody? Jerma here with just a little update vlog telling you where I've been the last couple of days.
[8.74s -> 13.38s]  While you haven't seen really any videos in a couple days here. I just got back from North Carolina.
[13.38s -> 19.30s]  I actually just landed. The plane landed like 30 seconds ago. That's not true. It landed like 40 minutes ago
[19.30s -> 23.22s]  because it takes a while to get off the plane and then get in a car and drive to my house.
[23.22s -> 29.80s]  But I just got back from the baby's house. Well, my sister's house in North Carolina.
[29.88s -> 36.36s]  And it was a great trip. It was awesome. And those of you guys that have become uncles or have had, even if you've had kids on your own,
[36.36s -> 43.94s]  you know that holding a baby and seeing like a baby, it's a lot different when you actually get to have your hands on them
[43.94s -> 51.14s]  and like cuddle them and rock them and stuff. It's really, really cool. And it's quite a humbling experience as you're watching me here
[51.14s -> 58.10s]  with the baby right now. I never like have held a baby before. And this is like kind of probably going to sound odd to some of you guys.
[58.10s -> 65.38s]  But I've never held a baby before. Ever. Never in my entire life. This is the first time I've ever done it because I'm kind of,
[65.38s -> 71.38s]  I'm kind of afraid to do it. Like I've always been kind of scared to, oh, let me hold my baby for me.
[71.38s -> 76.07s]  Like I don't, I don't want to do that. Like for some reason I've just never wanted to do it.
[76.07s -> 81.91s]  But when you have a connection with a kid, when you have a direct blood relation, it's like a sister's,
[81.91s -> 87.27s]  your sister's kid, your brother's kid or something, it's a lot different. And you really want to just like
[88.23s -> 95.42s]  hold the baby. Like the one thing I wanted to do that, right when I got on the house, I was like, I want to hold that baby immediately.
[95.42s -> 100.46s]  And of course, everybody wanted to, because I mean, the baby gets passed around to all the family members,
[100.46s -> 105.74s]  because there was a lot of us there. There was my brother-in-law's side and me and my brother and my sister,
[105.74s -> 109.82s]  obviously. My sister's the one that had the baby. And my parents, there was just a lot of people there, friends there.
[109.82s -> 116.30s]  So everybody, the baby kind of got like passed around. It was pretty ridiculous. But when it was my turn, oh my God,
[116.30s -> 121.42s]  I like sat there and just stared at the baby and just wanted to see like, what is this baby thinking?
[121.42s -> 126.70s]  And I mean, I'm going off on kind of a tangent here and I wanted to make this video kind of less than
[126.70s -> 131.27s]  like two or three minutes just to let you know where I've been. But it's a really humbling experience.
[131.27s -> 139.00s]  It's a really almost life-changing experience, if I can really say that. And all I can really say is I feel great.
[139.00s -> 145.00s]  I feel awesome. I'm glad that I was able to be a part of that. I was at the baptism. I was standing there.
[145.00s -> 151.96s]  I did a reading for the baptism. I mean, I'm not like a really highly religious guy, but it still was cool to do that
[151.96s -> 158.12s]  and be part of that. But before this video kind of gets longer than I wanted it to, I'm going to wrap it up here, guys.
[158.12s -> 164.12s]  Just hope you enjoy the little clips in the background while I talked about life and babies and spies.
[164.12s -> 170.55s]  Well, that wasn't technically a baby spie. That was a baby harper. And I can't wait to see her again,
[170.71s -> 174.95s]  probably Christmas time or Thanksgiving. And I'm going to let the video play out, guys.
[174.95s -> 178.95s]  I'm going to talk to you guys all next time. Thank you all so much for watching. Really do appreciate it.
[178.95s -> 182.95s]  I'm back in action tomorrow. I got a lot of stuff planned for the next couple days.
[182.95s -> 186.95s]  I got a lot of stuff planned in general. Just stay tuned, baby. Just stay tuned.
[186.95s -> 191.13s]  All right, guys. I'll see you all next time. And of course, take care, everybody.
