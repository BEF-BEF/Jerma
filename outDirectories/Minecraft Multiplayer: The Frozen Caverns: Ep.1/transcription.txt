[0.31s -> 8.59s]  Minecraft, Minecraft, Minecraft.
[8.59s -> 11.59s]  Oops, that was the wrong one, wasn't it?
[11.59s -> 14.28s]  Hey, what is going on everybody?
[14.28s -> 17.28s]  Jerma here with a new Minecraft series.
[17.28s -> 19.28s]  And a lot of people have been asking me.
[19.28s -> 22.28s]  They said, Jerma, what happened to JermaCraft?
[22.28s -> 24.28s]  I know you ended it at that 10 episodes,
[24.28s -> 26.28s]  but are we gonna get any more Minecraft?
[26.28s -> 28.28s]  And here's the answer.
[28.28s -> 31.58s]  Absolutely, my friend.
[31.58s -> 32.58s]  And on the screen right now,
[32.58s -> 35.58s]  I'll give you a couple of lowdown of the maps and who I'm playing with.
[35.58s -> 38.58s]  So the map is gonna be the Frozen Caverns,
[38.58s -> 40.58s]  is the name of this survival map.
[40.58s -> 43.58s]  And I'm not sure how far I'm gonna go with this.
[43.58s -> 45.58s]  I'm not sure how many episodes.
[45.58s -> 47.58s]  I don't think I'm gonna have like 55 million episodes.
[47.58s -> 50.58s]  But I'm gonna get enough where you guys can see some of the funny things,
[50.58s -> 53.58s]  some of the highlights, some of the interesting things that happened.
[53.58s -> 55.58s]  And the people in this video, this is with Lepter1,
[55.58s -> 58.58s]  who a lot of you know of, and Italics.
[58.58s -> 61.58s]  And both of those links, of course, will be in the description.
[61.58s -> 62.58s]  Go check them out.
[62.58s -> 65.58s]  Two cool dudes in my personal opinion.
[65.58s -> 67.58s]  So what do you say we get this started?
[67.58s -> 69.58s]  And before I go any further, I forgot to mention,
[69.58s -> 74.58s]  both of these two guys, they're gonna be doing videos of this series on their own channels.
[74.58s -> 76.58s]  So if you want to see it from somebody else's perspective
[76.58s -> 79.58s]  or from a different viewpoint, then definitely go check them out.
[79.58s -> 80.89s]  So let's get this started now.
[80.89s -> 82.89s]  Everybody, I hope you enjoy the video.
[82.89s -> 83.89s]  And I will see you all soon.
[83.89s -> 85.89s]  Take care, everybody.
[85.89s -> 86.89s]  Zombie up here.
[86.89s -> 88.38s]  Oh, don't worry, take care.
[88.38s -> 91.65s]  The zombie's got nothing.
[91.65s -> 94.23s]  Oh, God.
[94.23s -> 95.23s]  Oh, God.
[95.23s -> 97.23s]  I just said something.
[97.23s -> 99.23s]  Something just exploded.
[99.23s -> 102.30s]  That would be me.
[102.30s -> 104.30s]  This guy is like whooping my butt.
[104.30s -> 109.18s]  It's okay, I'm just collecting a ton of snowballs
[109.18s -> 112.18s]  from which we will make a ton.
[112.18s -> 114.18s]  And I mean a ton.
[114.18s -> 115.18s]  We've got a tag team this guy.
[115.18s -> 116.18s]  There we go.
[116.18s -> 119.18s]  Okay, we were just like hammering on that guy and he didn't die.
[119.18s -> 120.55s]  All right, what do we have in here?
[120.55s -> 123.98s]  We have some leather and we have some fishing rods.
[123.98s -> 124.98s]  Fishing rods.
[124.98s -> 125.98s]  I will fish.
[125.98s -> 126.98s]  We can make food.
[126.98s -> 127.98s]  Yeah.
[127.98s -> 128.98s]  We can make armor with that, can't we?
[128.98s -> 129.98s]  We have an Enderman up there.
[129.98s -> 130.98s]  Yes.
[130.98s -> 132.86s]  All right.
[132.86s -> 134.86s]  I dare you to throw a snowball at the Enderman.
[134.86s -> 135.86s]  Dare you.
[139.74s -> 140.74s]  What?
[140.74s -> 141.74s]  He's gone.
[141.74s -> 142.74s]  I don't even know where he went.
[142.74s -> 143.74s]  Hold on.
[143.74s -> 145.74s]  Oh, there he is.
[145.74s -> 149.18s]  Oh, this is not going to end well.
[149.18s -> 152.18s]  You can't double dog dare me.
[152.18s -> 154.80s]  I'll always do it.
[154.80s -> 155.80s]  No, I'm running.
[155.80s -> 158.80s]  Lepter is using up the fishing rod on the Enderman.
[158.80s -> 163.51s]  Get out of here, you tall bastard.
[163.51s -> 168.07s]  Jerma, you can jump and do crit hits.
[168.07s -> 169.07s]  Yeah.
[169.07s -> 170.07s]  My food.
[170.07s -> 173.07s]  All right, so that was good.
[173.07s -> 176.07s]  I've already got six rotten flesh.
[176.07s -> 179.07s]  All right, so before taking on hard areas, prepare yourself.
[179.07s -> 180.07s]  That's over here.
[180.07s -> 181.07s]  Oh, skeleton.
[181.07s -> 183.07s]  Watch out, there's a skeleton on your left.
[183.07s -> 186.21s]  Jump and crit this guy.
[189.37s -> 193.99s]  Man, we are not even going to make it out of the starting.
[193.99s -> 194.99s]  He is freaking out.
[194.99s -> 195.99s]  OK.
[195.99s -> 198.99s]  All right, so is there anything else that we need to know about this place?
[198.99s -> 202.38s]  Maybe underneath.
[202.38s -> 204.38s]  I'm going ice fishing, baby.
[204.38s -> 205.38s]  Should we go down?
[205.38s -> 208.38s]  But the point is we're trying to find records, right?
[208.38s -> 213.38s]  Right, but we also have to find supplies to live off of.
[213.38s -> 217.38s]  Well, I'm sinking like a goddamn rock.
[217.38s -> 218.38s]  Oh, God.
[218.38s -> 222.38s]  All right, just use the charge attacks to push them back.
[222.38s -> 224.38s]  Wait, what do you mean charge attack?
[224.38s -> 227.38s]  If you double tap, you sprint, and then if you hit them while sprinting,
[227.38s -> 228.38s]  it pushes them back.
[228.38s -> 230.88s]  I got a bone.
[230.88s -> 232.88s]  What just happened?
[232.88s -> 235.88s]  Good job luring.
[235.88s -> 240.70s]  Jerma ran right in there.
[240.70s -> 243.70s]  I used my charge and dodge.
[243.70s -> 248.70s]  This was a nice ice cave until that fateful explosion.
[248.70s -> 249.70s]  There's a sign up here, guys.
[249.70s -> 251.70s]  I knew I saw something earlier.
[251.70s -> 252.70s]  Really?
[252.70s -> 255.51s]  Well, look at this hallway.
[255.51s -> 257.88s]  This looks eerie.
[257.88s -> 259.88s]  All right, I'm making some more snow.
[259.88s -> 260.88s]  I'll be back to check on that.
[260.88s -> 261.88s]  There's something else in there, guys.
[261.88s -> 263.88s]  We'll have to go back in a second.
[263.88s -> 264.88s]  We'll die.
[264.88s -> 265.88s]  Is there?
[265.88s -> 266.88s]  A lot.
[266.88s -> 267.88s]  So it's OK.
[267.88s -> 270.38s]  Junction one, no records.
[270.38s -> 271.38s]  What does that mean?
[271.38s -> 272.38s]  Oh.
[272.38s -> 273.38s]  Start.
[273.38s -> 274.38s]  I got it.
[274.38s -> 275.38s]  Start your zone one record.
[275.38s -> 277.38s]  Oh, no.
[277.38s -> 278.38s]  Bye, Lepter.
[278.38s -> 279.38s]  Oh, no.
[279.38s -> 281.38s]  Did you guys just both fall off?
[281.38s -> 282.38s]  Yes.
[282.38s -> 283.38s]  How am I still up here?
[283.38s -> 285.38s]  I'm like the stupid one of the group.
[285.38s -> 287.38s]  There's a hole in the glass.
[287.38s -> 290.19s]  Oh, I'm looking through it right now.
[290.19s -> 294.19s]  I'm like right below the bridge.
[294.19s -> 295.19s]  Stay here.
[295.19s -> 299.19s]  Just take this stuff and keep it safe.
[299.19s -> 300.19s]  OK.
[300.19s -> 302.19s]  Just don't fall.
[302.19s -> 303.19s]  Hey, guys.
[303.19s -> 305.19s]  There's skeletons in that tower.
[305.19s -> 306.19s]  I know.
[306.19s -> 307.19s]  Watch out.
[307.19s -> 308.19s]  I'm going to get knocked down by them.
[308.19s -> 309.19s]  It's going to be gruesome.
[309.19s -> 312.19s]  It's going to be like the other recording, you and I.
[312.19s -> 315.19s]  Oh, we should not have thrown all those snowballs.
[315.19s -> 317.19s]  Yeah, I need them.
[317.19s -> 319.19s]  Dude, those archers are just aiming for you.
[319.19s -> 321.19s]  You're going to get like toasted.
[321.19s -> 322.19s]  I'm past them.
[322.19s -> 324.19s]  There's a chest all the way down there, though.
[324.19s -> 325.19s]  All right.
[325.19s -> 327.19s]  So I got over to here.
[327.19s -> 330.19s]  I'm going to fill in any blatant holes.
[330.19s -> 332.19s]  So we have at least like a two block.
[332.19s -> 334.19s]  Are they shooting at you?
[334.19s -> 336.19s]  No, I'm just like throwing snowballs at them.
[336.19s -> 338.19s]  We need to make the snowballs into snowballs.
[338.19s -> 341.19s]  Don't throw snowballs.
[341.19s -> 346.01s]  I didn't figure that out until it was too late.
[346.01s -> 347.01s]  All right.
[347.01s -> 349.01s]  Look over there in the corner with all those.
[349.01s -> 351.01s]  I got over here.
[351.01s -> 353.01s]  Should we follow you?
[353.01s -> 354.01s]  Well, you can.
[354.01s -> 355.01s]  I mean, don't fall.
[355.01s -> 356.01s]  Run.
[356.01s -> 357.01s]  Yeah.
[357.01s -> 358.01s]  No, don't run.
[358.01s -> 359.01s]  You don't need to run.
[359.01s -> 360.01s]  Oh, no, don't run.
[360.01s -> 361.01s]  You're out of their reach.
[361.01s -> 363.27s]  That's not a good idea.
[363.27s -> 365.27s]  And watch out for the holes in the ground.
[365.27s -> 366.27s]  Yeah.
[366.27s -> 367.27s]  Watch out.
[367.27s -> 368.27s]  I'm filling in a two wide.
[368.27s -> 369.27s]  How do you make those blocks?
[369.27s -> 370.27s]  Is it four snowballs?
[370.27s -> 372.27s]  Yeah, it's a four snowball thing.
[372.27s -> 373.58s]  All right.
[373.58s -> 378.58s]  So if you guys walk here, it's black ice caves.
[378.58s -> 379.58s]  I have one record.
[379.58s -> 387.01s]  Good thing we didn't make, you know, leather stuff.
[387.01s -> 389.01s]  I just fell in the lava.
[389.01s -> 390.01s]  Yeah.
[390.01s -> 391.01s]  Oh, you fell in the lava?
[391.01s -> 392.01s]  Yeah.
[392.01s -> 394.01s]  That was that was what the was.
[394.01s -> 396.01s]  Oh, that was what that noise was.
[396.01s -> 397.01s]  Yes.
[397.01s -> 398.01s]  That's what that was.
[399.01s -> 401.01s]  I'm about to run out of food.
[401.01s -> 403.01s]  I got I got 13 blocks.
[403.01s -> 405.01s]  There's a tree down there.
[405.01s -> 406.01s]  That's what we need.
[406.01s -> 407.01s]  All right.
[407.01s -> 408.01s]  I'm going to get that tree.
[408.01s -> 409.95s]  All right.
[409.95s -> 412.95s]  So I'm going to fall and I'm going to die.
[412.95s -> 415.90s]  No, you don't say that.
[415.90s -> 417.90s]  I can't believe I died.
[417.90s -> 419.90s]  I see more of those.
[419.90s -> 420.90s]  Take more of these blocks.
[420.90s -> 425.22s]  Take some more of that ice cream.
[425.22s -> 427.23s]  Is that all you have?
[427.23s -> 430.60s]  Yeah, that's all I have.
[431.60s -> 433.60s]  I thought we were saved for a second.
[433.60s -> 434.60s]  Jerma comes to the rescue.
[434.60s -> 435.60s]  No.
[435.60s -> 436.60s]  Oh, I know.
[436.60s -> 438.60s]  Wait, maybe, maybe we do because I have a bunch of clay.
[438.60s -> 439.60s]  All right.
[439.60s -> 442.60s]  I got down here.
[442.60s -> 448.60s]  Oh, we have mine carts and mine tracks, which are useless to us.
[448.60s -> 449.60s]  Here we have some.
[449.60s -> 452.60s]  I'm going to get this tree down.
[452.60s -> 453.60s]  Cut this tree down.
[453.60s -> 455.60s]  We need to save it for Christmas.
[455.60s -> 456.60s]  That is a Christmas tree.
[456.60s -> 459.78s]  If I ever saw one, it's it's nighttime.
[459.78s -> 460.78s]  It's nighttime, guys.
[460.78s -> 463.78s]  Just let you know.
[463.78s -> 466.78s]  So we got to build a shelter like ASAP.
[466.78s -> 470.78s]  It's about to get real nasty.
[470.78s -> 474.98s]  We missed what you missed the block of wood up there.
[474.98s -> 479.11s]  Oh, look down here, guys.
[479.11s -> 483.17s]  Oh, you guys.
[483.17s -> 484.17s]  OK.
[484.17s -> 485.17s]  Oh, my God.
[485.17s -> 486.17s]  I just.
[486.17s -> 487.17s]  Oh, my God.
[487.17s -> 488.17s]  I'm OK.
[488.17s -> 489.17s]  Lepter.
[489.17s -> 490.17s]  I'm not OK.
[490.17s -> 491.17s]  I died.
[491.17s -> 492.17s]  What happened?
[492.17s -> 495.17s]  I dropped down on a pressure plate.
[495.17s -> 499.17s]  Oh, there's just like pressure bomb plates all over the place.
[499.17s -> 500.17s]  Apparently.
[500.17s -> 501.17s]  I will not.
[501.17s -> 502.17s]  Oh, my God.
[502.17s -> 505.17s]  So should I eat this bread parkour over that zombie?
[505.17s -> 506.17s]  What?
[506.17s -> 507.17s]  How hungry are you?
[507.17s -> 508.17s]  How bad are you?
[508.17s -> 509.17s]  I'm not that hungry, but I'm going to die.
[509.17s -> 510.17s]  He's going to make it past the creeper.
[510.17s -> 511.17s]  Yes, he does.
[511.17s -> 513.17s]  If you are going to die, then go ahead and eat it.
[513.17s -> 514.17s]  All right.
[514.17s -> 515.17s]  I'm going to eat it.
[515.17s -> 516.17s]  Oh, God.
[516.17s -> 518.43s]  That was delicious.
[518.43s -> 520.43s]  What did what did you eat?
[520.43s -> 524.61s]  What was your bread selection?
[524.61s -> 527.61s]  It was a piece of old stale sourdough bread.
[527.61s -> 530.36s]  It's all in your mind, man.
[530.36s -> 532.36s]  That was probably like artisan bread.
[532.36s -> 535.66s]  You know, that was like like cheese bread.
