[0.31s -> 14.76s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jermah here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[14.76s -> 18.76s]  And today, tonight, tonight, whatever time it is whenever you're watching this video.
[18.76s -> 24.76s]  I know I say tonight a lot in these commentaries, but that's just because I happen to be making these at nighttime.
[24.76s -> 27.76s]  So anyways, let's get out of there and let's talk about what I want to discuss in this video.
[27.76s -> 32.76s]  First of all, I'm playing as the Demoman with the lock and load, the strange lock and load.
[32.76s -> 37.76s]  The sticky bomb launcher, I believe that is strange as well, and the half satoshi.
[37.76s -> 41.76s]  I think everything is strange, my goodness gracious. How many things do I have that are strange?
[41.76s -> 46.00s]  But anyways, let's move on to the commentary. This is not going to talk about the gameplay really at all.
[46.00s -> 51.00s]  But it has to do with gameplay or gaming in general.
[51.00s -> 57.18s]  And it's going to be, if you've seen from the title of this video, how to get better at online gaming.
[57.18s -> 62.18s]  Now this is not just Team Fortress 2. This could be any of these competitive online games.
[62.18s -> 66.18s]  It could be any game where you're playing against somebody else, where there's somebody on the other team.
[66.18s -> 70.74s]  You're fighting against another actual human being in a competitive atmosphere.
[70.74s -> 74.74s]  So whenever I get asked this question, or I'm sure whenever you guys get asked this question as well,
[74.74s -> 79.74s]  some of you guys that have been playing games for a very long time, your response probably goes something like this.
[79.74s -> 83.74s]  When somebody says, oh hey, how do you get better at that game? How do you get better at Team Fortress?
[83.74s -> 87.74s]  How do you get better at Smite? I'm bad at Battlefield. What do I do?
[87.74s -> 89.74s]  Usually the answer goes something like this.
[89.74s -> 93.91s]  Well, if you want to get better, you have to practice and you have to play the game.
[93.91s -> 100.15s]  Which is true, but that's not entirely 100% all you have to do.
[100.15s -> 104.15s]  If it were that easy, if all you had to do was turn the game on and play it for a long time,
[104.15s -> 107.33s]  I would be really good at a lot of games that I'm not that good at.
[107.33s -> 112.33s]  But what you have to do, guys, this is the best advice I can give to getting better at an online game,
[112.33s -> 116.50s]  you have to know what everybody can do.
[116.50s -> 119.50s]  And I'm talking about not players.
[119.50s -> 123.68s]  I'm talking about generally what classes can do, what types of abilities they have,
[123.68s -> 128.68s]  how to get out of those abilities, how to find yourself in a better situation, et cetera, et cetera.
[128.68s -> 133.68s]  Now let me be perfectly clear here. Let me try and make this as easy as I can.
[133.68s -> 140.92s]  If you start playing Team Fortress and you jump on as the scout, you need to play not only as the scout,
[140.92s -> 144.92s]  but you need to put equal time into the soldier, the spy, the engineer.
[144.92s -> 148.92s]  You need to play as everybody to know what everybody can do.
[148.92s -> 151.92s]  And you need to know all the situations, all the weapons.
[151.92s -> 153.92s]  Like you're talking about a game like Battlefield.
[153.92s -> 157.92s]  Get familiar with all the guns. Find out everything about the game.
[157.92s -> 164.92s]  Because then you'll know in every single situation what you would have done and ways to avoid yourself,
[164.92s -> 167.22s]  if that makes any sense.
[167.22s -> 170.22s]  Because there's a limited amount of things that you can really do in these games.
[170.22s -> 175.22s]  And once you find out, once you play as these classes or these heroes or use these abilities,
[175.22s -> 181.22s]  you're going to know exactly how they work and ways that you would be able to get around them.
[181.22s -> 185.22s]  For instance, if you're playing against a scout that has the Force of Nature,
[185.22s -> 189.22s]  you know if you play with it and you use it, you know exactly the ups and downs of that weapon.
[189.22s -> 194.22s]  So you'll be able to kill the person using it because you know exactly what they're going to do.
[194.22s -> 198.22s]  And to follow that up a little bit, head on over to some of these games' wiki pages.
[198.22s -> 201.22s]  They are very, very helpful.
[201.22s -> 204.22s]  I have read so many articles on the Team Fortress wiki.
[204.22s -> 206.22s]  Same thing as the Smite wiki. Same thing.
[206.22s -> 211.53s]  When I used to play World of Warcraft, I would always be at wowhead.com.
[211.53s -> 216.53s]  Just to get myself educated on certain things, finding out drop rates, finding out this and that.
[216.53s -> 221.53s]  Wiki pages are an absolute blessing when it comes to learning games and getting better at them.
[221.53s -> 228.33s]  So before this video is over, I want to bring up the last point I want to make on online gaming and getting better at it.
[228.33s -> 230.33s]  You are going to get frustrated.
[230.33s -> 234.33s]  It is going to happen, especially if you're going to play one of these competitive online games.
[234.33s -> 236.33s]  You are going to get mad.
[236.33s -> 240.33s]  It's going to happen because you're getting thrown into an environment you've never been in before.
[240.33s -> 245.33s]  You're going to get killed by guys that have been playing the game for years, potentially months, years, whatever it ends up being.
[245.33s -> 247.33s]  And you're going to get mad.
[247.33s -> 251.33s]  And that's growing, period, guys, because every time you die in one of these games,
[251.33s -> 254.33s]  you're going to kind of analyze how you died.
[254.33s -> 257.33s]  You go over it in your head a little bit and you say, you know, I'm not going to let that happen again.
[257.33s -> 262.33s]  And eventually when that happens a ton of times and you know all these situations that you've died in,
[262.33s -> 268.63s]  you're going to start to see yourself creep higher and higher and higher up the scoreboard because it's just learning.
[268.63s -> 270.63s]  It's all just a learning process.
[270.63s -> 273.63s]  It's all just going up in your brain and your noggin up there.
[273.63s -> 276.63s]  Every time you lose, every time you fail, you're learning something else.
[276.63s -> 278.63s]  So it's OK to fail.
[278.63s -> 280.63s]  It's OK to die in these games.
[280.63s -> 283.63s]  Don't get too frustrated because it's going to happen to everybody.
[283.63s -> 288.00s]  It's very, very rare for someone to turn a game on that they've never played before
[288.00s -> 291.00s]  and just start top-fragging and being an absolute pro.
[291.00s -> 293.00s]  It doesn't really happen.
[293.00s -> 296.00s]  And if it does happen and for some reason you've played a game that you never played before
[296.00s -> 299.00s]  and you're really, really good at it, then that's really awesome.
[299.00s -> 303.00s]  Good for you because it takes usually a lot of time before you get to that level.
[303.00s -> 307.62s]  So to bring this all full circle, let's just do a little recap here.
[307.62s -> 312.62s]  40% practice, 40% knowing all the information in all the situations,
[312.62s -> 314.62s]  and 20% failure.
[314.62s -> 319.62s]  That is my personal formula to get better at online gaming.
[319.62s -> 323.86s]  And also, real quickly, make sure you're having fun during this whole process
[323.86s -> 325.86s]  because if you're not having fun while you're playing a game,
[325.86s -> 327.86s]  then the game isn't really doing its job.
[327.86s -> 330.86s]  You really need to have as much fun as you possibly can with these games
[330.86s -> 332.86s]  because that's what they're there for.
[332.86s -> 338.49s]  They're there for you to play, to enjoy, and not to lose your mind over.
[338.49s -> 340.49s]  So that is going to wrap up the video, guys.
[340.49s -> 343.49s]  Thank you all so much for watching. I really do appreciate it.
[343.49s -> 345.49s]  And I'll catch you guys all next time.
[345.49s -> 347.49s]  And of course, take care, everybody.
