[28.86s -> 45.61s]  What's up? How's it going? Oh shit. No, we're good. How's everybody doing? Good. How you been? It's been a little while.
[57.85s -> 68.31s]  We missed you. Hey, thank you. Hey, it goes both ways. I wanted to get back in the chair too.
[69.38s -> 76.44s]  How you doing? Everyone doing good? What's been going on? Anything new? Anything I should know?
[78.33s -> 82.95s]  I hope you're doing good. It's been a few weeks. Has it been three weeks or two and a half?
[83.43s -> 96.39s]  I don't know. Show us your face. Give me a second. It's been like a couple of weeks. Hold on.
[97.27s -> 108.60s]  Yeah, we're going to play Shadows of Doubt. I have something very important to talk about too.
[109.96s -> 118.33s]  I'm a little saddened to say this, but I don't think I'm going to be able to complete
[118.97s -> 125.96s]  Breath of the Wild before Tears of the Kingdom comes out. Sorry to all you Breath of the Wild
[125.96s -> 131.80s]  Andes. I don't think that's going to happen. The game comes out literally tomorrow. I don't think.
[131.80s -> 140.86s]  I promised. Wait, I promised. Did I? Did I actually promise to do this? Did I? Oh, fuck.
[144.89s -> 151.34s]  I did not promise I was going to beat this game. Did I? How deep of a promise was this?
[152.90s -> 159.54s]  I didn't say I was going to eat any articles of clothing, right? I didn't say I was going to eat
[159.54s -> 181.77s]  any articles of clothing. Or did I? You promised. Oh, does anybody have a clip? You owe me 10 bucks.
[183.22s -> 188.34s]  Yeah, I'm probably just going to have to play Breath of the Wild while everybody else is playing.
[188.34s -> 192.55s]  It's going to be so stupid. You know how many people are going to come to the stream
[192.55s -> 196.95s]  in the next few days and be like, dude, what are you doing? What's wrong with you?
[201.66s -> 209.27s]  We will forgive you if you eat an article of clothing. No, I think I'm all right.
[209.27s -> 219.85s]  Does anybody have a quote for me? I'm at the podium right now. Yeah, hold on a minute.
[219.85s -> 226.15s]  Hold on. All the reporters are taking pictures. Anybody have a quote for me saying I was going to
[226.15s -> 245.54s]  do that? I don't think anybody's got a quote. You did say. Well, someone will find it eventually.
[245.54s -> 253.51s]  But anyways, what if we just watch the Breath of the Wild story recap trailer and I hold a
[253.51s -> 260.87s]  controller in my hand while we watch it and I move like I'm dodging and stuff? Is that all right?
[261.59s -> 276.63s]  It's not the same. No. How long do I have till it's out? Is it out Friday, Saturday, Sunday?
[276.63s -> 283.02s]  When is it up? There's no way I'm going to beat this game. I'm just no way I'm going to beat it.
[283.02s -> 290.81s]  No, we're going to. Don't worry. I'm not concerned about it. Guys, the last I think I've played
[291.85s -> 300.57s]  maybe three triple A games at launch. All the rest I play at least six months later.
[301.21s -> 308.01s]  And I don't know. Maybe do I play Tears of the Kingdom? I maybe have to beat Breath of the Wild
[308.01s -> 323.22s]  first. I'm ranting right now trying to find a way out of this. We will finish it. How do I find a
[323.22s -> 329.86s]  way out of this? All right. Anyways, how you doing? Hope you're doing good. I did want to play shadows
[329.86s -> 335.94s]  of doubt because Taleks brought it up. Said it was great. He said it's right up your alley. I was
[335.94s -> 350.25s]  like, really? He's like, yeah. I said, OK, if you do play Tears of the Kingdom, I'm not going to be
[350.25s -> 355.66s]  around. I'm going to savor the game for myself. That's fine. That's completely understandable.
[355.66s -> 364.49s]  Makes complete sense to me. OK, so let me first of all, let me just prove that I'm alive.
[365.29s -> 376.20s]  Right. Let me just get this over with. Hi. Yes, I'm alive. I exist. Also been seeing a lot of
[376.20s -> 383.11s]  people talk. It's weird because seeing a lot of people talk about Pegasus King 2 and they're
[383.19s -> 391.46s]  acting like I didn't get an advanced copy of that game. Honestly, like really? Really? You don't
[391.46s -> 401.59s]  think that I already have a copy of that game? You don't think I've already played it? Kind of
[401.59s -> 418.07s]  annoying. I'm always one step ahead of you. Two steps forward. You're one step back. Two steps
[418.07s -> 435.32s]  forward. You're one step back. Nice beard. Oh, yeah. Why do you have film grain? This is there?
[441.38s -> 449.30s]  Oh, my God. This is actually huge. Hey, hey, I'm back, everybody. How's everybody doing?
[450.10s -> 455.46s]  Oh, yeah. Well, you know, I have a razor. You know, I haven't shaved and I haven't got it.
[455.46s -> 460.86s]  I haven't had a haircut either. I'm keeping it. I don't give a shit. I don't care. I'm just going
[460.86s -> 470.50s]  to grow. I'm going to grow till it's like this long. Fuck it. What do you think? Should I? Should
[470.50s -> 483.51s]  I let it go? Should I just let it go like all the way? I'm going to start playing with fire on stream.
[483.51s -> 491.02s]  All right, let's go. You've waited long enough. You've waited over two and a half weeks.
[491.02s -> 499.42s]  I'm here now. How's everybody doing? This game apparently is you solve. It's randomly generated
[499.42s -> 510.47s]  cases. Seems pretty cool. I'm going to have to pay a lot of attention though. All right. Now,
[510.47s -> 516.54s]  italics told me do the tutorial and pay attention. He said, don't do this. Do not play this game if
[516.54s -> 522.20s]  you're not ready to put real brain power into this. He's like, you have to pay attention.
[522.20s -> 527.58s]  You have to know where the tools are. You have to know what to say. And then I asked him to repeat
[527.58s -> 532.26s]  that three more times before I understood. I wasn't really paying attention to what he was saying.
[533.37s -> 538.74s]  So, I'm ready. I know exactly what I'm getting into. I'm going to pay attention. I'm going to...
[538.74s -> 546.17s]  I promise I'm going to pay attention. Here we go. I'm ready. Can you guys even hear the game?
[546.17s -> 558.36s]  Oh, shit. Sorry. You guys mind if I turn the fan on? Why am I asking you? All right. Should I select
[558.36s -> 579.62s]  the city? Generate city or select city? For tutorial purposes. What is this? Okay. North
[583.61s -> 588.04s]  part Sapporo. Mercy. Okay. How about this one? This one looks good.
[592.34s -> 596.82s]  Is this like, do you guys have my, like, this is seed or something? You guys can play along? Cool.
[597.54s -> 611.88s]  This is going to crash my computer. What's my player's name? Okay. What do I look like?
[611.88s -> 631.14s]  I don't know. What should I put the... All right. Normal probably, right? You look disgruntled.
[632.98s -> 636.50s]  Should I just have my, like, just have my brow down the whole time? Just like,
[641.64s -> 660.25s]  I look disgruntled. I think this... Wait. Gadget Lisenko. I think that's perfect.
[660.25s -> 676.12s]  We're good? Yo, that's my name. What the fuck? All right. Stop talking to me. I need to pay
[676.12s -> 680.68s]  attention. I'm serious. I need to, I have to pay attention. I need to pay attention. I need to pay
[680.68s -> 693.69s]  attention. I need to pay attention. Caveman Detective. Don't put ideas in my head.
[698.09s -> 712.78s]  Stop distracting me. You're doing it. I would need a pipe. A caveman outfit. Pay attention.
[712.78s -> 722.73s]  Pay attention to what? It's just generating the seed. You are literally Willem Dafoe in
[722.73s -> 752.23s]  the lighthouse. Damn. I feel like I'm installing windows right now. This is going to be crazy.
[755.00s -> 770.33s]  Simulating past events? Wait. Look out for graffiti that may give clues about illegal businesses.
[770.33s -> 775.08s]  I should have been reading all of this. I know that most of you that have played this before
[775.08s -> 779.88s]  probably just like, this is basic, like, press tab to look at your inventory or whatever. But
[779.88s -> 787.70s]  I probably need to know this. All right. Everybody be quiet. In Shadows of Delta,
[787.70s -> 793.42s]  tutorial will guide you through how to use mechanics, though connecting the dots throughout
[793.42s -> 798.20s]  the cases on your shoulders, detective. Help can be accessed at any time through your detective
[798.20s -> 816.46s]  handbook. The main menu with F1. Turn it on. It is the late 20th century. Hyper industrialization
[816.46s -> 828.22s]  has swept the planet. The old urban empire has crumbled, giving way to the United Atlantic States
[828.22s -> 837.14s]  and the first elected mega corporation president in history, Starch Cola. You have a wicked slow
[837.14s -> 850.07s]  computer? No, I don't. As sea levels rise, cities have become polluted islands. Workers dream of
[850.07s -> 862.95s]  escaping to the fields, an exclusive retirement district you will ever see. Rival corporations
[863.59s -> 871.10s]  have a power leased by the privatized Starch Cola enforcers. Okay, process it. Don't just read it.
[871.74s -> 881.45s]  Fuck, I'm doing it again. Some say justice now only exists in the shadows.
[882.79s -> 901.21s]  I'm trying to pay attention. Stop distracting me over here. That is a doubt. The dead of night,
[901.21s -> 923.26s]  52 a.m. Tuesday, January 3rd, your apartment. That's probably good, right? That's much better.
[923.26s -> 945.27s]  Turn it up. So cold. Turn on the bedside light. Oh, okay. What? How did I? Why would I read this
[945.27s -> 952.17s]  right now? I'm not ready for this. I'm not ready for this info. It's too loud. Hold on. It's way
[952.17s -> 971.00s]  too loud. I just can't get used to sleeping without what? He's just lying here. Get up. Oh,
[971.00s -> 984.31s]  turn on the light switch in the kitchen. Oh, there's like a little. This is a scary game.
[984.31s -> 999.13s]  It's locked. Jump. What's in there? What is this? Oh, this is a lot of reading this game. Hold on.
[999.69s -> 1012.14s]  This is a Tennessee agreement drawn up between the landlord, Emer Jackson and me. Okay, this is my
[1012.14s -> 1028.58s]  landlord. This is my apartment. Okay. Shit. All right. Hold on. Everybody relax. This Tennessee
[1028.58s -> 1035.02s]  agreement is subject to the regulations of the Joint Corporation Housing Consortium. A copy of
[1035.02s -> 1041.32s]  these regulations may be obtained in writing from the nearest JCHC Administration Bureau on receipt

[1066.87s -> 1074.25s]  by the tenant. Okay. The tenant shall not repair or replace any windows, locks, lamps, sockets,
[1074.25s -> 1078.57s]  sprockets, outlets, inlets, pipes, faucets, vents, grills, bras, and appliances without
[1078.57s -> 1087.94s]  express permission to the landlord. Do I have any weapons? What's up? Where's somebody talking?
[1088.50s -> 1099.78s]  Oh, I thought someone was trying to get in. Let me continue reading this.
[1100.58s -> 1109.35s]  I got more info. Hold on. The tenant shall keep in good repair all walls, tiles, and flooring.
[1109.91s -> 1115.35s]  The tenant shall not paint, plaster, paper, or alter walls, tiles, or flooring in any way.

[1127.00s -> 1136.66s]  All right. It's a rental agreement of some kind. So don't break anything and make sure
[1136.66s -> 1142.70s]  you register with the landlord and building supervisor. I've just signed it. Okay. I guess.
[1142.70s -> 1161.53s]  Did I? Oh, all right. Let's go. Why do I need to know all this? What's that? What's this? Okay.
[1161.53s -> 1179.96s]  It's January. Oh, I can change the date by moving it. Oh, city directory. Yeah. That's a lot of
[1179.96s -> 1185.59s]  people. Let me just do what it's tell. I just stop overwhelming myself and just turn the light on.
[1185.59s -> 1192.68s]  That's it. Don't. Why am I doing? Why am I making this more complicated? When within range,
[1192.68s -> 1203.21s]  possible interactions will be displayed at the bottom. Oh, hello.
[1210.49s -> 1239.54s]  Who's this? Ow. Why did somebody call me and hang up? What was that? All right. Search for clues.
[1240.10s -> 1248.31s]  Former police officer's welfare association. We're here for you. Free basic housing for those in
[1248.31s -> 1255.70s]  need. For more information, contact Henry. Please note, we can no longer help with money. Wait,

[1279.62s -> 1297.03s]  why you would sprint across your house like that. Okay. Wait, shut up for a second. What's,

[1328.86s -> 1342.71s]  I, this is their apartment. A lot of routes. Just go hang out. I just planned a route. Wait,
[1342.71s -> 1352.25s]  I can pin this. Whoa. Okay. So, all right. There's a note under the front door. That's not a front
[1352.25s -> 1364.78s]  door. Where's my front door? This is also not my front door. This is my front door. What is this?
[1364.78s -> 1368.78s]  When you inspect an item, it brings up its evidence window. This can be pinned to your
[1368.78s -> 1383.51s]  case board for future reference using the pin at the top. Okay. So I can pin info. Got it. Thank
[1383.51s -> 1389.93s]  God I got a beard for today's stream. Pinned items are displayed as icons that you can move
[1389.93s -> 1393.37s]  around on the board by dragging their pin. You can position these items as you wish.
[1393.93s -> 1401.24s]  Let them to bring up their evidence. You can make connections. Facts or connections are displayed
[1401.24s -> 1407.61s]  as string. You can mouse over these to see more info and use F to pause at any time to examine
[1407.61s -> 1423.45s]  the case board. Find Killian Dewitt. Pin Killian Dewitt to your case board. Pin the note to your
[1423.45s -> 1436.47s]  case board. Oh, shit. I fucked it all up. What happened? Close the case. Wait, what is this?
[1440.18s -> 1450.26s]  This is the case board, right? Isn't it pinned right now? These are all pinned. All right. Move
[1450.26s -> 1455.72s]  this out of the way. This is not, I need to find this person. Let me go look them up in the directory.
[1455.72s -> 1469.00s]  Never heard of them. If this is a job, it's a lousy way to do business. Yep. Okay. Look them up in the
[1469.08s -> 1489.08s]  directory. Okay. Pin to your case board. Whatever it is, I better go prepared. Find old detective
[1489.08s -> 1497.83s]  equipment. Oh, wait. Okay. That's map. You also have access to city district map that you can
[1497.83s -> 1504.54s]  toggle it up a little. Whatever. I missed it. What's the case board again? F? All right. I'm
[1504.54s -> 1517.02s]  starting. I'm getting it. I'm getting it. This is where I need to go. Find a route. We're heading
[1517.02s -> 1532.62s]  that way. Screwdriver. I'll take it. Exit inventory. Okay. I take snacks. It's still good.
[1534.22s -> 1546.22s]  Are they still good? I don't know. Why? Why did they let me throw that? Dish detergent. Okay. I
[1546.22s -> 1555.02s]  could use that. Give me some tissues. What's in the fridge? There's milk and there's a block of
[1555.02s -> 1561.90s]  chicken. What about the freezer? That's all I need is a detective apparently, right? Wait.
[1561.90s -> 1574.63s]  Find all detective equipment. Synthetic milk. Synth milk. Oh, a wrench. Inventory's full.
[1574.63s -> 1591.26s]  What? How do I get to my inventory? I? How about open inventory again? X. Okay. Okay. Well, I don't
[1591.26s -> 1601.00s]  need this. So get rid of this. I, I gotta turn that down. It's awful. All right. I'm taking the
[1601.00s -> 1614.73s]  screwdriver, the milk, the chicken. Do I need anything else? The key to my old police stuff
[1614.73s -> 1619.37s]  was lost in the last move. I could pick the lock. There's got to be something I could use around
[1619.37s -> 1634.38s]  here. Look for hairpins or paper clips. What about the, I can use the wrench? I don't think I can.
[1634.38s -> 1645.93s]  It's money. Money can be used to buy items in the world. Acquire genetic upgrades for your character.
[1645.93s -> 1651.38s]  Pay for information. Decorate your apartment. Really? This is, oh, wait a minute. What's this?
[1651.38s -> 1664.23s]  Final notice open immediately. How do I open it? Final notice open immediately. So open it.
[1664.23s -> 1692.55s]  This is a letter from me. Okay. I need to find, hold on. Let me do the tutorial. What? Oh, I got
[1692.55s -> 1716.30s]  Luigi. It took too long. Okay. Pick the lock. I need two of these. Why would I need two? Oh, wait.
[1716.30s -> 1738.25s]  7%. Did I open it? What happened? What did I just do? I need two. Oh, okay. What's that? Clean air
[1738.25s -> 1743.05s]  sunshine with every place and external space. Zone living areas for each family. Some opportunity
[1743.05s -> 1747.70s]  for individual expression. Fields for the happiest and best homes. Register your initial interest
[1747.70s -> 1769.77s]  today. Okay. Okay. Locked? Dude, this is my door. How am I locked in my own house? Hey, gadget.
[1770.49s -> 1780.28s]  I set the password back to 1234. Take care of yourself. This is my house. Password is 1234.
[1781.08s -> 1807.93s]  Toothpaste. Toothbrush. God damn it. I need more room. Let me fix this right now. That's better.
[1807.93s -> 1820.12s]  Oh, a paper clip. Each lock has its own strength. When you start the, this game is actually pretty
[1820.12s -> 1826.14s]  cool. I'm very interested. When you start the process by interacting with the door handle or
[1826.14s -> 1830.86s]  lock, the indicated bars will tell you how many picks you need to complete the lock pick. Okay.
[1830.86s -> 1840.63s]  So I need, would need three. You can also use lock picks to sabotage security systems. Okay.
[1840.63s -> 1862.79s]  This is a very weird toilet. I should probably drop these, right? I'm just checking and just
[1862.79s -> 1884.71s]  making sure I don't miss anything. Okay. Let's go. Don't jump. Okay. Got it. Ooh. Okay. Yep.
[1885.27s -> 1893.99s]  The top group. Wait, I got to pay attention. Let me just take a step. The top group of items do not
[1893.99s -> 1901.10s]  take up inventory space. These are for your vital tools of the trade. The lower section features
[1901.10s -> 1908.41s]  slots. They can store other world items. So, okay. It's, I got it. Drop or scan picked up items for
[1908.41s -> 1917.32s]  fingerprints. Ooh, that's cool. Assign hotkeys. Press the hotkey by hovering and pressing. You
[1917.32s -> 1933.83s]  guys just, just pay attention to this so I can ask you later. Okay. I got 30 lock picks. That was
[1933.83s -> 1943.86s]  what was in that box. Okay. I got the key to my house. The password was pinned. Select the pin.
[1943.86s -> 1952.09s]  Yep. And then I already got it planned. Unlock the door to your apartment by interacting with
[1952.09s -> 1970.68s]  the door. That's, that's the closet. Hello everybody. It's me, the detective. Here to
[1970.68s -> 1982.15s]  hopefully solve another couple of cases. You be on your best behavior. Oh, I wasn't locked in my
[1982.15s -> 1998.78s]  room for 45 minutes. All right. I have to go. I can talk to. Unknown citizen, new information.
[1998.78s -> 2004.07s]  Evening. What's your name? Have you seen or heard anything unusual? Do you know this person?
[2004.07s -> 2010.63s]  Could you provide your fingerprints for an investor? Do you know this person?
[2010.63s -> 2019.64s]  I can't help you. Evening. What's your name? I'm Jarek Lean. What's it up to you?
[2019.64s -> 2037.37s]  You got any spare change? That guy just gave me money. Thank you. That guy gave me two bucks.
[2037.37s -> 2055.59s]  Uh, what's, what's that person? How do I, this person on the board. Oh, there it is. Okay.
[2055.59s -> 2071.18s]  How do I write like a note? Very, was very nice to me. Additional notes.
[2071.18s -> 2077.46s]  It was incredibly nice and gave me two dollars. Uh, I don't think we need to remember this person,
[2077.46s -> 2102.20s]  but whatever. Is sprinting bad? This is locked. Somebody's coming to answer the door. Banker,
[2102.20s -> 2119.96s]  bar and grill? Is this a restaurant? Evening. How much for a tour of this place? Sure. I can
[2119.96s -> 2133.59s]  issue a temporary guest pass, but it'll cost you. How much? How much money do I have? Do you know
[2133.59s -> 2140.84s]  this person? I saw them today at Thompson House ground floor lobby around 2 15 a.m. Isn't that
[2140.84s -> 2168.15s]  how it is right now? What's your name? I'm CEO young. He, what's it to you? What? Let's go.
[2172.92s -> 2186.14s]  Can I get in trouble? What is this place? It's a hospital. Am I allowed to be in here? I guess
[2186.14s -> 2197.67s]  it's just a hospital, right? Leave with the fire extinguisher. Yeah. Official police business. I
[2197.67s -> 2208.98s]  need to take this with me. Uh, how do I, what do we do with this though? Depending on your activity,
[2208.98s -> 2213.18s]  different kinds of status may affect your character. Oh, wait, something's wrong. What does
[2213.18s -> 2229.80s]  that mean? What's that mean? Wet. Oh, I thought that meant I was in trouble. Why are you running?
[2232.86s -> 2245.00s]  I'm just like a fucking weirdo. All right. Let me go to 901 Royal Heights. Okay.
[2252.47s -> 2270.23s]  They ain't coming back this time. Wait, is this a trash can or is that an ATM? You know, I'm going
[2270.23s -> 2300.86s]  to have to take the plunger, right? Bists. I don't think we're ever going to get any. We're not
[2300.86s -> 2304.58s]  going to get anything done. I just want to make that really clear. I'm sorry, everybody. I don't
[2304.58s -> 2312.52s]  think we're going to solve one case. I got to, how do I put these down? Okay. I have to pay.
[2312.52s -> 2321.42s]  This is the tutorial. I can't fuck around. What's that? It's a battery. God, just draw. I need to
[2321.42s -> 2335.80s]  just go, just go up the stairs, please, man. Jim Stetter is a popular brand of beer brewed by the
[2335.80s -> 2369.48s]  starch cola corporation to prove drink responsibly. 12, uh, junk footprint. These are footprints
[2369.48s -> 2394.28s]  right here. How do I scan it? This is a different foot, size eight and a size six. What I've deduced
[2394.28s -> 2399.08s]  is that they have two different size feet. I don't know. I'm not sure what we're dealing with
[2399.08s -> 2434.52s]  here. What's up? Evening. What's your name? As if I tell you, okay. Um, I'll give you money for your
[2434.52s -> 2441.91s]  name. Do you know this person? It's not enough info for me to help you. I think it's your neighbor.
[2441.91s -> 2474.41s]  Okay. Well, goodbye. Oh my, nevermind. I didn't know that could happen. Am I alive? Where even am I?
[2474.49s -> 2491.38s]  I have a broken leg. I didn't know you could actually do that. I'm so fucked up right now.
[2491.38s -> 2495.38s]  I did not know. I thought there was an invisible barrier that didn't let me walk through it.
[2498.54s -> 2523.77s]  We're only on the sixth floor. Where's the elevator? We need to go to floor number nine.
[2523.77s -> 2545.16s]  I swear I didn't do that on purpose. It's so funny. You know, if a door is locked or not,
[2545.16s -> 2551.29s]  you must first have to try and open it. Lock doors can be unlocked by focusing on the door handle.
[2551.29s -> 2556.15s]  You have the correct key for the door. You'll see an interaction open. Okay. So this is locked.
[2556.55s -> 2573.29s]  Doors locked. When breaking into a room, it's a good idea to check for cameras.
[2573.29s -> 2576.33s]  If you're worried about them, you can turn them up by using the security breaker box
[2576.33s -> 2618.26s]  connected to the camera. This person. Hold on. We need to listen. Hold on. Are they just,
[2618.26s -> 2638.76s]  are they just watching Nick at night? There's nobody in here. All right. Where's the camera?
[2638.76s -> 2644.15s]  Oh my God. What'd I just do? I thought that, I thought, how do I restart the game?
[2644.15s -> 2650.82s]  How do I restart the game? I don't want to sabotage this. That's an alarm. What is that?
[2650.82s -> 2667.30s]  I honestly, I, where's the breaker? This is like the alarm. I owe a hundred bucks to who?
[2669.27s -> 2720.39s]  What was? Oh shit. Okay. Leave with air ducts. Hide under beds. How do I turn this off?
[2720.39s -> 2752.57s]  This is a good show. Antique vase. Bunch of shit. Hammer in here.
[2762.58s -> 2774.70s]  What? I'm drinking the whole carton. I'm going to puke. Put it down. Put it down. Put it down.
[2775.58s -> 2785.61s]  I'm just fucking this guy's whole apartment up. I drank, I drank soy milk in this person's
[2785.61s -> 2795.78s]  apartment until I puked. There's still more. Okay. I need to fucking settle down. Honest to
[2795.78s -> 2830.01s]  goodness. You got cameras in here? Oh shit. My God. Unknown citizen, new information. Dead.
[2830.01s -> 2839.06s]  Dead. A bullet wound from low caliber aim. An eight millimeter nine by 32. Wait, pin that.
[2839.62s -> 2845.35s]  I'm examining the body. It appears that the victim has been shot to death with a pistol
[2845.35s -> 2854.73s]  or revolver. I can determine the time of death is between 2345 and one Tuesday, January 3rd.
[2854.73s -> 2885.50s]  Pin this. Tall. Unknown citizen. Find a photo ID. I need a light. How do I turn the lights on?
[2892.26s -> 2901.54s]  Oh, internet works. Killian DeWitt. Wait, this is Killian DeWitt on the ground.
[2901.54s -> 2923.29s]  Connect. Okay. Put that right here. Got it. Okay. This is Killian DeWitt. Killian DeWitt is dead.
[2923.29s -> 2936.86s]  A sword. How do I pick up this? How do I use the sword? What's that? What does that mean? What was
[2936.86s -> 2950.52s]  that? What was that? Look around for a potential quick exit. Shit. I gotta pay attention. Vintage
[2950.52s -> 2972.55s]  sword. I don't, I don't know whose sword this is. I'm going to owe a thousand dollars. This is so,
[2972.55s -> 2985.54s]  this game's awesome. I'm like playing with all this guy's toys. Thank you for recently
[2986.50s -> 2991.64s]  life insurance policy. Do not meet the required social economic requirements to be approved.
[2991.64s -> 3000.65s]  Check out a range of alternatives. Okay. There was, there was a insurance policy taken out.
[3000.65s -> 3031.56s]  How do I close this menu? Oh, right here. You can travel through buildings via ventilation ducts.
[3031.56s -> 3049.05s]  Simply open the grate. Okay. So did I, this is not what it wants me to do. Look around for vents.
[3049.05s -> 3061.48s]  I just found it, right? It's still on my menu. I still have a broken leg. Is it the bathroom?
[3061.48s -> 3102.46s]  Just go in it. Okay. Well, I got info. Is it safe to go down here?
[3102.46s -> 3111.46s]  That's killing it. All right. Just search the place for clues. Well, why, why did I go through
[3111.46s -> 3122.02s]  the vent? Okay. Hold on. Each citizen has a unique fingerprint. You can scan for them using the
[3122.02s -> 3127.35s]  fingerprint scanner device in your inventory. Point the scanner where you want to scan. Almost
[3127.35s -> 3133.90s]  all surfaces can contain fingerprints. Unknown fingerprints will be found in sets with set A
[3133.90s -> 3141.06s]  being the first you find any matching prints will also be labeled to that corresponding set.
[3141.06s -> 3146.58s]  For example, if you find set A at an apartment and subsequently at a bar, you can prove a citizen
[3146.58s -> 3152.07s]  was in both locations at some point. Use right mouse button to inspect fingerprints after you
[3152.07s -> 3159.38s]  found them to pin them to your case board. They may disappear over time. Interesting.
[3159.38s -> 3190.18s]  Somebody here? Look at the prints. Turn the lights off. Print writer, prints right there,
[3190.18s -> 3197.86s]  right there. Look at that. This is Killian DeWitt's fingerprint. All right. Pin that
[3197.86s -> 3214.04s]  shit writer. Anything else? We're looking for other fingerprints. We don't know who this is.
[3214.04s -> 3223.61s]  Okay. This is type B. We don't know who it belongs to. And that over here. Very, very cool.
[3223.61s -> 3231.06s]  Okay. These prints don't belong to Killian and nobody else lives here. That's the killer,
[3231.06s -> 3257.45s]  obviously. Isn't it obvious? How do I turn this TV off? Drugs? No, it's an eraser. Is it an eraser?
[3257.45s -> 3288.12s]  Just hit it with the sword. Coin? No, how do I hit this? Shut this TV off. I can't turn the TV off.
[3288.12s -> 3323.10s]  Pour milk on it. 541-000. Last caller was telephone call. Pin that shit. 404-2676.
[3323.10s -> 3365.72s]  We got it. I was like, oh, Gregory, huh? Shut this fucking TV off. Evening, what's your name?
[3365.72s -> 3389.16s]  As if I'd tell. Have you seen or heard anything unusual? Shit. Please, no. Please, he begged us
[3389.16s -> 3394.73s]  and I flashed a light of the puncher. Please, you can have the promotion. I found the office chair
[3394.73s -> 3399.69s]  I tied him to. Uh-huh. I said, it is too late. You shouldn't have given the position to Jill.
[3399.69s -> 3405.18s]  Now you will pay. I shrieked, but I took a printout of last quarter's fiscal report.
[3405.18s -> 3424.46s]  Stuffed it in his mouth. Who's underperforming now? Did he write this? Save, save, save. What?
[3424.46s -> 3455.74s]  What do you mean save? Oh my god. Yes. Italic said, for the record, I told him to ignore all
[3455.74s -> 3460.63s]  the little detail things and just go punch people in the face. Chat, your job is to remind him to
[3460.63s -> 3466.31s]  save because I don't think there's an auto-save. Yeah, but I wanted to like, I wanted to understand
[3466.31s -> 3476.98s]  what I was doing, Italic. All right, what is this? I mean, it's connected to somebody.
[3476.98s -> 3493.54s]  Should I call all these phone numbers? Oh, this is a lot of people. Okay. Who is this? Get this
[3493.54s -> 3504.20s]  person off my bar and get this off my bar too. What's the point of this? Get rid of this. Yeah,
[3504.20s -> 3515.69s]  I already did. Get rid of this. I need to clean this up, by the way. Fingerprint right here,
[3516.25s -> 3541.56s]  put the address here. All right. Why is this so weird? I still have a broken leg. Search for
[3541.56s -> 3550.31s]  clues at the crime scene. All right, we got some clues. What's that? What's in there? What's this?
[3554.86s -> 3567.26s]  Oh, safe. Locked. Keypad. We need a four-digit key. Do I have any? What do you got here?
[3568.78s -> 3580.58s]  Doctor's prescription. Okay, this is the doctor that prescribed this. High blood pressure. All
[3580.58s -> 3593.34s]  right. You. We're calling you. Wait, I want to pin that. Here's the connection. Prescription
[3593.34s -> 3597.40s]  from this doctor. We're going to call this doctor. You sound like a tuber right now.
[3598.79s -> 3614.25s]  I'll settle down. I'll settle down. New policy, dear. Okay, do it. Thank you for recently contacting
[3614.25s -> 3624.38s]  us to request a life insurance. Oh, I already did this one. Pin it anyways. Okay. Sometimes
[3624.38s -> 3631.62s]  it's useful to search the trash. This is crumpled up. Receipt key for tax records. Banker, bar,
[3631.62s -> 3647.45s]  and grill. Call me. Not paid. Wait. I knocked on this door. So I have a tab. Well, I don't have a
[3647.45s -> 3671.11s]  tab. Killian Dewitt has a tab. Can that make that connection? Tape. A little used device containing
[3671.11s -> 3699.05s]  magnetic tape to store moving images and sounding. Okay. Okay. So code breaker. Bug on the floor?
[3699.05s -> 3710.87s]  What's wrong with me? What's wrong? What's wrong with my character? What's wrong with me? I have
[3710.87s -> 3737.19s]  a code breaker now. What am I doing? Watch this. Uh oh. Why am I shaking? Commemorative baseball?
[3737.19s -> 3751.96s]  Take this vial to a local sync clinic to upgrade one of your installed sync disks. And then what's
[3751.96s -> 3767.32s]  this? The menace of charity. What is wrong with me? Honestly, what's going on? That's a lot of
[3767.32s -> 3793.82s]  money. That's a $10,000 fine. I don't have that money. So can I sleep? Can I sleep this off? Oh,
[3793.82s -> 3808.60s]  what the hell? Don't forget who owns you. Okay. A bandage. Oh, hold on. I need that. I don't need
[3808.60s -> 3832.47s]  this. I need this though. Use it right now on my leg. Can I just eat the bandage? Remember your pass
[3832.47s -> 3849.59s]  code this time? Oh, God damn it. I just wasted that code breaker. Okay. I need to go to the hospital
[3850.92s -> 3871.74s]  now. This is kind of giving me a headache. I'm puking into the trash. I just puked in it.
[3872.38s -> 3881.93s]  Let me get my hands in there now. Key for tax records. Okay. Coffee. Hamburger. I went to the
[3881.93s -> 3890.73s]  turkey sandwich bar. Apparently this guy's eating food. Very cool. Okay. This is just a receipt.
[3890.81s -> 3906.18s]  The silent alarm has been tripped. It means what? Oh, how do I get under the bed? The dot in the
[3906.18s -> 3911.22s]  middle of the screen displays how hidden you are. A hollow circle means you are completely obscured
[3911.22s -> 3915.03s]  and others will only notice you if you get extremely close. Filled in circle means you're
[3915.03s -> 3924.50s]  completely visible. Okay. So that means something can see you. When things go wrong, you might have
[3924.50s -> 3933.38s]  to resort to combat. Punch or block, but be careful detective. Violence can escalate quickly.
[3933.38s -> 3940.25s]  How do I get under the bed? How do I get under the bed? It told me to, I said I could get under the
[3940.25s -> 3990.58s]  bed. Is a vent in this room? Oh, fuck. I, where'd I go? That was, that was weird, right? It looked
[3990.58s -> 4019.51s]  like I fell through the world. Where am I? Am I even inside of this thing? I think they're gone.
[4019.51s -> 4060.71s]  I think they're gone. Just walked out the fucking front door. All right, we're good. How do I get
[4060.71s -> 4095.21s]  out of here? Out the window? Oh shit. You can do that? I'm dead. I, what happened? What? I didn't,
[4095.21s -> 4105.93s]  what just happened? What? Am I alive? What? Am I, am I down here now? What just happened?
[4105.93s -> 4110.98s]  Oh, I clipped through the door. Oh, okay. Well, I'm just kind of bleeding out.
[4110.98s -> 4117.22s]  I gotta get to the hospital right now. I stink too, apparently. I smells. I have so, all right.
[4117.22s -> 4123.19s]  This is like in The Sims when you have like three or four different families and you just, or like
[4123.19s -> 4127.35s]  there's like five people in the household and just one of them you've just neglected for like an hour
[4127.35s -> 4136.58s]  and you don't even realize it. I am fucked up right now. Bleeding, stinky, broken leg. Okay.
[4136.58s -> 4152.82s]  Let's just go get out of here. Why am I walking by the way?
[4162.60s -> 4190.46s]  Oh my God. There's so much blood. There is so much blood. How do I get rid of this trail?
[4190.46s -> 4203.91s]  Collect a murder case resolution form from city hall. I need to, uh, I'm in, I'm hurt. I need to,
[4203.91s -> 4217.74s]  where's the doctor? I need a doctor. What's this? A cola. Is there anything left in it? Come on,
[4217.74s -> 4246.25s]  let me have a couple of little scraps. Where's the hospital? Am I picking this shit up? I'm just,
[4246.97s -> 4270.39s]  what am I doing? Where's the hospital? I'm sorry. I can't play this game. Where's the hospital? How
[4270.39s -> 4284.92s]  do I control the map? Cause like, I can't move it from here. Wait. Okay. Over here. Here's the clinic.
[4284.92s -> 4291.61s]  Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I need quite a few things. I need you. I need a,
[4291.61s -> 4305.54s]  I need a splint for my leg. I need a, um, money in front of me. Hello. Hi. Um, I'd like to buy
[4305.54s -> 4346.68s]  something. I'd like a splint please. Thank you. Okay. Uh, what about all the blood? I want to take
[4346.68s -> 4379.43s]  it so bad. Bandage. I don't have any. Hold on. I'm bleeding everywhere. What handcuffs, sink, disc,
[4379.43s -> 4394.22s]  upgrade vial. Get rid of the baseball. I'm, hold on. Wait, can I get in the, wait, can I, can you,
[4394.22s -> 4430.07s]  I need treatment. Installing a disc. I don't have anything to do. I don't have anything to upgrade.
[4430.07s -> 4456.14s]  Okay. I am good to go now. I get this. Potential crime. All employees, the door code to my office
[4456.14s -> 4508.46s]  has been reset to 1608. Save, save, save. All right. All right. I got it. I got it. Perfect
[4508.46s -> 4519.72s]  lightning strike. What did I pick up? I picked up something else. Wait, whose blood is this?
[4519.72s -> 4547.19s]  What did I pick up? Okay. Collect a murder case resolution form. Where do I get it? City hall.
[4547.19s -> 4555.08s]  Oh, right here. Okay. Collected form. Got a resolution form. View your case objective
[4555.08s -> 4562.98s]  by using the resolve button in the top right of the case board screen. Resolve the case.
[4562.98s -> 4568.30s]  Provide answers for the following before plotting a route to the hand in destination. What is the
[4568.30s -> 4573.64s]  full name of the killer? Do you have any evidence to place the killer at the crime scene? Okay. Wait,
[4573.64s -> 4588.60s]  wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. I got it. I got it. I got it. Juniper networks and the doctor too.
[4588.60s -> 4597.37s]  Check out the sandwich bar. I have a, I got it on the board. We don't need to do this yet.
[4597.37s -> 4605.85s]  I am going to go, go to the work. Okay. Juniper networks. Let's plan a route and we're going to
[4605.85s -> 4614.82s]  scan for fingerprints. We're looking for that one. Game is sick. It's really fun. In shadows of
[4614.82s -> 4618.58s]  doubt, there are almost always multiple ways to carry out an investigation. Here are the current
[4618.58s -> 4622.58s]  available leads. Choose one as a star to be guided through. Remember in the main game, you'll have
[4622.58s -> 4627.56s]  to think for yourself, detective. In addition, due to the simulated nature of the game, some leads
[4627.56s -> 4631.72s]  could be dead ends. It's just part of the job. If you think you have enough information to solve
[4631.72s -> 4641.19s]  the case, fill in the resolution form. Okay. Investigate the office, diner, or phone calls.
[4641.19s -> 4652.20s]  Should I just disable this or no? I think I'm going to do the diner. Okay. So we'll go into the
[4652.20s -> 4685.53s]  turkey sandwich place. Let's go find this out. Am I still bleeding? Didn't I just steal from you?
[4685.53s -> 4692.94s]  Oops. Bro, you stink. Take a shower. I tried to take a shower earlier. It wouldn't let me.
[4692.94s -> 4733.06s]  The camera's too big. All right. Let's go check this out. What's going on? Commercial properties
[4733.06s -> 4743.54s]  contain a wealth of information and probably usually I, huh. Okay. All right. So I'm going
[4743.54s -> 4774.12s]  to take the kettle off the stove, please. Fingerprint type C. What about this one? Doesn't match.
[4776.50s -> 4814.58s]  Type D. Check the booth. Type E. Type F. We're looking for B. Wait, I can eat? I should do that
[4814.58s -> 4839.05s]  right now. How do I sit down? Okay. Only his fingerprints were on this. So this thing is
[4839.05s -> 4853.91s]  useless to me. Can I sell it to somebody? Is he still the tutorial? Yeah. This tutorial is a long
[4853.91s -> 4859.50s]  tutorial. It's designed to make it so you, it's, I'm learning the game. We'll do another one.
[4859.50s -> 4869.90s]  Let's talk. Let's figure this out. What's your name? Mind your own business. Okay. Have you
[4869.90s -> 4879.05s]  seen anything unusual? No. Do you know this person? I saw them somewhere around Royal Heights. Okay.
[4879.05s -> 4890.81s]  Checks out. Checks out. Did you provide your fingerprints for an investigation?
[4890.81s -> 4922.68s]  Didn't even do anything. I just put two bucks in here. Ooh, fingerprints. Let's go for it.
[4922.68s -> 5003.48s]  This place is filthy. Am I just, oh, sentry gun. It's okay. We're good. Okay. I gotta hurry up.
[5003.48s -> 5048.76s]  Why would there be a sentry gun leading over here? How do I turn this off? M. Toilet paper. What's
[5048.76s -> 5103.50s]  this? What is that? We're going to the bathroom. I gotta check this thing for fingerprints. Oh,
[5103.50s -> 5119.27s]  we need B. Oh my God. Why did I think this was an office? I just, I'm sneaking into the public
[5119.27s -> 5125.13s]  bathrooms. I'm sneaking into the public bathrooms. Like, oh, I gotta find my way over here. Disable
[5125.13s -> 5130.01s]  the security cam. Oh, the alarm system. This is literally just the public bathroom of this
[5130.01s -> 5140.09s]  restaurant. This is just the bathroom. This is the bathrooms. There's nothing even back here.
[5140.73s -> 5157.94s]  Why did I disable all these things? I thought this is somebody's office. Oh, shit. I'm sorry.
[5157.94s -> 5185.11s]  Wait, nobody in there. Okay. We're good. Come on. I'm in here. Dude, he, and we're behind the
[5185.11s -> 5201.46s]  counter. Perfect. Okay. So let's go ahead and what's that? The note. I was in the stall. All
[5201.46s -> 5211.64s]  right. So I got, will you talk to me? Health inspector. I need to survey your premises.
[5211.64s -> 5223.69s]  Health inspector, huh? Still going to need a guest pass to take a look around. Okay. All right. I'm
[5223.69s -> 5230.14s]  paying it. Your guest pass is active for two hours. After that, you'll need to leave or pay someone
[5230.14s -> 5243.30s]  for more time. There it is. The door code to my office. Seven two nine zero. Let's go ahead.
[5243.30s -> 5262.02s]  Okay. Got it. Seven two nine zero. Hurry up. I don't have much time. Oops. Fingerprints. Quick.
[5277.30s -> 5302.30s]  Club sign up below. No, none of you. Wait, who are these people? Waitstaff. Waitstaff. Okay.
[5302.30s -> 5317.82s]  Just get, I'm getting names down here. Did I pin any of these? Urban? No. No. Janitor. Waitstaff.
[5317.90s -> 5327.91s]  Waitstaff. Retail owner. Waitstaff. And waitstaff. All right. I just learned a bunch of people's names.
[5328.55s -> 5343.02s]  Can't get in here. Seven two nine zero. How do I get in here without them being pissed that I'm
[5343.02s -> 5355.24s]  doing this though? Can I go in here? Is everyone getting mad at me? Can I do this? Just in case.
[5355.24s -> 5359.88s]  I know I'm allowed to be back here to be the health inspector, but it seems like off limits to me.
[5363.64s -> 5374.42s]  Seven two nine zero. Hunters are digital personal computation devices. They're common in most
[5374.42s -> 5379.22s]  apartments and white collar workplaces. If you know a citizen's passcode you can log into their
[5379.22s -> 5385.90s]  account. Really? Once logged in you'll be able to access vmails which are personal or work related
[5385.90s -> 5390.30s]  sent between citizens. You also build access a variety of other apps including security and
[5390.30s -> 5395.42s]  surveillance as well as employee databases. If you find useful evidence on a micro cruncher,
[5395.42s -> 5404.14s]  don't forget to print it using the on-screen print button. Okay. I don't have very much time so let's
[5404.14s -> 5436.60s]  go. First things first. Open the breaker box. Ah somebody was just in here. Camera. Yeah the
[5436.60s -> 5441.26s]  tutorial said hey open the breaker box. I was just doing what it told me. I don't know it's weird.
[5441.26s -> 5502.18s]  Somebody was in here. Did I do it? All right I need this info. CCTV cameras have two functions
[5502.18s -> 5507.32s]  to alert instance of security threat but actually capture surveillance still throughout the day.
[5507.32s -> 5519.26s]  Ooh okay. So I'm looking for somebody that was in here with this with this dude right? How can
[5519.26s -> 5559.66s]  me look like you just got back from Survivor? Okay 22 45 Monday. 22 40 22 45 Monday. How do I
[5559.66s -> 5588.01s]  change the time? Okay hold on. How do I do time? Oh 22 sitting with somebody. Open an evidence
[5588.01s -> 5616.44s]  window by inspecting their mugshot. No! Shit! Okay you were there and so were you. All right.
[5616.44s -> 5646.89s]  Interesting. What were you doing there? Interesting. Where are you? Lawrence Champion. Janitor. I gotta
[5646.89s -> 5660.78s]  talk to the janitor. Open an evidence window by inspecting the mugshot. Didn't I just do that? I
[5660.78s -> 5690.86s]  didn't just do that. I need to click on. Oh this guy just doesn't care that I'm in here. No I gotta
[5690.86s -> 5696.52s]  I gotta track down this person here because you have the guest pass. I was freaking out for no
[5696.52s -> 5709.90s]  reason. All right so I need to figure out who that person is. So I think I'm all right now.
[5709.90s -> 5726.50s]  So it was the janitor. Janitor. There it is. Okay there you are. Janitor. Are you here now?
[5726.50s -> 5742.09s]  Where's the janitor? Uh do you know this person? I work with them. That's Lawrence Champion.
[5742.09s -> 5753.58s]  Loves coffee. Saw them today at McCarthy Street around 7 a.m. To a nearby Butler Street at itself.
[5756.71s -> 5767.03s]  Okay thank you. Butler Street? So down that way. You didn't do the PC thing correctly?
[5767.67s -> 5784.89s]  What did I do wrong? Surveillance. Go to the right time on Monday. Oh I have to print it. Right right
[5784.89s -> 5815.06s]  right. Wait a minute. Print this. Got it. There it is. There it is. Use a different camera. Who's that?
[5815.06s -> 5855.26s]  What are you doing over here? Print that. And that too. Who's that? I got it. Are you pissed that I
[5855.26s -> 5867.14s]  tried to pick up your burnt cigarette? I think I'm good. You missed the girl. Well somebody was a
[5867.14s -> 5879.59s]  just a wait staff. It wasn't. Yeah this this is the wait staff right? I don't think this person is
[5879.59s -> 5889.85s]  a person of interest. No I got what I need. Oh I just want to go back. I don't want. Come on.
[5889.85s -> 5905.18s]  Store room. I got that one. Back room. Nothing. No no I got it. I got it right here. So where do
[5905.18s -> 5914.79s]  you go? You're still kind of hanging out in here. Don't just. All right you just take that photo. I
[5914.79s -> 5949.45s]  don't even care. No the other camera. The only footage of the. Wait who's this? Unknown. Print
[5949.45s -> 5971.61s]  that shit out. Did it run out of paper? Oh interesting. Pin that. Okay you. I need to
[5971.61s -> 5985.24s]  find out who you are. It's a paper jam. Dude you are so smart. It's a complicated game and it's fun.
[5985.24s -> 5996.07s]  Okay good. I think that is free. Fuck. I was just checking it. I didn't even check it. I had to
[5996.07s -> 6005.24s]  check it for fucking prints. I forgot I was on. Didn't I disable the camera? Are they checking the
[6005.24s -> 6019.66s]  footage right now? Too bad it's not anymore ink. Whatever I got 25 bucks. They don't care. All
[6019.66s -> 6028.26s]  right I need to talk to some people. Do you know who this is? Do you know this person? I saw them
[6028.26s -> 6043.32s]  somewhere around Little Parks. Interesting. Little Parks. Thank you. Appreciate it. What about you?
[6043.32s -> 6054.97s]  Have you seen this person? Little Parks. Where's Little Parks? How do I zoom the map out? Anybody
[6054.97s -> 6080.07s]  know? That's Kilian Dewitt's fingerprints on a crumpled piece of paper. Starting soon in Mercia
[6080.07s -> 6085.91s]  district anonymous work will come and share the load. Buy like turkey sandwich bar. Go to this
[6085.91s -> 6099.93s]  Kilian. You'll feel better for it. Tell them Rio Takahashi sent you. Can they print on this table?
[6104.65s -> 6140.39s]  E. Find Rio Takahashi. Okay. Hey there you are. Let's go. He's not gonna find shit. What? I have
[6140.39s -> 6161.14s]  pretty good leads right now. A sugar daddy? Okay. Sugar daddy or cola? I want a cola. Just throw
[6161.14s -> 6182.22s]  the baseball at this point. I don't want it. Can't even walk down the darn street anymore.
[6187.78s -> 6219.05s]  Okay. Let's go. I knew it was you. Anything unusual? Do you know this person? Little Parks.
[6219.05s -> 6249.24s]  Okay. Thanks for your help. Where does this person live? Sixth floor? Are they gonna let me in?
[6249.24s -> 6269.16s]  Cameras. Okay. I gotta play this well. I'm on camera right here. Here we go. This could be
[6269.16s -> 6321.46s]  the killer. I have to be prepared. Good evening. Look who it is. Look who it is. Ask you a few
[6321.46s -> 6333.18s]  questions. Excuse me. What is your name? I'm Rio Takahashi. What's it to you? Anything unusual
[6333.18s -> 6348.63s]  over the last few days? Nothing. Mind if I take a look around? You're welcome to. Come on in. Hey.
[6348.63s -> 6356.62s]  Hey, be careful. There's a killer out there. Did you provide your fingerprints for an investigation?
[6357.61s -> 6373.10s]  I guess if it's for an investigation. Fingerprints. What kind of fingerprints are they?
[6375.50s -> 6386.17s]  Shit. I was not done with my investigation. You said I could come in. Can I still come in?
[6387.86s -> 6411.59s]  Thank you. Reuben sandwich, hamburger, pepper, beer, vodka bourbon. Interesting. Interesting.
[6411.59s -> 6421.16s]  What a place you have here. Sorry. Do you like the detective routine in every television show?
[6423.37s -> 6426.33s]  Holy shit. I just, I just hit the absolute jackpot here. What do you have?
[6427.61s -> 6449.64s]  You've got beef bricks. Can I cook it? I think they're brushing their teeth.
[6451.32s -> 6464.46s]  Okay. Work. Accountant. 900 to 700. Monday through Friday. I don't know what that means,
[6464.46s -> 6482.66s]  but it's, I am just going to put it over here. This is another person. Who are you? Who are you?
[6482.66s -> 6489.70s]  Who are you? Are you another person? Oh, wait. How? That was, I thought you went this way.
[6489.70s -> 6515.06s]  Burger sandwiches. Okay. So all this proves is that you were at the restaurant. What about
[6515.06s -> 6552.62s]  fingerprints? Looking for B, right? Maybe you know who it is. You might fucking busy in here.
[6552.62s -> 6563.59s]  Okay. Can we have a compromise? Can I turn on one light? Why does this, why do you not want
[6563.59s -> 6582.33s]  any lights on in your entire house? How do you navigate this apartment? What time is it? It's
[6582.33s -> 6606.86s]  10 30. Barbecue sauce. Shit. This doesn't prove anything. I'm at a dead end. Actual dead end.
[6606.86s -> 6622.52s]  I thought that was an animal. I'm so jumpy today too. Wait, why am I still allowed in the house?
[6624.66s -> 6640.49s]  What? So can I like break into that safe? What's going on? What's happening? What's happening?
[6640.49s -> 6653.53s]  What's happening? What's happening? Hey, who the fuck are you? Oh, you think the darkness is your
[6653.53s -> 6671.94s]  ally. Where am I? Who is this person? Who is this person? Oh no. Okay. I didn't do anything.
[6672.34s -> 6691.58s]  I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. Citizen's arrest. What? After two hours?
[6691.58s -> 6711.93s]  What do I do? Okay. You're under. What do you mean? Huh? Do you see what just happened in here?
[6711.93s -> 6721.48s]  I guess, I guess if it's for an investigation. Fingerprints. What were they? These things hurt.
[6721.48s -> 6733.29s]  All right. What do you got on you in that shit? Who are you? Take their money and take their keys.
[6733.29s -> 6741.77s]  Yeah. Take it. I'm, I'm freaking out. Hold on. I gotta calm down. Who are you and what are you?
[6741.77s -> 6753.64s]  Automatic pistol. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Turn the lights on first of all. Um, um,
[6753.64s -> 6763.90s]  fingerprint. Yes. What's the fingerprint though? Is it B? Got you. You're under arrest. You're
[6763.90s -> 6778.41s]  under arrest for killing at least two people. Um, what do we do? Okay. How do I follow me down
[6778.41s -> 6785.03s]  the stairs? The victim has been shot to death with a pistol. I'm at death between 10 and 1045. I was
[6785.03s -> 6795.48s]  in the room. All right. How do I, what do I do? Is there a way I can, I can take you with me?
[6795.48s -> 6805.96s]  Just leave them there. Okay. What is the full name of the killer?
[6805.96s -> 6816.87s]  Right here. Arrest the killer. Yes. Do you have evidence that placed the killer at the crime scene?
[6816.87s -> 6823.30s]  I do. I'm standing at it right now. I'm standing at the crime scene. This has been a murder.
[6823.30s -> 6841.34s]  The fingerprints. Yep. Where's the fingerprints? Right here. Where does the killer live? I don't
[6841.34s -> 6852.36s]  know. Wasn't it on the, wait, I know. Uh, what was that? The thing I, I took the wallet. No, no, no,
[6852.36s -> 6866.23s]  stuff, stuff, stuff right here. And that I want to take the money out of this person's wallet.
[6866.23s -> 6885.77s]  Wait, I've got so much bullshit everywhere. Like arrest. Have you located the murder weapon? I've
[6885.77s -> 6893.61s]  got it. It's a gun, but I need to look at it again because I didn't pin it. Search them again.
[6893.61s -> 6906.26s]  Okay. Pin this. There we go. Here it is. Flot route to hand in. All right. You come with me.
[6906.26s -> 6926.31s]  Arrest. You're under arrest. It's closed. That was crazy. That was really, really crazy. Do I
[6926.31s -> 6939.56s]  actually have to walk with them or do I just turn it in? You just leave? I was in the, what was I
[6939.56s -> 6944.41s]  even doing in the other room? I'm okay. That was too much stimulation. I'm just going to go turn
[6944.41s -> 6962.82s]  this in. It was a box to check arrest. You didn't take it. No, no, no. I, no, I got it. Arrest.
[6962.82s -> 6974.82s]  Right here. I got it. Yeah. I got it. I got it. I got it. No, it checked. All right. Let's turn it
[6974.82s -> 6992.95s]  in. That was crazy. That was really cool though. That was fun. The thing we, honestly, we just got
[6992.95s -> 7004.44s]  into a random scenario. There is no connection between this person killing Killian. We have no
[7004.44s -> 7018.15s]  connection. We just were in the room when another person died. Just caught him red handed. Fingerprint.
[7018.15s -> 7026.76s]  That's true. Yeah, that's true. You're right. Okay. Let's go for it. Tutorial officially complete.
[7026.76s -> 7054.30s]  I think I understand how the game works. I thought I was getting shot at. Okay. Case submitted for
[7054.30s -> 7078.10s]  processing. Please wait for the results. I got five out of five. I got it. One assistant. I got
[7078.10s -> 7105.83s]  250 social credit. 2200 bucks. Social credit level up. Cool. Now what? I did it. Now you can
[7105.83s -> 7124.62s]  change your name. Change my name. Do I now just, do I get rid of all this now too? This is all
[7124.62s -> 7140.81s]  not active anymore. Upright. Archive closed. Oh, cool. So this has been resolved. Uh, close the
[7140.81s -> 7147.21s]  case. You can take a side quest now or wait for another murder. Really? I can't close it at this
[7147.21s -> 7166.49s]  moment. Why not? You don't have to wait for a murder. Murder someone then frame someone else.
[7167.13s -> 7179.38s]  I have to go back to the apartment. There's still more. Like this apartment? Wait, which apartment?
[7180.02s -> 7214.01s]  Fine. This is a mess. I know it is. Sit on your bench with your watch out. It's locked. How do I
[7214.01s -> 7218.74s]  just, where even is my house? Just start a new sandbox game at this point. The game gets glitchy
[7218.74s -> 7226.66s]  and dead of night after the murder. Okay. That makes sense to me. All right. So sandbox. Solve
[7226.66s -> 7242.49s]  and explore within the city your way. Generate a city. And Franklin's fine. Medium's fine. And
[7242.49s -> 7260.10s]  let's do random. The game should be, did you even save? Yeah, I did. Okay. Seems pretty good. Let's
[7260.10s -> 7270.22s]  go. Yeah. Uh, did I get one guide? I may have, but they said it was, um, one guy said that sometimes
[7270.22s -> 7286.31s]  it can bug out after that case. Shadows of doubt. One guy is actually correct. Okay. That was fun.
[7286.31s -> 7297.45s]  This game's giving me a migraine. Can you please turn off all the lights and watch videos of fish?
[7297.45s -> 7313.45s]  I'm sorry. I mean, I do enjoy videos of fish, but not right now. Give me one day. How big do
[7313.45s -> 7325.24s]  you think I can get this? So sandbox mode, something just happens and I have to figure it out.
[7336.28s -> 7352.82s]  Shave your face, you cretin. I'm going to try to look as gross as I can. You know what I mean?
[7354.57s -> 7363.72s]  I've never tried that before. You know, it always hits, it always hits a time when I haven't had a
[7363.72s -> 7367.64s]  haircut in a while. I haven't shaved in a while and I'm like, okay, all right. It's time to clean
[7367.64s -> 7374.49s]  up a little. Um, I think, I don't know. I just think, what if I just, just let it all go and
[7374.57s -> 7381.70s]  just, let's see what happens after like a month, two months. No, like I'm going to get a trim and
[7381.70s -> 7391.94s]  clean it up. No, no. Eyebrows. Just go for it and see what happens. Right now. Holly is probably
[7391.94s -> 7405.29s]  sitting there going like, okay, yeah, let me just look like fucking crazed. Uh, no tutorial. I just
[7405.29s -> 7425.98s]  turned it on. I thought it said no. I am fucking out of my mind. Can I, I seriously thought it
[7425.98s -> 7454.09s]  said no. It's all right. I could probably still use them. Jumpster. Crash. What's in it? Evening.
[7454.65s -> 7493.69s]  Evening. Sorry. Nothing. Don't worry about it. I just, I was trying to investigate. Hacking tape.
[7493.69s -> 7499.30s]  By default, they will be reported murder. Where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where?
[7502.95s -> 7511.74s]  New murder case. Crime scene. 1001 gray building. You also have access to a city district map that
[7511.74s -> 7523.78s]  you have toggle up with. Where is it? 1001 gray building. Use the map with F.
[7531.69s -> 7542.55s]  There we go. That's what I was looking for. Okay. Gray building. 1001 gray building. Is that a name
[7542.55s -> 7562.28s]  of street or the name of a building? I can use this search. Wait, the color. No, it's not. Context
[7562.28s -> 7589.16s]  menu. Search top left. Gray. Oh, there it is. We get out of the way. As you know, there's been a
[7589.16s -> 7598.34s]  murder. Depending on your activity, different kinds of status. Yep. Yep. Yep. I already know
[7598.34s -> 7624.04s]  that. All right. What happened? Where are you? Where are you going? 10th floor. Let's go. I don't
[7624.04s -> 7648.76s]  know what happened there. Sound the alarm. Sound the alarm. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here, detective.
[7648.76s -> 7666.89s]  I'm here. I'm a detective. Open it up. Sound the alarm. I'm here. How do I open the door? I did.
[7668.33s -> 7676.12s]  You need to get out of there. What do you mean? No. I, how do I turn it off? I don't know what,
[7680.65s -> 7686.73s]  what do I do? I don't know what to do. I don't know what happened. What's going on? What's going on?
[7686.73s -> 7693.30s]  What's going on? Help. Help. Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off.
[7695.88s -> 7703.90s]  Ah! What the fuck? What's happening? What? It's the killer. That's the killer. That's the killer
[7703.90s -> 7711.03s]  right there. There's a killer. There's a killer. There's a killer. Stop this guy.
[7723.54s -> 7733.80s]  Shotgun. I don't understand what just happened. I'm so confused. I saw his face. I know what he
[7733.80s -> 7745.22s]  looks like. He's bald and he's got glasses. I know. That dude shot me point blank like 10 times.
[7745.22s -> 7750.92s]  He's bald and he's got glasses. I'm going, I know, I know what he looks like. Medical fees.
[7752.92s -> 7762.50s]  Get the fuck out of here. Don't you understand? There's a killer on the loose.
[7771.42s -> 7791.03s]  All right. Where is this guy? I'm going back there. Have any food? I'll take whatever you got.
[7791.59s -> 7820.06s]  How do I buy something? I need, I need the hospital right now. No. God damn it. I just like alt tab.
[7820.06s -> 7838.06s]  There we go. Where is the hospital? Hospital. Doctor. Drugstore. Come on. Come on. Come on. Hurry
[7838.06s -> 7843.58s]  up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Go, go, go, go, go. Why is it? What's going on?
[7843.58s -> 7883.99s]  Where'd it go? Hey, bandage. Where's all my money? Medical fees? What are you talking about? I had
[7883.99s -> 7894.66s]  2200 bucks five minutes ago. That was a different save file. Oh, that's actually awful. Shit. Okay.
[7895.98s -> 7915.29s]  Now that's why I shouldn't have left. Shit. Um, am I actually screwed here? Or if I just reload
[7915.29s -> 7938.04s]  this, will it fix it? Just rob the medicine cabinet. I guess I could fuck off with this.
[7938.04s -> 7959.77s]  Oh, you got like trophies back here. Where's this? Where's the medicine? What time is this?
[7959.77s -> 7968.86s]  I'm just going to start over. That got so screwed up. I went there. There's somebody screaming at
[7968.86s -> 7972.86s]  me. Turn the alarm on. I turn the alarm on. A guy with a shotgun shoots me five times in the face
[7972.86s -> 7995.34s]  and then I get up. I think I'm just going to restart. I'm just going to restart. You're a
[7995.34s -> 8006.31s]  bigger public menace than the murderer. Okay. Let's try this again. That was that. That one
[8006.31s -> 8018.78s]  actually doesn't count. Sorry. I'm so jumpy. That was kind of a mess though. Give me a little bit
[8018.78s -> 8031.38s]  of slack. So in conclusion, you trespassed, started breaking a fire alarm, got shot, ran from the
[8031.38s -> 8039.85s]  hospital, robbed a drug store and gave up. There was somebody behind the screen screaming for me,
[8039.85s -> 8047.66s]  please, please sound the alarm. I just did what I saw. There was an opportunity to maybe get some
[8047.66s -> 8054.33s]  more people to help and maybe we need something happened here. I was told to do it. I pulled it
[8054.33s -> 8059.27s]  and then I couldn't turn it off. I couldn't get into that side of the apartment building
[8059.27s -> 8070.98s]  and then a shotgun was in my face. Does that mean that I get to have a shotgun at some point?
[8070.98s -> 8086.86s]  I mean, it has to imply that I can use a shotgun at some point. This game is crazy. This is fun.
[8086.86s -> 8096.57s]  I like this. I'm just choked. You sabotage the alarm. Yeah. Well, I just, I don't know,
[8096.57s -> 8117.74s]  there's a lot of loud sounds. Okay. Oh, here we go. Let's get this started. This is the real
[8117.90s -> 8128.79s]  one now. No one messing around. This is the real deal. We already know the story here.
[8128.79s -> 8139.99s]  We can just skip this, right? Okay. Here we go. 6 PM, Monday, January 2nd, Carpenter Street.
[8140.71s -> 8155.05s]  How you doing? What's your name? I'm Joanne Callahan. What's it to you? Have a good day.
[8158.79s -> 8170.34s]  Whatever. What's the world coming to? Everybody really wants to be around this fire.
[8171.06s -> 8189.48s]  Wait, there's a lot of people here. Okay. Is the fight breaking out? Somebody said I had enough.
[8190.20s -> 8205.72s]  Hey you, this street is a toll. Pay up. Get lost. You'll regret this decision. What is going?
[8206.36s -> 8210.74s]  This person, this person has a knife. This person has a knife. This person has a knife.
[8211.70s -> 8228.71s]  Help. This person has a knife. Get, am I being attacked by all of you now? This person has a
[8228.71s -> 8247.10s]  knife. Get out of the way. Are you serious? I have to run. I have to run. Somebody help me.
[8247.10s -> 8253.85s]  Somebody help. I'm being chased. I'm being chased. I'm being chased. I'm being chased.
[8256.60s -> 8276.89s]  I don't know what I'm supposed to do, but please help. Get away from me. Dude, how do I call the
[8276.89s -> 8282.63s]  police? How do I? Murder. There's been a murder. There's been a murder. It's probably one of you.
[8283.59s -> 8303.03s]  A new murder case. 1102. What was it? Bryant Terrace. Where am I? You are the police.
[8304.62s -> 8320.79s]  That was so fucked up. Why? 1102. Now I have to go to the hospital again. I don't even have any
[8320.79s -> 8331.93s]  money. I got jumped. I didn't even identify any of those people either. I was just so fucked up.
[8337.38s -> 8355.38s]  Help. Help. Help. Help. Wait. Was this the person that had the knife? Come here. Get over here.
[8355.38s -> 8372.54s]  Get over here. It was... Give me a second. Okay. I'm going to give you a second. I'm going to give
[8372.54s -> 8394.70s]  you the count of three before I drop you. Why am I the bad guy here? This doesn't make any sense.
[8394.70s -> 8426.82s]  I don't want to get... Who is this? Are these... Oh, thanks for showing up. Thanks for helping.
[8426.82s -> 8434.47s]  They went over here. They went this way. They're right here. It was... No, wait. Where are they?
[8434.47s -> 8451.05s]  What is happening? I don't know. I think they're after... I don't know who they're after. Wait. Oh.
[8451.05s -> 8477.00s]  I'm just going to die. I need to restart again. I got stabbed 10 times. No reason. Where are we?
[8477.00s -> 8483.24s]  What are we doing? Somebody's in the building. There's a murderer in the building. Are they still
[8483.24s -> 8502.82s]  here? Someone... Okay. There's something going on. How many... Why did you... I should have just taken
[8502.82s -> 8536.38s]  the elevator. What am I doing? What floor am I on? How do I get in here? How do I get in there?
[8536.38s -> 8571.86s]  All right. Let's do an investigation here. Can I come in and help? Is that the right house?
[8571.86s -> 8586.89s]  1102. One... Why is this... Why is this... There is a... Is there a... There is a body on the ground.
[8586.89s -> 8596.26s]  Oh my god. Somebody's in the... Don't... No. Wait, wait, wait. I... What are you doing? Stop.
[8599.53s -> 8608.74s]  Oh my god, guys. What have I done? I... Your... This shit is backwards. Your door number is
[8608.74s -> 8619.67s]  backwards. What? Who has the gun? Get me out. Get me... Be careful. Careful. Careful. Careful.
[8619.67s -> 8629.93s]  Careful. Who has a gun? Do you... Let me in. Let me in. I'm out on the fucking deck. Let me in.
[8632.47s -> 8640.41s]  I'm out on the fucking ledge. Can I... Somebody let me in? They locked me out. They locked me out on
[8640.41s -> 8664.42s]  the ledge. Oh no. Shit. How do I get back in? What the fuck? I have to... I... There's nowhere
[8664.42s -> 8670.52s]  to go. I have to restart the whole fucking thing. Oh my god. I... There's nowhere to go. I was stuck.
[8670.52s -> 8715.00s]  Damn it. That was so ridiculous. The window opened. You can't... WM1A murder investigation.
[8715.00s -> 8720.41s]  Yeah, but... Well, hold on though. Let's calm down and think about this for a second.
[8720.79s -> 8728.90s]  The last couple... I've tried to generate new seeds. The first seed. I just get attacked. I just get
[8728.90s -> 8734.74s]  stabbed and chased and four people are attacking me, killing me. No, that's not even the first one.
[8734.74s -> 8741.94s]  A shotgun pointed in my face. Shot. Boom. I get surrounded and attacked. I go up with the police
[8741.94s -> 8746.26s]  to help investigate and all of a sudden they start shooting. There's like... People... That was the
[8746.26s -> 8749.54s]  killer in there apparently because they went... They had like... They were firing at each other.
[8749.54s -> 8756.46s]  I get pushed out to the balcony. I'm just standing out there. I don't even know what
[8756.46s -> 8769.26s]  happened. You're a private detective? You can't be at the crime scene. You're not part of the police.
[8776.44s -> 8785.56s]  This game is wonderful. This is really fun. It's just... Things can just happen. Everybody is just
[8785.56s -> 8803.50s]  doing something. This is great. Okay. I'm getting some advice in the chat. I'm going to listen to
[8803.50s -> 8813.85s]  it. I'm going to save immediately after loading up the game. Looks good. Okay. No more insanity. No
[8813.85s -> 8822.46s]  more craziness. No more wild behavior from my end. I'm good. I am going to just simply walk down the
[8822.46s -> 8840.14s]  street like a normal citizen. I'm just hanging out. How are you? It's good to see you. It's okay.
[8840.78s -> 8860.70s]  People like it. I guess. Ain't no pleasing you is there. Both coughed. What's your name?
[8860.70s -> 8909.06s]  Keep your nose out of my business. Okay. Nobody saw shit? All right. Just running around with a
[8909.06s -> 8928.74s]  hammer. What was that? That was weird. I'm just waiting for a murder. This is weird. This game's
[8928.74s -> 8954.25s]  kind of... I'm on edge right now. What's your name? Seen anything unusual? No. When people sprint
[8954.25s -> 8977.06s]  around, it makes me nervous. He just has a knife. I think I'm going to just follow this person.
[9002.52s -> 9021.26s]  You strolled down the wrong street, pal. Give me your crows. Can I have that broom? I need a phone.
[9021.26s -> 9026.02s]  I need a phone. I need a phone. I need a phone. I need a telephone right now. Is there a working
[9026.02s -> 9041.94s]  telephone in here? You have a working telephone? You have a working telephone in here? I need to
[9041.94s -> 9055.34s]  get a look at you. I need to like inspect. Shit. I got to find a brick or something and throw it.
[9055.34s -> 9083.72s]  Give me a brick. Come on. Give me a... Oh my god. Am I in trouble? Am I in trouble? Did I kill this
[9083.72s -> 9098.76s]  person? Okay. Well, y'all, you're in trouble. There's no active case. Would you like to create
[9098.76s -> 9123.19s]  one? Yes. You attacked me with a knife. Okay. We got it. We have an ID. Potential. Fine. What?
[9123.19s -> 9180.89s]  I just took somebody's key. Wait. A knife. No. Pick up the whole toaster. How has that not been
[9180.89s -> 9189.18s]  a murder? Oh shit. I did steal this. I did walk out with the toaster. I did not mean to steal it.
[9189.18s -> 9204.63s]  Why am I freezing right now? Why am I so cold? Can I not put the toaster in my inventory? I'll bring
[9204.63s -> 9237.35s]  it back. Here. I accidentally took this. Take it back. I didn't mean to take that. I can't
[9237.35s -> 9276.47s]  go into the registers for investigative purposes. Why am I so cold? There's been no murder. I'm gonna
[9276.47s -> 9290.52s]  buy a hot dog or something. What do you got here? Can I buy anything? How do I buy food? Do you know
[9290.52s -> 9306.15s]  this person? Okay. Whatever. We'll eat some raw meat. I think I need... I only have 100 bucks,
[9306.15s -> 9328.38s]  I guess. What do I need? A bandage? Oh, a heat pack. Here we go. And then... Did that not work?
[9335.64s -> 9348.34s]  Oh, this is nice. Did I get some food too? All right. I'm gonna have something to eat.
[9348.98s -> 9373.53s]  How about a coffee and a donut? Oh, a cheeseburger sounds pretty good. Okay.
[9374.71s -> 9391.58s]  Uh, close the case. Case closed. Okay, I did it. What's your name? I'm Sawyer Barnett. Why?
[9391.58s -> 9428.66s]  Anything unusual? No? Can I have some money? Thank you. Somebody just called and said I was broke.
[9428.66s -> 9436.90s]  Well, I had 2,200 bucks. Not anymore. I solved the first case and then I had to change seeds.
[9443.43s -> 9447.11s]  Work available for a discrete individual. Business related concerns require investigation.
[9447.11s -> 9452.73s]  Significant fee available for the right person. Financial compensation. A rare sink disc.
[9452.73s -> 9471.67s]  Ooh. 1,400 bucks. I'll take it. 8835611. Okay. What was it? I already forgot. I already forgot.
[9472.31s -> 9491.40s]  Okay, let's do it. Oh, it's in... Hear about the job. Meet me at Isaiah's Cafe. I'll be sitting
[9491.40s -> 9499.56s]  with a coffee. Ask about Thompson. Make it sharp. Won't he be here for much longer?
[9500.36s -> 9522.52s]  Then don't fucking talk my ear off. This is you? Wait, are we already here? Okay. What's it called?
[9523.00s -> 9570.87s]  Thompson? No. What was it called? Oh, yeah. Run? That's so good. Doing good. Thanks for asking.
[9571.51s -> 9579.96s]  Is this you? Wait, you said you're gonna have a coffee. Who? Who is it? We all have coffees.
[9596.54s -> 9608.31s]  That has to be you. Okay. Is this Thompson? Good, you made it. I need you to steal an important
[9608.31s -> 9616.41s]  document. It'll be in a sealed red and brown envelope. The leads for the target are in this
[9616.41s -> 9631.22s]  briefcase. Take it. It's taking so much to not throw the briefcase right back at this person's
[9631.22s -> 9673.98s]  face. Okay. How do I... How do I take this shit out of here? It's already... Oh, okay. Save now,
[9673.98s -> 9713.06s]  please. Save now. I got it. He looks so unwell. Pick it up. Locate and steal the item from the
[9713.06s -> 9736.82s]  mark. A secret envelope. Do we know anything about this person? Apparently they're here somewhere.
[9736.82s -> 9743.64s]  Read their profile. There's nothing here. Short black hair. Large build.
[9748.58s -> 9824.87s]  10th floor. All right. 10th floor. I'm biting my lip. Okay. Let's go. Stop. Stop biting your lip.
[9824.87s -> 9861.82s]  Stop it. Stop. Okay. I'm done. All right. So let's get it... Let's do this correctly here.
[9861.82s -> 9877.18s]  Large. Short black hair. Size 12. He's on the 10th floor. Short black hair. Large. What do we got?
[9877.18s -> 9926.46s]  This person is naked. Okay. I don't think that was the right person, first of all. Are we good?
[9926.46s -> 10005.38s]  I don't think anybody's... I don't know which one is correct. Ow! I just went... Okay. Camera right
[10005.38s -> 10015.00s]  here. I have to get... Turn this camera off. There we go. Am I gonna get in trouble for doing this?
[10015.00s -> 10036.22s]  Turn this shit off. God damn it. Get those back on. All right. We're good. I didn't mean to do that,
[10036.22s -> 10059.69s]  but okay. Somebody's phone is ringing in here. I don't even know if this is the right house.
[10059.69s -> 10103.75s]  This is the right house. God damn it. That's so stupid. Okay. I don't have the... I don't think
[10103.75s -> 10116.42s]  I have this correct. I need more info. I'm just gonna go... I'm going back outside. This is... I'm
[10116.42s -> 10142.36s]  not... This is bad. What time is it? Can I just sit on the ground for the first guy again? The naked
[10142.36s -> 10174.49s]  guy? Close on this time. How are you? What's your name? Anything unusual? No. Do you know... I don't
[10174.49s -> 10215.53s]  care. Never mind. Fuck off. Somebody opened the door. I heard a door open. Short black hair.
[10215.53s -> 10222.82s]  Large build. I don't know. Sorry. Wait. Can I... Can I come in? What's your name? What's it gonna do
[10222.82s -> 10247.38s]  with you? Do you mind if I come in and take a look around? Jesus. Okay. I don't... I don't think it's
[10247.38s -> 10269.27s]  you. It's not you. So I've narrowed it down to two doors. The cameras are back on. Oh shit. They are.
[10269.27s -> 10318.34s]  Okay. Murder! That's literally right here. That's right here. It's in the same building. Go, go,
[10318.34s -> 10360.22s]  go, go, go. I got it right now. Before I do this, is this possible? All right. You're under arrest.
[10360.22s -> 10369.53s]  You're under arrest. You're under... You are under arrest. You're under arrest. You are. You... You're
[10369.61s -> 10389.88s]  under arrest right now. You're under arrest. I think. Um, this is a cop? What? That's a cop?
[10389.88s -> 10417.34s]  No, it's not. They're not even here yet. That's a cop. Okay. All right. Where's the body? Where's the
[10417.34s -> 10447.93s]  body? Files. Here we are. Luke Woters. Get that gone. Get that gone. You gotta find the body.
[10447.93s -> 10465.83s]  This is the wrong place. Is it? Are you sure? Why was the cop in here then? That wasn't a cop.
[10465.83s -> 10516.73s]  Am I even in... What is the 901? How do I get this guy to get out of here? What's your name?
[10516.73s -> 10526.57s]  Hello. I'm... Oh, of course. Okay. Luke Woters. Anything unusual? Nothing. There's an investigation.
[10526.57s -> 10544.42s]  Can I get your fingerprints? Thank you very much. Appreciate it. We do have fingerprints.
[10544.98s -> 10562.95s]  Type B. Just in case. I don't need this right now. Let's go. So, I need you to go away. Because I
[10562.95s -> 10577.40s]  need to get in here. Is there a camera? There is. I need you to go away. Really appreciate it. No,
[10577.40s -> 10583.62s]  you're still here. This is your house, right? That's your house. Look. There's a... There was a noise
[10583.62s -> 10591.40s]  in there. Didn't you hear that? Did you hear the noise in your apartment? This is... I heard it.
[10591.40s -> 10596.94s]  Something's fucked up in there, I think. You better go and check it out. You don't hear that?
[10597.50s -> 10618.10s]  How do I... Will he even see this? All right. Save it just in case he sees. Does he see it?
[10618.10s -> 10647.24s]  I have no lockpicks. Will you look somewhere else? You're just staring at me. You know what?
[10647.24s -> 10682.04s]  Oh my god. He didn't even go in. Dispatch, do you copy? I didn't know you had to click again.
[10682.04s -> 10690.97s]  Oh my god. Okay, for those of you that are watching at home, if you click drink on anything,
[10690.97s -> 10697.96s]  it's not just drink until you let go of click. You have to click again to stop drinking. Okay.
[10706.42s -> 10718.58s]  This is awful. My controls are backwards. I just gotta wait till everybody leaves and then I can
[10718.58s -> 10733.14s]  go in there and... Oh my god. Your drunk movement speed and control penalty. This'll disappear on
[10733.14s -> 10742.74s]  its own. Coming. What? Can I even look in here? I'm not allowed in here. You gotta be shitting me.
[10742.74s -> 10747.54s]  I'm just drinking. I'm just drinking and walking around. There's nothing weird. See? I'm just
[10747.54s -> 10761.83s]  drinking. That's it. I'm allowed to drink in my own property. No, dude. I can't walk forward.
[10763.98s -> 10773.40s]  I can't walk forward. Orsis, open up. Where have they gone? Wait, why are you opening up this door?
[10773.40s -> 10825.40s]  I was just gonna sit in the corner. I just shattered my ankle. Okay. Have you completed
[10825.40s -> 10856.44s]  your investigation? Can I go in there now? Or no? Can I not go in here? Hey! I'm just...
[10871.67s -> 10883.02s]  Damn it. Get up. Get up. When I press W, it moves backwards, by the way.
[10887.94s -> 10893.85s]  Although I'm not in any shape to do an investigation right now. Where's the body?
[10897.80s -> 10905.16s]  Oh, wait. What's this? Oh, okay. Might as well. Hey, hair of the dog, don't they say?
[10913.64s -> 10923.42s]  Was that... Where's that body? I'm gonna find out where it is. What does it say?
[10923.42s -> 10932.30s]  Who cares about this bullshit? Release cigarettes. Good. Yeah, I guess I'll take that.
[10934.66s -> 10954.42s]  Oh my god. Where is the body, though? I have to stop. What does it say? The bandit? What does it
[10954.42s -> 10964.90s]  say? It says something... Bandit? The bandit? The pin... The pinini? What is it? I don't know
[10964.90s -> 10980.50s]  what that says. Go to sleep in their bed. All right. I gotta... I gotta... Dude. I have to... Okay.
[10981.38s -> 10992.95s]  I'm crawling right now. Oh, this sucks. This hurts. How do I stop? You need to puke. How?
[10997.90s -> 11008.79s]  What? Can I... Will this help? Oh no, that made it worse.
[11015.34s -> 11039.96s]  God damn it. I don't even know where this person's bed is. Just sit down. Sit down. This is hard to
[11039.96s -> 11059.29s]  even look at. This sucks to even look at. Go to the toilet? Just... Can I sleep here? How do I
[11059.29s -> 11076.81s]  pull the watch up and sleep? There it is. Watch. Okay. How do I sleep? You can't sleep while
[11076.81s -> 11088.54s]  trespassing. Oh, here it is. No. Wait. No, no, no. I don't want anyone to see what I'm doing.
[11088.54s -> 11097.30s]  Here's the bathroom. All right. Puke. Am I imagining that or is that real?
[11103.90s -> 11113.02s]  Is that me thinking that? I gotta take a shower. Can I take a shower? How long am I going to be
[11113.02s -> 11133.78s]  drunk for? I can't turn it on. Just throw some water in my face. Oh my god. What if I... I'm just
[11133.78s -> 11136.97s]  going to turn the lights off so we don't have to suffer looking at this. I'm just going to look
[11136.97s -> 11169.22s]  at the ground. Uh oh. Use the toilet. I can't. Can I sit on the toilet? I can't sit on the toilet.
[11169.78s -> 11181.43s]  There's no body even in here, by the way. And if it's not, I can't. Press G. I can puke with G.
[11181.43s -> 11193.26s]  No, I can't. That's a lie. I am actually... Okay, I need to reload the save. Find a trash can.
[11196.34s -> 11215.03s]  Find a trash can? That's the solution? Right here. I can't puke in it. I can't puke in it.
[11221.94s -> 11234.44s]  I can't puke in any receptacle. Sit on the couch. All right, this actually is starting... This is
[11234.44s -> 11250.09s]  going to hurt everyone's brain. Go drink water. Press G on the toilet. Jump off the landing.
[11250.09s -> 11288.18s]  Just jump out and reload. Oh, it's getting better. Do a flip? Press G, dude. G doesn't do anything.
[11288.18s -> 11309.38s]  Use your watch to wait. I don't think I can do anything. Sit and use the watch. I'm just
[11309.38s -> 11317.91s]  trying to get out of here. Jump. I'm giving this 30 more seconds than I'm reloading. I actually
[11318.23s -> 11326.97s]  didn't even do that. I didn't do that. I actually just walked off there accidentally.
[11326.97s -> 11337.11s]  I didn't do that. When I press W, he picks a random direction and walks. I have a bad egg.
[11337.11s -> 11358.73s]  I've been arrested. Three stooges aren't in Fortnite yet. Yeah, it's fucked up. I've been
[11358.73s -> 11366.10s]  pissed off about it for at least a few years. Oh, I feel so great now. I can actually see what's
[11366.10s -> 11400.76s]  happening. Okay, let's get back into that apartment. I am fresh, although I should collect the thing
[11400.76s -> 11415.99s]  from City Hall, right? To be on the case. Oh, this is City Hall. Case of the Corpo Assassin.
[11415.99s -> 11433.42s]  You got it. Back to it. I got a rash when I opened my Grotto Beast pack. I don't think we had
[11433.42s -> 11447.10s]  anything to do with that. Where does the killer live? What weapon? Do you have evidence that...
[11447.10s -> 11468.47s]  Okay. Let's see if I can get in there now. Ninth floor. I know. I just want to... I have to
[11468.47s -> 11477.16s]  apologize to everybody here. Yes. I am the guy last night that was drunk and walked off the banister.
[11477.16s -> 11485.42s]  I just want to say sorry. I caused a little bit of a problem for everybody. I may have walked around
[11485.42s -> 11492.42s]  and I think I knocked on a bunch of people's doors. I was trying to find the killer, I think,
[11493.14s -> 11509.78s]  was what that was, I believe. Oh, this is my friend. What's going on? Luke? Luke is shitfaced.
[11509.78s -> 11549.70s]  Remember when I had the katana? Remember that? That was kind of cool. I know. Just take the elevator.
[11549.70s -> 11573.21s]  Okay. Just take that. Oh my goodness. Thing. I look... There's one... There's two floors up.
[11573.21s -> 11602.15s]  Why did I even get in here? Okay. It's time to start my investigation. Save it here. Okay.
[11602.15s -> 11629.69s]  Where's the body? I thought that was a knife. Oh, this is not the right place. This is wrong.
[11629.69s -> 11641.48s]  I just took his glasses. Come on. What are you doing? What are you thinking? How do I put... I
[11641.48s -> 11658.49s]  want to take... I want to put those down. Am I wearing them? Okay. That was wrong. It's this one
[11658.49s -> 11689.77s]  here. Go. All right. What do we got? Fingerprints. Let's look. There's no body though. Weirdly enough.
[11689.77s -> 11730.30s]  Where's the body? Type C. Type C? Where's the pin to pin in it? To pin in it. What does this
[11730.30s -> 11747.67s]  say? Put a pin in it? All right. I need to find the key... The keypad. All right. You got something
[11747.67s -> 11764.54s]  here. Type C. Money. All right. What is this? Probably a mine. Lots of fingerprints. Anybody
[11764.54s -> 11802.76s]  else in here? Just C for now. Cigarette. No. C. C. Where's the body? Oh, food. This is a mess. I
[11802.76s -> 11813.00s]  have to get rid of all this stuff. Why is this even pinned? This shouldn't be pinned either. This
[11813.00s -> 11831.70s]  guy has nothing to do with any of this. It's a newspaper. Why am I even... Okay. Cool. Dirty
[11831.70s -> 11878.34s]  plate. Type C. Can I smoke this? Oh, okay. Is this who lived here? Candy. Matchbox. Is that a knife?
[11878.34s -> 11902.62s]  Utility knife? Read the newspaper again. Oh, I have a knife now. Did I stab myself? No. Okay,
[11902.62s -> 11934.70s]  good. What's that? Matchbook. Soap. Find the body, please. Where is it? There's no other rooms.
[11936.74s -> 11968.98s]  Is this a clue? Put a pin in it. Hold on. Birth control pills? Okay. Birth control pills. What's
[11968.98s -> 11992.14s]  this? Oh. Didn't have what it takes. Kill to get ahead. They must earn my respect. Fingerprints
[11992.14s -> 11998.98s]  probably match, right? The wound caused by a sharp object or blade. Where was anybody? It was appears
[11998.98s -> 12002.50s]  the victim has been slashed to death by a bladed weapon. I can determine the time of death is
[12002.50s -> 12014.23s]  between 1745 and 1900. Monday, January 2nd, 1979. And that... All right. So what do we got?
[12017.02s -> 12024.36s]  Yin is the one line on the ground here. Fingerprints. Those are fingerprints. We've
[12024.36s -> 12037.66s]  got them. Type C. All right. So we know that you worked here at Revenue Tree Networks.
[12037.66s -> 12045.50s]  I'm not done investigating yet, but I know what I'm looking for. Is that it?
[12046.63s -> 12069.96s]  That's it. That's also it. Okay. So now, now what? Any prints here? Maybe this prints. Type D. Relax.
[12069.96s -> 12076.66s]  We got Type D fingerprints. And that's on the business card that says, didn't have what it
[12076.66s -> 12083.62s]  takes to... Like I'm going to kill you or whatever. Okay. We're looking for this person, Type D.
[12083.62s -> 12100.49s]  They had a business card. All right. Now what is that? Revenue Tree Networks. Yeah. Head of HR.
[12100.49s -> 12106.49s]  901 Robert Heights. Yep. That's where we are now. I'm just going to hold onto it.
[12106.49s -> 12112.82s]  And then there's a note. Yin, remember your passcode this time. Count backwards from 9.
[12112.82s -> 12142.41s]  I got to see what's in there. Take a look. 8 7 6 5. 9 8 7 6. Nothing in here. It must have been
[12142.41s -> 12158.17s]  stolen. Actually weird. Why is nothing in there? Fingerprints. Good call. Let's try it. Okay.
[12158.25s -> 12181.94s]  Okay. This is your fingerprints. No one else was in here. No. I don't think any thing... Nothing
[12181.94s -> 12192.90s]  out of the ordinary here. Oh, what about the computer? There was another name in the computer,
[12192.90s -> 12223.85s]  wasn't there? Check it out. Telephone number. Okay. We've got emails. Request of your help.
[12224.41s -> 12231.46s]  Hello dear Yin Zhu. I need your help. I have become stuck overseas after being mugged
[12231.46s -> 12238.98s]  dreadfully. I have no papers and I'm greatly nervous. Please send me one fifteen hundred

[12336.65s -> 12353.59s]  Fingerprints. It's possible that you have type D. It's a spam. I'm sorry it won't happen again.
[12353.59s -> 12356.87s]  I swear to tell the truth things have been tough at home and I know it has been affecting my work
[12356.87s -> 12361.05s]  but I swear I'll do better from now on. I'll work overtime to catch up. Please give me a few weeks
[12361.05s -> 12383.51s]  to prove myself. Oh Detective Bugleberry's on the case. So we have some we have some people here.
[12389.56s -> 12403.06s]  Okay so this is all spam. So we need to find these other people. What do you got in here?
[12403.06s -> 12420.31s]  Employment contract. Okay let's go to revenue tree networks. All right revenue tree networks. That
[12420.31s -> 12424.79s]  is where we are going. We're going to find out who works there. We're going to find out what's going
[12424.79s -> 12449.03s]  on here. What about prints on the files? Not a bad idea. It doesn't look like it. She's moving.
[12449.03s -> 12471.02s]  You're live? I don't know. Okay let's go. That's weird. Stop biting your lip. You guys need to
[12471.02s -> 12484.92s]  tell me to stop when I do that. I'm relying on you. All right that was fairly clean this time.
[12484.92s -> 12523.93s]  Let's go to the work. I'll save it when I get up. What should I name my baby? Frank. All right let's
[12523.93s -> 12545.24s]  move. I do have a weapon though. I have a knife now. Do you know what I wanted to try? Because
[12545.24s -> 12554.06s]  I've never really had it. I think I've only had it maybe once ever. White Castle. Is White Castle
[12554.06s -> 12561.67s]  any good? I saw like this this fucking like YouTube video where it showed how they make it.
[12561.67s -> 12569.99s]  Did you guys know? Am I completely full of shit here? But they make these little patties. These
[12569.99s -> 12576.79s]  little squares. And they put five holes. One two three four five. Almost looks like a dice.
[12578.18s -> 12584.57s]  And they put it on a flat top. And they don't flip it. They don't flip the burger. They put
[12584.57s -> 12592.63s]  it on the flat top. It's so small. They put it on a bed of onions. It's on a bed of chopped onions.
[12592.63s -> 12597.03s]  They put the meat right on top. And then the steam from the water. They put a bun on top.
[12597.03s -> 12603.50s]  And it cooks the other side too. And then they pick it up weirdly. I also saw that YouTube short.
[12603.50s -> 12614.17s]  Yeah I did too. I just wanted it. It made me want it. Has anybody in this chat eaten White Castle
[12614.17s -> 12643.91s]  before? Yes. Yes. Yes. It's very bad. It's repulsive. What? It's good. It's good. It's good.
[12644.47s -> 12655.08s]  It's amazing. It's ass. It's average. It's good in a disgusting way. All right. What was I doing
[12655.08s -> 12669.56s]  going up? Right? What am I even doing here? Is this the business? Revenue Tree Networks. It is. Is
[12669.56s -> 12673.24s]  the business just in somebody's apartment or something? Or is it? No this is an office.
[12674.20s -> 12705.62s]  What um where is it? What floor is it on? White Castle fucking sucks dude. I feel like people
[12705.62s -> 12716.44s]  are too harsh. I can't imagine driving through the White Castle drive through with holding up
[12716.44s -> 12722.34s]  the glasses on the stick. The mustache and like slick back hair and stuff. Just go and eat it.
[12722.34s -> 12726.63s]  Is it really that bad? Like you're going to White Castle. You know what you're doing. You know what
[12726.63s -> 12733.11s]  you're getting. It's just it's fast food. Just like a fast food burger. Nothing wrong with that.
[12733.91s -> 12754.30s]  Okay here it is. I am afraid to open this door. Is there okay there's a sentry gun in there.
[12754.30s -> 12768.55s]  Is that a camera? All right. How do I? I gotta do this right. I'm an idiot. McDonald's is the best
[12768.55s -> 12780.47s]  restaurant in the world. Why do I feel like you were standing up hovering over your microphone
