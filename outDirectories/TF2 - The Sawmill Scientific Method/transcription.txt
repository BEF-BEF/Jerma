[1.02s -> 5.24s]  God damn it all. Here's a pyro on that point, fellas.
[5.24s -> 9.16s]  Don't worry, I'll take care of this. I take care of pyros all the time.
[9.16s -> 10.28s]  I do. Oh, what's this thing?
[10.76s -> 25.27s]  The new exciting game in TF2.
[25.27s -> 29.50s]  Watch the saw blades in Sawmill.
[29.50s -> 34.30s]  You get one point for every person that walks directly into the saw.
[35.99s -> 37.43s]  There's one point already.
[38.55s -> 41.03s]  So I'm just going to sit here.
[41.59s -> 44.31s]  I'm going to sit here and just record this whole round, start to finish.
[44.87s -> 47.83s]  And we're going to see how many times people die on Sawmill to the blades.
[48.47s -> 49.83s]  Use the scientific method.
[49.83s -> 52.71s]  Roll up your sleeves, get out your safety goggles, because watch out.
[52.71s -> 56.39s]  We're going to see some type of chemical explosion from this experiment.
[56.39s -> 57.43s]  So get your flask ready.
[57.43s -> 58.71s]  Get your sodium fluoride ready.
[58.71s -> 59.91s]  We got a lot to talk about here.
[59.91s -> 60.63s]  Here we go.
[60.63s -> 62.89s]  This is the pyro.
[62.89s -> 63.77s]  Same guy.
[63.77s -> 64.73s]  Did the same thing.
[65.29s -> 65.85s]  That's one.
[66.82s -> 67.38s]  There's one.
[74.55s -> 75.51s]  Oh, there's two.
[76.94s -> 79.26s]  He didn't get his second double jump off in time.
[79.98s -> 85.19s]  This is like the most intense game of TF2 ever.
[86.15s -> 88.63s]  Just now, red is nearing capture.
[91.40s -> 92.36s]  Oh, blue scout.
[96.54s -> 98.38s]  That was like a photo finish right there.
[98.38s -> 101.50s]  I think that guy got hit by the saw, but he just didn't register.
[104.49s -> 106.33s]  One of these guys is definitely going to walk into it.
[106.33s -> 107.13s]  I would be shocked.
[115.40s -> 116.68s]  Okay, see, I told you.
[117.40s -> 120.52s]  I wonder if there's a way, like a server mod or something,
[120.52s -> 124.44s]  where you could have those saws go back and forth like a hundred miles per hour,
[124.44s -> 128.44s]  because there would be a hell of a lot more deaths if that was the case.
[128.44s -> 131.00s]  Well, scout, he wants the health pack.
[131.56s -> 132.20s]  Place your bets.
[133.00s -> 135.24s]  Didn't even have time to go to Vegas and place my bet.
[136.12s -> 137.91s]  Here's another skirmish.
[138.95s -> 141.35s]  When there's like three to four people standing on the point,
[141.35s -> 143.59s]  that's when you start to get the saw blade action.
[143.59s -> 146.63s]  Like for instance, I don't know what happened right there.
[146.63s -> 148.55s]  I'm not entirely sure what was happening.
[149.19s -> 151.11s]  I think, I think, I don't know.
[152.23s -> 153.67s]  He just wanted to go see his friends.
[154.63s -> 157.26s]  They have a sentry on here.
[157.26s -> 158.78s]  Red, you got to get that sentry off the point.
[159.75s -> 161.19s]  We need more saw deaths.
[162.38s -> 163.42s]  It is required.
[165.30s -> 166.58s]  It is a requirement.
[168.81s -> 171.77s]  We need more saw blade deaths.
[171.77s -> 172.73s]  This is not enough.
[176.31s -> 178.55s]  He just barely caught himself.
[179.64s -> 180.84s]  He still might walk into it.
[182.30s -> 184.38s]  It's definitely a high possibility at this point.
[193.05s -> 194.01s]  Oh, there it is.
[194.01s -> 195.13s]  There's another one.
[195.13s -> 195.61s]  See ya.
[196.25s -> 202.82s]  God, he got launched.
[203.38s -> 205.06s]  He got launched.
[207.24s -> 209.88s]  If red can hold this or blue needs to come take it.
[210.60s -> 213.64s]  Otherwise, wow, that was close.
[218.44s -> 219.48s]  Blue pyro coming in.
[221.56s -> 222.28s]  Bye bye.
[222.28s -> 222.92s]  There's another one.
[224.15s -> 227.43s]  Have a wonderful trip to saw blade hell.
[231.08s -> 232.92s]  Life will find a way.
[235.56s -> 245.70s]  Let's snipe her on it.
[247.82s -> 252.30s]  No, it's going to be blue team with a victory with I don't know how many saw deaths.
[252.30s -> 253.98s]  It was at least seven or eight.
[256.46s -> 257.98s]  I could seriously sit here all day.
[258.62s -> 264.14s]  I could sit here all day and do this and I probably will cancel all of my appointments
[264.14s -> 267.58s]  put everybody on hold because I don't really want to talk to them.
[267.66s -> 269.66s]  I want to watch people walk into saw blades.
[269.66s -> 270.70s]  That's like the number one.
[272.22s -> 273.66s]  That was almost that was pretty close.
[280.71s -> 281.19s]  All right.
[281.19s -> 285.56s]  And wait, wait till it wait till it comes until it comes back.
[286.36s -> 286.68s]  All right.
[286.68s -> 287.00s]  Ready?
[287.56s -> 289.80s]  Three, two, one, go.
[293.74s -> 294.78s]  It can't even do it.
[298.95s -> 299.83s]  It couldn't even do it.
[299.83s -> 301.27s]  It was getting stuck on people.
[304.49s -> 304.65s]  Yeah.
[304.65s -> 307.10s]  How are you doing that?
[307.10s -> 310.22s]  You are a master all dudes pile on top of him.
[310.22s -> 311.18s]  Somebody trying to get on his head.
[316.66s -> 317.62s]  Can that work?
[317.62s -> 318.74s]  Can that actually be a thing?
[318.74s -> 320.74s]  Can you guys like ride on top of each other's heads?
[321.54s -> 327.99s]  I love everyone trying to attempt to do this.
[327.99s -> 328.63s]  This is great.
[329.27s -> 340.76s]  It's not seem to be working.
[340.76s -> 342.12s]  It's not seem to be working.
[347.22s -> 348.90s]  Oh, we got to get above the waterfall.
[348.90s -> 349.38s]  That's key.
[349.38s -> 350.82s]  If we can get above the waterfall.
[357.24s -> 360.28s]  Oh, no, oh, no, it's over.
[361.72s -> 366.10s]  Oh, who toppled Jenga.
