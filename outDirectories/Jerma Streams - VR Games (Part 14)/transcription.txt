[2.74s -> 8.44s]  So I'm setting up VR. Let me tell you something about VR. I don't know why you would ever
[8.44s -> 13.80s]  fucking buy this. I don't know why you'd ever own one of these. It's a thing. Yeah, I'm kidding.
[15.32s -> 21.19s]  Start it off with a rant. Let me tell you something about VR. Should every VR stream
[21.19s -> 34.15s]  start with me being mad at VR? No, I'm fine. I'm good. The mic is quiet. Well, it's because,
[34.23s -> 39.96s]  hold on. It shouldn't be now because it was loud yesterday or the day before.
[41.00s -> 53.72s]  Hold on a second. Okay, I just don't want it to peak. Anyways, how you doing? Welcome to another
[53.72s -> 62.73s]  two to three hour VR stream. I have a bunch of games. We're gonna roll through them. At least
[62.73s -> 70.65s]  30 to 40 minutes in each one. I have two back to back here that I want to start with. What's that
[70.65s -> 81.37s]  thing behind you? What? Oh, let me just let me just grab a water. And we'll start in like
[81.37s -> 92.84s]  one and a half to two minutes. Be right back in a minute. Oh, the first game. Let me tell you.
[93.40s -> 100.98s]  The first game we're going to play is the arcade, the peer, peer arcade,
[102.09s -> 109.14s]  peer arcade two. I don't even know if the games I even have loaded here. It's like a VR arcade
[109.14s -> 241.05s]  simulator. It looked interesting. I'm gonna try it. I'll be right back. Okay. You guys ready?
[241.61s -> 261.98s]  That was five minutes. That was not five minutes. All right, let me get over here.
[261.98s -> 268.07s]  I did. I got a chair. So if I need to sit down, I can sit down if I have to.
[272.07s -> 289.85s]  All right, we get in here. Yes. All right. Can you can you guys hear it? All right,
[289.85s -> 302.30s]  the little low for me. Oh, so this game's got skeeball. It's got billiards. It's got,
[302.30s -> 310.71s]  I don't know, we're about to find out. What was the other one? Let me get my hand here.
[310.71s -> 322.57s]  Make sure I can see all of your lovely faces, which I can. Please. I have no idea what you said.
[323.93s -> 333.50s]  All I saw is please. Okay, this actually has index controls, which is actually pretty cool.
[333.50s -> 337.58s]  All right, press up and aim to teleport. Let me get hold on. My eyes are not in the right place.
[337.58s -> 343.24s]  Hope everybody's having a good day. Hope you're taking care of yourselves.
[343.80s -> 351.40s]  All right, here we go. It's a teleport game. That makes sense. That's okay. Why did you do
[351.40s -> 361.51s]  it? It's a VR game. Don't do that. This is virtual reality. You can't do that. Stop
[361.51s -> 372.06s]  jump scaring me. It's those need to come up very, very slowly. Wimp. But as if it's,
[372.06s -> 381.93s]  it's scary. All right, this is how you turn out a snap turn. Yeah. Okay. Sure. All right. All right,
[381.93s -> 388.07s]  I'm ready. Those got to come up if they're in the so this is my peripheral right here,
[388.07s -> 392.92s]  right? Can you do middle finger? Oh, you can. All right, cool. So this is my peripheral.
[394.70s -> 402.57s]  If this, this has to go like this fast. You can't in VR have to be like it's scared. It scares the
[402.57s -> 411.29s]  shit out of people. All right, how to grab and throw squeeze grip to grab and release to throw
[411.29s -> 421.78s]  squeeze. Okay. That's pretty fluid. That was fluid. I'll be honest. That was very fluid over here.
[421.78s -> 435.18s]  Can I do it with the other ones? Insert coins. Wait, what the hell is this? That's how you put
[435.18s -> 451.13s]  a coin in? Why is this? Why is there like a bomb in here? Oh shit. Really? How's the how's the how's
[451.13s -> 460.94s]  the audio? We good? How's the audio? I can't see so I need to know. It's good. It's good. It's all
[460.94s -> 468.15s]  right. It's good. It's good. Sounds good. Freddy Fazbear. All right. What about capitalism? I don't
[468.15s -> 476.50s]  know. I don't I don't want ambient sounds in my head. Should I smooth turn for you to help you
[476.50s -> 495.91s]  guys or is this all right? All right, single player. Is there story? Okay. It looks kind of
[495.91s -> 505.37s]  weird. Does it look weird for you? It looks kind of weird for me. What's this? How much money do I
[505.37s -> 512.79s]  have? Oh, shit. Are you kidding me? This is awesome. This is like coin game, but I get to actually do
[512.79s -> 528.55s]  it in real life. Well, in fake life. All right, let's try it. What do I do? Oh, what is this song?
[532.44s -> 553.08s]  Am I doing it right? I got it. I got one. Turn it. Turn turn. Okay, now come up. What? All right,
[553.08s -> 563.78s]  bring it down. Got one. This is too hard. This is way too hard. I'm just gonna leave this. I don't
[563.78s -> 567.22s]  care. I'm just leaving it. Some five year old will come and get a free life. I don't care.
[568.60s -> 571.64s]  Some some like 10 year old could go over there and get a free life.
[573.19s -> 580.87s]  Oh, I know this one. What do I do? I was gonna just fucking just load the goddamn thing up with
[580.87s -> 595.90s]  coins. You know what I mean? 26 credits. I'm gonna be here for a little while. Do I have money?
[596.46s -> 602.55s]  Where's my money? Do I have like a money indicator? He's a rich kid.
[604.34s -> 622.50s]  Instructions. Press the button to swing the crane arm. Okay, I didn't get any. All right,
[622.50s -> 634.17s]  there's like this like $30 in here. Right? Wait, am I trying to get it down here or over there?
[634.81s -> 662.81s]  Down here, right? No. There we go. That's five. I'll take it. Oh, there's coins. This like has
[662.81s -> 668.95s]  zero value to me right now. Do you know what I mean? If I know if I have 50 attempts and like
[668.95s -> 675.26s]  put like $100 in here or like $30 in here, there's no risk. There's no reward. Like I don't care.
[677.85s -> 692.62s]  There's no there's no stakes. I can just do this as many times as I want. Go harder. All right,
[692.62s -> 704.33s]  one more. I'm gonna get this hand over here. All right, some 10 year olds gonna be real happy
[704.33s -> 716.68s]  when they come over here. Like you're welcome. There's like $30 in there. Oh, I love this one.

[10544.26s -> 10584.87s]  like i'd rather just have it just do it by itself i just hit up get up here i don't need magic i'm
[10584.87s -> 10595.98s]  not a magic user i have a bow and arrow i'm a bow and arrow user but i think the game really
[10595.98s -> 10618.20s]  wants me to use magic where's my bow all right let's pick these guys off can you climb god i
[10618.20s -> 10632.55s]  feel like i'm playing pubg again there'd be a guy that had no fucking idea that i existed and he'd
[10632.55s -> 10637.48s]  be walking around picking up frying pans and looking out windows and i would just be missing
[10637.48s -> 10643.85s]  him over and over and over and over and over again and then finally this guy down here notices
[10643.85s -> 10650.25s]  that i'm shooting at him turns up and goes tap tap tap tap tap and i'm dead instantly like how

[12707.46s -> 12713.21s]  where we end it today and then the next stream uh i don't know how long the blair witch vr game is
[12713.21s -> 12719.35s]  but i'm gonna start with that and that will probably what's today because i have to have
[12719.35s -> 12727.45s]  enough time to make sure the big stream on the first is good to go so i'll probably what's
[12727.45s -> 12742.20s]  today the 23rd 24th 23 i will probably stream next on the 27th because then that'll give me
[12742.20s -> 12749.02s]  plenty of time to get the rest of the stuff ready for the first so we'll probably do cooking sim vr
[12750.46s -> 12761.80s]  blair witch vr and if i have time for one more maybe maybe among us vr would be a pretty pog day
[12762.60s -> 12770.39s]  but yeah let's let's get in this and see i'm back on thanks for sticking around by the way
[12771.03s -> 12784.41s]  kind of slowed down a little bit the tutorial there but i'm having a good time happy birthday
[12784.41s -> 12798.17s]  to that person whoever you are all right so this is a woodworking game wait can you guys hear is
[12798.17s -> 12823.08s]  this sound i don't know this sound is there sound no uh hold on okay choose wisely instructions
[12825.74s -> 12831.26s]  okay choose the board that corresponds to the board represented in the drawing place the chosen
[12831.26s -> 12839.26s]  board on the x ring the bell receive judgment contemplate your actions go to sleep sleeping
[12839.26s -> 12860.15s]  pills what do you mean sleeping pills why would i take sleeping pills what i didn't even make
[12860.15s -> 12878.09s]  anything i just took drugs and went to sleep all right choose wisely begin begin okay so i just
[12878.09s -> 12906.68s]  quit the game flipboard workshop guide okay where's that where's that chair all right workshop guide
[12910.95s -> 12916.31s]  movement decides using your feet you can teleport smoothly and rotate okay press and hold the
[12916.31s -> 12928.04s]  teleport button well i don't know what the teleport button is okay press and hold the
[12928.04s -> 12932.76s]  teleport button look direction present hold bulb left and right hand teleport buttons
[12932.76s -> 12941.66s]  okay what else you got tool belt use the tool belt to keep your tools and other items closely
[12942.58s -> 12949.32s]  switch interact near the belt buckle all the tool belt follows you around i just never could do i
[12949.32s -> 12953.69s]  could never do anything in school this wasn't gonna ever happen all right here's the wood
[12954.49s -> 12963.85s]  okay here's a piece of wood i see is there a dog auto what are you doing over here
[12966.14s -> 12987.69s]  dad daddy's working okay what are you supposed to do oh whoa it works what's that thing's name
[12987.69s -> 13001.46s]  from ed ed and eddie okay so i need to i got my tool belt here i need tools that's where i sleep
[13001.46s -> 13009.43s]  okay what do i need to make choose wisely materials total score i'm ready to submit in a second here
[13009.43s -> 13020.54s]  choose the board that course i'm gonna this is gonna follow the board represents what get back
[13020.54s -> 13028.86s]  in frame i'm coming that's a wall i'm coming i'm coming i'm coming okay so what the fuck am i
[13028.86s -> 13035.50s]  supposed to do all right so here's the thing that i need to grab this is the thing so this goes over
[13035.50s -> 13075.99s]  here choose the board and put it in the x i did it i didn't do anything is everyone supposed to do
[13078.46s -> 13092.12s]  complete okay uh now what one out of now how do i play welcome to the workshop begin a new project
[13092.60s -> 13116.79s]  what's going on change on the projector measure oh it's a tutorial ah okay oh instructions saw the
[13116.79s -> 13124.20s]  board to the correct length using the drawings as a reference submit for judgment okay so i gotta
[13124.20s -> 13134.76s]  take that piece of wood and i've got to saw it 24 inches long so it's gotta be 24 inches long you
[13134.76s -> 13156.42s]  got it 23 okay there needs to be so i have to saw it from here so i gotta saw it to that line
[13156.42s -> 13161.85s]  because that's like 20 that's like just about 23 inches so now i got a saw
[13166.06s -> 13177.51s]  that would be so scary grabbing it by the blade not a great idea by the way so how do i do this
[13177.51s -> 13217.78s]  how does this work holy shit i just did it this is fun okay so this is 24 inches long
[13217.78s -> 13252.55s]  get it on the x that's it right 63 percent how i thought it wanted to did i get it wrong
[13252.55s -> 13274.86s]  that doesn't make sense i did it wasn't good enough what do you mean 24 inches long how does
[13274.86s -> 13293.18s]  that make any sense 24 inches long oh a vice so what the hell use a pencil mark where 24 inches is
[13293.18s -> 13340.31s]  23 that's 24 right here that's literally 24 inches that's off of the table okay that's 23
[13340.31s -> 13374.12s]  no it ain't 23 24 yeah i had it right what is that all right i got it 89 what's next make the cut
[13374.12s -> 13387.56s]  oh this one's gonna be fun please use the tape measure okay what do we got saw the board to the
[13387.56s -> 13392.94s]  correct length using the drawing as a reference submit for judgment sleep tight okay but to make
[13392.94s -> 13454.07s]  a cube that's easy that's easy okay that's i made a cube that's it it's a cube a cube is a cube
[13454.07s -> 13471.13s]  hold on that was a shit cube you cut it diagonally no i didn't maybe a little but what does it matter
[13471.13s -> 13497.54s]  can i do it again oh shit it is diagonal all right i had to get a this is the wrong way stop
[13523.70s -> 13532.54s]  this one's worse i think you need to measure i don't like oh i don't like measuring i don't care
[13532.54s -> 13540.65s]  who needs to measure all right get out of this chair i'm gonna fall down if this chair keeps
[13540.65s -> 13545.45s]  getting in the way all right fine i'll measure it i'll do the stupid thing we go like this
[13548.17s -> 13556.12s]  okay look sure here we go here's your edge here we go take a look here is it gonna be a perfect
[13556.12s -> 13573.72s]  line wait how does it this doesn't matter if i draw a line it doesn't matter what if i go like
[13573.72s -> 13596.17s]  this i don't get it read it this is i can't do this it's impossible measure how i've never taken
[13596.17s -> 13610.28s]  a woodworking class please he doesn't know what i don't understand i don't know what to do no shit
[13610.28s -> 13618.26s]  it's just geometry the last time i was in a geometry class class bill clinton was the president
[13618.26s -> 13638.94s]  okay i don't remember anything from that class i don't know anything from that class all sides
[13639.02s -> 13670.10s]  are equal oh i see what you mean by that it's perfect goddamn cube if i ever seen one what
[13670.10s -> 13699.48s]  happened here i wonder if it's gonna be fucking right i'll tell you that the teacher doesn't even
[13699.48s -> 13719.80s]  check anyways you go up there with a cube and they go yep that's that's a cube all right that's a
[13719.80s -> 13749.56s]  passing grade i'll take a see whack whack he's pretending he has to be pretending oh wait nail
[13749.56s -> 13765.48s]  the two boards together oh this is gonna be fun okay does it i don't doesn't matter how do i have
[13765.48s -> 13821.90s]  to do anything weird pick up the whole thing what the fuck okay that's pretty nice like little lip
[13821.90s -> 13831.46s]  for the shelf it didn't say i had to just it just said nail them together yeah i mean nail them
[13831.46s -> 13872.70s]  together that's it you're a caveman 240 this i like this game a lot this is fun 24 inches long
[13872.70s -> 13893.77s]  they both are 24 inches long okay 24 inches long what if i just double them up that saves a bunch
[13893.77s -> 13936.70s]  of shit a lot of time right the 24 inches long tape measure 25 24 25 20 i need the pencil 24 25
[13936.70s -> 13970.15s]  25 okay i was saw if you picked up a tape measure you're reading centimeters what no what are you
[13970.15s -> 14007.98s]  talking about why am i in the way okay get right there oh okay now they got these perfect now they
[14008.06s -> 14022.63s]  have to be this has to be put on here like this i have to put this in the in the vice again what
[14022.63s -> 14040.52s]  am i what am i making okay so this goes in here cool then how do i glue i have to glue this where's
[14040.52s -> 14068.87s]  the wood glue finishing nails common nails do i have to glue this there are grips under the table
[14068.87s -> 14106.41s]  oh i think this is okay that's good that should be at least a b i don't even need a tape measure
[14106.41s -> 14176.74s]  look at that perfect that go in yeah it's in this is solid one maybe like one more i think
[14176.74s -> 14195.78s]  that should be good that's solid that's solid that's it that's solid that's a that's going to
[14195.78s -> 14206.76s]  be at least a 70 or 80 that's definitely going to be good that's a 98 percent all by the way i need
[14206.76s -> 14229.19s]  a tape measure you sure almost almost 100 percent all right well now what stool sample i have to
[14229.19s -> 14245.94s]  make a table now oh boy this is going to get weird okay what is it i have to use bread 18 everything
[14245.94s -> 14283.10s]  is it's an 18 inch long table 18 inches so the whole thing is 18 inches 18 what is all that
[14283.10s -> 14306.30s]  what i only have two pieces of wood 18 inches long and then these are 10 inches long so i need two of
[14306.30s -> 14336.20s]  these two 18 inches is this whole thing to double 18 what is the measure how long is this whole thing
[14336.20s -> 14372.33s]  stop this is like 27 47 this is like 47 inches long what's 18 plus 18 oh 36 so i need two pieces
[14376.98s -> 14395.37s]  two pieces two 18 pieces of this one right no of that one um two 18s of this right next to each
[14395.37s -> 14416.54s]  other or two 18s of that right next to each other this one that one the bread get back in frame i
[14416.54s -> 14430.82s]  hold on the narrow one is 18 so 18 twice but then what about this one is this the back i these like
[14430.82s -> 14438.63s]  i'm sorry but these like little dumb ikea drawings they're not that clear what what is this
[14439.64s -> 14448.47s]  what am i looking at here what what am i looking at these are not instructions these are caveman
[14448.47s -> 14455.50s]  paintings this is the caveman painting instructions i i can't decipher with that what the what they
[14455.50s -> 14470.65s]  want me to do the width of the whole thing is 18 but there are two see one two cut but this 10
[14471.21s -> 14503.88s]  what's that the width of the whole thing oh the bread's so crusty listen to this when it comes
[14503.88s -> 14516.62s]  out of the oven you can just hear crunch of the bread do you need a hand saw to cut through a
[14516.62s -> 14528.97s]  piece of fucking bread that would be the toughest most disgusting bread ever all right i don't get
[14528.97s -> 14534.92s]  it i don't get it i'm not i don't really work with my hands i'm more of an idea guy you know
[14535.64s -> 14548.98s]  i'm more of an ideas guy this one needs that one needs to be two pieces of 18 hammer a nail
[14548.98s -> 14555.78s]  into the bread i love how you guys are giving me tasks that you know that i'm capable of doing
[14556.42s -> 14562.60s]  like i'm like the i'm like the weirdo that just comes here and does this oh yes i hammer a nail
[14562.60s -> 14579.21s]  into bread that sounds easy i do that right here oh hey look what i did daddy no i don't want to
[14579.53s -> 14584.73s]  bite into this what if somebody bites into this they hit the nail hold on let's as you see we had
[14584.73s -> 14594.07s]  that flavor injector and add look at that look at the peppercorn we put in there is it gonna cut
[14594.07s -> 14607.19s]  through the nail one peppercorn one peppercorn in the whole piece of bread all right i need to
[14607.19s -> 14616.74s]  help somebody get somebody help me just help me nobody does this shit alone anyways are you serious
[14617.94s -> 14624.50s]  who does this shit alone you like have three people all looking fanning through the instructions
[14624.50s -> 14634.55s]  i don't know dude what do we even have those nails be my person that's here helping me
[14634.55s -> 14635.67s]  make a sandwich with wood
[14648.20s -> 14661.51s]  i can't i can't that's what i'm capable of doing oh okay fine oh there's mold on it okay
[14661.67s -> 14669.90s]  okay okay i'm gonna slice the bread real thick oh yes absolutely delicious thinly crusty slice
[14669.90s -> 14698.65s]  bread no that's too thick just make a i'm gonna make a sandwich with nails get off of me oh this
[14698.65s -> 14706.09s]  is so dumb i want to make kind of okay what if i just make my own thing can i make like a chair
[14706.09s -> 14719.05s]  out of this stuff should i just dump the whole bag of nails in here nail it to the calculator
[14721.21s -> 14726.57s]  can i even do that no wait let me just give me a minute i need at least two pieces of bread
[14726.57s -> 14737.91s]  what happened to the saw wait this paint what this game is so cool why can i be smart enough
[14737.91s -> 14759.86s]  to enjoy it fresh mayo or ranch doesn't matter coat it each and every pore it really will absorb
[14759.86s -> 14781.18s]  the tuna okay where's the saw is there any mustard i don't we only have white paint right now
[14781.18s -> 14798.36s]  we only have white paint god damn it dude this whole stream has just been like do the weird thing
[14798.36s -> 14828.92s]  today can i just dump it over okay where's the wood what happened to the saw okay give me a nice
[14828.92s -> 14892.36s]  slice of this a nice thick wood burger okay we're gonna do a double a double patty need another
[14892.36s -> 14924.89s]  piece of bread top it off with some nails and let's get another piece of nice thick cut bread
[14924.89s -> 14933.85s]  all right what if you walked into dad's workshop and he was doing this what would you do would you
[14933.85s -> 14944.86s]  be like dad what the fuck are you doing dad like what's okay i can't have the nails on it actually
[14944.86s -> 14985.03s]  went through it actually worked and who could get the mayo it looks like it's lined up okay
[14985.03s -> 15006.04s]  all right that's done and then somebody said nail it to the calculator submit this all right if it's
[15006.04s -> 15026.71s]  more than five percent i win that's how this is gonna work holy shit what 24 percent okay what am
[15026.71s -> 15030.68s]  i supposed to actually i'm skipping this one i don't get it i don't get the caveman drawings
[15030.68s -> 15044.42s]  i'm just taking my i'm taking pills and going i don't get it i have to beat it shit all right
[15044.42s -> 15056.79s]  give me some help just give me just help me just give me some help which is tell me where to start
[15056.79s -> 15079.02s]  first go to sandbox mode what are you kidding me begin load backup quit where's sandbox mode
[15079.02s -> 15104.50s]  nail a board to your forehead cycle through the entire projector this is a million slots
[15104.50s -> 15122.60s]  free play all right what do you want to make what do you guys want to make build a sailboat a house
[15122.60s -> 15140.60s]  all right i'll build a um a rocking chair chair i'll try a chair i don't i don't i'm gonna just
[15140.60s -> 15160.60s]  give me one of everything like how do i get more than one okay i'll make a chair why are they all
[15160.60s -> 15179.29s]  the same size okay all right that should be enough to make a chair i need a few of these all right
[15179.29s -> 15196.44s]  let's go i'm ready what does a chair look like chair there's a seat we're gonna have to probably
[15196.44s -> 15209.16s]  double it up or triple it up so let's go like this there's a seat obviously oh look i have a reference
[15209.16s -> 15230.82s]  right here okay there's a seat i'm gonna i'm gonna like double or triple this up by the way
[15230.82s -> 15238.06s]  i don't need to measure because if you see what i'm doing here just eyeballing it i'm gonna double
[15238.06s -> 15263.64s]  it up okay so you triple it up you think it'd be a big seat i'll make sure the seat be i don't think
[15263.64s -> 15324.82s]  it should be that thick easy stop do i how i need some bigger nails now that's way too thick all
[15324.82s -> 15336.04s]  right so this is gonna be the back of the chair like this i need a glue or something options table
[15336.04s -> 15341.94s]  of contents okay no no i need materials that scared the shit out of me that was like a jump
[15342.58s -> 15358.04s]  okay give me this give me these so first thing is first this is the seat so the seat's gonna be
[15358.04s -> 15367.77s]  two double patties try to get it flush if i can it's two double patties on top of each other
[15367.77s -> 15375.82s]  like that doesn't have to be perfect close enough i can and i can just i can shave off the edges too
[15375.82s -> 15398.62s]  i can shave off the shit that it doesn't make sense once it's nailed i can shave it oh shit
[15398.62s -> 15415.02s]  it's all right no no no it's okay it's okay that i need a leg um all right this can be a leg
[15415.02s -> 15424.39s]  leg should probably be pretty not huge but all enough i need four of these they have to be
[15424.39s -> 15447.86s]  relatively the same size i'm gonna say like here because then that'll be is that that's okay that's
[15447.86s -> 15479.02s]  that's kind of weirdly huge okay hold on i need to keep this still just make it the same length
[15479.02s -> 15505.59s]  it's kind of huge just give me okay come here i'll do two at a time do you guys know they make wood
[15505.59s -> 15513.21s]  i just found this out literally like three days ago so they like squish it together they like spin
[15513.21s -> 15519.22s]  it and have this long they take a tree trunk and they essentially shave it and they shave shave
[15519.22s -> 15524.90s]  shave shave shave shave shave and then they like wet it and like press it together it's it's weird
[15524.90s -> 15536.41s]  how they do it plywood yeah they spin the trunk and shave thinly these like puff pastry pieces
[15536.41s -> 15543.19s]  of the wood and then they like wet it and like squish it together it's weird how they do plywood
[15543.19s -> 15553.21s]  yeah no way dude yeah no seriously it's weird you're not using plywood yeah but i'm just saying it
[15553.45s -> 15570.92s]  i didn't know that but we can't learn things here together ban everybody oh wait that's perfect
[15570.92s -> 15594.62s]  that's actually not a bad thing one two three okay let's get this at least hammered in here
[15594.62s -> 15614.17s]  hold on i just like pressed a button on my keyboard i have no idea what i just did
[15614.17s -> 15649.34s]  um i have to get it in there first shit i feel like this is a chevy chase movie i i feel like
[15649.34s -> 15681.40s]  i'm not even that's so dangerous that's so dangerous that's so awful so he's gonna get hurt
[15681.40s -> 15694.31s]  okay whatever it just has to work so that's that do this now at least i have one leg
[15694.31s -> 15705.00s]  don't make a mistake this time okay let me put this over here get it started but don't go all
[15705.00s -> 15774.04s]  the way okay no more yes okay pretty much halfway there how do you um never mind i need one i need
[15774.04s -> 15788.15s]  another person to hold this you know what i mean somebody else has to hold on to this oh no what
[15788.15s -> 15848.76s]  do i do how do i do this vice stop relax bingo check that out oh god where am i going all right
[15848.76s -> 15875.11s]  all right not bad not bad okay shit it's okay it's okay it doesn't look awful i'm almost i've pretty
[15875.11s -> 15884.62s]  much got it where i want it but not really though just everybody relax what was the piece of this
[15884.62s -> 15896.60s]  is it right here i need a long piece for the back this is too long i gotta cut this i gotta
[15896.60s -> 15917.96s]  market with a pencil whiz pencil okay i think my pants are falling off this is like you know
[15917.96s -> 15922.52s]  those services that are at like home depot it's like oh we can get a professional in there and
