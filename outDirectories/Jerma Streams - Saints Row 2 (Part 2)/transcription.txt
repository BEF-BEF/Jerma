[5.11s -> 15.45s]  Hey guys, how are you? Resident sleeper. Resident sleeper. I'm so highly trying to get up. I'm
[15.45s -> 23.46s]  trying to wake up. You know when you're like, yeah. And you do like, with aftershave. In fact,
[23.46s -> 32.50s]  I did that already. Didn't work. You know what I'm talking about? You put aftershave in your hands,
[32.50s -> 39.56s]  and you rub it together, and you go. Nobody has ever done that before. It's in every movie,
[39.56s -> 46.76s]  with like a kid that learns how to shave. That doesn't happen. I didn't even use aftershave,
[47.32s -> 58.26s]  until I was like 30. Anyways. Hi, how are you? How you doing? Hold on, let me move this for a
[58.26s -> 74.81s]  second. Somebody just said, okay, buddy. Okay, buddy. Why is my mic in the wrong spot every time?
[74.81s -> 96.92s]  I don't understand. Hold on, let me move this. Okay. I got my controller. I'm ready to go. Sorry,
[96.92s -> 104.86s]  I am about 40 minutes late. I woke up 55 minutes ago. I was up all night last night,
[106.46s -> 113.70s]  for a bunch of different reasons. I've been very, very excited. Maybe, if I'm honest,
[113.70s -> 122.36s]  maybe a little overwhelmed by some things. Don't call me a 3k, Andy. Just wait 10 minutes. Sorry,
[122.36s -> 126.68s]  like when people talk about my low view count, it automatically just triggers a fucking rage
[126.68s -> 137.96s]  response. Sorry, let's continue. Yeah, I was up all night last night and I'll be real with you.
[140.87s -> 146.63s]  There's a lot going on. God damn it. I'm trying to be real and I do a fucking voice crack and
[146.63s -> 157.43s]  everyone's gonna laugh at it. Without getting into details, there's a lot of stuff going on
[157.43s -> 164.14s]  behind the scenes in my life right now. All very, very wonderful things. Wonderful things.
[165.94s -> 171.22s]  Not, I'm not talking about just, oh, he's talking about like projects. There's a lot of great things
[171.22s -> 180.25s]  going on. Some that I'll talk about soon, probably. But I'm getting, I'm getting kind
[180.25s -> 185.54s]  of overwhelmed. There's so many fucking cool things. And then I get up yesterday, or the day
[185.54s -> 190.98s]  before, and I see that I'm like on the front page of all of Reddit with like 50,000 uploads,
[190.98s -> 198.90s]  the serial killer image. And like everybody thinks of a serial killer. And I gotta tell you,
[199.86s -> 207.61s]  I gotta be careful with my next wish from the chat genie. Because, oh please, please, please,
[207.61s -> 211.93s]  oh please, oh chat genie, please make the stupid face go away that I don't like.
[213.32s -> 218.36s]  The monkey pot curls, there it is. There's the among us face, right? Oh please, please chat genie,
[218.36s -> 224.28s]  please make the among us face go away. I don't like the sus guy. Okay, fine. You're every serial
[224.28s -> 232.17s]  killer that's ever been combined together in an AI image. I am, I am not gonna use my third chat
[232.17s -> 238.73s]  genie wish on anything else. And I thought about this in the shower. I was like, you know, all
[238.73s -> 245.26s]  right, what if I like wish for world like hunger to be over, right? Somehow the monkey pot would
[245.26s -> 252.52s]  curl. And so we would all fucking die. And like the aliens would come get us, like and eat our
[252.52s -> 257.16s]  like fucking the soil in the ground. I'm not making any more fucking wishes. Never again.
[260.44s -> 264.28s]  Like aliens would find this planet a million years from now and the soil would be fucking so
[264.28s -> 280.73s]  good. It would solve their alien world hunger. Nope. No more wishes. Zero. What was he talking
[280.73s -> 291.05s]  about? I'm talking about serial killer AI image. I was on the toilet. I'm not, I was taking a
[291.05s -> 295.94s]  going to the bathroom on the second number and I'm scrolling down. I didn't know it was there.
[296.74s -> 301.90s]  It's the second time it was there in the month. I'm sitting there. I'm going to the bathroom. I'm
[301.90s -> 307.98s]  scrolling down and I just see my like, my like arrest picture. It has like 30 something thousand
[307.98s -> 320.62s]  upvotes on the front page. I audibly gasped. It was like, that's how I found out it was there.
[321.26s -> 337.03s]  I'm not wishing for anything else. Never again. Never again. This guy's ego is out of hand.
[339.61s -> 342.33s]  No more wishes. I'm never asking for anything ever again.
[347.13s -> 363.43s]  Why did you wish to be a serial killer? I didn't. Yes, you did. I know I didn't. What are you
[363.43s -> 378.97s]  talking about? You just wished for the sus face to come back. No, I did not. Do you wish to be sus?
[381.93s -> 385.45s]  And I don't know, weirdly enough, me saying this, me like talking about this and being like,
[385.45s -> 390.62s]  holy shit, I don't know if I like that one. So it's, there's going to be like a combination.
[390.62s -> 400.20s]  Nope. Don't say it. Don't say it. I'm not going to, I'm done. All right. Let's play Saints Row 2.
[400.20s -> 414.12s]  Hi guys. Welcome to the stream. Nope. No. Okay. Saints Row 2 coming up here. We're going to go
[414.12s -> 419.99s]  right where we left off, which should be, I don't know what we like 5% of the way through the game.
[419.99s -> 436.63s]  Does it matter which one we pick? Probably this one, right? Yeah. But it's, it's been, it's been a
[436.63s -> 446.33s]  while, a few weeks, few months. I'm very, very excited. I can't wait for all this stuff. I've
[446.33s -> 451.56s]  been, I was up all night. I couldn't go to sleep. I forgot this is what the character looked like.
[452.12s -> 463.59s]  All right. What are the buttons again? All right. Oh shit. Okay. So we do a mission. No, let me,
[463.59s -> 475.18s]  let me get, let me get my bearings. Hold on. Let's sprint. Let's throw. Okay.
[484.28s -> 491.82s]  What are you saying? Hold on. Somebody, somebody wrote something. They were very concerned about
[491.82s -> 497.24s]  me. Hold on. Remember what started out as a joke has escalated over the last few weeks
[497.24s -> 501.48s]  of something concerning. A friend of mine began watching you at a friend's recommendation sheet.
[501.48s -> 512.30s]  All right. I'm not gonna, nevermind. Oh, did the game crash? No, it didn't. Webcam or naked?
[512.30s -> 531.59s]  The second one. I didn't mean to shoot. All right. Let's go to, I forgot how fun this game was.
[540.20s -> 551.30s]  A welcome to the stream, everybody. I've got my coffee here. Let me take a sip. All right. So
[552.10s -> 563.94s]  let's take a look at the map. I could do this Ronan mission. I could go get some food. Oh,
[563.94s -> 578.47s]  15% off sale. Let's go. You know when you get up and you realize that you're supposed to be somewhere
[580.79s -> 584.07s]  and you have, your body's in slow motion, your brain is in slow motion too.
[587.34s -> 599.24s]  And you always wake up and you go, ah, everybody does that. Ah, and then you have to like close
[599.24s -> 615.38s]  one eye and like blink them a bunch of times because your eyes aren't ready. Yeah, that happened.
[616.10s -> 623.27s]  All right. What we got? Put the gun away, please. Put the gun away. Whoa, wait a minute. Once you
[623.27s -> 628.07s]  own a hood, you can buy a share of each business in that hood. Owning a share of the business will
[628.07s -> 638.41s]  give you a discount on their items. I can own this place? 5,000 bucks. Did I get it? I got it.
[639.05s -> 645.70s]  You now get a piece of the action of the store and we'll see $200 a day.
[646.94s -> 651.56s]  What the fuck is this guy doing? I'm in the middle of a cut scene, dude. Leave me alone.
[652.28s -> 677.88s]  They're coming back. No, they're not. Okay, so what is happening out here? Why am I this person now?
[677.88s -> 694.98s]  I just became this person. What? What's going on? Okay, I got absorbed. So I get a discount here
[694.98s -> 705.69s]  now. Yeah, we need some new clothes for sure. I gotta not be the Happy Wheels character. All right,
[705.69s -> 736.95s]  hats. What do we got? How about the 3D movie maker hat? Okay, I like these. Okay, shirts. Nothing
[736.95s -> 744.42s]  looks correct on this character. Why is it screaming outside? What the fuck is happening?
[748.49s -> 772.68s]  That one just looks like skin. Okay, over shirts. Coats. Denim vest. Fear and loathing in McDonald's.
[772.68s -> 784.60s]  That's pretty good. Get the swords. Does it come with the swords? You're just a tent.
[786.28s -> 818.89s]  What about lower? I need different pants. God. Why am I- whatever. Why am I T-posing? What the fuck?
[819.77s -> 824.26s]  Shit, I forgot about that. Somebody said the outfits crash the game no matter what.
[824.26s -> 831.75s]  I- whatever. I gotta go buy that place again. Fuck, come on. All right, I'm never touching
[831.75s -> 836.55s]  outfits. I forgot about that. If you touch- if you look at an outfit, if an outfit gets previewed,
[836.55s -> 857.00s]  it crashes the game every single time no matter what. Okay. Well, should I- maybe should I save
[857.00s -> 867.56s]  my money? Or should I not buy that place? A bunch of people saying go to the mall. Where's the mall?
[867.56s -> 880.86s]  Up here? All right, there's a mission over here, which I'll do that. It says mall on the map. It
[880.86s -> 892.86s]  does. I end retail district. Boardwalk. The beach. No, I'm not going to the casino right now. No.
[892.86s -> 903.32s]  It says mall. Yeah, but I- okay. Yeah, it says mall, but it's covered up by like a flag. There it is.
[903.32s -> 916.89s]  Okay, mall. Go that way. You can take a motorcycle into the mall. Oh shit, we're definitely doing
[916.89s -> 930.30s]  that. There's a funny costume store? Okay. I think I'm gonna take like the hamburger mobile.
[930.30s -> 959.06s]  Does this do- can I like- no, it just looks cool. Oh, it- oh, dude, Rick. All right, going to the mall.
[959.94s -> 963.22s]  And then I'm gonna- after that, I'm gonna do the Ronin mission that's right there, because everyone
[963.22s -> 980.71s]  said do the Ronin missions. They're the best. A crush lizard. Thanks for the 20 community subs.
[980.71s -> 1002.31s]  Would you eat a hamburger with a fork? No. I'm not- I'm not a twisted, twisted fuck. What about pizza?
[1002.31s -> 1014.22s]  Depends on the kind of pizza. A really sloppy soup pizza? Yeah, maybe. Sometimes you have to. All
[1014.22s -> 1023.54s]  right, so this is mall? Cool. All right, so what's- where's the mall? What's this? Enter the
[1023.54s -> 1038.20s]  Altord Depot shopping mall. Oh shit, okay. So we're in- now here we are. I was watching.
[1038.84s -> 1042.28s]  What was the problem? What was the matter? I was watching him do that. Okay, that was-
[1042.28s -> 1051.99s]  that was aggressive. It was. I'm not gonna- that was aggressive. I bumped him. Wait, this roller
[1051.99s -> 1066.73s]  skating? How come I can't- I have roller skates on right now. Can I do that? Oh, cool. Mall is- oh,
[1066.73s -> 1072.28s]  I almost just took that lady out. All right, so where's the- oh, there we go. I want to go over
[1072.28s -> 1078.86s]  there. So we gotta go take a right. Go down this way. It's over there. Does this hurt if I do this?
[1078.86s -> 1098.39s]  Can I jump over this? The auto show? Cool. Yeah, all right, so we gotta go across. There are three
[1098.39s -> 1111.48s]  stores in the mall that sell unique clothes. Oh, cool. I always feel weird when I do this in a mall.
[1111.48s -> 1118.98s]  Anybody else relate to this? Sitting down in one of these benches and one of these sofas at the mall
[1118.98s -> 1122.58s]  it almost to me internally feels like I'm not supposed to be here. I'm not supposed to be in
[1122.58s -> 1128.12s]  the mall. I don't know why I have this thing in my brain where like if you're at a mall you need to
[1128.12s -> 1131.48s]  be walking around and like shopping and looking at stuff. I feel like sitting down it's almost
[1131.48s -> 1139.59s]  like what am I- why am I here? It feels weird. I feel like people are walking by and judging me.
[1139.59s -> 1145.21s]  Like, you're not buying anything. You're just sitting down in the bench and the only way that
[1145.21s -> 1150.50s]  you get a pass doing that is if you're holding an ice cream. Oh, okay, you've got an ice cream.
[1150.50s -> 1154.15s]  You're shopping here, aren't you? You're like hanging- okay, you've got an ice cream. You're
[1154.15s -> 1167.77s]  fine. I don't know why I feel like that. Oh, like a pretzel. Yeah. Oh, like you- oh, you've got a big
[1167.77s -> 1183.30s]  pretzel. I do not go to outfits with the love of god. You're nuts. Okay, what do we got? The bike
[1183.30s -> 1198.63s]  helmet, the cap, dirt bike helmet. Why does this have a respirator? Should I get that one with a
[1198.63s -> 1216.07s]  respirator? I want to be able to see his face though. I like- I like his- I want to see his face.
[1216.07s -> 1234.41s]  I want this one. Solid silk shirt. Oh, okay. Wait, maybe. I'll come back to it. Oh, these swishy
[1234.41s -> 1246.20s]  pants? I loved swishy pants when I was younger. Guys, every single middle school in America,
[1246.20s -> 1251.08s]  if you just sit there and listen in the hallway, it just sounds like this.
[1255.62s -> 1274.57s]  All the fucking kids walking around with these swishy pants on. I kind of want the blood vial.
[1274.57s -> 1284.34s]  You can't even see it. I'm too big. I forget without the hat. I gotta take the hat off.
[1284.34s -> 1291.10s]  It's so much better without the hat on. It's so much better. A million times better.
[1298.02s -> 1306.95s]  I have to take- that just hurt. Okay, hold on. I take off the hat. How do I take- how do I get no
[1306.95s -> 1318.66s]  hat? Can I? I think I have to go to my wardrobe, right? Don't touch outfits. How do I skip outfits?
[1318.66s -> 1334.41s]  Okay, miscellaneous. Wallet chain? No. No tattoos. No, all right. Let's get out of here.
[1334.41s -> 1347.34s]  Do suits count as outfits? I'm terrified to go look at it. I think so, yeah. No. Hmm. Suits
[1347.34s -> 1361.70s]  are fine. Are you sure? Yes, they do. All right, where else can we go? Over here. I want to go
[1361.70s -> 1378.33s]  this way. We gotta go downstairs. That'd be so fucked up if you saw that. Is it all the way
[1378.33s -> 1395.78s]  down or is it just right here? Wait, is this a weapons store, Hoover? This is a weapons store.
[1395.78s -> 1404.79s]  I had to get it out of my system by punching the air first. Whoa, there's different stuff in here.
[1404.79s -> 1413.14s]  Oh, shit. All right, here we go. What do you got? I already have that. SMGs, shotguns, rifles,
[1413.14s -> 1431.91s]  special, throne. No, you don't have anything new. Get out of here. What the fuck? What? Increase
[1431.91s -> 1443.30s]  elevation. Decrease elevation. Rotate the helicopter. Why am I in this? Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out!
[1443.30s -> 1461.13s]  Get out! I'm trapped! I'm trapped! Holy shit, you don't even care. Can I flip it? I can't flip it.
[1461.13s -> 1474.38s]  No, it's over. I've ruined it. No, I ruined it. What the hell? Whatever. That's why you wanted me
[1474.38s -> 1479.42s]  to come here and it's been like 10 straight minutes of buildup of you telling me to go to the mall
[1479.42s -> 1493.21s]  for me to flip it in less than two seconds. Just reload the save. What? What did you say? Who said
[1493.21s -> 1504.26s]  that? I want to see what the other store is though. I can't reload. It's not even gonna put me in the
[1504.26s -> 1520.97s]  mall. You guys are shit crazy. Watch this. More can spawn. Okay, cool. Okay, I'll just come back.
[1520.97s -> 1533.61s]  Reload the gun, not the save. Wait, I'm going the wrong way. Where is this place? Down here. Okay.
[1533.61s -> 1548.12s]  Why am I so- I'm so out of breath every second. Hurry up. I watched Ernest's Scared Stupid and
[1548.12s -> 1554.30s]  it sucked. Get out of here. You don't even know anything about movies. What do you know about
[1554.30s -> 1569.72s]  movies? All right, I'm sorry. Ernest- the Ernest franchise is better than the entire phase four of
[1569.72s -> 1583.93s]  Marvel. I'm just gonna be honest. What happened? What? Like the Ernest cinematic universe phase
[1583.93s -> 1587.96s]  one I think is better than the Marvel cinematic universe phase four. I think- I think that's not
[1587.96s -> 1601.37s]  like an unpopular opinion. How do I get rid of this guy? Oh, I'm on the wrong side.
[1601.37s -> 1614.47s]  All right, just beat this guy up. Doesn't everybody care that I did this? I don't think so. All right,
[1614.47s -> 1640.84s]  hurry up. Let's go. The Eternals Scared Stupid. What do you think is gonna happen with Marvel?
[1640.84s -> 1656.04s]  Do you think there's gonna be a phase five? Like phase six? I don't know. I wonder. Oh my god. I
[1656.04s -> 1681.53s]  don't want to go too fast. I don't want to attract attention. I don't want to attract attention so I
[1681.53s -> 1701.50s]  gotta go slow. Oops. Okay, this way. How are you still alive? I just hit you with a fucking sludge
[1701.50s -> 1706.57s]  hammer. What? No, I don't want to shoot- I didn't even shoot him. The game did that on its own.
[1707.13s -> 1711.21s]  The game, I swear to god, did that on its own. I didn't press any buttons. I didn't- that was
[1711.21s -> 1722.23s]  his decision, not mine. I didn't press that. I swear to god. I didn't press anything. A chainsaw?
[1722.23s -> 1729.80s]  Oh my goodness gracious. All right, I'm sorry but how do you advertise a chainsaw but not have it
[1729.80s -> 1752.78s]  in st- in- in- in store? Where's the chainsaw? Look at the- you have so many in stock. What the
[1752.78s -> 1766.86s]  fuck? How do you not- get away from me. How do you not have that in stock? That's annoying.
[1766.86s -> 1775.53s]  I didn't even steal anything. Why did that alarm go off? I didn't take anything out of the store.
[1777.29s -> 1800.01s]  What the fuck is that thing? I'm so sorry I didn't mean to. So stupid. Take the AT- I want the UFO.
[1800.01s -> 1810.62s]  Is it back- is it spawned again? I'll take- I'll take a couple of donut holes. I'll take- I'll take a
[1810.62s -> 1834.68s]  donut. How do I get out of this without a problem? Get out. Leave me alone. Give me one of the little
[1834.68s -> 1841.30s]  security wagons. What are you doing? Get in the security wagon. It's smaller. It's tighter. It's
[1841.30s -> 1846.02s]  easy- it's like easier to like maneuver. You got tighter handling. Stop! Oh my god. I'm gonna fucking
[1846.02s -> 1864.50s]  flip out. I'm sorry. I'm gonna- leave me alone. All right, I went to the mall and then nothing
[1864.50s -> 1881.99s]  happened. I just wasted 20 minutes. I want to do a mission. Go back please. Wait, can I take the UFO
[1881.99s -> 1897.16s]  out of the mall? Oh this is- Misty Lane is under attack. What? What do you mean it's under attack?
[1897.16s -> 1902.97s]  By who? Oh my god. Wait a minute. This must- I think this might be an Avengers level threat.
[1902.97s -> 1917.46s]  I gotta go protect- I gotta go protect my home. I want to play the Avengers theme song,
[1917.46s -> 1930.78s]  but I feel like that would be like- I would- they'd come after me somehow. Play the Ernest theme song.
[1931.34s -> 1939.61s]  I don't think he even had a- I don't think he had a theme song. Hey Vern, I'm coming
[1939.61s -> 1948.18s]  Ernest B Warl to save everybody down here. Now Vern, I have a sledgehammer. I'm gonna cock it back
[1948.18s -> 1966.68s]  behind my back and swing where the fences burn. This is an Ernest level threat. Oh shit,
[1966.68s -> 1977.43s]  we've got an Ernest level threat here. That's so stupid. During a pushback, an enemy gang is trying
[1977.43s -> 1984.78s]  to reclaim their neighborhood. Contested neighborhood will be flashing on the city map.
[1984.78s -> 1988.14s]  Okay. In order to retake the contested area, you must enter the neighborhood and kill the
[1988.14s -> 1992.70s]  enemy lieutenants. Until you do, you- you will earn no money for controlling that neighborhood.
[1992.70s -> 2012.20s]  Oh shit, that's actually a big deal. All right, I gotta- I gotta do this. Oh no, what about the
[2012.20s -> 2022.66s]  caterers? Hey Vern, this car- I can't even turn this car. This car is handling. I can't turn it.
[2028.02s -> 2035.83s]  Wait, I have like a bazooka. I might as well use it. Where is he? Right there? What's alt fire?
[2035.83s -> 2066.04s]  What's alt fire? How do I use- what is right click? Am I- is this working? Can I not go through the
[2066.04s -> 2101.42s]  fence? Oh shit! Got it. Got it. Oh my god, that's so far away. Stop! Like, whoa! Eat, eat, eat! I have
[2101.42s -> 2111.34s]  like fucking cheeseburgers. Eat as many as I can. All right, somebody just gave me a wedgie. That
[2111.34s -> 2133.21s]  was- that was the sound I just made. All right, that lieutenant's gone. All right, we gotta go.
[2133.21s -> 2160.06s]  Is there a time limit? Why am I running here? I need to get a car. Hey, get in. Get in the car.
[2160.06s -> 2174.87s]  I wanna- I want someone to come with me. What the fuck? Oh my god. I'm sorry. Shit. There's two
[2174.87s -> 2185.58s]  lieutenants over here by the gas station or whatever this is. Stop. Stop it. Oh my goodness,
[2185.58s -> 2196.50s]  he's trying to pull me out. There's so many of these sandwiched men. Holy shit. I have to throw
[2196.50s -> 2218.49s]  a grenade or something. Do I have any grenades? How do I not have grenades? Did they get it? Not
[2218.49s -> 2227.96s]  yet. Get back over there. Turn the sound up. Yeah, I'll turn the audio up on the game. Game audio's
[2227.96s -> 2238.44s]  going up. I need to- no. I need ammo first. Because honestly, these weapons are not loaded
[2238.44s -> 2259.59s]  very well. This game is too hard for you. No, it's not. The game is perfectly fine. Put on Christmas
[2259.59s -> 2272.71s]  music now. I love the Ernest level threat. That's like my favorite thing so far today.
[2273.35s -> 2291.58s]  I feel like my- ugh. Okay. Take this out. I have to go- I have money that I've collected, don't I?
[2292.47s -> 2300.46s]  The stash somewhere? Please move. Why are you suddenly Ernest's number one fan?
[2301.18s -> 2305.19s]  I don't think that's suddenly. I think I made it pretty clear over the years that
[2306.39s -> 2318.78s]  Ernest is like one of the most talented showmen. One thing that I'm really afraid of is them doing
[2318.78s -> 2323.42s]  like a young Ernest, right? Like, I don't want them to make another Ernest movie. Don't replace
[2323.42s -> 2327.74s]  Ernest. Don't make a new Ernest, right? Don't do that. There's real a lot of potential for that
[2327.74s -> 2331.90s]  to happen. I feel the same way about Gumby. Don't do Gumby again. They're gonna do it. I hope they
[2331.90s -> 2350.23s]  don't. They upstairs? Fuck. I need a flashbang or something. Don't I have flashbangs? I bought
[2350.23s -> 2367.14s]  like three of them. How much bullet- this is one bullet? Shoot the gun! I'm not ready for this one.
[2367.14s -> 2390.95s]  This is too much. What was that? There's still- no, they're already killed. Okay, good. There's
[2390.95s -> 2401.24s]  one more person upstairs. Maybe not. Where are you? Are you down? Did I run by this person?
[2401.24s -> 2416.47s]  How did I- all right, we're good. Move. Can I get one of these? Save. Holy shit. Thank you so much.
[2416.47s -> 2420.73s]  That would have been a disaster. I would have quit. I would have literally quit streaming right
[2420.73s -> 2446.10s]  there. Who the fuck are you? I need a car, of course. Give me this car. I picked the word- I
[2446.10s -> 2454.66s]  picked the car. The only- this car is so old. Give me that bike. That's what I want. I can shoot off
[2454.66s -> 2468.12s]  the bike. Go. I fucking hate- I'm quitting. I'm done streaming. Been a good run. It's over. I'm
[2468.12s -> 2479.61s]  done. Get off of me. I have to stay on the bike. Jesus, what the fuck? How come I don't have any
[2479.61s -> 2486.50s]  people here defending this with me? Why is it just Ernest? I understand that this is like my movie,
[2487.46s -> 2492.50s]  and- oh, where's- where's Dr. Strain? He's off world. Oh, what about Captain Marvel? Oh,
[2492.50s -> 2495.30s]  out of galaxy. But like seriously, where the fuck are they? Where are the other revengers?
[2496.66s -> 2511.83s]  Get off of me! Get in! Is that the lieutenant? Oh, I got him. I didn't. Where is this person?
[2512.71s -> 2537.35s]  I'm- are they inside? That's it? Now I'm stuck in here. I'm in- I'm in so much trouble.
[2537.35s -> 2546.71s]  All the- you can call your gang in the pause menu. Oh god, well, I'm gonna need them. Activities?
[2548.42s -> 2560.90s]  Hitman? No. Diversions? Where is it? Ernest starts a gang war. The phone? Where's my phone?
[2561.78s -> 2585.50s]  How do I get the phone? It's tab? What's that on controller? Select? It's in the menu. Oh,
[2585.50s -> 2597.03s]  fuck. Okay. All right. Phone. I need, uh, okay, homies. Call. I don't have any friends. Who do I
[2597.03s -> 2611.38s]  call? Do I call the police? Does that work? No, I don't want- I'm doing- I'm bad. I'm doing bad
[2611.38s -> 2639.24s]  things. I want a different gun. I think I cleared it out. All right, we're good. I need to make some
[2639.24s -> 2652.46s]  friends. Hey, there's a friend. Help me. Oh, this one sucked. I gotta hide somewhere. I'm gonna put
[2652.46s -> 2660.74s]  the car up right here and then hide behind it as cover. This is such a bad idea, isn't it?
[2661.30s -> 2697.67s]  That was gonna be so cool, but I missed every shot after that. Fuck. Oh, look at how many people
[2697.67s -> 2703.90s]  are here. How am I supposed to do this on my own? Is there anything back here I can use? Look at
[2703.90s -> 2734.36s]  the trail. How do you hit that fence? Oh no. Eat something. Eat something quick. Oh my fucking
[2734.36s -> 2752.84s]  god, dude. Give me a break. I'm about to drive up there. Fuck. There's too many. They're just
[2752.84s -> 2769.82s]  appearing now. Get in the car. Get in the- Please. Don't. Eat something quick. How am I supposed- I
[2769.82s -> 2776.81s]  don't understand how I'm gonna do this. They don't stop. There's more gang members right here than
[2776.81s -> 2784.17s]  there are people that live in this whole city. They keep coming. Did I get them? I got everybody.
[2784.17s -> 2808.78s]  Go. Please. Yeah, nice shot. You got them. Don't. You. They're relentless. They're relentless.
[2808.78s -> 2814.14s]  They're relentless. They're relentless. I can't get away from them. They're relentless.
[2815.88s -> 2828.20s]  I can't stop this. That was ridiculous. They were glued to my bumper.
[2830.78s -> 2835.82s]  Actually glued to the bumper and I have to go back and do this again? Oh, I'm going- No,
[2835.82s -> 2839.98s]  get weapons first. I keep losing money. All right, snap this person's neck because I'm pissed right
[2839.98s -> 2863.08s]  now. Okay, I want weapons. Give me weapons. I'm not going over there with the double magnum. It's not
[2863.08s -> 2869.91s]  gonna happen. Which way- Which store has good weapons? Uh, I don't- Brass Knuckles is good.
[2869.91s -> 2874.92s]  I think there's one here too, isn't there? Let's find out. Oh, do the Fight Club. Don't worry. I've
[2874.92s -> 2906.63s]  got- We got plenty of time. Oh, do insurance fraud? Maybe in a little bit. Just load the save.
[2906.63s -> 2910.07s]  I guess that would give me $17,000, but I have to sleep in the bed that I made, don't I?
[2910.95s -> 2919.56s]  I can't just- I gotta live with this. Somebody said if I do this- Let me see. Does this work?
[2922.84s -> 2933.10s]  Oh, hell yeah. Finally. How many can I have? All right, I got- I've got one member. Finally.
[2933.10s -> 2950.50s]  Let's go get some weapons. Clothing. Is this a weapons store? I have to reveal these on the map.
[2950.50s -> 2973.13s]  Let's see. No. All right, is this a weapons store? I don't- That one's melee. Name him? Uh,
[2976.18s -> 2994.09s]  double barrel. That's lame. What? You don't- I don't care. Is this a weapons store?
[2999.88s -> 3026.30s]  Does he use a shotgun? No, he's non-violent. All right, it's right here. Get rid of that
[3026.30s -> 3037.22s]  sussy shotgun. That shotgun really is awful. Okay, that's not it. Is there- Where is the
[3037.22s -> 3048.82s]  other weapons stores up here? There's only one? What the hell? I'm just gonna keep looking for one.
[3050.50s -> 3059.56s]  One of the mall? I guess that's right, but I don't want to go in the mall. Why did I say it like that?
[3071.48s -> 3081.37s]  Okay. I think it'd be fun to ride on a motorcycle with somebody. Am I getting more respect because
[3081.37s -> 3106.34s]  somebody's watching me do this? Oh, that's not one. Clothing store and- God damn. Shit. I guess I'm
[3106.34s -> 3133.54s]  gonna have to go to the mall. This is one over here, right? Stop cursing? Okay. All right,
[3133.54s -> 3145.08s]  every time I- No, I'm not doing that. That'd be fun though. I thought this game was about boating.
[3147.82s -> 3153.90s]  I was gonna name the stream Row Row Row Ya Boat, but that was probably not very good,
[3153.90s -> 3157.58s]  and it's probably wouldn't have been that funny. So I just said serving up some fresh games.
[3158.86s -> 3161.98s]  My voice is gone already. I didn't even do anything because I just woke up.
[3170.87s -> 3177.77s]  A hamburger joint. We're gonna just go to the mall. We're gonna wrap around to it already.
[3177.77s -> 3185.77s]  It's inevitable that we're gonna go there. It's 3 30 p.m. and you just woke up. Well, I woke up at
[3185.77s -> 3210.42s]  like 1 40. I was up all night. A Tesla? What is this place? Oh, it's Tattoos. Okay. I thought
[3210.42s -> 3234.42s]  it was a Tesla logo. There we go. That's what I want. Let's go. Please. Please.
[3235.22s -> 3247.37s]  Thanks. I love that. Please bring that back. It makes me look tough. Don't crash.
[3248.41s -> 3256.22s]  It didn't even crash. He's dead. I didn't. That was barely a crash, right? That was nothing.
[3257.02s -> 3270.01s]  Oh my God. That was nothing. I wasn't even going. That was going two miles per hour. Why would we
[3270.01s -> 3292.04s]  fly off like that? There's a diamond. Okay. It's the mall. Let's go. Wait, I have to see if he can
[3292.04s -> 3300.74s]  hit his head on this. Does that be funny? Okay. So, I drive straight from here. I wonder if I can
[3300.74s -> 3320.62s]  like take his head off. Okay. Ready? It needs to be right here. I mean, he scraped his head, but not
[3320.62s -> 3329.61s]  really. Where's the entrance? Right here? Mall entrance. No, that's like a front door. Where is
[3329.61s -> 3350.14s]  it? This thing goes too fast. Just go in? Yeah, there's a front door to this. I can't just go in?
[3350.94s -> 3374.95s]  I think it's up. Where's the entrance? There was a huge sign for mall entrance and you didn't go
[3374.95s -> 3381.83s]  in it. I can't even. All right. I'm fucking seriously considering fucking just abandoning
[3381.83s -> 3386.55s]  that area and who cares? I don't care if we lose it. It's like a hundred dollars a day. I'm going
[3386.55s -> 3394.76s]  to go do a mission. It's right here. We're doing a mission. I need like seven people to be in a car
[3394.76s -> 3411.98s]  with me. I'm just going to go do a mission. Mall entrance is beneath you. You can't lose areas. Oh,
[3411.98s -> 3426.46s]  well they made it seem like there was like time limit. I need this more than you. Oh no, double
[3426.46s -> 3435.29s]  barrels gone. Oh shit, that's right. Poor double barrel. He didn't last five minutes. All right,
[3435.29s -> 3456.18s]  let's do a mission. So check it out. You're looking at the old toy institute for science
[3456.18s -> 3460.90s]  and innovation, but the place isn't all Jacob's ladder and irrigation shit. In the center of it
[3460.90s -> 3466.58s]  all is a bunch of servers that run the Ronin's web porn ring. Those assholes are making serious
[3466.74s -> 3471.38s]  bank off their sites. So if you can take those bad boys out, the Ronin are definitely gonna be
[3471.38s -> 3483.56s]  hurting. So I gotta take out the porn servers. Yeah, I don't think I don't know about about this
[3483.56s -> 3488.94s]  one. Maybe we should attack one of their other site or one of their other zones. I don't think
[3488.94s -> 3500.66s]  this is gonna do very much. I don't I think we should hit him somewhere else. I don't have any
[3500.66s -> 3517.83s]  weapons. This is an airplane. I don't have any food either. And of course, of course, you're just
[3517.83s -> 3533.21s]  gonna show I have to take your guns. Give me their weapons. The weapons are better. They're faster.
[3535.99s -> 3538.47s]  That's oh my god. Why did I not do that in the first place? You kidding me?
[3539.66s -> 3542.78s]  No, put that person down. Put that person down. I'm not gonna shoot that person.
[3547.14s -> 3559.82s]  Get out. Revive, please. This person is walking around with a newspaper. What are you doing, man?
[3572.17s -> 3576.98s]  Good. All right. I thought that was a bad guy. I thought sorry. I'm really sorry. I'm really
[3576.98s -> 3581.11s]  sorry. I'm really sorry. But what I get out of here. I didn't I thought that was a bad guy. I
[3581.11s -> 3587.94s]  really did. He had like he had like a shirt on. All right. Can I order food from this? I can.
[3587.94s -> 3610.38s]  Where did you come from? Show that guy because he's wearing a shirt. No, I he ran he ran at me.
[3615.90s -> 3631.19s]  Okay, we're good. What the fuck was that? What's going on down there? You see the indicator?
[3631.75s -> 3660.84s]  Is somebody in here with a bike? All right, where's that server? This way. Oh, what is going on?
[3661.40s -> 3676.04s]  Look at the mini map. What the fuck is that? I need to see. There's nothing there. It's
[3676.04s -> 3693.91s]  cars beneath you. Oh, but I thought it was a helicopter, too. Yeah. I didn't mean to shoot
[3693.91s -> 3701.35s]  that guy, but whatever. He's all right. Destroy the servers. That's not a server. That was a gas
[3701.35s -> 3717.78s]  tank. I thought it was a server. All right, here we go. They don't know you can shoot through glass.
[3718.50s -> 3734.58s]  Not this class. I just alerted all of them. All right, we got a bunch of up here. Hey,
[3734.58s -> 3748.62s]  leave me alone. This is the standoff. Open it. Open the door. Open it. I dare you. I dare you
[3748.62s -> 3760.26s]  to open this door. Go on. You won't do it. Can they not open? I can't get hit. Let's hit.
[3769.32s -> 3773.24s]  Imagine you're in the middle of a gigantic action shootout and you're the guy that dies
[3773.24s -> 3794.39s]  by getting hit in the face by an empty recycling bin. I don't know what that was, but whatever.
[3804.74s -> 3814.02s]  No, not the porn. All right, I gotta get out. Head for the doors. I'm out of bullets. Hold on.
[3814.02s -> 3826.81s]  I gotta reload. There's definitely gonna be a confrontation outside. Is that it? I feel like
[3826.81s -> 3836.01s]  way more people were shot in here. Give me this thing. Yeah. All right, there we go. Perfect.
[3844.34s -> 3853.51s]  That's like seven years of bad luck. Whatever. I don't want to worry about that.
[3853.51s -> 3866.81s]  You gotta be fucking kidding me. Please get up. You can play that game.
[3866.81s -> 3918.20s]  Get the ammo. This game's hard. Sign. Oh, shit. Go. I barely hit anybody. Just fell over.
[3924.44s -> 3926.36s]  This is kind of how I feel like when I used to play Left 4 Dead.
[3928.30s -> 3933.13s]  So Left 4 Dead really can only work if you all are holding the piece of furniture together
[3933.13s -> 3937.29s]  and not one person's holding all the furniture, right? But, man, there were so many times where
[3937.29s -> 3941.45s]  I was just kind of lazy and was just kind of shooting around everything. Just kind of shooting
[3941.45s -> 3961.58s]  bullets so people knew that I was playing. Okay, wait. You have four people. All four of you have
[3961.58s -> 3966.86s]  to pull your weight. If not, you're gonna lose. If four of us are bringing a big couch into a living
[3966.86s -> 3974.06s]  room, all four of us have to pull our weight or someone's gonna be bad. You're always the dead
[3974.06s -> 3979.94s]  weight. I think one of the helicopters crashed. It's a very simple concept. What are you talking
[3979.94s -> 3987.77s]  about? If four of us are bringing a big couch into a living room, we all have to put weight into it
[3987.77s -> 4005.40s]  so not one person does everything and not one person can't lift a couch. Oh, my fucking god.
[4005.96s -> 4017.37s]  That guy just jumped. I thought you were talking about holding furniture in the game.
[4018.73s -> 4019.61s]  In Left 4 Dead.
[4024.58s -> 4028.42s]  You know, that actually would be kind of a fun game. What do I have to do?
[4032.18s -> 4049.30s]  Like, carry furniture together? A simulator? That might be fun. What am I supposed to do about this?
[4049.30s -> 4060.50s]  Oh, that was a bad idea. Where's the explosion? Why was that one done? Holy fucking shit. That was
[4060.50s -> 4074.41s]  bad. This is really bad. What do I do? I have to take this out? Did I miss something? I have to go
[4074.41s -> 4090.42s]  back to the bridge. Really? Now I can just shoot it? It'd be great if I had any bullets for any
[4090.42s -> 4101.80s]  gun and it takes a hundred years to reload this. It's finally reloaded. Jesus. Oh, my god. Oh, my
[4101.80s -> 4110.46s]  god. Oh, my god. This thing's still not reloaded. This gun's so bad. Why did I get two of these? What
[4110.46s -> 4120.87s]  a stupid idea. Do I have grenades in this? This is so bad. I need a gang member. Yeah, I'll be back.
[4121.59s -> 4136.68s]  Do I have any gang members? I had grenades. I got it. Don't worry. I'm gonna slowly take them out.
[4137.24s -> 4160.12s]  Watch out. I think they despawned. Yeah, they do. They despawned. I want that machine gun. Come here.
[4160.12s -> 4178.97s]  Got it. Nice. It's an easy two grand, I think. That was an hour later. I'll be here all day.
[4189.62s -> 4202.17s]  No, you won't. Don't call me out on things that are true. Got it. Save. We're good. What the? What
[4202.17s -> 4210.04s]  the hell is that? What is this like animated emote of like me with that like a handsome filter?
[4210.04s -> 4229.24s]  Where'd you get that? How do you have that? Whose is that? Where'd you get that? I'm so confused.
[4229.24s -> 4232.44s]  You finally saw it. Someone else put it on their channel.
[4238.92s -> 4261.58s]  That's illegal. That ain't that's illegal. Okay, now what? Okay, it's time to go to the weapon store
[4261.58s -> 4267.72s]  in the mall. Go buy a bunch of ammo and grenades and shit. Don't walk around the entrance and go,
[4268.44s -> 4272.04s]  I don't know where the entrance is. Just go in. Don't be an idiot.
[4272.76s -> 4314.92s]  You're good. You have to name this friend. Sean Silencer. How come they always have to have such
[4314.92s -> 4321.32s]  you know bad like weapon kill hurt names? Why can't it be like tree planting Andy or something?
[4333.61s -> 4346.97s]  Yeah, like Carl Conservationist. That's hippies.
[4349.56s -> 4355.16s]  There goes the finish on this baby. All right, how do we get into the mall?
[4357.21s -> 4369.56s]  How do I get into the mall? I'm so dumb. I'm sorry. Mall entrance. I'm just gonna go here
[4369.56s -> 4390.17s]  because this is underground though. I don't want to go in the garage. You can take the UFO through
[4390.17s -> 4414.30s]  here. Really? Holy shit. This is it? Riding with you is awesome. Wait, why would you be able? Why
[4414.30s -> 4426.82s]  would there be an opening for cars to the actual mall? All right, where's the weapon store? Right
[4426.90s -> 4452.47s]  here. Holy shit. That's cool. Okay, load up. I'm not fucking around now. I'm seriously not messing
[4452.47s -> 4461.86s]  around. Let's go. I want. Okay, I have one of these dudes. Is there something I'm missing? Get
[4461.86s -> 4475.35s]  get rid of this 12 gauge. Put the tombstone back on. Flashbangs. 10 flashbangs. All right, I want
[4476.23s -> 4485.42s]  SMG ammo. I'm using all my money. Right? I don't care. Use it all. I need to be able to do this.
[4486.22s -> 4502.01s]  What if I die? A melee I want. This is good. Pistol I want. What were the?
[4505.11s -> 4517.38s]  Yeah, if I double vice nines. SMG. How is there no SMG available? Tombstone. Whoa, what's that?
[4517.94s -> 4539.82s]  AR 40? Which one's better? 50 is higher than 40. So I'm gonna say 50. Okay, but do I have enough
[4539.82s -> 4548.87s]  ammo? Should I get pistol ammo? All right, I have a ton of. I have no money. I'm out of money.
[4550.98s -> 4563.00s]  I used $15,000. Was this worth it? Where's my buddy? Let's go. Where's the UFO? Can he get in
[4563.00s -> 4576.73s]  the UFO too? Where's the UFO? Didn't buy pistol ammo. I mean, I have almost a thousand rifle ammo.
[4576.73s -> 4588.46s]  I think I'm gonna be all right. Where's that UFO? What spot's the UFO on? Down here. What are the burgers?
[4588.46s -> 4620.09s]  Where is it? Turn around. Is it right here? Oh, right. I think this way. I just saved. I did.
[4622.30s -> 4628.65s]  Unedited Andy in the top right. What do you mean unedited? That's where one of the cars is. I think
[4628.65s -> 4648.62s]  it's right here. Shit, it's not right there. Where is it? Down there? Right ahead? I'm not going to
[4648.62s -> 4666.63s]  shoot anybody. I'm just using to see far further. Whoa, what's this place? That's good. That's good
[4666.63s -> 4685.40s]  too. That's good. No, I want to be able to see the face. Fireman. Whoa, this looks like a chef hat.
[4690.34s -> 4707.35s]  Cat ears. The lizard. Hold your helmet. Viking helmet. No. If I'm going to do something, I'm
[4707.35s -> 4735.61s]  going to do the... I want to be able to see the hair. Trubs. I can't look at outfits though.
[4735.61s -> 4759.42s]  Please do ski mask. Oh my god, this is Matthew Lesko. Hey, everyone. Me, Matthew Lesko. And I mean,
[4759.42s -> 4764.14s]  I got these crazy government things you can get. You want to go to $20,000 to go back to school.
[4764.14s -> 4769.70s]  I can get that for you. $40,000 to start a new job. I should be Matthew Lesko. I really should.
[4786.17s -> 4794.66s]  Cat's too zoomer to know who Matthew Lesko is. It's great. Matthew Lesko is actually a really,
[4794.66s -> 4814.26s]  really like wonderful person. Free money. Yeah. You know him? No, I don't. All right. Yeah. Okay.
[4814.26s -> 4820.38s]  I don't know him, but he seems like a really, really nice person. Parasocial Andy. No, I'm just
[4820.38s -> 4827.06s]  saying like the way that the person's presented. Just quiet or I'm going to, I'll ban everybody.
[4827.78s -> 4847.34s]  Paris. I kind of want the lab coat. Flasher coat. Oh, all right. This is, I think I'm going to go
[4847.34s -> 4862.34s]  with the, with the Matthew Lesko. I got style level one. Okay. Oh shit. I get 5% more respect
[4862.34s -> 4881.38s]  during activities. Okay. I need to do this. I got to change this to the same color. Is it like purple?
[4881.94s -> 4895.85s]  Like a dark purple, like a purple pink. Where is it? Where's the green? Is it yellow? Where's yellow?
[4895.85s -> 4916.62s]  This is darker. There it is. Oh shit. I can just look at the color right there.
[4925.88s -> 4930.63s]  Solid. Oh, the hearts. I think solid because the question marks will clash.
[4931.35s -> 4959.18s]  Okay. I need a better hat though. Human eyes. Oh. Do cat ears, please. Ski mask. Fine. I'll do the
[4959.18s -> 4968.92s]  ski mask. What is it? Under, over shirts? Yeah. Under shirts. Oh, it takes off the coat. I can't
[4968.92s -> 4985.86s]  do the ski mask. Does it take, it takes the coat off, right? I don't think it does. Okay. Well,
[4985.86s -> 5001.06s]  I'll try it. Let's see. Okay. It's just, it's, I'm just in a grim, I'm just grimace. Is that
[5001.06s -> 5028.90s]  going to work? I have to take this hat off though. It's a spy. Gentlemen. This is one of those like,
[5029.62s -> 5034.26s]  you, you like combine two or three costumes. You're like the spy in another universe.
[5035.70s -> 5056.84s]  I'm the spy, but I'm in the Batman universe. No, you, okay. Okay. I think we're ready.
[5057.48s -> 5067.16s]  We're ready to go take back the, uh, the territory. Now we just need to find the UFO.
[5067.16s -> 5071.70s]  We can skedaddle. Save. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got
[5071.70s -> 5078.70s]  it. So I'm just going to sit here on this map because I'm, I'm, I'll walk around in a circle
[5078.70s -> 5092.92s]  for the next 10 minutes. Where is the UFO on here? Where is it? Top right, right here.
[5093.48s -> 5106.79s]  It's a random spawn. Oh, top left, middle and right. Like up here, up your ass. Fuck you.
[5106.79s -> 5114.79s]  You know what? No, let me freeze for a second. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. You know what
[5114.79s -> 5130.42s]  I mean? All right. It's right there. Let's try it. Oh shit. That's a nice car. Fuck you. You know
[5130.42s -> 5152.97s]  what I mean? No, that's where I came in with the car. It's not a top right. It's a random. I,
[5152.97s -> 5164.31s]  I'm just going to get in the car and just drive around and who cares. I thought German was the
[5164.31s -> 5169.34s]  nice guy. I am. I really am. I'm, I've just been having fun, right? It's all just a joke.
[5169.98s -> 5174.94s]  Nothing I say is really, you should never take seriously. Fuck you. You know what I mean?
[5175.58s -> 5185.27s]  I want people to know that this is a place for positivity. Fuck you. You know what I mean? And
[5185.27s -> 5188.95s]  for us to come together and be good friends. Fuck you. You know what I mean?
[5196.76s -> 5211.42s]  Where is the UFO? I'm just like, this car is insane. We're just taking this thing. Are you
[5211.42s -> 5216.97s]  kidding me? We're just going to keep this. Why would I take something else? Let's get the hell
[5216.97s -> 5237.74s]  out of here. UFO or riot. I don't know what it's, it's a random spawn somewhere. Wait, what's called
[5237.74s -> 5259.78s]  UFO? No. Oh, that was cool. All right. I get, I have to leave. I have to get out of this. I've,
[5260.34s -> 5267.21s]  you want to know something? Here's a little insight. I'm not kidding. When I say this,
[5267.21s -> 5274.49s]  this is for real. Listen to me. Even at a real mall, a real one. If I, even if I've been there
[5274.49s -> 5281.37s]  500 times, I don't know where I am. I don't know where I am because everything's the same.
[5281.93s -> 5293.48s]  What the fuck is going on in here? It doesn't matter if I've been there 10 times, 50 times,
[5293.48s -> 5298.36s]  a thousand times. I don't know where the Auntie Anne's pretzel is, if you ask me.
[5298.92s -> 5303.08s]  And it sucks so bad in these positions when like stuff like kind of in the say is the same.
[5303.96s -> 5313.02s]  When everything like looks the same, everything like is the same. Jesus Christ. Because people
[5313.02s -> 5322.12s]  will ask me, people will ask me, Hey dude. Oh yeah. Oh, you, you know this place. Where's the
[5322.12s -> 5338.81s]  Auntie Anne? And I have to pretend like I know where it is yet. Help me. It's like getting stuck
[5338.81s -> 5355.06s]  in snow. Just pick up a few chairs and get rid of them. Um, but yeah, like anything that is a bunch
[5355.06s -> 5361.67s]  of stores or a bunch of stuff that looks very similar, my brain cannot put it into long-term
[5361.67s -> 5368.23s]  memory because it's one gigantic place. It's not multiple places in one. It's not multiple places
[5368.23s -> 5392.54s]  inside of one place. It's one place and I can't differentiate it. Is that enough? You have to be,
[5392.54s -> 5410.09s]  you actually have to be kidding. Can I shoot them? Maybe I can shoot them away. Jesus dude.
[5416.50s -> 5441.38s]  Okay. Almost there. Got it. I almost just blew up and screamed. Where's the exit?
[5441.38s -> 5468.81s]  How do I get out of here? Help me please. Is it right? I'm in tears. What are you laughing this
[5468.81s -> 5475.30s]  hard? How? What? Why are you laughing so hard? What do you mean you're in tears?
[5481.86s -> 5488.74s]  Is it on the second level? I think it's up here because remember
[5489.46s -> 5503.46s]  I came in this way I think. Um, I think right like this way over here. This is the top floor.
[5513.35s -> 5528.89s]  Okay then up this way. All right there it is. Is this it? Is this it? Get the fuck out of here.
[5528.89s -> 5536.15s]  I'm never going in there ever again. It's the concrete. It's the different leveled concrete
[5536.15s -> 5554.30s]  with everything same in there. I'm not going to freak out. Those of you that saw the Hitman 3
[5554.30s -> 5560.79s]  playthrough. That's uh, that's one of the maddest I've been in the entire year I think. And I
[5560.79s -> 5564.79s]  pretended I was high. So people wouldn't even think I was an idiot. All right you ready? Let's
[5564.79s -> 5580.12s]  go. Save the game. We're going. We're gonna uh, whatever. Get in there. What's wrong with the- oh
[5581.67s -> 5627.70s]  tire. Not fucking around this time. I swear to god. Open up. Open up. Good. Go. 20 fps. Let's go.
[5627.78s -> 5677.96s]  Get. Oh no you have like a hostage. What was that? Was that an explosion? Like I'm too,
[5677.96s -> 5682.20s]  I'm too much like a fat guy to turn and spray faster so I just hold it down.
[5683.93s -> 5688.25s]  All right we gotta have to have a new plan here I think. It's the grenade launcher. Oh right right
[5688.25s -> 5707.96s]  right right right. We need a new car. This brake. We have to get a new car like right now. Are you
[5707.96s -> 5716.26s]  out of the way? Get out of there. What's this guy's name? Sleepy? Sleepy Sean? I forget what
[5716.26s -> 5735.83s]  his name was. Let's go. In. He's in. Good. Silencer Sean. Okay. I'm out of. We're losing control. We
[5735.83s -> 5749.85s]  gotta get out. It's gonna explode in a minute. They're everywhere. This is unbelievable. Get in
[5749.85s -> 5783.05s]  this one. Silencer let's go. Come on silencer. Get in the car. How did you have the top down
[5783.05s -> 5789.69s]  in this car? I don't understand. Do you see how relentless they are? They're glued to you.
[5796.55s -> 5814.90s]  He's not even looking. Oh shit. Okay hold on. They're up. Up up up up up up up right here. I'm
[5814.90s -> 5821.75s]  gonna shoot a grenade. Who was shooting who there? That was confusing. I think that did that person
[5821.75s -> 5828.66s]  have a hostage? I have no idea. We got it. Thank god. How do you feel about Garfield precisely?
[5829.77s -> 5837.16s]  Um Garfield should have been a mini series that lasted like a year. I think people would be
[5837.16s -> 5858.87s]  happier. All right we got our everything back. Tiny face cam. There's no face cam.
[5859.59s -> 5877.53s]  Where do you guys see a face cam? What? Up right? Yeah. All right now that's taken care of. I'm
[5877.53s -> 5900.33s]  gonna do the other the next Roman mission. Face cam over the guy's face. You can call an ambulance
[5900.33s -> 5918.09s]  to heal. I need to make friends. I want to be able to call people to come help me in situations.
[5918.09s -> 5935.08s]  Looking stupid. For one second I thought the guy in the passenger seat was driving and there was
[5935.08s -> 5950.68s]  a blanket in the front seat. Well that was custom upholstery for the seat. Like this is what I saw
[5950.68s -> 5969.51s]  for a second. It was like a weird angle. Where's Johnny? Oh I sent him out to the store. You should
[5969.51s -> 5976.07s]  be back. Who the hell is that? Yo that's our new houseguest baby. I caught this asshole riding
[5976.07s -> 5983.67s]  around our turf. Got something you want to tell me? Go to hell. That wasn't very nice.
[5985.67s -> 5992.81s]  That was so loud my head hurts now. Why the fuck are you here? Whatever you do to me is nothing
[5992.81s -> 6001.27s]  compared to what Mr. Okuji will do to you. The oil burn? No shit. When's he coming? I'll die before
[6001.27s -> 6011.27s]  I tell you. Yep. It better. You get okay. You don't you say you're gonna do it you don't do it
[6011.27s -> 6015.67s]  you see if he tells you anything. You gotta give me at least two or three chances. This guy's a
[6015.67s -> 6019.77s]  fucking boogeyman. When I was in jail I would listen to some of the Ronin talk about what this
[6019.77s -> 6026.66s]  guy did in Japan. It's not pretty. You think he's old talk? I don't know but I'm looking forward
[6026.66s -> 6033.32s]  to finding out. You cool taking out those fuckers by yourself. Or oh here's an idea.
[6033.32s -> 6042.46s]  No problem man. Level with the guy. Put the gun down. Set him down. Be like look here's where
[6042.46s -> 6054.09s]  we're coming from. Like like order like order like pizza. Talk about everything. Be like look
[6055.45s -> 6065.78s]  we can level here. Then when they give you the information you might have you might have already
[6065.78s -> 6086.66s]  to remember. Oh you got somebody on the inside. I was gonna say then you throw him out the window
[6086.66s -> 6113.77s]  but no I didn't want to say that. I have to destroy all these right? I wasn't why was I
[6113.77s -> 6120.70s]  wasn't looking to chat he's dead oh no. What the fuck? How do I get back on the bike? You're about
[6120.70s -> 6145.64s]  to abandon a follower? Where is he? I don't even know where he is. What? Where is he? You want to
[6145.96s -> 6156.09s]  come here? I have no idea where he is. Abandoned apparently. Old up to dismiss party. Oh okay here
[6156.09s -> 6187.98s]  we go. Let's go. Don't shoot. Christ. Get on the right side of the road you idiot. New friend.
[6202.41s -> 6223.26s]  Whatever. Let's go. Oh wait we got we got slimy Sean back. What was the point of that entire U-turn?
[6230.25s -> 6248.28s]  These missions are kind of hard. Here we go. All right four to four.
[6249.80s -> 6265.02s]  No here it is. Here's four. I don't think that's so close to me. Why is this not disabled? Uh huh.
[6265.02s -> 6277.37s]  What? What are you talking about? That was four. How is he dead? It was the wrong bike?
[6278.09s -> 6323.99s]  He's dead. How am I gonna pull it out of the concrete? Get on. Okay if I get close enough
[6323.99s -> 6339.99s]  he should be able to shoot them right? Theoretically. I didn't hit anything. The guy was lying.
[6340.79s -> 6354.14s]  I guess I- my god fuck you. Fuck you god damn it. All right there's only one more come on.
[6354.14s -> 6388.39s]  Don't please do not fly. Dread air. Am I gonna catch up? I did it. Okay we're good.
[6413.69s -> 6417.93s]  Not for long. Why's that? I've got my best man working on that now.
[6418.65s -> 6422.73s]  Do some of the other missions. We've been doing most of the Ronin stuff.
[6422.73s -> 6434.54s]  Maybe we'll start somewhere else. Ronins have the best missions though. What is it Shogo?
[6435.50s -> 6440.71s]  I'll take care of it like always.
[6454.54s -> 6463.91s]  I want to buy a car that's mine that I keep in a garage. I don't just want to steal cars for the
[6463.91s -> 6480.44s]  entire game. Okay this is the loft. It's for sale. How about another Ronin mission? Why not?
[6481.08s -> 6495.30s]  You can literally steal any car for free in store. Yeah aren't there some cars you can only buy?
[6496.10s -> 6502.18s]  Aren't there some kind of- because this is Gentleman of the Row. So isn't there some things
[6502.18s -> 6517.99s]  that I can only get from Gentleman of the Row? Is this better than Saints Row 3? Um I don't-
[6517.99s -> 6524.55s]  people feel the same way about Saints Row that people feel about Dark Souls. Very contested.
[6524.55s -> 6531.96s]  Very heated. Saints Row 2 is the best. No that's an idiotic opinion. Saints Row 4 is the best.
[6532.68s -> 6547.88s]  Are you serious? That's the worst one. From my understanding, from what I've been told and
[6547.88s -> 6554.04s]  because I've never lived- I've never played these. Saints Row 2 is the combination of the seriousness
[6554.04s -> 6559.88s]  of Saints Row 1 potentially with like a little bit of the more cartoony weird wacky shit that
[6559.88s -> 6576.98s]  they did in the later games. I've heard that's the middle ground here is Saints Row 2. Sorry
[6576.98s -> 6590.01s]  I was reading chat. This is the middle ground. Um if you don't know the Saints Row franchise
[6590.01s -> 6595.45s]  eventually you can run up buildings and fly and stuff. You actually have superpowers.
[6596.01s -> 6601.72s]  It's a superhero game. They're kind of rebooting the whole franchise right? And didn't they say
[6602.52s -> 6609.24s]  that uh we can't- we have to like reel it back to reality because they went too far in the fourth
[6609.24s -> 6622.73s]  one? I have no idea how that one's going to turn out. That was stupid. What does Dark Souls have
[6622.73s -> 6627.77s]  to do with this? Um well that's easy. There's like four games in the Dark Souls quote series.
[6628.41s -> 6635.27s]  You count Demon's Souls. Uh and everybody thinks that Dark Souls 1 is the best. But then you have
[6635.27s -> 6639.03s]  people that think Dark Souls 3 is better than Dark Souls 1. Then you have people that say that uh
[6639.03s -> 6652.06s]  that Demon's Souls is better than all of them. And you've got the weirdos that think that Dark
[6652.06s -> 6680.14s]  Souls 2 is the best one right? Pleasureness. Then let me go. That depends on you. Dark Souls 2 is
[6680.14s -> 6688.30s]  the best one. I can't take anything going on seriously. Like I- should I like
[6688.30s -> 6704.90s]  drag the sliders back a little? You should go to a plastic surgeon.
[6712.94s -> 6717.58s]  The person just like landed on their neck. The person just put themselves in the hospital.
[6717.58s -> 6756.71s]  Oh shit. This is really making me understand that like nobody kind of- nobody looks cool
[6756.71s -> 6799.29s]  in a superhero costume doing stuff. You can't hear me. I know. Oh shit no. Of course it doesn't work.
[6799.29s -> 6826.95s]  You didn't pull the trigger. Oh all right. Good- good thing- good thing Sli-Sli-Slippery
[6827.27s -> 6832.68s]  is here with me. Protect Gat? Where- oh he's back there.
[6837.05s -> 6841.13s]  We have to- get off- get off the bike. Get off the bike. Get off the bike. You gotta go. You gotta go.
[6841.13s -> 6845.45s]  You gotta go. You gotta go. You gotta go. Who- where are you? Where are they? Where are they?
[6846.09s -> 6860.94s]  Do I have to pick him up? What do we do? Is he all right? What's happening? Why is it a countdown?
[6861.50s -> 6878.06s]  Why is there a countdown? Is it gonna explode? What? Flash man go now!
[6878.62s -> 6902.20s]  What are you calling me? Are you kidding me? Did it- what the fuck?
[6905.22s -> 6909.22s]  Watch where you're shooting. You're gonna shoot him in the head. You're gonna shoot him in the head.
[6909.22s -> 6914.10s]  It's easy with where you're aiming the gun. What the fuck was that? Oh I have a bazooka.
[6914.10s -> 6922.28s]  I didn't know I had a bazooka. They just give you these weapons. I didn't know I had this.
[6926.18s -> 6929.46s]  That's- those aren't even enemies. He's gonna hit him in the head.
[6937.18s -> 6949.29s]  Just focus on driving the car you fucking idiot. This is so stupid. I can't even aim this. He's-
[6949.29s -> 6960.87s]  what's happening? Who's in front of us? Why are we on fire? I can't shoot anybody with this
[6960.87s -> 6974.57s]  because it's too close. We're gonna die. We're supposed to be going to the hospital. I think
[6974.57s -> 6986.07s]  he's driven in a circle. I can't fire at this close. What? Stop jerking the car around. For
[6986.07s -> 7009.29s]  the love of god just drives normally. We're driving on somebody's house? Holy shit. That was
[7009.29s -> 7028.54s]  unbelievable. Crazy taxi. Here we go. Sorry that was 1080 snowboarding. I mixed them up together.
[7038.81s -> 7056.63s]  Can we get out? Oh my god he's running people over. Play the America's Funniest Home Videos
[7056.63s -> 7070.66s]  theme song right now. No. Where's he going? I don't know. I'm not driving. I think he's
[7070.66s -> 7085.50s]  driving to the hospital. I think? This guy is absolutely- he's gonna stick around. What's
[7085.50s -> 7093.53s]  this guy's name? Slobber and Sam? No no no that's a 90s kids board game. Whatever his name is. Who
[7093.53s -> 7106.09s]  cares? Doesn't matter. Oh that was a stupid idea but we're okay. John Silencer. That's right.
[7108.31s -> 7140.34s]  I look so happy. I have a big smile. Where's the hospital? Can I switch weapons? I can't switch
[7140.34s -> 7168.22s]  weapons. This guy's lost? It kind of feels that way. I don't have to do anything do I? Check the
[7168.22s -> 7190.81s]  map. Is it hospital right here? Oh there it is. Okay we made it. Can we get out? All right we're
[7190.81s -> 7210.01s]  good. Taking him to plastic surgery. He just comes out with like a cheek implant or something.
[7210.57s -> 7215.37s]  He's dead.
[7228.89s -> 7251.32s]  Must be so sweaty and hot under that mask. 500 cash per day. I get 6,000. Should I do an activity?
[7251.32s -> 7283.00s]  Maybe I should. What's this one? Please go to the plastic surgeon. Should I? Yes finally finally
[7283.00s -> 7294.12s]  finally finally yes finally finally finally. What do you mean finally? Okay. Let me just design
[7294.12s -> 7297.40s]  allows you to change your appearance, customize your movement, combat style, taunts and compliments.
[7297.40s -> 7303.35s]  Oh okay. It also removes your notoriety. Well I don't want to change. I don't want to change
[7303.35s -> 7323.50s]  my- I don't want to change Grimace. I wanted to do this though whatever it was. What do we want here?
[7323.58s -> 7341.43s]  The the grill? The griddler? Like a mcriddle? The mcriddler? Thank god I just saved because
[7341.43s -> 7363.14s]  the game crashed. I like the mcriddler. That's a good one. Please put the sliders back a little
[7363.14s -> 7382.34s]  bit. I don't think we- I can't do that. Crashed again? Shit. That's not good. Ooh too powerful.
[7383.14s -> 7393.66s]  Take a pee break. Uh maybe in a minute. I'm locked in. This game's boring you should play Fortnite.
[7399.00s -> 7412.44s]  Yeah I see you right here. All right can I- isn't there something I can do?
[7414.14s -> 7420.98s]  Right? This is- why is it so bright in here? Holy goodness. What the hell? It's so bright.
[7421.46s -> 7442.14s]  Is this illuminated paint in here? What? Whoa. It was 10 grand in that. Oh that's awesome.
[7442.70s -> 7454.39s]  All right nice. I got money now. I'm gonna go buy something. I finally went into a house and took
[7454.39s -> 7467.94s]  the money. Yeah. Is there anything in the garage? Probably not. No. Nothing. Gamble it all the way?
[7467.94s -> 7479.19s]  No. Oh what's this here? Oh wait there's the the hitman activities. Let me see what they were.
[7479.19s -> 7487.61s]  Trailer park hitman. Okay. You know the security security guard for the trailer park. Start a fight
[7487.61s -> 7492.84s]  in the area and someone is bound to call them over to settle the argument. Okay go to the trailer
[7492.84s -> 7504.87s]  park district and fight the security guard. The trailer park district is where? Insurance fraud
[7504.87s -> 7526.10s]  activities are really fun. It's the crutches icon. Have I found one? It's the left side? Okay.
[7526.10s -> 7552.22s]  Check the south. Okay. Change filters on the map. Well here's mayhem. I don't think I've even seen
[7552.22s -> 7570.50s]  a crutches. Should we go here? I haven't found any you know. Let's go see what this is. The McRiddler.
[7573.32s -> 7577.16s]  McRiddler absolutely is confirmed for the end of the year rumble by the way.
[7578.70s -> 7585.94s]  Kind of a hundred and all stats. Oh by the way let's talk about that real quick. This weekend
[7587.14s -> 7594.06s]  probably before Sunday's stream the New Year's Eve categories are going to be up.
[7594.06s -> 7598.79s]  Probably this will be on Sunday and you're going to be able to do them. We're going to go through
[7598.79s -> 7606.62s]  the nominating process again and then a week or two later voting will open and then obviously
[7606.62s -> 7615.78s]  two or three weeks later we'll do the award show. So look for the nominees to open up this weekend.
[7617.26s -> 7619.90s]  If a lot of people are probably new to the channel in the last year.
[7621.34s -> 7630.55s]  Every year we do an event on New Year's Eve. That is the worst of the year and some best of the
[7630.55s -> 7634.92s]  year as well. Talking the worst stream of the year. Worst noise I've made the whole year.
[7635.64s -> 7641.11s]  The worst face I've made the whole year. The annual tradition. We're going to keep it up again
[7641.11s -> 7646.36s]  this year. If you'd like to participate. You remember an exact moment in time where
[7647.00s -> 7651.24s]  you were like that face was awful and it was disgusting. He looked terrible. His hair looked
[7651.24s -> 7660.47s]  awful. Worst hair. Give us the timestamp. Give us the clip. We'll go from there. Annual cyber
[7660.47s -> 7675.98s]  bullying of the streamer. The worst hair ever was last year. I know and it'll never get. I don't
[7675.98s -> 7692.54s]  think you'll ever find one that's worse. What is this? That's a new icon. Fight club. Are you
[7692.54s -> 7695.98s]  going to stream the game awards on the 9th? Yeah I would say so.
[7701.18s -> 7705.98s]  The right idea. Horse pussy man. I can break any of those assholes that are fighting if I was
[7705.98s -> 7711.74s]  cleared. The fight's going on now. Yeah. Shit I might as well take your spot. Hey you can't do
[7711.74s -> 7722.42s]  that. Yeah why don't you run and catch up. Hey fuck you asshole. Okay. Compete in brutal fighting
[7722.42s -> 7728.01s]  matches for cash and respect. Pick up and eat food to recover health. Kill all the fighters and
[7728.01s -> 7738.04s]  survive. Two one. I got a good tactic. It's called run and let them fight each other first. Oh wait
[7738.04s -> 7756.98s]  it's 2v1 never mind. Is that illegal? Wait you can kick people in the balls. That's not illegal.
[7763.03s -> 7780.95s]  I feel like it would be really. Oh shit. They just dropped that on his head. Finish opponents
[7780.95s -> 7795.83s]  after a knockdown to take them out of the fight. I don't know what one is. It's A. Where'd you go?
[7796.47s -> 7807.03s]  That guy didn't have a chance. I feel like I'm going to be really good at this.
[7813.56s -> 7832.25s]  A hundred bucks. That's a lot of respect. Let's keep going. Okay level two. Three two one.
[7834.82s -> 7852.50s]  Go get style points for taunting. Come on give me the trash. Put that down. Get out of here.
[7864.73s -> 7879.59s]  Shit he has it. That thing's too hard to swing. Wait what's two? Oh no that's bad. A or is it B?
[7880.31s -> 7897.24s]  Okay it's X. Two is X. Dude I just keep changing. I don't know what these are.
[7897.80s -> 7901.16s]  With the command prompts. I'm just gonna have to pick up the fucking mouse and do it.
[7901.80s -> 7922.25s]  What is it? Game. I just fucking. If I press. I just right clicked and the fucking window minimized.
[7922.81s -> 7946.12s]  What is right click on the controller? Right click. It would be left trigger. Yep. Blunt.
[7952.95s -> 7978.12s]  That didn't. That hurt me. That didn't even do anything good for me. Oh very cool. Nice. This is
[7978.12s -> 7988.87s]  a really good way to farm respect. 3v1. All right this is gonna get hard. Especially because of the
[7988.87s -> 8021.75s]  not knowing what the buttons are. Hit him. Oh rock bottom. Rock bottom. Why did I stand up and fall?
[8021.75s -> 8035.16s]  This is an unfair weight class. Left. Left click is right trigger. Right? Yeah. It's just confusing.
[8044.81s -> 8056.90s]  What is it? That's. No god it's left. What is that? Left trigger. Left click is right trigger.
[8056.90s -> 8069.45s]  Because that's. Shoot. That's. Okay I'm pissed. Left trigger is aim. It is?
[8070.25s -> 8099.22s]  So it'll be right. Left. So it'll be right trigger. Okay. There we go. All right. We're good.
[8106.49s -> 8123.98s]  I got a little weird. Left is right. Yeah. It's confusing me. Yeah the button prompts are supposed
[8123.98s -> 8133.10s]  to be in the mod. I looked back at the um like at the mod files. It's supposed to be there.
[8133.10s -> 8144.46s]  You've unlocked the nut punch. Okay. There's an option in the installer. Yeah. You didn't pick
[8144.46s -> 8150.39s]  that option. The installer I was kind of scared of. Because it was like just build it the default mod
[8150.39s -> 8154.65s]  the way that the mod is meant to be played. Or you could go through and pick stuff and it would
[8154.65s -> 8159.46s]  add it but it wouldn't. I don't know. It was confusing. As you play Saints Row 2 you unlock
[8159.46s -> 8172.63s]  rewards. To see them press the pause menu. Is it going to be impossible? Maybe they actually are
[8172.63s -> 8181.66s]  fighting each other. They are. All right. Just run away. Come on gridler. You need to save.
[8182.30s -> 8194.50s]  All right. That guy. That's the guy to beat right there. The Hurricane Rana guy. It's the Abyss
[8194.50s -> 8217.54s]  Watchers. It is. I just hit myself in the face with the trash can. Are you kidding me?
[8218.18s -> 8245.05s]  I need a hamburger on the ground. What is it? Two. Start. Give me it. Drink it. That feels like
[8245.05s -> 8269.88s]  cheating. I feel like I'm drinking Estus. Fight. Fight each other. Don't just fight me. This guy's
[8269.88s -> 8298.07s]  close. All right. This guy's done. That was the really scary guy. He was doing like roundhouse
[8298.07s -> 8312.86s]  kicks and shit. How many levels are there? Ten. You can switch your fighting style at the surgeon.
[8317.53s -> 8321.21s]  If you drank the Estus flask at any point in Dark Souls you're not a real gamer.
[8321.21s -> 8348.87s]  That's fine. Five people. I'm not going to be able to string any combos together on anybody.
[8348.87s -> 8369.16s]  I don't think at least. I'm just spamming. I don't even know who I'm hitting. Dark Souls
[8369.16s -> 8373.05s]  Resident Sleeper. Really? People love that game. What do you mean?
[8387.19s -> 8400.02s]  There's one guy that doesn't like Dark Souls. You know there's one guy for everything. Always
[8400.02s -> 8417.46s]  remember that you are the one guy for something. Always. No matter what. I'm trying to think of
[8417.46s -> 8426.26s]  what I'm the one guy for. There's probably a few things. What am I the one guy of?
[8426.26s -> 8442.23s]  What opinion do I have? What thing would I say? The sus guy. Well I'm not though.
[8447.69s -> 8481.16s]  I hope they booed that. Damn it. This is really easy to do though. I'm farming respect. Get him.
[8481.16s -> 8503.37s]  Get him. Wait hold on. I'm trying to hit an audience member. Are you streaming the game awards?
[8503.37s -> 8523.64s]  Yes. In my special outfit. 11,000 respect. Nice. There's more. One, two, three, four, five, six.
[8523.64s -> 8543.90s]  Are we really going to put ten people in here? No way. I have $20,000. This is awesome. All right.
[8543.90s -> 8556.01s]  Focus. The second somebody kicks somebody in the balls everything's stopping and then this person
[8556.01s -> 8561.82s]  is gonna get thrown out. I'm gonna get fucking beat up on the way out of this place. I'm gonna
[8561.82s -> 8585.46s]  get my fucking face kicked in all the way outside of the restaurant. Save the game. Whatever. Like
[8585.46s -> 8595.45s]  the arena. I don't know why I said restaurant. That's true. Kick him. Let me up. Get away from me.
[8597.54s -> 8601.38s]  God damn it. See I kicked somebody in the balls and now everybody wants to kill me.
[8608.10s -> 8615.99s]  I'm gonna lose. Oh wait he's got me. He's gonna break my neck. I didn't know they could do it to you
[8615.99s -> 8640.92s]  too. I'm just gonna be a vulture. What the? Oh it changes. No I wanted that. Give me that.
[8652.60s -> 8663.35s]  Omega low five-year-old. What do you mean five-year-old? I'm okay. Everything's fine.
[8663.35s -> 8678.71s]  Presidency. I know I'm just like doing this over and over again but I'm getting so much
[8678.71s -> 8693.66s]  money and so much respect. It's barely really helpful. Game's gonna crash. I hope not.
[8694.22s -> 8710.92s]  Can I save it right now? What? Progress during this activity will not save. That's annoying.
[8716.92s -> 8751.32s]  Please. Okay there we go. Saves what level you got up to. All right. Holy shit. Five grand. Holy shit
[8751.32s -> 8762.22s]  this is awesome. I unlocked pump. Your melee attacks now do a lot more damage. So okay somebody
[8762.22s -> 8768.22s]  correct me here. If I exit this, save it, and then go back. Can I play at level six or do I have to
[8768.22s -> 8783.67s]  start at level one? Well that was it. That actually was the whole thing. Oh okay. Nice. I got a ton of
[8783.67s -> 8794.10s]  respect for that. I'm at time seven respect. Cool. All right let's go. Where should I do the...
[8797.58s -> 8811.53s]  What else is down here? I'll do insurance fraud. Yeah yeah yeah. Over here? Do insurance. I'm going.
[8823.14s -> 8835.96s]  This is so much fun. Can I tell you guys that? Can we just talk? I didn't get very much sleep
[8835.96s -> 8842.04s]  last night. I'm so fucking excited. I can't wait. It's gonna be so much fun.
[8844.62s -> 8853.35s]  Ugh. There's so much fun shit to do. I just want to scream it at you. You know what I mean? I want to
[8853.35s -> 8862.47s]  scream it so loud. I want to yell at you. It's all I can think about. I can't think of anything else.
[8863.03s -> 8886.81s]  Is that it? Immolation derby. That sounds like fun. I'm doing it. What are you talking about?
[8887.45s -> 8908.82s]  I'm talking about 2022. It is going to be a lot of fun. Where is this? The streamer is vague. Yeah I
[8908.82s -> 8931.16s]  know. Congrats on the kid. You know there was one point where I wanted to hire like a five-year-old
[8931.16s -> 8939.05s]  actor to come in the room and be like. Like dad. Like can you. I'm scared. Can you read me a story?
[8939.05s -> 8943.19s]  And I was gonna be like it's okay son. I'll be in there in a minute. I was gonna have like a
[8943.19s -> 8950.87s]  five-year-old actor like be on stream and pretend to be like my son. People would be like what the
[8950.87s -> 8956.68s]  you have like a six-year-old? What? And I'd be like yeah I just got I've kept it private you know.
[8956.68s -> 8976.17s]  Okay select your car for the demo. Oh I select my car. There's gonna be an actor. It was gonna be
[8976.17s -> 9000.92s]  an actor. That would have been fucked up. Okay car. I want this. Level one. Level two. Oh wait
[9000.92s -> 9006.92s]  I only have one point? What do you mean one point? Make it a fully grown adult actor?
[9010.62s -> 9017.53s]  You don't think that would have been weird? You don't think that was it's weird if a full
[9017.53s -> 9025.05s]  grown adult walked in here and was like asking me to like read um are you serious? My version
[9025.05s -> 9040.54s]  was weird but that one's the the funny one. I think I'm gonna do defense. Eight car demolition
[9040.54s -> 9046.42s]  derby and destroy your opponent's cars. Let's do it. Three two get an elderly actor.
[9048.02s -> 9070.14s]  Just let them fight each other. Oh no. Have hire an entire family. I already did that.
[9072.20s -> 9077.27s]  I already did that stream. You may not have been here when I did but I did that already.
[9077.99s -> 9088.07s]  Those of you that want some lore uh go to go type in the family dinner. German985 into like
[9088.07s -> 9096.31s]  YouTube or Google. I already did that and people hated it. People fucking hated that stream.
[9096.63s -> 9103.83s]  They were like it was so awkward and scary. I hated every second of it. The editor of that
[9103.83s -> 9110.86s]  video said that's my least favorite thing that I've ever done for the channel. I was like I'm
[9110.86s -> 9133.58s]  sorry. Oh my god dude. What the fuck? What are they all doing? They're all going after me.
[9134.38s -> 9147.42s]  I'm gonna explode. You have a money goal I have to hit? Yeah but these guys all have
[9147.42s -> 9166.34s]  additions to their car. This car sucks. This one sucks. Why are my ears ringing? Get me out of here.
[9166.82s -> 9198.82s]  Why are my ears ringing? All right so is it this one? Come on what is it? Is this what is
[9198.82s -> 9217.26s]  the heart? What is this? Oh um uh I think we're gonna walk by this one for now. Where's the
[9217.26s -> 9226.73s]  insurance fraud? All right if it's not this one then it's gonna do the brown emission. It's not
[9226.73s -> 9237.24s]  TOS. Yeah I escort activity to me feels like something I would need to be careful of on stream.
[9237.96s -> 9250.02s]  It's 1500 bucks? What? Oh okay there's somebody very very there's somebody in the car.
[9262.95s -> 9281.42s]  Don't crash. I'm trying not to. It sounds like the Macho Man Randy Savage videos where he's
[9281.42s -> 9307.29s]  breathing and just it's only the breaths that are edited. It's just like no Jesus god no 12
[9307.29s -> 9317.75s]  seconds please. 12 seconds please. It's enough to take me to the boiling point.
[9321.03s -> 9358.71s]  1500 dollars I'll take it. How come? Give me my money. What's it doing? This. It's like jeep. Hold on
[9358.71s -> 9372.79s]  stop. It's my favorite shitty rift. Anybody else have a favorite shitty default rift?
[9373.43s -> 9418.84s]  Shake it. Riff riff. Yeah whatever. You know what I meant. Okay right there. Let's go. There's
[9418.84s -> 9426.06s]  nobody driving that. Oh I was about to let go. There's nobody driving that. What's up?
[9427.02s -> 9465.35s]  That's not that one. Okay I'm so fucking done with this. I just it's the sex palace. I don't
[9465.35s -> 9484.34s]  want to go in there. All right you guys keep talking about this insurance fraud mission
[9484.34s -> 9498.47s]  but it's not on the map. Is it just is it rare? How rare is this? It's above the burger.
[9499.03s -> 9517.75s]  I could have pissed so bad. What's down here? I swear to fucking god arrest me. Just take me to
[9517.75s -> 9530.70s]  jail. Arrest me right now. I'll go to jail willingly. Please. I just almost I peed.
[9531.26s -> 9534.62s]  I actually that little drop of piss came out that scared the shit out of me.
[9534.62s -> 9537.58s]  There was no reason why I was going to get struck by lightning underground or anything.
[9537.58s -> 9561.43s]  I almost peed and I think I may have. It's not there. Off left island. How do I get here?
[9562.07s -> 9584.17s]  Is this like the prison? A power plant. Top right museum district. Okay right here.
[9584.17s -> 9599.46s]  This is really far away from where I am right now. I'm gonna take a pee break after this.
[9600.02s -> 9623.96s]  I'm not gonna do the mission. I'm just gonna get up there. Yeah why is it so bright? I want
[9623.96s -> 9643.13s]  a motorcycle. It'll be faster. Never mind because my gpu is fucked up. You should bottle and sell
[9643.13s -> 9670.90s]  your urine. You guys are actually fucking crazy. It's just a constant stream of just nonsense.
[9671.46s -> 9682.23s]  What have I done to you? Ah here it is. I'm gonna like once a week or something I'm gonna start
[9682.23s -> 9686.55s]  doing like math problems on stream. We're gonna talk about like logic problems. We're gonna talk
[9686.55s -> 9692.12s]  about like life skills. All I see over here now is like serial killer. Pee. Drink his pee. I'm
[9692.12s -> 9696.68s]  gonna drink his piss. I'm gonna put his piss in my mouth. Like I gotta like teach you guys stuff.
[9709.48s -> 9712.68s]  He pooped his diaper. But diaper poo poo. Like I gotta teach you guys some things.
[9716.58s -> 9719.94s]  But I don't think I can change the way an entire profession thinks about gender.
[9719.94s -> 9723.38s]  If I get in the brilliant book of world records for most patients served,
[9723.38s -> 9728.34s]  I think that would send a message that women are just as proficient if not more so than their male
[9728.34s -> 9733.88s]  counterparts. All right. Weren't you literally a teacher? Where are you going? No I literally
[9733.88s -> 9738.17s]  handed out worksheets and didn't know anything going on in the class. Oh no surgery takes a
[9738.17s -> 9743.05s]  lot of time. I need you to fake multiple injuries so I can treat you faster than I normally could.
[9743.05s -> 9745.61s]  It actually terrified me terrified me when a student had a question.
[9750.49s -> 9756.25s]  It was so sad and it was so wholesome. They come up they'd be like oh I need help with this one.
[9757.19s -> 9764.58s]  And I'd just be I feel like okay yeah I don't I don't know anything but you need help and I
[9764.58s -> 9771.02s]  want someone to be able to teach you and help you. And I think I would say you know how about you
[9771.02s -> 9776.14s]  try your best and try do what you can and when the teacher's back you'll be able to
[9776.14s -> 9786.55s]  go back and forth with the teacher. But how do I do it? Well I mean I I know but I want to make
[9786.55s -> 9791.99s]  sure that you know so you're prepared and I'm just here to make sure that you can figure it out on
[9791.99s -> 9802.01s]  your own. I didn't listen to a single thing in that cut scene so I'm just gonna go pee.
[9802.65s -> 9809.37s]  But anytime I'd say I'd hear the sound because I'd be looking down just gonna look at the desk and
[9810.09s -> 9814.18s]  shifting papers around pretending I was an important adult you'd hear the
[9816.22s -> 9820.95s]  of a chair moving back. I'd be sitting there going no no no no please don't come up here
[9820.95s -> 9824.55s]  please don't come up here and tell me how to do algebra or like how to do like long division
[9824.55s -> 9833.59s]  please god. And then then you'd hear a couple steps to the desk they're coming up here and
[9833.59s -> 9839.29s]  they're gonna ask a question please don't please please ask anything else. Uh can I go to the
[9839.29s -> 9844.97s]  bathroom? Yep oh absolutely I'll give you a hall pass for that. Come over here have a seat. Oh yeah
[9844.97s -> 9850.57s]  let me give it a big signature on it. Oh Mr. Albertson here it is take that. I am a teacher
[9850.57s -> 9856.38s]  go ahead. And you by the way you got five ten fifteen minutes whatever it takes go do what
[9856.38s -> 9863.67s]  you need to do I can sign that I'm an adult. And I felt great I was like thank god it wasn't a
[9863.67s -> 9879.80s]  question because you're just teaching a preschool. No I shouldn't teach at all. It was like a thing
[9879.80s -> 9882.92s]  that I did because I was just trying to do something like that I thought was interesting.
[9882.92s -> 9892.84s]  I was like oh that sounds like an interesting job. I mean I'll try that teach us something.
[9892.84s -> 9898.94s]  Okay I do teach you guys things all the time I think. I feel like you guys have taken some
[9898.94s -> 9903.94s]  things from this stream very important stuff. Of course you have. For instance one of the things
[9904.26s -> 9910.50s]  you take from the stream is that holding your urine is not good. Your teacher has peed his pants
[9910.50s -> 9917.05s]  like pee came out. So you take from the learning experience here you've learned that. That if you
[9917.05s -> 9921.29s]  need to go you should go and you should not waste any time just do it get up there and use the
[9921.29s -> 9945.13s]  bathroom. I'll be back. The game crashed. I don't know when I saved it but I think it was I think
[9945.13s -> 9968.02s]  it was pretty recently. I think we're fine I'll be back. I didn't pee my pants. I'm a comedian.
[9968.02s -> 9970.74s]  I'm a comedian. I tell jokes. That's what I do for a living. I'm a comedian.
[9971.62s -> 9977.78s]  Come see me at the fucking funny factory okay. I'm there every Friday. I hope that I don't I don't
[9977.78s -> 10193.00s]  actually do that goodbye. Kind of hot in this room right now. Teacher's gone for 15 minutes we can
[10193.00s -> 10213.98s]  leave. I wasn't gone for 15 minutes. I'm here. All jokes aside I hope I still saw Jermad do stand up
[10213.98s -> 10218.70s]  once. I went to the funny factory hoping to see my favorite streamer dish up some comedy. The entire
[10218.70s -> 10223.02s]  time he just wouldn't stop talking about his uh penis. I guess he kept saying it like that. Nobody
[10223.02s -> 10234.65s]  laughed. You know what you said there is is a sadly inaccurate because like jokes like oh my dick
[10234.65s -> 10241.93s]  oh my oh my dick. The audience will be rolling. Let me tell you guys something about my dick.
[10242.65s -> 10247.32s]  People just start laughing. We're just so much more high brow than that here.
[10257.08s -> 10273.38s]  I'm shitting and screaming. Yeah that's much higher. Higher. What was that? I just breathed
[10273.38s -> 10286.18s]  pretty hard out of my nose. I think you're right. Say happy birthday to uh some spinach.
[10286.18s -> 10291.64s]  Something spinach. Happy birthday spinach. All right let's go back to what we're doing.
[10291.64s -> 10300.92s]  We'll play some more Saints Row. By the way uh Sunday. Sunday is confirmed I'm playing uh
[10300.92s -> 10305.80s]  Resident Evil 6 co-op with Salix. We're not going to beat the game. We're going to play it until we
[10305.80s -> 10321.11s]  both complain enough that we both just leave. Are the course really? You know. You mind if I sleep?
[10321.11s -> 10325.91s]  No go for it. I apologize if I wake you up when I scream or laugh really loud at a car accident.
[10326.63s -> 10336.06s]  All right let's open the game back up. Which it crashed. Hopefully we didn't lose too much
[10336.06s -> 10347.43s]  progress. I don't think we did. Resident Evil 6 is so bad that it's a good game. Yeah I played
[10347.43s -> 10352.23s]  it once years ago. I was going to make a video on it but the game was so bad that I was like I
[10352.23s -> 10357.70s]  don't even care. I don't want to play more than 40 minutes but we're going to stomach through it.
[10357.70s -> 10374.94s]  We're going to force ourselves to do it. Uh good they're both exactly the same place. Um
[10374.94s -> 10376.86s]  might as well just go for it right. We're right here.
[10393.77s -> 10395.93s]  Insurance fraud oh you're right. I'll go back.
[10408.97s -> 10411.61s]  This mask is skin grafted onto my face.
[10411.85s -> 10422.87s]  You should upgrade your base.
[10436.39s -> 10449.43s]  I've been streaming for three hours. Wow that's surprising. I didn't want to hurt anybody.
[10452.73s -> 10454.73s]  Nothing. There's nothing on the radio.
[10454.73s -> 10469.61s]  What you did now. That was me humming the whole time.
[10470.25s -> 10485.78s]  Excuse me. Now what are you doing? Stop it. Don't don't make me do it.
[10486.82s -> 10489.78s]  Don't make I'm a pirate. I know I'm a pirate. Don't make me look at that thing you wrote in
[10489.78s -> 10494.02s]  chat. No what are you doing? Stop my Wellington. Stop that. What are you doing in my Wellington?
[10494.02s -> 10500.50s]  Stop it. You know everybody hates it. I do too. I'm so fucked up I have to say it though. I'm
[10500.50s -> 10508.63s]  a fucking goddamn. No what am I? I like impulsively have to do something that I see. What is it called?
[10509.43s -> 10534.25s]  A monkey? You're a sadist? All right we have to. Oh it's an earnest level threat. Orange threat
[10534.25s -> 10574.74s]  level is that what is that? Okay I see a guy like this walking around. I'm what the fuck is going
[10574.74s -> 10597.69s]  on? What the fuck? Jesus Christ. Eat eat eat eat eat eat drink eat eat eat something. Eat eat
[10597.69s -> 10609.05s]  something. Eat something. Eat something. What the fuck? I it's just shocking to me. I don't even
[10609.05s -> 10634.33s]  take a fucking anything. I can't even walk. I didn't god damn it. I didn't want to. I wanted
[10634.33s -> 10645.43s]  to right click. Right not. I wanted to right trigger. Oh my fucking god. I'm fucking leaving
[10645.43s -> 10666.79s]  this mission. Oh my god. Is it like body armor? Don't right. Don't left trigger. Please watch out.
[10667.43s -> 10693.27s]  Please. Yeah please watch out. Please god. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Please. Put you
[10693.27s -> 10710.36s]  motherfucker. Put down. Put him down. Put them down. Put them. I was trying to melee. I was
[10710.36s -> 10714.36s]  trying to melee. I was trying to melee. I was trying to melee. I was trying to melee. I was I
[10714.36s -> 10718.98s]  thought it was melee. I thought it was melee. Melee. Melee. I was trying to melee. Oh my god.
[10718.98s -> 10727.45s]  I was trying to melee. I thought it was melee. It's not. I'm so fucking sorry. I was trying to
[10727.45s -> 10749.38s]  do the melee attack. Get me out of here. Oh my god. I was trying to go up and do it. Where are
[10749.38s -> 10776.65s]  we? What? How are we driving around like this? Will you please get. Okay. All right. We got him.
[10776.65s -> 10783.32s]  No we didn't. This is going to explode. Isn't it? Don't worry. You're playing a game. I don't. I
[10783.32s -> 10796.89s]  don't want to die. I don't want to hurt anybody. We win. They're not real. I die. I don't hurt
[10796.89s -> 10813.53s]  anybody. He thinks it's real. It's not. Hello. What happened? You've run over probably 500 people.
[10813.53s -> 10824.09s]  Why do you. I went to the airport to save. I can't. Once I saw the leader of the saints making a move
[10824.09s -> 10830.36s]  towards the terminal. I made my way to the plane so I could evacuate your father. His entourage
[10830.36s -> 10837.96s]  willingly gave their lives to ensure safety. What happens when the matrix happens? No. Your
[10837.96s -> 10841.80s]  father made it quite clear he doesn't wish to speak to you. Anything you have to say to him
[10841.80s -> 10857.85s]  will go through me. Sayonara. Oh the fucking McRiddler. Yeah. The McRiddler is a fucking
[10857.85s -> 10886.25s]  menace. Jerma has overdosed on normal pills. What do you mean? What does that mean?
[10886.97s -> 10895.98s]  What does that mean? I don't even know what that means. The McRiddler is a terrorist. No.
[10895.98s -> 10902.23s]  The McRiddler is a chaotic good character. Okay. Like every other character that anyone has ever
[10902.23s -> 10907.67s]  made. Every single person's chaotic good. Nobody wants to be lawful good. Nobody wants to be lawful
[10907.67s -> 10911.27s]  neutral. Nobody wants to be neutral. Everybody's chaotic good. I'm chaotic good. I'm a good person
[10911.27s -> 10932.47s]  but I'm on my own rules and I'm kind of crazy and I do crazy things. Is this a customer? I was
[10932.47s -> 10948.31s]  waiting for him to get out of the way but I don't care. You're faithful to good boy. Yeah. Where is
[10948.31s -> 10961.54s]  this customer? Yeah good we went over this before. Good boy but a bad guy. You can be a bad guy and
[10961.54s -> 10983.75s]  a good boy and uh-uh. What's the difference? Slow and steady. Not this again please. How am I supposed
[10983.75s -> 10996.95s]  to get there in a minute? This is a this is ten dollars. Did you want to drive in a circle?
[11006.39s -> 11016.14s]  Hold on. I gotta read this. What are you saying? Remember the McRiddler was only chaotic good for
[11016.14s -> 11022.47s]  one writer's run back in 1972 to 1974 and it wasn't even that good. The definitive version of
[11022.47s -> 11028.39s]  this character has existed for over 50 years and no one agrees that a two-year run has any bearing
[11028.39s -> 11035.29s]  on who he was made to be okay? Just because your uncle wrote the run doesn't make it right. Oh
[11035.29s -> 11044.54s]  really? Uh so the Dark Knight trilogy considered to be the best run of Batman ever and we don't
[11044.86s -> 11057.06s]  say that though. Everything no. Everything else is is is the right one right? You're excused. Game
[11057.06s -> 11073.14s]  crashed. Good thing I saved it right there. I wonder how um the new Batman movie will be. I feel like
[11073.14s -> 11083.16s]  it's gonna be pretty good. I didn't watch Ernest Saves Christmas yet. Am I allowed to be here? You
[11083.16s -> 11098.87s]  have until the 25th. So you got plenty of time. The McRiddler is the worst of the rat man's rogues
[11098.87s -> 11116.15s]  gallery. Yeah you got plenty of time. You have the whole month of December. You're good but this
[11116.15s -> 11134.36s]  has something happening outside. All right insurance fraud right? Are these guys on my team?
[11140.18s -> 11161.67s]  Oh my Jesus Christ. Where are they going? Don't shoot the gun. Did I kill the guy in the front
[11161.67s -> 11172.42s]  seat? Oh wait they didn't see me steal this car. Does that mean that? Of course you did.
[11174.54s -> 11181.02s]  I didn't think I could roll up in the car they were just in as a guy that wasn't a police officer
[11181.10s -> 11185.02s]  and did what? They I I'm not gonna get in trouble for this. They don't know it was me.
[11185.74s -> 11198.34s]  What am I smoking? What's what am I talking about? All right where was that? I was over here.
[11198.34s -> 11206.57s]  Oh I'm just an officer except I'm the McRiddler. If the McRiddler pulls up in a cop car he took it.
[11206.57s -> 11213.30s]  He's not a police officer. All the normal pills. What are you talking about? Why you keep saying
[11213.30s -> 11234.70s]  that? Where's the insurance fraud? There's too many things on the map. It's the crutches right?
[11234.70s -> 11251.10s]  Where are they? Where are they? Museum district. Oh it's because okay it's because the game crashed
[11251.10s -> 11261.99s]  before it saved. I understand. What's this McDonald's car? What is this? Holy shit I want that.
[11262.63s -> 11271.10s]  The McRiddler has to have this car. This is I'm gonna I have to save this one.
[11272.57s -> 11291.05s]  Holy moly. I gotta go to a garage right now. Where's the nearest garage? Up here. What's
[11291.05s -> 11302.54s]  this place? Oh a penthouse loft? Where should I save it? I'm gonna buy this place whatever it is.
[11302.54s -> 11317.18s]  It's downtown left. Let's go. Don't mess this car up. Remember you're not a fan of the McRiddler
[11317.18s -> 11335.37s]  unless you know his whatever. That's really funny but I don't even want to read it. I swear to
[11335.37s -> 11342.14s]  god some of you guys are the funniest motherfuckers ever. Everyone talks about chat like oh chat's like
[11342.14s -> 11350.02s]  yeah fuck fuck chat chat's like oh fucked up I don't like it. A lot of you are right? But man
[11350.02s -> 11359.00s]  there's a huge percentage of you guys that are fucking absolutely hysterical. $50,000 god damn
[11359.00s -> 11368.62s]  it. I'm not going to tell you the the percentage that I think that is because I don't want you else
[11368.62s -> 11379.40s]  to get your egos inflated. I can't afford that. What can I afford? Can I afford this one? This is
[11379.40s -> 11408.50s]  a penthouse. I highly doubt that. We're just gonna bring it back here. No crashes at all please.
[11409.30s -> 11428.73s]  I really liked Nolan's Batman. Yeah okay on a rewatch recently it was like yeah this is still
[11428.73s -> 11454.42s]  really good. I have some issues with it. I think it's probably the best version of Batman although
[11454.42s -> 11457.54s]  I do like the Michael Keaton Batman. I think that was still really good too.
[11457.54s -> 11463.82s]  It's tough. Danny DeVito as the penguin is I don't think you can ever get something that's better.
[11474.84s -> 11500.02s]  Dude scratch this car. I scratch your life out. Just make sure you know that. Get out of the way.
[11500.02s -> 11518.87s]  I don't want you to don't smudge up the paint. All right we made it. Okay bring the car here
[11518.87s -> 11532.31s]  into the garage. Yes yes. So why am I zooming in there? I don't know. I did not mean to do that.
[11532.31s -> 11539.40s]  So will this always be here? Okay if this explodes outside somewhere will it still be in
[11539.40s -> 11550.97s]  this garage? Oh that's amazing. Thank god. That's incredible. All right so now let's go over here.
[11550.97s -> 11583.29s]  This way right? Yeah now I can just drive around like an asshole. Perfect. Geez it's fast. I'm
[11583.29s -> 11605.08s]  going through the bottom of the car. Saved. I just saved. I did didn't I? Hot dog Batmobile.
[11609.38s -> 11614.97s]  It's not even the right one. Wait it's not the destination never mind. Not the destination.
[11615.53s -> 11649.94s]  Clean. Very clean. Being chat spam a copy pasta.
[11651.90s -> 11655.14s]  Would you like to know the percentage of the funny people?
[11663.32s -> 11674.46s]  All right let's actually do this this time. I'm gonna fight to the death for the Hamburg Larini.
[11674.46s -> 11676.98s]  It's not bad.
[11690.92s -> 11695.88s]  Most patients served. I think that would send a message that women are just as proficient if
[11695.88s -> 11702.79s]  not more so than their male counterparts. All right. Where are you going? You said you were
[11702.79s -> 11706.31s]  planning on treating more patients so I figured you wanted me to hurt some people. Oh god no.
[11706.31s -> 11710.87s]  Surgery takes a lot of time. I need you to fake multiple injuries so I can treat you faster than
[11710.87s -> 11717.91s]  I normally could. Fake multiple injuries? Does that make sense? Just checking.
[11718.87s -> 11728.87s]  Throw yourself into harm's way to earn cash. Okay so just to beat myself up. Where's my car?
[11728.87s -> 11738.81s]  There it is. I keep hearing bottle rockets go off. Been like that the whole game. I haven't
[11738.81s -> 11775.32s]  ever mentioned it. Friendly. Friendly. Friendly. Friendly. Friendly. Friendly. To take a dive?
[11776.20s -> 11799.70s]  What does it what do you mean press? I have to press to take a dive. Oh shit this is time
[11799.70s -> 11816.39s]  limit. Okay so am I to do it now? Do it now. Do it now. I'm gonna go so fast I'm gonna go
[11816.39s -> 11849.40s]  right into a wall. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. That doesn't count? Why are we all doing the same thing?
[11856.89s -> 11883.26s]  Oh shit oh you you fall into stuff. I get it. Oh my god this is amazing. That's so stupid. What
[11883.26s -> 11906.31s]  about hold on. Nice. I got plenty of time. I have an idea. I'm gonna go in the supercar. I'm gonna
[11906.31s -> 11942.01s]  go a million miles per hour and throw myself out of the map. Does this count? Oh shit. That's
[11942.01s -> 11954.84s]  actually not a bad idea. I have to get some air though. How do I get air? That's a good question.
[11954.84s -> 11975.64s]  Shit. It's gonna be close. Come on get over here. I'm not gonna get it. I don't okay. Now I know
[11975.64s -> 11990.94s]  what they want me to do. I get it. I understand. You need to bounce off of cars. Okay well I didn't
[11990.94s -> 12003.86s]  get it. I'll try it again. I understand what they want. Okay all right. I need I want my good car.
[12003.86s -> 12030.84s]  This will do. The more hits you chain the more you get. How do you bounce from car to car? Drive
[12030.92s -> 12058.71s]  head into head on to a car. Will I fly out of the windshield? I think it's gonna start. You idiot.
[12058.71s -> 12084.36s]  You can move around while you're rag-dulled. Okay. Fuck. Motorcycle. That's better. That's a
[12084.36s -> 12109.62s]  good idea. That doesn't even do anything. Works better from near a fast road. I fucking can't do
[12109.62s -> 12138.58s]  this. Don't drive. That kind of worked. Just go to the highway. Will that be too far away? Stop
[12138.58s -> 12143.96s]  driving. But the cars are not going fast enough to make me do anything. Juggle yourself in an
[12143.96s -> 12151.91s]  intersection. Okay hold on. I gotta like get this down first. All right so there's a bunch of cars
[12151.91s -> 12174.65s]  here. Fucking god I jumped over it. How the fuck am I missing that? Come here. Oh come on. Oh this
[12174.65s -> 12193.30s]  is gonna be fun. I get it. I get it. Here we go. Here we go. Come on. These people need to get out
[12193.30s -> 12205.78s]  of the way. They're actually making them go crazy. This is actually good. This is good for me. Hey
[12205.78s -> 12234.30s]  what? I didn't count. How is this not counting? Oh you have to die first. Okay this intersection's
[12234.30s -> 12258.50s]  fucked up. There's no more cars. I need more spawns. Spawns come on. Oh hurry up you fucking
[12258.50s -> 12271.96s]  slow asshole. Go. Run. I didn't even. Hurry up and drive. Oh my god I'm not gonna do it am I?

[12295.93s -> 12315.86s]  it. Just go to the highway. Ignore the location. Where the fuck is this taking me? Where do I have
[12315.86s -> 12322.30s]  to go? The suburbs. Is there a highway that I can do that's right? I could do right here maybe.
[12322.30s -> 12334.78s]  Will this count? Any highway? It has to be in this location though. It can't be over here.
[12334.78s -> 12345.88s]  Jump off of a building. Wait I can do it right here? No I can't. Location doesn't matter. The timer's
[12345.88s -> 12354.74s]  not going. Yeah go to the city. What are you talking about? Go to the site. Chat. It's wrong. Again.

[13099.82s -> 13106.82s]  well if i can actually get the adrenaline built up it should be pretty easy the problem with the
[13106.82s -> 13111.40s]  last one was for a minute straight i was stuck in the intersection not being able to get a car
[13111.40s -> 13126.78s]  this time i'm gonna keep this car doesn't matter make sure you do nothing for two
[13126.78s -> 13135.34s]  minutes again no i know i don't want a car no i want a car to get to the adrenaline zone
[13135.90s -> 13138.38s]  then once i'm in the adrenaline zone i build up adrenaline and then we just go
[13140.10s -> 13145.78s]  so do not lose the car because if you get out of the car everybody i'm in the zone right now so
[13145.78s -> 13152.57s]  everybody's driving like a maniac you can't get another car i need to get to this place quickly
[13153.13s -> 13181.21s]  quickly there's one right here all right let's go run me over run me over run please
[13181.93s -> 13206.89s]  here we go you gotta wait till it's a big concentration like right here good almost
[13206.89s -> 13229.99s]  there i have three minutes to do this one more you need to move holy shit that guy just
[13232.95s -> 13258.78s]  oh the ambulance would have been huge oh yeah it's gonna explode i think it already did come here
[13258.78s -> 13295.99s]  this reminds me of a flat out one two stay on the roof huge oh this is huge this is huge at what
[13295.99s -> 13302.42s]  point do you stop the car i feel like i'm playing tony hawk i gotta get to a million points in one
[13302.42s -> 13337.42s]  combo oh 150 nice let's do it again clown prince of crime five minutes for 300 000 if we string
[13337.42s -> 13345.16s]  something like that together that's easy okay i'm just making sure that didn't hurt me in real life
[13345.16s -> 13351.00s]  again we get a car drive to that place build up the adrenaline and then go for it
[13357.24s -> 13362.12s]  motorcycle seems like the best idea because i can just fly off the bike and get an initial
[13363.08s -> 13387.48s]  how far away is this not that far okay go this just looks like a burger king or mcdonald's
[13387.48s -> 13394.18s]  character the big legs see if i turned around right now there's a gigantic face two circles
[13394.18s -> 13402.36s]  and one big smiley like the purple among us character and i'm not saying that to be like
[13402.36s -> 13406.76s]  funny and make a reference to among us i'm just trying to help you visualize what i'm talking
[13406.76s -> 13443.72s]  about okay there this is close i think yeah here it is bring it on come on what's with the spawn
[13443.72s -> 13476.18s]  bullshit this rng nonsense come on wasting time come on drive all right i got plenty of time

[14328.22s -> 14343.40s]  this i gotta go the other way on the highway i got a plan i have to get in the car and drive all the
[14343.40s -> 14368.52s]  way over there good i want to punch the algorithm in the face like spawn some cars i was running oh

[14487.78s -> 14497.69s]  new adrenaline zone they're like they're too far away the problem is the game spawns like 10 cars
[14497.69s -> 14512.18s]  in a row and then you just sit there for a minute game crashed i was saving it after every mission
[14512.18s -> 14538.39s]  though that's okay right it's okay right the bridges on the highway is the best place to do
[14538.39s -> 14560.63s]  it in the game uh this is accurate right just fuck the circle cars infinitely spawn on the highway
[14560.71s -> 14565.64s]  one problem with the highway is where's the entrance to the highway the gps in this game
[14565.64s -> 14569.40s]  literally may as well just be like a two-year-old yelling fucking their favorite song in the back
[14569.40s -> 14583.98s]  seat so the gps does not have any idea where to go where's the highway entrance yellow is the real
[14584.54s -> 14608.50s]  tracks this is a highway how do i get onto this oh my god uh i'm all right i'm gonna go do a mission

[16032.79s -> 16048.98s]  nobody move eating the shell is a delicacy we talked about this before i think but i gotta
[16048.98s -> 16054.71s]  make sure i get this in my brain reiterate it there was a gum that i don't know if i was lied to when
[16054.71s -> 16060.54s]  i was a little kid there was a gum that you were supposed to chew with the wrapper on because it
[16060.54s -> 16070.87s]  made it better am i crazy it was back in like the mid 90s i'm just gonna quit gaming for i'm
[16070.87s -> 16076.90s]  gonna quit i literally quit i'm crazy i quit streaming i quit forever like i need i've how
[16076.90s -> 16089.13s]  could that is it possible it's not even possible to do that as like a game or a live streamer
[16089.13s -> 16102.98s]  okay um where are we that was a myth but what was the gum it was a specific gum because it
[16102.98s -> 16108.22s]  had like little crystals in it i don't think it was stride if there was there were crystals
[16108.22s -> 16118.86s]  it was a little like flavor crystals not fruit stripe well i don't think it was an original
[16118.86s -> 16128.12s]  stride i don't think so it was flavor crystals and it wasn't stride hey i'll tell the story for the
[16128.12s -> 16134.50s]  new people what i used to um i thought that was too bad guys i used to lie to the dentist
[16134.50s -> 16142.65s]  and i was i thought i thought i was being really healthy and really really smart because nobody
[16142.65s -> 16146.25s]  who the fuck flosses right and they were like oh so you've been flossing yeah of course i have
[16146.25s -> 16151.42s]  also i've been chewing trident too this is a lie i don't even know why i said that because trident
[16151.42s -> 16156.49s]  ran these ads that made it seem like if you chewed trident gum it was good for you it was like you
[16156.49s -> 16163.75s]  cleaned your tooth and shit so i would tell the dentist that i've been chewing trident and they
[16163.75s -> 16180.94s]  go oh really wow yeah i'm just trying to be bad i'm trying to chew trident everything no not orbit
[16180.94s -> 16196.36s]  this is before orbit my brother used to give me shit for it all the time be like oh yeah i'm
[16196.36s -> 16202.38s]  chewing trident because he'd be in the other chair like it'd be like one chair in the other
[16202.38s -> 16210.12s]  chair that we were in the appointments at like the same time i just got ten thousand dollars for
[16210.12s -> 16230.90s]  that i know you should floss i'm just messing around i was ten grand damn do i have enough to
[16230.90s -> 16249.58s]  do the next one whatever this is i'm doing it is it icebreakers it might have been i'll give you
[16249.58s -> 16256.70s]  some more uh hints on what it could have been protect the oh this is in danger you're right
[16256.70s -> 16263.13s]  i'm gonna go do it let's get that guy back in here it was in it was not a gum that was in a box
[16263.69s -> 16270.52s]  or in one of those cans it was gum that was in individual little foil wrappers well but they
[16270.52s -> 16275.53s]  weren't foil it was paper and you were supposed to chew the paper too you weren't supposed to
[16275.53s -> 16294.73s]  eat it was i really just bullied yeah you chewed the paper and they just watched me do it and they
[16294.73s -> 16306.34s]  were like holy shit this kid is stupid i swear more people were doing that uh because i don't
[16306.34s -> 16315.80s]  want nothing i'm not doing the casino right now cineburst you're on the right track i think that
[16315.88s -> 16335.06s]  same era bazooka no that wasn't bazooka hear me you were probably the type of kid that put ketchup
[16335.06s -> 16347.69s]  on corn don't move and you'll be okay i'm not gonna hit the gas all right you're good why would
[16347.69s -> 16354.57s]  you put ketchup on corn what are you talking about that's disgusting why would you have your house
[16354.57s -> 16395.75s]  right here why is there a house right here okay and cineburst is the gum i you might think you're
[16395.75s -> 16400.92s]  probably on the right track i don't know if you're right but you i think you're close you're in the
[16400.92s -> 16411.26s]  same realm just put ketchup on broccoli i ketchup i don't really like on anything besides sometimes
[16411.26s -> 16417.61s]  a hamburger a lot of times french fries and that's kind of it like what else do you put
[16417.61s -> 16435.70s]  ketchup on besides a burger and fries what else do you use it for oh yeah chicken nuggets that's
[16435.70s -> 16450.94s]  another one grilled cheese yeah i could see that pizza no i don't think so meatloaf you're starting
[16450.94s -> 16468.23s]  to lose me replace that with gravy and we can be friends again those beachfront property over here
[16468.23s -> 16478.42s]  i want to take a look ketchup goes inside of a meatloaf you don't you don't like drizzle it on
[16478.42s -> 16504.66s]  top like chocolate syrup or something ketchup goes on shitty meatloaf oh auto burped in my face and
[16504.66s -> 16508.84s]  it tasted like a beyond burger and i could never eat beyond meat ever again i forgot to tell that
[16508.84s -> 16518.52s]  story okay so i was taking so auto sits on the couch we hang out he's like oh let's watch tv
[16519.40s -> 16525.90s]  and he falls asleep so i picked him up he like i kind of get him i cradle him he's really tired
[16525.90s -> 16529.34s]  and i bring him up to bed right like okay it's time let's bring him up to let's go to bed
[16529.98s -> 16535.18s]  so i cradle him i pick him up really gently i curl him over so his face is kind of i'm holding like
[16535.18s -> 16540.06s]  a baby and he's up looking at me with his face kind of pointing at me he's like eyes are a little
[16540.06s -> 16548.78s]  groggy right so i picked him up like okay let's go and at the same time i breathed in i was like
[16549.90s -> 16555.21s]  and he and blew his burp into my mouth and i inhaled it and it was the worst thing that's
[16555.21s -> 16561.93s]  ever happened i think in my whole life it was it i i almost puked instantly i was but i obviously
[16561.93s -> 16565.77s]  i don't want to like i want to make sure i hold him and i was like i don't want to you know cause
[16565.77s -> 16569.37s]  a problem so i was like holding him very very steadily but at the same time i was like oh my
[16569.37s -> 16574.73s]  god i'm gonna puke so i like got him up into i put him down in the bed and he was like nice and
[16574.73s -> 16580.57s]  comfortable and i almost puked like three times it was seriously it tasted and smelled like beyond
[16580.57s -> 16585.85s]  burgers and i love beyond burgers and it sucks because now i can like never eat it again because
[16585.85s -> 16591.99s]  that's all i'm gonna think about is my dog burping down into my lungs it's disgusting what is this
[16593.29s -> 16608.10s]  oh i just bought this it sucks because i said i really truly i love beyond burgers like i think
[16608.10s -> 16620.04s]  they're great oh nice 27 000 but something about the exact combination of the moment
[16620.60s -> 16625.24s]  maybe it was something that was in the air too i don't know i have no idea it was awful
[16625.88s -> 16641.13s]  how can i not buy that oh why does it put me so far away
[16654.34s -> 16659.54s]  i'm trying to eat stop don't you know this is a stream that you should never consume anything
[16659.54s -> 16666.65s]  while watching that's important to know unless it's like candy because who gives nothing is
[16666.65s -> 16671.26s]  going to gross you out from eating candy if you're eating a bowl of spaghetti yes but if you're
[16671.26s -> 16677.03s]  eating like a bag of m&m's then i could say anything and it wouldn't matter except for when
[16677.03s -> 16680.31s]  you're done eating the m&m's smell the bag and it smells like somebody's shit in your house 30
