[0.95s -> 6.94s]  Yeah, it was exactly on time. To the second. Right in the window, I'm telling you. I'm not
[6.94s -> 18.82s]  going to miss the window. My desk! This controller is so dirty. I want to kind of show this to you
[18.82s -> 23.99s]  guys. This is the controller I've been using the whole time. This is embarrassing though. I'm not
[23.99s -> 36.02s]  sure I wanted you to see this. This is disgusting. For some reason, I feel like this is going to
[36.02s -> 40.82s]  break terms of service. I feel like this is going to break terms of service. It's so gross.
[42.49s -> 56.18s]  This is the gamepad equivalent of showing like my asshole on stream. I need to clean this. This is
[56.18s -> 64.50s]  the problem. This is dirty key bindings. Dirty keys. Dirty buttons. This is filthy. This is the
[64.50s -> 76.12s]  reason why I couldn't beat the fucking guy last night. I don't have any alcohol wipes. No. I'm
[76.12s -> 87.00s]  going to furiously clean this at some point. But we're going to tonight try our our very hardest
[87.00s -> 94.63s]  then relax and try to get to the end of Sekiro tonight. I'm going to try as hard as I can.
[94.63s -> 101.66s]  I'm going to try to be laser lightning focused. Don't get mad this stream. That's well that's
[101.66s -> 118.09s]  asking a lot. Here comes rage. I haven't been raging. All right. I've been upset. There's a
[118.09s -> 139.58s]  difference. Yes you have. No I have not. There's a difference between agitated and rage. What about
[139.58s -> 144.62s]  the headless? Well that was that was another. I was going to a different dimension. That's not
[144.62s -> 151.67s]  anger. My soul got ripped out of my body and got put in a parallel universe. How am I supposed to
[151.67s -> 157.00s]  be mad at that? It just kind of was happening. Hysterical is a good way to put it. Yeah.
[162.18s -> 165.94s]  Jerma you've outpaced me so much. I haven't been able to even get to fountainhead palace yet.
[165.94s -> 176.18s]  Stop being good. No I'm just do it. Do it at your own pace. There's no there's no correct way.
[176.90s -> 180.97s]  Don't let anybody tell you. Don't let any like elitist video gamer tell you
[181.85s -> 185.29s]  that you're doing it wrong. You got to go faster. No do it at your own pace.
[186.25s -> 192.94s]  Don't have somebody go over your shoulder and go hey man you should be like you should have
[192.94s -> 208.79s]  killed that thing already. It's just a fly. Don't listen to them. This is a game that's meant to be
[208.79s -> 223.26s]  taken slow and seriously. Like for instance this guy beats Owl and Genichiro first try but dies
[223.26s -> 228.73s]  too headless and then they laughed three times. That's three separate laughs. That's all right
[228.73s -> 239.94s]  though. Skip everything. We spent a significant portion of last night's stream making sure that I
[239.94s -> 251.00s]  saw all the things that the game had to offer. I went back yesterday. I skipped. We went back for
[251.00s -> 259.78s]  like six hours to like do optional content. Oh you guys are just giving it to me right now.
[259.78s -> 263.94s]  And just wait till I get even angrier in about 30. I'm gonna I'm not gonna get angry today. I'm
[263.94s -> 270.23s]  gonna be positive today. We're just gonna talk about how positive everything is. It's gonna be
[270.23s -> 275.19s]  fantastic even if I die. Even if I look over here and I see people like making fun of me.
[275.19s -> 282.97s]  Which that's not very nice okay. It's not very nice when I see die to tutorial boss. I'm trying.
[283.53s -> 293.46s]  That's not a nice thing to see. I'm just kidding. Anyways let's uh let's go.
[294.10s -> 306.52s]  Moral of the story is you're not supposed to beat the game first try. You're supposed to persevere
[306.52s -> 314.42s]  and get ready and I already don't want to do this. I tried to talk myself up so much before the stream
[314.42s -> 318.10s]  started. I just already don't want to be here but we're gonna go. Here we go. Just I'm not
[318.10s -> 323.86s]  gonna stop anybody. By the way spoilers. This is a very very late game optional hard boss. If you
[323.86s -> 340.95s]  don't know what that is then I would look away. Why does it feel louder? Is it louder than anybody
[340.95s -> 354.39s]  else? It's really loud. Why? I didn't change anything. Oh it wasn't it wasn't even turned on.
[355.11s -> 364.62s]  Sorry about that. It's it is louder though. It is. It actually is louder.
[368.70s -> 424.42s]  Here we go. Not good. That was just like dust. Come here dog.
[425.22s -> 502.39s]  Watch that foot. Watch that foot. Okay fine fine fine fine. Watch out for the blast. Watch out
[502.39s -> 510.49s]  for the blast. Blast incoming. You guys never listened to me. I told you the blast was incoming.
[510.49s -> 546.86s]  All right shut up here. Not today. That's the best attempt I've ever had. Here we go. He's got the
[546.86s -> 556.62s]  he's got a new move right? I gotta I gotta jump. This is the one right? Does he do it now? I wonder.
[557.34s -> 593.74s]  Yep. Fuck. No I gotta go earlier than that. Go way earlier than that. There it goes. Right? Okay
[593.74s -> 601.10s]  let's see. One. Two. Is it just a good throw? Whoa that's new. I haven't seen him do that.
[602.30s -> 612.17s]  How long does that last for? Damn okay. That's the first time I've ever seen him do it.
[613.61s -> 630.18s]  He's gotta get out of the corner here. Get out of the corner. Come on.
[631.14s -> 637.37s]  This is such a bad spot. That's just not fair. He just stopped in the corner.
[638.57s -> 642.38s]  Like seriously I don't I like get out of the fucking corner.
[654.20s -> 662.70s]  He just stood there standing on the wall where the cliff is and here's the worst part about this.
[662.70s -> 670.76s]  If you get any distance at all with this motherfucker you're dead. So standing behind him
[671.56s -> 679.42s]  I'm just gonna go off the cliff. That was a really good first attempt until
[679.42s -> 710.33s]  I ran into the bullshit. He's already at an eight. Oh come on. What the hell was that?
[711.29s -> 774.01s]  Oh that didn't do that in a while. That just healed me. I didn't press that.
[829.82s -> 835.18s]  All right I hope you don't stand at the edge of a cliff for two minutes.
[836.38s -> 849.29s]  All right let's see if I can get this. I gotta go even earlier than that I think.
[851.53s -> 892.84s]  Side. Let's see. He like winds up. No you can't just run. I thought you could maybe I would
[892.84s -> 931.02s]  run it but it tracks you the whole time. Dirty control. Is it really the dirt?
[931.74s -> 966.76s]  Calm down Jeremy. I'm gonna get distance on me. All right here we go. Is he gonna do it?
[984.71s -> 1013.30s]  Phase three. Let's see it for the first time ever. Ever. Let's go. Phase three. Come on.
[1014.26s -> 1016.58s]  What is he doing? Phase three. Oh fuck.
[1019.96s -> 1037.62s]  Oh he did. He did. It's a. It's a. Whoa. It's a jump rope. I don't know. I guess.
[1038.34s -> 1052.04s]  Oh shit. I have such trouble with this. Wow it's a sweep. That was different the last time.
[1055.56s -> 1107.43s]  That's also different. No. No. Get up. Get up. Get up. I'm gonna take it. What the fuck dude.
[1114.97s -> 1134.62s]  What the. I don't know what he's doing. No. No. God. What the fuck. Oh my god.
[1139.59s -> 1142.87s]  There was a flame wall in front of me. I couldn't even go towards him.
[1150.95s -> 1156.74s]  The whistle didn't work. Maybe it was too close for me to be able to use it.
[1157.30s -> 1167.78s]  Man. Hold on. I need a second. Fuck. I'm so like. I'm so. Nervous up right now. Damn.
[1168.74s -> 1172.65s]  I wonder if I can. Is it might just. Maybe it's just cosmetic.
[1180.62s -> 1183.90s]  If I run through that I wonder how much damage you take. Or is it gonna knock you back?
[1186.09s -> 1196.87s]  I don't know. Oh that's. That's weird. Maybe I just have to run. He does that weird like
[1196.87s -> 1202.95s]  jump rope move. I don't. I maybe. It's. It's a. It looks like you just sweep it first and then I
[1202.95s -> 1243.43s]  fuck all know what the hell it means. All right let's go. Fuck. Nervous up. That's really the
[1243.43s -> 1282.18s]  only thing you gotta worry about here. Balls. You got out of that stunt quick. Again. See if I'm.
[1282.18s -> 1304.22s]  The reason I'm not healing is I'm trying to get a uh. See now. See I thought I had a second between
[1304.22s -> 1309.50s]  phase two and three. No. Not you. You. It's like an instant. So I can't do what I'm doing here.
[1310.70s -> 1329.34s]  I still don't understand how to get away from that. I still don't understand. I gotta figure
[1329.34s -> 1356.47s]  that one out. Otherwise it's gonna be the death of me. I still wouldn't. The only move in the
[1356.47s -> 1374.23s]  first two phases that I don't get. So I thought maybe you could jump over it and grab him.
[1375.43s -> 1381.90s]  Fuck man. I have no idea. I tried running. I tried jumping. I tried running directly away.
[1383.58s -> 1405.80s]  Maybe she's gonna. I just have to stay with him. Just fuck it. Just start to run up to him.
[1406.52s -> 1420.89s]  Just don't ever let him get that far away. That was. No. What? Too far away.
[1422.17s -> 1426.44s]  Too far away. At least I know that. That's why it didn't work last time.
[1427.24s -> 1434.74s]  I'm just like panicking and realizing that I just beat it. I just beat that.
[1435.46s -> 1445.40s]  Hold on. I need a second. I jumped over it. It landed and I like jumped. So I have to run to
[1445.40s -> 1481.85s]  the side and jump over it when it lands. Okay. Whoa. That was weird. That was really weird. I
[1481.85s -> 1493.32s]  like froze in the air. Oh fuck me man. I got it. I do. See if I can get it. Let's practice it.
[1493.32s -> 1515.94s]  Just like all time stuff. It's the worst part about this man. These fights take so long that
[1515.94s -> 1530.22s]  if you just get so tense. I gotta fucking relax. Or here we go. Okay. I'm gonna ring. He makes a
[1530.22s -> 1565.32s]  ring. Fuck. It's. Ring again. Oh now I'm in trouble. Now I'm in trouble. Oh god. He comes back the
[1565.32s -> 1581.45s]  other way. Through the fire. So on phase. Okay. Phase three. When he jumps away. He's either
[1581.45s -> 1595.34s]  gonna do like a barrage of meteors or a double slide. The double slide is. That usually happens
[1595.34s -> 1604.47s]  first. Meteor didn't happen till the second one. I don't know how random it is. Honestly I'm trying
[1604.47s -> 1606.95s]  to parry now. I'm trying to change things. Just kill me. Kill me. How am I gonna do it again?
[1607.91s -> 1612.31s]  Like I gotta. I gotta just do how I know. And not try to add things.
[1612.31s -> 1619.08s]  I got to the phase three pretty reliably there. I'm not. I'm not gonna do like. Oh let me try parrying
[1619.08s -> 1633.69s]  now. 25 attempts later. Like no. No. No. No. We're just gonna. He never reads useful shit.
[1634.73s -> 1639.10s]  Well I need to figure it out on my own. It's really easy for somebody to say hey go get this
[1639.10s -> 1643.74s]  item and beat him. But that's. Why would I know that? Unless I found it or hit it. You know what
[1643.74s -> 1656.73s]  I mean? I'm at the point of no like spoilers in chat. I want to beat him. That's. If I need it I'll
[1656.73s -> 1660.57s]  ask for it. If I. I can do it. I'm doing it. You've seen it. I'm in front of you right now.
[1661.37s -> 1689.22s]  I got it with like 30. 20 percent phase three. I got. I got it done again. Okay here we go.
[1690.02s -> 1744.15s]  I had it so close too. That's so unfortunate. But you gotta do what you gotta do. Oh he's of course
[1744.15s -> 1790.15s]  to go in the air again. Man come on. Great third swing. This is all you need.
[1816.26s -> 1856.28s]  Fuck. Oh that caught me. Didn't throw any missiles. What a fucker. Running out of these somehow.
[1864.12s -> 1873.18s]  Forgot about that. Okay here we go. Here it comes. Run. Okay it's right when it hits the ground.
[1874.14s -> 1900.49s]  Easy. No. What was wrong there? Fuck. I gotta go backwards with it.
[1902.25s -> 1937.70s]  Backwards. It's gotta be longer. It needs travel time. Otherwise you're gonna get hit by it. Stay back.
[1938.74s -> 1954.84s]  No. Why did I slide? Why would. Why did I slide? I tried to jump. What? I slid into a tree.
[1955.48s -> 2010.41s]  Here we go. All right. Don't slide into a tree this time. Thanks again.
[2021.34s -> 2027.58s]  Let's go. Phase three. Frank. Watch out. He's gonna do the thing. He's gonna.
[2028.86s -> 2051.10s]  I don't know. Fuck. Fuck me. Damn it. That fucking stupid swing.
[2065.85s -> 2077.05s]  Fuck. I don't know what it is. He's gonna throw. What? What? Why? I that's.
[2078.01s -> 2099.50s]  I did. I've done that the same way every time. Just run at him. Apparently. So running at him
[2099.50s -> 2113.54s]  every time he's ever thrown the meteors. I get insta-killed that time. I just run forward.
[2117.46s -> 2155.45s]  She's changing the speeds of how fast he throws them. Sometimes he throws in a fourth swing there
[2155.45s -> 2160.33s]  and it's impossible to know when he's gonna do it. It's just randomly he does a fourth swing.
[2161.85s -> 2165.69s]  I've not noticed a single reason why he does that. Sometimes it's three. Sometimes it's four.
[2167.85s -> 2251.83s]  Three. No. That's it. Three. Why? Why? I don't get it. First phase is easy now. Yeah.
[2254.22s -> 2275.64s]  Really it's the combo going from two to three. It hurts every time you do it.
[2276.84s -> 2292.25s]  Dodged into it. I gotta parry them. Oh no. Bad. Bad Jeremy. Bad Jeremy. Oh.
[2292.25s -> 2300.22s]  Oh. Make one fucking mistake. It's over in like a 15 minute boss fight.
[2305.82s -> 2309.42s]  One piece of human error just fucking ruins it all.
[2325.27s -> 2330.41s]  I'm getting closer when I don't get fucking caught up in the bullshit.
[2331.37s -> 2337.46s]  This first phase is I barely even have to use a fucking potion.
[2373.18s -> 2376.78s]  Get out of the corner here. It's a bad place for all of us.
[2377.50s -> 2469.74s]  Stop. No. Don't be stupid.
[2484.04s -> 2489.80s]  Caught in one move. You got. I gotta be. Excellent. Excellent. Let's go.
[2521.91s -> 2532.55s]  Fuck. So. Fuck me. Why? I was waiting for the fucking.
[2536.62s -> 2555.72s]  More perfect. No. All right. Is it gonna be the fucking meteors? No. It's this.
[2555.72s -> 2605.83s]  This is a huge wind up. Hey, come on. What's it gonna be? Meteors? Nope.
[2605.83s -> 2707.11s]  I gotta grab him too. I can't step sideways because the fucking fire. Oh my god.
[2714.41s -> 2756.95s]  Dude, what the fuck? It's instant. Jesus. What? The fucking hidden box was bullshit.
[2757.91s -> 2843.64s]  Daddy. What? He's gonna do it again? No. God. Why? Oh my god. You gotta be kidding me.
[2847.54s -> 2863.34s]  Oh no. Oh my god. So close again. When he gets the. When he. The. The. The. The.
[2863.34s -> 2871.90s]  Barrage. You can't run through him. You gotta dodge him. God. This guy sucks.
[2874.42s -> 2879.06s]  Ugh. If it just didn't take so long. It's like the longest fight in the whole game. Dude's got more
[2879.06s -> 2886.34s]  health than Medir. From fucking Dark Souls 3. With like four people in the party. Give me a break.
[2887.22s -> 2916.34s]  That was such a decent attempt too. Like I really had it. That was such a good attempt.
[2919.00s -> 2926.25s]  Jesus man. I got the mortal blade in my hands. You sure? Are you sure you didn't buy this from
[2926.25s -> 2930.41s]  the fucking party store? Because that's what it feels like when you play this game sometimes.
[2931.13s -> 2935.69s]  Is this. Are you sure this isn't the wooden trading sword from fucking Legend of Zelda?
[2943.50s -> 2948.30s]  You sure? This is the mortal blade. Just want to make sure you're aware of that secure.
[2948.30s -> 2954.10s]  I hope you have the right one. Not the eBay knockoff that you spent like fucking 39 dollars on.
[2974.79s -> 3015.03s]  If I heal in phase one it's pretty much over. You know. I don't know how that wasn't a dodge.
[3015.03s -> 3019.26s]  Is this the final boss? No. This is an optional boss.
[3021.42s -> 3023.74s]  Somewhere in the corner in the fucking world somewhere.
[3047.18s -> 3072.33s]  That was quick. That's the fastest you've ever done that. Go back to being a Fortnite stream.
[3080.46s -> 3088.25s]  If only. If only that's what I was doing right now. That was happening. But he's in a bad place.
[3090.17s -> 3166.04s]  I took the fucking god damn wall here. There's no. I can't run around in here. Stupid fucking boss.
[3166.04s -> 3173.10s]  From Software. I like the game you came up with here. Sekiro.
[3173.10s -> 3177.98s]  That'll die twice. It's a really interesting concept. A game that can only be completed by
[3177.98s -> 3186.57s]  a computer. It's like. You made it for AI. That's great. I like it. It's great.
[3187.85s -> 3194.22s]  From Software makes the first video game that is completable by artificial intelligence. They made
[3194.22s -> 3200.15s]  it for the robots. I guess the robots have taken over. They're already getting video games made
[3200.15s -> 3243.16s]  for. Sooner or later. You guys are watching me playing this game. No. You're going to be buying
[3243.16s -> 3248.52s]  games for your computer to play them. You're going to be like. Oh shit he just got him.
[3249.40s -> 3265.16s]  There's going to be lines of fucking code. You're going to be watching me watch a computer
[3265.16s -> 3297.26s]  beat this game. If I don't do it this time I'm going to. I'm going to go farm for resurrection.
[3298.38s -> 3308.55s]  Because I feel like I wouldn't have been able to do it by now. I know what the slide is.
[3309.51s -> 3323.94s]  I know it. I know that right. OK hold on. I'm pressing the left thumb stick again because
[3323.94s -> 3329.62s]  it's so intense running around. And we have four actions tied to the same button.
[3330.98s -> 3432.12s]  Whoa. I don't like where you are. Video games. Time for video games. All right now I'm pretty
[3432.12s -> 3548.01s]  quiet. Nobody talk. No. What the fuck. Here we go. What's it going to be. He's done it. I did it.
[3548.01s -> 3555.53s]  I'm a computer. I get to be a computer. I get to be a computer. I get to live my life as a computer
[3555.53s -> 3582.94s]  now. Oh that was fucking insane. The battle memory of an extraordinary foe lingering in the mind of
[3582.94s -> 3587.66s]  the wolf. Commune with the sculptors out and confront memories of battle. Yeah the one-armed
[3587.66s -> 3600.41s]  demon prowled the battlefield consumed by flames of deepest resentment. And a lapis. Was that
[3600.41s -> 3609.66s]  actually harder than an orphan. No. I said that last night that I think it was the same type of
[3609.66s -> 3618.14s]  issue that I had with orphan. I just think he has a lot of health. I just think he has a shit load
[3618.14s -> 3635.91s]  of health. And here's the thing. If you take the health down by like even 10 20 percent it actually
[3635.91s -> 3645.26s]  might ruin that encounter because here's the thing. I always I never really like phase encounters in
[3645.26s -> 3650.62s]  these games because you take you spend so much time trying to learn the new moves that they do
[3651.42s -> 3656.14s]  that you almost forget the old ones. That's what kind of happened in the three or four times I
[3656.14s -> 3662.38s]  saw phase three is I was so desperate to figure out and learn the new move that he gets that you
[3662.38s -> 3670.65s]  almost just fucking completely forget about the other first two phases. But I think it's by design
[3670.65s -> 3676.78s]  what there really only is about five moves that are just difficult to understand. And that's what
[3676.78s -> 3682.50s]  I'm saying people look when people were saying oh wait why are you not doing it like this. I'm
[3682.50s -> 3689.11s]  gonna I gotta figure it out you know I'm gonna just do it. You know I could I've made that
[3689.11s -> 3699.56s]  encounter way easier by going to get like item x maybe. We don't want to hear your life story.
[3701.72s -> 3714.84s]  What? I'm like defending myself. I got 15 000 fucking souls. Look I just beat one of the
[3714.84s -> 3719.99s]  hardest encounters in the whole game. I you know I can't. On to the next one immediately.
[3720.71s -> 3739.98s]  I can't sit here for fucking two minutes? Really? Really? One guy said that.
[3743.54s -> 3749.88s]  Any regular circumstance I would go fucking take a bath right now. In fact I might just have to
[3749.88s -> 3765.74s]  control her in my hand and be in the bath. Mob that guy. Come on like this is a fucking wildly
[3766.54s -> 3771.18s]  focused encounter. It's like a full almost five to ten minute straight boss fight.
[3771.18s -> 3775.02s]  I think I should be able to sit here for like a couple minutes and just talk.
[3783.48s -> 3788.25s]  The battle memory of an extraordinary foe. Okay a man who failed to become Shura instead became a
[3788.25s -> 3793.16s]  vessel for the flames of hatred. As fate would have it he was bound stubbornly to his world.
[3793.88s -> 3797.88s]  It wasn't until he became a demon that he was finally able to depart for the next.
[3801.69s -> 3811.18s]  Interesting. Why no face cam? I don't like face cam. I don't really do face cam if you're new.
[3813.21s -> 3833.26s]  Sealed shut why? All right so I did it. Now I have to go. I did the two snakes because there was a
[3833.26s -> 3839.03s]  giant fuck-off demon at the door. I guess that is why you would seal the door. He's wearing I'm not
[3839.03s -> 3842.71s]  wearing the same shirt again. I'm wearing a like workout shirt because I knew I was going to be
[3842.71s -> 3860.18s]  like freaking the fuck out and talking about like AI and shit. Um is this that lady? Is this the rice
[3860.18s -> 3864.10s]  lady?
[3864.18s -> 3870.79s]  You know don't you know who the one-armed demon was before?
[3873.10s -> 3882.57s]  See it might be better that way. What a fate to be set ablaze in the fires of hatred
[3883.37s -> 3891.13s]  and suffer eternally as a demon. You put an end to his misery. That's all it was.
[3893.77s -> 3901.70s]  Okay so the hatred he channeled has lost its vessel. The longer the fires of war rage on
[3902.34s -> 3912.60s]  or ash it that does not mean you should step into his place. Maybe if I bring him some sake.
[3915.30s -> 3928.22s]  He sure did love that. No more sculptor at the at the idol. All of a sudden I gotta fight this big
[3928.22s -> 3941.99s]  guy over here. Do you know who that was? Better that you don't. Knock one back for him. I will
[3941.99s -> 3953.18s]  right now. Pour out a monkey booze. He did like like he did like all the booze we brought on.
[3955.77s -> 3971.69s]  Interesting. Well that was fucking hard. That's the I'll be honest with you. That was the hardest
[3971.69s -> 3977.13s]  boss I think I've bought in a like From Software game. That's like maybe Orphan and well Madeir.
[3978.17s -> 3989.19s]  Madeir was just hell because it just took too long. I feel good though. I do feel very satisfied. My
[3989.19s -> 3999.98s]  soul was ripped apart. Is there anything else I can do here? I just walked off the edge. Thank
[3999.98s -> 4006.70s]  god there's like an idiot wall because I was just gonna walk this way. Prove you're not wearing the
[4006.70s -> 4013.61s]  same shirt. No I don't have to do that. I don't have to prove I'm not. I don't have to prove
[4013.61s -> 4021.58s]  anything. I think we go back to the estate. We have to go through the door right? Anything else
[4021.58s -> 4034.31s]  is probably something secret here. Let me go back to the idol. Wait hello. What do you got?
[4036.34s -> 4054.46s]  No I've already seen you. Two heavy coin purses. Computers don't wear clothes. How far am I? I'm
[4054.46s -> 4058.38s]  at the end of the game. So if you just popped in here to be like oh did he just get out.
[4059.34s -> 4063.18s]  You don't want to be here. I'm literally at like the final probably an hour or two of the game
[4073.74s -> 4079.35s]  and by hour or two I mean I'm probably gonna get my ass kicked for like at least two or three
[4079.35s -> 4086.60s]  hours but that's fine. I'm willing to go crazy. I'm gonna lose it. I barely started talking about
[4086.60s -> 4094.14s]  how computers are gonna take over and that's nothing. You ain't heard anything yet. Still
[4094.14s -> 4113.03s]  don't have one of those. What about skills? He still doesn't have the spear. No I'm not gonna
[4113.03s -> 4119.75s]  have it. I'll be the one guy that doesn't have the spear. That's fine. I don't care. It's not
[4119.75s -> 4125.42s]  necessary with a video game end game. All right what. Get that off the screen before somebody
[4125.42s -> 4141.34s]  screams at you. Okay so I have. Why is this not available? This I need that to get this.
[4143.75s -> 4155.91s]  Living force is through here which I'm gonna need this and that. I don't know what to do with these
[4155.91s -> 4172.82s]  points. Maybe the midair tool because we're at the very end of the game unless there's something I
[4172.82s -> 4189.75s]  really desperately am gonna need here. Midair combo maybe or vault over. Maybe midair combo.
[4189.75s -> 4199.06s]  I don't know but there's only like a couple maybe more of the emblems.
[4199.94s -> 4210.71s]  It's one. Yeah fuck it. But I feel like maybe that it's only one right. Is that gonna be enough for
[4210.71s -> 4229.13s]  me to. I can do both. Combo arts while in the air. I mean just if I. I feel like that it's
[4229.13s -> 4240.23s]  necessary at some point. And then shadow rush. So I need three more. Have I ever used a combo? Yeah
[4240.79s -> 4244.07s]  I use this thing pretty frequently. I use this pretty frequently.
[4244.07s -> 4247.67s]  Ever since I got it. I use it on. I don't use it on bosses though.
[4248.63s -> 4265.98s]  Oh a box. What the fuck is this? Phantom Gunai can be used to upgrade the loaded shuriken.
[4269.35s -> 4286.49s]  And I think I got. It's the spear. I got Luigi. How many prayer beads do I have? Come on where's
[4286.49s -> 4294.89s]  my prayer bead? I have like I need two more right. I have to pay money for the spear. What do I got
[4294.89s -> 4307.91s]  for cash? Let's see. I have no. How much do I got? I got thousand two thousand twenty one hundred.
[4309.11s -> 4331.98s]  Not enough. I could sell some stuff though. Dragon Rock cured. So I have zeroed for
[4333.90s -> 4341.10s]  the worst part. I feel like I've missed so many prayer beads. How you doing? You good?
[4343.03s -> 4360.65s]  I don't think there's any more business for you right now. Okay I think I'm ready. Let's continue.
[4367.72s -> 4372.84s]  Now where was it? It was not. Was it Kuro's room? No there was like a secret door or something right.
[4372.84s -> 4390.86s]  No no no it was the reservoir right. So I gotta go back to the reservoir. When you feel like you
[4390.86s -> 4394.94s]  missed something but you don't know what. Yeah it's always like that with these games though.
[4403.46s -> 4410.95s]  What do you have? I already bought it. Okay there's mask fragment two. Mask fragment one is over there.
[4410.95s -> 4418.33s]  Where's the other one? Five thousand dollars. Guys I'm not gonna buy that. May the departed
[4418.33s -> 4425.50s]  rest in peace. All right so we're gonna go back to the reservoir which was um is it this way or that
[4425.50s -> 4443.00s]  way? What's the mask for? I don't know. I also got two. I spent all that time getting the snake hearts
[4443.00s -> 4468.73s]  and I have no idea what those do. No this is wrong. This is the castle entrance. This is like the
[4468.73s -> 4480.55s]  giant moat. Why does the mox keep popping up on the screen man? The snake hearts are for a true
[4480.55s -> 4499.21s]  ending. Oh how do I do it? So then I can is it down here? It's this way. I think it's down here.
[4500.17s -> 4525.40s]  This is like the moat right. I gotta go down. Is this the right way? Um I don't think it is.
[4530.58s -> 4540.60s]  Is it? I need to get like a higher. I need to get a better view. I wonder if I can still get
[4540.60s -> 4568.01s]  there from here. LOL moments with Jerma985. No this is more desperately clinging to
[4568.89s -> 4578.63s]  trying to be good at a video game. Eight five. What? Oh they're just fighting.
[4580.23s -> 4624.15s]  No this is that's just where it was. I just I was just here. Stop caring. All right this is just a
[4624.15s -> 4628.15s]  mess. It's pretty this may this may as well just be dark so it's pretty bleak here.
[4628.79s -> 4637.05s]  No I don't even want to fight you guys. I just want to go to wherever I need to go.
[4638.41s -> 4640.73s]  It's like that beginning area of the game with a huge bridge.
[4641.61s -> 4689.77s]  Uh and I can't teleport here. Oh I think this is it. Is this it? You don't want to do that. That's
[4689.77s -> 4719.96s]  what I'm trying to stop. Oh fuck who's the boss? All right. Two at the same time. It's a backstab
[4720.36s -> 4744.07s]  but I guess okay well um come back. I have two. This is no way. Like I have to backstab one of
[4744.07s -> 4757.83s]  them. You know what I'm gonna try something. So that guy's turning though. Okay how do I fucking
[4757.83s -> 4800.57s]  jump on that guy? Do I just have to kick that guy's ass first as fast as I can? Let's fight him. Let's
[4800.57s -> 4818.55s]  go. You and me. He kind of just he just hit me. Okay I should probably back up a little.
[4819.43s -> 4827.32s]  He doesn't know which way to go. See? How much does this suck buddy? Doesn't it suck to have to
[4827.32s -> 4848.84s]  fight two people at the same time? Yeah it sucks doesn't it? Yeah you see it in real time how hard
[4848.84s -> 4882.22s]  it is. Come on. No that that whoops. Don't go into the fire. Don't go into the fire.
[4883.18s -> 4892.20s]  I don't know how hard this guy was. I mean yeah I did have I did have something helping me but
[4892.92s -> 4907.03s]  fairies. I remember that guy giving me so much trouble. Even uh yeah I did have a co-op partner
[4907.03s -> 4920.06s]  but still. You live? I tried to talk to him. He apparently didn't want to talk. Okay well I tried.
[4921.62s -> 4931.67s]  Uh I'm gonna just revive my shit because that guy's not gonna come back. One of them will but
[4932.31s -> 4940.78s]  it's fine. I don't care. I'm just gonna leave anyways. This looks like the correct way to go.
[4941.66s -> 4958.28s]  To the secret door and there's a new idol there but exploring this area is probably a good idea.
[4958.84s -> 4971.38s]  Oh no. Why? They make it look so it's so it's right there. It's just right there for you.
[4971.38s -> 4995.78s]  Waiting for you to do it. No apparently not. Now I can do it. Wow that in no way anyone can do that.
[4998.09s -> 5007.61s]  That's superhuman strength right there. Hell it's nothing else to do. I think I'm just gonna go.
[5008.81s -> 5022.09s]  He has a robot arm. I mean I guess so. He does have a robot arm. You're right. He is made out
[5022.09s -> 5028.38s]  of robotics. See he's fucking AI already taking over. I told you who they made this game for.
[5033.46s -> 5052.12s]  Uh what about up here? Nothing? No. All right here we go. Rest a bit. Secret passage key has
[5052.12s -> 5079.56s]  been used. Let's take it to the next area. Activate boomer bot. Okay. Is there a reason why every
[5079.56s -> 5085.32s]  FromSoftware game has an end zone like this? Dark Souls 3, Bloodborne.
[5093.80s -> 5101.62s]  This is lightning guy right? Oh shit I really did buy mine on eBay.
[5112.22s -> 5116.38s]  I have the real one. You bought the one on the convention floor.
[5120.20s -> 5124.28s]  No one has the right to the dragon's heritage. It is no one's to bear.
[5125.32s -> 5144.79s]  I wish there was another way. It's all right. We started here. We end here. We both have mortal
[5144.79s -> 5155.54s]  blades. Wait does that mean if I die then the game ends? Yes. Let's finish this. That seems kind of
[5155.54s -> 5158.58s]  weird. Wait but we both have mortal blades. I can't lose this fight.
[5165.56s -> 5171.21s]  You got a long wind-up time here. That's a thrust.
[5172.09s -> 5176.87s]  That's also a thrust. No it's not. What he just reversed my reversal?
[5177.83s -> 5184.07s]  Wait a minute. He reversed. I reversed you and you reversed me? That doesn't work. What?
[5216.25s -> 5220.97s]  What? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I'm dead. What? He can't reverse that?
[5225.67s -> 5243.61s]  Is that? That's a thrust. Was that a thrust? Well game over. I lose. Okay.
[5276.06s -> 5289.72s]  Wow I dodged it somehow. Okay he's gonna get his moveset down. It's hard to get a moveset down
[5289.72s -> 5305.54s]  when you die instantly. Okay here's the grab right? Coming up. I'm not sure I can block those.
[5312.17s -> 5328.52s]  That? No fuck. I'm against the wall here. I can't move. There we go.
[5336.39s -> 5344.50s]  It's hard to see through the grass. Like the high flower is making it hard to see what he's doing.
[5362.94s -> 5366.46s]  He changes it up a lot. He's got a sweep. He's got a thrust. He's gonna grab and he
[5366.86s -> 5372.86s]  there's different thrusts. He has two different thrusts. All right this is fun. Let's go.
[5385.51s -> 5412.10s]  No the sweep. I thought it was thrust. Fuck man. Heal. Sweep again. Jesus Christ. Oh my.
[5412.10s -> 5422.70s]  It's an instant. I'm dead. Instantly. Fuck me. Okay. I was thinking there.
[5423.66s -> 5438.65s]  I tried to jump but pressed two buttons at the same time. Jesus.
[5442.12s -> 5461.22s]  That move is the best time to get any games in. All right. Goodbye. Mortal blade. You got your
[5461.22s -> 5469.88s]  mortal blade taken from you. I'll take it. I can't wait for the centipede to blow out of the top of
[5469.88s -> 5482.98s]  his head. Right? That's definitely not the whole fight. He's gonna cut himself in half.
[5482.98s -> 5518.70s]  I was in there for so long.
[5520.06s -> 5533.94s]  Pitiful grandchild. It stinks in here. What? How? The person can't fit in there. Who the fuck? How
[5533.94s -> 5561.98s]  do you fit in there? What? He just like shed that guy. What the fuck? Ishi- Ishi- Ishi- Ishii was
[5561.98s -> 5616.23s]  dead. Three health bars. No. Easy now. Oh you're fast. And that's okay. That's a slash. One, two,
[5616.23s -> 5643.24s]  three. He's got a couple combos. Okay. Um. I gotta see as much of him as I can. What the fuck? Okay.
[5650.73s -> 5661.14s]  It's a long charge. I think he'd probably dash around it. I'm also just realizing something
[5661.14s -> 5670.30s]  really important. I gotta fight this dickhead every time. No. Do I have to fight Ginnituro again?
[5670.30s -> 5682.84s]  No. Like you haven't figured it out like after so long. Like I don't wanna fight these four people.
[5682.84s -> 5688.41s]  That's four health bars. Eventually this is gonna get to a point where this guy is not even a problem
[5688.41s -> 5719.58s]  anymore. It's just an annoyance. I got it. It's not even- It's four- It's a four health. Just think of
[5719.58s -> 5737.08s]  it as a four health bar fight with cutscenes in the middle. And we're gonna have- We're gonna- All
[5737.08s -> 5744.52s]  right. See. Uh. What time is it right now? It's like 5 30 pacific. All right. I'll see you at like 10
[5744.52s -> 5787.99s]  p.m. when I maybe eventually get this guy down to one bubble. Fuck. I thought I could get it right
[5787.99s -> 5807.16s]  there. It was sloppy. Bring on granddad. I don't know why I'm not watching the cutscene. All right.
[5807.32s -> 5820.33s]  All right. Here we go. Eight flasks. Sweep. Jesus Christ. Just give it to the bottle.
[5827.42s -> 5851.11s]  What the fuck is he doing? Damn it. I got it. Oh boy. He's gonna do it.
[5858.14s -> 5863.51s]  Come on. Let me get to phase two. Let me see it. I tried to. I'm an idiot.
[5864.23s -> 5880.12s]  Fuck me, man. Oh, I still got health. No. I don't- It's hard to tell sometimes if he's dead or not. He like
[5880.12s -> 5894.04s]  lies on the ground for something. It's too long. Sometimes you spend like an extra second like you do
[5894.04s -> 5916.26s]  like the- I died. I had like 0.2% health. Well, very obviously it was becoming very obvious.
[5917.14s -> 5921.94s]  This guy, you have to just go in. You see what happened that first thing when I was doing right
[5921.94s -> 5935.02s]  there? Not with you in particular. Now I'm just fucking being stupid. It happens. That happens
[5935.02s -> 5940.70s]  every single fucking time. I heal right when he's about to do that move. Just do it again.
[5941.42s -> 5958.46s]  That has happened every time. I heal. No, when he's going for the slash. He's reading my inputs.
[5959.10s -> 5971.27s]  The thing it seems with Isshin is his posture wasn't that great. If you stay up on him,
[5971.27s -> 5988.92s]  let me just get there. Speaking of posture, mine's pretty bad right now. Oh my god. Oh my god. What
[5988.92s -> 5997.99s]  am I doing? I beat it- I did it so easily like two tries ago and now he's just kicking the shit out
[5997.99s -> 6064.12s]  of me. What the fuck? My god. What the fuck? Why? I had it so- when I par- I deflect the fuck out of
[6064.12s -> 6078.09s]  him and my posture gets destroyed. I deflected almost every attack he did and my posture is gone.
[6086.92s -> 6133.83s]  I will restore Isshin to glory. Fuck. Now he- he ducks in the grass, man. Oh my fucking god.
[6135.11s -> 6149.98s]  Get out of here. Look like the real boss, you chump.
[6161.54s -> 6182.07s]  You gotta stay up on him. Damn it. Look at me. Look at his posture.
[6182.79s -> 6208.71s]  He's got a dash around it when he goes up in the air like that.
[6209.35s -> 6247.64s]  I tried. I tried to grab it. Slash. Fuck. Jesus, man.
[6252.38s -> 6257.02s]  He's so good. His moves are so hard to predict.
[6257.02s -> 6264.28s]  Holy shit, he's insane. And this is phase one. Oh my god.
[6264.28s -> 6282.79s]  I'm gonna need to deflect the first one. Good luck. Good luck. That's all, I'm dead.
[6291.59s -> 6310.65s]  You are in hell now. This took me 52 tries. See you in five hours. This took some people
[6310.65s -> 6331.50s]  six to seven hours to do. Holy shit. Wow, that's ridiculous.
[6337.40s -> 6357.56s]  All right. Wow, that's unbelievable. No, he does it every time. Jeremy, what are you doing?
[6357.56s -> 6367.85s]  He does it every time you eat. Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me. What? He's hiding. He's like
[6367.85s -> 6380.98s]  behind the fucking turd. He's on the fucking turd. Can this kill me? Like, that was fucking stupid.
[6380.98s -> 6404.70s]  I just got, I got LOS'd by the giant shit rock in the middle. I love when you username it
[6404.70s -> 6453.21s]  third person. I'm trying to tell myself to relax. Dude, how many, how many dings am I going to get
[6453.21s -> 6476.58s]  in a row? Jesus Christ, why? What is he doing? God. Ding, coming at you. Ding, coming at you.
[6476.58s -> 6479.62s]  Ding, this time I'm going to do it four times in a row. Oh, what the fuck?
[6480.50s -> 6492.68s]  His posture is nearly full. Yeah, but all it takes is for you to get hit once.
[6493.99s -> 6497.91s]  Sekiro. Shadows get hit two times and die. That's the new title of this game.
[6532.90s -> 6547.14s]  It's not even worth it to resurrect. It really isn't. If I, if you, because you have to fight
[6547.14s -> 6551.62s]  grandpa, you have to fight hyper grandpa with three fucking bars.
[6587.34s -> 6627.05s]  Why did I not? Fuck, really? Letting me hit you. All right, seer old granddad.
[6628.09s -> 6630.17s]  I didn't even know where he was. That was a weird camera.
[6630.17s -> 6655.66s]  Nope. Look at that posture damage I'm doing to him. It's not even, it's nothing. It's like touching.
[6655.66s -> 6690.23s]  I'm just like tapping him on the shoulder. What? Wow. That was a huge sweep. Wow. I tried to block
[6690.23s -> 6736.62s]  it. I did though. Thankfully. Oh fuck, no. God damn it. Oh my God. Die in one hit. It's a, I don't
[6736.62s -> 6740.06s]  even know, man. It's so hard. He puts the thing in the sheath and then who the fuck knows what he's
[6740.06s -> 6782.82s]  doing? Holy shit. You know, we talk about like people that will complete this game and somebody
[6782.82s -> 6788.68s]  said, who is this game for last night? I, I wonder what the steam achievements will be for us.
[6789.40s -> 6793.66s]  Or like somebody that was beating Isshin. I wonder how many people would stump it
[6793.66s -> 6835.42s]  and get this far. It's gotta be like 0.2%. What the hell are you doing? I thought it was,
[6836.14s -> 6879.42s]  it was a little early, but I still got it. God, grandpa. Is it a slash? Yep.
[6880.06s -> 6900.74s]  No, I don't even, man. It's so, he's such a variance in his move set.
[6901.94s -> 6905.62s]  It's almost like you can't even predict. You just gotta, you have to block everything he does. It's
[6905.62s -> 6911.22s]  hard to determine when he's gonna fucking do anything. We got no telegraphs really except
[6911.22s -> 6934.71s]  for the dings. God, man. No. All right, can I just like accept that he's better than me?
[6935.43s -> 6937.27s]  And we'll watch the YouTube video at the end of the game.
[6941.69s -> 6947.77s]  No, it's so fast, man. You don't even get a second to react to it. I gotta get like burned into my
[6947.77s -> 6976.12s]  brain. Holy fuck. God. In front of him? In front of him for that move maybe? I don't know. Maybe
[6976.12s -> 7015.98s]  he's standing in front of him. What? No, I thought it was gonna get a ding. Just don't get hit. You
[7016.06s -> 7025.70s]  underestimate how hard this is. Let me get some shit here. I don't really want to use anything
[7026.26s -> 7038.70s]  until I have, I'll get this off the bar. I don't really want to use sugars until I can reliably
[7038.70s -> 7045.93s]  get them at least down to like the first phase. I'll get them on the bar just to have them, but
[7046.57s -> 7063.35s]  I only have three. How many do I have in storage? Eleven. Play the inspiration music? Oh, we're not
[7063.35s -> 7071.67s]  ready for that yet. I can't even get this guy past the first bubble. Yeah, I'm not going to use any
[7071.67s -> 7081.85s]  of these until I can reliably get him to at least pass first to second phase. I have no more spirit
[7081.85s -> 7102.70s]  emblems. Oh wow, that's bad. Well, there goes my whole shit moment. I'll be honest, I think I have
[7102.70s -> 7107.98s]  to take a break. The demon of hatred was so un-fucking-bearable that I think I have to
[7107.98s -> 7116.58s]  take a break and like come back in like 15 minutes or something and do it. Like just, just chill for
[7116.58s -> 7136.23s]  like 10 minutes. Though these two back to back is like no way. Not gonna happen. I'll try it one
[7136.23s -> 7165.67s]  more time and then I'm gonna need like spirit emblems. This is gonna be a nightmare. I thought,
[7165.67s -> 7173.13s]  wow, I thought I was in the right. Did it hit me with the handle? It hit me in the head with the
[7173.13s -> 7217.24s]  handle. Posture is gone. No one can come. No, man. Posture, please. I'm so sweaty right now too.
[7217.24s -> 7236.04s]  This is like, this is the hardest work that I've had in like three years. Your posture will break
[7236.04s -> 7244.36s]  if you miss a parry. You know how hard it is to block a parry every move? That's like unreliable.
[7245.32s -> 7266.49s]  I'm trying to parry these guys. It's just so awkward. He hesitates on half of them.
[7268.49s -> 7292.52s]  Fat tracking. No, I thought it was this big sweep. Oh my fucking god. Not even scratched on him by the way.
[7298.42s -> 7301.94s]  No, I thought he was putting it in the sheath. I thought he was going right in the sheath.
[7305.66s -> 7331.62s]  Now I'm dead. And I can't even second.
[7338.52s -> 7356.89s]  Fuck. One bubble. Let's see phase two. Let's just look at it. Let me just see it and then I'll watch
[7356.89s -> 7371.22s]  the rest on YouTube. I'll watch the rest of this on YouTube. What happened? He has a gun.
[7372.02s -> 7378.86s]  He's got a gun. He has a different weapon. They already did this in the last game.
[7379.82s -> 7422.65s]  I'm just gonna use the fucking turd rocket. Christ. He pulled out a gun. Whatever.
[7423.61s -> 7430.34s]  That's ridiculous, man. Oh my goodness gracious. This is fucking wild.
[7431.30s -> 7434.50s]  They know how fucking around these last few encounters. Especially like these last two.
[7435.30s -> 7438.20s]  They were just like, yeah, you know, you like thought things were hard, but
[7439.48s -> 7443.46s]  we're on like AI level of difficulty now. Just kill me.
[7456.20s -> 7461.08s]  All right. Last. Last. Last time. Last attempt. And then I'm gonna.
[7461.72s -> 7465.24s]  I'm just gonna fucking stare at the screen for five minutes. I don't even know what to do.
[7465.96s -> 7476.49s]  I wish I didn't have to do this.
[7481.83s -> 7488.95s]  Uh, and you come on. I'm like, you come here with the fucking last little bit of that.
[7489.51s -> 7491.75s]  All right. I gotta take a break. This is insanity.
[7492.71s -> 7504.57s]  I'll be back in like two minutes. I'm just gonna. I'm gonna go walk around for water in my face.
[7505.37s -> 7633.43s]  I'll be right back. I haven't had any pause in the game. I have to just memorize everything.
[7633.99s -> 7644.22s]  I have to play space channel five with a sword. Left, right, left, right, chew, chew, chew, up,
[7644.22s -> 7679.61s]  up, honda, honda, honda, chew, honda, store. Oh, he got me with that. I get out of here. My posture.
[7680.25s -> 7688.17s]  Oh my God. I was trying to be tracking from dark souls two.
[7688.17s -> 7732.81s]  Dark souls two is he's gone. No, I think that he thinks he's going to keep going around.
[7733.93s -> 7737.53s]  He does that big long. He does a big long.
[7739.88s -> 7760.70s]  We'll talk about it after I die in like 30 seconds. Let's try it again.
[7775.58s -> 7779.18s]  Look at this posture already.
[7779.90s -> 7790.28s]  Oh, Jesus fucking Christ, man.
[7795.18s -> 7804.20s]  No, it's a. I don't even know why they have healing boards for this fight.
[7808.47s -> 7843.78s]  You don't have an opportunity to do it. Damn it. No, I just didn't know. He's back.
[7852.07s -> 7878.52s]  Hesitation is defeat. Hesitation is defeat. But Sekiro.
[7879.32s -> 7885.00s]  Hesitation is defeat. But sorry, you haven't memorized every single animation the developers
[7885.00s -> 7929.80s]  have made. Sekiro, why didn't you memorize every move I do? I didn't even get to respond before
[7929.80s -> 7956.26s]  he started that animation. Young Sekiro, don't let me hit you. Forehead.
[7975.72s -> 7996.22s]  Stop hesitating.
[7998.54s -> 8004.98s]  This is so ridiculous. This is a case study. They got hired by like the government to make
[8004.98s -> 8057.53s]  this game. This is like a government project. What if he's fucking with you? Hesitate before
[8057.53s -> 8075.48s]  doing anything. Maybe let's just run the fuck away. You know what I mean?
[8095.29s -> 8101.74s]  Oh no, it was. I thought it was the big one. Is there any way to tell? Because seriously,
[8101.74s -> 8109.34s]  he puts the sheath in and oh, is it a sweep or is it the big one? You got that like 10th of a
[8109.34s -> 8117.61s]  fucking second to react to these things. Like in human reaction time. It's just what the fuck?
[8118.97s -> 8135.99s]  It's because it's human reaction time. That's what I went so wrong.
[8136.87s -> 8159.16s]  That's how you do it. No, but that's that's this one. See, it's so weird. I thought it was done.
[8159.80s -> 8194.23s]  Can't. The heal is like a is a vulnerability. It's like hard to get yourself out of that mindset
[8194.23s -> 8279.91s]  where don't ask me. I'm trying guys. It's sloppy. What? No. Oh, yeah. Could have blocked it. Yeah,
[8279.91s -> 8286.78s]  but here's the thing. They put in this rock, paper, scissor gameplay that I'm like waiting
[8286.78s -> 8291.02s]  to see that emblem because I can't. I have to do the whatever I have to the technique is to get
[8291.02s -> 8295.66s]  away from it. So when he goes down here, I come for a sweep. Nope, no, no, no, no. It's just regular
[8295.66s -> 8313.62s]  text. It's just like fuck, man. Makes it so much harder. Like, see, he did the sweep at that same
[8313.62s -> 8340.74s]  thing last time. And it wasn't that you know, like he ducked down and did hurt. But this time,
[8340.74s -> 8354.78s]  the indicator popped up. He did that before and he went into a combo kind of win the lottery with
[8354.78s -> 8383.08s]  the number of scratch tickets. I didn't get any of those. I'm just hesitating now. I'm
[8383.88s -> 8405.32s]  just getting exhausted. Fucking playing this. I thought he was gonna
[8406.12s -> 8428.68s]  can't jump over that. Trying to test it if I could. See, my reaction time is just dwindled
[8429.48s -> 8444.01s]  from doing this for so long in a row. No, I don't have the demon thing on anymore. I crushed it.
[8444.65s -> 8455.02s]  This took me five hours to beat somebody said.
[8459.70s -> 8461.94s]  That's why I'm telling you this is a government experiment.
[8462.26s -> 8475.66s]  Okay, he's still got that. I think I'm gonna go get spirit emblems and just take a second
[8475.66s -> 8480.86s]  because when you do it so many times in a row, you just, it's everything's blend together and
[8480.86s -> 8509.58s]  it becomes impossible. Yeah, I'm lost. I've drained every ounce of my energy at the demon
[8509.58s -> 8514.14s]  fucking hatred. And now I'm just like fucking on fumes right now fighting this.
[8527.30s -> 8545.50s]  I need like a second wind or something, man. Give me like a second wind.
[8547.50s -> 8554.65s]  Inject caffeine directly into your bloodstream. I don't know if that's a good idea.
[8555.13s -> 8594.04s]  Oh no, I thought I could, I thought it was a big circle around you.
[8597.70s -> 8617.77s]  You can parry it, but I just wish I could fight him and not have to go through the first guy
[8617.77s -> 8625.05s]  every time. This is like, the phase two is like fucking 10 times worse than this shit.
[8639.77s -> 8644.01s]  The first guy's a weakling. Yeah, I know he is. But remember what I just said about how
[8644.01s -> 8648.49s]  doing the same thing over and over again, your brain just starts to hate it. Like I don't want
[8648.49s -> 8657.18s]  to fight Genichiro every time. I already killed him. Start me like right when the grandfather
[8657.18s -> 8673.48s]  cutscene happens. We don't have to do this again. It's reaching a seven. Oh shit, it is frustrating.
[8684.22s -> 8703.93s]  He said a nine. Well, this is the last boss in the whole game. So I mean, like, of course,
[8704.73s -> 8708.89s]  of course with their computer, they wanted to make the encounter fucking like
[8708.89s -> 8714.25s]  2% of every player will ever beat it. That's fine. I'm going to try to be one of like the 3%
[8714.25s -> 8736.18s]  of every human who's purchased this game to beat it. I have to actually like go get spirit
[8736.18s -> 8741.22s]  emblems or something. This is all blended into my brain. Like everything's the same. Everything,
[8741.22s -> 8745.22s]  the whole world is going together. Every color, every flower is turning into the same flower.
[8746.02s -> 8794.95s]  All right. Don't I have a thing? There it is, right? Now this kills me. Where's the thing that I can
[8794.95s -> 8828.57s]  give myself spirit emblems? Is it a combat art or what? Ceremonial tanto. I only have three of them.
[8828.57s -> 8845.19s]  I mean, what? Plus five. That doesn't seem like very much. I only, I can only use once per life.
[8845.91s -> 8862.95s]  I guess I could buy them too. How much money? How much do they cost? 50 for one. Well,
[8862.95s -> 8883.32s]  what else am I going to spend my money on, right? 500 coins is 10. What's, what's the point of this
[8883.32s -> 8911.27s]  even being in the game? This is like 500 bucks. No, I'd rather just go grind the money. Yeah,
[8911.27s -> 8914.23s]  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm taking a break from this shit. I'm going to go do something else.
[8915.85s -> 8931.45s]  Fuck this final encounter. I know there was a couple of mini bosses I could fight.
[8936.70s -> 8944.95s]  There's still like two or three. Are there any more bosses left? No, this is the last one.
[8944.95s -> 8968.49s]  There was something here. This is with the stealth section, right? In the manor? How many prayer
[8968.49s -> 8984.07s]  beats do you have? I couldn't do this with at least eight. Um, let me see. Where are they here? One,
[8984.07s -> 9003.72s]  two, three, four, five, six. I have six. Am I under postured? You don't need eight.
[9010.73s -> 9018.66s]  Uh, I feel like I'm just delaying the inevitable. I'm missing a, a gourd too, somehow. There's no way
[9018.66s -> 9032.39s]  this game has nine gourds, right? I missed one somewhere. There is 10. Yeah, I would assume.
[9032.39s -> 9053.24s]  Um, yeah, gourds really don't matter. That's true. It really is true. Like healing is, I,
[9053.24s -> 9060.23s]  when I die, I have like seven or eight healing gourds. You just have to, you gotta be like on
[9060.23s -> 9113.74s]  point. See, like I have nine healing gourds.
[9181.35s -> 9208.23s]  Fuck! I thought I had a second. Take a heal! Why am I crouching? Crouching! Here we go.
[9212.47s -> 9214.15s]  Good luck. For a second time, I've seen it.
[9214.15s -> 9333.82s]  And it thrusts right after him. What the fuck is this? The amount of effort it takes to get there.
[9334.62s -> 9339.54s]  Is like, I, I can like build up some strength for like one or two attempts.
[9340.34s -> 9350.70s]  The second phase is like, don't parry him. I'm just gonna dodge around. Right? Like, I mean,
[9350.70s -> 9356.26s]  maybe? I don't know. I feel, I feel like I'm confused to help do that second phase.
[9357.22s -> 9383.59s]  Okay. Remember, just reflect the bullets.
[9403.27s -> 9408.15s]  Come on, man. Just die. I don't even know how he hit me with that.
[9450.58s -> 9491.61s]  Wrong. I have a fucking bunch of dumb fucking moves. Swing 400 times. From something ashy him.
[9493.53s -> 9503.13s]  Oh, you go from such a different rhythm. Painful.
[9561.46s -> 9563.30s]  I thought it was the thrust, but it wasn't.
[9563.30s -> 9603.61s]  All right, two. I'm just gonna take it. Let's try some dodging.
[9627.66s -> 9657.80s]  No way. No way. No fucking way, man. No. No, no, no, no.
[9695.72s -> 9701.80s]  How many attacks do you have in that sequence? It's almost like you're not even attacking.
[9701.80s -> 9740.14s]  Shit's just happening around you. I don't even get a chance, even with a parry.
[9744.07s -> 9799.86s]  I'm trying to run, but of course, stuck on the wall. Of course. I, I'll tell you. So it's,
[9799.86s -> 9805.13s]  the dodge button is the McCurry counter, right? So anytime someone says, why are you dodging
[9805.13s -> 9810.26s]  into him? Don't dodge into him. I'm trying to do the McCurry, but dodge is also on that button.
[9812.89s -> 9828.06s]  So it just, it happens. Dodge is this button. McCurry counter is also this button. So I'm not
[9828.06s -> 9839.37s]  trying to dodge into him. It's just happening because it's the same button. And yeah, the time
[9839.37s -> 9843.91s]  is probably off, but that's people looking at it and they go, what the hell is he doing?
[9844.87s -> 9890.06s]  That's close. I already fucked it up. I wouldn't be surprised if I died more here than I have in
[9890.06s -> 9894.86s]  the entire game. Like how many times, how many, okay, how many deaths for the whole entire
[9894.86s -> 9913.03s]  experience? Like a hundred times? Do we even have a counter? I'm looking at chat right now. This is
[9913.03s -> 9945.03s]  a mistake.
[9966.86s -> 9977.74s]  Parried it already, but oh, it's so frustrating. Fuck me.
[10006.57s -> 10007.53s]  Oh, you crap.
[10007.53s -> 10017.26s]  Maybe you'll restore Ashina to glory. I don't think he will though. We've had this conversation
[10017.26s -> 10023.50s]  over and over and over again. I keep killing you, but yeah, here we are. I have to see your face
[10023.50s -> 10051.96s]  again. It's great. I love it. He restored Ashina to glory this time and what's going to happen
[10051.96s -> 10061.34s]  this time? Maybe I'll prevent him from restoring Ashina to glory. Let's do it again on boss before
[10061.34s -> 10137.02s]  the boss. See you next time. Whoops. No, my reaction times is zero. This is it.
[10137.66s -> 10144.71s]  I'm gonna, I'm gonna play a different game for like an hour or so. And I am at, I am at a two
[10144.71s -> 10170.10s]  for reaction time right now. Damn it. Lentless. I wish there was a stamina bar in this game.
[10170.90s -> 10175.13s]  I'm able to manage half these motherfuckers better than I can now.
[10191.67s -> 10195.11s]  Pull me out of your neck. I'll fight this whippersnapper for you.
[10199.58s -> 10201.90s]  Let me just reach into my neck and see what I got here.
[10251.98s -> 10263.42s]  This young secco though, try me again in the second phase. Let's do it son.
[10287.77s -> 10290.57s]  Even the fucking parry is ridiculous.
[10324.15s -> 10354.44s]  Let me get a follow-up there. No follow-ups allowed. Huge move. No follow-up. No, it takes
[10354.44s -> 10360.60s]  too long. Parrying any of his moves with the spear, you can't do a follow-up. It just does
[10360.60s -> 10374.12s]  posture damage to you. That's all it does. Fight! I just barely can get one. See what I'm saying?
[10374.36s -> 10375.72s]  I can't. You gotta get the fuck out of there.
[10387.00s -> 10393.78s]  I'm so fucked. No, no, no. I just can't.
[10428.46s -> 10450.97s]  Didn't make a fucking break. Give me like a fucking break. And I didn't catch that one.
[10452.49s -> 10458.84s]  What the fuck is happening man?
[10458.84s -> 10490.54s]  Isn't this supposed to be a stealth game? Yeah, I guess. He's already starting with that shit.
[10493.03s -> 10510.39s]  So if you heal, you're dead. They have a way to- every time.
[10514.90s -> 10531.66s]  I thought it was the- this is next level. It really is.
[10532.54s -> 10567.56s]  Uh, prosthetics? I have to grind for spirit ammo.
[10597.93s -> 10600.57s]  Okay, I can tell you something. I parried like
[10601.69s -> 10607.08s]  98% of every single move. And like still, this motherfucker is still gone.
[10656.15s -> 10674.78s]  Fuck. Let's see.
[10674.78s -> 10702.18s]  That was not it. I would have caught it. It just was so slow. And that's it. You make one mistake,
[10702.74s -> 10740.18s]  strike the whole fucking thing over. Um, this is great. Wow, he's already up here. Fuck. Not
[10740.18s -> 10830.98s]  dealing with that. Shit in my face. Back it up. Where- oh, I'm on the fucking end of the bridge.
[10831.94s -> 10834.94s]  No, no, nope, nope, nope.
[10872.71s -> 10926.73s]  Wait. No, I need to see phase three, motherfucker. Phase three. Oh, this is going to be horrible.
[10927.61s -> 10937.08s]  What does he do? Wow, it's lightning. What the fuck? Just lightning to strike random places?
[10938.04s -> 10960.22s]  Oh no. All right, I'm gonna beat this motherfucker. This guy's dead. I'm gonna beat this.
[10961.45s -> 10969.19s]  I'm going for it. I can do it. I'm gonna beat him. I'm gonna beat this guy. I'm gonna do it.
[10969.75s -> 10977.05s]  I'm gonna- I'm gonna have to get some fucking Durango juice or something. I'm gonna get like
[10977.05s -> 11031.46s]  an apple juice. Bring it on. Let's go. I'm ready. No.
[11048.33s -> 11066.84s]  Fuckin' let him fuck you up.
[11082.76s -> 11084.28s]  Posture. Bad.
[11141.62s -> 11144.74s]  No, I tried to do it. I tried to do it. I tried to do it. I tried to do it. I tried to do it.
[11145.62s -> 11190.49s]  Oh fuck, I forgot he did that shit. Out. Bye. Jump.
[11233.10s -> 11258.30s]  No, fuck, fuck, fuck. I thought it was fucking dive. No, it wasn't. I thought I had- I tried
[11258.30s -> 11272.46s]  to do the fucking Makiri. Just to- it was too- I saw it. I tried. That's so slow. The delay on
[11272.46s -> 11282.44s]  something scared me so much. Un-fucking-bearable. Sometimes he's just like, what? Never comes.
[11338.50s -> 11353.56s]  No! Holy shit, I made it. I was sloppy as hell, but all right, come on, old man.
[11373.18s -> 11373.82s]  Caught me there.
[11374.54s -> 11382.20s]  Whoa, that was bad.
[11420.31s -> 11420.95s]  Didn't get that.
[11426.39s -> 11435.58s]  No, god damn it. Give me a fucking break. That was horse shit. Oh my god. One mistake.
[11437.10s -> 11444.74s]  Just don't make a mistake, bro. 12 minute boss fight. Don't make any mistakes, sir.
[11458.49s -> 11510.28s]  I think I just jumped off the camera, yeah? Computer reactions.
[11558.55s -> 11559.59s]  Sweep every time.
[11562.39s -> 11567.74s]  I gotta back up a little. Not a great trade there.
[11568.46s -> 11577.38s]  Oh, I got a bad start here. I gotta get back into this shit.
[11579.94s -> 11587.38s]  No, I thought it was the spin. It's just so easy to get caught up and get hit by one of those.
[11587.38s -> 11588.66s]  They both have the same wind up.
[11620.71s -> 11624.47s]  Eight fucking goids. Oh yeah, crouch. Please crouch. Yeah, can I disable that fucking button?
[11625.27s -> 11633.72s]  How do I- I'm gonna disable crouch. Seriously. I'm gonna disable it. It's so easy to press it.
[11636.79s -> 11639.75s]  Like, why the fuck is this even a thing in the game? Like, get rid of it. I don't want it.
[11639.75s -> 11643.74s]  No crouch. Get- get the fuck out of here. I can't even unbind it.
[11654.71s -> 11675.11s]  No, that doesn't matter. I can't unbind it. Really? I didn't fucking anything else up, right?
[11677.24s -> 11681.16s]  Yeah. Like, get that fucking off my bar. So unnecessary.
[11687.85s -> 11691.13s]  Every time it's at the little palm block, it's a thrust.
[11692.79s -> 11703.35s]  Crouch. I've used crouch like three times in the 45 hours I played this game.
[11719.67s -> 11737.90s]  No, I fucking ran into it. Man. I fucking thought it- ugh.
[11747.90s -> 11758.12s]  Because of that whole third- I don't even know what he does. That's the worst part about this
[11758.12s -> 11764.60s]  fan is just grinding to fucking get to the third bubble. To see the new move. That's going to
[11764.68s -> 11771.02s]  instantly kill me. Fucking government project. It really is. I swear to God.
[11773.38s -> 11807.13s]  Like, see how susceptible they are. Fucking repetition. I tried to jump,
[11807.13s -> 11809.13s]  but the fucking fat ass finger just hit the button.
[11824.98s -> 11828.90s]  That was quick right off the bat. Whatever. I got nine of these fucking things.
[11834.34s -> 11844.25s]  Mistake. That was a mistake. I gotta run.
[11844.25s -> 11881.82s]  What? How did I not parry that? I wish that jump follow-up would work, like, even half the time.
[11904.41s -> 11906.17s]  Dodge instead of what I wanted to do.
[11914.34s -> 11919.14s]  Sometimes I forget I'm playing from. Every button is the same button software.
[11921.35s -> 11927.59s]  From soft from every fucking- there's three actions on one button. Am I playing red dead?
[11955.53s -> 11958.70s]  That was fucking dog shit. Dog shit is what we call it.
[11962.84s -> 11969.10s]  We'll just do this until you stop.
[11969.10s -> 11999.16s]  What? Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me. Every single ledge in the game. Every single one.
[11999.16s -> 12004.04s]  Go back and watch every vaude. Every single ledge you can't run off of. It stops you. You have to
[12004.04s -> 12014.47s]  jump. I just walked off that one. No fucking way. I even tested it. I was running into the fucking
[12014.47s -> 12024.98s]  wall like an hour ago. I don't have any gourds left. Oh, that's so fucking stupid. Why can you
[12024.98s -> 12032.02s]  even walk off the edge here? Of all things to add to this encounter, being able to fall off the
[12032.02s -> 12063.86s]  fucking edge. Right now I'm in like phase three or some shit. I'm screaming right now. I mean,
[12063.86s -> 12068.50s]  I could use my pellets, but this is- I'm dead here. I'm gonna- he's gonna come and just smash me.
[12085.77s -> 12093.06s]  Really? I can't believe that. Now we're at the edge again. Make sure you don't walk off the edge.
[12110.94s -> 12116.14s]  My posture's recovering so slowly right now. Fucking god damn it, man.
[12116.14s -> 12144.90s]  You know, they're gonna make a game somehow harder than this one, and then nobody will play it.
[12145.78s -> 12155.80s]  They're gonna keep going until there's no way you can beat it. The next game from From Software
[12155.80s -> 12170.68s]  makes, uh, it might be, it might be like times five. Because blood- all right, remember Bloodborne?
[12170.68s -> 12176.68s]  Everyone's like, holy shit, Bloodborne is crazy. And then everyone- but here's the next part, right?
[12176.68s -> 12180.84s]  Once everybody figures out how to play this game, and more than two weeks go by,
[12181.24s -> 12186.20s]  we'll figure out every little cheese, everything to do. It's- you have to learn how to parry, right?
[12187.32s -> 12194.60s]  But man, going from iFrames to this, holy shit, it's like completely different. You have to
[12194.60s -> 12199.64s]  relearn an entire new video game. Like, not even just a new video game, but like, an entirely new
[12199.64s -> 12207.06s]  thinking. A lot of games don't even come close with the kind of mechanics that are here,
[12207.06s -> 12213.62s]  in regards to how it feels. It's fucking amazing! This is fucking awesome! But my goodness,
[12213.62s -> 12218.74s]  does it take a lot to fucking forget everything you've ever learned? Playing most of your games.
[12232.34s -> 12237.62s]  I- seriously, I got- my reaction times just went to shit right there. I was waiting for it.
[12247.08s -> 12253.05s]  You're not supposed to beat this dude in one night. You're supposed to come back like six
[12253.05s -> 12257.77s]  times and beat this guy. You're supposed to play it blank and process the fucking encounter.
[12263.45s -> 12350.10s]  Let's go. That's all I did? It's back to healed. Whoa, whoa, hold on here. What was that? I got
[12350.10s -> 12351.94s]  like- that was strange. It like turned me around.
[12408.10s -> 12412.02s]  That back pull, fuck that. Oh, come yoooon.
[12458.97s -> 12460.09s]  More of this fucking combo?
[12485.30s -> 12489.14s]  All right, what the fuck have we got now? I've got to see it. I gotta revive.
[12506.33s -> 12540.98s]  Didn't get it? It didn't get it. I didn't get it. Risky, but it worth it. No, I thought he was doing
[12540.98s -> 12556.57s]  the thing. No, what? He did it twice in a fucking row. How am I not getting this? Fuck you. This
[12556.57s -> 12588.54s]  is not- this is- I got- no, I thought it was the lightning move again. No, it was- I thought it
[12588.54s -> 12604.33s]  was the lightning move. Fuck, man. No. I thought he was doing for the lightning and I'm just gonna
[12604.33s -> 12613.10s]  try and time it. You have to jump so much later than he does. Oh, painful. Painful, painful,
[12613.10s -> 12625.64s]  painful, painful. I got- come on. That was the best attempt all night. Oh, trying, guys. I really am.
[12626.54s -> 12662.31s]  I'm trying. I promise. I'm trying. Okay, come on, man. I gotta use the buffs? Yeah, but the thing is,
[12664.39s -> 12672.36s]  duh. They take like a couple seconds to work and knowing me, I'm gonna use them and get hit
[12672.36s -> 12690.55s]  by something and die. I know me. Well, that was dumb. I'm still like fucking shook up from that
[12690.55s -> 12702.89s]  last one. See if I can get a decent attempt here. No, I'm getting too close, I think.
[12705.37s -> 12790.26s]  I just teleported into one. Let's just use one now. Back up, back up. Not worth it. It's bad.
[12791.38s -> 12807.35s]  No, man. I have no way. I- I couldn't get up. Fuck me. That combo, you gotta just run away.
[12807.35s -> 12826.89s]  You can't be stopped. This one right here, man. It's just no fucking way.
[12826.89s -> 12838.54s]  It's really neat. When he does that, like, he does like four or five moves in a row,
[12838.54s -> 12855.58s]  and even if you parry him, you're just dead. You have to just run. Next time. Just gotta relax.
[12867.75s -> 12878.68s]  Whoops. I fat-fingered that. Yeah, I fucked it up. My hands are like covered in fucking water
[12878.68s -> 12889.38s]  right now. I gotta like fucking wipe them off with something. This controller is fucking filthy.
[12893.05s -> 12904.66s]  I'm gonna get him. I'll beat him. Positive thoughts only here. Only positive vibes today.
[12904.66s -> 12906.74s]  That's not true. I've been fucking talking shit this whole time.
[12910.34s -> 12935.24s]  I thought that, uh, getting sloppy. Not really actually getting sloppy. Like, for real getting
[12935.24s -> 12953.99s]  sloppy. I'm still a lightning run from that fucking lightning run. Yeah, look at me. My,
[12953.99s -> 12975.90s]  like, body is, like, nerves up. Just making mistakes. Let's go. Bad. I have six heals left.
[12984.95s -> 13013.21s]  I'm fucked here. Nope, okay. Oh, fuck. No. I just jumped preemptively like an idiot.
[13014.01s -> 13031.13s]  No, no, no, no. This first phase fucks me every time. Seriously. Now he's back to fucking zero posture again.
[13037.26s -> 13057.14s]  It's slowing down. I gotta fucking. Couple more tries, and then I'm gonna grab some water.
[13062.17s -> 13071.26s]  Damn. I'm gonna grab some water. I'm gonna slam like 16 outs, and I'm gonna come up fair.
[13071.26s -> 13073.50s]  Did you ever lied about Minecraft fair? Thanks for the five community subs.
[13074.14s -> 13077.18s]  Thank you so much. Every stream has seen me give subs, dude. Thank you.
[13078.38s -> 13096.65s]  That's not it. Oh, I keep, you know, I never see him do that, so that's why I keep getting
[13097.37s -> 13131.77s]  me. I usually. It's all right, just get the fuck out. Sloppy.
[13141.18s -> 13146.06s]  That combo gets me every single time, and he starts off with it every time, man.
[13146.06s -> 13149.58s]  That, like, one, one, two, three. And snap, I never parry it.
[13174.74s -> 13179.14s]  I didn't dodge that. How is that fucking possible? I looked like I did.
[13186.81s -> 13204.17s]  God, that was not what I thought it was. I almost got fucking hit by that, too.
[13212.68s -> 13215.42s]  That, look at how far away I was.
[13230.04s -> 13236.23s]  See, there it is, man. There it is. No, no way can you stop that. It's not. No way. No way.
[13236.23s -> 13308.26s]  Even if you want to parry everything. No fucking way. Clean, too. Real clean.
[13319.29s -> 13336.06s]  Back it up. Don't stay in here. Don't stay in. No reason to. This is bullshit.
[13336.62s -> 13359.86s]  Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin. Let's do it. I'm ready. What do you mean? What's wrong with the
[13359.86s -> 13387.58s]  audio? There's a buzzing sound? What? Are we good? All right. Here we go. Here we go. Stupid
[13387.58s -> 13394.94s]  fucking mouse. Oh my God. Get the mouse off the screen. Why can I not? Oh my fucking God.
[13394.94s -> 13459.34s]  Why is this even a thing? I thought I was. No, no. God damn it, Jeremy. Fuck you.
[13460.38s -> 13575.38s]  I got no opportunity. I have to just fucking go. Yes. He's dead. Yes. Fuck you. Wait, no.
[13576.18s -> 13590.81s]  Face four. He's face four. I can't move. No, face. I don't care. Just give me the credits.
[13607.11s -> 13626.65s]  Oh, that was fucking crazy. Damn, what a fucking game. Initial P thanks to the five community subs.
[13628.28s -> 13634.18s]  Oh, I could like cry right now. God damn it, man. That was fucking crazy.
[13639.38s -> 13651.88s]  One fucking mistake. Your body just gets so, so beside itself. Okay, here we go. Let's read this.
[13651.88s -> 13654.52s]  The battle memory of an extraordinary foe lingering in the mind of the wolf.
[13655.08s -> 13659.40s]  Commune with a sculptor's idol and confront memories of battle for attack power. At his peak,
[13660.04s -> 13664.92s]  Ishina Ashina devoted himself to deadly conflict in pursuit of strength, a single-minded killing
[13664.92s -> 13684.79s]  machine of a man. Dragon Flash. Oh, all right. So I'll tell you, Mike, you want to talk about
[13684.79s -> 13689.83s]  like a final rating for the game? We're at like an eight seven last night, right? Yesterday.
[13693.69s -> 13704.36s]  That fight was so ridiculous. I had, I think that bumped it up to a nine. I hated that,
[13704.36s -> 13714.89s]  but I loved it at the same time. Oh, it's so exhilarating. I think that I think I get,
[13714.89s -> 13722.50s]  I think I'm going to give this a nine. In his younger years, Ishina was a devil with the
[13722.50s -> 13727.38s]  sword, spending his days in pursuit of life or death combat. He often ruminated on how a cut
[13727.38s -> 13732.18s]  should be made, but his blade always moved first. He ain't going to get up, right? Is that,
[13732.18s -> 13740.70s]  he's not going to like stand up and turn into an ape. Look, bucko, we don't want to hear your life
[13740.70s -> 13748.82s]  story. I did it. I did it. Yes. I was, I had some thoughts there that maybe not. You know,
[13748.82s -> 13754.42s]  I was getting a lot of self-doubt halfway through that fight. And I'm just sitting there going,
[13754.42s -> 13763.54s]  oh, am I going to be, am I going to be one of the people like the, is there anything else I can do?
[13769.37s -> 13774.33s]  Oh man. It feels so good to just know that it's over. Well, not, oh, well, not that I,
[13774.33s -> 13794.68s]  I'm glad the game is over, but that fight is over. You okay, Kuro? Give divine dragons tear.
[13795.32s -> 13814.74s]  I mean, I have it here. Your side. Oh, it's ridiculous. I can't even get over it.
[13818.44s -> 13823.08s]  Take the dragon tears. I can't wait to play Picross for like another hour or two. We're coming down
[13823.08s -> 13828.44s]  hard here, guys. I'm going to come down and play Picross and just hang out.
[13855.77s -> 13878.39s]  Now sever these ties of immortality. Well, that kid's a bad-ass, not even like a,
[13879.59s -> 13917.66s]  wait, wait, wait, what? I become the sculptor now? I think it is best that you have this.
[13918.30s -> 13933.50s]  What is that? No doubt the day will come when a shinobi arrives seeking strength.
[13934.78s -> 13954.86s]  Oh, the cycle just repeats. So wait, what? So I, was I the sculptor? You are the sculptor. So you,
[13954.86s -> 13969.58s]  the shinobi then shows up and you do the whole thing again. Well, I got the two snake hearts,
[13969.58s -> 13979.35s]  but I didn't use them apparently. It's the same story as Dark Souls.
[13983.35s -> 13994.25s]  Oh, that was exhilarating. It was, I had a, I said a lot. I talked a lot of shit,
[13994.25s -> 14003.32s]  but it was venting. I hope you guys understand that because that was truly like a fucking ridiculous
[14003.32s -> 14014.76s]  experience. Here's the, you know what? I'm going to tell you something right now.
[14016.82s -> 14020.42s]  They're going to have to do something. Is anything going to be able to,
[14020.42s -> 14027.90s]  I feel like every other video game is, let me turn this down. After playing through Sekiro,
[14027.90s -> 14043.24s]  I feel like every other video game is just not even going to be easy. No more video games can
[14043.24s -> 14055.35s]  be made. Video games are easy now. I'm going to be so spoiled rotten. I'm going to go play another
[14055.35s -> 14061.03s]  game and it's going to be like, this is not as hard as Sekiro. This is easy. I'm just, I'm ruined
[14061.03s -> 14079.26s]  forever. No, but for all my venting complaints, frustrations, that was, that was fantastic.
[14082.33s -> 14092.81s]  I am very, very happy to have that experience. I think some of these bosses, a couple of them
[14092.81s -> 14098.50s]  were probably my favorites of the whole series, just in the way that they're, you play them.
[14103.94s -> 14111.19s]  Ludwig from Bloodborne is my favorite boss ever made, but I would probably say
[14111.91s -> 14123.69s]  that the ape, the first time you fight the ape was just crazy. That was so cool. It was really
[14123.69s -> 14129.77s]  kind of out there and frustrating, but it was, the guardian ape was a very interesting, cool encounter.
[14130.33s -> 14145.54s]  Sekiro isn't a Soulsborne though, I know. The owl fight was awesome. Even some of the, just the
[14145.54s -> 14153.75s]  mini bosses were really, really interesting too. Kill Demon of Hatred, I did. I did that before this.
[14158.52s -> 14163.48s]  How would you rank it compared to Dark Souls 1 through 3? Well, it's kind of not fair to make
[14163.48s -> 14170.39s]  that comparison though, because they're just not the same. It's, Bloodborne I think is my favorite
[14170.39s -> 14178.28s]  still, but that's, I'm so biased for Bloodborne. It's like one of my favorite games ever made
[14178.28s -> 14190.47s]  of all time. It might even be my favorite game ever made, but Sekiro is probably, I think it's,
[14193.64s -> 14201.45s]  I think it's better than Dark Souls 3, just in regards to, but it's also new and Dark Souls 3
[14201.45s -> 14208.54s]  really did kind of feel like they really wanted to end that series. So I loved Dark Souls 3,
[14208.54s -> 14216.42s]  but I think this is probably a better game than Dark Souls 3 in regards to just overall package.
[14219.88s -> 14223.48s]  I think it's better than Dark Souls 3, but I think it's not as good as Bloodborne.
[14223.48s -> 14228.38s]  I'm very biased on that. Bloodborne is a full straight up 10 out of 10 for me.
[14233.85s -> 14236.81s]  With or without the DLC for Dark Souls 3? The DLC in Dark Souls 3 was cool.
[14237.37s -> 14252.22s]  The ice area was really cool. Was the game harder as a whole? I think so, because this game forces
[14252.22s -> 14258.38s]  you to play the game the way that they want you to play it. In all the Dark Souls and Soulsborne
[14258.38s -> 14264.04s]  games, you can approach any situation however you want. You can put on a full set of armor,
[14264.04s -> 14267.88s]  you can get a hide behind a shield, you can use eye frames, you can do eye frame abuse,
[14269.19s -> 14273.35s]  you can build a certain character based on one-shotting bosses. You can't do that here.
[14274.15s -> 14278.47s]  You can go grind souls and go over level for a boss. Can't do that here either.
[14279.03s -> 14284.92s]  So I think this is much harder than any of the Souls games, just because you could build an
[14284.92s -> 14293.91s]  entire character and grind to beat any boss in like three hits. So in that regard, I think this is
[14293.91s -> 14298.47s]  five to ten times harder than any of the Souls games. Not because the game is harder, but because
[14298.47s -> 14303.91s]  you can't play it the way that you want. You have to play this game. You have to do it the way that
[14303.91s -> 14319.05s]  they want you to. And if you don't, you're dead. Good, see you later. I don't like the overleveling
[14319.05s -> 14323.62s]  shit. I think this game makes for better bosses and balance. That's true, but you also, you have
[14323.62s -> 14328.82s]  to understand though, is a lot of people kind of just want to play it. And if something's really
[14328.82s -> 14335.02s]  too fucking hard, like sometimes you'll hit a wall and it's just like, I can't, and no summoning,
[14335.02s -> 14342.94s]  no co-op. How many people do you know that played through the Dark Souls games that had to do bosses
[14342.94s -> 14360.31s]  with partners? You can't, do you have to, you have to play a bunch of casuals. Yeah, but like I said,
[14360.87s -> 14365.00s]  when I was in the middle of this last fight, what's the percentage of people that are going to
[14365.00s -> 14370.71s]  beat that? What, has somebody said that the demon of hatred was what, six percent of players that
[14370.71s -> 14378.63s]  have the game on Steam that have that achievement? That's not very much. That is so small of a
[14378.63s -> 14383.51s]  percentage of people that have the game. And it did just come up, that's true, but I don't think
[14383.51s -> 14392.25s]  that number will get any more than, I don't think that number will go higher than like 20 or 30 percent.
[14392.25s -> 14399.11s]  It's about two percent for Isshin right now. Wow. So, I mean, so yeah, I know, I know the philosophy
[14399.11s -> 14405.50s]  is get good, get good, but maybe some people don't really want to. You know, what if you only have
[14405.50s -> 14410.07s]  like a couple hours to like really sit down and play a game? You know, oh, I just got off of work
[14410.07s -> 14419.51s]  and I got to grind and get good. It can be hard. So that's why stuff like the co-op, having a friend
[14419.51s -> 14425.75s]  come in and play with like a party, being able to overlevel yourself just to kind of play it.
[14425.75s -> 14430.78s]  Now you could say, well, that's not the way the game is supposed to be played, but judging by
[14430.78s -> 14442.07s]  the percentages that you see, some people have to do it like that. But in all those regards, all
[14442.07s -> 14447.05s]  those things that we talked about, that's why this game I think is much harder. It has nothing
[14447.05s -> 14450.65s]  really to do with like the game's physical mechanics as much as you have to play the way
[14450.65s -> 14457.37s]  the game tells you to. No friends, no fucking item abuse, no iFrame abuse. You've got to fucking do
[14457.37s -> 14464.36s]  it. And it can be very frustrating, very, listen to me talking, very frustrating. All right. If you
[14464.36s -> 14469.82s]  choose to start playthrough two now, you may do so by accessing the large sculptor's idol in the...
[14469.82s -> 14481.38s]  Um, is there anything left I could do? Or that's a new game plus. Well, I'm not going to start it
[14482.87s -> 14494.76s]  now. Oh, there are other headlesses. Oh, he's still alive. You're still alive. Well, let me
[14494.76s -> 14510.07s]  bring everybody back to life one more time. Oh, there we go. Start playthrough two. Isshina Isshina
[14510.07s -> 14519.00s]  at 2% is the bad ending. Not Sword Saint Isshina, who is at 8%. Okay, that's still very little.
[14519.64s -> 14539.98s]  There's an optional boss in the estate. Let me see. 221 total deaths. 52 deaths at Isshin. Damn.
[14542.14s -> 14553.34s]  52. That's so many. I can't believe I kept my fucking composure and kept going. So 220.
[14556.34s -> 14563.72s]  God, how did you guys put up with me for that long? Seriously. I hope I wasn't too fucking
[14563.72s -> 14571.10s]  obnoxious during that. Seriously. I can imagine I would be, I was probably so fucking annoying.
[14571.74s -> 14589.14s]  I hate doing that, but it's just frustration coming out. I don't mean fucking any of it.
[14589.94s -> 14606.06s]  I muted you for a while. I'm sorry. It was fucking fun though. Isshina, if you gotta do
[14606.06s -> 14611.02s]  what you gotta do. Thanks for still sticking around and watching though. Appreciate that.
[14611.02s -> 14620.26s]  I had to get good and I tried and I did. So 220 deaths. I was gonna do a scratch ticket
[14620.34s -> 14628.58s]  for every death. I'm not buying 220 $1 scratch tickets. That'll take two weeks to scratch them.
[14630.68s -> 14635.08s]  So we're gonna do like fives or something. Yeah, we'll do five. Wait, hold on. How many is that?
[14636.17s -> 14643.53s]  That's still a ton. What about $10 tickets? The higher the denomination goes, guys,
[14643.53s -> 14650.89s]  the more chance to win. You don't win shit with a $1 scratch ticket. No, I'm not gonna scratch
[14651.13s -> 14658.82s]  220 tickets. Do you understand how stupid that is? That'll take two or three straight streams.
[14658.82s -> 14672.78s]  That's gonna be like 15 hours. 22 $10 tickets and one $1 ticket or $44, $5. Depends. Now I still
[14672.78s -> 14676.46s]  have to make sure that that's like a legal thing to do for Terms of Service because then whatever
[14676.46s -> 14686.73s]  happens from there goes into community subs. It's gonna be called secure scratch off for community
[14686.81s -> 14697.78s]  subs. It's gonna have to be a whole stream. It really is. That's gonna be the weirdest stream
[14704.14s -> 14708.30s]  or charity. Yeah, that's probably a better idea. Whatever I get
[14708.30s -> 14720.89s]  from the scratch offs is going right to charity. That's better. All right, I think that's it for
[14720.89s -> 14729.98s]  this gambling for charity for securo death. People are gonna stumble into that stream and just be
[14729.98s -> 14737.14s]  like, what the fuck is this guy doing? Oh, right, right, there's a boss apparently that I missed.
[14737.14s -> 14750.74s]  Let's just go look at it. Dude, imagine if I won like 50 grand. That would be an awesome charitable
[14750.74s -> 14758.94s]  donation there. Imagine winning like 100 grand on one of those tickets. Did you do the ape fights?
[14758.94s -> 14772.87s]  Yeah, I did both of them. But there was one here, right? Let me just take a look. It won't be as
[14772.87s -> 14781.22s]  weird as the labo streams. What? Why are the labo streams weird? Just because I got shit faced and
[14781.22s -> 14787.45s]  started like karate kicking the camera. All right, let me I'm gonna just run around. I know
[14787.45s -> 14800.41s]  there was something. Is that weird? Or is that just like a Saturday, you know? Oh, no, it's with the
[14801.05s -> 14813.91s]  the flute guys, right? Do the lake headless. I did the lake headless already, didn't I?
[14814.55s -> 14831.99s]  The one that was in the water there. The dog just killed me. I don't think I'm in the right spot.
[14837.54s -> 14845.74s]  I think it's a different one. Flower viewing, great sakura.
[14847.45s -> 14855.03s]  No, it is this one. Oh, 222 scratch sticks. No, we don't let's don't count anymore. 221.
[14869.29s -> 14875.13s]  My like my like relaxation is starting to like kick in. I'm like, oh, oh, it's I did it.
[14875.77s -> 14892.15s]  What a fucking tough game. Uh, where are we going? Did I fight Owl? Yeah, I think I did all the
[14892.15s -> 14904.26s]  optional like major bosses. Now, I feel like because I ran through this. Scrooge.
[14905.06s -> 14919.42s]  Scrooge, what the fuck is happening? Oh, oh, yeah, I rage unbounded. Why can I not? No,
[14919.42s -> 14930.42s]  that's the wrong one. Oh, what a psycho. God, I hate being like rage streamer. Like, I don't like it,
[14930.98s -> 14935.66s]  but it's all right. Sometimes you have to have some of those moments. Where uh, where is this guy?
[14936.22s -> 14957.53s]  I think there's only, no, just this guy, that guy. Oh, no, they're lightning. They're lightning.
[14979.66s -> 15002.01s]  Oh, I probably can just run through this to be honest. Yeah, dude. Okay, for people that just
[15002.01s -> 15008.23s]  came here, I can't do it. I've been stuck here for two straight days. The stealth section is so
[15008.23s -> 15015.75s]  irritating. I can't fucking do it. I don't know what to do. I don't know where to go. It's just so
[15015.75s -> 15034.07s]  fucked up, man. Right. Okay, so I didn't wait a minute. Did I go down here? Yeah, I don't think
[15034.07s -> 15055.06s]  I'm going to be able to complete this. Oh, it's a gourd seed. Relax. That was weird. I really got
[15055.06s -> 15087.34s]  clipped inside of him. First impression, I don't like the stealth part. Doesn't like stealth in a
[15087.34s -> 15099.19s]  samurai game. I don't like this part. I don't like it. Stop banning people. Somebody actually, I
[15099.19s -> 15105.03s]  didn't mention it because I was just kind of, I was kind of tilted during the last fight, last boss,
[15105.91s -> 15113.83s]  but somebody said, I'm going to paraphrase it here, but they said, damn, he's getting so salty.
[15113.83s -> 15127.69s]  I wonder if he's going to actually start banning people. You know, like look over and see somebody
[15127.69s -> 15132.81s]  be like, oh, dude, you suck. It's already salty. When is he going to start to actually ban somebody?
[15132.81s -> 15139.29s]  Never done that before. We make jokes on this channel all the time about, oh yeah, like get
[15139.29s -> 15144.49s]  banned. It's a permanent ban. And it's like 10 seconds, right? It's a joke. I've never done that
[15144.49s -> 15164.06s]  before. Imagine just getting so upset and just so just tilted and raged that like somebody says
[15164.06s -> 15169.66s]  something that I just like fucking shut up and like ban somebody. No, I don't know if it would
[15169.66s -> 15177.82s]  ever get there. That's the thing. I don't, whenever I get upset at a game, I don't take it out on other
[15177.82s -> 15184.81s]  people. I take it out on like myself mostly. Like I'll say like, what the fuck? What an idiot. Like
[15184.81s -> 15193.74s]  I was a bad move, but I don't think I would ever like be so angry that I would like tell like a
[15193.74s -> 15198.70s]  viewer like, dude, you're wrong. Shut the fuck up. Like I don't, I don't know. I don't know why I
[15198.70s -> 15223.88s]  would do that. Have I ever been banned? It's like from you mean from a chat? Uh, um, I know. I don't
[15223.88s -> 15238.14s]  think so. All right. This is the place that I didn't go to this. Oh my God. He's looking over
[15238.14s -> 15247.14s]  here. No, we're fine. Um, this is good. Will this work? Cause I feel like I'm going to do this and
[15247.14s -> 15256.50s]  then I got to put the shuriken on. Cause all right. If you get to that point, right? Let's say you get
[15256.50s -> 15261.06s]  to a point where you're really actually starting to get mad at viewers and like telling people
[15261.06s -> 15264.74s]  like to fuck off and shouldn't start banning people. The cycle is just going to go on. It's
[15264.74s -> 15269.94s]  going to be horrible because nobody likes to hear that. Like, you know, I need, nobody wants to be
[15269.94s -> 15274.90s]  told like, Hey, shut the fuck up guys. It's like, Whoa, come on man. And then all of a sudden,
[15276.42s -> 15281.54s]  like people start to get angry at you being angry at them and then they get angry at you and you
[15281.54s -> 15298.04s]  start to, it just cascades. All right. So I didn't go over here last time. That's why even if I do
[15298.04s -> 15301.48s]  like look over and see something that somebody says, something that's like mean or something,
[15302.20s -> 15308.10s]  for the most part, I know that people are just fucking around and I wouldn't want to like
[15308.10s -> 15311.78s]  escalate something just because somebody was like, dude, you like kind of suck at this. It's like,
[15311.86s -> 15331.18s]  yeah. All right. All right. Whatever. Because I know a large portion of why I'm upset is
[15331.18s -> 15338.89s]  because I'm not doing well, right? So if I looked over right now and saw, holy shit, you suck.
[15339.78s -> 15347.98s]  It's like, Hey, I suck. Hey, fuck you. It's like, you know, jokey. But when you're mad,
[15347.98s -> 15353.10s]  when you're angry and you look over, there's a very high chance that that same message,
[15354.15s -> 15359.27s]  instead of making you laugh, we'll be like, I don't even know what it's like. It's hard. This
[15359.27s -> 15366.09s]  is a fucking hard game. And no, you're, you're wrong. But I obviously never want to get to that
[15366.09s -> 15371.61s]  point because I like to have fun here and not like get fucking pissed off and like hate streaming or
[15371.61s -> 15380.84s]  something. We didn't ask for your life story. Yeah, you did. All right. Where is this thing
[15380.84s -> 15388.06s]  that I'm supposed to be finding? This is the only place I didn't really explore. I like sprinted
[15388.06s -> 15410.84s]  through it after I didn't play. I'm looking for the boss. There's a boss somewhere around here.
[15410.84s -> 15425.19s]  That's what somebody told me at least. Go to the idol and take a left. I've already cleared so much.
[15437.30s -> 15465.83s]  Well, it was cool to see everything. Ooh, wait. I think I found it. It's right there. That's the
[15465.83s -> 15470.07s]  noise. Okay. That's the noise that was, remember we were over here before and everyone was
[15470.71s -> 15479.21s]  monkey. There was like a bunch of monkey from the loud noises. So I have to go around this building.
[15479.21s -> 15489.75s]  So it really is just kind of to the right here. The great Lord Walden just gave 20 community subs.
[15492.73s -> 15510.87s]  Thank you. Great Lord Walden. That's an insane amount of subs. Thank you. I think I missed
[15510.87s -> 15515.64s]  bits and shit too, during that whole process. I'm sorry if I missed like a lot of money.
[15515.64s -> 15518.92s]  Did I beat the game? I did. I'm just kind of going back and cleaning up some stuff just to see it.
[15522.50s -> 15554.02s]  So this is not the right idol. What is the idol? It's this one. No, it is. It is. Okay, I'm on the
[15554.02s -> 15579.05s]  roof. Wasn't it like right here? No, it's this way. Right? It's like straight ahead here.
[15579.85s -> 15611.45s]  No, that's not it. Jerma lied about Minecraft VR. Five more community subs. Thank you. I feel like
[15611.45s -> 15625.40s]  I've done it completely wrong. Have I lost my goddamn mind? There's none. It's right here.
[15625.40s -> 15647.98s]  So the idol's right there. The bowl is right here. Here? I'm sorry. I'm like, I know he's like
[15647.98s -> 15660.10s]  right here somewhere. Here? I found it. Right here. Oh, Jesus. Okay. I thought he was caged up.
[15660.10s -> 15671.77s]  He's just free to be here out on the bright side. I wish I found this earlier. That's a lot of money.
[15671.77s -> 15679.27s]  Okay, well, he says he has terror shit on his head. So let's, let's get that out of the way.
[15679.27s -> 15703.18s]  Let's see. Did he just shoot an arrow at me? Somebody is shooting an arrow at me. Oh, right.
[15704.06s -> 15712.34s]  The guy up on the roof. Okay. Well, maybe I gotta clear the roof then before I do this.
[15713.30s -> 15739.66s]  It's pretty clear at this point. Maybe not. Oh, here comes another lottery ticket. What am I
[15739.66s -> 15750.06s]  doing? I have no, it's not even. You don't count as a beast? Why did it not work the first time?
[15751.27s -> 15756.39s]  Really? You're not a beast? Bullshit. You're a fucking animal. You're an animal.
[15773.72s -> 15786.54s]  Probably should start parrying these things. Just dodge.
[15800.47s -> 15860.50s]  No, not a place I want to be. Ow. Come here. Come here, dog. Oh, out of gorge. He's out of gorge.
[15861.14s -> 15874.70s]  That really isn't even any terror. Oops. Okay. I'm getting really, really dumb here. Oh, I'm getting
[15874.70s -> 15918.46s]  real dumb. Round and round we go. Just stay right up his ass. Oh, he kind of popped me there.
[15933.83s -> 15939.19s]  Oh my God. I just looked over at chat. I saw somebody say Thanos. Well, what the fuck am I
[15939.19s -> 15958.31s]  doing, man? I just got like, I keep giving him such a good opportunity to hit me, to stay behind him.
[15971.11s -> 16014.84s]  Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Oh, that hurts. Hi, Gorgi. Oh, that would have been nice. That would
[16014.84s -> 16018.28s]  have been nice to have. What is it? 16? That's not really that big of a deal. Cool. All right.
[16024.25s -> 16033.11s]  Well, hold on. I can get this. Finally beat the palace. No, guys, I'm just grinding.
[16034.47s -> 16048.47s]  I can't do it. The boss in here? No, I'm just trying to grind for beads. I did. Okay,
[16048.47s -> 16056.14s]  I'm talking about areas. This area was my favorite. Not that part over there. Like, not that part.
[16056.14s -> 16059.26s]  This part. Not that actually. Not this part either. That not the stealth part.
[16059.90s -> 16065.16s]  The part where you walk down the mountain. So pretty much this is not my favorite zone. I just
[16065.16s -> 16073.82s]  like the way it looks. Worst area, in my opinion, just in regards to how hard it was for me to do.
[16074.87s -> 16087.93s]  That optional zone leading up to the demon of hatred. It just was kind of brutal going through
[16087.93s -> 16094.42s]  that. And I'm trying to think of other areas that I had just trouble with.
[16102.92s -> 16108.28s]  This area was hard to do and it was kind of frustrating with the weird lightning guys and
[16108.28s -> 16122.41s]  people kicking the ball at you. But I don't know if this is the worst area. Well, I'm here. I might
[16122.41s -> 16151.27s]  as well just try. Isn't there a headless down here? Yeah, they're right here. Ow. You actually
[16151.27s -> 16169.21s]  don't really need confetti here, huh? I'm gonna use that. Tag team headless. You know, before,
[16170.95s -> 16173.99s]  I've already seen the end of the tunnel. This doesn't even bother me anymore.
[16178.30s -> 16182.54s]  Nothing can compare to that final fight. Like, it doesn't even matter. This is just like funny
[16182.54s -> 16198.54s]  now. This is like, this is a comedy. Whatever this is, I didn't get it. Didn't even use any sugar
[16198.54s -> 16206.81s]  or anything. I was just, I remember, I'm, you see, the last boss and even the demon of hatred.
[16207.45s -> 16212.73s]  Use the items. Use the candy. Use this. Use the, you gotta do it, man. Imagine if I had, if I had
[16212.73s -> 16222.30s]  stopped and used like the candy in that third phase thinking I was, I should have, I would have
[16222.30s -> 16238.02s]  probably died. My brain is just, my brain is fucking just a mess. All right, so we got this guy.
[16238.98s -> 16248.79s]  Now there's how many, how many swings? The yellow one's throwing shit at me now.
[16251.50s -> 16261.46s]  Whoa, that goes across the whole place, huh? Um, I wonder if I should kill the
[16262.10s -> 16274.98s]  illusion first. Let's see. How hard, how annoying are you? Yeah, you got way less health.
[16275.86s -> 16302.58s]  You're just annoying. Okay, all right. I can't take this down here? I can't, oh, I can't use that.
[16305.11s -> 16339.83s]  All right, well, no, get out. He's almost dead. There it is. One down. Okay, now I wonder. I'm
[16339.83s -> 16373.16s]  already almost dead. They can't respawn, do they? Walls. Boy, I see where I'm at.
[16379.06s -> 16403.66s]  Surprise! Oh my god, what am I doing? I'm dead. Goodbye. Actually, I might be able to get it
[16403.66s -> 16433.88s]  if he does the grab again. All right, no health. Nooooo! Game sucks. Game sucks. Game sucks. Game
[16433.88s -> 16455.78s]  sucks. been a while since you heard that. mad because bad. mad because gab. gab. gabby? they're

[16620.25s -> 16629.06s]  to do a move not even looking at my health bar he's gonna do the fucking like magic missile span
[16629.06s -> 16641.69s]  three times yeah he's a stationary target don't you guys understand the people that move the
[16641.69s -> 16648.30s]  slowest i may as well just give up you the slower you are the harder you are for me to play in these
[16648.30s -> 16657.83s]  games you could telegraph and move for 15 straight like now i'm just getting angry again like these
[16657.83s -> 16666.01s]  slow slug ass fucking people takes him like three full five full seconds to a move you just sit there
[16666.01s -> 16686.68s]  with like your fucking hand up your ass waiting for him to do something he telegraphed the whole
[16686.68s -> 16697.21s]  way around oh fucking headless man this dude's not even hard it's not even hard i'm making it
[16697.21s -> 16748.07s]  so much more difficult god die die die die die die die die die die seriously like they get it's not
[16748.07s -> 16753.91s]  even a fun game like that's the problem i have it's like i it's the game is like i was a nine
[16754.87s -> 16768.02s]  and this shit is just but just part of the reason why i oh my god okay no more jokes i have to hit
[16768.02s -> 16788.33s]  him once hey you got it no actually uh kim also baked cookies and she said hey do you want some
[16788.33s -> 16797.21s]  cookies from nine to one there it is oh they get the gates aren't even fun if you get has anybody
[16797.21s -> 16814.31s]  ever said that this is a game it's not even fun any other streamers these are actually pretty good
[16818.12s -> 16826.63s]  so that's the sugar oh these are good hey thank you this is like oatmeal
[16830.22s -> 16853.91s]  hot hot all my mouth oh all right i think we did i clean up everything this is like the securito

[16902.60s -> 16914.49s]  or is this blind streamer that already went by it what do you think is it is that a case that is
[16914.49s -> 16939.66s]  the case isn't it what is happening oh it's it is it's a key item you guys got me here can't be
[16939.66s -> 16954.06s]  thinking i'm saying this is precious bait something resembling horns seem to be jutting out of it
[16954.06s -> 16962.84s]  just the kind of bait the master loves ring the bell drop the bait what the hell does that mean
[16963.32s -> 16990.68s]  i can't even select this is there a spot where i can put this i missed this in his cave
[17009.85s -> 17016.41s]  well here's the this is where he came from right so he jumped and crashed here
[17017.37s -> 17037.38s]  is there something i'm gonna do up here bait bait find a way to the roof spawn at the palace
[17037.38s -> 17043.26s]  grounds and find a way to the roof why don't i just fucking get on the roof right now like this
[17043.26s -> 17063.16s]  this an accidental button press oops a daisy oops he's not gonna get back up there is he
[17064.04s -> 17074.30s]  nope uh-oh cocks really that's not good whoa whoa whoa whoa i just got a surge of like
[17075.64s -> 17084.55s]  wow what's happening right now all right that was weird so i have my i i stream at 6 000 up
[17085.90s -> 17091.66s]  and for a few seconds right there i was just had 11 000 up i don't know how that happened
[17092.22s -> 17120.47s]  that was great gimme up there really okay top of the castle which which side should i get up here
[17121.43s -> 17137.96s]  uh you know what let's just skip this shit that i already finished yeah i did i'm just going back
[17137.96s -> 17156.23s]  and checking out some of the optional stuff that i missed all right this one this one this one
[17156.23s -> 17180.20s]  this one thinks that johnny kich this one says uh main hall which one's at the top
[17180.20s -> 17189.88s]  intersect them oh no no no no i'm in the wrong place which one of these great sacra palace
[17189.88s -> 17200.49s]  grounds i think palestine pickross isn't going to help this is i can't graduate fourth grade
[17200.49s -> 17214.78s]  level mistakes oh okay wait come on all right we're at the top there's like a canister here
[17214.78s -> 17230.34s]  put it in here fourth grade what did i walk into your sword no okay i thought for a second that was
[17231.30s -> 17240.98s]  i got hit with an arrow all right we're at the top of the palace
[17244.52s -> 17262.49s]  so if i'm a place to put bait down there i don't think i did very much exploring over here
[17262.49s -> 17281.19s]  like that way how would i can i get up there on the roof i don't think there's a grappling
[17281.19s -> 17315.43s]  point up here i'm up here can i make this jump i think i tried this before it didn't work is there
[17315.43s -> 17344.89s]  a branch let's see a branch over here but where's the there's no indicator i feel like i'm not you
[17344.89s -> 17364.74s]  know i don't see an indicator do i like the cookies the cookies are great i don't think i
[17364.74s -> 17378.09s]  could reach that god damn it whatever just quickly that takes so much longer than any other soul
[17378.97s -> 17402.73s]  software game okay let's try this again what am i eating uh i went outside and i took a shovel and
[17402.73s -> 17405.85s]  i brought some dirt in here and i figured i would chew on it for a while and like swallow it and
[17405.85s -> 17438.58s]  shit is your eye is your uh no i'm confused grapple from the bonfire area like back here
[17439.14s -> 17463.88s]  definitely from back here on the roof of this building we didn't ask you for your life story
[17464.52s -> 17468.28s]  yes but is there a point i can get to from here i don't see anything from here
[17470.01s -> 17490.81s]  have to go around here probably around this way right let's see a place to go ah right there
[17491.37s -> 17507.59s]  i can't get there from here do i do i have to jump oh hold on really that's kind of that'd be
[17507.59s -> 17522.52s]  really difficult to know to do that no i was gonna say just jump over like jump out you know what i
[17522.52s -> 17549.75s]  mean there it is just to go through the building journal lighter about minecraft br five more

[17622.20s -> 17627.48s]  didn't get to see the whole thing fighting optional bosses that i missed doing optional content
[17628.44s -> 17637.11s]  that kind of thing so now there's no grapple point here i guess i'm just gonna go over this
[17637.11s -> 17654.10s]  way this is all the way across leads to down here oh is it just a bridge do i just go to the bridge
[17654.66s -> 17673.85s]  i'm just gonna go to the bridge it looks like a place i haven't gone oops i mean that it looks

[18577.94s -> 18582.58s]  the pot is obsessed with thoughts of becoming a master he who receives the scale of the carp
[18582.58s -> 18606.09s]  becomes closer to a carp himself i bestow upon you my secret treasure all right okay let's go
[18607.21s -> 18637.66s]  don't forget to use the bait let's go talk to the other one what a weird questline near pot noble
[18638.38s -> 18652.33s]  he sounds like bugleberry hi no but i want to ask you a question
[18663.58s -> 18669.86s]  okay well i just have the bait i wonder do i have to do anything else with this guy or can i just
[18669.86s -> 18680.07s]  kill the fish how many scales do i need i need three more scales let's just go fish for
[18681.59s -> 18695.43s]  all right look no let's just kill this motherfucker this guy's too pushy

[18758.58s -> 18773.58s]  uh let's see okay oh no oh no i feel this is like kind of sad
[18792.02s -> 18818.15s]  i'm sad i like wish i didn't do that no he's so sad do nothing that's just mean
[18819.30s -> 18834.10s]  what is he in there what do i get for doing that is he just dead on the ground go to the travel to
[18834.10s -> 18844.81s]  a different arena the eighth boss somebody's gonna be washed up down like down here is it gonna be
[18844.81s -> 18897.43s]  so sad oh the other one uh where's the other one uh great white whisker priceless white whisker
[18897.43s -> 18903.75s]  taken from the great colored carp while the great carp is naturally immortal if killed its whiskers
[18903.75s -> 18908.39s]  can be plucked the sound of the whisker being removed is surely magic music to the ears of
[18908.39s -> 18913.59s]  certain people some would feel relief at their sound of their mission being completed others
[18913.59s -> 18925.83s]  the joy of having their heart's desire granted couldn't go in i know it would be really cool
[18926.47s -> 18932.01s]  let me tell you something how from software take a note here if you walked in here and it was
[18932.01s -> 18946.44s]  enough zone optional zone in like this magic stomach anything else that's really ridiculous
[18946.44s -> 18960.70s]  though i feel bad all right so i can i'm assuming i can give the whisker to either the guy that's
[18960.70s -> 18966.22s]  sad or one of the guys in the trashcans and i think i'm gonna give it to the guy that's sad
[18966.22s -> 18970.14s]  because that's like that's fucked up he spent his like whole life with this fish why would i
[18970.14s -> 18975.69s]  give it to that guy why would i give it to the guy that's like please i want to be a fish kill it
[18975.69s -> 18990.74s]  why do i keep calling picto pics picross because this was called it's picross is the name of the
[18990.74s -> 19023.42s]  puzzle i have something for you take it yeah i need to give this guy peace right you gotta
[19023.42s -> 19028.23s]  have some closure here even though i did it this is sick

[19145.69s -> 19164.34s]  again anything else all for some drugs you're a monster but wait wait he's still around right
[19164.34s -> 19176.52s]  there'll be another one it'll be small i thought it was gonna be a little koi fish or something
[19176.52s -> 19222.20s]  all right let's go talk to the dumpster guy uh he seems to be out of his dumpster
[19222.20s -> 19242.36s]  alapis and there he is what how did this work ha i don't understand how this works
[19243.32s -> 19255.10s]  so he was in the bucket i killed the carp and then he becomes carp no sea man what about the
[19255.10s -> 19275.22s]  other one i want to talk to the other one it's just like the giant rat didn't get any of the
[19275.22s -> 19282.33s]  mask pieces what a shame all right we'll get what are the three what does it do if you get all three
[19282.33s -> 19286.09s]  i mean that's they're very expensive five thousand dollars like 12 carps 12
[19286.65s -> 19305.06s]  that's a lot what does it actually do you can level attack power with five levels it turns skill
[19305.06s -> 19319.45s]  points into attack points oh that's kind of useful i'm so confused by what this any of this even
[19319.45s -> 19345.64s]  means this is dead why there's a boss there's a boss in there it's a new world okay so one lives
[19345.72s -> 19362.97s]  one dies cool all right well i think that's gonna do it sakira i've tied up pretty much
[19363.53s -> 19383.83s]  most of the loose ends somebody must be to go dive in the water here there's at least see the
[19383.83s -> 19390.15s]  optional boss in the estate okay well it's in the water that's this is where the headless is is it
[19394.62s -> 19410.60s]  dive in the water here i mean like over this way other way you can't get the estate boss

[19485.53s -> 19504.52s]  is the lottery thing still happening if i can do it yeah so where in the estate just out of
[19504.52s -> 19512.33s]  curiosity see if i can see it no that's that's not it's very different ending okay all right

[19554.79s -> 19567.85s]  siciro that's the end sad because i don't see another playthrough in the future for me
[19569.08s -> 19585.72s]  maybe eventually but what an experience it was view the memory what are you talking about here
[19585.72s -> 19609.02s]  like this thing oh no never mind watch the other endings i don't want to do that
[19609.02s -> 19620.30s]  because if i ever uh if for some reason i ever want to play it again i kind of want to do a
[19620.30s -> 19627.27s]  different thing one who returns from the great beyond does so at the peak of their prosperity
[19627.27s -> 19631.19s]  issuing coveted strength in all manner of techniques throughout his mortal struggle
[19631.19s -> 19641.54s]  he wished for war until his final hour and that is precisely what he got the end the only one that
