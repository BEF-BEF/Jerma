[3.45s -> 10.03s]  I got here as soon as I could. I saw the time ticking down. I was like, wait a minute, 3 to 4 p.m. I gotta go.
[12.68s -> 25.79s]  I did the sprint where both your hands, you know, you do the one hand up, flat, right hand up, flat, over and over again, just straight up, like an old lady on the sidewalk.
[25.79s -> 30.92s]  That's what I did. Alright, let me tweet it. Give me one second.
[30.92s -> 102.39s]  Alrighty, so today, my wonderful, wonderful, wonderful audience of mine, we got a bunch of PlayStation 2 stuff to do.
[103.13s -> 109.82s]  Remember I mentioned a few weeks ago that there was still a ton of stuff that I didn't do, I didn't cover?
[109.82s -> 121.85s]  Well, it's here. And I don't know the exact process we're gonna do here, because some of these are probably really good.
[121.85s -> 129.66s]  And I might have to throw away my 45 minute and then bust the way that I do things.
[129.66s -> 146.54s]  So, we'll have to figure that out. Yes, I'm realizing how not good that just sounded. That's okay.
[147.02s -> 152.64s]  I'm gonna have to change the way that I do things, maybe, because for instance, some of these are really highly requested.
[152.64s -> 160.95s]  I got Psy Ops, the Mind Gate Conspiracy, that's one of the most highly requested PlayStation 2 games from people in this community.
[160.95s -> 167.39s]  And I don't know if I want to give that one like 30 minutes.
[167.39s -> 179.71s]  Also, I got another Family Feud. This might even be the same game, just on PS2. No, I don't think it is.
[179.89s -> 193.47s]  That got a bunch. So, I'm gonna go a few days in a row here, and we'll try to go through them.
[193.47s -> 205.60s]  After this weekend here, I'm gonna go back to some newer games that have come out recently.
[205.60s -> 210.60s]  So, what we're talking about, well, you did a bunch of VR shit. Here's the PlayStation 2, here's the Dreamcast.
[210.60s -> 219.19s]  We're gonna go back to some newer releases after this weekend, but I did want to get a lot of this out of the way.
[219.37s -> 227.68s]  And Vive comes back too. I got too much stuff to do. Why can't humans just be awake for 48 hours?
[227.68s -> 240.41s]  I wish we had a 48-hour day. If humans could sleep for like 4 hours, be fully rested, you can try.
[240.41s -> 253.36s]  Alright, so, I mean, the one we're gonna start with here is one that is closest to my heart, I think.
[253.54s -> 260.17s]  The one that it just sears into my body. It's one of my favorite things I've ever seen in my life.
[260.17s -> 265.17s]  And of course, I'm talking about, hold on, I'm gonna make sure there's no naked person on the camera.
[265.17s -> 273.61s]  No, I'm talking about, well, the whole bit kind of got ruined, but what I'm talking about here is Ed Edd n Eddy,
[273.61s -> 276.61s]  The Misadventures of Ed Edd n Eddy. There it is.
[276.61s -> 295.21s]  Could have gone smoother with the reveal there. What's up with your hair? What do you mean?
[295.39s -> 311.41s]  What's wrong with it? What's wrong with my hair? Because I was in the shower.
[311.41s -> 322.60s]  I'm in Vegas! It's hot here! Why are you in a tank top? I'm in Las Vegas! It's fucking like 150 degrees here every day!
[322.60s -> 333.48s]  You look like a shitty backup actor for an MTV video. That's your opinion, okay?
[333.48s -> 337.48s]  And you're allowed to have a wrong one, but that is yours.
[337.48s -> 344.28s]  Let's get it started. Ed Edd n Eddy, The Misadventures. The Mis-Edventures.
[344.28s -> 347.28s]  I'm gonna piss a lot of people off, I think, with this one.
[347.46s -> 355.26s]  Because I'm gonna play this. Here's what's gonna happen. We'll break it down. Hold on, let me just get my controller.
[355.26s -> 363.06s]  I'm gonna play this for 15 minutes, and I'm gonna be like, okay, so walk over here, grab this box.
[363.06s -> 370.38s]  Okay, cool. That's funny. What do I do now? Nothing like really interesting is happening.
[370.38s -> 374.38s]  How do I? I'm streaming, I'm streaming. What do I say?
[374.38s -> 377.38s]  I'm gonna grab this thing. Oh, I grabbed Edd by the shoulder and I threw him.
[377.38s -> 380.38s]  Nothing's funny, nothing interesting is happening. What do I do about this?
[380.56s -> 390.37s]  That's gonna be going on internally in my head.
[390.37s -> 393.37s]  And then I'm gonna turn it off in like 30 minutes. Go, yeah, it's pretty cool.
[393.37s -> 401.09s]  I mean, I remember it was like fun. If you liked it, like, that's cool.
[401.09s -> 410.60s]  Can I even hear anything? Yeah, yeah.
[410.60s -> 424.04s]  Before we start PlayStation 2 night, can we get some yes?
[424.04s -> 427.67s]  Checking memory card. Edd n Eddy, The Misadventures.
[427.67s -> 438.99s]  He's an autosave feature. Cartoon Network. Interactive. Midway. Really?
[439.17s -> 444.55s]  I didn't know they made this. Think Video.
[444.55s -> 449.86s]  They patented like one screen 40 years ago.
[449.86s -> 463.85s]  And now they're in every single video game. A to M.
[463.85s -> 469.61s]  Oh, I'm not gonna criticize this game.
[469.61s -> 473.98s]  You don't think I'm aware of the backlash I would receive?
[473.98s -> 493.71s]  I'm not gonna move yet. Holy shit, this brings back memories.
[493.71s -> 495.71s]  Yeah, that's why I don't wanna make fun of it.
[495.71s -> 498.02s]  Not that I was going to.
[498.02s -> 500.02s]  This needs to be moved though.
[500.02s -> 502.83s]  Is the color correct? It looks weird.
[503.01s -> 509.55s]  Where's Ed? What happened to Ed?
[509.55s -> 513.71s]  How come he didn't say his name?
[513.71s -> 517.93s]  Wait, hold on a minute. Turn it up.
[517.93s -> 521.13s]  Listen. Does he say his name?
[521.13s -> 523.13s]  I heard Ed. Eddy!
[523.13s -> 529.02s]  Oh god, fuck. Whatever.
[529.02s -> 533.86s]  Why is turbo on? Why is turbo on?
[533.86s -> 540.07s]  I don't want turbo.
[540.07s -> 544.87s]  Okay, new game.
[544.87s -> 549.54s]  There's no save file. Make one.
[549.54s -> 553.54s]  If somebody wants to make, like, a video, I'm just gonna give you an idea for a video.
[553.54s -> 555.54s]  Whoever wants to make it, go for it.
[555.72s -> 557.72s]  This is not my idea.
[557.72s -> 559.72s]  This is an idea of somebody that would think this is a good idea.
[559.72s -> 562.60s]  It's not my idea.
[562.60s -> 564.60s]  Wait, what? Eddy's game? Ed's game?
[564.60s -> 566.84s]  Doesn't matter?
[566.84s -> 568.84s]  Let's do Eddy.
[568.84s -> 570.84s]  Alright, so remember, this is not my idea.
[570.84s -> 572.84s]  If you want, you know Venom?
[572.84s -> 575.02s]  How he calls him Eddy?
[575.02s -> 577.64s]  Throughout the course of the movie?
[577.64s -> 579.82s]  You could put, like, Venom in here as, like,
[579.82s -> 582.44s]  Ed! Ed! Eddy!
[582.44s -> 584.44s]  That video would get, like, at least 12,000 views.
[584.62s -> 594.36s]  So, Sockhead, where are we gonna get enough ice to make snow cones?
[594.36s -> 598.36s]  I'm sure we could locate sufficient frost shavings in the backyard coolers of the neighborhood, kids, Eddy.
[600.36s -> 602.36s]  I love how much everybody hates this.
[602.36s -> 605.76s]  Alright, I gotta slow it down, because I got, like,
[605.76s -> 607.76s]  two or three everybody hates this
[607.76s -> 609.76s]  things in the first, like, five minutes of this stream.
[609.76s -> 614.30s]  Haven't I learned, I gotta stop, like,
[614.30s -> 616.30s]  intentionally hate this?
[616.30s -> 618.30s]  Collect ice cubes to make snow cones.
[618.30s -> 622.14s]  Select Ed by pressing R1.
[622.14s -> 624.14s]  Okay.
[624.32s -> 627.26s]  Select Ed, so you can cycle through.
[627.26s -> 629.26s]  When an object glows, it means that you can interact with it
[629.26s -> 631.44s]  by pressing the triangle button.
[631.44s -> 635.92s]  Alright, so there's, uh,
[635.92s -> 637.92s]  Okay, I got the,
[637.92s -> 639.92s]  I got the potato slicer.
[639.92s -> 641.92s]  Let's get ice cubes.
[641.92s -> 644.42s]  Throw shit? Okay.
[644.42s -> 646.91s]  Good work, Ed's special ability is to lift and throw objects.
[646.91s -> 648.91s]  And what do we got for, what is his move?
[648.91s -> 650.91s]  Press the square button to do basic attack.
[650.91s -> 656.10s]  He has a power-up,
[656.10s -> 658.10s]  He has a power-up,
[658.10s -> 660.10s]  He has a power-up,
[660.28s -> 662.28s]  He has a punch, okay.
[668.10s -> 670.53s]  So the ice cubes are supposed to be,
[670.53s -> 672.84s]  from my understanding here,
[672.84s -> 674.84s]  they're like puzzle pieces from Banjo,
[674.84s -> 676.84s]  or stars from Mario.
[676.84s -> 678.84s]  Alright, so that's the,
[678.84s -> 680.84s]  so, don't be mad at me, I don't know who is who.
[680.84s -> 683.27s]  I'm just gonna say,
[683.27s -> 685.27s]  I'm gonna say Ed 1,
[685.27s -> 687.27s]  2, and 3.
[687.27s -> 689.27s]  Oh, he has an attack too.
[689.27s -> 694.05s]  And let's go.
[694.05s -> 696.05s]  Now, he has a slingshot.
[696.23s -> 699.18s]  Does Ed have a grenade?
[699.18s -> 702.18s]  Launch a stink bomb,
[702.18s -> 704.18s]  most enemies are stunned by stink bombs, okay.
[707.13s -> 709.30s]  They all have their own version of the Naruto run.
[711.30s -> 714.18s]  He looks like he's trying to do the Naruto run,
[714.18s -> 719.88s]  but he doesn't have any bones.
[719.88s -> 721.88s]  Stink bomb.
[724.88s -> 726.88s]  Okay, so we can push,
[726.88s -> 728.88s]  launch a stink bomb,
[728.88s -> 730.88s]  so, how do we launch him?
[730.88s -> 732.88s]  Press L1 with Ed,
[733.06s -> 735.06s]  to perform the battered Ed formation.
[735.06s -> 737.06s]  This move can be used to smash through objects.
[739.81s -> 745.64s]  Pretty awesome.
[745.64s -> 750.95s]  Pretty cool game, pretty fun.
[750.95s -> 752.95s]  If you liked this game back in the day,
[752.95s -> 754.95s]  that's cool, because it's good.
[754.95s -> 759.41s]  It's pretty good.
[759.41s -> 763.76s]  How do I get this off? What's on me?
[763.76s -> 765.76s]  What is attached to me?
[765.76s -> 767.76s]  I have an animal on me.
[767.76s -> 769.76s]  Find a cat to lift and throw at the dog,
[769.76s -> 771.76s]  to get him away from the cooler.
[771.76s -> 774.32s]  How do I get this off me?
[774.50s -> 779.11s]  Ed's gonna die.
[779.11s -> 785.90s]  No, get off of me!
[785.90s -> 791.64s]  Alright, he died.
[791.64s -> 797.59s]  Watch out for the squirrel.
[797.59s -> 799.59s]  Why are there so many squirrels?
[799.59s -> 801.90s]  I gotta hit them.
[801.90s -> 803.90s]  Press L1 with Ed, digging the sand.
[803.90s -> 805.90s]  Chickens are present in each level.
[805.90s -> 807.90s]  Catch the chicken by stunning it.
[807.90s -> 809.90s]  And then grab it with Ed.
[809.90s -> 812.07s]  Watch out, watch out!
[812.07s -> 815.98s]  God damn it, which one of these is Ed?
[815.98s -> 817.98s]  Ed's the big one, right?
[817.98s -> 832.62s]  Ed is...
[832.80s -> 834.80s]  Let me try.
[834.80s -> 836.80s]  Chickens are present in each level.
[836.80s -> 838.80s]  Catch the chicken by stunning it, and then grab it.
[838.80s -> 840.80s]  Why do I have a fucking trash can?
[840.80s -> 843.04s]  Where did I get a trash can?
[843.04s -> 851.61s]  This one's Eddie, right?
[851.61s -> 853.61s]  The one with the sock in his head?
[853.61s -> 861.08s]  No, that's Ed.
[861.08s -> 866.46s]  Who's the one with the antenna?
[866.46s -> 869.08s]  This is Ed,
[869.08s -> 871.58s]  with 1D.
[871.58s -> 873.58s]  This is Eddie, right?
[873.58s -> 877.04s]  Also, Ed.
[877.04s -> 885.10s]  Ed's the big one.
[885.28s -> 887.28s]  Ed's the big one.
[887.28s -> 889.46s]  Eddie is the one...
[889.46s -> 891.70s]  Okay, Eddie's the one with the antenna.
[891.70s -> 900.21s]  Eddie's the one with the yellow shirt.
[900.21s -> 905.33s]  Alright, let's go, get that cooler!
[905.33s -> 908.40s]  Got that cube.
[908.40s -> 910.40s]  There's a sandbox somewhere that I need to dig in.
[910.40s -> 915.65s]  Where's the sandbox?
[915.65s -> 917.65s]  Switch to Eddie.
[923.98s -> 925.98s]  No, I went all the way back to the part of the hut.
[925.98s -> 927.98s]  You're horrible at this.
[927.98s -> 929.98s]  Well, come on, man!
[929.98s -> 931.98s]  I haven't even seen the show!
[932.16s -> 934.16s]  I don't know what's going on in this TV show.
[934.16s -> 936.16s]  How can I be good at the game if I've never seen the show?
[936.16s -> 940.13s]  Okay, I need a cat.
[940.13s -> 950.48s]  Cat, cat, cat.
[950.48s -> 952.48s]  Is there a cat?
[952.48s -> 954.48s]  Cat the tree?
[957.17s -> 960.63s]  I'll find a cat.
[960.63s -> 962.93s]  Alright, hold on.
[962.93s -> 964.93s]  No cat here, but I can dig in the sand.
[964.93s -> 974.98s]  Alright, that's Ed.
[974.98s -> 976.98s]  Ed's the one with 1D.
[978.98s -> 980.98s]  Costume piece.
[983.41s -> 987.41s]  I really feel like Eddie would do a great Smash Mouth impression.
[987.41s -> 989.41s]  Did he ever sing that song?
[989.41s -> 991.41s]  Any Smash Mouth songs?
[991.41s -> 993.41s]  I feel like he would be pretty good at it.
[993.41s -> 1002.31s]  Get that cat.
[1002.31s -> 1005.06s]  They did that once?
[1005.06s -> 1007.49s]  Yeah, I would assume. This is a cat, right?
[1007.49s -> 1019.09s]  Alright, well I got another puzzle piece.
[1019.09s -> 1021.09s]  Why don't they all jump in the air at the same time when you collect it?
[1021.09s -> 1023.09s]  35. Alright, let's keep going.
[1023.09s -> 1029.62s]  No Eds allowed.
[1029.62s -> 1031.62s]  That's alright, I'm Eddie.
[1031.80s -> 1036.54s]  Cutscene.
[1049.90s -> 1051.90s]  Violence only begets violence, Eddie.
[1051.90s -> 1053.90s]  Do it, man, come on.
[1053.90s -> 1055.90s]  Okay, let's go.
[1055.90s -> 1068.74s]  What?
[1068.74s -> 1072.07s]  R2 button?
[1072.07s -> 1074.07s]  You can go into the FPS mode? You kidding me?
[1074.07s -> 1081.18s]  Now jump on the picnic table and use Slingshot on Jimmy's dolls.
[1081.36s -> 1086.67s]  I can't go over there, though. Wait.
[1086.67s -> 1088.67s]  Is this a picnic table? This looks like just a plank of wood.
[1088.67s -> 1091.10s]  Alright, let's go.
[1091.10s -> 1096.73s]  How do I shoot it? Circle?
[1096.73s -> 1110.86s]  This bullet drop.
[1110.86s -> 1114.96s]  I did it, right?
[1114.96s -> 1117.20s]  How do I get out? Okay, let's go.
[1117.20s -> 1119.20s]  This is actually kind of fun.
[1119.20s -> 1121.20s]  I was talking a little shit at the beginning about how I was going to skip it.
[1121.20s -> 1123.20s]  But, it's not bad.
[1123.20s -> 1125.20s]  It's not bad.
[1125.20s -> 1130.70s]  I got 4 out of 5.
[1130.70s -> 1133.84s]  No, it's not bad. It's fun.
[1133.84s -> 1138.89s]  I mean, it could use a little work in the graphical department, but...
[1139.07s -> 1142.02s]  Nice!
[1142.02s -> 1144.02s]  Throw squirrels into the window of the house.
[1144.02s -> 1155.47s]  Why would I do that?
[1155.47s -> 1158.54s]  Like this house, right here.
[1158.54s -> 1162.64s]  No, yeah, I would have had it.
[1162.64s -> 1166.67s]  You got a fucking squirrel problem.
[1166.67s -> 1171.54s]  No, no, no, no, no, no!
[1171.54s -> 1173.54s]  Not the red squirrel! Get the red squirrel off me!
[1173.54s -> 1177.18s]  Get away from me!
[1177.18s -> 1179.18s]  No more red squirrel.
[1179.18s -> 1189.42s]  Dude, these stuff are...
[1189.42s -> 1191.42s]  They make cartoons...
[1191.42s -> 1193.42s]  Look at how good this cartoon was back in the day.
[1193.42s -> 1195.42s]  They had a whole orchestra.
[1195.60s -> 1200.80s]  They had a whole jazz orchestra playing these songs to each episode.
[1200.80s -> 1204.17s]  They make these goddamn songs on a computer now.
[1204.17s -> 1208.33s]  Who's the jazz orchestra?
[1208.33s -> 1215.24s]  There's a conductor.
[1215.24s -> 1218.24s]  And the special features of the Ed Edd and Eddie DVD.
[1218.24s -> 1226.88s]  You can see the whole orchestra play.
[1226.88s -> 1230.84s]  Uh, what?
[1230.84s -> 1233.52s]  How do you...
[1233.52s -> 1235.52s]  Listen, throw squirrels into the window of the house.
[1235.52s -> 1238.34s]  Isn't that what... Is this the wrong house?
[1238.34s -> 1240.34s]  What the fuck am I doing?
[1240.34s -> 1242.34s]  Why are we doing a cheerleading?
[1242.52s -> 1251.42s]  I think they'll do like a reunion episode.
[1251.42s -> 1253.42s]  When the actors come back, and they're a little too old,
[1253.42s -> 1255.78s]  and you can tell they're really trying.
[1255.78s -> 1257.78s]  But they don't really... They sound different.
[1259.78s -> 1262.47s]  For some reason, the Simpsons...
[1262.47s -> 1265.61s]  The Simpsons voice actors sound exactly the same
[1265.61s -> 1267.61s]  as they did 30 years ago.
[1267.61s -> 1269.61s]  It's insane.
[1269.61s -> 1273.06s]  It's insane.
[1273.06s -> 1278.25s]  The person that does Lisa...
[1278.25s -> 1280.25s]  Still is the exact same voice.
[1280.25s -> 1282.25s]  Prepare to major doom!
[1282.25s -> 1284.25s]  But Edd and Eddie...
[1284.43s -> 1288.27s]  But Edd and Eddie... They were fucking talented people.
[1288.27s -> 1290.27s]  It was really cool.
[1290.27s -> 1292.27s]  They did great jobs.
[1292.27s -> 1295.53s]  Two of them died. Oh god, that's terrible.
[1295.53s -> 1301.68s]  Wait, what was I supposed to...
[1301.68s -> 1309.80s]  Where am I taking the squirrel?
[1309.80s -> 1311.80s]  I forgot what to do already.
[1311.80s -> 1313.80s]  Yeah, I missed that cutscene because we were talking.
[1313.80s -> 1315.80s]  Well, I was talking.
[1315.80s -> 1317.80s]  You were watching me, uh...
[1317.80s -> 1319.80s]  Forget where I was going while I was talking.
[1319.80s -> 1324.03s]  That's not true.
[1324.03s -> 1329.28s]  Wait, what?
[1329.28s -> 1331.28s]  Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[1331.46s -> 1335.30s]  We were talking.
[1335.30s -> 1337.30s]  Lift and throw the fridge at the door.
[1337.30s -> 1339.30s]  Alright, let's throw it at the fridge.
[1339.30s -> 1342.11s]  Hoi!
[1342.11s -> 1344.11s]  Okay, use the battering head.
[1344.11s -> 1346.11s]  Let's throw it in here.
[1346.11s -> 1348.61s]  Okay, so let's do the battering head.
[1348.61s -> 1352.51s]  How do I stop doing this?
[1352.51s -> 1354.51s]  I got the pot.
[1360.29s -> 1362.29s]  What is this thing? A coin?
[1362.29s -> 1364.29s]  Ooh, I got two coins.
[1364.29s -> 1366.29s]  Three coins, four coins.
[1366.47s -> 1368.47s]  Three coins, four coins.
[1368.47s -> 1371.08s]  Oh, we did it.
[1371.08s -> 1373.76s]  That's it.
[1373.76s -> 1375.76s]  Let's do speedrun tactics, man.
[1375.76s -> 1379.86s]  This is faster.
[1379.86s -> 1381.86s]  Meatball machine.
[1397.17s -> 1399.17s]  He didn't really translate the 3D very well.
[1399.35s -> 1401.35s]  He's got a very strange mouth.
[1401.35s -> 1403.35s]  For 3D.
[1403.35s -> 1405.35s]  It looks like Bart.
[1405.35s -> 1408.49s]  That's like 55-year-old Bart Simpson.
[1408.49s -> 1410.49s]  Okay.
[1410.49s -> 1421.54s]  He is ugly.
[1421.54s -> 1424.04s]  Oh, pigs.
[1424.04s -> 1426.04s]  Batter and the pigs gate.
[1426.04s -> 1428.04s]  That should change Rolf's mind about the meatball.
[1445.54s -> 1447.54s]  Do I get to ride a pig?
[1447.54s -> 1449.78s]  Lift and throw the pigs back in the pen.
[1449.96s -> 1452.84s]  Okay.
[1452.84s -> 1454.84s]  Sounds easy enough.
[1454.84s -> 1459.58s]  I can't throw it over.
[1459.58s -> 1463.04s]  I do appreciate the default pig sound.
[1463.04s -> 1466.04s]  Is it just minigames?
[1466.04s -> 1469.18s]  Probably.
[1469.18s -> 1477.36s]  Oh, come on.
[1477.36s -> 1479.36s]  Will he just walk in?
[1479.36s -> 1481.36s]  There we go.
[1481.36s -> 1483.36s]  One more? Two more?
[1483.36s -> 1488.28s]  This game is worse than I remember.
[1488.28s -> 1490.28s]  I think it still holds up.
[1490.28s -> 1492.28s]  I mean, I never played it.
[1492.28s -> 1497.02s]  Let's use the machine.
[1497.20s -> 1502.51s]  Is there another pig?
[1502.51s -> 1506.80s]  Can we use the machine?
[1506.80s -> 1509.74s]  Is there another pig somewhere?
[1509.74s -> 1511.74s]  Oh, the fucking red squirrel got me again.
[1511.74s -> 1519.87s]  He said yes.
[1519.87s -> 1522.50s]  Well, how do I get on it?
[1522.50s -> 1524.50s]  Get the red squirrel away from me.
[1524.50s -> 1527.76s]  Does the smart one have to use it?
[1527.76s -> 1539.47s]  How do I get back in this house?
[1539.47s -> 1543.82s]  No, there's another pig here.
[1543.82s -> 1545.82s]  Look, can one of you party members just turn
[1545.82s -> 1554.14s]  and just fucking blast that squirrel?
[1556.14s -> 1558.77s]  See?
[1558.95s -> 1566.87s]  See?
[1566.87s -> 1571.73s]  Stop running out.
[1571.73s -> 1573.73s]  They just keep running out.
[1573.73s -> 1580.20s]  I gotta go in his fucking shed.
[1580.20s -> 1585.32s]  Alright, let's activate the meatball machine.
[1588.07s -> 1590.07s]  You just completed scam number one.
[1590.07s -> 1592.07s]  Cool your head.
[1592.07s -> 1594.69s]  10% game completion.
[1594.69s -> 1608.05s]  Fully animated?
[1608.05s -> 1619.76s]  Kind of.
[1619.76s -> 1622.52s]  Stop eating those.
[1622.52s -> 1624.52s]  Why did you just turn into Skeeter from Doug?
[1624.70s -> 1637.43s]  Col de Sac.
[1637.43s -> 1641.85s]  Okay, we got a sewer.
[1641.85s -> 1643.85s]  It's open world.
[1643.85s -> 1645.85s]  Leave the level and go.
[1645.85s -> 1647.85s]  No, not yet.
[1647.85s -> 1651.82s]  Let's really examine
[1651.82s -> 1654.12s]  the suburbs of Ohio.
[1654.12s -> 1656.12s]  I don't even know where the hell they are.
[1656.12s -> 1659.94s]  What town were they in?
[1659.94s -> 1663.72s]  Anything else I can do?
[1663.72s -> 1671.72s]  I can imagine being a big fan of this show
[1671.72s -> 1673.72s]  when it was really, really popular.
[1673.72s -> 1675.90s]  And walking around
[1675.90s -> 1677.90s]  and like going in Jimmy's pool
[1678.08s -> 1680.08s]  and being like, wow!
[1680.08s -> 1684.92s]  Talking to Ralph.
[1684.92s -> 1686.92s]  Picking up paint cans. They love painting, right?
[1688.92s -> 1691.87s]  That never said where?
[1691.87s -> 1693.87s]  Nah, let's just go to the next one.
[1693.87s -> 1698.16s]  This one's in the sewer.
[1698.16s -> 1700.16s]  This show fucking sucked. I'm glad it died.
[1700.16s -> 1703.48s]  Wow! That's heavy, man.
[1718.33s -> 1720.33s]  I know, I know!
[1720.33s -> 1722.33s]  We can crawl through the stinky sewers
[1722.33s -> 1724.33s]  like the bacteria fusing blob
[1724.33s -> 1726.33s]  and I was a teenage sludge hippie!
[1728.33s -> 1730.33s]  I don't know. It seems terribly risky
[1730.33s -> 1732.33s]  and unsanitary,
[1732.33s -> 1734.33s]  to say the least.
[1734.33s -> 1736.33s]  It'll be a cinch!
[1736.33s -> 1738.33s]  Come on, boys! We got a party to catch!
[1740.57s -> 1742.57s]  I like this. This is very fun.
[1742.57s -> 1744.57s]  Pin the tail on the ed.
[1744.57s -> 1753.85s]  The animation doesn't give
[1754.03s -> 1756.03s]  any V-Show animation justice.
[1756.03s -> 1758.34s]  Yeah, but it is a PlayStation 2 game.
[1760.34s -> 1765.52s]  Find the way into Jimmy's backyard.
[1770.58s -> 1772.58s]  Can you watch Ed Ed Nettie
[1772.58s -> 1774.58s]  with the whole thing anywhere?
[1774.58s -> 1777.20s]  Or do you have to buy the DVDs or Blu-Rays or something?
[1777.20s -> 1779.20s]  Is it possible to play this?
[1779.20s -> 1781.20s]  Not play this, but watch it?
[1781.20s -> 1783.20s]  I don't know.
[1783.20s -> 1785.20s]  It seems terribly risky
[1785.20s -> 1787.20s]  and unsanitary, to say the least.
[1787.20s -> 1789.20s]  Throw toxic waste?
[1789.38s -> 1791.38s]  Oh, shit. We're getting attacked by alligators.
[1795.63s -> 1798.44s]  The whole show is on YouTube.
[1798.44s -> 1800.44s]  What?
[1800.44s -> 1802.44s]  Well, I'm talking like a legal way to watch it.
[1802.44s -> 1805.45s]  Not like
[1805.45s -> 1807.45s]  Edfan2044
[1807.45s -> 1809.69s]  that uploads every video.
[1817.88s -> 1819.88s]  Oh, my God. Get the fucking out.
[1819.88s -> 1822.38s]  How do you kill the alligator?
[1822.38s -> 1828.33s]  Just dive through it.
[1828.33s -> 1830.33s]  They're not gonna throw you in prison
[1830.33s -> 1832.33s]  for watching a YouTube show.
[1832.51s -> 1834.51s]  It's elementary, Eddie.
[1834.51s -> 1837.26s]  If we move down to the other side,
[1837.26s -> 1839.26s]  you two can lift me up to that crack.
[1839.26s -> 1841.57s]  I'll lower the bridge, allowing us to cross together.
[1848.00s -> 1850.50s]  All right, switch to Ed and press L1
[1850.50s -> 1852.50s]  to enter Trampolad.
[1852.50s -> 1854.74s]  So we're gonna launch
[1854.74s -> 1856.74s]  Ed up there
[1856.74s -> 1859.17s]  to turn the dial.
[1859.17s -> 1862.82s]  Can we go in this?
[1862.82s -> 1864.82s]  Maybe we can.
[1865.00s -> 1867.00s]  Is it poison or is it just not an alligator?
[1869.68s -> 1872.05s]  All right, do it.
[1876.42s -> 1878.42s]  No, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna lose.
[1886.28s -> 1889.41s]  You're killing them.
[1889.41s -> 1895.11s]  I'm gonna take their souls.
[1895.11s -> 1897.11s]  What are they doing? Oh, their pathing is
[1897.11s -> 1899.11s]  getting up there.
[1899.11s -> 1901.11s]  Where's the most powerful technique?
[1901.11s -> 1904.12s]  I can throw the, okay,
[1904.12s -> 1911.80s]  the stink bomb. All right, watch out.
[1913.80s -> 1916.10s]  I'm gonna collect their souls.
[1916.10s -> 1918.10s]  No, no.
[1918.10s -> 1920.10s]  It's okay.
[1920.10s -> 1927.52s]  I don't think you can kill the alligators.
[1929.52s -> 1931.52s]  Maybe you can.
[1931.52s -> 1934.40s]  No, you definitely can't.
[1934.40s -> 1936.40s]  All right, all right, all right.
[1936.40s -> 1938.40s]  Okay, okay, easy, easy, easy.
[1938.40s -> 1941.28s]  I'm gonna have to, like,
[1941.28s -> 1943.28s]  battering ram that thing. Jesus Christ!
[1943.28s -> 1945.28s]  This thing is relentless!
[1945.28s -> 1949.83s]  Why is it still swimming on land?
[1949.83s -> 1953.86s]  That doesn't make any sense.
[1954.04s -> 1956.04s]  This is not fair. This is fucking unfair.
[1957.04s -> 1964.59s]  All right, battering ram this.
[1964.59s -> 1966.59s]  Battering ram.
[1966.59s -> 1968.59s]  Now I need a key.
[1968.59s -> 1974.86s]  All right, I have to get a key.
[1974.86s -> 1976.86s]  I'm just gonna throw the grenade.
[1976.86s -> 1978.86s]  Fuck it.
[1978.86s -> 1982.64s]  How do I throw the grenade?
[1982.64s -> 1986.16s]  There it is.
[1986.16s -> 1988.16s]  Okay.
[1988.16s -> 1990.16s]  I need a key to open this door.
[1990.16s -> 1995.79s]  I gotta go back.
[1995.79s -> 1997.79s]  Find key.
[1997.79s -> 2010.26s]  Key.
[2010.44s -> 2012.44s]  Why am I standing in?
[2017.68s -> 2019.68s]  Kill the alligators.
[2019.68s -> 2022.31s]  I don't think I can.
[2022.31s -> 2024.31s]  I hit them, like, three or four times.
[2024.31s -> 2027.44s]  They swim around like Aquaman,
[2027.44s -> 2029.44s]  and then you can't hurt them.
[2029.44s -> 2032.00s]  Let's try.
[2032.00s -> 2036.28s]  All right.
[2041.43s -> 2043.43s]  You can kill them.
[2043.43s -> 2045.43s]  All right, well, it's good to know.
[2045.43s -> 2047.43s]  I'm gonna find a key.
[2047.61s -> 2049.61s]  Oh, that was a coin.
[2054.94s -> 2056.94s]  Can I throw these as many times as I want?
[2056.94s -> 2060.53s]  I can.
[2060.53s -> 2062.53s]  Let's get infinity mode.
[2067.63s -> 2069.63s]  Well, he's the best character in the game.
[2069.63s -> 2073.54s]  All right. Key.
[2073.54s -> 2075.90s]  No key.
[2075.90s -> 2077.90s]  No key. In barrel. Boxes.
[2077.90s -> 2084.69s]  Toxic waste.
[2084.69s -> 2086.69s]  If I was a key, where would I be hiding?
[2086.69s -> 2094.05s]  Does anybody have anything to say about this?
[2094.05s -> 2098.34s]  That's the Dark Souls shortcut.
[2098.52s -> 2100.95s]  Nothing in there.
[2100.95s -> 2109.72s]  So they said switch to Ed.
[2114.32s -> 2116.32s]  Wait, what?
[2116.32s -> 2118.32s]  You can just open locked doors?
[2118.32s -> 2120.32s]  When did you possess this skill?
[2120.32s -> 2122.32s]  Yeah, Ed knows how to pick locks.
[2122.32s -> 2127.36s]  I thought there was a key.
[2127.36s -> 2130.82s]  What do you mean?
[2130.82s -> 2132.82s]  I thought that was a joke.
[2132.82s -> 2134.82s]  I thought there was a key involved.
[2134.82s -> 2143.00s]  That's double D.
[2143.00s -> 2145.00s]  You charlatan.
[2145.00s -> 2147.94s]  All right, well, what's that down there?
[2148.12s -> 2154.46s]  What's that down there?
[2154.46s -> 2157.46s]  Got it?
[2157.46s -> 2159.46s]  This looks like a real Ed level.
[2159.46s -> 2164.33s]  What would happen if he didn't have double D?
[2166.33s -> 2170.42s]  Would they just die?
[2170.42s -> 2173.62s]  This should work.
[2173.62s -> 2175.62s]  Why am I calling it double D?
[2175.62s -> 2177.62s]  It's Ed.
[2177.62s -> 2180.31s]  Edward.
[2187.46s -> 2189.77s]  Why would they just stand around?
[2189.77s -> 2193.22s]  Watch the show.
[2193.40s -> 2195.40s]  I've seen the show. I know the show.
[2195.40s -> 2197.40s]  I know about Plank.
[2197.40s -> 2199.40s]  Plank is his little friend.
[2199.40s -> 2201.40s]  Jimmy.
[2201.40s -> 2203.40s]  I know about
[2203.40s -> 2205.40s]  the sisters, right?
[2205.40s -> 2208.09s]  I've seen the show.
[2208.09s -> 2212.25s]  I know that they put jawbreakers
[2212.25s -> 2214.25s]  in their mouths.
[2214.25s -> 2217.00s]  All they care about is candy.
[2217.00s -> 2223.66s]  He's a fake fan.
[2223.66s -> 2226.73s]  Name your favorite episode.
[2226.73s -> 2229.23s]  I can't do that.
[2229.23s -> 2231.23s]  I got like a clam on me now.
[2231.41s -> 2236.21s]  I need to do something.
[2236.21s -> 2238.21s]  Who can touch these?
[2238.21s -> 2241.86s]  Favorite episode.
[2241.86s -> 2243.86s]  Favorite episode.
[2243.86s -> 2247.12s]  An episode of Ed, Edd, and Eddie
[2247.12s -> 2249.12s]  that I remember.
[2249.12s -> 2251.49s]  They got a super jawbreaker
[2251.49s -> 2253.49s]  one time, right?
[2253.49s -> 2261.10s]  It was a huge one.
[2261.10s -> 2263.10s]  I'm going to try as hard as I can.
[2263.10s -> 2268.35s]  What is an episode
[2268.35s -> 2270.35s]  of Ed, Ed, and Eddie that I've ever seen?
[2270.35s -> 2274.38s]  But I can't even do that.
[2274.38s -> 2276.38s]  I can't do that.
[2277.36s -> 2279.36s]  But I can't even do that with the Simpsons.
[2279.36s -> 2281.99s]  Right?
[2281.99s -> 2283.99s]  Okay, name a Simpsons episode.
[2283.99s -> 2285.99s]  Not like Treehouse of Horror.
[2285.99s -> 2291.68s]  I can't.
[2291.68s -> 2296.10s]  There we go.
[2296.10s -> 2300.77s]  We got some doors here.
[2300.77s -> 2303.52s]  Mr. Plow? Yeah, but that's
[2303.52s -> 2305.52s]  I guess like you just said that.
[2305.52s -> 2311.16s]  I didn't.
[2311.16s -> 2313.16s]  I'm trying. What is an episode of Ed, Ed, and Eddie
[2313.16s -> 2315.16s]  that I've ever seen?
[2315.16s -> 2317.33s]  I've seen a bunch of them a long time ago.
[2318.31s -> 2325.34s]  Did somebody
[2325.34s -> 2327.34s]  steal a plank one time and replace it
[2327.34s -> 2329.34s]  with another piece of wood?
[2329.34s -> 2334.70s]  No.
[2334.70s -> 2336.70s]  You sure?
[2339.06s -> 2341.06s]  Alright, I need to do something with the clam.
[2347.40s -> 2349.40s]  That didn't do anything.
[2356.74s -> 2359.62s]  Fuck!
[2359.62s -> 2361.62s]  Alright, hold on.
[2361.62s -> 2363.62s]  There's an Ed King back here.
[2372.90s -> 2374.90s]  Just who cares?
[2376.90s -> 2378.90s]  I'm gonna bring you over here. Just drown the clam.
[2383.56s -> 2385.56s]  Do it! Do it!
[2385.56s -> 2387.56s]  What's this like Tomb Raider bullshit? Like you gotta be right in front of it? Come on!
[2397.81s -> 2401.27s]  Alright, got it.
[2401.27s -> 2403.27s]  Chicken!
[2403.27s -> 2405.27s]  Chicken! Chicken!
[2405.27s -> 2412.76s]  I got it!
[2412.76s -> 2417.99s]  Bingo. Two out of six.
[2417.99s -> 2423.68s]  Alright, nothing else over here?
[2425.71s -> 2427.71s]  I can't name an episode.
[2427.71s -> 2432.26s]  An episode.
[2432.26s -> 2434.26s]  Even one plot device.
[2434.26s -> 2436.62s]  I don't know.
[2436.62s -> 2440.98s]  Get off me, please.
[2440.98s -> 2449.04s]  I'm just gonna farm HP.
[2449.04s -> 2452.82s]  I need a better, like an
[2452.82s -> 2454.82s]  attacker. Here we go.
[2454.82s -> 2458.72s]  Now you guys have given a lot of good
[2458.72s -> 2460.72s]  answers here, but those are not my answers.
[2460.72s -> 2468.19s]  Involved
[2468.19s -> 2479.12s]  in an episode.
[2479.12s -> 2485.20s]  Let me look around here.
[2485.20s -> 2487.20s]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[2487.20s -> 2490.08s]  No, you can't say next.
[2490.08s -> 2492.08s]  You can't do that yet.
[2492.08s -> 2494.08s]  Fuck, it's been forty-one minutes!
[2494.08s -> 2497.47s]  I can't
[2497.47s -> 2499.47s]  leave this game until I tell
[2499.47s -> 2501.47s]  you a Ed, Edd, and Eddie
[2501.47s -> 2503.47s]  plot device from one episode that I've ever seen.
[2503.47s -> 2505.47s]  I refuse.
[2505.47s -> 2508.93s]  I
[2508.93s -> 2510.93s]  would be upset at myself if I
[2510.93s -> 2516.94s]  didn't do that.
[2516.94s -> 2524.75s]  It's like a lever I have to pull.
[2524.75s -> 2528.21s]  He says that.
[2528.21s -> 2530.21s]  Is there one word like Ed
[2530.21s -> 2532.21s]  Is there one word like Ed is not smart?
[2532.21s -> 2534.21s]  He doesn't, like he gets like
[2534.21s -> 2536.45s]  dumb or something?
[2536.45s -> 2538.45s]  He's not that smart and they realize that they need his intelligence
[2538.45s -> 2541.07s]  or something?
[2541.07s -> 2548.50s]  He gets like dumb? Yes, yes.
[2548.50s -> 2551.95s]  No, I'm talking about like Double D.
[2551.95s -> 2553.95s]  Double D like loses his brain power or something, right?
[2553.95s -> 2555.95s]  Like gets his brain power dumb how
[2555.95s -> 2559.79s]  messed up? And they spend the whole episode
[2559.79s -> 2566.64s]  trying to get him smart again?
[2566.64s -> 2568.64s]  Or is that, was that, so Edd gets
[2568.64s -> 2570.64s]  really, no, Eddie, no, Edd,
[2570.64s -> 2572.64s]  this one, gets really smart in an
[2572.64s -> 2575.65s]  episode, right?
[2575.65s -> 2580.13s]  No.
[2580.13s -> 2582.13s]  Yes, I'm not stalling. I'm trying to figure
[2582.13s -> 2585.39s]  it out. I was right the first
[2585.39s -> 2587.39s]  time. Alright, so I can stop playing then.
[2587.39s -> 2591.30s]  Thanks for watching. No, I'm kidding.
[2591.30s -> 2593.66s]  I can't leave until I open this
[2593.66s -> 2598.14s]  door. What about like the Edd Ram?
[2598.14s -> 2607.17s]  No, I eBayed. I
[2607.17s -> 2609.17s]  eBayed this game. You think I'm just gonna stop playing it?
[2609.17s -> 2612.24s]  I had to buy this on eBay.
[2612.24s -> 2614.67s]  It took three
[2614.67s -> 2617.10s]  weeks to get here. It was
[2617.10s -> 2621.52s]  78 bucks total.
[2621.52s -> 2624.40s]  I'm kidding. It's a lie. How do I do this?
[2624.40s -> 2632.78s]  Am I missing
[2632.78s -> 2634.78s]  something here? Am I missing
[2634.78s -> 2640.48s]  an episode?
[2640.48s -> 2645.41s]  I have to switch to Edd. How do I
[2645.41s -> 2647.41s]  get such bad deals? I'm just kidding. This was not
[2647.41s -> 2649.41s]  80 bucks. He's blind.
[2649.41s -> 2651.97s]  Wait.
[2651.97s -> 2653.97s]  Maybe I am. Maybe I am.
[2653.97s -> 2655.97s]  What do I have to do with Edd?
[2655.97s -> 2657.97s]  Touch this thing? The like elephant trunk?
[2657.97s -> 2659.97s]  Grab the elephant trunk and spin it.
[2659.97s -> 2666.42s]  Oh, come on.
[2666.42s -> 2668.42s]  Look, hold on a minute.
[2668.42s -> 2670.42s]  This is like, how many pizzas are there here?
[2670.42s -> 2672.42s]  There's at least five
[2672.42s -> 2674.42s]  pizza-shaped things here. Look, there's one here.
[2674.42s -> 2676.42s]  There's the elephant trunk that I made
[2676.42s -> 2681.34s]  before I mentioned.
[2681.34s -> 2683.34s]  It's only glowing when
[2683.34s -> 2685.34s]  you have Edd selected.
[2685.34s -> 2687.34s]  And I had my favorite character, which is
[2687.34s -> 2689.34s]  Eddie, selected. So it doesn't
[2689.34s -> 2691.97s]  light up. You get it?
[2691.97s -> 2695.94s]  It only lights up when you have the person
[2695.94s -> 2708.03s]  that can do the reactions selected.
[2708.03s -> 2710.03s]  My favorite part about Edd and Eddie is nothing to do
[2710.03s -> 2712.03s]  with the show. It's when the guy
[2712.03s -> 2714.03s]  goes...
[2714.03s -> 2716.98s]  After that happens, I just turn to the channel.
[2716.98s -> 2727.92s]  I change the channel. I went in a fucking
[2727.92s -> 2731.87s]  circle.
[2731.87s -> 2733.87s]  I can't like, talk. Stop talking.
[2733.87s -> 2738.22s]  Frankly, I'm disgusted.
[2738.22s -> 2740.22s]  You don't know which Edd you are. I know exactly which
[2740.22s -> 2746.82s]  Edd I am.
[2746.82s -> 2748.82s]  Was there an episode where one of their cousins
[2748.82s -> 2751.76s]  like Fred showed up?
[2751.76s -> 2753.76s]  Do I get bonus points for that one?
[2753.76s -> 2758.11s]  Weren't there three other like
[2758.11s -> 2760.11s]  Edd, Edd, and Eddie? Oh, fuck.
[2760.11s -> 2762.11s]  No, I'm fine. There are three
[2762.11s -> 2764.11s]  other Edd, Edd, and Eddie's that show up in an episode, right?
[2764.11s -> 2773.26s]  No, not the girls.
[2773.26s -> 2783.62s]  Okay, easy.
[2783.62s -> 2785.62s]  Wait, didn't I...
[2785.62s -> 2789.20s]  Hold on. Did I...
[2789.20s -> 2791.95s]  Where's my map?
[2791.95s -> 2793.95s]  Where's my map?
[2793.95s -> 2795.95s]  I need to press select and see like the coordinates
[2795.95s -> 2800.82s]  of where I am.
[2800.82s -> 2802.82s]  Where's my dungeon map?
[2802.82s -> 2805.82s]  How come you don't have one of those, Edd?
[2805.82s -> 2807.82s]  Okay, remember this? Yep, yep, yep.
[2807.82s -> 2812.18s]  Alright.
[2812.18s -> 2814.61s]  I can't take this laugh anymore.
[2814.61s -> 2816.61s]  Alright, then I had the rats here.
[2816.61s -> 2818.61s]  And then that door.
[2818.61s -> 2820.61s]  Is there... Okay, wait. Is there...
[2820.61s -> 2822.61s]  Can I open this?
[2822.61s -> 2824.61s]  Is there like another blind moment?
[2824.61s -> 2826.61s]  See, what about this one?
[2826.61s -> 2829.68s]  I can't use that one.
[2829.68s -> 2831.68s]  What about... I'm just checking. I'm just checking to make sure I don't...
[2831.68s -> 2833.68s]  Fuck it up. Look at that.
[2843.71s -> 2845.71s]  Why does he keep laughing? Because things are funny.
[2845.71s -> 2847.71s]  Some things are funny.
[2851.71s -> 2856.38s]  Don't lose here.
[2858.38s -> 2860.38s]  They're blocking the way.
[2860.38s -> 2862.38s]  I feel like I'm really neglecting
[2862.38s -> 2864.38s]  the single Edd, right? No, double Edd.
[2864.38s -> 2866.38s]  No, the Eddie.
[2866.38s -> 2868.38s]  Two syllable Edd.
[2868.38s -> 2870.88s]  I'm neglecting him.
[2877.41s -> 2879.90s]  That's a tough pole here.
[2879.90s -> 2883.04s]  Got it. Nice.
[2883.04s -> 2885.41s]  I'm like a fucking lightning rod right now.
[2885.41s -> 2887.41s]  That was fucking so hard.
[2894.38s -> 2897.97s]  Next. Next. No!
[2900.14s -> 2902.14s]  Not until I... Edd Batteringram!
[2907.20s -> 2910.53s]  Let's Edd break that, right?
[2913.52s -> 2915.52s]  Secret room?
[2915.52s -> 2917.70s]  No, alligator.
[2925.70s -> 2927.70s]  Connect the names with the right characters or fake fans.
[2927.70s -> 2929.70s]  Sure.
[2929.70s -> 2934.54s]  Okay. By the way,
[2934.54s -> 2936.54s]  I never told you I was a fan of this show.
[2936.54s -> 2938.54s]  I told you I've seen the show and that I thought it was okay.
[2938.54s -> 2940.54s]  I thought it was great.
[2940.54s -> 2942.72s]  Let's start from the beginning.
[2942.72s -> 2944.72s]  This is Edd with two Ds. This is double D.
[2944.72s -> 2947.98s]  This is
[2947.98s -> 2949.98s]  E-D-D-Y. Eddie.
[2949.98s -> 2951.98s]  And this is E-D.
[2951.98s -> 2954.61s]  Edd.
[2954.61s -> 2956.61s]  They're corrected.
[2959.30s -> 2963.01s]  Something else in here I can do.
[2963.01s -> 2965.50s]  And then
[2965.50s -> 2967.87s]  somebody...
[2967.87s -> 2970.24s]  Didn't somebody...
[2970.24s -> 2973.31s]  DW?
[2973.31s -> 2976.32s]  Is it like one of these Edds like...
[2976.32s -> 2978.32s]  No, that's Arthur.
[2984.70s -> 2987.90s]  Edd-D-W.
[2987.90s -> 2989.90s]  No, that's the intro in Arthur.
[2989.90s -> 2992.53s]  What happened to that show?
[2992.53s -> 2996.75s]  You play for long and you unlock
[2996.75s -> 2998.75s]  the secret fourth Edd.
[2998.75s -> 3000.75s]  Yeah. Nice fake fan,
[3000.75s -> 3002.75s]  by the way.
[3002.75s -> 3013.23s]  Remember, like,
[3013.23s -> 3015.23s]  name the characters correctly or you're a fake fan.
[3015.23s -> 3017.23s]  What about the guy who just said there's a fourth Edd?
[3017.23s -> 3019.66s]  What are we going to say about that guy?
[3019.66s -> 3028.18s]  Oh, nice. Job record.
[3028.18s -> 3031.49s]  Is that a secret?
[3031.49s -> 3033.66s]  There's 40 of those.
[3033.66s -> 3039.36s]  Judge Dredd.
[3042.69s -> 3046.14s]  Ten years, punk.
[3049.14s -> 3051.14s]  The fourth Edd. Judge Dredd.
[3053.82s -> 3055.82s]  Dredd, Edd, Edd, and Eddie.
[3055.82s -> 3057.82s]  Edd, Dredd,
[3057.82s -> 3061.86s]  Edd, Edd, Dredd, and Eddie.
[3083.06s -> 3085.06s]  I was...
[3085.06s -> 3087.06s]  I can't do...
[3087.06s -> 3089.06s]  I can't say that.
[3089.06s -> 3091.06s]  It's too dumb.
[3091.06s -> 3094.45s]  Somebody already did it. I'm not doing it.
[3100.72s -> 3112.69s]  Alright. Turn the valves to lower the water level.
[3112.69s -> 3115.31s]  Okay!
[3115.31s -> 3122.66s]  I need that.
[3122.66s -> 3124.66s]  New valves over here.
[3124.66s -> 3126.66s]  Oh, Edd's dead.
[3126.66s -> 3129.54s]  Edd's dead. Sorry, Edd.
[3129.54s -> 3133.12s]  Somebody said loser.
[3133.12s -> 3135.68s]  No, no, no. Get off.
[3135.68s -> 3137.68s]  Edd fell in the water.
[3137.68s -> 3150.03s]  And he was never heard from again.
[3150.03s -> 3154.06s]  He fart-joked.
[3154.06s -> 3156.06s]  You guys are acting like I made that joke.
[3156.06s -> 3158.69s]  I didn't.
[3158.69s -> 3163.74s]  What the hell was that? Was that Coraline?
[3163.74s -> 3166.05s]  Coraline! Open the door!
[3166.05s -> 3168.05s]  Don't tuck them all in there!
[3168.05s -> 3170.74s]  Get out of there!
[3170.74s -> 3182.75s]  It's not what it seems!
[3182.75s -> 3188.90s]  Okay, there's one. The water's going down.
[3188.90s -> 3193.36s]  There's one over there.
[3193.36s -> 3196.94s]  Okay. Easy.
[3196.94s -> 3199.89s]  Edd. Eddie.
[3199.89s -> 3202.38s]  Do I throw somebody?
[3204.38s -> 3206.38s]  Is that it?
[3206.38s -> 3208.38s]  Where's one of the valves?
[3208.38s -> 3210.38s]  We gotta get down there.
[3210.38s -> 3216.13s]  I can't tell. It's kind of blurry.
[3216.13s -> 3218.13s]  Can I throw him?
[3218.13s -> 3222.22s]  There's not one.
[3222.22s -> 3228.82s]  Please stop this game already.
[3228.82s -> 3230.82s]  No, why?
[3230.82s -> 3232.82s]  It's fun.
[3232.82s -> 3237.49s]  I'm begging you. I'm starving.
[3237.49s -> 3239.92s]  Let me at least get to the end of this.
[3239.92s -> 3241.92s]  This is a fun game.
[3241.92s -> 3244.10s]  Well, I obviously have to go down there.
[3244.10s -> 3246.10s]  Is there one over there?
[3249.74s -> 3251.74s]  I don't know who that was.
[3251.74s -> 3253.74s]  That was just Carrot Top.
[3253.74s -> 3255.74s]  I still have a clam on me.
[3257.74s -> 3260.93s]  We're starved for good content.
[3262.93s -> 3264.93s]  Come on.
[3264.93s -> 3266.93s]  You don't like this?
[3266.93s -> 3269.62s]  Alright.
[3269.62s -> 3271.62s]  This is one of the most requested video games
[3271.62s -> 3273.62s]  I've ever had on the channel.
[3273.62s -> 3275.86s]  You asked me
[3275.86s -> 3277.86s]  to make you scrambled eggs
[3277.86s -> 3279.86s]  with like cheese in it.
[3279.86s -> 3281.86s]  Pepper, onions. I sit there all day
[3281.86s -> 3283.86s]  and I'm at the stove and I'm cooking all these
[3283.86s -> 3285.86s]  weird eggs you ordered. You want like
[3285.86s -> 3287.86s]  hollandaise on it too. I'm like really?
[3287.86s -> 3289.86s]  You want like hollandaise sauce?
[3289.86s -> 3291.86s]  Yeah. And then I put this fucking
[3291.86s -> 3293.86s]  meal in front of you and you're like
[3293.86s -> 3295.86s]  I don't like the way that smells.
[3295.86s -> 3297.86s]  Get rid of it. And I'm like I just
[3297.86s -> 3299.86s]  I thought you wanted this. You wanted eggs with hollandaise.
[3299.86s -> 3303.50s]  And then like the rest of the families
[3303.50s -> 3306.19s]  at the table.
[3306.19s -> 3308.19s]  Like the 300 family members that I have.
[3308.19s -> 3310.19s]  I wanted pancakes.
[3310.19s -> 3312.19s]  And I'm just like I don't have
[3312.19s -> 3314.19s]  the materials for pancakes right now.
[3314.19s -> 3316.19s]  Get them mom.
[3316.19s -> 3318.19s]  I can't. The store's closed.
[3318.19s -> 3320.19s]  And then you back up and you
[3320.19s -> 3323.90s]  walk out. You like go to
[3323.90s -> 3329.22s]  your room. No.
[3329.22s -> 3331.22s]  Mom made what mom made. If you don't like it
[3331.22s -> 3333.22s]  then that's too bad.
[3333.22s -> 3335.22s]  You gotta eat it.
[3335.22s -> 3337.22s]  It's got broccoli. It's got spinach in it.
[3337.22s -> 3339.22s]  Spinach. It's gonna make you grow up big and strong.
[3339.22s -> 3341.22s]  Ed Ed and Eddie will make you grow up big and strong.
[3341.22s -> 3343.22s]  As long as you don't. Hold on.
[3343.22s -> 3348.51s]  I'm gonna die.
[3348.51s -> 3350.94s]  I gotta get up there.

[3353.89s -> 3357.60s]  Come on. Get me up there.
[3357.60s -> 3363.04s]  This one fucking clam.
[3363.04s -> 3367.33s]  No!
[3367.33s -> 3369.82s]  How do I like close
[3369.82s -> 3374.18s]  the clams mouth?
[3374.18s -> 3376.35s]  That's it. Alright.
[3376.35s -> 3380.30s]  I beat it.
[3380.30s -> 3382.86s]  Alright Jimmy. Let's go.
[3382.86s -> 3384.86s]  You don't get killed by a clam but I do.
[3384.86s -> 3392.72s]  Alright.
[3392.72s -> 3398.46s]  Now what? Drawbreaker.
[3404.21s -> 3406.21s]  I'm just kidding man. Don't worry.
[3406.21s -> 3408.77s]  Do what you want. Ignore the chat.
[3408.77s -> 3410.77s]  I'm just playing around.
[3410.77s -> 3412.77s]  I know you guys are too.
[3412.77s -> 3414.77s]  Don't worry. I know you guys really do love Ed Ed and Eddie.
[3416.77s -> 3418.77s]  I know you do. That's why I'm gonna keep playing.
[3418.77s -> 3420.77s]  Jimmy what's wrong with you?
[3420.77s -> 3422.77s]  Jimmy. Walk down here.
[3422.77s -> 3424.77s]  Oh no.
[3424.77s -> 3427.63s]  Please don't come back to do it again.
[3427.63s -> 3431.47s]  Okay. We're good.
[3431.47s -> 3437.54s]  Jimmy what do you want?
[3437.54s -> 3439.71s]  Jimmy. Hello.
[3454.59s -> 3459.39s]  Um. Where do I go?
[3459.39s -> 3461.39s]  Down here?
[3461.39s -> 3471.04s]  Take the valve.
[3471.04s -> 3474.05s]  Do you just leave it up there?
[3474.05s -> 3480.45s]  Oh.
[3482.75s -> 3487.04s]  Your best pal.
[3487.04s -> 3492.16s]  So how about that valve Johnny?
[3492.16s -> 3495.47s]  Bring it on you.
[3495.47s -> 3497.47s]  Just give us the valve and I'll give you a plank.
[3497.47s -> 3499.47s]  Plank says you are tricky.
[3499.47s -> 3505.42s]  Double D. Let's install that valve
[3505.42s -> 3507.42s]  and we're done with it.
[3507.42s -> 3509.42s]  No I made that valve. I installed that valve.
[3509.42s -> 3522.99s]  I did that.
[3522.99s -> 3524.99s]  Why are you guys writing gay band?
[3524.99s -> 3534.00s]  Where's the gay band coming from?
[3534.00s -> 3536.00s]  The rods are bigger. They're getting thicker.
[3536.00s -> 3539.65s]  Oh it's cause of the
[3539.65s -> 3541.65s]  valve thing right?
[3541.65s -> 3545.79s]  People still making that joke
[3545.79s -> 3547.79s]  in like 2019.
[3547.79s -> 3549.79s]  Like the gay band.
[3549.79s -> 3551.79s]  I'm still getting that reference and joke
[3551.79s -> 3553.79s]  in 2019.
[3553.79s -> 3555.79s]  We are?
[3555.79s -> 3558.59s]  No we're not.
[3558.59s -> 3567.15s]  He's here.
[3567.15s -> 3569.15s]  Everybody hates valve.
[3569.15s -> 3571.15s]  That's not true. They got three VR
[3571.15s -> 3573.15s]  games coming up. That's what I heard.
[3577.52s -> 3581.23s]  What would you guys do if I just turned on the webcam right now
[3581.23s -> 3583.23s]  and just fucking sprinted out of the room
[3583.23s -> 3585.23s]  and in the chair like I was
[3585.23s -> 3587.23s]  just clicking around and I ran out of the room
[3587.23s -> 3589.23s]  and Gabe Newell's in the chair.
[3589.23s -> 3591.23s]  Here. And he started talking about his favorite
[3593.23s -> 3598.48s]  What would that be worth?
[3605.44s -> 3607.44s]  And by the way he's getting the
[3607.44s -> 3609.44s]  names wrong. Would you guys still say that shit?
[3609.44s -> 3611.44s]  To Gabe Newell?
[3611.44s -> 3613.44s]  I really like how Ed
[3613.44s -> 3615.44s]  he's the tall one right?
[3615.44s -> 3617.44s]  With two D's. Everyone would be like
[3617.44s -> 3627.81s]  idiot. No you wouldn't.
[3627.81s -> 3635.62s]  I've heard of diversion. So I have to break the trampolines.
[3635.62s -> 3640.48s]  I mean break the
[3640.48s -> 3644.38s]  pinatas. Where are the pinatas?
[3644.38s -> 3646.38s]  Because we
[3646.38s -> 3648.38s]  like Gabe
[3648.38s -> 3650.38s]  Newell.
[3650.38s -> 3652.38s]  Okay you can chop.
[3652.38s -> 3665.31s]  Because we like Gabe
[3665.31s -> 3667.31s]  Newell.
[3667.31s -> 3669.31s]  I'm mean.
[3669.31s -> 3671.31s]  And I'm not going to stand for it.
[3671.31s -> 3678.14s]  Crap.
[3678.14s -> 3681.09s]  I mean this area does.
[3681.09s -> 3686.34s]  This is a Playstation 2 game.
[3686.34s -> 3688.34s]  Come on.
[3688.34s -> 3697.42s]  He's like the Phil's very
[3697.42s -> 3701.52s]  dope boy.
[3701.52s -> 3705.55s]  He's making me laugh.
[3705.55s -> 3715.73s]  Cutscene incoming.
[3721.73s -> 3726.78s]  What are they called? The Grunge Sisters?
[3726.78s -> 3739.71s]  Fake fan. Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
[3739.71s -> 3741.89s]  Hold on. Wait. I didn't know
[3741.89s -> 3744.70s]  I have to go. Beehives.
[3744.70s -> 3750.21s]  Shoot the beehives. Pop a fridge on them?
[3750.21s -> 3754.75s]  Alright.
[3754.75s -> 3756.93s]  This reminds me of those
[3756.93s -> 3758.93s]  old flash games.
[3758.93s -> 3762.96s]  I'm dead.
[3762.96s -> 3764.96s]  I gotta like time it when they run across the screen.
[3764.96s -> 3769.44s]  Because I can't hit them with this.
[3769.44s -> 3771.44s]  Stun stun stun.
[3771.44s -> 3775.34s]  Right there. Right there.
[3775.34s -> 3777.90s]  Get it. Bingo.
[3777.90s -> 3779.90s]  Right here.
[3779.90s -> 3786.03s]  No I can't. Oh she was standing
[3786.03s -> 3788.03s]  right there. Right here. Right at this one.
[3788.03s -> 3790.03s]  Drop a fridge on her head.
[3790.03s -> 3793.09s]  Got it.
[3795.09s -> 3798.78s]  Back into the sewer.
[3798.78s -> 3803.58s]  Oh god.
[3803.58s -> 3808.62s]  Did I get it?
[3808.62s -> 3810.62s]  I don't think I got it.
[3810.62s -> 3815.42s]  That's a laugh.
[3815.42s -> 3817.73s]  That laugh is driving me crazy.
[3817.73s -> 3828.35s]  There's more.
[3828.35s -> 3830.59s]  All the way down.
[3830.59s -> 3837.74s]  Get it.
[3837.74s -> 3842.21s]  Don't do the laugh.
[3842.21s -> 3844.64s]  Please.
[3844.64s -> 3850.14s]  And then right here. Shit. Drop it on her head.
[3850.14s -> 3852.14s]  Got it. No I didn't.
[3852.14s -> 3857.95s]  Got it. You just completed
[3857.95s -> 3859.95s]  this game too. Pin the tail on the head. Current game
[3859.95s -> 3867.38s]  19%.
[3867.38s -> 3873.84s]  Animatic cutscene.
[3873.84s -> 3876.21s]  Too bad the party is over dorks.
[3876.21s -> 3878.21s]  Miniclips gave 50 bucks.
[3878.21s -> 3882.82s]  Are you kidding me? I'm Jimmy.
[3882.82s -> 3884.82s]  There's gotta be some cake left right?
[3884.82s -> 3886.82s]  Here.
[3886.82s -> 3888.82s]  You can lick the icing from my candle.
[3888.82s -> 3895.58s]  Gross.
[3895.58s -> 3898.85s]  What was that face? That didn't even look like him.
[3898.85s -> 3901.92s]  Miniclips gave 50 bucks.
[3901.92s -> 3903.92s]  Thank you for the 50 dollars
[3903.92s -> 3906.48s]  Miniclips. Local streamer

[3945.62s -> 3950.80s]  Alright let's keep going.
[3950.80s -> 3953.23s]  Is that what it feels like?
[3953.23s -> 3955.54s]  No please.
[3955.54s -> 3957.54s]  Just, you're gonna have to wait.
[3957.54s -> 3959.54s]  Okay. I gotta do

[3987.31s -> 3989.31s]  Jimmy's birthday
[3993.87s -> 3995.87s]  Did Jimmy have a birthday every day?
[3995.87s -> 3997.87s]  It's his second birthday in a row.
[3997.87s -> 3999.87s]  That's what we're banned from.
[4005.52s -> 4007.52s]  It's his crown hog day.
[4007.52s -> 4009.52s]  I did something wrong. I have to correct it.
[4012.14s -> 4014.14s]  The world is trying to teach me
[4014.14s -> 4016.58s]  something.
[4016.58s -> 4023.30s]  Oh okay.
[4023.30s -> 4025.30s]  Jerma, I'm actually gonna leave.
[4025.30s -> 4028.88s]  Well I
[4028.88s -> 4033.04s]  can't stop you.
[4033.04s -> 4042.38s]  Exit of the cul-de-sac.
[4042.38s -> 4046.42s]  Come on we got three days
[4046.42s -> 4048.42s]  in a row to do
[4048.42s -> 4050.42s]  just let me enjoy my video game.
[4050.42s -> 4053.23s]  This is
[4053.23s -> 4057.14s]  $150 for me to buy this.
[4057.14s -> 4059.14s]  This shady guy, I had to like go meet him
[4059.14s -> 4061.14s]  in like a fucking alleyway.
[4061.14s -> 4063.14s]  You wanted an Eddie?
[4063.14s -> 4065.14s]  Yeah man like I heard from
[4065.14s -> 4067.14s]  Craigslist you were selling that Eddie?
[4067.14s -> 4069.14s]  Yeah.
[4069.14s -> 4071.50s]  You wanted anything else?
[4071.50s -> 4073.87s]  No just Ed, Edd, and Eddie.
[4073.87s -> 4075.87s]  Like five guys like kind of appeared
[4075.87s -> 4077.87s]  out of the shadows with like huge leather jackets on
[4077.87s -> 4079.87s]  and they had like spiked clubs and stuff.
[4079.87s -> 4083.58s]  They're like surrounding me.
[4083.58s -> 4085.58s]  I just gave the guy a fucking wad of hundreds
[4085.58s -> 4098.69s]  and walked away and he gave me the disc.
[4098.69s -> 4104.77s]  What's over here?
[4104.77s -> 4106.77s]  Okay here we go, a new place.
[4106.77s -> 4108.77s]  Yeah and then I heard something behind me as I was walking
[4108.77s -> 4110.77s]  to my car, the fucking Lamborghini by the way.
[4110.77s -> 4112.77s]  It's a beautiful car.
[4112.77s -> 4114.77s]  And I'm just kind of swinging my keys around
[4114.77s -> 4116.77s]  just like kind of a little nervous.
[4116.77s -> 4118.77s]  I hear like you know footsteps behind me.
[4118.77s -> 4121.01s]  And they got close enough
[4121.01s -> 4123.01s]  where I was able to
[4123.01s -> 4125.01s]  I was able to change
[4125.01s -> 4127.01s]  my hair in
[4127.01s -> 4129.01s]  like five minutes my hair changed.
[4129.01s -> 4131.01s]  It was weird because the guy was behind me but I noticed
[4131.01s -> 4133.01s]  that my hair changed completely.
[4133.01s -> 4135.01s]  I heard the steps.
[4135.01s -> 4137.01s]  Grabbed the guy in a fucking stone cold stone headlock
[4137.01s -> 4139.38s]  and then flipped him.
[4139.38s -> 4141.38s]  Alright well I just broke my head.
[4141.38s -> 4145.54s]  That's it.
[4145.54s -> 4148.61s]  Where's the thing that was on it?
[4148.61s -> 4151.87s]  I can't even use this.
[4151.87s -> 4154.94s]  I ripped off the thing
[4154.94s -> 4164.80s]  that was on it.
[4164.80s -> 4166.80s]  There was like a piece of jelly that was attached to it and now
[4166.80s -> 4168.80s]  I don't know where it is.
[4168.80s -> 4173.65s]  I can't even use the headphones now.
[4173.65s -> 4175.65s]  I got it.
[4175.65s -> 4181.39s]  Everything's fine.
[4181.39s -> 4183.39s]  I got it. See?
[4183.39s -> 4185.39s]  Everything's just fine.
[4185.39s -> 4188.21s]  There it is.
[4188.21s -> 4190.21s]  Don't worry about it. Everything's fine.
[4190.21s -> 4193.66s]  If that may have already been like that.
[4193.66s -> 4197.95s]  I don't know. Which ear is this for?
[4197.95s -> 4205.82s]  There's earwax on it. That's not earwax.
[4205.82s -> 4207.82s]  There's a hair on it.
[4207.82s -> 4210.58s]  What do you say earwax?
[4210.58s -> 4213.82s]  Buddy.
[4213.82s -> 4215.82s]  There's hair all over this though. That's like dog hair.
[4215.82s -> 4217.82s]  That's not my hair.
[4217.82s -> 4220.58s]  Let's try to reattach this.
[4220.58s -> 4231.58s]  This one.
[4231.58s -> 4239.46s]  There's hair all over me.
[4239.46s -> 4241.46s]  You put earbuds in your dog's ears?
[4241.46s -> 4243.46s]  No. What?
[4243.46s -> 4257.66s]  No this is the wrong one.
[4257.66s -> 4264.32s]  Alright.
[4264.32s -> 4266.32s]  Good as new.
[4266.32s -> 4269.78s]  See? This is supposed to be attached.
[4269.78s -> 4271.78s]  But whatever. It goes in here.
[4271.78s -> 4274.27s]  The jelly. I can just stuff it in there.
[4274.27s -> 4281.06s]  We're fine. Everything's good.
[4281.06s -> 4288.16s]  It's like a hearing aid.
[4288.16s -> 4290.16s]  Leave the cam on? I don't want to.
[4307.10s -> 4309.10s]  I'm laughing at that.
[4309.10s -> 4318.00s]  It's funny.
[4318.00s -> 4320.24s]  Must be something IED.
[4320.24s -> 4324.53s]  Wow. I didn't know what that was until
[4324.53s -> 4326.53s]  it was revealed.
[4326.53s -> 4328.53s]  Get to the candy store fast
[4328.53s -> 4330.53s]  for free jawbreakers.
[4330.53s -> 4336.67s]  I don't think you said
[4336.67s -> 4339.55s]  it wasn't kill squirrels.
[4342.94s -> 4346.26s]  How do I get out of my backyard?
[4346.26s -> 4349.33s]  Do the edge jump?
[4349.33s -> 4351.33s]  No, no, no.
[4351.33s -> 4355.23s]  The jump.
[4355.23s -> 4358.82s]  Episode was it?
[4358.82s -> 4366.99s]  No. I have to jump on this.
[4366.99s -> 4371.28s]  Oops.
[4371.28s -> 4378.62s]  How am I not annoyed by the game?
[4378.62s -> 4381.76s]  I don't know.
[4381.76s -> 4384.83s]  I don't know.
[4384.83s -> 4386.83s]  Why the hell are you still playing?
[4386.83s -> 4388.83s]  I don't know. I don't know.
[4388.83s -> 4390.83s]  Why not? I don't know.
[4396.85s -> 4401.06s]  I don't know.
[4401.06s -> 4403.06s]  How do I get out of my backyard?
[4403.06s -> 4408.56s]  I'm going to jump on this.
[4414.02s -> 4417.98s]  Go through the house.
[4417.98s -> 4420.29s]  I can't open the door.
[4420.29s -> 4424.96s]  The door doesn't open.
[4424.96s -> 4426.96s]  Break the door.
[4426.96s -> 4428.96s]  I can't smash the door.
[4428.96s -> 4435.66s]  Maybe bash this?
[4435.66s -> 4437.66s]  Ooh, baby.
[4437.66s -> 4439.97s]  What did you look at that?
[4439.97s -> 4441.97s]  So anyway, the guy comes up behind me
[4441.97s -> 4443.97s]  and I fucking, I'm right in his fucking head.
[4443.97s -> 4447.74s]  You know what I mean?
[4447.74s -> 4449.74s]  Don't fucking look at my armpit hair.
[4449.74s -> 4451.74s]  I swear to God I'll be mad at you.
[4457.07s -> 4460.27s]  Look, it's the winter time, okay?
[4460.27s -> 4462.27s]  I clean up.
[4462.27s -> 4464.27s]  It's cold. I don't like
[4464.27s -> 4467.86s]  to wear tank tops.
[4467.86s -> 4469.86s]  I clean up. I do a little bit of maintenance.
[4469.86s -> 4471.86s]  It's goddamn
[4471.86s -> 4478.26s]  February, alright?
[4478.26s -> 4488.94s]  The Tower of Ed.
[4488.94s -> 4490.94s]  Make fun of that for one second.
[4490.94s -> 4494.85s]  I swear to God I'll never stream again.
[4494.85s -> 4496.85s]  You're going to see my face again?
[4496.85s -> 4499.22s]  Has anyone ever actually said something like that?
[4499.22s -> 4508.88s]  This is actually really hard.
[4508.88s -> 4510.88s]  Again.
[4510.88s -> 4524.96s]  I'm telling you.
[4524.96s -> 4526.96s]  This is really difficult.
[4526.96s -> 4528.96s]  You're never going to see me again.
[4528.96s -> 4534.59s]  Um, guys.
[4534.59s -> 4536.59s]  Guys, guys, guys. Guys, it's hard.
[4536.59s -> 4539.34s]  Guys, I'm telling you.
[4539.34s -> 4541.34s]  This might look bad. It's going to look really bad.
[4541.34s -> 4543.34s]  You're going to think I'm an idiot.
[4543.34s -> 4545.34s]  I'm telling you, once I get to this hitbox,
[4545.34s -> 4549.06s]  the second plank, all hell breaks loose.
[4549.06s -> 4557.57s]  Oh, so nerve-racking.
[4557.57s -> 4559.57s]  I'm like a fucking lightning bolt right now.
[4559.57s -> 4572.29s]  There's one of those girls.
[4572.29s -> 4574.29s]  What's that sound? What do they sound like?
[4574.29s -> 4577.36s]  Right there.
[4577.36s -> 4579.36s]  There it is!
[4579.36s -> 4583.78s]  There it is!
[4583.78s -> 4587.15s]  Yeah!
[4587.15s -> 4589.15s]  See, I told you I knew what the show was.
[4589.15s -> 4592.93s]  See, I told you I knew what the show was.
[4592.93s -> 4599.95s]  Grab high-placed objects.
[4599.95s -> 4608.40s]  Grab high-placed objects.
[4608.40s -> 4610.40s]  I'm going to walk around and pick them up.
[4610.40s -> 4613.92s]  Just throw some fucking apple grenades.
[4613.92s -> 4616.54s]  Hold on.
[4616.54s -> 4618.54s]  There's multiple red swirls here.
[4618.54s -> 4621.55s]  There's multiple red swirls here.
[4621.55s -> 4623.55s]  This is the real gear check here.
[4623.55s -> 4630.14s]  Find out if I can be capable.
[4630.14s -> 4632.14s]  Okay, high objects.
[4632.14s -> 4637.71s]  Okay, high objects.
[4637.71s -> 4647.25s]  Got it.
[4647.25s -> 4649.68s]  Drop the objects at...
[4649.68s -> 4651.68s]  gemmy neutrons.
[4651.68s -> 4654.24s]  Did it work? Yes.
[4654.24s -> 4666.05s]  Come on.
[4666.05s -> 4678.58s]  Got it. Two?
[4678.58s -> 4683.70s]  You can't drop them on the ground?
[4683.70s -> 4685.70s]  Why?
[4685.70s -> 4687.70s]  These red swirls!
[4687.70s -> 4689.70s]  I'm going to seriously piss me off.
[4689.70s -> 4691.70s]  I'm just going to kill the red swirls.
[4691.70s -> 4695.79s]  Just kill them first.
[4695.79s -> 4699.76s]  There's one more over here.
[4699.76s -> 4703.28s]  Now I'm not going to get attacked.
[4703.28s -> 4706.48s]  And after this, we'll move on to the next game.
[4706.48s -> 4708.48s]  And after this, we'll move on to the next game.
[4708.48s -> 4718.58s]  Thank you.
[4718.58s -> 4720.58s]  I would recommend you play...
[4720.58s -> 4723.78s]  That counts, right?
[4723.78s -> 4726.46s]  This one's actually fun.
[4726.46s -> 4728.46s]  I recommend that you play gemmy neutron.
[4728.46s -> 4730.46s]  This game's not good.
[4730.46s -> 4732.46s]  This game's not good.
[4732.46s -> 4734.64s]  Throws really infuriating little sequences at you for no reason like that.
[4734.64s -> 4736.64s]  Throws really infuriating little sequences at you for no reason like that.
[4736.64s -> 4738.64s]  That's unfair.
[4738.64s -> 4743.95s]  This game's not very good.
[4743.95s -> 4748.30s]  Oh, Matt, because Matt.
[4748.30s -> 4750.30s]  Matt, because Matt. Matt, because Matt.
[4750.30s -> 4754.27s]  Matt, give me that right now.
[4754.27s -> 4762.83s]  Matt, give me that right now.
[4762.83s -> 4764.83s]  I would love, in fact, like an e-sports event.
[4764.83s -> 4766.83s]  I would love, in fact, like an e-sports event.
[4766.83s -> 4769.20s]  Or at a stadium somewhere.
[4769.20s -> 4771.20s]  Don't you just wish you could hear that chant?
[4771.20s -> 4773.20s]  It would be so funny.
[4773.20s -> 4776.53s]  What a stupid chant that would be.
[4776.53s -> 4778.53s]  Oh, he missed a shot in lane!
[4778.53s -> 4780.53s]  That's too bad.
[4780.53s -> 4786.48s]  Where's fucking Ed?
[4786.48s -> 4788.48s]  Yeah, it looks like his...
[4788.48s -> 4790.48s]  Who's a Bleak Legends fucking character?
[4790.48s -> 4795.28s]  Where's Ed?
[4795.28s -> 4814.16s]  Where's Ed?
[4814.16s -> 4818.38s]  I fell through the earth.
[4818.38s -> 4821.97s]  He was under the map.
[4821.97s -> 4823.97s]  Okay, well, let's try to go on these one more time.
[4823.97s -> 4830.50s]  Okay, well, let's try to go on these one more time.
[4830.50s -> 4832.50s]  Like, imagine...
[4832.50s -> 4834.67s]  Well, let's go over that again.
[4834.67s -> 4836.67s]  So, there's like a big e-sports event.
[4836.67s -> 4839.36s]  And one of the teams, you know, a counter-strike or whatever.
[4839.36s -> 4841.36s]  And some guy misses a very important shot.
[4841.36s -> 4843.36s]  And you can see him visibly pissed off.
[4843.36s -> 4845.36s]  Commentators are like,
[4845.36s -> 4847.36s]  Man, he really is not happy about that.
[4847.36s -> 4849.36s]  Missing that last shot.
[4849.36s -> 4851.36s]  And the whole stadium is just like,
[4851.36s -> 4853.36s]  Mad because bad! Mad because bad!
[4853.36s -> 4858.16s]  Mad because bad!
[4858.16s -> 4863.73s]  I think that would be funny.
[4863.73s -> 4869.04s]  No, don't!
[4869.04s -> 4871.34s]  That would be so rude.
[4871.34s -> 4873.34s]  I know.
[4873.34s -> 4875.34s]  What's that again?
[4875.34s -> 4877.34s]  Hold on, say that again?
[4877.34s -> 4879.34s]  I'd like for you to say that in front of the whole class, please.
[4879.34s -> 4881.34s]  Interesting. That would be what?
[4881.34s -> 4884.03s]  What would that be?
[4884.03s -> 4886.03s]  Rude.
[4886.03s -> 4888.03s]  Very rude, wouldn't it?
[4888.03s -> 4890.53s]  Interesting.
[4890.53s -> 4906.34s]  You just fell right from my fucking trap.
[4906.34s -> 4908.34s]  All of a sudden, it's rude!
[4908.34s -> 4913.01s]  Whoa!
[4913.01s -> 4925.23s]  Alright, come on, come on.
[4925.23s -> 4931.87s]  I tried to catch it.
[4931.87s -> 4937.44s]  I can't take this anymore.
[4942.50s -> 4944.50s]  Can I just like strategically give commands to say like,
[4944.50s -> 4946.50s]  Hey, Ed, you stay over there and patrol.
[4946.50s -> 4949.31s]  Next, next.
[4949.31s -> 4951.31s]  Just wait, I gotta do this one more time.
[4951.31s -> 4962.45s]  Hello, how are you?
[4962.45s -> 4965.14s]  Hello, how are you?
[4965.14s -> 4970.45s]  Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[4970.45s -> 4977.41s]  Got it.
[4977.41s -> 4979.41s]  Look, Sarah left the table.
[4979.41s -> 4985.68s]  What am I supposed to do about that?
[4985.68s -> 4997.39s]  What would that do for us?
[4997.39s -> 5003.20s]  Push Sarah.
[5003.20s -> 5008.11s]  You sure?
[5008.11s -> 5010.11s]  I'm not sure that, I mean,
[5010.11s -> 5012.11s]  Push Sarah or Ehluhala Hey?
[5012.11s -> 5023.31s]  Which one do you think?
[5023.31s -> 5025.31s]  No, that was good. That was a good idea too.
[5025.31s -> 5027.31s]  Ehluhala Hey.
[5027.31s -> 5029.31s]  Thanks for the tip, guys.
[5035.65s -> 5038.78s]  Oh, jeez!
[5040.78s -> 5042.78s]  This game's driving me insane.
[5042.78s -> 5044.78s]  And chat insane.
[5044.78s -> 5046.78s]  Why is everybody driving insane?
[5046.78s -> 5051.26s]  You gonna go over the jump?
[5051.26s -> 5059.65s]  Insane.
[5059.65s -> 5066.11s]  There's a reason why I wouldn't be invited
[5066.11s -> 5068.11s]  to an eSports event as a caster or something.
[5068.11s -> 5070.11s]  I would stand up and try to get them to do the Ed laugh.
[5070.11s -> 5072.11s]  I'd be like,
[5072.11s -> 5074.11s]  Oh yeah, that's really interesting what's going on on screen.
[5074.11s -> 5076.11s]  That was a full penta kill, I guess.
[5076.11s -> 5078.11s]  But hey, can everybody in the audience do your best
[5078.11s -> 5080.11s]  Eddie laugh?
[5080.11s -> 5082.86s]  I would be removed.
[5082.86s -> 5097.46s]  What am I supposed to do?
[5097.46s -> 5100.02s]  Switch to Ed?
[5100.02s -> 5102.38s]  Can Ed do something about the door?
[5102.38s -> 5104.38s]  Everyone's gonna be fringed.
[5104.38s -> 5109.12s]  Yeah?
[5109.12s -> 5114.67s]  Is that what happened?
[5114.67s -> 5120.03s]  Is that what's over here?
[5120.03s -> 5125.07s]  Can I break that?
[5125.07s -> 5130.51s]  I think so.
[5130.51s -> 5132.88s]  No, it's over here.
[5135.44s -> 5137.44s]  Begging you, everybody's so
[5137.44s -> 5139.44s]  upset right now.
[5139.44s -> 5143.86s]  Jump over it.
[5143.86s -> 5149.81s]  Stand tall.
[5149.81s -> 5151.81s]  The springboard move.
[5153.81s -> 5155.81s]  No.
[5155.81s -> 5157.81s]  I have to move something over there?
[5157.81s -> 5161.97s]  The jump?
[5161.97s -> 5172.96s]  The jump?
[5172.96s -> 5174.96s]  Oh, wait.
[5178.35s -> 5180.59s]  Nice. Alright, now we have to go like this.
[5180.59s -> 5182.59s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[5182.59s -> 5184.59s]  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[5184.59s -> 5186.59s]  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[5186.59s -> 5188.59s]  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[5188.59s -> 5190.59s]  I'm almost had it. I was gonna do that
[5190.59s -> 5195.33s]  for like five minutes.
[5195.33s -> 5197.50s]  That's what I would do with like an eSports event,
[5197.50s -> 5199.50s]  and it would be like everyone would just cringe.
[5203.86s -> 5205.86s]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up.
[5205.86s -> 5214.05s]  What is
[5214.05s -> 5216.05s]  torture? I'll give you torture.
[5216.05s -> 5218.05s]  You want me to try to do no
[5218.05s -> 5220.22s]  for five straight minutes?
[5220.22s -> 5235.90s]  Of course we do.
[5235.90s -> 5237.90s]  No, you don't. You really don't want that.
[5237.90s -> 5254.57s]  look I want to leave this game but I can't this is back when licensed video
[5254.57s -> 5275.20s]  games existed and were fun so I have to do the planks still they don't they
[5275.20s -> 5280.62s]  don't make licensed video games anymore and if they do they're like accidental
[5280.62s -> 5288.36s]  games somebody just accidentally made the whole thing all right we're getting
[5288.36s -> 5296.85s]  there let me just get to the candy store and then I'll stop. Spider-man? yeah but
[5296.85s -> 5301.37s]  spi- hold on there's a difference look Batman Arkham the Arkham games are
[5301.37s -> 5306.47s]  amazing Spider-man is amazing but those I'm talking about like cartoons or TV
[5306.47s -> 5315.33s]  shows Batman isn't a solely a TV show Batman is an entire franchise of media
[5315.33s -> 5325.04s]  he's everything Ed and Eddie is just Ed and Eddie let's break this with Ed

[7927.81s -> 7931.13s]  there's a very real possibility this is just a game that we've already
[7931.13s -> 7945.32s]  played on P just on the console I don't think it is though this looks like a
[7945.32s -> 7958.54s]  different version I can't tell because there's no host on the back the last
[7958.54s -> 7973.30s]  one was Louie Anderson right now here we go

[13361.29s -> 13368.70s]  interest such as the sunken ship appears green squares on your sonar eat
[13368.70s -> 13372.66s]  the diver in the cage main objectives appear as a red circle on your sonar
[13372.66s -> 13400.62s]  that wasn't it I still got him we're gonna kill the diver you're in
[13400.62s -> 13411.57s]  trouble you're in trouble it's a little wonky but you know it's just

[13429.06s -> 13450.74s]  destroy that thing manually moving a camera is kind of annoying it's
[13450.74s -> 13470.05s]  inverted I'm not killing it I got it should be it right so what's the red
[13470.05s -> 13486.50s]  thing here I'm gonna eat something come here food let's go down maybe

[13520.88s -> 13537.33s]  sinking right I'm gonna destroy the underwater robot then oh I thought I
[13537.33s -> 13558.14s]  already did that apparently not I thought I crushed it already author
[13558.14s -> 13568.25s]  Peter Benchley was thrown off the set after objecting to the climax okay
[13568.25s -> 13584.58s]  cool little tidbit I was shown the objective in the cutscene what do I do
[13584.58s -> 13587.66s]  well you've sat there for like a two straight minutes trying to break the
[13587.66s -> 13593.94s]  thing and I thought I broke it swim by the beach to attack swimmers to turn
[13593.94s -> 13600.74s]  smart camera off press R3 to enter first person press R3 button once more
[13600.74s -> 13612.63s]  okay it's a first person so when a victim is on the surface tap R2 to
[13612.63s -> 13628.50s]  drag them under without being spotted my god this is horrible he's
[13628.50s -> 13651.81s]  like puking up blood look what I got all right now eat him that's fucking

[13787.34s -> 13799.66s]  all right well let's keep going boat right here and crush the boat I can't
[13799.66s -> 13815.66s]  any people on this boat no get the seals wait what's this license plate
[13815.70s -> 13838.04s]  I got a thousand points for that eat eat eat eat eat she faces you actually level
[13838.04s -> 13857.66s]  up in this game I just jump up there I kind of can feel like I already blew
[13857.66s -> 13877.03s]  this though maybe not invisible wall well I'm not certain what I need to do
[13877.03s -> 13898.18s]  maybe I have to just restart holy shit okay that's cool
[13898.22s -> 13910.93s]  restore checkpoint maybe what is the latest checkpoint this is not the
[13910.93s -> 13951.76s]  beginning of the game is it destroy the peers okay she's still live this is
[13951.76s -> 13957.49s]  definitely one of those games that had a set of mature rating
[13957.49s -> 13985.86s]  that guy on fire this is rated it's rated holy shit why'd you just come in
[13986.62s -> 14000.20s]  I actually don't really I don't like this game it's too much it's it's scary
[14000.20s -> 14023.21s]  the underwater screams sounds so horrible now now you fuck it's just
[14023.21s -> 14043.19s]  not nice I need a better camera that was a first person it's easier so now
[14043.19s -> 14070.62s]  what's left just destroy more of the pier fuck this restaurant apparently
[14070.62s -> 14106.40s]  yeah destroy the whole building wait this person dead I think so see this
[14106.40s -> 14114.10s]  glowing red objects something I need to do to destroy them specifically just
[14114.10s -> 14132.08s]  take on the supports there it goes destroy the inflatable rafts
[14132.08s -> 14140.14s]  walking towards the shark is probably not the best idea
[14140.18s -> 14149.10s]  I hate to tell you this but I'm trying to get away this is very sad
[14149.10s -> 14193.62s]  this fucking assault rifle this camera is gonna make a few more other
[14193.62s -> 14211.30s]  raft right here right
[14211.30s -> 14229.29s]  keep an eye out there it is do I get to do this I just crosscheck that guy what
[14229.29s -> 14255.17s]  a snipe this bad ending now you can upgrade your abilities okay accuracy
[14255.17s -> 14261.53s]  jaws ability to successfully hit a target near afar power is jaws ability
[14261.53s -> 14274.04s]  inflict damage speed hunger I'm gonna probably say power I would do power
[14274.04s -> 14287.50s]  first I thought I just tried to I mean sure I tried to press right or left
[14287.50s -> 14308.00s]  what you just lock yourself I don't think so the breakout where are they
[14308.00s -> 14311.56s]  bringing me I just killed like 15 people you're gonna tie me up and
[14311.56s -> 14348.05s]  bring me to an attraction how would you ever bring jaws here see down it
[14348.05s -> 14350.93s]  this is where they make the shark's own great white shark on display for the
[14350.93s -> 14355.33s]  tourists this is going to cause crowds in record numbers mayor our research
[14355.33s -> 14358.73s]  tank can hold the shark but we are not prepared to display him in the show

[25347.50s -> 25353.43s]  what always loved germa's gameplay commentaries on youtube
[25353.43s -> 25357.35s]  and now that he's streaming live on twitch more on that later
[25357.35s -> 25361.86s]  you can't get enough of him so you of course joined his discord
[25361.86s -> 25365.46s]  navigating through the channels you may go straight to the reason you
[25365.46s -> 25368.74s]  joined recommendations where you can suggest that germa
[25368.74s -> 25372.74s]  play your favorite game or do something in person for a stream however
[25372.74s -> 25377.38s]  it's more likely that you'll be enticed by the channel referred to as general
[25377.38s -> 25381.54s]  you click on it and are greeted with an ongoing discussion about why or why
[25381.54s -> 25385.70s]  not we bows people who watch anime essentially are
[25385.70s -> 25390.54s]  degenerates one and in an instant they're talking about snow
[25390.54s -> 25394.46s]  although you may not agree with some or perhaps even most of the users
[25394.46s -> 25398.06s]  there is one thing that everyone in that community has in common
[25398.14s -> 25401.18s]  as community moderator noah effectator states
[25401.18s -> 25406.14s]  that's the thing germa's discourse community is populated not necessarily
[25406.14s -> 25409.98s]  by like-minded individuals but by people who all have one thing
[25409.98s -> 25412.78s]  in common they have a desire to watch this one
[25412.78s -> 25416.62s]  man entertain thousands of people by doing whatever he feels like doing
[25416.62s -> 25420.97s]  don't look at my armpit hair two one discord user laser two noah
[25420.97s -> 25424.57s]  interviewed by joey provost wait what what is this
[25424.57s -> 25427.29s]  why are we getting thousand and nineteen three noah
[25427.29s -> 25431.69s]  interviewed by joey provost on discord oh this is uh god damn it this is like
[25431.69s -> 25435.29s]  thousand and nineteen by now it's important to recognize what a
[25435.29s -> 25439.62s]  moderator does exactly a moderator makes sure that the people
[25439.62s -> 25444.42s]  springtime i'm gonna get cleaned up all right i clean it up in the spring
[25444.42s -> 25448.42s]  so stop it follow moderators can mute people
[25448.42s -> 25453.13s]  ban them and do several other things three so it goes without saying that
[25453.13s -> 25458.58s]  an expert of the community which linguist john swales attests to
[25458.58s -> 25462.90s]  being vital to a discourse community that it has changing memberships for
[25462.90s -> 25466.74s]  would definitely be a moderator as moderator grump clump of three
[25466.74s -> 25469.86s]  years confirms moderators are chosen if they are
[25469.86s -> 25473.62s]  rational and highly involved members of the community that prove themselves to
[25473.62s -> 25477.70s]  be upstanding people that can enforce rules and keep a level head five this
[25477.70s -> 25480.98s]  expertise is proven to be beneficial to the community
[25480.98s -> 25486.18s]  as on germa's twitch.tv twitch is a platform where people can
[25486.18s -> 25489.94s]  stream themselves playing video games card games
[25489.94s -> 25495.62s]  skits drawing whatever you can imagine and includes with that stream the
[25495.62s -> 25499.22s]  live chat in which any user can say something to the streamer or other
[25499.22s -> 25503.30s]  users in the chat channel what is known as live chat goes
[25503.30s -> 25507.14s]  by incredibly fast and it can be incomprehensibly difficult
[25507.14s -> 25511.00s]  to moderate chat when the messages scroll by so quickly
[25511.00s -> 25515.56s]  what helps this is discord which the discourse community utilizes alongside
[25515.56s -> 25521.18s]  twitch force wales john the concept of discourse community
[25521.18s -> 25525.91s]  genre analysis english in academic and research settings
[25525.91s -> 25532.15s]  boston cambridge up 1995 grump clump interviewed by joey provost on
[25532.15s -> 25536.63s]  discord on february 15 2019 what is
[25536.63s -> 25540.55s]  discord anyway discord is an application that
[25540.55s -> 25544.71s]  people can use in order to communicate whether that be through images what is
[25544.71s -> 25549.35s]  discord anyways or text chat germa's discord community is one
[25549.35s -> 25552.63s]  that boasts 16 600 and that's a mess of shit
[25552.63s -> 25555.83s]  there's a lot of people you may think that it is a disaster to communicate
[25555.83s -> 25559.83s]  in a server that large only 30 to 50 people will be talking at
[25559.83s -> 25563.51s]  the same time even less in the same channel
[25563.51s -> 25568.17s]  so why even bother with the discord when twitch has its own chat already
[25568.17s -> 25572.33s]  noah a moderator of both germa's discord and twitch channel for about a
[25572.33s -> 25575.61s]  year and a half found true that's an accident him on the
[25575.61s -> 25578.97s]  discord that's not true interviewees answers
[25578.97s -> 25582.65s]  this question twitch is all live the chat goes by
[25582.65s -> 25586.65s]  extremely fast due to the fast nature of live streams
[25586.65s -> 25590.57s]  and the fact that thousands of people are watching at any given point
[25590.57s -> 25595.03s]  mob mentality can come through sometimes
[25595.03s -> 25599.83s]  in comparison to the discord which is basically just a slower chat room
[25599.83s -> 25603.51s]  six so it seems that the discord is there for a more reliable method of
[25603.51s -> 25607.75s]  communication than live chat which disappears after a set time
[25607.75s -> 25612.39s]  grump clump clarifies this observation i don't really consider this community
[25612.39s -> 25615.51s]  to have a set goal other than to have a place to enjoy
[25615.51s -> 25619.99s]  yourself seven so then the discord is used in different ways by everybody
[25619.99s -> 25623.67s]  and nobody really seems to have a concise answer to the question of what
[25623.67s -> 25628.07s]  the purpose of the community is but as swale states the goal nobody
[25628.07s -> 25635.59s]  knows may not be explicitly stated note that other terminology nine grump
[25635.59s -> 25639.51s]  clump interviewed by joey six noah interviewed
[25639.51s -> 25642.47s]  by joey what's going on here wait why is it doing this can come
[25642.47s -> 25645.75s]  through sometimes in comparison to the discord which is
[25645.75s -> 25650.55s]  basically just a slower chat room six so it seems that the discord is
[25650.55s -> 25653.99s]  there for a more reliable method of communication than live chat which
[25653.99s -> 25658.15s]  disappears after a set time grump clump clarifies this
[25658.23s -> 25662.71s]  observation i don't really consider this community to have a set goal
[25662.71s -> 25666.47s]  other than to have a place to enjoy yourself seven so then the discord is
[25666.47s -> 25670.55s]  used in different ways by everybody and nobody really seems to have a
[25670.55s -> 25674.47s]  concise answer to the question of what the purpose of the community is
[25674.47s -> 25679.51s]  but as swale states the goals of a discourse may not be explicitly stated
[25679.51s -> 25682.95s]  however it still is a discourse community if it adheres to the other
[25682.95s -> 25686.01s]  five characteristics eight but again the
[25686.01s -> 25689.61s]  common factor in all of this is the adoration of germa which unites the
[25689.61s -> 25694.25s]  discourse community six noah interviewed by joey provost
[25694.25s -> 25701.62s]  on discord on february 15 2000 mentality nine why mentality
[25701.62s -> 25707.70s]  12 grump clump the discord members of the community also create genre by
[25707.70s -> 25712.50s]  participating in the live chat and also by influencing germa as he
[25712.50s -> 25717.62s]  frequently will read the chat the live chat grump clump says is
[25717.62s -> 25721.88s]  the majority of the community they are the loudest and have the strongest
[25721.88s -> 25725.82s]  herd mentality nine further because of the common
[25725.82s -> 25730.22s]  trait that they all like watching germa chat also seems to focus a lot on
[25730.22s -> 25733.82s]  trying to send a message to germa in the form of chat in order for germa
[25733.82s -> 25736.70s]  to read it which appears to be easily overwhelming
[25736.70s -> 25740.22s]  for the moderators to be able to moderate that flow of text
[25740.22s -> 25744.22s]  however new member of three months dr hunkalicious
[25744.22s -> 25748.22s]  criticrat equals three tells us how germa doesn't use the discord often
[25748.22s -> 25752.38s]  enough and rarely posts on twitter chat is where a lot of content comes
[25752.38s -> 25756.15s]  from germa also chat has a powerful influence on the
[25756.15s -> 25759.67s]  community and it's where a lot of terms and culture of the community is
[25759.67s -> 25762.66s]  formed and so it seems then that both the
[25762.66s -> 25765.54s]  discord and twitch chat are essential to the community
[25765.54s -> 25768.74s]  the pretty gap also appears that in this community
[25768.74s -> 25772.34s]  the characteristics of intercommunication participation
[25772.34s -> 25775.94s]  and genre which are vital to a discourse community 11 are all
[25776.02s -> 25779.38s]  interconnected as participation cause genre
[25779.38s -> 25783.30s]  genre causes participation as well as intercommunication
[25783.30s -> 25786.90s]  and intercommunication causes participation
[25786.90s -> 25790.58s]  the method and the way in which go about communicating is unique
[25790.58s -> 25794.82s]  to say the least nine grump clump interviewed by joey
[25794.82s -> 25798.26s]  nine grump grump interviewer interviewer i wouldn't know where to stop
[25798.26s -> 25803.51s]  12 i can however list two of the most essential note that other terminology

[25807.43s -> 25810.71s]  12 grump clump interviewed by joey no no no what about this part
[25810.71s -> 25814.92s]  you skipped this part because i wouldn't know where to stop 12 i can however

[25870.46s -> 25874.50s]  you know the community terms and then it ends with
[25874.50s -> 25886.33s]  that's how it ends dr hunkalicious equals three critty crap
[25886.33s -> 25893.50s]  i zoned all of that out i didn't pay attention to a word of that
