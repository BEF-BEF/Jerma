[0.31s -> 15.61s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Counter-Strike Global Offensive Gameplay Commentary.
[15.61s -> 21.61s]  And before I get into this video at all, I gotta thank special thanks somebody for this Beta Key.
[21.61s -> 27.13s]  Because this game, if you don't know, is very, very hard to get a Beta Key for.
[27.13s -> 33.35s]  You are more likely to be struck by lightning than to get a Counter-Strike Go Beta Key.
[33.43s -> 37.91s]  So thank you so, so much to the person that gave this to me.
[37.91s -> 41.35s]  Because I didn't get this on my own, somebody gave me this.
[41.35s -> 44.39s]  And they don't want their name in the video, and I can totally understand that.
[44.39s -> 51.88s]  But Anonymous, thank you so, so much dude. You don't know how long I've been looking for one of these damn keys.
[51.88s -> 56.60s]  And a follow-up to this, if you want to get into the Beta and you don't know how,
[56.60s -> 59.32s]  there is really only one way you can do it.
[59.32s -> 63.56s]  You have to go to the Counter-Strike website, or I think you can do it through Steam as well.
[63.56s -> 67.40s]  You have to do their survey. There's a Counter-Strike survey you can take.
[67.40s -> 70.36s]  You fill it out and you get put on the list, I guess.
[70.36s -> 73.50s]  I did it a long time ago and I still haven't been called.
[73.50s -> 77.40s]  But I'm pretty certain that's the only way you can do it.
[77.40s -> 80.76s]  So now, what do I think of this game? Do I think this is a fun game?
[80.76s -> 84.36s]  I've played it for a couple hours now. I've got maybe three or four hours into it.
[84.36s -> 87.48s]  And this game is great. It is a lot of fun guys.
[87.48s -> 91.32s]  I can't wait till this actually comes out. Because the best part about Counter-Strike,
[91.32s -> 96.12s]  to me at least, in my opinion, is not the default game modes.
[96.12s -> 100.84s]  When this game finally releases and the modders and the map makers get their hands on it,
[100.84s -> 103.96s]  that's when I have the most fun in Counter-Strike.
[103.96s -> 108.44s]  I'll give you two very good specific examples. One of them is Jailbreak.
[108.44s -> 112.68s]  If you've never played Jailbreak before, it is hysterical.
[112.68s -> 116.28s]  It is one of the funnest mods I've ever played in any game.
[116.28s -> 123.85s]  And I probably dumped in, god, probably a hundred plus hours into CS Source's Jailbreak.
[123.85s -> 128.01s]  And when they finally get their hands on it and they make CS GO Jailbreak,
[128.01s -> 130.73s]  you better believe I'm going to be playing that a ton.
[130.73s -> 133.70s]  I actually might do videos on that, to be honest.
[133.70s -> 136.66s]  There could be some really funny content coming out of Jailbreak.
[136.66s -> 140.58s]  Very briefly, I'll tell you what it is. I didn't even tell you what the hell the mode was.
[140.58s -> 144.90s]  Jailbreak is there's two sides. There's the prisoners and then the prison guards.
[144.98s -> 148.66s]  And the whole goal is you're supposed to follow the rules as the prisoners.
[148.66s -> 150.50s]  They open up the gates and they go,
[150.50s -> 152.50s]  Prisoners come out, everyone listen to me.
[152.50s -> 156.90s]  And I want you all to walk ten paces to your left.
[156.90s -> 159.78s]  And Simon says jump.
[159.78s -> 162.02s]  And if you didn't jump, they would just shoot you.
[162.02s -> 163.30s]  So it's stuff like that.
[163.30s -> 167.78s]  And if you were a prisoner, every time I was a prisoner, I would never follow the rules.
[167.78s -> 170.26s]  I would always like just, oh, Simon says jump.
[170.26s -> 172.34s]  And then I would just run at him and just start stabbing him.
[172.34s -> 174.42s]  And sometimes it would work and you could pick up their gun
[174.42s -> 175.54s]  because you don't start with a gun.
[176.58s -> 179.14s]  It's just crazy. Maybe I'll do a video. I don't even know.
[179.14s -> 180.89s]  We'll see in the future.
[180.89s -> 183.93s]  But other than Jailbreak, really, probably Ice World.
[183.93s -> 185.61s]  I know there's going to be a new Ice World.
[185.61s -> 188.89s]  There's always an Ice World in every Counter-Strike.
[188.89s -> 192.17s]  So Ice World, probably Snow World, but there was a Snow World, wasn't there?
[192.17s -> 197.05s]  Just that tiny close quarter death match where all the guns are on the ground.
[197.05s -> 199.85s]  And then you could only buy things if you were standing in the middle.
[199.85s -> 203.37s]  But it was almost impossible to stand in the middle because the map was so tiny
[203.37s -> 206.30s]  and bullets are just flying everywhere.
[206.30s -> 207.86s]  I can't wait.
[207.86s -> 211.70s]  But anyways, let's start talking about what's actually happening on the screen
[211.70s -> 213.86s]  and what I think of this game for real.
[213.86s -> 218.50s]  The actual game, not the mods or the potential maps they're going to make for it.
[218.50s -> 221.50s]  This game is pretty fast paced.
[221.50s -> 227.27s]  Most games in Counter-Strike will last less than one or two minutes for the whole round.
[227.27s -> 231.99s]  And that's great because if you don't know, when you die in this game, you don't come back.
[231.99s -> 237.85s]  It's just like Arena Mode in Team Fortress 2 or the Search and Destroy in Call of Duty.
[237.85s -> 241.38s]  Same exact premise, when you die, you're permanently dead.
[241.38s -> 246.58s]  And it is so refreshing knowing that these rounds are not going to last more than two minutes.
[246.58s -> 248.98s]  I have OCD, I got ADHD, guys.
[248.98s -> 254.50s]  I am one of those people that cannot stand no action for more than 10 seconds.
[254.50s -> 257.22s]  If I die in Counter-Strike at the beginning of a round,
[257.22s -> 263.06s]  I am so tempted to just hit escape and go to quit game, exit game, and go find another lobby
[263.06s -> 265.30s]  because it's like pulling teeth for me.
[265.30s -> 268.50s]  Sitting there for more than a couple minutes is pretty much the equivalent
[268.50s -> 271.30s]  of me punching myself in my own face 10 times.
[271.30s -> 275.64s]  I don't know if it's like that for anybody else, but it's like that for me.
[275.64s -> 279.80s]  And really besides that, the only real complaint I have about this game
[279.80s -> 283.56s]  has nothing to do with the guns, has nothing to do with the gun mechanics.
[283.56s -> 285.08s]  Because, I mean, they're all pretty balanced.
[285.08s -> 287.32s]  The recoil is pretty easy to get used to.
[287.32s -> 289.80s]  The reload times can be kind of slow on some of the weapons,
[289.80s -> 292.84s]  and the AK-47 is a little odd with its recoil.
[292.84s -> 294.84s]  But for the most part, it's a pretty balanced game.
[294.84s -> 300.76s]  The problem that I have is, shooting somebody in the chest or in any of their body parts,
[300.76s -> 303.56s]  it takes a lot of bullets to kill them.
[303.56s -> 308.76s]  And especially when you can get that one lucky headshot on somebody and kill them instantly.
[308.76s -> 312.20s]  And I know that it has a lot to do with Kevlar in this game.
[312.20s -> 316.04s]  But really, when I come around a corner, I've jumped around corners before spraying,
[316.04s -> 321.00s]  and I've unloaded almost a whole clip on somebody's chest.
[321.00s -> 322.68s]  And then I just get insta-headshotted.
[322.68s -> 326.30s]  And it's really discouraging, and I know I have to just practice on my aiming,
[326.30s -> 328.06s]  get those headshots down.
[328.06s -> 331.34s]  But it can get discouraging, especially when you get the jump on somebody.
[331.34s -> 333.50s]  That's my only real complaint I have.
[333.50s -> 337.85s]  So that is going to wrap up this particular video on CSGO.
[337.85s -> 342.01s]  I'll leave you with a pretty gruesome headshot I got on somebody.
[342.01s -> 346.25s]  So hopefully you enjoy that, and I will see you guys all next time.
[346.25s -> 349.05s]  So take care, everybody.
