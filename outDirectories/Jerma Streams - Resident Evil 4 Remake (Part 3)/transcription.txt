[21.94s -> 36.39s]  All right. Hello. Sorry about that. Sorry about that. I was in pre-stream chat talking for a
[36.39s -> 46.28s]  little too long. I didn't manage my time well and I'm technically 50 minutes late. Although,
[46.28s -> 55.03s]  I did update it and technically I'm 20 minutes late. It's all right. It was good talks. It was
[55.03s -> 66.01s]  a good talk. It was good talk. It was. Yeah. Hello. Welcome back. If you were here yesterday,
[66.01s -> 70.25s]  we're going to do the same thing we did yesterday. Going to keep going through Resident Evil 4.
[71.77s -> 79.90s]  I think I'm about halfway through the game. Seems like I'm about,
[80.94s -> 92.04s]  there's probably another 12 hours left. So after tonight's stream, if I stream for,
[92.68s -> 100.50s]  you know, five to seven hours tonight, there'll probably be maybe one more at some point midweek
[100.50s -> 112.66s]  next week. After I finish Resident Evil 4 remake, we're going to go back into Breath of the Wild.
[115.46s -> 121.94s]  I'm not going to promise that I'm going to complete Breath of the Wild in this time period next week,
[122.50s -> 128.90s]  but I'm going to continue progressing through it. Maybe one or two streams of Breath of the Wild
[131.66s -> 135.10s]  and we'll see. I don't want to rush through Breath of the Wild. I don't want to sprint as fast as I
[135.10s -> 140.71s]  can through it. I saw some concerns saying, hey dude, you're going to sprint as fast as you can
[140.71s -> 147.08s]  through that because you want to just be done with it, don't you? And I typed yes, but then I
[147.08s -> 151.48s]  deleted it and said, no, that's not going to happen. So I'm not, I don't want to do that.
[156.04s -> 158.84s]  No, I'm kidding. I'm going to take my time through it. Like I already have.
[160.82s -> 174.52s]  When does a new one come out? May? May, May 12th. I got plenty of time, but I'm not going to play.
[174.52s -> 180.63s]  I don't think I'm going to play the new Zelda game the day it launches. There's plenty of time
[180.63s -> 186.38s]  to play the new one. I don't know. Maybe I don't. Do I? We'll see. Breath of the Wild came out in
[186.38s -> 193.45s]  2016. It took me like seven years to play it. So I don't know. Well, I don't know. We'll see.
[195.93s -> 202.17s]  I'm already setting him up for disappointment. I'm already setting you guys up for disappointment.
[202.17s -> 207.13s]  Well, you know what? It took me six years to play the other one. Like what? Why wouldn't it take me
[207.85s -> 214.50s]  years to play the new one? There's a lot of sadges in chat, I think, after that one.
[215.22s -> 230.74s]  2017. Yeah. What about Hilux 2? Oh yeah. I don't care, bro. Actually, that's like kind of cool.
[232.62s -> 237.80s]  Yeah, that's like, that doesn't bother me. To me, you just said, hey, man, I don't even care.
[237.80s -> 245.27s]  Do whatever you want. All right, thanks. The one guy of the year. That's one guy of the year for me.
[250.23s -> 262.84s]  I care. I care. It's all right to care. Hey, I care too. Yeah, I'm already really late. So I
[262.84s -> 272.10s]  don't we're gonna we're just gonna go. What was the last thing I did? I'm already late. I stall for
[272.10s -> 288.09s]  20, 30 minutes every stream anyways. So let's go. I was in the castle. There he is. Yes, face cam.
[288.09s -> 294.30s]  Face cam. Yeah, I turn it on. This is the time to turn it on. I told you guys the 2023 philosophy.
[294.30s -> 300.33s]  I feel like turning it on. I'm going to turn it on. I feel like I felt like turning it on
[300.33s -> 314.78s]  the last couple of weeks. Going off real goddamn soon. All right, let me take a sip. Oh, okay.
[316.17s -> 323.03s]  So what was the last thing we did? Head for the ball. All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just did the
[323.98s -> 333.46s]  shooting gallery shooting game thing. What is in here? Oh, it's none of these like square key
[333.46s -> 354.55s]  things. There's three of those. Thank you. Want a tip? If you want to do a good laugh,
[355.11s -> 359.32s]  a good kind of laugh like I just did. A lot of people think, oh, breathe in.
[361.14s -> 365.03s]  No, no, no, you do it. That's not correct. Get a little bit of air out first.
[369.14s -> 374.18s]  Because then it's literally just like your diaphragm doing the work. Don't go too hard,
[374.18s -> 391.99s]  though. Be careful. He's doing theater lessons. Yeah, theater lessons. Dude, your breath smells.
[391.99s -> 393.99s]  Yeah, so here's the difference, right? Listen to the difference.
[400.71s -> 419.59s]  Which one sounded better? The second one. Yeah, it's all about, you know, breathing control and
[419.59s -> 430.33s]  diaphragm control. Now that that does not mean go and like choke. It's all about just breathing and
[430.33s -> 442.10s]  diaphragm. I'm not expelling that much air when I do that. What is he talking about? I don't know.
[442.10s -> 451.06s]  Who got us on this? All right, we're going to go this way. Cool. Sweet. Turn it up for me. How's
[451.06s -> 465.83s]  the volume? Is it kind of low? Turn it up a little bit. You did. Sorry. All right. There's the head.
[466.63s -> 483.14s]  Oh, it's one of those people. Oh, yeah. You almost started a new sandwich. I'm in a
[483.14s -> 511.21s]  fucked up mood tonight. I'm sorry. It's already starting. Where is he? Oh, you piece of shit.
[511.21s -> 544.30s]  Whatever. I know where he is. No, stop backseat gaming, Ashley. Come on. Stop backseat. She's
[544.30s -> 578.14s]  backseating. Quick die. What is this head made out of? Fucking metal. What is? Oh, my God. This is
[578.14s -> 584.38s]  a bad start. This is off to a really fucking bad start. This is a bad start. Did he suplex me?
[588.47s -> 599.42s]  All right. That was a bad start. That was a bad start. It's a bad start. I was a bad start.
[599.42s -> 603.50s]  My arrows are bouncing off of his head. They were just bouncing off of his face.
[611.00s -> 617.61s]  All right. This time I'm not going to let him do that. We're not gaming tonight.
[617.61s -> 629.58s]  Nowhere. I gotta just get back in the swing of it. I'm taking this guy out immediately.
[643.26s -> 655.24s]  Eat this. No. Blow it up. How do I blow it up? How do I blow the mine up? Why doesn't
[656.28s -> 660.04s]  take the food out of the microwave? How do I do that? How do I blow it up?
[660.68s -> 673.38s]  How do you blow up the mine? How do I blow the mine up? It's a proximity mine. Oh,
[678.33s -> 687.22s]  it's a proximity mine. So what if I attach it to his body? Does that count as movement?
[695.53s -> 711.91s]  Yes. So I just have to aim better. Okay. Here we go. He's still alive. Oh, my God.
[711.91s -> 739.03s]  Get up. I thought she said she was okay. She just dropped. Stop. Why is this so stressful?
[749.14s -> 782.25s]  What? No. Are you dead? She keeps getting fucking suplexed. He's finally dead. Ow.
[782.89s -> 810.23s]  Must have slipped. That was so horrible. You hurt? I'm good. Thanks. You know that move
[810.23s -> 815.91s]  that they do in wrestling where they take your body flat and you're lying kind of down,
[815.91s -> 820.07s]  facing down and they press you up and they hold you there and it's like,
[822.23s -> 830.31s]  then they let you go. That happened to her like five times. They just like push you up and then
[830.31s -> 839.78s]  let you go after a while and you're just like pancake onto the mat. Yeah. It's called the
[839.78s -> 850.41s]  griddle press. Yeah. Wasn't that the ultimate warrior's finishing move? The ultimate warrior
[850.41s -> 856.06s]  would sprint. Oh, the ultimate warrior was ridiculous. The ultimate warrior, if you don't
[856.06s -> 865.94s]  know what his shtick was, he had like this superhero symbol was painted on him, whatever
[865.94s -> 873.34s]  it was. I don't know. I don't remember. He was in a speedo and his entrance music, he would sprint
[873.34s -> 882.01s]  as fast as he could into the ring. He never spent, I don't think it was ever more than three seconds
[882.01s -> 886.02s]  they took him to get to the ring. He would just sprint out there running as fast as he can and
[886.02s -> 894.50s]  then he would just be going like for 20 minutes in the beginning of the fight and he would grab
[894.50s -> 900.18s]  the ropes. He would grab the top ropes. You know, those three ropes. He would grab the top one and
[900.18s -> 908.07s]  fucking shake it like this like four or five times during the match. It was fucking crazy.
[914.07s -> 918.07s]  And that was that was his finishing move. He would press you in the air while doing the
[920.06s -> 923.98s]  and they would fucking let you go. That was enough to like kill you apparently, whatever it was.
[928.17s -> 940.66s]  Oh, old wrestling was just so out of control. This dude loves violence.
[940.74s -> 972.06s]  He loves murder. Wrestling is, I mean, those guys, they put their bodies through hell. But to me,
[972.06s -> 980.01s]  I always loved wrestling because it was sort of like a series of real-life Looney Tunes gags.
[980.81s -> 985.80s]  Just kind of chained up together. There's a lot of athleticism that goes into being a wrestler.
[988.07s -> 993.34s]  I just loved the, it was like a cartoon. It was like a living cartoon with real superheroes.
[994.30s -> 1012.54s]  It was great. All right. Is there anything else here? Well, 20 more of those are in here. All
[1012.54s -> 1039.37s]  right. There's only two more. Did I miss any other items? Maybe. Did I already go up there?
[1039.37s -> 1045.94s]  This bullets I didn't get. Where is that? I think it's on the actual thing over here.
[1045.94s -> 1064.44s]  Yeah. Are you frozen? It shouldn't be. If I'm frozen on your screen, then I might need to refresh.
[1065.24s -> 1087.46s]  All right. There's that one. What? It bounced off this guy. But this guy, honestly, it's the tank.
[1088.42s -> 1093.29s]  You know what? Yeah. You specked into tanking. You already have a tank behind you. You ruined
[1093.29s -> 1110.17s]  the party. And look what happened. The overzealous DPS ran in, took one hit, fucked everything up.
[1110.17s -> 1116.28s]  The tank went in front of the tank. Then the tank dies because there's no DPS. It's just,
[1116.28s -> 1119.80s]  just absolutely. They're probably swearing at each other in a discord call right now.
[1119.80s -> 1144.31s]  We're talking real friend ending shit right there. Uh, let's go here. I got everything in it. I'm
[1144.31s -> 1152.58s]  going to go save it though. You could cosplay as Leon and pull it off. Uh, I would need to wear,
[1152.58s -> 1160.18s]  uh, tall shoes, I think. Isn't Leon like six, two or something? It feels like six, three.
[1173.00s -> 1178.06s]  Welcome. Where would it, what can I do you for a lot of money?
[1179.02s -> 1185.50s]  Ruby's all rubbish. She makes no difference. The price. Well, that's our choice to make.
[1186.06s -> 1193.74s]  He's five 11. He's five 10. Really? Next time then. Oh, maybe he is. That's all right.
[1193.74s -> 1197.02s]  I don't know. Like there's only like three inches that I need. I could do that.
[1211.19s -> 1225.24s]  All right. Let's go. I can't go that way down this way. Probably be five 11. Well, I'm five
[1225.32s -> 1250.55s]  seven, five eight with shoes. I love wearing dress shoes, dressing up for an event because those
[1250.55s -> 1256.84s]  things give you at least, at least like 0.8 inches, like at least one full inch. That's great. I walk
[1256.84s -> 1263.34s]  around like I'm fucking boss. I mean, I'm saying I wear dress shoes and I got that extra inch,
[1263.34s -> 1266.94s]  extra inch and a half. I walk around like I'll fucking own the place. You know what I'm saying?
[1277.66s -> 1293.03s]  Oh, a lot. Do I have enough to finish this right now? It's three square, three. I could put it all
[1293.03s -> 1305.99s]  in here and probably make a hundred grand. Should I do that? All right. What's better filling this
[1305.99s -> 1320.68s]  with only reds or taking those over here and finishing it? It's just filling the crown up
[1320.68s -> 1329.59s]  and selling it. We're better than just putting all reds in here in red, all red, all red. If you have
[1329.59s -> 1337.34s]  all different colors, it's a hundred K. I don't know if I'll be able. Oh, wait a minute. I can do
[1337.34s -> 1348.06s]  that. I'm going back. Hold on. I can do that. I have enough to do that. Come on. I think I have
[1348.06s -> 1358.34s]  enough. I don't know. Yeah, I do. I have green, purple and red and then I have red and wait,
[1358.34s -> 1376.74s]  can I not do it? I need a blue gem. I wonder if he sells one. What does he sell? Okay. So we got
[1378.26s -> 1398.01s]  green, purple, red. Oh, then red. Wait, I can red yellow. So if I had a blue instead of this
[1398.01s -> 1409.02s]  red one, it would be worth a hundred thousand. What does he sell? All right. I'm going to hold
[1409.02s -> 1418.71s]  onto it then because that I don't think I've ever done that before. I need a blue gem. That's a
[1418.79s -> 1426.36s]  guaranteed hundred K if I can find a blue. Pretty sick. Pretty cool. Come on. No problem.
[1426.36s -> 1443.22s]  It's an achievement as well. Oh, cool. We're here. Talk about a fox in space again. Yeah.
[1444.42s -> 1452.41s]  I had the privilege of cameoing in the second episode of Fox in Space. Can we get a link to
[1452.41s -> 1458.41s]  it? Give one of the mods, put it in the chat. It was really, really cool. I don't want to spoil
[1458.41s -> 1468.46s]  anything, but it's very quick. It's like 10 seconds, I think. So if you see it, you'll see
[1468.46s -> 1486.17s]  it. It's really, really cool to be any part of that at all. So there it is. Do more voice acting.
[1488.90s -> 1499.06s]  Yeah. I, over the years, so I had a lot of passion to like do like voices and stuff and make sound
[1499.06s -> 1506.09s]  effects. So you guys know that it's like 70% of every live stream. But I think my, my happiness
[1506.09s -> 1511.85s]  and my passions lie in kind of doing it here. Like I just have fun doing it in front of you guys,
[1512.49s -> 1517.21s]  rather than other characters or something. I think just fun to do it. I know three voice Andy,
[1517.21s -> 1522.97s]  three of four voices Andy. I know, but it's still fun to do it here. I have like more fun doing it
[1522.97s -> 1528.26s]  kind of here rather than like in a studio booth or, you know, under a recording session or I
[1528.26s -> 1550.18s]  actually have more fun doing it. Just walking around. I don't want to miss anything. Somebody
[1550.18s -> 1554.26s]  asked like how did I might be making this up and somebody to say like, how did you learn that you
[1554.26s -> 1559.91s]  could do that? Or how did you like want, how did you know you wanted to or something? Um, I've
[1559.91s -> 1565.19s]  always just been an incredible, incredibly high energy person. Even when I'm sitting around and
[1565.19s -> 1574.18s]  that's ADHD, right? That's part of it. But it was always, I just like had, I just had to expel
[1574.18s -> 1580.55s]  fucking energy. And that was kind of the way it did it. And that sort of led into my adult life,
[1580.55s -> 1588.25s]  which is kind of weird, but I just, I always just had a lot of energy and it was actually kind of
[1588.25s -> 1603.58s]  a problem when I was younger. It got me. Hold on. Oh, they're climbing. They're climbing. What just
[1603.58s -> 1618.71s]  happened? Put me out. Put me out. Do something. Put me out. Oh shit. Well, Ashley, what are you
[1619.51s -> 1666.46s]  like a grenade? No, no, this is auto-saved. Wait, I knew I heard it. Take that damn mask off of
[1666.46s -> 1679.74s]  Ashley. I, it's a unlockable. It's only been off for like two minutes. Why don't I
[1679.74s -> 1708.49s]  open this? Hey, stop that. All right. Come over here. Are you all right? Thanks. I got to go kill
[1709.37s -> 1716.04s]  the guy that makes all the blog. That's called come out of your head. I guess got to die now,
[1716.04s -> 1732.12s]  like immediately I'm sprinting right to that guy spread out and you know what? Stay back. Don't
[1732.12s -> 1803.42s]  even come over here. Where is the mage or whatever it is? Where's the mage? With me.
[1805.62s -> 1811.94s]  Where's the mage? Oh, oh, you're dead. All right. Cool. I guess I accidentally killed that person
[1812.50s -> 1822.76s]  with a grenade. Finish the story. What was, what was I saying? Give me like one keyword and I'll
[1822.76s -> 1835.13s]  help figure it out. What was it? High energy as a kid. Oh, I mean, enemy, that kind of stuff gets
[1835.13s -> 1842.06s]  into trouble, right? Like trying to not be, not being able to be quiet and always having to like,
[1842.06s -> 1846.78s]  I needed to move around all the fucking time and it was kind of a detriment. So a lot of times,
[1847.58s -> 1859.40s]  but over the years I've obviously gotten a little better. I don't need to be down here.
[1859.96s -> 1883.00s]  I think I had high energy as a kid, but I was better at masking it. Yeah. I mean, everybody is,
[1883.00s -> 1888.70s]  everybody's different, right? So my situation versus your situation versus somebody else's
[1888.70s -> 1894.60s]  situation is always going to be different, but I had a lot of, you know, communication with,
[1894.60s -> 1901.77s]  you know, doctors and family and it was, uh, everybody's different. That's why it's kind of
[1901.77s -> 1907.77s]  a, usually a case by case basis a lot of times. All right. Where am I? I wonder if I need to go.
[1907.77s -> 1912.89s]  I'm going the complete wrong direction right now. How did I end up going back here?
[1913.53s -> 1920.39s]  Why did I go back here? I mean, it was cool. I got some kills, right? But what was it? What am
[1920.39s -> 1933.94s]  I doing over here? I'm sitting here explaining how I've had, Oh, ADHD over the years. And I've,
[1933.94s -> 1939.32s]  as I've been walking fucking backwards the whole time, that's just par for the course. I think,
[1939.32s -> 1958.52s]  isn't it? I rode the train all the way back here. All right. That was actually a nice,
[1958.52s -> 1960.52s]  that was actually a lot of help. I appreciate that actually.
[1971.48s -> 1975.53s]  Forget how to parry. No, I just feel like people have been behind me the whole time.
[1976.65s -> 1983.06s]  All right. Let's just, we're going to wait. Let's go. Just go, just go do the suplex. Oh, I will.
[1984.79s -> 2003.54s]  I tried to parry that and you can't parry that. Get out of here. I'm getting money at least.
[2005.00s -> 2022.28s]  I am just, I could have taken the cart back. Yeah, it's all right. I'm walking through the
[2022.28s -> 2028.89s]  whole game again. This is just absolutely quintessential. I know where I'm going.
[2030.01s -> 2045.90s]  No, you don't. I'm already in too deep though. I have to keep going. At least every door is open.
[2045.90s -> 2053.13s]  Hi. Are you all right? Yes. I seriously went so fucking far. I have to go through the whole
[2053.13s -> 2075.32s]  maze again. Should I just restart? No, I can go through here. No big deal. It's just a straight
[2075.32s -> 2094.46s]  path from here, is it? Is it a straight path from here? Through the left. Let's do a factory reset.
[2095.43s -> 2106.54s]  No, I'm just going to run. We're good. Glad I came back. It's 200 bucks.
[2106.78s -> 2125.86s]  Oh, I did not think that that was going to be here. Hey, we made it and I got the,
[2125.86s -> 2139.08s]  the uh, the goat head or whatever it is. This took us an extra five minutes to start.
[2144.36s -> 2165.48s]  Ah, this shit is ice cold today. Perfect. Okay. So, uh, I was going the right way.
[2167.69s -> 2177.21s]  I went back here from the cart, which I did not want to do that. I need to go up this way.
[2177.45s -> 2194.10s]  For a reason stranger. You're here. Maybe this is locked. It's locked. Here we go. Rats have
[2194.10s -> 2201.03s]  infested a section of the castle and are gnawing away at all the precious books. Uh, get rid of
[2201.03s -> 2209.86s]  the rats in the grand hall library. Imagining that's in here. Yeah. I don't know. I really
[2209.86s -> 2215.30s]  don't like doing this, but I'm gonna really don't like it. I don't want to shoot these rats.
[2217.74s -> 2232.73s]  I don't like it. That's something sacrilege about what I'm doing. This is, I don't like this. I
[2232.73s -> 2252.63s]  really don't like it. I don't like it. Statue of some snakes. I don't like it. Betrayed. Betrayer.
[2255.40s -> 2265.83s]  Dining hall. Oh, here. No, thanks. Puzzle time. Okay. The stork is looking at that chair right
[2265.83s -> 2270.15s]  there and that chair is sitting across from these drapes. These drapes are spread open. That means
[2270.15s -> 2276.54s]  two, one and two on either side, which is these two, these two are exactly 15 feet apart, which
[2276.54s -> 2286.47s]  is 15. Count to 15. One, two, three. That counts as four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. There
[2286.47s -> 2289.99s]  are only 10 seats. So subtract 10. So that means five. The answer to the door is five.
[2311.26s -> 2327.26s]  E is the fifth letter of the alphabet. All right. I'm done. It's like grandpa's birthday picture.
[2327.90s -> 2367.91s]  Are they eating napkins? All right. Two knives, fork, spoon, three knives, two forks, spoon. Okay.
[2368.55s -> 2379.82s]  And it was, that's his. He had two knives, eating a napkin, two knives, fork, spoon.
[2383.74s -> 2389.11s]  No, no. This is it right here.
[2389.75s -> 2429.61s]  Have a seat. No problem. Looks like we figured it out. Take it. Serpent head. The last one is over
[2429.61s -> 2466.20s]  here. I probably unlock it somehow. What is this item? Oh, it's this. Put this back on. Looks like
[2466.20s -> 2488.76s]  we're still missing a piece. There's a symbol on the wall. You hear it ticking. All right. I need
[2488.76s -> 2510.04s]  the, uh, I need the last head and it was in line. All right. I need the lion head. How do I get this?
[2510.04s -> 2531.37s]  Oh, should I miss an herb? What season are you? Uh, I like summer and winter both equally the same.
[2531.37s -> 2542.76s]  Where's this red herb? Oh, it's on the table. Summer and winter are my two favorite seasons.
[2546.54s -> 2551.08s]  Although if you're talking about smells, all smells the best. All has the best smell.
[2554.33s -> 2565.85s]  All has the best smell. Summer has the best body feel. Spring has the best visual and winter has
[2565.85s -> 2583.05s]  the best togetherness. There you go. I had a big raid. We got a big raid came in. Linkus. Thanks
[2583.05s -> 2593.77s]  for the raid, Linkus. Appreciate the raid. Welcome everybody. Togetherness. Yeah. That means usually
[2593.77s -> 2600.10s]  you can't really, winter is a kind of an indoor, um, season. I mean, unless you're, you know,
[2600.10s -> 2604.90s]  going skiing or you're out, uh, you gotta really bundle up. To me, winter is more like I'm drinking
[2604.90s -> 2609.54s]  a hot coffee or hot cocoa or something and I'm inside and we're watching a movie. You know what
[2609.54s -> 2619.66s]  I'm saying? I think that's pretty accurate for me. Maybe it's not accurate for you. We're different
[2619.66s -> 2628.25s]  people. This dude's addicted to coffee. I mean, probably. All right. What am I? Where's this last
[2628.25s -> 2659.26s]  head? We're here? Is there a door here? Oh, look, there might be a door there. They actually might
[2659.26s -> 2681.34s]  be. Yeah. Welcome, Raiders. There is a door there. Hey, Leon, there's some armor. Bet you could use
[2681.34s -> 2694.39s]  it like a bulletproof vest. Little old fashioned for my taste. Too bad. I'm pretty dashing. These
[2694.39s -> 2702.57s]  are going to move. I don't, I don't remember what happens in here, but we'll see. There is one more
[2702.57s -> 2721.22s]  of those right here. What is making that sound? I lost all my channel points voting for a turtle
[2721.22s -> 2728.50s]  in pre-stream. Sad. I don't even know the context of what you're saying. What does that even mean?
[2730.36s -> 2785.45s]  We were, where was there a turtle? There it is. What the hell? I need some yellow herbs. Ashley,
[2785.45s -> 2804.95s]  stay up there. Hey, be careful. These guys move. These guys move. There's no way these guys don't
[2804.95s -> 2827.96s]  move. Get all the items first. That's Resident Evil 101. Welcome to class. When you touch the thing,
[2827.96s -> 2835.43s]  25 enemies are going to run after you. Collect everything first. Everything. That is Resident
[2835.43s -> 2853.26s]  Evil 101. Welcome to the lesson. We're clear. I'm ready to start the encounter. Can't be serious.
[2857.40s -> 2898.18s]  That count? Oh, you can't parry that. That's not getting parried. Jesus. Oh shit. Oh shit.
[2926.76s -> 2938.28s]  Oh, you can parry it. What did you just do? What's going on?
[2964.02s -> 3002.52s]  Dude, I'm out. I'm out. I'm going to have to switch over to this. Damn. I'm almost out of
[3002.52s -> 3012.89s]  everything. I got no ammo. I'm almost completely clean out of everything.
[3024.97s -> 3036.31s]  Is this where this weapon is going to really shine? Because I got nothing. Time to utilize the weapon
[3036.31s -> 3062.62s]  that has infinite ammo if you're good. Stop minus twoing Leon. That's kind of rude. Yeah. Stop.
[3066.65s -> 3078.90s]  Oh, there it is. I got the cube. Hold on. I forgot to blink for like 45 minutes. Oh, damn.
[3085.45s -> 3111.99s]  Damn it. I need to save this ammo. There's one more somewhere in here.
[3112.87s -> 3126.42s]  One more wrap. Hook up a shock collar to have minus two and plus two activated.
[3128.23s -> 3135.38s]  If it's really bad, I just get electrocuted. How would that work? If there's more than like
[3135.38s -> 3145.08s]  500 minus twos in chat, I get shocked. I don't think so. What happens if I get a bunch of
[3145.08s -> 3159.96s]  plus twos then? What's the reward that I get? You get candy. A cookie. A candy dispenser.
[3159.96s -> 3170.58s]  A candy dispenser? What kind of weird experiment is this? There's just like a device that's in the
[3170.58s -> 3174.42s]  corner over here that if I get enough plus twos, like a little candy comes out and I'm like,
[3174.42s -> 3178.82s]  oh, I run over there and I unwrap it. What the hell kind of, what is the stream that you're
[3178.82s -> 3211.02s]  referring to? That's the idea. Matilda. I don't like it. I don't like first fire.
[3211.58s -> 3225.02s]  I always land the first shot and the other two just miss. I'll hold on to them for now.
[3225.42s -> 3240.92s]  I'll buy most anything. I don't always have this in stock stranger. Stocking up while you can.
[3284.73s -> 3302.04s]  Say something. I'm fine. I need to do a big turn in here. I've got like $200,000 worth of
[3302.04s -> 3324.49s]  shit in my inventory. W A S D Q E. Okay. I need that on the bottom. Is that correct? Yeah, that's
[3324.49s -> 3345.51s]  it. Where's the, there's another one of those. Where is it? It's over here, isn't it? That's it
[3345.51s -> 3358.50s]  right there, right? All right. It's somebody, I don't even know what the fuck that person's saying.
[3358.50s -> 3365.51s]  All right. This, that's it. It's, it's, it's back there. I'm going to take the car because I want
[3365.51s -> 3371.82s]  to go do the other cube thing because I will forget and I will not do it. It also might be over here
[3371.82s -> 3401.62s]  too. Why not yourself? Okay. Time to go on the car. Just behind me. This way. Okay. What do you
[3401.70s -> 3414.15s]  say? It's a fancy car. I don't know. Melt that thing down and go rebuild a fucking school.
[3414.15s -> 3418.07s]  You know what I'm saying? Like this thing, that could be made out of wood. It could be made,
[3418.07s -> 3430.06s]  it could put some nice gold trimming on it. You know what I mean? Like does that gotta be a $10
[3430.06s -> 3441.34s]  million? It could be a $1 million card. Does it gotta be a $10 million card? All right. Where is
[3441.34s -> 3451.30s]  it? Or is it up or is it across? Is it across? I think it could be a $5 million card. That could
[3451.30s -> 3489.30s]  be a $5 million card. All good. He's malding over golden pixels. I ate breakfast this morning. If
[3489.30s -> 3503.46s]  anyone's curious. No, he's supposed to fail. He's supposed to fail those puzzles for 20 fucking
[3503.46s -> 3531.16s]  minutes. I wasted my candy. Where's the candy dispense? Okay. But acting superior. Hey, this is
[3531.16s -> 3549.72s]  it. Imagine if I ever have a Disneyland ride to go to the kitchen, pause the movie and go to the
[3549.72s -> 3554.68s]  kitchen to get the popcorn. You need to get on a Disneyland ride to get there? I don't know, man.
[3554.68s -> 3564.90s]  I think that's a little, I think that's a little much. I think that's a little much. I hate big
[3564.90s -> 3570.82s]  fucking spaces. They piss me off. I don't know why. I do know why. Cause I lose shit all the time.
[3574.94s -> 3583.11s]  I need just a few rooms. You know what I'm saying? Too many places for me to, I would get lost.
[3596.15s -> 3601.91s]  Got to take Splash Mountain to get to your living room. I mean, that's like fucking funny.
[3602.79s -> 3616.46s]  That would be so annoying after a while. Okay. Well, what if, what if you do the Splash Mountain
[3616.46s -> 3623.82s]  ride to get to your, get to the kitchen and then you take like the, you know, the monorail back to
[3623.82s -> 3628.06s]  the living room and then you realize I left my fucking phone on the counter in the kitchen.
[3628.78s -> 3636.39s]  You have to ride Splash Mountain again. That would suck. You'd be like, I don't want to ride that
[3636.39s -> 3644.02s]  again. Or is it a case of you have so much money that you, there's a phone in every room?
[3644.02s -> 3656.39s]  You know what I always did want? This is back, um, back when cell phones really weren't a thing.
[3657.66s -> 3666.01s]  I always wanted one of those phones next to the toilet. I thought of, you know how much shit I
[3666.01s -> 3693.22s]  would be able to get done? I'd be able to get so much stuff done. This is loud. What are you getting
[3693.22s -> 3709.40s]  done? Meetings. That'd have to be a bunch of sound dampening. There's gotta be a bunch of sound
[3709.40s -> 3714.76s]  dampening in that room. In that room. I just said run because I'm about to run and my brain
[3714.76s -> 3741.43s]  replaced the word. Um, God, hold on. Ah, shine forward. That sounds like, um, like motivational
[3741.43s -> 3793.16s]  speak. Shine forward. That rat was fast as fucking, oh my God. Is that a clock? Resting
[3793.16s -> 3799.48s]  forbearers answer to the chosen time. It is it. If it is the Lord's blessing you seek,
[3799.48s -> 3849.98s]  have courage and fear. No darkness. Chosen time. What time is it? I got a watch. You know,
[3849.98s -> 3860.18s]  it's really, really interesting about all this. Are these real, are these real paintings from
[3860.18s -> 3868.97s]  or were these made specifically for the game? Think about the time and the effort that an
[3868.97s -> 3876.68s]  artist went into to do this. And it lives as this set piece to create this environment.
[3876.68s -> 3893.26s]  It's really cool. You just don't, you don't really even think about it, right? So as I walk through
[3893.26s -> 3899.58s]  these doors, somebody had to make all this. Somebody had to put all this here. That turtle
[3900.65s -> 3914.68s]  was placed here very particularly by somebody. I think we kind of forget that a lot. Sorry about
[3914.68s -> 3930.66s]  you losing all the, uh, all your money or whatever happened to you. Wait, why? I'm sorry. I just
[3930.66s -> 3941.77s]  ruined that whole moment I was having there. I hate that. I don't like when they're under that
[3957.21s -> 3983.80s]  hidden staircase, a secret room or something. Shit. I don't have that device. Bunch of keys.
[3986.87s -> 4047.54s]  Break this. Ashley can't kick that. God damn it. It can't get in here, right?
[4097.83s -> 4124.76s]  Oh, my God. It's this one. Whoa. Close the door. Close the door. Close it. Close it. Close it.
[4124.76s -> 4175.14s]  Close it. Close the door. Oh, shit. No. Leon, help. The key to getting out of this confounded
[4175.14s -> 4180.12s]  place is the Salazar family insignia. To find it, I must venture to where that cursed armor
[4180.12s -> 4188.07s]  awaits the underground mausoleum. Oh, merciful Lord, enact your righteous justice upon the wicked
[4188.07s -> 4195.05s]  surfer, the maniacal monster Ramon Salazar. May your blessed blue light protect your forever
[4195.05s -> 4213.18s]  faithful servant. Ooh, wait, what time is it? It is exactly almost four o'clock. Oh, wait,
[4213.18s -> 4228.49s]  do I know what this is? I mean, hold on. Let me, I don't open that yet.
[4235.54s -> 4255.90s]  1104. 1104 o'clock. I bet that works. I didn't use one of these keys,
[4255.90s -> 4275.58s]  so I missed out on something, but whatever. One hundred thousand dollars. There it is.
[4275.58s -> 4307.45s]  Let me save it first. I don't think I did. All right. 1104 is right here. Give me a candy. Yeah,
[4307.45s -> 4345.96s]  I got a blue gem. Give me a candy. All right. The other one is 1104. God damn it. The power
[4345.96s -> 4351.80s]  of the blinding light. I sentence you to hell. It works. Oh my God. It works. I forgot it worked.
[4351.80s -> 4415.54s]  I thought I was making a stupid joke. 1104. 1104. Quickly. Am I good? Am I safe? This is the scream
[4415.54s -> 4458.57s]  stream I've been waiting for. Well, just that section is just. Did they take that? Did they
[4458.57s -> 4462.49s]  take the elevator? Oh, I thought they took the elevator down. I was like, why do they have
[4462.49s -> 4470.87s]  intelligence like that? All right. Don't press any buttons until I know what the hell's going on in
[4470.87s -> 4505.91s]  here. OK, bird, moose, seahorse, snake, bird, moose, seahorse, snake, bird, bird, whatever, snake.
[4513.99s -> 4520.39s]  That's true. That's the best line of the whole game so far. This sucks.
[4531.80s -> 4541.67s]  Whoa. Oh my God. This doesn't close. That person. Wait, there was a gem in that eye.
[4542.39s -> 4589.99s]  How do I get it? I don't know. I need the. I get it. I get it. This sucks. That was great delivery
[4589.99s -> 4606.42s]  too on that line. That was very. That was like 10 out of 10 delivery. Is that correct? I need to flip
[4606.42s -> 4644.41s]  these. That was an insane puzzle. Oh, I don't even. I don't even have the thing. I don't even have
[4644.41s -> 4688.26s]  the lantern. Did I? Did I fuck that up? Oh God. What am I? The only one I haven't used. I just
[4688.26s -> 4708.12s]  almost exited the game. Holy shit. What the hell? Come on, come on, come on. Oh, that sucked.
[4708.12s -> 4735.06s]  I wonder if that's harder on a professional or hardcore. It's not over yet. God damn it.
[4735.06s -> 4762.49s]  God damn it. OK. Oh shit. I don't know where to go. Dude, I don't know where to go. I have no idea
[4762.49s -> 4809.06s]  where to go. Where do I go? Around this way? This is wrong. This is the wrong way. It's over here,
[4809.06s -> 4833.11s]  isn't it? Straight. No. Wait, it's not right here. Are you serious? No, I'm going the right way.
[4833.11s -> 4879.45s]  Stairs with a diamond is the right way. Oh, I knew that. Go. Thank you. Thanks for the help.
[4879.45s -> 4912.65s]  Change the outfit. I will. That was terrifying. Elpers. Oh, you need to be really sure about that,
[4912.65s -> 4944.50s]  bro. I can catch you. I think so. Oh yeah, there are the two weird predator enemies.
[4944.50s -> 4974.06s]  God, about that. That was a long chapter. That was all the hedge maze and everything. Time for
[4974.06s -> 4990.86s]  break? No, not yet. Maybe like another half hour, 40 minutes. Maybe like an hour. Sorry, nothing yet.
[4992.01s -> 4999.35s]  But my little helper is creating quite the commotion. Everything will work out just fine.
[5000.07s -> 5006.78s]  As long as you can keep your dog under control. Seven minutes. He's a good boy. Predictable.
[5008.23s -> 5039.70s]  Fine. Change your mind yet? Aida. Assuming you haven't. I've got a tip for you. How about a
[5039.70s -> 5053.06s]  FaceTime call? Seems like something big is about to go. Babysitting is tough. Hey, Aida. Aida.
[5053.06s -> 5057.90s]  That's such a funny concept. Now you're getting FaceTimed by Aida in this situation. It's like,
[5057.90s -> 5062.70s]  yeah, all right. Hey, you do the thing where you're like, hold on. Wait, I need to make
[5062.70s -> 5071.88s]  the corner way bigger so I can see how ugly I am. Hey, Aida. You know what I mean? Like,
[5071.88s -> 5087.50s]  you gotta make sure I look all right. Okay. I have $100,000 waiting for me over here.
[5097.02s -> 5114.73s]  I'm about to do a cool thing. Here we go. So we've got, she has it. She has it in her inventory.
[5114.73s -> 5127.45s]  Oh, well. Welcome. Got some rare things on sale, stranger. Well, this is the ultimate shotgun.
[5133.90s -> 5147.77s]  Body armor is less expensive now. Yeah. Look at all this stuff I have. I have to sell something.
[5152.90s -> 5159.58s]  I'm MinMaxAndy right now. I gotta sell, I have to sell something.
[5159.58s -> 5174.81s]  She dropped it. They're on the ground. What? Is that for real? She dropped it.
[5177.82s -> 5185.38s]  Oh, I am so glad that you said that because I, she didn't do that. She didn't say,
[5185.38s -> 5192.02s]  hey, Leon, turn away a little sack over and else she threw us the key. All right. Well, good to know.
[5196.46s -> 5218.95s]  Let's do it. Green, purple, red, blue, yellow, 100,000. It's a full two times bonus. Yeah. I
[5218.95s -> 5223.77s]  think this is the best possible thing you can do in the whole game, right?
[5223.77s -> 5236.22s]  Is there another five slotted item? All right. I could do this one too. I need, I want money.
[5236.22s -> 5247.27s]  I'm doing it. I want money. This can be filled in. You can do all red on this one,
[5247.27s -> 5263.88s]  which would be pretty cool. Look at this. Quad bonus. Oh yeah. That's, I don't think I've ever
[5263.88s -> 5270.97s]  seen that much money in the game. Here we go. 100,000, 60,000.
[5271.21s -> 5276.73s]  Ruby's all rubbish. It makes no difference. I just got an achievement for that.
[5280.84s -> 5295.29s]  All right. Now we're going to make some decisions here. I'm going to sell this shotgun. It's
[5295.29s -> 5302.60s]  another 152. Wait, I'm going to put the thing on. Hey, brief 4k is three or 4k. You know what I'm
[5302.60s -> 5340.44s]  saying? Three or 4k is three or 4k. I'm doing it. Oh yeah. All right. I have $292,000 to get this
[5340.44s -> 5351.24s]  thing to be ridiculous. Semi-automatic shotgun.
[5364.92s -> 5376.36s]  Oh, okay. Hold on. Oh my God. It's so expensive, but it's crazy.
[5382.68s -> 5384.52s]  I need some reload speed.
[5384.52s -> 5397.27s]  All right. This thing is disgusting right now.
[5400.31s -> 5411.11s]  This thing is filthy. You just emptied your whole account. Yeah. Into this.
[5414.65s -> 5417.13s]  You don't have any ammo for it. Fix that right now.
[5420.18s -> 5432.49s]  Welcome stocking up while you can. I knew you too. Pleasant.
[5434.09s -> 5454.84s]  Wait, I want to put the shotgun ammo thing on shotgun shells. Craft bonus. Okay. Shotgun
[5454.84s -> 5475.86s]  craft bonuses on six. This thing has 18 shots. Damn. All right. That's the, I can't wait to
[5475.86s -> 5491.38s]  use that thing. That thing is disgusting. You can hold 25 and I still remember I still have
[5493.69s -> 5503.93s]  what? Like 20 shots in the revolver. I've got 20 shots. I am ready to kill any boss in like four
[5503.93s -> 5515.56s]  hits. All right. How are we looking? Got some decent heals. I got pretty bad on ammo, but that's
[5515.56s -> 5521.96s]  why I'm going to use this for a little while. I'm going to replace, let me put this in a better spot.
[5522.52s -> 5547.32s]  All right. Let's move outfit change after this next little bit here. So where to? I did that.
[5547.96s -> 5558.74s]  Now the idea is I have to go this way. Let's go in. I want to go into the library back this way
[5558.74s -> 5577.86s]  because I want to open, I want to get the cube thing and then it's open to the right, right?
[5577.86s -> 5595.03s]  Right. Ashley is literally dead. Ashley is not dead. Wait, what's this? This is game progress
[5595.03s -> 5605.21s]  over there, but I don't want to do that yet. I seek a brave soul willing to dispose of that monstrosity
[5605.21s -> 5610.04s]  of a knight. Be warned is much stronger than the other as he cut down our best of the singles to
[5610.04s -> 5632.25s]  defeat the strong threat in the mausoleum. I don't think I need it. I don't need it.
[5643.62s -> 5683.78s]  I don't even need it. That's done. Yes. I actually do need to do this because I need
[5683.78s -> 5717.29s]  ammo and there's a lot of stuff to break down here. Let me turn this over. I missed every
[5717.29s -> 5722.12s]  single shot. Every, I should get an award for that. I should be given something for that.
[5761.98s -> 5801.40s]  Hi. I'm trying to save ammo. Oh, right in the throat. All right. I'm missing a couple of
[5801.40s -> 5823.67s]  arrows. Where are they? Am I missing arrows? Okay. So the thing is yellow diamond. Nice.
[5823.67s -> 5846.10s]  Not quite that way yet. I'm looking for that cube cube thing. I think it's actually upstairs.
[5846.10s -> 5857.85s]  They never break, but they can go out of reach. There it is. All right. What the hell's in here?
[5857.85s -> 5898.46s]  Oh my goodness. CQBR assault rifle. Damn. This was free. He uses rifle ammo. I'm probably
[5898.46s -> 5907.10s]  going to sell this and just put it all into the striker. That's really cool though. All right.
[5907.10s -> 5916.63s]  What else we got? I'm going all in. Yeah. That's how I play it. I don't spread it out. No, no, no.
[5916.63s -> 5921.35s]  I take, I pick one weapon and I put a million dollars into it and it kills every enemy in one
[5921.35s -> 5928.68s]  shot. Yeah. I got to be careful. I got to aim the shots well, but it kills every boss in three hits.
[5928.76s -> 5933.50s]  Just put a million dollars into one weapon and you don't have to worry about using other weapons.
[5933.50s -> 5944.18s]  Use other weapons. Why? Having 24 shotgun shots that deal 5 million damage. Why use the rifle?
[5944.18s -> 5954.47s]  I don't need to do that. All right. Let me go out this way. There's another one up here too.
[5955.03s -> 5977.02s]  It's in here. Yep. There it is. You can only kill 24 enemies. That's not accurate.
[5977.82s -> 5994.94s]  Golden links. Nice. Oh, the boss, a boss. It has a lot of help. I could finish this right
[5994.94s -> 6005.80s]  now. Or I could finish this one too with the triple. I wonder what's worth more. I think that
[6005.80s -> 6019.88s]  does it. So now I'm going to go this way. That's the game progress route. You are so bad. Why?
[6022.47s -> 6047.24s]  What are we talking about? Oh, you don't want to have like an omega shotgun. All right. Triple
[6048.04s -> 6076.63s]  37k. That's pretty good. 37, eight versus 40. All right. It's more economically viable to do this
[6076.63s -> 6099.19s]  one. It isn't 1.2 versus 1.4. This is going to affect the economy. It's fine. It's all right.
[6105.35s -> 6131.78s]  It's fine. It's fine. This thing's worth 20k. What is it to make the shotgun ammo? I need the blue one.
[6140.49s -> 6157.78s]  Thank you. Try that on for size. Let's go. 16.2 damage. Anything else I place in travel.
[6157.78s -> 6165.72s]  This thing is disgusting. It's going to kill everything in one hit. Stryker is the weakest
[6165.72s -> 6177.61s]  shotgun by far. I'll be, you'll see. I'll be fine. You'll get it. I made a new save file just in case
[6177.61s -> 6205.88s]  I completely fuck myself here. Magnum's already on and shotgun is already on, right? So we got
[6205.88s -> 6216.17s]  shotgun melee crit hit rate and Magnum crafting. The first shotgun has 25 points when maxed. Yeah,
[6216.17s -> 6221.96s]  but you can't go gung, gung, gung, gung, gung, gung and get the cut scene. You know what I'm saying?
[6223.43s -> 6229.19s]  Boss. I make the boss drop down to one knee. The Plagas comes out. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
[6229.19s -> 6255.64s]  boom. Cutscene. I think I'm going to be all right. All right. Back to it. Here and then left. All
[6255.64s -> 6266.49s]  right. We'll see. Somebody said, all right, we'll see. I got to sit closer to my desk. I have to
[6266.49s -> 6295.21s]  like reach over to get my drink. I'm too far away. The people want a new outfit. Oh shit.
[6304.81s -> 6321.98s]  I'm saving ammo. Look, look at how good I'm being. Fucking monsters. You just chose the
[6321.98s -> 6328.46s]  most controversial weapon in the Resident Evil community. How do you feel? Um, same as I did 10
[6328.46s -> 6340.81s]  minutes ago. What do you mean? Why is this? What do you mean controversial? Why is it so controversial?
[6356.74s -> 6380.54s]  Ow. That was, oh, okay. That's fucked with me. That was a really long window. I did not think
[6380.54s -> 6385.26s]  that window was going to be that long. I committed then I didn't commit and I committed and I didn't
[6385.26s -> 6419.51s]  commit. Lost an arrow. Take a shot in the ceiling. You must smell awful. I don't think so. Shotgun.
[6419.51s -> 6458.30s]  This thing doesn't even have a full slugs. Oh, good. I have a lot of health. All right. What's,
[6458.30s -> 6465.06s]  what, what's, what's controversial about what I did? Remember, try not to make every single
[6465.06s -> 6478.81s]  chat message as mean and referring to him challenge. Now, if one of these birds just went
[6479.53s -> 6497.86s]  wham, that would be scary. Oh, purple herb. That's max health, max ammo, and a full heel.
[6498.42s -> 6507.22s]  I can't fucking believe I found one. All right. July 2 years since my awakening,
[6507.22s -> 6513.46s]  Master Ramon has bestowed upon me a truly righteous undertaking to improve upon the flaws of our human
[6513.46s -> 6521.27s]  form, to seek perfection as observed in our anthropodal siblings. This cause I shall willingly
[6521.27s -> 6529.08s]  devote my life. January 4 years since my awakening, my efforts to transfuse the black liquid into the
[6529.08s -> 6536.04s]  body are at a precipice of success. The womb is the key. If your soul proves to be a highly
[6536.04s -> 6542.98s]  malleable and adaptive subject, and then a bunch of other bullshit that they did or something,
[6543.30s -> 6572.86s]  well, you can read it on your plate. It really was like another paragraph or two.
[6577.62s -> 6585.98s]  All right. I promise I will read the notes from now on. I will read the notes. I promise from now
[6585.98s -> 6670.63s]  on. Hey, oh my goodness. I didn't even fucking flinch. Where is this last one? Where is this?
[6679.90s -> 6695.18s]  This gave me a headache. I have a fucking headache. Where even was he?
[6750.42s -> 6784.86s]  Nice. Ow, my finger. How do I get over there? One, it's been like 15. I don't want you to die
[6784.86s -> 6863.08s]  there because I won't be able to get the item. I don't think they stopped spawning. What the fuck?
[6863.08s -> 6913.82s]  That thing was made out of stone. Get out of the fucking way. Get, get. Okay. There's still a
[6913.82s -> 6928.36s]  treasure. Where's the treasure? Get away from, I'm trying to get the treasure. Fuck off. Oh my God,
[6928.36s -> 6982.84s]  you're an annoying little shit, aren't you? Okay. How do I get out of here? That way. Oh wait,
[6982.84s -> 7042.15s]  I want all the items, everything. Come on. I want everything. Give me everything. I feel like I've
[7042.15s -> 7046.68s]  been walking around here for like an hour. How long have I been walking around this place?
[7046.68s -> 7060.22s]  Did that not wait? What did that just open? Did that not open this? Wait, what just happened?
[7060.22s -> 7077.50s]  I didn't, I didn't open that gate. There's one on the other side, isn't there? Feel you right behind
[7077.50s -> 7133.70s]  me that way. I have to fight up the ladder. I tried to parry it. I just suck. I'm getting so
[7133.70s -> 7160.89s]  many blue sapphires. Finally. Pretty good, pretty good farm spot. Yeah, I'll take it.
[7160.89s -> 7188.87s]  Got a lot of handgun ammo. How come you skipped the night boss? Oh yeah, I did. I didn't mean to.
[7198.68s -> 7228.62s]  I forgot. Why is it painted? Oh, you're able to go back right now? I really don't want to run
[7228.62s -> 7242.09s]  through all these bugs again. Are they, are they gone? No, they are not. I missed it. Sorry,
[7242.09s -> 7287.61s]  I missed it. It's all there is to it. I missed it. It's okay. Another time. Oh shit. Oh shit,
[7287.61s -> 7300.18s]  that's those. I was silent before. Now I'm not. Oh, okay. Okay. I'm not quiet anymore.
[7300.18s -> 7303.78s]  They just, they got up. They're out. They're out. All right. This is why I,
[7303.78s -> 7329.24s]  this is the reason why I got this weapon. Just like I fucking planned. It's got to be the boom,
[7329.24s -> 7331.80s]  boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom in the back. And I'm going to kill one in a second.
[7331.80s -> 7359.94s]  Ready? Here we go. Flashbang going out. What is this? What? What happened? I couldn't shoot him.
[7361.82s -> 7370.46s]  It's not hitting him. What's going on? Is the armor on the back have to be taken care of?
[7372.12s -> 7376.90s]  I think it's the armor on the back is not gone. I shot the wrong one.
[7376.90s -> 7380.18s]  Whatever. All right. It's the point still stands. That would have been awesome.
[7382.12s -> 7391.14s]  Okay. And dude, only use this. They can't hear this. It's silent.
[7391.14s -> 7396.54s]  Just wait till they come over here. Take them out one by one. Quietly.
[7399.13s -> 7455.67s]  Only headshots. Only. I gotta go. Can I pull them out of his head? Quiet. We have been silent.
[7456.94s -> 7544.30s]  We're very good. Extra bolts. I hate it. No way, dude. Somebody just threw something at me.
[7544.30s -> 7569.78s]  I think they just spawn forever. They do. They just spawn forever. Okay. Well, you know what?
[7569.78s -> 7596.38s]  Then come on then. Come on then. Come on. What? Why can he hear me?
[7616.06s -> 7640.09s]  I don't want to use it. Oh my fucking God. Okay. All right. I got a fucking, I got a,
[7640.09s -> 7650.42s]  I got a flashbang. Nice shotgun. I haven't even had an opportunity to use it. Don't even give me
[7650.42s -> 7666.74s]  shit for that. I've got to make the floggers come out and then unload. I'm just going in.
[7666.74s -> 7774.20s]  I'm going in. Yeah. Yeah. I thought he was dead. I fucked it up. What the fuck just happened?
[7775.50s -> 7785.66s]  I'm made out of fucking. All right. I'm going to do it fucking. I'm going to do it for real now.
[7785.66s -> 7821.30s]  I'm going to do it for real and not get shit. Push four. Why can I not press a
[7821.30s -> 7860.31s]  button on my fucking keyboard? I always press like two accidentally. Get out of my fucking way.
[7894.07s -> 7930.09s]  Yeah. I got a beer back. I shit my pants. All right. Two unicorn horns. That was so scary.
[7930.09s -> 7937.98s]  Does anybody else have this problem where you got one, two, three, four on your keyboard
[7938.06s -> 7949.00s]  and from W going from W to three or two, I always end up going like this. I hit just like three of
[7949.00s -> 7974.23s]  them, but I just, I can't do it. It was worth it. I got to use the mines. No, I made this bed. I
[7974.23s -> 8000.74s]  have to sleep in it. Remember the Magnum that you're never going to use. I will use it. I'll
[8000.74s -> 8008.66s]  use the Magnum just wait. I just like stabbed myself in the eye with my fingernail. I was,
[8008.66s -> 8013.70s]  that's so annoying. I so badly wanted to scratch my eye with my other hand when I
[8013.70s -> 8027.11s]  could have just used the right, the actual, the left hand too busy gaming. No, we're good.
[8027.11s -> 8038.01s]  What treats do you want? Um, I'm good right now. I think I got everything. All right. Let's go.
[8043.61s -> 8049.02s]  I also didn't even have a working knife that whole time. Turn the lights off. They're already
[8049.50s -> 8086.55s]  actually.
[8114.92s -> 8116.28s]  Just kind of mask on this.
[8138.89s -> 8139.61s]  Kennedy.
[8176.41s -> 8208.23s]  Hang in there, Ashley. I'm coming for you. I'll be fine. Give up the ghost. Anything down here?
[8210.36s -> 8218.33s]  Oh, I remember this part is so scary. If I remember it's when, yep. Oh, I hate this part.
[8218.33s -> 8236.28s]  This is the sewer, right? Oh, it's the worst. It actually is awful. Talk about sticking the landing.
[8294.70s -> 8334.01s]  Bugs. Get the fuck away from me. Where is that? Where this place? Lots of blue gems though.
[8334.01s -> 8394.55s]  You guys weren't lying. Don't do that. Oh shit. Okay. They move so fast through the water. It
[8394.55s -> 8433.86s]  sucks. Probably an item down here. It's going to run item. Run, run, item. Run. Really? Nothing,
[8433.86s -> 8453.62s]  nothing at all. I guess a little bit of these things heal for a hundred percent health.
[8453.62s -> 8480.78s]  If I put that keychain on, maybe I should farm a couple here. There's another place to go.
[8480.78s -> 8497.94s]  Yeah, there's an item over here. Do this IRL. Twix or payday candy bar. The people need to know
[8497.94s -> 8523.37s]  Twix every day. Twix all day every day. I can't get that. I really, really want that. Which,
[8523.37s -> 8527.77s]  which, but left or right Twix. I open the package and close my eyes and just like spin it around
[8527.77s -> 8530.65s]  and spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin, spin. And then I just take one. I can't decide.
[8531.29s -> 8553.29s]  Probably drop down here. I'll read it. Another one dead. How long has it been since I was thrown
[8553.29s -> 8557.86s]  down here? The meager scraps of food provided in the beginning are gone and they don't give us
[8557.86s -> 8563.19s]  anymore. The pains of hunger and thirst are unbearable. Most have resorted to drinking
[8563.19s -> 8571.91s]  the black water. The first to turn was Herminio. He was so weak that he couldn't even walk,
[8571.91s -> 8577.53s]  but then suddenly became mad. By the time his rampage ended, two were dead. I think we shouldn't
[8577.53s -> 8586.58s]  drink that dark liquid. Dear Abelardo has passed, though he fought until the very end. The only thing
[8586.58s -> 8592.39s]  I can do now is honor the bodies and pray that their souls find peace. Oh Lord, why do you test
[8592.39s -> 8622.18s]  us so? Another crown. Another crown. I can do a triple in here. We'll see. Okay. I really do badly
[8622.18s -> 8642.58s]  want that item down here and I'm going to get it. There we go. Okay. Finally. No, no, no, no, no, no,
[8642.82s -> 8685.56s]  I already have one made. Cool. I need to repair this. This thing filled back up. Very nice. Give
[8685.56s -> 8711.35s]  me a break. It's this part. I hate this part. I'm just going to warn everybody. I'm probably going
[8711.35s -> 8720.23s]  to scream at least five to 10 times during this part. Um, there's nothing I can do about it.
[8723.02s -> 8731.54s]  This is where the game turns into a granny like and it's a granny like on crack. Uh huh. It's
[8731.54s -> 8735.38s]  not going to be fun. Very much not looking forward to this is probably my least favorite
[8735.38s -> 8762.17s]  part of the whole game is this next hour or so. Yeah, well I'll take a break. Let me just do this
[8762.17s -> 8789.42s]  first. Oh, that's a lot of gunpowder. You have anything new? Let me take a look at this shit.
[8795.24s -> 8805.70s]  Three blues will fit in here and I'll be just fine. Although is that going to be bad for later?
[8806.18s -> 8824.82s]  25k. I think it's fine. 7,000. So let's do, let's just get these in here.
[8836.31s -> 8843.51s]  But anytime welcome got a selection of good things on sales, a deal well struck.
[8846.33s -> 8850.33s]  You've exhausted our normal range of services for this weapon.
[8850.33s -> 8855.61s]  If you're interested in something more, well, you catch my drift. Let's see.
[8855.61s -> 8861.85s]  Rolls are gross. All right. Here's the problem. It's 30 well tuned weapon can make up for a
[8862.01s -> 8869.78s]  this is going to have almost 50 shots in it. You don't even have the ammo to fill one magazine.
[8869.78s -> 8876.44s]  I'm all right. I still got money to put into this. See, everything's going to be fine.
[8882.14s -> 8888.52s]  You're the worst resident evil four player. No, I'm using a gun you don't like.
[8888.52s -> 8896.92s]  Let's just get this. We're starting to get an idea of your taste.
[8905.45s -> 8917.43s]  What you see is why I don't always. I use these so often. I'm just going to use it. You know what
[8917.43s -> 8934.84s]  I mean? Yourself killed now. Very cool. I could put the thing on and just use this and get a full
[8934.84s -> 8962.89s]  heel. That's what I mean. Let's top myself off. I'm going to get topped off. Okay. I'm going to be our
[8962.89s -> 8971.35s]  bee. I'll be right back. And from here, I'll put on a new costume and we'll be right back.
[8971.35s -> 8975.19s]  Give me like two, three minutes, maybe five minutes or so in a minute.
[9305.67s -> 9568.66s]  Okey dokey. How are you? Refilled my drink. Got a little bit of stretches out of the way.
[9568.90s -> 9581.50s]  Move my legs a little. Preparing myself for this part coming up. I'm talking this up like crazy.
[9581.50s -> 9599.51s]  Watch this. Not even be a big deal. No, there's no way it's not. Okay. Hello. Can you see me?
[9599.51s -> 9615.75s]  Not yet. You will be in a minute. Comfortable. Turn the gamma down on this. Is the lighting fine on
[9615.75s -> 9633.62s]  the? I'm a little orange. I mean, it kind of looks like that in here anyways. Whatever. I'm good.
[9633.62s -> 9660.84s]  Let me know if the audio is not any good because I had to change it for the music.
[9660.84s -> 9664.52s]  How bad would you laugh if in 10 hours I can't beat the game because of the shotgun I have and
[9664.52s -> 9670.33s]  I have to go back and do this and get the rifle? I would laugh out loud. Oh my God. I would laugh
[9670.33s -> 9703.67s]  out loud. Outfit change. You're right. You're right. Hero or villain? Villain in cut scenes,
[9703.67s -> 9732.50s]  I think would be really funny. Let's do villain for now. I guess we'll do that for now. Bro,
[9732.50s -> 9746.94s]  take the glasses off. No, the glasses stay. The glasses stay. I look like I'm in the fucking
[9746.94s -> 9752.18s]  night's watch. This is going to be so distracting. I already know it. I can't wait to turn it off.
[9752.18s -> 9769.64s]  I already hate it. Well, everything's good. Move. Look like a Bloodborne character. Yeah,
[9769.64s -> 9789.99s]  the Bloodborne mod. What is? I hear it. Where is it? Here it is. Okay. No more stalling. It's time
[9789.99s -> 9803.21s]  to go. But there's a treasure over here and I'm going to get it. Ooh, I think I can make a new
[9803.21s -> 9831.38s]  thing. Oh, not even close. Chris Angel. Do you get partial credit for that little side quest or do
[9831.38s -> 9848.28s]  you have to get all 16? Dude, you look like a buzzard. You got to get them all. Installation
[9848.28s -> 9851.48s]  of the liquid nitrogen showers that were requested last month have been completed.
[9852.20s -> 9863.11s]  Caution. Liquid nitrogen is extremely hazardous. Yep. It's this part. I'm not going to scream.
[9886.57s -> 9891.26s]  May, nine years since my awakening. Upon the release of this valve, black liquid shall enter
[9891.26s -> 9900.68s]  my veins and circulate throughout my entire body. I expect this will be the most painful experience
[9900.68s -> 9906.12s]  of my life. I await the trial with great anticipation. It is an honor to suffer through
[9906.12s -> 9912.31s]  the holy labor of rebirth. The next time I awaken, it will be as a true servant of master Ramon.
[9912.95s -> 9920.97s]  I, Isidro Uriarte Talavera, make this vow. I will surpass the limitations of man and become
[9920.97s -> 9927.45s]  a true servant of God. I will find the heretics and serve as their executioner. Their verdugo.
[9927.45s -> 9952.49s]  On powder. These people are not right. You have a long time to figure that out, Leon.
[9958.15s -> 9972.15s]  Oh, a boot knife. Put that on. Put the boot knife on because I think I can use it to kick,
[9972.15s -> 9979.03s]  right? Especially for this part. Hold on. There's more shit here.
[9981.99s -> 9986.41s]  Out of service. To conserve electricity, the power has been turned off for some equipment,
[9986.41s -> 9991.10s]  including the elevator. It can be restored by flipping the circuit breaker. Look at at the
[9991.10s -> 10017.34s]  very back of the laboratory. Great. Where is it? I can hear it. Oh, I'm looking right at it. Nice.
[10017.90s -> 10038.92s]  Make sure I get everything. I think I've got everything. All right. I'm not going to scream.
[10039.48s -> 10152.15s]  Oh, did I waste it? I can hear this motherfucker. Oh, it's at C. C is the worst place for that.
[10152.15s -> 10176.07s]  I can't rely. If we press C, let me get all the items in here first. I know there's probably a
[10176.07s -> 10241.27s]  couple. Let's go. What did I not do this? Why did I not do this earlier? Why did I not do this
[10241.27s -> 10263.10s]  earlier? Why did I not do that earlier? Press the button. Press it, please.
[10292.57s -> 10353.22s]  Oh, my God. My God. Get off me. Get off me. Get off me. Oh, my God. Press the button,
[10353.22s -> 10410.76s]  please. You fucking dumbass. Press the button. Where's E? Oh, shit. It didn't work. Oh, my God.
[10410.76s -> 10416.52s]  Oh, my God. Fucking greedy. I'm so greedy.
[10457.42s -> 10500.06s]  Fucking gross. All right. We're not leaving yet. Imagine that on a higher difficulty. Oh, yikes.
[10500.06s -> 10509.85s]  Is my least favorite part about the whole game? Not because I don't like it, but because it's
[10509.85s -> 10514.23s]  just so scary and so stressful. It's a granny-like disease just constantly running after you.
[10514.23s -> 10526.74s]  Oh, yeah. There was one more nitrogen. I was panicking too much. It's not easy on hardcore.
[10526.74s -> 10532.90s]  I do not envy people playing on hardcore or professional against this fight because it
[10532.90s -> 10563.11s]  fucking sucks. I want to get in there. This door, right? Good. Oh, I'm really glad I came in here.
[10565.29s -> 10572.73s]  You made that look pretty easy. The only reason why I did not lose probably three or four times
[10572.73s -> 10578.23s]  there is just because I've done it before. I knew you had to do the nitrogen spray,
[10579.77s -> 10584.33s]  but it still kind of doesn't matter. It's still a big scary monster running after you.
[10592.47s -> 10609.00s]  I should... How am I doing on items and stuff? Now, here's a little tidbit. You actually don't
[10609.00s -> 10617.82s]  have to kill that thing. I think most people's first playthroughs, they'll probably just get away.
[10618.62s -> 10628.63s]  You actually don't have to kill it, but I wanted to. You can outweigh it. Yeah. You can just kind
[10628.63s -> 10643.08s]  of run around in a circle. That's why I made all the flashbangs, by the way.
[10672.70s -> 10676.94s]  Salvation, as you wish.
[10685.24s -> 10688.20s]  Coming back to that is just not... You're never prepared for it.
[10689.08s -> 10707.38s]  I've already turned. My character has already turned. I've been completely infected at this
[10707.38s -> 10720.81s]  point. Oh, you get points for actually killing it. That's cool. Pretty good score. That's pretty
[10720.81s -> 10730.74s]  good. I'm not playing on hardcore, but I think that's pretty good. I'll take a 90. Second
[10730.74s -> 10735.50s]  playthrough will be hardcore. I don't think I'll ever do professional, though. You need to be
[10735.50s -> 10740.86s]  next level with your aim and awareness and... I think it's like you die in like one or two hits,
[10740.86s -> 10759.24s]  right? There's no autosaves or anything? Can't you only save like five times or something in
[10759.24s -> 10782.23s]  professional? Something awful? 15. This character does not belong here.
[10782.71s -> 10785.51s]  Why help me, though? What's in it for you?
[10786.79s -> 10790.07s]  No need to be suspicious. I said I'd help you, didn't I?
[10795.34s -> 10815.30s]  Nice OC. I haven't got the red contacts in. Make your way to the surface. Everybody's so winded in
[10815.30s -> 10834.38s]  the remake. October 11. Today was the worst day of my life. It's my daughter's fifth birthday,
[10834.38s -> 10840.57s]  but here I am stuck on a mangy boat heading out to some backcountry dump. If it weren't for the
[10840.57s -> 10847.18s]  pay, no one would be willing to work out in the middle of nowhere a week later. Those in the castle
[10847.18s -> 10852.06s]  are always reminding us to take care during the excavation, but a few workers collapsed after
[10852.06s -> 10857.58s]  inhaling some dust. There's something going on here that they're not telling us. There are too
[10857.58s -> 10864.63s]  many secrets. I've started coughing, too. I should sleep. Nothing's really wrong with me. I threw up
[10864.63s -> 10869.78s]  blood three more times today, and I'm so weak I can barely move. Shit. I never should have come
[10869.78s -> 10875.22s]  down here. I came for the money, but instead I'm the one paying the price. I'm a terrible father.
[10875.38s -> 10883.59s]  I'm so sorry, sweetheart. You deserve better. Since morning my- Since morning head don't work.
[10883.59s -> 10890.14s]  Why? More blood threw up. Many insects crawling. I hear a voice. This is what I'm talking about.
[10890.14s -> 10896.49s]  This is what I wanted. New day. A fine day to work. Digging brings me so much joy. I am full
[10896.49s -> 10902.78s]  of happiness. I offer it all to you. Everything for you. Do you know what I mean? This is the caveman
[10902.78s -> 10907.86s]  kind of talk that I was looking for. The- Since morning head don't work. Okay, you're having-
[10908.02s -> 10912.18s]  Something went wrong. Yeah, your head hurts. Why? You threw up blood. I puked. There's insects
[10912.18s -> 10920.62s]  everywhere, and I hear things. We don't need all this. You know what I mean? Me like small word.
[10929.64s -> 10941.46s]  Ooh. There's only one. It's limitless, though. Should I just piss off every single person here
[10941.46s -> 10945.70s]  and just save for this and just get 50 rounds in this shotgun and that's how I end the playthrough
[10945.70s -> 10953.48s]  is just have 50 bullets in the shotgun at the last boss. That's so stupid.
[10959.72s -> 10965.80s]  It's 60,000 and that ticket. And I'll have 48 shots in this gun.
[10970.49s -> 10976.57s]  Why not? It's stupid and fun. I might as well try it. It's 60,000. Oh, or the ticket.
[10977.45s -> 10988.25s]  Oh, I thought it was needed both. I can make that happen. Look at that. 30,000.
[10991.05s -> 10997.51s]  So if you kill that, um, that boss, you get 30k. That's pretty cool. Nice.
[11004.28s -> 11006.34s]  Ooh, I can make bullets.
[11016.62s -> 11043.83s]  Grenades. Nah, I'm a flashbang kind of guy. These are close, although I should probably
[11043.83s -> 11056.55s]  save it for here. What's the five, right? Five colors. So I would need to do green, purple,
[11058.87s -> 11077.48s]  red. Okay. So take these out. I want another 100k. Green, purple. I need a purple. And then I could
[11077.48s -> 11093.99s]  do blue. Yellow. I see a purple. We get another 100k. Be on the lookout for purple gem as I need
[11093.99s -> 11112.57s]  one. All right. In the meantime, I think I'm going to save the money, although I might as well just
[11112.57s -> 11116.41s]  keep one of the, I've been using this a lot more frequently. Have you noticed that? I think I'm
[11116.41s -> 11138.33s]  going to use that. I've been using this a lot. Starting to see why this thing is really great.
[11144.41s -> 11154.52s]  Is it worth 27,000? I could always sell it in the end. This could be the difference. This thing
[11154.52s -> 11158.04s]  already has saved me at least two or three times with me being able to shoot and not worry about
[11158.04s -> 11207.29s]  ammo. So I think it's all right. Oh no. Let's go. I already have enough. Ooh, okay. Nice red nine
[11207.29s -> 11241.85s]  and then two handgun only. Try it out. I need to check. We got to check. I need to check this
[11241.85s -> 11262.94s]  shit. They hide in the barrels sometimes with the skulls. I wonder if they're in the barrels.
[11262.94s -> 11309.54s]  How many are there actually? Oh no, there are no hidden ones. Okay. Come on, dude. You fucked it
[11309.54s -> 11354.44s]  up. That's it. No bonus round. Was it not fast enough? Wait for the fucking grenade guy.
[11403.94s -> 11412.30s]  Where's the, that's all I fucking care about. Okay. Good. All right. I don't care about anything
[11412.30s -> 11424.34s]  else. I don't care. I wanted the gold coin. There it is. We're good. Want the S and we want 100%.
[11424.34s -> 11429.72s]  I need those gold coins. All right. I'm not sure. Is this the one that shoots?
[11433.29s -> 11437.86s]  Whoa. What the hell? Wait, that's confusing. This thing shoots through people.
[11438.50s -> 11474.17s]  You looking greasy? You don't think I know that? You don't think I, you don't think I'll be the
[11474.17s -> 11490.25s]  first person to tell me that I'm a greasy motherfucker? Fuck. I got to wait a long,
[11490.25s -> 11501.58s]  a lot longer than that. I got to wait longer. It's about piercing eight. There are eight of those.
[11501.58s -> 11540.23s]  Holy shit. I don't think I'm doing that. Come on, man. Come on, man. What are you talking about?
[11540.23s -> 11581.82s]  Right there. Wait for, you got to wait for four. You got, I got to wait a long time on this one
[11581.82s -> 11587.58s]  when they line up. Ready? Right there. I mean, that's, that's how you do it.
[11589.32s -> 11595.96s]  Kraken. Kraken. I was just gonna say Kraken. Your feet aren't glued to the floor.
[11596.28s -> 11605.96s]  I have, thanks Kraken. Welcome everybody. Thanks for the raid. Playing Resident Evil 5. It's four.
[11605.96s -> 11634.10s]  I say, why do I keep saying five? But welcome everybody. I didn't wait again. I don't like this
[11634.10s -> 11641.77s]  one. I'm not a fan. I don't like this one. I have to wait too long. I hate waiting. I hate waiting.
[11641.77s -> 11667.06s]  I hate this one. Shoot. Give me the, I hate shoot. I hate waiting. I hate waiting. I hate this one.
[11667.06s -> 11695.91s]  This is the machine gun one. Throw them away. No. Fucking can't. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it.
[11714.22s -> 11737.22s]  Get out of the fucking way. How do I get to the bonus round? Destroy all pirates
[11737.22s -> 11818.12s]  in 10 shots or less. Oh, that sucks. One, two, three, four, five, six. Oh no. I didn't get them all.
[11820.36s -> 11835.21s]  Which one did I miss? Shit. I wonder which one I missed. I didn't see it. I'm one of the pirates.
[11835.21s -> 11846.55s]  Wait, restart it. What's the condition on this one? 10 shots or less. Okay. Let's try it.
[11869.53s -> 11890.98s]  Three, four, five. Oh, come on, dude. You got to be shitting me. That was bait. No, what are you
[11890.98s -> 11908.44s]  doing? Now I'm just shooting. I fucking hate these. I'm going to eat my fucking microphone.
[11949.02s -> 11959.08s]  How do I do that one? I guess it's bait. All right. So some of these are bait.
[11971.38s -> 11994.55s]  Fuck. That's three, right? Four, five. What are you talking about, video game? Are you on fucking
[11994.55s -> 12046.30s]  crack? I shot it directly in the face. Did it hit the ceiling? Perfect. Perfect. Put your head down.
[12046.30s -> 12073.98s]  Put your head down. Get down. That's it, right? I got to have gotten it right there. That's eight,
[12073.98s -> 12105.59s]  right? Yeah. Let's try this one more time. What the fuck? How did it hit the guy? It was the
[12105.59s -> 12182.30s]  fucking triangle. Fuck. Just wait till they come over here. And that would have been 100%. It would
[12182.30s -> 12220.97s]  have been every single fucking one. I'm done. Two, one. Or should I just go three? That's actually
[12220.97s -> 12250.55s]  kind of good. I would have loved that earlier. Nothing kind of sucks. Another rare. 30% off body
[12250.55s -> 12255.83s]  repairs. That's really good. But is it actually 30% or is it full of shit? The other one was bad.
[12255.83s -> 12267.96s]  Dude, Ashley is dying and you're buying gumballs. I mean, I got to relax a little.
[12270.76s -> 12294.07s]  Rare. 100% recovery item. Resale value. Like if I herbs and stuff, why would I sell herbs?
[12294.07s -> 12306.66s]  Looks cool though. Feels cool. Nice. That's it, right? I forgot. He scared the shit out of me. I
[12306.66s -> 12311.46s]  forgot he was here. I just saw a guy with a gun walking towards me and I was like, what is happening
[12311.46s -> 12322.33s]  right now? I love the shooting range. I love it. I don't like that other gun though. Green, red,
[12322.33s -> 12335.58s]  yellow herb combo sells for 20,000 with that trinket. What do you mean? Hold on. Where's the
[12335.58s -> 12375.37s]  typewriter? Let's take a look. All right. Let's, I'm curious. Got a selection of good things on
[12375.37s -> 12391.11s]  sale, stranger. I'll buy almost anything. So this is normally 2,000. All right. Let me take it off
[12391.11s -> 12400.78s]  and see what it does. Uh, I think I, yeah, the gunpowder one's, I think the one I want.
[12401.94s -> 12420.26s]  Melee. All right. Get this off. I'll keep the shotgun one on. I'll just keep the chicken one on,
[12420.82s -> 12423.94s]  maybe. Yeah, just keep this. If I run into an egg, I run into an egg.
[12424.50s -> 12433.26s]  Beetle, chicken, fish. Yeah, but there's no reason to keep, have this on right now if I'm
[12433.26s -> 12451.91s]  not going to be near the merchant. So now let's see. What does that sell for now? Yeah. So that's
[12451.91s -> 12469.83s]  pretty cool. I think I'm good to go. Okay. Very, very fun. Very cool. What an exciting experience.
[12469.83s -> 12481.94s]  Let's go. My faith in someone who used to work for Umbrella. So you heard, huh? Umbrella's done
[12481.94s -> 12489.29s]  for. You don't need to worry about them anymore. You didn't answer my question. What are you after?
[12489.29s -> 12496.33s]  I just want to feel good about myself, make amends or something like that. Ooh, stuff.
[12499.37s -> 12517.00s]  Oh yeah, this is a mine shaft. Don't you actually ride a mine cart? I definitely shouldn't use this
[12517.00s -> 12529.10s]  then. I'll lose all the bolts. What are we doing on crafting? Can I craft anything? If I'm going to
[12529.10s -> 12539.93s]  use it, I'm going to use it. Seeing the light on this one. Dynamite has been relocated to the M4
[12539.93s -> 12561.85s]  store room. When using explosive, cave-ins are a frequent occurrence. Watch out. That's going to
[12561.85s -> 12574.38s]  be a fun puzzle. Looking forward to it. Crossbow's been carrying these last few chapters. It actually
[12574.38s -> 12592.49s]  kind of has. I've talked a lot of shit about it. Oh, we're going over. This looks really,
[12592.49s -> 12601.74s]  really nice down here. Oh, shit. Okay. Okay. Time for this thing to shine. Are you ready?
[12603.05s -> 12608.02s]  This is where this shines. Come on over here. Run over here. Do what you want to do. Watch this.
[12608.98s -> 12627.64s]  Hello. It just clocked me in the head with the shovel. I would be out before I...
[12635.88s -> 12653.27s]  What up? What's up now, huh? Ow. Stop. How many fucking bombs do you guys have?
[12654.23s -> 12703.50s]  Put that down. Put it down. Put it down. Oh, she's just punching. What the fuck are you doing?
[12726.58s -> 12752.38s]  I got to press a button or something, right? All right. Where's... There's got to be a lever
[12752.38s -> 12785.59s]  or something. Another chainsaw? Why would you knock her out of that? The shotgun is
[12785.59s -> 12802.98s]  fucking stacked. Stacked. All right. This way. Do we have to do, you know, throw them up there?
[12803.54s -> 12871.11s]  Here we go. What's just happened? Edgar Allen. Oh, looking fast. Shit. Broken. Dynamite.
[12881.98s -> 12896.79s]  He just... Sorry. Dynamite. All right. Let's go walk around. Jeremy, can you pause the stream?
[12896.79s -> 12913.37s]  I got to go to bed. Um, is it good now? Okay. Time to walk around and make sure I didn't
[12913.37s -> 12929.37s]  miss anything, which there's a bunch of shit. Yep. Very cool. Just screenshot the stream.
[12929.93s -> 12949.06s]  All right. There are actually a couple of few things I missed. There. Okay. There's one over
[12949.06s -> 12977.86s]  this way. Herb. Yep. There's my bolts back. I hear one of those things. Where is it? The other
[12977.86s -> 13005.86s]  treasure is up there. All right. Let's get out of here. Just a legendary loot. Oh, I think I got
[13005.86s -> 13039.67s]  everything. I have to go around and drop down. All right. Seen like an hour when they finished
[13039.67s -> 13066.07s]  this. That's not a puzzle. That's not a puzzle. Jesus. Oh, I didn't know it was going to roll
[13066.07s -> 13087.21s]  all the way. I thought it was going to cave in. Wait a minute. Why did it take arrows from me?
[13087.21s -> 13095.53s]  I had 12 before. Okay. I just almost freaked out. I was going to say I don't have to do the whole
[13095.53s -> 13108.50s]  thing over. Right. Okay. There we go. I got to get all the stuff again. This one and it's hanging
[13108.50s -> 13126.95s]  up here. That one. And there's one across there that way. Wait, is it? No, it's in that little
[13126.95s -> 13145.83s]  quarter. It's my favorite tea. I really like green tea. Oh, no, I already did this. I like green. I
[13145.83s -> 13169.50s]  like, um, I like white tea. Okay, let's go. I should black tea kind of has a very distinct
[13169.50s -> 13174.79s]  kind of bitter flavor that I don't really love. I love it when it's here's the thing. I know a
[13174.79s -> 13179.22s]  lot of you probably are going to agree with this and we're just going to talk about it for a second.
[13179.22s -> 13186.73s]  If I make, if I brew black tea and I put sugar in it or I sweetened it somehow, I don't even,
[13186.73s -> 13192.25s]  it doesn't, it's so it's different than if you were to buy an iced tea from the store and drink
[13192.25s -> 13199.67s]  it in just a sweetened iced tea. It tastes way better to me and I can never figure out why.
[13199.67s -> 13205.03s]  Brewing black tea and putting sugar in it still tastes kind of bitter with sugary sweetness flavor,
[13205.03s -> 13209.29s]  but getting an iced tea like a brisk or like a Lipton iced tea or something. They don't,
[13209.29s -> 13221.78s]  it tastes different. Is it just more sugar and just more lemon? I, green tea is my favorite
[13221.78s -> 13243.80s]  though for sure. I love green tea. You handle yourself pretty well. You sure you're just a
[13243.80s -> 13261.02s]  researcher? I'm just an average guy who... Give me the heal. I was like, where's my bass? I ate
[13261.02s -> 13265.90s]  that two hours ago. Did I tell you guys it just kind of reminded me? I was like, where is it? I
[13265.90s -> 13271.34s]  didn't, where's my bass? I want it. I was, what happened to my bass? Just unlocked a memory when
[13271.34s -> 13282.38s]  I was younger. I want to say when I was like, maybe like late teens, I want to say. I remember
[13282.38s -> 13287.10s]  I scratched a scratch ticket and one, I won a couple hundred dollars on a scratch ticket
[13287.66s -> 13293.19s]  when I was like, I don't know, maybe it had to have been like 19 or something. And I was like,
[13293.19s -> 13300.31s]  holy shit dude, fucking 300 bucks. And I kept looking for that money for like a year and later.
[13300.31s -> 13303.75s]  I was like, no, wait, I got money. Cause I, I won that scratch, I scratched off that fucking
[13303.75s -> 13312.30s]  300 bucks. I got money. And it was like, no, you don't, you don't. It's been spent. It was spent.
[13312.30s -> 13324.07s]  It's been like two years, dude. You didn't, the money's not there anymore. You spent it all on
[13324.07s -> 13354.25s]  Diablo too. I wasn't even looking and it scared me. I was reading chat. Oh shit. I forgot about
[13354.25s -> 13361.16s]  this. This is going to be awful. I forget this is, there's a strategy here. This is an unfair tag
[13361.16s -> 13426.60s]  team. I just, I'm dead, dude. I'm running around looting the fucking area. I get stomped. Pay
[13426.60s -> 13437.06s]  attention, dude. I get my head bitten off. Oh yeah. I have to do that because I just, I'll forget to
[13437.06s -> 13462.46s]  pick up this stuff. Let's go. What? Oh, dump them. Dump them. Dump them. Dump them. Dump them. Get
[13462.46s -> 13514.73s]  them to chase. Get them to chase. Over here. Get over here. Come over here. Luis, get him over,
[13514.73s -> 13585.70s]  come over this. What are you doing? Why does he keep moving? Oh, fuck you.
[13598.04s -> 13629.67s]  Luis, out of the way. All right, there's one. This one. Get, get off. Where you going? Where is he?
[13629.67s -> 13692.14s]  Where'd he go? That's a lot of dynamite, man. What do you want? Shoot it. Whoa. No, get off. Get off.
[13692.14s -> 13702.98s]  Get off. Get off. Get off. What am I doing? Shit. I was supposed to drop them. I, it was a stupid
[13702.98s -> 13718.87s]  indicator popped up on the screen. No, stop shooting him. Stop shooting him. Let him get
[13718.87s -> 13742.94s]  into the, stop shooting him. Let him get into the middle. No, he's getting out again. Stop shooting.
[13742.94s -> 13791.06s]  Stop shooting. Rip items. Rip items. I don't, I don't get anything for, well, here's the argument
[13791.06s -> 13800.92s]  I'm going to make to you. I probably would have gone through a bunch of this ammo, right? So,
[13800.92s -> 13816.97s]  technically I saved ammo, but I didn't get like 20, $30,000. Oh, well, it's all right. I actually
[13816.97s -> 13860.28s]  have a ton of ammo now. Is that everything? That's everything. That's fun. They only drop rubies.
[13861.00s -> 13868.49s]  That's kind of sad because I think I need a ruby. Purple gem. An amethyst doesn't drop from either
[13868.49s -> 13879.82s]  one of those two, right? Cause that would actually be bad. I would actually restart for that. It's
[13879.82s -> 13883.11s]  random.
[13902.07s -> 13938.86s]  Saying that sentence winded him. You just fought two giants. Yeah, an hour ago. Time moves much
[13938.86s -> 13944.06s]  differently in this game. I think we're, we're here for like six or seven days, aren't we? And
[13944.14s -> 13954.18s]  it's just kind of at each chapter is like another day. I'm making all of that up. You're not
[13954.18s -> 13990.92s]  suggesting we ride this thing. He hasn't pissed one time. Oh, you don't know that need a yellow herb.
[13990.92s -> 14012.58s]  Very bad. Let's go. Give us a push. What were you calling something on this? It's moving.
[14013.22s -> 14018.02s]  This should speed things up a bit. I can't believe I'm doing this. Hey, we're in a hurry, right?
[14019.42s -> 14036.06s]  By the way, what now? That was a little drop. Wasn't even scary. Oh, you have to lean.
[14037.19s -> 14074.81s]  Why is it going to flip? Why are we going so far off the rails? Dude, dude, shot the gun out of his
[14074.81s -> 14160.46s]  hand. Jesus, I'm on it. What was that guy doing? Why are we going so slow? Got it.
[14167.62s -> 14232.10s]  That was fun. That was pretty sick. Hold on. I hear like a, Whoa, watch this. Don't ever hold
[14232.10s -> 14236.10s]  your hand out like that. You should have, you should have been behind your back or something,
[14236.10s -> 14269.90s]  man. Eggs in here. Is that it? There's something else over here. Besides this,
[14269.90s -> 14281.78s]  there's something else, right? No, that way. Can I climb that? No. Very cool. I got all my
[14281.78s -> 14308.71s]  arrows back. All right. Cart ride part two. Play Donkey Kong music actually would be kind of funny.
[14308.71s -> 14329.58s]  I can't really all tap right now though. Do they die from that? Or is it? I don't know.
[14329.58s -> 14372.74s]  I just want to see. They really just throw you right in, huh? What the fuck? Are you shitting me?
[14379.90s -> 14382.86s]  I feel like that's another player playing Mario Kart or something.
[14424.87s -> 14461.62s]  Fuck. What's wrong with Luke? What's wrong with him? What's wrong with him?
[14461.62s -> 14528.39s]  Why is he just lifeless right now? We're good. That didn't work.
[14528.47s -> 14553.85s]  Kitchen Nightmares sounds, it really kind of works. Kitchen Nightmares.
[14557.46s -> 14580.49s]  That's so stupid. Wait a minute. There is a jewel over there. How do I get over there?
[14582.58s -> 14592.76s]  How do I get over there? Shit. Did I miss it? Maybe from here? Oh well. Maybe it's under me.
[14592.76s -> 14622.95s]  Shit. Did I miss it? Maybe from here? Oh well. Maybe it's under me.
[14625.29s -> 14645.32s]  I didn't even see it. I missed. You know what? It's the sound effect for me. It's just the loud
[14645.32s -> 14654.60s]  sound. Unexpected loud sound effects. Maybe I can get it. Wait a minute. What's down here?
[14654.60s -> 14690.14s]  I definitely can get it from here. That's what I'm looking for. Destroy all the entrances to the
[14690.14s -> 14697.58s]  hive. Too many have lost their lives in the never-ending swarm of insects. It's a plague.
[14697.58s -> 14730.42s]  Destroy the entrances to their gigantic hive. You got it. All right. Entrances. That's an entrance
[14730.42s -> 14747.61s]  right there. Is it not? Oh my god. No. Wait. Is it? That's it. Yeah, it is. That's it. Am I wasting
[14747.61s -> 14812.15s]  ammo right now? Get more. Oh, sapphire. All right. Do we need to jump up this? Can we not jump up
[14812.15s -> 14829.29s]  this together? Are you kidding me? What the duck is that? I don't know. Good question.
[14840.82s -> 14879.22s]  What? That's gone now, dude. All right. There's only one more right here. Hooray. Mission
[14879.22s -> 14889.38s]  accomplished. What happened to Ashley? It's a very, very good question. She was taken and then
[14890.90s -> 14895.16s]  I kind of lost track after I started doing the gumball machine over and over again.
[14895.24s -> 14924.58s]  But we'll be good. There is that over there. There's a gem or jewel over there somewhere.
[14925.22s -> 14937.30s]  That was not very good. I could do that better. There's all kinds of gems, jewels. That one's
[14937.30s -> 14957.88s]  better. Use that one. That's a weird place for that. I don't know why it's here. Maybe I have
[14957.88s -> 14974.38s]  to run back with a bunch of things attacking me. Yes. Can I destroy the hive? Why am I still getting
[14974.38s -> 15017.48s]  attacked? Oh, it's in here. Oh, you're welcome. Got a selection of good things on sale. I could
[15017.48s -> 15033.77s]  buy a bunch of these. I have learned how many sapphires I have. Holy shit. I'll do two blue
[15033.77s -> 15053.18s]  with the one green in here. Change clothes. I will in like six or seven days.
[15059.43s -> 15071.70s]  Your fools won't do you much good in the gray. Stranger, I'll pay a pretty penny for that.
[15071.70s -> 15081.70s]  Your weapons are in good hands, mate. I'll see you right. It doesn't get any better than that.
[15081.70s -> 15087.46s]  It's a veritable work of art, mate. Will that come back any time?
[15088.34s -> 15104.55s]  Now the quest to make a shitload of shotgun ammo begins. Okay, I want to make sure I have my
[15104.55s -> 15136.30s]  shotgun thing on. Gunpowder is the case that I have on. Go for it. Come on. Come on. 21. The quest
[15136.30s -> 15180.90s]  to get this to 50. Don't get yourself killed now. What can I interest you in?
[15183.77s -> 15188.49s]  Ruby's all rubbish. It makes no difference. Pleasure doing business with you.
[15189.77s -> 15205.22s]  Come back any time. You're wearing a Zoolander outfit. Dude, just wait until I put
[15206.86s -> 15213.67s]  48 rounds in this thing. I'm going to shoot 50 times in a row at the last boss and it's going
[15213.67s -> 15227.21s]  to be fucking hilarious. I'm going for the comedy run at this point. Let me kill this. Can I not
[15227.21s -> 15265.16s]  get up there? I don't think I can do it. Oh well. Oh well. Aren't you cheating at this game? I turn
[15265.16s -> 15274.78s]  unlimited ammo on when I have trouble. It's like half the game. Unlimited ammo invincibility
[15274.94s -> 15310.31s]  is turned on every few minutes or so. How'd he get the outfit? I paid an extra $10.
[15323.29s -> 15328.65s]  We made it all this way. You know it means we're almost... Almost what?
[15334.41s -> 15350.20s]  Luis! Long time no see, rookie. Major Krauser? What the hell? Why? Recovering stolen goods
[15352.73s -> 15363.93s]  and killing a few rats along the way. Easy work. Ashley, it was you. Catch on quick.
[15365.56s -> 15369.32s]  Didn't I teach you? Knives are faster.
[15371.64s -> 15375.56s]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. Oh yeah. You fast enough for that?
[15403.46s -> 15411.29s]  We are just getting started, rookie. Are you being controlled by that cult?
[15412.49s -> 15416.49s]  This has nothing to do with them. I'm a free man who made a choice.
[15416.49s -> 15439.32s]  Ow. Getting parried. Oh, you got parried five times in a row, man.
[15471.69s -> 15472.97s]  This is a fun fight with a parry.
[15504.73s -> 15509.82s]  Good day, my friend. And such a loss to the ladies of the world.
[15511.86s -> 15522.55s]  Don't talk. Take this. The key to my laboratory. Go there and remove those damn parasites.
[15530.02s -> 15541.94s]  No. I got it for you. I go, smoking is bad for you. Don't smoke. I don't do it.
[15541.94s -> 15554.62s]  I lead a pretty shitty life. But now, hey, what do you think Leon can change, right?
[15572.63s -> 15590.71s]  Shit. Crazy. A lot of points. Oh, the exclusive upgrade, right? Ooh,
[15590.71s -> 15598.39s]  parry all of Jack Prowzer's five consecutive attacks. That's pretty good, too.
[15599.03s -> 15608.33s]  I was wondering. I felt like I got those off pretty well.
[15623.19s -> 15821.66s]  I gotta pee again. I'll be right back. I'm back. Do you guys like that I do that now?
[15823.13s -> 15827.80s]  I give the little... That's not so crazy.
[15827.80s -> 15833.99s]  I like somebody said he saw the cigarette and needed to have a smoke break.
[15833.99s -> 15839.24s]  No, I just really had to pee. I drank a lot of water. Trying to stay hydrated.
[15839.24s -> 15860.57s]  Well, not a lot. That's not necessarily true.
[15860.57s -> 15862.97s]  You don't have to hide it. We know you want to cry.
[15868.47s -> 15882.31s]  What do you mean cry? Oh, because of... Oh, I see what you said.
[15882.31s -> 15911.64s]  Costume change? Yeah, I'll put here on. I just saved her, right? Give me a sec.
[15911.64s -> 15918.66s]  Well, might as well just try them all.
[15918.66s -> 15932.81s]  We haven't seen Ashley yet, so just make it normal. We had to see all the costumes.
[15932.81s -> 15938.34s]  Oh, hold on. You can't see. We gotta see them all.
[15938.34s -> 15955.42s]  It's not like we're not gonna do this. After we play this for like a chapter, I'll take it off.
[15955.42s -> 15960.98s]  We'll go back to the... Actually, I like this one. This one's actually good.
[15960.98s -> 15964.50s]  They're all good for different reasons. They're all fun.
[15964.50s -> 15974.06s]  All right, let's go. Sunglasses are going to be taken off.
[15974.06s -> 16001.90s]  I know. Shocking. No sound. Oh, shit. There you go.
[16001.90s -> 16018.98s]  Don't get away with this, Krauser. Geez. I feel like I should have a sword.
[16018.98s -> 16026.12s]  There's lots of... Actually, there... I gotta loot this whole area. This whole place.
[16033.06s -> 16044.54s]  There's one other herb over here, right? Okay.
[16044.54s -> 16048.79s]  You're a rogue with a crossbow and daggers. Actually, kind of true.
[16048.79s -> 16052.20s]  I do have a crossbow. That's right. I am playing the part.
[16067.08s -> 16070.10s]  Knight with a shotgun and a cell phone.
[16070.10s -> 16072.74s]  Leon, there's only time to say this once, so listen up.
[16072.74s -> 16078.97s]  They took your friend to... If you hurry, you might get there before she turns...
[16078.97s -> 16082.89s]  So you aren't heartless after all. I guess I should be thankful.
[16084.15s -> 16097.72s]  Turn on some fantasy music. What's jarring?
[16097.72s -> 16103.82s]  Someone helped me recover a stolen jewel snatched by a thieving crow.
[16104.46s -> 16110.73s]  I bet it can be found in the vile thing's nest. It's an heirloom. Okay.
[16117.27s -> 16119.83s]  Even the very sight of his image makes my skin crawl.
[16119.83s -> 16123.03s]  Do me a service and find some way to deface the portrait of him
[16123.59s -> 16126.07s]  in the room shown in the photograph, will you?
[16126.07s -> 16129.96s]  I'm not particular about how you do it. Hitting it with something might do the trick.
[16129.96s -> 16146.49s]  Where is that? Throne room?
[16146.81s -> 16165.19s]  That's your eye.
[16165.19s -> 16169.80s]  Leon looks like he's got lost on his way to a renaissance fair.
[16169.80s -> 16173.56s]  Welcome. Where would it? What can I do you for?
[16173.56s -> 16175.11s]  Still can't do anything.
[16175.11s -> 16177.59s]  Hmph. Suit yourself, stranger.
[16177.59s -> 16183.53s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Did I get everything over there?
[16184.33s -> 16186.49s]  Is there... Did I get everything over there?
[16187.05s -> 16192.50s]  There's the clock tower. Hang in there.
[16192.50s -> 16205.16s]  Shit. I'm going back. I look pissed.
[16205.80s -> 16224.10s]  Sorry, Ashley. There's items.
[16231.86s -> 16233.14s]  Okay. That was worth it.
[16233.78s -> 16238.34s]  You know what I kind of want to do?
[16241.02s -> 16249.03s]  Do you remember all the way back, like the very beginning of the game,
[16249.03s -> 16251.27s]  where the... Where's the village?
[16251.27s -> 16252.95s]  The actual village, village.
[16252.95s -> 16261.66s]  I'm kind of very far away from it, aren't I?
[16261.66s -> 16264.22s]  There's a couple of locked... It's gone.
[16264.22s -> 16268.66s]  Has it gone forever? It's locked off? Shit.
[16268.66s -> 16270.74s]  Because there's a couple of locked drawers
[16273.94s -> 16276.92s]  that are in the very beginning of the game.
[16276.92s -> 16279.32s]  And I was saying, oh, maybe I want to go back and get those.
[16279.96s -> 16284.71s]  There are locked drawers back in the beginning.
[16285.35s -> 16287.59s]  They probably just have gold bars in them, I'm assuming.
[16299.99s -> 16301.19s]  Check your drawers.
[16319.14s -> 16336.81s]  Okay. A lot of treasure in here.
[16336.81s -> 16338.97s]  All the side missions are back in the castle.
[16338.97s -> 16369.37s]  The painting one seems very easy, so why not?
[16369.37s -> 16373.27s]  Sorry, Ashley. I'm going... I'm going back again.
[16373.27s -> 16377.29s]  Sorry, Ashley. I keep having second thoughts.
[16378.01s -> 16382.81s]  I'll do the painting one. The night one is cool, too.
[16391.06s -> 16392.58s]  Don't skip the cigarette minigame.
[16413.35s -> 16415.35s]  Not down here. Oh, fuck. I was...
[16415.35s -> 16416.47s]  I just was on autopilot.
[16419.45s -> 16422.25s]  There's an achievement for riding back and forth?
[16428.92s -> 16432.84s]  I am really very indecisive ever since I put this fucking costume on.
[16432.84s -> 16447.88s]  All right. So where are these requests?
[16447.88s -> 16454.90s]  Jewel thief. I already did that.
[16454.90s -> 16458.57s]  Defeat the strong threat, the knight.
[16458.57s -> 16473.50s]  Maybe I'll do the knight and then this one, too.
[16473.50s -> 16476.87s]  I'll do the knight and I'll do the painting one.
[16476.87s -> 16483.29s]  Jewel thief takes like two minutes.
[16483.29s -> 16488.49s]  How come I rode down and immediately rode back up?
[16488.49s -> 16491.77s]  Well, that's because I was confused and I was not supposed to go down.
[16492.41s -> 16494.36s]  I was supposed to go that way.
[16495.16s -> 16498.20s]  Throne room one is a minute, too.
[16501.58s -> 16502.30s]  We go this way.
[16503.10s -> 16507.42s]  Can you stop being confused?
[16510.74s -> 16516.42s]  That's hard considering that's baked into my personality.
[16517.14s -> 16521.62s]  And I don't think there's ever going to be a time when I can stop that.
[16521.62s -> 16524.89s]  It's kind of who I am at this point.
[16524.89s -> 16526.65s]  So I think I have accepted that.
[16530.54s -> 16531.42s]  Understandable. Yeah.
[16536.65s -> 16538.01s]  All right. Where's the throne room?
[16540.76s -> 16542.60s]  Courtyard, wine cellar.
[16542.60s -> 16546.04s]  There's a lot of stuff here.
[16546.04s -> 16548.44s]  Oh, yeah. I mean, this is all going to get locked off.
[16548.44s -> 16549.80s]  So might as well just do a little bit.
[16549.80s -> 16557.51s]  I have keys, treasury.
[16558.07s -> 16565.11s]  So what's faster, taking the train back and going this way or just walking from here?
[16565.11s -> 16582.78s]  All right. Looking for locked drawers.
[16583.50s -> 16587.94s]  I know there's one or two over here.
[16587.94s -> 16596.39s]  Okay. It's the grand hall.
[16596.95s -> 16602.78s]  How did I not open this?
[16611.11s -> 16614.15s]  All right. Courtyard is this one in the courtyard.
[16614.15s -> 16623.29s]  Someone help me recover stolen jewel by thieving crow.
[16623.29s -> 16624.73s]  There's a nest in the courtyard.
[16626.46s -> 16627.98s]  I'm going to go to the courtyard first.
[16641.40s -> 16644.76s]  Got it. Is that right?
[16645.08s -> 16646.04s]  I just saw a huge bird.
[16646.68s -> 16661.27s]  All right. Nest.
[16661.27s -> 16663.99s]  There's apparently a nest here.
[16663.99s -> 16672.94s]  Bro, get away from me. What?
[16672.94s -> 16679.13s]  Oh, there it is.
[16685.75s -> 16692.20s]  All right. Scratched emerald.
[16692.20s -> 16692.92s]  That's that one.
[16694.10s -> 16695.38s]  The knight is in the mausoleum.
[16701.43s -> 16702.39s]  I failed that one.
[16702.39s -> 16705.46s]  All right. So this one, where is this one?
[16705.46s -> 16707.94s]  So mausoleum and then this weird throne room.
[16707.94s -> 16712.07s]  Audience chamber.
[16717.99s -> 16719.19s]  Audience chamber, right?
[16719.19s -> 16733.11s]  Ooh, far right.
[16733.11s -> 16739.02s]  It's over here.
[16739.02s -> 16741.13s]  Hold on. I'm curious about this.
[16741.13s -> 16745.13s]  A lot of shit over here.
[16745.13s -> 16750.42s]  Yeah, there's a lot of shit over here.
[16750.42s -> 16786.63s]  Okay. I want to check. I got to check.
[16786.63s -> 16789.35s]  This way is open now.
[16789.35s -> 16790.23s]  No, I need to.
[16790.87s -> 16804.26s]  No, there's a bunch of shit in here.
[16804.26s -> 16805.75s]  Let's go ahead and get it.
[16805.75s -> 16814.26s]  100k. 100,000.
[16814.26s -> 16860.76s]  It's already worth coming back here for the 100k.
[16860.76s -> 16868.14s]  Whoa. All right.
[16871.11s -> 16875.72s]  No, my bolt.
[16875.72s -> 16879.54s]  Game is freaking legit.
[16879.54s -> 16884.55s]  Yeah, it is.
[16884.55s -> 16885.35s]  Nice.
[16885.35s -> 16887.00s]  Extravagant clock.
[16887.00s -> 16897.19s]  What else is in here?
[16897.19s -> 16906.18s]  There it is. Nice.
[16906.18s -> 16906.98s]  Big money coming up.
[16911.94s -> 16914.10s]  The bolts are not real bolts.
[16914.10s -> 16914.98s]  It's in the wall.
[16914.98s -> 16916.26s]  Now down here.
[16916.26s -> 16921.51s]  Ooh, all right.
[16921.51s -> 16922.07s]  There's a bunch of...
[16922.07s -> 16923.19s]  I'm just going to go through this.
[16923.19s -> 16946.36s]  This game is busting.
[16946.36s -> 16947.64s]  Nobody said that.
[16947.64s -> 16948.20s]  Yeah, they did.
[16949.98s -> 16950.70s]  Why would I...
[16950.70s -> 16951.26s]  I just read it.
[16951.26s -> 16952.06s]  Somebody said it.
[16952.06s -> 16961.21s]  Is the knight down here?
[16961.21s -> 16966.86s]  I'm going to run into the knight, aren't I?
[16998.97s -> 16999.37s]  I'm good.
[17006.02s -> 17013.94s]  Now from here, I could go this way.
[17013.94s -> 17032.33s]  There's a treasure down here.
[17032.33s -> 17034.54s]  Let me just see where it is.
[17034.54s -> 17036.60s]  Is it up or down?
[17038.42s -> 17039.46s]  Locked chest or something, maybe?
[17044.14s -> 17055.54s]  All right.
[17055.54s -> 17055.78s]  It's...
[17057.42s -> 17060.86s]  He's totally baked doing side quests.
[17060.86s -> 17061.42s]  Huh?
[17061.42s -> 17089.91s]  Where's this treasure?
[17089.91s -> 17094.78s]  I should never come down here.
[17094.78s -> 17095.42s]  God damn it.
[17095.42s -> 17095.66s]  All right.
[17095.66s -> 17097.02s]  I need to go back or something
[17097.02s -> 17098.46s]  because there's like a treasure here,
[17098.46s -> 17113.58s]  but I'm just getting stuck.
[17113.58s -> 17114.46s]  What was that?
[17114.46s -> 17115.26s]  I shot you in the head.
[17115.90s -> 17148.38s]  Where do I go?
[17157.48s -> 17158.57s]  Okay.
[17158.57s -> 17159.45s]  Is that it?
[17159.45s -> 17162.23s]  I don't think so.
[17162.23s -> 17183.00s]  Try to get a suplex.
[17191.11s -> 17192.78s]  Got it.
[17192.78s -> 17197.03s]  Finally.
[17197.03s -> 17197.91s]  Get out of the way.
[17206.62s -> 17208.38s]  It's up on...
[17209.67s -> 17221.16s]  It's over here.
[17221.16s -> 17222.50s]  And then up.
[17222.50s -> 17227.54s]  What did that do?
[17264.63s -> 17265.67s]  He can't aim.
[17265.67s -> 17269.94s]  Yes, I can.
[17269.94s -> 17270.42s]  Nice.
[17270.42s -> 17271.78s]  Oh, it's worth it for sure.
[17287.19s -> 17292.73s]  Absolutely worth it.
[17292.73s -> 17293.96s]  Nice.
[17293.96s -> 17294.60s]  I hear...
[17294.60s -> 17295.24s]  Where is it?
[17295.24s -> 17316.95s]  I don't think I'm going to get them all,
[17316.95s -> 17325.72s]  but the germ of bussin'.
[17325.72s -> 17327.05s]  All right.
[17327.05s -> 17329.45s]  Now to make this...
[17331.54s -> 17332.82s]  I think I'm just going to take it.
[17332.82s -> 17335.10s]  I'm almost at max health.
[17335.10s -> 17337.48s]  Stop saying that.
[17337.48s -> 17341.94s]  I'm sorry.
[17341.94s -> 17344.12s]  I'm sorry.
[17344.12s -> 17349.69s]  I could probably take one more hit,
[17349.69s -> 17350.57s]  so maybe not.
[17350.57s -> 17352.01s]  All right.
[17352.01s -> 17352.73s]  Now here's a good question.
[17352.73s -> 17353.85s]  How do I get the hell out of here?
[17353.85s -> 17354.41s]  And where do I need...
[17354.41s -> 17355.61s]  What do I want to go from here?
[17355.61s -> 17372.04s]  This way, right?
[17372.04s -> 17379.58s]  Straight through here, right?
[17379.58s -> 17380.22s]  Maybe.
[17380.22s -> 17405.58s]  I haven't been this way.
[17405.58s -> 17406.06s]  All right.
[17406.06s -> 17406.94s]  Another treasure.
[17406.94s -> 17414.26s]  Oh, there's a gunpowder.
[17414.26s -> 17414.66s]  Nice.
[17414.66s -> 17433.96s]  This is a windy out.
[17433.96s -> 17435.72s]  What's going on here?
[17435.72s -> 17436.76s]  Is it windy?
[17436.76s -> 17448.98s]  This person has 100 million HP.
[17467.22s -> 17468.34s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[17468.34s -> 17469.46s]  I can't get that ammo back.
[17469.46s -> 17469.86s]  Why not?
[17470.42s -> 17479.34s]  Is that for real?
[17479.34s -> 17480.30s]  No, I can hit...
[17480.30s -> 17481.10s]  There's a thing, right?
[17481.10s -> 17482.49s]  I can shoot.
[17482.49s -> 17483.13s]  Usually there is.
[17487.06s -> 17487.62s]  Why would you...
[17487.62s -> 17488.02s]  Why would...
[17488.74s -> 17490.02s]  I can't get back up here now.
[17490.02s -> 17491.06s]  What are you doing?
[17491.06s -> 17504.33s]  What the hell is this thing?
[17519.61s -> 17519.93s]  Let's see.
[17519.93s -> 17520.57s]  Yeah.
[17520.57s -> 17527.21s]  It's a long way to go.
[17539.45s -> 17541.05s]  Oh, it's in there.
[17541.05s -> 17541.85s]  Okay, I know what to do.
[17547.26s -> 17549.42s]  They fall like the sims.
[17549.42s -> 17582.26s]  That is all the treasure here.
[17582.26s -> 17588.58s]  I should be able to get across, right?
[17588.58s -> 17600.95s]  This gets me all the way across.
[17600.95s -> 17603.61s]  And then back to here.
[17604.17s -> 17606.01s]  So where am I going now?
[17606.01s -> 17607.45s]  Where's the mausoleum?
[17607.45s -> 17614.90s]  Should I go across here and just up?
[17615.54s -> 17617.22s]  I can't make it across this, right?
[17617.22s -> 17619.72s]  It's a place where you were with Ashley.
[17625.62s -> 17626.42s]  Get the bolts.
[17626.42s -> 17627.22s]  Can I?
[17627.22s -> 17631.24s]  I don't think I can go up.
[17631.24s -> 17635.40s]  Could I have gone up?
[17635.40s -> 17636.20s]  Just didn't see it.
[17636.20s -> 17636.76s]  Okay, I can.
[17641.21s -> 17641.61s]  Thank you.
[17660.42s -> 17672.78s]  Uh, I think they actually are gone.
[17680.57s -> 17681.21s]  Shit.
[17681.21s -> 17687.74s]  I don't see one of those balls to drop either.
[17687.74s -> 17693.88s]  That's unfortunate.
[17693.88s -> 17696.36s]  I'm glad it took 12 arrows to kill that person.
[17696.36s -> 17717.69s]  Repeat that again.
[17717.69s -> 17726.89s]  You dropped the thing.
[17726.89s -> 17730.07s]  Fucked.
[17730.07s -> 17733.53s]  All right, we're back in here now.
[17733.53s -> 17737.03s]  Courtyard.
[17737.03s -> 17744.60s]  So from the courtyard, I need to go here, you're saying, right?
[17744.60s -> 17746.04s]  Down here in the wine cellar?
[17746.04s -> 17747.72s]  Is that correct?
[17747.72s -> 17771.90s]  I cleared all this from the three-headed mirror room.
[17771.90s -> 17775.82s]  So in here.
[17775.82s -> 17778.87s]  I don't even remember where the hell that was.
[17778.87s -> 17780.71s]  Oh, throne room is right here.
[17780.71s -> 17781.75s]  All right, hold on.
[17781.75s -> 17786.95s]  It was great.
[17786.95s -> 17787.51s]  It was right here.
[17787.51s -> 17788.47s]  It's the grand hall.
[17788.47s -> 17791.43s]  So grand hall to...
[17792.15s -> 17798.73s]  Can I get in this door now?
[17798.73s -> 17802.65s]  Oh, some rare things for sale.
[17802.65s -> 17820.68s]  It's the fastest way to get back there.
[17820.68s -> 17830.60s]  I got thrown to the courtyard.
[17830.60s -> 17846.71s]  Ah, I'm gonna go turn this in.
[17859.40s -> 17859.88s]  Thank you.
[17862.12s -> 17863.08s]  All right, how are we doing?
[17863.08s -> 17863.72s]  I have...
[17864.52s -> 17869.64s]  Let's go ahead and get that one hundred thousand dollars.
[17871.85s -> 17876.97s]  Boom.
[17876.97s -> 17878.41s]  Also, I can do this.
[17880.90s -> 17881.54s]  Sell this too.
[17883.06s -> 17883.46s]  Green.
[17885.14s -> 17886.82s]  And blue is the most expensive, right?
[17887.56s -> 17898.36s]  Or is it yellow?
[17898.36s -> 17898.68s]  Cool.
[17899.32s -> 17901.16s]  And then this one is still hanging around.
[17903.16s -> 17904.66s]  100k.
[17905.48s -> 17907.80s]  One hundred and twenty three thousand dollars.
[17911.08s -> 17911.56s]  Hell yeah.
[17919.90s -> 17961.26s]  I'm just gonna get rid of the laser sight.
[17961.98s -> 17965.69s]  Yeah, what's the point of having this?
[17966.49s -> 17967.93s]  I'm not gonna use it for anything.
[17967.93s -> 17969.61s]  I'm not using any of these weapons.
[17972.30s -> 17974.01s]  Let's max this thing out.
[17977.13s -> 17980.41s]  A hundred thousand to make this thing disgusting.
[17981.37s -> 17981.61s]  Or...
[17991.45s -> 17992.09s]  You get the ticket.
[17996.65s -> 17997.37s]  I can get the ticket.
[17998.17s -> 17999.05s]  I think that's the play.
[18002.76s -> 18004.36s]  I'll get that after beating the knight.
[18005.32s -> 18012.44s]  I need to make some herbs here.
[18020.23s -> 18022.33s]  Wait, I already...
[18022.33s -> 18028.62s]  Wait, what's going on?
[18028.62s -> 18030.30s]  What if I had a yellow?
[18031.02s -> 18039.35s]  I don't.
[18039.35s -> 18045.75s]  Give me the proc.
[18045.75s -> 18047.91s]  There's 30 shots in this.
[18047.91s -> 18048.63s]  Oh my god.
[18051.56s -> 18052.36s]  30.
[18052.36s -> 18053.40s]  We're getting there.
[18053.40s -> 18064.18s]  What about the broken butterfly?
[18064.18s -> 18065.54s]  Do the ticket on the broken butterfly?
[18067.62s -> 18070.50s]  I don't know if I'm gonna have enough money to upgrade the broken butterfly.
[18071.46s -> 18072.98s]  Maybe much later in the game.
[18073.54s -> 18075.93s]  All right, so we need to go this way.
[18075.93s -> 18088.74s]  I need to go right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right,
[18089.30s -> 18118.94s]  and go right, right, right, okay, and straight.
[18118.94s -> 18128.81s]  Let's go.
[18131.10s -> 18132.22s]  Good luck.
[18132.22s -> 18145.46s]  These side quests are really, really fun.
[18147.54s -> 18150.50s]  It makes backtracking way more interesting.
[18150.50s -> 18165.54s]  Hey, hope all is well.
[18165.54s -> 18167.06s]  Hey, right back.
[18167.06s -> 18167.86s]  Right back at you.
[18173.51s -> 18174.55s]  That's the knight.
[18174.55s -> 18176.31s]  The golden knight.
[18176.31s -> 18199.74s]  I'm loading a fucking bomb on this thing.
[18199.74s -> 18200.24s]  Whoa.
[18211.35s -> 18212.79s]  Yeah, another one.
[18236.12s -> 18238.34s]  Oh, shit.
[18238.34s -> 18253.46s]  That hurt.
[18253.46s -> 18254.42s]  Pop it.
[18254.42s -> 18255.06s]  What's going on?
[18257.35s -> 18257.83s]  Blow up.
[18257.83s -> 18259.11s]  Why is it not blowing up?
[18259.11s -> 18260.25s]  What's going on?
[18263.67s -> 18264.63s]  It's on the ground.
[18275.77s -> 18276.27s]  Die.
[18291.64s -> 18292.04s]  Wow.
[18292.60s -> 18296.97s]  Jeez.
[18296.97s -> 18301.53s]  What do you get?
[18301.53s -> 18303.77s]  You get all three colors.
[18303.77s -> 18307.19s]  Stop yelling.
[18307.19s -> 18313.67s]  You're gonna wake my parents up.
[18313.67s -> 18314.31s]  Very cool.
[18314.31s -> 18316.23s]  All right, so that was really cool.
[18316.23s -> 18316.71s]  That was fun.
[18316.71s -> 18318.15s]  I like these little mini bosses.
[18318.15s -> 18319.91s]  That's so, what a cool addition.
[18319.91s -> 18324.44s]  Found a use for those.
[18329.53s -> 18330.81s]  The mines I think carried.
[18330.81s -> 18331.93s]  This thing is so good.
[18331.93s -> 18333.61s]  I talked way too much shit about this.
[18337.10s -> 18339.50s]  This new weapon, the bolt, crossbow thing.
[18342.04s -> 18343.32s]  Is really good.
[18343.32s -> 18344.04s]  It's really good.
[18344.60s -> 18346.23s]  I talked a lot of shit about it.
[18350.22s -> 18356.28s]  Nearly infinite ammo and has bombs on it.
[18356.28s -> 18357.72s]  Did I lose the arrows?
[18357.72s -> 18359.48s]  Did I shoot them into the ceiling or something?
[18359.48s -> 18361.96s]  I think I did.
[18376.57s -> 18379.00s]  Rock.
[18379.00s -> 18380.26s]  Finally.
[18380.26s -> 18391.50s]  There we go.
[18391.50s -> 18406.46s]  That's so, I can't wait to shoot this like 30, 40 times in a row.
[18406.46s -> 18408.92s]  Now the throne room and that's it.
[18408.92s -> 18410.76s]  We've done pretty much all the side things in the castle.
[18413.11s -> 18414.39s]  And then we're in the end game, Peter.
[18414.39s -> 18438.20s]  I just need to go out through here.
[18438.20s -> 18443.24s]  So straight, right, straight, straight.
[18443.24s -> 18469.53s]  Straight, right, straight, straight.
[18469.53s -> 18470.25s]  Again.
[18470.25s -> 18472.50s]  Did I unlock this door?
[18472.50s -> 18473.62s]  I hope I did.
[18473.62s -> 18474.98s]  Yeah, I did.
[18474.98s -> 18484.02s]  And then it's straight again.
[18484.02s -> 18484.66s]  What?
[18484.66s -> 18488.23s]  Oh, right, right, right.
[18488.23s -> 18488.79s]  It's fine.
[18488.79s -> 18498.92s]  Got everything here, right?
[18498.92s -> 18499.64s]  Yes.
[18499.64s -> 18502.92s]  Throne room time.
[18502.92s -> 18516.65s]  Did I, I left this place in a pretty sorry state, huh?
[18516.65s -> 18521.13s]  Oh my God.
[18536.07s -> 18537.11s]  Jesus.
[18537.11s -> 18538.28s]  Stop.
[18538.28s -> 18543.48s]  Stop running.
[18543.48s -> 18545.08s]  Oh my goodness.
[18545.08s -> 18555.16s]  Spurs don't even have a head.
[18559.26s -> 18564.68s]  Yeah, man.
[18565.24s -> 18580.71s]  I didn't have a head.
[18580.79s -> 18582.30s]  And he was still running at me.
[18582.30s -> 18607.30s]  I'm a mess.
[18607.30s -> 18608.66s]  Is something scary in here?
[18608.66s -> 18623.72s]  We're eight years since my awakening.
[18623.72s -> 18628.60s]  Alas, my noble pursuit progresses to its final stage, the fusion of human and insect.
[18628.60s -> 18632.09s]  The housekeeper has graciously volunteered herself for the experiment.
[18632.09s -> 18637.42s]  I shall pour my whole heart into this endeavor in order to transcend humanity and make
[18637.42s -> 18640.38s]  Master Ramon proud.
[18640.38s -> 18641.98s]  March, nine years since my awakening.
[18641.98s -> 18645.10s]  A glorious union has been made.
[18645.10s -> 18647.67s]  The housekeeper has endured much suffering.
[18647.67s -> 18648.86s]  Not for naught.
[18648.86s -> 18651.82s]  Behold, the fruits of our labor and all of its beauty.
[18651.82s -> 18657.26s]  I shall consecrate this perfect life form with the name U3, where three is the most
[18657.26s -> 18658.78s]  beautiful and complete number.
[18658.78s -> 18663.48s]  I think ten is.
[18663.48s -> 18670.44s]  I think ten is like a complete number.
[18670.44s -> 18672.04s]  April, nine years since my awakening.
[18672.04s -> 18678.87s]  U3, my dear hound, Pezenta, has been chosen to serve as the right hand of Master Ramon.
[18678.87s -> 18681.48s]  But is two not better than one?
[18681.48s -> 18684.04s]  Now it is my turn to demonstrate my loyalty.
[18684.04s -> 18688.36s]  His humble servant, Isidro Girarte Talavera.
[18688.36s -> 18692.71s]  The best things come in threes.
[18695.22s -> 18696.10s]  Like, one hundred, though.
[18698.46s -> 18700.52s]  Denominations of one hundred?
[18700.52s -> 18703.08s]  Like, one hundred, I think, is a complete number.
[18705.66s -> 18713.24s]  Ten, ten, one hundred, one thousand, ten thousand, one million, ten million, a hundred million.
[18721.91s -> 18723.03s]  There are treasures here.
[18723.59s -> 18728.28s]  Why are there chickens everywhere?
[18728.28s -> 18730.55s]  How do I make them lay eggs?
[18730.55s -> 18732.39s]  Why are there chickens in here?
[18732.39s -> 18744.18s]  Why are they in here?
[18744.18s -> 18748.58s]  Oh, Master Ramon, with tomorrow's procedure, I shall finally surpass the limitations of
[18748.58s -> 18749.70s]  this mortal shell.
[18750.10s -> 18753.06s]  What's left of me now shall be gone soon.
[18753.06s -> 18755.06s]  Magnificent, the holy body is a wondrous miracle.
[18755.62s -> 18759.78s]  The fealty I've sworn to Master Ramon is the sole light that illuminates my path.
[18759.78s -> 18763.50s]  Our fates shall be entwined until the very end.
[18763.50s -> 18765.02s]  Have you ever known such loyalty?
[18768.68s -> 18783.93s]  That's a golden egg.
[18783.93s -> 18785.37s]  I'll be taking this.
[18785.37s -> 18807.24s]  I'll be taking that one.
[18807.24s -> 18810.44s]  Cool.
[18810.44s -> 18814.34s]  Now the painting.
[18814.34s -> 18816.66s]  I feel like my hair looks like that sometimes.
[18816.66s -> 18817.46s]  Where's the painting?
[18818.02s -> 18832.31s]  Are you laying eggs?
[18832.31s -> 18833.75s]  Where's the paint?
[18833.75s -> 18834.55s]  What am I looking for?
[18835.03s -> 18845.27s]  Got that one.
[18845.27s -> 18846.52s]  Got that one.
[18846.52s -> 18852.70s]  To face Ramon's portrait.
[18855.42s -> 18856.30s]  Oh, it's just...
[18856.30s -> 18857.26s]  Okay, I thought it was a dream.
[18857.26s -> 18858.06s]  So just destroy it.
[18858.06s -> 18859.58s]  Okay, I can do that.
[18859.58s -> 18863.53s]  That didn't work.
[18863.53s -> 18874.73s]  I need an egg?
[18875.94s -> 18877.22s]  Throw an egg at it.
[18877.22s -> 18883.18s]  That's a golden egg.
[18885.78s -> 18886.26s]  How do I...
[18886.26s -> 18887.30s]  I don't want to throw the golden egg.
[18890.20s -> 18890.92s]  Give me an egg.
[18895.38s -> 18900.04s]  Egg?
[18900.04s -> 18901.08s]  Just wait for the chickens.
[18901.08s -> 18936.58s]  Don't chase them.
[18936.58s -> 18937.62s]  There actually is.
[18937.62s -> 18945.69s]  I'm dressed in the right outfit too.
[18945.69s -> 18947.05s]  Elden Lord.
[18947.05s -> 18961.96s]  I need an egg.
[18965.18s -> 18980.09s]  Is this the right guy?
[18988.10s -> 18990.28s]  Lay an egg already.
[18990.28s -> 18991.00s]  I have an egg.
[18991.00s -> 18992.44s]  I don't want to throw a golden egg.
[18992.44s -> 18994.36s]  This thing is worth a lot of money.
[18994.36s -> 18997.46s]  It's worth like 10 grand.
[18997.46s -> 18998.58s]  Lay an egg yourself.
[18998.58s -> 19021.86s]  I'm just going to sit right here.
[19021.86s -> 19022.76s]  I'm not going to bother them.
[19022.76s -> 19035.64s]  I'm going to let them do their thing.
[19035.64s -> 19037.14s]  Shoot one?
[19037.14s -> 19038.58s]  No, I don't want to shoot one.
[19038.58s -> 19057.13s]  Shoot the air scare them.
[19057.13s -> 19058.09s]  They'll drop one.
[19058.09s -> 19075.40s]  This chicken does not give a shit.
[19080.42s -> 19081.30s]  They don't care.
[19081.30s -> 19094.86s]  The chicken?
[19094.86s -> 19095.50s]  You can't.
[19095.50s -> 19101.86s]  I feel like an egg is supposed to drop here,
[19101.86s -> 19106.33s]  but the game does not want to give me one.
[19106.33s -> 19108.33s]  Very clearly this chicken's in this room
[19108.33s -> 19112.44s]  because we're supposed to shoot it.
[19112.44s -> 19113.08s]  I don't...
[19113.08s -> 19114.84s]  What if I shoot it and shoot it?
[19114.84s -> 19118.58s]  They gave you one.
[19118.58s -> 19121.06s]  No, I had to get the puzzle box to get one.
[19143.22s -> 19144.50s]  You can actually even...
[19144.50s -> 19145.06s]  That's funny.
[19145.06s -> 19147.54s]  You can do that.
[19147.54s -> 19151.34s]  You can throw eggs at people.
[19151.34s -> 19154.20s]  Just wait until a few weeks go by
[19154.20s -> 19156.36s]  and somebody does a egg percent.
[19156.36s -> 19158.87s]  Or they just farm eggs, fill their inventory,
[19158.87s -> 19161.11s]  put on all the egg charms
[19161.11s -> 19163.59s]  and kill the last boss with eggs.
[19163.59s -> 19165.19s]  This is going to happen.
[19165.19s -> 19170.06s]  All right.
[19170.06s -> 19171.10s]  Thank you for the eggs.
[19171.10s -> 19172.22s]  I appreciate it.
[19172.54s -> 19174.78s]  Have a nice...
[19174.78s -> 19177.11s]  Get another one.
[19177.11s -> 19177.75s]  I got a better idea.
[19177.75s -> 19178.87s]  I'm just going to fucking...
[19178.87s -> 19202.06s]  I have a charm that heals me 100%.
[19202.06s -> 19203.19s]  Two is enough.
[19203.19s -> 19203.83s]  Two is enough.
[19203.83s -> 19204.95s]  You've worked...
[19204.95s -> 19205.51s]  You've done...
[19205.51s -> 19207.40s]  Good job.
[19207.40s -> 19208.44s]  Two is enough.
[19208.44s -> 19210.10s]  Three would be great.
[19210.10s -> 19210.74s]  Two is enough.
[19211.30s -> 19212.90s]  Three would be great.
[19212.90s -> 19215.78s]  Two is enough, though.
[19215.78s -> 19217.11s]  Two is enough.
[19217.11s -> 19219.03s]  Three would be fantastic.
[19219.03s -> 19219.83s]  Two is enough.
[19219.83s -> 19225.30s]  There you go.
[19225.30s -> 19226.57s]  All right.
[19226.57s -> 19232.70s]  I wish you very long chicken lives.
[19232.70s -> 19242.78s]  Good day.
[19242.78s -> 19245.40s]  Very nice.
[19245.40s -> 19247.48s]  So turn in
[19247.48s -> 19256.06s]  and then we're going to make our way that way.
[19256.06s -> 19256.78s]  Back to where we were.
[19257.42s -> 19268.79s]  Whatever.
[19268.79s -> 19269.99s]  I got work at 6 a.m.
[19269.99s -> 19270.55s]  Speed it up.
[19272.12s -> 19274.17s]  I can assure you
[19274.73s -> 19277.70s]  that I am at least...
[19277.70s -> 19278.34s]  At least
[19279.30s -> 19281.38s]  6 to 10 hours away from completing this game.
[19282.92s -> 19283.16s]  At...
[19283.96s -> 19284.60s]  At minimum.
[19291.27s -> 19292.95s]  Are you seriously going to do that right now?
[19296.82s -> 19298.58s]  You're not going to actually make me take this
[19303.50s -> 19304.30s]  bunch of shit.
[19304.30s -> 19305.74s]  I can't believe I actually had to do that.
[19306.38s -> 19329.59s]  Let me just go turn these in.
[19330.54s -> 19331.98s]  I'm going to upgrade this.
[19332.54s -> 19333.02s]  No, I'm not.
[19333.02s -> 19334.30s]  I'm going to get the ticket at least.
[19339.50s -> 19340.38s]  Eight spinals.
[19341.26s -> 19342.06s]  Four spinals.
[19343.75s -> 19344.07s]  All right.
[19344.07s -> 19345.03s]  I'm going to buy one of these.
[19345.99s -> 19346.95s]  So now I have it.
[19349.83s -> 19350.23s]  And then...
[19352.23s -> 19353.11s]  Wait a minute here.
[19361.00s -> 19362.68s]  Oh, yeah.
[19363.24s -> 19368.10s]  The ticket is pointless.
[19369.08s -> 19372.36s]  The ticket is not pointless because
[19373.32s -> 19378.04s]  I don't want to spend $100,000 on this.
[19382.06s -> 19385.58s]  Essentially, the ticket is worth $100,000.
[19386.14s -> 19390.23s]  So if I plan on upgrading this at all anymore
[19390.23s -> 19392.15s]  or the magnum,
[19392.79s -> 19395.66s]  that's $100,000 that I can actually upgrade a third weapon with.
[19396.30s -> 19400.84s]  So it's worth it, especially for the expensive stuff.
[19401.56s -> 19404.06s]  Essentially trading this for $100,000.
[19409.29s -> 19410.89s]  Okay.
[19410.89s -> 19413.58s]  Okay.
[19413.58s -> 19414.14s]  Very nice.
[19418.44s -> 19419.64s]  Let's continue.
[19420.28s -> 19423.46s]  Next place I'm going is just progress,
[19424.18s -> 19427.53s]  which is this way, right?
[19431.70s -> 19432.10s]  Yeah.
[19434.33s -> 19434.65s]  Yes.
[19435.21s -> 19437.37s]  Because I had to ride the trolley.
[19437.37s -> 19437.69s]  Okay.
[19438.25s -> 19439.78s]  Hang a right.
[19439.78s -> 19441.18s]  Hang a right.
[19441.18s -> 19442.31s]  Straight.
[19442.31s -> 19455.16s]  Upgrade.
[19455.16s -> 19456.49s]  You didn't use it.
[19456.49s -> 19457.21s]  Use the ticket.
[19457.21s -> 19457.69s]  What?
[19457.69s -> 19461.69s]  No, no, no.
[19461.69s -> 19462.49s]  I don't want to.
[19462.49s -> 19462.89s]  Not yet.
[19464.70s -> 19465.10s]  Not yet.
[19465.66s -> 19469.88s]  Oh, I walked in a circle.
[19470.52s -> 19471.88s]  Not yet because I want to know
[19472.60s -> 19473.88s]  if I upgrade the other stuff,
[19473.88s -> 19475.56s]  I want to make sure I have a ticket.
[19475.56s -> 19477.58s]  It's called hoarding.
[19480.44s -> 19481.48s]  I haven't made a decision.
[19481.48s -> 19483.80s]  What if I want to use the ticket on the revolver?
[19483.80s -> 19486.04s]  What if I want to use the ticket on the bolt gun?
[19486.04s -> 19488.84s]  You know what I mean?
[19488.84s -> 19490.44s]  It's called hoarding and it's called
[19490.44s -> 19493.64s]  having remorse for selling or whatever it is.
[19494.20s -> 19495.77s]  That makes no sense.
[19495.77s -> 19496.49s]  Yes, it does.
[19496.49s -> 19499.91s]  What do you mean?
[19499.91s -> 19503.54s]  Then it wouldn't be worth $100,000.
[19503.54s -> 19512.10s]  The tickets do not require it to be fully upgraded.
[19512.10s -> 19519.56s]  What do you mean?
[19519.56s -> 19521.72s]  No, you fully upgrade everything.
[19521.72s -> 19525.29s]  Spend $60,000 on the bolt gun.
[19525.29s -> 19526.57s]  I don't have $60,000.
[19526.57s -> 19527.72s]  I'm just going to hold it.
[19528.28s -> 19529.48s]  I'm going to hold.
[19529.48s -> 19530.28s]  I'm holding it.
[19531.64s -> 19533.80s]  You can use the ticket on any weapon without upgrading it.
[19536.66s -> 19536.98s]  What?
[19538.06s -> 19541.54s]  I thought it was either spend money or the ticket.
[19541.54s -> 19542.02s]  Hold on.
[19542.02s -> 19542.98s]  I'm confused now.
[19543.46s -> 19544.26s]  Now I got hit.
[19562.46s -> 19565.66s]  Just let me get back up here so I'm not as confused.
[19565.66s -> 19566.22s]  Give me a second.
[19571.90s -> 19573.58s]  Where the hell am I going?
[19573.58s -> 19579.26s]  Is it down and then?
[19579.26s -> 19580.30s]  Wait, where am I going here?
[19580.30s -> 19581.18s]  What the fuck is happening?
[19593.11s -> 19594.07s]  Why is that closed?
[19595.19s -> 19595.91s]  Where am I going?
[19596.55s -> 19604.30s]  Bro, where am I going right now?
[19604.30s -> 19605.90s]  Where am I going right now?
[19606.86s -> 19607.90s]  I'm like running back to the...
[19608.54s -> 19613.50s]  This room sucks.
[19615.32s -> 19616.76s]  They just never-endingly spawn.
[19617.32s -> 19622.71s]  Bro, where am I going?
[19636.12s -> 19636.36s]  All right.
[19636.36s -> 19637.48s]  Let me look at this one more time.
[19637.48s -> 19639.56s]  Welcome.
[19639.56s -> 19640.76s]  What can I do you?
[19640.76s -> 19648.41s]  You have a ticket, do you?
[19648.41s -> 19650.57s]  Choose a weapon, stranger.
[19650.57s -> 19654.23s]  And I'll make it seem.
[19654.23s -> 19655.75s]  So I don't have...
[19657.03s -> 19658.79s]  This will upgrade the whole thing.
[19659.35s -> 19662.25s]  Knife needs care, everyone.
[19662.25s -> 19664.33s]  So this will max the whole weapon out is what you're saying.
[19665.21s -> 19669.14s]  No, it only gives the exclusive.
[19669.70s -> 19672.60s]  So then what's the problem then?
[19673.24s -> 19683.74s]  There is no problem.
[19683.74s -> 19686.34s]  You don't need to max it out to get the exclusive.
[19687.91s -> 19690.15s]  Oh, okay.
[19690.15s -> 19692.07s]  Okay, I say sorry.
[19692.07s -> 19693.27s]  There's like music in my ears.
[19695.00s -> 19695.88s]  So it just...
[19696.76s -> 19698.28s]  You don't have to upgrade it all the way.
[19698.28s -> 19698.76s]  I get it.
[19698.76s -> 19699.40s]  But I don't...
[19699.40s -> 19703.10s]  Do I want to use this on the revolver?
[19703.10s -> 19704.86s]  There's three weapons that I want to get to max.
[19705.42s -> 19707.18s]  And I don't know what two of them there are.
[19708.84s -> 19709.80s]  There's this one.
[19709.80s -> 19710.44s]  There's this one.
[19710.44s -> 19711.32s]  And then there's a revolver.
[19713.53s -> 19714.01s]  I don't know.
[19714.01s -> 19716.49s]  Because I've got to figure out which one I want to do that to.
[19717.21s -> 19722.82s]  Do I want to do it to the bolt gun and the revolver?
[19722.82s -> 19725.14s]  Or the handgun and the revolver?
[19725.14s -> 19726.26s]  Or the handgun and the bolt gun?
[19726.90s -> 19732.39s]  This is the most logical decision.
[19733.96s -> 19735.16s]  So I guess we'll do this one.
[19739.78s -> 19742.50s]  But this thing is now amazing.
[19745.11s -> 19751.90s]  So now I'm going to focus all of my money into the revolver, I think.
[19751.90s -> 19756.30s]  If you want a fighting chance out there, you best tune up your kit.
[19757.10s -> 19764.52s]  Well, the magnum.
[19764.52s -> 19765.02s]  Whatever.
[19767.48s -> 19769.96s]  I should be able to do it to three of them.
[19770.60s -> 19779.56s]  Why is the third save point gone?
[19779.56s -> 19781.59s]  That's freaking me out.
[19781.59s -> 19784.07s]  All right.
[19784.07s -> 19786.87s]  I am ready to go and I want to make sure I get this the right way.
[19786.87s -> 19787.91s]  So it's...
[19787.91s -> 19789.62s]  How did I fuck this up?
[19790.18s -> 19793.85s]  It's out here, to the right, to the...
[19793.85s -> 19794.49s]  Okay.
[19794.49s -> 19795.61s]  Is it from the ballroom?
[19796.25s -> 19801.69s]  The autosave was the third...
[19801.69s -> 19802.49s]  Oh, okay.
[19802.49s -> 19805.51s]  It's north of the bug room.
[19805.51s -> 19808.25s]  I feel like I was going that way.
[19808.81s -> 19813.32s]  You were actually going the right direction.
[19813.32s -> 19813.96s]  Oh, shit.
[19813.96s -> 19814.68s]  I just freaked out.
[19815.48s -> 19820.18s]  So it's in the bug room, left.
[19820.18s -> 19829.14s]  Just don't go up the stairs.
[19840.01s -> 19840.57s]  All right.
[19840.57s -> 19842.17s]  You know, I thought this was blocked off.
[19842.17s -> 19842.89s]  That was my problem.
[19854.22s -> 19855.50s]  I thought it was blocked off.
[19855.50s -> 19856.06s]  All right.
[19856.06s -> 19857.58s]  Time to actually get game progress.
[19858.30s -> 19862.41s]  Probably not going to stream for that much longer.
[19862.41s -> 19864.81s]  Maybe to the end of this chapter, I would say.
[19865.53s -> 19866.25s]  Maybe the boss.
[19866.25s -> 19867.61s]  I think we're getting close to the boss.
[19868.25s -> 19879.58s]  Straight up here.
[19881.74s -> 19882.38s]  All right, Ashley.
[19882.38s -> 19883.10s]  I'm finally here.
[19883.90s -> 19884.22s]  Sorry.
[19884.22s -> 19886.46s]  I had to communicate with a bunch of people on upgrades.
[19912.94s -> 19914.06s]  You wish.
[19914.06s -> 19916.28s]  At the top of the tower.
[19933.08s -> 19933.88s]  Oh, it makes sure...
[19933.88s -> 19934.84s]  No one to run.
[19934.84s -> 19943.50s]  I wanted to suplex the guy
[19943.50s -> 19944.94s]  because everybody was yelling at me to do it.
[19945.58s -> 19966.25s]  Cool.
[19966.25s -> 19966.81s]  All right.
[19966.81s -> 20000.06s]  I am almost out of ammo.
[20000.06s -> 20001.34s]  God, I like this gun.
[20001.34s -> 20002.62s]  I picked wrong.
[20002.62s -> 20004.89s]  I have Settler's Remorse.
[20004.89s -> 20006.65s]  Fire's Remorse.
[20006.65s -> 20007.77s]  I should have upgraded this all the way.
[20013.00s -> 20014.28s]  I'm just going to restart the whole game.
[20063.93s -> 20064.25s]  Free!
[20064.89s -> 20091.06s]  Probably a treasure from that.
[20092.55s -> 20095.37s]  There's a treasure from that, right?
[20095.37s -> 20095.93s]  Right?
[20095.93s -> 20117.94s]  I don't want to miss everything.
[20120.65s -> 20120.89s]  Nice.
[20121.53s -> 20123.69s]  There's a lot of stuff in here.
[20124.41s -> 20137.18s]  There's a lot of stuff in here.
[20137.18s -> 20137.74s]  Right?
[20137.74s -> 20156.52s]  It's 10k right there.
[20156.52s -> 20157.08s]  Simple.
[20157.08s -> 20157.64s]  Easy.
[20157.64s -> 20168.94s]  I guess that big statue does not drop anything.
[20182.44s -> 20184.60s]  I know I'm being map Andy right now,
[20184.60s -> 20185.88s]  but I just want to...
[20185.88s -> 20197.18s]  You got to check it every so often.
[20197.18s -> 20210.18s]  No.
[20210.18s -> 20210.50s]  God.
[20226.18s -> 20231.03s]  Where's the ball?
[20232.41s -> 20233.53s]  That's a slow ball.
[20236.68s -> 20237.56s]  You're going to make it, aren't you?
[20239.58s -> 20240.54s]  You got to be kidding me.
[20240.54s -> 20242.14s]  You actually made that?
[20242.14s -> 20243.66s]  That's impressive, but fuck you.
[20244.54s -> 20286.26s]  Am I safe here?
[20286.26s -> 20287.06s]  Damn it.
[20287.06s -> 20294.89s]  All right.
[20294.89s -> 20297.30s]  There is a treasure somewhere here.
[20360.73s -> 20361.77s]  Looney Tunes.
[20361.77s -> 20366.95s]  This weapon is so much better now.
[20366.95s -> 20368.23s]  I'm glad I listened to you guys.
[20368.23s -> 20372.70s]  I like the bolt gun, but you know, it's okay.
[20372.70s -> 20373.18s]  It's all good.
[20379.56s -> 20392.54s]  Here's one.
[20393.26s -> 20398.92s]  Mirror with pearls and rubies.
[20398.92s -> 20399.24s]  Nice.
[20399.80s -> 20404.46s]  The other treasure is over there.
[20404.54s -> 20405.58s]  Or over there.
[20405.58s -> 20408.54s]  I think I can just go.
[20420.52s -> 20422.20s]  Nice.
[20422.20s -> 20424.49s]  Hey, I got to go to bed.
[20424.49s -> 20426.65s]  Hope you're enjoying Resident Evil 4 Remastered.
[20426.65s -> 20431.00s]  It is fantastic.
[20431.00s -> 20433.40s]  There's one more.
[20433.40s -> 20435.42s]  Oh, well.
[20444.60s -> 20452.94s]  Did he drop his staff?
[20470.62s -> 20544.38s]  Oh, whoa.
[20544.38s -> 20544.86s]  Don't fall.
[20550.28s -> 20551.48s]  Don't push me off, please.
[20567.93s -> 20593.11s]  Let's go.
[20593.11s -> 20615.38s]  Don't miss that.
[20615.38s -> 20617.66s]  Just a silver token.
[20617.66s -> 20618.30s]  That sucks.
[20648.31s -> 20649.11s]  Ashley.
[20649.11s -> 20649.75s]  I forgot.
[20653.03s -> 20653.51s]  It's just...
[20654.15s -> 20656.15s]  It's so out of place.
[20656.15s -> 20656.87s]  It really is.
[20656.87s -> 20677.30s]  I completely forgot that she was in that outfit.
[20677.30s -> 20713.08s]  Almost there.
[20713.08s -> 20714.52s]  Damn, a rifle would be pretty good here.
[20714.52s -> 20716.94s]  Ban that person for five minutes.
[20716.94s -> 20719.59s]  No, ban that person for six minutes.
[20719.59s -> 20721.56s]  We're going over.
[20721.56s -> 20751.86s]  We're going overboard.
[20751.86s -> 20752.42s]  Nice shot.
[20771.26s -> 20774.14s]  She's getting kicked out of the My Chemical Romance concert.
[20783.90s -> 20784.86s]  All right, I got another...
[20786.14s -> 20789.72s]  I think I'm at max health.
[20789.72s -> 20793.46s]  This should do it, right?
[20793.46s -> 20794.58s]  That little bit that's left.
[20794.58s -> 20796.58s]  That should give me 100% max HP.
[20798.58s -> 20803.00s]  Then we don't really care about yellow herbs anymore, which is interesting.
[20803.00s -> 20803.48s]  That's good.
[20826.50s -> 20827.94s]  Do I complete the clock?
[20839.14s -> 20841.30s]  Red is the shittiest, right?
[20865.11s -> 20865.59s]  Not quite.
[20866.15s -> 20868.44s]  We need a red or...
[20868.44s -> 20869.88s]  I could take the green out of this.
[20869.88s -> 20877.56s]  That'd be a poor color.
[20877.56s -> 20878.28s]  Yeah, that's good.
[20878.28s -> 20881.34s]  I still apparently have...
[20881.34s -> 20883.56s]  I didn't use all these keys.
[20892.28s -> 20895.35s]  I'll pay a pretty penny for that.
[20895.35s -> 20900.79s]  Okay, now the question becomes I have 100,000 gold.
[20901.43s -> 20905.90s]  I'm going to pull out the revolver.
[20910.55s -> 20911.35s]  What can we do here?
[20911.91s -> 20923.40s]  A well-tuned weapon can make up for a lack of skill, friend.
[20932.55s -> 20933.99s]  Try that on for size.
[20933.99s -> 20934.87s]  I've made my decision.
[20935.51s -> 20940.78s]  We're starting to get an idea of your tastes, friend.
[20940.78s -> 20943.10s]  This kind of work is about finesse.
[20943.10s -> 20943.90s]  I've made my choice.
[20944.54s -> 20946.70s]  A little bit goes a long way.
[20947.42s -> 20948.06s]  You'll see.
[20948.86s -> 20952.68s]  I'm going to max this out.
[20953.40s -> 20955.64s]  And I'm going to be so fucked up in the end.
[20956.28s -> 20958.04s]  Don't get yourself killed now.
[20960.44s -> 20961.64s]  I'm going to be so fucked up.
[20962.52s -> 20967.98s]  I'm going to have like 25 magnum shots and 50 shotgun shots
[20967.98s -> 20969.50s]  that are all going to come out in 10 seconds.
[20970.06s -> 20977.99s]  I could go up.
[20977.99s -> 20980.20s]  What is going up to?
[20980.92s -> 20982.33s]  What is...
[20983.13s -> 20983.77s]  What's up, Doug?
[20984.33s -> 20991.13s]  First aid spray.
[20997.29s -> 20998.25s]  What the fuck?
[20998.25s -> 20999.77s]  Oh, my God.
[21000.25s -> 21001.13s]  You got me.
[21001.13s -> 21001.77s]  Who got me?
[21004.73s -> 21007.91s]  Okay.
[21007.91s -> 21012.94s]  Actually, let me save it because I'll forget to do that again.
[21012.94s -> 21014.86s]  How's my eye twitching?
[21022.07s -> 21023.83s]  I have 15 saves.
[21023.83s -> 21024.87s]  I'm such a...
[21024.87s -> 21026.31s]  I save every two seconds.
[21027.80s -> 21029.08s]  No way I'd be able to ever do that.
[21032.44s -> 21033.88s]  This is dark Jerma today.
[21033.88s -> 21034.52s]  No, it's not.
[21036.41s -> 21037.93s]  I think this is pretty neutral.
[21037.93s -> 21038.65s]  No, I'm very...
[21038.65s -> 21039.13s]  This is...
[21039.13s -> 21039.85s]  I think this is...
[21039.85s -> 21041.21s]  This is definitely not dark Jerma.
[21041.77s -> 21044.15s]  No, you've seen dark Jerma before.
[21060.50s -> 21061.14s]  Here we go.
[21062.36s -> 21065.16s]  50 shots in this thing and they all come out in five seconds.
[21067.05s -> 21067.77s]  I got it.
[21067.77s -> 21070.09s]  48 shotgun bullets loaded.
[21071.16s -> 21072.76s]  And just because I want to know,
[21073.40s -> 21074.60s]  I want to know.
[21074.60s -> 21075.40s]  I want to see.
[21078.63s -> 21081.99s]  I want to time how long it takes to unload the whole thing.
[21081.99s -> 21082.79s]  I want to test it.
[21083.43s -> 21088.70s]  Okay.
[21088.70s -> 21089.34s]  Let's test it.
[21099.02s -> 21113.14s]  This thing is fucking crazy.
[21121.94s -> 21128.30s]  Oh, shit.
[21128.30s -> 21128.78s]  I'm out.
[21129.34s -> 21141.10s]  So I have to just open the...
[21141.10s -> 21143.42s]  You know, when like the eye opens or whatever,
[21143.42s -> 21146.94s]  just go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[21146.94s -> 21148.46s]  Do that like three times and I win.
[21148.46s -> 21154.14s]  Okay.
[21154.14s -> 21158.20s]  Let's go.
[21158.20s -> 21159.24s]  I want to...
[21159.24s -> 21161.64s]  Wait, let me load this because I upgraded it, didn't I?
[21162.36s -> 21171.80s]  You know what kind of stinks?
[21172.60s -> 21173.24s]  It's not a big deal.
[21174.04s -> 21177.08s]  I can't mouse scroll to the other weapon.
[21177.08s -> 21178.20s]  I have to press five.
[21178.84s -> 21184.57s]  Look at this thing.
[21184.57s -> 21189.37s]  20 shots in this thing.
[21189.37s -> 21190.25s]  It's middle click.
[21195.24s -> 21196.52s]  Oh, it is.
[21197.24s -> 21198.90s]  Okay.
[21198.90s -> 21199.30s]  Thank you.
[21199.86s -> 21203.46s]  Took me to the last third of the game to figure that out.
[21213.90s -> 21220.09s]  I've delivered the girl to you as promised.
[21220.09s -> 21226.73s]  Do tell our lord to not forget the loyalty of his servant, Ramon.
[21226.73s -> 21234.23s]  Ashley!
[21239.72s -> 21242.04s]  Such a fool, Mr. Genity.
[21242.84s -> 21245.88s]  To have been bestowed with lower subtleties.
[21245.88s -> 21246.84s]  You talk too much.
[21246.84s -> 21248.04s]  I get failed.
[21249.96s -> 21256.07s]  You vulgar, alien civilized mongrel.
[21263.48s -> 21266.12s]  Not the bubbling boss sound.
[21268.34s -> 21272.50s]  Not the bubbling sludge boss sound effect.
[21311.80s -> 21313.56s]  Hey, not fair RNG.
[21313.56s -> 21313.96s]  Look at that.
[21328.49s -> 21329.53s]  Just give me the go ahead.
[21329.53s -> 21331.45s]  Now I'm going to fucking unload on them.
[21331.45s -> 21334.98s]  Give me the go ahead.
[21352.71s -> 21353.43s]  Give me the green light.
[21353.43s -> 21354.15s]  Give me the green light.
[21361.02s -> 21361.52s]  Yeah.
[21368.70s -> 21370.22s]  What are you going to do, motherfucker?
[21371.42s -> 21372.78s]  What are you going to do about it?
[21377.75s -> 21381.00s]  Fucking go.
[21381.64s -> 21382.20s]  Let's go.
[21384.92s -> 21385.48s]  Let's go.
[21386.58s -> 21387.62s]  Cue the cut scene.
[21388.18s -> 21395.19s]  He didn't even get a chance to say half his lines.
[21395.19s -> 21407.90s]  And I still got half my bullets.
[21407.90s -> 21408.70s]  We're good.
[21408.70s -> 21414.49s]  It's so fucking stupid.
[21414.49s -> 21427.06s]  I made him come out of his shell like five times.
[21427.06s -> 21432.22s]  You just got clown makeup?
[21432.22s -> 21433.58s]  That was fucking fun.
[21433.58s -> 21434.94s]  I told you it was worth it.
[21438.12s -> 21439.22s]  All right.
[21439.22s -> 21442.22s]  That was fun.
[21442.22s -> 21443.26s]  I got everything in the room, right?
[21443.26s -> 21446.15s]  Let me just check.
[21446.15s -> 21446.79s]  No, I did not.
[21446.79s -> 21447.75s]  Just go around and look at this.
[21447.75s -> 21449.67s]  All these things that want to be to use.
[21450.55s -> 21451.35s]  What's in here?
[21452.15s -> 21453.19s]  Handgun ammo.
[21453.19s -> 21454.71s]  Oh, I ran out of ammo.
[21454.71s -> 21455.59s]  Craft.
[21455.59s -> 21455.99s]  What's this?
[21457.02s -> 21458.06s]  Oh, a bunch of gunpowder.
[21458.62s -> 21460.46s]  Make some more arrows.
[21460.46s -> 21461.66s]  Oh, I have to dodge that.
[21461.66s -> 21462.06s]  Shit.
[21462.06s -> 21474.97s]  Oh, I got hit.
[21474.97s -> 21479.88s]  Nice ego.
[21479.88s -> 21481.40s]  That was so funny.
[21481.40s -> 21483.00s]  I loved every second of that.
[21483.00s -> 21488.33s]  I think I cleared out everything.
[21488.33s -> 21488.81s]  Yep.
[21488.81s -> 21494.92s]  It probably would have been cheaper to buy an RPG
[21494.92s -> 21495.88s]  and just shoot him once.
[21496.44s -> 21499.99s]  It was the fun in that, though.
[21500.55s -> 21503.35s]  It is kind of fun, but you know.
[21503.35s -> 21505.72s]  Ashley, no time to lose.
[21508.33s -> 21514.55s]  Come on.
[21514.55s -> 21516.15s]  Let's start replenishing it.
[21516.15s -> 21527.30s]  Already almost there.
[21527.86s -> 21536.68s]  All right.
[21536.68s -> 21538.52s]  Next save point, I'm going to call it.
[21538.52s -> 21541.56s]  And then I'll give you the schedule for this coming week.
[21548.50s -> 21550.26s]  Still four chapters left.
[21552.47s -> 21564.17s]  Five chapters left.
[21564.17s -> 21564.57s]  16.
[21564.57s -> 21565.37s]  Wait, where are we?
[21565.37s -> 21566.97s]  Number 11 or 12.
[21566.97s -> 21568.09s]  We still have this Krauser.
[21569.29s -> 21571.61s]  There's at least two or three other encounters left.
[21579.11s -> 21579.67s]  First playthrough?
[21579.67s -> 21580.15s]  Nope.
[21580.15s -> 21581.83s]  This would be well of the remake.
[21581.83s -> 21586.57s]  Yeah, but this is probably the third or fourth time
[21586.57s -> 21588.01s]  I played through Resident Evil 4.
[21588.73s -> 21592.44s]  There is no.
[21593.56s -> 21598.44s]  Yeah, we still have the scary chapter or two.
[21599.48s -> 21601.56s]  There's at least two or three hours left still, at least.
[21602.74s -> 21603.78s]  Might even be like four.
[21604.34s -> 21606.07s]  So this would be another stream for sure.
[21606.71s -> 21608.10s]  Yeah, the lab.
[21608.10s -> 21610.34s]  Yeah, this is at least four plus hours.
[21610.90s -> 21633.53s]  Where is this hanging?
[21633.53s -> 21634.09s]  Did I miss it?
[21634.09s -> 21641.02s]  Yeah, still top 20.
[21641.02s -> 21641.90s]  Yeah, I would say.
[21642.46s -> 21648.70s]  I mean, the Resident Evil 4 video game is definitely top 20, top 25 games of all time.
[21648.70s -> 21652.57s]  I failed you, my lord.
[21652.57s -> 21654.49s]  I was unable to fulfill your final commandment
[21654.49s -> 21656.81s]  and keep the boy from the path of wickedness.
[21656.81s -> 21663.16s]  Got a glimpse of Master Ramon's evil temperament during his younger years.
[21663.16s -> 21666.95s]  When he discovered a servant mocked him by uttering,
[21666.95s -> 21669.11s]  Pull Garcito behind his back.
[21669.11s -> 21671.19s]  He summoned her to his private chambers.
[21671.19s -> 21673.05s]  After forcing her to kneel before him,
[21673.05s -> 21677.78s]  Ramon doused her face with a vial of vitriol he pulled out of his pocket.
[21681.11s -> 21685.75s]  The young master watched with glee when the servant writhed in agony as the skin melted
[21685.75s -> 21686.79s]  from her face.
[21686.79s -> 21689.27s]  His twisted grin still haunts my dreams to this day.
[21689.27s -> 21692.23s]  As time passed, Ramon's treachery only deepened
[21692.23s -> 21696.41s]  and that infernal cult soon learned they could prey upon his vulnerable heart.
[21696.41s -> 21697.29s]  Curse the fiends!
[21699.38s -> 21702.42s]  They've manipulated Master Ramon and turned him into their puppet.
[21702.42s -> 21705.38s]  Worst of all, they've managed to use him to unleash his pagas
[21705.38s -> 21709.93s]  that the Salazar family has fought so long and hard to keep sealed away.
[21709.93s -> 21714.49s]  Lord Diego, first assured I intend to watch over Master Ramon until the very end.
[21714.49s -> 21716.65s]  Whatever fate may be foul us.
[21716.65s -> 21719.70s]  As a faithful servant of the Salazar family since birth,
[21719.70s -> 21721.78s]  it is my duty and my penance to you.
[21735.45s -> 21738.07s]  Perfect. Won't have to swim after all.
[21738.07s -> 21742.39s]  Yeah, next save point I'm gonna call it.
[21743.11s -> 21758.54s]  What's the worst feeling texture?
[21760.15s -> 21761.70s]  Damn it.
[21761.70s -> 21762.20s]  Chalkboard.
[21763.94s -> 21772.12s]  Yeah, there it is.
[21772.12s -> 21784.07s]  Okay, no thanks bro.
[21784.63s -> 21787.35s]  Defeat five enemies with the iron balls.
[21788.15s -> 21790.06s]  Increase your maximum health to the limit.
[21790.06s -> 21790.56s]  Cool.
[21793.08s -> 21795.42s]  And that is it.
[21797.11s -> 21797.83s]  Thanks for watching.
[21798.97s -> 21800.73s]  We are at chapter 13.
[21802.07s -> 21803.51s]  There are three chapters left.
[21803.51s -> 21805.99s]  Each of these will probably be about an hour and a half or so hour.
[21807.05s -> 21809.21s]  Sounds like this is about three or four hours plus.
[21809.21s -> 21810.49s]  It's about maybe one more stream.
[21810.49s -> 21811.69s]  Maybe do some more side content.
[21812.89s -> 21815.05s]  Also unlocking the other stuff after beating the game.
[21815.91s -> 21819.59s]  Which should be fun to play for like an hour or two.
[21819.59s -> 21820.23s]  So here's the deal.
[21821.26s -> 21824.18s]  The next time you'll see me live will probably be...
[21824.82s -> 21828.68s]  It's 1 a.m. Holy shit.
[21828.68s -> 21829.16s]  Let's see.
[21830.12s -> 21835.93s]  Probably Wednesday.
[21835.93s -> 21839.08s]  Maybe we'll do Wednesday, Friday, Saturday.
[21839.40s -> 21843.85s]  We'll finish Resident Evil 4 on Wednesday.
[21843.85s -> 21852.50s]  And then we will go to Breath of the Wild on Thursday or Friday.
[21852.50s -> 21854.63s]  Something like that.
[21854.63s -> 21860.34s]  So I'll see you in a couple days.
[21860.34s -> 21863.93s]  The games, like I said, last time, the last two streams.
[21863.93s -> 21864.65s]  It's great.
[21864.65s -> 21865.30s]  It's just great.
[21865.30s -> 21867.62s]  It's great to play this again and just pre-experience it.
[21867.62s -> 21869.72s]  It's fantastic.
[21869.72s -> 21880.14s]  I love it.
[21880.14s -> 21883.18s]  Thanks again.
[21883.18s -> 21884.54s]  Wednesday, probably around the same time.
[21884.54s -> 21886.22s]  Probably around six o'clock Pacific.
[21886.22s -> 21899.80s]  Let me just get out of here.
[21899.80s -> 21900.44s]  Okay.
[21900.44s -> 21903.58s]  I need to exit the game.
[21903.58s -> 21913.42s]  There we go.
[21913.42s -> 21914.06s]  There we are.
[21914.06s -> 21924.49s]  All right, because I gotta get the music on.
[21924.49s -> 21927.05s]  I'll give you a dollar if you keep playing.
[21927.05s -> 21929.21s]  Well, I'm gonna keep playing, just not tonight.
[21929.21s -> 21930.60s]  On Wednesday.
[21930.60s -> 21942.52s]  A couple days.
[21942.52s -> 21943.40s]  A dollar?
[21943.40s -> 21948.89s]  What about two dollars?
[21948.89s -> 21962.62s]  No, I'll give you a dollar oh one.
[21962.62s -> 21964.06s]  Keep slaying, Queens.
[21965.18s -> 21969.56s]  This man just scammed an innocent viewer.
[21973.22s -> 21974.90s]  That proposition was said to me.
[21975.62s -> 21977.86s]  And I said that I would be playing it again.
[21978.66s -> 21980.26s]  Hey, hey, watch out.
[21980.26s -> 21984.26s]  You gotta make sure you ask the right question.
[21984.26s -> 21984.82s]  He didn't say.
[21985.91s -> 21987.99s]  I'll give you a dollar to continue playing tonight.
[21988.07s -> 21989.11s]  Said continue playing.
[21989.67s -> 21997.29s]  I would choose your words more carefully next time.
[21997.29s -> 21997.77s]  Loki.
[22003.59s -> 22004.55s]  All right, good night.
[22004.55s -> 22005.43s]  See you later.
[22005.43s -> 22006.47s]  Call your mother.
[22006.47s -> 22007.99s]  Take care of yourselves.
[22007.99s -> 22009.11s]  Have a good rest of your,
[22009.11s -> 22011.11s]  what is left of your weekend, maybe some of you.
[22013.62s -> 22014.82s]  See you Wednesday.
[22014.82s -> 22017.42s]  Take it easy, guys.
