[1.14s -> 8.74s]  Hello everybody. Give me one second and we'll get started. Be back in a minute.
[8.74s -> 102.31s]  Tweeted something. Got my drink. Alright, so today we're gonna be playing some
[102.31s -> 112.72s]  Dreams. I'm gonna try to play Dreams. He speaks. He speaks, finally. Yeah. I had to
[112.72s -> 122.55s]  get this shit going here. Let me just move my character. We're gonna explain
[122.55s -> 126.18s]  what's gonna happen here. Okay. Let me just get it on the screen because it's
[126.18s -> 130.34s]  already here. Sorry, I'm listening to three things at the same time. So today
[130.34s -> 136.78s]  we're gonna play Dreams. I cannot guarantee that I'm going to be very good
[136.78s -> 141.98s]  at this. I did all the tutorials. Well, not all of them. It actually did take a
[141.98s -> 146.02s]  long time, so I think I only didn't do one and it was like the master
[146.02s -> 154.82s]  class one. So I do know a handful of things. Yeah, somebody said it took me
[155.02s -> 161.44s]  eight hours to do them. Yeah, it's a lot. So I am very much at the baby steps.
[161.44s -> 165.95s]  I've done the painting, advanced tutorials, the sculpt tutorials. I know
[165.95s -> 174.37s]  how to use the program now and I made something. You'll see it in just a
[174.37s -> 183.97s]  second. Just learn how to code. It really is. It is like a, it is
[183.97s -> 190.69s]  absolutely a full game engine. It is a full movie maker. It's a full game
[190.69s -> 195.13s]  engine. It's a full sculpting tool. It's like having every single one of these
[195.13s -> 206.75s]  programs and it's really, really cool. Now, what is gonna happen today? Here's
[206.75s -> 212.86s]  what's gonna happen today. I'll tell you. This is going to be a, I had a, I
[212.86s -> 216.83s]  don't know, I was trying to think of like what to do with it because I tried
[216.83s -> 221.23s]  searching. Remember I said, oh, I'm gonna look for like the tags or search
[221.27s -> 227.65s]  for Jerma in the title. There's nothing. Nobody has made anything with the, with
[227.65s -> 237.94s]  Jerma in the title. So there's zero. I made something, but I do want to learn
[237.94s -> 246.86s]  how to play this and previously years ago what I would do is I would just
[246.86s -> 252.94s]  spend two straight weeks in here making anything I wanted, learning
[252.94s -> 256.49s]  everything, making sure I knew what I was doing. It's kind of not possible
[256.77s -> 263.06s]  to do that unless it's kind of broadcasted out. You know what I'm saying?
[263.06s -> 267.38s]  Because think about it. If I stream, you know, three, four, five days a week, I
[267.38s -> 273.46s]  am not doing this and it used to be I would just sit here for like 50
[273.46s -> 283.06s]  hours and do it. Don't let your dreams be dreams. But anyways, I'm gonna go
[283.06s -> 288.47s]  ahead and show you when have I ever streamed five days a week last week.
[289.31s -> 301.95s]  That happened to literally last week. Anyways, anyways, I'm gonna show you what
[301.95s -> 313.58s]  I have. This is the culmination of hours of work. I tried my hardest. I'm still
[313.58s -> 327.74s]  learning. It's not a dunk tank. I don't even want to put it on screen. I have
[327.74s -> 338.37s]  to. It's so bad. Alright, ladies and gentlemen, here is my creation. It's
[338.45s -> 340.17s]  called scorpion boss.
[368.37s -> 372.82s]  He wasn't supposed to scream yet, but we're gonna dodge roll.
[373.86s -> 375.10s]  It's German scorpion.
[380.90s -> 382.02s]  I did something wrong.
[382.91s -> 383.99s]  Because he's supposed to go.
[388.86s -> 403.98s]  I beat it. I did it. That's all I got. That's the only thing I made. It's
[403.98s -> 404.90s]  really hard.
[405.22s -> 428.43s]  That's again, again, how many hours was this? I don't know. Like one, two. No,
[428.43s -> 434.22s]  it was like one. It didn't take that long. Again, again.
[441.76s -> 449.26s]  First try. I beat German scorpion. First try.
[457.41s -> 461.98s]  The first time I haven't played around with the sculpt tool. Come on,
[461.98s -> 480.94s]  give me a break. What is this music? This is Gwyn from Dark Souls. Worst
[480.98s -> 485.98s]  thing I ever saw. That was literally like I just had finished the tutorials
[485.98s -> 501.78s]  and I was like, I'm gonna try to do anything. There it is. See? Okay,
[501.78s -> 510.99s]  this is literally last this morning at 2 48 a.m. I spent all yesterday doing
[510.99s -> 519.30s]  the tutorials and it culminated here earlier this morning at 3 a.m. Go to
[519.30s -> 524.26s]  sleep, Jeremy. I can't. I had to make German scorpion. Anyways,
[525.50s -> 532.54s]  release. I don't think so. I'm going to come back and fix it. All right,
[532.54s -> 542.09s]  so let's go back. So let me explain again what's going to happen today.
[548.74s -> 557.16s]  I need to see that. Somebody said the German scorpion face is what the
[557.16s -> 561.56s]  official German 985 popsicle would look like.
[561.56s -> 598.41s]  An ice cream bar. Oh, he killed me. Oh, my God. I'm never going to fucking
[598.41s -> 601.89s]  be able to not. I'm only going to think about that for the next like 30
[601.89s -> 606.41s]  minutes. All right, let's we're going to start fresh. I'm going to make
[606.41s -> 609.01s]  like I'm going to make something really easy. I'm going to make like
[609.01s -> 618.06s]  a rock. Okay, I need to start small. I tried to go way too big here. I
[618.06s -> 621.58s]  was going to make like a Dark Souls boss and no, no, no, no. I know I
[621.58s -> 627.63s]  got to start small. I'm going to make a rock. Okay, we're going to do.
[629.32s -> 633.02s]  I'm just going to I'm going to make a character. Although I didn't I
[633.02s -> 637.58s]  didn't even do that tutorial sculpture sculpture. Okay, I'm just
[637.58s -> 646.34s]  going to make a sculpture here. I'm going to make a didn't do that
[646.34s -> 650.06s]  tutorial. No, it takes like takes like two days to do these
[650.06s -> 655.24s]  tutorials. Okay, I'm going to make a character here, or I'm going to
[655.24s -> 659.71s]  make a sculpture, something that I'm going to try to do it as best I
[659.71s -> 665.74s]  can. So if you don't know how this works, is I didn't I didn't show
[665.74s -> 669.10s]  this last time. It's really important. Look at how insane this
[669.10s -> 711.90s]  is. Probably should have started with a square. Oh, god damn it.
[711.94s -> 715.99s]  Okay. Nevermind. Here's what we're gonna do. I'm gonna show
[715.99s -> 720.58s]  you. I'm still learning. Alright, so anyways, the way that this
[720.62s -> 725.62s]  works is you have a literal smear tool that you can paint in three
[725.62s -> 735.96s]  dimensions. And guess what, you can also take it away too. This
[735.96s -> 741.46s]  is what was blowing my mind yesterday is this shit. Being
[741.46s -> 748.84s]  able to carve out almost like clay is really, really, really
[748.84s -> 758.45s]  fun. And you can do this with any shape to make a
[758.45s -> 766.92s]  Minecraft pig. Oh, lagging here. Oh, alright, so let's
[766.92s -> 771.24s]  start with I'm gonna make the fucking popsicle thing is
[771.24s -> 777.21s]  killing me. I need to stop using the flesh skin color.
[777.65s -> 786.81s]  Yeah, but it's like, that was like Doctor's Office level of
[786.81s -> 790.47s]  realism. I don't know what to say about that. I really
[790.47s -> 796.60s]  don't. That was like image and like sex ed class level of
[796.60s -> 803.38s]  like fucking how perfect it was. Let's start simple. Okay,
[808.17s -> 810.21s]  I'm just gonna make like a mountain. I'm gonna make a
[810.21s -> 817.71s]  mountain. Sculpt a frog. Well, let me just because look
[817.71s -> 828.24s]  ready to do this. Using the controller is kind of finicky,
[828.24s -> 841.36s]  but it's still fun. Done. I'm done. That was fun, huh? And
[841.36s -> 844.24s]  there's a way that you can blend this shit together too,
[849.16s -> 856.92s]  which is what I should be doing. That's fine. This is
[856.92s -> 863.37s]  fine like this, because hold on. I need to go into
[863.37s -> 867.71s]  here. See if you wonder this is this means it's going to
[867.75s -> 870.79s]  do it's going to be a gradient essentially. I'll show you
[870.79s -> 876.07s]  see, it just picks a random color in that gradient. It's
[876.07s -> 879.66s]  pretty good. Now, you're probably asking, well, what
[879.66s -> 882.46s]  are these might be too small. They're not. They are
[882.46s -> 887.10s]  not the great thing about dreams is once these are
[887.10s -> 890.85s]  connected together, you can make them as big or as
[890.85s -> 895.05s]  small as you want forever. They could be an inch tall
[895.05s -> 901.30s]  or they can be 30 feet high, 100 feet high. Alright,
[901.30s -> 906.40s]  so, but I'm just in like the sculpting menu. See,
[906.40s -> 909.86s]  for instance, look at this. You ready? I can make
[909.86s -> 914.42s]  this as big or as small as I want. You can start
[914.42s -> 921.13s]  small. And as you see, this is pretty good E3
[921.13s -> 924.24s]  demo. Well, I want to go small because then we
[924.24s -> 928.47s]  can we can scale it from there. Okay, let's get
[928.47s -> 932.02s]  back in here. And I'm going to add and I'm going
[932.02s -> 934.10s]  to do whatever this is like kind of rough
[934.10s -> 936.30s]  looking. Don't worry, I'll fix it. It's gonna be
[936.30s -> 942.77s]  snow. Actually, I can I can make snow here. I
[942.77s -> 946.13s]  need a painting tool. No, no, no, no. I'm not
[946.13s -> 948.01s]  making like rocks. Yeah, this is just the rock
[948.05s -> 957.01s]  structure. Let's go back here. Okay, this is
[957.01s -> 959.89s]  just the structure of the rocks. I'm going to
[959.89s -> 964.34s]  put some more rocks on it. Um, what do I need
[964.34s -> 967.72s]  to do? I need to go to Yeah, this mirror is
[967.72s -> 972.32s]  fine. I need the color to be. We'll just we'll
[972.32s -> 973.76s]  do this. We'll we'll make it just kind of a
[973.76s -> 979.88s]  random color, random rock type color. Oh,
[979.92s -> 982.00s]  shit. This is I want this in I want this part of
[982.00s -> 988.06s]  this. There we go. Okay, so see, we're gonna make
[988.06s -> 994.59s]  a little bubbles on it. Let's get in there a
[994.59s -> 1012.51s]  little closer. I mean, you might be asking
[1012.51s -> 1013.83s]  about it looks a little rough, but it's all
[1013.83s -> 1026.70s]  right. We're gonna do all kinds of cool shit
[1026.70s -> 1034.50s]  to this. All right. It's like little puff
[1034.50s -> 1055.46s]  balls. Looks okay. Hold on. This is snow.
[1055.90s -> 1075.46s]  No, it's pustules. Is this the snow? Was
[1075.46s -> 1088.41s]  this supposed to be the snow? You tell us.
[1089.30s -> 1091.90s]  I'm just experimenting. All right. Yeah, it
[1091.90s -> 1093.34s]  was supposed to be the snow. All right, get in
[1093.34s -> 1098.24s]  there. So this is gonna be different. This is
[1098.24s -> 1106.52s]  gonna be different. Hold on. I want it to be
[1106.52s -> 1108.98s]  the circle. And then we're gonna make some
[1108.98s -> 1110.90s]  snow here. Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[1110.90s -> 1115.28s]  no, no. I need the paint tool. Paint mode. I
[1115.28s -> 1118.16s]  need. What do you think? What looks like
[1118.16s -> 1123.94s]  snow? That's kind of snowy. Because then
[1123.94s -> 1131.86s]  now this just becomes an object. Okay, get
[1131.86s -> 1145.48s]  in close. Let's see here. Dots. That could
[1145.48s -> 1159.54s]  be snow. And then just sprinkle that
[1159.54s -> 1163.90s]  around the top. Okay. What else? What are
[1163.90s -> 1165.30s]  these else? I don't know what these look
[1165.30s -> 1168.70s]  like. This is actually one of the first
[1168.70s -> 1172.64s]  times I played with the paint tool. No,
[1172.68s -> 1180.08s]  I think this is it. I do. So you can
[1180.08s -> 1182.73s]  take, you can have it snapped to
[1182.73s -> 1183.79s]  surfaces. You can paint it on
[1183.79s -> 1185.87s]  surfaces. You can have it. You can put
[1185.87s -> 1187.43s]  a grid up to have it so you can't
[1187.43s -> 1188.75s]  really get lost. You'll get like
[1189.55s -> 1192.07s]  snapped over and over. Well, you can do
[1192.07s -> 1193.59s]  the kaleidoscope tool, which
[1194.43s -> 1198.33s]  interestingly enough, see what it does
[1198.33s -> 1202.09s]  here. You can kind of make it as many
[1202.09s -> 1204.53s]  as you want spreading out. So you can
[1204.53s -> 1207.83s]  go do cool stuff like this. You can
[1207.83s -> 1213.58s]  make like flowers and shit. But we're
[1213.58s -> 1218.55s]  making snow. I think it's going to be
[1218.55s -> 1219.59s]  dots. Maybe I'll make them a little
[1219.59s -> 1220.83s]  bit, maybe I'll make them smaller.
[1223.05s -> 1225.01s]  Look, this is just to get into this
[1225.01s -> 1225.65s]  one of your things, you know what I'm
[1225.65s -> 1229.69s]  saying? Take our kaleidoscope. I
[1229.69s -> 1231.77s]  don't really know what this shit does.
[1236.22s -> 1240.66s]  Okay, tools. Let's go with the draw
[1240.66s -> 1242.22s]  flex, because this is more precise.
[1242.22s -> 1244.50s]  And by precise, I mean, if you look
[1244.98s -> 1248.10s]  ready, you can start small. And the
[1248.10s -> 1249.62s]  more you hold down right trigger, the
[1249.62s -> 1256.46s]  bigger the fleck will get. So let's
[1256.46s -> 1259.14s]  go ahead and get over here and paint
[1259.14s -> 1264.13s]  some snow. I'm just gonna Okay,
[1264.13s -> 1265.97s]  let's go with what's a good snow
[1265.97s -> 1270.55s]  color? I mean, white, like teeth
[1270.55s -> 1275.87s]  white. That's gonna be like teeth
[1275.87s -> 1279.95s]  white. Okay. And then let's zoom in
[1279.95s -> 1287.69s]  a little. And I want the dots. Now
[1287.69s -> 1292.95s]  hold on here. How to opacity
[1292.95s -> 1298.04s]  scatter. We'll do opacity scatter
[1298.04s -> 1304.22s]  is no, that looks fine. Okay, so
[1304.22s -> 1306.82s]  let's get in there and make some
[1306.82s -> 1329.22s]  snow. Tilt it a little. I think it
[1329.22s -> 1331.87s]  looks all right. Okay, there's my
[1331.87s -> 1341.23s]  place. Why is it blue now? Why is
[1341.23s -> 1344.45s]  it blue? Oh, I didn't pick the
[1344.45s -> 1346.98s]  finish. Stupid idiot. All right,
[1346.98s -> 1350.21s]  plastic, shiny, snow is pretty
[1350.21s -> 1354.67s]  shiny. Yeah, snow is pretty shiny,
[1354.67s -> 1374.18s]  isn't it? Okay, seeing now how
[1374.18s -> 1377.09s]  difficult this is to do. Trying to
[1377.09s -> 1378.93s]  work in 3d space with a dual shock
[1378.93s -> 1386.21s]  controller is almost unbearable. Get
[1386.21s -> 1394.38s]  just get down there. Get over
[1394.38s -> 1397.20s]  here. This is driving me crazy
[1397.20s -> 1398.36s]  right now. Okay, don't just bring
[1398.36s -> 1404.60s]  it over here. Learn to control
[1404.60s -> 1405.92s]  it. I mean, I know how to control
[1405.92s -> 1407.92s]  it. It's just really hard to use.
[1408.32s -> 1431.71s]  Like this. I need to turn on the
[1431.71s -> 1437.02s]  snapping for this thing. There it
[1437.02s -> 1441.11s]  is. obey auto guides. Where is it?
[1442.00s -> 1445.01s]  No, no, it's not. I have to like
[1445.01s -> 1448.27s]  go like this. Come here. I did
[1448.27s -> 1471.26s]  make that very small. Smaller. Is
[1471.26s -> 1473.38s]  that close enough? Close enough for
[1473.38s -> 1483.71s]  a picture. I still need to rough
[1483.71s -> 1487.08s]  this up a little bit. Is there a
[1487.08s -> 1488.52s]  paint to surface? There might be.
[1488.52s -> 1489.88s]  It's just I'm still trying to
[1489.88s -> 1491.04s]  figure out how the fuck to do
[1491.04s -> 1493.12s]  this. Because this is sculpt, but
[1493.12s -> 1496.25s]  then paint is, as I said, this
[1496.25s -> 1497.93s]  is a complete learning experience
[1497.93s -> 1506.20s]  for all of us. There's a snap to
[1506.20s -> 1509.76s]  surface, which is here. Okay,
[1509.76s -> 1515.74s]  yeah, there it is. Well, let's go
[1515.74s -> 1517.54s]  ahead and do that then. Let's
[1517.54s -> 1522.52s]  get rid of that. So let's go
[1522.52s -> 1527.08s]  back to the dots. Make sure the
[1527.08s -> 1530.38s]  brush fleck is fine. Color is
[1530.38s -> 1532.38s]  not fine. Go back to white with
[1532.38s -> 1537.19s]  a shiny finish. And then snap to
[1537.19s -> 1540.06s]  surface is there. Right. Okay,
[1540.10s -> 1565.45s]  here we go. Make a massive pig.
[1566.51s -> 1567.67s]  Well, I'm just trying to learn to
[1567.67s -> 1579.22s]  use the tools properly. I just want
[1579.22s -> 1585.82s]  to go in and that's all right.
[1585.82s -> 1586.70s]  But I don't I don't want this
[1586.70s -> 1587.98s]  to be one object. That's what
[1587.98s -> 1598.33s]  will happen. Okay, how's that
[1598.33s -> 1601.07s]  look? I'm just gonna copy it
[1601.07s -> 1604.21s]  anyways. All right, let's see.
[1607.75s -> 1621.26s]  All right. Three snow things.
[1622.36s -> 1623.12s]  What am I gonna do with this
[1623.12s -> 1624.64s]  when I finish? Throw it in the
[1624.64s -> 1628.67s]  trash. Throw it into the
[1628.67s -> 1638.54s]  garbage can. Looks all right. This
[1638.54s -> 1651.98s]  has to come up though. Let's
[1651.98s -> 1653.70s]  make let's don't change this.
[1653.86s -> 1660.44s]  Let's go out again. Into what's
[1660.44s -> 1661.76s]  it called? You can just style
[1661.76s -> 1664.54s]  right? Okay, I'm gonna drop this
[1664.54s -> 1670.22s]  a little bit. It's gonna be an
[1670.22s -> 1675.46s]  expressionist pain. So I'm
[1675.46s -> 1676.18s]  doing right now is I'm
[1676.18s -> 1678.02s]  loosening up the fleck, which
[1678.02s -> 1679.42s]  is kind of another word for
[1679.42s -> 1684.62s]  pixel. That one looks stupid.
[1685.34s -> 1689.58s]  But it don't matter. We're
[1689.58s -> 1691.74s]  gonna see you can make it. You
[1691.74s -> 1695.32s]  can make it a mess. Does they
[1695.32s -> 1697.64s]  make really fucked up photos of
[1697.64s -> 1701.67s]  stuff? That's okay. Let's go
[1701.67s -> 1709.41s]  into is impasto. Let's go to
[1709.41s -> 1711.21s]  tint. I want a better rock
[1711.21s -> 1715.62s]  look. It's coat mode. So you
[1715.62s -> 1717.70s]  can apply tints. You can apply
[1717.70s -> 1736.50s]  finishes. Looks okay. All right.
[1736.50s -> 1737.66s]  What do I affect? See, you
[1737.66s -> 1738.62s]  can use this. The weird
[1738.62s -> 1739.26s]  part is you can make it
[1739.26s -> 1742.29s]  move around too. So ready? The
[1742.29s -> 1749.53s]  snow can be like moving. All
[1749.53s -> 1750.65s]  right. Well, now it's wind.
[1750.97s -> 1756.18s]  It's wind now. The rocks are
[1756.18s -> 1762.66s]  moving too. It's just missed
[1762.66s -> 1764.54s]  now. Yeah, it is missed. Good
[1764.54s -> 1783.11s]  idea. Back it up. It's gonna be
[1783.11s -> 1784.19s]  much lighter. I'm gonna break it
[1784.19s -> 1791.94s]  up even more. Okay, let's get
[1791.94s -> 1793.58s]  back in. I need to paint this
[1793.58s -> 1794.62s]  again. I need to mess this
[1794.62s -> 1797.71s]  all up. Where's the tool that
[1797.71s -> 1800.65s]  I need for that? I think it's
[1800.65s -> 1802.89s]  actually where's the damn
[1802.89s -> 1806.57s]  tool? Yeah, you can like
[1806.57s -> 1807.85s]  fray it out and really fuck
[1807.85s -> 1811.53s]  it up. Let's see. Ruffle
[1811.57s -> 1824.36s]  maybe. Yeah. Ruffle. Okay. You
[1824.36s -> 1837.46s]  can change the direction. Okay.
[1837.98s -> 1843.65s]  Doesn't look terrible. And then
[1843.65s -> 1850.27s]  we're gonna paint. Let's see.
[1851.18s -> 1852.26s]  This is just by the way, this
[1852.26s -> 1859.22s]  is just part one. This is you
[1859.22s -> 1860.10s]  guys understand that this is
[1860.10s -> 1863.84s]  the background for a popsicle
[1863.84s -> 1868.63s]  scene. This is what you do.
[1869.73s -> 1870.89s]  You just have to experiment
[1870.89s -> 1871.85s]  and play around till you find
[1871.85s -> 1877.28s]  something you like. Use the
[1877.28s -> 1879.80s]  brushes. Yeah, here's the
[1879.80s -> 1881.68s]  one problem, right? This is
[1881.68s -> 1882.44s]  the problem that I had with
[1882.44s -> 1884.60s]  this stream in particular. It's
[1884.64s -> 1886.96s]  it takes like probably 50 to
[1886.96s -> 1888.44s]  100 hours playing this game.
[1889.63s -> 1891.75s]  To know where everything is,
[1891.75s -> 1893.15s]  know how to do everything and
[1893.15s -> 1894.99s]  know exactly how to use every
[1894.99s -> 1896.83s]  tool. There's logic in this
[1896.83s -> 1900.82s]  game. There's actual logic
[1900.82s -> 1902.14s]  buttons and shit to connect
[1902.14s -> 1909.74s]  stuff to. But I think I just
[1909.74s -> 1910.62s]  want to try it, you know,
[1911.56s -> 1912.60s]  add background music. Oh,
[1912.60s -> 1913.52s]  you got it. Sure thing.
[1947.11s -> 1948.03s]  Holy shit.
[1960.01s -> 1984.59s]  See, look at the speed. We can
[1984.59s -> 1986.31s]  make a song too. I'm down with
[1986.31s -> 1994.70s]  that as well. Let's go back
[1994.70s -> 1998.05s]  here. Here we go. Playback
[1998.05s -> 1998.49s]  speed.
[2000.25s -> 2005.90s]  Bratz song, I might be able
[2005.90s -> 2021.18s]  to maybe. I hate it. I hate
[2021.18s -> 2025.66s]  it. I closed that out. So for
[2025.66s -> 2026.90s]  some reason, they had one
[2026.90s -> 2031.16s]  timeline connect to this
[2031.16s -> 2033.22s]  timeline. I don't know why you
[2033.22s -> 2033.94s]  just want to make the song
[2033.94s -> 2036.62s]  in one timeline. Let's, let's
[2036.62s -> 2037.94s]  actually get a song here,
[2037.94s -> 2045.32s]  though. A decent one. I'm
[2045.32s -> 2046.24s]  gonna make a little, okay,
[2046.24s -> 2046.88s]  here's what I'm gonna make a
[2046.88s -> 2051.75s]  house like here, but not
[2051.75s -> 2053.95s]  yet. I'm painting. God
[2053.95s -> 2056.64s]  dammit. So let's do, let's
[2056.64s -> 2058.47s]  just get a song. Something
[2058.47s -> 2062.06s]  easy. Make a Minecraft
[2062.06s -> 2062.98s]  house. I might, the house
[2062.98s -> 2063.82s]  I make is going to be real
[2063.82s -> 2071.41s]  bad. What? Holly. Wait,
[2071.41s -> 2072.05s]  is this like Kingdom
[2072.05s -> 2080.38s]  Hearts? Delphino Plaza.
[2080.38s -> 2081.70s]  These things, people made
[2081.70s -> 2096.58s]  these? Face my fears. This
[2096.58s -> 2100.78s]  is awesome. Animal Crossing
[2100.78s -> 2102.74s]  New Leaf 1 a.m. I think
[2102.74s -> 2104.14s]  that's pretty good. I think
[2104.14s -> 2104.66s]  that's what we're going to
[2104.66s -> 2111.07s]  have to look for. I actually
[2111.07s -> 2112.07s]  don't think this will play
[2112.39s -> 2116.10s]  when I'm editing. Sorry,
[2116.10s -> 2118.48s]  guys. Wait, wait, wait,
[2118.48s -> 2119.28s]  wait, wait, wait, wait,
[2119.28s -> 2120.28s]  wait, wait, wait, wait,
[2120.28s -> 2121.28s]  wait, wait, wait, wait,
[2121.28s -> 2131.50s]  wait, wait, wait, wait. I
[2131.50s -> 2138.49s]  need like snow. As the
[2138.49s -> 2139.81s]  congressional debate over
[2139.81s -> 2141.49s]  gun control flares up yet
[2141.49s -> 2143.41s]  again, we regret to report
[2143.41s -> 2144.57s]  the murder of a wife and
[2144.57s -> 2145.81s]  her two children by their
[2145.81s -> 2148.72s]  husband and father purchased
[2148.72s -> 2149.68s]  the rifle used in the
[2149.68s -> 2150.92s]  crime at his local gun
[2150.92s -> 2156.40s]  store. No, that's not what
[2156.40s -> 2157.60s]  I wanted to do. That was
[2157.60s -> 2168.87s]  that PT thing. Why? Well,
[2168.87s -> 2169.99s]  Seymour, I made it.
[2171.99s -> 2172.95s]  Superintendent Tomers.
[2172.95s -> 2174.07s]  Welcome. I hope you're
[2174.07s -> 2174.75s]  prepared for an
[2174.75s -> 2175.67s]  unforgettable luncheon.
[2181.02s -> 2182.94s]  Oh, you gods. My roast is
[2182.94s -> 2193.10s]  ruined. I want let's just
[2193.14s -> 2195.78s]  I want I need snow. I
[2195.78s -> 2196.42s]  don't actually know what
[2196.42s -> 2200.15s]  here. Let's go. I'll go
[2200.19s -> 2201.87s]  tags to like they have this
[2201.87s -> 2205.31s]  all sorted out here. Motion
[2205.31s -> 2206.55s]  ambience ambience. Here we
[2206.55s -> 2212.82s]  go. Lustre winter wind.
[2213.50s -> 2231.22s]  Check this shit out. I
[2231.22s -> 2231.98s]  can't make a field.
[2234.82s -> 2239.45s]  This is just in the
[2239.45s -> 2240.29s]  background. I believe you
[2240.29s -> 2246.00s]  can make a field play
[2246.00s -> 2246.68s]  when you can disturb the
[2246.68s -> 2249.86s]  distance. Right now, this
[2249.86s -> 2250.38s]  is just going to play
[2250.38s -> 2261.75s]  completely. It's very
[2261.75s -> 2262.63s]  relaxing. It's very nice,
[2262.63s -> 2266.58s]  but we're not done. Turn
[2266.58s -> 2269.98s]  up my voice. I'm just
[2269.98s -> 2270.62s]  going to turn this shit
[2270.62s -> 2275.17s]  down. Shit. Okay, so we
[2275.81s -> 2278.24s]  and this needs to be a
[2278.24s -> 2279.08s]  little more detailed. I
[2279.08s -> 2280.16s]  don't like it. I hate it.
[2280.72s -> 2281.36s]  I'm going to delete the
[2281.36s -> 2282.28s]  whole thing. Just kidding.
[2283.83s -> 2286.19s]  Okay. Sculpt paint. No,
[2286.19s -> 2287.03s]  let's do some painting.
[2287.79s -> 2289.63s]  Let's get some more like
[2289.63s -> 2290.67s]  dirt and shit on here.
[2291.31s -> 2294.78s]  You know what I mean?
[2294.78s -> 2295.42s]  Like, let's got to be
[2295.42s -> 2296.58s]  so like, let's get some
[2296.58s -> 2300.59s]  good fleck. I want like
[2300.59s -> 2302.91s]  a 3D effect here. Let's
[2302.91s -> 2306.57s]  put the kaleidoscope on
[2307.25s -> 2308.85s]  maybe like make a
[2308.85s -> 2310.73s]  fucking single goddamn
[2310.73s -> 2313.31s]  flower right here. No,
[2313.31s -> 2313.99s]  no, no, no, no, no, no.
[2313.99s -> 2314.71s]  Go back to sculpting.
[2314.71s -> 2317.39s]  It's my ADHD. This is
[2317.39s -> 2318.27s]  why I can't play these
[2318.27s -> 2322.69s]  games. This needs to be
[2322.69s -> 2323.45s]  the same color though.
[2323.89s -> 2330.13s]  And I need to blend them
[2330.13s -> 2332.96s]  together. There's a way
[2332.96s -> 2334.00s]  to do that. And I did
[2334.00s -> 2335.00s]  the tutorial and you
[2335.00s -> 2339.52s]  blend shit. You can
[2339.52s -> 2341.88s]  blend it. How I forget
[2342.68s -> 2349.99s]  not looseness, not
[2349.99s -> 2351.19s]  crop. There's a way that
[2351.19s -> 2352.71s]  you can make two things
[2352.71s -> 2354.85s]  blend in together and
[2354.85s -> 2355.93s]  can move them around
[2355.93s -> 2356.89s]  and they stick together.
[2358.79s -> 2359.87s]  It looks really, really,
[2359.87s -> 2366.76s]  really cool. I think
[2366.76s -> 2367.68s]  it's like the stamp
[2367.72s -> 2370.97s]  shape. And I think
[2370.97s -> 2371.73s]  it's like you go into
[2371.73s -> 2373.37s]  the hold on. Let me
[2373.37s -> 2374.13s]  just check this out
[2374.13s -> 2379.54s]  for a second here. Is
[2379.54s -> 2383.58s]  this it here? Like
[2383.58s -> 2385.34s]  properties, effects,
[2385.34s -> 2388.61s]  no, boil. It's not
[2388.61s -> 2390.95s]  boil. Physical
[2390.95s -> 2393.07s]  properties, movable
[2394.29s -> 2395.49s]  friction. Fuck, I
[2395.49s -> 2396.29s]  forget what it was.
[2405.12s -> 2405.92s]  Damn it. I might have
[2405.92s -> 2406.84s]  to go do that tutorial
[2406.84s -> 2412.41s]  again, because I know
[2412.41s -> 2412.93s]  there's a way that you
[2412.93s -> 2413.73s]  can make it. It looks
[2413.73s -> 2414.85s]  really, really awesome.
[2424.77s -> 2425.65s]  Ha ha ha ha. This is
[2425.65s -> 2426.33s]  it. This is it. This is
[2426.33s -> 2430.25s]  it. Varying looseness.
[2430.25s -> 2431.77s]  Yeah. Okay. This is
[2431.77s -> 2432.81s]  it. All right. I'm
[2432.81s -> 2433.73s]  ready to rock and roll.
[2433.89s -> 2434.57s]  I think it has to be on
[2434.57s -> 2435.49s]  a certain. It has to be
[2435.49s -> 2436.61s]  on stamp too as well.
[2437.01s -> 2444.47s]  You can put a hole in
[2444.47s -> 2445.75s]  it. Yeah. Okay. Okay.
[2445.75s -> 2446.27s]  I got to, I have to
[2446.27s -> 2452.68s]  do stamp. This is
[2452.68s -> 2453.28s]  pretty good rock
[2453.28s -> 2454.12s]  formation though. Okay.
[2454.12s -> 2454.60s]  I'm going to keep this
[2454.60s -> 2457.97s]  rock formation. I'm
[2457.97s -> 2458.49s]  going to clean it up
[2458.49s -> 2473.08s]  a little. I'm going to
[2473.08s -> 2473.88s]  carve this up a
[2473.88s -> 2483.22s]  little. It's just gum.
[2485.20s -> 2493.27s]  Yeah. No, that's a
[2493.27s -> 2494.07s]  pretty decent rock
[2494.07s -> 2496.97s]  formation. Okay. Just
[2497.01s -> 2528.62s]  wait. I'm going to
[2528.62s -> 2529.46s]  carve it up. Don't worry.
[2556.01s -> 2556.69s]  Pretty nice rock
[2556.69s -> 2557.61s]  formation. I would say
[2559.89s -> 2560.49s]  I got to just color
[2560.49s -> 2561.05s]  it the right color.
[2562.28s -> 2569.06s]  Okay. So let's
[2569.06s -> 2571.86s]  deselect. Yeah, guys,
[2571.86s -> 2572.66s]  guys, guys, guys.
[2572.90s -> 2574.02s]  That's, that's, that's
[2574.02s -> 2575.06s]  pretty good. Just give
[2575.06s -> 2582.34s]  me a second. I'm
[2582.34s -> 2583.42s]  going to put, Oh,
[2615.89s -> 2616.85s]  no, you bet your ass.
[2616.85s -> 2617.53s]  This is how it's going
[2617.53s -> 2620.35s]  to go. There's going
[2620.35s -> 2621.11s]  to be a fucking like
[2621.11s -> 2621.91s]  a little village right
[2621.91s -> 2629.68s]  here. And then there
[2629.68s -> 2630.40s]  you go. There's your
[2630.40s -> 2631.20s]  shot. No, no, no.
[2631.20s -> 2631.64s]  It's going to be over
[2631.64s -> 2632.90s]  here. I'll fix that
[2632.90s -> 2633.42s]  later. Here's your
[2633.42s -> 2650.76s]  shot right here. Can
[2650.76s -> 2651.64s]  be like a little fucking
[2651.64s -> 2652.36s]  farm or something
[2652.36s -> 2668.08s]  right here. Can we
[2668.08s -> 2668.52s]  think we can make a
[2668.52s -> 2669.56s]  little to scale house
[2669.56s -> 2670.99s]  over there? Right.
[2670.99s -> 2671.67s]  First of all, I need to
[2671.67s -> 2672.19s]  make these the right
[2672.19s -> 2678.14s]  color. Don't you guys
[2678.14s -> 2678.62s]  know when you, when
[2678.62s -> 2679.94s]  you scale out of any
[2679.94s -> 2681.34s]  image, it don't
[2681.34s -> 2682.78s]  matter. This is what
[2682.78s -> 2683.70s]  this is the money
[2683.70s -> 2684.42s]  right here, right
[2684.42s -> 2698.62s]  there. I'm going to
[2698.62s -> 2699.46s]  show them to shave
[2699.46s -> 2700.10s]  it. Don't worry. I'll
[2700.10s -> 2700.78s]  shave it. Just wait.
[2700.78s -> 2716.86s]  Just watch. Okay. Let's
[2716.86s -> 2717.34s]  get, let's get the
[2717.34s -> 2718.10s]  shave. Let's shave it
[2718.10s -> 2722.46s]  out. I'm going to
[2722.46s -> 2722.94s]  group these two
[2722.94s -> 2723.74s]  together because this is
[2723.74s -> 2724.10s]  where we're going to
[2724.10s -> 2726.34s]  shave. I actually
[2726.34s -> 2728.86s]  group of these, you
[2728.86s -> 2729.86s]  know, just in case
[2730.10s -> 2732.82s]  group them up. Get in
[2732.82s -> 2735.66s]  here and let's get
[2735.74s -> 2736.66s]  sculpting. What do you
[2736.66s -> 2737.38s]  say? Okay. Let's
[2737.38s -> 2737.98s]  shave this up.
[2742.52s -> 2743.40s]  It needs rounded for
[2743.40s -> 2750.10s]  this one. That's way
[2750.10s -> 2750.82s]  too much. No, I need
[2750.82s -> 2751.50s]  like the filled
[2751.50s -> 2751.98s]  doughnut. There we
[2751.98s -> 2765.57s]  go. It's like
[2765.57s -> 2766.45s]  carbon clay on a
[2766.45s -> 2771.41s]  knife. Look at
[2771.41s -> 2772.33s]  link, link, link,
[2772.33s -> 2772.93s]  link. What do you
[2772.93s -> 2773.25s]  what do you mean?
[2773.25s -> 2777.74s]  What? What?
[2787.04s -> 2788.28s]  This really is
[2788.28s -> 2790.24s]  unbelievable. That's
[2790.24s -> 2791.04s]  unfucking
[2791.04s -> 2794.00s]  unbelievable. No.
[2796.71s -> 2797.31s]  Here, I'm going to
[2797.31s -> 2797.75s]  put this on the
[2797.75s -> 2799.31s]  screen. I'm going to
[2799.31s -> 2799.63s]  put this on the
[2799.63s -> 2800.43s]  screen for a while
[2800.43s -> 2801.31s]  too. This is too
[2801.31s -> 2809.16s]  good. That should
[2809.16s -> 2810.08s]  be a new E mode.
[2810.52s -> 2812.10s]  Yeah. Yeah, it
[2812.10s -> 2812.66s]  will be. That's a
[2812.66s -> 2813.34s]  new E mode. I'm
[2813.34s -> 2813.78s]  going to literally
[2813.78s -> 2814.90s]  do that today. I'm
[2814.90s -> 2815.22s]  going to, that
[2815.22s -> 2816.10s]  will be the, that
[2816.10s -> 2816.50s]  that will be an E
[2816.50s -> 2817.02s]  mode you can use
[2817.02s -> 2823.44s]  tomorrow. Just like
[2823.44s -> 2830.50s]  that face. It really
[2830.50s -> 2831.78s]  does look like fucking
[2831.78s -> 2845.94s]  ice cream. Oh my
[2845.94s -> 2850.53s]  God. I'll, I'll
[2850.53s -> 2851.17s]  let that sit there
[2851.17s -> 2851.73s]  for a little while.
[2852.61s -> 2856.35s]  All right. It's too
[2856.35s -> 2862.42s]  harsh. I can, I
[2862.42s -> 2863.14s]  can change it in the
[2863.14s -> 2875.86s]  options later. With
[2875.86s -> 2876.58s]  the fleck tool, don't
[2876.58s -> 2877.30s]  worry. It's like,
[2877.30s -> 2878.18s]  well, it looks too
[2878.18s -> 2878.82s]  carved, looks too
[2878.82s -> 2879.62s]  perfect. I'll fuck it
[2879.62s -> 2880.34s]  all up. I'll make it
[2880.34s -> 2882.13s]  look better. All we
[2882.13s -> 2882.61s]  need is from this
[2882.61s -> 2896.06s]  side anyways. It's
[2896.06s -> 2896.94s]  really different. Give
[2896.94s -> 2917.39s]  me like a wedge. It's
[2917.39s -> 2917.95s]  still, I mean, it's
[2917.95s -> 2918.35s]  still going to look
[2918.35s -> 2918.91s]  kind of natural,
[2918.91s -> 2919.47s]  right? So that looks
[2919.47s -> 2920.35s]  a little, but when
[2920.35s -> 2921.23s]  that's, when I do
[2921.23s -> 2922.11s]  some more messing
[2922.11s -> 2922.59s]  around with fleck, it
[2922.59s -> 2922.99s]  will look a little
[2922.99s -> 2925.97s]  bit natural. Actually,
[2925.97s -> 2926.77s]  but no, no, no, no. I
[2926.77s -> 2927.49s]  want that to be
[2927.49s -> 2933.52s]  flat because I want to
[2933.52s -> 2934.00s]  put like a little
[2934.00s -> 2940.98s]  house here. That'll be
[2940.98s -> 2941.86s]  okay. I'll mess with it
[2941.86s -> 2943.46s]  in the fleck tool.
[2943.46s -> 2946.91s]  Okay. Let's see if I
[2946.91s -> 2947.71s]  was to be like up
[2947.71s -> 2959.38s]  here. This is a pretty
[2959.38s -> 2969.15s]  decent start. Okay. I
[2969.15s -> 2970.03s]  need to change this
[2970.03s -> 2970.51s]  though. We need to
[2970.51s -> 2972.67s]  mess with this. I
[2972.67s -> 2973.31s]  need to go into the
[2973.31s -> 2976.98s]  paint tool and I
[2976.98s -> 2978.34s]  want to make, I need
[2978.34s -> 2979.62s]  to make a, like a
[2979.62s -> 2980.58s]  cactus or something. I
[2980.58s -> 2983.92s]  don't know. We'll go
[2983.92s -> 2989.41s]  with, I got to get
[2989.41s -> 2990.69s]  the snap off, take the
[2990.69s -> 2991.81s]  snap into surfaces off
[2991.81s -> 2992.13s]  because I'm just going
[2992.13s -> 2993.01s]  to make something to
[2993.01s -> 2993.89s]  use in the scene.
[2993.89s -> 2994.29s]  All right. I'm going
[2994.29s -> 2995.49s]  to make a, um, I
[2995.49s -> 2995.89s]  don't know. What's
[2995.89s -> 2996.69s]  your, throw me some,
[2996.69s -> 2997.41s]  give me an idea. A
[2997.41s -> 2999.01s]  rock. All right. Good.
[2999.01s -> 3002.29s]  I'll do a rock. No,
[3002.29s -> 3003.01s]  I already have a bunch
[3003.01s -> 3004.90s]  of rocks. I'm going
[3004.90s -> 3006.02s]  to make a cactus, a
[3006.02s -> 3007.22s]  pine tree. All right.
[3007.22s -> 3007.94s]  I'll do a pine tree,
[3007.94s -> 3008.58s]  but why would a pine
[3008.58s -> 3013.20s]  tree be out here? All
[3013.20s -> 3014.24s]  right. Pine tree. I
[3014.24s -> 3014.80s]  don't know what a pine
[3014.80s -> 3015.44s]  tree looks like. I'll
[3015.44s -> 3017.36s]  try. Okay. Pine
[3017.36s -> 3019.82s]  tree. Let's go. We
[3019.82s -> 3020.70s]  need like a straight
[3020.70s -> 3021.66s]  line here. We need like
[3021.66s -> 3039.06s]  a draw fleck. What the
[3039.06s -> 3039.94s]  fuck does a pine tree
[3039.94s -> 3041.14s]  look like? I know it's
[3041.14s -> 3041.94s]  going to get brown.
[3043.14s -> 3047.81s]  It's like a brown
[3047.81s -> 3054.16s]  base, right? That
[3054.16s -> 3054.80s]  doesn't look brown.
[3055.44s -> 3057.74s]  Oh, I still have the
[3057.74s -> 3058.62s]  hexagon tool on.
[3059.58s -> 3061.87s]  Kaleidoscope is still
[3061.87s -> 3066.70s]  on. Okay. And they
[3066.70s -> 3068.62s]  are pretty waxy.
[3068.62s -> 3071.10s]  That's fine. We'll go
[3071.10s -> 3080.00s]  with this, this. The
[3080.00s -> 3086.70s]  lighting is weird. I'm
[3086.70s -> 3087.34s]  going to have to do it
[3087.34s -> 3089.50s]  like this. I don't like
[3089.50s -> 3090.38s]  that tool. I don't like
[3090.38s -> 3091.10s]  this one. It's
[3091.10s -> 3091.98s]  definitely not this one.
[3093.50s -> 3100.34s]  Banes. We could make
[3100.34s -> 3101.70s]  a tree out of this. It's
[3101.70s -> 3102.18s]  going to make it
[3102.18s -> 3109.36s]  smaller. Okay. Hold
[3109.36s -> 3117.90s]  on. Expressive
[3117.90s -> 3130.91s]  Impressionist. It's
[3130.91s -> 3132.03s]  scattered around
[3132.03s -> 3137.60s]  everywhere. Change the
[3137.60s -> 3139.04s]  bootleg elevator music.
[3139.84s -> 3140.48s]  What are you talking
[3140.48s -> 3142.00s]  about? I feel like
[3142.00s -> 3142.64s]  I should just do it
[3142.64s -> 3146.94s]  like this. Just like
[3146.94s -> 3147.82s]  paint it up and then
[3147.82s -> 3148.94s]  add. No, that's too
[3148.94s -> 3152.86s]  that's ugly. Go back
[3152.86s -> 3153.50s]  to the paint tool.
[3154.54s -> 3160.46s]  Close, please. I just
[3160.46s -> 3162.38s]  get, I'm so, ah, this
[3162.38s -> 3163.34s]  is so many options,
[3163.34s -> 3164.30s]  so many things to do.
[3165.50s -> 3168.96s]  Hide everything else.
[3168.96s -> 3171.42s]  Um, I know
[3171.42s -> 3172.22s]  there are other things
[3172.22s -> 3173.74s]  to do. Just lost in
[3173.74s -> 3174.70s]  the tutorials in my
[3174.70s -> 3177.79s]  brain. I know. Okay.
[3177.79s -> 3179.31s]  Let's do kaleidoscope.
[3180.51s -> 3185.79s]  We'll do three. Let's
[3185.79s -> 3187.07s]  just try this with
[3187.07s -> 3189.79s]  the color. Just go
[3189.79s -> 3192.67s]  brown and I'm going
[3192.67s -> 3193.95s]  to make it so it's the
[3194.91s -> 3197.71s]  draw. See that's as
[3197.71s -> 3198.59s]  big as it's going to get.
[3199.39s -> 3203.44s]  Okay, so let's just try
[3203.44s -> 3204.08s]  to make a trunk.
[3204.64s -> 3241.02s]  All right. Looks like
[3241.02s -> 3242.14s]  a giant Jenga tower,
[3242.14s -> 3250.35s]  but that's okay because
[3250.35s -> 3251.71s]  then it sprays out a
[3251.71s -> 3252.75s]  little. No, maybe not
[3252.75s -> 3253.63s]  all the way. That's
[3253.63s -> 3278.78s]  all right. Oh, it's
[3278.78s -> 3282.00s]  a palm tree. No, I
[3282.00s -> 3282.88s]  need to have roots
[3282.88s -> 3285.17s]  down here. They got
[3285.17s -> 3286.37s]  to be good roots. No,
[3286.37s -> 3287.17s]  okay. Wait, wait, wait,
[3287.17s -> 3290.93s]  wait, wait, wait. We're
[3290.93s -> 3291.65s]  going to do just kind
[3291.65s -> 3292.45s]  of random color in the
[3292.45s -> 3294.85s]  bottom there and different
[3294.85s -> 3307.79s]  black cubist. I like
[3307.79s -> 3321.46s]  it. I like it. Just
[3321.46s -> 3322.34s]  let's just see. Don't
[3322.34s -> 3323.06s]  just wait. Let's just
[3323.06s -> 3377.87s]  see what it's it's
[3377.87s -> 3391.65s]  expressionist. Oh, it's
[3391.65s -> 3392.61s]  too quiet. Sorry.
[3393.33s -> 3394.29s]  What does it express?
[3394.29s -> 3394.85s]  I don't know. It's just
[3394.85s -> 3395.73s]  like a broad paint
[3395.73s -> 3396.93s]  stroke. All right. Stop,
[3396.93s -> 3397.57s]  stop, stop, stop, stop,
[3397.57s -> 3398.29s]  stop, stop, stop, stop.
[3398.29s -> 3399.09s]  Wait, wait, leave me
[3399.09s -> 3399.97s]  alone. Leave me alone.
[3400.77s -> 3402.46s]  Okay. This is done.
[3404.18s -> 3404.74s]  We're going to start
[3404.74s -> 3407.17s]  a new painting. Wait,
[3407.17s -> 3408.69s]  is it there? Okay.
[3408.69s -> 3410.54s]  Okay. Now we're
[3410.54s -> 3411.74s]  going to do the top.
[3412.38s -> 3413.10s]  This is where we get to
[3413.18s -> 3414.30s]  be really, really,
[3414.30s -> 3415.74s]  really fun. Okay.
[3415.74s -> 3416.38s]  We're going to go with
[3416.38s -> 3419.26s]  veins. Check this out.
[3419.26s -> 3419.90s]  Ready? Get rid of the
[3419.90s -> 3424.74s]  hexagon. Let's turn this
[3424.74s -> 3428.83s]  like this. Let's just see
[3428.83s -> 3429.47s]  what that looks like
[3429.47s -> 3449.63s]  painting it. Don't let
[3449.63s -> 3450.43s]  anybody tell you that
[3450.43s -> 3451.63s]  you're doing it wrong.
[3451.63s -> 3471.62s]  I think it could work.
[3476.32s -> 3477.36s]  No, they're not
[3477.36s -> 3479.68s]  fucking pubes. No.
[3480.48s -> 3481.28s]  All right. Hold on.
[3482.24s -> 3483.49s]  Let me just see what
[3483.49s -> 3484.69s]  they look like. Edit
[3484.69s -> 3489.23s]  Fleck. Like I like
[3489.23s -> 3491.06s]  the scatter. Bring
[3491.06s -> 3492.02s]  the opacity down a
[3492.02s -> 3492.66s]  little. Okay.
[3493.46s -> 3494.02s]  You can make like an
[3494.02s -> 3495.06s]  expression, just bird.
[3495.06s -> 3495.86s]  You can do whatever you want.
[3496.98s -> 3497.94s]  These need to be smaller.
[3498.90s -> 3499.86s]  And they also need to be green.
[3503.38s -> 3504.42s]  Pine tree is like
[3504.42s -> 3505.38s]  super green. Well,
[3505.38s -> 3506.26s]  I'll do the whole
[3506.26s -> 3507.78s]  spectrum here. Okay.
[3508.34s -> 3508.82s]  Here we go.
[3510.70s -> 3512.06s]  So it just needs to be.
[3513.18s -> 3515.63s]  Let's go spin it
[3515.63s -> 3517.87s]  this way. So they go
[3517.87s -> 3519.23s]  down. And we're
[3519.23s -> 3520.11s]  going to put flow on
[3520.11s -> 3521.55s]  this too. What's flow,
[3521.55s -> 3522.35s]  Jeremy? You'll see.
[3522.35s -> 3527.31s]  Just wait. This.
[3533.81s -> 3534.61s]  I want to like move
[3534.61s -> 3535.57s]  it this way, but it's
[3535.57s -> 3537.09s]  like flying three airplanes
[3537.09s -> 3537.81s]  at the same time. For
[3537.81s -> 3539.09s]  some reason. All right.
[3539.09s -> 3540.37s]  Just tilt this way.
[3543.14s -> 3544.26s]  Why is it so difficult
[3544.26s -> 3545.30s]  to have you do good?
[3545.30s -> 3546.10s]  Go over here.
[3547.30s -> 3551.92s]  Oh, I'm killing me.
[3552.56s -> 3559.14s]  Okay. That's what I wanted.
[3559.78s -> 3561.15s]  We'll do. I'll put
[3561.15s -> 3562.27s]  me new music on in a second.
[3563.17s -> 3564.45s]  So we're talking about
[3564.45s -> 3566.13s]  pine tree. So pine tree
[3566.13s -> 3567.41s]  very sticky and prickly,
[3567.41s -> 3571.23s]  right? Who gives a fuck
[3571.23s -> 3614.06s]  it's a pine tree. Spread
[3614.06s -> 3621.25s]  out a little more and
[3621.25s -> 3622.13s]  hide everything so I can
[3622.13s -> 3623.81s]  get a good view. And
[3623.81s -> 3630.43s]  this comes out.
[3632.98s -> 3634.02s]  It's looking, it doesn't look
[3634.02s -> 3658.78s]  bad longer. I think that's
[3658.78s -> 3665.98s]  good to check the sides.
[3665.98s -> 3667.02s]  It did look. Yeah.
[3667.02s -> 3668.06s]  It's a little flat.
[3668.06s -> 3668.94s]  You have to make a little
[3668.94s -> 3669.74s]  bit bigger over here.
[3670.78s -> 3671.50s]  It was a little flat,
[3671.50s -> 3673.89s]  but it's okay because
[3673.89s -> 3674.53s]  I'm just going to come
[3674.53s -> 3675.17s]  down here.
[3678.51s -> 3683.55s]  Probably should have turned
[3683.55s -> 3684.43s]  on like the mirror tool
[3684.43s -> 3709.52s]  or something. Every tree
[3709.52s -> 3710.24s]  needs another tree.
[3710.24s -> 3711.28s]  Oh yeah. I know.
[3711.28s -> 3713.07s]  The best thing about
[3713.07s -> 3713.87s]  this game is the only
[3713.87s -> 3718.59s]  to do this once you
[3718.59s -> 3719.55s]  only have to do this.
[3719.55s -> 3723.78s]  Oops. Kind of screwed
[3723.78s -> 3736.75s]  that up. Come on.
[3738.03s -> 3739.18s]  This game is going to have
[3739.18s -> 3741.10s]  VR later. That'd be awesome.
[3744.62s -> 3745.58s]  Snapping on. I don't think
[3745.58s -> 3746.14s]  snapping's on.
[3747.82s -> 3754.61s]  Doesn't need to be perfect.
[3755.25s -> 3756.13s]  Just needs to get the
[3756.13s -> 3757.09s]  idea across because it's
[3757.09s -> 3757.73s]  going to be scaled
[3757.73s -> 3767.84s]  anyways because we're
[3767.84s -> 3768.88s]  going to put some flow
[3768.88s -> 3770.32s]  on this too. So don't
[3770.32s -> 3771.84s]  worry. We'll be good.
[3771.84s -> 3789.34s]  All right. Not. I don't
[3789.34s -> 3790.06s]  know if that's really a
[3790.06s -> 3791.26s]  pine tree. It's more like
[3791.26s -> 3793.26s]  a bush, but it's all
[3793.26s -> 3798.59s]  right. Okay. So now
[3799.31s -> 3800.88s]  put this over here.
[3800.88s -> 3802.00s]  Oh, something's wrong there.
[3802.88s -> 3805.81s]  That's all fucked up.
[3806.53s -> 3807.17s]  I'll fix it.
[3810.10s -> 3811.30s]  That's all fucked up.
[3811.30s -> 3814.08s]  That's all fucked up.
[3814.08s -> 3815.12s]  What's like the erase tool?
[3821.06s -> 3822.10s]  Shit's all fucked up.
[3822.74s -> 3823.54s]  How do I erase it?
[3825.34s -> 3826.30s]  Is there is I don't
[3826.30s -> 3826.78s]  even know if there
[3826.78s -> 3827.74s]  is an erase tool in the
[3827.74s -> 3831.04s]  game. I really don't
[3831.04s -> 3831.44s]  think there is.
[3832.00s -> 3838.66s]  Well, I'll figure it
[3838.66s -> 3839.14s]  out in a second.
[3866.69s -> 3867.49s]  Spider-Man.
[3867.49s -> 3881.04s]  How long before you guys
[3881.04s -> 3881.92s]  get rid of that one?
[3882.56s -> 3892.06s]  Is this the whole song?
[3892.06s -> 3893.84s]  Okay. Fine. We'll do this
[3893.84s -> 3898.29s]  one. Which one of these
[3898.29s -> 3899.49s]  is animal crawl?
[3899.49s -> 3899.73s]  There it is.
[3910.53s -> 3940.46s]  Sing it. You got a friend?
[3940.46s -> 3945.46s]  All right. You got a
[3945.46s -> 3946.58s]  friend in me.
[3948.70s -> 3950.54s]  You got a friend in me.
[3952.83s -> 3958.35s]  But you got a friend
[3958.35s -> 3960.51s]  inside of yourself.
[3960.51s -> 3963.15s]  But you got a friend in me.
[3981.10s -> 3982.30s]  How do I erase this?
[3984.53s -> 3985.97s]  I know you can.
[3985.97s -> 3986.85s]  Here we go. Delete.
[3987.81s -> 3990.05s]  Delete. Ah, there is
[3990.05s -> 3990.85s]  an erase tool.
[3990.85s -> 4023.38s]  Let's connect these two
[4023.38s -> 4036.74s]  together. Kind of sad,
[4036.74s -> 4037.78s]  but it's all right.
[4037.78s -> 4038.98s]  It's, I'm not done.
[4039.78s -> 4040.96s]  No, I forgot to do like
[4040.96s -> 4041.76s]  the fucking cool shit.
[4041.76s -> 4045.22s]  Hold on. The trunk is too
[4045.22s -> 4049.26s]  long. No, it's not.
[4049.26s -> 4052.86s]  Is it? I don't even know
[4052.86s -> 4054.14s]  what a pine tree looks like.
[4068.30s -> 4070.46s]  I think I have to
[4070.46s -> 4071.50s]  shave off some of this.
[4071.50s -> 4072.78s]  This is, it's too much.
[4073.50s -> 4079.95s]  This is like a willow tree.
[4079.95s -> 4080.75s]  Yeah. All right.
[4080.75s -> 4081.95s]  Let's go shave some stuff
[4081.95s -> 4088.83s]  off here. A little too long.
[4089.39s -> 4102.54s]  Take out some of the bulk
[4102.54s -> 4103.10s]  from the back.
[4110.61s -> 4112.13s]  All right. That's a little better.
[4112.13s -> 4112.85s]  And I'm going to move.
[4112.85s -> 4113.49s]  I'm going to, I'm going to
[4113.49s -> 4114.61s]  fuck with this a little bit too.
[4116.48s -> 4117.60s]  No, Jeremy, don't fuck with it.
[4117.60s -> 4118.40s]  I'm going to fuck with it.
[4121.76s -> 4123.20s]  What's flow? I'll show you.
[4124.98s -> 4126.98s]  So here is where we get
[4126.98s -> 4128.18s]  to have a little bit of fun.
[4129.87s -> 4130.51s]  I'll connect these two
[4130.51s -> 4131.15s]  together in a second.
[4131.15s -> 4132.91s]  But let's go to style mode.
[4134.08s -> 4134.64s]  All right. And this is
[4134.64s -> 4135.60s]  what we hit. Hold on.
[4136.32s -> 4152.34s]  Bring it back a little.
[4152.34s -> 4152.82s]  What do you think?
[4167.73s -> 4169.92s]  No, no, no.
[4169.92s -> 4170.80s]  It's turning into that,
[4170.80s -> 4173.04s]  that guy's hair from the meme.
[4173.04s -> 4173.76s]  What does that mean?
[4174.72s -> 4177.07s]  That's not bad.
[4179.25s -> 4179.97s]  I don't hate this.
[4194.05s -> 4194.85s]  That looks pretty good.
[4199.50s -> 4202.26s]  And then check this shit out.
[4202.26s -> 4203.14s]  The finishing touches
[4203.14s -> 4203.86s]  we're going to put on this.
[4203.86s -> 4205.14s]  You wouldn't even believe it.
[4217.98s -> 4225.94s]  Maybe a little too much.
[4225.94s -> 4226.66s]  Look at that.
[4227.60s -> 4228.80s]  It's alive.
[4231.84s -> 4232.64s]  That's all you need.
[4232.64s -> 4233.28s]  That's it.
[4233.28s -> 4234.24s]  Don't need anything else.
[4240.42s -> 4242.18s]  And okay, back it up.
[4244.45s -> 4246.53s]  Now we're going to go to style.
[4246.53s -> 4248.21s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[4248.21s -> 4250.86s]  We're going to go to coat mode,
[4252.62s -> 4256.02s]  finish, and we're going to get
[4256.02s -> 4257.22s]  some shine, more shine
[4257.22s -> 4257.86s]  on these leaves.
[4258.42s -> 4268.22s]  Look at that glistening.
[4269.02s -> 4284.53s]  More, more, no, less paint.
[4284.53s -> 4285.25s]  We can add some,
[4285.25s -> 4285.97s]  we can add like a couple
[4285.97s -> 4286.93s]  of little things here.
[4290.50s -> 4291.94s]  Tint hue glow.
[4291.94s -> 4292.82s]  Okay, maybe this is
[4292.82s -> 4296.96s]  what I want for glow.
[4296.96s -> 4297.76s]  Where's the glow?
[4297.76s -> 4298.40s]  Okay, color.
[4300.03s -> 4300.99s]  I want it to be like
[4300.99s -> 4302.43s]  baking in the sun.
[4302.43s -> 4312.99s]  A little burnt.
[4312.99s -> 4314.43s]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[4314.43s -> 4315.31s]  I'm not even glowing.
[4315.31s -> 4316.67s]  I'm not even doing glow.
[4316.67s -> 4323.23s]  Go back, apply glow.
[4323.23s -> 4323.63s]  There it is.
[4326.64s -> 4328.98s]  Whoa, too much, too much.
[4328.98s -> 4329.94s]  Back it up, back it up.
[4334.45s -> 4335.25s]  That looks good.
[4336.82s -> 4338.34s]  Now we're going to do the trunk.
[4338.34s -> 4343.01s]  Come on, you didn't think
[4343.01s -> 4346.24s]  I was going to make a good tree, did you?
[4346.24s -> 4347.36s]  You didn't think I was going to make
[4347.36s -> 4348.24s]  a decent tree.
[4348.24s -> 4349.28s]  And this is the roots are there
[4349.28s -> 4350.24s]  for a very specific green.
[4350.24s -> 4351.04s]  Watch, I'm not done.
[4351.68s -> 4358.27s]  This one, no.
[4358.27s -> 4364.30s]  We're going to change this a little bit.
[4366.34s -> 4367.30s]  I want to,
[4367.30s -> 4368.74s]  let's go into the tool menu here.
[4371.71s -> 4372.83s]  It's actually terrible.
[4373.55s -> 4374.27s]  All right, I'm turning on
[4374.27s -> 4375.95s]  the ice cream going on.
[4380.96s -> 4385.14s]  Hold on a second.
[4385.14s -> 4385.86s]  Hold on a second.
[4385.86s -> 4386.66s]  Hold on, hold on.
[4413.90s -> 4415.18s]  No, this was checking.
[4415.18s -> 4415.90s]  I just wanted to know.
[4415.90s -> 4417.10s]  Just was curious to see what it looked like.
[4417.90s -> 4418.78s]  We're going to make this
[4418.78s -> 4419.42s]  a little smoother.
[4419.42s -> 4420.22s]  We're going to ruffle
[4420.22s -> 4421.58s]  the black up a little bit.
[4422.30s -> 4425.44s]  So let's go ahead and do that now.
[4426.16s -> 4431.90s]  Color is fine.
[4431.90s -> 4432.78s]  The finish is fine.
[4432.78s -> 4433.50s]  Tint is fine.
[4433.50s -> 4435.02s]  Actually, I want it to be a little lighter.
[4438.22s -> 4440.38s]  Let's go to from here to here.
[4440.38s -> 4442.38s]  Let's see if we can make this a little lighter.
[4446.42s -> 4447.06s]  There we go.
[4448.19s -> 4449.95s]  That's more of like a wood look.
[4450.67s -> 4452.64s]  Don't you just want to take
[4452.64s -> 4453.36s]  these little wood chips
[4453.36s -> 4454.24s]  and just chew them up?
[4454.24s -> 4454.56s]  I do.
[4455.20s -> 4458.93s]  Okay, back it up into,
[4458.93s -> 4460.53s]  we don't need any effects on this one.
[4460.53s -> 4463.33s]  We just need to loosen it up a little.
[4464.13s -> 4470.85s]  Mmm.
[4470.85s -> 4471.73s]  Actually tighten it up.
[4480.70s -> 4485.31s]  It's already tight enough already.
[4496.66s -> 4497.38s]  I don't hate that.
[4505.18s -> 4505.82s]  I don't hate that.
[4508.94s -> 4510.14s]  Yeah, it's a little crooked,
[4510.14s -> 4510.70s]  but it's okay.
[4522.02s -> 4522.74s]  There we go.
[4525.42s -> 4526.94s]  Now it's wood.
[4526.94s -> 4528.30s]  It's square like wood.
[4528.30s -> 4529.42s]  Now let's hold on.
[4532.90s -> 4533.94s]  I'll fix it.
[4533.94s -> 4535.14s]  I'll make it straight.
[4535.78s -> 4552.77s]  Too big.
[4552.77s -> 4553.97s]  Top needs to be shaved a little.
[4559.01s -> 4561.66s]  Now this is what we're going to do here.
[4563.97s -> 4564.47s]  Oops.
[4565.01s -> 4571.41s]  That needs to be way smothered.
[4571.41s -> 4573.49s]  I just combed all the flecks like down.
[4575.17s -> 4575.73s]  Never mind.
[4576.93s -> 4577.73s]  Nope.
[4577.73s -> 4589.04s]  Now it's just turning into sheet metal.
[4590.35s -> 4591.79s]  No, tight flecks are fine.
[4592.43s -> 4593.79s]  That looks more like a trunk.
[4599.86s -> 4602.27s]  Okay, let's stick this over here
[4602.27s -> 4602.91s]  and combine them.
[4603.47s -> 4607.33s]  I think we're good one.
[4607.33s -> 4607.97s]  Tint.
[4607.97s -> 4609.49s]  We don't need any effects on here.
[4610.29s -> 4612.00s]  Unless I want to add,
[4612.72s -> 4614.10s]  all right, let me straighten it.
[4614.66s -> 4622.85s]  I don't think this ever can be straight.
[4623.57s -> 4627.57s]  Is this like an optical illusion?
[4627.57s -> 4628.77s]  How do I make this straight?
[4637.23s -> 4637.87s]  Oh, come on.
[4639.38s -> 4639.88s]  What?
[4648.63s -> 4649.19s]  What?
[4649.19s -> 4650.71s]  This is an optical illusion.
[4651.35s -> 4660.37s]  It don't matter.
[4660.37s -> 4661.65s]  All right, we're going to just combine it.
[4664.77s -> 4665.89s]  Make sure it's in the right spot.
[4666.53s -> 4674.02s]  I almost think the bottom
[4674.02s -> 4675.38s]  should be frayed out a little more.
[4675.38s -> 4675.94s]  Don't you think?
[4683.28s -> 4686.37s]  I think so.
[4687.09s -> 4714.93s]  Maybe a little bit higher.
[4715.73s -> 4730.63s]  I think that's it.
[4730.63s -> 4731.35s]  I think we got it.
[4732.15s -> 4740.10s]  Perfect.
[4740.10s -> 4740.34s]  Done.
[4740.90s -> 4745.75s]  Why are you spending two hours making a tree?
[4747.67s -> 4748.15s]  Why not?
[4752.82s -> 4753.38s]  Why not?
[4753.38s -> 4754.90s]  It's fun.
[4756.87s -> 4758.71s]  I think you're describing this whole game.
[4759.27s -> 4760.15s]  That's the whole game.
[4762.02s -> 4762.90s]  All right, that's it.
[4764.55s -> 4765.19s]  Here's the tree.
[4767.78s -> 4768.98s]  So that two hours.
[4769.78s -> 4771.06s]  I haven't even lived for two hours.
[4771.06s -> 4773.14s]  What are you talking about?
[4773.14s -> 4773.94s]  All right, so that's good.
[4773.94s -> 4774.50s]  Where's that going to go?
[4776.90s -> 4777.86s]  Here's the beauty of this.
[4796.10s -> 4800.26s]  And I can go in and change these two.
[4800.26s -> 4801.46s]  They're all identical.
[4801.46s -> 4802.50s]  Don't you worry about that?
[4802.50s -> 4804.02s]  You don't think I fucking thought about that?
[4806.58s -> 4807.62s]  You don't think I thought about that?
[4811.94s -> 4812.50s]  Don't worry.
[4816.74s -> 4818.10s]  Because these are all grouped,
[4818.10s -> 4818.82s]  I can go in
[4819.54s -> 4821.14s]  and watch ready.
[4821.86s -> 4822.82s]  Just change this one.
[4823.38s -> 4824.98s]  So let's select this one.
[4824.98s -> 4826.56s]  Let's like go into it.
[4827.36s -> 4829.12s]  And then see how I have both of these.
[4829.12s -> 4831.84s]  Now, go ahead and pull up that menu we had before.
[4832.72s -> 4834.96s]  The style menu.
[4835.84s -> 4836.48s]  Loosen it up.
[4837.44s -> 4840.20s]  Ruffle some feathers a little bit.
[4841.00s -> 4847.01s]  Can even add some to it.
[4848.60s -> 4850.20s]  And that's done.
[4850.20s -> 4850.60s]  Different.
[4850.60s -> 4853.24s]  Now I can copy this one if I really so desire.
[4863.70s -> 4864.02s]  Oops.
[4877.78s -> 4878.90s]  I can't tell the difference.
[4878.90s -> 4881.06s]  Well, look, if I really wanted to spend time,
[4881.06s -> 4881.86s]  I could do this.
[4882.82s -> 4884.66s]  You really want me to do this again?
[4884.66s -> 4887.03s]  Because this is how I do it.
[4887.03s -> 4890.96s]  Look, I make another watch.
[4890.96s -> 4891.92s]  You want me to do it again?
[4892.48s -> 4895.17s]  Because I already have an object there now
[4895.17s -> 4895.89s]  that's ready to go.
[4895.89s -> 4898.69s]  And I could make like two or three more tree leaves.
[4898.69s -> 4902.66s]  I'm going to make, no, no, no.
[4923.04s -> 4924.80s]  Look, this is just for the like, oops.
[4925.60s -> 4930.42s]  I don't even want those there.
[4930.98s -> 4936.77s]  No, okay, get rid of these two
[4936.77s -> 4937.73s]  because these two are different.
[4941.28s -> 4942.56s]  These, and they flow too.
[4942.56s -> 4943.12s]  All right.
[4943.12s -> 4945.28s]  First of all, this, we're going to change this to stone.
[4945.28s -> 4946.00s]  It's freaking me out.
[4947.60s -> 4953.11s]  Oops, that was just, that was the ambient sound.
[4953.11s -> 4954.79s]  I thought that was fucking, you got a friend in me.
[4958.24s -> 4960.88s]  You got a friend in me.
[4960.88s -> 4961.28s]  All right.
[4962.00s -> 4965.86s]  Now I'm going to RIP Fleshy Ground.
[4965.86s -> 4967.14s]  No, we can't just have the ground
[4967.14s -> 4968.50s]  be looking like that this whole time.
[4973.73s -> 4980.55s]  I need, I need to animate this.
[4980.55s -> 4981.75s]  Okay, let's get to the beginning.
[4982.39s -> 4995.20s]  Okay, let's see how that looks.
[4996.40s -> 4999.76s]  It looks good.
[5011.22s -> 5012.74s]  I'm going to make a cubert.
[5012.74s -> 5014.18s]  Oh, I want to make cubert now.
[5014.18s -> 5015.70s]  I want to make a cubert level.
[5015.70s -> 5016.98s]  No, no, no, focus first.
[5016.98s -> 5018.50s]  Focus, focus, focus, focus, focus.
[5019.14s -> 5027.75s]  So this is what it looks like alive, living scene.
[5028.55s -> 5031.11s]  And I'm going to like make this look fucking sick.
[5031.11s -> 5031.75s]  I can't wait.
[5031.75s -> 5035.48s]  All right, let's change this
[5035.48s -> 5037.32s]  because this is, I'm going to put something here.
[5039.75s -> 5040.79s]  Do cubert or RIP.
[5040.79s -> 5042.07s]  We'll make cubert at the end.
[5042.07s -> 5043.27s]  You can just hang out on top of the mountain.
[5043.27s -> 5045.35s]  I could redo that, the smoking shit up there too.
[5045.99s -> 5051.24s]  All right, so this and I'm going to make it to the level.
[5051.24s -> 5052.28s]  It's going to be a platform level
[5052.28s -> 5053.16s]  to get to the top of the mountain.
[5053.16s -> 5055.24s]  Just I'm biting off way more than I can chew.
[5055.24s -> 5066.28s]  Okay, I need, I need to go to the coat tint
[5067.08s -> 5073.48s]  and we need to make this shit not skin like flesh color.
[5075.91s -> 5077.03s]  What color do I want?
[5080.18s -> 5083.57s]  Maybe they could be like a little blue.
[5084.13s -> 5085.09s]  Like kind of like this.
[5086.05s -> 5087.01s]  It's supposed to be snowy.
[5087.73s -> 5092.92s]  It could be like cold and snowy and shit.
[5093.72s -> 5103.72s]  Let's try this one.
[5104.44s -> 5127.75s]  It's like ice.
[5127.75s -> 5128.47s]  All right, hold on.
[5129.59s -> 5131.44s]  Let's bring it back a little.
[5131.44s -> 5133.04s]  I need to, this needs to be flatter.
[5138.37s -> 5138.85s]  That's good.
[5140.44s -> 5141.16s]  You know what?
[5141.16s -> 5141.48s]  Fuck it.
[5141.48s -> 5159.16s]  Let's, now that makes more sense.
[5161.28s -> 5163.60s]  Now let me go back into style mode
[5163.60s -> 5165.60s]  and let's change this, make it look a little better.
[5165.60s -> 5166.48s]  This looks like shit.
[5173.19s -> 5176.02s]  That looks way worse.
[5213.83s -> 5214.71s]  No, it's going to be flat.
[5219.76s -> 5221.20s]  Let's flatten this out.
[5221.20s -> 5223.44s]  And I'm going to, I think I'm going to apply some fleck here.
[5230.76s -> 5232.36s]  Yeah, we're going to apply a little fleck
[5233.00s -> 5234.20s]  and it's going to be the square.
[5234.20s -> 5246.04s]  Let's see, is that doing anything?
[5247.30s -> 5248.34s]  I don't think it's doing anything.
[5252.80s -> 5253.76s]  I feel like I should just,
[5254.72s -> 5257.96s]  how did I fuck that up in the first place?
[5259.00s -> 5259.88s]  This, you know what I mean?
[5261.01s -> 5261.81s]  Why is it like that?
[5263.01s -> 5264.53s]  I think I have to, yeah, it was in here.
[5266.20s -> 5273.16s]  Right, yeah, looseness, looseness and varying looseness.
[5273.88s -> 5280.31s]  It's kind of irredeemable at the moment though.
[5281.19s -> 5286.77s]  Wait, what are you doing?
[5286.77s -> 5295.35s]  Hey, hey, I don't want to put a circle here.
[5295.35s -> 5295.91s]  What are you doing?
[5298.98s -> 5300.10s]  I want to edit this.
[5300.10s -> 5305.30s]  Wait a second.
[5305.30s -> 5306.04s]  There we go.
[5306.04s -> 5320.00s]  I'm confused.
[5320.00s -> 5320.64s]  Why is it not,
[5321.28s -> 5330.96s]  shouldn't I be able just to edit this one?
[5331.76s -> 5335.01s]  Because that's what it looks like I'm doing.
[5335.57s -> 5340.02s]  Is there a reason why I can't change that back
[5340.02s -> 5341.30s]  or am I changing it back?
[5344.87s -> 5347.19s]  Is it happening and I just don't, I'm just dumb?
[5347.83s -> 5349.35s]  No, see, it's happening to that one.
[5349.35s -> 5349.91s]  See what I'm saying?
[5351.59s -> 5353.51s]  Shouldn't that be doing the smoothness on this one too?
[5354.15s -> 5359.40s]  Oh, it's because I need to be on the stamp tool.
[5359.40s -> 5360.12s]  Right, right, right.
[5360.12s -> 5363.08s]  Okay, I will forget that a bunch of times.
[5363.08s -> 5363.56s]  Don't worry.
[5371.68s -> 5373.04s]  Stamp, there it is.
[5373.04s -> 5377.48s]  Okay, now I can go in and make this smoother.
[5378.44s -> 5380.21s]  Technically, right, should I?
[5382.82s -> 5388.84s]  Wait, why is this not working?
[5401.86s -> 5404.02s]  I don't understand why I can't change the properties here.
[5411.62s -> 5412.98s]  I have no idea why.
[5412.98s -> 5414.42s]  I have absolutely no clue
[5418.13s -> 5420.77s]  because it's making me change this one.
[5421.33s -> 5444.04s]  Put it inside the other shape and just combine them.
[5445.00s -> 5447.03s]  I guess I could do that.
[5447.03s -> 5448.87s]  I feel like there's an easier way to do it though.
[5449.51s -> 5456.82s]  Okay, now edit shape.
[5456.82s -> 5464.07s]  No, maybe it is affecting it.
[5464.63s -> 5468.05s]  No, it's not.
[5468.61s -> 5473.76s]  Well, unfortunately, I have no idea.
[5475.62s -> 5476.58s]  I have no clue.
[5477.70s -> 5479.70s]  I'm gonna have to go back and watch tutorials again
[5479.70s -> 5486.08s]  because I don't have a single fucking clue.
[5486.08s -> 5489.36s]  I changed it before and now I can't change it back
[5490.24s -> 5490.96s]  for some reason.
[5494.18s -> 5495.62s]  Mmm, oh well.
[5495.62s -> 5498.68s]  Am I scoped in?
[5498.68s -> 5500.20s]  Yo, yeah, I am now.
[5502.36s -> 5504.12s]  Like I was here, I'm scoped in again.
[5505.49s -> 5506.53s]  Is it because they grouped?
[5508.39s -> 5517.65s]  See, like, maybe just edit the object outside of sculpt mode.
[5517.65s -> 5520.55s]  Um, edit sculpture.
[5520.55s -> 5521.43s]  Will this work now?
[5522.15s -> 5529.80s]  I don't think so.
[5532.56s -> 5534.00s]  It looks like it's doing something but
[5534.72s -> 5537.52s]  maybe I just fucked it up too much that it can't do it anymore.
[5540.61s -> 5542.05s]  I guess it is doing it.
[5546.32s -> 5546.88s]  Yeah, it is.
[5547.52s -> 5551.14s]  I think I just screwed with it too much.
[5551.78s -> 5552.74s]  Oh well.
[5553.54s -> 5557.14s]  It's editing the tool that I'm using.
[5557.14s -> 5559.94s]  Yeah, but is there no way for me to revert this back to
[5560.66s -> 5561.70s]  the way that it was before?
[5562.42s -> 5563.75s]  It's all right.
[5564.39s -> 5568.60s]  Let's keep going.
[5569.16s -> 5570.64s]  All right, what's next?
[5575.88s -> 5585.17s]  L1 plus square, invisible, movable, collision labels, audio.
[5585.97s -> 5588.61s]  No, maybe, hold on.
[5588.61s -> 5590.21s]  Scope in and then L1 square.
[5591.01s -> 5592.21s]  All right, hold on a second here.
[5593.17s -> 5593.89s]  Tint amount.
[5595.40s -> 5596.28s]  Shine and, all right, hold on.
[5596.28s -> 5598.36s]  This is the actual, like, menu menu of this thing.
[5599.96s -> 5601.16s]  Waxiness, metalness.
[5601.72s -> 5602.04s]  Okay.
[5605.25s -> 5605.81s]  Roughness.
[5608.20s -> 5609.00s]  That looks kind of cool.
[5609.80s -> 5611.75s]  Hue cycle.
[5612.31s -> 5613.99s]  I feel like I don't want to screw with this.
[5614.71s -> 5619.92s]  This is the fleck properties.
[5620.72s -> 5626.10s]  I don't think this is going to work.
[5626.10s -> 5626.98s]  Looseness.
[5626.98s -> 5628.02s]  Fleck perspective.
[5628.02s -> 5628.52s]  Whoa!
[5635.49s -> 5638.77s]  Yeah, I have to have, like, big flecks that I can't really shrink.
[5643.65s -> 5644.29s]  Flex, no.
[5647.46s -> 5647.94s]  Friction.
[5649.00s -> 5655.54s]  No, I feel like I may have gone too far on it.
[5656.18s -> 5656.90s]  It's possible.
[5657.70s -> 5663.25s]  I can change the, I'll make it a little different.
[5665.35s -> 5666.39s]  Waxiness.
[5666.39s -> 5667.43s]  Yeah, it's all good.
[5669.14s -> 5669.78s]  It's all good.
[5670.58s -> 5672.60s]  That looks all right.
[5672.60s -> 5673.16s]  It looks fine.
[5673.72s -> 5679.56s]  It just looks like it's made out of puff pastry or paper mache.
[5679.56s -> 5681.24s]  But that's fine.
[5681.80s -> 5683.20s]  I'm just playing around.
[5686.44s -> 5689.99s]  All right, what's next?
[5689.99s -> 5696.87s]  This next part is, I kind of want to fix this.
[5696.87s -> 5701.48s]  And I want to change that to webcam demands.
[5701.48s -> 5704.04s]  I'm just, honestly, I'm just trying to focus.
[5705.20s -> 5708.56s]  So I haven't really been looking at chat that much because
[5709.36s -> 5711.78s]  I've been trying to focus on making trees.
[5711.78s -> 5713.30s]  And that's a pretty damn good tree.
[5715.72s -> 5717.24s]  But no, I'm not going to put on a webcam.
[5717.24s -> 5718.28s]  Why would I put a webcam on?
[5722.16s -> 5724.80s]  No, you want to see the beauty of the mountains, not me.
[5726.29s -> 5727.97s]  All right, let's go into.
[5728.93s -> 5736.56s]  Now, unfortunately, I made, I said I wanted this to be a sculpture.
[5736.56s -> 5738.56s]  So I didn't say I wanted this to be a video game.
[5739.12s -> 5741.68s]  Does anybody know if does that matter?
[5741.68s -> 5747.40s]  Or can I make this a platformer starting like over here and make it over here?
[5748.04s -> 5751.17s]  No, it doesn't matter.
[5751.17s -> 5751.49s]  Okay.
[5752.21s -> 5754.61s]  Well, let's do what I was going to do in the first place.
[5754.61s -> 5757.49s]  And let's just put these trees in different places.
[5758.37s -> 5773.44s]  And yes, they all look the same.
[5774.08s -> 5774.80s]  But you know what?
[5775.44s -> 5777.33s]  I don't got time.
[5777.97s -> 5780.26s]  I don't got time to care about that.
[5781.06s -> 5801.70s]  Because once you do this, it almost doesn't matter.
[5801.70s -> 5802.50s]  But I did.
[5805.67s -> 5806.07s]  Nope.
[5806.71s -> 5811.24s]  Nice grass.
[5811.24s -> 5813.16s]  Yeah, I should probably put grass here first.
[5814.12s -> 5817.09s]  And this isn't even big enough to have that tree here.
[5819.27s -> 5820.39s]  Now it should be fine.
[5820.39s -> 5821.35s]  Let's go like this.
[5829.86s -> 5832.28s]  That should do it.
[5833.00s -> 5839.01s]  Now, what does that look like?
[5839.01s -> 5839.73s]  That looks better.
[5840.45s -> 5849.48s]  This looks stupid.
[5852.42s -> 5854.34s]  That doesn't look like it belongs anywhere over here.
[5854.90s -> 5859.08s]  Let's just go like that.
[5859.72s -> 5864.76s]  And this needs to be changed.
[5865.48s -> 5868.31s]  I need to get in here.
[5869.03s -> 5879.91s]  Because that's just sort of sticking out.
[5880.87s -> 5885.06s]  It looks bad.
[5885.06s -> 5885.78s]  Make it bigger.
[5892.92s -> 5893.16s]  Yeah.
[5894.74s -> 5895.46s]  Yeah.
[5895.46s -> 5902.98s]  Oh, well, I can add a couple later anyways.
[5902.98s -> 5904.74s]  Let's get some grass here.
[5905.30s -> 5907.16s]  Back to the paint tool.
[5909.46s -> 5912.26s]  And I would say what looks the most like grass.
[5916.29s -> 5919.72s]  That's not terrible.
[5920.36s -> 5931.70s]  Do you know you don't own a single thing in the game?
[5931.70s -> 5937.09s]  What do you mean?
[5937.09s -> 5939.89s]  That's grassy.
[5939.89s -> 5941.17s]  That's good grassy.
[5941.89s -> 5944.85s]  Oh, yeah.
[5944.85s -> 5945.17s]  Okay.
[5945.17s -> 5945.97s]  Let's get some grass.
[5946.77s -> 5947.41s]  What do you mean?
[5947.41s -> 5948.13s]  You don't own it?
[5948.69s -> 5954.00s]  Or is it one of those scenarios where a media molecule owns the rights?
[5954.00s -> 5957.76s]  Well, I guess you have to sign that EULA, right?
[5957.76s -> 5958.40s]  Or whatever it is.
[5959.28s -> 5969.86s]  All right.
[5969.86s -> 5970.82s]  This is grass.
[5971.62s -> 5980.00s]  I'm going to do a fun thing called copy this 5,000 times.
[5986.12s -> 5988.28s]  They're going to start producing the popsicle.
[5989.00s -> 5993.89s]  I just make somebody eating a popsicle next.
[5995.49s -> 5996.21s]  God damn it.
[5998.90s -> 5999.22s]  Why?
[6005.96s -> 6006.92s]  Well, whatever.
[6006.92s -> 6009.60s]  Just going to do it like this anyways.
[6017.62s -> 6018.82s]  I'm just going to paint it on there.
[6018.82s -> 6020.10s]  Why make an object?
[6020.10s -> 6021.38s]  There's no reason to even do that.
[6021.94s -> 6024.50s]  I'm just going to paint it to the surface and call it a day.
[6029.12s -> 6030.00s]  Brush is fine.
[6030.96s -> 6031.76s]  Surface snap.
[6034.48s -> 6034.80s]  Yeah.
[6034.80s -> 6035.12s]  Fuck it.
[6035.12s -> 6036.08s]  Let's just paint it on here.
[6036.88s -> 6041.88s]  Give me the green.
[6044.71s -> 6045.67s]  And it was, which one was it?
[6045.67s -> 6046.23s]  This one, right?
[6049.19s -> 6050.39s]  Straight up, maybe?
[6050.39s -> 6052.18s]  Yeah, that's fine.
[6052.82s -> 6062.66s]  That's fine.
[6062.66s -> 6068.18s]  Once we get it painted in here, we can mess with the fleck and it'll look like grass.
[6075.44s -> 6076.48s]  Chat's bored.
[6076.48s -> 6079.36s]  Well, I did tell you what I was going to be doing today.
[6079.36s -> 6082.32s]  I did make it very clear that I was going to just be playing dreams
[6082.32s -> 6084.08s]  and sculpting random stuff and learning.
[6085.14s -> 6086.26s]  I did say that.
[6089.72s -> 6091.00s]  You promised Sam and Max.
[6091.80s -> 6093.24s]  On Friday.
[6093.24s -> 6095.28s]  Today's not Friday.
[6097.00s -> 6109.44s]  Check your calendar.
[6109.44s -> 6110.88s]  Do the whole stream like that.
[6117.24s -> 6118.76s]  You said you're playing other people's maps.
[6118.76s -> 6119.88s]  Well, here's the thing.
[6119.88s -> 6123.32s]  Nobody made any.
[6123.32s -> 6125.89s]  So that happened.
[6128.05s -> 6131.88s]  There are no maps with the title German.
[6131.88s -> 6134.52s]  Unless somebody made one and I don't know about it.
[6137.62s -> 6140.98s]  I've said for the last like week that I was going to be playing dreams today.
[6141.70s -> 6156.71s]  And that's what we're doing because I like want to learn how to play it.
[6156.71s -> 6161.08s]  Look, I can't make anything unless I learn how to play.
[6161.08s -> 6163.08s]  And I can't learn how to play unless I play.
[6163.08s -> 6167.48s]  And I can't not stream it because I stream three or four days a week.
[6167.48s -> 6169.49s]  So I have to play it.
[6169.49s -> 6171.25s]  Otherwise, I'm never going to make anything.
[6171.25s -> 6178.31s]  All right, let's see how this looks.
[6178.31s -> 6190.50s]  There's only like five new games since the first stream.
[6192.76s -> 6193.40s]  Well, it is.
[6194.39s -> 6195.75s]  Here's something I will say, right?
[6198.07s -> 6204.55s]  This game asks a lot out of the player.
[6204.55s -> 6208.63s]  It's very, very much a full video game engine.
[6208.63s -> 6210.71s]  When you have like 10 hours of tutorials,
[6213.09s -> 6221.24s]  you're expecting somebody's going to want to do it, right?
[6221.24s -> 6226.53s]  And this game has been sort of in development
[6227.99s -> 6231.67s]  for a very, it's been sitting in development for like what, five, six years?
[6233.73s -> 6238.45s]  Maybe they've been desperately trying to figure out how to make the game appealing to people
[6239.09s -> 6242.45s]  without requiring them to play for like 150 hours to do anything.
[6243.17s -> 6245.25s]  But you kind of have to do that.
[6247.62s -> 6253.60s]  It's an amazing art tool, an amazing game and crafting tool.
[6253.60s -> 6261.04s]  So it might be a hard sell for most people though,
[6261.04s -> 6263.04s]  because I mean that doesn't surprise me
[6263.04s -> 6265.88s]  because the game asks, it does ask a lot.
[6265.88s -> 6270.98s]  The game's tutorials take as long as like Resident Evil 2 did to beat the whole game.
[6270.98s -> 6272.50s]  At least one of the, you know, sides.
[6273.06s -> 6277.25s]  All right, let me see how that looks.
[6277.25s -> 6277.89s]  Wait, wait, wait.
[6278.53s -> 6280.13s]  I don't want grass all the way over here.
[6280.13s -> 6289.89s]  I'm going to do a little bit and have it fade out.
[6290.45s -> 6299.00s]  All right, let's see what that looks like.
[6299.00s -> 6300.80s]  Because now we go like this.
[6301.68s -> 6309.17s]  Okay, what's going on here?
[6311.57s -> 6312.53s]  What did I fuck up here?
[6315.65s -> 6318.72s]  I did, I screwed something up here and I don't know what.
[6319.60s -> 6326.15s]  I just want to select this and make it look like grass.
[6326.15s -> 6332.50s]  Oh god, this game would be amazing on PC.
[6333.46s -> 6335.70s]  Yeah, it's kind of baffling actually
[6335.70s -> 6338.90s]  that they would spend this much time making such a cool experience
[6338.90s -> 6342.74s]  that you have to control with like the motion controllers or the DualShock.
[6343.78s -> 6348.82s]  If I had a mouse, this stuff would be going 500 times faster.
[6349.38s -> 6352.58s]  And I think that's going to be a huge problem
[6352.58s -> 6354.18s]  for a lot of people that want to get into this game
[6354.18s -> 6358.82s]  is they'll just be like, well, why don't I just go play with Unity instead?
[6358.82s -> 6359.38s]  You know what I mean?
[6360.12s -> 6363.48s]  It's like way too much for like a casual audience to do
[6364.12s -> 6368.31s]  and way too little for somebody that has Unity.
[6368.31s -> 6377.30s]  It's weird because I'm not sure what audience they're targeting with this game.
[6377.86s -> 6384.04s]  But regardless, I need to find out why.
[6385.57s -> 6386.53s]  Why is this happening?
[6391.75s -> 6392.87s]  There we go, volume brush.
[6392.87s -> 6393.27s]  There it was.
[6393.27s -> 6393.83s]  All right, here we go.
[6394.87s -> 6402.12s]  Okay, come down.
[6402.12s -> 6405.48s]  People who want Unity but don't want or don't have a PC or something.
[6405.48s -> 6420.63s]  Maybe I'm going to make this a little tinted a little bit.
[6421.83s -> 6423.56s]  Put on music.
[6423.56s -> 6423.96s]  I will.
[6425.76s -> 6426.08s]  I will.
[6426.08s -> 6426.56s]  Just a minute.
[6427.28s -> 6438.29s]  I'm not sure what the fuck this thing is even for.
[6439.41s -> 6441.19s]  It just kind of screws everything up.
[6441.83s -> 6446.29s]  All right, let's do effects.
[6450.82s -> 6452.34s]  And we need to do wave.
[6453.22s -> 6459.41s]  That's a little too much.
[6459.41s -> 6460.21s]  That's like water.
[6462.88s -> 6463.60s]  Flow maybe.
[6464.24s -> 6470.81s]  Hmm.
[6471.83s -> 6479.06s]  But yeah, to give you like, I guess, I've put the stream for like an hour in like 50 minutes or so.
[6480.10s -> 6480.90s]  And the tutorials.
[6480.90s -> 6483.62s]  I put probably 15 hours in the game so far.
[6483.62s -> 6485.86s]  20 if we count, right?
[6485.86s -> 6488.26s]  Like 15 to 20 if you count the first stream.
[6494.21s -> 6495.57s]  Are you making a poison swamp?
[6495.57s -> 6496.53s]  What is throb?
[6497.09s -> 6497.81s]  Evaporate.
[6499.25s -> 6499.65s]  Boil.
[6501.33s -> 6504.29s]  I really think it just needs to be like wave but just a tiny bit.
[6504.93s -> 6505.73s]  That's all right.
[6505.73s -> 6506.29s]  It looks fine.
[6506.77s -> 6516.74s]  But yeah, I do foresee a very, very difficult time when this releases.
[6517.54s -> 6525.92s]  Because like I said, it's almost too complicated for anyone to play it casually,
[6525.92s -> 6529.12s]  but not complicated enough for somebody that's serious about it.
[6529.12s -> 6534.61s]  Let's change this.
[6535.25s -> 6543.80s]  Is that tight?
[6543.80s -> 6544.28s]  It is.
[6544.84s -> 6552.29s]  Okay, let's see.
[6555.04s -> 6555.54s]  Uh-huh.
[6556.40s -> 6560.39s]  Oh no, not again.
[6560.39s -> 6561.27s]  What happened?
[6561.27s -> 6569.64s]  All right, let me.
[6570.84s -> 6574.64s]  All right, now let's take this back here.
[6578.85s -> 6580.37s]  And I need this look bad.
[6581.09s -> 6582.28s]  All right, let's get it.
[6582.28s -> 6583.80s]  Wait, I can move a tree now over here.
[6584.52s -> 6589.17s]  We've got a good group of green hues.
[6589.81s -> 6594.98s]  What's the end game here?
[6594.98s -> 6595.94s]  I really don't have one.
[6595.94s -> 6597.14s]  I'm just trying to like,
[6597.14s -> 6598.98s]  I'm just trying to make sure I know how to use the tools.
[6602.31s -> 6605.52s]  And then I'm going to make like the ice cream or something.
[6605.52s -> 6610.05s]  I'm going to try to sculpt like a face, but just kind of dicking around.
[6610.61s -> 6614.63s]  Let me add some more color here.
[6615.43s -> 6621.28s]  Same thing.
[6621.28s -> 6622.24s]  We'll do more of this.
[6623.04s -> 6626.05s]  Have I tried the move controllers?
[6626.37s -> 6628.53s]  I have not used the move controllers for one reason,
[6628.53s -> 6629.41s]  because you need the camera.
[6630.05s -> 6632.13s]  And I don't have the PS move,
[6633.25s -> 6634.29s]  PS4 camera anymore,
[6634.29s -> 6636.61s]  because I gave the PS VR to a friend.
[6637.65s -> 6638.69s]  So I don't have it anymore.
[6638.69s -> 6641.89s]  So I have the move controllers, not the camera.
[6644.84s -> 6646.12s]  But I got to pee.
[6646.12s -> 6646.68s]  I'll be right back.
[6649.03s -> 6650.71s]  And then we'll make like a person.
[6650.71s -> 6652.15s]  We'll make like a character.
[6652.15s -> 6766.40s]  I'll be right back.
[6766.40s -> 6769.72s]  All right, I think I have an idea.
[6773.12s -> 6773.76s]  I've got an idea.
[6779.76s -> 6785.32s]  Once I get the scene done, I'm going to make the giant that lives here.
[6791.86s -> 6793.30s]  Play something else now.
[6795.28s -> 6796.64s]  How am I ever going to learn?
[6798.71s -> 6799.51s]  You know what I mean?
[6799.51s -> 6802.31s]  Like how am I ever going to know how to do anything?
[6802.87s -> 6805.14s]  That's been an hour.
[6805.14s -> 6806.10s]  See you later.
[6806.10s -> 6807.38s]  I'm going to play a different game.
[6807.38s -> 6808.82s]  I'll come back and do it again.
[6808.82s -> 6810.90s]  When I, yeah, impossible, by the way.
[6811.78s -> 6818.48s]  Just learn unity instead.
[6827.65s -> 6828.85s]  Imagine learning.
[6828.85s -> 6830.69s]  I know, imagine learning anything.
[6833.54s -> 6835.30s]  No, no learning.
[6835.30s -> 6836.58s]  Only results.
[6837.38s -> 6838.74s]  No preparation.
[6838.74s -> 6839.62s]  No learning.
[6839.62s -> 6841.14s]  Only results.
[6841.14s -> 6851.46s]  Imagine actually learning.
[6851.46s -> 6851.96s]  All right.
[6852.66s -> 6854.82s]  What else do we have for songs?
[6854.82s -> 6867.62s]  I should make water down there too.
[6868.34s -> 6878.50s]  Yeah, I can't tell you this is going to be the most interesting stream,
[6878.50s -> 6879.78s]  but I want to play it.
[6881.49s -> 6882.93s]  I want to learn how to do something.
[6882.93s -> 6883.81s]  So at least I look.
[6884.69s -> 6887.01s]  I was looking forward to this game for a long time, right?
[6887.01s -> 6888.05s]  And we're also going to make it rain.
[6888.77s -> 6889.49s]  They're going to make it.
[6889.49s -> 6890.37s]  Yeah, we're going to make it rain.
[6897.57s -> 6900.53s]  I'm going to take my time and I'm going to just try to make something interesting.
[6900.53s -> 6902.93s]  Look, what you see here, it's the culmination.
[6902.93s -> 6904.93s]  It's going to be in like another hour or two.
[6905.73s -> 6907.49s]  There's going to be like a whole village over here.
[6907.49s -> 6909.01s]  There's going to be like something going on over here.
[6909.01s -> 6911.49s]  I'm just going to make like a big living sculpture.
[6915.59s -> 6917.75s]  The only way you can learn is if you do it.
[6918.47s -> 6919.94s]  That's the only way.
[6919.94s -> 6923.52s]  And it's going to take a little while and that's all right.
[6924.08s -> 6927.99s]  I'm going to move this out of the way.
[6928.55s -> 6934.39s]  You can also study to learn when.
[6935.88s -> 6937.00s]  When would you like me to do that?
[6937.64s -> 6939.06s]  I'm going to take two weeks off.
[6939.70s -> 6943.22s]  I'm going to not stream for two weeks and come back with like two things
[6943.22s -> 6944.10s]  that I made in dreams.
[6944.82s -> 6946.69s]  Is that what you want me to do?
[6947.33s -> 6949.89s]  You sure?
[6959.04s -> 6960.16s]  You were supposed to do that.
[6960.16s -> 6964.24s]  I was supposed to take two weeks off of streaming to learn how to play Dreams?
[6965.64s -> 6967.32s]  What are you talking about?
[6968.20s -> 6978.08s]  What do you mean I did that?
[6980.45s -> 6983.33s]  I said I wanted to do the tutorials, which are 10 hours.
[6991.08s -> 6991.96s]  And I already did it.
[6992.60s -> 6999.59s]  We're talking about when I was with my mother.
[7000.47s -> 7001.11s]  Oh, hey, Ma.
[7001.11s -> 7001.83s]  Nah, nah, nah, sorry.
[7001.83s -> 7003.27s]  We're not what you wait.
[7003.27s -> 7004.55s]  I haven't seen you in like eight months.
[7005.72s -> 7006.36s]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[7006.36s -> 7007.72s]  Just just just just go.
[7007.72s -> 7008.92s]  I'm not going to do anything with you.
[7009.65s -> 7014.07s]  I'm playing Dreams every day for like six to 10 hours a day.
[7015.75s -> 7016.71s]  No, just go home.
[7019.27s -> 7019.99s]  I'm studying.
[7037.19s -> 7039.11s]  No tutorial is going to give you creativity.
[7039.11s -> 7039.43s]  Yeah.
[7039.43s -> 7041.59s]  Like, so what do you think I'm doing right now?
[7042.31s -> 7057.35s]  Let's get a song.
[7072.60s -> 7073.64s]  Did somebody make this?
[7078.63s -> 7080.68s]  Final Fantasy Overworld thing.
[7081.96s -> 7087.60s]  Bubble tea.
[7087.60s -> 7088.88s]  I feel like I want to mix a music.
[7088.88s -> 7090.56s]  I want to make a song too.
[7090.56s -> 7091.68s]  After I'm done with this, I want to make
[7106.07s -> 7108.15s]  I was just like, I want to play list in the background.
[7108.15s -> 7109.67s]  I thought my PlayStation just turned off.
[7110.79s -> 7112.40s]  I was like, what the fuck just happened?
[7113.20s -> 7119.89s]  Let's get the playlist.
[7119.89s -> 7122.29s]  Actually, I can't hear it because the PlayStation 4.
[7124.95s -> 7131.57s]  But on the moon theme, I feel like that'll get old in a few minutes.
[7137.64s -> 7138.44s]  Evil Morty.
[7144.02s -> 7147.48s]  Wait, is this an entire playlist?
[7148.20s -> 7148.84s]  Whoa, okay.
[7153.89s -> 7154.61s]  City folk?
[7162.16s -> 7162.88s]  Not again.
[7164.08s -> 7165.52s]  Oh, near automata.
[7166.24s -> 7167.44s]  Alien manifestation?
[7185.08s -> 7192.10s]  I feel like this is kind of soy milk.
[7194.69s -> 7195.65s]  Added vocals.
[7198.13s -> 7198.37s]  Okay.
[7201.80s -> 7204.63s]  Let's see what you got.
[7209.33s -> 7211.27s]  Added vocals.
[7213.43s -> 7214.23s]  It's just instrument.
[7214.23s -> 7215.91s]  There's no added vocals.
[7215.91s -> 7218.87s]  Let's go here.
[7218.87s -> 7228.60s]  Take the giant.
[7270.31s -> 7271.91s]  This is fucking terrifying.
[7274.36s -> 7274.84s]  Mama.
[7325.94s -> 7327.70s]  Devil in his head.
[7365.91s -> 7367.75s]  This is so scary.
[7367.75s -> 7369.99s]  It really is with this song in the background.
[7370.79s -> 7403.83s]  Oh, that's way too big of an ear.
[7413.84s -> 7417.60s]  It looks like somebody is punching through his head.
[7417.60s -> 7418.56s]  Through his brain.
[7420.05s -> 7420.61s]  That's what it is.
[7463.81s -> 7465.81s]  I don't think I can put blood everywhere, can I?
[7487.43s -> 7489.43s]  It's got to be way, way thinner.
[7495.89s -> 7496.93s]  He's doing a thumbs up.
[7518.00s -> 7519.44s]  That's not a thumb.
[7520.56s -> 7528.50s]  It's not a thumb.
[7528.50s -> 7529.70s]  I gotta get in front of him.
[7529.70s -> 7530.26s]  Look at this.
[7531.06s -> 7534.08s]  Look at that, like cooked, cut up cauliflower.
[7535.91s -> 7536.47s]  I can do it.
[7536.47s -> 7536.87s]  Hold on.
[7557.43s -> 7558.23s]  I can't.
[7563.54s -> 7565.38s]  No, I like it like that.
[7565.38s -> 7566.34s]  That's your thumb.
[7566.34s -> 7568.10s]  Your thumb bends all the way backwards.
[7569.65s -> 7572.29s]  Like a fucking deflated balloon.
[7572.29s -> 7574.29s]  It's not even pointing the right way.
[7576.61s -> 7589.24s]  All right, so that's his end of his hand.
[7589.24s -> 7589.80s]  I'll fix it.
[7591.00s -> 7601.16s]  He's sounding like a clown.
[7602.68s -> 7612.07s]  All right, that's his arm.
[7613.91s -> 7618.48s]  So that's the end of his arm moving up into here.
[7619.60s -> 7621.12s]  Into his like, bicep.
[7624.04s -> 7625.24s]  Oh my god, this is...
[7625.24s -> 7626.28s]  What the fuck have I done?
[7629.57s -> 7631.25s]  I gotta keep track of who is who.
[7632.05s -> 7634.76s]  Because this is bicep into shoulder.
[7640.08s -> 7642.88s]  Okay, so this guy didn't even see him coming.
[7647.46s -> 7648.66s]  By the way, it doesn't...
[7648.66s -> 7650.42s]  This doesn't matter because I just needed to...
[7650.42s -> 7652.82s]  I just needed to look over the edge.
[7658.95s -> 7660.71s]  It just needs to be up...
[7660.71s -> 7664.23s]  When we take the picture, it just needs to be above there.
[7671.88s -> 7675.32s]  All right, so arm and we're gonna have shoulder.
[7675.32s -> 7675.64s]  What does he...
[7675.64s -> 7676.36s]  What does it look like?
[7677.08s -> 7678.36s]  What's like a body look like?
[7678.36s -> 7679.32s]  I don't even fucking know.
[7680.12s -> 7681.24s]  The big cylinder here.
[7682.71s -> 7683.59s]  Tilt it a little bit.
[7684.15s -> 7697.99s]  Okay, so that's like chest.
[7698.95s -> 7701.46s]  I can carve it a little more.
[7701.46s -> 7701.86s]  Hold on.
[7702.58s -> 7711.32s]  Okay, let's go down here.
[7728.52s -> 7730.68s]  They don't need to see the rest of the body.
[7730.68s -> 7732.28s]  And by they, I mean you.
[7732.28s -> 7733.64s]  And by you, I mean me.
[7734.20s -> 7735.96s]  And by people, I mean anyone.
[7736.76s -> 7740.74s]  No, you don't have to see the whole thing.
[7740.74s -> 7745.81s]  Because look, I'm gonna move him over here.
[7746.53s -> 7749.00s]  He's got somebody's head as a wristband.
[7749.56s -> 7755.64s]  All right, let me just...
[7756.44s -> 7757.64s]  Let me move them over here.
[7758.20s -> 7774.39s]  Maybe I need...
[7774.39s -> 7777.33s]  Okay, I might need a little bit of legs.
[7785.33s -> 7802.37s]  That gonna be up a little bit higher this way.
[7803.33s -> 7805.89s]  That's better.
[7811.73s -> 7820.26s]  I love how this shit is moving, but he's not.
[7820.98s -> 7825.28s]  So the head doesn't matter because we don't need a head on him.
[7825.28s -> 7826.85s]  He needs a body.
[7827.41s -> 7831.00s]  I need to take like a good screenshot too.
[7834.90s -> 7836.18s]  All right, we need a body on him.
[7838.79s -> 7839.51s]  The hair too.
[7842.24s -> 7843.28s]  All right, get back in here.
[7843.92s -> 7858.29s]  It's a long ass neck.
[7858.29s -> 7867.38s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[7867.38s -> 7871.20s]  Come down and we'll go like this.
[7872.00s -> 7889.64s]  No, that's not his leg.
[7889.64s -> 7891.72s]  That's his collarbone.
[7891.72s -> 7897.38s]  What is the point of this?
[7898.02s -> 7901.46s]  To just use the program and learn how to use it.
[7901.46s -> 7905.94s]  And be comfortable using it is pretty much the point.
[7911.33s -> 7912.93s]  He's got like a ruffled shirt on.
[7912.93s -> 7919.86s]  And then this has to be a little bigger.
[7920.58s -> 7929.22s]  And arms will come out of here.
[7929.94s -> 7934.79s]  We got a paint job to do too.
[7935.75s -> 7945.16s]  He's made out of party cups.
[7947.56s -> 7959.64s]  He's made out of paper cups.
[7960.60s -> 7961.64s]  Who cares?
[7962.20s -> 7971.41s]  He just wanted to be a real boy.
[7972.21s -> 7973.89s]  All right, all right, all right.
[7973.89s -> 7981.83s]  See from here it doesn't even matter.
[7981.83s -> 7986.29s]  I was making a nice scene too.
[7986.29s -> 7989.73s]  And everyone got like mad because I wasn't doing anything.
[7990.29s -> 7995.12s]  So then I came over and made paper cup monster get punched through his head.
[7995.12s -> 7996.32s]  Are you happy now?
[7996.32s -> 8009.68s]  Are you happy that I made this now?
[8009.68s -> 8011.36s]  Now we're angrier than before.
[8011.36s -> 8012.48s]  All right, let me paint this.
[8018.32s -> 8019.36s]  I need paint.
[8024.12s -> 8025.56s]  Spray can, where is it?
[8025.56s -> 8028.95s]  What about the other guy's head?
[8028.95s -> 8031.19s]  Well, hold on, I need to get this done first.
[8034.77s -> 8036.61s]  These are like paper cups, right?
[8043.91s -> 8045.67s]  It's like fucking solo cups.
[8046.39s -> 8047.83s]  Snap to surface, let's paint.
[8049.03s -> 8056.72s]  Can that face be a new emote?
[8057.36s -> 8059.19s]  No, we can only get one new emote.
[8059.83s -> 8063.76s]  We'll get the circle that's easiest to paint with.
[8064.72s -> 8068.96s]  And spray can and red.
[8071.03s -> 8072.07s]  It's not that dark.
[8072.71s -> 8073.83s]  I guess maybe it is.
[8093.65s -> 8096.74s]  That's a great color.
[8096.74s -> 8098.10s]  Red party cups.
[8104.60s -> 8106.12s]  Proceed to party.
[8128.93s -> 8130.61s]  Careful I don't go all the way up.
[8131.17s -> 8154.36s]  Okay, now this is no longer I don't think party cups anymore.
[8155.16s -> 8157.52s]  I think this is just the guy's like spine.
[8158.56s -> 8162.26s]  I'm gonna make them plastic though.
[8162.26s -> 8164.80s]  So hold your horses.
[8174.63s -> 8176.07s]  Tighten this up just a little bit.
[8176.63s -> 8194.76s]  Okay, I also I have to make this a different group.
[8196.04s -> 8200.42s]  Uh-oh, because if I change the coat on this,
[8201.38s -> 8204.60s]  it's not going to look right for the rest of the person.
[8204.60s -> 8213.04s]  So get me out of here.
[8223.68s -> 8227.20s]  This, okay.
[8227.20s -> 8231.59s]  So this is, uh-oh, I didn't think this through.
[8231.59s -> 8234.87s]  I just kind of was making it because this needs to be a completely separate thing
[8234.87s -> 8237.03s]  from the group so I can change this without changing that.
[8237.67s -> 8248.61s]  Yeah, see, I was supposed to start a new,
[8248.61s -> 8250.21s]  I should have started a new sculpture down here.
[8251.01s -> 8254.55s]  I could just erase the neck.
[8255.94s -> 8258.42s]  But it's still part of the same sculpture though.
[8258.98s -> 8260.85s]  Yeah, I can't break it up.
[8266.64s -> 8267.14s]  Shit.
[8273.96s -> 8277.19s]  Wait, can I cut out?
[8280.58s -> 8285.70s]  Um, I'm not sure what it means by cut out.
[8285.70s -> 8287.78s]  Like cut out the, hold on.
[8288.58s -> 8294.00s]  Will it just take this whole thing?
[8294.64s -> 8300.87s]  Make sure I can see the whole thing.
[8317.72s -> 8318.44s]  Let's see what happens.
[8321.04s -> 8323.44s]  Uh, did I get it?
[8324.00s -> 8329.40s]  Makes it a separate sculpture.
[8330.44s -> 8331.64s]  I don't think I really got it.
[8333.03s -> 8334.47s]  Um, give me the shape.
[8334.47s -> 8335.51s]  Let me just get the square.
[8352.88s -> 8358.82s]  All right, how, are they all in?
[8358.82s -> 8363.60s]  I think they're all in, right?
[8363.60s -> 8371.01s]  Not quite.
[8371.01s -> 8374.37s]  Oh my god, it's so hard to control this and get it in the right spot.
[8374.37s -> 8376.37s]  I wish I could just have the camera stay put.
[8376.37s -> 8378.21s]  Like actually stay in one spot.
[8378.21s -> 8381.43s]  I don't want the camera to follow me around everywhere.
[8381.43s -> 8384.47s]  I wish I could just keep the camera just like up here.
[8384.47s -> 8385.19s]  Just keep it there.
[8385.75s -> 8387.52s]  I don't think you can.
[8387.52s -> 8390.79s]  Because every time I move, it moves the camera forward.
[8390.79s -> 8397.12s]  Did I get it?
[8397.12s -> 8398.56s]  I kind of got it.
[8398.56s -> 8404.60s]  I missed the bottom.
[8405.32s -> 8408.96s]  That's good enough.
[8412.21s -> 8414.29s]  So now, what do I do with that now?
[8414.29s -> 8415.09s]  Just, that's it?
[8415.09s -> 8416.37s]  It's just its own sculpture.
[8420.10s -> 8420.74s]  Okay, cool.
[8421.38s -> 8426.87s]  All right, so let's give it a finish.
[8429.51s -> 8431.11s]  Shiny, where's plastic?
[8431.11s -> 8431.61s]  Plastic.
[8432.23s -> 8437.70s]  It's already there.
[8437.70s -> 8438.74s]  I need something better than that.
[8438.74s -> 8439.24s]  Shiny.
[8440.02s -> 8444.95s]  I'm not really seeing a difference at all.
[8448.23s -> 8449.03s]  Shiny metal.
[8449.67s -> 8457.72s]  Hmm, shiny wax.
[8458.44s -> 8461.32s]  Shiny, plastic, rough, metal.
[8461.96s -> 8469.57s]  Back to here, shiny.
[8469.57s -> 8474.64s]  I don't really see a difference.
[8474.64s -> 8475.52s]  I mean, I guess a little.
[8476.64s -> 8480.64s]  I guess it is shiny, huh?
[8487.96s -> 8489.16s]  A little shiny wax.
[8490.04s -> 8492.16s]  No, that just makes it look weird.
[8505.73s -> 8507.49s]  Well, I mean, it's on there.
[8507.49s -> 8511.01s]  Change the lighting.
[8511.01s -> 8517.92s]  Isn't there a way to turn on like studio lighting or something?
[8517.92s -> 8536.16s]  The guides.
[8537.46s -> 8537.96s]  There it is.
[8539.49s -> 8540.45s]  Studio lighting.
[8546.28s -> 8547.16s]  That's one thing.
[8547.16s -> 8549.48s]  I don't think there was a tutorial for lighting.
[8549.48s -> 8565.35s]  Let me just paint the rest of this.
[8565.35s -> 8580.52s]  So this is going to be, we'll just go with a orange, something blue.
[8581.08s -> 8583.32s]  Big like frost demon, frost giant.
[8583.32s -> 8585.99s]  That's what it's going to be.
[8585.99s -> 8611.84s]  Shit, his head is also a part of this.
[8611.84s -> 8614.80s]  Well, that didn't really turn out exactly what I was looking for.
[8647.17s -> 8647.89s]  Well, okay.
[8649.22s -> 8652.02s]  Close the context menu.
[8652.02s -> 8652.74s]  What happens if I...
[8676.93s -> 8677.97s]  That's like all fucked up.
[8679.91s -> 8681.65s]  I need...
[8681.65s -> 8682.13s]  Here.
[8682.13s -> 8683.25s]  Here's the problem.
[8683.25s -> 8685.48s]  I know what the problem is.
[8685.48s -> 8716.68s]  Oops.
[8744.18s -> 8744.98s]  You don't know what you're looking at?
[8744.98s -> 8745.46s]  Neither do I.
[8751.78s -> 8753.14s]  All I know is I need more grass.
[8784.42s -> 8790.08s]  Okay.
[8790.08s -> 8791.92s]  I need more like snow and shit too.
[8792.72s -> 8800.69s]  Because it's got to be much more pronounced than it is.
[8808.84s -> 8810.12s]  These tops need to be changed.
[8822.93s -> 8823.89s]  That's what I'm talking about.
[8824.61s -> 8826.82s]  Should have been like this since the very beginning.
[8827.62s -> 8832.74s]  Not individual pieces.
[8845.83s -> 8846.33s]  Closer.
[8846.79s -> 8849.68s]  They look like clouds.
[8849.68s -> 8850.18s]  Yeah.
[8851.92s -> 8853.28s]  I think they're just kind of wind.
[8853.28s -> 8854.40s]  I'm going to paint snow on.
[8854.96s -> 8857.04s]  That's a finishing touch though.
[8857.04s -> 8858.16s]  We're not closing it.
[8858.72s -> 8861.88s]  We're going to do the same thing over here.
[8862.68s -> 8867.84s]  I need to like add texture to this shit too.
[8872.58s -> 8873.54s]  Because it looks like...
[8873.54s -> 8874.50s]  It looks like shit.
[8874.50s -> 8875.62s]  Those mountains look like shit.
[8876.98s -> 8877.46s]  You can say it.
[8877.46s -> 8878.42s]  You're not going to hurt my feelings.
[8878.42s -> 8879.54s]  They look like dog shit.
[8880.90s -> 8881.30s]  Say it.
[8882.45s -> 8883.41s]  Don't worry.
[8883.41s -> 8884.05s]  I can handle it.
[8917.16s -> 8951.41s]  Trees moving, right?
[8952.13s -> 8953.41s]  That's a good tree.
[8953.41s -> 8953.91s]  Hold on.
[8955.09s -> 8988.48s]  These are more color.
[8989.04s -> 8994.24s]  I'm not sure I like this.
[8998.79s -> 8999.67s]  You know what I mean?
[8999.67s -> 9000.55s]  I don't think I like it.
[9002.72s -> 9004.20s]  I don't think it adds anything.
[9008.60s -> 9009.00s]  Nah.
[9009.00s -> 9009.56s]  I don't like it.
[9011.01s -> 9011.49s]  All right.
[9011.49s -> 9013.33s]  Now we're going to do a little bit of work down here.
[9013.33s -> 9014.53s]  Because it needs to be some more rocks.
[9014.53s -> 9015.25s]  This is too plain.
[9015.25s -> 9016.53s]  Looks like a textured...
[9017.17s -> 9017.41s]  No.
[9017.41s -> 9018.69s]  This is going to be more detail.
[9019.57s -> 9022.77s]  They call me Jeremy Mr. Detail Elbertson.
[9031.94s -> 9032.58s]  No they don't.
[9032.58s -> 9033.14s]  Yes they do.
[9034.12s -> 9035.08s]  Yes they do.
[9035.08s -> 9039.27s]  Okay.
[9041.52s -> 9043.27s]  Let's get some snow up here.
[9043.91s -> 9046.08s]  I'm going to start with the snow.
[9046.96s -> 9048.98s]  I think a splat would look good.
[9050.31s -> 9051.27s]  Splat with...
[9053.88s -> 9059.89s]  Let's see.
[9059.89s -> 9065.88s]  Make it nice and white here.
[9066.68s -> 9087.25s]  I don't need the kaleidoscope.
[9092.45s -> 9093.25s]  Unnecessary.
[9093.81s -> 9094.37s]  Don't need it.
[9126.16s -> 9126.40s]  Is it...
[9126.40s -> 9126.88s]  What is it on?
[9126.88s -> 9127.28s]  Stamp.
[9127.84s -> 9131.16s]  Brush.
[9131.80s -> 9134.24s]  Brush is fine.
[9134.24s -> 9142.23s]  Paint.
[9142.23s -> 9142.87s]  Same deal.
[9142.87s -> 9143.43s]  No, no, no, no.
[9143.43s -> 9144.47s]  What are you doing?
[9144.47s -> 9145.83s]  What the hell are you doing?
[9145.83s -> 9147.40s]  It's flat.
[9149.99s -> 9150.55s]  Right there.
[9150.55s -> 9150.79s]  Okay.
[9151.51s -> 9155.28s]  Why is it blue?
[9160.93s -> 9161.89s]  Shiny.
[9161.89s -> 9162.45s]  Default.
[9163.25s -> 9164.84s]  Rough.
[9166.95s -> 9168.15s]  I want it to be this color.
[9168.71s -> 9169.59s]  Why is it blue?
[9170.15s -> 9175.54s]  Am I missing something here?
[9176.10s -> 9194.45s]  Can I like...
[9195.25s -> 9197.81s]  No, it's a different sculpture now.
[9197.81s -> 9198.45s]  What the fuck?
[9199.41s -> 9201.97s]  It actually doesn't look bad.
[9211.25s -> 9212.21s]  Sprink it a little bit.
[9226.10s -> 9227.06s]  More clouds.
[9227.06s -> 9227.46s]  Hold on.
[9227.46s -> 9227.86s]  Hold on.
[9227.86s -> 9228.26s]  Hold on.
[9228.26s -> 9228.66s]  Hold on.
[9229.38s -> 9229.86s]  Not yet.
[9230.66s -> 9238.39s]  I need to go this.
[9239.67s -> 9241.27s]  The top should be snow covered, right?
[9242.23s -> 9248.16s]  Um.
[9248.16s -> 9252.66s]  What the fuck happened there?
[9253.30s -> 9273.36s]  No, let's get this on snap.
[9273.36s -> 9278.82s]  It's kind of hard to fucking even see what you're doing.
[9278.82s -> 9295.01s]  He's doing Yoshi's Island?
[9295.01s -> 9295.81s]  Yeah.
[9295.81s -> 9297.01s]  Yeah, you get it.
[9297.01s -> 9318.61s]  Like snow, though.
[9318.61s -> 9319.73s]  I guess it kind of does.
[9319.73s -> 9321.17s]  The clouds sort of ruin it.
[9336.74s -> 9338.58s]  This needs to be a different color.
[9338.58s -> 9342.84s]  It needs to be like blue or light blue.
[9342.84s -> 9346.28s]  It does have to be blue because the more this has to be lighter.
[9346.28s -> 9351.52s]  All right.
[9351.52s -> 9351.92s]  Back in.
[9352.56s -> 9361.32s]  Make the snow glossy.
[9361.32s -> 9362.20s]  Yeah, I could do that too.
[9363.16s -> 9367.88s]  Fuck.
[9368.44s -> 9379.38s]  Oh, I like this.
[9389.75s -> 9391.19s]  Don't you want to just lick this mountain?
[9391.75s -> 9392.55s]  I do.
[9392.55s -> 9404.40s]  I think I could make it a little bit bigger.
[9404.40s -> 9409.88s]  Maybe not.
[9409.88s -> 9411.56s]  It's getting caught on itself.
[9411.56s -> 9416.74s]  And then I also have to do some more detail to the mountains themselves.
[9416.74s -> 9431.70s]  Oh, it's the shadow.
[9431.70s -> 9432.34s]  I get it.
[9432.34s -> 9432.66s]  Okay.
[9433.54s -> 9443.73s]  I was going to say, why is it changing color?
[9444.29s -> 9451.67s]  Oh, God.
[9451.67s -> 9452.39s]  I'm going to throw up.
[9454.16s -> 9462.52s]  Oh, honey.
[9462.52s -> 9463.64s]  Now I'm going to do the tip last.
[9466.18s -> 9469.78s]  Do you think I can copy this and put it over on the other sculptures?
[9469.78s -> 9476.31s]  I mean, that's cheating.
[9478.76s -> 9479.80s]  But it's okay.
[9479.80s -> 9488.52s]  You don't think I could cheat this?
[9488.52s -> 9497.76s]  All right.
[9497.76s -> 9500.87s]  Let's get up here and get the peak.
[9500.87s -> 9502.15s]  And I got to make it snow.
[9520.04s -> 9520.68s]  Yes.
[9527.17s -> 9529.41s]  It's a little grassy looking, but it's all right.
[9529.41s -> 9539.28s]  I'm going to fluff it up a little bit.
[9539.28s -> 9550.04s]  Oops.
[9550.84s -> 9554.95s]  We need the styles.
[9555.91s -> 9556.47s]  Looseness.
[9556.47s -> 9556.71s]  All right.
[9556.71s -> 9557.59s]  Here we go.
[9557.59s -> 9577.08s]  Might be a little too loose.
[9577.08s -> 9593.57s]  That's all right.
[9594.29s -> 9596.24s]  That doesn't look terrible.
[9606.98s -> 9607.62s]  Ruffle them up.
[9608.66s -> 9610.64s]  Now I'll pull it back.
[9610.64s -> 9614.44s]  I think that looks fine.
[9615.00s -> 9618.08s]  This is a little heavy over here, though.
[9618.08s -> 9625.83s]  I think I need to move this a little or shave a little bit off
[9625.83s -> 9628.39s]  because it's a little heavy handed over here.
[9629.27s -> 9630.39s]  Just a little.
[9630.39s -> 9643.60s]  This little part kicking up right here.
[9649.86s -> 9650.98s]  Right there.
[9654.31s -> 9671.17s]  I can't get this one.
[9674.18s -> 9674.58s]  There it is.
[9676.74s -> 9677.46s]  All right.
[9677.46s -> 9678.18s]  I think that's good.
[9684.07s -> 9685.43s]  Now should I drop it?
[9685.43s -> 9686.79s]  Should I make these bigger and drop them?
[9700.39s -> 9709.99s]  I don't think I even need these ones.
[9709.99s -> 9721.01s]  I need to add a little bit over here.
[9721.01s -> 9731.32s]  A little too intense, I think.
[9755.20s -> 9756.08s]  Drop it even lower.
[9763.33s -> 9764.77s]  I think I'm getting rid of this one.
[9764.77s -> 9766.96s]  Let me see what it looks like.
[9766.96s -> 9768.24s]  Yeah.
[9768.24s -> 9768.56s]  Yeah.
[9768.56s -> 9769.28s]  I mean, like, yeah.
[9770.32s -> 9770.80s]  See you later.
[9770.80s -> 9771.60s]  That's gone.
[9771.60s -> 9772.32s]  Wait a minute.
[9772.32s -> 9775.06s]  I think I'm just going to shave it.
[9775.06s -> 9776.26s]  I need more, like, over here.
[9777.06s -> 9780.52s]  I need to add lore.
[9781.88s -> 9782.76s]  Not yet.
[9782.76s -> 9783.80s]  I can't do that yet.
[9786.58s -> 9789.46s]  My housemates are going to think I'm fucking insane
[9789.46s -> 9792.26s]  if they hear three seconds of that song again.
[9792.90s -> 9805.92s]  And you just keep replaying a midi version of Bohemian Rhapsody.
[9807.56s -> 9809.16s]  No, they're not going to think you're insane.
[9809.16s -> 9812.28s]  They're going to think you're learning how to play that song on the piano.
[9813.00s -> 9815.48s]  And you keep starting over, over and over again
[9815.48s -> 9818.39s]  to learn the first 10 to 20 notes.
[9819.11s -> 9823.48s]  Jeremy's going through a rough patch?
[9823.48s -> 9824.36s]  What are you talking about?
[9824.92s -> 9828.02s]  Hey, get off my case, okay?
[9828.02s -> 9829.94s]  I'm trying to learn how to play Dreams.
[9829.94s -> 9843.25s]  I might just turn this into, like, a fucking super expressionist
[9843.25s -> 9844.69s]  broad painting here.
[9844.69s -> 9848.26s]  That means I can move this out.
[9848.26s -> 9853.86s]  Make these a little bit.
[9853.86s -> 9855.64s]  No, no, no.
[9855.64s -> 9859.24s]  No, no, no, no.
[9859.24s -> 9859.72s]  Look at this.
[9859.72s -> 9861.08s]  Look how fucking huge this is.
[9861.08s -> 9861.32s]  All right.
[9861.32s -> 9862.52s]  The trees are too big.
[9862.52s -> 9863.40s]  I figured out the problem.
[9864.04s -> 9868.58s]  The trees are too big.
[9868.58s -> 9869.54s]  Now it looks different.
[9869.54s -> 9870.02s]  Looks better.
[9878.64s -> 9879.92s]  Now we got skill.
[9879.92s -> 9881.12s]  That didn't look good.
[9881.12s -> 9884.93s]  What happened here?
[9884.93s -> 9887.48s]  It's all right.
[9887.48s -> 9889.40s]  We're not taking the picture from that side anyways.
[9889.40s -> 9901.84s]  I'm taking the picture from...
[9902.88s -> 9905.60s]  I don't know.
[9905.60s -> 9908.90s]  This is a three-hour long bit.
[9909.94s -> 9911.78s]  No, there is no joke here.
[9912.26s -> 9915.73s]  Look, not everything has to be a joke, okay?
[9915.73s -> 9920.55s]  You know, and in fact, no.
[9920.55s -> 9922.55s]  We're just doing a mountain scene.
[9922.55s -> 9942.23s]  How does it...
[9942.23s -> 9942.63s]  Okay.
[9943.27s -> 9943.75s]  I know.
[9943.75s -> 9945.59s]  Your roommates are gonna fucking kill you.
[9945.59s -> 9945.99s]  I know.
[9945.99s -> 9946.47s]  Okay.
[9946.47s -> 9952.42s]  I took care of it.
[9952.42s -> 9953.30s]  These need to be changed.
[9953.30s -> 9958.44s]  They've got to look a little different.
[9958.44s -> 9959.96s]  By the way, I'm going for it.
[9959.96s -> 9968.58s]  No, don't ever tell me that.
[9968.58s -> 9970.66s]  You can't, like, change that and make that look all right.
[9971.30s -> 9972.79s]  We're taking a photo.
[9978.68s -> 9980.44s]  Look, you'll see what it's going to turn into.
[9990.68s -> 9991.96s]  It's balding.
[9991.96s -> 9994.98s]  It's not balding.
[9994.98s -> 10001.83s]  Okay, I want to rotate this.
[10019.86s -> 10020.82s]  Not bad.
[10020.82s -> 10021.46s]  It's all right.
[10021.46s -> 10021.94s]  Not bad.
[10027.03s -> 10028.15s]  These need to be changed.
[10028.15s -> 10029.67s]  They need to look a little better.
[10029.67s -> 10031.03s]  I'm gonna add some more patterns on them.
[10031.03s -> 10031.67s]  Some more rocks.
[10056.48s -> 10058.48s]  Try and play Dreams, goddammit.
[10058.48s -> 10087.11s]  Get up here.
[10087.11s -> 10088.87s]  No, mom, I'm studying.
[10088.87s -> 10093.89s]  I thought you were gonna show me the Vegas Strip.
[10093.89s -> 10094.21s]  No.
[10104.37s -> 10107.35s]  There needs to be more snow across it.
[10107.35s -> 10111.19s]  I'll fix it.
[10111.19s -> 10112.95s]  This is gonna be nice and tidy in a minute.
[10112.95s -> 10113.27s]  This is...
[10113.27s -> 10114.95s]  I'm just trying to get the gist of it here.
[10115.59s -> 10130.07s]  Rome wasn't built in the day.
[10130.63s -> 10136.87s]  It was built in, like, fucking over the course of 75 years.
[10137.59s -> 10143.51s]  Results, results, results.
[10143.51s -> 10144.63s]  I'll give you results.
[10144.63s -> 10145.67s]  I'm just gonna wait a little bit.
[10146.23s -> 10156.04s]  Just wait till I make my first video game on this spring.
[10156.68s -> 10173.52s]  Now, that's really fucking terrible looking.
[10174.32s -> 10179.84s]  I just don't need it.
[10192.80s -> 10196.48s]  Not bad.
[10196.48s -> 10197.28s]  Maybe even more.
[10197.28s -> 10197.92s]  Ends lower.
[10216.79s -> 10220.64s]  A little too much snow.
[10225.27s -> 10253.70s]  Facial hair mountain.
[10253.70s -> 10254.34s]  Turn.
[10254.34s -> 10254.66s]  Tilt.
[10256.50s -> 10256.90s]  Grab.
[10257.72s -> 10258.52s]  Tilt.
[10258.52s -> 10269.30s]  This just has more snow on it.
[10269.30s -> 10270.18s]  It's fine.
[10270.18s -> 10276.02s]  All right.
[10276.02s -> 10285.96s]  We're getting there.
[10285.96s -> 10286.92s]  Now, I need to make a...
[10287.64s -> 10290.21s]  This has to come out a little bit further.
[10290.21s -> 10296.37s]  There's not enough trees.
[10296.37s -> 10296.85s]  There's gotta be...
[10297.97s -> 10306.13s]  Maybe like a body of water.
[10306.13s -> 10307.09s]  Body of water.
[10308.95s -> 10309.35s]  Yeah.
[10309.35s -> 10309.59s]  Yup.
[10310.15s -> 10314.31s]  Check this out.
[10314.31s -> 10314.55s]  All right.
[10314.55s -> 10315.75s]  This is gonna be done right.
[10315.75s -> 10319.04s]  I'm gonna make, like, a big body of water right here.
[10319.04s -> 10320.00s]  A big ice lake.
[10321.20s -> 10329.12s]  How am I gonna do that, though?
[10332.12s -> 10332.68s]  Paint tool?
[10333.24s -> 10342.93s]  And then do, like, circle?
[10344.26s -> 10345.54s]  Now, what does that look like?
[10346.10s -> 10350.55s]  Let me just see what this looks like.
[10351.11s -> 10355.89s]  Now, it's gotta be denser than that.
[10357.25s -> 10358.61s]  Although it might not need to be.
[10359.49s -> 10367.00s]  That could be decent water.
[10384.79s -> 10386.95s]  If it's painted on thick enough, it will be all right, I think.
[10393.08s -> 10394.44s]  Maybe a little bit of a...
[10394.44s -> 10394.92s]  Let's see.
[10402.08s -> 10402.88s]  No, that's fine.
[10403.52s -> 10406.63s]  And then I can do flow on it.
[10406.63s -> 10407.27s]  But what are the other...
[10407.27s -> 10408.23s]  Let me see the other shapes.
[10410.40s -> 10410.96s]  Square.
[10411.76s -> 10423.49s]  Let's see.
[10423.49s -> 10424.21s]  Compare the two.
[10425.17s -> 10427.43s]  This one's a little more pixely.
[10428.15s -> 10431.78s]  Although I could do a different stroke here.
[10431.78s -> 10433.70s]  Let's try heavy.
[10434.26s -> 10439.89s]  That's heavy.
[10441.92s -> 10444.40s]  Although this looks like ice crystals.
[10444.40s -> 10453.49s]  You know what I'm saying?
[10456.02s -> 10459.54s]  This is more water-like, but this is ice crystals and chunks of ice.
[10460.10s -> 10462.00s]  Let me try something here.
[10462.00s -> 10462.40s]  Hold on.
[10463.04s -> 10466.31s]  Check this out.
[10466.95s -> 10469.48s]  Now, let's go with the square.
[10470.28s -> 10493.25s]  I'm gonna change this.
[10494.05s -> 10497.04s]  Can I do a custom one of these?
[10497.04s -> 10503.88s]  Okay.
[10503.88s -> 10505.17s]  I think I can.
[10505.17s -> 10506.05s]  Pure mixed.
[10507.14s -> 10508.26s]  Save color.
[10508.26s -> 10508.98s]  Clear mixer.
[10509.54s -> 10513.80s]  Let's go with this.
[10515.41s -> 10516.21s]  Add.
[10516.21s -> 10518.31s]  And then mix.
[10518.31s -> 10518.79s]  Tumble.
[10525.57s -> 10526.29s]  Save color.
[10528.66s -> 10529.30s]  And then can I...
[10530.10s -> 10532.98s]  Can I mix them up to make it so it's a gradient like the other ones?
[10533.70s -> 10538.04s]  Whoa.
[10538.68s -> 10539.56s]  That's not what I wanted.
[10540.20s -> 10545.56s]  This has to be a way to get that...
[10546.20s -> 10549.16s]  To do my own gradient.
[10562.42s -> 10563.38s]  L1 and direction.
[10563.38s -> 10564.82s]  Now, let's just change in the frame.
[10565.86s -> 10566.34s]  Mixed.
[10567.22s -> 10567.70s]  Well, wait.
[10568.66s -> 10570.00s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[10570.00s -> 10570.48s]  Get over here.
[10576.39s -> 10576.79s]  Pure.
[10577.67s -> 10578.07s]  Mixed.
[10578.79s -> 10583.17s]  I'll get it.
[10589.76s -> 10590.96s]  I want to make my own gradient.
[10594.18s -> 10594.58s]  Oh, well.
[10594.58s -> 10594.90s]  Fuck it.
[10595.70s -> 10599.24s]  I'm just gonna go with like a light blue.
[10599.24s -> 10603.64s]  All right.
[10603.64s -> 10604.84s]  You can get out of here now.
[10604.84s -> 10617.33s]  I actually kind of like the crystal-y ice looking one.
[10617.89s -> 10619.99s]  And I'll add the flow to it and comb it.
[10620.63s -> 10627.22s]  This is the most water-like, but I like this one.
[10627.22s -> 10629.56s]  All right.
[10629.56s -> 10629.96s]  Here we go.
[10632.68s -> 10635.56s]  So I need this to be a...
[10635.56s -> 10637.48s]  I need like a zone here.
[10637.48s -> 10638.90s]  What do I want this?
[10638.90s -> 10642.66s]  I want this to start here and come out this way.
[10643.54s -> 10644.90s]  Like that and go over here.
[10648.98s -> 10649.54s]  Let's try it.
[10656.71s -> 10657.59s]  It was this one.
[10659.60s -> 10661.36s]  And it was this color.
[10661.36s -> 10662.40s]  It was this light one.
[10664.07s -> 10668.55s]  And it was wax, shiny metal, shiny.
[10668.55s -> 10669.27s]  It is water.
[10672.00s -> 10672.32s]  Okay.
[10678.36s -> 10679.48s]  Nah, this won't be that much work.
[10679.48s -> 10680.04s]  Check this out.
[10680.04s -> 10680.44s]  Watch this.
[10681.00s -> 10683.32s]  I'm just gonna do it flat.
[10683.32s -> 10684.60s]  I'm gonna zoom out.
[10684.60s -> 10686.36s]  I'm gonna get a ballpark here.
[10686.36s -> 10688.36s]  We'll do flat like this and check it out.
[10688.36s -> 10689.00s]  One, two, three.
[10689.96s -> 10697.92s]  Why is it on Kaleidoscope?
[10700.08s -> 10702.00s]  I never picked Kaleidoscope, did I?
[10702.64s -> 10703.92s]  Wait, what the fuck is going on here?
[10704.48s -> 10707.57s]  What are you talking about?
[10709.65s -> 10711.01s]  Well, okay.
[10717.44s -> 10719.76s]  Looks like I'm just gonna have to paint a big one in front of my face.
[10720.40s -> 10734.21s]  And we're just gonna have to scale it.
[10734.85s -> 10747.43s]  Hydrate?
[10749.01s -> 10749.89s]  I will.
[10749.89s -> 10752.10s]  When I go on a break, I will.
[10752.10s -> 10753.62s]  Don't worry, I will hydrate properly.
[10754.34s -> 10763.70s]  Yeah, this looks nice and icy.
[10764.26s -> 10770.92s]  Once it starts to move around a little bit and I shape it.
[10771.56s -> 10774.28s]  How big does it need to be?
[10780.90s -> 10781.62s]  Actually pretty big.
[10781.62s -> 10783.30s]  So let's make it actually much bigger.
[10800.58s -> 10801.38s]  All right, here we go.
[10801.38s -> 10802.34s]  Let's try it.
[10802.34s -> 10803.70s]  Let's just get it in there and see if I can...
[10803.70s -> 10804.74s]  I can always fix it later.
[10808.20s -> 10810.58s]  Well, okay.
[10811.54s -> 10812.66s]  Did not know that was happening.
[10813.62s -> 10814.58s]  So we're gonna take the...
[10815.70s -> 10820.90s]  Give me a break.
[10830.93s -> 10843.56s]  Okay, for this one, let's just get it over there.
[10844.36s -> 10851.19s]  I need to just get it out here.
[10858.72s -> 10860.32s]  I can add to it in a minute.
[10860.32s -> 10861.36s]  Let's put it right here.
[10864.84s -> 10866.68s]  So I need a lot more paint on this.
[10872.05s -> 10874.05s]  A lot more and then it has to wrap around here.
[10877.78s -> 10878.18s]  Let's go.
[10878.82s -> 10888.72s]  Bring it over here.
[10888.72s -> 10889.28s]  What are you doing?
[10893.81s -> 10895.89s]  Let's do brush is fine.
[10896.85s -> 10898.37s]  I'm gonna snap to surface.
[10899.25s -> 10906.29s]  So it should be snapping to here.
[10907.09s -> 10907.97s]  All right, here we go.
[10908.53s -> 10920.12s]  Why is this a different color?
[10920.68s -> 10928.21s]  It's not.
[10928.21s -> 10929.49s]  It's just a weird shadow.
[10930.13s -> 10939.36s]  And there was a spot here that I need to fill in.
[10939.36s -> 10954.95s]  There we go.
[10954.95s -> 10958.39s]  Imagine playing MS Paint with a PS4 controller.
[10961.78s -> 10964.77s]  I mean, I think you're wrong,
[10964.77s -> 10967.17s]  but you're also not wrong at the same time.
[10967.17s -> 10969.65s]  You know what I mean?
[10970.13s -> 10985.00s]  Okay, it does look pretty icy.
[10988.00s -> 10989.20s]  Needs to come across here.
[10990.00s -> 11005.28s]  I mean, we don't care about
[11005.28s -> 11011.06s]  what it looks like underneath at the moment.
[11011.06s -> 11021.75s]  It just needs to exist.
[11021.75s -> 11024.15s]  Because all that matters is like here,
[11024.15s -> 11027.72s]  a little bit over here too.
[11027.72s -> 11042.50s]  It's messy, but it'll get the job done.
[11042.50s -> 11043.08s]  It will.
[11051.33s -> 11053.78s]  No, it don't matter.
[11053.78s -> 11054.26s]  It don't matter.
[11054.26s -> 11055.78s]  It just needs to get the job done.
[11055.78s -> 11064.47s]  Because guess what?
[11064.47s -> 11082.05s]  Now I put like a boulder over here.
[11082.05s -> 11082.77s]  Check this, right?
[11088.13s -> 11089.73s]  Now give me the, like this.
[11090.53s -> 11094.52s]  I'm just gonna see.
[11094.52s -> 11095.88s]  I'm just gonna test something.
[11095.88s -> 11124.39s]  Okay, and then it's gonna come up here.
[11125.35s -> 11130.32s]  Actually, one big one right here.
[11131.12s -> 11145.48s]  See, this is the, okay.
[11145.48s -> 11146.60s]  I just got a quest.
[11146.60s -> 11147.96s]  Okay, this is the worst part, right?
[11148.60s -> 11150.20s]  I want to like move it down,
[11151.25s -> 11154.04s]  but I can't move it down.
[11154.04s -> 11155.24s]  Because it moves my imp.
[11155.80s -> 11159.40s]  I just want to move this thing I'm holding straight down.
[11162.90s -> 11163.94s]  It's almost like I have to go
[11163.94s -> 11165.22s]  with like a strange angle
[11165.22s -> 11167.62s]  to like move this back and forth where I want to.
[11168.34s -> 11183.25s]  Like, I don't want to move the camera forward.
[11183.25s -> 11185.41s]  I want to move this forward.
[11185.41s -> 11187.32s]  You know what I'm saying?
[11191.33s -> 11199.33s]  Like, this is a tutorial.
[11199.33s -> 11201.49s]  I mean, I did the tutorials already.
[11201.49s -> 11208.31s]  Because I can go like this.
[11208.31s -> 11212.47s]  I can move in and out and all around.
[11212.47s -> 11214.64s]  I can circle.
[11214.64s -> 11217.88s]  I can go up and down, left and right.
[11217.88s -> 11220.68s]  But I want to just move this thing
[11220.68s -> 11222.68s]  that I'm holding forward and backward.
[11222.68s -> 11224.64s]  You know what I'm saying?
[11225.91s -> 11227.43s]  Is it the snap surface thing?
[11228.23s -> 11232.88s]  Is that, okay.
[11233.52s -> 11235.70s]  Oh, Jesus Christ.
[11235.70s -> 11236.66s]  That's not what I wanted to do.
[11237.38s -> 11246.31s]  Yeah, but even still though.
[11246.31s -> 11247.67s]  Okay, so snap surface is off.
[11248.39s -> 11249.67s]  And this is where it gets weird.
[11249.67s -> 11251.99s]  All right, so when I'm holding a device
[11252.71s -> 11255.83s]  and I hold back, the camera doesn't move.
[11258.07s -> 11259.91s]  It's like weird how the camera...
[11259.91s -> 11262.31s]  This controls the camera and it also controls...
[11262.31s -> 11262.95s]  You see what I'm saying?
[11264.96s -> 11266.88s]  I don't want to move forward.
[11266.88s -> 11269.72s]  I just want to move this.
[11269.72s -> 11271.48s]  Let me move this thing forward.
[11271.48s -> 11272.84s]  No, let's move the camera too.
[11274.64s -> 11275.36s]  That's awful.
[11275.92s -> 11280.45s]  Does it have to do that?
[11282.18s -> 11283.38s]  This is to lock the camera.
[11284.02s -> 11285.46s]  But when you lock the camera,
[11285.46s -> 11286.82s]  you just move in and out and all around.
[11290.20s -> 11291.64s]  There has to be a way where you can
[11292.28s -> 11294.60s]  not move the camera and just move the device.
[11298.13s -> 11299.81s]  You would think it would be maybe like an R?
[11299.81s -> 11300.77s]  Like one of the Rs?
[11300.77s -> 11301.73s]  No, let's rewind.
[11302.45s -> 11305.25s]  Well, whatever.
[11305.25s -> 11306.69s]  That's a minor complaint, but it is...
[11307.49s -> 11309.14s]  I just don't like when the camera moves.
[11309.14s -> 11310.50s]  I wish I could just stop the camera from moving.
[11311.14s -> 11319.64s]  You know, let's see how...
[11319.64s -> 11320.28s]  No, no, no, no.
[11321.62s -> 11342.00s]  No, I want the rounded one.
[11342.00s -> 11342.64s]  No, I don't.
[11342.64s -> 11343.28s]  What do I want?
[11344.08s -> 11345.06s]  What do I want?
[11346.18s -> 11348.88s]  There we go.
[11370.24s -> 11371.20s]  No, too fleshy.
[11371.84s -> 11372.90s]  That's not terrible.
[11389.67s -> 11390.17s]  No!
[11407.08s -> 11410.20s]  It's his hand coming up from the other side.
[11415.65s -> 11417.73s]  It's somebody else reaching up here.
[11425.64s -> 11426.68s]  There's somebody down here.
[11429.59s -> 11430.07s]  No, no.
[11430.07s -> 11430.31s]  All right.
[11430.31s -> 11432.15s]  Let's get this rock and frosty colored.
[11432.15s -> 11433.27s]  And then I got to change this
[11433.91s -> 11435.11s]  because this needs to be like a little...
[11435.11s -> 11435.67s]  This has to be...
[11435.67s -> 11436.55s]  Well, it could be just ice.
[11437.35s -> 11438.87s]  It doesn't have to be that.
[11439.67s -> 11445.52s]  It's a giant drowned in the lake.
[11446.08s -> 11449.72s]  You know, I'm sure this looks really good in his head.
[11450.68s -> 11459.16s]  It didn't look like anything in my head.
[11459.16s -> 11459.48s]  You know what?
[11459.48s -> 11459.96s]  Yeah, fuck it.
[11459.96s -> 11461.24s]  That's a metal hand.
[11461.24s -> 11486.96s]  Change the tint.
[11487.44s -> 11498.92s]  This is going to be called the War of the Giants.
[11505.68s -> 11506.88s]  What color do I want this to be?
[11507.52s -> 11515.09s]  Don't you think it should be called that?
[11515.09s -> 11519.43s]  Okay, that looks better.
[11519.99s -> 11521.52s]  And now let's shape...
[11521.52s -> 11522.08s]  Okay, hold on.
[11522.08s -> 11523.12s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11530.44s -> 11534.13s]  That's a hand grabbing.
[11534.13s -> 11535.09s]  It's like right hand.
[11535.65s -> 11536.77s]  Face needs to be here.
[11537.33s -> 11550.07s]  Now I want some junior mints.
[11551.51s -> 11558.00s]  Hold on.
[11558.00s -> 11558.72s]  Just wait.
[11558.72s -> 11559.20s]  Wait.
[11559.20s -> 11560.16s]  I'm studying.
[11560.16s -> 11564.32s]  Let me open up the menu.
[11564.32s -> 11565.36s]  I got to do the ice first.
[11565.36s -> 11566.08s]  Hold on.
[11566.08s -> 11567.28s]  Everybody's freaking out.
[11568.00s -> 11572.31s]  I need...
[11572.87s -> 11573.97s]  We need some glow.
[11574.53s -> 11577.49s]  Needs to be bright blue.
[11578.21s -> 11586.90s]  Okay.
[11587.46s -> 11592.64s]  The finish is already a shiny metal.
[11592.64s -> 11593.84s]  Let's go ahead and apply it though.
[11597.91s -> 11601.16s]  Not that shiny.
[11601.16s -> 11607.94s]  Okay.
[11607.94s -> 11609.14s]  Let's go to effects.
[11610.10s -> 11611.59s]  Flow.
[11612.15s -> 11632.00s]  Too much flow.
[11632.00s -> 11633.52s]  It is ice, you're right.
[11633.52s -> 11638.68s]  We need a little bit though.
[11638.68s -> 11639.56s]  Just a little.
[11639.56s -> 11642.93s]  No, you're right.
[11642.93s -> 11643.41s]  No flow.
[11643.97s -> 11649.67s]  Boil.
[11649.67s -> 11650.79s]  It's boiling.
[11652.63s -> 11653.19s]  Ha, ha, ha.
[11665.99s -> 11668.31s]  Yeah, because it's going to be fire flowing down into it.
[11668.31s -> 11669.11s]  No, stop it.
[11669.11s -> 11669.51s]  Stop it.
[11669.51s -> 11670.95s]  Just like I need to finish this thing.
[11671.51s -> 11687.24s]  Wasn't I going to make like a game?
[11687.24s -> 11687.72s]  I need...
[11688.36s -> 11690.60s]  How are these looking?
[11690.60s -> 11691.64s]  These are moving a little bit.
[11691.64s -> 11692.76s]  We need some more sounds.
[11694.74s -> 11696.34s]  What is playing right now?
[11696.90s -> 11698.48s]  Hold on.
[11698.48s -> 11700.16s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11703.68s -> 11704.64s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11705.20s -> 11721.03s]  That's too much wind.
[11721.03s -> 11731.73s]  It's kind of just spinning around.
[11731.73s -> 11732.29s]  Where is...
[11736.07s -> 11736.87s]  Holy shit.
[11746.68s -> 11747.08s]  Whoa.
[11748.24s -> 11749.04s]  Ha, ha, ha.
[11759.17s -> 11760.53s]  I don't hate this.
[11760.53s -> 11762.37s]  I'm going to make it a little bit smaller.
[11762.37s -> 11772.55s]  Wait, hold on.
[11772.55s -> 11798.77s]  Damn.
[11798.77s -> 11800.05s]  It's like the ice.
[11802.08s -> 11802.80s]  Okay, hold on.
[11802.80s -> 11803.36s]  I need to get...
[11804.00s -> 11804.64s]  I got an idea.
[11805.20s -> 11806.24s]  Idea, idea, idea.
[11806.24s -> 11806.72s]  Back it up.
[11808.74s -> 11810.74s]  I'm going to make more of this on the ice.
[11810.74s -> 11817.78s]  Okay, close this.
[11817.78s -> 11827.16s]  Let's make this a little cleaner.
[11827.16s -> 11843.96s]  All right, so now I want to put...
[11844.76s -> 11845.80s]  Check this shit out.
[11845.80s -> 11851.36s]  You're going to see a real five trillion IQ hyper brain.
[11855.76s -> 11859.52s]  We're going to do some lines here.
[11859.52s -> 11860.16s]  Just a few.
[11860.16s -> 11868.26s]  Just like one of them to paint mode.
[11868.26s -> 11870.69s]  We're going to do a...
[11872.56s -> 11873.76s]  Don't want the surface snap.
[11876.18s -> 11882.47s]  I want a straight line and I want it to be a mist.
[11884.21s -> 11885.57s]  So I don't know.
[11889.04s -> 11890.16s]  This doesn't look bad.
[11890.16s -> 11891.12s]  The scribble is okay.
[11891.12s -> 11892.08s]  I think the scribble will do it.
[11892.72s -> 11894.08s]  Let me see what the scribble looks like.
[11895.67s -> 11896.15s]  Absolutely.
[11896.95s -> 11900.07s]  Okay, so here let's show what...
[11900.07s -> 11901.35s]  I'm going to show you what I'm talking about here.
[11901.83s -> 11904.56s]  We're going to get the scribble.
[11905.44s -> 11910.13s]  I'm going to make sure it is white or blue.
[11911.35s -> 11914.50s]  Yeah, yeah, it's going to be blue.
[11914.50s -> 11915.94s]  Oh, just wait till you see what happens.
[11915.94s -> 11916.74s]  You're going to fucking...
[11916.74s -> 11920.18s]  Everyone's going to resubscribe after you unsubscribe.
[11920.74s -> 11925.65s]  Everyone's going to just resubscribe right now.
[11925.65s -> 11932.28s]  Okay, here we go.
[11932.28s -> 11945.03s]  All right, okay, easy.
[11947.60s -> 11948.16s]  Take this.
[11948.96s -> 11958.53s]  All right.
[11958.53s -> 11971.81s]  Hold on, hold on.
[11972.45s -> 11995.68s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11995.76s -> 12001.99s]  Light sphere, now I need...
[12002.63s -> 12016.48s]  Wait, we've got five community subs.
[12016.48s -> 12019.97s]  Holy shit, five community subs.
[12019.97s -> 12020.77s]  Fucking shitting me.
[12025.28s -> 12027.52s]  Thank you to Torati for the five subs.
[12027.52s -> 12031.76s]  Where's the way I can make it so they...
[12032.48s -> 12034.56s]  It's a pulse or something.
[12036.07s -> 12037.51s]  Fade in, fade out.
[12037.51s -> 12038.23s]  No, no, no.
[12038.79s -> 12040.84s]  It's called something.
[12040.84s -> 12044.15s]  What the fuck is it called?
[12044.15s -> 12045.19s]  It's called like Pulse.
[12046.36s -> 12046.92s]  Where is it?
[12053.06s -> 12053.62s]  Pulse.
[12053.62s -> 12054.18s]  Where is it?
[12054.18s -> 12055.14s]  I know it exists.
[12057.33s -> 12057.73s]  Pulse.
[12061.97s -> 12064.48s]  Ooh, okay.
[12065.12s -> 12077.48s]  Okay, hold on.
[12077.96s -> 12098.29s]  Plane, inside sphere.
[12098.29s -> 12099.89s]  I think inside sphere is probably the best.
[12102.08s -> 12103.52s]  This guy hates his fan.
[12104.96s -> 12106.00s]  Salmon or breakfast?
[12107.20s -> 12108.72s]  Salmon is I think is...
[12108.72s -> 12109.92s]  I definitely didn't say anything,
[12109.92s -> 12111.20s]  but I'm going to say salmon.
[12111.92s -> 12116.64s]  There, there's like a little bit of mist.
[12118.02s -> 12126.60s]  Scale, jitter, probably like that.
[12127.16s -> 12133.70s]  And then we can do...
[12133.70s -> 12134.82s]  We can take off the fades.
[12135.62s -> 12140.47s]  Maybe do the playback.
[12140.47s -> 12141.75s]  Maybe do it faster.
[12142.39s -> 12143.59s]  Where's like playback speed?
[12144.31s -> 12151.73s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[12152.05s -> 12156.80s]  Ha ha ha.
[12156.80s -> 12159.36s]  Now what would that even be?
[12159.36s -> 12160.96s]  Now all I have to do is go like this.
[12171.19s -> 12171.91s]  Check this out.
[12172.47s -> 12175.56s]  I'm going to do like five or two or three percent.
[12175.56s -> 12177.48s]  This is going to be underneath the ice.
[12177.48s -> 12178.52s]  This is what I'm going for here.
[12179.32s -> 12183.19s]  So it's going to be like crackling ice.
[12184.63s -> 12191.72s]  Yeah, now you get it.
[12197.89s -> 12198.53s]  There we go.
[12199.09s -> 12205.40s]  Now we can just stretch it out a little.
[12206.04s -> 12227.04s]  That's what I want right there.
[12227.92s -> 12244.63s]  Come on, do the dumb thing I want.
[12244.63s -> 12245.59s]  Oh, it's so close.
[12245.59s -> 12246.47s]  No, don't touch that.
[12249.06s -> 12250.02s]  It's so close.
[12250.58s -> 12303.04s]  Oh, I like it.
[12303.04s -> 12306.34s]  I think that's all right.
[12306.34s -> 12316.10s]  I almost had it broken up a little bit more.
[12316.10s -> 12317.06s]  Let me look at it one more time.
[12317.62s -> 12323.78s]  Definitely doesn't need to be that bright.
[12323.78s -> 12328.02s]  Are you kidding me?
[12329.28s -> 12330.32s]  Like, are you kidding me?
[12339.33s -> 12341.89s]  There's a goddamn old one under there.
[12341.89s -> 12368.00s]  How does that look?
[12368.56s -> 12375.56s]  I like it like that.
[12376.20s -> 12378.95s]  And then check this.
[12378.95s -> 12379.83s]  What we're going to do is this.
[12383.43s -> 12386.77s]  I'm going to mess that up a little bit more.
[12392.20s -> 12393.08s]  Need a little bit more.
[12393.08s -> 12393.56s]  We need a...
[12394.52s -> 12395.72s]  Okay, clones.
[12395.72s -> 12396.92s]  We need less clones.
[12397.64s -> 12402.37s]  That's so much better.
[12402.37s -> 12402.85s]  Look at that.
[12403.57s -> 12406.45s]  I love it.
[12406.45s -> 12407.65s]  I don't think I want to change anything.
[12408.37s -> 12412.52s]  Except for that.
[12412.52s -> 12413.24s]  Fuck.
[12413.24s -> 12448.20s]  I got it.
[12457.75s -> 12458.79s]  And wait, wait, wait, wait.
[12458.79s -> 12459.19s]  That's not all.
[12459.19s -> 12459.67s]  That's not all.
[12459.67s -> 12460.39s]  Hold on.
[12460.39s -> 12465.92s]  I'm going to loosen it up a little.
[12465.92s -> 12466.80s]  So it doesn't look so...
[12467.36s -> 12474.95s]  Let's see how that looks.
[12485.22s -> 12485.70s]  Ruined?
[12485.70s -> 12486.50s]  What do you mean ruined?
[12486.50s -> 12487.14s]  Did I ruin it?
[12489.17s -> 12489.89s]  It's a little too...
[12489.89s -> 12490.85s]  Yeah, a little too much.
[12490.85s -> 12491.57s]  Okay, what about...
[12492.71s -> 12494.07s]  Okay, this is important.
[12494.55s -> 12498.26s]  No, it's not.
[12498.26s -> 12498.66s]  This is...
[12498.66s -> 12499.06s]  Here we go.
[12499.06s -> 12499.86s]  Let's try roughing it up.
[12504.39s -> 12505.27s]  Oops.
[12505.27s -> 12506.31s]  Wow, look at that ice.
[12518.02s -> 12519.06s]  And it made it perfect.
[12519.62s -> 12537.48s]  That's perfect.
[12537.48s -> 12538.76s]  Loosen it up a little bit, though.
[12539.32s -> 12546.44s]  That doesn't need to be as harsh.
[12549.99s -> 12551.19s]  Now I have to change the sky.
[12552.98s -> 12553.38s]  I will.
[12553.38s -> 12553.78s]  I will.
[12553.78s -> 12554.50s]  Don't worry.
[12554.50s -> 12554.90s]  I will.
[12555.62s -> 12576.08s]  All right.
[12576.08s -> 12583.44s]  Let's get a sun over here.
[12583.44s -> 12585.73s]  How do I cover the...
[12585.73s -> 12586.37s]  Hmm.
[12586.37s -> 12589.70s]  More trees that look bad in just one corner?
[12592.60s -> 12593.64s]  Yeah, you're right.
[12593.64s -> 12595.78s]  You're right.
[12595.78s -> 12596.26s]  You're right.
[12596.26s -> 12596.74s]  No, you are.
[12597.46s -> 12606.15s]  I'm going to say let's get over here maybe.
[12606.15s -> 12614.31s]  We're going to play around with some scale here, guys.
[12614.31s -> 12615.11s]  Watch this shit.
[12624.34s -> 12626.10s]  That could be like a fucking mile away.
[12626.98s -> 12647.11s]  What am I making?
[12647.11s -> 12649.27s]  Oh, it's just kind of whatever at this point.
[12649.91s -> 12650.87s]  I don't really have a plan.
[12650.87s -> 12652.47s]  I'm just kind of making random stuff.
[12653.43s -> 12656.10s]  Move this around though.
[12656.10s -> 12657.14s]  It looks too perfect.
[12658.02s -> 12671.27s]  Yeah, this has got to go on the ground.
[12672.39s -> 12677.52s]  I can put a little forest back here.
[12686.93s -> 12689.09s]  Yeah, that looks bad.
[12700.37s -> 12700.69s]  Don't worry.
[12700.69s -> 12702.53s]  I'm going to go in here and I'm going to ruffle them up.
[12702.53s -> 12719.16s]  Coming together over there.
[12719.16s -> 12722.26s]  Although this is a little too big.
[12722.90s -> 12727.28s]  Did I walk something up here?
[12727.84s -> 12731.14s]  Oh, I did.
[12732.37s -> 12732.69s]  Oops.
[12733.49s -> 12751.46s]  Are the shirts a limited time?
[12751.46s -> 12752.34s]  No, they're here forever.
[12752.90s -> 12755.67s]  I got to get the giant hair?
[12755.67s -> 12756.39s]  I will.
[12756.39s -> 12765.44s]  Let me see the whole thing.
[12765.44s -> 12766.08s]  What is this?
[12766.72s -> 12776.29s]  I feel like I want to...
[12776.29s -> 12777.41s]  All right.
[12777.41s -> 12778.45s]  Hear me out on this one.
[12817.99s -> 12821.41s]  It's just a little too perfect for me.
[12822.21s -> 12827.84s]  That's okay.
[12827.84s -> 12829.92s]  Let's do the snow too.
[12830.56s -> 12844.80s]  That's kind of cool looking.
[12845.44s -> 12856.74s]  That is really cool looking actually.
[12858.93s -> 12860.05s]  They're frozen like that.
[12867.64s -> 12871.17s]  No, that's fine.
[12871.17s -> 12872.29s]  It looks okay.
[12872.29s -> 12873.97s]  All right, let's do some work over here.
[12874.45s -> 12884.85s]  This game seems amazing if you can't draw and want to make art for fun.
[12888.08s -> 12890.88s]  All you have seen me do is just dick around.
[12890.88s -> 12891.44s]  That's it.
[12891.44s -> 12892.40s]  I haven't done anything else.
[12893.12s -> 12901.01s]  I've done nothing else but dick around.
[12901.57s -> 12905.59s]  Let's do a little bit of work here though.
[12905.59s -> 12906.31s]  Because I need...
[12906.31s -> 12907.35s]  You need hair.
[12907.35s -> 12917.72s]  What kind of hair though?
[12919.04s -> 12919.92s]  Snap it to...
[12920.96s -> 12921.36s]  Yep.
[12928.23s -> 12929.03s]  Studio lighting.
[12929.03s -> 12930.15s]  I want to change the lights.
[12930.79s -> 12932.23s]  There has to be a way I can do that.
[12933.03s -> 12933.59s]  Has to be.
[12935.43s -> 12935.75s]  Right?
[12936.31s -> 12940.32s]  All right, hair.
[12941.04s -> 12946.64s]  He has made it a metal or stone or whatever it's going to end up being.
[12947.44s -> 12952.37s]  He looks like Beaker.
[12952.37s -> 12954.05s]  Yeah, he's really not really supposed to be here.
[12968.64s -> 12969.92s]  Wait, why is it...
[12972.10s -> 12974.10s]  Oh, it's because it's shiny metal hair.
[12976.31s -> 12977.19s]  Okay, right.
[12978.16s -> 12978.80s]  Makes sense.
[12979.52s -> 12988.71s]  Why do I feel like this is going to take up all the frame rate?
[13009.91s -> 13012.71s]  This looks like the shittiest toupee you could ever wear.
[13012.71s -> 13027.76s]  Am I going to change this?
[13029.64s -> 13030.04s]  Oops.
[13030.60s -> 13035.84s]  Well, that's fine.
[13035.84s -> 13036.80s]  Who cares?
[13036.80s -> 13041.06s]  I'm going to have like a little spike.
[13049.24s -> 13050.52s]  No, it's a bird's nest.
[13050.52s -> 13060.90s]  I'm just going to put a bird in here.
[13079.83s -> 13084.31s]  He punched him so hard at his hair.
[13084.31s -> 13093.52s]  Okay, well, it's because I'm drawing in 3D.
[13093.52s -> 13095.04s]  It's because I have snapping on.
[13095.04s -> 13108.29s]  Fuck it, let's go wild with this shit.
[13108.29s -> 13108.93s]  Wild, yeah.
[13108.93s -> 13110.29s]  You know, wild I say.
[13110.29s -> 13149.40s]  He has cosmic horror hair.
[13163.51s -> 13172.16s]  You can't even tell what's going on from over here.
[13172.16s -> 13174.32s]  Dude, I've got a fucking idea.
[13174.32s -> 13175.28s]  Are you serious?
[13175.28s -> 13176.16s]  You know what I'm going to do?
[13176.16s -> 13177.12s]  Are you serious?
[13178.21s -> 13179.33s]  I'm going to have it just...
[13179.33s -> 13180.05s]  No, never mind.
[13180.05s -> 13181.49s]  It's going to take like about three hours.
[13182.29s -> 13191.70s]  I definitely have to make his hair flowing like crazy though.
[13192.34s -> 13197.22s]  And he needs more hair up here.
[13207.54s -> 13209.86s]  Smaller, smaller flex here.
[13209.86s -> 13211.46s]  This is kind of getting out of hand.
[13212.02s -> 13214.05s]  And I'm going to turn off the snapping.
[13245.97s -> 13247.57s]  That's part of the platformer.
[13249.09s -> 13250.05s]  Look, wait, wait.
[13250.05s -> 13251.01s]  Oh, boy.
[13251.01s -> 13251.49s]  More...
[13251.49s -> 13252.29s]  Oh, it's a step.
[13252.29s -> 13253.17s]  Turning this into a level.
[13253.89s -> 13260.40s]  You have to jump through here.
[13260.40s -> 13262.40s]  You got to go around the whole goddamn robot.
[13262.96s -> 13269.81s]  The whole thing is going to be scalable.
[13279.96s -> 13280.92s]  Yeah, you got to run up his hair.
[13281.48s -> 13285.06s]  So check this out.
[13285.06s -> 13285.54s]  All right.
[13285.54s -> 13289.94s]  Hold on.
[13289.94s -> 13292.53s]  Down and like flowing down.
[13292.53s -> 13293.97s]  I need to see from a clear angle.
[13294.53s -> 13301.35s]  Flow it down and come across.
[13302.31s -> 13303.48s]  Now, let's go.
[13303.48s -> 13304.84s]  Okay, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[13304.84s -> 13305.80s]  The hair is going to...
[13306.44s -> 13307.96s]  There's going to be another thing going on right here.
[13308.60s -> 13314.88s]  We'll do that later.
[13315.44s -> 13318.04s]  We're going to make a head right here.
[13322.88s -> 13323.36s]  God damn it.
[13323.36s -> 13324.24s]  This is so in the way.
[13325.86s -> 13326.34s]  It's okay.
[13326.98s -> 13356.16s]  It's just like a tiny head.
[13356.88s -> 13389.19s]  Okay.
[13435.40s -> 13436.44s]  Is this on Steam?
[13436.44s -> 13437.24s]  No, it's not.
[13437.24s -> 13440.04s]  It's only for PlayStation 4, which is very unfortunate.
[13440.04s -> 13447.75s]  The eyes need to be bigger.
[13447.75s -> 13457.75s]  Nah, I like it better like this.
[13457.75s -> 13460.88s]  He looks like a pumpkin.
[13460.88s -> 13462.24s]  Just wait.
[13463.76s -> 13471.73s]  Um, a party hat.
[13477.54s -> 13478.50s]  It's a baseball cap.
[13479.06s -> 13514.20s]  Okay.
[13514.20s -> 13525.57s]  Now he needs to be metal.
[13525.57s -> 13544.61s]  He's a Tintin.
[13544.61s -> 13549.70s]  He's got to have one on like a purple hat.
[13550.34s -> 13570.88s]  Whoa, wheezy.
[13571.52s -> 13574.29s]  It's the Iron Giant.
[13576.39s -> 13578.47s]  It kind of is the Iron Giant in a way.
[13578.47s -> 13579.03s]  All right.
[13579.03s -> 13580.15s]  Apply the finish.
[13580.15s -> 13585.48s]  I want shiny metal, but I do not want it to be that stupid thing.
[13585.48s -> 13588.04s]  I want it to be the like spray can.
[13589.00s -> 13591.51s]  I don't know why it's on this dumb thing.
[13592.31s -> 13597.62s]  It's on like the spray can.
[13604.80s -> 13606.00s]  How did I get it off this before?
[13606.88s -> 13609.54s]  I just wanted to do it.
[13610.26s -> 13611.78s]  How did I get it off this before?
[13611.78s -> 13612.26s]  I don't remember.
[13613.14s -> 13614.10s]  It's over here.
[13614.10s -> 13617.89s]  Apply finish.
[13617.89s -> 13619.96s]  Let's make him nice and shiny.
[13629.04s -> 13629.84s]  I don't like the color.
[13640.21s -> 13640.69s]  No.
[13640.69s -> 13642.05s]  Let's go back to like metal.
[13643.01s -> 13644.37s]  The actual kind of chrome look.
[13645.09s -> 13657.40s]  He looks like he's made out of wood.
[13658.04s -> 13659.72s]  His head needs to be a little bigger too.
[13660.36s -> 13684.66s]  Okay.
[13684.66s -> 13694.32s]  Okay.
[13694.96s -> 13698.29s]  He's Mario.
[13700.26s -> 13702.42s]  He looks like a Roblox character.
[13703.14s -> 13704.34s]  All right.
[13704.34s -> 13705.46s]  Now we're getting somewhere.
[13707.09s -> 13709.73s]  Now we need a face over here because that's his hand.
[13710.37s -> 13733.43s]  I need to see from the other side.
[13733.43s -> 13733.91s]  Here we go.
[13754.87s -> 13756.87s]  Have him peeking over with a big nose.
[13758.07s -> 13760.31s]  You mean like that cartoon character?
[13765.91s -> 13767.59s]  That weird cartoon nose thing.
[13767.59s -> 13767.83s]  All right.
[13767.83s -> 13771.08s]  Where's the hand right here?
[13771.64s -> 13807.57s]  Okay.
[13815.24s -> 13815.88s]  Now this.
[13816.44s -> 13824.10s]  This is where we set up the blending options.
[13824.74s -> 13830.82s]  Here we go.
[13830.82s -> 13831.46s]  Edit shape.
[13832.10s -> 13833.68s]  That needs to be stamped.
[13833.68s -> 13834.88s]  It needs to be stamped.
[13834.88s -> 13837.94s]  It's this mirror.
[13837.94s -> 13838.42s]  Back it up.
[13843.16s -> 13843.64s]  Stamp.
[13844.93s -> 13845.49s]  Okay.
[13845.49s -> 13850.00s]  Now I should be able to do weird shit with this nose.
[13850.64s -> 13859.00s]  Why not try to sculpt natural looking faces?
[13859.56s -> 13863.12s]  I mean because I'm trying to get used to the tools.
[13863.84s -> 13867.32s]  You want me to make like a natural looking face?
[13868.12s -> 13872.68s]  I just figured out how to pan like yesterday.
[13873.32s -> 13882.96s]  Okay.
[13882.96s -> 13883.84s]  Blend amount.
[13884.48s -> 13889.19s]  Let's see what this does because now I should be able to.
[13890.07s -> 13891.73s]  Okay.
[13891.73s -> 13892.45s]  Let me see here.
[13893.25s -> 13897.64s]  Yeah.
[13897.64s -> 13898.12s]  Look at this.
[13910.98s -> 13911.46s]  Where is it?
[13912.10s -> 13921.57s]  He's got to come out a little further.
[13921.57s -> 13921.97s]  Hold on.
[13939.19s -> 13942.61s]  This is not what I thought was going to be here.
[13948.04s -> 13949.96s]  You can't even see this guy.
[13951.22s -> 13975.64s]  It's got to be much smaller.
[13975.64s -> 13976.04s]  There you go.
[13976.04s -> 13980.84s]  That's better because it's going to get squished into here.
[13980.84s -> 13992.71s]  Okay.
[13992.71s -> 13993.51s]  What does that look like?
[13994.07s -> 13999.73s]  That's not bad.
[14014.87s -> 14015.75s]  That's not a tongue.
[14016.39s -> 14018.48s]  This has to go down.
[14023.35s -> 14023.83s]  I'm going to have to.
[14023.83s -> 14024.15s]  Yeah.
[14024.15s -> 14025.59s]  This has to be changed.
[14025.59s -> 14033.86s]  I actually think I can do it like this.
[14039.62s -> 14040.90s]  That looks fine.
[14040.90s -> 14047.43s]  Okay.
[14047.43s -> 14048.79s]  Make nostrils.
[14048.79s -> 14052.47s]  Well, no, I can't make nostrils because the nostrils are both flat down.
[14052.47s -> 14054.07s]  Like sniffing the mountain.
[14055.11s -> 14067.89s]  Yeah.
[14067.89s -> 14068.53s]  He's going like.
[14071.49s -> 14072.13s]  I'm going to look.
[14072.13s -> 14072.69s]  I'll show you.
[14073.25s -> 14088.76s]  Let me let's I got to go back and finish this.
[14089.48s -> 14139.12s]  No.
[14139.12s -> 14141.68s]  His eyes are bugging out of his head and he's staring at the mountain.
[14141.68s -> 14155.40s]  What does this need to be?
[14155.40s -> 14156.55s]  Like that.
[14156.55s -> 14157.11s]  Down here.
[14157.75s -> 14173.91s]  A little bit more to the right.
[14173.91s -> 14174.63s]  Like over here.
[14175.43s -> 14179.35s]  Like that.
[14179.91s -> 14185.46s]  Okay.
[14189.72s -> 14190.68s]  Nose is here.
[14191.40s -> 14194.87s]  I mean, I could put the nostrils here.
[14195.59s -> 14196.85s]  You know.
[14199.57s -> 14200.21s]  What mouth?
[14211.72s -> 14212.12s]  Maybe.
[14212.12s -> 14213.56s]  Maybe have it like over here.
[14213.56s -> 14213.80s]  Yeah.
[14214.60s -> 14226.07s]  I don't hate it.
[14226.07s -> 14236.02s]  Let me just see.
[14245.00s -> 14245.88s]  He's taking a bite.
[14245.88s -> 14246.84s]  No, he's just going like.
[14248.12s -> 14254.58s]  All right.
[14254.58s -> 14257.46s]  That means I don't know what the fuck's going on over here.
[14258.02s -> 14262.61s]  I'm going to have to turn these guys, I think, a little and bring them down.
[14268.95s -> 14269.67s]  Hand.
[14269.67s -> 14275.01s]  All right.
[14275.01s -> 14278.18s]  Let's do the eyes.
[14278.18s -> 14278.98s]  Those are important.
[14279.62s -> 14284.58s]  Let's get right where we need to be.
[14284.58s -> 14285.54s]  Right here.
[14291.20s -> 14291.68s]  Excuse me.
[14291.68s -> 14292.56s]  What just happened?
[14292.56s -> 14293.36s]  What's going on here?
[14294.80s -> 14300.07s]  Oh, okay.
[14300.07s -> 14302.47s]  Let's get the paint tool.
[14302.47s -> 14303.11s]  Spray paint.
[14304.07s -> 14309.25s]  And let's scare the shit out of everybody that's here.
[14319.38s -> 14326.05s]  Because if you weren't concerned right now, you will be very soon.
[14326.85s -> 14353.24s]  Just be lower like this.
[14357.57s -> 14358.87s]  Okay.
[14358.87s -> 14360.15s]  Let's get some blue.
[14360.15s -> 14363.11s]  Or, I don't know, black.
[14363.11s -> 14391.40s]  Because eyeballs fade into the stalks.
[14391.40s -> 14394.58s]  Okay.
[14401.16s -> 14402.52s]  That eye is going to be pointed down.
[14403.16s -> 14405.72s]  Like down here.
[14405.72s -> 14410.10s]  Back it up.
[14410.42s -> 14411.80s]  Um, why am I?
[14411.80s -> 14412.52s]  What is going on?
[14413.08s -> 14415.35s]  I come back here.
[14416.16s -> 14416.80s]  Where are you going?
[14417.44s -> 14422.04s]  That needs to be, like, crazed.
[14434.31s -> 14435.27s]  Much better.
[14435.27s -> 14442.31s]  Okay.
[14445.60s -> 14446.16s]  I wonder.
[14446.16s -> 14450.08s]  Okay, so I'm not going to make him not flesh-colored.
[14451.12s -> 14453.36s]  He needs to be metal.
[14457.38s -> 14458.66s]  Let's make it fucking even weirder.
[14475.83s -> 14476.95s]  I don't think I can do that.
[14476.95s -> 14477.75s]  No, that's all right.
[14477.75s -> 14478.23s]  No, that's all right.
[14478.23s -> 14478.95s]  I can leave it as is.
[14480.79s -> 14482.23s]  Can we use eyebrows?
[14482.23s -> 14484.31s]  Yeah, I'll paint them on after.
[14485.11s -> 14487.12s]  Maybe it should just be a big guy.
[14487.12s -> 14488.48s]  Maybe it's just not even a robot.
[14489.04s -> 14491.04s]  Although that would kind of break all the continuity.
[14491.60s -> 14493.04s]  Like there ever was one to begin with.
[14497.46s -> 14498.98s]  Give him more eyes.
[14499.78s -> 14500.28s]  No.
[14500.90s -> 14509.06s]  I got another three eyes pointing down.
[14509.06s -> 14510.90s]  Just not, not yet, not yet, not yet.
[14510.90s -> 14511.62s]  Hold on.
[14511.62s -> 14515.83s]  I need to figure out.
[14515.83s -> 14522.95s]  All right, so he's this kind of chrome, almost bronze.
[14523.59s -> 14527.70s]  Let's go in here.
[14527.70s -> 14537.49s]  Let's get that coat of almost like a bronze.
[14538.21s -> 14539.46s]  Like this.
[14540.18s -> 14557.72s]  I have the finish.
[14570.88s -> 14572.24s]  Now that's fucking crazy.
[14572.88s -> 14585.48s]  Maybe I might light him up a little bit.
[14585.48s -> 14586.60s]  Let's make, hold on.
[14587.88s -> 14593.25s]  Maybe like gold.
[14593.81s -> 14595.09s]  Yeah, this guy's going to be gold.
[14595.89s -> 14600.31s]  Oh no, his eyes.
[14600.31s -> 14601.27s]  I can fix them.
[14601.27s -> 14615.36s]  I'm not making you gold.
[14616.08s -> 14618.04s]  There we go.
[14618.04s -> 14637.64s]  All right, now let's do the finish again.
[14638.36s -> 14641.53s]  Okay.
[14647.91s -> 14649.91s]  I lost a little bit of the gold.
[14649.91s -> 14651.75s]  Maybe I should lighten him up to a little bit more.
[14651.75s -> 14652.55s]  Maybe that'll be better.
[14654.02s -> 14654.58s]  No.
[14654.58s -> 14657.32s]  I need like a brighter yellow.
[14658.82s -> 14659.78s]  He's not cheese.
[14662.74s -> 14664.42s]  Gold is like this.
[14666.56s -> 14668.24s]  But I don't know if I can get,
[14668.24s -> 14670.40s]  it might have to just be this kind of mustardy yellow.
[14671.04s -> 14676.71s]  I'm going to save the color.
[14688.84s -> 14692.92s]  Just doesn't look the same.
[14692.92s -> 14693.96s]  Doesn't look right with the,
[14694.68s -> 14695.80s]  I guess that's close enough.
[14704.24s -> 14706.40s]  No, that's just, I think that because of the finish.
[14708.82s -> 14710.26s]  Let me remove some of the finish.
[14710.98s -> 14719.57s]  That's a, that's better.
[14719.57s -> 14721.01s]  All right, there's gold.
[14722.29s -> 14727.06s]  Now let's go back to the eyes.
[14727.86s -> 14734.28s]  And we'll make the eyes gold too.
[14734.92s -> 14745.24s]  Maybe I should make them like physical.
[14750.48s -> 14752.08s]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[14752.08s -> 14773.89s]  Wait, what is it?
[14773.89s -> 14781.06s]  I was wondering why it looked like that.
[14781.62s -> 14783.97s]  It's because it's metal.
[14783.97s -> 14787.49s]  I don't want, let's just do default or plastic.
[14787.49s -> 14788.29s]  That's better, okay.
[14809.27s -> 14810.79s]  Fucking ice cream face.
[14822.21s -> 14824.21s]  Oh God.
[14824.21s -> 14826.05s]  Great Lord Walden just gave,
[14826.05s -> 14827.25s]  I think I'm going to spray paint it.
[14827.25s -> 14830.24s]  It just doesn't look right.
[14830.24s -> 14833.03s]  What are you doing?
[14833.03s -> 14835.51s]  Great Lord Walden is just giving 20 community subs
[14835.51s -> 14836.55s]  over and over again.
[14836.55s -> 14838.02s]  Twice in a row.
[14838.02s -> 14839.14s]  Holy shit, dude.
[14839.14s -> 14846.98s]  Thank you for the 40 community subs.
[14846.98s -> 14848.34s]  Make it have eyelids.
[14848.34s -> 14851.06s]  And let me paint it for a sec,
[14851.06s -> 14853.14s]  but that's a lot of fucking subs, dude.
[14853.14s -> 14853.62s]  Thank you.
[14855.16s -> 14857.00s]  That's an insane amount of subs.
[14857.00s -> 14860.76s]  Get it back out.
[14861.48s -> 14864.76s]  How do you know when you get one?
[14864.76s -> 14866.04s]  Like as I look over and I see
[14867.24s -> 14868.68s]  it then blowing up in the chat.
[14872.53s -> 14873.57s]  Let's get the spray paint.
[14877.14s -> 14878.50s]  It's going to be easier to do it like this.
[14883.03s -> 14884.63s]  Circle, okay.
[14884.63s -> 14892.52s]  Reason why it's not showing up.
[14893.08s -> 14894.36s]  Any guesses?
[14895.08s -> 14896.90s]  Hmm.
[14896.90s -> 14902.10s]  I have it on paint can.
[14902.98s -> 14905.59s]  Hmm.
[14906.23s -> 14910.10s]  Why am I missing something here?
[14910.10s -> 14927.16s]  Maybe I need to just make it again.
[14927.16s -> 14928.44s]  Maybe I have to, let me see.
[14930.74s -> 14931.54s]  New sculpture?
[14933.59s -> 14934.71s]  No, it's just not coming up at all.
[14935.51s -> 14939.19s]  It's weird.
[14940.79s -> 14943.52s]  Maybe it's because I had the coat on already.
[14945.16s -> 14946.44s]  I'll just do it the way I had it before.
[14960.40s -> 14962.16s]  That's actually fucking horrifying.
[14962.16s -> 14962.96s]  So I'm going to keep it.
[14982.72s -> 14983.60s]  That was white, right?
[14984.40s -> 14994.95s]  Why do you look like that?
[14995.67s -> 14998.16s]  You're not metal.
[14998.16s -> 15005.44s]  Why are you doing this to me?
[15009.80s -> 15011.24s]  Well, oh, I got to move on.
[15011.24s -> 15012.04s]  I don't know what's going on.
[15012.04s -> 15013.40s]  I don't know why this is doing this.
[15014.28s -> 15018.31s]  I have no idea, but I got to move on.
[15019.03s -> 15049.96s]  God damn it.
[15049.96s -> 15050.92s]  All right, I got to pee.
[15050.92s -> 15052.52s]  This is driving me nuts.
[15052.52s -> 15053.24s]  I'll be right back.
[15313.32s -> 15313.64s]  Hey.
[15318.36s -> 15319.16s]  All right.
[15319.16s -> 15321.09s]  So what I'm going to do next,
[15322.42s -> 15323.70s]  I'm going to put a cap on this one.
[15326.40s -> 15327.52s]  Just kid this.
[15327.52s -> 15329.04s]  When I just came back, I just saw this.
[15331.14s -> 15332.42s]  I'm going to save this one
[15332.42s -> 15333.46s]  because I want to try something.
[15336.42s -> 15338.90s]  I want to try to mold my face.
[15339.54s -> 15353.11s]  I just want to see.
[15359.38s -> 15360.90s]  I want to just go make a guy
[15360.90s -> 15362.10s]  and walk around the world.
[15372.12s -> 15373.08s]  So pretty.
[15378.71s -> 15380.31s]  Mold my butt first.
[15380.31s -> 15381.75s]  I'm not going to mold my ass.
[15382.47s -> 15387.84s]  Just drop a puppet in.
[15388.93s -> 15390.05s]  Yeah, I wonder.
[15390.05s -> 15390.93s]  Let me see.
[15390.93s -> 15394.20s]  Let's go back to edit mode.
[15394.76s -> 15398.18s]  Yeah, let's drop a puppet in.
[15401.11s -> 15402.39s]  How do I do that?
[15402.39s -> 15404.39s]  Is it under guides, gadgets?
[15405.51s -> 15406.31s]  Gadgets, right?
[15408.56s -> 15409.36s]  Gameplay gear.
[15411.01s -> 15413.80s]  And it is one of these.
[15413.80s -> 15415.88s]  Blank puppet, blank puppet, puppet.
[15415.88s -> 15416.60s]  Yeah, one of these.
[15417.40s -> 15423.04s]  Don't step on the ice.
[15423.04s -> 15424.64s]  You can make like death zones too.
[15427.54s -> 15428.02s]  Here we go.
[15435.73s -> 15438.05s]  Well, the camera needs to be adjusted.
[15438.05s -> 15439.65s]  He's going way too fast.
[15440.37s -> 15445.64s]  There's no collision on those.
[15445.64s -> 15450.64s]  How do I adjust the camera?
[15450.64s -> 15456.21s]  Oh, go back to edit mode.
[15456.21s -> 15457.33s]  I want to like pull the camera in.
[15461.14s -> 15462.58s]  You have to be adjusted here.
[15463.46s -> 15465.22s]  Turn speed, movement speed.
[15467.04s -> 15468.24s]  It's way too fast.
[15468.32s -> 15470.08s]  Run speed, way too fast.
[15472.42s -> 15473.62s]  Okay, jump height.
[15475.49s -> 15477.01s]  I'm just realizing something right now.
[15480.96s -> 15482.48s]  I think this is very small.
[15485.08s -> 15488.36s]  This whole thing is only this big.
[15491.78s -> 15492.66s]  It's tiny.
[15495.56s -> 15498.12s]  It's very, very, very small.
[15503.70s -> 15506.44s]  Oops, I can scale it all up,
[15506.44s -> 15508.84s]  but I can scale everything down too.
[15508.84s -> 15509.96s]  That's the next part, right?
[15512.04s -> 15513.64s]  Okay, so now I want to...
[15514.36s -> 15518.24s]  Upper body, movement, behavior.
[15518.96s -> 15520.72s]  What is like camera?
[15521.44s -> 15525.72s]  I know that exists somewhere.
[15530.18s -> 15531.62s]  I've not done any of this yet.
[15532.34s -> 15538.47s]  Collision, labels, audio.
[15540.61s -> 15542.05s]  Yeah, you can make it first person.
[15542.05s -> 15544.05s]  It's just that I didn't do that.
[15544.05s -> 15546.21s]  I don't even know if the tutorials exist to do that.
[15546.93s -> 15550.85s]  That's something I would need to learn
[15551.65s -> 15554.34s]  kind of on my own time, I guess.
[15554.98s -> 15558.42s]  Because I don't know if there's any camera options.
[15559.06s -> 15566.12s]  But regardless, let's just stick around again.
[15566.92s -> 15574.64s]  That guy's so weird.
[15576.08s -> 15576.64s]  Oh, it's over here.
[15577.68s -> 15578.40s]  Nice trees.
[15578.40s -> 15579.52s]  Who made these trees?
[15579.52s -> 15580.48s]  These look pretty good.
[15581.20s -> 15593.62s]  I don't think I can make the jump over here through the ice.
[15603.73s -> 15604.61s]  Oops.
[15604.61s -> 15610.80s]  Oh, there you go.
[15612.37s -> 15616.05s]  This is the first actual real attempt I've really made.
[15619.72s -> 15620.84s]  Yeah, I can make the...
[15620.84s -> 15621.80s]  I can have collision under there.
[15621.80s -> 15623.24s]  But this was not supposed to be a game.
[15623.24s -> 15625.00s]  This was just me messing with the sculpting tool
[15625.00s -> 15626.04s]  and moving stuff around.
[15631.04s -> 15634.20s]  Yeah, now let's try something else.
[15634.20s -> 15635.81s]  I want to save this though.
[15642.96s -> 15648.05s]  Me, who cares?
[15648.69s -> 15658.74s]  Okay, so this has been saved.
[15658.74s -> 15659.38s]  Remix.
[15662.63s -> 15663.11s]  Save it.
[15663.11s -> 15663.75s]  It's saved.
[15663.75s -> 15664.55s]  Exit creation.
[15666.37s -> 15669.14s]  Okay, let me try this.
[15669.14s -> 15670.02s]  I want to just do this.
[15670.66s -> 15672.63s]  You can make like effects.
[15673.35s -> 15675.11s]  I could be sculptures and shit.
[15675.11s -> 15676.79s]  I don't even know how the hell you would do that.
[15680.20s -> 15681.16s]  Make a vehicle.
[15683.30s -> 15684.18s]  Make a song.
[15686.92s -> 15688.60s]  All right, music timeline.
[15689.32s -> 15693.43s]  It's got eight bars.
[15693.43s -> 15694.31s]  Let's drag it out.
[15694.95s -> 15698.18s]  Let's just go with like 16.
[15700.77s -> 15707.40s]  Okay, now I need search.
[15709.06s -> 15711.14s]  Search for music clips.
[15716.79s -> 15717.35s]  Animals.
[15719.06s -> 15719.86s]  No results.
[15722.88s -> 15723.60s]  Outer space.
[15723.60s -> 15724.56s]  What do you mean no results?
[15725.20s -> 15732.55s]  Collections.
[15733.11s -> 15736.40s]  What are you talking about?
[15737.12s -> 15748.21s]  So here's like media molecules little collection of clips.
[15752.84s -> 15753.80s]  Music tracks.
[15753.80s -> 15754.52s]  Music clips.
[15755.16s -> 15755.80s]  Start here.
[15759.43s -> 15759.91s]  Loops.
[15760.71s -> 15761.19s]  Drums.
[15765.92s -> 15766.80s]  Bass tracks.
[15767.76s -> 15768.80s]  Chords.
[15768.80s -> 15769.68s]  Rhythm section.
[15771.12s -> 15772.32s]  Okay, let's do drums.
[15780.60s -> 15784.04s]  Popsicle break beat.
[15784.60s -> 15792.10s]  Whatever this is has to be played the whole time I sculpt my face.
[15792.82s -> 15797.16s]  I'm going to try to do every detail.
[15797.80s -> 15804.44s]  Popsicle.
[15805.00s -> 15807.08s]  Okay, we'll do popsicle.
[15807.08s -> 15818.80s]  Let's add.
[15822.58s -> 15823.62s]  Let's get back in here.
[15828.56s -> 15832.96s]  Hmm, we're back.
[15832.96s -> 15835.36s]  Let's go to chords.
[15836.16s -> 15845.24s]  Yeah, this really is just GarageBand.
[15845.24s -> 15846.76s]  You can make your own stuff.
[15846.76s -> 15848.04s]  I don't know how to do that yet though.
[15848.76s -> 15876.15s]  Hey, this doesn't suck.
[15876.87s -> 15883.72s]  All right, let's change.
[15883.72s -> 15884.68s]  Let's mess with this though.
[15885.64s -> 15888.13s]  So we got pitch.
[15913.54s -> 15915.94s]  Well, I didn't, I'm not adding this part.
[15915.94s -> 15917.22s]  What is doing that?
[15917.22s -> 15926.53s]  All right, well that sounds all right.
[15926.53s -> 15937.25s]  What else we got?
[15937.25s -> 15938.61s]  Distant traffic.
[15938.61s -> 15960.07s]  Okay, let's fade that out.
[15961.03s -> 15969.96s]  I'm putting the Bohemian Rhapsody sample.
[15971.16s -> 15976.50s]  This is the beginning.
[15976.50s -> 15981.62s]  Bang!
[15981.62s -> 15982.47s]  Right here.
[15994.84s -> 15996.04s]  Lightning strike.
[15996.04s -> 15999.81s]  I need to go search by categories.
[16000.53s -> 16002.10s]  Projectiles.
[16004.16s -> 16006.96s]  Crossbow.
[16009.16s -> 16010.98s]  Pew Blaster.
[16011.94s -> 16016.04s]  We need special effects.
[16020.16s -> 16028.26s]  Wait, you got it.
[16032.79s -> 16040.04s]  And then get the other one.
[16041.64s -> 16048.47s]  Oh my god, that was fucking long.
[16049.35s -> 16050.32s]  Which one of these?
[16050.32s -> 16051.28s]  This is the first explosion.
[16051.28s -> 16052.40s]  I don't want this part.
[16052.40s -> 16053.20s]  No, actually I do.
[16054.32s -> 16055.12s]  Just get in here.
[16058.12s -> 16059.08s]  Just, I just need one.
[16071.60s -> 16079.64s]  That's just too loud.
[16095.83s -> 16097.67s]  I don't know why that's so loud.
[16097.67s -> 16106.56s]  Playback speed.
[16106.56s -> 16108.56s]  Like, does it have to be that loud?
[16109.12s -> 16114.16s]  And this is only going to happen for like a second, right?
[16119.81s -> 16121.25s]  Can I put the timeline here?
[16121.25s -> 16123.75s]  Yeah, I want to play from here.
[16124.39s -> 16144.44s]  Okay, now let's go back here.
[16145.16s -> 16146.76s]  Can you do your own voice?
[16146.76s -> 16147.72s]  Yes, you can.
[16147.72s -> 16157.09s]  I need like a heavy guitar.
[16157.65s -> 16165.57s]  Go back to the main menu here.
[16168.90s -> 16173.32s]  I need this most recent, no, tags.
[16174.90s -> 16175.54s]  Animals.
[16176.66s -> 16177.70s]  Starting point.
[16177.70s -> 16179.46s]  Phases, phrases and loops.
[16179.46s -> 16179.86s]  Track.
[16180.90s -> 16184.02s]  It just turns into Africa.
[16190.26s -> 16192.18s]  I think this is kind of broken right now.
[16192.82s -> 16197.86s]  Collections.
[16198.42s -> 16209.51s]  Because if I go to all, I want to do categories.
[16210.23s -> 16211.64s]  Category music.
[16212.44s -> 16212.92s]  Tag.
[16212.92s -> 16213.88s]  Tags A to Z.
[16215.09s -> 16217.73s]  Blues, animals, classical, like classical.
[16218.47s -> 16218.97s]  Okay.
[16220.50s -> 16222.50s]  Dance, country, it was like rock.
[16223.84s -> 16224.40s]  Heavy metal.
[16225.35s -> 16225.83s]  There we go.
[16230.80s -> 16231.92s]  Turn the game volume back up.
[16234.24s -> 16244.45s]  I like it.
[16245.09s -> 16248.44s]  Let's see.
[16268.96s -> 16269.60s]  What?
[16269.60s -> 16271.20s]  I don't know why it has to be that loud.
[16275.01s -> 16276.45s]  No, no, no, no, back, back, back, back, back, back.
[16282.72s -> 16283.52s]  What does this sound like?
[16283.52s -> 16285.12s]  Why can't I want to play it from here?
[16285.92s -> 16318.88s]  Why is there a dial tone?
[16318.88s -> 16319.36s]  I don't know.
[16319.36s -> 16321.36s]  I'm just putting stuff in just to see.
[16321.36s -> 16322.40s]  I haven't played with this yet.
[16322.96s -> 16343.60s]  The perfect theme song for Jerma Popsicle.
[16352.05s -> 16353.73s]  I don't want this to go all the way.
[16353.73s -> 16362.96s]  These really aren't supposed to be.
[16362.96s -> 16366.16s]  Unless you have a real idea where you're going to make your own song.
[16367.20s -> 16372.96s]  I don't know if more than 16 bars, 24 bars of a loop is a good idea.
[16397.32s -> 16399.16s]  You really need to come in and make your own stuff.
[16399.88s -> 16402.87s]  But I don't really know how to do that yet.
[16403.19s -> 16405.97s]  I don't know how to play around with the timeline, but nothing else.
[16406.77s -> 16415.96s]  All right, let's sculpt my face.
[16416.68s -> 16418.36s]  I'm not going to do music.
[16418.36s -> 16420.60s]  It'll take all day and I don't know how to do it.
[16420.60s -> 16421.80s]  So we're not going to do it.
[16427.68s -> 16429.68s]  So here's what we're going to do.
[16430.32s -> 16434.44s]  That sounds like 2013 Garage Band.
[16435.32s -> 16438.36s]  Yeah, it's probably very similar.
[16438.92s -> 16444.92s]  So here's what we're just going to put on something easy.
[16450.58s -> 16451.30s]  There, there you go.
[16452.42s -> 16458.47s]  So I'm going to try as hard as I can.
[16459.35s -> 16460.93s]  Let's see if I can do it.
[16466.29s -> 16467.81s]  I'm going to try to sculpt my face.
[16469.28s -> 16470.24s]  At least the front part.
[16473.22s -> 16475.30s]  I'm not going to put the explosion on loop.
[16479.32s -> 16480.76s]  I don't even know what camera this is.
[16481.32s -> 16483.16s]  Is this the right camera?
[16483.16s -> 16486.76s]  Let's find out.
[16486.76s -> 16487.16s]  It is.
[16495.28s -> 16497.52s]  So I'm going to just take a screenshot of my face
[16498.24s -> 16503.12s]  and I'm going to try to get it correct.
[16503.12s -> 16509.84s]  So there we go.
[16510.56s -> 16523.41s]  Let me change this and it should show up now.
[16528.13s -> 16530.13s]  Just want a little screenshot.
[16535.51s -> 16537.03s]  Yeah, we'll do the beard too.
[16537.59s -> 16543.40s]  Okay, ready?
[16560.08s -> 16561.20s]  I can't take it.
[16561.20s -> 16562.32s]  How am I supposed to take it?
[16562.32s -> 16566.23s]  Okay, ready?
[16566.23s -> 16567.60s]  I got an idea.
[16567.60s -> 16578.74s]  Okay, got the screenshot.
[16580.18s -> 16581.46s]  Get a profile shot too.
[16586.13s -> 16587.09s]  Hold on, hold on.
[16587.09s -> 16589.57s]  I can't do all that at once.
[16596.23s -> 16597.19s]  Is it out of sync?
[16597.19s -> 16598.80s]  Hold on.
[16598.80s -> 16600.48s]  Let me get the first screenshot.
[16600.48s -> 16612.29s]  I'm going to do this first.
[16612.29s -> 16613.41s]  Like it's going to be so much easier
[16613.41s -> 16614.61s]  if I get my other monitor back.
[16624.31s -> 16626.15s]  Oh my God, you piece of shit.
[16626.87s -> 16632.71s]  I don't ever buy a monitor
[16632.71s -> 16634.47s]  that has a fucking touch pad on the right.
[16635.03s -> 16636.31s]  It's a piece of crap.
[16637.27s -> 16639.59s]  Like it's a piece of total crap.
[16639.59s -> 16644.61s]  All right, this is a...
[16651.38s -> 16655.24s]  I don't even look like a real person.
[16655.24s -> 16674.52s]  All right, hold on.
[16674.52s -> 16675.16s]  Save that.
[16675.72s -> 16688.40s]  Oh my God.
[16688.40s -> 16697.67s]  I hate computers more than anything.
[16697.67s -> 16698.31s]  Save that.
[16708.71s -> 16710.39s]  I bet you I could probably get it pretty close
[16710.39s -> 16718.00s]  and then this side too.
[16718.00s -> 16752.93s]  I need to bring this over here.
[16752.93s -> 16763.88s]  Okay, I got it.
[16763.88s -> 16764.68s]  Wait, what?
[16764.68s -> 16772.61s]  Why is it a different image?
[16772.61s -> 16774.61s]  It's taking a screenshot of every,
[16774.61s -> 16777.01s]  of all three of my monitors.
[16777.01s -> 16789.81s]  Oh my, hurry the fuck up.
[16793.19s -> 16794.07s]  What are you doing?
[16794.63s -> 16798.23s]  I hate computers.
[16798.23s -> 16799.83s]  I can't wait till we go back to fucking newspapers.
[16799.83s -> 16804.48s]  I swear to God.
[16804.48s -> 16806.08s]  All right, I'm gone.
[16806.08s -> 16810.56s]  I'll be back.
[16810.56s -> 16811.84s]  I got to add the zits too.
[16811.84s -> 16812.88s]  There's like two zits.
[16812.88s -> 16835.22s]  All right, let's get them on screen.
[16835.22s -> 16836.90s]  When it looks like lit up better.
[16836.90s -> 16851.24s]  Okay, so that's what I'm going for.
[16851.24s -> 16855.65s]  I need these references like on my screen.
[16855.65s -> 16867.09s]  I'm going to put it down here.
[16867.09s -> 16868.05s]  That's for you.
[16868.05s -> 16876.90s]  It's your super face cam.
[16889.96s -> 16891.00s]  Make them kiss.
[16893.51s -> 16895.19s]  So now I also...
[16895.75s -> 16900.93s]  Bear with me here.
[16900.93s -> 16902.77s]  Those are three different people.
[16906.32s -> 16906.96s]  They are not.
[16906.96s -> 16917.06s]  I can assure you.
[16917.06s -> 16918.18s]  Now I get them over here.
[16918.18s -> 16922.37s]  All right, here we go.
[16922.37s -> 16924.29s]  Let's see how close I can get this.
[16924.29s -> 16929.88s]  I'll spend four hours on this.
[16929.88s -> 16931.00s]  I could care less.
[16931.00s -> 16937.86s]  All right, time to begin.
[16937.86s -> 16939.88s]  So we're going to start with...
[16941.16s -> 16942.68s]  We're going to go with the front.
[16942.68s -> 16962.21s]  Okay, so we have to go with the circle.
[16962.93s -> 16963.97s]  Or maybe like the cone.
[16964.61s -> 16970.36s]  It's probably cone.
[16970.36s -> 16995.96s]  No, no.
[17003.80s -> 17005.64s]  So let's start with the forehead.
[17005.64s -> 17014.85s]  And then it comes down here.
[17015.65s -> 17016.77s]  I just need like a base.
[17041.19s -> 17043.96s]  I don't think I can fucking do this.
[17043.96s -> 17045.56s]  I need like a base first.
[17051.62s -> 17052.34s]  To do this correctly,
[17052.34s -> 17054.42s]  it's going to take like 50 hours.
[17054.42s -> 17062.16s]  This is like an actual art project.
[17062.16s -> 17073.67s]  There you go, done.
[17075.76s -> 17076.71s]  Who is that?
[17076.71s -> 17077.19s]  No, no.
[17077.19s -> 17078.47s]  What character is this?
[17078.47s -> 17080.68s]  It's a cookie character or something.
[17080.68s -> 17081.72s]  What's the character?
[17081.72s -> 17083.00s]  There's his mouth right there.
[17083.00s -> 17083.72s]  This is eyes.
[17083.72s -> 17086.07s]  Who is this?
[17086.07s -> 17086.63s]  Oh my God.
[17086.63s -> 17105.73s]  It's like a fucking serial character.
[17105.73s -> 17107.81s]  This and then let's shave off.
[17107.81s -> 17113.32s]  Let's get in there.
[17113.32s -> 17120.07s]  What are you doing?
[17124.61s -> 17125.49s]  That was weird.
[17125.49s -> 17128.58s]  Why does it look so weird here?
[17128.58s -> 17134.18s]  All right, let me see what we got.
[17134.74s -> 17144.66s]  Does this part stays up a little?
[17145.46s -> 17159.67s]  Is that the mouth?
[17159.67s -> 17159.99s]  No, no, no.
[17159.99s -> 17161.11s]  This is like the side of the head.
[17164.98s -> 17166.26s]  This is not the nose.
[17166.90s -> 17175.09s]  I just need to get like the general shape.
[17175.09s -> 17189.41s]  Once I just get...
[17189.41s -> 17191.01s]  Let me just like get off the edges here.
[17191.65s -> 17196.61s]  I think I may have made it too big.
[17196.61s -> 17199.83s]  All these controls are killing me.
[17203.35s -> 17233.22s]  This comes in like this.
[17234.50s -> 17249.84s]  Circle's not going to work.
[17252.88s -> 17253.68s]  It's all right.
[17253.68s -> 17255.11s]  I'm doing it.
[17255.11s -> 17255.99s]  I've already started.
[17255.99s -> 17256.23s]  I don't know.
[17256.23s -> 17257.19s]  It's not going back now.
[17263.20s -> 17264.00s]  Maybe the side.
[17264.00s -> 17264.56s]  Oh my God.
[17264.56s -> 17266.56s]  This is going to take forever.
[17266.56s -> 17285.16s]  This is going to actually take forever.
[17285.16s -> 17286.04s]  I know I can do this.
[17286.04s -> 17286.92s]  Where's mirror?
[17286.92s -> 17289.27s]  Okay, there it is.
[17289.27s -> 17293.24s]  I believe I can do it on both sides.
[17293.24s -> 17293.80s]  There we go.
[17293.80s -> 17297.68s]  Okay, zoom out.
[17297.68s -> 17315.28s]  It's getting there.
[17315.28s -> 17333.30s]  I wish I could just see it all.
[17333.30s -> 17336.76s]  I don't want to like have an axis of it.
[17336.76s -> 17338.92s]  I want to like see it the whole thing
[17338.92s -> 17339.64s]  and be able to do it
[17339.64s -> 17341.72s]  and not have to move the fucking camera around.
[17343.60s -> 17348.21s]  I want to stay here.
[17348.21s -> 17350.34s]  I don't want to move in.
[17350.98s -> 17355.48s]  That's like the biggest gripe I have with the game.
[17356.04s -> 17361.11s]  I would love to just lock the camera here
[17361.11s -> 17362.07s]  and like be able to move around
[17362.07s -> 17363.43s]  and sculpt from here.
[17363.43s -> 17364.55s]  No, I have to move forward.
[17373.70s -> 17375.14s]  I can't like lock the camera.
[17382.82s -> 17383.46s]  I don't think there was anything
[17383.46s -> 17384.50s]  in the tutorials talking about
[17384.50s -> 17386.02s]  to lock the camera in place.
[17386.82s -> 17391.83s]  Well, let's just keep going like this.
[17392.71s -> 17397.80s]  Just do it in Blender.
[17397.80s -> 17398.36s]  It's free.
[17400.04s -> 17403.00s]  It probably would be easier to do this in Blender.
[17407.40s -> 17409.40s]  Look, I know I can hold R1
[17409.40s -> 17411.16s]  and rotate all over the place,
[17411.16s -> 17412.60s]  but I can't paint like this.
[17413.24s -> 17414.04s]  I can't do anything.
[17418.39s -> 17419.83s]  I have to move forward.
[17420.96s -> 17425.16s]  It's just really odd.
[17425.16s -> 17427.00s]  The fact that the camera moves with you
[17427.00s -> 17429.96s]  while you move to sculpt
[17429.96s -> 17431.72s]  is just very, very odd
[17431.72s -> 17432.60s]  that they would do that.
[17433.24s -> 17435.36s]  But it doesn't move backwards.
[17435.84s -> 17444.71s]  All right, we're getting there.
[17444.71s -> 17445.83s]  These are correct.
[17445.83s -> 17478.12s]  I just want to lock the camera.
[17478.68s -> 17479.48s]  That's all I want to do.
[17480.12s -> 17497.43s]  Okay, I must get the initial shape.
[17512.31s -> 17513.75s]  This has got to go back here though.
[17514.39s -> 17527.81s]  I'm just turning it into a bike helmet.
[17527.81s -> 17546.96s]  Okay, so let me go up.
[17546.96s -> 17548.08s]  No, no, not up.
[17548.08s -> 17549.59s]  I need to keep these here.
[17549.59s -> 17556.47s]  This has to be changed though.
[17557.43s -> 17564.61s]  Let's go square back here.
[17564.61s -> 17578.12s]  Just remember, don't do it wrong.
[17579.32s -> 17580.36s]  What do you mean don't do it wrong?
[17590.47s -> 17593.88s]  This is immensely difficult to control.
[17597.94s -> 17599.14s]  Dude, you know what?
[17599.14s -> 17601.75s]  Does it really have to be motion controlled?
[17603.68s -> 17604.56s]  I heard somebody said
[17604.56s -> 17606.48s]  that they were making a non-motion
[17606.48s -> 17608.00s]  controlled part of the game.
[17608.00s -> 17611.11s]  Like, can I just turn this off?
[17611.11s -> 17612.23s]  I don't want this.
[17612.23s -> 17627.06s]  I don't want this.
[17627.94s -> 17630.13s]  They're adding control methods.
[17630.13s -> 17630.69s]  Thank God.
[17633.91s -> 17635.51s]  A sculpting general grievous.
[17635.51s -> 17637.11s]  It's just hard to get anything.
[17637.11s -> 17667.48s]  I'm just, ah, it's,
[17667.48s -> 17670.04s]  I'm almost ready to start doing details.
[17670.04s -> 17692.56s]  Look at the side of my face.
[17692.56s -> 17694.48s]  How am I ever going to fix this?
[17696.58s -> 17701.46s]  I'm going to look like a fucking imbecile.
[17701.46s -> 17704.82s]  I'm going to look like a, like an alien race.
[17733.84s -> 17735.20s]  That's close enough.
[17742.92s -> 17746.10s]  Let's see what's in front.
[17746.10s -> 17747.86s]  All I care about is the front and the sides.
[17751.78s -> 17754.00s]  Take this in.
[17762.10s -> 17764.10s]  No, I don't have, this is like turkey neck.
[17774.76s -> 17776.37s]  Okay.
[17776.37s -> 17777.59s]  All right.
[17777.59s -> 17779.51s]  I'm ready to start doing,
[17779.51s -> 17780.87s]  get rid of the mirror.
[17780.87s -> 17788.40s]  What does my face look like?
[17788.40s -> 17788.80s]  Let's see.
[17789.44s -> 17791.92s]  I'm going to start bottom to top.
[17791.92s -> 17797.78s]  Let's see.
[17797.78s -> 17798.90s]  I need the cylinder.
[17799.54s -> 17801.52s]  I have it on.
[17802.08s -> 17803.03s]  Okay.
[17803.03s -> 17803.91s]  Here we go.
[17803.91s -> 17813.46s]  I need to do surface mode and blending, right?
[17813.46s -> 17817.56s]  Oh, it's no, no, no, no.
[17817.56s -> 17818.12s]  Not blending.
[17822.39s -> 17824.39s]  So this, my nose, where's my mouth?
[17825.11s -> 17835.00s]  It starts like this.
[17835.88s -> 17886.10s]  I need to go.
[17887.06s -> 17887.30s]  All right.
[17887.30s -> 17889.38s]  So then what's supposed to measure it from here?
[17890.34s -> 17891.54s]  It's like up here.
[17891.54s -> 17893.14s]  And this is where the nose starts.
[17896.16s -> 17897.92s]  Right there, like right here, actually.
[17912.68s -> 17917.20s]  And then it's still a little bit like a bulb this way.
[17920.24s -> 17933.36s]  It's a little thicker up here.
[17944.02s -> 17946.98s]  It's like two people playing volleyball.
[17987.72s -> 17989.64s]  I need to get it right from this side.
[17990.44s -> 17993.86s]  This is a fucked up.
[17993.86s -> 17995.30s]  This is not even close.
[17995.62s -> 18002.42s]  Looks like somebody took their hand and smashed it into my face.
[18002.42s -> 18005.14s]  They just bombed me straight in, squished.
[18015.22s -> 18016.26s]  Oh, man.
[18016.26s -> 18017.30s]  No fucking way.
[18026.45s -> 18027.65s]  It gets wider here.
[18028.45s -> 18033.35s]  Look at this.
[18033.91s -> 18039.96s]  Okay.
[18039.96s -> 18040.92s]  Let me look over here.
[18041.72s -> 18044.71s]  It's kind of flat right here.
[18056.31s -> 18058.71s]  No, this is like just growths all over my nose.
[18072.15s -> 18075.60s]  Okay.
[18077.91s -> 18078.31s]  Eyes.
[18079.03s -> 18079.59s]  But hold on.
[18079.59s -> 18080.87s]  I have some like dips here.
[18081.75s -> 18082.87s]  No, that's not going to happen.
[18083.43s -> 18090.15s]  So let me see what the eyes look like.
[18090.79s -> 18095.36s]  Go.
[18095.36s -> 18098.12s]  How close are they?
[18098.12s -> 18099.40s]  This one's kind of close to my nose.
[18100.04s -> 18108.56s]  This one's a little further away like this.
[18109.84s -> 18125.80s]  Okay.
[18125.80s -> 18139.51s]  And then I have like kind of a big brow bone that sticks out.
[18142.61s -> 18142.93s]  This.
[18143.65s -> 18181.64s]  I'll get this end here.
[18182.60s -> 18186.28s]  And it kind of comes down like this, but they don't connect.
[18187.16s -> 18193.88s]  And then the forehead.
[18193.88s -> 18195.24s]  My forehead's a little longer than this.
[18195.88s -> 18198.32s]  I can't add to it though.
[18198.88s -> 18215.67s]  Let me check over here.
[18215.67s -> 18216.79s]  I want it to go like this.
[18217.91s -> 18225.65s]  Back this up.
[18226.21s -> 18228.16s]  Let's take all this out.
[18228.16s -> 18228.96s]  It doesn't need to be here.
[18229.76s -> 18243.94s]  Oh, God.
[18244.98s -> 18246.95s]  Don't cut the whole thing off.
[18247.59s -> 18249.96s]  All right.
[18249.96s -> 18251.72s]  I have to add the hair, so don't worry.
[18261.27s -> 18263.11s]  I'm just like a moon face.
[18269.89s -> 18270.77s]  Oh, well.
[18270.77s -> 18294.40s]  All right.
[18294.40s -> 18294.96s]  Getting better.
[18297.76s -> 18298.56s]  My internet design?
[18299.20s -> 18302.02s]  My internet's going fucking crazy, huh?
[18309.46s -> 18310.10s]  New emote?
[18310.10s -> 18310.58s]  Not yet.
[18312.07s -> 18313.99s]  Am I going to stream here or what's going on?
[18313.99s -> 18315.75s]  Dropped like 15,000 frames.
[18315.75s -> 18323.28s]  What the fuck is going on?
[18332.12s -> 18333.16s]  Shave this part off.
[18349.52s -> 18352.08s]  I can cover this with hair, so I'm not concerned about that.
[18353.51s -> 18355.03s]  Question is, is this correct?
[18358.00s -> 18358.56s]  Not really.
[18361.25s -> 18361.49s]  No.
[18362.29s -> 18368.63s]  Give a goddamn camera.
[18369.35s -> 18387.24s]  Let me go in here.
[18387.24s -> 18394.72s]  The mouth is wrong to try to fix this.
[18395.28s -> 18410.77s]  I have a big bottom lip.
[18423.24s -> 18440.04s]  Somebody put some indents on my face.
[18440.60s -> 18442.28s]  Let me just patch those up real quick.
[18443.64s -> 18458.77s]  The nose is way too far away from my mouth, and the eyes are not correct.
[18458.77s -> 18461.64s]  But I think we can move on.
[18466.88s -> 18467.84s]  The nostrils are there.
[18468.48s -> 18471.65s]  I need to go back here.
[18472.45s -> 18477.32s]  All right.
[18477.32s -> 18478.52s]  I need to do paint.
[18479.56s -> 18480.88s]  Go to tint.
[18481.92s -> 18484.48s]  That is kind of my skin right now.
[18485.04s -> 18487.08s]  I don't think I need to change that.
[18499.96s -> 18500.84s]  Just spray paint?
[18500.84s -> 18501.24s]  No, no, no.
[18501.24s -> 18501.72s]  It's got to be...
[18504.64s -> 18509.30s]  Well, let's go to the paint tool.
[18510.26s -> 18515.40s]  Let's grab this one.
[18516.28s -> 18517.08s]  How does that look?
[18517.08s -> 18517.40s]  No.
[18517.40s -> 18518.68s]  These would be like the veiny one.
[18523.94s -> 18525.14s]  Even worse than that.
[18525.94s -> 18526.58s]  Worse than that.
[18527.22s -> 18532.79s]  What's my beard look like?
[18532.79s -> 18534.15s]  It's really stringy and terrible.
[18535.11s -> 18542.16s]  No, not like that.
[18542.16s -> 18545.27s]  I'll probably just go with veins.
[18545.27s -> 18548.47s]  And then the color is dark brown.
[18549.11s -> 18558.28s]  Okay, and snap that.
[18560.88s -> 18564.36s]  Oh my god.
[18572.18s -> 18572.50s]  Okay.
[18613.38s -> 18615.46s]  It's like that.
[18615.46s -> 18616.26s]  No, it's not.
[18619.73s -> 18621.81s]  This is not like glued on a hair.
[18641.43s -> 18642.95s]  Wait, what happened here?
[18642.95s -> 18660.18s]  Oh, should I need to side?
[18660.18s -> 18660.74s]  No, no, no.
[18660.74s -> 18674.24s]  Not yet, not yet.
[18674.24s -> 18675.68s]  This does look like my beard.
[18675.68s -> 18679.65s]  It looks terrible.
[18679.65s -> 18680.45s]  Okay.
[18680.45s -> 18687.97s]  And you didn't think that looked like my beard?
[18687.97s -> 18703.75s]  Come on now.
[18703.75s -> 18705.51s]  Cox is trying to kill the stream.
[18707.84s -> 18709.52s]  Yeah, they do that, don't they?
[18710.00s -> 18720.02s]  Let's put the eyes in.
[18720.02s -> 18727.57s]  I can do the hair too.
[18727.57s -> 18727.89s]  Paint.
[18728.93s -> 18730.29s]  Hair, I'm going to say, would be...
[18732.71s -> 18733.67s]  I know how it looks.
[18734.31s -> 18736.28s]  Probably expressive.
[18738.13s -> 18739.49s]  Yeah, it's definitely going to be expressive.
[18740.05s -> 18740.77s]  Same color too.
[18741.33s -> 18762.55s]  Okay, so this swoops down over here.
[18763.11s -> 18769.64s]  It goes around here.
[18787.09s -> 18787.65s]  What's happening?
[18787.65s -> 18792.29s]  What do you mean?
[18792.29s -> 18793.89s]  My hairline is not higher than this?
[18793.89s -> 18795.54s]  What are you talking about?
[18795.54s -> 18797.62s]  It's already awful.
[18797.62s -> 18798.90s]  It's already so bad.
[18812.56s -> 18813.44s]  Friar tuck.
[18815.35s -> 18816.60s]  Hold on.
[18834.39s -> 18836.31s]  You look like a stooge.
[18836.31s -> 18842.53s]  Just let me get it all on there before anybody makes fun of me.
[18845.06s -> 18845.86s]  I'm going to comb it.
[18853.72s -> 18855.32s]  I have to comb it first.
[18855.32s -> 18865.35s]  Which side does it go down?
[18865.35s -> 18865.91s]  Not that one.
[18866.63s -> 18867.11s]  This one.
[18901.38s -> 18938.61s]  I'm going to try to comb this and we'll see what happens.
[18944.64s -> 18947.52s]  German looking low-key cute in this image here.
[18947.52s -> 18947.84s]  Thanks.
[18947.84s -> 18948.56s]  I appreciate that.
[18963.00s -> 18971.64s]  I don't think this is going to work.
[18974.18s -> 18975.14s]  I may have given up.
[18975.22s -> 18979.91s]  I may have given up a little.
[18979.91s -> 18981.03s]  Not completely.
[18981.03s -> 18981.53s]  100%.
[18986.90s -> 18993.49s]  Although blurry, squint your eyes a little.
[18993.49s -> 18994.77s]  I'm going to finish it.
[18994.77s -> 18995.57s]  Don't worry.
[18995.57s -> 18999.46s]  I came this far.
[19000.60s -> 19001.72s]  You think it was not going to finish?
[19014.29s -> 19016.69s]  I'm going to turn into a Final Fantasy character.
[19023.76s -> 19025.52s]  What's with the hair not being over here?
[19026.61s -> 19028.05s]  Oh my god.
[19028.05s -> 19031.46s]  And why does my internet suck?
[19052.16s -> 19054.32s]  Almost done with this part.
[19054.32s -> 19060.08s]  This needs to be fixed over here.
[19060.08s -> 19062.08s]  I just need a little more going this way.
[19064.82s -> 19065.78s]  It's very flat.
[19065.78s -> 19067.14s]  My hair is not that flat.
[19091.91s -> 19093.03s]  It does look like a wig.
[19097.62s -> 19098.02s]  All right.
[19098.02s -> 19098.42s]  I need...
[19101.62s -> 19101.94s]  No.
[19101.94s -> 19102.34s]  Back it up.
[19102.34s -> 19102.74s]  Back it up.
[19102.74s -> 19103.46s]  Back it up.
[19103.46s -> 19111.78s]  Put my eyes in there.
[19112.58s -> 19116.26s]  And then I'll do some more detail.
[19116.98s -> 19120.80s]  And I need the...
[19121.44s -> 19121.60s]  No.
[19121.60s -> 19122.96s]  I need the spray paint tool.
[19127.01s -> 19127.33s]  Paint.
[19128.45s -> 19132.69s]  I'm going to go white and spray paint.
[19156.96s -> 19160.56s]  This no joke looks like a skinny version of my dad's face.
[19167.60s -> 19168.48s]  Does it?
[19168.48s -> 19171.72s]  All right.
[19171.72s -> 19171.96s]  Okay.
[19172.68s -> 19174.66s]  I'm going to do one circle of black.
[19175.46s -> 19182.87s]  Which it's like here.
[19183.75s -> 19190.12s]  No.
[19190.12s -> 19190.76s]  I need blue.
[19191.56s -> 19192.28s]  Blue first.
[19192.84s -> 19195.88s]  What kind of blue is it?
[19196.44s -> 19197.80s]  It's like a slate blue.
[19198.52s -> 19199.78s]  It's like this.
[19204.42s -> 19204.74s]  Thank you.
[19204.74s -> 19205.38s]  I'll take it.
[19205.38s -> 19205.62s]  Yes.
[19208.26s -> 19208.50s]  Yes.
[19208.50s -> 19209.86s]  I'd love to paint with this, please.
[19210.42s -> 19239.11s]  It doesn't help.
[19243.25s -> 19248.95s]  Don't worry.
[19248.95s -> 19251.51s]  We're going to do terrifying nightmare face Jeremy.
[19272.53s -> 19272.77s]  Red.
[19273.41s -> 19273.73s]  All right.
[19273.73s -> 19274.77s]  What kind of red?
[19274.77s -> 19278.93s]  It's not that red.
[19286.15s -> 19287.51s]  It's not that red either.
[19294.60s -> 19297.08s]  This is very, very, very bad.
[19297.08s -> 19298.42s]  It's okay.
[19298.42s -> 19299.30s]  It's like this.
[19302.16s -> 19302.64s]  There we go.
[19302.64s -> 19303.60s]  That's better.
[19303.60s -> 19326.00s]  This just needs to be sculpted by somebody that knows what they're doing.
[19326.00s -> 19326.32s]  Not me.
[19327.12s -> 19335.57s]  All right.
[19337.41s -> 19339.09s]  I don't know why this hair looks so strange.
[19358.40s -> 19358.80s]  No, no, no.
[19358.80s -> 19359.44s]  I don't want to paint.
[19360.32s -> 19371.67s]  This doesn't look right.
[19371.67s -> 19372.95s]  It just doesn't look right.
[19376.80s -> 19377.04s]  No.
[19378.88s -> 19383.51s]  Somehow that looks better.
[19383.51s -> 19384.47s]  No, I forgot the eyebrows.
[19384.47s -> 19384.79s]  You're right.
[19384.79s -> 19385.51s]  But this needs to be...
[19386.07s -> 19410.88s]  I just look like Tom Green.
[19410.88s -> 19419.36s]  Maybe it's...
[19419.36s -> 19420.08s]  Maybe let me paint the...
[19420.08s -> 19429.12s]  Let me get the eyebrows painted on.
[19429.12s -> 19432.69s]  And then what else to do about this?
[19432.69s -> 19443.70s]  Let's try eyebrows and see if that helps.
[19473.56s -> 19474.52s]  Kind of helps a little.
[19482.88s -> 19485.04s]  My face is too rounded over here.
[19485.04s -> 19499.67s]  See?
[19499.67s -> 19500.47s]  That could be me.
[19500.47s -> 19510.84s]  I definitely...
[19510.84s -> 19511.48s]  I'm going to do...
[19511.48s -> 19512.12s]  Yeah.
[19512.12s -> 19513.96s]  The hair is too fucking stupid looking.
[19515.08s -> 19530.88s]  Okay.
[19530.88s -> 19532.88s]  The hair is wrong a little by a little bit.
[19532.88s -> 19540.31s]  Let me try to fix that.
[19540.95s -> 19542.77s]  All right.
[19542.77s -> 19543.09s]  So here.
[19543.09s -> 19548.76s]  Get your screenshot now because I'm going to try to fix it.
[19549.32s -> 19555.57s]  Okay.
[19585.43s -> 19586.95s]  Makes you a little stranger.
[19587.67s -> 19589.86s]  What if I doesn't kill you?
[19590.50s -> 19601.09s]  I went a little too far.
[19642.60s -> 19643.56s]  Nightmarish.
[19643.56s -> 19644.60s]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[19645.32s -> 19661.38s]  Which color is it?
[19661.38s -> 19662.26s]  This one?
[19662.26s -> 19662.95s]  No.
[19662.95s -> 19664.63s]  What's like the regular just standard?
[19665.59s -> 19666.55s]  Just default one.
[19667.35s -> 19683.83s]  How do I just get default color?
[19684.87s -> 19691.97s]  Oh, whatever.
[19694.79s -> 19695.59s]  Save this one.
[19696.39s -> 19703.78s]  There is a color...
[19703.78s -> 19704.90s]  This is like the color picker.
[19704.90s -> 19707.06s]  But I don't understand how this works.
[19707.86s -> 19709.30s]  Like pure and then mixed.
[19709.30s -> 19709.54s]  I...
[19710.58s -> 19713.14s]  I don't understand how this is...
[19713.14s -> 19714.66s]  Custom picker, right?
[19716.20s -> 19718.04s]  And then pick a shade.
[19718.12s -> 19718.36s]  Okay.
[19719.16s -> 19720.04s]  But it's not doing it.
[19720.04s -> 19721.48s]  And then it's like, whoa, this is...
[19721.48s -> 19722.28s]  Save color.
[19722.28s -> 19724.36s]  Well, then it's confusing.
[19724.92s -> 19732.39s]  It's like the eye drop tool in a way, I guess.
[19733.11s -> 19758.82s]  No, that's not going to work.
[19759.70s -> 19763.78s]  Must be bigger.
[19763.78s -> 19771.30s]  Come on now.
[19771.94s -> 19775.14s]  Come on.
[19775.78s -> 19777.33s]  What are you waiting for?
[19777.97s -> 19782.32s]  Come on.
[19782.32s -> 19783.84s]  I'm trying to do like a jaw breaker.
[19783.84s -> 19786.24s]  Like I'm chewing on a big bubble gum thing.
[19786.24s -> 19803.48s]  It has to be on the other side too.
[19803.48s -> 19805.70s]  Because I'm like crunching on this side.
[19805.70s -> 19812.98s]  A little too much.
[19812.98s -> 19827.08s]  Do you have to be like this game?
[19828.84s -> 19829.72s]  Do you have to be like this?
[19829.72s -> 19830.44s]  What's going on?
[19831.24s -> 19832.37s]  What's the problem?
[19834.18s -> 19834.98s]  There's no problem.
[19834.98s -> 19835.70s]  Stop snapping.
[19836.26s -> 19837.14s]  Don't be like this.
[19837.70s -> 19854.96s]  I need like a wincing face too.
[19855.60s -> 19859.01s]  No, I should be blowing like a bubble.
[19859.57s -> 19876.08s]  Oops.
[19877.12s -> 19877.92s]  Not that deep.
[19877.92s -> 19900.20s]  Pull it forward a little.
[19924.98s -> 19925.38s]  Jesus.
[19927.44s -> 19941.11s]  Pretty good.
[19941.67s -> 19952.60s]  I'm going to turn the nose a little bit.
[19952.60s -> 19953.56s]  Like if I was...
[19954.36s -> 19957.89s]  It should be pulled up a little on this side.
[19979.43s -> 19980.79s]  You have to animate this?
[19980.79s -> 19981.59s]  The eye doesn't...
[19981.59s -> 19982.87s]  I don't even know how to do that.
[19983.03s -> 19992.44s]  Turn this down.
[19994.64s -> 19996.32s]  These eyes have to close a little.
[19997.04s -> 19998.95s]  This.
[19999.59s -> 20021.36s]  It just looks like somebody beat him up.
[20021.36s -> 20022.96s]  These brows need to change a little.
[20023.52s -> 20024.79s]  Oops.
[20025.59s -> 20039.97s]  Like that.
[20046.29s -> 20046.69s]  All right.
[20053.64s -> 20056.28s]  The nose needs to connect to the eyebrows.
[20056.28s -> 20057.24s]  Does it though?
[20057.24s -> 20063.81s]  No, he's eating the big candy.
[20063.81s -> 20067.25s]  All right.
[20067.25s -> 20068.53s]  Now I'm going to make my body.
[20068.53s -> 20073.32s]  What do I have on?
[20073.32s -> 20074.04s]  Blue shirt.
[20074.04s -> 20077.70s]  Bookers all over the nose.
[20113.48s -> 20113.72s]  Okay.
[20142.56s -> 20142.96s]  Not bad.
[20149.64s -> 20150.20s]  No, that's...
[20150.20s -> 20151.32s]  I'm an earthworm.
[20151.32s -> 20168.69s]  A little lower.
[20168.69s -> 20177.27s]  That looks all right.
[20189.19s -> 20189.59s]  Okay.
[20190.63s -> 20195.99s]  And let's do some more work over here.
[20240.20s -> 20241.08s]  Don't give it arms.
[20241.08s -> 20241.96s]  Why not?
[20241.96s -> 20254.28s]  Okay.
[20254.28s -> 20257.97s]  Let's group these together.
[20258.77s -> 20262.18s]  They already grouped?
[20270.15s -> 20271.19s]  Are they grouped already?
[20271.19s -> 20271.59s]  I got it.
[20271.59s -> 20271.91s]  They are.
[20271.91s -> 20272.23s]  Okay.
[20307.06s -> 20311.46s]  I need to do it a little differently though.
[20339.54s -> 20341.22s]  Why is everybody so horrified?
[20341.22s -> 20343.22s]  I can't make a fucking monster?
[20343.22s -> 20355.97s]  Turn the snap back on.
[20355.97s -> 20357.09s]  Yeah, that's actually a good idea.
[20357.81s -> 20364.72s]  Let's get down in here.
[20364.72s -> 20372.00s]  And now I'm not even going to just copy.
[20373.36s -> 20379.12s]  God.
[20379.20s -> 20380.92s]  I hate that so much.
[20415.96s -> 20416.36s]  Oops.
[20418.87s -> 20419.51s]  Stand back.
[20419.51s -> 20426.47s]  I'm going to vomit.
[20426.47s -> 20426.95s]  All right.
[20426.95s -> 20427.19s]  Fine.
[20427.91s -> 20429.35s]  I'll conclude it here.
[20429.35s -> 20432.77s]  But not yet.
[20432.77s -> 20475.92s]  I have to put a blue shirt on them.
[20475.92s -> 20482.18s]  And I have to put them on like a stone pedestal.
[20482.18s -> 20483.14s]  Oh, fuck.
[20483.14s -> 20487.04s]  I never grouped these together.
[20487.04s -> 20493.17s]  Oopsie daisy.
[20493.17s -> 20509.06s]  Looks all right.
[20512.13s -> 20514.77s]  Oh, didn't group those together either.
[20514.77s -> 20523.38s]  Going so slow.
[20523.38s -> 20532.85s]  No, deselect.
[20532.85s -> 20545.04s]  Am I selecting the beard too?
[20545.04s -> 20545.60s]  I hope so.
[20560.21s -> 20560.85s]  Okay.
[20560.85s -> 20565.20s]  One, two, three, four.
[20565.20s -> 20565.60s]  What?
[20565.60s -> 20571.32s]  I thought this game was going to make me puke.
[20575.54s -> 20575.94s]  Okay.
[20576.66s -> 20577.06s]  Grab.
[20578.05s -> 20580.84s]  Two, three.
[20580.84s -> 20581.40s]  Group them.
[20584.20s -> 20601.84s]  What are you doing?
[20603.94s -> 20604.26s]  No.
[20604.26s -> 20605.86s]  Now I have to ungroup this shit.
[20621.38s -> 20622.66s]  Oh, I'm about to fucking exit the game.
[20627.12s -> 20629.36s]  I'm just trying to group these together.
[20631.30s -> 20636.88s]  I did it already.
[20636.88s -> 20638.24s]  Oh my god.
[20638.24s -> 20659.06s]  Okay, that's better.
[20659.70s -> 20666.53s]  I'm not even sure this is attached.
[20673.54s -> 20674.02s]  No, it is.
[20675.68s -> 20676.08s]  All right.
[20676.08s -> 20677.76s]  Now for the final finishing touches,
[20677.76s -> 20679.76s]  I need to put a little t-shirt on them
[20679.76s -> 20685.22s]  and then turn this into stone.
[20685.22s -> 20686.26s]  Mad because bad.
[20686.26s -> 20687.06s]  Mad because bad.
[20688.34s -> 20690.74s]  It takes a lot of fucking work to figure this shit out.
[20696.08s -> 20698.32s]  Even still, I still don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
[20698.32s -> 20700.00s]  Now let's do this.
[20700.56s -> 20708.42s]  And then I want to make this stone.
[20709.06s -> 20710.26s]  I'm going to make them shiny.
[20710.90s -> 20722.23s]  Let's go with a shiny.
[20722.79s -> 20723.67s]  See what this looks like.
[20732.31s -> 20732.63s]  Perfect.
[20732.63s -> 20733.35s]  Nice and sweaty.
[20733.91s -> 20749.83s]  Oh, it looks like it's made of the glass.
[20750.63s -> 20759.96s]  Okay, now the color is fine.
[20760.52s -> 20762.52s]  Although I do need to change the color of this
[20762.52s -> 20763.72s]  because I just want this to be stone.
[20764.76s -> 20768.02s]  Yeah, just like a little place to show off.
[20768.58s -> 20770.10s]  Maybe a little bit darker.
[20770.82s -> 20771.86s]  I think that's better.
[20772.42s -> 20776.44s]  I'm going to make glowing red eyes.
[20777.40s -> 20785.78s]  I don't even know if I can do that.
[20786.42s -> 20802.96s]  Oh, I can definitely do that.
[20804.55s -> 20805.67s]  Glowing red, you got it.
[20806.39s -> 20809.38s]  I still have to put a t-shirt on them.
[20809.38s -> 20822.28s]  Okay, let's make these glow red.
[20823.08s -> 20833.83s]  I want these things to move around too.
[20839.76s -> 20840.32s]  They moving?
[20840.88s -> 20861.19s]  I don't think so.
[20862.56s -> 20864.80s]  He's wet, but I'm going to put rain in.
[20864.80s -> 20865.76s]  Thanks for telling me.
[20865.76s -> 20887.48s]  Let me glow.
[20888.28s -> 20889.89s]  Where is it under?
[20889.89s -> 20890.77s]  Is it under style?
[20890.77s -> 20891.33s]  Yeah.
[20891.33s -> 20891.97s]  No, it's not.
[20891.97s -> 20892.37s]  Where is it?
[20893.41s -> 20895.46s]  Glow right here.
[20895.46s -> 20895.86s]  Glow.
[20896.50s -> 20900.48s]  Now I want this to be red.
[20905.28s -> 20912.31s]  This glow, glow.
[20920.80s -> 20921.36s]  It works.
[20921.92s -> 20923.73s]  That's got a lot of glow.
[20923.73s -> 20935.64s]  I don't think it works.
[20936.28s -> 20937.08s]  How about blue?
[20937.08s -> 20938.20s]  Because my eyes are blue.
[20951.70s -> 20955.38s]  Why is it still red?
[20955.38s -> 20956.10s]  No, whatever.
[20963.11s -> 20965.88s]  All right, rain.
[20970.48s -> 20971.84s]  So we need paint.
[20971.84s -> 20974.21s]  I've got to go over here.
[20974.21s -> 20978.13s]  We've got to do the ruler.
[20978.13s -> 20981.54s]  We're going to put like fucking lightning and shit in the background.
[20981.54s -> 20982.82s]  I have to add a penis.
[20982.82s -> 20983.46s]  No, I don't.
[20983.46s -> 20985.14s]  I don't have to do that actually.
[20985.14s -> 20989.62s]  I'm going to do straight line, right?
[20989.62s -> 20992.12s]  Straight, make it blue.
[20992.84s -> 21011.52s]  Okay, now I should be able to...
[21016.00s -> 21017.12s]  Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing?
[21017.12s -> 21024.18s]  Hey, hey, hey, where's the other one?
[21024.18s -> 21025.70s]  Oh, just like blend in.
[21025.70s -> 21033.56s]  And now I should be able to open up this menu.
[21034.36s -> 21039.09s]  And we're going to go to animation, playback settings.
[21039.81s -> 21040.98s]  There we go.
[21041.70s -> 21043.27s]  Trail length.
[21043.83s -> 21049.09s]  Okay.
[21049.09s -> 21053.11s]  That's taking a long time to fall.
[21060.98s -> 21063.06s]  Not the best rain I've ever made.
[21072.58s -> 21073.54s]  Zoom it out.
[21073.54s -> 21078.34s]  I think I made them too big.
[21078.34s -> 21116.04s]  Animate in sequence, pulse, spread.
[21116.04s -> 21116.52s]  There we go.
[21118.96s -> 21119.60s]  Jitter.
[21119.60s -> 21120.16s]  There we go.
[21120.80s -> 21126.08s]  It needs to be better looking though.
[21126.08s -> 21127.52s]  Looks weird.
[21127.52s -> 21134.07s]  Get this out of the way.
[21134.07s -> 21154.53s]  I wonder how...
[21155.49s -> 21161.09s]  I need this to go faster.
[21166.56s -> 21167.36s]  There we go.
[21167.36s -> 21167.68s]  Okay.
[21168.24s -> 21174.15s]  Not really.
[21174.15s -> 21179.91s]  I thought I had it.
[21179.91s -> 21200.76s]  Because these need to be spread out a little bit more.
[21201.96s -> 21206.90s]  The effects.
[21206.90s -> 21207.30s]  Boil.
[21208.71s -> 21209.03s]  No.
[21210.60s -> 21211.56s]  Evaporate.
[21211.56s -> 21212.60s]  Ooh, okay.
[21212.60s -> 21213.64s]  There we are.
[21213.64s -> 21215.27s]  That's how we get droplets.
[21219.78s -> 21221.46s]  And throb maybe?
[21221.46s -> 21226.18s]  They're just in weird places.
[21237.12s -> 21238.24s]  Maximum throb.
[21238.88s -> 21243.25s]  Let me go down here and like look up.
[21247.36s -> 21247.60s]  Yeah.
[21248.40s -> 21249.12s]  I'm close.
[21249.86s -> 21251.38s]  I'm really close.
[21251.38s -> 21252.90s]  It's just not quite there.
[21255.00s -> 21255.88s]  Almost there.
[21255.88s -> 21257.08s]  But not quite.
[21257.08s -> 21280.44s]  How are you talking without moving your mouth?
[21280.44s -> 21285.14s]  That's like ice.
[21285.14s -> 21288.45s]  Maybe you just shrink it.
[21288.45s -> 21294.08s]  Drop the opacity too.
[21294.08s -> 21294.80s]  Hey, look at that.
[21294.80s -> 21295.68s]  It looks a little better.
[21296.32s -> 21306.60s]  Turn it down.
[21306.60s -> 21307.08s]  Turn it down.
[21307.08s -> 21307.56s]  Turn it down.
[21307.56s -> 21308.04s]  Turn it down.
[21308.04s -> 21308.60s]  Turn it down.
[21308.60s -> 21309.24s]  Turn it down.
[21309.88s -> 21310.60s]  Oh God.
[21311.16s -> 21321.81s]  I can't turn it down.
[21321.81s -> 21322.05s]  All right.
[21322.05s -> 21323.09s]  That's good enough.
[21323.09s -> 21326.15s]  Now we just need some scary sounds.
[21326.15s -> 21336.87s]  It's almost like a windstorm.
[21336.87s -> 21337.27s]  Ooh.
[21337.83s -> 21349.38s]  I actually like that.
[21357.06s -> 21358.66s]  That really really does look like a windstorm.
[21359.62s -> 21374.88s]  All right.
[21374.88s -> 21375.28s]  You guys.
[21376.77s -> 21377.49s]  You guys remember.
[21379.59s -> 21385.08s]  I'm gonna take these off now.
[21385.08s -> 21386.36s]  Kim just brought up this.
[21391.28s -> 21391.84s]  Look at this.
[21392.48s -> 21395.81s]  I feel like I'm having like dreams again.
[21396.53s -> 21397.73s]  Of this same.
[21397.73s -> 21399.57s]  This is like the same amazing dinner.
[21400.21s -> 21401.73s]  Is it the same day?
[21401.73s -> 21404.55s]  This is fucking awesome.
[21404.55s -> 21406.29s]  She just made it apparently.
[21410.64s -> 21412.16s]  I like it the way it is.
[21412.16s -> 21415.41s]  I like it like that.
[21415.41s -> 21419.28s]  I am going to put on some song here.
[21419.28s -> 21419.84s]  Some music.
[21420.40s -> 21426.24s]  No, I don't want sound gadgets.
[21426.24s -> 21428.40s]  I just want like rain and thunder.
[21428.40s -> 21429.52s]  And scary music.
[21435.97s -> 21440.96s]  Right here.
[21440.96s -> 21441.36s]  All right.
[21441.36s -> 21441.76s]  Rain.
[21449.35s -> 21453.12s]  This means this is the field where you hear it.
[21453.12s -> 21454.96s]  But you'll hear it the whole time anyways.
[21455.52s -> 21458.55s]  Now I need like lightning strikes.
[21464.71s -> 21470.47s]  I like that too.
[21471.11s -> 21476.45s]  All right.
[21476.45s -> 21477.57s]  Now I need scary music.
[21482.23s -> 21482.47s]  Okay.
[21486.96s -> 21487.36s]  So you guys.
[21487.36s -> 21612.69s]  I couldn't go in fast enough.
[21612.69s -> 21613.01s]  Really.
[21614.93s -> 21616.93s]  I was trying to go in really fast to his face.
[21624.05s -> 21624.61s]  All right.
[21624.61s -> 21626.61s]  I think that's going to be it for dreams for now.
[21627.81s -> 21631.11s]  Unless does it does anybody?
[21631.75s -> 21632.79s]  Did anybody make something?
[21633.59s -> 21635.22s]  Did anybody make something?
[21636.64s -> 21649.40s]  I could hear that from my kitchen.
[21650.92s -> 21657.40s]  Let me check again.
[21657.40s -> 21665.72s]  I'm going to save this as a final.
[21665.72s -> 21670.61s]  My creation three.
[21680.50s -> 21683.06s]  Imagine coming across that thumbnail.
[21687.24s -> 21687.48s]  Okay.
[21688.20s -> 21689.16s]  Here's what I made today.
[21692.71s -> 21697.64s]  Those of you that didn't see this before.
[21698.28s -> 21699.30s]  I will show it to you.
[21705.86s -> 21707.14s]  It's the ice cream.
[21707.14s -> 21713.01s]  That's so fucking funny.
[21713.01s -> 21713.89s]  I can't believe that.
[21716.37s -> 21717.41s]  I forgot about that.
[21718.29s -> 21719.41s]  Germapopsicle.
[21720.45s -> 21721.41s]  Or Germapop.
[21722.29s -> 21723.33s]  I don't know what that'll be.
[21728.93s -> 21733.78s]  I love how I just made a better version of this today.
[21733.78s -> 21734.98s]  You don't talk about progress?
[21734.98s -> 21735.22s]  All right.
[21735.22s -> 21735.62s]  Look at this.
[21736.34s -> 21737.62s]  Take a look at that thing.
[21737.62s -> 21741.73s]  Tell me that I didn't make progress today.
[21742.29s -> 21748.36s]  Okay.
[21749.00s -> 21751.08s]  You don't think I made progress today?
[21767.33s -> 21768.85s]  And then what was the other one I did?
[21768.85s -> 21770.77s]  I spent like three and a half hours on that other thing.
[21776.63s -> 21777.83s]  I don't even remember this one.
[21779.12s -> 21779.68s]  Oh God.
[21780.32s -> 21794.36s]  Oh yeah.
[21794.36s -> 21795.00s]  Now I remember.
[21795.80s -> 21800.60s]  I wanted to fix this.
[21809.72s -> 21810.92s]  King of the Monsters.
[21813.78s -> 21817.48s]  Oh, well there you go.
[21821.33s -> 21824.45s]  There are those are my three dreams that I was able to come out of my head
[21825.25s -> 21826.29s]  in the last 12 hours.
[21827.09s -> 21831.04s]  And I'll tell you my final assessment of the game so far.
[21831.04s -> 21832.08s]  Well, finalism.
[21832.08s -> 21837.28s]  I think we dropped a lot of frames too.
[21838.32s -> 21839.60s]  I think this game is really, really good.
[21840.79s -> 21841.59s]  It's really awesome.
[21842.84s -> 21844.68s]  I love the idea.
[21846.68s -> 21850.76s]  I just want, I want some different control schemes.
[21851.64s -> 21857.14s]  Because I would almost much rather the camera be the gyroscope.
[21858.34s -> 21861.22s]  Like I can tilt the camera around and have it set to sensitivity
[21861.22s -> 21863.06s]  and use the sticks to move other stuff around.
[21863.86s -> 21869.14s]  I don't know how true this is,
[21869.14s -> 21871.94s]  but someone who's mentioning that a mouse and keyboard, right?
[21875.46s -> 21876.10s]  Does that work?
[21876.98s -> 21883.40s]  That sounds worse.
[21883.40s -> 21884.12s]  I really just don't know.
[21884.12s -> 21889.16s]  It's hard to make a game like this on console that has this much detail.
[21895.89s -> 21898.12s]  And the journey so far.
[21898.92s -> 21902.52s]  Depending on, I know a lot of people were saying earlier in the stream
[21902.52s -> 21908.52s]  and I kind of lashed back about how this is a boring stream or whatever.
[21908.52s -> 21911.72s]  But this is really the time that I have to do it.
[21912.68s -> 21913.32s]  You know what I'm saying?
[21914.04s -> 21919.97s]  And sure, I can turn the stream off right now and go play it again.
[21921.16s -> 21925.96s]  But, you know, there's other things that I have to do.
[21925.96s -> 21936.44s]  And speaking of other things, just trying one of those tomatoes.
[21937.08s -> 21938.88s]  I gotta get this off the screen.
[21939.84s -> 21942.45s]  Okay, there we go.
[21945.70s -> 21947.38s]  Not every stream has to be like 100 miles per hour.
[21948.10s -> 21948.58s]  Yeah, I know.
[21949.38s -> 21952.26s]  And I'm honestly just trying to learn a new game.
[21953.30s -> 21957.86s]  You can't know everything and know every single thing works
[21958.50s -> 21963.22s]  in the first 10 to 12 hours of a game that's designed to put hundreds.
[21967.14s -> 21971.46s]  But I know that people want to see more high octane kind of stuff on the stream.
[21972.53s -> 21976.84s]  But I don't really have any other option than to stream it.
[21976.84s -> 21978.20s]  Because if I don't stream this game,
[21979.00s -> 21981.96s]  that look, for instance, like tomorrow and Friday, right?
[21981.96s -> 21983.40s]  I'm not playing Dreams.
[21985.70s -> 21993.54s]  I'm not learning more things tomorrow.
[21993.54s -> 21994.34s]  But it's all good.
[21998.36s -> 21999.08s]  Surf some more?
[22001.72s -> 22007.19s]  Yeah, well, we will do this all tomorrow.
[22007.19s -> 22007.75s]  Tomorrow?
[22013.33s -> 22015.01s]  Well, I'm not, no, the stream's not over yet.
[22015.65s -> 22020.05s]  Because I do want to search for to see if anybody made any German related stuff.
[22020.05s -> 22021.01s]  J-U-R-M-A.
[22021.97s -> 22026.95s]  But tomorrow is going to be, the start time is going to be different.
[22027.35s -> 22030.52s]  Let me see.
[22031.24s -> 22036.02s]  Depending on when I get up tomorrow, I might go early, like really early.
[22036.02s -> 22036.74s]  Let me see.
[22037.46s -> 22039.54s]  It's either going to be really early or a little bit later.
[22040.34s -> 22049.09s]  All right.
[22049.09s -> 22051.89s]  We're going to looks like we're going to be an early boy tomorrow.
[22056.39s -> 22058.55s]  And when I say early boy, I mean early.
[22059.19s -> 22065.80s]  This is an EU friendly stream tomorrow.
[22066.44s -> 22077.75s]  I'm probably going to because auto has an appointment at the vet at 5pm Pacific.
[22078.95s -> 22082.71s]  So I'm going to try to start the stream tomorrow somewhere around like 11 or 12.
[22083.27s -> 22084.71s]  Stream for about five or six hours.
[22089.24s -> 22091.80s]  So you're going to get a really early one tomorrow.
[22092.36s -> 22093.32s]  No, he's fine.
[22093.32s -> 22093.96s]  He's fine.
[22093.96s -> 22094.36s]  He's good.
[22095.00s -> 22096.52s]  He just needs to go get a shot.
[22096.52s -> 22100.12s]  He gets a shot every three to four weeks because he has Addison's disease.
[22104.48s -> 22107.20s]  11 or 12 Pacific or Eastern Pacific.
[22107.84s -> 22115.08s]  So somewhere around like three, three ish pm Eastern is when the stream is going
[22115.08s -> 22117.64s]  to start tomorrow.
[22117.64s -> 22118.84s]  He has Addison's disease.
[22119.48s -> 22123.72s]  What am I going to stream?
[22123.72s -> 22124.44s]  That's a good question.
[22125.32s -> 22126.04s]  I really don't know.
[22130.02s -> 22142.80s]  Uh, there's a couple of options, but I really I don't know more dreams.
[22142.80s -> 22150.53s]  Um, maybe maybe maybe maybe make a game next time.
[22150.53s -> 22151.41s]  Like a little platformer.
[22151.41s -> 22151.81s]  I don't know.
[22158.28s -> 22158.92s]  Jet Island.
[22158.92s -> 22160.84s]  I my VR is all packed up right now.
[22165.84s -> 22166.56s]  I don't know.
[22166.56s -> 22167.28s]  I'll figure it out.
[22167.84s -> 22180.29s]  If it's not dreams part two or part three, then it'll be something else with that.
[22180.29s -> 22181.97s]  I am going to switch back to the game.
[22182.85s -> 22185.89s]  And we're going to look to see if anybody has anything.
[22186.69s -> 22192.47s]  Browse all and I believe, um, do I have all this stuff?
[22195.49s -> 22195.97s]  No, no, no, no.
[22195.97s -> 22197.01s]  I want to just get these off.
[22197.65s -> 22199.11s]  Well, should I leave them on?
[22199.91s -> 22201.52s]  Should I leave them on?
[22205.25s -> 22208.37s]  People probably coming in this room just being like, what the fuck is this dude doing?
[22213.12s -> 22213.76s]  Germa.
[22214.72s -> 22215.97s]  Bring it back.
[22215.97s -> 22216.29s]  Oops.
[22220.29s -> 22224.37s]  J E bar may.
[22226.88s -> 22227.92s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[22228.48s -> 22231.38s]  We got a couple.
[22231.94s -> 22238.66s]  Look at that.
[22238.66s -> 22241.08s]  All right.
[22241.08s -> 22242.52s]  This is germa test.
[22242.52s -> 22247.54s]  Let's try this one.
[22247.54s -> 22266.42s]  Uh, just what's what is on my face?
[22267.38s -> 22270.68s]  I'm just in a constant permanent dab.
[22271.32s -> 22273.84s]  That's a pretty nice bog too.
[22273.84s -> 22274.00s]  All right.
[22274.00s -> 22274.24s]  Hold on.
[22274.24s -> 22275.60s]  I want to get like a close look at this.
[22282.63s -> 22283.59s]  Look at that face.
[22287.00s -> 22288.76s]  I'm skipping with one foot.
[22293.44s -> 22295.68s]  My right leg's really bothering me lately.
[22295.68s -> 22298.64s]  That's fucking hilarious.
[22298.64s -> 22298.88s]  All right.
[22298.88s -> 22299.76s]  Let's go back.
[22299.76s -> 22300.74s]  What was that one up?
[22304.58s -> 22307.22s]  And this is germa jup.
[22307.86s -> 22309.49s]  Germa jupiter.
[22309.49s -> 22312.36s]  I think it's just a painting, a little sculpture.
[22312.92s -> 22313.16s]  Yep.
[22316.36s -> 22316.76s]  Okay.
[22317.40s -> 22317.72s]  Yep.
[22319.49s -> 22320.69s]  And it has an ass.
[22320.69s -> 22321.33s]  Of course it does.
[22323.24s -> 22324.60s]  Why wouldn't it have butt cheeks?
[22325.24s -> 22332.47s]  What's the other one?
[22332.47s -> 22333.75s]  We got germa old.
[22334.63s -> 22336.87s]  Germa old and germa old.
[22336.87s -> 22360.82s]  This is a game after streaming for 75 years.
[22363.11s -> 22369.16s]  F tier boomer decides to retire, choosing to leave Vegas for the sticks.
[22371.41s -> 22377.64s]  He can't help to feel something follows from his past.
[22396.76s -> 22418.85s]  This is for real.
[22418.85s -> 22430.53s]  What's in the shed?
[22430.53s -> 22436.37s]  What a nice compact cabin, says me.
[22442.04s -> 22442.52s]  Yeah.
[22442.52s -> 22443.08s]  Is that it?
[22443.64s -> 22457.97s]  What about outside maybe?
[22457.97s -> 22471.67s]  What the fuck?
[22471.67s -> 22482.36s]  Six months later, a noise outside.
[22485.99s -> 22487.19s]  How do you make grass like that?
[22487.19s -> 22488.79s]  Better go check what it was.
[22488.79s -> 22490.07s]  How do you make grass like this?
[22490.63s -> 22494.07s]  How do you make trees like this?
[22494.07s -> 22500.15s]  What's this trail?
[22500.15s -> 22504.08s]  All right.
[22504.08s -> 22505.60s]  How long did it take you to make this?
[22508.12s -> 22509.96s]  How long did it take you to know how to do this?
[22509.96s -> 22527.49s]  Oh wait, there are just assets in the search bar.
[22527.49s -> 22530.05s]  Less time than it took you to make the scorpion ice cream.
[22531.80s -> 22532.76s]  All right, what's over here?
[22532.76s -> 22533.56s]  Is it a bunker?
[22534.28s -> 22538.98s]  What the fuck is going on?
[22567.16s -> 22572.40s]  I think these are the same thing.
[22572.40s -> 22573.36s]  That was fucking awesome.
[22579.03s -> 22580.23s]  For germa!
[22580.23s -> 22581.76s]  What's this one?
[22581.76s -> 22582.48s]  What's this?
[22595.67s -> 22596.95s]  Song made for me?
[22597.59s -> 22610.36s]  I want to see the timeline.
[22640.39s -> 22654.42s]  When I simply remember my favorite things so bad.
[22664.20s -> 22671.00s]  You thought it was going to be a gnome?
[22671.00s -> 22675.03s]  No, that's pretty good.
[22680.10s -> 22681.56s]  What is this one?
[22684.87s -> 22686.23s]  This is a remix of...
[22686.79s -> 22691.65s]  Is this supposed to be me?
[22691.65s -> 22695.30s]  So, okay, I see what you did here.
[22695.30s -> 22698.72s]  You got this asset from somewhere
[22698.72s -> 22701.04s]  and then you put this fucking head on it
[22701.04s -> 22703.84s]  with the Crusty the Clown hair.
[22703.84s -> 22704.80s]  That has to be what it is.
[22714.61s -> 22715.25s]  Remix.
[22717.44s -> 22720.15s]  I love how it just kind of just feeding in here.
[22721.49s -> 22723.09s]  Mystic Manor Preview.
[22728.52s -> 22729.08s]  What is this?
[22736.72s -> 22746.29s]  Mystic Playground.
[22747.09s -> 22772.39s]  Haunted Hedge Maze.
[22773.27s -> 22774.79s]  These are all going to be levels.
[22778.55s -> 22783.41s]  This is pretty great.
[22784.21s -> 22789.33s]  I mean, this is great.
[22789.33s -> 22789.83s]  It is.
[22790.45s -> 22796.50s]  What did mine look like?
[22797.54s -> 22803.51s]  Let me do that.
[22803.51s -> 22804.23s]  That's fucking awesome.
[22806.15s -> 22813.20s]  I think that's it.
[22815.91s -> 22816.63s]  What about mine?
[22819.84s -> 22824.79s]  That's so detailed.
[22830.76s -> 22831.56s]  Is another test.
[22833.89s -> 22834.29s]  All right.
[22834.93s -> 22835.81s]  That was fucking cool.
[22836.53s -> 22838.72s]  Maybe I'll do it again tomorrow.
[22838.72s -> 22839.36s]  Let me see what I made.
[22839.36s -> 22839.84s]  What did I do?
[22841.04s -> 22842.18s]  Let's see mine.
[22842.82s -> 22848.12s]  Pretty sick.
[22848.76s -> 22856.74s]  I have to publish that one.
[22862.24s -> 22863.52s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[22863.52s -> 22864.88s]  I need to like name it something better
[22864.88s -> 22868.24s]  than my creation 8.5 2019.
[22868.24s -> 22881.68s]  How about Worm Worm?
[22886.82s -> 22887.86s]  Sad Worm?
[22890.24s -> 22892.56s]  How about my creation dash Worm?
[22893.60s -> 22894.10s]  Worma.
[22900.61s -> 22901.11s]  Worma?
[22906.96s -> 22907.46s]  Worma.
[22913.75s -> 22914.25s]  Release.
[22915.73s -> 22917.65s]  Save and release this version online as public.
[22917.65s -> 22920.21s]  Discoverable, accessible, and remixable by everyone.
[22920.77s -> 22923.44s]  Version notes tell you you're a collaborator.
[22923.44s -> 22923.84s]  It's not the dream.
[22923.84s -> 22925.04s]  It's anything you want to say about this.
[22979.52s -> 22980.56s]  I want to do like point.
[22981.20s -> 23011.40s]  I want to go.
[23011.40s -> 23011.88s]  Hold on.
[23011.88s -> 23013.40s]  I got to give release notes.
[23013.40s -> 23015.78s]  How do I go down?
[23015.78s -> 23055.48s]  There we go.
[23055.48s -> 23056.68s]  Zero point nine.
[23057.80s -> 23059.08s]  Zero point three.
[23059.08s -> 23059.88s]  Zero point seven.
[23059.88s -> 23060.84s]  Zero point nine.
[23060.84s -> 23062.12s]  He's going backwards.
[23069.22s -> 23070.10s]  No, he's...
[23070.10s -> 23085.43s]  Hold on.
[23085.43s -> 23086.47s]  Made Rain.
[23089.11s -> 23092.20s]  And then 1.0.
[23101.80s -> 23144.82s]  1.0.
[23144.82s -> 23145.78s]  Okay, there we go.
[23145.78s -> 23156.64s]  There are your patch notes.
[23156.64s -> 23157.44s]  Release.
[23157.44s -> 23162.52s]  Release it.
[23162.52s -> 23166.08s]  Here we go.
[23166.08s -> 23166.58s]  Wait.
[23176.76s -> 23179.54s]  Making something public is forever.
[23179.54s -> 23180.66s]  Once you've made something public,
[23180.66s -> 23181.94s]  you won't be able to take it back.
[23181.94s -> 23184.42s]  You will only be able to stop it from appearing in searches
[23184.42s -> 23187.06s]  by unlisting it in the creation setting.
[23187.06s -> 23188.82s]  Do you want to continue?
[23188.82s -> 23206.98s]  I can't thumbs up my own thing.
[23206.98s -> 23209.59s]  Full credits.
[23209.59s -> 23210.23s]  Audio.
[23210.23s -> 23212.15s]  Oh, wait, because the song.
[23217.51s -> 23218.39s]  All right, that's it.
[23218.39s -> 23219.43s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[23221.68s -> 23225.76s]  I'm going to do the bits and the subs and all that stuff.
[23231.51s -> 23233.03s]  I may play this, but remember,
[23233.03s -> 23234.63s]  we're going real early tomorrow.
[23234.63s -> 23240.05s]  Starting somewhere around 11 to 12 Pacific time.
[23240.61s -> 23252.48s]  That's wrong.
[23261.28s -> 23262.24s]  It might be dreams.
[23262.24s -> 23263.20s]  It might not.
[23263.20s -> 23264.88s]  I might jump into something else.
[23264.88s -> 23272.66s]  We're going to go back.
[23272.66s -> 23275.30s]  I missed a lot today because I was just really focused
[23275.94s -> 23278.32s]  trying to make sure I was doing things correctly.
[23280.84s -> 23282.92s]  But six and a half hours ago,
[23282.92s -> 23286.84s]  we had $15 come in from Bill Buttlicher.
[23287.56s -> 23288.87s]  Thank you, Bill.
[23289.59s -> 23292.61s]  Thank you, Mr. Buttlicher.
[23292.61s -> 23293.25s]  I appreciate it.
[23293.81s -> 23298.50s]  Long time YouTube viewer.
[23298.50s -> 23300.50s]  I don't get a chance to watch your streams very much
[23300.50s -> 23302.02s]  because I work all the time.
[23302.02s -> 23303.14s]  But thought I would show some support
[23303.14s -> 23304.18s]  for all the hours of entertainment
[23304.18s -> 23305.14s]  you give me over the years.
[23308.36s -> 23308.76s]  Thank you.
[23309.40s -> 23312.48s]  Um, I was on YouTube for a long time.
[23312.48s -> 23316.16s]  You must have been around for a while.
[23318.84s -> 23321.49s]  But always a pleasure to have anybody pop in
[23321.49s -> 23323.49s]  that's been around for a long time.
[23325.22s -> 23326.34s]  Thanks for the $15.
[23326.34s -> 23330.93s]  And thanks for the literally hundreds of hours
[23330.93s -> 23333.73s]  you've spent hanging out watching content.
[23336.60s -> 23337.40s]  It means the world to me.
[23337.40s -> 23337.72s]  Thank you.
[23338.44s -> 23340.47s]  Snooze and Coffin, thanks for the $2.50.
[23341.27s -> 23342.23s]  Jerma, thanks for the stream.
[23342.23s -> 23343.11s]  I can't watch it all today
[23343.11s -> 23345.03s]  because I work tomorrow at 10 30 a.m.
[23345.59s -> 23347.43s]  And it's 2 a.m. here now.
[23347.91s -> 23348.95s]  I was hoping for a stream like this
[23348.95s -> 23350.31s]  and I was worried you already prepared
[23350.31s -> 23351.27s]  something beforehand.
[23351.83s -> 23353.51s]  I look forward to working on dream stuff.
[23353.51s -> 23355.83s]  Apologize alongside you tomorrow.
[23356.39s -> 23357.91s]  Also, are you using the motion controls?
[23357.91s -> 23359.83s]  Heard they're superior in terms of sculpting.
[23363.41s -> 23365.17s]  I'm not using the motion controllers
[23365.89s -> 23367.33s]  but the most controllers I've heard
[23368.13s -> 23369.33s]  they're good for sculpting
[23369.33s -> 23371.09s]  but they're awful for everything else.
[23379.30s -> 23382.90s]  So I've seen people switch between them.
[23384.76s -> 23386.76s]  Actually switch between them when they sculpt
[23386.76s -> 23388.20s]  they use the move controllers.
[23389.89s -> 23391.17s]  I might just try.
[23391.17s -> 23391.57s]  You know what?
[23391.57s -> 23393.25s]  Why don't we just fucking keep playing it?
[23393.25s -> 23393.81s]  You know what I mean?
[23394.85s -> 23397.72s]  Well, my blood's just beating around the bush
[23397.72s -> 23399.08s]  like I don't know maybe like
[23399.08s -> 23400.60s]  I obviously want to put time into it.
[23401.16s -> 23404.32s]  We'll do it again tomorrow
[23404.88s -> 23415.33s]  because I can't think of anything else
[23415.33s -> 23417.89s]  that I would be doing tomorrow.
[23417.89s -> 23419.09s]  It's Friday, Sam and Max.
[23428.07s -> 23429.59s]  Unless something comes up
[23429.59s -> 23430.95s]  that I know that I would rather do.
[23431.59s -> 23437.73s]  So I do apologize
[23437.73s -> 23438.61s]  if you're one of those people
[23438.61s -> 23440.85s]  that don't really want to watch
[23440.85s -> 23441.73s]  this kind of stream.
[23442.45s -> 23443.40s]  But don't worry.
[23444.48s -> 23445.04s]  Don't worry.
[23445.04s -> 23447.04s]  There's gonna be something fucking crazy
[23447.04s -> 23448.40s]  in like a week or two anyways.
[23448.40s -> 23448.96s]  So don't worry.
[23449.76s -> 23456.88s]  I'm slowly trying to like eat
[23457.44s -> 23459.04s]  and not make a bunch of noises
[23464.12s -> 23467.44s]  but I'm ready to dunk you.
[23467.44s -> 23468.24s]  I hope you are.
[23470.56s -> 23471.52s]  Thank you snoozing copter.
[23471.52s -> 23472.40s]  Thank you daddy.
[23475.06s -> 23476.26s]  I'm just gonna say daddy.
[23476.26s -> 23478.50s]  Thank you daddy for the 15 dollars.
[23479.22s -> 23481.60s]  Thanks for the laughs through the years you goober.
[23481.60s -> 23482.56s]  Thank you daddy.
[23485.25s -> 23486.61s]  You might think it's weird me saying that
[23486.61s -> 23487.57s]  but it would be really weird
[23487.57s -> 23488.69s]  if I said the rest of the name.
[23490.63s -> 23494.20s]  So thank you for the 15 dollars.
[23494.20s -> 23495.56s]  Thank you so much for hanging out here.
[23505.64s -> 23506.61s]  We also had...
[23507.33s -> 23510.50s]  Oh I got cut off here.
[23510.50s -> 23512.02s]  Spaghetti thanks for the five dollars.
[23512.02s -> 23513.22s]  Funniest streamer on Twitch.
[23513.22s -> 23514.02s]  Jermafireman.
[23514.02s -> 23514.90s]  I should make fireman.
[23515.70s -> 23517.91s]  I should make like a fireman game.
[23518.47s -> 23520.07s]  Like a volcano of lava.
[23520.07s -> 23521.11s]  I know what I'm doing tomorrow.
[23525.22s -> 23526.50s]  Thanks for the five dollars spaghetti.
[23527.30s -> 23528.74s]  The Jack thanks for the five dollars.
[23529.38s -> 23530.74s]  I want to take a screenshot
[23530.74s -> 23532.18s]  print it out and hang this on my fridge.
[23532.18s -> 23533.86s]  I'm enjoying your child finger painting
[23533.86s -> 23534.74s]  in 3D stream.
[23535.62s -> 23539.60s]  Well thank you.
[23544.55s -> 23546.47s]  Thank you demonic cucumber for the 250.
[23547.11s -> 23548.55s]  This stream is just the writing
[23548.55s -> 23550.95s]  my sci-fi post-apocalyptic novel
[23550.95s -> 23553.99s]  silence is appreciated joke for five hours.
[23558.52s -> 23561.76s]  But I know but it's like I...
[23570.58s -> 23572.18s]  Do I have to lash out again?
[23572.82s -> 23574.26s]  You're gonna make me lash out again?
[23580.34s -> 23581.30s]  I lashed out.
[23581.30s -> 23581.62s]  I did.
[23583.17s -> 23585.01s]  I put up the shield and I defended myself.
[23589.78s -> 23591.62s]  I was like shut the fuck up!
[23592.18s -> 23592.82s]  Shut up!
[23594.13s -> 23594.69s]  What'd you say?
[23594.69s -> 23595.41s]  What'd you say to me?
[23596.95s -> 23598.07s]  For like an hour straight.
[23603.20s -> 23605.28s]  And then I just I got I got confused.
[23605.28s -> 23606.16s]  I was looking at a mirror
[23607.76s -> 23610.96s]  and then I went on to talk to um chat.
[23610.96s -> 23614.24s]  It was like oh anyways um yeah you guys
[23614.24s -> 23615.44s]  I'm really trying to work on
[23615.44s -> 23616.96s]  to be better at dreams and
[23617.68s -> 23622.77s]  don't make me lash out again.
[23627.48s -> 23629.08s]  Was it like the war brand stream?
[23629.08s -> 23630.28s]  No no no no.
[23631.94s -> 23634.42s]  There was just a certain percentage of people
[23634.42s -> 23636.42s]  that didn't want to watch me do this
[23637.30s -> 23639.01s]  and I said
[23641.49s -> 23648.64s]  okay and that was it.
[23659.46s -> 23661.03s]  But no.
[23661.03s -> 23661.51s]  I kid.
[23662.72s -> 23663.76s]  Thank you for the 250.
[23666.85s -> 23668.53s]  Thank you to Smotherum.
[23669.49s -> 23671.25s]  This is 50 dollars from Smotherum.
[23671.97s -> 23678.71s]  I missed 50 dollars.
[23678.71s -> 23680.31s]  5,000 bits from Smotherum.
[23684.16s -> 23686.48s]  Your lake seems to have many layers
[23686.48s -> 23687.52s]  Mr. Jermis Sir.
[23688.32s -> 23691.01s]  Your lake seems to have many a layer.
[23693.89s -> 23694.29s]  It did.
[23694.93s -> 23699.06s]  Did I have too many layers?
[23700.02s -> 23703.43s]  Thank you for the 50 dollars.
[23703.43s -> 23704.55s]  That's an insane amount of money.
[23704.55s -> 23704.87s]  Thank you.
[23705.51s -> 23706.63s]  Freudian weapon.
[23706.63s -> 23707.59s]  Thanks for the 250.
[23708.23s -> 23709.65s]  That's quite the masterpiece
[23709.65s -> 23710.05s]  you're making.
[23710.05s -> 23710.69s]  Nicely done.
[23711.88s -> 23712.44s]  Practicing.
[23713.70s -> 23714.26s]  Daddio.
[23714.26s -> 23715.46s]  Thanks for the 10 bucks Daddio.
[23716.72s -> 23717.60s]  10 dollars from Daddio.
[23717.60s -> 23719.44s]  Anything I can do to help you through art school.
[23720.50s -> 23721.06s]  Hey thanks.
[23727.40s -> 23728.20s]  Future gamer.
[23728.20s -> 23729.24s]  Thanks for the 250.
[23729.80s -> 23732.00s]  I had a dream that involved you.
[23732.64s -> 23736.66s]  The dream started with me on this huge cube shaped building
[23736.66s -> 23738.34s]  and I decided to enter it.
[23738.34s -> 23740.82s]  I soon found out that I was trapped inside
[23740.82s -> 23742.34s]  so I started looking for an exit.
[23742.98s -> 23746.02s]  I somehow knew that the very center of the building had horses
[23746.58s -> 23748.74s]  and horses would help me escape so I head there.
[23749.38s -> 23753.78s]  I was walking and I saw a weird gray slime start flowing out of a wall
[23754.66s -> 23757.78s]  and in my head that meant that a monster was nearby.
[23757.78s -> 23759.46s]  I grabbed an axe and killed it.
[23760.34s -> 23761.22s]  I kept going.
[23761.22s -> 23764.10s]  It was at this point of the dream that I found my actual house.
[23764.10s -> 23767.30s]  I went to my bedroom and went on Twitch to watch you stream.
[23767.30s -> 23769.86s]  You were making your way through the same cube shaped building
[23769.86s -> 23771.46s]  trying to find the horses.
[23771.46s -> 23774.74s]  People in chat were all arguing in caps about how there were no horses
[23774.74s -> 23776.58s]  and that you were going the wrong way.
[23776.58s -> 23778.74s]  I turned off the stream and tried to sleep
[23778.74s -> 23781.70s]  but I was too scared that a monster was going to enter my room.
[23781.70s -> 23784.50s]  I just sort of ended up in my bathroom and took a bath.
[23785.22s -> 23789.14s]  I was just relaxing in my bathtub trying not to freak out from possible monsters.
[23789.78s -> 23792.98s]  All of a sudden more of that gray slime burst out of the faucet
[23792.98s -> 23794.90s]  and it got all over me and into my mouth.
[23795.46s -> 23797.22s]  I was trying to claw my way out of the bath
[23797.22s -> 23799.22s]  but it was too slippery and I could not leave.
[23800.02s -> 23801.22s]  This is when the dream ended.
[23801.22s -> 23802.10s]  Interpret this please.
[23808.55s -> 23810.64s]  I don't know.
[23810.64s -> 23812.32s]  The gray slime is maybe...
[23812.32s -> 23812.80s]  I don't know.
[23817.96s -> 23819.24s]  Why do I need to interpret that?
[23819.24s -> 23821.16s]  The only thing that I had to do with that
[23821.80s -> 23824.68s]  was you happened to watch my stream for five seconds.
[23826.21s -> 23828.53s]  You got like gray slime going into your mouth.
[23828.53s -> 23829.73s]  I have nothing to do with that.
[23829.73s -> 23831.33s]  You just watched me on camera.
[23831.33s -> 23832.37s]  You just watched my stream.
[23841.27s -> 23843.19s]  No horses thing fucking killed me.
[23847.08s -> 23853.72s]  Well, Future Gamer, that was $7.50 worth of dream.
[23855.84s -> 23856.72s]  I don't know.
[23856.72s -> 23860.08s]  Maybe the gray slime represents something that you're holding back
[23860.08s -> 23861.36s]  or something that you're afraid of
[23862.00s -> 23863.28s]  and you don't want it to catch up with you.
[23870.29s -> 23871.17s]  Make it in dreams.
[23871.73s -> 23878.77s]  You're going the wrong way.
[23878.77s -> 23880.13s]  There are no horses.
[23880.13s -> 23881.65s]  I've seen that already.
[23883.78s -> 23885.22s]  Demoniccucumber, thanks for the 250.
[23885.22s -> 23887.86s]  Welcome back to the German 95 Conspiracy Corner.
[23887.86s -> 23891.06s]  Today we're going to explore theories of italics being the man behind the mask.
[23891.14s -> 23893.78s]  After Germa's death in January, the Phantom of the Germopera.
[23895.30s -> 23897.70s]  Here it's important to...
[23899.30s -> 23903.12s]  All right, dude, this is freaking me out.
[23908.95s -> 23910.39s]  I think it just blue-screened my computer.
[23911.03s -> 23918.63s]  I don't even know what to say about that.
[23918.63s -> 23920.23s]  That's absolutely strange.
[23921.27s -> 23923.59s]  It's important to note that italics has a history of faking appearances
[23923.59s -> 23924.79s]  and had plenty of time to prepare.
[23925.43s -> 23926.87s]  Besides, Germa's death is canon.
[23926.87s -> 23927.51s]  I checked the wiki.
[23927.51s -> 23930.47s]  Join us next time as we explore the mysterious disappearance of Shito
[23930.47s -> 23931.91s]  and its dastardly cover-up.
[23933.22s -> 23933.72s]  Oh.
[23934.74s -> 23935.46s]  The disappearance.
[23937.41s -> 23941.94s]  You mean of this guy?
[23943.27s -> 23943.83s]  Disappeared.
[23944.85s -> 23945.41s]  Disappeared.
[23945.97s -> 23954.20s]  It's just fine.
[23954.20s -> 23957.72s]  Uh, Great Lord Walden gave 40 community subs an absolute shitload.
[23957.72s -> 23958.36s]  Thank you so much.
[23960.28s -> 23961.96s]  That is a lot of community subs.
[23965.24s -> 23967.24s]  And speaking of them, why don't we take a look at them all?
[23967.24s -> 23967.80s]  Fly by.
[23971.72s -> 23974.04s]  Thank you for your incredible generosity, everybody.
[23975.33s -> 23977.57s]  And your support of this channel.
[23980.04s -> 23981.00s]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[23986.80s -> 23987.68s]  Gunther.
[23987.68s -> 23989.04s]  Thank you, Gunther, for the three dollars.
[23989.04s -> 23989.68s]  Bits to go.
[23990.80s -> 23992.88s]  1060 bits to go till I get the hexagon.
[23992.88s -> 23994.40s]  Been a while since I've been able to donate or sub,
[23994.40s -> 23996.16s]  but I'm making money again, baby.
[23997.38s -> 23998.26s]  Glad you're making some money.
[23998.98s -> 24000.32s]  Thank you for the three dollars.
[24003.73s -> 24004.93s]  Really appreciate it.
[24004.93s -> 24006.37s]  Congratulations on making some money.
[24010.69s -> 24012.87s]  Thank you.
[24012.87s -> 24013.51s]  MultiTrip.
[24013.51s -> 24014.95s]  Ten dollars for MultiTrip.
[24014.95s -> 24016.79s]  Don't worry about dreams being tough to learn.
[24016.79s -> 24018.31s]  I know how to 3D model and draw,
[24018.31s -> 24021.67s]  and I still couldn't get past the bad controls to make something for today.
[24028.08s -> 24033.04s]  Well, it's just really...
[24033.84s -> 24037.33s]  Your brain kind of hits a wall when you sculpt.
[24037.97s -> 24042.04s]  But I do appreciate the effort.
[24042.93s -> 24043.81s]  I think it's a great game.
[24044.37s -> 24047.54s]  I just, like we were saying a few hours ago,
[24048.96s -> 24051.12s]  I don't know what the target audience is.
[24051.12s -> 24052.08s]  I don't know where they're going with it.
[24054.90s -> 24059.38s]  It's kind of too hard to have anybody care about it for like a few hours a week.
[24060.71s -> 24063.91s]  And it's not unity or unreal.
[24068.07s -> 24069.83s]  It kind of sits in this weird place
[24069.83s -> 24072.79s]  where it's so elaborate and has so much shit you can do
[24072.79s -> 24074.71s]  that it's almost too much stuff you can do
[24074.71s -> 24077.19s]  to the point where I don't know if anyone's going to use it.
[24077.91s -> 24084.66s]  The controls really aren't that bad.
[24084.66s -> 24087.14s]  They're just very different than anything that's been done with a controller.
[24089.46s -> 24090.58s]  Yeah, I mean, that's true.
[24091.46s -> 24095.68s]  I think it's supposed to be aimed for everyone,
[24095.68s -> 24098.48s]  but the learning curve is really steep, but it offers so much.
[24099.44s -> 24107.67s]  It's a lot of tools in one.
[24107.67s -> 24109.83s]  It's a lot more fun to use than a usual game engine.
[24109.83s -> 24111.97s]  Yeah, that's also true.
[24112.61s -> 24117.99s]  Because I definitely found myself getting frustrated.
[24119.04s -> 24123.36s]  And obviously, I know I'm not an artistically-inclined person.
[24124.24s -> 24127.01s]  There's some people that are wonderful and can sculpt.
[24127.65s -> 24131.09s]  But for somebody that is not artistically-inclined
[24131.09s -> 24132.93s]  in the traditional sense, I guess,
[24133.97s -> 24135.89s]  it's frustrating to use those controllers.
[24137.41s -> 24138.53s]  I'm going to try to use...
[24140.13s -> 24140.93s]  I'm going to go for it.
[24140.93s -> 24142.53s]  I'm going to get up early tomorrow.
[24142.53s -> 24144.21s]  I'm going to go get a PlayStation camera.
[24144.77s -> 24146.05s]  I have my Move controllers.
[24146.05s -> 24147.33s]  I'm going to try to use them.
[24148.29s -> 24150.40s]  And we'll see if they make a difference.
[24160.45s -> 24161.49s]  Mad because bad.
[24163.57s -> 24166.44s]  You'd be amazed how nice sculpting is with the sticks.
[24166.44s -> 24168.12s]  I'm looking forward to it because it was...
[24169.72s -> 24173.48s]  I could feel myself getting just really frustrated.
[24174.12s -> 24177.91s]  And I don't want to, you know, do that on stream.
[24177.91s -> 24179.67s]  I don't want to be like, yeah, I don't like this.
[24179.67s -> 24180.39s]  Dumb. Sucks.
[24180.95s -> 24182.74s]  I don't like being that guy.
[24182.74s -> 24188.68s]  So I'm going to make a Trainwreck Scorpion Boss ice cream.
[24188.68s -> 24189.16s]  No, I'm not.
[24192.18s -> 24194.18s]  We're going to make a platformer tomorrow.
[24194.18s -> 24198.55s]  I'm going to make a...
[24198.55s -> 24200.23s]  I'm going to just make a big space.
[24200.87s -> 24202.55s]  Cubes and platforms.
[24202.55s -> 24203.35s]  I'm just going to try it.
[24204.15s -> 24211.96s]  I told you we're going to make a fireman platform.
[24211.96s -> 24213.00s]  We're going to make fireman first.
[24214.98s -> 24216.42s]  We're going to bring in some assets, too.
[24216.42s -> 24217.94s]  I'm not going to make everything from scratch.
[24217.94s -> 24218.66s]  Nobody does that.
[24219.46s -> 24223.41s]  Except for the talented people, you know, talented people do that.
[24224.29s -> 24229.92s]  Is it going to be a story?
[24230.48s -> 24233.60s]  I don't know if I'm that well-versed to make a story.
[24234.32s -> 24242.53s]  Would you mind tweeting out about the dunk tank stream when it comes around?
[24242.53s -> 24245.33s]  Oh, you will know where very much in advance.
[24247.99s -> 24250.55s]  That's going to have a set date and a set time.
[24251.27s -> 24253.11s]  At least a week before it happens.
[24253.11s -> 24253.75s]  So don't worry.
[24254.71s -> 24262.53s]  In a few months, you're going to be making games.
[24265.62s -> 24268.02s]  Well, that's one of the reasons why I got, like,
[24269.43s -> 24272.15s]  pissy pants over the things people were saying in chat today.
[24273.03s -> 24275.59s]  Well, not really, but it's because I...
[24275.59s -> 24275.91s]  All right.
[24276.79s -> 24278.71s]  To be able to make something, I need to spend time in it.
[24278.71s -> 24282.39s]  To spend time in it, I have to put the hours in to be here.
[24282.39s -> 24284.55s]  To put the hours in, I need to do it on stream
[24284.55s -> 24286.47s]  because I can't really do it off stream.
[24286.55s -> 24288.87s]  So it's almost like the cycle of...
[24289.59s -> 24293.11s]  It's either stream me learning it or don't,
[24293.11s -> 24296.23s]  and just spend 10 hours a day learning it for, like, two weeks.
[24302.92s -> 24305.16s]  It's kind of a rock-and-a-hard place in that scenario.
[24315.70s -> 24318.02s]  And I figure, I mean, if I'm going to try,
[24318.02s -> 24318.90s]  I might as well stream it.
[24318.90s -> 24320.42s]  Otherwise, I'm just going to do it off stream.
[24321.30s -> 24323.59s]  At the same time, it's hard to please everyone.
[24324.23s -> 24325.35s]  Yeah, but I know that.
[24325.35s -> 24328.47s]  And look, I was not that angry today.
[24329.56s -> 24330.28s]  Not even close.
[24331.00s -> 24333.96s]  At least you don't sometimes want to, you know,
[24333.96s -> 24335.56s]  see, tell people where I'm coming from.
[24335.56s -> 24337.40s]  You know, that's my side of the story.
[24343.19s -> 24353.41s]  This game definitely has potential.
[24355.25s -> 24358.32s]  It does.
[24364.29s -> 24365.01s]  But I'm going to...
[24365.81s -> 24369.44s]  I wonder if I can go get the camera now.
[24369.44s -> 24370.72s]  Is anything open in...
[24370.72s -> 24372.24s]  I mean, I live in Las Vegas.
[24373.33s -> 24374.29s]  Everything's fucking open.
[24378.95s -> 24380.63s]  That ice technique was really nice.
[24382.45s -> 24384.61s]  It's fun to have your Rika moments and just do it.
[24385.17s -> 24388.77s]  I just wish I knew more and knew about where things should be
[24388.77s -> 24389.49s]  and how to do them.
[24389.97s -> 24392.21s]  It's funny because if you give me 3D movie maker right now,
[24393.01s -> 24395.81s]  I could show you every fucking little technique,
[24395.81s -> 24397.09s]  every tiny little thing.
[24399.92s -> 24401.20s]  Weird workarounds.
[24401.20s -> 24403.36s]  And I will never forget that stuff.
[24403.36s -> 24404.32s]  It's burned in my brain forever.
[24412.82s -> 24415.96s]  I feel like some people think every stream has to be
[24415.96s -> 24417.96s]  a high energy clown comedy stream.
[24422.32s -> 24425.28s]  Yeah, but that's kind of my fault, though.
[24425.28s -> 24425.92s]  You know what I mean?
[24425.92s -> 24427.76s]  Like, I do these...
[24428.96s -> 24431.68s]  A lot of my streams are like fucking high energy
[24431.68s -> 24433.28s]  fucking clown comedy streams.
[24434.00s -> 24435.36s]  So I can understand when people come here
[24435.36s -> 24436.08s]  and they're like, wait, he's...
[24437.12s -> 24438.80s]  He's just going to play Dreams?
[24439.52s -> 24441.12s]  And he's going to just sculpt?
[24442.93s -> 24443.17s]  Why?
[24443.97s -> 24446.07s]  Where's like the car crash?
[24446.79s -> 24449.70s]  A lot of that's my own doing, right?
[24450.42s -> 24459.04s]  Wouldn't blame you.
[24459.04s -> 24460.00s]  No, and I'm not...
[24460.96s -> 24463.84s]  I'm really not trying to make this some kind of
[24465.16s -> 24466.28s]  thing about, well, you know,
[24466.28s -> 24468.68s]  I really wish I could do this and not have to work.
[24469.32s -> 24469.96s]  No, it's all good.
[24472.04s -> 24472.76s]  I was not...
[24473.56s -> 24476.60s]  I'm kind of making this more of a bigger deal than it was today.
[24476.60s -> 24477.72s]  It just wasn't at all.
[24478.60s -> 24482.23s]  I mentioned it for like maybe 30 seconds.
[24486.72s -> 24489.68s]  You set the bar too high with the scorpion battle.
[24489.68s -> 24491.28s]  Should I have not pulled that out so quickly?
[24491.28s -> 24491.84s]  Because then I went...
[24491.84s -> 24492.32s]  Yeah, you know what?
[24492.32s -> 24494.08s]  I went from that to just like making a mountain.
[24498.66s -> 24499.06s]  I just...
[24499.06s -> 24501.46s]  Yeah, I went from that to snow covered mountain.
[24514.47s -> 24517.68s]  You started with the main event.
[24518.66s -> 24522.50s]  Yeah, but I wanted you to see what I did.
[24528.53s -> 24531.01s]  You gave them Hogan versus Andre first.
[24531.73s -> 24533.99s]  Yeah, but do you think...
[24533.99s -> 24535.83s]  All right, do you think anyone would have stuck around
[24535.83s -> 24539.91s]  if I started with the snow covered mountains?
[24541.41s -> 24544.53s]  No, people could see the potential with the scorpion boss battle.
[24544.53s -> 24548.05s]  They know, holy shit, this isn't just a snow covered mountain stream.
[24548.69s -> 24561.97s]  You know, content creation is hard.
[24561.97s -> 24563.09s]  You never know what to start with.
[24563.65s -> 24565.92s]  Start with a beetle battle.
[24565.92s -> 24566.56s]  You know what?
[24566.56s -> 24567.44s]  Maybe I'll just stay...
[24567.44s -> 24567.76s]  I don't know.
[24567.76s -> 24570.50s]  Maybe I'll just be a psycho.
[24573.27s -> 24574.79s]  I said this last time, but I might...
[24574.79s -> 24576.15s]  Maybe I'll just be a psycho tonight
[24576.15s -> 24577.59s]  and I'll just make a bunch of stuff tonight.
[24585.16s -> 24585.88s]  And then just...
[24585.88s -> 24587.40s]  I'm streaming early tomorrow.
[24592.24s -> 24592.64s]  Maybe.
[24598.34s -> 24599.38s]  No, but then I got to like...
[24599.38s -> 24600.74s]  I got to go.
[24600.74s -> 24607.04s]  I have to like drive, so I can't do that.
[24607.04s -> 24608.48s]  No, I don't want to like...
[24608.48s -> 24609.44s]  No, that's not a good idea.
[24610.24s -> 24614.20s]  What's tomorrow?
[24614.20s -> 24615.80s]  Tomorrow is an early stream.
[24615.80s -> 24618.76s]  And then I have to take Otto to the bed.
[24619.32s -> 24627.44s]  So we're going to go for like six hours before five.
[24631.75s -> 24634.15s]  But let's finish up the bits.
[24634.15s -> 24635.03s]  We're at the end here.
[24637.08s -> 24638.92s]  The bala koala gave $14.
[24638.92s -> 24640.12s]  Dude, stop looking for horses.
[24640.12s -> 24641.08s]  There are no horses.
[24641.08s -> 24641.72s]  Fail fish.
[24643.73s -> 24644.05s]  Shut up.
[24644.05s -> 24644.53s]  Yes, there are.
[24645.25s -> 24648.61s]  Thank you for the $14, bala koala.
[24648.61s -> 24650.93s]  Thank you Sikilos for the five bucks.
[24651.81s -> 24654.69s]  Jerma, would you mind tweeting out info about the dunk tank stream?
[24654.69s -> 24655.09s]  This is...
[24655.09s -> 24655.97s]  We caught that earlier.
[24656.85s -> 24657.41s]  Yes, yes.
[24658.05s -> 24660.53s]  My friends and I want to plan a big watch party for it.
[24660.53s -> 24662.53s]  Well, it's not going to be like next week.
[24663.49s -> 24665.01s]  I will give you at least one week notice.
[24665.97s -> 24669.33s]  I'm like trying to prod every single resource here
[24669.89s -> 24672.05s]  to get this going in the next couple weeks.
[24676.32s -> 24679.44s]  If that goes well, that stream is going to be a ton of fucking fun.
[24679.44s -> 24687.57s]  Am I still live?
[24688.29s -> 24689.25s]  Did we actually turn off?
[24689.89s -> 24692.16s]  I think we may have actually turned off.
[24692.80s -> 24696.08s]  Maybe not.
[24696.64s -> 24698.53s]  I think we're still on.
[24701.81s -> 24703.41s]  But yeah, you will know far in advance.
[24703.41s -> 24704.05s]  I'll tweet about it.
[24704.05s -> 24704.85s]  I'll talk about it.
[24704.85s -> 24707.73s]  And I'll give some actual detail, detailed details
[24707.73s -> 24710.31s]  of how it's going to work when it does happen.
[24712.18s -> 24716.02s]  Hey C2K, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[24716.02s -> 24718.98s]  Hey Jerma, are you ever going to play God of War of the 2018 one?
[24719.62s -> 24721.80s]  I mean, the PlayStation is hooked up right now.
[24723.32s -> 24727.94s]  So maybe I'll just do that after Sam and Max or something.
[24731.12s -> 24732.16s]  Sounds like a fun game.
[24732.88s -> 24734.02s]  It looks amazing.
[24736.02s -> 24737.30s]  Thank you for the $10.
[24737.30s -> 24738.90s]  And yes, I do plan on playing it.
[24741.19s -> 24743.35s]  Hey Mr. Comcast, thanks for the six bucks.
[24743.91s -> 24746.10s]  Are you going to bail me out here, Mr. Comcast?
[24746.10s -> 24748.42s]  Hey Jerma, John Comcast here sitting in my screwed McDuck bank
[24748.42s -> 24749.62s]  while the money got me thinking.
[24750.34s -> 24755.09s]  Well, what if money can't buy us true happiness?
[24755.65s -> 24757.25s]  It's a question that I ponder often
[24757.25s -> 24759.09s]  and I was wondering if you knew the answer.
[24759.09s -> 24760.93s]  Also in other news, can you move the billions
[24760.93s -> 24763.57s]  that are in your overseas Swiss bank account somewhere else?
[24763.57s -> 24766.77s]  You're clogging it up for all of us other rich boomers.
[24766.77s -> 24768.37s]  If you don't move it, I'll be forced to tell people
[24768.37s -> 24770.45s]  about the Ponzi scheme you run on your Twitch stream.
[24775.04s -> 24781.94s]  Sure, well, no, I don't think money buys happiness
[24781.94s -> 24783.46s]  and happiness comes from within.
[24785.49s -> 24787.49s]  Happiness comes from within.
[24788.82s -> 24795.75s]  Happiness comes from within.
[24795.75s -> 24799.25s]  Um, get your fucking money out of my way.
[24801.03s -> 24803.43s]  I got plenty of those bank accounts in mine.
[24803.43s -> 24805.91s]  I've got the paper signed over Mr. John Comcast.
[24805.91s -> 24807.27s]  You ain't going to get your hands on any of it.
[24808.07s -> 24815.70s]  Oh no, it's happiness.
[24815.70s -> 24816.34s]  It's escaping.
[24817.06s -> 24828.12s]  But money can insulate you from exterior factors
[24828.12s -> 24829.00s]  that can make you unhappy.
[24829.00s -> 24829.56s]  That's true.
[24830.28s -> 24830.84s]  That is true.
[24831.88s -> 24838.29s]  But here, you know when you put a,
[24838.29s -> 24839.97s]  you know the whole goldfish in the bowl thing?
[24839.97s -> 24841.49s]  The goldfish just gets bigger,
[24841.49s -> 24842.61s]  the bigger the bowl you put it in.
[24848.58s -> 24854.00s]  It's almost like even if you have a million dollars,
[24857.64s -> 24861.57s]  your life kind of just, that becomes normal.
[24863.25s -> 24865.89s]  And even having a million dollar life,
[24865.89s -> 24867.25s]  like a multi-million dollar life,
[24867.97s -> 24870.85s]  cannot like buy you love.
[24871.81s -> 24872.37s]  It can't.
[24873.09s -> 24874.29s]  Oh, did we get cut off?
[24875.17s -> 24880.13s]  I think I was about to say something really, really important.
[24882.63s -> 24883.83s]  What the fuck is going on?
[24885.48s -> 24887.48s]  It hasn't been this bad in like months.
[24894.80s -> 24897.28s]  Well, I did not expect it to be this bad tonight.
[24898.85s -> 24912.10s]  Um, well, okay.
[24912.74s -> 24915.72s]  You got it out of your system now?
[24915.72s -> 24916.68s]  You're going to keep doing it?
[24916.68s -> 24918.44s]  You're going to keep cutting me off or what?
[24922.90s -> 24924.66s]  Money could buy some better internet.
[24924.66s -> 24939.09s]  You think that would be true, but it's not true.
[24939.09s -> 24943.80s]  Uh, what was I saying?
[24944.52s -> 24949.40s]  I sure would love to tell you what I was saying.
[24950.20s -> 24958.53s]  Oh God, it went down to zero again.
[24962.69s -> 24963.73s]  What the fuck?
[24973.59s -> 24975.83s]  You know, I'm, I'm just going to type it.
[24975.83s -> 24981.00s]  I'm, I'm going to type it because I can't say it.
[25055.17s -> 25068.69s]  Okay, got it done.
[25068.69s -> 25069.89s]  Okay. Can I, can you hear me?
[25077.62s -> 25078.90s]  That's a new coffee.
[25078.90s -> 25079.94s]  Okay. All right.
[25079.94s -> 25081.94s]  No, I think, I think I can speak again.
[25085.51s -> 25091.08s]  So yes, money alleviates the burdens of life to have a comfortable life,
[25091.08s -> 25093.08s]  but it cannot put people in it.
[25093.08s -> 25098.76s]  And as humans, we strive and we long for true friendship,
[25098.76s -> 25101.48s]  true love and things to share with other people.
[25102.28s -> 25103.00s]  We long for it.
[25103.00s -> 25103.48s]  We want it.
[25104.12s -> 25105.48s]  You can't buy it.
[25105.48s -> 25110.60s]  You can buy, you can buy pretend, but not the real thing.
[25110.60s -> 25111.72s]  And we all want the real thing.
[25112.28s -> 25117.03s]  So, you know, you could have $5,000 in your checking account.
[25117.03s -> 25119.67s]  You could have $5 million in your checking account.
[25119.67s -> 25124.87s]  The $5,000 checking account person may have a ton of fucking great friends
[25125.43s -> 25128.15s]  and a bunch of wonderful people in their life.
[25128.15s -> 25131.91s]  Somebody that they love and they just live their life.
[25131.91s -> 25135.19s]  The person with the $5 million might have,
[25135.19s -> 25137.99s]  might pay for a bunch of shit and might own a bunch of cool stuff,
[25137.99s -> 25139.59s]  but they might not have anybody to share it with.
[25140.55s -> 25142.79s]  Or the people that they are sharing it with might,
[25142.79s -> 25144.07s]  they might not have a true connection.
[25149.40s -> 25151.80s]  I know this because I have $4 million in my bank account
[25151.80s -> 25153.56s]  and everybody fucking hates my guts.
[25153.56s -> 25154.52s]  Nobody likes me.
[25154.52s -> 25155.64s]  No, I'm just, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
[25156.52s -> 25159.08s]  I would, I don't have that much money.
[25164.10s -> 25168.66s]  I do not have even remotely a percentage of that.
[25169.30s -> 25173.70s]  That's not water.
[25173.70s -> 25175.38s]  It's a seltzer water, relax.
[25178.02s -> 25188.26s]  But no, I'm a firm believer of the only reason why you really do anything at all
[25189.97s -> 25195.01s]  is because it's somehow some way you want to share it with someone.
[25195.89s -> 25198.24s]  You know, oh, I want to go out.
[25198.24s -> 25199.60s]  I want to go out to dinner tonight.
[25199.60s -> 25200.56s]  I want to go out to dinner.
[25200.56s -> 25201.06s]  Why?
[25201.44s -> 25203.04s]  Well, because I like this restaurant.
[25203.04s -> 25204.48s]  But why do you want to go to that restaurant?
[25205.28s -> 25206.48s]  Because they have good food?
[25207.28s -> 25207.84s]  Anything else?
[25209.24s -> 25210.92s]  Uh, well, hold on.
[25210.92s -> 25211.64s]  I went to zero.
[25212.36s -> 25217.06s]  No, we're back.
[25217.06s -> 25217.56s]  Okay.
[25220.69s -> 25224.37s]  But whenever you go deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper, and you think about it,
[25225.57s -> 25229.73s]  you want to go to that nice restaurant with somebody
[25229.73s -> 25232.61s]  so you can experience the food together so you can...
[25233.73s -> 25235.33s]  It's like this human thing.
[25236.05s -> 25239.81s]  I want to go to the restaurant because, oh, hey, how is that?
[25239.81s -> 25242.21s]  Is that, is that, is the pasta good?
[25242.77s -> 25243.57s]  It is good.
[25243.57s -> 25245.01s]  Yeah, it's good, isn't it?
[25245.25s -> 25246.05s]  I got the chicken.
[25246.05s -> 25246.77s]  Oh, it's amazing.
[25246.77s -> 25247.27s]  You want to try?
[25249.84s -> 25250.96s]  Yeah, no, it's really good.
[25250.96s -> 25252.08s]  Yeah, try it, try it.
[25252.08s -> 25254.96s]  Yeah, I really like that wine that they were serving.
[25254.96s -> 25256.00s]  It was really good wine, wasn't it?
[25259.81s -> 25261.01s]  Experiences with other people.
[25270.55s -> 25274.60s]  And they don't all have to be at like a restaurant.
[25274.60s -> 25277.65s]  There are plenty of, you know, does it cost?
[25277.65s -> 25281.97s]  I mean, of course it costs something to, you know, use the internet.
[25282.69s -> 25285.97s]  But I know a lot of people that have a bunch of friends that are online
[25285.97s -> 25289.57s]  that they've met through, you know, playing video games.
[25289.57s -> 25290.85s]  And look at half of the people that I know.
[25292.05s -> 25293.81s]  The connections that I've made with people
[25294.53s -> 25296.45s]  because we were making YouTube videos and shit.
[25300.08s -> 25302.80s]  I think, I think it's nothing to do with money.
[25302.80s -> 25305.60s]  It has to do with having experiences with other people that you like.
[25308.60s -> 25311.80s]  Unless you go to a 3D movie by yourself, which is fine.
[25312.60s -> 25313.08s]  I did it.
[25314.56s -> 25315.92s]  And you're the only person in the theater
[25315.92s -> 25318.72s]  and you get to experience the 3D movie alone.
[25318.72s -> 25320.32s]  It was fucking cool and it was great.
[25321.12s -> 25331.70s]  And experience like a cooking stream.
[25338.95s -> 25342.98s]  But that's not all about the dollar.
[25343.62s -> 25348.28s]  There are plenty of people that are not happy with lots of money.
[25348.28s -> 25350.44s]  And there are plenty of people that aren't happy that don't have money.
[25350.44s -> 25353.00s]  There are plenty of people that are really happy that don't have a lot of money.
[25353.64s -> 25354.68s]  It's just who the person is.
[25356.58s -> 25361.86s]  And I'm like, I'm not going to pretend like, no, it's money doesn't do it.
[25361.86s -> 25362.82s]  Money does a lot.
[25362.82s -> 25363.22s]  It does.
[25364.87s -> 25368.39s]  But it will not fill the human connection.
[25368.39s -> 25373.22s]  And with that, that's my talk.
[25373.22s -> 25375.86s]  And I will see you guys tomorrow afternoon, early this time.
[25375.86s -> 25376.74s]  Make sure you get up.
[25377.62s -> 25379.06s]  We've got some stuff to do.
[25384.52s -> 25386.52s]  Which WWE game is the best 2K14?
[25387.67s -> 25389.19s]  The rest are terrible.
[25389.19s -> 25393.03s]  2K, well, 2K13, 2K12.
[25393.03s -> 25394.31s]  Okay, maybe they're pretty good.
[25395.11s -> 25396.63s]  Everything after 2K14 is awful.
[25400.52s -> 25401.32s]  There it is.
[25401.32s -> 25402.93s]  Have a good night.
[25402.93s -> 25404.69s]  I will hopefully have an internet that works tomorrow.
[25404.69s -> 25405.17s]  That'd be great.
[25405.97s -> 25409.09s]  And I'll see you guys very soon, actually.
[25409.33s -> 25411.33s]  Less than what?
[25411.33s -> 25413.00s]  Less than 12 hours?
[25413.00s -> 25416.44s]  11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[25416.44s -> 25418.92s]  Yeah, I'll see you guys in less than 12 to 14 hours.
[25419.88s -> 25420.96s]  Have a great night.
[25421.60s -> 25422.80s]  See you real soon.
