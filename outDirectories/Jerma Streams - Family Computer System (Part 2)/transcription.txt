[0.89s -> 15.37s]  Early. Well, I'm early because I have food here, and I don't want it to get cold. How are you guys doing? Hope everybody's doing good.
[17.95s -> 25.70s]  It's gonna take a lot of concentration for me to do this. I'm gonna try as hard as I can, but I'm gonna hope I don't crack.
[29.18s -> 36.62s]  Today, we're going to begin by eating a Whopper from Burger King and a few other items.
[36.62s -> 46.54s]  So, uh, this is very specific. If you know, you know. And I'm not gonna explain it again.
[47.54s -> 60.59s]  So if you have no idea why I'm doing this, then just hate me in about 15 minutes. I know, I know.
[61.59s -> 69.59s]  The people that weren't here a few weeks ago, they're just gonna be like, what the fuck is wrong with you? Why are you doing this? I have to do this.
[69.59s -> 79.42s]  It's been, this has been burned in my mind. I have to, I have to do this. I need to.
[82.51s -> 87.71s]  But anyways, stop stalling and eat it. Hold on a second. That's why I started early.
[89.34s -> 97.64s]  I have a Whopper with cheese, a Chicken Junior, and some Burger King french fries. And let's get, wait, no, don't eat anything. Don't touch anything.
[98.64s -> 112.85s]  Please, I can't, I can't read what you said. I can hear the Whopper. You hear that wrapping paper? You hear that wrapping, hold on.
[113.85s -> 120.85s]  Oh, don't open it yet. Hold on, people aren't here. I can't believe he's doing this. Well, believe it.
[121.85s -> 126.60s]  Because it's, I'm doing it. And I'm gonna try as hard as I can to do what I told you I wanted to do.
[127.60s -> 134.31s]  I've like tried to like get like a bunch of laughs and shit out of me. I've tried as hard as I could.
[134.31s -> 141.00s]  I did like some breathing exercises to make sure I can do this. Eat it in 20 seconds? What?
[142.00s -> 152.58s]  I have to get it out now. That's why I started a little early because I need to like get it out of my system.
[153.58s -> 161.57s]  I stole a french fry. I'm sorry. Everybody's going to fucking hate this. I don't care. I like this. I'm doing it.
[162.57s -> 175.46s]  You guys ready? Eat it through the paper? Eat, eat it through the paper. Hi, hi, how you doing?
[175.46s -> 186.84s]  Why am I like blinking? So what I have here, I have a Whopper with cheese. Pretty cool.
[188.59s -> 204.02s]  Now, I also have a Chicken Junior. I don't know what the numbers mean. One to, one to twelve? What's the twelve?
[205.32s -> 215.43s]  What is one? Eat it with the shell on. Eat it with the shell. It's the range of what?
[217.38s -> 223.62s]  But what is the, I don't understand, one through twelve. The numbers are so you can rate it afterwards.
[223.62s -> 236.48s]  One through twelve? That doesn't make any sense. Ooey gooey. I know, just wait. What if he doesn't eat it with the skin on?
[237.48s -> 244.01s]  Okay. So I've got a drink too. I've got a Coke. And I've got french fries, obviously.
[245.01s -> 252.32s]  So, as you guys know, I don't really eat fast food. I'm not a fast food guy. I don't really like it.
[253.32s -> 258.50s]  I find it to be, it's not for me. So I'm not sure I'm going to like this. I really don't think it's going to be something I enjoy.
[259.50s -> 266.55s]  Not a fast food guy. Me. Don't eat it very often. So I'll give it a try though. I'll try it.
[267.86s -> 274.55s]  We're going to start with the Whopper. This is the Whopper with cheese. I don't know about this. I don't know if I'm going to like this.
[276.18s -> 285.61s]  Let's see what it looks like. Okay. It doesn't look that bad. It looks okay. This is the Whopper.
[287.10s -> 293.66s]  I don't know about this. I'll try it. I'll try a bite. And we'll see.
[295.15s -> 323.55s]  Okay. I'm going to go for a bite. Oh my God. Oh my God. It's so good. Oh my God. It's good. It's okay. It's good.
[324.79s -> 343.21s]  Let me try another bite and find out. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. It's so good.
[360.38s -> 374.90s]  You can't see me. Fuck. I already ruined it. It was so hard to do that.
[374.90s -> 408.35s]  I took two bites.
[415.70s -> 433.49s]  I knew I was going to fuck the whole thing up. I'm sorry.
[434.49s -> 443.85s]  Somebody wrote in chat. I shouldn't have looked at chat at all. Somebody wrote, why the fuck is he doing this?
[444.85s -> 456.02s]  And it was no capitals. It was just a random name. Oh my God. I couldn't even get through two bites of doing it.
[457.02s -> 466.19s]  I fucking hate this. All right. Let's go. It's not bad. It's okay.
[471.14s -> 486.27s]  Oh my God. I can't do it anymore. I'm not going to do it anymore.
[488.22s -> 501.48s]  Actually, Burger King sauce went through my nose. Burger King sauce went into my nostrils and out of my nose.
[502.48s -> 509.43s]  And coke at the same time. That sucked. That was not fun. That was horrible.
[512.78s -> 523.92s]  Anyways, let's hold on. I need to wipe my nose. I have whatever's on here coming out of my nose.
[527.53s -> 532.98s]  Please stop this. Let me describe how it tastes.
[535.87s -> 546.93s]  Okay. What I really love about this the most is definitely the cheese. It's got this ooey gooey cheese on it that just melts and gets all over the patty.
[551.94s -> 562.48s]  And the pickle, perfect amount of acidity. It's actually pretty good. I don't hate it.
[566.73s -> 581.20s]  It's a cheese with some adjectives. Thin. Sliced. American. Fresh patty.
[582.20s -> 593.72s]  That one wasn't for a joke. This one was real. You're describing yourself.
[598.86s -> 606.66s]  What's the right amount of acidity exactly? I don't know. Just enough for you to get the little sourness. You get the vinegar flavor.
[611.10s -> 621.30s]  Potatoes. They're perfectly crispy. They're a little gross. But they're pretty good.
[623.25s -> 630.56s]  I actually like Burger King fries. 10k people are watching this cursed garbage.
[642.94s -> 651.30s]  All I wanted out of this was that first scene of the, oh my god, because I want you to use it wherever you want.
[655.86s -> 665.22s]  Say, Ushi, no. And you guys, seriously, you wanted me to do that the entire time I ate this fucking hamburger?
[667.42s -> 672.75s]  There's no way I would have done that. Every single time I take a bite I was supposed to do that.
[672.75s -> 678.59s]  I took two, three bites and I went into a full meltdown. I couldn't do it. I can't do that.
[680.66s -> 684.97s]  What would you use that for? I don't know. For a fucking school project. You could use it as a school project.
[689.22s -> 692.22s]  Is it weird that I find this part to be disgusting and I don't want to bite that part? You know what I mean?
[701.12s -> 706.51s]  Oh my goodness. It's like in my nose. Bite that part? I don't like tomato and shit.
[707.69s -> 708.69s]  I don't like it. There's too much stuff on here.
[711.98s -> 726.72s]  I'm going to part your hair down the middle. No. Okay. A little bit of sourness.
[727.72s -> 732.80s]  Why is the toothbrush still there? Because I feel like I want it there.
[733.80s -> 740.20s]  You know, actually, I'm actually excited to try the chicken sandwich.
[741.20s -> 745.62s]  Stop looking at me in the eyes when you chew.
[746.62s -> 748.43s]  Why? You don't do that when you're hanging out with your friends?
[749.43s -> 753.86s]  You go to a restaurant? You don't do that? Is it weird that I do that?
[754.86s -> 760.44s]  When I like them out of the restaurant, I usually do this. I usually take a big bite of the food like this.
[761.44s -> 773.20s]  I don't want to make a mess. Fucking God damn it.
[774.20s -> 796.26s]  Whoopsie. It's kind of weird, but it's not that bad.
[797.26s -> 800.26s]  I don't do that. We're just having a fun routine here.
[800.26s -> 812.85s]  This bite right here, that's going to be a zonk bite. Zonk bite.
[813.85s -> 826.08s]  He's absolutely zonked. What is it? Zonk? What do you guys say?
[827.08s -> 834.72s]  How's the sauce? It's pretty good. It's kind of a combination of...
[835.72s -> 837.72s]  Although I'm going to give Doc some points here on the Whopper.
[838.72s -> 842.33s]  It's a little runny. I don't like runny sauce.
[843.33s -> 847.38s]  So this is a little runny. Once you get to the middle here.
[847.38s -> 857.60s]  Yeah, that's too runny. If that's too runny, you get minus one full letter grade.
[858.60s -> 876.40s]  Put on predictions. For what? For what? Is this man going to die?
[877.40s -> 880.40s]  I mean, like, eventually? Probably like 50 years?
[883.56s -> 886.56s]  Predicted if you can eat the whole burger in one more minute?
[888.12s -> 892.26s]  The whole rest of the burger in one minute? Um, no.
[893.26s -> 895.78s]  Actually, you know what? I could probably do it.
[896.78s -> 901.77s]  Let me take... Can I? Alright, hold on. One minute's a long time.
[902.77s -> 905.74s]  You can do it. You're far.
[905.74s -> 914.06s]  The rest of this in one minute? Wait, I can wait money off the debt if I get to do this in one minute.
[915.06s -> 917.06s]  Why don't you predict? I can do it. I know I can.
[918.06s -> 923.69s]  100 million? That's not worth it. I'll have diarrhea in like fucking four hours.
[924.69s -> 927.99s]  No, none of this is worth it. Nope, not doing that. I'm just going to enjoy it.
[928.99s -> 936.35s]  If you eat a hamburger as fast as you can, guys, you're going to shit your pants.
[937.35s -> 939.49s]  You're going to go... It's going to be horrible.
[940.49s -> 944.98s]  If you eat a full fucking cheeseburger in less than two minutes, you're going to have diarrhea.
[945.98s -> 947.98s]  It's going to happen. It doesn't matter from what restaurant.
[947.98s -> 951.98s]  You can make it in your house, on your sofa, on your sewing machine.
[952.98s -> 954.98s]  You can make it in your own house and it's still going to happen.
[958.46s -> 959.46s]  Okay, the french fries have still got the crisp.
[962.24s -> 966.02s]  Get a look. Pretty decently salted. Okay?
[970.01s -> 972.91s]  Alright, I'm dripping shit all over me. Hold on.
[973.91s -> 978.70s]  Quarter pound of beef. Quarter pound is way better.
[979.70s -> 984.65s]  Yeah. You want my review of the Bird King Whopper?
[985.65s -> 990.34s]  Quarter pound is a hundred times better. Done. Done. Like, that's it.
[993.70s -> 996.70s]  Do I need to give this a score? Quarter pounder is way better.
[1002.86s -> 1003.86s]  Yeah, that's my review. Quarter pounder is better.
[1004.86s -> 1016.26s]  You cameras off center? I'll fix that. How about now?
[1029.96s -> 1030.96s]  The chicken sandwich, I'm going to give it a minute though.
[1031.96s -> 1037.74s]  Jeremy, eat a salad. You're getting fat.
[1038.74s -> 1041.46s]  Good. That's what I want.
[1042.46s -> 1047.15s]  I want to just grow in size. I want to be...
[1048.15s -> 1050.15s]  I told you I was trying to put weight on. I told you that.
[1051.65s -> 1054.65s]  I was like 130 pounds like five months ago, six months ago.
[1055.82s -> 1058.82s]  I've put on like 25 pounds of pure, absolutely fat.
[1059.82s -> 1060.82s]  There's none of its muscle. I haven't really worked out at all.
[1060.82s -> 1061.82s]  I've been trying to do some walking lightly.
[1062.82s -> 1064.51s]  Oh, it's all fat. All of it.
[1065.51s -> 1070.02s]  I've been gaining weight.
[1079.32s -> 1081.88s]  I want to top out somewhere around like 155.
[1083.57s -> 1084.57s]  That's where I'm like, all right, slow down.
[1087.98s -> 1088.98s]  And no, and guys, I'm not eating.
[1089.98s -> 1091.98s]  I'm not eating like Burger King fucking Whoppers every day.
[1092.98s -> 1093.98s]  To get, to gain weight. No.
[1095.22s -> 1096.22s]  I'll give you an endorsement here.
[1098.10s -> 1099.10s]  This is the endorsement part of the stream.
[1101.82s -> 1103.82s]  Those heels, I got that heel for a reason.
[1105.31s -> 1108.68s]  I drank that shit every day, morning and night, to try to put on some weight.
[1108.68s -> 1109.68s]  And it's not, it's not like bad calories.
[1110.68s -> 1111.68s]  They're not like, there's no dead calories in that.
[1112.68s -> 1114.11s]  It actually helped a lot.
[1115.54s -> 1117.72s]  Being able to take the extra calories with liquid.
[1119.22s -> 1120.22s]  That's not just junk.
[1121.78s -> 1123.78s]  And there's no soy in that. Stop saying it.
[1124.78s -> 1125.78s]  I keep seeing that in the chat room and it's making me very upset.
[1126.78s -> 1128.34s]  There is no soy in Huel.
[1129.34s -> 1130.34s]  It's soy free.
[1131.34s -> 1132.34s]  And I know you linked a bunch of bullshit, but the ones I have don't have soy in them.
[1136.78s -> 1137.78s]  There's no soy in Huel.
[1141.26s -> 1144.22s]  You're upsetting me.
[1145.22s -> 1146.22s]  Predict it. No, no, no, no, no.
[1147.22s -> 1148.22s]  Don't predict it. You could just game this.
[1149.46s -> 1152.90s]  How many guys, when you have a french fry, how many folders we got here in the chat?
[1153.90s -> 1154.90s]  How many folders we got?
[1160.23s -> 1163.11s]  We got folders in here? How many folders we got, right?
[1164.54s -> 1165.54s]  How many folders we got?
[1170.43s -> 1171.43s]  That's what a serial killer does.
[1172.43s -> 1177.32s]  How many serial killers are here?
[1178.32s -> 1179.32s]  If it's too big, you have to like spring it in there.
[1184.91s -> 1185.91s]  You can't fold little ones.
[1188.50s -> 1190.50s]  How many guys are, when you get the little thin ones, you go like this.
[1191.50s -> 1195.36s]  Kind of like a bunny rabbit.
[1196.36s -> 1197.36s]  I mean, when I know nobody's watching, I do that.
[1203.85s -> 1205.85s]  How many guys are just, are full swallowers, you know?
[1205.85s -> 1207.85s]  We got folders, we have chompers, what about swallowers?
[1208.85s -> 1209.85s]  You know, you just, it's gone.
[1212.56s -> 1213.86s]  And sometimes you're hungry.
[1214.86s -> 1230.02s]  This is, dude, I choked and fucking, I'm so glad I got out of the camera's way like 10 minutes ago.
[1231.71s -> 1236.10s]  I read that chat message saying like, why the fuck is he doing this?
[1237.10s -> 1240.41s]  And I hope, did I get down fast enough?
[1241.41s -> 1246.50s]  Did I get down there fast enough before like this liquid started coming out of my nose?
[1247.50s -> 1250.47s]  I hope so.
[1250.47s -> 1253.82s]  I hope so.
[1254.82s -> 1259.58s]  What about splitters?
[1260.58s -> 1264.27s]  Dude, the thing that everybody, onion, onion ring, I got an onion ring.
[1265.27s -> 1271.93s]  Burger King just got a half of a point right there.
[1273.55s -> 1276.55s]  You always get one onion ring, treasure chest, buried in the sand of french fries.
[1277.55s -> 1279.62s]  That's a huge moment.
[1281.70s -> 1282.70s]  That's a huge moment.
[1291.87s -> 1293.87s]  I'm kind of freaking myself out because why would, how does that happen?
[1296.90s -> 1297.90s]  I didn't like, hit the ground or anything, right?
[1299.40s -> 1301.66s]  Why does that happen?
[1302.66s -> 1304.61s]  They use the same vat, okay.
[1304.61s -> 1308.61s]  This is an area where like they just like fell all over the counter and somebody was like just scraped them in.
[1310.23s -> 1322.86s]  You're paranoid.
[1323.86s -> 1324.86s]  Don't, cigarette bullshit.
[1326.49s -> 1327.49s]  I want to try the chicken sandwich.
[1332.25s -> 1335.49s]  Ah, already hate it, already hate it.
[1336.49s -> 1337.49s]  Oh, it's getting everywhere.
[1344.17s -> 1345.17s]  I already hate it.
[1347.30s -> 1348.30s]  I don't know about this one.
[1349.86s -> 1354.19s]  I know what a McChicken is like and we'll see, we'll see.
[1357.80s -> 1358.80s]  It's a little sloppy.
[1359.80s -> 1361.74s]  The lettuce is not perfectly packed.
[1361.74s -> 1362.74s]  Let's give it a try.
[1363.74s -> 1381.30s]  I'm going to give it a solid bite.
[1382.30s -> 1383.54s]  It's not even close to the McChicken.
[1390.93s -> 1391.93s]  Not even close.
[1393.94s -> 1399.18s]  The outside has this weird texture to it where it's like they tried to make it crispy, like a pretend crispy.
[1400.18s -> 1408.39s]  It just kind of tastes like you're chewing on bread crumbs.
[1410.85s -> 1411.85s]  No, McChicken is 10 times better.
[1421.09s -> 1422.09s]  Nice try though.
[1423.09s -> 1424.09s]  Nice try Burger King.
[1439.79s -> 1444.55s]  Nice try, not even close.
[1445.55s -> 1447.11s]  The King is in chat.
[1452.13s -> 1456.12s]  You got King, whatever, clown in chat.
[1457.12s -> 1458.87s]  No, it's just not as good.
[1459.87s -> 1460.87s]  All right, I have to give points.
[1461.87s -> 1470.84s]  If we're going to be real here, these, these are, these, if they're fresh and they're hot and they just came out, these are better than McDonald's.
[1474.32s -> 1475.32s]  I have to be honest.
[1480.46s -> 1481.46s]  But almost everything else.
[1482.46s -> 1483.46s]  And I mean Burger King has onion rings.
[1484.46s -> 1487.15s]  And you get an onion ring treasure, that's a big deal.
[1489.61s -> 1494.88s]  But I, I don't want to, oh, it's here.
[1495.88s -> 1497.88s]  I suppose I play with it for a little while.
[1498.88s -> 1499.88s]  Hey everybody, how are you doing?
[1499.88s -> 1502.88s]  This sounds like I have the filter turned on, but I don't.
[1503.88s -> 1504.88s]  This is just me normally talking and there's something really wrong.
[1505.88s -> 1510.21s]  Start talking, Morty, Morty, Morty, Morty, Morty, Morty.
[1511.21s -> 1512.21s]  We got an adventure to go on, Morty.
[1529.00s -> 1531.90s]  Nobody, nobody heard that.
[1538.71s -> 1539.71s]  I almost puked though.
[1541.02s -> 1542.02s]  I'm so glad I got out of the way and stopped when I did.
[1543.02s -> 1544.38s]  I almost fucking puked on stream.
[1545.38s -> 1548.38s]  Just like, not because the food was bad, but because I was choking.
[1549.38s -> 1556.70s]  I can't read chat when I eat.
[1557.70s -> 1558.70s]  You guys just fucking do it to me.
[1558.70s -> 1568.07s]  12.4k people here watching you do this.
[1569.07s -> 1575.24s]  What?
[1576.24s -> 1577.24s]  Yeah, that's fine, right?
[1581.55s -> 1582.55s]  More than 12,000 people here watching this.
[1583.55s -> 1584.55s]  But this wouldn't happen every day.
[1585.55s -> 1588.92s]  If I just ate like McDonald's and Burger King and Wendy's every day on stream,
[1589.92s -> 1590.92s]  do you think you'd really stick around for that long?
[1591.92s -> 1592.92s]  Would you really stick around for that long?
[1593.92s -> 1598.30s]  You, yeah, you say you would, but in a week, half of you guys just be like,
[1599.30s -> 1600.30s]  this is fucking, she keeps doing this.
[1601.30s -> 1602.30s]  I'm done. I'm out of here.
[1603.30s -> 1610.74s]  I would watch you more.
[1611.74s -> 1612.74s]  You say that, but like in two months,
[1613.74s -> 1614.74s]  I'd be eating like the 30th McChicken on stream.
[1615.74s -> 1617.92s]  You'd be like, all right, I'm going to find somebody else to watch.
[1618.92s -> 1622.02s]  He keeps doing this.
[1623.02s -> 1625.54s]  And by the way, these are too big.
[1629.59s -> 1630.59s]  Like these are huge.
[1632.66s -> 1633.66s]  Where do you put these?
[1634.66s -> 1639.17s]  I mean, I like it, but these are too big.
[1644.50s -> 1645.50s]  You mean small.
[1646.74s -> 1647.74s]  How much liquid is actually inside of here?
[1649.50s -> 1650.50s]  This is a large Coke.
[1657.18s -> 1659.44s]  I feel like the two liter bottle is in here.
[1660.44s -> 1662.70s]  Okay.
[1663.70s -> 1665.78s]  Final review.
[1667.27s -> 1668.27s]  The Burger King Whopper is going to get out of 10.
[1668.27s -> 1680.71s]  It's somewhere in the sixes.
[1684.77s -> 1688.58s]  It's like 6.4.
[1689.82s -> 1690.82s]  Yeah, 6.4.
[1694.11s -> 1695.99s]  I think so.
[1696.99s -> 1699.99s]  A quarter pounder is honestly, a quarter pounder is not very much better, but it is.
[1700.99s -> 1701.99s]  But it is, but I know it is.
[1702.99s -> 1703.99s]  I would give a quarter pounder like a seven and an eight.
[1704.99s -> 1709.75s]  7.8 for a quarter pounder.
[1710.75s -> 1715.77s]  I just like McDonald's better.
[1716.77s -> 1718.90s]  Arbitrary numbers.
[1721.17s -> 1722.60s]  Okay, so something's in here.
[1723.60s -> 1724.60s]  I can like feel it like blocking my nasal passage.
[1724.60s -> 1733.74s]  I'm going to like go into the sink and go, and like a fucking french fry is going to come up.
[1734.74s -> 1739.50s]  It's a worm.
[1740.50s -> 1741.50s]  It's not a fucking worm.
[1743.70s -> 1744.70s]  What about Chuck E. Cheese?
[1746.71s -> 1747.71s]  But that's pizza.
[1750.62s -> 1751.62s]  They don't have burgers at Chuck E. Cheese, do they?
[1752.62s -> 1755.78s]  Move out of the way for Otto.
[1763.42s -> 1764.42s]  All right, let me clean this up.
[1765.78s -> 1766.78s]  I've eaten.
[1773.85s -> 1774.85s]  That was the, oh my God.
[1775.85s -> 1777.02s]  The Burger King McChicken gets five.
[1778.02s -> 1783.42s]  I don't like it.
[1784.42s -> 1785.42s]  I can't believe I almost puked on stream.
[1786.42s -> 1787.42s]  There's no way I will like puke on stream.
[1788.42s -> 1789.42s]  No way.
[1794.38s -> 1796.06s]  It was really close.
[1797.06s -> 1798.06s]  All right, I'll be right back.
[1800.71s -> 1801.71s]  All right, let me clean up.
[1802.71s -> 1803.71s]  Best puke of 2021.
[1807.45s -> 1808.45s]  Well, it'll be the only puke of 2021.
[1809.45s -> 1810.45s]  All right, I'll be right back.
[1811.45s -> 1812.45s]  We're going to go back to that little console.
[1813.45s -> 1825.10s]  Figure that was the best thing to do today.
[1826.10s -> 1956.56s]  So I'll be right back.
[1957.56s -> 1958.56s]  We'll get started.
[1959.56s -> 1963.87s]  See you in a bit.
[1964.87s -> 1965.87s]  Oh my God, that was fucking ridiculous.
[1966.87s -> 1970.61s]  I just blew out so much like junk.
[1971.61s -> 1976.56s]  We heard it.
[1977.56s -> 1978.56s]  Now I'm fine.
[1979.56s -> 1981.12s]  Oh, pog, pog moment.
[1982.12s -> 1985.12s]  A little piece of like weird lettuce on the counter.
[1986.74s -> 1987.74s]  Oh, nice.
[1993.91s -> 1994.91s]  All right, let's play this little thing.
[2002.49s -> 2003.49s]  Wait, is there a link already?
[2004.73s -> 2005.73s]  What's the, there's a link already.
[2008.57s -> 2010.57s]  No, you can't do the Kubrick stare again.
[2011.57s -> 2012.57s]  With the hamburger.
[2014.77s -> 2022.86s]  I guess you could.
[2024.74s -> 2025.74s]  Oh my God.
[2027.81s -> 2031.48s]  Let's take a look.
[2031.48s -> 2032.48s]  Oh boy.
[2038.33s -> 2039.33s]  That is so creepy.
[2040.50s -> 2041.50s]  That is scary.
[2049.38s -> 2056.78s]  I need to like cough because like anytime something goes up your nose and down the wrong pipe and just through your nose and shit like, hold on.
[2057.78s -> 2082.50s]  Oops.
[2082.50s -> 2083.50s]  Sorry, I didn't mean to do that.
[2084.50s -> 2086.50s]  Oh, I'm so glad I got to do that though.
[2087.50s -> 2090.96s]  Oh, all right, let's go.
[2092.84s -> 2093.84s]  We still have hundreds of games that I haven't played.
[2094.84s -> 2095.84s]  Probably not going to do this again, by the way.
[2099.19s -> 2100.19s]  This will be the last time you see this console.
[2103.86s -> 2104.86s]  He's taking a rip.
[2106.42s -> 2114.89s]  Now, really important, I need to delay the audio by a certain amount of time.
[2115.89s -> 2116.89s]  You can test it for me to make sure it's working.
[2121.97s -> 2123.97s]  Okay, so let's give you, let's give us a little test here.
[2124.97s -> 2127.45s]  So ready, one, two, one, two, three, four.
[2128.45s -> 2134.09s]  How are we doing?
[2135.09s -> 2136.09s]  One, two, three, four, five.
[2137.09s -> 2138.09s]  One, two, three, four.
[2140.35s -> 2141.66s]  Okay, all right, let's go.
[2142.96s -> 2143.96s]  Let's play.
[2146.54s -> 2147.91s]  Where do we start?
[2153.76s -> 2156.60s]  Where do we start today?
[2157.60s -> 2160.74s]  Jungle Book, licensed by Nintendo.
[2160.74s -> 2164.67s]  Probably not.
[2165.67s -> 2166.67s]  Okay, Walt Disney Company.
[2167.67s -> 2168.85s]  Press select for options.
[2169.85s -> 2172.37s]  This is, I think this is just the game.
[2173.37s -> 2174.37s]  Jungle, okay.
[2177.53s -> 2178.90s]  Version, get ready.
[2181.80s -> 2183.62s]  Where, oh, is there a slide?
[2189.27s -> 2190.27s]  Is this just the game?
[2194.20s -> 2195.20s]  This is not bad.
[2196.38s -> 2197.38s]  Purple, purple background, purple grapes.
[2200.09s -> 2202.09s]  I thought I just bounced on like a spring.
[2204.67s -> 2210.33s]  All down.
[2211.33s -> 2212.33s]  He loves it.
[2213.33s -> 2214.50s]  It's not bad.
[2214.50s -> 2217.38s]  Isn't the warthog, isn't the warthog my friend?
[2218.38s -> 2220.52s]  Wait, this is a different movie.
[2227.20s -> 2228.20s]  How do I get that?
[2234.69s -> 2235.69s]  What the fuck?
[2236.69s -> 2237.69s]  Bear necessities, those simple bear necessities.
[2238.69s -> 2241.69s]  We'll have a lot of fun when we are friends.
[2243.76s -> 2245.06s]  I'm done.
[2246.06s -> 2252.74s]  I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[2264.10s -> 2265.10s]  How do I do this?
[2266.40s -> 2267.40s]  Do we just hold the jump?
[2270.24s -> 2275.51s]  Climb the vine.
[2278.54s -> 2279.54s]  Where?
[2280.54s -> 2281.54s]  This vine.
[2281.54s -> 2282.54s]  This is like dancing.
[2288.97s -> 2289.97s]  I can't get up there.
[2293.06s -> 2297.44s]  Go left?
[2298.44s -> 2299.44s]  I feel like I'm playing this on a Game Boy Color.
[2300.44s -> 2301.44s]  Is this a Game Boy game or is this a Nintendo game?
[2305.88s -> 2306.88s]  Oh, wait.
[2307.88s -> 2308.88s]  Okay, hold on.
[2312.49s -> 2313.49s]  I can hold, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2317.22s -> 2318.91s]  That's, you can run.
[2321.69s -> 2323.57s]  Here we go.
[2324.57s -> 2325.57s]  Bounce, okay, snake.
[2327.90s -> 2328.90s]  Where can I go from here?
[2330.71s -> 2335.54s]  Get the diamond.
[2337.93s -> 2338.93s]  Time's up, it's not up.
[2341.51s -> 2342.51s]  Holy shit, I got it.
[2344.39s -> 2345.39s]  Yeah, time has a bit extended.
[2346.39s -> 2349.30s]  You can jump on people too.
[2350.30s -> 2351.30s]  Do they have Aladdin on here for Super Nintendo?
[2352.30s -> 2353.30s]  Even though it's not the right console?
[2354.30s -> 2357.37s]  And yep, the Super Nintendo Aladdin is better than the Genesis Aladdin.
[2358.37s -> 2361.08s]  I'm done.
[2368.14s -> 2369.14s]  All right, what else we got?
[2370.14s -> 2371.14s]  We did all these, these are all done.
[2372.14s -> 2373.14s]  We got Ninja Turtles 1, Ninja Turtles 2, Ninja Turtles 1.
[2377.78s -> 2378.78s]  The SNES sound card sucks.
[2379.78s -> 2381.78s]  That's a fake comment, it's a troll.
[2383.34s -> 2384.34s]  This is just the game.
[2385.34s -> 2390.37s]  This is just, yeah, this is just the Ninja Turtles game for a regular Nintendo.
[2391.37s -> 2394.91s]  I remember this.
[2399.56s -> 2401.12s]  You actually do get games in this.
[2402.12s -> 2403.12s]  Yeah, this is just the Ninja Turtles game.
[2404.12s -> 2408.79s]  I remember this game being hard as shit when I was younger.
[2409.79s -> 2416.92s]  You suck at it.
[2417.92s -> 2421.98s]  Yeah, whatever.
[2422.98s -> 2427.86s]  Okay, this game's ass.
[2430.26s -> 2431.26s]  It's got great music though.
[2432.26s -> 2433.94s]  I love the overworld music, it's the best.
[2434.94s -> 2440.73s]  Oh yeah, that's right, the swimming level.
[2441.73s -> 2442.73s]  I forgot about the swimming level.
[2442.73s -> 2444.73s]  Dun dun dun, dun dun dun dun.
[2445.73s -> 2447.73s]  Dun dun, dun dun dun, dun dun dun dun.
[2449.03s -> 2454.37s]  Oh, get back up.
[2457.14s -> 2458.14s]  I gotta go up that way, across that way.
[2460.22s -> 2461.22s]  I gotta eat the pizza.
[2462.22s -> 2463.22s]  Yeah, this full pizza, this slices pizza.
[2464.22s -> 2465.22s]  If somebody dies, don't you play as the other characters do?
[2466.22s -> 2472.51s]  It's wicked cool.
[2474.20s -> 2477.59s]  Oh, there we go, here's Bebop and Rocksteady.
[2484.72s -> 2485.72s]  It's Flinter down there.
[2490.03s -> 2492.03s]  That image is Flinter, that is a great Steam profile picture.
[2496.98s -> 2497.98s]  Michelangelo's my favorite.
[2499.29s -> 2500.29s]  He was the funny one.
[2503.70s -> 2505.70s]  I like him the most because he has the lowest vocabulary.
[2512.58s -> 2517.58s]  And he has the incredibly good talent of being able to use nunchucks without accidentally hitting himself on the balls like I have done a hundred times.
[2527.07s -> 2528.07s]  He has the lowest IQ.
[2529.07s -> 2532.02s]  Hey, give us back April.
[2536.65s -> 2537.65s]  Where should I go?
[2541.51s -> 2543.51s]  You know, when I was younger, I don't know why, I thought this was his tongue.
[2544.51s -> 2548.61s]  I thought he was going like a snake.
[2549.61s -> 2552.77s]  Oh, let's go in here.
[2553.77s -> 2559.10s]  What are the two now?
[2560.10s -> 2561.10s]  Alright, this one, okay here we go.
[2561.10s -> 2570.30s]  I see why you relate to him now.
[2571.30s -> 2576.96s]  Why?
[2582.49s -> 2583.49s]  Don't kill me, I'll kill you first.
[2586.78s -> 2587.78s]  Nobody said that? Yes, they did.
[2588.78s -> 2589.78s]  Why would I have read that? Alright, don't die.
[2590.78s -> 2591.78s]  Well, who cares if I die?
[2593.46s -> 2594.46s]  Alright, now I'm going to see what Ninja Turtles 2 is.
[2597.82s -> 2599.12s]  Why does he read chat?
[2600.12s -> 2601.55s]  Why wouldn't I?
[2602.55s -> 2604.43s]  Alright, this is Ninja Turtles 2.
[2605.43s -> 2606.43s]  Ultra games is...
[2607.43s -> 2609.50s]  Wait, what?
[2611.13s -> 2613.13s]  No way, no way, this is like the best game ever made.
[2614.13s -> 2615.13s]  This game is incredible.
[2616.13s -> 2617.13s]  The arcade version?
[2619.46s -> 2620.46s]  Holy shit, are you serious?
[2625.02s -> 2626.78s]  It is.
[2627.78s -> 2634.14s]  This game is awesome.
[2635.14s -> 2636.14s]  Yeah, that's right.
[2638.40s -> 2639.40s]  Okay, I'm going to play the hell out of this.
[2641.98s -> 2642.98s]  Holy shit.
[2643.98s -> 2647.27s]  Forget everything else I planned on doing today.
[2648.27s -> 2649.27s]  I at least want to get to the first boss.
[2654.42s -> 2655.42s]  I love this game.
[2657.36s -> 2658.36s]  I used to play this all the time.
[2659.36s -> 2660.36s]  We have this arcade game on my college campus.
[2661.36s -> 2669.96s]  That sounds like a pretty awesome college campus to me.
[2670.96s -> 2671.96s]  Turtles in Time?
[2672.96s -> 2673.96s]  I have beaten Turtles in Time.
[2674.96s -> 2676.96s]  I've probably completed that game one to two hundred times.
[2677.96s -> 2685.15s]  That game is so good.
[2686.15s -> 2688.22s]  Liar?
[2689.22s -> 2690.22s]  No, I'm not lying, no I'm not.
[2691.22s -> 2692.22s]  Friends and I used to sit there, we would rent it.
[2693.53s -> 2695.53s]  And we would beat the game like five or six times a day.
[2696.53s -> 2698.53s]  Until we were forced to return it to Blockbuster.
[2709.05s -> 2710.05s]  Okay, so one to two hundred times.
[2711.05s -> 2712.99s]  Yeah, yes.
[2713.99s -> 2714.99s]  Very much yes.
[2717.19s -> 2721.18s]  Is this a Pizza Hut?
[2722.18s -> 2723.18s]  So you beat it two times.
[2724.18s -> 2729.52s]  No, two hundred!
[2729.52s -> 2733.52s]  My favorite part about these old beat-em-up games, especially the Ninja Turtle games,
[2734.52s -> 2736.52s]  is when they were blinking that means they were almost dead.
[2737.52s -> 2738.52s]  I think we did that back.
[2739.52s -> 2743.68s]  Back before health bars were over every enemy,
[2744.68s -> 2745.68s]  when they started blinking it means they were close.
[2746.68s -> 2748.86s]  They should start doing that with wow raid bosses and shit.
[2749.86s -> 2751.86s]  Get these health bars with like ten million HP on them.
[2752.86s -> 2754.22s]  No.
[2755.22s -> 2758.19s]  Is he blinking?
[2759.19s -> 2760.19s]  He's blinking, he's almost done.
[2761.19s -> 2769.92s]  Up to DPS, let's go.
[2776.86s -> 2777.86s]  Oh, come on, don't die.
[2778.86s -> 2779.86s]  Look, it's an arcade version.
[2780.86s -> 2782.74s]  I'm supposed to have like three people here.
[2783.74s -> 2784.74s]  I love the X-Men arcade game too.
[2785.74s -> 2786.74s]  And I know I've done the Colossus like a thousand times,
[2787.74s -> 2788.74s]  but every time I bring it up I'm going to do the Colossus sound.
[2789.74s -> 2798.02s]  You know that, right?
[2802.71s -> 2803.71s]  Shit, worst noise incoming.
[2804.71s -> 2805.71s]  No, that's not.
[2806.71s -> 2807.71s]  Listen to this.
[2808.89s -> 2812.32s]  You cannot nominate something or an award if it's been done a bunch of times before
[2813.32s -> 2814.32s]  and you didn't nominate it before.
[2815.32s -> 2816.32s]  Like years ago you had a chance to nominate this.
[2816.32s -> 2817.32s]  It was never on the nomination list.
[2828.54s -> 2829.54s]  Can't nominate it.
[2830.54s -> 2843.62s]  I've done it like a thousand times.
[2844.62s -> 2845.62s]  Sorting algorithm.
[2846.62s -> 2847.62s]  Who's the first boss?
[2848.62s -> 2849.62s]  It's the Blob in this X-Men game.
[2850.99s -> 2851.99s]  It actually is the Blob in the X-Men game.
[2857.20s -> 2858.63s]  Swallow your spit.
[2859.63s -> 2867.02s]  What?
[2870.20s -> 2871.20s]  Why did I read that?
[2872.20s -> 2873.20s]  I don't know.
[2876.62s -> 2877.62s]  Here comes the Blob.
[2877.62s -> 2878.62s]  The Blob.
[2879.62s -> 2880.62s]  You can start hitting him before we stop talking.
[2881.62s -> 2883.11s]  Nothing can stop the Blob.
[2898.77s -> 2899.77s]  Who is it?
[2900.77s -> 2901.77s]  Is it Bebop and Rocksteady or is that later?
[2906.98s -> 2907.98s]  Get over here, you little shit.
[2909.79s -> 2912.70s]  It is.
[2916.56s -> 2918.56s]  Am I getting infinite continues on like the bootleg Nintendo?
[2919.56s -> 2925.66s]  These are flamethrower troops.
[2926.66s -> 2932.51s]  There we go.
[2934.20s -> 2937.94s]  I forget who it is.
[2938.94s -> 2945.81s]  It's Bebop.
[2946.81s -> 2947.81s]  Oh, I love it.
[2947.81s -> 2948.81s]  I love that sound.
[2954.53s -> 2956.53s]  Excuse me, can I get a he's blinking alert when he starts blinking?
[2957.53s -> 2958.53s]  I'm going to need some help here.
[2959.96s -> 2960.96s]  Sorry.
[2976.02s -> 2977.02s]  Here it is.
[2987.93s -> 2994.10s]  He's blinking.
[2995.10s -> 2996.10s]  Don't let him win.
[3003.99s -> 3006.90s]  Up the DPS quick.
[3010.89s -> 3011.89s]  That's from Turtles in Time.
[3016.90s -> 3017.90s]  Turtles in Time had the best music too.
[3023.56s -> 3024.56s]  At first level in Turtles in Time.
[3027.08s -> 3028.08s]  Big Apple.
[3029.08s -> 3030.08s]  It's the best.
[3036.18s -> 3037.18s]  Back when video game music was good.
[3038.18s -> 3039.18s]  Back when OSTs were good.
[3040.18s -> 3041.49s]  And there was passion in them.
[3050.41s -> 3052.41s]  Sing the entire Ninja Turtles theme song perfectly.
[3054.61s -> 3058.09s]  What?
[3059.09s -> 3060.09s]  I don't think they're on national television doing this.
[3061.09s -> 3065.08s]  He's like camera shy.
[3067.15s -> 3069.15s]  April O'Neil was just on there going, help, help.
[3070.15s -> 3071.15s]  And then it cuts to him.
[3072.15s -> 3073.15s]  It's like, Shredder, you're on.
[3074.15s -> 3076.15s]  There's this camera guy pointing at him going, Shredder, you're pointing.
[3077.15s -> 3078.15s]  Come on.
[3079.15s -> 3080.84s]  He's just frozen.
[3087.39s -> 3088.39s]  So nervous.
[3089.39s -> 3090.39s]  You're all doomed to die.
[3091.39s -> 3092.39s]  So you're going to get killed.
[3093.39s -> 3094.39s]  Okay, cut it.
[3095.70s -> 3097.70s]  His face is starting to get bright fucking red.
[3099.58s -> 3101.58s]  He had this elaborate thing he practiced in the mirror for like three days straight.
[3102.58s -> 3103.58s]  And it did not sound like that.
[3104.58s -> 3105.58s]  It was way cooler.
[3110.08s -> 3111.08s]  And then he like ran off.
[3112.08s -> 3113.08s]  He like runs off backstage with his hands in his face going like.
[3114.08s -> 3132.53s]  You're projecting.
[3137.67s -> 3138.67s]  What?
[3139.67s -> 3141.85s]  You think I've never, when I was like younger, got all the lines I was going to do.
[3142.85s -> 3143.85s]  Like an old school play.
[3146.05s -> 3151.05s]  Those of you that have never had the experience of being on like a stage in a school play and forgetting your lines.
[3152.05s -> 3156.42s]  While just silence surrounds you and all the other kids on stage.
[3157.42s -> 3159.85s]  Are looking around and staring at you.
[3160.85s -> 3165.02s]  Like, oh God, you are ruining the entire play.
[3166.02s -> 3167.46s]  Dude.
[3168.46s -> 3169.46s]  And you're sitting there like.
[3170.46s -> 3172.46s]  I don't know.
[3173.46s -> 3176.04s]  I never cried and ran off stage though.
[3177.04s -> 3178.60s]  I did forget.
[3181.12s -> 3184.12s]  And then when you fuck up and you start saying a line that's wrong.
[3185.12s -> 3187.55s]  Guys, here's something you need to know about drama.
[3188.55s -> 3189.55s]  About theater.
[3190.55s -> 3191.55s]  Back in like middle school.
[3192.55s -> 3194.55s]  We all of us just memorized the last person's last sentence.
[3195.55s -> 3196.55s]  To cue us for our sentence.
[3197.55s -> 3201.55s]  So if you do not give me the exact sentence that I've memorized.
[3202.55s -> 3204.86s]  I am not going to be able to remember anything I'm supposed to say.
[3205.86s -> 3208.16s]  It's an incredibly fragile chain of events.
[3208.16s -> 3211.59s]  Where we all have to memorize the last thing that the last person said.
[3212.59s -> 3216.41s]  And it's an extremely volatile environment.
[3217.41s -> 3218.41s]  Because if one person doesn't fucking remember.
[3219.41s -> 3220.41s]  Everyone doesn't remember.
[3221.41s -> 3227.10s]  And then the curtain has to close and you skip a whole scene.
[3228.10s -> 3230.73s]  And then the audience just starts going like.
[3231.73s -> 3233.86s]  Clap.
[3235.68s -> 3237.68s]  And here we are at the next scene.
[3238.68s -> 3246.90s]  It's all everybody's parents.
[3247.90s -> 3255.06s]  I can still feel that sauce.
[3255.06s -> 3271.81s]  Oh we're living the olden days.
[3272.81s -> 3277.31s]  Get off.
[3278.55s -> 3283.31s]  I want to see the next boss.
[3284.31s -> 3285.31s]  Wait I remember this is the Robo Turtle right?
[3286.31s -> 3287.31s]  Because they remade it for Turtles in Time.
[3288.74s -> 3289.74s]  I believe that's who it is.
[3296.10s -> 3297.10s]  What's up with the lore with the Robo Turtle?
[3298.10s -> 3299.10s]  He was bad right?
[3300.10s -> 3301.10s]  And then Donatello like reprogrammed him and made him a good guy.
[3302.10s -> 3304.10s]  And then after he was bad he turned into a good turtle right?
[3305.10s -> 3306.98s]  Oh no wrong.
[3311.94s -> 3312.94s]  I lose.
[3314.18s -> 3315.18s]  That happens right?
[3315.18s -> 3319.36s]  That's a fake fan.
[3321.05s -> 3322.05s]  Oh I got continues we're good.
[3323.05s -> 3324.05s]  No I don't want to do that again.
[3328.94s -> 3329.94s]  I love this game though.
[3330.94s -> 3333.78s]  Acting challenge.
[3336.23s -> 3337.23s]  Raphael eating a sloppy burger.
[3339.43s -> 3340.43s]  I already did it.
[3341.43s -> 3342.43s]  Raphael has like a New York accent.
[3343.43s -> 3344.43s]  I'm from Boston close enough.
[3346.70s -> 3347.70s]  And I just ate a gross cold whopper.
[3348.70s -> 3349.70s]  And I think I was like oh what the fuck dude.
[3350.70s -> 3356.03s]  I just did that.
[3357.03s -> 3364.78s]  Where's Ninja Turtles 3?
[3368.90s -> 3369.90s]  There it is.
[3370.90s -> 3375.34s]  Which one is this?
[3376.34s -> 3378.34s]  Turtles Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[3379.34s -> 3380.34s]  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
[3381.34s -> 3382.34s]  Heroes in a half shell.
[3383.58s -> 3384.58s]  Turtle power.
[3385.58s -> 3387.58s]  They're the world's most fearsome fighting team.
[3388.58s -> 3389.58s]  Close enough.
[3395.62s -> 3396.62s]  I like all the turtles.
[3397.62s -> 3398.62s]  I love them all.
[3399.93s -> 3400.93s]  Michelangelo is my favorite.
[3401.93s -> 3402.93s]  But I'm not against playing as Raphael either.
[3407.56s -> 3410.56s]  The turtles are enjoying their vacation on a beach.
[3411.56s -> 3412.56s]  In Florida.
[3414.82s -> 3415.82s]  When suddenly.
[3420.07s -> 3421.07s]  Turtles report is just about to start.
[3422.07s -> 3423.07s]  Is that a glass of wine?
[3426.42s -> 3428.42s]  Here in New York crime is escalating every day.
[3429.86s -> 3430.86s]  We went on vacation?
[3433.31s -> 3438.07s]  Gee what happened?
[3439.07s -> 3440.07s]  Bummer dudes.
[3443.36s -> 3444.36s]  It's me Shredder.
[3445.36s -> 3446.36s]  I'm stealing all of New York City.
[3447.36s -> 3449.30s]  The whole thing.
[3450.30s -> 3451.48s]  What?
[3452.48s -> 3453.48s]  Wouldn't we know that was?
[3454.48s -> 3456.30s]  Turtles I'm taking April along with Manhattan Island.
[3457.86s -> 3459.86s]  If you want them back come and get them.
[3459.86s -> 3466.89s]  I love how Manhattan Island is like tacked on to I'm taking April again.
[3468.70s -> 3469.70s]  Yes I'm taking April.
[3470.70s -> 3473.70s]  And the entire all of New York City too I guess.
[3474.70s -> 3487.14s]  But I got April.
[3488.14s -> 3492.71s]  I don't remember this game.
[3493.71s -> 3496.94s]  He took it all.
[3500.86s -> 3501.86s]  How?
[3502.86s -> 3503.86s]  Is Shredder kind of like a reverse Batman?
[3506.06s -> 3507.06s]  Is he like a trillionaire or something?
[3508.06s -> 3509.06s]  I feel like he kind of has to be.
[3510.06s -> 3511.06s]  He always has to do like experiments and has like all these new things made.
[3512.06s -> 3518.55s]  And tons of money going into stuff.
[3519.55s -> 3529.72s]  Like the Joker laughs and like has a gun that has a fake pow on it.
[3532.05s -> 3533.05s]  And like tries to stab people.
[3534.80s -> 3535.80s]  And he has all this control.
[3536.80s -> 3539.80s]  Yet the Shredder has a whole research facility dedicated to creating like new animals.
[3540.80s -> 3547.92s]  Shredder is probably like one of those powerful villains I think in all of like comic books and stuff.
[3548.92s -> 3555.41s]  Isn't he? He has to be.
[3556.41s -> 3557.41s]  Who is more powerful than the Shredder?
[3558.41s -> 3560.41s]  In regards to like how much money they have and how much like stuff that they've developed.
[3561.97s -> 3562.97s]  This motherfucker made a Death Star.
[3563.97s -> 3564.97s]  Shredder made a Death Star.
[3565.97s -> 3566.97s]  The Technodrome.
[3579.09s -> 3581.09s]  Yeah and okay in the grand scheme of things okay like Bowser.
[3582.90s -> 3588.59s]  Mario I'm going to take Princess Peach on my flying pirate ship.
[3590.02s -> 3592.02s]  And I have a bunch of little shit kids.
[3594.22s -> 3595.22s]  Ah I'm so powerful.
[3596.22s -> 3597.22s]  No you're just a fucking weird uncle.
[3599.81s -> 3605.98s]  The Shredder has like fucking laser beams in a research facility and thousands and thousands and thousands of projects.
[3606.98s -> 3607.98s]  And hundreds of billions of dollars worth of shit.
[3608.98s -> 3616.56s]  Bowser has an army.
[3616.56s -> 3617.56s]  Shredder has an army.
[3618.56s -> 3619.56s]  Yeah of little like Goomba people.
[3620.56s -> 3624.18s]  When you step on their heads they die instantly.
[3628.05s -> 3630.05s]  Look at these guys. These guys are like trained professional ninjas.
[3631.05s -> 3637.31s]  Are you telling me that these guys are less powerful than a Goomba and like a Koopa?
[3638.31s -> 3648.32s]  Goombas wouldn't be able to pull that off.
[3649.32s -> 3657.30s]  People turn into...wait what?
[3659.88s -> 3660.88s]  Shredder is Dr. Doom.
[3664.55s -> 3665.55s]  Shredder is just Dr. Doom.
[3667.88s -> 3668.88s]  No that's not accurate.
[3668.88s -> 3669.88s]  Shredder is incredibly powerful.
[3670.88s -> 3671.88s]  Like he's got like skills like fighting skills.
[3672.88s -> 3677.70s]  Dr. Doom just like injected syrup into like his fucking butt cheek or something right?
[3678.70s -> 3681.87s]  He's not a trained like martial artist like Shredder is.
[3682.87s -> 3690.04s]  I think the Shred...you put Shredder against Dr. Doom Shredder wins every time.
[3691.04s -> 3706.10s]  Wrong.
[3707.10s -> 3708.10s]  Gonna have to settle this in the next rumble.
[3709.10s -> 3710.10s]  Shredder.
[3713.39s -> 3714.39s]  Incorrect.
[3715.39s -> 3716.39s]  I think Shredder is one of the most powerful villains.
[3717.39s -> 3718.39s]  He just has everything.
[3718.39s -> 3728.76s]  He's got the...okay he's got like the Wolverine claws.
[3729.76s -> 3733.38s]  He's arguably potentially even more trained than Wolverine was.
[3734.38s -> 3750.77s]  Somebody said NA aim.
[3751.77s -> 3752.77s]  He's just aiming into the sky.
[3753.77s -> 3760.08s]  He gets beaten by four super mutant turtles.
[3761.08s -> 3764.50s]  Yeah at the same time.
[3765.50s -> 3777.71s]  When have the...I'm sorry has there ever been a scenario where the Shredder fights Leonardo by himself and loses?
[3778.71s -> 3781.71s]  That's not happened. They're all ganging up on him together at the same time and they beat him.
[3781.71s -> 3782.71s]  In the comics yeah.
[3788.69s -> 3789.69s]  Yeah he probably was already injured though. He was already injured.
[3790.69s -> 3796.78s]  Raphael like shot him in the chest with a crossbow and like Leonardo fought him one on one.
[3797.78s -> 3810.29s]  Not fair.
[3811.29s -> 3812.29s]  I keep jumping into this fucking fire.
[3813.29s -> 3819.33s]  He's coping.
[3820.33s -> 3824.83s]  Shredder whatever.
[3825.83s -> 3827.07s]  Shredder Stan.
[3830.55s -> 3832.55s]  How did you do this this quickly? Holy shit.
[3833.55s -> 3834.86s]  This was fast.
[3835.86s -> 3837.10s]  Very fast.
[3847.30s -> 3849.62s]  That's good shit.
[3857.52s -> 3858.52s]  If you like Shredder so much why don't you marry him?
[3860.08s -> 3861.08s]  He's already taken.
[3872.50s -> 3873.50s]  I don't know man.
[3874.50s -> 3876.50s]  I would love if there was a Shredder and like a Shredette.
[3878.12s -> 3879.12s]  Oh yeah that would be fucking awesome.
[3880.12s -> 3881.49s]  I would love that. Include it.
[3882.49s -> 3892.24s]  I want it.
[3893.24s -> 3894.24s]  What the fuck. Look at that synchronized move.
[3895.24s -> 3896.24s]  Oh the Goombas can do this Jeremy.
[3897.24s -> 3898.24s]  Oh yeah they could.
[3899.24s -> 3900.24s]  They could do this.
[3902.06s -> 3903.06s]  Yeah.
[3904.06s -> 3905.06s]  There are only two species on earth that can do that.
[3906.06s -> 3907.49s]  The Foot Clan and birds.
[3908.49s -> 3909.49s]  And some birds can't even do that.
[3909.49s -> 3910.49s]  You lost that argument.
[3919.28s -> 3920.28s]  This is going so slow.
[3921.28s -> 3922.71s]  This is lagging so hard I can't even.
[3927.15s -> 3928.15s]  About dolphins.
[3929.15s -> 3946.58s]  Let's be honest though dolphins are pretty much just birds under the water.
[3947.89s -> 3949.06s]  Yeah.
[3950.06s -> 3951.75s]  Everyone think I'm crazy. Why don't you look it up.
[3952.75s -> 3953.75s]  Go ahead. Look it up.
[3954.75s -> 3955.75s]  Are dolphins the birds of the ocean?
[3956.75s -> 3957.75s]  Sure. Jerma is the crazy one right?
[3967.50s -> 3968.50s]  Did you go to Shredder's wedding?
[3971.09s -> 3972.78s]  I was in the wedding.
[3973.78s -> 3974.78s]  I was in the wedding party.
[3984.08s -> 3986.08s]  You guys think that like 40 years from now.
[3986.08s -> 3989.08s]  You think like the Ninja Turtles would be at Shredder's like son's wedding.
[3990.08s -> 3991.08s]  Or daughter's wedding or something.
[3992.08s -> 3993.08s]  And they look good old and wrinkly and shit.
[3994.08s -> 3995.08s]  Clapping and just in the audience.
[3996.08s -> 3999.37s]  I think so.
[4000.37s -> 4007.18s]  Shit.
[4013.60s -> 4015.48s]  They're turtles.
[4016.48s -> 4018.10s]  Yeah turtles live to be like 150.
[4019.10s -> 4028.09s]  You don't think they'll be alive?
[4029.09s -> 4037.24s]  I'm confused.
[4038.24s -> 4046.84s]  Shredder is going to still be in his armor at the wedding.
[4050.51s -> 4051.51s]  Maybe.
[4054.80s -> 4055.80s]  Look at me right in the face.
[4056.80s -> 4063.29s]  I just want to see the next boss and then I'm going to move on.
[4064.29s -> 4068.30s]  Yeah but they had like radioactive goop put on them.
[4069.30s -> 4070.30s]  That probably increases their life by a little bit.
[4071.30s -> 4072.30s]  They have like super powers and they're radioactive.
[4073.30s -> 4075.82s]  Like right.
[4076.82s -> 4078.31s]  They have extra powers.
[4079.31s -> 4088.81s]  The gas lighting.
[4091.33s -> 4092.33s]  Thanks for the tip. Thanks for the help.
[4093.33s -> 4094.33s]  Appreciate it. Thank you.
[4099.73s -> 4100.73s]  Three four five jump.
[4105.30s -> 4106.73s]  Three four five jump.
[4107.73s -> 4108.73s]  One two three four five jump.
[4117.52s -> 4118.52s]  I will say about the.
[4119.52s -> 4121.08s]  I almost said Simpsons.
[4122.08s -> 4123.08s]  The Ninja Turtles really have surprisingly stuck around for a very long time.
[4124.08s -> 4125.08s]  The Ninja Turtles are still cool right.
[4126.77s -> 4127.77s]  To younger kids.
[4128.77s -> 4134.42s]  They still are yeah.
[4136.30s -> 4137.30s]  That's great. That's cool.
[4138.61s -> 4141.61s]  It's cool that something could still be around and not sort of be tired I guess.
[4143.04s -> 4144.04s]  The kids love the Ninja Turtles still.
[4145.04s -> 4146.04s]  25 years later.
[4151.50s -> 4154.60s]  Everyone's saying no.
[4155.60s -> 4156.60s]  Am I just. What do you mean they don't.
[4157.60s -> 4160.50s]  Absolutely not.
[4161.81s -> 4163.37s]  Really.
[4164.37s -> 4165.37s]  They have like a new TV show and a new line of toys and stuff.
[4166.37s -> 4167.37s]  I thought that there was a whole new thing with them.
[4179.49s -> 4180.49s]  Peppa Pig is.
[4181.49s -> 4182.49s]  Two year olds.
[4183.49s -> 4184.49s]  I'm talking about like 10 to 14 year olds.
[4193.22s -> 4194.22s]  A two year old does not watch the Ninja Turtles.
[4195.22s -> 4196.22s]  Maybe like.
[4197.22s -> 4198.22s]  Once you cross like five six seven eight.
[4199.22s -> 4200.22s]  That's probably what I would say like okay you're starting to get interested.
[4201.22s -> 4203.35s]  I don't know who this is.
[4204.35s -> 4207.00s]  What character is this.
[4208.94s -> 4209.94s]  Holy fucking shit.
[4219.95s -> 4225.54s]  Oh God.
[4227.74s -> 4228.74s]  It's Peppa Pig.
[4229.92s -> 4230.92s]  Oh shit.
[4234.66s -> 4236.86s]  Environmental attacks.
[4244.24s -> 4245.61s]  What.
[4246.61s -> 4247.98s]  He still has it.
[4258.82s -> 4262.87s]  Stop.
[4265.71s -> 4267.46s]  Charge.
[4269.54s -> 4271.03s]  Stop.
[4273.10s -> 4281.77s]  Charge.
[4282.77s -> 4299.10s]  It's not blinking yet.
[4300.10s -> 4302.62s]  Stop saying it.
[4303.62s -> 4304.62s]  Two three.
[4305.62s -> 4306.62s]  Watch out.
[4307.62s -> 4308.62s]  Doctor Doom.
[4309.62s -> 4310.62s]  Doctor Doom.
[4314.74s -> 4315.74s]  He's so strong.
[4316.74s -> 4319.38s]  I just dropped my fucking god damn mouse on the ground because of this.
[4320.38s -> 4321.38s]  Hold on.
[4323.52s -> 4325.14s]  What does Doctor Doom do.
[4326.14s -> 4327.96s]  Tell me.
[4328.96s -> 4329.96s]  There's sauce in my nose.
[4331.20s -> 4334.89s]  Doctor Doom owns a country meaning he has significant political power.
[4335.89s -> 4341.32s]  He's got magic powers on top of superhuman strength and has amassed a robot army with a superior intellect.
[4342.32s -> 4347.32s]  All Shredder has is claws and a rent a ninja he hired with ham sandwiches.
[4348.32s -> 4350.32s]  Shredders is a bug to Doctor Doom.
[4353.48s -> 4355.23s]  Okay.
[4356.60s -> 4358.35s]  That's something that.
[4359.35s -> 4361.49s]  What I just fell off.
[4362.49s -> 4365.46s]  It's a bug to Doctor Doom.
[4365.46s -> 4366.46s]  Let me ask you another follow up question though.
[4367.46s -> 4368.46s]  Do you really care.
[4377.50s -> 4378.50s]  Yes I do.
[4380.83s -> 4381.83s]  Well so do I. All right.
[4382.83s -> 4383.83s]  I was trying to pretend like I didn't.
[4384.83s -> 4386.33s]  Doctor Doom has got nothing on this Shredder.
[4400.94s -> 4401.94s]  Oh Doctor Doom do that.
[4402.94s -> 4414.85s]  He said Doctor Doom owns a country or something.
[4415.85s -> 4417.85s]  Can he float the entire country on.
[4419.60s -> 4421.60s]  You said he has magical powers but how is Shredder doing that.
[4428.22s -> 4429.22s]  Probably. I don't think so.
[4435.90s -> 4436.90s]  He has rent a ninjas.
[4439.33s -> 4440.33s]  This is actually kind of brutal.
[4444.45s -> 4459.96s]  Oh shit.
[4460.96s -> 4472.18s]  I knew it was coming.
[4473.18s -> 4479.36s]  My favorite thing about the little Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is how every word throws you a new curve ball like teenage solid starting point.
[4480.36s -> 4481.36s]  Popular protagonist demographic.
[4482.36s -> 4483.36s]  I can understand that.
[4484.36s -> 4485.36s]  Suddenly hard left into mutant and oh shit that's wild.
[4486.36s -> 4487.36s]  We are going to X-Men territory.
[4488.36s -> 4489.36s]  How are they going to play this.
[4490.36s -> 4491.36s]  Let's wait and ninjas.
[4492.36s -> 4493.36s]  Yo this can't possibly get cooler.
[4494.36s -> 4495.36s]  Ninjas are wild right.
[4495.36s -> 4496.36s]  I don't know what to do.
[4505.28s -> 4506.28s]  This crumbs all of my keyboard.
[4508.54s -> 4513.69s]  I have to clean up later.
[4514.69s -> 4515.69s]  It's a Redditor spam.
[4516.69s -> 4517.69s]  I forgot this game is before 1995.
[4525.78s -> 4526.78s]  Doing the special move hurts you.
[4527.78s -> 4528.78s]  But you can do the special move a million times at 0% health.
[4533.98s -> 4535.48s]  Shredditor.
[4536.48s -> 4537.48s]  I knew it was coming.
[4538.48s -> 4539.48s]  I wasn't going to say it.
[4541.94s -> 4543.18s]  He's going to fucking hit by a car.
[4544.18s -> 4547.59s]  Okay that's it.
[4548.59s -> 4551.83s]  And the Ninja Turtles are cooler than Doctor Doom.
[4552.83s -> 4555.54s]  Because we got our own Yoda here.
[4556.54s -> 4557.54s]  Splinter is like a kind of a cool.
[4558.54s -> 4560.54s]  I mean Yoda is cool but Splinter is really cool too.
[4561.78s -> 4562.78s]  The Ninja Turtles.
[4568.70s -> 4569.70s]  Okay you want to play this game.
[4570.70s -> 4575.00s]  Name me the last fantastic four piece of media.
[4576.00s -> 4580.54s]  That had higher than a two across like Metacritic.
[4581.54s -> 4583.49s]  And Rotten Tomatoes and stuff.
[4588.50s -> 4599.41s]  How does that sound.
[4600.41s -> 4601.58s]  I think the Shredder wins.
[4602.58s -> 4603.95s]  What's next.
[4607.88s -> 4608.88s]  What are we going now.
[4608.88s -> 4609.88s]  He's well written.
[4612.46s -> 4613.90s]  He's directed much better.
[4614.90s -> 4615.90s]  He may be acted much better.
[4616.90s -> 4617.90s]  He may be written better than.
[4631.17s -> 4632.17s]  Yeah that's a point.
[4635.65s -> 4640.22s]  Three Eyes Boy.
[4641.22s -> 4642.22s]  Binding of Isaac.
[4652.86s -> 4654.04s]  Was it.
[4660.21s -> 4662.86s]  This one's kind of fun.
[4664.22s -> 4665.22s]  What's Tien.
[4667.30s -> 4668.92s]  Tien.
[4675.28s -> 4676.28s]  I don't know.
[4681.42s -> 4682.42s]  I don't know what Tien is.
[4683.42s -> 4684.42s]  Why am I killing all the neighborhood animals.
[4686.05s -> 4687.05s]  What am I doing.
[4694.56s -> 4696.50s]  One shot.
[4699.09s -> 4700.09s]  Next game.
[4701.39s -> 4702.39s]  Hold on and wait.
[4703.39s -> 4704.39s]  We got to give it at least like a minute or two.
[4705.39s -> 4710.79s]  We can't just leave immediately.
[4711.79s -> 4712.79s]  Why am I doing this.
[4713.79s -> 4716.79s]  I hitched a ride on the back of a truck and just started shooting all the dogs.
[4722.51s -> 4725.10s]  This game's fun.
[4726.10s -> 4727.72s]  This game's like challenging and fun and stuff.
[4735.62s -> 4736.62s]  It's probably a real game.
[4739.52s -> 4740.76s]  Health pack.
[4741.76s -> 4742.76s]  A baby dragon or something and an egg.
[4743.94s -> 4746.78s]  An extra health.
[4747.78s -> 4748.78s]  Oh this really is.
[4755.65s -> 4756.65s]  Smoking is cool kids.
[4757.65s -> 4758.65s]  Why are you saying that it's not.
[4759.95s -> 4760.95s]  It's not cool.
[4780.94s -> 4781.94s]  What the fuck am I playing.
[4783.70s -> 4784.70s]  I'm confused of the enemy types here.
[4785.94s -> 4786.94s]  Usually they fall like a certain theme.
[4787.94s -> 4789.94s]  But it's like a bunch of just happy looking dogs.
[4791.37s -> 4792.37s]  Mixed in with.
[4794.25s -> 4795.25s]  Like.
[4796.25s -> 4797.25s]  I don't understand.
[4798.25s -> 4807.17s]  What am I fighting here.
[4814.30s -> 4820.91s]  What's the goal.
[4824.07s -> 4825.07s]  Why would this be this high.
[4830.73s -> 4831.73s]  I can't jump up here either.
[4831.73s -> 4834.12s]  I have to go down the holes.
[4835.12s -> 4836.12s]  I don't think that's what you do.
[4837.12s -> 4838.94s]  Can I climb this.
[4839.94s -> 4849.74s]  Next.
[4855.20s -> 4856.20s]  Journalist.
[4857.20s -> 4858.38s]  Stop.
[4859.38s -> 4860.68s]  How about a.
[4862.94s -> 4864.94s]  How about mighty final fight.
[4866.63s -> 4867.63s]  The stories start.
[4869.45s -> 4871.78s]  Right now.
[4872.78s -> 4874.53s]  Definitely not Capcom presents.
[4875.53s -> 4876.53s]  This is Metro City.
[4877.53s -> 4878.53s]  This is Metro City.
[4879.53s -> 4880.53s]  Within the walls of the city.
[4880.53s -> 4881.53s]  Jessica her beauty.
[4882.96s -> 4883.96s]  Raddy.
[4885.71s -> 4887.71s]  Aids throughout the city and gives the citizens.
[4890.55s -> 4891.55s]  Power to survive.
[4892.79s -> 4894.79s]  To survive all you have to do is not get caught.
[4895.79s -> 4898.10s]  This beacon of light all to himself.
[4906.18s -> 4907.18s]  With the girl she will be mine.
[4908.18s -> 4911.86s]  What.
[4912.86s -> 4913.86s]  A couple days later.
[4916.44s -> 4917.44s]  Jessica kidnapped.
[4918.74s -> 4919.74s]  Why.
[4920.74s -> 4921.74s]  What have you done to her Cody.
[4925.29s -> 4926.29s]  Me.
[4926.29s -> 4927.29s]  This is the work of the mad gear gang.
[4928.29s -> 4930.94s]  What do you think guy.
[4931.94s -> 4935.42s]  This is not a moment to spare.
[4936.42s -> 4937.42s]  Let's go.
[4941.22s -> 4942.22s]  Mighty final fight.
[4944.48s -> 4945.48s]  Cody.
[4946.48s -> 4947.48s]  A tough street fighter who is skilled with knives.
[4948.48s -> 4949.48s]  Guy.
[4950.48s -> 4951.48s]  Descended from ninja.
[4952.48s -> 4953.48s]  He possesses incredible agility.
[4954.72s -> 4957.24s]  And.
[4958.24s -> 4959.24s]  I thought I said Hagrid.
[4960.24s -> 4961.24s]  And Hagrid.
[4962.24s -> 4963.24s]  The hot tempered wrestler and mayor of Metro City.
[4968.26s -> 4969.26s]  This is the guy that you hold your arms out and you go.
[4970.26s -> 4971.26s]  You spin.
[4972.26s -> 4978.74s]  Old town slum.
[4979.74s -> 4981.11s]  Was that Australia.
[4982.11s -> 4983.11s]  This is definitely not final fight by the way.
[4985.57s -> 4986.57s]  This is.
[4987.57s -> 4988.57s]  Figurine.
[4989.57s -> 4990.57s]  Pop version.
[4995.01s -> 4996.01s]  That's kind of fun though.
[5003.71s -> 5010.71s]  This feels like a arcade game inside of a game that wants you to very clearly see that there are fun arcade cabinets to play in the game.
[5011.71s -> 5022.02s]  It's the same background for Contra.
[5023.02s -> 5024.02s]  Yeah it is.
[5025.02s -> 5026.26s]  It's the exact same one.
[5027.26s -> 5028.26s]  Auto Hotel is back.
[5036.38s -> 5037.38s]  That's swallowing that shit.
[5038.38s -> 5043.07s]  Maybe like puke.
[5044.07s -> 5045.07s]  Except we lost some real estate up top.
[5046.07s -> 5047.76s]  We can't see Auto Hotel.
[5048.76s -> 5050.83s]  This is a real NES game.
[5051.83s -> 5054.48s]  How come this experience points.
[5055.48s -> 5060.24s]  How do I do the spin move.
[5061.24s -> 5072.85s]  There it is.
[5073.85s -> 5077.71s]  This smile is so creepy.
[5078.71s -> 5081.68s]  Those eyes.
[5083.82s -> 5084.82s]  Holy shit.
[5086.95s -> 5087.95s]  A movie.
[5089.38s -> 5095.55s]  Of some kind.
[5096.55s -> 5103.49s]  Statue of Liberty.
[5104.49s -> 5105.49s]  Uh oh.
[5106.49s -> 5107.49s]  Other guy with big head.
[5110.33s -> 5111.33s]  Other player.
[5112.89s -> 5113.89s]  This feels like a second player.
[5121.82s -> 5123.58s]  Good Link.
[5124.58s -> 5125.75s]  Oh shit I'm dead.
[5126.75s -> 5132.47s]  I can come back though.
[5139.22s -> 5140.22s]  When I beat the boss I'll click the link.
[5141.22s -> 5144.31s]  Hold on.
[5145.31s -> 5146.31s]  What the fuck.
[5151.84s -> 5154.23s]  He just stun locked me.
[5154.23s -> 5155.23s]  4, 5 sec.
[5156.23s -> 5157.23s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.
[5158.23s -> 5159.23s]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.
[5161.30s -> 5162.30s]  You guys ever do that in your head.
[5163.30s -> 5164.30s]  You play beat em up.
[5165.30s -> 5166.30s]  You just repeat the same like.
[5167.30s -> 5168.30s]  Dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[5169.30s -> 5170.30s]  Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[5171.30s -> 5172.30s]  Dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[5173.80s -> 5174.80s]  I am Thrasher.
[5175.80s -> 5176.80s]  Ruler of this city.
[5177.80s -> 5178.80s]  Bow down before me.
[5180.23s -> 5181.23s]  Uh yes.
[5182.98s -> 5183.98s]  I am superior.
[5184.98s -> 5185.98s]  Maybe you're stronger than you look.
[5186.98s -> 5187.98s]  Why don't you join us.
[5189.35s -> 5191.87s]  Uh.
[5192.87s -> 5194.18s]  Yes.
[5195.18s -> 5196.18s]  I don't believe you.
[5197.18s -> 5198.18s]  You're too much of a mama's boy.

[5298.82s -> 5303.71s]  Keith out.
[5306.23s -> 5307.23s]  Purple.
[5309.62s -> 5310.62s]  My favorite color.
[5311.86s -> 5312.86s]  Purple.
[5313.86s -> 5314.86s]  Alright let me click the link.
[5317.64s -> 5318.64s]  Most popular kids characters.
[5330.12s -> 5331.12s]  Um.
[5332.12s -> 5336.75s]  Fortnite is Bugs Bunny.
[5337.75s -> 5340.02s]  Doctor Doom is.
[5347.27s -> 5348.27s]  This is not like.
[5362.87s -> 5363.87s]  Alright thank you.
[5364.87s -> 5367.90s]  All caps all caps all caps.

[5371.46s -> 5375.58s]  My link is better.
[5376.58s -> 5377.58s]  Is German suplexed that lady.
[5378.58s -> 5379.58s]  I just German suplexed.
[5380.58s -> 5381.58s]  I added an ED on there.
[5384.74s -> 5385.74s]  I don't know why.
[5393.13s -> 5394.13s]  Instead of just saying suplexed.
[5395.43s -> 5396.43s]  Like T.
[5399.78s -> 5400.78s]  Constantly screaming.
[5409.26s -> 5412.42s]  Jax.
[5413.42s -> 5414.42s]  Is he holding up like a football like Charlie Brown.
[5415.42s -> 5416.42s]  Is Lucy going to come over and kick that.
[5417.42s -> 5420.70s]  Who is he holding that for.
[5428.15s -> 5429.15s]  Okay here we go.
[5431.10s -> 5432.10s]  Here I come.
[5433.10s -> 5434.46s]  I'm going to get that football.
[5435.46s -> 5438.75s]  You dope Charlie Brown.
[5439.75s -> 5440.75s]  Why.
[5441.75s -> 5442.75s]  He doesn't need to like a curve of the frog thing.
[5444.44s -> 5445.44s]  He goes like.
[5446.44s -> 5449.34s]  Like Pee Wee Herman.
[5450.34s -> 5451.34s]  What's the Charlie Brown yell.
[5452.34s -> 5459.15s]  It's something like that isn't it.
[5460.15s -> 5461.15s]  I'm not trying to do it.
[5462.15s -> 5463.15s]  I'm just asking about the cadences.
[5464.15s -> 5465.15s]  I'm not talking about doing a voice.
[5466.71s -> 5467.71s]  I'm talking about the cadences.
[5469.34s -> 5470.34s]  Lucy holds it.
[5483.16s -> 5484.16s]  Yeah that's what I said.
[5485.16s -> 5486.16s]  Yeah and he turns his head up.
[5487.34s -> 5488.34s]  He has no mega lull mouth.
[5499.50s -> 5505.02s]  And it's like.
[5506.02s -> 5507.02s]  Same guy.
[5508.02s -> 5512.40s]  I kicked this guy's ass like five minutes ago.
[5513.40s -> 5514.40s]  Best feeling when you get a.
[5515.40s -> 5516.40s]  On two or three people at the same time.
[5532.36s -> 5533.36s]  The city in the background is melting.
[5534.36s -> 5537.07s]  Oh no.
[5538.07s -> 5539.07s]  There must be Cranky Kong.
[5556.89s -> 5557.89s]  This is a long level.
[5560.34s -> 5561.34s]  How dare you.
[5561.34s -> 5562.34s]  How dare you dress up in the same outfit as me.
[5565.70s -> 5566.70s]  Holy shit.
[5576.13s -> 5579.29s]  No.
[5581.68s -> 5582.68s]  There can only be like.
[5584.11s -> 5585.11s]  80 Darth Vader's walking around Comic Con.
[5586.11s -> 5587.11s]  81 is too much.
[5589.70s -> 5591.70s]  You're too fat and lazy to oppose me.
[5594.73s -> 5595.73s]  You're no match for me.
[5596.73s -> 5598.29s]  I am the slam master.
[5600.29s -> 5602.29s]  Get out of my way before I stomp you flat.
[5602.29s -> 5604.29s]  Are you done flapping those lips of yours.
[5605.29s -> 5606.29s]  Good.
[5607.29s -> 5608.29s]  Because I'm going to chop you down to size.
[5609.29s -> 5610.29s]  You think you can mess with the slam master.
[5611.29s -> 5612.29s]  Oh well I'm still alive.
[5622.81s -> 5623.81s]  Okay if you put graffiti on the ground.
[5626.20s -> 5627.20s]  It just says fighter.
[5628.20s -> 5629.20s]  Just fighter.
[5630.20s -> 5631.20s]  Is it.
[5633.21s -> 5638.86s]  Did he put that here to like give me like a finish line to cross so we fight.
[5639.86s -> 5640.86s]  Fight.
[5641.86s -> 5643.87s]  Fight here.
[5644.87s -> 5645.87s]  But he didn't have enough room to write fight here.
[5645.87s -> 5647.87s]  But he didn't have enough room to write fight here with a space.
[5648.87s -> 5649.87s]  So fight here.
[5660.46s -> 5662.46s]  The crowd is split on that one.
[5663.46s -> 5665.21s]  Ow.
[5666.21s -> 5675.64s]  What's next.
[5677.65s -> 5678.65s]  We could do kick master.
[5679.65s -> 5680.65s]  Did we do kick master.
[5681.65s -> 5686.02s]  I don't remember.
[5687.02s -> 5688.02s]  There's one of the scummy.
[5689.02s -> 5690.02s]  Oh that's shaking around.
[5691.02s -> 5692.02s]  There's one of the scummy living skeletons who attacked.
[5693.02s -> 5694.02s]  You humans think you're a match for belt head.
[5695.02s -> 5697.86s]  You can't even defeat me.
[5697.86s -> 5698.86s]  Thornalan weight.
[5699.86s -> 5701.30s]  Look at that like nerd.
[5702.30s -> 5703.30s]  Look at that like nerd neck.
[5704.30s -> 5711.31s]  My brother my steel is no match for these creatures.
[5712.31s -> 5713.31s]  Only with your great kicking ability.
[5714.31s -> 5715.31s]  Wait what.
[5717.00s -> 5718.00s]  Don't die.
[5721.16s -> 5722.16s]  Save the princess.
[5725.90s -> 5726.90s]  You're the last hope.
[5727.90s -> 5730.80s]  You'll pay for this belt head.
[5731.80s -> 5734.70s]  Your kicking ability.
[5735.70s -> 5737.70s]  Oh okay well I think I got a pretty good kicking ability.
[5739.14s -> 5740.14s]  I sure do.
[5740.14s -> 5742.46s]  It's great.
[5743.46s -> 5744.46s]  It's like the Rockets.
[5746.28s -> 5747.28s]  That's full range.
[5749.74s -> 5765.17s]  We have to go kill belt head.
[5768.97s -> 5769.97s]  Okay if you didn't kick so high.
[5770.97s -> 5771.97s]  You'd be able to hit them in the chest.
[5772.97s -> 5773.97s]  Therefore having a much larger hit box.
[5774.97s -> 5777.27s]  Kicking directly straight up in the air into the head.
[5778.27s -> 5780.27s]  Gives me such a small range to hit anybody.
[5780.27s -> 5783.86s]  Oh Diablo 2 Paladin Scepter.
[5786.86s -> 5790.25s]  Sorry I have to do that every time somebody says that word.
[5791.25s -> 5792.25s]  It's like you pulled the string on the back of the woody doll.
[5793.25s -> 5799.10s]  What is that?
[5802.38s -> 5803.38s]  You have found a bouncing bulb spirit.
[5804.38s -> 5806.38s]  This spirit will shoot bouncing balls to damage your enemies.
[5807.62s -> 5811.68s]  Don't drop it.
[5815.16s -> 5816.16s]  How do I do that?
[5817.85s -> 5822.26s]  Okay at some point you just punch in the air.
[5823.26s -> 5824.26s]  Right.
[5826.27s -> 5827.27s]  I get it but it's very impractical to do that.
[5827.27s -> 5828.27s]  Kill belt head.
[5837.64s -> 5838.64s]  Kill belt head.
[5839.64s -> 5847.28s]  I'm going to try.
[5848.28s -> 5851.25s]  I'm trying to collect all the jewels.
[5857.42s -> 5861.41s]  Taking power.
[5862.41s -> 5863.41s]  I have experience too.
[5864.41s -> 5865.41s]  I'm interested in this one.
[5868.63s -> 5869.63s]  We're going to stay here until I level up once.
[5879.51s -> 5880.51s]  MP huh?
[5881.51s -> 5886.53s]  Seinfeld?
[5887.53s -> 5892.48s]  Why am I Seinfeld streaming?
[5893.48s -> 5894.48s]  Watch out boss.
[5900.26s -> 5901.89s]  Is that belt head?
[5902.89s -> 5907.14s]  No that's definitely one of belt heads just chumps.
[5908.14s -> 5909.14s]  It's a witch.
[5912.23s -> 5913.79s]  It's Megalovania.
[5914.79s -> 5916.29s]  That was just Megalovania.
[5917.29s -> 5921.41s]  Holy shit what was that?
[5922.41s -> 5924.10s]  Did you hear that?
[5925.10s -> 5926.10s]  What the hell?
[5927.10s -> 5928.10s]  I almost want to die again to hear that.
[5941.16s -> 5942.16s]  Shit.
[5947.03s -> 5948.03s]  That hit me.
[5949.03s -> 5960.90s]  Really?
[5962.26s -> 5963.76s]  I hate the stupid kick to the side.
[5967.54s -> 5968.54s]  It sucked.
[5974.01s -> 5975.95s]  Come on.
[5976.95s -> 5977.95s]  I didn't pick it up.
[5978.95s -> 5979.95s]  What do I get now?
[5981.96s -> 5987.55s]  You have found the life up one magic.
[5988.55s -> 5989.55s]  G5.
[5990.55s -> 5991.55s]  G G O R C.
[5992.55s -> 5996.67s]  Magic.
[6001.30s -> 6002.30s]  Leaf and urn.
[6009.56s -> 6010.56s]  Caverns of no return.
[6014.92s -> 6015.92s]  Oh shit what's this?
[6017.93s -> 6018.93s]  Does it work?
[6025.03s -> 6026.03s]  The orb's not shooting at anything.
[6031.18s -> 6032.18s]  It's just a warcraft pet.
[6037.83s -> 6046.88s]  Doesn't do anything.
[6047.88s -> 6051.04s]  Here comes Megalovania.
[6052.04s -> 6053.04s]  It's close.
[6054.04s -> 6055.04s]  It's maybe one or two notes up.
[6056.04s -> 6068.16s]  That's the I want to avoid the copyright so I changed two notes version.
[6069.16s -> 6070.16s]  Man this game came out in the 90s.
[6071.16s -> 6072.16s]  Can you guys believe that?
[6073.16s -> 6074.16s]  This game came out in the 90s.
[6082.44s -> 6083.44s]  I got some super frogs.
[6087.69s -> 6089.69s]  I'm supposed to go up in the 90s.
[6090.69s -> 6095.32s]  20,000 upvotes.
[6096.32s -> 6114.71s]  You guys are terrible.
[6120.24s -> 6121.24s]  Play Melee?
[6122.24s -> 6123.24s]  Like Smash Brothers Melee?
[6132.54s -> 6134.30s]  Yes.
[6135.30s -> 6136.30s]  I'm not very good at Smash Brothers Melee.
[6137.30s -> 6138.30s]  I'm good at the one that I'm going to Smash Brothers Brawl.
[6140.37s -> 6141.37s]  Game where you can accidentally fall down.
[6147.28s -> 6148.52s]  Can I go up?
[6150.53s -> 6154.39s]  I can't go up.
[6154.39s -> 6157.55s]  It reminds me of Battletoads.
[6158.55s -> 6159.55s]  This part right here.
[6160.55s -> 6168.83s]  This exact section right now.
[6169.83s -> 6174.46s]  Play the Subspace Emissary.
[6175.46s -> 6176.46s]  I guarantee you you will love elevator action.
[6177.46s -> 6178.96s]  Where is it?
[6190.82s -> 6191.82s]  How about Saint?
[6200.25s -> 6201.25s]  Wait what?
[6228.26s -> 6229.26s]  It's supposed to be first and last name.
[6231.27s -> 6242.05s]  How do I go?
[6243.05s -> 6248.13s]  Can somebody help me here?
[6253.98s -> 6254.98s]  I have to write a paragraph?
[6265.18s -> 6266.18s]  What does this want me to do?
[6272.41s -> 6273.41s]  This is a puzzle.
[6274.41s -> 6275.41s]  This is a password screen.
[6277.22s -> 6283.71s]  How did I get to a password screen?
[6290.65s -> 6292.66s]  I just press start.
[6294.09s -> 6295.09s]  What was I called?
[6296.09s -> 6305.31s]  I have no idea why I didn't end up here.
[6308.86s -> 6311.38s]  I pressed start before.
[6314.34s -> 6315.97s]  This is the same sentence?
[6319.58s -> 6322.93s]  Somebody help me.
[6324.17s -> 6325.17s]  Seven senses.
[6326.17s -> 6327.17s]  Cosmo, life.
[6333.40s -> 6338.99s]  That was abrupt.
[6339.99s -> 6340.99s]  Cosmo and life are different stats.
[6349.27s -> 6350.27s]  Am I getting points for this?
[6357.98s -> 6361.26s]  I'm not getting points for that.
[6362.63s -> 6364.06s]  I did it too.
[6365.06s -> 6366.06s]  I watched them do it so many times that I did it.
[6367.69s -> 6368.69s]  I don't have to fight or anything.
[6369.69s -> 6372.53s]  Just walk.
[6373.53s -> 6374.53s]  They all die anyways.
[6379.54s -> 6380.54s]  This is freaking me out.
[6385.43s -> 6386.43s]  I can't do it.
[6387.43s -> 6392.51s]  It's freaking me out.
[6395.29s -> 6396.29s]  Hold on.
[6401.24s -> 6402.24s]  The jump is so weird.
[6403.24s -> 6404.24s]  It's like a Jump King jump.
[6407.72s -> 6408.72s]  That's the only way I can describe it.
[6411.43s -> 6412.43s]  Rocks?
[6417.45s -> 6427.84s]  Are we getting a finger wag?
[6429.72s -> 6430.72s]  What does this say?
[6431.72s -> 6432.72s]  It's a selector.
[6434.41s -> 6435.41s]  I apparently made them very angry.
[6436.41s -> 6440.34s]  Stop that please.
[6441.34s -> 6442.77s]  I don't know what happened.
[6443.77s -> 6444.77s]  What are these?
[6447.22s -> 6448.22s]  I don't have a crosshair.
[6449.22s -> 6450.22s]  It's barely showing up on my screen.
[6453.96s -> 6466.02s]  What are these?
[6469.69s -> 6470.69s]  Up right, up left.
[6471.69s -> 6472.69s]  Fight, call, friends, talk, and data.
[6479.50s -> 6489.70s]  Fight.
[6491.32s -> 6492.32s]  It doesn't want to fight me.
[6502.52s -> 6510.29s]  What did they say?
[6511.29s -> 6512.29s]  It's the same elevator action waiting room.
[6515.26s -> 6517.39s]  Where is it?
[6518.95s -> 6519.95s]  I'll find it.
[6520.95s -> 6524.88s]  There it is.
[6529.83s -> 6530.83s]  Elevator, action.
[6542.70s -> 6546.18s]  Is this supposed to be me?
[6547.18s -> 6548.18s]  Why am I Indiana Jonesing into an apartment building?
[6554.41s -> 6555.41s]  I just shot the guy in the head.
[6560.28s -> 6561.28s]  What the?
[6565.91s -> 6566.91s]  Are they going to get in the elevator?
[6569.88s -> 6570.88s]  They're getting in the elevator.
[6575.45s -> 6576.45s]  Don't shoot me.
[6579.03s -> 6582.58s]  He got me.
[6585.61s -> 6587.30s]  What's the goal?
[6588.30s -> 6589.86s]  Just get all the way to the bottom?
[6590.86s -> 6595.04s]  I can control the elevator.
[6596.04s -> 6597.04s]  Imagine being able to do this in an actual elevator.
[6598.04s -> 6599.04s]  There's a button and you can just go up and down yourself
[6600.04s -> 6601.04s]  and not have to open it.
[6604.33s -> 6605.33s]  I'd say like, hey, meet me downstairs to somebody.
[6606.33s -> 6607.33s]  Take the stairs.
[6608.33s -> 6612.38s]  And I just wouldn't show up.
[6613.38s -> 6614.38s]  I would make them find me on the middle floor,
[6615.38s -> 6616.38s]  like open the doors and be like, hey, dickhead.
[6617.38s -> 6619.97s]  And then close it and keep going down and keep going up.
[6622.17s -> 6623.17s]  I don't think...
[6634.39s -> 6644.02s]  Who shot me?
[6645.02s -> 6646.02s]  I just took the lights out.
[6650.39s -> 6652.72s]  How do I get...
[6661.69s -> 6663.95s]  I got to go in that orange door.
[6664.95s -> 6672.91s]  Go in the door.
[6673.91s -> 6686.67s]  Wait, stairs.
[6687.67s -> 6691.33s]  Where am I?
[6692.33s -> 6693.33s]  See that shit?
[6703.72s -> 6709.70s]  That's called a duck.
[6710.70s -> 6714.62s]  Getting down to the bottom.
[6716.31s -> 6717.31s]  This is going to be tricky.
[6727.75s -> 6729.95s]  Down, down, down, down.
[6730.95s -> 6731.95s]  Shit.
[6732.95s -> 6733.95s]  Oh, man.
[6740.34s -> 6749.20s]  Oh, shit.
[6750.20s -> 6752.14s]  How about just wars?
[6760.86s -> 6761.86s]  Wars?
[6764.95s -> 6770.29s]  Is it a tournament?
[6771.53s -> 6772.53s]  I'm the penguin.
[6783.75s -> 6785.38s]  Just dumb lock him.
[6786.38s -> 6787.38s]  Don't let him get up.
[6789.38s -> 6790.69s]  Don't let him get up.
[6791.69s -> 6792.69s]  Keep hitting him in the head.
[6793.69s -> 6800.94s]  Until the referee stops the fight.
[6801.94s -> 6802.94s]  A get perfect game.
[6805.40s -> 6806.40s]  A get a set.
[6811.99s -> 6812.99s]  Let's go.
[6813.99s -> 6814.99s]  I know what to do.
[6817.13s -> 6818.13s]  He's going to get all the balls on the other side.
[6819.13s -> 6821.07s]  Shit.
[6822.07s -> 6823.07s]  I like this game.
[6824.07s -> 6826.66s]  This game's fun.
[6827.66s -> 6828.66s]  Why can't they have...
[6829.66s -> 6835.06s]  I want to play this game in real life.
[6837.77s -> 6838.77s]  I've got time.
[6841.10s -> 6842.10s]  Come on.
[6844.23s -> 6845.23s]  No, shit.
[6846.47s -> 6847.47s]  Come on, get it over there.
[6853.32s -> 6854.32s]  I love this one.
[6857.35s -> 6859.62s]  This one's so much fun.
[6860.62s -> 6868.11s]  Shit, he's got more over here.
[6869.29s -> 6870.29s]  Get it.
[6872.74s -> 6873.74s]  What is that boomerang?
[6875.24s -> 6881.79s]  Stop, stop, stop.
[6889.43s -> 6890.43s]  That's got to be it.
[6891.43s -> 6893.38s]  I win.
[6896.09s -> 6897.09s]  Oh, yeah, I win.
[6900.82s -> 6901.82s]  Goodbye.
[6903.58s -> 6904.58s]  Perfect game.
[6905.58s -> 6906.58s]  Be good, be good, be good.
[6910.31s -> 6911.31s]  I'm overwhelmed with the hell out of him right now.
[6912.31s -> 6919.38s]  You're in trouble, dude.
[6927.98s -> 6928.98s]  That one's going fast.
[6929.98s -> 6930.98s]  I have a spoiler.
[6931.98s -> 6932.98s]  I have to say it.
[6933.98s -> 6934.98s]  I'm going to talk about Star Wars for a second.
[6935.98s -> 6936.98s]  Star Wars Rogue One.
[6937.98s -> 6939.98s]  If you haven't seen Star Wars Rogue One, mute the microphone for five seconds.
[6940.98s -> 6942.79s]  Mute the microphone for five seconds.
[6943.79s -> 6944.79s]  Just mute.
[6945.79s -> 6953.05s]  I don't have to say anything.
[6954.05s -> 6957.46s]  You know what I was going to say.
[6958.46s -> 6959.46s]  You know exactly what I was going to tell you.
[6959.46s -> 6964.54s]  I don't know if it's against Panda.
[6965.54s -> 6966.54s]  I heard Panda's a pretty top seed.
[6967.54s -> 6968.54s]  He is.
[6980.66s -> 6981.66s]  You guys don't know what I'm talking about?
[6982.66s -> 6983.66s]  I have to say it.
[6984.66s -> 6985.66s]  It's in Rogue One.
[6986.66s -> 6989.12s]  It's the movie.
[6990.12s -> 6991.12s]  Whatever, I don't care.
[6992.12s -> 6997.01s]  I can only know.
[6998.01s -> 7000.59s]  I'm going to say it.
[7001.59s -> 7002.59s]  I'm going to say Rogue One spoilers.
[7003.59s -> 7004.59s]  Seriously, don't come back and tell everyone this chat says to come back.
[7005.59s -> 7006.59s]  Here we go.
[7007.59s -> 7008.59s]  Here comes a Rogue One spoiler.
[7009.59s -> 7010.59s]  I'm not kidding.
[7011.59s -> 7013.59s]  This is the fucking movie when Darth Vader shows up.
[7014.59s -> 7015.59s]  And it's like...
[7017.54s -> 7018.54s]  It was that exact same sound effect.
[7019.78s -> 7020.78s]  And now I lost because I was paying attention.
[7028.03s -> 7029.03s]  Okay, you're good.
[7035.33s -> 7036.33s]  Everyone can come back.
[7046.98s -> 7048.60s]  Star Wars fucking sucks.
[7049.60s -> 7059.99s]  Get off me.
[7060.99s -> 7062.42s]  Oh my god, he just perfected me.
[7063.42s -> 7065.82s]  All right, where else are we going?
[7066.82s -> 7070.04s]  How about...
[7073.33s -> 7074.33s]  Did I do baseball?
[7076.14s -> 7077.70s]  I didn't do baseball.
[7078.70s -> 7079.70s]  Here's your team.
[7079.70s -> 7080.70s]  CDGs, SSTs, or Ws.
[7081.70s -> 7082.70s]  All right, it doesn't matter.
[7088.36s -> 7089.36s]  Me swinging.
[7091.50s -> 7092.50s]  161 kilometers an hour.
[7094.06s -> 7095.30s]  How fast is that?
[7098.33s -> 7099.33s]  Isn't that like 150 miles per hour?
[7109.27s -> 7118.83s]  I just want to hit a home run.
[7119.83s -> 7124.91s]  Let me hit one home run and I'm done.
[7125.91s -> 7129.58s]  That's close enough.
[7132.49s -> 7133.49s]  Clap, nice homer.
[7134.49s -> 7135.49s]  Nice run.
[7140.25s -> 7143.54s]  Where are we going?
[7144.54s -> 7148.34s]  How about brush roller?
[7150.41s -> 7152.74s]  I like it already.
[7156.66s -> 7160.53s]  Is that a loading screen?
[7161.53s -> 7163.53s]  Instead of collecting the things, you just have to paint the ground?
[7164.53s -> 7171.46s]  Yeah, it is.
[7172.46s -> 7175.88s]  It's actually kind of cute.
[7176.88s -> 7180.87s]  It's Splatoon.
[7188.64s -> 7189.64s]  Look at the cat.
[7190.64s -> 7191.64s]  Why are there cats everywhere?
[7192.94s -> 7193.94s]  And a guy driving a car into a wall.
[7194.94s -> 7196.57s]  Does that guy just get into an accident?
[7197.57s -> 7198.57s]  The car looks a little scrunched, doesn't it?
[7199.57s -> 7200.81s]  It looks like squished.
[7201.81s -> 7209.64s]  I think that guy's in trouble.
[7210.64s -> 7211.64s]  Get away.
[7225.49s -> 7226.49s]  Okay, Volgaard 2.
[7228.05s -> 7229.05s]  Or how about Xevious?
[7229.05s -> 7235.98s]  Oh, it's just a vertical shooter.
[7236.98s -> 7241.74s]  Those rings?
[7242.74s -> 7246.20s]  They're just like bathroom washers.
[7247.20s -> 7250.66s]  This is like one of the bins at Home Depot.
[7251.66s -> 7262.37s]  This is it?
[7290.29s -> 7291.29s]  This is my favorite game.
[7291.29s -> 7292.46s]  Your taste is...
[7293.70s -> 7294.70s]  How about...
[7295.70s -> 7297.65s]  Arena.
[7303.50s -> 7312.16s]  I'm gonna pin to the wall.
[7319.29s -> 7320.29s]  I don't understand what's going on.
[7323.70s -> 7324.70s]  Do I have a projectile?
[7325.70s -> 7327.14s]  I don't see a projectile, and I can't...
[7328.14s -> 7329.14s]  I was about to hit the reset button, but I'm gonna try it again.
[7334.79s -> 7335.79s]  Battle for Home Depot.
[7338.57s -> 7339.57s]  I can't get both of those guys at the same time.
[7342.98s -> 7343.98s]  Go for the guy on the left first?
[7344.98s -> 7347.82s]  This is impossible.
[7348.82s -> 7354.10s]  It's not possible. The game's incompletable.
[7355.10s -> 7363.50s]  I gotta go to RNG. This might work.
[7364.50s -> 7365.50s]  Tell the muted people to come back.
[7370.90s -> 7371.90s]  Fire alert!
[7376.60s -> 7377.60s]  I did Bird Week already.
[7381.34s -> 7382.34s]  How about Bugs War?
[7383.34s -> 7384.64s]  Yep.
[7393.50s -> 7395.57s]  Do I have a spider?
[7396.57s -> 7400.62s]  I have a bomb.
[7401.62s -> 7403.82s]  Wait, what happened?
[7404.82s -> 7405.82s]  Wait, this is Battleship.
[7406.82s -> 7410.22s]  It's Battleship but one flare.
[7415.42s -> 7416.42s]  I have to drop it on caterpillars?
[7417.42s -> 7423.53s]  Okay, yep.
[7424.53s -> 7425.53s]  I got him.
[7428.30s -> 7431.21s]  It's Minesweeper?
[7432.21s -> 7433.21s]  No, this is just Battleship.
[7433.21s -> 7436.75s]  Is he dead?
[7439.40s -> 7442.62s]  Two more. The head and the tail?
[7443.62s -> 7444.62s]  I kind of feel bad. I'm killing him very slowly.
[7445.62s -> 7446.62s]  This is horrible.
[7464.95s -> 7465.95s]  They don't even fight back.
[7466.95s -> 7471.26s]  Yeah, they don't fight back. I don't like this one.
[7472.26s -> 7479.65s]  You sunk my caterpillar.
[7480.65s -> 7484.00s]  I didn't want to see what Squoon was.
[7485.00s -> 7486.56s]  Looks very interesting.
[7487.56s -> 7489.56s]  Yep. I have no idea what's going on with this title screen.
[7491.63s -> 7493.63s]  Those sharks are eating people.
[7495.77s -> 7496.77s]  Holy shit, this is horrible.
[7497.77s -> 7503.38s]  It's just the Mario level from Mario Land on the Game Boy.
[7507.94s -> 7508.94s]  Why is there a city down here?
[7511.72s -> 7518.34s]  Wait, there's an entire...
[7519.34s -> 7527.81s]  It's supposed to be Atlantis?
[7528.81s -> 7532.54s]  This one's good.
[7540.12s -> 7541.12s]  This is a fun one.
[7543.13s -> 7544.13s]  Pretty good maneuvering right there, I think.
[7547.03s -> 7555.52s]  I don't think I can kill the sharks over there.
[7556.82s -> 7557.82s]  I think those are my friends.
[7567.06s -> 7572.98s]  What's the first boss, what do you think?
[7573.98s -> 7575.34s]  I'm going to say Giant Squid.
[7588.68s -> 7592.54s]  What do you think?
[7593.54s -> 7597.09s]  I thought that was health.
[7598.52s -> 7599.52s]  It looked like health.
[7600.95s -> 7601.95s]  First boss incoming.
[7604.41s -> 7610.64s]  Ooh, this one's good.
[7611.64s -> 7612.64s]  I like this one a lot.
[7625.27s -> 7626.27s]  That juke.
[7627.27s -> 7628.70s]  Come on, continue.
[7638.33s -> 7639.33s]  Submarine is cute?
[7641.27s -> 7642.27s]  Yeah, submarine is cute.
[7646.01s -> 7649.62s]  Wait, hold on.
[7650.62s -> 7652.16s]  That's the Star Fox font.
[7653.16s -> 7657.02s]  I have a lot of hopes for this one.
[7658.02s -> 7659.02s]  It's training, command, and adventure.
[7663.21s -> 7665.34s]  I think this is supposed to be text.
[7666.34s -> 7667.34s]  Oh, we have E's and B's.
[7670.95s -> 7673.95s]  Wait, is this like an old text-based RPG?
[7680.82s -> 7681.82s]  I selected B.
[7691.96s -> 7705.04s]  There's a dot on the screen, but what is it?
[7706.04s -> 7707.04s]  Am I facing the right direction?
[7708.04s -> 7716.51s]  How do I get the dot on my screen?
[7722.74s -> 7723.74s]  I don't get it.
[7724.74s -> 7728.61s]  Oh, shit, I'm flying.
[7743.54s -> 7744.54s]  Where am I supposed to go?
[7747.38s -> 7748.38s]  I'm going so fast.
[7752.76s -> 7753.76s]  That's me right there, but where am I supposed to go?
[7754.76s -> 7757.54s]  All right, we're going to E.
[7775.93s -> 7778.58s]  That was blinking.
[7781.67s -> 7793.79s]  Oh, there's something here.
[7796.12s -> 7804.14s]  Alien life.
[7805.14s -> 7806.14s]  I'm on a stale.
[7814.74s -> 7815.74s]  I could be flying upside down right now.
[7818.97s -> 7822.83s]  I have no idea.
[7823.83s -> 7844.34s]  Get the fuck out of here.
[7846.92s -> 7847.92s]  Get me out of here.
[7848.92s -> 7849.92s]  Wait, I want to do adventure.
[7856.15s -> 7859.82s]  I want to see.
[7862.60s -> 7871.71s]  Uh-oh.
[7875.32s -> 7876.32s]  I don't even remember what it was called.
[7880.25s -> 7883.66s]  Was it Squoon? Starluster.
[7884.66s -> 7886.22s]  Adventure.
[7887.53s -> 7888.53s]  Here we go.
[7892.14s -> 7893.14s]  Let's see.
[7894.14s -> 7908.43s]  We're going to go over here.
[7912.87s -> 7916.29s]  What's here?
[7917.29s -> 7918.29s]  Radio.
[7921.96s -> 7922.96s]  I'd like to have a radio frequent.
[7923.96s -> 7928.21s]  Who cares?
[7935.85s -> 7937.22s]  Ready?
[7938.22s -> 7943.55s]  This is a cooking game?
[7944.55s -> 7945.55s]  Watch out for the dogs and collect all the food.
[7946.55s -> 7947.55s]  This is Donald Duck.
[7949.69s -> 7952.02s]  It's Chubby Cherub.
[7953.02s -> 7957.33s]  I'm going to sneeze.
[7960.10s -> 7961.10s]  Sorry, I can't hit.
[7964.78s -> 7965.78s]  Nice, Ron.
[7966.78s -> 7967.95s]  I sneeze.
[7968.95s -> 7977.62s]  I'm not allowed to sneeze.
[7981.99s -> 7982.99s]  There we go.
[7982.99s -> 7983.99s]  That's better.
[7985.42s -> 7986.92s]  Now the reference can be complete.
[7993.02s -> 7994.02s]  I never have to do it again.
[7995.02s -> 7998.38s]  Did that kill me?
[7999.38s -> 8000.38s]  It's been two.
[8001.38s -> 8002.38s]  You have a choice.
[8004.51s -> 8015.78s]  2021, year of the nice Ron.
[8016.78s -> 8021.41s]  I can fly.
[8023.22s -> 8033.17s]  That would have been nice to know.
[8034.17s -> 8036.43s]  Is this the life of a seagull?
[8037.61s -> 8041.02s]  Like a pigeon?
[8042.02s -> 8043.02s]  I'm just flying around eating apple cores.
[8047.27s -> 8048.27s]  I'm done.
[8051.75s -> 8054.21s]  Not allowed to sneeze Andy.
[8060.70s -> 8061.70s]  Did we do Banana Prince?
[8066.52s -> 8067.52s]  We did, right?
[8068.52s -> 8070.72s]  Bomb sweeper?
[8071.72s -> 8072.72s]  No, 10 yard fight.
[8073.72s -> 8074.72s]  We're close to 10 yards.
[8076.98s -> 8080.53s]  Isn't football 100?
[8086.76s -> 8087.76s]  Do I have the ball?
[8101.22s -> 8106.24s]  This is a dance.
[8107.24s -> 8112.32s]  Do I get to pick a play?
[8113.32s -> 8117.12s]  Tap dancing.
[8119.58s -> 8126.77s]  We're going to get it.
[8127.77s -> 8132.14s]  First to 10.
[8137.99s -> 8139.68s]  Interception.
[8145.34s -> 8146.34s]  Did you intercept it?
[8149.75s -> 8150.75s]  No.
[8153.14s -> 8154.14s]  Look at me.
[8155.14s -> 8158.37s]  Look at me.
[8159.37s -> 8160.61s]  This is another interception.
[8162.68s -> 8163.68s]  If I throw for an interception,
[8165.50s -> 8166.50s]  why am I throwing?
[8167.86s -> 8168.86s]  No, it's just putting me back 20 yards.
[8178.87s -> 8181.87s]  Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[8187.59s -> 8188.59s]  What the fuck is this?
[8189.59s -> 8192.56s]  How can you even understand American football?
[8193.93s -> 8194.93s]  Look, here's how it works.
[8196.49s -> 8197.49s]  When somebody has the ball,
[8198.49s -> 8200.18s]  they have to just go 10 yards somehow.
[8201.54s -> 8202.54s]  If they do not go 10 yards,
[8203.54s -> 8204.54s]  they have to try again.
[8205.54s -> 8206.54s]  You can only try four times
[8207.54s -> 8208.54s]  before you have to give the team the other ball
[8209.54s -> 8210.78s]  and they do it the other way.
[8215.54s -> 8216.54s]  That's it.
[8217.54s -> 8218.54s]  Yeah, you're probably like,
[8219.85s -> 8220.85s]  what the fuck are those for?
[8229.70s -> 8240.86s]  There is like a bonus feature.
[8242.10s -> 8243.10s]  Are you fucking kidding me?
[8246.39s -> 8247.39s]  By the way, this is not supposed to be happening.
[8249.21s -> 8250.21s]  If I throw an interception,
[8251.21s -> 8256.35s]  that's a safety.
[8257.35s -> 8258.35s]  20 yards back, I'm in my own goal.
[8266.76s -> 8278.94s]  Wait, I can't leave?
[8280.70s -> 8281.94s]  What was that gun?
[8295.53s -> 8297.28s]  What?
[8298.28s -> 8300.61s]  What was that?
[8306.65s -> 8309.42s]  How about pack land?
[8318.41s -> 8319.71s]  This one should be good.
[8320.71s -> 8321.71s]  Oh, yes.
[8322.71s -> 8323.71s]  And all the directionals are just jump.
[8324.71s -> 8329.47s]  It's really weird.
[8330.47s -> 8334.51s]  This is the smash stage?
[8335.51s -> 8346.03s]  Why do you have a zoomer haircut?
[8347.03s -> 8360.24s]  It actually is the smash stage?
[8362.38s -> 8363.38s]  I don't think there's an end.
[8370.50s -> 8371.50s]  I think we just walk forward forever.
[8372.50s -> 8373.50s]  It's break time.
[8396.99s -> 8397.99s]  What song is this?
[8399.62s -> 8405.27s]  I've heard this song.
[8406.27s -> 8412.06s]  Where?
[8413.06s -> 8414.30s]  It's the pack land stage one.
[8417.52s -> 8419.08s]  What is it though?
[8419.08s -> 8422.09s]  It's toxic by Britney Spears.
[8433.63s -> 8435.63s]  Don't you know that you're toxic?
[8440.97s -> 8441.97s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[8442.97s -> 8443.97s]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[8459.75s -> 8460.75s]  Is it close?
[8461.75s -> 8464.98s]  It's not even close.
[8469.52s -> 8470.52s]  Is it close?
[8470.52s -> 8471.52s]  I don't even care.
[8482.74s -> 8483.74s]  I'm not going to play through the speakers.
[8490.21s -> 8491.45s]  No, it's not.
[8492.45s -> 8495.48s]  It's not even close.
[8497.23s -> 8498.23s]  It's not even close.
[8499.23s -> 8501.23s]  In some way, it could be.
[8503.43s -> 8505.43s]  It's very much not even close.
[8506.43s -> 8507.43s]  But I kind of understand what you mean.
[8516.67s -> 8519.67s]  Don't you know that you're toxic?
[8532.39s -> 8533.39s]  I can't help it.
[8534.39s -> 8535.39s]  Can we stop this game?
[8539.10s -> 8542.01s]  Okay, where are we going?
[8547.15s -> 8548.15s]  We didn't play Street Fighter.
[8549.15s -> 8551.15s]  Street Fighter 12 peoples.
[8552.97s -> 8557.97s]  USA, Japan, USA, China, India, Japan, USA, Brazil.
[8558.97s -> 8559.97s]  Is this supposed to be a map?
[8561.66s -> 8562.66s]  Is this supposed to be a map of the world?
[8563.66s -> 8567.28s]  USS the United States of...
[8568.28s -> 8569.28s]  What?
[8570.28s -> 8571.28s]  This is supposed to be R.
[8572.65s -> 8573.65s]  China is below Russia.
[8573.65s -> 8574.65s]  And then Japan.
[8575.65s -> 8576.65s]  Japan's right there.
[8577.65s -> 8578.65s]  Japan's there.
[8579.65s -> 8580.65s]  There's two USAs.
[8582.59s -> 8583.59s]  And then there's India.
[8584.59s -> 8593.45s]  And then Japan again.
[8594.45s -> 8595.45s]  United Soviet States of America.
[8596.45s -> 8597.45s]  Okay.
[8598.45s -> 8601.35s]  I don't know what to press.
[8602.35s -> 8603.59s]  Name, Chun-Li, birthday.
[8604.59s -> 8605.59s]  Resize, B, 80s blood type.
[8606.59s -> 8615.38s]  Wait, okay, that's bullshit.
[8616.38s -> 8639.30s]  Try that again.
[8648.67s -> 8649.67s]  Do the...
[8650.67s -> 8657.22s]  I can't even get up.
[8660.13s -> 8661.13s]  Hadouken spammed.
[8665.06s -> 8667.06s]  Zero.
[8668.06s -> 8669.06s]  Actually skip this stream.
[8678.18s -> 8679.18s]  What?
[8680.48s -> 8681.48s]  How about challenger?
[8682.48s -> 8683.48s]  Real time action adventure.
[8684.85s -> 8686.79s]  Something's wrong with that text.
[8687.79s -> 8688.79s]  Level, L or H.
[8691.06s -> 8692.06s]  Low or high.
[8693.30s -> 8694.30s]  All right, where should I put the gas tank?
[8695.86s -> 8698.50s]  Should I put it at I don't have to go to the gas station?
[8700.51s -> 8704.31s]  Or that's the next thing I have to do.
[8705.31s -> 8712.95s]  I'm going to break down.
[8717.20s -> 8720.36s]  These are spoilers.
[8721.36s -> 8724.71s]  I don't want to see this.
[8725.71s -> 8735.34s]  I didn't stop the express.
[8742.26s -> 8743.26s]  I'm coming, princess.
[8752.37s -> 8755.40s]  I'll get it.
[8756.40s -> 8757.40s]  Don't you know that you're toxic.
[8768.47s -> 8769.47s]  Don't run too fast.
[8770.47s -> 8771.47s]  The game's really laggy.
[8775.14s -> 8777.02s]  There's a guy up here.
[8778.02s -> 8780.35s]  There he is.
[8781.35s -> 8782.35s]  Come on.
[8784.30s -> 8785.30s]  Stop.
[8786.30s -> 8795.09s]  I can't help it.
[8796.09s -> 8797.09s]  I'm going to keep going.
[8797.09s -> 8802.87s]  Where was I even looking?
[8803.87s -> 8804.87s]  My eyes weren't a chat.
[8806.50s -> 8807.50s]  They weren't on the screen.
[8808.50s -> 8809.50s]  Where was I even looking?
[8810.50s -> 8811.67s]  Where were my eyes?
[8812.67s -> 8813.67s]  What was I looking at?
[8814.67s -> 8815.67s]  Above the monitor?
[8816.67s -> 8817.67s]  I have no idea.
[8818.67s -> 8824.01s]  I did it again.
[8825.01s -> 8826.01s]  I did it again.
[8834.61s -> 8835.61s]  I'm going to get to the end of the train right now.
[8838.83s -> 8839.83s]  Let's go.
[8842.22s -> 8843.22s]  Oops, I did it.
[8844.22s -> 8845.22s]  Oops, I did it again.
[8845.22s -> 8846.22s]  I'm lost in the scene.
[8847.22s -> 8848.22s]  Oh, baby, baby.
[8849.22s -> 8860.96s]  Is he throwing shit underneath?
[8870.84s -> 8871.84s]  They're coming from all angles.
[8872.84s -> 8874.27s]  They're coming from all angles now.
[8875.27s -> 8878.43s]  Jerry, they're coming from all angles.
[8883.90s -> 8884.90s]  The storm?
[8885.90s -> 8886.90s]  Is that alive?
[8888.71s -> 8889.71s]  This is a mess.
[8890.71s -> 8891.71s]  When I walk forward, it comes with me.
[8892.71s -> 8893.71s]  What the fuck?
[8896.81s -> 8897.81s]  I did it again.
[8898.81s -> 8899.81s]  I'm lost in your heart.
[8900.81s -> 8912.67s]  I'm lost in the scene.
[8913.67s -> 8917.15s]  What about War Wolf?
[8918.15s -> 8919.84s]  Right, that's it.
[8922.10s -> 8923.10s]  It's just AAA.
[8926.71s -> 8927.71s]  No idea what this says.
[8928.71s -> 8932.38s]  War Wolf is coming to town.
[8933.38s -> 8937.50s]  One player push start.
[8941.18s -> 8942.18s]  Which one of us is the War Wolf?
[8943.18s -> 8949.34s]  Is that the War Wolf?
[8950.34s -> 8951.34s]  You guys can figure that out.
[8956.36s -> 8965.34s]  Okay, wait.
[8966.34s -> 8970.27s]  Look at that neck.
[8971.27s -> 8972.83s]  Is there anything I can do?
[8973.83s -> 8987.49s]  I have an anger meter?
[8988.49s -> 8989.49s]  It's punching him in the groin over and over again.
[8990.49s -> 8992.49s]  This is the most coward way to fight somebody right now.
[8993.49s -> 8994.49s]  Really?
[8995.49s -> 8997.49s]  I will challenge you in a one on one battle.
[8998.49s -> 8999.49s]  We'll see who the strongest grappler is.
[9000.49s -> 9004.49s]  I'm going to crouch down and punch you in the groin and run away every time.
[9013.22s -> 9014.22s]  I think I just transformed twice.
[9015.22s -> 9018.90s]  Okay, we went from beast to raccoon.
[9019.90s -> 9021.66s]  What is going on here?
[9022.66s -> 9023.66s]  Okay, please stop that.
[9024.66s -> 9025.66s]  I have to turn it off if it keeps doing this.
[9026.66s -> 9030.97s]  Alright, so you saw the transformation.
[9030.97s -> 9035.97s]  This is not the type of move I would expect from that elaborate, insane transformation.
[9036.97s -> 9057.34s]  Ah, shit.
[9058.34s -> 9059.34s]  What's that?
[9060.34s -> 9063.38s]  Rise from the grave.
[9064.38s -> 9065.38s]  Altered Beast, right?
[9066.38s -> 9075.69s]  You guys ever feel like Altered Beast is the type of old, nostalgic kind of Genesis game that they're going to make into a Netflix series?
[9076.69s -> 9078.70s]  I could feel that, couldn't you?
[9079.70s -> 9080.70s]  I could see that.
[9088.53s -> 9090.53s]  Because there's absolutely no lore there and they can just make up an entire thing.
[9090.53s -> 9091.53s]  Maybe that Genesis game?
[9092.53s -> 9093.53s]  Altered Beast.
[9094.53s -> 9107.75s]  As long as they get like 10,000 streams, I'm sure it'll be worth it.
[9108.75s -> 9109.75s]  Climb this.
[9112.91s -> 9114.79s]  Climb this.
[9118.46s -> 9119.46s]  Nice.
[9125.12s -> 9131.80s]  This game's actually pretty rad.
[9132.80s -> 9135.96s]  I want to do the boss fight.
[9136.96s -> 9137.96s]  Don't knock.
[9139.58s -> 9140.58s]  Well, I have to knock it now.
[9141.58s -> 9142.58s]  Wait, don't knock.
[9154.32s -> 9159.72s]  Of course I have to knock that now.
[9160.72s -> 9161.72s]  I lost my...
[9162.72s -> 9164.66s]  I shouldn't have knocked.
[9165.66s -> 9166.66s]  Oh, we're going.
[9168.48s -> 9171.45s]  Did Rockin' Cats.
[9172.45s -> 9174.33s]  Did Bird Week.
[9176.40s -> 9180.39s]  Did Bomberman.
[9181.39s -> 9188.65s]  Crackin' Pop?
[9190.46s -> 9192.73s]  Crackin' Pop was a bomb.
[9194.86s -> 9201.29s]  This game sucks.
[9216.86s -> 9217.86s]  What is that guy with the pill doing?
[9218.86s -> 9221.45s]  Bubble Bobble monster is here?
[9223.71s -> 9230.97s]  Am I taking too long?
[9231.97s -> 9235.13s]  Those legs.
[9235.13s -> 9237.13s]  Tonight's gonna be a good night.
[9238.56s -> 9240.56s]  Tonight's gonna be a good night.
[9241.86s -> 9244.86s]  Tonight's gonna be a good, good night.
[9251.61s -> 9252.61s]  That meme is going parabolic.
[9256.09s -> 9257.90s]  I'm sorry.
[9260.62s -> 9261.62s]  What about Spelunker?
[9270.54s -> 9277.28s]  I died.
[9278.28s -> 9279.28s]  I'm dead.
[9287.99s -> 9288.99s]  And again, I have a machine gun.
[9292.34s -> 9294.10s]  There's a gold coin, I can get the gold coins.
[9295.10s -> 9301.70s]  Here's the item shop.
[9303.38s -> 9304.94s]  Really?
[9307.53s -> 9308.70s]  That's not very far to fall.
[9309.70s -> 9311.26s]  I've had enough of that one.
[9317.88s -> 9320.21s]  Can we do aimless?
[9323.56s -> 9325.56s]  Nope, but I can see...
[9331.73s -> 9332.73s]  I would be...
[9333.73s -> 9336.73s]  This would be very impressive for an 11-year-old school project.
[9339.25s -> 9341.25s]  This would be like, holy shit, this is incredible work.
[9342.25s -> 9347.26s]  The 12-year-old that made this in the computer lab, you are really going places.
[9348.26s -> 9349.26s]  You really are.
[9350.26s -> 9351.26s]  I'm not even kidding around.
[9353.07s -> 9355.50s]  You're getting into programming and you're learning.
[9355.50s -> 9361.50s]  And this is such a huge step in your journey to kind of do like online programming and game development and stuff.
[9362.50s -> 9363.50s]  This is a huge deal.
[9372.55s -> 9373.55s]  I kind of want to see what happens if you kill five.
[9374.98s -> 9375.98s]  Do I get to kill five more?
[9379.72s -> 9389.90s]  Three more.
[9390.90s -> 9401.55s]  I did it, I did it, I did it.
[9402.55s -> 9403.55s]  I win.
[9408.70s -> 9409.70s]  I don't want to play Sudoku.
[9411.13s -> 9416.21s]  The Exder?
[9418.73s -> 9419.73s]  Too close.
[9420.73s -> 9421.73s]  I'm a person.
[9421.73s -> 9423.22s]  I thought I was a plane.
[9424.22s -> 9425.66s]  No, no, no, no, no.
[9425.66s -> 9426.66s]  What are you thinking about, Jeremy?
[9426.66s -> 9427.66s]  You're the Exder.
[9429.02s -> 9432.02s]  Part man, part machine, part plane, part boat, part person.
[9433.02s -> 9440.79s]  Holy shit.
[9441.79s -> 9443.42s]  This is awesome.
[9444.42s -> 9445.42s]  This is actually really cool.
[9446.42s -> 9453.78s]  This is the most elaborate Mario Maker level I've ever seen.
[9454.78s -> 9458.90s]  I cannot aim that, by the way.
[9459.90s -> 9462.74s]  How do I transform?
[9488.62s -> 9489.62s]  Did that, did Mario...
[9489.62s -> 9491.75s]  Did we do Ninja 2?
[9492.75s -> 9494.57s]  I don't believe we did.
[9503.36s -> 9504.36s]  It kind of looks like Bart.
[9509.44s -> 9510.44s]  Mario Homer.
[9517.25s -> 9518.25s]  I love that sound.
[9521.54s -> 9522.54s]  Did I just kill a bird?
[9523.54s -> 9524.54s]  What did I knock down?
[9524.54s -> 9525.54s]  What the hell was that?
[9532.54s -> 9533.54s]  I'm hurting animals in the tree.
[9533.54s -> 9534.54s]  I don't want to do that.
[9543.64s -> 9545.64s]  All cartoon music comes from the same place, doesn't it?
[9545.64s -> 9546.64s]  Do I have health?
[9549.22s -> 9551.22s]  No, I'm not going to do a Simpsons impression.
[9551.22s -> 9552.22s]  No, I'm not because it's going to get on the list.
[9553.22s -> 9554.22s]  Nope, not happening.
[9556.30s -> 9558.30s]  I will never do a Homer Simpson impression again.
[9559.30s -> 9560.30s]  It's not going to happen.
[9560.30s -> 9561.30s]  I already know it's going to happen.
[9561.30s -> 9562.30s]  You don't.
[9562.30s -> 9563.30s]  I'm not going to do it.
[9563.30s -> 9567.54s]  I'm not going to do any of the Simpsons.
[9567.54s -> 9569.17s]  Nope.
[9569.17s -> 9570.17s]  I'm not doing it.
[9577.81s -> 9579.81s]  There's 500 million off the debt.
[9579.81s -> 9583.61s]  What?
[9583.61s -> 9593.72s]  I'm not doing it for anything less than that.
[9593.72s -> 9594.72s]  No deal.
[9594.72s -> 9595.72s]  Yeah, I've seen a lot of no deals.
[9595.72s -> 9600.86s]  It's not going to happen.
[9600.86s -> 9602.86s]  Hey, when does the Cuphead DLC come out?
[9602.86s -> 9605.64s]  Isn't that soon?
[9607.78s -> 9609.72s]  Springtime or something?
[9609.72s -> 9610.72s]  Pull, pull, pull.
[9613.30s -> 9615.31s]  Ow!
[9615.31s -> 9616.31s]  What the fuck?
[9616.31s -> 9618.31s]  Why did pausing that just...
[9618.31s -> 9620.31s]  Oh my god, I can't pause the game.
[9621.81s -> 9626.22s]  Why did it do that?
[9626.22s -> 9627.22s]  Holy shit.
[9627.22s -> 9628.91s]  Okay.
[9628.91s -> 9630.34s]  I'm going to...
[9630.34s -> 9633.34s]  Can I just confirm that that was what was happening?
[9633.34s -> 9636.67s]  Turn your volume down.
[9636.67s -> 9638.67s]  I want to confirm that that was happening.
[9638.67s -> 9639.91s]  Turn your volume down.
[9639.91s -> 9644.99s]  Yep.
[9644.99s -> 9645.99s]  Oh my god.
[9645.99s -> 9652.78s]  All right, straw poll.
[9652.78s -> 9655.27s]  Let's see if you guys really want that.
[9655.27s -> 9671.59s]  I'll do it for 500 million.
[9671.59s -> 9679.67s]  Okay, Simpsons impression for 500 million off debt.
[9679.67s -> 9680.67s]  It's just yes or no.
[9680.67s -> 9703.12s]  The only way I'm going to do it.
[9703.12s -> 9704.12s]  Are you serious?
[9704.12s -> 9705.42s]  Are you kidding me?
[9705.42s -> 9709.11s]  This is the easiest bet I've ever made.
[9709.11s -> 9711.11s]  This is the easiest amount of...
[9711.11s -> 9713.11s]  Of course I'm going to do this.
[9713.11s -> 9715.11s]  500 million.
[9715.11s -> 9716.11s]  Are you guys kidding me?
[9716.11s -> 9720.55s]  Wow.
[9720.55s -> 9721.55s]  This is a freebie.
[9721.55s -> 9732.69s]  You guys are throwing me a meatball here.
[9732.69s -> 9733.69s]  500 million off the debt.
[9733.69s -> 9734.69s]  This is 60%.
[9734.69s -> 9736.69s]  This is an absolute majority.
[9736.69s -> 9742.66s]  Okay.
[9742.66s -> 9743.90s]  All right.
[9743.90s -> 9744.90s]  Here we go.
[9744.90s -> 9745.90s]  We better take 500 million off.
[9745.90s -> 9746.90s]  Here we go.
[9746.90s -> 9755.46s]  Here we go.
[9755.46s -> 9761.31s]  Is there a certain line you want me to say as Homer?
[9761.31s -> 9770.53s]  Say, eat my shorts as Homer.
[9770.53s -> 9771.53s]  That's not what he says.
[9771.53s -> 9774.11s]  Okay.
[9777.51s -> 9778.51s]  Mmm.
[9778.51s -> 9781.38s]  Beer.
[9781.38s -> 9782.38s]  Mmm.
[9782.38s -> 9784.38s]  Duff.
[9784.38s -> 9787.07s]  And let me tell you something, Bart.
[9787.07s -> 9790.07s]  Can you go in the fridge and get me an ice cold duff beer?
[9790.07s -> 9791.31s]  Mmm.
[9791.31s -> 9792.31s]  Donut.
[9792.31s -> 9793.31s]  Mmm.
[9793.31s -> 9794.31s]  Beer.
[9794.31s -> 9796.45s]  Sure thing, Dad.
[9796.45s -> 9799.39s]  I'll go and get you a beer.
[9799.39s -> 9801.40s]  Waka waka.
[9801.40s -> 9802.40s]  Oh, Homer.
[9802.40s -> 9806.40s]  I don't like the fact that you're drinking so much on a weekday.
[9806.40s -> 9808.02s]  Much.
[9808.02s -> 9813.46s]  Can you just stop complaining and stop telling me to do things?
[9813.46s -> 9814.76s]  Mmm.
[9814.76s -> 9815.76s]  Beer.
[9815.76s -> 9816.76s]  Oh, Marty.
[9816.76s -> 9825.04s]  You need breakfast?
[9825.04s -> 9826.04s]  Mmm.
[9826.04s -> 9827.04s]  Breakfast.
[9827.04s -> 9834.81s]  It's me, Lisa, coming down the stairs.
[9834.81s -> 9841.62s]  Well, hi to the holy neighbors.
[9841.62s -> 9842.62s]  I'm in your window.
[9842.62s -> 9844.62s]  I'll take the 500 million, please.
[9844.62s -> 9859.61s]  I'll take 500 million removed from the fucking debt.
[9859.61s -> 9860.98s]  Where's Bart?
[9860.98s -> 9861.98s]  He already ran in.
[9861.98s -> 9862.98s]  He skated on a skateboard.
[9862.98s -> 9863.98s]  He didn't ollie.
[9866.11s -> 9871.02s]  Double or nothing for the entire Griffin family?
[9871.02s -> 9874.32s]  Are we taking a billion off if I do the whole Griffin family?
[9874.32s -> 9876.69s]  The entire Griffin family?
[9876.69s -> 9877.69s]  One billion?
[9877.69s -> 9878.69s]  Are we kidding?
[9889.72s -> 9890.72s]  Okay.
[9890.72s -> 9891.72s]  Hold on.
[9891.72s -> 9899.38s]  I'm going to be wiping my fucking debt clean right now.
[9899.38s -> 9905.51s]  He does this for free all the time, but I have banned it completely as of four days ago.
[9905.51s -> 9906.51s]  It has to be all of them.
[9906.51s -> 9913.51s]  You have to say welcome to Germacraft as Peter.
[9913.51s -> 9914.51s]  Oh my.
[9914.51s -> 9916.84s]  Okay, fine.
[9916.84s -> 9927.89s]  I will do a welcome to Germacraft as the entire Griffin family for a double or nothing for
[9927.89s -> 9928.89s]  a billion off.
[9928.89s -> 9937.00s]  I'll read the copypasta in the whole Griffin family.
[9937.00s -> 9939.00s]  That like little paragraph section.
[9939.00s -> 9949.16s]  I'm going to do a poll.
[9949.16s -> 9950.16s]  Griffin family.
[9950.16s -> 9957.65s]  Never in a fucking million years, like 10, 20 years ago, would I have thought that I'd
[9957.65s -> 9965.34s]  be sitting in a chair here going back and forth arguing with 11,000 people about removing
[9965.34s -> 9971.95s]  debt from my fucking name to do like the entire Griffin family in a Germacraft copypasta.
[9971.95s -> 9976.95s]  Like, this was not even possible in my brain like even five years ago.
[9976.95s -> 9982.05s]  You have to do it with the face cam on.
[9982.05s -> 9983.05s]  Face cam on on no deal.
[9983.05s -> 9991.34s]  Griffin family, Germacraft, copypasta for another 500 million, right?
[9991.34s -> 9999.11s]  So that would be a total one billion with cam on.
[9999.11s -> 10004.32s]  Okay.
[10004.32s -> 10005.32s]  Fuck.
[10005.32s -> 10006.32s]  It's going to be so embarrassing.
[10006.32s -> 10010.18s]  This is going to be embarrassing, but whatever.
[10010.18s -> 10011.18s]  It's worth it.
[10011.18s -> 10026.44s]  I need the copypasta.
[10026.44s -> 10034.66s]  Who's it?
[10034.66s -> 10036.54s]  Who's in there?
[10036.54s -> 10037.54s]  It's Chris, Meg.
[10037.54s -> 10039.54s]  Oh, I don't know how to do it.
[10039.54s -> 10042.93s]  Oh, this is 80% of the, okay.
[10042.93s -> 10044.87s]  There it is.
[10044.87s -> 10045.87s]  Let me get this like ready.
[10045.87s -> 10048.39s]  Okay.
[10048.39s -> 10049.39s]  Let me get on cam.
[10049.39s -> 10060.68s]  All right.
[10060.68s -> 10061.92s]  This is, this is, this is good.
[10061.92s -> 10065.02s]  You ready?
[10065.02s -> 10066.02s]  All right.
[10066.02s -> 10067.45s]  So we start with, we're going to go Peter.
[10067.45s -> 10069.45s]  Let's do like the family guy kind of list here.
[10069.45s -> 10076.64s]  Peter, Brian, Stewie, Chris, and then you have Lois and Meg.
[10076.64s -> 10079.22s]  Okay.
[10079.22s -> 10081.10s]  You need to do Joe.
[10081.10s -> 10083.60s]  Joe's not part of the Griffin family.
[10083.60s -> 10087.49s]  Quagmire is not a Griffin.
[10087.49s -> 10089.49s]  Quagmire is in the show family guy.
[10089.49s -> 10090.49s]  He's not a Griffin.
[10090.49s -> 10093.75s]  You have to add Joe and Quagmire.
[10093.75s -> 10097.08s]  Joe and Quagmire have to be in there.
[10097.08s -> 10098.08s]  Okay.
[10098.08s -> 10100.41s]  Okay.
[10100.41s -> 10101.41s]  That's it.
[10101.41s -> 10102.41s]  That's it.
[10102.41s -> 10104.54s]  All right.
[10104.54s -> 10105.98s]  I gotta like write, I have to write this down.
[10105.98s -> 10116.40s]  There's Peter, then Brian, Stewie, then Joe, Quagmire.
[10116.40s -> 10119.43s]  Oh, Chris is in there.
[10119.43s -> 10123.44s]  There's a lot of fucking people I have to do.
[10123.44s -> 10127.90s]  Chris, Peter, Brian, Stewie, Chris, Joe, Quagmire.
[10127.90s -> 10131.53s]  Lois, Meg.
[10131.53s -> 10135.47s]  I'm only gonna be able to read two words per person.
[10135.47s -> 10142.58s]  Okay.
[10142.58s -> 10145.84s]  There's too many people on this list.
[10145.84s -> 10148.94s]  Principal, no, no.
[10148.94s -> 10149.94s]  We have too many people.
[10149.94s -> 10151.94s]  The copypasta's like a paragraph.
[10151.94s -> 10155.37s]  I'm gonna be like, I, it's not gonna work.
[10155.37s -> 10158.25s]  Do the whole thing per person?
[10158.25s -> 10161.38s]  That was not part of the deal.
[10161.38s -> 10164.88s]  The whole thing per person, excuse me.
[10164.88s -> 10168.77s]  That was not part of the deal.
[10168.77s -> 10172.16s]  It was, if I'm doing the whole thing per person,
[10172.16s -> 10175.16s]  I am removing like three people on this list,
[10175.16s -> 10178.16s]  because they're not, I'm removing people not in the Griffin family.
[10178.16s -> 10181.87s]  Griffin family, Germacraft copypasta.
[10181.87s -> 10185.88s]  That's not Joe Griffin, it's not Quagmire Griffin.
[10185.88s -> 10190.38s]  Okay.
[10190.38s -> 10195.50s]  Peter, Brian, Stewie, Chris, Lois, and Meg.
[10195.50s -> 10209.07s]  Remove Meg for Quagmire.
[10209.07s -> 10211.07s]  That's gonna have to come down to a vote.
[10211.07s -> 10215.23s]  That's gonna have to come down to a vote.
[10215.23s -> 10220.93s]  Paul, no, Meg for Joe.
[10220.93s -> 10222.42s]  All right.
[10222.42s -> 10224.79s]  If you want me to replace Meg so bad,
[10224.79s -> 10227.79s]  we're gonna replace Meg with Joe or Quagmire.
[10227.79s -> 10228.79s]  You better get it right.
[10228.79s -> 10232.49s]  I keep like changing colors.
[10232.49s -> 10238.66s]  You see that?
[10238.66s -> 10245.53s]  That was weird.
[10245.53s -> 10246.53s]  All right.
[10246.53s -> 10249.14s]  New straw poll.
[10249.14s -> 10253.38s]  Okay.
[10253.38s -> 10256.38s]  Can I have like the family guy background music on,
[10256.38s -> 10258.38s]  or is that gonna get in trouble for that?
[10258.38s -> 10260.01s]  That might make it hard to do.
[10260.01s -> 10261.01s]  I might like laugh.
[10261.01s -> 10272.36s]  That like, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[10272.36s -> 10273.36s]  Okay.
[10273.36s -> 10279.66s]  Who am I replacing Meg with, Joe or Quagmire?
[10279.66s -> 10282.15s]  Oh, I fucking hate this.
[10282.15s -> 10286.12s]  You have to know I did this for a reason.
[10286.12s -> 10303.68s]  Wow.
[10303.68s -> 10304.68s]  Wow.
[10304.68s -> 10312.78s]  This is surprising.
[10312.78s -> 10325.20s]  There's a midi version?
[10325.20s -> 10334.35s]  Joe won by a lot.
[10334.35s -> 10336.35s]  Can I get like a family guy midi version?
[10336.35s -> 10372.80s]  Family guy, family guy midi.
[10372.80s -> 10376.17s]  I can't do this.
[10376.17s -> 10378.92s]  That's so fucked up.
[10378.92s -> 10380.92s]  I don't think I can do that.
[10380.92s -> 10401.42s]  That's gonna be so hard to do.
[10401.42s -> 10402.73s]  Give me the pasta.
[10402.73s -> 10404.73s]  Joe won by shitload.
[10404.73s -> 10409.45s]  So, okay.
[10409.45s -> 10410.45s]  Okay, here we go.
[10410.45s -> 10415.27s]  Eh.
[10415.27s -> 10416.27s]  Eh.
[10416.27s -> 10417.27s]  Eh.
[10417.27s -> 10419.73s]  Eh.
[10419.73s -> 10420.73s]  Lois.
[10420.73s -> 10421.73s]  Eh.
[10421.73s -> 10422.73s]  All right.
[10422.73s -> 10423.73s]  I think I'm ready to try.
[10423.73s -> 10426.89s]  Here we go.
[10426.89s -> 10427.89s]  We start with Peter.
[10427.89s -> 10435.06s]  Family Guy is brought to you by...
[10435.06s -> 10438.45s]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[10438.45s -> 10441.45s]  Welcome to episode one of Germacraft.
[10441.45s -> 10443.45s]  The series where I play Minecraft.
[10443.45s -> 10445.45s]  This is going to be a single player let's play.
[10445.45s -> 10449.45s]  And when I say let's play, I use that term pretty loosely.
[10449.45s -> 10451.45s]  Because I am an idiot in this game.
[10451.45s -> 10453.45s]  You're gonna see lots of fails.
[10453.45s -> 10455.45s]  You're gonna see lots of triumphs.
[10455.45s -> 10456.45s]  At least I'm hoping.
[10456.45s -> 10458.45s]  So grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee.
[10458.45s -> 10460.45s]  Hot cup of cocoa.
[10460.45s -> 10462.45s]  I got apple cider right here.
[10462.45s -> 10463.45s]  Freshly brewed.
[10463.45s -> 10464.45s]  Let me take a sip.
[10464.45s -> 10465.45s]  That's good cider.
[10465.45s -> 10470.40s]  Okay.
[10470.40s -> 10472.60s]  Got it.
[10472.60s -> 10474.35s]  Got it.
[10474.35s -> 10475.35s]  Got it.
[10475.35s -> 10477.74s]  Who's next?
[10477.74s -> 10482.63s]  Okay, Brian.
[10482.63s -> 10483.63s]  Get over here.
[10483.63s -> 10485.32s]  Let me see that coffee pasta again.
[10485.32s -> 10486.32s]  Peter.

[13776.22s -> 13782.76s]  Yeah, I've ever watched cowboy be Bop. I have yeah
[13786.52s -> 13791.00s]  This is a good. It's a good animated television series about
[13792.52s -> 13795.36s]  Wisdom
[13795.36s -> 13809.17s]  Wisdom boy. I'm on easy. I don't care. I love a one
[13810.75s -> 13813.82s]  Wisdom. Oh, it's one of these
[13814.56s -> 13821.52s]  That is to put pieces in here. No, I'm done. Don't I don't play it. I'm up on that one
[13828.87s -> 13835.22s]  Quarterback, yep, John Madden. No, that's not John Madden
[13835.78s -> 13838.82s]  It's a different John who is that John Elway
[13839.66s -> 13853.90s]  Like team New England. I'll be New England. I want to hit start on New England. No, I don't fucking San Francisco. What?
[13865.02s -> 13885.80s]  Shit. Oh nice. All right. We're gonna do a bomb pass every single play. That's not past that's dive pass
[13885.88s -> 13902.68s]  Must be a B. Okay, try that again
[13910.64s -> 13912.20s]  intentional grounding
[13912.20s -> 13923.93s]  What's happening? I'm European. Oh, just just American things. I got it. That's the first down
[13937.04s -> 13950.30s]  Who's the ball? You know, I play every football game. I
[13951.10s -> 13952.94s]  Okay, tell me if you guys did this shit, too
[13952.94s -> 13958.31s]  So my brother and I used to play like Madden all the time and I was never very good
[13958.99s -> 13965.65s]  But how I always played is I would always just cycle because you could only control one person at a time
[13965.95s -> 13968.97s]  So what I would do is I was cycled to every single person
[13968.97s -> 13975.29s]  So let's say it was a to cycle to your defensive line or your your tailgater or whatever they are
[13975.77s -> 13980.93s]  I would cycle to every single person and hit the dive button immediately when the indicator went over their head
[13981.29s -> 13983.29s]  So it would just be like
[13983.97s -> 13988.17s]  And maybe I would hit the person that had the ball sometimes and it would be infuriating for him
[13988.77s -> 13994.74s]  so it would just be
[13994.74s -> 13998.80s]  Select dive select dive select dive select dive and it works
[13999.08s -> 14002.08s]  But if it doesn't work, it's a guaranteed run back or touch down
[14002.24s -> 14008.36s]  So my brother would win a lot of the times we played Madden like 80 plus points to like six
[14008.56s -> 14019.98s]  So I was never very good at it. Oh
[14022.10s -> 14033.73s]  First down 20 yards just bomb it into the end zone
[14034.29s -> 14055.29s]  Got it. That's a cool story, bro. All right time the person up is 17 days. Oh touchdown touchdown touchdown touchdown. Oh
[14056.37s -> 14059.51s]  Your nose still wheezing. No, I'm fine
[14061.69s -> 14063.69s]  17 how many seconds is that?
[14067.48s -> 14071.78s]  That's a touchdown if I've ever seen one touchdown if I've ever seen one
[14072.38s -> 14078.94s]  Go Patriots go Patriots that's terrible this year and like Tom Brady left
[14079.30s -> 14083.30s]  So like what are we gonna do now? What are we gonna do now? Like Brady's gone, man?
[14083.84s -> 14085.84s]  Brace fucking gone
[14089.48s -> 14101.54s]  He's gone man
[14101.54s -> 14118.33s]  Muscle, who do I want to be to be the base? Just bald. I don't know. What should I be the night? Oh
[14127.72s -> 14137.31s]  It holy shit this game awesome, I don't know what character am I okay, I think I'm green guy
[14142.38s -> 14145.77s]  Who's out there who is that? Hey
[14147.91s -> 14150.93s]  Did a little kid somebody shoot something in here?
[14151.49s -> 14163.44s]  You got a smash ball. Are you serious? You think I'm watching down there? What the fuck?
[14163.70s -> 14202.20s]  God damn it. I tried for a big play going on top rope fortnight dancing. I got the smash ball this time
[14202.72s -> 14223.32s]  Throw an axe at him. I got another one. Oh, he's done. I taunt towards the camera every time
[14224.06s -> 14241.04s]  Yeah, I got him. Don't let him tag in don't let him tag in fuck. This is grandpa Homer a grandpa Simpson
[14241.46s -> 14258.71s]  Shit, he got the pill just avoid him run away. I gotta tag out tag out tag out tag. Come on, dude
[14259.23s -> 14285.37s]  Tag out tag out tag out. I think I broke it. They break it. Oh, I can see we're good
[14291.55s -> 14306.13s]  Alright, what do you guys think? What should we do? How about bowling? Yeah, definitely play macross. All right
[14306.13s -> 14318.39s]  I will after this ball. I always go to seven pound ball lighter. There's more room to move
[14319.21s -> 14342.51s]  That's how you get a guaranteed strike right down though Mario seven ball. It has to be lighter for your scrawny arms. That's fine
[14342.65s -> 14347.37s]  It's okay. I yeah, I got I got smaller. I can I get big arms. Are you talking about?
[14359.38s -> 14362.34s]  Well, what if I go I'm gonna roll it down really really slow
[14362.98s -> 14366.50s]  See if I can get a diaper strike

[14696.54s -> 14711.65s]  Back to the future. This looks like the real game. I believe it is
[14712.25s -> 14735.05s]  Never even seen these movies start to finish. I've seen like him ride on a hoverboard
[14735.61s -> 14745.74s]  that I've never seen I've

[14778.03s -> 14790.42s]  Okay, this game is not good. It's very bad. Even it was the official game. It's very bad. He's on the reddit shelf
[14790.42s -> 14800.45s]  I have to play it this control. Okay

[15005.38s -> 15015.34s]  Caterpillars don't eat other bugs. Don't they eat like that? They're decaying bodies or something by the goonies
[15015.34s -> 15026.97s]  It's just like the bumper sticker where it just shows how many people are in that person's family on the back of their like window. I
[15032.79s -> 15059.51s]  Got one bomb. This looks like the official game not blow them up. I blow them up. I was too late

[15259.35s -> 15271.11s]  Actually, that's pissing me off. Why is there an HP meter in a shmup?
[15273.20s -> 15276.83s]  Because this is an anime dude, you're watching second episode
[15277.55s -> 15296.95s]  Why do you think this is a shmup late TF2? I think it's on 547. That's gonna fight the second boss

[18704.86s -> 18710.66s]  So it was like four and a half billion or something so

[18721.80s -> 18733.13s]  We're gonna make sure that's updated still four billion. It should be updated three point five billion, okay?
[18733.13s -> 18751.46s]  That means it was four point five billion. That's the update what the fuck it was five point six billion before you kidding me
