[0.31s -> 15.06s]  Hey everybody, it's Jerma here with a Pax East compilation video.
[15.06s -> 20.06s]  First of all, Pax East was amazing, and a special shout out to everybody I met there.
[20.06s -> 24.06s]  All the people I hung out with, all the cool dudes that really came out to say hello.
[24.06s -> 26.06s]  It was amazing, a lot of fun, a lot of friends.
[26.06s -> 31.06s]  And I just want to say that a lot of this footage is a little bit on the low quality side.
[31.06s -> 34.06s]  I wasn't going there as really press, but I wanted to get a couple iPhone interviews.
[34.06s -> 37.06s]  I wanted to do some Sony Handicam stuff, so keep that in mind.
[37.06s -> 40.06s]  The audio isn't really the best you'll ever hear in your life.
[40.06s -> 43.30s]  And I have about maybe enough footage for one more video.
[43.30s -> 45.30s]  I'm not really sure about that, but we shall see.
[45.30s -> 48.30s]  But enjoy this video, guys, and I'll see you all soon.
[48.30s -> 51.30s]  So take care, everybody.
[51.30s -> 55.86s]  We're on our way to the PC free play right now.
[55.86s -> 58.86s]  PC free play is where it's at.
[58.86s -> 63.86s]  Am I right? PC free play is where it's at, right?
[64.86s -> 67.86s]  Come on, we've got to get a chant going.
[67.86s -> 71.17s]  Get to the group, it's way back there.
[71.17s -> 74.47s]  Hey, you know, we're going to go play PC free play right now.
[74.47s -> 77.47s]  What do you think you're doing?
[77.47s -> 78.47s]  Sorry.
[78.47s -> 81.47s]  This is PC free play. You know what we're going to play at PC free play?
[81.47s -> 83.47s]  I'll tell you what we're going to play.
[83.47s -> 85.47s]  We're going to play Team Fortress 2.
[85.47s -> 92.47s]  Team Fortress 2. Team Fortress 2. Team Fortress 2. Team Fortress 2. Team Fortress 2. Team Fortress 2.
[92.47s -> 95.47s]  Oh, everyone fucking hates me.
[95.47s -> 98.47s]  How do we even get downstairs?
[102.47s -> 104.47s]  Right there, that's where we're going, boys and girls.
[104.47s -> 107.47s]  We're going to the PC free play room.
[107.47s -> 109.47s]  Wait, hold on a second. Hold on.
[109.47s -> 111.47s]  Hey, is that...
[111.47s -> 115.47s]  This down here is, I think that's like the tabletop stuff.
[118.47s -> 120.47s]  It's fun. It's a fun time.
[121.47s -> 123.47s]  It's going this way, going this way.
[127.29s -> 130.46s]  Oh, it's PCs. I wonder how much energy this is using.
[130.46s -> 135.46s]  Like, how much electricity is powering all these computers? Oh my god.
[135.46s -> 139.60s]  We're over here with Dan from StealthMachines.com.
[139.60s -> 145.85s]  This is a crazy PC building company.
[145.85s -> 148.85s]  Basically, our company started with $200.
[148.85s -> 154.93s]  It was eight years ago, and all we did was use the word machines.
[154.93s -> 157.81s]  We started to market. We're getting our name out there.
[157.81s -> 159.81s]  Besides, it's just for your gamers.
[159.81s -> 164.07s]  We have a 10-year warranty and almost a perfect record.
[164.07s -> 167.27s]  10-year warranty.
[167.27s -> 170.27s]  PC builders, they have like a three-year warranty,
[170.27s -> 175.11s]  but you have to pay for a 10-year warranty.
[175.11s -> 177.11s]  That's insane.
[177.11s -> 180.74s]  This is the first time I just walked over here and had this stuff,
[180.74s -> 187.67s]  and it was like, oh shit.
[187.67s -> 189.67s]  No matter where you are, they'll get you.
[189.67s -> 195.52s]  You can hand deliver it.
[195.52s -> 199.55s]  Take a look at this beast.
[199.55s -> 203.98s]  This is the fastest AMD graphics card on the planet right now.
[203.98s -> 206.98s]  It's the AMD Radeon 7970.
[206.98s -> 208.98s]  Over three gigs of RAM.
[208.98s -> 210.98s]  Oh my god, there it is.
[210.98s -> 212.98s]  Look at that alien spaceship.
[212.98s -> 237.54s]  Guys, I'm here with D, who is the creative head,
[237.54s -> 241.54s]  and the guy responsible, I guess you could say, for Dust and Elysium table.
[241.54s -> 243.54s]  It's an Xbox Live arcade release.
[243.54s -> 246.54s]  Coming out, no release date yet, but he's still working on it.
[246.54s -> 249.54s]  He's done everything for this game.
[249.54s -> 251.54s]  So I want you to introduce yourself in the audience
[251.54s -> 252.54s]  and tell them what you're doing here.
[252.54s -> 253.54s]  It's amazing.
[253.54s -> 256.54s]  All right, so I come at this as an artist.
[256.54s -> 258.54s]  You know, my background is in animation.
[258.54s -> 260.54s]  And I wanted to work on a program.
[260.54s -> 263.54s]  So I decided, you know, I'll pick up XNA and C Sharp.
[263.54s -> 266.54s]  And before I knew it, I started making a game.
[266.54s -> 268.54s]  And Microsoft showed interest in it.
[268.54s -> 272.54s]  And now here I am, almost four years later, showing up.
[272.54s -> 273.54s]  In fact, it's great.
[273.54s -> 275.54s]  Four years of work.
[275.54s -> 276.54s]  So let me get this.
[276.54s -> 280.35s]  You are doing all the artwork, programming.
[280.35s -> 282.72s]  What have you not done on the XNA?
[282.72s -> 283.72s]  I'm not handling the audio.
[283.72s -> 285.72s]  I've got people coming and using.
[285.72s -> 287.72s]  But I'm doing all the design.
[287.72s -> 288.72s]  I'm doing all this work.
[288.72s -> 290.72s]  It's crazy.
[290.72s -> 292.72s]  But it's a dream come true.
[292.72s -> 296.72s]  Anything you can give us about when it potentially might be coming out?
[296.72s -> 299.72s]  Well, the game will definitely be finished this year.
[299.72s -> 302.72s]  You know, it's up to the publisher as well when to release it.
[302.72s -> 303.72s]  But it'll be done this year.
[303.72s -> 304.72s]  And it's close.
[304.72s -> 305.72s]  It's close.
[305.72s -> 306.72s]  Unbelievable work you're doing here.
[306.72s -> 307.72s]  I can't wait to see what you've got in store.
[307.72s -> 308.72s]  Thanks a lot.
[308.72s -> 310.72s]  Thank you, guys.
[310.72s -> 313.72s]  Well, we found it.
[313.72s -> 316.72s]  The Team Fortress 2 store.
[316.72s -> 318.72s]  Look at all that stuff.
[318.72s -> 324.02s]  I'm about to instantly transform my outfit into one of these.
[324.02s -> 326.02s]  Absolutely.
[326.02s -> 357.37s]  Axis, bitch!
[357.37s -> 358.37s]  Burger Boy.
[358.37s -> 359.37s]  Axis.
[359.37s -> 360.37s]  Yeah!
[360.37s -> 363.25s]  So Burger Boy, I was talking to you the other day.
[363.25s -> 364.25s]  That was a spy.
[364.25s -> 365.25s]  That was a spy.
[365.25s -> 366.25s]  Spy!
