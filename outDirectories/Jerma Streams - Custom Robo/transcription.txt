[437.40s -> 438.95s]  Prison
[438.95s -> 441.99s]  I'm going to prison son, and I don't want you to know
[456.15s -> 462.50s]  Dad
[462.50s -> 464.18s]  That was insane
[464.18s -> 469.14s]  Why would you do that in front teaching you kid all this fucked up shit wake up?
[470.22s -> 478.58s]  But you got wax in your ears. I said wake up and get out of bed. What the hell am I in a hospital?
[480.94s -> 484.94s]  Honestly, just because you don't work doesn't mean you can sleep your day away
[485.50s -> 489.29s]  Do you even know what time it is? It's past noon
[489.85s -> 495.77s]  You were supposed to start streaming 31 minutes ago. Don't you have a job interview?
[496.25s -> 502.94s]  What was that place again stale horse? You need that job if you're gonna pay your rent
[503.42s -> 506.74s]  Now get up and get that job
[507.62s -> 512.81s]  You heard me get out of bed and drag your lazy behind to that stale horse interview
[515.26s -> 519.58s]  Geez good morning to you too, and it's not steel horse. It's steel hearts
[521.37s -> 523.53s]  Whatever just get up and get out of bed
[524.17s -> 526.15s]  You need that job
[526.15s -> 533.86s]  Oh and good luck. What kind of room is this?
[534.42s -> 542.31s]  This is a hospital. I still have the watch on. Well, these are interesting clothes
[544.36s -> 548.12s]  Holy shit. This is awesome. I don't even I wasn't expecting this to be running
[553.00s -> 556.36s]  Half-life, uh to get two open door sounds, right? Whatever someone's to say whatever
[558.01s -> 568.94s]  Wait, did I do it? Can I do anything in here? Can I touch anything? No new part data, please come back. It's kingdom hearts
[574.06s -> 577.26s]  Yeah, this this character exists in the kingdom hearts universe somewhere
[578.46s -> 584.76s]  Look at you all gussied up and ready to go. Now. Don't you come back here without a job?
[585.56s -> 587.94s]  I've been worried about you
[587.94s -> 590.10s]  And not just because of the rent, you know
[590.90s -> 593.27s]  You worried about me?
[593.27s -> 598.47s]  Well, we've all been worried not a single word from your father for years and then that letter come
[600.31s -> 604.87s]  It must have been a terrible shock to find out about his death like that. Just a lettering of will
[606.70s -> 608.31s]  uh
[608.31s -> 610.31s]  Did he crash his car?
[610.39s -> 612.15s]  eight years ago
[612.15s -> 616.76s]  Just curious
[616.76s -> 621.08s]  Telling me to become a robo commander. I know it's weird, but I hadn't seen him for so long
[621.64s -> 626.66s]  In fact, the only thing I really remember of oh my dad
[627.30s -> 629.30s]  Is the watch he gave me
[630.23s -> 632.23s]  I don't remember anything else
[632.31s -> 634.23s]  That's beside the point
[634.23s -> 636.39s]  I need to worry about the future now
[637.11s -> 641.91s]  That's certainly true. You've been living off your family savings for years
[642.79s -> 645.03s]  It's about time. You got a job
[645.03s -> 652.36s]  I'll do my best. In fact, I'll do whatever it takes to become a commander
[653.14s -> 656.17s]  Isn't neat
[656.17s -> 662.39s]  That's what your father wanted. Isn't it? At least that's what it said in his will
[664.01s -> 669.05s]  You're a good boy, you could go for any job you wanted but you don't want to let your father down
[670.01s -> 674.25s]  But you could go for any what I mean, you're a good boy. You could go for any job you want
[674.97s -> 677.53s]  But since when does being a good boy
[678.15s -> 680.15s]  Represent skills in a field
[680.65s -> 684.92s]  You go to a job interview
[684.92s -> 691.24s]  Now, what would you say your skills are? Well, i'm a good boy. Holy shit. That's the first one we've heard today. Come on in
[692.04s -> 695.88s]  We only have bad boys here. They all have tattoos all over the place
[695.96s -> 701.40s]  They have neck tattoos and they wear leather jackets to work. Oh, thank goodness. We've got a good boy. Finally
[701.88s -> 710.31s]  Yeah, I wonder why did my dad want me to become a commander?
[711.43s -> 715.27s]  I don't know why it was so important to him, but I'll give it a try at least, huh?
[717.72s -> 722.28s]  I like to see his last wish fulfilled a commander, huh? Yeah, I can do it
[724.41s -> 730.79s]  Uh, what's a commander do commander's a person who controls a custom robo
[732.82s -> 736.18s]  No, i'm afraid. I just don't follow that. Could you say it a little less green?
[737.82s -> 741.90s]  Anyway, don't think of me as a landlady. Think of me as a friend
[742.62s -> 744.79s]  If you need any advice just ask
[746.02s -> 753.90s]  Thanks. Well, then you go get that job and become a commander at stale horse. I'll do my best
[755.08s -> 756.44s]  Bye
[756.44s -> 763.67s]  What just happened to the game?
[772.49s -> 774.49s]  Nobody move nobody move
[774.65s -> 790.01s]  Nobody move. All right, is this the stale horse?
[790.65s -> 795.78s]  One day i'm gonna join the police squad and use my robo to fight crime
[796.50s -> 798.33s]  What are they doing?
[798.33s -> 803.78s]  I'm gonna keep practicing with my custom robo until i'm a big and strong bounty hunter
[804.66s -> 807.03s]  these kids in timeout
[808.39s -> 809.67s]  This looks like
[809.67s -> 811.27s]  future timeout
[811.27s -> 813.27s]  I don't get what are the what are they doing?
[818.01s -> 822.49s]  My wife told me the kids would need a robo. They were going to get anywhere in this world, but
[823.21s -> 826.65s]  Those things are expensive. I have my needs too, you know
[829.46s -> 834.42s]  Hi there neighbor job hunting again. It must be rough out there. Good luck
[840.89s -> 846.30s]  It's not burning. All right, we have to go to the stale horse. This is like pokemon
[849.00s -> 853.72s]  Wait just a second. I said you could treat me like a friend. That doesn't mean you can go poking around in my office
[856.36s -> 858.36s]  Right left right left right left
[859.00s -> 866.12s]  Where is this place?
[866.12s -> 881.69s]  Whoa. Oh, it's doing it automatically. Okay, that's good. Oh, here comes the first tutorial battle
[882.33s -> 886.68s]  What do I talk to first? All right, let's talk to you
[886.92s -> 891.43s]  All right, what do you want? All right, you're here for the interview
[892.31s -> 896.94s]  You see that scary looking guy over there. He's the guy you want to talk to he's the boss
[900.87s -> 907.94s]  Okay
[907.94s -> 910.26s]  I how do you i mean, what's this one? That's weird
[911.14s -> 913.46s]  It sounds like a trash compactor that's on a person talking
[915.21s -> 918.33s]  So you're here for the interview, right? Let's get this over with
[920.12s -> 922.12s]  You ever work a bounty hunter before?
[924.04s -> 925.64s]  Of course
[925.64s -> 927.64s]  No, it's my first time
[928.28s -> 933.48s]  I think I have no it's my first time of course. No, it's my first time
[934.28s -> 936.28s]  I think I have no it's my first time
[941.29s -> 943.29s]  And don't be cocky
[943.69s -> 947.45s]  Look forget it moving on next question. You got a robo
[948.79s -> 954.63s]  I lost it. I can't afford I lost it. I can't afford one. You got a spare. I can't I lost it
[954.63s -> 956.63s]  I can't afford you got a spare
[966.63s -> 969.67s]  That was perfect. I don't have to do this one
[969.67s -> 971.67s]  That's just how the guy laughs. That's okay
[973.66s -> 977.13s]  You're funny
[977.13s -> 980.65s]  Anyway, i'm sorry, but I need an experienced guy with his own robo
[981.37s -> 983.99s]  I just can't afford to hire an amateur
[984.63s -> 986.87s]  My watch is going to turn out to be a robot, right?
[987.43s -> 991.43s]  What are you talking about? We can't afford to hire anyone who's not an amateur
[993.59s -> 997.91s]  Besides i'm being the new guy. I'm sick of being the new guy. We need someone I can push around
[999.11s -> 1004.47s]  I'm sick of dealing with the chief on my own. What'd I tell you about these bad boys?
[1005.82s -> 1007.82s]  Hey, just a quick question
[1008.06s -> 1010.14s]  You wouldn't happen to be a good boy, would you?
[1013.37s -> 1016.28s]  You got something to say
[1016.28s -> 1019.32s]  Listen, even if we did hire you we don't have a robo or a spare
[1020.04s -> 1022.36s]  Oh, you'll need to get on get one
[1024.98s -> 1026.58s]  Make a good impression
[1026.58s -> 1028.26s]  What should I say?

[1036.63s -> 1041.35s]  Oh great. I'll call you when we're going after the sinister spatula and his bake sale bandits
[1042.07s -> 1045.27s]  None of this really matters though
[1045.51s -> 1049.19s]  The simple fact is we don't have the money to buy you a robo
[1052.22s -> 1054.22s]  And so that's why I can't hire you
[1054.30s -> 1056.98s]  Does he have a booger hanging out of his nose?
[1058.66s -> 1060.34s]  Oh, but but but

[1206.97s -> 1212.33s]  I think of her like an older sister sorta. I mean not really but oh now that that's weird now
[1212.97s -> 1214.73s]  That got weird
[1214.73s -> 1220.97s]  That got weird really weird. In fact like weird where that just made me uncomfortable being in the same seat
[1221.86s -> 1223.06s]  As you
[1223.06s -> 1225.37s]  But you were not sitting together
[1226.01s -> 1228.01s]  Don't try anything funny with her. You got it
[1229.18s -> 1230.87s]  Yeah, I got it
[1230.87s -> 1232.87s]  I make no promises
[1233.11s -> 1234.87s]  What do you mean funny
[1234.87s -> 1242.50s]  You know like hiding behind a wall and then jumping out and scaring her stuff like that
[1247.61s -> 1261.38s]  Oh that this is that they're in like thought battle. This is a fucking banger. It's those bottom feeders
[1262.66s -> 1264.42s]  Don't be mean
[1264.42s -> 1266.42s]  We're bounty hunters
[1267.06s -> 1272.14s]  Whatever you all pray off the lowest of the low you bounty hunters are all bottom feeders
[1272.78s -> 1278.62s]  Don't give me any static. We're here on an assignment. Oh, yeah, nobody here asked you for your help
[1279.67s -> 1283.54s]  I did
[1283.54s -> 1286.26s]  Uh for a bunch of grill marks on her legs
[1287.93s -> 1289.93s]  Well, what we got this covered
[1291.78s -> 1293.78s]  Looking good as always linda
[1294.76s -> 1296.62s]  Thanks harry
[1296.62s -> 1298.86s]  I need you to take care of those crooks right away
[1299.58s -> 1307.08s]  They're after ray01 our newest robo. It's still in development and it was top secret
[1308.60s -> 1310.60s]  Top secret. Oh, that's so cool
[1312.89s -> 1316.01s]  Yes, but there's no telling what could happen if it were to fall into the wrong hands
[1316.97s -> 1320.49s]  We can't let them take it with your skills you should be able to take care of them easily
[1322.10s -> 1327.46s]  But that's what we're doing. They're stealing our newest robo. One can't be too careful
[1329.56s -> 1332.68s]  That's right. You heard her. You can't be too careful and that's where we come in
[1332.76s -> 1336.28s]  I can't imagine if my window was open and like my neighbor was listening to this
[1341.21s -> 1345.69s]  I'm realizing this now
[1347.10s -> 1349.10s]  Hearing this out of context this person
[1350.06s -> 1354.22s]  You know what this you know what? I would be happy with it completely. You know why i'm writing a screenplay
[1354.94s -> 1356.94s]  I'm like doing a screenplay thing
[1357.50s -> 1361.66s]  Holy shit that guy's up there acting. Oh, he's he's right. He's writing a screenplay. That's definitely what that is
[1361.90s -> 1363.74s]  What else could the fuck that be?
[1363.74s -> 1368.54s]  There's nothing else that makes sense with that that situation at all. That's a pretty cool screenplay that guy's doing
[1371.24s -> 1375.08s]  We're gonna get involved but you know, you can't always rely on the police squad. Some jobs are just too important
[1378.42s -> 1379.78s]  Okay, then
[1379.78s -> 1381.78s]  You wait here try not to get in the way
[1382.26s -> 1386.18s]  You just watch linda, but you just watch linda. This one's for you
[1389.11s -> 1396.74s]  Good luck harry burglar why are the burglars wear those on their faces?
[1397.38s -> 1402.74s]  What do you want? You don't look like one of those police squad guns
[1404.02s -> 1406.02s]  My name's harry and i'm a bounty hunter
[1407.77s -> 1408.97s]  bounty hunter
[1408.97s -> 1410.41s]  You mean one of those
[1410.41s -> 1412.97s]  mercenary scumbags i'm just doing the other guy
[1414.04s -> 1416.52s]  So what do you want with me? You want me to fight or something?
[1417.24s -> 1420.38s]  bingo
[1420.70s -> 1422.94s]  Man do I feel sorry for you? I feel like this is me
[1425.67s -> 1428.15s]  He just said I feel like this is me talking
[1430.66s -> 1433.38s]  And man, I feel sorry for you. Your luck just ran out
[1434.82s -> 1439.46s]  For the love of linda. I harry of the steel hearts will be your undoing
[1440.18s -> 1444.02s]  wait a minute steel hearts
[1444.58s -> 1446.90s]  Oh, you mean those bottom feeders?
[1448.10s -> 1450.98s]  We're not bottom feeders. We're bounty hunters
[1454.95s -> 1456.55s]  I'm counting on you harry
[1456.55s -> 1462.55s]  Please hurry up with the tutorial and protect ray one and teach him how to press a already for god's sake
[1463.69s -> 1466.25s]  Uh, we're trying our hardest, you know
[1471.14s -> 1473.70s]  Um, excuse me
[1473.86s -> 1475.37s]  What is it?
[1475.37s -> 1478.89s]  What are those people doing?
[1478.89s -> 1481.21s]  What are they doing? They're they're fighting of course
[1482.68s -> 1485.32s]  Fighting you expect me to believe they're fighting
[1487.24s -> 1489.48s]  Uh, yes
[1489.56s -> 1491.56s]  But they're not doing anything
[1491.80s -> 1493.80s]  They're just staring at each other
[1496.07s -> 1499.27s]  No, no, no, no, they're using their custom robos to fight. Can't you tell?
[1500.23s -> 1502.47s]  Huh?
[1502.47s -> 1505.03s]  Well, I don't see any custom robo anywhere
[1506.58s -> 1509.06s]  That's because they're fighting inside the holo. Museum
[1510.02s -> 1512.02s]  a holo zam of course
[1513.30s -> 1515.27s]  holo zam
[1515.27s -> 1520.78s]  It is a thought battle. Yes. A holo zam is a fighting arena created in a digital environment
[1521.34s -> 1524.97s]  The custom robos fight within that virtual battlefield
[1525.61s -> 1529.62s]  Hmm. I think I get it. Please stop spinning it though
[1531.70s -> 1533.30s]  Oh, but yes
[1533.38s -> 1536.87s]  Where's rayo one?
[1536.87s -> 1539.75s]  I haven't seen any robos at all since we got here
[1540.87s -> 1545.43s]  Well, the custom robo remains in cube form until it is released into the holo zam to
[1546.55s -> 1548.73s]  Wait, you're teasing me, aren't you?
[1549.29s -> 1551.37s]  Surely, you know all of this already
[1552.17s -> 1555.35s]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I've never really seen though
[1556.07s -> 1559.67s]  You do work with harry. Don't you aren't you one of the steel hearts bounty hunters?
[1560.31s -> 1562.31s]  uh
[1562.39s -> 1565.99s]  Steam coming out of my I mean, yeah, i'm with the steel hearts. I think
[1566.63s -> 1569.48s]  Out of my ears
[1569.48s -> 1572.52s]  Well, then get to work go fight some burglars. What are you what are we paying you for?
[1579.72s -> 1582.60s]  Take a look harry and the police are having a tough time. You should be helping them
[1583.56s -> 1586.76s]  Uh, why don't I just go punch one of these guys in the stomach?
[1588.23s -> 1589.67s]  What are you talking about?
[1589.67s -> 1593.59s]  I mean aren't these burglars right now completely engrossed in their digital world
[1593.59s -> 1596.63s]  What if I just went and stabbed them all in the back one by one?
[1597.43s -> 1600.06s]  No, no, no, that's uh
[1600.38s -> 1602.38s]  I mean you could try I don't think it'll work
[1603.75s -> 1605.75s]  Yeah, yeah, I guess i'll help
[1611.85s -> 1613.85s]  All right, is there one that's not fighting
[1615.42s -> 1617.42s]  This guy here is pretty strong
[1621.06s -> 1624.82s]  Just pick one of these up and overhead hit him in the head with it. What's I don't understand the problem
[1627.13s -> 1629.13s]  Harry i'm here to help you
[1629.37s -> 1631.61s]  What did you?
[1631.61s -> 1637.34s]  Ah
[1637.34s -> 1644.71s]  Oh, wait, there's the cube. Oh you idiot. Don't talk to me when i'm fighting. I lost the fight because of you
[1646.81s -> 1649.13s]  Yeah, that's what you get for not paying attention
[1650.01s -> 1653.93s]  Oh, I think I hurt myself. Oh shoot. They're gonna swipe that new robo
[1655.13s -> 1657.37s]  harry, uh
[1657.93s -> 1660.25s]  Why don't we just shoot him? Let me help
[1660.97s -> 1663.77s]  But you don't even have a robo
[1663.77s -> 1668.09s]  Oh, yeah, that's right. Should I punch him in the face? I could punch him right now in his face
[1669.19s -> 1671.67s]  Let me borrow your robo. I'll use it to fight
[1672.39s -> 1678.09s]  It won't work. I've already done my eye scan registration. I'm the only one who could use it
[1679.13s -> 1682.49s]  Eye scan registration. What the heck? I got no time to explain
[1684.68s -> 1686.60s]  Whoa, can I go now?
[1686.60s -> 1690.12s]  I mean if you two were just gonna fight amongst yourselves, you really don't meet me here. Do you?
[1691.08s -> 1696.44s]  And even the crooks are making fun of us. If only you had a robo and a scrumptious cake
[1697.90s -> 1699.99s]  robo
[1699.99s -> 1701.99s]  Hmm. I guess I take this one
[1706.33s -> 1708.65s]  What's this box?
[1708.65s -> 1709.85s]  Huh?
[1709.85s -> 1712.28s]  There's a button on the back
[1712.28s -> 1714.52s]  Better press it. I better forget it
[1716.20s -> 1721.26s]  I'm gonna let me check. Maybe all right. Let me show you a cool trick. I'm gonna smash this off my head
[1721.26s -> 1726.46s]  It's gonna crumple up like a can but i'm gonna do the bar thing where i'm trying to describe
[1727.10s -> 1729.74s]  The thing I want to describe to you guys, but it's hard to do it right now
[1733.91s -> 1735.91s]  Well, it's starting to buzz
[1736.23s -> 1738.79s]  Well there did you just do an eye scan registration?
[1739.94s -> 1742.26s]  You still haven't told me what that even is
[1743.06s -> 1749.11s]  Eye scan registration is when you look directly into the robo's sensor while pressing that button
[1749.27s -> 1750.47s]  Okay
[1750.47s -> 1752.47s]  But there's no time to explain that
[1752.55s -> 1756.94s]  The point is you're now the only one who can control that robo
[1757.58s -> 1760.71s]  Hurry and die
[1761.03s -> 1764.30s]  This is a robo
[1764.30s -> 1767.26s]  Shut up and do as I say beat that burglar
[1767.82s -> 1778.33s]  Think about a kid you should think about this kid
[1778.41s -> 1782.09s]  You sure you want to go up against me even though you never used to cut the robo for your entire life
[1782.33s -> 1785.53s]  This wise guy thinks he's too tough just because he hasn't got lucky against me
[1786.81s -> 1789.45s]  Captain he's definitely not going to be lucky against you
[1790.33s -> 1792.33s]  And make sure to be in the mess hall for dinner
[1795.22s -> 1798.02s]  Now listen your robo shoot from the robo cannon on the left side
[1798.66s -> 1807.48s]  Nobody knows what that is
[1807.48s -> 1810.44s]  I'm not even gonna say what it is. Oh, yeah, there's a lot of new people here
[1811.32s -> 1813.32s]  Oh, whatever you'll figure it out
[1819.03s -> 1822.31s]  All right, your robo will shoot out from the robo cannon on the left side
[1823.11s -> 1828.14s]  Robo cannon this machine that shoots out the robo cube
[1829.45s -> 1834.41s]  The robo cube transforms once it's been fired. All right, so I shoot it out of a cannon and it turns into a robot
[1835.37s -> 1841.53s]  Custom robo 101. What is this link?
[1844.87s -> 1847.35s]  All right. This is like this is whatever i'll show it
[1848.57s -> 1851.85s]  This is better. I gotta make sure this is not the chuck-e-cheese kiss image
[1853.19s -> 1855.19s]  Okay, because i've all right. It's not
[1863.24s -> 1876.47s]  What the fuck?
[1876.47s -> 1877.99s]  There you go. I got it for you
[1877.99s -> 1886.10s]  All right, when the robo cube counts down to zero it completes its transformation. Do I actually run around the robo?
[1886.66s -> 1888.66s]  Press the b button to fire your gun
[1889.38s -> 1894.98s]  Use your gun to blam blam blam your enemy's energy down to zero and you win use the control stick to zoom zoom
[1895.38s -> 1898.02s]  Zoom around and use the b button to fire
[1899.54s -> 1901.54s]  All right, i'm just gonna do it
[1903.21s -> 1905.21s]  Fights made him weak you'll do just
[1906.33s -> 1908.33s]  Boom zoom zoom bang bang
[1912.63s -> 1916.23s]  Buzzwords
[1916.23s -> 1919.56s]  Enemy. Oh shit
[1919.80s -> 1921.64s]  All right
[1921.64s -> 1928.15s]  That's that's the enemy
[1928.23s -> 1934.28s]  Paints parts and model types. All right. Hold on customized robo. What do I have?
[1935.51s -> 1937.51s]  Oh, he's so cool looking. This is ray01
[1938.55s -> 1940.55s]  fighter model basic gun
[1940.87s -> 1947.37s]  Okay, come with basic capabilities fires three rounds at a time aerial and ground shots are the same medium range
[1948.87s -> 1952.15s]  standard standard bomb standard pod standard everything I don't have any I
[1953.72s -> 1955.72s]  Oh shit, okay
[1955.80s -> 1957.80s]  There's 13 pages of guns
[1960.20s -> 1962.60s]  I'm sorry that was that that just came up
[1963.32s -> 1965.11s]  All right, let's go
[1965.11s -> 1971.64s]  It's an american game
[1971.64s -> 1973.64s]  What do you mean american game?
[1973.88s -> 1976.63s]  All right, ready three wait with the what?
[1978.70s -> 1980.78s]  You you have to throw them out like dice
[1983.03s -> 1985.27s]  How do I get out of the cube? How do I get out of the cube?
[1985.91s -> 1995.83s]  Holy shit, this is actually pretty cool
[1998.39s -> 2004.76s]  Reborning zoom zoom zoom around
[2005.48s -> 2010.65s]  I don't have a zoom zoom zoom. Oh, he's gonna beat me
[2011.37s -> 2014.38s]  Do I have any other buttons or weapons?
[2014.62s -> 2020.70s]  Wait, he's he's
[2020.70s -> 2022.38s]  Oh wait, there's a double jump
[2022.38s -> 2027.03s]  Wait a minute. All right, I get it. Oh
[2027.83s -> 2029.91s]  That's missile. He hit himself his own missile
[2030.71s -> 2033.14s]  Use the terrain to my advantage
[2037.43s -> 2043.94s]  mashing buttons
[2043.94s -> 2045.94s]  Oh, that was a dash move. That was like falco
[2046.66s -> 2053.96s]  All right. That was cool. That was pretty fun. That was just the basic tutorial
[2054.92s -> 2056.92s]  That just he landed on his neck
[2063.05s -> 2068.38s]  Good work. Oh one of the police guys just blew it go over there and clean up his mess
[2068.38s -> 2072.54s]  Yes
[2075.26s -> 2077.96s]  I like the soundtrack
[2077.96s -> 2080.44s]  Oh, come on. I knocked that loser out. Don't deserve a break
[2081.16s -> 2083.62s]  All right. Listen up that guy ought to be worn out from his fight, too
[2083.70s -> 2085.70s]  If you listen to my advice, you should be able to beat him
[2085.94s -> 2090.50s]  Use the r button to fire bombs and use the l button to launch an attack pod
[2091.99s -> 2093.11s]  Okay
[2093.11s -> 2096.07s]  Firing your pod doesn't stop you from being able to move freely
[2098.25s -> 2103.45s]  Run at your opponent and keep on pressing the l button use the r button to drop the bombs and use the l button to blast
[2103.45s -> 2104.89s]  the pod
[2104.89s -> 2106.17s]  Sticky bombs
[2106.17s -> 2115.67s]  One more thing if you get caught in your own pod blast you're gonna take damage drop the bomb blast the pod
[2121.93s -> 2129.77s]  Enemy we just look at it pod bomb
[2136.33s -> 2140.89s]  Just easy enough. Just throw just just drop bombs. All right. I'm still confused about this part
[2141.61s -> 2144.95s]  Have to tap a
[2144.95s -> 2159.46s]  Why does he have an advantage?
[2159.46s -> 2164.20s]  Wait, oh
[2165.00s -> 2173.77s]  Well, they're kind of like homing missiles in a way
[2174.41s -> 2182.28s]  Why would you come over here? My fucking specialty is mid-range dude
[2183.08s -> 2193.66s]  Shoot him in the air too, right?
[2193.66s -> 2209.61s]  Fuck him down and then do it this game's cool than I thought it was gonna be
[2210.09s -> 2211.21s]  Uh-huh
[2211.21s -> 2213.19s]  Okay class
[2213.19s -> 2215.19s]  Can we can I get an apology now?
[2221.30s -> 2222.98s]  No
[2222.98s -> 2224.18s]  Why?
[2224.18s -> 2229.86s]  That's just kind of hard hit
[2229.86s -> 2240.26s]  Right there boom
[2240.26s -> 2250.18s]  What this game's worse than evolva. What are you talking about? No. No, it is not
[2250.50s -> 2253.14s]  It is not even close by the way that game wasn't even bad
[2253.30s -> 2256.02s]  That game was actually kind of fun. You guys just wouldn't give it a chance
[2259.59s -> 2261.59s]  Not bad for an amateur
[2266.52s -> 2269.32s]  This is way better. I mean this game is like a classic video game
[2270.12s -> 2272.94s]  We lost another cop take the next guy
[2276.55s -> 2279.67s]  Up up the police squad ain't nothing still I break a sweat
[2280.55s -> 2282.89s]  He looks pretty tired. If you listen to my advice you should be able to win
[2283.53s -> 2290.01s]  Try using the a button or jump you can do I know i'm going to neelix again. I know but it's it's fits for me
[2290.01s -> 2291.45s]  I don't know why
[2291.45s -> 2294.33s]  No, it doesn't fit this character at all though. I just it's what i'm doing
[2295.13s -> 2297.77s]  You can do an air dash twice I learned that already
[2298.89s -> 2301.29s]  You can charge with the x button. Yeah
[2302.97s -> 2305.48s]  Nice. All right. I get it
[2305.48s -> 2307.48s]  Rubble can't move when it's down
[2307.64s -> 2310.60s]  Use the a button to jump and the x button to charge crash
[2311.94s -> 2315.85s]  Got it. Got it
[2315.85s -> 2319.61s]  You only do a charge when you're on the ground. It won't work if you're in the air jump and crash
[2322.28s -> 2324.92s]  Volva 2 waiting room that game doesn't exist
[2326.41s -> 2327.61s]  happen
[2327.61s -> 2335.69s]  And these people
[2335.69s -> 2341.83s]  Make it I can't make a game. All right, get out
[2342.39s -> 2350.73s]  I'm just gonna overwhelm this guy. All right. He has a much longer countdown than me doesn't he? No, he doesn't
[2353.91s -> 2355.91s]  Yeah. Yeah. Yo, yo, yo
[2356.15s -> 2357.93s]  Yo
[2357.93s -> 2359.29s]  Why does that happen?
[2359.29s -> 2371.61s]  Look at that juggle
[2371.61s -> 2375.83s]  Look at that around the corner. That's a mario 64 battle team shit
[2376.71s -> 2403.16s]  How would you get that close?
[2403.16s -> 2405.16s]  Hey, yo, this game's fun
[2405.24s -> 2407.69s]  I really like this
[2407.69s -> 2410.81s]  And this is just this is the tutorial got a lot more to see
[2411.37s -> 2418.25s]  With 13 pages of guns, you now have access to the twin flank pod f
[2418.81s -> 2424.50s]  Go visit a parts generator
[2424.50s -> 2426.50s]  You want rayo one and smash?
[2428.41s -> 2437.30s]  Um, not not really no. Well, I think you still need some work, but well done
[2437.86s -> 2446.89s]  He was an assist. Yeah. I mean, I I don't know him enough. I have to get to know this character and see if I like it
[2447.45s -> 2454.03s]  Before you take them on go over to the parts generator and get yourself some new parts parts generator
[2454.99s -> 2458.03s]  I'll explain later just stand in front of him press a you'll get a new part
[2458.67s -> 2460.81s]  One you can use right away
[2460.81s -> 2462.81s]  Okay, go in front of that machine and press a
[2462.89s -> 2464.91s]  Yes, go press a
[2464.91s -> 2470.19s]  Thanks. You could have said that in one panel. We've got a twin flank pod f
[2473.20s -> 2475.20s]  Nice. Okay. So what does that mean?
[2477.13s -> 2482.78s]  What happened here? I turned my back on one second and all my men get wiped out. I'm worn out, but we need that robo
[2483.96s -> 2491.55s]  Last guy's exhausted. This should be as easy as a scrumptious cake still you'd better listen to my advice
[2492.35s -> 2496.51s]  Use the control stick to change the direction of the robo cube when it launches
[2499.98s -> 2504.24s]  When the cube hits the ground the number shows how long it needs to charge for the transformation
[2504.78s -> 2509.00s]  To speed up the charge tap the controller buttons rapidly. Okay
[2509.72s -> 2513.39s]  If you transform before your opponent you get to attack first
[2513.55s -> 2518.03s]  So I didn't know that use the control stick to aim the robo cannon where you want to shoot and then tap the buttons. Got it
[2518.75s -> 2522.83s]  Got it
[2522.83s -> 2524.83s]  smash mash mash mash
[2525.07s -> 2532.38s]  What why are you linking with this? What is it? Why the I don't get this?
[2540.00s -> 2546.08s]  This is shitty picture of me too like right about to start laughing with like eyes. I hate that photo
[2550.11s -> 2550.91s]  turn
[2550.91s -> 2555.39s]  Tappity zoom zoom jumpity jump bang bang boom boom clam crash
[2559.82s -> 2562.22s]  To the porn ads love it. Can we talk about that for a second?
[2563.63s -> 2566.35s]  I was in a second porn ad. Is that what you get?
[2566.91s -> 2568.91s]  Because I know there was one before
[2571.44s -> 2580.08s]  Is this number two? Yes. Okay for those of you that have no idea and i'm not gonna i'm not gonna link it
[2580.08s -> 2582.64s]  I don't want to give any attention to it. It's like why would I do that?
[2583.20s -> 2584.08s]  uh
[2584.08s -> 2586.08s]  Somebody used for some reason
[2586.64s -> 2588.92s]  people use this
[2588.92s -> 2593.40s]  Me laughing and talking like six years ago or five years ago, whatever this was
[2594.57s -> 2598.25s]  And they put it on top of like it's me interacting with a girl online
[2599.10s -> 2602.78s]  It's uh, it's like an interact with a girl fake. I didn't do it. Like they just use it
[2604.49s -> 2606.81s]  I I have I don't even I have no idea
[2608.48s -> 2610.48s]  Yes, it's real and this has happened twice
[2611.12s -> 2622.00s]  This is not a one-time occurrence
[2624.92s -> 2629.47s]  It's ridiculous
[2629.63s -> 2631.79s]  Somebody all right. Somebody said are you soon?
[2633.13s -> 2635.13s]  uh, okay, hi
[2635.13s -> 2639.93s]  Okay, let me let's go over the amount of effort that it would take for me to get into a legal battle with a porn ad
[2641.93s -> 2646.97s]  Well, i'm not gonna what should I lawyer up? All right, i'm gonna lawyer up. Let's do I don't what do you want me to do?
[2647.37s -> 2651.90s]  I don't even know where this company is bay. I don't know who this I don't know anything about these people
[2657.88s -> 2660.52s]  It's not worth it for me to do that
[2664.80s -> 2667.76s]  I'm just waiting for the day that I get hit up by somebody that I like
[2668.16s -> 2670.80s]  Haven't talked to in probably five ten years or something like that
[2672.11s -> 2674.11s]  Hey, dude, are you like doing porn now?
[2675.24s -> 2679.24s]  What's this? What's this ad? Are you what's going on here? Did you see this and i'm like, yeah
[2680.28s -> 2682.04s]  I should say yeah
[2682.04s -> 2683.00s]  Yeah
[2683.00s -> 2686.12s]  Is that all right with you?
[2686.12s -> 2687.69s]  uh
[2687.69s -> 2690.81s]  Um, yeah, I I just was care. That's you. Yeah, it's me
[2691.77s -> 2694.89s]  Okay, man. I do. Yeah. Hope you having a hope you having a good you have any kids or anything?
[2695.37s -> 2697.13s]  No, no, do you have any kids?
[2697.13s -> 2702.25s]  Yeah, four. Cool. How are they? They're good. All right. See you again in 10 years when you ask me another question
[2705.07s -> 2705.95s]  Hi
[2705.95s -> 2715.34s]  But I have to customize plus if it's not based in the u.s. But yeah, it's just
[2715.90s -> 2717.90s]  And I look i'll be honest with you
[2718.49s -> 2728.28s]  It doesn't that doesn't I don't care. I really just don't care. All right, where's that new thing basic?
[2729.08s -> 2731.60s]  standard
[2731.60s -> 2744.12s]  Where is it? Is it already attached? What was it called? It's a pod. Oh, it's the pod
[2749.84s -> 2751.84s]  One flank pod. Oh wait mash
[2754.12s -> 2756.12s]  I wasn't mashing. I wasn't mashing. It's okay
[2756.68s -> 2766.20s]  Yes, it was but no, I don't care really. I don't
[2768.01s -> 2770.97s]  Look, okay. Let's let's go over this if it was like
[2771.77s -> 2773.27s]  something
[2773.27s -> 2780.20s]  Egregiously awful that I was in like you guys all know I have the green screen shit and the green screen shit is literally
[2780.28s -> 2782.28s]  I don't care what anyone does with it
[2783.32s -> 2785.00s]  Except
[2785.00s -> 2786.44s]  you know
[2786.44s -> 2790.92s]  There's some things that I would not be comfortable with my image being put up, right?
[2792.91s -> 2795.72s]  It's very few things
[2795.72s -> 2798.28s]  But let's be honest. I think you all know what they could be
[2798.84s -> 2811.88s]  That's how you juggle
[2814.52s -> 2816.20s]  Wait, I can aim this
[2816.20s -> 2822.08s]  Holy shit, this changes everything
[2822.72s -> 2828.03s]  It's got like little mice
[2828.03s -> 2844.97s]  What about a penis enlargement pill advertisement? No, I don't care. You have access to the three-way gun
[2853.55s -> 2857.31s]  Omega low that's actually funny. Okay. Yeah, I I don't
[2859.58s -> 2862.30s]  there's a line right and
[2863.02s -> 2867.66s]  The line when you if you cross the line, you know, you're crossing the line
[2868.56s -> 2871.84s]  It's not hard to determine that I don't think so
[2874.08s -> 2884.27s]  There's a very clear line. I think of what like all right, don't fucking do that. Wait, who's this?
[2887.31s -> 2888.99s]  God, when did you get here?
[2888.99s -> 2892.54s]  Why did you hit your head
[2892.54s -> 2895.34s]  Listen, the reason you got beaten is because you're not properly trained
[2895.90s -> 2898.65s]  I've said it before and i'll say it again
[2898.65s -> 2900.65s]  You need to get out of the mercenary business
[2902.04s -> 2906.36s]  Start studying get yourself a class a license and join the police squad
[2907.72s -> 2912.12s]  Oh, don't start on that again. I told you I wouldn't be caught dead in one of those tacky uniforms
[2913.61s -> 2920.20s]  Look, i'll pay all your exam fees. It won't cost you a dime. What do you say?
[2921.00s -> 2924.78s]  It's not about the money. I just don't like studying
[2928.03s -> 2933.47s]  Captain mira, we've sent the criminals over to hq. We ought to head back to their ourselves
[2934.03s -> 2944.20s]  I can't believe we needed help from those bounty hunters. I'll make sure that all police squad members presented this travesty
[2945.18s -> 2947.18s]  We'll hit the training room hard
[2947.18s -> 2949.29s]  After mira
[2949.29s -> 2951.29s]  We should get back to hq
[2951.29s -> 2960.48s]  I'll be waiting at the front gate. See you harry. I'll be working late. So don't wait up for me
[2961.36s -> 2963.50s]  Get some sleep
[2963.50s -> 2965.82s]  Keep yourself warm when you go to bed
[2966.89s -> 2968.49s]  You don't want to catch cold
[2968.49s -> 2977.45s]  stop
[2977.45s -> 2981.21s]  Stop, stop. No, stop. You're ruining her for me. Stop, please
[2981.85s -> 2985.52s]  That's not what it's ended up here in my head. That's not what she sounds like. Stop doing that
[2990.65s -> 2992.65s]  You always treat me like i'm a kid
[2993.05s -> 2998.41s]  Is that your brother? Is that your older sister? Is that your girlfriend?
[3002.06s -> 3004.36s]  Is that your older sister?
[3004.44s -> 3009.24s]  Yeah, jeez. She's always acting so macho. It really freaks me out. There are nothing's in your business
[3015.45s -> 3018.46s]  Harry are you hurt?
[3019.42s -> 3023.53s]  Linda yeah, i'm okay. I never felt better
[3024.80s -> 3028.48s]  By the way harry this person's weird. I would not want to talk to this person. It'd be weird
[3030.14s -> 3034.46s]  Look, i'm i'm i don't do this in in real conversations with people
[3035.56s -> 3041.40s]  When i'm like one-on-one, i'm not like hello. Yes kim. We're gonna go get a nice delicious steak
[3041.48s -> 3043.48s]  I don't i don't i don't do that
[3043.48s -> 3048.04s]  Um, and I do sometimes I do sometimes all right a few times i've done that
[3049.63s -> 3051.71s]  I yell up the stairs and i'm like honey
[3052.35s -> 3056.67s]  Um, can you come down here for a few minutes? I do this all the time. Fuck. I do this all the time
[3057.39s -> 3062.12s]  But not that often not every sentence maybe like once every few days
[3067.82s -> 3071.10s]  Well, he's got what it takes to be a great commander someday still. He's got a long way to go
[3071.74s -> 3077.04s]  Oh, I totally agree linda. Oh, you're so observant like that. It's incredible. Yeah
[3077.44s -> 3082.16s]  It's not like he got the best robot that exists ray. Oh one. It's like the most strong robot
[3082.80s -> 3084.24s]  You gave him like a uh, yeah
[3084.24s -> 3089.76s]  I I have a regular default hearthstone deck and he has every legendary in the game. That's not no, it's fair
[3090.40s -> 3096.28s]  great commander sheesh
[3096.28s -> 3104.20s]  Harry i've got an idea. How about letting him use our new robot ray? Oh one
[3105.08s -> 3108.54s]  He adapted it pretty quickly
[3108.54s -> 3112.88s]  And i'd like to gather some data on his usage and control. Can we can we talk about hearthstone for one second?
[3112.88s -> 3114.88s]  I know everyone's gonna be like
[3116.46s -> 3118.46s]  I played it recently
[3118.62s -> 3120.78s]  And holy shit how much that game has changed
[3122.73s -> 3125.45s]  I was doing like the solo adventure stuff and I was like, oh, this is kind of fun
[3125.45s -> 3127.45s]  I remember when they they did this stuff
[3127.45s -> 3129.48s]  the amount of like
[3129.48s -> 3135.88s]  Throw up eight minions on the board wipe eight minions throw up eight minions on the board add plus four plus four to all minions
[3135.96s -> 3140.75s]  Wipe all minions eight minions on the board. When did that start happening?
[3143.28s -> 3144.72s]  No one asked
[3144.72s -> 3151.29s]  Yeah, but I I decided I wanted to talk about it. It was three years ago
[3151.85s -> 3155.37s]  What happened? Oh, that's probably the last time I really tried
[3161.13s -> 3163.13s]  You have no free will. Oh, yeah
[3164.76s -> 3166.43s]  Are you sure?
[3166.43s -> 3171.07s]  Are you sure it's not you that doesn't have and there he goes purged
[3173.68s -> 3177.61s]  Who has the power here?
[3177.61s -> 3179.13s]  MonkaS
[3179.13s -> 3182.49s]  Wait, this guy he's not really he's not with us. He came by today looking for work
[3183.05s -> 3188.60s]  The chief doesn't want to hire him though
[3188.60s -> 3191.72s]  Oh really i'll recommend that earnest hire him myself then
[3192.44s -> 3196.80s]  I can't wait to see his face so we can go ahead and take this ray-01
[3197.76s -> 3200.00s]  Sure, go ahead. Of course. He's already registered
[3200.64s -> 3204.00s]  So he can only use the one that he's the only one they can use it time to read
[3205.69s -> 3209.93s]  Yeah, I know dang if only I had made eye contact with it first. Wait, what?
[3215.92s -> 3217.96s]  That's weird
[3217.96s -> 3222.76s]  It's an eye scan. So what it it just it attaches to anyone that it looks at its eyes first
[3223.48s -> 3228.16s]  So what if a baby looks at it first?
[3229.37s -> 3231.61s]  Like an infant just happens to match eyes
[3232.17s -> 3240.24s]  Is that is that it we have to wait till that kid gets old enough to like think?
[3241.76s -> 3247.71s]  We just put it in the shelf good link good link omega lull good link
[3248.27s -> 3253.95s]  Of course, you always say that it's always good link omega lull and then I click it and my nose is stretched by 20
[3260.16s -> 3262.40s]  What is it? Did you did you photo? Who is this?
[3264.35s -> 3278.94s]  What is this? No, i'm okay. I'm done. I'm done. I'm playing the game
[3279.34s -> 3284.62s]  I'm not showing i'm not showing anymore like chuckie cheese and I i'm not doing that anymore. We're done with that
[3285.98s -> 3287.98s]  Oh another great question. I completely forgot to ask
[3288.72s -> 3290.72s]  Oh, uh, nothing. Come on. Tell your name
[3293.32s -> 3295.34s]  Oh, what's my name?
[3295.34s -> 3297.34s]  Well, it's um
[3306.43s -> 3308.43s]  What is it not jacks
[3311.56s -> 3314.96s]  paul
[3314.96s -> 3316.96s]  Oh, my name is paul in all capitals
[3319.29s -> 3328.88s]  It's important. Otherwise this lowercase is not my name paul. Oh one. It's weird that
[3329.60s -> 3333.56s]  Oh, I should make
[3333.56s -> 3336.76s]  I should make a cheeto
[3337.48s -> 3359.66s]  Oh
[3359.66s -> 3370.92s]  Dale, huh? I'm lynda. Nice to meet you. Don't worry dale. I'll talk to the chief. Oh fuck. It's lowercase d. Whatever
[3371.48s -> 3374.80s]  Ain't that great dale and it sums
[3375.84s -> 3376.80s]  Oh
[3376.80s -> 3378.80s]  right
[3379.12s -> 3382.33s]  By the way lynda, do you want to grab some lunch?
[3383.36s -> 3388.88s]  Oh, i'm sorry. I've just got too much work to do the whole lab's a mess. Thanks to those burglars
[3389.60s -> 3393.12s]  Besides your work here is done. Don't you have to get back to the steel hearts office?
[3393.92s -> 3399.39s]  I'll give earnest a call and ask him about dale later. You know what I mean?
[3400.59s -> 3403.18s]  See you later harry
[3403.18s -> 3412.97s]  Load the saves. No, I can't load a save state. I don't have a save state. Don't tell me that exists by the way
[3417.74s -> 3422.14s]  She knows i'm a busy guy. She's got a lot of class that linda is awesome
[3424.33s -> 3426.59s]  Poor women or something
[3426.59s -> 3431.66s]  I almost forgot dale. I was going to tell you about the parts generator
[3432.20s -> 3435.63s]  Me that machine i've got one in my apartment
[3437.90s -> 3438.78s]  What
[3438.78s -> 3441.72s]  What's a parts generator doing in your apartment?
[3442.20s -> 3446.12s]  You don't have a custom robo. You don't even know what if well they you don't know what they are
[3446.60s -> 3451.45s]  It belonged to my dad. I never knew what it was supposed to do. It just kind of sits there
[3452.67s -> 3456.19s]  Yeah, well, I guess i'll just have to skip that accidentally
[3456.19s -> 3462.88s]  Anyways, I was about to explain about the parts generator registers new part data into your robo cube when you buy a robo
[3463.28s -> 3465.28s]  It only comes with the standard parts
[3465.60s -> 3473.56s]  You won't have access to a lot of parts if you don't collect enough battle experience when a robo gathers battle experience
[3473.72s -> 3480.62s]  The internal computer records the battle information when the parts generator automatically reads the record and gives you the new part
[3480.94s -> 3488.25s]  Any new parts you get you can use them in the next battle. Whatever parts you want to use
[3488.89s -> 3496.20s]  Is up to you. You can customize as much as you'd like. That's it for the hard stuff
[3496.44s -> 3500.94s]  It's best to check the parts generator after every battle your opponent
[3502.04s -> 3505.72s]  Sorry your opponent's not gonna wait for you while you make a quick run to the parts generator
[3507.10s -> 3514.03s]  Obviously, you can't slip out during a battle. That's why it's best to check with the parts generator after every battle
[3514.68s -> 3517.80s]  Even if you forget to check after a battle, you can still get the part afterwards
[3518.54s -> 3523.02s]  However, if it's just waiting for you to pick it up, why not go get it as soon as possible?
[3523.66s -> 3527.82s]  The more parts the more you can customize your robo. It gives you I look I know how to I'd get it
[3528.14s -> 3534.32s]  That was last thing was important. It was just a hundred words of nonsense and then one important line
[3535.61s -> 3540.80s]  Also open the customize screen before a battle if you press the r button in that menu
[3540.80s -> 3547.32s]  You can practice with your new part cool. You want to get out of practice mode press start and then retire
[3548.60s -> 3551.72s]  Oh like that guy germa985 in about four years
[3566.24s -> 3571.37s]  Well, if you don't understand press start while you're walking around let's get back to the office. All right, let's go
[3571.61s -> 3580.64s]  Hey dale before we go. Why don't you ask these lab guys for some info? They're robo researchers
[3580.64s -> 3582.64s]  They'll probably have plenty of stuff they can teach you
[3583.74s -> 3592.01s]  Give me a holler when you want to leave you're done already
[3593.42s -> 3597.66s]  I don't want to hurry back. We get back too quickly and earnest will just give us more work to do chill out
[3597.90s -> 3602.36s]  What I told you I was ready to leave. Okay, here we go
[3603.40s -> 3608.11s]  I need to clean this place. There are parts all over and I've got no clue where to start
[3608.86s -> 3613.02s]  Custom robots are composed of five parts a body a gun a bomb a pod and a leg unit
[3613.68s -> 3616.96s]  Commanders have the freedom to customize any of these five parts in any way they want
[3617.36s -> 3622.11s]  The custom part comes from planning a robo design based on battle situation. Thanks
[3625.44s -> 3627.44s]  Those criminals nearly got away with ray01
[3633.82s -> 3635.82s]  Robos ray
[3635.90s -> 3640.70s]  They're in the hollow museum. Wow, go look in the museum one day go look in the museum. Isn't that cool?
[3641.42s -> 3647.71s]  I talked to all the people
[3647.71s -> 3657.05s]  Wait, so you're the one who's taking ray01 from us and you already did an eye scan whoever makes eye contact with a robo
[3657.13s -> 3659.77s]  First is its registered commander the only one it obeys
[3660.57s -> 3662.73s]  That's what eye scan registration is all about
[3667.08s -> 3669.56s]  Thanks for helping us. We're good at science, but not at fighting
[3670.28s -> 3674.76s]  By the way, did you know that people who are trained to pilot robots are called commanders?
[3675.56s -> 3680.84s]  You're not even doing any work. What's what's your pro? What's what? Tell me
[3682.04s -> 3685.40s]  Most commanders become better at fighting by mastering each of the robo's abilities
[3685.88s -> 3689.72s]  By fighting robots customize their programming and develop ability to operate on new parts
[3690.36s -> 3693.72s]  That's why robots don't come pre-installed with all the parts
[3694.52s -> 3698.68s]  Custom robo needs battle experience in order to alter its code and learn new parts
[3699.40s -> 3703.56s]  Parts generators read your robo's battle log and install any new parts in your robot. Excuse me for a minute
[3706.96s -> 3708.96s]  Install any parts your robo is able to use
[3709.60s -> 3713.28s]  That's why you should check the nearest parts generator. Yes, check it all the time
[3716.78s -> 3722.06s]  Yeah, you want to know about the lab? There's a government funded robo research and development lab. You've already met linda, right?
[3722.06s -> 3724.14s]  She's the director of our lab. She's the director cool
[3725.42s -> 3729.13s]  I feel like if all these guys just ran as fast as they could into each other
[3730.09s -> 3735.05s]  Fucking full sprint smushed and smashed into each other. They could just be one guy and he could read me all that
[3735.61s -> 3743.50s]  I mean, hey, you're gonna have two maybe but you're done already. I am done
[3746.22s -> 3748.22s]  Oh, you got a three-way gun
[3751.10s -> 3752.62s]  Did I miss somebody?
[3752.62s -> 3768.12s]  It's a secret go on without me
[3769.08s -> 3782.59s]  That's it back. No, don't take us off course. Don't take us off course, man
[3787.37s -> 3789.37s]  I'm gonna um
[3789.37s -> 3792.01s]  I'm gonna abbreviate everything that's said from the next few minutes
[3794.22s -> 3796.40s]  guys talented chief
[3796.80s -> 3800.56s]  I don't know what happened out there, but linda called i'm supposed to hire him
[3801.36s -> 3803.36s]  Hey, you got a cool robo
[3805.39s -> 3808.64s]  All right, you're hired
[3808.64s -> 3810.64s]  We don't pay very well. Oh man
[3812.59s -> 3820.01s]  You got the job go home. I'm going home. Thanks tired. Yeah, see you later. Good
[3827.56s -> 3829.56s]  Do net the netflix dub
[3833.69s -> 3834.89s]  Wake up, sweetie
[3834.89s -> 3840.33s]  You don't want this to be a complete and total voice acting stream where you just read dialogue and everyone just goes
[3840.81s -> 3860.36s]  Yes. Oh wake up and go to work already. What the fuck are his pajamas?
[3861.88s -> 3863.95s]  What was wrong with them?
[3863.95s -> 3867.55s]  Time for you to wake up. Don't you start work today? Good luck with that
[3868.19s -> 3870.43s]  I'll do my best
[3870.43s -> 3875.79s]  Now i'm a little confused about all of this. What does a bounty hunter do? Is that like a mercenary?
[3876.35s -> 3880.54s]  It's hard to explain basically we hunt down criminals with their crimes and robos
[3881.10s -> 3883.10s]  But isn't that what the police squad does?
[3883.26s -> 3886.92s]  We take requests that the police squad considers too small to bother with
[3888.12s -> 3892.84s]  Sounds almost like those private eyes from the stories. Are you like a detective or something?
[3894.54s -> 3898.14s]  Well, I guess all that really matters is you're a commander just like your father
[3899.52s -> 3901.20s]  so hard work
[3901.20s -> 3904.35s]  Uh-huh. Bye
[3904.35s -> 3905.50s]  Oh
[3905.50s -> 3918.35s]  Look at me. It's all the same voice
[3919.15s -> 3920.11s]  Yeah
[3920.11s -> 3922.11s]  Catching on they're catching on. What do I do?
[3923.07s -> 3926.51s]  Go check in with earnest. He doesn't act like it, but he is the boss around here
[3931.79s -> 3936.59s]  Oh, you're here. We don't have the manpower to spend long training you we need to get you up to speed quickly
[3938.40s -> 3940.40s]  Say earnest, where's uh marcia?
[3940.80s -> 3944.80s]  I mean the new guy gets here right on time and she's nowhere to be seen. What's up with that?
[3946.68s -> 3949.80s]  Marcia is on duty right now. She's not a slacker like you harry
[3950.76s -> 3952.76s]  Huh on duty this early
[3952.92s -> 3955.23s]  I called you this morning, but you didn't answer
[3956.48s -> 3963.04s]  Really? That's odd. He ought to know I never answered my cell phone before I knew well, that's why I said marcia
[3965.13s -> 3967.13s]  Let me go help her i'll go
[3967.96s -> 3971.40s]  Thanks for the offer, but there's no need marcia. It'll be fine on her own
[3972.76s -> 3976.12s]  Marcia is a skilled commander not quite as skilled as me, of course
[3977.08s -> 3980.92s]  I heard you blew it pretty bad yesterday. Got yourself hurt in process
[3981.48s -> 3985.04s]  That was dale's fault. He snuck up behind me and
[3985.84s -> 3991.28s]  Anyway, uh like I was saying before you have to be ready for action at a moment's notice
[3992.41s -> 3994.73s]  Harry, I want you to take dale to the gym
[3995.45s -> 3999.05s]  Have him do some warm-ups
[3999.05s -> 4008.00s]  A little training, huh? Gotcha. Let's go down and keep your cell phone on. Yeah. Yeah, I hear you
[4008.32s -> 4014.01s]  You have to go to the gym together
[4014.01s -> 4021.95s]  That wasn't mr. Satan. This is mr. Satan and that's how you do mr. Satan. That was not even close
[4022.59s -> 4030.00s]  I got more than four voices. Come on. I got at least eight. This is the training gym
[4030.56s -> 4036.51s]  Ernest got us a group membership here so we can train whenever we want. Okay, let's do a round you versus me
[4040.12s -> 4045.50s]  two max
[4045.50s -> 4047.58s]  This table here is called a holozam deck
[4047.66s -> 4053.10s]  It's a machine that projects all holos and some commanders like me can create their own holos and some can't just the way it is
[4053.50s -> 4058.48s]  Commanders who can't just use a holozam that's built. I thought that's bullshit
[4058.96s -> 4061.76s]  Commanders who can't just use a holozam. Oh, that's bullshit
[4062.08s -> 4069.02s]  But they use holozam decks like these to make one for them. Okay, before we start i've got some pointers for you
[4069.82s -> 4073.58s]  Probably notice this but you can change the direction the pod fires in. Mm-hmm. Yes
[4074.81s -> 4080.17s]  If you don't tilt the control stick, it'll automatically fire in the direction of your opponent. Yes. Got it. Yes
[4101.08s -> 4102.81s]  Okay
[4102.81s -> 4104.89s]  I know you messed with the mouth
[4104.89s -> 4108.65s]  But the eyes those are like my real eyes and it really does look like my eyes are made out of clay
[4109.80s -> 4111.80s]  Like that's somebody's art project
[4121.60s -> 4128.75s]  jeff the killer
[4128.75s -> 4130.75s]  This is his robo
[4130.75s -> 4132.75s]  All right, let's put on my new parts
[4134.59s -> 4136.04s]  Ray one
[4136.04s -> 4137.88s]  That's all we got right now basic
[4137.88s -> 4139.00s]  freeway
[4139.00s -> 4141.24s]  ours three rounds and three rows
[4141.96s -> 4143.96s]  Aerial and ground shots are the same
[4144.56s -> 4148.56s]  It's easier to hit your target when shooting from the far so try to stay away. Yeah, let's try it
[4149.12s -> 4151.76s]  for this guy
[4151.76s -> 4152.88s]  standard
[4152.88s -> 4154.40s]  for this guy
[4154.40s -> 4155.52s]  standard
[4155.52s -> 4158.22s]  twin flank
[4158.22s -> 4161.66s]  Always one pod left and one pod right deploys two pods at one time
[4164.35s -> 4169.32s]  Right standard is all we got. All right, anything else?
[4169.88s -> 4174.16s]  Oh, let's just check this out
[4174.16s -> 4176.46s]  You can change the color too
[4176.46s -> 4184.75s]  Get into that
[4184.75s -> 4191.60s]  Mash buttons, right?
[4192.00s -> 4195.84s]  Okay, good jump on you. Ooh, this one's nice
[4203.00s -> 4205.61s]  Odd right
[4205.61s -> 4206.73s]  Ooh
[4206.73s -> 4223.23s]  This is the mouse thing the guy had
[4223.71s -> 4234.06s]  Get him get him get him get him get him doing missile spam
[4234.78s -> 4236.78s]  I'm not doing missile spam
[4236.86s -> 4246.84s]  But this is a fan art stream
[4247.24s -> 4252.70s]  This is not a fan art stream
[4253.42s -> 4263.85s]  Shoots more missiles, but i'm not sure I like it more
[4269.96s -> 4278.14s]  All right. No, i'm no more length. You now have access to the standard bomb s. Oh, okay, cool
[4279.02s -> 4282.70s]  All right, open the game up for me. I want to start customizing fighting and leveling up
[4285.69s -> 4287.85s]  I'm gonna rest for a bit. Why don't you just go up against the computer?
[4288.49s -> 4290.49s]  No, I don't want to go because the computer
[4293.39s -> 4295.47s]  Is he putting me into the room with the bots?
[4296.11s -> 4309.50s]  Wait, I want to go to a parts generator. It's the only entire house that doesn't have a parts generator in it
[4316.48s -> 4317.52s]  Was saying
[4317.52s -> 4319.76s]  Where do you think you're going? I want to there we go. All right
[4320.48s -> 4322.40s]  standard bomb s
[4322.40s -> 4323.52s]  Oh cool
[4323.52s -> 4327.80s]  Somebody said you're on an emulator
[4328.36s -> 4330.04s]  Shut stop it
[4330.04s -> 4334.12s]  Once a robot stops moving it takes time for it to reach full movement speed again. Okay, cool
[4337.48s -> 4342.36s]  No, I own the game. I own the disk. I own everything. I own the wemos. I own the game cube controller
[4343.00s -> 4345.32s]  It's right there
[4345.32s -> 4347.96s]  I own it. I this is I own this game. I own it
[4348.60s -> 4350.44s]  I own it. I own the whole thing
[4350.44s -> 4354.41s]  Don't stop moving
[4354.41s -> 4359.68s]  Do you understand? Yeah
[4359.68s -> 4365.76s]  I am playing custom robo right now. I own the game cube. I own the disk. I own the game cube controller
[4365.84s -> 4368.00s]  That's I just I own it. That's all i'm telling you. I own this
[4368.72s -> 4371.71s]  Whatever. I'm fine
[4371.79s -> 4377.96s]  Stop it
[4378.04s -> 4383.82s]  Others, okay. What was it called? There's a red. It was a bomb right
[4384.54s -> 4387.08s]  standard s
[4387.08s -> 4389.56s]  basic functions fly straight forward
[4391.12s -> 4396.32s]  Launches one bomb at a time it mobilizes target launch as often as possible. So your opponent cannot hide behind walls. Cool. That's right
[4397.04s -> 4402.91s]  Why don't you prove it show your ankles ban that guy for at least three days
[4412.60s -> 4414.04s]  All right, here we go
[4414.04s -> 4422.64s]  All right, should I spam now?
[4422.64s -> 4433.40s]  Good. Oh what the spawn protection?
[4440.30s -> 4449.71s]  Shit i'm gonna lose to the plot
[4450.27s -> 4468.64s]  Around around around around
[4468.64s -> 4475.34s]  I don't like this standard b
[4475.34s -> 4478.38s]  I'm not a big fan of standard b
[4478.38s -> 4483.12s]  It's too spread out
[4483.12s -> 4489.71s]  Destroy him i'm trying
[4489.71s -> 4504.56s]  It's the normal one, but it's better
[4504.72s -> 4516.65s]  I don't like it. I don't like it
[4516.65s -> 4528.36s]  No, please
[4529.66s -> 4540.68s]  Good no, fuck that rebirth shit. No
[4559.61s -> 4564.94s]  Games good speed pod. Wait, so can I just farm pods?
[4566.68s -> 4568.68s]  That was the wall. That was the tutorial wall
[4575.76s -> 4577.76s]  Speed pug let's see what it is
[4578.08s -> 4579.76s]  You got a speed pug
[4579.76s -> 4585.60s]  Okay, what does it do though?
[4585.60s -> 4590.41s]  Hey, where do you think you're going? I told you to practice. I just did I just kicked his ass
[4594.51s -> 4597.74s]  I'm done training you
[4597.74s -> 4602.83s]  Oh, you become vulnerable after you fire a gun use a slide shot to cover this
[4603.47s -> 4607.87s]  You press the b button while moving you can fire your gun while sliding in that direction
[4608.67s -> 4611.15s]  You use this skill properly. You can shoot while moving behind a wall
[4612.35s -> 4620.72s]  a slide shot
[4621.92s -> 4626.06s]  All right, i'm gonna change some things here
[4626.06s -> 4627.58s]  Let's take the uh
[4627.58s -> 4638.11s]  speed pod right
[4638.11s -> 4639.31s]  speed d
[4639.31s -> 4642.94s]  Quickly fly straight ahead can deploy two pods at one time
[4643.92s -> 4645.52s]  tons of speed
[4645.52s -> 4647.52s]  No homing, right?
[4648.00s -> 4651.45s]  Standard s or yeah, we'll keep standard s
[4652.17s -> 4656.70s]  All right, let's try what's with game cube games and
[4657.50s -> 4660.62s]  Revoice tutorials
[4660.62s -> 4663.07s]  You know
[4663.07s -> 4681.80s]  You know, I got three seconds on them already. All right, let's make this happen play right
[4683.60s -> 4696.59s]  speed pod
[4701.69s -> 4716.80s]  Fast cpu
[4716.80s -> 4718.80s]  Fast vtuber versus what?
[4722.38s -> 4736.57s]  Damn it. This game's kind of challenging like in a fun way
[4737.45s -> 4752.49s]  Get him down. Get him down. Get him down. Get him down
[4752.65s -> 4754.59s]  Fuck you
[4754.59s -> 4766.41s]  Hey nintendo, what the fuck are you gonna remember the series? That's kids. What are you saying?
[4776.91s -> 4778.91s]  Somebody did a spam and I couldn't read it
[4779.55s -> 4793.05s]  I'm doing the slide shot. We're not doing it. Well
[4793.85s -> 4799.26s]  All right, right here
[4799.26s -> 4808.48s]  Hey nintendo, I can't read it
[4808.64s -> 4814.68s]  Hey nintendo, when the fuck are you going to remember the series or remember f0 for more than aesthetic callbacks?
[4815.00s -> 4819.56s]  When are you going to remember kid icarus nintendo? Stop fucking around bring back the underdog games
[4820.28s -> 4822.97s]  You now have access to the criminal
[4823.13s -> 4824.33s]  Okay, cool
[4824.33s -> 4833.48s]  What's the criminal?
[4833.48s -> 4835.48s]  You got a criminal. Wait, what?
[4835.87s -> 4837.47s]  Is that a new robot?
[4837.47s -> 4843.58s]  Allow me to explain the trick flyer model
[4844.22s -> 4849.42s]  My robo utilizes this body type the trick flyer has excellent aerial ability. However, it moves slowly on the ground
[4851.04s -> 4854.56s]  Doesn't jump far, but it can do a quick air dash up to three times
[4855.36s -> 4859.36s]  When using a trick flyer, you should approach your opponent with an air dash and then attack
[4860.24s -> 4861.44s]  Get it
[4861.44s -> 4870.48s]  Oh, this looks cool
[4870.48s -> 4876.19s]  All right customize ray one. I got criminal
[4881.02s -> 4883.02s]  agile while airborne
[4883.08s -> 4885.08s]  Extremely slow on the ground

[5538.17s -> 5547.85s]  And while I was waiting they saw each other and they started fighting over me. Well, what did you expect?
[5548.57s -> 5553.21s]  So anyway, i'm like freaking out here. I called the police but they said they didn't have enough men

[5939.96s -> 5943.32s]  Well, that's your own business. It's not my fault if you guys get taken by the cops
[5943.88s -> 5949.68s]  I could have sworn that the law places full responsibility on an employer of a robo commander
[5951.61s -> 5953.61s]  What are you serious?

[6841.95s -> 6843.55s]  See you later trish
[6843.55s -> 6854.67s]  What you should be caring about is not about how high your gpa is
[6855.07s -> 6858.91s]  But what you are retaining from the shit that you want to learn
[6860.61s -> 6864.79s]  That's the that's way more important than having like a 4.0 gpa
[6866.11s -> 6870.51s]  How much are you taking how much are you retaining? How many skills are you developing develop some skills develop some brain power?
[6870.91s -> 6875.47s]  Oh, I didn't get I got a d on this who fucking cares. You got a d on that test who gives a shit
[6875.95s -> 6878.90s]  What did you learn?
[6878.90s -> 6882.90s]  When when my son or daughter goes to college and they come back and they're like dad
[6884.34s -> 6888.34s]  I got like a 2.1 2.2. Let me see that i'll let me see
[6889.46s -> 6891.46s]  Okay. All right. What did you learn though?
[6891.87s -> 6893.31s]  Show me what you've learned
[6893.31s -> 6898.86s]  And then they'll pull out like a piano and like start playing a fucking beautiful song and i'll be like there you go
[6898.86s -> 6901.18s]  That's what you've learned. Whatever you're doing. I don't care. Whatever it is. Good work
[6904.32s -> 6908.56s]  What are you retaining not what are you remembering? That's way more important
[6909.44s -> 6911.06s]  think about that
[6911.06s -> 6916.28s]  Tests a test. What are you retaining versus? What are you remembering?
[6919.08s -> 6921.08s]  Short term to get a passing grade
[6923.01s -> 6944.23s]  Keep that in mind. It's very very important. It's too bad employers. Don't think like that. Some of them do some of them do
[6948.85s -> 6950.63s]  omega q
[6950.63s -> 6957.51s]  Okay. All right. Do you want to talk about like productivity and like what makes a good employment environment?
[6959.30s -> 6961.22s]  Which this should be a four-day work week
[6961.22s -> 6965.22s]  You know how much more shit people get done not spending five six days a week
[6965.86s -> 6967.86s]  You get way more shit done
[6967.94s -> 6980.24s]  But you get a 15 minute break every eight hours here at the job
[6981.52s -> 6986.64s]  Oh, you you bet you're stressing out. You've got too much stuff to do. You're not being able to take breaks
[6986.96s -> 6989.04s]  Your your mind can't function that way
[6991.12s -> 6995.52s]  We need a four goddamn work week. I'm not talking less work, by the way. I'm not talking everybody should do
[6996.00s -> 6997.84s]  Don't do less
[6997.84s -> 7002.56s]  You get way more done when you have less time. It's weird, but it's true
[7003.78s -> 7008.58s]  When you're working for less time, you have more time to spread out your brain and be able to actually
[7009.22s -> 7024.15s]  Develop your brain off work. It's trust me. It's scientific. Look it up not 14 hours a day
[7024.31s -> 7035.09s]  No, same time less days unionize your workplace. Thanks for this five subs
[7035.65s -> 7040.40s]  We're not talking about any we're not talking. I'm just talking about productivity. All right
[7045.96s -> 7049.40s]  And why do you have the mods work a hundred plus hours a week? Shut up
[7053.09s -> 7055.09s]  Hey, um, i'm kidding
[7055.83s -> 7056.96s]  um
[7056.96s -> 7062.74s]  You should no dude you got that's i'll we'll talk about that later. Good job
[7065.19s -> 7067.59s]  I've got some business to take care of. I want to leave right now
[7075.51s -> 7078.71s]  If you two are going to be partners, you ought to spend some quality time together
[7079.19s -> 7084.18s]  Chat on the way home and get to know each other partners. Why can't marcia be his partner?
[7085.06s -> 7087.62s]  The marcia can't handle herself
[7088.42s -> 7091.46s]  And you're the one who told me to hire dale in the first place
[7094.31s -> 7096.39s]  Why does everything bad always happen to me?
[7097.35s -> 7102.34s]  I think he's drinking his own tears
[7104.90s -> 7113.84s]  He is ugly crying
[7113.84s -> 7115.86s]  Okay, uh
[7115.86s -> 7120.10s]  I gotta be honest. I was not hey, I was not retaining any of that information
[7120.18s -> 7124.66s]  I was just saying it or remembering it short term. What happened there? I don't know. Where am I going?
[7125.06s -> 7132.37s]  I didn't retain any of that
[7132.37s -> 7139.03s]  Not even short term
[7139.03s -> 7142.18s]  I didn't fail the test
[7142.18s -> 7147.59s]  You would take you were talking during it. It's talking during the test. Where would we need to go training gym?
[7147.91s -> 7153.62s]  It's a square root of what's a square root of what's the square root of 16?
[7155.12s -> 7156.16s]  um
[7156.16s -> 7157.46s]  I don't know
[7157.46s -> 7159.88s]  I don't care
[7159.88s -> 7162.69s]  Wait, where were we actually going?
[7162.69s -> 7165.41s]  I was not paying a single attention at all. Is it the training grounds?
[7165.97s -> 7170.48s]  It's about go to marcia, right?
[7172.12s -> 7173.40s]  Go home

[7195.48s -> 7204.12s]  Okay, gotta get back home and call trish
[7204.76s -> 7212.95s]  Is that trish's number?
[7213.11s -> 7218.13s]  Is that the comic relief there that that's the number that he dropped? I guess yeah
[7225.81s -> 7227.33s]  Dale get up
[7227.33s -> 7229.09s]  Hurry up and go to work
[7229.09s -> 7242.60s]  The person only has two outfits

[7312.23s -> 7315.57s]  They got a call from the landlady. She said it's out of her control
[7316.29s -> 7318.29s]  She requested you specifically

[7417.68s -> 7424.20s]  I don't know a thing about robos. You know that I didn't have a clue how to stop them and that's why I
[7425.32s -> 7427.32s]  I called stolen horse
[7427.40s -> 7429.96s]  I also wanted to see what you like when you had work
[7431.99s -> 7433.99s]  Thanks
[7433.99s -> 7446.00s]  Dale, let's cut the chat and go stop them. Yeah, you're right. Good luck turning into roger
[7448.82s -> 7452.02s]  Man, this is bad. Let's wrap this up quickly
[7453.43s -> 7455.70s]  I'll stop the husband
[7455.70s -> 7460.74s]  You go handle his wife. They're all it's turning. Yeah, it's either roger or neelix. It turns back and forth somehow
[7463.56s -> 7466.84s]  I've turned the safety switch on so that nobody gets hurt
[7468.55s -> 7470.55s]  What's a safety switch?
[7470.79s -> 7475.86s]  It's a switch that describes decreases your robo's power to prevent you from hurting your opponent
[7476.58s -> 7482.29s]  The switch is on the robo cube. If you turn the safety switch on and dive the safety mechanics will automatically kick in
[7482.85s -> 7484.77s]  It won't look any different
[7484.77s -> 7485.89s]  Okay
[7485.89s -> 7491.78s]  Can we get should we do an investigation?
[7493.99s -> 7497.32s]  Man, let's get along
[7497.32s -> 7502.50s]  Yeah, stop fighting
[7507.91s -> 7516.04s]  Holy shit
[7516.04s -> 7518.04s]  What you're taking his side
[7518.84s -> 7521.46s]  Don't mess with me
[7521.46s -> 7525.46s]  Be your opponent my metal ape. It's a metal grappler
[7526.34s -> 7528.34s]  little grappler
[7529.72s -> 7534.04s]  Got a little excited there. The metal grappler has extremely high defense
[7534.92s -> 7539.40s]  It's hard for it to get knocked down. But since it moves slow, I have a hard time dodging it down
[7539.88s -> 7541.88s]  I can only do one air dash
[7542.36s -> 7543.64s]  Oh
[7543.64s -> 7548.60s]  I'm gonna lean in real close. I usually focus on attacking rather than worrying about a little damage
[7549.48s -> 7555.78s]  Got it
[7555.78s -> 7557.12s]  Got it
[7557.12s -> 7561.35s]  Huh?
[7561.35s -> 7563.35s]  Why am I explaining all of this to you?
[7567.91s -> 7570.60s]  Yeah, why are you telling me this?
[7570.60s -> 7576.50s]  Got a cool sword
[7576.50s -> 7581.92s]  All right. So just hide I like this. I currently like this
[7584.10s -> 7585.22s]  Battle
[7585.22s -> 7587.97s]  Yeah, I wasn't a big fan of that line by the way
[7588.13s -> 7593.41s]  Hey, you require my assistance. Let's see. I could do a better job than that. You require my assistance
[7594.21s -> 7596.12s]  your battle
[7596.12s -> 7598.12s]  That's better. That's what he sounded like in warcraft 3
[7598.36s -> 7610.56s]  I would have done just replace it
[7611.12s -> 7613.12s]  What an ego maniac
[7615.11s -> 7617.67s]  Don't say that don't say that or you're gonna get fucking banned
[7619.78s -> 7621.78s]  All right. This the dash is way better
[7622.10s -> 7633.35s]  Send out the mice. We just have to dodge. This is an ape type, right?
[7634.07s -> 7641.24s]  Knock them down
[7641.24s -> 7642.60s]  Good volley
[7642.60s -> 7646.53s]  Thermal punching. Fuck you
[7646.61s -> 7648.61s]  You don't don't use me against me. Okay
[7649.17s -> 7651.80s]  Don't forget. That's me punching
[7651.88s -> 7656.18s]  I'm gonna punch myself
[7656.18s -> 7657.62s]  Careful with that emo
[7657.62s -> 7659.59s]  There's lava in this thing
[7659.59s -> 7677.06s]  Stop hitting yourself. Stop hitting yourself
[7677.62s -> 7705.33s]  That was clean. Thermal slaps himself. Why are you doing that? Nobody has raided
[7707.88s -> 7709.24s]  We don't have a raid
[7709.24s -> 7711.80s]  Why are you embarrassing me in front of a raid that doesn't exist?
[7713.06s -> 7721.89s]  vertical gun
[7721.89s -> 7724.37s]  Ow, ow, right that burns me up
[7727.06s -> 7729.22s]  That was a waste of time. Let's head back to the office
[7731.91s -> 7733.19s]  Oh, oh, oh
[7733.19s -> 7735.19s]  Are you hurt dear who hurt you?
[7735.75s -> 7738.48s]  That crudely dressed punk over there
[7739.44s -> 7742.56s]  What are you talking about? You're hurt because you've gotten a stupid fight with your wife
[7743.28s -> 7745.28s]  I only calmed you down
[7745.73s -> 7748.45s]  How dare you hurt my hubby?
[7749.17s -> 7753.97s]  Get up, dear. We'll defeat these evil villains and show them that our love is strong
[7754.69s -> 7756.93s]  That's right. I love you
[7758.15s -> 7767.94s]  I love you, too
[7767.94s -> 7770.26s]  What does this happen to happen to me? I'm just some guy
[7771.65s -> 7773.65s]  Hey, Dale, come here. We're gonna beat him up
[7774.29s -> 7780.47s]  You never had a two-on-two battle before have you it's when two people team up on two others
[7781.27s -> 7782.95s]  What are you doing?
[7782.95s -> 7785.27s]  Sorry, just wait one minute. I have to explain to the new guy
[7785.99s -> 7788.55s]  Hey, Dale, listen carefully. I'll explain two-on-two battles
[7789.35s -> 7792.42s]  At least they're aware, right?
[7792.82s -> 7795.70s]  Basic controls are the same as the one-on-one battles, but there's one difference
[7796.42s -> 7799.86s]  The arrow on top of your robo's head locks onto one of your opponents
[7800.66s -> 7802.66s]  You want to change your target? You have to press Y
[7803.54s -> 7805.54s]  Okay, good thing I didn't skip that
[7812.74s -> 7814.90s]  You're red and i'm blue and our opponents are green and yellow
[7815.64s -> 7819.24s]  Every time you press Y the colored arrow above the changes and it goes that way. Okay
[7820.04s -> 7823.24s]  I told you i'm blue. What good does it do to shoot your own partner?
[7824.40s -> 7826.40s]  You can't fire your gun while you're changing targets
[7827.48s -> 7828.76s]  Are you done yet?
[7828.76s -> 7830.76s]  Sorry, there's just a little bit more one more second
[7831.08s -> 7833.94s]  Your opponents have colored arrows over their heads, too
[7834.74s -> 7837.46s]  Those arrows turn red. That means that they're locked on to you
[7838.26s -> 7841.75s]  Got it got it got it. Now listen
[7842.39s -> 7844.95s]  Look carefully at the colored arrows and see who's locked on to who?
[7845.51s -> 7850.37s]  Keep that in mind while you fight
[7850.37s -> 7852.69s]  All right nightbot just said i've been live for two hours and 11 minutes
[7852.69s -> 7856.37s]  I thought someone was chatting saying germa. It's been two hours and 11 minutes resident sleeper
[7863.01s -> 7873.57s]  Actually, this is I like this. I'm gonna stay with what I got. I like it. Oh by the way tomorrow
[7874.45s -> 7877.73s]  Tomorrow is part two of dlc movie night
[7878.53s -> 7882.18s]  And watch the rest of the playlist
[7882.26s -> 7885.64s]  I'm already up
[7885.64s -> 7888.77s]  Wait, is that my friend?
[7888.77s -> 7894.87s]  No, that's not this is a little confusing. All right, i'm gonna i'm with this guy this guy down here
[7895.59s -> 7907.89s]  How are you doing over there?
[7907.89s -> 7913.97s]  No, no, keep attacking him attack him
[7914.45s -> 7915.65s]  Yes
[7915.65s -> 7926.76s]  Take out the big guy first focus the big guy
[7927.40s -> 7929.33s]  What are you dumb?
[7929.33s -> 7939.01s]  All right, that's it
[7939.01s -> 7941.57s]  Don't even let him get up
[7941.57s -> 7947.78s]  I'll just rain missiles. You just do all the work
[7948.26s -> 7963.36s]  Good job. When does this guy take off his pants?
[7967.00s -> 7969.48s]  You're talking about me. Um, that doesn't happen on stream
[7970.63s -> 7973.25s]  Oh, I got access to the metal ape
[7973.41s -> 7976.04s]  spider pod
[7977.76s -> 7980.64s]  Do oh, do you two have to be so cute? Give me a break
[7981.28s -> 7984.64s]  We've got our safety switches on and they're going at it for real. This ain't a joke
[7988.29s -> 7990.56s]  Are you two okay?
[7990.56s -> 7992.48s]  What are you doing here marcia?
[7992.48s -> 7994.92s]  The chief was worried about you. He said
[7995.62s -> 7998.90s]  Where's this going? I'm not sure where this is going. It's going somewhere
[8000.02s -> 8002.10s]  I don't know where it was. I guess we're just gonna do this
[8002.66s -> 8009.54s]  The chief was worried about you. He said you weren't your normal self today. Hey great. Well, you've got perfect timing. It's all over
[8010.50s -> 8011.94s]  I see
[8011.94s -> 8014.34s]  But how do things turn so ugly so quickly?
[8014.98s -> 8020.29s]  That's what I like to know man. What a mess
[8022.47s -> 8026.15s]  He was washing my husband's clothes this morning and I found a note in his coat pocket
[8026.71s -> 8031.67s]  There was a phone number on it. I didn't know what it was. I called it and a young lady answered
[8032.31s -> 8034.47s]  I was certain that my husband was cheating on me
[8035.27s -> 8039.11s]  But honey, I told you I just found that note out front this morning
[8039.83s -> 8045.67s]  I believe you you never do anything like that. I'm sorry. I lost my temper. I'm sure it was only a prank
[8046.63s -> 8051.56s]  Really? Who would have planted that thing out where you'd find it like that?
[8052.28s -> 8057.41s]  Prank or no prank. I I hope you're sorry. We're bruised up because of your stupid fight
[8059.86s -> 8064.34s]  Harry, please stop. There are children here and you're scaring them
[8069.51s -> 8073.03s]  I'll get them. I'm the murloc. What's from the
[8073.91s -> 8075.51s]  The game heart has done
[8075.51s -> 8079.51s]  What's his name? Sir Finley, right? Sir Finley
[8079.51s -> 8084.15s]  I've played look every stream is the every stream is the last thing that I did
[8084.71s -> 8086.07s]  Okay
[8086.07s -> 8093.41s]  The last thing that I did you guys are gonna hear about it all day every time. What do you want me to do?
[8093.97s -> 8096.28s]  It's just up there and I can't get it out
[8096.44s -> 8100.68s]  And I don't like it. I think the game's stupid now, but like I played it and that's all that's up there. I can't help it
[8101.32s -> 8109.64s]  This is how memories work
[8114.10s -> 8116.10s]  Fucking boomer loser
[8116.82s -> 8118.04s]  All right
[8118.36s -> 8125.19s]  You get some leeway but all right, that's time up for 10 minutes i'm out for 10 minutes
[8129.52s -> 8131.52s]  Who's ready for some adventure?
[8156.76s -> 8158.20s]  see
[8158.20s -> 8160.20s]  CBD CBD
[8160.36s -> 8350.36s]  I'm going to get a water relax a glass of water and I got some coffee just a little bit more
[8358.45s -> 8361.89s]  Weed infused coffee that would be I'm not a fan of that kind of stuff
[8362.69s -> 8365.41s]  I don't like just i'm just gonna just give it to me just someone want to eat it
[8367.11s -> 8371.27s]  I don't want like weed infused fucking like salmon fillets. No, I don't want that
[8371.99s -> 8376.93s]  I don't want like a weed infused coke product. No, just I just just give it to me. I'll eat it
[8378.84s -> 8382.28s]  If you're into that stuff, cool. They're cool. That's i'm glad you are
[8383.08s -> 8389.60s]  I just want to eat it
[8389.60s -> 8391.92s]  Weed and cocaine mixed together
[8392.64s -> 8394.64s]  No, don't do that. That's a terrible idea
[8395.44s -> 8399.40s]  Don't do that. We found this in front of our front doorstep
[8407.57s -> 8410.93s]  Don't we stop blinking me though like mustache hair guy. I saw it
[8412.16s -> 8414.72s]  It was written by a girl. She has cute handwriting
[8420.90s -> 8422.90s]  Cute, let me see
[8425.12s -> 8426.87s]  Whoa
[8426.87s -> 8435.32s]  I'll take this as evidence. Give me that
[8435.32s -> 8439.08s]  Modded 3d movie maker characters got it figured it out. It's taking me a while. That's what this is
[8440.37s -> 8443.73s]  It's nothing. I can't let a helpless girl carry around a heavy load, you know
[8444.29s -> 8452.13s]  It's just a piece of paper. It's great. Everything worked out. Don't they look good together and they lived happily ever after
[8452.77s -> 8457.80s]  Harry are you all right?
[8457.80s -> 8459.48s]  Uh, what do you mean?
[8459.48s -> 8464.84s]  Just a second ago you were furious, but now furious. Oh me. I've made a love. Hey deal. You need to lighten up
[8465.80s -> 8468.68s]  Married couples have their reasons for things. You gotta give them some slack
[8471.70s -> 8472.66s]  Got it
[8472.66s -> 8476.55s]  Okay kids
[8476.55s -> 8479.59s]  Are you scared your parents are fine now? Everything's all right
[8480.92s -> 8484.36s]  Listen to me when i'm talking what i'm talking we're talking to the children now harry
[8485.00s -> 8486.39s]  Stop
[8486.39s -> 8489.08s]  Come on. Let's go play over there
[8490.40s -> 8492.00s]  Marcia
[8492.00s -> 8496.02s]  So you both want to be commanders when you grow up? How about a custom robo game?
[8496.90s -> 8504.07s]  Sheesh, what's wrong surprised to see marcia being nice to the kids
[8507.04s -> 8513.38s]  Um, I don't I don't care. I don't care at all. Like that's cool. Nice. Why would you not be nice to kids?
[8514.02s -> 8515.38s]  I don't care
[8515.38s -> 8518.84s]  Come on. Hear me out. She's actually a nice person. I okay
[8520.21s -> 8521.73s]  You see
[8521.73s -> 8525.09s]  Time to lure dump on you marcia's parents passed away a few years ago
[8525.25s -> 8529.25s]  It was just her and her big brother her big brother was an elite member of the police squad marcia got along
[8529.25s -> 8531.49s]  Well with her brother real well her brother took good care of her
[8531.65s -> 8536.05s]  But one day marcia's brother up and quit the police squad without a word and then he just disappeared. No one's seen him since
[8536.85s -> 8538.92s]  okay
[8538.92s -> 8540.28s]  um then
[8540.28s -> 8543.80s]  Okay, not only did marcia lose her parents, but she also lost an older brother. That's
[8544.68s -> 8547.30s]  I don't know this like this is the appropriate place to do this
[8548.10s -> 8550.02s]  Like in this house here
[8550.02s -> 8553.94s]  And now she's alone. Yeah, that sort of sums it up
[8554.50s -> 8560.39s]  I've said this is like a situation where you we leave and you pull me aside
[8561.03s -> 8563.03s]  And say hey, just want to let you know a couple things
[8563.59s -> 8567.11s]  He's doing he's like just monologuing in this person's living room
[8567.67s -> 8573.88s]  I feel the same way for a long time marcia has been gifted with a strange power. Uh, oh
[8575.24s -> 8576.92s]  Uh-oh
[8576.92s -> 8583.88s]  That girl's got a strange power. She's like a god. She has god powers and and she I got it. I got it
[8584.52s -> 8590.34s]  Because of that she's always been the quiet type. She used to be a lot happier
[8591.06s -> 8595.94s]  And now she's lost her parents and her big brother shut up from the world and unable to reach out to anyone
[8595.94s -> 8597.70s]  She's gotten a lot better though
[8597.70s -> 8602.71s]  The reason marcia wants a class a license is because she wants to join the police squad
[8603.43s -> 8607.19s]  Can't join the police squad unless you get a class a license. How was I supposed to know that I failed that on the test
[8607.83s -> 8613.52s]  She probably wants to track down some clues on her brother herself
[8623.56s -> 8630.64s]  Hey, laugh, how do I uncook luigi? I accidentally dropped him in the deep fryer
[8632.21s -> 8637.97s]  Uh, well, you're gonna be in big trouble because that's half of uh nintendo's like entire
[8639.16s -> 8640.36s]  fan base
[8640.36s -> 8642.60s]  and library
[8642.60s -> 8644.60s]  You're gonna have to come up with a solution for that
[8644.68s -> 8655.78s]  What am I saying that somebody said somebody said that
[8659.44s -> 8660.96s]  I didn't say that
[8660.96s -> 8662.96s]  Will you guys think that i'm saying this?
[8664.26s -> 8666.26s]  Oh shit, I did say it like I just said it
[8666.90s -> 8670.26s]  Yes, they did say that I will find it right now before I get still lost in the chat
[8673.17s -> 8679.11s]  I'm just like insane and i'm sitting here going okay. How do I uncook luigi guys? I dropped him in the fryer
[8681.48s -> 8685.00s]  I I gotta find it somebody fucking really said that and it was fucked
[8685.72s -> 8698.71s]  Like yeah, it's gone. Okay, let's head back to the office awesome. I got trish's number back
[8699.51s -> 8707.41s]  Yeah, so germa owns the game and he'd rather emulate it. Am I wrong?
[8708.74s -> 8712.93s]  Um mike listen sometimes some games have problems being captured
[8714.12s -> 8718.05s]  They become uncapturable happens with a lot of them actually
[8718.69s -> 8721.41s]  Try to pull it through a capture device and the audio might be all messed up
[8721.41s -> 8723.73s]  It could be a huge problem. The disc could be scratched
[8724.21s -> 8728.24s]  Doesn't mean you don't own it. I know not all of them. Excuse me
[8728.80s -> 8732.00s]  Excuse me, not all of them only like three ever
[8732.64s -> 8738.15s]  Hold on. It's on the phone
[8738.15s -> 8741.17s]  Hello chief. Yes, harry and dale took care of it
[8741.81s -> 8745.65s]  Hurry up and hover a bogey's cafe marv's there more characters
[8747.65s -> 8750.85s]  Show disc I I don't have to do that because I know it had
[8751.57s -> 8755.25s]  God, I know this is a gaslight bullshit. I'm not doing it
[8755.97s -> 8759.32s]  If we catch that marv, we should get a big reward

[8963.35s -> 8965.35s]  Not plugged in not plugged in
[8965.59s -> 8969.27s]  Not plugged in I have the disc. I have to prove that to people apparently

[8972.63s -> 8974.63s]  To play the game. I'm sorry
[8976.31s -> 8979.48s]  yell at them
[8979.48s -> 8984.12s]  Flexing on your viewers but proving that I own the game the console and the controller
[8990.42s -> 8992.74s]  Okay, here we go. The chief wants us to go to bogies
[8993.54s -> 8995.22s]  That guy is the reward
[8995.22s -> 8997.22s]  All right. I'm gonna do us all a favor
[8997.22s -> 8999.22s]  Uh
[9003.46s -> 9005.46s]  I like my cup
[9013.09s -> 9015.09s]  No skipping miku. No
[9018.80s -> 9020.80s]  How do I unpoop my pants?
[9021.28s -> 9022.88s]  Waddle over to the toilet
[9022.88s -> 9027.52s]  Take your underwear off and just take the underwear and turn it upside down and dump it into the toilet and then just
[9028.00s -> 9030.00s]  Throw the underwear in the trash done
[9032.34s -> 9038.23s]  His name is evil
[9038.23s -> 9045.51s]  Harry and marcia. No, I get a bit of harry and marcy. What's going on? Oh great. Not him
[9047.03s -> 9050.47s]  Harry harry harry still have the manners of a kindergarten. Eh
[9051.94s -> 9055.70s]  I assume you're here for the notorious outlaw marv
[9057.06s -> 9061.54s]  I'm sorry, but you're too late dark blue. Oh more specifically. I
[9062.18s -> 9064.90s]  Evil have already captured the rogue
[9066.40s -> 9067.44s]  Darn it
[9067.44s -> 9069.44s]  Dark blue got the reward
[9069.44s -> 9076.29s]  How did you know that marv was here?
[9076.84s -> 9083.56s]  So you want to learn my secrets you hope to benefit from my wisdom perhaps. Okay, i'll tell you
[9084.44s -> 9088.92s]  One of something weird about voices and acting and just hearing people talk very loudly
[9089.32s -> 9091.56s]  I'm gonna ruin every single thing for you ever
[9093.04s -> 9095.04s]  You are now going to hear
[9095.62s -> 9097.62s]  all the huge intakes
[9098.18s -> 9099.30s]  of air
[9099.30s -> 9103.35s]  When people do voice acting now, it's all you're gonna hear
[9105.08s -> 9107.72s]  Even when you watch the news, you're not gonna hear the breath
[9110.02s -> 9113.70s]  When newscasters talk especially anchors or reporters
[9114.34s -> 9116.24s]  Just listen
[9116.24s -> 9118.40s]  So we are here live on the scene and i'm here
[9119.20s -> 9121.11s]  You'll hear it
[9121.11s -> 9123.91s]  It turns out the car drove past all these
[9124.47s -> 9127.03s]  Yeah, that's just how it happens now
[9127.27s -> 9130.69s]  That's all you'll hear
[9130.69s -> 9132.61s]  Don't listen don't listen
[9132.61s -> 9144.26s]  That's not how normal people breathe. Just listen next time i'm gonna drive somebody insane
[9145.06s -> 9150.82s]  Because he's gonna people are gonna be like no, no, he's right. It's the only thing I could hear
[9155.92s -> 9161.28s]  Bogey here officially requested the services of my little mercenary crew dark now i'm freaking out because you're gonna hear it
[9162.80s -> 9164.80s]  What bogey why?
[9164.88s -> 9167.76s]  But you told us you always go to steel hearts when you've got trouble
[9173.46s -> 9176.74s]  Well, your boss has been here all day sucking down coffee and
[9177.62s -> 9182.28s]  And what and he was sitting in a dark corner all by himself?
[9182.92s -> 9184.92s]  Writing poetry and occasionally weeping
[9185.86s -> 9192.77s]  How can I rely on you guys when your boss is such a space cadet poetry i'd be worried too
[9196.02s -> 9202.66s]  Young earnest is a poet and you didn't know it. Oh, this is too shit. It's all I hear
[9210.74s -> 9213.89s]  I did it myself
[9213.89s -> 9218.21s]  Hmm. Well now aren't you the kid who came in looking for a job with dark blue not too long ago?
[9218.69s -> 9221.33s]  Of course, that's right. Your name's dale
[9222.69s -> 9224.69s]  You apply to dark blue too
[9225.64s -> 9226.84s]  Yeah
[9226.84s -> 9228.68s]  I applied to lots of places
[9228.68s -> 9233.65s]  I applied a lot. This is not me making a joke. This is real life now
[9234.21s -> 9238.05s]  Don't act coy evil knows your name. You must have applied at dark blue
[9238.93s -> 9243.17s]  So you couldn't get into dark blue and we're next on your list fine with me
[9244.69s -> 9249.89s]  Oh, what is with you ceaseless blathering harry. Are you saying you know dale too?
[9250.93s -> 9252.05s]  Wait
[9252.05s -> 9253.65s]  Don't tell me
[9253.65s -> 9255.89s]  Did steel hearts hire this amateur?
[9256.61s -> 9258.61s]  That is rich
[9265.64s -> 9268.68s]  Shut your face
[9268.68s -> 9271.88s]  Dale has tons of talent and someday he'll be an excellent commander
[9273.81s -> 9275.81s]  At least that's what linda says
[9275.89s -> 9281.09s]  I have to stop paying him. All right, i'm gonna I need 30 30 seconds to recalibrate and just forget about the thing that I just
[9281.09s -> 9282.63s]  Told you guys
[9282.63s -> 9284.63s]  It's it's it's fucking up my brain
[9292.42s -> 9297.35s]  I've got an idea somebody somebody somebody sounds like a skipping cd
[9298.23s -> 9314.16s]  Oh, he sounds like a skipping like what did you say breathe and blink manually stop it
[9315.28s -> 9318.80s]  Why did I do this to myself? I casted a spell back at myself accidentally
[9321.49s -> 9324.61s]  And all of you in chat are going to have one arm now
[9325.17s -> 9327.17s]  And it bounced back in a mirror. Oh shit
[9328.55s -> 9330.55s]  I have now I have one arm now
[9336.85s -> 9341.25s]  reversed
[9341.25s -> 9343.65s]  Yeah, i've got a few verses for you right here
[9344.37s -> 9348.21s]  Oh very witty harry. Have you ever considered a change of career? Perhaps as a clown?
[9349.89s -> 9351.89s]  Enough chit chat. We're leaving now
[9353.57s -> 9356.69s]  Dale if you do turn out to be a worthy commander we'll make you an offer
[9357.49s -> 9366.66s]  Don't make a hearthstone reference. Don't do it. I'm gonna do it. Don't make the hearthstone say it. Dr. Boom fuck
[9367.30s -> 9373.49s]  Harry let's go back to the office. We need to report this to the chief
[9374.21s -> 9376.07s]  Yeah, you're right
[9376.07s -> 9381.38s]  The last thing I did is the only thing i've done
[9383.75s -> 9388.45s]  You minus two suck minus two. You can't do two. Come on. Come on
[9390.66s -> 9394.34s]  All right, we get to report back to our stupid chief. We didn't even I didn't get to play the game
[9396.56s -> 9398.66s]  That was just a ton of exposition
[9407.27s -> 9410.92s]  steel hearts
[9412.20s -> 9413.24s]  What
[9413.24s -> 9415.16s]  So let me get this straight
[9415.16s -> 9417.56s]  Not only do you
[9417.56s -> 9420.52s]  Not catch marv, but you let dark blue nab the ransom
[9421.08s -> 9425.56s]  You know, that's why everyone keeps making fun of us if we'd caught marv. We'd have gotten a huge reward
[9426.92s -> 9430.20s]  So one of the world took you some her knee good palms lately
[9432.61s -> 9435.32s]  Hey, what?
[9435.32s -> 9437.32s]  bogey called in dark blue
[9437.78s -> 9441.46s]  Bogey said he didn't want to hire someone who'd rather write poems than catch felons
[9445.54s -> 9449.51s]  What?
[9451.70s -> 9452.82s]  Well
[9452.82s -> 9456.42s]  These things happen good work everyone. Let's call it quits for today dismissed
[9457.06s -> 9465.22s]  We go to business now
[9465.22s -> 9466.74s]  He got away again
[9466.74s -> 9469.27s]  Let's go home. Gotta call trish gotta call trish
[9469.91s -> 9473.67s]  Dale, what are you doing after this?
[9476.55s -> 9479.46s]  See you tomorrow
[9479.46s -> 9491.73s]  the future gamer chair
[9491.73s -> 9494.42s]  Ring
[9496.18s -> 9504.31s]  Who could be calling me this early in the morning? Hey, yeah, which me harry you awake
[9505.35s -> 9507.91s]  Uh harry. Yeah morning. I'm up. What's going on?
[9509.19s -> 9517.62s]  Showtime partner seems like there's a robo fight at the diamond chinese restaurant earnest wants us there as soon as possible
[9518.72s -> 9520.72s]  There you mean at the office?
[9520.80s -> 9522.80s]  No, he wants us to go straight to diamond
[9523.76s -> 9528.04s]  That thing at bogey's yesterday has been bugging him. So he said he'd meet up with us there
[9529.57s -> 9531.57s]  Okay, got it diamond, right?
[9531.73s -> 9543.36s]  Coolio see you there. All right, so every resident sleeper. I see you one cent goes into the resident sleeper bank
[9546.28s -> 9549.27s]  You know, that's you get that you know that right? Holy shit
[9555.62s -> 9558.34s]  vertical gun
[9558.34s -> 9565.44s]  spider pod
[9565.44s -> 9567.68s]  Anchor up him. No, no, i'm talking about you guys
[9569.38s -> 9571.14s]  I'm talking about you
[9571.14s -> 9579.30s]  Not me. Yeah, you're scared me. What happened? You woke up on your own
[9580.69s -> 9585.25s]  No, no, no harry called me. I've got work to do. Oh, and i'm so proud of you having woken up yourself at once
[9586.39s -> 9587.51s]  Oh, yeah, right
[9587.51s -> 9591.81s]  Look, I have to go. I have to get to the diamond chinese restaurant. Oh damn it. That place is the best
[9592.29s -> 9595.01s]  The owner's a great chef. His name is dandodon. Tell him he said it
[9595.65s -> 9601.11s]  You can make anything ramen gyoza fried rice sour pork egg mani's pizza. Oh, it sounds delicious. I'm making my song
[9602.31s -> 9603.51s]  So where's him?
[9603.51s -> 9605.88s]  You don't know just go north in the lilies
[9605.88s -> 9628.84s]  Sorry, I had times to that on the youtube video diamond. It's time for a fight. What happened here body on the ground
[9629.24s -> 9633.84s]  Okay, this has happened. It's terrible
[9635.80s -> 9639.40s]  Hey dale, you're here. We were too late seems poor guy. He was dead before we came here
[9639.48s -> 9642.29s]  Looks like mental shock must have killed him
[9642.69s -> 9648.85s]  You could take real physical damage in a robo battle. If you die in the game, you die in real life
[9649.33s -> 9655.36s]  It takes a tremendous amount of stress to actually kill someone. I go to all the trouble of coming here in person
[9655.36s -> 9660.42s]  And this is what I get
[9660.42s -> 9662.98s]  How many layers down was he in the dream?
[9667.70s -> 9676.64s]  Right. No, i'm kidding. It was a joke. It was a joke. It was made. It was just deliberate farming
[9677.12s -> 9679.43s]  If it's a deliberate farm, it's not a minus two
[9679.59s -> 9682.23s]  It's an equals two
[9682.23s -> 9684.87s]  Equals two if it's a deliberate farm, don't you get that?
[9685.43s -> 9696.96s]  Cops are too busy to solve a murder. Apparently it was already too late when we arrived
[9697.52s -> 9701.94s]  We're late things have gotten pretty bad here
[9702.18s -> 9703.62s]  We have his cube
[9703.62s -> 9711.68s]  Harry, what are you doing here? We got a call, but it came too late. Whatever happened. It was over before we got here
[9712.71s -> 9714.63s]  bounty hunters, ah
[9714.63s -> 9717.28s]  We got it from here. So why don't you all beat it?
[9718.24s -> 9724.60s]  Hey, what we've got a job to do and you bounty hunters aren't a part of it. Oh, it's that show
[9725.24s -> 9730.50s]  Sure, you show up for these cases, but for the small ones you don't even bother. That's easy for you to say
[9731.57s -> 9736.15s]  You bounty hunters are free to pick your missions, but we police have far more responsibility
[9737.28s -> 9741.84s]  Where's the law then when's there? Where is it that regulates average folks needed? Huh?
[9742.32s -> 9744.92s]  Can't be bothered. Is that it?
[9744.92s -> 9750.47s]  You're not looking after the people who need you. Why do I even waste my time on a waster like you?
[9751.27s -> 9753.27s]  You're nothing like your sister
[9753.35s -> 9754.56s]  you
[9754.56s -> 9756.96s]  Leave it harry. It's out of our hands now
[9757.60s -> 9760.26s]  Harry, let's go. Come on dale
[9762.53s -> 9764.58s]  Wait, you got a minute
[9764.58s -> 9768.66s]  Roy according to the witness the victim was fighting some sort of
[9769.76s -> 9772.34s]  Autonomous robo
[9772.34s -> 9773.62s]  What did you say?
[9773.62s -> 9777.09s]  And when it killed the victim it fled the scene
[9777.65s -> 9783.19s]  Sounds like trouble
[9783.19s -> 9789.44s]  You really don't have a clue what's going on. Don't you an autonomous robo moves itself without having any commander dive into it
[9789.84s -> 9793.59s]  It was designed for manual and repetitive labor. I've never heard of that one fights
[9795.27s -> 9796.15s]  Oh
[9796.15s -> 9800.64s]  Which is why I have to ask you for a favor marcia
[9801.28s -> 9803.01s]  I need your help
[9803.01s -> 9804.13s]  What me?
[9804.13s -> 9806.56s]  You know what i'm going to ask you
[9806.64s -> 9811.28s]  I need to do a hack dive and read the victim's last thoughts
[9812.61s -> 9814.61s]  Skip the dialogue. Okay
[9818.37s -> 9821.89s]  You call that asking respected fellow law enforcement for help say like you mean it
[9822.93s -> 9824.45s]  What do you mean? No
[9824.45s -> 9829.83s]  Thank god. No, fuck you. What it was one guy more than one
[9830.64s -> 9831.84s]  What?
[9831.92s -> 9833.28s]  Shut it harry
[9833.28s -> 9835.04s]  I see your business is business
[9835.04s -> 9837.12s]  If you think you can take it and give the cops a hand
[9838.28s -> 9840.12s]  I don't know earnest
[9840.12s -> 9842.76s]  I haven't done a half dive in so long. I'm not even sure I still can
[9844.42s -> 9847.46s]  I'm not sure i'm following this but I don't think marcia can help out here
[9849.92s -> 9852.56s]  We need her to help though. There's no one else who can we can turn to
[9853.20s -> 9857.88s]  I see we understand if you can't do it if you fail, please help us for a bad audition
[9857.88s -> 9859.88s]  This is we're a tv show that I want to be on
[9862.64s -> 9864.40s]  Imagine coming in
[9864.48s -> 9867.28s]  Through an audition and you have an audition for one character
[9868.00s -> 9872.00s]  And you step in you can have these big sunglasses on you like no, no, no, no, no
[9872.00s -> 9876.16s]  No, you don't have to read from me. You don't have to get anybody to read i'm gonna do all of them
[9877.86s -> 9880.96s]  You do this
[9880.96s -> 9885.04s]  You is this impressive to an audition or is this like uh, this guy's kind of fucking weird
[9885.12s -> 9890.72s]  I don't know if I want this guy in here. All right. Let me concentrate
[9892.16s -> 9894.08s]  What's a half dive?
[9894.08s -> 9898.48s]  Uh, I know they just told me what a half dive is when they go in and they can pull the data out
[9899.12s -> 9901.30s]  What are they gonna do?
[9901.30s -> 9904.08s]  Just watch it's marcia's special power
[9904.72s -> 9908.48s]  Lord, I told you a while back marcia's had this special power since she was young
[9909.04s -> 9913.67s]  Marcia can dive into a robo that's already been registered by eye contact
[9914.23s -> 9917.36s]  Doesn't mean she can control a pre-registered robo though
[9918.00s -> 9921.57s]  However, she's able to read the commander's remaining cognition
[9922.50s -> 9925.54s]  So whatever the commander saw through his robo's eyes she sees
[9926.36s -> 9933.38s]  You can even read that guy's last thoughts gruesome. I'm an unboxing youtuber. No
[9936.16s -> 9939.75s]  No, all right, she's gonna half dive
[9940.39s -> 9946.40s]  Marcia, what's wrong? What happened?
[9946.64s -> 9948.64s]  Hey, i'll calm down. I'll explain later
[9948.96s -> 9951.01s]  How'd it go? What did you find?
[9951.01s -> 9955.04s]  It just cuts to like he's at the drive-through
[9955.36s -> 9957.04s]  It's weird boring shit
[9957.04s -> 9961.68s]  He's ordering like a number two or something and then he just comes in here and lies on the ground and dies
[9962.64s -> 9965.59s]  He wasn't fighting a custom robo
[9966.07s -> 9969.48s]  What do you mean?
[9969.48s -> 9973.00s]  Didn't look like a robo. I've never seen anything like it. It was like a living thing
[9973.80s -> 9977.00s]  That's ridiculous no living thing can enter the hall as am
[9977.56s -> 9980.16s]  You're right. It's just not possible
[9980.16s -> 9983.52s]  Everything about it is different. It doesn't move like a robot doesn't even look like one
[9985.99s -> 9987.59s]  You see what it was?
[9987.59s -> 9990.71s]  Only vaguely. It's just i've heard enough. There's no way that could happen
[9992.21s -> 9993.73s]  Shut up broy
[9993.73s -> 9995.49s]  Marcia what just what?
[9995.49s -> 9997.70s]  I've never felt such
[9997.70s -> 9999.70s]  overwhelming power
[9999.86s -> 10009.67s]  Come with us to hq. We'll want to make a composite sketch of the robo you saw
[10010.31s -> 10016.42s]  Hey, whoa there look at her marcy is in bad shape the stress of the half-dive is getting to her
[10017.14s -> 10020.15s]  I see what she has to go through every time she does this
[10020.79s -> 10025.36s]  We're sorry about that. But as a citizen she must comply with any and all police squad orders
[10025.92s -> 10029.14s]  unlimited power
[10029.14s -> 10032.66s]  Why we're asking for the cooperation not their resentment be civil
[10035.03s -> 10036.15s]  Forgive me
[10036.15s -> 10038.71s]  As if look at you barking like a dog
[10039.67s -> 10042.55s]  Still taking orders from my own sister loser
[10044.84s -> 10046.60s]  Harry you're out of line
[10047.36s -> 10049.36s]  Thank you for your hard work marcia
[10049.52s -> 10052.82s]  You must understand that this is extremely important and we desperately need your help
[10053.38s -> 10056.74s]  I know you're feeling a little weak, but we won't ask you to do anything strenuous. I promise
[10057.70s -> 10060.74s]  Please come with us to hq and tell us more about your power
[10061.80s -> 10065.72s]  Please hq marcia. Are you all right? You can rest up if you're not feeling up to it. Yeah
[10066.36s -> 10069.64s]  Just don't over exert. We'll be all right. We got you back. Bye
[10070.28s -> 10077.40s]  Hey harry, let's go
[10077.40s -> 10079.64s]  This is a visual novel people happy
[10079.64s -> 10087.12s]  Marcia
[10089.94s -> 10096.40s]  It kind of is yeah, but okay, it's a visual novel with really fun shit sprinkled sometimes in the game
[10098.12s -> 10106.66s]  It still has my attention. It's taking marcia so long. I wonder if she's okay
[10107.46s -> 10111.09s]  Marcia will be fine. She's got a strong will she's not like you
[10111.81s -> 10117.88s]  It's not nice marcia was so willing to help those cops. I mean she hardly argued at all
[10118.98s -> 10122.34s]  Hey harry, what's so special about a half-time? Why can't anyone else do it?
[10124.10s -> 10127.38s]  I don't know. It's a rare talent. I've never met anyone who could do it
[10128.60s -> 10132.12s]  Really, but there might be others. I've never even heard about a half-dive before now
[10133.51s -> 10139.83s]  Well, according to my sister marcia is the only commander. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you can do a half-dive. Whoa, that's insane
[10140.39s -> 10145.91s]  Well, she's something all right, but it doesn't sound all that great. Her power makes her extremely sensitive emotionally speaking. I mean
[10146.95s -> 10151.35s]  Oh, so for example, you ever have times when there's something on your mind
[10152.15s -> 10154.71s]  Would you get worried?
[10154.71s -> 10156.71s]  well in marcia's case
[10157.11s -> 10160.36s]  Take those worries and multiply them by a hundred
[10161.35s -> 10163.43s]  She gets so stressed out. She just freezes
[10165.92s -> 10172.37s]  That's pretty sensitive
[10172.37s -> 10175.33s]  Uh, yeah, she's been like that since she was a child. Okay
[10176.13s -> 10180.53s]  That's why she seems so distant. She needs the distance to keep from getting hurt by people
[10181.09s -> 10182.82s]  See it's like this
[10182.82s -> 10184.82s]  I see his big brother always used to protect her
[10185.30s -> 10188.31s]  It's rough being that sensitive and losing both your parents and your brother
[10189.09s -> 10192.85s]  Yeah, she really sort of hit rock bottom. It took a lot of work for marcia to get to where she is now
[10193.41s -> 10196.10s]  Uh, hey, that's enough out of you
[10196.26s -> 10203.35s]  I even catch you guys treating her differently because of this. I'll whoop you both good. It's the phone. Maybe it's marcia
[10204.82s -> 10206.34s]  How sensitive is she?
[10206.34s -> 10208.21s]  I don't know
[10208.21s -> 10210.21s]  Barry I got I think she's pretty sensitive
[10213.04s -> 10220.40s]  Jill hearts your squeal you squeal will deal is his artist. Uh bogey. Sorry about yesterday
[10221.03s -> 10225.11s]  Yeah, I knew he was a wanted man. I forgot my robo. That's why I couldn't catch him on the spot
[10226.34s -> 10230.74s]  What oh I get it you gave dark blue the job yesterday. So now you're handing one down to us today
[10231.86s -> 10233.27s]  Thank you
[10233.27s -> 10236.55s]  You're absolutely right. I'm a very loyal customer. Your cafe has great atmosphere
[10237.43s -> 10239.43s]  Oh, you're starting a poetry slam night
[10240.07s -> 10242.07s]  What makes you think that I write poetry?
[10243.35s -> 10244.63s]  You saw that
[10244.63s -> 10254.02s]  Well outside the boy's over right now. All right, we've got work get over to bogeys pronto
[10254.82s -> 10257.14s]  Tutorial this is not this tutorial. It's been three hours
[10257.92s -> 10260.48s]  Seems like there's some guy making a killing on battle wagers
[10260.80s -> 10265.09s]  Oh, he said the guy's incredibly strong and he's gonna put bogey out of business if this keeps up
[10265.57s -> 10272.12s]  Oh, you're not coming earnest. I don't think so. I feel like a bad luck right now
[10272.52s -> 10276.88s]  I got some light filing to do. Yeah, sure. Hurry up
[10280.05s -> 10295.99s]  Oh go go go go go go go go bogeys cafe. Here it is time for a fight
[10298.58s -> 10300.58s]  Thanks for the call at your service
[10302.26s -> 10304.26s]  Well, hello
[10304.34s -> 10312.79s]  I've been waiting for you harry and you too dale. Oh great. Not you. Here you go. Let's fight
[10313.35s -> 10316.47s]  I'll give you the tldr
[10316.55s -> 10318.85s]  bad guy versus good guy
[10318.93s -> 10320.93s]  Trying to teach why is his hands up?
[10321.17s -> 10328.50s]  We would have resolved the situation right away, but bogey insisted that we gave you still hearts fellow a fair shot
[10329.06s -> 10333.88s]  In fair spare of course, we're waiting till you screw up. There's fair bogey called us. Not you. This is our job
[10333.96s -> 10337.48s]  Oh, please harry. Are you even listening? We're mercenaries. The job goes to the fastest team
[10338.12s -> 10342.80s]  We're a generous group we dark blue mercenaries. We'll fight. How about two on two?
[10356.13s -> 10363.43s]  Nope, did you hear all those breaths?
[10364.71s -> 10366.71s]  I want to see the new things we got
[10367.35s -> 10370.55s]  Vertical this is so cool. There's 13 pages of guns
[10371.59s -> 10382.07s]  But unfortunately, there's 13 pages of dialogue as well between every single scene. I want to try vertical
[10386.68s -> 10391.04s]  Keep standard. I like the standard. I've got a new one of these two tonight
[10392.39s -> 10397.91s]  Good spider remains in place when deployed and homes in on a target that approaches
[10398.71s -> 10399.67s]  That's right
[10399.67s -> 10402.71s]  What is a vertical two rounds straight?
[10403.43s -> 10406.64s]  And two more vertical
[10406.64s -> 10408.08s]  Oh, okay
[10408.08s -> 10411.84s]  You can clear walls the vertical one's clear walls. All right, that's awesome
[10412.40s -> 10417.84s]  What does the feather do decreases jump speed makes you less vulnerable to attacks when landing?
[10418.40s -> 10423.24s]  Also makes to help make sharp turns on the ground. Let's try this
[10424.04s -> 10434.77s]  It looks pretty cool
[10434.77s -> 10443.09s]  All right, let's do it
[10443.09s -> 10445.09s]  Six seconds. What?
[10445.09s -> 10446.85s]  I've been mashing
[10446.85s -> 10455.75s]  Get over there get over. Oh, whoa
[10459.14s -> 10460.66s]  Wait, the spider
[10460.66s -> 10463.06s]  Spider is weird
[10463.06s -> 10468.98s]  Do a live commentary. I'm almost dead
[10470.02s -> 10471.86s]  How am I almost dead? No
[10471.86s -> 10483.57s]  Get out of the tutorial. I'm trying
[10487.64s -> 10488.68s]  we're like
[10488.68s -> 10489.80s]  like
[10489.80s -> 10492.60s]  Eight tenths of the game's dialogue is not much I can do
[10493.32s -> 10500.16s]  Where's my partner? What is he doing over there?
[10501.46s -> 10507.52s]  I'm gonna lose
[10507.52s -> 10508.64s]  We're dead
[10508.64s -> 10520.80s]  I think we're supposed to lose
[10521.36s -> 10525.17s]  Scripted
[10525.17s -> 10529.33s]  Celebrating how is it for you? Did you learn anything other than the meaning of shame scripted?
[10529.89s -> 10536.13s]  Let me tell you a little bit about two on two and a two on two battle
[10536.13s -> 10538.21s]  You partner's gunshots and charges won't hurt you
[10539.25s -> 10541.25s]  Still take damage if you get fight apart. Yeah
[10542.05s -> 10544.05s]  I got it. Will we get a second chance?
[10544.64s -> 10546.64s]  Full throttle, let's go
[10549.09s -> 10550.77s]  Sorry, he's new
[10550.77s -> 10553.78s]  All right. I want to go back to what I was using before
[10554.26s -> 10568.32s]  Tim and ip get the spider off. I don't like it that much cockroach is the way to go feather get rid of it long thrust
[10569.04s -> 10571.12s]  That's my guy right here
[10571.12s -> 10574.45s]  Wait, I got I have a new robot
[10577.40s -> 10583.08s]  I'm sorry. There's so much talking in this game that I forgot that like I forgot some stuff that I actually unlocked
[10583.72s -> 10589.56s]  The you unlocked this thing is one sentence squished in between like 300 sentences
[10590.28s -> 10597.30s]  I think red
[10597.30s -> 10603.72s]  red
[10603.72s -> 10607.49s]  Uh, i'm gonna keep this one. Yeah, let's try him
[10618.74s -> 10627.67s]  Bam, what the fuck? Why am I so slow?
[10639.09s -> 10640.93s]  Those cockroaches out
[10640.93s -> 10655.03s]  Cockroaches cockroaches cockroaches. You gotta bully this guy back here
[10655.67s -> 10663.41s]  Holy bully bully bully good
[10663.41s -> 10666.64s]  All right, this guy's toast
[10666.64s -> 10673.44s]  Yeah roaches the best for sure knock him down. I'll get him with this
[10674.24s -> 10676.93s]  I'll come down knock him down get a knock down
[10677.41s -> 10687.65s]  Cockroaches are by far the best item in the game
[10688.21s -> 10697.88s]  Let's get back to the story already
[10699.91s -> 10701.11s]  I
[10701.11s -> 10702.79s]  Got two more puns
[10702.79s -> 10709.09s]  Oh exhilarating how best to measure one skill than to permit him to have victory. Did you learn something?
[10709.65s -> 10711.41s]  Certainly. Hope you did
[10711.41s -> 10714.16s]  Why don't we talk about my story?
[10714.72s -> 10716.72s]  You see when I was a young boy
[10717.52s -> 10721.76s]  My father left me and my mother left too and then I decided I was good
[10722.56s -> 10732.47s]  Thank god. I'm gonna go off script. No, i'm going i'm staying on script but quick
[10734.74s -> 10737.94s]  We beat him can't even own up to it. Anyway, that was a nice little waste of our time
[10737.94s -> 10739.62s]  Now we'd better get back to work
[10739.62s -> 10743.01s]  Okay bogey, where can we find this guy you're after?
[10743.81s -> 10745.41s]  How's that door?
[10745.41s -> 10747.57s]  oh
[10747.57s -> 10752.77s]  That's a false wall. There's a door hidden there. We hold robo battles in the back room
[10753.33s -> 10755.83s]  This guy's been winning every match and i'm losing money
[10759.57s -> 10762.13s]  Stop pretending to read don't read stop pretending
[10763.89s -> 10766.15s]  Okay
[10766.15s -> 10769.99s]  Well, I mean what is illegal? Anyway, I mean it's such a vague term, you know
[10770.95s -> 10773.84s]  I get it. That's why you called us instead of the cops. You didn't want to get busted
[10775.00s -> 10777.16s]  It is 3d movie maker. This is the same exact
[10777.86s -> 10783.32s]  Restaurant and in fact, it's like the same actor behind the counter. This is the same shot
[10785.86s -> 10787.86s]  Maybe when you're older, you'll understand
[10788.02s -> 10790.20s]  Listen, don't tell anyone. Okay
[10792.68s -> 10794.68s]  Harry, all right, what's in it for me?
[10794.76s -> 10798.60s]  I mean I could be quiet about it or I can be real noisy
[10799.32s -> 10801.72s]  Hey, hey, don't be that way. You'll get paid. Well, if you pull this off
[10802.28s -> 10806.13s]  All right, keep your mouth shut dale. Let's go. I appreciate your discretion
[10806.69s -> 10817.22s]  Is that for all
[10817.22s -> 10821.40s]  We should chat up the crowd for some info before we sign up
[10827.62s -> 10829.62s]  Left flank bomb. What else do I get?
[10830.40s -> 10831.92s]  ain't pod f
[10831.92s -> 10835.22s]  pretty cool
[10835.22s -> 10838.45s]  Let's chat up crowd
[10838.45s -> 10843.41s]  Mentoring the next tournament. I'll probably bump into one of you depending on how they mix up the entries
[10844.47s -> 10846.87s]  Pardon me, but are you the one who's been winning all the matches?
[10847.75s -> 10851.03s]  You got the wrong person buddy. You want to talk to shiner?
[10851.83s -> 10854.55s]  He's in the waiting room right now with the other combatants. Mm-hmm
[10855.51s -> 10857.19s]  Okay, I wonder who he is
[10857.19s -> 10862.71s]  Okay, it has probably has to be you. No, it could be you. It's probably you one of you two back here
[10862.71s -> 10864.23s]  No, it can't be you
[10864.23s -> 10868.95s]  Can't be the only person with an actual video game model that was made. You're not the guy
[10871.86s -> 10874.58s]  No, I have the phantom of the opera thing in front of my face
[10876.39s -> 10879.48s]  No, that's not him
[10879.48s -> 10883.16s]  I keep betting on the underdog, but shiner keeps beating them. I'll never break even now
[10883.72s -> 10889.43s]  The guy over there hasn't placed one bet. He's just been sitting there watching the battles
[10890.07s -> 10893.09s]  What's he even doing here?
[10893.09s -> 10896.48s]  Wait, is this not the guy?
[10896.48s -> 10900.64s]  Shiner's been winning all the matches. So it's no fun to bet. That's why it's slow today
[10903.40s -> 10906.61s]  Hmm
[10906.61s -> 10908.61s]  You might as well just write
[10908.67s -> 10912.85s]  Mua h mua mua ha ha ha
[10913.57s -> 10924.44s]  Today just ain't my day. I'll barely break even if I bet on shiner and he's the odds-on favorite
[10924.92s -> 10927.80s]  But nobody's gonna beat shiners. There's no point in betting on anybody else
[10928.44s -> 10937.51s]  Is this shiner? You must be harry and dale
[10938.31s -> 10941.19s]  Mogi told me you'd be coming. Are you ready to fight?
[10941.83s -> 10948.07s]  No, not yet. He needs some time to talk to all the creeps around here. I understand i'll be ready when you are ready
[10949.60s -> 10951.28s]  I talked to everybody already
[10951.28s -> 10956.96s]  Day in my day did I talk?
[10956.96s -> 10959.60s]  Sorry guys, but i'm gonna take shiner down and claim the prize
[10960.24s -> 10964.60s]  Who did I not talk to?
[10964.60s -> 10974.92s]  If you enter the battle tournament, you can win big and get badly beat though
[10978.42s -> 10981.41s]  Day in my day
[10981.41s -> 10983.41s]  Shiner's been winning all the games. Where is he?
[10983.97s -> 10992.82s]  You must be harry
[10992.82s -> 10998.39s]  We're hosting a battle tournament with 16 commanders. I was just making the entry list for the next tournament
[10999.43s -> 11001.27s]  16 I hope we get to play
[11001.27s -> 11003.97s]  I'm determining your entry position now. Hold on a moment
[11009.48s -> 11011.49s]  16
[11011.49s -> 11014.29s]  All the way at the back of the mario kart line, right? Uh-huh
[11014.93s -> 11022.07s]  Dale is number nine which one's been winning all the matches
[11022.87s -> 11024.87s]  Well, that will be shiner entry number one
[11025.19s -> 11028.20s]  He's number one. I'm number 16
[11028.60s -> 11030.28s]  And dale is number nine
[11030.72s -> 11034.16s]  Dang according to this he we won't get a chance to face him until finals
[11035.65s -> 11038.47s]  That means that dale and I have to fight each other in the semi-finals
[11039.33s -> 11044.69s]  What season two of every anime ever the season fucking the entire season is this whole thing
[11045.25s -> 11048.55s]  You can skip season two of every anime that's ever existed
[11049.35s -> 11051.88s]  What?
[11051.88s -> 11057.54s]  Can't we change?
[11057.54s -> 11061.14s]  Sorry, everything's done by computers. It's totally random. I can't change your number for you
[11061.62s -> 11067.59s]  I start messing around with the numbers. The guests will think i'm fixing the matches
[11069.14s -> 11073.46s]  I thought bogey set this up for us. Oh man. Well, I guess we'll just have to win your tournament
[11074.02s -> 11077.56s]  Please wait here. I'll call you when it's your turn. Please call me when it's my turn
[11078.20s -> 11090.76s]  Is it my turn?
[11090.76s -> 11094.12s]  We can't leave
[11094.12s -> 11096.12s]  Uh, excuse me. Is it my turn yet?
[11097.19s -> 11101.27s]  Are you ready to go? Make sure you check the parts generator. I'm ready. You said you were gonna call me
[11101.83s -> 11109.80s]  First battle will be dale versus paulie
[11111.92s -> 11115.04s]  That's right. It's me paulie your original character
[11116.66s -> 11119.94s]  You thought you could say make paul and then just delete him no
[11121.22s -> 11125.14s]  I exist
[11125.14s -> 11128.74s]  Go for a deal. Don't worry. I've got tons of advice to get you through this
[11133.91s -> 11137.19s]  Tons of advice. That's not fair. That should be disqualified. I win by default
[11137.75s -> 11140.05s]  Hey chill. I'm not fighting. I'm just watching
[11140.69s -> 11142.69s]  Hang on. Aren't you a cop?
[11142.77s -> 11146.92s]  What's an upright member of the police squad like yourself doing in a place like this?
[11149.60s -> 11152.55s]  Not so loud. How could you tell?
[11152.55s -> 11154.55s]  You know, he's wearing his uniform
[11155.33s -> 11158.61s]  Wait a minute. You're those guys who busted the lab burglary
[11159.49s -> 11161.91s]  You must have recognized my distinctive features
[11164.60s -> 11167.99s]  More like your distinctive uniform pops all look the same to me
[11169.59s -> 11172.95s]  So wait, that means that you're one of those guys the burglars beat up
[11173.97s -> 11175.97s]  And you're one of those guys who shuts up
[11177.00s -> 11180.60s]  Insurance didn't cover any of my bills. So i'm trying to make some scratch on the side. Okay
[11183.30s -> 11187.78s]  Listen guys, i'm sure you've got lots to catch up on but we're trying to hold a tournament here
[11188.74s -> 11191.06s]  I'm gonna do better this time this time i'm in it for the money
[11191.62s -> 11193.81s]  Yeah, whatever you say
[11193.81s -> 11196.40s]  Okay, my advice for you is to beat this guy up but good
[11200.56s -> 11202.56s]  enough dialogue i'm trying
[11203.52s -> 11206.16s]  This guy's using a strike vanisher model. Let me explain
[11206.96s -> 11209.92s]  Like the shining fighter the strike manager's model
[11210.48s -> 11214.40s]  The bullies are well balanced but the biggest difference is that it has a stealth function
[11215.36s -> 11220.16s]  Stealth function if you do an air dash this function will make your robo disappear
[11221.19s -> 11226.08s]  Dodging incoming gunfire compared to a shining fighter model it moves slowly
[11226.72s -> 11232.60s]  I just i'm i'm like yawning now you guys made me yawn because you said yawn
[11237.27s -> 11242.87s]  Wouldn't everybody if you're going to use a strike manager take advantage of its stealth ability to dodge got it
[11244.71s -> 11249.48s]  Why?
[11249.48s -> 11254.44s]  And one more thing is a holoseum called a diamond cell that the police squad use
[11255.08s -> 11261.40s]  There's a magma zone in that holoseum. So be careful. Oh, yeah, it's that red stuff. Don't step in it
[11261.88s -> 11265.24s]  How's that irony though? You're not a crook, but you're fighting a cop comedy
[11267.56s -> 11272.02s]  Harry can I play the game now? Oh, yes. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Yes. Yes
[11272.74s -> 11276.87s]  The gatling guns took it up
[11276.87s -> 11283.78s]  I like the ape
[11283.78s -> 11287.27s]  So much stuff. I wish I would just be able to play and unlock
[11287.91s -> 11293.11s]  All right faint f stops in front of its target and to play two at one time
[11293.83s -> 11296.23s]  Can I get another one?
[11296.23s -> 11310.00s]  I mean, you kind of have to try everything once right? I did vertical. I didn't like it. Let's try this
[11310.32s -> 11320.18s]  All right, don't stand in the lava mash
[11334.72s -> 11335.84s]  Ooh
[11335.84s -> 11337.44s]  These are kind of cool. I like these
[11337.44s -> 11359.52s]  What the fuck was that? He just lagged. Oh, that's the stealth feature. Okay
[11360.24s -> 11372.10s]  It's a shitty connection. I don't even know what that does. I don't lose don't lose in the tournament
[11377.84s -> 11389.84s]  Play smart
[11389.84s -> 11390.96s]  shit
[11390.96s -> 11395.44s]  You're gonna lose in the first round. I'm not gonna lose in the first round
[11400.84s -> 11403.80s]  If I lose in this round, I will get 25 000 subs
[11404.44s -> 11429.32s]  I'm good. Don't have to do that access to the javelin. I couldn't have drawn an easier first match so much for paying my bills
[11430.60s -> 11432.60s]  Skills like those. How do you ever get to be a cop?
[11435.08s -> 11437.08s]  That's like pretty sad, isn't it?
[11438.18s -> 11440.18s]  Why shake hand this guy a hundred dollars?
[11440.66s -> 11442.02s]  Right
[11442.02s -> 11443.86s]  That's I feel bad
[11443.86s -> 11446.68s]  All right next fight
[11446.68s -> 11451.22s]  That's a new uh, that's a new
[11451.28s -> 11461.62s]  Robotype
[11461.62s -> 11465.56s]  Javelin strike vanisher model. Oh, this is one of the stealth ones. I'll try it
[11466.28s -> 11470.21s]  I'm like the criminal one
[11470.21s -> 11473.73s]  All right javelin and yeah yellow
[11478.42s -> 11479.86s]  Hmm
[11479.86s -> 11481.30s]  I'll try to get this to work
[11481.30s -> 11485.08s]  Remember, what do I do with my channel points?
[11485.72s -> 11487.72s]  Um, you just hold on to them forever
[11488.80s -> 11491.67s]  Pretty much what's gonna happen?
[11491.67s -> 11493.27s]  Uh cockroach
[11493.27s -> 11504.55s]  Holy shit, I can do that
[11504.55s -> 11508.13s]  All right, let's go
[11508.13s -> 11510.23s]  round two
[11510.23s -> 11512.71s]  No, not this shit. Not this just don't do this
[11512.87s -> 11517.19s]  This is like the only thing you guys use channel points for is the one thing that I haven't disabled
[11517.83s -> 11519.83s]  And that's the purple text that takes over
[11519.91s -> 11524.71s]  It's the only thing that you can do besides the emote changes and it's 1200 and I know at least
[11525.11s -> 11529.75s]  Two to three thousand of you have like 20 million channel points. So this could go on forever
[11530.55s -> 11532.55s]  You could this some of you guys that this is
[11533.11s -> 11535.19s]  Like a nickel to a lot of you guys
[11535.75s -> 11540.79s]  All right. I won my first match too shine. I won his match
[11541.51s -> 11544.26s]  We're going to because this is dad again
[11544.34s -> 11546.64s]  Have a clean fight
[11546.64s -> 11549.92s]  Isn't that the one guy who got in a fight with his wife? Yes, it is
[11550.72s -> 11553.57s]  What are you doing in this place?
[11553.57s -> 11556.93s]  Well, it's like this my wife handles all our money and I don't get much allowance
[11557.01s -> 11559.41s]  So I figured this would be a good way to make some extra money
[11560.05s -> 11562.15s]  You want allowance?
[11562.15s -> 11567.92s]  You better believe it by the way, I have a favor to ask could you take it easy on me, you know
[11567.92s -> 11570.23s]  So I could win
[11570.23s -> 11572.60s]  No, I want to win
[11572.60s -> 11584.08s]  Highlight my message. I have to delete channel points. I think where you're going to fire when you use that pot
[11584.08s -> 11587.44s]  You can do all kinds of things with the pod pod pod pod pod pod. Yeah
[11588.40s -> 11591.16s]  Uh-huh. Thank you deal
[11591.64s -> 11594.13s]  Wake up i'll say it again. Oh no
[11595.01s -> 11598.90s]  We just made him do it again
[11598.90s -> 11603.32s]  Remember you lost the chat hours ago
[11603.72s -> 11604.84s]  Did I?
[11604.84s -> 11611.48s]  Did I lose the chat hours ago? I feel like I didn't
[11611.96s -> 11613.80s]  I don't think we've been talking
[11613.80s -> 11617.97s]  We've been having a conversation. We've been hanging out
[11618.93s -> 11626.04s]  That's a cool type. Was it a super type? That's a that's a dr. Robotnik type. I want that one
[11626.52s -> 11641.67s]  Let's try the javelin beanbag sonic robot. Yeah
[11642.39s -> 11645.68s]  This is a cool area too. All right. Why am I not being able to get this?
[11646.40s -> 11648.24s]  Just draw here. All right, go
[11648.24s -> 11654.13s]  Here we go
[11654.13s -> 11656.37s]  And this thing actually works pretty well when it's a slow
[11657.41s -> 11666.08s]  Holy shit, this is awesome
[11666.08s -> 11668.08s]  vertical with the sky
[11685.64s -> 11694.61s]  Oh just get him rebirth. Hey. Hey, what speaking of rebirth?
[11696.21s -> 11700.29s]  Wasn't there a new binding of isaac thing that's supposed to come out like two years ago? What happened to that?
[11701.09s -> 11703.80s]  That out
[11703.80s -> 11716.47s]  Go get him roaches go
[11716.47s -> 11718.47s]  Yeah, like redemption or something or
[11719.35s -> 11721.35s]  Repentance or something whatever it's called
[11728.74s -> 11733.75s]  Yeah, come on. I'm gonna get in closer to drop these roaches
[11746.37s -> 11757.91s]  Get him roaches. You can do that three times. Holy shit
[11758.71s -> 11766.31s]  This character is really good
[11766.31s -> 11770.21s]  We need to play x-men origins
[11770.21s -> 11777.76s]  What do you mean watch the movie on stream because I can't do that left five-way gunner?
[11778.24s -> 11792.74s]  I'll never afford that lovely toupee now. What was the name of that robo game that I played? Wait, what'd you say?
[11793.54s -> 11798.82s]  What was the name of that robo game that germa played a while ago? That was almost like this. It's called gotcha force
[11799.94s -> 11803.81s]  And it is incredible
[11803.81s -> 11806.93s]  That is a fantastic video game. I love every second of it
[11812.56s -> 11814.42s]  Semi-finals are going here. We go
[11814.42s -> 11820.82s]  This is worse than that
[11820.82s -> 11825.62s]  Are you implying that gotcha force is not a good game because if you are then that is a permaban on this channel
[11826.34s -> 11831.70s]  And uh-huh permaban. It's gonna be like a minute. No, no, no, no like you are removed from the you are removed forever
[11832.34s -> 11836.74s]  Yeah, I will I will make sure that you are banned permanently and you don't get to chat ever again
[11839.17s -> 11842.85s]  Like oh, yeah, that's really funny. Like i'm gonna ban you for like a minute like we no, no, no, absolutely not
[11843.09s -> 11847.01s]  You make you say gotcha force sucks. Be careful playing with fire
[11854.12s -> 11861.96s]  Everyone's gonna be banned the higher you jump the more vulnerable you become same goes for an air dash
[11864.85s -> 11871.96s]  Me versus you
[11871.96s -> 11874.04s]  I didn't watch that stream with a happy face
[11876.44s -> 11878.92s]  Edit your comment and make that a sad face
[11879.72s -> 11880.76s]  or
[11880.76s -> 11883.38s]  You know what that is
[11883.38s -> 11886.84s]  I'm gonna keep this. I like this. Wait, what was the new thing I got?
[11887.56s -> 11892.74s]  Five ways something right?
[11892.74s -> 11898.34s]  Fires five rounds that spread to the left side the rounds turn in the opposite direction when fired from the air
[11899.06s -> 11900.52s]  That's right
[11900.52s -> 11911.08s]  Give me mod privilege and i'll edit it
[11911.40s -> 11913.40s]  Yeah, i'll give you a mod dude
[11914.77s -> 11916.77s]  Fucking hell freezes over
[11916.77s -> 11926.50s]  I like this one. Holy shit. This one's perfect. This is the spreader from contra three
[11929.32s -> 11933.88s]  Most satisfying weapon in any video game is the spreader from contra three and it's in this game
[11934.60s -> 11954.50s]  Get him roaches get him. He's got roaches, too
[11955.14s -> 11966.36s]  It's got good spread, but it doesn't do very much damage
[11967.00s -> 11977.48s]  I get a hit
[11977.48s -> 11982.26s]  I have to be on that stupid thing
[11982.26s -> 11992.63s]  Hurry and get him. I just hit myself with my own bomb
[11996.79s -> 11999.27s]  Shit. Oh, no, he's just styling on me now
[11999.91s -> 12022.61s]  the health
[12022.61s -> 12024.61s]  Lost to harry pepe low
[12028.96s -> 12035.25s]  That's my it's a new guy I haven't played with him do I lose the tournament
[12040.23s -> 12043.27s]  You're still a novice. So i'll give you just a bit more advice the higher you jump
[12043.35s -> 12045.35s]  Wait, is he gonna give you another chance?
[12047.49s -> 12050.77s]  So I can't lose the tournament. Let's go at it for real this time
[12051.33s -> 12058.16s]  Yeah, the game is save scumming for me
[12058.88s -> 12062.52s]  All right. I know I I know his little bullshit watch this
[12064.64s -> 12066.79s]  back to the ape
[12066.79s -> 12068.47s]  green hulk ape
[12068.47s -> 12074.44s]  Back to vertical. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. No. Yeah
[12077.57s -> 12079.78s]  flank h
[12079.78s -> 12082.10s]  Cockroach is all right, but I think I want speed d for this
[12082.82s -> 12095.30s]  Guys, he's pretending to know the strategy of the game
[12095.94s -> 12099.78s]  Do you hear the confidence in his voice?
[12099.94s -> 12110.50s]  That was my mistake. He's not using this
[12121.76s -> 12130.40s]  Why did mine hit the wall and he's been over the wall and i'm speed
[12140.90s -> 12141.86s]  Close
[12141.86s -> 12150.95s]  I didn't say shb
[12161.62s -> 12168.08s]  Where's the juggler
[12168.08s -> 12183.57s]  pirate
[12183.57s -> 12186.45s]  Eat that shb. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[12188.82s -> 12190.58s]  Heard that one before
[12190.58s -> 12199.68s]  I win
[12199.68s -> 12214.77s]  Monkey always wins the boost pod and we're gonna fight the guy i'm the fan of the opera mask
[12215.09s -> 12218.55s]  I think you'd be so good. I've trained you well
[12219.19s -> 12223.08s]  I didn't feel like going full strength on you. Heh
[12223.80s -> 12227.25s]  You're our man. Make sure you don't screw up because this is an important job
[12227.73s -> 12229.73s]  All right is shiner gonna let me win
[12229.97s -> 12234.56s]  if I lose
[12234.56s -> 12241.35s]  boost pod time for the finals
[12247.12s -> 12259.27s]  That's shiner. It's time for the finals. You have between shiner and our newest star. I've never seen this guy before
[12262.18s -> 12266.26s]  Doesn't matter what you do. Everyone will bet on me. I'm the best
[12266.98s -> 12270.12s]  No one wants to throw away his money on an obvious loser
[12271.27s -> 12275.99s]  You know what? I don't care about all these losers make this place a profit
[12276.63s -> 12279.00s]  As long as i'm to waluigi
[12281.30s -> 12284.10s]  That's not even close to waluigi
[12285.84s -> 12292.15s]  Even close
[12292.15s -> 12297.83s]  As long as i'm making money and the masses go weak at the knees when they see me i'm happy
[12300.24s -> 12303.43s]  That's such a stretch
[12303.43s -> 12305.99s]  So tell me are you jealous of my skill?
[12306.72s -> 12307.92s]  Do you
[12307.92s -> 12309.12s]  Hate me
[12309.12s -> 12311.19s]  Hey, what do you say?
