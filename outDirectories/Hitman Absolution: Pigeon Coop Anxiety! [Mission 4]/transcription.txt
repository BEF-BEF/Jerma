[0.31s -> 12.44s]  Hey, welcome back ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Hitman Absolution.
[13.08s -> 21.39s]  Currently evading a helicopter right now. So, uh, hi welcome to the show and welcome. Let's go. Just helicopter BEE!
[22.23s -> 29.94s]  How can this thing see me? Oh my word!
[30.56s -> 32.56s]  This thing is just lighting up the room.
[32.96s -> 37.21s]  Just stop like just jumping around. Just go, go man.
[41.53s -> 43.73s]  Go, just sprint. It's over, go.
[45.61s -> 47.91s]  I'm getting taken hits here.
[48.15s -> 52.82s]  Get me the hell.
[53.67s -> 62.82s]  I didn't do that. That was not the animation I was doing. Is there still a guard up here?
[62.82s -> 79.19s]  I thought I was done. There's more. All right, this guy's right here. Whoa. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[79.71s -> 89.62s]  Damn it. Oh, damn it. Oh, damn it. Oh, damn it. Oh, damn it. Oh, damn it.
[89.84s -> 107.98s]  Where's the copper? The chopper? The chopper? Where's the chopper? Go, go hide from the helicopter.
[108.50s -> 113.61s]  Two cops, three cops over there, it looks like.
[114.25s -> 119.25s]  Damn, man, how on earth do you expect me to get by?
[119.97s -> 132.90s]  Go! Where's the helicopter? No, it's coming back, coming back.
[144.04s -> 146.04s]  Ex-military.
[150.95s -> 152.95s]  Can't go anywhere right now.
[155.31s -> 162.07s]  Hello, where you going? Where's your route? You don't have a route. Yes, you do. Yes, you do. Both have a route.
[164.89s -> 173.14s]  Oh, get out of here, man. No, I'm gonna have to go back this way.
[173.70s -> 179.74s]  No, I'm not. Perfect. Copper, get out. Get out of here, chopper. You're blowing my moves. Get out of here.
[180.02s -> 190.98s]  Good. The back, it looks like, maybe. What about that guy's all the way down there?
[200.17s -> 202.13s]  I should have made a move.
[202.13s -> 211.51s]  Should have made my move. Should have made my freaking move. It's time to make my move. Here we go.
[212.23s -> 214.71s]  Let's go. Make the move, make the move, make the move, make the move.
[215.19s -> 225.81s]  The helicopter can see me. This guy's gonna make his way back this way, and then I'm home free. That's the door right there.
[226.69s -> 230.50s]  Wait until the car, the chopper is... Oh, shoot.
[231.14s -> 235.18s]  Get out of my way.
[235.18s -> 246.96s]  Damn it. You prick. If I still had that hammer, I would have thrown it by now.
[247.28s -> 251.98s]  I'm going for a run. Right when this guy goes back the other way, I'm going for a run.
[251.98s -> 254.28s]  I'm just running the other way into the, I'm just gonna run.
[254.90s -> 258.53s]  Here we go. In three, two,
[259.41s -> 260.57s]  one.
[260.57s -> 276.42s]  It's action time. Oh, it's action time. Yes. There's more. There's more. Oh, there's even more.
[276.94s -> 289.78s]  Can I just walk through here? Yeah, these guys, these guys, I'm a police officer to these guys. They have no idea.
[292.91s -> 294.51s]  Get out of my way.
[294.51s -> 296.83s]  Wow. No, those are cops. Those are cops. Those are cops. Those are cops.
[297.47s -> 305.67s]  Evade the police? This guy's like flushing. What? This guy's flooding the bathroom. Dear Lord, give me the knife.
[306.39s -> 320.08s]  Thank you very much. I'll take that. It's the police. I can't remain undetected for long. The elevator is my exit point.
[320.36s -> 325.27s]  All right, let's go.
[325.31s -> 332.93s]  Keep low and keep quiet. This is ridiculous. I'm in like plants. I'm in like marijuana leaves.
[339.36s -> 342.87s]  Shit.
[342.87s -> 348.31s]  These guys are getting arrested over there.
[348.95s -> 360.50s]  Don't do drugs. Once this guy moves. I got a chance. There we go. Let's keep moving.
[361.02s -> 366.56s]  Let's keep moving. That's a bad place to be.
[367.28s -> 370.29s]  Where am I?
[371.37s -> 375.01s]  No, sit down. Sit down. What are you doing? What am I doing?
[375.45s -> 386.96s]  What'd I stand up for? My guy is like stood up. Hey, it worked. All right, whatever. That's good. Okay.
[387.56s -> 389.97s]  Fields of joy.
[389.97s -> 392.13s]  Activate checkpoint. I absolutely will.
[393.61s -> 397.69s]  Activate checkpoint. Hell freaking yeah. All right. Can I go out the window?
[397.69s -> 406.97s]  I don't think so. Anything in here. Point of interest. Anything I can do. This is gonna cause a fire, bro.
[407.33s -> 422.29s]  Two cops in here. They are currently busy. It seems like. No. I might have to try a different route.
[422.29s -> 428.90s]  I might have to try a different route. Or I could be able to sneak by them, but I have to walk right by them.
[428.90s -> 435.43s]  I don't know if that's gonna work. No, I don't think it is.
[436.47s -> 438.47s]  Holy crap.
[439.32s -> 443.92s]  Yeah, you know what? I'm gonna I'm gonna walk by these two. I'm gonna try and just be like I'm an officer.
[443.92s -> 446.53s]  See you later. Here we go.
[447.01s -> 452.62s]  Maybe not.
[457.58s -> 461.98s]  Anything else? Anything else?
[461.98s -> 469.29s]  Nope. I'm just gonna keep following these guys. I'm gonna follow these cops. They're making their way out.
[469.77s -> 473.16s]  Hopefully those beads don't make a whole lot of noise.
[473.80s -> 485.66s]  There is my exit point. Get me the hell out of here. Oh, I should be careful.
[485.66s -> 489.98s]  This is a bad idea just walking straight over here, but you know what? I don't really have another option.
[489.98s -> 495.81s]  Oh, this room is full of people.
[498.61s -> 500.61s]  Distraction.
[501.41s -> 511.37s]  In this room. Oh crap.
[515.99s -> 525.06s]  I don't want to kill this guy. No, it's not somebody you know. Just go back to your business.
[528.92s -> 540.86s]  What's what distraction do I need? I really don't want to like push. I'm gonna have to like drown this dude, aren't I?
[540.86s -> 554.93s]  Oh boy. Wait, why did he die from that? What the hell is this stuff? Is this like acid?
[555.01s -> 563.97s]  Why did he just die from that? Whatever. Not that way.
[563.97s -> 575.29s]  What kind of weirdo has like all these messed up bathtubs? Prices. Half hour $15, regular $20. Mud bath.
[575.67s -> 581.94s]  Hey, I don't want to alarm you or anything dude, but your mud bath kills people instantly when they touch it.
[581.94s -> 588.78s]  Just wanted to throw that out there for you. In case you weren't aware. There's a point of interest back here.
[588.86s -> 602.55s]  Put the knife away. Here's a bottle. I will absolutely take the bottle. Gonna have to throw that. Guaranteed.
[602.63s -> 609.10s]  This situation requires a distraction. Damn it.
[609.50s -> 613.89s]  Hmm.
[613.89s -> 627.63s]  This son of a bitch just hanging out in there. I got to get rid of that guy. These guys aren't paying that much attention.
[630.14s -> 634.16s]  Probably just sneak behind him. Evidence. Give me the evidence.
[639.03s -> 645.66s]  Maybe not. Maybe not, guys. I think I might have to just... No, no. What are you doing?
[646.26s -> 655.22s]  Alright, that's fine. You're good. Who is this guy in this room? This guy just might... I'm just freaking me out.
[655.78s -> 666.97s]  Damn it. I have an idea. This is... this is crazy, and I'm probably going to...
[668.72s -> 673.64s]  Probably going to regret doing this, but this is really the only thing I can think of, and we're going to try it right now. Here we go.
[679.68s -> 689.86s]  Okay. That should have distracted at least one of these guys. Let me in this room. Let me in this room. Let me in this room.
[690.54s -> 700.64s]  Point of interest in here. Anything? There is a... a bong.
[701.64s -> 709.84s]  Alright. Insert tape into the tape recorder. This will surely compromise with my position. Okay. I know what I got to do.
[709.84s -> 718.18s]  I know what I got to do. I've got to put a tape in here, and then see where the hell they come from.
[718.74s -> 726.07s]  Nice dance music. Here they come. Here they come. They're all coming in from this way.
[726.07s -> 736.52s]  Oh boy, I just... I just screwed myself over right here. I just completely screwed myself right here.
[736.72s -> 745.57s]  This... this asshole would get out of the freaking way over here. I want to just throw a knife at this guy's head.
[745.73s -> 756.26s]  I'm like holding a bong. It's time to go. It's time to just walk straight out. Get out of the way.
[756.26s -> 761.26s]  Oh, get out of the way, you piece of crap. Move out of the way! Move out of the way!
[761.66s -> 764.90s]  Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
[765.34s -> 778.32s]  Get in the elevator. Get in the elevator. Oh crap. That's bad. That's real bad. That's real bad. That's real bad.
[778.32s -> 785.08s]  Oh, can I go this way? Come on. I got to find a hiding place right now. Right now.
[785.08s -> 792.36s]  Oh, get me in the tub. Get me one of the damn tubs. I need to get in like in a tub.
[792.36s -> 802.52s]  I can hide in there. Let me hide in this tub. The one that I killed the dude, and I don't care.
[802.52s -> 810.62s]  I'll hide in the tub. You think it bothers me? What's going on with that guy?
[810.62s -> 828.23s]  Is that guy dead? Man. Damn it. Give me the screwdriver. Now I need a new disguise. This is bad.
[828.23s -> 836.22s]  If that guy wasn't just in the goddamn way, this would have been over by now. Piece of crap.
[836.22s -> 844.54s]  Good. Maybe you'll come hunting for me, and I'll be able to just sneak around. Son of a bitch.
[844.54s -> 860.79s]  Wow. Get me out of this room. There should be nobody at this door now. Oh, thank heavens. Thank heavens.
[860.79s -> 869.02s]  What? You gotta be kidding me. Oh, no. Oh, you know what? I'm so sick and tired of this.
[869.02s -> 878.68s]  Get out of my face. No ammo? That was the end right there. You gotta be kidding me.
[878.68s -> 883.64s]  Oh, I'm so pissed off right now. Oh. Alright, I made it back here.
[887.05s -> 890.97s]  I got minus 1,400 though on the way somehow. I don't know how the hell that happened.
[893.16s -> 902.20s]  So I'm gonna make sure I kill this guy. I am going to murder the guy that's in this room right now.
[902.20s -> 906.52s]  Do I have a horrible way for him to die? Whoa, speaking of dying, there's a guy coming my way
[906.52s -> 911.77s]  right now. And a guy coming the other way, I think. Damn. Just walk right by me, dude.
[911.77s -> 919.50s]  Don't worry about a thing. Just keep going. You don't see anything. Go. Alright. I'm gonna
[919.50s -> 926.18s]  think of the worst way to kill this guy because he ruined my good game over here. Alright, I'm going
[926.18s -> 935.61s]  in. Alright, where is this guy? Hey, you know what? You are dead. I don't even care. This guy
[935.61s -> 943.69s]  ruined everything. Get over here. I don't care if I get minus 50 million points. You ruined
[943.69s -> 948.57s]  everything, you son of a bitch. I should just shoot you in the face too. Alright, let's keep
[948.57s -> 954.04s]  going. Now I'm gonna play the music and the cops are gonna come out. I had a really good score
[954.04s -> 960.02s]  going too, I think. Let's go. Come on in, boys. Let me finish this.
[960.02s -> 979.59s]  I'm sure they're coming in. Only two? Where's the other ones? Alright. Now start arguing.
[979.59s -> 990.60s]  Let's go. That's all it took. I just had to, like, kill the dude. Here we go. Call the elevator.
[990.60s -> 998.58s]  Beautiful. And that's gonna wrap up the video, guys. The episode. Thank you all so much for
[998.58s -> 1002.90s]  watching. I really do appreciate it. And I'll see you guys in the next episode trying to evade the
[1002.90s -> 1009.30s]  police even more. And let me know in the comment section, guys, if you want to see this series
[1009.30s -> 1016.02s]  continue in its current form or if you would rather see something like crazy mission parts or juicy
[1016.02s -> 1019.94s]  rage moments or something like that. Funny little highlight clips of this game because I'm willing
[1019.94s -> 1025.06s]  to do both. But just let me know. I might do both. I might try a change a little bit up a little bit
[1025.06s -> 1028.58s]  here in the next couple episodes. We will see. But thank you so much for watching. I really do
[1028.58s -> 1031.94s]  appreciate it again, guys. And I'll see y'all soon. Take care, everybody.
