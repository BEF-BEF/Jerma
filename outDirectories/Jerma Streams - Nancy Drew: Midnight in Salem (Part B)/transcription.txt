[0.57s -> 14.71s]  Hello? Hello? Can anyone hear me talking? What the fuck is going on? Well, I think I need to
[14.71s -> 27.59s]  refresh. It says my stream is live, but I can't see anybody typing. Let me see if this works.
[32.55s -> 44.47s]  I think I'm live. Yeah, okay, now I can see. That was weird. All right, so anyways,
[44.47s -> 54.02s]  back to Nancy Drew and the Salem mystery. But I need to pop this out. Hold on,
[54.42s -> 68.76s]  this one died over here. Shit. How do I get this to refresh? Refresh, please. Oh, no. Okay,
[68.76s -> 86.50s]  I'm gonna have to pop you out over here. He doesn't know. Is it off again? All right, I think.
[87.14s -> 104.49s]  Why can't I open the chat? I can't even open like my Twitch chat room. No. All right, I can see you
[104.49s -> 116.94s]  over here, but you're in a really bad spot. All right, I can see you over here. All right, here we
[116.94s -> 129.02s]  go. But how will they hear all about... I stream dead. I can see. I can see. Yeah, when it died,
[129.02s -> 137.93s]  I lost connection to like stream labs and then it killed everything. Anyways, hi. That was... I
[137.93s -> 146.30s]  get... whatever. I don't know what my brain was doing. I just hovered over run 60 second ad break.
[146.30s -> 159.35s]  Like, I was gonna run an ad? That would be horrendous. All right, here we go. My grandpa,
[159.35s -> 176.66s]  right? Grandpa. Oh, 120 second ad. Dude, that's the second time that the stream has just turned
[176.66s -> 184.66s]  off and then come right back totally normally, completely fine. I probably would rather just
[184.66s -> 190.04s]  have that than horrible issues all day. All right, where's this... where's this... what's this thing?
[190.04s -> 198.33s]  What is this? It's a U. All right, I need to find a U. Ceiling? Is something on the ceiling?
[198.33s -> 215.32s]  Can I move it? This is master difficulty. Can I leave the room? I can't even leave the room.
[217.29s -> 224.31s]  No, you're not getting any ads. Stream went down and I'm not coming back with an ad after that.
[241.88s -> 259.08s]  I don't care. I know that's like the whole point of the game, but I just... where's the U?
[259.08s -> 275.13s]  Am I missing something over here? Under the button? I need a U key. Here's the thing,
[275.13s -> 283.46s]  though. I know you guys don't know where it is either, so I don't feel bad because I know
[283.54s -> 294.94s]  you don't know. I swear to god, if you slide the bookcase over into the key under there,
[299.22s -> 311.11s]  we don't know. I know. What about this? Just spam tab, go over interactive menus.
[313.02s -> 316.06s]  It's not anything to do with like the candle thing. It has to.
[328.57s -> 347.37s]  The books. It's in the books. The books. It's in the books. The window.
[353.48s -> 355.72s]  I don't... going to amateur wouldn't even change anything.
[356.84s -> 364.04s]  Is it like all the way in the back with the spot where you cut it out and put hide a key?
[365.32s -> 373.35s]  Leave the room. I don't think I can... Can I leave this room? Can I leave? How long have I known my
[373.35s -> 389.54s]  dad? Dr. Hearst, how long have I known my dad for? Well, wait. I'm just trapped in the room.
[390.98s -> 413.50s]  There's nothing I can do. Is there a... find the key? They're really, they're really, they're really,
[413.50s -> 420.50s]  they're really... Wait, wait, wait. It's about hiding something. Give earth to my prayer,
[421.06s -> 426.18s]  give ear to my prayer, oh god, and hide not yourself from my plea for mercy. Give ear to
[426.18s -> 431.38s]  my prayer, oh god, and hide not yourself from my plea for mercy. Give ear to my prayer, oh god,
[432.10s -> 438.84s]  god. I feel like this is me streaming. Just replace the stuff between oh god with
[439.48s -> 447.13s]  what's happening on the video game. All right, so hide and hide not yourself from my plea for
[447.13s -> 455.27s]  mercy. So it's hidden in a book somewhere. It's hidden in a book. It's what we know. What's that?
[455.91s -> 470.89s]  What's that? What is that? Touch it. Why would I be able to zoom in on this? Move this. What is
[470.89s -> 481.19s]  this thing? Click it. What about on the side of the table? Wait a minute. Other side? It's
[481.19s -> 499.06s]  one over here too. Hold right mouse button to rotate the item. Click on the item to interact.
[500.02s -> 505.78s]  What the fuck? I did it. Okay, it's one of those games. I didn't think it was one of those games,
[505.78s -> 517.35s]  and it is. What's in here? Yeah, get fucked. You're gonna get to my porn stash.
[519.67s -> 532.71s]  Let's see you in this maze. You fucking idiot. You'll never get my porn. Oh shit, that was
[532.71s -> 540.39s]  wicked easy, but not this one. This one's even harder. This has pawns in there. You'll never
[540.39s -> 550.26s]  fucking get in there. I found it. It's here. What? Amazing. Locked behind some sort of cage though.
[550.26s -> 560.68s]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. AW root beer. It's a password. Oh shit, I shouldn't have shown you that. The
[560.68s -> 573.06s]  ghost fucking flies through. Hey, Jerma sucks. Thanks for the 15 subs. I missed the first one,
[573.06s -> 578.55s]  but thank you for the 10 community subs right here. Thank you. Thank you for the
[578.55s -> 581.51s]  huge amount of subs, Jerma sucks. Take it back to the shop.
[585.19s -> 592.57s]  No. All right, so let's get it. How do I pick it up? It's locked with a leather belt.
[596.02s -> 603.54s]  How do I grab it? Is it on fire? Is it burning? Is it too hot? Oh, I can leave.
[614.23s -> 615.03s]  Incoming call.
[623.58s -> 624.14s]  Can I hang up?
[630.62s -> 637.46s]  Deirdre, Deirdre, there's a tornado. I can't talk to you. My porn!
[638.02s -> 638.66s]  What are you?
[643.78s -> 654.71s]  They took the book. This is the only way out besides the door. The thief must still be
[654.71s -> 664.31s]  close. Let's talk about it. Quick, hurry. Imagine having to run fast and you just move forward
[666.15s -> 675.74s]  two feet. I'm running. That person was running like an animal. They had their hands down,
[675.74s -> 684.20s]  like running on all fours. Is it a werewolf? Nancy, you can't do that. That'll hurt. Quick, run.
[690.86s -> 696.22s]  Someone's pushing me from behind. No, I don't want to do it. Quick fucking sprint.
[703.93s -> 704.41s]  Just do it here.
[713.77s -> 727.56s]  That's such an old... It was... I can't even tell you. The fucking smoke grenade.
[728.68s -> 735.22s]  I'm gone now. Magic acting. They did it twice. That's fucking awesome.
[735.94s -> 739.70s]  Gotta figure out which way they went. Must be a clue here.
[740.98s -> 746.02s]  I dropped my key. I dropped my address and I dropped my can that I was eating out of.
[746.02s -> 751.54s]  Scan my DNA, bitch. This canister looks to have been used as a home. You'll find me.
[755.91s -> 767.37s]  Oh no, I dropped my first class ticket. I'm going to Boston. By the way, I saw this movie in 3D.
[768.09s -> 783.11s]  All right, first class flight, October 28th. Flight in, 0898. Okay, seat place 3D boarding time,
[783.11s -> 789.78s]  1540. All right, what about on the back? Global travel airways. We're going to have to give them
[789.78s -> 799.85s]  a call. Here, look. The A&W root beer key. And it's got a weird pattern on it. We might have to
[799.85s -> 806.39s]  put that in a weird pattern. Wouldn't you want your locked box to have the very basic standard
[806.39s -> 818.18s]  key? Because I know that this key goes to that. A&W. Same as the desk. This canister looks to
[818.18s -> 825.61s]  have been used as a homemade smoke bomb. What? How do you make a homemade...
[826.57s -> 839.91s]  It's like Chef Boyardee and battery acid? I don't understand. Can smoke bomb? Okay. Well, I got it.
[841.03s -> 848.58s]  Oh my god. Don't hang up on me. Yes, Deidre. What is it? You know where I am right now? Salem.
[849.30s -> 859.61s]  Salem? As in which trial, Salem? Avi. Chug what's left. My cousin had gotten into some trouble here
[859.61s -> 866.25s]  and I thought I could help her out. But it turns out that the situation is much more complicated
[866.25s -> 876.17s]  than I anticipated. So now I'm calling you to ask for some guidance. You want my help? Yes. Yes.
[876.17s -> 884.57s]  Don't make this more painful. I could use your professional opinion, okay? Well, it so happens
[884.57s -> 891.13s]  that the case I'm on is connected to Boston, which is just nearby Salem, and I was never a big
[891.13s -> 898.41s]  believer in coincidences. Oh. I have a good blurry eyesight. I'd love to. I'm not a great detective.
[898.41s -> 902.25s]  You don't have to wear glasses. I thought I had reached a dead end, but it looks like I have to go
[902.25s -> 908.25s]  to Massachusetts anyway. In any case, a fresh perspective would do me good. Oh, you're already
[908.25s -> 916.33s]  annoying me and you're not even here yet. You're welcome. I get the feel she's focusing on the can.
[917.21s -> 921.77s]  If I look over here, my eyes are ripped down, still focused on the can.
[923.13s -> 930.42s]  That would hurt. Automatic long letter grid if I could drive this.
[931.62s -> 937.14s]  I appreciate you coming here, Drew. I'm just glad you didn't change your mind and leave me
[937.14s -> 944.01s]  at the airport. I'd have crossed my mind. Keep the excessive cheeriness under control
[944.73s -> 950.57s]  and we'll be fine. Hey, eyes on the road. No promises. Where were you, by the way? Eyes on the road.
[950.57s -> 957.05s]  Did I interrupt a vacation with Ned? Didn't you bring me here to help with a case?
[957.93s -> 960.25s]  Yes, I did. And that's it.
[966.23s -> 967.19s]  Grabbed the shift.
[971.75s -> 976.41s]  The house wasn't completely destroyed, but the person who lived there had to move out.
[977.21s -> 980.97s]  Oh, you drive a stick. This is my case. I know you're a...
[980.97s -> 986.49s]  Why am I leaning the other way? I'm like sitting down and looking up. Where am I?
[987.21s -> 988.25s]  Why was I down there?
[996.73s -> 1000.25s]  Is this the car ride? I'm going to tell you how it is car ride.
[1017.37s -> 1020.65s]  What's that? What's that say?
[1023.53s -> 1026.25s]  What is that? Is that an ejector?
[1033.82s -> 1036.38s]  I can't see where your mouse is. Oh, it's that problem again.
[1038.94s -> 1042.46s]  I can't see where my fucking mouse is. God damn it.
[1043.42s -> 1049.35s]  All right. Where's my mouse? No, no, no. This, this thing over here before it gets cut off.
[1050.15s -> 1055.32s]  The thing that looked all the way to the right. Looks like an ejector seat thing. The lever.
[1055.32s -> 1068.07s]  All right. Let me fix this. How did I fix this last time? How did I fix this last?
[1068.07s -> 1082.36s]  I think the stream crashing broke this. I think I just broke it. It was like that before too.
[1083.24s -> 1105.42s]  Is that going to work? I broke it. All right. Capture the screen.
[1106.38s -> 1113.05s]  Why is it scaling? Oh, I hate this program with a passion. This is it. This is it.
[1113.05s -> 1117.93s]  This is the stream where I don't use Streamlabs OBS ever again. This is it. This is the one.
[1117.93s -> 1128.47s]  Okay. Not using it ever again. All right. So you get to capture the fucking screen. What are you
[1128.47s -> 1145.14s]  doing? That's not even right. It's incorrect. What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck are you
[1145.30s -> 1176.07s]  doing? I made it worse. No, I didn't. Clipping. Where? Professional streamer. No, professional
[1176.07s -> 1193.83s]  streamer using shit software is what happens. All right. Let's go. Why don't we start with your
[1193.83s -> 1205.90s]  extended family? They're cousins. The Perry's. P-A-R-R-Y. Oh, like in fencing. Yes. Tegan is the
[1205.90s -> 1212.14s]  older one. May is younger. They've, they had a difficult time. Dude, if I could keep my stream
[1212.14s -> 1217.50s]  turned on, I would uninstall this on Streamlabs OBS just regularly again. On the most important
[1217.50s -> 1227.83s]  historic mansion in Salem. And I know it's not true. I know it. We haven't taken a single turn,
[1227.83s -> 1236.62s]  by the way. This is, wherever we're going is in a straight line. This is it. All right. We've
[1236.62s -> 1243.51s]  never even taken one turn. What can you tell me about May? She has a reputation as a troublemaker.
[1243.51s -> 1249.75s]  I feel like I'm sitting in a studio of being manipulated. This is being keyed in. We haven't
[1249.75s -> 1255.75s]  moved. Sometimes she can even sense things before they happen. Odd how? I don't know. Troubled dean
[1255.75s -> 1263.70s]  stuff. Difficult time as a kid. Oddest thing is she won't give an alibi. That's what we do.
[1264.26s -> 1272.26s]  Suspicious. That's the problem. Everyone is so suspicious of her. How is this the stream that
[1272.26s -> 1278.02s]  you stop using Streamlabs if the stream isn't canon? Sounds like we should talk to her soon.
[1278.02s -> 1288.14s]  Where do you think we're going? What does Tegan think about this? She's worried about May,
[1288.14s -> 1295.74s]  obviously. Tegan isn't like May. She's upstanding. She works at the Salem Museum and doesn't know a
[1295.74s -> 1304.47s]  thing about criminal cases, which is why she contacted me. Is there like I don't have any
[1304.47s -> 1309.11s]  more questions? I don't I don't have one more question. I don't want I don't have any more
[1309.11s -> 1316.07s]  questions. The Hathorn house and it's old. Like really old. And now it's been set on fire.
[1316.87s -> 1322.55s]  Nothing else significant about it? Well, yeah. That's kind of why you're here, which is why.
[1323.19s -> 1332.52s]  All right, we got it. Here's the house. The Perry house.
[1335.75s -> 1343.88s]  What do you mean haunted? Get out of the car, Nancy. Exactly that. There's ghosts. Deirdre.
[1343.88s -> 1350.68s]  I don't believe it either, Drew. But I can't explain it. Everyone seems to think they exist.
[1351.56s -> 1357.72s]  With so many sightings, even if it isn't real ghosts, something is definitely going on. I
[1357.80s -> 1365.00s]  thought that maybe you can disprove them. So would you please get out of my car and come inside?
[1372.30s -> 1379.18s]  This looks like a house that's currently occupied. Side by side. You'd better learn to keep up with
[1379.18s -> 1391.11s]  me. You must be Nancy. Thank you so much for coming. Am I is this like a do I like investigate
[1391.11s -> 1394.31s]  ghosts? You know, you live in the same neighborhood for 20 years and you'd expect your neighbors to
[1394.31s -> 1398.55s]  be a little more understanding when your family is false. Did Nancy Drew do this before the
[1398.55s -> 1407.35s]  conjuring? Oh, I'm sorry. How are you, Deirdre? I'm good. Thanks. Tegan Perry. Welcome to my home.
[1407.35s -> 1412.87s]  Welcome. Hi. Although right now, my parents are literally on safari in Namibia. So while their
[1412.87s -> 1416.95s]  daughter is being convicted of a crime she didn't commit, I'm taking care of things around here.
[1417.59s -> 1423.83s]  They'll be home soon. We're a very expensive courier is tracking them down in the bush.
[1423.83s -> 1428.23s]  Top notch. I found him on the internet. Deirdre tells me you'll be assisting her in clearing my
[1428.23s -> 1436.07s]  sister's name. Assisting? Yeah. She's innocent. I don't know why she won't help herself. She's got
[1437.94s -> 1444.10s]  difficult reputation. Well, you know, Deirdre, what people here can be like. She doesn't trust
[1444.10s -> 1449.22s]  easily. I'm sorry. Are you hungry? There's clam chowder. Homemade. Oh, clam chowder? I
[1449.22s -> 1452.26s]  wear a fucking new wiggler and I'm fucking blotted. I remember blotting a new wiggler.
[1452.26s -> 1457.54s]  Deirdre, sorry. You're bunking with me. Oh, I almost forgot. After you girls get comfortable,
[1457.54s -> 1461.78s]  you two should swing by the museum. Might as well take in some history while you're here, right?
[1462.82s -> 1469.30s]  Just don't get suckered into that witch's walking tour. Olivia Ravencroft is not a witch. She would
[1469.30s -> 1473.78s]  have you believing all kinds of nonsense about the town being full of goats. I thought you two
[1473.78s -> 1478.66s]  used to be friends. That was a long time ago. Look, I'm sorry. I gotta get going. I'm running
[1478.66s -> 1483.22s]  late to an appointment. That's the villain. Thanks, Tegan. I appreciate you. That's the villain
[1483.22s -> 1488.58s]  with the smoke. Before you go, do you have time for a quick question? Nancy, we just got here.
[1488.58s -> 1493.14s]  That's the only thing you eat in Boston. Sorry. I know you're in a rush. It would really help.
[1493.14s -> 1499.51s]  Of course. I have time for one question. If it'll help. What can you tell me where the fire
[1499.51s -> 1507.61s]  happened? Do you mind introducing me to May? What can you tell me about the fire?
[1508.41s -> 1513.29s]  What have you heard about it? Look, I appreciate you want the quickest way to know that you are
[1513.29s -> 1518.01s]  responsible. What about that fire? What do you know about the fire? What do you know about that?
[1518.81s -> 1525.29s]  That's not what Nancy is asking about. I'm sorry if I wasn't clear. I just thought since
[1525.29s -> 1531.61s]  the Hawthorne house is important to the town, you must know about it. Oh, I'm so sorry. Yes,
[1531.61s -> 1536.57s]  John Hawthorne was one of Salem's founders. His large house estate was the oldest surviving
[1536.57s -> 1541.85s]  structure from Salem. Oh, is that all? Ah, ah, ah. That was two questions. I said one.
[1544.01s -> 1549.45s]  But yes, it was also the big time judge that presided over the Salem witch trial. Is there
[1549.45s -> 1556.73s]  some other fire I need to know about? No. May's accident was in a fire. I just don't want her
[1556.73s -> 1563.21s]  getting upset with unnecessary questions about things long over. I understand. You can read all
[1563.21s -> 1573.58s]  about Judge Hawthorne and you come to the museum later. All right, so turn on faucet. First thing
[1573.58s -> 1577.98s]  I'm going to try. You jerk. Tegan said you've been in town for days, but you haven't come by.
[1579.16s -> 1584.14s]  I know. I know. I had to check in with your case at the uh. I feel like I'm watching somebody that
[1584.14s -> 1589.26s]  made it in the cinema. I didn't want to bother you. How are you holding up? And it was not,
[1589.26s -> 1592.70s]  it was like an experiment that we're going to try to see if they get a camera in the house.
[1593.34s -> 1596.74s]  Hey, at least I got you to get off your butt and finally visit me.
[1598.86s -> 1610.58s]  Oh, this is the girl I was telling you about. Nancy Drew. Nice to meet you. Okay, well see you
[1610.58s -> 1614.66s]  later. She really doesn't want to talk. This could be difficult. That wasn't even that. No,
[1614.66s -> 1618.90s]  no, no. That was not being ignored. That was I didn't see you. I'll be in the kitchen. You're
[1618.90s -> 1629.11s]  not in the house. All right, let's go through their drawers and stuff.
[1631.22s -> 1637.99s]  Green power. Oil. You keep all your oils and shit up on the wind direct sunlight.
[1642.33s -> 1652.22s]  That's new. Don't do that. All right, stove. Open the stove. Go to the fridge. Huh? Candle.
[1653.43s -> 1661.64s]  Just a gross candle on the counter. Huh? An evil candle on the counter. Cool.
[1662.28s -> 1670.81s]  With matches with your nice flowers and nothing there. The kitchen table has a great view out
[1670.81s -> 1679.75s]  into the neighborhood. Eat the candle. You know I would. If I could, you know I would. Key like
[1679.75s -> 1698.36s]  hidden in shoe. Uh, no wait down here. Deirdre would be upset if I left without her. Can I just
[1698.36s -> 1708.17s]  turn on the lights? Okay, hold on. Should I introduce myself? Whoa, you got right in there.
[1708.97s -> 1716.65s]  The way that I'm moving, I'm the ghost. All right, can't spray. Rust be gone. Now that's handy.
[1717.29s -> 1721.69s]  Never know when a bit of stubborn iron oxide will get in the way of investigating.
[1721.69s -> 1731.35s]  Take it. All right, so what is it? Rust be gone. Use rust be gone. I got rust be gone. What's this?
[1731.35s -> 1738.01s]  Hiking the Patagonian Highland. Yeah, that's good. Remember that symbol if I'm needed later.
[1740.15s -> 1750.94s]  Oh found it. What did I find? An egg? I didn't know I was on it. Is this how they like keep me
[1750.94s -> 1759.58s]  occupied? You know Nancy's coming over so just just hide a few eggs and she'll eventually find
[1759.58s -> 1764.14s]  them and we can just you know we just tell her like oh good job you did it. I don't understand.
[1764.46s -> 1777.30s]  I found it. Deirdre's convertible. Looks strikingly familiar. Talk to the picture?
[1781.42s -> 1788.95s]  All right, let's talk. Nice to meet you. Yeah. Uh can I look around the house? Do you mind if I
[1788.95s -> 1809.67s]  look around the house? Oh you're so weird. I'm done talking, okay? Uh okay um real photos of actual
[1809.67s -> 1819.96s]  people. I always find these interesting because what who are these people? They're like devs or
[1819.96s -> 1828.44s]  like cousins of devs or nephews or friends or brothers sisters children and it's always like
[1828.44s -> 1841.72s]  it's interesting. They're random people. Now that would be weird. Are there stock photos of like
[1841.72s -> 1845.88s]  we're a family like just in the backyard? Is there? I guess there has to be right?
[1846.76s -> 1859.00s]  The neighborhood looks peaceful from up here. There are a lot of them. All right I got rust be
[1859.00s -> 1866.94s]  gone. Can I spray rust in the bed? A good night's rest improves memory retention but it's too early
[1866.94s -> 1876.70s]  for bed. I got a drawer right here. A good night's rest. Oh you're gonna note. What's that? Found
[1876.70s -> 1889.82s]  Teagan's photo. What does it look like? Coven. What does this mean?
[1893.10s -> 1898.46s]  What? You're gonna leave that just in the a Polaroid of this?
[1905.67s -> 1916.30s]  Hey here's a Polaroid of me posing. I'm a witch with scary candles. Keep out.
[1916.38s -> 1930.50s]  Does that say wham? New England riot. Keep out. I was here. The Grim Reaper. Do not enter. Wham.
[1934.78s -> 1945.37s]  No parents allowed. Okay well I have photo now. Let's uh let's go talk shit.
[1946.25s -> 1953.91s]  How do I talk shit? What's my persuadability at right now? There's another room. Can I go down
[1953.91s -> 1963.74s]  this like hall? Go down here. All right I have rust spray. I have a photo. Here look I got a photo.
[1964.70s -> 1976.47s]  Look at this. Are you ready to leave yet? We don't have all day. Uh what were you actually doing?
[1977.59s -> 1983.51s]  This tour sounds interesting. Don't tell Teagan that's your plan. It'll give us a good overview
[1983.51s -> 1990.63s]  of the town. You mean I want to meet the real witch of Salem? Yeah I do. She might know something.
[1991.43s -> 1996.47s]  I wonder why Teagan doesn't like her. You don't have to investigate everything. Rust spray her
[1996.47s -> 2002.23s]  in the face. Olivia steals Teagan's visitors sounds like. You really want to do the dumb tour?
[2002.87s -> 2008.95s]  You don't have to come with me. Side by side. How long this game is? It does sound more fun in the
[2008.95s -> 2015.64s]  museum. All right how do I just leave the conversation? Why do I have to do every dialogue option? What were
[2015.64s -> 2021.00s]  you actually doing before you picked me up from the airport? You gave May a non-answer when she
[2021.00s -> 2025.64s]  asked why it took you so long? Because they're all working together. A non-answer? Yeah. You were at
[2025.64s -> 2034.68s]  your witch meeting. And I'm so oblivious that you could all be witches around me. I was May's
[2034.68s -> 2039.48s]  cousin. They started. And I'm busy looking around for weirdly shaped fucking keys. They think she
[2039.48s -> 2047.48s]  did it. Everyone does. So I went to check out the Hathorn house myself but I never went inside.
[2048.28s -> 2055.48s]  The ghost? What? No. There was some weirdo there who told me the ghost was going to
[2055.48s -> 2060.04s]  steal my soul. Looking for eggs. It was totally creepy. Yeah. And then I found out that everyone
[2060.04s -> 2066.92s]  in this town believes in ghosts so I. They're doing like a demonic seance behind me. I'm looking
[2066.92s -> 2072.52s]  around finding interestingly painted eggs. Did the police give you anything? Anything at all?
[2072.52s -> 2076.52s]  They told me there's a Judge Danforth in town and he's going over the particulars
[2076.52s -> 2082.60s]  of the Hathorn house estate. I found. I know him. Not well. All right. Are we going into town or
[2082.60s -> 2088.52s]  what? Yeah let's go. Sure. Who could gain something by burning down a house? Somebody. Insurance claim
[2088.52s -> 2095.48s]  maybe? Maybe. Possibly. See if anyone checks off those boxes. It's usually. All right let's go.
[2096.52s -> 2113.50s]  What do you think about this? What do you think about this? Nothing. Talk to Tegan in the museum.
[2113.50s -> 2127.22s]  Talk to Judge Danforth. Who's Ned? It's the voicemail inbox of Ned Nickerson.
[2127.22s -> 2131.54s]  I apologize that I did not come to the phone in a timely fashion. Please feel free to leave a
[2131.54s -> 2142.82s]  message after the beep. And then I'm gonna really piss that person off because they have a new
[2142.82s -> 2154.06s]  voicemail now. And it's gonna be nothing there. All right. Hi you've reached the phone of private
[2154.06s -> 2159.58s]  investigator Deirdre Shannon. I'm working on an important case and. It's a fucking android.
[2159.58s -> 2163.82s]  It's an android. Information you'd like to share. Please leave a message after the beep.
[2164.70s -> 2174.49s]  Professional. Deirdre is taking this very seriously. That's scary. That's actually really scary.
[2175.13s -> 2198.14s]  Do I have photos? Oh you can take photos in this game. Can I take a selfie? What else can I do?
[2206.63s -> 2214.97s]  Love you too. Can I write? Hey Nancy is the manager of the phone. My old acquaintance in Salem.
[2215.85s -> 2229.46s]  We're into DMs now. Everything's great. Miss you. Miss you too, Nance. We'll have to catch up more
[2229.46s -> 2234.10s]  later. The bus is here. Okay talk soon. I swear I would have. We would have loved this place. We should
[2234.10s -> 2238.02s]  go here together sometime. That was robbery in the book I was looking for got stolen. What are
[2238.02s -> 2244.01s]  you okay? Yes I'm fine. I'm seeing this through. There is something going on and I have to figure
[2244.01s -> 2247.93s]  out what. Okay just let me know if there's anything I can do. I will. Love you. Love you too.
[2249.13s -> 2265.13s]  How do I put my phone down? All right let's go. Out. I just called you. Hi Nance how've you been?
[2265.13s -> 2270.33s]  Thanks for finally picking up. Well not good apparently. My pupils are fucking completely
[2270.33s -> 2276.41s]  dilated. You know you should really enjoy yourself more Nance. Life's too short to be working all the
[2276.41s -> 2283.29s]  time. This doesn't work for me. It's fun. Besides crime doesn't take a vacation. Speaking of which
[2283.29s -> 2293.08s]  how's yours? Yeah one second. Sounds like you are having fun. Uh you know standard fare. Nothing too
[2293.08s -> 2302.52s]  crazy. I miss you Nance. I miss you. Hey give it back. Nancey I'll call you later. What is going on?
[2304.74s -> 2320.81s]  Is that are we together? Is that my boyfriend? That's my boyfriend. So I'm gonna look for wait
[2320.81s -> 2334.15s]  look in the mailbox. Jesus Christ don't. Don't sneak up on me like that. Hi you've reached the
[2334.15s -> 2339.75s]  phone of private investigator Deirdre Shannon. I'm working on an important case and can't come to
[2339.75s -> 2344.23s]  the phone right now but if you have any information you'd like to share please leave a message.
[2344.95s -> 2353.67s]  Professional Deirdre is taking this very seriously. I don't want to call again. I wish I could text.
[2354.47s -> 2373.10s]  All right put the phone down. What about that car? It's a broken window. No it's not. All right let's go.
[2373.26s -> 2382.68s]  Let's go. Her eyes have madness to them. It's Google street view.
[2400.39s -> 2402.23s]  I've been here is exactly what it looks like.
[2411.93s -> 2418.25s]  Oh this should be interesting. The world would have you believe witches were not real.
[2418.97s -> 2425.53s]  I'm not talking about old ugly women who curse their neighbors and fly on. What is this? What's
[2425.53s -> 2432.01s]  going with the protesters? Witches are real. What's going on? They have always been real.
[2432.65s -> 2438.57s]  They are alive and well. They are powerful. Which protesters? Carrying the secrets of the world
[2438.57s -> 2450.41s]  beyond the one we see. Ritual, mystery, magic. Most exist now. This is mocap actor of overacting.
[2450.41s -> 2460.60s]  You know what I mean? It is said that in Salem a coven of witches settled in recent years.
[2461.32s -> 2469.08s]  Set on revenge for the deaths of the Salem witches. Their ritual one midnight on Halloween
[2469.08s -> 2475.72s]  unleashed the angry spirits of the past. Is my mouth just open? Wait a minute that's you.
[2477.48s -> 2483.70s]  I feel like my mouth is open just like saliva is going down. Real history of the witches of Salem.
[2484.42s -> 2490.66s]  Same animation too. Some of my favorite locations in town and perhaps you too will see one of the
[2490.66s -> 2498.58s]  restless day. They've in Austria used the same kind of stage magic she's using. Thief? There was a
[2498.58s -> 2505.78s]  thief? What were you doing there? Visiting a spooky old castle. I don't know if it was worth
[2506.98s -> 2513.46s]  driving all the way from Boston. It's a long trip but I'm trying to make my friends happy.
[2525.54s -> 2536.25s]  I have here a photo of witchcraft in practice and all of you here are going to see the truth.
[2536.73s -> 2555.56s]  So here comes trouble. Me? Nothing too bad I hope. Did you know that in the Malleus Maleficarum
[2555.56s -> 2561.98s]  ginger hair was the sign of a witch? My kind of beef? I'm not nearly as talented as you are.
[2562.54s -> 2568.94s]  Oh that's not into it. You're making me blush. Oh there it is. Actually I think he thinks she's
[2568.94s -> 2575.50s]  talking to him. You truly are a witch. So to become a witch do I need to take a test or get a diploma?
[2576.30s -> 2582.22s]  A true witch is not made with pieces of paper. She is born to it and will feel
[2582.22s -> 2589.98s]  the call. A true witch. A true witch tries to study this. We don't need permission. We don't live by
[2589.98s -> 2596.94s]  the rules. Anyway what can I help you with? Now he's stuck in a situation that I think a lot of
[2596.94s -> 2604.92s]  us have been in previously before is if there's a conversation happening through you you can't
[2604.92s -> 2614.63s]  there's not much you can really do you could I guess step one step to the left but if this guy
[2614.63s -> 2619.43s]  turns and looks over here and realizes that he's not even remotely part of this conversation
[2619.43s -> 2628.02s]  then it's weird but if you know take out the phone hit a few buttons pretend to be on a phone call
[2628.02s -> 2631.86s]  with somebody that's how you get out of this otherwise you'd like this guy I don't think he
[2631.86s -> 2634.82s]  has his phone on he's stuck here he is stuck here until we're done having a conversation.
[2635.38s -> 2647.61s]  The bishop most nights it gets busier around Halloween and I'm sure you can figure out why
[2647.61s -> 2650.73s]  he's a blue tooth. How about the night that the Hathorn house was burned?
[2651.69s -> 2656.09s]  You look a little young to be working for the police. Don't I do puzzle games?
[2656.09s -> 2661.37s]  Oh no it's nothing like that we're just curious jurists. I pressed like my grandfather's
[2661.37s -> 2665.85s]  porn briefcase button because I've already spoken and we've talked about Salem and so
[2665.85s -> 2673.61s]  you were here. I was out of town. Did you girls know that Salem is haunted? There's a ghost here.
[2674.73s -> 2683.08s]  If you go on my tour you'll learn where you can find it. Get that candle. Okay um bye talk to you
[2683.08s -> 2690.14s]  later. Move me back. I want to I got a message. Hey Nancy Deidre gave me your number. Sorry but
[2690.14s -> 2695.66s]  before I was stressed. Don't worry about it and thanks for all right let me get the fuck out of
[2695.74s -> 2701.08s]  it. I take two steps to the right. They have the conversation up. Thanks for getting in contact.
[2701.08s -> 2706.78s]  Where did I find the museum? Oh you're so welcome to come by. We're on the opposite side of the town
[2706.78s -> 2717.30s]  square. We're on the opposite side of the town square from the courthouse. Just turn right and
[2717.30s -> 2727.62s]  go past the old cemetery. We can't miss it. Great. Fucking battery though come on. I want to find out.
[2728.42s -> 2735.24s]  You get the idea. Fire at Hathorn House. We all know certain renegades in this town know something
[2735.24s -> 2741.32s]  or two about fire. May Perry. You don't think she'd do it again do you? She was so young. Am I reading
[2741.32s -> 2747.08s]  their thoughts? Creeping around back alleys with her hood head down. Where there's smoke there's
[2747.08s -> 2752.68s]  fire. Hmm well with her history she's bound to already be in the sights of the neighborhood
[2752.68s -> 2757.96s]  watch. So we'll find out soon enough. My thoughts exactly. Am I inside of like this is what they're
[2757.96s -> 2769.66s]  texting together? That was uh all right. Road closed. The road has completely collapsed into
[2769.66s -> 2774.94s]  the sinkhole. No wonder they closed it off. The ground is still crumbling. I don't remember there
[2774.94s -> 2785.43s]  being like ridiculous earthquakes in Massachusetts. This giant sinkhole. Here's the courthouse.
[2793.53s -> 2812.66s]  False judgment. False claim. What do we want? Justice. What do we want? Now.
[2812.74s -> 2835.00s]  What are we doing in the courthouse? Talk to Judge Danforth. Okay you got it. Hey what are you doing?
[2835.00s -> 2849.29s]  He's a judge Deirdre. Judge Danforth. Yeah hello. This is the restroom. My office is down the hall
[2849.29s -> 2862.10s]  to the left. Give me a minute. Nancy Drew. Carson's daughter. Yes and I'm with my friend.
[2862.10s -> 2873.22s]  Why do we talk? Is this a priest? Why do we talk through the door? Well you see no I mean I'd let
[2873.22s -> 2877.62s]  you in but I seem to have been locked in my office. No you can't come in the bathroom with me. What the
[2877.62s -> 2883.78s]  fuck are you talking about? I need some help getting out. But if you could give me some toilet
[2883.78s -> 2889.14s]  paper. There's not enough left. There's just enough to make it not be gross but I really don't want
[2889.14s -> 2899.88s]  to walk down the hall. If you could give me a grab me a new roll that'd be fantastic. Yes I believe
[2899.88s -> 2905.64s]  I gave a copy of the key to Alicia Cole as backup. She's just down the hall. I hope she's still here.
[2906.04s -> 2921.88s]  Wait so wait this guy locked himself in his office from the inside. Is that what we're led to believe
[2921.88s -> 2942.78s]  here? That's not even possible. You can't do that unless you glued the door shut. I can't go in these
[2942.78s -> 2954.28s]  rooms. Ah yes you see I accidentally glued the whole seam of the door and held it in place for
[2954.36s -> 2955.00s]  three hours.
[2957.48s -> 2962.36s]  Hi so sorry to bother you at this hour but we're here to meet with Judge Danforth
[2963.00s -> 2967.56s]  and he seems to be locked inside his office. He said you might have a key.
[2969.16s -> 2977.56s]  Sorry I gave him my spare. Unbelievable. Does this ever end? What? Oh well then um he has a key and
[2977.56s -> 2981.80s]  he's only inside and we're gonna take if you don't mind me asking the lock to his door. What business
[2982.12s -> 2987.56s]  do you two have? And he's inside the door. We're helping the judge with a case. Anything I can
[2987.56s -> 2994.52s]  assist you with? Thanks but I think we got it. No need for a lawyer at least not yet. The diploma
[2994.52s -> 3000.28s]  gave me away huh? Aside from the cold coffee you're still drinking and the deluxe open box of sticky
[3000.28s -> 3006.76s]  tabs yeah you could say I know the type really well. Nancy Drew you really are your father's
[3006.76s -> 3013.08s]  daughter. It's nice to finally meet you. You know my dad. Small world. Books. If you need
[3013.08s -> 3026.57s]  any assistance or thick ass books. Feel free to ask. All right let's go pick the judge's luck
[3029.34s -> 3037.66s]  paper clip. Judge Danforth I couldn't find your key. What? Alicia said she'd keep a copy for me.
[3038.30s -> 3044.22s]  Well I did find a paper clip. I think I can pick your luck if that's okay with you.
[3045.10s -> 3054.87s]  Yeah sure fine. Oh no wait I have to actually pick the lock. Just open the fucking door judge.
[3055.75s -> 3067.11s]  Open the door. Just grab it and turn it. All right hold to drag pin. Feel for the pin that gives
[3067.11s -> 3082.92s]  resistance. Release. Hold to drag pin. Feel for release when the pin locks in place. Don't you go
[3082.92s -> 3133.59s]  like it's this one. I had it. No this one. Efficient. How'd you learn to do that actually?
[3134.23s -> 3139.83s]  Online video tutorial. Someday you have to tell me about your secret life of breaking and entering
[3139.83s -> 3148.04s]  Drew because you're in danger of being cool which honestly I just don't like. Someday. What the fuck
[3148.04s -> 3166.47s]  are you talking about? What does that even mean? The game just crashed. No we just got into the
[3166.47s -> 3190.65s]  judge's door. Arrested. All right hold on. That did it does this game save? Does this game actually
[3190.65s -> 3217.05s]  save? Stop right there criminal scum. Will we ever learn? Will we ever learn? There's been decades
[3217.05s -> 3224.89s]  of video game development. Decades. Decades of this shit and you're telling me that in
[3225.93s -> 3233.38s]  decades of development we're still everybody and this is from what this is from like single
[3233.38s -> 3240.09s]  a all the way up to the major leagues in video game development. Why do you have your splash screens
[3240.09s -> 3250.73s]  at maximum goddamn volume? Why? It's like do you not open your game? Do you not open the game?
[3250.73s -> 3255.13s]  You have to open the game like a thousand times in the debug menus. Open your game before you
[3255.13s -> 3263.03s]  give it to people. How many times have we opened a video game and it's like okay let's open this
[3263.03s -> 3283.29s]  video game. Like that happens so often. It's like how does that keep happening? Suffer me now. Why
[3283.29s -> 3312.30s]  do you say that? Oh we got in. Like posture. That's posture. So you're doing that on purpose.
[3315.42s -> 3327.99s]  Is this money? Those protesters are out there again stirring the pot. You know this town used
[3328.31s -> 3334.63s]  to be. That's that's an oxygen mask. Seems lately there's been an element. Reused assets. This is an
[3334.63s -> 3338.07s]  oxygen mask. One of those troublemakers locked my door and threw away the key.
[3338.95s -> 3346.79s]  Now Nancy your father and I have discussed. Oh sorry I'm not Nancy. Of course you're not. You
[3346.79s -> 3351.99s]  look nothing like Carson. Did your father ever tell you about the time we won fourth place at
[3351.99s -> 3360.23s]  the lake Winnipeg? You told me how you locked yourself in an office and had to have a like
[3360.23s -> 3365.27s]  17 year old open your door with a lockpick. She's working with me on the case. I don't know how old
[3365.27s -> 3372.79s]  am I? You're the one who tried to break down my door. Break down? Your honor that's an exaggeration.
[3373.35s -> 3380.47s]  I was knocking heavily. Look I'm really busy dealing with this Hathorn house business.
[3381.43s -> 3388.95s]  Being a judge is not as simple as you know investigating. Break down the door. Well we
[3388.95s -> 3395.11s]  just used our free time to unlock your door so I'm sure you'll be willing to repay us with some
[3395.11s -> 3399.51s]  answers to our questions. Don't look in the corner. Yeah how long have you been locked in here? Yes of
[3399.51s -> 3406.47s]  course. What can I help you girls with? Yeah pay no attention to the six bags of uber eats that are
[3406.47s -> 3410.71s]  over here. I was having the delivery drivers football throw them through the window.
[3413.43s -> 3423.32s]  Sorry. How are you involved? I was told the burning of Hathorn house is suspected. I was told that
[3423.32s -> 3429.00s]  the burning of Hathorn house is suspected to be a case of arson. How did the police come to that
[3429.00s -> 3435.80s]  conclusion? The investigation found paint solvent residue on burnt embers suggesting someone
[3435.80s -> 3442.20s]  deliberately used an accelerant. Thankfully Mrs. Tuttle never had to see what became of her home.
[3443.16s -> 3449.32s]  And what evidence do you have that Mae Perry is the one responsible for this? Evidence? Have you
[3449.32s -> 3453.08s]  ever heard of recidivism? I don't know if that's what it is. Three out of four criminals in the
[3453.08s -> 3459.40s]  United States are repeat offenders and there's only one person in all of Salem who has a history of
[3459.40s -> 3465.72s]  fire related crime. So there is no evidence. What are you talking about? Not yet but there will be.
[3465.72s -> 3470.68s]  Isn't this a judge? You don't need evidence. She's already been convicted in the court of public
[3470.68s -> 3477.00s]  opinion. What is this thing? I'm a fucking judge. No I'm saying. I went to law school and she spent
[3477.00s -> 3483.56s]  decades doing this. What's Mae's motive? What does she gain by burning down the Hathorn house?
[3483.56s -> 3489.00s]  You'd have to ask her and while you're at it you can ask about her alibi which she refused to give
[3489.00s -> 3498.10s]  to the police. So any other questions? Sure. Can you explain to us how you're involved with
[3498.10s -> 3506.18s]  the Hathorn house? Well yes the house was built by Judge John Hathorn during the 60s and it
[3506.18s -> 3512.50s]  represented the oldest surviving structure from that era. Judge Hathorn was one of the three judges
[3512.50s -> 3518.82s]  that presided over the Salem witch trials. Yes and I'm sure we can read all about the home's history
[3518.82s -> 3524.90s]  in Salem's museum. More recently Francis Tuttle, Judge Hathorn's last direct descendant,
[3525.54s -> 3529.38s]  lived in a small section of the house for the rest was left. I was almost, I almost got your
[3529.38s -> 3534.34s]  master's in the league and you interrupted me. That's why the door was locked. A part-time
[3534.34s -> 3543.26s]  caregiver, Laura Bedroom in the carriage house. A few months ago Francis Tuttle passed away
[3543.98s -> 3550.38s]  which left Hathorn house without a legal heir. According to the historical statutes of Salem
[3550.38s -> 3557.82s]  after 90 days the house reverts to public property the deadline which is two days from now
[3557.82s -> 3566.42s]  at midnight. Okay so why to the book of apologies why did you need it? So the book of apologies
[3567.14s -> 3573.66s]  why did you really need it? Yes and first of all I'm so glad you're all right. Nasty business.
[3574.30s -> 3578.62s]  Had I known you were going to be put in harm's way I would have never called Carson and asked
[3578.62s -> 3586.22s]  for his help. So you're responsible for a magician stealing it? Trust me I can handle myself. Yes
[3586.22s -> 3593.50s]  I'm sure you can. So I've already heard some stories but would you mind giving me your version
[3593.50s -> 3601.42s]  of why the book is important? Yes so Judge Sewell was rumored to keep a ledger of all the accused
[3601.98s -> 3605.74s]  intending to publish it to reconcile with their families and clear their names
[3606.70s -> 3612.70s]  but he passed away before he could do so. Going to Austria for a rumored book seems like a heck of
[3612.70s -> 3621.42s]  a long shot. Who are you again? I have been under some pressure from the AW group. AW as in accused
[3621.42s -> 3629.96s]  witches. All right well talk to you later. Talk to you later don't get locked in your office. Before
[3629.96s -> 3637.34s]  you go there is something else I need your help with. Not locked out of your car are you? Please
[3637.34s -> 3645.90s]  say yes. Oh no there was a there was an incident here recently. Someone broke into the evidence
[3645.90s -> 3655.37s]  room. Well I know not yet I don't think anything was taken. Never mind I'll call the police. Thank
[3655.37s -> 3672.46s]  you for your time. Evidence room let's go. Photo of him too. Where's the evidence room? Evidence
[3672.46s -> 3689.02s]  room this way. How do I get in the evidence room? Scan the photo. Rust. It's a rusty door. Use the
[3689.02s -> 3700.34s]  weird key. Take out the camera. Can I hey can I go in the evidence room right? So how did your
[3700.34s -> 3707.93s]  meeting go? Informative. Don't worry come back tomorrow. Come back tomorrow? I have to go back
[3707.93s -> 3713.05s]  what do you mean come back tomorrow? There's a day night cycle in this game. What can I help you girls?
[3716.39s -> 3727.75s]  Talk to you later. All right fine whatever all right let's go. Walk him back in the office.
[3728.31s -> 3745.38s]  They're protesters in a small town like this. What is that? What was that?
[3751.34s -> 3762.89s]  They're protesters in a small town like this. That was recorded that's like that's not an outside voice.
[3766.41s -> 3770.57s]  Skyrim mod voice acting what is I don't even know what that means but it's funny.
[3771.21s -> 3792.02s]  X-Fox Mike. X-Fox Mike. Oh stop you guys are gonna hurt me. Let's visit the cemetery. I want a picture of little liberty.
[3793.70s -> 3801.19s]  What? All right let's go. It'll be more useful to explore the graveyard with a tour guide.
[3802.23s -> 3807.03s]  It'll be more useful to explore. No the game's fresh.
[3807.75s -> 3819.58s]  This way. The Salem Museum. What is this the bar? It's locked. We're going to the bar. Wait can we not
[3819.58s -> 3831.40s]  go I mean not a lot of going to the bar. All right the bar. Wait how old are we? Maybe we can learn
[3831.40s -> 3838.55s]  something about. Get away from me. You're just in the way. Look at how much okay if I move this
[3838.55s -> 3843.59s]  way for instance right I'm going this way. Now I'm gonna turn this way and this she takes up so
[3843.59s -> 3849.21s]  much screen real estate. Just like put her over here. Have her be like the Microsoft paperclip
[3849.21s -> 3870.82s]  that I can click on. Street art in Salem coming soon. What's this? Remembering the wrongly accused
[3870.82s -> 3888.97s]  may history never again be repeated. Nothing. Okay hold to look. Something else? There's probably
[3888.97s -> 3894.09s]  like a little tab I can push. The figure of a Puritan woman accused of being a witch.
[3894.81s -> 3900.25s]  These were ordinary people just like anyone else. Yeah all of a sudden it's this this I'm
[3900.25s -> 3904.57s]  gonna lean in it's gonna be like ah they're gonna scream it's gonna be an actor that's doing the
[3904.57s -> 3913.27s]  I'm the statue thing. I'm getting unsuspecting people. The figure of. Now you're in the way.
[3913.27s -> 3928.39s]  Get out of the way. I want to talk to you. Wait all right I'm back. I'm here.
[3930.95s -> 3934.71s]  Hey sorry about the mess. We're in the middle of installing a big showcase.
[3935.35s -> 3941.51s]  So what have you seen in town so far? We decided to do the real witches tour. Oh no we didn't. Talk
[3941.51s -> 3948.63s]  to Olivia. It's a lie. What's with her get up? Witch? Street magician maybe? Everyone has to
[3948.63s -> 3954.79s]  make a living. Is she telling the story about a coven living here in the recent past? Yeah. Yeah
[3955.35s -> 3962.63s]  why? Just bad taste. What about the photo of you that says coven? I hope you don't mind if we do
[3962.63s -> 3969.11s]  the tour. I want to see more of the town and finding out a place's old superstitions is kind
[3969.11s -> 3975.99s]  of a habit I've gotten into. I'm excited to look around the museum. Of course. We got a ticket. Wait
[3975.99s -> 3991.61s]  a minute. Wait a minute is this the oh it's a raffle ticket. Does this mean? Why can't I not
[3991.61s -> 4002.06s]  show this photo to you? Aren't you in this photo? Go on the witch tour. Admissions.
[4003.02s -> 4010.90s]  25 dollars. This better be good. Closed off. Looks like they're preparing a new installation.
[4011.70s -> 4033.22s]  Stray book. You see it. I do. Told you. Somebody will end up reading this somehow.
[4034.10s -> 4040.39s]  What about this one? Sad that even children are named in the list of those accused witches
[4040.39s -> 4048.84s]  like Abigail Johnson. Just 11. This one. Anything else? Turn page. Wait somebody will read this.
[4049.64s -> 4071.16s]  Any codes? Everything you could ever want to know about Salem's history. From the Namkiag people
[4071.16s -> 4076.78s]  to the great Salem fire. Cool. All right so let's go on the tour. And this is gonna happen. This is
[4076.78s -> 4081.58s]  the intro of the game. We're gonna go on the tour. Something bad's gonna happen. This is gonna be a
[4081.98s -> 4084.94s]  this is gonna be a fight's gonna break out and we're gonna have to
[4085.82s -> 4088.38s]  this is gonna be a ghost that attacks us. I know I've seen it already.
[4097.30s -> 4101.54s]  That's the guy that was stuck in the conversation and he's still stuck and he's still pretending
[4101.54s -> 4105.46s]  that he oh no no never mind that tree with arms just proved us wrong never mind.
[4106.74s -> 4121.21s]  Let's go on the tour. I have a ticket. This tour sounds interesting. Welcome on my tour. Thank you.
[4121.29s -> 4130.73s]  Well welcome on my tour. Found a tablet. Is it which what? They give you an ipad?
[4131.45s -> 4147.82s]  Look for the raven and place the tablet over the spots of interest. Okay look for me. So this is
[4147.82s -> 4156.50s]  not a tour. This is an app. Uh oh here comes trouble. How'd you do that trick? How did you
[4156.50s -> 4162.98s]  perform that trick? A witch never reveals her secrets. It's against the witch code. Magician.
[4163.06s -> 4167.86s]  A code. I thought bureaucracy and rules were. That's why that guy wore the mask
[4167.86s -> 4173.62s]  when he did all the reveal secrets on that tv show. I promise you will learn at least one secret
[4173.62s -> 4178.66s]  about being a witch. Remember that show? Remember the guy that did showed all the magic secrets
[4180.02s -> 4185.18s]  and he was in that that full head mask because he didn't want anyone to know who he was?
[4187.16s -> 4192.52s]  Talk to you. Like it was something was like somehow dangerous for him to not have that mask on.
[4193.48s -> 4196.76s]  That's what was sort of like implied like he needs to wear this mask
[4196.76s -> 4209.50s]  otherwise the fucking magicians are coming for him. That show was fucking pretty good actually.
[4209.50s -> 4224.36s]  All right look for the birds. How about this? Bring light into the darkness. Bring light.
[4224.36s -> 4240.66s]  Put your ipad on it. It's a very high tech statue or something that was made
[4240.74s -> 4244.58s]  until the judge caught her in the act and locked her up in a cell deep within the
[4244.58s -> 4258.06s]  Hathorn house. The statue was given the name little. I'm just doing what I'm just doing
[4258.06s -> 4273.29s]  with you y'all. This is real life. Okay uh cool so I got one. The big tree. No smoking. Wait.
[4275.21s -> 4310.42s]  Can't see it from here. Must be deeper in. Scan the raven. Let's kick on. This is when you start to
[4310.42s -> 4317.10s]  realize that like oh man was this like I didn't I thought no not anymore not anymore
[4318.06s -> 4331.26s]  they do like haunted houses and shit here now. When does this game take place? Today.
[4338.39s -> 4350.76s]  Oh it's just like it's like ipad like little ipad burn mark just like this thing is fucking hot.
[4350.76s -> 4360.54s]  I can't fucking hold it. Can't use that here. You guys have a okay I I'm gonna tell you I'm
[4360.54s -> 4368.14s]  an ipad the master of the ipad but this is a real story and you guys are gonna know if you also have
[4368.14s -> 4376.73s]  ipads some apps actually hurt to use because they make the ipad so hot that it's hard to even hold
[4376.73s -> 4387.67s]  it after a while. Can't use that. What I'm saying is not oh well that's funny but easy. Sometimes
[4387.67s -> 4392.87s]  I use my ipad and I use like a game that's really high graphic integrity and this thing hurts to
[4392.87s -> 4407.64s]  hold. All right can I just we're just gonna go around and do this so I can get my drink ticket
[4407.64s -> 4412.68s]  for later. This is what you have to do all right yeah yeah yeah cool but we did the thing we did

[4677.91s -> 4683.51s]  saving us some stream time if you typed in right now Salem witch trials and then went to Wikipedia
[4683.51s -> 4687.91s]  you get all this info and you could do it whenever you that's it's just an info dump
[4689.35s -> 4696.58s]  we don't need to know all this to understand that like the judge that we just talked to is
[4696.58s -> 4701.30s]  gonna we're gonna pull a mask off of them in like 25 minutes it's gonna be him we don't need that

[4826.04s -> 4832.68s]  witches escape the trials some even believe that Abigail's ghost still walks the forest
[4832.68s -> 4839.32s]  surrounding the Hathorn house her twisted soul now dragging the living into the afterlife
[4840.68s -> 4850.41s]  all right talk to you later talk with me again do you really believe some modern witch coven
[4850.41s -> 4855.93s]  unleashed do you really believe some modern about eight years back there were rumors of a coven
[4856.01s -> 4862.17s]  that they performed a ritual to return the dead witches to fail to seek out their revenge
[4862.17s -> 4867.77s]  there any evidence of such a coven ever since then ghost sightings have gone through the roof
[4868.41s -> 4874.73s]  Salem is now considered the most haunted place in the country and it better stay that way you
[4874.73s -> 4880.01s]  think it's a coincidence because otherwise I ain't selling ipad apps to tourists anymore it's so

[4944.26s -> 4947.62s]  i heard there was not a single living soul in the house when it started burning
[4948.58s -> 4956.47s]  the keyword living is composed of two equal parts why did you pick the worst nancy drew

[4971.03s -> 4978.74s]  pain of existence that vibrates just underneath the light but if you were in a place like Salem
[4979.30s -> 4985.38s]  place where a painful history it's not me it's every surface i bought all of them there's a
[4985.38s -> 4991.22s]  bundle where you can buy fucking all of them i just compulsively bought them all so it doesn't matter
[4992.18s -> 5001.32s]  we'll play them all that's why they say don't be out past midnight Salem can you reach out

[5063.88s -> 5070.20s]  excuse me what exactly are you guys protesting only the greatest injustice that happened in
[5070.20s -> 5074.60s]  Salem since 1692 they're gonna give that house to the state's justice

[5284.94s -> 5293.18s]  and i never said i was brilliant either if she trusts you she'll open up and tell you the truth

[5413.94s -> 5419.30s]  on me all we need is an alibi and then they can't charge you with anything and they're not going to
[5419.30s -> 5425.54s]  have anything on me because he can't prove i did it then why not just give the police an alibi

[7590.54s -> 7596.94s]  ancestors it's one of the reasons i search for the book of apologies in austria now i'm gonna do the
[7597.02s -> 7603.35s]  courtesy eat where you sit down at somebody's house and you don't want to eat it all and you
[7603.35s -> 7606.79s]  know that everyone else is going to be eating it's like you're at the something on the family's
[7606.79s -> 7611.51s]  house or something you have to at least eat the corners you have to eat the ring around the edge
[7612.07s -> 7615.67s]  i'd like to review the crime scene at the courthouse for any and then explain
[7616.79s -> 7622.23s]  more than five times he didn't sound very forthcoming that you've already eaten and oh

[8014.33s -> 8020.81s]  unbelievable you know i've started asking myself what is happening in this town it used to be such
[8020.81s -> 8025.13s]  as arson's and where there's a pattern here arson it's the kind of place i want to raise my kids
[8025.61s -> 8031.45s]  oh you're trying to start a thing i mean yes i want to start a family but who has time work
[8031.45s -> 8036.65s]  when is the end to be honest and the people living in this place like salem is not i'm not
[8036.65s -> 8041.53s]  really into salem how about you i have a boy really he doesn't accompany you you know he's not part
[8041.53s -> 8047.21s]  of your little trips of the thing that you're doing well he's apart he's far away and we've
[8047.21s -> 8050.81s]  been dating for a couple of years no one said it was easy it's not easy to do long-distance
[8050.81s -> 8056.89s]  relationships all i'll say is most men don't understand what we go through we have to fight
[8056.89s -> 8060.89s]  to get a seat at their table and then they want us to go home and be family makers
[8061.45s -> 8066.57s]  some unsolicited advice from one working woman to another don't let his plans get in the way of
[8066.57s -> 8079.64s]  yours of course that's not bad advice does you do you you all right you do you they don't what uh
[8079.64s -> 8085.56s]  how about doing some follow-ups with the arson where were you that night where were you did you

[8106.65s -> 8113.13s]  like saying this but the judge occasionally all right sometimes the judge uh sometimes the judge
[8113.13s -> 8118.57s]  sleepwalks the man even locked himself in his own office for pity's sake not that it matters
[8118.57s -> 8124.65s]  i was told the burglar came from the outside well then is it he's probably leaving doors open
[8126.97s -> 8132.57s]  liking me for this crime nancy no i don't like anyone for this crime or any other crime for
[8132.57s -> 8139.00s]  that matter i was not here i was running errands what's the code of the evidence room do you have

[8150.18s -> 8155.38s]  your hammer drill well after the burglary we realized that this place was in dire need of
[8155.38s -> 8160.34s]  higher security i ordered the keypad online and used the drill to mount it that's impressive

[9235.51s -> 9238.47s]  that corroborated the same story that that's supposed to be accurate unless they're working
[9238.47s -> 9244.63s]  together maybe you should ride with me to the beach i can show you no thanks no thank you

[9297.98s -> 9303.26s]  acts surprised about repeated offenders they better book her before halloween i don't want
[9303.26s -> 9311.86s]  to let the kids out trick-or-treating with an arsonist on the loose here's the thing
[9312.50s -> 9321.34s]  oh should we take the witch door you're not gonna if they what i don't understand that logic all
[9321.34s -> 9330.28s]  right uh where i need to go i did not investigate the break-in good enough i need a key to the house

[9348.84s -> 9360.25s]  all right i need to go i'm gonna go to the museum text user has been added to the chat what chat
[9360.25s -> 9365.45s]  did i just get dragged into an annoying famous nancy drew finally arrived to solve our ghostly
[9365.45s -> 9372.09s]  conundrums what is this oh it's an obnoxious group chat that you can not get read out of
[9372.73s -> 9376.33s]  and we're gonna blow up your phone all fucking day there's like 10 people in here
[9377.21s -> 9382.73s]  and if you leave this conversation then we all know that you didn't want to be here in the first
[9382.73s -> 9396.33s]  place so you have to stomach this every single fucking day every day until you inevitably leave
[9397.13s -> 9403.13s]  the conversation and then you text every person that was in that conversation you say hey my
[9403.21s -> 9408.95s]  phone was stolen last night i have and i have to get a new phone number
[9413.94s -> 9422.22s]  okay i don't know this is just absolutely just gibberish uh we're trying to figure out what
[9422.22s -> 9427.50s]  could have caused you to see a ghost maybe an actual ghost like this only in the good days
[9427.50s -> 9432.30s]  hey i'm here you know we know we know oh cute uh dude i'm gonna go follow some leads good luck

[9448.76s -> 9454.44s]  where were you you know it would really help if i could get may to talk to me she hasn't given her
[9454.44s -> 9460.92s]  alibi yet no and everyone seems to have one except her how do i know that i talk to one two people is
[9460.92s -> 9467.16s]  it possible that it could be someone from outside of town a visitor or something absolutely but
[9467.16s -> 9474.09s]  statistically speaking crime is rarely a random occurrence it's a mystery to me what you have
[9474.09s -> 9485.80s]  anything you wanted to talk about crime is not usually a random occurrence is that true
[9486.52s -> 9496.14s]  that feels yeah that feels that's like not true the person that like steals your purse on the
[9496.14s -> 9505.29s]  sidewalk is an old family friend okay what's the history behind uh the hathorne estate what's the
[9505.29s -> 9510.49s]  history behind the hathorne estate that's how you pronounce it right well uh judge john hathorne was
[9510.49s -> 9515.29s]  born and raised in salem his father was a decorated military man who had many real estate
[9515.29s -> 9521.05s]  holdings throughout new england and when judge hathorne became a justice he tried to expand
[9521.05s -> 9526.41s]  those holdings much of the land that the hathorne estate was built on was actually seized perhaps
[9527.77s -> 9534.94s]  all right cool is the fire somehow related do you think the fire is somehow related to salem's
[9534.94s -> 9540.46s]  history with what do you mean like is it meant as a symbolic gesture that was a european thing
[9540.46s -> 9545.98s]  no they were more civilized in the new world no i think they just did it for no reason
[9548.90s -> 9553.30s]  it was a random crime you know that most crimes are random right why would you even ask me that
[9554.73s -> 9563.46s]  pressed yeah they put a bunch of heavy stones on top of you a bit of days that's horrible she did
[9563.46s -> 9569.94s]  not know the way until she felt the freedom scarlet letter also a descendant of judge hathorne
[9570.50s -> 9575.54s]  except nathaniel hawthorne was so horrified with his family's history that he added a w
[9575.54s -> 9582.63s]  to change it wow the focus on descendants isn't really yep we think our world is so much more

[9895.83s -> 9900.79s]  made people look like they were possessed or made the judges think they were doing god's will or
[9900.87s -> 9907.11s]  make the whole town go haywire a rational explanation for irrational behavior just a
[9907.11s -> 9913.43s]  theory we'll never know anyway i don't want to keep you thanks for stopping by thank you by the

[12683.53s -> 12692.89s]  might be footage from the break-in with all right let's go missing evidence and to get a
[12692.89s -> 12703.67s]  list of everything that's missing judge i'm afraid i haven't been completely honest with you nancy
[12704.63s -> 12711.86s]  what let's just say i can tell when someone is trying to hide something from me the reason
[12711.86s -> 12718.42s]  karson sent you to mosem castle was because i already knew what was stolen from the courthouse
[12718.42s -> 12723.94s]  tegan perry had assembled a packet of documents outlining her accused witch's claims on the
[12723.94s -> 12731.37s]  half-born house they were compelling and i believe she had a real claim but now missing
[12734.46s -> 12738.06s]  someone from sweden i must admit that i've already figured out the entire storyline
[12738.06s -> 12739.90s]  i'll hold my tongue for you americans though
[12739.90s -> 12751.05s]  oh
[12751.05s -> 12759.19s]  uh okay do you remember do you have the cctv footage from the break-in yes we do
[12760.39s -> 12765.62s]  huh and completely forgot didn't even turn the cameras off and he broke into his own house
[12767.06s -> 12770.42s]  of course oh you see nancy i haven't been completely honest with you
[12771.78s -> 12777.54s]  you know how i locked myself in places well i was going in the evidence room to get a snack
[12778.50s -> 12785.22s]  and then i got stuck in the cage so i just picked up the computer desk and smashed it into the window
[12786.34s -> 12795.54s]  and climbed out i do this once in a week i need help i need to be helped do you remember any
[12795.54s -> 12803.62s]  details about the aw evidence i don't remember much unfortunately oh there was this key with
[12803.62s -> 12813.70s]  its blade shape to spell aw very not sure what it was connected to like this one yes that's it
[12813.70s -> 12820.02s]  where did you find this just missing a ton of painful reverb yeah the theft of the book of
[12820.02s -> 12825.86s]  apologies and the theft of evidence from the courthouse someone is going to great lengths
[12825.86s -> 12832.10s]  to prevent the aw organization from having a claim on the half-born estate any educated
[12832.26s -> 12840.58s]  guess who that might be practically everybody in this town everyone has a carnival attraction
[12840.58s -> 12846.86s]  and i'm sure lauren carnival oh i love carnivals have to dig deeper well you'll need to do it
[12846.86s -> 12883.59s]  quickly i unfortunately must file the second bugleberry is it audible two thousand people
[12883.59s -> 12902.73s]  leave okay what evidence who cares that is a somewhat complicated question so many moving
[12902.73s -> 12908.73s]  parts and interested parties with crossover jurisdictions you're the one who decides i feel
[12908.73s -> 12913.45s]  like that's like this on the same level as a slap i can tell you're not happy about being the center
[12913.45s -> 12920.49s]  it's pretty close well it's muddy legally and complicated for other reasons because it's not
[12920.49s -> 12930.66s]  just who lives there is history yes not to be taken lightly okay uh where were you when this
[12930.66s -> 12937.69s]  evidence was stolen when this evidence was stolen if you can believe it i was here working i have
[12937.69s -> 12942.41s]  no reason to steal the evidence trust me how would you not know this is happening headaches
[12942.41s -> 12948.33s]  than i care to admit headaches i got something for that i it's cinnamon and fever few mash it
[12948.33s -> 12954.41s]  up into a bowl and then pour it in water hot water and then drink it do you have diarrhea too
[12954.41s -> 12960.01s]  i can fix that do you mind me asking what you were doing three days ago

[13540.86s -> 13546.46s]  i just want to say i know you're trying to help but i said you used to hang out with the the
[13546.46s -> 13552.70s]  hathorne house right you said you did you ever see any like ghosts were there ghosts there no
[13552.70s -> 13558.73s]  oh do you feel ready to talk about your alibi where were you you don't even have a passport
[13559.29s -> 13564.49s]  i don't go anywhere so i wasn't in austria if that's what you're thinking and no i'm talking
[13564.49s -> 13572.33s]  about the house the house that burnt down people tell me there's a good reason to suspect you
[13573.05s -> 13578.65s]  but isn't it obvious we've got a burn mark covering the entire side of my face and like most of my
[13579.21s -> 13586.33s]  arms it must be me i'm sorry that happened to you and i'm sorry if people judge you for your burns
[13586.33s -> 13594.09s]  i prefer it to pity would you tell me what happened there was a fire i was in it wait wait hold on a
[13594.09s -> 13599.77s]  second it's just that so far the main cause for suspecting you of the hathorne fire seems to be
[13599.77s -> 13606.65s]  this previous one i only want to understand oh okay yeah i was nine it was an old shed and i
[13606.65s -> 13614.33s]  wasn't supposed to play in it it was kind of a den full of stuff like candles i got stuck inside
[13615.29s -> 13622.25s]  you can work out the rest so it was an accident you were just a kid harsh to suspect you now
[13622.25s -> 13629.37s]  because of something you didn't mean to happen don't make me talk about it more okay talk to you
[13630.09s -> 13651.54s]  is that you all right i gather alibis for the search the house for clues
[13652.34s -> 13660.25s]  no i'm sick of the house is it nighttime yet it's nighttime no it's not god damn it who have i not
[13660.25s -> 13671.18s]  talked to about their alibi there's one person i haven't spoken to where were you by the way
[13671.18s -> 13684.74s]  where are you dear dra dear dra fancy zero it's not funny come on because now i know how much you
[13684.74s -> 13691.22s]  care of course i care dear don't laugh that despite your best efforts well anyway information i have
[13691.22s -> 13697.54s]  some information for you francis tuttle she's the former owner of what well i thought you were going
[13697.54s -> 13704.26s]  to read it all goes back to francis it all leads to here she took over the hathorne house estate in
[13704.34s -> 13710.18s]  1992 although i found three different marriage announcements in the salem news she was never
[13710.18s -> 13716.98s]  married and never had any biological children the only living heir now is lauren holt she met
[13716.98s -> 13724.18s]  francis tuttle and was officially adopted in 2006 the judge said there was a will lauren confirmed
[13724.18s -> 13730.82s]  that that exactly but as far as i can tell there is no will nothing was ever filed with the town
[13731.54s -> 13736.42s]  just repeat the last word of somewhat important sounding sentences it sounds like you're
[13736.42s -> 13744.82s]  comprehending what you're being told confused yeah you think that lauren burned down her own house
[13744.82s -> 13755.11s]  sounds bizarre i know it's the most likely scenario it is because a historic property is classified
[13755.67s -> 13759.67s]  if it's a ruin versus being an intact that's right intact structure
[13760.31s -> 13769.38s]  a ruined property is preserved as is so lauren stayed there now living in a chart out building
[13769.38s -> 13772.90s]  that's the way to make somebody that's talking to you about things that they know you don't know for
[13772.90s -> 13778.10s]  you to make it sound like you actually know it already so you say it at the same time as them
[13779.22s -> 13785.38s]  and then they are just like oh you you know this already but you're just letting me talk
[13785.38s -> 13807.14s]  about it thanks for the info all right let's go all right i want something has to happen here
[13807.86s -> 13812.50s]  i need to have something happen i can't exit the game but i need to something has to happen
[13812.50s -> 13820.14s]  right now no herbs no fucking spices no food no pancakes something give me like a give me
[13820.14s -> 13823.74s]  like a weapon to attack a monster with like give me the crowbar and let me hit the monster in the
[13823.74s -> 13835.29s]  head you don't feel conflicted so i burn it down as revenge for a three tituba seems as much an
[13835.29s -> 13842.06s]  influx have you ever seen the capitol building okay no not what not what herbs do you have
[13843.02s -> 13854.36s]  all right i gotta go back to the house the road i have that key but why couldn't i use it on
[13854.36s -> 13869.46s]  there before because i was told it was gonna work god and make sure you check out nancy drew
[13870.18s -> 13873.38s]  and i'm not gonna look at what the name of the game is because i don't know what it is
[13873.38s -> 13877.78s]  the name of this game that came out two days ago the new nancy drew the nancy drew and
[13879.30s -> 13889.30s]  the shadow the shadow of salem no nancy drew and the midnight at salem did i get it something like
[13889.30s -> 13898.42s]  that the midnight at salem salem midnight salem nancy drew salem at midnight what's it called
[13899.06s -> 13917.48s]  nancy drew in the half blood prince nancy drew and the sorcerer's stone nancy drew
[13919.40s -> 13925.78s]  nancy drew the philosopher's stone can't use that here how does that make any sense
[13925.78s -> 13959.24s]  what are you talking about can't use no fucking way no way how do i open this there's a second

[15149.98s -> 15156.70s]  sure it actually works of course i built it myself the device has a top of the line scanner that can
[15156.70s -> 15162.14s]  detect any disturbances it might not have found anything yet but you have to stay optimistic
[15162.14s -> 15168.86s]  about these things and i guess this is $800 paperweight thoroughly researched this shit's
[15168.86s -> 15179.80s]  picking up the power lines bro all right let's hunt for ghosts let's hunt for the blood on the

[16272.60s -> 16278.12s]  going to admit you were wrong of course not all we've proven is that there are no ghosts here
[16278.76s -> 16287.24s]  so you still think ghosts exist behind you they don't not exist say that again look the absence of
[16287.24s -> 16291.08s]  proof does not mean that we can disprove their existence but what it does tell me is that what
[16291.08s -> 16296.68s]  nancy saw was not a real ghost so who has something to gain by setting up a fake haunting
[16297.32s -> 16303.72s]  olivia olivia that's right there's got to be some evidence linking her to it let's go

[17846.12s -> 17852.04s]  oh shit so far the evidence seems to be indicating that we should focus on may that we should focus
[17852.04s -> 17857.96s]  on lauren that someone is lying about their alibi well that's obvious someone is lying about their
[17857.96s -> 17864.68s]  alibi didn't you interview everyone everyone except for may but i don't think she did it
[17864.68s -> 17868.76s]  nancy if you're missing an alibi wouldn't you think that that person has something to hide
[17869.56s -> 17873.88s]  may is protecting something i think it was two people i need to figure out what i think it was
[17873.88s -> 17883.40s]  may and you well don't stop there go on i don't know yet you can stay here she said she might be
[17883.56s -> 17917.83s]  late you're now playing as nancy drew nice plan nancy hey hi it's just i already made it

[17924.87s -> 17931.75s]  is that okay with everyone is it i've already answered a litany of questions from these two
[17932.71s -> 17939.59s]  you want to ask them i'm sure they'd love to tell you okay ow what's wrong with you
[17939.59s -> 17949.43s]  my hands feel like pins and needles i think i slept on them or yeah me too same what so is
[17949.43s -> 17957.58s]  anyone going to tell me what happened yesterday uh they saw it well they saw it it an anomalistic

[17969.10s -> 17974.54s]  be so upset if this is actually something different than all of you flashlight on his face and that's
[17974.54s -> 17981.50s]  the explanation with some fog machines i don't think so dear dra it's not an act she was genuinely
[17981.50s -> 17992.70s]  scared ergo no sorry not ergo er gut your hands erget poisoning you really think it's possible
[17992.70s -> 17997.66s]  mass psychogenic illness by more than one person hallucination leggo by echo restriction in the
[17997.66s -> 18007.40s]  hands and feet pins and needles exactly wait what what is that yeah but half food or drink
[18008.04s -> 18013.08s]  has been being poisoned this whole time i'd believe it what are you guys talking about
[18013.96s -> 18021.16s]  we could have been poisoned with erget poisoned what the symptoms match and it's not without
[18021.16s -> 18026.84s]  precedent especially here it says it here in this book it can actually come from the accusers of
[18026.84s -> 18031.40s]  the salem witch trials were exhibiting strange the culmination of the burnt sugars witchcraft
[18031.40s -> 18037.32s]  in burned pancakes eaten rye infected by erget spores and not washing your hands after making
[18037.32s -> 18042.76s]  food it was also pretty common 300 years ago i had an asahi super muscle builder smoothie for
[18042.76s -> 18048.44s]  lunch yesterday i did not eat some sort of pilgrim era right it's not urgot it's how could i get
[18048.44s -> 18053.64s]  it's like hepatitis a but i'd like to see if there are any sorry to burst everybody's bubble
[18053.64s -> 18059.40s]  here good idea but all the food we've been eating is my doing it's not so mysterious poisoning
[18063.13s -> 18069.75s]  you have e coli i touched raw hamburger meat before i made all your pancakes i visited the
[18069.75s -> 18081.11s]  hathorn house and i found olivia's jacket in plain view seems too obvious it is olivia has
[18081.11s -> 18086.23s]  been involved with some scare pranks in town mostly turning up business for her tour but we
[18086.23s -> 18091.19s]  don't think she's a suspect be fair they didn't eat anything you've made she was working working
[18091.19s -> 18098.62s]  as was everyone else and that was a will deaf okay no it was written by tuttle a letter written
[18098.62s -> 18102.54s]  could have been burned in the fire could be the reason for the fire that's true none of this
[18102.54s -> 18109.26s]  helps may that's right we need a perp a perp we should still try to find it it might be motive
[18109.26s -> 18114.86s]  i'll start with the judge i should finally be able to get the cctv access we'll figure it out but i
[18114.86s -> 18120.78s]  don't even know what an ergot spore looks we'll figure it out deer drove no oh time is running
[18121.50s -> 18125.50s]  if we don't clear may's name soon i hate to think what this town will do to

[18249.29s -> 18256.68s]  does well that's too bad good conversation i'm trying to condense it a little bit to speed things
[18256.68s -> 18266.92s]  up what they're skipping through the halls this time i've just realized that this case has taken
[18266.92s -> 18273.16s]  a turn about what i can hear the protesters how do you figure intentional poisoning usually has one
[18274.04s -> 18280.92s]  to eliminate the target someone was trying to kill us ergot poisoning at high enough doses ends
[18280.92s -> 18288.12s]  and gangrene which yeah it's pretty bad but it's not death you really think this was intentional
[18288.12s -> 18293.72s]  and not some you know accidental ingestion if you look at all the evidence yes
[18294.36s -> 18298.76s]  olivia's jack at the crime scene spray painting at the perry house everyone's obsession to get

[18364.06s -> 18369.74s]  was stolen you know nancy this detective thing is really sweet and all but we are in the middle
[18369.74s -> 18373.90s]  of something important here okay what what are you doing what is it what are you initiating the
[18373.90s -> 18378.62s]  process of handing over a half thorn house to the state so it can be turned into a museum
[18379.74s -> 18386.94s]  what it's our only option but you work for lauren it's her home and i'm getting her an extra 90
[18386.94s -> 18391.74s]  days before she's evicted which is 90 more than she would have had without me so we're a little
[18391.74s -> 18397.10s]  busy right now because we need to file this by the end of the day and may perry what about may
[18397.10s -> 18402.86s]  perry is she being charged i won't discuss this it's an active criminal investigation
[18403.50s -> 18409.66s]  but from what i've heard an arrest will happen later today so please come on dear dra
[18414.54s -> 18421.98s]  can't use that okay distract me drew so i don't go back in there and smash things
[18422.78s -> 18427.66s]  with i that's tell me what do you want to tell me some inane detail from your life so i feel
[18427.66s -> 18433.42s]  better when were you come off badly i know tell me what ned said when you told him you saw a ghost
[18434.78s -> 18441.66s]  oh shoot i totally you forgot you didn't call your boyfriend back a boyfriend drew all right

[18447.02s -> 18454.94s]  you're dumb how dare you that actually sounds like i know i hate you oh that's dad
[18456.38s -> 18464.30s]  it's been three days only daughter uh at two you okay how's the case coming along not well
[18465.26s -> 18470.06s]  i have a bunch of alibis but i'm missing something then there's the book of apologies
[18470.06s -> 18475.26s]  that's been stolen and the arson and a break-in at the courthouse and the judge called me an idiot
[18475.26s -> 18484.52s]  slow down what no excuse me what happened there what happened honey who's on your judge danforth
[18484.52s -> 18490.76s]  judge danforth okay look he's coming on strong trying to pin the crime on a girl without any
[18490.76s -> 18498.28s]  evidence it's a bit strange unbecoming he's supposed to be impartial but he's really going
[18498.28s -> 18505.96s]  after this one teenage girl may well look he was like a mentor to me in college we've kept in touch
[18506.04s -> 18508.68s]  but i do not know all the details of his situation
[18509.56s -> 18513.40s]  is he in financial trouble no could you make that happen to get a piece of property
[18514.04s -> 18519.96s]  i don't know which would be ironic because that's exactly what judge hathorne did in 1692
[18520.92s -> 18525.96s]  but may isn't involved at least from what i can see that's compromised ownership of the house
[18525.96s -> 18531.40s]  could be about the people may is related to go after her as means to hurt the ones she loves
[18531.96s -> 18536.44s]  it's extremely unsettling for a judge to do that but it has happened before
[18538.12s -> 18543.72s]  uh this is where we're supposed to piece it all down i'll talk to you later
[18545.02s -> 18560.92s]  i want to go watch this tape well i'm to us i'm hoping the cctv footage will prove it
[18560.92s -> 18568.44s]  bad news the footage isn't sorted we need to put it together in a timeline oh no hello i'm cammy
[18568.52s -> 18573.72s]  i can see that you're trying to find a suspect select cameras from the video source list add
[18573.72s -> 18578.20s]  footage to the timeline one image per numbered step all of your added images need to have a view
[18578.20s -> 18598.20s]  of the suspect good luck okay so he came into his office he scratched his head at the window
[18599.00s -> 18607.69s]  he went over to the corner sat in the chair is that different person they fall asleep at his desk
[18608.41s -> 18642.01s]  who's this who's that all right this is the break-in here's a break-in all right there's the judge
[18642.73s -> 18654.41s]  comes in he goes into the cabinet he goes over to the computer he leaves somebody was hiding in one
[18654.41s -> 18693.72s]  of the evidence drawers okay is outside gets into a car right there the courthouse i don't see
[18693.72s -> 18718.38s]  anything do you guys see anything why is there cameras in the bathrooms these cameras in the

[19904.94s -> 19908.94s]  good imagine being out in a graveyard in the middle of the night in the middle of cemetery
[19908.94s -> 19913.66s]  that's right and a random lady comes up to you and offers you tea to drink you were barely able
[19913.66s -> 19921.50s]  to get your drink down boys focus where exactly that's when you start to run she had just bought
[19921.50s -> 19930.46s]  it from lauren holt what about the water for the tea no idea i ask you to keep digging literally

[19946.41s -> 19951.61s]  the greek god whatever well the roman god what was it greek i've been testing the soil from various
[19951.61s -> 19956.73s]  sites around the cemetery so far nothing we'll keep looking but i don't think the source of
[19956.73s -> 19964.89s]  the poison is here don't worry about him he's just agitated with all the looks he's been getting
[19965.45s -> 19974.42s]  digging in a cemetery looks very suspicious okay bye thanks for confirming diarrhea anything else
[19975.67s -> 19982.07s]  okay now we have to go and confirm the person who gave us all diarrhea the source of the diarrhea
[19982.71s -> 19997.02s]  is in here uh lauren quick question do you wash the vegetables that you bring into the store

[20706.23s -> 20716.06s]  now she's gone missing so when they find her they'll really try to put her away may never gave an
[20716.06s -> 20721.26s]  alibi because she was protecting someone they both have they both have they both have lego hair

[20736.46s -> 20741.82s]  would she do that they used to be friends when they were younger but grew apart i guess they

[21514.60s -> 21520.52s]  the judge's son he's a real piece of work i think the judge probably agrees with you
[21520.52s -> 21526.36s]  i don't know him personally but i've heard stories he claims that during the time in which the accused
[21526.44s -> 21532.04s]  witch's evidence was stolen he was helping alicia cole i guess he does work for her
[21532.68s -> 21537.48s]  claimants against the hathorne estate they're trying to take control of the property as
[21537.48s -> 21543.00s]  reciprocity for their ancestors having that land and life stolen from them by the original judge
[21543.00s -> 21550.28s]  hathorne and that's valid according to the judge yes but back to jason sounds like he's short of
[21550.28s -> 21557.40s]  cash constantly but i see him driving a fancy car around town looks like he lives a pretty
[21557.40s -> 21563.40s]  comfortable lifestyle to me money is always a prime motivator he could be receiving money from
[21563.40s -> 21568.44s]  someone to commit one of these crimes or he could have a financial stake in the property
[21573.40s -> 21577.88s]  but if he was tied into the he keeps looking up for it when she starts talking i can only
[21577.88s -> 21585.00s]  imagine that it's through his father the judge is he on your list everyone is a suspect until
[21585.00s -> 21599.10s]  they aren't you taught me that right okay who else put it on your little list the queen and the

[24185.46s -> 24200.06s]  movies movies what's this old chest doing here what the hell do you have all this here for

[24225.98s -> 24234.76s]  slot on the top and the right how does that not go in there oh it's a circle circle
[24235.96s -> 24245.48s]  are there any circle slots that's a circle where are the circle slots square circle
[24246.12s -> 24253.21s]  there's that one all right now this one ain't square square square square i need
[24254.33s -> 24261.93s]  fuck no no get out of here get out out i need a triangle on the edge and there's only one
[24261.93s -> 24275.59s]  so it has to be this one do this edge first triangle on the left we are circle square
[24276.39s -> 24287.06s]  circle square circle square we don't have one oh shit uh-oh circle circle can i rotate them
[24288.02s -> 24320.71s]  you can rotate what the fuck are you doing put it away stop stop oh my god place where's my
[24320.71s -> 24328.92s]  circle where's my circle all right there's a lot for this who cares it's wrong it's wrong
[24328.92s -> 24338.94s]  now we need a square and then a slot we got a square and then a slot down here i think
[24339.02s -> 24344.30s]  no fucking dumbass and then we need a slot slot right there no we need plus
[24344.30s -> 24347.98s]  last one over this way that sounds good this way we're gonna have a triangle go into here
[24349.02s -> 24364.90s]  what is it i need a triangle slot are they not three where's the triangle slot
[24366.55s -> 24410.44s]  i'm fucking stupid fucking idiot fucking game fucking dumb i need shit shit do the edges first
[24410.44s -> 24420.22s]  like you said i know i know that's what i should have done i i'll get it okay edges first edges
[24420.22s -> 24443.14s]  first did you check total to the right did you check total to the left i need a slot i need a
[24444.34s -> 24447.38s]  arrow pointing that way and is this a arrow pointing that way and down
[24448.18s -> 24468.33s]  arrow pointing that way and down is it okay circle pointing right and one pointing down like this
[24468.33s -> 24478.15s]  right yeah okay i mean now i gotta do this at the bottom so i need a circle and i need to circle
[24478.15s -> 24484.55s]  just square square square square all around open squares by the way don't don't ever fuck that up
[24484.55s -> 24509.70s]  and circle by the way circle down there it is now got no oh shit and then this is a this one's up
[24509.70s -> 24515.22s]  and then right on this one maybe this way there's one that's all four this is probably right in the
[24515.22s -> 24532.20s]  middle somewhere i would say it's probably this one right here oh you bet your ass i just
[24532.20s -> 24553.50s]  did i get it shit i need to switch me now where's this one go i need a left right and then one out

[24583.64s -> 24594.82s]  deserve it neither did those people back in 1692 they were victims thanks they went we're just going
[24594.82s -> 24599.22s]  to leave her down there she can take care of herself is that what you told yourself when you
[24599.22s -> 24604.02s]  climbed down we left her down there what would have happened if we hadn't come along we have to
[24604.02s -> 24610.18s]  give this will to the judge by the end of the day otherwise this whole thing was for not and if we
[24610.18s -> 24615.22s]  leave her down there stuck in those tunnels much longer we'll have some actual deaths on our hands
[24615.22s -> 24620.66s]  and if we go down there it's going to be all of us that's all right we gave her we gave her plenty
[24620.66s -> 24625.78s]  of air why nancy's here we poked a few holes i got into this case was because i care about my cousin
[24625.78s -> 24633.14s]  okay but this is what we have to do believe me i don't want anything to happen to me or nancy
[24633.14s -> 24639.94s]  or nancy either fine i'm trying to do one right thing in this whole mess are we going to see the

[24646.18s -> 24652.98s]  office because that is what nancy would want me to do listen i may not always be her biggest fan
[24652.98s -> 24657.62s]  but if there's anything i know about her it's that she's going to get herself in may out of
[24657.62s -> 24662.66s]  the tunnel safely at least she's gonna come up with like a fire extinguisher and be pointing
[24662.66s -> 24669.93s]  it out it's like i'll do it your choice i hope this is a very a very large irritant that'll get
[24669.93s -> 24681.72s]  in your eyes where we're not gonna get jumped on escape the tunnels it's never happened before
[24682.84s -> 24692.74s]  why don't we just leave with them is there any other way out we don't know she's dead

[24723.59s -> 24729.19s]  tea fed to stop you would think at this point you'd stop drinking tea that people gave you

[24812.79s -> 24816.31s]  hear me but you you had the only person i could talk to and if you go back and play the whole
[24816.31s -> 24823.35s]  game through it's like wow that's right nobody ever did address her ever no one is going to die
[24823.35s -> 24828.23s]  please you're hurt i need you to calm down because you're the one who knows this place

[25751.50s -> 25760.97s]  thick layer of dust should wipe it clean first oh would you please why is everything so dusty
[25760.97s -> 25785.94s]  in this game it's dusty what the hell could it be the same height they're all going to be the same
[25785.94s -> 25843.56s]  height i get it this moves these two almost almost i feel like after you make like 60 nancy drew
[25843.56s -> 25850.33s]  games you just at at at 2019 you're just like i have no fucking idea what we're going to do
[25850.33s -> 25872.04s]  for puzzle number 492 that's right that's right that's right so what's what is this
[25873.61s -> 25906.97s]  wait what supposed to be mirroring this well i can't even pull this one up come down here
[25906.97s -> 25921.24s]  that's correct there this moves these two independently why didn't you just play the
[25921.24s -> 25949.54s]  older ones because this is the new one and i had to painfully cause myself pain first click on the
[25949.54s -> 25962.17s]  left side i can't i can only manipulate the right side they have to be in a row like that but wait
[25962.17s -> 25977.96s]  there's like this two on here though one of them's try dusting it is am i actually supposed to be
[25978.12s -> 25987.13s]  i have to be i have to be mirroring this i'm bringing this down to here go like that
[25999.08s -> 26021.38s]  this needs to come up this comes up and then this goes up oh you motherfucker you're right here this
[26021.38s -> 26040.14s]  comes up no put these up too i can't go up any higher that was not even accurate what i was
[26040.14s -> 26068.73s]  trying to do i wasn't even trying to do that so there's some please be a door you actually
[26068.73s -> 26088.02s]  did it let's get out of here now where the fuck are we did you take you three tries to open the

[26098.57s -> 26106.97s]  the will no need to recap let's go nancy are you all right dear dra can you frank and joe
[26106.97s -> 26115.45s]  wait in the hallway bugleberry he's got the reverb now my pleasure judge we need to talk
[26115.45s -> 26123.53s]  what i hope he leans into his light and goes yes it looks like it is it a confession maybe judge
[26123.53s -> 26130.49s]  we've been here all night i think it's time we retire you're not going anywhere perp excuse me
[26131.13s -> 26137.14s]  your honor it's become clear to us that miss cole has been the perpetrator of numerous crimes
[26137.14s -> 26146.82s]  here in salem including attempted murder murder judge please that's a very serious claim nancy
[26147.54s -> 26154.10s]  and this is a serious case people's lives hang in the balance this is very cute and all but
[26154.10s -> 26158.90s]  we have to do adult things now so run along everyone before your pb and jays get cold
[26159.46s -> 26166.76s]  i have proof it's all related to the hathorn house the future of which rests in your hands
[26166.76s -> 26173.64s]  so i think you should hear me don't i want to see the end wait show me the end what you can't be
[26173.64s -> 26178.60s]  serious judge this is clearly a half-brained attempt to delay what we have determined to be
[26178.60s -> 26183.80s]  a sound judgment that the half-born house should revert to the state we have spent most of this
[26183.80s -> 26188.28s]  evening going over all possibilities for how to decide the rightful owner of this house
[26188.84s -> 26194.04s]  and you've been very adamant that the state should handle it but we should probably on rush any
[26194.04s -> 26202.12s]  evidence to add i'm willing to hear her out unbelievable well you see alicia's been poisoning
[26202.84s -> 26210.68s]  lauren hult water supply alicia has been poisoning lauren hult water why is it so echoey in here
[26211.48s -> 26217.32s]  that's just too much after interviewing lauren hult and experiencing some negative it's so
[26217.32s -> 26223.06s]  echoey drinking her water i discovered are we underwater had been tainting her water supply
[26223.14s -> 26228.42s]  with ergot well that would explain my client's erratic behavior over the past few weeks
[26229.30s -> 26236.10s]  she lost her mother months ago and that woman wasn't it was raining give me a break
[26236.10s -> 26242.18s]  it was raining outside that ergot causes echo inside of your house you said she was poisoned
[26242.18s -> 26248.18s]  wouldn't that affect anyone's behavior what exactly are you insinuating that you know how ergot
[26248.26s -> 26254.02s]  affects its victims i'm not answering these questions i happen to be well versed in biology
[26254.02s -> 26260.34s]  all right but any tidbit of knowledge i have you'll just try to trap me with it use it against me
[26260.90s -> 26268.34s]  i don't need to do that because i found in your office a map of the hathorne house so i was i
[26268.34s -> 26276.98s]  brought what i was here miss drew your coat looks pretty soaked and muddy shoes water is wet and
[26276.98s -> 26282.50s]  it's raining outside are you satisfied with the ridiculousness of this yet how much longer are
[26282.50s -> 26289.70s]  you gonna let this go on it all does seem circumstantial is that all you have can i
[26289.70s -> 26301.64s]  refund no i can't you can't play an entire game and then refund it it's almost eight hours of this
[26301.64s -> 26309.61s]  oh yeah i just gotta say i'll just steam refund i've i've i've i've done everything i've beaten the
[26309.61s -> 26327.51s]  game you can't you can't go to a movie watch the movie and after the movie's over you sit through
[26327.51s -> 26332.71s]  the credits you even watch the last extra end of credits scene after the credits and you get a
[26332.71s -> 26343.74s]  refund hey i didn't like that movie i want my refund can you do that no you can't you can't
[26343.74s -> 26358.30s]  do that it's final sale if you're annoying enough you can you can't watch a full movie and then
[26358.30s -> 26374.82s]  leave and be like that movie's i didn't like that movie i want my money back just finish it just
[26374.82s -> 26381.02s]  finish the game finish the game finish the game just finish the movie don't walk out of the theater
[26381.02s -> 26384.82s]  by the way you walk out of the theater now you don't get a refund you gotta see the whole thing
[26385.46s -> 26421.27s]  i just ran 60 seconds of ads are you seeing them nobody's seeing these there's 32 seconds
[26421.27s -> 26431.70s]  remaining no one's seeing ads imagine if ads appeared in the movie holy shit no one would
[26431.70s -> 26452.46s]  ever go to the movies can you fuck can you imagine this universe is finite its resource is finite
[26452.46s -> 26459.66s]  what i'm doing it requires back lobster fest is on at red lobster with the most lobster dishes
[26460.38s -> 26465.02s]  what do you choose how about lobster lovers dream more like a lobster dream come true
[26465.02s -> 26472.39s]  a butter poached maintail roasted rock all right let's end the game did anyone actually see an ad
[26478.70s -> 26490.76s]  no one saw an ad alicia was responsible for stealing aw evidence yes and i also paid 250
[26492.52s -> 26498.44s]  oh that actually hurt i spoke with your son jason he claims alicia forced him i'm sorry
[26498.60s -> 26505.00s]  is a grown man his actions are his own alicia lent jason her car then jason broke into the
[26505.00s -> 26511.80s]  evidence room and stole the files i have proof on cctv so what it actually sounds like
[26520.92s -> 26527.88s]  he runs errands for me all the time and how did he have access to the evidence room
[26528.60s -> 26535.08s]  only you and the judge had the code look you made 250 dollars for this movie and then you got an ad
[26536.28s -> 26542.92s]  probably apologies judge but your carelessness is the reason this happened in all probability
[26542.92s -> 26549.13s]  jason and i've been talking over the whole movie the movie was eight hours i doubt that he barely
[26549.13s -> 26554.25s]  spends any time this is i have been speaking over the entire movie you left it out for anyone to
[26554.25s -> 26559.13s]  see if he didn't know the door was unlocked how hard would it have been to find your key
[26560.89s -> 26568.17s]  miss cold that's enough anything else miss true yes alicia was behind the theft of the book of
[26568.17s -> 26574.09s]  apologies alicia was behind i've never been to europe how did you lie passport i heard the
[26574.09s -> 26580.09s]  judge talking to you about i never said that's not strange plane tickets in jason's car he admitted
[26580.09s -> 26587.45s]  to stealing the book of apologies on alicia cole's order order how did i order little jason
[26587.45s -> 26592.41s]  because you like when he cleans your pool or something right she likes to watch him
[26592.41s -> 26598.23s]  cleaner pool i don't really know to be honest with you i know he's always looking for money
[26598.87s -> 26609.00s]  he's in debt badly a fact alicia uses to her advantage oh this is absurd how did he buy a
[26609.00s -> 26614.84s]  first class round trip ticket to salzberg when the crime occurred because i pay him for doing
[26614.84s -> 26619.08s]  errands for me why is she reading this money however as if she's reading shit off of a bingo
[26619.08s -> 26625.56s]  card in a giant auditorium i don't know how we could prove that all the airline you can use the
[26625.56s -> 26630.68s]  plane ticket reference number call the airline they should be able to check the payment i bet
[26630.68s -> 26635.16s]  you it was paid by alicia cole credit card there's no way jason would have that much cash to buy a
[26635.16s -> 26642.92s]  first class ticket he obviously stole my credit card so you admit that your card was used to make
[26642.92s -> 26648.36s]  the purchase where are the police i didn't say that where are the police there's been no police
[26648.36s -> 26653.64s]  at all that he stole it the credit card company would have notified you for making a large
[26653.64s -> 26659.64s]  there's no there's nothing here how large is this is this room being recorded thousands of dollars
[26660.36s -> 26669.24s]  hmm miss cole if this is a court of law and the police were asking for probable cause
[26669.24s -> 26676.76s]  i'd be hard pressed not to allow it do you have anything to say i told him to get those tickets
[26677.40s -> 26683.88s]  you know your honor your son is a real idiot truly a world-class moron he couldn't even follow
[26683.88s -> 26690.28s]  simple instructions i would have had better luck writing them in crayon and this seriously this
[26690.28s -> 26696.04s]  is the kind of stuff i have to deal with i went to law school i have three degrees and now i have
[26696.68s -> 26707.75s]  an arsonist two ghost hunters a wannabe detective and her assistant hey what no trying to screw up
[26707.75s -> 26714.31s]  my plans all the people you pointed out didn't even have to take a mask off no the reason i
[26714.31s -> 26721.43s]  am going down is that this stupid little town is stuck in the past oh my great great great
[26721.43s -> 26728.15s]  great grandmother was accused as a witch i want repayment because i'm lazy she loved me so much
[26728.15s -> 26734.07s]  that i want this disgusting ruin of a house for free so i can run my luminous vegan tea grocery
[26734.07s -> 26740.79s]  store that is what pathetic looks like a bunch of whining moaning little people whose worldview
[26740.79s -> 26749.19s]  is infinitesimally small why alicia i just told you i just went over it to do something for this
[26749.19s -> 26754.55s]  town i care about salem more sorry i wasn't listening to anything teagans and lauren's
[26754.55s -> 26760.39s]  combined i care the most i was locked inside my own head leveled that old house a long time ago
[26760.39s -> 26766.47s]  and built new houses with all that land we could have a real community here we could bring in new
[26766.55s -> 26772.31s]  business that isn't completely relying on stupid scary stuff i am talking about economic development
[26772.31s -> 26777.91s]  on a level which salem has never even seen and who would be the owner of these new houses
[26786.60s -> 26812.14s]  hold that thought for a second okay the um looking at the economic outlook for salem to see if she
[26812.14s -> 26830.63s]  was right so there has been a 3.2 growth in payroll growth general fund okay current revenue growth
[26830.63s -> 26835.35s]  does not keep pace with the growth and current operations costs growth and property tax revenue
[26835.35s -> 26838.71s]  year over year ranges between three and a half percent and three percent still below historical
[26838.71s -> 26845.51s]  levels of 5.5 percent lower than predicted compression losses beginning in 2014-2005 are
[26845.51s -> 26851.75s]  expected to continue which improves the city's forecast for essential resource for years two
[26851.75s -> 26857.03s]  through five of the forecast uh per s rates are assumed to exceed the current advisory board's
[26857.03s -> 26873.85s]  recommendations hmm okay here it is forecast the general fund what 134 dollars that's not right
[26874.87s -> 26882.23s]  beginning working capital current year revenues beginning working capital 21 dollars and 98 cents
[26882.79s -> 26890.23s]  current year revenue 112 dollars total resource 134 dollars that's not this is am i is this like
[26890.23s -> 26899.08s]  a different thing is that supposed to be million i think it's million yeah value in millions by
[26899.08s -> 26912.41s]  the way value in millions 134 million in revenue by the way 2018 to 2019 136 million dollars in
[26912.41s -> 26927.82s]  revenue so estimated uh estimated ending working capital is 15.4 million dollars well after knowing
[26927.82s -> 26932.30s]  this case inside out it wouldn't be hard for me to get the land out of the grasp of the state
[26932.86s -> 26939.02s]  after all i've done for this community some recompense is in order so you're saying you
[26939.02s -> 26947.22s]  poisoned lauren so you could build and own a housing complex it's always a housing complex
[26948.26s -> 26952.26s]  and give me you were gonna level the national park to put in condos
[26953.30s -> 26958.90s]  money in real estate you know you have no idea how much money i would have made with condos
[26958.90s -> 26963.78s]  there is absolutely no way you could control it's always condos in apartments you could have done
[26963.78s -> 26971.06s]  irreparable damage so fuck that tree fuck that big tree it's been 100 years i don't care i've lived
[26971.06s -> 26979.78s]  for 100 years this town needs me no it doesn't i already have the papers and i am taking them
[26979.78s -> 26985.70s]  to the state office and none of you are going to stop me you can't cut down that tree yes i can
[26985.70s -> 27001.85s]  and there'll be big expensive condos it's an average price of a condo in salem massachusetts
[27008.55s -> 27010.71s]  so you admit to all of it yes
[27015.19s -> 27020.10s]  oh there's other people in the room fuck i didn't even see them for them to arrive
[27020.10s -> 27029.13s]  this is unbelievable only wanted to make salem this is really disturbing i am shocked
[27029.77s -> 27035.21s]  very shocked at what has occurred here miss cole will be held accountable for her crimes
[27035.21s -> 27042.73s]  i will make sure of it but as much as it pains me to admit she is right we do not have a legal heir
[27043.61s -> 27054.38s]  yes we do we found the will we found francis tuttle's will and according to her lauren halt
[27054.38s -> 27059.98s]  is the sole heir of the hathorne house estate i believe the will supersedes all other claims
[27059.98s -> 27066.14s]  to the property unfortunately the accused witch's organization has no evidence that says they have
[27066.14s -> 27073.74s]  any claim on the property it is what it is okay well what about the hathorne house hog champ
[27073.74s -> 27080.86s]  legal air twist three messages down resident sleeper had nothing to do with the fire you're
[27080.86s -> 27087.34s]  sure how do you know because i have a confession from the person who did really
[27087.74s -> 27097.24s]  me teagan perry intentionally set the fire to force out lauren and let the aw organization
[27097.24s -> 27104.04s]  take over the property that's surprising you say it was intentional yes i believe it was
[27104.04s -> 27109.24s]  and i believe that because anything less than intentional would mean people conspired to
[27109.24s -> 27114.44s]  withhold information about who was responsible and who might that be you should just play the ace
[27114.52s -> 27120.68s]  attorney i couldn't say it doesn't matter who knew what it doesn't matter it doesn't matter
[27120.68s -> 27127.56s]  then she will also be held responsible for judge did you ever interview may get a statement well
[27127.56s -> 27134.04s]  so you just assumed she was guilty of the crime a case needed to be built there was no case because
[27134.04s -> 27139.72s]  you never miss true i asked that in this office you treat me with respect you deserve as much
[27139.72s -> 27145.48s]  respect as i'm currently giving you judge nancy maybe we should you made this poor girl's life a
[27145.48s -> 27150.76s]  living nightmare because of something she did when she was young she was a kid your honor
[27150.76s -> 27156.52s]  her entire life we're not in a courtroom you know the lawyer in a courtroom can you imagine
[27156.52s -> 27162.68s]  there's no jury here can you imagine what that does to her family to her well that is a bit
[27162.76s -> 27168.84s]  unfair you know this town has a history of judges not guilty sound jurisprudence
[27168.84s -> 27173.88s]  thanks for coming nancy tell your father i said hi you would be able to write that wrong
[27175.64s -> 27182.44s]  perhaps but my concerns are not unfounded you think jason is a screw-up now what would have
[27182.44s -> 27189.00s]  happened if he had been friends with her he is friends with her judge what how is that possible
[27189.64s -> 27195.72s]  i i thought at least i would know a judge is supposed to judge people on their actions alone
[27196.28s -> 27201.88s]  not the people they call their friends i just hope you remember that when you sentence jason
[27201.88s -> 27206.36s]  because his crimes aren't imagined does it be a real better audio book they deserve
[27206.36s -> 27218.62s]  real punishment just take away the puzzles and make it audio only i did it say goodbye
[27221.08s -> 27229.00s]  fuck these people i just wanted to say i'm sorry for what we always promised that a secret was
[27229.00s -> 27236.12s]  the most important thing in the world and we would never break it and i did you saved my life
[27237.24s -> 27248.47s]  nancy hadn't found me well why is my such a blurred vision for a while you screwed up still i know
[27248.47s -> 27252.95s]  who you are there's a good person hidden below this pretty boy exterior

[27411.88s -> 27417.88s]  and i have to say someone with your magical insights clairvoyance even would make a great fit

[28176.58s -> 28194.71s]  like that i'm right in the middle but slightly angry about it uh in the pain index yeah i know
[28194.71s -> 28203.24s]  but the thing about ace attorney is ace attorney ace attorney is just i i the ace attorney is not
[28203.24s -> 28208.68s]  like a crappy game this grabbed me and i think a lot of other people in the first two three hours
[28208.68s -> 28217.66s]  because it was it was a little crusty plus ace attorney does this thing and i know it's it's a
[28217.66s -> 28222.94s]  thing that it's just a thing that i don't like about it it's the thing that i don't even know
[28222.94s -> 28234.66s]  if you can turn it off i've tried the game flashes you act with white flashing every 10 seconds it's
[28234.66s -> 28243.62s]  like that was all the time there is this white camera flash that does the whole screen
[28244.58s -> 28259.38s]  and you can't turn it off and it actually kind of bothers me you're afraid of the light why didn't
[28259.38s -> 28263.62s]  you tell us sooner well i i told you that i've just i didn't think i wanted to stream it
[28264.92s -> 28272.71s]  and also that's like that's like just don't look just blink when those flashes happen put on
[28272.71s -> 28285.59s]  sunglasses we would have understood no i brought this up before i i definitely brought this i
[28285.59s -> 28291.93s]  remember talking about this how i was hoping that when the the new remastered version came out that
[28291.93s -> 28307.56s]  you could turn it off and i don't think it did i remember yes nancy drew is more germa's speed
[28308.36s -> 28312.36s]  uh are you sure about that because i think for at least three or four of the major puzzles in
[28312.36s -> 28324.98s]  the game i just looked it up on the guide or asked you what the answer was but uh thank you
[28324.98s -> 28329.94s]  wild hubbutty for the 500 bits thank you for letting me be the germa one guy with that great

[28338.86s -> 28357.66s]  sometimes i'm proven wrong happens a lot thanks to the 500 bits a lot of times you've proven
[28357.66s -> 28371.90s]  wrong ban that person for life it was cad oh still do it hey abomination zero thanks to the
[28371.90s -> 28383.78s]  420 bits why isn't this week canon um well the first stream was not canon because joel and i
[28383.78s -> 28391.06s]  had some scheduling conflicts we were going to play halo reach on uh the first stream of this
[28391.06s -> 28396.36s]  week was supposed to be halo reach and then i mean joel talked and there was some stuff uh he was
[28396.36s -> 28399.40s]  busy with some stuff and we were like you know what fuck we'll just do it the next day so that
[28399.40s -> 28404.17s]  was the first strain that was just like whatever this is i'm just gonna stream because like i still
[28404.17s -> 28408.97s]  plan to stream i was gonna do but this is non-canon stream the next day um me and joel did play halo
[28408.97s -> 28415.69s]  reach but it was a disaster uh it was an absolute 100% completely unmitigated disaster uh so that
[28415.69s -> 28420.25s]  was not canon because it was uh all over the place uh so i figured okay that's two streams in a row
[28420.25s -> 28425.13s]  that would just sort of just literally throwing up dice in the air uh so we'll just keep the whole
[28425.13s -> 28436.25s]  the whole week is non-canon it was very good oh let me do not mistake this these last three streams

[28442.82s -> 28450.79s]  they're canon streams i think it's still best you can have fun in non-canon streams was simpsons hit
[28450.79s -> 28458.68s]  and run canon yeah you know no no no no no you know sometimes like you do there'll be a piece
[28458.68s -> 28465.54s]  of media that's created and then they make it canon retroactively the nancy drew stream is canon
[28466.79s -> 28485.32s]  yeah yes no yes it is yes it it absolutely is it's happened in the past i can retroactively
[28485.32s -> 28493.62s]  i can make it canon if i want but thank you abomination thanks for the 420 bits thank you

[28826.94s -> 28835.67s]  been subbed for the first time today from a community sub welcome hopefully not very many
[28835.67s -> 28844.62s]  of you got cut off from the crash that happened earlier because remember we play in the game for
[28844.62s -> 28851.18s]  about 30 40 minutes and then the stream turned off so sorry to those of you in the first 20 30
[28851.18s -> 28859.85s]  minutes of the stream that may have gotten cut off thank you everybody again for your ridiculous
[28859.85s -> 28874.36s]  generosity and support of this live stream how's your razor mouse germa uh it's not good it's not
[28874.36s -> 28885.24s]  good i don't like it but again thank you seriously seriously seriously seriously there's still some
[28885.24s -> 28894.04s]  more bits to do thank you mostly lost for the 250 hey jimbo any hey jimbo any updates on that
[28894.04s -> 28898.20s]  community meetup in vegas or is that just another thing we can throw under the pile of things that
[28898.20s -> 28913.61s]  you lied about jimbo um i mean you you can add it to the list you can add it to the list i
[28914.17s -> 28926.10s]  i want to do i would love to do that but i it costs money and i've like i i i keep spending money
[28926.90s -> 28939.37s]  on other things for the stream so not now not yet so that i i think like having a big private
[28939.37s -> 28952.55s]  like party is is uh it might cost more than i think he spent that money on nancy drew
[28964.46s -> 28971.50s]  that's true that i some of your bits have gone to me purchasing nancy drew
[28977.14s -> 28992.47s]  uh that was an investment i very much resent that all right i just said that but people
[28992.47s -> 29000.84s]  people make like me me jokes about oh oh he if i told you that i spent 50 dollars of your bit
[29000.84s -> 29007.08s]  money at the roulette table people would be like oh gambling what the fuck oh he's gonna be rolling
[29007.56s -> 29015.45s]  that but that's but that's better than me buying the nancy drew bundle are you sure
[29022.26s -> 29036.33s]  i wouldn't mind it to be honest you didn't waste money how is gambling not wasting money gambling
[29036.33s -> 29042.33s]  money is wasting money with the hope that one of the times that you're actively wasting the money
[29042.33s -> 29058.07s]  that you'll get some money given back to you if you lose confirmed nancy drew complete bundle worse
[29058.15s -> 29082.55s]  than going to a casino confirmed anyways all jokes aside we'll see you tomorrow whatever uh
[29083.35s -> 29094.38s]  happens tomorrow i'll be live making some of that sweet sweet non-canon but finally
[29095.66s -> 29102.78s]  we had actually two or three more came in uh siku thank you siku for the thousand bits less than
[29102.78s -> 29112.50s]  five minutes ago i still keep rewatching your old videos they've gold that means a lot uh because
[29114.18s -> 29122.20s]  90 of every video i made on youtube was designed in a way that i would want people to be able to
[29122.20s -> 29131.13s]  watch them more than once and maybe still think they're worth watching i that's was that's part
[29131.13s -> 29135.93s]  of the reason why i made some of those videos was i want you to be able to watch them again maybe
[29135.93s -> 29143.32s]  come back and watch them again if you thought they were funny maybe miss maybe you missed an
[29143.32s -> 29147.96s]  easter egg that you caught this time maybe you have to go back and watch the whole thing check
[29147.96s -> 29156.58s]  out the easter egg there was at least two or three easter eggs in each video no that's not
[29156.58s -> 29159.06s]  that's not that's not i know people are gonna be like what the fuck and they're gonna go back
[29159.94s -> 29176.30s]  that's not true some of them maybe acting acting like you designed the videos i did i sat there
[29177.26s -> 29187.30s]  for weeks at a time sometimes on some of those videos people always wonder why did you only make
[29187.30s -> 29191.94s]  a video like once every like four or five days i was sitting there in the editing room with the
[29191.94s -> 29198.23s]  lights off just trying what what do i want here what do i want to do is it i do is that fun
[29198.23s -> 29203.35s]  that's i think that's really funny i like this it's fun and then you go back and you listen you
[29203.35s -> 29210.34s]  watch the same part of the video like four 10 20 times in a row and then when i'm talking about
[29210.34s -> 29214.58s]  i'm talking about like like a five second segment that you watch like 50 times in a row
[29215.30s -> 29226.46s]  ridiculous not every single video was like that but most of them were the developing room skipping
[29226.46s -> 29241.00s]  each frame of film from your camera in front of your projector that's right the the old way
[29241.96s -> 29249.43s]  that's true but yes uh i'm happy that you still like them because that's another part of the
[29249.75s -> 29258.62s]  fear of making videos or making any kind of content is is if people can go back five plus
[29258.62s -> 29266.23s]  almost seven eight plus years ago like if somebody comes back and watches these videos is this still
[29266.23s -> 29280.09s]  going to be will does it stand up i don't know hopefully it does it's part of the thought
[29280.09s -> 29288.34s]  process i guess but uh thank you cq and thank you cq again for another 500 bits
[29290.60s -> 29313.90s]  say for the nancy drew fund by every nancy drew game see you tomorrow have a wonderful night
[29314.84s -> 29330.95s]  nancy drew the newest we're going newest and then down to oldest good night guys let's see you tomorrow
