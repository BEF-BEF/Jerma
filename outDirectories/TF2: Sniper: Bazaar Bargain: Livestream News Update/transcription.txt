[0.31s -> 13.39s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[13.39s -> 18.89s]  Gonna be playing as the sniper tonight with the Bizarre Bargain, which I don't know why I used this thing.
[18.89s -> 24.89s]  To be totally honest, I should not be equipping this thing at all. I just like the way it looks and I like the way it sounds.
[24.89s -> 32.39s]  So, regardless of all of that, I'm using the Bizarre Bargain, the Razorback, and the default Kukri.
[32.39s -> 38.39s]  And the reason why I have the Razorback on is I know that the Razorback is not the best option.
[38.39s -> 43.39s]  I know that you should just put on the Jurati or put on the Danger Shield. I usually have the Danger Shield on.
[43.39s -> 50.39s]  But I have this on because for some reason, when you put this on, this is just like going under the covers when you were 5 years old.
[50.39s -> 55.39s]  Ducking your head under the covers and sleeping that way to protect yourself from monsters.
[55.39s -> 61.13s]  Now, as we all know, if a monster did come into the room, he would rip the covers off and just kill you.
[61.13s -> 66.63s]  And that's kind of the same theory with the Razorback. It just makes me feel more comfortable.
[66.63s -> 71.43s]  It makes me feel like I'm protected when I'm really not. But that's why I have it on.
[71.43s -> 76.43s]  This is also on King of the Hill Lakeside, which is one of the best sniper maps in the game.
[76.43s -> 80.43s]  Because it really is just built for snipers. There's a little roost over here.
[80.43s -> 83.93s]  There's a spot over on the left that has a wall to protect you.
[83.93s -> 90.43s]  There's a spot down below. There's plenty of spots for snipers and that's why everybody plays sniper on this map.
[90.43s -> 96.43s]  This is a great sniper. This is a great spy map, which is the reason why it can get sort of crazy on this map.
[96.43s -> 103.43s]  If you hold down tab and look at the scoreboard and you go, why are there seven snipers on this game right now?
[103.43s -> 108.43s]  Well, that's the reason, because it's a map that's catered to snipers, I guess.
[108.43s -> 113.99s]  So what I want to talk about in this gameplay, I want to talk about something very, very, very important.
[113.99s -> 121.79s]  It's about live streaming. I just got the ability to live stream on YouTube through Machinima.
[121.79s -> 128.79s]  I have a Machinima contract that lets me do it now. And I want to start to transition from Twitch over to YouTube.
[128.79s -> 134.79s]  Now, I'm not just going to stop doing my Twitch TV stuff. I'm not going to turn that off and be like, okay, that's it.
[134.79s -> 137.79s]  No more Saturday, six o'clock streams. No, that's still going to be there.
[137.79s -> 142.79s]  Every Saturday at six p.m. Eastern Standard Time, I'm going to live stream on Twitch.
[142.79s -> 148.40s]  Regardless of all of this new YouTube live streaming stuff. So don't be worried about that at all.
[148.40s -> 152.40s]  That's going to keep going. I'm going to keep that going for a long time.
[152.40s -> 159.64s]  I just wanted to give you guys a heads up that I'm going to start doing random YouTube streams to try and get the feel for it.
[159.64s -> 164.64s]  Try to get into the YouTube scene for streaming, because I don't want anyone to be taken off guard by this.
[164.64s -> 171.64s]  I don't want someone to see in their feed that I'm streaming on YouTube and have them be like, what is going on right now?
[171.64s -> 176.94s]  What? So look out for that in the next couple of weeks. I'm not going to do it so soon.
[176.94s -> 181.44s]  I want to make sure I do it right when I do it. So be on the lookout for that.
[181.44s -> 186.44s]  So now I have a question for you guys. Has to do with Team Fortress 2, has to do with snipers.
[186.44s -> 195.44s]  So it's in a perfect video, right? So the question is, what is your favorite sniper rifle and where is your favorite spot on any map?
[195.44s -> 199.44s]  Because I'm trying to find some new places to snipe, not just on Lakeside.
[199.44s -> 203.44s]  I'm talking Gold Rush. I'm talking Badwater. I'm talking everything in general.
[203.44s -> 208.62s]  So I'll give you an example. I'll start off. Ready? My favorite sniper rifle is the Bizarre Bargain.
[208.62s -> 216.05s]  I don't know why. It just is. And my favorite sniping map slash spot is Badwater.
[216.05s -> 221.05s]  And it's that spot right when people come around that corner for the first card when you're on defense.
[221.05s -> 227.05s]  So if I'm on defense and I'm a sniper, the spot where right where people come around that first corner there on offense.
[227.05s -> 234.05s]  I love that spot. Just shooting down that tunnel. You get so many kills because so many people are stuffed in that one little area.
[234.05s -> 239.29s]  So that's what I mean for an example because I'm trying to find some new spots and trying to find some new fun ways to play sniper.
[239.29s -> 243.72s]  So let's start talking about the gameplay right now. Nice headshot on that spy coming out here.
[243.72s -> 249.72s]  I don't know why I decided to do this. This is not really advisable. I don't get myself killed or anything.
[249.72s -> 256.72s]  But I don't know why I decided to come all the way over to the point. I told myself I wanted to get a better view, a better look.
[256.72s -> 262.72s]  I wanted to be able to shoot downward at people. But this is not really recommended at all.
[262.72s -> 268.15s]  Trying to get the shot on that medic with the crossbow because he is aiming for me and I am scared.
[268.15s -> 273.15s]  And now the soldier medic pair comes up here. I smarten up now. I turn around, go back to my roost.
[273.15s -> 277.15s]  Not going to screw around anymore. Let's end this the right way, right?
[277.15s -> 283.15s]  But now I see there's a sniper in the way so I decide I'm not going to stand here. Two snipers in the same spot. That is not a good idea.
[283.15s -> 287.39s]  So I make my way up here. I'm going to go, whoa, wait a minute, four people on the point right now.
[287.39s -> 292.39s]  I just barely caught myself. I would have been killed instantly if I had walked up there.
[292.39s -> 296.57s]  So I come through the left pool room, as a friend of mine likes to call it.
[296.57s -> 300.74s]  Just trying to kitty corner myself so I can aim through that hole there.
[300.74s -> 305.92s]  Doesn't really work out so well so I end up turning around going towards their spawn area.
[305.92s -> 309.92s]  And I hang back here. I get a spy. Spy comes after me. I club him in the face.
[309.92s -> 312.92s]  And then I get a nice headshot on this sniper coming up here.
[312.92s -> 315.92s]  And that's going to be all she wrote. We win the game, guys.
[315.92s -> 319.10s]  Thank you so much for watching, everybody. I really do appreciate it.
[319.10s -> 324.10s]  And be on the lookout for my YouTube live streams. I have no idea when they're going to start.
[324.10s -> 328.34s]  But they're going to start soon. So I will see you guys all next time.
[328.34s -> 331.34s]  Take care, everybody.
