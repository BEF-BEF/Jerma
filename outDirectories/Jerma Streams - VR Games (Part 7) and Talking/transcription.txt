[0.18s -> 8.47s]  You ordering Chinese food? All right, you ready? I got it, I got it. You want me to tell you what
[8.47s -> 28.55s]  I want? Here we go. Crab rangoons. Spare ribs. Noodle. That's it. All right, let's open Elven
[28.55s -> 36.25s]  Assassin. Stop killing time here. I feel like it's been a majority of this stream. Sorry for
[36.25s -> 44.60s]  everybody that wanted some more VR for Mind Show. It's kind of hard to work with sometimes. So I
[44.60s -> 51.85s]  know a lot of people may have left. Uh, I'm sorry. Just do what I can, right? That's all I can do.
[52.41s -> 69.11s]  Elven Assassin. Let's try it. Spare ribs. Oh yeah, the spare ribs are the best. Elven Assassin.
[69.67s -> 80.82s]  This is an early game. I'm sure it is. Hey, but thanks for sticking it out. I say that a lot, but
[81.38s -> 84.42s]  you know sometimes you come across shit that you didn't know existed in the first place, so
[85.22s -> 94.60s]  appreciate the support. Let's go. I'm ready. This is an early access, so some things will
[94.60s -> 102.04s]  improve along the way if you find any issues. All right, well this is wrong again. Jeremy.
[102.84s -> 124.98s]  Uh, I gotta change this from Mind Show to Elven Assassin, unfortunately. ABCD.
[127.62s -> 137.61s]  I like cringed people out of the channel. Archery platforms don't match your play area. It should
[137.61s -> 147.62s]  be not be used to play. Okay, whatever. Single player is fine. RPG, I guess. What the fuck is
[147.62s -> 157.54s]  happening here? No, the same shit that happens every time you play VR. What was that one? Oh,
[157.62s -> 164.26s]  I put it in the chat. Oh, you did? Oh, wait. Okay, ready? Graduate goon. Okay. Spare ribs.
[164.26s -> 170.02s]  Okay. And some kind of noodle. Like mulling? Yeah. Okay. All right, sorry about that. No,
[170.02s -> 176.04s]  it's all right. It's all good. You're good. You're good. It's all good. And some kind of noodle.
[176.76s -> 193.62s]  That was Kim. Virtual reality. Hey, pay fucking $299 to not have this happen. God damn
[193.62s -> 227.64s]  consumerists. Uh, defend the Elven town. Sure. Get the fuck off me. This is pretty. How do I play?
[228.28s -> 253.32s]  I, I don't know how to play. Okay. All right. Ah, shit. I'm not good. Not good.
[256.66s -> 297.37s]  Fuck. All right, got it. Wave three. All right. I win. Wave survived. Wave four.
[298.17s -> 347.86s]  What? Somebody climb it up here. Breaking in. What? What happened? Oh, my face. God damn it.
[347.86s -> 387.26s]  I'm gonna break my VR. Oh, fuck. Breaking in. Whatever. He'll be fine. He's slow. Just
[387.26s -> 449.35s]  go around him in a circle with a rope. This is just mind show. They're breaking in. Come on.
[455.16s -> 494.55s]  All right. I've got it. I'm good. I'm good. Oh, that was good. Good. Breaking in.
[497.21s -> 525.43s]  Full of fire. Is this the whole game? Breaking in.
[528.30s -> 554.12s]  Shit. Who's left? Who's even left? Can I go over there? Oh, I'm so good at video games. You have
[554.12s -> 562.46s]  no idea. Watch this. Watch this one. Just fucking feast your eyes on this shit. Just zoom in on this.
[563.72s -> 577.58s]  Just fucking download that. Download this one. Breaking in. This giant jacket is killing me.
[577.58s -> 640.60s]  I'm not fucking this one up. Oh, you dick. Right in the head. Come on. Come on. Breaking in.
[643.75s -> 675.77s]  Oh, thank God. Right in the head. Come on. Really? Game's kind of good.
[680.04s -> 686.30s]  All right. Let's summon Jax for this one. Ready?
[753.54s -> 784.25s]  Fuck. Come on. This stupid giant.
[809.94s -> 831.42s]  All right. I'm done. I'm done with this one. I'm done. We're moving on.
[832.06s -> 840.39s]  This is fun. This is fun to do this. God damn it. I'm done. I'm off. Get me out of here.
[841.11s -> 874.84s]  Not anymore. We're done. Breaking in. Oh, I got it. Not yet. Not yet. Horror game? No,
[874.84s -> 903.67s]  not right now. You don't really... Horror? Ugh. Fine. Let's do Dreadhalls. Can I beat the game?
[903.67s -> 928.20s]  We'll find out. Jerma lied about Minecraft VR 5 community stuff. I didn't lie. I did do it.
[928.20s -> 934.02s]  All right. So the title of the stream is Improv Acting Workshop. And we're going back into
[934.02s -> 957.77s]  Dreadhalls. I feel like the title can stay. Let's get it open. You ready for some acting?
[957.77s -> 973.50s]  Are we doing sweat? Eh. It's okay. Uh, where is it? What the hell is going on?
[973.50s -> 987.77s]  Show sweaty. There you go. See how red I am. VR takes a lot out of you guys. It really does.
[987.77s -> 997.62s]  Where is my... God computers. Don't fucking buy them. All right. I've had a few drinks.
[997.62s -> 1011.03s]  We can go into Dreadhalls. See if I can beat it. I'll give it a try. I will. Solid attempt.
[1022.09s -> 1030.98s]  I'm in the last section of the game. I should be able to do it. Let's get some courage here.
[1030.98s -> 1048.70s]  Dr. Steen 5 community subs. Thank you. I'm going to wake up tomorrow.
[1052.28s -> 1071.18s]  All this hair off. It's too fucking expensive. All right. Dreadhalls. I'm not afraid of no ghosts.
[1071.18s -> 1084.39s]  Let's fucking do it. Oh, it's so scary. Oh, two headphones in this time. We're almost at the end
[1084.39s -> 1098.62s]  of this game. I'm going to beat it tonight. Two headphones. Let's go. Oh, it's so scary.
[1098.78s -> 1107.00s]  Fucking horror games. Shut the fuck up. How do you move? I forget the controls, but who cares?
[1111.03s -> 1133.34s]  I don't know how to move. I'm serious. That's the map. Okay. How do you move faster? Okay. I got it.
[1133.34s -> 1153.10s]  I got it. I know what I'm doing. Let's go. Oh, so scary. Monsters. What the fuck are you doing?
[1168.06s -> 1216.20s]  What's up there? Oh, these shit guys. I'm sorry. I'm going to relax. I think I said wonka.
[1255.16s -> 1266.89s]  Open for a scroll. I sat down and turned off my lamp once more, but this time the shadowfall came
[1266.89s -> 1274.14s]  to me. I didn't run. I raised my gaze and moved to touch them. They blended with me, agony,
[1274.14s -> 1277.42s]  freedom, despair, understanding. Shut the fuck up.
[1286.81s -> 1295.96s]  What do you got? To be judged. To prove your worth. To satisfy your curiosity.
[1296.68s -> 1305.03s]  All to be forgotten here, like many others before you. I'm not picking my ass and moving to court.
[1305.99s -> 1347.90s]  How do I get the fuck? What is that for? Did I go the wrong way?
[1364.92s -> 1425.88s]  This way? Okay. All right. Okay. All right. Okay. Let's go. What does that noise mean? Watch it.
[1426.68s -> 1459.27s]  This way. Shit. Okay. That's quiet. Oh, okay. What is this? What is this? What are you doing?
[1459.99s -> 1487.10s]  What is it in these hands? Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Okay. Okay. Hold on.
[1493.85s -> 1544.79s]  Nothing. Nothing. God damn it. Who's the dog? Jesus Christ. That was the best YouTube reaction.
[1549.14s -> 1571.24s]  Let's go. You can only sprint for so long. I'm going to go right. I'm not going to go straight
[1571.24s -> 1592.14s]  ahead. Let's go right. I need oil. Fuck. I have no oil. How do I have no oil?
[1609.91s -> 1670.33s]  Oh, God. Nothing. Come on. What's in here? Oh, give it to me, please. I've seen the pillars.
[1670.33s -> 1680.15s]  They shine and chant. Fucking Jesus Christ. Give it to me, please. Burn him. Burn him.
[1690.95s -> 1721.35s]  Why did it go up? It's being left. Straight down. Oh, thank God. Okay. Checkpoint. I can see you
[1721.35s -> 1731.37s]  now, reader. You will not sit. You lied to me. Whatever. Can't you hear them, liar? It's the
[1731.37s -> 1763.91s]  pillars. They are chanting your name. Whatever. Get me the fuck out of here. Left. Oh, yes.
[1764.55s -> 1782.78s]  Got it. Got it. Fuck yeah. Let's go. One. Two more. Oh, that sucks. Okay. We're going this way,
[1782.78s -> 1815.46s]  then. That's it. Through here? Let's go. Is this right? I don't think it's right.
[1819.77s -> 1841.06s]  Didn't I already have one? Oh, I'm stupid. What an idiot. What an idiot. I know. I know. I know.
[1841.06s -> 1882.10s]  This way. Let's go. Two more. Let's go this way. What the fuck is that?
[1882.74s -> 1897.62s]  Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Open. Open. Open. Open. Open. This is
[1897.62s -> 1924.89s]  hard lock. Which way? Straight? What is this? Oh, fuck. What does that mean? What does that mean?
[1926.09s -> 1953.59s]  Oh, shit. I don't know what that means. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Is it the lady? Come on.
[1954.15s -> 2012.12s]  From here? I have no idea. What's it say? This is very loud. This way. What the fuck does that mean?
[2018.38s -> 2033.21s]  What does that even mean? Oh, shit. I don't know what that means. Oh, my god. I don't know what
[2033.21s -> 2038.71s]  that means. Oh, my god. I don't know what that means. I don't know what it means. How do I turn
[2038.71s -> 2077.53s]  this off? Oh, I don't know what it means. Oh, my god. Just sit here. Oh, fuck. Come on. Shit. Oh,
[2077.53s -> 2084.79s]  my god. I don't know what character it is. I don't know what it is. Oh, fuck.
[2095.46s -> 2144.46s]  Oh, my god. No fucking way. Jesus Christ. The same thing happened. So I check. There you go.
[2144.46s -> 2164.76s]  You're such a good actor. It's like you were really scared. God damn it. Let's go. It's hard
[2164.76s -> 2175.03s]  to talk when these are in. Immersing myself. Ay, ay, ay. Jesus Christ. Okay. Well, let's go.
[2188.12s -> 2203.51s]  Tuber reactions. Let's go. Speed run. Come on. Speed run. Not fucking around. Let's go.
[2204.31s -> 2214.46s]  Get to the eye. Right here. It's gonna be right here. Stupid game.
[2224.15s -> 2235.13s]  Come on. Just get there.
[2265.21s -> 2284.66s]  What is that? What is that? What is that? I don't know what that is. Oh, I'm gonna go this way.
[2284.66s -> 2315.66s]  Fuck. Shit. No. Wrong way. God damn it. I need one more eye and that's it.
[2316.66s -> 2332.87s]  Fuck me. Come on. Get it. Beat this game. Oh, god. Come on. Let's go. I've never seen that monster.
[2332.95s -> 2373.43s]  I know this. What is over here? Is it the dog? Is it the dog? Don't be the dog.
[2380.28s -> 2410.55s]  You hear that? Oh, shit. Oh, some creatures are attracted to your light. Okay. Let's go tell them.
[2410.55s -> 2420.15s]  Okay. I'll be over here. I'll be over here. Okay. What are you talking about?
[2420.15s -> 2440.06s]  What? What is talking? Who's talking? Holy shit. God. Give me a fucking. Jesus. Fucking Christ.
[2441.35s -> 2485.26s]  Holy shit. Oh, fuck. Please, God. Oh, my fucking God. Jesus. That was terrifying.

[2502.95s -> 2530.57s]  It's empty. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let's go. Let's go. That was terrifying.
[2530.57s -> 2539.78s]  Turn your light off. What the? Jesus. God. This is the scariest game I've ever played
[2539.78s -> 2545.70s]  and I've had a few drinks. It's fucking terrifying even with like four glasses of wine. God damn,
[2545.70s -> 2560.81s]  man. Come on. How did I end up here? I don't know. Why am I playing Dread Halls?
[2561.77s -> 2586.84s]  Oh, I don't know. It just kind of happens, huh? All right. Let's go. Fuck. I have the hiccups.
[2593.21s -> 2600.76s]  Nothing. Of course. I will. I'm going to beat this game before the stream turns off.

[3319.51s -> 3329.45s]  stamina. I'll be honest. I don't know how people fucking scream every day. I got no goddamn stamina.
[3330.41s -> 3337.90s]  Zero. I can do this shit for like six to ten hours. And I'm out of here for like a day.
[3338.94s -> 3352.97s]  I don't know how fucking people scream this long. I mean, like, I need like four days off. I'm kidding.
[3353.93s -> 3367.34s]  That's a joke. God, do you get it? Do you get it? Don't fuck this. Ready? Watch this shit.

[3608.60s -> 3611.29s]  What's going on?
[3611.29s -> 3624.65s]  Fuck.
[3624.65s -> 3626.65s]  5.8 by the way. Fuck off.
[3626.65s -> 3629.08s]  You want to measure me?
[3629.08s -> 3631.70s]  Sure. Next Monday.
[3631.70s -> 3634.46s]  Ugh.
[3634.46s -> 3636.46s]  5.8. Get over yourself.
[3636.46s -> 3640.10s]  Get over it.
[3640.10s -> 3653.74s]  5.8. Get over it.

[3672.79s -> 3674.79s]  Whoa.
[3674.79s -> 3678.76s]  Whoa.
[3678.76s -> 3680.76s]  Close the fucking door.
[3680.76s -> 3682.76s]  You terrible video game.
[3682.76s -> 3686.66s]  It won't do it.
[3686.66s -> 3688.66s]  Why won't you do it?
[3688.66s -> 3690.84s]  No.

[5389.45s -> 5391.45s]  It's really hard to contain myself. My knees hurt.
[5391.45s -> 5393.45s]  Oh my god. What the fuck happened?
[5393.45s -> 5395.45s]  Why would you do that to me?
[5395.45s -> 5399.99s]  Why would you do that to me?
[5399.99s -> 5409.72s]  Why would you do that?
[5409.72s -> 5417.72s]  I can't.
[5417.72s -> 5423.91s]  Oh my god.
[5423.91s -> 5425.91s]  I just felt the hands on me.
[5425.91s -> 5427.91s]  She's done that before.
[5427.91s -> 5431.30s]  She's in trouble.
[5431.30s -> 5434.50s]  I'm gonna give her a lecture.
[5434.50s -> 5441.34s]  Oh Jesus Christ.
[5441.34s -> 5443.34s]  You can't do that to somebody when they're in VR.
[5443.34s -> 5445.34s]  That's like the number one fucking rule.
[5445.34s -> 5447.34s]  You can't do that to
[5447.34s -> 5449.34s]  somebody when they're in VR.
[5449.34s -> 5452.46s]  I'm done. I'm gonna sit here
[5452.46s -> 5454.46s]  and hang out with you guys for a little bit.
[5454.46s -> 5460.28s]  Jesus Christ. I can't do it anymore.
[5460.28s -> 5462.78s]  Fuck me. Give me the chair.
[5462.78s -> 5486.58s]  Get this out of the way.
[5486.58s -> 5488.58s]  I'm returning this.
[5488.58s -> 5490.58s]  I'm gonna return the Vive.
[5490.58s -> 5504.28s]  This phone for a while.
[5504.28s -> 5516.82s]  We made her do it?
[5516.82s -> 5532.81s]  Anybody got a clip? I wanna see it.
[5532.81s -> 5534.81s]  What the fuck was that?
[5534.81s -> 5537.43s]  She was in here for a long time.
[5537.43s -> 5541.45s]  Hold on.
[5541.45s -> 5567.35s]  Let's see it.
[5567.35s -> 5569.53s]  I wanna see.
[5569.53s -> 5579.94s]  She was in here for a long time.
[5579.94s -> 5581.94s]  Oh my god. Give me a break.
[5581.94s -> 5585.08s]  What the fuck?
[5585.08s -> 5590.65s]  Hold on. You guys can't.
[5590.65s -> 5595.06s]  Before that?
[5595.06s -> 5597.37s]  What?
[5597.37s -> 5618.09s]  How long was she in here for?
[5618.09s -> 5641.58s]  I had no idea.
[5641.58s -> 5644.26s]  Anybody have the whole thing? I wanna see the whole thing.
[5644.26s -> 5653.27s]  I'm gonna die on camera. Is this it?
[5653.27s -> 5655.27s]  What? She's in the closet?
[5655.27s -> 5657.51s]  When did she get in the closet?
[5657.51s -> 5662.42s]  What?
[5662.42s -> 5664.42s]  Why is she in the closet?
[5664.42s -> 5666.42s]  What?
[5666.42s -> 5668.42s]  How long was she? What?
[5668.42s -> 5670.98s]  No, she was not.
[5670.98s -> 5672.98s]  She was in here from the break?
[5672.98s -> 5674.98s]  I don't fucking believe it.
[5674.98s -> 5676.98s]  No way. 30 minutes?
[5676.98s -> 5679.22s]  I don't believe it.
[5679.22s -> 5681.22s]  No fucking way.
[5681.22s -> 5684.04s]  She was in there for 30 minutes.
[5684.04s -> 5689.98s]  Why?
[5689.98s -> 5694.20s]  No, she wasn't.
[5694.20s -> 5699.26s]  She was in there for 30 minutes?
[5699.26s -> 5703.35s]  She's trying to kill me. Jesus Christ.
[5703.35s -> 5705.35s]  Go watch the VOD. I'm gonna bring up the VOD right now.
[5705.35s -> 5713.93s]  Why?
[5713.93s -> 5716.81s]  Why would you do this?
[5716.81s -> 5721.42s]  She's hiding in the closet.
[5721.42s -> 5723.42s]  This is what I get for not having the fucking chat.
[5723.42s -> 5729.37s]  She's in there here?
[5729.37s -> 5731.37s]  No, she's not.
[5731.37s -> 5733.37s]  No way. Hold on a second.
[5733.37s -> 5745.00s]  She's unbelievable.
[5745.00s -> 5747.30s]  I thought she was ordering food.
[5747.30s -> 5751.27s]  Let's watch this. I wanna see this.
[5751.27s -> 5763.74s]  She's not in there, is she?
[5763.74s -> 5767.06s]  No. What?
[5767.06s -> 5777.22s]  She's gotta be kidding me.
[5777.22s -> 5782.47s]  That's so scary.
[5782.47s -> 5786.38s]  I can't.
[5786.38s -> 5788.38s]  Alright, that's it.
[5788.38s -> 5810.39s]  Oh my god, you gotta be kidding me.
[5810.39s -> 5812.39s]  I'm gonna fill the closet with concrete.
[5812.39s -> 5869.22s]  I'm fucking muted.
[5879.21s -> 5882.79s]  What do the stocks look like?
[5882.79s -> 5884.79s]  What do the stocks look like? Let's take a look.
[5884.79s -> 5888.44s]  Did I go up at all?
[5888.44s -> 5894.58s]  I fucking have nothing to say.
[5894.58s -> 5904.42s]  She was here the whole time.
[5904.42s -> 5909.74s]  Jesus Christ.
[5909.74s -> 5911.74s]  I'm doing okay. I'm at 26 bucks.
[5911.74s -> 5914.68s]  That's better than fucking not marrying many people.
[5914.68s -> 5920.95s]  Well, I think that's gonna be it.
[5920.95s -> 5922.95s]  That's a good time to go up.
[5922.95s -> 5926.60s]  You took off the headset when she started to open it.
[5926.60s -> 5932.17s]  Too early?
[5932.17s -> 5934.17s]  Oh, let's hang out then. Fuck it. Let's go.
[5934.17s -> 5937.37s]  I'm selling my German stocks.
[5937.37s -> 5945.50s]  Look at this peak right here. That's a huge peak.
[5945.50s -> 5962.20s]  I mean, that's a sell point right there.
[5962.20s -> 5968.09s]  Oh my god.
[5968.09s -> 5970.78s]  What a scream.
[5970.78s -> 5972.78s]  Insider trading? It's okay. It's Twitch stocks.
[5972.78s -> 5975.32s]  Alright, I got money.
[5975.32s -> 5978.70s]  Let's go home. What do we got?
[5978.70s -> 5980.70s]  Uber Haxonova.
[5980.70s -> 5995.38s]  That's too much money.
[5995.38s -> 5997.38s]  Uber Haxonova is worth some money.
[5997.38s -> 6004.30s]  That's at 37 bucks. What the fuck?
[6004.30s -> 6006.30s]  I don't know who any of these people are.
[6006.30s -> 6013.45s]  Oh!
[6013.45s -> 6021.90s]  Trending! Trending!
[6021.90s -> 6024.26s]  Nine bucks?
[6024.26s -> 6050.81s]  That's a fucking steal.
[6050.81s -> 6063.80s]  What do we got? 30,000?
[6063.80s -> 6065.80s]  Alright, I think I got a good portfolio.
[6065.80s -> 6068.68s]  What's my portfolio? Account.
[6068.68s -> 6071.62s]  Let's see what we got.
[6071.62s -> 6073.62s]  We got Vinesauce, Kiwo, Dr. Disrespect,
[6073.62s -> 6075.62s]  Forsen, XQC, Destiny,
[6075.62s -> 6077.62s]  Uber Haxonova, Mizkif, Tylo and a Ninja.
[6077.62s -> 6080.89s]  Where's me?
[6080.89s -> 6086.26s]  Ninja's all...
[6086.26s -> 6088.26s]  I sold myself right off.
[6088.26s -> 6090.26s]  Fuck, you're right.
[6090.26s -> 6092.89s]  It's okay.
[6092.89s -> 6096.92s]  That's a good portfolio.
[6096.92s -> 6098.92s]  I don't think that's a bad portfolio.
[6098.92s -> 6121.82s]  Is there anybody who named Mike?
[6121.82s -> 6124.18s]  Nine bucks?
[6124.18s -> 6133.19s]  What are these gains?
[6133.19s -> 6136.84s]  What the fuck are these gains?
[6136.84s -> 6138.84s]  Dr. Disrespect for five dollars and twenty cents.
[6138.84s -> 6142.68s]  Okay. I got a lot of Vinesauce.
[6142.68s -> 6145.24s]  I got a lot of Mizkif.
[6145.24s -> 6149.40s]  I don't know. Should I have that much
[6149.40s -> 6152.73s]  of Mizkif? I don't know about that.
[6152.73s -> 6156.31s]  I think that might be too much.
[6156.31s -> 6158.31s]  I think that might be too much.
[6158.31s -> 6160.31s]  I got a lot of Kiwo.
[6160.31s -> 6168.25s]  Kiwo on the rise though, for real.
[6168.25s -> 6171.32s]  Mizkif.
[6171.32s -> 6183.29s]  Grillmaster doesn't exist, guys.
[6183.29s -> 6185.29s]  Look at back here though.
[6185.29s -> 6187.29s]  9.48?
[6187.29s -> 6189.29s]  This is going to come back.
[6189.29s -> 6207.06s]  Tomorrow.
[6207.06s -> 6209.06s]  What the fuck? Are you kidding me?
[6209.06s -> 6213.03s]  No! Fuck! No! Shhh! God damn it!
[6213.03s -> 6235.54s]  Wait! Really?
[6235.54s -> 6237.54s]  I want as much as I can get a Kiwo. I'm serious.
[6237.54s -> 6243.35s]  Look at this. Kiwo is going to fucking explode.
[6243.35s -> 6245.85s]  Look at this.
[6245.85s -> 6248.60s]  Already on the fucking uptake.
[6248.60s -> 6250.60s]  Buy as much Kiwo as you can possibly fucking purchase.
[6250.60s -> 6261.22s]  I'm serious.
[6261.22s -> 6284.01s]  Come on. Look at this. Are you serious?
[6284.01s -> 6289.06s]  I can't even do it.
[6289.06s -> 6298.47s]  It's fucking parabolic!
[6298.47s -> 6304.87s]  Alright. What time is it?
[6304.87s -> 6306.87s]  Ten? Fuck it. Let's hang out. AMA.
[6306.87s -> 6311.16s]  Ask me almost anything.
[6311.16s -> 6314.86s]  Let's go to IRL. I don't give a fuck.
[6314.86s -> 6340.38s]  I'm not done. That's better.
[6340.38s -> 6342.62s]  Just chatting. No! Fuck you, Twitch!
[6342.62s -> 6344.62s]  Give me a break. I can't believe it.
[6344.62s -> 6365.78s]  That's better. Okay.
[6365.78s -> 6373.40s]  Alright. Ask me anything.
[6373.40s -> 6376.86s]  I'll ask me anything right now.
[6376.86s -> 6379.29s]  What's my actual height? 5'7.5".
[6379.29s -> 6385.05s]  With shoes on 5'8". I'll measure it if you want.
[6385.05s -> 6389.40s]  Favorite YouTuber?
[6389.40s -> 6392.79s]  Donkey.
[6392.79s -> 6400.60s]  Yeah. Probably.
[6400.60s -> 6403.16s]  What am I going to do? Breakfast tomorrow?
[6403.16s -> 6409.30s]  Yogurt.
[6409.30s -> 6413.38s]  That's it. What do I think of Growmaster?
[6413.38s -> 6415.38s]  He's a fucking piece of shit.
[6415.38s -> 6417.62s]  He's a leech.
[6417.62s -> 6419.62s]  Whatever it takes to get viewers from my stream.
[6419.62s -> 6421.80s]  It's unfortunate but that's just the truth.
[6421.80s -> 6425.88s]  Sorry to say.
[6425.88s -> 6427.88s]  What's my favorite casino in Las Vegas?
[6427.88s -> 6429.88s]  Now that's a really good one actually. That's a really good one.
[6429.88s -> 6432.06s]  I have a real answer for you.
[6432.06s -> 6434.30s]  Are you ready? This is no bullshit.
[6434.30s -> 6437.61s]  The Aria.
[6437.61s -> 6439.91s]  The Aria in Las Vegas
[6439.91s -> 6441.91s]  on the strip, if you're talking strip casinos,
[6441.91s -> 6444.60s]  is my favorite casino.
[6444.60s -> 6447.10s]  I love the Aria.
[6447.10s -> 6450.94s]  And Circus Circus because the place is dumb.
[6450.94s -> 6456.06s]  But it's a good place though.
[6456.06s -> 6458.06s]  It's fun.
[6458.06s -> 6460.06s]  People are like fucking juggling and flying around in the ceiling.
[6460.06s -> 6463.06s]  Circus Circus is number two.
[6463.06s -> 6465.06s]  Aria is...I look like
[6465.06s -> 6467.06s]  fucking insane. Hold on. Give me a second.
[6467.06s -> 6473.66s]  Jesus Christ.
[6473.66s -> 6475.66s]  I'm going to get presentable. My God.
[6475.66s -> 6481.48s]  That's not going to fucking do anything.
[6481.48s -> 6484.87s]  Oh my God.
[6484.87s -> 6493.26s]  How do I get a Chad face?
[6493.26s -> 6499.14s]  Like this.
[6499.14s -> 6501.83s]  Am I mad at Kim?
[6501.83s -> 6504.95s]  No. What? It's funny.
[6504.95s -> 6507.32s]  Comedy trumps everything. Okay?
[6507.32s -> 6509.32s]  If somebody does something at your expense and it's funny,
[6509.32s -> 6514.36s]  it's fine.
[6514.36s -> 6516.36s]  No. Why would...she's wonderful.
[6516.36s -> 6518.36s]  What? Why would I be mad at my girlfriend?
[6518.36s -> 6520.36s]  For like hiding in the closet
[6520.36s -> 6522.66s]  for 30 minutes. No.
[6522.66s -> 6526.18s]  That was great. Only Chads have
[6526.18s -> 6528.18s]  kids. I don't have any kids. I'm never going to have kids
[6528.18s -> 6530.18s]  and it'll never happen. Next.
[6530.18s -> 6535.82s]  What's my workout routine?
[6535.82s -> 6539.66s]  I'll show you. That's it.
[6539.66s -> 6544.90s]  This is that once a day. Favorite fruit?
[6544.90s -> 6546.90s]  Banana. Nah.
[6546.90s -> 6548.90s]  Banana sucks. Um...
[6548.90s -> 6551.70s]  Lemon. It's probably lemon.
[6551.70s -> 6555.29s]  Why don't I want kids?
[6555.29s -> 6557.46s]  Because you have to change their diapers and they shit all over
[6557.46s -> 6561.30s]  themselves. That's it.
[6561.30s -> 6574.36s]  Am I a vegan? No.
[6574.36s -> 6577.11s]  Never will be.
[6577.11s -> 6579.11s]  Hamburgers are too tasty. I could never do it.
[6579.11s -> 6581.74s]  Steak and cheese subs
[6581.74s -> 6583.74s]  are the reason I could never be a vegan.
[6583.74s -> 6585.91s]  Because of Philly cheesesteaks.
[6585.91s -> 6587.91s]  I eat them like once a year. But that's the
[6587.91s -> 6593.29s]  reason. Would I eat lab
[6593.29s -> 6595.29s]  grown meat? Yeah.
[6595.29s -> 6598.62s]  Why not? I would try it once.
[6598.62s -> 6600.86s]  If I didn't like it then fucking I would fucking
[6600.86s -> 6604.70s]  delete my Twitch Prime.
[6604.70s -> 6606.70s]  Longest gone without changing underwear?
[6606.70s -> 6608.70s]  That's a pet peeve of mine. Not even a day.
[6608.70s -> 6610.87s]  I change my underwear once a day.
[6610.87s -> 6613.24s]  You think that's bullshit?
[6613.24s -> 6616.06s]  How could I prove that? There's no way.
[6616.06s -> 6622.58s]  Longest I've gone without showering?
[6622.58s -> 6625.46s]  A day. One day.
[6625.46s -> 6628.02s]  One day! That's it.
[6628.02s -> 6631.86s]  That's it. You used to be such a
[6631.86s -> 6633.86s]  meathead. Did you really stop lifting? Yeah
[6633.86s -> 6636.36s]  it just became too much.
[6636.36s -> 6638.36s]  I walk every day because I'm a fucking boomer.
[6638.36s -> 6640.92s]  I'm 34 in September.
[6640.92s -> 6642.92s]  Do you guys understand that? I'm 34.
[6642.92s -> 6644.92s]  I'm 34
[6644.92s -> 6646.92s]  in like a few months.
[6646.92s -> 6648.92s]  That's fucking old.
[6648.92s -> 6650.92s]  I can't go like throw weights around
[6650.92s -> 6655.08s]  anymore. You understand?
[6655.08s -> 6657.08s]  I can't do that anymore.
[6657.08s -> 6663.86s]  I wish I could. What's my
[6663.86s -> 6665.86s]  birthday? August 4th.
[6665.86s -> 6670.79s]  I did, I, that was
[6670.79s -> 6674.89s]  the, I told you I didn't want to give the
[6674.89s -> 6676.89s]  it's in September. I don't know why I did that.
[6676.89s -> 6681.88s]  Any conventions or meetups in the
[6681.88s -> 6684.38s]  future? Well it's funny you say that.
[6684.38s -> 6687.58s]  There is a place
[6687.58s -> 6689.88s]  in Las Vegas called
[6689.88s -> 6691.88s]  the Level Up Lounge.
[6691.88s -> 6695.70s]  Okay. This place is really
[6695.70s -> 6697.70s]  cool. They got like games. They have like skee ball.
[6697.70s -> 6700.01s]  They got like fucking
[6700.01s -> 6702.01s]  it's pretty cool. They got like a bar.
[6702.01s -> 6704.01s]  There's Jenga.
[6704.01s -> 6706.01s]  There's whole, there's like pool tables.
[6706.01s -> 6709.45s]  I was thinking
[6709.45s -> 6711.45s]  now hold on don't quote me on this. I'm
[6711.45s -> 6715.03s]  about to say it but don't quote me. I might.
[6715.03s -> 6717.03s]  Don't fucking quote me on this.
[6717.03s -> 6719.98s]  I'll be very upset about it. I might
[6719.98s -> 6722.34s]  see if I can do a
[6722.34s -> 6724.34s]  private party. Don't fucking
[6724.34s -> 6728.57s]  you dare quote me on this.
[6728.57s -> 6730.57s]  Where I rent out the Level Up Lounge
[6730.57s -> 6734.02s]  and we just have a fucking good
[6734.02s -> 6737.99s]  time. Don't quote me on that.
[6737.99s -> 6739.99s]  But I thought about it. Seems fun.
[6739.99s -> 6745.30s]  The Level Up Lounge is in
[6745.30s -> 6747.30s]  the MGM casino in Las
[6747.30s -> 6750.25s]  Vegas. And I'm like fuck
[6750.25s -> 6752.25s]  going to E3. What happened here?
[6752.25s -> 6755.06s]  Fuck E3. Fuck
[6755.06s -> 6757.06s]  I was going to say the T word.
[6757.06s -> 6759.06s]  Fuck like E3.
[6759.06s -> 6761.06s]  Fuck like PAX West.
[6761.06s -> 6763.06s]  No. Let's do our own shit. Right?
[6763.06s -> 6765.82s]  Let's do our own thing. Come to
[6765.82s -> 6767.82s]  Germacon at the Level Up Lounge.
[6767.82s -> 6772.23s]  This isn't real.
[6772.23s -> 6774.23s]  Like I hope they don't piss off somebody
[6774.23s -> 6776.23s]  at Level Up Lounge. It's a great place.
[6776.23s -> 6778.23s]  The place is fucking great.
[6778.23s -> 6780.23s]  It's a really, really clean, wonderful
[6780.23s -> 6782.60s]  place with a great bar.
[6782.60s -> 6788.23s]  We'll see. Come to Brazil.
[6788.23s -> 6790.23s]  I don't know. I don't got any money.
[6790.23s -> 6796.18s]  Germacon at the Level Up Lounge.
[6796.18s -> 6798.18s]  You can do a private party. We'll see. It might be fun.
[6798.18s -> 6800.36s]  There's a karaoke. You can like do
[6800.36s -> 6802.36s]  LAN parties. There's like a VR.
[6802.36s -> 6804.36s]  There's an entire VR setup
[6804.36s -> 6806.36s]  at the Level Up Lounge in MGM.
[6806.36s -> 6809.05s]  If you work for MGM,
[6809.05s -> 6812.18s]  you don't have my phone number but I might
[6812.18s -> 6817.50s]  give it to you at some point. That would be a lot of fun.
[6817.50s -> 6820.63s]  To do a full on like meetup
[6820.63s -> 6823.00s]  but open bar
[6823.00s -> 6825.43s]  and like open
[6825.43s -> 6827.43s]  karaoke, open VR setup.
[6827.43s -> 6829.43s]  I would just pay for the whole fucking
[6829.43s -> 6831.61s]  thing. And we could have like a good time.
[6831.61s -> 6833.61s]  If you're in Vegas for a fucking weekend, come on out.
[6833.61s -> 6835.91s]  This isn't really yet but it might be
[6835.91s -> 6840.97s]  in like a few months. Open bar is a
[6840.97s -> 6842.97s]  bad move. No it's not. It's a
[6842.97s -> 6847.96s]  good move. It would be
[6847.96s -> 6849.96s]  21 plus. Sorry.
[6849.96s -> 6852.14s]  It would have to be. Get
[6852.14s -> 6854.14s]  Penn and Teller. I would do my own magic
[6854.14s -> 6860.60s]  tricks. Open bar with VR.
[6860.60s -> 6862.60s]  I think that would be fun. It would
[6862.60s -> 6866.12s]  be. If I ponied
[6866.12s -> 6868.55s]  up the cash to have whoever
[6868.55s -> 6870.55s]  I mean, here's the thing I didn't understand
[6870.55s -> 6872.55s]  before I moved to Las Vegas is there's a
[6872.55s -> 6874.79s]  lot of people that live
[6874.79s -> 6876.79s]  in Vegas. A lot of you guys live here.
[6876.79s -> 6879.72s]  And in LA. So
[6879.72s -> 6882.47s]  fuck it. Let's do it. I don't care how much
[6882.47s -> 6886.95s]  it costs. Fuck it. Who cares?
[6886.95s -> 6889.58s]  It don't fucking matter. That doesn't matter.
[6889.58s -> 6892.01s]  If I can afford it, oh
[6892.01s -> 6898.92s]  you better fucking believe we'll do it.
[6898.92s -> 6902.38s]  Fuck it. VR chat
[6902.38s -> 6907.75s]  meetup.
[6907.75s -> 6909.75s]  Jerma lied about Minecraft VR5
[6909.75s -> 6914.94s]  community subs. Thank you. You could do that?
[6914.94s -> 6917.24s]  I probably could. I really
[6917.24s -> 6919.24s]  don't think that would cost that much money.
[6919.24s -> 6922.57s]  Is this drunk talk? Not really.
[6922.57s -> 6924.81s]  It's more like just hang out talk.
[6924.81s -> 6930.70s]  You can ask
[6930.70s -> 6933.26s]  Kim. Me and Kim went to this
[6933.26s -> 6935.26s]  place. And we specifically
[6935.26s -> 6937.26s]  it was like how fun would the speeders do with a meetup here?
[6937.26s -> 6940.01s]  Because I get you know
[6940.01s -> 6942.01s]  you can do a meetup at PAX. You can do a meetup at
[6942.01s -> 6944.01s]  E3. No. Fuck it. Let's do our own.
[6944.01s -> 6946.44s]  Let's do our big
[6946.44s -> 6950.22s]  bits. Oh Jesus. What happened?
[6950.22s -> 6952.22s]  Colonel Zero thanks for the 50 bucks.
[6952.22s -> 6955.03s]  Can you pay for my plane ticket?
[6955.03s -> 6957.03s]  No I can't. I can pay
[6957.03s -> 6959.03s]  for the booze at the bar.
[6959.03s -> 6961.40s]  And the space. But I can't
[6961.40s -> 6966.33s]  pay for plane tickets.
[6966.33s -> 6968.33s]  And he said this. Kim Dang
[6968.33s -> 6970.33s]  take a look at Kim Dang right there
[6970.33s -> 6978.71s]  talking about it. Let's do it.
[6978.71s -> 6981.46s]  I'll call these motherfuckers
[6981.46s -> 6983.46s]  no they're not motherfuckers. They're really great people.
[6983.46s -> 6985.46s]  I will call MGM tomorrow.
[6985.46s -> 6988.15s]  Yeah. Let's
[6988.15s -> 6990.15s]  do it. Fuck it. Let's do it.
[6990.15s -> 6994.81s]  Let's do it. Quote me.
[6994.81s -> 6997.82s]  Let's do it. Let's do
[6997.82s -> 6999.82s]  JermaCon at the level up lounge if it's possible.
[6999.82s -> 7009.34s]  Let's do it.
[7009.34s -> 7011.34s]  I'm not really that
[7011.34s -> 7013.34s]  tipsy at all.
[7013.34s -> 7016.79s]  I am but not really. I
[7016.79s -> 7018.79s]  swear to God this is something me and Kim were talking about
[7018.79s -> 7020.79s]  like last week. I swear to God this is for real.
[7020.79s -> 7025.91s]  I was
[7025.91s -> 7027.91s]  stone cold sober
[7027.91s -> 7029.91s]  when Kim and I were talking about this.
[7029.91s -> 7032.15s]  People saying flush?
[7032.15s -> 7034.52s]  That's the VR helmet. That's
[7034.52s -> 7036.52s]  not me. That's being in VR
[7036.52s -> 7040.30s]  for five hours. Yeah let's fucking
[7040.30s -> 7042.79s]  do it. Fuck it. I'm gonna
[7042.79s -> 7044.79s]  call them tomorrow. I swear to God.
[7044.79s -> 7052.79s]  What's the food situation? I don't know. We'll get
[7052.79s -> 7054.79s]  like fucking McDonald's delivered. Who cares?
[7054.79s -> 7060.36s]  How much water do I waste?
[7060.36s -> 7062.36s]  What the hell is that kind of? What?
[7062.36s -> 7066.90s]  How much water do I waste?
[7066.90s -> 7068.90s]  I don't waste water.
[7068.90s -> 7071.40s]  Confirm. Did I talk
[7071.40s -> 7073.90s]  about this last week? Did I talk
[7073.90s -> 7076.33s]  about that last week? Did I
[7076.33s -> 7078.33s]  talk about that last week? We went for
[7078.33s -> 7080.33s]  my birthday and he did talk
[7080.33s -> 7082.33s]  about this. He did.
[7082.33s -> 7084.33s]  I have like pictures of the level
[7084.33s -> 7086.33s]  lounge and I made sure to take pictures and stuff.
[7086.33s -> 7088.33s]  Excuse me. Look at the space. We're gonna
[7088.33s -> 7090.33s]  witness corroboration right here.
[7090.33s -> 7092.33s]  That's Kim by the way.
[7092.33s -> 7094.33s]  Hi. We're gonna witness
[7094.33s -> 7096.33s]  corroboration. I'm sorry I scared
[7096.33s -> 7098.33s]  you earlier. Oh my God. My knees
[7098.33s -> 7100.33s]  started to hurt so I actually had to leave.
[7100.33s -> 7102.33s]  Like I was like I need to get out of here.
[7102.33s -> 7104.57s]  I need to get out of here.
[7104.57s -> 7106.57s]  I was like I gotta get. I was trying to leave
[7106.57s -> 7108.57s]  like well I was just gonna leave but then
[7108.57s -> 7110.57s]  I started laughing too hard so I was
[7110.57s -> 7112.57s]  like oh I'm just gonna scare him.
[7112.57s -> 7114.57s]  It was bad. You just get the shit out of me.
[7117.64s -> 7119.64s]  But yeah see there we go.
[7119.64s -> 7121.64s]  Story corroboration. Yeah we went to the MGM
[7121.64s -> 7123.64s]  for my birthday and a couple other things
[7123.64s -> 7125.64s]  and we had a lot of fun there so we think
[7125.64s -> 7127.64s]  that people would have really
[7127.64s -> 7129.64s]  a lot of fun like meeting
[7129.64s -> 7131.64s]  us and drinking
[7131.64s -> 7133.64s]  and the bar was really like the bar was
[7133.64s -> 7135.64s]  really nice. The bowling alley was
[7135.64s -> 7137.64s]  really nice.
[7137.64s -> 7139.64s]  They had like a virtual VR set like
[7139.64s -> 7141.64s]  you go into the room and it's like all VR.
[7141.64s -> 7143.64s]  Karaoke too.
[7143.64s -> 7145.64s]  They had a giant Jenga
[7145.64s -> 7147.64s]  table. They had ski ball
[7147.64s -> 7149.64s]  pool. If anybody
[7149.64s -> 7151.64s]  likes to play pool they have that
[7151.64s -> 7153.64s]  too and what else. They had like a
[7153.64s -> 7155.64s]  like really hyped this up. It's like not
[7155.64s -> 7157.64s]  real yet. They have like a ton of space invader
[7157.64s -> 7159.64s]  games too like if you like to
[7159.64s -> 7161.64s]  oh my God. We're like hey
[7161.64s -> 7163.64s]  look at how fucking amazing the MGM
[7163.64s -> 7165.64s]  level up casino is and it's like
[7165.64s -> 7167.64s]  oh yeah. Oh and they have a photo booth there too.
[7167.64s -> 7169.64s]  They got a photo booth.
[7169.64s -> 7173.35s]  Oh and they have a bunch of painted
[7173.35s -> 7175.35s]  cats on there. Painted cats!
[7175.35s -> 7177.35s]  Are you kidding me?
[7177.35s -> 7179.35s]  No yeah they do. I have a picture right here.
[7179.35s -> 7184.34s]  Painted cats. No it's a cool
[7184.34s -> 7186.71s]  place. See? Are you sold?
[7186.71s -> 7189.08s]  They're the painted cats. Hey that's
[7189.08s -> 7191.90s]  what it looks like. We're like talking
[7191.90s -> 7195.35s]  up this place so much.
[7195.35s -> 7198.17s]  But uh you don't waste
[7198.17s -> 7200.73s]  water. Everybody knows that
[7200.73s -> 7202.73s]  they're just talking shit. You use a lot of plastic
[7202.73s -> 7208.68s]  though. Gotcha.
[7208.68s -> 7211.94s]  I use a lot of
[7211.94s -> 7213.94s]  plastic? What the fuck does that mean?
[7213.94s -> 7216.18s]  Plastic? Like single use
[7216.18s -> 7218.18s]  plastic? I put it in the recycling unit.
[7218.18s -> 7222.54s]  Uh oh. I'm getting compromised.
[7222.54s -> 7227.59s]  I
[7227.59s -> 7229.59s]  put plastic in the recycling
[7229.59s -> 7232.22s]  receptacle. I do.
[7232.22s -> 7234.58s]  Come on. Talk into the camera.
[7234.58s -> 7239.06s]  Tell them. He does
[7239.06s -> 7244.82s]  95% of the time.
[7244.82s -> 7246.82s]  100%
[7246.82s -> 7248.82s]  Alright. I love you.
[7248.82s -> 7256.17s]  I'll see you when you're done. Bye guys!
[7256.17s -> 7269.22s]  I recycle. I do.
[7269.22s -> 7271.46s]  I care about the environment.
[7271.46s -> 7273.46s]  I recycle. We got recycling here in
[7273.46s -> 7275.46s]  Vegas. I put everything. I don't know
[7275.46s -> 7278.47s]  what that was even about.
[7278.47s -> 7280.47s]  Recycle 95%.
[7280.47s -> 7282.47s]  You can't recycle everything.
[7282.47s -> 7284.47s]  Some recycling cannot be recycled.
[7284.47s -> 7286.47s]  If you've got bubble wrap
[7286.47s -> 7295.18s]  it's gotta be...
[7295.18s -> 7297.18s]  I recycle. I do.
[7297.18s -> 7308.57s]  Who's my favorite streamer?
[7308.57s -> 7315.59s]  Oh. Are you talking about
[7315.59s -> 7317.59s]  talent? Are you talking about who I think is the funniest?
[7317.59s -> 7320.47s]  Or what's interesting?
[7320.47s -> 7324.42s]  What do you think? Who?
[7324.42s -> 7326.42s]  Vinny. Joel.
[7326.42s -> 7329.43s]  They're always doing something fun.
[7329.43s -> 7331.43s]  Always doing something different.
[7331.43s -> 7333.43s]  Vinesauce. The whole Vinesauce team
[7333.43s -> 7335.43s]  always doing something fucking different.
[7335.43s -> 7337.43s]  They're always trying to make something fucking fun.
[7337.43s -> 7339.43s]  Follow them if you don't know who they are.
[7339.43s -> 7341.43s]  Joel, Varg, Skeletor.
[7341.43s -> 7343.43s]  Skelethor and Vinesauce obviously.
[7343.43s -> 7345.43s]  Criken
[7345.43s -> 7348.23s]  is always doing something fun.
[7348.23s -> 7350.23s]  Italics. Roommate.
[7350.23s -> 7352.73s]  Like, roommate
[7352.73s -> 7354.73s]  Literally is right here. Probably fucking sleeping.
[7361.45s -> 7367.34s]  Who else? Wake him up? Fine.
[7367.34s -> 7373.98s]  He probably heard that.
[7373.98s -> 7376.15s]  He's probably like, what the fuck are you doing?
[7376.15s -> 7379.93s]  Who else?
[7379.93s -> 7383.13s]  Who else is a streamer?
[7383.13s -> 7385.13s]  Fun streams?
[7385.13s -> 7389.61s]  I don't watch everybody.
[7389.61s -> 7393.51s]  He just watches
[7393.51s -> 7395.51s]  his own VOD start to finish.
[7395.51s -> 7397.51s]  Fuck off. Don't watch Italics.
[7397.51s -> 7399.51s]  He's fucking not even fun.
[7399.51s -> 7403.54s]  He's not even funny.
[7403.54s -> 7408.92s]  Honestly, Kiwo is great.
[7408.92s -> 7411.67s]  She does a lot of RP.
[7411.67s -> 7413.67s]  She does a lot of fucking character work.
[7413.67s -> 7415.85s]  She does a lot of editing. She's fucking hilarious.
[7415.85s -> 7417.85s]  Hysterical.
[7417.85s -> 7420.15s]  Go follow Kiwo. For real.
[7420.15s -> 7422.15s]  XQC is funny.
[7422.15s -> 7424.15s]  He's really just kind of all over the place out there.
[7424.15s -> 7426.15s]  He's funny. He's fun to kind of see.
[7426.15s -> 7429.21s]  Who else is
[7429.21s -> 7431.21s]  I think funny. Interesting.
[7431.21s -> 7439.08s]  Dance gaming.
[7439.08s -> 7441.08s]  Just OG. Dance gaming is fun to watch.
[7441.08s -> 7444.34s]  He's talking about his
[7444.34s -> 7455.93s]  investments.
[7455.93s -> 7457.93s]  You got me. You fucking got me.
[7457.93s -> 7459.93s]  I'll take it. I will. I will take that.
[7459.93s -> 7461.93s]  You did catch me
[7461.93s -> 7466.15s]  in the middle of my bullshit.
[7466.15s -> 7468.15s]  Star. Star. I mean
[7468.15s -> 7470.52s]  what can you say about Star?
[7470.52s -> 7472.52s]  One of the funniest, most talented fucking people on YouTube.
[7472.52s -> 7476.04s]  Still going on Twitch.
[7476.04s -> 7478.04s]  Still funny. Still interesting.
[7478.04s -> 7480.04s]  Give him a follow.
[7480.04s -> 7482.04s]  He's fucking OG. For real.
[7482.04s -> 7485.24s]  Who else?
[7485.24s -> 7492.15s]  Uberhacks on Nova.
[7492.15s -> 7496.38s]  Nova has been around for a long time too.
[7496.38s -> 7498.38s]  Moved to Twitch.
[7498.38s -> 7501.38s]  Still fun. Still interesting.
[7501.38s -> 7503.38s]  Critical. Critical is killing it on Twitch right now too.
[7503.38s -> 7505.38s]  There's too many people.
[7505.38s -> 7507.38s]  You understand? There's too many people.
[7507.38s -> 7509.38s]  There's so many fun. Look. Okay.
[7509.38s -> 7511.38s]  Germa985. This channel.
[7511.38s -> 7513.38s]  Sucks.
[7513.38s -> 7515.38s]  Don't leave now. Don't fucking watch.
[7515.38s -> 7517.82s]  No I'm kidding. Stay.
[7517.82s -> 7520.95s]  But there are so many fun channels
[7520.95s -> 7522.95s]  that are always trying to do new things.
[7522.95s -> 7525.19s]  Trying to keep going.
[7525.19s -> 7528.78s]  Excel. But don't leave.
[7528.78s -> 7532.68s]  Because I need you.
[7532.68s -> 7535.37s]  I need you.
[7535.37s -> 7537.37s]  At the table I'm going to spend like 15 grand.
[7537.37s -> 7539.61s]  I'm going to spend 15 grand.
[7539.61s -> 7544.46s]  How much is it to rent out
[7544.46s -> 7546.46s]  a fucking level up lounge? Let's find out.
[7546.46s -> 7548.63s]  Level up lounge
[7548.63s -> 7551.70s]  price.
[7551.70s -> 7557.70s]  That doesn't do anything.
[7557.70s -> 7561.29s]  Depends on the year. Yeah it does.
[7561.29s -> 7564.81s]  Grillmaster?
[7564.81s -> 7567.88s]  I hope Grillmaster
[7567.88s -> 7569.88s]  fucking throws himself off
[7569.88s -> 7573.72s]  of a fucking plan of existence.
[7573.72s -> 7576.54s]  He has talked so much
[7576.54s -> 7581.08s]  and his fans are unbearable.
[7581.08s -> 7583.08s]  Grillmaster x BBQ.
[7583.08s -> 7585.90s]  And his fans are relentless.
[7585.90s -> 7587.90s]  I'm just trying to stream
[7587.90s -> 7589.90s]  myself hanging out in IRL.
[7589.90s -> 7591.90s]  And they come in here and they fucking
[7591.90s -> 7598.62s]  throw themselves into the camera.
[7598.62s -> 7600.62s]  What? Gonna have to ban you?
[7600.62s -> 7602.62s]  Gonna have to ban you for
[7602.62s -> 7605.50s]  threatening other streamers?
[7605.50s -> 7607.50s]  Grillmaster doesn't even fucking stream.
[7607.50s -> 7610.89s]  Old joke. No.
[7610.89s -> 7612.89s]  This guy sucks.
[7612.89s -> 7623.50s]  Fuck this guy.
[7623.50s -> 7627.32s]  Who is he? Don't worry about it.
[7627.32s -> 7629.32s]  I'm not going to answer that question.
[7629.32s -> 7643.77s]  Ban?
[7643.77s -> 7645.77s]  I bet Grillmaster would be saving city goals.
[7645.77s -> 7648.14s]  Yeah this channel sucks.
[7648.14s -> 7650.14s]  Who cares? He doesn't even have a stock. I do.
[7650.14s -> 7655.13s]  I have a stock.
[7655.13s -> 7658.97s]  Does he have a stock?
[7658.97s -> 7662.55s]  No I don't think so.
[7662.55s -> 7667.48s]  I do. What is it at right now?
[7667.48s -> 7673.88s]  Not even in trending anymore.
[7673.88s -> 7690.52s]  What the fuck have you guys done? He sold out.
[7690.52s -> 7692.52s]  This is fake bullshit.
[7692.52s -> 7699.30s]  It's not even real. Maybe I should
[7699.30s -> 7701.80s]  stream better? I try.
[7701.80s -> 7705.64s]  Do I have any cringey old art?
[7705.64s -> 7709.29s]  How about some cringey new art?
[7709.29s -> 7711.29s]  How does that sound? Let's go for it.
[7711.29s -> 7715.83s]  No I don't.
[7715.83s -> 7867.32s]  How? I was quiet for a long time.
[7867.32s -> 7886.38s]  It's not bad. Alright that's it.
[7886.38s -> 7888.38s]  What else? What else you got?
[7888.38s -> 7894.76s]  Vinny said he loves you?
[7894.76s -> 7903.58s]  Hey thanks Vinny. You're a pretty good guy.
[7903.58s -> 7905.58s]  Explain becoming a tree. Alright alright alright.
[7905.58s -> 7911.53s]  This is important.
[7911.53s -> 7913.53s]  Everybody that was going to leave
[7913.53s -> 7915.53s]  has already left.
[7915.53s -> 7917.53s]  We had like forty four hundred people here.
[7917.53s -> 7920.28s]  Like two hours ago.
[7920.28s -> 7922.28s]  They moved on. They probably watched
[7922.28s -> 7924.28s]  that's fine. But the twenty eight hundred
[7924.28s -> 7933.50s]  people that are still here.
[7933.50s -> 7937.53s]  What is going on with trees?
[7937.53s -> 7940.86s]  You cut their limbs off. They come back.
[7940.86s -> 7944.70s]  How have we not
[7944.70s -> 7947.06s]  figured out as humans
[7947.06s -> 7949.43s]  how to genetically
[7949.43s -> 7951.93s]  tap into that
[7951.93s -> 7955.32s]  complete regrowth?
[7955.32s -> 7957.56s]  Seriously. Trees they
[7957.56s -> 7959.56s]  fucking grow back. They last
[7959.56s -> 7961.56s]  thousands of years some trees.
[7961.56s -> 7966.23s]  Imagine in a hundred years
[7966.23s -> 7968.23s]  if they can tap into
[7968.23s -> 7976.10s]  the DNA of trees.
[7976.10s -> 7992.62s]  I'm getting made photo. It was
[7992.62s -> 7994.62s]  a thought experiment. Never mind.
[7994.62s -> 8000.63s]  No no no no no. Listen listen.
[8000.63s -> 8005.50s]  Besides humans.
[8005.50s -> 8011.64s]  Right? Did I eat any
[8011.64s -> 8015.03s]  edibles? No. No.
[8015.03s -> 8017.03s]  Not tonight. Not any night.
[8017.03s -> 8021.06s]  Oh they got a picture of the black hole.
[8021.06s -> 8023.75s]  That's right. They got a full on picture
[8023.75s -> 8026.63s]  of the black hole. Let's take a look at it.
[8026.63s -> 8040.44s]  Black hole. There it is.
[8040.44s -> 8057.83s]  It's not boring. It's a good donut. Let's see it.
[8057.83s -> 8063.40s]  So this is a picture of a black hole.
[8063.40s -> 8069.93s]  I mean it kind of looks like what happens when you go
[8069.93s -> 8071.93s]  underwater and open your eyes and look
[8071.93s -> 8075.26s]  at the light. That shit's coming for you.
[8075.26s -> 8077.26s]  And it's going to wipe out everybody.
[8077.26s -> 8082.76s]  That's the last thing you see before you die.
[8082.76s -> 8089.98s]  Yep. Like a blurry
[8089.98s -> 8101.50s]  like the ring three image.
[8101.50s -> 8105.21s]  Can I what?
[8105.21s -> 8107.96s]  What the fuck did you just say? Holy shit.
[8107.96s -> 8112.63s]  Why worry about black holes
[8112.63s -> 8114.63s]  when your stream is this derailed?
[8114.63s -> 8116.87s]  I made that up. Somebody didn't write that.
[8116.87s -> 8118.87s]  I said that pretending to be a chat member.
[8118.87s -> 8135.64s]  How long has this stream been
[8135.64s -> 8148.76s]  six and a half hours? Watch
[8148.76s -> 8151.90s]  an old video? Ah.
[8151.90s -> 8159.29s]  No. Not tonight.
[8159.29s -> 8169.59s]  Not tonight. Do a backflip. Sure.
[8169.59s -> 8192.17s]  Fucking easy.
[8192.17s -> 8199.02s]  Fucking easiest thing I've done all day.
[8199.02s -> 8211.62s]  Any other questions or requests? Do a
[8211.62s -> 8213.62s]  cartwheel? Fucking easiest thing
[8213.62s -> 8222.84s]  I've done all day. I'll do two.
[8222.84s -> 8225.59s]  You want two? Fine. I'll do two.
[8225.59s -> 8236.97s]  What? I'm going to kick
[8236.97s -> 8238.97s]  I'm going to kick that and I don't want to kick it.
[8238.97s -> 8255.80s]  Get this off! I'm just kidding.
[8255.80s -> 8271.16s]  I'm so self conscious about this
[8271.16s -> 8273.53s]  hair. It's so bad.
[8273.53s -> 8281.14s]  Will I ever go to Australia?
[8281.14s -> 8285.03s]  No. Probably not. Look at the link.
[8285.03s -> 8291.61s]  What link? I don't see a link.
[8291.61s -> 8329.48s]  I see. Where is it?
[8329.48s -> 8345.22s]  I just saved it. There it is.
[8347.22s -> 8352.34s]  Am I looking forward to Game of Thrones?
[8352.34s -> 8355.14s]  Yeah. I don't know.
[8355.14s -> 8360.07s]  Maybe. A little.
[8360.07s -> 8369.10s]  Wider? I can't look at that shit for more than
[8369.10s -> 8376.57s]  five seconds. Alright.
[8376.57s -> 8381.30s]  I think that's it. I've embarrassed myself
[8381.30s -> 8383.30s]  for a night at least.
[8383.30s -> 8389.82s]  Mine show was a lot of fun.
[8389.82s -> 8391.82s]  It just technically had some problems.
[8391.82s -> 8405.05s]  Thanks for the stream. Thanks for watching.
[8405.05s -> 8408.89s]  There's a lot of people fucking here. Thanks for
[8408.89s -> 8412.92s]  giving me your time. As much as
[8412.92s -> 8416.50s]  I think maybe. Thank you.
[8416.50s -> 8424.57s]  I put raw garlic in my head?
[8424.57s -> 8426.87s]  What? I don't know what you said.
[8426.87s -> 8430.39s]  No for real. You guys
[8430.39s -> 8433.40s]  there were a lot of people here. I hope you had fun.
[8433.40s -> 8440.49s]  Thank you. We will do the
[8440.49s -> 8442.49s]  bits. I'm
[8442.49s -> 8446.20s]  probably. I said I was going to
[8446.20s -> 8448.82s]  do three days in a row. I might be
[8448.82s -> 8451.26s]  a liar. Am I a fucking liar?
[8451.26s -> 8453.26s]  I don't want to be a liar.
[8453.26s -> 8457.16s]  Now we're not done. We're not done. We're still going.
[8457.16s -> 8464.90s]  What do we got?
[8464.90s -> 8470.15s]  Are there any other games? It's late
[8470.15s -> 8473.61s]  but who cares? Fuck it.
[8473.61s -> 8477.96s]  What is it? VTOL?
[8477.96s -> 8479.96s]  VTOL VR.
[8479.96s -> 8484.04s]  Let me look that up. VTOL
[8484.04s -> 8486.73s]  VR. What is this?
[8486.73s -> 8489.29s]  VTOL VR.
[8489.29s -> 8493.19s]  Combat flight sim game.
[8493.19s -> 8495.50s]  You trying to make me throw up?
[8495.50s -> 8504.78s]  V. Alright.
[8504.78s -> 8507.14s]  I'll buy it. Fuck it. I'll buy it
[8507.14s -> 8509.62s]  right now. Let's go.
[8509.62s -> 8519.99s]  VTOL VR. Fuck it.
[8519.99s -> 8529.53s]  Let's go. Don't push yourself. We all love
[8529.53s -> 8531.53s]  your health is number one. No. I mean I had
[8531.53s -> 8534.47s]  three days off. You guys know this
[8534.47s -> 8537.16s]  right? I told you guys this
[8537.16s -> 8539.16s]  a long time ago. And by long. I mean like three
[8539.16s -> 8541.91s]  days ago. I take a
[8541.91s -> 8543.91s]  lot of time off to like
[8543.91s -> 8547.03s]  be ready. So.
[8547.03s -> 8550.36s]  No I'm good. I feel great.
[8550.36s -> 8552.66s]  What did Kim say? What did Kim
[8552.66s -> 8555.10s]  say? What is she saying now?
[8555.10s -> 8559.13s]  I didn't even see it. I didn't
[8559.13s -> 8564.70s]  see it. VTOL
[8564.70s -> 8566.70s]  VR. VR Josh.
[8566.70s -> 8570.15s]  No I owe it to you guys for
[8570.15s -> 8572.15s]  a fucking longer stream. I do. I really
[8572.15s -> 8574.15s]  do. I swear to god. I just typed
[8574.15s -> 8576.15s]  in VR Josh into Steam. That's not
[8576.15s -> 8590.15s]  that's not it.
[8590.15s -> 8592.15s]  No I do because you guys
[8592.15s -> 8594.46s]  you guys are fucking great. Don't worry.
[8594.46s -> 8597.72s]  He doesn't know. She's not in there anymore.
[8597.72s -> 8600.34s]  Okay. Kim's not
[8600.34s -> 8606.62s]  in the closet anymore. Look
[8606.62s -> 8667.29s]  I just lived like 30
[8667.29s -> 8671.13s]  years. I went in there and like
[8671.13s -> 8673.50s]  I jumped into a fucking another person's
[8673.50s -> 8680.73s]  body. I just barely fucking
[8680.73s -> 8682.73s]  came out. It was like 30 fucking years of a person.
[8682.73s -> 8686.12s]  Acting fucking one on
[8686.12s -> 8688.42s]  one. Give me a break. I could out
[8688.42s -> 8690.42s]  act Brad Pitt. Fucking give me a scene with
[8690.42s -> 8697.02s]  him. Give me any scene. It
[8697.02s -> 8699.02s]  doesn't matter what it is. Did you see how good that was?
[8699.02s -> 8701.26s]  My god it was fucking fantastic.
[8701.26s -> 8705.22s]  Setup tour?
[8705.22s -> 8708.10s]  Yeah sure. There's
[8708.10s -> 8710.10s]  a computer. And there's the other
[8710.10s -> 8712.10s]  computer. And there's my fucking desk.
[8712.10s -> 8714.41s]  As you see there is a
[8714.41s -> 8718.31s]  wine. And there's
[8718.31s -> 8732.07s]  me. Nothing else here.
[8732.07s -> 8738.14s]  Is this game any fun? Can we
[8738.14s -> 8740.14s]  see a bathroom? Yeah sure.
[8740.14s -> 8742.14s]  It doesn't go that far.
[8742.14s -> 8751.29s]  Is this installing or what?
[8751.29s -> 8759.48s]  Install the game? What the fuck are you doing?
[8759.48s -> 8765.42s]  I just bought it.
[8765.42s -> 8767.42s]  I don't know why this is not happening.
[8767.42s -> 8770.55s]  I don't get it. Show tax returns?
[8770.55s -> 8772.55s]  Alright. So show my asshole. Okay.
[8772.55s -> 8777.74s]  Here we go. Where is that game?
[8777.74s -> 8785.03s]  I just bought it. VTOL?
[8785.03s -> 8787.03s]  I just fucking bought it.
[8787.03s -> 8791.77s]  Where the hell is it? In
[8791.77s -> 8793.77s]  add to cart. What did I just buy?
[8793.77s -> 8796.97s]  What did I seriously just buy?
[8796.97s -> 8805.91s]  What? I don't understand
[8805.91s -> 8809.11s]  what I just purchased. I just
[8809.11s -> 8811.11s]  bought it. I just bought it.
[8811.11s -> 8813.67s]  Purchase. Your account already
[8813.67s -> 8822.68s]  owns the game. There it is.
[8822.68s -> 8827.48s]  Let's go. Oh my god he
[8827.48s -> 8868.49s]  leaked. Relax.
[8868.49s -> 8898.25s]  BRB? This was
[8898.25s -> 8900.25s]  30 bucks. I hope you fucking understand.
[8900.25s -> 8902.87s]  The things I do for
[8902.87s -> 8910.42s]  love. Look at me.
[8910.42s -> 8919.51s]  Look at me. VTOL.
[8919.51s -> 8927.94s]  Alright. Did we get Chinese food?
[8927.94s -> 8930.95s]  Did we get Chinese
[8930.95s -> 8933.77s]  food like an hour and a half ago? What happened?
[8933.77s -> 8937.46s]  Where is it? I
[8937.46s -> 8943.22s]  could go for some crab rangooz right now. Why am I
[8943.22s -> 8949.11s]  like 15 feet tall? Should
[8949.11s -> 8953.46s]  I be this big? I don't
[8953.46s -> 8960.06s]  understand. Why am I like 15
[8960.06s -> 8965.50s]  feet tall?
[8965.50s -> 8984.76s]  What's happening?
[8984.76s -> 8988.60s]  VR Josh told me to buy this.
[8988.60s -> 8993.19s]  All of them accountable. Okay?
[8993.19s -> 8998.49s]  Where's the audio? No chat.
[8998.49s -> 9002.76s]  Don't scare me. What is this?
[9002.76s -> 9004.94s]  The Chinese food I ordered?
[9004.94s -> 9007.94s]  I didn't order the Chinese food.
[9007.94s -> 9009.94s]  You have spare ribs downstairs and
[9009.94s -> 9011.94s]  you have pad thai downstairs too.
[9011.94s -> 9018.02s]  You just want one?
[9018.02s -> 9021.72s]  I just heard. A little birdie
[9021.72s -> 9026.39s]  told me.
[9026.39s -> 9028.63s]  Mmm. Mmm.
[9028.63s -> 9030.63s]  Mwah. Mwah. Mwah.
[9030.63s -> 9032.63s]  Fantastic. Okay.
[9032.63s -> 9037.82s]  Well, I'm going to leave these notes for free.
[9037.82s -> 9051.51s]  Can you guys hear this?
[9051.51s -> 9068.66s]  Why did you tell me to buy
[9068.66s -> 9071.42s]  this? Help make preparations
[9071.42s -> 9074.87s]  depending on the dress for personnel?
[9074.87s -> 9077.75s]  I don't... Negotiations for
[9077.75s -> 9079.75s]  priests? No! This is not going to come through the ro...
[9079.75s -> 9095.99s]  Why did I buy this?
[9095.99s -> 9102.97s]  I don't know why I bought this. That crab
[9102.97s -> 9104.97s]  rangooz was fucking fantastic.
[9104.97s -> 9107.91s]  Okay. I'm ready.
[9107.91s -> 9113.10s]  So what do I do? Fly.
[9113.10s -> 9118.46s]  Okay. Fly.
[9118.46s -> 9144.76s]  Align your seat with the...
[9144.76s -> 9162.04s]  Align your seat with the virtual
[9162.04s -> 9164.98s]  grip helmet when ready. I'm ready.
[9164.98s -> 9166.98s]  Okay. Let's go. I'm ready.
[9166.98s -> 9174.92s]  Where's the audio? What the fuck?
[9174.92s -> 9187.53s]  I can't... This is... I can't
[9187.53s -> 9203.91s]  hear this. Why is it come...
[9203.91s -> 9220.02s]  What? Nav off?
[9220.02s -> 9223.67s]  Hover mode? HD?
[9223.67s -> 9227.00s]  What the fuck is this?
[9227.00s -> 9236.01s]  Grip? How do I get out of here?
[9236.01s -> 9239.34s]  Landing?
[9239.34s -> 9242.09s]  This is too much!
[9242.09s -> 9244.09s]  Grip? Jenison?
[9244.09s -> 9254.58s]  This is $30!
[9254.58s -> 9260.15s]  Just toggle flight assist?
[9260.15s -> 9267.90s]  What do I do with this?
[9267.90s -> 9279.78s]  How do I drive?
[9279.78s -> 9283.35s]  All? None?
[9283.35s -> 9285.66s]  Go? Navigation? Nav?
[9285.66s -> 9287.66s]  No. That's night vision.
[9287.66s -> 9290.15s]  How do I get that off? Get off!
[9290.15s -> 9292.15s]  I don't want night vision.
[9292.15s -> 9294.15s]  I don't know what this does. HUD?
[9294.15s -> 9304.46s]  Brightness?
[9304.46s -> 9307.78s]  Why did you tell me to buy this?
[9307.78s -> 9309.78s]  I'm going to be fucking forever in goods. I'm out of here.
[9309.78s -> 9316.06s]  Eject?
[9316.06s -> 9329.11s]  Where is eject? Grip?
[9329.11s -> 9333.34s]  How do I fly?
[9333.34s -> 9335.83s]  How do I turn it off?
[9335.83s -> 9338.07s]  Turn it off!
[9338.07s -> 9340.07s]  Turn off the...
[9340.07s -> 9343.59s]  What is this? Eject?
[9343.59s -> 9385.56s]  I'm gonna throw up. I don't know
[9385.56s -> 9401.56s]  what I bought that for.
[9401.56s -> 9405.27s]  Try tomorrow.
[9405.27s -> 9410.39s]  We'll see. I'm okay. I just wanted
[9410.39s -> 9412.39s]  to play when not
[9412.39s -> 9416.41s]  drunk. That was a
[9416.41s -> 9426.39s]  good walk going on there.
[9426.39s -> 9428.39s]  Well, thank you for watching everybody.
[9428.39s -> 9433.37s]  That's it. I'm gonna go eat some
[9433.37s -> 9435.37s]  crab rangoons. I did not think
[9435.37s -> 9437.99s]  this was going to be a seven hour stream.
[9437.99s -> 9442.09s]  What is going on here? I don't... whatever.
[9442.09s -> 9448.04s]  Thanks for watching. Thanks for thinking
[9448.04s -> 9451.18s]  around. I'll see you guys
[9451.18s -> 9454.06s]  hopefully tomorrow.
[9454.06s -> 9456.06s]  Unless we sit here and have another glass of wine
[9456.06s -> 9458.06s]  and have a few conversations.
[9458.06s -> 9464.89s]  I'll probably be
[9464.89s -> 9467.32s]  live tomorrow. What the fuck was I doing?
[9467.32s -> 9475.19s]  In actuality,
[9475.19s -> 9477.19s]  I'll probably see you on fucking...
[9477.19s -> 9479.19s]  on Friday, probably.
[9479.19s -> 9482.78s]  What an idiot.
[9482.78s -> 9485.21s]  What a stupid motherfucker.
[9485.21s -> 9487.21s]  Like I was gonna do three VR days in a row
[9487.21s -> 9489.21s]  like four to five hours each. This is like a seven hour
[9489.21s -> 9491.21s]  drunk stream. What a dumb dickhead.
[9491.21s -> 9505.16s]  But, regardless,
[9505.16s -> 9507.46s]  I actually
[9507.46s -> 9509.46s]  had a lot of fun. Hope you did too.
[9509.46s -> 9511.96s]  If you didn't, I'm sorry.
[9511.96s -> 9513.96s]  I can do better. I'll try better. I'll try
[9513.96s -> 9516.65s]  harder. If you did,
[9516.65s -> 9518.65s]  I'm glad you did. If not, then I'm
[9518.65s -> 9523.32s]  trying. I'll see you soon.
[9523.32s -> 9525.32s]  I'm gonna go have some crab rangoons, but
[9525.32s -> 9530.44s]  let's do the bits.
[9530.44s -> 9532.44s]  Look, I look drunker than I am,
[9532.44s -> 9534.44s]  okay? It looks like somebody fucking
[9534.44s -> 9536.44s]  shook me up and threw me and hit me in the
[9536.44s -> 9538.44s]  face with a shovel.
[9538.44s -> 9541.00s]  That's because of the hair.
[9541.00s -> 9543.30s]  Okay? Look, ready?
[9543.30s -> 9545.61s]  How do I look now? Probably pretty
[9545.61s -> 9549.05s]  good. But like,
[9549.05s -> 9551.05s]  it's the hair. The hair fucks me up. I'm deleted.
[9551.05s -> 9555.59s]  But thank
[9555.59s -> 9557.59s]  you so much for joining me. I'll see you soon.
[9557.59s -> 9559.83s]  I hope you liked it.
[9559.83s -> 9562.26s]  I did.
[9562.26s -> 9564.26s]  I had a great time.
[9564.26s -> 9572.38s]  But, let's do the bits.
[9572.38s -> 9574.38s]  See you guys in probably a day and a half.
[9574.38s -> 9577.70s]  Because
[9577.70s -> 9579.70s]  Jeremy's 34 and drinks
[9579.70s -> 9581.70s]  and has to sleep for a whole day.
[9581.70s -> 9583.70s]  Took three days off.
[9583.70s -> 9585.70s]  God damn it. What an idiot.
[9585.70s -> 9587.70s]  What an asshole.
[9587.70s -> 9589.70s]  Thank you guys.
[9589.70s -> 9591.70s]  So, we had a
[9591.70s -> 9593.70s]  meaty-matey. Thanks for 10 bucks.
[9593.70s -> 9597.03s]  Especially with wine. What a bad choice.
[9597.03s -> 9599.03s]  But it was fun. I had a great time.
[9599.03s -> 9601.03s]  I had a great fucking time. I really did.
[9601.03s -> 9604.23s]  What a blast. I really did.
[9604.23s -> 9607.30s]  Uh, meaty-matey
[9607.30s -> 9609.61s]  10 bucks. Thank you for
[9609.61s -> 9611.61s]  brightening all of our days with your streams
[9611.61s -> 9613.61s]  and being the only person I can watch on Twitch.
[9613.61s -> 9616.55s]  Uh, thank you.
[9616.55s -> 9620.89s]  That means a lot.
[9620.89s -> 9622.89s]  I hope you enjoy yourself here. I really do.
[9622.89s -> 9627.37s]  Regardless if I drink
[9627.37s -> 9629.37s]  wine or not, I hope you
[9629.37s -> 9631.37s]  have fun. Cause I had fun.
[9631.37s -> 9634.50s]  I hope that means you did too.
[9634.50s -> 9636.50s]  Uh, Superintendent Chalmers, thanks for the 250.
[9636.50s -> 9638.74s]  Please grow a massive
[9638.74s -> 9640.74s]  Tormund beard. It would be a scarecrow. It would be
[9640.74s -> 9642.74s]  terrible. You wouldn't want to look at it.
[9642.74s -> 9645.50s]  It would be ugly.
[9645.50s -> 9650.55s]  Uh, Smelly Boy, thanks for the 250.
[9650.55s -> 9652.55s]  Desk infested by Gamer God.
[9652.55s -> 9655.05s]  I don't know what that means,
[9655.05s -> 9657.86s]  but thank you. Bake me
[9657.86s -> 9659.86s]  home 250. Less than 20 days
[9659.86s -> 9661.86s]  till Avengers. Are we excited or what?
[9661.86s -> 9666.33s]  Yeah,
[9666.33s -> 9669.06s]  kind of. Kind of.
[9669.06s -> 9672.20s]  It would be a good movie. Hope it is.
[9672.20s -> 9674.20s]  What wine am I drinking? This is a Malbec.
[9674.20s -> 9676.63s]  Malbec is my favorite wine.
[9676.63s -> 9680.71s]  It is the best.
[9680.71s -> 9682.71s]  If you can get your hands on a Malbec,
[9682.71s -> 9685.21s]  please do. It's good shit.
[9685.21s -> 9689.05s]  Jerma lied about stream
[9689.05s -> 9691.05s]  legends. What kind of name
[9691.05s -> 9696.36s]  is that? That's not, I do that
[9696.36s -> 9698.66s]  every day. Every, of the stream.
[9698.66s -> 9700.66s]  What are you, what? What are you talking about?
[9700.66s -> 9706.81s]  I do that every stream.
[9706.81s -> 9710.52s]  You'll get it at the end.
[9710.52s -> 9714.36s]  I promise. Door Cube. Hey,
[9714.36s -> 9716.79s]  Door Cube, thanks for the 250 Door Cube.
[9716.79s -> 9718.79s]  You are screaming way too much. I did not
[9718.79s -> 9720.79s]  raise you like this. I did not raise you
[9720.79s -> 9722.79s]  like this. You scream too much.
[9722.79s -> 9728.36s]  I forget every
[9728.36s -> 9731.11s]  skit I made in that
[9731.11s -> 9734.44s]  game. I hope they were funny.
[9734.44s -> 9736.74s]  Hahaha.
[9736.74s -> 9739.05s]  Uh, thank you
[9739.05s -> 9741.05s]  Kombino for the five dollars.
[9741.05s -> 9744.06s]  Hey Jerma, it's me Kombine. My
[9744.06s -> 9746.06s]  account was stolen by
[9746.06s -> 9748.06s]  someone from Malaysia.
[9748.06s -> 9750.06s]  Can you make characters have sex with each other
[9750.06s -> 9752.06s]  in this game? Do it. I give you money.
[9752.06s -> 9758.20s]  Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Kombine.
[9758.20s -> 9762.17s]  I don't think you can.
[9762.17s -> 9764.17s]  Maybe if you really put your
[9764.17s -> 9766.17s]  imagination into it. Maybe.
[9766.17s -> 9768.73s]  Ugh.
[9768.73s -> 9770.73s]  Hey Flugboy,
[9770.73s -> 9772.73s]  thanks for the 20 bucks, Flugboy.
[9772.73s -> 9775.85s]  20 bucks. Hey Jerma,
[9775.85s -> 9777.85s]  I thought I'd drop you a good amount of bids tonight. Hope you
[9777.85s -> 9779.85s]  are doing well and having a beautiful Duwang.
[9779.85s -> 9782.09s]  Duwang.
[9782.09s -> 9786.18s]  Also, really
[9786.18s -> 9788.18s]  I'm hoping Keem comes down
[9788.18s -> 9790.18s]  and smacks you after screaming.
[9790.18s -> 9792.86s]  She did. She scared the
[9792.86s -> 9796.70s]  fuck out of me. Ah, that's a Jojo
[9796.70s -> 9802.26s]  reference. Okay. Thank you
[9802.26s -> 9804.26s]  though. Thank you Frodeon Weapon for the 250.
[9804.26s -> 9806.26s]  No message, but thank you Frodeon.
[9806.26s -> 9808.50s]  Internet, Jorge, thanks for the 15
[9808.50s -> 9810.68s]  bucks. Nothing makes me laugh
[9810.68s -> 9812.68s]  harder and my day better than
[9812.68s -> 9814.68s]  watching the stream and chat devolve into absolute
[9814.68s -> 9816.68s]  madness. Much
[9816.68s -> 9820.14s]  love, Jerma. Much love to
[9820.14s -> 9826.34s]  you. I mean, you just watch the guy
[9826.34s -> 9828.34s]  like drink wine and get like drunk
[9828.34s -> 9830.34s]  and play a
[9830.34s -> 9833.93s]  VR game. And I made
[9833.93s -> 9836.49s]  a fucking ton of money. Seriously.
[9836.49s -> 9839.18s]  Do you understand like how
[9839.18s -> 9841.18s]  much that fucking means to me?
[9841.18s -> 9847.58s]  I can't even tell you.
[9847.58s -> 9849.58s]  I really can't.
[9849.58s -> 9855.14s]  I wish there was another way
[9855.14s -> 9860.95s]  that I could tell you that.
[9860.95s -> 9864.15s]  Thank you for everything. And
[9864.15s -> 9868.06s]  as long as you're having a
[9868.06s -> 9870.81s]  good time, that's all I fucking
[9870.81s -> 9872.81s]  care about. That's the only fucking
[9872.81s -> 9876.39s]  thing I care about. Even if
[9876.39s -> 9878.39s]  I feel like I need to talk shit and make fun of
[9878.39s -> 9880.82s]  it. Of course, we're all gonna
[9880.82s -> 9883.13s]  prod at the stream sometimes.
[9883.13s -> 9886.44s]  Thank you.
[9886.44s -> 9888.44s]  You guys mean more than you think.
[9888.44s -> 9892.97s]  Seriously.
[9892.97s -> 9900.90s]  For real. Never ever in a million
[9900.90s -> 9902.90s]  years did I think that somebody would think it was fun.
[9902.90s -> 9904.90s]  To like watch me
[9904.90s -> 9906.90s]  drink wine and like make shitty
[9906.90s -> 9908.90s]  videos in mind chill.
[9908.90s -> 9912.30s]  I
[9912.30s -> 9914.30s]  am forever fucking grateful.
[9914.30s -> 9918.71s]  Thank you for everything.
[9918.71s -> 9924.09s]  Seriously.
[9924.09s -> 9926.09s]  You don't understand how much that
[9926.09s -> 9930.82s]  actually means. Not only
[9930.82s -> 9932.82s]  Jorge did you give me 15 bucks.
[9932.82s -> 9935.58s]  But that message.
[9935.58s -> 9940.31s]  I wish I could tell you more.
[9940.31s -> 9942.74s]  How much that actually
[9942.74s -> 9944.74s]  fucking really means. For real.
[9944.74s -> 9949.16s]  I wish I could. But thank you
[9949.16s -> 9952.49s]  so much.
[9952.49s -> 9956.84s]  VR Josh.
[9956.84s -> 9958.84s]  Six dollars from VR Josh. One of the
[9958.84s -> 9961.21s]  resident VIPs.
[9961.21s -> 9963.21s]  Sorry about the technical difficulties. You handled
[9963.21s -> 9965.21s]  it really well.
[9965.21s -> 9967.58s]  VR streaming can be extra rough
[9967.58s -> 9969.58s]  sometimes but I appreciate you trying to make it work.
[9969.58s -> 9972.58s]  Now I know that too. And like
[9972.58s -> 9974.58s]  look. Mind show
[9974.58s -> 9977.21s]  is amazing. It's a
[9977.21s -> 9979.21s]  great idea. The people behind it
[9979.21s -> 9981.21s]  they really give a fuck. You can tell.
[9981.21s -> 9983.70s]  So my frustrations
[9983.70s -> 9985.70s]  with the game are not
[9985.70s -> 9989.10s]  necessarily
[9989.10s -> 9991.10s]  take it with a grain of salt. Because
[9991.10s -> 9993.10s]  I mean we had some issues with it but it was
[9993.10s -> 9995.10s]  still a lot of fun. It really was.
[9995.10s -> 9999.32s]  I don't mean my frustrations
[9999.32s -> 10001.32s]  to be taken out on the developers of the
[10001.32s -> 10003.62s]  game. Because I do think it's
[10003.62s -> 10007.72s]  really great. I hope they continue
[10007.72s -> 10009.72s]  to improve it. I hope it's continue
[10009.72s -> 10016.25s]  I mean it's a great concept.
[10016.25s -> 10018.25s]  But thank you Josh. VR
[10018.25s -> 10022.54s]  Josh. I loved
[10022.54s -> 10026.82s]  it. I had a lot of fun.
[10026.82s -> 10028.82s]  I still think. I would still recommend that
[10028.82s -> 10031.13s]  game. Just because of what they're trying
[10031.13s -> 10035.67s]  to do with the platform. It was good shit.
[10035.67s -> 10038.23s]  For real. Hey pizza
[10038.23s -> 10041.18s]  bot. Pizza bot.
[10041.18s -> 10043.18s]  Five dollars from pizza bot. This is a fever
[10043.18s -> 10045.99s]  dream. Yeah. That's
[10045.99s -> 10047.99s]  kind of how it works here sometimes.
[10047.99s -> 10050.81s]  Peaceful. Hey Lee. Thanks for the 250.
[10050.81s -> 10053.30s]  Hey Jeremy. Just want to say you're such a funny
[10053.30s -> 10055.30s]  man. Keep being yourself.
[10055.30s -> 10057.30s]  Going to Texas tomorrow.
[10057.30s -> 10059.30s]  So I'll miss a bunch of the streams but I hope you
[10059.30s -> 10061.30s]  enjoy the rest of your week.
[10061.30s -> 10064.74s]  Love you Jeremy. And chat.
[10064.74s -> 10067.18s]  I'm sure they appreciate that.
[10067.18s -> 10069.18s]  Thank you for the 250.
[10069.18s -> 10071.18s]  Thanks for the wonderful message.
[10071.18s -> 10075.02s]  Hey Jess. You got it. Thanks for
[10075.02s -> 10077.02s]  the 250. This is how your fight
[10077.02s -> 10079.02s]  scene directing looked.
[10079.02s -> 10089.62s]  What is this?
[10089.62s -> 10091.62s]  This is the
[10091.62s -> 10093.62s]  Liam
[10093.62s -> 10095.62s]  Neeson jumps a fence.
[10098.74s -> 10101.11s]  I can't believe they actually kept this.
[10101.11s -> 10103.11s]  Why would you not
[10103.11s -> 10105.42s]  change that? That is so
[10105.42s -> 10107.42s]  absolutely disgusting
[10107.42s -> 10109.42s]  in a filmmaking sense.
[10109.42s -> 10111.42s]  And I really, I mean that.
[10111.42s -> 10113.42s]  Holy shit. That was unbearable.
[10113.42s -> 10121.93s]  But thank you Jess. You got it for the 250.
[10121.93s -> 10124.17s]  Hey Pilot Guy. Thanks
[10124.17s -> 10126.17s]  for $15 Pilot Guy.
[10126.17s -> 10128.17s]  I'm fine. Seriously though.
[10128.17s -> 10130.17s]  I haven't laughed this hard in a while.
[10130.17s -> 10132.17s]  Thanks Jeremy. Thank you.
[10132.17s -> 10139.51s]  Glad you had a good time.
[10139.51s -> 10141.51s]  Thank you for the $15 and your wonderful
[10141.51s -> 10143.51s]  and amazing message.
[10143.51s -> 10146.46s]  Thank you. Mostly lost.
[10146.46s -> 10148.46s]  Thanks for the 250. Hey Geronimo. I'm going to
[10148.46s -> 10150.46s]  leave this Academy Award nominee by Kiwo
[10150.46s -> 10152.46s]  here. And it's
[10152.46s -> 10154.46s]  sequel which is even better.
[10154.46s -> 10156.46s]  Sorry, not sorry. Kiwo, deal
[10156.46s -> 10158.46s]  with it. What are you talking about?
[10158.46s -> 10161.53s]  Cherry chapstick.
[10161.53s -> 10166.71s]  What is this? Hold on.
[10166.71s -> 10179.51s]  This is a Kiwo video? I mean we gotta
[10179.51s -> 10182.84s]  watch the whole fucking thing.
[10182.84s -> 10184.84s]  Things have been rough between us.
[10184.84s -> 10186.84s]  Jeremy wants you to come home. Jeremy wants you to do this.
[10186.84s -> 10188.84s]  I miss you. I know things have been rough.
[10188.84s -> 10191.53s]  I miss you too. I still love you.
[10191.53s -> 10193.53s]  I love you too.
[10193.53s -> 10195.90s]  Awesome Texas.
[10195.90s -> 10216.63s]  Where's the audio?
[10216.63s -> 10220.73s]  What happened to the audio?
[10220.73s -> 10225.98s]  Kiwo, we gotta make it like a fucking
[10225.98s -> 10232.82s]  real video together.
[10232.82s -> 10235.19s]  I didn't do anything.
[10235.19s -> 10243.13s]  I just like shut off. Blossom.
[10243.13s -> 10245.13s]  I just played the video.
[10245.13s -> 10248.78s]  Kiwo went to bed 3 hours
[10248.78s -> 10250.78s]  ago. I don't blame her.
[10250.78s -> 10253.21s]  It's late. It's like 2am
[10253.21s -> 10255.21s]  Eastern. Like 6, 5,
[10255.21s -> 10260.26s]  6am EU.
[10260.26s -> 10262.26s]  The vibe may have, the vibe probably
[10262.26s -> 10264.26s]  fucked it up. But thank you Mostly Lost.
[10264.26s -> 10266.50s]  Kiwo and I will make
[10266.50s -> 10268.87s]  content together I promise.
[10268.87s -> 10270.87s]  She's hilarious. She's talented.
[10270.87s -> 10273.61s]  Of course I'd want to
[10273.61s -> 10276.23s]  make content with somebody like that. For real.
[10276.23s -> 10278.23s]  Like it's gonna happen.
[10278.23s -> 10282.46s]  It's never happening.
[10282.46s -> 10286.10s]  Hey Mostly Lost, thanks again
[10286.10s -> 10288.41s]  for the 250.
[10288.41s -> 10290.41s]  We can probably piece together the ABC video
[10290.41s -> 10292.41s]  with the first person's perspectives
[10292.41s -> 10294.41s]  when you were filming it and the final
[10294.41s -> 10296.71s]  audio from the end.
[10296.71s -> 10298.71s]  I don't even know what you're talking about. I forgot it.
[10298.71s -> 10305.82s]  What an embarrassment.
[10305.82s -> 10307.82s]  Didn't I lose like 700 fucking
[10307.82s -> 10310.63s]  viewers during that segment?
[10310.63s -> 10312.81s]  That's embarrassing.
[10312.81s -> 10315.18s]  I lost like a thousand
[10315.18s -> 10317.18s]  viewers.
[10321.02s -> 10324.73s]  That's so bad.
[10324.73s -> 10326.73s]  Okay, if I was a marketing person
[10326.73s -> 10329.54s]  I would come to me and be like
[10329.54s -> 10331.54s]  hey dude, don't fucking
[10331.54s -> 10335.19s]  do that again. You lost
[10335.19s -> 10337.19s]  a thousand people.
[10337.19s -> 10339.19s]  You lost like 20% of your whole
[10339.19s -> 10342.14s]  audience.
[10342.14s -> 10344.50s]  That's a new record.
[10344.50s -> 10346.50s]  Who cares?
[10346.50s -> 10349.00s]  Who gives a fuck, right?
[10351.00s -> 10356.76s]  It's all good.
[10356.76s -> 10360.79s]  But thank you Mostly Lost.
[10360.79s -> 10362.79s]  PastaGlobs
[10362.79s -> 10365.03s]  250, bless you for putting up
[10365.03s -> 10367.03s]  with dumb technical bullshit for as long as
[10367.03s -> 10369.03s]  you could. We love you.
[10369.03s -> 10372.49s]  Thank you. I think it was worth it because
[10372.49s -> 10375.05s]  the game is worth it. I think so.
[10379.72s -> 10381.72s]  Demias, thanks for five subs.
[10381.72s -> 10384.02s]  Demias, thank you.
[10384.02s -> 10386.02s]  Jerma lied about Minecraft
[10386.02s -> 10388.39s]  VR, five subs.
[10388.39s -> 10390.39s]  Rin the cutest, three subs.
[10390.39s -> 10392.76s]  Dr. Steen, five subs.
[10392.76s -> 10394.76s]  Sroiliat, Sroiliat
[10394.76s -> 10397.90s]  give 20, which is unfucking
[10397.90s -> 10401.16s]  believable. Thank you Sroiliat.
[10401.16s -> 10403.16s]  Sroiliat,
[10403.16s -> 10405.16s]  Sroiliat won.
[10405.16s -> 10408.55s]  Jerma lied about
[10408.55s -> 10410.55s]  Minecraft VR, another 10
[10410.55s -> 10414.70s]  community subs.
[10414.70s -> 10416.70s]  I can't fucking believe you'd give this
[10416.70s -> 10420.34s]  many subs, thank you. That's a lot
[10420.34s -> 10422.34s]  of money, it's a lot of contribution, it's a ton
[10422.34s -> 10424.34s]  of fucking, it's a big paycheck.
[10424.34s -> 10426.71s]  I
[10426.71s -> 10428.71s]  can't even, thank you.
[10428.71s -> 10432.30s]  15 community subs
[10432.30s -> 10435.56s]  tonight. I don't
[10435.56s -> 10437.56s]  have much else to say. I can't believe
[10437.56s -> 10440.63s]  it, thank you. Jerma lied
[10440.63s -> 10442.63s]  about Fruity Loops, I lie about
[10442.63s -> 10444.94s]  everything. Jerma, what's up? Like the stream
[10444.94s -> 10446.94s]  but I think Fruity Loops would be better, I do too.
[10446.94s -> 10448.94s]  And a real guitarist
[10448.94s -> 10450.94s]  to be hired to
[10450.94s -> 10452.94s]  play the guitar on the stream.
[10452.94s -> 10455.94s]  I'm working on it.
[10455.94s -> 10457.94s]  Jerma lied about Minecraft VR,
[10457.94s -> 10459.94s]  lying about a lot of things tonight.
[10459.94s -> 10462.44s]  Hey Benito, maybe in
[10462.44s -> 10464.44s]  your drunken stupor you'll reconsider your
[10464.44s -> 10466.44s]  weird authoritarian stance on enabling
[10466.44s -> 10468.44s]  the Pog emote.
[10468.44s -> 10480.01s]  Like really? We got this shit.
[10480.01s -> 10482.01s]  That's better than it, that's the best.
[10482.01s -> 10485.59s]  Do you need anything else
[10485.59s -> 10489.30s]  besides that? Man Bear
[10489.30s -> 10491.30s]  Pig, 15 dollars from Man Bear Pig.
[10491.30s -> 10493.30s]  Jerma, it's probably weird
[10493.30s -> 10495.30s]  hearing this with somebody on the internet,
[10495.30s -> 10497.30s]  but you helped me overcome depression with how
[10497.30s -> 10499.30s]  funny you are. Just want to say thanks
[10499.30s -> 10501.30s]  for everything you've done, even if you don't know
[10501.30s -> 10506.23s]  you did it.
[10506.23s -> 10509.94s]  Anytime somebody tells me that,
[10509.94s -> 10512.95s]  happens maybe once every couple
[10512.95s -> 10514.95s]  weeks.
[10514.95s -> 10518.60s]  Maybe like once a month
[10518.60s -> 10520.60s]  somebody talks about their depression on the stream.
[10520.60s -> 10523.80s]  And how like this community in the
[10523.80s -> 10525.80s]  stream has made it easier and fun
[10525.80s -> 10529.38s]  and interesting for them.
[10529.38s -> 10531.38s]  I can't even fucking
[10531.38s -> 10533.38s]  respond. I can't believe it.
[10533.38s -> 10537.67s]  I am so
[10537.67s -> 10539.67s]  happy that you can have fucking
[10539.67s -> 10541.67s]  fun here.
[10541.67s -> 10543.67s]  You can forget about the bullshit of the daily
[10543.67s -> 10545.67s]  life. You can come here and enjoy yourself
[10545.67s -> 10547.67s]  with this community, with these people
[10547.67s -> 10549.67s]  and this stream.
[10549.67s -> 10553.00s]  I will never fucking forget
[10553.00s -> 10555.00s]  that. I will never
[10555.00s -> 10557.00s]  fucking forget it. So
[10557.00s -> 10560.01s]  when somebody says something
[10560.01s -> 10563.08s]  like this, it
[10563.08s -> 10565.08s]  means a lot. It hits me to my
[10565.08s -> 10570.46s]  very fucking core. I
[10570.46s -> 10572.46s]  really truly hope the best for you. I do.
[10572.46s -> 10577.51s]  Thank you for the $15.
[10577.51s -> 10579.51s]  Thanks for sticking around. Thanks for hanging out.
[10579.51s -> 10590.46s]  I'm depressed that these fucking streams help
[10590.46s -> 10594.55s]  the ever-living shit out of me.
[10594.55s -> 10596.55s]  We've got a great community here. We really
[10596.55s -> 10599.37s]  do. Forget about like the
[10599.37s -> 10601.37s]  meta in-joke stuff that
[10601.37s -> 10603.37s]  people say. We all say it, right?
[10603.37s -> 10606.06s]  But at its very, very core,
[10606.06s -> 10608.06s]  this is a great, really
[10608.06s -> 10610.06s]  great fucking community. So
[10610.06s -> 10612.06s]  many people are
[10612.06s -> 10614.36s]  so great here. I am
[10614.36s -> 10616.36s]  so forever blessed
[10616.36s -> 10618.36s]  with this group of people.
[10618.36s -> 10621.11s]  Pin wrote a
[10621.11s -> 10623.11s]  paper on this shit. We have
[10623.11s -> 10625.11s]  like papers and like scientific
[10625.11s -> 10627.11s]  documents based
[10627.11s -> 10629.11s]  on this community. Do you understand?
[10629.11s -> 10634.10s]  God, it means a fucking lot.
[10634.10s -> 10636.10s]  I hope you fucking understand that.
[10636.10s -> 10641.67s]  You guys have given me so much.
[10641.67s -> 10644.62s]  I am completely
[10644.62s -> 10646.62s]  grateful and forever happy
[10646.62s -> 10648.79s]  that you can take something from
[10648.79s -> 10652.18s]  here too. God damn.
[10652.18s -> 10654.18s]  Like, I wish you the best, for real.
[10654.18s -> 10660.52s]  There's a lot of great fucking people here.
[10660.52s -> 10670.31s]  I wish there was more I could say.
[10670.31s -> 10675.62s]  So much money and so
[10675.62s -> 10677.62s]  much happiness and
[10677.62s -> 10680.50s]  acceptance and fun and
[10680.50s -> 10682.50s]  interesting things and interesting conversations
[10682.50s -> 10685.00s]  happen here. I couldn't trade
[10685.00s -> 10687.00s]  it for anything, even if I wanted to.
[10687.00s -> 10689.18s]  It's impossible.
[10689.18s -> 10691.18s]  I couldn't do that.
[10691.18s -> 10694.31s]  There's so many great things.
[10694.31s -> 10697.00s]  Look at the shit from fucking last
[10697.00s -> 10699.00s]  week. Look at the game. Somebody
[10699.00s -> 10701.43s]  made a video game
[10701.43s -> 10703.43s]  about this community. It's like
[10703.43s -> 10705.43s]  what? It's unbelievable.
[10705.43s -> 10708.12s]  Every fucking day.
[10708.12s -> 10711.77s]  Don't think, I don't think
[10711.77s -> 10713.77s]  about this on a daily
[10713.77s -> 10719.34s]  basis. Thank you for
[10719.34s -> 10721.34s]  everything. Thanks for hanging out. I'm happy
[10721.34s -> 10723.64s]  that you have a community.
[10723.64s -> 10725.64s]  You have an outlet. You have something fun to do.
[10725.64s -> 10729.99s]  And I'm gonna keep doing it. I'm gonna
[10729.99s -> 10731.99s]  try to keep this community going. I'm gonna keep doing
[10731.99s -> 10733.99s]  things that I think are interesting, that I think
[10733.99s -> 10736.55s]  are fun. If you wanna ride the ride,
[10736.55s -> 10739.05s]  I hope you do. If it's not for you,
[10739.05s -> 10741.05s]  thanks for coming out.
[10741.05s -> 10743.35s]  Anyways, thanks for watching.
[10743.35s -> 10746.55s]  Even if you don't think it's for you.
[10746.55s -> 10749.80s]  Thank you for giving
[10749.80s -> 10751.80s]  me even a fucking second of your goddamn time.
[10751.80s -> 10766.06s]  For real.
[10766.06s -> 10768.06s]  E-Dragon, thanks for the $5 E-Dragon.
[10768.06s -> 10772.15s]  I wanted to give you $5
[10772.15s -> 10774.15s]  for my birthday, but
[10774.15s -> 10776.15s]  now I think you should give it to Kim for that scare.
[10776.15s -> 10778.15s]  I'll give it to Kim.
[10778.15s -> 10781.99s]  Door Cube, thanks for the $2.50. This $2.50
[10781.99s -> 10783.99s]  is for Kim. She deserves it. I can't believe she's
[10783.99s -> 10785.99s]  tied in the fucking closet. That's insane.
[10785.99s -> 10789.06s]  Kim will get it. For sure.
[10789.06s -> 10791.06s]  Kim Bits.
[10791.06s -> 10793.06s]  PikaBanana,
[10793.06s -> 10795.06s]  thanks for the $5 Pika.
[10795.06s -> 10797.06s]  Kim is amazing. That was absolutely hilarious. Awesome
[10797.06s -> 10799.30s]  stream as always. I'm glad
[10799.30s -> 10801.30s]  you enjoyed yourself. Thanks for sticking around.
[10801.30s -> 10809.35s]  Thank you. Wilma,
[10809.35s -> 10811.35s]  thanks for the $2.52.
[10811.35s -> 10813.35s]  Cheer52, no message. Thank you, Wilma.
[10813.35s -> 10815.35s]  Unkind,
[10815.35s -> 10817.35s]  $5 from Unkind.
[10817.35s -> 10819.35s]  Hey, JermaBabe,
[10819.35s -> 10821.35s]  I had a really shitty day
[10821.35s -> 10823.35s]  preparing for my trigonometry
[10823.35s -> 10825.35s]  exam, but just popping in very
[10825.35s -> 10827.35s]  quickly at the end of the stream and seeing you
[10827.35s -> 10829.35s]  scream like a little girl
[10829.35s -> 10831.59s]  made my day.
[10831.59s -> 10834.66s]  Jerma Heart, I wish you luck on
[10834.66s -> 10839.34s]  your trigonometry exam.
[10839.34s -> 10841.34s]  I'm glad you got some happiness
[10841.34s -> 10844.79s]  from that. Thank you. Good luck.
[10844.79s -> 10849.21s]  The scare was very real.
[10849.21s -> 10851.21s]  I just, you don't know, when you're in VR,
[10851.21s -> 10853.21s]  the world closes in.
[10853.21s -> 10856.47s]  Nothing else exists,
[10856.47s -> 10858.47s]  you know? It's hard.
[10858.47s -> 10861.22s]  Thank you, Unkind
[10861.22s -> 10863.22s]  though. Have a great exam.
[10863.22s -> 10865.22s]  Hope you ace it. A minus.
[10865.22s -> 10867.22s]  I'm not gonna give you the A plus
[10867.22s -> 10871.45s]  here. Kim's the perfect match
[10871.45s -> 10873.45s]  for you. You two are the only people I know who would
[10873.45s -> 10875.45s]  be willing to stand in a closet for half an hour for a prank.
[10875.45s -> 10877.45s]  She's great. She puts up
[10877.45s -> 10881.10s]  without my bullshit. If you
[10881.10s -> 10883.10s]  find a girl or a guy
[10883.10s -> 10885.10s]  wherever, doesn't matter, I will
[10885.10s -> 10887.10s]  put up with your fucking bullshit.
[10887.10s -> 10889.10s]  She's great. She's fun.
[10889.10s -> 10891.98s]  She means everything to me, so.
[10891.98s -> 10897.86s]  It's great.
[10897.86s -> 10900.62s]  That's for real. If you get a
[10900.62s -> 10903.37s]  human, take him. Yeah.
[10903.37s -> 10909.13s]  Hold on to those that you love.
[10909.13s -> 10911.13s]  My sunflower seed block. What a
[10911.13s -> 10914.52s]  champ, huh? How does
[10914.52s -> 10916.52s]  one find that? Accidentally go to a Christmas
[10916.52s -> 10918.52s]  party and meet somebody and accidentally
[10918.52s -> 10922.49s]  hang out with them. That's what happened to me.
[10922.49s -> 10925.11s]  That's it. Sometimes shit just happens.
[10925.11s -> 10927.11s]  You can't plan for it, guys.
[10927.11s -> 10929.67s]  You'll never know.
[10929.67s -> 10931.67s]  It just happens.
[10931.67s -> 10933.67s]  I was single for like seven years.
[10933.67s -> 10935.67s]  It just fucking happens sometimes.
[10935.67s -> 10938.74s]  I would be the last
[10938.74s -> 10945.27s]  person to tell you that that was going to happen.
[10945.27s -> 10947.27s]  It was Burger Boy's Christmas party.
[10947.27s -> 10950.09s]  Well, that's not true.
[10950.09s -> 10952.09s]  It was a Christmas party I went to with Burger Boy.
[10952.09s -> 10955.66s]  She was just there.
[10955.66s -> 10959.75s]  Just be approachable.
[10959.75s -> 10966.84s]  Be yourself. Tinder
[10966.84s -> 10968.84s]  update. No matches.
[10968.84s -> 10970.84s]  That's it. No matches.
[10970.84s -> 10973.08s]  That Tinder shit was depressing.
[10973.08s -> 10975.08s]  Tinder sucks. Delete that
[10975.08s -> 10977.08s]  fucking app. Don't use that app.
[10977.08s -> 10979.08s]  That app is poison. Don't use
[10979.08s -> 10987.85s]  it. Kim, that's
[10987.85s -> 10993.86s]  amazing. Thank you.
[10993.86s -> 10999.11s]  Okay, Cupid.
[10999.11s -> 11001.11s]  Just be yourself and just try.
[11001.11s -> 11009.54s]  That's all you can do.
[11009.54s -> 11011.54s]  But error of paradox
[11011.54s -> 11013.54s]  thanks to the three bucks franker Z.
[11013.54s -> 11015.54s]  That's a dog. Thank you,
[11015.54s -> 11017.54s]  three dollars. Error of paradox
[11017.54s -> 11019.54s]  again, 250. Jerma, I'm going
[11019.54s -> 11021.54s]  to Vegas for my 21st birthday.
[11021.54s -> 11023.54s]  Can we please do the level up lounge
[11023.54s -> 11025.54s]  thing? It'd be the best birthday ever.
[11025.54s -> 11028.23s]  It's probably going to take a while
[11028.23s -> 11030.23s]  for me to get that going, but I want to do
[11030.23s -> 11033.05s]  that. People want
[11033.05s -> 11035.86s]  to do a meetup. And
[11035.86s -> 11037.86s]  hey, you're going to be at TwitchCon.
[11037.86s -> 11039.86s]  I don't want you guys to fucking stand at a goddamn
[11039.86s -> 11042.10s]  line.
[11042.10s -> 11044.10s]  Waiting for my signature. Like a
[11044.10s -> 11046.10s]  fucking Disney World ride.
[11046.10s -> 11048.47s]  No, fuck that.
[11048.47s -> 11051.10s]  We're throwing a fucking party.
[11051.10s -> 11054.68s]  You understand? Oh, hey, welcome to the
[11054.68s -> 11056.68s]  fucking meetup. Here's your signature, bye.
[11056.68s -> 11058.68s]  No, fuck that shit.
[11058.68s -> 11063.48s]  I ain't doing like a TwitchCon
[11063.48s -> 11065.48s]  standing fucking line meetup.
[11065.48s -> 11071.56s]  Some people have to do that because they have
[11071.56s -> 11073.99s]  so many people. And I
[11073.99s -> 11076.74s]  understand. But if I'm able
[11076.74s -> 11080.20s]  to rent out a place,
[11080.20s -> 11082.20s]  fuck it, let's do it. Let's just have fun.
[11082.20s -> 11084.20s]  Anybody's invited, 21
[11084.20s -> 11086.20s]  over. Let me see what I can do.
[11086.20s -> 11091.70s]  JermaCon. No, it'll be
[11091.70s -> 11094.20s]  a lot smaller than that. We
[11094.20s -> 11096.20s]  can like trickle into the casino and just dick around
[11096.20s -> 11098.20s]  for a little while. Put like fucking 20
[11098.20s -> 11100.20s]  bucks on a double zero. Why not?
[11100.20s -> 11103.34s]  Fuck it, let's do it. I'm done.
[11103.34s -> 11114.09s]  Should be fun.
[11114.09s -> 11116.09s]  21. Gotta be 21.
[11116.09s -> 11118.33s]  And only like four people.
[11118.33s -> 11120.33s]  You know what? If four people show
[11120.33s -> 11122.33s]  up, then that's
[11122.33s -> 11124.33s]  great. Thanks for coming.
[11124.33s -> 11126.95s]  I will treat you
[11126.95s -> 11128.95s]  like fucking royalty.
[11128.95s -> 11133.99s]  If you decide to show up. Seriously.
[11133.99s -> 11136.49s]  You guys don't even understand.
[11141.74s -> 11143.74s]  When I went to TwitchCon, there's a quick little story.
[11143.74s -> 11146.17s]  TwitchCon last year,
[11146.17s -> 11148.17s]  or like two years ago, whenever
[11148.17s -> 11150.17s]  it was in Long Beach.
[11150.17s -> 11152.73s]  One person
[11152.73s -> 11154.73s]  came to the
[11154.73s -> 11156.73s]  meetup that I put on Twitter.
[11156.73s -> 11159.35s]  It was Red Ranger. Not sure if they're
[11159.35s -> 11161.35s]  still around in the community or not, but regardless.
[11161.35s -> 11164.68s]  That's who
[11164.68s -> 11166.68s]  we hung out for like fucking
[11166.68s -> 11171.86s]  45 minutes.
[11171.86s -> 11173.86s]  I don't give a shit about
[11173.86s -> 11176.10s]  how fucking many
[11176.10s -> 11178.10s]  people are there, how big the line is,
[11178.10s -> 11180.10s]  oh yeah, policy.
[11180.10s -> 11185.59s]  I don't give a shit.
[11185.59s -> 11187.59s]  We sat and we fucking talked and we hung out
[11187.59s -> 11192.84s]  for like a fucking hour. One person.
[11192.84s -> 11195.72s]  I don't fucking care.
[11195.72s -> 11198.92s]  That person
[11198.92s -> 11201.35s]  watched the streams,
[11201.35s -> 11203.66s]  cared about this content,
[11203.66s -> 11206.65s]  cared about this community.
[11206.65s -> 11208.65s]  I don't fucking care if one person, I don't care if fucking
[11208.65s -> 11210.65s]  ten people, five people, I don't give a shit.
[11210.65s -> 11213.34s]  One fucking person
[11213.34s -> 11215.34s]  could go and it would like light up my
[11215.34s -> 11219.62s]  life. I don't care.
[11219.62s -> 11221.62s]  I don't give a shit about all that.
[11221.62s -> 11223.93s]  I really don't. I hope you fucking know that.
[11223.93s -> 11227.26s]  The one guy could
[11227.26s -> 11229.26s]  show up. That would be fucking great.
[11229.26s -> 11231.26s]  We would have a blast. I would do karaoke.
[11231.26s -> 11234.65s]  Who cares?
[11234.65s -> 11236.65s]  If 200 people show up,
[11236.65s -> 11239.91s]  I hope I can give you all attention.
[11239.91s -> 11248.68s]  Do you mind if I get drunk as fuck?
[11248.68s -> 11250.68s]  Get drunk as fuck. It's Vegas.
[11250.68s -> 11255.93s]  It's Las Vegas, dude.
[11255.93s -> 11257.93s]  What do you mean, do you care if I get drunk?
[11257.93s -> 11261.51s]  It's Las Vegas, Nevada.
[11261.51s -> 11263.75s]  Just be safe. Don't fucking drive.
[11263.75s -> 11265.75s]  Don't do that shit.
[11265.75s -> 11267.75s]  Get a Lyft, get an Uber to your AirBnB
[11267.75s -> 11269.75s]  or hotel. The hotels are all right here.
[11269.75s -> 11272.31s]  Get a room for like 30
[11272.31s -> 11274.31s]  bucks at fucking MGM. They're like
[11274.31s -> 11281.10s]  nothing. Does the open bar have
[11281.10s -> 11283.10s]  milkshakes?
[11283.10s -> 11286.23s]  Maybe. It depends. Staying in
[11286.23s -> 11288.23s]  an AirBnB in Vegas.
[11288.23s -> 11297.37s]  But for real, I don't
[11297.37s -> 11299.37s]  care if one person wants to
[11299.37s -> 11301.80s]  say hello or a thousand.
[11301.80s -> 11303.80s]  We've done meetups before. I don't do
[11303.80s -> 11306.36s]  Twitch or like YouTube
[11306.36s -> 11309.05s]  sponsored meetups.
[11309.05s -> 11311.05s]  The last time I did one, we just filled up a lobby
[11311.05s -> 11313.05s]  and just hung out for like fucking two or three hours.
[11313.05s -> 11318.94s]  I don't
[11318.94s -> 11322.33s]  give a shit about that.
[11322.33s -> 11324.33s]  I don't care about feeding people through fucking
[11324.33s -> 11329.64s]  goddamn line.
[11329.64s -> 11331.64s]  And I might be talking shit
[11331.64s -> 11333.64s]  right now. But whatever.
[11333.64s -> 11342.92s]  I don't care. Deodorant is
[11342.92s -> 11344.92s]  necessary.
[11344.92s -> 11350.41s]  It is. We're in. But
[11350.41s -> 11353.22s]  I'm not gonna stand on a soapbox
[11353.22s -> 11357.70s]  anymore. If I do it,
[11357.70s -> 11359.70s]  you'll know well in advance.
[11359.70s -> 11368.02s]  But each and every fucking
[11368.02s -> 11370.02s]  one of you has grown this channel.
[11370.02s -> 11372.02s]  Has stuck with this channel.
[11372.02s -> 11374.71s]  So why wouldn't I value
[11374.71s -> 11376.71s]  every fucking single one of you?
[11376.71s -> 11380.62s]  The reason why, oh you had
[11380.62s -> 11382.62s]  4500 fucking people watching?
[11382.62s -> 11384.62s]  That's like top 10, top 20 on Twitch.
[11384.62s -> 11386.98s]  Are you serious?
[11386.98s -> 11388.98s]  What? I'm not gonna give you the credit that you deserve
[11388.98s -> 11391.86s]  for that? Are you serious?
[11391.86s -> 11393.86s]  Like that's such a huge fucking deal.
[11393.86s -> 11399.18s]  A shitload of you make
[11399.18s -> 11401.18s]  this channel as popular and as
[11401.18s -> 11404.18s]  interesting as it is.
[11404.18s -> 11406.18s]  Never fucking forget that.
[11406.18s -> 11408.18s]  Never, ever, fucking
[11408.18s -> 11411.51s]  ever forget that.
[11411.51s -> 11417.91s]  Ever. Oh look at me.
[11417.91s -> 11427.58s]  2020.
[11427.58s -> 11429.58s]  For me to get up here and like
[11429.58s -> 11432.01s]  drink a bottle of wine
[11432.01s -> 11434.01s]  and like act out my dumb fucking
[11434.01s -> 11436.44s]  skits. And you're
[11436.44s -> 11438.44s]  watching. Like I don't
[11438.44s -> 11440.44s]  have anything else to tell you.
[11440.44s -> 11443.45s]  That's remarkable that somebody would do
[11443.45s -> 11447.80s]  that. But Superman,
[11447.80s -> 11449.80s]  thanks for the 297.
[11449.80s -> 11452.55s]  He's knocking shit over. Now that's an empty cup.
[11452.55s -> 11455.18s]  Jerma, I got a vibe.
[11455.18s -> 11457.18s]  I have to see how much fun you're having with it.
[11457.18s -> 11459.18s]  And I can't stop playing Beat Saber. What a great game.
[11459.18s -> 11461.18s]  By the way.
[11461.18s -> 11463.18s]  Also, my stepbrother and I are going to Vegas
[11463.18s -> 11465.18s]  next week. What's my favorite
[11465.18s -> 11467.18s]  places you've been to?
[11467.18s -> 11469.18s]  And where do you want to go? Best wishes.
[11469.18s -> 11471.61s]  Well, I told you
[11471.61s -> 11474.62s]  my favorite casino is the Aria.
[11474.62s -> 11476.62s]  It's just that everything is in the Aria. I love the Aria.
[11476.62s -> 11478.92s]  Downtown Vegas is great.
[11478.92s -> 11482.44s]  If you get to Fremont Street
[11482.44s -> 11484.44s]  for real. It's a great
[11484.44s -> 11486.44s]  place. A lot of good pizza.
[11486.44s -> 11488.44s]  Evil Knievel's got great pizza.
[11488.44s -> 11491.32s]  Aria. The Aria.
[11491.32s -> 11493.32s]  Like this, right? The Aria.
[11493.32s -> 11495.82s]  Like that.
[11495.82s -> 11500.10s]  There you go. The Aria.
[11500.10s -> 11503.62s]  If you want to walk the strip, it takes about
[11503.62s -> 11505.62s]  two plus hours to walk the whole
[11505.62s -> 11507.62s]  thing. So just the whole thing.
[11507.62s -> 11509.62s]  I've had a few glasses of wine. Give me a break.
[11509.62s -> 11514.36s]  Takes about two hours to walk the whole thing.
[11514.36s -> 11517.50s]  Wouldn't recommend it. Stay somewhere.
[11517.50s -> 11520.95s]  Go to Hash House
[11520.95s -> 11522.95s]  Agogo at the Link.
[11522.95s -> 11525.58s]  The Link is, I mean, the casino is alright.
[11525.58s -> 11527.58s]  And the drinks are alright.
[11527.58s -> 11529.58s]  And the place is alright. But Hash House Agogo
[11529.58s -> 11531.58s]  at the Link
[11531.58s -> 11533.58s]  has the best cheeseburger
[11533.58s -> 11535.58s]  I have ever eaten.
[11535.58s -> 11537.58s]  It is the best I have ever
[11537.58s -> 11539.58s]  consumed in my entire 34 years
[11539.58s -> 11541.58s]  on the planet.
[11541.58s -> 11543.75s]  Hash House Agogo. Fucking go there and eat their food.
[11543.75s -> 11545.75s]  It's fantastic.
[11545.75s -> 11548.18s]  That is not sponsored. It's just real life.
[11548.18s -> 11550.18s]  It's just real life.
[11550.18s -> 11555.50s]  Okay? It's great.
[11555.50s -> 11557.50s]  They do like a lace burger.
[11557.50s -> 11559.50s]  They flatten it out. I want to go there
[11559.50s -> 11562.12s]  right now. It's just fucking reality.
[11562.12s -> 11570.57s]  Streamer condones hash
[11570.57s -> 11573.26s]  consumption.
[11573.26s -> 11575.26s]  Well, if it's Hash House Agogo, then yeah.
[11575.26s -> 11579.35s]  But thank you Superman.
[11579.35s -> 11581.78s]  Hope you have fun in Vegas.
[11581.78s -> 11583.78s]  Enjoy it. Just don't let it consume you.
[11583.78s -> 11586.28s]  There's a lot to do in Vegas.
[11586.28s -> 11588.28s]  Just be responsible.
[11588.28s -> 11590.97s]  Hazy thanks to the $5. They said shave.
[11590.97s -> 11592.97s]  I will in a few days.
[11592.97s -> 11595.91s]  Internet Jorge. $15
[11595.91s -> 11597.91s]  Internet Jorge. If JermaCon
[11597.91s -> 11599.91s]  actually happens, summer will be
[11599.91s -> 11601.91s]  awesome since I'm off
[11601.91s -> 11603.91s]  and request to work off. Jerma, I'm challenging
[11603.91s -> 11605.91s]  you to drink off.
[11605.91s -> 11608.41s]  I read that so wrong.
[11608.41s -> 11610.71s]  It's not going to be JermaCon. I don't want my
[11610.71s -> 11612.71s]  name in that shit. I'd rather
[11612.71s -> 11615.66s]  it be like the hangout
[11615.66s -> 11617.66s]  session or something.
[11617.66s -> 11620.28s]  I don't know. JermaCon
[11620.28s -> 11623.29s]  sounds a little pretentious.
[11623.29s -> 11627.90s]  I'm going to
[11627.90s -> 11629.90s]  get in touch with MGM. I really
[11629.90s -> 11631.90s]  am. I swear to God this is real.
[11631.90s -> 11636.18s]  Grill MasterCon. If you can
[11636.18s -> 11638.18s]  make it, I'll talk. If it happens,
[11638.18s -> 11641.83s]  I'll talk about it a lot more.
[11641.83s -> 11643.83s]  21 plus. We'll see if I can get
[11643.83s -> 11645.83s]  a private party. It'll be fun.
[11645.83s -> 11649.48s]  Thanks for the $15.
[11649.48s -> 11652.62s]  Something or utter
[11652.62s -> 11654.79s]  thanks for the $2.50. Can't wait for
[11654.79s -> 11656.79s]  JermaCon. Hope you can handle your liquor better at
[11656.79s -> 11658.79s]  the open bar. I'm good.
[11658.79s -> 11661.35s]  Thank you Bingo Sunshine for the $15.
[11661.35s -> 11663.35s]  I'm going to charge back these bits
[11663.35s -> 11665.35s]  if you don't stream tomorrow.
[11668.04s -> 11673.34s]  Come on.
[11673.34s -> 11676.15s]  I might...
[11676.15s -> 11678.90s]  God damn it. I'll try.
[11678.90s -> 11681.14s]  I didn't think I was going to drink this much
[11681.14s -> 11684.47s]  wine. I might have to fucking
[11684.47s -> 11686.47s]  sleep tomorrow. What a fucking
[11686.47s -> 11690.62s]  asshole.
[11690.62s -> 11692.62s]  And I took three days off.
[11692.62s -> 11694.62s]  What is this, like an eight hour stream?
[11694.62s -> 11696.62s]  I'll see you in a few days. I'm going to take another
[11696.62s -> 11698.62s]  few days off.
[11701.30s -> 11703.61s]  God damn it.
[11703.61s -> 11710.07s]  I appreciate the fact that people
[11710.07s -> 11712.07s]  really, for the most part,
[11712.07s -> 11717.45s]  they don't care.
[11717.45s -> 11719.45s]  The more that you guys understand, the more that
[11719.45s -> 11721.45s]  I can do the things that I want to do.
[11721.45s -> 11725.98s]  You understand? We talked
[11725.98s -> 11727.98s]  about it a lot. I don't have like a schedule.
[11727.98s -> 11729.98s]  I don't want a schedule.
[11729.98s -> 11732.22s]  I want to just do it
[11732.22s -> 11734.22s]  whenever, you know? Whenever I'm fucking
[11734.22s -> 11736.22s]  happy. Which is a lot,
[11736.22s -> 11739.03s]  right? I never want to force
[11739.03s -> 11741.03s]  myself or push myself
[11741.03s -> 11743.72s]  to do things I don't really necessarily
[11743.72s -> 11750.25s]  want to do, right? I've been doing this
[11750.25s -> 11756.07s]  for a long time. I hope you
[11756.07s -> 11758.25s]  understand that every
[11758.25s -> 11760.25s]  single fucking time I press that start
[11760.25s -> 11762.25s]  every time, every
[11762.25s -> 11764.25s]  single fucking time
[11764.25s -> 11766.68s]  that I press that start
[11766.68s -> 11769.37s]  streaming button on OBS.
[11769.37s -> 11771.37s]  I want you to have as much fun as possible.
[11771.37s -> 11774.25s]  So if somebody says, oh you took like three
[11774.25s -> 11776.25s]  or four days off, I just, I
[11776.25s -> 11778.25s]  just know that that, I want to make sure
[11778.25s -> 11780.25s]  every stream is fucking good
[11780.25s -> 11784.98s]  and fun for you. And sometimes I
[11784.98s -> 11790.42s]  have to take that time. I was like that
[11790.42s -> 11792.42s]  on YouTube. I mean maybe I'm not,
[11792.42s -> 11794.42s]  I don't stream as much as other people do, but
[11794.42s -> 11797.88s]  that's just kind of the way I work.
[11797.88s -> 11802.04s]  He's getting sentimental
[11802.04s -> 11804.04s]  again. No, you guys fucking get it.
[11804.04s -> 11806.04s]  You really do. You guys fucking get it.
[11806.04s -> 11813.72s]  An actor.
[11813.72s -> 11816.79s]  No.
[11816.79s -> 11819.35s]  I couldn't ask for a fucking better life
[11819.35s -> 11821.35s]  and a better group of fucking people.
[11821.35s -> 11823.91s]  Like get it, you know.
[11823.91s -> 11828.18s]  God damn.
[11828.18s -> 11832.47s]  If only you guys knew. I say
[11832.47s -> 11834.47s]  it a lot and we've been talking about it for a long time
[11834.47s -> 11837.54s]  tonight. But my god.
[11837.54s -> 11847.27s]  Just wait, wait.
[11847.27s -> 11849.51s]  Another few weeks.
[11849.51s -> 11852.46s]  I got a lot of stuff planned.
[11852.46s -> 11861.98s]  Thank you.
[11861.98s -> 11863.98s]  It feels good to be funny. I finally found someone who can
[11863.98s -> 11865.98s]  make me laugh. I feel you.
[11865.98s -> 11869.62s]  Never change. Lord knows we need
[11869.62s -> 11871.62s]  more loving and well-meaning people.
[11871.62s -> 11874.31s]  Like yourself.
[11874.31s -> 11876.31s]  Fighting just a bunch of laughs and much needed.
[11876.31s -> 11879.37s]  I just want to
[11879.37s -> 11882.06s]  have a good time. That's all I
[11882.06s -> 11884.42s]  care about, you know.
[11884.42s -> 11886.42s]  In a world that's so fucking crazy.
[11886.42s -> 11888.42s]  We live in like a crazy fucking world.
[11888.42s -> 11893.74s]  The world is crazy.
[11893.74s -> 11895.74s]  In a society. In this society.
[11895.74s -> 11901.88s]  This is as much of an
[11901.88s -> 11906.04s]  outlet for me as it is for you.
[11906.04s -> 11908.79s]  I hope you understand that.
[11908.79s -> 11910.79s]  This is the Joker backstory.
[11910.79s -> 11912.79s]  We live in a society
[11912.79s -> 11914.79s]  where if you're fucking good at something,
[11914.79s -> 11917.67s]  fucking trees
[11917.67s -> 11922.66s]  regrowing. I'll never
[11922.66s -> 11924.66s]  be the biggest streamer. I'll never be the fucking most
[11924.66s -> 11926.66s]  respected streamer. Maybe.
[11926.66s -> 11928.97s]  But I got you guys.
[11928.97s -> 11930.97s]  I got this fucking group of people.
[11930.97s -> 11933.53s]  You all get this shit. You all understand.
[11933.53s -> 11935.77s]  I don't need anything more.
[11935.77s -> 11937.77s]  I don't need anything else.
[11937.77s -> 11940.07s]  I got a fucking group of funny fucking
[11940.07s -> 11943.08s]  people. I don't give
[11943.08s -> 11945.08s]  a fuck about anything else. Are you kidding me?
[11945.08s -> 11947.32s]  You think I give a shit about being
[11947.32s -> 11949.32s]  like the most popular?
[11949.32s -> 11951.32s]  I've got to make sure my post gets
[11951.32s -> 11953.32s]  20,000
[11953.32s -> 11955.32s]  thumbs up. I don't give a fuck.
[11955.32s -> 11959.54s]  Holy shit.
[11959.54s -> 11961.85s]  I don't care at all.
[11961.85s -> 11963.85s]  Hopefully this video can get
[11963.85s -> 11965.85s]  10,000 likes.
[11965.85s -> 11969.18s]  Please give. No.
[11969.18s -> 11971.18s]  I don't give a flying fuck about that.
[11971.18s -> 11981.02s]  Fuck that. Let's just have
[11981.02s -> 11984.28s]  fun. I'm getting worried about
[11984.28s -> 11986.28s]  him. No. Don't. Don't. Don't.
[11986.28s -> 11992.74s]  Don't. Wine gives him
[11992.74s -> 11994.74s]  the pot. I'm not going to swear for the rest of the stream.
[11994.74s -> 11997.62s]  I promise.
[11997.62s -> 12001.21s]  Not one more time.
[12001.21s -> 12004.54s]  Hey, Thevious!
[12004.54s -> 12006.54s]  Thanks for the five dollars.
[12006.54s -> 12008.54s]  I'm glad I got to
[12008.54s -> 12010.54s]  catch your stream today. It's honestly been one of my favorites.
[12010.54s -> 12012.54s]  Hope you play more VR
[12012.54s -> 12014.54s]  horror games. I had a
[12014.54s -> 12016.54s]  relationship and the other day.
[12016.54s -> 12018.54s]  And this really helped my mood.
[12018.54s -> 12020.54s]  It was only about a month long or so.
[12020.54s -> 12022.54s]  So I'm not completely torn.
[12022.54s -> 12024.54s]  But it was still rough since I'm dealing
[12024.54s -> 12026.54s]  with college finals.
[12026.54s -> 12028.54s]  Just wanted you to know that I appreciate your streams.
[12028.54s -> 12030.54s]  Thanks for great stream.
[12030.54s -> 12036.68s]  Turn my heart. I'm really sorry to hear that.
[12036.68s -> 12040.50s]  The one
[12040.50s -> 12042.81s]  thing you can take from that though
[12042.81s -> 12044.81s]  is if it was a month long, it
[12044.81s -> 12046.81s]  was, you know, you
[12046.81s -> 12048.81s]  figured out that it wasn't to be
[12048.81s -> 12051.80s]  and you moved on.
[12051.80s -> 12054.74s]  You're going to bounce back.
[12054.74s -> 12056.74s]  Just don't worry about it.
[12056.74s -> 12058.74s]  There's tons of other people in the ocean.
[12058.74s -> 12061.18s]  Just go diving.
[12061.18s -> 12063.74s]  You know. Don't worry about that.
[12063.74s -> 12065.74s]  Thankfully, you didn't figure that out
[12065.74s -> 12067.74s]  two or three years later.
[12067.74s -> 12074.46s]  Right? Tons of people are
[12074.46s -> 12076.46s]  drowning. I got my snorkel.
[12076.46s -> 12087.06s]  But, Thievous,
[12087.06s -> 12089.24s]  Thievous, I wish you the best.
[12089.24s -> 12092.12s]  Don't let it break you up too much.
[12092.12s -> 12094.74s]  Thanks for hanging out. Thanks for the five dollars.
[12094.74s -> 12097.56s]  Oh, Zalaski.
[12097.56s -> 12099.56s]  Thanks with three bucks. Alright, look here, boomer.
[12099.56s -> 12101.56s]  Olive Chat wants 2012
[12101.56s -> 12103.56s]  beef cake,
[12103.56s -> 12105.56s]  beef cake. Germaback,
[12105.56s -> 12107.74s]  take him out of the closet.
[12107.74s -> 12109.74s]  I'll never be that fucking Jack.
[12109.74s -> 12112.23s]  Guys, I spent every other
[12112.23s -> 12114.86s]  day in the gym.
[12114.86s -> 12116.86s]  Oh, that was a swear. You're right.
[12116.86s -> 12119.61s]  I was lifting four days
[12119.61s -> 12121.98s]  a week. Oh, it took
[12121.98s -> 12123.98s]  a 10, 20,
[12123.98s -> 12125.98s]  it took like 20 hours a week of my time.
[12125.98s -> 12129.56s]  Alright.
[12129.56s -> 12131.56s]  At Jexpo,
[12131.56s -> 12133.56s]  at Germa Jexcon
[12133.56s -> 12135.56s]  2019, I will
[12135.56s -> 12137.56s]  bench press 240 pounds.
[12137.56s -> 12140.38s]  Why did I say that?
[12140.38s -> 12143.58s]  I hope somebody can help me.
[12143.58s -> 12145.58s]  At Jexcon 2019,
[12145.58s -> 12151.14s]  I will bench press like
[12151.14s -> 12153.83s]  100 pounds and somebody can help me.
[12153.83s -> 12156.33s]  We're gonna have to need a spotter for that one.
[12156.33s -> 12160.30s]  It's gonna be
[12160.30s -> 12162.54s]  live streamed. Jexcon
[12162.54s -> 12164.54s]  2019 for the level up lounge.
[12164.54s -> 12166.54s]  Alright, I gotta stop saying that.
[12166.54s -> 12168.54s]  Because that's not true.
[12168.54s -> 12170.54s]  And somebody, MGM
[12170.54s -> 12172.54s]  might be like, that's not fucking happening, dude.
[12172.54s -> 12175.22s]  Like, don't say that shit.
[12175.22s -> 12177.85s]  But, hey, maybe
[12177.85s -> 12180.41s]  it will. Maybe it will.
[12180.41s -> 12182.84s]  Swear. Ah, it's alright.
[12182.84s -> 12186.62s]  Hey, broluck.
[12186.62s -> 12188.62s]  Thanks for the three bucks. They say nice hair.
[12188.62s -> 12193.42s]  Nice hair. What is it?
[12193.42s -> 12195.42s]  It says nice hair, apparently.
[12195.42s -> 12198.30s]  Let's find out what this means.
[12198.30s -> 12211.34s]  What is it? What's wrong with it?
[12211.34s -> 12223.03s]  What is it?
[12223.03s -> 12225.03s]  I don't get it.
[12225.03s -> 12229.69s]  Nice hair.
[12229.69s -> 12234.81s]  What's wrong with my hair?
[12234.81s -> 12238.01s]  Okay. Thanks.
[12238.01s -> 12240.01s]  Thanks, I guess.
[12240.01s -> 12251.00s]  Okay. Alright.
[12251.00s -> 12254.90s]  Thank you, broluck.
[12254.90s -> 12256.90s]  Jerma lied about Minecraft VR
[12256.90s -> 12258.90s]  thanks to 250.
[12258.90s -> 12262.30s]  Plebs can't Jerma Venus, though.
[12262.30s -> 12266.38s]  If they sub, they can. But
[12266.38s -> 12269.32s]  you can Jerma Venus for them.
[12269.32s -> 12271.69s]  Thank you. Skelly
[12271.69s -> 12273.69s]  Boner. Oh, I read that.
[12273.69s -> 12277.66s]  You are, hold on.
[12277.66s -> 12279.66s]  Mr. Picklesworth says, you're honestly a huge inspiration
[12279.66s -> 12281.66s]  in my life. I look up to
[12281.66s -> 12283.66s]  you so much and I truly hope my future turns out
[12283.66s -> 12287.24s]  as good as it has for you.
[12287.24s -> 12289.24s]  You're one of the most genuine and loving people on the entire
[12289.24s -> 12291.48s]  internet. And don't change.
[12291.48s -> 12295.32s]  If you look up to me,
[12295.32s -> 12298.01s]  I hope you can take a couple
[12298.01s -> 12300.63s]  of things. Try your best.
[12300.63s -> 12303.94s]  Try to make as many people happy as you can.
[12303.94s -> 12307.85s]  And be realistic about your goals.
[12307.85s -> 12311.67s]  Try your fucking best.
[12311.67s -> 12314.36s]  Do what you can. And try to make as many people
[12314.36s -> 12317.43s]  happy as you can. You only get one chance.
[12317.43s -> 12319.99s]  You got one life here.
[12319.99s -> 12322.68s]  Try to do your best. Just do your fucking best.
[12322.68s -> 12329.02s]  Obey your thirst.
[12329.02s -> 12333.56s]  Hey, peekaboo in a $5.
[12333.56s -> 12335.56s]  We're blessed to have you. I'm blessed to have you too.
[12335.56s -> 12338.12s]  It's a symbiotic relationship.
[12338.12s -> 12342.20s]  So thank you.
[12342.20s -> 12344.20s]  Mithril Bong. Thanks for $5.10 Mithril.
[12344.20s -> 12348.15s]  And they say,
[12348.15s -> 12350.15s]  Jeremy, you're the man. I just hate
[12350.15s -> 12352.15s]  you a little for doing the ABC's
[12352.15s -> 12354.15s]  bit while I was in the subway
[12354.15s -> 12357.29s]  on the way home from work.
[12357.29s -> 12359.29s]  You can't win them all though. Laughing
[12359.29s -> 12361.29s]  my ass off. Keep it up your 35
[12361.29s -> 12363.29s]  and haven't peaked yet. You'll
[12363.29s -> 12365.29s]  figure something out. I have not even peaked.
[12365.29s -> 12367.29s]  As Dennis Reynolds says,
[12367.29s -> 12369.29s]  I haven't peaked yet. Come on.
[12369.29s -> 12371.29s]  I'll peak when I'm 45.
[12371.29s -> 12373.29s]  You know how much shit is coming up
[12373.29s -> 12375.29s]  in the summertime? You think I've peaked?
[12375.29s -> 12377.29s]  Don't even. Oh my God.
[12377.29s -> 12379.29s]  You have no fucking idea. I'm gonna
[12379.29s -> 12381.29s]  get in a goddamn clown costume. It's in a dunk tank.
[12381.29s -> 12383.29s]  And you guys are gonna control a fucking
[12383.29s -> 12385.29s]  pitching machine to dunk me. You think
[12385.29s -> 12387.29s]  I've peaked? I'll see you in a few months.
[12387.29s -> 12389.29s]  Not even like a few weeks. Fucking
[12389.29s -> 12391.29s]  whatever it is. Oh my God. Are you serious?
[12391.29s -> 12394.49s]  I'm a golden
[12394.49s -> 12396.66s]  goddamn god. Remember
[12396.66s -> 12402.74s]  that. All Mew thanks
[12402.74s -> 12404.74s]  for the three bucks.
[12404.74s -> 12406.74s]  Say it was the suit, Peter.
[12406.74s -> 12408.74s]  It was the goblin so that I can go to bed.
[12408.74s -> 12410.98s]  Hope he can go to bed now.
[12414.89s -> 12418.22s]  Jackatomic.
[12418.22s -> 12421.08s]  Thanks for five bucks.
[12421.08s -> 12423.08s]  Your butterfly effect is insane.
[12423.08s -> 12425.32s]  So many people go through life just hoping
[12425.32s -> 12427.32s]  to make a difference in the world. But you've done
[12427.32s -> 12429.32s]  it. Thousands of people here
[12429.32s -> 12431.32s]  plan our nights around you because you make us
[12431.32s -> 12433.32s]  happy. And it helps us get through
[12433.32s -> 12435.69s]  tough times. You're a gift to humanity
[12435.69s -> 12437.69s]  as a whole and we thank you tremendously.
[12437.69s -> 12441.21s]  Give yourself some credit.
[12441.21s -> 12446.65s]  As they say in Game of Thrones, the night is
[12446.65s -> 12449.59s]  dark and full of terrors. But
[12449.59s -> 12452.98s]  give yourself some credit. Right?
[12452.98s -> 12458.17s]  Minus two games. Come on!
[12458.17s -> 12460.17s]  It's coming back in like a week. Give me that one.
[12460.17s -> 12466.44s]  Thousands of people plan
[12466.44s -> 12469.83s]  their nights around you. But you do
[12469.83s -> 12471.83s]  understand that I plan my nights
[12471.83s -> 12473.83s]  around all of you.
[12473.83s -> 12479.32s]  You know? It goes both
[12479.32s -> 12483.03s]  ways. So
[12483.03s -> 12485.03s]  I plan a lot of my nights
[12485.03s -> 12487.53s]  around you guys. You know?
[12487.53s -> 12489.53s]  I want the streams to be fun. I want you guys
[12489.53s -> 12492.09s]  to have a good time. And if you're saying
[12492.09s -> 12494.09s]  that, it's a complete
[12494.09s -> 12496.09s]  symbiotic. I'm the hippopotamus
[12496.09s -> 12498.09s]  and you're like the hippo bird that
[12498.09s -> 12500.09s]  eats the fucking bugs.
[12500.09s -> 12502.52s]  You know? Or you're the hippo
[12502.52s -> 12504.52s]  and I'm the bird that eats the bugs.
[12504.52s -> 12506.52s]  We're in this together.
[12506.52s -> 12509.14s]  Forever. So don't you ever leave.
[12509.14s -> 12513.56s]  Don't ever leave me. It's kind of
[12513.56s -> 12515.56s]  a bad idea. It's alright.
[12515.56s -> 12520.42s]  I'll see you soon.
[12520.42s -> 12522.42s]  Chat doesn't know. The hippo bird.
[12522.42s -> 12524.42s]  I don't know whatever the bird's
[12524.42s -> 12526.42s]  name is. The hippo birdimus.
[12526.42s -> 12531.80s]  Doesn't matter.
[12531.80s -> 12533.80s]  Streamer forces...
[12533.80s -> 12537.45s]  But if I have a butterfly effect on
[12537.45s -> 12539.75s]  you, I hope you take something positive
[12539.75s -> 12542.25s]  from the stream. We fuck around
[12542.25s -> 12544.25s]  a lot. Look, we fuck around
[12544.25s -> 12547.64s]  all the time. But if
[12547.64s -> 12549.64s]  you take something from the stream and you
[12549.64s -> 12551.64s]  take something, inspiration or
[12551.64s -> 12554.26s]  positivity or
[12554.26s -> 12556.26s]  helpfulness or community,
[12556.26s -> 12559.14s]  it doesn't matter. That's such a
[12559.14s -> 12562.22s]  big fucking deal. When I go
[12562.22s -> 12564.58s]  to bed every night, I will lie
[12564.58s -> 12566.58s]  in my bed. I'll stare
[12566.58s -> 12568.58s]  at the ceiling. And a lot of times
[12568.58s -> 12570.58s]  I just think about
[12570.58s -> 12572.58s]  this world that
[12572.58s -> 12574.58s]  I live in now. And this community.
[12574.58s -> 12577.14s]  And I'm living in Las
[12577.14s -> 12579.83s]  Vegas. In a nice place.
[12579.83s -> 12582.01s]  And what I've
[12582.01s -> 12584.49s]  been given. Right?
[12584.49s -> 12586.49s]  I don't sleep on my back. I fucking think
[12586.49s -> 12588.49s]  on my back. I sleep on my side.
[12588.49s -> 12593.54s]  So whatever you tell me that I've
[12593.54s -> 12595.72s]  given you, always remember
[12595.72s -> 12598.98s]  what you've given me. You give me
[12598.98s -> 12600.98s]  that opportunity to lie on my fucking back in
[12600.98s -> 12602.98s]  Las Vegas and be like, holy, I'm in fucking
[12602.98s -> 12606.06s]  Las Vegas. In like a nice
[12606.06s -> 12608.06s]  place. In a nice area.
[12608.06s -> 12610.42s]  And I fucking can
[12610.42s -> 12613.30s]  pay my rent. I...
[12613.30s -> 12615.30s]  What?
[12615.30s -> 12618.50s]  That's why I take this shit so damn
[12618.50s -> 12620.50s]  seriously. Like I take fun
[12620.50s -> 12622.50s]  and this community so seriously.
[12622.50s -> 12626.98s]  I think about this shit all the goddamn
[12626.98s -> 12631.40s]  time. Paying rent?
[12631.40s -> 12633.40s]  Pogchamp? Yeah. I thought you bought...
[12633.40s -> 12636.28s]  Nah, I don't own in Las Vegas.
[12636.28s -> 12639.22s]  It was too quick.
[12639.22s -> 12641.59s]  Our vessel.
[12641.59s -> 12644.60s]  No, but it's true.
[12644.60s -> 12647.86s]  Think about that. Think about the thousands
[12647.86s -> 12649.86s]  of fucking people. Think about the thousands
[12649.86s -> 12651.86s]  of you that have decided to fucking
[12651.86s -> 12653.86s]  pay money to this stream.
[12653.86s -> 12657.06s]  It's not a joke.
[12657.06s -> 12660.38s]  It's not funny
[12660.38s -> 12663.51s]  to me. It's a lot.
[12663.51s -> 12665.51s]  It's a huge amount
[12665.51s -> 12668.65s]  of people. It's a community
[12668.65s -> 12671.02s]  of people. I can't
[12671.02s -> 12673.02s]  even fucking comprehend sometimes.
[12673.02s -> 12678.65s]  What else do you want me to do with spare cash?
[12678.65s -> 12680.65s]  I just hope you think it's worth it.
[12680.65s -> 12687.50s]  Yeah, I've had a few drinks, but you guys have heard
[12687.50s -> 12689.74s]  this before. I will never change
[12689.74s -> 12691.74s]  my tune on this. Ever.
[12691.74s -> 12694.68s]  Doesn't matter how many subs come into this
[12694.68s -> 12696.68s]  channel. How many bits come into this fucking channel.
[12696.68s -> 12698.68s]  I will never
[12698.68s -> 12701.43s]  change this tune. And if I do,
[12701.43s -> 12703.99s]  tell me about it.
[12703.99s -> 12706.94s]  If I ever change this shit,
[12706.94s -> 12709.30s]  if I ever start acting a different
[12709.30s -> 12711.80s]  fucking way, start acting like
[12711.80s -> 12713.80s]  I deserve this. I deserve something.
[12713.80s -> 12715.80s]  Keep me fucking grounded.
[12715.80s -> 12718.42s]  I hope you do. Because it keeps the community
[12718.42s -> 12729.69s]  fucking churning. Your tune
[12729.69s -> 12735.43s]  is raw.
[12735.43s -> 12737.43s]  You don't strike me as the type. I hope I don't.
[12737.43s -> 12741.21s]  I hope I don't. I hope you guys
[12741.21s -> 12743.21s]  think that I do this because I want to.
[12743.21s -> 12745.21s]  Otherwise, what would I
[12745.21s -> 12747.21s]  stream fucking six, seven days a week?
[12747.21s -> 12749.77s]  Every stream is turned on because I
[12749.77s -> 12756.17s]  want to turn it on. That's all there is
[12756.17s -> 12758.17s]  to it. And it's never
[12758.17s -> 12764.06s]  going to fucking change. Don't ever
[12764.06s -> 12767.19s]  let me change. Five thousand
[12767.19s -> 12769.19s]  subs, ten thousand subs, twenty thousand.
[12769.19s -> 12772.65s]  I don't fucking care.
[12772.65s -> 12774.65s]  Never let the dynamic change.
[12774.65s -> 12777.14s]  Otherwise, I've failed.
[12777.14s -> 12779.90s]  And why I started in the first
[12779.90s -> 12782.07s]  place is moot.
[12782.07s -> 12784.50s]  Don't let me fucking do that.
[12784.50s -> 12793.14s]  I really fucking mean
[12793.14s -> 12795.14s]  that. That's for real. That's actually
[12795.14s -> 12797.14s]  coming out of my...
[12797.14s -> 12799.14s]  We'll turn the camera on.
[12799.14s -> 12801.32s]  Maybe I shouldn't have done that.
[12801.32s -> 12809.26s]  Here. Clip this one.
[12809.26s -> 12814.31s]  No.
[12814.31s -> 12817.77s]  Jesus Christ.
[12817.77s -> 12821.74s]  That's all I'm going to say. I'm going to move on from that.
[12821.74s -> 12823.74s]  I know it might be about fucking rambling, but
[12823.74s -> 12825.98s]  drunk man's thoughts are superman's
[12825.98s -> 12827.98s]  thoughts too.
[12827.98s -> 12829.98s]  Because they're the same person. What the hell
[12829.98s -> 12831.98s]  does that even saying mean? You're going to say
[12831.98s -> 12834.60s]  the same goddamn thing.
[12834.60s -> 12836.60s]  Whatever that fucking saying is, you've heard it.
[12836.60s -> 12846.50s]  You look worn out.
[12846.50s -> 12848.50s]  I'm not, though. I'm just fucking
[12848.50s -> 12851.32s]  terrible.
[12851.32s -> 12853.32s]  Thanks for the one dollar.
[12853.32s -> 12855.32s]  I'm not supposed to be reading these.
[12855.32s -> 12857.62s]  I'm not supposed to be reading these.
[12857.62s -> 12859.62s]  But thank you.
[12859.62s -> 12861.86s]  Thanks for five dollars.
[12861.86s -> 12863.86s]  Look, Jerma, I really need you to do me a favor.
[12863.86s -> 12865.86s]  What's the favor?
[12865.86s -> 12869.38s]  You didn't say what the favor was.
[12869.38s -> 12871.38s]  You just gave me five bucks, which is a fucking shitload of money.
[12871.38s -> 12873.82s]  You gave me a five dollar bill.
[12873.82s -> 12875.82s]  I don't know. What's the favor?
[12875.82s -> 12879.34s]  Jerma lied about Steam Legends.
[12879.34s -> 12881.34s]  You never came back. You never came back.
[12881.34s -> 12888.31s]  What do you mean? What did I say?
[12888.31s -> 12892.98s]  I'll come back in an hour and a half and I'll do it.
[12892.98s -> 12897.90s]  I'm going to go eat some food.
[12897.90s -> 12901.35s]  I'll do it in an hour and a half. Do what?
[12901.35s -> 12904.49s]  Do what in an hour and a half?
[12904.49s -> 12908.84s]  I don't know what this means.
[12908.84s -> 12912.62s]  I don't know what I'm lying about.
[12912.62s -> 12915.43s]  What was I supposed to do?
[12915.43s -> 12919.34s]  What was I supposed to do?
[12919.34s -> 12921.34s]  Oh shit!
[12921.34s -> 12923.34s]  The loot! I never came back.
[12923.34s -> 12926.41s]  I never get
[12926.41s -> 12928.41s]  I never came back and gave the loot.
[12928.41s -> 12930.97s]  Oh god.
[12930.97s -> 12932.97s]  Wow, I never did. Holy shit.
[12932.97s -> 12934.97s]  What a terrible person.
[12934.97s -> 12937.85s]  Yeah, I was supposed to do that.
[12937.85s -> 12939.85s]  Oh my god, I'm so scatterbrained.
[12939.85s -> 12943.75s]  I'm so sorry.
[12943.75s -> 12948.30s]  We'll do it tonight.
[12948.30s -> 12950.30s]  Thank you Dorkcube for the 250.
[12950.30s -> 12952.30s]  If you still decide Jermacon is a good idea
[12952.30s -> 12954.30s]  after you leave the VR stupor,
[12954.30s -> 12956.30s]  just be careful how you plan it.
[12956.30s -> 12958.30s]  You have to consider how to handle
[12958.30s -> 12960.30s]  what could possibly be a large group of people
[12960.30s -> 12962.30s]  following you for hours.
[12962.30s -> 12964.79s]  No, that's fine.
[12964.79s -> 12967.35s]  We would go to the Level Up Lounge
[12967.35s -> 12970.23s]  in the MGM casino.
[12970.23s -> 12972.66s]  Beautiful casino. 21 plus.
[12972.66s -> 12975.29s]  I'd make it work.
[12975.29s -> 12981.29s]  It'll be fine. We'll do karaoke.
[12981.29s -> 12983.29s]  I'll sing like fucking Walking in Memphis
[12983.29s -> 12987.19s]  or some dumb shit.
[12987.19s -> 12989.37s]  No, I'm gonna play this by the book.
[12989.37s -> 12993.98s]  So don't worry about that.
[12993.98s -> 12995.98s]  Level! You're so dead set on
[12995.98s -> 12997.98s]  Level Up Lounge. I know
[12997.98s -> 12999.98s]  it sounds sponsored, but it's not.
[12999.98s -> 13003.43s]  The place is just cool.
[13003.43s -> 13005.43s]  It's not gonna be like that.
[13005.43s -> 13007.43s]  Don't compare me. I'm uncomparable.
[13007.43s -> 13009.43s]  I am an uncomparable streamer.
[13009.43s -> 13011.43s]  Do not compare me to other streamers.
[13011.43s -> 13013.43s]  As you can tell by
[13013.43s -> 13015.43s]  my fucking Twitch Docs.
[13015.43s -> 13017.43s]  Let's take a look and see how good they're doing.
[13017.43s -> 13021.21s]  Don't compare me to other streamers.
[13021.21s -> 13023.21s]  Let's see how my Twitch Docs are doing here.
[13023.21s -> 13025.21s]  Let's see. Trending.
[13025.21s -> 13027.21s]  Is German985 currently
[13027.21s -> 13029.21s]  trending? He's not.
[13029.21s -> 13031.64s]  There he is. There he is.
[13031.64s -> 13033.64s]  Okay, a little bit of a dump.
[13033.64s -> 13036.65s]  A little bit of a dump.
[13036.65s -> 13038.65s]  People have sold.
[13038.65s -> 13040.65s]  People have sold a little bit.
[13040.65s -> 13042.65s]  You gotta cool off after
[13042.65s -> 13044.65s]  a big gain like we've seen.
[13044.65s -> 13049.26s]  But yeah, don't worry.
[13049.26s -> 13051.26s]  Whatever the meetup will be.
[13051.26s -> 13053.75s]  It'll be a never...
[13053.75s -> 13055.75s]  Maybe I'll stream it.
[13055.75s -> 13058.25s]  If I can get permission
[13058.25s -> 13060.25s]  from the Level Up Lounge in MGM
[13060.25s -> 13063.06s]  Casino. Maybe I'll stream the whole
[13063.06s -> 13065.82s]  fucking thing. Somebody said
[13065.82s -> 13067.82s]  Jesus, this guy is wasted. No, Vance,
[13067.82s -> 13069.82s]  I'm not. You joined at a weird
[13069.82s -> 13071.82s]  time.
[13071.82s -> 13075.98s]  God damn it. How do I
[13075.98s -> 13077.98s]  tell that person I'm not? How do I tell this person
[13077.98s -> 13080.22s]  I'm not wasted? God damn it.
[13080.22s -> 13083.48s]  I'll see...
[13083.48s -> 13086.42s]  Hey!
[13086.42s -> 13088.42s]  You were right. It's fine. It's okay.
[13088.42s -> 13091.18s]  Mithra Bong, thanks for the
[13091.18s -> 13094.70s]  $5.10. Jeremy,
[13094.70s -> 13096.70s]  you're the man. I just hate you
[13096.70s -> 13098.70s]  a little for doing the ABCs on the
[13098.70s -> 13100.70s]  subway. Oh, we already said
[13100.70s -> 13102.70s]  Mithral, thanks for $5.
[13102.70s -> 13108.68s]  God damn it.
[13108.68s -> 13110.68s]  That guy's right.
[13110.68s -> 13113.30s]  Don't leave, though.
[13113.30s -> 13115.30s]  Did you just get here?
[13115.30s -> 13117.54s]  You know, there's a follow up button. Don't press it
[13117.54s -> 13119.54s]  until you find out you think that it's fun to be here.
[13119.54s -> 13121.54s]  We've got a great community.
[13121.54s -> 13123.54s]  We've got fucking fun people.
[13123.54s -> 13125.54s]  I'm gonna get dunk tank in like a few weeks.
[13125.54s -> 13127.54s]  Just wait till you see me in the dunk tank.
[13127.54s -> 13129.54s]  Twitch can... He's probably already gone.
[13129.54s -> 13134.15s]  Hey, Dork Cube, thanks for the $2.50.
[13138.76s -> 13140.76s]  Hey, Bro Luck,
[13140.76s -> 13142.76s]  thanks for the $5.
[13142.76s -> 13144.76s]  Hey, how many people in your community do you think have
[13144.76s -> 13146.76s]  murdered someone? I don't...
[13146.76s -> 13149.13s]  What the fuck are you talking about?
[13149.13s -> 13151.94s]  I don't... I'm gonna say zero.
[13151.94s -> 13154.38s]  I hope it's zero. Kim
[13154.38s -> 13156.38s]  Dang, Kim Dang,
[13156.38s -> 13158.74s]  22 minutes ago,
[13158.74s -> 13160.74s]  my girlfriend just sent
[13160.74s -> 13162.74s]  $5 in bits to this
[13162.74s -> 13164.98s]  channel. Why are you doing that?
[13164.98s -> 13166.98s]  Please eat your food
[13166.98s -> 13169.22s]  downstairs. Oh, God.
[13169.22s -> 13174.01s]  Okay. I'll be down in a minute.
[13174.01s -> 13178.74s]  Uh, only...
[13178.74s -> 13181.94s]  Let's get the... Oh, Kim,
[13181.94s -> 13183.94s]  you're the best. Here come
[13183.94s -> 13186.70s]  the credits. That's a lot
[13186.70s -> 13189.26s]  of subs. Thank you, everybody.
[13189.26s -> 13192.01s]  For this like dumb shitty
[13192.01s -> 13194.01s]  drunk VR, German complaints about
[13194.01s -> 13196.44s]  technology stream. I'm
[13196.44s -> 13198.44s]  watching from jail. I hope you get out soon.
[13198.44s -> 13201.51s]  That's a lot of subs.
[13201.51s -> 13203.51s]  Lightspeed subs and
[13203.51s -> 13206.01s]  Clueless Sniper, thanks for the $2.50.
[13206.01s -> 13208.01s]  I have to wake up early
[13208.01s -> 13210.01s]  tomorrow, but it's worth
[13210.01s -> 13212.01s]  staying up to hear you talk. Love the
[13212.01s -> 13216.36s]  stream, everything you do. Thank you,
[13216.36s -> 13219.61s]  Clueless Sniper. You're
[13219.61s -> 13221.61s]  a fucking huge part of this community. Thank you.
[13221.61s -> 13224.87s]  Thank you, Jesse. You got up at $2.50.
[13224.87s -> 13226.87s]  What if you do that same height party
[13226.87s -> 13228.87s]  thing where everyone gets a pair of shoes to
[13228.87s -> 13231.18s]  bring them all up to the
[13231.18s -> 13233.18s]  same height? I'm 5'8". I don't give a fuck.
[13233.18s -> 13235.74s]  Dorkcube, thanks for the $2.50.
[13235.74s -> 13237.74s]  I kid you not,
[13237.74s -> 13239.74s]  I have watched this clip at least once
[13239.74s -> 13241.74s]  every single day since it happened.
[13241.74s -> 13244.10s]  What is this?
[13244.10s -> 13256.20s]  You watch this every day.
[13256.20s -> 13264.46s]  What a joke.
[13274.74s -> 13277.56s]  I fucking love the internet.
[13281.38s -> 13283.38s]  Hey, welcome to the stream. If that person is still here,
[13283.38s -> 13285.38s]  I hope you followed. If you didn't, then
[13285.38s -> 13287.69s]  hopefully we see you soon.
[13287.69s -> 13291.32s]  Take care of yourself.
[13291.32s -> 13293.32s]  Hey, I just joined for the first time. Well, then
[13293.32s -> 13296.01s]  I'm glad.
[13298.50s -> 13300.50s]  I can't believe I lost like fucking a thousand people
[13300.50s -> 13302.50s]  during that like singing thing.
[13302.50s -> 13304.50s]  I'm going to look at that clip tomorrow,
[13304.50s -> 13306.50s]  that stream tomorrow, and be like, ugh,
[13306.50s -> 13309.83s]  what the fuck was I doing?
[13309.83s -> 13312.71s]  Who cares?
[13312.71s -> 13314.71s]  Whatever. Fuck it, it's all a good fun.
[13314.71s -> 13317.53s]  He hates his new viewers. What?
[13317.53s -> 13320.41s]  Post the fight.
[13320.41s -> 13322.90s]  Ugh.
[13322.90s -> 13324.90s]  I may have turned away a few people today.
[13327.98s -> 13332.65s]  If you're one of the people that stayed
[13332.65s -> 13334.65s]  after all that, hey,
[13334.65s -> 13336.65s]  some of the best fucking TwitchTV content
[13336.65s -> 13339.46s]  you could find.
[13339.46s -> 13341.46s]  A fucking 5.8 troll
[13341.46s -> 13343.46s]  screams at bad technology
[13343.46s -> 13345.46s]  and gets mad at bugs in games
[13345.46s -> 13347.46s]  and it makes a cringey fucking
[13347.46s -> 13349.46s]  13 second bit.
[13349.46s -> 13354.95s]  Hope you had fun.
[13354.95s -> 13358.54s]  And finally,
[13358.54s -> 13360.84s]  Frostro, thanks to the five bucks.
[13360.84s -> 13364.49s]  Jerma is a measured
[13364.49s -> 13366.49s]  experience, not a single stream that
[13366.49s -> 13368.49s]  lost some viewers.
[13368.49s -> 13372.06s]  Oh.
[13372.06s -> 13374.06s]  You guys are too much. Thank you so much, everybody.
[13374.06s -> 13376.87s]  5,000, 2,000, 10,000,
[13376.87s -> 13378.87s]  40,000, fucking 200.
[13378.87s -> 13381.69s]  I don't give a fuck.
[13381.69s -> 13383.69s]  If you thought it was fun, I'm glad.
[13383.69s -> 13385.86s]  Thank you. What a fucking blast.
[13385.86s -> 13387.86s]  I loved it. Tonight was great.
[13387.86s -> 13390.10s]  Thank you, everybody. I'll see you all
[13390.10s -> 13392.10s]  soon. I can't, I mean I'm supposed to stream
[13392.10s -> 13394.47s]  tomorrow, but I might wake up
[13394.47s -> 13396.47s]  with a hangover and then we're going to have
[13396.47s -> 13398.47s]  to, we'll see.
[13398.47s -> 13400.47s]  I don't know. I love you.
[13400.47s -> 13402.47s]  I'll see you guys fucking real soon.
[13402.47s -> 13405.93s]  Whenever that may be, in the next day or two.
[13405.93s -> 13408.30s]  Lots of water. I will.
[13408.30s -> 13410.30s]  Take care. Have a great one.
[13410.30s -> 13431.74s]  Oh god, I forgot about the stream
[13431.74s -> 13433.74s]  legends, you're right. Keep me honest.
[13433.74s -> 13436.04s]  Hold on.
[13436.04s -> 13438.04s]  I'll get it this way. I'll get it.
[13438.04s -> 13440.98s]  I'll get it. I'll get you.
[13440.98s -> 13449.88s]  I got you guys, don't worry. Hold on.
[13449.88s -> 13452.63s]  There it goes.
[13452.63s -> 13455.50s]  Stream legends.
[13455.50s -> 13457.99s]  Open it up if you have it.
[13457.99s -> 13459.99s]  If you play it. It's just a little
[13459.99s -> 13461.99s]  fun thing to have down there. It's free.
[13461.99s -> 13463.99s]  You don't have to pay anything.
[13463.99s -> 13473.21s]  It's just there.
[13473.21s -> 13476.90s]  Here we go. I will see you guys
[13476.90s -> 13479.40s]  real soon. What?
[13479.40s -> 13482.65s]  What the hell did I just do? Oh there we go.
[13482.65s -> 13484.65s]  Three, two, one.
[13484.65s -> 13486.65s]  Gifts gone out. Hope you got something good.
[13486.65s -> 13489.98s]  See you tomorrow
[13489.98s -> 13491.98s]  or maybe the next day if I
[13491.98s -> 13494.86s]  wake up with a hangover and then I might
[13494.86s -> 13497.67s]  have to go the next day. Ace Attorney's
[13497.67s -> 13499.67s]  out, that's true, but ah
[13499.67s -> 13503.32s]  how much VR? Ah, we'll see.
[13503.32s -> 13505.56s]  See you soon. Take care guys.
[13505.56s -> 13509.38s]  As always, have a
[13509.38s -> 13511.38s]  great day.
