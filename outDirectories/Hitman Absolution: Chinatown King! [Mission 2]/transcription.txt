[0.31s -> 11.97s]  Hey, what is going on, everybody? Jerma here with some more Hitman Absolu-
[11.97s -> 18.21s]  Whoa! Hitman Absolution. And this is episode two. This is the King of Chinatown.
[18.21s -> 24.29s]  And what are you cooking here, dude? There's nothing in this pot. You're not cooking anything.
[24.29s -> 33.34s]  You know what? I just like hammer punched him in the face. All right, I gotta restart.
[33.34s -> 39.98s]  All right. Time to, uh, to actually play the mission. Get the hell out of my way.
[40.33s -> 45.77s]  Get out of my face. This place is so crowded. How am I supposed to ever assassinate somebody here?
[45.77s -> 50.18s]  This is going to be like impossible. Where is the guy? Oh, he's over there.
[50.18s -> 57.32s]  Yeah, let's kill a guy that's like standing in the middle of the area. King of Chinatown. There he is.
[60.46s -> 63.90s]  Get out of the way! Get the- Get out of my face! These people are just blocking my path.
[66.28s -> 75.29s]  Uh, hello there, officer. Can I like come look at that guy? Nope. What? I was just
[75.29s -> 84.58s]  kidding. Spotted. It was just a joke. Cool down, man. Wow. What is that? Oh,
[84.58s -> 91.14s]  it makes some points of interest. I see. There's a lot of different ways to potentially do this,
[91.14s -> 96.14s]  probably. I can't believe I just lost 1,500 points just for going up there and like smiling.
[97.02s -> 104.20s]  Should I get a tattoo? A lot of people over here. This person. What's this person selling?
[104.20s -> 110.89s]  You got fish? Watch out. Let me like look at it. Oh, it looks good. Fresh fish. Now,
[110.89s -> 120.65s]  get the hell away from me. Where should I even go? Oh, oh, oh, oh, there's like a- Well,
[120.65s -> 128.60s]  that's that guy's trail. Okay. Can I walk by this guy? Is he going to freak out? I don't think I
[128.60s -> 139.83s]  can walk by this guy. What's this? Sabotage? Hell yeah, sabotage. Oh, I can't believe that
[139.83s -> 145.37s]  guy didn't see me. How did this guy not see me just do that? Dude, you're an idiot. You say nice
[145.37s -> 153.69s]  shirt? What a prick. Look at the nice shirt to you. What is it, like 1984? This isn't like the 80s,
[153.69s -> 161.86s]  bro. Sneak up behind that guy. Trespassing, but he can't see me. He doesn't even know. Yes. Okay,
[161.86s -> 167.90s]  get that bottle. What the hell do I do? Are the lights off up here? Is anybody else up here? I
[167.90s -> 177.62s]  swear to God, I'm going to get myself murdered. No, there's nobody here. Keep out. An apartment
[177.62s -> 184.38s]  overlooking the square. FitzBirdy's description. Okay. A lot of places to hide. I'm kind of
[184.38s -> 195.14s]  afraid of this area. I guess I can go. Can I even open this door? Ooh. Oh, this is the guy's
[195.14s -> 209.29s]  apartment. It's... Oh, yes. I'm going to snipe the hell out of this guy. Where is he? Can I even go
[209.29s -> 216.06s]  in this window? I'm scared to go in it. There he is. Hold on. I need an escape route here, guys,
[216.06s -> 223.85s]  because if I shoot this guy, I don't want to get in the window. Someone's going to see me in this
[223.85s -> 228.84s]  window. It's going to be over. There's the guy right there. Can I shoot him from right here?
[229.16s -> 238.17s]  No, I got to be standing. Oh, man. I don't want to take the shot. Oh, I can't pull the trigger. I
[238.17s -> 244.82s]  can't do it. Oh, I can't do it. I can't do it. Oh, I got to do it. I got to do it like right now.
[251.22s -> 256.50s]  I got him. Didn't anybody see that? There's a guy coming. There's a guy coming. There's a guy
[256.50s -> 262.26s]  coming. He didn't see me. Oh, my God. There's a guy at the top of the stairs right there.
[265.40s -> 270.50s]  Look at... Look in the radar. Look in the radar. There's two people that are coming up here right
[270.50s -> 276.17s]  now. I am actually shaking. I'm like, oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. There he is.
[279.10s -> 297.06s]  Please don't open this. Please don't open this. Oh, should I get out? Oh, God. This is the most
[297.06s -> 305.02s]  terrifying thing ever. He's looking at me. Oh, get out of here. Get out of here. I'm freaking out
[305.02s -> 320.63s]  right now, guys. That was so terrifying. Am I in the clear? Cautious. Okay, I need to get out of
[320.63s -> 330.47s]  this closet. When this guy comes back in there, I'm killing him. I'm jumping out. Push him out the
[330.47s -> 338.46s]  damn window. Choke him out. Choke him out. Oh, that's the guy that talked a bunch of crap. I'm
[338.46s -> 343.32s]  breaking his neck. Remember this guy? This is the guy that said, oh, what do you like? What do you...
[343.32s -> 355.13s]  Nice shirt. Yeah, disguise. Can I bury this guy somewhere? There's two dudes right here. Come on,
[355.13s -> 361.93s]  get in here. Get in here. This guy looks like an idiot. Oh, that's pretty morbid. Hey, I had to
[361.93s -> 369.93s]  break this guy's neck. He was an absolute prick. Oh, don't mind me. Just carry on. I gotta throw
[369.93s -> 375.61s]  that down. All right. Now, I'm this guy. I'm gonna walk out as this guy. All right. What's up? It's
[375.61s -> 384.87s]  just me. Oh, hi. Yeah, remember me? I just need backup. I need backup. Oh, my God. I'm actually
[384.87s -> 394.33s]  gonna get away with this, I think. Anybody else? They're looking for me out here. Hello, officers.
[394.33s -> 402.04s]  Good to see you. Nice to meet you. Wow, everyone's freaking out. I should get a pretty good score
[402.04s -> 407.16s]  for this, shouldn't I? Well, I did break that guy's neck. How do I get out of here? Oh, it's over
[407.16s -> 415.00s]  here. I want to just like sprint. That was terrifying, guys. That was ridiculous. When those
[415.00s -> 421.11s]  guys were like looking for me and they almost spotted me. Oh, I'm home free. This is like an exit,
[421.11s -> 440.14s]  I think. Yes. I did it. Oh, nice. And there it is. 36,000 points. Target kill, one. Non-target
[440.22s -> 445.06s]  casualty, one. Minus three. Ah, that's the guy. But that guy was a jerk, so he deserved it.
[445.06s -> 450.94s]  Three objectives complete or times three. Body hidden and headshot. Hell yeah. Nice.
[452.06s -> 455.90s]  But that's gonna wrap it up here, guys. If you missed episode one again, it'll be in the
[455.90s -> 460.06s]  description and probably an annotation on the screen in the beginning and end of this video.
[460.06s -> 463.26s]  So yeah, thank you so much for watching. Really do appreciate it. I'll see you all soon.
[463.26s -> 465.58s]  Take care, everybody. Stay tuned for episode three.
