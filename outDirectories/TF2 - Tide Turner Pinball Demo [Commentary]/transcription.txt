[4.60s -> 11.32s]  Hey, what is going on everybody? Derma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary and tonight
[11.32s -> 17.72s]  going to continue my sort of update discussion coverage on the new Team Fortress 2 bread
[18.78s -> 23.34s]  teleport bread update love and war or whatever you want to call this update this is going to
[23.34s -> 29.82s]  cover the demo knight the new demo knight shield or demo man shield and before we get started
[29.82s -> 35.98s]  i just want to say that it's crazy that stuff like this is now possible watch the ground that i cover
[35.98s -> 41.90s]  here i would you see where i started i started all the way back where the cart is and look at
[41.90s -> 50.14s]  where i ended up after four charges in what like 10 seconds i went back to their spawn got a medic
[50.14s -> 58.20s]  pulled up around the left side escaped with my life intact and i got three kills to show for it
[58.20s -> 62.76s]  this item really just makes you bounce around like a pinball like i feel like i'm inside of
[62.76s -> 67.88s]  the adams family pinball machine from 93 or whenever the hell that game came out i hope i
[67.88s -> 71.80s]  brought enough quarters because i want to keep playing like with the tide turner let me like
[71.80s -> 76.68s]  jingle them all out what 50 cents to continue hope i get a multi ball that's what i feel like when
[76.68s -> 81.56s]  i'm playing with this item and even when you're not using the tide turner to about i didn't even
[81.56s -> 86.52s]  explain like what the tide turner even is the tide turner is the shield that is giving the
[86.52s -> 91.40s]  opportunity to do this if you don't know how it works when you charge somebody and you get a kill
[91.40s -> 97.40s]  while you're charging you are able to immediately charge again which is why i say you turn into a
[97.40s -> 104.52s]  pinball and also you get the 25 explosion reduction and damage and fire reduction and damage so it
[104.52s -> 110.12s]  does the same amount of damage reduction as the splendid screen but it also allows you to have a
[110.12s -> 115.32s]  hundred percent like turning control you you can turn as much as you want with this item you don't
[115.32s -> 119.40s]  even have you know the wee booties you don't have to put those on this thing is totally negates the
[119.40s -> 125.00s]  wee booties in that regard but that's how the item works and on top of it being really good for
[125.00s -> 130.52s]  offensive measures bouncing around and getting a bunch of kills the escape mechanism of this item
[130.52s -> 135.53s]  is also really good as a demo night before when you charged into somebody if there was a bunch of
[135.53s -> 139.53s]  people that you saw okay there's a bunch of people on this point i'm going to charge in with my demo
[139.53s -> 143.29s]  night and i'm going to try to get a kill with it okay great you got one kill now you're just like
[143.29s -> 148.17s]  swinging around blindfolded at like a fucking pinata like go like where is it did you get
[148.17s -> 153.78s]  somebody else maybe you did but this item allows you to get out so if you charge around a corner
[153.78s -> 158.50s]  and you get like another demo or you get a scout or something you can immediately turn around and
[158.50s -> 163.46s]  get out and get to a safe position which is exactly what i did in the very beginning of this video i
[163.46s -> 168.76s]  get that i got the medic i got out and i was totally safe now if you have one of the grenade
[168.76s -> 174.20s]  launchers on obviously that's another way to protect yourself if you turn a corner you get
[174.20s -> 177.72s]  someone and there's a bunch of other people you can try to make something else happen with the
[177.72s -> 182.92s]  grenade launcher but if you just want to get out and keep a streak going this thing is fantastic
[182.92s -> 188.92s]  for that because it's pretty difficult to shoot at a charging demo night unless he's coming right at
[188.92s -> 194.20s]  you or you're a pyro and you can air blast them they move really damn fast and sometimes it can
[194.20s -> 199.96s]  be difficult to plan a shot on them and if you want my thoughts as a whole i think that this
[199.96s -> 206.76s]  shield is incredibly powerful i think it's probably the best shield out of the three right now there
[206.76s -> 212.04s]  are the other ones sure the other ones have a good place but the full turning control and the
[212.04s -> 218.60s]  be able to charge after kill i think are so huge that it's really hard at this stage right now to
[218.60s -> 224.17s]  argue against it being the best shield in the game right now and before this video wraps up i just
[224.17s -> 228.57s]  want to briefly go over this part of the update because a lot of people had a question about this
[228.57s -> 234.17s]  and they were and myself included i was asking okay we got day one we got day two and we didn't
[234.17s -> 239.53s]  get a day three and i was in the crowd of people that a lot of us thought we were going to get the
[239.53s -> 245.61s]  moon base the big new moon base map that valve was working on on day three and there was no day
[245.61s -> 252.89s]  three so what that means is there's more stuff coming pretty damn soon you got end of the line
[252.89s -> 257.29s]  you got this whole moon base thing i don't know if end of the line and the moon base map
[257.29s -> 262.57s]  are going to be tied together part of the same update and if they're not then that means there's
[262.57s -> 268.73s]  two updates that are coming to this game at a reasonably fast pace i'm going to assume it's
[268.73s -> 273.45s]  not going to be oh yeah end of the line is going to be out like next june no this is going to be
[273.45s -> 278.49s]  probably pretty soon with all this new stuff so keep that in mind there's still more things
[278.49s -> 283.37s]  coming to this game and it's a really great time to be a team fortress 2 player i know a lot of
[283.37s -> 288.33s]  people myself included thought okay that we haven't seen anything new in such a long time
[288.33s -> 294.41s]  does valve still care and apparently they do so it's good to know that it's really awesome to
[294.41s -> 299.61s]  see this game having a bunch of concurrent players uh jumping back into the game some new players
[299.61s -> 303.69s]  some old players that are checking it out again and it's awesome and if you happen to be one of
[303.69s -> 308.55s]  these people that just jumped in for the update keep playing it's fun but anyways guys that's
[308.55s -> 312.47s]  going to wrap up the video thank you all so much for watching just my thoughts on a couple of the
[312.47s -> 318.04s]  things in the update and i'll see you guys all next time and of course take care everybody and
[318.04s -> 322.20s]  you know it's been beautiful out it's been especially like in united states we're in the
[322.20s -> 326.68s]  middle of like pretty much the summer time right now go go like throw a frisbee you know just go
[326.68s -> 331.00s]  outside go outside and just throw a frisbee and just be like yeah just throw a frisbee
