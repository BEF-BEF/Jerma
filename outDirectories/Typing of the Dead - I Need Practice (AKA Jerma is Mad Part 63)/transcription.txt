[0.31s -> 10.51s]  Hey, what's going on everybody?
[10.51s -> 16.14s]  Jerma here. I apologize I'm currently eating some Halloween candy because it's Halloween.
[16.14s -> 23.06s]  And what better way to celebrate Halloween than to play, you know, Typing of the Dead Overkill just came out on Steam.
[23.06s -> 25.34s]  So a couple things you-
[25.34s -> 27.02s]  What's up, motherfucker?
[27.02s -> 29.34s]  They met as adversaries.
[29.34s -> 31.18s]  Who the fuck was that for?
[31.18s -> 33.94s]  A monster made them allies.
[33.98s -> 40.06s]  So the Typing of the Dead, as you can see, is a game about writing on your keyboard.
[40.06s -> 45.72s]  You can only kill monsters if you type. You can't- there is no, like, shooty gun thing.
[45.72s -> 47.96s]  There is no weapons.
[47.96s -> 50.82s]  It's only your keyboard. What the fuck is that?
[50.82s -> 53.46s]  GOOTORARIO? I don't even know what that is.
[53.46s -> 58.25s]  I'm such a bad typer too, guys. I apologize. I have to, like, look at my keyboard. I suck so bad.
[58.25s -> 62.53s]  But yeah, this game came out a long time ago.
[63.18s -> 67.52s]  And they just re-imagined it.
[67.52s -> 73.21s]  God, I'm so bad. God, I'm terrible at typing.
[73.21s -> 77.89s]  Hey, you know what? Let's make a Typing of the Dead video on a guy who can't type for shit.
[77.89s -> 82.37s]  That sounds like a good idea.
[82.37s -> 86.31s]  In the difficulty, you can make it much harder than this.
[86.31s -> 90.43s]  I can't believe I have to look down every single time at my keys. That is so bad.
[90.43s -> 93.07s]  I'm such a terrible, terrible typer.
[93.07s -> 95.50s]  Flabwagon.
[95.50s -> 98.14s]  So I think there's gonna be co-op eventually on this game.
[98.18s -> 102.14s]  But it's good to see they actually brought this series back.
[102.14s -> 106.70s]  Cut them down.
[106.70s -> 110.22s]  Phew. OK, we got through the first room. Can I reload?
[110.22s -> 113.18s]  I don't think reloading really matters. OK, I gotta get ready. There's gonna be a couple.
[113.18s -> 115.66s]  There's gonna be a few coming through the store.
[117.49s -> 123.45s]  God.
[123.45s -> 125.79s]  I'm sorry I'm not, like, talking.
[125.79s -> 129.87s]  This takes all of my brain power to be able to do this.
[129.87s -> 137.67s]  What? What happened to the words that were just already there?
[137.71s -> 142.95s]  But if you are looking for something to help...
[144.58s -> 146.73s]  I can't talk.
[146.73s -> 150.58s]  If you're looking for...
[150.58s -> 151.98s]  OK, can I have a two second break?
[151.98s -> 155.02s]  If you're looking for some way to help your typing out, this is probably the game to do it,
[155.02s -> 158.44s]  because you get to kill zombies in the same time, right?
[158.44s -> 163.45s]  The best back rubs.
[163.45s -> 165.69s]  This is actually helping me.
[165.69s -> 169.33s]  This is helping my typing, guys.
[169.37s -> 174.09s]  I'm becoming a type master because of typing of the dead.
[174.09s -> 178.80s]  Oh, shit.
[178.80s -> 181.62s]  Shit! Fuck you!
[181.62s -> 184.30s]  I love how I thought this was a great idea to make a video on this
[184.30s -> 187.07s]  when I can't even pay attention to even talking.
[187.07s -> 190.03s]  I'm such a brain dead fuck.
[190.03s -> 195.32s]  I have to, like, pay complete attention to my keyboard and, like, nothing else.
[195.32s -> 202.20s]  Oh, am I making a video right now or am I trying to use my 100% of my brain to play this video game?
[202.20s -> 203.96s]  I'm not sure.
[204.04s -> 207.18s]  Big Berza!
[207.18s -> 212.72s]  Well, those are for extra points. I get it, I get it, I get it.
[212.72s -> 214.34s]  Uh-oh.
[214.34s -> 220.52s]  Oh, boy. Hot diggity dog.
[220.52s -> 222.84s]  I like how it gives you the...
[222.84s -> 226.66s]  If you make an incorrect keystroke, it's not just going to, like, make...
[226.66s -> 229.76s]  Hold your fire.
[229.76s -> 231.90s]  Mutilate.
[231.90s -> 233.22s]  Civilian rescued.
[233.22s -> 235.34s]  5,000 points, dude. Are you kidding me?
[235.34s -> 240.98s]  Rack it up. Rack up the points.
[240.98s -> 244.18s]  Whose head is that?
[244.18s -> 249.14s]  I am such an old person.
[249.14s -> 252.14s]  I am, like, 75 years old right now.
[252.14s -> 257.62s]  All right, type C-A-Y-N-I-D.
[257.62s -> 263.18s]  Some of you guys can probably blow through this, and I give you a lot of props
[263.18s -> 265.98s]  because typing has never been my forte.
[265.98s -> 269.61s]  I've never been able to really do it that well.
[269.61s -> 272.13s]  I have a legitimate headache.
[272.13s -> 275.51s]  These guys ain't human.
[275.51s -> 277.79s]  Never seen this kind of crazy shit before.
[277.79s -> 282.28s]  All right, so what is this? What is this acting?
[282.28s -> 286.74s]  Boss fight. Oh, I have to hit I.
[286.74s -> 290.82s]  Shit. Oh, my. I'm getting owned.
[290.82s -> 293.58s]  This guy is owning me.
[293.58s -> 295.74s]  I've gotten hit by every single thing.
[295.74s -> 297.38s]  No. No, Z.
[297.38s -> 301.25s]  There we go. There we go.
[301.25s -> 304.30s]  About to rage quit this game.
[304.30s -> 306.18s]  About to rage quit this game.
[306.18s -> 309.10s]  I'm about to put my hand through my monitor.
[309.10s -> 310.98s]  I'm about to seriously...
[310.98s -> 314.28s]  There's going to be some serious rage in a second
[314.28s -> 317.72s]  because of how awful and how stupid I am
[317.72s -> 320.80s]  and how... Give me a chance.
[320.80s -> 325.83s]  That's so... Just give me the gun.
[325.83s -> 330.06s]  I'll take the gun.
[336.70s -> 339.94s]  What's going on?
[339.94s -> 342.80s]  I think they just made it way easier for me
[342.80s -> 345.40s]  because the game could tell I was having a ton of trouble.
[345.40s -> 348.82s]  Look, look at how easy these words are now.
[348.82s -> 351.06s]  We could tell that you, like, sucked ass.
[351.06s -> 359.18s]  We're going to give you, like, some wicked easy words, like am and okay.
[359.18s -> 361.74s]  Hopefully that trend keeps up. Look, oh, Sam.
[361.78s -> 363.82s]  Hog. Tap.
[363.82s -> 366.22s]  And I still missed it.
[367.66s -> 369.06s]  I still missed it.
[369.06s -> 371.30s]  Oh, we're back to being difficult now.
[371.30s -> 375.54s]  That's so funny.
[375.54s -> 380.57s]  What was it? C? B? Homework?
[380.57s -> 383.49s]  D. You missed me.
[383.49s -> 385.25s]  I wish I could do some better commentary, guys,
[385.25s -> 390.10s]  but it is mildly pathetic that my brain can't do two things at once.
[390.10s -> 394.83s]  I'm going to lose again. I'm going to fucking lose again.
[394.87s -> 397.77s]  Can I have the wicked simple easy words again?
[397.77s -> 402.93s]  Give me, like, two fro fought easy words.
[402.93s -> 410.22s]  Come on, man. Bye. Done. I did it.
[410.22s -> 412.62s]  I beat the first boss in the typing of the dead.
